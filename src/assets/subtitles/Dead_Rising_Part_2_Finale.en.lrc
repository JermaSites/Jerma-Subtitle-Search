[00:01.21]What if I just turn the stream on, turned it off, waited five minutes, turn the stream on, turn it off, wait five minutes, turn the stream on, turn it off, wait five minutes.
[00:16.59]And then did like a 72 hour stream after that.
[00:25.80]Would it be like the boy who cried wolf?
[00:28.24]Would people be like, all right, fuck this.
[00:29.72]I'm out of here.
[00:30.20]Like, you missed the 72-hour stream?
[00:44.22]Hi.
[00:46.48]Oh, I didn't tweet.
[00:47.10]I'm an idiot.
[00:53.02]There we go.
[00:53.62]Today we're going to finish Dead Rising.
[00:57.48]And those of you that were here last night.
[01:00.60]Oh, I'm ready.
[01:02.82]I've prepared.
[01:03.36]I have multiple timelines in case something goes wrong.
[01:08.04]This is doable.
[01:10.96]I'm ready.
[01:11.72]I spent some time making sure I was ready.
[01:17.34]It's got to be good.
[01:18.39]It's got to be perfect, but it's doable.
[01:23.69]I looked at the map.
[01:25.57]I planned out a route to save as much time as possible.
[01:30.00]I have a save point right in front of the boss, essentially.
[01:33.90]And I got the blue chainsaw.
[01:35.78]With about 17 minutes to go.
[01:38.42]It's gotta be good, it's gotta be perfect, but I can do it.
[01:42.57]Unplanned.
[01:46.09]He cheated.
[01:47.49]No, I didn't cheat.
[01:49.25]I just...
[01:51.08]After the stream turned off, I got some food.
[01:53.90]I came back upstairs.
[01:55.20]I was ready.
[01:55.72]I was getting tired.
[01:56.46]But I was like, you know what?
[01:58.01]Let me plan out some routes and see if this is humanly possible.
[02:01.47]I tried one timeline that didn't work out so well.
[02:03.67]I went and got an Uzi.
[02:05.35]And nope, not possible with that one.
[02:08.79]I tried to go through a shortcut.
[02:11.75]Didn't happen.
[02:13.29]I spent about 45 minutes to an hour to get it right.
[02:17.13]And I got it right.
[02:20.17]Show your face.
[02:20.98]Why would I do that?
[02:24.80]He played off stream.
[02:26.78]You don't play off stream!
[02:29.58]And my control is fixed.
[02:30.56]I got that taken care of too.
[02:38.45]To see your tired eyes.
[02:39.91]I don't want you to see my... dark circles under my eyes.
[02:48.38]No.
[02:49.72]We're playing Dead Rising.
[02:53.16]You owe us that content.
[02:57.33]Why is my face content?
[03:01.95]Imagine somebody sends you... Like, imagine you go to, like, Disney World or something with, like, your family.
[03:06.96]And...
[03:08.91]You go through the photos afterwards, and you show it to, like, the grandkids that couldn't go.
[03:14.33]And they're like, this is some good fucking content.
[03:17.28]It's nice content.
[03:18.56]I can see both your faces.
[03:22.16]You got any more content?
[03:26.08]What do you want?
[03:27.34]Just a close-up of your face.
[03:29.97]Okay.
[03:34.87]Got any more?
[03:38.31]Facecam.
[03:39.53]No, I don't do facecam.
[03:42.24]You know that.
[03:43.02]I do it like once in a while.
[03:44.68]I don't like it.
[03:47.52]I don't like it.
[03:54.76]You do it all the time.
[03:55.68]Yeah, but when I don't want to do it, I'm not going to do it.
[03:59.02]So what's going to happen is after about 25 minutes, I'm going to get pressured into turning it on.
[04:03.52]And then you're going to get a shitload of content.
[04:09.70]Here we are.
[04:13.23]Content, please.
[04:15.19]Give us some content.
[04:17.97]Now, the reason why everybody wants face cams so bad is because on the off chance that, like, snot, like a booger shoots out of my nose and into my mouth.
[04:27.02]It's on camera, and, like, I have that now forever.
[04:30.26]That's why.
[04:30.74]And that's happened probably a few times since I've streamed.
[04:35.60]I've like accidentally squirted mustard in my eye on stream.
[04:38.30]But I wasn't on camera, so it's like not a thing that you have clipped.
[04:42.06]That's by design.
[04:51.79]You already slapped yourself.
[04:52.89]There's nothing to lose.
[04:54.82]I've probably done that more than once too.
[04:57.92]Alright, here we go.
[04:59.80]We're going to get going on Dead Rising.
[05:02.58]We're in the current timeline.
[05:05.02]You ready?
[05:06.48]I have to be very, very, very good about this.
[05:10.70]So, I'm going to... Let's see if I can do it.
[05:15.03]I planned it.
[05:16.61]One, two, three.
[05:22.73]Already fucking walked into a wall.
[05:25.41]Just kill me.
[05:25.83]Kill me.
[05:26.19]Kill me.
[05:26.57]Just kill me.
[05:28.43]Kill me.
[05:37.02]This is not in the right save file.
[05:43.80]Where is the right save file?
[05:45.71]I... I told you I was ready.
[05:48.33]That means I was doable.
[05:49.99]Where's the one where I actually have to do it?
[05:57.21]Uh-oh.
[05:58.25]Did I save over it?
[06:01.87]Day two.
[06:02.59]See, I told you.
[06:04.59]I got by it.
[06:06.99]I got by it.
[06:08.49]I needed to make sure it was possible.
[06:10.37]I read on a forum somewhere that even if you beat Isabella, the game will still end if you don't have enough time.
[06:16.01]So I needed to make sure that that wasn't going to happen.
[06:18.93]I played for like an extra four minutes, okay?
[06:24.70]Which one of these is it?
[06:27.87]23, 28?
[06:28.01]23, 11.
[06:28.05]Might be this one.
[06:28.85]Let me try this one.
[06:29.99]Wait.
[06:31.71]It's one of the 20s.
[06:32.37]It's not this one.
[06:35.92]23, 31, day 2.
[06:38.76]23, it might be this one.
[06:53.60]It's not this one.
[06:54.18]Is it this one?
[06:56.00]No, it's the wrong one?
[06:57.90]Where am I?
[07:01.01]Fuck!
[07:01.31]This is the wrong one.
[07:02.95]Where is the actual save file?
[07:09.24]Is it save 2?
[07:13.03]Save 2 is level 21.
[07:13.73]No, I have the chainsaw right out front of her door.
[07:18.75]Did I just not give a fucking save and not care that I beat her?
[07:22.53]Was I that irritated by this point that I was like, I don't care, I'm just saving it?
[07:26.59]That may have happened.
[07:28.88]I think that may have happened.
[07:29.84]2245.
[07:29.86]No, that's way far away.
[07:30.76]2311?
[07:31.22]It might be this one here.
[07:45.08]Is this it?
[07:46.00]I think this is it.
[07:48.70]This is it!
[07:49.00]This is it!
[07:49.28]This is it!
[07:58.75]Okay.
[08:00.13]So you... Guys, I Mario Maker the level.
[08:02.67]It's possible.
[08:03.19]I just wanted to prove to you that it is.
[08:13.65]But the thing is, I still have to beat this on screen for you to prove it to you.
[08:18.09]And I'll be honest with you, it was a huge pain in the ass.
[08:21.43]I was so angry trying to do this, even with the chainsaw.
[08:25.84]But it's possible because you've seen the future.
[08:28.36]Okay, here we go.
[08:44.84]Fuck!
[08:45.60]I have to do it perfect, otherwise I'm not gonna do it.
[08:50.28]I blew it already, I have to do it again.
[09:00.81]You have to like turn and swing, turn and swing.
[09:02.89]I still might be able to do it.
[09:04.41]What time is it?
[09:05.47]I have five minutes to do this.
[09:21.41]WHAT?!
[09:24.09]WHAT?!
[09:24.45]I lost.
[09:28.48]Yeah, it's over.
[09:37.20]Sorry, I got... I swung through her four times.
[09:44.08]What?! !
[09:56.35]Dude, even... Fuck this.
[10:02.33]Yeah, let's pretend I've been here all night.
[10:04.33]I'm gonna talk with a fucking fucked up voice.
[10:08.21]You already would.
[10:09.61]Good grab.
[10:10.09]Good grab radius.
[10:12.59]Alright, here we go.
[10:16.33]No, I think if I, um... Honestly, I think I just have to be perfect with it, and then I'll be able to get it once I... It's backswing, backswing.
[10:29.76]When she drives by you, you have to backswing or else you're not going to be able to hit it.
[10:34.07]Okay.
[10:35.31]I'm sorry, guys.
[10:52.37]You kind of have to get... No jokes aside, you just have to get lucky, too.
[10:58.17]Like that!
[10:58.61]Like that!
[10:58.95]Like that!
[10:59.33]Like that!
[10:59.73]Like that!
[11:00.15]Like that!
[11:02.33]Whoa, my voice is back!
[11:03.79]Hello?
[11:04.29]Hey!
[11:04.65]Whoa!
[11:08.19]Don't!
[11:08.55]I have to hit her one more time.
[11:13.40]Come on!
[11:15.68]Don't you fucking dare.
[11:17.16]I need to prove I did a Mario Maker this.
[11:20.12]Oh my god, I hate this encounter more than anything.
[11:23.42]This is so stupid.
[11:36.48]Alright!
[11:38.62]I lost.
[11:38.92]I didn't do it fast enough.
[11:41.52]Game over.
[11:43.70]Yeah.
[11:44.32]That's how stupid this is.
[11:48.67]I did it too late.
[11:52.85]Okay.
[11:53.09]You saw me kill her.
[11:53.85]I don't care.
[12:04.94]You still have to do it.
[12:16.16]The truth got snapped.
[12:18.00]So, you see how possible it is?
[12:20.46]I just have to do it, and if somebody grabs me, it's not possible anymore.
[12:23.08]Not possible anymore.
[12:23.79]It's not possible anymore.
[12:24.97]No, I have to get all the hits.
[12:34.71]You just have to get lucky and spam the chainsaw on her for me to do this.
[12:39.32]And it's possible because I already have it done.
[12:41.28]So, I ain't getting stuck here.
[12:43.45]I'll watch the fucking cutscene on YouTube.
[12:45.15]I don't give a shit.
[13:07.74]Get the fuck out of here.
[13:08.70]I DID!
[13:15.02]You know how many times I did this off-street?
[13:27.80]It was so much more painful than you could possibly imagine.
[13:37.18]I didn't have that chainsaw I I tried to run to the chainsaw I tried the submachine gun you guys have no idea this is actually attempt number like probably 70 or 80. in total how much do you already know have you called for help hold your horses babe I'm the one asking the questions here what is santa cabeza and how is it connected to all this
[14:08.55]The zombies were created by you, not us.
[14:15.05]That's what Carlito wants you all to know.
[14:18.25]Who?
[14:20.05]If you want to interview someone, talk to Carlito.
[14:23.37]He has all the answers.
[14:25.70]Carlito.
[14:26.56]You're talking about that guy that took potshots at us with a sniper rifle, aren't you?
[14:33.78]Who?
[14:34.68]Take me to him.
[14:35.44]No.
[14:37.24]Not now.
[14:37.80]He's injured.
[14:40.29]And in no mood to talk to anyone.
[14:49.46]I'll bring him to you once he's recovered.
[14:51.60]I hope I don't die here.
[14:53.82]I can persuade him.
[14:56.48]I'm his little sister, after all.
[15:02.72]Why should I trust you to bring him to me?
[15:07.85]The zombies are a message from Carlito.
[15:11.64]What does it say?
[15:12.36]He's saying, look at me.
[15:13.14]Why do you have gunner optics on?
[15:43.36]Those do not even remotely look like gunner optics.
[15:46.36]They're just like regular sunglasses.
[15:48.30]All right.
[15:52.82]I did it.
[16:10.80]And that case is done.
[16:13.11]Case number five coming up from 12 a.m.
[16:16.29]on September 21st.
[16:18.45]The next case will occur at 12 a.m., which is in like 40 minutes.
[16:23.07]Hey.
[16:24.49]And it's a promise to Isabella.
[16:25.67]You've already seen that because I cheated.
[16:27.35]Well, I didn't.
[16:28.50]This is where I stopped last time.
[16:29.66]I was like, all right, but let me paint you a picture.
[16:34.08]No, Don, no paintings.
[16:37.68]I gotta... What do you mean he admitted it?
[16:39.46]No, let me paint a picture for you.
[16:41.07]If I didn't have a point where this was saved, and this was like I softlocked myself somehow, you know how angry I would have been?
[16:51.85]Alright, I don't want to die, so that's important.
[16:59.92]Give me a board.
[17:00.36]I don't want to use my chainsaw.
[17:06.38]Alright, let's go.
[17:07.84]I only have, like, to keep this timeline secure, I have to go here quick.
[17:15.06]I only have, how long?
[17:16.06]Okay, I've got 30 minutes until I fail again.
[17:25.17]Did somebody fuck with my screen brightness last night?
[17:27.05]Alright, here we go.
[17:29.79]I have to go in here, and I need to be in here for the next 30 minutes.
[17:36.34]Because it's 12.
[17:40.15]Alright.
[17:41.41]So welcome, everybody.
[17:42.17]Yeah, why is my screen brightness so low?
[17:48.09]Save the game?
[17:48.85]No, I can't.
[17:49.45]Because I have to be here when the clock strikes 12.
[17:53.58]I have to stay right here.
[17:58.54]Otis.
[18:02.68]My antique shop.
[18:03.32]I'm not going to be able to make that.
[18:05.49]Close the door?
[18:10.35]Can you close it?
[18:10.96]Okay.
[18:14.82]Spotted a guy in the cosmetics shop.
[18:16.34]In the entrance plaza.
[18:17.34]Looks like he's trying to get out of there.
[18:18.62]But someone's taking shots at him.
[18:22.93]Save the old man.
[18:23.93]Look at how much time there's left.
[18:25.05]That's like two minutes.
[18:27.19]No.
[18:27.51]I have to secure the timeline.
[18:32.23]I have in-game... This amounts to like... 45 seconds.
[18:41.24]Let's find out.
[18:42.48]How long is 15 minutes in-game?
[18:44.64]How long is 10 minutes in-game?
[18:45.74]We can find this out.
[18:52.90]Okay, 5 seconds is 1 minute.
[18:57.91]There you go.
[18:59.37]I'm wasting time.
[19:00.21]No, I'm in the exact place I need to be.
[19:06.75]He's stalling.
[19:08.01]Whatever.
[19:09.45]That's fine.
[19:13.26]I ain't messing this up.
[19:23.19]Practice by swing.
[19:25.13]This is not the wrong store.
[19:33.95]I'm waiting.
[19:34.63]Alright, it's almost midnight.
[19:36.11]And... Here we go.
[19:38.73]See?
[19:38.99]I told you I knew what I was doing.
[20:00.46]Zombie.
[20:01.06]Zombie.
[20:02.32]Uh-oh.
[20:21.65]No, no, don't fuck it up!
[20:23.49]What?
[20:23.89]Okay.
[20:25.03]No jokes.
[20:25.99]I don't have any time for that.
[20:29.17]If she dies, I have to do the whole thing again.
[20:30.75]I tried to talk him into coming, but it was no good.
[20:36.59]He doesn't trust anyone.
[20:39.53]Did I do that?
[20:40.63]He didn't mean to.
[20:42.73]He was upset.
[20:43.43]You dislocated my shoulder, and I'm missing seven teeth.
[20:49.83]I don't know what he'll do next.
[20:51.17]Hey.
[20:55.73]Hey.
[21:08.50]Okay, this is where we go.
[21:13.65]Case 5.
[21:14.57]2.
[21:15.67]Engaged.
[21:17.57]Save the game.
[21:18.69]Do you wish to overwrite a save?
[21:20.49]I do.
[21:22.11]Okay.
[21:23.27]So, I'm gonna... Let's just go ahead and say, just for the record, if I fail this, I have a complete exit strategy.
[21:36.46]Understand?
[21:37.00]Understand?
[21:40.36]I was prepared.
[21:41.04]I wasn't fucking around today.
[21:44.70]So, I'm gonna go, uh, up to the top.
[21:48.58]Number one.
[21:51.00]That looks good to me.
[21:53.09]Who cares?
[21:54.57]I have to do it.
[21:55.63]It is saved there, number one.
[21:58.31]I have to get you somewhere safe.
[22:03.65]I never meant to shoot you.
[22:05.59]It's just like, what are you... I never meant to shoot you.
[22:10.42]Can I give you anything?
[22:15.78]Can you take me out of there?
[22:17.10]No.
[22:18.46]You can't take anything, can you?
[22:19.98]No, I just have to carry you, right?
[22:22.22]Let's go!
[22:24.66]And then I remember this.
[22:31.67]Hello, Kendall!
[22:33.65]It's nice to see another human being around here.
[22:35.41]Well, a live one at least.
[22:38.16]I have to put you down, because... It's just... Follow me, let's go.
[22:44.27]You're looking for a place to meet real, live people.
[22:47.83]I know a place.
[22:50.01]Nice, Isabella.
[22:51.13]The security room.
[22:51.87]Safe?
[22:52.11]What am I supposed to do there?
[22:53.55]Be safe.
[22:54.63]Sitting around in a locked room ain't... We both had the same idea.
[23:01.08]There's a helicopter coming to get us.
[23:04.34]Why can't we just walk and talk?
[23:06.82]That's the one thing I don't understand.
[23:08.96]It's coming.
[23:09.44]I guarantee it.
[23:10.04]Trust me.
[23:13.74]Alright, I suppose I can check this place out.
[23:15.46]Okay, good.
[23:16.44]You have a shotgun.
[23:18.36]So, you need to be my... You gotta be my guy.
[23:24.01]He doesn't really aim very well from the cheating timeline.
[23:30.25]Let's go.
[23:31.97]You have to take the shots.
[23:34.07]In fact, just... I can't command you because Isabelle's on my back, but I need you to take some shots here.
[23:39.28]Very... Thank you.
[23:39.94]Keep going.
[23:45.66]This way.
[23:48.89]Go across the fountain.
[23:50.35]Keep going, come on.
[23:51.01]Go, go, go, go, go.
[23:51.79]Don't stop.
[23:59.97]Is this pre-recorded?
[24:01.43]No, if this is actually the pre-recorded one, I killed Kendall and took his shotgun.
[24:06.67]Because I just wasn't going to wait around for him.
[24:09.11]So this isn't a new timeline.
[24:10.57]Alright, let's go.
[24:17.49]Shoot!
[24:17.63]Can you stay with me?
[24:26.65]Jerma, say the word slime if it's not pre-recorded.
[24:29.35]It's not pre-recorded.
[24:31.31]When would I have the time to pre-record this?
[24:35.04]Can you imagine doing yesterday's stream?
[24:37.72]And then, where am I going?
[24:41.72]Oh my god, I went the wrong fucking way.
[24:46.38]So, after yesterday's stream, I just kept playing and then, like, what, did I just, like, pass out or something?
[24:53.27]And just uploaded this?
[24:59.05]Yes.
[24:59.25]Alright, well, I have to take the shotgun from him before I deliver them to their destination.
[25:06.71]Facecam will be pre-recorded.
[25:07.68]It has not been 25 minutes yet.
[25:10.30]Yes, the stream has been live for 25 minutes, but I have not been playing the game for 25 minutes.
[25:14.62]So, sorry.
[25:22.05]Shaking my head.
[25:23.23]SMH.
[25:23.97]Shaking my head.
[25:26.89]Come on, Kindle!
[25:34.23]Alright.
[25:35.25]Easy, easy, easy.
[25:36.17]Bait him out, bait him out.
[25:37.65]Nice shooting.
[25:38.63]Actually not that good.
[25:39.53]This way.
[25:41.65]Get close enough where I can open the door.
[25:43.63]Close enough where I can open the door.
[25:46.24]Alright, we're good.
[25:47.92]Keep it up.
[25:54.06]Hug the right side.
[25:56.88]Less zombies on the right side.
[25:57.92]I need a shotgun shot right here.
[26:02.30]I need a shotgun blast right here.
[26:05.51]One more!
[26:06.01]One more!
[26:06.31]Another one!
[26:06.75]Another one!
[26:08.07]Shoot!
[26:10.31]Get back, back, back, back, back!
[26:11.21]No, no, no, no, no!
[26:11.79]Come here!
[26:13.73]Go!
[26:16.90]Don't get stuck!
[26:18.82]Kendall!
[26:20.26]Uh-oh.
[26:21.34]Not good, not good.
[26:22.36]Alright, I'm gonna just change off of this one.
[26:24.88]He's getting his ass kicked.
[26:25.72]Hold on, stay there.
[26:31.72]Come on!
[26:35.39]Move.
[26:38.27]Keep going.
[26:45.50]Let's go!
[26:49.58]No!
[26:50.18]Why would you push me?
[26:52.04]Jokeless stream?
[26:52.90]It's gonna stay that way until I am secure.
[26:55.20]And then I promise I'll tell you like a funny joke.
[26:58.22]This is not secure.
[26:59.16]I'm in the same timeline as I was before.
[27:05.78]This is incredibly, incredibly difficult.
[27:09.10]I remember reading on the forums, people saying, the part where you have to transport Isabelle.
[27:13.41]Oh my god, man, it was so hard for me.
[27:16.11]When I was 14.
[27:16.45]Because that person wrote that when they were 14, because it was in like 2006.
[27:21.85]Alright, let's go!
[27:22.73]Up!
[27:28.28]Oh my god, this is the part.
[27:29.96]I read about this part.
[27:30.82]She doesn't get up.
[27:43.19]Come here.
[27:45.75]Jerk.
[27:53.88]You jerk.
[27:57.38]Almost there.
[28:00.70]Good.
[28:02.26]Alright.
[28:02.97]Almost safe.
[28:04.23]Almost.
[28:04.77]I say that very, very loosely.
[28:07.37]Don't.
[28:07.77]Don't!
[28:11.45]I saw that in slow motion.
[28:12.99]Okay.
[28:16.71]Shoot somebody!
[28:18.48]Just come to the door.
[28:24.66]Oh my god.
[28:25.70]Give me the shotgun.
[28:27.44]Okay.
[28:28.12]Now... Here.
[28:30.14]Do you want a nail gun?
[28:31.98]I'm telling you, you're better off with this.
[28:33.38]Give me that.
[28:35.28]Okay.
[28:37.19]Don't shoot me with it.
[28:38.69]You can walk, can't you?
[28:39.57]Just a little bit?
[28:44.89]I think she can walk.
[28:47.87]No.
[28:48.43]Alright.
[28:49.09]Use that nail gun effectively, please.
[28:52.26]The reason I have the shotgun is because when the elevator door opens, I need to make sure it is clear.
[29:02.76]Thank you.
[29:03.38]Good.
[29:03.70]Nice.
[29:03.88]See, you're much better.
[29:05.08]You're more of a precision guy than a just launch weapon guy.
[29:08.84]Alright, let's go.
[29:16.49]Isabella, come on.
[29:25.28]Come on, Kendall.
[29:27.68]Okay, this is important.
[29:28.94]Important.
[29:33.02]I don't know why I thought that was a zombie.
[29:34.83]Alright, this is... Here we go.
[29:38.11]Over here.
[29:39.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[29:41.17]Give that back.
[29:41.61]Get that back.
[29:42.47]You stand right here.
[29:44.39]Give that back.
[29:49.86]This is it.
[29:51.36]One, two, three.
[29:58.89]In.
[30:01.23]Done.
[30:03.71]Got it.
[30:06.29]That was the stressful part because look at the time.
[30:11.80]Done.
[30:13.18]Okay, well, let's talk about something funny.
[30:16.08]Yeah.
[30:23.01]Where's that fucking content?
[30:23.97]My webcam's not even plugged in.
[30:25.21]I don't want to plug it in.
[30:27.06]It might crash the computer.
[30:29.74]Not enough, like, bus spaces on the motherboard.
[30:33.88]It'll crash.
[30:53.89]And just so you know, that would be the same guy that shot you.
[31:03.40]What's he after?
[31:05.20]What's his ultimate goal?
[31:06.74]I don't know.
[31:08.46]But according to her, his plan isn't over.
[31:13.94]Not yet.
[31:17.73]Okay.
[31:19.47]Fine.
[31:20.26]There were some non-believers here that didn't think I was going to do it.
[31:25.42]I stayed in the post-stream chat last night, and I saw somebody wrote a paragraph, and they were like, he's not going to be able to do this, guys.
[31:31.81]He's going to be kind of upset about this.
[31:33.27]He's going to be, like, pissed off.
[31:35.49]We need to tell him that he can't do it.
[31:37.27]And then I stayed up for four extra hours and did it.
[31:49.36]Case 5 complete.
[31:50.44]Case 6 starts at 3 AM.
[31:53.55]I got a couple of hours.
[31:55.71]Done.
[31:56.55]50,000 PP.
[31:58.19]21.
[31:58.41]Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[32:01.41]Take a photo of them.
[32:09.01]Got it.
[32:10.09]I gotta make... Very important.
[32:11.71]Now that the timeline is actually secure.
[32:13.29]I need to go to the picture viewer.
[32:16.30]Save that one.
[32:16.94]That's a good one.
[32:17.98]Alright, I need to save some of these.
[32:20.92]pants is still there okay uh but like the rock bottom off the titantron is like perfect but I don't think this one is I can get I'm gonna get rid of this one keep pants um no this one's just like weird I like that one okay
[32:53.27]Okay, this one too, when he's running.
[32:55.47]That's a good one.
[32:59.61]That one.
[33:00.25]Never forget Ronald.
[33:02.56]And the fat lady.
[33:05.42]Which one's better, though?
[33:06.30]Yeah, that was pretty good.
[33:12.60]They're both good.
[33:18.67]That one's not that good.
[33:22.36]Alright, I think I'm good.
[33:23.58]Where's the pants photo?
[33:24.38]It's right here?
[33:30.04]I'm okay with that.
[33:35.65]So now I got a little bit of time here.
[33:37.31]I can... Photographer's... Do I have... Okay.
[33:40.93]3am, I have just about one hour, which is about 20 minutes game time.
[33:44.76]15 minutes game time, something like that.
[33:46.08]Do I have enough time to do it?
[33:47.04]Save it first.
[33:47.48]Save it first.
[33:55.57]I wonder if there's enough time to be back here.
[33:57.71]In 15 minutes.
[34:00.65]Change slot.
[34:01.47]This is gonna be... Now this is the real one.
[34:04.37]So this is slot 2.
[34:07.12]Okay, sick.
[34:09.04]I don't know why, I just thought this head game sucks.
[34:14.78]When it got to the first C, I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
[34:20.91]Alright.
[34:21.07]Alright.
[34:22.78]Photographer's pride.
[34:23.84]I need to be... Let's see if I can get there.
[34:28.79]I have a good shotgun.
[34:34.49]Explore the roof where the elevator is?
[34:35.87]Yeah, I'll do that.
[34:40.69]Well, there's a bun in there.
[34:45.61]Okay, what about this way?
[34:48.64]Explore the roof.
[34:53.89]Anything up here?
[34:56.15]Facecam now, it's been 25 minutes.
[35:01.47]That's not true, because I had to rewind two or three times in different save slots.
[35:06.16]So, we've only been like 17 or 18 minutes on the real, actual game.
[35:13.28]Anything over here?
[35:13.74]I don't see anything this way.
[35:19.36]Can I get up on top of the roof?
[35:24.68]I feel like I can get up there.
[35:31.43]Hmm.
[35:35.19]He hates his viewers.
[35:38.75]He's just finding right now this out.
[35:40.91]Monkey ass.
[35:42.31]I'm sorry.
[35:42.79]I could do that better.
[35:44.09]Monkey ass.
[35:47.08]I can't just stand this up.
[35:53.20]I can't jump up that?
[35:57.05]Oh, slime him!
[35:59.61]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[36:09.28]Warehouse.
[36:12.70]I'll take the call.
[36:13.23]It's kind of weird, but there's a group of freaks in raincoats gathered in Colby's movie land.
[36:18.35]They're wearing matching masks, too, and they're really giving me the creeps.
[36:21.61]Otis, I already know who these people are.
[36:24.67]I know to stop calling me on my novelty soccer ball phone.
[36:35.10]Uh... I've been up here before, but, I mean, the toolbox?
[36:42.38]What can I do with the toolbox?
[36:43.28]Anything cool?
[36:44.30]Fuck it.
[36:46.12]Wait, what was in there?
[36:47.54]Saws?
[36:49.18]Ooh, that's cool.
[36:50.26]Sludge hammer.
[36:59.29]Soccer ball?
[37:00.19]I'll keep the soccer ball for, like, a funny moment.
[37:02.59]Keep the... Alright.
[37:06.41]Oops.
[37:07.85]Well, I gotta be back here anyways.
[37:11.94]I can do photographer's pride again.
[37:13.48]In a little bit.
[37:16.38]There are actually saws here, though.
[37:17.70]Alright, saws.
[37:18.60]Get off of me.
[37:21.27]Okay, you know how some things in games just... It's something about them.
[37:25.91]The way they happen, the animation and the damage.
[37:30.62]For some reason, the you get grabbed and bit by a zombie just makes me angry.
[37:38.56]It's just every time it happens, I'm just like, fuck out of here.
[37:42.59]Soccer ball!
[37:53.87]What was that?
[37:54.23]What was that noise?
[37:55.43]Did you guys hear that?
[37:58.89]That little, like... Yeah, I'm just gonna get back up here.
[38:09.53]A strange group.
[38:10.35]I still have time.
[38:10.87]Alright.
[38:19.87]Do I have any supplies?
[38:20.97]I may have a couple.
[38:21.53]I have a squash.
[38:22.11]Just eat it.
[38:24.08]My supplies aren't bad.
[38:25.24]You didn't do anything.
[38:26.80]Well, I just, I checked out the, somebody said check out the roof.
[38:30.36]You can't really do anything in, like, ten minutes.
[38:35.46]All I can do is sit here.
[38:36.91]Check out the roof again.
[38:38.35]I, no, I have to be back here in, like, six, I have to be here in, like, five minutes.
[38:43.43]It takes five minutes to go down the elevator and, like, out the door.
[38:56.71]It's been 25... Caving.
[39:13.78]The definition of the word cave.
[39:18.50]A small dugout enclove inside of a rock making a dark, damp space.
[39:25.00]Other definition.
[39:26.59]Being forced to turn on your face cam on Twitch.tv.
[39:31.49]Verb.
[39:31.83]I don't even know where this is.
[39:49.06]I have like wicked bad villain hair today too, so you guys will love that.
[40:04.43]I just have to wait here.
[40:16.36]It's desynced.
[40:20.28]What do you want to do about it?
[40:21.06]Alright, it shouldn't be desynced anymore.
[40:29.17]Patrick Bateman.
[40:33.27]Well, Isabella, this is an emergency.
[40:38.28]So we'll skip the formalities and get to the chase.
[40:42.26]Consider this an official interrogation.
[40:45.82]Tell me everything that you know.
[40:51.04]Fine.
[40:52.44]I'll explain why all of this is your fault.
[40:55.48]Tastes like the lime juice I squeezed in it.
[40:56.98]There was no drug trade in Santa Cabeza.
[41:00.16]Just an American research facility.
[41:02.76]They were doing research on some sort of parasitic insect.
[41:06.44]Like a wasp.
[41:07.94]A wasp that turns living things into zombies.
[41:10.99]MDMA water?
[41:14.77]If you don't believe me, just ask the man who was in charge of that research.
[41:18.37]The head of the Santa Cabeza Livestock Research Facility.
[41:21.57]Dr. Barnaby!
[41:30.42]Wait, Dr. Barnaby's gonna be turned.
[41:34.88]Oh wait, no, he's just normal.
[41:38.81]Shotgun and head.
[41:39.63]Shotgun, head.
[41:41.09]Shotgun, head.
[41:57.85]I did go, kind of, all the way to the end there.
[41:59.76]Like, shotgun head?
[42:00.74]Like, you could kick him.
[42:15.11]Shotgun head!
[42:16.51]Nah, shotgun.
[42:17.15]This is not good.
[42:17.73]Nah, you gotta listen to me.
[42:19.16]Dude, shut- Nah, shotgun head.
[42:20.84]I was right.
[42:26.90]Stop drinking bong water.
[42:28.22]I'm not drinking bong water.
[42:47.64]Tell me the truth, Doc.
[42:51.34]Were you conducting experiments with zombies?
[42:56.10]Yes.
[43:01.78]Dishwater soap.
[43:02.60]You guys are going to come up with all these ideas.
[43:03.92]Zombies.
[43:11.99]Yes.
[43:16.41]Wait, why is he, he's got like these like golem, the Cryptkeeper eyes right now.
[43:20.53]Experiments to reduce the cost of breeding.
[43:27.30]We... accidentally... made zombie livestock.
[43:49.71]Get it out, Yakma.
[43:51.41]So the government's now in the zombie-making business.
[43:54.93]The whole story about the drug trade was a cover-up?
[43:57.43]What do you know?
[43:59.01]If I'm, like, dying or turning or if, like, something's happening, I'm going to say everything as fast as I can.
[44:03.63]Because what if you died?
[44:07.79]I would give you as fast, I would say, I would even hurt, I'd scream as loud as I could.
[44:12.53]Do you have any idea how much meat Americans consume in a single day?
[44:30.28]At this point you're acting, you know what I mean?
[44:41.37]You could be like, the research was necessary!
[44:45.85]We had to do it because everyone's eating too much meat, and we're trying to, we just... This show is absolutely necessary.
[44:55.96]No, you would get it out as fast as you could.
[44:57.40]And then you'd be like, the antidote's in the fridge, in the fridge in the upstairs bathroom.
[45:11.15]The fridge in the upstairs bathroom, get the antidote.
[45:13.53]Why do they make it so cryptic?
[45:15.05]The only way you'll ever survive is if you find the cure that I've hidden.
[45:21.69]Just tell them.
[45:22.39]Like, tell them.
[45:23.01]Where is the antidote?
[45:23.99]You know where it is.
[45:24.61]Just say it.
[45:25.29]Just say it to this guy.
[45:26.23]Just say it to his face.
[45:29.65]Just get it out.
[45:30.67]If I'm ever in a position where it's a zombie apocalypse and I know where something is, everyone's going to know.
[45:37.21]That would be bad, though, because then it would be like a huge fight to get to the antidote.
[45:40.91]The people turned into zombies.
[45:46.13]How much antidote... Why do they always make one, like, vial?
[45:48.81]Why don't you make, like, fucking 75 gallons of the antidote?
[45:54.33]Why is it in a vial this big?
[45:57.19]Why am I... Is this, like, my, like, coping mechanism to be like, I'm in the camera?
[46:05.71]Okay.
[46:07.27]That was fucked.
[46:22.49]That had to have gone through my head too.
[46:24.97]The camera's gonna just fall forward and it's gonna be a bullet through my head.
[46:32.34]There's no way that goes straight.
[46:33.96]The lens is an indicator.
[46:39.89]So, the terrorism is a retaliation for a cruel government cover-up.
[46:47.91]sounds plausible or it could be some serious in either case we have to get out of here alive if we want to find out for sure where's my bomb we have to check if she's been bitten let me take a look oh she's been bitten many times I've seen it I've actually seen a medical technician I could be useful if you let me do my job I've watched her get bit like at least a dozen times I know I have no right to ask but please let me help
[47:18.82]If you don't get out of here, the truth dies with you.
[47:30.71]Why is that always the stance when somebody's lying on the ground and sitting on the ground?
[47:34.74]They do this.
[47:35.16]They put their knees up like this and they go like this.
[47:42.87]It's in every game.
[47:44.19]The knees up, legs to the side, and, like, the arm here.
[47:48.13]Where, like... This is not comfortable.
[47:51.27]What do you mean it's comfy?
[47:53.05]No, it's not.
[47:53.87]Sit like that.
[47:55.13]Lean against a wall.
[47:55.85]What do you mean it's... That's not comfortable.
[48:04.33]Why don't you just sit against the wall?
[48:06.65]Like this, or like this.
[48:08.71]With your arms like this.
[48:11.18]fetal position it's like you're about to go to fetal position but you're like stopping halfway for some reason I don't know why the game crashed next case will occur at 11 a.m.
[48:36.35]here we go let's just save it in that same slot right here right in the right here
[48:45.05]Alright.
[48:45.63]Now I get time.
[48:47.17]A strange group.
[48:47.95]I got plenty of time now.
[48:49.39]Timeline secured.
[48:50.27]We're safe.
[48:51.11]Let's go to a strange group.
[48:53.42]It's free roam time.
[49:03.16]What was the intel on this one?
[49:05.11]I need to get food too.
[49:06.07]You're in the worst spot.
[49:14.56]Save?
[49:14.90]I just did.
[49:17.36]The game just saved.
[49:23.53]Oh, I can do the gun shop, too.
[49:25.09]Where is this strange group?
[49:27.93]Remember I walked in the gun shop and there was that weirdo in there?
[49:30.69]I have a shotgun now.
[49:33.63]Maybe I'll do that.
[49:34.19]Alright, here's the plan.
[49:37.54]The plan is to do the skip.
[49:43.29]Where's the strange group?
[49:44.92]I don't know what it said.
[49:46.26]Alright, I'm gonna get the chainsaw.
[49:49.52]And then I'm gonna go up to the gun store.
[49:51.20]And then I'm gonna come back down.
[49:52.08]Uh, give me the sledgehammer.
[50:11.30]Alright.
[50:12.48]So now get chainsaw.
[50:17.26]I need to have this.
[50:18.06]This is important.
[50:19.16]When I don't have the chainsaw, I do not feel safe.
[50:23.22]I got plenty of time.
[50:24.12]I got a lot of time to run around.
[50:25.18]Okay.
[50:25.44]Let's go.
[50:34.61]Oops.
[50:35.73]No!
[50:37.03]You all did the same move at the same time.
[50:42.88]Alright, fuck it.
[50:43.40]Just leave him.
[50:48.24]Oh, that felt good.
[50:51.80]Stringer.
[50:52.84]Check out Dead Rising 2.
[50:53.86]I've actually played Dead Rising 2 in co-op.
[50:56.12]But we didn't make it out of the elevator, I don't think.
[50:58.26]I don't remember playing that game past the elevator.
[51:00.30]Me and Star played it.
[51:03.28]I don't know.
[51:03.94]I have no idea.
[51:04.76]I think we didn't get out of the tutorial room.
[51:07.92]Alright, where am I going now?
[51:08.82]So, Wonderland.
[51:09.52]There's a save point there.
[51:10.85]I could go to the gun store.
[51:13.97]Movie plaza is... What's the actual movie plaza?
[51:20.18]Paradise plaza?
[51:20.76]No plaza?
[51:21.14]Alright.
[51:21.38]I'm going to go up from here.
[51:23.38]I'm going to save it.
[51:24.00]I'm going to go to the gun store.
[51:28.54]I think that's a good idea.
[51:35.18]So it was this way, right?
[51:37.39]Yes.
[51:39.95]Question marks are scoops.
[51:43.47]Oh, fuck.
[51:45.21]Alright, well, that's fine.
[51:46.37]I gotta get guns.
[51:49.07]I don't want handguns.
[51:49.97]I don't want handguns.
[51:51.07]I want guns that can explode things.
[51:53.27]And rifles and shit.
[51:57.41]It won't take long.
[52:04.60]Like, this is not a gun.
[52:06.04]This thing sucks.
[52:09.76]This is fun to shoot, and... Did I pass it?
[52:12.76]I did.
[52:13.18]God damn it.
[52:13.60]This is what happens when I just walk and talk.
[52:26.09]Eat boogers.
[52:26.89]Eat boogers.
[52:30.54]Wait, what the hell am I doing?
[52:33.26]No, no, go back.
[52:33.88]I'm just saving the game in here, not going all the way back.
[52:40.75]You see, I'm like trying to pay... Eat boogers.
[52:44.23]I'm trying to like navigate.
[52:45.45]Imagine you're driving somewhere and like the person in your passenger seat is just going, eat boogers, eat boogers, eat your boogers, eat your boogers.
[52:56.73]You're going to miss your exit.
[53:00.03]All right, it's happening again.
[53:01.15]All right, straight up.
[53:09.03]Just don't read.
[53:12.57]That's true.
[53:12.99]That's a good idea.
[53:13.54]But it's compulsive.
[53:14.76]I have to look over here.
[53:16.00]What did I just do?
[53:19.94]I did not want to pick that guy up in like a fucking scoop slam.
[53:24.46]And now I have no help.
[53:27.05]This is great.
[53:33.65]Is there any... There's a grocery store right here.
[53:36.05]I'm going to hit up the grocery store.
[53:38.19]And then back this way to the gun.
[53:40.70]And then we'll go from there.
[53:47.88]I don't want to use this yet.
[53:50.12]I also want to get a book for this thing.
[53:53.50]For the chainsaw.
[53:54.46]It's the tools book.
[53:56.22]So I got to go to the bookstore too eventually.
[53:58.22]I got time.
[53:58.94]I don't need to rush.
[54:04.39]Pause for the special moves.
[54:06.81]I can't.
[54:07.11]I don't have any time to pause.
[54:11.13]What?
[54:17.15]Yeah.
[54:19.28]I have a motorcycle now.
[54:21.81]Alright, this is important.
[54:23.63]I need to eat a bunch of food and fill up.
[54:28.29]I can ride the motorcycle?
[54:29.23]We're going to get a full letter grade, aren't we?
[54:32.23]Yep, that's right.
[54:32.87]Alright, is there any orange juice?
[54:35.19]Is there better food here?
[54:37.49]Besides just the junk on the shelves?
[54:40.51]I don't want to eat melons.
[54:42.21]I mean, I will, but I don't want to.
[54:45.10]Queen?
[54:45.26]Queen?
[54:46.93]Shit.
[54:47.67]Where?
[54:48.45]Right there.
[55:00.26]Give me the queen!
[55:00.80]Oh god, it's... Are you all just standing on it?
[55:09.04]Where is it?
[55:11.58]Where's my indicator?
[55:13.26]Where's the fucking queen?
[55:19.32]Get it!
[55:21.92]All right.
[55:23.36]Frozen food aisle.
[55:24.32]Pizzas?
[55:26.46]I hear another one.
[55:29.68]I got two queens.
[55:32.06]Can I eat frozen pizza?
[55:35.60]Oh, I can eat uncooked pizza.
[55:40.16]How much does it heal?
[55:41.12]Only two.
[55:41.60]Oh, I'm so sick of you motherfuckers, I swear to God.
[55:47.71]Get the fuck away from me.
[55:52.77]Alright, I'm gonna eat... I'm gonna take... Get rid of this.
[55:59.22]Two uncooked pizzas.
[56:02.30]That should be alright for a little bit.
[56:05.92]Wait, is there wine here?
[56:07.50]Chat, tell him about the wine.
[56:09.72]There's wine?
[56:10.20]There's meat over there, too.
[56:11.94]Don't eat uncooked pizza.
[56:15.60]Where's the wine?
[56:17.59]Dairy?
[56:20.35]Condiments?
[56:22.05]Meats?
[56:24.09]It just triggers an automatic hatred response.
[56:27.85]Back here?
[56:28.23]There it is.
[56:34.15]I don't want to use this, though.
[56:34.89]I don't want to overuse this.
[56:36.75]Oh, fuck.
[56:37.07]There is one back here.
[56:38.19]Holy shit.
[56:38.97]Okay.
[56:46.87]No.
[56:47.15]Get rid of this, too.
[56:53.70]No, turn.
[57:05.45]One, two, three.
[57:07.41]Three wines.
[57:08.75]Three wines, chainsaw, shotgun.
[57:11.17]Two queens.
[57:12.09]Let's go.
[57:14.55]Why am I taking my eyes off the exit?
[57:16.51]I don't know.
[57:18.29]It's like the streamer curse.
[57:21.83]Where I'm just like, alright, I got it.
[57:25.12]It happened in my demonstration!
[57:27.24]Okay, I'm good.
[57:36.63]You hate streaming.
[57:37.55]No, get off!
[57:37.95]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:38.71]I need a save point.
[57:39.77]Can I ride this?
[57:41.41]How do I ride it?
[57:43.53]Okay, it's right trigger.
[57:47.82]This is so fast.
[57:48.94]Alright, hold on.
[57:49.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[57:49.66]Where's the save point?
[57:50.60]Right here.
[57:52.60]I gotta keep this motorcycle.
[57:58.89]No, get off the motorcycle.
[58:01.13]How do I get off?
[58:01.91]Okay.
[58:08.71]Good.
[58:11.27]Now that's in my head.
[58:13.23]Yeah, overwrite saved it.
[58:14.18]Let's go.
[58:21.84]Now we're going to go to the gun shop, which is this way.
[58:25.42]Gun shop.
[58:25.88]So come out here.
[58:27.14]Bang a left.
[58:28.31]Straight down the little narrow hall.
[58:30.17]You got it.
[58:30.55]Okay, down here.
[58:45.51]No.
[58:46.25]Wrong narrow hall.
[58:47.03]A little bit further.
[58:54.27]Where is it?
[58:55.95]Fucking missed it.
[59:14.44]Oh god!
[59:16.45]Hello?
[59:18.59]Woah!
[59:21.49]Hello?
[59:21.85]Woah!
[60:03.24]It's not the same guy in there.
[60:07.95]I took a lot of bullets, though.
[60:11.19]What am I doing?
[60:12.65]Not being able to move because three people are firing hundreds of bullets into my body.
[60:19.39]Why would they do that?
[60:21.09]I'm not going in there.
[60:28.40]I'm not going in here.
[60:32.10]You have to shoot them from outside the store.
[60:33.76]It's impossible.
[60:34.76]Wait, wait, hold on.
[60:37.86]What'd you say?
[60:42.56]It's this one, right?
[60:43.32]Yeah.
[60:49.91]So I'm going to use the shotgun.
[60:52.19]Where's the motorcycle?
[60:56.45]I didn't walk by it, right?
[60:57.79]Where's the motorcycle?
[61:03.69]It drove off.
[61:09.22]Instant fucking anger.
[61:10.38]Every time.
[61:15.68]I don't think I'm going to do this.
[61:34.96]He's going to grab me instantly.
[61:37.52]Okay.
[61:38.60]Here we go.
[61:40.08]Down this way.
[61:42.73]So you tell me I can't go in here.
[61:45.33]Well, there's zombies everywhere.
[61:55.81]What if I have the gun ready?
[61:59.71]Will that make a difference?
[62:02.33]Look at how many people are out here.
[62:04.41]This is, like, fucking ridiculous.
[62:09.45]What?
[62:09.81]These guys aren't affected?
[62:10.89]How you...
[63:02.17]Is that guys?
[63:04.01]What do you mean Alyssa defected?
[63:07.67]She already was defected!
[63:10.97]They were fucking killing me!
[63:17.07]I'm so confused.
[63:18.21]Wait, what do you mean she's friendly?
[63:21.03]What do you mean, wrong one?
[63:24.33]Get me out of the store.
[63:32.03]Out of the store.
[63:32.39]Out of the store.
[63:40.23]No way.
[63:42.27]Not a chance.
[63:48.55]Anyone there?
[63:49.09]He's shooting all those.
[64:07.16]Why can it stun lock?
[64:10.33]What the fuck?
[64:19.33]Hello?
[64:19.49]Hello?
[64:19.67]Anybody in there?
[64:24.55]What?
[64:25.83]What?
[64:26.17]What?
[64:26.27]What?
[64:26.37]What?
[64:26.53]Read this stuff!
[64:49.59]That was inhuman.
[64:53.09]What if I walk away?
[64:54.27]Will he see me and run out?
[64:56.75]Open both doors.
[65:01.15]Okay, I have to do it again.
[65:03.95]I gotta do it again.
[65:07.18]Holy fuck, I just annihilated him.
[65:14.62]What is he doing?
[65:15.08]What are you doing?
[65:16.26]Where's my chainsaw?
[65:16.96]Where's the chainsaw?
[65:39.89]No!
[65:40.37]I need to be behind him!
[65:53.76]What's going on?
[65:56.77]What do you mean he defected?
[65:58.97]Wait, what?!
[66:02.33]Oh, this is.. this sign's gone!
[66:03.71]New sign!
[66:05.15]We need new sign!
[66:34.43]Just kill me so I can do it again.
[66:39.47]Okay, so it's physically impossible to go in the store.
[66:42.65]So, shoot them from the outside until... But I'm gonna run out of ammo.
[66:46.01]This guy just stunlocks me forever.
[66:49.56]They're friendly.
[66:50.74]I walked in and they fucking started shooting at me!
[66:58.72]Go in and go out.
[67:07.02]I scared them?
[67:07.98]What, because I'm holding the fucking chainsaw?
[67:17.02]Kill the crowd outside, that's... Alright, we're going this way.
[67:23.54]No we're not, we're going- yes we are.
[67:34.90]To be fair, you're barefoot and running around with a chainsaw.
[67:40.16]Yeah, but there's zombies everywhere.
[67:41.32]This is not out of the ordinary.
[67:42.48]I missed it.
[67:53.51]Alright, I'm gonna kill the crowd outside.
[67:54.93]I don't want to use all this, though.
[68:01.35]It's the only thing I fucking have.
[68:05.80]Plus it's a gun shop, so I should be okay.
[68:23.14]Usually there's like all the raincoat guys out here.
[68:37.46]Dude, for being shitty zombies, they sure can hold the fuck on.
[68:46.56]Like, they lumber around like they have no idea where they're going, but they have these, like, fucking, like, landscaper hands to just, like, grab onto it.
[69:02.83]Okay.
[69:04.59]I'm gonna go in.
[69:09.88]I have alcohol.
[69:10.78]Go to hell.
[69:12.16]Here he comes.
[69:12.84]Brett, here comes another one.
[69:18.99]Okay.
[69:29.17]Wait!
[69:30.99]You still breathing?
[69:31.76]Anyone there?
[69:37.74]Okay.
[69:41.23]How was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[69:48.07]There's a helicopter coming.
[69:49.07]It'll be here on Friday.
[69:49.81]I thought you might want to ride.
[69:55.28]Where is it supposed to land?
[69:56.28]There's zombies everywhere.
[70:02.83]And a heliport on the roof.
[70:03.97]Just fall away.
[70:07.76]But the security room is sealed tight at dead end.
[70:10.02]I saw it.
[70:10.48]I know what I saw.
[70:11.24]There's a duct on the roof of Paradise Plaza.
[70:14.86]I just gave everybody all the info, huh?
[70:16.69]I guess I would... No.
[70:18.01]I should be doing this.
[70:20.13]Sounds fishy to me.
[70:21.07]Should I be talking to the other people or something and breaking this conversation up?
[70:26.69]Okay, so...
[70:31.87]What?
[70:32.39]What happened?
[70:32.95]What the fuck is going on?
[70:34.12]What do you mean kill it?
[70:38.90]What the fuck was that?
[70:41.78]Not that I trust you completely, man.
[70:43.12]What do you think?
[70:43.58]Why did they stop talking?
[70:46.28]You heard the man.
[70:47.42]Let's firing squad him again.
[70:50.48]Can I talk?
[70:52.58]Go find your duct and take a picture of it with the camera you got.
[70:56.62]Then we can talk.
[71:01.37]Okay.
[71:03.05]What a waste of fucking time.
[71:04.80]I should just, like... Yeah.
[71:14.17]Got one of you, buddy.
[71:17.45]PP sticker.
[71:18.11]I got one.
[71:18.49]Alright, so I have to come back with a photo of the duct.
[71:27.43]This thing's almost empty.
[71:29.75]Well, I have to go back to... We gotta go back to paradise, so I have to leave out here and just go through the plaza.
[71:40.90]Let's see if I have time to do this still.
[71:42.34]I'm just gonna heal.
[71:45.70]Okay.
[71:50.26]I only have the shotgun and one hit left on this.
[71:52.68]I don't even want to use it.
[71:54.76]Just give me a shitty weapon.
[71:56.04]Like something on the ground.
[72:02.50]We're on our way.
[72:04.42]There we go, pull.
[72:12.27]I hear somebody crying.
[72:13.99]Who's crying?
[72:16.27]You hear that?
[72:24.09]In the store?
[72:25.43]The homes?
[72:29.43]Somebody in here?
[72:35.54]I don't... I heard somebody crying.
[72:40.90]Is nobody in here?
[72:41.62]This is like a hardware store though.
[72:47.99]Anybody here?
[72:56.98]What is this thing doing?
[73:08.57]This is a sick fuck.
[73:13.07]I don't think anyone was there.
[73:14.27]Is this a weed whacker?
[73:15.23]What is this?
[73:15.69]An excavator?
[73:16.57]Oh my god.
[73:24.84]Anyone there?
[73:26.16]Hello?
[73:26.66]I wouldn't trust this person.
[73:27.76]Oh shit.
[73:29.68]Hold on.
[73:29.92]There's a photo.
[73:39.14]Oh, that's a horrible photo.
[73:42.09]Let's get a close-up.
[73:52.23]Which is terrible.
[73:52.91]Alright, I don't think there's anything in here for me.
[73:54.41]Anything in the box?
[74:01.69]Well... That's a fire axe.
[74:06.88]That seems pretty great, actually.
[74:08.56]What's in the box over here?
[74:09.50]Gonna make a jump.
[74:13.76]It's actually kind of slow.
[74:31.21]Chainsaw.
[74:32.01]What else?
[74:32.45]There's so much shit in here.
[74:36.36]Dude, you... Oh, the Panzer Maiden had a fucking flypaper!
[74:42.34]You know what?
[74:42.88]All of you fuck off.
[74:43.78]No, it's not even worth it.
[74:44.88]Just do it.
[74:45.20]Just do it.
[74:45.44]I don't care.
[74:45.80]Just do it.
[74:46.18]I'm done.
[74:53.20]What's over here?
[74:57.24]Toolbox.
[74:58.71]I want to get the thing that's up there.
[75:02.17]What the hell is that?
[75:07.17]Japanese radish.
[75:09.19]Why is that up here?
[75:10.07]What is this?
[75:14.52]I can't go in here?
[75:15.92]Why not?
[75:16.20]Okay, that's weird.
[75:23.28]Use the Japanese radish?
[75:24.20]I don't think I can.
[75:26.30]Alright, I gotta get back.
[75:27.04]I'm starting to get to yellow.
[75:29.80]Is there any more axes or something I can grab on the way out?
[75:33.34]I guess I could take... Is it a pickaxe?
[75:36.12]Can I take that?
[75:37.62]No, sledgehammer.
[75:39.30]Oh, what do I want to replace?
[75:42.62]Just get rid of the radish.
[75:43.72]What am I going to use this for?
[75:44.52]I'll take a sledgehammer.
[75:50.82]Okay.
[75:54.30]I'm out.
[76:19.16]I can't take it outside.
[76:26.18]Oh, they're back.
[76:28.88]Uh-oh.
[76:31.28]When was the last time I saved the fucking game?
[76:35.30]Uh-oh.
[76:36.30]They're all the way down there.
[76:37.22]Okay.
[76:37.82]I'm going to Paradise, though.
[76:43.70]I have to go over here.
[76:48.88]God damn it.
[76:50.16]Now I'm gonna have to, like, cross their path.
[76:57.54]They aren't that hard.
[76:59.38]Well, how many shots do I have in my shotgun?
[77:00.70]I don't think I have very many.
[77:04.67]Use the scoot.
[77:07.15]The scoot.
[77:09.79]Can I just sneak up behind him and shoot the guy in the head with a shotgun?
[77:14.13]Would that work?
[77:16.63]I haven't saved in a while.
[77:17.45]I'm not gonna try it.
[77:20.19]I'll come out here after I save.
[77:22.47]I have to make sure I can do that.
[77:29.69]Let's do this first.
[77:30.67]While it's still time to do it.
[77:41.39]Okay.
[77:42.41]So now it's just over here.
[77:44.79]A strange group.
[77:48.71]I think I found them.
[77:56.11]What the fuck was that?
[78:05.80]Get away from me.
[78:06.62]No!
[78:06.94]Get away from me with your explosions!
[78:08.66]Give me that card.
[78:20.71]There's food over here.
[78:21.65]Put that down.
[78:25.34]Hamburgers and shit, right?
[78:26.18]No, it's just condiments.
[78:31.04]Baking ingredients.
[78:31.66]They don't have any food in here.
[78:32.48]How do you not have food in this restaurant?
[78:42.16]Ronald8, that's where we at.
[78:43.24]That's right.
[78:43.62]Okay, let's go.
[78:47.40]Still have a full heal.
[78:48.92]Movie land.
[79:14.59]What's up motherfuckers?
[79:28.87]Say what?
[79:32.65]Save at the bathroom.
[79:35.73]Those who reject salvation embrace ignorance.
[79:47.06]I got a shotgun.
[79:47.62]I'll kill him.
[79:52.98]This boss is really annoying.
[79:54.24]Don't tell me that.
[79:57.00]Don't tell me that I'm gonna go back to where I was saved in the North Plaza.
[80:03.72]Now I...
[80:08.04]shall return your tainted blood to the foul earth that has spawned you.
[80:16.19]Just shotgun.
[80:27.12]I can't climb that.
[80:28.18]I can't climb.
[80:28.68]How can... Why can I not climb that?
[80:33.26]Run, run, run!
[80:35.50]Why is...
[80:47.76]Oh!
[81:24.91]Oh, he baited me.
[81:26.13]Not good, not good, not good.
[81:34.64]I literally can't even fucking move.
[81:42.94]Fucking every boss stunlocks you in this game.
[81:57.23]OH SHIT!
[81:58.67]You motherfucker.
[82:17.49]You motherfucker, do what I'm telling you to do!
[82:27.78]Missed a fucking shot.
[82:33.52]Apparently I double tapped.
[82:34.63]I hit it.
[82:43.19]Remember, every make, make, make... Oh, I'm not even going to complain about it.
[82:54.67]Really?
[82:55.43]You mother- People in fucking multiplayer games don't even do what you just did.
[83:30.74]He jumped... Oh my god, it's so... Jesus Christ!
[83:51.47]So I need to use this on him.
[83:55.59]Does every boss you just kill with the blue chainsaw and just don't even play it normally?
[83:59.83]Thanks for the content.
[84:03.32]Just kill every boss with the blue chainsaw and don't even deal with it.
[84:06.02]Okay, done.
[84:07.96]I'm gonna go just kill him with the blue chainsaw.
[84:10.18]Fuck it.
[84:11.42]Why do anything else?
[84:21.90]Wait, was this before?
[84:24.57]I think I have to do the plaza thing again.
[84:29.94]I think I have to do the gun shop again, don't I?
[84:31.36]Alright, I know what to do there.
[84:40.22]Get a lightsaber?
[84:45.08]In this timeline, did I already do it?
[84:47.82]Just go back with the picture?
[84:48.80]Yeah, that's, you know, good plan.
[84:51.23]I like how you're thinking.
[84:54.23]Good plan.
[84:57.09]Alright, I'm going in at just blue chainsaw, just swinging him five times and win.
[85:17.21]Yeah, I went in the hardware store.
[85:18.59]I got, like, distracted.
[85:19.71]Let's just go.
[85:27.01]I think I should have enough to kill him with this.
[85:35.76]I didn't get a pair of shoes, too.
[85:37.84]I still have shoes on.
[86:01.66]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[86:06.96]Okay.
[86:09.67]Let's go.
[86:10.93]Booby land.
[86:13.33]Save it.
[86:13.81]Over here was the bathroom.
[86:14.67]It's right here, right?
[86:15.71]Literally just walk across, save it in the bathroom.
[86:21.59]Wait, am I going the right way?
[86:22.93]Yes.
[86:25.49]Get a booby land costume.
[86:31.17]I would enable cheats that makes it so you can't be grabbed by zombies.
[86:34.51]And I would not even think twice about enabling it.
[86:38.39]I would just turn it on.
[86:41.23]I don't care.
[86:48.12]There's a drink for that?
[86:49.60]I think there is, you're right.
[86:51.46]Alright, game is saved.
[86:54.12]Don't tell him.
[86:54.82]Look at that alpha nerd neck.
[87:18.76]Well, you made me a Skeksi.
[87:22.48]From... The... The crystal, whatever it is.
[87:26.56]The dead... Whatever that... You know what I'm talking about.
[87:30.86]Okay.
[87:31.65]I am ready.
[87:32.49]I am gonna... Not heal yet, because that takes too much.
[87:35.43]Alright.
[87:39.25]Now I have to heal.
[87:44.23]Oh, it hurts every time.
[87:58.41]Did you seriously just bodyblock me from walking?
[88:00.29]Get the fuck out of here!
[88:01.53]That's what you deserve!
[88:02.89]Alright, I don't need the shop.
[88:10.84]Okay, go to Movie Land and get a costume.
[88:12.68]I'm not going to use the card.
[88:20.45]Use the double lariat skill.
[88:21.77]Okay, this powerful skill costs more than the art judo.
[88:28.86]When grabbed by a zombie, push left stick downward repeatedly to toss the attacker.
[88:32.36]Yes, I've done that a bunch.
[88:33.34]I know that.
[88:36.98]So I get to do a zangief?
[88:40.38]Press and hold left stick and then press X.
[88:51.85]Did I just lose the shotgun?
[89:08.78]I didn't know I was gonna fucking throw the thing.
[89:11.70]Okay.
[89:13.74]Is it gonna be there if I go back?
[89:16.28]No, because there's a cutscene in between.
[89:19.54]I can't even walk up this ramp.
[89:21.24]It doesn't exist.
[89:21.78]Yeah.
[89:32.59]Okay, I'm going to get some refreshments.
[89:34.71]I have plenty of time.
[89:35.49]I know it's over there.
[89:36.17]Ooh, wait a minute.
[89:38.35]Okay.
[89:40.03]Untouchable.
[89:41.87]At least the true power within, no one can touch you.
[89:46.60]So that was a snack.
[89:49.27]What's this one?
[89:50.15]Quick step.
[89:50.67]Alright, we're going to make like a Cheetos smoothie.
[90:03.46]Spitfire.
[90:04.26]What does Spitfire do?
[90:05.10]I don't think I've even used it.
[90:08.50]Okay, wait, wait, hold on.
[90:09.60]I've got to break some stuff.
[90:10.50]There might be food in here.
[90:12.32]There is.
[90:12.76]Okay, there's lettuce.
[90:15.56]And there's another one.
[90:19.74]Lettuce and... A rat stick?
[90:26.64]What the hell is this for?
[90:27.68]I don't have any other food?
[90:32.42]I don't have any other food.
[90:37.01]No can of drinks I can't... Damn it.
[90:39.51]Well, I'm just gonna eat the lettuce.
[90:42.41]The wine?
[90:43.67]Oh, that's right.
[90:44.99]So I do lettuce and wine?
[90:49.20]I'm going to do lettuce and wine.
[90:59.00]And that is... Quick step.
[91:00.76]That's a good one.
[91:01.38]Okay, then I'm going to do... Can I put the queen in there?
[91:09.77]Jeff, five community subs.
[91:10.75]Thank you, Jeff.
[91:15.31]Will that work?
[91:21.09]Well, whatever.
[91:21.51]I got my rat stick.
[91:22.31]I'm ready to go.
[91:23.33]Let's do it.
[91:24.59]I'm gonna save the game right here.
[91:30.32]I'll get in a costume, don't worry.
[91:36.26]Still got plenty of time.
[91:40.11]The stick sucks?
[91:41.59]It's okay.
[91:46.55]I'm assuming the costume is here.
[91:47.65]Can I get shoes on in this place?
[91:50.69]Oh, that's an awesome superhero.
[91:58.57]Am I gonna dress up as Mega Man?
[92:00.34]Is that what you want me to do?
[92:11.06]It's a Nerf gun.
[92:12.19]That's so cool.
[92:23.60]What was that?
[92:26.02]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[92:32.79]Alright, I don't want this thing.
[92:33.51]This thing just shoots Nerf balls.
[92:34.73]Give me my rat stick back.
[92:36.47]Alright, here.
[92:36.87]I got a costume.
[92:37.49]I got the Mega Man helmet.
[92:38.39]It's cool.
[92:42.92]Anything else in any of these other little stores?
[92:44.38]No.
[92:45.22]Let's go.
[92:57.55]I have to bake it through, and I'm gonna go like this, and let's go!
[93:03.45]Do the Lariat!
[93:05.17]Do the Lariat!
[93:05.82]Do the Lariat!
[93:07.04]Hold, left stick, Lariat!
[93:32.90]They were nice enough to leave the Mega Man helmet on.
[93:39.06]So you have to be standing still for that to work.
[93:55.07]Just fucking kill me.
[94:04.32]They're surprisingly calm.
[94:08.30]Now I wish I had the shopping cart.
[94:12.48]Because that's going to be a pain in the ass.
[94:24.41]I know, I know.
[94:25.15]I'm going to get it.
[94:26.15]I know.
[94:26.49]I know.
[94:29.82]Get the rat suit.
[94:30.94]There is no rat suit.
[94:35.04]Okay, um, I don't want to use this.
[94:36.72]I'm going to try to just use the stick.
[94:39.64]I'm just going to try to jump through.
[94:43.52]Holy shit, this thing sucks.
[94:45.79]Did it again.
[94:46.29]They did it again.
[94:46.87]They got me again with the fucking spray.
[94:49.33]They just spray.
[94:49.99]They just all... Yeah, I have to... What?
[94:53.35]Did I get the question wrong?
[94:54.77]Sorry!
[94:58.66]You didn't do it right.
[94:59.74]That's your guy's button.
[95:01.70]Now he didn't do that right.
[95:11.59]I have to get the cart and just run through it.
[95:14.53]You know I'm not going down with a fucking fight.
[95:26.09]I'm curious, George.
[95:28.61]Man in the yellow-red hat.
[95:30.75]Whatever the fucking thing is.
[95:41.54]Yellow-red McDonald's.
[95:42.74]Maybe I'm hungry.
[95:43.46]Maybe I should get some McDonald's.
[95:45.68]Alright, I'm gonna get the cart.
[95:46.74]I'm gonna run through.
[95:47.64]And then I'm gonna kill the guy with the sword.
[95:50.44]Sounds like a plan, Jeremy.
[95:51.72]I think you should do it.
[95:53.28]That sounds like something you should do.
[96:01.65]Do a McDonald's review stream part 2.
[96:05.02]It's not very good.
[96:06.74]But I still eat it.
[96:14.62]Holy shit, this thing does suck.
[96:16.45]You guys were right.
[96:18.17]It's awful.
[96:25.07]Alright.
[96:26.19]Go.
[96:26.43]Go.
[96:28.56]What did I do wrong?
[96:30.31]What did I do wrong?
[96:31.69]I did that right.
[96:33.81]How was that incorrect?
[96:46.45]What theater is it?
[96:47.55]What theater is it?
[96:48.15]Which theater is it?
[96:53.53]Let's go!
[97:16.94]Don't get cocky.
[97:17.84]It's just like fucking that game that I reference every other... I thought that was a person.
[97:24.87]Give me strength.
[97:41.56]I beseech

[98:18.46]Don't let him spread out.
[98:19.56]Don't spread out.
[98:26.98]Do I have any grenades?
[98:30.78]I'm gonna save the people, but I need... This is bad.
[98:36.97]He's gonna explode.

[100:16.41]No.
[100:18.05]No, give that to Beth.
[100:18.97]Is there any other weapons in here?
[100:20.85]Alright, let's go.
[100:25.35]Close the door.
[100:28.01]What's wrong with the door?
[100:28.85]I need to save the game.
[100:29.87]Hold on.
[100:32.35]We go out here, down out of movie land.
[100:35.38]Save game.
[100:37.24]And then we're right there.
[100:39.26]Other door, other door, other door.
[100:46.80]This door?
[100:53.05]What's in this door?
[101:03.67]Hey!
[101:08.09]Please, they're going to kill me.
[101:10.53]They want to sacrifice me.
[101:11.45]I'll do anything.
[101:11.93]Just save me.
[101:12.37]Okay.
[101:14.31]Let's go.
[101:17.33]First of all, I need to open this box first.
[101:21.98]Somebody take this.
[101:23.56]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[101:24.60]Is there any more stuff at this propane tank?
[101:26.12]Has everybody picked that up?
[101:27.84]Somebody take this.
[101:31.03]Okay, sounds fun.
[101:32.31]I took care of those goons.
[101:33.39]You're safe now.
[101:34.25]You did?
[101:34.65]Really?
[101:40.68]Come on, that's like drama going on back there.
[101:42.56]I can't, no wasting time.
[101:48.70]Here we go, again.
[101:49.42]Another one of these stupid... Okay.
[101:56.44]Everybody go over here.
[102:00.97]How many do I have?
[102:01.53]One, two, three, four.
[102:04.39]Where is she?
[102:04.91]Let's go!
[102:07.33]Their leader's finished, though there may be a few underlings left.
[102:11.07]This place is dangerous.
[102:11.73]You ready to blow this joint?
[102:14.20]Thanks, I'll follow you anywhere.
[102:16.20]Alright, we gotta go now.
[102:17.20]Let's go.
[102:21.08]Alright, just stay with me.
[102:24.14]I only have... I do have a bug.
[102:31.24]I got bugs.
[102:33.14]You got a gun?
[102:34.29]Good.
[102:35.71]Who wants the gun?
[102:39.21]Michelle.
[102:43.65]Who wants the gun?
[102:44.37]Who should have the gun?
[102:46.19]Oh, I don't know.
[102:46.85]Nathan, absolutely not you.
[102:49.38]Ray's got a chainsaw.
[102:50.10]Beth.
[102:51.36]Cheryl.
[102:53.42]Beth.
[102:56.64]She understands.
[102:59.61]No, I don't trust Nathan with anything.
[103:02.65]Let's go.
[103:08.39]I'm sorry.
[103:09.17]A horror movie, like Fat Guy with a Mustache is always the one that does something crazy and gets the whole thing fucked up.
[103:14.23]What are you talking about?
[103:15.11]I unlocked the door to get the soup from inside the storeroom.
[103:19.01]And it's like, Nathan, what the fuck are you thinking, man?
[103:22.71]Oh, it must have been me when I came back.
[103:25.33]No.
[103:31.60]Here, take this.
[103:37.86]Alright, now we gotta go out here, watch it.
[103:44.00]Except for Ronald.
[103:44.72]Ronald ate all the food.
[103:45.66]That is an absolute fat guy with a mustache thing to do.
[103:48.50]What are you talking about?
[103:51.17]Got everybody?
[103:59.71]Alright, we just have to go here.
[104:03.79]That's it.
[104:08.13]You ready?
[104:09.36]Follow me.
[104:15.08]Slow.
[104:15.42]We don't have to go far.
[104:27.27]Everyone's good.
[104:34.09]Nice swinging.
[104:37.30]And I have bees.
[104:38.22]Nice.
[104:44.54]In fact, I'm going to use a B up here.
[104:49.91]Everyone good?
[104:50.89]Watch out behind you.
[104:51.53]Behind you!
[104:53.39]Let's move.
[104:58.65]Keep going.
[105:01.88]Somebody else want a gun?
[105:02.62]Alright, somebody else get a gun.
[105:08.14]Handgun.
[105:09.63]You!
[105:10.01]Who doesn't have a handgun?
[105:11.75]Nathan, take the gun!
[105:13.15]Nathan!
[105:13.79]Nathan, take the gun!
[105:16.03]Nathan!
[105:20.25]Nathan, take a gun!
[105:21.67]Nathan, take a gun!
[105:23.35]Nathan, take the gun!
[105:24.55]Nathan, take a gun!
[105:26.71]Nathan, take a gun!
[105:28.05]Nathan, take the gun!
[105:32.71]I need my sword.
[105:36.29]Where's my sword?
[105:36.93]Nathan, take a gun!
[105:39.48]Why can I not highlight Nathan's name?
[105:41.56]There's too many people.
[105:44.54]Who fucking cares?
[105:45.20]Let's go.
[105:45.72]Out, out, out, out, out.
[105:53.77]Let's go.
[105:55.01]Out.
[106:01.42]Just fuck him.
[106:01.94]Who cares?
[106:02.60]He'll figure it out.
[106:18.86]Straight here.
[106:21.05]Nathan is the thing.
[106:21.89]We're gonna have to test his blood.
[106:27.03]We're safe.
[106:27.79]Through the water.
[106:28.35]Come on.
[106:29.81]Then up here.
[106:34.98]Make it.
[106:36.48]Cheryl.
[106:37.48]Cheryl.
[106:38.00]Cheryl.
[106:38.38]Cheryl.
[106:39.82]Cheryl.
[106:48.87]You're doing great.
[106:49.41]You're doing great.
[106:55.10]Cheryl.
[106:55.50]I don't have time for this.
[106:56.66]Cheryl.
[106:57.32]Cheryl, please.
[106:58.38]Cheryl.
[107:10.11]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[107:18.10]Oh, just... Michelle, stop getting in the fucking way.
[107:40.11]Michelle's gonna detect if I hit her again.
[107:41.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we're good.
[107:47.11]Got everybody?
[107:47.63]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[107:49.43]Follow me.
[107:53.53]Follow me!
[107:53.99]Follow me!
[108:02.45]Alright, I'm running out of juice here.
[108:04.05]Follow me!
[108:09.19]We're all here.
[108:09.71]Go.
[108:10.39]Come on!
[108:12.39]Follow me!
[108:19.91]I need the sword.
[108:21.53]For the elevator.
[108:36.68]We good?
[108:38.60]This sounds like a lot of people in there.
[108:40.06]One, two, three, four, five.
[108:42.34]Here we go.
[108:49.72]Help, help me.
[108:50.46]Help, help.
[108:51.02]Somebody help.
[108:57.73]Got them all.
[109:04.63]And we still have some time left, too.
[109:07.99]All five of you, get up here.
[109:12.41]Take a picture.
[109:26.06]Good photo.
[109:30.57]Cheryl Jones.
[109:32.41]I'm all dusty.
[109:33.09]What I wouldn't get for a shower.
[109:34.27]I'm gonna get a lot for this.
[109:39.83]Oh, yeah.
[109:40.73]250,000 PP.
[109:41.44]That's pretty good.
[109:44.04]New skill.
[109:44.52]We might have to take a look at it.
[109:46.89]Level up again.
[109:47.79]Life up.
[109:48.37]Nice.
[109:49.49]Knee drop.
[109:52.05]More stock.
[109:53.29]Oh, yes.
[109:54.03]Perfect.
[109:54.33]Okay, I need to save.
[109:59.70]For a second, I forgot that happened.
[110:02.62]Alright, save the game, and then I'm gonna pee my pants.
[110:05.36]It's been two hours.
[110:06.38]Every two hours into a stream, I have to pee really badly, and then I'm fine for, like, the rest of the day.
[110:10.67]Just happens to be at, like, 4 or 5 p.m.
[110:13.19]every day.
[110:17.88]Picture of the vent.
[110:19.27]Oh, that's right.
[110:19.75]You're right.
[110:20.03]All right.
[110:22.32]I'll be right back.
[113:24.42]Alright, let's keep going.
[113:33.21]Hello.
[113:36.10]I'm back.
[113:42.44]Ready to go?
[113:45.06]So what was the last thing I did?
[113:46.89]Just leave it to me.
[113:49.32]This is getting kind of crowded in here.
[113:50.56]Is this when everybody does their pre-programmed sim animation?
[114:03.11]I need to get everybody in the same picture.
[114:04.49]386p, that's not bad.
[114:18.68]Alright, picture of the duct.
[114:19.52]And is there anything else going on?
[114:21.52]Oh, shit.
[114:22.02]I can still do this.
[114:22.96]I can still do this, right?
[114:23.80]I just gotta go up there.
[114:26.26]Alright, the game is saved, right?
[114:27.21]I saved it?
[114:27.67]Did I?
[114:28.07]Yes, I did.
[114:30.03]Alright, let's get a picture of the duct.
[114:32.87]Does that count?
[114:39.37]I got this guy.
[114:40.17]I got this guy, Otis, up there.
[114:41.87]You're gonna love him.
[114:54.01]Air duct.
[114:57.71]Okay, let's go.
[114:59.43]I can still do the photographer.
[115:00.55]I gotta save this one too so it doesn't get deleted.
[115:03.79]Can you guys hear me?
[115:07.15]I need to save them both just in case there's a problem.
[115:12.56]We still have the other ones all saved.
[115:18.20]Check the new move.
[115:19.06]That's a very good idea.
[115:24.07]Okay, roundhouse kick.
[115:25.63]Unleash a powerful kick just as you land with this skill.
[115:27.91]Press X at the exact moment you contact the ground following a jump or drop from a high plane.
[115:43.41]Nice.
[115:45.77]Okay, that's not it.
[115:46.79]There it is.
[115:52.55]Cool.
[115:52.65]All right.
[116:02.08]I'm out of stuff.
[116:03.18]I need to... Oh, the torso!
[116:05.74]Right?
[116:07.38]Torso is the best item in the whole game.
[116:09.44]Remember everyone was telling me to use it?
[116:14.17]Let's see.
[116:14.53]Let's test it.
[116:15.35]Let's test the theory.
[116:17.95]Torso.
[116:20.67]I'm willing to give it a try.
[116:25.79]Spotted a guy with long hair over in one of the women's clothing shops in Wonderland Plaza.
[116:29.04]Okay, I don't think I'm going to have time to do it.
[116:31.90]Sold a Molotov Cocktail.
[116:35.14]What?
[116:35.42]Okay.
[116:35.68]Long-haired punk is actually... There's plenty of time for it.
[116:40.04]This thing actually is pretty good.
[116:41.08]So, I got a lot of time to do that.
[116:49.54]Let's do the photographer's pride first.
[116:52.46]And then I have to make sure I'm back for the... I gotta make sure I'm back for the actual story mission.
[117:04.85]Try to do the kick.
[117:06.65]I'm holding... Alright, up here.
[117:07.55]Alright, what is this part?
[117:11.43]Let me... Uh-oh.
[117:12.61]I'm gonna have to go back.
[117:14.56]Um... Alright, Otis, what is it?
[117:21.64]Don't forget the gun shop.
[117:22.76]Yeah, I'm gonna have to do that at the next story cycle, I think.
[117:27.78]Photographer's Pride.
[117:29.94]So, is it not available yet?
[117:31.79]What time does it happen?
[117:35.84]Sick man.
[117:40.09]What was the actual time?
[117:42.87]Noon?
[117:45.13]Oh, shit.
[117:46.27]So... But this one has... This one's gonna happen first.
[117:55.49]Um... Read... Crank, stop it.
[117:57.05]I'm gonna make some smoothies while I'm here.
[118:03.18]Double pie.
[118:03.70]Okay.
[118:10.58]Pie smoothie.
[118:17.70]Pop.
[118:21.00]Untouchable, that's the one I wanted.
[118:23.58]Any more food I can use?
[118:27.02]Something else on the ground, anything?
[118:28.58]Soda?
[118:30.54]No, I'm just gonna eat the pie.
[118:34.07]Okay.
[118:37.61]This thing, what does this book do?
[118:40.93]Alright, I have to keep this as long as I can.
[118:42.80]I wish I could... Can I make my inventory less cluttered?
[118:52.93]What's my favorite pie?
[118:54.01]Banana cream pie is the best pie.
[118:55.99]Without a doubt.
[118:56.41]It's actually the only pie I think I would eat.
[118:58.79]I don't like apple pie.
[118:59.73]I don't like blueberry pie.
[119:00.99]Any fruit-based pies that's not a banana, I don't find appetizing at all.
[119:06.97]Banana cream pie is alright, but, I mean, uh, that's what I just said.
[119:10.86]Chocolate cream pie is pretty good.
[119:13.60]But if it's not banana cream pie, I don't want to eat it.
[119:16.04]I don't want it.
[119:18.20]Um, do I have enough time to do any of these other things?
[119:22.10]I don't think so.
[119:23.66]I'm gonna miss this ship.
[119:30.31]Where was the sick man?
[119:34.98]I have the vent picture.
[119:36.06]Yeah, but I have to go all... How much time do I actually have to get back for the story mission?
[119:43.39]I could go in the skip and appear over here.
[119:48.73]I start here and then go down.
[119:50.33]Is there enough time to do it?
[119:59.30]Vent picture?
[119:59.88]No, I have the vent picture.
[120:03.67]I just don't have a scenario where I get locked in and I do this mission and I can't get back in enough time to do the actual case mission.
[120:14.65]I'll save it and try it.
[120:15.37]We'll see what happens.
[120:15.97]I'll make sure I have a don't softlock me please scenario.
[120:20.97]Alright, so I gotta go this way.
[120:30.02]I still have a gun.
[120:34.45]How did that guy even grab me?
[120:38.29]They just, like, magnetize to your fucking body.
[120:41.55]And it's making me upset.
[120:42.42]Alright, I think that... Let's make a... Scenario that is... No, I can't fail.
[120:53.50]Which is right here.
[120:56.32]So this save, no matter what, is like the...
[121:00.09]You know in the time travel movie where you find that one spot that you can go back to and stop everything that ever happened?
[121:05.61]That's this point right here.
[121:07.23]So now I have to actually use this teleport.
[121:15.91]Let's see what we can do.
[121:16.63]Alright.
[121:21.25]Sick man.
[121:24.37]Get the chainsaw.
[121:29.71]Chainsaw's a must.
[121:31.55]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[121:40.12]Wait.
[121:41.14]Somebody in here, too?
[121:44.18]Susan.
[121:44.98]Oh, shit.
[121:45.70]Susan, really?
[121:48.76]Uh... Susan, you're gonna have to wait.
[121:55.87]You're gonna have to wait.
[121:56.55]Get shoes!
[121:57.13]Alright, I'm gonna go into Shoes of a Lifetime and I'm gonna get a pair of shoes.
[122:05.29]Can I not wear any of these?
[122:09.51]How can you have a store named Shoes of a Lifetime and not have me able to have a pair of shoes from here?
[122:22.82]Alright, Susan.
[122:23.80]I'm coming.
[122:29.23]You don't want to eat me between my hip and my dentures.
[122:31.45]I'm half plastic and she's no lady.
[122:32.89]He's trying to jump on his head.
[122:39.54]Alright, Susan.
[122:45.10]Look what I just did for you.
[122:46.00]Alright, let's go.
[122:54.63]Come on, ma'am.
[122:55.15]Follow me.
[122:56.74]You'll be my personal escort.
[122:57.96]What a polite boy.
[122:58.96]Yes, we have to go upstairs first though.
[123:02.36]Susan Walsh has joined.
[123:03.38]Alright, come with me.
[123:04.83]What the hell are you doing?
[123:09.47]Alright, we have to make a quick pit stop.
[123:17.00]Over here?
[123:22.48]What happened to a sick man?
[123:28.46]What's wrong with Leeroy?
[123:32.10]It's too dangerous to be out here.
[123:35.87]Hey, hey, you startled me.
[123:36.71]Don't do that.
[123:40.87]Okay, well... You look a little sick.
[123:49.97]You feeling alright?
[123:51.87]I'm fine.
[123:52.33]Just a scratch.
[123:52.97]No problem.
[123:53.41]He's been bit.
[123:53.81]He's gonna turn.
[123:55.73]You're hurt.
[123:56.31]Wear.
[123:56.67]Show me.
[124:02.62]Don't mind me, guys!
[124:05.26]Don't mind me, I'm just... I'm just... having... Leeroy has joined your group.
[124:17.69]I have to heal.
[124:21.32]Wait, what's this?
[124:26.51]All I did was change my hair to red.
[124:29.75]Granny can't use anything, but Leeroy, take a knife.
[124:33.95]Granny, you're not going to take a gun?
[124:37.68]Carlito, now I'm going to hurt you.
[124:38.96]I have to get back.
[124:42.98]We have to go now.
[124:46.60]Come on.
[124:47.58]Susan, I kept a... Can I just pick you up?
[124:54.41]Yeah, I gotta go.
[125:00.04]Uh, I need to go through the skip.
[125:01.51]The bathroom skip back to paradise.
[125:03.81]Which is up here.
[125:07.75]Chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw.
[125:08.79]Alright, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw.
[125:10.67]Alright, you guys just have to stay somewhere.
[125:15.49]Susan, if you die, you die.
[125:17.64]I'm sorry, I don't have time to do anything about this.
[125:19.88]Just go, like, over here.
[125:21.44]And just stay there for a minute.
[125:22.52]I'll be right back.
[125:23.12]Nice.
[125:24.16]You have... Leroy has a knife.
[125:39.83]Leeroy, come on!
[125:41.23]Just... Alright.
[125:44.44]Stay alive, Leeroy!
[125:46.00]Ooh, that was his broken jaw.
[125:48.98]Alright.
[125:49.54]Stay.
[125:50.46]Here.
[125:56.29]And thanks for stabbing me right in the fucking back.
[125:59.61]Quick step!
[126:15.30]I'm back!
[126:15.64]Let's go!
[126:23.90]Come on!
[126:26.95]Bathroom.
[126:28.59]Up here.
[126:29.17]Bathroom.
[126:31.21]Running out of time.
[126:32.07]Running out of time.
[126:32.65]Running out of time.
[126:38.49]Come on, Susan!
[126:40.69]Susan!
[126:41.11]I have to hold hands.
[126:42.49]You're way too slow.
[126:43.09]Let's go.
[126:45.66]Am I going the right way again?
[126:47.10]Yes.
[126:51.69]Leeroy can fend for himself.
[126:59.79]Come on, Leeroy.
[127:03.22]She's infected.
[127:06.40]Why would you let go of my hand?
[127:10.78]Shoes are gonna have to be for another time.
[127:16.45]It looks like he's running around in circles.
[127:17.65]Does he know where he's going?
[127:23.56]We're in.
[127:23.86]Alright, let's go.
[127:28.58]Alright, now this is a different timeline.
[127:31.04]So that's the one that's safe.
[127:32.52]We're gonna go one up from that.
[127:33.92]This one is just in case something horrible happens.
[127:38.90]Alright, follow me.
[127:42.96]I gotta hold the hand, but it's alright.
[127:49.36]Come on, out of the bathroom.
[127:57.12]I don't know what just happened.
[128:02.43]Why do I have to hold your hand to get out of here?
[128:05.75]Are you this stupid?
[128:09.07]Basic human survival instincts.
[128:12.05]But just... I'm about to literally pick her up and just throw her.
[128:23.14]Susan, you're really making me very annoyed here.
[128:26.26]Give me the fucking chainsaw.
[128:32.35]This is a joke.
[128:38.29]Go!
[128:40.13]Oh my god.
[128:52.77]Straight down.
[128:54.35]He hates the elderly.
[128:56.79]Her AI just keeps breaking like that!
[128:59.87]Just stay with me!
[129:00.79]I lost Leroy.
[129:11.46]Leroy, you're the huge guy with a weapon.
[129:15.02]How could you possibly let this happen?
[129:18.84]Oh my god, you're dumb.
[129:23.05]Holy shit, people.
[129:27.79]Is everybody in this game on drugs?
[129:36.19]Yes.
[129:37.55]It has to be something like that.
[129:41.07]They're all just like... What are you doing?
[129:48.21]Move!
[129:53.12]And then you give them a weapon and they go... And they swing wildly and hit everybody in the group in the face.
[130:03.67]I'm not gonna hold your hand anymore.
[130:05.03]If you die, you die.

[134:32.12]Just wanted to... You know, you could have just said thank you.
[134:40.02]You don't have to stare at me and follow me around.
[134:42.76]Okay.
[134:47.79]A simple thanks would have been nice through the window.
[135:03.75]Don't lose the gun.
[135:05.39]Who cares?
[135:05.79]It's fine bullets.
[135:08.84]Saved?

[135:19.22]Mannequin torso.
[135:19.76]It's too late.
[135:21.48]It's too late.
[135:24.22]It's too late.
[135:25.77]I can't go back.
[135:30.48]Listen, Mr. West, I owe you an apology.
[135:34.34]It looks like you're a pro after all.
[135:36.38]You know, if I would have known that, I'd have taken pictures like this from the start.
[135:49.61]Is that him?
[135:50.57]How'd you like them apples, huh?
[135:53.11]You see, I think outside the box.
[135:58.67]And the best part is...
[136:02.36]That look on your face, wow.
[136:09.23]You got a better laugh than the clown.
[136:30.68]What the hell is going on here?
[136:32.53]I hate this guy.
[136:33.27]Hey!
[136:58.30]I don't have anything?
[136:59.46]Can I take a- Wait, can I take a- He's kicking the shit out of me!
[137:02.82]I didn't even get a- I didn't even get a chance to do anything!
[137:08.57]Um, was your plan to take a photo, or was your plan to tie me up, chain my neck to a pole, and beat me to death?
[137:19.05]That wasn't part of what I- I thought I- What photo did you take?
[137:26.17]Alright.
[137:33.53]This'll take me straight to the top, and then he got like way too into it and fucking murdered me.
[137:36.99]Like, what are you doing?
[137:40.57]Like, relax.
[137:41.92]Easy, psycho.
[137:57.79]What are you all doing in the elevator?
[138:00.63]You all have to... somebody has to press the elevator button and you have to get in.
[138:07.68]Who's putting you in... why are you all getting inside the elevator?
[138:15.72]I got no fucking idea.
[138:23.29]And it's full of people every time.
[138:30.67]Alright, so what actually happens here?
[138:33.94]Is this something I... Can I just not do this?
[138:39.68]Because I got... The photographer's pride is just... Let me do this again.
[138:43.92]I'm just curious as to what... So I'm just here.
[138:50.44]Why did it just... It automatically started last time.
[139:01.96]The story mission is timed.
[139:03.38]I'm gonna get softlocked.
[139:08.72]I still have time for it, though, but what... How do you complete this?
[139:17.06]I got that saved.
[139:17.76]I'll be okay.
[139:18.04]Alright, yep.
[139:23.47]What?
[139:23.93]What?
[139:33.26]I'm gonna capture, on film, the exact moment that a human being crosses into zombiehood.
[139:41.32]You were here, so it's not late.
[139:47.22]What are you doing?
[139:49.02]My shot!
[139:52.75]You ruined my perfect shot!
[139:54.19]So he's gonna do it anyways.
[139:55.11]I'm gonna get tell-tale'd.
[140:06.18]If I'm tied up to a pole, I... Alright, listen, motherfucker.
[140:28.78]No, don't take a photo of him.
[140:29.90]Don't die here.
[140:41.02]I get his camera.
[140:43.06]It's got an achievement that says, Peacekeeper.
[141:02.37]Ooh, a book.
[141:03.37]Camera 2.
[141:06.03]Get a 100% bonus to PP resulting from photos.
[141:15.99]Okay.
[141:16.95]Now, you.
[141:18.62]Trad.
[141:19.98]Oh, Tad.
[141:22.62]You want to come do a mission with me?
[141:23.72]What's up with that freak?
[141:27.56]We have plenty of time to get pissed later.
[141:31.00]We don't have time to stick around and get chatting.
[141:32.32]So let's go.
[141:33.28]You and me.
[141:33.64]You're coming with me.
[141:37.17]It's a safe place that you will not be seeing.
[141:41.33]Yeah, I hate this place now.
[141:42.33]Okay, Tad.
[141:43.55]Tad, you are now... You are party member from Star Trek.
[141:48.63]Every episode.
[141:50.87]You're just the guy that is just there.
[141:53.05]And I'm sorry I'm not going to save you, but you will not be completely conformed.
[142:03.06]Alright, where do I go?
[142:09.44]Let's see.
[142:09.92]Where is this actually taking place?
[142:11.84]Wonderland Park!
[142:12.92]So, wait, no.
[142:13.90]Down to the entrance plaza.
[142:16.06]Is there a quick way to get to the entrance plaza?
[142:18.02]I guess just walk down.
[142:23.09]Save him.
[142:26.99]You took the longest way around just saying red shirt.
[142:34.87]Yeah, well, I mean, come on.
[142:41.07]I'm gonna get soft.
[142:41.75]This is the wrong way.
[142:42.41]What do you mean wrong way?
[142:44.18]Wrong way.
[142:44.98]That's not... It's not the entrance closet one?
[142:51.88]It's not this one here?
[142:55.67]I thought this is the... That's the... The long hair guy, right?
[143:02.25]It's in the... It's in the park.
[143:13.33]Really?
[143:17.19]I thought it was that, um, that scoop down there.
[143:20.09]Gonna get the Tad ending.
[143:23.13]Who knows?
[143:23.49]He might live long enough to do this whole thing with me.
[143:26.28]In that case, you know, good for him.
[143:34.76]So then... Why am I going through here?
[143:46.16]Why wouldn't I have just done, like, the shortcut?
[143:48.50]Or is this a different spot to go?
[144:01.84]You have to get into the tunnel.
[144:03.30]Oh, okay.
[144:06.49]Oh, down there.
[144:07.15]I see what you mean.
[144:08.09]Come on, Tad.
[144:08.57]You can run faster than that.
[144:13.23]I see what you're saying.
[144:14.41]Well, I have two full heals.
[144:17.24]And I have two torsos.
[144:24.22]Come on, let's go!
[144:25.06]Spin him around.
[144:32.51]With a little bit of hustle, please, Tat.
[144:35.91]Shoot her!
[144:37.49]He just aimed just until she was on the ground.
[144:40.45]Shoot her, Tat.
[144:57.69]Go.
[144:59.66]That way.
[145:00.30]Hurry up.
[145:09.01]Almost there.
[145:15.59]Keep with me.
[145:16.09]Stay with me.
[145:16.55]To the right.
[145:17.41]Right side.
[145:18.22]You got it.
[145:18.68]You know what you're doing.
[145:21.09]Don't be like the others.
[145:23.03]Tom.
[145:23.85]Tad.
[145:24.59]Tad.
[145:26.03]Tad.
[145:26.49]Is this short for something?
[145:36.54]Tad pull.
[145:42.19]I don't know why, but I feel like that's accurate.
[145:44.53]Tad, are you ready to get in the car, Tad?
[145:48.58]Oh, Tad, we gotta cruise.
[145:50.64]Come on, Tad, let's go!
[145:55.84]Tad, crank some tunes if you want.
[146:00.73]Just me and Tad having some fun.
[146:05.03]Time until helicopter- alright, Tad.
[146:11.69]I can't drive through this?
[146:14.88]Why would I have a car?
[146:20.45]Are you serious?
[146:21.55]I need to get the motorcycle.
[146:27.41]God damn it, Tad.
[146:29.09]Why didn't you say something?
[146:37.86]Get out, Tad.
[146:39.70]Let's go.
[146:40.32]On the bike.
[146:40.76]You and me.
[146:46.04]Tad!
[146:49.32]Oh, you are all so dumb!
[146:51.69]How many drugs did you take out of the glove box?
[146:57.31]Oh!
[147:02.98]Get on!
[147:17.40]He's dead.
[147:17.86]Fuck him.
[147:18.60]Anyone there?
[147:29.40]Am I going the right way?
[147:30.22]Ah.
[147:38.93]I don't know.
[147:42.47]Is this correct?
[147:49.71]I don't think this is correct.
[147:56.43]It's here.
[147:57.92]Why'd he stop doing that?
[148:02.44]Just zoom it out!
[148:03.22]Okay, so... It's down here.
[148:07.36]So, out, right, right.
[148:11.68]Go back for tat.
[148:14.13]He'll find his own way.
[148:18.69]I can't believe we couldn't take the car.
[148:20.01]I couldn't take... me and Tad couldn't do that.
[148:21.71]Right?
[148:22.91]Or right?
[148:28.87]And then... bang a left?
[148:32.32]Ah, it doesn't matter.
[148:33.00]Just right again.
[148:36.20]Save Tad or right.
[148:37.36]He'll... maybe he'll still be around.
[148:39.22]It's possible.
[148:41.66]Why is this long-haired tunk thing selected?
[148:44.76]I didn't do that.
[148:52.40]Bang left, and then I'm there.
[148:57.76]The bike is not going to explode, right?
[148:59.01]Alright, is it in this building?
[149:09.55]It's right there.
[149:10.63]Why is it selected?
[149:11.71]It was on Bomb Collector.
[149:17.09]I didn't change it.
[149:17.79]I didn't put my watch up.
[149:24.37]Can I go in there with the bike?
[149:27.73]I'm going to try.
[149:44.58]Anyone there?
[149:46.60]You think I'm going to lose this shit?
[149:48.66]Not happening.
[149:54.68]Never mind.
[149:55.00]Alright, now where the hell am I going?
[150:03.27]There are five bombs?
[150:07.31]What do you mean five bombs?
[150:09.17]Todd... Todd Hothworth is dead.
[150:14.88]I don't... Well, now I know what you guys mean by it's time.
[150:22.70]Bomb.
[150:25.58]You obtained a Time Bomb.
[150:27.04]This is for... Can I drive this?
[150:43.17]I get it.
[150:54.20]Okay.
[150:58.11]Motorcycle back.
[151:00.70]What?
[151:05.42]What the hell are you doing here?
[151:12.64]I'm not gonna be able to do this?
[151:16.29]He just drives a car?
[151:20.95]What?
[151:25.63]I have to reload it.
[151:30.91]That was my only means of transportation, you dick!
[151:35.04]Okay, so... Holy shit.
[152:01.79]Alright, photographer is done.
[152:07.43]But, I kind of don't care.
[152:09.75]You know what I'm saying?
[152:15.57]I got, like, I'm just gonna go.
[152:17.21]I do.
[152:22.29]Well, if I, that seems like a long mission.
[152:25.42]You know what I'm saying?
[152:28.46]That seems kind of like a long thing to do, you know what I'm saying?
[152:42.13]Just once I want to open that up.
[152:45.04]And there's nothing in there.
[152:46.60]Just once.
[152:47.14]I just want to, just one time.
[152:48.28]I want to open the elevator.
[152:49.20]There's nothing in it.
[152:52.00]It takes two seconds.
[152:54.81]Alright, okay.
[152:55.51]I'll get Tad.
[152:56.27]And then he's dead anyways.
[152:58.15]Like, what do you want me to do?
[153:01.51]I can't bring him with me and I can't return him.
[153:15.16]Save him.
[153:15.72]I can't save him!
[153:21.22]How can these zombies have a, like, 88% grab rate?
[153:27.73]Bring him home.
[153:29.93]Fine.
[153:33.23]Fine.
[153:36.19]I'll save Tad.
[153:37.33]And I'll bring him back.
[153:39.15]Fine.
[153:44.53]Okay.
[153:49.28]I'm gonna do it.
[154:02.25]He's a kicker right in the groin.
[154:09.69]Time to do a flashy end.
[154:16.27]That's pretty damn flashy if I would say so myself.
[154:18.48]Get it?
[154:18.94]Good.
[154:21.67]Done.
[154:23.21]In the book.
[154:24.39]Tap.
[154:24.67]Tap.
[154:25.33]What's up with that freak?
[154:35.47]Yeah.
[154:40.34]Good.
[154:40.54]Okay.
[154:43.10]Tap.
[154:48.10]Plenty of time to be pissed off later.
[154:49.32]This is a safe place not far from here.
[154:53.32]Yeah, I hate this place.
[154:54.16]I'll go with you.
[154:56.24]Okay.
[154:56.98]Let's go.
[155:13.99]Just gotta go through a door?
[155:15.05]Am I going the wrong way?
[155:16.35]No.
[155:16.95]Thought I was.
[155:22.39]It's empty.
[155:24.45]Good.
[155:29.35]I can get another one of these things.
[155:35.41]Mannequin.
[155:37.32]Get shoes.
[155:38.04]I don't have time.
[155:38.88]I haven't had time to get shoes since yesterday.
[155:41.80]Follow me!
[156:01.00]I saved him.
[156:04.16]Tad save.
[156:04.72]I sure hope you don't snap one day and freak out like the other photographer guy.
[156:07.34]I won't.
[156:11.10]Say again.
[156:15.26]That's a lot of PP.
[156:21.63]Row distance increased.
[156:23.01]Let's save it.
[156:30.48]This one's going down to the bottom, just in case there's a nightmare scenario.
[156:36.86]Alright.
[156:38.64]Two torsos.
[156:40.84]And we're going to try this mission again.
[156:51.81]It can't be worse than Isabella.
[156:53.61]Well, here's the problem with what you just said.
[156:55.77]It is a car mission.
[156:57.75]There's a mission with somebody driving a car around trying to kill you.
[157:02.55]Get two of these.
[157:09.85]Okay, mannequin torso.
[157:17.67]Alright, let's go.
[157:20.67]I have two heals.
[157:21.73]I have boosts on him.
[157:25.45]Let's go.
[157:25.65]Give me the knife.
[157:38.71]Okay.
[157:42.78]Bomb collector.
[157:44.70]Through... into the... inside of the world.
[157:48.75]The bike can break.
[157:49.95]That's not good.
[157:58.94]Bomb collector.
[158:01.32]I said bomb collector.
[158:11.24]It's saved right here, too.
[158:16.98]Bong water collector.
[158:18.04]Is there, like, a cart or something I can get on to drive?
[158:20.64]What do these other ones do?
[158:26.24]This one is camera.
[158:28.57]And, okay, people are no longer fearful.
[158:30.23]That's good.
[158:41.39]Otis just wants to wish you good luck.
[158:44.59]Otis is really fucking irritating.
[158:51.12]Alright, I get full health.
[158:52.36]That's good.
[158:54.30]Into the garage.
[158:56.02]Oh, fuck.
[158:56.48]They're standing in front of the garage.
[159:00.15]Do not.
[159:08.11]Car battle.
[159:10.64]Car battle.
[159:12.52]Let's go.
[159:26.38]Except... I need to... They have a gun on their car.
[159:31.89]I don't have a gun on my car.
[159:47.44]Alright, what is it?
[159:48.72]Can you hear me?
[159:49.24]It's not... Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[159:50.60]I've been spam called so many times.
[159:52.36]The time bomb should be located inside several trucks parked in the maintenance tunnel.
[159:56.16]As far as I can tell from security monitors, it looks like they split into five locations.
[160:00.32]He slashed the truck's tires, so you'll have to transport the bombs by hand.
[160:04.72]Hurry to the maintenance tunnel, Frank.
[160:08.15]I thought you were Otis the whole time, so that's why I wasn't answering the phone.
[160:13.93]My god.
[160:15.25]And that was every piece of information I needed to hear.
[160:19.50]Wonder who that is.
[160:23.97]Alright, I just have to find... There's a girl in a CD shop!
[160:29.49]Okay.
[160:30.57]Just, I have to go do... I just have to find them.
[160:34.48]Look.
[160:35.72]Okay, so the first one, they're just... I'm just gonna go to all the corners?
[160:41.00]Do I have to do them in order?
[160:42.46]Or just find them?
[160:43.30]Just find them.
[160:50.95]Whatever parked truck.
[160:52.83]Look for parked truck.
[161:03.68]Parked truck down here?
[161:06.46]Parked truck.
[161:08.08]Anyone there?
[161:18.29]This is a Slender Man scenario where the more that I pick up, the more he's going to attack me.
[161:24.49]Alright, making note of it.
[161:25.45]I got the one down center.
[161:28.25]I got the one center down.
[161:30.31]Okay?
[161:31.07]Right, right.
[161:32.81]Around the rotary.
[161:33.55]First right at the rotary.
[161:47.21]Right again.
[161:57.77]Okay.
[161:58.45]Truck down.
[161:59.07]Where's the trucks?
[162:00.69]Right ahead?
[162:01.05]Did the bombs just explode?
[162:24.02]What happened to my bike?! !
[162:26.24]What happened to the bike?!
[162:28.12]Why did it just turn into Legos?!
[162:32.23]Okay, got middle, bottom right, we're gonna go straight up.
[162:36.99]What the fuck, man?!
[162:38.29]I need a shopping cart!
[162:45.77]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?!
[162:49.91]Anybody have another bike, or a shopping cart, or a... Where's Carlito?
[162:59.01]Quick step.
[162:59.65]I don't have any quick step.
[163:03.19]I don't have quick step.
[163:04.57]It's the white one.
[163:07.26]I need a shopping cart.
[163:08.40]Oh, there he is.
[163:09.16]Beep beep.
[163:09.60]Here he comes.
[163:10.24]Hi Carlito.
[163:11.16]Welcome.
[163:12.54]Oh boy.
[163:13.94]This is fucking gonna be fun.
[163:16.60]I have to dodge a guy in an ice cream truck while he tries to back up over and kill me.
[163:21.50]Yeah, by the way, did you notice this guy with the fucking flytrap hands?
[163:43.64]Spitfire?
[163:44.12]What's it mean?
[163:44.54]What's it do?
[163:44.90]What's it do?
[163:45.24]What does Spitfire do?
[163:46.22]Tell me!
[163:48.00]What does it do?
[163:51.74]Shopping cart.
[164:00.66]No, that's- I need that cart.
[164:11.44]No!
[164:18.77]There's a car over here!
[164:20.95]This car's gonna explode!
[164:30.43]Get in!
[164:36.13]Alright, where's the- There's no truck back here?
[164:40.79]Did I miss a truck?
[164:45.67]I didn't see a truck back there.
[164:47.80]Okay, so I got bang, bang.
[164:49.82]We're gonna go all the way up here.
[164:51.20]Turn right.
[165:06.78]Drop right here.
[165:07.24]Alright, slow down.
[165:09.24]I gotta put this in a good spot so I can get the fuck out of here.
[165:18.01]Oh no!
[165:40.67]There's a fucking trillion people here.
[165:42.85]Okay, where now?
[165:45.43]One, two, three, four up here, five down here.
[165:53.61]Top left and then middle left.
[166:03.07]Right here, right?
[166:07.37]I'm kind of freaking out right now.
[166:09.05]Okay, yeah, that one right there.
[166:10.45]So we're gonna go right, left.
[166:12.61]Go.
[166:22.08]Not that one, that's pink.
[166:33.99]And then right.
[166:54.16]Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[166:57.22]Top left.
[166:58.04]Bang it left.
[166:58.70]Straight left.
[167:02.45]No.
[167:03.23]Ah!
[167:04.93]Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
[167:18.41]All the way up.
[167:19.93]Go!
[167:21.03]I don't see headlights.
[167:21.63]No headlights.
[167:21.99]No headlights.
[167:22.35]No headlights.
[167:22.75]No headlights.
[167:23.20]No headlights.
[167:24.58]No headlights.
[167:25.70]No headlights.
[167:26.24]I got checked in gym class.
[167:28.38]No headlights.
[167:28.88]Left.
[167:59.77]What a freak!
[168:05.81]What, what, what?
[168:06.81]What do you mean, get in?
[168:09.55]Wait, what do you mean, get in?
[168:11.17]Get in!
[168:13.06]Where's the bomb?
[168:15.30]Other one.
[168:20.68]Hey!
[168:26.30]Oh shit!
[168:33.40]I got fucking jebaited!
[168:34.80]I got jebaited!
[168:37.20]How do I get out of here?
[168:45.58]Right, right?
[168:47.28]Right, right, in here.
[168:48.24]That's where I'm going?
[168:49.02]Right, right.
[168:54.57]The game's like, the game's fucking lagging.
[168:56.69]The game's like glitching out all over the place.
[169:01.37]Right, right, right, right!
[169:03.23]Oh my god, I just have to leave.
[169:04.59]Oh my god, that was stressful.
[169:34.65]Oh no!
[169:34.81]I really didn't want to do that again.
[169:38.97]I'm so glad I didn't die.
[170:15.48]No, don't!
[170:18.34]Ooh, nice.
[170:19.52]Lock him up.
[170:24.31]Get him.
[170:25.71]The hidden knife.
[170:42.19]Uh oh.
[170:43.59]Are we gonna see the death of a main character?
[170:45.63]Uh oh.
[171:03.54]That's not good.
[171:06.92]That means he's gonna have to fight a hundred thousand zombies by himself.
[171:21.71]He's gonna be surrounded.
[171:22.47]This is gonna be sad.
[171:23.51]I still don't have shoes.
[171:48.06]I've wanted to stop for shoes for, like, six in-game hours.
[171:52.20]How do I like the game?
[171:53.82]I mean, I knew I was gonna like it.
[171:58.12]It's... Okay, hold on.
[171:59.22]Important.
[171:59.98]Done.
[172:01.42]From 5 p.m., case 8.
[172:16.61]Next case will occur at 5 p.m.
[172:19.47]I don't get a save point.
[172:22.65]Holy shit.
[172:26.84]I need to save this game right now.
[172:35.16]Is the save point right here?
[172:36.42]Where?
[172:38.46]I mean, but this is north.
[172:40.38]How do I get there quickly from here?
[172:44.45]Get Brad.
[172:45.09]With one health bar?
[172:46.58]Go back for Brad.
[172:48.22]Save Brad.
[172:51.88]Um... I don't know if I feel safer in the truck.
[172:57.34]Or... Use my heal?
[173:01.64]I don't have one.
[173:06.16]I don't have a heal.
[173:09.02]Go to the food in the park.
[173:10.80]Okay.
[173:11.26]I'm gonna very, very carefully here, guys.
[173:12.90]Go back.
[173:16.60]This is gonna be a fucking disaster.
[173:26.15]Look around the parking lot for a second.
[173:27.41]Is there any food?
[173:34.98]What's that?
[173:37.52]Food in the toolbox?
[173:39.38]Alright, food in the toolbox.
[173:40.28]Come on, there's gotta be like a cabbage in there or something, right?
[173:45.54]Just give me a cabbage.
[173:49.70]I can't eat these.
[173:50.34]I have to leave.
[173:54.08]Okay.
[173:55.04]This thing's smoking.
[173:55.64]Give me the other car.
[174:01.96]Okay.
[174:04.54]I have to save now.
[174:05.90]I'm so... I am, like, actually... I'm, like, scared.
[174:08.42]I have to go quick.
[174:11.40]What's the quickest place to get to a save point from here?
[174:14.32]Save Brad.
[174:14.98]Jump.
[174:15.61]What was that?
[174:22.68]Okay, so if I go straight through to Paradise Plaza.
[174:28.68]And then save point.
[174:31.88]Ayayay.
[174:33.46]Where's the food?
[174:34.84]Oh, I can go... No.
[174:36.12]I'm gonna try to use the tunnels.
[174:40.75]You're gonna get shot in the park.
[174:46.73]So can I go through here?
[174:48.19]And actually go up through the maintenance tunnel?
[174:59.74]No.
[175:00.34]Yes.
[175:04.79]Okay.
[175:06.31]Oh, shit.
[175:06.83]Okay, I can go up here.
[175:10.91]Go to the food court.
[175:11.65]Alright.
[175:12.25]We're gonna go right, straight, all the way to the end, go to the food court.
[175:30.22]I'm gonna clear everything.
[175:31.88]I don't know.
[175:32.34]If I get grabbed once, I'm dead.
[175:35.08]You know what I'm saying?
[175:36.73]Is that hamburger meat?
[175:38.23]Get up.
[175:38.51]Get up.
[175:38.73]I don't know if that is, but I'm not gonna get it.
[175:40.55]Is it hamburger meat?
[175:41.25]It's hamburger meat.
[175:41.77]Oh, thank fucking god.
[175:47.37]Damn it.
[175:47.85]Okay.
[175:54.15]Where does this elevator go to?
[175:55.95]No, I don't wanna use the elevator.
[176:00.90]Right?
[176:02.62]I need the maintenance tunnel key to open it.
[176:07.85]What?
[176:21.23]Brad's gonna die.
[176:22.85]That's too bad.
[176:23.79]Don't you normally just like doing the face cam?
[176:25.79]Yeah, I got pressured into it.
[176:30.01]40% of chat told me this.
[176:32.60]I had one... Alright.
[176:34.50]I know I feel safe that I can get back.
[176:43.44]I'm going to take this car out.
[176:49.16]And I'm going to drive it out of here.
[176:51.29]And just drive through paradise.
[177:00.72]In fact, fuck.
[177:03.75]No, I have to save the damn game, man.
[177:05.69]I've got like a minute to do this next thing.
[177:07.85]I've got to get the fuck out of here.
[177:10.94]Where's the exit?
[177:11.54]Right here, right?
[177:14.38]Forget about Brad.
[177:15.62]I'm sorry.
[177:16.92]And the car's dead.
[177:39.56]I'm sorry, Brad.
[177:40.28]That's just the way it is.
[177:42.66]You didn't get... Alright, Brad.
[177:43.72]You didn't give me a save point.
[177:46.40]So, therefore... I... What am I going to do?
[177:49.78]Lose?
[177:50.06]I'm just going to lose.
[177:53.51]Now I have health.
[177:54.39]I'm going to get in the car and drive the fuck out of here.
[178:00.29]Thank you very much.
[178:03.79]Back to paradise.
[178:06.74]Let's go.
[178:09.12]Sorry, Brad.
[178:11.06]Nothing I can do about this.
[178:13.09]So it's just straight across, right?
[178:14.79]Just straight across.
[178:37.65]Good.
[178:39.81]Okay.
[178:41.15]Back to the... Where's the next mission?
[178:47.60]Jamming device.
[178:49.80]Save it first.
[178:53.28]Save it first, save it first, save it first.
[178:54.76]Bang, left.
[179:03.60]Something horrible could happen on the way over there.
[179:05.67]I could walk and just get smoked on the way back.
[179:10.59]And that's going to be horrible.
[179:12.67]You're going to see some real, real sadness.
[179:14.89]I'm already getting sad that it hasn't even happened.
[179:19.37]Go to the top one.
[179:25.05]Game saved.
[179:28.31]Whew.
[179:29.81]All right.
[179:32.77]What was I looking over there for?
[179:33.77]I told you.
[179:37.75]I told you this was gonna happen.
[179:39.79]I got, like... My... My, like, nervous, anxious gamer skills... Worked.
[179:45.56]And now that I became confident that I was safe... I just got hurt, like, five times.
[179:50.06]Let's get some batteries.
[180:04.13]Nice.
[180:07.58]Get rid of this shit.
[180:09.50]I don't even need it.
[180:11.60]This door sneaks up on you, too.
[180:16.46]Shoes?
[180:16.92]No time for shoes.
[180:24.10]That one's fucking dead again.
[180:26.80]Get that clean.
[180:57.82]That was a courage scream.
[181:03.45]Okay.
[181:05.39]Good to go.
[181:07.97]Hi, guys.
[181:11.30]Save it in here.
[181:12.42]With one health, though, that might... that's a soft lock potential.
[181:15.78]I'm gonna do one down.
[181:22.85]Go to the gun store and show them the picture.
[181:24.57]I don't have enough time.
[181:26.99]I've got, like... I'm not gonna be able to make it back.
[181:37.86]Go get food on the roof.
[181:42.19]kill brad save brad kill brad uh all right so this is it is four it's four o'clock what is it 4 30 for this is there anything else no
[182:09.03]Nothing.
[182:09.79]No way for me to get food up here.
[182:11.03]I could go to the heliport.
[182:14.74]Alright.
[182:15.38]Let me look up here.
[182:19.02]Food?
[182:21.86]Weapon?
[182:23.62]Armor?
[182:37.61]What's that?
[182:43.31]Uh, nothing up here.
[182:44.67]What about up there?
[182:45.45]Can I get up that?
[182:46.35]I think I can climb that.
[182:51.77]On the dumpster and then over?
[182:57.86]Almost.
[182:59.26]Come on now.
[183:04.14]Come on, I can't get up this.
[183:06.91]It so badly wants me to be able to do this.
[183:13.07]Nothing even up here.
[183:15.59]There's nothing on the roof.
[183:18.51]Well, then what the hell am I doing up here?
[183:25.34]Why did I come up here?
[183:39.08]This is the final battle arena?
[183:40.58]Oh.
[183:42.58]What about the boxes?
[183:43.48]That's kind of annoying.
[183:50.02]Brad is dying and you're just letting it happen.
[183:54.20]Yes.
[183:56.00]Yes, that is exactly what's happening.
[184:00.20]Oops, sorry.
[184:01.96]I just... That hurts.
[184:05.22]Okay.
[184:10.26]Um, what time is it?
[184:11.76]Alright, I got like 30 minutes to do nothing.
[184:15.82]Because it's not, it's too risky.
[184:18.00]And I don't, I need food, but I don't have any food.
[184:20.79]So I can't really do anything.
[184:24.41]Get shoes on.
[184:31.29]Save Brad.
[184:33.46]I'm gonna laugh if Brad's not even saveable.
[184:40.78]Yeah, I'm not comfortable going out there right now.
[184:43.22]Not with one, um... cheese square.
[184:47.18]I'm not going out there with one single cheese slice.
[184:49.16]I'm sorry I had to do that.
[184:59.79]I had to do it again.
[185:07.65]You're a bully.
[185:11.58]You can get some more craft singles on the way.
[185:13.09]Yeah, on the way to the next mission.
[185:17.65]I don't want to miss the case.
[185:21.35]Uh, what do I have left?
[185:22.77]Status.
[185:24.39]Is there like a... Yeah, go to case file.
[185:27.23]So I'm on case 8?
[185:27.89]This is the last case.
[185:31.59]And then I have the facts.
[185:36.97]Oh, shit.
[185:37.81]I got the last... This is the last case.
[185:42.05]Let's go!
[185:53.99]I've had it!
[185:54.99]I've had it!
[185:55.89]I've had it!
[185:56.75]I've had it!
[186:01.35]So, this game would be really awesome.
[186:03.47]And don't spoil it, but tell me if I'm right.
[186:06.23]At the end of the game, you have a final showdown.
[186:10.25]And everybody that you saved is all one group and you have to do a big final showdown.
[186:16.82]That was pretty fun.
[186:19.00]And the more people that you save, the more power that you have in the final fight.
[186:31.30]That was pretty cool.
[186:32.95]For Dead Rising 5, do that.
[186:40.84]I still forgot there was even a Dead Rising 4.
[186:42.46]Alright, so what do you think?
[186:44.76]I'm getting, like, the end of the game here.
[186:46.60]Is this a... Well, maybe, like, another hour or two, but still.
[186:51.13]You wanna... I think I'm just gonna do Dead Rising 2.
[186:52.93]I think I'm actually just gonna play Dead Rising 2.
[186:54.57]I'm having fun.
[187:01.93]It's holding my interest completely.
[187:06.92]Yeah, well, put Dead Rising 2 on the list.
[187:08.52]I'll do it, you know...
[187:11.77]There's a Frank West campaign, isn't there?
[187:14.51]Which version of Dead Rising 2?
[187:18.13]The one that's on Steam?
[187:19.41]I already own it.
[187:25.55]Is that the right one?
[187:29.13]Off the record.
[187:32.58]Alright, it's 5 o'clock.
[187:33.30]Let's see what happens.
[187:39.80]As soon as Brad gets his hands on that terrorist, I guess it'll be case closed, huh?
[187:44.26]Got some bad news about Brad.
[187:46.60]Oh.
[187:49.76]You know of anything else he could be planning?
[187:53.20]No.
[187:54.64]Nothing but the bombs.
[188:00.23]He's got his computer hidden away.
[188:02.71]I'm sure there's plenty of information on it.
[188:05.35]Can you take me there?
[188:07.21]To his hideout?
[188:09.03]Leave it to me.
[188:17.82]That's case one done.
[188:19.26]Case two.
[188:22.86]Fuck, man.
[188:23.52]I think we're almost at the end of the game.
[188:26.46]Hideout.
[188:27.18]Mindy Baker is dead.
[188:28.48]Debbie Willett is dead.
[188:29.69]Who are these people?
[188:31.21]Scoop.
[188:31.63]Oh.
[188:41.49]Wait, does Isabelle have to come with me?
[188:43.60]No.
[188:44.98]Oh, she does.
[188:46.10]This is going to be fantastic.
[188:49.74]Can't wait for this one.
[188:54.77]She's already broken.
[188:57.95]Oh no, I have to activate her.
[188:59.21]At least she has a gun.
[189:00.11]Alright, so am I following you?
[189:03.54]Or are you following me?
[189:06.92]Which one is it?
[189:14.34]Facecam.
[189:14.97]In like another five minutes.
[189:24.95]Is she even down here?
[189:25.63]Oh, what a pain in the ass.
[189:31.35]I killed everybody in this elevator, and you're telling me that they got in?
[189:34.46]I don't have anything else to... How are you filling up the elevator?
[189:45.28]Get in here!
[189:48.24]What are you doing?
[189:49.12]Hello?
[190:01.23]Hello?
[190:01.61]Hello?
[190:02.53]Anyone there?
[190:03.09]Hello?
[190:03.61]Hello?
[190:05.93]Do I have to talk to her again?
[190:10.93]Get in the fucking elevator!
[190:13.21]Get in the elevator!
[190:17.64]Yes!
[190:18.04]You have to get in here!
[190:39.90]She shot me in the fucking head.
[190:43.20]Okay, let's go.
[190:46.04]Let's get moving.
[190:53.48]Yeah.
[190:54.58]There it is.
[190:55.00]He set the line.
[190:55.60]He set the title.
[191:01.44]Finally.
[191:01.86]It took you one second this time.
[191:03.26]Alright, you're going to have to do some work here.
[191:12.95]Yeah.
[191:19.37]Let's go.
[191:21.29]Alright, well thankfully she's kind of on her own.
[191:22.79]She has her own mind.
[191:23.91]I need food.
[191:27.27]So we need to go through... Well, I'm just gonna put the hideout thing on.
[191:31.41]Just because I lose her.
[191:34.01]That was a loud scream.
[191:37.27]If I get fucking sneezed on, it's gonna be over.
[191:48.96]Drink the paint.
[191:52.22]Whoa!
[191:52.90]This is horrible.
[191:56.00]I'm in such deep shit.
[191:57.23]I need food.
[191:58.17]I need like a smoothie bar upstairs.
[192:00.49]I'm going to make a smoothie.
[192:02.57]She'll be fine.
[192:22.43]Alright.
[192:24.21]Two pies.
[192:29.60]Just hang on.
[192:32.06]I need to eat something.
[192:36.64]I'll be down in a second.
[192:37.62]I'm coming!
[192:52.80]You didn't even need my help.
[192:53.70]You got out.
[193:02.81]Lead the way.
[193:09.90]I need that back.
[193:22.54]How did I stab you twice?
[193:23.94]She can't defect, right?
[193:24.83]She's like a story NPC.
[193:30.33]That's useful.
[193:30.81]I've got two of them now.
[193:31.49]Give me that.
[193:36.71]No, save this.
[193:37.19]I'm probably going to need to shoot somebody.
[193:42.58]Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if this is like a big boss fight and I have to shoot.
[193:47.78]We're not actually going this way, are we?
[193:58.97]Why are we going this way?
[194:05.52]He's hugging this wall, alright.
[194:10.90]Another queen.
[194:11.52]It's dark over here.
[194:23.09]So where's this super special hideout?
[194:31.92]Oh shit, that's empty.
[194:34.82]I'm out.
[194:36.02]I need a rake.
[194:37.76]Any rakes over here?
[194:46.45]This escort mission sucks.
[194:48.19]Total asshole.
[194:49.11]So I really hope this is not that hard to do.
[194:53.98]I think you got him.
[195:10.78]Just go.
[195:11.20]What are you waiting for?
[195:12.72]I'm just an NPC.
[195:28.37]Okay, you have a full path.
[195:30.91]You shot that guy in the head ten times.
[195:32.31]Alright, move, move, move, move, move.
[195:35.83]Facecam.
[195:36.80]No, for every two hours of facecam, I have one hour of no facecam.
[195:39.84]That's the deal.
[195:40.86]That's what you agreed to.
[195:45.80]Feetcam.
[195:49.21]Not in a hundred million years.
[195:50.81]All right, no!
[195:54.71]Get up!
[195:58.29]Is she close enough?
[196:02.94]Yeah.
[196:05.67]Alright, is it food?
[196:06.37]Is it food?
[196:09.87]Nice.
[196:10.47]Alright.
[196:13.43]What do we got?
[196:13.95]Something behind the counter.
[196:16.01]Batteries for the camera.
[196:17.27]Food or something.
[196:19.29]There's no food here?
[196:23.79]Good.
[196:24.51]It's like a cantaloupe.
[196:27.59]Okay.
[196:28.07]That's great.
[196:29.33]That helps.
[196:29.69]I need a weapon, though.
[196:42.68]I should save it.
[196:44.18]If we're going up here, I'm gonna try to save it right there.
[196:48.01]Do a mouth cam?
[196:48.77]Oh, this game's too hard for that.
[197:07.36]Bring back the nose cam!
[197:09.98]Yeah, I can't, like, stop right now.
[197:11.70]It's like a stressful, hard video game that cannot have a nosecam attached.
[197:17.31]Because that means I can't play the game at a level that is expected of me.
[197:23.15]Which is, a nosecam makes it like a 4 out of 10.
[197:26.69]And no nosecam makes it like a 5.5 to 6 out of 10.
[197:29.09]Shit, we're going to the gun store.
[197:34.76]We are going to the gun store.
[197:38.24]This does not seem like a good idea.
[197:40.16]Fuck off.
[197:55.61]This is the secret hideout?
[197:58.69]I...
[198:08.17]Is this gonna go up to the hardware store?
[198:10.97]Did I already find this?
[198:12.80]Here it is.
[198:13.90]Let's go.
[198:22.44]Okay.
[198:29.21]Is there any stuff?
[198:30.51]Oh, shit.
[198:30.89]Shit.
[198:38.42]It's a shitty hideout.
[198:42.91]Not very glamorous.
[198:43.77]His dog.
[198:46.31]His mother's birthday.
[198:48.47]Family stuff.
[198:48.79]What's this cable?
[199:09.25]It looks like part of a jamming device.
[199:12.57]I won't be able to disable it unless I log in.
[199:14.50]It's an Ethernet cable, yeah.
[199:18.20]That's the power, Frank.
[199:20.72]What's this thing do?
[199:23.56]Frank, can you hear me?
[199:27.34]I found something interesting on a security feed from inside a store.
[199:31.13]Could you come back here?
[199:32.29]I need you to check it out.
[199:34.23]Alright, I'm headed back now.
[199:36.37]Don't unplug it then.
[199:37.25]You've got to get the evidence out of it.
[199:40.87]Well, I have to go back?
[199:49.89]Jesse's Discovery.
[199:51.95]I have to go all the way back.
[199:56.13]Are you kidding me?
[199:58.09]Um... Oh, alright.
[200:00.75]Alright, bye.
[200:02.49]I'll take- I'll do the Wonderlands again.
[200:08.61]Gun store.
[200:09.09]Do I still have that photo?
[200:14.99]There it is.
[200:19.24]Take a picture.
[200:20.08]Ree!
[200:20.46]Take a picture!
[200:21.04]Ree!
[200:21.48]Ree!
[200:21.74]You didn't take the picture!
[200:22.68]You didn't take the picture!
[200:25.14]Okay.
[200:25.30]Yeah, take a picture.
[200:26.00]Ready?
[200:26.84]Haha.
[200:28.16]Reggie, ready?
[200:28.74]There.
[200:37.70]That's what you guys wanted?
[200:38.46]You fucking cretins.
[200:51.46]Let's get out of here.
[200:55.50]Save the game.
[200:57.28]So, I'm going to... First, I'm going to do the gun thing, because I have the photo.
[201:01.67]Hopefully, I can get back there fast enough.
[201:07.39]Here's the gun shop.
[201:11.07]In fact, I... Yeah, I can't fuck around here.
[201:13.63]I'm just dropping one.
[201:14.51]I'm dropping one.
[201:14.95]I got a ton of them.
[201:18.81]Okay.
[201:20.41]That's good.
[201:20.93]Hey.
[201:23.83]It's me.
[201:25.45]I'm the guy with the picture.
[201:34.71]Oh, shit.
[201:35.25]Freaked out.
[201:37.37]Uh, okay.
[201:39.11]Get...
[201:47.66]No, I want a handgun.
[201:48.46]I want something bigger than that.
[201:49.24]Sneeze.
[201:49.52]Hit it coming.
[201:54.08]Was it real shit?
[201:55.64]Shotgun.
[201:56.66]Sniper rifle.
[201:58.04]Sniper rifle.
[201:59.44]Shotgun.
[202:01.41]Get rid of the handgun.
[202:03.29]Um, what's in here?
[202:04.09]Is it a handgun?
[202:12.93]Was there an assault rifle?
[202:16.25]Sniper rifle.
[202:19.88]Shotgun, shotgun.
[202:24.12]Handgun.
[202:27.30]Nothing else.
[202:29.52]Nothing else.
[202:29.86]There's nothing else here.
[202:32.47]Take all of it.
[202:33.13]I'm gonna take... Give me another shotgun.
[202:38.23]And then give me a... Another sniper rifle.
[202:43.09]Okay.
[202:44.65]Two shotguns and... Give me another shotgun.
[202:57.26]Okay.
[202:59.54]Drop the pamphlet?
[203:02.48]Remember, you fool.
[203:03.16]You dropped food.
[203:06.36]It was a fucking cabbage.
[203:07.44]It's gonna be like one health.
[203:08.76]I don't care.
[203:09.20]Alright, I gotta go.
[203:20.92]It was a can of food.
[203:22.18]What?!
[203:22.40]I have to leave!
[203:27.54]Where is it?
[203:27.92]What does this one do?
[203:43.73]Any more shotguns?
[203:48.93]Handgun.
[203:50.75]Fuck.
[203:52.97]No.
[203:53.69]Handgun.
[203:55.85]I can't take any more shotguns.
[203:56.73]I'm just taking a handgun.
[204:03.32]I need to... I have to actually... I have to use this to make my way back.
[204:06.44]Okay, now I'm gonna go from here.
[204:07.52]I have to go... Where the hell does this want me to go?
[204:15.02]Where is this trying to... Where is this taking me?
[204:19.07]Save in the hideout. Save in the hideout. Save in the hideout. Save in the hideout. Save in the hideout. Save in the hideout.
[204:28.63]Carlito's hideout?
[204:35.45]Which one of these, like, rundown rooms was it in?
[204:39.22]This one?
[204:43.72]Where's the save point?
[204:51.17]I didn't know this, like, rug was a save point.
[204:52.83]Alright, I need to pick another slot all the way down at the bottom.
[205:16.04]There you go, I got it.
[205:35.41]I went the wrong way!
[205:36.99]I'm just panicking.
[205:40.52]This is just panic the video game.
[205:49.39]Not good.
[205:57.82]Alright.
[206:00.34]What is this about to go?
[206:01.92]Oh my god, I hate you guys so much!
[206:07.42]Fuck, there's so many up in the north area!
[206:11.21]Can't food.
[206:14.51]You guys are the worst.
[206:15.75]Really?
[206:22.74]Unbelievable.
[206:24.48]You made me go back and pick up the canned food and I can't even eat it?
[206:28.67]Oh, you guys are unbelievable.
[206:32.09]Unbelievable.
[206:32.63]What's this?
[206:45.64]Unbelievable.
[206:55.38]Canned food, canned food.
[206:57.69]Wow, you idiot.
[206:58.83]Pick up the canned food, dumbass.
[207:05.17]Dog laugh?
[207:06.97]You mean the dog...
[207:27.98]Oh, is that what you want to get?
[207:29.08]Is that what you want to get?
[207:31.28]You too?
[207:31.84]Oh, sure.
[207:32.16]Thank God.
[207:35.11]I'm on my way.
[207:46.45]Jump.
[207:46.81]I'm trying to jump on his head.
[207:48.09]Oh, my God.
[207:53.11]I'm trying to jump on his head.
[207:59.71]Oh, I can go up to the cafe.
[208:05.54]He's going full tuber at this point.
[208:08.54]Not quite.
[208:09.04]Hit the bell.
[208:22.64]Do I still even have the bell on YouTube?
[208:25.70]Why did I not jump on his head?
[208:28.52]Explain it.
[208:29.56]I want a full expo- I want a paragraph from every one of you, everybody here.
[208:33.29]As to why that didn't jump on his head.
[208:34.53]A full paragraph.
[208:42.72]I'm not seeing very many paragraphs.
[208:58.92]This is gonna be bad.
[209:00.10]Here comes a terrible scenario.
[209:10.97]Terrible scenario.
[209:11.89]Terrible scenario.
[209:12.71]Terrible scenario.
[209:13.47]Here it comes.
[209:19.18]Holy fuck.
[209:33.19]We're good.
[209:37.55]Take a look at this.
[209:38.65]Who is that?
[209:39.29]The guy being dragged?
[209:44.12]I think it's Carlito.
[209:47.18]You could be right.
[209:49.42]Where is this?
[209:50.78]The basement of the North Plaza.
[209:52.12]I have to go all the way back there.
[209:59.84]Forward, back, forth, back, forth.
[210:04.57]You couldn't have put these next to each other?
[210:07.89]Oh.
[210:08.51]My.
[210:09.35]Fucking.
[210:10.07]God.
[210:19.68]I gotta save the damn game too?
[210:24.66]What the fuck?
[210:26.52]I'm not gonna make it down there in time.
[210:40.04]I don't even know which one of these is a good... They're in the middle?
[210:42.12]I don't know.
[210:42.48]I have so many different timelines.
[210:48.41]Okay.
[210:49.29]What's the fastest way to get there?
[210:52.43]The butcher.
[210:53.05]Am I even going to be able to do this?
[210:57.15]I just came from there.
[211:09.44]I have to just run through the park.
[211:16.32]Run to the parking lot and then drop.
[211:17.54]I don't have the key to open the doors.
[211:29.40]Go through the tunnel.
[211:33.44]Go through park with bike.
[211:37.56]But where's the... There's no bike.
[211:40.86]The maintenance... I don't have the maintenance key.
[211:42.64]Remember I tried to go up from the tunnel and I didn't have the maintenance key to leave?
[211:57.85]Well, let's see if I can get... I don't have... I need health, too.
[212:00.56]This is kind of a disaster.
[212:04.78]He's entrapping us.
[212:10.57]Um... Well, let me see what happens when I... I need to get food.
[212:19.76]Through the tunnels.
[212:21.92]But where's the key?
[212:22.56]I don't have enough time to do this.
[212:27.70]I think it's over.
[212:34.95]Make a quick step?
[212:35.69]Yeah, but by the time I make, like, two or three quick steps, it's over.
[212:49.51]I definitely have time.
[212:50.85]Do I though?
[213:02.21]How is that even possible to miss?
[213:06.09]Why would you shoot up and to the right?
[213:09.67]This might be the beginning of the end here.
[213:11.31]I might be softlocked.
[213:16.24]It's very possible.
[213:18.70]Because I got to get up there and I probably have to kill the boss in this timeline.
[213:25.48]Food in the box near the elevator.
[213:26.66]I have plenty of weapons.
[213:37.65]Yeah.
[213:57.98]He's just not on my list of things to do.
[214:06.98]Get it on!
[214:21.05]Tons of time.
[214:21.93]I don't know.
[214:23.19]I've still got to get up to the cafe.
[214:26.09]What the fuck?
[214:28.61]Fuck I should've picked up two.
[214:46.24]I should've picked up two.
[214:47.62]What the fuck was I doing?
[214:59.82]Okay, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, orange juice.
[215:02.43]Oh god, give me that.
[215:03.73]Oh my god, there's a fucking million of them.
[215:05.37]There's a million of them.
[215:06.73]There's a million of them.
[215:08.33]There's a million of them.
[215:11.19]Ah, what do I get for a handgun?
[215:16.29]Oh shit, okay.
[215:17.44]Alright, wait, wait, two orange juices.
[215:19.42]What does that do?
[215:20.62]I don't have time to figure this out.
[215:29.11]I don't even know what this is.
[215:30.23]Nectar?
[215:30.89]Okay.
[215:32.03]Drop the sniper rifles for the orange juice.
[215:41.20]Okay, that's good, right?
[215:43.56]I have to leave.
[215:45.72]Okay, I have to leave right now.
[215:47.78]Bye.
[215:48.88]Out of time.
[215:50.78]Drink one.
[215:51.44]Fuck.
[215:56.80]Go.
[216:08.45]Should I save it?
[216:09.43]No.
[216:09.87]It could be a disaster if I save it.
[216:24.74]I have so many shotgun bullets.
[216:31.04]There's too many.
[216:33.56]I just gotta get there and get a shopping cart and run.
[216:46.19]Is the motorcycle... Does anybody know what the actual time is that I need to beat this by?
[216:57.63]Why is it telling me to go this way?
[217:06.32]Wait, why am I going this way?
[217:14.30]You have to take the tunnel, so I get the car.
[217:16.32]I get the motorcycle.
[217:18.82]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[217:33.14]Okay, motorcycle.
[217:36.97]Do I have time?
[217:43.53]I have to go, but the save point is so far behind this.
[217:47.32]Okay, now go which way?
[217:56.46]Which way?
[217:56.82]Which way?
[217:57.24]Which way?
[217:57.78]Get off my screen!
[218:02.02]Straight and then left.
[218:18.73]What's this GPS bullshit?
[218:30.04]I did it.
[218:30.34]I have to kill him.
[218:33.24]In... Like 30 seconds.
[218:40.53]I have like three shotguns.
[218:47.73]Is it enough?
[219:03.37]This is good meat, huh?
[219:06.05]I just got it in here.
[219:08.38]It's fresh.
[219:11.74]You just wait right there, sir.
[219:14.28]In a moment, you can try the best ground meat you've ever tasted.
[219:19.02]Whoa, ground?
[219:20.34]Wait a minute, listen.
[219:21.81]I had something else in mind.
[219:24.25]Zombies are no good.
[219:28.13]I can't serve my customers spoiled meat like that.
[219:33.97]Keep this guy alive.
[219:36.27]I mean, he'd be a pretty good companion.
[219:44.02]Huge meat flavor.
[219:45.52]All right, he's turning on this machine, which... Can I push him in it?
[219:58.51]Or do I just have to kill him?
[220:07.55]Shotgun.
[220:07.95]Shotgun, head.
[220:08.57]Shotgun, head.
[220:09.63]Head shotgun.
[220:10.31]Okay, you got it.
[220:20.53]He's got throwing knives.
[220:31.35]Ow, that hurt.
[220:38.38]Am I shooting Carlito in the head?
[220:47.68]I tried to dodge it.
[221:08.48]Oh, fuck!
[221:09.28]Please!
[221:21.58]Oh, sorry!
[221:28.81]No invisibility frames!
[221:41.74]Was it enough?
[221:59.72]He's crying, you prick.
[222:05.48]You're finished.
[222:08.12]It's over.
[222:10.39]What about Isabella?
[222:18.64]She's on our side now.
[222:21.72]She's checking out your computer right now.
[222:30.31]My purpose in life has been to get revenge.
[222:35.11]For what you people did to Santa Cabeza.
[222:37.99]To my hometown.
[222:39.31]What are you guys talking about?
[222:44.03]Why?
[222:45.47]Why was your meat so much more important to you than human life?
[222:49.26]Why?
[222:50.48]Why did my people have to die to feed your fat bellies?
[222:55.88]That doesn't excuse what you've done.
[223:02.12]So, does he die?
[223:03.72]I know it's the end of the movie, but why would I ask that at the end of the movie?
[223:09.70]Hey.
[223:35.08]That's the password.
[223:35.82]That was an easy password.
[223:37.80]I mean, all they do is eat.
[223:44.73]And eat.
[223:46.19]And eat.
[223:48.19]Growing in number.
[223:51.11]Just like you good red, white, and blue Americans.
[224:09.74]This was just chapter one you've got three more chapters after this one If you thought the butcher was annoying
[224:33.39]Wait till you get to the... I'm trying to name something that wasn't in this game, but I can't think of anything that wasn't in the game.
[224:43.37]Like, police officer.
[224:46.39]Clown.
[224:47.15]No, two, both in it.
[224:50.63]Like, psycho guy with mask on it.
[224:54.39]Hey.
[224:55.13]Demon.
[224:56.41]Probably.
[224:59.64]Pants.
[225:00.20]Yeah.
[225:01.76]Astronaut.
[225:03.79]There's probably an astronaut in the game.
[225:05.23]It's probably one of the psychos.
[225:20.74]Done.
[225:22.66]The facts.
[225:24.06]Case 8.4 done.
[225:25.56]From 10 p.m.
[225:26.54]The next case will occur at 10 p.m.
[225:30.64]Uh-oh.
[225:31.88]Where's that one?
[225:33.83]Where's that one?
[225:36.31]Where's that one?
[225:38.39]Um, I have a meat cleaver.
[225:40.01]I gotta go.
[225:44.09]There's probably something cool in here, but I don't have time.
[225:48.93]Save the game?
[225:49.59]Where?
[225:51.29]Where's my car?
[225:57.72]No, there is a car.
[226:02.41]Scott, why is it I have no time?
[226:04.91]Where do I go?
[226:10.21]The hideout.
[226:12.33]Oh, shit.
[226:14.33]Um... Okay, so can I get- I can't get up this way.
[226:25.44]I have to go out and to the park again.
[226:29.47]I have to go right, right, and then I have to take the car and then out to the park into North Plaza.
[226:39.14]Right, left, left.
[226:43.12]You can get the key in the tunnel here.
[226:45.16]In here?
[226:45.82]I don't have... Guys, there's no save point.
[226:54.67]I think I have to go with what I know.
[226:59.20]I'm gonna go right.
[226:59.94]I'm gonna go right.
[227:04.16]That's all I'm doing.
[227:05.14]That's what I'm doing.
[227:10.20]I gotta go with what I know.
[227:11.74]And that's all I know.
[227:21.42]Do I need to get out of the car?
[227:23.58]Stay in this one.
[227:24.26]Good.
[227:25.58]No, uh, travel time.
[227:30.27]Good.
[227:32.43]Frank, this Cheryl girl, she just wants to talk to you about something.

[230:34.32]She's been up here just doing drugs the whole time.

[230:42.86]Now she's gonna pick up, I'm gonna give her like an axe and she's gonna swing it twice.
[230:46.46]Her eye pupils are gonna be like the size of fucking footballs.
[230:51.58]She's gonna bump into walls and shit.
[231:03.99]In the end, all he really cared about was his sister.
[231:12.20]Jerk.
[231:15.68]Did I beat the game?
[231:17.64]Is this the end?
[231:26.43]He said there's something inside that you really would like.
[231:35.17]She opens it.
[231:36.57]It's like fucking like drug dust.
[231:41.12]There it is.
[231:42.64]Drug?
[231:43.10]Just say cocaine.
[231:44.24]Am I gonna not?
[231:45.10]I can't say cocaine?
[231:46.74]Is that against the law?
[231:47.50]Me saying the word cocaine?
[231:56.22]Why do I feel like I was gonna get in trouble for saying cocaine?
[231:59.10]Is my mother watching?
[232:00.12]She might be.
[232:22.35]Yeah, it's my mother's own personal terms of service.
[232:25.97]Don't talk about drugs.
[232:27.75]Don't talk about anything like sexual, Jeremy.
[232:30.50]You're better than that.
[232:32.32]I got a personal mom, TOS.
[232:33.66]That's right.
[232:34.02]Mother Earth, our parents said that a lot.
[232:40.00]You're right.
[232:40.78]That's right.
[232:42.82]Santa Cabeza was blessed with nature.
[232:54.14]She just snorted it.
[232:57.23]I was actually right.
[233:16.88]That's pretty good.
[233:17.34]It's like latte art for cocaine and shit.
[233:19.90]Nice.
[233:31.71]All cases closed, but... But what?
[233:36.40]What does that mean?
[233:45.73]But.
[233:48.53]But what?
[233:49.99]Saved.
[233:53.33]Cheryl's request.
[234:01.82]I know I was wrong.
[234:02.48]He harmed too many innocents and thought only of himself.
[234:05.54]Even so... I got a long time to do this.
[234:07.34]It actually is Chapter 2.
[234:17.13]Alright, let's go.
[234:25.90]I have to be on the roof at the right time?
[234:28.32]What time is it right now?
[234:32.26]It's 1020 on the 21st.
[234:38.68]What time do I have to get on the roof?
[234:46.82]Roof now.
[235:02.01]This is agent Jessica McCartney.
[235:04.19]We have an emergency situation.
[235:07.69]Huh?
[235:13.53]All right.
[235:14.17]Why did you put me on hold?
[235:26.36]Do a suplex.
[235:29.80]Hold on.
[235:34.42]Skills.
[235:36.10]Roundhouse kick.
[235:36.76]Okay, lift up.
[235:37.74]Lift a zombie and give them a toss with this skill.
[235:40.80]Press X and A without pushing anything, and then press X again to throw.
[235:45.17]Alright, knee drop.
[235:47.63]During a jump, press X while pushing down.
[235:50.39]Grab your opponent and send them flying.
[235:51.73]Facing a standing enemy's back, press X and A without pushing anything.
[235:58.28]Yeah.
[236:02.57]Oh, that's awesome.
[236:04.07]Alright, let's go.
[236:05.17]I need a shopping cart.
[236:19.35]Get more guns?
[236:20.93]Is that necessary?
[236:21.51]Oh, I wish I had this before.
[236:29.28]What's going on?
[236:32.88]Frank, it's over.
[236:36.88]HQ's decided to ignore us.
[236:40.29]What?
[236:41.99]What do you mean, ignore us?
[236:43.25]It's over.
[236:44.17]I contacted headquarters, but... The government has decided to deny all knowledge of what happened here.
[236:53.81]Special forces will arrive for cleanup at midnight.
[236:57.69]Midnight?
[236:58.47]They'll take everyone out.
[237:00.80]So I steal the helicopter that they landed.
[237:02.26]That's easy.
[237:11.10]Oh, fuck!
[237:11.88]What's wrong with me lately?
[237:18.31]I can't even mute.
[237:19.17]It's just power that comes out of me.
[237:21.07]I can't even stop it.
[237:22.87]I can't even press mute in time.
[237:27.37]Go to the roof right now.
[237:30.85]Am I going to make it?
[237:49.75]Just leave the mall.
[237:50.97]Laughing my ass off.
[237:55.45]I don't have enough time to do this.
[237:56.49]What time is it?
[238:00.15]I got like an hour.
[238:00.79]I guess I turned around here.
[238:04.87]Alright, everyone just leave me the fuck alone.
[238:07.03]I need to go this way.
[238:15.95]I'm gonna get a gun.
[238:16.55]Alright, like the Yoshi stomp is seriously so good.
[238:27.38]Who's in the middle of opening the door, you fucker?
[238:32.73]Okay, guns.
[238:34.07]Here we go.
[238:35.39]Shotgun.
[238:36.25]Sniper rifle.
[238:39.86]Uh, as many shotguns as I can grab.
[238:41.30]That's not a gun.
[238:44.78]Any more shotguns?
[238:49.34]Isn't there one leaning over here?
[238:50.64]Just take the other sniper rifle.
[238:51.88]Fuck it.
[238:52.38]Alright, let's go.
[238:57.92]How did they all get in here?
[239:04.71]Did you seriously... Did I just get stopped?
[239:09.35]That takes priority?
[239:10.21]This is a fighting game?
[239:12.67]All right.
[239:14.61]I got some guns.
[239:16.15]Still have orange juice.
[239:19.75]Unbelievable.
[239:20.47]All right.
[239:35.16]Out.
[239:37.18]Back to the helipad.
[239:46.03]Give me a cart.
[239:58.58]Facecam for the ending?
[239:59.60]Alright, fine.
[240:00.90]Not yet, though.
[240:02.56]I do want a cart.
[240:18.90]By midnight, right?
[240:19.90]I got time.
[240:20.26]I don't even know what just happened, but I'm okay.
[240:37.97]I never took care of these guys, did I?
[240:42.93]Did it seriously just stop?
[240:44.63]It's broken already?
[240:47.81]I was gonna say, give me a break.
[240:49.48]What's wrong with this thing?
[240:50.46]I can't use it outside?
[241:16.43]I got... I have time.
[241:17.35]I'm okay.
[241:18.44]I got ammo.
[241:19.54]I got decent healing.
[241:28.86]By decent healing, I mean none, but I'm gonna go in here, and I'm going to go up, and I'm gonna make another smoothie.
[241:43.19]Smoothie...
[241:45.06]Smoothies with orange juice.
[241:47.04]And then I'm gonna try to get the blue chainsaw.
[241:50.55]You feeling me here?
[241:51.51]You understand what I'm saying, right?
[241:55.25]Okay, I gotta go up.
[242:00.33]Every time, man.
[242:02.46]Leave me alone.
[242:04.50]You guys are just fucking aggravating me.
[242:07.56]Just aggravating.
[242:11.80]Time check.
[242:13.18]Close.
[242:13.36]Close.
[242:23.96]Let's go.
[242:31.35]That's a lot of fucking time.
[242:32.87]I don't have time to get the chainsaw.
[242:43.28]What are you doing?
[243:02.64]I need a sword.
[243:03.72]Weapon.
[243:04.32]Something.

[244:42.25]What's going on?
[244:54.03]Jessica McCarney?
[244:59.75]Talk about your close calls.
[245:01.80]I don't know why I thought that was me.
[245:02.86]Is this like a cutscene where I got dressed and got a gun and everything?
[245:39.94]Uh-oh.
[245:40.71]Well, that's, um... That's not good.
[246:18.04]Pretty good observation, yeah.
[246:19.28]That was not good.
[246:20.68]I got 15 minutes.
[246:34.03]Jesse.
[246:36.72]You all right in there?
[246:37.54]Are you just taking out some anger against like a punching bag or the wall?
[246:41.18]Are you just unloading a clip into something?
[246:44.66]If only Brad was alive.
[246:48.89]Time until hello.
[246:51.49]Oh, I have 12 hours and 13 minutes.
[247:04.91]Well, I'm here.
[247:09.80]Wait.
[247:12.60]Is everybody turned?
[247:14.24]Is everybody a zombie now?
[247:15.46]That's not good.
[247:16.12]Is it the thing I said before, but not the thing I said?
[247:20.01]Just like, the reverse of what I just said?
[247:31.74]Everybody's a zombie.
[247:43.04]Right?
[247:58.45]Guys?
[248:08.44]That's not a bad photo
[248:16.69]I got her head upside down.
[248:21.61]Alright, I gotta do this right.
[248:27.16]That's not... Okay, that's... I'm trying to zoom.
[248:29.42]How do I zoom in with a sniper rifle?
[248:30.50]Do I have to hold the button down?
[248:32.48]How do I shoot it?
[248:34.76]Oh, okay.
[248:35.46]That's how.
[248:35.80]Okay.
[248:40.83]Okay.
[248:48.73]What?
[248:49.79]What happened?
[248:54.58]What happened?
[248:55.06]I had 12 hours.
[249:22.94]They're clearing this out.
[249:23.88]This is fine.
[249:43.47]Okay.
[249:44.91]Uh, anybody left in here?
[249:48.25]I got some bad news, guys.
[249:52.96]There's nobody here.
[250:04.87]Um... Okay.
[250:14.78]I'm gonna change this slot to right in the middle.
[250:32.08]There's a note on the table.
[250:34.60]Frank, while you were out, some crazy people snuck in from the rooftop and started snatching people.
[250:40.06]I heard a hell of a racket coming from the monitors.
[250:42.48]Where the monitors are.
[250:43.50]So I'm taking advantage.
[250:45.72]I might not look the type, but I've got a small aircraft pilot's license.
[250:49.72]I haven't seen Jessie.
[250:50.74]There's no time to look for her now.
[250:51.82]I've got to get out while I'm getting good.
[250:53.26]I hope you don't think I'm a coward.
[250:55.94]If we meet on the other side, I definitely owe you a drink.
[250:58.28]Good luck, Frank.
[251:00.18]Otis Washington.
[251:03.53]Really?
[251:09.36]Helipad?
[251:12.08]Is me and Otis going to just take off?
[251:21.45]I'm out of here.
[251:26.61]Let's go.
[251:32.94]Wait, he ditched me.
[251:34.42]He left?
[251:40.02]What time is it?
[251:48.01]Well, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
[252:01.74]Just... Can I just stand there for 12 hours?
[252:10.89]Yeah, I have until noon.
[252:12.17]Okay, so... I guess I'm just gonna go out here and see what's going on.
[252:25.55]The mall is now my oyster.
[252:31.20]Yes.
[252:33.16]Yes!
[252:34.08]I feel so good.
[252:41.31]Wait, there's people in here now.
[252:44.17]The random dick hit with the katana is not going to stand a chance right here.
[253:12.59]Where is the guy with the katana?
[253:16.29]Oh, fuck.
[253:27.77]What is happening?
[253:28.41]Okay.

[253:40.56]I'll take three of these.
[253:43.00]You know what?
[253:43.68]I'll take four of these.
[253:45.40]Sounds good to me.
[253:58.60]How cool is this to use?
[253:59.44]Pretty cool.
[254:13.66]Alright, I got 11 hours.
[254:15.66]Let's just have, let's play.

[254:31.11]Nectar.
[254:33.15]Still haven't figured out what this does.
[254:34.09]Does it spawn a queen or something?
[254:45.16]Alright, I'm gonna save it.
[254:49.69]Put your cam on?
[254:51.09]I will, when there's one hour remaining.

[255:45.84]Anybody know what that was?
[255:47.40]I didn't see it.
[255:48.22]I just saw it pop up for a quarter of a second.
[256:11.76]Alright, I'm good.
[256:13.28]Now, we're gonna go up to Isabelle.
[256:16.36]And see what the hell she has to say.

[262:22.58]I have to be back here at 10 AM.
[262:27.68]Nothing's changed at all.
[262:28.94]They never admit when they're at fault.
[262:29.94]They didn't at Santa Cabeza.
[262:31.06]They won't now.
[262:33.80]She's right.
[262:34.22]If we die here, the evidence will be covered up and the truth will stay in the shadows forever.
[262:37.22]Nothing will change.
[262:40.42]That's why we've got to survive.
[262:41.40]We'll let the military do their work, then make our move.
[262:47.90]All right.
[262:49.06]What time is it right now?

[263:12.94]So then just hang out... Just survive until 10 a.m.

[263:18.93]And then by 12, be back on the helipad.
[263:26.25]Got it.
[263:29.95]So in the meantime... I have... I have time to... I don't even know what the hell I want to do.

[281:25.66]Corn and zucchini?
[281:30.45]Hmm.
[281:34.27]Corn and orange juice.
[281:35.87]Wine and corn.
[281:38.85]Corn and corn.
[281:41.42]Let's do corn and orange juice.
[281:44.14]It's a nectar.
[281:55.13]How about zucchini and corn?
[282:06.63]That's different.
[282:08.05]Spitfire.
[282:08.71]I still don't even know what this does.
[282:10.83]How about... We have an ingredient in here.
[282:15.00]How about flour and orange juice?
[282:20.10]Okay.
[282:31.40]Vector.
[282:32.74]How about... That's a big knife.
[282:41.67]I got enough.
[282:53.03]Okay, I can get two guns.
[282:58.96]Knife and chainsaw.
[283:01.60]That's not how this works.
[283:03.92]Alright, so I have wine and... I gotta do one other thing.
[283:07.25]There's gotta be one other ingredient lying around somewhere, like right here.
[283:10.14]There we go.
[283:10.54]Wine and corn.
[283:31.60]Cast, register, and gun.
[283:34.38]Ooh, there we go.
[283:35.20]There's a quick step.
[283:36.06]That's very useful.
[283:39.68]Energizer.
[283:45.05]Although... So I got one, two, three, four, five full heals, two super chainsaws, and... a huge amount of guns.
[283:58.67]And we got six o'clock, I got a couple hours...
[284:04.60]I'm going to make my way back.
[284:06.53]I'm going to go back to Isabella.
[284:10.23]Because that's the right thing to do.
[284:12.15]Because it's going to take me a little while to get up there.
[284:16.77]Straight up.
[284:17.57]Save the game.
[284:18.34]Up there.
[284:26.36]If there's a place to get shoes, I will get them.
[284:30.63]They have to be actually on the way.
[284:33.15]I'm gonna replace this cleaver, by the way.
[284:34.63]I actually don't even have a cleaver.
[284:37.04]Never mind.
[284:41.12]Shoes.
[284:41.87]Casual gals.
[285:01.43]There may have been somebody in here at one point.
[285:09.13]Shoes of a lifetime.
[285:16.44]I can't take any of these shoes.
[285:26.00]Alright.
[285:27.72]Save point.
[285:32.46]I went to two shoe stores.
[285:34.16]Am I hitting the wall?
[286:00.19]That's the threat.
[286:01.91]That's what you should have been shooting at.
[286:03.35]Good work.
[286:03.73]The zombie walking around at one mile per hour was the real threat.
[286:08.43]Not the guy unloading a full magazine into your body.
[286:12.18]These guys are great.
[286:14.04]Shoes!
[286:22.18]There's no shoes.
[286:26.16]No shoes.
[286:28.34]I'm sorry, guys.
[286:33.95]save point right here all right all the way at the top the first one is the real save point I have to go to the dressing room yeah but doesn't take off all my clothes I don't want to lose my red dyed hair in my white suit
[287:11.42]Leave me alone.
[287:15.31]I got the... Now this is going to be great.
[287:18.35]Check this out.
[287:22.55]Actually, I don't want to use any heals at the moment.
[287:24.21]I'm going to slow down.
[287:30.94]So I'm going to get the motorcycle and ride it back.
[287:37.31]That should be good, right?
[287:48.12]In fact, I'm just gonna go in the grocery store and just drink orange juice until it's time to go.
[287:51.04]That sounds like a pretty good idea right now.
[288:08.23]No military?
[288:09.03]Just making sure there's no military.
[288:10.02]Okay, there are military, but they're not here.
[288:15.62]Whatever, let's go.
[288:21.24]Alright, I gotta get in the corner here.
[288:34.43]Can I just break?
[288:35.63]I just scared the shit out of me.
[288:43.73]There's a lot more in here.
[288:44.57]I gotta get a gun.
[288:48.89]Where are they?
[288:50.03]Two more coming down the aisle.
[288:51.92]There.
[289:02.36]Uh-oh!
[289:20.93]Gun.
[289:23.67]Where's the other gun?
[289:29.87]I killed him, like, up here.
[289:32.71]Come on.
[289:32.89]Where's the machine gun?
[289:33.45]Hurry up!
[289:33.89]Come on!
[289:35.77]Here we go.
[289:37.18]Oh.
[289:46.40]You bitch!
[289:47.26]Get out of my way!
[290:01.08]Oh, fuck me.
[290:06.36]No, don't you dare!
[290:33.27]Where is this other guy, this military dude?
[290:41.64]There's two over here.
[290:55.05]Dead.
[290:55.43]Alright.
[290:55.97]Is that it?
[290:56.77]Do I have this whole place to myself?
[290:57.95]Alright.
[291:07.59]Now I'm just gonna eat bread until I shit my pants.
[291:38.49]Alright, done.
[291:41.98]I do want, like, two more orange juices.
[291:43.78]Raw meat.
[291:49.82]I'm worse than a zombie right now.
[291:51.24]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[292:07.24]The plan is to leave here with two machine guns.
[292:11.81]Take an orange juice.
[292:12.41]Just want to test it.
[292:18.09]So, replace.
[292:22.29]Give me... I need a better one than this.
[292:25.31]All right, there we go.
[292:26.75]Good.
[292:27.99]What do we got for time?
[292:28.85]Seven, almost eight.
[292:29.57]Uh-oh.
[292:31.09]It's getting to be late.
[292:46.41]I need a machine gun with 150.
[292:50.03]150 in both?
[292:50.81]Good.
[292:54.89]Alright.
[292:55.79]Motorcycle time.
[292:58.17]And it's time to go to Isabella.
[293:03.67]The motorcycle actually will not be there when I get back.
[293:06.07]Will it?
[293:09.63]So... Hmm.
[293:14.35]Try jump.
[293:30.98]How do I not do the down stop?
[293:33.63]I want someone to explain it to me.
[293:34.91]Right, that's what I usually say.
[293:36.03]Alright.
[293:55.16]I'm here.
[293:56.24]I'm gonna save it.
[293:57.82]And then we're just gonna... Hang on.
[294:03.99]I'm at the end game.
[294:04.91]I'm almost at the finale.
[294:18.12]Eight o'clock.
[294:26.41]Face cam.
[294:27.89]I will.
[294:28.75]Let me take this opportunity.
[294:29.37]I'm going to go pee one more time.
[294:30.23]I'll be right back.
[294:33.83]You can just watch the clock.
[294:35.40]I'll be back by 9.
[296:39.13]See?
[296:39.25]I thought you'd be back before 9.
[296:58.13]This is kind of nice, actually.
[296:59.95]I've been so up against the clock that all I have to do now is just wait.
[297:07.92]We want hair content.
[297:16.79]Can you imagine somebody telling you, hey, can you meet me back here at 10 a.m.?
[297:23.99]You say, yeah, that sounds like a plan.
[297:26.11]I sure will meet you here at 10 a.m.
[297:28.43]You go, all right, bye.
[297:29.43]We're going to do lunch.
[297:31.58]And you get... You let go...
[297:39.63]standing outside like the restaurant just going like this for two hours and you show up like five ten minutes early fucking person just standing there going like this you're like hey you want to start early this is like in their own world oh
[298:07.73]Or imagine like, hey, I'll pick you up at 8.
[298:09.90]Or I'll pick you up at 10.
[298:11.64]Meet here.
[298:13.10]And you just stand here and do this?
[298:16.59]Oh my god.
[298:17.33]Okay, 9 AM.
[298:22.01]Wait, can I fight up here?
[298:31.16]When your villagers want to come over in Animal Crossing, you just sit there and just stare at the clock.
[298:37.75]Wash my hair.
[298:38.45]I actually used a different conditioner today and it's like weighing it down.
[298:41.00]I won't be using it again.
[299:00.90]When you talk to her, there's just a normal text box.
[299:03.98]Okay.
[299:07.56]Somebody just gave money.
[299:10.30]Ishanji gave 5,000 bits.
[299:13.80]Thank you, Ishanji.
[299:14.50]And they say, Very... Very... Very... Very good stream today.
[299:21.14]You didn't get flaccid locked at all.
[299:23.06]Terminator 5,000.
[299:23.76]Thank you for the 5,000 bits?
[299:32.46]Thanks for the Terminator bits.
[299:36.96]Is the new Terminator movie good?
[299:42.16]Is it out yet?
[299:48.28]No.
[299:48.72]That was the most unanimous no I think I've ever seen.
[299:53.46]Usually one person in chat will be like, I'm going to be contrarian and say yes.
[299:56.28]I think that was like 600 no's in a row.
[300:01.99]Damn.
[300:06.71]But thank you, Ashanti.
[300:07.69]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, man.
[300:11.79]Wait, I have to go through my photos and see which ones I like.
[300:20.93]You know what I'm saying?
[300:24.82]Delete.
[300:27.92]Hmm.
[300:35.43]This is just terrible.
[300:36.29]This is just I don't like That one's okay.
[300:39.79]This one's better because it's like turned completely upside down It's like when a dog hears a strange noise Or when you start talking to your dog and you start talking in a weird voice Instead of going like hey like Otto you go like hey Otto and they're like what the fuck are you doing?
[301:10.03]They get gamer neck.
[301:12.03]I'm like, hello, Otto, Otto, Otto.
[301:15.18]And he's just like.
[301:22.26]Can somebody tell me what happened?
[301:23.18]I was in the shower and didn't see what happened to her.
[301:25.72]Oh, that's a spoiler.
[301:36.13]It's just blood.
[301:42.93]This is the girl that fell down.
[301:44.03]I actually quite like this.
[301:50.37]I like that one.
[301:54.67]I like this one too.
[301:56.06]I like the guys on the left.
[301:59.20]This is a perfect photo of how the AI in this game is fucking stupid.
[302:07.48]It's every person is doing something else that was aggravating during the course of the game.
[302:14.01]Guy on left just standing, staring blankly, won't move.
[302:17.89]Lady with the sword in the back that has a weapon that's running in a completely opposite direction, scared.
[302:22.46]Person with the gun in the middle that you give the gun to hoping they'll do something.
[302:25.10]They're looking at the sky.
[302:26.88]And the gun is pointed towards the floor.
[302:30.30]Lady in the front is angry and pissed off and won't listen to you.
[302:35.10]And Guy is hiding behind her to not get killed.
[302:41.07]Or, in fact, you know, that person might just be stuck in the middle.
[302:46.16]Keep this one.
[302:46.68]This is my favorite picture of the whole entire game.
[302:50.50]This guy's Peyton Manning?
[302:57.27]Nationwide is on your side.
[303:00.09]There he is again.
[303:11.93]Is that an explosion over there?
[303:13.67]Why is Nathan always just somehow sort of in the picture?
[303:26.75]It's like he doesn't want to be on camera.
[303:28.59]He's like dodging.
[303:32.49]Keep that one for sure.
[303:33.51]Keep them both.
[303:34.19]I like this one because this is this is like me and you decided to do like a shoot.
[303:39.63]And I'm doing different angles and telling you to do the same pose.
[303:48.24]I'll keep Ronald.
[303:55.56]Keep the mirror.
[304:05.92]Keep, okay, keep, like, the transition into pants.
[304:11.10]No, this is just a dream he's having.
[304:12.86]Alright, I want to keep, like, the dream.
[304:21.46]Rock bottom off the titantron, absolutely.
[304:24.66]And... I've had this one since the very beginning.
[304:28.21]And it's the first, like, photo I took.
[304:34.31]I think those are keepers.
[304:37.51]I kept this one, right?
[304:38.17]Yep.
[304:43.06]Take that.
[304:43.44]Wait.
[304:43.80]Do I... I might need it.
[304:44.50]No, I don't.
[304:44.94]The game's over.
[304:48.36]Okay.
[304:49.70]Did I just burn some time or was it paused?
[304:51.61]Am I going to play Dead Rising 2?
[304:56.93]I would say at this point, absolutely yes.
[305:09.06]We'll see where we can fit it in over the next, like, month or so.
[305:13.28]Dead Rising 2 sucks.
[305:16.82]I don't remember it being bad.
[305:18.56]Although I did only play, like, two or three hours of it.
[305:23.83]That's a one guy.
[305:24.49]That actually kind of was a one guy opinion.
[305:26.91]Yeah, you're right.
[305:33.93]I hope you guys weren't lying to me, and I hope this isn't really actually going to happen.
[305:38.05]What about Dead Rising 3?
[305:40.57]Uh... Once we go past 2, we're really gonna have to see if people are just exhausted with Dead Rising.
[305:47.17]I'm gonna try to break them up to a point where it doesn't happen immediately.
[305:50.72]But... I don't remember Dead Rising 3 being very good.
[305:55.52]That's when they made the change to, like, new generations, right?
[305:59.22]Like Xbox One.
[306:07.18]Three is meh, four is bad.
[306:08.42]I remember playing one of them, maybe even on stream.
[306:13.54]I think I did stream the fourth one.
[306:16.69]I'm getting, like, these weird flashbacks of actually playing the fourth one on stream.
[306:22.19]I made a video on the third game, but the fourth one, though?
[306:26.58]I remember there was a guy, like, you have, like, this machine gun.
[306:31.89]And there's a person up on like a rafter and you're shooting like a minigun at them.
[306:36.11]And I remember saying this game sucks.
[306:40.49]I remember being like this is fucking stupid.
[306:42.73]This is terrible.
[306:44.63]At that moment is what I remember.
[306:49.64]That's four.
[306:50.40]Okay.
[306:54.16]Almost time.
[306:59.47]You made a video on the fourth one as well.
[307:02.15]Maybe that was, like, one of the last... Yeah.
[307:05.23]I just don't remember.
[307:06.61]I remember, like... Whether it was a video or a stream, I just remember doing it.
[307:12.64]Save it right here.
[307:18.74]Never played this one, though, all the way through.
[307:19.94]Oh, I'm gonna go all the way to the bottom.
[307:28.69]I wonder if they'll do a Dead Rising 5.
[307:31.37]After people were just like, meh.
[307:33.19]Like, eh, the last two weren't very good.
[307:35.01]I wonder if we'll get another one.
[307:39.57]You can't throw stuff in Dead Rising 4.
[307:41.17]Now that's a reason to just refund the game immediately when you get it.
[307:52.10]Maybe we'll get a... Like, back to formula, Dead Rising 5.
[307:58.24]That'd be kind of cool.
[308:05.44]Have they talked about it at all?
[308:06.39]Almost ten.
[308:16.40]Alright, I'm ready.
[308:17.62]I got the face cam on for the final leg fight.
[308:25.82]4 was basically a soft reboot and they fucked it up.
[308:28.12]Yeah.
[308:29.00]That's unfortunate.
[308:32.45]They advertised 4 as back to formula.
[308:35.43]Here we go.
[308:40.57]And?
[308:49.07]Two hours.
[308:56.31]Well, that's kind of what they're saying with, like, Diablo 4.
[308:59.27]And... I mean, that game's, like, four years out, probably.
[309:06.15]Hey, we're going back to, like, you remember Diablo 2.
[309:09.17]You loved Diablo 2.
[309:10.61]Remember how dark and scary it was and how much blood there was?
[309:13.74]It's like... I mean, yeah, I kind of...
[309:21.92]you loved that game and we're gonna go back there it's like well okay we'll see what you do in five years when it comes out all right 10 a.m let's go it's almost time don't worry about me save yourself
[309:53.10]Is that... That's what I had to do?
[309:59.79]To the helipad, now.
[310:08.03]Alright, I'm gonna grab motorcycle, and I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
[310:16.36]Can I go there?
[310:17.06]What's the fastest way?
[310:17.80]Straighten and straight.
[310:21.02]You had to do this or else a guy doesn't show up.
[310:24.71]Seems a little strange.
[310:27.73]Alright, motorcycle.
[310:29.27]Give it to me.
[310:35.59]One guy?
[310:36.11]That was definitely not one guy telling me to talk to her at 10am.
[310:42.10]If by one guy you mean like one collective group of humans that were all in this chat at the same time.
[310:51.96]Please tell me the motorcycle is still there.
[310:53.16]It is.
[310:53.94]The lights are all on.
[310:54.80]Alright, let's go.
[311:01.73]So we're going to go straight out this way.
[311:07.95]Yeah, just around the corner.
[311:12.84]Okay, straight.
[311:15.62]And then through the park.
[311:22.00]Uh, is it this way, right?
[311:24.18]Yeah.
[311:33.34]Okay.
[311:35.28]Can I leave here with this?
[311:39.43]I can't, can I?
[311:42.33]Oh, that's stupid.
[311:43.63]Alright, whatever.
[311:44.19]At least it took me far.
[311:50.23]It took me far.
[311:53.07]Bang a left.
[311:55.93]Yeah, no song.
[311:57.11]Everything's dead and no song.
[312:03.83]I'll save it too before I go through.
[312:16.49]Nice and sunny out though.
[312:18.72]That's a good thing.
[312:25.25]All right.
[312:26.11]And then it's straight this way.
[312:29.95]I'm going to save it right here.
[312:40.18]Shoes.
[312:42.94]No shoes in there.
[312:43.64]No shoes in there.
[312:44.30]It has to be on the way.
[312:53.69]I can't put on anything.
[312:54.85]I can't... What am I trying to do?
[312:56.17]Alright, we got a save point right here.
[313:08.51]That was literally a shoe store.
[313:11.67]The old toy box and toys for children?
[313:27.13]They're on.
[313:29.71]First time I've worn shoes.
[313:33.79]All game.
[313:37.41]Now I'm ready to absolutely destroy the end of this game.
[313:45.15]One hour.
[313:46.03]Let's go.
[313:46.41]To the helipad.
[314:00.34]Just a clean run.
[314:01.38]That's good.
[314:02.78]Although I kind of want some... Well, I should be fine.
[314:07.30]Is there food?
[314:07.72]There's a box right here with food in it, right?
[314:13.03]Eh.
[314:14.25]Not very good food, but it's something.
[314:15.55]Let's go.
[314:19.51]Am I going to play Luigi's Mansion 3?
[314:25.89]Hmm.
[314:27.73]Hmm.
[314:33.65]Probably not.
[314:35.47]Not on stream, at least.
[314:39.01]Actually, I can save it here, too.
[314:42.65]Any more notes?
[314:45.62]No.
[314:45.74]I mean, it looks alright.
[314:53.06]It looks fun.
[314:54.48]But I hadn't played, really, the first or the second one.
[314:59.32]So, I'd be, like, kind of just jumping in to the third game, and I... It's not that I don't want to play it.
[315:06.47]Okay, that's good.
[315:09.59]Now let's go up.
[315:11.11]Which way is it?
[315:11.53]This way?
[315:15.87]Where the hell do I get up?
[315:20.94]Oh, there we go.
[315:24.76]Here we go!
[315:29.71]11 o'clock!
[315:32.25]I'm here.
[315:32.89]I'm ready for the helicopter to pick me up.
[315:50.02]I missed it.
[315:50.46]No, I didn't.
[315:52.54]It said an hour.
[316:01.18]11.01.
[316:02.46]I did miss it.
[316:05.56]No emotion for one hour.
[316:24.76]Nice to be a weirdo.
[316:26.16]Nice kill count.
[316:26.94]3,412.
[316:27.08]That's not good for just a one-off playthrough.
[316:33.06]I do have lots of heals, though.
[316:34.36]I should be fine.
[316:35.84]It's because of Daylight Savings Time.
[316:40.74]I'm just going to hide up here.
[316:43.24]Do I have to be physically standing on the helipad?
[316:51.45]Yes.
[316:51.81]Alright, I'm going to go right in the middle of the H.
[316:53.15]1120.
[316:53.17]Okay.
[317:20.72]Actually, that is like a stupid thing I just did, but it's not.
[318:00.19]An actual, like, organized inventory.
[318:01.51]You know what I mean?
[318:03.67]So I can act like, oh, melee!
[318:05.55]I'm not cycling all over the place to find stuff.
[318:09.73]And it's categorized.
[318:16.24]Juices aren't organized next to each other.
[318:21.70]I did type and then color.
[318:32.50]No, that looks much better than it being... No, it's like four orange in a row, and then white, and then dark blue.
[318:42.10]Opposite ends of the color spectrum?
[318:44.14]You guys don't know color theory?
[318:48.64]Okay.
[318:54.73]Fifteen minutes.
[319:00.77]Slime him.
[319:01.31]He said orange.
[319:04.59]Not today.
[319:12.05]Alright.
[319:12.85]What would it take for me to throw all my items over the edge?
[319:19.68]Just throw all my healing and just throw everything over the fence.
[319:32.40]Don't do it.
[319:33.75]Alright, I'll throw one orange juice.
[319:42.09]There's no way this... Don't!
[319:46.35]Don't do it!
[319:47.09]Don't do it!
[319:47.81]I'm gonna throw the orange juice over the cliff.
[319:53.52]I have five minutes to decide if I'm gonna throw the orange juice.
[320:10.56]One.
[320:11.52]Two.
[320:35.87]Did I do it?
[320:36.33]I did it!
[320:40.94]Where's the helicopter?
[320:49.96]It's gonna be Otis.
[320:59.15]The archer just gets thrown back over.
[321:03.13]That son of a bitch made it.
[321:06.55]That must mean he got his scoop.
[321:09.00]Let's go.
[321:09.42]Boom!
[321:09.72]Missile.
[321:41.30]Right?
[321:41.72]That's what happens in these games.
[321:55.05]This is the setup for his death.
[322:01.24]It's over.
[322:01.68]He's gonna get shot down.
[322:02.88]I knew it.
[322:05.04]I told you.
[322:05.76]I knew it.
[322:10.50]Do I have to fly the helicopter?
[322:13.62]Way too much celebrating before anything, you know what I mean?
[322:15.58]Way too much, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, good, yeah, oh yeah!
[322:19.56]Yeah!
[322:20.46]Yeah!
[322:21.27]That, you don't, that, it's over, I lose.
[322:31.83]Way too much, yeah, here we go!
[322:34.46]Like, get your hands on the wheel!
[322:47.14]I don't know.
[322:47.48]Something was in my view.
[322:48.72]Something got distracted me.
[322:51.00]It looked like an orange.
[322:55.54]Did I actually lose?
[323:01.08]So the whole game is based around the helicopter pilot doesn't get bit by a fucking zombie at the last 30 seconds?
[323:15.35]I don't get out.
[323:19.05]What?
[323:24.50]Yeah!
[323:26.04]Nice work, everybody!
[323:28.81]Wait a minute!
[323:30.75]The guy from stage right is gonna bite me!
[323:34.43]You wasted three days!
[323:49.78]We told you not to throw the orange juice.
[323:54.68]It's not over, I have overtime.
[323:58.82]What, they're gonna get another helicopter?
[324:01.86]What did you do?
[324:03.98]I didn't do anything!
[324:23.63]It's not the end, really.
[324:27.73]That's so funny.
[324:34.44]This five endings, you just got the Brad ending, but this ain't bad.
[325:07.08]That is the canon ending.
[325:13.36]Why didn't you get more erotic points?
[325:25.79]Does it count how many pictures like how many points I had?
[325:35.95]German's a prude.
[325:38.01]No, I took plenty of photos.
[325:40.30]We'll just put it that way.
[325:47.44]You did great, German.
[325:48.20]I'm proud of you.
[325:48.68]Thank you.
[325:50.08]Alright.
[325:52.78]There's more?
[325:53.24]Alright, let's see.
[326:02.51]I'm willing to give it a... keep going.
[326:11.59]Oh, by the way.
[326:12.09]Now we need content.
[326:33.72]I wish you could see the faces I'm making right now into the camera.
[326:39.99]Nope.
[326:48.61]Okay, exclamation point, turn on cam.
[326:52.69]It's gonna be an actual, a new command that if it happens 50,000 fucking times, the webcam will turn on.
[327:12.24]Oh, you guys are really hammering this, huh?
[327:15.88]Alright, hey, hey!
[327:19.29]PP earned.
[327:19.95]2 million.
[327:22.25]Ending A. Bonus.
[327:25.40]50,000 PP.
[327:25.96]Zombie kill count.
[327:27.48]15,000 PP.
[327:28.58]Photo score.
[327:29.32]Bonus.
[327:29.78]Bonus current.
[327:30.88]I just got a lot of... Survivor chart.
[327:37.88]Am I playing Guess Who?
[327:47.29]Brad is up there.
[327:54.29]Barnaby's up there.
[327:55.63]Barnaby can survive too.
[327:58.75]Who made it?
[328:01.01]Tad.
[328:06.33]Alyssa, Jonathan, and Brad.
[328:07.93]All dead.
[328:09.71]And, if I'm honest, good.
[328:11.17]Good.
[328:15.53]I don't remember coming... Oh, Ronald dead.
[328:22.70]Wait, why am I dead?
[328:24.78]I'm dead.
[328:25.86]Frank is dead.
[328:27.06]What?
[328:28.09]What?
[328:28.93]I'm dead?
[328:29.49]How did I die?
[328:40.91]Brutality, 29.
[328:42.85]Drama, 44.
[328:44.25]Erotica, 8.
[328:48.65]I'll take one.
[328:50.31]Horror, 76.
[328:51.70]I didn't take any.
[328:58.06]That's funny.
[328:59.22]End?
[329:00.74]Special Forces boots have been added to the security room.
[329:04.51]Overtime mode has been added to the title screen.
[329:08.28]Choose save game slot and save Frank's status.
[329:10.60]When you begin a new game, you can play with Frank's current status.
[329:16.41]I got, I unlocked shoes.
[329:47.71]Wait.
[329:51.91]What's the matter with me?
[330:06.62]Oh no, he's been up here!
[330:07.98]He's been up here for two days and he's only had orange juice!
[330:14.09]Why didn't you bring any meat or any vegetables?
[330:21.29]And what's that I see over the balcony?
[330:22.92]A full orange juice.
[330:30.22]It wasn't easy getting you back here by myself, you know.
[330:33.52]All right, Frank's still alive.
[330:34.42]You collapsed on the roof.
[330:40.95]I collapsed?
[330:44.77]No, I... Wait.
[330:51.70]What does that mean?
[330:52.49]Why would I not remember this?
[330:58.31]Didn't this happen like 42 minutes ago?
[331:02.91]The orange juice overdose?
[331:05.49]Orange juice hangover.
[331:06.69]I don't know.
[331:08.20]I just don't remember.
[331:09.34]You... You must have gotten yourself infected somehow.
[331:27.88]That's the way every character laughs before they do something insane.
[331:30.98]The time between infection and zombification differs greatly from person to person.
[331:35.55]You're lucky, Frank.
[331:38.11]You seem to have a very high level of resistance.
[331:42.93]So... So what you're saying...
[331:49.01]is that I get to spend longer waiting for the inevitable.
[331:52.74]Is that it?
[331:57.90]You know, I'm not sure lucky is the word I'd use.
[332:05.69]I can't wait to get the super boots.
[332:09.41]Are they there now?
[332:10.19]Or do I have to actually go to a different game mode?
[332:16.50]The helicopter crashed.
[332:22.75]No one's coming to help us now.
[332:33.04]It's over for us.
[332:36.49]No matter what we do.
[332:48.04]I can't believe that I unlocked Super Shoes.
[332:52.68]The game was taunting me.
[332:56.35]What if there was some way to impede the infection?
[332:58.81]I feel like you guys made that happen.
[333:03.55]If we could extract and administer a large dose of hormones from the corpus allatum of an adult queen, it would potentially hinder the growth of the larvae in your blood, retarding the zombification process.
[333:14.86]Hang on a sec.
[333:16.35]I don't understand a word you just said.
[333:19.23]What are we supposed to do?
[333:20.83]I'll need certain supplies to get this to work.
[333:23.29]And queens.
[333:23.71]How many queens?
[333:25.23]As many as you can get your hands on.
[333:27.41]All right.
[333:29.37]Can you say, like, eight?
[333:32.15]All right.
[333:36.23]Sounds like a plan.
[333:38.81]Should be sitting around here waiting to die.
[333:48.68]Did time go backwards?
[333:55.83]24 hours remain until frank zombification.
[334:01.27]What do you mean 24 hours remain?
[334:02.59]Alright, I gotta... That's 33, all the way at the bottom.
[334:28.11]So I have to do this.
[334:30.95]What in the name of God is going on here?
[334:36.70]First aid kit, blender, coffee filters, magnet.
[334:40.51]Let's go.
[335:07.65]Alright.
[335:08.27]Cold spray.
[335:11.87]Where are... Okay, let me see where these all are.
[335:14.75]I'm gonna stay.
[335:15.40]We're going grocery store down, and we're gonna wrap around a complete circle, and we're going here.
[335:20.16]This way.
[335:22.02]Grocery store first.
[335:23.22]Bang a left.
[335:31.07]What is this?
[335:33.47]This is not overtime.
[335:34.29]This is...
[335:36.47]There are drones.
[335:38.55]No.
[336:04.44]Wonderful.
[336:08.82]Are they military too?
[336:13.17]There is.
[336:13.77]It's just military and drones for the rest of the game.
[336:18.51]I'm getting the motorcycle and just driving around.
[336:39.97]I hear a drone, I hear a drone, I hear a drone!
[336:42.09]How do I stop the drone?
[336:50.30]Holy shit, that was really easy.
[336:56.28]Alright, go.
[336:57.64]I need to go into the grocery store, turn around.
[337:04.77]And then I'm gonna go down with the motorcycle.
[337:10.10]What if I just don't even care?
[337:11.48]Just run.
[337:15.16]Ooh.
[337:27.91]I gotta kill this guy.
[337:39.28]Get in.
[337:40.12]The motorcycle's still here.
[337:41.12]Alright.
[337:43.93]What is actually in this, though?
[337:50.07]Oh, man.
[337:50.43]We're...
[338:08.60]I'm a pain in the ass.
[338:09.34]Because there's no better way to kill these guys than just to unload like this.
[338:17.88]Alright, what am I looking for?
[338:21.64]A chainsaw?
[338:25.45]But they'll shoot me.
[338:26.39]Alright, pharmacy.
[338:33.93]Oh, motherfucker.
[338:34.59]Come on.
[338:39.55]Save the chainsaws?
[338:41.39]Yeah.
[338:42.79]I think so too.
[338:45.65]Okay.
[338:46.01]First aid kit.
[338:46.73]There it is.
[338:47.07]You obtained first aid kit.
[338:47.95]Keep going.
[338:48.35]Grab motorcycle.
[338:52.10]Go straight down into the jewelry store.
[338:55.94]It's as easy as that.
[339:16.39]Emergency backup!
[339:17.35]This is gonna fill up.
[339:24.67]I'm gonna drink the milk and get an orange juice and then leave.
[339:28.71]In fact, get two orange juices.
[339:44.60]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[339:52.78]Level up.
[339:55.60]More attack power?
[339:59.26]Attack increased 200%!
[340:00.58]Does that include guns, too?
[340:07.64]That sounds like a lot.
[340:12.14]Alright, take another orange juice.
[340:14.60]Two is fine.
[340:15.72]Let's go.
[340:29.11]I got plenty of time.
[340:32.96]So the idea is just to go bang a right and go straight down.
[340:36.12]Hopefully keep the motorcycle with me as long as I can.
[340:49.07]And then where's this next one?
[340:53.68]Down or up?
[340:55.24]Looks like it's just to the right.
[341:08.51]Guys, just looking at necklaces is good.
[341:09.81]Alright, what are we looking for?
[341:19.31]Right there, magnifying glass.
[341:20.58]Got it.
[341:26.64]Um, you're gonna think I'm crazy for this, but I'm not gonna save the game.
[341:33.26]Because I'll lose a bike.
[341:45.92]I'm gonna save the game when I'm at the last place.
[341:48.17]Alright, food court.
[341:49.87]Straight ahead.
[341:56.25]Blender.
[342:05.46]I can't make any more drinks.
[342:06.42]Keep going.
[342:11.84]Come out out of here.
[342:13.08]Wrap around.
[342:22.13]Alright, I think I have to lose the motorcycle.
[342:25.63]Yep.
[342:26.39]I think... Yeah, I do.
[342:27.67]Go straight through.
[342:29.25]Down the entrance plaza.
[342:34.00]Pick up the bike.
[342:36.40]I can't pick it up.
[342:43.37]Okay, now I've got a save point to the right.
[342:45.61]I'm gonna use it.
[342:52.41]Oh, he's dead for some reason.
[342:59.81]Cool.
[343:03.38]Quick step?
[343:03.92]Not yet.
[343:04.72]I don't need it.
[343:13.19]Where's the drone?
[343:13.87]I can hear it.
[343:18.01]Where's the drone?
[343:18.61]There it is.
[343:30.50]Not reaching?
[343:31.18]Nah.
[343:37.14]Get on the treadmill.
[343:37.92]Get on the treadmill.
[343:38.54]Get on the...
[343:58.05]Got it.
[343:58.29]There's nothing in here.
[344:04.19]It's all in the entrance plaza.
[344:13.16]Essentially not as bad as it could have been.
[344:16.04]So this is just a way for you to just keep playing and messing around.
[344:18.69]That's kind of cool.
[344:21.75]Although the one thing I would say is...
[344:32.75]Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
[344:37.35]Not a chainsaw, drink.
[344:48.59]Oh, it's two hits.
[344:49.81]You gotta be kidding me.
[344:55.78]You gotta get real close, though.
[344:57.36]Alright, um...
[344:59.88]I get to replace it.
[345:01.62]That's so awesome.
[345:02.36]That makes me so happy.
[345:05.76]It's like I didn't even do anything.
[345:12.95]Let's go.
[345:24.43]22 hours until zombification.
[345:26.26]I guess... There's a couple places here.
[345:35.87]Drones?
[345:37.41]I hear it.
[345:41.21]Where are you?
[345:46.09]This one's definitely up.
[345:46.91]If they took inventory slots, this would be pretty much impossible.
[345:58.97]It wouldn't be actually impossible, but it would be sort of impossible.
[346:07.52]Alright, where is this up here?
[346:10.59]Cosmetics.
[346:13.33]There it is.
[346:14.87]Perfume.
[346:18.45]And then straight down.
[346:20.03]There's a save point in there too.
[346:25.12]Who cut the lights?
[346:30.20]Gotta go all the way down.
[346:32.85]All the way.
[346:38.10]Oh, my little fetch quest.
[346:39.70]I actually would rather there be zombies.
[346:49.24]Because these guys are annoying.
[346:51.78]But their danger only actually comes out if there's more than two or three of them all aiming at you at the same time.
[346:57.96]They just sort of walk in straight lines.
[347:06.59]Where is this person?
[347:11.09]So they're like a zombie.
[347:13.59]Yeah, but these guys can do, like, four... cheese slices of health.
[347:20.27]In one second.
[347:21.95]Takes a lot longer for a zombie to do that.
[347:23.27]Alright, this door right here, and then right across the street.
[347:34.15]What is it?
[347:36.79]Tie?
[347:38.02]Shirt?
[347:39.28]In the back room.
[347:42.57]Yeah, just be glad they can't grab you.
[347:44.16]That's true.
[347:47.40]That would suck.
[347:51.35]Am I in the wrong store?
[347:54.93]Is it below me?
[347:55.55]I think it's below me.
[348:13.12]Groomins?
[348:20.44]Hammer.
[348:23.84]A bicycle?
[348:26.46]How have I not found this at all this whole time?
[348:31.66]What am I looking for?
[348:37.43]Did I get distracted by the bicycle?
[348:43.09]What was it?
[348:44.03]It's right here.
[348:44.53]What is it?
[348:50.57]The shelves?
[348:52.62]Camp stove.
[348:53.70]Okay.
[348:53.94]Give me the bike.
[349:06.63]This is going to end very badly.
[349:15.71]Can I jump?
[349:22.44]Alright, it's the one, it's upstairs.
[349:32.36]Can I ride up the stairs?
[349:35.63]Come on, you off-road, let's do it!
[349:46.64]Like the 7-11?
[349:47.86]Which one?
[349:52.90]Someone behind me.
[350:01.97]Where the fuck is it trying to get me to go?
[350:04.23]The exit door?
[350:05.93]Oh, fuck!
[350:06.85]I didn't even know they were up here.
[350:25.01]I'm going here, I guess.
[350:42.18]So it's in the security room.
[350:52.76]In fact, I should probably put it as Cold Spray Coffee Filters Developing Solution.
[351:01.18]Oh, like a developing solution.
[351:02.60]Not the solution for what you're trying to do is currently developing.
[351:14.71]Where's this trying to get me to go?
[351:30.39]It's a coffee filter?
[351:31.47]It's right here.
[351:35.81]Coffee filters.
[351:36.51]Where are the boots?
[351:37.69]Are they right there?
[351:39.97]Oh, I lost my clothes.
[351:44.56]Are they behind the vent?
[352:00.81]Where?
[352:05.42]Go back?
[352:12.22]They have to be in another save.
[352:13.80]Speaking of saving... Have to be in the new game?
[352:21.18]That's alright.
[352:27.24]no no no no no what do you mean no do you see boots I don't there's lockers back here yeah well that's all right I'm glad with this I'll take my grandma's rug yeah oh but what about the red one I got a red hair yeah oh the snake
[353:03.12]Alright, good.
[353:11.21]No, this is just default.
[353:12.95]That's what I had on.
[353:22.46]And new glasses.
[353:23.60]Hmm.
[353:30.48]My hair.
[353:30.92]Fuck, it's alright.
[353:31.68]I'll just go with the grandma rug.
[353:40.55]Well, I don't see them anywhere.
[353:44.35]I do not think they're here.
[353:50.11]So, let's go.
[353:51.39]I have 24 hours to live.
[353:52.49]I don't really care about my hair color right now.
[353:58.27]Under the table.
[354:04.24]Lockers behind the stairs.
[354:08.10]I just used these.
[354:09.80]I just did all this.
[354:14.55]Alright, I'm out of here.
[354:15.67]I'm leaving.
[354:16.23]Where are the last two?
[354:24.98]There's one right here somewhere, and then there's one down.
[354:31.10]Uh, Cold Spray Developing Solution.
[354:32.90]It's the camera store.
[354:34.28]It's the other one.
[354:35.66]So let's do Cold Spray.
[354:39.46]Reload.
[354:40.12]Re.
[354:41.81]Re-load.
[354:42.51]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[354:55.83]Wait, is it in here?
[354:56.47]Oh, this is actually not good.
[355:09.07]Wait, don't I need Queens?
[355:16.78]Oh shit, I need Queens.
[355:40.05]Cold spray.
[355:43.31]In the skateboarding store?
[355:44.63]Really?
[355:44.89]That's stupid.
[355:49.81]Okay, all of a sudden it's like a party in here now.
[355:57.81]Okay.
[356:05.56]Any queens?
[356:12.69]Alright, only one more thing to get.
[356:13.73]It's below me.
[356:22.89]It's the camera store, and it's developing solution.
[356:25.62]Let's go.
[356:37.42]Camera!
[356:39.18]Hey!
[356:40.40]No, next one.
[356:50.35]Got a ball.
[356:52.40]Alright.
[356:54.40]Let's finish this.
[356:58.50]Now I gotta get back to up here.
[357:07.33]What's the fastest route?
[357:09.55]Wonderland up?
[357:11.23]Yeah.
[357:17.37]Bathroom shortcut.
[357:28.25]Well, I'm guaranteed at least two queens.
[357:30.54]At least.
[357:44.10]Yep.
[357:47.36]Watch out, I don't want to get swarmed here.
[357:50.00]So now, I just bang right and go straight up.
[358:06.19]On to part two.
[358:15.73]I hate this new outfit.
[358:18.33]This looks uncomfortable.
[358:20.65]I know what this feels like.
[358:21.77]It's gonna be itchy and hairy and spiky at the same time.
[358:27.59]I'm gonna get some more juices.
[358:33.99]Is this even worth doing?
[358:38.47]It's not.
[358:49.34]Straight on.
[358:59.16]Tap the button, then go straight on.
[359:12.55]I brought the ingredients.
[359:17.45]Help me.
[359:18.33]Help me.
[359:19.03]Help me.
[359:19.99]Help me.
[359:26.28]I just dump them all.
[359:27.54]I open up my giant fucking dad smoking jacket and they all fall out.
[359:34.11]So, this drug that stops the parasite growth...
[359:44.14]Have you ever made it before, or is it just a theory?
[359:47.20]When I was working in the medical lab, my brother asked me to research a method of suppressing the parasite.
[359:52.89]Of course, back then, we didn't extract the hormones directly.
[359:56.25]We synthesized them in the lab.
[360:01.85]So, he was looking to protect himself from his own terrorist scheme.
[360:07.22]He wanted a way out, is that it?
[360:08.76]I don't know!
[360:12.80]This is ugly.
[360:37.82]The whole thing is this... I could handle the jacket if the pants were different.
[360:42.30]It just looks like I got run over by a car.
[360:48.70]I have, like, tire tracks all over me.
[360:51.60]I got run over by 15 cars in a row.
[360:54.42]A parasite will develop as it normally would, continuing the zombification process.
[361:05.11]Fat lot of good that does me.
[361:12.79]bad couch.
[361:16.04]Yeah, not just a bad couch, a couch that's sitting at the end of somebody's driveway that just says free on it.
[361:34.61]What happens to all those free couches that nobody takes?
[361:37.35]They just go all to the same place, huh?
[361:40.59]Into the landfill?
[361:41.45]Yeah, uh... Listen.
[361:49.15]Just how long do you suppose your drug will prevent me from turning into a walking corpse?
[361:53.95]During my research, I was never able to conduct proper clinical studies.
[361:57.42]To a certain extent, the period of effectiveness depends on each patient's physiology.
[362:06.27]Maybe only a week.
[362:07.21]There's no way to tell for sure.
[362:11.53]They're skinned for suits.
[362:13.69]Well, that makes some sense.
[362:15.14]A time bomb?
[362:25.74]You had to say they are skinned for sure for suits.
[362:28.76]The material on the couch is not the couch's skin.
[362:31.16]It's a layer on top of the padding.
[362:32.78]Showed all those names.
[363:01.39]These are the people I saved?
[363:03.07]Are you saying he infected these kids and then gave them your drug?
[363:16.30]That he made 50 little ticking time bombs?
[363:20.17]I don't know.
[363:21.61]But you have to go find them.
[363:23.23]They're all scattered around the mall.
[363:24.59]It's possible, though.
[363:25.59]Look at this.
[363:27.92]Nobody up in Idaho, though.
[363:30.04]Just head to Idaho.
[363:30.88]Just make your house out of bricks.
[363:34.51]And cement.
[363:34.83]Or Wyoming, for that matter, yeah.
[363:53.92]What we need to do right now is prepare the hormones and get you taken care of.
[364:05.09]Okay.
[364:07.11]So what's next?
[364:10.62]Oh no, the generator's broken down.
[364:11.98]I can't work without power.
[364:13.52]Go turn on the generator.
[364:15.10]There has to be a backup generator somewhere.
[364:16.56]Carlito was using the clock tower for storage.
[364:18.66]Maybe he left one in there.
[364:22.01]Check out the clock tower.
[364:26.55]Oh no, the general... This is a filler episode.
[364:33.31]You don't go from... There are 50 children spread around that are all like ticking time bomb diseases to like infect the whole world to go turn the power back on.
[364:47.42]Unless you're stretching it a little.
[364:56.99]How far away is this?
[364:59.82]No, it's not that far.
[365:09.36]It is overtime.
[365:14.40]Let's just get out there and do it.
[365:21.29]Every game has this exact level at some point.
[365:26.33]What's with the power situation?
[365:31.19]In every universe, there's always like a generator you need to turn on.
[365:37.37]Are we just automatically assuming that just all electricity just goes rotten?
[365:45.10]It's not like raw hamburger meat.
[365:50.18]It just stays on.
[365:57.08]You just need somebody in there to, like, keep it turned on and to do maintenance to it.
[366:07.83]Okay.
[366:08.81]That's why a face cam's not on, because fucking boogers just shot out of my nose.
[366:18.27]It takes, like, a thousand people to keep a power plant running.
[366:27.15]Actually, I'm getting a cold, I think.
[366:30.35]It started developing right when I got back from the East Coast.
[366:35.55]And it hasn't gone away.
[366:36.67]It's still here.
[366:39.23]I haven't got a full-blown cold, but it's just halfway.
[366:44.17]A little bit of a scratchy throat and some stuffiness, but that's it.
[366:50.32]Stay away from me.
[366:50.84]Just come here for a second.
[366:52.72]Get away.
[366:53.10]Just don't come near me.
[366:53.82]Just come here for a minute.
[366:59.61]I'm not infected.
[367:01.92]I'm not.
[367:03.22]I'm not.
[367:03.52]Let's just talk really close.
[367:11.56]Like, shake my hand.
[367:13.26]And then shake, like, ten other people's hands.
[367:24.25]Can't get in there?
[367:28.90]What happened?
[367:29.46]Oh, did the satellite crash?
[367:31.33]Oh, fuck, that's a helicopter.
[367:33.59]Why does the satellite just crash?
[367:39.53]That's a stage light.
[367:41.28]This is the Truman Show.
[367:43.02]I know, it's bullshit.
[367:44.04]Okay, I've had the generator.
[367:47.98]It's time to leave.
[367:57.21]So I can just leave now.
[367:59.89]Right?
[368:04.67]I didn't... That seems very simple.
[368:15.47]Snacks.
[368:20.59]Imagine dropping your gun to eat potato chips.
[368:22.37]You don't have to imagine for very much longer.
[368:30.80]Straight up.
[368:33.96]Get queens?
[368:35.65]Should I just take a nectar?
[368:41.93]Take a nectar and just start spraying?
[368:56.04]Turma, not yet.
[368:57.40]Don't do it.
[368:58.30]Don't do it.
[369:00.29]Alright, fine.
[369:14.34]Wait.
[369:15.62]Nah, that's not worth it.
[369:19.22]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[369:20.88]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:22.72]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:24.88]How fast do you think I can string the syllables together?
[369:28.86]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:29.56]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:30.10]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:31.04]I'm not gonna do it.
[369:31.87]That's pretty good.
[369:54.66]Wrong way, idiot.
[369:56.14]Wrong way.
[369:57.04]Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[370:06.88]She sells seashells on the seashore.
[370:08.40]Seashells.
[370:09.16]She sells seashells on the seashore. She sells seashells on the seashore. She sells seashells on the seashore.
[370:20.35]Seashells.
[370:21.01]Seashells on the seashore.
[370:22.11]I tried.
[370:22.49]I did it twice.
[370:25.27]I don't know why I just go... What's another one?
[370:26.71]Give me another one.
[370:29.09]Give me another one.
[370:29.67]I know there's at least like three or four of these that exist.
[370:32.61]I've done this already.
[370:33.25]Yeah, but what's... How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
[370:39.16]How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
[370:44.68]I'll take another hard one, please.
[370:50.12]Unique New York?
[370:51.32]Unique New York.
[370:52.06]Unique New York.
[370:52.85]Unique New York.
[370:53.57]Unique New York.
[370:54.29]Unique New York.
[370:56.50]Uh, simple.
[370:57.68]Any others?
[371:06.45]Red, leather, yellow, leather.
[371:07.91]Red, leather, yellow, leather.
[371:08.93]Red, leather, yellow, leather.
[371:10.01]Red, leather, yellow, leather.
[371:11.01]Red, leather, yellow, leather.
[371:13.27]Um... Looking at my watch here, it seems like I've done no hard one.
[371:18.33]Huh.
[371:27.36]Robert Ducky, what was it?
[371:37.03]peter piper peter pipe what is it I need the whole line peter I don't know how peter piper picked a what peter piper picked a pack of pickled peppers peter piper picked a pack of pickled peppers peter probably picked a pack of pickled peppers peter piper picked a pack of pickled peppers peter piper picked a pack of people peter parker picked a pack of pickled peppers I had it I tried throwing parker there peter parker what is it peter piper peter piper picked a pack of pickled peppers peter piper picked a pack of pickled peppers peter parker picked a pack of pickled peppers
[372:08.83]I'm wasting time.
[372:10.59]Thank God you found a spear.
[372:11.66]Now I'll get back to work.
[372:15.94]Let me get back to work.
[372:20.18]If I was playing, I should have just about all the equipment I need now.
[372:24.16]Bring me some adult queens and I can get started.
[372:25.87]Alright.
[372:37.79]Wristwatch?
[372:45.68]Hold on, let me save this.
[372:49.85]I'm not saying that.
[372:52.79]I'll say that really fast.
[372:54.33]Oh, yeah, let me go for it.
[372:59.62]Now, I'm afraid that saying that wristwatch one and me saying it three or four times in a row is gonna be something fucking horrible coming out of my mouth.
[373:16.19]Alright, here's a queen.
[373:20.11]One queen.
[373:23.15]I need at least ten.
[373:28.80]Are you serious?
[373:37.48]Where am I gonna get ten queens?
[373:43.51]I have to go out to the park, drink nectar, and then mow everybody down.
[373:47.46]How many slots do I have?
[373:49.60]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[373:51.56]I have 10 slots.
[373:53.98]That's enough to hold one weapon.
[374:04.97]Just run zombies over in the tunnel.
[374:07.09]That's not a bad play.
[374:09.99]I'm going to go this way.
[374:17.45]No, we're not.
[374:22.35]Nectar smoothies.
[374:23.55]Nectar smoothies.
[374:24.23]Nectar smoothies.
[374:24.99]Nectar smoothies.
[374:26.67]Smoothies.
[374:30.25]Nectar smoothie.
[374:32.63]Nectar smoothie.
[374:33.11]Nectar smoothie.
[374:33.73]Nectar smoothie.
[374:35.14]Give me another one.
[374:49.67]Get off me!
[374:54.99]Google tongue twisters.
[374:59.65]Why did I just pick this up?
[375:01.85]Why would you ever give this to me?
[375:05.22]18 hours remain until you die.
[375:09.74]Nectar is just orange juice, right?
[375:12.18]Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.
[375:13.10]Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.
[375:13.96]Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't very fuzzy, now was he?
[375:16.38]Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.
[375:17.24]Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.
[375:18.08]Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't very fuzzy, was he?
[375:27.39]Nectar at the grocery store.
[375:42.76]I need to pay attention to the video game.
[375:44.36]Hold on.
[375:45.70]Going into this place, I'm going to get a bunch of orange juice.
[375:50.39]Orange juice... You can combine it with anything that makes nectar.
[375:55.27]Right?
[375:57.67]Wrong.
[375:58.57]What?
[375:58.77]What are you talking about?
[376:00.09]What do you mean?
[376:01.65]Oh fuck, don't make a joke.
[376:06.32]Spitfire!
[376:09.50]I'm not spitting fire.
[376:11.38]Fire's not coming out of my mouth.
[376:27.87]Aim with your fists.
[376:41.88]This is dumb.
[376:43.14]I'd rather have a machine gun.
[377:06.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[377:15.62]Give it all!
[377:21.38]Stupid.
[377:24.74]OJ only.
[377:25.70]OJ only.
[377:26.71]OJ only.
[377:29.19]OJ only.
[377:38.14]Yeah, he really is, like, just vibrating.
[377:40.56]Attack, attack, attack!
[378:10.14]Okay.
[378:11.38]Orange juice.
[378:12.76]Orange juice.
[378:18.36]Not milk.
[378:19.26]Not milk.
[378:20.04]Disgusting!
[378:29.42]Orange juice.
[378:32.62]Okay.
[378:33.34]I'm giving up one of the chainsaws.
[378:36.68]No, I'm not.
[378:37.76]Those are very necessary, I think.
[378:40.39]That's five nectarines.
[378:44.96]That should do it.
[378:45.98]If it can't, then I don't know what to tell you.
[378:59.26]To the cafe.
[379:07.95]Which will go down into Wonderland.
[379:11.39]Take the teleporter.
[379:13.36]Cafe.
[379:13.58]What do you mean, what am I doing?
[379:21.12]Why did we go here?
[379:22.40]To get... this... orange juice.
[379:28.76]Which is at the cafe.
[379:41.00]Wait, blender in the market?
[379:43.54]There's a blender in the grocery store.
[379:46.50]Blender in the grocery store.
[379:48.78]Why didn't you say so?
[379:50.38]Why didn't you say so?
[379:55.02]This is a lie.
[380:01.07]Is this a lie?
[380:03.49]It's a fucking lie.
[380:04.41]Of course it is.
[380:06.47]Liars.
[380:10.81]Unbelievable.
[380:11.53]We made it out.
[380:12.23]Yeah, of course we did.
[380:13.27]I can't believe I just took one, like, 10% out of HP.
[380:30.60]I don't even need it anymore.
[380:32.14]The battery's over here.
[380:32.84]The bathroom's over here.
[380:45.20]I just vilely coyote-ed that guy.
[381:01.70]He was gonna run into Hogwarts.
[381:05.20]Maybe.
[381:16.16]So now we go... Down... Up!
[381:17.60]Cafe!
[381:46.92]Right here another drone!
[382:15.28]I'm going to sneeze again.
[382:16.98]I don't know.
[382:17.73]My allergies.
[382:18.35]I don't even have allergies.
[382:19.75]I made that up.
[382:20.71]I don't have allergies.
[382:23.99]Oh, my allergies.
[382:25.81]All right.
[382:26.83]Pie orange juice.
[382:50.24]What?
[383:08.69]That's what he does, listen.
[383:12.43]Why is everybody getting so disgusted when I do it, but he's been doing this the whole game?
[383:18.77]And that's- you're not disgusted by that one.
[383:27.62]What do you mean that's me?
[383:28.26]No, it's not.
[383:29.60]I'll prove it.
[383:30.40]Ready?
[383:30.64]See?
[383:48.79]Why would I mute though?
[383:54.54]Who even cares about this?
[383:55.99]Nobody.
[384:28.78]So many.
[384:29.52]What happened to my gun?
[384:38.86]I can do one more.
[384:58.28]Okay.
[384:59.90]I'm going to drink this one just to be able to run.
[385:02.60]So let's drink this and then where am I running to?
[385:06.12]I am running to the inside the park over to the garage.
[385:13.65]What are you guys doing over here?
[385:19.61]German WWE.
[385:21.33]I've seen this already.
[385:23.53]I've seen it.
[385:27.90]Just get Queens now.
[385:31.34]Get Queens now.
[385:48.14]Where did... I only see one Queen.
[385:57.71]I have to wait for the nectar to end.
[386:03.09]Can't I just start killing people with the nectar activated?
[386:06.67]And does that increase the spawn rate, or am I just making this up?
[386:10.43]That's not real.
[386:18.90]No, it just spawns.
[386:20.00]Okay, so I need eight more.
[386:22.96]One, two, three... One, two, three, four, five, six... Okay, I need two more.
[386:49.46]Okay.
[386:49.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[386:52.40]I need to lose the chainsaw.
[387:09.63]Unfortunately.
[387:15.60]Just kill zombies with it while waiting?
[387:17.24]Not a bad idea.
[387:21.77]Why do I hear something?
[387:26.03]I can't believe you need 10 of these.
[387:36.92]I hear a queen.
[387:43.05]OK.
[387:44.11]Now.
[387:44.35]God damn it.
[387:55.82]Queen.
[387:57.18]No?
[388:04.56]Come on, spawn another one.
[388:10.41]Marathon runner achieved.
[388:14.75]What, I run like 20 miles or something?
[388:26.71]Use my new skill?
[388:31.41]Hold on.
[388:35.38]No queen.
[388:39.72]The wall kick?
[388:49.53]Still no queen?
[388:50.33]This Nekta sucks.
[389:04.06]Idiot spring.
[389:06.30]Why?
[389:08.30]There we go.
[389:13.00]Alright, three.
[389:21.03]I need six more.
[389:32.73]So here's the plan.
[390:01.90]No, I can't.
[390:02.78]They're all dead out here.
[390:03.56]Never mind.
[390:15.65]Zombies that have the hands above their head spawn the queen.
[390:22.99]God damn it, game!
[390:24.81]Why?
[390:25.33]Ha ha ha!
[390:26.71]Ha ha ha!
[390:35.47]When shit breaks, don't you think you should have like a fucking second?
[390:54.24]This other chainsaw is gonna break too!
[390:56.00]I can always get another one.
[391:20.85]Give me a queen!
[391:24.17]Just go farm with the car.
[391:25.53]Yeah, fuck this.
[391:27.77]I'm going to the car.
[391:48.15]Give me the queen!
[391:57.98]Alright.
[391:58.44]Do not break these.
[392:00.34]Do not... I hear another one.
[392:03.32]I still hear one.
[392:10.00]Alright.
[392:10.80]I'm getting close.
[392:15.01]Alright.
[392:15.97]Maybe I don't need to do that.
[392:42.09]Just keep killing stuff.
[392:50.79]Is that guy's hands above his head?
[392:51.92]That's the queen guy, right?
[392:59.86]I hear queen.
[393:00.38]There we go.
[393:16.53]Let's go.
[393:29.27]Lucky.
[393:33.45]I need another gun.
[393:37.19]I don't have ten.
[393:38.69]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[393:40.31]I need four more.
[393:42.09]Ten.
[393:42.35]Ten.
[393:45.76]Are you talking about?
[393:55.15]You already gave one.
[393:57.57]Yeah, so that's one, two, three, four, five, six.
[394:01.65]She said I need to give ten.
[394:02.71]Alright.
[394:30.35]No.
[394:43.09]Don't you dare.
[394:45.93]Jeremy.
[394:54.84]Don't do it.
[394:57.22]I gotta find some more military.
[395:13.19]Nope.
[395:17.79]I gotta kill somebody.
[395:19.06]Oh!
[395:19.32]Somebody with their hands in the air!
[395:34.64]All I have is a knife.
[395:46.19]Hands in the air.
[395:55.54]Done.
[395:59.50]Of course, the guy shows up right now.
[396:02.52]I got it all, right?
[396:03.10]I need one more.
[396:06.00]One.
[396:07.72]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[396:09.92]I need one more.
[396:24.74]Let's get it on the way back.
[396:25.92]Yeah, I need a weapon though.
[396:27.70]All right, teleport.
[396:29.82]Teleport save.
[396:30.44]I need like an electric guitar or something.
[396:35.08]Hands in the air.
[396:41.08]Got one.
[396:47.44]Bye.
[396:57.20]Although, I don't have any... I have no weapons.
[397:01.42]Nice job.
[397:01.88]You fucking... Maybe I'll... They'll sing songs about you.
[397:07.05]Just fuck it and run?
[397:08.95]I do have one drink left.
[397:10.03]Alright.
[397:26.16]Just have to turn right and go straight up.
[397:31.82]Hopefully I don't get shot by anybody.
[397:33.02]Get in the motorcycle.
[397:57.64]And we got all the coins we need.
[398:02.49]In fact, I'm gonna drink this.
[398:05.97]Wait, wait, where is it?
[398:07.16]Wait, wait!
[398:09.10]Wait, okay.
[398:09.84]No, get on the bike, get on the bike, get on the bike.
[398:11.36]Fuck it, I was gonna get a katana.
[398:34.72]All right.
[398:37.28]Turn it in.
[398:47.31]There you go.
[398:49.69]Bring me more queens.
[398:51.99]Mm-hmm.
[398:59.46]More.
[399:03.64]Can I just put them all in the same jar?
[399:17.46]I'll take another five queens, please.
[399:27.01]Keep it up.
[399:35.32]I should be able to make whatever it is we're making.
[399:46.62]Two more.
[399:50.54]Three more.
[399:50.94]Do I have three more?
[400:01.62]One last specimen.
[400:10.19]This is it.
[400:15.83]You're gonna inject me with that, huh?
[400:22.02]Okay, Doc.
[400:24.00]Let's get this over with.
[400:32.54]Mmm.
[400:43.58]at least I won't have to worry about turning into one of them for a while that just accelerated it okay next on the agenda figure out a way to get the hell out of here while I was isolating the hormone I managed to identify I really hope I don't have to go get like 10 frozen pizzas or something
[401:16.98]I'm going to smear ourselves with the anti-zombie juice.
[401:18.94]I think it's more clean.
[401:19.86]20 this time.
[401:21.86]That would be horrible.
[401:45.01]Either way, it's certainly better than nothing.
[401:47.93]There was a cave outside where the helicopter crashed.
[401:51.35]It was packed with zombies.
[401:52.37]I mean, shoulder to shoulder.
[401:54.47]But it may lead somewhere outside.
[401:56.33]If it works, your anti-zombie perfume, it could keep us safe in that cave.
[402:08.71]What do you say?
[402:10.31]You ready to get the hell out of here?
[402:15.44]It's a nice blender.
[402:16.70]It is.
[402:17.40]Or 100 times.
[402:17.80]As long as I save before it happens.
[402:19.12]I did not save before it happened.
[402:21.26]Good.
[402:45.42]Where on earth could this lead?
[402:48.06]I don't know.
[402:49.36]But considering how many of them keep pouring out of here, it must be connected to something.
[402:55.30]Isabella, look.
[402:56.04]Just throw the bike in the tunnel and just floor it.
[402:58.76]Any other way out of here is guarded by the military.
[403:03.67]If we're gonna get out of here and put a stop to Carlito's plan, we've got to go in there.
[403:08.15]What was the last time you saved?
[403:10.19]I'm doing a thing where I get three save points.
[403:12.89]I used my last one yesterday at some point.
[403:15.38]I've been doing like a kind of a hardcore thing, like hardcore night.
[403:23.46]I think I got it though.
[403:24.52]I know it.
[403:42.95]I'm going through the same five chat jokes, Jeremy.
[403:49.80]I'm getting tired.
[403:52.60]Why do you have to just go through the same jokes?
[403:58.76]Whoa.
[404:01.34]Save game.
[404:10.06]Did I do it?
[404:11.76]Are we covered in this?
[404:15.98]She just holds this magic scroll.
[404:17.55]I don't have any weapons.
[404:20.13]I have like a liter of orange juice.
[404:25.01]Okay, I got a rock.
[404:28.25]I got to pick up all the rocks I can.
[404:38.42]But where do we go from here?
[404:41.14]Just run?
[404:45.24]Is she going to open the door?
[404:46.08]Where do I go?
[404:56.19]Where do I go?
[404:56.89]Use rock.
[405:10.02]That looks like I could go in here.
[405:11.08]Can we open this up?
[405:20.03]Okay, we can open this.
[405:21.09]Together.
[405:21.41]Oh, she's gonna use her, like, immolation aura.
[405:44.44]No, I want a German suplex somebody.
[405:56.71]Rock good.
[405:58.47]Rock all I have.
[406:01.98]Used all inventory slots.
[406:04.68]On orange juice.
[406:14.07]Speaking of orange juice... I'm gonna need to use it.
[406:33.33]A queen's gonna spawn!
[406:36.90]Where's the queen that spawns?
[406:38.14]For drinking the nectar.
[406:55.59]Why did I... Why am I jumping back here?
[407:03.60]Hold her hand?
[407:04.28]I just tried to!
[407:08.28]Come here!
[407:08.72]Give me a queen!
[407:16.59]We keep getting separated!
[407:24.18]Dude, this game with the hand holding.
[407:25.62]You held hands, and if you touch anything, you just... Oh my god, I hate this.
[407:32.68]Get off of me!
[407:34.10]What are you doing?
[407:37.72]I'm holding her hand, and then you... Oh, sorry.
[407:43.30]You held hands, but then you... I'm just gonna run.
[407:59.97]Hey, come here.
[408:00.37]Let's hold hands.
[408:01.57]Hey, what do you say we go this way?
[408:02.67]I have to go all the way around you to make you go this direction.
[408:05.79]Let's go.
[408:06.13]Sorry, I don't hold hands anymore.
[408:12.86]Let's go.
[408:13.92]Follow me.
[408:32.67]Give me a rock.
[408:33.43]At least I got my nectar.
[408:43.82]Come here.
[408:45.98]Come!
[408:47.26]Knife.
[409:01.15]Oh, it's a pickaxe.
[409:19.33]Now, I don't know why magically she won't let go.
[409:23.11]No, there it is.
[409:24.37]Right when I say it.
[409:46.46]Come on.
[409:47.22]Walk forward.
[409:53.12]This is the worst vacation ever.
[409:58.18]Isn't that what I was doing here?
[410:00.20]What was I actually doing here?
[410:07.59]It's okay, honey.
[410:08.27]These are all actors.
[410:11.95]Really crazy.
[410:12.47]There's a zombie apocalypse.
[410:13.67]Yeah, they can't touch you.
[410:14.98]Don't worry.
[410:15.32]If they touch you, you can sue them.
[410:24.54]I'm fucking suing that guy.
[410:29.37]Are we going here?
[410:30.47]Oh, shit.
[410:35.45]Oh, honey.
[410:36.69]I'm gonna have to get all my lorries involved.
[410:39.57]I'm just tired of fucking killing people.
[410:48.68]Oh, no.
[410:49.54]They're fighting back.
[410:53.80]Oh, this way.
[410:56.22]Don't worry, honey.
[410:57.34]I learned this in Zangief school.
[411:03.90]Get over here, please.
[411:05.18]It's a queen.
[411:11.06]Give me the queen.
[411:16.71]Okay.
[411:17.63]Okay.
[411:20.31]What a stupid bait that tunnel is.
[411:25.15]Wait, there's more of this shit?
[411:40.02]This game is fucked.
[411:42.94]Stay with me!
[411:44.09]Why would you let go of me?
[411:46.41]No, you're making this so un-harder on me.
[412:13.59]Picked her up.
[412:18.49]Queen!
[412:22.10]No!
[412:22.44]Not on top of me!
[412:27.02]I can't even grab her hand!
[412:42.64]Stop letting go of me!
[412:48.20]Why are you letting go of me?!
[412:57.47]Mr. Queen, it's too late.
[412:58.47]Does this stuff even work anymore?!
[413:01.75]This stuff doesn't even work!
[413:05.61]It doesn't even fucking work anymore!
[413:08.01]I'm gonna die here!
[413:59.10]Hey, did you let go?
[413:59.69]Hey, did you let go?
[414:02.75]Hey, did you let go again?
[414:17.71]I didn't mean to get the ass shot.
[414:21.47]That's all I can do right now.
[414:23.21]I just want to hold your hand.
[414:24.49]Just please let me get through this ending segment.
[414:34.20]Walk slowly.
[414:35.08]I am, I promise.
[414:37.14]I promise I'm walking slowly.
[414:39.92]That's actually a pretty good opportunity for a photo.
[414:41.58]There's like a million faces.
[414:46.31]Yes, I am.
[414:46.73]Yes, I am.
[414:47.13]Yes, I am.
[414:47.55]Yes, I am.
[414:47.97]Oh, is that the problem?
[415:10.67]Trying to figure out what the issue was.
[415:19.90]Kill them Kill them with your scent You watched it happen Imagine the smell For them, I guess they really don't like this
[415:52.17]Like, a little bit of enthusiasm would be nice.
[415:54.81]It's like you don't want to be here.
[415:58.15]Like, you're the one... What did I do wrong there?
[416:01.71]What did I do wrong?
[416:03.25]She ran the fuck away from me.
[416:06.71]She fucking ruined it.
[416:15.11]She just bolted from me.
[416:19.11]And now we're getting overwhelmed.
[416:27.50]She's using me as a shield.
[416:30.51]This is not okay.
[416:40.32]Come here.
[416:45.32]You can't even fucking walk!
[416:46.72]Alright, it's time for a Zangief.
[416:59.06]Let's go!
[416:59.76]Let's go!
[417:00.42]Let's go!
[417:21.79]Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[417:22.99]Give me a rock.
[417:23.71]Come here.
[417:25.01]Right side.
[417:32.75]Alright, she got stuck here last time.
[417:38.79]You idiot.
[417:47.58]We somehow went higher up on the rock.
[417:49.90]How did we get all the way back up to the top of the rock?
[417:52.82]No, I don't want to go!
[417:53.88]Stop!
[417:54.28]No!
[417:54.54]Leave me alone!
[417:56.34]Help me!
[417:56.60]Please!
[418:14.58]What just hit me?
[418:21.03]No, stop going backwards!
[418:22.45]And they all just get on top of you!
[418:31.43]Isabella, you're going backwards!
[418:58.80]Are you drinking out of that thing?
[418:59.78]You're using it as like an inhaler.
[419:02.50]Alright, I made it.
[419:03.84]Queen.
[419:06.48]Give me the fucking thing.
[419:09.24]Give me.
[419:21.00]Is this thing out of juice?
[419:23.41]I've yet to understand what's going on right now.
[419:29.56]This is unbelievable.
[419:31.60]This is un-fucking-believable.
[419:38.98]Just run ahead of her?
[419:39.72]I tried to do that last time.
[419:40.97]It's over.
[419:54.98]I have to go get, like, guns.
[419:59.30]I can't just leave?
[419:59.88]I should have saved the goddamn game.
[420:13.45]Use the meat.
[420:15.81]Easier said than done.
[420:19.31]Why can't we just drop a bomb in here?
[420:23.08]Instead of making something to make me like live another three days, you should have made a bomb!
[420:32.19]You should have made like a bunch of fucking grenades.
[420:34.45]I'm doing it this time.
[421:12.16]Let go of my fucking hand!
[421:49.95]Wow, real hard, huh?
[421:52.37]It took me fucking five tr- How dare you say that and have that happen?
[421:56.84]How dare you say that and have what you just saw happen?
[421:59.44]How dare you say that when there's this rock here?
[422:01.34]How dare you say that?
[422:02.83]When this rock exists?
[422:04.29]How dare you?
[422:25.56]Somebody just told me to stop going through the zombies.
[422:28.32]And that's what's working.
[422:29.86]It's just running right into them.
[422:36.56]Oh my god.
[422:37.98]Let it be over, please.
[422:41.77]What did I just do?
[422:43.27]I just like Captain Falconed over here.
[422:45.79]What?
[422:47.79]What was that?
[422:56.54]Alright, I'll take it.
[423:02.67]No!
[423:26.77]Why did you fall?
[423:28.93]Oh, I don't have any weapons.
[423:34.11]Hands on your hips, really?
[423:36.37]Don't give me that shit.
[423:45.06]Hold on, let me just stop and push someone.
[423:47.88]Is someone going to make that my fault?
[423:50.54]Un-billy, un-fucking-billy.
[424:02.48]Now do it again.
[424:02.96]Yeah, we have to do it again.
[424:05.72]Are you sure this was a good idea?
[424:07.46]Terry, hear it.
[424:08.44]Military.
[424:08.90]I don't have any weapons.
[424:12.78]I had a whole beehive with me.
[424:14.51]They'll be too busy dealing with zombies to notice us slip by.
[424:17.83]Wait.
[424:19.43]The pheromone is starting to wear off.
[424:21.93]It's only strong enough to cover one of us.
[424:25.41]What are you doing?
[424:27.46]Hang on tight, okay?
[424:28.82]Once we're out, let's see if we can't steal ourselves that set of wheels.
[424:32.50]I hope so.
[424:35.84]No, just do it in a cutscene.
[424:37.09]Don't make me do this.
[424:40.75]Don't make me do this shit.
[424:41.83]I'm gonna go back here.
[424:54.24]Did you fall off?
[424:58.22]Um...
[425:03.72]Wait, what are we doing?
[425:15.76]Why?
[425:16.12]Why are we holding hands?
[425:19.91]I could have just picked you up and been the set.
[425:22.23]Why would we need to hold hands for this part?
[425:29.67]I can't believe it.
[425:45.25]I want to remember this moment.
[425:49.67]Here we go.
[426:12.27]Done.
[426:17.13]Why couldn't I just put her in?
[426:18.63]Can I be the gunner?
[426:20.08]Can you just drive?
[426:40.35]This doesn't seem fair.
[426:42.25]I'm gonna...
[426:46.16]Keyboard to keyboard.
[426:47.66]Mouse for this one.
[426:48.26]Does this thing overheat?
[427:19.55]I'm just shooting at the blinking lights.
[427:20.81]Holy shit, this is gonna take forever.
[427:42.32]My hand is getting tired.
[428:48.97]This is so long.
[428:52.34]Don't lose it now, I'm going fine.
[429:38.97]Got it.
[429:40.85]Is that the end of the damn game?
[429:53.58]Phase 2.
[429:53.82]That means if I lose this, I have to do that all again.
[430:16.04]What?
[430:16.28]Now what?
[430:21.38]Otis is gonna come back.
[430:22.97]And just rain fire down on him.
[430:39.59]Well, what have we here?
[430:44.17]I gotta get at least a decent photo before I die.
[430:46.83]Where were you hiding when my men mopped up the mall?
[430:55.57]On a mission in which the number of targets is unclear, it's difficult to ensure absolute thoroughness.
[431:08.03]You have imagination.
[431:10.20]That's what drives you in your quest to run.
[431:14.63]quest to hide His cigars not lit as prey You and your kind are much more stubborn than the zombies That's not how much do you know about the cinnamon stick I commanded the Santa cabeza cleanup operation If we had fulfilled our mission that it wouldn't be needed here now to take care of this I
[431:44.83]Alright, I don't have any weapons, so can I, like, beat him with charisma?
[431:48.12]That's all it was to you, huh?
[431:49.38]Do I have any dialogue options?
[431:51.16]What about those innocent people who had to pay for sins committed by our government?
[431:55.38]Our mistakes have not begun with this operation.
[432:00.73]I think I actually have a piece of meat, a rock, and a knife.
[432:05.17]Can I beat this guy with a rock?
[432:08.13]...has proven itself to be quite adept at making mistakes.
[432:15.93]Ha!
[432:17.13]Hell, it's the only thing we truly excel at.
[432:21.89]Well then, I'd say this mission isn't quite over yet.
[432:27.67]Don't you agree?
[432:44.81]Is the tank alive?
[432:46.05]Does it have thoughts?
[432:55.90]We're not gonna have a shitty version of On Top of the Metal Gear Solid fight, right?
[433:09.22]That was embarrassing!
[433:16.50]Suplex!
[433:31.45]What if I go down?
[433:54.92]I'm being such a wuss.
[434:08.09]No!
[434:10.97]I thought I was the cutscene.
[434:11.81]Alright, how do I do moves?
[434:24.31]Oh wait, he's fighting!
[434:25.91]Will he come down here?
[434:27.76]Wait a minute!
[434:29.28]I'm gonna pick up a zombie and throw it at him.
[434:35.57]Isabella!
[434:36.79]Isabella, can you fight hand-to-hand?
[434:56.92]That's a good photo.
[435:02.05]Can I like... What's the game plan?
[435:09.13]Just do the stomp?
[435:11.56]Jump, stomp, jump, stomp over and over again.
[435:26.59]Yeah, I'm going to knee drop over and over.
[435:33.07]Here we go.
[435:35.09]I can't do a suplex.
[435:40.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[435:45.98]That doesn't work, guys.
[435:51.60]He blocks it.
[435:55.75]Why don't I have a block?
[435:57.99]The spin move?
[436:00.21]Okay.
[436:01.83]Practicing.
[436:05.32]He's gonna block it.
[436:06.58]He's gonna block it.
[436:07.42]He's gonna block it.
[436:08.40]It's gonna be bad.
[436:09.20]And I'm giving myself... This is making it really hard for me.
[436:13.22]Just walk home.
[436:16.00]Okay, I'm gonna Spinning Lariat.
[436:20.10]Middle school fight tactics.
[436:23.70]Get away from me, you bully!
[436:30.10]Let's go!
[436:31.38]No, don't bite me!
[436:36.04]Get out of the zombies!
[436:40.21]Get out of the zombies!
[436:44.01]Kill him!
[436:44.63]Kill him!
[436:45.93]Bite him!
[436:46.31]Somebody bite him!
[436:47.21]No, not me!
[436:50.39]Oh, this sucks!
[436:52.50]He's stuck.
[436:53.64]Wait a minute.
[436:54.22]Okay, easy.
[436:55.34]Slow down.
[436:56.44]Take a second here.
[436:58.81]I just have to get back on the fucking thing?
[437:00.38]Like this?
[437:02.88]Like that?
[437:04.37]Okay.
[437:34.64]Spit on him?
[437:43.53]This is not gonna work.
[437:49.05]This doesn't hurt anybody.
[437:54.31]Does this hurt?
[438:02.32]No.
[438:20.52]I think he's getting hurt by the zombies.
[438:22.50]Kill him!
[438:26.10]Kill him!
[438:26.56]His health is going down!
[438:31.30]This is... I gotta get a photo!
[438:41.04]That's right!
[439:00.29]farm photos oh man that's a lot of photo money this is so much
[439:38.65]This is like, I'm getting thousands of XP.
[439:49.52]How much health does he have?
[439:50.46]I'm level 35.
[439:58.21]Get Isabella in the picture too, that's not- okay good, let's try that.
[440:07.90]She has to be facing the right way.
[440:08.86]Got it!
[440:14.72]Can I reach over there?
[440:41.21]That one's a pretty good one too.
[440:42.27]Okay, right here.
[440:56.20]Don't move it.
[441:05.62]Shit!
[441:27.34]Kill him!
[441:41.55]Is there a taunt?
[441:48.03]How do I taunt?
[441:54.01]I might have to get the last hit on him.
[441:55.86]Otherwise, maybe he'll just die.
[442:25.96]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[442:28.64]I've spit out all the fluid in my body.
[442:32.29]Yeah.
[442:33.43]Yeah, that's right.
[442:33.99]Alright!
[442:35.43]Fighting!
[442:35.75]Fighting him!
[442:37.09]I have one HP left.
[442:38.25]I think I'm getting close.
[442:41.09]Almost got it.
[442:44.09]Almost got it.
[442:44.47]Fuck, this is intense.
[442:46.43]Come on.
[442:51.27]One more hit.
[443:07.14]I have to finish him with a spit.
[443:13.00]I have to jump and land on top of him with this dump.
[443:25.75]Get out of here!
[443:28.25]He can't even believe it.
[443:29.53]He can't believe it.
[443:41.18]That was ridiculous.
[444:00.45]Now he epically falls back into the zombies.
[444:04.43]He did that four or five hundred times.
[444:07.15]The last one.
[444:09.96]That's all I got.
[444:11.22]I'm going all the way back.
[444:18.51]Epically.
[444:36.67]Well, that could have been really bad.
[444:46.06]Wait, hold on.
[444:47.29]This is not like a part two, part two.
[445:19.55]That's bad ending?
[445:20.60]There's a comic that explains what happens afterward.
[445:31.91]That's the real ending.
[445:32.75]No, that's the overtime ending.
[445:34.17]That's the true ending.
[445:35.07]Has to be, right?
[445:37.88]Does saving Brad actually do it?
[445:53.56]Thank you, File Actor Lich, for the hundred dollars.
[445:58.02]Ten thousand bits, I missed it.
[446:00.58]It was fifty thou- five thousand twice.
[446:02.71]This is the funniest thing I've seen in weeks, Jeremy getting rejected.
[446:06.19]She doesn't want to hold your hand, dude.
[446:08.31]No, we're supposed to be protecting each other!
[446:09.83]And then is this what Japan thinks what white people are?
[446:18.92]No, it's Frank West!
[446:42.73]They keep bringing Frank back.
[446:45.35]Well good, he's the original!
[446:46.53]Are they dancing?
[446:48.53]Is this what Canada thinks America is?
[447:06.03]Well, that was a trip.
[447:07.99]If that's truly the end, that was a wild one.
[447:13.58]I'm surprised I've never done that before.
[447:21.55]Let's do Dead Rising 2.
[447:25.51]But!
[447:26.65]Is there another Disney epilogue?
[447:34.38]No, I'll let you see.
[447:35.52]There might be a small little cutscene at the end, right?
[447:38.56]There might be.
[447:54.94]That was fun.
[447:57.70]Some of it, for me, that was a little all over the place.
[448:04.12]But, pretty damn fun.
[448:08.00]And ridiculous.
[448:14.33]I look forward to seeing Dead Rising 2.
[448:26.39]Play Dead Rising 2 off the record if you want to continue with Frank.
[448:28.58]Is that a DLC campaign or is that a main story thing?
[448:38.58]DLC?
[448:38.84]Okay.
[448:41.12]So should I do Frank West's campaign first?
[448:48.07]Infinite Mode has been added to the title screen.
[448:53.26]Don't do off the record first.
[448:54.34]Frank West managed to escape the town of Willamette with information pertinent to the incident under his belt.
[448:59.40]The news caused a fervor throughout the world, leading the U.S.
[449:02.42]government to admit at least partial culpability in the livestock research program.
[449:07.53]However, no connection to the Willamette incident was acknowledged, and the events that occurred there were deemed to work of a fringe terrorist group.
[449:16.74]the people of world as could be expected from the modern culture of new what was that soon let the willamette incident fade from their minds the authenticity of carlito's chilling plan to be utilized the orphans as his paws ponds has yet to be fulfilled and yet he complained that his belly was not full
[449:47.96]Right at number one.
[449:53.28]Nice.
[450:01.19]Very cool.
[450:08.87]That's it.
[450:13.03]I defeated the evil.
[450:15.99]That's gonna be the end of the stream.
[450:19.01]Pretty good place to stop.
[450:21.25]It's been over seven and a half hours now, so I think it's a good place to call it.
[450:27.38]The next time you guys see me will be on Sunday for... Wait for it.
[450:32.80]Community Content Night.
[450:40.77]Hope you had fun.
[450:42.27]I did.
[450:44.47]And I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[450:47.66]Let's transition out of here.
[450:48.66]See you soon.
[450:49.82]Have a good start to your weekend.
[450:58.16]Move that out of the way.
[450:59.78]And we can move to here.
[451:02.99]Good night, guys.
[451:05.31]And for those of you staying...
[451:18.83]Hey, look!
[451:21.09]Hey, the same people every time.
[451:23.67]It's never changed.
[451:27.10]Oh, that's the person's tattoo.
[451:30.02]That's still saved here.
[451:37.40]Anyways, let's do the bits.
[451:38.76]Let's go back to earlier.
[451:41.50]Where were we?
[451:42.18]Where were we?
[451:42.80]Where were we?
[451:43.50]Seven hours ago.
[451:47.45]mvm matt thanks for the 500 bits party party party you have been sleeping and then you wake up every night it's pretty interesting germa aka bath bomb boy thanks for the 500 bits appreciate it much love to you thank you the 500 bits
[452:17.06]Means a lot.
[452:21.53]I love the bath bomb boy.
[452:25.29]And it's separated by spaces too.
[452:28.03]That's the best part.
[452:32.05]It's like James underscore aka underscore bath bomb boy.
[452:41.12]That thought goes into every single word.
[452:46.13]But thank you so much.
[452:46.95]I appreciate it.
[452:48.51]Much love to you.
[452:49.61]Thank you.
[452:51.91]Then we had... StinkyBeaver for the 250 bits.
[452:58.64]Dude, this streamer is fucked.
[453:01.00]Thank you.
[453:05.88]Appreciate the 250.
[453:06.76]Abomination0, thanks for the 300 bits.
[453:10.49]I left my cookie in my milk and I'm about to drink it.
[453:12.51]This sucks.
[453:13.07]Why did you lie?
[453:22.38]It's good.
[453:24.36]Wait, let me completely rebuttal that right now.
[453:26.88]Do you drink the milk after you eat the cereal?
[453:30.53]Yes or no?
[453:34.25]Because that's what eating the cookie at the end.
[453:36.75]Of course you do.
[453:37.23]Yes.
[453:38.13]So if you drop cookie and you drink all the milk and the cookie stays in there for like five, ten straight minutes, that cookie, that's just the same thing as drinking the milk.
[453:50.87]I don't want to hear it.
[453:51.79]I don't want to hear it.
[453:54.25]How dare you?
[453:59.93]The cookie dissolves and becomes mush.
[454:02.23]Yeah, but a lot of the cereal coating dissolves and turns into weird, gross, sugary nonsense in your milk.
[454:11.13]I like it.
[454:11.53]You don't have to like it.
[454:15.95]Yeah, what are you going to throw it into the trash?
[454:21.59]No, you scoop it out, and you freeze it, and you make a popsicle out of it, like a little cookie pop.
[454:28.75]Up your game.
[454:29.19]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[454:33.26]I wonder how you feel when you look over a chat and just see a wall of purple links.
[454:37.82]Are you saying, oh, nice, a funny picture of my face, or are you like, goddammit, not this shit again?
[454:46.21]For the most part, I think it's funny.
[454:50.07]I mean, it usually is.
[454:53.27]That doesn't bother me or anything.
[454:59.11]Sometimes I click on a link and it's just like a simple edit with my face green or something.
[455:05.05]And then other times, it's like an insanely elaborate Photoshop.
[455:08.49]Yeah, like the one with my nerd neck.
[455:10.04]Alright, that's alright.
[455:16.38]We had five community subs from Jeff.
[455:17.80]I caught it.
[455:19.54]I just want to say it again.
[455:20.32]Thank you.
[455:22.18]Here comes the third... Okay, we need to talk about something after this.
[455:26.53]Okay.
[455:28.43]That is sneeze number four.
[455:30.23]Or three or four for this stream.
[455:35.07]I never sneeze on stream.
[455:42.08]Why is this happening now?
[455:43.66]Maybe once in eight hours.
[455:47.28]It's been four or five times today.
[455:51.07]Don't ask me why.
[455:53.49]Hey, alum, thanks for the thousand bits, alum.
[455:55.98]German, it's my 18th birthday tomorrow.
[455:57.68]Glad I could catch a stream.
[455:58.62]Thanks for being awesome all these years.
[456:00.64]Happy 18th birthday.
[456:04.88]You can now rent a car.
[456:11.73]No, that's 25.
[456:12.05]Happy 18th birthday.
[456:20.19]24, 24, 24, whatever.
[456:29.49]You can rent cars under 25?
[456:30.53]No, you can't.
[456:36.40]25.
[456:38.58]The minimum age requirement when renting a car in the United States is 25 years old.
[456:46.24]That's correct.
[456:48.63]yeah that's for real you didn't know that but uh happy birthday seriously thanks for the thousand bits hope you have a good one tomorrow or it might be tomorrow already so happy birthday now uh phylactery lich gave 5 000 bits and I think I missed it somehow
[457:16.51]On top of the other ones, at, I believe, $150 in bits tonight, which is insane.
[457:24.45]They say a squirrel on cocaine wouldn't be as twitchy as you are right now.
[457:32.20]I just, I get panicky in games like this, especially with save points and ways to sincerely screw stuff up.
[457:41.45]But thank you.
[457:45.10]Thank you for the lecture, Lich.
[457:46.64]Hyperactive.
[457:48.28]That's more so just hyperreactionary.
[457:50.45]Let me write that word out.
[457:56.99]That's incorrect.
[457:57.99]I just needed to say it first.
[457:59.51]Hyperreactionary.
[458:09.03]Thank you, SadVegan, for the 250.
[458:10.55]Glad you enjoyed this game.
[458:11.45]You missed a lot of special bosses with the psychos, which are really cool and warrant maybe a second playthrough.
[458:16.69]But honestly, go for the second one.
[458:18.91]The second one is really good.
[458:19.96]Doesn't have our boy Frank, but it's much better.
[458:22.92]Definitely recommend playing that now that you kind of know what you're doing.
[458:28.14]Yeah, it seems like to actually play Dead Rising through...
[458:34.03]You need to do it three or four times.
[458:36.63]And just go save other people.
[458:38.45]And then maybe you can get the timing down where you can do everything.
[458:45.57]But I don't know if I'd ever be able to do that.
[458:50.63]I don't think I would be.
[458:54.37]Oops.
[458:54.89]Don't knock that over.
[458:58.75]Yeah, I'll definitely play two.
[459:00.17]For sure.
[459:02.35]Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[459:03.43]I recently asked a girl if she wanted to start dating.
[459:05.35]She said yes.
[459:07.19]What are some good first dates you can recommend?
[459:11.91]Guys, what is it?
[459:14.36]Come on.
[459:17.22]I've talked about this before.
[459:24.36]No, no, I talked about this.
[459:29.17]No, not the carnival.
[459:31.57]Yes, Food Network.
[459:35.65]You put on Food Network, one of those just diners, drive-ins, and dive shows.
[459:39.97]It can, it just, it bleeds into itself.
[459:44.13]You can always talk about something.
[459:47.75]People are connected so heavily by food, and I'm not talking about going and eating food, watching food.
[460:00.56]You could eat food, too.
[460:03.98]And what even is a first date anymore?
[460:05.52]What even is dating a date?
[460:09.88]You're just going somewhere.
[460:10.98]You guys are going somewhere to do something.
[460:20.37]Making dates is like added pressure for both people, I think.
[460:24.27]Just watch 15 episodes in a row of Diners, Drivers, and Dives.
[460:35.92]After you hang out and you're comfortable with each other after like a few times, then go bowling.
[460:41.89]Because look, when you go bowling, this is, let me, listen to me.
[460:44.11]When you go bowling, you are going to think about every single thing you're doing.
[460:48.57]You're going to think about how you're moving the, you're going to, you have the ball in your hand.
[460:53.53]How stupid do I look right now?
[460:54.89]Did I knock down any pins?
[460:56.51]Am I going to lose?
[460:57.61]Should I lose on purpose?
[460:58.85]Should I try?
[460:59.43]Should I really go for it?
[461:00.45]And like, but are they going to like that?
[461:04.48]Do I look dumb right now?
[461:05.68]Did my mouth open weirdly when I turned around to say, hey, I got six pins?
[461:13.53]Don't eat either.
[461:14.47]Don't go to a restaurant.
[461:16.27]I will hit this hammer on the head of the nail over and over again.
[461:19.94]When you go to a first or second date to a restaurant, someone's watching you eat for the first time.
[461:27.14]You're scared to eat the food.
[461:31.16]Because, like, oh, fuck, like, I don't like, I don't want people to watch me eating, and then all of a sudden you've got somebody across an incredibly, potentially intimate relationship, then you're trying to, you don't want to, like, stuff your face with a hamburger, you have to talk to this person.
[461:44.46]Oh, so, when did you go to school?
[461:46.10]Oh, fuck, I just took a bite, I shouldn't have, I just took a bite, and I have to speak.
[461:51.02]It's like being at the dentist.
[461:54.08]No, it's not easy.
[462:03.26]unless what if you're going somewhere that you can eat with one hand maybe ice cream that's easy nobody looks cool eating ice cream but you're supposed to look cool eating a steak you are oh let me take out my fork and okay nice nice so this meat is super have you tried this yet yeah let me cut a nice thing and you don't want to be sitting there like gnawing up and down with a knife like oh I'd scrape the plate
[462:31.50]You need to know what the fuck you're doing.
[462:32.50]You have to pretend you know what you're doing when you're eating, like, a steak in front of somebody.
[462:37.14]You're gonna accidentally, like, shave off the fat part and eat it, and then you're gonna have to swallow it.
[462:41.15]Because, like, what, are you gonna spit it out in front of them?
[462:50.57]Ice cream.
[462:51.27]Easy.
[462:51.75]One hand.
[462:52.19]Nobody cares.
[462:53.63]Milkshakes.
[462:54.27]Easy.
[462:55.19]Coffee.
[462:55.85]Easy.
[462:56.49]Sip.
[462:56.99]It doesn't matter.
[463:05.55]Frozen yogurt.
[463:06.09]Yes, exactly.
[463:08.39]And then bring it back to the house or wherever, the apartment, and watch Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
[463:13.65]Four episodes.
[463:14.35]It's all you need.
[463:17.21]And then, hey, that was fun.
[463:18.29]We got ice cream and watched Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
[463:26.68]Because your eyes are focused on the screen.
[463:28.56]And a movie?
[463:30.00]It's like dark in a movie theater.
[463:31.43]It's like weird.
[463:32.95]It's like a first date.
[463:34.99]It's like pitch black room and loud.
[463:38.13]You can't even talk.
[463:38.79]What, are you going to turn and have a conversation to the date?
[463:42.77]No, you need to be talking to this person.
[463:46.50]Who gives a shit about what Guy Fieri is saying on the screen?
[463:49.54]I mean, it's incredibly important stuff, but you can interrupt Guy Fieri and it's not a big deal.
[463:58.91]Clip that whole thing I just said.
[464:01.33]And then use it.
[464:07.68]I've gone on this rant before, but trust me on that.
[464:17.60]Alright, where... That was... I have no idea.
[464:22.05]Oh, Smelly Boy.
[464:22.75]It was Smelly Boy.
[464:23.33]There you go.
[464:25.69]Hope we have a good date, Smelly Boy.
[464:30.96]I'll show my date your old TF2 videos.
[464:34.20]Mistake.
[464:36.58]Because she might not get it.
[464:38.38]And then you might become the weird guy.
[464:45.60]Like, Bobby Flay is just background noise.
[464:50.88]I... Bobby Flay is not gonna go like...
[464:55.26]At any point during that show, for you to be like, he does that sometimes.
[464:59.39]I don't know.
[464:59.81]It's like funny, I guess.
[465:00.95]He does.
[465:01.27]I don't think that's that funny though, but he does it sometimes.
[465:08.13]He's just sitting there on the grill, flipping hamburgers.
[465:12.90]And what's that?
[465:13.98]We're going to put a special mustard on this one.
[465:16.58]Who cares?
[465:17.18]That doesn't matter.
[465:19.62]That's not embarrassing.
[465:20.48]It's interesting.
[465:21.70]Interesting.
[465:28.84]Put on C-spin.
[465:29.40]Nononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononon
[465:59.42]Yeah, a good first date.
[466:00.74]What a perfect first date.
[466:01.60]Let me take you to a restaurant.
[466:02.59]I'm going to order a steak that I don't know how to cut.
[466:04.91]And the first thing I say to you is, Hey, what do you, what do you think about politics?
[466:08.87]Huh?
[466:09.95]Like scrape the fucking plate.
[466:12.27]A piece of fat.
[466:13.99]I mean, I, I, I, I just ate the whole fat thing.
[466:19.20]I had to.
[466:20.14]So, and he starts sweating and like sweats pouring down your head.
[466:24.47]Bad.
[466:25.75]Stamp on the... Put, like, the big thing, the big red X. And then it shows, like, a couple sitting on the couch, and, like, the color palette is increased.
[466:36.14]It's not, like, sepia tone, you know what I mean?
[466:37.66]It is, like, a nice, beautiful, big, open iris from the frame.
[466:42.08]It is, like, this laughter, big smiles, and Guy Fieri's on that TV.
[466:47.91]And you got two frozen yogurts.
[466:55.36]What time is it?
[466:55.94]Okay, here we go.
[467:00.84]Thank you to Doc.
[467:03.97]Thank you, Doc, for the $2.50.
[467:08.43]Doc3660.
[467:08.69]Jeremiah, have you heard of a game called Pilgrims?
[467:11.75]I feel like the humor and style is right up your alley.
[467:13.40]It would only take about an hour.
[467:14.20]Pilgrims.
[467:15.56]Pilgrims.
[467:27.32]What is this?
[467:29.14]Oh, actually, I did hear about this.
[467:30.74]This is by the Machinarium guys, right?
[467:33.24]Yeah, it is.
[467:35.38]This looks cute.
[467:36.08]Yeah, I'll play it.
[467:42.81]Definitely.
[467:50.79]Good jupe.
[467:54.25]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[467:55.23]Or 250, actually.
[468:01.13]Hey, we got a 250 from Flugboy.
[468:04.69]Jerma, hey Jerma, went to Death Stranding Gallery Expo in New York City tonight.
[468:10.02]And I'm probably going to go to the midnight release.
[468:11.44]I was wondering if you're going to play the game at all, not on stream, but in general.
[468:14.74]Or on stream too.
[468:16.44]Hope you have fun.
[468:17.22]That sounds like an interesting time.
[468:20.16]I will probably not play it on stream.
[468:23.31]Just because it's a fairly long game and fairly... I'm going to say this, and I don't mean this in a negative way, but dragged out.
[468:34.84]And I don't mean that in a negative way.
[468:40.35]No, the words are not boring.
[468:41.31]It just takes a long time to do a lot of stuff.
[468:44.65]If it takes a very long time to get anywhere or do anything, that's the whole nature of the game, isn't it?
[468:53.50]Isn't the whole entire video game based around dragging something up?
[469:03.99]I will absolutely play it off stream.
[469:05.43]But it's something I'll probably just sit on my couch and do.
[469:12.88]It's a pizza delivery boy game.
[469:20.48]Play Death Stranding for your first date.
[469:25.21]No, honest to God, I do not mean that in a negative way.
[469:30.25]I mean that in, like, I foresee myself just walking in a straight line with a briefcase in my hands for, like, 25 straight minutes and just trying to, like, what are we going to talk about?
[469:41.22]Podcast?
[469:41.86]Here we go.
[469:45.02]It has eight hours of cutscenes.
[469:52.16]That's not the type of game that I would stream.
[469:56.38]Does it actually have eight hours of cutscenes?
[470:02.52]That's the entire extended edition of Lord of the Rings.
[470:05.82]All of them.
[470:07.89]Wow.
[470:10.59]I've already made that reference, but I'll make it again.
[470:14.65]But the answer's probably no.
[470:18.43]Hope you enjoy it.
[470:19.10]I look forward to it as well.
[470:20.06]We'll see how good it is.
[470:25.00]Hey, DinoPulseZetta, thanks for the 500 bits.
[470:28.24]How you been, Jerma?
[470:29.42]Been wondering, who do you think you'd want for a DLC fighter in Smash?
[470:32.80]There's many that I want, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[470:35.00]P.S.
[470:35.20]There's an awesome Mega Man outfit you can unlock in the game, thanks to Keji Inafune being the game designer.
[470:42.91]I said that name so wrong.
[470:47.97]Who do I want in Smash?
[470:49.15]Scrooge McDuck.
[470:57.19]Final answer.
[471:06.50]Disney.
[471:07.02]Yeah.
[471:07.58]But the pogo stick.
[471:10.08]The moveset.
[471:11.00]The gems.
[471:13.02]It would make a perfect moveset.
[471:15.86]You can incorporate the pogo somehow.
[471:18.60]And he was an original Nintendo star.
[471:21.22]But he's Disney, so, yeah.
[471:22.80]Not Inspector Gadget.
[471:23.61]He wasn't a beloved Nintendo game.
[471:27.01]He had a shitty Nintendo game.
[471:28.11]There's a difference.
[471:35.41]What about Geno?
[471:36.58]Yeah, but I've talked about that before.
[471:43.18]But that's just... That's long shot territory.
[471:48.68]What's the best way to reach you for business conversations?
[471:51.36]I do not have a way.
[471:55.45]I lock myself in a cave and don't come out.
[472:05.19]There's a computer in here.
[472:07.33]And there's 500 Campbell's chunky chicken noodle soups in here.
[472:13.38]I just don't come out.
[472:17.96]But that's the real answer, though.
[472:23.03]Not, I mean, I don't, like, do, like, take business propositions.
[472:26.35]Not the living in a cave part.
[472:38.04]Campbell's chunky.
[472:41.96]I love those canned soups.
[472:45.04]I think they're fantastic.
[472:51.60]But, uh, Scrooge, uh, nose stuffed up when I said Scrooge McDuck, and then I said the D, and then my nose closed.
[473:00.11]Scrooge McDuck.
[473:02.99]And then DinoPulse again, a thousand bits from DinoPulse.
[473:06.79]Oh, it's the same thing.
[473:08.03]I think it was a double bit message.
[473:12.27]Uh, but thank you for the 1,500 bits, Dino.
[473:14.09]Appreciate it.
[473:17.23]Green 500 Castle Crashers with Josh Tucker.
[473:24.17]Who is Josh Tucker?
[473:29.68]I don't know who that is.
[473:32.88]I've already played through Castle Crashers.
[473:37.90]It's four or five times.
[473:39.54]So I would not play through Castle Crashers again.
[473:41.68]I've already done it many times years and years and years ago.
[473:44.20]It's a great game, though.
[473:48.79]Very good.
[473:51.97]What do you say we get the credits?
[473:57.71]All the subs, new subs, old subs, all of you.
[474:02.46]Thank you again.
[474:03.82]See you guys Sunday.
[474:14.40]For the community content night.
[474:21.76]If there's a problem with it, if I don't think there's enough, then we'll do something else afterwards.
[474:29.85]You know, if there's only like one or two hours worth of content, that's fine.
[474:33.57]We'll just do something else after.
[474:41.90]Thanks again, guys.
[474:43.60]Hope you enjoyed Dead Rising.
[474:45.36]I did.
[474:47.26]It's a wild ride.
[474:49.50]Loved it.
[474:51.12]But there's still a couple more bits here.
[474:52.49]We have Bob Boy.
[474:54.69]Everybody loves Bob Boy.
[474:56.03]Like, seriously.
[474:57.41]Five community subs from Bob Boy.
[475:01.41]Thanks a lot, Bob.
[475:07.59]Bath Bomb Boy.
[475:08.59]Lots of boys.
[475:09.93]Lots of Bath Bomb Boy.
[475:11.61]Bob Boy.
[475:13.09]Bath Bomb Boy.
[475:13.79]Thanks for the $2.50.
[475:14.53]Did you read my message?
[475:15.69]Germa Pluto.
[475:16.29]Did it not work?
[475:16.96]No, I saw it.
[475:19.08]Yeah.
[475:20.10]I did.
[475:21.42]I appreciate it.
[475:23.78]Thank you.
[475:27.08]Flugboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[475:29.14]Also, yearly reminder, Germa.
[475:30.42]Watch JoJo.
[475:31.10]I love you a lot.
[475:32.12]Like, a lot.
[475:35.50]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of those things that I will have to... You can't say no to this.
[475:48.77]You know?
[475:50.23]Saying I am not... I'm not going to say it out loud because then somebody will clip it and put it somewhere and make somebody really mad or something.
[475:57.74]Let me say something else.
[475:58.80]No, I'm not going to say that.
[476:00.80]Okay, you know the guy with the mustache that everybody loves?
[476:04.80]That jumps around and jumps on people?
[476:07.41]What's his name?
[476:11.40]That's an M. Yes, you guys are saying it.
[476:13.52]Alright, so what if I said I... I will never play one of those games?
[476:18.72]Because I don't think they're interesting.
[476:21.20]I'm not into it.
[476:21.80]What if I said that?
[476:23.14]How many of you would be angry?
[476:30.26]I think a lot of people would be like, that's kind of annoying.
[476:32.30]Like, why would you do that?
[476:33.32]Fuck you.
[476:34.67]So if I said, I'm not going to watch this show.
[476:38.57]I'm not into it.
[476:39.77]I don't want it.
[476:40.87]The fuck did you say?
[476:44.07]So from here on out, no more opinions.
[476:51.18]Ever again.
[476:57.78]I'm gonna have to confirm nor deny anything that I do.
[477:02.82]I love Mario.
[477:04.55]He's iconic and perfect.
[477:07.67]Except for Mario 3D World.
[477:09.27]Burn that game.
[477:11.01]I just said I wasn't gonna give opinions and I just gave a really, really, really fired up one.
[477:20.05]I love, I love Mario.
[477:22.78]Mario 64, Mario Galaxy, Mario Odyssey.
[477:26.10]Holy shit, these are phenomenal video games.
[477:28.92]Unbelievable.
[477:30.30]Some of the best games I've ever played.
[477:32.79]Just like in the top 20.
[477:34.37]Always.
[477:36.47]Super Mario fucking 3D World is not one of them.
[477:43.73]I'm sorry.
[477:47.37]That's my opinion.
[477:55.68]Rock goes through my window.
[478:04.26]WarioWare?
[478:05.02]I wish they'd make a new WarioWare.
[478:06.58]Like, hurry up already.
[478:14.35]You know something interesting?
[478:17.29]I've never played... Cut the music for this.
[478:27.01]I've never played Super Mario Sunshine.
[478:32.44]I've seen it played.
[478:33.10]I've never played it.
[478:44.75]Burn the Witch.
[478:47.71]Play it right now.
[478:48.87]Play it on stream.
[478:54.96]I've never played it.
[478:56.62]I've seen it.
[478:59.57]I think I've held the controller for like a few minutes.
[479:05.19]Is it better than 64?
[479:05.73]I just almost... That hurt.
[479:09.55]What did you just say?
[479:19.77]They were right.
[479:23.25]There's so many video games.
[479:27.81]Hey, Wizard Ribbit, thanks for the 500 bits.
[479:29.27]Jeremy, I've been watching your videos for five years.
[479:33.76]Recently, I signed into the Canadian military and I'll be leaving for basic training on Saturday.
[479:37.74]I won't be able to watch your streams for a while, so I just wanted to let you know how much I love them.
[479:42.64]Good luck.
[479:47.49]Thank you so much for being around.
[479:52.55]Look forward to seeing you when you come back.
[479:57.47]Thanks for being around as long as you have.
[479:59.65]Good luck to you in the military.
[480:04.54]Much love to you.
[480:06.84]Somebody said, it's hilarious if you think any Mario game is better than 64.
[480:15.83]I think people put Mario 64 just at number one, like S plus tier always, even if they don't believe it.
[480:29.74]Because I think... Super Mario World... is... probably... number one.
[480:45.32]For the Super Nintendo.
[480:49.72]Hmm.
[480:52.90]It probably is Mario 64, but every- Oh, what's the best Mario game ever made?
[480:56.14]People just go, oh, Mario 64, obviously.
[481:00.27]Did I have more fun in 64 for the first time, or Mario World?
[481:05.95]Or Galaxy?
[481:07.03]Or even Galaxy 2?
[481:08.01]Or Odyssey?
[481:17.14]Interesting question.
[481:19.64]Paper Mario, I have to play that too.
[481:23.38]Mario RPG, yeah, but I'm super biased on that one.
[481:31.16]Yeah.
[481:31.32]All right.
[481:32.92]See you Sunday.
[481:35.86]And then we had Wizard Ribbit gave five community subs.
[481:40.68]Thank you, Wizard Ribbit.
[481:42.58]Congratulations to all the people that got the subs.
[481:47.50]Take care, guys.
[481:48.60]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[481:49.86]See you Sunday for community content night.
[481:54.48]See you soon.
[481:57.76]And why don't you play us out?
[482:03.77]Good night, guys.
[482:04.21]Wait, hold on.
[482:22.24]What is this Nightbot command?
[482:23.38]Mods.
[482:24.22]Calamity, Thorium, Antiaris, Magic Storage, Potion Seller, Auto Trash.
[482:28.66]What is this?
[482:30.84]Somebody delete that.
[482:34.48]Just get rid of that.
[482:35.32]I think that's Terraria mods.
[482:36.64]Alright, goodnight.
[482:41.78]See you Sunday.
[482:43.66]Take care, guys.
[483:18.31]Thank you.
