[00:06.92]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:11.32]Jerma and MLC_St3alth here with a late night live commentary.
[00:16.53]Nice.
[00:20.39]You gotta be cool.
[00:22.13]You're even like in the call.
[00:23.35]Oh god, I forgot I equipped this.
[00:26.69]I'm already trying so hard I've become silent.
[00:30.45]Why did I go after him with that?
[00:31.93]That was a mistake.
[00:35.81]This is why I get out of my face.
[00:42.21]No, he's not there.
[00:43.29]But anyways, yeah, this is a late night live commentary.
[00:47.78]Haven't done a commentary like this.
[00:49.78]Pyro just walked off the edge.
[00:51.48]Haven't done a commentary like this in a long time.
[00:53.24]He was so WM1 that he didn't even know what to do when the edge came about him.
[00:59.86]The last time I... Jeez, when was the last time I did do a live commentary?
[01:02.82]Besides the live streaming stuff.
[01:04.85]I can't even remember.
[01:06.55]But here it is.
[01:08.73]Oh, you are a spy.
[01:13.01]I think he's still alive.
[01:14.55]Maybe.
[01:17.12]And get... Yeah, I got ya.
[01:24.20]Did that guy just blow himself up?
[01:26.92]There seems to be a lot of people who are doing that this game.
[01:29.97]Come on, take another one of those.
[01:33.67]I can't hit this guy.
[01:36.65]Oh my god, I just barely missed him.
[01:39.31]What is... You know, it's been so long since I've used the flare gun.
[01:44.99]I equipped it to change things up and I haven't even... Yeah, that's a spy.
[01:48.91]What are you playing as?
[01:51.92]Pyro.
[01:53.48]I gotta get my flare gun shots down.
[01:56.08]We've been playing Shoot Mania Storm for years.
[01:58.90]Come on, for years.
[02:01.68]Oh, that's gonna make people angry.
[02:05.69]I just shot a rocket into the spawn.
[02:14.11]Oh, look, it's Wheatley.
[02:15.37]Here we go, he's Dean Pelton.
[02:16.43]What's he got?
[02:16.93]He's got the knife, the ambassador.
[02:18.85]Oh, you're watching me?
[02:20.15]I'll watch this spawn kill.
[02:23.69]Are you really just, like, spot-killing people?
[02:27.05]Kinda.
[02:27.65]It's not, like, on purpose, though.
[02:29.51]And I did face-stab a heavy just now.
[02:32.93]Yeah, I'm spot-killing.
[02:33.77]Oh my god, yeah, right.
[02:35.79]Oh, I just got crit-rocketed in the face.
[02:41.12]I was gonna reflect it, too, I just got too close to him.
[02:44.92]Where am I on this scoreboard?
[02:46.90]Pretty awful right now.
[02:47.76]You're doing pretty good.
[02:52.96]I just heard somebody scream.
[02:57.51]What?
[02:57.67]How did this guy get back here?
[03:00.15]My goodness.
[03:05.07]And scout!
[03:05.95]Get hit.
[03:06.46]No.
[03:07.98]Why did I do that?
[03:13.62]Man, blue team is just not doing so well right now.
[03:15.32]I think maybe we should switch to the other team.
[03:18.50]Probably, yes.
[03:20.80]Let's tell Black Hole Sun and Reverse Cowgirl 133 to go on... Oh my god, so many people just came up here.
[03:28.02]Someone's gone spectator.
[03:30.05]The entire blue team just came up the stairs.
[03:34.41]So many people were just right there.
[03:38.07]It's almost like they were, like, all of them were talking over, like, Skype to come and get me.
[03:44.03]I dare you, get that pyro.
[03:45.44]Medic.
[03:49.28]Medic.
[03:50.91]Oh my gosh.
[03:56.01]Oh!
[03:56.43]That guy's emblem is the community, like, flag for the school of the TV show.
[04:01.89]Really?
[04:02.11]He's my new favorite person.
[04:03.68]I was just about to, like, hate him for killing me, but I can't, you can't hate that.
[04:08.00]He deserves.
[04:08.56]Oh, okay.
[04:09.60]Oh, and my name is Dean Pelton!
[04:11.20]How great is that?
[04:12.60]He probably likes you right now.
[04:14.18]He loves the references.
[04:14.84]Oh, hold on.
[04:15.58]Not sure what to do.
[04:16.34]I think we, uh, I think we got it.
[04:18.12]Let's, oh god, sniper.
[04:21.35]Let's go blue.
[04:23.03]Can you get on blue?
[04:25.97]Not sure what to do.
[04:26.87]Love your emblem, says Dean Pilton.
[04:29.46]Oh, it's too late.
[04:30.12]Can't.
[04:30.50]We're going to have to be against each other now.
[04:32.32]I'm going to destroy you and burp at the same time.
[04:37.46]Not even high enough.
[04:38.24]Rain needles down.
[04:42.27]Are those even making it across?
[04:47.61]I think so.
[04:48.11]Maybe not.
[04:52.81]Oh, buddy, you have no idea what's in store for you!
[04:57.75]I really need to put on the crit streak if I'm gonna do this.
[05:00.29]I will put that on after.
[05:01.19]Oh, come on now, you demoman!
[05:08.60]Hey, kill me.
[05:10.18]Thanks, ma'am.
[05:13.92]Oh, come on!
[05:14.75]How does nobody die from that?
[05:16.55]How does nobody die from that barrage of needles that went in his face?
[05:24.91]I'm doing it again.
[05:25.77]What have you got?
[05:27.42]Oh, he's building the sentry.
[05:28.92]Is that you building that sentry?
[05:30.62]I am on spy.
[05:33.36]So, nope.
[05:34.06]One more hit and this guy's dead.
[05:37.23]He knows it, too.
[05:37.85]Oh, that was lucky.
[05:43.35]Alright, I got a...
[05:44.79]I got to turn the Kritzkrieg.
[05:45.87]Turn the Kritzkrieg on.
[05:47.01]I got to put the Kritzkrieg on.
[05:49.49]Let's push this up.
[05:51.88]And... Stay on this point, boys.
[05:54.78]Heals for everybody.
[05:55.76]Heals for all.
[05:59.02]And that's when I make my exit.
[06:01.70]Stay on that.
[06:02.54]Nice.
[06:04.14]Is he going to get it?
[06:04.66]I hope so.
[06:05.61]It's probably a bad idea that we're facing each other.
[06:10.19]I'm going Battle Medic, man.
[06:12.09]What?
[06:12.57]What?
[06:13.97]Huh?
[06:14.86]What the hell was that?
[06:16.48]Oh, man.
[06:17.40]My god, a lot of chaos here.
[06:22.16]Oh, I was lucky and close.
[06:25.06]I need the health that's up here.
[06:26.10]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[06:28.60]Alright.
[06:29.12]Ondar... Is that guy's name Ondariel?
[06:32.56]Oh, what?
[06:33.36]Oh, random crits.
[06:34.19]Those confuse me right now.
[06:37.87]Let's go down here.
[06:38.77]Let's go down here, buddy.
[06:41.19]Oh, look out.
[06:43.83]Kill that heavy.
[06:44.87]I gotta keep this thing on him.
[06:56.00]Now he needs it.
[06:56.72]Alright, so I see a spy on my team.
[06:59.54]He's just crouch walking around with his thing.
[07:07.26]I wish you could have seen what just happened here.
[07:09.66]I wish you could have seen what just happened here.
[07:12.80]He's gonna know I'm right here.
[07:15.17]See if I can't... Oh, I thought I could have killed him.
[07:19.38]How much health?
[07:20.10]Oh, no way.
[07:26.40]Oh, my gosh.
[07:28.29]That guy's lagging.
[07:29.63]Jeez.
[07:31.43]I hear a roar across the whole stadium right now.
[07:33.47]What's happening?
[07:33.99]I don't hear anything.
[07:39.32]It sounds like I'm in a haunted mansion right now.
[07:41.19]Wait, what?
[07:42.59]Oh my god, it's a speed hacker!
[07:45.49]What?
[07:47.91]It's a hacker!
[07:49.35]It's a speed hacker!
[07:51.73]It's a speed hacker!
[07:56.44]Dude, it's a guy with, like, scream hacks, speed hacks.
[08:03.28]Like, oh my god.
[08:05.16]That scared me so much.
[08:13.44]Dude, what's with, like, the screaming?
[08:15.52]Look at this.
[08:16.50]I thought I was in a haunted mansion.
[08:17.80]I gotta go, like, spy.
[08:19.28]No, don't open the door, you idiots.
[08:20.82]I just thought everyone was, like, dying.
[08:22.50]Oh, you... Everyone in the world.
[08:25.30]You bastards, don't open that door.
[08:27.57]Dude, he is going.
[08:28.25]Look at him.
[08:29.57]Don't fight.
[08:30.11]Where is he?
[08:31.19]Oh my god, dude.
[08:33.13]Oh, I'm scared.
[08:34.41]I'm just gonna go.
[08:34.93]I'm holding the Dead Ringer out.
[08:36.27]I am so afraid of that noise.
[08:42.56]Where is he?
[08:45.00]What a psycho!
[08:46.14]Oh my god.
[08:49.66]Oh my god.
[08:50.82]Holy crap.
[08:54.91]Oh, that's terrifying.
[08:56.23]Can you hear this?
[08:58.79]Yeah, I can hear it.
[09:01.51]Oh, man.
[09:02.19]Well, so much for the live commentary.
[09:07.47]What are you talking about?
[09:08.45]We got it.
[09:10.56]This is great.
[09:13.41]Oh my gosh, I'm gonna have a nightmare of this sound.
[09:16.74]He's just following me around.
[09:18.28]Oh, I'm dizzy right now.
[09:22.02]Hold on a second.
[09:24.50]I need to go spectate.
[09:26.35]I need to watch this guy.
[09:28.39]Why does it say everyone's changing their name to Dean Pelton?
[09:31.09]Because that's him.
[09:31.81]They clearly are not.
[09:33.35]That's him.
[09:33.81]Where is he?
[09:34.19]Oh, here he is!
[09:35.61]Hey, look at this guy.
[09:36.48]Look at this guy's totally legit game he's doing right now.
[09:40.82]Like, anyone he, like, runs into, he changes his name to them.
[09:45.58]This is, um, this is ridiculous.
[09:50.55]I'm spectating him right now, and it seriously is, like, one of the just oddest things I've ever seen.
[09:54.63]Yep, here I come.
[09:57.55]Well, um... What's his name?
[10:00.11]Oh, okay.
[10:01.31]His name changes every two seconds.
[10:03.23]Oh, this is hurting my head.
[10:05.34]I know, I have to, like, I, I, I just, I disconnected.
[10:08.99]I, like, couldn't take, like, the screams in my head anymore.
[10:12.88]That's scary.
[10:13.90]That is a terrible, that's a scary sound.
[10:16.02]That really is.
[10:21.43]Oh my gosh.
[10:23.61]Well... Alright, so apparently I wasn't going crazy when I said, Hey!
[10:30.04]Why am I afraid right now?
[10:32.52]In a haunted house.
[10:33.62]What are you talking about?
[10:34.48]Oh my gosh!
[10:38.57]Thanks everybody for watching.
[10:42.09]I do appreciate it.
[10:44.08]Yeah, hacks are not cool.
[10:48.86]So I guess we'll talk to you guys soon.
[10:51.37]Take it easy, everybody.
[10:52.69]Oh, I just said take it easy, everybody.
[10:54.57]I didn't even say take it easy.
[10:57.07]Take care, everybody.
[10:57.86]See you all soon.
