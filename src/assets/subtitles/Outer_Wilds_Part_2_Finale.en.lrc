[00:01.05]He took so long to TP back A lot of people are not gonna know what you're talking about by that
[00:23.12]We had an extensive pre-stream chat earlier.
[00:28.21]Talking extensively about the idea of having a teleport power.
[00:32.91]This is why you don't want to miss the pre-stream chats.
[00:34.67]You gonna wink?
[00:40.93]Already?
[00:42.35]Right now?
[00:42.71]Alright.
[00:47.87]Redeem that in just a second.
[00:48.93]I'm not ready.
[00:50.43]Hold on.
[00:50.91]I'm actually not ready to do that.
[00:56.34]There.
[01:00.99]That wasn't scammed.
[01:01.79]I just did it.
[01:13.69]Keep your cam on.
[01:14.43]I love, love, love, love your haircut.
[01:16.72]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:25.90]Does it really have to be 75,000 Pepe hands?
[01:30.22]Well, yeah, otherwise the whole stream would be Winx.
[01:32.90]And I don't want to do that.
[01:34.85]I might just... God damn it, I bumped you.
[01:37.71]I might get rid of Winx in like a month or two.
[01:41.93]I don't know.
[01:42.35]I might like delete Winx and we might change it to something else.
[01:44.87]There's always going to be a 75,000 point tier, but I might change it to like something.
[01:52.74]I don't know.
[01:53.16]We got to freshen it up a little bit.
[01:57.03]I'm saving it for the day.
[01:59.45]Let's just save it then.
[02:00.19]I don't know.
[02:01.79]Every few months we'll make the 75,000 point thing be something different.
[02:05.53]That's the idea.
[02:06.91]Anyways, we're going to try to finish Outer Wilds today.
[02:12.87]If you missed it, I started it yesterday.
[02:14.82]It's got me interested.
[02:16.36]It's a really fun, interesting game.
[02:18.84]And I think we've got another six to seven hours in the game.
[02:24.08]We should be able to do it.
[02:28.55]And I was here.
[02:29.15]I was gonna start in like 45 minutes, but I'm here.
[02:32.63]And I'm ready.
[02:34.11]I've eaten.
[02:34.67]I had two, that's right, two baby food pouches.
[02:39.56]That's not a lie.
[02:41.62]Those of you that want advice, hey, I got any advice to like, how do I, you get like streaming advice, right?
[02:48.58]Hey, I'm starting a channel.
[02:49.46]What do I do?
[02:51.05]Baby food pouches.
[02:54.39]I'm serious.
[02:56.52]It's incredibly fast.
[02:58.08]It keeps you going.
[02:58.96]It's a quick snack you can have in the middle.
[03:00.75]Like, I go downstairs and pee.
[03:03.51]And during those breaks, sometimes I'll just grab one of those little baby food, like, on-the-go packs.
[03:08.97]And just, there it goes.
[03:11.43]It's like apple, bananas, and strawberries.
[03:14.21]It's got, like, a little bit of protein.
[03:16.08]That's not bad.
[03:19.86]Here's your streamer advice.
[03:22.80]Like, man, when I do like these 5, 6, 7 plus hour long broadcasts, I did... There you go.
[03:30.26]Get baby food packets and eat them when you take a break.
[03:39.00]That's not that weird.
[03:40.02]That's like one of those secret tips that no streamers will tell you.
[03:44.79]All streamers eat baby food.
[03:46.89]They just don't want you to know.
[03:48.75]Okay?
[03:49.33]Let's be clear.
[03:56.67]You're regressing.
[03:57.71]Yeah, a little.
[03:58.43]But we're going to finish Outer Wilds tonight.
[04:00.01]Or try to.
[04:03.64]And then tomorrow, I will probably have my Xbox 360 hard drive.
[04:08.08]We're going to do Tony Hawk's Underground.
[04:11.14]And then the next day, Diablo II Hardcore.
[04:15.77]And maybe Asura's Wrath DLC.
[04:17.95]Maybe.
[04:18.47]Depends on how much I play Diablo II.
[04:26.95]I also have... Trying this... I've got this thing on today.
[04:31.75]I've got this back and rib and stomach brace on today.
[04:37.13]Trying to take... It feels pretty good, actually.
[04:39.71]I actually feel pretty good.
[04:41.86]It's wrapped around... Show it?
[04:42.94]I mean, I don't think I really can.
[04:44.24]Hold on.
[04:48.54]Can you see?
[04:49.00]It's like wrapped around my shoulders.
[04:52.10]I have to, like, I guess it's probably worth addressing right now.
[04:54.63]Because people are just going to think I'm wearing a backpack.
[04:59.87]You see?
[05:01.59]Dude, why are you wearing a backpack right now?
[05:04.61]Because I'm going to school.
[05:08.79]Okay, there you go.
[05:10.43]It's on here, it wraps around, it pulls me back.
[05:12.59]There's one, there's like a thing that goes around my stomach too.
[05:17.30]He's an Omega Gamer.
[05:21.36]Why do you look like a different guy?
[05:28.18]What?
[05:30.80]Why do you look like a different guy?
[05:32.18]Hold on, what do you mean?
[05:33.32]I look like a different guy?
[05:34.36]No, I don't.
[05:46.45]Why do you look like a different guy?
[05:47.87]It's me, right?
[05:51.77]Is this me?
[05:52.53]No, it's because, like, the light and the shadows and stuff.
[05:56.69]This eye over here is, like, fully in shadow, and it's, like, fucking up your vision.
[06:01.56]Why do you look like a different guy?
[06:03.36]Hold on.
[06:07.72]Let me... Hold on.
[06:09.58]Let me quell your fears here.
[06:12.24]Okay.
[06:12.66]Here you go.
[06:13.70]This is what you were used to.
[06:18.35]Am I a different guy today?
[06:22.73]That's better.
[06:23.80]That's better.
[06:24.34]Okay, that's better.
[06:25.22]Now you're the guy that was here yesterday.
[06:28.00]The colors in your room changed.
[06:29.40]It could be anybody.
[06:30.42]I got a lot of looks too, by the way.
[06:33.82]People that say, oh man, you look different today.
[06:35.58]I could probably be like four or five different people.
[06:38.42]I really could.
[06:45.95]Anyways.
[06:48.00]Out of wilds.
[06:50.62]Let's go.
[06:54.57]What's the last thing we did?
[06:58.97]This streamer is delusional.
[07:08.83]How am I delusional?
[07:13.24]What did I say?
[07:17.56]Dude, quick comet jump joke.
[07:23.51]No.
[07:24.15]Okay, I was unraveling the mystery.
[07:25.45]This is the best fucking game, mate.
[07:28.24]Best fucking game.
[07:30.67]I mean, it's pretty good.
[07:31.91]It's really... I have to hold... I don't... I'm interested in the story.
[07:35.55]Okay, those of you that didn't see yesterday and you like this game and you're like, well, what the hell has he done so far?
[07:40.30]This.
[07:41.38]This is what I've done so far.
[07:43.70]I was going to go... Where was I going to go first?
[07:46.78]The Hanging City.
[07:48.71]No.
[07:52.01]Found a cave with an anglerfish fossil inside, but the opening is only big enough for my scout.
[07:57.13]Alright, this part.
[07:58.17]The escape pods and shit.
[08:00.41]The comet.
[08:01.07]No, no, no, no.
[08:01.51]I want to do this.
[08:04.20]The normally crafted warp cores at the Black Hole Forge.
[08:09.02]Alright, where's the Black Hole Forge?
[08:14.92]Is it in the Black Hole?
[08:16.33]We also didn't even find this person.
[08:20.18]Al says, Gabbro went to Giant's Deep to try to learn more about the Nomai statue.
[08:24.00]Alright, I kind of have to... This is like a tutorial quest.
[08:26.84]I kind of have to do that.
[08:27.67]Alright, we're going to go try to find that guy on Giant's Deep.
[08:35.67]You going to work?
[08:36.29]See you in four hours?
[08:39.33]See you in four hours.
[08:41.41]Hopefully you don't miss the first sun joke of the night.
[08:43.44]Alright, Giant's Deep now.
[08:51.96]Don't worry, you won't.
[08:52.98]Okay.
[08:56.51]Let's go up Giant's Deep.
[09:02.70]I want... Wait, is he going to miss the first joke or the first sun joke?
[09:07.68]Well, he's going to miss the first vroom of the evening, and that's arguably way more important.
[09:21.07]Uh-oh, sun crash joke incoming.
[09:23.77]Here it comes.
[09:24.73]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[09:31.22]This is what people were saying last time.
[09:32.78]They're like, dude, please don't fly 300 meters a second into planets.
[09:38.48]I know, but I just... I know.
[09:43.95]But look, it's not even moving.
[09:45.49]Space doesn't make any sense.
[09:46.43]Look, I'm not even moving right now.
[09:54.04]You're going too slow.
[09:55.36]Okay, what would you guys say is a safe speed to go towards a planet?
[09:59.60]150?
[10:00.38]200 meters?
[10:01.88]What is, like, the... What's, like, the I could get a speeding ticket?
[10:06.51]What's the don't go over, like, 65, 70, you're gonna get a speeding ticket?
[10:11.01]What would it be?
[10:11.44]300?
[10:11.46]250?
[10:11.50]Alright.
[10:19.62]But this is a safe speed.
[10:20.90]Yeah, this seems normal.
[10:22.18]Alright, let's try to find this guy.
[10:27.12]Speeding ticket is 800 meters a second near constellations.
[10:29.64]Okay, well that's good to know.
[10:33.98]What's my skincare routine?
[10:37.62]Uh, hold on.
[10:42.53]I even... Okay, we're good.
[10:45.39]Uh, my skincare routine is...
[10:49.87]in shower close eyes push face into running water from shower head and squint and close my eyes and then rub my face and then when I get out more importantly I moisturize every day that's the thing that's a problem a lot of people have they'll say like hey I got any skin care tips yeah moisturize your face moisturize your face every day okay what is over here
[11:20.40]Have I been over here?
[11:26.93]Yeah, I did this already.
[11:27.89]Alright, I did that already.
[11:29.93]Is there another spot to go?
[11:30.83]What's this one?
[11:38.68]Did I do this yet?
[11:39.38]I think I did.
[11:41.42]Yep, I climbed up there.
[11:42.58]That's where the... Where else have I not been on this island?
[11:47.83]Oops.
[11:50.60]Gabbro?
[11:53.18]What?
[11:55.34]Hold on, wait, is he in the water?
[11:57.02]Is he in the water?
[11:59.04]I think he might be in the water.
[11:59.92]Can the ship go in the water?
[12:07.67]Yeah, it can.
[12:08.37]Alright, the ship can go in the water.
[12:18.22]Am I going forward?
[12:25.11]Am I in the water?
[12:30.14]Okay, that was weird.
[12:30.78]I don't think I can move in the water.
[12:35.68]Alright, Gabbro's definitely down here somewhere.
[12:39.70]I'm just going to skim the water and find him.
[12:44.57]He's playing some kind of flute or something.
[12:46.27]Wait, there we go.
[12:46.99]There he is.
[12:47.27]Go down.
[12:48.39]Go down.
[12:51.60]Did you buy this on the Epic Store?
[12:54.08]I think that's the only place you can get it.
[12:55.24]There it is.
[12:58.50]Alright, found him.
[12:59.66]Alright, I'm going to do this tutorial quest.
[13:02.10]Oh, fuck.
[13:02.70]Slow down.
[13:03.52]Oh my god.
[13:04.02]Tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt.
[13:06.40]Do you have a place to land up here?
[13:10.88]Imagine looking over your shoulder right now.
[13:27.59]Alright, there's no landing pad here.
[13:31.74]Oh wait, I can go this way.
[13:33.62]Alright, there's a spot I can climb up there.
[13:35.04]Alright, fuck it, let's go.
[13:44.99]We safe?
[13:46.69]Kind of.
[13:53.94]There we go.
[13:54.80]Unidentified signal nearby.
[13:55.94]Is he up or... Ooh.
[13:59.14]There's ghosts and shit in here.
[14:00.52]That's the ghost?
[14:01.42]Yep.
[14:01.62]Alright, hold on.
[14:06.50]Wait, he was right there?
[14:07.40]I didn't know that that was somebody in that.
[14:15.78]I didn't know somebody was in that.
[14:18.76]I didn't have my flashlight on and the water was on my face.
[14:21.16]Alright, let's go.
[14:23.65]Nice, it's you.
[14:24.33]Good to see you made it in here in one piece.
[14:25.55]The first solo launch is a doozy, isn't it?
[14:28.23]Hey, don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly.
[14:31.25]I don't know.
[14:31.89]Wait, you're dying too?
[14:34.69]You're dying too.
[14:39.44]What about you?
[14:39.90]Have you died lately?
[14:41.68]No, it's me too.
[14:42.48]We're in a time loop.
[14:44.46]Time has been behaving unusually lately.
[14:46.22]Yeah, time loop makes sense.
[14:47.62]Cool.
[14:51.50]I'm taking this pretty well.
[14:53.10]Right back at you.
[14:54.00]Personally, I like the new experiences.
[14:56.03]And I've never been in a time loop before.
[14:57.37]I mean, I don't think I've been in a time loop before this one.
[15:00.87]Looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time's gone all weird.
[15:06.03]I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they died too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.
[15:21.83]Is he... He's not as concerned about this as he could be.
[15:26.53]What if he's going to land and smash his head on a rock?
[15:30.07]He's going to land and smash his head on this rock.
[15:32.00]Or should I tell him to stop playing the flute?
[15:33.46]Okay.
[15:42.14]Have you ever watched a cyclone for so long it started to hypnotize you?
[15:45.59]I'm telling you, they'll put you in a trance if you stare at them too long.
[15:51.01]You think the statues are recording our memories?
[15:53.09]I'm just holding my eyes open underwater, too.
[15:55.53]My eyes probably burning.
[16:15.58]You think the statue's recording our memories, then?
[16:17.24]Because I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny.
[16:22.31]That must be my memory friend.
[16:26.97]Huh.
[16:32.61]Uh, I found something.
[16:33.89]I found what happened to the orbital probe cannon.
[16:36.64]That's the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop, for real?
[16:39.80]Did you figure out why?
[16:40.50]Too much power, of course.
[16:44.35]Kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do.
[16:48.05]I'm pretty surprised to know if I built something that actually broke.
[16:51.19]Come to think of it, broke might be the wrong word, because it looks like the orbital probe cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each loop.
[17:01.66]So why just you and I are having a time loop?
[17:06.48]Alright, well, give me a tip.
[17:07.80]Do something you might like.
[17:09.24]At the start of every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop.
[17:14.44]Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.
[17:19.07]What else?
[17:19.59]What else?
[17:19.97]Have you been to the Statue Island?
[17:21.77]That's what I've been calling it, seeing as it's the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue.
[17:25.27]Get it?
[17:25.49]I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened.
[17:31.45]By the way, it's a nice beach for that kind of thing.
[17:33.87]I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro relaxation scale.
[17:38.40]If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it's the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch.
[17:42.46]I've already been there.
[17:43.04]I've already been there.
[17:47.06]Well, mostly connected anyway.
[17:48.08]You'll see.
[17:52.94]Where's your ship?
[17:54.48]Definitely on this planet somewhere.
[17:55.58]I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space.
[17:57.96]That would be pretty nuts.
[17:59.86]Hope it's not a lone one.
[18:01.64]We kind of already had that info.
[18:06.16]But at least I found Gabbro.
[18:13.24]Hmm.
[18:13.68]Hold on.
[18:13.98]I have to adjust my fucking body belt.
[18:19.14]There we go.
[18:19.46]That's better.
[18:21.95]Alright, cool.
[18:26.34]Joke incoming?
[18:27.18]No.
[18:30.28]Alright, so I know we... Let me go put this in just to have it done.
[18:33.14]Here we are.
[18:36.54]Put this away.
[18:44.75]Ah, we've completed it.
[18:46.81]So Gabbro goes this way, and this goes... Alright, cool.
[18:49.09]So this has been completed now.
[18:52.03]We have a full connection to this brain.
[18:58.87]So this is almost all done.
[19:01.49]This whole side is almost done.
[19:02.99]Unless there's something... Nothing's connecting from here.
[19:04.92]Yeah, this is almost completed over here.
[19:07.04]Okay.
[19:14.28]What have I not found over here?
[19:16.54]Sixth location.
[19:19.08]Right.
[19:19.28]I don't know why I was all fucked up on that.
[19:20.70]I don't know.
[19:26.20]Does he have any more info for me?
[19:31.60]What do you got?
[19:38.67]Uh, what are you doing out here?
[19:40.01]Well, what are any of us doing, really?
[19:41.23]No, I'm just kidding.
[19:41.83]I'm out here exploring the solo systems.
[19:44.81]Hmm.
[19:45.91]I'll tell you what, I'll just... Really, room to think.
[19:48.91]It's a quiet and peaceful out here.
[19:51.21]My ADHD is satisfied.
[19:54.25]It's usually quiet.
[19:54.97]Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my island.
[19:56.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:57.47]How's space treating you?
[19:58.21]Where should I explore?
[19:58.93]What's up with this planet?
[20:01.69]Ah, I know, right?
[20:03.97]That was just Yoshi.
[20:06.86]Oh, you mean, like, tell you more about it.
[20:08.42]I got you.
[20:08.80]Well, Giant's Deep is a massive, mostly water.
[20:11.66]No surprises there.
[20:13.14]There's a strong current a ways beneath the surface.
[20:15.26]Oh, I gotta go into the surface.
[20:16.56]I gotta go into the... Alright, I know where I'm going.
[20:19.92]I tried everything I could think to get past that current and neither idea worked.
[20:25.31]Alright, cool.
[20:35.19]I didn't skip the lore, it skipped it for me.
[20:37.90]It deleted me from the conversation.
[20:39.44]Trying to, like, take his spot.
[20:56.49]This is strange.
[20:57.57]Okay.
[20:57.89]What's up with this plant?
[21:00.24]Let's see it again.
[21:02.32]Tried everything.
[21:02.80]Ask for landmasses.
[21:03.56]Yeah, yeah.
[21:04.44]You've seen the cyclones.
[21:05.44]Yeah, they're hard to miss.
[21:07.28]They'll toss up everything in the path.
[21:08.58]Islands included.
[21:09.26]Little tip.
[21:09.68]You get picked up, try to land in water.
[21:11.28]It's not going to kill you.
[21:14.53]Okay.
[21:15.01]Got to find that thing to log in from.
[21:18.25]Speaking of ships, don't fucking... Come here.
[21:21.01]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[21:22.57]Alright.
[21:22.79]I have to get this out of the water.
[21:25.29]What did that do for me?
[21:27.63]Nothing.
[21:27.93]But there was... Oh, yep.
[21:29.21]Okay.
[21:30.67]The ocean depths.
[21:31.69]Hmm.
[21:35.53]The nomai on the construction saw something sink beneath the underwater current.
[21:38.92]Alright, I'm going for it.
[21:42.42]Let's see if I can go down there.
[21:45.16]Is something under the water?
[21:47.84]Exit ship to repair.
[21:50.13]Oh, wait.
[21:50.51]Hold on.
[21:54.43]Is this one of those shards in here?
[21:55.53]Remember?
[21:55.89]Like, here, look.
[21:57.95]There's a quantum fluctuation down in the middle of the Earth here.
[22:01.59]Earth, you know what I'm talking about.
[22:06.87]This way.
[22:11.17]There it is.
[22:11.61]Okay.
[22:12.11]It's inside the center.
[22:15.59]Can I just try to swim?
[22:16.49]Alright, I'm going for it.
[22:19.15]I'm just going to go for it.
[22:20.89]You know, you gotta... What the hell is that?
[22:25.95]You gotta go for it.
[22:26.53]I'm going for it.
[22:27.01]You know what I'm saying?
[22:33.24]Why am I stuck?
[22:35.04]Okay, do I have a fuel?
[22:41.50]Look, I'm dead anyways.
[22:42.48]Okay, here we go.
[22:45.82]Just sink to the bottom.
[22:54.33]Okay, so there's the current.
[22:57.05]Wait, I was inside of this thing.
[22:59.56]I was inside of that.
[23:00.38]Remember the electricity?
[23:02.38]I was inside of this.
[23:03.56]I was in there.
[23:06.32]I was inside of that.
[23:11.88]Okay, hold on.
[23:12.38]How do I get in there?
[23:19.23]unknown what's up here chip is gone it's alright I get a new one every day is this in the cyclone dude this thing is inside the cyclone
[23:46.93]go in?
[23:47.35]I don't think I can get in here.
[23:49.21]The current's too strong.
[23:51.41]I'm trying to go underneath it.
[24:01.84]I can't, like, push my body down.
[24:07.46]Let's see.
[24:10.16]Fly the ship in?
[24:10.88]I couldn't, um... Well, the ship sunk all the way to the bottom of the ocean, so...
[24:19.22]Come on.
[24:23.54]I can't move the ship down underwater, I thought.
[24:26.70]I tried to do that earlier.
[24:27.52]I thought it didn't work.
[24:32.24]Well, let's go get the ship.
[24:36.39]Wait, I'm like...
[24:48.39]Am I just sinking?
[24:57.51]It's so hard to tell even if I'm moving or not.
[25:01.90]I guess I'm going down?
[25:04.04]Am I?
[25:04.24]This is going further away.
[25:11.98]I'm going to try to get this ship.
[25:21.30]Check the tornadoes Yeah, I mean I know I know I'm just saying like it's besides that lower left indicator It's like kind of hard to know in what direction I'm facing Where the fuck is this thing going?
[25:47.73]Can I like turn this thing off?
[25:51.63]That's probably what's doing it.
[25:55.67]The ship is just gone.
[25:56.73]It just keeps going further and further away.
[25:59.26]The ship is now leaving.
[26:01.38]It's like trying to get away from me.
[26:14.11]The sun's about to explode.
[26:15.89]All I did was talk to the fucking guy on the beach.
[26:23.82]Which way is the current going?
[26:28.26]Which way is it going?
[26:30.40]Hard to see.
[26:38.51]This way?
[26:39.49]Forward?
[26:42.67]Am I moving with the current right now?
[26:47.77]I don't know.
[26:50.62]I guess...
[26:56.21]I mean, look at the globe.
[26:57.89]I'm moving.
[26:58.77]I guess I'm moving.
[27:02.66]Well, whatever.
[27:03.22]I'm going to see if I can go in there with the ship.
[27:15.35]Well, the sun's not going to explode, so it doesn't matter.
[27:25.25]Hello?
[27:25.77]What the hell?
[27:29.99]Where did I just go?
[27:30.91]We're in one of the tornadoes, I guess, and then out of the planet?
[27:40.43]This is a black hole?
[27:41.46]That was weird.
[27:43.26]Oh, I'm just going to try this again.
[27:46.02]Let's get this out of here.
[28:17.34]And the only new info I got was that I gotta go into the bottom of that planet.
[28:31.13]Dude, please stop the supernova joke.
[28:33.83]I can't, man.
[28:34.51]It gets laughs every time.
[28:38.87]You guys, if something's working, you gotta keep doing it.
[28:48.63]Okay.
[28:49.71]Let me see if there's anything else I could do.
[28:51.03]It's the, uh, Black Hole Forge.
[28:57.34]I still haven't done the Sun Station.
[29:00.12]Which was in... Remember I freaked out yesterday?
[29:02.39]The High Energy Lab.
[29:05.97]In the canyon at Ember Twin's Equator.
[29:07.85]I still haven't done that.
[29:10.09]White Hole Station.
[29:15.13]Strange.
[29:15.53]Warp dog.
[29:15.94]Just gonna drive.
[29:16.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:17.32]And then high energy lab.
[29:25.24]In the canyon at the Ember Twins equator.
[29:31.67]I feel like I've tried to go find that like five times.
[29:34.29]And every time I get distracted and go, what's this over there?
[29:37.35]I'm gonna try that.
[29:38.37]In the canyon.
[29:41.14]There's a lab in the canyon.
[29:48.82]I'm gonna try that.
[29:49.34]There's the moon.
[29:54.11]Alright, let's make progress now.
[30:02.35]Progress, progress, progress, progress.
[30:04.26]You have to remember the rule of the sixth location.
[30:10.68]I don't even know what that is.
[30:12.34]I don't know what the rule is.
[30:13.20]I don't think I figured that out yet.
[30:25.52]Alright, don't get a speeding ticket.
[30:26.94]Alright, in the canyon, there's... There's a lab in the canyon.
[30:46.17]Okay, where the cream in the cookie goes, that's the canyon, right?
[30:51.45]Let me make sure I get this figured out.
[31:05.93]It's apparently going too fast, again.
[31:07.77]I'm fine.
[31:14.55]So it's in- oh, just get out.
[31:15.53]Just get the fuck out.
[31:21.57]Hello?
[31:21.93]What's going on?
[31:22.49]Where am I?
[31:26.09]Why do I only see white spots?
[31:32.17]I couldn't move.
[31:33.91]I couldn't fucking move.
[31:35.61]Did I get out right when the dust storm landed on top of the ship?
[31:40.26]Hold on.
[31:41.16]I got out of the tank when the sand was touching across the ship.
[31:53.33]I got buried in sand like Minecraft.
[32:00.73]Okay.
[32:01.17]Again, I went too fast.
[32:02.48]You know what my biggest problem with me in this game is?
[32:07.02]Traveling to each... Like, traveling from here to a... Like, where's my teleport?
[32:13.66]I can only teleport to die and teleport back here.
[32:16.87]Why can I not die and teleport back somewhere else?
[32:18.91]Where's my memory stone?
[32:22.89]Like, I just want to go where I want to go and not fly.
[32:27.27]Space.
[32:27.70]This is a space game?
[32:41.26]immersion What is it space or something?
[32:52.05]Let's try this again
[33:11.30]Alright, I'm gonna coast in, Captain.
[33:15.22]Right into the fuckin' creamy center.
[33:19.54]That's where all the good stuff is.
[33:26.59]Want me to wink?
[33:27.19]That was fake?
[33:32.31]Fuck, whatever.
[33:32.95]Alright, there's a fuckin' lab here.
[33:43.37]I don't see what could be a lab.
[33:45.83]You know what I'm saying?
[33:50.90]Like, what's this secret lab?
[33:53.30]In there?
[33:59.19]Oh, fuck.
[33:59.87]Watch it.
[34:00.41]Watch it.
[34:00.89]Watch it.
[34:01.31]Watch out.
[34:01.73]Watch out for the giant death Minecraft trap.
[34:03.71]I'm just gonna land and I'll figure it out.
[34:15.74]Okay, I got turned around there.
[34:18.18]Because down is up and up is down right now.
[34:21.82]Here we go.
[34:28.42]Okay, here we are.
[34:29.58]Here's the canyon.
[34:33.03]Lab.
[34:33.91]Secret lab in the canyon.
[34:40.37]I've been in here.
[34:43.69]It's not there, though.
[34:56.66]I mean, this is... Is it... Did I just find it?
[34:59.12]Did I just find it?
[35:00.84]I think I just found it.
[35:02.26]This is like a weird staircase.
[35:03.24]I think I found it.
[35:03.68]Is this it?
[35:15.73]Secret lab?
[35:18.87]No.
[35:19.76]No.
[35:21.02]I've already been here.
[35:21.62]I think.
[35:24.70]Right?
[35:25.10]Haven't I?
[35:27.85]Holy fucking pog stairs.
[35:29.71]I think I've been here already.
[35:33.69]There's this weird thing here.
[35:41.65]I don't know.
[35:47.25]It seems like I could teleport from that.
[35:58.24]What's that?
[35:58.62]Okay, there's like a little bridge here.
[36:02.40]Alright, wait, wait for, wait for, wait for the Minecraft reaper to get the fuck out of the way.
[36:17.55]What's this?
[36:17.95]Have I been in here?
[36:20.39]No, I haven't.
[36:21.13]Found the secret lab.
[36:25.19]This door will need to remain closed for some time.
[36:27.39]Pie and I are running an experiment based on the extraordinary findings from the White Hall Station.
[36:34.49]Remy and I will be running this experiment until one of us, specifically me, can prove the other wrong.
[36:39.17]So although it's inconvenient, the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the Sunless City.
[36:46.54]The lab can only be accessed by the path from the Sunless City.
[36:51.13]Inviting sand inside would disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences.
[36:55.61]We realize this.
[36:57.13]It's an extreme... But the door must remain closed.
[37:03.09]An update.
[37:03.47]The High Energy Lab is now being used to design the Ash Twin Project.
[37:07.20]If you're here to help, or even just to observe, be sure to use the Sunless City path to the lab.
[37:11.58]Info.
[37:14.96]Bingo.
[37:16.78]High Energy Lab.
[37:18.89]Bingo.
[37:20.31]There's our Dark Souls shortcut that we can open eventually.
[37:24.07]Alright, Sunless City.
[37:26.16]Where's that?
[37:27.22]I gotta go look that up on my little thing.
[37:30.56]And I gotta get in there.
[37:31.94]Alright, Sunless City.
[37:35.92]I need my ship.
[37:36.86]I don't know where I am.
[37:38.86]I've been there once, but I don't know where that is.
[37:44.89]Ow.
[37:45.89]I just broke my teeth.
[37:47.71]Wait.
[37:48.47]Ow.
[37:51.23]I need one of those little block things.
[37:57.53]Is there one of those lying around?
[37:58.41]I don't see one.
[38:06.17]Slapstick in space.
[38:07.77]I don't see one lying... I have to carry one over here?
[38:12.56]Alright, well I got that info.
[38:16.41]Yeah, I love getting fucking info.
[38:18.61]Is this a space game?
[38:22.71]Dumb.
[38:24.87]It's on the- Wait, what?
[38:28.09]It's on the city.
[38:47.54]Oh, shit.
[38:49.26]This is the Sunless City, right here.
[38:59.94]Ghost!
[39:03.41]I just bro- what did I just do?
[39:06.87]What?
[39:07.15]No, I wanted to read that.
[39:08.23]What did that sign say?
[39:09.59]Read it quick!
[39:10.25]Well, I can still can.
[39:12.07]Crash site caves.
[39:21.65]I can't go in here.
[39:24.83]Sunless City.
[39:25.57]How do I get in here?
[39:26.38]How do you clear out a ghost?
[39:31.22]How do you clear a ghost?
[39:36.38]I have to go in here.
[39:37.22]There's like 10 in here.
[39:50.02]That looks like it's going down, not up.
[39:57.14]Hold on.
[40:00.79]How did I go this way?
[40:07.11]I'm on the other side?
[40:25.22]I've been in the Sunless City before.
[40:26.48]Yeah, but not this direction.
[40:30.05]Seems like a good way I can get in.
[40:31.27]Not from here.
[40:41.51]We were in the Sunless City before.
[40:42.89]Yeah, I just don't remember where or how I got in there.
[40:49.68]Uh, I'm gonna die if I don't go to my ship.
[40:56.47]It's hard to remember every location I've been to when all you do in this game is find new locations.
[41:13.23]It was fine.
[41:20.89]How do I repair the ship from outside?
[41:22.05]Do I have to be outside the ship?
[41:27.63]Do I have to do anything to repair it?
[41:29.53]Or is it just repair it?
[41:35.93]My reactor core is, like, broken, isn't it?
[41:37.61]Maybe not.
[41:39.38]Alright, let me go back over there.
[41:41.44]Let me just take... Let me browse.
[41:53.75]I just want to browse this canyon.
[42:07.28]It's just window shopping.
[42:08.80]Is there anything else I didn't do here?
[42:13.94]Like, what the hell is this?
[42:16.75]It's like that bridge.
[42:27.57]What's happening?
[42:28.79]What did I get stuck on?
[42:30.97]Alright, hold on.
[42:35.11]Tilt this way.
[42:41.57]Was this where I was before?
[42:42.93]It's inside.
[42:46.59]You're going to navigate inside the caves and shit, right?
[42:51.02]I think it is in here.
[43:00.96]Get out.
[43:01.24]If I remember, this is one of the ways to get in here.
[43:12.70]Alright.
[43:13.16]We got... Yeah, yeah.
[43:14.48]Okay, I remember this.
[43:16.64]So, is it up?
[43:18.78]Is it up or maybe... I don't know.
[43:22.06]I'm gonna try going up.
[43:40.36]Who?
[43:41.08]Have I been here?
[43:43.36]This is where... Okay, this is the Quantum Cactus place.
[43:45.10]I think I've been here already.
[43:48.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:49.45]I've seen this before.
[43:51.07]There's a rock in the cave here.
[43:52.51]Like, bed cave.
[43:53.23]Yeah, I've seen this already.
[43:54.03]This is like, please, if you can help, my... Somebody's missing.
[43:56.99]Yep.
[43:57.37]Alright.
[43:57.87]Hi.
[44:03.98]Other way.
[44:11.22]Can I go down there?
[44:16.71]Can I go down here?
[44:24.53]That's like a Mortal Kombat stage.
[44:26.87]No, that's death.
[44:27.57]I can't go down there.
[44:34.23]And then I end up back here with this bridge.
[44:40.08]Fuck.
[44:53.62]No.
[44:54.82]It's back there.
[44:55.82]Let me just check.
[44:59.64]No, no, no.
[45:01.22]I'm going to go deeper into the cave.
[45:11.13]I might be out of time though.
[45:13.97]Sand is coming.
[45:15.89]Sand is rising.
[45:21.32]Alright, I'm fine.
[45:26.04]Okay, bring it back.
[45:33.85]Come on, quantum.
[45:38.63]Alright, where the hell am I now?
[45:44.22]Alright.
[45:45.98]It wasn't this one, it was one more.
[45:50.16]Now I'm in... here.
[45:54.67]No, one more.
[45:55.17]Okay.
[45:56.69]Here we are.
[46:00.01]I gotta find this entrance from here.
[46:01.95]How much oxygen do I have?
[46:05.63]Yeah, friends, economy, sign, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:07.46]Okay, let's go.
[46:10.08]Now I'm in the cave system.
[46:14.32]Just a question of where the hell do I get through the Sunless City?
[46:19.37]No.
[46:19.85]What is this?
[46:26.13]No.
[46:28.31]Damn it.
[46:32.72]Oh, fuck.
[46:33.44]Oh, fuck.
[46:33.90]Oh, fuck.
[46:34.22]Oh, fuck.
[46:34.54]The nougat.
[46:35.60]Alright.
[46:36.00]I missed.
[46:36.46]Okay, good.
[46:46.65]Let's go up.
[46:55.16]Okay.
[46:57.10]Looking for- before the music starts to play and I run out of oxygen, I have to find this entrance to this sunless city.
[47:04.97]It's not here.
[47:05.65]I don't think it's here.
[47:11.66]Damn it.
[47:16.60]No.
[47:24.40]I'm reading chat.
[47:35.60]Let me try this one more time.
[47:36.78]Give me the rock.
[47:45.99]Oh, oh, oh, crack, crack, crack.
[47:48.65]Dude, I'm just like browsing around Twitch and I'm looking for a guy that's on crack every day.
[47:52.99]Am I in the right place?
[47:56.01]Yep.
[47:59.85]Yeah, I've already been in here.
[48:00.81]This rock only goes to three places.
[48:05.38]We've already done this part.
[48:06.64]Unless it's like I can't get out of here, right?
[48:14.12]No.
[48:14.34]No.
[48:22.34]Is this?
[48:23.54]No, it was here already.
[48:26.58]This is the place with the text, the original one.
[48:31.48]One, two, three, one.
[48:33.78]Wait!
[48:37.68]Wait, what?
[48:41.36]Hold on.
[48:43.53]How curious.
[48:43.91]This rock took me to a new location.
[48:45.55]I wonder why this happened.
[48:48.38]Curious, but also alarming.
[48:49.32]This new cave appears to lack an entrance or exit.
[48:51.38]Wait, no, I was already here.
[48:52.32]I already did this.
[49:03.57]How many locations are there, actually?
[49:04.85]Okay, come on.
[49:09.70]Quantum.
[49:12.56]Come on, quantum.
[49:14.92]Quantum!
[49:15.20]Quantum!
[49:18.27]Quantum?
[49:21.75]Qua... Quantum.
[49:28.08]Quick, quantum!
[49:28.82]Quick, quantum!
[49:30.10]Quick, quantum!
[49:31.70]Quick, quantum!
[49:49.65]Going out on my own terms.
[49:50.79]I'm just going to open one eye and just wait and look straight in the air. ...
[50:21.00]It's just an old 80s movie.
[50:22.78]I can see the laser beam coming.
[50:24.58]Is it going to kill me?
[50:25.08]Right in the eye.
[50:28.42]No, just move me out of the way.
[50:29.34]Alright, what do I die from first?
[50:31.69]Oxygen or a crushed head?
[50:46.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:47.44]Tyler wants to interview you.
[50:50.57]What do you mean interview?
[50:52.37]Alright, let's go.
[50:53.71]What do you want to know?
[50:54.45]What do you want to know?
[50:58.66]What do you got?
[51:03.24]It all started when I was eight.
[51:08.20]I saw a movie for the first time and I was like, that's what I want to do.
[51:12.26]That's what I'm thinking of.
[51:13.10]It was Ghostbusters 1.
[51:23.58]That's the Valve News Network.
[51:26.94]Oh, shit.
[51:29.46]Oh, I don't know why for a second I thought you were talking about like somebody in chat named Tyler wanted to interview me right now.
[51:38.94]Like, hey, I want to interview you.
[51:40.46]Okay.
[51:44.31]Yeah, whatever.
[51:46.17]Yeah, let's do it.
[51:47.51]That sounds fun.
[51:49.11]What do you want to interview me about?
[51:52.42]Please have it be what my favorite fucking restaurant in Vegas is.
[51:59.77]Yeah, I'll do that.
[52:00.41]That sounds fun.
[52:03.17]Just really important, though.
[52:04.99]I only do 22-minute interviews.
[52:11.44]I'm a very busy man.
[52:23.43]Ego fucking maniac.
[52:25.47]Nah, dude, whatever.
[52:26.81]Hit me up on a... Alright, you know what?
[52:29.15]Here, hit up one of the mods so I can get your contact info through Discord and we'll talk.
[52:36.11]No shitty jokes aside.
[52:37.71]Sounds like fun.
[52:46.29]I still can't fucking do this.
[52:48.27]Alright.
[52:49.97]This...
[52:53.97]There's more to explore in the Ash Twin Towers.
[52:59.76]Alright.
[53:00.48]I'm gonna... But I already know that this is somewhere.
[53:05.62]Path from the Sunless City.
[53:06.96]I need to get to the Sunless City.
[53:08.18]I don't know how to get to the Sunless City.
[53:16.65]Sun Station.
[53:17.45]No, I'm not going for Sun Station again.
[53:18.85]That's an embarrassment.
[53:20.41]You will be embarrassed for me.
[53:23.29]You know, people go like, oh, what's that thing when you're like embarrassed for somebody else?
[53:26.65]It's not you doing it.
[53:27.29]That's what you're going to have.
[53:29.11]I don't want to do that.
[53:31.04]What's it called?
[53:31.56]Like shot.
[53:33.00]What's it called?
[53:36.44]No, no, no.
[53:36.92]It's called something.
[53:38.26]It actually has like a scientific name.
[53:45.07]Schadenfreude.
[53:45.41]Schadenfreude.
[53:45.73]Yes.
[53:46.09]Schadenfreude.
[53:53.12]No, that's not it.
[53:53.74]That's laughing at somebody else's expense.
[53:55.80]No, that's wrong.
[53:56.28]It has a name.
[54:07.67]It's... Fransham.
[54:09.55]Fransham.
[54:10.19]Yeah, there you go.
[54:10.69]Somebody got it.
[54:11.19]It's like Fransham, right?
[54:14.67]Fransham.
[54:15.85]Fransham.
[54:18.57]How do I say it?
[54:19.21]No, that's actually correct.
[54:19.99]You actually have that correct.
[54:22.63]It's like Freundschaft.
[54:26.51]Yes, people are spelling it.
[54:27.65]However you say it.
[54:28.53]That's actually what it's called.
[54:33.49]I didn't make that up.
[54:34.55]I didn't make that up.
[54:37.03]That's the term.
[54:37.65]I knew there was a term for it.
[54:39.89]I don't know how to pronounce it.
[54:43.50]It's Jerma.
[54:44.44]Yeah.
[54:45.08]I think I said it kind of close.
[54:47.84]You made it up.
[54:51.37]I'm going a thousand miles per hour!
[54:53.21]This happens when I'm arguing about something and I'm holding the left stick up.
[55:13.22]It's not imperial.
[55:14.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:15.62]It's all I know, okay?
[55:17.08]You can make fun of me all you want, but it's what I know.
[55:22.15]I'm going to drive into the sun.
[55:23.45]First sun joke of the night.
[55:24.53]Here it comes.
[55:25.77]Everyone's been waiting for it.
[55:26.93]Here it is.
[55:28.39]The first laugh out loud.
[55:29.77]He went into the sun joke.
[55:31.01]I have to explore the tower on the ashtray.
[55:44.45]First Darkwood trap.
[55:45.93]Yeah.
[55:46.61]Coming up.
[55:49.17]Okay.
[55:50.51]There's more to explore on this, like, right here, for instance.
[55:54.42]Mud and hot.
[55:56.82]25 meters per second.
[55:58.50]5 meters per second.
[55:59.96]Landing activated.
[56:03.41]Perfect landing.
[56:04.95]Get out.
[56:06.79]Get out, you stupid...
[56:10.69]Alright, what do we got?
[56:12.13]We have this big tower.
[56:13.59]I was gonna say 5G, but that's a very easy joke to make, and people would probably not think it was funny, so somebody else is gonna say it in the chat.
[56:20.26]I know they are.
[56:22.04]Get on top of it.
[56:26.02]Well.
[56:27.82]Uh.
[56:29.23]Okay.
[56:32.49]Oh.
[56:34.99]That's unfortunate.
[56:35.81]Okay.
[56:44.89]What about quantum reading?
[56:46.29]Wait.
[56:46.51]Oh, there's a church.
[56:47.75]Cave shard.
[56:49.48]Distressed beacon.
[56:51.20]Wait, escape pod 2.
[56:51.94]Oh, I already did that.
[56:54.98]Okay, whatever.
[56:56.94]Can I get anywhere else here?
[57:02.79]Looking for... I need to explore this tower again while there's time.
[57:08.99]Watch out.
[57:09.57]This is how it's made.
[57:10.47]How they make a Snickers bar.
[57:12.58]Yep.
[57:16.03]There it is.
[57:22.01]Which one?
[57:22.51]I got minused to that one.
[57:28.80]That was a solid reference to, like, 20 minutes ago.
[57:32.86]I can't believe I'm getting minused here.
[57:35.60]I can't fucking believe it.
[57:46.06]I got a tough, tough crowd tonight.
[57:52.92]I need a reader.
[58:00.15]Reader?
[58:00.41]I need one of those wall readers.
[58:08.61]There's a wall reader.
[58:18.99]Need a wall reader.
[58:19.71]Wait.
[58:22.26]Is there a reader in here?
[58:27.44]I think this door is sealed up.
[58:30.44]It is.
[58:30.86]I gotta get in here another way?
[58:32.20]What?
[58:36.58]What about the bottom?
[58:39.50]Up here?
[58:39.82]Alright, here we go.
[58:46.63]I have a reader here.
[58:48.23]Have I read this one?
[58:51.33]Some time has passed since I checked in with you, Kai.
[58:53.17]How are you on the idea of progressing with the sun station?
[58:55.55]I'm very settled.
[58:56.13]The plan will either fail explosively or succeed explosively.
[59:00.40]Kai, you know I don't find that funny.
[59:03.50]Hypothesis, time spent away from the station would be beneficial to you both.
[59:07.98]I'm immensely interested in testing your hypothesis, Yaya.
[59:13.86]That at least we can agree on.
[59:19.41]I'm curious, Rami.
[59:21.05]Rami thinks I'm a gas, and I don't recall requesting that you monitor this conversation.
[59:27.47]Why is this so loud?
[59:32.34]Why is the sand so loud?
[59:37.30]In this room, in particular.
[59:41.14]I don't see what state of matter you are has to do with this, and I don't recall supporting the Sun Station's construction, but here we are.
[59:49.09]Alright.
[59:50.23]I did have some new info there.
[59:51.27]Alright, where's my, uh... Take this out.
[59:53.91]See what this one says.
[59:54.55]Alright, what's this?
[60:00.96]Yes.
[60:11.42]I became lost on Ember Twin.
[60:14.40]My gratitude that raped me found me, but the high energy lab is the building with the large solar panels.
[60:19.88]I'm surprised I didn't see it.
[60:20.90]I already went in it, though.
[60:22.85]I imagine our otherwise immensely clever Konoi would lose his own head if it weren't for Automatically Impossible.
[60:30.79]I already went into the high energy lab, didn't I?
[60:35.49]Two large solar panels.
[60:38.23]Wait a minute.
[60:39.80]Are they quantum cactuses?
[60:45.67]Alright, is this like a flappy bird experiment here?
[60:47.65]Can I get in here?
[60:50.65]Can I float in there?
[60:51.49]Holy fuck, it is!
[61:06.31]It actually is!
[61:06.83]It actually is!
[61:08.33]No, no, no, patch it, patch it, patch it.
[61:10.33]Come on!
[61:11.67]No!
[61:12.15]I thought you guys were bullshitting me.
[61:15.47]Oh, come on.
[61:16.61]I can't believe that you actually can do that.
[61:20.95]Wow.
[61:21.67]Alright, I didn't... I didn't know it was that far.
[61:27.29]Shit.
[61:28.29]Okay.
[61:30.17]What is up there?
[61:31.94]Now I need to know what's up there.
[61:40.11]Damn it.
[61:40.65]I can't believe I didn't get up there.
[61:42.32]Oh, that's so sad.
[61:45.56]What's inside that?
[61:46.68]I don't know.
[61:47.22]That's what I need to know.
[61:48.24]I'm going back.
[61:54.58]Shit.
[62:05.70]Why did Omega Lull get removed?
[62:09.78]It is?
[62:10.00]What do you mean omegalo?
[62:14.32]Oh, you're doing the thing where everyone now has to write it because... That's so stupid.
[62:19.60]Everyone's gonna write it now.
[62:21.04]Wait, why did omegalo get removed?
[62:23.08]Everyone's like, wait, did it?
[62:23.94]Let me check.
[62:25.70]I gotta check.
[62:32.47]That's the oldest trick in the book, too.
[62:39.59]Where am I going?
[62:42.09]Just use autopilot.
[62:43.77]It's the safest way as long as there's no sun.
[62:50.82]Autopilot's going a little fast.
[62:53.52]I'm not doing this.
[62:57.28]Alright, let me get back.
[63:11.75]Come on, let's go, come on.
[63:14.67]Come on, what the fuck?
[63:16.31]Okay.
[63:26.74]Foot branding.
[63:42.38]Did I miss anything else on this planet?
[63:45.56]What?
[63:45.68]Oh, shit.
[63:46.06]Is there nothing else on this planet that I can't see?
[63:52.33]Sweat check?
[63:53.15]Not at all, actually.
[63:55.39]Zero.
[63:58.13]I'm good to go.
[63:59.63]Alright, I went... Remember I did this and I went... And then I went this way.
[64:17.73]What is this?
[64:18.19]Is it buried?
[64:20.15]It's probably a ship or something.
[64:24.49]It's coming out.
[64:33.30]Oh.
[64:34.64]The more the sand drops...
[64:38.80]The surface goes down right.
[64:43.00]Okay, that's interesting.
[64:48.91]I didn't know that was happening.
[64:50.77]It took him 10 hours to notice that.
[64:52.89]That's like the second time I've been on this planet.
[64:57.22]Yeah, it took me 10 hours to notice.
[64:59.22]I've been here twice.
[65:15.29]What's going on over here?
[65:19.16]Hmm.
[65:20.52]Hmm.
[65:21.36]Hmm.
[65:23.48]Hmm.
[65:23.88]Hmm.
[65:25.72]I'm almost out of fuel.
[65:31.04]Uh, I'm gonna give it.
[65:31.82]I'm gonna give it.
[65:39.76]Watch out.
[65:40.14]Don't get in there.
[65:59.79]What happened?
[66:00.83]Now it's on the other planet.
[66:02.63]Fuck.
[66:03.11]Come on, man.
[66:05.49]Come back to me.
[66:07.87]Why does it happen to me all the time?
[66:12.26]Oh, well.
[66:13.50]Just don't use that much fuel.
[66:17.08]Jump over to it.
[66:17.98]No.
[66:20.48]There ain't shit on this whole planet.
[66:23.28]Look at all the ground I've covered on the map.
[66:26.44]Ain't nothing even here.
[66:48.87]It's because I have to wait.
[66:51.55]I should never come here immediately.
[66:54.64]Because the sand is too high.
[66:56.48]I can't do anything.
[66:57.24]Let's just ski around the planet.
[67:07.95]Not too far.
[67:08.77]Okay, there we go.
[67:10.55]Going over here.
[67:18.96]Okay, here we are again.
[67:20.36]Back at the North Pole.
[67:24.55]Alright, let's go this way.
[67:29.87]Save the fuel.
[67:31.47]Well, I mean, this whole run is just a wash anyways.
[67:46.02]Not if you're good.
[67:49.36]Alright, here we go.
[67:50.86]So right in the equator is where this is.
[67:53.62]Is this where the cactus trap is?
[68:06.41]Hold on.
[68:08.31]What is this?
[68:10.57]Oh, this shit's getting revealed now to... Wait, can I go in this window?
[68:16.15]I can.
[68:16.43]Alright, so is there anything up here that I need to look at?
[68:20.98]What's up here?
[68:21.40]Have I been up here?
[68:27.11]No, I've been here, yeah.
[68:29.41]This is where that is.
[68:31.15]Fuel's almost gone.
[68:31.97]Alright, so how long have I been walking around on this planet?
[68:41.97]So don't ever come here unless it's been at least like five to ten minutes.
[68:45.27]Alright.
[68:57.18]There's a cactus room.
[68:58.14]No fuel for the cactus room.
[69:00.35]Well... Let me... Where is this on the map?
[69:04.41]I know that... No fuel here?
[69:06.65]Nobody left it in for me?
[69:08.75]Oh, we're dead.
[69:09.21]So we might as well just end it.
[69:15.30]Alright, that's running the equator.
[69:27.18]I'm going to land the ship there after I do something else.
[69:29.93]In like 10 minutes.
[69:30.89]Because that's how long it takes for that building to show.
[69:33.01]I'm going to go back to what I was doing before.
[69:55.62]Back into the canyon.
[69:57.72]Try to find this sunless city.
[70:01.22]Sunless city.
[70:07.13]Yes.
[70:09.51]Yes.
[70:29.86]Do a third cactus in a row.
[70:31.52]Let's go.
[70:31.96]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[70:35.42]I've been to the city once already.
[70:36.67]I just don't remember.
[70:37.53]It was just in-game time.
[70:39.65]I just don't remember.
[70:41.55]I had... There was that sign that I saw, too.
[70:43.93]Uh...
[71:01.62]Mark it on the map.
[71:18.09]Rhinoceros beetle brain.
[71:22.73]That's incredibly specific animal.
[71:26.00]Why a rhinoceros beetle?
[71:29.16]That's very specific.
[71:36.88]Alright, let's go.
[71:38.18]So I'm looking for... What am I looking for again?
[71:50.57]Not there.
[71:56.77]Up here, right?
[72:04.14]Is that staircase?
[72:24.09]No, please put me back in put me back in quick put me back in quick put me back in quick Put me back in.
[72:30.23]Oh my god.
[72:31.37]No Why couldn't I go back in?
[72:34.10]Oh My fuck I'm so mad right now you have no idea I'm so fucking mad
[72:49.04]Why couldn't I come back?
[72:49.88]Why wouldn't it put me back in?
[72:51.68]Why wouldn't it put me back in?
[72:52.56]Why wouldn't it put me back in?
[72:56.16]Fuck.
[72:56.36]I'm so mad.
[72:57.60]I can't believe it.
[73:03.84]No suit.
[73:06.52]No suit.
[73:08.34]One.
[73:08.88]Cactus, two.
[73:09.84]Sun, zero.
[73:10.68]We're on a roll tonight.
[73:13.22]We're on a roll, ladies and gentlemen.
[73:14.88]A roll, I tell you.
[73:16.32]God damn it.
[73:17.46]What a pain in the ass.
[73:22.08]Put the suit on, and why can't I just permanently be in the suit?
[73:27.48]And I tried- I instantly fucking knew, and I tried instantly, instantly, within an instant to get back in.
[73:33.41]It didn't work.
[73:35.09]I can't- apparently you have to have the suit on to get beamed up.
[73:56.57]Sun, zero.
[73:58.35]Oh, I'm so mad.
[74:00.27]Alright, settle down, settle down.
[74:01.70]I'm just gonna go back to that thing.
[74:02.94]I'm so angry.
[74:06.48]Like, I'm not even, I'm not comedy angry right now.
[74:09.02]I'm, like, pissed off angry.
[74:16.05]You know, there's, like, there's, like, comedy angry and there's, like, fucking, I'm, like, mad.
[74:20.93]I think I crossed the comedy anger threshold right now.
[74:27.96]Okay.
[74:29.02]Put your stupid suit on.
[74:30.44]I love how I have to put the suit on, but I can't take the suit off.
[74:36.62]Like, in space.
[74:38.57]Why can't I just rip the helmet off?
[74:43.55]I got it on.
[74:52.11]Okay.
[74:53.21]So this is the lab, right?
[74:55.29]Can I get anywhere from here?
[74:57.19]I don't know.
[75:02.75]Did I fully explore this place?
[75:03.87]Gate pod 2.
[75:09.48]Yeah, it's gate pod 3.
[75:10.38]We already looked at this.
[75:14.60]We did already see this.
[75:17.92]Just making sure I don't miss anything.
[75:23.45]Alright.
[75:28.03]We've already seen this.
[75:31.85]Okay.
[75:34.55]Ah.
[75:36.91]Enormous cavern.
[75:37.75]Yep.
[75:38.67]Long shelter.
[75:40.85]Wait, hold on.
[75:43.17]Shelter site.
[75:45.81]Where's the big scary thing?
[75:48.57]I have to investigate that.
[75:49.49]It was this way.
[75:58.53]Now this is the oxygen place.
[76:07.16]Wait, do I have to go through this again?
[76:08.50]Hold on.
[76:13.30]Where's the monster?
[76:15.76]Emergency escape path.
[76:17.44]There's nothing in the industry, but there's rocks, okay.
[76:19.80]It's this one, right?
[76:21.62]Yeah, right, okay.
[76:25.05]This can be investigated more.
[76:38.50]I can drop down from somewhere into here.
[76:40.62]Okay.
[76:46.90]Alright, let's go.
[76:58.45]Found a shortcut hole.
[76:59.53]I already did?
[77:03.48]Did I find the shortcut hole already?
[77:10.77]Wait, very early on I did.
[77:12.89]What?
[77:15.51]You found a shortcut yesterday.
[77:18.63]Out here.
[77:19.19]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:20.75]Yeah, out here.
[77:21.37]No, you're right.
[77:23.19]I did.
[77:26.19]Yeah, I think I know where that is.
[77:27.13]I think.
[77:28.63]It's out around here, isn't it?
[77:34.53]It's somewhere like out here.
[77:39.88]Didn't I poke my head out or something?
[77:41.42]It was like digging up in Minecraft.
[77:42.96]Where was it?
[77:51.03]I distinctly remember that happening for some reason.
[77:54.83]I don't remember where it was, though.
[77:57.45]Oh.
[78:11.60]Oh, where the hell was that?
[78:18.38]I don't remember.
[78:18.90]I just really don't.
[78:19.70]There's so much information in this game.
[78:21.16]I have no idea where that is.
[78:22.34]Let me refuel.
[78:32.87]Ugh.
[78:36.63]I do remember, though, poking my head out somewhere...
[78:44.77]I remember being like, oh, here I am.
[78:46.57]I think.
[78:50.27]It's not like right around here or something, right?
[78:51.91]I don't know.
[78:58.30]I don't, I have no idea.
[79:02.24]Not a single clue.
[79:08.90]It's like a shortcut or something.
[79:16.03]I don't know.
[79:16.65]I don't know.
[79:18.62]I don't know.
[79:19.32]I don't know.
[79:20.26]I don't know.
[79:31.69]Go look at the VOD.
[79:50.96]Okay, it's right there, but where do I go from here?
[80:20.84]Oh, I'm gonna poo my fucking... I can't... Wait, this is... Didn't I open this?
[80:27.23]This is not it?
[80:30.97]That's not it?
[80:32.51]I... Didn't I open that?
[80:36.25]No.
[80:40.12]No.
[80:41.70]Damn it.
[80:42.06]Let me try going this way.
[80:49.32]Be down here?
[80:53.31]Where's the sand?
[81:07.42]No!
[81:09.40]Wait, big bits came in.
[81:11.12]Oh shit, they did.
[81:13.54]Daddy Umbra gave 10,000 bits.
[81:19.53]Thanks for the $100.
[81:20.03]And is this like a... What is this emote?
[81:23.86]PJ Salt.
[81:25.18]I thought that was a toilet.
[81:29.98]Thanks for the 10,000 bits, dude.
[81:34.21]They say my socks were hard to put on today.
[81:36.23]Thanks a lot, Jeremy.
[81:38.35]Did you just get out of the shower and then try to put your socks on?
[81:40.31]What a mistake that was.
[81:44.12]That was your biggest mistake.
[81:49.32]You gotta be more careful, but thanks for the hundred dollars.
[81:52.06]That's a shitload of money.
[81:58.02]Thanks for the fucking massive, massive money drop.
[82:03.60]Putting on socks while your feet are wet is impossible.
[82:11.66]And then we just had five community subs too from SuperBruce.
[82:13.85]Thank you, SuperBruce.
[82:14.53]I have no idea.
[82:14.91]Tell me where to go.
[82:15.45]I don't care.
[82:17.13]Like, literally tell me where to go.
[82:18.55]I'm never going to find this.
[82:19.49]You know I won't.
[82:20.71]I will never find this.
[82:34.66]He doesn't care.
[82:35.96]I mean, I'm not going to find... I'm not going to remember where this is.
[82:41.76]You got, like, 10 planets, 60 locations on each planet.
[82:46.30]That's 600 locations.
[82:48.43]And then you got, like, on each 600 locations, you got 20 dialog options.
[82:53.31]We're talking about, like, 12,000 places in my brain.
[82:55.58]I don't know where they are.
[83:10.27]Okay, go to the Gravity Cannon.
[83:13.66]Is that even on this planet?
[83:16.66]Is the Gravity Cannon even on this planet?
[83:18.30]Alright, let me go with my ship.
[83:28.63]Let me go to the ship.
[83:29.29]Let me go to the ship.
[83:46.70]You're already out of time.
[83:47.64]So it's the gravity cannon.
[83:51.56]Where's that fucking gravity cannon?
[83:55.69]That's the thing.
[83:56.27]That's like the broken thing.
[83:57.39]Yeah, I think I know what it looks like.
[83:58.81]I just don't know where it is.
[84:05.71]Okay.
[84:07.11]There it is.
[84:08.25]So this, the Dark Souls shortcut was here.
[84:11.18]I never would have found this.
[84:13.80]No way.
[84:14.42]Not in a thousand years.
[84:18.94]I never would have remembered it.
[84:22.46]You just saved... Like, at least an hour or two of this stream.
[84:28.63]Thank you, guys.
[84:29.93]Another $100 from Daddy Umbra.
[84:32.59]10,000 more bits.
[84:37.17]$200 total now in bits from Daddy Umbra.
[84:40.19]Jerma, make a joke or I'll send more.
[84:44.92]What?
[84:49.57]Make a joke or I'll send more.
[84:54.15]Why don't I just be quiet?
[85:01.29]You just told me if I don't say anything, then you'll just spend more money.
[85:12.18]Well, to make it so you don't spend any more money...
[85:16.12]I don't even have a joke right now.
[85:17.86]I don't have anything to say.
[85:20.36]I'm desperately trying to find this city.
[85:41.72]This is the... Okay, remember this is the quantum cactus?
[85:46.70]No.
[85:50.17]No.
[85:50.49]No quantum cactus here.
[85:51.41]Wait.
[85:52.03]Can I close this?
[85:57.29]Damn it.
[86:01.03]Is it further down?
[86:02.79]Is it all the way down?
[86:08.71]Yo, this dude is crazy.
[86:15.30]Above the door.
[86:30.33]Like, you mean up there.
[86:32.85]Like, not even going in the cannon.
[86:36.91]It's above the door.
[86:39.66]So, like, up here.
[86:48.17]I never would have found this.
[86:49.27]Never.
[86:50.39]Never would have found it.
[86:52.57]Never would have found it.
[86:56.47]Alright.
[86:56.87]Remember where this is.
[86:58.73]How do I mark this?
[87:04.72]Found it last stream.
[87:08.46]Yeah.
[87:09.68]And that's fine.
[87:11.14]But I've also found a lot of other things last stream.
[87:16.17]Yeah, I need like a team of 10 people to all have a different planet in their brain.
[87:21.38]I gotta hire people to remember what happened on each planet.
[87:24.78]You're the Brittle Hollow guy!
[87:29.08]Oh, wait, hold on.
[87:29.62]This is important.
[87:30.32]Okay, there's no ghost over there.
[87:41.45]There's a ghost right there, though.
[87:48.78]Okay, I'm going to go that way.
[87:55.37]What?
[87:55.81]Alright, now let's go there.
[88:08.68]Okay.
[88:10.00]Made it.
[88:18.21]Yeah, this fills with sand.
[88:20.71]Oh, it's already filling with sand.
[88:21.93]Remember where that was.
[88:24.07]Big cannon right above the door.
[88:25.09]Yeah, okay.
[88:37.61]I can come here later.
[88:40.20]I'm gonna come here immediately.
[88:42.56]Go right to the cannon.
[88:43.70]Go right in.
[88:48.39]You gotta get here insanely fast.
[88:50.17]Yeah.
[88:51.63]I will.
[88:52.23]Now I remember where this is.
[88:53.27]It's not gonna take me 100 years to get here.
[88:57.61]I'm gonna break my fucking neck on the ceiling.
[89:10.52]The sand and the neck breaking is the loudest sounds in the whole game.
[89:27.27]Daddy Umbra again.
[89:28.25]You're at $250 worth of bits.
[89:35.61]25,000 bits.
[89:36.50]Jerma, do you love us?
[89:40.40]I love this whole community.
[89:45.08]I think everybody's great.
[89:48.22]Do I love each individual, every single individual one of you?
[89:52.38]Now that I cannot say.
[89:53.98]I don't know you individually.
[89:55.80]I know you collectively.
[89:57.65]As a group.
[89:58.03]I don't know.
[90:02.61]It could be a serial killer watching right now.
[90:09.79]I can't make that kind of statement.
[90:16.96]Alright, let's do it.
[90:18.86]I got the suit on, I know where I'm going.
[90:27.08]One of you could be embezzling millions of dollars into, like, offshore bank accounts or something.
[90:31.29]Like, I... I can't say that.
[90:44.81]Through donations.
[90:50.82]Alright, let's get in there quick.
[91:02.61]No, I love this community.
[91:04.81]I love this place.
[91:05.81]I love this space here.
[91:07.58]I think it's a lot of fun.
[91:08.24]I think it's great.
[91:28.10]Alright, where's that cannon?
[91:28.92]Where's that cannon?
[91:29.62]Where's the cannon?
[91:30.24]Cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon.
[91:32.74]Cannon.
[91:33.46]Cannon.
[91:34.24]Cannon.
[91:34.66]Where's the cannon?
[91:35.66]Cannon.
[91:36.00]Where's that cannon?
[91:38.24]What's that?
[91:38.58]Have I ever seen that?
[91:40.92]No.
[91:41.30]Focus.
[91:49.83]Here we go.
[92:06.95]Nice.
[92:08.33]Nice, dude.
[92:09.59]Nice.
[92:19.22]Okay, let's go.
[92:21.22]Gee, I'm so fucking nervous right now.
[92:23.23]God.
[92:24.55]Shake.
[92:24.79]Shake around a little bit.
[92:26.61]Move.
[92:27.05]God.
[92:27.65]Fuck.
[92:27.99]Okay.
[92:28.39]No.
[92:28.81]Fuck.
[92:29.13]I'm okay.
[92:30.41]Go down here.
[92:31.17]Okay, slow down.
[92:35.60]Alright, we got... We have some info.
[92:39.14]Anglerfish Overlook District.
[92:42.42]Stepping Stone District.
[92:44.74]High Energy Lab Trailhead.
[92:45.96]High Shrine District.
[92:53.75]Knowledge.
[92:55.47]Should we build the Sun Station to power the Astrin Project?
[93:00.38]Are there other ways to generate this level of power?
[93:02.32]I figured out the story.
[93:26.82]Unsurprisingly, I disagree.
[93:28.14]We're pushing a possible new technology further than ever before.
[93:32.38]They tap into the sun with the sun station, and they do this fucking weird... They're trying to make a new energy source, or they're trying to go forward in time or backwards in time, and they use the power from the sun, which makes the sun supernova putting into a time... It's the sun explodes because they tapped into it.
[93:47.37]I get it.
[93:48.87]If we fail, and probably the... We would question destroy ourselves and our life here.
[93:57.91]Potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe.
[94:00.69]We shouldn't build the sun station.
[94:02.87]If we were going to build one, where would it be?
[94:05.74]Fear of failure is a poor reason not to try.
[94:07.48]I believe if we're cautious, the sun station will work.
[94:11.84]Oh, I'm deeply honored.
[94:12.74]I comprehend your position.
[94:14.08]If we aren't all but certain that it will not cause destruction once we've built it, then I won't support the station's use.
[94:21.86]Alright.
[94:23.28]Now what?
[94:24.57]These are... Oh.
[94:26.61]Wait.
[94:31.82]What's down here?
[94:32.30]High energy lab.
[94:46.37]Yeah, alright.
[94:51.37]Hold on.
[94:53.83]Alright, sand's coming.
[94:54.55]Sand's coming.
[94:55.63]Sand's coming.
[94:56.07]Let's go.
[95:00.27]I can teleport.
[95:00.95]Okay, I'm gonna come back here every day.
[95:02.29]What else is in here?
[95:10.04]I gotta follow the trail, I guess.
[95:20.37]I... I guess we're gonna follow this?
[95:25.55]Um, okay.
[95:26.15]Can't do that.
[95:26.77]Um, can I...
[95:39.53]Did I take too long?
[95:46.38]Is there a place I can jump through?
[95:47.50]Oh, shit.
[95:54.66]Hold on.
[95:54.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:04.13]Is it going to crush my head?
[96:08.89]This is gonna crush my head.
[96:12.85]Can I actually do this?
[96:14.45]I'm gonna try.
[96:15.89]Alright, if it's a failure, don't matter.
[96:16.99]I'm gonna teleport back anyways.
[96:18.15]Come on, hurry up.
[96:33.08]Does this actually go over the lip?
[96:36.12]What?
[96:40.92]Ceiling's far away.
[96:41.68]Okay, now I'm gonna go... One, two, three, go.
[96:49.10]Really?
[96:50.90]Really?
[96:52.81]Really?
[96:53.07]Alright, hold on.
[96:58.73]Keep going.
[97:01.47]What?
[97:03.51]What?
[97:04.03]No!
[97:04.65]What?
[97:04.91]Hold on.
[97:06.24]Wait.
[97:06.56]Go this way.
[97:09.72]Oh, no!
[97:12.51]Go, go, go, quick!
[97:19.37]Oh!
[97:21.77]Oh!
[97:23.01]I did it!
[97:23.37]Where the hell am I?
[97:31.94]Oh my goodness, where am I going?
[97:37.86]Uh... Keep following this trail?
[97:42.75]Oh, wait, what's over here?
[97:44.57]Don't go in it yet.
[97:45.89]Three minutes till oxygen explodes.
[97:47.19]What?
[97:53.77]But there's stuff over here.
[97:54.79]Is there anything over here?
[97:56.37]Alright, not worth it.
[97:57.94]I'm going up.
[98:07.86]Huh?
[98:17.23]What?
[98:17.73]Where am I going?
[98:19.53]Where am I going?
[98:22.07]Oh.
[98:27.27]Oh.
[98:29.44]Oh, go, go, go.
[98:33.52]Why into that?
[98:41.30]oh alright I I did it I think I did it or something oh I did it okay I made it what do I do what's this thing what's that do what are these are these special these special buttons warp core warp core warp core how many different warp cores are there
[99:08.22]Is there a secret?
[99:08.64]This has got to be like a... Hold on.
[99:09.76]This is probably going to be like a... Open a door or something?
[99:13.07]Come on.
[99:14.31]I have to be able to open a door.
[99:15.71]Write this glass?
[99:16.47]Can I shatter the glass?
[99:18.15]Read.
[99:19.75]Record show Nomai arriving at the warp receiver on Brillo Hollow very slightly before departing on the Whitehall Station.
[99:26.75]Remy and I are devising an experiment to test if this is a real phenomenon or simply machine error.
[99:33.45]Initial things first, our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white hole core to mimic the setup on the white hole station.
[99:43.10]Clown brain.
[99:49.84]Setup will first pair a small black hole with a small white hole.
[99:57.22]It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole.
[100:04.73]theory what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its destination the are you talking about man
[100:26.21]An update.
[100:26.67]Our experiment here reproduced the anomaly in arrival and departure times, but Pi is unconvinced that it's more than an equipment error.
[100:35.78]I hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes.
[100:43.35]To that end, we decided to try adding more energy.
[100:45.85]I imagine the sunless city's energy supply should prove sufficient.
[100:52.29]All available energy has been rerouted from the way to have room to our experiment.
[100:59.26]Remy and I are about to run a new test.
[101:04.06]Hypothesis confirmed.
[101:06.54]Hypothesis confirmed.
[101:07.40]I saw it.
[101:07.92]I saw it.
[101:08.32]Hypothesis confirmed.
[101:10.96]Is this a Jerma stream?
[101:15.94]We just said the same thing four times in a row.
[101:20.05]This is beyond extraordinary.
[101:21.67]This changes everything.
[101:23.25]What a beautiful day for the intersection of abstract theory and practical application.
[101:31.67]Hypothesis train.
[101:32.45]I'd hate to leave him in the dark.
[101:34.08]New info.
[101:34.38]Okay, now the question is...
[101:47.62]Oh, there's a... Wait, press this button.
[102:04.00]What did I just do?
[102:07.46]We're at full power.
[102:09.18]Oh man, there's more.
[102:13.54]The Southern Observatory is asking if creating a 22-minute interval is possible.
[102:18.65]That is, to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the warp.
[102:28.08]That's just enough time for Jerma to do an interview.
[102:35.02]We've learned the negative interval of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core.
[102:43.24]Problematically, the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate.
[102:47.50]Creating a 22-minute long interval is possible, but we are currently unable to generate the necessary energy.
[102:57.26]The energy is currently unavailable, you say.
[102:59.16]You're a gas pie.
[103:00.26]Remy and I believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy.
[103:07.61]A thrilling but enormous undertaking.
[103:09.55]We would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy.
[103:16.50]Wait, we're getting... We're getting to... You know, you watch the first six episodes of the anime, and you go, wow, this is actually pretty interesting shit.
[103:25.60]This is cool.
[103:26.66]And then you're at, like, the middle ten episodes of the anime, and it just kind of goes off the rails in your head.
[103:32.82]And they add a bunch of shit, and I don't... Like, season two turns it upside down.
[103:42.73]Oh, wait, hold on.
[103:43.13]I said the word anime.
[103:43.69]I forgot.
[103:44.55]I forgot.
[103:47.40]Sorry about that.
[103:50.50]Don't ever say the word anime.
[103:52.75]Someone will be very angry with you.
[104:10.54]It's like just an automatic reaction.
[104:13.39]You could be eating a bowl of macaroni and cheese, and if you hear the word anime, some of you guys, it's like... How dare you!
[104:27.85]The Ash Twin Project will be one of our biggest undertakings.
[104:31.49]Metaphorically and physically.
[104:32.67]To build it, we need a way to travel quickly between Ash Twin and each location that holds crucial project materials.
[104:46.11]He just got punched in the stomach.
[104:56.19]I can't laugh that hard because it's hurting me, but that's funny.
[105:02.49]Give that guy a fucking gold- I wish I could give gold stars.
[105:05.01]Twitch has the VIP system.
[105:10.17]But that's, like, kinda too much.
[105:11.23]I just, I want, like, a temporary, a temporary, like, that I can put on someone.
[105:16.63]That only lasts, like, 30 minutes.
[105:21.69]Because if you VIP somebody, they're like, oh, that's a very important person for the stream.
[105:24.88]You don't, like, remove the VIP.
[105:27.28]I want a system where I can, like, place a dunce cap on them, yeah?
[105:31.92]And be like, you just, you said, I like what you said.
[105:34.74]It's, like, a 10-minute thing.
[105:37.70]Dunce cap.
[105:38.33]Yeah.
[105:42.88]And then their text is kind of lit up for like five minutes.
[105:45.99]That would be kind of fun.
[105:48.55]That's like what Channel Points is, but without me giving it to you.
[105:56.02]The time is frozen, right?
[105:56.94]Yeah.
[105:57.46]The Ash Twin project will be one of our biggest undertakings.
[105:59.58]Yeah.
[106:00.88]We need to travel quickly between Ash Twin and each location that holds crucial project materials.
[106:05.92]This is the sixth location.
[106:07.94]What if we used warp towers like the one we have on the White Hole Station to connect each planet directly to Ash Twin?
[106:15.81]Folk, Root, and I can begin work on this immediately in the Black Hole Forge.
[106:21.23]Where is it?
[106:22.83]Each tower on Ash Twin will warp to a different planet.
[106:27.94]Each tower on Ash Twin will warp to a different planet.
[106:31.42]We can design each tower to visually reflect its warp destination.
[106:39.22]Okay.
[106:40.56]The Giant's Deep Tower, for instance, could resemble a cyclone, and we could add trees to the Timber Hearth Tower.
[106:50.83]Yeah, so it's like a sham.
[106:53.26]They're towers.
[106:53.86]They're not even... They're not planets.
[106:56.06]They're towers.
[106:57.44]You don't get... You don't travel.
[107:00.68]To the fucking... You know what I mean?
[107:05.23]They added trees in it to make you think that... Wait, did I do this one yet?
[107:11.61]Hold on.
[107:15.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:21.78]Are there six here?
[107:23.90]One, two, three, four, five.
[107:25.18]No.
[107:25.24]Alright, I just opened it.
[107:36.89]This better be open from now on.
[107:41.33]This door will need to remain closed for some time.
[107:43.45]The high energy lab is now being used to design the Twaour project.
[107:51.72]Yeah, you used the sound of the city.
[107:54.04]We got it.
[107:56.96]Yeah, we got it.
[108:01.80]Now what am I supposed to do in here?
[108:04.39]Wait, where is this on the map so I can actually remember where the hell this is?
[108:10.57]It's okay.
[108:11.19]It's where the big tower is.
[108:12.97]The big, um... Like, paper mache tower.
[108:18.57]Right above the equator on the northern side.
[108:28.98]Okay, let's go down here.
[108:30.10]So, uh, what do we got?
[108:35.15]What can I do?
[108:36.39]Turn this on.
[108:48.84]Okay.
[109:03.41]Black hole, white hole.
[109:05.07]Black hole, white hole.
[109:14.83]Oh.
[109:16.13]Black hole, white hole.
[109:16.85]Okay, close it up.
[109:24.04]Wait, what's that?
[109:38.58]What are we looking at?
[109:41.69]No.
[109:41.85]Okay, that's... What?
[109:45.97]Alright, that was weird.
[109:48.61]What about two black holes?
[109:58.07]What about white hole, black hole?
[110:02.64]What does it do?
[110:11.33]Okay, so what about black hole and nothing?
[110:17.81]I don't know.
[110:26.33]Black hole, nothing.
[110:34.40]What else am I supposed to do?
[110:38.22]So if you go into a black hole, you come out of the white hole.
[110:42.39]Do two white holes do anything?
[110:47.69]Do I need to do anything about this?
[110:58.34]Yeah, okay, so you go in and you come out.
[111:05.91]Right?
[111:08.87]Okay.
[111:09.23]Is there anything else I'm supposed to do in here?
[111:26.57]Put it back in!
[111:27.19]Put it back in!
[111:27.65]Put it back in!
[111:28.01]Put it back in!
[111:40.08]You destroyed the fabric of space-time.
[111:56.74]This is a Joel credit sequence, right?
[112:12.64]Got the kazoo ending.
[112:22.19]No, I don't want the kazoo ending.
[112:23.95]I want the real one.
[112:25.66]The one that people talk about that's... I don't want the kazoo ending.
[112:41.53]No, I can load it, right?
[112:42.75]I can load the save and do it... What the fuck did that just say?
[112:53.94]Load previous save.
[112:54.60]Thank God.
[112:55.14]Did I learn all that info?
[113:20.21]What's the previous... I didn't learn anything?
[113:26.71]No, I did.
[113:27.53]Okay, I saved it.
[113:28.37]High Energy Lab, and then Ash Twin Tower Designs.
[113:34.91]Ash Twin Tower Designs.
[113:36.09]Thank God.
[113:41.66]Okay, so that's... Now that connects to here.
[113:45.24]Statue Island connects to here.
[113:48.66]High Energy Lab connects to here.
[113:50.32]Black Hole Forge, don't know where it is.
[113:54.19]We've almost... What is this?
[113:55.87]Probe tracking module.
[113:57.39]The fuck?
[113:58.15]Looks like the module's underwater.
[114:07.36]Oh.
[114:09.62]The thing that shoots out of that ship in the very beginning is the tracking module, which lands on Giant's Deep, which is what's in the center of Giant's Deep.
[114:24.30]Huh.
[114:25.42]Interesting.
[114:28.92]What else have I not done here?
[114:30.04]Southern Observatory.
[114:32.82]I signal locator on Brittle Hollow's south pole.
[114:36.94]There is a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory.
[114:40.65]The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator.
[114:44.25]Ryback says you can't get into the observatory from the surface.
[114:48.37]But there's probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere.
[114:50.97]There's a door to the observatory on the surface, but it's broken.
[114:54.15]Brittle Hollow.
[114:55.41]Path in the equator.
[115:00.47]Let's go, boys and girls.
[115:01.93]Let's go.
[115:02.47]I can't believe I got the kazoo ending.
[115:12.63]Turtle Hollow equator.
[115:25.17]Turtle Hollow into the equator.
[115:28.03]Let's go.
[115:29.61]Bye, please.
[115:44.68]Can we get hyped?
[115:46.01]I turned off hype trains.
[115:46.85]They don't exist anymore on this channel.
[116:02.94]Dude, are you ready to get scammed?
[116:04.80]I can't even turn it on.
[116:05.58]I think the broadcast has to be off before I can turn it on.
[116:14.41]Alright, we need to get to the equator.
[116:15.43]There's a path leading to this observatory.
[116:19.48]Going a little too fast.
[116:23.84]Alright, let's land.
[116:24.68]Get the fuck out there.
[116:37.32]I only don't it because I want to see hype trains.
[116:39.21]I want a refund.
[116:40.79]Look, we can just pretend that it's on right now.
[116:42.39]Okay, so there's a path on this equator.
[116:45.19]Okay, ready?
[116:45.67]Hype train stuff.
[117:03.55]I'm not seeing any hype.
[117:06.19]We're not even at level zero.
[117:07.39]Alright, well two people just got banned.
[117:21.11]So that's like two dollars.
[117:23.53]Alright, two people just got banned.
[117:25.65]So that's alright.
[117:26.95]Hype it up.
[117:32.59]Freeze detected.
[117:33.91]Is this it?
[117:38.48]No, this is the... No, this is it.
[117:41.16]This is it.
[117:44.65]The trees are moving.
[117:45.45]The trees are moving.
[117:46.25]The tree... Everything's moving.
[117:47.23]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[117:50.91]Need to go to the equator.
[117:53.09]Gotta go to the equator.
[117:54.09]Go to the equator.
[117:55.05]Equator, equator.
[117:56.11]When you find a path on the equator... Wait a minute.
[118:03.03]Can I get in from here?
[118:04.17]The door is broken, right?
[118:05.15]Is the door even down here?
[118:15.89]Alright, hold on.
[118:18.77]This goes... I remember this part confused me.
[118:24.07]This was very confusing to me.
[118:25.83]Okay, go up.
[118:30.53]Let's try it.
[118:30.93]Let's see what's up here.
[118:31.57]Dude, come on.
[118:34.51]What are you... Give me a break!
[118:37.41]Can I be going this fast?
[119:16.22]Be welcomed in this place.
[119:17.46]Above you stands the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
[119:20.52]If you are making your first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon, ascend these stairs and obtain the last of the knowledge you need for your journey.
[119:29.99]Really?
[119:30.27]The final clue?
[119:35.46]The final hint?
[119:44.06]No!
[119:46.42]Nooooooooo!
[120:22.65]That didn't do shit.
[120:26.37]I'm trying to Willy Wonka my way over there.
[120:29.49]Hold on.
[120:29.79]What does this say?
[120:32.81]Crossroads.
[120:33.71]Alright, turn it on.
[120:34.35]Look at this.
[120:41.75]Look at this Sonic the Hedgehog level 3 map.
[120:44.38]Give me a break.
[120:46.06]I'm not gonna- How am I gonna figure this out?
[120:51.93]I'm just, whatever.
[120:52.95]I'm just gonna go in.
[120:56.19]Bang a left, bang a right.
[120:57.19]We're going left.
[121:04.10]Now we're... Oh!
[121:06.86]Oh!
[121:08.08]Oh!
[121:08.56]What happened?
[121:09.56]What happened?
[121:10.06]Hello?
[121:11.20]Move.
[121:11.54]I just got hit in the head by a rock.
[121:19.10]Oh no.
[121:25.52]How did I get hit in the head?
[121:27.95]What the fuck is that?
[121:29.90]What is that?
[121:31.77]Grab it!
[122:05.55]What?
[122:07.57]I'm so confused.
[122:08.53]What is that?
[122:10.43]Why is this- what's this floating here for?
[122:36.59]Oh no, this is... Okay, this is the thing.
[122:39.81]This is the thing.
[122:40.65]Yeah.
[122:42.77]This is this place.
[122:46.63]But... Oh, shit.
[122:58.91]Yeah.
[123:01.49]Yeah.
[123:04.45]Turn it on.
[123:09.52]How do I turn this thing on?
[123:13.46]Dude, stop doing quantum crack.
[123:16.28]How do I turn this on?
[123:19.92]You, like, press A and it... You put... Where is it?
[123:22.95]It's something I have to do.
[123:23.81]Yep, yep.
[123:31.87]You stand on the warp platform on the floor and wait until the tower aligns with its corresponding astral body, Brittle Hollow.
[123:45.38]Look up while the station's rotating.
[123:46.52]You can see the alignment happens when the astropod is directly overhead.
[123:48.54]Yeah, didn't I... Oh, right.
[124:03.69]I forgot I had to do this.
[124:05.87]Like, turn the damn thing on.
[124:19.36]Let's go.
[124:27.27]Alright, where's my ship?
[124:34.34]Quantum crack.
[124:36.32]Quantum crack.
[124:53.70]crack that may or may not exist.
[124:56.22]Ooh, I felt that one.
[124:59.66]Okay.
[125:05.16]Let's go.
[125:07.89]Try this shit again.
[125:08.67]Um, don't do that, please, game.
[125:20.31]Alright.
[125:21.33]Where's that special place to go down?
[125:25.84]Sun's gonna explode.
[125:26.58]Yeah, I know what it is.
[125:27.36]I learned some more stuff though, didn't I?
[125:37.31]This way.
[125:40.91]Can I... That's too dangerous.
[126:10.28]What is this?
[126:11.36]Have I been over this way before?
[126:12.58]Yep.
[126:17.23]This is that rock.
[126:19.59]The disappearing rock.
[126:23.55]I feel like I don't want to go do all this because I'm going to run out of time.
[126:27.99]I'm just going to run out of time.
[126:36.64]It has to be so dark.
[126:39.32]Whatever.
[126:39.66]Let's go.
[126:51.31]Pick something and stick with it.
[126:52.31]I already... I did!
[126:55.59]I picked it!
[126:56.62]I'm trying to figure out how to get to this place in Brittle Hollow.
[126:59.60]Alright, give me this thing.
[127:06.65]Check this out.
[127:22.59]It doesn't want to move now?
[127:27.40]This thing's not quantum?
[127:28.54]I thought it was.
[127:42.84]I can't take a photo of it because I'm observing it when it's on the photo.
[127:46.81]Oh, whatever.
[128:05.89]Alright.
[128:07.23]This is where I was last time.
[128:09.93]I don't know.
[128:10.23]Where the hell am I even trying to get to?
[128:11.81]Down there?
[128:17.46]Alright.
[128:17.64]No falling rock, right?
[128:19.66]Not this time.
[128:20.28]Good.
[128:21.36]Alright.
[128:21.60]No gigantic falling crater.
[128:24.20]Good.
[128:24.52]I have a minute.
[128:25.14]Where am I going?
[128:27.22]Down there and then... To the left?
[128:45.14]Back where... Power... No, I just wrapped around.
[128:49.06]Did I?
[128:50.52]Kind of.
[128:52.42]Yeah.
[128:52.74]No, I'm above.
[128:53.36]It's the black hole.
[128:57.61]There he is.
[129:00.13]Alright, switch this up a little bit.
[129:05.61]Where am I trying to get to?
[129:24.69]To the left?
[129:26.09]Right?
[129:32.33]Now what?
[129:34.07]What is this even for?
[129:38.96]I have to be... Alright.
[129:46.30]Hey!
[129:46.88]Whoa, it's falling all the way in.
[129:51.87]Do I go with it?
[129:52.37]Alright, well, then his higher side is gone now.
[130:05.67]Uh... Do I have to be flying with that thing when... What about down there?
[130:17.22]What is that?
[130:17.76]Uh...
[130:23.22]this shit's upside down I don't know I really don't know can I flip this thing somehow and turn it upside down
[131:08.94]I gotta turn this whole thing upside down.
[131:10.46]How do I turn this upside down?
[131:14.08]Alright, I'm gonna turn this upside down.
[131:25.93]Um... Does this exist over here, too?
[131:36.22]Let me observe.
[131:38.14]Alright, hold on a second.
[131:39.20]Hold on a second.
[131:41.11]That thing's moving.
[131:41.95]No, I'm moving.
[131:42.91]No, it's me that's moving.
[131:43.97]It's me that's moving.
[132:02.96]What?
[132:03.72]Hold on.
[132:04.40]This whole thing came apart.
[132:06.44]Can I stand on this?
[132:13.46]Okay, wait.
[132:14.33]Now... Wait, what's this doing here?
[132:20.79]What is this thing doing here?
[132:26.68]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[132:28.56]Turn off the light, turn the lights off, turn the lights off, turn the lights off!
[132:34.64]Wait, what does it say?
[132:45.49]Beneath your feet lies the tower of knowledge?
[132:49.04]Can I go into this?
[132:52.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[132:57.72]Is this... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[133:04.51]Slow down.
[133:14.48]Um, okay, this is... Wait a minute, that's the tower right there.
[133:18.97]This is the Tower of Knowledge.
[133:21.41]Wasn't I already up there?
[133:25.47]Wait, this is the Tower of Knowledge.
[133:28.09]This is the tower.
[133:30.63]Hold on, can I go and... How much fuel do I have?
[133:37.79]Holy shit, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[133:39.13]Get up there.
[133:43.92]This is the actual tower.
[133:46.98]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[133:54.41]No, I'm so bad at controlling flying around.
[133:56.77]How high do I have to go?
[134:06.59]All the way?
[134:07.61]What's that over there?
[134:08.37]No, no, no, no.
[134:09.19]Go all the way to the top.
[134:20.63]pre-detected okay the fucking sun's gonna blow up let's just do quick read something read
[134:40.34]Welcome.
[134:40.84]So your arrival here means you've completed your preparation to die this evening.
[134:43.26]You're ready to depart for Quantum Moon.
[134:45.26]On your pilgrimage, the Quantum Moon will carry you, just as it carried me and many of my clan before me, to the moon's sixth and most secret location.
[134:50.36]And where is it?
[134:51.98]You'll be aided in your pilgrimage by the shrine our clan built in the Quantum Moon.
[134:55.77]But remember, this is the final route to explore the sixth location.
[134:57.67]The shrine must be on the moon's north pole.
[135:00.33]Be curious on your journey.
[135:02.97]What about this one?
[135:13.53]What do I do with this?
[135:16.09]The North Pole?
[135:16.73]It has to be on the North Pole.
[135:17.83]I already read this.
[135:25.44]Was there another one?
[135:37.03]Okay.
[135:38.91]So... Wait, what's this one?
[135:46.00]Wait, I didn't read one piece of text.
[135:49.52]Just one piece of text.
[135:58.94]One piece of text.
[136:03.71]What's this say?
[136:09.59]If you're here, that means that you made it.
[136:12.69]Bye.
[136:12.93]Too close.
[136:18.82]Oh, shit.
[136:20.48]Alright.
[136:20.90]The sixth location is... You found the secret of the sixth location.
[136:28.28]The North Pole of the Quantum Moon.
[136:42.03]It helps if you use at least 2% of your brain.
[136:49.29]This is a game about not knowing a single fucking thing about anything.
[136:55.21]Just use your brain.
[136:56.27]It's a mystery where you wake up every 20 minutes.
[137:06.11]We've already determined there's like 1,200 different locations.
[137:18.78]If that guy had dunce cap.
[137:27.60]I really want... How do I get Twitch to, like, make a dunce cap?
[137:32.24]And that's not a bad thing.
[137:33.12]That's a good thing.
[137:34.16]That's, like, a term of... Like, that's for us... We like that here.
[137:42.38]Power of quantum knowledge.
[137:43.78]Sixth location.
[137:47.32]Okay.
[137:47.86]The quantum moon sometimes disappears, possibly to an unknown sixth location.
[137:52.97]Many Nomai went on a pilgrimage during which the quantum moon carried them to its sixth and most secret location to explore the sixth location.
[138:00.09]The shrine on the moon must be on the moon's north pole.
[138:06.92]Let's go.
[138:07.30]Let's get to the moon.
[138:22.71]Hey, it had a job interview, and it got the job.
[138:24.59]Nice.
[138:26.09]Good work.
[138:28.23]Hell yeah.
[138:34.07]You do that job as best as you can.
[138:36.60]Make that fucking money.
[138:42.40]Alright, quantum flood.
[138:43.12]Where's the quantum?
[138:43.88]Quantum...
[138:53.50]Oh, it disappeared.
[138:58.68]Make those bits.
[139:00.14]Make those bits.
[139:04.23]Where's the singing moon?
[139:05.15]Come on.
[139:09.31]So, am I about to get to the... Here's the secret of the game.
[139:13.99]Oh, that'd be interesting.
[139:17.02]It is right there.
[139:18.04]It's literally right there, dude.
[139:19.16]Come on.
[139:24.65]Come on, it says I'm going to the secret location.
[139:37.69]I'm going very fast, but it's very far away.
[139:58.31]So we just gotta get this thing on the moon.
[140:00.69]On the North Pole.
[140:02.05]So I have to make it disappear and reappear until it's on the North Pole.
[140:06.05]And then open up the fucking elevator.
[140:31.55]He doesn't understand velocity.
[140:32.91]No, I just want to get there.
[140:34.59]I just want to go to this location as fast as possible.
[140:47.26]Okay, moon.
[140:54.40]I'm ready.
[141:05.43]Quantum moon secret.
[141:22.73]So,
[141:53.68]I've got to take a damn photo.
[142:07.27]Autopilot?
[142:07.79]I can't autopilot to a thing that doesn't exist.
[142:15.54]Okay, here we are.
[142:18.58]I killed that guy again.
[142:25.30]Killing this guy.
[142:28.86]Alright, North Pole.
[142:43.69]Let's get it on the North Pole.
[142:52.59]I'm floating.
[142:53.27]I'm floating so much.
[143:00.44]Alright, is it on the North Pole?
[143:02.38]Where is this thing?
[143:03.36]It's okay, it's on the South Pole.
[143:04.52]North Pole.
[143:09.58]There it is.
[143:10.90]Okay.
[143:11.86]It is now on the North... Is that the North Pole?
[143:17.30]Watch this shit.
[143:25.69]Okay.
[143:35.64]Close that fucking door.
[144:07.75]North Pole.
[144:14.23]Got it.
[144:15.55]Okay.
[144:16.11]Now I'm going to take a picture of this.
[144:28.05]Oops.
[144:28.33]Alright.
[144:29.73]Close it.
[144:31.19]Okay.
[144:31.43]Here we go.
[144:33.71]Sixth location.
[144:39.45]What's going on?
[144:52.85]Secret sixth location.
[144:55.39]Here it is.
[144:58.25]Oh fuck, it's gone.
[145:12.84]Wait.
[145:33.54]What's even here?
[145:42.81]That looks like a... That's a suction cup.
[145:46.63]There's a suction cup over here.
[145:48.09]There's a person.
[146:00.12]Why am I getting Castle Griffinsteed vibes right now?
[146:13.42]Okay.
[146:14.18]Hello.
[146:15.46]Solonum.
[146:18.98]Who are you?
[146:19.44]What are you doing?
[146:31.37]I can't do that.
[146:32.19]I don't know what that means.
[146:34.19]Pick up Identity Stone.
[146:35.59]Pick up You Stone.
[146:41.39]Pick up Eye of the Universe stone.
[146:43.88]Pick up Quantum Moon stone.
[146:45.62]Pick up Me stone.
[146:47.00]Pick up Explain stone.
[146:51.88]How many powers do I get?
[146:54.14]Alright, I want, uh... Explain stone.
[147:08.60]Insert Explain stone.
[147:15.15]Oh, explain, uh, explain me!
[147:18.82]I imagine your purpose here is the same as mine, to learn about and to find the Eye of the Universe.
[147:37.77]I'm unsure how you arrived here, however, perhaps you came from another star system, as my clan originally did?
[147:46.07]That wasn't a very good explanation.
[147:52.06]Do I have like three wishes or something?
[147:53.80]How long do I have to do this for?
[147:56.55]Explain the Eye of the Universe, please.
[148:07.01]Yeah, I've seen them.
[148:36.82]Conscious observation forces a quantum object to collapse to a single possibility.
[148:42.19]But what would happen if a conscious observer somehow entered the eye itself?
[148:48.75]Over time, this has become my clan's greatest question.
[148:54.78]Alright.
[148:55.60]More stuff.
[148:56.02]Explain... Explain you.
[148:57.74]I need to explain you.
[149:12.23]I am on my first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon.
[149:14.57]All know my and my clan make this journey when we come of age.
[149:20.73]Even though the Eye cannot be reached from here, the Quantum Moon remains special to us as it carries us nearer to the Eye than any other place we know.
[149:30.58]I've journeyed here to be close to the Eye.
[149:32.76]While the Eye is obscured from our sight, we can see the Quantum Moon's reflection of the Eye in the sky above us.
[149:45.34]Alright.
[149:50.32]And explain... Explain the quantum moon, too.
[149:53.16]Let's get all the info we can.
[150:00.17]He keeps taking a selfie of us.
[150:03.87]Alright.
[150:04.47]Have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet?
[150:08.89]The shard looks the same as the quantum moon's surface does now, while at the eye.
[150:15.01]From this we can reasonably infer the Quantum Moon's natural status as we see it now, and that the Eye is its primary location.
[150:22.88]Given the Quantum Moon is the Eye's Moon, it's likely that any characteristics the Moon exhibits are also exhibited by the Eye itself.
[150:30.66]The Quantum Moon and its shards, for instance, are Quantum, thus the Eye is likely also Quantum.
[150:36.25]Quantum Eyes, Quantum Moon's Eyes, the Eye of the Quantum Moon, Quantum Existence.
[150:41.79]In fact, this moon is probably quantum because its proximity to the eye made it quantum.
[150:45.51]The same way the areas surrounding quantum shards that landed on other planets eventually became quantum.
[150:50.77]So many quantum.
[150:59.07]So the eye is making this quantum.
[151:00.59]Okay.
[151:01.43]Quantum within a quantum.
[151:02.57]Got it.
[151:07.68]Shards that landed on other planets eventually became quantum too.
[151:13.49]Okay, identify.
[151:16.17]We have explained everything.
[151:17.31]So now let's identify me.
[151:22.77]Who the hell am I?
[151:30.48]I've never met one of your kind before.
[151:32.16]It's an honor to speak with you.
[151:33.30]I particularly admire your four eyes.
[151:35.56]Okay.
[151:38.03]There are many questions I would ask if I could comprehend your language.
[151:40.79]You have my gratitude for understanding mine.
[151:45.19]Chip log update.
[151:46.51]I have four eyes.
[151:47.55]Good to know.
[151:50.41]Uh, the quantum moon.
[152:00.72]This is the quantum moon where we both are standing.
[152:04.34]Despite also orbiting other celestial bodies, the quantum moon is the eye of the universe's moon.
[152:12.70]Ay-yi-yi-yi.
[152:16.82]Alright, identify you.
[152:19.92]Like, what's your name?
[152:21.14]Oh, you already told me.
[152:26.48]I am Solinum, a Nomai.
[152:27.84]My clan arrived in this star system before my birth.
[152:30.68]And we now call it home.
[152:38.35]Alright.
[152:39.57]What about identify the Eye of the Universe?
[152:41.87]He's going to be like, I don't know what that is.
[152:43.29]Because that's what I'm looking for.
[152:53.24]We are orbiting the eye of the universe now, although we cannot see it.
[152:57.48]Only the quantum moon's reflection of it.
[153:00.02]The eye is older than the universe itself, and my clan believes it dwells in an extremely distant orbit around this star system.
[153:16.93]Wait, I can...
[153:29.52]What?
[153:30.02]You and Eye of Universe.
[153:37.59]Many of my clan have believed the Eye called to us for a particular purpose.
[153:41.15]I gotta keep track of these.
[153:45.85]When I was a child, I used to believe the Eye was maleficent.
[153:50.26]They have lured my clan to the star system only to vanish from them so completely.
[153:56.62]But I don't fear the eye anymore.
[153:58.02]In fact, it became my fondest hope to see the eye itself someday, but I fear this may be beyond my reach.
[154:03.82]You may think I'm strange, but I have a hypothesis that I may not be entirely alive.
[154:08.04]Perhaps my journey has reached its end.
[154:13.91]You and... Okay, we're doing yous now.
[154:18.03]You and Quantum Moon.
[154:25.19]Like many of my clan before me, I journeyed here to see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye.
[154:28.07]This is the closest any of us have come to seeing the eye itself.
[154:31.41]You and me?
[154:33.35]You may think I'm strange, but I have a hypothesis that we... Oh, yes.
[154:37.05]We already know that.
[154:39.63]You... Are you and me?
[154:41.24]Wanna go to dinner later?
[154:44.36]What do you think?
[154:47.76]You and me.
[154:55.23]We do not have much connection, you and I. Oh, okay.
[154:58.10]Well, that's alright.
[155:00.20]Still, this encounter feels special.
[155:01.74]I hope you won't mind if I think you as a friend.
[155:03.48]That's okay.
[155:06.54]Alright.
[155:07.36]Yep.
[155:09.62]Okay, fine.
[155:11.19]That's alright.
[155:13.17]Okay, you and moon.
[155:19.05]Quantum friend zone.
[155:22.78]Did I do them all?
[155:23.80]You and explain.
[155:25.30]No, I did them all.
[155:26.68]You and me.
[155:27.81]You and the eye.
[155:28.71]Did I do them all?
[155:33.83]This guy's probably so sick of writing this shit, he's like, alright man, like how many times do you remember to write the same thing?
[155:39.61]Okay, now let's do me.
[155:44.86]Okay, me and eye.
[155:57.67]Suppose you could reach the eye of the universe.
[155:59.83]Would you try to enter it?
[156:02.61]What do you imagine the effects of a conscious observer might be?
[156:05.20]I don't know.
[156:09.72]I just feel like, whoa.
[156:12.10]Quantum moon and me.
[156:15.96]Is this your first time on the quantum moon?
[156:17.62]It's my first time.
[156:19.78]If you've come here looking for answers, I hope you find them.
[156:23.79]Thanks.
[156:26.58]Okay, me and you, me and moon, me and identify.
[156:29.36]Okay, what else have we not done?
[156:30.68]Moon and I, right?
[156:33.45]Moon.
[156:38.83]Identify, explain.
[156:48.39]These are the two tenets of Nomai philosophy.
[156:50.78]To seek out and to understand is our way of living.
[156:59.68]alright now we gotta do uh moon and we're gonna have I done them all moon and I I've done them all I think yeah I've done them all oh alright now how do I tell this person like goodbye now what do we do
[157:30.45]Uh... Do I just walk by him?
[157:38.49]Alright.
[158:03.47]What else?
[158:03.91]Should I explore a little bit more?
[158:06.17]I think I should explore a little.
[158:26.04]Was that the guy?
[158:26.66]Wait, didn't I...
[158:40.87]You killed him.
[158:44.37]I took a photo of him.
[158:46.15]I took a photo of him and killed him.
[158:47.61]Alright, now this is here.
[158:49.75]But... I quantum murdered him.
[158:58.21]He wasn't supposed to be alive in this universe.
[159:02.19]It's her.
[159:02.81]Oh, I quantum killed her.
[159:04.21]Should I go?
[159:12.11]I think I gotta go back and process this in the ship.
[159:19.28]I need to process this info.
[159:22.90]We didn't learn anything.
[159:23.80]Yes, we did.
[159:24.30]We learned that the moon is the eye's moon.
[159:27.50]And it's an eye.
[159:29.01]Go in.
[159:32.73]Where's that ship?
[159:40.45]Come on.
[159:41.09]Where's the ship?
[159:41.59]Spawn the ship already.
[159:52.21]Alright, I've been here before.
[159:53.79]I'm watching these guys.
[159:55.51]I'm about to stand on the... Wait, this is... Maybe... Oh, this is your ship!
[159:59.80]This is your ship!
[160:03.33]I found your ship!
[160:15.36]I am ready.
[161:00.61]What?
[161:02.43]What is that?
[161:19.24]It sucked into the black hole.
[161:21.40]I... Um... What's over here?
[161:24.74]Hold on.
[161:25.78]There's something over... I don't think I've been over here.
[161:27.34]What is this?
[161:31.83]Uh... Big bits came in.
[161:34.03]Daddy Umbra!
[161:34.85]Another hundred dollars from Daddy Umbra.
[161:42.45]Thank you, Daddy Umbra, again.
[161:43.59]For your insane contributions.
[161:46.40]Your fucking hundreds of dollars...
[161:50.42]Wait, did I just quantum lock myself in?
[161:52.04]No.
[161:59.01]Wait, I have some shit here.
[162:03.69]They say, but seriously, I want to give back for all the years of entertainment and happiness you've given me and so many others.
[162:08.89]Keep being you.
[162:09.45]You're an amazing person.
[162:13.79]Thank you, Daddy Umber.
[162:18.63]Happy you think that way.
[162:24.60]Thanks, Daddy.
[162:28.39]I said, Daddy Umbra.
[162:31.47]Alright, sun's coming in.
[162:36.20]Let me, uh... No.
[162:39.92]I'll just fly to the sun.
[162:40.76]Who cares?
[162:42.88]The sun hungers.
[162:43.68]Yeah, I got a lot of info that I have to process.
[163:02.39]It's probably the sun.
[163:04.47]The eye of the universe is probably just the sun.
[163:12.64]Right?
[163:12.82]That's probably what it is.
[163:13.88]If I were to take a wild guess, I'd say this quantum moon is the sun's moon.
[163:35.53]Suns don't have moons.
[163:38.03]This is a video game, though.
[163:40.31]It could...
[163:55.95]Okay, so I've learned too much.
[163:57.51]I am now a threat to the cosmic balance of the world, right?
[164:04.48]How do I use this info?
[164:28.85]When are these times I'm not gonna wake up?
[164:30.15]Alright, ship time.
[164:41.90]Let's dump some knowledge.
[164:51.33]Alright, sixth location.
[164:53.73]Is that it?
[165:06.31]Quantum moon is the eye of the universe's moon.
[165:08.77]At this location, the quantum moon becomes a reflection of the eye.
[165:13.15]The eye is likely the source of all macroscopic quantum phenomena in the solar system.
[165:28.56]I still have a quantum signal on Giant's Deep.
[165:30.90]It's at the bottom of the ocean, though, and I can't get in there.
[165:35.00]The Ash Twin.
[165:35.70]The Nomai plan to construct technology capable of producing a 22-minute negative time interval on Ash Twin.
[165:40.44]I've got to get in here.
[165:45.24]This black hole forward, I don't know how to get in there either.
[165:59.15]On Ash Twin.
[166:07.63]Still, I don't know what that is.
[166:11.26]Ocean depths.
[166:18.34]What the hell was it?
[166:35.30]There's a huge Nomai city just north of Rybeck's campsite.
[166:38.82]Hmm.
[166:42.06]Sub-surface energy readings.
[166:43.57]The shuttle's equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.
[166:47.45]Two of the Nomai located a fissure in the ice on the interloper's sunward side.
[166:51.47]They descended inside to investigate.
[167:01.55]Fissure in the ice on the interloper's sunward side.
[167:05.53]Let's go.
[167:17.56]Sounds like a lead.
[167:25.77]Hey, look.
[167:28.19]It's coming over now.
[167:32.40]fissure in the ice on the sun side.
[167:49.63]That would be this side.
[167:51.71]Right?
[167:52.51]The side I'm currently going to.
[168:12.04]we gotta go down is that it right there is that it right in the middle right in the middle of the ice cream cone what
[168:46.16]I thought the sun was farther away than that.
[168:47.84]You and me both.
[168:50.06]We both thought that exact same thing.
[168:58.57]Classic sun joke.
[169:00.35]Ah, I love this streamer.
[169:07.53]I had autopilot on too as far as I didn't think I was going to be.
[169:16.77]Alright fucking bionic boomer adjustment That's complete what
[169:46.51]I'm sitting here adjusting my, like, back brace and shit.
[169:58.90]No, I didn't do that.
[169:59.92]Whatever.
[170:02.70]I... I didn't even have the fucking controller in my hand.
[170:11.53]You could even hear the straps moving with two hands.
[170:17.33]Fucking autopilot.
[170:19.39]God, I'm just gonna do it myself.
[171:03.11]Suicidal autopilot.
[171:18.08]Okay, let's coast.
[171:20.08]Bring it down to like 300.
[171:33.10]Don't plot a course through the sun.
[171:37.21]I have... Okay, if you use Google Maps to drive somewhere, it doesn't drive you in a straight line through buildings.
[171:45.45]Why would the GPS not be that sophisticated with space traveling?
[171:52.61]Alright, right there, right?
[171:53.51]That's the one, right in the middle.
[171:59.36]it's right there up in there alright let's get on it where is this because you're in the ice
[172:31.53]How we doing?
[172:42.70]It's a maze?
[172:43.84]It's not really a maze, but... It might need to melt.
[172:53.81]Okay.
[172:58.85]Here we go.
[172:59.25]It's gonna melt.
[173:07.01]The fuck was that?
[173:07.75]What was that?
[173:09.05]What was that?
[173:10.13]What is that?
[173:11.59]What was that?
[173:12.79]Was that a snot bubble coming out of my mouth?
[173:14.97]What was that?
[173:16.61]What are these things?
[173:25.56]Alright, melt.
[173:34.08]Here it comes.
[173:44.17]Oh, shit.
[173:44.87]Alright, easy.
[173:58.94]Ghost matter.
[174:04.14]Ghost matter there.
[174:07.98]I can't go down this tunnel.
[174:10.48]There's ghost shit in there.
[174:18.40]Oh, man.
[174:20.80]Ghost nearby.
[174:21.88]Where?
[174:34.92]I'm receiving much stronger energy readings now that we're beneath the crust.
[174:40.22]Whatever it is, it must lie somewhere below, closer to the comet's center.
[174:44.15]I'm starting to think it's more dangerous than we realized.
[174:47.48]I understand, but be cautious, both of you.
[174:49.79]Here comes a ghost maze.
[175:27.72]back up back up back up back up can I go just blow right through it nope I was sliding I couldn't go anywhere I couldn't even go back I was sliding forward
[176:03.82]well I could have just shot the probe but instead I don't know why I was panicking with the photo mode okay let's do that again
[176:38.98]you gotta be that far away now don't do autopilot I'm gonna drive right into the sun I'm thinking of which like why was I not I thought I was controlling it
[177:07.92]Safe.
[177:09.68]No, get up.
[177:26.88]First links.
[177:29.50]Gotta cut it off.
[177:39.82]You're already about to cross the sun here.
[177:41.14]Nah, I want to be on the other side though.
[177:56.78]Autopilot, what are you doing?
[178:04.35]It's traveling kind of too fast.
[178:06.17]I need to get in closer.
[178:09.83]Slow down.
[178:10.27]What the fuck is going on?
[178:11.03]Slow down.
[178:12.66]Slow the fuck down.
[178:15.24]Autopilot just fucking almost screwed me.
[178:16.60]What are you doing?
[178:42.86]Land it.
[178:52.75]Alright, get in.
[178:53.73]Get in the fissure.
[178:54.37]Let's do this again.
[178:55.97]Alright, cool.
[179:01.14]This time I'm going to try to not get killed by the ghost matter.
[179:24.07]Okay, let's go.
[179:51.60]So I'm just curious, what else is down here?
[180:00.52]Oh, launch mode.
[180:10.75]Interesting.
[180:12.93]That just dumps you out there.
[180:13.89]That doesn't do anything.
[180:15.73]This one is bogus too.
[180:19.41]What about this one?
[180:19.95]Hmm.
[180:20.21]Okay.
[180:21.51]What about this one?
[180:33.84]Yeah.
[180:36.40]Okay.
[180:36.74]What about this one?
[180:54.65]Correct.
[180:58.26]That one is correct.
[181:00.02]Is that a curiosity?
[181:00.76]What about this one?
[181:01.34]Yeah.
[181:03.14]It's the one I already did.
[181:08.68]Okay.
[181:09.36]It's this one.
[181:09.76]This is the right one.
[181:12.58]Hey, what's going on?
[181:13.56]Alright, here we go.
[181:29.34]There's two ways to go.
[181:30.20]Okay, right.
[181:30.92]Right, we're good.
[181:31.36]Okay.
[181:46.25]Now, that's a... That's a big cave with...
[182:01.89]Um, it's still going.
[182:05.70]Wait, it's like hovering down there.
[182:07.70]Um... How do I get down here?
[182:45.81]Oh, up there?
[182:53.35]Oh, be careful!
[182:54.01]Alright, we got two.
[182:56.24]Where's this one going?
[183:03.60]Um...
[183:24.15]Ghost detected nearby?
[183:25.43]Where is this?
[183:26.17]Alright, it's the... Don't go down the left... Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?
[183:45.79]You're telling me that I have to do... I have to shoot and...
[183:51.43]Let me just do... Hold on.
[183:52.41]Wait, this might not be as... Which one was it?
[183:54.43]It was right?
[183:56.31]Right, then left?
[183:58.35]Then right?
[184:01.83]It's already moving!
[184:03.39]Right, then... Right, then left, then right!
[184:10.71]I can't slow down.
[184:13.45]Oh, yes, I can.
[184:13.83]I'm good.
[184:17.86]And left?
[184:21.26]It's left, it's left.
[184:22.42]Right?
[184:22.62]And then... Hold on.
[184:29.97]Is it left?
[184:30.53]I don't have a good view.
[185:03.00]Fuck.
[185:06.22]I go up.
[185:08.14]Oh my God, I don't know which way, which one of these.
[185:10.24]Not this one, not this one.
[185:11.46]Is it this one?
[185:14.02]Which one is it?
[185:18.80]And then right.
[185:28.27]Then left.
[185:28.81]This is backwards.
[185:36.38]I don't know where the fuck this is even going.
[185:40.13]Up there?
[185:40.59]Did I make it?
[185:43.43]Oh.
[186:09.67]There's a dead person down here.
[186:21.65]Holy shit.
[186:24.35]Wait, I need my thing.
[186:30.44]I need to take photos.
[186:33.36]Can I read this?
[186:42.24]The spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the energy readings.
[186:48.58]No, rather the source of what's within the stone.
[186:50.36]I'm detecting some form of exotic matter.
[186:53.60]There's a lot to read for floating around.
[186:55.44]The stone is muting our energy readings.
[186:58.72]They should be ten times what we're seeing at least.
[187:04.02]I don't think we want this matter interacting with us.
[187:07.44]As far as I can tell, direct contact with it would almost be fatal.
[187:10.14]Don't touch it.
[187:12.30]Look at this density scan.
[187:12.92]I've never seen anything this tightly compacted before.
[187:31.83]This is orders of magnitude worse than I'd imagined.
[187:35.61]If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing the star system almost instantaneously.
[187:44.10]And the pressure is still building as the comet approaches this star system.
[187:51.59]Return to the shuttle right now.
[187:53.03]The rest of our friends need to know they're in terrible danger.
[187:55.53]Leave your equipment and run.
[187:59.38]What are you doing, Pi?
[188:01.23]The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival.
[188:04.27]I will learn what I can here.
[188:05.55]Go warn the others.
[188:06.39]Maybe they can construct shelter somehow.
[188:08.10]Now, go!
[188:16.07]Don't touch it?
[188:30.20]Alright, that's death.
[188:42.82]So... I've made it.
[188:45.20]There's nothing else down here.
[188:50.08]Touch it.
[188:50.62]If I touch it... I'm gonna touch it.
[188:57.15]What's going on?
[189:00.54]What's happening?
[189:03.58]This doesn't do anything.
[189:07.96]Okay.
[189:31.29]inside of this I can't I'm I'm dead this was causing the ghosts what the fuck is this
[190:00.42]That's where I came from.
[190:01.10]Okay.
[190:07.28]Well, let's put it in the computer.
[190:15.25]So that's the... That's the source of the ghost matter, I'm assuming?
[190:18.63]It's green.
[190:37.24]Is that what's causing the explosion?
[190:38.57]Is that... I don't know.
[190:44.50]Put it in the computer.
[190:47.54]Ruptured core.
[190:50.73]So this is the explosion.
[191:18.53]This is what's blowing up.
[191:19.85]But the sun blows up.
[191:20.93]That's not what happens.
[191:21.61]Okay.
[191:26.53]Yeah, we... Well, this is completed, kind of.
[191:35.63]It already blew up.
[191:36.47]Yeah.
[191:37.14]So... Alright.
[191:42.00]Still have to do this.
[191:50.24]Still need to do this.
[191:50.96]22 minute, uh, correspondence started with an ash twin.
[192:04.05]Finished reading what?
[192:04.81]Found this?
[192:11.85]You have three nomai aboard the shuttle.
[192:16.31]One of them stayed behind to keep the shuttle warm while the other two explored the interloper.
[192:22.65]Sorry, the Nomai who stayed behind lost contact with the other two after they descended below the interloper's surface.
[192:30.13]Okay.
[192:30.45]I pulled their ship.
[192:38.15]Nomai landed on the interloper not long after its arrival in the solar system.
[192:41.21]Okay.
[192:47.57]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna head back to Ash Twin.
[192:50.82]And see if I can figure out how to do any of this shit at Ash Twin.
[192:55.08]Give it a go.
[193:17.38]Okay, now the question is what do I do?
[193:28.67]That's the ultimate question of the game Ash twin is the sand one
[193:45.42]I have to figure out that sun station right there.
[193:49.49]I gotta get on that.
[193:50.67]I have to get on the sun station too.
[193:53.57]Somehow, I don't know how, but I do.
[194:10.62]So, I need to find this thing on Ash Twin.
[194:13.54]This USB storage tower thing.
[194:16.41]Remember?
[194:25.84]How do I get in there?
[194:53.67]You just go.
[194:55.35]I know, right?
[194:57.23]I had it in me all along.
[194:58.25]I just had to go.
[195:08.34]Why are you guys doing rhythm heaven?
[195:13.84]Alright.
[195:22.20]Alright.
[195:23.94]See if I can find something to do here.
[195:26.26]Land.
[195:57.57]Okay.
[196:00.06]Find something to do here.
[196:01.58]There's a tower.
[196:02.60]There's a place to go.
[196:03.70]I don't really have much info besides... One of the poles, maybe?
[196:23.29]There's this big tower here.
[196:32.67]Now, I wonder, the more the sand drops, is there going to be something else under here?
[196:36.74]I don't think I've waited.
[196:39.64]Let's see.
[196:47.54]Still dropping.
[196:48.10]Yeah, I'm just going to wait.
[197:05.25]This is going to reveal some giant satellite.
[197:26.38]I didn't do it again, did I?
[197:32.03]Where did it even go?
[197:34.71]Why does that have to keep happening?
[197:36.87]I don't get it.
[197:39.39]Don't you have suction cups on the bottom of your fucking ship by now?
[197:42.51]Okay, so this is that, but who cares?
[197:49.29]Okay, here we go.
[197:51.15]I've never waited this long.
[197:56.63]What else is on?
[197:57.45]Is it keep going?
[198:04.50]Is there more?
[198:13.37]Is that it?
[198:15.09]No, it's still going.
[198:16.63]It is still going.
[198:25.41]Jeez, how big is this thing?
[198:31.33]There's probably something I can get in the middle or something.
[198:40.03]Let's see.
[198:41.05]I'm going to wait this out.
[198:46.38]Hold on.
[198:46.58]Let me just let Otto up.
[198:47.78]Be right back.
[199:22.31]Alright.
[199:22.83]Yeah, he wanted to leave the room.
[199:26.61]So, how much further... I have a question.
[199:32.26]Does the planet run out of sand to a point where it's just a core and there's nothing here?
[199:39.30]I've never waited that long.
[199:46.79]This just dumps all sand over here and then this becomes empty.
[200:05.29]Oh, this is a giant 22-minute hourglass.
[200:22.24]Oh.
[200:24.46]It takes 22 minutes, and it's just a timer.
[200:32.89]But...
[200:37.59]they called it the hourglass twins before yeah but I I didn't realize that it was dumping all the sand and it was a 22 minute the 20 you die in 22 minutes why is it 22 minutes I knew that it was like oh the sand goes from here to there but but what's the point of why is this why is this 22 minutes of sand
[201:03.60]I'm gonna die out here.
[201:04.52]Where's my ship?
[201:06.04]Oh, right.
[201:06.60]It's fucking gone.
[201:17.80]This thing is huge.
[201:31.45]I wonder if this is just an entrance.
[201:32.69]Is it just an entrance?
[201:33.71]What else has been revealed?
[201:47.16]I mean, this shit is getting bigger.
[201:58.89]Uh, I've already seen this.
[202:00.28]I can't really see now.
[202:06.16]I've already been up there and over here.
[202:07.64]There's one on both sides.
[202:16.86]There's one on a north and a south pole.
[202:19.06]They're just huge antennas.
[202:25.59]Is there oxygen in here?
[202:30.61]Can I walk in it or anything?
[202:41.08]Is there oxygen in here?
[202:42.12]Somewhere.
[202:43.84]Hmm.
[203:08.90]I want to see what's at the very bottom.
[203:20.90]The ship is right over there.
[203:21.99]It's not.
[203:25.73]It's over there.
[203:40.90]What else before I die?
[203:44.56]I'm becoming, like, rocky.
[203:46.78]Oh, fuck.
[203:47.48]Wait a minute.
[203:47.88]What's this?
[203:48.70]What is that?
[203:49.18]What's this?
[203:49.60]What's this?
[203:49.98]What's this?
[203:51.12]Oh, I thought that was part of the, uh... Never mind.
[203:56.64]Is there oxygen in here?
[204:01.82]Oxygen?
[204:03.72]Oxygen?
[204:11.83]wake up so
[204:59.79]Alright, every memory recorded by I know my statue is transferred to a corresponding storage unit within Ashtwyn.
[205:04.45]Okay.
[205:05.35]Ashtwyn, you can't do anything on it until like 15 minutes have gone by to go in the towers that hold those masks?
[205:21.66]I could do this.
[205:23.70]Still haven't figured this out either.
[205:24.74]I'm gonna do the Hanging City.
[205:29.45]Or I'm going to try to go to the bottom of the ocean.
[205:36.02]I have this as well.
[205:38.52]I was trying to get here, but I got to the fucking quantum moon thing.
[205:45.21]Ocean depths.
[205:51.35]No mind on the construction.
[205:52.31]I saw something sink beneath the underwater current, which they previously thought was impossible.
[205:56.11]Well, what sunk there?
[205:58.94]Should I just dive in going 5,000 miles per hour?
[206:15.44]I'm just going to drive straight into the planet as fast as I can and go into the water?
[206:24.28]Or should I try to drop something in there?
[206:27.50]I wonder if I should drop something.
[206:30.04]Dump something in there.
[206:32.16]Throw something in there.
[206:33.00]I don't know.
[206:43.61]Tornado?
[206:52.28]The tornado throws everything in the air, but I don't know if it'll throw the center in the air.
[207:12.76]I wonder if I can tell.
[207:13.70]I remember seeing inside of that room from one of those disk things.
[207:41.51]I don't think I can go in there with the ship and dive that far.
[207:44.83]I don't think it's gonna work.
[207:50.10]I'm just gonna end up dying and have to redo flying across the galaxy again.
[207:53.90]Okay.
[208:02.53]What else is even here that I've seen?
[208:11.09]Alright.
[208:31.22]I have a question.
[208:32.02]I have a question.
[208:37.02]Can I fly into the Super Tornado?
[208:48.99]Okay.
[208:49.71]What if I fly straight down into the super tornado?
[209:05.46]Where is it?
[209:14.36]I just do it?
[209:14.80]I just did it!
[209:17.04]I just did it!
[209:18.60]I just did it.
[209:21.86]I'm in the fucking middle of the tornado.
[209:28.56]I did it.
[209:41.19]I can't believe that worked.
[209:46.76]I actually cannot believe that that just worked.
[210:02.35]Found it.
[210:19.18]Is this like an elevator?
[210:23.08]Okay.
[210:34.36]I can't fly up there.
[210:35.28]I don't know.
[210:49.00]The shard is inside of that, though.
[210:53.34]This has got to be something I can... There we go.
[210:58.08]Walk it.
[210:58.86]Just walk it.
[210:59.38]Don't even... Who cares about an elevator?
[211:00.88]Let's go.
[211:15.69]Now, this is the last shard, right?
[211:25.44]I feel like I'm coming here a little late.
[211:33.80]This would be my probably 30th quantum journey so far.
[211:36.78]Well, let's go up.
[212:16.33]Enter this place without friends.
[212:17.72]However, these are lessons to learn for yourself.
[212:28.42]Okay.
[212:33.42]Keep going up.
[212:35.20]Can I keep going up?
[212:37.10]I'm going in the middle.
[212:50.90]Is it gonna kill me?
[212:59.65]Seek the Wandering Arch.
[213:07.97]I know this shit.
[213:16.32]Alright, before we get into this, I gotta pee.
[213:19.65]I gotta pee real bad.
[213:22.07]We'll take our actual first real break of the night.
[213:24.06]I'll be right back.
[213:25.14]Pee time.
[216:04.92]Alright.
[216:06.52]I feel refreshed.
[216:12.00]Ow.
[216:12.18]There we go.
[216:24.75]Alright, follow the wandering arch.
[216:29.88]It's a quantum arch.
[216:31.46]Guaranteed.
[216:35.17]There it is.
[216:36.73]Alright, so I gotta take a photo of it.
[216:43.35]Ooh, you can't see.
[216:44.55]Sorry.
[216:53.99]All the wandering arch.
[216:57.25]So I should just take a picture of it, right?
[216:58.51]Okay.
[217:14.45]Go in?
[217:14.81]My mic is not muted.
[217:18.77]I'm right here.
[217:19.31]I'm just gonna go in.
[217:30.00]Uh, unidentified signal.
[217:32.06]Well, I found you.
[217:42.04]Where are you going from here?
[217:56.33]there it is alright so what does this do for me in the grand scheme of things it just completes the story or something
[218:21.13]I guess.
[218:22.41]What's this?
[218:24.35]Observing a quantum object, observe an image of a quantum object.
[218:27.55]These are the same.
[218:31.01]Observing a quantum object, observing an image of a quantum object.
[218:33.91]Yes.
[218:35.21]This is teaching us the thing that I accidentally figured out.
[218:38.78]Because of the moon.
[218:41.40]This is where you're supposed to learn this.
[218:45.22]That's fucking funny.
[218:49.76]There it is!
[218:52.85]I figured it out.
[218:53.65]I did it.
[218:56.03]Good thing I learned how to do this.
[219:02.19]Now what is that?
[219:21.05]Oh, I can walk on this wall.
[219:22.21]Hold on.
[219:25.45]I gotta take a photo of it.
[219:27.38]Right?
[219:30.64]Yeah.
[219:40.37]Read the tutorial stones?
[219:42.17]I mean, I... I kind of already know how this works.
[219:45.01]The arch and the crystal do not naturally meet.
[219:51.15]I'll just get it on there and then freeze it.
[219:52.83]Hey!
[220:00.53]Hey!
[220:30.73]Quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum.
[220:43.08]This is the last one, but we made it harder.
[220:44.94]Oh shit, what am I gonna do about this?
[220:57.42]I have to rock climb with this.
[220:58.78]Okay.
[221:11.84]I didn't mean to do that.
[221:13.76]Did I just die?
[221:25.75]Build the quantum helicopter.
[221:28.44]Hold on.
[221:28.84]Wait.
[221:42.37]Sun's coming.
[221:45.89]Wait, what is going on?
[221:46.61]Why are these not moving now?
[221:56.79]I don't want this one to move.
[221:58.04]Now I want this one to move, right?
[222:02.38]All the cameras watching them both.
[222:03.60]There we go.
[222:04.16]Okay, now you stay there.
[222:05.14]Okay.
[222:08.86]Okay.
[222:15.27]Now you stay here.
[222:16.13]Okay.
[222:18.83]Come on, bring it up.
[222:22.40]No, bring it up this way.
[222:23.34]There you go.
[222:25.98]Okay, now you stay here.
[222:31.34]And that's it.
[222:43.46]Congratulations.
[222:44.74]You've been given the power... ...of the tutorial.
[222:52.16]We offer our congratulations.
[222:53.50]You've learned the rule of quantum imaging.
[222:56.96]Take this knowledge with you on the remainder of your quantum pilgrimage.
[223:01.05]Remember, the other quantum shards have other lessons to teach.
[223:06.05]Oh.
[223:10.17]Oh, the shards are tutorials.
[223:19.00]right the shards are just tutorials that's the purpose our curiosity goes with all you on your journey you walk in the footsteps of those who come before you and your path guides you those who follow later sure thanks a lot at least we completed it and that's how we fall down
[223:47.30]Congrats on beating the tutorial.
[223:48.94]Thanks!
[223:50.76]Well, let me go put this in the ship, because... Now I gotta figure out how to go to the bottom of the ocean.
[224:05.59]Alright, get it in the computer.
[224:09.77]Done.
[224:12.40]All tutorials have been completed, actually.
[224:18.82]Alright, this is done.
[224:27.33]Pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon was a deeply significant journey for the Nomai.
[224:33.27]They built a shrine on the moon to aid in the pilgrimage to its sixth location.
[224:36.21]Remember this final rule?
[224:37.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[224:40.69]So he did all this.
[224:43.63]So what remains?
[224:46.69]These two... This one's pretty much done.
[224:52.59]This over here, but I don't need this, I don't think.
[224:54.99]Do I?
[224:55.43]Because the big ticket is right here.
[225:02.93]I could do the ocean depth thing, but I signal locator.
[225:14.38]Probe tracking.
[225:15.54]One of the Orbital Probe Cannon's three modules, the probe tracking module, is receiving data from the launched probe.
[225:21.91]Any Nomai onboard the probe tracking module will be the first to see the coordinates of the eye of the universe.
[225:29.05]A Nomai computer reports the probe tracking module is missing.
[225:32.09]I saw the probe tracking module through a Nomai projection pool.
[225:37.94]It looks like the module is underwater.
[225:40.56]I can see purple electricity outside.
[225:42.50]It's down here.
[225:44.68]How do I get down there?
[225:45.66]Alright, let's get up here.
[226:16.80]I think... Where do I want to go?
[226:20.94]What the hell is that?
[226:26.75]What is this?
[226:29.25]What is that?
[226:34.92]Where's the observatory?
[226:35.84]Where's the observatory?
[226:43.99]Southern Observatory in the Ocean Current Discovery.
[226:50.15]Brittle Hollow's South Pole.
[226:53.51]It's a path beneath the surface that leads to... I tried to do this before.
[226:56.75]No, I did this, but then I got turned... We did the moon thing.
[227:00.35]We met that god.
[227:01.43]There was somebody there.
[227:04.31]Brittle Hollow.
[227:07.27]Brittle Hollow's Equator.
[227:08.17]I got distracted.
[227:11.01]Okay, Brittle Hollow's Equator.
[227:19.24]I feel like I'm getting close.
[227:22.40]I feel like I'm getting... Wait, what is... What is this?
[227:24.64]I need... What is this?
[227:27.64]What is that?
[227:45.75]What is this thing?
[227:52.10]Have I even gone over here yet?
[227:58.80]It's white.
[227:59.46]Oh, that's the white hole station.
[228:06.63]Alright, let's go.
[228:12.49]Uh, the sun's gonna blow up if I did all that.
[228:14.06]I might as well just die.
[228:30.73]Yeah, the sun's going.
[228:32.94]Yeah, I'm running into the sun.
[228:35.14]I have probably like five minutes.
[228:37.18]It's not enough time.
[228:51.59]I can't even drive into the sun correctly.
[229:06.98]Hourglass planet.
[229:08.00]Oh, shit.
[229:08.88]You are absolutely right.
[229:17.22]That's true.
[229:20.37]By this point, it's going to be like... Yeah, there'd be nothing there.
[229:24.65]Let's go.
[229:36.53]Nope.
[229:39.76]But we might... No, no, it's over.
[229:42.40]There's no way I'm going to get there fast enough.
[229:43.80]Just burn up in the sun.
[229:45.88]Who cares?
[229:48.16]It's kind of cool, though.
[229:50.78]Just die.
[229:56.50]I don't think being able to land and get out and do anything in 30 seconds is going to work.
[230:02.85]Looks cool.
[230:11.14]Alright, Brittle Hollow, Equator.
[230:52.26]You don't know the ship has a landing mode?
[230:57.12]I've used it like a hundred times.
[231:07.63]Alright, Brittle Hollow is behind me.
[231:20.46]Turn.
[231:24.08]Is it behind me?
[231:25.28]Yeah, what?
[231:32.12]Wait, where the hell is it?
[231:33.08]Is it behind the sun?
[231:37.58]Where is Brittle Hollow?
[231:44.33]I'm getting so turned around.
[231:47.37]It's right there.
[231:47.97]What is going on?
[231:52.15]Why can I not see it?
[231:52.87]I'm gonna go in the sun.
[231:57.54]I'm gonna go into the sun.
[231:59.50]No, no, no.
[232:00.44]I refuse.
[232:00.90]I fucking refuse.
[232:02.54]I refuse to go into the sun.
[232:03.84]I refuse to do it for like a tenth time.
[232:07.13]I refuse.
[232:07.51]I refuse to do it.
[232:09.75]No.
[232:17.66]Can't get the fuck out of here.
[232:26.27]Where?
[232:29.11]Why can I not see this thing?
[232:35.41]Am I losing my goddamn mind?
[232:37.91]What?
[232:43.47]Am I going backwards?
[232:45.31]Which direction am I facing?
[232:53.10]Where are the planets?
[232:54.36]Where are any planets?
[232:57.29]Where did I go?
[232:59.59]Oh my god, out here.
[233:01.05]I don't even know how I got this way.
[233:03.96]I went out into the skybox.
[233:22.15]I think I was so... Don't fly into the sun, please.
[233:26.72]Do not autopilot-stun me.
[233:28.36]God.
[233:46.98]Okay.
[233:48.82]Later.
[233:50.26]There's also a hanging city thing here, too.
[234:00.21]Which is right above where that guy Ryback is.
[234:01.87]We'll figure it out, I guess.
[234:29.27]Get out.
[234:36.49]Okay.
[234:38.17]Now we attempt to find the thing I was trying to find before.
[234:40.79]What is that cannon?
[234:46.17]Oh, come on.
[234:50.08]Wait.
[234:50.58]What the hell is that?
[234:52.08]Holy shit.
[234:52.74]Wait.
[234:52.96]I've never seen this before.
[234:54.08]I've never seen this before.
[234:55.62]I've never seen this before.
[234:56.56]What is this thing?
[234:59.20]Activate the gravity cannon.
[235:00.24]Have I been here?
[235:00.80]I've never been here before.
[235:03.42]The shuttle is currently resting at the quantum moon.
[235:05.86]No, I have.
[235:06.44]Yes, I have.
[235:08.05]Wait, there's like three of these.
[235:24.80]There's a couple of these.
[235:25.54]Have I been to this one in particular, though?
[235:34.23]Alright, I'm gonna fire the cannon.
[235:39.01]Bye!
[235:41.51]I don't know, I'm not sure where you're gonna go, but... Hold on a minute.
[235:51.63]Wait.
[235:53.35]At the very beginning of the game... At the very beginning of the game, somebody gets fired out of one of these cannons.
[236:04.73]What ship is it?
[236:08.77]Okay, well... Bring it back.
[236:14.41]Cool.
[236:14.67]Alright, shoot it again.
[236:21.27]Interesting.
[236:25.70]The crossroads.
[236:31.94]Yeah, they've been over there.
[236:39.86]Where does this go?
[236:45.36]Southern Observatory.
[236:47.29]Right.
[236:49.85]I can't get in here.
[236:52.47]Can I?
[236:55.67]Can I get into the Southern Observatory from here?
[236:59.95]That image is Psychological Warfare.
[237:02.09]I'm not going to click a link right now.
[237:04.18]I'm busy.
[237:05.96]I can't... I just have a controller in my hand.
[237:13.10]I'm gonna... I'm just... Let's see what's over here, I guess.
[237:15.38]Am I gonna make it across?
[237:23.27]Um... This is putting me... Where is this putting me?
[237:32.81]Why am I...
[237:38.29]This is back over here.
[237:39.79]Oh, this is so confusing.
[237:41.07]I don't even know what I'm even looking for right now.
[237:49.05]Actual wink?
[238:02.05]Southern Observatory.
[238:09.59]I can't even switch this now.
[238:36.66]If there's only one way I can go, I guess over here.
[238:43.41]Jump from platform to platform?
[238:45.95]Wait, what's that?
[238:46.95]Have I been over there?
[238:49.21]Wait a minute.
[238:49.51]Hold on.
[238:49.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[238:50.51]Should I jump?
[238:51.43]I don't know if I can make that.
[239:02.42]Black hole is there, but can I make that jump and then go into this...
[239:12.27]Okay.
[239:14.15]Then this leads into this weird blue thing.
[239:19.85]Wait.
[239:23.27]Is that it?
[239:23.63]I think that's it.
[239:29.28]Don't you fucking dare kill me.
[239:32.02]Don't you dare kill me.
[239:39.52]It almost did.
[239:40.36]It almost just dropped on my head.
[239:49.94]I need oxygen.
[239:52.59]But now where?
[239:53.21]Like... I don't know where to go.
[240:03.88]From... Why?
[240:14.05]I can't even... I have to squint to see.
[240:21.06]I actually am having trouble.
[240:36.55]Now what?
[240:46.32]I can't.
[240:47.08]I can't do this.
[240:48.02]I can't do it.
[240:48.52]I can't do it.
[240:52.22]This is too puke-inducing.
[240:53.42]I don't think I can do it.
[240:54.08]I can't do this.
[240:56.66]I can't do it.
[241:02.16]You can.
[241:02.60]You can.
[241:02.96]Yes, you can.
[241:03.50]I can't.
[241:03.82]I can't do it.
[241:12.36]Jump?
[241:18.16]Okay, one... Two...
[241:30.68]uh and then to there I just I don't I don't I don't know what direction I'm supposed to go I'm just gonna try I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing I don't know where I'm going but I'm gonna try and then jump into there
[242:01.82]I made it.
[242:02.10]This is inside the fucking circle.
[242:05.91]I made it inside the bubble.
[242:09.45]Don't watch that.
[242:10.69]That looks like a fall.
[242:11.85]Hold on.
[242:12.31]Slow down.
[242:13.25]What's in here?
[242:13.83]A lot of info in here.
[242:16.91]Lots of info.
[242:17.67]I don't know why Daz and I were lifting orbital probe cannon components into orbit for assembly and one somehow sank down beneath the current.
[242:32.25]Sava convinced me not to try to recreate the phenomenon myself using the other canon parts.
[242:38.27]We're very curious to know what happened.
[242:39.76]How could something pass through the current?
[242:44.00]My gratitude for your interesting question.
[242:45.62]This is exciting.
[242:46.46]Spire constructed a model of giants deep here at the Brittle Hollow's southern observatory.
[242:52.91]And it reveals how an object might sink below the current.
[242:59.76]You know, I'm unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool.
[243:03.89]If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?
[243:06.15]If you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole, I'd be delighted to see you.
[243:13.99]The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator, right?
[243:16.33]You know, you should have seen it.
[243:19.65]We thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink, even partial ability current.
[243:23.31]But ours sank straight to the core.
[243:24.61]Alright.
[243:40.51]I've seen this already.
[243:45.73]This is the construction yard.
[243:48.57]Scam wink?
[243:49.23]Nah, I know.
[243:50.01]I can smell a scam from a mile away, don't worry.
[243:53.16]Okay.
[243:58.24]Let's just keep going.
[244:06.39]Put tongue in there?
[244:07.33]Stick tongue out?
[244:10.14]Xava's construction yard has been using the cyclones on Giant's Deep to lift orbitable probe cannon parts into orbit.
[244:18.04]One component was pushed down past the current that usually prevents anything from sinking.
[244:22.07]Byron and I are crafting a model to determine why this happened.
[244:27.11]An update, it's now clear there are two different types of cyclone.
[244:32.63]Most cyclones on Giant's Deep rotate clockwise.
[244:35.03]These are the cyclones Xava typically uses to send components into orbit.
[244:40.24]There also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite direction, pushes objects beneath the water and below the current.
[244:49.58]My gratitude spire, Konoe is showing me your handiwork, and I'm intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone, but was it really necessary to build a model to tell me that?
[244:58.48]The model will be useful as we continue monitoring giants deep.
[245:05.27]Also, I very much wanted to make a model.
[245:09.93]Different kinds of cyclones one pushes you down is it on your nose?
[245:16.03]Oh, yeah, where?
[245:29.78]Go up here and see if there's anything else There's a lot of shit up here
[245:41.84]What is this?
[245:44.16]Teleporters?
[245:45.36]Let's see.
[245:49.20]What have we learned thus far in our search for the Eye of the Universe?
[245:53.51]Suppose the Eye doesn't wish to be found.
[245:56.91]Sava, how can you suggest that the Eye's signal called out to summon us to this star system?
[246:05.16]I'm aware I grew up hearing the Eye's story, yet we're no closer to finding it than you were when you first arrived here.
[246:12.39]Those of us on the vessel originally followed the eye's signal to this star system, but we were unable to warp to the eye itself.
[246:19.41]The locator we built on the Attle Rock and the new, more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the eye's signal.
[246:30.39]The eye has stopped emitting its signal.
[246:34.03]It's an impersonator.
[246:36.41]Based on our knowledge of the quantum moon, we believe the eye is in orbit around this star system's sun.
[246:43.17]This would mean the Eye is located within a finite range.
[246:49.27]Dammit.
[246:55.66]What is all this?
[247:07.42]How should our methods change as we continue our search for the Eye of the Universe?
[247:12.36]We know what the eye looks like thanks to the quantum moon, so what if we try to find the eye visually instead?
[247:17.20]Let's send out a probe.
[247:21.00]Paolo's idea is clever, but we have no idea where the eye is in relation to here.
[247:24.37]The probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.
[247:30.23]I believe I have a solution for that problem.
[247:32.01]Have you spoken with Rami and Pi about the technology they're developing?
[247:37.15]We need to build a probe launching mechanism to cover those long distances quickly.
[247:41.69]And in an orbit around a celestial body would circumvent the need to escape gravity's pull.
[247:47.85]Giant's Deep would be a good choice.
[247:50.35]It's furthest from the sun, so it will provide the best angles for launch, and it's moonless, except when the quantum moon is visiting.
[247:57.76]Yes, let's build the cannon in orbit around Giant's Deep.
[248:01.18]Since we couldn't find the eye signal using two different devices built for this exact purpose, we should discontinue this search method.
[248:09.90]Couldn't figure it out This whole this whole thing is all fucked up we're gonna zoom out we're gonna be like inside of a pupil of a baby You know, I mean, it's probably something like that.
[248:26.60]Whatever.
[248:27.10]What does this do?
[248:41.26]okay cool alright that's where all the that's where everything is that's what that one is alright let's get the whole thing up
[249:08.80]Oh, it's an atom!
[249:10.20]I figured it out!
[249:13.56]This is the Quantum Moons location.
[249:15.26]It could be anywhere.
[249:18.69]It could be anywhere.
[249:24.15]Look at all these different orbiting paths.
[249:30.94]Alright.
[249:33.74]I've done it.
[249:34.12]I did everything in the observatory.
[249:36.96]Now I have to go down a cyclone down to the bottom of the ocean.
[249:45.24]What's down here?
[249:45.82]Can I go in there?
[249:46.52]No.
[249:55.27]Where does this lead?
[250:01.58]I'm here.
[250:01.78]I did it.
[250:02.06]I put the ship down.
[250:02.80]Yeah, we already saw this.
[250:05.46]And he was like, I don't know why I can't get in here.
[250:07.22]Alright, that's done.
[250:16.44]I wish that was my ship.
[250:17.38]God damn it.
[250:17.90]It's not.
[250:19.71]Now we gotta go to... Don't die.
[250:31.98]um maybe I should just die yeah just die I know where to go now
[251:00.04]yeah it's gonna be a baby's eyes are gonna open and it's not it's not gonna be a video game it's gonna zoom out of a in real life video of a actual baby it's gonna zoom out of their closed eye and they're gonna open their eye and it's gonna be right when they were born and inside of their eye you can see all the planets and shit
[251:38.21]Load it into the computer.
[251:41.35]Tornado situation.
[251:42.75]Southern Observatory.
[251:45.01]So this is complete.
[251:46.59]The only thing that's missing is the ocean depths, which I now know how to do.
[251:50.44]I just have to... This looks pretty clean.
[251:55.86]It's only really the Ash Twin Project is the main thing.
[251:59.46]And this probe, I'm sure I'll unlock these too.
[252:01.56]And then...
[252:03.49]We only have a few things down here, and that's it, isn't it?
[252:06.78]Okay.
[252:08.36]Alright.
[252:12.50]Giant's Deep.
[252:23.07]Let's get sucked into an actual tornado.
[252:29.23]Time to get sucked in.
[252:38.02]Hepe left.
[252:38.56]He's on the tutorial galaxy.
[252:44.31]Alright, find me one of these things.
[253:05.83]Okay, they all spin in one direction.
[253:07.81]One's not spinning in the same direction.
[253:14.46]See if we can find it.
[253:16.16]Should I go in there with the ship?
[253:17.54]I think I'm going to go in there with the ship.
[253:29.67]So what direction you're both spinning you're both going That's going the other direction Which one of these is going the other direction Found it in the back
[254:02.38]There you are.
[254:06.20]You're not going in the same direction.
[254:09.34]Go ahead and throw us down, sir.
[254:16.99]Here we go.
[254:27.01]Okay.
[254:28.41]We... Whoa!
[254:31.25]There it is.
[254:33.62]Now... Now what?
[254:40.67]I don't want to touch this.
[254:42.09]I feel like I shouldn't touch this.
[254:49.58]It's electricity in water.
[254:51.24]Why would I want to touch it?
[255:05.02]I'm going in.
[255:14.74]You can't.
[255:16.75]I can't go in.
[255:19.57]Wait, hold on.
[255:21.13]I remember.
[255:21.93]I remember.
[255:22.61]I remember inside of a jellyfish you are protected from electricity.
[255:29.21]One of the only fucking things I remember.
[255:34.34]Alright, I need a jellyfish.
[255:36.66]Is that the only one that's here?
[255:37.62]Or is there one closer?
[255:42.16]In here.
[255:42.46]There's one over there.
[255:51.86]Can I get this thing to... Do I have to kill it?
[255:54.08]Alright, I'm going to drive into it and kill it.
[256:00.98]Okay, is it dead?
[256:02.52]I think I killed it.
[256:08.97]It's still electrified.
[256:09.83]How do you kill it?
[256:15.94]Inside of this.
[256:17.16]If you're inside of a jellyfish, you won't get electrocuted.
[256:21.54]How do I get in there?
[256:34.27]What the fuck?
[256:35.25]Ow, my chest.
[256:39.31]You explode underwater?
[256:41.11]What?
[256:42.19]My ship exploded underwater.
[256:49.44]Oh.
[256:52.66]So... I can't touch the jellyfish.
[256:56.88]How do I get inside the jellyfish then?
[257:13.82]What did that guy say?
[257:14.92]He said, oh, yeah, it tastes horrible, but what was his actual... Okay, yeah, I found that, but... He had, like, where's, like, the log?
[257:25.99]Can I see something?
[257:27.55]No.
[257:29.01]Oh, no, view entries.
[257:36.93]Uh... No, no, it's the other one.
[257:39.45]This one.
[257:40.12]Okay.
[257:57.06]Doesn't help me.
[258:04.93]I'll try it again.
[258:08.53]If I climb in it though, won't that just electrocute me when I touch it?
[258:15.62]Let's see what happens.
[258:26.35]Still haven't done anything really bad.
[258:29.65]Let's go.
[258:38.15]Yeah.
[258:39.11]In my brain... Do I have to hit the jellyfish in the head?
[258:46.00]Where there's no electricity.
[258:47.91]Or get out of the ship and stand on its head.
[259:06.49]I'll try climbing in.
[259:12.68]get out of the ship and I'll try to climb inside but there's nothing to climb in it's closed it's like closed up there's nothing like I can go in where is it
[260:01.80]You can't climb electricity.
[260:03.22]No, you can't.
[260:06.57]I'm going to take another look down there.
[260:07.97]I'm going to go to the bottom.
[260:15.41]Let's see.
[260:21.54]Let's go all the way to the bottom.
[260:22.62]I don't think this ship is going to explode or anything.
[260:28.46]Is there a bottom there?
[260:34.82]This is not just sitting on the bottom of the ocean?
[260:37.48]It's down here.
[260:38.00]Okay, I don't know.
[260:38.60]Let me see.
[260:38.90]Alright, we got jellyfish.
[260:41.93]Jellyfish going in.
[260:43.67]Jellyfish going in.
[260:46.51]That one goes in.
[260:51.45]Oh, he's going in for a dunk.
[260:57.89]Alright.
[260:58.29]Wait.
[261:02.04]Wait.
[261:04.86]Can I swim through that?
[261:20.27]Can I swim into that when he's done?
[261:31.83]Why is it leaving that trail?
[261:33.79]It's leaving that red spot.
[261:35.03]It can't be for no reason.
[261:44.65]I think the ship is too big to do that, isn't it?
[261:46.80]Let me get full fuel and oxygen and everything.
[262:05.42]I got 20 minutes.
[262:06.22]Don't worry.
[262:09.13]I should be able to swim through that after they go in.
[262:23.63]Hold on.
[262:24.23]I got an idea.
[262:31.39]Why do I think I can't touch the jellyfish?
[262:32.82]Because they're electrified and I bounced off.
[262:35.36]I'm trying this.
[262:40.26]Even if this doesn't work, I don't care.
[262:41.22]I'm just trying it.
[262:59.81]Why don't you just touch the jellyfish?
[263:02.66]What's wrong with you?
[263:03.36]Why do you think you can't?
[263:05.23]That didn't fucking work.
[263:36.97]Damn it!
[263:43.43]And now the ship got all the way back to the surface.
[263:45.42]Why?
[264:15.53]Alright, we're gonna try to swim inside.
[264:43.82]Am I in it?
[264:44.24]Am I in... Alright, I'll give you one reason why I don't like this.
[264:53.96]Because... How is this... This is not electrified.
[264:59.43]Everything else is, but like... Under here isn't?
[265:13.76]Are we in?
[265:14.14]I can't even see anything.
[265:18.63]Are we in?
[265:19.09]I don't even know if we're in.
[265:22.63]Oh!
[265:32.78]We're in.
[265:33.48]We're in, right?
[265:33.98]Alright, get out.
[265:41.47]Holy shit.
[265:42.39]Okay, I'm in.
[265:44.07]What's up and what's down?
[265:44.75]My flashlight doesn't work in here.
[265:49.05]What is that thing?
[265:53.31]That's an eye.
[265:53.92]Can I go in it?
[266:06.02]Why did my flashlight not work?
[266:16.61]Hold on, what's this?
[266:17.39]This is the can- Okay, this is- I'm gonna go in this way.
[266:24.36]It's the Eye of the Universe.
[266:26.06]Can I-
[266:38.19]Holy shit, I'm flying around.
[266:39.80]Alright, hold on.
[266:40.64]Otto wants to come in my room.
[266:42.79]I gotta get Otto.
[266:43.31]Hold on.
[267:49.48]Hello, dog.
[267:58.32]Hello, Atto.
[268:00.61]He's good, he's on his pillow.
[268:03.19]He's chillin' on his pillow.
[268:05.65]Hold on, I ripped my... How did I... How did I do this?
[268:16.77]I have no audio.
[268:19.55]Why do I have no audio?
[268:21.72]Oh, there we go.
[268:22.80]Alright, so here we are.
[268:25.94]New content.
[268:28.92]New content.
[268:29.64]Is this the probe?
[268:32.28]So wait a minute, is this... Anything in here?
[268:35.44]No.
[268:43.87]No.
[268:52.63]I know you're reading.
[268:53.91]What?
[268:55.04]Joe Otto.
[268:56.18]I can't.
[268:58.12]The camera's like, I'll show them later.
[269:00.04]I promise.
[269:00.76]I gotta get through this.
[269:02.88]I have exciting news.
[269:04.14]The Ash Twin Project is always prepared to receive the probe data from the Orbital Probe Cannon.
[269:10.48]Liar.
[269:16.40]No, I can't.
[269:17.26]I got, like, documents all over the ground.
[269:19.98]I got... Hold on.
[269:20.66]I've got... Hold on.
[269:21.92]I've got documents all over the ground.
[269:24.36]I swear to God.
[269:30.21]There's documents everywhere.
[269:31.69]And I can say, like, personally, I got so many fucking documents everywhere.
[269:44.52]They're surrounding me.
[269:50.52]What is this?
[269:51.06]Another document?
[269:56.64]Fancy desk with documents on the floor.
[270:02.94]You don't understand.
[270:07.57]My fancy desk in quotes for what you're saying is there's three monitors.
[270:13.63]Okay, I'm going to show Ato.
[270:17.35]He's all the way across the room.
[270:18.63]Hold on.
[270:23.83]If I accidentally show one of these documents, I'm gonna be so mad.
[270:27.82]Oh, nope.
[270:28.54]We got more documents over here.
[270:30.26]I can't.
[270:33.49]This room's covered in documents, I swear to God.
[270:41.66]I think I've cleared the room of all documents.
[270:54.00]Okay, you ready for your close-up, Otto?
[270:56.86]Here we go.
[271:23.69]Oh, wait, I see a stray document.
[271:38.77]Okay.
[271:40.75]No more documents?
[271:41.81]We're good.
[271:43.61]Otto's looking at me like, what the hell are you doing?
[272:12.34]Oh, you can't see.
[272:14.86]Hold on, hold on.
[272:34.46]Hi, Ido.
[272:36.53]Hello, Ido.
[272:38.91]Hello, Ido.
[272:43.56]Oh shit, I can see a document.
[272:48.31]Guys, I can't fucking move.
[272:51.61]Because one inch to your right is a bank document.
[272:55.89]I'm good.
[273:15.98]There you go.
[273:17.67]That's my special dog.
[273:26.51]I saw it.
[273:27.43]No, you didn't.
[273:30.31]Clean your room?
[273:31.75]It's just documents.
[273:32.57]It's not like it's shitty diapers or something.
[273:36.55]It's fine.
[273:37.09]Alright, here we go.
[273:47.80]Of exciting news, the Ashman Project is almost prepared to receive the probe.
[273:53.96]Remy is adding some finishing touches here, but she'll be finished soon.
[273:56.76]Are you in the orbital probe cannon well?
[274:02.95]We are.
[274:03.33]The probe tracking module is ready to record each launch's flight trajectory and will automatically transmit all relevant data to you.
[274:12.24]On other appendage, I'm now worried about this cannon's structural integrity and its crew's moral integrity.
[274:19.20]Once the probe determines the location of the Eye of the Universe, I'll send an alert directly to you and Raimi.
[274:25.86]Okay.
[274:32.84]We already saw this, but let's do this.
[274:34.23]Let's go into the quicksand.
[274:35.17]And... Okay.
[274:37.51]Okay.
[274:48.50]This is the Eye of the Universe.
[274:49.68]Like, whatever this is, this is the Eye of the Universe.
[274:51.60]Alright, what else is in here?
[275:13.91]Imagine, Privet, the probe tracking module will be the first to know the coordinates of the eye of the universe.
[275:19.11]You'll be the first to see them.
[275:22.04]I am honored and terrified.
[275:25.12]You won't ask the orbitable probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks, will you?
[275:30.67]I think we read this one.
[275:38.41]I would mind, Mallow.
[275:39.39]I would mind because we won't be capable of receiving our probe's data if the probe tracking module is destroyed.
[275:45.47]So where's the data?
[275:51.37]Where's the data?
[276:07.90]Zephyr explodes.
[276:23.35]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[276:25.47]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[276:26.13]This way.
[276:26.47]Where are you going?
[276:27.51]Over here.
[276:30.37]Okay.
[276:32.34]Okay, so...
[276:36.20]Here comes the data sphere.
[276:46.25]Uh... Jay Pot has redeemed Bernie Sanders for 34,000 points.
[276:54.43]Okay.
[276:57.55]Retrieving data from probe 9406.
[277:01.72]Visualizing current trajectory of probe 9406.
[277:09.48]Now what?
[277:11.63]Where's the data?
[277:39.78]Alright, that's what the sixth location looks like.
[277:45.36]Retrieving previous launch data from Ash Twin.
[277:52.71]Total number of probes launched 9406.
[277:54.47]Deep space anomaly matching all known criteria for the eye of the universe found by probe 9354.
[277:59.81]Somebody found it.
[278:20.83]Retrieving stored coordinates from Ash Twin.
[278:22.72]Displaying coordinates for the Eye of the Universe.
[278:35.72]Uh... Screenshot it.
[278:42.56]Okay, it's C... or like L...
[278:50.85]Uh, L-A-M.
[278:52.11]Whoa, what was that?
[278:53.81]It just blew by.
[278:55.43]Oh, whatever.
[278:58.35]I'll know.
[278:58.83]I guess somebody will remember it.
[278:59.89]Whoops.
[279:01.75]Okay, so I got the coordinates for the Eye of the Universe.
[279:07.13]I have the coordinates for the Eye of the Universe.
[279:08.51]I got it.
[279:09.01]I did it.
[279:10.06]Let's go.
[279:21.72]Alright, can you stop doing that for me?
[279:23.42]Alright, if you could stop doing that, that'd be very nice.
[279:33.24]Okay.
[279:47.34]Alright.
[279:48.78]I know the location of the Eye of the Universe.
[279:56.42]Anything else down here that I need to look at or see?
[280:00.58]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[280:27.56]A tree?
[280:45.91]I think I got everything I needed.
[280:47.47]I'm not sure there's anything else to do.
[280:51.29]It's just this weird tree core.
[280:58.48]Alright, let's go.
[280:58.98]Let's just get electrocuted to death.
[281:15.59]I could have swam through the whole time.
[281:30.05]I already tried that.
[281:33.87]Yeah, OK.
[281:42.96]Out is OK, I guess.
[281:43.98]Alright.
[281:54.13]Where is my shift?
[282:05.58]doing over here what are you doing over here what are you alright let's deposit this data let's see what we got probe tracking module all this has been revealed
[282:34.26]have the coordinates of the Eye of the Universe.
[282:35.82]There's only one or two real outliers here, and it's this shit at Ash Twin Project, and Black Hole Forge, and then the Hanging City, and then this anglerfish fossil.
[283:03.93]I don't have any more info on this.
[283:07.67]Let's go to Ash Twin.
[283:14.69]By this point, most of the sand will be gone, right?
[283:18.13]So I can kind of explore.
[283:33.28]Hold on a second.
[283:54.74]Oh, I forgot the big gravity in this.
[283:56.68]I forgot the gravity, the huge gravity in this planet.
[284:09.63]Yeah, I can't get the ship.
[284:10.85]I can't get back to the ship.
[284:11.59]Now I no longer have an access to the ship.
[284:19.29]I'm getting sucked away by the car.
[285:00.40]I'm trying to fucking die.
[285:05.38]I can't even die correctly.
[285:21.73]Just throw me in the air and let me just go die somewhere.
[285:29.96]Thank God the fucking sun's about to explode.
[285:40.17]I can't even go forward to go there.
[285:44.69]Please, just throw me here.
[285:47.65]Why are you not throwing... What?
[285:49.73]I'm standing inside of this tornado.
[285:51.37]Why am I not going up?
[285:54.20]What the fuck is happening?
[285:57.62]You can't suck me up?
[286:03.74]That's the down.
[286:04.72]That's the own.
[286:05.38]That's the down one.
[286:06.72]It's the down one of course it is Blow up so I can please I wish I could delete that water effect
[286:51.10]We need a good view.
[286:55.56]I don't know if there is a good view.
[286:58.08]Well, there's kind of a view.
[287:01.54]Here it comes.
[287:01.88]It's been a while to get here.
[287:25.06]Well, I did learn a lot, so that's good.
[287:48.07]Progress.
[288:00.49]What are you going to do, Nancy Drew?
[288:01.51]I don't know, do like an hour?
[288:09.06]Please note, do not hold any of these terms accountable for Jerma.
[288:13.49]He's not going to do these things.
[288:27.85]okay I want to go to the ash twin yep I think that's what I would like to do I still haven't figured out what this thing even does or why it exists I just know it's here
[289:05.42]You lied about FL Studio.
[289:06.99]Yeah, I did.
[289:08.71]I'll take that one.
[289:11.43]I did.
[289:14.53]Alright.
[289:20.96]Eye of the Universe.
[289:26.44]The twin project thing.
[289:48.07]land on it.
[289:48.65]Let's go.
[289:49.67]Alright.
[290:07.59]Now, I'm just gonna make sure that I have enough
[290:16.16]Irma, you're still as confused as me about this game.
[290:20.67]I have a very basic understanding of what's going on.
[290:23.69]But... An incredibly basic understanding of what's going on.
[290:29.69]There's this group of alien people who... Wanted to find the eye of the universe.
[290:37.71]And it wiped them out.
[290:40.27]And they may have wiped out everything here.
[290:42.79]Which also wiped us out.
[290:46.65]The ship.
[290:47.21]Oh, no.
[290:47.51]The ship's gonna get grabbed.
[290:49.45]No, the ship's gonna get grabbed by this.
[290:52.05]This happens to me every time.
[290:53.77]Oh, come on.
[290:59.94]Why?
[291:00.54]I'm going for it.
[291:16.31]I'm going so fast!
[291:18.01]Just get on the beam!
[291:21.51]Okay, we're good.
[291:34.79]Okay.
[291:35.60]Good.
[291:37.02]Heal.
[291:57.10]Where am I?
[291:58.80]We're getting buried alive.
[292:04.30]Okay, good.
[292:07.22]Very good.
[292:08.40]Very good.
[292:09.88]Excellent.
[292:10.48]Hey, we burnt some time.
[292:14.04]Hey, I wonder if that sand planet's a little lower than it was before.
[292:22.01]This time, make sure it's not in the trajectory of the sand.
[292:27.32]It would be very nice if you did that.
[292:29.96]Go ahead and get over there.
[292:49.25]No, I'm not gonna land on the equator again.
[292:51.39]I'm not gonna land on the equator.
[292:52.87]He's waiting for it to come by.
[293:30.46]This is where I want to be.
[293:33.16]I don't care.
[293:33.64]Just crash.
[293:37.28]Don't land on the fucking equator.
[293:43.29]Okay.
[293:44.09]Right here is good.
[293:53.49]Let's see what happens.
[294:00.04]There's two on either side of this planet.
[294:04.67]When this goes to zero, it triggers the event.
[294:09.59]When all the sand is gone, it triggers the event to bring me back to life.
[294:17.75]Did the cactus jump?
[294:20.67]No.
[294:28.82]You're not dead.
[294:29.56]I will be.
[294:32.30]This whole... This is where the masks are stored, which is where I... You store the memories of the last person.
[294:49.67]Just control my breathing.
[294:50.73]Just hang out for a little bit.
[294:58.01]Can I try Cactus Jump?
[294:59.19]Alright, I'll try Cactus Jump.
[295:03.82]No, no, I'm not gonna do that.
[295:40.52]What is this?
[295:43.84]Which I still don't know exactly what this is for.
[295:47.16]Let's get a look at it.
[295:50.76]Some ancient town.
[295:52.56]I don't know.
[295:53.82]Cactus.
[296:09.72]Was this person here before?
[296:10.56]There's a cactus.
[296:45.70]I hit him.
[296:48.52]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[296:49.32]This is in the trajectory of... I can't get in.
[296:53.87]No, yeah, I gotta put the chip.
[296:58.27]Alright, it's starting to... Let me get in the ship.
[297:08.22]Get the hell out of here.
[297:20.03]Here it comes.
[297:20.57]Alright.
[297:21.45]What?
[297:22.41]There's gotta be some entrance.
[297:25.90]Pumpkin Smasher.
[297:28.14]Pumpkin Smasher just gave $100, another 10,000 bit donation to the stream.
[297:33.78]Ridiculous.
[297:36.16]You guys are crazy.
[297:37.57]Giving that much money.
[297:39.15]But holy fuck, thank you.
[297:42.05]10,000 bits.
[297:43.21]Huge bits.
[297:44.33]They say, Hey, Jerma, show your beautiful face for the rest of the stream.
[297:50.31]I'm not going to do that.
[297:51.15]I don't do facecam unless I'm playing a horror game or I'm showing my nose.
[297:55.65]Also, I want you to rest easy and know that your rent's going to be paid this month, so you can upload more content.
[298:05.84]Or if a wink gets redeemed.
[298:12.40]So I can upload more?
[298:15.50]Well, I can make some more streams.
[298:17.98]That's fun.
[298:20.70]But thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[298:22.34]I'll give you, look, I'll give you a wink.
[298:29.68]What is this?
[298:30.92]This is new.
[298:35.54]Whatever this is, this is new.
[298:37.34]I haven't seen this before.
[298:45.00]Oh shit, a document leaked.
[298:48.18]Pumpkin Smasher just gave 150 more dolls.
[298:52.01]Pumpkin Smasher.
[298:52.77]15,000 more bits.
[298:56.27]Thanks for the wink.
[298:57.13]Here's some more.
[298:57.95]Thanks for the huge money.
[299:04.06]Pumpkin Smasher.
[299:05.04]For the love of God.
[299:06.44]That's a lot of money.
[299:08.86]Thank you.
[299:10.84]Billionaires in chat.
[299:12.46]Double wink?
[299:13.26]Alright.
[299:15.34]Where am I going?
[299:15.80]What's going on?
[299:16.32]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[299:51.93]I tried to whip back around.
[299:56.55]Am I ever going to have enough... Am I ever going to be able to sit here for 20 minutes to have this planet become an actual thing I can see?
[300:02.85]Or is something going to happen to me within the 20 fucking minutes I have to do this?
[300:14.34]Sleep at a campfire.
[300:22.86]Oh.
[300:37.21]You can't AFK.
[300:42.21]It's too bad.
[300:45.78]Okay, I'm gonna go here.
[300:46.70]I'm gonna sleep at a campfire.
[300:52.53]And we're gonna try this again.
[301:09.24]Yeah, no, there's a campfire on that, uh, with the dude playing the guitar.
[301:12.24]There's a NPC up here, and he has a campfire, doesn't he?
[301:23.01]Yeah, there's a campfire.
[301:26.31]That much I know, at least.
[301:38.46]Just use the sun as a campfire.
[301:39.70]Yeah, why can't I just... I can't just close my eyes right here and just wake up in six hours?
[301:47.99]I guess I could That's just sleeping.
[301:50.50]I could do that, but I'm piloting a ship.
[301:52.52]I don't think I'd want to do that Okay
[302:16.98]go to the campfire, and let's sleep, and then let's try to figure out
[302:24.29]Stay down, please.
[302:26.45]Am I landed?
[302:28.08]I'm staying.
[302:28.56]No, fuck the fuck up.
[302:29.64]I'm not going.
[302:30.42]No, no.
[302:31.58]This thing's going to take off again.
[302:32.88]I'm on the equator.
[302:34.56]No, I'm not doing that for the fucking tenth time.
[302:36.44]I knew it.
[302:36.84]I saw you.
[302:37.50]See, I saw you.
[302:38.81]I knew it.
[302:39.71]I'm not fucking this up again.
[302:41.63]Nope.
[302:42.43]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[302:44.11]Not going to happen.
[302:45.93]Uh-oh.
[302:47.77]I almost did it again.
[302:48.41]Aye, aye, aye, aye.
[302:55.64]At least I saw the train coming down the track this time.
[302:57.60]Alright, now I just want to find that person.
[303:02.98]Let's just pull up the crazy over here.
[303:17.21]Left bumper tilt.
[303:29.77]Dude, I wish I could fly this ship with my eyes.
[303:33.75]Where is this guy?
[303:34.45]Like, I wish I could turn my head and fly.
[303:42.28]Rather than, like, hold, left bumper, tilt, right stick, left stick.
[303:45.08]No.
[303:45.34]I want to use my fucking eyes and head.
[303:48.86]I want to tilt my head.
[303:52.26]What guy?
[303:52.72]There's a guy here.
[303:55.52]Where's the guy?
[304:01.73]This is the wrong planet.
[304:04.69]He's on the other planet.
[304:06.92]Is there actually no campfire here?
[304:11.90]There is no campfire here.
[304:18.53]He's on ember.
[304:20.63]Oh, motherfucker.
[304:21.75]Really?
[304:22.05]There's a guy in the sand?
[304:29.64]Yeah, I, yeah, there's not a guy in the sand.
[304:32.30]It's alright, he's right here.
[304:55.56]How much time passes when you do this?
[305:16.65]That was off.
[305:21.11]Four, five, six, seven... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[305:24.17]Are these minutes or seconds?
[305:25.81]Hold on.
[305:26.38]I was going to say, holy shit, that's going fast.
[305:44.87]What should I do?
[305:45.43]Ten minutes?
[305:59.02]Okay.
[306:01.66]That's about two.
[306:04.13]No, I'm gonna do more.
[306:10.90]Do another like three or four?
[306:29.41]Three.
[306:29.75]Three and a half.
[306:47.76]Just sleep until the supernova happens.
[306:50.04]That would be so bad.
[306:52.60]I chart.
[306:53.00]Oh, it's you.
[306:53.42]I have a question for you.
[306:55.86]I found something.
[306:57.06]I found... Isn't this time supposed to freeze?
[307:03.57]I don't know that much about what's out there.
[307:04.89]Okay.
[307:07.53]Question for you.
[307:08.97]Where should I explore?
[307:09.61]I haven't left this lake bed.
[307:11.41]Have you seen the old shipwreck on Ember's Twin, Southern Hemisphere?
[307:15.19]Oh, yeah, I think I've already done that.
[307:17.21]I don't have time for this.
[307:20.46]found something.
[307:20.90]I found the quantum moon.
[307:22.42]Everyone loves a good mystery.
[307:23.30]Alright, I don't have time for this.
[307:24.21]I literally don't have time to talk to you.
[307:25.83]Bye.
[307:26.03]Goodbye.
[307:29.88]Alright, I'm going back.
[307:50.70]Alright, that should be good.
[307:56.60]I looked over and saw that the satellite part had barely even gotten breached.
[308:06.92]Okay.
[308:08.36]Here we go.
[308:11.68]So there is all kinds of shit in here now.
[308:17.53]Which one?
[308:17.83]What do I go to?
[308:23.97]This over here.
[308:27.70]Not sure what I should do first.
[308:34.20]What are you doing?
[308:44.21]Okay.
[308:48.14]Okay.
[308:51.65]What do I do?
[308:52.19]What should I do first?
[308:53.85]Something with the satellite things?
[309:02.18]It's still going, but... One of those little buildings to go in?
[309:13.41]What under here?
[309:16.95]Let me look.
[309:19.23]Anything under here yet?
[309:24.69]Not really.
[309:26.29]What is this tower?
[309:38.83]Anything else on the surface level?
[309:59.47]on this one it's still going though dark don't please stop stop stop
[310:31.95]Look at all this shit, but there's nothing down here.
[310:40.31]Um... I just wanted to see what was beneath the sand.
[311:06.97]Okay, I think this is stopped.
[311:09.95]Still going?
[311:10.47]No, still going.
[311:18.83]I can go in here.
[311:19.57]The door opened in here.
[311:20.75]There's an opening.
[311:22.38]Who cares?
[311:24.50]This just brings me to the top where I know where I was before.
[311:31.14]I've already been up here.
[311:31.78]This is the bridge.
[311:48.19]This shit is coming in right now.
[311:50.33]It's gonna do the same thing it did last time.
[312:06.11]Does this eventually get something at the base?
[312:15.47]Or is it something deep buried in here?
[312:18.65]I don't know.
[312:19.05]I have no idea.
[312:29.68]I've already been up top.
[312:33.70]Here we go.
[312:35.36]Yeah, I've been up top before.
[312:37.42]Here's the entrance.
[313:02.12]is it dropping anymore it still is is there anything else in the bottom of this chip is gone well I mean we have like three minutes before it ends I'm not leaving this planet alright so this is now what happens if I is there only did I have to go up the middle but haven't I already been up here
[313:33.42]Yeah, I've already been up here.
[313:34.93]This doesn't do anything for me.
[313:45.21]Well, now I'm going to be able to see everything.
[313:48.11]What the fuck is down there?
[313:49.14]Alright, it's just like the meatball.
[313:54.54]This is the meatball core.
[313:55.76]Okay.
[314:00.02]Okay.
[314:11.41]Right in here?
[314:11.97]I already went in here.
[314:16.09]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[314:29.12]Like, the sun's about to explode.
[314:33.06]Gotta go in the cactus tower.
[314:37.16]There's no more sand to pour.
[314:41.31]Nothing in here, right?
[314:43.53]Nothing in here.
[314:49.74]Can I... I can walk up this.
[314:53.50]Can I walk down this?
[314:56.16]I've done this already, though.
[314:57.68]What the fuck is this?
[314:59.10]Where's this from?
[315:00.28]What is that?
[315:01.69]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[315:02.43]No, no, what?
[315:02.93]Have I...
[315:11.79]Get in there!
[315:21.47]Here's the first delivery.
[315:22.35]Fresh from the Black Hole Forge.
[315:27.33]No, I've been here before, I think.
[315:30.83]Once.
[315:31.03]Yeah, I've been here once.
[315:33.79]I'm going to meet at the station.
[315:39.86]I've been here once, yeah.
[315:44.01]Oh, I'm dead.
[315:52.79]I didn't learn anything.
[316:08.04]So... There's other buildings that are on that equator.
[316:20.54]How many more are there?
[316:35.67]Keep going with the same ones.
[316:37.79]Everything just kind of blends together.
[316:55.70]Let me look at the notes.
[317:02.00]Alright.
[317:07.58]Yes, they did.
[317:08.30]They want to know if it's 22 minute negative time and if it was possible to conclude.
[317:14.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[317:25.49]Designs for each of the towers on Ashton's equator.
[317:27.51]Each tower warps to a different planet.
[317:29.95]This tower was designed to visually reflect its warp destination.
[317:36.38]Yeah, but... Alright.
[317:44.94]I'm gonna go back, and I'm just gonna ride the equator.
[317:47.18]Okay.
[318:00.76]Try Cactus Tower again.
[318:02.08]Maybe.
[318:08.96]You know what the problem is?
[318:09.96]This planet always starts just a circle.
[318:13.96]So it's not like... Everything gradually comes out of the ground.
[318:19.02]Let me try to get to the cactus.
[318:25.20]I don't even remember where the cactus room is.
[318:40.69]Was it one of the equator ones?
[318:41.93]It was part of the equator, wasn't it?
[318:59.87]It's both the poles of these giant, huge satellite things.
[319:20.99]Alright, I'm not on the equator, right?
[319:23.21]Good.
[319:34.90]Alright, so where's that cactus?
[319:39.46]Where's the cactus one?
[319:41.82]On the equator?
[319:49.86]Too fast!
[319:54.19]Is this it?
[319:54.45]Alright, let's go.
[320:03.17]Get in.
[320:10.15]Alright, this is literally right in the middle on the equator.
[320:13.18]I know what it looks like.
[320:14.24]It's got a weird star shape.
[320:17.64]I can't get in there yet.
[320:18.34]I need an entrance.
[320:22.94]Besides, the entrance is going to be on...
[320:39.50]Cactus run hard mode.
[320:49.09]There it is.
[320:50.23]Alright.
[320:51.69]Open.
[320:53.49]Come on, hurry up.
[320:55.10]Is it broken?
[320:55.60]This fucking thing's broken.
[320:58.26]I can't...
[321:23.20]It's right here.
[321:26.64]That's not... It's gonna cross over on me!
[321:28.36]Alright.
[321:43.13]It is immediately to the right.
[321:44.83]Cactus room.
[321:45.55]Go through the cactuses.
[321:46.44]Be careful.
[321:48.00]Go!
[322:08.33]Oh shit!
[322:14.30]Wait.
[322:14.64]What's that do?
[322:15.26]It didn't do anything.
[322:25.43]What's this?
[322:26.47]What's that?
[322:27.83]What's this?
[322:37.50]Somebody just said, look up at the ground.
[322:39.75]How do you look up at the ground?
[322:59.62]I knew we were going to fucking pour it into the sun station.
[323:02.90]I knew it.
[323:03.60]I told you.
[323:05.10]I told you guys.
[323:07.24]I knew it.
[323:07.64]Remember when I freaked out and started screaming about this game and I was like, there's no fucking way I have to do this.
[323:15.42]There's no way.
[323:16.04]I have to fucking pour it.
[323:19.74]I knew it.
[323:20.08]281,000 years ago, no user commands received for 10 minutes.
[323:24.67]All systems entering sleep.
[323:27.71]I didn't want to do that.
[323:28.51]I didn't want to do that.
[324:02.02]No, no.
[324:08.78]No, no, no.
[324:10.16]I didn't think, I didn't know that was, I didn't know opening the fucking door.
[324:12.93]Oh my god.
[324:13.65]I'm gonna be, I'm gonna scream.
[324:17.23]Opening the door and walking forward.
[324:18.87]It was a trap.
[324:29.04]You have to actually float into the other room.
[324:33.10]That's so finicky and so annoying to do that.
[324:39.17]Holy shit.
[324:49.98]I'd rather drive there with my ship.
[325:07.61]do it then I didn't get any new info oh at least I know how to what to do now it's cactus room
[325:58.54]Fuck me.
[326:05.35]I'm so close to learning the secret.
[326:12.28]Why am I going so... What's going... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[326:14.52]I'm sorry.
[326:14.86]I'm sorry.
[326:15.16]Use it.
[326:15.44]Star Wars it.
[326:16.06]Star Wars it.
[326:17.51]I'm fine.
[326:32.84]Dude, can you please?
[326:53.17]Wait, am I in the equator?
[326:54.05]It's okay, it's just a car wash.
[327:04.60]There's just a car wash.
[327:06.82]We're fine.
[327:07.52]Get me off the equator.
[327:19.90]Alright.
[327:21.04]Into the... I'm not back on the equator.
[327:27.60]I'm not back on the equator.
[327:28.88]I moved away from the equator.
[327:36.57]Oh my god.
[327:38.43]Okay.
[327:39.51]Let's get back to the cactus tower.
[327:40.87]And I gotta float into this.
[327:45.57]You wanna chill by the camp?
[327:47.11]Nope.
[327:47.51]I'm not.
[327:48.51]I'm staying right here.
[327:50.11]This is where I'm gonna be.
[327:51.36]This is my spot.
[327:52.42]This is where I'm gonna be for a little while.
[327:54.36]Yep.
[327:54.78]This is where I'm gonna be.
[327:58.44]Wait.
[327:58.60]Hold on.
[327:59.68]What's going on?
[328:07.19]We had 5,000 bits from Freakout.
[328:10.19]More than that.
[328:15.51]We had like $100 from Freakout.
[328:20.74]And more of these weird code.
[328:22.56]I don't even know what this is.
[328:28.08]Oh, this is the code guy.
[328:29.50]This is the code guy.
[328:33.56]I have no idea what the hell this is.
[328:36.66]I don't know why you keep doing this, but, uh... No, don't put those codes in chat, please.
[328:48.69]I don't know what they are.
[328:49.63]I can't condone them.
[328:50.51]I have no idea what the hell they are.
[329:04.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[329:06.38]I don't know what they are.
[329:07.60]I don't know what they are.
[329:09.26]It's a bunch of codes.
[329:11.46]Thanks for the huge amount of fucking money, Jesus, but I don't know what these codes are, man.
[329:17.55]Why am I paused?
[329:18.61]Because I'm reading a bit donation from the Codemaster.
[329:34.90]They also say, Hey Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few years.
[329:36.74]After being with my girlfriend for a while now, I decided I was comfortable enough to introduce her to your streams.
[329:41.08]However, this was not what she wanted.
[329:42.38]What she did want was to sleep with one of my high school friends behind my back.
[329:46.40]Oh, shit.
[329:49.66]I've been single for three years now.
[329:50.96]I've decided that now is the time to get back in the dating scene, but I just wanted to ask you, what are... What?
[329:58.42]What?
[329:58.86]What?
[329:59.39]What?! !
[330:02.50]What's going on?
[330:03.34]What?
[330:03.66]Why is it already freaking out?
[330:05.77]Alright.
[330:06.17]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[330:07.59]I don't know what to do.
[330:10.81]When we got like a thousand like launch codes and then everyone, I'm reading a donation.
[330:16.27]Everyone's saying, stop reading.
[330:17.65]And I'm like, what the, I don't know what the fuck is happening.
[330:19.87]This is just a lot of money.
[330:29.95]I said, by the way, if you haven't seen... If you've... By the way... If you haven't seen your one anime, I recommend Welcome to the N... H... I don't know what this is.
[330:43.70]I'm done.
[330:43.94]I don't know what this is.
[330:51.34]It's a good anime.
[330:52.20]This is real?
[330:55.66]This is a real thing?
[330:57.42]Alright.
[330:57.90]This is real?
[331:00.34]It's a real anime.
[331:00.96]Okay, this is anime.
[331:01.78]Alright, this is not like porn launch codes.
[331:04.01]Okay.
[331:07.49]Uh, welcome to the NHK.
[331:08.91]The art style isn't great.
[331:09.85]It deals with issues rampant in our society.
[331:12.07]That's cool.
[331:13.15]There's such as drug abuse, depression, social anxiety.
[331:16.08]Okay.
[331:17.94]It's only 24 episodes and it should be something you can watch without burning out.
[331:20.72]That's cool.
[331:28.06]Watching porn in T-minus 22 minutes.
[331:32.56]He's not going to watch it, let's be honest.
[331:34.16]Get out of here.
[331:38.22]Alright.
[331:38.58]Thank you for these fucking... I gotta ask.
[331:44.89]Can you not do any more cool codes?
[331:48.71]You're freaking me out with the codes.
[331:49.99]I'll be real honest with you.
[331:53.22]This weird monster spam of code links is freaking me out a little.
[332:07.31]Although I do appreciate your ridiculous amount of money.
[332:19.34]That's $100 from Freakout.
[332:24.78]No, if you post them, you're going to get dropped.
[332:27.82]Don't do it.
[332:28.44]I'm telling you, if you post those codes, you're going to get dropped by one of the mods.
[332:31.52]It's going to happen.
[332:32.98]You're going to get dropped for like probably 20, you're going to get like a 30 minute.
[332:36.10]Don't do it.
[332:37.07]I'm just telling you, I'm just trying to be real with you.
[332:52.61]Jerm is so gullible I don't know what the hell I'm what do you want me to do somebody drops a hundred bucks in bits and I'm gonna I'm gonna read what they say and then it's like well oh I can't believe you read that
[333:32.44]Why has the game devolved?
[333:34.42]Well, it's because I'm waiting to do cactus run again.
[333:37.43]To fly into the station.
[333:38.63]This is my fault.
[333:40.47]This is my own fault.
[333:41.25]Somebody just redeemed a link.
[333:48.78]In the middle of all this.
[333:49.64]Alright, other side.
[333:56.18]Pack this run, and then we're going up, and I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I didn't... I couldn't see.
[334:00.64]I'm not gonna just walk out immediately.
[334:02.82]I don't know why I thought there was, like, a door.
[334:04.60]Wait, we're gonna... One more, uh... Uh, big straw-suck thing.
[334:14.03]You wasted it?
[334:14.69]What?
[334:14.85]What?
[334:26.63]Alright, let's do it.
[334:42.74]Same deal.
[334:43.62]And then I'm just gonna... I'm so bad with free floating.
[334:48.96]I'm just gonna take like ten attempts.
[334:53.83]Son of a goddammit.
[334:54.93]Son of a goddammit!
[334:57.70]No fucking way.
[334:58.58]No way.
[334:59.20]No way!
[335:00.14]Not a chance.
[335:00.80]No way!
[335:04.78]No way!
[335:13.01]Been sitting in my car, I guess, now for days.
[335:25.69]If I suffocate, I'm going to be really... This is not... I can't... This is not trees.
[335:29.87]That's not a real tree.
[335:31.54]Where's the station?
[335:32.22]Please.
[335:37.81]Hurry up.
[335:58.02]What the hell?
[335:59.56]I'm gonna run out of oxygen.
[336:09.65]Alright, where is... Is it just right there, straight ahead?
[336:13.83]Alright, I'm just gonna go straight out.
[336:33.53]This is way harder than it looks.
[336:42.30]That's... I can't climb up.
[336:43.76]Do I have to jump?
[336:57.92]Press left triggers to go down.
[337:02.33]Because the right trigger is the one that's for... A and right trigger is the thrusters.
[337:11.73]Just say you hate this game already.
[337:13.43]Ow!
[337:13.49]That's so funny.
[337:31.11]I mess up like a tricky sequence twice.
[337:35.33]All of a sudden it's like dude just like admit you fucking hate this game like I mean come on man.
[337:46.80]Oh fuck.
[337:55.64]Slow down.
[338:02.10]I'm so close to the end of the game.
[338:03.97]Like, seriously.
[338:05.87]It's in the sun station.
[338:07.73]You pick up a block of wood and you stick it in your mouth and read it.
[338:14.82]I can't go full tilt here.
[338:39.69]If only he knew how to control.
[338:41.21]No, it's not that.
[338:43.78]And I have, like, two minutes of oxygen remaining, too.
[338:47.06]So, like, all this stuff is going in my mind.
[338:48.60]If I don't get it this time, it's not going to happen.
[338:52.14]I'm just going to be completely honest with you.
[339:02.50]No, I jumped out and my character started turning.
[339:06.93]I didn't press any buttons.
[339:07.87]He just started going like this.
[339:09.65]I didn't press anything.
[339:10.37]It just started moving on its own.
[339:31.76]That's the point.
[339:32.24]Just don't touch anything.
[339:34.76]So, just walk out and don't even... Just put the controller down.
[339:38.72]Is that for real?
[339:44.63]Skip time.
[339:45.21]Yeah, I'm going to the other planet.
[339:47.47]No, no.
[339:47.97]Why would I... That's a one-guy comment.
[339:49.75]Why would I listen to that?
[340:02.61]Alright, let's go sleep.
[340:09.98]Where's the campfire?
[340:17.73]There he is.
[340:18.13]Dude, I'm fucking just gonna land on this motherfucker.
[340:25.88]What do I care?
[340:45.89]Can I use your fire, please, to go to bed?
[340:49.09]Thank you.
[340:50.27]Magical golden fucking goose egg.
[341:16.45]I'm gonna try.
[341:16.89]I gotta get it this time.
[341:18.03]I know it's gonna be hard for me to do.
[341:21.61]I know it is.
[341:27.29]But come on.
[341:36.03]I'm telling you, man, you don't move.
[341:37.57]I'm telling you, you don't move.
[341:38.91]What?
[341:41.57]Why am I being told, man, to not move by people?
[341:48.00]I'm telling you, man, just don't move.
[341:49.84]I think I missed the opportunity.
[341:53.52]Wait, hold on.
[341:54.38]Did I sleep too long?
[341:57.98]Wait a minute.
[341:59.92]Stay by the ship, I don't fucking care.
[342:03.42]I slept too long, didn't I?
[342:16.20]I slept too long.
[342:33.65]Not that one.
[342:38.41]What the hell was that?
[342:41.46]What am I doing?
[342:45.04]Trying to find that... It's the other tower.
[342:47.68]Wait, I went past it, did I?
[342:49.20]Wait...
[342:54.61]Is it that one?
[342:57.19]It's this one right here?
[342:58.11]Oh, fuck, it is this one.
[343:01.23]Well, it's too late.
[343:01.79]I lose.
[343:02.05]I was too late anyways.
[343:05.70]I wouldn't have been able to do it anyways.
[343:18.69]Top five fucking gaming moments of 2020.
[343:20.15]There it is.
[343:26.05]Write that one down.
[343:28.21]Alright.
[343:28.59]Get the fuck out of here.
[343:43.52]That's not impressive.
[343:46.14]I know it's not impressive.
[343:49.17]Alright.
[343:49.85]Do I listen to the one guy and just hold A while I go forward and that's it?
[343:57.95]Walk off and don't move.
[343:59.65]Oh, don't say that.
[344:01.97]Just hold A. Walk out and hold A. Don't press anything.
[344:09.20]Match velocity.
[344:11.44]Station can't be targeted.
[344:12.46]Just don't press any buttons.
[344:13.88]I'm not gonna press anything.
[344:20.09]But, what about... You were wrong!
[344:22.71]You were wrong!
[344:28.74]Got it!
[344:29.26]Okay, I got it.
[344:35.07]Okay, I made it.
[344:35.75]Can't we change this?
[344:36.87]I don't enjoy working in view of such a morbid mission statement.
[344:59.04]But it's accurate.
[344:59.70]We're going to create a supernova for the purpose of scientific progress.
[345:03.56]That's our mission.
[345:04.30]Our mission is to decide if such an irresponsible feat is even possible.
[345:08.75]So they did it.
[345:12.59]Here's a better one.
[345:13.37]Mission.
[345:13.67]Determine if it's possible to prompt the sun to explode.
[345:16.13]Why do they want the sun to... Why are you doing this?
[345:19.97]You lack a sense of humor.
[345:23.41]At least I don't lack a sense of ethics.
[345:27.57]Kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the sun does.
[345:34.16]Oh, sorry.
[345:34.70]You're dead.
[345:38.95]Buy the masks, little go-karts.
[345:53.14]Wait, are they, like, bugs?
[345:55.02]Is this, like, a person lying down?
[345:56.80]Are they, like, weird beetle people?
[345:58.80]Or is that just, like, a storage unit?
[346:00.24]I don't know.
[346:02.02]No, I saw a guy wearing one of these.
[346:03.12]Alright, let's go.
[346:05.33]Let's go in.
[346:06.51]I could go up, but... Let's go down first.
[346:09.27]Wait.
[346:09.93]That's... The sun is down there.
[346:12.15]The sun's down there.
[346:12.93]The sun is in there.
[346:15.17]Let's go up.
[346:31.05]There's nothing up here.
[346:44.67]Oh.
[346:46.05]Very well up in there.
[346:52.65]What the fuck just happened to me?
[347:03.00]What is going on?
[347:05.03]What?
[347:05.23]I didn't run out of time.
[347:15.44]I ran out of time.
[347:18.78]The supernova didn't happen.
[347:23.12]The sun was expand- Well, I'm trying to like explore.
[347:28.04]Okay, on the back of the game's cereal box, it's like explore everything and look at stuff and read stuff.
[347:41.35]I had to go down.
[347:42.25]Well, how am I?
[347:42.99]Okay.
[347:44.67]How am I supposed to know I was supposed to go down first?
[347:48.04]There was a way to go up.
[347:51.32]I don't have that info.
[347:58.84]Well, we're going to do it again.
[347:59.80]It's a setting that pauses time while reading.
[348:07.16]Why is that not enabled automatically?
[348:11.73]It is.
[348:11.95]It is.
[348:15.55]It is.
[348:17.79]It's on.
[348:18.95]Alright, let me do this again.
[348:36.55]I turned around like five fucking times.
[348:38.07]Where the hell am I going?
[348:38.85]I have to do this shit.
[348:44.53]Use the... I gotta use the fire.
[348:53.08]What was that?
[348:55.18]Don't do that.
[348:55.76]Don't do what?
[348:56.56]What are you talking about?
[349:00.79]Wait, what are you... Don't do that.
[349:01.87]What was that noise?
[349:02.47]What do you mean?
[349:02.89]What noise?
[349:03.25]What are you talking about?
[349:08.11]A noise?
[349:11.36]Not you.
[349:12.32]Oh.
[349:12.44]I was like, what?
[349:13.17]Like there's a noise in my room?
[349:41.64]slow it down okay we're on the equator I'm on the equator every time am I yes I am move it out of the way right here should be good no like right here this is fine would you please stop rolling the around
[350:20.04]Use the campfire at the start.
[350:21.26]Yo, signal boost this shit.
[350:23.17]Yeah, retweet it.
[350:24.19]Everybody retweet it.
[350:26.61]Alright, where is it?
[350:51.16]Retweet at the campfire.
[350:53.01]How is it not popped up yet?
[350:57.53]Alright, you guys see any good movies?
[351:21.45]Stand here.
[351:24.23]No, I have to go into the sun.
[351:25.76]I have to float over there again.
[351:27.58]And you saw how horrendous that was.
[351:29.44]I have to do that again.
[351:31.14]I was so hoping I was never going to have to do that ever fucking again.
[351:34.40]And I have to do it again.
[351:52.44]Match velocity?
[351:53.18]I can't because you have to have something to target to match the velocity.
[351:55.54]I will match the velocity of the sun and fly right into it.
[352:09.89]Okay, here we go.
[352:10.53]Pass us through and then we go.
[352:17.59]Don't touch anything.
[352:18.21]That's what I did last time and it was a disaster.
[352:19.99]And I ended up just freaking out and fixing it.
[352:40.05]Alright, let's go.
[353:05.71]Okay, one, two, three.
[353:09.09]That's bullshit.
[353:10.71]You're right.
[353:12.07]That's ridiculous.
[353:14.73]Just ridiculous.
[353:16.17]Just ridiculous.
[353:29.52]I have to do the jump.
[353:30.58]Alright, I'll get it.
[353:39.67]Jeremy, fall into the sun for fun, Elbert said.
[353:42.43]Stop saying that.
[353:43.19]I was going to say, why did it not work?
[354:06.95]Okay, left trigger, right trigger, left trigger, right trigger, left trigger, right trigger.
[354:12.22]And then go down.
[354:13.10]Here we go.
[354:38.68]Okay.
[354:39.80]Now go down.
[354:53.43]What's in here?
[354:55.99]Ah!
[354:57.07]Uh, read.
[355:00.03]Star has reached out end of natural life cycle.
[355:02.43]Now approaching red giant stage.
[355:03.73]Warning.
[355:04.03]Evacuate sun station.
[355:08.15]Approximate time until sun station is destroyed by expanding star.
[355:11.21]Four minutes, nine seconds.
[355:12.11]Approximate time until star's death.
[355:14.27]15 minutes and 39 seconds.
[355:16.87]I need a disk.
[355:30.90]What happened?
[355:31.32]Did the sun station not fire?
[355:34.41]I don't know what comes next, my friends.
[355:36.59]I suppose we must start over, but I'm unsure how to start over.
[355:39.31]Don't I do it?
[355:40.01]Uh...
[356:01.91]Return to Ash Twin first, my friend.
[356:04.29]Perhaps a change of task would help.
[356:06.33]Spire noticed a comet approaching this star system that we'd like to investigate.
[356:12.98]Hi, I heard for you, my friends.
[356:15.62]We all know how hard you both work.
[356:17.42]I can only offer my compassion.
[356:19.82]How are you?
[356:20.56]How is it?
[356:21.45]Idea.
[356:23.24]Give me that.
[356:53.22]Wait.
[356:56.36]Hold on.
[356:56.64]These are all people standing around me.
[356:57.88]These are all people standing around a circle.
[357:01.34]They're all standing around me.
[357:02.48]Is that it?
[357:10.12]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[357:12.57]We're going to die.
[357:25.11]Run, run!
[358:23.05]What did that even do for me?
[358:27.07]I just... They tried to explode the sun with the sun station.
[358:30.31]And then... The comet... They wanted to use the comet instead.
[358:38.56]Okay.
[358:40.52]So, the comet is what's making the sun explode.
[358:42.94]But why?
[358:48.29]How?
[358:50.73]Sun station.
[358:51.37]Done.
[358:59.33]Okay.
[359:36.26]I still don't get what I do.
[359:39.24]What do I do about this?
[359:42.10]Ashtwyn Project.
[359:46.60]All the memories recorded to a storage unit within Ashtwyn.
[359:53.24]There's also this black hole forge in the Hanging City.
[360:07.45]Warp course, the Black Hole Forge.
[360:11.51]There's a huge Nomai city just to the north.
[360:13.29]Alright, I'm going to try this.
[360:18.98]I'm going to do this.
[360:19.48]So this is right above Ryback's campsite.
[360:21.75]I'm going to find Ryback.
[360:22.57]We're going to have to do this tomorrow.
[360:24.19]Let's just crash and die.
[360:56.64]Jeremy, fall into the fun for Son Elbertson.
[361:30.66]Am I going back to Diablo II?
[361:31.82]Yeah.
[361:33.86]On Saturday.
[361:36.12]Saturday is going to be Diablo II.
[361:40.84]Hardcore.
[361:41.20]We're going to try to kill Diablo.
[361:45.20]We need to go to... Rivex Campsite is in the... Where is it?
[361:55.05]The Hollow?
[361:55.43]What is it called?
[361:56.35]Turtle something?
[362:06.43]You act like Diablo's the end, but we know there's an Act 5.
[362:08.91]Yeah.
[362:17.02]I know that, too.
[362:18.36]I have to beat Diablo, though.
[362:22.08]I have to kill Diablo first.
[362:30.98]Tomorrow's Tony Hawk Underground.
[362:36.69]The Xbox 360 hard drive has come in.
[362:42.31]And then Saturday's Diablo II Hardcore.
[362:45.97]And depending on how... Depending on how poorly that goes... We'll probably finish Surah's Wrath, too.
[362:57.93]Bylacter Lich just gave five- tons of fucking money tonight.
[363:01.13]Huge five- five thousand, five thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand bits.
[363:05.34]You guys are fucking going nuts.
[363:08.68]Thanks guys, seriously.
[363:10.64]That's a shitload of money.
[363:11.68]I like to imagine the god of this game is watching just like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[363:25.75]And what, and they're just blowing it up every time?
[363:31.16]They're just... They're doing it for... They're just like, you know, every 20 minutes, see if we can figure out where I am.
[363:35.74]I'm going to find the Eye of the Universe.
[363:38.44]See if you can find me.
[363:39.84]Good luck.
[363:41.12]Alright, we're going to find Ryback.
[363:44.00]But thank you, Phylactery.
[363:45.02]5,000 bits.
[363:48.32]Down here.
[364:03.23]uh he's like in the core but I gotta go yeah I gotta go down that weird uh where is it there's a spot I can sneak in there it is alright let's go down
[364:47.79]Almighty God in chat.
[364:51.51]God.
[364:52.73]Human dev in chat.
[364:55.65]Cool.
[365:00.58]Hey, dude.
[365:01.26]Why did... We can ask questions about the game.
[365:03.92]Why did you give us fingernails?
[365:06.18]What was the point of that?
[365:15.42]He's over there.
[365:16.02]I can't just... How do I get over there reliably?
[365:18.63]How do I get over there reliably without just jumping and dying?
[365:22.95]I could go down here, but how far does that bring me?
[365:32.54]I'm not gonna jump.
[365:34.18]Where does this bring me?
[365:46.29]He's right there.
[365:48.10]Right there!
[365:48.66]Alright, I think I can actually jump from here and land in there.
[365:53.80]No, I don't... Ah!
[366:01.24]Okay.
[366:02.80]It's above Ryback, right?
[366:08.54]So Ryback is there, so the Hanging City is here?
[366:11.48]Like, up here?
[366:22.27]Okay, I gotta turn... What, up here?
[366:27.44]Hold on, turn this way.
[366:36.26]So, what, like... This way?
[366:38.16]Like, up there?
[366:41.05]Or... Right there?
[366:45.13]Alright, but how do I get over there?
[367:00.66]How do I get the bridge?
[367:02.62]Like, go that way?
[367:03.92]Um... I know I'm looking at the funnel, but I... I just... I want to make sure I'm doing this right.
[367:29.67]Alright, and then... What the fuck?
[367:40.13]Okay.
[367:41.05]And then... This way?
[367:59.53]Did you- did you guys just- more huge bits?
[368:02.78]Hayden Klipp fell 10,000 and KXC 50 at the same exact time.
[368:11.88]Have fun space cowboy says Hayden.
[368:13.66]Thank you guys, both of you.
[368:15.54]Oh my god.
[368:20.44]That's a shitload of money.
[368:23.86]Thank you all of you.
[368:26.19]That's too much.
[368:29.11]Hanging City.
[368:31.21]Co-op bits.
[368:32.59]Something like that.
[368:33.39]Oh, well, that was deeply unpleasant.
[368:37.24]I made it this far, though.
[368:38.24]I guess that's the part to focus on and not how I'll eventually have to get back up that path.
[368:42.94]Wow, this place sure is something.
[368:43.90]Looks like the Hanging City is north from here and east is a gravity cannon.
[368:48.23]I definitely want to see that.
[368:49.23]And another thing, I'm detecting oxygen from somewhere below, which is good since I used up a lot of my supply screaming during the trip from the surface.
[368:58.80]As soon as I stop driving, heaving, I'm gonna head further down below so I can refill my tank.
[369:09.17]What's this say?
[369:13.17]Gravity cannon, yep.
[369:13.95]Alright, let's check it out.
[369:17.86]Let's check it out.
[369:20.10]Hanging city.
[369:32.37]I don't want to use any fuel or anything.
[369:39.58]I'm scared to use fuel.
[369:48.56]I'm not going to get hit in the head with that boulder, am I?
[369:55.37]What's over here?
[370:09.44]What the hell?
[370:10.68]Log updated.
[370:13.10]School district.
[370:15.92]Meltwater district.
[370:18.26]High Shrine district.
[370:21.92]Black Hole Forge district.
[370:23.96]I need air.
[370:40.41]Black Hole Forge?
[370:47.29]I need air somewhere.
[370:48.41]Where can I get it?
[370:48.99]There you go.
[370:54.46]Like a town or something?
[370:59.92]This is... Black Hole Forge controls...
[371:22.87]Okay.
[371:26.78]I guess I plugged it in.
[371:30.32]Hold on, there's text here.
[371:52.03]Gastron project requires a powerful, highly advanced warp core.
[371:54.96]How should we obtain it?
[371:55.94]I don't know.
[372:15.84]We could craft a new advanced warp core inspired by the Vessel's warp core.
[372:21.60]Abandoning the vessel's warp core and its casing means losing valuable knowledge.
[372:26.80]This is true, however.
[372:27.56]It's knowledge we have little hope for covering.
[372:29.24]It would be best to relearn, I think.
[372:33.01]I'd very much like to craft such a powerful core.
[372:34.97]More relevantly, I believe the Black Hole Forge crew and I could recreate the basic design.
[372:41.53]What is the safest path for our clan?
[372:44.54]Is the safest path the best one, or are goals worth the risk?
[372:48.66]He says, oh, we've tried for so long to find something that I and others now believe might be possible to find.
[372:54.14]What are they doing here?
[372:57.44]Can I just be honest?
[372:58.60]What the hell are they doing here?
[373:03.76]I can find the eye.
[373:04.72]We can find the eye.
[373:07.02]Why?
[373:07.28]Because we have to.
[373:09.18]Why do you have to?
[373:09.68]Because that's what we do.
[373:12.00]Why?
[373:12.18]Because that's what we do.
[373:14.36]That's what we do.
[373:15.00]That's right.
[373:15.68]Yeah.
[373:23.99]The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don't have the design for such a powerful core or any of the original craft as the Vessel's core.
[373:30.33]No, but the book was an apprentice to Anona, who created the original design, and a black hole forge is an adept at crafting simpler cores.
[373:38.59]I believe I can be of use here.
[373:39.65]The Vessel's warp core was created before my time, but Anona explained many of his designs to me.
[373:48.03]But didn't we... We got it right from the horse's mouth already.
[373:51.65]We talked to one of these people.
[373:55.13]And I was like, what are you doing?
[373:56.72]We just do.
[373:57.18]Okay.
[374:02.02]Why do you want to find the eye?
[374:03.12]Because we do.
[374:03.86]I want to know why.
[374:08.63]I need to know why.
[374:09.95]I can't wait to know why.
[374:11.81]I'm going to be told why.
[374:12.97]And it's going to be a huge, like, wow.
[374:16.34]I can't wait.
[374:24.94]They already told you.
[374:26.34]Yeah, because they just want to know as much as they possibly can.
[374:30.68]They strive for knowledge, right?
[374:32.79]That's all it was?
[374:33.33]They're just curious.
[374:36.85]Have you heard the term, don't fly too close to the sun?
[374:46.29]Seems like they did like a hundred times.
[374:50.57]Require a return to dark bramble flew my father said many good know my parish to there You can retrieve the war for her from the vessel retrieve the war for war from our bramble My mentor and his old mentor once discovered in studying an anglerfish fossil on ember twin I Saw that once
[375:17.28]Studied an angler fish fossil.
[375:18.50]Using that knowledge, we could avoid the angler fish entirely.
[375:21.12]I remember that angler fish fossil we used to play in fossil fish cave when we were children.
[375:30.75]That's fossil... Say that five times fast.
[375:35.06]Fossil fish cave.
[375:35.90]Fossil fish cave.
[375:40.73]what malaria and I have learned is that and that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen the vessel's warp core is broken at best recall those present when the vessel crashed said it was sustained lethal injuries there's no guaranteed reward for the risk perhaps we could still repair it my grandmother my my grandmother told me there was a little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage
[376:10.23]Guys, that's a liar.
[376:13.55]Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we're able to transport it back here.
[376:19.59]Alright.
[376:30.21]How often do I... Who cares?
[376:35.48]Let's keep going up.
[376:36.97]Need more of those, uh... Need more of those... memory sticks?
[376:48.55]For some reason, you can't walk over that.
[376:54.51]I feel strange trying to recreate Anona's warp core without him.
[376:57.95]At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his very young apprentice.
[377:02.79]And for the Black Hole Forge to be in my care and not his.
[377:08.42]This will always feel strange.
[377:09.70]Even though my time with him was short, I miss my old mentor.
[377:16.50]I have the chance to try... To have the chance to try is thrilling.
[377:20.86]But I don't want to disappoint everyone.
[377:23.12]I think I can do this, probably.
[377:24.64]But what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?
[377:29.84]Was I wrong in volunteering to build it?
[377:32.02]I was born in the star system and never saw Anona's warp core with my own three eyes.
[377:35.96]I only know what he taught me.
[377:38.94]They have three eyes.
[377:42.24]What if I've bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?
[377:47.74]Still, all I can give is my best, and as Anona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what's needed.
[377:54.55]I have Clary and Rude in the forge, and I have my clan.
[377:58.39]I'm not alone.
[378:13.71]Another button to turn on?
[378:17.41]Going up?
[378:31.01]We are up very high.
[378:42.63]Motherfucker, there's a distress beacon down there.
[378:44.35]I'll have to figure that out later.
[378:47.09]Alright, we made it to this kind of snowy area.
[378:58.60]Should go that way.
[378:59.26]Wait, wait, is there anything over here?
[379:04.58]Not really.
[379:11.55]Almost out of fuel, which is not good.
[379:15.62]It's running in water.
[379:16.40]Alright, remember where this is.
[379:32.74]This is right south of the North Pole.
[379:35.11]And it's a little river that you can go in.
[379:39.77]Alright, cool.
[379:40.09]A little shortcut.
[379:42.77]I'm going to go back in here, though.
[379:46.65]Wait.
[380:05.94]Okay, you can go all the way back down.
[380:09.69]Alright, let me see.
[380:10.41]Where's that distress beacon?
[380:12.87]Down there?
[380:13.25]There was more stuff I could do over here, wasn't there?
[380:16.43]Forge controls.
[380:19.41]Uh, yeah, let me go up and around.
[380:26.18]Up on, like, the surface.
[380:29.16]Let's go over here.
[380:31.80]There was, like, two other... There were two or three other places to go.
[380:42.32]Can I just go this way, I guess?
[380:44.32]I mean, I'd use the black hole thing.
[380:54.02]Where's the black hole district?
[380:56.56]Wasn't I just in it?
[380:57.10]I'm going this way, whatever.
[381:01.97]I'm just gonna explore.
[381:08.84]Doesn't seem to lead anywhere.
[381:10.22]Where does this go?
[381:12.23]Keep going?
[381:14.19]Hmm, not really.
[381:15.05]Wait, what is over here?
[381:23.59]The sun's gonna blow up any second.
[381:29.52]We have probably three minutes before the thing's gonna start doing the fun music.
[381:39.84]Everybody's dead.
[381:50.79]You're all dead.
[381:51.69]Everyone's dead.
[381:55.00]Everybody's dead.
[381:55.58]Okay.
[382:10.03]They supernovaed themselves.
[382:13.54]Oh, yeah, they cometed themselves.
[382:14.84]I got info to read.
[382:24.85]Yeah, somebody, uh... Somebody touched this thing that they weren't supposed to touch.
[382:30.49]Let's just see what this is.
[382:35.37]Be welcomed in this place.
[382:36.37]This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to the star system to signal from the eye.
[382:42.10]We observed the eye's signal in our travels and followed it here to find its source.
[382:47.76]What we know is this, the source of the signal, which we have chosen to call the eye of the universe, is older than the universe itself.
[382:56.87]The rest we have yet to learn.
[382:59.15]Enter and open your mind to its possibilities.
[383:06.84]What is the eye of the universe?
[383:09.12]Here we go.
[383:09.50]It's gonna tell us.
[383:12.93]The eye is the source of the signal that brought us here.
[383:14.75]I suppose the eye is a more advanced being.
[383:18.05]I suppose.
[383:20.23]The eye is older than this universe, so imagine how much it could teach us.
[383:24.54]Perhaps it is a cosmic library.
[383:33.85]What is the eye's signal?
[383:35.79]Suppose the eye wishes to communicate.
[383:38.35]The signal is the eye's voice.
[383:39.59]It speaks a language we don't yet know.
[383:42.28]Or maybe the signal is the eye's attempt at expressing itself.
[383:46.44]The signal is a call.
[383:47.52]Were we the intended audience?
[383:52.88]From the signal, we were able to determine the eye's approximate age.
[383:58.40]Or lack of age.
[384:03.69]And how can the eye be older than the universe itself?
[384:07.69]Suppose it's a relic from a previous universe.
[384:10.77]The early universe was unimaginably hot and dense.
[384:13.68]If anything existed before, it would have been destroyed.
[384:18.72]Suppose the universe is older than previously assumed.
[384:26.70]Okay.
[384:28.06]Uh... Universe old.
[384:30.39]Eye knowledge.
[384:31.67]Knowledge.
[384:35.85]Good work, guys.
[384:43.07]What is this thing?
[384:49.66]Go up a little further.
[385:08.51]On something What do you have to say I no longer believe as I did as a child on ember twin that the eye of the universe Wishes to harm us, but it may not want to be found either What else do you have to say terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that circumstance I
[385:34.93]We saw her earlier.
[385:36.13]This wouldn't be so bad.
[385:38.37]In fact, the eye may not have wishes at all.
[385:39.91]We have no evidence supporting this.
[386:08.23]It didn't call out to chat.
[386:09.68]It didn't call out to you guys.
[386:11.10]No, sorry.
[386:13.72]It wasn't calling to you.
[386:18.24]Alright, have we learned most of what we've learned so far?
[386:21.11]Have we learned everything we need to know here?
[386:22.65]Hey, asshole with the eye.
[386:39.68]Okay.
[386:46.05]Let's go back.
[386:50.77]I think I've read most of the things I can read here.
[386:53.35]I missed.
[386:54.77]Please grab the ledge.
[386:55.97]Grab... I'm going in the fucking black hole.
[386:58.43]I'm going in the black hole.
[386:59.41]I'm going in the fucking black hole.
[387:00.45]I tried to skip it.
[387:01.15]I just wanted to go... I wanted to go and get out and...
[387:21.36]Wait.
[387:21.54]What the hell are you doing out here?
[387:29.21]Wait.
[387:29.99]What the hell are you doing out here?
[387:36.80]This is a scripted part of the movie.
[387:38.44]Why are you doing this?
[387:47.95]Hanging city.
[387:49.39]The vessel.
[387:50.83]Ooh.
[387:52.58]The vessel's warp core broke when the ship crashed in dark bramble.
[388:02.47]The vessel.
[388:10.19]We almost completed this one.
[388:11.25]Escape Pod 2.
[388:14.29]Warp Corp broke when the ship crashed in Dark Bramble.
[388:17.50]To Dark Bramble we go.
[388:24.63]Sun's about to blow up, but, you know.
[388:40.81]This thing's about to blow.
[388:53.38]I want to see the supernova.
[388:54.42]It's going to take too long.
[388:55.14]No, let's go.
[389:12.66]We did learn a lot.
[389:20.81]I have to get into that Ash Twin database thing.
[389:24.95]I have the key.
[389:27.21]I have the coordinates for the Eye of the Universe.
[389:29.86]What do I do with them?
[389:30.58]I have no idea.
[389:44.50]Go to the vessel.
[389:45.02]It did just open up.
[389:47.58]Vessel.
[389:47.72]The vessel.
[389:47.94]So we need to go to Dark Bramble and find this vessel.
[390:19.03]Anglerfish.
[390:28.57]No mind learned how to evade anglerfish by studying an anglerfish fossil they found on Ember Twin.
[390:34.15]Let's go for it.
[390:44.52]Dark Bramble.
[390:56.03]It's been a while since I've been here, actually.
[391:07.38]It's been probably seven or eight in-game hours since I've been here.
[391:29.41]Ark Bramble.
[391:34.49]And we're looking for a vessel?
[391:46.48]A ship.
[391:51.30]Ship, ship, ship.
[391:53.98]Some kind of ship.
[392:00.75]I'm going to say distress beacon.
[392:12.90]Yep.
[392:14.40]Yep.
[392:16.95]Yep.
[392:17.71]Yep.
[392:34.28]There it is.
[392:43.24]Good impression of Storage Wars.
[392:44.98]No, that would be a little different.
[392:47.12]That would be... Yep!
[392:52.36]You good?
[392:57.30]What the fuck is that?
[393:17.16]It's a signal.
[393:35.44]There it is.
[393:36.38]Alright, how do I get in there reliably?
[393:45.01]Right there?
[393:45.39]There it is.
[393:47.05]Alright, get in.
[393:47.49]Found the ship.
[393:56.96]Alright, fuck it.
[393:57.42]Let's get in there.
[393:58.90]Alright, just get out.
[394:03.81]I can swim, right?
[394:04.47]I'm good.
[394:22.03]Our escape pod crashed as we tried to flee this place, destroying our movement and communication capabilities in the process.
[394:30.34]We've held out as long as we could here, but this pod's supply of breathable air is nearly depleted, and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently.
[394:37.78]The best chance at survival is to return to the vessel to either repair the damage or more probably wait rescue.
[394:46.38]Tekka, is the message finished?
[394:47.92]The vessel's beacon is already growing fainter.
[394:51.26]It'll be gone in a matter of hours.
[394:52.60]We need to leave here.
[394:53.42]Isn't this... This is not the vessel?
[395:01.92]Alright, skip a three.
[395:13.44]This shit ain't the vessel.
[395:17.81]Well, maybe I'll get some info on where the hell it is.
[395:24.34]escape pod 3, vessel has been mortally injured, emergency sequence activated, awaiting departure from vessel now launching escape pod 3 multiple collisions have altered pod's trajectory, significant damage to pod detected navigation error, life support error, propulsion error
[395:47.68]Scanning external environment.
[395:49.76]Scan complete.
[395:50.45]Gravity not detected.
[395:51.35]Breathable air not detected.
[395:52.45]Multiple lifeforms detected.
[395:54.05]Do not exit pod.
[395:58.82]I know what the vessel is.
[395:59.60]Okay.
[396:01.28]The vessel is the thing that explodes when you wake up.
[396:14.45]This is a new problem.
[396:15.19]Our equipment is detecting two distinct beacons from the vessel.
[396:20.63]But it's impossible for the vessel to be in two different locations at the same time.
[396:26.50]I agree, but the beacons are exactly identical to each other.
[396:29.12]Perhaps if I had more time.
[396:31.46]We're nearly out of time already, Din.
[396:33.26]The vessel's beacon is quickly fading.
[396:34.68]Soon it will be gone and we will be lost.
[396:37.53]We will follow the beacon whose source is nearest to us.
[396:41.77]Suppose that beacon is false.
[396:44.15]We likely don't have enough air to reach the farther of the two beacons, then.
[396:47.49]The decision is made for us.
[396:50.08]We'll leave a trail of lights as we go.
[396:51.98]There's still a chance someone could hear our escape pod's distress signal.
[396:55.26]Okay.
[397:01.30]Don't open this yet.
[397:01.92]I don't want to read this.
[397:03.90]Emergency escape hatch.
[397:11.60]Wait.
[397:12.85]The light.
[397:16.55]No, we gotta go.
[397:17.29]We gotta follow these lights.
[397:18.49]Give me the ship.
[397:27.08]Give me the ship.
[397:38.72]Okay.
[397:40.80]Follow the lights going that way.
[397:43.50]Dump this into the computer.
[397:46.03]Escape pod 3.
[397:47.63]Escape pod 3 survivors.
[397:58.84]Another beacon?
[397:59.80]Didn't it say there was another beacon?
[398:15.58]Wait a minute.
[398:16.28]That's... What is this?
[398:21.24]Is this... Is this a ship?
[398:25.93]Holy fuck.
[398:27.77]They're all dead.
[398:29.18]Okay, hold on.
[398:29.72]What are they... What are they doing over here?
[398:48.31]Ready who come here searching for us?
[398:49.66]We followed one of the two beacons from the vessel to this place, but now can go no further.
[398:57.44]It's almost too faint to hear now, but the vessel's beacon is still faintly emitting from within this thorny seed.
[399:04.41]Yet the opening is too small for even a single nomai to fit through it, so our escape pod couldn't have flown through here.
[399:09.55]I know what to do.
[399:14.15]I don't understand how this could be possible, but this gruesome place seems able to manipulate space itself.
[399:18.17]Maybe this was our undoing.
[399:21.81]So to be close to the location of the vessel and still go so far is difficult.
[399:26.94]Worse, the vessel's beacon is dying.
[399:29.28]Soon, we'll be unable to hear it.
[399:32.33]There's nothing we can do now but try to perhaps find a way inside or at least attempt to comprehend why this happened.
[399:37.43]My dearest hope is that the other escape pods were able to reach relatives.
[399:42.66]It's the fucking thing that's on the home planet.
[399:59.62]That's the thing that's on the home planet.
[400:00.86]The vessel is the thing on the home planet.
[400:05.16]Right?
[400:06.34]BoxBox, thanks for the raid.
[400:07.70]I missed it, sorry.
[400:09.38]Thank you, BoxBox, for the huge raid.
[400:10.76]Welcome, everybody.
[400:12.46]We are currently in the second half of... I almost said keep talking and nobody explodes.
[400:18.65]But... That's kind of... You could describe this as well.
[400:23.93]Outer Wilds.
[400:28.79]Okay.
[400:28.95]Okay.
[400:30.46]Here we go.
[400:31.30]I know what to do.
[400:33.74]Let's do it.
[400:39.02]Hey, stop.
[400:40.34]Way to ruin my immersion.
[400:48.36]Hold on.
[400:49.40]Do it again.
[401:03.00]Alright.
[401:03.96]That's where it is.
[401:05.96]Who's gonna follow the thing?
[401:06.80]Alright, we don't need anything else here.
[401:08.12]Go back in the ship.
[401:08.68]Let's get the hell out of here.
[401:09.76]Follow that beacon.
[401:18.73]Follow that beacon.
[401:30.17]It's red.
[401:55.59]duplicate signal it's in the red oh hi guys
[402:32.77]Okay.
[402:36.26]Go, go, go!
[402:39.08]Faster!
[402:41.84]Will he smash his head on something?
[402:43.08]Nope, I'm dead.
[403:02.79]So, two of them show up.
[403:04.89]I'm not sure how... Do we have to get by them?
[403:12.36]Is there a way I can kill them or something?
[403:19.73]I learned a lot.
[403:29.87]You turn them into fossils.
[403:31.21]They turn into fossils, but how?
[403:34.08]Okay.
[403:48.31]Know my grave.
[403:50.35]Survivors from escape pod 3 followed one of the two vessel beacons to a small dark bramble seed where they could go no further.
[403:56.18]They could hear the vessel's beacon from... I'm sorry.
[403:59.57]Stupid fucking mic.
[404:01.19]The opening was too small.
[404:02.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[404:27.95]Studying an anglerfish fossil they found on Ember Twin.
[404:31.77]Shit.
[404:43.46]Ah!
[404:45.38]I gotta go to the Ember Twin thing to find out how to evade them.
[404:51.22]Is it like just... Is it light?
[404:53.27]Ugh.
[405:10.06]There's an anglerfish fossil on Ember Twin.
[405:13.16]Let's go to Ember Twin and find it.
[405:27.91]Hello?
[405:49.18]Ember Twin, let's go.
[405:49.95]There's a fossil of one of these on Ember Twin.
[405:52.53]Hopefully it's on the surface.
[406:14.28]Wait, didn't I?
[406:14.94]No, I've seen it.
[406:15.62]It's in that cave.
[406:17.64]How do I get in that cave?
[406:19.04]I never found out.
[406:20.00]Is there a way to drop down?
[406:21.78]There's a way to drop.
[406:24.98]I think I can drop somewhere.
[406:45.09]I just don't remember.
[406:46.22]I know it's in that cave system.
[406:50.36]I gotta go down there and look.
[406:51.56]But I can't get there from there.
[406:53.00]It's over here.
[406:55.58]Above the door where the cannon is.
[407:11.75]Where is this?
[407:17.17]There's the cannon.
[407:24.03]Here it is.
[407:31.19]Alright.
[407:33.47]So, theoretically here... Let's get out of this thing.
[407:45.29]here, right?
[407:47.15]No, no, no, no.
[407:47.63]Where is it?
[407:48.87]It's, like, in the rocks up here?
[407:51.11]Why is it to be so fucking dark?
[407:55.64]Why is it to be so dark?
[407:56.94]Unbelievable.
[407:57.92]Is this a space game?
[407:58.90]Okay.
[408:04.58]This is where it is.
[408:10.73]But not here.
[408:14.03]What the fuck?
[408:16.49]Excuse me?
[408:17.67]I was holding A. Okay.
[408:30.24]Now how do I get there from here?
[408:31.40]There's gotta be a way.
[408:36.86]Wait, I- I didn't even touch this shit.
[408:39.00]I didn't even touch this stuff, did I?
[408:44.49]Anglerfish- Whoa!
[408:51.72]Huh?
[409:15.99]Anglerfish observation tarot deck.
[409:19.91]Yeah.
[409:22.27]No, wait.
[409:26.21]Very old specimen.
[409:27.09]We might learn if we could examine it.
[409:30.24]Yeah, no, I've already looked in here.
[409:36.22]I need to get in the observation deck.
[409:38.82]I want to get in the room.
[409:39.68]I need to get inside of there.
[409:49.78]Lately, this hole is too small for it to have fit through.
[409:51.70]There's another entrance to this cave.
[409:53.72]If there is, Coleus and I will find it.
[409:55.42]We can't leave Valleyville.
[409:56.40]Of course there is.
[409:59.22]Why can't there ever be just a front door in this game?
[410:02.77]Every door is blocked.
[410:03.57]You have to go in a back cave door.
[410:05.65]I need to find a way inside quickly, because when I returned here, there was children playing in the specimens.
[410:22.77]There's another way in.
[410:23.65]Whatever.
[410:23.95]Gotta go.
[410:35.28]Here comes the sand.
[410:36.50]That went way too fast!
[410:39.23]Okay.
[410:41.65]What's this one?
[410:43.99]Stepping Stone District.
[410:47.65]Oh my god, there's so much shit here.
[410:49.73]Turn them all on.
[410:52.94]High Energy Lab Trailhead.
[410:54.10]What's this one?
[410:55.16]High Shrine District.
[410:58.66]Over there?
[411:02.90]Let's do one at a time here.
[411:05.02]Can you give me, like, a three second window before it becomes available to touch again?
[411:13.33]What is all this shit?
[411:30.32]I'm running out of time.
[411:40.33]We're meeting in the fossil fish cave to play the game.
[411:44.15]If you're too big to climb through the angler fish overlook hole, you'll have to go the long way, but it isn't far.
[411:52.44]Go to the stepping stone cave and then up and into the fossil fish cave.
[412:00.79]I tried to get to the fossil fish through the stepping stone cave, but I couldn't find the entrance.
[412:05.05]Where is it?
[412:08.23]Remember to feed the fossil fish first.
[412:11.22]If you go to the anglerfish overlook and throw a light into his mouth, he'll show you the way.
[412:15.66]What?
[412:17.24]Target can't fit through the anglerfish overlook hole anymore because he grew bigger.
[412:20.08]He's taller than Levi now.
[412:23.95]Who cares?
[412:25.17]I'm still the tallest.
[412:29.15]I'm going to do one final break.
[412:31.99]I'm going to take Otto out and pee.
[412:34.44]And we'll do our last break.
[412:35.44]And hopefully I can get this game done in the next hour or so.
[412:37.30]I'll be right back.
[417:15.95]What are you guys fighting?
[417:16.59]Why are you guys fighting?
[417:20.21]Why is everybody fighting?
[417:21.19]Hey, no food fights!
[417:31.62]No food fights, please.
[417:32.76]Alright.
[417:36.96]Stepping Stone Cave.
[417:39.92]The entrance is... We have to feed the fossil fish.
[417:45.56]Throw a light into his mouth.
[417:53.54]Stepping stone cave.
[417:54.70]Okay, well, the sand is filling up.
[418:01.91]I gotta... I gotta... What is this?
[418:07.65]Stepping stone cave.
[418:14.25]I keep having these Eureka reveal moments in my brain.
[418:18.25]And... I say them as I see them.
[418:23.77]Although, I didn't put the light down.
[418:26.89]Wait, did I?
[418:29.51]Shit.
[418:35.59]Is it still there?
[418:36.13]Alright, thank god.
[418:40.84]Thank god my idiot brain actually just left it there.
[418:49.60]Why were children doing this?
[418:51.58]Why were children doing this?
[418:52.64]Can I land on that?
[419:05.73]Sand.
[419:06.17]Sand.
[419:07.31]Wait.
[419:20.13]Am I supposed to use the sand?
[419:22.01]How much higher can I go?
[419:25.70]That's not correct.
[419:31.49]That's not correct.
[419:32.81]That's not correct.
[419:33.61]It's okay, it's just sand.
[420:03.86]How do I get up here?
[420:05.98]What the fuck?
[420:08.75]Do I just... I mean, the light... He has the light going your way.
[420:14.13]The stairs.
[420:16.01]I just was on the stairs.
[420:17.23]Wasn't I just on them?
[420:24.50]Oh, I was following the scout thing.
[420:33.39]Okay, over there.
[420:34.63]I only have three minutes of air.
[420:39.25]What the hell is all this?
[420:41.19]Are we playing the fossil fish game tonight?
[420:44.07]I fed the fossil fish a new lantern.
[420:45.63]If you go to the stepping stone cave, the entrance to the fossil fish cave is easy to see now.
[420:50.57]Gratitude.
[420:51.67]Solinum.
[420:52.11]It's good to see you're small enough to climb in through the hole at the angler fish overlook.
[420:58.52]I'm still small enough.
[421:00.64]You won't be for long.
[421:01.42]Mom and dad are tall, so you and I will be tall too.
[421:07.01]Must be nice.
[421:15.92]I just keep going?
[421:21.64]Keep going?
[421:22.84]Follow the stairs?
[421:26.11]No, this is not right.
[421:36.84]That's not right.
[421:38.86]Stepping stone cave.
[421:43.38]I was... I think it's over.
[421:44.42]Uh, alright.
[421:51.35]We're like filled up with sand at this point.
[421:56.51]Do I have time to do it?
[422:00.66]Do I actually have time to do it?
[422:02.82]I have time.
[422:03.32]Okay, well, what is it?
[422:04.91]Up here?
[422:05.21]I don't remember where the door is.
[422:07.15]Every single door here, it's all the same.
[422:08.93]It's blending together in my brain.
[422:10.25]It's all the same architecture.
[422:12.15]Where is it?
[422:12.49]It's right there?
[422:17.67]This is broken.
[422:19.05]There, it's in here.
[422:19.55]I don't have any oxygen either.
[422:27.28]I'm dead.
[422:40.86]I have to die.
[422:43.34]Well, now I'm going to go here exactly immediately.
[422:45.77]Did I get it?
[422:50.67]No.
[422:56.49]I'm not going to do this.
[423:02.55]I'm just so disoriented down here.
[423:05.96]The cave is just like the same color on either side and it's like it's just everything melts together in the same pot of same exact image in my brain.
[423:13.91]I have this one light in the middle and like the same color on either side of my brain.
[423:22.97]Right there.
[423:27.77]Oh.
[423:31.88]Quickly!
[423:33.39]Quickly, learn the secret!
[423:34.57]Learn the secret!
[423:35.49]Quickly!
[423:38.74]Whoever was it when we ended last time is the anglerfish.
[423:42.78]Pickle, rule change.
[423:44.36]The anglerfish now has to wear a blindfold.
[423:49.76]The rest of us line up against one wall.
[423:52.61]When the anglerfish says go, the little fish sneak across to the other side.
[423:58.31]If the anglerfish catches you, you're eaten.
[424:01.23]Last little fish to be caught is the new anglerfish.
[424:04.59]The old anglerfish gives the new anglerfish the blindfold and becomes a little fish.
[424:08.83]Why are we changing it?
[424:09.77]It's too hard if you can't see anything.
[424:13.27]Aunt Pie says real anglerfish are blind, but you have to wear a blindfold.
[424:17.87]The rules stands.
[424:20.71]It's okay if younger kids don't wear the blindfold when they're at it.
[424:24.35]The rest of us will still wear it for scientific accuracy and make the game even... Alright, so they're blind.
[424:29.29]So... Uh, so what, just to go quietly?
[424:39.35]Alright, is there anything... While I'm still frozen here, is there any... Are those kids dead?
[424:48.71]Holy shit.
[424:49.18]Okay, what's up?
[424:49.74]Something up here.
[424:56.69]I made it.
[424:56.99]Oh, come on.
[424:59.19]Really?
[424:59.47]It's okay.
[425:02.09]I learned what I wanted to learn.
[425:11.55]Anglerfish are blind.
[425:14.60]So, I'm assuming I just have to be very quiet when they show up.
[425:32.20]so we'll just just turn off the engine just don't move like if they're blind then they can hear so they they're gonna I just have to just not move don't make any sounds when they're around okay
[426:00.32]So let's test that hypothesis.
[426:04.04]And let's head back to the bramble.
[426:08.63]To that ship.
[426:10.11]To that beacon.
[426:11.13]See if we can kind of coast slowly by them.
[426:36.20]I'm going to go into the sun if I keep this trajectory.
[427:02.61]Alright, take up the...
[427:05.30]Stress beacon, escape pod 3.
[427:06.78]And then we go that direction.
[427:11.24]Alright, this should be... I gotta be quiet.
[427:15.29]How do I be quiet in this thing?
[427:17.01]It's like a big ship with fire in it.
[427:19.05]How do I be quiet?
[427:38.42]I wonder if I just don't move?
[427:40.99]But then how do I kind of turn the ship?
[427:48.23]I wonder what's the range of them being able to see or hear me. ...
[428:22.22]Is it just the red one?
[428:23.20]Should I just go towards the red one?
[428:24.78]That's just it, right?
[428:25.60]I don't have to do this whole thing all over again, do I?
[428:57.57]Alright.
[428:58.37]Somebody hears me.
[429:00.43]I'm not moving.
[429:03.15]Where is he?
[429:03.41]To the left?
[429:05.52]Okay, he's right next to me.
[429:09.38]Is there one right next to me to the right?
[429:10.52]Alright, there he is.
[429:11.97]Can I move?
[429:14.37]Oh my god, I don't know the timing.
[429:15.75]He was still next to me.
[429:29.88]I thought he was past me.
[429:39.71]I think if the booster is low enough for one bar, they won't hear you.
[429:43.72]Can I look around?
[429:44.62]Hold on, let me... I could, like, get out.
[429:49.18]Hold on.
[429:52.74]This took me, like, five or six tries, I believe.
[429:55.43]I don't know.
[429:58.59]I'm just trying to figure it out. ...
[430:24.69]This is where I gave up.
[430:30.01]Really?
[430:30.71]Damn.
[430:48.39]I feel like I want to go fast, though.
[430:50.51]Like, tiptoeing around.
[430:51.61]Okay, that one... When you go in the red dot, and there's two of them, and they go, Hey!
[430:57.47]Don't move there, right?
[430:58.32]But I feel like if I... The slower I am, I feel like I'd rather just go in quicker.
[431:04.92]And... And!
[431:05.88]I'm looking at chat and talking, and I'm gonna crash into this, and we're gonna have to do the whole fucking thing over again.
[431:23.68]Velocity joke.
[431:36.49]Let's be supportive for a change.
[431:37.81]Jerma, you got this.
[431:38.61]Don't fuck it up.
[431:39.29]That's not really supportive.
[431:42.26]That's more like putting pressure on me.
[431:46.32]You should have said, hey, you got this.
[431:47.70]No, not don't fuck it up.
[432:08.66]I wonder where it is.
[432:27.25]I'm just gonna go fast.
[432:36.18]The faster I went last time, I got through two of them.
[432:41.50]Like, just go.
[432:42.06]The last two times I've made it through here, I've gone fast.
[432:57.43]Is there a way to... How do I look?
[432:58.57]Do I have to unbuckle?
[433:04.48]See?
[433:04.72]Like, I just got the fuck in here.
[433:13.16]And now is when I just don't fucking move.
[433:18.98]Um, but... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[433:21.44]Hold on a second.
[433:23.00]So... How do I... I'm gonna bump into his... His tendril.
[433:29.50]I'm gonna touch him.
[433:35.16]I'm gonna touch him.
[433:40.10]You can direct it.
[433:40.94]Wait, I have to go.
[433:42.76]Don't boost.
[433:44.51]I can move.
[433:45.09]I'm going to touch him.
[433:48.43]I'm going to touch him.
[433:49.07]Oh.
[434:18.00]How did I not touch him?
[434:20.38]I'm shocked.
[434:25.04]I can't believe I didn't touch him.
[434:26.02]Okay.
[434:30.63]Almost there.
[434:33.81]Okay.
[434:49.33]floor it.
[434:50.31]I'm not gonna floor it.
[434:53.87]Wait.
[434:54.65]Okay, what is it?
[434:56.70]Is it another thing to go in?
[434:57.84]Is it another bramble?
[434:58.76]Or is it a vessel?
[434:59.58]Is it the vessel?
[435:00.30]I can't see what that is.
[435:09.83]What is that?
[435:10.35]Someone just flew by me.
[435:20.35]What is this?
[435:28.57]I'm not gonna floor it.
[435:29.59]I'm not gonna floor it.
[435:30.45]No flooring it.
[435:34.85]It's a bunch of eggs.
[435:36.59]Am I the sperm?
[435:38.01]I'm the sperm.
[435:40.41]I knew it.
[435:41.89]This is about making a baby.
[435:43.64]The baby's eyes are gonna open.
[435:44.80]It's gonna be a baby.
[435:59.77]Okay, so what is this?
[436:02.85]What am I doing with this?
[436:03.93]Am I going to crash into this?
[436:27.30]Oops.
[436:27.52]What is this?
[437:03.27]Eggs?
[437:03.87]Did I pass something?
[437:05.59]Hold on.
[437:06.45]Do I have a beacon?
[437:17.04]I can't break them.
[437:35.87]He didn't scout the vessel.
[437:50.58]Pick a hole and go, Omega lul.
[438:12.81]People saying I missed a person here?
[438:20.88]I don't see anything.
[438:26.06]That's really weird, whatever it is.
[438:27.24]It's like a DNA strand.
[438:31.44]So where the vessel is...
[438:37.63]I'm just gonna pick a hole.
[438:39.07]Wait, what are you talking about?
[438:47.83]What are you guys talking about?
[438:52.40]I don't have the scout anywhere.
[438:56.82]Guys, I shot the scout at that.
[439:00.84]That's not... I shot the scout onto this.
[439:05.88]That's... I didn't do the thing I did before.
[439:10.39]The scout... I didn't have the scout.
[439:11.63]I didn't do the thing.
[439:12.51]I didn't go back and shoot it through the thing.
[439:13.69]Shoot it at a hole now.
[439:18.77]Just one of these fucking things.
[439:19.79]Just shoot it into one of these.
[439:27.42]I think I just hit... I think I just hit... I think I just hit a fish.
[439:30.80]Ha ha ha ha!
[439:37.84]Wake up if you weren't awake already.
[439:39.58]What about right here?
[439:55.15]Not on that one.
[440:07.43]not that one so what I I had to have gone back to where they all were dead and shot it in there to be able to find where the vessel is
[440:34.40]I can still find it.
[440:35.84]I mean, good luck.
[440:36.80]I have to just pick the random one that's correct.
[440:38.91]I'm gonna hit this.
[440:59.13]Damn it.
[441:00.55]So this was the fake signal.
[441:03.13]Didn't they say there was two signals?
[441:15.76]I think I just have to die then, don't I?
[441:17.41]I have to just floor it and just die.
[441:19.81]I don't know.
[441:22.17]I have no idea which one's the right one.
[441:27.23]There's, like, this... Like, a dozen of these, aren't there?
[441:29.63]Let's have to leave.
[441:34.83]There's no distress beacon in here.
[441:40.44]I'm just gonna go in one.
[441:42.10]Fuck it, whatever.
[441:43.00]I don't have the signal.
[441:51.90]Like, I have to go get the signal.
[441:54.50]And shoot it into the thing so I know where it is.
[442:04.28]uh I might be screwed here yeah I should have done that first I just for some reason I thought because I don't know I thought I listened to one guy in chat that said just fly to the red light you're fine do it again you can't even get me
[442:35.01]Somebody said, you don't have to do that.
[442:36.93]Just fly to the red light.
[442:37.95]And I was like, oh, okay.
[442:38.89]You must know what you're talking about.
[443:04.89]Alright.
[443:05.51]Go to escape pod 3.
[443:07.03]Shoot into the thing.
[443:08.58]Go follow the beacon.
[443:10.78]Follow the scout.
[443:24.99]That's where I need to go.
[443:25.77]Alright.
[443:33.56]Now it's time for hard mode.
[443:41.88]Oh no.
[443:53.72]Let's go!
[444:14.40]Go to the grave, fire the thing in, sneak past all the guards, and follow the right beacon.
[444:23.13]Should have done that.
[444:23.76]I was gonna do that, too.
[444:24.94]I was going to.
[444:27.52]I'm actually glad it's an emote only.
[444:29.62]So I can't get fake advice.
[444:47.31]I wonder what, seriously, the percentage of actual, real advice is in Twitch chats.
[444:55.99]Or if people are just saying, just typing random shit.
[444:57.86]They're just like, I don't fucking know.
[444:59.28]I'm just going to see if I can get them to do this.
[445:07.68]Hey, yeah, dude.
[445:09.46]You press A three times when you get to the grave.
[445:12.89]Is he going to do that?
[445:13.61]And they hear this.
[445:16.97]And they're like, oh my god, what a fucking idiot.
[445:19.50]Alright, let's go fast.
[445:28.17]I know everyone hates this and so do I, but I have to go fast.
[445:30.35]I have to.
[445:41.34]Grave.
[445:41.76]Am I stuck?
[446:12.19]I thought that was a fish.
[446:13.19]It's just a log.
[446:16.03]It's just a strange looking log.
[446:17.85]Okay, here we go.
[446:18.35]Is that a fish or is that a log?
[446:45.62]Okay, here we go.
[446:47.92]There it is.
[446:52.60]Hire the scout in and then follow their lights.
[447:02.51]Oh my god, you're gonna make me fucking throw up.
[447:06.30]What are you... I...
[447:29.87]It won't go in?
[447:30.37]It won't, this shit won't.
[447:55.32]All of the lights What?
[448:29.66]No, I didn't wait No, but No, I just have to go to the no, I already have it it's already there Why why did it save all the lights?
[448:42.82]Oh, no, that was we did that already.
[448:44.42]Okay.
[448:44.64]Yeah.
[448:44.86]Yeah.
[448:45.00]Yeah.
[448:45.26]Yeah That was like that.
[448:46.20]I did it in reverse.
[448:47.74]Go look at signal.
[448:48.38]Let's go
[449:01.44]Here we go.
[449:02.28]Yes, get me in.
[449:03.12]Get out of the... Okay, can we get like the Star Trek ship to get the fuck out of my way?
[449:07.25]Okay.
[449:20.03]It's not that way.
[449:21.47]It's down there.
[449:24.66]I can bump this, right?
[449:26.36]That's very clear that I'm not gonna bump this shit.
[449:33.67]No, alright.
[449:36.21]There's the scout.
[449:43.08]Wait, who is ever a duplicate scout?
[450:08.37]Is this still good?
[450:11.15]We're good, right?
[450:12.39]I'm going so slow, but I can't press a button.
[450:31.76]There are the frog eggs.
[450:32.90]There are all the new tadpoles that are going to come out.
[450:35.10]That's fine.
[450:35.84]We just go past it.
[450:55.94]Is it safe to use thrusters right now?
[451:00.92]Is it safe to use thrusters?
[451:03.35]No.
[451:04.71]I can hear somebody.
[451:12.83]I just did it a little bit.
[451:22.88]Okay, don't do it anymore.
[451:30.48]Sorry, did I floor it?
[451:31.48]Did I floor it?
[451:33.34]Did I floor it?
[451:52.32]Alright, so we've got 600 meters and we're almost there.
[451:54.10]This is the vessel.
[452:03.74]Are those things still here?
[452:27.51]What do I do?
[452:37.62]Get out and fly in it with my body?
[452:45.81]Is there a broken entrance or something?
[452:47.61]Is there a window broken like over here?
[452:55.25]Okay.
[452:59.10]How do I get in here?
[453:01.35]Entrance over here?
[453:01.97]This looks like torn up.
[453:05.91]Can I go in there?
[453:11.82]Underneath?
[453:15.10]What the fuck is this door?
[453:16.26]This is just like underneath.
[453:17.66]Underneath.
[453:18.08]Dude.
[453:28.50]What kind of fucked up ship do you fly here?
[453:37.96]What is this fucking thing?
[453:39.10]This is a lawnmower.
[453:40.52]This is not even a ship.
[453:41.68]How do I get in here?
[453:51.08]You fucking weed-whacker ship.
[453:52.98]Where do I go?
[454:11.41]Take it off emote only, give me the answer, I don't care.
[454:23.62]Get out of this thing before it explodes.
[454:32.94]No, what?
[454:35.54]It's at the very top.
[454:49.63]Oh my god, this is so disorienting.
[454:51.67]I want to throw up.
[454:59.05]Right here.
[454:59.52]This gameplay makes me want to puke.
[455:12.12]In fact, I probably should go puke.
[455:17.99]Wait, it's not right here?
[455:19.07]There's a giant hole right here.
[455:21.93]Oh, you dickhead game.
[455:54.49]It was this the whole time?
[455:55.61]There's no entrance here.
[455:57.67]There's nothing here to go in.
[456:01.98]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[456:03.10]It's that white-ass background.
[456:22.27]I was gonna go there first, but I was like, oh no, there's nothing there.
[456:24.69]Alright, what do you got in here?
[456:37.38]What can I read in here?
[456:38.18]Turn this on?
[456:52.78]power up this thing?
[456:53.72]Alright, we're going to put power somewhere.
[456:57.40]I don't know what that did.
[457:04.13]I guess I don't know.
[457:17.99]I'm going to go travel up here.
[457:23.62]Although, there's a button to press over there, but I'm not going to press it yet.
[457:26.40]There's probably info up here.
[457:27.96]There is.
[457:35.58]Why can't I just chew on fucking, like, gravity gum like they do in Mars attacks?
[457:40.31]This is Escal's vessel.
[457:41.77]Something went badly wrong during our warp, and our vessel is mortally wounded.
[457:46.03]We needed help as quickly as possible.
[457:49.77]Our vessel appears to have... has it fused with the local environment somehow.
[457:56.31]Well, you're all dead.
[457:56.85]Is this broken?
[457:57.15]Can anyone hear me?
[457:57.63]Hello?
[457:57.79]Our vessel's dying!
[457:58.33]Sorry, I only have 20 minutes to figure this out.
[458:01.77]Okay.
[458:28.82]If any Nomai clans invested can hear this message.
[458:39.88]It's clear the universe is dying.
[458:43.15]There are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now.
[458:46.93]So my clan and I believe the best option is for all our clans to stay together.
[458:52.99]If you can reach the glooming galaxy, we found that Black Rock's suns are fairly stable and life in this star system is thriving.
[459:02.15]We live in relative safety.
[459:06.77]Well, if you prefer to continue exploring alone, know you will be on your own.
[459:13.78]Hannah, we're making our way to you.
[459:15.18]There's a lot of writing on this one.
[459:18.37]They took the whole board.
[459:20.03]It's good to hear from you, Romy.
[459:21.59]We'll watch your vessel.
[459:23.45]We'll watch for your vessel.
[459:26.79]Has anyone heard from Neem?
[459:27.91]His clan was on its way to our vessel, but they never arrived, and he hasn't sent any messages.
[459:32.20]I'm beginning to worry.
[459:35.84]That is unsettling.
[459:36.66]It reminds me of that old myth my grandfather used to tell, the disappearance of Eskel.
[459:44.67]I remember hearing that story as a child.
[459:48.13]One day, Eskall's vessel simply stopped responding.
[459:50.49]The other clans searched and searched but found no trace.
[459:52.73]It was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence.
[459:55.15]That's no myth, friends.
[459:58.53]Eskall's clan existed and their story was real.
[460:02.93]What a curious event to have passed into myth.
[460:04.79]Our ancestors were told that story when they were young.
[460:08.52]Are you sure it's true?
[460:15.88]Fucking goddamn gravity, man.
[460:17.48]I swear to God.
[460:19.13]It was a very long time ago, but yes, my clan's ancestors searched for Eskow's clan for a long time.
[460:25.01]But in the end, none of them were... None of them were ever seen again.
[460:40.84]I hope you aren't comparing Eskow's story to my clan's vessel.
[460:45.92]Alright, wrap it up, guys.
[460:47.50]Ain't got much more board space.
[460:52.26]Time to wrap it up.
[460:54.92]Me, my friend, we feared you were gone.
[460:56.70]People are gonna start writing on the edge like a little bit like, oh fuck, I can't fit it.
[461:05.04]Not yet, we aren't, but nearly.
[461:06.32]We found trouble during our warp.
[461:08.50]See, blame this idiot that took this much space.
[461:12.42]Right?
[461:13.09]Like two or three people took up way too much space here.
[461:18.16]We found trouble during our warp.
[461:19.34]The triple suns of the bright spark star system exploded.
[461:22.06]And it was only a lucky coincidence.
[461:26.22]We weren't caught in the blast.
[461:27.52]We'll meet you soon.
[461:30.48]I'm relieved your clan is safe, Neem.
[461:32.05]It's good to hear your words.
[461:35.27]Any vessels nearby, remember to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars.
[461:41.95]Blame the guy with the big, bald-ass handwriting.
[461:45.33]You didn't have to have a board this big.
[461:48.16]okay I press the button warp core
[462:24.89]I don't think this- this thing's broken.
[462:54.98]What the hell is this?
[463:10.25]I have to turn on all the Cairn stones.
[463:14.87]I know the word!
[463:15.59]I know the word!
[463:16.05]I know the word!
[463:16.51]I know the word!
[463:17.03]I know the word!
[463:17.63]I know the word!
[463:18.67]I know the word!
[463:19.19]I know the word!
[463:20.59]I have to spell out the coordinates.
[463:24.69]Okay, it's... It's like an L, right?
[463:27.32]I wish I... Just stop moving.
[463:42.33]Like this?
[463:47.44]No?
[463:54.46]It's like a weird L. Is it still?
[464:11.35]I'm holding A. This is definitely how you spell out those coordinates.
[464:19.57]This is gonna be really hard to do.
[464:20.83]Um...
[464:24.42]I don't know what they are.
[464:27.06]It's like C. Yeah, I don't know exactly what it looks like.
[464:33.15]Warp core is broken.
[464:34.27]Well, is this a warp?
[464:36.11]Am I warping right now?
[464:39.41]For all I know, this could be the fucking microwave.
[464:41.57]I don't have that info.
[464:57.32]I'm not going to be able to do this regardless, but this is where I have to put that in.
[465:00.37]Yeah, it's the three, it's three, one, two, okay.
[465:08.29]I mean, can I place it in here?
[465:17.49]Is that like what I'm supposed to do?
[465:21.10]Yeah, I'm dead anyways.
[465:22.18]Alright, well I found it.
[465:22.98]Is there anything else I can see before I die?
[465:28.14]Warp core has to go here.
[465:29.30]I don't have a warp core.
[465:30.94]I have a broken warp core.
[465:37.54]Can I take my ship's warp core?
[465:42.13]Do I have a warp core?
[465:44.05]Oh, time's up anyways.
[465:44.93]Is there anything else, like, over here?
[465:50.35]This dead person there?
[465:51.29]I don't know.
[465:58.03]Going down the hallways.
[465:59.01]I don't see... No, they're all closed.
[466:01.07]Just kill me.
[466:01.92]Bye.
[466:02.12]Just die.
[466:02.90]I have 0 health, 0 HP, 0-2, whatever.
[466:21.50]Okay, so I found the vessel.
[466:22.70]There's a broken warp core.
[466:24.34]That's where you input the coordinates.
[466:27.44]I need a warp core.
[466:28.34]I have to go back there with a warp core.
[466:30.19]Let's see what I learned.
[466:58.09]He's definitely not gonna finish this tonight, really?
[467:04.27]Is that much more to do?
[467:07.67]I have the core, I just, really?
[467:10.27]No way?
[467:13.65]You're really close.
[467:25.04]No way, though.
[467:28.26]Well, here we go.
[467:31.28]There's the vessel.
[467:32.04]Right.
[468:02.21]How have I still not done that?
[468:16.64]Black Hole Forge.
[468:19.95]Found a switch in the Meldwater District that raises and lowers the forge.
[468:22.75]The Black Hole Forge District is the highest district in the Hanging City.
[468:25.27]I know my name poke plan to create a new advanced warp core in the Black Hole Forge.
[468:30.66]I know my crafted warp cores at the Black Hole Forge before delivering them to Ash Twin.
[468:36.48]Well, that's where we're going to get one.
[468:44.95]Alright.
[468:45.93]Let's mark it.
[468:53.97]I need... Where is it?
[468:56.31]It's the... Brittle... Brittle Bramble, whatever it's called.
[468:59.55]Quantum Shard... Black Hole Forge.
[469:07.45]Alright, can I... Can I mark this?
[469:13.24]Suspended below the hang... I have to go to the Hanging City.
[469:16.30]I guess I can mark the Hanging City.
[469:18.28]Let's go!
[469:27.06]Have I been to the sixth location?
[469:28.24]Yes.
[469:29.46]I did that a very, very long time ago.
[469:34.92]I did that a long, long time ago.
[469:36.44]Like four or five hours ago, yeah?
[469:42.47]Remember that shortcut to the Hanging City?
[469:44.93]You know what?
[469:46.07]Yep.
[469:46.59]Where is it?
[469:47.45]I don't remember.
[469:48.41]Just tell me.
[469:50.09]I'm your friend.
[469:51.27]You can tell me these things.
[469:52.39]Just tell me.
[469:53.15]I'm your friend.
[469:56.62]I'm your friend.
[469:58.06]Near the North Pole.
[469:58.91]We're friends here.
[470:00.31]And it was the river?
[470:01.39]Water?
[470:01.75]Right?
[470:06.19]You and I, you and I are friends.
[470:07.97]You can tell me.
[470:09.77]Wear that shortcut.
[470:15.19]North Pole?
[470:15.89]River?
[470:19.81]You've never been to any of my birthday parties?
[470:21.31]Yes, I have.
[470:21.91]I was in a costume.
[470:25.61]I didn't want to give away my identity, so I came in a costume.
[470:37.75]Alright, we need the North Pole.
[470:39.06]It's like the place where there's a river flowing through it.
[470:50.44]Where is it?
[470:50.86]Over here?
[470:54.83]Where's that river?
[470:56.51]Right here somewhere, I think.
[470:57.33]Just get out.
[471:03.40]This is the south pole.
[471:06.36]Opposite side.
[471:13.92]Oh, you were the stripper.
[471:14.84]Are you ordering a costumed stripper?
[471:20.48]How does that make any sense?
[471:39.50]Close enough.
[471:46.98]Okay, it's like right here, right?
[471:56.61]There's water right here somewhere.
[472:17.15]that water there it is okay let's go back down let's go to the that city I think that just blew up right behind me where's that hole
[472:49.40]Where the hell is it?
[472:51.08]Is it on the... It's not on the other side, is it?
[472:53.24]The whole other side completely?
[472:54.50]There's a lot of fuel to this shit, too.
[473:07.75]Okay.
[473:20.46]Alright, now we need to go to the forge, which is... I'm not actually sure.
[473:26.51]To be honest.
[473:30.19]It's up, isn't it?
[473:36.09]City.
[473:43.56]It's the topmost level.
[473:44.78]I already read all this.
[473:52.20]Is there an elevator or something I can get on over here?
[473:58.93]All the way up there.
[473:59.67]Can I get up there?
[474:12.66]I gotta do the controls first.
[474:14.02]Oh, wait.
[474:14.42]Yeah, those are down here, aren't they?
[474:22.96]Alright, press the button.
[474:28.40]There it goes.
[474:28.86]Can I get on that while it's moving?
[474:36.34]No.
[474:39.27]Alright, I'm not gonna use any more fuel.
[474:43.27]Now I have to go up.
[474:45.91]Up here.
[474:48.27]Up, up, up, all the way up.
[474:49.61]Can I... Let me try this one first.
[474:50.99]This way, maybe?
[474:53.85]Can I go all the way up here?
[474:58.13]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[475:00.62]That's as far as I can go.
[475:01.64]Up even further.
[475:06.28]From here to there.
[475:06.98]Uh-huh.
[475:13.72]No?
[475:18.53]Is there another way to get here?
[475:20.91]Going this way.
[475:28.79]Yeah, this looks right.
[475:29.91]This looks kind of correct.
[475:31.13]Need fuel.
[475:44.14]No, how do I... That is wrong.
[475:49.13]What?
[475:50.57]How?
[475:51.47]Oh.
[476:18.12]um well there's what is that thing that's a teleporter isn't it where was there a teleporter wait
[476:49.86]I think they're gonna jump and look at it.
[476:55.12]Where was the teleporter that goes to here?
[477:02.13]It's this white and purple looking place.
[477:08.03]Is it over here?
[477:08.74]There's a thing here.
[477:14.08]Where the hell is the teleporter?
[477:21.16]Is it on a different planet?
[477:22.44]There's a couple of teleporters.
[477:28.66]Oh, fuck.
[477:34.92]Do I actually have to go and teleport from a different planet to here?
[477:47.74]But why can't I just fly?
[477:58.15]I... I... I've been streaming for too long for this.
[478:14.26]What is that?
[478:14.62]What is over here?
[478:15.20]There's something else I didn't get, I think.
[478:21.74]No, I did everything here.
[478:33.70]Where have I seen that cube before?
[478:36.36]I remember standing on it and... Where is it?
[478:45.45]Where is it?
[478:46.65]Where is it?
[478:47.35]Where is it?
[478:47.81]Where is it?
[478:48.15]I'm searching my brain right now.
[478:49.45]Where is that platform?
[478:51.65]I have to look at Brittle Bramble when it comes by.
[478:56.79]Where is it?
[479:12.18]Ashtwyn.
[479:14.16]We're gonna go to Ashtwyn.
[479:44.32]You going to Ashtwyn?
[479:45.40]Yeah, that's true.
[479:57.53]How is this not exploded?
[479:58.49]I was trying to just delete this and do it again and sleep at a campfire.
[480:06.13]Why are you still here?
[480:08.71]Explode already!
[480:15.91]Thank you.
[480:19.53]What?
[480:24.09]Just get out and repair it?
[480:25.45]No, I'm starting over.
[480:33.97]I'm starting over again.
[480:35.00]I think I'm stuck.
[480:41.34]What do you mean this isn't it?
[480:42.22]Where's the eject button?
[480:49.18]there's no eject button I'm almost out now if this thing is stuck back here I'm gonna burn myself to death in the fire
[481:33.19]I don't know, I don't know where the campfire is.
[481:35.45]I have no idea.
[481:39.90]This'll kill me, don't worry.
[481:54.45]Why is it so hard to die?
[481:56.21]I'm trying to die!
[482:04.25]What's in there?
[482:35.37]Here comes kazoo ending 2.
[482:36.55]Alright, how long?
[482:38.39]What, like a minute?
[482:39.58]Two minutes?
[482:40.70]How long is too long?
[482:42.60]For me to get to the planet?
[482:44.28]One minute?
[482:44.84]Two minutes?
[482:49.08]Probably two?
[482:57.80]I'm gonna say like two.
[483:05.79]It's gonna take about three minutes or so to get there.
[483:07.79]Okay.
[483:14.15]We are going to...
[483:37.70]Ash Twin.
[483:39.94]We are going to desperately try to find the teleporter to that place.
[483:45.48]Teleport to it.
[484:09.83]You didn't do the black hole forge thing.
[484:14.95]I'm gonna be out of time then.
[484:16.49]Like, I shouldn't have slept at the fucking campfire then.
[484:18.65]Why did I sleep at the campfire?
[484:29.36]Let me just see if this works.
[484:43.27]I'm gonna go under the sun.
[485:04.72]I just need a warp core, and I can end the... What do you...
[485:15.14]That almost seemed impossible.
[485:17.08]That was impossible, what just happened.
[485:19.59]I have no idea.
[485:20.23]I don't know.
[485:36.66]Use autopilot.
[485:37.32]Autopilot flies you into the sun.
[485:41.62]It just puts you in a straight line to wherever you're going and just goes straight into something.
[485:54.26]Alright, I'm gonna... How fast can I do this?
[486:18.53]North Pole.
[486:19.79]Do the controls.
[486:21.35]Teleport.
[486:28.35]These are the real gaming hours.
[486:44.29]Am I out of the atmosphere yet, sir?
[486:47.51]Am I allowed to turn?
[487:01.50]Sir, this is Wendy's.
[487:15.44]Okay.
[487:16.74]So we need to be in North Pole.
[487:17.92]I don't... Is this the North Pole?
[487:20.68]It's not.
[487:21.00]We need the North Pole.
[487:40.87]So... There it is.
[487:53.12]This side or the other side?
[487:54.60]It's the other side?
[487:56.12]It's the other side?
[487:59.00]This side, other side?
[488:01.85]Is it right there?
[488:02.37]Is it right there?
[488:03.89]Is it right there?
[488:05.21]It's right there.
[488:14.33]Okay.
[488:15.35]Turn on the controls.
[488:16.19]I'm going to come back up here.
[488:23.17]Alright, so how do I reliably get back up here?
[488:34.95]Just go back up that way.
[488:36.03]How hard is it?
[488:38.65]No, this way, this way, this way.
[488:40.07]Okay, then down here.
[488:44.37]Alright, right here.
[488:46.59]Turn this shit on.
[488:51.21]Going up, right?
[488:52.63]Okay.
[488:52.89]Controls are on.
[488:56.07]Let's get back up here.
[488:57.43]Back up!
[488:57.87]Okay.
[489:24.22]Alright, let's go.
[489:29.67]Now we head to the ash twin and we find that teleporter stand on.
[489:43.76]Let's go.
[489:56.64]Let's go alright.
[490:00.29]It's on the equator, but which one it's on the equator.
[490:03.67]It's one of those towers on the equator It's gonna find the one that has the at fight background
[490:38.14]So this is the equator here.
[490:42.16]I don't see any towers yet.
[490:43.50]I'll get hit by the fucking thing here.
[490:49.82]Alright, there's one here.
[490:58.47]Is it this one here?
[491:09.28]It's here somewhere.
[491:12.38]Oh, it looks like a sun.
[491:16.08]Alright.
[491:16.82]Not this one.
[491:23.21]What about another one?
[491:24.39]What about this way?
[491:33.29]What's this one?
[491:34.45]What's this one's shape like?
[491:35.23]Does it even have one in it?
[492:04.34]Is it the... Wait.
[492:08.00]This is the... It's not this one.
[492:09.97]It's not this one.
[492:10.47]It's not this one.
[492:16.57]This is the... This is this plan.
[492:19.27]Wait.
[492:19.63]No.
[492:19.79]This is the...
[492:31.59]No, this is this planet, right?
[492:33.13]Because that's the two pillars.
[492:38.16]Let me see.
[492:45.00]No, this ain't it.
[492:47.54]Watch, the ground's gonna... You're gonna see the ground.
[492:51.54]It's not white.
[492:55.30]Wrong.
[492:55.68]It used to be white.
[493:02.83]Another one.
[493:07.30]Okay, here it... Alright, so it looks like it's coming for me.
[493:20.26]Sun-shaped tower.
[493:22.12]That's this tower.
[493:26.40]Then there's... There's five towers, right?
[493:37.05]What's this one?
[493:43.09]That's shaped like a circle.
[493:49.02]Might be this one.
[493:57.52]They all teleport to a different place.
[494:03.14]No, that's fine with three.
[494:04.62]Well, there's oxygen here, thank God.
[494:16.63]Keep going.
[494:24.35]There is... Don't get too cocky here.
[494:27.63]Where's the last one?
[494:31.29]There should be two more.
[494:33.04]One here.
[494:34.78]Wait for this to go by so I can have an uninterrupted one.
[494:39.84]Yeah, here's another one.
[494:53.31]Is this another tower?
[495:01.16]Okay, what's this one?
[495:05.64]This one is... This is just a spot.
[495:09.86]But... Wait a minute.
[495:17.45]That's, uh... This is... We need the sand to go down.
[495:22.95]This is not Brittle Hollow, though.
[495:26.69]There's, like, the spike shit.
[495:28.44]Um...
[495:33.15]It's gotta be this one.
[495:34.57]It has to be this one.
[495:42.28]Is this the sun again?
[495:45.20]No, this is the sun.
[495:49.72]I did a false circle.
[495:54.35]Were there only four towers?
[496:12.20]Did I miss one?
[496:19.10]This one did I do go in?
[496:21.41]Ah, the sand's coming here, isn't it?
[496:30.24]Watch out for that fucking sand.
[496:52.25]What in Christ is the Lord closing?
[496:53.64]Alright, let's go.
[497:06.57]Okay.
[497:15.84]Brittle Hollow.
[497:25.06]That's not... That's not Brittle Hollow?
[497:34.73]Uh... What?
[497:47.04]Here's our first delivery.
[497:48.02]One Warp Core Freshman Black Hole Core.
[497:54.14]The sand's going up.
[497:58.68]I'm upside down right now.
[497:59.94]Alright.
[498:37.90]This is it.
[498:39.22]I gotta wait for- I gotta wait- Brittle Hollow has to be in view.
[499:00.74]Hey!
[499:07.18]Look at what happened.
[499:13.24]Alright.
[499:29.71]Black Hole Forge.
[499:32.67]Okay, there it is.
[499:33.83]Alright, give me my warp core.
[499:36.13]There's a bunch of shit in here.
[499:43.39]Whoops.
[499:54.94]Any... I'm just looking for writing.
[499:57.10]Okay, let's go back.
[500:12.08]There's the thing I plugged in.
[500:13.20]There's a... There's two.
[500:26.53]How much time do I have?
[500:32.54]I'm not sure I have enough time.
[500:33.48]Okay.
[500:46.51]Right.
[501:03.81]speed future deliveries to ash twin I've tuned the first black hole core to activate when its warp tower aligns with brittle hollow before anyone comments yes I am aware this reduces the distance between yarrow and V schematic shows the six towers on ash twin are being tuned to only five alignments a mistake no that's correct for these alignments we've decided to treat the hourglass twins as a single astral body right
[501:31.58]If it helps, you can imagine the Hourglass Twins as aligning with themselves.
[501:35.84]Have you seen Phlox's tower designs in the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin?
[501:38.39]They clarify each tower as a warp destination.
[501:40.07]Yeah, we kind of figured that out.
[501:41.73]Alright, we need a warp core.
[501:50.75]Here's a projection stone.
[501:59.76]Alignment 1, the sun.
[502:03.18]Alignment 2, Hourglass.
[502:04.48]Yep.
[502:04.72]Alignment 3, Timber Hearth.
[502:08.77]Yep.
[502:11.43]Yep.
[502:12.39]Mm-hmm.
[502:16.85]Alignment 5, Giant's Deep.
[502:18.27]Alignment 4, Brittle Hollow.
[502:22.89]So, yeah, they just correspond.
[502:24.71]Yep, yep, yep.
[502:27.34]Okay.
[502:28.98]A little bit more writing here.
[502:33.34]Of course.
[503:02.03]The white hole cores are for the six warp receivers.
[503:05.09]Each warp tower leads to a different planet, so that will be a greater pain in your cervical spine.
[503:11.75]So it's on Ashtwyn.
[503:12.53]So it's just on Ashtwyn somewhere.
[503:21.91]Delivered... ...someplace... ...that I need to find.
[503:29.58]Okay, let's use the stone and go read.
[503:31.22]I have good news, Yarrow.
[503:47.00]The advanced warp core is ready to be installed at the heart of the Ash Twin project.
[503:54.57]I'm intrigued.
[503:55.53]Love.
[503:56.59]Everyone on Ash Twin is excited to see it.
[504:00.67]No, it isn't.
[504:03.15]Is everything well at the forge?
[504:07.15]Don't worry, love.
[504:07.73]Poke is only nervous.
[504:09.13]The core is extraordinary, and her design work is beautifully clever.
[504:12.80]The core's durability could still be improved.
[504:14.54]I need more time.
[504:15.22]Ignore her, Yao.
[504:17.12]The core is finished.
[504:18.04]And if my sister tells you otherwise, then she will be finished as well.
[504:21.48]You're not killing your sister?
[504:22.45]What-
[504:33.43]Again, this thing, they're the one looking at me.
[504:46.31]Why do they, why are there two heads?
[505:06.21]Um... What was that?
[505:13.83]This is... Okay, this is freaking me out.
[505:23.69]Uh... Okay.
[505:26.79]Cool.
[505:27.62]So now... I know that the core is on Ash Twin.
[505:33.88]I need...
[505:37.25]teleport teleport to ash twin
[506:15.04]Uh, but I think I did everything I needed to do up there.
[506:19.18]It's okay.
[506:22.09]There was nothing else for me to do up there.
[506:23.39]There's no core up there.
[506:24.25]It was on Ashdwin.
[506:27.73]Yeah, I could have been way more upset about that.
[506:29.93]Alright, now let's break our legs.
[506:32.85]And our spine.
[506:48.42]I'm trying to scrape my face on that.
[506:51.22]Come on, just die.
[506:54.13]Come on, let me catch one of these.
[506:56.43]How have I not been hit by any stray cow or something?
[507:23.94]Got a bunch of new info.
[507:36.01]What have I not done?
[507:39.85]I don't have very many more connections.
[507:42.83]Ash Twin is one of the only things that's a question mark.
[508:13.39]Let's see where we're at now.
[508:19.00]Blackwell Forge, Ash Twin.
[508:20.78]That leads to here.
[508:22.36]Ash Twin.
[508:23.50]Oh, it's designed.
[508:31.08]Yeah, it's just Ashtwyn so far.
[508:36.81]The vessel has something to explore in Ashtwyn as well.
[508:42.79]An advanced warp core was successfully forged for installation at the heart of the Ashtwyn project.
[508:48.72]Like, in the heart?
[508:50.76]Inside of Ashtwyn?
[508:51.88]At the very, very middle?
[508:53.06]So I just have to wait until the thing goes to zero?
[508:58.52]And just go in the middle?
[509:21.56]I'll try it I'm just I'm gonna just explore and see if I can
[509:47.65]Ash Twin.
[509:49.19]Gotta get to the heart of the Ash Twin.
[509:55.04]I'm going too fast already.
[510:02.00]I think I saved it.
[510:05.65]How do I get to the heart of the Ash Twin?
[510:17.48]Am I in the equator?
[510:36.12]Yep.
[510:38.52]Yep, always on equator.
[510:53.19]Okay.
[511:00.57]So, if I have to get to the core of this... How is this still aligned?
[511:13.81]I just flew 5,000 feet to the left.
[511:16.04]It's not.
[511:26.17]create a rank wink redemption um do I just wait till it gets to the very bottom the sand and just stay here and just try to go right to the core right to where like the tootsie roll pop thing is
[512:12.17]Hold on.
[512:14.01]That's real.
[512:15.07]This is real.
[512:16.23]Wait.
[512:17.31]This is real.
[512:19.87]Wait.
[512:20.27]This is real.
[512:22.05]There's only one warp.
[512:23.39]I know what I have to do.
[512:34.34]There's one warp for both of these planets.
[512:39.74]I got a warp from that one.
[512:40.78]This one.
[512:44.85]Or vice versa.
[512:48.23]I gotta warp from this one into that one.
[512:49.47]Let me give that a try.
[513:05.10]I warp into myself?
[513:09.14]So if there's the two tower one, and I warp into it,
[513:15.97]The fucking name of the goddamn game is called the two tower project Of course, it's gonna be the one that's the two to twin the twin tower one Go into the twin tower one teleport and there it is The ash twin project
[513:47.96]you'll see let me look let me look let me see let me go read it probably wait for the the sand to get out of here look ash twin ash twin towers design
[514:35.50]No, I got it.
[514:36.14]I'm gonna teleport to myself.
[514:50.41]Wait for the sand.
[514:53.73]Alright, there's the sun.
[514:56.99]Looking for the... Is it this way or the other way?
[514:59.13]Let's see.
[515:03.96]Is the sun behind me?
[515:07.48]I feel like I'm playing Tribes Ascent.
[515:30.06]Where are they?
[515:30.68]Is it still taking too much time?
[515:42.19]Where are these other towers?
[515:43.09]Come on.
[515:46.08]Here we go.
[515:52.56]There are the two towers.
[515:56.12]Now, I need to wait for the sand to get down here.
[516:04.49]And I'm going to teleport.
[516:06.05]Look at this.
[516:06.51]There's a teleport thing here.
[516:12.71]And there is not one here.
[516:23.76]I gotta stand right here.
[516:25.72]I'm gonna wait until the sand goes over me.
[516:29.70]And I'm gonna teleport through into the sand in the element.
[516:38.57]Oh, not here.
[516:39.37]I'm talking about down under the glass.
[516:46.02]Speaking of which, I gotta get the fuck out of the way.
[517:20.87]okay wait there's another one there's two but this is broken
[518:27.81]Wait, is it gonna line... Am I gonna see it?
[518:33.70]Am I gonna see it?
[518:34.90]I might see it!
[518:39.06]When is it gonna happen?
[518:55.43]But it hasn't happened.
[519:19.79]Now?
[519:31.38]Wait!
[519:31.74]Here it comes!
[519:33.11]Here it comes!
[519:35.27]Here it is!
[519:36.97]I- Ow!
[519:40.41]What?
[520:02.71]Wait, these are all the faces.
[520:04.73]10 minutes, 45 seconds.
[520:12.09]Receive data from previous cycles.
[520:15.40]Masks receiving data from probe tracking module.
[520:18.28]Giant steep memory statue.
[520:19.66]Timber hearth memory statue.
[520:23.72]12 minutes until end of cycle transmission.
[520:38.17]We need a thing.
[520:38.53]The Ash Twin Project.
[520:52.62]Powerful enough to send information back in time.
[521:09.83]How far we've come since our experiments at the High Energy Lab.
[521:12.97]I still can hardly believe Rami's hypothesis was true.
[521:19.26]We've also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging.
[521:25.14]We'll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we've altered the environment here.
[521:35.24]just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the black hole forge now ash twin can be connected with giants deep but cassava is working with avens to craft the orbital probe cannon and where flox is sculpting the memory statues hypothesis it was not by accident the court of our warp tower was last to be forged
[522:01.23]cores could have been forged faster if Sava had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates the important point is we are all connected through the ash twin now we made the internet that's what they're saying and also that I'm no longer needed for mediating your disagreements
[522:32.63]Our friends on Giant's Deep tested the Orbital Probe Cannon today.
[522:35.69]That all tells me the cannon is doing well, and that Avens advocates for more launch power.
[522:41.43]If anyone can coax the maximum power from a device, Avens can.
[522:47.13]Then, if anyone can goad a device into exploding, that too is likely Avens.
[522:51.85]Perhaps I should check in with the Oracle probe cannon crew in the interest of safety.
[522:56.92]Would it help to remind Avens that Mallow, his love, will be one of the Nomai onboard the cannon?
[523:03.36]Or is Mallow part of the problem?
[523:08.36]Hawks and dads finished the memory statues today, and they are truly remarkable.
[523:12.59]When the Ash Twin project succeeds, or in the event that it fails, the memory statues will activate, allowing us to gather more data before we shut down the project.
[523:25.27]Got to get my boomer belt activated.
[523:27.21]Okay.
[523:52.42]When pressed by their mental fortitude, this was the project's most difficult task in more ways than one.
[524:01.35]When nearly ready to activate the Ash Twin Project, here is what will happen.
[524:04.99]First, the Sun Station will receive the order to fire at the Sun, prompting it to explode.
[524:11.57]Using the energy from the resulting supernova, the Ash Twin Project will send the order for the Orbital Probe Cannon to fire back in time by 22 minutes.
[524:20.84]exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received the sun station will again trigger the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon's launch back in time in total each cycle created by the ashton project will last precisely 22 minutes we can end this cycle at will
[524:47.01]These words are difficult to write.
[524:48.82]The Sun Station did not work.
[524:52.56]Suppose we redesign the Sun Station to generate power of that magnitude.
[524:56.86]A supernova is still our only viable option.
[525:01.73]This is easier expressed than accomplished.
[525:05.93]You can wait for the Sun to explode on its natural timeline if you prefer, Ideia.
[525:10.59]But you'll need to find some way to halt our aging process.
[525:16.53]Final drawing.
[525:34.90]We are halting our research into creating a supernova for this moment.
[525:38.24]A comet has newly arrived in this solar system.
[525:42.40]We're anxious to explore it.
[525:43.52]It's been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new.
[525:49.63]So we're excited to welcome this comet.
[525:51.59]Imagine what knowledge might be gained there.
[526:01.84]Oh my god, there's a lot of stones.
[526:07.06]I read this already!
[526:34.05]I hadn't thought of that.
[526:34.85]What a profoundly horrific fate.
[526:36.55]They're trying to fix it.
[526:37.51]It's the total recap.
[527:05.82]Okay.
[527:06.04]Once we finish the shell that seals off the core, we'll check to ensure there are no longer any physical entrances.
[527:11.30]Remy and I will be checking the interior and then the exterior for cracks.
[527:15.76]Our final safety check.
[527:34.74]Mr. Lore Wallware.
[527:35.90]I think I've seen the rest of these.
[527:52.49]Almost prepared to receive the probe data.
[527:54.05]Yeah, we've seen these.
[527:58.33]Yep, yep, yep.
[528:03.58]Looking for the Eye of the Universe.
[528:04.90]I got these all.
[528:05.48]I have good news.
[528:17.27]The Advanced Warp Core is ready to be installed to the heart of the Ash Twin Project.
[528:21.87]That's where I am.
[528:22.53]No, it isn't.
[528:24.33]Yes, it is.
[528:24.85]Everything well at the forge.
[528:26.31]Don't worry.
[528:26.83]Yeah, we read this like five minutes ago.
[528:28.19]Okay, we're good.
[528:41.22]Artificial gravity control.
[528:42.60]Um... Can I turn it on?
[529:00.36]I wonder if, hold on, should I... What do I activate first?
[529:14.26]Wait, that's the... What?
[529:18.19]Hold on.
[529:18.69]This is the teleporter to... over there.
[529:24.03]Turn on this...
[529:45.65]Wait, we're flying around.
[530:02.00]You're about to access the core while the Ash Twin project is active.
[530:07.74]Removing the core will disable the Ash Twin project.
[530:14.97]What?
[530:21.43]There it is.
[530:21.97]I got it.
[530:52.92]Okay, now we have to... We gotta leave now.
[531:16.47]I have the core.
[531:17.39]I've got it.
[531:18.25]I've got the core to power this ship.
[531:23.27]Let's go!
[531:24.55]Where's the ship?
[531:35.23]I gotta go put this in the core?
[531:47.01]I don't know where to put it!
[531:48.41]I don't know where to put it!
[531:51.15]In my ship?
[531:57.16]Alright, it's going to my ship.
[532:12.69]I can't get to where this needs to go fast enough.
[532:17.23]I can't get to where it needs to go fast enough.
[532:21.61]What?
[532:28.94]Wait, hold on, wait.
[532:29.92]The project isn't going.
[532:31.30]Buckle up.
[532:34.22]There's no supernova.
[532:41.24]Don't fly into the fucking sun.
[532:43.04]Don't fly into the fucking sun.
[532:45.46]The fuck just hit me?
[532:49.80]Okay, now I gotta go.
[532:50.80]Um...
[532:56.82]Um, I have to fly to Dark Bramble.
[533:02.91]Wait, why is everything getting sucked into the sun?
[533:11.29]Throw it into the sun.
[533:16.02]No, what?
[533:20.04]Throw the core into the sun.
[533:23.06]Where's Dark Bramble?
[533:34.24]This music is driving me crazy.
[534:07.33]okay I need to shoot the I need to shoot the thing into the beacon to get to the vessel so I can get there right I have to shoot the beacon into the thing
[534:32.86]I'm going 15 trillion miles per hour.
[534:38.01]Oh my God.
[534:40.13]Oh my God.
[534:41.03]Just don't get hit.
[535:01.93]No.
[535:04.37]Okay, I need to mark the distress signal on my- on my- I'm gonna mark the distress signal on my thing.
[535:12.62]Yep.
[535:14.02]Where's the vessel?
[535:15.16]Uh, the- the- this- here.
[535:20.29]Okay.
[535:21.81]Alright, we're good.
[535:31.02]Okay.
[535:38.54]Wait, no, I don't... I found it already.
[535:40.45]I already found it.
[535:40.92]I found it already.
[536:06.45]okay uh the fish are still here though so I can still die from a fish if I die from a fish I'm gonna be really mad if I crash into something and explode I'm gonna be really mad what are the symbols I gotta look at my notes
[536:37.92]But here's the thing, I have all the time in the world.
[536:46.80]I could just coast for like three hours.
[536:50.12]That's what I'm gonna do.
[537:04.11]Oh, you motherfucker.
[537:14.62]What's going on?
[537:22.22]Did I hear something?
[538:11.56]Why did it explode?
[538:12.72]I disabled the project.
[538:24.85]Yeah, so it couldn't blow up.
[538:32.11]Alright.
[538:32.97]I know.
[538:33.72]Let's just go get it and let's get the fuck out of here.
[538:35.86]Let's go.
[538:46.51]Do I have it?
[538:47.08]What if I still had it in my inventory?
[538:48.25]Alright, let's get it.
[539:19.50]Do we get it?
[539:20.26]We get the hell out of here.
[539:21.16]Get in the ship.
[539:22.06]Go.
[539:23.17]Go, go, go.
[539:24.15]Speaking of go.
[539:24.83]Alright, we're gonna try this one again.
[539:28.27]Fucking just crash into it, you dumbass.
[539:39.20]I have to speed up time anyways.
[539:40.82]So, you know what?
[539:41.38]Just... Just do it.
[539:44.70]I fucking have to speed up.
[539:45.42]I have to sleep.
[540:04.69]What it takes to fucking destroy a goddamn ship, I won't- I'll never know.
[540:07.63]I- I have to make the- I have to sit at the fire- the fireplace for like three, four minutes.
[540:20.62]I gotta sit at the fireplace so that I don't stand around for five minutes, ten minutes.
[540:24.66]Fuck.
[540:29.57]I thought I had all the- the world.
[540:41.10]Emote only.
[540:41.84]We can't help him, but we can't hurt him either.
[540:44.10]I'm going to do four minutes.
[541:03.97]I also want to look at what the symbols are, because I'm not going to have very much time.
[541:15.97]I didn't even do anything.
[541:17.87]A zit just popped on my forehead.
[541:19.43]I didn't do anything.
[541:20.01]I didn't touch it.
[541:39.08]One more for old time's sake.
[541:40.10]No, no.
[541:40.72]I wanted a marshmallow.
[542:03.90]What are the symbols?
[542:10.13]No, fuck it.
[542:10.93]No.
[542:11.47]Alright, just... Just go to the... Ugh, planet.
[542:31.41]We could just look up, teleport to that weird place, grab the core, park the ship in a safe spot, get the hell to the bramble, and go.
[542:44.00]By the way, there were two errors.
[542:46.34]There was an error and an error.
[542:47.56]It's the red one, then the white one, right?
[542:50.81]You can help me out on this, I don't care.
[543:08.84]Help me, please.
[543:10.36]I'm so close.
[543:17.81]There's a wink.
[543:24.03]Alright, this is not the right one.
[544:04.78]Go.
[544:05.68]Get me in there.
[544:14.94]Is this a blindfold run?
[544:17.08]Um, yeah.
[544:19.16]Pretty tough.
[544:20.44]It's the broken one.
[544:22.46]Come on, get me in before another whole cycle goes through.
[544:29.54]I've gotta grab this.
[544:31.42]Okay, here we go.
[544:33.98]Gotta grab that warp cord.
[544:35.08]Fell in love with a girl at the rock shore.
[544:39.81]She said, well, I told her that, didn't I?
[545:02.47]Why is it not happening this time?
[545:13.48]Why did it not happen?
[545:30.50]Why did it not happen?
[545:33.26]I didn't jump.
[545:36.92]I-I didn't jump.
[545:40.50]I got s- I- What- what- okay, sir, but honest to god, what happened here?
[546:03.74]Do I have to bump my head and then fall back down?
[546:12.49]Didn't... Sand holds you off of it.
[546:16.81]How are you supposed to stay on this?
[546:18.73]How are you supposed to stand still?
[546:19.79]Sand's going to do that every time.
[546:24.84]What?
[546:40.46]Can I even reach it from here?
[546:41.32]Can I like throw myself into space?
[546:46.96]Yes, kind of, but it's not gonna help.
[546:55.81]Can I please just do this?
[547:23.23]No, I missed the cycle.
[547:29.25]I'm losing a lot of time here, too, though.
[547:30.88]And now I have to... Wait.
[547:32.78]Ah, goddammit.
[547:33.96]I reset the whole thing.
[547:35.56]Can I get in there and do it right now?
[547:36.90]No.
[547:40.94]I just... The sand went up more.
[547:50.56]Well, here we go.
[547:55.12]Wrong one.
[547:58.62]So... I... I have to stand in this... Here?
[548:05.20]So I don't get sucked up and then just go like this?
[548:13.69]Wait, under the lip here?
[548:16.41]That's... That's... Come on.
[548:19.85]That is a, like, dot, dot, dot, come, dot, dot, dot, on.
[548:25.18]Kind of like, come on.
[549:02.16]Is this gonna stop me?
[549:02.86]Am I in the right spot?
[549:21.47]Stand on the blue.
[549:22.61]I...
[549:36.65]No, stand under the thing!
[549:37.85]Okay, here we go.
[549:57.31]One.
[549:58.57]Two.
[550:00.79]Three.
[550:22.51]Are you sure you want to proceed?
[550:33.46]Yes, Windows.
[550:34.24]Fucking authorization bullshit.
[551:03.27]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[551:56.01]fuck is happening I turned on autopilot instead of reading a book let's go wait wait wait what hold on can I teleport to dark dark teleport dark bramble try teleport dark bramble no okay alright
[552:25.12]And we've confirmed.
[552:27.06]We've confirmed.
[552:27.70]It's red first and then white, right?
[552:45.03]Just red?
[552:47.11]No, white then red.
[552:48.39]My god, I'm going really fast.
[552:50.17]I'm sorry.
[552:51.01]I have to fucking look at chat.
[552:53.94]It's fucking stressful.
[552:55.98]Was it red?
[552:57.16]White, then red.
[552:58.24]Please tell me the truth.
[552:59.80]Please tell me the truth.
[553:00.40]Don't lie to me.
[553:01.36]Not now.
[553:04.36]Oh, the marker?
[553:04.76]That's what I'm saying.
[553:05.30]There's two markers.
[553:08.01]Red.
[553:08.49]Okay, I'm going to listen to fucking six of you.
[553:21.91]No!
[553:22.13]No!
[553:44.62]Why is the end of the game like this?
[554:04.45]I can't even go fast in there because the angler fish are in there.
[554:08.09]And now I have to do this all over again.
[554:21.01]Can't I get a checkpoint with this fucking stupid thing in my hand?
[554:25.32]I didn't even use a campfire.
[554:59.32]Thank God Jerma doesn't have a real job.
[555:01.28]Why?
[555:01.56]Because it's late?
[555:15.29]Yes.
[555:15.81]Oh, let me go over here.
[555:18.01]Let me assess you as a person.
[555:20.13]So, in the video game Outer Wilds, it seems that you didn't go quickly to the red dot fast enough for me to... I'm sorry.
[555:28.52]I'm going to have to dock you a few points.
[555:29.74]It's like a restaurant waiter.
[555:31.68]I can't believe it.
[555:32.50]Yeah, I just... I couldn't believe it.
[555:34.58]Yeah.
[555:34.90]No, no, no. ...
[555:46.76]I was going over your I was going over your resume guy that drives a bus and uh How come you didn't see the there was more writing that was on the wall there that you you didn't you didn't look at I'm upset by this therefore you can no longer drive a bus.
[556:08.61]Oh, yeah wrong fucking planet I can't even drive a bus
[556:32.50]Alright, I'm going to try this one more time and I'm going to YouTube the ending.
[556:39.68]It's been almost nine and a half hours.
[556:47.42]Don't you dare.
[556:48.80]What does it really matter if I YouTube the last eight minutes of the game?
[556:55.34]I'm going to YouTube it.
[556:56.82]I'm going to YouTube it.
[557:00.75]I can't believe I have to fly through Bramble Place again.
[557:03.47]I'm YouTubing it.
[557:04.25]I'm going to youtube.com slash fucking... No, you know what?
[557:13.83]I'm just going to open up the Wikipedia page for this game and just read the end in one sentence.
[557:33.84]Am I still on the equator?
[557:37.52]Yes.
[557:38.02]Oh my god.
[557:39.15]I just want to be done.
[557:40.05]Is it far enough?
[558:35.11]Please, man.
[558:36.79]Just can I fucking just shut the warp core?
[558:39.90]I can't even go.
[558:41.28]Wait, no.
[558:42.00]God exists.
[558:43.28]God exists.
[558:44.00]It's gonna fall back down to us.
[558:45.52]Where am I?
[558:46.00]No, it's not.
[558:52.88]Fuck me, man.
[559:07.31]I have- I need that ship to fly to the Bramble Place.
[559:20.45]You still didn't watch like a deer in headlights?
[559:22.03]Yeah, because I'm at the end of the tunnel.
[559:25.95]And the tunnel has no oxygen in it.
[559:29.10]And I have to go through it.
[559:30.16]And hold my breath and fucking just try.
[559:41.09]I'm trying it one more time.
[559:52.42]Just read Game Boomers instead.
[559:54.32]I'm at the final part of the game.
[559:59.13]This is actually the end of the whole game.
[560:04.78]This is the it.
[560:06.22]I just have to do this.
[560:07.18]I just have to wait for the stupid fucking god damn it.
[560:10.72]I'm going to bed.
[560:20.92]Somebody said that they didn't have campfires before a patch.
[560:24.08]How many times have they patched the end of this game?
[560:36.57]three times.
[560:37.09]We've patched this game four times for the end of the game.
[561:01.01]Okay.
[561:05.36]This is gonna be the one.
[561:38.04]He hates us.
[561:38.74]He hates this game.
[561:39.72]He hates everything.
[561:43.31]No, it's just... It's just having to fly through the bramble place again and get eaten by a fucking monster.
[561:49.70]Kinda sooks.
[562:12.74]You're not going to actually kill me again.
[562:14.24]Is autopilot going to kill me here?
[562:36.26]Autopilot was going really, really fast.
[562:38.80]And it was going to go right into the sun.
[562:45.03]Alright, can I not make it like 30 for 30 landing right on the equator?
[562:50.37]That would be great if I- That would be fantastic.
[563:13.45]Get me the fuck out of this boat.
[563:29.82]Alright, now I got another minute or two.
[563:44.74]The one after the sun.
[563:45.74]Okay.
[563:46.20]Ugh.
[564:19.99]Who's your favorite girl from Lovelight?
[564:23.83]I don't know what that is.
[564:24.73]I'm gonna just say... I don't know.
[564:29.43]I don't know what that is.
[564:34.71]Alright, let's get it first try.
[564:35.99]Let's get the hell out of this.
[564:37.81]And then put this thing in.
[564:39.89]And then I also need to type in the code.
[564:45.28]So...
[564:55.84]What's the code?
[565:00.48]Don't worry about the code.
[565:03.96]I have to write this code down, don't I?
[565:05.32]Which one's broken?
[565:10.61]Come on.
[565:17.65]Where's the mechanic where I can smash my fucking head into the wall and have ten minutes go by?
[566:17.83]Okay, let's go.
[566:29.93]So have we confirmed red, then white, then red, or white, then red, then white?
[566:33.48]Because there's two fake ones. ...
[566:51.67]Yes, I know.
[566:52.83]Put it on.
[566:54.19]Alright, come on.
[566:56.87]Let's go.
[567:01.61]Technically, either will work.
[567:04.75]The white one avoids the fish.
[567:08.44]Okay, here we go.
[567:34.30]Where's my ship?
[567:35.14]Where is it?
[567:37.92]Far away.
[567:38.64]Right here.
[567:42.77]Okay.
[567:43.57]Coordinates.
[567:43.93]Set them.
[567:44.25]Set them.
[567:44.57]Here we go.
[567:45.61]This is the one.
[568:27.47]I'm going white first.
[568:29.71]And then I'm gonna try to float... gracefully into red.
[568:36.75]Going too slow?
[568:37.67]The one time that I'm going too slow!
[568:41.31]Going red first, and then we're gonna gracefully float into... You guys told me I was going too slow.
[568:45.15]I'm not looking at chat.
[568:47.03]No more chat.
[568:47.35]No more chatting.
[568:47.77]No more chat.
[568:48.09]No more chat.
[568:48.45]No more chat for me.
[568:52.71]Oh my fucking god!
[568:53.95]I gotta make it a good shot!
[569:02.28]but there's a fucking there could be a fish right there there's a fish next to me or something there's a fish I can't move there's a fish
[569:26.91]Don't pump anybody.
[569:29.77]Don't pump anybody.
[569:30.61]Okay, there's the vessel 1.2 kilometers that way.
[569:39.97]Don't fucking floor it.
[569:41.23]No.
[569:43.93]How much time do I have?
[569:44.81]Anybody have any idea?
[569:45.57]Is it like 10 seconds, 30, like 10 minutes?
[569:47.57]One minute?
[569:48.05]Five minutes.
[569:49.06]Floor it.
[569:49.52]I can't floor it.
[569:50.90]I can't floor it.
[569:51.70]I can't floor it.
[569:52.62]They're everywhere.
[569:53.54]I don't know where to go.
[569:55.04]I can't floor it.
[570:00.66]I'm going too slow.
[570:01.24]I can't floor it.
[570:01.84]I can't.
[570:07.20]Floor it.
[570:07.46]You're a coward.
[570:08.28]Floor it.
[570:10.62]Motherfucker, I can't floor it.
[570:14.82]You're going to run out of time.
[570:15.61]I'm going to... I have to move a little bit.
[570:17.96]Is it safe?
[570:44.17]I hear fish.
[570:44.89]I hear fish.
[570:45.91]I hear fish.
[570:46.61]I hear fish.
[570:54.85]There it is.
[570:55.69]Is there fish here?
[570:56.29]Nope.
[571:02.27]No fish here.
[571:04.75]There's no fish here.
[571:08.95]Floor it.
[571:09.29]Floor it.
[571:09.61]Floor it.
[571:09.95]Get in.
[571:10.39]Get in and just go and type in the code.
[571:12.70]What's the code?
[571:14.14]Am I in it?
[571:24.76]I'm like tilted.
[571:28.10]Am I in it?
[571:35.09]No, no, no, no.
[571:35.69]Wrong way.
[571:36.15]Wrong way.
[571:39.89]There it is, there it is!
[571:43.93]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[571:45.45]Put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in.
[571:48.43]Put it in, put it in there, put it in.
[571:50.59]Okay, slow down.
[571:51.41]Whoa, Betsy.
[571:54.33]Slow down, put it in.
[571:58.17]Is she you?
[572:06.07]Now is not the time for you to have to
[572:10.57]What the fuck is going on right now?
[572:12.82]Is there any... Quartnets!
[572:20.98]Okay, Quartnets.
[572:21.66]R. L. What?
[572:32.05]Is that it?
[572:32.51]That's it, right?
[572:33.13]Yeah?
[572:33.61]Yeah?
[572:34.19]Yeah?
[572:39.74]How do I say yes?
[572:40.86]How do I accept?
[572:52.29]Put it in the bottom left.
[572:53.49]Go down then to the right.
[573:00.69]This next one is, oh my god.
[573:03.14]Here.
[573:03.36]And here.
[573:05.56]Here.
[573:06.58]Here.
[573:06.78]Confirm.
[573:09.74]Last one is all fucked up.
[573:11.26]Last one's all fucked up.
[573:12.78]Let me get it right.
[573:14.78]Bottom left corner.
[573:18.56]Bottom left corner.
[573:20.68]Up.
[573:22.24]Around the whole thing.
[573:23.40]Down.
[574:01.40]I might not have time.
[574:04.08]I don't care about jokes.
[574:08.77]I might actually not have time for this.
[574:14.49]Uh...
[574:32.62]How are this?
[575:12.53]Uh... What is that?
[575:30.10]That's the sun.
[575:54.90]Oh, it's those rocks.
[575:55.68]It's the quantum rocks.
[575:58.52]Why is this thing making human noises?
[576:17.11]What?
[576:26.91]What the hell are you doing?
[576:31.41]Oxygen refuel.
[576:34.33]I'm doing that.
[576:34.85]You're trying to block me.
[576:59.73]Okay.
[577:00.87]Uh, there's an opening up here.
[577:02.73]Uh...
[577:27.33]What?
[577:28.23]Like, go down the toilet?
[577:34.35]Can I stand on this?
[577:43.95]Wow.
[577:58.83]Connection lost.
[577:59.72]Um...
[578:41.92]I just jump in it?
[578:45.83]Wait.
[579:10.15]Imagine if I died.
[579:11.11]I would fucking laugh so hard.
[579:17.47]I think I can climb that.
[579:22.73]Yeah, hold on, I can get there from here.
[579:33.69]Oh, oh, it goes upside down.
[579:40.58]Well, me and my custom Switch remote, one of my Joy-Cons, the right Joy-Con, brought it this far.
[579:54.69]Here we go.
[580:02.24]Wink.
[580:02.52]Literally, I like the fucking big reveals.
[580:29.26]carter wild adventures was founded by feldspar gossens slade and hornfels to explore solar system at the end of the universe but no mind never got to see it for themselves but thanks to their efforts and technology our hearthing was able to reach the eye of the universe
[581:03.09]So what?
[581:15.33]At the end of its lifespan, our sun collapsed under its own gravity and then exploded in a violent supernova.
[581:24.47]You're really fucking ruining this ending, aren't you?
[581:52.76]The nomai who came to our solar system were following a signal from the eye of the universe.
[581:57.04]It perished when the interloper arrived, bringing with it the deadly substance we called ghost matter that flooded the entire solar system almost instantly and without warning.
[582:34.27]Missed the plaque.
[582:46.15]Of all the lifeforms who will perish in the oncoming death of the universe, we will miss the anglerfish the least.
[582:58.09]Kind of mean.
[582:58.51]Fairly rude.
[583:17.08]Ornfeld's observations.
[583:18.70]This is incredible.
[583:19.36]At first I thought the points of light in this image were stars, but they're not.
[583:22.18]They're galaxies.
[583:24.04]And this image covers just a tiny patch of the whole sky, which means the universe contains at least a thousand times more galaxies than we previously thought.
[583:30.03]I think I need to sit down.
[583:33.99]This is odd.
[583:34.47]According to my redshift calculations, every single galaxy in this image is moving away from us.
[583:40.49]In fact, the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away.
[583:44.45]Almost as if the entire universe is expanding.
[583:47.61]But that's true.
[583:48.91]Was everything closer together in the past?
[583:51.11]How far back can we extrapolate?
[583:52.85]Did the universe have a beginning?
[583:53.93]Hmm.
[584:29.72]Ow!
[584:31.26]What?
[585:04.18]No, I'm just... I'm in a forest now.
[585:23.98]It's pretty, yeah.
[585:34.97]I hear somebody playing something.
[585:36.27]What's over there?
[585:37.91]What's the blue?
[586:06.22]When do we get to go home?
[586:11.58]This is a dinosaur track.
[586:28.73]Wait, what?
[587:16.17]Want him.
[587:16.93]Vampire?
[587:36.45]Did I just spit that into my helmet?
[588:03.33]Hi, Phil, whatever your name is.
[588:05.55]Esker.
[588:06.89]Do you hear music?
[588:17.98]Did I?
[588:18.28]Are you hearing music?
[588:35.33]Uh... Anybody in here?
[589:47.28]Gather.
[589:54.51]I have a banjo.
[590:03.58]I guess I'm going to bring it back to you.
[590:09.74]You can have this.
[590:16.76]Oh.
[590:19.08]You're here.
[590:21.88]It's not quite time yet.
[590:23.43]I'm pretty sure we'll need the others for this next part.
[590:25.63]We'll need, you know, everyone.
[590:27.65]Don't rush.
[590:27.97]Take your time.
[590:29.09]I might not even exist here.
[590:37.39]Alright, I'm gonna fucking quantum yeet these motherfuckers out of here in a second.
[590:40.27]Here we go.
[591:11.25]Hi!
[591:11.99]Can I die here?
[591:13.57]Can I die here?
[591:37.51]Why am I gathering all these random people?
[591:44.47]Feldspar.
[591:44.95]Hatchling, you found me.
[591:45.93]Nice to have company around a campfire, isn't it?
[591:47.50]Go on, get the others.
[591:48.18]I wouldn't want them to miss it out.
[592:33.83]What the fuck did I just get?
[592:34.79]It was Santa Claus!
[592:53.51]Stars are beautiful, weren't they?
[592:54.67]Even if our star is what ultimately killed us.
[592:57.71]I'll wait here and remember them while you gather everybody.
[593:20.13]What are you guys looking at?
[593:20.87]Okay.
[593:47.48]You're building a skeleton ladder.
[594:52.02]Uh, what did- Gather.
[594:54.54]Mask.
[594:59.05]Ooh.
[595:10.46]It's you.
[595:10.98]I'm collecting all my friends.
[595:22.39]quiet shade across old bark in the ancient glade it's always dark
[596:11.22]Okay.
[596:12.88]Is that everybody?
[596:15.32]That's everybody.
[596:15.82]There ain't nobody else.
[596:26.59]What do you say?
[596:27.18]Time, buddy?
[596:27.88]Ready to start the music?
[596:29.84]Yeah.
[596:30.98]This should be cool.
[596:42.21]Get it going.
[596:42.63]Let's play.
[596:56.22]A conscious observer has entered the eye.
[596:58.94]I wonder what happens now.
[597:00.48]Is it time to find out?
[597:01.30]Not yet.
[597:19.65]Into the fire!
[597:51.07]Let's find out this song is new to me, but I'm honored to be a part of it
[598:37.20]He made a fucking party balloon.
[598:38.42]I admire your curiosity, friend.
[598:40.82]Let's find out.
[599:05.15]Cut it a little close, don't you think?
[599:06.49]Well, it worked out alright in the end, I suppose.
[599:08.62]I hope there are beasties in the next one.
[599:13.82]Wow, how long has it been since I got to make music with everyone around Campfire?
[599:16.39]I'm really happy we're all here.
[599:17.43]Even if it's over now, I had a good time learning, but I think the rules are about to change.
[599:25.03]Time for something new.
[600:16.51]We're just going into the light apparently
[600:51.06]okay so we we went we we blew up restarted the universe rebirthed the whole universe
[601:20.87]We just made a new... Yeah, just make a new one.
[601:25.25]That was a pretty crazy ending sequence.
[601:33.52]That was kind of all over the place.
[601:42.91]That was really good.
[601:49.59]You wanted to YouTube it.
[601:52.43]No, I just... I just didn't want to fucking keep failing.
[602:00.40]How would I have ever YouTubed that?
[602:01.90]We would have watched somebody else stream the game.
[602:03.66]What are your first impressions?
[602:16.43]I love time travel.
[602:17.79]That's a really cool concept.
[602:20.49]I feel like this is one of those games that I'm going to want to go read the Reddit or the Wikipedia and just kind of reprocess everything and have people tell me how cool everything is.
[602:31.00]There's still things I didn't do, yeah.
[602:53.45]I can see why people say this is one of their favorite games last year.
[602:57.63]I can understand it.
[602:59.59]Makes sense.
[603:01.24]Pretty unique.
[603:15.24]No, I only got frustrated at like two parts.
[603:19.78]The sand taking a long time was always, you know, that started frustrating me a little bit.
[603:34.85]He hates the sand.
[603:37.37]This was a college project.
[603:40.79]Was this actually a college project?
[603:43.25]Wait, what?
[603:44.00]No, there's like 500 people on this game.
[603:48.70]It's not a college.
[603:50.22]I thought like, wait, did an entire college make this?
[603:59.59]Every student apparently had something to do with it.
[604:11.88]Started as a college project.
[604:18.14]That was really, really cool.
[604:20.04]I'm glad I experienced it.
[604:23.52]You were so angry you had a zit pop on its own.
[604:27.23]Explain the story.
[604:28.83]Sure.
[604:30.83]There was this civilization of people that wanted to find as much knowledge as they possibly could.
[604:38.77]They came... While they were doing research and they ended up on this galaxy, they figured out that, uh-oh, this sun's going to explode.
[604:49.08]This sun's going to supernova and we're all dead.
[604:50.84]We've got to find a way to try to... We've got to make a way to stop it.
[604:54.34]So they get together and they have a bunch of people that are working on projects.
[605:01.63]And then one of those people figures out... Dude, there's a comet here that's killing everybody.
[605:05.99]And they all die from the comet.
[605:08.98]And then you come in.
[605:11.62]And you have to pick up the pieces...
[605:14.88]and solve the mystery that they left behind.
[605:18.43]As to why... This Super Omega wrong.
[605:41.34]Well, here's why this game is kind of hard to understand.
[605:44.77]Because there's no 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 sequences or anything like that, you can get this game's story like 2, 6, 1, 3, 5.
[605:53.68]So you can... Wait, 14.3 billion years later...
[606:27.91]I mean you're also telling me to explain an incredibly complicated complex intertwining time travel story after 10 plus hours sitting on a live stream talking to you guys
[606:48.68]I'm a little fried.
[606:50.26]What was that that flew by?
[606:58.05]That's you overshooting the planet.
[606:59.83]That was the best joke of the whole night, and I had nothing to do with it.
[607:16.79]Alright, that's it.
[607:17.95]Out of wilds, in the books, in the bag.
[607:33.82]Alright, let's give it a letter grade.
[607:35.22]Let me think here.
[607:37.24]This is going to be tricky.
[607:40.69]Hmm.
[607:41.03]This is going to be tricky.
[607:47.21]I don't think this is an A+.
[607:48.01]Nope.
[607:48.95]I don't think so.
[607:50.73]Hmm.
[607:58.73]I'm not sure this is an A either.
[608:03.06]I don't think this is a... I don't think this is a B. A+.
[608:11.04]I don't think so.
[608:15.23]No, no, I'm not talking about going down.
[608:17.07]Like, oh, I don't think this is a C. It's a C minus.
[608:20.40]No, no, no.
[608:21.32]That's not... I'm saying I don't... You're misconstruing what I'm saying.
[608:31.58]I'm gonna give it a B+.
[608:34.58]I'm gonna give this an 89.
[608:35.78]I'll give this an 89.
[608:44.95]Could have been a 90.
[608:45.55]Could have been... 89.
[608:46.67]What would I dock points for?
[608:48.35]You don't have to care what other things.
[608:50.61]Give us your own score. 89!
[609:19.42]What am I comparing it to?
[609:22.06]I don't know.
[609:28.21]Well, if you have a 10, you have a 10 point skill.
[609:30.31]10 is the best game I've ever played in my life.
[609:36.04]10 is the best thing you've ever done in your life.
[609:38.36]A 10 out of 10.
[609:48.58]Metacritic gave this an 85.
[609:49.76]Yeah, but that's from a million different places.
[609:59.71]89 out of 100 is... I tell everybody I know that this was worth playing, and you should play it, and it was great.
[610:06.64]But for me, when you climb into the 90s, like 90, 91, 92, 93...
[610:14.63]Like, for instance, last year, this came out last year, Resident Evil 2 for me was like a 95.
[610:29.24]So, an 89, that's very close, being my favorite game that came out last year.
[610:48.21]Imagine being so dumb that you compare this to Resident Evil 2.
[610:51.01]What?
[610:51.29]I didn't- I didn't- Wait, when did I say- You know my favorite part is the zombies!
[610:55.51]I- I said Resident Evil 2 was a 95 for me, and that was my favorite game of last year, so a game that came out last year as well that's an 89 is pretty damn close to my favorite game that came out last year is what I'm trying to say!
[611:16.29]What's a 10 out of 10?
[611:17.59]Team Fortress 2.
[611:20.19]And this game is not as good as TF2.
[611:22.09]Oh, fuck.
[611:28.05]Okay, I can only be a dick for so long before I have to fucking stop.
[611:33.16]Alright, so.
[611:35.30]That was very, very good.
[611:38.14]I am happy I played it.
[611:39.60]It was a great recommendation.
[611:41.18]I'm glad I played it.
[611:42.24]It was very good.
[611:54.45]Where's Bloodborne on that scale?
[611:57.41]98.
[611:58.75]Bloodborne is a 98.
[612:00.41]It's only two basis points.
[612:02.11]Two points are taken off because it's 30 FPS.
[612:05.25]If that game is 60 FPS, it's 100.
[612:07.13]Alright, we're going to be doing Tony Hawk tomorrow.
[612:14.92]Tony Hawk Underground.
[612:17.88]Should be a lot of fun.
[612:20.26]That was Outer Wilds.
[612:21.50]It was a very, very nice game.
[612:24.42]So good, in fact, that it was an 89.
[612:25.52]It was a B plus slash A minus.
[612:30.06]That means it was very fucking good.
[612:42.30]Don't even try it, Jeremy.
[612:44.36]You can't do that.
[612:45.34]What would you give Simpsons Hit and Run?
[612:53.50]Oh, that's easy.
[612:54.82]Probably a 4.
[612:55.51]Or a 5.
[613:02.73]Somewhere like a 4.8.
[613:03.49]Out of 100.
[613:03.95]No, out of 10.
[613:04.33]No.
[613:04.45]48 out of 100.
[613:25.21]Ooh, the vibrations!
[613:28.65]You guys are killing me.
[613:29.43]What would I give Jump King?
[613:32.31]I don't think you can even rate Jump King.
[613:37.14]Jump King is like going and riding a ride at Disneyland.
[613:39.92]You don't, you know what I mean?
[613:40.96]It's not like I, I feel like I can't even rate that game.
[613:49.21]Like you ride a ride at Disney and you're like, oh, that was, I've rid that ride.
[613:52.57]That was, I guess, cool.
[613:57.01]I can't score that game.
[613:58.67]You just jump into walls and scream.
[614:00.82]Like, I can't even score it.
[614:07.80]That was an experience.
[614:09.20]It wasn't really a video game that I'm going to play.
[614:11.64]I experienced that game.
[614:17.46]I wouldn't even call it a video game.
[614:18.72]I would call it just like a simulation for your brain to get angry.
[614:21.98]It's not even a game.
[614:24.06]What did I give Mario Tennis?
[614:25.22]A six.
[614:43.56]What do I give Cuphead?
[614:44.38]87, too short.
[614:46.24]Katana, zero.
[614:48.68]Hmm.
[614:49.32]70, um...
[615:22.01]80, no.
[615:22.19]79, too short.
[615:26.77]Any more?
[615:33.93]No more heroes.
[615:36.19]No more heroes on Wii or no more heroes the way I played it?
[615:45.50]The way I played it.
[615:46.90]On both.
[615:47.46]A Wii, it's like a 7-1.
[615:48.75]Or like a 6-8.
[615:52.85]Because the game runs like shit.
[615:56.45]It's like a... It's like a solid like 78.
[615:58.55]Or like 79.
[616:00.47]The way that I played it.
[616:06.84]I would give it... I would give it... No, it deserves an 80.
[616:08.84]It does.
[616:09.64]It deserves like an 80 flat.
[616:11.80]Just like a B-.
[616:13.86]Nancy Drew.
[616:16.74]Alright, we're done.
[616:17.32]We're not doing this anymore.
[616:18.16]I'm going.
[616:18.48]I'm going to leave.
[616:21.00]But if I had to give Nancy Drew a score... 95?
[616:22.40]94?
[616:23.64]Yeah, 94.
[616:31.75]And then, okay, goodnight.
[616:33.79]All the Drew crew, goodnight.
[616:36.49]We'll see you later.
[616:42.56]Okay, now that they've probably clicked the X, because a lot of them just definitely were leaving.
[616:46.52]It's like a six.
[616:48.08]No, it's like a four and a half.
[617:04.65]We gotta keep the Drew crew going, though.
[617:06.63]We can't just tell them that the game that they love is a six.
[617:13.58]Although... Yes, you can.
[617:18.15]Yes, you can, Jeremy.
[617:21.27]I do it all the time.
[617:27.62]Rating stuff.
[617:29.46]I give it a 9.
[617:29.86]Alright, let's do the bits.
[617:34.72]See you tomorrow, Tony Hawk, if you're leaving.
[617:37.94]Let's get through this.
[617:41.81]I've played Half-Life 1 already.
[617:42.83]I've played Half-Life 2.
[617:43.54]I know the story.
[617:44.58]I already know this stuff.
[618:20.50]Tell us the story.
[618:23.71]No, I'm not going to rifle off all the story beats for Half-Life 1 and 2.
[618:27.71]Somebody might not have played it yet.
[618:28.93]He doesn't know.
[618:37.93]You're a scientist and you push a crystal into... You're working on a project...
[618:44.65]You're a scientist working on a project, and you're trying to reach to find out as much as you can, because you're curious.
[618:51.94]And something about the sun is going to explode.
[618:56.04]The sun is going to explode.
[618:58.42]In Half-Life, that's what they know for certain.
[619:00.88]So, Gordon and a few others get together, and they try to figure out a way to make the supernova not happen.
[619:09.54]They end up dying.
[619:11.48]Then you play as the gameplay character who they named the G-Man.
[619:18.12]You walk around, you get a stick, you get a red crowbar.
[619:21.78]It's a really great game.
[619:28.79]And then there are these bugs that fucking drink your brain and shit.
[619:32.33]I know what they are.
[619:32.91]What are they called?
[619:35.01]The ambassadors or something.
[619:39.81]I know what I'm talking about.
[619:54.95]What a great story.
[620:00.31]Dude, just like, just explain the story to me.
[620:03.01]Alright, let's keep going.
[620:04.81]Uh, no, I'm not going to play Half-Life on stream.
[620:06.73]I'm not going to do it.
[620:07.27]I'm not going to do it.
[620:07.85]I'm not going to do it.
[620:09.13]LM, man, thanks for the thousand bits.
[620:10.31]Jerma, you are the son of sons.
[620:16.99]Thank you.
[620:17.67]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[620:19.61]Thank you, though.
[620:20.37]Thank you, SuperBruce, for the five community subs.
[620:22.58]Fifty three hundred bits.
[620:23.40]How the fuck did you not think of phylactery rich?
[620:48.51]That's pretty good, too.
[620:51.03]That's also pretty good, too.
[620:55.95]Attack of the Hank, thanks for five subs.
[620:59.44]Daddy Umbra gave 350 plus dollars tonight in bits.
[621:03.32]35,000 bits.
[621:04.46]Thank you, Daddy Umbra.
[621:05.32]Ridiculous.
[621:06.86]Insane amounts of money.
[621:09.92]Kazzy, five community subs.
[621:11.14]Thank you, Kazzy.
[621:14.43]That's fucking awesome.
[621:15.01]Well, the only thing I can really say to you is... College is not for everybody.
[621:41.26]And hopefully, I mean, it seems that you may have figured out that already, but you don't necessarily have to.
[621:51.89]You don't have to do that.
[621:53.99]And I know a lot of people think that college is kind of like the end of the world, like the end all be all, like I have to do this.
[621:59.66]But there's a lot of different things you can try.
[622:01.30]You can do trades.
[622:02.90]You can, um, I know like some people study foreign languages and they teach, they teach English.
[622:10.52]You can do that.
[622:15.11]Trades pay a lot of fucking money.
[622:19.03]They really do.
[622:20.41]Some of my closest friends in my whole life are in the trades.
[622:23.91]And they do really, really, really fucking well.
[622:33.09]So I really hope you don't think that potentially being out of college is something that should be a huge, huge, huge problem.
[622:42.83]Because it's not for everybody.
[622:43.85]It just isn't.
[622:58.34]Go to streamer school.
[623:00.78]Well, that's not real.
[623:07.01]Yeah, it's about finding something that works for you.
[623:10.47]Find something that works for you.
[623:13.07]You might not need to go to school for it.
[623:15.25]Well, I mean, a typical four-year college.
[623:19.66]So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[623:21.18]Plus, you can always try again later.
[623:24.98]If you really want to study something in college, you can try it again another time.
[623:30.44]I don't know how old you are, but if you're still young, some people, doesn't matter.
[623:34.01]Some people go to college in their 30s.
[623:36.79]And that's fine.
[623:38.21]That's alright.
[623:46.20]I wish you the best, though.
[623:49.60]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[623:52.79]It's a very long time to be watching this channel.
[624:19.19]Sometimes I assume people will watch it and kind of get bored after a few months or like a year and then be like, alright, that was cool for a while.
[624:25.45]But some of you guys have stuck around for an insanely long time.
[624:29.13]Almost 10 years for a lot of you guys.
[624:32.53]And that's crazy.
[624:33.85]I'm shocked, I'm happy, and I can't even tell you how... I'm glad you still think that this is a fun place to still be.
[624:46.60]And any of your challenges going on right now, Viraz, I hope you get through them.
[624:53.25]Take it slow.
[624:55.09]Stay focused.
[624:57.74]And do you.
[625:00.14]Help, I'm stuck here.
[625:01.10]Don't worry, I'll take care of that.
[625:05.36]Mod.
[625:06.22]Unmod.
[625:07.38]Demod.
[625:08.53]Purge.
[625:09.13]Ban.
[625:09.57]Remove Founder.
[625:19.38]Can I be a mod?
[625:21.78]Nah.
[625:22.72]Sorry.
[625:25.76]We also had Squishington.
[625:27.14]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[625:27.95]Love you, Jerma.
[625:28.47]Thanks for always making my day better.
[625:29.67]Thanks for making my day better because you hanging out here allows me to continue to do this and allows me to make enough monetary compensation to do something like this for a living, which is ridiculous.
[625:42.81]So thank you for sitting here and watching this because you're making my day better.
[625:49.88]Immensely.
[625:50.38]He's in it for the fucking money.
[625:57.95]No.
[625:58.71]But that's true.
[626:01.45]Without people watching, without people here, I don't know.
[626:08.60]Who knows how long I would have been able to do it.
[626:13.80]Remember, I'm starting to get a little older.
[626:16.40]And I'm not so sure, you know, let's say, rewind the clock 10 years.
[626:22.27]If my YouTube channel didn't really start gaining viewership when it did, I'm not sure I would have spent too much more time on it.
[626:31.73]Maybe after like a couple of years, like two or three, four years, maybe it'd be like, alright, I'm starting to be 30, so I'm going to try to figure something out.
[626:40.10]You know what I'm saying?
[626:40.66]So people being here, people watching, and the views, and the subscriptions on YouTube, I mean, and into Twitch.
[626:47.92]That's... You've allowed me to continue to do this.
[626:51.82]You've allowed me to make fun what I do for work.
[626:58.94]You know what I mean?
[626:59.84]Trying to just have as much fun as I can with as many people as possible.
[627:05.13]You've done... That's what you have done.
[627:09.69]Don't ever forget that.
[627:28.14]Like I said, the closer that I was moving into like my early 30s, it's, you know, I'm like, alright, what do I want to do now?
[627:36.10]And that still might happen.
[627:37.92]I don't have a crystal ball.
[627:39.05]I don't know how long Twitch and being an online content creator or, in quotes, an online entertainment influencer, end quote.
[627:52.42]I don't know.
[627:53.30]I don't know what the future holds.
[627:54.76]So I'm trying to keep an open mind about it and just kind of go with the flow and see what happens.
[628:02.81]Somebody was saying, hey, about the college thing.
[628:07.29]Like, Etalyx said about the college thing.
[628:10.07]I mean, I might be in my early 40s and be like, alright, now, what am I doing now?
[628:17.62]You got plenty of time.
[628:21.48]Produces, I screwed up your name again.
[628:23.70]And I'm probably going to get corrected for it.
[628:30.03]But it was produces a sand, and I know it's wrong.
[628:33.37]I already know it's wrong.
[628:34.49]Thanks for the six community subs.
[628:38.79]A little earlier.
[628:39.60]Hawkwing, thanks for 500 bits.
[628:41.14]Produce a sand.
[628:43.10]There it is.
[628:46.12]Thank you, Hawkwing, for the 500 bits.
[628:47.40]Jerma, why do you hate this game?
[628:48.48]It makes me sad.
[628:49.06]It's my favorite game.
[628:49.86]Why do you hate me?
[628:50.78]What?
[628:53.52]Jerma, why do you hate this game?
[628:54.62]It makes me sad.
[628:55.22]It's my favorite game.
[628:56.04]Why do you hate me?
[629:00.05]When did I say I hate this game?
[629:04.07]I just gave it an 89.
[629:16.88]That's a hater grade.
[629:18.70]Wait, hold on.
[629:20.13]Am I under the assumption that any game that's under a 90 is a game that the person hated?
[629:28.54]Isn't that reserved for a 3?
[629:34.04]I would give the Surge a 3.
[629:37.61]I would give... I mean, that's... So you're talking about going from a 3 to an 8.9.
[629:57.28]Giving the Surge a 3 is generous.
[630:09.01]FutureGamer, thanks for the 250.
[630:10.51]Will you also be doing the Get Well Soon card during the Diablo stream?
[630:14.23]I talked about it earlier.
[630:16.75]Yesterday, I think.
[630:18.37]And in the pre-stream chat as well.
[630:19.45]But I'm going to do the card alone.
[630:23.18]I'd rather experience that by myself.
[630:24.78]I feel like that's more appropriate for me.
[630:32.96]It lets me sit there and take it in by myself.
[630:40.53]So I will not be doing it on stream.
[630:45.17]Almost midnight Pacific.
[630:46.18]Yeah, I mean, this is a long one.
[630:47.16]I knew I wanted to get it done tonight.
[630:49.82]We'll be back tomorrow afternoon, Tony Hawk.
[630:56.70]Yeah.
[630:56.88]Being in that VR headset and broadcasting is... It just takes a lot out of you.
[631:23.46]Any VR stuff?
[631:25.50]Kinda, yeah.
[631:27.54]Besides Half-Life Alyx, obviously.
[631:32.86]That Walking Dead game came out.
[631:34.50]It kinda looks cool.
[631:37.44]Boneworks looks awesome.
[631:39.29]I really want to play it.
[631:39.99]There's at least two or three titles that I know that I want to play.
[631:50.19]Tarasov, thanks for the 400 bits.
[631:52.69]Appreciate it.
[631:56.16]Let's get the credits rolling.
[631:59.10]We're nearing the end here.
[631:59.84]I'm going to bump you, just be careful.
[632:15.81]They hand that guy.
[632:25.20]Hold on, let me just get it on the screen.
[632:26.74]It should be there.
[632:29.37]In three, two, one.
[632:34.97]There it is.
[632:36.63]Thanks to all the subs.
[632:39.23]The oil that continues to move the machine.
[632:42.81]Appreciate it.
[632:49.58]Thank you guys for letting me do what I do.
[632:56.55]I know maybe not every stream is your favorite.
[632:59.68]Maybe not every stream is my favorite.
[633:01.64]Right?
[633:04.54]Some streams are my favorite thing in the world.
[633:06.14]Some streams are your favorite things in the world.
[633:08.86]But at the end of the day, thanks for letting me do this.
[633:14.01]No, not this one.
[633:15.31]Not this one.
[633:16.11]This was fun.
[633:17.29]These last two streams, I've had a lot of fun playing this fucking game.
[633:21.17]I'm just saying in general.
[633:22.92]In general.
[633:23.40]In general.
[633:28.43]Give a game an 89.
[633:30.67]But all of a sudden... He's talking about Asura's wrath.
[633:44.62]God damn it.
[633:48.16]Alright, let me be real with you.
[633:49.52]This is the end of the stream.
[633:50.90]Half the audience is gone.
[633:52.66]Let me just be real with you guys.
[633:54.36]People fucking did not like that game.
[633:57.25]Can we be completely real here?
[633:59.23]People were not happy that I was playing that game.
[634:02.59]People were like, losing their minds.
[634:13.52]But, we're probably going to finish it.
[634:17.80]If this time after Diablo II, I'm going to try to play it.
[634:32.17]So, again, you know, some of your streams might not be your favorite streams or your favorite games, but thanks for continuing to come back and continuing to talk and continuing to hang out and still having fun.
[634:44.28]Because I am.
[634:47.80]We had a BoxBox raid earlier for a shitload of people.
[634:50.50]I don't know if you're still here.
[634:51.64]Some of you guys might still be here.
[634:54.82]Thanks, BoxBox.
[634:57.35]You're awesome.
[634:58.21]Thank you.
[635:04.03]Really appreciate that.
[635:06.56]Big Applewood, 500 bits.
[635:10.06]No message.
[635:12.44]A Skadongler gave a thousand bits ten dollars.
[635:15.14]Today we were all told to write down the name of someone who we look up to and put it up on the board at my school.
[635:20.82]I racked my brain for a while and you always ended up on the top of my list.
[635:24.54]We were then told to find a way to thank that person.
[635:26.80]So here I am.
[635:28.44]I honestly think you're the most selfless human being.
[635:31.94]I want to grow up to be as humble and kind as you.
[635:33.88]You're such an inspiring dude.
[635:35.12]Hope you know.
[635:36.64]Love you, JerBear.
[635:38.48]We tease you because we love you.
[635:45.27]that's something I never thought I would ever hear anybody say when I was you know like 16. knowing that that happened is just I hope you're being influenced positively regardless of talking shit around making jokes however you view these streams I really hope that you take something good from here something
[636:17.42]And not everything has to be super duper positive and perfect and fantastic and oh my god, it's so good, everything's perfect, everything's positive.
[636:25.15]But at the end of the day, I really hope you look back on this and you go like, oh, that was actually a really kind of fun time.
[636:33.47]I met some people, met some friends, it was a place to hang out, it was something to watch, something to think was fun, right?
[636:41.33]I hope at the end of the day you do think that.
[636:44.20]I never want to be somebody you look back on and be like, yeah, that sucked.
[636:48.16]That guy sucks.
[636:49.20]That community was dumb.
[636:51.88]So I'm happy that people are not doing that and they're sharing stories like this.
[637:01.03]Thank you so much for the $10.
[637:02.05]It means a lot.
[637:05.87]It really does.
[637:13.69]A Grieco Twitch.
[637:15.35]Thanks for 1,000 bits.
[637:16.23]No message, just 1,000 bits.
[637:17.67]Just $10 deposited into my twitch.tv bank account.
[637:24.62]Bonjour, Tristan.
[637:25.52]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[637:26.24]Hey, Jerma, I just wanted to share an idea I have from watch your streams and VODs while cooking.
[637:30.44]I've been thinking it'd be funny if you did a follow-along cooking vid for a really hard dish.
[637:35.38]Then we could all share our results together in the sub or something.
[637:38.31]Anyways, just a thought, and thanks for the streams.
[637:44.61]Whenever I watch your videos, I pog my pants.
[637:46.95]That's... Thank you.
[637:51.47]There's cooking stuff that's starting to be worked on.
[637:53.91]It's just kind of weird.
[637:57.55]We'll see.
[638:04.38]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[638:05.22]Thanks.
[638:27.03]Thank you.
[638:27.37]I appreciate it.
[638:30.52]Hey, Gondurlain, thanks for the 250.
[638:32.20]Hey, Gerbo, it's been a year since your famous 700,000 game stream.
[638:35.60]I think it's about time you give us a prequel stream, where you stream the games that started it all.
[638:41.50]These are a collection of really shitty games, and these are unique, unlike the 700,000 games by Viva Media.
[638:49.91]It'd be worthy for a fuckface shovelware stream.
[638:54.29]This is called 555 Games XP Championship Edition.
[639:02.20]Alright, fine.
[639:02.68]Yeah.
[639:03.04]I'll buy it.
[639:03.78]I'll buy it right now.
[639:05.88]Alright, yeah.
[639:06.90]Sounds good.
[639:11.27]Hopefully there's a Super Frog in it.
[639:12.49]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Tony Hawk.
[639:19.13]Take care, everybody.
[639:21.07]Two more bits to do.
[639:22.63]I know it's another late one.
[639:23.55]We've done a few late, long streams this week, but remember, I'm not going to be here for almost a full week next week.
[639:31.05]So, I'm happy to do four or five of these long streams in a row.
[639:40.35]I get it.
[639:42.47]I have read countless explanations on Reddit.
[639:46.71]I am a... That's it.
[639:49.55]They trailed off.
[639:53.48]There's nothing there.
[639:55.76]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[639:58.38]Somebody might have clicked on this stream and not played the game and they just get like a TL;DR and the whole game's ruined.
[640:06.12]Cap'n Spurt Dick.
[640:07.87]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[640:09.49]I said the dick part of that so emphasized.
[640:12.77]It's been almost 11 hours.
[640:14.45]Give me just a little slack.
[640:16.71]They just say Jeremy.
[640:20.25]Jeremy.
[640:20.99]Jeremy who?
[640:22.05]Jeremy me?
[640:22.63]Or Jeremy you?
[640:25.28]See you guys tomorrow.
[640:28.06]Have a good night.
[640:29.10]Tony Hawk's Underground.
[640:30.16]Tomorrow.
[640:34.08]Have a good night.
[640:43.37]Thank you.
