[00:07.53]I don't know why you would ever fucking buy this.
[00:09.15]I don't know why you'd ever own one of these.
[00:12.27]It's a... I'm kidding.

[00:58.01]I have a bunch of games.
[01:00.17]We're going to roll through them.
[01:02.41]At least 30 to 40 minutes in each one.
[01:05.05]I have two back-to-back here that I want to start with.
[01:10.45]What's that thing behind you?
[01:11.53]What?
[01:18.43]Let me just grab a water.
[01:20.66]And we'll start in like one and a half to two minutes.
[01:26.76]Be right back in a minute.
[01:31.76]Oh, the first game.
[01:32.38]Let me tell you.
[01:33.88]The first game we're going to play is the Arcade.
[01:38.88]The Pier.
[01:40.18]Pier Arcade.
[01:42.24]Pier Arcade 2.
[01:44.20]I don't even know if the games I even have loaded here.
[01:47.28]It's like a VR arcade simulator.
[01:50.77]It looked interesting.
[01:51.57]I'm going to try it.
[01:52.07]I'll be right back.
[03:59.75]Okay, you guys ready?
[04:03.51]Good.
[04:14.74]That was five minutes?
[04:15.58]That was not five minutes.
[04:16.60]Alright, let me get over here.
[04:22.15]I did, I got a chair.
[04:25.51]So if I need to sit down, I can sit down if I have to.
[04:34.89]Can we get in here?
[04:45.12]Yes.
[04:47.52]Alright.
[04:48.62]Can you guys hear it alright?
[04:49.62]It's a little low for me.
[04:52.80]Uh-oh.
[04:54.94]So this game's got skeeball.
[04:56.96]It's got billiards.
[04:58.81]It's got... I don't know.
[05:03.29]We're about to find out.
[05:05.20]What is the other one?
[05:07.92]Okay, let me get my hand here.
[05:10.87]Make sure I can see all of your lovely faces.
[05:16.37]Which I can.
[05:21.16]Please, I have no idea what you said.
[05:24.16]All I saw was please.
[05:29.71]Okay, this actually has index controls, which is actually pretty cool.
[05:32.99]Alright, press up and aim to teleport.
[05:35.49]Let me get, hold on, my eyes are not in the right place.
[05:38.85]Hope everybody's having a good day.
[05:42.15]Hope you're taking care of yourselves.
[05:43.24]Alright, here we go.
[05:47.72]It's a teleport game, that makes sense.
[05:50.68]It's a VR game, don't do that.
[05:54.40]This is virtual reality, you can't do that.
[06:01.12]Stop jump scaring me.
[06:03.96]Those need to come up very, very slowly.
[06:10.06]Wimp.
[06:11.66]It's scary.
[06:12.94]Alright.
[06:14.36]Does it turn?
[06:16.82]How to snap turn?
[06:17.62]Yeah.
[06:17.88]Okay.
[06:19.67]Sure.
[06:19.79]Alright.
[06:20.01]Alright.
[06:21.95]I'm ready.
[06:24.53]Those got to come up.
[06:25.95]So this is my peripheral right here, right?
[06:29.19]Can you do middle finger?
[06:30.13]Oh, you can.
[06:30.51]Alright, cool.
[06:31.81]So this is my peripheral.
[06:35.02]This has to go like this fast.
[06:39.24]You can't in VR have it be like... It scares the shit out of people.
[06:43.24]Alright, how to grab and throw.
[06:46.81]Squeeze grip to grab and release to throw.
[06:51.47]Squeeze, okay.
[06:54.53]That's pretty fluid.
[06:57.44]That was fluid.
[06:58.42]I'll be honest, that was very fluid.
[07:01.52]Over here?
[07:01.94]Can I do it with the other ones?
[07:06.26]Insert coins?
[07:09.40]Wait, what the hell is this?
[07:10.28]Okay, that's how you put a coin in?
[07:18.65]Why is this... Why is there like a bomb in here?
[07:22.85]Oh, shit.
[07:25.95]Really?
[07:30.44]How's the audio?
[07:31.40]Are we good?
[07:35.26]How's the audio?
[07:37.08]I can't see, so I need to know.
[07:40.16]It's good.
[07:40.54]It's good.
[07:40.78]It's alright.
[07:41.22]It's good.
[07:41.86]It's good.
[07:43.20]Sounds good.
[07:43.73]Freddy Fazbear.
[07:44.85]Alright.
[07:46.45]Jerma, what about capitalism?
[07:48.09]I don't know.
[07:53.35]I don't want ambient sounds in my head.
[07:54.85]Should I smooth turn to help you guys, or is this alright?
[07:59.09]Alright, single player.
[08:03.87]Is there story?
[08:09.57]Okay.
[08:15.49]It looks kind of weird.
[08:16.49]Does it look weird for you?
[08:18.03]It looks kind of weird for me.
[08:22.09]What's this?
[08:24.73]How much money do I have?
[08:27.78]Oh, shit.
[08:28.42]Are you kidding me?
[08:30.22]This is awesome.
[08:31.04]This is like coin game, but I get to actually do it in real life.
[08:34.30]Well, in fake life.
[08:35.46]Alright, let's try it.
[08:41.44]What do I do?
[08:42.00]Oh.
[08:45.02]What?
[08:47.73]What is this song?
[08:51.55]Am I doing it right?
[08:57.63]I got it.
[08:57.97]I got one.
[09:02.00]Turn it.
[09:02.24]Turn, turn.
[09:04.92]Okay, now come up.
[09:07.04]What?
[09:07.24]Alright, bring it down.
[09:15.29]Got one.
[09:19.87]This is too hard.
[09:21.49]This is way too hard.
[09:23.05]I'm just gonna leave this.
[09:23.59]I don't care.
[09:24.14]I'm just leaving it.
[09:25.30]Some five-year-old will come and get a free life.
[09:26.92]I don't care.
[09:28.70]Some ten-year-old could go over there and get a free life.
[09:33.48]Oh, I know this one.
[09:35.94]What do I do?
[09:38.44]I'm just gonna fucking load the goddamn thing up with coins, you know what I mean?
[09:45.99]It's 26 credits.
[09:49.37]I'm gonna be here for a little while.
[09:50.57]Do I have money?
[09:58.00]Where's my money?
[09:58.56]Do I have like a money indicator?
[10:01.56]He's a rich kid.
[10:04.45]Instructions.
[10:05.01]Press the button to swing the crane arm.
[10:08.04]Okay.
[10:13.58]I didn't get any?
[10:22.79]Alright, there's like $30 in here.
[10:31.15]Wait, am I trying to get it...
[10:32.73]Down here or over there?
[10:37.51]Down here, right?
[10:42.58]No.
[10:44.64]There we go.
[10:44.98]That's five.
[10:45.48]I'll take it.
[10:48.06]Oh, there's coins.
[11:02.01]This has zero value to me right now.
[11:04.41]Do you know what I mean?
[11:07.05]If I have 50 attempts and put $100 in here, or $30 in here, there's no risk, there's no reward.
[11:14.86]I don't care.
[11:15.44]There's no stakes.
[11:20.16]I can just do this as many times as I want.
[11:26.52]Go harder.
[11:32.51]Alright, one more.
[11:33.19]I'm gonna get this hand over here.
[11:34.39]Alright, some ten-year-old's gonna be real happy when they come over here.
[11:49.85]Like, you're welcome.
[11:50.91]There's like $30 in there.
[11:51.69]Ooh, I love this one.
[11:56.82]It's me!
[11:57.68]It's me like the tooth fairy of the arcade!
[12:00.04]Like, what am I doing?
[12:07.94]I gotta be, I gotta be much gentler.
[12:11.53]That's, how?
[12:22.84]You know the person that, every time that they're at the arcade, and they play one of these, and they're way too aggressive, and they're way too rough with it, and they go, oh, let me, let me try one!
[12:32.22]Boom, boom!
[12:32.96]And it, like, goes all the way over there.
[12:36.05]These things are designed for you to go like this.
[12:39.29]People that, like, shoot the basketball and they, like, shot put it.
[12:41.75]It's like, dude, relax.
[12:42.81]Just do it gently.
[12:44.04]You don't have to go so hard.
[12:48.98]What?
[12:50.04]He's gone mad.
[12:50.82]That's me?
[12:51.42]No, it's not.
[12:52.10]There you go, kids.
[13:05.10]I'm like paying everybody's parking meters.
[13:08.08]This is stupid.
[13:09.94]I want this as a prize.
[13:13.00]Where am I?
[13:13.64]Can you see me?
[13:16.85]Where am I?
[13:18.17]Can you guys see me?
[13:22.33]Ooh, this one's a rhythm game.
[13:29.56]Hold on a second.
[13:30.82]Wait a minute.
[13:33.10]I have free reign.
[13:34.48]I gotta try to get it on top of that.
[13:35.95]You know what I'm saying?
[13:36.71]I gotta try to ring toss it on the top of this pier thing.
[13:44.46]Come on.
[13:44.92]I'm gonna get it eventually.
[13:55.15]Piece of shit.
[13:56.73]Oh, that was close.
[14:00.41]What am I touching?
[14:00.97]Alright, we're good.
[14:06.55]You couldn't do the ring game?
[14:08.71]See you in an hour.
[14:12.22]Oh my god, it's gonna take so long.
[14:15.02]Stop, just...
[14:25.15]That's the one.
[14:26.59]Whatever, fuck it.
[14:27.27]Who cares?
[14:27.63]I'm getting kicked out.
[14:38.08]I'm gonna get thrown out.
[14:38.88]Alright, what is this one?
[14:43.64]Let me get recombobulated here.
[14:45.58]Okay, there we go.
[14:46.14]Alright, how does this one work?
[14:53.06]I don't get it.
[15:34.53]Am I sure cats not playing right now?
[15:36.59]How long is this?
[16:05.05]Here you go, kid!
[16:08.83]Can I play?
[16:38.46]You can play when I'm done with them!
[16:43.20]Whoa!
[16:50.70]Alright.
[16:53.05]Yeah!
[16:56.41]Alright, the pier.
[16:56.91]We're gonna- Oh, these are- I can buy these prizes!
[16:59.43]What's a frog one?
[17:00.19]I'm so excited for this.
[17:01.77]The Frog Frenzy.
[17:05.23]This is the- This is the game with the alligators!
[17:09.23]Right?
[17:11.37]The one that goes like, ouch!
[17:13.05]Ouch!
[17:13.41]Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
[17:16.13]It's like, we are the alligators and we'll come and... Ouch!
[17:32.24]Oh, don't, what?
[17:42.29]I'm not doing this right.
[17:43.13]There's like two of your friends are here, two of your friends are here, and each of you has one frog or one alligator to deal with, and you get the maximum score possible.
[17:55.76]This is not how this is played.
[18:33.54]I don't care.
[18:34.78]Oh, what's this one?
[18:37.37]Alpha ADHD.
[18:41.85]Oh, I know this one.
[18:42.59]You have to hit the button.
[18:43.23]Really?
[18:43.55]Okay, I'm ready.
[18:44.49]Hit it.
[18:45.25]Hit the fucking button, dude.
[19:03.62]You gotta hit it.
[19:04.34]1, 2, 3, 4.
[19:05.52]1, 2, 3, 4.
[19:06.94]1, 2, 3, 4.
[19:07.48]1, 2, 3, 4.
[19:13.24]I can't hit it fast enough.
[19:22.01]What's this one?
[19:22.53]Ooh, I know this one.
[19:23.13]This one's in every arcade.
[19:28.68]Too much dopamine.
[19:33.93]Okay, here we go.
[19:34.97]I know this one.
[19:36.37]You gotta try to hit all the... You gotta light the whole thing up.
[19:53.42]Come on, come on, almost there.
[19:56.68]Right there, right in the middle.
[19:59.18]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[20:00.52]How much time do we have?
[20:01.24]30 seconds?
[20:03.77]Oh shit, come on.
[20:04.59]There it is!
[20:06.83]Can I get all of them?
[20:11.24]All the greens?
[20:12.60]Oh shit, rainbow.
[20:36.12]18 seconds, I can get it.
[20:40.84]Oh!
[20:41.14]I just moved it!
[20:41.84]That was weird.
[20:42.72]That was like puke inducing.
[20:43.82]That's 35,000 points.
[20:50.52]That's pretty damn good.
[20:53.49]Oh, what's this one?
[21:10.43]Nice, nice.
[21:11.01]Yeah?
[21:12.63]How is it possible to be good at this game?
[21:19.13]That's right.
[21:20.73]All of you should be afraid.
[21:21.93]All of you should be afraid of my power.
[21:25.15]Alright, this is just throw the shit.
[21:30.76]I get it.
[21:46.09]These are the ones where they bounce back.
[22:00.33]I don't even know where that one went.
[22:04.03]What the fu- Whatever, whatever.
[22:05.28]That one's... There's a lot of games in here.
[22:11.26]I didn't expect- What is this?
[22:21.50]Oh shit!
[22:22.12]You can cheat with those rings.
[22:34.91]Oh, I'm not allowed.
[22:35.59]Yes, I am.
[22:44.14]This is such bullshit.
[22:51.04]No, don't.
[22:51.68]There's a wall right here.
[22:52.94]That would have been on the front page of all the Reddits that I've ever been on.
[22:59.61]I was about to just literally baseball pitch this into the wall and go through the wall.
[23:04.15]Thank God for the chaperone.
[23:06.37]Holy shit.
[23:09.76]That would have been awful.
[23:13.22]How many tickets do I have?
[23:16.18]170.
[23:16.22]Alright.
[23:30.87]I mean this is... It's hard to shoot a basketball like this.
[23:35.05]Do I have to use both hands?
[23:48.20]I think I have to use both hands.
[23:56.13]Do it again.
[24:12.65]Shit, now we gotta call the attendant.
[24:16.02]The guy in the shirt has to come over and be like, oh, so you got it up there, huh?
[24:20.72]Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[24:21.98]I don't know what happened.
[24:22.94]I don't know.
[24:27.14]Sorry, sir.
[24:28.24]Sir, I'm sorry, sir.
[24:33.91]I have to get... No, I'm gonna... Don't...
[24:46.22]Don't do that.
[24:52.00]What the fuck?
[24:57.58]This is so embarrassing.
[25:00.60]You can't even do it standing on the edge.
[25:03.79]Oh my god, dude.
[25:07.31]If you saw an adult in here doing this...
[25:16.72]I have to get one.
[25:26.01]Oh my god.
[25:29.01]What the fuck?
[25:31.43]No, do it again.
[25:33.99]Where- I gotta be careful I don't hit a wall.
[25:41.83]Okay.
[25:42.99]Bye.
[25:45.64]Where are you guys?
[25:47.34]Okay, you're over here.
[25:50.01]What's this one?
[25:51.71]Sumo wrestling?
[25:52.35]How does this work?
[26:01.27]What?
[26:02.87]Oh, I have to, like, throw them out.
[26:09.52]Do it.
[26:09.72]200.
[26:10.58]Not the 200.
[26:10.96]200.
[26:10.98]200.
[26:11.00]200.
[26:11.02]200.
[26:11.04]200. 200.
[26:22.23]That's way too much time.
[26:23.09]I don't want to play for that long.
[26:29.54]Oh, nice.
[26:30.02]This is like curling.
[26:30.82]Okay, curling is actually kind of fun.
[26:43.92]Fuck.
[26:44.38]Come on.
[26:47.27]Do it again.
[26:55.46]I let go too early.
[26:58.90]Ugh.
[27:03.78]Shit.
[27:15.33]Come on, it's- why am I going- it's not- I'm not even doing it that hard.
[27:31.49]I swear to god, I'm not doing it that hard.
[27:33.67]Alright, there we go, finally.
[27:55.16]Yes!
[27:55.44]Alright, what else is there?
[28:02.02]How many tickets do I have?
[28:04.96]178.
[28:06.19]What can I buy at the counter?
[28:06.99]Oh, I can get a ball in the cup thing.
[28:13.45]I can get a little ring toss set.
[28:15.61]A dart board.
[28:16.95]What's this little pop gun?
[28:19.79]Let's see.
[28:23.16]Oh, that thing?
[28:23.92]The thing that's at the doctor's office for all the babies?
[28:29.32]Okay, I want...
[28:33.55]How many do I have?
[28:34.47]218.
[28:36.61]Get the cock ring.
[28:41.81]That?
[28:44.93]What?
[28:47.18]Get the cock ring.
[28:49.78]Oh, a little xylophone.
[28:51.88]Oh, I thought I had to confirm it.
[28:53.40]I thought I had to confirm it.
[28:54.32]I just used all my money.
[28:58.62]Oh, give that to me.
[29:28.72]I want the drum.
[29:29.72]Alright, I gotta play.
[29:30.40]What's the best ticket per machine?
[29:33.96]Because I want to get more of these toys.
[29:36.44]I'm not done yet.
[29:37.96]Wait, what's over here?
[29:42.63]Ostrich Run.
[29:44.23]I remember these.
[29:45.33]You gotta put the ball in.
[29:47.79]I'm number one?

[31:00.23]That's a lot.
[31:03.87]This is a two player game.
[31:04.88]Yeah, but I should get tickets, shouldn't I?
[31:09.80]Where are my tickets?
[31:15.12]What kind of arcade machine?

[37:34.15]Oh my god.
[37:40.58]Okay, I guess I'll try it.

[38:09.94]I'm not kidding around.
[38:11.70]I truly mean this.
[38:13.92]I have gone to the arcade where these exist.
[38:17.28]And I'm, I don't know, I'm fucked up.
[38:19.03]You know what I mean?
[38:19.47]Like, I'm so screwed up.
[38:21.29]Like, I will go to one of these coin machines that have the slots like this.
[38:24.65]And I'll get two or three people to all stand at one of these.
[38:27.87]And like, just have like $15 worth.
[38:31.49]And everybody just at the same time is just going like this.
[38:36.47]Until I've run out of fucking money.
[38:43.74]This doesn't... This feels unfair!
[38:48.99]This doesn't feel fair!
[39:05.88]Yeah!

[40:50.45]What?
[40:54.85]Oh, wait.
[40:55.45]I'm doing this kind of wrong.
[41:03.74]It's gotta go down the middle.
[41:04.60]Alright, I need one and two.
[41:07.80]This is... God damn it, this hurts.
[41:12.43]They gotta go down the middle.
[41:18.65]Finish the joke.
[41:21.71]There is no joke.
[41:22.57]I'm just doing... I'm just being a weirdo.
[41:29.09]That's gotta go that way, though.
[41:31.91]Wait, hold on.
[41:32.45]Is that two?
[41:47.00]Alright, two is coming down.
[41:50.63]One, I'm not going to be able to get one.
[41:52.85]Shit, come on.
[41:53.53]At least I'll get the two.
[41:55.73]Alright, there's the two.
[42:02.34]Bingo.
[42:04.04]Guys, here we go.
[42:04.66]I just need the one.
[42:07.95]Alright, just turn my volume down for like 60 seconds.
[42:11.53]Just turn my volume down for 60 seconds, here we go.
[42:23.62]This one right there.
[42:30.05]Got it.
[42:32.07]Let's go.
[42:39.86]What do we got?
[42:42.33]What the fuck?
[42:44.49]What?
[42:45.29]You have to put them in a hole?
[43:14.72]Thank you.
[43:51.31]Yay.
[44:01.75]What's this one?
[44:03.14]This one looks really fun.
[44:03.86]This is the same one.
[44:09.50]Alright.
[44:10.02]Who cares?
[44:10.70]Leave.
[44:13.44]Ooh.
[44:15.66]No.
[44:16.90]Don't you dare do that.
[44:24.71]Okay, so how does this one work?
[44:31.10]Okay.
[44:34.06]This one, I like, this one's really cute.
[44:35.72]It's balls of yarn.
[44:36.76]Alright, let's load it up.
[44:38.44]Ooh.
[44:38.60]Train coming.
[44:56.88]I've played games exactly like this.
[45:04.66]And I'll be honest, if you guys want me to prove to you that I have played a shitload of these, make no mistake about it, I have physical proof of that kind of system.
[45:23.87]Dozens and dozens and dozens of those cards that I just didn't know what to do with.
[45:29.79]If you want me to prove it, I will.
[45:32.71]And it's embarrassing.
[45:36.37]You gotta laugh your ass off.
[45:42.98]Me, Holly, and Etalyx.
[45:47.78]Went to round one.
[45:53.02]If you want to see the proof, I'll show it to you.
[45:58.70]Prove it.
[45:59.42]I swear to God.
[46:06.04]I swear to you.
[46:08.34]Show us now.
[46:08.92]You want to see it right now?
[46:13.24]God damn it.
[46:22.28]Give me a sec.
[46:51.53]It's been a long time since I've been to a cafe, but it's been a long time since I've been to a cafe.
[47:16.34]Let me see.
[47:28.91]Oh my God, this is so embarrassing.
[47:31.57]Okay, you guys ready?
[47:33.61]This is so fucking embarrassing.
[47:35.17]Like, this is bad.
[47:36.93]You're about to think, everyone's gonna think so much lower of me.
[47:42.53]Are you ready to see this shit?
[47:48.09]It's from this machine in round one.
[47:52.65]Okay.
[47:54.48]I'll put the camera a little bigger for this, just because it has to be.
[47:56.74]For those of you that think that I am fucking around, that think this is a big, gigantic, stupid joke, that none of this matters, here's the stack of cards that I have.
[48:11.53]Can you see that?
[48:13.11]Can you see?
[48:14.93]Can you see this?
[48:18.57]This is from a machine at round one.
[48:20.70]It's like 150 cards.
[48:21.66]It's a stack as thick as like an entire collector's box.
[48:30.70]What's this one?
[48:32.66]Oh, from Marble Carnival.
[48:34.56]That's what it is, Marble Carnival.
[48:36.92]I have hundreds probably, at least 50 to 100.
[48:39.46]What do you think?
[48:45.35]This is, here's your proof.
[48:46.13]Just to make sure that I, oh, he must, he, maybe he, like, just got these, like, a bunch of duplicates.
[48:49.77]No.
[48:50.75]No.
[48:52.90]What do you think about that one?
[48:57.10]Interesting, huh?
[49:01.40]I've been this guy a hundred times.
[49:03.22]You're such a weirdo.
[49:04.10]I'm, I tell, I'm telling you the truth.
[49:10.01]Why would we not believe you?
[49:11.17]I don't know.
[49:12.31]People thought I was full of shit for a second.
[49:18.92]Scalping?
[49:21.16]Well, the idea is... Okay, listen.
[49:24.02]The idea with those stupid... And they're fun, okay?
[49:26.90]It was just fun.
[49:27.60]It's just so addicting to just sit there.
[49:32.20]Just cash them out?
[49:34.66]Alright, I gotta get back over here.
[49:40.94]Hold on.
[49:44.64]The whole thing is we couldn't get, we needed one.
[49:48.52]This is how rigged all these things really are.
[49:51.22]So to be able to cash those in, like the full set, you need, I think it's like a set of, come in like a set of 12 or something, or a set of 10.
[50:00.69]And we were missing one.
[50:03.01]out of the probably 70 to 80 times that a car dropped, this one just wouldn't fall.
[50:08.91]So we just have all these duplicates.
[50:10.43]What am I doing with the headset?
[50:15.11]I feel like it's like playing the McDonald's Monopoly game.
[50:19.79]I got like 50 park places.
[50:21.57]Does anybody have a boardwalk?
[50:24.18]We'll be able to get a PlayStation 3 at the ticket counter.
[50:33.33]God, alright.
[50:34.15]I think I messed the eyes up.
[50:34.97]Yeah, I did.
[50:36.59]63, was it what it was?
[50:40.59]Okay, that's good.
[50:45.13]Okay.
[50:46.09]Back to it.
[50:52.15]I had to prove that, though.
[50:53.37]People didn't believe me.
[50:59.18]Do a giveaway.
[51:01.48]Boardwalk was a 1 in 36 million chance.
[51:06.34]I wonder why... And you know, you scope out all the other machines of the same exact one to go, okay, does that have any cats in it?
[51:17.05]Oh, no, I don't see any cats lined up.
[51:18.47]Any cats here?
[51:22.41]Anyways.
[51:24.43]Back to this bullshit.
[51:29.73]Sign them and sell them.
[51:30.85]I don't think I can resell those.
[51:34.23]I don't own the copyrights or whatever.
[51:42.34]Why did my headset get uncomfortable?
[51:44.98]Okay.
[51:50.96]This one doesn't have any cool cards.
[51:52.54]I don't care.
[51:53.30]Alright, let's go do bowling.
[51:55.19]I got 18 stars.
[51:56.25]I can go bowling now.
[51:58.34]Everybody wave goodbye to the coin room.
[52:07.73]I think there's another room down there.
[52:08.79]There's a lot more in this game than I thought there was.
[52:13.09]This is great.
[52:13.85]Yeah, I need 18.
[52:14.65]Okay.
[52:20.23]Second hall.
[52:21.79]DLC hall?
[52:24.77]What?
[52:26.73]DLC hall?
[52:30.64]There's a whole nother hall.
[52:40.95]What?
[52:42.21]Oh my god, there's so much more.
[52:45.21]This is crazy.
[52:46.11]I didn't think it was this big.
[52:48.41]This is awesome.
[52:49.23]Alright, here we go.
[52:51.73]Let's get over here.
[52:52.69]Do I play against the computer?
[53:02.93]Is there anybody to play?
[53:03.53]Oh wait, one player.
[53:04.09]Alright, let's go.
[53:05.63]Whatever, I'm just gonna use my fucking hands.
[53:17.53]Ow!
[53:32.43]Am I standing up?
[53:33.21]What happened?
[53:44.18]I gotta score at least once.
[53:56.95]Let's see if he wins by the time I get back.
[54:07.14]Good luck.
[54:08.84]Alright, we're gonna start over here.
[54:09.70]Ooh.
[54:14.68]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[54:19.84]That was based.
[54:22.01]Thanks.
[54:26.91]What do I do?
[54:51.06]Wait, I have an idea.
[54:57.04]Why does this have detection?
[54:59.16]Wait, what?
[55:00.82]Why does this fire over here?
[55:02.38]This shouldn't be able to fire over here.
[55:06.54]Can I hit that from over here?
[55:07.70]Oh, okay.
[55:09.23]Hold on, I got an idea.
[55:25.98]My head hurts.
[55:36.27]A shark!
[55:40.77]Why do these have collision?
[55:43.21]These shouldn't have collision.
[55:50.13]Is this at a different game?
[55:51.61]Oh shit, hold on.
[55:57.68]Oh, fuck!
[55:58.20]Hold on, wait!
[56:16.51]Oh, fuck your medieval technology!
[56:20.25]I come from the future, you fucking idiots!
[56:33.79]What?
[56:37.50]How do I shoot this?
[56:42.46]Is there an arrow that I'm missing?
[56:50.91]Where's the arrows?
[57:00.85]Where's the... What the hell was that?
[57:04.69]Where's the arrows?
[57:10.19]Insert money?
[57:10.90]Oh!
[57:27.39]Somebody needs to work on the safety practices of this place.
[57:30.47]You can't- I can't be shooting an arrow.
[57:42.13]What about this one?
[58:00.52]This is real!
[58:01.60]It's shooting actual projectiles!
[58:03.45]Can you imagine?
[58:05.91]I was just like... Yeah!
[58:14.41]Look it!
[58:14.79]Uh-oh!
[58:20.64]Accident!
[58:24.32]What's this one?
[58:37.08]Trying to get banned for life.
[58:44.30]This is so weird to control.
[58:45.34]How do you... 200 and... 200,300 points?
[58:54.45]That one's fun.
[59:08.58]Uh, what's this one?
[59:11.40]Oh!
[59:16.85]I... Okay.
[59:32.56]Just once.
[59:32.96]I'm just gonna do it one time.
[59:50.78]Where is it?
[59:51.14]Right there?
[60:06.40]Okay!
[60:08.68]That was a really bad... I don't know if that was Toad or... I don't know what game that was from, but it was a bad impression.
[60:19.80]What's that from?
[60:21.51]Okay.
[60:24.33]It's like, okay.
[60:27.18]Mario Party 1.
[60:30.48]Mario Kart 64.
[60:31.52]Mario Party 64.
[60:31.98]I want you to scrub that.
[60:37.40]That was really awful.
[60:39.64]I could tell because it's pushing on my nose.
[60:42.55]Okay.
[60:44.17]It makes it sound weird.
[60:46.81]And I just committed anyways.
[60:48.77]But I want that scrubbed.
[60:51.98]I did it in two tries.
[60:52.84]I win.
[60:57.06]Wait, they have the sniper game?
[60:58.40]Oh, yeah.
[60:59.02]This one's awesome in the arcade as well.
[61:02.12]I'm actually pretty good at this.
[61:08.39]Bye.
[61:23.78]Everyone that Omega lulled in the... I'm talking.
[61:27.82]Everyone that Omega lulled in the first five seconds, I want them to be timed up for... Never mind.
[61:33.42]They can stay here.
[61:34.54]What?! !
[62:01.24]No tickets, though.
[62:06.09]Sniper.
[62:09.89]This shouldn't atta- oh, just wait.
[62:11.31]Attach these!
[62:24.60]Oh, this hurts.
[62:25.58]Can you guys even see?
[62:29.30]I...
[62:59.43]It's so impossible.
[63:09.19]My neck.
[63:14.24]It's fucking hard to do this, man.
[63:18.54]Because I can't hold it with two hands.
[63:20.10]I can't like put it down either.
[63:31.97]I'm out of bullets.
[63:40.28]Grave gunner!
[63:41.96]Ooh!
[63:43.58]Alright.
[63:55.17]Ooh!
[63:56.61]Got ya!
[63:57.29]In .7 seconds.
[64:10.83]That's not bad.
[64:26.67]Oh, what the?
[64:27.11]I didn't know.
[64:27.49]I thought that was part of the set.
[64:28.51]That would have been such a good one.
[64:30.51]I thought that was part of the set.
[64:34.15]Wait, one more time.
[64:44.93]What the fuck?
[64:47.07]Get away from me.
[65:01.92]Good.
[65:10.79]I'm a pretty good shot.
[65:14.40]If I was in the real one, the real one, I can do pretty good too.
[65:26.50]Ski ball, of course, right?
[65:27.68]Can't skip this one.
[65:30.86]Not gonna skip ski ball.
[65:36.77]Oh shit, I got a lot of tickets.
[65:40.79]Right into the purple.
[65:41.67]You gotta be kidding me.
[65:42.89]First try.
[65:45.65]Alright, I gotta go in the purple?
[65:49.17]It's okay.
[65:52.52]It's alright.
[65:56.68]Ugh.
[65:59.96]Come on, dude.
[66:07.31]Come on.
[66:13.23]I'm being so gentle with it, it's so stupid.
[66:22.75]Or the other side.
[66:27.49]Why is that so hard to do?
[66:28.87]I'm being so gentle.
[66:32.39]500.
[66:39.83]I'm just making sure there's no wall right here.
[66:43.68]There is.
[66:44.96]Just whatever.
[66:45.60]Who cares?
[66:47.44]It's not funny.
[66:49.72]I gotta spin.
[66:50.30]This is kind of creeping up on me here.
[66:53.56]Which way do we need to spin?
[66:54.38]This way?
[66:54.68]I think I gotta go this way.
[66:57.36]I think so.
[67:02.74]Yeah.
[67:04.46]Yeah.
[67:05.26]One more.
[67:05.58]Two more.
[67:08.83]Okay.
[67:09.13]That should be good.
[67:10.37]That's better.
[67:12.43]Do I have enough to go bowling?
[67:15.41]Yep.
[67:20.57]There's one more thing to do here.
[67:23.37]Shock attack.
[67:26.16]I'm pretty damn good at shock attack.
[67:31.06]That's it?
[67:31.36]I just have to feed him?
[67:37.53]Oh no, it's his teeth!
[67:38.77]Okay.
[68:01.21]I have 25 seconds.
[68:01.89]Slow down.
[68:02.25]Fuck.
[68:13.16]Fuck.
[68:31.03]I'll take the tickets.
[68:33.27]Give me the tickets.
[68:37.09]Do I not get these?
[68:37.81]Come on.
[68:40.00]Alright, I got 500 tickets.
[68:41.16]I'm ready to go bowling.
[68:43.64]What do you guys think?
[68:47.14]Stop pretending.
[68:47.90]Do it sidearm.
[68:49.34]He's pretty bad.
[68:52.62]Get the drums.
[68:55.87]Bowling, bowling, bowling, bowling.
[68:57.09]Alright, I'll go... Let me go bowling...
[69:01.96]This game is cool.
[69:03.42]This is pretty fun.
[69:03.96]Alright, bowling is over here.
[69:09.80]There's something over there, too.
[69:10.90]Whatever it is.
[69:12.46]Bowling's all the way down.
[69:13.16]Oh, it's crunching inside of my brain.
[69:28.61]Wow, alright.
[69:30.64]This is pretty sick.
[69:32.60]I'm ready.
[69:38.23]So how does this work?
[69:40.69]Is it like roll?
[69:41.57]I guess it's that easy.
[70:00.16]Oops Oh the speed
[70:25.28]Oh shit!
[70:26.80]Fuck!
[70:28.73]No!
[70:29.49]Play it like a normal human, for God's sake.
[70:32.75]No overhead, yeah.
[70:38.35]Just give me- just start over.
[70:39.37]Give me another one.
[70:41.87]What happened?
[70:42.61]Give me- start over.
[70:51.82]Oh, I'm trying to like just throw it down the middle.
[71:11.17]I can't move.
[71:13.68]Where am I?
[71:13.98]Oh, it's the cord.
[71:16.62]Okay.
[71:20.54]Are we still live?
[71:21.58]Am I not unplugged?
[71:25.91]Or just do it like a normal person and just play.
[71:42.90]Your pants are falling down.
[71:43.98]It's alright.
[71:50.34]Me angry!
[71:52.64]Another caveman joke in VR!
[72:13.81]I'll take these for a minute.
[72:15.27]Wait.
[72:20.03]Wait.
[72:21.85]Wait.
[72:23.59]Oh no.
[72:29.13]Oh no.
[72:37.41]This is not going to end well.
[72:47.12]Okay.
[72:52.42]Get over here.
[72:57.48]It's gonna take a second, but it'll be worth it.
[73:10.29]Stop moving.
[73:20.99]Alright, I think this is enough.
[73:23.03]Maybe one more?
[73:23.93]Two more?
[73:24.67]No!
[73:25.09]Fuck.
[73:25.51]Alright, these two.
[73:25.99]That's it.
[73:31.76]Don't walk into the wall.
[73:34.42]Too immersed.
[73:36.24]Okay, you ready?
[73:50.83]Wow.
[73:53.28]Whoa.
[73:55.08]Whoa, dude.
[73:56.54]I have to leave now.
[73:58.08]That was awful.
[73:59.06]I can't... I didn't get anything.
[74:04.42]Okay.
[74:08.54]Prize counter.
[74:09.14]Let's go.
[74:11.64]What do I have?
[74:14.42]541.
[74:14.44]Dominoes.
[74:16.82]That's kind of cool.
[74:18.88]Rubber band gun?
[74:22.40]The ball in the cup thing?
[74:23.72]That's pretty cool.
[74:25.57]I want the ball in the cup thing.
[74:30.91]No!
[74:31.17]Don't lose it already!
[74:35.61]What?
[74:36.07]Hey!
[74:40.03]I need that.
[74:40.71]Do I have another one?
[74:43.26]Did I just buy another one?
[74:47.56]I did, didn't I?
[74:48.08]Alright, don't...
[75:05.89]Alright, what else?
[75:15.27]What are these little tins?
[75:17.92]Is it airplane?
[75:18.70]Wait, that's a... That one might be cool.
[75:22.78]Blue gun?
[75:23.40]Drum?
[75:25.87]Get a noise maker, get the drum.
[75:28.51]How much is the drum?
[75:29.09]Uh, there's a big frisbee.
[75:39.66]There's a radio.
[75:40.36]What about the horn?
[75:44.76]Is that dynamite?
[75:48.72]Why is it dynamite?
[75:57.73]Okay.
[76:00.41]I need a place to sit down to do this.
[76:07.85]Where did the- Okay.
[76:28.81]I need a flat surface.
[76:30.66]On the ground.
[76:34.32]You guys might not even be able to see me, but whatever.
[76:43.42]This is not what a drum sounds like.
[76:50.12]That's not what a drum sounds like?
[76:59.41]Upside down?
[77:04.93]It's not upside down.
[77:06.33]Everything makes the same sound.
[77:47.78]Gonna hold it like this.
[77:51.02]So you go like... Hey!
[77:56.56]I don't care.
[77:58.54]That didn't even work.
[78:00.24]I've got a hundred... 141.
[78:01.34]How do you shoot the... Oh, it's just an annoying sound maker.
[78:12.54]I don't even want to do it.
[78:13.92]It hurts.
[78:16.39]Why is this just... This is just the sound that the drumsticks were making, but worse and pitched up.
[78:23.07]Oh, I don't want to do it.
[78:26.95]Everybody turn your volume down.
[78:28.09]I mean it.
[78:29.09]I'll turn it down for you.
[78:30.57]Just in case somebody opens this and fucking gets their head blown off from the loud bullshit.
[78:38.31]Do it louder?
[78:38.95]No, I'm not doing it louder.
[78:43.12]Okay, I turned it down.
[78:45.06]Here we go.
[78:58.83]That sounded like I was clipping.
[79:00.32]Like some physics was clipping into a wall.
[79:04.70]Yeah, Gary's mod prop collision.
[79:06.46]Exactly, yeah.
[79:11.43]That's too loud now.
[79:12.39]Excuse me.
[79:16.07]I think we've seen pretty much everything I want to see in this game.
[79:18.07]It was fun.
[79:21.60]I think we can move on to the next one.
[79:24.03]I got a lot of random shit.
[79:25.15]I'm just going to kind of open something.
[79:27.03]But I'm going to take this opportunity to... Wait, what's this?
[79:30.67]Wait.
[79:35.46]Wait.
[79:37.52]Wait.
[79:38.14]Wait.
[80:02.17]My brain is so weird.
[80:03.31]I thought this was a guy hanging upside down.
[80:08.37]Why is it moving already?
[80:09.49]Why is it alive?
[80:13.16]Why are they moving?
[80:14.34]Why are they moving in here?
[80:18.66]I don't like that.
[80:19.40]That was really weird.
[80:42.49]Damn it.
[80:43.84]I have to get the monkey, you're right.
[80:44.88]This is so cursed, please get away from this.
[80:51.78]How do I get this game?
[80:52.90]This game is called Pier Arcade 2.
[80:55.68]It's a VR game.
[81:03.04]I play a lot of coin games, so I figured I have to play this one.
[81:06.22]I'm thinking right there.
[81:09.08]That looks alright.
[81:11.49]What do you guys think?
[81:13.73]That looks alright.
[81:16.25]Get it right by the base of the head.
[81:17.37]Kind of around the neck.
[81:21.45]There it is, see?
[81:21.91]Right around the neck.
[81:24.18]Oh, what was the swing?
[81:25.40]That was stupid.
[81:27.36]Is this underwater?
[81:31.07]Please get a parrot.
[81:32.13]I gotta get the monkey.
[81:32.87]I can't scrap it.
[81:34.09]Too much motion, it's moving too much.
[81:38.51]Nah, too much motion.
[81:59.28]I'm gonna get him around.
[81:59.96]Wait, that actually might be kind of good.
[82:26.91]What?
[82:27.13]Is it a bungee jump?
[82:29.21]What was that?
[82:29.97]Why did it do that?
[82:34.45]What was that shit?
[82:35.53]That was unbelievable.
[82:40.14]It's not a bungee cord.
[82:41.52]Alright, keep moving.
[82:48.18]That's not it.
[83:10.97]There we go.
[83:11.35]Right around the neck and the head.
[83:13.07]Pick it up.
[83:15.03]Move it that way.
[83:19.01]I don't know if I can get this thing.
[83:21.52]Please turn the music off.
[83:23.54]Stick your head in there and see if you can just grab it.
[83:27.01]Nope.
[83:27.59]The game, like, pushes it away.
[83:29.39]I tried doing this, but like, this doesn't work.
[83:33.94]I can't.
[83:35.64]It doesn't work.
[83:37.84]That's it.
[83:44.08]That's it.
[83:45.16]I wanna see pogs in the chat.
[84:00.43]Stop, I'm not doing that.
[84:06.86]Why is it shaking around so much?
[84:10.78]Stop.
[84:13.12]Okay, I'm not touching that anymore.
[84:16.00]What are the other ones?
[84:17.56]There's balls, there's cows, there's zombies.
[84:23.21]Ooh, I kind of want one of these stars.
[84:31.92]Where am I?
[84:32.48]I'm scared I'm going to run into something.
[84:38.98]That was weird.
[84:45.61]I can't take this music anymore.
[84:46.55]I'm gone.
[84:48.11]Wait!
[84:48.49]I can't pick up my friend.
[84:49.25]Huh?
[85:02.18]Oh well.
[85:04.70]Trophies.
[85:05.22]Bowling trophies, I'm assuming.
[85:14.35]Fantastic flush.
[85:20.69]That is... Alright.
[85:27.96]It's time to move on to the next game.
[85:29.96]But let me buy a soda first.
[85:32.47]This was cute.
[85:32.93]I like this.
[85:33.27]This was really fun.
[85:36.29]Free drinks for everybody.
[85:40.30]How about a Max Go?
[85:56.87]How much is in here?
[86:02.24]There's a lot in this can.
[86:05.20]There's so much in here.
[86:08.04]It's infinite.
[86:23.13]Quick!
[86:24.93]Before they get what happened, take them!
[86:27.87]Wait, why is there yo-yos in here?
[86:31.15]What?
[86:41.90]Hey kids!
[86:43.92]Soda!
[86:50.29]Nobody move.
[86:56.97]Nobody move.
[86:58.90]I'm gonna crash myself out of this one.
[87:17.70]Anybody thirsty?
[87:35.16]We have to keep going.
[87:36.36]How many cans are in this thing?
[87:40.32]Aye!
[87:40.54]I'm sorry, who are you?
[87:43.74]I gotta go double.
[87:51.91]Somebody tell me when it's been... Alright, I need you guys to count collectively to 60 seconds.
[87:58.61]And tell me when it's been 60 seconds.
[88:25.87]It's been 30, okay.
[88:38.96]45.
[88:41.34]My fingers are getting kind of tired.
[88:47.88]Okay, here we go.
[88:51.02]How am I gonna?
[88:54.79]We're gonna have to do it one at a time?
[88:56.13]No!
[89:16.99]Oh no!
[89:18.95]This is gonna get out of control really quick.
[89:20.81]Alright, how long do you think the 39 is gonna handle this?
[89:26.32]Okay, do you think I can fill the whole restaurant with these?
[89:28.70]Do you think I can fill the entire fucking restaurant with these?
[89:32.60]Alright, just give me a minute.
[89:36.73]I at least want to get him to be like 10 feet tall.
[89:40.69]Wait, there's another one over there too.
[89:43.61]This looks like... This looks like somebody took a baseball bat to the soda section in the grocery store.
[89:52.49]This is fucked up.
[89:54.44]Alright, I'm in for the long haul.
[89:56.22]I don't care how long this takes.
[89:57.38]I'm probably going to lose 5,000 viewers.
[90:00.30]This is a scientific approach to see how powerful the 3090 is.
[90:08.26]This is a project now, and it has to happen.
[90:11.94]I'm going to have to... Alright, I'm going to do this for five straight minutes.
[90:19.02]Just here's what you can do.
[90:19.96]Ready?
[90:21.38]Go open up another tab.
[90:23.04]Okay?
[90:24.00]Open up another tab.
[90:24.98]Like, maybe there's another stream going on that maybe you want to go check out.
[90:28.48]Open up another tab.
[90:29.20]Maybe some music.
[90:30.00]Maybe do some, like, work that you've had going on.
[90:33.24]And just, like, kind of come back in five minutes.
[90:34.82]I'm going to be doing the same exact fucking motion.
[90:38.11]I'm going to do it for five straight minutes.
[90:40.49]So, like, just go relax.
[90:42.69]Maybe go take a break.
[90:43.67]I'll be here.
[90:44.61]I'll be here.
[90:47.07]And I'll see you in five minutes.
[90:55.87]Just turn the- Just mute the stream, too.
[90:57.45]Like, you don't need to hear this.
[91:21.35]Somebody- You gotta let me know when it's been five minutes, though.
[91:37.30]Just an agent of chaos.
[91:43.68]This is so stupid.
[91:53.85]Nobody tell him.
[91:55.55]What?
[91:57.69]Nobody tell him?
[91:59.09]Tell me what?
[92:03.30]You gotta go faster.
[92:04.38]It's been one minute.
[92:05.02]Okay.
[92:18.79]I'm not going to need to do any wrist workouts for the next two years.
[92:24.55]And all my stamina is going to be gone for the rest of the day.
[92:27.17]Am I going to be able to even play?
[92:28.63]Okay, if I need to play a VR game that has a shooting mechanic, I'm not going to be able to do it.
[92:46.93]Don't tell him.
[92:47.69]Lacks critical information.
[92:49.07]Huh?
[92:55.67]Don't.
[92:55.97]He doesn't know.
[92:56.71]What if I don't?
[92:57.61]No, you gotta tell me.
[92:58.25]He's unaware.
[93:05.03]Keep going.
[93:21.82]Okay, I'm starting to lose my mind How long has it been?
[93:44.61]Two and a half minutes?
[93:47.38]They cap out Where do you see that?
[93:50.68]That says 0-0, man.
[94:01.21]Where do you see that it caps out?
[94:05.93]They're de-spawning?
[94:06.85]No, they are not.
[94:07.57]They're all still here.
[94:14.93]We're four minutes in.
[94:24.67]They're making shit up, alright.
[94:40.36]Okay, one minute left.
[94:58.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[94:59.89]30 seconds.
[95:21.66]Here we go.
[95:44.56]It's starting to lag.
[95:58.09]It's starting to lag out.
[95:59.87]I'm starting to get sick, I think.
[96:02.41]I'm gonna get sick.
[96:04.03]I'm at like 20 frames a second.
[96:08.36]Oh god, it's getting sick!
[96:14.08]Okay.
[96:15.84]Oh boy.
[96:17.84]Oh boy.
[96:19.34]Oh boy.
[96:19.90]I think I've gone too far.
[96:36.28]Okay.
[96:38.72]There is... I can't touch that.
[96:43.19]I can't touch that.
[96:48.26]Yeah, I was going to just say, jump into it like a pile of leaves.
[96:52.82]I was going to say the same thing.
[96:53.96]Oh, alright.
[97:00.15]This, I have to say a very fair warning here.
[97:03.97]This is going to make you sick.
[97:05.71]It's starting, the motion is starting to get fucked up.
[97:08.97]So just be aware of that.
[97:10.30]It actually might make you a little sick.
[97:12.52]So just kind of maybe minimize the window a little bit.
[97:16.49]Don't look at it head on.
[97:38.15]There's so many more in here.
[97:50.56]Wait, do I have anything heavy that I can throw over here like a chair?
[97:59.70]Oh, local weather says we're going to get two feet of cans today.
[98:03.07]Make sure you wear your make sure you wear your good boots.
[98:16.21]Oh, God.
[98:17.49]Fuck.
[98:26.65]Uh-oh.
[98:32.25]Uh-oh.
[99:00.18]Open what?
[99:02.44]Jump into the pile.
[99:03.44]Oh!
[99:06.50]No, it's gonna break.
[99:09.94]I'm trying to move very, very slowly and steadily because I know it's gonna be motion sick for a lot of you guys.
[99:16.37]The end game here is I'm gonna go get a really heavy object and I'm gonna throw it over here.
[99:27.35]Oh, Jesus, man.
[99:28.99]Okay.
[99:34.26]so so so
[99:57.13]This one's done.
[100:32.17]Oy yi yi, holy shit.
[100:35.45]Oh my god.
[100:38.27]Does that, okay, does anyone remember the old Jerry Lewis movies?
[100:43.64]There was a scene where Jerry Lewis was like, he always used to run into shit and crash and stuff would break.
[100:52.06]And this exact thing, he like runs into a giant display of soda cans or something in one of his movies.
[100:57.26]He was like a wacky guy.
[100:58.23]He was kind of like Jim Carrey before Jim Carrey.
[101:01.83]And, like, this is what the aftermath would be.
[101:04.23]I want to see what this looks like from far away.
[101:07.11]Oh my god.
[101:19.96]That just looks so awful.
[101:21.28]Alright.
[101:23.78]I think I'm actually going to crash my whole computer.
[101:26.07]Let me just tell you, if my stream turns off, that means my computer probably fried.
[101:30.29]So, just be aware of that.
[101:34.92]These are heavy.
[101:43.66]Oh, goodness.
[101:44.42]Here we go.
[101:45.88]Can you grab a bench?
[101:47.28]Wait, can I grab one of these chairs?
[101:50.39]No, you can't.
[101:52.63]Here we go.
[101:53.37]One, two, three.
[101:59.33]Not heavy enough.
[101:59.81]Uh-oh.
[102:10.53]Um... You need to get some... The FPS is going down.
[102:17.06]Yeah.
[102:18.38]A bowling ball.
[102:20.72]I don't... I can't bring a bowling ball out here.
[102:23.72]They despawn at the door.
[102:27.64]Shit.
[102:33.16]Shoot at it?
[102:33.68]What about the drum?
[102:34.72]Throw the drum.
[102:35.96]Alright.
[102:36.28]I hope they don't despawn.
[102:40.27]No, they're definitely still there.
[102:41.25]The whole game feels like it's underwater right now.
[102:44.76]I don't think they're gonna despawn.
[102:54.80]Hey, wait, wait, whoa, whoa!
[102:56.59]Did you hear that?
[103:00.33]That was a drum sound.
[103:06.05]You heard that, right?
[103:07.93]You need to get the dynamite.
[103:13.08]You're just trying to break my computer.
[103:17.66]I mean, you're trying to break my computer, but I'm for it.
[103:20.53]How much is the dynamite?
[103:25.81]500?
[103:26.15]Where can I get 500 tickets quick?
[103:37.34]The coin pusher?
[103:38.04]I don't want to leave this area.
[103:43.56]Just steal it.
[103:44.85]The sumo game does it well?
[103:46.03]Okay.
[103:56.29]Still don't understand how the sumo game works.
[103:57.51]You have to pick up balls and toss them in.
[104:04.24]Alright, not bad.
[104:13.30]What if it goes in that one?
[104:15.32]Did I just lose points?
[104:16.10]Nice.
[104:19.53]No!
[104:19.71]No!
[104:49.11]Times one.
[104:49.73]Shit.
[104:50.19]This is a long time.
[105:03.29]Is this worth it?
[105:04.19]15 seconds.
[105:19.80]Alright, times five.
[105:21.59]500?
[105:27.77]Oh, alright.
[105:32.92]Let's go.
[105:33.66]How much?
[105:40.08]Pick them up!
[105:40.50]This is bullshit!
[105:42.89]There were only 70 tickets!
[105:49.23]They did not despawn.
[105:51.89]Okay.
[105:53.27]500.
[105:53.57]70 is a lot.
[105:59.41]I need more tickets though.
[106:02.50]Something that'll give me more than that.
[106:04.68]That takes too long.
[106:05.36]Maybe one of these?
[106:11.42]Oh, this.
[106:19.51]If I just spam it, and who cares about the timer, I wonder how much I get.
[106:21.97]Alright, I just ran out.
[106:30.10]How much did I get for 34?
[106:36.94]This is way, way better.
[106:38.35]Like a million times better.
[106:40.05]Just keep doing it.
[106:57.06]Good.
[106:58.70]Please stop.
[106:59.14]It hurts my eyes.
[107:00.02]I'm sorry.
[107:00.60]I know.
[107:00.84]We're almost done.
[107:03.06]I'm throwing the dynamite over there and then my computer's gonna crash and then I'll see you in like a week.
[107:08.63]I'm trying just to keep like my head down.
[107:11.89]I'm just gonna keep my head here.
[107:13.07]Good.
[107:13.77]Again.
[107:32.18]Again.
[107:32.48]Okay.
[107:33.46]Almost there.
[107:33.84]Halfway there.
[107:34.24]Good.
[107:34.58]Come on.
[107:35.18]You're just grinding in RuneScape.
[107:36.90]It won't take that long.
[108:06.52]Can I skip this and get the tickets?
[108:09.18]Okay, yup.
[108:09.50]Almost there.
[108:10.12]Check on the cans.
[108:11.18]Oh, they're still there, alright.
[108:34.82]I wonder what temperature my GPU is at right now.
[108:36.89]Probably like 110.
[108:42.09]What's the highest that a 3090 can go without like exploding?
[108:47.48]You know what the funniest part about me having a 3090 is?
[108:51.62]So I get a 3090 and...
[109:03.87]I don't play any games on it, really.
[109:06.94]I play, like, fucking Fart Simulator 2013 a few times.
[109:10.58]A couple of 2D games.
[109:12.26]And then I try to break it with overloading it in VR.
[109:16.32]Why do I have this?
[109:23.99]At this point, I'd probably be better off with, like, on-board graphics.
[109:30.23]Alright, we're almost there.
[109:32.25]We are at 345.
[109:33.49]We have to do this like three or four more times.
[109:35.01]I promise we're almost done.
[109:35.94]I'm gonna take a break after this too.
[109:38.10]Get some water.
[109:39.28]We'll come back and play another game. 379.
[109:59.91]Okay, I got 40.
[110:00.39]Let's see if that, what's that, what's that, what's that?
[110:03.47]379.
[110:03.49]Alright, I'm gonna go 40 again.
[110:33.11]Alright, 44.
[110:36.53]Nothing but net.
[110:39.47]You're going to blow on your computer.
[110:43.44]Last one.
[110:44.36]This is it.
[110:45.76]And then I'm going to leave this game.
[110:47.30]Alright.
[110:48.46]This is where it all comes down to it.
[110:50.46]This is it.
[111:06.87]500.
[111:08.23]Slowly gonna make myself over here.
[111:12.27]There they are.
[111:15.41]Okay.
[111:16.70]How does this work?
[111:19.28]How do these work?
[111:23.74]How does this, how do I turn this on?
[111:26.80]I hear a lighter?
[111:36.89]How do I use this?
[111:43.78]Go to the cans.
[111:47.50]They're still there, don't worry.
[111:49.22]How do I do this?
[111:58.97]Do these do anything?
[112:05.55]It's a flute?! !
[112:08.77]No, it isn't.
[112:09.71]It's not a flute.
[112:11.47]Throw it.
[112:18.27]That's just cosmetic?
[112:19.39]It can't be.
[112:23.67]I have to, like, flick it on something.
[112:28.47]I need a lighter.
[112:29.07]Where would I get a lighter?
[112:30.11]My hands are purple.
[112:33.35]I don't get it.
[112:35.19]Don't start them.
[112:37.26]It's a flute.
[112:37.96]It's not a flute!
[112:40.66]That's a wick right there.
[112:45.62]Look for a lighter prize.
[112:48.12]They're not gonna sell a lighter at this arcade.
[112:50.62]Huh?
[112:59.13]Oh, fuck you!
[113:00.65]It's 250 tickets!
[113:08.18]I lost the hand.
[113:08.88]Oh my god.
[113:09.64]Okay, come on.
[113:10.40]I don't even care anymore.
[113:13.12]I'm about to just leave the game.
[113:37.80]I'm losing tracking on- I think the VR is starting to crash.
[113:45.62]Yep.
[113:47.82]Oh yeah.
[113:48.70]This is bad.
[113:50.18]Oh boy.
[113:50.52]Oh boy.
[113:53.81]The left hand is not having a good time.
[114:00.49]I gotta do it for science!
[114:01.81]For scientific purposes!
[114:12.27]What if my stream turns off?
[114:13.21]That sucks.
[114:15.61]This would have been such a huge... Okay.
[115:07.92]What's going on with the music?
[115:10.80]Did you hear that?
[115:11.40]Last one.
[115:12.10]Okay, come on.
[115:13.32]That's it.
[115:13.90]I'm done.
[115:14.42]I'm done.
[115:14.74]Get me out of here.
[115:38.38]250, get out.
[115:41.89]Oh my... Fuck you!
[115:47.01]I can't even press the button!
[115:48.11]I only got 12!
[115:49.25]Gerber's destroying the metaverse.
[116:05.33]My God, dude.
[116:07.19]This is it.
[116:07.65]This is the last one.
[116:08.37]Just go.
[116:13.04]Why are they all missing?
[116:16.60]Excuse me.
[116:18.64]Excuse me.
[116:19.38]I got four.
[116:21.20]How is it possible?
[116:31.03]Something's wrong.
[116:31.67]They're coming out of the machine.
[116:34.68]Do you understand?
[116:35.41]Like something's wrong with this.
[116:37.27]Something's wrong here.
[116:38.93]The metaverse is breaking.
[116:40.99]I drank too many sodas.
[116:51.56]Is that enough?
[117:06.75]I gotta get out of here now.
[117:07.97]I gotta get out of here now.
[117:09.01]I gotta stop freaking out.
[117:10.41]Okay, I'm done.
[117:14.95]I'm done.
[117:15.37]I'm done.
[117:15.63]I'm done.
[117:20.61]Go.
[117:20.95]Get the fuck out now.
[117:22.28]Get out.
[117:23.36]Get out.
[117:39.10]God You guys ready um here we go oh Shit oh shit.
[117:53.81]This is bad actually be careful.
[117:55.59]This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.
[117:57.15]I'm not kidding oh
[118:22.13]Alright, I'm gonna take a quick break.
[118:26.61]I'm gonna get some water, use the drum.
[118:35.29]Alright, I'll use the drum.
[118:36.79]And then I'm out.
[118:37.85]I'm going to get a drink of water.
[118:46.94]What is the... Okay, wait.
[118:48.50]Hey, VRJosh, what does purple hands mean?
[118:51.71]Because they weren't purple before.
[118:56.31]Nope, nope, nope.
[118:57.17]Honest to God, don't look at that.
[119:03.93]Nope, I ain't doing that.
[119:05.05]That's going to cause motion sickness for sure.
[119:08.69]Nope.
[119:11.71]No.
[119:12.85]Nope.
[119:14.53]I'm not going to cause motion sickness for everybody.
[119:22.18]Drama.
[119:25.52]Purple means what?
[119:31.02]Move your hands around.
[119:34.94]Did everybody close their eyes?
[119:38.04]Let me see what temperature my GPU is at right now.
[119:47.95]No, I'm just leaving it.
[119:50.03]I'll be right back.
[119:50.89]We're gonna open up another game.
[119:52.11]I have to bring my computer's CPU down to like at least 10 degrees.
[119:57.20]I'll be right back.
[120:12.04]Somebody said, wait, crash it, you idiot.
[120:13.70]Alright.
[120:17.22]I'm gonna give a really strong warning here.
[120:21.36]Strong warning.
[120:24.38]This is about to be unbearable to look at.
[120:26.74]I'm not kidding.
[120:27.79]If you're sensitive to motion sickness and flashing shit, this is gonna happen.
[120:32.65]Be careful.
[120:33.29]I'm dead serious.
[120:34.63]If you don't think we can handle it, then I'm serious.
[120:36.85]Be careful.
[120:38.35]I'm gonna drag the drum around
[120:42.50]I'm serious, this is gonna be very, very painful to look at.
[120:45.61]Please be smart about this.
[120:47.65]Here we go.
[121:10.70]And that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so.
[121:17.24]I'll be back.
[121:25.83]I'll be back.
[121:31.73]Dan didn't crash.
[121:32.50]It's okay.
[121:34.32]I'll see you guys in two minutes.
[121:44.88]Thank you.
[126:31.87]okay turn this down probably gonna be loud you tell me tell me how loud this is how is that what the hell is the name of this game I forget the name of this game I think it's called legendary tales called legendary tales
[127:03.96]I'm quiet.
[127:04.32]Yeah, I'll be loud when I put this back on.
[127:09.97]Volume is low.
[127:10.87]Yeah, once I get in the headset, it'll be fine.
[127:13.09]Don't worry.
[127:19.62]Not played either the last game or this one.
[127:22.14]Really?
[127:22.60]Okay.
[127:27.77]Yeah, alright.
[127:29.65]Am I still quiet?
[127:30.39]Because this is me with the headset on.
[127:32.11]Probably not.
[127:33.69]I'm ready.
[127:33.99]Let's do it.
[127:35.99]This is called Legendary Tales.
[127:47.11]How you doing?
[127:47.45]This is like a sword and magic and skeletons game.
[127:57.40]When are you gonna play Among Us VR?
[127:59.74]Oh, maybe next time.
[128:00.36]Okay.
[128:04.02]I'm gonna have to do some calibration.
[128:14.50]Susguy plays Among Us VR.
[128:16.20]50,000 viewers.
[128:22.26]And I have to have the sus image at the top right of the screen the whole time, right?
[128:35.60]Like, I don't even have a facecam.
[128:36.88]It's just the sus cam.
[128:40.74]Let me get in the right spot.
[128:45.78]Okay, we're back.
[128:47.20]We're good.
[128:47.92]I think the GPU is fine.
[128:51.92]That's a catastrophic event.
[128:53.42]The gravitational pull is going to probably be bad, right?
[128:55.72]Alright, calibration.
[128:58.90]Spread out your arms in a T pose.
[129:00.96]Press the trigger button, then move your hands down by your sides.
[129:21.19]What the fuck?
[129:23.61]Okay.
[129:26.25]Your current controller is not the Oculus, it's the Index.
[129:44.48]It works!
[129:50.84]So he said, yikes.
[129:52.26]Alright, tutorial.
[129:56.08]Oh, this is a lot of info.
[129:58.68]Um, okay.
[130:02.78]What?
[130:07.98]Legendary tales.
[130:12.78]Come over here.
[130:17.43]Ow.
[130:21.83]How do I do that?
[130:23.78]Oh, I can just walk.
[130:26.16]Point your hand.
[130:29.36]Welcome to Legendary Tales.
[130:30.64]I am a guiding wisp that will teach you about the features of Legendary Tales.
[130:34.94]The basic controls are shown on the side.
[130:38.46]Left trackpad.
[130:39.60]Move, press left trackpad.
[130:41.26]Right, run, trackpad.
[130:42.62]I just read that like a fucking weirdo.
[130:46.70]Okay, run, right trackpad, turn?
[130:53.68]I mean, yeah, it's just the movement.
[130:59.74]Okay, two-handed grip.
[131:01.62]Stop it.
[131:02.92]Two-handed grip at changing hand position.
[131:05.31]You can change the position of your hand on the weapon by holding it.
[131:08.51]Grab the weapon with both hands.
[131:10.59]Try moving one of your hands along the weapon by holding the indicated button.
[131:15.37]Rip.
[131:20.02]Wait, what?
[131:25.37]Okay.
[131:27.27]Trigger, grab weapon, trackpad, change hand position.
[131:39.03]What?
[131:40.33]Trackpad's a little thumb thing, right?
[131:52.18]Oh, okay, I see.
[131:57.79]That's kind of weird though.
[131:59.11]That feels weird.
[131:59.79]I can't like... Point your hand.
[132:06.10]Add a holster.
[132:08.30]Get out of here.
[132:09.70]There are a total of three holsters on your body.
[132:12.24]One on each side of your hip and one at the base of your spine.
[132:16.22]Put the shield in the back holster and the sword in one of the side holsters.
[132:30.54]What?

[132:49.59]Ooh!
[132:50.91]Okay, cool.
[132:52.73]Items can be moved directly from the field.
[132:56.86]Stop doing that.
[132:59.98]Move your hand over the items so the status window appears and use the key shown at the side and the item will be automatically added.
[133:10.84]B?

[135:28.88]What?
[135:41.00]Can I pick this up?
[135:43.34]How to use item crystals.
[135:45.12]When you kill an enemy or destroy an object, a crystal may appear in the treasure chest.
[135:49.34]If you attack, throw, or crush the item, it'll be destroyed and a random item will be dropped there.
[135:53.13]Try using different item crystals.
[136:01.18]Oh, shit!
[136:03.42]What is this?
[136:08.94]Oh!
[136:14.53]Cool, alright.

[140:28.60]Skyrim Dungeon?
[140:33.06]There are three types of attacking weapons slashing piercing and bludgeoning slashing is done with the blade Piercing is done with point bludgeoning is using the blunt each weapon has a different damage multiplier for different parts Compare the damage by performing different attack types or the weapon provided, okay?
[140:49.07]That was good to me Let's try it This feels like it's gonna be fun
[141:09.35]It's fun.
[141:10.97]I just want to play it.
[141:13.33]Light attacks.
[141:14.64]Yeah, yeah.

[142:46.82]You're gonna shoot your eye out.
[142:48.00]I'll be fine.
[142:52.93]Defense.
[142:54.37]Yes, with shields you can defend.
[142:57.45]Who would have guessed?
[143:10.64]I don't have a shield anymore.
[143:12.32]When an enemy is attacking, knocking into the enemy's weapon will knock it away, and you can parry.
[143:31.16]Ooh!
[143:38.20]Now, let me jam it into his head.
[143:40.61]Parrying.
[143:41.03]When an enemy is attacking, you can hard parry them by hitting them at high speed.
[143:46.83]Uh-huh.
[143:49.87]I can't understand this side.
[143:51.33]Go like that way, maybe?
[143:54.39]I got it.

[146:14.40]Select the fire arrow.
[146:19.84]What?
[146:22.90]Okay.
[146:27.13]When charging is complete, thrust your hand forward.
[146:32.33]That didn't do it.
[146:33.17]Is that going behind me?
[146:41.14]That's not working.
[146:47.00]It's a blowtorch?
[146:48.30]You can combine spells, fusion magic.
[146:50.52]Alright.
[146:52.40]We're almost going to play the game, I promise you.
[146:55.91]Don't you guys remember the rule of thumb?
[146:58.59]I've said this a hundred times.
[147:00.85]Every VR game is just a tutorial.
[147:04.79]You just, like, hey, by the way, your fingers can go like this.
[147:08.78]All of them do this.
[147:09.80]All of them.
[147:12.63]Make sure you put your hand down here.
[147:15.13]Try it.
[147:20.31]I mean, there are some lots of things in this game that you have to know, I get it.
[147:24.15]Alright, fusion magic.
[147:28.89]You need to, alright, what are you saying?
[147:32.45]Use fusion magic, you must learn the spell it is made from as well as the fused version.
[147:35.65]You will also need to place it in a fusion magic slot along the bottom.
[147:39.82]So if I go like this
[147:42.88]And I- can I like put it down here?
[147:44.36]What does the video say?
[147:49.09]Alright, he's like- I have to learn whatever this is.
[147:51.35]Ice arrow?
[147:51.79]What does it want me to learn?
[147:54.33]Acquire the fused magic lava axe.
[147:59.29]What the fuck?
[148:04.52]Okay, so where's this- where's- a lava axe?
[148:09.26]Okay.

[149:20.72]Fire axe.
[149:22.18]Can I not put it up here?

[150:50.53]Okay.
[150:51.01]Fill your HP potion.
[150:53.27]Try filling up the HP potion.
[150:54.59]It takes several recovery orbs.
[150:55.83]Why did I even do the tutorial?
[150:56.87]I probably could have just been fine.
[151:00.19]So, fill one.
[151:01.87]Alright, so that's how you fill up potions.
[151:04.11]You currently have very low health.
[151:05.07]Use the previous potion to go to open in B. Press right B. Use stored potion.
[151:08.52]Is that what I just did?
[151:11.52]Press top right trackpad.
[151:12.54]Open inventory.
[151:12.98]Change potion type.
[151:19.00]I need to leave the game now.

[151:48.73]Take the weapon and shield and hit B. Press down on the right stick.
[151:58.17]Now acquire all the orbs while your hands are full.
[152:16.83]Alright, you know when you go into like a Disney ride, and they play the video before you get on the ride?
[152:23.26]And the video to get on the ride is like 20 minutes sometimes, and the ride's like 15 fucking seconds.

[159:12.39]Alright, we finally got enemies to fight.
[159:35.84]Does somebody already play this level?
[159:39.32]I feel like somebody played this already.
[159:57.30]I kind of don't like the health meter.
[160:08.45]It's fun.
[160:10.37]It's fun, I'll tell you.
[160:16.95]Items.
[160:28.86]It's fun.
[160:29.50]ResidentSleeper.
[160:35.34]I'm not gonna read any of those.
[160:36.20]I already know what to do.
[160:39.00]Shield.
[160:39.50]I'll take it.
[160:57.19]Nice.
[161:10.37]Ooh, gimme.
[161:13.88]What's up?
[161:14.62]Oh, what's that?
[161:15.40]Something small?
[161:16.44]What's the difference?
[161:16.88]Three to five.
[161:20.12]What is it?
[161:23.00]Yep, this is short as well.
[161:24.36]Look at that.
[161:32.95]Nice.
[161:33.23]What is this?
[161:38.68]Oh, it's even smaller.
[161:43.52]Come on.
[161:53.13]Three to five.
[161:53.83]This one's smaller.
[161:54.39]I'll take it.
[162:01.52]Yep.
[162:05.56]Why is he swinging so wildly?
[162:07.00]I'm not swinging wildly.
[162:08.26]It's finesse.
[162:11.69]Think about how many times I just hit you.
[162:14.00]That was like seven times in a second.
[162:19.97]You'd be carved up like a Christmas turkey.
[162:26.37]Okay, let's keep going.
[162:33.33]Why is he still playing Dizzy Bird?
[162:44.02]I got a lot of mana potions.
[162:47.00]I don't care.
[162:55.99]Ooh, I can buy this.
[162:57.81]How good is that?
[163:00.71]So this one is two to five, three to five, three to six.
[163:08.10]No, I think I got better stuff.
[163:23.50]I finish and move.
[163:30.90]Hey!
[163:33.34]Oh.
[163:38.20]Why would I throw my- Oh, he hit me right in the face!
[163:41.60]Oh, shit!
[163:42.04]What happened to my sword?
[163:44.02]Ow!
[163:45.46]What?
[163:46.21]Oh, no.
[163:47.27]Oh, no, my confidence is gone.
[163:49.07]All my confidence.
[163:51.43]Ooh, give me that.
[164:15.79]You can't shoot yourself.
[164:19.94]How do I take this with me?
[164:24.72]He's doing it.
[164:26.38]How do I take this with me?
[164:27.90]Okay, here we go.
[164:31.48]Let's get that confidence back.
[164:45.09]Let's get that confidence back.
[164:50.34]Oh, right.
[164:50.84]Open the doors.
[164:51.30]Alright, we gotta go this way.
[165:11.42]This way.
[165:16.62]I hear somebody.
[165:21.95]Somebody's behind me.
[165:23.79]Somebody's walking behind me.
[165:29.88]What's going on?
[165:47.76]I did it!
[165:57.75]My head's wicked itchy.
[166:06.13]Hey, thanks for the weapon, buddy.
[166:21.72]Ooh, a save point.
[166:24.82]Map gimmick?
[166:36.95]Huh.
[166:38.71]Okay, that opened something.
[166:48.23]Over here?
[166:49.77]Where am I going?
[166:52.37]I think I fucked up.
[166:57.41]I think I screwed up.
[167:00.65]You're missing?
[167:01.79]Oh, sorry.
[167:03.29]I'll be back.
[167:05.45]Where are you?
[167:08.17]Okay, I'm coming back.
[167:08.81]Here I am.
[167:10.43]Uh, where did I- where am I going?
[167:11.87]The other door in the cell.
[167:14.72]Like, back here?
[167:22.11]Like this way?
[167:24.94]Oh my god.
[167:46.61]See you later.
[167:50.49]What is that?
[167:52.81]Wait, what is this?
[167:53.89]It's like an ironing board.
[167:59.35]What?
[168:00.11]It's like a fucking panini press.
[168:07.32]Is it like a parry shield?
[168:08.38]Because in Dark Souls I go like this, right?
[168:10.60]Like... Ooh.
[168:24.13]Okay.
[168:27.91]You can climb lots of things in this world.
[168:30.90]Can you?
[168:44.10]Oops.
[168:44.30]There's a chest over here.
[169:04.28]What's in it?
[169:05.76]That's a lot of money.
[169:08.24]What?
[169:08.86]Oh, my God.
[169:09.42]These are rare gems.
[169:10.48]These are rare gems.
[169:12.54]It's the same exact thing.
[169:15.52]That's the same thing I had before.
[169:16.56]Okay.
[169:25.73]Can I take the coins?
[169:28.49]Did I get them?
[169:31.63]It's got better stats, though.
[169:32.51]That's cool.
[169:32.99]This game's actually pretty fun.
[169:35.03]Can I die from this if I fall?
[169:39.67]No.
[169:43.85]It's dark down here.
[169:54.72]Oh, nice.
[169:59.81]Okay, so now what?
[170:06.22]Oh, by the way, so the next time I play VR, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna play that Blair Witch VR game.
[170:11.90]We're doing a horror game.
[170:16.65]Go back, go back.
[170:36.93]Oh my god.
[170:42.82]Come up.
[170:43.28]Okay, so I gotta go back through here?
[170:44.86]I think?
[170:53.39]Am I doing this right, or is this... wrong?
[171:03.83]Oh shit, Blair Witch is now also VR?
[171:05.87]Yeah, I guess they made a Blair Witch VR game.
[171:12.53]You need to put a green screen behind you?
[171:16.31]Tay, can you twerk?
[171:17.02]Yeah!
[171:38.82]Ooh!
[171:42.13]I need to weigh that down.
[171:48.09]What do I not care about?
[171:48.89]Alright, I'll be right back.
[172:10.21]Sheesh.
[172:11.71]Oh, sheesh.
[172:20.18]No, don't drop the fist.
[172:21.20]No, soul stone!
[172:29.03]I still kind of don't know what to... I'm going to use the wisp.
[172:33.49]You're a zoomer.
[172:35.23]I'm not.
[172:35.69]I just heard that a lot.
[172:41.35]Where's the wisp?
[172:43.83]Okay, we're following this thing.
[172:49.29]Where?
[172:50.15]Where do we go from here, man?
[172:52.97]Where do I go from here?
[173:02.53]Where do we go?
[173:02.95]Oh, the AC just turned on.
[173:09.07]It's wonderful.
[173:10.99]look up.
[173:11.37]There's nothing there.
[173:19.65]Do the map gimmick thing?
[173:21.23]Um, didn't I already do it?
[173:24.32]I thought that opened up this.
[173:30.54]Yeah, like, I pulled that.
[173:35.20]Didn't that open that?
[173:35.90]Dude, go kill a bigger monster, bro.
[173:43.27]Go back to the climbing room and open the door.
[173:44.87]Are you serious?
[173:53.84]I wanna... There we go, okay.
[174:00.95]Go back to the climbing room?
[174:03.21]Wait, you mean... He's literally shitting.
[174:08.89]I'm not, I'm not shitting.
[174:14.68]What resource pack is this?
[174:17.16]Open the door?
[174:18.00]That door?
[174:21.36]Wait, that door?
[174:22.24]I didn't even know you could open doors.
[174:47.88]Oh, boy.
[174:48.88]Look what's in there.
[174:53.16]Oh, legendary items.
[175:00.69]Healing orbs.
[175:01.31]Yeah, I know.
[175:03.63]I know all about them.
[175:10.22]Let's go.
[175:31.75]I have a criticism about VR.
[175:37.08]Every game just wants you to know that you can use your hands to climb.
[175:43.42]Look, I can climb.
[175:44.57]I'd rather just have it just do it by itself.
[175:47.21]I just hit up.
[176:12.03]Get up here!
[176:12.83]I don't need magic.
[176:24.91]I'm not a magic user.
[176:29.87]I have a bow and arrow.
[176:31.81]I'm a bow and arrow user.
[176:34.83]But I think the game really wants me to use magic.
[176:39.49]Wait.
[176:41.10]Where's my bow?
[176:41.57]Alright, let's pick these guys off.
[176:47.13]Can you climb?
[176:57.11]Oh my god.
[177:05.69]I feel like I'm playing PUBG again.
[177:08.08]There'd be a guy that had no fucking idea that I existed, and he'd be walking around picking up frying pans and looking out windows, and I would just be missing him over and over and over and over and over again.
[177:21.79]And then finally this guy down here notices that I'm shooting at him, turns up and goes, and I'm dead instantly.
[177:30.04]Like, how are people that good at video games?
[177:31.62]How are you that good?
[177:34.52]How could you hit this from here?
[177:44.77]Oh my god, you little shit!
[177:54.65]He's a skeleton!
[177:55.82]It's going through his bones!
[177:58.02]He's going... Eat this motherfucker!
[178:06.80]I hit him with that, but I don't hit him with the bow and arrow?
[178:11.64]That's impossible.
[178:14.28]That's not even possible.
[178:17.71]I'm going down.
[178:18.27]Give me that.
[178:30.58]It's not what I'm used to.
[178:31.72]It's not my specialty, but I use it.
[178:38.72]Let go of it.
[178:42.18]I don't care.
[178:45.02]Extended range.
[178:50.35]Actually, this is kinda- this is not bad.
[179:08.57]Is it gone?
[179:09.55]Oh, shit.
[179:17.71]Free Glove?
[179:18.97]Yeah.
[179:28.99]BOI FIGHT!
[179:36.33]Portals.
[179:36.67]You've just learned how to use a portal.
[179:53.07]Portal?
[179:56.27]Wait, this lightning?
[179:58.13]Why did I not use this?
[180:00.33]How many points?
[180:01.73]Should I do lightning?
[180:06.88]That was probably stupid.
[180:08.62]But I don't care.
[180:13.14]That's left, yeah.
[180:14.86]Okay.
[180:17.12]Abilities.
[180:17.64]Strength.
[180:18.14]Dexterity.
[180:20.29]General critical damage.
[180:21.25]Yeah, oh yeah, let's get that.
[180:24.23]This is kinda cool.
[180:39.95]Fuck, cool.
[180:40.71]Alright, portal.
[180:54.73]Alright, so we go in?
[180:55.41]That was kind of fun.
[181:02.79]Your ass is in the camera.
[181:06.19]Ooh, I made it out of the tutorial, this townspeople.
[181:16.52]Why is this just Tristram?
[181:24.74]Oh, this is cool.
[181:25.72]Why are you so big?
[181:34.53]How much is that bow?
[181:36.27]Ooh.
[181:41.01]Can you steal?
[181:43.09]How much is this?
[181:45.36]257 bucks?
[181:48.04]I don't want any of that armor.
[181:48.90]I don't need armor.
[181:50.26]Armor is for wusses.
[181:55.23]Two to five.
[181:56.27]What's that?
[181:56.91]Three to six.
[181:59.85]Tower shield.
[182:00.94]That's not bad.
[182:05.32]Just kill them.
[182:06.28]I can't attack a townsperson.
[182:11.44]Oh, that's my stash?
[182:12.50]This is just Diablo II.
[182:24.32]Alright, I'll go punch a guy.
[182:25.34]Potions.
[182:38.31]I can't.
[182:38.63]It's not going to happen, guys.
[182:41.63]No, I can't.
[182:48.55]Alright, so let's go.
[182:49.61]I'm ready.
[182:53.44]I talked some shit in the beginning, but this is actually kind of cool.
[182:56.95]It's a slow burn, it seems, but it seems like it's pretty damn good.
[183:08.21]I'm just gonna go and see what happens.
[183:14.81]Oh, you have quite a treasure there in that Herodric Cube.
[183:19.40]Somebody asked for that and I did it.
[183:21.24]Probably just doesn't sound very good with my nose pinched.
[183:25.71]According to the Horatrum.
[183:28.48]Hey Speed, check out the cave.
[183:38.82]What happened here?
[183:39.47]These people were killed.
[183:45.95]Something must have happened.
[184:01.22]okay so what when I was a young boy over the ocean this is where the part in the Disney movie where they get over here and they start singing out to this jump
[184:32.21]That just made me almost puke.
[184:41.58]Maybe I come here later?
[184:42.32]Alright, I'm giving this 15 more minutes and then we're going to move to another game.
[184:50.34]15 more minutes incoming.
[184:51.44]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[184:53.90]Going to the church, not the portal.
[185:01.35]Do the stat points.
[185:13.91]Send invite.
[185:14.71]Oh wait, you can play with people?
[185:17.30]Magic.
[185:17.62]Alright.
[185:17.82]I have one skill point.
[185:19.66]I could do lightning.
[185:24.64]Didn't I already buy this?
[185:29.10]What's going on here?
[185:32.13]I already did this.
[185:32.73]10% crit damage?
[185:36.63]I already did it.
[185:37.33]I did it already.
[185:41.01]Play Among Us VR.
[185:43.21]I'll probably play Among Us VR on the next VR stream.
[185:49.30]I don't even want to play that game, though.
[185:51.14]Alright, going to the church.
[185:59.82]I don't really even want to play it.
[186:03.59]Because I don't want to sit there and be like, oh, so where were you, man?
[186:06.75]Oh, I was here.
[186:07.43]I don't know anybody.
[186:08.42]I don't want to play Among Us with a bunch of random people that I don't know.
[186:15.02]Isn't half the fun trying to find out if your friends are lying to you?
[186:18.76]I don't really talk to that many streamers.
[186:22.48]There's like three people I would be like, oh, do you want to do Among Us VR?
[186:31.09]I would have to get in there and, like, just get into the lobby and say, I'm the sus guy, eject me.
[186:36.37]And even if I was a crewmate, just get rid of me, and then I'll just leave the game.
[186:39.25]I don't even have any items.
[187:17.91]I need a weapon.
[187:20.06]Don't move.
[187:21.72]What is that?! !
[187:48.05]Oh shit, here he comes.
[187:49.79]Give me that, give me that, whatever it is, give me it, give me it.
[187:51.25]Ah!
[187:52.57]Oh shit.
[187:56.36]He just ran into the wall.
[188:08.90]Why is he still alive?
[188:10.12]I fucking beat the fucking shit out of this guy.
[188:24.88]I need the weapon that's on his hand.
[188:29.65]What the fuck, dude?
[188:31.59]No, no, give me this.
[188:37.35]I'm dead.
[188:40.05]I have to buy a weapon.
[188:41.01]Alright, let's go.
[188:41.73]I uppercutted that dude in the face like at least 15 times.
[188:55.96]Alright, give me... This guy right here.
[189:05.47]It's all I need.
[189:06.03]Let's go.
[189:16.47]You died in the cathedral level 1.
[189:18.97]I died in the... Yes, I did.
[189:20.22]Because, I don't know.
[189:21.20]I didn't have any items.
[189:38.14]Okay, here we go.
[189:40.66]No more fucking around.
[189:42.40]Now I actually have items.
[189:44.20]I can actually play the game now.
[189:47.34]Jeremy, relax.
[189:48.90]Like, it's not a big deal.
[189:51.80]You heard the guy.
[189:52.68]Like, I don't even know why I did that.
[190:10.08]Alright, where's the little goblin?
[190:21.11]Some shit in VR just really does it to you, I don't know why.
[190:23.51]That was a block.
[190:25.67]I'm gonna go for a thrust.
[190:49.52]Oh, what the... Oh my god!
[190:58.61]This game is called Legendary Tales.
[191:00.09]Yeah, no, it's good.
[191:02.41]It's actually kind of fun.
[191:05.67]I did... I tutorial talked shit, but that was... I think I jumped the gun there.
[191:16.88]This kind of feels like Blade and Source where you...
[191:22.15]Where are they?
[191:22.97]What is that?
[191:32.07]What is it?
[191:41.00]It's a bat?
[191:48.52]Where?
[191:48.80]Is it behind me?
[191:58.77]It's just sound effects, there's nothing here.
[192:00.57]There's nothing here.
[192:06.84]Oh my god, there's a bat!
[192:19.34]I got a frying pan!
[192:21.10]Oh shit!
[192:34.46]The scariest enemy in the game so far.
[192:36.22]There's nothing up, what is even up here?
[192:38.59]Why would I come here?
[192:39.47]My hair!
[193:03.85]Stay back!
[193:05.99]Aye!
[193:10.49]There's nothing- What's the point of going up here?
[193:11.93]There's nothing here.
[193:12.47]At least I don't think so.
[193:32.42]I'm okay.
[193:34.18]Surprisingly.
[193:42.14]Shit!
[193:46.75]What?
[193:47.09]No, put that away.
[193:52.65]Where'd you come- What?
[193:57.84]How did I not punch him in the face?
[194:16.79]That's a bird.
[194:18.01]That's not even a bat.
[194:22.77]I'm dead.
[194:27.47]There's nothing even there.
[194:28.37]I'm winded.
[194:35.12]Give me this thing.
[194:35.66]I don't even care what it is.
[194:36.50]I have no my weapon.
[194:42.48]What?

[195:43.03]Where do I go?
[195:55.98]I can't do anything down here.
[196:11.98]Oh my gosh, this is a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
[196:33.43]There's nothing here.
[196:38.65]This way maybe?
[196:39.31]Let me touch the wisp.
[196:50.03]Where am I going?
[196:53.66]Where?
[196:59.10]Where's the wisp?
[197:50.28]He took his head off.
[197:52.04]Those are three perfect swings.
[197:57.25]Oh yeah, yeah, okay, fine, sure thing.
[198:19.53]I think I got him.
[198:23.79]I didn't lose, there's no bats in here.
[198:31.04]The deck, I don't have enough strength to do this, to use that well.
[198:48.81]Okay.
[198:56.58]No, nothing this way.
[198:58.66]Wait, boxes.
[199:03.14]Take it.
[199:09.26]I'll take it.
[199:11.75]Rest in... Sometimes I... What?
[199:15.31]What game is this?
[199:19.61]Half visible?
[199:20.55]I'm sorry.
[199:23.01]I'm just trying to stay in frame.
[199:30.67]Alright, I haven't opened this yet.
[199:38.42]I wish there was a map.
[199:39.14]Because I'm kind of walking in circles.
[199:46.89]Wait, this is new.
[200:00.50]Alright, dead.
[200:05.65]Dead.
[200:08.77]Money.
[200:14.35]I'll take it.
[200:25.60]Shit.
[200:46.12]What?
[200:58.11]Where's everybody?
[201:03.34]You look like a what?
[201:08.06]Oh my god!
[201:08.56]There's a little guy!
[201:15.67]I'm not gonna let you kill me, you little shit.
[201:17.61]No, not gonna happen.
[201:19.53]I'm not gonna let you kill me.
[201:36.55]No, pick it up!
[201:37.85]Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
[201:39.61]What is this?
[201:49.21]Oh shit!
[201:50.05]Why am I so bad at fighting these?
[201:52.19]Why has it turned into a Mr. Bean movie?
[201:55.50]I don't understand.
[201:56.38]Why does it turn into like a comedy whenever I see a bat?
[201:58.84]They freak me out.
[201:59.62]I don't know why.
[202:00.20]Okay, I can't get in there.
[202:14.39]Leave me the fuck alone.
[202:49.76]that way I could do it that would be so cool if I just like okay you know did you guys ever have the the rope climb in gym class you guys had that right
[203:22.08]That was kind of a fucked up, messed up thing to have.
[203:25.76]Did they still do that?
[203:28.76]I remember they had the ropes come down and you climbed the rope all the way to the ceiling.
[203:37.84]And it was just like, oh yeah, that's just what you do.
[203:40.08]You just climb to the top of the ceiling without any help.
[203:44.50]They still do that?
[203:45.42]Isn't that dangerous?
[203:50.49]I don't remember any safety harnesses.
[203:53.75]It's just like holding on for dear life being like, what?
[204:00.65]It's fine.
[204:02.88]That's a boomer thing.
[204:07.38]It's been 15 minutes.
[204:08.34]Oh, okay.
[204:10.22]They're like four feet tall.
[204:12.14]No, they were not.
[204:12.88]They went all the way up to the top.
[204:16.94]I remember that.
[204:17.42]Yeah.
[204:21.38]I would loathe seeing those ropes hanging from the ceiling.
[204:30.05]And you, I don't know, you'd always kind of go up, like, a quarter of the way and just pretend like you just, like, can't do it.
[204:35.67]I'm too weak.
[204:36.57]I'm way too, I'm too weak.
[204:38.53]Like, okay, fine.
[204:44.76]I really want to get up here, so please.
[204:58.02]Right here.
[205:01.83]Do I have... I... Oh, God.
[205:03.35]Do I have weapons?
[205:08.65]Alright, stop making a Dark Souls joke and play.
[205:17.90]Alright, alright, alright.
[205:19.10]It's been 15 minutes.
[205:19.82]Alright, alright, alright.
[205:21.27]I hear you.
[205:22.39]Now I hear you.
[205:39.34]I'm done.
[205:43.01]Alright, we're moving on.
[205:44.31]That game was kind of fun, though.
[205:46.21]I'm not gonna lie.
[205:46.61]Alright, we're gonna take one more BRB.
[205:50.53]I'm gonna hop in another game.
[205:51.39]I don't know what it's gonna be.
[205:52.13]It'll be a weird one.
[205:55.65]That was Legendary Tales.
[205:56.95]Actually pretty fun.
[206:00.54]That was actually fun.
[206:03.32]Final BRB.
[206:04.22]I will be right back.
[206:05.10]Gonna get some water.
[206:06.58]Wait a minute.
[210:51.32]Alright.
[210:52.66]The final game that we're going to play today, a game called VR Workshop.
[211:00.41]Making some things out of wood.
[211:03.13]Woodworking game.
[211:06.26]Kind of cool.
[211:16.18]How's the tea?
[211:16.78]It was good.
[211:17.83]Had some water.
[211:21.02]How long have I been streaming?
[211:24.26]Yeah, 3.30.
[211:24.50]Yep, this is... We're definitely getting to that point where I'm... Blowing down.
[211:33.06]This game's going to be way too hard for you.
[211:35.41]What?
[211:37.79]Choose the board that... Yeah, this is going to be easy.
[211:39.77]We're going to have a good time.
[211:44.93]Alright, let's do some woodworking.
[211:47.27]This will be where we end it today.
[211:48.39]And then the next stream...
[211:51.34]I don't know how long the Blair Witch VR game is, but I'm going to start with that.
[211:55.68]And that will probably... What's today?
[211:57.00]Because I have to have enough time to make sure the big stream on the first is good to go.
[212:04.55]So I'll probably... What's today?
[212:08.55]The 23rd?
[212:13.83]24th?
[212:14.23]23... I will probably stream next on the 27th.
[212:21.38]Because then that'll give me plenty of time to get the rest of the stuff ready for the first.
[212:26.52]So we'll probably do Cooking Sim VR.
[212:30.60]Blair Witch VR.
[212:33.91]And if I have time for one more, maybe.
[212:36.71]Maybe Among Us VR.
[212:40.83]It'd be a pretty pog day.
[212:43.74]But yeah, let's get in this and see.
[212:48.04]I'm back on.
[212:49.08]Thanks for sticking around, by the way.
[212:51.75]Kind of slowed down a little bit, the tutorial there, but I'm having a good time.
[213:04.06]Happy birthday to that person, whoever you are.
[213:07.72]Alright.
[213:12.12]So this is a woodworking game?
[213:14.82]Wait, can you guys hear?
[213:18.17]Is this sound?
[213:23.17]I don't even know if there's a sound.
[213:28.87]Is there sound?
[213:34.44]No.
[213:36.40]Uh, hold on.
[213:39.06]Okay, choose wisely.
[213:42.48]Instructions.
[213:45.92]Okay, choose the board that corresponds to the board represented in the drawing.
[213:50.68]Place the chosen board on the X. Ring the bell.
[213:54.28]Receive judgment.
[213:55.38]Contemplate your actions.
[213:56.41]Go to sleep.
[213:58.73]Sleeping pills?
[213:59.85]What do you mean sleeping pills?
[214:04.81]Why would I take sleeping pills?
[214:19.36]I didn't even make anything.
[214:20.64]I just took drugs and went to sleep.
[214:25.12]Alright, choose wisely.
[214:29.07]Begin.
[214:33.49]Begin.
[214:37.61]Okay, so I just quit the game.
[214:38.83]Flipboard.
[214:43.49]Workshop guide.
[214:44.31]Okay.
[214:49.14]Where's that, where's that chair?
[215:02.43]Alright.
[215:05.71]Workshop guide.
[215:11.06]Movement.
[215:13.32]Besides using your feet, you can teleport smoothly and rotate, okay.
[215:15.78]Press and hold the teleport button.
[215:18.42]Well, I don't know what the teleport button is.
[215:24.53]Okay.
[215:27.63]Press and hold the teleport button.
[215:29.65]Look direction, press and hold both left and right hand teleport buttons.
[215:33.69]Okay, what else you got?
[215:36.02]Tool belt.
[215:38.74]Use the tool belt to keep your tools and other items closely.
[215:42.70]Switch, interact near the belt buckle.
[215:45.60]Follow the tool belt, follows you around.
[215:49.34]I could never do anything in school.
[215:52.22]This wasn't going to ever happen.
[215:53.06]Alright, here's the wood.
[215:53.72]Okay, here's a piece of wood.
[215:58.47]Is there a dog?
[216:00.77]Otto!
[216:01.07]What are you doing over here?
[216:07.19]Daddy's working!
[216:10.30]Okay.
[216:11.98]What am I supposed to do?
[216:19.01]Oh, whoa, it works!
[216:27.19]What's that thing's name from Ed, Edd n Eddy?
[216:30.97]Okay, so I need to get my tool belt here.
[216:32.92]I need tools.
[216:39.96]That's where I sleep?
[216:41.64]Okay, what do I need to make?
[216:43.58]Choose wisely.
[216:44.50]Materials.
[216:45.94]Total score.
[216:47.90]I'm ready to submit in a second here.
[216:50.28]Choose the board that, of course, I'm going to, this is going to fall over.
[216:56.58]The board represents what?
[217:00.27]Get back in frame.
[217:00.99]I'm coming.
[217:01.59]Oh, that's a wall.
[217:03.87]I'm coming.
[217:04.31]I'm coming.
[217:04.59]I'm coming.
[217:07.33]Okay.
[217:07.67]So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[217:09.49]Alright.
[217:09.69]So here's the thing that I need to grab.
[217:12.13]This is the thing.
[217:14.94]So this goes over here.
[217:17.16]Choose the board and put it in the X. I did it.
[217:26.83]I didn't do anything.
[217:55.34]Is everyone supposed to do?
[217:58.48]Complete.
[217:59.00]Okay.
[218:03.42]Now what?
[218:07.51]Now how do I play?
[218:10.07]Welcome to the workshop.
[218:11.01]Begin a new project.
[218:13.47]What's going on?
[218:18.21]Change on the projector.
[218:22.02]Measure.
[218:22.32]Measure.
[218:29.51]Oh, it's a tutorial.
[218:30.71]Oh, okay.
[218:33.01]Oh, instructions.
[218:36.51]Saw the board to the correct length using the drawings as a reference.
[218:40.90]Submit for judgment.
[218:41.64]Okay.
[218:43.42]So I got to take that piece of wood and I've got to saw it 24 inches long.
[218:53.45]So it's got to be 24 inches long.
[218:54.75]You got it.
[219:05.49]23.
[219:05.55]Okay.
[219:05.75]There needs to be, so I have to saw it from here.
[219:14.24]So I got to saw it to that line.
[219:18.14]Cause that's like 20, that's like just about 23 inches.
[219:21.04]So now I got to saw.
[219:21.96]That would be so scary.
[219:29.41]Grabbing it by the blade.
[219:31.19]Not a great idea by the way.
[219:36.29]So, how do I do this?
[219:37.22]How does this work?
[220:01.96]Holy shit!
[220:02.78]I just did it.
[220:13.50]This is fun.
[220:15.66]Okay.
[220:15.96]So this is 24 inches long.
[220:17.95]Get it on the X. That's it, right?
[220:34.38]63%.
[220:36.92]Oh, I thought it wanted to, did I get it wrong?
[220:52.67]That doesn't make sense.
[220:59.07]I did it.
[221:03.19]Wasn't good enough?
[221:09.68]What do you mean?
[221:12.78]24 inches long!
[221:14.76]How does that make any sense?
[221:15.64]24 inches long.
[221:16.54]Oh, a vice.
[221:27.01]Okay, so what the hell?
[221:30.59]Use a pencil, mark where 24 inches is.
[221:32.13]23.
[221:32.15]That's 24 right here.
[221:32.63]That's literally 24 inches.
[222:10.81]Is this off of the table?
[222:14.03]Okay.
[222:19.40]That's 23.
[222:19.62]No, it ain't!
[222:19.96]23, 24.
[222:20.04]Yeah, I had it right.
[222:40.39]What is that?
[222:50.05]Alright.
[222:50.45]I got an 89.
[222:50.89]What's next?
[222:53.33]Make the cut.
[222:54.34]Ooh, this one's going to be fun.
[223:02.68]Please use the tape measure.
[223:05.67]Okay, what do we got?
[223:06.67]Saw the board to the correct length.
[223:09.03]Using the drawing as a reference.
[223:10.27]Submit for judgment.
[223:11.09]Sleep tight.
[223:11.73]Okay.
[223:12.05]We have to make a cube.
[223:15.02]That's easy.
[223:21.10]That's easy.
[223:38.53]What?
[223:47.13]OK.
[223:47.41]I made a cube.
[223:48.56]That's it.
[224:11.47]It's a cube.
[224:12.07]A cube is a cube.
[224:14.19]Hold on.
[224:18.77]That was a shit cube?
[224:19.67]You cut it diagonally?
[224:20.89]No, I didn't.
[224:27.78]Maybe a little, but what does it matter?
[224:31.28]Can I do it again?
[224:39.90]Oh shit, it is diagonal.
[224:41.05]Alright, I had to get a... This is the wrong way.
[224:56.93]Stop!
[225:23.83]This one's worse, I think.
[225:25.48]You need to measure.
[225:29.16]I don't like, oh, I don't like measuring.
[225:31.66]I don't care.
[225:36.95]Who needs to measure?
[225:38.01]Alright, get out of this chair.
[225:39.27]I'm going to fall down if this chair keeps getting in the way.
[225:42.15]Alright, fine.
[225:42.89]I'll measure it.
[225:43.55]I'll do the stupid thing where you go like this.
[225:48.33]Okay, look, sure.
[225:49.90]Here we go.
[225:50.36]Here's your edge.
[225:52.08]Here we go.
[225:52.96]Take a look here.
[225:54.66]Is it going to be a perfect line?
[226:03.64]Wait, how does it, this doesn't matter if I draw a line, it doesn't matter.
[226:13.22]What if I go like this?
[226:16.05]I don't get it.
[226:18.87]Read it.
[226:26.17]I can't do this.
[226:26.98]It's impossible.
[226:32.74]Measure how... I've never taken a woodworking class.
[226:41.95]Please.
[226:42.53]He doesn't know what... I don't know what to do.
[226:49.91]No shit.
[226:50.43]It's just geometry.
[226:52.67]The last time I was in a geometry class, Bill Clinton was the president, okay?
[226:59.10]I don't remember anything from that class.
[227:01.14]I don't know anything from that class.
[227:18.43]All sides are equal.
[227:21.17]Oh, I see what you mean by that.
[227:44.88]That's a perfect goddamn cube if I've ever seen one.
[227:50.10]What happened here?
[228:09.97]One of them is going to be fucking right, I'll tell you that.
[228:18.54]The teacher doesn't even check anyways.
[228:20.84]You go up there with a cube and they go, yep, that's a cube, alright.
[228:39.43]That's a passing grade!
[228:50.43]I'll take a C. Whack, whack.
[229:05.69]He's pretending.
[229:06.31]He has to be pretending.
[229:08.56]Wait nail the two boards together.

[230:53.27]Uh-oh.
[230:53.41]24 inches long.
[231:14.07]They both are 24 inches long.
[231:27.80]Okay, 24 inches long?
[231:31.28]What if I just double them up?
[231:33.37]That saves a bunch of shitload of time, right?
[231:43.25]It's 24 inches long.
[231:49.94]Tape measure.

[234:22.45]Do I have to glue this?
[234:26.32]There are grips under the table.
[234:29.17]Oh, I think this is okay.
[234:51.43]That's good.
[234:51.81]That should be at least a B. I don't even need a tape measurer.
[235:06.51]Look at that.
[235:07.45]Perfect.
[235:41.92]Did that go in?
[235:51.33]Yeah, it's in.
[236:03.38]Two more.
[236:13.34]This is solid.
[236:14.28]Maybe like one more?
[236:16.68]I think that should be good.
[236:25.66]That's solid.
[236:27.38]That's solid.
[236:28.64]That's it.
[236:30.66]That's solid.
[236:35.09]That's going to be at least a 70 or an 80.
[236:38.25]Thank you.
[236:40.67]That's definitely going to be good.
[236:44.86]That's a 98%.
[236:45.30]By the way, I need a tape measurer.
[236:47.46]You sure?
[236:53.16]You sure?
[236:55.02]Almost 100%.
[236:55.22]Alright, well now what?
[237:07.51]Stool sample?
[237:08.99]I have to make a table now.
[237:10.53]Oh boy, this is going to get weird.
[237:16.24]Okay.
[237:20.78]What is it?
[237:21.22]I have to use bread?
[237:22.04]18, everything is, it's an 18 inch long table.
[237:36.19]18 inches.
[237:36.47]So the whole thing is 18 inches.
[237:56.75]Alright, 18.
[237:59.71]What is all that?
[238:03.25]What?
[238:05.23]I only have two pieces of wood.
[238:15.24]18 inches long, and then these are 10 inches long?
[238:25.57]So I need two of these, two 18 inches.
[238:30.29]Is this whole thing double 18?
[238:31.63]Where's the measure?
[238:47.32]How long is this whole thing?
[238:56.28]Stop!
[239:01.05]This is like 27... 47... This is like 47 inches long?
[239:12.86]What's 18 plus 18?
[239:14.66]Oh!
[239:29.62]36.
[239:29.68]So I need two pieces of 18.
[239:32.68]Two pieces, two 18 pieces of this one, right?
[239:43.07]No, of that one.
[239:48.59]Um, two 18s of this right next to each other.
[239:58.18]Or two 18s of that right next to each other.
[240:06.86]This one, that one.
[240:11.82]Got the bread.
[240:15.14]Get back in frame.
[240:16.60]I, hold on.
[240:20.28]The narrow one is 18.
[240:23.20]So 18 twice, but then what about this one?
[240:26.84]Is this the back?
[240:30.97]I'm sorry, but these little dumb IKEA drawings, they're not that clear.
[240:37.75]What is this?
[240:39.79]What am I looking at here?
[240:44.77]What am I looking at?
[240:45.41]These are not instructions.
[240:47.60]These are caveman paintings.
[240:50.72]This is caveman painting instructions.
[240:53.98]I can't decipher what they want me to do.
[240:59.06]The width of the whole thing is 18, but there are two.
[241:04.12]See?
[241:06.62]One, two, cut.
[241:09.88]But this 10, what's that?
[241:13.02]The width of the whole thing?
[241:29.79]Oh, the bread's so crusty.
[241:41.70]Listen to this.
[241:43.54]When it comes out of the oven, you can just hear a crunch of the bread.
[241:51.25]Do you need a handsaw to cut through a piece of fucking bread?
[242:03.91]That would be the toughest, most disgusting bread ever.
[242:07.17]Alright.
[242:08.55]I don't get it.
[242:09.73]I don't get it.
[242:10.19]I'm not, I don't really work with my hands.
[242:13.07]I'm more of an idea guy.
[242:14.45]You know, I'm more of an ideas guy.
[242:19.04]This one needs, that one needs to be two pieces of 18.
[242:27.36]Hammer a nail into the bread.
[242:32.23]I love how you guys are giving me tasks that you know that I'm capable of doing.
[242:37.00]Like, I'm like the weirdo that just comes here and does this.
[242:41.28]Oh, yes, I hammer a nail into bread.
[242:44.46]That sounds easy.
[242:46.60]I do that right here.
[242:47.58]Hey, look what I did, daddy.
[242:58.72]No, I don't want anyone to bite into this.
[243:00.50]What if somebody bites into this and they hit the nail?
[243:03.23]Hold on, let's... As you see, we had that flavor injector.
[243:07.59]And look at that.
[243:08.69]Look at the peppercorn we put in there.
[243:13.73]Is it going to cut through the nail?
[243:18.41]One peppercorn.
[243:20.51]One peppercorn in the whole piece of bread.
[243:26.77]I needed help.
[243:29.79]Can somebody help me?
[243:33.44]Just help me.
[243:34.12]Nobody does this shit alone anyways.
[243:36.08]Are you serious?
[243:38.08]Who does this shit alone?
[243:40.78]You have three people all looking, fanning through the instructions.
[243:44.73]I don't know, dude.
[243:45.41]Do we even have those nails?
[243:47.83]Be my person that's here helping me.
[243:54.71]Make a sandwich with wood.
[244:05.03]wood sandwich.
[244:09.10]I can't.
[244:10.22]I can't.
[244:13.12]That's what I'm capable of doing.
[244:17.20]Okay, fine.
[244:18.22]Oh, there's mold on it.
[244:20.26]Okay.
[244:23.05]Okay, I'm going to slice the bread real thick.
[244:27.19]Oh, yes, absolutely delicious, thinly crusty sliced bread.
[244:31.31]No, that's too thick.
[244:38.17]Just make a- I'm gonna make a sandwich with nails.
[244:49.99]Get off of me!
[244:58.61]This is so dumb.
[245:00.27]I wanna make- Can I- Okay, what if I just make my own thing?
[245:05.24]Can I make like a chair out of this stuff?
[245:13.27]Should I just dump the whole bag of nails in here?
[245:17.53]Nail it to the calculator.
[245:21.44]Can I even do that?
[245:22.72]No, wait.
[245:23.74]Just give me a minute.
[245:25.16]I need at least two pieces of bread.
[245:27.98]What happened to the saw?
[245:33.10]Wait, there's paint?
[245:34.98]What?
[245:35.30]This game is so cool.
[245:37.09]Why can't I be smart enough to enjoy it?
[245:40.57]Ah, fresh mayo.
[245:43.62]Or ranch.
[245:45.98]Doesn't matter.
[245:48.28]Coat it.
[245:49.66]Each and every pore.
[245:58.89]It really will absorb the tuna.
[246:06.11]Okay.
[246:13.95]Where's the saw?
[246:18.01]Is there any mustard?
[246:19.45]We only have white paint right now.
[246:21.73]We only have white paint.
[246:30.02]God damn it.
[246:33.68]Dude, this whole stream has just been... Like, do the weird thing today.
[246:46.42]Can I just dump it over?
[246:47.18]Okay, where's the wood?
[247:03.35]What happened to the saw?
[247:04.27]Okay, give me a nice slice of this, a nice thick wood burger.
[247:23.34]OK.
[247:24.92]We're going to do a double, a double patty.
[247:49.89]OK.
[248:10.49]Alright, I need another piece of bread.
[248:12.97]Top it off with some nails.
[248:26.32]And let's get another piece of nice thick cut bread.
[248:45.00]Alright, what if you walked into Dad's workshop when he was doing this?
[248:51.69]What would you do?
[248:52.29]Would you be like, Dad, what the fuck are you doing?
[248:56.63]Dad's like, what's a- Okay, I can't have the nails on.
[249:04.01]It actually went through.
[249:06.29]It actually worked.
[249:07.19]Hey, hook, forget the mayo.
[249:19.86]It looks like it's lined up okay.
[249:45.17]Alright, that's done.
[249:48.17]And then somebody said, nail it to the calculator.
[249:53.13]Submit this.
[250:05.16]Alright, if it's more than 5%, I win.
[250:09.04]That's how this is gonna work.
[250:14.12]Holy shit, what?
[250:19.83]Okay, what am I supposed to actually... I'm skipping this one.
[250:29.14]I don't get it.
[250:29.56]I don't get the caveman drawings.
[250:30.82]I'm just taking pills and going... I don't get it.
[250:34.00]Oh, I have to beat it.
[250:43.35]Shit.
[250:43.69]Alright.
[250:44.59]Give me some help.
[250:48.61]Just give me, just help me.
[250:53.24]Okay.
[250:54.42]Just give me some help.
[250:55.50]Which is, tell me where to start first.
[250:59.14]Go to sandbox mode?
[251:00.56]What?
[251:07.26]Are you kidding me?
[251:09.75]Begin.
[251:11.25]Load backup.
[251:11.93]Quit.
[251:12.15]Where's sandbox mode?
[251:19.13]Nail a board to your forehead.
[251:26.36]Cycle through the entire projector.
[251:32.64]This is a million slots.
[251:44.58]Free play.
[251:48.30]Alright, what do you want me to make?
[251:49.12]What do you guys want me to make?
[252:01.28]Build a sailboat, a house?
[252:04.06]Alright, I'll build a rocking chair.
[252:10.68]Chair.
[252:12.27]I'll try a chair.
[252:19.92]Just give me one of everything.
[252:25.73]How do I get more than one?
[252:36.09]Okay, I'll make a chair.
[252:36.81]Why are they all the same size?
[252:44.40]Okay.
[252:52.21]Alright, that should be enough to make a chair.
[252:53.57]I need a few of these.
[252:54.13]Alright, let's go.
[253:01.70]I'm ready.
[253:04.90]What does a chair look like?
[253:13.20]Chair.
[253:14.04]There's a seat.
[253:15.96]We're gonna have to probably double it up or triple it up.
[253:17.58]So let's go like this.
[253:21.13]There's a seat.
[253:22.95]Obviously.
[253:23.37]Oh, look, I have a reference right here.
[253:29.55]Okay.
[253:29.71]There's a seat.
[253:30.51]Okay.
[253:47.80]I'm going to, I'm going to like double or triple this up by the way.
[253:51.00]I don't need to measure, because if you see what I'm doing here, just eyeballing it.
[253:57.66]Then we can double it up.
[253:58.35]Okay, doubled up.
[254:09.09]Do you triple it up, you think?
[254:09.97]Should it be a big seat?
[254:15.29]How big should the seat be?
[254:23.53]I don't think it should be that thick Easy
[255:05.40]Okay.
[255:12.67]Stop.
[255:19.33]I need some bigger nails.
[255:23.79]No, that's way too thick.
[255:24.81]Alright, so this is gonna be the back of the chair, like this.
[255:28.11]Okay.
[255:29.75]I need a glue or something.
[255:35.54]Options, table of contents.
[255:36.56]Okay.
[255:37.48]No, no, no.
[255:37.84]I need materials.
[255:39.98]That scared the shit out of me.
[255:41.30]That was like a jump scare.
[255:42.38]Okay.
[255:45.56]Give me this.
[255:48.48]Give me these.
[255:52.98]So first thing is first.
[255:55.26]This is the seat.
[255:56.88]So the seat's going to be two double patties.
[256:00.68]Try to get it flush if I can.
[256:03.72]It's two double patties on top of each other.
[256:07.86]Like that.
[256:11.36]Doesn't have to be perfect.
[256:12.16]Close enough.
[256:14.42]And I can shave off the edges too.
[256:15.90]I can shave off the shit that doesn't make sense.
[256:22.40]Once it's nailed, I can shave it.
[256:35.63]What?
[256:37.67]Oh, shit.
[256:41.21]It's alright.
[256:41.59]No, no, no, no.
[256:41.89]It's okay.
[256:42.15]It's okay.
[256:43.89]I need a leg.
[256:51.60]Alright, this is going to be a leg.
[256:55.10]Leg should probably be pretty... not huge, but... I need four of these.
[257:04.09]They have to be relatively the same size.
[257:07.75]I'm going to say, like, here.
[257:10.49]Because then that'll be... Okay, that's kind of weirdly huge.
[257:45.36]Okay, hold on.
[257:45.82]I need to keep this still.
[257:53.78]Just make it the same length.
[257:59.10]It's kind of huge.
[258:09.81]Just give me... Okay, come here.
[258:16.71]Fine.
[258:17.69]I'll do two at a time.
[258:24.31]Do you guys know they make wood?
[258:26.25]I just found this out literally like three days ago.
[258:30.04]So they like squish it together.
[258:32.36]They like spin it and have this long... They take a tree trunk and they essentially shave it.
[258:38.48]And they shave, shave, shave, shave, shave, shave, shave.
[258:40.67]And then they like wet it and like press it together.
[258:44.13]It's weird how they do it.
[258:48.10]Plywood, yeah.
[258:49.98]They spin the trunk and shave thinly these like puff pastry pieces of the wood.
[258:57.68]And then they like wet it and like squish it together.
[259:01.79]It's weird how they do plywood, yeah.
[259:07.43]No way, dude.
[259:07.89]Yeah, no, seriously, it's weird.
[259:11.43]You're not using plywood.
[259:12.51]Yeah, but I'm just saying, I didn't know that.
[259:15.35]But we can't learn things here together?
[259:18.02]Ban everybody.
[259:29.89]Oh, wait, that's perfect.
[259:32.29]That's actually not a bad thing.
[259:50.78]One, two, three.
[259:52.81]Okay, let's get this at least hammered in here.
[259:58.11]Hold on.
[259:58.47]I just, like, pressed a button on my keyboard.
[260:00.05]I have no idea what I just did.
[260:02.11]Fuck.
[260:14.37]Um, hold on.
[260:21.14]I have to get it in there first.
[260:31.34]Shit!
[260:31.70]I feel like this is a Chevy Chase movie.
[260:49.07]I feel like I'm not even...
[261:04.64]Okay.
[261:15.11]That's so dangerous.
[261:17.29]That's so dangerous.
[261:18.31]That's so awful.
[261:19.91]Somebody's going to get hurt.
[261:21.89]Okay.
[261:22.29]Whatever.
[261:23.07]It just has to work.
[261:25.38]So that's that.
[261:29.14]Do this.
[261:30.80]Now at least I have one leg.
[261:34.38]don't make a mistake this time okay let me put this over here get it started but don't go all the way okay no more
[262:24.12]Yes!
[262:37.95]Okay.
[262:40.15]Pretty much halfway there.
[262:42.29]How do you... Never mind.
[262:45.93]I need one... Oh, my back.
[262:47.49]Okay.
[262:53.81]I need another person to hold this.
[262:55.07]You know what I mean?
[263:01.51]Somebody else has to hold onto this.
[263:07.81]Oh no, what do I do?
[263:13.17]How do I do this?
[263:13.69]Twice.
[263:29.08]Okay.
[263:31.78]Stop, relax.
[263:45.81]Bingo.
[263:51.67]Check that out.
[263:55.23]Oh God, where am I going?
[264:08.21]Alright.
[264:10.37]Alright.
[264:12.53]Not bad.
[264:14.13]Not bad.
[264:14.69]Okay.
[264:27.12]Shit.
[264:28.34]It's okay.
[264:30.68]It's okay.
[264:31.36]It doesn't look awful.
[264:33.84]I'm almost, I've pretty much got it where I want it.
[264:38.31]but not really though.
[264:39.25]Just everybody relax.
[264:44.07]What was the pizza?
[264:44.61]This is it right here.
[264:49.29]I need a long piece for the back.
[264:53.38]This is too long.
[264:53.96]I got to cut this.
[264:56.58]I got to market with a pencil with pencil.
[264:59.60]Okay.
[265:08.51]I think my pants have fallen off.
[265:16.53]This is like, you know those services that are at like Home Depot?
[265:21.02]It's like, oh, we can get a professional in there and help you.
[265:22.98]I don't know.
[265:25.10]I feel like I'm, how do you return me?
[265:30.22]You know what I mean?
[265:30.98]Like if I was doing this, do you return me?
[265:33.15]It's like, hey man, this is like not working out.
[265:36.41]Like I'm going to return you.
[265:39.30]How does that work?
[265:47.42]That's the power of doing at the Home Depot.
[265:51.20]What if they do something like this?
[265:53.75]You just go like, hey, Home Depot, there was a little bit of a problem with the person that we had.
[266:10.07]Final leg going in.
[266:16.27]Boom.
[266:17.33]Easy.
[266:24.25]They pull a nail out.
[266:27.74]How do you pull a nail out?
[266:41.50]I'm going to leave it.
[266:42.08]I'm not going to touch it.
[266:43.52]I'm not going to touch it.
[266:47.89]Alright.
[266:49.63]So I need a back for the chair, which I'm going to say one of the, it could be like this, right?
[267:01.26]Is there a thicker one than this?
[267:02.40]That's, I mean, not thick, but wider.
[267:07.08]That's not even that bad.
[267:08.06]I'd maybe just take a little bit off the top here.
[267:13.42]You're making a Trojan horse?
[267:19.61]I need to cut... Okay, I'm going to cut a little bit off the top.
[267:21.83]It's a little too long, I think.
[267:23.38]I think it is too long.
[267:29.32]Excuse me.
[267:43.97]That kind of, okay, that works.
[267:46.09]So I need to hammer it from this side.
[267:57.16]So a nail has to go in here, be driven there.

[272:12.31]I need a little piece.
[272:14.57]Yeah.
[272:14.77]Just like one of these that sticks out a little, and then when it goes kind of up and then that way, I just need a couple of little pieces.
[272:29.57]Not very much.
[272:31.69]It'd be a headrest too.
[272:44.79]Okay, let's attach these.
[272:49.61]Make a headrest, okay.
[272:52.42]Yeah, like that.

[273:47.42]Okay.
[273:49.08]Now I got to have a piece that goes this way.
[273:53.94]That's so low.
[273:55.48]You're going to be like going like this.
[273:58.15]Put your arms on the, on the armrests.
[274:01.27]You're going to be so slumped down to even touch them.
[274:05.11]They're right next to your ass.
[274:11.28]Okay, well, it's alright.
[274:12.78]These are small pieces.
[274:14.42]Why do I think this is a good idea?
[274:15.66]They're so small.
[274:34.75]Oh, that's actually going to hurt somebody.
[274:49.75]They have to be higher.
[274:50.97]Alright.
[274:53.23]I'll fix it.
[274:53.85]I got it.
[274:54.21]I got it.
[274:54.67]Just trust me.
[274:55.21]Everybody just trust the process.
[274:56.48]Trust me.

[275:22.34]Where am I?
[275:23.48]Where are you?
[275:23.82]Okay.
[275:24.02]Alright.
[275:31.59]I think I can do this.
[275:35.92]How do I get this to attach to this?
[275:38.00]I have to go in like sideways.
[275:44.98]Is there no glue?
[275:46.09]Can't you do wood glue?
[275:58.98]Dermot, stop.
[275:59.80]Go outward.
[276:24.77]Wait, I can like bang these in.
[276:26.49]Oh, no, no, no.
[276:27.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[276:30.68]These nails are too long, but that fits.
[276:33.08]Alright.
[276:33.48]It still works.
[276:34.16]I got it.
[276:34.46]I got it.
[276:34.70]I got it.
[276:36.94]Same exact thing.
[276:50.91]Okay.
[276:52.53]And then they need to come out.
[276:53.29]Alright.
[277:04.48]Like that.
[277:05.44]That actually should be fine.
[277:07.18]Yeah.
[277:07.50]That's going to be fine.
[277:08.84]These are long enough.
[277:30.87]What?
[277:44.70]I don't know what it is about this goddamn headset, man.
[277:51.28]Okay.
[277:57.24]This is way too long.
[277:58.04]I gotta shave at least.
[277:59.36]What fell off?
[278:01.45]I have to shave this a little bit and then I'll paint it.
[278:06.57]Yeah.
[278:10.51]At least that much has to come off like right there.
[278:16.62]Okay.
[278:18.00]Okay.
[278:18.46]Let's go here to here and mark that.
[278:21.78]Okay.
[278:38.12]Looks good.
[278:38.60]Alright.
[278:49.55]So now all I have to do is the headrest and then paint it.
[278:52.49]And that should be good.
[278:56.23]Look, it's all about post-production.
[278:59.35]Those of you that think a movie is made when the actors are talking on set, nope.
[279:02.95]It's the editor, actually.
[279:05.18]The whole movie is made in editing.
[279:10.58]This is what a movie looks like before it goes to the editing bay.
[279:20.32]It's just an electric chair.
[279:22.06]Should I just make like a thing that comes out and just put it on somebody's head?
[279:24.96]This is an electric chair.
[279:35.73]Headrest.
[279:38.64]It needs to be really small, like right here.
[279:43.42]Right there.
[279:47.70]Don't need to be that cool with it.
[279:54.76]Yep, there we go.
[280:03.85]Okay.
[280:07.67]Oops.
[280:37.73]The nails going out the back.
[280:42.12]It can't stand up on its own.
[280:43.86]I need another piece down here.
[280:46.28]I need like bird feet down here.
[280:50.30]Hold on.
[281:15.12]Like that.
[281:15.76]Okay.
[281:20.82]I'm not tall enough to do this.
[281:24.46]I can just do it like that.
[281:25.38]Yep.
[281:30.46]I haven't looked at... What are people saying?
[281:31.70]I haven't even been paying attention to what anyone's been saying.
[281:36.26]You make a torture chair.
[281:37.70]I'm going to say right kind of at the end here.
[282:10.53]Alright, I need one in the back.
[282:19.87]Same piece like that.
[282:23.40]Simple.
[282:25.66]You know what?
[282:26.50]Fuck it, man.
[282:27.46]I should just do the whole board.
[282:41.46]Why are you doing it at an angle so it can spread out?
[283:01.49]Yep, right here.
[283:27.37]It's so close.
[283:28.39]It's so close to standing.
[283:33.38]I need one here, and this... I gotta have one come down a little higher.
[283:44.07]This game is fun.
[283:57.01]This is actually really cool.
[284:00.83]This is one of the cooler VR games I think I've ever played.
[284:03.37]This is cool.
[284:04.07]This is really neat.
[284:04.93]This is very neat.
[284:05.61]I like it.
[284:13.17]No, that's going to come out.
[284:21.88]I need one more here.
[284:24.28]But it's going to be... Hold on.
[284:34.96]Are you saying I can paint this?
[285:00.07]Fuck you.
[285:14.76]What is happening?
[285:21.99]Alright.
[285:28.19]It's not long enough.
[285:31.18]Oh, God damn it.
[285:32.38]Wait, it's okay.
[285:33.50]No, it's not.
[285:35.90]It needs to be longer.
[285:40.66]Oh, I got an idea.
[285:44.21]I have an idea.
[285:51.38]This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[285:52.36]No, no, no, no.
[285:53.16]Get out of the way, please.
[285:54.16]Don't break it.
[285:54.72]Okay.
[286:04.37]Stop.
[286:27.47]We're going to have to add three at a time, I think.
[286:42.37]Should do it.
[287:12.29]What's going on?
[287:36.45]Okay, this is a disaster.
[287:38.39]I'm done.
[287:39.49]I'm done with it.
[287:40.29]I'm fucking done.
[287:41.49]This is an absolute disaster.
[287:45.65]Yes!
[287:48.55]Yes!
[287:48.83]I don't even... Can I paint it?
[288:08.51]Slender man's chair.
[288:12.77]Hammer some nails through the seat.
[288:19.93]You mean like going that way?
[288:29.26]Oh my god.
[288:30.30]Okay, fine.
[288:31.98]Let's see.
[288:37.15]One like Marv nail from Home Alone.
[288:42.38]That's twisted.
[288:46.24]That's twisted, man.
[289:03.07]This kind of feels like...
[289:07.48]I feel like I got this out of a serial killer's sketchbook or something.
[289:10.82]This is weird.
[289:21.33]Give him a face?
[289:22.15]He's so heavy on the right.
[289:40.20]My god, that's gonna break something I Think I'm good.
[289:45.42]I'm good.
[289:46.88]I'm good.
[289:47.38]I just like smashed into something over here Paint it I would still sit on it.
[289:53.29]I don't I don't think I would What do I get for a rating
[290:16.94]You know, today I got a much bigger appreciation for people that are good with their hands.
[290:26.18]Hold on, let me see if I can fix this for a sec.
[290:36.61]If I take these off and I take these off, it should be okay.
[290:45.25]I don't care, I'm done.
[290:52.98]This is just the chainsaw sound you hear when you're tied up in this thing.
[291:15.20]How come I don't get a score?
[291:16.18]How come I don't get a score?
[291:19.36]Alright, let's see if I can beat the hell out of this thing with a hammer.
[291:30.95]Nope.
[291:31.17]It's pretty, it's solid.
[291:35.32]It's solid.
[291:38.64]This is not a bad piece of furniture.
[291:39.88]Alright.
[291:53.57]Alright.
[291:53.85]That's it.
[291:56.89]That was fun.
[292:01.19]How's my face look?
[292:03.37]Do I have indents all over my face?
[292:04.71]Does that even count as furniture?
[292:12.85]Probably not.
[292:22.48]Alright.
[292:23.56]I will see you guys on the 27th.
[292:26.74]Want a hair check?
[292:27.56]Sure.
[292:28.68]We're going to play some more of the major requested games.
[292:36.80]I'll play Among Us VR.
[292:38.36]I'll do it fine.
[292:55.33]Not terrible.
[292:57.01]VR face.
[293:01.46]You look like a soccer mom.
[293:08.74]Alright.
[293:09.34]I'll see you guys on the 27th.
[293:11.65]We'll do Blair Witch VR, Cooking Simulator VR, and then I'll do at least one game of Among Us in VR.
[293:23.02]I'll finally do it.
[293:24.06]I'll do the meme.
[293:31.12]And I'll see you later.
[293:33.17]Thanks for sticking around.
[293:35.75]What time is it right now?
[293:40.79]Seven.
[293:42.47]It's not too, too late.
[293:45.35]But we'll see you again soon.
[293:48.03]After the 27th, that's going to be the last stream until the first.
[293:54.19]Take care of yourselves.
[293:56.45]Oh, hold on.
[294:03.27]Wait, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[294:06.40]Among Us VR doesn't even have an announce date yet.
[294:10.12]What are you talking about?
[294:15.34]It's not out.
[294:20.20]Huh?
[294:20.78]Okay.
[294:23.70]Well, I'm still going to play Cooking Simulator, and I'm still going to play Blair Witch.
[294:34.49]It's not even out yet.
[294:35.25]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[294:42.73]Thanks for watching as always.
[294:43.65]Appreciate it.
[294:46.81]We'll see you again in a few days.
[294:50.86]Get pranked?
[294:54.54]There's a VRChat version of Among Us.
[294:58.18]Yeah, but that's not the same thing.
[295:02.20]I'll never, I forgot I was twerking earlier.
[295:04.18]That's right.
[295:04.56]I did do a twerk.
[295:08.34]Well, I did a fake twerk.
[295:09.34]I did like a comedy twerk.
[295:19.17]Oh, the games are fun today.
[295:20.05]I actually really, really liked the, um, the coin game kind of one that peer arcade.
[295:27.09]That was actually really fun.
[295:28.93]I'm surprised I was in there for more than two or three hours.
[295:35.54]The second game was really good, too.
[295:36.62]It just took a while to get going.
[295:43.05]Beginning of that Blair Witch game is slow and kind of trash.
[295:45.51]Huh.
[295:47.61]Really?
[295:50.49]Skyrim VR?
[295:51.27]I'll look into it.
[295:58.44]How long are you going to stream on the 27th?
[296:00.48]Probably not that long.
[296:03.59]Less than five hours.
[296:04.73]All these VR streams are going to be all less than three to five hours.
[296:14.06]Get a bunch of mods?
[296:15.22]Maybe I will.
[296:18.10]I'll get a good lineup on the 27th.
[296:20.58]Yeah, I'm going right into the bath right now.
[296:34.59]Why are you so into VR right now?
[296:36.81]It's not that I'm into VR right now.
[296:38.21]It's just setting VR up in a room scale takes a lot of... It's hard to kind of go back and play another game because I have it set up completely.
[296:49.06]Like my chair is not here.
[296:50.90]My computer is pulled out.
[296:53.04]Like I don't have a desk right now.
[296:55.94]So anytime I play VR, I always do it and just do a bunch of it and then put it away for six months.
[297:04.74]So, that's kind of how it works.
[297:11.66]Do I expect you to die?
[297:12.74]I expect you to die 2 came out.
[297:21.61]I played the first one on stream years ago.
[297:31.49]Ow, ow, ow.
[297:35.02]Alright, goodnight guys.
[297:35.92]I'll see you on the 27th.
[297:37.00]Take care of yourselves.
[297:37.90]Thanks for sticking around, as always.
[297:39.72]I'll see you guys soon.
[297:43.80]Goodnight.
[297:44.50]Goodbye.
[297:46.24]Take care.
