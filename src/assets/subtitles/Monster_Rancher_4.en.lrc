[00:01.06]Hello.
[00:02.24]Hi, everybody.
[00:04.28]I'm just realizing right now that this... For some reason... I don't know.
[00:11.97]Why is this not working?
[00:17.91]My Monster Rancher 4 disk is for some reason not reading now.
[00:22.74]That's weird.
[00:23.44]Hold on.
[00:28.80]Let's hope that doesn't cause a problem, otherwise we're gonna have to do something else.
[00:32.03]That's not good.
[00:32.73]It was working before.
[00:34.03]Let's see.
[00:38.17]Well, hello.
[00:40.33]Let's watch Rhythm of Heroes.
[00:41.17]Let's see what happens.
[00:45.38]What?
[00:45.94]Hope you had a good couple of days.
[00:48.30]There it is.
[00:48.80]Okay.
[00:49.52]But... Here, there.
[00:54.86]Alright.
[00:55.48]Okay.
[00:56.18]That was... weird.
[00:59.59]Monster Rancher 4 tonight, we played Monster Rancher 3, it wasn't that good.
[01:04.65]And there's apparently an animated intro to this game.
[01:14.10]Don't ask me why this is here, but okay.
[01:23.02]Didn't they make a TV show on this game?
[01:27.20]They made like a whole television franchise.
[01:29.20]Is this just a giant ad for the show?
[01:38.48]It started as a TV show.
[01:40.04]What?
[01:44.38]How come there's no audio?
[01:50.17]Oh god, you're playing the bad one.
[01:51.67]The last one was the bad one.
[01:55.47]I thought Evo was the bad one.
[01:59.96]Is there only one good one?
[02:01.36]I was told that Evo was the bad one, 3 was the bad one, 4 is apparently the bad one.
[02:13.17]Oh, that's Captain Hook Sonic!
[02:19.91]Am I gonna get flagged for this?
[02:21.64]I hope not.
[02:30.02]No, I'm not.
[02:30.60]This is just a simple introduction.
[02:35.17]This is the intro of the stream.
[02:36.41]Alright, but while you watch this, I'm gonna tweet the stream.
[02:41.07]I can't even do that with this lingering cough.
[02:50.51]I've made this noise before.
[02:51.81]I've made this song before, probably.
[02:57.95]Hey, that's Monster Rancher 4.
[03:03.58]Mm-hmm.
[03:05.58]2003.
[03:05.60]Why does it look so... somebody said, why does it look so JPGE?
[03:13.11]That's because it's old and it's being pulled through a device.
[03:17.57]But, this is what we're gonna try to do today.
[03:23.92]And I did say that if the game is terrible, I do have a solution.
[03:33.56]Okay.
[03:34.64]That's tweeted.
[03:37.28]I have a solution for if this game is very bad.
[03:42.38]Am I emulating?
[03:43.14]No, I am not.
[03:43.68]This is real hardware.
[03:44.92]I'm a real hardware streamer.
[03:53.27]New game.
[03:53.81]Versus mode.
[03:54.49]Option.
[03:54.83]Let's see what's in here.
[03:57.33]Alright, come on.
[03:58.59]Can we listen to some of the sounds?
[03:59.71]No.
[03:59.77]No.
[04:07.99]75.
[04:08.07]Don't ever have background music the same.
[04:12.09]If the game is bad, Google Feud.
[04:13.45]No, if the game is bad, we're going to Mr. Mosquito.
[04:23.70]And that was... That was hard to track down.
[04:29.04]Monster Rancher 4.
[04:31.79]Here we go.
[04:32.99]A long time ago, people and monsters lived in harmony.
[04:37.78]But eventually, humans sealed the monsters inside tablets called Saucer Stones.
[04:42.68]This is the intro to Undertale.
[04:45.05]Today, monsters help humans once again, albeit help in a different form.
[04:50.95]This is Nettle Kingdom.
[04:53.49]This country used the finest techniques available to regenerate monsters from Saucer Stones.
[04:58.36]Those are discs, if you don't know.
[05:01.16]And I got plenty of them here.
[05:02.04]Weird.
[05:02.88]That's the name of my town.
[05:03.66]And that's how it all started.
[05:04.66]And then she got snapped.
[05:35.70]Get your butt out of here, you sneaky little rat.
[05:37.78]This is TT.
[05:38.43]Don't you play innocent with me.
[05:57.44]Uh, what the fuck?
[06:00.10]I didn't come into this stuffy room because I wanted to.
[06:05.66]Huh?
[06:07.51]Boy, you really do have a lot of nerve.
[06:09.43]What the fuck is happening here?
[06:11.45]Excuse me, you two.
[06:13.69]Huh?
[06:14.03]Well, what is it?
[06:15.83]My name is Caesar, and I'm from a nearby shrine.
[06:18.57]If it's okay, I'd like to take care of that boy.
[06:24.38]Huh?
[06:24.66]You're a bigwig in this town.
[06:26.06]Well, good timing.
[06:27.05]Yeah, I bet she scares all the boys away.
[06:29.91]God to have that power.
[06:53.98]Sometimes I sit in bed and try to sleep for like four straight hours.
[06:57.38]You know what superpowers people talk about they wish they had?
[07:00.22]If you had a superpower, what would it be?
[07:02.34]I would fly!
[07:03.26]No, fuck that.
[07:05.44]I think it'd be fun to be invisible!
[07:07.24]No, that's stupid.
[07:08.94]I'd like to be able to fall asleep whenever I wanted to, and go into REM sleep.
[07:15.58]Now that's a good superpower.
[07:21.08]Oh boy, this show already asleep, huh?
[07:24.96]What's this?
[07:25.40]The boy's bag.
[07:26.30]Looks rifled through it.
[07:29.69]What an odd intro.
[07:30.97]Is this anime like this?
[07:32.47]Are these characters from the TV show?
[07:35.99]Mmm.
[07:36.75]Where am I?
[07:37.65]What?
[07:37.91]My bag!
[07:38.42]The saucer stones!
[07:40.62]Ink!
[07:42.48]Oh, sorry.
[07:43.16]Have you seen my bag?
[07:44.76]So he... I don't understand what happened in the first five minutes of this game.
[07:52.54]He broke into somebody's house, fell asleep instantly, and then an old person stole his bag.
[07:58.66]I don't know what's going on.
[08:00.08]Hmm, er, your bag.
[08:03.22]Don't be alarmed, your bag and the saucer stones are right here.
[08:06.94]Did you know this girl worried about you and stayed by your side this whole time?
[08:12.37]Maybe a thanks is in order.
[08:14.67]This girl, Ryo, she's my daughter.
[08:19.35]She did that for me?
[08:20.23]Thanks, Ryo.
[08:24.13]If I may ask, does this bag mean that you're a student at Elvis School?
[08:30.15]The elite school that trains top breeders to move their hips back and forth real fast?
[08:36.22]No, I used to be a student, but I was expelled.
[08:42.60]I hate this.
[08:43.84]This is fucking stupid.
[08:46.28]What did you get expelled for?
[08:50.12]What?
[08:50.38]What do you mean you don't have any?
[08:53.33]What?
[09:19.38]Like, does he mean ever?
[09:23.01]Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[09:30.01]Oh, yeah, he's got his parents... I don't... You have to watch this show for one anime a year.
[09:42.76]No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[09:44.58]But thank you, Kazzy, and thank you, Peekabinanna, for five community subs.
[09:47.12]Fifteen community subs right off the bat here.
[09:48.68]Thank you, guys.
[09:51.13]I can't help what happened.
[09:53.07]To be honest, I hardly care about being expelled anymore.
[09:57.05]I see.
[09:57.47]I'm sorry if I mentioned parents at all.
[10:01.86]What is going on here?
[10:02.66]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[10:04.12]Five more community subs.
[10:06.24]Damn.
[10:06.74]Thank you guys.
[10:07.22]That's 20 now.
[10:10.56]Back to back.
[10:12.43]Holy Jesus.
[10:18.33]Thank you guys.
[10:20.42]I'm sorry I mentioned parents at all.
[10:23.41]I have an idea.
[10:24.31]Why don't you work here?
[10:25.57]I'm looking for somebody to look after some vacant land.
[10:29.35]You're not doing any good just hanging around, so how about it?
[10:32.25]You could even raise some monsters.
[10:35.09]Raise monsters?
[10:36.59]You mean you'd let me run a ranch?
[10:39.15]You just met me and you'd let me do that?
[10:42.57]Well, nothing big time, but a ranch nonetheless.
[10:46.23]Now, I don't know what you did to get expelled, but I'm sure you had your reasons.
[10:50.33]This guy's messed up.
[10:53.47]What do you know what he did?
[10:56.65]You had your reasons to get expelled from school.
[11:00.96]But there's no point in giving up your dream now.
[11:03.88]So what it'll be?
[11:04.64]Let's see.
[11:05.18]What's your name?
[11:07.36]Um... Uh... Well... Uh, Fane.
[11:13.44]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[11:17.96]That is too many ways, that's too much.
[11:23.87]Fane.
[11:25.21]I don't think I want to change that, that seems pretty canon to me.
[11:29.36]Fane?
[11:31.48]P-H-A-Y-N-E.
[11:36.54]It's canon, I can't change it.
[11:48.07]Yeah.
[11:50.29]Thane.
[11:51.01]My name is Thane.
[11:51.91]This is just, like, a LiveJournal username.
[11:57.65]Thank you, Magellan, for the five community subs.
[12:04.27]Thank you, guys.
[12:06.05]Of course, I accept.
[12:07.38]Thanks, Mr. Caesar.
[12:09.46]Well, it's settled, then.
[12:10.56]You can use this saucer stone to regenerate monsters.
[12:14.64]Okay, let's head to the shrine.
[12:16.94]First monster, here we go.
[12:20.29]You can regenerate saucer stones in this shrine.
[12:22.81]Is this your first visit to a real shrine, Fane?
[12:26.73]This time we'll regenerate from this saucer stone, but if you find any others, bring them over.
[12:33.71]As long as you have room to raise more monsters, you can regenerate them anytime you like.
[12:39.73]Why does she have red eyes?
[12:43.69]This is the adult version of Annabelle.
[12:47.84]This is like Annabelle grew up to a late teenager.
[12:51.52]Wearing the same clothes.
[12:57.72]Is this the same character?
[13:09.61]Yeah.
[13:11.07]It is.
[13:15.17]It's just a little bit different color scheme.
[13:18.64]As long as you have room to raise more monsters, you can generate them.
[13:21.24]But yeah.
[13:22.64]Now feign.
[13:23.40]Let the regeneration begin.
[13:24.68]Do I get one for free, or do I have to put a disk in?
[13:29.08]So those of you that have no idea what's going on in the game, let me try to explain.
[13:35.83]This is a game where you battle monsters.
[13:38.33]And you get the monsters by putting in any disk you have in your house.
[13:42.29]And it generates a random seed for that disk.
[13:48.10]And you get a monster.
[13:51.75]So this is your first monster.
[13:53.11]Okay, let's have you give it a name.
[13:55.53]That's the first monster?
[14:00.32]I don't want this, like, default dickhead.
[14:01.92]I want my own.
[14:06.30]It's just like... That's like what a mouse design would look like if it was a Disney Pixar movie.
[14:16.37]Isn't there already, like, a Disney Pixar, like, rat mouse?
[14:22.60]It's like... I don't know.
[14:23.90]How about... Mouse?
[14:36.37]That's a wonderful name.
[14:37.51]Give it all your love.
[14:38.71]To Mouse.
[14:41.42]Now, Rio, take Fane to that empty plot of land.
[14:46.66]Eh?
[14:47.06]Oh, yes, Father.
[14:49.16]Come with me.
[14:53.54]I want that thing.
[14:55.76]Where do I get, like, the baby King Dedede from?
[15:03.35]We're here.
[15:05.33]Wow, it's huge and so mysterious.
[15:08.47]This is just awesome, huh, Ryo?
[15:11.41]Wait, I hear a voice from over there.
[15:12.79]Who could it be?
[15:15.39]Shoot, wait up, wait up, I tell ya.
[15:21.51]Finally, I got up.
[15:23.19]Are you the boy named Fane?
[15:27.33]Yes, who are you?
[15:30.03]My name is Yuri.
[15:32.27]Caesar told me to come and help you.
[15:35.85]I work at the item shop.
[15:38.45]But I always wanted to try being a ranch assistant.
[15:42.49]So I look forward to working with you, Fain.
[15:44.73]Let's do some good work together.
[15:47.45]Sure, Yuri, let's... It's time for me to go home.
[15:53.57]Hey, Ryo, she's gone.
[15:55.89]Anyway, let's do some good work.
[15:57.25]I might not look it, but I've done my homework.
[16:01.33]You can count on me.
[16:02.31]Okay, first, let's go over the ranch basics.
[16:09.68]Clean out your ears and listen up carefully.
[16:13.58]At the beginning of the week, you create a schedule.
[16:16.25]Oh no.
[16:18.39]I'm not very good with those.
[16:19.47]Schedule training to strengthen your monster.
[16:21.99]Can I have no schedule?
[16:23.11]I work way better on no schedule.
[16:27.79]And schedule breaks to let your monster rest.
[16:31.30]You can schedule up to eight weeks in advance.
[16:33.80]Use this to create a long-term plan.
[16:38.02]I'm going on like a diet, apparently.
[16:39.84]Okay, so then select the training type and time, then free time to play with your monster.
[16:47.25]By playing with your monster here, the monster's bond with you will strengthen.
[16:52.59]We're playing like Busy Dad Simulator.
[16:54.37]I got a ride in an hour to throw the ball around with my son.
[16:59.57]Praise monsters when they do a good job to further strengthen your mutual bond.
[17:04.38]And if a monster is not doing what it should,
[17:07.53]Then it's time for a discipline!
[17:11.29]Lazy monsters must be brought into line.
[17:14.15]Love is both carrot and stick and this also increases bonding.
[17:18.89]Use your best judgment and take advantage of free time as an opportunity to raise the level of bonding.
[17:24.88]Lastly, rest on weekends until you get used to things.
[17:28.14]Later you can enter competition and shop in town.
[17:31.54]Well, that's a typical week on the ranch.
[17:33.14]The rest you'll learn as you go.
[17:36.04]Well, what do you think?
[17:36.94]Did you understand?
[17:39.28]Yeah, you schedule out everything.
[17:40.62]You schedule rest, schedule training, schedule playtime.
[17:45.40]I think I get it.
[17:47.41]Kind of.
[17:47.83]Maybe.
[17:48.09]Probably not, though.
[17:49.63]Good, you're a great partner.
[17:50.49]Well, let's give it our best, then.
[17:55.95]Year 1, month 4, week 1.
[17:59.25]Schedule.
[18:01.03]Alright, so we got data, command, training, schedule, shrine, system...
[18:05.26]Maus is very lively.
[18:07.54]Let's go to schedule.
[18:09.54]So this is... This is one?
[18:11.40]This is the first week.
[18:13.10]So week, we're gonna do training.
[18:15.09]Uh, I need to see... Wait, what do you... The monster plans its own training to raise strength.
[18:22.85]No, no, no, go back.
[18:24.93]What does this guy even have as stats?
[18:29.37]How do I see his stats?
[18:30.84]Data.
[18:32.06]Monster, okay.
[18:32.60]Okay.
[18:34.92]So, power, life, high power.
[18:42.44]For one second, I don't know, my brain just didn't understand.
[18:44.68]I thought that said O-Yuromo.
[18:47.72]I was like, what is that?
[18:48.88]What name is that?
[18:49.62]I didn't give him the name O-Yuromo.
[18:53.43]Yeah, pretty dumb.
[18:54.75]But it looks like, what do you got for moves?
[18:57.67]Skills, hmm.
[19:00.73]So this is wild slash.
[19:04.13]This is a power move.
[19:05.01]This is an intelligence move for somebody with 85 intelligence.
[19:08.19]Sounds pretty terrible.
[19:10.41]And then fire charge.
[19:14.69]Okay.
[19:16.71]So I think we're going to work on power.
[19:18.89]And what is... This is also power, right?
[19:21.41]Yeah, power.
[19:24.19]I can barely read those numbers.
[19:26.85]Yeah, they are a little crusty, aren't they?
[19:31.58]Let's go to the shrine.
[19:32.45]Let's do the thing that we're supposed to be doing, first of all.
[19:36.43]I don't know if I like this guy.
[19:40.09]Well, hello, everything going well?
[19:42.39]So what will it be?
[19:44.25]Okay, let's create... You already have a monster you're... You already have a monster you're raising.
[19:50.72]So what will it be?
[19:51.46]Uh, do I have to, like, freeze him?
[19:56.40]Come again anytime.
[19:58.88]I didn't know if it was like the other games.
[20:02.95]I got lots of stuff here, don't worry.
[20:06.69]So, how do I freeze him?
[20:11.02]Shrine system?
[20:13.04]No.
[20:18.24]Holy shit, that actually is Fireman.
[20:24.56]I should have named it Fireman.
[20:30.86]It sort of is, with, like, big Groucho Marx eyebrows.
[20:33.36]Alright, so how do I, um... How do I do that?
[20:40.03]Appraise?
[20:47.65]Maybe he can, like... Just a moment, Fane.
[20:50.09]You don't have a saucer stone.
[20:52.65]There's nothing to appraise without a saucer stone.
[20:55.92]Hmm.
[20:57.74]It's too late to kill it.
[20:59.80]I'm not trying to kill it, I'm just trying to store it.
[21:08.68]Walmart brand Salamander.
[21:12.10]Walmart brand Charmander.
[21:16.64]Alright, I don't... I don't think I can fucking freeze them.
[21:24.86]Schedule.
[21:25.36]Can I, like, schedule them to be put on ice?
[21:33.50]System.
[21:34.60]Save.
[21:35.66]Versus data?
[21:38.06]Let's just save the game.
[21:42.72]Schedule him to die.
[21:51.71]Release him into the wild.
[21:53.39]He's like a baby.
[21:54.37]Alright, I think, I don't think I can do this yet.
[21:57.39]I think we just have to play with, um, I don't even know his name.
[21:59.67]Mouse.
[22:00.63]Let's block, okay, schedule.
[22:02.71]Training.
[22:04.01]We're gonna do... Power training, this is exercise.
[22:08.19]And then... Let's do a little bit of more training the next day.
[22:15.09]And then we're gonna rest.
[22:16.73]And then we're gonna do... Rest, and then... What about, like, how do I do a playdate?
[22:26.55]No, not all training.
[22:28.19]He's gonna die.
[22:33.10]Automatic.
[22:38.21]Maybe it's exercise, high jump, balance.
[22:41.89]Let's do balance.
[22:45.81]Okay.
[22:46.37]So now, let's go back.
[22:48.70]And just, let's go.
[22:50.92]Let's do it.
[22:52.50]How do I, like, play out my baseball season that I made?
[22:55.00]Do I have to do it all?
[23:00.71]Okay, submenu.
[23:07.61]I guess we have to block this all out.
[23:08.71]Alright, balance.
[23:09.87]That will rest and we'll do two weeks in a row.
[23:12.59]Of power.
[23:16.59]And then rest again.
[23:17.91]Okay.
[23:19.07]Let's go.
[23:25.50]Command.
[23:27.08]I command you to do something.
[23:29.86]Begin the training.
[23:31.96]I guess.
[23:35.34]Alright, so power.
[23:37.38]Plus six.
[23:43.85]What is he doing?
[23:44.37]He's just doing sit-ups in front of the house.
[23:52.82]Free time!
[23:56.12]I can actually walk around?
[24:05.73]Uh... Command.
[24:09.56]Um... Weekend.
[24:10.80]Book?
[24:13.50]Belongings?
[24:14.04]What do I- what do I do with them?
[24:15.42]Praise.
[24:15.96]Okay.
[24:17.38]I'm assuming the- what's the second button?
[24:31.20]I'm not gonna scold him, he didn't do anything wrong.
[24:34.77]Alright, let's see.
[24:35.23]Command.
[24:36.33]Schedule.
[24:36.69]What about data?
[24:38.11]Breeder.
[24:38.59]Belongings.
[24:39.39]Okay, so circle is how you get to, like, your inventory.
[24:42.50]Proceed to weekend activities.
[24:43.54]Not yet.
[24:43.80]Hold on.
[24:46.40]Schedule.
[24:48.20]Exercise.
[24:48.86]Exercise.
[24:51.62]No.
[24:51.94]It just plays out, no matter what you do.
[24:58.48]Cannot do any more.
[24:59.28]I cannot praise him again.
[25:00.30]Alright, well, how do I play with him?
[25:05.25]There's no play?
[25:08.99]Does he do anything else besides sit-ups?
[25:13.01]Alright, well, let's just move on.
[25:16.01]Proceed to the weekend activities.
[25:17.35]Yes.
[25:21.67]Town.
[25:22.09]Go to town next week.
[25:23.37]Do nothing and proceed directly to the next week.
[25:25.49]What do you mean?
[25:25.83]What does it mean?
[25:26.25]Go to town.
[25:29.54]Hometown.
[25:30.14]The shrine overlooks the association and other shops in port.
[25:35.44]Let's go to town together.
[25:36.74]Dude, that's like a tripled room right there.
[25:48.33]These motherfuckers, I swear to God.
[25:55.13]Alright, so let's... ...trine.
[25:58.99]Well, hello, everything going well?
[26:00.96]What'll it be?
[26:05.24]I guess... I don't think I got... I haven't unlocked anything else besides the first town in Chrono Trigger.
[26:18.53]There's nothing I can do.
[26:26.68]Well, that was fun.
[26:29.16]April, week two in spring.
[26:31.28]Hello, I heard that you're going to start a new monster ranch in this area.
[26:35.34]My name is Cynthia.
[26:36.28]I do registration for the Toggle Monster Association.
[26:38.44]Nice to meet you.
[26:40.12]The association oversees the various ranches.
[26:42.16]I'm in charge of Toggle.
[26:44.42]First, register the name of your ranch at the association.
[26:47.36]Okay.
[26:48.44]Here's how you do it.
[26:49.28]First, select a symbol for your ranch, then select a name.
[26:53.15]The name of your ranch becomes permanent, so make sure you think of a good one.
[26:59.39]Wait, it's predictive text?
[27:02.73]Farm the...
[27:05.54]Is it- wait.
[27:07.10]Farm Street?
[27:10.60]The- no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:11.96]What?
[27:14.42]The park.
[27:15.12]Farm Park.
[27:15.80]Ranch School.
[27:17.02]I don't know what this is trying to get me to do.
[27:21.34]Club Great.
[27:22.90]Club New.
[27:24.42]Team The.
[27:27.95]Street Cape.
[27:34.71]How about club cape?
[27:36.97]The club.
[27:39.87]New team.
[27:45.23]Ranch school.
[27:46.01]I kind of like ranch school.
[27:48.79]How about ranch yard?
[27:52.73]Ranchdom?
[28:00.71]Ranchdom.
[28:08.84]Dom Club.
[28:10.08]Dom Land.
[28:16.19]I don't know, these are all too good.
[28:21.15]Farm Street is also really good too.
[28:25.50]New Street.
[28:26.72]Oh, I'm gonna have to just close my eyes.
[28:34.27]Uh, Ranch Club.
[28:36.03]Ranch Town.
[28:36.79]Ranch Cape.
[28:37.61]Land School.
[28:42.90]Land School.
[28:44.46]Alright, that's... What?
[28:51.44]No, no, I want it to be Land School.
[28:55.38]It's permanent.
[28:55.88]I can't change this.
[28:59.06]There is no going back.
[29:01.20]Actually isn't.
[29:12.09]Shit, this is the worst, but it has to be this.
[29:14.65]This is cool land.
[29:26.82]Do your best, I'm rooting for you.
[29:28.91]Oh, that's fucking terrible.
[29:40.25]Such a dumbass.
[29:41.91]Look, I... School land is good for me.
[29:46.13]That would be a terrible Disney park.
[29:48.75]I can't restart.
[29:49.47]She told me, no restarts.
[29:52.45]He was expelled from school, so he made his own school land.
[29:58.62]That's fucking funny.
[30:00.36]Alright, let's go.
[30:05.36]You guys are killing me.
[30:12.91]Is that at level 10?
[30:15.35]Am I at 88% success rate?
[30:17.61]88%.
[30:18.07]9 power.
[30:18.31]That's pretty good.
[30:29.10]I don't know what these bars even mean.
[30:32.04]The top bar is not even a bar.
[30:34.30]It's a series of flags.
[30:37.70]It's a series of symbols that point to the left.
[30:40.52]I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[30:42.37]The middle one is down arrow, the bar.
[30:49.05]And then the last one, I don't know, that's somebody making a shadow on the wall with their hands.
[30:54.47]With a light in front of it, like a hand puppet.
[30:57.03]I don't know what that means.
[31:05.35]But, good job.
[31:06.55]You got almost 10 points.
[31:12.63]If only there was a word for a symbol that points in a direction.
[31:17.32]Uh, left.
[31:18.60]But why is that?
[31:19.34]What does left have to do with this?
[31:26.66]Alright, let's fight.
[31:29.84]No, not me and you, but like, let's.
[31:31.50]Let's see, let's see.
[31:32.18]How good are you doing now?
[31:33.49]200 potstock?
[31:34.13]That's actually pretty good.
[31:36.58]Okay, there it is!
[31:39.06]Alright guys, if I didn't go to this menu, you can't tell me that you would think.
[31:43.72]Focus, tired, and fullness.
[31:48.95]That's focus, not left.
[31:54.05]Alright.
[31:56.13]Let's just keep going.
[32:00.94]Proceed to the weekend activities.
[32:05.22]We can't do anything in town, so let's just go.
[32:11.57]Third week.
[32:12.11]When are we going to get a tournament?
[32:14.39]Keeping up the good work, Fane.
[32:16.69]I brought some treats today.
[32:17.97]Here, give these snacks to the monsters.
[32:21.83]Plural.
[32:22.19]I don't have more than one.
[32:24.99]On a ranch, you've got to train your monsters, but you've got to look after their health, too.
[32:29.79]Focus, fatigue, fullness, status.
[32:32.31]You can check all these stats.
[32:34.99]on the lower right gauge during scheduling.
[32:38.11]During free time, talk to your monsters plenty and care for them as appropriate to their status.
[32:43.69]And you know, breeder rank and ranch status affect the number of actions you can execute during free time.
[32:49.87]You notice the small sphere on the lower left during free time?
[32:52.63]That's the number of actions you can do.
[32:54.46]Okay, I get to know.
[32:57.04]Now, there's one sphere, so I can do one thing.
[33:02.46]Now, don't you forget to feed your monsters.
[33:04.60]Well, do your best, Fane.
[33:07.84]You received two potatoes.
[33:10.95]Thanks for the help.
[33:12.81]And two mangoes.
[33:15.65]And a squid.
[33:18.51]And a beef.
[33:25.73]And this week's HelloFresh came in.
[33:33.05]Oh, my fucking lord, man.
[33:36.79]Okay, so it's raining.
[33:38.45]What do you got?
[33:39.39]Focus.
[33:39.77]You're pretty focused.
[33:41.77]Tired.
[33:42.95]Sorry.
[33:45.79]This one was balance, right?
[33:50.42]Oh, no, this is rest.
[33:51.38]Okay, this is rest.
[33:55.90]Now can I feed you from here, probably?
[34:04.47]Okay.
[34:05.14]Food!
[34:06.80]What do you like?
[34:10.30]Squid?
[34:10.96]I wonder what kind of food you like.
[34:13.38]Mango?
[34:15.58]Squid?
[34:17.11]Most monsters eat it raw.
[34:19.55]A big hunk of beef still on the bone, it satisfies your monster's wild side.
[34:26.65]Squid.
[34:27.83]That's disgusting.
[34:36.24]Pretty nice tripled Mario jump.
[34:40.40]Yes, I'll make a Mario reference, I don't care.
[34:45.05]Now he's dead.
[34:46.97]Oh.
[34:47.35]Don't ever eat undercooked squid.
[34:51.25]Or you die.
[34:51.99]Alright, let's go to the weekend.
[34:56.60]How do I... I want another monster.
[35:01.08]When am I gonna get to... My stone...
[35:04.72]I've got all kinds of weird shit to put in here.
[35:07.47]I have a game that I didn't get to play, that I was so looking forward to, and I'm going to use it for today's, right?
[35:14.25]I bought a game that I thought was going to be hilariously fun for PC, and it just doesn't work.
[35:19.57]Yawn.
[35:21.14]Up and at him.
[35:23.48]Yeah, hmm, a visitor.
[35:24.64]Hee hee, is that right?
[35:30.74]I'm so glad you met such a fun person, mouse.
[35:35.58]Hey, Rio.
[35:37.14]Oh, there you are.
[35:38.08]What you up to?
[35:38.62]Oh, I just dropped by.
[35:45.09]Hey, she's gone.
[35:46.09]Hey, Yuri, do you think I said something wrong?
[35:52.41]Don't worry, she's always like that.
[35:54.83]She talks so kindly to monsters, but doesn't say a word to the villagers.
[35:58.14]She is a monster.
[36:01.02]Hmm, really?
[36:06.95]Okay, what's the schedule look like this week?
[36:10.59]Balance, rest, exercise, exercise, rest, exercise, exercise, rest.
[36:15.73]Yeah.
[36:17.47]That sounds pretty good.
[36:18.12]No, actually, no, fuck that.
[36:29.76]I like that better.
[36:31.90]Actually, hold on a minute here.
[36:33.34]Hold on a minute.
[36:34.44]I'm thinking.
[36:37.30]Yeah, I think I'd rather put it on my streaming schedule.
[36:40.19]You know what I mean?
[36:46.23]Yeah, okay.
[36:55.35]That looks good.
[36:58.89]Three days on, two days off.
[37:00.71]Two days on, one day off.
[37:02.85]Hmm.
[37:07.37]Go for it.
[37:08.49]Let's get some more life.
[37:15.98]Plus 7 life, good.
[37:18.84]Success rate of 90%.
[37:20.34]I wonder... You know, I kind of miss, I really do miss from the second game, when you get to see like the fun little cartoon of them doing it or failing it or not, you know what I mean?
[37:30.17]This is dumb.
[37:33.68]Where's like the cool, where's like the them actually doing the technique and try, you know what I mean?
[37:39.26]You're just balancing on one foot and I see a meter go up.
[37:44.99]Uh, how you doing?
[37:46.23]Lively.
[37:53.29]The first, Monster Rancher 2 really is the best game.
[37:56.35]It's like really the only one you should play.
[37:58.31]But, hold on, I'm gonna hold off until we get some more monsters here.
[38:05.69]Alright, he's not hungry, he's fine.
[38:13.12]Just play two?
[38:14.00]Well, I need to see what this has to offer.
[38:16.80]I'm not gonna write it off yet.
[38:19.12]The moon is so bright tonight, I can't sleep.
[38:21.86]God, I wish I had that superpower.
[38:23.61]That Jerma I-85 talked about at the beginning of the stream.
[38:27.49]When I was expelled from school, I thought I lost my shot at my dreams.
[38:32.03]But now here I am, standing in the middle of this ranch.
[38:35.53]Under such a beautiful moon, what a strange fate.
[38:39.09]Hmm, is somebody there?
[38:44.12]We don't get many chances to meet these days, do we?
[38:48.30]Well, you know, you're welcome to come anytime you like.
[38:54.12]He sure seems like a nice boy.
[38:56.06]I sure wish I could meet him too.
[39:00.85]No!
[39:02.39]If you did that, you'd be in trouble.
[39:05.33]Just like I am now.
[39:07.96]I'm sorry, please don't cry, Ryo.
[39:11.32]Is this a tree?
[39:12.44]Don't worry, I won't do anything rash, okay, Ryo?
[39:17.82]Ryo?
[39:19.26]No, I'm sorry.
[39:19.94]Well, I've got to go.
[39:21.75]Ryo, who is she talking to?
[39:23.83]I couldn't get a good look.
[39:26.17]There's the tree.
[39:42.78]It was sweet rind.
[39:45.88]May, week one, May.
[39:47.98]We have a visitor.
[39:48.76]Okay, let's get this out.
[39:50.28]Let's get the game going.
[39:53.38]Well, hello, Yuri and Fane.
[39:56.85]This place is turning into a very nice ranch.
[40:00.63]You bet it is.
[40:01.57]I wouldn't settle for anything less.
[40:04.13]So what brings you here?
[40:06.57]Well, I figured it's about time for you to start thinking about the competition.
[40:11.36]Would you like to go and take a look first?
[40:14.89]Wow.
[40:15.17]Yeah, of course.
[40:15.75]I'd love to go.
[40:17.59]You too, right?
[40:19.23]Fain.
[40:19.53]I'm not doing that every time.
[40:21.17]Yeah, sure.
[40:21.53]I'll bring Miles along.
[40:23.69]Are we going to get a heart tear at the heartstrings here?
[40:28.07]Are we going to lose this monster?
[40:30.15]And then it's... This sure is exciting.
[40:33.42]Next is the main event with the Ruin and Breeders.
[40:37.02]Hmm.
[40:42.50]The rabbit class.
[40:46.16]Ladies and gentlemen, finally presenting the beautiful thorned rose of Thimba, Miss Titi and her Kellerino.
[40:55.30]Why is she here?
[40:56.25]Huh, if it isn't that kiddo, what the heck are you doing here?
[41:02.91]What, you even brought a monster?
[41:04.53]Wait a minute, don't tell me you're a breeder.
[41:07.95]Well, well, is that so?
[41:11.35]Hmm.
[41:13.07]Well, I can see you've got the perfect monster for playing in a sandbox.
[41:18.17]The whole crowd fucking laughs.
[41:20.47]Did you say?
[41:20.97]See, I just did that.
[41:24.25]I just fucking did that laugh.
[41:26.93]I think syllable for syllable.
[41:32.79]I told you guys think I'm fucking stupid.
[41:34.85]I know these things.
[41:36.93]At least you'll get to see my wonderful fighting style.
[41:39.03]Hmm.
[41:40.31]Well, I could give you my signature.
[41:42.09]At least that would make your trip here worthwhile.
[41:44.23]And then I laughed.
[41:48.25]And then we fight and we instantly beat this person.
[41:53.05]Because this person actually sucks at what they do.
[42:00.84]What?
[42:01.36]Oh, we're not playing.
[42:04.24]Apparently we're not playing.
[42:08.86]My internet's dying, though.
[42:12.94]Are we good?
[42:14.68]Come on, man.
[42:16.03]Come on.
[42:19.29]I'm dropping a lot of frames.
[42:21.33]Are you guys seeing the frames?
[42:23.69]It looks like I'm dropping a shitload of frames.
[42:27.87]I think we're okay.
[42:33.79]RIP INT for internet, probably.
[42:42.51]Well, we'll just let it see if it passes.
[42:44.29]Usually it does.
[42:47.63]Hope so.
[42:48.64]Oh, what is wrong with that girl?
[42:49.76]I'm getting really impatient with her.
[42:51.24]I'm getting impatient with Cox, too.
[42:55.54]Huh?
[42:55.84]It's Rio.
[42:56.36]Is that like an emoji?
[43:02.03]That looks like somebody doing an elaborate emoji in chat.
[43:08.71]That has to be something.
[43:11.93]I don't know what that would mean, but it might mean something.
[43:17.13]Welcome home.
[43:18.81]Hmm?
[43:20.65]What is it?
[43:22.69]I see.
[43:24.37]When you were in town, some girl said something awful about you.
[43:29.06]I'm so sorry.
[43:29.70]Yeah, I see.
[43:30.28]But you can't let a mean girl like that get the best of you, okay?
[43:34.82]Bye.
[43:38.33]She's gone.
[43:40.16]Did I ever tell Ryo about that girl?
[43:42.06]Nah.
[43:44.98]It was as if Ryo was talking to Maus.
[43:48.86]Now you can go to the Monster Association and level up.
[43:55.10]Association.
[43:56.88]Go to the Monster Association.
[43:58.16]Yes.
[43:59.43]Finally.
[44:00.97]Got a 45-minute tutorial here.
[44:06.69]Oh, hello, Thane.
[44:08.99]What can I do for you today?
[44:11.67]Here we are.
[44:13.29]Alright.
[44:14.45]So.
[44:15.47]Combine, retire, ranch.
[44:18.47]Do I really want to retire Maus?
[44:23.31]Do I?
[44:28.35]Thank you very much.
[44:29.35]No, shit.
[44:31.79]Couldn't you freeze them?
[44:32.85]You can't freeze them in this game?
[44:47.77]Once you retire, you cannot unfreeze.
[44:49.95]You can only combine.
[44:52.72]Oh, shit.
[44:55.90]Oh, that's not good.
[45:02.56]But we need to put, like, Seaman in here.
[45:05.41]No.
[45:06.03]See you later.
[45:12.23]I need to see what comes out of Seaman.
[45:13.65]It's important.
[45:19.63]But don't worry, we can combine, uh... Retire Maus.
[45:28.02]This is gonna end up being a mistake, but... 200 power, we'll get something better.
[45:34.94]You had a good run of doing 30 fucking push-ups.
[45:40.62]And like, balancing on your foot for five minutes.
[45:52.52]Bye.
[45:52.86]This is like fucking kind of... That was so sad.
[46:04.83]That was really sad.
[46:07.02]What'll it be?
[46:08.46]Which method will you use to create a monster?
[46:11.52]From the saucer.
[46:13.98]Alright, you ready?
[46:17.52]Well, let's turn the camera on.
[46:21.14]I did like a disappearing act right there.
[46:23.06]Alright, first thing going in.
[46:26.38]By the way, hi.
[46:34.83]First thing going in, as you know, is gonna be Seaman.
[46:41.58]Seaman is the first game going in.
[46:42.72]See you in a minute.
[46:52.13]Your hair looks great.
[46:55.74]Jimmy Newton mustache.
[46:57.42]Single left side mustache hair.
[46:59.28]Alright, open the disk tray.
[47:03.76]Opening disk tray, okay.
[47:04.86]What are you talking about?
[47:08.73]Insert a CD or DVD into the disk tray and push the X button.
[47:12.97]Here we go.
[47:16.55]We are going to see what we get from Seaman.
[47:18.86]And we'll try a few of these.
[47:23.48]And then press X. Checking disk.
[47:29.00]I'm going to laugh.
[47:35.41]If it's a fish with a face, then we have to play with it.
[47:41.39]Any CD will work, no matter what it is, as long as it has data on the disk.
[47:48.64]Alright, here we go.
[47:50.81]Opening disk tray, if okay, press the X button.
[47:53.09]I don't know what they keep saying that for.
[47:59.41]Alright.
[48:01.01]Hold your breath.
[48:08.21]What classic monster are we going to get out of here?
[48:10.61]Remember when you recorded yourself screaming and it caused a blackout?
[48:19.84]I do.
[48:23.13]Okay, thanks for waiting!
[48:24.41]Time to create a monster!
[48:29.31]Pull the lever!
[48:33.42]The planets have to align.
[48:45.77]What the hell is that?
[48:50.03]An odd monster, I'd say.
[48:52.90]I see, it's the first time Thane has raised this monster.
[48:55.83]Let me add a page to your book.
[48:58.65]Take this monster home with you.
[49:00.93]Um, yes.
[49:06.01]So you're naming this monster.
[49:08.99]Uh, it's like a... It's like a hippopotamus rhinoceros triceratops on a wheel.
[49:18.29]Yeah.
[49:18.39]Yeah.
[49:22.74]It was fate.
[49:23.48]It has to be Vroomer.
[49:27.74]Is Vroomer okay?
[49:39.23]Can you appraise my monster?
[49:42.07]Oh.
[49:45.21]Let's go back to the ranch and take a look at the stats.
[49:54.11]Does what CD you put in matter?
[49:57.13]Um, I think you'll get the same thing from the same disk.
[50:01.23]It's just a seed that is created from whatever is on the disk.
[50:06.92]So, it's just, it could be, it is random, but whatever the seed that comes from the data on the disk, I believe is the same seed.
[50:15.12]Maybe.
[50:15.90]This could be wrong.
[50:16.96]Alright, let's go.
[50:18.58]Uh, let's take a look.
[50:23.66]Oh, you are terrible.
[50:24.96]Look at how bad this monster is.
[50:29.68]133 is the highest stat.
[50:32.74]What do you have for moves?
[50:37.15]You've got backspin and drifting.
[50:42.91]Drifting.
[50:45.61]Drifting does a decent damage, but with a high crit.
[50:51.16]It takes 23 guts to use.
[50:53.96]It has no effect.
[50:55.62]This has no effect either.
[50:59.32]Well, so it's obviously a power-based monster.
[51:06.65]God damn it, this thing sucks.
[51:10.85]Looks like power and accuracy.
[51:15.96]I don't know what you're going to have to do.
[51:18.23]Alright, let's do some training here.
[51:19.35]Let's see if we can get this any better.
[51:24.45]Schedule.
[51:24.83]We got no rest.
[51:26.89]Power.
[51:28.31]The next week.
[51:29.45]Power again.
[51:31.45]You can rest and then two.
[51:32.83]Let's go with shadow boxing.
[51:37.45]Shadow boxing.
[51:39.61]Rest.
[51:41.99]Power.
[51:43.31]Rest.
[51:44.35]No.
[51:45.83]Alright, let's go for it.
[51:48.63]Let's see if I can get anything better.
[51:49.69]It just picks up its wheel.
[51:56.63]That's all it does.
[52:02.60]It just lifts up its wheel over and over again.
[52:07.80]I didn't see it.
[52:08.98]Okay, that's because my notifications don't go through audio-wise because I'm plugged into the PlayStation 2.
[52:16.27]But Comedy Chatman gave 50 bucks.
[52:19.71]Thank you so much, Comedy Chatman.
[52:21.05]5,000 bits.
[52:25.94]I will not financially support a man who plays Monster Hunter.
[52:28.58]It's not about the money this time.
[52:30.22]It's about the message.
[52:32.00]Well, this is Monster Rancher, so I'm not playing Monster Hunter.
[52:35.24]So that's fine.
[52:36.62]He's doing CrossFit.
[52:41.35]This is such a weird, uncanny, strange person here.
[52:47.37]But thank you so much, Comedy Chatman, for the 50 fucking dollars.
[52:52.93]How much did that raise it by?
[52:54.47]Not by very much, but...
[52:56.74]I feel like we can take this thing somewhere.
[53:13.48]Somebody said, is the wheel part of his flesh?
[53:15.42]It has to be.
[53:15.96]Thank you, WatchingWho.
[53:25.71]So much better than Mao's?
[53:26.77]Well, statistically, no.
[53:29.21]But, aesthetically, yes.
[53:34.06]Yeah, this weird wheel is part of his body.
[53:38.68]It's somehow detached.
[53:41.04]Creepily enough.
[53:41.86]Alright, let's go.
[53:44.05]You don't need to eat right now.
[53:53.87]The moonlight is bright tonight, just like the other night.
[53:59.48]Where is Vroomer heading off to?
[54:00.86]Okay, for a second I thought that was the car noise going by.
[54:07.78]I was about to be like, you gotta be kidding me.
[54:11.26]Well, Rio, I can see the monsters love you, like they always do.
[54:16.38]I have an idea.
[54:17.02]Why don't you run the ranch along with that boy, Fane?
[54:20.89]I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.
[54:22.37]Don't you agree, Vroomer?
[54:23.57]I can't.
[54:26.89]It'll just turn out the same as always.
[54:28.33]They'll become scared of me and eventually hate me.
[54:34.28]I don't want to be hated again.
[54:37.34]You mustn't assume things real.
[54:39.46]You've got to open your eyes, be brave and say what you want to say.
[54:46.28]When you have too many sequels, you just start to make, like, a dumb, fucked up story.
[54:49.52]When it's just about, like, raising monsters and, like, battling them Pokémon-style, why are we doing, like, talking to, like, a magic tree in this game?
[54:57.90]Ayee!
[54:59.79]What?
[55:02.15]What, Fane?
[55:02.77]No, don't look at me!
[55:05.07]No, it's alright, Ryo.
[55:06.55]You can't hide it forever.
[55:08.33]I told you she was a monster.
[55:10.05]It's a beautiful moon tonight, anyway.
[55:12.68]Why not talk it all out?
[55:17.02]My name is Mokruji.
[55:21.52]Trees with unusual powers, like myself, are called spirit trees.
[55:26.46]Who's talking?
[55:27.18]Oh, he is.
[55:27.70]I'm one of the- I was gonna say, you're not a tree.
[55:31.30]Like, pretending to be a tree.
[55:34.24]I'm one of the oldest spirit trees.
[55:37.98]And at some point in my life, I learned to speak human a bit.
[55:43.68]At some point, I learned how to speak human.
[55:48.80]Every language.
[55:53.58]I didn't want to surprise them, so during the day I stay quiet.
[55:58.41]Wow, but you know, isn't it kind of sad to stay quiet even though you can speak?
[56:09.13]You humans have nothing but fear of any kind of power!
[56:12.15]You don't understand, you attack it!
[56:14.94]Ryo, what are you doing?
[56:17.50]I'm sorry about her.
[56:18.56]Ryo, you see, is a very unusual girl.
[56:20.70]She's part tree.
[56:22.66]She has the power to talk to monsters.
[56:26.56]And from a young age, that power was feared by others, and she was disliked for it.
[56:33.05]I didn't know that.
[56:33.57]I'm sorry, Ryo, but... You shouldn't keep your thoughts to yourself.
[56:39.43]If you do, you'll never be able to share your feelings.
[56:42.96]Rio, you just have more chances to understand others than ordinary people do.
[56:46.22]This is what happens when writers and developers get bored.
[56:49.38]It just is.
[56:50.38]This is Monster Rancher 4.
[56:51.22]You know what I mean?
[56:55.89]At some point, you just like... You don't want to make Monster Rancher 2 again.
[57:01.85]So now you're making... It's like you got bored and you're gonna make something else.
[57:11.96]Yeah, chances.
[57:13.60]To be able to speak and understand monster language, that's an amazing opportunity.
[57:20.53]I've never thought about it that way.
[57:24.39]I was always just so scared, I couldn't look at it that way.
[57:26.65]Does this happen in the anime?
[57:28.37]Or is the anime like a different universe?
[57:32.88]If you close your heart, you'll never be able to rid yourself of your fears.
[57:37.50]You might be right, Sora.
[57:41.20]Oh, it's about time for me to go home.
[57:44.35]Good night, Fane.
[57:48.43]Yeah, good night, Rio.
[57:54.37]Okay.
[57:55.59]Do nothing and proceed to the next week.
[57:57.17]Let's go.
[58:03.69]May, week two.
[58:04.79]Spring.
[58:06.81]In the day ahead of us, rumor...
[58:09.49]Wait, Fane, first, take this.
[58:11.51]What is it?
[58:12.97]It's my extra special battle practice, Kitty Meowser.
[58:18.61]First, use this to review monster battles, okay?
[58:22.47]What's with you today, Yuri?
[58:23.53]Pretty early to be bouncing off the walls.
[58:27.49]You want to know why?
[58:28.09]Because I'm determined to beat that nasty girl in the competition.
[58:32.17]I'll kick her butt to Kingdom Come.
[58:33.79]I'll send her to a one-way trip to La La Land.
[58:37.81]Vroomer.
[58:38.81]Imagine this is her and let her have it.
[58:42.23]We're gonna get beat by the training dummy.
[58:53.12]Vroomer versus Meowser.
[58:54.54]Alright, do I get to see their stats?
[58:58.94]They usually have a screen.
[59:00.40]I guess that is their stats.
[59:04.97]Ready.
[59:05.97]Fight.
[59:07.39]Alright, here we go.
[59:08.17]You ready, Fain?
[59:08.79]Here I go.
[59:10.41]First, approach the opponent.
[59:11.71]Get into short range.
[59:14.80]Uh... Hey, don't back up.
[59:16.18]Get close.
[59:16.74]I'm trying.
[59:17.18]You're moving the camera around.
[59:18.20]There you go.
[59:21.78]That's within short range.
[59:24.52]Next is step back.
[59:26.14]Press the D-pad or left stick away from the opponent, then push the triangle button.
[59:31.88]Yep, that's just like the second one.
[59:34.52]Yes, perfect.
[59:37.14]This is called a step-back, don't forget.
[59:39.83]Next is a step-in.
[59:41.57]Push the D-pad or left stick toward the opponent, then push triangle.
[59:46.39]Yep, it's like a little dash to get close.
[59:48.81]Exactamundo.
[59:49.86]All 10s.
[59:50.44]This is called a step-in.
[59:52.48]Next is a slam.
[59:53.48]Get close to your opponent and push.
[59:55.14]Yeah, you can break it up, right?
[59:59.36]Nice throw.
[60:01.13]Next, use panel rotation to select a move.
[60:03.57]R1 and R2 buttons swivel it around.
[60:05.89]R1, okay.
[60:09.45]You get multiple panels.
[60:16.03]Panel rotation.
[60:20.34]Try your skills, give them hell, move to the distance, set in the skill panel.
[60:23.28]Yep.
[60:23.82]And push the O, X, or you can push any button.
[60:28.16]Okay, so...
[60:30.89]Drift.
[60:32.67]Guts down.
[60:35.79]Very good.
[60:36.17]Now you're ready to compete in the tournaments.
[60:40.33]Yeah, it's just like the second game.
[60:42.88]The combat is very much the second game.
[60:48.34]I don't know how it was in the third game.
[60:49.38]I don't think we even saw combat in the third game.
[60:51.08]I didn't like the third game at all.
[60:55.87]Okay, so... Use the skills screen under monster data to assign monster skills to the panel.
[61:01.56]Right.
[61:06.48]After you learn a new skill, don't forget to assign it to a panel.
[61:09.46]You can't use the skill without it being assigned.
[61:13.38]Also, if you learn knowledge of fire, etc., you can assign elements to certain skills.
[61:18.64]Oh, that's a whole nother layer.
[61:21.02]Try to figure out the weak points of your enemies.
[61:22.80]You got it?
[61:23.94]Yes.
[61:25.37]Practice makes perfect.
[61:26.15]Do your best.
[61:30.53]Alright.
[61:32.17]So.
[61:34.16]Let's go to schedule here.
[61:35.20]Yeah.
[61:39.16]I'm going to do power here.
[61:42.42]Go for it.
[61:45.41]No, no, no, no.
[61:46.03]No, this.
[61:49.86]Are these games actually any good?
[61:51.64]They are.
[61:53.06]There we go.
[61:54.02]Plus nine.
[61:55.14]Level eight power.
[61:56.60]New move, maybe?
[62:02.65]How you doing?
[62:03.75]Eh, you're a little... You're not that tired.
[62:05.29]You're fine.
[62:07.83]Good work.
[62:10.65]He looks like a beanie baby.
[62:12.75]He does look like a beanie baby.
[62:15.89]Ha ha ha!
[62:18.95]Nice job, rumor.
[62:24.66]Let's keep going to the weekend.
[62:34.26]Which one is my favorite?
[62:35.24]Monster Rancher 2 is probably the best.
[62:38.80]So far, at least.
[62:40.60]Let's try entering a competition.
[62:42.22]Sounds like a good idea.
[62:44.32]But I don't really know how.
[62:45.34]Maybe we should go talk to Cynthia about it.
[62:48.92]Hehe, I thought you'd say that.
[62:50.22]So I brought a competition calendar.
[62:52.44]Use this to enter the competition.
[62:54.66]First, use the cursor to mark the competition that you want to enter on the calendar.
[62:58.23]Right, you just go... I get it.
[63:00.75]Then select the monster and add it to the schedule.
[63:05.75]Next, find a weekend that a competition is being held and select it as your weekend activity.
[63:12.16]Also, to enter official competitions, you have to first earn star points from normal competitions.
[63:17.73]If you win an official competition, your monster's rank rises, and you can enter higher-ranked competition.
[63:24.42]But to enter the top-ranked official competition, your breeder rank has to rise, too.
[63:28.88]Only the association can... It's hard to know when your rank will... Yeah.
[63:34.28]So I guess you just have to hope for the best.
[63:37.22]I guess that's about it.
[63:38.09]Well, did you get all that?
[63:39.75]Yeah.
[63:40.93]You're all set.
[63:43.99]Let's beat that annoying TT girl.
[63:45.81]Welcome to Monster Rancher 4.
[63:52.27]calendar so we have uh 800 bucks and we get a potato what a shitty competition so we're currently e-ranked you climb all the way up to s I think the highest we've ever been Monster Rancher 2 was like a or b right that's the farthest we got before I stopped playing alright so this is the single raspberry cup this is today right
[64:30.11]Potato, tournament, tournament, prize, it's all the same thing.
[64:36.05]So this is May, this is week four.
[64:38.73]Let's, um, let's wait, let's get this one.
[64:41.10]June, week, week two, June, June week two.
[64:45.90]Let's enter this one.
[64:51.78]All set, right?
[64:55.51]Yeah, rumors in there, right?
[65:01.99]So now let's look at the schedule.
[65:04.64]So June, here it is.
[65:07.06]Let's actually rest up.
[65:09.78]See if we can do anything here.
[65:14.44]Let's train today.
[65:18.98]And then train tomorrow here.
[65:23.32]And then rest the day before.
[65:33.74]So we got shadow box, exercise, rest, and then rest the day of the tournament too.
[65:40.66]Sounds pretty sick to me.
[65:43.34]Here we go.
[65:47.76]Any points?
[65:48.34]Plus seven points in accuracy.
[65:49.89]Okay.
[66:04.40]Should we, like, play or something?
[66:05.56]Alright, let's, uh, let's give you some food.
[66:09.44]What do you eat for food?
[66:11.41]Is this a carnivore?
[66:12.15]I don't think so.
[66:14.15]Mango?
[66:17.15]Here, try one of these.
[66:22.73]I think he liked it.
[66:23.63]I think that means I like it.
[66:29.21]He's doing okay.
[66:34.08]Just go to the weekend.
[66:38.14]Competition.
[66:38.76]Enter monster being raised in competition.
[66:40.50]No.
[66:45.26]Not ready yet.
[66:50.99]So this is week four.
[66:59.35]Lift.
[66:59.65]Nice.
[67:01.87]Nice.
[67:05.19]Still have a really high success rate.
[67:07.85]During free time, you can feed and... ...praise, scold.
[67:11.64]You can give items, too.
[67:14.76]Praise.
[67:18.59]It's bouncing with agony.
[67:19.99]You need to euthanize this thing.
[67:21.71]What?
[67:22.99]No.
[67:23.41]What are you talking about?
[67:25.87]It's having, like, a bunch of fun.
[67:30.96]Alright, here we go.
[67:31.54]Weekend.
[67:33.12]How's this?
[67:33.48]Let's take a look at the stats now.
[67:34.92]Not that bad.
[67:36.78]156.
[67:37.08]134.
[67:37.26]It'll be probably around like 160.
[67:46.75]What's it carrying?
[67:47.35]It's carrying its own body, which is a wheel.
[67:54.25]Somehow.
[67:54.62]Alright, this is the last week before the tournament.
[67:59.61]This is a day of rest.
[68:08.13]Be gentle to this kind creature.
[68:09.70]I am.
[68:11.94]I don't think there's anything else I can do, so might as well just begin the training.
[68:19.27]Isn't the training just rest?
[68:20.85]It is, right?
[68:37.14]Alright, it's kind of... is this like... this looks like roadkill.
[68:48.45]Is that like part of the thing here?
[68:51.47]Steal the wheel.
[68:54.39]Roll the wheel off the cliff.
[68:59.52]I'm not gonna do that.
[69:01.64]Have another mango.
[69:06.69]You killed him.
[69:10.57]Alright.
[69:11.37]Very lively.
[69:12.43]Not tired.
[69:13.75]Focused.

[70:34.85]That's like a weird... That's a weird microphone.
[70:38.69]Alright, so we've got Vroomer, Cipher, Charon, and Ober.
[70:46.85]Let's take a look at the info.
[70:48.73]Enemy.
[70:50.17]So Cipher is a chump.
[70:53.77]Uh, low... I got higher power, low into... yeah.
[70:59.22]Life is not that bad.
[71:04.89]I think this will be easy.
[71:07.29]Give commands.
[71:08.35]Let's go.
[71:11.83]35 speed.
[71:16.04]Alright, Vroomer.
[71:16.64]Let's fucking run him over.
[71:19.50]Vroomer versus Cipher.
[71:23.20]Cipher looks like it is in complete and total agony.
[71:29.30]That thing is fucked up.
[71:31.74]It's got five, one, two, three, four, five faces probably?
[71:35.76]Are the faces on the feet?
[71:40.24]Here we go.
[71:45.71]Trying to back it up.
[71:47.11]Got's 59.
[71:47.39]It's actually, it's getting closer.
[71:52.41]Bullish.
[71:56.17]Backspin.
[71:58.49]Nice!
[71:59.61]Oh, that's a good move.
[72:05.55]It just almost killed me.
[72:06.97]I'm almost dead.
[72:08.69]Okay.
[72:12.09]I gotta get in closer, I think.
[72:14.23]Yeah, stay in close.
[72:17.53]Got him.
[72:23.66]Look at me!
[72:26.59]That was almost pretty bad.
[72:28.35]Okay, who's next?
[72:35.11]This is Charon and Auber.
[72:38.63]I think it just tells you who wins.
[72:39.77]Alright.
[72:42.67]Looks like Auber has the upper hand here.
[72:45.51]Auber wins.
[72:46.91]So it's Vroomer versus Auber in the championship for this.
[72:49.45]Let's take a look at the other one.
[72:53.30]Hmm.
[72:56.71]I need more defense.
[72:57.53]I almost got one shot.
[72:58.37]Alright, so this is a chump.
[73:01.25]What kind of a... I think I'm ready.
[73:09.74]Rumor versus Uber.
[73:19.74]That's not a bad looking monster though.
[73:22.82]Alright, let's see what they got.
[73:24.55]Right in the middle, let's go right up front.
[73:27.47]Started off with drift.
[73:29.97]God, I fucking crushed him again.
[73:31.07]Right, don't even let him do nothing.
[73:31.99]Don't let him do anything.
[73:32.81]Again.
[73:34.34]He blocked it.
[73:35.46]Again.
[73:38.22]See you later.
[73:39.42]Champion.
[73:53.09]The winner of this terrific battle is Vroomr.
[73:56.03]Congratulations.
[73:56.91]I got really weird hands.
[74:05.87]The timing, yeah.
[74:07.91]800g and a potato.
[74:11.39]Plus 5 fame for Vroomr.
[74:16.89]He was so happy he just drove by the house.
[74:22.15]I'm convinced Jerma has a key to play the vroom noise.
[74:27.08]No.
[74:28.84]Nice work.
[74:29.94]Let's take a look at the schedule.
[74:33.76]Yeah, yeah, when's the next, uh, wait, wait, when's the next tournament?
[74:36.62]So I got a star.
[74:41.86]This is, uh, let's do, what's this one?
[74:43.70]This is a single official grade E tournament.
[74:46.36]This is the real one.
[74:48.54]I think I can enter this, though, because I have a star.
[74:53.03]Can I enter this?
[74:54.09]And just prepare for it?
[74:58.01]The monster does not have enough points to enter the official league battle.
[75:00.75]Ah, fuck off.
[75:02.37]Let's do this one.
[75:06.00]We just have to stomp on people.
[75:10.66]Alright, let's take a look at the schedule.
[75:12.86]Let's do exercise and then rest.
[75:17.20]Now, exercise, exercise, exercise, rest.
[75:21.41]No, no, no, no.
[75:22.39]Hold on.
[75:23.05]I'm getting into this here.
[75:25.05]Hold on.
[75:28.07]No, no, no.
[75:29.93]What does he need?
[75:33.33]Defense is terrible.
[75:34.17]Speed is terrible.
[75:41.33]I'm gonna... Let's do defense, defense.
[75:52.82]Defense.
[75:55.44]Defense.
[75:57.18]But defense, rest.
[75:59.62]Defense.
[76:00.82]Let him have a day off in the middle.
[76:08.64]And then that night is the tournament.
[76:12.93]You can have up to four monsters?
[76:15.43]I thought, uh... I don't know if I had that unlocked yet.
[76:20.01]Okay, that looks good.
[76:22.70]Do I have food?
[76:23.32]I have like a potato.
[76:26.28]I just got my first money.
[76:28.26]Alright, go for it.
[76:33.10]Not that great.
[76:35.57]Plus three defense.
[76:42.61]This is like a fucking goofball.
[76:46.57]What a goofy motherfucker.
[76:47.86]Alright, let's do an okay, let's price.
[76:53.34]Scold?
[76:55.96]Well, it's not his fault.
[76:57.62]He's like big, dumb, and slow.
[77:00.28]Well, like... He's not like the fastest.
[77:02.88]He can't sprint around.
[77:03.92]He uses his wheel.
[77:05.14]I can't be mad that he's like too slow.
[77:13.51]I'm spoiling him.
[77:14.39]Scold him!
[77:15.75]No, I don't want... He's my friend.
[77:17.09]I'm not gonna scold him.
[77:19.89]Alright, food cannot- oh shit, I can only do- I only- uh oh, that's not good.
[77:27.77]I can only- why can't I feed him?
[77:34.24]I can only do one action and feeding them is an action.
[77:38.90]That's not good.
[77:39.58]Okay, well... The tournament is... tomorrow.
[77:47.56]So let's feed him.
[77:53.77]Make him fear you.
[77:54.89]Hey, you want to run your monster village the way you want?
[77:58.50]I'm going to run my monster village the way I want.
[77:59.94]Plus, this is like kind of... This is like a little janky looking... See what I'm talking about here?
[78:32.44]That looks weird.
[78:33.10]There we go.
[78:35.46]Okay, that's better.
[78:37.90]Now it's not a bunch of, like, black bars.
[78:42.13]Now you can see better, can't you?
[78:43.55]He's not very focused.
[78:47.71]Uh, all I have is a potato.
[79:01.45]That focused lively.
[79:04.03]I think he's good to go.
[79:10.65]So then this is the... Is this the right week?
[79:13.34]No, okay, it's tomorrow.
[79:14.96]Yeah, it's tomorrow.
[79:19.20]Uh, yeah, he's in that one.
[79:21.32]Alright, we're good.
[79:27.27]He's not dead, he's fine.
[79:32.69]Keep up the good work!
[79:34.38]I brought some treats today!
[79:35.44]Here, give the snack to the monster!
[79:36.92]Free food, good.
[79:38.16]Don't forget to feed your monsters, we'll do your best.
[79:42.28]Two potatoes.
[79:44.40]Two mangoes.
[79:45.06]A squid.
[79:46.86]And a beef.
[79:59.71]You come with the same... grocery list.
[80:03.85]Alright, you're not hungry, you're not tired, you're pretty focused.
[80:07.61]And today was what?
[80:13.14]Today was training.
[80:14.16]This is for, I believe, defense, right?
[80:19.98]That's good.
[80:21.18]Good.
[80:23.66]Five points.
[80:26.01]Are you tired?
[80:26.97]No, not really.
[80:28.49]Very lively.
[80:30.01]Very lively.
[80:33.28]Alright, let's go.
[80:34.38]I'm not gonna do anything.
[80:37.16]He's ready to fight.
[80:39.39]I think we have to win two or three of these before we can do the official tournament.
[81:01.86]Ladies and gentlemen, representing the Bamboo Cup.
[81:07.18]Who will arise victorious?
[81:08.18]There can only be one.
[81:10.18]Let the tournament begin.
[81:14.09]Groomer, Kylon, Gatti, and Yellow.
[81:18.05]Let's see.
[81:21.03]Oh, fuck.
[81:21.45]This is not good.
[81:22.11]Okay.
[81:22.97]Really high intelligence.
[81:26.38]Low defense, though.
[81:27.10]I think if I get two or three quick moves off.
[81:29.78]Like that.
[81:31.89]Probably bury him.
[81:33.99]My intelligence is awful.
[81:37.32]He's got Tail Whip, Spit, and Kiss.
[81:43.32]Kiss is the thing you want to look out for.
[81:44.50]That's the only thing that does intelligence damage.
[81:46.64]So wherever Kiss is on his slot... Wait a minute.
[81:51.73]I'm not even fighting this.
[81:52.65]Alright, well, good luck everybody.
[81:59.21]No, what?
[81:59.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[82:00.79]Shit, I wanted to give commands.
[82:02.02]I hate when it does that.
[82:06.28]He's gonna, now he's on his own.
[82:13.61]I wanted to look at the other menu for a second, but alright, good luck.
[82:16.33]Good luck, Vroomer.
[82:17.85]Don't get hit by anything.
[82:22.01]Good job.
[82:23.33]I'm so glad you're doing this.
[82:25.89]I would have reacted five times faster than you.
[82:27.93]Come on, do it again.
[82:28.81]Quick.
[82:29.41]Don't let him do anything.
[82:30.47]Kill him.
[82:31.79]Don't let him do his move.
[82:32.41]He's going to do the spit.
[82:33.29]Do it.
[82:34.67]Do something.
[82:37.03]Do it quick before you die.
[82:38.33]Do it.
[82:40.36]Stop shifting.
[82:42.50]Oh, thank God.
[82:52.34]That almost was a disaster, okay.
[82:58.14]Don't yell at him.
[83:06.14]Gatti just destroyed Cailan.
[83:10.20]So Gatti's the one with the one win.
[83:13.30]And it's the person we're about to face.
[83:15.28]No we're not.
[83:16.90]Cailan versus Yalo.
[83:20.24]Alright, so Yalo just sucks.
[83:22.83]The high intelligence doesn't really matter at all.
[83:24.39]Alright, here we go.
[83:27.92]Info.
[83:30.22]Gaddy.
[83:33.56]Stats are very low.
[83:35.54]Just fast.
[83:36.88]But sometimes it's all it takes.
[83:55.14]Is this the evolved version of the monster that I had, but without legs?
[84:03.02]It looks like it.
[84:03.80]It looks like Snoopy's cousin.
[84:06.34]But with no legs.
[84:07.58]Spike.
[84:09.62]That just is Fireman.
[84:10.84]No, it wouldn't.
[84:11.28]If he had no arms, it would be.
[84:16.11]No, he does have legs.
[84:18.95]No, not good.
[84:19.87]Break it up, break it up, break it up.
[84:27.05]You missed.
[84:28.13]You just... That was a yo-yo.
[84:31.27]No, don't let him... Alright, get in close and hit him with a drift.
[84:34.97]He blocked it.
[84:35.69]Oh, fuck.
[84:36.15]Back it up, back it up.
[84:38.63]I need more guts.
[84:41.89]I haven't hit anything.
[84:43.19]That's not good!
[84:45.95]Get it!
[84:47.01]Yes!
[84:47.83]One-hit kill.
[84:49.77]Do it again!
[84:50.09]I just made him mad.
[84:53.47]Again?
[84:53.74]No!
[84:56.67]I got plenty of guts still, it's okay.
[85:05.23]Is it the speed or the defense?
[85:06.41]He's blocking everything.
[85:08.55]Holy shit, man.
[85:14.27]I'm almost out of guts.
[85:15.91]He's just gonna wear me down.
[85:20.90]Oh shit.
[85:21.78]Okay, I have to hit him here.
[85:24.76]Hit it!
[85:26.52]Yes!
[85:27.14]Hurry!
[85:34.94]Alright, that's 2-0.
[85:40.11]That's pretty much tournament victory as long as... Yeah, pretty much win.
[85:46.43]Gaddy and Yalo.
[85:49.15]Gaddy loses.
[85:51.57]Yeah, that's it.
[85:52.13]That's game over.
[85:52.97]I win.
[85:55.22]The only way it's possible is if I lose to Kylon.
[85:57.90]Which, I mean, that's not gonna happen.
[86:07.05]Well, it might.
[86:07.65]168 accuracy, 133 speed.
[86:10.91]Terrible power, though.
[86:12.89]Kylon's moves are awful.
[86:15.09]It's just a question of not being able to hit them.
[86:26.71]53 power.
[86:27.39]Yeah, but my defense is bad too, though.
[86:30.43]So... It'll still hurt.
[86:33.05]Alright, it's Vrimur versus Umbrella Head Dog.
[86:40.67]Alright, we want to stay away from the one in the back.
[86:48.22]Got it.
[86:50.66]Damn.
[86:58.38]There it is.
[86:58.78]Do it again, quick.
[86:59.44]Don't even let him do anything.
[87:00.36]Again.
[87:02.50]Again!
[87:02.86]No, fuck.
[87:05.92]Alright.
[87:07.24]I gotta learn a new move.
[87:10.80]The stupid drift.
[87:18.36]That's a victory.
[87:24.14]The winner of this terrific battle is Gromo.
[87:26.14]Congratulations.
[87:38.02]On cue.
[87:39.46]I'm not doing that.
[87:41.07]I'm not pressing a button to have a loud engine sound.
[87:45.81]Got a banana this time.
[87:48.56]Five more fame points.
[87:59.57]If Rumor is better than Beanbag Sonic, then that's debatable.
[88:05.03]Nice work.
[88:07.15]So, I think... Let me see.
[88:09.05]I have two stars now.
[88:10.11]What does it take?
[88:10.99]Official Cup?
[88:13.20]No, I need three stars.
[88:16.04]When's the next Official Cup?
[88:18.06]Oh, Jesus.
[88:21.68]Official Grade E. When's the next Official Grade E?
[88:24.44]Oh, no.
[88:28.67]It's not till October.
[88:31.59]He's gonna die.
[88:34.19]Um... Yeah, I'm gonna have to wait.
[88:38.75]Wait, you mean this July?
[88:40.87]No.
[88:41.29]Like, there's no end... There's this one here, but I don't have enough.
[88:45.35]We have to wait till October.
[88:47.53]Dammit.
[88:48.25]Alright.
[88:48.67]Well... Freeze him?
[88:58.93]I don't know.
[88:59.23]Do you think I should freeze him now?
[89:00.59]He's doing so well.
[89:03.87]We got plenty of time to make more.
[89:10.85]Not in his prime.
[89:11.86]Yeah.
[89:14.16]Let's take a... Let me see the... What do we need to build on here?
[89:19.24]Power is good.
[89:19.90]Defense could... Level 6 defense is probably important.
[89:23.86]Speed is pretty terrible as well.
[89:25.04]Intelligence is terrible.
[89:27.23]Although I might get another move if I level up power again.
[89:33.68]I think.
[89:33.96]I'm gonna try to get power to level 9.
[89:38.56]Maybe life?
[89:42.14]The life is bad too.
[89:44.13]Speed.
[89:44.61]There's so many things he needs.
[89:45.81]Let's schedule it out.
[89:51.47]Alright, let's do... We have like two months to get him there.
[89:58.78]Let's do speed.
[89:59.86]Speed.
[90:03.04]Then... Do speed twice.
[90:06.25]And then power.
[90:07.21]Rest.
[90:08.71]Ah, rest in the middle of that.
[90:15.67]Yeah, then we'll see where we're at.
[90:22.42]Put in the stupid invader's disk.
[90:26.74]I have that here.
[90:27.46]I have a bunch of stuff.
[90:28.62]That's a good increase.
[90:32.53]Alright, let's feed you.
[90:39.91]We doing okay?
[90:43.73]Banana.
[90:44.31]Sweet, nutritious banana from the Parepare jungle.
[90:47.41]Popular with kids.
[90:49.46]Squid, beef.
[90:50.62]Uh, let's just... potato.
[90:52.70]Let's save the good food for when we need it.
[91:00.03]I do have Floygan Brothers as well, you're right.
[91:03.50]Yeah, let's continue.
[91:10.54]Floygan Brothers disk or Riot.
[91:17.90]Yeah, I'm gonna turn the webcam on, just break it and have it.
[91:20.62]What was the training today?
[91:28.27]Just, uh, speed.
[91:30.34]Alright.
[91:31.18]Plus six.
[91:38.00]Mmm, tired.
[91:38.74]Good thing tomorrow's rest, right?
[91:40.06]Put the other monster ranchers in.
[91:51.66]Yeah, there's a lot of options.
[91:53.30]Once we get, like, a decent... Because, look, how this game really functions is... You build up a monster, you make them good, you make them win, you get, like, some good... A good start.
[92:04.98]You freeze them, you make more, and then you combine them... To make a better one.
[92:12.47]In the freezer.
[92:12.89]Is he gonna start to rebel?
[92:19.01]He's okay.
[92:25.55]I can't believe the bootleg Space Channel 5 bullshit.
[92:29.81]Okay, so he's tired.
[92:30.73]Today he was resting, right?
[92:38.82]So, rest, then it was power, rest, and then... Let's do defense twice.

[95:47.03]Let me see the schedule.
[95:48.51]Alright, so... Calendar.

[96:05.33]We're here.
[96:06.67]We'll just do this one.
[96:08.43]We'll go... We'll go just make fools out of everybody here.
[96:12.98]We'll go embarrass everyone here.
[96:14.48]Probably get booed and shit, but whatever.
[96:15.80]Who cares?
[96:17.78]Making money, right?
[96:18.48]Okay, he signed up for that one.
[96:25.87]Let's get out of here.
[96:36.69]Training!
[96:39.07]What were you doing today?
[96:41.23]Defense, right?
[96:45.52]Very good.
[96:50.88]He's very tired.
[96:51.72]You gotta get three stars?
[97:00.86]Why would they boo?
[97:03.02]Um... Because I'm going in there with a very strong Pokémon.
[97:07.90]the strongest it's possible alright we need a day of rest fail oh no fall it's like how did I fail rest
[97:35.42]Who cares if people like you if you're making cheddar?
[97:40.67]Well, I mean... I need money.
[97:43.93]This is a game about money.
[97:45.77]Let's feed you a potato.
[97:49.35]And then let's go kick some ass.
[97:52.17]And then after I kick everybody's ass in this tournament... I'm gonna go pee.
[98:01.88]Competition.
[98:03.70]Take part in the competition.
[98:12.23]We've got Clay, Dekker, and Chara.
[98:21.40]Look at Chara's icon.
[98:22.06]That looks fucking terrifying.
[98:40.01]What an extreme emoji.
[98:41.48]Alright.
[98:41.84]Let's see.
[98:42.82]This is clay.
[98:44.86]It's just a chump.
[98:45.98]I'll kill it in two hits.
[98:53.77]You know what?
[98:54.35]One hit, probably.
[98:57.08]This is the equivalent.
[98:57.76]Okay, you know when you play Little League and some of the coaches and some of the parents, the age range for Little League was like 10 to 13 years old.
[99:10.03]And there was the people that wanted to have their 15-year-old pretend to be a 12-year-old and be on teams and just decimate.
[99:15.89]It was bullshit.
[99:17.59]I don't know why people wanted to do that.
[99:19.97]But that's what we're doing right now.
[99:24.25]We're faking to be like a 10 year old as like a 14 year old.
[99:30.07]Like look, that didn't even hurt.
[99:35.24]Come on.
[99:37.74]You ain't got nothing on them for over.
[99:45.89]I want to end this with like me killing this creature.
[99:51.89]Nothing.
[99:52.81]There we go.
[99:55.30]No!
[99:57.58]I want to do such overkill.
[99:59.18]Yeah, there we go.
[100:02.38]He's fighting infants.
[100:05.24]Yeah, I don't know.
[100:05.74]I don't understand.
[100:06.86]He's batting 688.
[100:08.28]He has 48 home runs.
[100:13.84]He reaches base almost 8 out of 10 times he's at the plate.
[100:18.20]He's really, he's like 5 feet tall than everybody.
[100:28.02]Decker moves on.
[100:30.34]I wanted to see that face, though.
[100:33.03]Chara looks really interesting.
[100:34.07]I wanted to see who it was.
[100:34.87]This is Decker.
[100:37.55]Decker's actually pretty strong.
[100:40.85]This is a scenario where whoever gets the first two hits is gonna win.
[100:48.13]159 power.
[100:50.53]Well, shit, that's not good.
[100:52.52]We have, yeah, we have the same build.
[100:58.31]Both bad defense, no intelligence though.
[101:06.19]Decker looks like a child's drawing of a Ninja Turtle.
[101:17.86]This is Michelangelo.
[101:18.84]Alright, no more fucking around.
[101:21.08]I actually have to get back to focus here.
[101:25.16]Whoever gets the first hit is gonna get it.
[101:26.88]Bingo.
[101:29.41]Nice.
[101:29.77]Alright, again.
[101:30.41]Quick.
[101:30.67]Don't even let it... Go, go, go, go, go.
[101:31.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[101:34.45]That's not good.
[101:35.57]Alright, I gotta get... I gotta kill it here.
[101:37.09]He's gotta die here.
[101:39.34]Oh, this is bad.
[101:39.98]Back it up.
[101:41.08]Back it up!
[101:42.18]Do it!
[101:43.14]No!
[101:44.46]No!
[101:45.06]Please!
[101:46.20]I win.
[101:49.96]We both have the philosophy of... Try to kill people in one hit, or two hits, or you lose.
[101:56.89]Alright, we got three under our belt now.
[101:59.05]Time for an official championship.
[102:04.79]I thought we should go to town and buy some stuff.
[102:07.23]We can buy items.
[102:09.83]Oh, Jesus.
[102:12.47]Uh, KDK.
[102:14.01]KDKD.

[102:36.58]Alright, KD.
[102:38.90]Well, it's KDKD.
[102:41.50]It's KDK.
[102:45.82]But thank you, KD.
[102:46.48]I'll call you KD from now on.

[107:48.63]Give me a second.
[108:23.11]Well, I don't know what's going on with the internet, but... It's... Apparently, I've got like a bright red bar right now.
[108:29.97]Strangely enough.
[108:31.05]Um... More subs came in?
[108:35.82]Oh my goodness, thank you.

[108:59.14]I'm dropping, like, so many frames at the moment.
[109:02.40]It seems to be.
[109:02.88]Is it okay now?
[109:03.48]I think it's alright now.
[109:10.25]Well, it might be one of those days, apparently.
[109:12.53]For some reason.
[109:15.56]But, uh, thank you.
[109:17.02]That's, like, 200 fucking subs today.
[109:19.55]150, something like that.

[109:23.29]Balla Koala, KD.
[109:25.61]Thank you both.
[109:29.57]Let's keep going.
[109:31.41]Let's level up our wheel skunk.
[109:34.11]I don't even know what the hell this thing is.
[109:41.62]Alright, so today's the day, right?
[109:44.71]No, no, no.
[109:45.13]Today's not the day.
[109:45.83]Today we... Calendar.
[109:46.99]Here we go.
[109:50.15]This is the one I'm signing up for.
[109:51.77]Six battles.
[109:53.91]Sign up for it.
[109:54.61]I want to be prepared for this.
[109:55.61]So we got... A couple here.
[110:01.81]We have one, two, three, four, four.
[110:03.61]We got about four or five weeks.
[110:04.76]Let's rest up.
[110:05.64]And get to D rank.
[110:14.21]Hopefully, we get there.
[110:18.33]So let's start with, uh, no, no, no, what's our schedule?
[110:21.67]High jump, yeah.
[110:23.03]High jump, high jump, rest.
[110:25.41]And then we're gonna do exercise.
[110:26.91]That sounds good.
[110:28.33]Tournament's here.
[110:29.83]Let's rest... here.
[110:35.56]Work your ass off for a couple days.
[110:39.24]And then rest on the day of the tournament as well.
[110:41.12]Alright, I think that's a good schedule.
[110:44.40]Begin.
[110:49.66]Plus 10 speed, that's really good.
[110:51.22]Let me see here.
[110:55.06]Have a potato.
[110:58.50]20 more community subs!
[111:01.92]From KD.
[111:14.91]KD.
[111:16.21]What on Earth?
[111:19.53]20 more.
[111:20.61]115 total.
[111:22.62]Holy shit, dude.
[111:25.90]That's a ton.
[111:26.78]Thank you so much for the 20 more fucking community subs.
[111:32.82]Holy shit.
[111:42.61]I hate this monster for no reason.
[111:44.77]Why?
[111:45.07]Why do you hate this one?
[112:05.01]I like this one.
[112:05.69]I mean, it is kind of big on the screen, but still.
[112:12.41]You don't like Smoochie from Death to Smoochie?
[112:15.91]That's what it looks like.
[112:16.59]Alright, looks good.
[112:22.05]Let's go.
[112:31.42]10 more speed.
[112:32.08]Speed, he's doing... Alright, he's very good with speed.
[112:39.78]He's very, very attentive to how fast he can go.
[112:42.66]I mean, he does have a wheel, so that makes sense.
[112:49.14]Alright, you can rest.
[112:54.96]That's a Boomer reference?
[112:57.56]That's not a Boomer reference.
[113:02.59]How is that a Boomer reference?
[113:03.81]It's like... It's like a Danny DeVito movie.
[113:07.07]You guys love Danny DeVito.
[113:08.19]He's still relevant.
[113:14.23]Alright, rest, right?
[113:16.83]No, rest here.
[113:21.91]And then do power.
[113:24.19]And then... Sounds pretty good.
[113:26.81]I'm ready.
[113:30.67]Go to sleep.
[113:33.80]You sketch.
[113:37.34]You just did the sloppy Joe thing.
[113:38.56]I love that lady.
[113:40.18]That's my favorite character probably ever.
[113:45.08]I know you get like a sloppy.
[113:50.08]Hey lady, you're scaring us.
[113:56.35]Billy Madison, come on.
[114:01.65]The lady.
[114:03.71]The lunch lady from Billy Madison.
[114:08.67]Wow, I... I am old apparently.
[114:15.30]Alright, what do you need?
[114:16.08]Nothing?
[114:16.68]No, you don't need food.
[114:17.32]You're good.
[114:18.52]Somebody just said it took me 20 days to finish the Seaman boss.
[114:35.31]Why?
[114:35.75]Is that because... Is it because you didn't like it?
[114:39.63]Were you forcing yourself to watch it?
[114:43.79]Keeping up the good work!
[114:46.05]Okay, this guy just brings food.
[114:50.09]The last game you had to buy food.
[114:51.71]I have a surplus of food.
[114:54.52]This guy just keeps bringing the same recipes every day.
[114:57.00]Or every month.
[114:58.12]Or every, like, couple months.
[114:58.90]I don't even know.
[114:59.38]Every season?
[114:59.98]20 days.
[115:04.16]Alright, we got two trains, and then a rest.
[115:14.39]Or should I try to get power to level 10?
[115:15.65]And just go absolute fucking hammer.
[115:24.12]What do you think?
[115:25.52]Hmm.
[115:28.74]I think we're gonna do power again.
[115:31.38]Yeah, I wanna get to level 10.
[115:43.97]Rest, and then that's the official tournament.
[115:46.59]Come on, level 10 power.
[115:47.41]Give me a new move.
[115:50.97]Yes!
[115:51.65]New move.
[115:54.85]Give me a new move.
[115:55.65]How do you learn new moves in this game?
[116:05.20]Uh, yeah, no big deal.
[116:06.58]Just another 20 community subs from Katie.
[116:09.76]Again.
[116:09.94]20 more.
[116:15.97]Holy shit, man.
[116:16.89]20 more.
[116:21.07]Let's give him some food.
[116:22.79]I can't.
[116:23.59]I can do it tomorrow.
[116:27.37]KD must have robbed a bank.
[116:35.70]This game looks like it's Sekiro, but good.
[116:37.70]What?
[116:41.26]How?
[116:41.48]What are you...
[116:44.30]This game looks like Sekiro.
[116:45.90]Five more from Katie!
[116:49.68]Five more community subs to top it all off.
[116:55.64]Holy shit.
[116:57.80]Thank you, Katie.
[117:03.60]His bank is gonna block his card.
[117:17.00]Bill Gates.
[117:20.02]Some of you guys have given, like, extreme amounts of money.
[117:25.77]How about some beef?
[117:26.89]Yeah!
[117:29.89]Before the tournament, let's carb up.
[117:32.35]He didn't like that.
[117:40.92]It's because he's a vegan.
[117:43.79]Well, he's focused now.
[117:44.89]He's just having a rest.
[117:45.67]He's fine.
[117:47.93]Yeah, he's ready to go, right?
[117:48.77]Let's make sure.
[117:50.65]Yeah.
[117:51.47]No, he's ready.
[117:53.35]Let's go.
[117:54.69]First official tournament.
[117:57.74]Six rivals, $1,000.
[118:00.30]Carrot for an item.
[118:02.30]Official grade E. Let's move out of grade E.
[118:09.21]Ten more subs from JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[118:13.93]You guys are just playing like sub-asteroids right now with each other.
[118:19.89]Thank you, both of you.
[118:25.52]The official grade rank E tournament.
[118:27.44]The winner of this tournament will receive a voucher for rank D. Let's give it our best.
[118:32.64]Begin the official grade rank E. Here we go.
[118:37.83]Vroomer, Harris, Smollett, Judith, Lefort, and Sunny.
[118:42.98]This is against Sunny.
[118:49.38]Low intelligence, low accuracy.
[118:53.61]Really high power and high health.
[118:57.13]What about me?
[119:00.29]I've got really high power, really kind of low health.
[119:06.09]That's going to be the downfall for me, I think.
[119:07.47]I've got to start to level that up.
[119:08.90]And intelligence.
[119:09.56]Alright.
[119:12.54]Let me see, what do you get for moves?
[119:17.24]High power, so that means you want to be getting in... Alright, he's got a lot of moves.
[119:24.50]This is going to be tough.
[119:26.49]Let's see if I can get a couple of hits on him.
[119:40.56]Did I... Okay.
[119:48.18]You're dead.
[119:49.44]Your spine is going to shatter.
[119:53.16]Why did I come off a pirate ship?
[119:57.39]Oh no, it's a Sonic.
[119:59.77]It's Sunny the Sonic Dog.
[120:05.35]This is some rivalry here.
[120:09.74]Here we go.
[120:12.82]Start it off, uh, quick!
[120:16.82]Nice.
[120:17.12]Let me see if I can finish it with the, uh, with the backspin.
[120:20.74]Try it again.
[120:27.00]Oooh, not good.
[120:31.51]Get in close.
[120:34.67]Yes!
[120:35.19]Ugh.
[120:36.47]Final guts?
[120:37.21]What the fuck does that mean?
[120:38.61]What?
[120:39.98]Oh, not good.
[120:42.80]He, thank god, he revived and I still got him.
[120:49.95]Final Guts.
[120:51.73]That's like some weird technique.
[120:53.65]He's gonna be hard.
[120:57.27]Come back with one health.
[121:00.46]Aris versus the Fort.
[121:02.70]Ooh, the Fort just beat Aris.
[121:04.32]0 and 1.
[121:05.88]Alright, these two.
[121:08.46]Judith and Smollett.
[121:12.09]Pretty, uh, one-sided fight there.
[121:16.46]Lefort and Judith... Me, Lefort, and Judith are the only ones that have wins.
[121:24.08]That just went to... time, I think.
[121:27.20]Sunny wins.
[121:29.76]Alright, here we go.
[121:30.92]So now it's... we get to see one of these weirdos.
[121:34.57]Rumor versus Lefort.
[121:35.61]Wrong thing.
[121:42.95]That's a ton of intelligence, I have to avoid all those int moves.
[121:45.81]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR, just gave 15 community subs, 10 and then 5.
[121:51.43]More.
[121:53.77]15 more subs.
[121:55.61]Just dropping them everywhere.
[121:58.57]You're just driving by in a blimp.
[122:02.03]The two of you, the three of you tonight.
[122:04.30]Are just slowly going by in a blimp and throwing out, like, $10 bills over, like, a crowd.
[122:18.30]But then, but then I come in with a vacuum.
[122:21.86]And I... I have a giant, like, fucking Dr. Eggman vacuum that I suck up all the money.
[122:27.97]And I stand at a podium and go, But here are emotes!
[122:31.35]And everyone's like fucking screaming at me, That was, wait, wait, that was my fucking money!
[122:47.72]Adventure Dan.
[122:48.72]Thank you, Adventure MF Dan.
[122:53.60]Stop taking their money.
[122:55.98]This guy's gonna kill us if... I need to be aware of this intelligent move.
[123:00.63]The green moves try to stay away from them.
[123:06.37]Thank you so much, Adventure Dan.
[123:10.26]Where's my fucking money, Dan?
[123:15.00]Put on face cam?
[123:17.27]Dude, I wish we had... one of these, like, pumpkin ducks.
[123:23.23]What is this?
[123:27.80]That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[123:29.44]Alright, intelligence move is not on the list right now.
[123:35.92]See if we can get it.
[123:39.26]Do it again.
[123:39.64]Don't even lend it.
[123:40.20]Not even a chance.
[123:40.94]Dead.
[123:44.07]No, he blocked it with his body.
[123:48.51]I'm gonna take a hit here.
[123:50.11]Not staying close, he didn't have a move close.
[123:51.69]Fuck.
[123:54.88]Goodbye.
[124:01.77]Go back to Cuphead.
[124:16.00]Imagine gifting subs in 2019.
[124:18.42]Laughing my ass off.
[124:19.34]What?
[124:24.84]I think Sunny is going to be the one we have to fight in the championship here.
[124:30.09]It's all about the power.
[124:30.95]Alright, Judith.
[124:34.05]What do you got?
[124:37.57]An exceptionally high intelligence.
[124:41.88]To a point where I would probably get one-shot by any of the int moves.
[124:45.34]What do you have for intelligence moves, though?
[124:47.10]That's the question.
[124:51.57]Almost everything.
[124:54.17]So... All those green moves are devastating to me.
[125:01.18]I have to try to keep in the range of Windy Lance, whatever it is.
[125:10.59]Uh, Chunky Bologna, 50 bucks from Chunky Bologna.
[125:14.44]Thank you for the 5,000 bits, Chunky Bologna.
[125:18.36]I tried to donate this money to the local animal shelter, but your vacuum sucked it up.
[125:26.75]Come on.
[125:30.03]My, like, money vacuum.
[125:31.91]Get in close.
[125:38.87]Everything she has is an intelligent... I gotta just try to end this quick.
[125:41.87]No, this is bad.
[125:44.81]All the way in the back.
[125:47.65]She's got nothing for... She's got no long-range moves.
[125:49.59]I only have a 27% chance to hit with this.
[125:52.88]Holy shit, I got it.
[125:55.12]This is just a Hail Mary right here.
[125:56.22]I have to do it.
[125:58.86]Mm-mm.
[126:01.84]Stay far away, stay still.
[126:02.88]Let me build up some guts.
[126:04.47]Do it.
[126:06.05]No!
[126:08.53]Alright, let's get back in close, back in close.
[126:13.74]In close again.
[126:16.30]Back it up, back it up, back it up!
[126:17.50]I will do a war here.
[126:20.84]No!
[126:24.44]Fuck, I'm getting close!
[126:29.99]All it takes is one move.
[126:31.15]No, shit!
[126:34.11]Oh, I'm 18 seconds.
[126:41.82]No, please.
[126:47.00]Stay back.
[126:47.94]Stay back.
[126:49.16]Get in close.
[126:51.06]Five, four, three, two... Whoa!
[126:56.26]I win.
[126:59.98]Wait, it's percentage based, right?
[127:02.35]Yes, I win.
[127:08.57]Don't waste guts.
[127:10.08]Yeah, I just... I saw the... I saw the opportunity.
[127:18.69]20 more subs from Katie.
[127:22.65]Oh my god.
[127:27.14]Jesus Christ.
[127:29.28]That's so many.
[127:29.96]I'm trying to have everybody be a sub on the whole channel.
[127:35.72]But thanks, Katie.
[127:37.46]That's a fucking extreme amount of money.
[127:42.68]These are the two... What's going to happen here?
[127:44.30]Let's see.
[127:44.56]The forward's going to win.
[127:45.44]$600.
[127:45.46]That's a fucking ton of money.
[128:07.41]We've seen some huge sub and bit drops on this channel.
[128:11.86]I can't fucking believe it every time.
[128:13.58]Thank you, guys.
[128:16.96]Harris versus Judith.
[128:21.60]And who's the... Sunny is the... Okay, let's see.
[128:24.94]If Sunny wins this fight, then they're gonna be the championship fighter.
[128:31.37]And they just barely did.
[128:34.19]Alright.
[128:35.49]So, it's gonna come down to, I just can't lose.
[128:38.15]Smollett has not won a single match.
[128:40.93]This is gonna be probably fairly easy.
[128:44.80]I don't know why though, look at this!
[128:48.48]These stats are actually really good, except for power.
[128:54.02]Muhaha is one of their moves that's deadly.
[128:56.90]Why would you lose every fight?
[128:58.02]Is it just the power?
[128:59.50]Is it just not good at all?
[129:17.10]Smollett.
[129:19.44]It's just a rabbit.
[129:23.74]See if I can one-shot.
[129:27.64]Oh, no.
[129:31.42]Okay.
[129:34.86]Guts down, and I'll just do it back-to-back here.
[129:37.48]High speed, so it would be really easy to... I only have 35% chance to get in here.
[129:46.84]Oh yeah, you're terrible.
[129:52.06]You are awful.
[129:56.59]23 damage?
[129:57.79]My defense isn't even that good.
[130:01.23]Alright, Lefort, beat him.
[130:01.97]Dammit.
[130:08.77]Uh... Let's see... Smollett just destroyed Harris.
[130:15.22]That means Harris is...
[130:18.60]I guess they both pretty bad, so it doesn't matter.
[130:23.98]That's close.
[130:25.90]Alright, Aris.
[130:28.93]This is a guaranteed championship if I win.
[130:32.37]No, it's not.
[130:33.09]If Sonny wins his next match.
[130:34.41]No, I mean, it pretty much is.
[130:37.84]Let's see what we got.
[130:41.24]Nothing really spectacular.
[130:48.78]Welcome to JermaCraft.
[130:51.35]Why JermaCraft?
[130:56.89]I like those little Loch Ness monsters.
[131:00.11]I want one of these.
[131:00.65]Okay, we got 50% chance to hit here.
[131:08.46]Uh-oh.
[131:10.70]Blocked it.
[131:23.00]That was embarrassing.
[131:26.52]That was embarrassing.
[131:28.22]Didn't even do anything.
[131:29.30]Uh, I feel bad.
[131:33.94]Can I buy Harris from this trainer?
[131:36.44]I feel like I would take better care of Harris.
[131:42.29]The winner is Groomer, moving on to Class D.
[131:51.73]He's trying his best, yeah.
[131:57.35]1,000 gold prize carrot.
[131:59.41]Got more fame.
[132:00.62]Vroomer is now climbing the ranks.
[132:08.72]New monster.
[132:13.50]You can train up to four in your ranch.
[132:15.06]I think I might have to unlock that though.
[132:18.42]You won the official competition.
[132:20.75]Well, I guess my work is done.
[132:25.47]Done?
[132:25.77]What do you mean, Yuri?
[132:27.61]Well, my father wants me to come back and work at the store.
[132:31.21]I decided I would quit if you won the competition.
[132:33.61]That doesn't make any sense.
[132:38.89]Sorry I didn't tell you before.
[132:41.75]I wanted to beat TT before I quit.
[132:44.07]It's been a lot of fun, really.
[132:46.87]I see, but wait, you mean I have to take care of the ranch by myself?
[132:52.54]Hee hee, don't you worry, partner.
[132:53.88]I've got my replacement lined up and she's here!
[132:57.79]There you go, don't be shy, come on out now.
[132:59.65]Hi, er, hello.
[133:04.41]Huh?
[133:05.47]Is that you, Ryo?
[133:07.91]Yup, doesn't she look different?
[133:09.37]I was amazed too.
[133:10.31]What do you mean different?
[133:13.05]She has her hair in a ponytail.
[133:16.85]Really?
[133:17.17]I figured it would be easier to work with this outfit.
[133:21.30]Does it look alright?
[133:24.38]What's the difference?
[133:26.58]Of course, it looks great.
[133:29.15]So check this out.
[133:30.19]When I told Caesar I'd be moving on from my assistant position, Rio said she wanted to take over.
[133:36.55]Gosh, I was totally surprised.
[133:39.61]Wow, really?
[133:41.45]So it's okay then, right?
[133:42.85]You be a good girl, Rio.
[133:46.76]I always wanted to raise monsters on a ranch.
[133:50.80]When I heard about Yuri, I thought, this is my chance.
[133:56.52]This is my chance?
[133:57.52]Well, you said it.
[133:58.18]This is our chance.
[134:01.51]Yep, our chance.
[134:08.79]What a good boy.
[134:09.73]Who's a good boy?
[134:10.77]Who's a good boy?
[134:14.76]Who's a good boy?
[134:15.78]Yes, you are.
[134:17.88]Alright.
[134:19.74]You did a very good job.
[134:22.70]Let's save the game before I have a panic attack meltdown when it doesn't happen and the game crashes or something.
[134:39.17]Please end this stream forever.
[134:40.77]Why?
[134:43.25]Ended.
[134:44.50]Okay, so how... Let's go to the shrine.
[134:47.86]Can I... Let's get a new monster.
[134:50.40]Let's do it.
[134:54.94]Everything going well.
[134:56.16]What will it be?
[134:57.26]Create.
[134:59.30]You already have a monster you're erasing.
[135:01.78]What will it be?
[135:02.32]Yeah, how do... Somebody said I could... One guy told me that I could do four.
[135:10.05]Do I need a... I might have to get to a certain rank?
[135:17.07]I need to unlock the bigger ranch.
[135:18.19]Alright, well then rumor's gonna take us to the top, and then from there we're gonna get more.
[135:25.17]This is the next, like, six to ten weeks worth of streams, guys, so... Alright, let me take a look at what we need to work on here.
[135:39.24]Power's good.
[135:41.34]Accuracy could use some work.
[135:45.92]Everything intelligence could use to work.
[135:47.86]But I want 200 attack power.
[135:50.57]I want more accuracy.
[135:51.63]I don't like the 50% bullshit.
[135:53.59]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[135:54.95]10 more community subs.
[136:03.60]Back to back, they keep coming back and forth here.
[136:06.58]Thank you.
[136:08.92]Ugh.
[136:10.36]I haven't trained any life at all either.
[136:12.06]I know.
[136:15.74]It's true.
[136:16.28]It's too much to think about.
[136:18.28]Let's get a good schedule here then.
[136:22.87]Alright, I want... Let's do... I'm gonna do accuracy and life.
[136:33.33]Back and forth here.
[136:38.18]Day of rest.
[136:40.08]Life.
[136:40.28]Let's see how we go from there.
[136:45.63]Accuracy.
[136:46.09]Not good, but not great.
[137:08.33]I'm going to scold.
[137:12.62]I mean, we've been very, very, very... Focus is not that great either.
[137:26.55]Yeah, I know.
[137:27.49]Look, we've been very, very nice.
[137:31.01]We've praised every time.
[137:33.53]I don't want the monster to get to a point where they're, you know, getting lazy or anything.
[137:42.89]Hello there!
[137:43.37]Hello Yuri, what brings you here?
[137:47.78]Well, actually, there's somebody I want to introduce!
[137:51.24]To you!
[137:51.82]He's right over here!
[137:52.74]Hello!
[137:55.50]My name is Talt.
[137:56.36]I'm a monster... veter... veterinarian... veterinarian!
[138:00.46]I'm traveling around checking the health of monsters.
[138:05.04]Oh, nice to meet you.
[138:07.52]Tom came all the way from the faraway island of age.
[138:11.16]He's traveling the world for the sake of monsters everywhere.
[138:15.49]All around the world?
[138:16.27]That's incredible.
[138:18.33]Please, it's not that big of a deal.
[138:20.05]Oops, I'm sorry.
[138:20.73]I interrupted your monster caretaking.
[138:23.65]No, it's no problem at all.
[138:26.51]But then I'll be heading to the other ranches.
[138:28.68]Goodbye, bye.
[138:30.68]If you're ever in the neighborhood again, please feel free to stop by.
[138:34.22]Okay, goodbye.
[138:38.46]What a nice person.
[138:39.28]I can sense his love for monsters.
[138:41.82]So there are other people in the world like Fane, aren't there?
[138:45.96]I gotta get out of here.
[138:47.15]I gotta go.
[138:52.43]This ranch is just like I expected it would be.
[138:54.69]Hello, anybody home?
[138:56.03]Yeah, I'm the breeder at this ranch.
[138:59.17]Who are you?
[139:01.20]Excuse me, I'm Pollock.
[139:02.48]I'm a training gadget peddler.
[139:05.04]Training gadget?
[139:07.36]I saw your battle in the competition the other day.
[139:09.84]I guess you're not using training gadgets.
[139:11.78]I could tell.
[139:13.76]Wait just a minute here.
[139:14.86]What the heck is a training gadget?
[139:17.28]Oh, sorry.
[139:17.84]It is a fucking 50 community subs just came in.
[139:20.64]Somebody just blasted out like a thousand dollars.
[139:26.00]Hold on one minute.
[139:28.64]Uh, KD just gave 50 community subs.
[139:35.50]50 community subs.
[139:40.72]Oh my god.
[139:43.30]How many have you given tonight?
[139:44.74]Let me see.
[139:50.79]Quick math.
[139:53.85]Holy shit, man.
[139:59.16]One guy aims to gift all.
[140:05.52]Thank you.
[140:08.77]For the fucking... I don't even... That's a lot.
[140:15.41]The vacuum is overloaded.
[140:17.08]I have to, like, empty the vacuum.
[140:25.02]Thank you so much, man.
[140:28.86]Oh, sorry, Charlie.
[140:30.16]I'll start that again.
[140:32.85]Training gadgets.
[140:33.91]Well, gadgets that you use for training.
[140:36.86]In other words, they're machines that boost effective training.
[140:40.19]Everybody uses them.
[140:42.15]And you, my friend, have great potential.
[140:45.19]Why don't you try using the training gadget on your ranch?
[140:47.87]You'll soon be seeing even better results.
[140:50.85]Well, I'll come again later.
[140:52.09]Bye.
[140:55.15]Hmm.
[140:55.67]Using machines for training.
[140:57.48]What do you think, Rio?
[141:02.38]I'm going to change it to this.
[141:07.36]Training gadgets run off Geonite.
[141:10.80]Geonite is an energy of the Earth found in spirit trees, Eddie.
[141:15.28]It's found in spirit trees, Eddie.
[141:19.53]So you mean gadgets use energy from Mokroji, Eddie?
[141:26.59]Don't worry, I'm old enough to have saved up plenty of extra Geonite.
[141:33.20]Mokroji, don't overexert yourself.
[141:36.88]It's decided then.
[141:38.10]Let's try using training gadgets on our ranch.
[141:43.89]Quick refund to all the gift subs.
[141:46.73]Well, hello.
[141:49.61]Wrong guy.
[141:51.47]Well, hello!
[141:52.49]Been doing well?
[141:53.81]Have you decided- I can't- There's only so many anime fucking dub voices I know.
[141:57.61]I don't know any others.
[141:59.19]I know like four.
[142:02.05]Have you decided to try using training gadgets?
[142:04.85]I feel like I'm stuck in a time portal.
[142:08.83]Just give it to me.
[142:10.17]You really ought to give them a try.
[142:11.31]Feel free to take a look at them.
[142:15.67]What will you do?
[142:16.29]Alright, I- I don't know what these are.
[142:18.41]Pinman just gave 10 communities.
[142:23.07]Thank you, Pinman, for 10 community subs.
[142:25.69]Buy?
[142:26.89]Training effect?
[142:29.69]You don't have any appraised training gadgets.
[142:32.83]But thank you so much, Pinman.
[142:36.60]What will it do?
[142:37.16]Buy training.
[142:38.82]What will you buy?
[142:41.52]Oh.
[142:43.48]Look at this.
[142:46.16]Look at this.
[142:46.68]2,000 gold.
[142:49.10]Strength training.
[142:49.66]Get level 2.
[142:50.24]Space 1 by 2.
[142:53.44]Ooh.
[142:56.14]Alright.
[142:56.60]Alright.
[142:57.08]Okay.
[142:59.05]I'm thinking, uh, how much do they cost?
[143:03.23]They're like $2,000 each.
[143:04.17]I got $13,000.
[143:04.73]Dude, Droopy the dog.
[143:12.01]Okay.
[143:13.69]I'll try to do Droopy the dog.
[143:15.70]Boo.
[143:16.98]Boo, boo.
[143:17.84]Oh, no.
[143:18.58]Droopy.
[143:19.76]It's me, Droopy.
[143:21.30]Got it.
[143:25.33]I'm gonna go... I want... this one.
[143:29.83]Buy this.
[143:30.41]Yes.
[143:33.53]Thank you very much.
[143:35.14]Customize immediately.
[143:36.38]Uh, sure.
[143:38.50]Oh, I have to place it.
[143:44.07]Wait, what?
[143:45.83]Poor house, poor hut.
[143:55.95]Oh my god, this is huge.
[144:01.13]Poor streamer.
[144:03.68]Not tonight.
[144:08.64]Alright, then... Alright, we're gonna use that.
[144:16.95]Anything else to buy?
[144:17.93]Um, yeah.
[144:18.69]You guys are out of your minds.
[144:22.59]StudlyDoRight gave 20 community subs!
[144:30.83]Holy shit, guys.
[144:35.38]I'm spoiled rotten.
[144:41.64]Uh, what about tr- speed trampoline is one by one?
[144:44.91]That's- I- I can do that, right?
[144:47.75]No, that- no, no, no, it's not.
[144:49.21]I can't- can I?
[144:49.99]But thank you so much.
[144:57.40]I'm buying the speed one.
[145:01.62]I think I can fit this.
[145:02.66]It's 1x1, right?
[145:03.22]Yeah.
[145:03.38]Trampoline?
[145:03.72]Any more 1x1s?
[145:05.94]This is 1x2.
[145:06.69]1x2, 2x3, 1x1, 1x2.
[145:07.41]No.
[145:07.49]Alright, what else you got?
[145:08.97]Cell?
[145:33.09]What will you sell?
[145:33.57]Can I sell my house?
[145:36.23]No.
[145:37.23]Uh, Adventure MF Dan, five more subs.
[145:41.25]Five more subs from MF Dan.
[145:49.45]Money laundering screen.
[145:51.25]Holy shit.
[145:56.49]Alright, so now...
[146:01.49]Let's see, that was speed and accuracy.
[146:04.73]Let's go to the schedule.
[146:07.29]So we do, this is speed and accuracy, right?
[146:09.79]Yeah.
[146:13.38]Shadow box is accuracy and balance is speed, I believe.
[146:17.68]No, uh, ooh, ooh, look at this!
[146:20.74]Target.
[146:21.02]Ooh.
[146:21.36]Very cool.
[146:33.71]Target, and then... Trampoline.
[146:39.49]Target, trampoline, rest, trampoline.
[146:42.31]Got it.
[146:44.07]I'm excited for this one.
[146:46.39]We actually get to see him do a different animation.
[146:50.96]Nice.
[146:58.67]So you have to build up your ranch and they can use... This is cool.
[147:06.63]Nice work.
[147:07.09]Alright, you're very tired though and very hungry.
[147:12.33]Uh, food.
[147:12.81]Let's give you some... Let's give you a mango.
[147:21.72]I love mangoes.
[147:24.28]Frustrated?
[147:26.56]Well, you'll be fine.
[147:34.05]Vrumer is cute.
[147:34.85]Vrumer seems to be a little worried about something.
[147:38.37]Hmm, I wonder what's wrong.
[147:39.91]Oh, Caesar!
[147:41.79]Well, hello, Fane.
[147:42.95]I think I may know what's wrong.
[147:45.37]You see, for Vrumer, this ranch is like a home, with Fane as the father and Rio as the mother.
[147:52.70]And, well, Vrumer may need some friends.
[147:56.46]Oh, I get it.
[147:57.84]I liked school, but it would have been nothing without friends.
[148:01.76]So then, we have to get some more monsters.
[148:06.09]We might have to expand the hut.
[148:07.47]Things might get exciting around here.
[148:08.89]It should be fun.
[148:13.01]But with more monsters, you may have to expand the ranch itself.
[148:16.97]How about this?
[148:17.56]I'll ask a carpenter friend of mine.
[148:19.74]He should be able to get working on something right away.
[148:22.42]A carpenter?
[148:25.94]But we don't have any money.
[148:29.27]Oh boy, could you stop acting like a stranger?
[148:32.77]I know this will put a smile on your face, and to me that's worth more than anything in the world.
[148:39.52]Father, thank you.
[148:41.92]Well then, it's settled.
[148:42.96]Leave the rest to me.
[148:45.92]See ya.
[148:53.63]That's good.
[148:58.40]So now we get to make more monsters.
[149:00.22]Dude, what an epic November fail.
[149:11.34]Hello there, partner.
[149:12.32]Is Fane home?
[149:14.36]Fane, it's me.
[149:15.12]But who are you?
[149:17.13]Me?
[149:17.39]Oh, the name's you.
[149:18.17]I'm the carpenter that Caesar hired.
[149:21.01]You're the carpenter?
[149:24.47]You betcha I am.
[149:25.23]Now don't you worry about a thing.
[149:26.55]Leave it all to all you.
[149:28.72]To leave it to me?
[149:29.46]No, you.
[149:31.78]But, what?
[149:32.50]Okay, we's got us a ranch, a hut, and a rickety house.
[149:39.25]Okay, we'll have you a brand new ranch in one week.
[149:41.19]What?
[149:46.09]Her thanks.
[149:51.51]In one week, we have a new ranch.
[149:54.26]Oh, I'm so fucking excited now.
[149:56.82]Alright.
[149:58.28]Frustrated.
[149:58.78]Maybe you should jump on a trampoline.
[150:07.44]Plus 10 every time you do that.
[150:08.94]60% success rate, though.
[150:11.64]Alright, what's your favorite food?
[150:15.91]You don't have to do that with the tire.
[150:18.23]You can do it somewhere else.
[150:21.17]Alright, let's give you... Do I have to item anything?
[150:25.47]I have no items to give.
[150:27.75]You're doing a great job.
[150:32.72]Does the wheel feel pain?
[150:35.64]I don't know.
[150:36.00]I mean, the wheel is part of him.
[150:38.24]Alright, good job, Vroomer.
[150:43.27]Take the week off.
[150:59.10]Alrighty boys, that'll do it.
[151:00.34]Well, what do you think?
[151:01.60]Gives you a lot of space, huh?
[151:04.17]Wow, you, you're just my age, but you direct all those adults around like a true leader.
[151:11.29]Yeah, so cool.
[151:13.69]Oh, give me a break.
[151:14.39]I'm just doing my job.
[151:16.69]Now three monsters can live in the hut and you can store more gadgets in the house.
[151:22.27]So where would you like to put the house and hut?
[151:24.62]I'll place it wherever you like.
[151:28.23]Look at this real estate.
[151:29.81]Just fucking so big.
[151:31.80]Alright, this is what we need.
[151:33.84]Um, normal house.
[151:35.62]Up here.
[151:36.68]And then, normal hut.
[151:38.34]You can spin it around too.
[151:40.52]Um... I like it right here.
[151:41.90]Um...
[151:58.72]Okay, that means I got some more room here.
[152:00.26]Yeah, I don't want the house right next to the barn, you know what I mean?
[152:03.99]It'll smell.
[152:09.29]We can range friends for broomer.
[152:12.07]No problem at all, buddy.
[152:13.01]If you outgrow this hut, give me a holler anytime.
[152:16.54]The next time I charge the regular fucking raid, dude.
[152:19.06]See you later.
[152:23.41]I don't know what I'm doing.
[152:25.41]I'm gonna be completely honest here.
[152:27.05]Alright, let's go.
[152:28.91]So, let's go get some friends.
[152:36.21]What's the next disk that's going in?
[152:41.18]Well, hello!
[152:41.60]Everything going well?
[152:42.88]What will it be?
[152:44.58]Create.
[152:46.10]Which method would you use?
[152:47.00]I'm gonna use a saucer.
[152:49.84]Generate a monster from a saucer.
[152:50.90]Dream a lot about Minecraft VR thanks to the five community subs.
[152:54.51]Even more.
[152:56.17]Even more community subs.
[152:57.73]Alright, so I'm thinking either Floygan Brothers or 7th Cross Evolution.
[153:07.67]Because 7th Cross Evolution was a game about evolving monsters.
[153:16.52]Wait, Floygan?
[153:17.16]You want me to get Floygan in there?
[153:18.58]Alright, okay.
[153:19.28]Alright, alright.
[153:19.98]I'll do it.
[153:21.50]Here it is.
[153:24.24]Why is this hot?
[153:26.87]This disk is hot.
[153:27.65]It wasn't even... I don't know why.
[153:30.07]The window?
[153:30.45]Maybe, yeah.
[153:30.93]The sun is, like, shining on it.
[153:32.03]It's gonna, like, melt this thing.
[153:34.61]Alright, here you go.
[153:35.93]I always have to prove that it's actually happening, so... Here.
[153:39.30]Let me look at my hair, too.
[153:41.68]People were talking about my hair.
[153:45.28]Yeah.
[153:45.70]It is a little fucking weird, isn't it?
[153:48.16]Here you go.
[153:51.88]Plug in.
[153:53.19]For the Dreamcast.
[153:59.90]Power Stone.
[154:00.56]I'll do Power Stone.
[154:01.78]Just not right this second.
[154:06.61]Your hair looks very nice.
[154:10.75]Floygan Brothers Gonan!
[154:14.20]Give us something good.
[154:18.08]Give us like a team, a duo.
[154:25.78]What if you put in the other Monster Rancher disk?
[154:27.46]They all kind of have something crazy come out, don't they?
[154:33.67]We had more community subs from Lunch Meat!
[154:39.18]How many hundreds of community subs?
[154:41.02]The ending credits are gonna be crazy tonight.
[154:45.20]Thank you guys.
[154:51.08]Alright, here comes Floyd again, brothers.
[154:52.30]Let's see what we get.
[154:54.20]I hope it's a monster with two heads.
[154:55.84]I hope it looks like me.
[155:12.59]The count is 340.
[155:13.07]340 community subs.
[155:24.43]Thanks for waiting.
[155:25.43]Time to create a monster.
[155:28.69]Alright, does it get put in the trash, or does it come to the ranch?
[155:44.98]Just another... This is... This is a Cheeto-flavored rumor.
[155:59.09]I see it's the first time Faina's raised this monster.
[156:01.79]Let me add a page to your book.
[156:04.95]Take this monster har- alright, am I throwing- am I putting, like, the Cheeto rumor- am I throwing the Cheeto rumor away?
[156:15.70]I'm not having two rumors.
[156:26.88]destroy their brothers.
[156:28.80]It's the Floygan brothers.
[156:32.04]Trash, trash, trash, trash, garbage, garbage.
[156:34.66]I need a pole.
[156:35.30]I'm seeing too much of this.
[156:41.09]It's just Vroomer without any skin.
[156:44.43]I don't... I don't want... whatever.
[156:57.16]Alright.
[156:58.96]Trash or no?
[156:59.86]Trash it.
[157:01.91]Keep it.
[157:10.01]There you go!
[157:11.71]New pole!
[157:18.46]Ayayay.
[157:22.98]Wow, this is almost... 80%.
[157:28.96]Nobody wants this.
[157:31.40]That's unbelievable.
[157:32.24]This might be the most skewed pull I think I've ever done in here.
[157:36.10]80%.
[157:45.00]I don't think I could even let this go on.
[157:49.64]Yeah, that's it.
[157:51.08]Take this monster home now.
[157:53.74]I'm sorry.
[158:00.05]Try a different saucer stone.
[158:02.03]Sorry, Floygan.
[158:07.12]Going up next is... We're going to put in Tony Hawk 2.
[158:09.56]Let's see what we get with Tony Hawk.
[158:18.10]So you see... Let me show it off.
[158:19.93]Let me show off the disk.
[158:22.87]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
[158:24.73]There it is.
[158:25.35]In all of its glory.
[158:26.49]Original Dreamcast video game.
[158:32.13]third rumor.
[158:35.75]We'll see.
[158:40.73]Here we go.
[158:47.19]Somebody on a skateboard?
[158:53.08]Oh my goodness.
[158:55.88]Did you buy CDs just for the game?
[158:57.60]No, I have all original hardware.
[159:02.03]One of the things, one of my taglines as a streamer is like, Jerma985, what's that channel like?
[159:07.68]Well, he's an original hardware streamer.
[159:12.24]I made a name for myself.
[159:14.62]Real Dreamcast, real PlayStation 1, real hardware.
[159:17.99]I actually got Tony Hawk over here to like skateboard in front of me.
[159:25.41]Real hardware only.
[159:38.85]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast.
[159:40.41]Let's see what happens.
[159:41.59]A lot of Dreamcast games, yeah.
[159:43.12]We just did a bunch of them.
[159:48.88]Thanks for waiting.
[159:49.58]Time to create.
[160:01.35]I have, like, the gorilla's latest album here, too.
[160:13.95]What a cute monster.
[160:16.73]I see it's the first time Vayne has raised this monster.
[160:19.25]Let me add a page to your book.
[160:23.26]Are we taking the little mushroom home?
[160:32.32]It's vine soft.
[160:42.57]Alright, we'll keep it.
[160:45.91]We'll keep it.
[160:47.62]It looks like a magician.
[160:48.56]I'm gonna keep it.
[160:57.58]You're naming this monster.
[161:05.23]Name it Vinny.
[161:06.13]Ha ha ha!
[161:13.80]I don't know, I don't know if I want to name it Vinny because eventually if I freeze it and kill it, that's not, I don't know if I'm gonna like that.
[161:19.98]Alright, what if we do a, a, okay, how about... How about hash, how about hashtag V.
[161:49.09]Hashtag V is so bad.
[161:52.09]Let's just go with Shroomer.
[161:53.42]Because that's pretty good.
[161:55.52]Hashtag V is the worst name I've ever made up.
[161:58.91]Shroomer.
[162:12.63]Look after it.
[162:14.04]Try a different saucer stone.
[162:15.32]Uh, yeah.
[162:17.06]So I have two more, right?
[162:18.58]Or one more.
[162:19.08]Alright, this next one cannot end in an oomer.
[162:26.10]Alright, what am I gonna do here?
[162:29.78]Alright, here's what I'm gonna put in.
[162:32.39]I'm gonna put in... I'm gonna put in this.
[162:39.79]This game is called...
[162:43.89]For the PC, or I don't even, I couldn't get it.
[162:46.88]Yeah, Windows 95.
[162:47.70]I couldn't get this to fucking work no matter what I did.
[162:51.52]This is Jurassic Park Scan Command.
[162:58.46]It's got a, you know, T-Rex on it and everything.
[163:01.39]This, I was going to do a whole stream on this.
[163:04.77]You have like a barcode scanner and you scan it.
[163:09.21]But it is a...
[163:12.15]I couldn't... You know, it just didn't work.
[163:16.26]Scan command.
[163:18.82]Let's see what we get through scan command.
[163:21.20]For Jurassic Park.
[163:25.44]Why is your hair doing that?
[163:27.60]I don't know.
[163:28.02]I have a naturally fucked up head.
[163:30.87]I'm serious.
[163:31.63]If I shave my head and you like put your hand over it, it's like all bumpy and like rocky and shit.
[163:51.42]Opening the tray!
[163:54.15]Let's see what Jurassic Park Scan Command has in store.
[164:03.93]Oh no, that's Tony Hawk.
[164:06.24]I should put Tony Hawk back in.
[164:14.52]Alright.
[164:16.55]Bring it on.
[164:20.05]Five more community subs from JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[164:24.98]Five more.
[164:25.68]Five, five, five, five, five.
[164:27.14]Coming in every five minutes with five community subs or ten community subs.
[164:34.02]So many.
[164:34.46]Thank you.
[164:39.84]I hope it's a dinosaur.
[164:50.48]Alright, no... rumor.
[164:57.19]Okay, I kind of like it.
[165:04.69]It looks like... It looks like something that you could eat on the set of Willy Wonka.
[165:12.17]I'm keeping it.
[165:14.43]No, I'm not.
[165:18.50]I only have three slots.
[165:26.02]Too many mushrooms.
[165:26.92]Too many mushrooms.
[165:29.26]Trash it.
[165:33.57]We're too many.
[165:33.99]I'm not.
[165:34.33]Not too much.
[165:34.81]We got two mushrooms and a wheel.
[165:36.05]No.
[165:46.40]Alright, the next thing going in.
[165:48.12]Let me ask you.
[165:48.64]Okay, here's.
[165:49.22]I don't know why I have this.
[165:50.20]I don't even know if I did this before.
[165:54.41]Um, some people are going to know what this is.
[165:59.79]This is from MTV Liquid Television.
[166:05.41]This is a DVD set of the show, The Head.
[166:15.36]Does anybody remember this show?
[166:18.18]It was the Liquid Television MTV oddities.
[166:27.10]I've got all of them.
[166:28.20]I have the whole show.
[166:31.44]I... I don't know, like, why I have this.
[166:34.98]I think I bought this at, like, a convention or something.
[166:38.82]And I was like, oh, MTV!
[166:40.42]The Pornodities!
[166:41.36]And I haven't even opened this.
[166:43.13]I, like, took the skin off of it for some reason.
[166:47.77]Why?
[166:48.11]And I don't know why I brought this across the country.
[166:51.25]I donated a ton of my old games and I gave a bunch of my old stuff away, but...
[166:57.14]The head came with me, uh, for some reason.
[167:03.29]I haven't even watched it.
[167:05.51]For some reason I thought it was gonna be, like, worth money.
[167:07.23]This is dumb.
[167:10.27]I don't know.
[167:17.36]My parents didn't let me watch MTV.
[167:26.05]MTV was pretty fucked up back then.
[167:31.65]The cartoons on MTV were like Nickelodeon 4.0 with like the grossness.
[167:38.65]Puke, like farts, throw up, acid.
[167:41.60]You know what I mean?
[167:42.10]Like there was all kinds of weird shit on MTV back like in the 90s.
[167:49.95]Nickelodeon had like farts and puke and throw up and stuff, but not like that, like the Beavis and Butthead era on MTV.
[167:57.46]Alright.
[168:17.70]Wait, did I put the- I didn't put the same disk in, right?
[168:21.52]Why?
[168:22.94]I swear to god!
[168:24.60]No- I put this in!
[168:32.67]It's the same monster.
[168:34.49]Did it glitch out and save it?
[168:35.71]Alright, we're doing like- we're doing the head disk too.
[168:39.65]How do these have the same seed?
[168:43.53]Disk two of the head is- I'm not accepting that.
[169:00.56]Didn't bring his PS4, but brought the head.
[169:02.94]Alright, but a PS4 is big and bulky and has to go in a box and shit.
[169:15.45]The head is just a DVD case.
[169:26.08]Alright.
[169:28.06]Insert the Monster Rancher 4 disk.
[169:29.60]This is the head disk 2.
[169:36.00]But Jerm, what about your Bloodborne save?
[169:38.53]It's okay.
[169:40.51]Alright, give me something else that's not a shroom.
[169:59.52]He threw away his PS4?
[170:01.18]Oh no, he gave it away.
[170:02.56]He gave my PS4.
[170:03.38]Alright.
[170:28.98]That was the head, disk one, disk two, and... What was the one before it?
[170:35.48]Scan command?
[171:04.74]No, I'm not gonna name it another Oomer, I told you.
[171:16.31]I told you that's the thing on like you could eat in Willy Wonka.
[171:19.05]I'm not naming him Toomer.
[171:22.05]Or Oomer.
[171:23.05]Or like... Doomer.
[171:32.03]No, we have Boomer, Shroomer, and Wonka.
[171:38.29]Let me see the stats.
[171:41.57]Uh, how do I get a different... Oh, there we go.
[171:42.97]Okay, there's Shroomer, Vroomer, and Wonka.
[171:48.13]This company doesn't even exist anymore.
[171:51.29]They liquidated it.
[171:52.32]Look at that.
[171:53.92]That's pretty awesome, actually.
[171:55.02]Alright.
[171:56.14]Shroomer.
[171:57.66]High defense.
[171:59.16]Look at that.
[172:07.97]He's doing the PepoDance.
[172:11.81]Wonka sucks.
[172:14.25]Not really, that's a lot of- that's really high health.
[172:16.91]And the intel- the base intelligence is really good.
[172:20.03]What is that?
[172:20.59]What is- What's he got for moves?
[172:23.31]Alright, we've got pecking.
[172:29.55]Slap.
[172:32.06]Accuracy rate is pretty- this is the one right here.
[172:35.26]Pollen.
[172:36.12]This is a poison.
[172:38.58]So unfortunately, this is a dot.
[172:40.80]It's the only move that does any damage.
[172:45.67]And even so, it doesn't do very much damage.
[172:47.95]It's a D for damage.
[172:49.05]This is A for accuracy.
[172:50.41]Yeah, he's terrible.
[172:52.71]Ice him.
[172:57.17]Shroomer is alright.
[173:05.41]High defense.
[173:07.39]High base defense.
[173:08.25]Let's see what you got for moves.
[173:09.11]Let's see if these, you know, you have the... So it's all about intelligence.
[173:14.87]And power a little bit.
[173:15.67]Let's see.
[173:17.17]This is Pokorin.
[173:19.55]It's a short-range move.
[173:21.27]And then... Aim hit.
[173:26.29]Accuracy is an A. Life damage is an E. D...
[173:36.06]Terrible.
[173:37.46]The accuracy's alright.
[173:39.74]But look at that life to E for life damage.
[173:46.47]We'll work on Shroomer.
[173:47.55]I feel like Shroomer will be okay later.
[173:49.23]That's lightning.
[173:52.95]Element statuses.
[173:56.64]Soft body.
[173:57.80]Softens damage from punch or stab attacks.
[174:02.73]And is spoiled rotten already.
[174:05.61]Doesn't like to fight.
[174:08.58]Is already spoiled.
[174:10.00]Doesn't like to fight.
[174:13.24]You are really on thin ice, and I really mean that literally, because you're gonna get fucking frozen in about ten seconds.
[174:24.73]I hate this thing.
[174:25.99]Um...
[174:32.78]I think it might be, I think we've got to freeze.
[174:34.76]Both of them.
[174:36.30]Alright, uh, how do I... What is it?
[174:44.50]It's not a phrase.
[174:45.48]No, how do I do it?
[174:52.51]Association?
[174:55.13]Fuse and, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them, I'll fuse them.
[175:04.84]Wonka and Shroomer are going to get fused.
[175:08.40]Don't you need a certain item?
[175:12.40]Alright, retire.
[175:14.52]Or can I combine them right now?
[175:15.70]Alright, they have to be frozen.
[175:21.54]Look at Maus's power!
[175:22.56]200 base power?
[175:24.00]Why did we throw that one in the trash?
[175:29.28]Alright, retire.
[175:30.76]Shroomer.
[175:35.57]Freeze Shroomer.
[175:39.21]Sorry, but... that's the end of you.
[175:43.63]Nah!
[175:46.67]Uh, retire.
[175:50.19]Wonka.
[175:53.68]This feels unfair, because Roomer's stats are terrible in comparison to all... whatever.
[176:09.78]Now, combine... Let's combine, and we got Shroomer... Combine... Okay, Shroomer and... What is... They already... Is that what they were combined with, kind of, in the first place?
[176:31.91]Shroomer and Wonka.
[176:34.37]Or Maus and Shroomer.
[176:38.35]We're gonna get like a Troomer dog.
[176:45.61]Not even a day old.
[176:49.85]Not even one day old.
[176:52.45]Both of them.
[176:54.85]Troomer.
[176:59.03]And Wonka.
[177:01.96]Does it cost any money?
[177:06.88]Petrin or Mushtan?
[177:13.51]Unless you actually select it now.
[177:15.23]195... 145... What the fuck?
[177:37.85]What on Earth just happened?
[177:43.11]An anonymous gifter has just given a hundred community subs.
[177:48.90]Anonymous gifter.
[177:50.46]I don't know who you are, but that's a lot.
[177:54.74]That's a lot.
[178:00.09]Whoever you are, thank you for the hundred subs.
[178:10.89]Jesus.
[178:19.03]That's insane.
[178:19.81]Thank you.
[178:20.63]Whoever you are.
[178:21.17]Uh, I feel like both of these are terrible.
[178:29.48]Let me try... That was a... I did... That was fucking crazy.
[178:34.52]Thank you.
[178:35.92]What about Maus and Shroomer?
[178:39.62]Kairotopi 5 community subs.
[178:48.38]Oh my god.
[178:49.12]Oh, that one sucks too.
[178:56.73]Yeah, the subs are still rolling in.
[179:02.19]My god.
[179:03.93]What about Maus and Wonka?
[179:13.50]No, we're gonna get, like, mush tan.
[179:15.14]195 health is kind of good, though.
[179:24.39]Magic, lore, and pheromone.
[179:27.81]Skills, pecking, slap, and pollen.
[179:29.65]Same thing as the other one.
[179:30.53]This character's terrible.
[179:36.57]It's just another dumb, shitty mushroom.
[179:39.73]Let's go and put some more CDs in.
[179:49.42]Troomer has good magic potential.
[179:51.35]To be combined, yeah.
[180:00.64]Alright, the next few... We've got to win some competitions here.
[180:05.96]I'm gonna go with... We'll put in... I have humans here.
[180:09.62]Oops.
[180:10.94]What is this?
[180:11.62]Something just fell out of this.
[180:12.87]What CD is this?
[180:13.51]Whatever it is.
[180:13.93]Alright, this is the thing that's going in next.
[180:16.95]I don't even care.
[180:18.47]The next thing going in is MLB Show 17.
[180:20.49]Okay.
[180:37.98]Boomer sports.
[180:39.15]Baseball is not a boomer sport.
[180:43.73]Really?
[180:44.77]Baseball is boomer sport?
[180:50.24]Baseball has been around for a fucking hundred plus years.
[180:58.28]They were playing baseball back when cavemen were throwing rocks at each other.
[181:04.57]What do you mean exactly?
[181:05.71]A baby boomer is... a baby boomer is like... not from like 1880.
[181:10.07]Do you guys think that they're still alive?
[181:14.05]Yeah, no, fuck those boomers that were, you know, born in 1872.
[181:26.52]Boomers are just old people.
[181:32.16]A baby boomer didn't invent baseball.
[181:42.25]They did.
[181:42.67]No, they didn't.
[181:44.65]What's after the boomers?
[181:47.25]The pilgrims, I think, right?
[181:50.00]I don't know.
[181:51.12]What was that?
[181:52.02]Boomer was like the 30s and the 40s, right?
[181:55.12]What was before boomer?
[181:56.24]Pilgrim?
[182:06.79]Super boomers.
[182:19.22]Nobody existed before Boomers.
[182:25.62]What the fuck is this?
[182:27.20]Why do I keep getting this?
[182:28.64]I don't want- Something's wrong with my game.
[182:35.38]Something's wrong with my game.
[182:38.34]I don't know what's going on.
[182:41.67]I have to- I'm gonna turn the game off.
[182:43.61]And turn it back on.
[182:44.31]Wait, I have to save it!
[182:45.13]Don't do that yet.
[182:50.23]Alright.
[182:50.55]Insert a CD or DVD.
[182:53.51]If this is the same thing, then come on.
[182:55.13]Something's fucked up here.
[182:59.17]Alright.
[182:59.77]Here it is.
[183:00.63]His gorilla's humans.
[183:08.43]ESP root 5 community subs.
[183:10.07]Thank you, ESP root.
[183:18.56]Subs all over the place tonight.
[183:20.42]Everywhere.
[183:22.72]If this is a shroom, I'm going to reset the game.
[183:24.77]I'm going to save it and restart.
[183:25.73]Maybe it's because these DVDs are too new?
[183:31.13]I mean, was Dreamcast... Dreamcast was... They were CDs, right?
[183:37.72]Not DVDs.
[183:38.80]Dreamcast wasn't DVD-ROM, was it?
[183:53.24]Alright, let's see if we get the same thing.
[183:55.90]If it is a shroom, then I'm gonna save, reset, and then we might... Somebody said we have to play, I think.
[184:01.12]More than 60% of the monsters are held behind A rank, as always.
[184:05.28]Well, that sucks.
[184:07.20]I have to get to A rank.
[184:08.06]Just get to A rank.
[184:09.04]That's all we have to do.
[184:16.08]Okay.
[184:17.50]No shroom.
[184:19.72]No mushroom.
[184:20.72]Something else.
[184:35.39]It's clam.
[184:36.81]This thing is so cool.
[184:38.49]It's a walnut fucking... Oh, it's a walnut.
[184:43.36]It's like the inside of a walnut.
[184:51.62]First time fan has raised this monster.
[184:53.27]Let me add page to your book.
[184:55.15]Yes, I'm taking it.
[185:00.17]Wall-E?
[185:11.48]A bell?
[185:11.90]No, that's a walnut.
[185:12.96]Wally.
[185:13.44]I like, I like Wally.
[185:15.89]Nut, nut.
[185:16.47]Nut, nut man.
[185:17.35]Why would, nut man.
[185:20.87]Wally.
[185:39.68]It's not Nut Man, it's Wall-E.
[185:43.15]Okay, look, you can call him Nut Man if you want.
[185:51.03]It's not, it's a Wall- Wall-E!
[185:53.67]Wall-E!
[185:55.62]Wall-E the walnut.
[186:03.48]Walnut Wahlberg.
[186:10.91]Let's get another one.
[186:11.87]Alright, so our game is not broken, we just got unlucky.
[186:16.36]Let's go with one more.
[186:17.24]Uh oh.
[186:28.57]Oh shit, this is just the Monster Rancher 4 disk.
[186:34.62]It didn't get- I pressed the button too early.
[186:42.43]Uh, no.
[186:44.05]Okay.
[186:46.81]Hey, at least they knew.
[186:51.89]So what's going on now?
[186:52.81]What do I got right here?
[186:54.47]I could put a Mr. Mosquito.
[186:56.57]PlayStation 2.
[186:57.21]Urban Chaos PlayStation.
[186:58.23]Let's do Mr. Mosquito.
[186:59.53]Maybe we'll get a Mosquito Monster.
[187:11.09]Please stop playing this game.
[187:12.63]What are you talking about?
[187:14.75]This game is so much fun.
[187:16.73]It's so much fun just to, like, just hang out and make fucking monsters from discs.
[187:25.58]Alright, Mr. Mosquito going in.
[187:30.64]Put in Monster Rancher 3.
[187:31.68]I don't own it anymore.
[187:32.54]That's one of the things I didn't bring.
[187:35.28]Because I hated that game.
[187:36.44]I thought it was terrible.
[187:38.52]This is...
[187:40.57]A little different, but it's still... I'm getting enjoyment from it.
[187:43.83]I didn't like 3 at all.
[187:47.01]3 was weird.
[187:47.70]3 did this thing where you had to, like, walk around and do... Select, like, shiny things on the ground to train.
[187:54.42]I didn't like it.
[188:04.68]This reminds me more of 2 than 3 does of 2.
[188:09.24]What?
[188:09.72]Whatever.
[188:14.47]So this is Mr. Mosquito.
[188:24.14]I think a bug just came out of that.
[188:25.30]No.
[188:28.08]Just packing peanut.
[188:33.92]You didn't show us.
[188:34.66]Oh, fuck.
[188:35.08]Oh, well.
[188:36.58]Could have been anything.
[188:37.14]I could be lying to you right now.
[188:41.37]I could be just making that whole thing up.
[188:43.77]Here, look, I'll show you the disk.
[188:45.31]I'll show you, just so you know.
[188:48.33]This thing was expensive too, guys.
[188:54.34]This was no... I gotta be careful with this one.
[188:57.12]This was expensive.
[189:00.64]Mr. Mosquito from Eidos Interactive.
[189:05.27]This was fucking...
[189:14.87]It was like 40 bucks.
[189:19.90]Let's go!
[189:29.90]Break it in half.
[189:30.82]Okay fine, sure dude.
[189:34.69]Fuck!
[189:38.47]Alright, yeah, excuse me.
[189:40.07]I'll take the fucking bear swordsman.
[189:42.89]Holy shit.
[189:45.61]I'll take the Power Ranger.
[189:46.59]Yep.
[189:53.53]Robo Bear Swordsman.
[190:07.84]That's Phoebe...
[190:13.21]This thing's cool.
[190:14.18]I'm gonna... Forget about the other two characters.
[190:15.80]I don't care.
[190:17.46]RoboBBS.
[190:20.72]RoboBoomer.
[190:21.76]No.
[190:22.36]It's not gonna be RoboBoomer.
[190:23.56]Uh, how about... RoboBoomer.
[190:29.45]Ugh, this is tough.
[190:32.31]Slash.
[190:32.63]No.
[190:32.97]Uh...
[190:45.63]Beanbag Boomer.
[190:51.05]Oh, that's a really good one.
[190:52.29]I'll use that one.
[190:52.93]That's a good one.
[190:53.43]Dick Fart.
[190:54.09]Yeah, sure.
[190:57.54]That's a really good one.
[190:58.24]I'll do it.
[191:06.44]Is this a Dark Souls character?
[191:07.92]Oh, you're getting invaded by... Oh, what's his name?
[191:12.36]It's a bunch of asterisks.
[191:14.65]Who's this?
[191:15.55]Invaded by Dickfart22222222223.
[191:17.33]Uh... What's a... Okay, what's like a thrust or... The Hibernator.
[191:34.32]Hibernator.
[191:35.60]That's kind of good.
[191:36.12]That's a little bit of a robo theme and a bear.
[191:39.52]Hibernator.
[191:40.79]What?
[191:40.95]No, it is a bear.
[191:41.55]Bears hibernate.
[191:42.17]Why would I have to have bear in there?
[191:46.56]Hyperdator hyper babe hyper baiter Master Hyper hyper beater
[192:19.64]Peter, why would I do that?
[192:21.56]You guys usually are pretty good.
[192:23.40]I can't fit that.
[192:25.54]I can only have like seven letters, guys.
[192:53.22]I gotta get out of here!
[192:54.30]Rawbear?
[193:18.52]Robert?
[193:19.04]Roberto?
[193:20.45]None.
[193:22.61]Roberto.
[193:23.45]This is the other things are awesome.
[193:51.08]What would it be?
[193:51.94]Back to the ranch.
[193:52.52]Let's see.
[193:54.32]This is going to probably have such ridiculous stats.
[194:05.53]So we've got Wally, Vroomer, and Roberto.
[194:11.11]That's actually not terrible base stats.
[194:20.05]High defense.
[194:21.35]Decent power.
[194:22.03]It's all about power.
[194:27.55]Okay, what do you got?
[194:28.15]You got kick and charge.
[194:32.07]Where's slash?
[194:33.41]You have a sword in your hand.
[194:39.17]Um, hold on a second.
[194:40.17]But guys, this is life damage B. That's a lot of damage.
[194:51.69]What's that?
[194:51.99]What is it?
[194:52.81]22 guts?
[194:53.07]That's not very much at all.
[194:54.65]This thing actually could be pretty good.
[194:55.65]Alright, what about your stats?
[194:59.10]Your, uh... Golden foot.
[195:02.90]Increases the power of moves that use the feet.
[195:06.83]But you have a sword in your hand.
[195:09.83]You've got a golden foot.
[195:13.51]That doesn't make any sense.
[195:16.96]Alright, Wall-E, what about you?
[195:18.64]Holy shit, look at that defense.
[195:21.20]That's the best.
[195:22.08]Pure walnut defense.
[195:26.70]And pretty high intelligence, too.
[195:27.70]This is probably the best character.
[195:28.82]Look at the base defense.
[195:32.16]Alright, we got some moves here.
[195:33.26]We got... Life Damage C. That's not terrible.
[195:37.65]Pretty bad accuracy rate, though.
[195:38.89]What about this one?
[195:39.99]This is called... Cracker.
[195:44.21]Not bad.
[195:46.20]It adds addled, whatever that means.
[195:50.08]Not bad.
[195:51.42]What about you?
[195:54.77]Hard shell.
[195:55.47]Reduces damage, but harder to dodge attacks.
[195:58.77]Okay.
[196:00.31]And what's that element?
[196:02.67]I don't know what element is.
[196:03.67]Is it a teal?
[196:06.37]I don't know what that is.
[196:11.45]It's a wolf with a katana, and you didn't name him Sekiro.
[196:14.33]As a bearer.
[196:20.68]Maybe it is a wolf.
[196:23.43]So it is a wolf.
[196:25.15]But it's okay.
[196:26.05]Just pretend it's a bear.
[196:26.99]That's a bear.
[196:32.57]Alright, so how do I... This is gonna be interesting.
[196:34.67]Oh, fuck.
[196:37.04]So.
[196:38.44]Is this for... Everybody has their own schedule.
[196:42.22]Oh, dear.
[196:42.78]This is gonna be... This is micromanagement of the video game.
[196:47.74]So, let's see.
[196:49.80]Let's do... More defense?
[196:55.94]What do you need?
[197:01.38]You need... Your highest stat is defense and intelligence.
[197:07.95]Your moves... The best move that you have...
[197:14.95]is a power move, but you have higher intelligence, so this will probably do more damage.
[197:20.15]So I'm going to say increase intelligence.
[197:22.55]Intelligence and defense.
[197:24.25]Intelligence, defense, and life.
[197:25.95]We'll start with here.
[197:26.61]Give you a good schedule here.
[197:50.15]Three in a row.
[197:50.85]Okay, that looks alright.
[197:55.07]Maybe one more here.
[197:57.67]One more in life.
[198:02.85]Got two days of rest.
[198:04.21]What about you?
[198:06.45]So you have, what's his moves?
[198:11.90]He's kind of all over the place.
[198:14.65]power does he have any intelligence move no it's all about power so power power accuracy in life I would say or speed I'm gonna do power life and speed because he's already got put that defense is already high enough for now power life speed so
[198:45.44]Is it okay to clear the schedules to other monsters using this gadget?
[198:49.18]Oh, shit.
[198:51.54]Okay, they can't do it at the same time.
[198:53.54]Oh, fuck.
[198:54.60]Okay, so it's trampoline.
[199:10.12]What is it?
[199:10.94]Power, life, and speed?
[199:12.02]Oh, you can do the high jump.
[199:13.42]You can do trampoline on this day.
[199:15.64]Rest.
[199:16.22]Let's give you some life.
[199:19.55]And we'll do power again.
[199:25.63]Rest.
[199:28.27]And... Trampoline again.
[199:30.99]Oh, you motherfucker.
[199:33.17]Who is doing it to this day?
[199:37.41]You are.
[199:37.81]You're using the speed.
[199:40.01]You're doing fine.
[199:42.86]What day are you not doing this?
[199:43.92]I'm going to switch these dates here.
[199:49.40]Trampoline.
[199:50.18]Target.
[199:51.38]Okay, now you can do... Trampoline.
[199:55.71]There we go.
[199:57.45]I think we're ready.
[200:11.82]Go for it.
[200:18.66]So we had Rumor's Resting, Wall-E plus six, Roberto plus six.
[200:27.94]Let's go take a look at what they're doing.
[200:29.58]So we're just making a carnival of monsters.
[200:33.24]Good training.
[200:33.86]You're doing great.
[200:41.56]I don't even remember what the training was for this.
[200:46.36]Where's Roberto?
[200:52.13]Did he just take- He just took his arm off.
[200:58.65]I think they're dumb.
[201:01.11]Oh no.
[201:05.52]Yay!
[201:06.12]I'm having so much fun.
[201:09.88]Scold.
[201:12.10]No, I can't do that.
[201:12.80]You're too cute.
[201:20.15]I think this is going to be our very special boy.
[201:24.25]The other two, who cares?
[201:25.21]Well, actually, everybody loves the Beanie Baby.
[201:30.97]I think this guy sucks.
[201:34.52]Yeah, I may as well just throw you into the freezer right now.
[201:38.58]But we'll just see what happens.
[201:41.46]I can only do one command, right?
[201:42.92]Can I do anything else today?
[201:43.92]Holy shit, I thought it was going to hurt me.
[201:49.03]I can do one command per... You are so cool, but so dumb at the same time.
[201:57.25]How are you doing?
[201:57.71]You doing okay?
[201:59.97]Here, have some beer.
[202:01.37]No, we're going to take him into tournaments.
[202:09.91]Give him a chance, you know?
[202:11.73]Alright.
[202:12.55]Not hungry, not hungry, not hungry.
[202:18.50]Weekend activities.
[202:28.34]I get three actions per week now.
[202:29.48]That's actually pretty good.
[202:30.12]Uh-oh.
[202:32.98]Fane, wake up!
[202:33.75]Something's happened!
[202:36.93]Oh, morning reel.
[202:37.79]What is it?
[202:38.43]Somebody die.
[202:38.87]Okay.
[202:40.89]Oh, um, change your, change those pants.
[202:45.41]I don't even know what that's implying.
[202:46.81]Oh, sorry, just a second, I'll put something on.
[202:50.47]Did I go to the bathroom in my pants?
[202:53.84]Was I wearing pants?
[202:55.70]This one, this one found this this morning.
[203:00.38]Was this giant cave here before?
[203:03.12]No, I've never seen it before.
[203:08.45]And I feel some strange power.
[203:09.87]It seems like it's beckoning us.
[203:14.15]Beckoning us?
[203:14.79]How cool.
[203:15.43]Let's take the monsters and investigate.
[203:19.21]What are cave doing here?
[203:20.63]I'll have to investigate.
[203:21.93]Huh?
[203:25.39]Um, excuse me, but who are you?
[203:28.17]Me?
[203:28.73]I'm in charge of the investigation of these parts.
[203:30.99]Call me Mr. K. And how about you kids?
[203:34.95]Are you in charge of an investigation of this cave too?
[203:39.03]Yes, that's why we're here.
[203:41.59]Well, that's just splendid.
[203:43.79]But, you know, I'm a bit worried for you.
[203:45.69]There's monsters inside.
[203:49.51]I have an idea.
[203:50.51]Let the adventurer, Mr. K, tell you the ins and outs of exploring.
[203:53.94]Is it going to be a tutorial?
[203:56.84]Fuck the voice.
[203:57.68]Finish all your preparations by the weekend.
[204:00.26]Then meet me in front of the cave this weekend.
[204:02.34]Until then... Ta-ta, he's gone.
[204:05.12]What a strange old man.
[204:07.73]He seems like a nice guy, and it might be fun to go exploring this weekend.
[204:11.97]Cool.
[204:15.37]So this weekend, go exploring.
[204:16.99]Who do I want to bring?
[204:17.63]Can I bring everybody?
[204:21.20]Everybody's on their schedule.
[204:27.02]Speed.
[204:27.92]Whoa.
[204:29.94]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[204:32.14]Vroomer plus 16 speed.
[204:33.80]Wall-E, 6 defense, 8 power for Ruberto.
[204:36.09]That was a lot.
[204:38.49]That was like a critical hit.
[204:39.71]Wow.
[204:39.91]Good job.
[204:42.19]Okay, how are you doing over here?
[204:53.00]Okay, okay.
[204:53.34]He's kind of hungry.
[204:54.02]What do robots eat?
[205:09.13]That was actually pretty cool.
[205:10.21]That was awesome.
[205:12.37]Yeah.
[205:13.39]You get to stick around.
[205:14.11]That was awesome.
[205:16.40]What about you?
[205:16.84]Are you hungry?
[205:19.28]Not yet.
[205:23.06]Continue your training.
[205:24.04]Alright, let's see the weekend activity.
[205:32.75]Well, the weekend is here and I assume you're fully prepared.
[205:36.38]Well then, we're off.
[205:37.36]Mr. K, the adventurer, will be your guide on this fabulous expedition.
[205:42.84]So this is... Adventure.
[205:45.14]Take monster being raised exploring.
[205:49.86]Um... The toggle caves.
[205:51.94]A mysterious cave found behind the ranch one day.
[205:55.94]Select monsters to explore with.
[206:00.11]Um...
[206:03.50]Wally?
[206:04.20]Who should go?
[206:04.78]Fulness?
[206:05.54]Who's like the... Okay.
[206:08.30]Roberto is the least... Or maybe Vroomer.
[206:19.25]Yeah.
[206:24.16]Or if it's dangerous.
[206:29.16]High defense, maybe?
[206:32.62]Let's throw Wally in there.
[206:35.14]We can take everybody.
[206:35.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[206:38.68]What the hell is this?
[206:40.52]This is turning into an iPad game.
[206:41.56]713 energy.
[206:41.74]Okay, I guess.
[206:42.10]Let's go.
[207:01.87]Go exploring with these monsters, yeah.
[207:14.14]First floor of the Toggle Caves.
[207:18.36]Let's start with the basics.
[207:19.46]Left analog stick move.
[207:21.64]You can move the camera with the right analog stick.
[207:24.31]First try going to the treasure chest ahead of you.
[207:35.95]What the hell?
[207:38.55]When in front of the chest, push X to open it.
[207:44.88]This is a different game.
[207:47.54]What is it?
[207:47.90]Received yarn ball.
[207:49.96]Well, this yarn ball is yours now.
[207:51.25]Keep it safe.
[207:52.73]Sometimes chests are hidden when you get near a suspicious location.
[207:56.05]The cursor appears.
[208:02.48]Suspicious location.
[208:03.24]Is he gonna have to explore around?
[208:04.54]I'm running out of time.
[208:07.68]The top left is, I think, their total health pool or something.
[208:18.49]That's how much energy they have.
[208:19.51]Go close to a suspicious spot and look for the cursor.
[208:36.14]This is not a suspicious spot.
[208:42.50]Alright, I barely got a mouse hole over here.
[208:47.90]That's it!
[208:48.26]Now push the X right there!
[208:49.70]Except you don't have a monster to search it right now.
[208:52.32]How?
[208:54.48]Let's move on.
[208:54.98]We'll search for stray monsters.
[208:56.09]What are we talking about?
[209:01.19]Can I select a different monster?
[209:04.87]What, you can't fit in there or something?
[209:06.03]I don't get it.
[209:06.43]Command.
[209:08.69]Sword.
[209:09.23]This is too big.
[209:15.76]What about the walnut?
[209:18.98]Whatever, apparently I can't do it again anyways.
[209:27.40]There were stray monsters.
[209:28.94]Well... I think I just ran into them.
[209:35.83]Random encounters?
[209:36.88]Uh... Alright, it's one of the flowers.
[209:44.76]Here's the question, so I have to... Is this like a... Is this like Marvel vs. Capcom?
[209:56.97]Can I pull in other people?
[210:05.60]It's kill or be killed.
[210:07.14]Okay, experience plus 13.
[210:12.41]Level 1.
[210:17.57]Interesting.
[210:18.83]Win battles to raise experience points.
[210:20.63]As you level up, new skills, traits, and items can be obtained.
[210:27.74]This is how you get new moves.
[210:32.86]If you lose a battle, your experience, skills, and items remain, but you are returned to your ranch fatigued.
[210:39.42]Using Quit Exploring on the circle button is the same.
[210:45.27]When you quit exploring, your monster becomes exhausted, and its lifespan is shortened.
[210:51.69]What?
[210:52.71]You mean it won't live as long?
[210:54.71]Nope!
[210:55.19]It's a cruel world!
[210:59.20]What an explanation.
[211:00.24]See the gauge on the lower left of the screen?
[211:02.06]That's the energy gauge, and it lowers over time.
[211:07.27]It's essential to exploration.
[211:09.35]It lowers each time you move, and when it reaches zero, your monster's life lowers.
[211:13.95]Watch it carefully.
[211:16.13]Does energy ever rise?
[211:18.08]No, it does not rise.
[211:20.38]But while you have energy, the life of the monsters that took damage during battle will gradually recover.
[211:26.27]Um...
[211:55.07]I kind of don't want to do this.
[211:59.65]I'm gonna drain their life essence forever.
[212:04.93]Something... bats?
[212:09.48]What about chests?
[212:15.70]Nothing?
[212:19.58]Nothing to investigate?
[212:21.98]Nothing to look at?
[212:28.95]I still have plenty of energy.
[212:32.86]Oh.
[212:38.02]This is cool.
[212:45.03]Alright, so we get a Mogie E. R2... just flips between... Okay, L1 brings out another monster.
[212:57.02]Alright, we'll see here.
[212:57.60]What do we got?
[212:58.88]Timidity.
[212:59.40]Alright, I don't want you to lose health, because you're my favorite.
[213:06.97]What about the other move?
[213:07.63]Let's see it.
[213:12.15]Team up!
[213:15.06]What does that mean?
[213:16.56]Dodge.
[213:17.46]Dodge again.
[213:18.42]Nice.
[213:23.88]I want to do the other move, but I can't.
[213:25.22]Let's bring in, uh, Beartoe.
[213:29.84]He's a little timid.
[213:32.48]Kicks do more damage, right?
[213:37.61]Beartoe, you kind of... There we go.
[213:48.17]Nobody did damage.
[213:53.74]Fucking decimated.
[214:03.44]Cool.
[214:04.26]654.
[214:06.60]Two paths we can go down here.
[214:07.88]Let's check the one on the left.
[214:13.11]Okay, I kind of want a smaller monster out here.
[214:16.09]To take up almost the whole screen.
[214:20.15]Chest.
[214:27.68]Obtained Junk Toy.
[214:30.68]How are you that big?
[214:38.38]Okay, well I got a toy.
[214:41.52]That's a pretty corpse.
[214:58.98]Oh dear.
[215:01.90]Geeklon E. That's a cool looking monster.
[215:08.80]It's like a giant beetle.
[215:16.53]E for easy, yeah.
[215:18.21]They do have different ranks.
[215:23.83]Obtained Rose Perfume.
[215:30.03]You skipped the dance.
[215:33.25]We've seen the dance a million times.
[215:36.03]We'd have to see it every single time.
[215:42.26]Chest, good.
[215:45.04]I definitely like this more than the last one.
[215:46.62]Because this same idea was in Monster Rancher 3.
[215:51.34]But this feels more fun to do than the other one.
[215:53.54]Anything in this corner?
[215:55.91]Nope.
[216:01.41]Don't ever skip.
[216:04.59]I still have 600 points.
[216:05.19]I have to try to get out of here.
[216:07.97]That was like a little tutorial.
[216:08.99]I don't want to, like, drain them.
[216:11.43]Stay here.
[216:11.97]Forward.
[216:13.05]Or ranch.
[216:16.80]Let's go.
[216:22.36]Second floor.
[216:26.52]Alright, we have to see the other command here.
[216:27.74]We have to see how the other run...
[216:30.66]How do you run, Roberto?
[216:36.09]You all have a really loud, annoying sound.
[216:39.47]But that's okay.
[216:42.37]What is this?
[216:42.99]Can I touch this?
[216:46.01]Ooh, what is it?
[216:47.65]Roberto can't help you to investigate.
[216:50.77]I know who might.
[216:55.07]Not Wally.
[216:55.57]Can the rumor jump up there?
[216:57.65]Like, bounce up there?
[217:00.98]Rumor can't help you investigate.
[217:09.02]Wally can't help you investigate.
[217:14.08]Why?
[217:14.32]Why are you all so stupid?
[217:16.58]Whatever.
[217:16.82]Let's go this way.
[217:22.30]Maybe they have to be able to fly to get up there?
[217:42.62]Chest!
[217:46.23]Playing cards!
[217:49.45]Uh, that's cool.
[217:50.45]Nobody can fit in here.
[217:51.87]Right?
[217:52.83]Can you fit in there?
[217:53.30]Are you big enough?
[217:54.44]Wally can't help you.
[218:00.86]I got Yu-Gi-Oh battle cards.
[218:11.10]Aunt Koro E. It's very, like, slug... What are they?
[218:19.22]I think these are Sesame Street characters.
[218:21.79]Bring a... I want to do this move.
[218:27.79]That's a cool move.
[218:30.67]It's like a party blaster.
[218:35.39]Stop being so timid!
[218:36.30]Stop!
[218:38.44]That's Digthorns.
[218:40.89]Alright, you be in turn.
[218:41.85]Bring in the Drift.
[218:46.35]It's one of those little party poppers that you buy at the gas station.
[218:57.40]Vroom are almost level two.
[219:03.66]Isabel Sidesmash?
[219:07.13]Is that what Isabel does?
[219:08.01]This is a green chest.
[219:15.35]Obtained a life tablet.
[219:20.61]What's this?
[219:21.09]Something strange is inside.
[219:22.31]A stone tablet.
[219:23.19]It seems very old.
[219:25.25]The writing seems to explain something.
[219:26.98]Almost like a blueprint.
[219:29.12]You're right.
[219:29.46]That's really interesting.
[219:31.46]But why do I have the feeling that I've seen this before?
[219:34.80]Really?
[219:35.12]Uh.
[219:38.52]I suppose it's nothing.
[219:40.32]Anyway, we found something really neat.
[219:42.32]This is enough exploring for now.
[219:44.38]Alright.
[219:48.49]So the life tablet, I'm gonna assume when you combine it, you can add it and add extra life, or you can just consume it and put... He left before I did.
[220:07.91]Rio is just baked.
[220:13.38]Hello, I invited myself in.
[220:15.26]Guess you were out and about.
[220:16.16]Yeah, I guess you could say that.
[220:19.46]Oh, what's that stone you have there?
[220:20.82]Let me have a look.
[220:22.70]This, I found it in the cave.
[220:23.92]Do you know anything about it?
[220:26.35]This design, these joints, looks like a blueprint for a training gadget.
[220:31.37]Wait a minute, does that mean that people from ages past used training gadgets too?
[220:36.53]If that's the case, then this is a real discovery.
[220:39.69]What?
[220:41.19]Could I ask you a favor, Fain?
[220:43.19]Could I borrow this from you?
[220:45.55]I want to try recreating the ancient training gadget described in these blueprints.
[220:50.63]Sure, go right ahead.
[220:51.59]Oh, I'll go exploring again and look for more.
[220:54.57]Oh, actually, I'll give you the training gadget as soon as it's done.
[220:58.80]A chance to recreate a training gadget with my very own hands.
[221:03.24]Oh, it's just amazing.
[221:05.42]I've got to get started right away by then.
[221:07.37]The public looks so happy.
[221:11.21]We've got to go exploring again.
[221:19.15]How's everybody doing?
[221:19.71]Okay, we've got more training sessions.
[221:24.03]You're a little tired, but, you know.
[221:25.67]Is anybody scheduled to sleep right now?
[221:30.75]Week one.
[221:32.65]Exercise.
[221:33.17]Rest.
[221:35.85]And trampoline.
[221:36.43]Okay.
[221:37.01]Let's get to it.
[221:46.05]Rumor's been on point with the training recently.
[221:48.63]Roberto.
[221:49.45]I'm going to have to scold you.
[221:51.55]I mean, you didn't even try.
[222:00.68]You just didn't even try.
[222:01.50]Sorry.
[222:11.57]He could have killed you.
[222:14.65]You did really good, though.
[222:20.95]He thought about it.
[222:24.12]In your sleep.
[222:24.72]Good.
[222:24.92]Uh, anybody hungry?
[222:30.56]Not really.
[222:31.00]Everything's alright.
[222:32.86]Are you hungry?
[222:34.54]No.
[222:41.11]So you can go on an adventure.
[222:42.37]I can do this whenever I want.
[222:43.75]That's cool.
[222:45.90]Do I have to find a new place?
[222:47.54]Probably have to find a new place to do it, right?
[222:52.68]I like the snow.
[223:01.37]It's nice.
[223:03.09]What have we got on schedule now?
[223:04.23]We've got...
[223:06.90]Exercise power, balance, and you are going to rest.
[223:12.98]Yeah, you're frustrated, might as well just rest.
[223:20.39]Holy shit.
[223:22.75]Uh, it's time to do some tournaments here.
[223:24.89]Look at these stats.
[223:31.42]205, 142...
[223:37.28]1.49.
[223:37.38]I think it's time.
[223:43.42]Let's get some tournaments going here.
[223:47.48]Here, have a mango.
[223:51.27]Did you like it?
[223:53.11]Alright, I don't want to be weird here, but... What is on the stomach?
[224:03.01]What is that?
[224:13.91]It's an ear.
[224:17.97]Uh, not yet, hold on.
[224:18.71]You're not hungry.
[224:20.45]You are very hungry and very tired.
[224:22.86]Eat a potato.
[224:31.98]Happy?
[224:32.36]Good.
[224:33.21]Alright, now you, on the other hand.
[224:36.05]You're doing alright, you're just resting.
[224:42.40]God, I can't wait to see you.
[224:45.25]In some, like, fanfiction OC somewhere.
[224:51.61]Sorry, I meant to say every fanfiction OC.
[224:55.86]Alright, I have to correct myself here.
[224:59.66]Alright, I think we can go.
[225:00.96]Let me open up the schedule to see...
[225:10.16]Alright.
[225:10.94]Next week, let's plan out some competitions for the three of them.
[225:16.27]Calendar.
[225:18.53]So, Rumor is able to join this one.
[225:21.39]This is just a snow cup.
[225:23.69]Fifteen hundred bucks.
[225:25.75]Let's sign you up for this one.
[225:26.81]Get you in tip-top shape for it.
[225:30.19]And then down here... Can I... Can they fight each other?
[225:40.63]Can only one?
[225:41.71]Okay, Wally will do this one.
[225:42.97]So that's next week.
[225:45.39]And then... Roberto... Kind of can't do much.
[225:53.87]This has already been going on here.
[225:57.35]No, okay.
[226:01.24]He'll do the first one on this week, Roberto.
[226:03.82]Another competition?
[226:04.64]Oh no, that's the same one.
[226:06.12]This is January, so February he'll do this one.
[226:13.40]Alright.
[226:16.19]This bed is so comfy right now.
[226:18.01]Fuck.
[226:18.69]I'm glad you're having a good comfy rest.
[226:23.13]You... Speaking of rest... Let me take a look at the schedule here.
[226:28.75]Tomorrow, Wally has a tournament.
[226:33.52]How are you doing, Wally?
[226:34.14]You're doing fine.
[226:34.76]Wally can do whatever he wants to do here.
[226:37.54]Meditation.
[226:39.56]And then Vroomer has...
[226:42.62]Vrooma, you need to rest.
[226:45.22]Because you're very tired.
[226:48.10]And you can do the trampoline tomorrow.
[226:49.52]So, rest.
[226:50.42]And then you, it doesn't really matter.
[226:54.93]Alright, let's do it.
[226:59.61]Vrooma looks really... Yeah, Vrooma's going to rest today.
[227:11.97]Hey, see?
[227:12.99]There we go.
[227:14.51]He's doing okay.
[227:17.07]You be ready for your tournament tomorrow.
[227:19.79]And no, you have the tournament tomorrow.
[227:21.15]You're good.
[227:23.45]How are you doing over here?
[227:29.99]You're always hungry.
[227:34.33]Wait, what, I got beef?
[227:36.29]Alright, will you like me if you do robot animals eat beef?
[227:41.64]Yeah, he liked it.
[227:42.28]Good.
[227:42.48]He loved it.
[227:45.48]Now he's happy.
[227:46.12]Now he's lively.
[227:46.70]Good.
[227:49.23]So now it's time to proceed.
[227:51.21]And it's a competition tomorrow.
[227:59.54]Right, yeah.
[228:00.06]Tomorrow it is Wall-E.
[228:01.10]Here we go.
[228:13.29]Wally is lively.
[228:14.25]He needs maybe a little bit of food.
[228:16.97]Now, do you think you need food?
[228:18.62]Do you need food?
[228:23.60]What's on the schedule for today?
[228:24.92]Meditation for Wally.
[228:28.04]Rest.
[228:30.16]Yeah, you can have two days off.
[228:31.65]And exercise for you.
[228:33.91]And then it's your tournament tonight.
[228:36.09]We'll feed you after this.
[228:43.93]Not bad.
[228:50.03]Hungry.
[228:50.53]Let's get you some food.
[228:51.65]I'm kind of running out of food.
[228:54.25]He's like my uncle with the food bag.
[229:01.09]Should be good, right?
[229:02.91]Yeah.
[229:03.21]Focused.
[229:04.45]Not hungry.
[229:05.50]Not that tired.
[229:06.10]What about you?
[229:08.52]You okay?
[229:13.75]You're doing a good job.
[229:14.37]Does he have a bacon diaper?
[229:23.89]What do you mean a bacon diaper?
[229:30.13]Oh, you mean that.
[229:31.81]Like a bacon-wrapped scallop.
[229:37.31]I had no idea what the hell you're talking about, please.
[229:42.72]Alright, let's see if Wall-E can win a tournament.
[229:57.51]The Christmas Cup.
[229:58.97]Merry Christmas.
[230:05.43]Let's begin.
[230:07.61]Chara, still stuck in the shitty chicken league.
[230:14.13]And then Youth K. Youth K. So this is me.
[230:23.41]Insanely high defense.
[230:25.43]Good intelligence.
[230:26.67]Not bad speed.
[230:27.44]Let's see.
[230:28.10]Oh, no, no, no.
[230:35.90]Really fast.
[230:37.78]But terrible at almost every single thing that matters.
[230:41.62]It'll be hard to hit.
[230:45.23]Shouldn't be a problem.
[230:45.87]Let's go.
[230:53.57]What's my title?
[230:55.45]Oh, this is an awful title.
[230:56.57]Another placeholder title that I forgot to change.
[231:00.04]Creating Life.
[231:04.30]Whatever.
[231:04.64]Alright, Wally.
[231:09.64]Let's go.
[231:10.98]Bring it on.
[231:12.36]Ooh!
[231:13.97]Right off the bat, aggressive!
[231:16.60]Party Cracker.
[231:17.18]Do it again.
[231:20.54]Double Party Cracker and I'll see you later.
[231:25.98]Nope.
[231:26.16]Alright.
[231:27.74]Dodged it all.
[231:28.28]I get really, really good defense though, even if I get hit.
[231:38.37]Still timid.
[231:41.03]Still timid.
[231:43.09]Come on.
[231:44.91]Come on!
[231:47.03]He can't do a move either, we're both in such a weird position.
[231:52.82]Oh my god.
[231:55.10]Oh my god!
[231:55.86]I have so many guts, just... This is kind of bad right now, Wally.
[232:01.51]What the fuck is going on here?
[232:04.91]Timid, like, four times in a row?
[232:06.97]Five?
[232:07.35]Like, I can't even do his basic attack!
[232:11.23]He's blocking everything!
[232:13.68]Helvana?
[232:14.46]What was- what is that?
[232:15.14]12% hit chance!
[232:19.18]32 per- he- okay, that makes him have even harder- he's harder to hit.
[232:31.79]Lucky, actually.
[232:32.99]That was a bad display, Wally.
[232:39.43]That's a great dance, though.
[232:43.93]Alright, Tyra, Youth K. Youth K is one of those dogs with the... One of those dogs with the hats on.
[232:52.32]Alright, Youth K and Wally, let's see.
[232:54.84]Oh my god.
[232:55.67]What the hell is this?
[233:09.34]Did you forget to train other things?
[233:11.34]482 intelligence.
[233:15.64]No accuracy, no speed, no defense, no power.
[233:19.06]What does your move even move?
[233:20.30]Scratch is the move to look out for.
[233:22.34]Alright.
[233:29.18]We're gonna give it a try.
[233:35.95]RNG just needs one hit.
[233:45.10]Alright.
[233:49.86]Let's go.
[233:51.64]Let's do it again.
[233:53.62]Oh god, is this it?
[233:54.74]Let's headbang.
[233:55.48]63% chance to hit this.
[233:58.40]Yeah, you're dead.
[234:02.74]Back to the drawing board with these stats.
[234:11.07]What a dumb character.
[234:21.77]I guess that would work, but your hit chance is probably at 8-9%, always.
[234:28.62]Maybe even worse.
[234:32.90]What's the point of having all that intelligence?
[234:38.31]Dermot, can you enable Pog?
[234:39.67]Like, PogChamp?
[234:43.37]It already is enabled, it's a global emote.
[234:53.44]Alright, first week of January.
[234:54.52]I think it is... Vroomer has a competition coming up here, right?
[234:59.04]Tonight?
[235:00.79]Yes.
[235:01.83]Vroomer has a competition today.
[235:06.09]And you're not that tired, so let's see what we got here.
[235:08.39]Trampoline for Vroomer.
[235:10.79]Get that speed increase.
[235:12.75]Okay.
[235:15.33]Are you tired?
[235:18.11]Are you resting today?
[235:19.25]Yes, you should be.
[235:21.63]You're also resting today.
[235:24.24]No, that's... I'm sorry.
[235:25.82]Get back in the training.
[235:33.24]Enable pog.
[235:36.26]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[235:37.30]Enable pog.
[235:45.65]Pog is the zoomed-in version of PogChamp.
[235:53.75]Lively, how are you doing?
[235:54.73]Are you on the trampoline?
[235:59.59]Focus, let's get some food in you.
[236:01.61]Just a little potato, just something easy so you can crash on the competition.
[236:06.86]First, time in D rank for a moment.
[236:17.92]D rank, 1500 bucks.
[236:20.77]Let's see who the competition is now.
[236:26.55]you want a better PogChamp just use Jerm of Venus yeah I think come on groomer Carl farrell and Bob alright this is it's Carl high HP
[236:49.92]But not a threat anywhere else besides an intelligence.
[236:52.68]What are your moves?
[236:53.90]A lot of intelligence moves.
[236:56.43]Shouldn't be a problem, though.
[236:57.29]Just get the little one down.
[237:13.31]Carl's just one of those plants.
[237:18.33]No, not very much defense.
[237:19.63]Just go in there.
[237:23.85]Polish.
[237:25.33]Blocked it.
[237:28.45]Hmm, really?
[237:32.51]I'm gonna back it up a little bit then.
[237:33.69]No, no, no, no, don't.
[237:34.57]That's his intelligence boost back there.
[237:35.79]I don't want him to have any... No, that's not good.
[237:40.05]25% chance to hit.
[237:44.15]I'm gonna stay forward though, because all of his moves are terrible besides the ones at range.
[237:49.99]Nope, stay in.
[237:50.55]Damn.
[237:51.08]Karli, you're killing me here.
[238:00.13]Oh, this is bad.
[238:01.69]Oh fuck, this is bad.
[238:09.88]I have to hit him with something, otherwise I'm going to die.
[238:13.90]35% chance to hit.
[238:14.84]He's got a 66% chance to hit.
[238:16.40]Back it up.
[238:20.17]That, like, Nirvana thing is ridiculous.
[238:27.45]No!
[238:28.33]That was kind of a last-ditch effort there.
[238:32.75]Thank God.
[238:33.29]Alright.
[238:34.32]I'll stay in the middle.
[238:35.46]Percentage-wise, where does that put me?
[238:37.40]It's pretty close, actually.
[238:40.95]Block it.
[238:41.19]Good.
[238:42.21]Block it!
[238:44.33]Yes!
[238:45.03]Okay.
[238:46.01]Getting close.
[238:49.91]Perfect.
[238:50.23]Again.
[238:50.43]Quick, quick, quick.
[238:50.93]Composed.
[238:54.28]Got it.
[238:57.94]What does that mean, composed?
[239:02.30]Thankfully I blocked the two dots.
[239:04.26]That would have been bad.
[239:08.40]Farrell and Bob.
[239:13.31]Pretty close.
[239:14.53]Bob wins.
[239:18.17]Alright, Bob.
[239:23.09]Fairly balanced.
[239:26.43]Head throw, head swing, boomerang, fat belly, and nasty.
[239:34.28]Fairly balanced character.
[239:36.92]Decent power.
[239:38.28]Decent life.
[239:39.00]You kind of just spread out all over the place, don't you?
[239:44.29]Oh, and he's also nasty.
[239:55.20]It's another one of those weird ducks, but this is not a pumpkin.
[239:57.36]This one is made out of stone.
[240:02.84]Let's get in there right away.
[240:04.12]He's got nothing close.
[240:07.84]Back it up.
[240:08.24]There's nothing far away here.
[240:14.76]Oh, he just got destroyed.
[240:16.48]Alright, now I'm gonna take it in close.
[240:22.70]Oh, it's just... I... Those two moves are really good.
[240:28.71]Unfortunately, the one in the back doesn't have a high percentage, but if it hits, it's good.
[240:31.63]That's some easy money.
[240:41.11]I gotta take him... out.
[240:43.85]To learn new moves.
[240:44.55]And I got a squid.
[240:48.99]And six new fans.
[240:54.89]When do you get to milk your monsters?
[241:02.11]What the fuck?
[241:05.17]You... uh...
[241:07.87]How did I read that one?
[241:08.95]I don't know, because I looked over and it was there.
[241:10.45]That's so fucking stupid.
[241:15.83]Alright, trampoline... Okay, let's do some more tournaments scheduled out here.
[241:26.02]Can't do this as an official one.
[241:29.72]The next one available for rumor is here.
[241:34.65]And then... Over here is Roberto.
[241:39.23]And we'll do Wally on this one.
[241:41.80]So this string here on... February is the tournament week.
[241:45.72]Or month.
[241:48.60]We'll do some more... Just resting and training in January.
[241:55.68]Alright, how tired is everybody?
[242:01.03]Everyone's pretty good, actually.
[242:04.59]Begin.
[242:11.38]Ten accuracy.
[242:12.66]Good.
[242:14.42]I have to bring... At some point here.
[242:18.00]I gotta bring him back to adventure.
[242:25.91]D and E. What babies.
[242:28.55]Not for long.
[242:30.71]He's gonna be up at C after the next tournament if I win it.
[242:35.61]Do my parents watch my stream?
[242:39.31]Oh yeah, my mom and dad are both subbed.
[242:45.01]I need to feed.
[242:45.71]You are always hungry.
[242:46.49]No, not you.
[242:51.45]You're always hungry.
[242:54.17]Here.
[242:54.57]No, you don't get that.
[242:55.57]Yes, you do.
[242:57.30]I think he's the only one that wants to eat it.
[243:05.60]Alright.
[243:06.20]Rest up.
[243:06.68]Everyone's kind of tired.
[243:10.39]Good work.
[243:14.33]What do we need to work on here?
[243:19.15]155.
[243:19.47]He's across the board.
[243:20.39]He's pretty good.
[243:26.92]Accuracy is kind of lacking, though.
[243:29.54]Accuracy and intelligence.
[243:32.65]Or maybe Accuracy and Power.
[243:33.95]Accuracy and Life.
[243:34.71]No, hold on.
[243:37.42]Accuracy and Life is what I want to do.
[243:46.36]And Rest here.
[244:03.39]And then do life.
[244:04.45]It's going to be close to the tournament, though.
[244:06.02]We'll see what happens after that.
[244:08.72]Now you, rumor... What can you do here?
[244:13.62]Rest?
[244:14.96]Yeah.
[244:15.46]Rest and then trampoline.
[244:19.60]Yeah, I'll take the power and trampoline.
[244:21.40]That sounds good.
[244:25.93]Proceed.
[244:35.98]February week two is the first tournament.
[244:41.00]Not that focused.
[244:47.17]Can we throw Roberto into a meat grinder?
[244:49.97]Hold on there.
[244:52.49]Wait till he shows himself in battle.
[244:54.85]And then we'll decide that.
[245:04.27]Level 9 intelligence for Wall-E.
[245:08.03]Roberto, not so good.
[245:14.61]Frustrated.
[245:15.15]Hey, you can do better.
[245:19.36]Just relax.
[245:23.14]Roberto's not a waste of space.
[245:25.32]He's just tired.
[245:26.72]And he's gonna rest this week.
[245:35.25]Food you need to eat.
[245:36.01]Have a mango.
[245:43.67]Would you throw a fork into your garbage disposal?
[245:49.26]No.
[245:50.24]I actually... I would not.
[245:51.22]That's a good idea.
[245:52.22]What about a carrot?
[245:54.80]Yeah, have a carrot.
[245:55.68]You're gonna like this.
[245:57.26]You won a good tournament.
[245:58.52]You deserve it.
[246:02.57]I'm running out of food.
[246:04.14]I have to buy food.
[246:04.98]He's focused for his tournament.
[246:06.94]Roberto.
[246:10.52]Eh.
[246:15.24]Alright.
[246:20.40]Two more weeks.
[246:21.92]The way we raise Vroomer from this point on will determine the difference between victory and defeat.
[246:30.71]What does that mean?
[246:33.95]Does he look sadder than usual?
[246:35.13]He looks sad today.
[246:36.47]I don't know why.
[246:38.37]Anyone catching that?
[246:43.40]He's gonna do the trampoline.
[246:47.42]Trampoline and then rest.
[246:49.06]And then you can do exercise.
[246:52.00]The tournament is here.
[246:53.24]Now, trampoline, exercise, exercise, rest.
[247:01.59]Yeah, that looks good.
[247:04.20]And you have the tournament here.
[247:05.42]So we're going to do, yep.
[247:08.76]Now there you go.
[247:09.58]Target.
[247:10.62]Rest.
[247:13.20]Oh, we need a resting now.
[247:14.70]Rest.
[247:15.42]And then power.
[247:20.41]And we'll have to see because you're really tired.
[247:22.39]So you can rest.
[247:23.25]Go for it.
[247:27.83]Alright.
[247:30.13]Pretty successful day.
[247:37.46]Freeze him before he dies so he can live forever.
[247:39.38]Yeah, I'm gonna use his body for another DNA.
[247:44.77]Good work.
[247:45.37]I don't have any food for you, but I'll say good job.
[247:51.87]Yeah, Wally's doing a really good job training.
[247:54.61]A lot of, like, plus eight, plus nine.
[248:01.35]Very lively.
[248:03.79]Okay, so now...
[248:08.18]Very good job.
[248:08.86]You too.
[248:17.88]You are just doing okay.
[248:20.04]But you're also just resting, so... What about food?
[248:24.14]I gotta give you something before the tournament.
[248:26.98]You like squid?
[248:31.47]Yeah, you do.
[248:37.42]Glad the heavy dialog is gone.
[248:38.86]It makes the game much more enjoyable.
[248:42.37]Yeah.
[248:43.73]It kind of just had to get us here, though.
[248:47.05]That, like, first 45 minutes of just kind of... TV show talking.
[248:50.99]And look at the sacred tree!
[248:52.35]I don't even remember that thing's name.
[248:56.48]Oh yeah, save the game.
[248:57.58]Speaking of lair.
[248:58.36]Okay, I'll have to do it from, like, the other menu.
[249:09.35]Alright.
[249:12.65]February, week one.
[249:15.27]Hello, how are things?
[249:16.25]Need anything today?
[249:16.93]Go ahead, take a look around.
[249:18.41]Alright.
[249:20.11]I'll pray.
[249:22.04]Buy.
[249:22.52]What can I buy?
[249:23.22]Training.
[249:26.24]Sandbag.
[249:26.88]A better sandbag.
[249:29.92]I got lots of money, so... The Life Blade.
[249:32.90]That's the thing.
[249:35.63]One by one, let's get this.
[249:46.85]Life Blade.
[249:48.97]Put it right here.
[249:49.79]Perfect fit.
[249:50.83]That's the thing he made, right?
[249:56.35]Mmm... Probably... Sandbag is... Yeah.
[250:02.50]I'm gonna need this.
[250:09.12]Sandbag is... Perfect fit right here.
[250:13.35]And I can do one more here, whatever it's going to be.
[250:21.96]This one is a book, target, trampoline, tub.
[250:25.86]I feel like I want the tub.
[250:28.06]Tub.
[250:44.70]Anything else, that's it.
[250:48.32]So what is appraise?
[250:49.88]I had appraise one, but you don't have a stone tablet.
[250:52.65]Oh, right, okay.
[250:55.01]Sell, buy, enter.
[250:58.79]What will you do?
[250:59.39]I will end.
[251:00.33]Yes.
[251:07.36]So now today...
[251:10.76]It is Roberto's tournament.
[251:13.29]He's going to rest today because he's already still tired.
[251:16.63]Why are you still tired?
[251:19.39]But here's the thing now.
[251:20.05]So balance.
[251:20.85]I can change this to the life blade.
[251:30.31]And then exercise can be changed to the sandbag.
[251:44.77]exercise can be changed to say I know yeah yeah you need it more than he does you just you know what once you're lovely yet let's do like yeah you do the life blade let's see what happened
[252:07.98]Plus 10.
[252:08.46]Nice.
[252:10.21]He needed that actually pretty bad.
[252:11.89]Roberto, plus 7.
[252:16.15]Is this his Shake Weight?
[252:18.71]It looks like he's stuck in an animation or something.
[252:24.98]Like he's glitching through the wall.
[252:29.20]And then there's the Sandbag.
[252:33.28]He's out of control.
[252:38.83]Alright.
[252:40.63]I need food.
[252:41.79]I'm running out of food.
[252:43.85]Eat a banana.
[252:44.31]I'm gonna have to go to town and buy some stuff.
[252:55.66]You're fine.
[252:56.24]Alright, that's it.
[253:00.87]How much money do I have?
[253:10.08]Hold on, let me just swallow this banana.
[253:14.40]Shrine, association, item shop.
[253:17.30]Oh, welcome.
[253:18.92]Well, what will you do?
[253:21.00]I will buy.
[253:22.68]Which will you buy?
[253:23.54]I will buy... Lot of rain, okay.
[253:28.21]Mushroom.
[253:28.83]The common mushroom is cheap, but it's not very filling or tasty.
[253:33.39]Cheap and filling, so it's a breeder's standard.
[253:35.35]Let's get a few of these.
[253:38.66]This is the one you want to buy, right?
[253:40.14]Can I increase the... There we go.
[253:43.46]I will take five potatoes.
[253:51.09]I will also hit energy bar.
[253:52.71]Like a cookie, it charges up your monster fast.
[253:55.83]I feel like I want a couple of these.
[253:59.17]Just in case.
[254:00.77]And then maybe a couple of bananas?
[254:03.40]Three bananas?
[254:05.32]Yeah.
[254:11.02]And then Yarn Ball Junk Toy.
[254:15.23]Pretty old.
[254:15.89]I found this, didn't I?
[254:16.95]Looks great as a toy.
[254:19.43]How do I do this?
[254:19.99]How do I use this?
[254:23.40]Beef.
[254:24.14]500 bucks for beef.
[254:27.28]That's too much.
[254:27.86]He's gonna have to eat potatoes.
[254:29.14]I'll get like a bunch of potatoes.
[254:33.51]There's four games?
[254:34.11]There's actually five games.
[254:36.37]There's one after this, too.
[254:37.89]But apparently the one after this is awful.
[254:43.70]Is what I've heard.
[254:49.46]I've heard Evo is a unbearable... Wow.
[254:53.80]That's $1,500.
[254:54.16]That's wrong?
[254:58.50]I mean, everybody told me Evo was terrible.
[255:02.97]That's... I heard it was not good.
[255:04.57]Doesn't it have like a 45 on Metacritic or something?
[255:08.66]Wow.
[255:09.72]Oh, wow.
[255:11.36]Battle cards?
[255:12.14]Should I just sell this?
[255:17.36]The DS ones are good.
[255:18.28]Maybe I'll try those eventually.
[255:21.73]Can I use the perfume for any reason besides just to sell it?
[255:23.93]I mean, the cards... What am I gonna... They're gonna play cards together?
[255:30.51]Just sell it.
[255:37.07]The Game Boy ones are good.
[255:43.36]Which one's the best?
[255:44.00]I think Monster Rancher 2 is the best one.
[255:49.78]But this one's not bad.
[255:50.92]This one's actually growing on me here.
[256:02.38]Most fans agree it's 2 or the second one for DS.
[256:06.62]I could see it, too.
[256:07.44]It just was very straightforward, but it was fun.
[256:09.59]It was very basic, but that's why it was so good.
[256:13.81]It seems like every other game, they've tried to add a bunch of weird shit that nobody really wanted.
[256:18.03]They just want to breed monsters and fight monsters.
[256:23.01]But this one is... I don't hate this one.
[256:25.41]This one's actually really fun.
[256:26.77]I don't mind this one.
[256:33.58]We're talking about Sekiro?
[256:35.47]Yeah, I completed Sekiro on the last stream.
[256:41.07]If you didn't catch the last couple streams, it was Sekiro.
[256:43.27]Actually, the last, like, five streams in a row were Sekiro.
[256:47.79]So, it's time for the tournament.
[256:49.53]You're just doing okay.
[256:50.61]That's not good.
[256:54.44]It was easy.
[256:55.22]No, it was not.
[256:56.76]Not even the slightest...
[257:00.62]You are... Oh, you're gonna rest right now anyway, so that's fine.
[257:04.14]And then we'll see what you can do in battle.
[257:06.82]I'm looking forward to it.
[257:07.52]So now you, Life Blade, and Sandbag.
[257:13.50]And then it's time to bring Roberto into a... That's so cute.
[257:16.78]I can't wait to go look at that.
[257:20.24]Look at this.
[257:25.24]Is that in his mouth?
[257:26.52]Or in his hands?
[257:31.58]He's jiggling the thing around.
[257:32.94]Oh, he's getting tired.
[257:34.74]Alright, too much work.
[257:38.04]Okay.
[257:38.20]I can't do it again.
[257:42.52]I'm trying.
[257:43.04]Alright, you're fine.
[257:48.33]Eat a potato.
[257:49.35]Feel better.
[258:00.63]He's praying at a bonfire.
[258:05.84]How you doing?
[258:07.56]Mr. Cheese Wheel, are you good?
[258:09.74]Tired, oh boy.
[258:11.36]Did I overwork you?
[258:12.12]You look like Cherry.
[258:18.48]From Pee-Wee's Playhouse.
[258:19.74]Come on.
[258:22.21]You can do it.
[258:30.73]You can do it.
[258:33.47]He's fine.
[258:37.17]There you go.
[258:37.63]See?
[258:37.85]That's all he needed.
[258:39.11]Some encouragement.
[258:43.16]So you're very lively and you're focused for your fight stint.
[258:46.34]You, on the other hand, use your food.
[258:47.98]You can just have a potato.
[258:59.55]Good.
[259:02.52]Alright, let's see if I can steamroll this competition.
[259:08.22]It makes it really hard.
[259:15.15]To kind of juggle three monsters, four monsters at the same time.
[259:26.12]Before, you just had the one monster, and you worked the hell out of them.
[259:30.98]Now you've got a whole family.
[259:32.64]This is Roberto versus Gaddy.
[259:42.59]We remember Gaddy.
[259:44.29]Has Gaddy improved at all?
[259:45.41]Let's find out.
[259:46.89]Not at all.
[259:51.63]Gaddy has not even trained one stat.
[260:04.50]That's fine.
[260:04.90]You can go against my Smurf.
[260:12.77]Mmm, a little timid.
[260:13.61]That's a lot of damage.
[260:18.17]Ball it up with a kick.
[260:26.54]I mean, you may as well just have that be somebody's dog now.
[260:29.18]You know what I mean?
[260:29.84]Like, just don't... Why are you fighting here?
[260:33.43]That should be like a lap dog just sitting on somebody's stomach while they're lying down on the couch.
[260:40.45]What is that dog doing here?
[260:48.19]That should be somebody's friend.
[260:50.73]Why are they here?
[260:51.99]You're fighting like a giant robot with a sword in his hand.
[261:00.38]See?
[261:00.76]Like, come on.
[261:05.40]It's the alias.
[261:10.20]164 in accuracy.
[261:10.86]That's pretty good.
[261:12.84]It's not gonna be enough, though.
[261:23.91]We come from a similar, uh... I think a similar breed.
[261:37.54]Oh, nice dodge.
[261:43.48]Alright, fine.
[261:48.05]Alright, do it again.
[261:51.79]Ready.
[261:52.73]Okay, fine.
[261:54.53]Uh, that one?
[262:00.33]What's a defense on with that guy?
[262:01.61]I forget.
[262:02.98]It can't be that good.
[262:07.15]There you go.
[262:07.89]See you later.
[262:11.94]Demon Doll.
[262:20.91]Gatty actually won a fight.
[262:25.59]Shocking.
[262:27.25]We've fought Kylon before.
[262:29.21]He's fast.
[262:30.83]And has good accuracy.
[262:39.35]Losing to Gaddy.
[262:42.21]What an embarrassment.
[262:49.67]Double charge, do it again.
[262:50.47]Or kick it.
[262:53.53]That's it.
[262:56.11]Now, final guts!
[263:03.36]This doesn't feel right.
[263:08.53]I think he's ready.
[263:09.15]Roberto!
[263:18.01]That was BM.
[263:18.43]800 bucks 7 fame.
[263:18.95]And you guys wanted to retire him.
[263:38.27]I wonder how long they live in this one.
[263:43.69]Actually, it's time to go pee.
[263:46.19]It's probably going to be the final pee of the night.
[263:48.75]I'll be right back.
[264:16.70]so so
[264:54.38]so so
[265:24.68]you
[266:25.33]Alright.
[266:35.51]So where are we now?
[266:36.79]Vroomer has a tournament today.
[266:44.34]Wally has tournament two.
[266:45.84]This is class D. And then...
[266:51.95]One more of these and we can move to C. So I don't... I want you to rest right now.
[266:59.60]Hold on.
[267:01.78]Rest.
[267:02.46]And then you... Get in the tub.
[267:08.46]And you...
[267:17.92]What was he doing before?
[267:20.38]Balance, right?
[267:22.28]Lifeblade.
[267:24.56]Use the new things we bought.
[267:32.00]Bad.
[267:34.33]Really bad.
[267:35.45]Six only?
[267:36.19]Come on.
[267:36.71]You're in the tub now.
[267:37.55]I mean, it's absolutely adorable, but... Look at six points.
[267:52.13]Oh, this is improving defense.
[267:55.01]I guess he's running out of the way?
[267:58.89]We haven't seen him do this yet.
[268:04.62]What a weird way to increase your HP.
[268:06.56]Alright, you... I'm sorry, but come on.
[268:10.94]You can do better than that.
[268:12.02]I know you can.
[268:15.70]You too.
[268:23.72]They can do better than that.
[268:25.36]I know they can.
[268:26.14]You're just resting, okay.
[268:29.84]So you have a tournament.
[268:32.67]Let's give you, uh, potato.
[268:35.69]There's something with starch in it, so you can get some carbs.
[268:42.41]How do you increase your HP?
[268:44.69]You don't.
[268:45.35]Your HP, uh, it gradually reduces from the second that you're born.
[268:48.74]It starts at 100.
[269:00.47]I mean, you can slow the damage over time.
[269:03.03]You know, if you eat carrots and shit.
[269:07.04]But eventually you're going to zero.
[269:25.83]Increase my HP.
[269:28.73]I'm not gonna answer that question.
[269:37.54]Spring Wind League.
[269:41.86]Okay, this is the next Class D. Carl, Merry, and Nat.
[269:50.91]This is Rumor versus Nat.
[269:52.73]Let's see, Nat.
[269:56.60]Uh, none of the physical moves are dangerous.
[269:59.18]Pretty slow.
[270:00.86]But has fairly decent IQ moves.
[270:03.92]Thunder and attack.
[270:06.46]Look out for Thunder.
[270:07.36]Their traits are super weapon.
[270:08.78]What the hell does that mean?
[270:11.24]Stay within the magic.
[270:25.32]Another weird pumpkin.
[270:30.19]Why can't we get one of these weirdos?
[270:31.63]Alright, stay- it's- it's- it's far away.
[270:37.15]Get in close.
[270:39.63]Any of the moves that they- that they can do from far away.
[270:41.41]Don't even let him do it.
[270:46.43]It's a two-shot.
[270:47.19]That's it.
[270:47.69]It's over.
[270:50.06]That was a lot of damage.
[270:54.10]I might get this character to, like, C or B tonight.
[270:57.78]Remember how long it took us to get from D to C, C to B in Monster Hunter 2?
[271:04.86]It was hard.
[271:05.52]Nobody stays a chance.
[271:10.48]Alright, is this Mer- Merry...
[271:21.35]Mary sucks.
[271:22.83]Let's take a look at you anyways.
[271:25.03]The stats really aren't even bad.
[271:26.43]Just watch out for the magic.
[271:29.61]It's a pretty cool toad, though.
[271:47.84]We had a toad before.
[271:58.54]That hurts so much.
[271:59.56]Let's do another two-shot, what do you say?
[272:04.20]Goodbye.
[272:06.60]Awww.
[272:08.23]Toothpaste Toad.
[272:12.23]Uh-oh.
[272:13.83]Don't talk shit, it's very- it's really easy for you to lose.
[272:15.81]I only have 150 health.
[272:16.41]Uh-oh.
[272:16.77]Uh...
[272:27.47]Oh god.
[272:28.43]I talked shit and it's gonna come back and haunt me.
[272:30.95]I can't even- I have to do this move.
[272:32.01]I have to get a long shot here and end it.
[272:37.96]Oh, he's bullish!
[272:39.42]Oh no, this is it!
[272:46.06]Oh no.
[272:48.96]I talked a lot of shit there.
[272:51.37]It's okay, I can still win.
[272:52.53]Carl has to lose.
[273:00.36]I have to beat Carl right now.
[273:05.78]200 health.
[273:07.64]Nothing else, though.
[273:10.86]Just high HP.
[273:22.45]Dammit.
[273:24.01]Well, I had to lose once.
[273:24.97]It was gonna happen eventually.
[273:27.02]Alright, Carl.
[273:35.30]What's the percentage here?
[273:36.98]52?
[273:38.50]Alright, good, good.
[273:44.45]Just beat him.
[273:45.73]Pull back a little.
[273:46.55]50%?
[273:46.57]Good work.
[273:46.83]51.
[273:46.93]Stay back.
[273:49.39]44%?
[273:49.47]Try it.
[274:04.30]Accuracy is the big deal here.
[274:05.80]Look at this.
[274:06.24]This is bad.
[274:08.90]We are working on that.
[274:09.88]Oh, fuck you with this final bullshit.
[274:12.65]Uh-oh.
[274:16.77]We found the thing we need to work on, because... that's a... that's not good.
[274:33.35]My defense is good.
[274:34.15]I'm blocking a lot of hits.
[274:36.49]Accuracy.
[274:37.61]I'm not doing so well.
[274:43.09]49%.
[274:44.54]Okay, good.
[274:46.78]Still a chance to win this.
[274:50.86]Do I have the accuracy... upgrade?
[274:57.15]Alright, Carl.
[275:01.68]Winner of this terrific battle is Rumor.
[275:03.46]That's because I beat Carl.
[275:15.75]Nice.
[275:16.13]Just barely.
[275:16.53]$1,500 and a squid.
[275:20.87]We have to get you into accuracy training right now.
[275:29.54]Right now.
[275:33.43]Good work, but still.
[275:34.55]You gotta win one more of those.
[275:35.55]Let me see you here.
[275:40.17]Accuracy is really... 159.
[275:40.91]It's really not even that bad.
[275:44.29]It needs to be higher.
[275:50.41]Being at less than 50% sucks.
[275:54.53]I guess it also depends on their speed, too.
[275:58.65]His health is terrible.
[275:59.61]Accuracy and health.
[276:00.43]His defense is terrible, too.
[276:07.73]I'll do Accuracy and Health for now.
[276:11.45]On rumor.
[276:11.91]I'm going to look at the calendar here, because I need to win one more.
[276:15.13]We'll do this one.
[276:19.36]Because that gives us one, two, yeah, okay.
[276:24.96]Let's go to Schedule.
[276:28.42]You don't actually, you don't even have to rest.
[276:29.64]You're good.
[276:33.10]Okay.
[276:33.98]Accuracy.
[276:34.50]And then the Life Stick.
[276:42.48]And then rest here.
[276:45.14]And then maybe... Well, life stick together.
[276:51.58]The rest of you know who has... Somebody has something today, right?
[276:56.86]You Wally does, okay.
[276:57.82]Wally is frustrated, so just rest, Wally.
[277:04.43]And then you don't have anything for a while, but you're still tired, so you may as well rest.
[277:10.09]Okay, let's go.
[277:17.25]There we go.
[277:18.37]Much better.
[277:20.27]Much better number.
[277:26.11]Uh, where is... Where's Wally?
[277:30.32]Sleeping, right?
[277:32.10]Alright, have a... No, have a potato.
[277:39.44]I love these potatoes.
[277:40.22]It's just really easy to get them borrowed.
[277:41.73]Enable pog!
[277:48.61]Well, that means I have to get rid of something.
[277:54.53]What am I going to get rid of?
[277:55.68]I have only... I have five slots.
[277:56.96]I'm not going to get rid of anything.
[277:58.18]I have to get rid of, um... FeelsBadMan.
[278:02.04]I'm going to have to get rid of MonkaS.
[278:06.20]I only get five.
[278:18.12]Okay, very lively.
[278:18.88]Yeah, you're good.
[278:22.55]Okay, Wally's good for his tournament.
[278:25.41]The February Cup.
[278:48.72]Okay.
[278:50.18]Chavez, Agassiz, and Yuuki.
[278:54.63]This is against Yuuki.
[279:01.07]Really low defense.
[279:02.89]Not a threat.
[279:04.94]Just do... Just do physical attacks.
[279:20.61]Some of these, like, weird duck-dog-hat combinations.
[279:24.63]Alright, Wall-E, show them.
[279:28.39]Show them what you got.
[279:34.07]Wall-E.
[279:35.75]What the fuck was that, Wall-E?
[279:37.01]Wall-E!
[279:40.53]Wall-E!
[279:49.85]And now, I can't hit him.
[279:53.17]I gotta stay in the middle.
[279:54.23]Stay in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, because he has no moves to mid-range.
[279:58.33]Oh, fuck.
[279:58.87]He pulled me forward.
[280:02.80]And now he's Composed.
[280:04.02]This is bad.
[280:09.00]Come on!
[280:09.80]Again, right off the bat.
[280:10.44]Do it, quick, quick, quick.
[280:11.04]Again, again, again.
[280:13.86]Yes!
[280:16.14]Good job.
[280:25.97]Chavez and Agassiz.
[280:28.53]Chavez win.
[280:33.03]Yuki versus Chavez.
[280:34.63]Not doing so good.
[280:38.10]Chavez is the one to beat here.
[280:41.52]Alright, so Agassiz.
[280:42.62]High intelligence, high speed, low defense.
[280:48.98]Stay away from the magic abilities, that's pretty much it.
[280:52.72]It's one of these cats.
[281:04.68]Alright, stay out of mid-range.
[281:08.80]And it started immediately, but I think I blocked it.
[281:13.76]I have to stay at long?
[281:14.86]No, actually, high intelligence.
[281:20.83]See what I mean here?
[281:21.51]This is gonna be hard.
[281:23.81]38%.
[281:23.97]Fuck me.
[281:27.99]Stay forward.
[281:28.71]There you go.
[281:37.12]You don't have very much power, right?
[281:40.42]That was really dumb.
[281:44.50]Nooo!
[281:46.77]I forgot my d- this defense is so high.
[281:52.25]So at least I have a 200 defense.
[281:55.93]Let's end it with the pop.
[282:02.40]Come on, let me be flashy.
[282:06.06]You're not gonna let me be flashy?
[282:08.18]22%.
[282:08.26]I still got it.
[282:22.84]Is that Mewtwo?
[282:27.20]No, it's just a regular Mew.
[282:31.03]Alright, Chavez.
[282:33.59]You're the... Why are you so good?
[282:38.75]Because you have good defense and good power.
[282:43.26]I have to hit you with intelligence stuff.
[282:47.88]Yeah, I gotta... I have to try to burn you quick.
[283:03.35]It's a rock bunny.
[283:07.04]Gotta go for this.
[283:07.84]See if I can hit it.
[283:09.78]He sprays bleak to it.
[283:16.61]There we go.
[283:20.11]Addled!
[283:22.95]Again.
[283:23.79]What does addled mean?
[283:35.56]That does more, somehow.
[283:36.64]Alright, easy.
[283:44.90]Try again?
[283:48.02]Nope.
[283:50.59]Stay in mid-range.
[283:52.31]Because he doesn't have shit in mid-range.
[283:54.87]And I'm gonna bounce back and shoot him.
[283:56.25]3, 2, 1, go.
[283:57.19]Not good.
[283:57.77]35% chance.
[284:06.60]I'm gonna hold on to my guts.
[284:07.48]I'm not gonna use it.
[284:10.39]I have to win this one.
[284:13.13]He's trying.
[284:13.67]He's trying to bridge... No!
[284:18.25]Ah!
[284:20.11]Shit.
[284:20.57]20% chance to hit him.
[284:24.15]Might just have to win this one by... playing defensively.
[284:33.84]Can't go back any further over the wall.
[284:43.21]One second left.
[284:43.87]It's alright, I still win.
[284:46.87]Do not do a move at the last second.
[284:48.35]Okay.
[284:52.46]Judges?
[284:53.84]Who wins?
[284:55.50]I do!
[285:00.32]Full-on victory.
[285:01.08]I like it.
[285:09.11]stalling tactics sometimes you gotta just wear them out please clap
[285:34.40]This is the final tournament before I can go into Seacup.
[285:44.88]So we got Lifeblade.
[285:46.83]We should probably do this in the other, yeah.
[285:49.87]Rest first.
[285:51.49]Do Lifeblade.
[285:53.33]Maybe Lifeblade again.
[285:56.29]This is the day of the tournament.
[285:58.99]So you rest.
[286:00.07]Nobody else has a tournament, right?
[286:03.74]Rest.
[286:04.06]Actually, you don't even need it.
[286:06.22]Just do balance.
[286:06.88]And... More defense.
[286:08.76]In the tub.
[286:10.04]Then you rest here.
[286:13.07]You, on the other hand, do the sandbag.
[286:31.80]get on the trampoline for speed and then you can rest here alright you're tired go to bed begin molly you're just really not that good with training it's just the fact you're on the level two
[287:01.39]Like, what is this?
[287:03.54]You were doing so good in the beginning.
[287:14.70]I know you did just win a tournament, but still.
[287:19.57]I know you can do better.
[287:20.81]He's trying his best.
[287:21.67]Yeah, but he's...
[287:24.07]He's been eating bananas and shit all day.
[287:27.27]Every day.
[287:29.08]You're doing just fine.
[287:30.50]I will praise you, because you just got 11 points.
[287:36.46]You're a cruel and hateful person.
[287:39.42]No, I'm not.
[287:40.02]You can't just praise him every day.
[287:42.04]They turn to shit.
[287:44.16]I did that to Beanbag Sonic, and he went all the way to the other side of the scale.
[287:49.66]And eventually he wouldn't even listen to me.
[287:50.98]Remember?
[288:02.51]Here.
[288:03.11]Here's your favorite thing.
[288:08.36]I just talked about how all he does is eat bananas, and I just gave him one.
[288:11.26]That's fine.
[288:11.70]Alright, how are you doing?
[288:13.52]We got a tournament coming through, right?
[288:16.16]How you doing?
[288:16.48]You sleeping?
[288:17.80]You need to eat.
[288:22.22]Oh, shit.
[288:22.50]I can't... Wait a minute.
[288:23.24]I can't do anything... Oh, no.
[288:25.92]That's not good.
[288:33.45]Oh, that's alright.
[288:37.81]Alright, you're good.
[288:43.51]Let's get some food.
[288:44.25]It's a life blade again for you.
[288:48.65]Life blade again.
[288:49.53]Maybe you should rest.
[288:52.61]Tub, rest.
[288:55.05]Trampoline, rest.
[288:56.52]They're all doing just fine.
[288:59.30]Bigot!
[289:02.25]Save the game.
[289:02.79]Yeah, I haven't saved the game in about four hours.
[289:07.77]That's actually really bad.
[289:09.24]You're right.
[289:09.60]That's awful.
[289:10.92]Something bad is gonna happen though.
[289:16.44]How do I even save the game?
[289:21.92]Look at how hungry you are.
[289:22.80]Come here, I got you.
[289:23.85]Are you full?
[289:35.14]I'm still hungry.
[289:37.54]Here.
[289:43.77]Did he not learn a new move?
[289:46.51]No, not yet.
[289:47.03]I have to bring him into the adventure mode thing.
[289:50.09]For them to learn new moves.
[289:51.71]I have to do that.
[289:52.43]Okay, after bringing... After getting to rank C, I have to get Rumor to a new move.
[290:11.12]For this one, they made it so you have to push reset on the console to save.
[290:13.85]That's really weird.
[290:20.55]Wasn't it somewhere in, like, weekend calendar?
[290:23.37]Where was it?
[290:25.09]Reader, book, belong... Isn't it, like, at the very beginning of each week?
[290:28.53]Yeah, it's at the beginning of each week.
[290:35.87]Hey, Jerma, got your nose.
[290:44.26]You don't, no you don't.
[290:45.26]Still on my face.
[290:45.90]I'm not stupid.
[290:48.34]There we go.
[290:56.20]Saving game.
[290:59.53]Turn on the face cam.
[291:00.33]What if I turn the face cam on and I... This whole time was having Voldemort-style makeup put on me.
[291:06.55]And that was just a plant in chat to write that.
[291:09.05]And I just had this flat fucking nothing there.
[291:13.30]I just start screaming.
[291:14.98]Screaming as loud as I can.
[291:19.38]And then I turn the stream off.
[291:22.28]April Fools.
[291:25.40]Alright, here we go.
[291:27.13]You have a tournament today.
[291:28.93]You're kind of tired, though.
[291:31.63]Just rest.
[291:34.55]You need to rest.
[291:35.59]You're frustrated, but it's okay.
[291:38.77]Everyone's resting today.
[291:40.31]Or just go to bed.
[291:41.09]All of you.
[291:46.21]That'd be the greatest thing I've ever seen And have a potato Jerma, please read this.
[292:02.56]I want to be the one guy Your wish is my command Alright
[292:18.23]Final tournament before I can do the rank up.
[292:22.23]Let's hope I win.
[292:26.99]And then we're that much closer to C rank.
[292:28.87]We're in C rank after that next one.
[292:39.51]Okay.
[292:41.01]Rumor, Fate, Bernard, and Gargani.
[292:46.30]Versus Fate.
[292:50.38]Tons of life.
[292:51.96]Not really that much of anything else.
[292:57.02]Just high health, that's all.
[293:00.78]And then I'm gonna take them all exploring for the next month.
[293:12.72]Just gotta hit hard.
[293:16.70]Good start.
[293:19.10]Good start.
[293:19.66]You got nothing in the back.
[293:20.40]54%.
[293:20.46]Let's give it a try.
[293:21.96]Not gonna happen.
[293:24.68]Helicopter.
[293:27.89]Good block.
[293:28.33]That's it.
[293:32.65]I gotta look at all my guts.
[293:33.55]He can't even do any moves.
[293:36.03]Did he use everything to try to do that?
[293:45.06]No guts.
[293:45.28]Just kill him.
[293:52.45]I had a nightmare about this thing.
[293:57.54]Hey, streamer, tell a funny joke.
[293:58.82]Okay.
[294:02.12]Nah, I got nothing.
[294:02.80]Sorry.
[294:03.82]Sorry.
[294:04.64]No jokes tonight.
[294:08.51]Alright, Bernard.
[294:13.59]Not that special, just a lot of health.
[294:18.95]The no joke joke.
[294:20.00]That's the one.
[294:22.10]Jermba lied about funny joke.
[294:29.08]That is fucking terrifying.
[294:31.76]It's just a giant mouth.
[294:33.72]That's just Pac-Man.
[294:42.75]It's Pac-Man with dentures in it.
[294:48.25]Nothing in the back.
[294:48.93]Let's go for the backspin.
[294:50.47]That would have been good, but... Try again.
[294:55.53]Come on.
[294:58.51]Those two coin flips in a row.
[295:00.81]Uh-oh.
[295:07.93]He doesn't have very many guts.
[295:13.62]Oh man, that's not good.
[295:14.70]What was his defense at?
[295:18.35]This is gonna come down to the end.
[295:20.55]I have to win this one.
[295:21.45]26.
[295:22.83]It's gonna be one hit for whoever.
[295:28.85]I gotta go for one in the back.
[295:31.49]I had to do it.
[295:33.51]Fuck.
[295:37.12]I can still do this.
[295:42.32]No, he's trying to close the gap.
[295:43.94]Oh, no.
[295:46.38]Oh, that's it.
[295:48.12]I- wait!
[295:48.80]I finally- I get to do this thing!
[295:52.43]What?
[295:52.79]No!
[295:53.57]Come on!
[295:55.53]Are you serious?
[295:58.73]He's got nothing in the back.
[296:00.69]Do it!
[296:02.49]Oh, you are killing me with this bullshit.
[296:06.68]This is bad, I'm gonna lose.
[296:11.58]Get back, back, back, back, back.
[296:12.54]Uhh, in the middle, right in the middle, right in the middle.
[296:15.68]How many guts do I have?
[296:18.62]I need... Come on!
[296:19.99]I need 15 guts!
[296:20.63]11, 12, 13, 14... That's over at least.
[296:33.34]Just missed... half the attacks I did.
[296:49.50]That dude's stats are way better than that guy's.
[296:51.70]I have like 200 attack.
[297:02.71]I just had to throw my dice in the air and lose.
[297:07.29]And his accuracy is almost as much as his attack power.
[297:12.23]He has like 200 accuracy.
[297:14.01]What the fuck?
[297:14.69]Look at this.
[297:17.59]You're at 170 accuracy and you still are at like 30-45%?
[297:24.83]How much more points do I have to put into this?
[297:27.99]Look at the speed, accuracy, that's like the... that's one of his... the top three.
[297:40.35]I gotta get him a new move.
[297:43.10]Alright, no more tournaments.
[297:46.26]You need a new move.
[297:49.93]Something for the mid-range.
[297:51.05]No tournaments.
[297:57.16]Yeah, you're all coming with me.
[297:58.52]Let's go.
[297:58.84]Um...
[298:11.68]Trampoline.
[298:12.16]It's speed.
[298:13.92]Let's do it again.
[298:15.28]Target.
[298:16.74]Target is fine.
[298:17.76]This is the tub, right?
[298:21.74]And then you don't need to rest.
[298:26.08]Sandbag.
[298:30.82]And then we're going to explore a cave.
[298:34.90]Plus 16. 16.
[298:41.95]That was actually really good.
[298:45.22]Alright, everyone's kinda hungry.
[298:49.36]Except for you, you're fine.
[298:55.60]You're frustrated and hungry.
[298:57.46]Never mind.
[299:00.64]Why don't you hear the biggest monster eat the others?
[299:15.47]Here.
[299:20.95]The brightness on your phone is low.
[299:25.59]I was unaware.
[299:27.18]Alright.
[299:30.06]Adventure.
[299:30.58]Take monster.
[299:31.36]Being raised.
[299:32.52]Exploring.
[299:36.88]Caves.
[299:39.86]You're all coming.
[299:40.94]All of you.
[299:45.79]7.46, start adventure.
[299:47.57]Hey Jerma, is your refrigerator running?
[300:03.32]Yeah, I grew legs and sprinted out of my house.
[300:06.48]And just sprint punched my roommate in the face.
[300:10.82]And started pissing all over my couch and rolling around on the ground and shit.
[300:19.64]And then it had been in a Kool-Aid man outside as hard as it could into my wall.
[300:23.12]There's glass and stuff.
[300:23.88]It was fucked up.
[300:24.56]I'm glad you noticed it.
[300:36.41]Then you better go catch it!
[300:38.55]Yeah, I really should, shouldn't I?
[300:42.91]You can't keep doing this stuff and blaming your fridge.
[300:57.06]Here we go.
[300:58.34]Random battle.
[301:02.68]Somebody's asked me, is the Fountain of Youth bullshit?
[301:08.37]Probably.
[301:09.95]I have no idea.
[301:10.51]He's dead.
[301:14.43]Instantly.
[301:20.57]He finally read it.
[301:21.49]What do you mean he finally read it?
[301:24.28]Level two, Vroomer.
[301:25.08]Anything new?
[301:25.50]What'd you get?
[301:25.90]Vroomer obtained Hard Head.
[301:29.47]Vroomer mastered Charge.
[301:33.21]Obtained Nunchaku.
[301:37.31]Nice.
[301:38.05]New move.
[301:42.32]He's been saying that for like two hours.
[301:53.48]Why?
[301:53.78]I don't know.
[301:57.36]What is that?
[301:57.76]Let me take a look at the data.
[302:03.84]Okay, so we got charge now.
[302:05.50]This is charge.
[302:08.90]17 guts.
[302:09.56]Life damage is C. Critical hit rating.
[302:13.34]Accuracy is guts damage.
[302:15.84]It's more accurate than anything that I have.
[302:18.39]Except for this.
[302:21.17]It's pretty cheap to do.
[302:22.03]It's cheaper to do than this.
[302:25.13]A little bit less damage than this.
[302:29.46]But it is fairly accurate.
[302:31.48]The move is kind of terrible.
[302:32.90]Alright, and he got hard head too.
[302:35.84]What the hell is a hard head?
[302:42.67]Wind Lore.
[302:44.21]Ups wind and fire power and lets you add a wind power to skill.
[302:48.65]Does it?
[302:49.77]And increases power of moves that use the head.
[302:54.88]Okay.
[303:09.01]All these streams are Jervis saying dumb stuff in chat repeating it.
[303:12.76]Wait, what?
[303:23.79]What was the dumb thing that I said today?
[303:25.53]I didn't say anything dumb!
[303:30.11]What did I say now?
[303:44.42]The refrigerator running thing?
[303:57.72]Can I hit this guy?
[304:14.06]Almost level two for the other ones.
[304:17.38]Do I need to equip this skill?
[304:20.22]It's not there.
[304:26.94]Oh, I see.
[304:30.29]Okay, so this is slot one.
[304:33.53]I can't have these... Okay, so that is a forward... It's a move in the front, short range.
[304:41.44]Alright.
[304:46.96]And backspin is going to be in the back.
[304:49.46]So I guess I'll just go like this in case I want to use it.
[304:56.20]Makes sense.
[304:58.18]It's not April Fools yet.
[305:02.76]Well, it is April Fools on the East Coast at the moment.
[305:11.21]So watch out for people playing tricks.
[305:16.53]Someone's gonna do something funny.
[305:19.25]And you're gonna believe them.
[305:20.21]Let's try the new move.
[305:25.48]Charge.
[305:28.31]A little too bullish.
[305:30.09]Still a little too bullish.
[305:31.19]Are you gonna die in here?
[305:35.77]That's a pretty good move.
[305:39.95]It's got a high hit percentage too, it seems.
[305:41.45]I gotta take you out.
[305:44.10]Get out of here.
[305:45.26]Or you die.
[305:56.20]Last hit.
[305:56.60]That's good.
[306:01.71]All the gifted subs are April Fool's jokes?
[306:05.80]Well, that would be pretty weird.
[306:08.64]Ah, almost.
[306:09.20]Another toy robot.
[306:17.11]Those things are stupid.
[306:19.39]Like, actually stupid.
[306:26.13]They don't even do anything.
[306:29.69]Why am I going that way?
[306:31.70]I'm wasting energy.
[306:32.52]Alright, next floor.
[306:33.31]This should level up the other two, and maybe they'll get some new stuff.
[306:36.49]Bingo.
[306:36.65]Damn.
[307:03.80]Just don't even let him get up.
[307:04.56]Keep doing it.
[307:04.98]70%.
[307:06.52]Nice.
[307:08.40]Alright.
[307:13.75]Here comes the new skills.
[307:15.85]For level 2.
[307:19.05]And?
[307:20.47]Wally obtained a sniper.
[307:24.51]Roberto obtained heavy armor.
[307:27.61]And got a junk toy.
[307:30.88]Anyway, let's see what that is.
[307:38.80]Sniper.
[307:40.02]Increases power of moves that throw or shoot.
[307:45.15]So that's gonna be much better for this move here.
[307:52.51]This cracker.
[307:55.79]No new ability though, unfortunately.
[307:57.40]Alright, what about, um, Birdo?
[308:00.20]No move, it was something else.
[308:02.64]Heavy armor.
[308:04.08]Reduces damage but harder to dodge.
[308:13.90]No new moves for either one of them.
[308:18.03]Alright, so what do you guys think?
[308:27.10]We've been playing for about just over five hours.
[308:29.22]Do you want to keep seeing this?
[308:32.48]Do you think we should continue?
[308:33.68]I think I'm going to continue playing this.
[308:49.34]This is branching like crazy now.
[308:56.50]Found the chest!
[308:59.12]Got a new move and we found... Ooh.
[309:02.82]Document 5.
[309:03.38]Where the hell's Document 5?
[309:07.14]Found the fifth Slenderman page.
[309:16.73]Is there any movies lately?
[309:17.89]I've seen... The last movie I saw was in the Spider-Verse.
[309:21.29]It's the last time I saw it in theaters.
[309:29.65]What is this?
[309:32.40]Rumor can't help you investigate.
[309:34.66]Anybody else?
[309:35.18]Come on, one of you guys can do this.
[309:43.10]Wally can't help you investigate.
[309:44.40]Nobody can dig?
[309:47.20]I mean, a sword is a shovel.
[309:49.62]Kind of.
[309:52.02]No.
[310:00.78]Okay.
[310:01.00]Why not Captain Marvel?
[310:03.10]Oh, I just haven't had a chance to go to the movies.
[310:14.77]Another way down.
[310:17.24]Do I dare go down again?
[310:18.76]542, that's not bad.
[310:24.18]Let's see what's on third floor.
[310:40.96]Roberto is way too loud.
[310:43.76]Yeah, he kind of is.
[310:44.64]They all are, though.
[310:45.48]They all have, like, a really loud single audio file that plays when they make a step.
[310:53.80]A big money just came in.
[310:57.06]And the community sucks.
[311:00.06]You guys are just showering me with money.
[311:03.86]You guys are just dropping money into my vacuum clean.
[311:09.64]Uh, let me pause this.
[311:10.50]Hold on.
[311:13.51]GermanLightAboutMinecraft, we have five community subs, first of all, thank you.
[311:17.41]And then... Gopher Yourself gave $60.
[311:27.02]Uh, thank you, Gopher.
[311:27.94]That's $60, 6,000 bits.
[311:35.36]How did this streamer beat the Demon of Hatred on the first try, but die to my elderly neighbor Bernard?
[311:41.78]I love this silly streamer.
[311:43.13]Haha.
[311:47.67]There's so much misinformation in that two sentences.
[311:54.63]But thank you, Gopher.
[311:57.89]Thank you for the 60 bucks.
[312:02.03]Oop.
[312:06.45]Funny lad.
[312:14.28]Rhino or Rhino-Rhine.
[312:17.22]That's kind of cool.
[312:19.90]It's like a Squirtle Mewtwo.
[312:20.96]When do you think he'll get a Sword Slash?
[312:27.65]I think it's going to take him to level 4 or 5 to get it.
[312:34.53]Jeremy, do you know if your earwax is brown, it means you're stressed out?
[312:38.98]Well, my earwax is... When I put, like, a little thing in my ear... The room is almost level three.
[312:47.54]Silver coin.
[312:48.93]Uh, when I... You... When I do a little earwax thing... You know, a Q-tip or something... I know you're not supposed to.
[312:54.93]But I do it anyways.
[312:56.57]I can't help it.
[312:58.93]That the entire Q-tip industry... Only survives...
[313:04.24]Only because people do the thing they're not supposed to do with a cupid.
[313:07.79]Put it in the ear.
[313:16.37]Um... But it's just... They're never dirty.
[313:22.66]They're always very clean.
[313:23.54]You know, what I typically like to do is in the shower, I do a little bit of washcloth and I go in the ear and move it around so I don't go deep in...
[313:36.57]Alright, we'll just double tap that guy.
[313:47.74]Jeremy only reads gross and rude comments.
[313:50.82]That's not even true though.
[313:53.26]How many things have I said this stream that we're just responding to questions?
[314:00.92]What do you mean I'm just responding to questions and comments people have?
[314:14.97]Alright, I gotta get out of here soon.
[314:17.49]I'm at 472.
[314:24.81]That's a sword.
[314:26.61]Goldol's... Goldol's sword?
[314:28.93]Can I put items on in this game?
[314:34.66]What do I do with that?
[314:35.38]Maybe I can just sell it?
[314:49.51]How fast can I dab?
[314:53.67]I don't know, I haven't tracked it.
[314:55.11]I don't have like a radar gun to track how fast my dabs are.
[314:58.43]If I'm going to take a guess though, I would say probably like, probably like 600, like probably 60 or 50, 60 to 50 miles per hour.
[315:13.69]If I had a radar gun pointed at me.
[315:17.48]Look at this guy.
[315:19.44]Whoa.
[315:22.74]I kind of want this Praying Mantis person.
[315:29.98]He probably has a ton of speed.
[315:37.19]Sit down.
[315:40.97]Just measure it in DPS.
[315:41.95]Dabs.
[315:42.27]DPM.
[315:42.65]Dabs per minute.
[315:55.17]You think that's ever gonna go away?
[315:56.32]You think anyone's ever gonna stop dabbing?
[315:58.00]You think that's... when is that gonna transition out?
[316:08.46]It's... it has to be... soon, right?
[316:13.14]Okay, level three.
[316:14.91]Roberto obtained Super Weapon.
[316:16.85]Vroomer obtained Sniper.
[316:19.95]Roberto mastered Swing.
[316:21.77]Okay, finally we can swing the sword.
[316:30.62]Yeah, I ain't gonna lie.
[316:31.32]Look at Roberto's stats.
[316:32.48]They're actually getting pretty good.
[316:34.78]Okay, let's go into this area here.
[316:40.24]There it is.
[316:40.76]Swing.
[316:42.46]Life Damage, C. Accuracy Rating, S. This thing will never miss.
[316:47.00]Exactly what I need.
[316:52.50]He just became the character we're gonna be playing with.
[316:54.90]So that takes over for Kick.
[317:00.12]He's got something else too, right?
[317:01.49]Super weapon.
[317:03.89]Increases power of moves that use the weapon.
[317:07.09]Nice.
[317:09.67]And then what did I get for... I got something else.
[317:14.26]There's a rumor, right?
[317:21.48]Sniper.
[317:23.34]Throwing and shooting.
[317:24.62]What counts as that for here?
[317:26.99]Does the backdash count as a throw?
[317:33.98]Charge, backspin, with type, far range.
[317:36.32]Is this a throw?
[317:39.43]This is probably a throw, right?
[317:40.41]I do assume.
[317:49.83]Cool, alright.
[317:50.37]Well, now they're getting a lot better.
[317:53.29]Just kind of had to do this.
[318:03.69]Oh shit, what is this?
[318:07.72]In the cutscene here.
[318:09.74]What was my last toaster strudel I ate?
[318:11.32]I don't eat toaster strudels.
[318:14.89]I buy the box, and you know how the icing is all kind of attached, connected, almost like they're on a string together?
[318:22.07]Well, I take a pair of scissors, and at the very top of the icing, there's a little nub that you're supposed to squeeze the icing out of.
[318:29.82]So I take a pair of scissors, and I cut across every single part of the strand of icing packets.
[318:35.96]So they're all cut off at the top of the nub.
[318:38.68]And then it's about, I think it's eight packets that are connected.
[318:42.35]I fold them all on top of each other,
[318:44.81]Turn it upside down, squeeze all eight packets at the same time, and just DERAIN the icing.
[318:51.13]All eight packages.
[318:52.89]And then I throw the box in the trash.
[318:57.98]What, that's not- is that not normal?
[319:09.86]There's something about this, it's strange.
[319:11.34]My old friend, can you hear me?
[319:14.37]Hello, old friend.
[319:16.43]Who is that?
[319:18.39]Much time has passed since your former adventure.
[319:21.25]But it seems the world needs you once again.
[319:24.10]What's happening?
[319:24.68]Who am I?
[319:25.88]Where are you?
[319:27.62]Now I am a stone fragment formed in the lands of Gaia.
[319:31.24]A Gaia stone, if you will.
[319:34.18]You will understand all soon enough.
[319:37.72]What's up, Ryo?
[319:38.72]What a beautiful stone.
[319:39.69]Yes.
[319:41.33]Yes.
[319:42.45]I'm gonna take it with me.
[319:44.35]Eek.
[319:52.44]What the fuck was that?
[319:54.82]Rio, what happened?
[319:57.18]I'm okay, sorry.
[319:58.66]Rio, let's go home.
[320:00.84]Yeah, let's go home.
[320:05.26]That was really fucked up.
[320:14.07]She's having a mental breakdown.
[320:16.87]She touched the magic stone and she started hearing voices.
[320:20.53]It started to implant itself in her brain.
[320:28.25]Hey, Fane!
[320:29.11]Fane!
[320:29.37]I thought that actually was music, but it's not.
[320:31.03]I forgot.
[320:33.42]Pollock, you look awfully excited!
[320:34.64]What's going on?
[320:36.26]Are your training gadgets working alright?
[320:39.16]What?
[320:39.56]Why wouldn't they be?
[320:41.53]There's a Geonite shortage in these parts.
[320:43.81]Gadget stopped working on all the ranches.
[320:48.45]We seem to be doing fine.
[320:51.16]Well, thank goodness.
[320:53.08]But most of the ranches can't train their monsters.
[320:55.74]Official competition may be canceled for the time being.
[321:01.40]What?
[321:07.64]Don't worry, I'm going to look into this.
[321:09.14]Bye then.
[321:10.73]I can't do any more competitions.
[321:16.97]Now that he mentions it, I have noticed my body feeling a bit strange lately.
[321:22.58]But I'm no run-of-the-mill spirit tree.
[321:24.72]I'm tough.
[321:26.58]I think you're the only spirit tree, to be honest.
[321:28.98]Will it be okay?
[321:30.76]I wonder if the training gadgets used too much Geonite.
[321:34.90]No, it's not exactly that.
[321:36.94]It's like the Geonite is being sucked down through my roots.
[321:41.72]Your roots?
[321:43.46]We can use the cave to check underneath here.
[321:45.74]Let's do a little exploration.
[321:48.05]Sounds good.
[321:48.75]I just did that, though.
[321:51.73]Don't they need to rest?
[321:59.06]Uh, wait.
[321:59.40]Check the fan art.
[322:00.10]What are you talking about?
[322:05.06]Fridge pissing.
[322:05.74]What are you guys linking here?
[322:15.25]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[322:16.45]I'm trying to click it.
[322:17.33]Is it a comic book?
[322:21.41]Oh, Intelligence 482.
[322:23.87]With my vast intellect, I have analyzed all possible futures.
[322:26.85]You have no chance of victory.
[322:29.66]KO.
[322:35.04]A whole comic book!
[322:37.46]Holy shit, that was fast!
[322:39.66]You made a whole comic book.
[322:43.48]This is funny.
[322:45.26]That's true, though.
[322:45.86]What the hell would you... That was the weirdest monster.
[322:49.42]I feel like the game broke.
[322:54.52]Here, I'll show it.
[323:04.56]No, that's not what I want.
[323:24.40]There you go, see?
[323:36.13]482.
[323:38.35]I want to try that with a monster.
[323:39.85]You know what?
[323:41.97]Not today, but on the next stream.
[323:47.18]On the next stream, I want to completely design a monster around only having
[323:52.73]Only speed and only accuracy.
[323:56.33]So you could just spam a shitty move and hit it every time.
[324:00.27]And then who cares?
[324:07.63]But that was from Drosophilia.
[324:09.09]Thank you, Drosophilia.
[324:20.69]It's a new day on the East Coast.
[324:23.87]Yeah, it is technically a new day.
[324:26.48]Nah, I'm not done streaming now.
[324:27.58]What are we talking about?
[324:29.08]We're still going.
[324:31.08]I'll go for like another hour or two.
[324:36.82]It's April 1st!
[324:38.14]That means that's- I'm just kidding, stream ends in like 10 minutes.
[324:46.16]Alright, what we got for- We need to go into the- There's no training allowed, right?
[324:51.05]Everyone's tired.
[324:52.85]Rest.
[324:56.91]Everybody go to bed.
[324:57.71]Back it up.
[325:01.76]And then after this, we're going to go into the cave again, because we have scripted cave content.
[325:14.52]And also, by the way, for those of you that are curious, I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[325:20.60]I came back for one day here.
[325:23.87]Because this has been Kim's birthday weekend.
[325:31.53]And there's some stuff that I want to do.
[325:34.68]We went out already, but tomorrow I want to take her somewhere else.
[325:41.86]It's not an April Fool's joke, that's for real.
[325:45.02]It's not April Fool's, I promise you.
[325:49.01]Don't you guys know why April Fool's jokes and joke streams don't even happen on April 1st?
[325:53.91]They happen on like April 11th.
[326:03.09]Good luck.
[326:05.41]April Fool's proposal.
[326:09.94]No, this is Kim's birthday weekend.
[326:14.10]And as you know, you celebrate the whole week when it's somebody's birthday, not just a day.
[326:27.26]Stream the date.
[326:28.88]I don't think so.
[326:30.89]But, uh, I just want to make that clear.
[326:33.39]And I'll be back.
[326:36.25]We'll go April 2nd, April 3rd, and probably April 4th.
[326:42.05]And then we'll see what we're doing.
[326:51.18]We'll do another three days in a row.
[326:55.10]After tomorrow.
[327:01.69]But now, where are we going now?
[327:07.37]Everybody's all rested?
[327:08.85]Anybody hungry?
[327:09.35]Because we have to go and do the scripted thing.
[327:13.95]You were hungry, you have a potato.
[327:24.93]Can't wait for the quick stream clip of Jerma throwing a pie in Kim's face for April Fools.
[327:31.42]No.
[327:37.12]Like a ten second stream, that'd be so bad.
[327:40.91]Alright, adventure, let's go.
[327:46.73]Thousand energy this time.
[328:02.99]So we have to go under the tree.
[328:08.58]Every day is my birthday.
[328:09.92]Every single day.
[328:30.10]The bats are really annoying.
[328:31.10]Yeah, they really are.
[328:31.76]They kind of just don't do anything.
[328:33.06]Just fly around.
[328:33.72]Nobody can get in here.
[328:38.05]Rumor cannot help you investigate.
[328:39.51]No, you can't.
[328:50.29]So what?
[328:50.87]Floor 3?
[328:51.11]Floor 4?
[328:55.72]Everyone expects me to read that.
[328:58.40]But I'm not going to.
[328:59.60]Because I'm going to try to break from the habit, apparently, if I look over and read the weird, gross thing that somebody wrote.
[329:05.86]Not tonight.
[329:10.03]I was about to read it out loud.
[329:13.33]I'm starting to learn.
[329:14.13]I'm starting to figure out how to be a streamer.
[329:15.97]Alright, let's try this new move.
[329:20.59]Let's get a...
[329:22.74]Let's get Roberto in here.
[329:23.78]So this is... Swing.
[329:26.72]What's the chance on it?
[329:28.68]76%.
[329:28.86]That's a pretty great move.
[329:34.80]Is it weird that I want to... turn this into the main character?
[329:38.99]I feel like stat-wise... Alright, that's back-to-back.
[329:51.19]Let's go.
[330:02.21]Nobody else got any moves, right?
[330:06.25]Stop being so timid.
[330:11.02]89 damage.
[330:12.46]Overkill.
[330:17.22]Roberto is the protagonist.
[330:18.86]Vroomer is the funny sidekick.
[330:20.60]That's true.
[330:23.32]That's actually a really good point.
[330:31.45]Document 7.
[330:36.18]Let's actually... Let's get Wall-E up here and level up Wall-E to level 3.
[330:41.92]And Wall-E is the cute pet, yeah.
[330:55.34]Wall-E is the cute pet that doesn't do anything for the whole series, but like two times over the course of 400 episodes will save everybody for some reason.
[331:07.61]Come on, I got extra damage on this, right?
[331:17.83]Really?
[331:21.47]Not bad.
[331:22.61]Not very good either.
[331:28.81]More damage on my ranged attacks.
[331:34.36]Team up.
[331:35.00]Except that thing sucks.
[331:38.20]I think I need more intelligence, that's why it's not dealing any damage.
[331:45.39]Alright, can we... You have to get the last hit, but you're really making this hard.
[331:59.51]The baby, walnut baby has to get last hit.
[332:04.41]Or walnut, or Wally might just die.
[332:06.41]Wally's gonna die.
[332:08.01]Alright, pull him out.
[332:10.21]Sometimes you gotta know when to fold.
[332:22.67]The Labo VR comes out on April 12th.
[332:24.95]I can't wait.
[332:30.44]Obtained a Nunchaku.
[332:39.00]I cannot wait to do Labo VR.
[332:42.80]I'm gonna lose like 10,000 followers and like 1,500 people gonna unsub.
[332:48.98]I have to do it though.
[332:50.76]I have to.
[333:03.48]Not gonna be able to stream it though, we can't see the screen.
[333:07.57]I'll find a way.
[333:10.75]You guys can just do it.
[333:12.61]I'll put the webcam inside of the machine and let you guys do it.
[333:29.12]Irma's gonna go on a Labo Cardboard VR date with Kim.
[333:47.55]Alright, level up.
[333:53.91]Burn all your old Labo shit.
[333:55.89]I don't even have it anymore.
[333:59.19]Suico E. Alright, give me a last hit.
[334:06.29]You only have 43 health.
[334:15.28]Do it!
[334:19.50]29%.
[334:19.64]This is not going to hit.
[334:22.99]35%.
[334:23.13]I could have burnt it for content.
[334:30.49]No, that's dangerous.
[334:33.33]I may have gotten injured during that.
[334:44.23]What a lame streamer.
[334:45.43]10% chance to hit.
[334:46.45]I may as well just stay back here forever.
[334:51.10]But that would be some content.
[334:57.00]Wall-E, you're really kind of pissing me off here.
[335:11.46]You guys don't want to see that.
[335:12.52]That's not, like, no.
[335:19.48]I don't think it's time to Freezer Wally yet.
[335:22.12]Not yet.
[335:26.47]Finally.
[335:28.01]What?
[335:35.57]He was so irritated.
[335:36.57]He was just like, Jesus Christ!
[335:41.42]I'll take care of this!
[335:42.34]Alright, fine.
[335:46.34]Level 3.
[335:47.42]Wally obtained King's Fist.
[335:50.13]And mastered Magic Hand.
[335:53.45]And obtained Reference.
[336:00.69]Magic Hand.
[336:02.43]Short range.
[336:05.17]Finally a move that has accuracy.
[336:09.34]And it's short range.
[336:10.34]This is perfect, okay.
[336:12.28]I gotta start building intelligence.
[336:14.14]What does Molly even have for stats?
[336:15.74]Well, that's actually not that bad.
[336:23.42]Pretty good, actually.
[336:24.12]Alright, what else did you just learn?
[336:29.36]King's Fist.
[336:31.79]Chris's power moves that use the fists.
[336:34.37]Alright, well...
[336:41.57]What smell do you think of when you picture the color aquamarine?
[336:45.89]Um, a blue popsicle.
[336:49.61]You know what I'm talking about.
[336:52.83]Got an amethyst.
[337:01.80]Cool.
[337:07.24]The smell of a blue popsicle.
[337:19.50]I'm sorry, guys.
[337:20.22]You have to do it.
[337:22.56]The blue... The, like, electric blue raspberry popsicle.
[337:26.48]Smell it.
[337:31.59]Oh, man.
[337:32.43]I can't get him with the comedy move.
[337:36.83]It's a double hit.
[337:38.89]What's a 60%?
[337:52.29]So, Artificial Blueberry, yes.
[337:54.01]Alright, let's get the guy that actually can hurt things out here, please.
[338:01.86]No, that's not good.
[338:07.08]Really?
[338:13.45]82.
[338:14.35]I'm taking this guy to the top.
[338:24.59]Can I get Roberto a level 4 before this is all done?
[338:30.13]Can you throw Wall-E off a rooftop?
[338:32.51]Even if I did, it wouldn't be a problem.
[338:34.41]He would just close into his wall nutshell and would be fine.
[338:43.60]Wall-E's gonna be a slow burn.
[338:49.45]Why did you have to just write that?
[338:50.37]I just made some salsa.
[338:51.23]Do you want some?
[338:52.01]Why'd you write that?
[338:52.73]Now I want some.
[338:54.28]I actually do want that now.
[339:10.03]87.
[339:10.13]Awww.
[339:11.93]Ended with another one.
[339:14.65]Actually, now I can bring out... No, I'll just...
[339:28.56]What kind of salsa though?
[339:29.50]There's a lot of different kinds.
[339:32.14]Are we talking like a peach salsa?
[339:34.02]A mango salsa?
[339:35.10]Raspberry salsa?
[339:37.06]Black bean salsa?
[339:38.01]Maybe a little bit of queso on the side?
[339:40.85]I want this so bad.
[339:41.83]I'll see you later, I'm leaving.
[339:51.62]I'll see you guys in like a month.
[339:53.68]What if I stopped streaming for a month?
[340:05.95]You already did that.
[340:06.79]Yeah, I know.
[340:08.67]Like before.
[340:09.31]Yeah, just- no, not just to eat salsa.
[340:12.13]I'm just- this is kind of just- we're just hanging out.
[340:16.83]Yeah, sorry guys.
[340:17.59]I'll see you guys in a month.
[340:19.15]I'm just gonna- I'm gonna eat salsa.
[340:20.45]I'm gonna be a salsa review channel on YouTube.
[340:33.23]Well, to be fair, the reason why I stopped streaming for a month is because I was traveling across the whole country in an inflated air car.
[340:41.43]Alright, let's go Roberto.
[340:44.53]Mastered cut in two!
[340:50.40]Yeah, I think Roberto's gonna be the one that takes us to the top here.
[340:54.20]This is short, swing, mid-range.
[340:59.86]Cut in two.
[341:01.72]Holy shit, look at that damage.
[341:04.51]An A for damage.
[341:06.07]Terrible accuracy.
[341:09.31]But... That's pretty amazing.
[341:14.29]I wonder how much damage that actually does.
[341:17.87]We'll find out.
[341:31.41]Alright, let's pull it out.
[341:32.01]Let's see what happens.
[341:33.81]Alright.
[341:34.43]Cut in two.
[341:38.54]The regular slash does, like, 90 damage.
[341:40.54]I wonder how much this does.
[341:45.14]Alright, come on.
[341:45.62]Let's go.
[341:47.62]I can't... He's right up on me, huh?
[341:50.96]Alright, fine.
[341:51.48]I guess... Alright.
[341:53.26]Alright, alright.
[341:53.89]It's time.
[341:54.25]Let me just kill this motherfucker.
[341:57.61]Alright.
[341:58.37]Bounce.
[341:59.21]Bounce it back.
[342:00.59]Cut in two.
[342:08.74]Less damage than the other one.
[342:14.41]Thoughts on recent politics?
[342:15.57]Yeah, sure.
[342:16.11]Fuck.
[342:16.97]Fuck.
[342:19.87]That, this, and that, and that.
[342:30.36]I think I have to make it to the fourth floor here.
[342:44.27]Floor 3, this is where we found the little tablet.
[342:46.15]What did I have to eat today?
[343:00.06]Two eggs.
[343:03.30]Some orange juice.
[343:07.55]And a bowl of Lucky Charms.
[343:11.43]But I take out all the, uh, actual cereal parts and I only eat the Marshmallow.
[343:19.31]Takes a long time, but I do it.
[343:26.08]I just put them, like, back in the box.
[343:28.56]So it's like, as if when I'm pouring it, it's like its own cereal.
[343:38.23]Troron.
[343:39.47]You might as well just eat spoonfuls of sugar.
[343:42.57]You actually... Hold on.
[343:43.01]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[343:43.73]I want to show you.
[345:35.60]It's actually really hard to do this.
[345:41.71]So... Lucky Charms.
[345:47.25]It's hard to put a lot of milk on these, though.
[345:48.73]No, it's good.
[346:02.91]Social Eating.
[346:05.15]I love Lucky Charms.
[346:12.97]You guys thought I was making that up.
[346:14.06]I do this.
[346:25.33]I've been doing it since I was like 11.
[346:34.60]Too much- you have to put the milk at the bottom?
[346:36.30]Because too much milk... Too much milk will cause... The sogginess of these marshmallows really gets bad after about 30 seconds.
[346:51.41]Why is everybody making fun of me?
[346:53.35]How weird shit do you do?
[346:59.69]What weird shit do you do?
[347:16.53]Yeah, what fucked up shit do you do?
[347:24.24]Tell me I don't fucking do that.
[347:25.54]Somebody called me a liar.
[347:36.20]I put ketchup on my sandwiches.
[347:37.52]That's fucking weird.
[347:47.81]How long does it take to do?
[347:50.31]Well, I buy like 15 boxes.
[347:52.07]Because it really... 10 to 15 boxes makes one box of marshmallows.
[347:59.12]And I throw the rest in the trash.
[348:26.61]I don't know why this is so weird.
[348:31.43]April Fools- It's 9.50 PM, March 31st.
[348:34.91]April Fools.
[348:35.43]What are you talking about?
[348:44.84]This is where your money goes, chat.
[348:53.26]Rumor mastered bang drum.
[349:01.67]It's not an April Fool's joke.
[349:03.59]I just have this.
[349:11.88]One sub is one box.
[349:24.41]Somebody's really concerned.
[349:25.63]Why would you waste money on brand name cereal and throw it away?
[349:40.84]That's not- just- it's alright.
[349:44.52]What a monster.
[349:56.52]How long does it take you to filter a whole box out?
[350:01.65]A long time!
[350:12.04]This is like burning my mouth.
[350:15.80]Alright, uh, we got... What did I just got?
[350:18.10]What happened?
[350:21.88]It was Wall-E, right?
[350:26.30]No, who leveled up?
[350:27.08]Rumor?
[350:27.97]Yeah, there we go.
[350:32.77]Okay, right there.
[350:39.86]Bang drum, life damage E, accuracy rate D. So addled.
[350:48.17]Okay.
[350:54.71]Does your dentist know you do this?
[350:56.35]He actually encourages it.
[350:59.65]In his way, he said, if you just eat like sugary cereals every day, you'll be more inclined to want to brush your teeth.
[351:08.22]You're supposed to brush your teeth twice a day.
[351:09.72]If you eat, like, Lucky Charms only, the marshmallow parts, he said, for at least breakfast and dinner, you'll have to brush your teeth.
[351:18.73]Because last time I went to the dentist, I hadn't brushed my teeth in about two years.
[351:22.65]And this is all, these are all fake.
[351:24.24]All these teeth are fake.
[351:52.35]I hate this bit.
[351:56.09]Do you though?
[351:56.59]Are you sure?
[352:04.46]Water!
[352:04.76]Can I go in there?
[352:13.65]You're a bad influence on your child viewers.
[352:15.59]Please take responsibility and brush your teeth on stream.
[352:29.69]No, that's gross.
[352:30.45]That's weird.
[352:32.81]Child viewers.
[352:33.81]Alright, when you say... How old do you think people are watching this channel?
[352:40.86]How old do you think they are?
[352:52.60]Like, four?
[352:56.98]Alright, speaking of four, we're going to the fourth floor.
[353:05.00]By the way, if you've ever had astronaut ice cream, it is just Lucky Charms marshmallows.
[353:12.46]Gigantic ones.
[353:14.89]Space ice cream?
[353:15.61]If you're one of those people that loves to eat freeze-dried marshmallow, like I do with me.
[353:20.81]I got a whole bowl of it over here.
[353:28.08]Yeah, and it's fucking garbage.
[353:29.84]Whoa.
[353:30.10]Relax.
[353:40.42]This freeze-dried stuff is way too chalky.
[353:44.94]I mean, if you eat chalk... Alright, I'm gonna stop because people are gonna think this is like, real.
[354:01.91]I really don't want to end up somewhere where people think that like, holy shit, he's like fucking insane.
[354:12.50]These are kind of good though.
[354:28.11]This haha dentist and cereal joke.
[354:40.82]I can't do anything.
[354:45.52]I just dry heaved because I heard him eating it.
[354:47.74]It's not like dog poo.
[354:50.30]It's marshmallow.
[354:53.42]You act like I'm eating a bowl of paint.
[354:57.18]Or like somebody else's throw up.
[354:58.98]What?
[354:59.70]It's freeze-dried marshmallow.
[355:03.09]What's wrong?
[355:04.93]What's the problem?
[355:12.30]Like, I'm not eating blended up cold hot dogs with a spoon.
[355:35.51]Finally, I can swing!
[355:42.13]I would pay you to do that.
[355:52.56]I'm not gonna do that.
[355:57.60]I would never do something like that.
[356:05.19]You disgust me, you serial serial filter!
[356:11.00]No, you wanna know actually the best cereal that I've ever had was?
[356:16.76]Original Cookie Crisp.
[356:24.60]I'm not talking about Cookie Crisp now.
[356:29.90]Back when it was made with animal fat, whatever the hell it was.
[356:32.18]It was great.
[356:44.88]Stop it!
[356:45.34]Let me do something.
[356:48.00]I can't even do anything.
[356:48.94]He's just doing E over and over again.
[356:56.18]Cookie Crisp now is not very good.
[357:04.66]He's gonna block.
[357:05.34]Alright, bring in the real.
[357:07.74]Bring in the real one here, please.
[357:09.64]Is he... is he dead?
[357:10.76]I wasn't even paying attention.
[357:12.82]Did he get killed?
[357:22.31]Please do something.
[357:24.63]Oh my god.
[357:28.36]If I die to this, I'm gonna be so angry.
[357:42.17]No.
[357:45.01]Oh my god.
[357:47.17]Finally.
[357:47.63]Alright, big money came in.
[357:51.48]Thank you, Kairatobi, for the 50 bucks.
[357:54.44]5000 bits.
[357:55.30]This is for the Marshmallow Fund, you 4-2 leprechaun.
[358:10.27]Boomerang!
[358:24.03]I don't even want these.
[358:24.83]Let me put them back in the box.
[358:30.57]I don't want any more of this comedy cereal.
[358:45.98]You're watching Boomerang.
[358:47.50]It's all coming back to you.
[358:59.45]What would your own cereal be?
[359:02.81]Something light.
[359:04.15]You know, like Pops.
[359:08.83]It'd be something like Pops.
[359:11.03]But with a lighter coating.
[359:13.93]Not as sugary.
[359:19.86]Me?
[359:20.06]Because of Roberto?
[359:23.06]I'm not gonna get the cuts in here.
[359:33.90]I have a fucking stomach ache now.
[359:49.37]And whose fault is that?
[359:50.29]Jex Mix.
[359:50.79]Is there bacteria in these?
[359:54.65]Somebody look it up.
[360:01.61]Are there... is that bacteria in... freeze-dried marshmallows?
[360:20.75]There's bacteria in everything.
[360:28.25]This is true.
[360:39.17]You guys know that according to doctors, humans should not be taking in more than 32 grams of sugar or 36 grams of sugar a day of added sugars.
[360:54.88]That is like a whole day.
[360:57.36]Do not consume more than 38 grams of added sugar a day.
[361:02.86]Right?
[361:04.34]You know how much sugar is in a can of Coke?
[361:10.45]39 grams.
[361:10.95]You know how much is in Mountain Dew?
[361:20.47]Throwback?
[361:22.31]44.
[361:30.29]I've said the same shit before.
[361:31.46]Yeah, well, there's probably a bunch of new people here.
[361:35.26]It's 42 grams of sugar, buddy.
[361:37.18]Oh, I don't think so.
[361:37.92]Look it up.
[361:39.32]Add a trigger a day for a male is like 38.
[361:42.47]For a female, I believe it's like 30.
[361:43.87]That's what it says.
[361:46.31]Look it up.
[361:52.86]Why do I know this?
[361:53.58]Because my dentist told me to.
[362:06.14]Alright, so we can't even figure this out.
[362:07.72]How much sugar is in one Lucky Charm Marshmallow?
[362:12.78]Do we know how many grams of sugar is in one?
[362:27.39]Level 5 for Vroomer.
[362:30.63]What's going on?
[362:31.43]Nothing?
[362:31.79]Nothing new at level 5?
[362:39.22]0.25 grams, I googled it.
[362:41.82]There you go.
[362:47.44]But just weigh it on a scale, that's all it is.
[362:59.05]My back hurts now.
[363:01.57]What's with this fucking bacteria marshmallow shit that I just ate?
[363:13.82]Alright, am I almost there?
[363:14.72]Sugar is reverse salt.
[363:24.35]Didn't we have to go underneath the tree?
[363:39.13]How many marshmallows do we eat at a time?
[363:40.41]Oh, there's probably like three or four hundred in here.
[363:54.35]Can't believe you guys fell for the oldest April Fool's joke in the book.
[363:58.30]Guy eats bowl of ma- marshmallows.
[364:00.74]Somebody says, we didn't.
[364:12.50]Oh yeah, the classic April Fool's joke.
[364:21.97]This thing looks pretty dangerous.
[364:43.96]jokes on us he just painted wood chips to look like marshmallows yeah this is like this is clay you guys didn't even know alright get me to the tree before they all die oh my god what the hell play-doh unironically tastes good
[365:12.96]Well, you should unironically probably stop doing that.
[365:15.78]It's really not fun.
[365:17.66]It's not good for you.
[365:33.69]Plato is vegan.
[365:38.51]Yeah, and...
[365:41.19]So is the plastic on my keyboard, but I'm not gonna pop off buttons and swallow them.
[365:57.23]You know how much sugar is in Play-Doh?
[365:58.91]Way too much.
[366:10.53]Buy a keyboard made out of chocolate and eat it on the end of a stream.
[366:15.07]That is actually kind of funny.
[366:19.85]Whoa!
[366:20.27]This is a weird looking monster.
[366:30.63]Let's shoot him.
[366:36.64]Oh no, let's just run into him.
[366:44.70]Play-Doh isn't gluten-free.
[366:49.00]Guys, you're not supposed to be eating Play-Doh.
[366:51.78]Who cares what the nutritional content is?
[367:01.11]It doesn't matter if Play-Doh is gluten-free or sugar-free or it's low sodium.
[367:14.91]Don't tell me what to do.
[367:19.53]Yeah, fine.
[367:19.93]Don't tell me what to do.
[367:25.20]If I were to eat my comedy cereal, I'm going to eat it.
[367:32.36]You're not our dad.
[367:33.02]You're not my dad.
[367:37.37]Alright, I got it.
[367:51.59]What the hell?
[367:56.13]Uh... Did I just stumble upon a boss?
[368:02.27]Rah!
[368:03.99]Whoa, is he angry?
[368:06.15]No, no, he's talking to us.
[368:08.06]Please, Fane, leave this to me.
[368:10.62]Are you the one using the Geonite around here?
[368:12.64]I've lived off Geonite for ages, rah!
[368:17.26]But why have you suddenly started using so much Geonite?
[368:21.77]The increased flow of Geonite woke me up.
[368:24.43]Now I need lots of Geonite to stay awake.
[368:27.83]But you're causing people a lot of trouble.
[368:29.19]Please sleep once again.
[368:30.23]Go back to bed.
[368:31.84]Rawr!
[368:32.58]Never!
[368:34.52]Watch out!
[368:35.16]Get back!
[368:39.08]Too much G-Fuel.
[368:47.92]Um...
[368:51.92]Okay.
[368:58.98]That was a good hit.
[369:02.78]King Shigen.
[369:11.31]Shit.
[369:15.91]Back it up.
[369:16.91]Do it again.
[369:17.29]See.
[369:17.43]Come on.
[369:17.63]37%.
[369:17.65]Get it.
[369:17.85]Damn it.
[369:25.08]Good block.
[369:30.36]Damn it.
[369:37.17]Come on, you have 96 guts.
[369:38.77]Make this work.
[369:39.83]Oh, dude.
[369:42.37]Guts down.
[369:42.85]Slow.
[369:42.99]He's gonna get killed.
[369:47.97]137 damage.
[369:48.19]Alright, it's all up to you.
[369:54.29]You still can't hit it.
[370:01.04]What?
[370:01.34]You alright?
[370:05.32]Charge.
[370:07.20]Get in there.
[370:07.84]Alright, one more of those.
[370:13.15]That's it.
[370:13.81]Come on, Froomer.
[370:15.17]44% chance.
[370:15.59]Get it.
[370:16.49]Yes, I win.
[370:23.35]Only if Rumor gets the EXP, unfortunately.
[370:26.82]High speed ride!
[370:28.94]And mastered 0 to 60.
[370:30.34]Nice.
[370:32.40]You just killed an old god.
[370:45.23]Oh.
[370:45.93]Alright.
[370:48.74]I'm so sorry.
[370:50.08]But please understand, we need Geonite.
[370:52.31]Therefore, you have to die.
[370:53.65]Humans using Geonite.
[370:57.25]Times have changed.
[370:59.71]Young princess, it's been a long time.
[371:01.49]I'll be good for your sake.
[371:04.23]What?
[371:05.54]How do you know about me?
[371:07.44]Yes, we Raiden are your friends.
[371:10.62]What do you mean?
[371:11.18]Tell me.
[371:16.50]Shoot, he's asleep.
[371:18.27]But at least now the flow of Geonite will return to normal.
[371:21.97]Look near his feet.
[371:25.23]Hmm, a huge pair of wings.
[371:27.48]Are these his wings?
[371:29.84]He said they're our friends.
[371:30.98]Maybe these wings are to prove that.
[371:36.20]The Great Raiden are our friends.
[371:38.52]Awesome, let's go back to the ranch.
[371:51.46]Who made this game?
[371:54.00]Um... Who the fuck did... Capcom, right?
[371:59.01]Wally was injured.
[371:59.95]I'll send it to the hospital.
[372:01.03]Uh-oh.
[372:06.27]Wally hasn't gotten better yet.
[372:07.95]I sure hope it comes back soon.
[372:09.51]Is anybody home?
[372:17.46]Yes.
[372:17.80]Oh, Cynthia.
[372:18.98]Today I've come with a delivery.
[372:21.81]A breeder ranking card.
[372:23.79]We've earned rank D. Yep, your efforts have earned an official ranking.
[372:28.55]Congratulations.
[372:30.53]Thank you very much.
[372:32.17]And also, with the Geonite shortage finally solved, official battles will finally be starting again.

[372:39.64]Do your best.
[372:41.22]Yes, yes we will.
[372:43.02]We'll do our very best.
[372:53.33]Where's Wally?
[373:03.79]Is he dead for real?
[373:12.46]Okay.
[373:13.24]Calendar?
[373:14.16]Alright.

[373:52.88]Roberto needs, um, accuracy.
[373:57.10]Accuracy and life.
[373:59.06]Rumor needs life and... Either life, probably life and defense.
[374:08.87]Let's get you in the tub.
[374:15.17]And...

[375:00.03]I mean, it's just the truth.
[375:18.58]Ah, here, have some food.
[375:22.37]Have a banana.
[375:26.77]Wally was good when he pierced shields.
[375:28.17]Yeah, that's true.
[375:33.39]But these two are way better.
[375:34.91]Alright, hold on.
[375:41.60]Silver coin.
[375:42.50]I have so much of this stuff.
[375:46.28]You want some cards?
[375:49.28]I think Roberto hates battle cards.
[375:50.98]It says, I don't want it.
[375:54.98]Yeah, right.
[375:56.46]That's a nice cover.
[375:57.98]You have every pack.
[375:59.11]Alright, let's get back out here.
[376:06.35]Uh...
[376:11.50]Check out Rumor's new- I thought for some reason, I don't know why I said that, I thought it said emote.
[376:15.93]Check out Rumor's new emote.
[376:17.97]I was like, what does that mean?
[376:25.93]What condiment would I choose if I had to drink a liter of it in one sitting?
[376:32.92]Uh... Probably like A1 steak sauce.
[376:37.56]I feel like that wouldn't be that hard.
[376:44.87]Let's go to the shrine.
[376:58.92]Wally never came back.
[377:00.60]Therefore, we're replacing him.
[377:04.45]No.
[377:06.33]We can't.
[377:07.51]I can't do anything.
[377:10.59]Wally is in the hospital, but he still counts as a slot.
[377:22.63]Freeze him in the hospital.
[377:27.23]I don't think I can even do that.
[377:35.70]Unplug him.
[377:37.12]You guys are brutal.
[377:39.04]Okay, training.
[377:41.72]What's the schedule look like?
[377:44.36]Uh, you have a tournament tomorrow, so you're gonna do Lightblade tonight, and you're gonna rest tomorrow.
[377:49.29]You have a tournament later on in the week, so you're gonna do Tub, and then you're gonna rest.
[377:55.63]Get in.
[377:56.43]Alright, you have to eat.
[378:07.34]Oh, fuck, I'm almost out of food.
[378:12.36]I am out of food.
[378:17.28]What happened to Wally?
[378:18.33]Probably dead.
[378:20.31]There's a possibility that Wally is dead.
[378:32.07]He's been gone for a long time.
[378:36.41]You don't have to eat right now.
[378:43.42]I'm going to buy some stuff.
[378:50.40]Rush Wally in a hydraulic press.
[378:56.14]I swear.
[378:56.70]Some of you guys have lost your minds.
[379:02.53]What?
[379:03.45]Why?
[379:03.83]Let's get, like, five bananas.
[379:09.19]Shitload of potatoes.
[379:09.96]Okay.
[379:12.20]I'm gonna save my money.
[379:23.21]Let's sell.
[379:25.63]I have some new items here.
[379:28.41]990 gold.
[379:32.09]Yarn ball, battle cards, silver coin, amethyst.
[379:35.73]These are all worth- I should just sell all this shit.
[379:37.87]I don't think I need it for anything.
[379:49.36]Turn Wally into a condiment and drink a gallon of it.
[379:56.00]I'm gonna tell your mother that you said that.
[380:08.51]Slashman21's mom?
[380:13.33]You see what your fucking son just wrote?
[380:20.73]We all live in the same house.
[380:44.34]So, sleep, rest, and you are also going to rest.
[380:49.72]And then tonight... Oh!
[380:51.64]Look who's back!
[380:54.90]You made it back.
[380:57.73]Welcome back.
[381:05.61]Chip him off to the glue factory.
[381:14.15]You guys are terrible.
[381:14.91]Alright, everyone's fine.
[381:20.63]Let's get Roberto into the competition.
[381:26.44]I want to get him up.
[381:27.30]He's got to rank the fuck up, man.
[381:43.31]look on the next stream the next time you play this this is an audition because whoever is the best pretty much at the end of this stream is the one that gets to move on
[382:11.59]What just happened?
[382:20.13]Why did that... I couldn't... What?
[382:27.66]He gave up.
[382:29.96]He saw the Wolf Gundam suit and he quit.
[382:32.44]Why?
[382:32.70]Alright, Decker.
[382:42.97]117 damage.
[382:43.93]You ain't got shit.
[382:46.75]I feel like this is the guy that will get to S rank.
[382:49.97]Super easily.
[383:02.50]It was that easy.
[383:07.92]Yeah, I bullied a bunch of rank E's.
[383:10.22]I did it.
[383:15.82]800 bucks and a banana.
[383:26.67]You guys are fucking sadistic.
[383:28.11]Somebody just said something fucking horrible.
[383:38.39]Okay, what we got?
[383:40.83]Begin training?
[383:41.29]Not yet.
[383:42.15]So somebody else has a...
[383:46.54]You have the final... Is this the right... Hold on, let me see.
[383:50.30]What's the calendar look like?
[383:54.15]So you got this is the last... No, where is it?
[383:59.45]Okay.
[384:01.27]So you got this one.
[384:02.39]If you beat this one, then I can sign up for this one and try to move on to C, right?
[384:11.23]Good.
[384:12.53]So what do you need?
[384:16.72]Life.
[384:18.33]And defense.
[384:21.95]Let's do it.
[384:22.53]Uh, life.
[384:26.59]Just do life twice.
[384:29.25]Life, life, rest.
[384:30.19]Sounds good.
[384:31.97]You, on the other hand, you're gonna do... You need, like, intel... I don't have anything for intelligence, do I?
[384:38.14]Just get your intel up.
[384:39.24]Do it twice.
[384:39.88]And then you're gonna do... Yep, sandbag power is good.
[384:44.90]And...
[384:47.21]I also want life.
[384:50.79]No, get the token.
[384:52.99]Pretty good session for everybody.
[385:03.64]Probably should feed most people here.
[385:23.29]Hooray.
[385:27.98]Let's give everybody some potato.
[385:35.06]What console?
[385:35.56]This is on PlayStation 2.
[385:40.54]PS2.
[385:41.20]Are you hungry?
[385:44.68]Yes, you are.
[385:46.12]You've kind of had like a rough couple of days, so we'll give you a banana.
[385:57.47]Okay.
[386:00.31]Are we all good to go?
[386:03.33]Yes.
[386:17.84]Oh, your whole schedule is gone.
[386:19.19]Okay, so you did meditation.
[386:22.69]That's fine.
[386:24.61]I'll change the schedule after this week.
[386:27.52]So who else we got?
[386:28.20]We got... You're doing fine.
[386:30.08]You need to rest anyways.
[386:31.10]So you're doing Life Blade.
[386:33.78]Rest.
[386:35.36]Battle.
[386:37.72]You are going to do Tub.
[386:40.19]Rest.
[386:42.11]Yeah, let's go.
[386:50.13]Pretty good increases all the way around, except for maybe Roberto.
[386:57.49]Jerma, I'm sorry I said you were bad at Sekiro.
[387:01.05]That's alright, as long as you apologized.
[387:03.33]I accept your apology.
[387:04.71]Alright.
[387:10.98]Lively.
[387:14.44]I just want to let you know that your mother loves you.
[387:16.48]Thanks, Mom.
[387:19.31]Alright, so you got something coming up here.
[387:24.25]You kind of all do.
[387:35.69]April Fools.
[387:37.63]No, shit!
[387:41.17]No, I don't know.
[387:41.75]Everyone wanted... No, that's what I wanted.
[387:44.27]I had that queued up already.
[387:48.42]Alright.
[387:49.92]Take a banana or potato.
[387:53.66]Let's do this last tournament and then bring you to rank C. I think you have new stuff.
[388:05.72]Alright, so we got... This is 0 to 60.
[388:11.98]Accuracy rate is B, his far range.
[388:15.89]That's pretty decent crit damage, too.
[388:21.71]I already have these on.
[388:23.45]Drifting.
[388:24.75]Alright, so 0 to 60.
[388:26.43]What's the difference between this and... Let's see.
[388:33.59]Life Damage B, Life Damage C. So this is better.
[388:36.95]Nah, worse.
[388:37.79]With damage.
[388:39.05]It's way more accurate, though.
[388:40.29]Yeah, I would do this way more.
[388:45.50]It's way- Holy shit, look at that.
[388:47.30]It costs 40 Guts to do this.
[388:50.70]It's got a really good hit rate, but... That's a lot.
[388:55.38]Alright, what'd he do?
[388:58.30]You got something else too.
[388:59.06]High Speed Ride.
[389:02.61]Let's you ride your monster at high speed in order to avoid enemies.
[389:09.56]What the hell does that mean?
[389:16.35]Okay, anybody hungry?
[389:17.23]No.
[389:21.35]Alright, tournament time.
[389:30.52]It's a passive or something, somehow.
[389:33.72]It's some kind of passive.
[389:40.54]Ladies and gentlemen, representing the cup.
[389:44.45]Who will arise?
[389:45.15]It's the same dialog every time.
[389:47.53]Alright, Pokey, Poke, Jural, and Cage.
[389:51.41]Alright, Cage.
[389:55.72]158 power, 147 defense.
[389:57.88]You're a chump.
[389:59.12]I will kill you very easily.
[390:01.38]To a point where it is going to be... Yeah.
[390:02.64]See you later.
[390:08.69]I didn't even need to embarrass you.
[390:15.57]Everybody's just afraid of me.
[390:16.53]Alright, this is Jarl.
[390:21.69]Jarl is pretty good.
[390:23.85]177, 172, 155, 151.
[390:24.49]Not that strong with melee, though.
[390:29.89]Alright, so you got a lot of... I don't... Okay, I gotta be wary of your... Why would I... Why even... Are they just gonna give me the trophy for sitting on the bench?
[390:51.04]Pokey... Pokey!
[390:54.15]It's awful.
[390:58.51]Alright, at least Poki Poki is gonna actually fight me.
[391:03.69]He has the worst stats.
[391:04.67]Poki Poki has the worst stats.
[391:06.45]Out of all of them.
[391:09.33]But the bravest, apparently.
[391:15.86]Nasty!
[391:19.70]Alright.
[391:20.30]Well, that was cute.
[391:24.42]Back it up.
[391:25.40]Fine.
[391:25.64]Alright, don't get cocky here.
[391:29.72]Okay, they were gonna hand me the trophy, and now I gotta be careful.
[391:34.44]Just don't fucking let up.
[391:36.12]Drift into the charge.
[391:37.12]18 damage, that's it?
[391:45.98]Poke, you better not win.
[391:48.12]Just do the drum again.
[391:48.88]He's susceptible to it.
[391:50.31]It's over.
[392:00.87]Alright, time to get out of this rank.
[392:10.71]Almost died to Poke Pokeo.
[392:13.14]That's the real question.
[392:14.44]Only three fame.
[392:15.22]People are getting annoyed at how easy this is for him, apparently.
[392:19.76]Are you in a garbage elo?
[392:21.80]Not for long.
[392:29.74]Smurfing and almost losing.
[392:31.62]Yeah, how many times have you guys been smurfing and you have to answer the phone or something and you're playing with one hand?
[392:38.29]Okay.
[392:41.03]This is who is in this one this week.
[392:44.85]Let's get Roberto in here.
[392:48.90]Because we got to start bringing people up.
[392:56.28]Sandbag.
[392:57.72]No, just... yeah, just do it.
[392:59.75]Fuck it, do it.
[393:00.25]He's gonna win.
[393:02.31]What are you gonna do this week?
[393:13.95]Target.
[393:14.35]Right, okay.
[393:18.10]When are you gonna fuse Wally?
[393:25.66]I don't think I'm gonna.
[393:33.88]So now you're ready to go to the final tournament.
[393:37.20]Hopefully I win that tournament.
[393:39.40]Usually the official tournament's a no joke.
[393:40.95]Alright, you're okay.
[393:44.31]Just eat.
[393:44.73]I'll give you something good.
[393:45.93]Here, have a squid.
[393:58.72]Proceed to the weekend activities.
[393:59.92]Yes.
[394:02.06]Let's pull you out here.
[394:05.72]Get him to D rank.
[394:09.96]I heard you're going to propose to Kim tomorrow and then pepper spray her for April Fool's Day.
[394:17.10]Well, I don't know where you heard that from.
[394:19.42]That's a very odd thing to hear.
[394:25.52]Alright, Donna, Kubelik, and Chara.
[394:27.92]Let's just... I don't even need to see what they do.
[394:30.92]I'm gonna insta-kill this person.
[394:39.93]Donna's the toothpaste.
[394:40.85]I'm gonna go double slash.
[394:46.23]Instant kill.
[394:50.50]Well, would've been.
[394:53.97]Alright, well, if you would not be so timid... Good slice.
[395:00.75]Again.
[395:12.19]These are go- it's only two matches, so it's easy.
[395:14.19]I like to do these.
[395:16.05]For these low level ones, I should not be doing the ones that have, uh, four matches or three matches at least.
[395:21.33]Just the ones with two.
[395:35.89]We already saw you before.
[395:36.85]Didn't even get a chance.
[395:52.50]Now we can pull him out of this rank.
[395:53.64]And we're going to do the same thing.
[395:54.74]I'm getting him right to C. I feel like he should be there.
[396:05.54]Butter Crunch ice cream is underrated.
[396:06.92]Butter Crunch ice cream is amazing.
[396:12.11]People say Butter Pecan, but no.
[396:13.43]Get the pecans out of there.
[396:19.67]Butter Crunch is Butter Pecan ice cream, but no pecans.
[396:25.65]How are things?
[396:26.25]Need anything today?
[396:26.95]Go ahead.
[396:27.31]Take a look around.
[396:28.97]What will you do?
[396:29.49]Alright.
[396:29.93]What do you got?
[396:31.97]Effect.
[396:33.63]Oh.
[396:36.90]Alright, we need to get any more training gadgets I can buy.
[396:38.88]I already have this.
[396:42.21]Tub.
[396:43.21]Trampoline.
[396:43.81]Target.
[396:44.93]Book.
[396:46.49]So one thing I do not have.
[396:47.59]Shit.
[396:56.25]It's one by two?
[396:57.29]Wait, I don't... I have enough room, don't I?
[397:05.73]How's that not enough room?
[397:12.24]Trampoline.
[397:18.52]Which one's not going to be used?
[397:22.99]Oh, 7 out of 7.
[397:23.73]Oh.
[397:26.13]This thing is so huge.
[397:31.91]I wonder which one I should get rid of.
[397:43.15]Maybe the speed.
[397:44.59]For now.
[397:45.23]Just put it away.
[397:46.03]I got everything.
[397:49.08]No appraisal?
[397:50.14]No.
[398:09.91]Leveling intelligence.
[398:11.29]Yeah.
[398:12.47]One of the monsters I have is an int-based.
[398:18.01]Wally is an intelligence-based monster.
[398:22.71]Alright, let's queue up some shit.
[398:25.95]Calendar.
[398:26.41]Alright, here you go.
[398:29.30]Roberto.
[398:30.72]Official tournament.
[398:32.08]Sign up for it.
[398:34.71]And then the next day, official tournament for Vroomer.
[398:38.19]And then Wall-E, who cares?
[398:39.40]I guess Wall-E could do this one right here, just to get ready.
[398:41.88]I don't know, I want them to train.
[398:46.06]Wall-E, you do this one.
[398:53.73]Wall-E, go read the book.
[398:55.75]Sorry, I wanted you, yeah, rest, tub, tub.
[399:01.00]Rest.
[399:02.14]Lifeblade.
[399:02.80]Lifeblade.
[399:04.56]Good.
[399:05.34]Book.
[399:06.54]Book.
[399:07.30]Rest.
[399:08.14]And then probably... Lifeblade.
[399:10.57]You.
[399:10.91]Rest.
[399:11.99]Lifeblade.
[399:12.49]Lifeblade.
[399:14.39]Rest.
[399:14.93]Sandbag.
[399:16.73]Nope.
[399:31.96]Yeah, sandbag tub rest.
[399:34.21]Good to go.
[399:37.93]Did he actually read the book?
[399:54.76]You're so cute.
[399:58.58]You're hungry too.
[399:59.19]Here, come here.
[400:07.92]He's learning.
[400:08.58]Yeah, his intelligence moves, the green moves are the ones that are based on him.
[400:14.67]Though the more intelligence you have, the more damage those moves will do.
[400:18.59]You understand?
[400:29.40]Alright, get in the tub.
[400:33.74]You can rest.
[400:34.40]No, you can lie.
[400:35.12]You're fine.
[400:36.14]No, book.
[400:36.72]Okay, book.
[400:38.02]Double life blade.
[400:39.79]Sounds good to me.
[400:46.85]Nice.
[400:48.69]After this, we're gonna start to do... We're gonna hammer a tournament.
[400:56.50]Frustrated, oh no.
[400:58.52]Having trouble with the reading.
[401:01.24]You're just doing okay.
[401:02.42]Let's tell you you're doing a good job.
[401:14.41]I have a squid too.
[401:18.81]Alright.
[401:21.95]I gotta get one of these guys to like ranks B or A.
[401:26.81]Before they die.
[401:27.57]Is he going to die soon?
[401:30.71]Alright.
[401:43.38]Tub.
[401:45.82]Frustrated.
[401:46.36]Have a rest.
[401:47.54]Lifeblade.
[401:48.10]Rest.
[401:48.70]Good.
[401:49.42]Just go.
[401:55.11]That was a good amount.
[402:03.19]Yeah, I'm going to hammer tournaments here.
[402:08.80]I should be able to jump up like two ranks real quick.
[402:11.38]Just do three tournaments and four tournaments in a row and win them all.
[402:19.70]Summer, week four.
[402:23.08]You guys are hungry now.
[402:25.39]You can rest.
[402:31.63]I'll have to feed you guys all in a minute here.
[402:42.86]Feeding time.
[402:43.62]Here you go.
[402:44.04]No, no.
[402:47.18]Food.
[402:49.37]Your favorite!
[402:54.89]There you go, Wall-E.
[402:57.23]What a good boy.
[403:01.07]You, uh... You're okay, but here.
[403:07.58]You gotta sleep have a good night.
[403:09.26]Yeah, it's getting late We'll probably call it here in a little bit after like another tournament or two It is getting late It's getting to be just about 2 a.m eastern so we will call it fairly soon here
[403:43.47]I at least want to rank up two people.
[403:47.81]We're going to start doing that now.
[403:49.98]So this is the tournament for Wall-E.
[403:52.06]Hopefully we can bring Wall-E up.
[404:03.91]Nice.
[404:04.17]A nice life increase for Broomer.
[404:06.15]That's good.
[404:08.29]I think everyone's good to go.
[404:09.45]Fight with Wall-E.
[404:10.23]Yeah, you're good.
[404:14.11]Good.
[404:15.80]Good.
[404:16.12]Yeah, after these tournaments, we'll call it a night.
[404:29.37]And then I think I might... I think I might get rid of Wall-E.
[404:36.64]I'm not sure he's too... He's great fusing.
[404:39.96]I would fuse Wall-E with somebody else.
[404:44.72]I'm gonna have to make somebody else, though.
[404:49.03]Wall-E versus Yellow.
[404:50.27]This is a... ...intelligence-based enemy.
[404:53.21]That's fine.
[405:06.53]Wally's really cute, but... We'll see.
[405:11.81]If he one-hits, he kills this guy, maybe.
[405:15.55]Oh, Wally has another move, too.
[405:33.94]Look at that damage.
[405:34.70]There's only 48...
[405:37.90]We used to see a number that was over 100.
[405:42.85]Gatti's terrible.
[405:47.67]Gatti would probably give up, no?
[405:51.53]This is a really high defense.
[405:52.57]Maybe it's good to keep him around.
[405:54.13]I wish you could unfreeze.
[405:57.04]Because he just has really high defense.
[406:10.44]47.
[406:10.54]Okay.
[406:10.94]I'll go with the gun one.
[406:19.74]31%.
[406:19.76]47.
[406:19.78]I mean, this thing has the highest hit percentage, right?
[406:32.09]Doesn't do very... 34 damage quality.
[406:33.89]Come on, you're really starting to... get cold here.
[406:46.43]And I do mean that very, very literally.
[406:50.82]It's Kylon.
[406:51.62]This is the dog, right?
[406:53.34]This dog is stuck.
[406:57.40]In, like, wood.
[406:59.54]You know, they're like, oh, bronze!
[407:08.15]Silver!
[407:08.57]No, this isn't, you're in wood.
[407:11.70]How come they don't do that shit?
[407:13.26]Why is it not wood, cloth, cloth, wood, stone, bronze?
[407:19.34]That's what it should be.
[407:21.83]Oh, God.
[407:22.75]Joel just came in with a raid.
[407:23.81]What's going on, guys?
[407:28.65]Thank you, Joel.
[407:30.95]We are currently playing Monster Rancher 4.
[407:33.41]Hope you had a good stream.
[407:38.15]I don't know, what were you doing earlier?
[407:40.95]What was Joel just screaming?
[407:50.58]Shitposts?
[407:55.44]What?
[407:56.52]Oh, a microphone game.
[407:57.54]Oh, okay.
[407:59.22]Well, welcome or god thanks a lot again, Joel for the raid.
[408:04.58]Uh, it's gonna be hard for me to explain what the hell's going on in the screen here.
[408:07.70]But, if you're familiar with Monster Rancher...
[408:11.54]You breed monsters and you fight them and then you miss 5 to 10 times in a row of your moves because they're only at a 27%.
[408:19.12]And then it gets even worse because now I'm going to be at about, yeah, 12%.
[408:27.75]Eventually, I will kill this.
[408:29.16]Or I won't.
[408:30.54]We're actually about to turn this monster into Gruul.
[408:36.16]We're going to grind him down and use him as DNA.
[408:38.88]Because he's really proving right now just why he shouldn't be on the roster.
[408:43.46]He's very cute, though.
[408:52.28]Yeah, they made five of these games for console, and they made like three for DS, and like two for Game Boy Advance.
[409:04.04]Can you do anything?
[409:05.32]Come on.
[409:07.30]I was just pressing L1 right there, because I was really hopeful that I could bring in one of my other teammates.
[409:15.23]This is E rank.
[409:16.05]This is fucking Wood League.
[409:18.07]This is a bad indicator, guys.
[409:22.19]I was killing enemies in one hit with the other people.
[409:28.46]And that dog didn't even do anything, didn't even attack.
[409:38.19]Still won.
[409:41.35]Grind him up!
[409:44.41]He already has d- good stats, he just- I don't know, what is it?
[409:47.96]His accuracy is just terrible.
[409:52.50]8 fame's not bad.
[409:53.22]The game can hear you guys talking.
[410:04.22]He won all those fights, but he still sucks.
[410:05.92]Yeah, but he does still suck.
[410:08.17]He's really cute and he's really funny and really cool, but he doesn't hold a candle to either one of these two.
[410:14.25]Like, watch.
[410:15.75]Take a look at this.
[410:17.15]Ready?
[410:18.65]Well, not today, but tomorrow.
[410:20.07]Meditation.
[410:20.77]Everyone's good to go.
[410:21.61]I'm kind of tired, but you really need to keep... You can rest tomorrow.
[410:25.21]This is... Roberto has his tournament.
[410:30.29]This is a rank-up tournament, I think, isn't it?
[410:33.19]These both are rank-up tournaments, so they gotta be both ready.
[410:35.76]Okay.
[410:38.24]Look at those terrible... Those bad increases, too.
[410:47.42]Your siblings are doing way better than you.
[410:50.16]I'm gonna go scold him.
[410:52.46]There's only one way.
[410:55.27]I've been spoiling him too much.
[411:04.13]No, alright.
[411:05.35]Let me say... I'll be nice.
[411:07.29]Tenta, thanks for five community subs, Tenta.
[411:11.33]Tenta coming in with five subs.
[411:12.92]Thank you.
[411:15.68]You need to eat.
[411:19.86]Have a potato.
[411:22.94]They won't learn if you are kind.
[411:25.85]I've been... pretty harsh.
[411:32.81]You've seen me be harsh.
[411:33.71]Alright, here we go.
[411:45.68]Weekends, activities...
[411:48.88]Uh, it's tomorrow.
[411:50.38]Yeah.
[411:52.14]No competitions are scheduled this week.
[411:53.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[411:56.64]Wait, hold on.
[411:59.93]Oh, no, you're right.
[412:00.53]It's here and then here, right?
[412:04.33]Okay.
[412:10.35]Don't scold Wally yet, since he just won.
[412:12.11]That's true.
[412:15.17]So now we have... You were planning on resting today, but I think I'm just resting tomorrow.
[412:22.81]What do you need?
[412:27.29]Lifeblade.
[412:29.81]Ah, you.
[412:32.03]You can rest.
[412:34.15]You, it's your tournament, so you rest too.
[412:36.37]Yeah.
[412:37.43]And we'll give you a good encouragement before you battle.
[412:45.11]Nice.
[412:51.07]Jerma blocked Joel in fear of the message- Oh, the- Wait, what?
[412:58.40]Frustrated.
[412:58.92]That's not good.
[413:00.72]But you can relax tomorrow.
[413:01.76]You don't have to do anything.
[413:05.76]I didn't see it.
[413:06.40]I didn't see- What did he write?
[413:07.28]Alright, you're good.
[413:08.56]Lively, focused.
[413:09.36]You're good to go.
[413:12.74]Let's go stomp the E-Rank.
[413:17.40]This is an official Grade E competition.
[413:25.24]We should do this fairly easily.
[413:28.33]Why am I playing Neopets?
[413:31.49]You don't know what Monster Rancher is.
[413:32.73]Neopets is like a... a JPG game.
[413:40.82]This is real animations on the screen.
[413:43.46]You don't just watch your character load as a picture on the screen.
[413:53.20]My Neopet hasn't been fed in 10 years.
[413:55.25]Well, that's on you.
[413:57.71]Alright, we know these people already.
[414:00.49]Sunny is pretty strong.
[414:02.61]But not as strong as Roberto.
[414:06.25]I would assume half these people are going to give up.
[414:13.26]I'm gonna go with double slash.
[414:17.34]Yeah, we've seen this before.
[414:18.38]We've battled this before.
[414:20.04]Watch this.
[414:22.42]Bye.
[414:24.86]You guys want to keep Rube- uh, no, no.
[414:26.51]You guys want to keep- Lookit.
[414:27.99]Oh.
[414:28.83]How's that?
[414:30.79]Instantly dead.
[414:32.69]I don't have like a jokey fucking glove come out of my... clam.
[414:37.83]And hit seven times in a row.
[414:39.23]No.
[414:40.11]We just steamroll.
[414:51.39]He loves you, though.
[414:52.30]Yeah, but we only have three slots.
[414:54.68]And you can't unfreeze people.
[414:57.80]In Monster Rancher 4, you cannot bring them back.
[415:01.70]You can only retire them forever and then use them as DNA.
[415:07.51]I don't even have to look at these.
[415:12.29]We do double slash into side slash.
[415:14.37]And that's it.
[415:20.55]Let the other two just carry him.
[415:23.91]I mean, I could.
[415:24.71]He's dead.
[415:28.25]One hit.
[415:34.42]I don't even need to see their stats.
[415:36.62]He's too good.
[415:44.20]Oh, your opponent quit, by the way.
[415:49.43]Just give me the trophy already.
[416:03.14]Oh, who knew?
[416:03.64]Yeah, that the Transformer was gonna be the best one.
[416:15.44]You getting cocky?
[416:16.74]Cocky streamer?
[416:17.78]Kind of.
[416:22.65]But I think it's worth being cocky here, because... I mean, seriously.
[416:35.70]I just don't belong in this rank.
[416:38.10]I gotta get up to D and C with Roberto.
[416:41.22]He's just way better than everybody here.
[416:45.96]Is it Roberto of rank?
[416:47.16]No.
[416:47.30]Rumor is rank D. About to attempt to go to rank C.
[416:53.16]I think I already win.
[416:56.10]Yeah, there's no way anyone can come back.
[416:57.72]If I- I just have to win, that's to beat Harris.
[416:59.52]Alright, if I don't one-hit kill Harris, I will give 5,000 community subs.
[417:14.17]I- I'm kidding!
[417:15.47]I'm kidding, that's a joke, by the way.
[417:20.10]Technically didn't hit him yet.
[417:22.08]Technically didn't hit him.
[417:23.12]I swung, but I missed one hit.
[417:27.30]Technically didn't hit him.
[417:34.25]Didn't hit him.
[417:35.49]I have to hit him.
[417:40.77]Alright, that's...
[417:45.89]I told you it was a joke already.
[417:46.95]I was kidding.
[417:47.37]I told you immediately it was a joke.
[417:48.91]I can't do that.
[417:51.33]I'll go to jail if I do that.
[417:54.32]By the way, April Fools.
[417:55.96]You believed it?
[417:56.78]Unbelievable.
[417:59.68]April Fools.
[418:03.16]You know those things that people say on April Fools and it's like, Whoa, what the fuck?
[418:07.05]Is that real?
[418:07.75]Is that shit real?
[418:09.97]Nope.
[418:10.53]Not today.
[418:11.23]Not on this special day.
[418:12.27]I can say whatever I want.
[418:14.07]I can tell you.
[418:14.51]Hey, I'm like 6'2".
[418:16.27]April fucking close.
[418:16.95]I can say whatever I want.
[418:18.01]Today's the day where you can say anything you want.
[418:23.64]You already did a joke.
[418:24.56]No, I ate a cereal I like.
[418:38.96]Dude, you guys understand how much that is?
[418:43.50]The comedy cereal was not April Fool's, it was just comedy cereal.
[418:48.12]I just said as an April Fool's joke, I'm gonna give 5,000 community subs if I don't one-hit this person.
[418:52.62]It was an April Fool's gag.
[418:55.91]It's $25,000.
[419:10.36]$25,000.
[419:10.92]Holy fuck.
[419:17.54]Yeah, I get to have... I get to have my April Fools joke.
[419:23.77]That's what it was.
[419:25.73]Thank God this is today.
[419:27.79]Thank God it's like April Fools everywhere in the world right now.
[419:30.82]Because that's my excuse and it's a good one.
[419:33.98]If this was any other day.
[419:37.56]It's just... It's the fucking liar day.
[419:45.35]Alright, you need to rest.
[419:52.08]It's 11pm for me, I'm speaking to you Ed, it's midnight for you.
[420:06.94]Why did I even say that?
[420:08.05]I know it was like I was doing an April Fool's thing, but... I'm not fucking doing that.
[420:12.13]Are you kidding me?
[420:14.27]That would, like, ruin me.
[420:32.19]Consolation prize?
[420:33.09]Alright, fine.
[420:33.51]I'll play Minecraft VR for like 30 minutes.
[420:36.45]In like a week or two.
[420:37.15]Alright, you're fed.
[421:00.07]Uh, you're okay.
[421:01.07]I want to feed you.
[421:05.05]Leave a carrot.
[421:07.17]You already owe us Minecraft VR.
[421:18.11]Five fucking thousand.
[421:19.47]Give me the resub.
[421:22.61]Thank God it's April Fool's.
[421:28.65]What's the worst thing you've ever smelled?
[421:29.95]One time there were eggs in the sink.
[421:31.97]And they were wet.
[421:33.95]And it ruined my whole afternoon.
[421:39.09]The cooked eggs.
[421:43.98]Yeah, wet eggs is the worst thing you could ever fucking smell in your life.
[421:48.16]Alright, this is the one.
[421:50.86]This is the one that actually really matters because this is to go to rank C.
[422:08.72]Only the winner will move on.
[422:11.24]We have Rumor versus Third.
[422:18.64]Very balanced.
[422:19.34]High intelligence.
[422:21.26]Decent speed.
[422:24.54]But what about me?
[422:25.22]216, 194.
[422:25.38]Come on, I'm unstoppable here.
[422:28.90]Never forget the 5,000 subs.
[422:45.89]April Fools.
[422:46.80]I can say whatever the fuck I want.
[422:51.04]Hey guys, my book will be done in like two or three days.
[422:53.94]It's like 1700 pages.
[423:01.39]You can say whatever the fuck you want on April Fools.
[423:05.09]All encompassing.
[423:06.31]Any lie, you can say anything.
[423:17.61]Tornado.
[423:18.15]Not bad.
[423:21.21]Okay, let's go to charge.
[423:22.35]That's a good dodge.
[423:27.71]Eat that.
[423:36.25]Really?
[423:38.67]Super Claw.
[423:41.88]I'm fine.
[423:43.18]Let's head back.
[423:43.62]Let's get the guarantee here.
[423:45.82]Zero to sixty.
[423:46.52]Sixty percent.
[423:49.23]Get out of my life.
[424:01.40]Colorado versus Estate.
[424:02.44]I don't think we've even seen Estate yet.
[424:08.63]How do I feel about chat?
[424:10.17]Well, there's 3,630 people here.
[424:13.37]I think 3,629 of them are amazing.
[424:17.22]The one is one person.
[424:18.16]I don't know.
[424:18.42]I'm not going to say who it is.
[424:20.46]I hate them.
[424:21.20]There's one person here.
[424:22.60]I'm not going to tell you who it is.
[424:28.26]3,602.
[424:28.28]I love 3,601.
[424:30.14]There's one person here.
[424:30.92]I don't like them.
[424:33.69]That's the way it is.
[424:34.65]Alright.
[424:35.91]Vrooma versus Estate.
[424:36.99]Estate lost the last match.
[424:40.47]High intelligence.
[424:42.13]Let's just burn you down with power moves.
[424:52.98]It's Joel, isn't it?
[424:54.02]I don't wanna... I don't wanna say anything.
[425:03.99]Thunder.
[425:07.49]Thank God, it didn't hurt that much.
[425:08.83]Alright, let's go with the... Let's get... Come on.
[425:11.45]0 to 60.
[425:12.43]67%.
[425:12.47]Get it!
[425:14.07]That sucks to lose that.
[425:15.15]But I'm gonna go for it again because I max bet.
[425:18.81]It was worth it.
[425:19.91]See?
[425:24.81]Oh, I gotta chill the fuck out here.
[425:25.93]I have no guts now.
[425:32.03]Uh...
[425:35.84]Joel is... No, that's fine.
[425:36.98]I told you I didn't want to say.
[425:38.82]That doesn't mean who it is.
[425:40.20]I said I just don't... I don't... I'm not comfortable saying.
[425:48.66]Holy shit, that was a ton of damage.
[425:50.74]I gotta get... I gotta end this right now.
[425:53.37]I gotta charge in right now.
[425:54.41]Get it.

[426:05.45]Kristen with 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[426:06.97]They say, hope one day you can stop hating me.
[426:11.43]Rewind to the Ryan.
[426:17.86]Well, that implies that it's you.

[427:45.98]Read a book.
[427:48.16]I'm sorry.
[427:48.62]Let's go.
[427:51.56]Oh!
[427:51.82]It's another wheel!
[427:55.42]This is like the bubblegum wheel.
[427:58.87]Wow.
[428:08.17]It's so cute.
[428:09.09]It really is.
[428:09.53]Too bad it's going to die.
[428:12.67]It's like a fish.
[428:17.07]It's a bubblegum fish on a wheel.
[428:19.43]Or like a grapefruit slice.
[428:26.83]If you have to rank C, I can't wait.
[428:32.16]Who is it?
[428:32.56]Do I even have any competition?
[428:33.94]Definitely not.
[428:35.68]Oh, actually, Calabrino's not doing terrible.
[428:38.73]Let's see what happens here.
[428:40.79]Alright, Calabrino is killing everybody.
[428:43.39]3-0.
[428:44.03]Alright, I gotta be prepared for this.
[428:54.65]The fish is insane to get.
[428:56.03]I have two CDs out of, like, 200 that has fish.
[429:00.33]Oh, God.
[429:06.83]Terrible intelligence.
[429:08.35]Decent speed.
[429:09.65]Really not that great.
[429:29.20]Missed.
[429:30.48]Sorry.
[429:38.72]Can't block that.
[429:40.82]We're playing more of this?
[429:41.66]I don't know, that could mean there's a lot of meaning there.
[429:47.40]As in, he's dead.
[429:48.66]Yeah, he gave up.
[429:51.56]So, maybe you're talking about, you think this is Monster Rancher 2?
[429:54.48]This is actually Monster Rancher 4.
[429:56.83]So, if you'd like more of this, like, oh, this is a different game, or more of this, maybe you came here like seven hours ago, and you're still in this one, and we're going to keep playing it.
[430:05.89]Just making sure I cover all the bases there.
[430:08.06]Answer all your questions.
[430:13.14]Alright, this is... If Calabrino does this... Alright, this is bad.
[430:19.52]I have to beat Calabrino or I don't.
[430:21.04]Only one person can win this.
[430:24.37]One of these other scrubs matter.
[430:25.43]Alright, here it is.
[430:32.15]This is for the championship.
[430:34.01]For to rank up.
[430:36.35]Why are you so good?
[430:37.47]That's why, okay.
[430:39.91]High intelligence, tons of life.
[430:43.17]Just watch out for the intelligence moves.
[430:44.53]Defense is terrible, though.
[430:47.95]Alright, just watch out for the high intelligence moves.
[430:55.48]Wait!
[430:56.90]You two aren't planning on entering the competition.
[430:59.06]You've got to be kidding me.
[431:02.12]I think you're a little late.
[431:04.63]Sorry, but I'll beat you in a single punch.
[431:06.57]Wait, is this... Because my Kellerino doesn't have any more time to waste on you.
[431:11.91]Oh, this is the... This is the lady from the beginning, right.
[431:16.08]This is her Kellerino.
[431:24.49]Well, I have to beat this.
[431:25.37]Vroomer versus Kellerino.
[431:33.60]Right off the bat.
[431:37.10]What was that?
[431:38.52]Mosquitoes out tonight?
[431:41.50]What was it?
[431:43.44]Mosquitoes out tonight?
[431:48.61]I'm going to back it up.
[432:02.01]Let's get the guarantee thing.
[432:02.82]63%, 0 to 60.
[432:04.58]Kill it.
[432:06.50]Yes!
[432:07.54]That was a big crit too.
[432:08.56]Alright, we're gonna go with the charge.
[432:11.66]And end it.
[432:15.23]Alright, you're fine.
[432:17.13]I'm composed.
[432:18.05]Uh oh.
[432:23.31]Okay, slow down.
[432:23.93]I only have 22.
[432:27.09]That's not good.
[432:27.77]That's actually really bad.
[432:29.59]Oh, what?
[432:30.67]Skittos out tonight?
[432:39.92]17, come on!
[432:42.62]Uh, you get to do that.
[432:45.22]You get to do final guts more than a final time.
[432:50.63]You're gonna make 15 of these?
[433:03.03]Oh my god, why?
[433:04.99]Don't you dare.
[433:06.97]Two fucking revives.
[433:09.19]Oh, what do we got?
[433:10.42]Fucking mosquitoes out tonight?
[433:11.78]Alright, okay, that's not good.
[433:12.92]This is actually really fucking bad.
[433:14.02]This is terrible.
[433:20.68]I'm dead.
[433:33.08]He got to revive twice.
[433:35.15]What the fuck was that?
[433:39.51]Why?
[433:41.05]Nothing about that was fair.
[433:43.55]He got to come back to life.
[433:46.06]Final time.
[433:48.30]Two final times.
[433:52.88]That was fucking stupid.
[433:54.75]Alright, that's it.
[433:55.33]I'm going to bed.
[434:08.67]Now I have to do that all again.
[434:09.93]Yeah, that was not your fault.
[434:16.55]That was bullshit.
[434:25.16]Uh... Oh yeah, Roberto has a rank up, doesn't he?
[434:32.24]Yeah, he does.
[434:35.96]Uh...
[434:39.28]So annoyed by that.
[434:40.78]The credits are going to be long tonight, you know, due to the 5,000 subs.
[434:50.60]You know how fast that would go?
[434:56.94]That would break my computer.
[435:01.54]Alright, let's at least get some good out of this.
[435:09.86]And rank him up.
[435:12.06]Everyone was such a joke.
[435:12.98]And then you get the double final... Ugh, that's... Come on.
[435:17.56]Wait.
[435:19.28]When is this?
[435:23.07]Doesn't he have a rank up?
[435:24.89]What's going on?
[435:31.81]Did I miss it?
[435:34.45]No, this is yesterday.
[435:35.81]What happened here?
[435:37.89]Did I skip this?
[435:42.67]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[435:44.05]Look at this.
[435:45.19]The next one's all the way in October. ...
[436:10.41]Oh no, he did rank up!
[436:11.33]He did, he did, he did, he did.
[436:13.65]He did rank up.
[436:14.31]I remember, it was so easy that he ranked up.
[436:20.41]He's now in Rank D. Right, okay.
[436:22.84]Yeah, I'm gonna, I'll save the game.
[436:25.98]Thanks everybody for watching.
[436:27.58]I will see you guys, uh, not tomorrow, the next day.
[436:30.12]We're probably gonna play more of this.
[436:32.67]I wanna be, I wanna beat this game.
[436:38.43]So I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[436:42.15]We'll probably go Tuesday, Wednesday.
[436:44.61]Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[436:45.48]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[436:49.32]And let's do the bits.
[436:55.36]And there was a ton of community subs tonight.
[436:58.18]You'll see them all in a minute here.
[437:04.39]The guild?
[437:04.79]Oh, don't worry.
[437:05.09]I won't forget.
[437:05.53]I won't forget about the guild.
[437:06.43]Don't worry.
[437:08.96]We will determine what we're going to do with Wall-E in the stream on Tuesday.
[437:17.30]Hope you enjoyed it.
[437:17.98]That was fun.
[437:18.44]I had a blast.
[437:20.45]It's definitely better than 3.
[437:23.19]And we'll see how much better it is than 2 once we get some more monsters in the mix.
[437:28.55]But let's go back to about 7 and a half hours ago.
[437:30.63]Let's read some of these bits.
[437:36.17]Combine Wall-E.
[437:37.05]Yeah, we'll see what happens.
[437:40.56]Let's see what happens to Wally.
[437:43.52]Will he be used?
[437:44.28]Okay, so now let me get this.
[437:53.30]Um... Now why?
[437:53.78]Why?
[437:53.94]Let's see.
[437:54.52]Okay, there we go.
[438:12.85]Well, this whole thing screwed up.
[438:16.15]Did it?
[438:16.73]Yeah, it did.
[438:18.95]Well, looks like we're gonna have to start from here.
[438:23.02]Because my Streamlabs decided to stop showing anything up until about four hours ago.
[438:37.83]So that's odd, but I'll just use the other site.
[438:42.12]Let's use the jermaMustard site.
[438:57.49]Uh, there it is.
[438:58.21]Wait, no, stop.
[439:05.63]Uh, where is that site?
[439:06.93]I had it book... I thought I had it bookmarked.
[439:11.21]So I'm going to link me real quick.
[439:13.93]Why is this not in my bookmarks?
[439:24.86]Extreme Labs, why do you have to do this?
[439:30.80]It's like, it's like, it poked a dex or something, what is it called?
[439:43.67]I know, I know where you guys go.
[439:44.85]No, not the Pokédex.
[439:56.60]Why must you do this to me, Streamlabs?
[440:07.77]Let me see if I can pull it from here.
[440:12.15]Yeah, because right now it's only showing me from the last, like, two hours now.
[440:16.05]It's all fucked up.
[440:17.79]Why?
[440:18.21]What the hell?
[440:35.47]Alright, let me see if I can find the site.
[440:46.44]Does anybody have a link to this site?
[440:47.86]Does anybody remember what this site was?
[440:48.96]Because it's not in my bookmarks.
[441:01.25]No, it's not.
[441:02.07]That's not it.
[441:21.35]yeah I'm checking my history for it I don't know why it's not here I didn't we used it like not even like a month ago that is the side is it
[441:49.60]The URL changed.
[441:50.78]Oh.
[441:54.67]That's probably why.
[441:55.37]Oh, yeah.
[442:06.01]Okay.
[442:09.96]We weren't memeing you.
[442:15.74]I was wondering.
[442:16.20]I was like, why the hell can I not see it?
[442:27.20]It's a .org.
[442:39.20]The layout looks great.
[442:40.10]Yeah, whoever put this together, somebody in the community, did a hell of a job.
[442:43.98]This looks, this is beautiful.
[442:47.16]I should just fucking use this only.
[442:55.99]Yeah, lazy Luke, right?
[442:58.56]Alright, so let's go earlier.
[443:13.59]So we had... Mostly lost.
[443:18.80]Thank you for the 250.
[443:23.47]They say, hey Jimmy, any thoughts of jumping on the GTA RP gravy train?
[443:28.37]I've been enjoying watching it a ton and you'd probably be great at it.
[443:30.67]We actually talked about it.
[443:32.66]Not too long ago.
[443:34.94]A few streams ago, I think, about how... I love RP.
[443:39.32]I love doing, like, routines and bits.
[443:43.04]But I don't really do... I don't do well with strangers.
[443:47.46]And when there's, like, more than three, four, five, six people on the screen, everyone's doing their own routine...
[443:52.74]It's almost like you kind of wait in line to tell your joke.
[443:57.20]And I'm more comfortable doing it with people that I know.
[443:59.16]People that I know I can bounce off of really easily.
[444:06.06]It's not that I can't do it or don't want to do it.
[444:10.24]But it's just something I would rather not do.
[444:14.79]There's nothing against GTA RP at all.
[444:16.95]I think it's fucking fantastic that people are able to jump on and make these characters and have this awesome time.
[444:22.90]It's awesome.
[444:28.82]Don't do it with strangers.
[444:30.48]Yeah, but then you kind of, you gotta, you gotta get, like, in a group of at least a few people.
[444:34.22]I know there's a few people that, um, I know that do it.
[444:38.00]Like, Kiwo does it.
[444:38.90]Uh, I don't, I think Kiwo's probably the only person that I know that does GTA RP that I could, like, talk to and be like, hey, yeah, let's, let me join you.
[444:50.45]But don't you also have to get, like, whitelisted?
[444:54.51]And isn't that a process of, I would have to be on a list and there's priority and stuff.
[445:03.09]It's not just something I can just do.
[445:04.96]It's not like, hey, I'm gonna do GTRP tomorrow.
[445:07.52]I'd have to get on a queue, right?
[445:19.70]On some servers?
[445:21.36]Yeah, I mean, maybe.
[445:23.63]I feel like it's hit its apex.
[445:27.69]Is it still something people want to see?
[445:29.17]I mean, maybe I would look into it and see if it was something that was possible with a few friends or something.
[445:36.61]Just grease your way in with streamer charm.
[445:42.54]If I could go in there with a few friends, and make something happen, and play off of people that I know, then I'm not against it.
[445:55.13]Maybe it's worth a try.
[445:58.38]But we did talk about it a while ago.
[446:00.74]Like, last week or so.
[446:02.34]But thank you.
[446:03.34]Hey, Lazy Luke!
[446:04.78]Speak of the devil.
[446:06.18]I drew a Jerma version of my favorite album cover.
[446:08.36]No offense to your beautiful hair.
[446:11.56]Let's see this.
[446:14.18]Does this look infected?
[446:15.22]Does this look bald?
[446:18.46]What the hell?
[446:20.90]Is this- was this actually a Sum 41 cover?
[446:30.38]Sum 41.
[446:40.10]That's fucked up.
[446:41.02]That's not safe for fucking work.
[446:45.23]Don't click that if you're at work.
[446:46.97]That looks 4 a.m.
[446:48.39]Hey, don't click that if you're at work at 2 or 3 a.m.
[446:57.57]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[446:59.46]The website's fucking beautiful, by the way.
[447:06.23]Uh, Solharv, thanks for the $2.95, Solharv.
[447:10.98]What a travesty.
[447:12.06]That should never be a thing.
[447:13.15]I did not know that.
[447:14.05]But, uh, yes, I think they're using lines from Cryptark in the 3D version.
[447:16.75]I think they're just porting lots of lines over.
[447:18.47]I haven't been asked to record anything new yet.
[447:39.19]Maybe, I think they're just kind of going to be using the old lines.
[447:41.39]Because it is like a reimagining 3D version of it, right?
[447:47.09]We'll see.
[447:48.09]We will see.
[447:50.58]Thank you, Jay Zanye West, for the 10 bucks.
[447:54.48]Work put me in charge of monthly charity donations, so any leftovers are going to the Jerm Research Foundation.
[448:02.03]I'll take them.
[448:03.09]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[448:06.25]Appreciate it, Jay Zanye West.
[448:10.51]for the $10.
[448:11.97]Smelly boy thanks for the $2.50.
[448:14.63]Remember how they got the he will not divide us flag one of those times by honking a car horn near it and getting feedback from chat?
[448:23.87]Someone's eventually going to figure it out with the vrooming car.
[448:29.13]Where you are.
[448:38.27]I think you severely underestimate how many busy fucking roads are here.
[448:49.36]Jerma lied about 5k subs, a new fucking username.
[448:52.68]God.
[448:55.80]That's just Vegas, man.
[448:58.77]That's just the way it is.
[449:06.33]You live near a NASCAR track.
[449:08.89]I don't know.
[449:10.35]I have no idea.
[449:11.05]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[449:14.68]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for the $4.
[449:16.30]This is me 604th dollar I've given to you.
[449:20.54]Took two years of being subbed and dropping 100 bits every so often to get there.
[449:24.75]I'm not that one guy who gave $600 in two hours, but I at least got the boomer badge.
[449:30.51]Take care of me, $604.
[449:33.89]P.S.
[449:35.17]Here's a new picture of Jupiter.
[449:37.47]And it's a new NASA picture.
[449:38.81]Look at that.
[449:39.49]Beautiful.
[449:42.69]Look at that.
[449:47.16]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[449:50.47]$600 in five seconds, $600 in two years.
[449:52.95]It's still $600.
[449:53.53]And it's... I'm shocked that people continue to pay money to me.
[450:02.20]I just hope you still like the streams.
[450:03.42]I hope you're still having a good time.
[450:07.20]Because that's a lot of money to give anybody.
[450:09.48]It is.
[450:11.29]Thank you.
[450:16.73]And thank you so much to DubskiDude.
[450:20.35]For the 250, hey Jerma, back in January I gave bits and made a gotcha joke saying my friend almost died in a walk-in oven.
[450:27.93]Now he's actually in the hospital.
[450:29.33]That's not good.
[450:31.53]Uh, due to having some blood clots.
[450:33.65]That's not, that's not good at all.
[450:38.56]Also, my dad had a heart attack on the same day.
[450:41.00]Both are doing fine now, thankfully.
[450:43.68]Just figured I'd share this bit of dark irony.
[450:45.76]Stay healthy, everyone.
[450:46.66]Well, that's, I'm glad they're doing fine.
[450:52.54]But damn.
[450:57.22]Thankfully, they're good.
[450:59.06]Thankfully, they're good to go.
[451:03.27]Stay healthy, everyone.
[451:03.97]That's true.
[451:08.37]Thank you, Dubski, for the $2.50.
[451:11.37]Glad everyone's okay.
[451:14.31]ProcefProStar, thanks for the $5.
[451:16.17]Play this visual novel, but not Doki Doki Literature Club.
[451:20.80]With a thumbs up guy.
[451:23.96]Uh, this is not a visual novel.
[451:27.04]This is a monster breeding simulator.
[451:36.99]Hey, a wild marrow.
[451:38.23]Thanks for the $25.
[451:40.93]No message.
[451:41.75]Just 25 bucks.
[451:44.02]Thank you so much.
[451:47.14]Cheer 10, cheer 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[451:47.86]Thank you.
[451:51.24]Thank you, Rogue Fort, for the $11.
[451:54.28]I await his return.
[451:56.63]And he does the beanbag Sonic dab thing.
[452:00.43]It's like an emote, but it's not an emote.
[452:01.69]It's like a little... with the parentheses and stuff.
[452:05.37]Virtual monster novel.
[452:06.73]Yeah, there you go.
[452:11.26]I don't think there is a beanbag Sonic in this game.
[452:13.48]The beanbag monster I don't think exists.
[452:15.98]It might.
[452:16.40]Maybe we'll unlock it.
[452:19.06]We'll have to see.
[452:21.06]Something or other, thanks for the 250.
[452:22.49]If you fused rumor with your dog, would it be called the automobile?
[452:29.89]Yeah.
[452:31.74]Probably.
[452:33.02]That's a good one.
[452:36.46]Thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the 250.
[452:37.58]Just $2.50.
[452:37.72]Thank you so much.
[452:45.56]Uh, Felix, thank you Felix Felis for the five dollars.
[452:48.48]Hey Jeremy, I know how much you liked the last jermaCorn, so I had a few people on the Discord make some more variants.
[452:55.03]I just know one of these has to be a new emote.
[452:57.37]jermaCorn for life.
[453:01.05]Oh my god.
[453:01.97]Okay, the second one is jermaMustard.
[453:16.89]The first one is wild.
[453:18.43]I like that first one.
[453:23.91]They're all great.
[453:26.66]They're all perfectly nightmare-inducing.
[453:36.20]That's a good Jeremy Got Scared emote, isn't it?
[453:43.89]The last one is really good.
[453:44.97]Yeah, but the... The last one is just Jerva Disgust, but on corn this time.
[453:54.82]Thank you for those.
[453:55.50]I need to have... I got more slots.
[454:00.62]I gotta do a lot of artwork stuff for this channel.
[454:03.74]We need more stuff.
[454:06.62]Those are all great, though.
[454:12.23]Uh, thank you Manboy for the $2.50.
[454:13.73]Wanted to share this image that Kroskynail... Oh, Krosky, no.
[454:21.25]Uh, made after discussion in the sub-Discord.
[454:26.50]The Fire Family.
[454:35.54]This is awesome.
[454:39.61]Fire Grandpa.
[454:40.55]Look at Baby Fire.
[454:41.85]This is great.
[454:50.78]Fire Dog.
[454:53.34]Uh, Fire Dog had better have that hair on his tail.
[454:58.34]You know, that's a perfect place for it.
[455:05.24]That's wonderful.
[455:08.45]Thank you, Crowscanale.
[455:15.82]Those are wonderful.
[455:26.64]All of those are just so charming and wonderful, thank you.
[455:31.26]Feroidian Weapon, another $2.50.
[455:35.22]No message, just $2.50, thank you.
[455:39.66]Easy Pants.
[455:41.24]Thank you for the $10, Easy Pants.
[455:43.89]Hey Jeremy boy, I hope you had a great time streaming today.
[455:46.31]Quick question.
[455:47.77]Any tips on getting fit and exercising?
[455:49.89]I want to start living a healthier lifestyle.
[455:52.41]And any advice would be appreciated.
[455:56.25]Easiest advice is drink more water.
[455:59.53]Cut out some of the bullshit that you're eating.
[456:01.03]And I know I had to make the jokes about the fucking cereal bullshit.
[456:04.94]But in all honesty, cut out all like the sugary fucking Gatorade drinks you drink and all the sodas
[456:15.01]You wouldn't believe.
[456:17.15]With just like removing like two shitty drinks a day.
[456:21.03]If you're drinking them.
[456:23.27]Get rid of energy drinks.
[456:24.91]Don't drink those fucking things.
[456:26.73]Drink coffee.
[456:27.45]Just drink like black coffee instead.
[456:31.16]Or even like a little bit of cream.
[456:32.04]That's fine.
[456:36.00]Drink more water.
[456:38.06]Cut out some of the bullshit.
[456:42.00]Eat more fish.
[456:44.62]That's, I'm serious.
[456:46.56]That's a meme on this channel, but it's for real.
[456:53.19]Coffee's bad for your sleeping schedule.
[456:55.29]Well, if you don't, don't drink coffee after like 7 or like 6 p.m.
[456:59.45]If you drink coffee at like, you know, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock in the morning, that's fine.
[457:05.60]I mean, I've been drinking coffee for years.
[457:08.28]And my sleep is terrible, so don't listen to me.
[457:14.16]Go for a walk, yeah, and move around too.
[457:17.24]Don't let your body just be like complacent and just sit.
[457:21.28]Sitting is actually so bad for you.
[457:23.30]It just is.
[457:25.50]You put more compression on your spine when you sit down than when you do anything else.
[457:32.30]Just move around.
[457:34.62]Take a little walk, 20 minutes a day.
[457:37.42]Not even.
[457:38.58]20 minutes every couple days.
[457:39.52]Take a walk.
[457:42.88]Seven and a half hours of sitting.
[457:44.44]Yeah.
[457:45.52]And you know what I'm going to do tomorrow?
[457:46.98]I'm going to take a walk.
[457:50.40]I'm going to get up and I'm going to fucking do two push-ups.
[457:52.96]Because that's all I can do.
[457:55.52]But for real.
[457:57.88]I do two miles a day and honestly I've never felt better.
[458:00.02]There you go.
[458:03.64]Just stay active.
[458:04.50]And staying active doesn't necessarily even need to... You don't have to go to the gym and lift 250 pounds in a bench press.
[458:11.04]You don't gotta go to the gym five times a week.
[458:14.52]Stuffed as simple as just being active is so good for your health.
[458:26.38]Consistently active helps.
[458:37.19]But thank you, EasyPants.
[458:38.03]Hopefully some of that helps you.
[458:41.81]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[458:44.07]Garfield the Monday Killer!
[458:45.11]Hello, Garfield.
[458:46.43]Thank you for the five dollars.
[458:49.23]Five dollars?
[458:50.49]Back to back here.
[458:52.61]Another Monster Rancher sure does bring back memories, doesn't it, Jerma?
[458:55.09]Remember when I began donating all my Garfagraphs the day that Beanbag Sonic was born?
[459:01.31]That is where you came from, isn't it?
[459:02.95]It feels like the only... Yesterday, Garfield started donating.
[459:07.15]Monster Rancher 4 is actually how I got familiar with this series Jerm.
[459:11.05]I had a floating rabbit with a mallet as one of my monsters.
[459:14.48]It warms... It warms a cat's heart seeing a Jerma and his pets.
[459:18.46]I'm getting all teary-eyed, Jerma.
[459:20.60]All this emotion, and I don't even have a Jerma anniversary gift.
[459:24.95]That's alright.

[459:32.30]Yeah, it's called, I'm going out with my girlfriend.
[459:36.54]For real, not joke.
[459:37.86]That's right, hope you like it, maybe even show it on stream.
[459:44.50]You don't have to show it on stream.
[459:45.72]Okay?
[459:46.02]Took me about a month to do.
[459:56.98]Hope you like it.
[459:57.66]Hang it on your wall.
[459:58.68]You must hang it on your wall.
[460:00.42]I'm just garfing with you, mate.
[460:02.24]Also, I want to thank Chat for being there and my mother back at the Italian restaurant.
[460:08.74]Happy Garfursery, Jerma.
[460:09.96]Let's see.
[460:10.30]Here it is.
[460:16.67]There's a lot of Garfields.
[460:19.47]Why does Garfield have a Miss Piggy puppet?
[460:21.49]I don't understand that.
[460:32.01]There's a penis?
[460:32.87]Oh, no there's not.
[460:34.67]Oh, fucking god damn it, don't even say that.
[460:39.78]Where?
[460:50.13]Do you see how easy this is?
[460:51.85]I can't fucking link shit anymore.
[460:54.85]I know, okay, there isn't, there isn't, but, like, hey, link, link!
[460:58.33]Hey, hey, there it is!
[460:59.75]Here, oh, link this, please, yeah, sure!
[461:04.37]I gotta fucking have a screening process.
[461:12.06]But thank you, Garfield.
[461:13.84]That's wonderful.
[461:15.26]You can try.
[461:15.94]I can trust Garfield.
[461:16.82]I can.
[461:18.68]KXZ501, 10 bucks.
[461:20.41]They say victory bits.
[461:21.31]Thank you.
[461:23.49]Thank you, KXZ.
[461:23.97]For the $10.
[461:25.77]Much love to you.
[461:31.29]Garfield, we trust the Flintstones.
[461:33.22]We don't.
[461:34.96]Oh, that was awful.
[461:37.60]Oh, I have nightmares about that scenario.
[461:43.60]That was so fucked up.
[461:53.71]We don't even talk.
[461:54.35]We don't have to talk about it.
[461:55.27]We're going to bury that.
[461:58.29]Tingy thanks for the 250.
[461:59.03]Oh, no, I dropped some money.
[462:01.42]Sherp.
[462:01.92]Oh, fuck.
[462:02.34]Oh, no, the vacuum sucked up my bits.
[462:04.91]Sometimes.
[462:09.35]Hey Silverflame, thanks for the $2.50.
[462:10.61]Hey Jermasally, I'm not part of the mafia and can't donate hundreds of dollars, but here's some money.
[462:17.18]Thank you regardless.
[462:18.52]Anyhow, today is my birthday.
[462:20.18]Getting drunk and watching your streams is a great way to spend it.
[462:22.72]You're my favorite entertainer in the world, bro.
[462:24.76]Keep doing what you're doing because both me and hundreds of others love it.
[462:28.18]And you smooches.
[462:29.74]Bye.

[462:33.34]I hope you enjoyed your night.
[462:34.30]Happy birthday.
[462:36.95]Hope you didn't drink too much.
[462:39.52]But it's always nice to kick back a few and hang out and watch some streams.
[462:46.04]Or stream.
[462:46.62]You know, I drink on stream sometimes.
[462:49.34]You've seen it?
[462:56.75]There's dozens of us out here.
[463:00.11]You got drunk on cooking wine.
[463:01.51]Yeah.
[463:02.45]Because I wanted to drink it.
[463:08.37]Thank you MaskedHeroMan for the $3!
[463:10.98]The other day I sent you this video, I forgot to mention how long it was, but I have the part I actually wanted you to see here.
[463:17.00]Hopefully you like it.
[463:18.52]It's a lot shorter since 21 minutes of 2D Movie Maker is hard to stomach.
[463:34.26]Let's see.
[463:35.56]Where is this?
[463:41.80]Oh, this is not going to play, is it?
[463:43.66]Because I have this connected to my... Can you guys hear this?
[463:46.50]No, I can't.
[463:51.57]I'm through my PlayStation 2 right now.
[463:53.33]Let's see if I can hear this.
[464:02.94]Can I hear this?
[464:08.71]What was it?
[464:09.25]Oh.
[464:10.85]A slice of deep space moon fight.
[464:13.05]I can't believe you've done this.
[464:20.28]Do you want to see me turn into a Super Saiyan?
[464:24.66]Turn into a what?
[464:35.47]now it looks like I'm a super saiyan again there's no visual yeah well you guys have to figure out what's going on bring out this power but you killed flurgy and I can't be dealing with that he's too strong
[465:01.83]But I'll have to beat him for Fergie.
[465:05.26]Who's Fergie?
[465:11.26]Time for you to taste my final punch, big bastard.
[465:19.75]Oh, hey, that's kind of scary.
[465:20.93]Punch!
[465:23.09]Yeah!
[465:38.70]Hey, that was fucking crazy.
[465:40.72]That was a fight on the moon Somebody said they were too high for this relax no more The music's from one punch man, yeah it is Well this makes much more sense
[466:10.15]Thank you, Master Hero Man.
[466:13.92]For your, uh, 3D movie maker.
[466:17.12]Animation.
[466:18.44]Sorry for making you watch that.
[466:20.20]Why?
[466:20.52]What?
[466:20.78]No, it's fine.
[466:24.54]Some of those animations are really dumb.
[466:26.34]Some of that shit takes a long fucking time in this program.
[466:28.94]Which you guys don't understand.
[466:32.93]Some of those, like, explosions and hand beams.
[466:36.61]That's a lot of processing power for Windows 95 to handle.
[466:42.05]But thank you, Master Hero Man.
[466:46.35]And just the frame-by-frame that you have to do to make that with, like, balls and sticks, it's hard to do.
[466:56.03]Hey, Jess, you got it.
[466:56.84]Thanks for the $2.50.
[466:57.62]Here's to fun to your lucky charms.
[466:58.96]I'd eat that, too, if I wasn't too lazy to put in the time it takes to pick out all the marshmallows.
[467:05.92]Alright, I got you.
[467:08.26]Somebody in chat actually was, like, really upset about...
[467:11.89]And I kind of felt bad.
[467:12.59]They were just like, why would you do that?
[467:15.40]Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[467:16.74]What a waste of food.
[467:17.84]Like, are you really that fucked up?
[467:25.94]It was me.
[467:33.66]Why would you do that?
[467:34.46]I agree with that guy.
[467:35.36]Yeah, I know.
[467:39.61]But thank you, Jesse.
[467:40.51]Got it.
[467:43.48]VRJosh, thanks for the $2.50.

[467:51.92]Only breakfast and dinner.
[467:53.77]But it makes me brush my teeth.
[467:54.63]I'm going to have real clean teeth.
[467:57.55]Thank you for the $2.50.

[468:27.93]We're going on UTC plus 8.
[468:31.01]Thank you for the $2.50, though, Sad Vega.
[468:32.93]Pika Banana, thanks for the $2.50.

[468:35.31]Thanks for watching.
[468:38.95]I'm going to get the credits rolling here.
[468:40.39]They're probably going to go pretty fast.
[468:43.35]Because there was a shitload of community subs tonight.
[468:47.52]There were, I think, like 400 or 500 almost community subs, which is insane.
[468:53.72]So let's... Oh, look at that.
[468:57.81]Can't even see them go by.
[469:02.11]That's high-speed subs.
[469:10.66]Thank you, everybody that subbed and resubbed, all the community subs, you guys.
[469:15.05]You guys are too much.
[469:15.79]Thank you.
[469:17.79]And while we see this extreme amount of people that have subscribed to the channel tonight, remember when you used to read these?
[469:24.11]Yeah, I do.
[469:35.58]Oh my god, that's insane.
[469:37.96]Try and read them now?
[469:39.62]Okay.
[469:40.02]No, impossible.
[469:43.08]Not possible.
[469:50.37]Thanks for the $10.
[469:51.33]Hello, Jeremy.
[469:51.69]Just a reminder to try In-N-Out since you're on the West Coast.
[470:03.27]I have had internet a few times.
[470:05.51]Also, I'm craving some skate from you in the future, hopefully.
[470:08.33]It's probably not going to happen.
[470:14.28]For your fitness comments, one way to get in good shape is to find a really fun active hobby like rock climbing.
[470:18.80]That's true.
[470:21.10]That is true.
[470:29.33]Getting a hobby that makes you move around.
[470:31.86]It is good for you if you can get into something.
[470:34.87]Absolutely.
[470:40.41]But yeah, I've had In-N-Out.
[470:43.25]It is good.
[470:48.66]It is a good little joint to get a quick berg.
[470:52.20]I will say.
[470:53.50]The subs are still going that fast.
[470:55.28]I can't even fucking... How many subs is it total?
[471:00.85]752 subs this stream total let me see what do I but okay oh my god yeah because I was at 40 I was at like 4900 subs like a two days ago or something or 5100 or 4900 or something
[471:32.03]Holy shit.
[471:32.69]Yeah, that's... I'm... I'm... 1 trillion emotes unlocked.
[471:38.12]49... No, 4... Like, 4,900.
[471:42.08]Not 49,000.
[471:42.38]That's fucking crazy.
[472:04.42]Yeah, if you guys remember from like three or four months ago, we almost crossed, I think we crossed 7,000 subs from a bunch of gifted subs and a bunch of like sub trains.
[472:19.99]And I was at 4,900 last week.
[472:27.79]Yeah, there was a point where it came down, but I was up at fucking seven goddamn thousand subs.
[472:36.37]At least for a little while.
[472:37.49]It was there for a while.
[472:50.71]Absolutely fucking insane.
[472:53.85]Thank you, everybody.
[472:56.65]Still a couple more bits to do but as you speak that was just be for the ten bucks and talking about internet Surgill, but thanks for the five dollars and ten cents.
[473:07.55]Hey Jerma I've been super sick for a while now and your VODs plus this stream has been keeping me alive Anyway, here's a quick interesting question for you What's the scariest?
[473:15.93]Oh shit.
[473:16.43]This is gonna get my channel banned moment.
[473:18.09]You've had on stream Keep up the good work the Flintstones thing Apps definitely
[473:31.17]Because that was like actual like weird fucked up porn that like I linked to.
[473:38.86]So it wasn't on the stream, but I like linked to a page that had it on there.
[473:52.09]So it definitely was that.
[473:56.33]When did this happen?
[473:57.01]I don't know, like a year or two ago?
[473:59.03]When was that?
[473:59.51]That was like a year ago.
[474:01.06]It was from some, yeah, it was from like a wiki page, like a McDonald's wiki character page.
[474:15.23]When was this?
[474:16.09]It was during Red Dead 1.
[474:16.95]That was a long time ago.
[474:18.13]That was like more than a year ago.
[474:22.40]But thank you, Sergio, but we were just talking about it.
[474:28.66]Jerma lied about 5K subs.
[474:30.01]Thanks for the $2.50.
[474:30.85]I would have a sub if you didn't lie.
[474:32.61]It was April Fool's.
[474:33.39]I'm just kidding.
[474:33.95]It was an extreme, crazy thing that I said that didn't mean anything.
[474:39.25]Because it was April Fool's.
[474:50.40]Why is it...
[474:53.25]Why does that L-U-L look different?
[474:58.12]There's this L-U-L, there's two L-U-Ls, one looks like weird.
[475:06.22]Oh, that's okay.
[475:08.20]That's the B, that's the B-T-T-V one.
[475:10.72]I was like, did they change that right now or something?
[475:12.95]That's the old one, right, okay.
