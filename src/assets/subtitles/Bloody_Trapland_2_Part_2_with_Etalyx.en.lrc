[00:21.14]There we go.
[00:21.72]Finally.
[00:24.84]Okay.

[00:51.96]God damn it, man.
[00:54.20]Like, I fucking get so... I get so frustrated when shit like that happens.
[00:58.78]I really do.
[01:03.26]Yep.

[01:36.87]I'm part of a botnet now?
[01:38.43]God, no.
[01:41.25]I'm in my fucking tirade there.
[01:43.80]I think I missed a few things.
[01:45.48]Let's see.
[01:46.76]I did.
[01:47.04]I did.
[01:52.44]Thank you, too.
[01:54.48]Never trust purple.
[01:55.06]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[01:56.00]I just got back.
[01:56.58]How long is the connection dance going on for?
[01:58.54]Not the whole time I was gone, right?
[01:59.74]I think it was.
[02:01.17]The whole time you were gone.
[02:05.14]I imagine you get frustrated, but I tend to find the technical mishaps entertaining, and I think a lot of others do, too.
[02:09.66]I hope so, guys.
[02:10.88]Like, I don't want a, like, shitty technical mess stream, and we've been getting a lot of those lately.
[02:16.83]There's been, like, we've been getting a lot of those.
[02:20.83]Where shit, like, just don't go well, and, like, shit goes out of hand.
[02:26.75]More so than ever, and, like, I've been trying to get much more prepared recently.
[02:33.00]Like I said, I bought a lot of things.
[02:36.66]It says, game does not exist.
[02:38.46]Game does not exist.
[02:39.98]I'm sorry.
[02:40.46]I'm sorry.
[02:41.04]I was trying to make it work.
[02:42.46]Hold on.
[02:44.78]Make sure I'm in the correct region.
[02:47.71]Invite friend.
[02:48.35]I don't know why it has me at C. What is C-A-E?
[02:58.67]What the fuck?
[03:01.80]Hold on.
[03:05.39]C-A-E.
[03:06.55]What did you just do?
[03:07.92]Just do it backwards.
[03:08.98]Steam invitation.
[03:10.16]Join game.
[03:10.66]Play.
[03:17.24]Hold on.
[03:20.88]Region.

[03:22.00]East.
[03:22.32]Okay.
[03:22.76]Hold on.
[03:23.62]Were you in the wrong region?
[03:25.52]We didn't have an option to pick that last time.
[03:28.30]True.
[03:32.04]My patience is wearing very thin!
[03:36.74]Not like this.
[03:38.54]And get in there.
[03:41.08]And get in there.

[03:53.29]Hang on, hang on.
[03:54.63]I see your game in the... Yeah, do you?
[03:57.61]Yeah, I see.
[04:01.21]I see the game.
[04:02.15]Do you see it?
[04:02.69]Do you see it?
[04:04.31]Can you join it?
[04:05.53]Can you join the game?
[04:09.01]I think so.
[04:12.92]Hallelujah.
[04:15.22]Hallelujah.
[04:16.38]Let's go.
[04:17.46]Let's go.
[04:17.92]I'm ready.
[04:19.04]I'm going to talk like this permanently for the rest of this stream.
[04:24.15]Ugh.
[04:24.75]Okay.
[04:25.89]Oh dear.
[04:28.07]Let's head over to the ice world.
[04:29.03]What's with those frames?
[04:30.99]What do you mean?
[04:31.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:32.47]What do you mean, what's with those frames?
[04:34.49]There.
[04:34.71]I was getting, like, five frames per second when you were moving the boat.
[04:38.29]Okay, you scared the shit out of me.
[04:39.31]I thought you were talking about my stream was, like, fucked up.
[04:40.87]No.
[04:42.59]Aye, aye, aye.
[04:43.08]Alright, we're going to, uh, wasn't there, like, one thing that we never got to do, though?
[04:47.88]Well, we got to go to the ice world.
[04:50.44]We can do Ice World, then we'll check the secrets.
[04:52.72]We didn't do this, this is where we left off.
[04:55.52]You want to do just the first one over again?
[04:57.22]Sure.
[04:57.48]Just to complete the package.
[04:59.02]So how did, uh, Tokidon go?
[05:00.59]It went awful.
[05:02.77]It was awful!
[05:04.27]They missed a great stream.
[05:06.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, shh, everybody shut up.
[05:09.09]I'm deleting that VOD, that VOD is not gonna exist.
[05:12.69]Did you turn it off?
[05:13.63]What is killing me?
[05:15.64]Oh.
[05:16.02]Yeah, we never played that game, I'm deleting the VOD.
[05:20.65]It doesn't exist anymore.
[05:22.55]I'm deleting.
[05:30.99]This is the best game that you could play after getting insanely frustrated.
[05:37.08]I know.
[05:38.78]This is not the game to play when you get frustrated at something else.
[05:43.92]This is not the fucking right game.
[05:45.24]You're already so mad.
[05:49.23]This is the one.
[05:50.13]You want to play bloody trap play.
[05:52.01]But this is like fun mad.
[05:53.17]This is not real mad.
[06:00.03]I'm the red guy.
[06:00.55]Remember, this is a double jump.
[06:01.31]Don't forget that.
[06:04.11]How do you do that again?
[06:05.33]Oh, that was close.
[06:06.95]What?
[06:07.17]What?
[06:08.66]Wait.
[06:09.18]Hold on.
[06:10.56]The double jump is just X, Etalyx.
[06:12.88]It's just X. It's just X. I feel like a mother scolding me.
[06:21.08]That's going to kill me.
[06:21.84]I don't know what to do here.
[06:28.77]I freaked out.
[06:29.27]And I'm dead.
[06:32.51]Can't wait for me to get fun mad.
[06:39.19]How do you get a... Oh, you have the wall jump.
[06:40.39]You get a wall jump and then you get to do the glide.
[06:47.38]Is it just me or is the music on this level particularly annoying?
[06:51.94]Like Charlie Brown Christmas special.
[06:53.52]Is it just me or did we beat this level on the first try and now we can't do it?
[06:56.98]We have a lot of practice though.
[06:58.52]We did have a lot of practice.
[06:59.74]Don't kill me.
[07:01.45]Play late shift?
[07:02.77]No, I played late shift.
[07:04.23]I'm not redoing all of late shift again.
[07:08.91]How do you... Wow!
[07:14.72]I don't get how to do the wall jump thing.
[07:18.15]Okay.
[07:21.85]The drums are the guns, yeah.
[07:31.48]Okay, we're dead.
[07:32.38]Done.
[07:32.98]We win.
[07:33.42]Thank you, because I can't do it.
[07:35.24]I'm off to a really bad start.
[07:38.41]Maybe we'll do that this weekend.
[07:44.45]Oh, alright.
[07:45.27]Level two.
[07:48.19]What?
[07:49.03]What?
[07:50.91]What are you talking about?
[07:53.39]Congratulations.
[07:55.21]I thought you said... No, no, no, no, no.
[07:57.68]That's not true.
[07:58.78]It's there?
[07:59.42]No, it's there.
[08:00.60]Is it there?
[08:01.08]Yeah.
[08:02.24]Okay.
[08:03.18]Yeah?
[08:04.20]Okay.
[08:05.02]Yeah.
[08:05.38]Alright.
[08:06.62]Just kidding.
[08:07.48]Prank.
[08:08.68]I would have been fucking mad.
[08:10.14]You've been pranked.
[08:13.76]I would have been real angry.
[08:15.46]We would have had to play late shift.
[08:18.14]Hold on, what's this?
[08:18.96]What am I doing right here?
[08:19.76]I don't know.
[08:21.26]Do you see where I am, though?
[08:22.95]Like, it's like I'm holding onto a ledge.
[08:24.53]Yeah, there's a little lift there.
[08:27.71]How do you do that, though?
[08:29.07]I've never done that before at all, period.
[08:30.21]How do we beat this level?
[08:31.63]We never played this level.
[08:33.08]I mean, but how do you do it?
[08:34.84]Oh.
[08:36.50]Okay, I guess you have to just be perfect.
[08:44.41]This is gonna be Jerma's favorite part right here.
[08:48.15]The perfect glide.
[08:50.01]I can't wait to delete this bot.
[08:54.95]Guys, I didn't even stream on Thursday.
[09:00.94]How'd you do that?
[09:07.22]Okay, I can make that one consistently now.
[09:12.06]Except for the- the- the wall jumps, so we're going from the perfect glide to the perfect wall jumps.
[09:19.30]You just killed me.
[09:28.19]Wait, where are you landing?
[09:30.19]You just landed on the ground.
[09:32.51]Yeah, they've got like a- there's like a new mechanic.
[09:34.93]Remember I was asking how I was sitting there?
[09:38.09]There's- the new mechanic is like hanging on the wall.
[09:42.21]I can't even make that jump, though, to get there.
[09:48.01]I just... Dude, that was such a huge fucking PogChamp shit.
[09:52.54]I just launched you up there.
[09:54.04]You jumped off my head.
[09:55.08]That was incredible.
[09:56.62]I didn't even see that.
[09:57.74]That was such a huge P-O-G-C-H-A-M-P.
[10:02.02]I alley-ooped you.
[10:03.10]What'd I just find?
[10:05.20]Some fake spikes?
[10:08.07]I can't make this jump to save my fucking life.
[10:11.06]Where am I?
[10:11.50]I don't know, but I can't do this.
[10:13.90]You just got a coin.
[10:14.42]No, where am I?
[10:15.02]Uh, I don't know, but you got like a gold coin.
[10:23.59]Okay, I figured it out.
[10:26.69]These gotta be pixel perfect?
[10:36.08]Okay, good.
[10:43.13]Got it.
[10:43.49]Okay.
[10:44.11]Don't fuck this up.
[10:45.79]Where are you?
[10:47.25]Look at me.
[10:49.18]Alright.
[10:52.14]Come on, Etalyx.
[10:52.80]We don't have time to mess around.
[10:53.94]What the... I just got a snowball thrown at me and it killed me.
[11:03.63]No, we don't have...
[11:11.21]Why did that not just kill you?
[11:12.55]Oh, what are you doing?
[11:14.23]What are you doing?
[11:15.81]Why did you die there?
[11:17.13]You knew the secret that you're gonna get hit.
[11:18.99]At least I can do this consistently now.
[11:29.88]We never fucking streamed this game either.
[11:32.00]Hey guys, I was sick on Thursday.
[11:39.71]I was really sick.
[11:41.82]He was.
[11:43.92]It's true.
[11:46.19]Sick of you guys.
[11:47.13]I was so ill.
[11:55.89]I'm going mad.
[11:57.73]Sorry.
[11:58.43]Sorry I'm losing my mind.
[12:00.01]That we had another technical mess stream that should've been fucking completely avoided.
[12:05.51]Sorry.
[12:05.87]It's okay though, because it's all fixed now.
[12:11.73]All you gotta do is make this jump.
[12:13.25]Just don't get hit by the snowballs.
[12:16.89]What is even down here?
[12:19.82]That's very, very odd because the noise is happening and it's happening after the noise.
[12:25.80]That's why this is still in development.
[12:27.66]Yeah, it's okay.
[12:29.41]So, there's a cannon over here.
[12:33.19]Oh my god.
[12:36.59]Jesus.
[12:38.51]I'm dead.
[12:41.10]I died in the water.
[12:41.66]You freeze in the water.
[12:46.76]I can't even get past that part of the level.
[12:48.26]There's got to be a secret here.
[12:50.30]There's a secret thing right there.
[12:51.68]Do not stand in the fucking water.
[12:55.62]It fucking kills you.
[13:01.32]What the fuck?
[13:02.84]I jumped over it.
[13:03.26]I was going to wait here for you.
[13:05.72]If only I was playing the late shift instead.
[13:12.12]Guys, come on.
[13:13.06]This was an emergency backup.
[13:16.04]We had to play this.
[13:21.59]Okay, I think I'm safe right here.
[13:23.79]I'm just gonna wait for you.
[13:27.99]What are you even supposed to do?
[13:29.69]He's gonna run across.
[13:33.96]But doesn't the cannon track your movements?
[13:36.98]Oh my... I didn't touch you!
[13:39.12]I didn't touch you!
[13:40.32]Oh.
[13:40.54]My.
[13:41.70]God.
[13:41.96]Go watch, quick, open it, open it, open it, open it, open the screen.
[13:44.99]I didn't touch you.
[13:46.85]I'm watching.
[13:48.67]I landed on the platform.
[13:51.12]Giant hitbox.
[13:54.20]I did it.
[14:02.21]What killed you?
[14:02.81]Falling ice.
[14:03.87]There are falling transparent icicles.
[14:05.81]Uh-huh.
[14:09.82]I made it through, too.
[14:10.96]God damn it.
[14:13.72]How do you... I'm gonna watch you next time you get to the cannon.
[14:16.60]I don't... I just... I fucking just... I swear to dude, I can't even talk.
[14:22.06]I am more angry... There's more anger than blood in my body right now.
[14:29.14]You go first.
[14:30.90]You're good.
[14:37.15]Oh my god.
[14:38.15]What are you supposed to do there?
[14:40.05]You gotta go down there when it's on the right.
[14:41.59]I just like fucking fell off.
[14:43.39]I slipped off.
[14:44.85]There you go.
[14:52.48]There you go.
[14:52.94]Now watch out because the icicles fall right there.
[14:59.02]I tried to warn you.
[15:00.20]I tried to tell you.
[15:03.20]I saw them.
[15:03.72]I just didn't know what to do.
[15:04.86]Okay.
[15:10.08]You slip around so much here.
[15:11.70]Okay.
[15:13.22]We're good.
[15:19.11]My last death was pretty good.
[15:23.93]Nobody tell me what.
[15:25.11]What happened?
[15:27.39]What happened?
[15:28.01]Why didn't nobody tell him?
[15:30.68]What are we nobody telling me?
[15:32.56]Hey, look.
[15:33.24]We beat the current early access version, Ian.
[15:36.40]Oh, no.
[15:36.70]Don't even tell me that's going to keep doing that shit.
[15:40.42]As long as the next level unlocks.
[15:43.74]That's all that matters.
[15:46.90]Nobody tell him.
[15:47.54]What happened?
[15:50.95]Shush.
[15:51.35]Don't say anything.
[15:52.07]No telling.
[15:52.57]Quiet.
[15:54.93]What is going on?
[15:55.69]Is something going on in my stream, Etalyx, that I don't know about?
[15:58.31]I have no idea.
[16:00.19]What happened?
[16:04.59]I have no idea what's happening.
[16:06.77]Hold on.
[16:14.88]Uh... What... Am I missing something here?
[16:19.58]Can you figure this out, Etalyx?
[16:21.59]Uh, I cannot.
[16:22.77]I saw that there were some random numbers, like 3, 4, 2...
[16:27.62]Three fourths two.
[16:29.31]Being typed in the chat.
[16:31.47]Are they talking about level three being it?
[16:33.79]They better not be.
[16:34.33]Alright, let's let, let's let, we gotta get this beat.
[16:36.53]Because I need to know if this is the case or not.
[16:40.26]Are you ready?
[16:41.66]First try, don't fuck around.
[16:43.36]Do not fuck around and go.
[16:45.16]We have to beat it right now.
[16:48.90]No deaths.
[16:49.66]Not kidding.
[16:50.30]If you die once, then I'm going to be really mad.
[16:52.11]No deaths.
[16:52.55]No dying.
[16:53.47]Well, then I'm going to let you go first.
[16:54.85]No, you go first.
[16:55.63]It's my stream.
[16:58.91]There's a secret underneath to your platform.
[17:06.16]That doesn't count as a death because it's a funny, friendly fire streamer killed the streamer death.
[17:12.82]Okay.
[17:14.38]Ooh.
[17:14.54]Ooh.
[17:19.95]Oh, I'm so mad because we died.
[17:22.95]I haven't had a fair chance yet.
[17:24.49]This is my first attempt.
[17:25.85]Okay, you go.
[17:28.17]I'm blue.
[17:28.57]He's red, by the way.
[17:31.97]Watch out for those falling spikes.
[17:33.69]Don't go that way.
[17:35.53]Oh, no.
[17:37.27]I can't stand up.
[17:38.95]Can you push me?
[17:40.74]Push me.
[17:44.34]I can't move.
[17:44.84]You have to shove me.
[17:46.18]You're going to slide and push me.
[17:53.65]And then maybe I'll be able to get over there.
[17:56.49]How did nobody tell him?
[18:00.79]Buddy, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[18:06.72]Okay, slide.
[18:10.02]I can't.
[18:10.72]How do you slide there?
[18:14.48]Doesn't make any sense.
[18:17.78]He will never guess this.
[18:19.50]You know what?
[18:19.86]Forget that.
[18:22.56]Oh, God.
[18:23.14]And I stood up.
[18:25.76]Why is my face... My facecam isn't on.
[18:27.62]I can see the preview window right next to me.
[18:37.05]God damn it.
[18:45.10]It's too good.
[18:47.26]I don't get it.
[18:47.82]Neither do I.
[18:52.32]I'm trying to figure out how you would do this.
[18:58.81]Oh my lord.
[18:59.43]Okay, I'm not going that way anymore.
[19:01.37]I'm going this way.
[19:02.51]Hold on, I got an idea.
[19:04.67]How the hell are you supposed to do that?
[19:09.13]I got an idea.
[19:13.44]Okay, it's not a great idea.
[19:15.18]I don't know if that's going to work.
[19:37.49]Please!
[19:39.29]We're not supposed to start on the hardest courses in the game.
[19:42.13]Yes, we are.
[19:44.16]That's what we're doing.
[19:45.34]We had so much practice with the first three worlds or however much there were.
[19:49.26]Now we're jumping in after like two full weeks.
[19:55.17]It's alright.
[19:56.43]There.
[19:57.91]Look, you made it.
[19:58.55]Trapdoor.
[19:59.27]Trapdoor.
[20:00.11]Watch out for the trapdoor.
[20:01.97]You're not going to tell me to watch out for the trapdoor because I'm not going to make it through this.
[20:09.66]Um...
[20:11.95]If you could make it through, I think we can cheese this sector.
[20:14.53]You think so?
[20:14.89]Dude, I can't wait for fucking Dinosaur Week.
[20:29.30]Can I just tell you that?
[20:30.02]It's gonna be so much fun.
[20:32.84]What are we cheesing?
[20:34.83]I think that they don't want you to know that R9K mode got turned off.
[20:40.45]Is that what it is?
[20:42.11]I don't know.
[20:42.59]That's just a guess.
[20:43.89]So how are we choosing this?
[20:47.04]If one of us can boost the other one up.
[20:49.68]What happens?
[20:55.30]Huh?
[20:56.17]I'm so confused.
[20:59.93]It's a black screen?
[21:00.81]It's not a black screen!
[21:04.35]If it is, then it's not my problem.
[21:08.97]Alright, ready?
[21:09.37]Alright, jump on top of me.
[21:14.81]I'm dead.
[21:17.79]You're supposed to jump.
[21:19.17]That didn't work as intended, but it's okay.
[21:25.99]No, I can't.
[21:26.65]Good luck.
[21:27.87]What are you supposed to do?
[21:28.99]You've got to slide under that, and then you've got to jump.
[21:32.31]Like, oh, okay, okay.
[21:36.12]Good luck to you.
[21:36.54]I hope you succeed.
[21:38.81]It was a good try.
[21:39.39]It was a good first attempt.
[21:42.06]Oh, look what's back on.
[21:43.30]I'm sorry.
[21:44.44]I did this.
[21:45.30]Wow, I'm just not a good person today.
[21:47.92]I had it.
[21:48.96]I had it and I freaked out.
[21:50.04]I had it and I freaked the fuck out.
[21:54.23]Everyone's going to hate me now.
[21:55.39]Like, is he turned off?
[21:57.91]Now R9K's back on.
[22:01.19]Because I said something.
[22:02.47]I'm the rat.
[22:07.88]342 LOL.
[22:09.98]Is that because you could write 342 over and over again?
[22:15.41]Can you buy me Half-Life 2?
[22:16.45]No.
[22:16.91]I own Half-Life 2 already.
[22:17.91]Thank you.
[22:18.20]Alright, we got our first secret coming up here.
[22:24.20]Next level.
[22:33.92]Interesting.
[22:36.44]Something about bloody Trapland has brought out the spam.
[22:39.29]I'm gonna warm up next to this thing.
[22:45.11]And then go again.
[22:49.58]Oh wow, you die so quickly in this water.
[22:56.84]Don't tell, what were you doing that for?
[22:59.81]I'm trying to find... There's a secret up here.
[23:01.77]The pieces look weirdly put together.
[23:03.90]No, there's no secret.
[23:05.80]I can promise you.
[23:07.18]Listen, there was this... You don't understand.
[23:10.18]Go, go.
[23:14.22]You're dead.
[23:18.06]I think you can actually make that, though.
[23:22.64]I didn't even touch you.
[23:29.79]Okay.
[23:31.85]Then what?
[23:36.07]Are you supposed to just hit stop there to warm up?
[23:37.73]Oh, no, no.
[23:38.11]Okay, yeah.
[23:38.61]You're just supposed to stay here to not freeze.
[23:50.55]Ah!
[23:51.79]That was a little too... What?
[24:02.52]Because my ice cube came back down and smashed you that's why alright here we go Trying to cheat I want to make it to the next deck point first You can't really do it.
[24:19.04]Holy shit.
[24:20.80]Oh
[24:25.40]Oh, that was actually really tricky.
[24:26.70]Hopefully nothing appears out of nowhere and kills me.
[24:31.18]I got it.
[24:31.90]No, something's gonna happen here.
[24:34.38]Something is gonna happen right here.
[24:35.38]I'm not prepared for this, Dalek.
[24:38.81]Something's gonna drop.
[24:39.73]Like an icicle's gonna kill me right here.
[24:41.27]Don't do it.
[24:42.87]Don't do it, game.
[24:45.13]Okay, good.
[24:46.05]You're just gonna have to beat all the levels.
[24:51.25]There's definitely a secret there.
[24:52.28]There's a minecart on top of that level for some reason.
[24:56.76]Yeah, there's a minecart there for some reason.
[25:00.94]Alright, there is an actual secret level here.
[25:02.72]Yeah, this is the real deal.
[25:06.84]Dinosaur week, or game show week, it looks like it's going to be one of those two.
[25:09.79]It's going to be starting on Tuesday.
[25:14.55]That's troll.
[25:15.09]That's so troll-y.
[25:17.13]So is that.
[25:17.79]Oh my god.
[25:21.24]God.
[25:22.64]Is there a pattern or does it just pop up?
[25:24.87]It's just whenever you step on it, I guess.
[25:26.97]I don't know.
[25:27.63]There's ones under here too.
[25:29.19]Careful.
[25:30.73]Oh, there are.
[25:31.41]They're under like all the ice cubes.
[25:33.33]Alright, I made it through that.
[25:36.47]Slide underneath this?
[25:41.13]Left or right here?
[25:45.29]Um, okay.
[25:47.02]So what happens if you walk left?
[25:51.27]I died.
[25:53.99]I'm dead.
[25:55.10]Okay.
[25:57.92]Secret.
[26:00.64]You found the secret?
[26:01.18]Are you telling me that's not a secret right now?
[26:03.74]I found an area just like that earlier.
[26:09.15]And it seems like there's something you can do there, but I really think it's just the map being screwy.
[26:14.01]That's weird.
[26:17.87]Whatever.
[26:22.42]Why is my facecam still on?
[26:23.84]Dude, guys, my facecam ain't even plugged in.
[26:31.64]You can't catch me with that one.
[26:33.80]Everybody should just ask.
[26:35.98]I'd like to see a fucking couple of PogChamps for that one.
[26:38.32]I would love to see it, please.
[26:40.58]Thank you.
[26:43.43]How did you make that?
[26:46.25]You know, I would really love it if people could just show me a fucking little bit of respect right now.
[26:53.37]I'm making demands.
[26:56.69]Now where do I go?
[26:58.99]I should not be up here.
[27:01.23]This doesn't make sense here.
[27:02.43]Making demands.
[27:05.42]Why are you just floating?
[27:06.86]No, no, no.
[27:12.16]Respect.
[27:13.34]I was looking at the red guy.
[27:15.48]So, how do you... You do this.
[27:19.00]Can you slide to the lower right where the cart is?
[27:24.58]Hold on.
[27:25.48]What are you trying to attempt here?
[27:30.75]Okay.
[27:32.07]Okay.
[27:33.05]I see what you did there.
[27:34.03]Shortcuts.
[27:34.97]Shortcuts.
[27:35.39]I'm going to do this.
[27:36.81]Because this is the end of the level.
[27:38.41]I'm dead.
[27:45.21]What?
[27:45.47]Of course it's Piranha.
[27:48.53]What?
[27:49.19]What the fuck was that?
[27:53.53]What the fuck was that?
[27:57.73]Where is the end of the level?
[27:58.76]It's got to be... It's got to be the minecart.
[28:00.46]I don't know.
[28:04.68]How are there two exits here, then?
[28:06.70]Where's the exit?
[28:08.26]Where's the actual exit?
[28:09.42]I don't... I don't know.
[28:10.56]That's a good question.
[28:13.40]What if you can't beat this level?
[28:15.06]What if that was the secret?
[28:16.62]That's what everyone was making fun of us about.
[28:18.32]And saying 342.
[28:18.60]Maybe this is... Maybe level 3... I don't know.
[28:32.08]Oh my god, I'm losing my mind on this one now.
[28:35.96]Oh my god!
[28:38.94]Jump off the boulder into the cart.
[28:41.93]Okay, jump the boulder.
[28:44.81]How the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[28:46.19]Are you supposed to slide and fall down with it?
[28:52.98]Can you even do that?
[28:55.48]Hold on.
[29:02.96]I don't know if that's necessarily possible.
[29:08.44]It certainly seems impossible.
[29:12.84]Oh, wait a minute.
[29:13.40]Okay.
[29:14.12]Yeah, it is possible.
[29:15.02]But holy shit that you slide on this thing.
[29:17.98]Got it.
[29:19.94]Wow.
[29:20.78]Wow.
[29:23.60]What does that do, though?
[29:26.08]I just dropped a coin in here.
[29:29.26]You did the thing?
[29:30.52]I guess I did the thing, but where's the other exit?
[29:33.41]Is this the secret secret or the actual exit?
[29:37.55]I don't know.
[29:38.29]The level feels incomplete.
[29:41.29]It might be.
[29:44.72]What if we unlock the level above or the level to the left?
[29:50.72]Or level five?
[29:52.04]Which one were we just on?
[29:53.40]We were just on level five.
[29:56.30]That's not a good sign.
[29:57.48]Uh-oh.
[29:59.79]Is that the secret?
[30:00.81]Wait a minute.
[30:03.60]wait a minute minecart right didn't we like unlock that uh yeah but how did there's no way to get up there um right um
[30:31.47]Oh, boy.
[30:32.07]Hang on.
[30:32.65]Are you sure?
[30:33.33]Because I never saw the news that the Ice World was done.
[30:38.29]No, yeah.
[30:38.81]It said, go play Ice World.
[30:40.51]It's ready to go.
[30:41.87]Let me see.
[30:43.33]I'm going to read the patch notes.
[30:45.29]Move them down.
[30:45.85]This patch is from April 16th.
[30:50.59]Yeah.
[30:56.21]Says, we've also went ahead and unlocked all levels for World 3.
[30:59.01]That's right.
[31:00.19]Even though much of them are still very much work in progress, they should be a fun challenge while we polish and tweak them.
[31:05.18]Right, see?
[31:06.94]So how do we, like... How do we do this?
[31:09.36]You know what that has to have been?
[31:11.26]That has to be how you get to the secret, but the secret level's not done yet.
[31:16.12]Maybe.
[31:16.38]So we're supposed to find the actual exit to go to the next level.
[31:18.96]So where is the actual exit?
[31:21.35]That's my guess.
[31:23.03]What if it's this, Jerma?
[31:28.17]That would have been pretty funny.
[31:34.41]This is the exit, right?
[31:35.51]This is, like, really weirdly blocked for some reason.
[31:40.10]Like, look at this.
[31:40.74]This is weird.
[31:45.16]This is kind of weird, right?
[31:46.92]Why is there a water?
[31:51.28]Your guess is as good as mine.
[31:54.67]I'm going to go over here on the left.
[32:03.97]okay it's not this way I tried the water there's nothing down there hold on what about okay hold on whoa what what why what the hell does that accomplish
[32:36.27]People are saying, what about the Christmas tree?
[32:37.70]The Christmas tree is weird looking.
[32:39.28]Why does it have a little medallion on it?
[32:41.44]It's a good question.
[32:42.40]What is that?
[32:45.32]Remember you said you dropped a coin in something earlier?
[32:47.54]Yeah.
[32:48.14]Does it have anything to do with that?
[32:50.12]Let's find out.
[32:52.69]Does that snowman throw a snowball at that thing and break it?
[32:58.63]Hold on.
[33:03.61]Come on.
[33:04.37]Really.
[33:04.88]Please.
[33:06.99]What on Earth, man?
[33:10.24]Maybe I can get him to... I don't know.
[33:11.84]I don't... I don't... I don't know.
[33:19.75]I wish I had an answer for you.
[33:20.95]It says they've unlocked all levels.
[33:22.67]Like, there has to be a way to beat this one.
[33:25.73]What about having them throw the snowball at the thing on the right?
[33:27.88]Why is it, like, weirdly frozen thing there?
[33:33.70]um can you get up to the snowman I'm like this fucking dumb ass dash man seriously oh here we go here we go it's begun I'm trying to get him to like throw it at me okay like it's like the thing's blinking right shut electricity up it's it's definitely blinking yeah it's got electricity no that's weird alright
[34:10.65]The rage is starting to fester.
[34:13.65]The frustration... I wouldn't even call it rage, I'd just call it like, what the fuck is this level?
[34:19.71]What are you doing?
[34:22.61]What was that?
[34:23.07]I don't know.
[34:24.55]Why could you just walk on the air?
[34:26.15]I don't think that should be a thing.
[34:28.51]I wanna try it again.
[34:31.62]Hey, what's that?
[34:39.45]How you doing up there?
[34:40.29]You can't throw this way.
[34:41.15]Alright, I... He's gotta throw the... break the... frozen chain.
[34:47.64]Which does something.
[34:49.78]He does not turn the other direction, I just tried.
[34:53.46]He will not turn and face me when I go that way.
[34:57.04]What happens if you just walk left?
[35:00.65]He died.
[35:04.73]Good try.
[35:06.07]Jump to the boulder when it drops.
[35:07.45]We already did the Minecraft thing.
[35:09.29]Minecraft we hope we opened up that we did that with that coin is and we walked over there and end of the level And it didn't do anything We already did Jerma craft dude.
[35:19.19]We did do Jerma craft to alright I like I Wish there was something else we could do there.
[35:29.57]What about like just okay crying on approach.
[35:31.15]What's up here?
[35:31.81]Do you see this?
[35:32.73]There's like mystical glitter snow on top of this thing there is oh
[35:38.46]Unless that's the default snow animation.
[35:40.38]I'm gonna try to get over there.
[35:41.68]Try to get over there and crouch at the Christmas tree.
[35:43.16]Okay.
[35:55.24]I'm at the Christmas tree.
[35:57.10]I'm ready to see... Uh-huh.
[36:01.53]Go on.
[36:01.97]Christmas tree just fucking electrocutes you.
[36:04.61]Oh.
[36:06.61]Um... So it's just another regular old hazard.
[36:10.67]I guess it's to make it so you can't... You can't sit there and, like, cheese it.
[36:15.30]There's some... Why is there a buzzsaw up here is what I'm trying to figure out.
[36:20.90]Like, I already went over here and I can't do anything.
[36:23.84]What if you go up on top of the middle part?
[36:26.31]I already tried that.
[36:27.23]There's nothing up here.
[36:27.87]There's nothing here.
[36:34.98]Developer!
[36:36.08]Hello, developer!
[36:37.12]It would make sense to be able just to walk right down there, down right, right?
[36:40.41]Yeah.
[36:40.87]Hold on.
[36:42.59]Should we just try to go... That's why it's all blocked off.
[36:53.48]Now we can't even get past the first fucking thing.
[37:01.06]Okay, like, here we go, right?
[37:03.26]Yeah, you've already done that.
[37:04.28]Complete the level.
[37:06.15]You've already done that.
[37:07.05]I know, but maybe it just, like, fucked up and we had to make it do it again.
[37:16.13]And... Go.
[37:20.92]Nothing.
[37:24.24]Nothing.
[37:25.62]Um...
[37:28.55]Kind of running out of, uh... Kind of running out of options.
[37:32.11]Yep.
[37:33.40]I would agree.
[37:35.48]They had to have playtested this, though, at least to beat the level.
[37:38.66]Yeah, well, you can go in there, but it doesn't really do anything.
[37:41.10]Hold on, let me look at the comments.
[37:45.13]I 342'd you guys again.
[37:46.13]What the fuck does that even mean?
[38:00.26]Are there, like, cheat codes for this game?
[38:02.56]I don't think so.
[38:05.00]So you can't end the level that way.
[38:06.92]Why?
[38:07.35]Why?
[38:07.71]Whoa!
[38:08.19]Hey!
[38:09.13]What?
[38:09.71]I just walked to the left and I ended up down here.
[38:12.13]I know!
[38:12.59]But if you go all the way left, you just die.
[38:14.75]There's like a fake... There's a fake wall right there.
[38:18.89]What is the point of that?
[38:22.65]I don't have the slightest clue.
[38:24.57]Has anybody, like, on the community thing said anything about it?
[38:30.79]Um... The actual patch notes have two comments.
[38:34.97]One says, Thanks.
[38:36.45]And the other one says, Great work.
[38:37.75]Thanks for unlocking World 3.
[38:38.77]Uh-huh.
[38:39.59]Uh-huh.
[38:43.28]So, uh... Um... Looking like it's gonna be one of those days.
[38:50.74]Why does this keep fucking popping up?
[38:51.97]Like, this wasn't happening.
[38:52.81]This shit wasn't doing this before.
[38:56.63]Is it really just one of those days again?
[38:58.82]I feel like it's just one of those days.
[38:59.86]One of those fucking days again.
[39:02.90]Why am I not reading chat?
[39:03.66]I read chat all the time.
[39:09.30]Seems like one of those days.
[39:13.74]I feel like the exit is absolutely supposed to be... Right there, right?
[39:18.54]Why don't you just try going that way one more time?
[39:21.10]I can't.
[39:21.56]I have to hit the invisible wall.
[39:26.68]So you try it.
[39:27.92]How do you get over there?
[39:30.83]You're supposed to, like, jump underneath it, or what?
[39:35.47]Oh, you fall, and then you jump, and you grab it.
[39:37.39]Hold on.
[39:40.41]Read 3-4-2 aloud.
[39:41.87]3-4-2.
[39:44.75]Oh, this invisible wall?
[39:45.99]Yeah.
[39:46.75]And you're gonna die.
[39:47.17]You go over it, then you die.
[39:48.79]It's like the exit's been blocked off.
[39:53.99]What happens if you, like, try to fall down?
[39:55.26]No, it's...
[40:02.40]Why is this here?
[40:04.70]What purpose does this thing serve here?
[40:06.88]I think it's so that once you get through the axe, you have somewhere to land.
[40:09.84]I guess.
[40:11.49]I feel like you're supposed to go top left to the slide thing, through the axe, through the double spinny axe, and then to the right.
[40:22.81]Wait, what are we doing?
[40:26.36]Just looking at something.
[40:41.56]Wait, are you putting in 342 as a code?
[40:46.08]That would be... You know why they're doing that, right?
[40:50.08]Why are they doing that?
[40:51.22]They're doing that because earlier, I saw like a few numbers and I said, I don't know what they're doing.
[40:56.99]They're just writing like 3, 4, 2.
[40:59.99]And then now everyone's writing 3, 4, 2.
[41:02.45]So that doesn't mean anything?
[41:04.25]So they just pranked you, basically.
[41:05.77]I'm just getting pranked.
[41:07.09]Guys, I'm already on edge right now.
[41:08.69]I'm already on edge today.
[41:10.11]We can't even get through level 5 because the game doesn't work.
[41:13.70]And then Takedan was all fucked up and like made me really angry.
[41:16.78]You know, I'm on edge right now.
[41:19.16]Don't do this to me.
[41:20.28]I'm already on edge.
[41:23.80]How do we beat this level?
[41:25.89]How do we get the fuck out of this?
[41:28.47]I can't find a single YouTube video of people playing this game.
[41:32.55]You can't find somebody beating level 5?
[41:35.27]Bloody Trapland 2.
[41:37.46]Bloody Trapland 2.
[41:38.82]Ice level.
[41:39.24]Curiosity.
[41:39.78]Level 5.

[42:10.04]I'm doing my detective work right now.
[42:12.54]Somebody's got to have done it.
[42:17.65]Where am I?
[42:18.07]I apparently died.
[42:29.59]What?
[42:30.89]What happened?
[42:31.61]I don't know.
[42:33.77]I don't know.
[42:36.31]Why did the game make a noise?
[42:38.67]I beat the level.
[42:40.69]Nuh-uh.
[42:41.25]It's still locked.
[42:43.13]I did it!
[42:43.53]What?
[42:44.67]Yeah, the levels are still locked.
[42:46.03]What the fuck?
[42:46.79]I just beat it!
[42:48.09]What did you do?
[42:48.87]I don't know, but I beat the level!
[42:51.67]Uh, can you do it again?
[42:54.64]What the fu- I went up here.
[42:56.88]Yeah, I went up there too.
[42:59.48]And I- I freaked out over- down-
[43:18.37]I was just wall jumping up here and I ended the level.
[43:23.04]Yeah, I told you.
[43:23.72]Wouldn't it be cool if the end of the level was up here?
[43:25.94]And apparently it is.
[43:27.54]Why the hell did that happen?
[43:39.81]That's all I did.
[43:46.18]I'm still going.
[43:47.00]Still jumping.
[43:47.43]I'm dead.
[43:52.29]Well, I mean, we've gotten the you completed the level thing, like, fucking three, two, three times now.
[43:58.25]Nothing is open.
[44:03.39]Like, this space doesn't make any sense.
[44:11.24]It might be time.
[44:12.50]You think it's time?
[44:13.78]It might be time.
[44:14.32]Is it time to just call this stream a wash?
[44:19.26]You mean in total or for this game?
[44:21.18]I don't know.
[44:23.62]Because the only other options I can think of are the other two things I mentioned earlier.
[44:34.16]Well, that was the least we tried.
[44:44.67]Time to play the late shift.
[44:47.77]No, not tonight.
[44:51.27]Not tonight.
[44:56.80]Well, how desperate do you feel?
[44:59.48]I mean, this has been just about three fucking hours of total nonsense.
[45:04.76]Kind of like mentally exhausted right now about all this dumb shit.
[45:17.76]Why don't you see how Chat feels?
[45:19.44]How does Ch- Well, Chat- I know what Chat feels.
[45:21.63]Chat wants you to play Late Shift.
[45:22.87]Alright, I'm like up here.
[45:24.41]How was that, by the way?
[45:25.47]It was fucking hilarious.
[45:27.43]There's nothing I can do there.
[45:28.05]Can't go in there.
[45:34.11]I think Ice World is awash, sadly.
[45:37.24]Well, let's just go down here and see if there's anything else.
[45:41.74]I doubt that there is.
[45:47.68]um alright here's I want to try one thing let's like leave the game like just I was gonna see if it's like level six is unlocked maybe it's like a lag thing stream got put on ice
[46:09.45]New comment on patch notes.
[46:10.55]Seems like there's no exit on level 5.
[46:12.01]World 3 can't progress.
[46:13.09]Okay, well, apparently that's a problem.
[46:14.73]Apparently we're not insane and it just can't be level 5 right now.
[46:17.63]Are you sure that that comment didn't just get put there in the last 10 minutes?
[46:21.91]May have.
[46:22.53]I don't know.
[46:23.85]It's like by someone in chat.
[46:26.05]It's possible.
[46:31.99]Let's see if they changed this.
[46:37.17]Yeah, that comment was from 6 minutes ago.
[46:40.43]Somebody here wrote that.

[47:40.24]Seems like a game Unitalix might like.
[47:41.60]We really should fucking play that game.
[47:44.38]I don't really know much about it, honestly.
[47:45.86]It seems to be fun.
[47:49.26]uh front row seats thank you for the five dollars great Monster Hunter stream here's some disposable income well that was a terrible Monster Hunter stream he got we did hunt one monster we hunted one monster and we couldn't do it and it took an hour and 20 minutes to do that yeah but yeah I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this one a wash guys uh-oh
[48:13.96]I mean, like, this... We just did technical messes over and over again.
[48:18.44]Technical problems.
[48:19.84]Ah, it's a darn shame.
[48:20.88]It's a darn shame.
[48:21.82]It is.

[48:32.97]It's gonna be so fucking awesome.
[48:35.57]No more of this try-to-play-a-game-and-game-breaks-and-sucks halfway through.
[48:44.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[48:45.86]Okay.
[48:46.42]Okay.
[48:47.84]Mm-hmm.
[48:48.74]I'm going to do late shift again.
[48:50.70]Tonight.
[48:51.44]Oh, boy.
[48:52.22]It's going to take like an hour.
[48:54.08]Oh, boy.
[48:55.38]We're going to do late shift.
[48:56.52]We're going to try to get the good ending.
[48:59.72]I wish that I could watch you play that one-to-one.
[49:03.17]Yeah.
[49:05.01]I don't think it's possible.
[49:06.21]So, late shift.
[49:07.29]We're going to have... He caved.
[49:11.27]Yeah, I caved because, like, this is, like, two fucking games in a row.
[49:15.18]Like, we just can't play them.
[49:17.30]Like, what the fuck?
[49:19.54]Why does this shit continue to happen to us, Etalyx?
[49:23.54]That's the risk of new Steam games these days.
[49:27.95]I guess, right?
[49:29.01]There's, like, games come out, game don't work.
[49:33.15]yeah over and over again it's kind of to be fair the only one I would say is defensible is uh is bloody trap land because it's still technically in early access whereas yeah it's okay the other game we tried to play is a full 60 release and it's done it is
[49:55.40]I wish you could watch this and, like, help me make decisions, but... Yeah, give me a... Thank you.
[49:59.66]By the way, this has been a... Hey, this has been, like, three hours of awful stream.
[50:04.78]Technical mess stream.
[50:05.86]It's been really, really great.
[50:07.38]I mean, to Talcs, if you'd like to stick around, you're more than welcome to, but if you, for some reason, decide to leave, thank you for coming.
[50:13.38]Thank you for playing.
[50:14.83]I can stick around.
[50:16.11]I just wish that I could, like, watch you and influence your decision.
[50:20.39]Yeah, so we're gonna do some different decisions this time.
[50:22.31]We're gonna.
[50:22.55]We're not gonna be idiots Etalyx you can be you can be there help.
[50:25.67]I'm gonna.
[50:25.95]I'll just straight up ask you Okay, like questions.
[50:28.73]Okay, so only problem is what I see is like 30 seconds behind what you see that's okay I'm gonna shout a decision to you, and you have to make it oh Alright, give me a minute I'm gonna go take a pee break and we're gonna try to salvage this the stream if I playing late ship game that I played on to salvage it and
