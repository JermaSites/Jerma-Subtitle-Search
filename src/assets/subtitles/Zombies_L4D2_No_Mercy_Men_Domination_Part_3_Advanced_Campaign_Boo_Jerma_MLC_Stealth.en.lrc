[03:49.22]You better not.

[04:15.59]Play to win.
[04:16.86]It's all about the survive.

[04:31.42]Source mods is really good.
[04:32.52]Uh, hunted down here.
[04:35.20]Just a great engine.
[04:36.92]Oh, jockey's pulling me off.
[04:38.74]Oh, resist!
[04:39.80]Nice.
[04:42.60]I'd say so far, so good.
[04:43.61]Yeah, you'll have to tell me when we get a tank, because it's not playing the music for me.
[04:48.45]Maybe I turn the music down, I don't know.
[04:50.91]Yeah, we'll let you know.
[04:53.05]Yeah, the recordings come out pretty bad if you leave it, like, high volume.
[04:56.53]Hunter.
[04:57.92]Yeah, I've noticed that.
[04:59.06]With all Source games, I've noticed that.
[05:01.40]Well, I have to have it low just to fucking hear you guys.
[05:05.18]Whoa.
[05:05.62]Oh shit, sorry.
[05:07.22]Spitter up here.

[05:30.56]Yeah, I'm in cap up top too.
[05:32.92]Stealth!
[05:34.08]Am I the only person alive now?
[05:37.01]Oh no!
[05:37.35]Where's the tank?
[05:37.81]Where's the tank?
[05:38.23]I have a Molotov, he's on my body.
[05:42.01]Shootin'.
[05:43.13]Oh, can I get this off while he goes after Boo?
[05:45.49]And then go after and pick up Shimmy?
[05:48.80]Medic!
[05:50.03]We need to cover him in fire.
[05:51.55]Oh, Buddha's got rolled.
[05:52.97]Where is he?
[05:53.30]Where is he?
[05:53.60]Coming after you still?
[05:54.30]Yeah, take aggro still.
[05:55.46]Bait him.
[05:56.00]Bait him still.
[05:57.62]Oh, I know how to do that.
[05:59.01]Is he still being baited?
[05:59.85]Nice.
[06:00.13]Getting boo.
[06:01.03]Okay, I'm gonna try to throw a Molotov at him.
[06:02.62]I know parkour.
[06:03.88]Just let him chase me this whole time.
[06:05.22]Hardcore parkour.
[06:06.64]Oh, I didn't have enough ammo.
[06:07.80]Got him, got him, got him.
[06:09.40]Oh, I just got hit by the fire, shit.
[06:10.98]Now he's, like, pissed.
[06:12.06]He's coming after me.
[06:12.70]He's coming after me.
[06:13.38]Yeah, he was really calm before.
[06:15.36]Baiting him around, baiting him around.
[06:17.20]That's probably because he's on fire.
[06:18.30]Oh, shit, fire.
[06:18.82]Oh, shit, I'm going right through the fire.
[06:19.89]I don't care.
[06:22.13]Oh, now he's asking me.
[06:23.19]That's why you don't like fire.
[06:24.47]Hold on, bait him in the middle.
[06:25.37]Oh, my God, the minigun.
[06:27.29]And I just jumped off the building and took 44 damage.
[06:29.97]Oh, he's gonna throw it at you.
[06:31.17]Oh, I thought I could break it, like, with shooting it.
[06:34.69]He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[06:35.67]Good, nice, nice.
[06:37.27]Good recovery, good recovery.
[06:38.67]Alright, everyone grab fresh guns and all that.

[06:47.80]I'll try and get back up the roof if you can.
[06:49.60]Oh, boy.
[06:50.28]As you get up, I'll try and block it.
[06:52.62]I'm out of ammo.
[06:54.02]Roger that.
[06:55.06]Shit.
[06:55.88]I'm stuck down in the bottom.
[06:57.44]Get me up there.
[06:58.02]I'm throwing a pipe bomb.
[07:02.73]I have about zero ammo right now.
[07:05.59]And that's rounding up.
[07:08.27]Oh, see ya.
[07:09.07]Oh, no.
[07:09.31]I got you.
[07:09.57]I got you.
[07:10.01]I got you.
[07:12.73]Try and get me back.
[07:14.91]This helicopter has to be close.
[07:16.57]Oh, Hunter, oh my gosh.
[07:18.25]Oh, damn.
[07:20.07]Thanks.
[07:20.37]Got him.
[07:20.63]I don't know why I closed the door behind us when it's a half door.
[07:24.22]Oh, shit.
[07:27.30]You scared the shit out of me and I shot you and killed you.
[07:30.47]I got you.
[07:31.07]When you get up, heal.
[07:32.37]Oh, is that what I should do?
[07:33.37]Okay.
[07:33.99]Yeah, like... Mr. Chicken Finger in the mouth.
[07:37.03]Okay, could he, could he, like, throw nuts?
[07:40.00]I shouldn't, like, throw my health kit off the, uh, building.
[07:42.90]I should use that.
[07:44.30]Yeah, might be it.
[07:45.46]Oh.
[07:47.42]Oh, I'm being smoked.
[07:48.36]Thanks.
[07:48.56]I'm gonna throw my pipe.
[07:49.64]I don't have a pipe.
[07:50.84]Smoker's still alive.
[07:51.62]He just jumped off.
[07:52.28]I'm about to go down.
[08:02.37]Oh no, it's not.
[08:03.61]It's just a really fat common infected.
[08:09.06]You know, zombies are self-conscious, Boo.
[08:11.20]Yeah, we call them fluffy.
[08:12.90]We don't say that fat word.
[08:15.96]Egg.
[08:17.34]Egg.
[08:18.42]Oh, my.
[08:18.80]Help.
[08:19.86]I got him.
[08:21.59]Oh, good.
[08:21.91]Nice job, Jimmy.
[08:24.09]Alright, I'll bait the tank just because I'm gonna die.
[08:27.29]I'm gonna be done in two seconds.
[08:28.25]Alright, let's get a Molotov on him.
[08:31.45]I have one of those.
[08:32.83]So there's no pills or anything anywhere?
[08:34.23]I have- I don't.
[08:35.09]I have pipe.
[08:35.81]Oh, I just like missed.
[08:37.55]Are you serious?
[08:38.47]He's right underneath us right now.
[08:39.71]He's underneath.
[08:41.29]That wasn't even close to him.
[08:43.13]Oh yeah, have him chase you.
[08:43.77]Have him chase you.
[08:44.17]I'm gonna unload on him with a minigun.
[08:45.97]We have like 19 molotovs left.
[08:47.83]Oh, come on.
[08:48.31]I'll take the heat.
[08:48.89]I don't care.
[08:49.37]Kill me.
[08:50.33]He missed.
[08:50.87]He missed.
[08:51.21]What an idiot.
[08:51.77]Did I miss again?
[08:52.67]With a molotov?
[08:53.61]No, I'm just unloading on him though.
[08:55.73]Oh, he's dead.
[08:56.29]He's in the building.
[08:56.89]In the building.
[08:57.29]Oh no, he's not dead.
[08:57.99]He's up top.
[08:58.56]Up top.
[08:59.28]Oh, he's so mad.
[09:01.19]Alright, here's attempt number three with the Molotov.
[09:03.33]Whoa, you got me.
[09:04.20]I missed again.
[09:05.02]That's the third Molotov I've missed.
[09:06.96]This is the last tank.
[09:08.04]Let's try Molotov number four.
[09:09.78]I got him.
[09:11.94]He's dead.
[09:12.57]He's dead?
[09:13.83]No, he's mad.
[09:15.17]I got him with the Molotov.
[09:16.09]Oh, he's going to come bitch slap me off this building.
[09:19.11]Oh, watch out for that rock.
[09:20.15]Oh, that rock.
[09:24.79]Let's go take him up towards the ramp so we can get all spitter coming.
[09:28.53]Oh, he's dead.
[09:28.95]He's dead.
[09:29.31]He's dead Let's get out of here on the roof.
[09:31.95]Oh, let's get all four of us out of there.
[09:33.11]Come on still Come on, make it make it.
[09:35.79]I have faith.
[09:36.13]I have a pipe bomb.
[09:37.95]Oh, chargers.
[09:38.39]I'm trying to snipe the pilot out.
[09:41.17]The charger just jumped off the cliff.
[09:42.96]Snipe the pilot.
[09:43.96]Hurry!
[09:46.60]Yeah, we all have to get in it too.
[09:48.00]It doesn't just like cutscene.
[09:49.06]We often like jump in.
[09:51.33]I've always been scared of falling out the other side, just jumping and clearing the helicopter completely.
[09:55.11]There we go.
[09:55.99]All four.
[09:56.77]Oh yeah.
[09:57.09]That'd be such a bad way to die.
[09:58.67]Going through all that shit and you just jump out the other side accidentally.
[10:02.39]Oh god.
[10:03.87]Someone has a little extra slurm and you just slip.
[10:06.61]Oh man.
[10:09.20]What if a Spoker could just pull the tail of the helicopter in a crash?
[10:13.00]Good game.
[10:14.08]Tank throws a rock.
[10:15.42]And it actually counted?
[10:17.51]Like, oh sorry, you just got unlucky.
[10:19.25]So what actually happens in the story here, like how do they not get away with the helicopter?
[10:23.03]Like what's like the next campaign?
[10:25.27]It crashes or something?
[10:26.65]It runs out of gas and crashes, honestly.
[10:29.99]I think the pilot turns into a zombie and it crashes.
[10:35.25]Grab the reins!
[10:36.27]Pull up!
[10:40.32]Oh, well me and Boo know how to die.
[10:43.12]Seven incapacitations, that's great.
[10:49.69]Pain pills used?
[10:50.55]None.
[10:51.03]I don't take pain.
[10:52.07]I don't feel pain, bitch.
[10:55.46]And Elsie stealthed four molotovs.
[10:58.00]Oh yeah, and I missed the tank with three of them.
[11:03.36]No melee kills?
[11:04.06]I have no hands.
[11:10.17]Spitters?
[11:12.35]Least amount of damage?
[11:14.06]How do you see damage?
[11:15.36]Jerma sees damage.
[11:16.60]Dude, I took 1280 by 720.
[11:18.42]I got 720p in damage.
[11:22.00]Oh, I shot all of you, like, as much as possible.
[11:26.08]I like it.
[11:27.36]Look at that.
[11:27.70]Look at that.
[11:28.68]42% accuracy for Boo.
[11:29.64]Holy shit.
[11:30.50]Jeez.
[11:33.56]I thought I was supposed to be bad to the mouse.
[11:36.96]Should we switch to, like, play with subscribers versus?
[11:41.89]Yeah, why not?
[11:42.77]I'm down for that.
