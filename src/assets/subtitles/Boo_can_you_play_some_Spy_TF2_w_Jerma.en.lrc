[00:06.96]So this is a little bit ridiculous.
[00:08.90]I'm a spy.
[00:10.72]I'm behind their whole team.
[00:12.80]Like, their whole team.
[00:13.66]Two sentries, two snipers, two MGs, a medic, a heavy, a scout running through.
[00:18.17]There's so many.
[00:23.51]I'm going to need your help, Gemma.
[00:25.62]I don't know how to do this though, I'm not like quick on the keys, so I'd ask, what's the procedure?
[00:29.46]Sap sentry, backstab the engine.
[00:33.50]The best procedure is backstab engine.
[00:35.27]God, he's in a corner and there's millions of people around.
[00:37.07]I can't do this.
[00:37.83]This is impossible.
[00:38.91]You want to know this?
[00:40.65]Okay, so he's in a corner.
[00:42.31]Yeah.
[00:43.33]If he's in a corner, what you want to do is you want to sap the sentry, pull out the revolver and give him like two or three good shots, sap the sentry again by the time he hits the two hits necessary to take the sapper off, try to finish him off with one or two more shots of the revolver and then rinse repeat.
[01:00.55]You know what I mean?
[01:01.15]Like, bang, bang.
[01:01.85]There's so many enemies around.
[01:04.64]Oh, he's right in the corner.
[01:05.52]This is impossible.
[01:06.80]This is impossible.
[01:08.04]The best way to deal with that, do you have the ambassador?
[01:10.58]I do, yeah.
[01:11.76]Alright, what you're going to do here, Boo, you're going to pull up the sapper, pull up the sapper, sap the sentry, immediately pull up the ambassador, headshot the engineer, and then shoot him in the body.
[01:25.55]And then by the time he can react, get the sapper on the sentry again.
[01:30.82]Gonna take some skill.
[01:31.88]So wait, right, sap, oh god, it's like a medic, a heavy, a bunch of snipers, I think there's an enemy spy in here as well, right?
[01:39.83]My team is starting to come down, so maybe I can cause some havoc while there's a soldier here.
[01:44.32]You're looking for a sap sentry.
[01:45.64]If he's in a corner and you can't backstab him.
[01:48.68]A sniper just spy checked me.
[01:50.48]I've been standing here for so long.
[01:56.32]I can get this guy.
[01:59.00]Yeah, this guy's taunting.
[02:02.54]No!
[02:03.35]No, there's a...
[02:06.28]He was- this sniper was taunting after he shot someone because he was third person.
[02:09.36]He saw me behind him.
[02:10.32]What the hell?
[02:12.34]This is shit.
[02:15.34]Where's the plan?
[02:17.52]I'm gonna ubercharge you as a spy.
[02:19.08]You're gonna be an enemy spy and I'm gonna ubercharge.
[02:20.98]Are you like deliberately like knowingly ubercharging me?
[02:23.84]I'm deliberately deliberately going to ubercharge you as an enemy spy.
[02:28.50]Can you get on the other team?
[02:30.28]Um... Oh yes.
[02:33.05]Alright, tell me what you're disguising as.
[02:37.49]I wouldn't have a disguise until I have it.
[02:39.39]Oh, alright.
[02:40.59]I'm going to sit and spawn until you have a disguise.
[02:42.67]Alright.
[02:45.21]He couldn't Uber charge me.
[02:47.67]So, if I break my disguise by missing, does that, like, lose the Uber?
[02:52.73]Yes, I believe it does.
[02:53.59]Okay.
[02:55.77]Just make sure you don't backstab me.
[02:58.39]Alright, I'm going for the sniper on the right.
[03:01.50]Alright.
[03:04.23]Get him?
[03:04.97]Yep.
[03:05.89]Okay.
[03:08.09]Alright, sniper.
[03:09.54]What do you say we do some work here?
[03:12.10]You just changed into what's happening right now.
[03:19.93]Oh, what's wrong with that?
[03:21.07]Quick, disguise!
[03:21.69]Quick!
[03:21.87]Oh, I was gonna, like, quickly backstab someone so I could, like, put the beam on you again.
[03:26.89]Okay, I guess it does work, but if you miss, if you miss, it doesn't work.
[03:32.64]It's pretty much, yeah.
[03:34.32]I'm just gonna try to get four swings on an Ubersaw.
[03:36.32]I'm gonna try to find you.
[03:38.64]You, what?!
[03:41.00]That was such a backstab!
[03:42.82]What happened?
[03:44.26]I don't know, that wasn't even questionable.
[03:46.14]That was just a backstab.
[03:49.85]I was searching you with that sniper.

[04:20.01]I'm going for this medic right now.
[04:21.35]Please don't... I was hoping so bad.
[04:26.20]I was praying in my head that you weren't going to be hitting me.
[04:29.44]Okay, let me explain.
[04:38.73]Oh!
[04:45.75]Gemma, I'll need some help again.
[04:47.43]Build your uber faster!
[04:59.04]No!
[04:59.62]You crit me Medic!
[05:01.38]Shit!
[05:02.92]Say goodbye to all your stuff, Engie!
[05:06.49]Thanks, Engie!
[05:12.73]Oh, he has another crit melee!
[05:14.73]What is with these medics?
[05:17.70]Dude, medics have a lot of crits.
[05:18.82]What the hell?
[05:20.34]What is this guy's hat?
[05:23.42]What is it?
[05:25.40]I have no idea.
[05:26.96]It looks ridiculous.
[05:28.16]Look at how many arrows it took to kill this medic.
[05:32.36]A lot is the real answer here.
[05:38.42]But it's a great wrench!
[05:40.94]What?
[05:41.66]Whoa.
[05:43.09]You're naughty.
[05:47.91]We both had pretty outrageous things happen.
