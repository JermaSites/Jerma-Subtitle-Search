[00:05.27]Oh, there's no sound.
[00:07.59]Oops.
[00:08.61]Hey.
[00:11.09]That was awkward.
[00:11.79]Hey, hi guys.
[00:12.43]Welcome to the stream.
[00:17.00]You guys could just hear my mouth open.
[00:22.58]That's what it sounds like when there's no background sounds or audio.
[00:27.91]This is what you hear.
[00:39.84]That's, no, like, you can't hear that now, that this is on.
[00:45.15]Like, I just did it and you didn't hear it.
[00:47.87]Fucking magic of audio mixing.
[00:49.95]Anyways, uh, how you guys doing?
[00:51.21]Hope you had a good couple of days there after the green screen movie night.
[00:56.51]Hope all is well.
[01:00.59]My camera's on.
[01:01.95]Oh, better turn it off.
[01:05.30]So now we're gonna play Just Cause 4.
[01:08.31]And then tomorrow, if it's allowed, we're going to re-stream the Game Awards.
[01:15.54]And, you know, maybe give a couple of jabs every now and again.
[01:26.59]And then after that, the plan is for potentially this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, to be Dreamcast.
[01:35.97]Gonna get that ready to go if I can.
[01:41.67]So that is the plan for this week.
[01:49.07]Okay, but what about LEGO Island?
[01:51.43]All things... all things will happen eventually.
[01:55.91]It can't be LEGO Island every single stream.
[01:59.35]You know?
[02:03.30]I would love nothing more than to have it be LEGO Island every stream.
[02:08.74]But I'm sorry guys, it's just not the way it works.
[02:13.58]So let's move over here.
[02:16.31]Just Cause 4, it's just... I heard it was... interesting.
[02:21.73]That's what I heard.
[02:23.45]You know, might not be true.
[02:25.60]It's currently sitting at a very great, mostly negative on Steam.
[02:30.14]And I don't know why.
[02:30.80]But it is.
[02:33.76]And here it is right now.
[02:39.67]It's because it sucks.
[02:41.89]Alright, well, let's... Well, just how much does it suck?
[02:57.36]Just cause you can doesn't mean that you should.
[03:03.60]But I mean, look, we have to try stuff.
[03:06.88]Okay?
[03:09.72]This stream is a fucking first impressions journalistic approach to most video games, right?
[03:14.96]We have to do it.
[03:25.38]Former agency operative, Rico Rodriguez.
[03:27.58]Oh, the game is starting.
[03:28.74]Up to this point, his whereabouts have been unknown since our withdrawal from Medici.
[03:32.34]I thought that was actually loading screen.
[03:33.40]Responsible for deposing half a dozen heads of state.
[03:36.66]The Black Hand have encountered him before.
[03:38.26]Does anybody give a shit about any of this?
[03:39.32]I could just skip this whole thing, right?
[03:40.34]Where he assassinated our employer, President Salvador Mendoza.
[03:42.78]Yeah, I'm going to give you our own backstory here.
[03:45.31]We fought him again in Medici, where he overthrew Sebastiano Di Ravello.
[03:50.49]A real journalist.
[03:51.47]Though the agency had some involvement.
[03:52.75]This is his handler, Tom Sheldon.
[03:56.48]But we can't skip it.
[03:59.76]There is no skipping it.
[04:02.70]We have to sit here.
[04:07.15]So, first impressions of that cutscene was... There's animations in there.
[04:12.21]Hold on, this is so loud.
[04:14.71]I actually just skipped that.
[04:19.33]But how am I supposed to know what happens in this one?
[04:24.44]That's too loud.
[04:28.66]Yeah, you know, you got that right, chat.
[04:30.36]From my understanding, it's back and forth here.
[04:32.36]Between two forces.
[04:35.20]One red, one blue.
[04:37.14]Follow the waypoint.
[04:41.04]What kind of fucking system is this?
[04:43.08]Hold shift to aim down sights?
[04:46.88]What is run?
[04:50.95]You get to grapple?
[04:51.61]Wait, the grapple hook is immediately in the game?
[04:58.00]How do I suck to that?
[05:01.99]Come on, this is how the rock used to get strong.
[05:09.19]Attach me to like four cars.
[05:11.23]What do I have to do?
[05:18.38]Oh.
[05:18.54]Oh, by the way, his new show.
[05:20.12]Like, here come the Titans, whatever it's called.
[05:24.48]Jump off and pull the parachute.
[05:26.40]That's a big tower.
[05:30.59]I don't want to fucking wait for this.
[05:33.25]Reach the landing zone.
[05:35.35]Wait, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up.
[05:59.50]Just like in Mario, when you're in Mario World.
[06:02.49]Wait, I lost the momentum.
[06:04.25]No I didn't, I'm good.
[06:08.65]I got it.
[06:10.79]Okay.
[06:12.69]I made it onto the dish, that's what they wanted me.
[06:14.16]Okay.
[06:15.06]So I need to go follow the waypoint to the outpost.
[06:28.00]Why do I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to do this?
[06:29.62]Is this just cheating?
[06:32.72]I'm cheating in the game.
[06:34.41]I don't feel like I'm even playing a video game.
[06:35.75]Alright, we're going up here now.
[06:46.93]I'm so tilted.
[06:48.25]Wait, why?
[06:54.89]Does anybody else feel like they accidentally put me in a save file that was halfway through the game?
[07:00.36]Are these bad guys?
[07:04.02]Okay.
[07:09.52]Yeah, it's fucking easy!
[07:19.15]Yeah!
[07:20.57]God, I feel just like the Punisher in this game.
[07:33.65]How do I, can I grab?
[07:36.33]Is there a grab button besides that?
[07:39.37]So I gotta get a juggle here, right?
[07:44.37]Oh.
[07:45.24]Alright, well they're dead.
[07:46.38]Alright, so, uh, alternate fire.
[07:48.56]Release all tethers.
[07:51.56]Fire weapon.
[07:52.52]Alternate fire.
[07:53.42]Tap.
[07:54.62]Oh, well that's an explosive.
[07:56.06]Okay.
[07:57.55]This game sucks.
[08:00.39]We haven't even gotten through the halfway into the game tutorial.
[08:03.43]Come on, guys.
[08:05.15]This is what's gonna happen.
[08:06.49]Listen to me.
[08:07.17]I know exactly what's gonna happen with this game.
[08:10.36]We skipped the cutscene.
[08:11.20]We're in the middle of the game.
[08:12.92]Right?
[08:14.32]This is the flash forward.
[08:16.62]We're gonna go back.
[08:17.47]We're gonna have a melee weapon.
[08:18.43]We're gonna have a baseball bat and brass knuckles.
[08:22.50]This is gonna take us all the way back.
[08:23.98]We're playing a mission like, in the future!
[08:27.98]That's what this is.
[08:32.53]And I just took that out.
[08:33.61]That was so clean.
[08:36.83]Put a refund timer on the screen.
[08:39.09]Why would I do that?
[08:42.35]Okay, grapple and open parachute.
[08:47.39]Oh, you can fly around.
[08:48.39]Do I need to land there?
[08:55.93]Every bone in your body breaks right there.
[08:57.49]Alright, I made it to the giant speakers.
[09:00.77]I made it to my show.
[09:08.94]I can't just pull it out here?
[09:12.88]It really is the fucking Mario reference I made.
[09:16.08]You guys all thought that was nonsense.
[09:17.70]Alright, get up there.
[09:26.30]Okay, I've made it.
[09:32.87]Alright.
[09:34.01]We're fine.
[09:34.51]We did it.
[09:37.73]Wait, I was supposed to go up there and then jump.
[09:39.15]Okay, I know what I have to do.
[09:40.79]Bingo.
[09:42.15]And then fly over here.
[09:45.39]This is stupid.
[09:48.68]There we go.
[09:49.28]Just use the momentum from the ground.
[10:02.55]Are you sure this isn't modded?
[10:10.49]No, guys, I'm sorry.
[10:11.45]I downloaded Goofy Gravity Mod.
[10:13.48]That's my own fault.
[10:16.84]I'm at Project Yappa.
[10:18.96]Rico, there's a console further up this structure.
[10:22.26]Not sure how you'll... I'll figure it out.
[10:30.21]I don't know what I'm doing.
[10:31.59]Was that a person?
[10:34.21]Oh, I can drive?
[10:38.17]Does this car still work?
[10:39.39]Can I grapple the car?
[10:46.91]Use nitrous.
[10:55.43]I've almost made it.
[10:56.15]Come on.
[11:12.35]I feel like I'm playing Spider-Man.
[11:15.88]This is just the Spider-Man gameplay.
[11:17.46]I don't have any grenades left.
[11:43.95]I don't even know if I'm progressing.
[11:46.81]Oh, shit!
[11:47.76]Why did he just turn into the Cookie Monster?
[11:59.30]It's alright, I'll get up!
[12:08.28]Oh, cookies!
[12:24.39]I don't belong in this part of the game yet.
[12:29.33]The physics and the gravity just don't make any sense.
[12:33.38]How do I get that?
[12:54.86]It just is.
[12:55.64]There's too much going on right now.
[13:17.58]I need like a slow beginning.
[13:24.25]We're never gonna get out of the tutorial.
[13:25.81]We might not.
[13:30.23]Okay.
[13:30.87]There's a console up there.
[13:37.77]I'll figure it out.
[13:39.17]Why don't we just go to the structure, right?
[13:45.81]What did I just do to that person?
[13:47.37]Alright, I made it.
[13:54.90]Okay, that's what I had to do.
[13:59.90]And then jump off the edge.
[14:04.39]Let's go down, like, the portal level.
[14:06.87]Come on.
[14:12.56]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[14:15.98]Why would I... I'm...
[14:28.16]Get up there!
[14:29.98]Release the tethers.
[14:30.82]Get up here.
[14:31.62]And then I have to parachute because... I just did that shit.
[14:35.60]I just did that.
[14:36.60]You can't tell me I didn't.
[14:37.85]That's what I was trying to do.
[14:39.81]Alright, what are we doing over here?
[14:41.55]Oh, fuck.
[14:42.23]No, we're fine.
[14:43.09]Alright, we're good?
[14:58.97]The melee attack is Q, just for everyone that's curious.
[15:04.29]This way, we gotta jump.
[15:05.16]Okay, this is just like Mario, another Mario reference.
[15:07.44]This is from Mario 64.
[15:08.28]That's all we do in this channel is make Mario references, nothing else.
[15:15.04]We don't ever do anything else.
[15:19.42]When you land... Ooh, that went too far, man!
[15:28.63]Then get... Alright, breach the console.
[15:34.21]I gotta get behind cover.
[15:43.01]Is there a cover system?
[15:48.08]Look at those explode.
[15:48.84]Alright, I got it.
[15:53.46]Did I just say, what was that?
[16:02.66]Shoot the explosives, that's what I just did!
[16:07.76]See?
[16:10.29]Uh, who just gave a hundred dollars?
[16:11.65]Lorag just gave a hundred bucks.
[16:13.29]I don't have any more bullets left.
[16:20.00]Uh, what do you do if you don't have any more bullets?
[16:31.58]Alright, ammo!
[16:33.06]Get it!
[16:37.53]Shoot the giant exploding Disney balls!
[16:42.95]Alright, I did it.
[16:50.13]Anybody else?
[16:50.67]I think I'm safe.
[16:52.97]Hold on, let me get to a safe place so I can, uh, talk about it.
[16:55.76]I just got a hundred fucking dollars.
[16:57.06]Hold on.
[17:04.47]Up there.
[17:04.91]Watch this one.
[17:07.24]Can I get some hype in the chat, please?
[17:16.24]Wait, I'm on this.
[17:16.72]I'm on the structure.
[17:17.28]I gotta get off.
[17:22.03]You know, I always wondered... Why do you have to ask for hype?
[17:32.64]Alright, so we've reached the console.
[17:34.44]Alright, did I make it?
[17:39.76]No, it's over here.
[17:44.37]Alright, weapon case.
[17:47.67]What is this?
[17:49.35]Oh, a grenade launcher.
[17:51.25]What should I do with this?
[17:54.87]Should I take out the... do buildings fall down?
[18:01.60]I don't know what I'm doing.
[18:05.32]I have no idea what's going on.
[18:06.78]I have to hack this, okay.
[18:17.68]Oh no, not one of these.
[18:18.90]Make sure I jump before shooting.
[18:27.01]Now you're sure that I don't have mods installed.
[18:29.49]Are we sure about this?
[18:39.13]I didn't get like the deluxe edition, right?
[18:40.57]This person is freaking me out.
[19:12.34]Alright, remote hacking progress.
[19:19.14]Oh, they're on a super machine over there.
[19:24.99]Take your time.
[19:25.61]Don't take your time.
[19:26.45]I severely... Whoa, that was a grenade.
[19:28.65]I severely overestimated how far that was going to go.
[19:30.79]Well, underestimated.
[19:41.87]This is, um... I can't even tell you what I have to say.
[19:45.00]I did it.
[19:45.40]I made it.
[19:56.92]This is not an ordinary man, Senor Espinosa.
[19:59.40]See, now we're going to go back to, like, 1982 or something.
[20:05.74]Let's see what Project Yappa can do.
[20:08.50]Shall we?
[20:09.20]Senor.
[20:09.80]Uh, Lorac, thanks for the $100, by the way.
[20:11.48]I had a cold and wasn't feeling too good, then I watched the Greenspring movie stream, and not only do I feel absurdly healthy, I can see perfectly at night and do long division without a calculator.
[20:20.74]Thanks, Jeff.
[20:22.42]You're very welcome.
[20:24.86]You're incredibly well.
[20:26.10]This is a PS2 cutscene?
[20:26.96]Am I getting hit with explosions?
[20:29.16]He looks like, um...
[20:55.29]He looks like the mask.
[20:56.53]When the bad guy gets the mask on.
[20:57.87]What's that guy's name?
[21:01.17]What's that actor's name?
[21:06.69]I'm bonked enough.
[21:24.98]Quick rundown?
[21:25.86]Quick rundown on the game?
[21:28.32]It's fucking stupid.
[21:31.20]Rico.
[21:32.82]Rico, this is Mira.
[21:34.84]Please respond.
[21:41.59]Look at the ground.
[21:42.23]Look at the ground.
[21:42.63]It's even, like, moving around.
[21:44.51]That cement ain't fucking holding me.
[21:47.47]Come in, Rico.
[21:49.15]Please respond.
[21:53.62]Mira.
[21:53.78]Mira.
[21:55.73]Please respond.
[21:56.49]See?
[21:56.65]Now I have to start from zero again.
[21:59.41]See?
[21:59.67]I told you guys.
[22:00.51]You guys thought it was going to be a situation where we weren't halfway through the game.
[22:06.63]Alright, so that's all we need to know.
[22:09.79]Skip this fucking whole thing.
[22:27.22]I'm stuck.
[22:28.14]Visible cursor.
[22:29.12]Yeah, well that's okay.
[22:31.84]So all you need to know is... Okay.
[22:32.78]So now we have to go to meet Mira.
[22:34.16]Pigs!
[22:57.55]I can't do anything with the pigs?
[22:58.57]Why?
[23:01.93]I can't ride the pig.
[23:03.85]This could have been a full letter grade.
[23:08.61]Okay, well... What the hell are you talking about?
[23:22.94]Connect is dead.
[23:26.79]Okay.
[23:30.61]What is that?
[23:31.47]Thanks for telling me.
[23:32.71]That looks like the place.
[23:35.43]I'm no longer connected to the servers on this scene.
[23:37.84]Never seen anything like Yoppa before.
[23:41.42]Mira might be right.
[23:43.24]I do not want to move from this place.
[23:50.78]Everyone's dressed like a Pokemon trainer.
[23:52.26]Hey, good to hear from you.
[24:02.13]Don't have your graphics on low?
[24:03.49]The graphics aren't on low.
[24:04.77]What are you talking about?
[24:10.43]Two double-anthroposcopic filtering, 1080, fixa, high, high, yes, medium, and medium.
[24:23.43]What the hell is this thing?
[24:24.81]Is this like a bridge?
[24:31.52]I know you're not.
[24:33.36]I'm not, but I usually have a parachute.
[24:40.79]0%.
[24:40.81]0% what?
[24:44.79]What's on the phone?
[24:46.45]I wanted to see the phone.
[24:47.25]Alright, let's go.
[24:56.03]Glowing hair.
[25:03.89]This whole game feels like it was made in Second Life.
[25:09.44]Are you sure this isn't a modded version of the game?
[25:11.70]Are you certain of that?
[25:12.84]Take it from me.
[25:14.20]When you think of the essentials, you don't need much more than that, hermana.
[25:20.32]That would hurt.
[25:26.62]What happened?
[25:27.36]Everything okay?
[25:28.42]Fine.
[25:40.07]Oh yeah, I'm fine!
[25:41.87]I'm just fine!
[25:47.37]Things are going great over here.
[25:50.13]If you fall from that high and you land, you're going to disintegrate.
[26:01.47]Just fine for her, yep.
[26:07.32]Shit.
[26:07.90]There we go.
[26:10.93]I almost didn't make it again.
[26:11.87]Okay, easy now.
[26:19.86]Refund and get jo- Yeah, so this is second life.
[26:22.62]Where are the people with the elaborate, like, $400 animated dancing?
[26:29.58]That's what I'm worried about.
[26:31.42]Is that a dog?
[26:39.11]That dog looks very small.
[26:41.07]Doesn't it look undersized?
[26:42.27]Like it wasn't scaled properly?
[26:47.87]Can you pick up dog?
[27:06.92]It's kind of leaning to the left here.
[27:10.54]It's leaning to the left.
[27:12.84]I don't know.
[27:14.04]I don't think it's gonna make it.
[27:15.06]I don't think this dog's gonna make it.
[27:18.42]Oh, well, okay.
[27:26.99]It's smart.
[27:30.91]No, maybe it's not.
[27:36.61]Come on.
[27:37.90]Over here, I got something to show you.
[27:43.13]Let's find out just how smart you really are.
[27:44.75]Mm-hmm.
[27:56.52]Come on.
[28:21.21]Come on.
[28:21.55]Are you peeing over here?
[28:22.97]What are you doing?
[28:35.53]Oh, that's really cute of you.
[28:37.07]Good job, dog.
[28:40.07]Is there something else you want to do?
[28:41.34]You sure?
[28:45.68]No?
[28:46.14]Alright, fine.
[28:49.32]Well, you're very good at handstands, that's for sure.
[28:55.22]Oh, fuck.
[29:01.42]Alright, meet Miro.
[29:04.46]The dog was doing a dog T-pose.
[29:06.91]That is pretty accurate.
[29:18.78]Nowhere.
[29:24.38]Up here?
[29:24.70]Alright, here comes cutscene in 3, 2, 30 FPS cutscene.
[29:29.58]Yes!
[29:29.96]Yes!
[29:48.05]I'm being unfair.
[29:48.83]I think I'm being unfair.
[29:50.85]It's only been like fucking 20 minutes.
[29:52.82]Jesus fucking Christ.
[29:54.20]You could just hand it to me.
[30:13.03]Why would you boot the toolbox over here?
[30:14.95]Just hand it to me.
[30:16.92]We're in the same room.
[30:18.24]I agree.
[30:19.82]I'm saying I was wrong.
[30:21.94]You were right.
[30:27.30]Is that a distress signal?
[30:29.26]I didn't think you were with the agency anymore.
[30:31.10]Help me with this.
[30:35.17]Don't let him fool you.
[30:36.21]That's just an elaborate fucking Yu-Gi-Oh toy.
[30:38.19]What do we do about Iyappa?
[30:40.32]Between the Blizzard and those artillery towers.
[30:42.74]I can't get close.
[30:44.22]I have a couple of ideas.
[30:46.50]Tell me.
[30:47.68]Wait.
[30:48.90]Listen.
[30:54.06]Your actions in the next few minutes may determine the fate of this community.
[30:58.18]Choices matter?
[30:59.24]I am Commander Morales.
[31:01.88]I have tolerated el abismo for years.
[31:04.79]to maintain order and justice in Solis.
[31:07.98]This game is using the McDonald's Happy Meal engine.
[31:10.54]For the criminal and the disenfranchised.
[31:12.71]That's what somebody just said.
[31:13.89]Last night, a terrorist attack was launched against the Project Iyapa facility.
[31:19.20]The culprit was abetted by a conspirator from this village.
[31:23.16]Who is that?
[31:24.26]Gabriela.
[31:25.80]She killed my uncle when I was a girl.
[31:27.48]Is it my settings?
[31:28.32]Maybe I should turn some settings up or down or something.
[31:30.96]If Mira Morales is not surrendered to me immediately, I'll be forced to conduct an exhaustive investigation.
[31:38.92]Every home will be searched.
[31:40.59]Every citizen's identity will be checked.
[31:43.21]And all transgressions will be harshly prosecuted.
[31:46.98]One guy had the gun to the left.
[31:48.66]You know what I mean?
[31:50.08]Like, that guy's nodding.
[31:51.12]That guy on the right, see that?
[31:53.16]Everybody had that gun pointing down to our left.
[31:56.03]He had it pointed to our right.
[31:58.69]That's the fucking hitman right there.
[31:59.85]That's the guy that's in disguise.
[32:01.35]I don't even need to look at the back of the box to find Meryl's codec.
[32:06.71]I already know.
[32:08.95]Let him go, cousin.
[32:17.63]At least you aren't a coward.
[32:20.64]Your father would be disgusted with the monster you've become.
[32:24.48]Alright, take the guns away.
[32:26.68]And give him ski poles.
[32:27.72]Why are they in this gear here?
[32:32.34]Wouldn't it be too hot to be in... That was a jump scare for them.
[32:49.32]This is sad.
[32:49.88]Can we hit two likes?
[32:54.32]Oh, here comes the first decision.
[32:55.84]First quick-time decision in the game.
[32:59.36]He's dead.
[32:59.92]He shot either through his head.
[33:04.41]So, I'm the cause of this.
[33:10.11]Alright, forget about Pokemon.
[33:20.81]What the hell?
[33:29.44]I did that, that was great.
[33:34.80]I did that.
[33:37.67]I can't skip this cutscene, but we're too far into it.
[33:40.39]Get over here!
[33:43.79]Come here!
[34:00.02]I could have done that.
[34:01.96]Right?
[34:02.40]You, like, pinch shift me, like, 5% and let me fucking scream.
[34:05.50]I would be a great Scorpion.
[34:07.36]You know, if anyone's watching right now that's part of the Scorpion dev team, I do consulting work, you know?
[34:12.10]I think we just started a rebellion.
[34:14.51]We didn't have to drag these people into this.
[34:16.53]They are what we need to put down Project Yappa.
[34:20.43]Well, they'll need more guns.
[34:22.15]Eso.
[34:23.48]Fix the graphics.
[34:23.96]You can't.
[34:24.22]What?
[34:24.40]Put every setting to low?
[34:26.34]No.
[34:26.48]No, not yet.
[34:27.00]We can't give up yet.
[34:27.95]I promise, before the stream is over, we will do the... Best Buy computer all the way to the left on the shelf settings.
[34:34.85]I promise.
[34:58.20]I promise.
[35:05.19]Hope everything works.
[35:06.53]You've already given up.
[35:07.43]What?
[35:07.75]When have I given up yet?
[35:09.69]We just got started.
[35:10.57]Look, I can like throw this over here.
[35:12.05]He's fine.
[35:13.63]Just jump.
[35:14.35]See?
[35:17.86]See, look.
[35:18.14]There's like cars now.
[35:19.34]It already gets a letter grade.
[35:21.40]You guys understand?
[35:22.10]There's a letter grade.
[35:23.46]Holy fuck.
[35:24.52]Why are you psycho?
[35:27.40]What is it?
[35:28.62]What is it?
[35:29.70]What's wrong with their car?
[35:31.65]Wait, what?
[35:34.29]Their car was just like eating somebody.
[35:36.83]Their car was just chewing on someone.
[35:38.53]All right.
[35:39.47]Wingsuit.
[35:40.23]Oh, it's because I went over here.
[35:41.61]God damn it.
[35:42.33]Hold on.
[35:42.75]He's fine.
[35:46.30]Just jump.
[35:47.08]You can't let me... But you just opened up cars.
[35:56.99]Oh, bah, I can't do it yet.
[36:02.24]Alright, well we have to wingsuit over here.
[36:03.84]Oh, BATTLE BOSS!
[36:05.42]Ah, I thought I was supposed to press the button.
[36:12.32]Um, this is gonna take a long time.
[36:37.83]All right.
[36:39.31]At the factory.
[36:40.37]No!
[36:41.10]Sargento and Isi need some research.
[36:43.60]They can help you get this place up and running.
[36:46.40]Where are we dropping?
[36:47.46]Right here.
[36:48.08]Hola.
[36:48.24]I'm the head.
[36:49.18]Oh, there's a guy at the cube.
[36:50.86]There's a guy at the cube.
[36:51.92]That's what you've got.
[36:52.92]Dear AR lens, Mira told me.
[36:54.68]Already done.
[36:56.14]You have an AR lens?
[36:57.70]What am I?
[36:57.92]Like a little computer on your eyeball?
[36:59.54]Oh, I have to go over there.
[37:00.55]Something like that.
[37:01.49]Let's get started.
[37:10.27]I feel like this shouldn't be happening.
[37:17.83]Where am I getting the momentum to do this?
[37:21.59]Do you understand this is not physically fucking possible?
[37:30.04]That's not how these work!
[37:41.98]That's the end.
[37:48.06]I hope everything works.
[37:51.76]Perfect.
[37:54.95]Where we going?
[37:55.45]Okay, Rico.
[37:56.51]It's Luis.
[37:57.39]Uh, I mean, Sargento here.
[38:03.11]At the factory.
[38:03.89]Sargento and Izzy did some research.
[38:07.35]They can help you get this place open running.
[38:10.11]Who's Izzy?
[38:12.92]I'm the hacker.
[38:14.62]Okay.
[38:15.10]I'm gonna go this way.
[38:16.14]Can I like shit?
[38:16.86]Can I like bird shit on people?
[38:17.90]Can I like throw rocks?
[38:18.92]You know what I meant by that.
[38:20.82]Can I like throw rocks down at people?
[38:22.76]Oh!
[38:41.84]Use the AR scan to find the generators.
[38:46.03]How many times are you gonna make the Fortnite joke?
[38:48.51]Will it be every time you jump from a or will it, because that would be funny if you did that.
[38:52.81]Okay, so we just gotta find the generators.
[38:54.93]Well, there's one over here, there's one over there.
[39:11.72]This one was the closest one.
[39:13.73]What the fuck is that thing?
[39:18.69]That's somebody's little toy helicopter.
[39:22.59]What?
[39:22.93]Alright, well, this one's over here.
[39:23.91]Let's go to this one first.
[39:28.29]One.
[39:29.09]Two.
[39:31.33]I couldn't do it.
[39:31.79]I was gonna do the Byahu.
[39:36.53]So, here's the generator right here.
[39:41.96]No, I can't have this much power.
[39:50.06]I'm trying to do like tricks.
[39:52.60]All right, we're good.
[39:53.30]Use AR scanner.
[39:54.36]Shoot.
[40:10.14]I want to get on this guy's motorcycle.
[40:24.50]I need to get on this guy's motorcycle.
[40:26.70]It's important.
[40:35.28]No, don't slow down!
[40:36.57]Oh shit, I gotta turn around.
[40:41.40]No, before I lose!
[40:51.81]Okay, I gotta stop.
[40:52.69]Let's play.
[40:58.29]Okay, Sasha.
[41:00.03]Listo.
[41:00.65]Here's your mission.
[41:01.67]The factory needs to be powered on, but the doors to the electrical room are being held shut by backup generators.
[41:06.39]Mission accepted, Sargento.
[41:10.85]Oh, my body!
[41:11.15]This game just got way better, by the way.
[41:13.09]Alright, this is this one right here.
[41:14.45]Use it to scan the building.
[41:15.43]There it is.
[41:15.81]Okay, there's a generator building.
[41:16.87]Very good.
[41:17.25]Let's go over to it.
[41:18.45]Fuel barrels.
[41:40.35]Aim at the barrel and hold to start tether.
[42:01.41]That worked.
[42:01.99]Oh.
[42:04.77]I can do that?
[42:06.29]Generators well shielded.
[42:07.53]Oh my god.
[42:10.95]I think I can use my grappling hook to rip the plating off.
[42:13.51]Oh, I can use my grappling hook, but I can't use a fucking rocket launcher.
[42:21.10]And now I guess I shoot it in the guts.
[42:25.98]Built, built, built!
[42:29.48]One generator down.
[42:30.42]Alright, I get it.
[42:32.78]Okay, two more to go.
[42:34.28]You know where to look.
[42:41.82]Alright, so there's one over here.
[42:42.92]Am I gonna get minus for that one?
[42:47.35]Why?
[42:47.59]Do you think that was fun?
[42:51.75]What's closer?
[42:52.31]177 or 171?
[42:53.13]They're both right next to each other.
[42:55.56]Don't do that again!
[43:02.82]I'm fine.
[43:03.32]Is somebody shooting?
[43:21.89]Is he alive?
[43:28.51]What the fuck?
[43:29.91]What the fuck is that thing?
[43:38.55]Why is this here?
[43:45.77]Wait, what?
[43:57.22]Uh, okay.
[43:58.98]Okay, Sargento.
[44:00.42]You're up.
[44:01.75]Listo.
[44:02.39]Here's your mission.
[44:03.37]Wait, hold on.
[44:03.79]What about the little school bus?
[44:04.95]But the doors to the electrical room are being held shut by backup generators.
[44:08.41]Mission accepted, Sargento.
[44:10.57]I gotta get on the battle bus.
[44:11.49]Hold on.
[44:12.37]Your AR lens will show you where to look.
[44:15.53]Alright, I'm gonna do this quick.
[44:16.98]There's one here.
[44:17.46]Just go.
[44:17.70]I know how to do this.
[44:18.58]Let's go to this one first.
[44:19.68]That hurt, really.
[44:45.04]Okay, pull this off.
[44:48.12]What the hell are you doing?
[44:57.99]Destroy the generator, good.
[45:00.23]What's in here?
[45:02.26]What is that?
[45:04.40]What is this thing?
[45:06.96]Oh god, don't make me say like another Fortnite reference.
[45:09.38]Another Fortnite gun!
[45:12.44]What, I don't know if this... What, does this thing shoot blades?
[45:21.01]It's a toaster gun.
[45:28.41]No, this is the Halo promotion.
[45:29.85]Oh, the other one was right there.
[45:40.19]Oh!
[45:53.00]And boink.
[45:54.70]No, hold it.
[45:58.20]And let's use the Fortnite gun.
[45:59.26]It's pretty good, actually.
[46:02.42]I don't want to get rid of this.
[46:05.31]I'll get rid of this stupid thing.
[46:08.27]What do you got in this?
[46:10.71]Box.
[46:11.01]Oh, nice double Fortnite gun.
[46:22.11]Come on.
[46:22.47]Seriously, how am I alive?
[46:23.35]I don't know how I... Did the helicopter?
[46:31.96]No, it didn't.
[46:35.30]Go for the brain.
[46:39.71]Got it.
[46:40.43]Got the brain.
[46:42.11]Shoot the fucking brain, guys.
[46:43.19]Every time.
[46:53.59]Alright, we're good?
[46:57.91]I think that's it.
[46:58.71]We have one more to do, which is down here.
[47:00.93]Are we still alive in here?
[47:06.64]No, no one's alive in there.
[47:07.68]You're behind me.
[47:12.43]That was so fucking loud.
[47:13.65]Alright, let's go.
[47:16.89]Quickly.
[47:21.94]This thing is, you get to skip so much nonsense doing this.
[47:25.19]Okay, I'm gonna die if I keep doing that.
[47:27.67]I keep thinking I'm gonna... I keep hitting my fucking head on the wall.
[47:34.04]That's not good.
[47:39.58]Almost done.
[47:41.30]Here's the last one.
[47:53.00]Let's take this, and I'm gonna replace this with this.
[47:58.47]Chopper's heading this way.
[47:59.41]I'll take him out with one hit.
[48:01.09]Oh, what about this thing?
[48:03.19]Yep.
[48:15.56]Those are birds.
[48:16.18]Alright.
[48:17.98]Where they at?
[48:18.46]Come on.
[48:33.43]Alright, they're not coming.
[48:34.47]Time to go.
[48:35.51]Really?
[48:44.92]Fuck!
[48:50.24]Don't do that!
[48:50.84]No!
[48:51.46]Stop!
[49:00.35]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[49:06.65]Where is it?
[49:19.54]No!
[49:20.52]That was just... Little Mikey got a fucking toy for Christmas and that just went into the coffee table and broke.
[49:27.40]That's what that was.
[49:29.28]On the first day of Christmas day, really?
[49:31.92]Oh, whoops.
[49:41.47]Sorry, guy.
[49:41.99]All right, let's go.
[49:45.67]Pilot was laughing at the stream.
[49:53.19]Controller aim?
[49:54.33]What are you talking about?
[49:56.38]I gotta flip the switch.
[50:00.80]Open up the Ghostbusters ghost thing.
[50:07.89]Alright, come on.
[50:21.73]How do I get rid of these?
[50:24.09]Eventually I'll get it.
[50:33.80]Yeah!
[50:41.92]Here's the other one.
[50:44.63]I swear to God, I'm never gonna be able to get over it.
[50:50.65]Breakers are on.
[50:52.63]I can't, I have to do it every time.
[50:55.31]It's too much fun.
[50:56.30]Uh oh, I'm closed in.
[51:04.44]Open the map.
[51:21.03]The front line is represented by these lines on your map.
[51:24.25]This is where the Army of Chaos is holding back the Black Hand.
[51:28.63]Okay.
[51:29.77]This icon represents a deployed squad.
[51:34.54]Secure regions by advancing or deploying squads.
[51:36.86]Select the Wachikuni region.
[51:40.86]The Wachikuni.
[51:43.26]Okay.
[51:45.82]Can I, like, move the map?
[51:47.47]I think I just put one in the wrong place, apparently.
[51:50.90]I want to move the map.
[51:52.28]Okay, well.
[51:57.14]Do I just hide in here?
[51:58.73]Is this my safe bunker here?
[52:03.13]60 FPS in-game cutscene.
[52:17.06]Alright, is that mine?
[52:29.23]You got us those guns just in time.
[52:31.35]How long was I in there for?
[52:33.29]We won't be able to advance the line without more fighters.
[52:35.83]Any ideas?
[52:36.99]There was a bunch of canned soup in there.
[52:38.99]I felt like I could just stay.
[52:40.85]Create more chaos.
[52:42.23]More recruits will come.
[52:43.15]A whole army of chaos.
[52:47.33]This is what you wanted from the start?
[52:49.87]Oscar Espinosa owns this island.
[52:52.45]The people can't fight him without losing their jobs, their homes.
[52:56.15]And even if they tried, what chance would they have against a Black Hand?
[52:59.95]We have a mutual goal, Rico.
[53:01.53]This reminds me of those Kingdom Hearts 3 cutscene trailers they were showing at E3.
[53:05.73]We'll help you get to Oscar Espinosa.
[53:08.77]Okay, Mira.
[53:10.07]We'll do it your way.
[53:12.13]What's first?
[53:14.33]I got some ideas, Rico.
[53:16.53]Is that game gonna be any good?
[53:17.57]I will ready your eyeball with more information.
[53:23.98]Come on man, you opened that skin in a basic crate.
[53:27.88]Did you see my weapon skin?
[53:30.16]I bought it on the Steam store.
[53:41.88]What happened here?
[53:45.36]I thought that was music playing for a second.
[53:48.46]I thought that was a big party going on over there and that was just music.
[53:56.38]To advance your front line, you need new squads for your army.
[53:58.96]To inspire people to join you, destroy black hand infrastructure and vehicles.
[54:01.93]This creates chaos.
[54:03.97]You've notified when you have enough chaos to recruit new people into squads.
[54:19.84]I'm part of the party!
[54:23.77]Alright, we got coordinates.
[54:27.69]What is going on over here though?
[54:29.91]I need to investigate.
[54:35.11]He's playing the music over here.
[54:41.15]What weapon is this?
[54:50.06]That guy's getting lit up.
[54:51.52]Where are you going?!
[54:53.11]Oh my god!
[54:55.27]Watch it!
[54:55.73]I'm the leader, don't shoot me!
[54:56.99]Oh my lord!
[55:06.05]This person is destroying the whole bunker.
[55:15.69]What?
[55:15.95]I can fly this?
[55:16.98]Where the fuck did I go?
[55:21.70]I'm in space.
[55:23.22]I'm in space.
[55:23.86]It put me into space.
[55:27.13]Oh no, it didn't.
[55:27.81]I'm underwater.
[55:37.16]What is this thing?
[55:43.62]The blade is still spinning.
[55:45.06]It's a rare weapon down here.
[55:46.08]Look at it.
[55:49.96]Are they still shooting this thing in the fucking ground?
[55:55.78]Is there another helicopter?
[55:56.98]I don't know what's over.
[56:04.87]I'm fucking so confused.
[56:14.41]I need to get over here.
[56:19.94]Okay, so this is an enemy outpost.
[56:45.30]They just let me go on here.
[56:48.32]I'm making so much chaos though, guys.
[56:50.26]Uh-oh.
[56:53.93]Speaking of chaos... They're using the laser gun to burn me.
[57:04.67]That guy sounded like he's in my bedroom.
[57:15.35]I gotta get out of here.
[57:16.23]I gotta do like a something.
[57:17.29]I gotta do like a mission or something.
[57:22.06]There's a whole new game environment over here.
[57:27.12]Who did that?
[57:31.28]Who even did that?
[57:32.34]Alright, let's go.
[57:39.89]Where's my scanner?
[57:43.13]I did that.
[57:55.56]Hostiles still active.
[57:58.07]Hold on.
[58:02.03]Lost contact with enemy.
[58:03.01]Regroup.
[58:14.84]No, I can... Hold on.
[58:29.01]I gotta go to the mission marker.
[58:32.63]Lower the settings, this looks too real.
[58:36.29]They're just gonna do this forever, it's never gonna end, so why would I even... Oh, you can, okay, hold on.
[58:42.91]Oh, nice, I got the skin!
[58:51.85]That was a teammate.
[58:52.70]Is it a washing machine?
[59:03.54]This really is fucking Fortnite.
[59:13.55]Are you fucking serious?
[59:23.94]You idiot.
[59:27.42]Don't do it.
[59:29.62]Don't do it.
[59:30.54]I know you want to, but don't do it.
[59:34.30]I forgot even what I'm supposed to be doing.
[59:37.01]Alright, we need to go to the mission marker.
[59:38.97]Weapon crate.
[59:43.25]Turn the graphics down.
[59:44.23]No, not yet.
[59:44.87]I'm not turning the graphics off yet.
[59:46.25]Okay, release all tethers.
[59:48.97]Dude, where is the mission?
[59:56.98]Do I just have to cause chaos for like a little while?
[59:59.54]There's a chaos meter up at the top, right?
[60:08.46]How do I get to the map?
[60:18.27]Okay, there's the chaos leader.
[60:24.75]This is too much happening.
[60:30.51]Alright, I'm gonna go over here.
[60:41.46]M is not bringing up the map.
[60:44.60]It's not M. We both shot each other.
[60:50.38]I win.
[60:52.66]One?
[60:54.90]Why is the map... Why is the map one?
[60:57.69]Okay.
[60:59.67]So, we got this one here.
[61:04.73]Sargento says he's got a surprise.
[61:07.13]Go to the coordinates and see what's going on.
[61:08.77]Alright.
[61:09.83]It's S.
[61:14.94]It's right here.
[61:15.94]I made it.
[61:24.07]Stupid fucking wingsuit, man.
[61:26.10]Alright, we're good.
[61:36.76]I'm gonna get off this.
[61:40.09]This is so stupid.
[61:43.57]This would be a lot of fun, though, if this was real life.
[61:45.41]Alright, there's where I gotta go.
[61:48.89]Alright, let's wingsuit in.
[61:55.35]Nice and careful.
[61:56.23]Airbrake is control.
[61:57.11]Okay, that's how it works.
[62:02.00]What the hell is that?
[62:12.85]I'm ready.
[62:17.89]It feels like GTA with cheats.
[62:19.55]Yeah, that's exactly what it feels like.
[62:21.63]It feels like you shouldn't be able to do this.
[62:29.57]Load up the truck.
[62:30.47]We're leaving in 60 seconds.
[62:32.49]Did you organize this ambush?
[62:33.75]See?
[62:34.99]Most of the stuff he recovered is standard black ammunitions.
[62:39.78]But I also found some of these.
[62:42.96]We're not sure what they do.
[62:43.70]We didn't want to mess with them.
[62:45.28]This is very bright.
[62:48.37]Um, there's a bunch more left in the truck.
[62:50.55]Metal Gear Solid V?
[62:51.51]Fine, Sohento.
[62:52.85]This could be useful.
[62:53.63]They won't have a screwdriver.
[62:59.43]Somebody's had one and threw it right at him.
[63:00.92]Are you writing that to your grappler?
[63:02.28]No, hold us.
[63:03.10]You have to make do with whatever you find.
[63:05.08]What are you gonna do with that?
[63:05.92]So we can, uh, Metal Gear Solid V, people.
[63:07.28]That's what you're saying.
[63:10.48]You actually can.
[63:11.62]Que chimba!
[63:14.13]I mean, that's just like a straight one.
[63:16.36]They thought that was cool from Metal Gear Solid.
[63:18.44]They were like, yeah, I guess we'll go in here too.
[63:20.51]Sounds like a fun mechanic to put in our game.
[63:37.46]Alright, here we go.
[63:38.02]Grapple onto the truck.
[63:39.38]People!
[63:39.98]They're coming!
[63:40.68]Vamanos!
[63:41.62]Who's coming?
[63:42.78]I'm not even on the truck right now.
[63:44.26]This didn't work.
[63:46.92]That balloon thing is pretty cool, huh?
[63:49.78]I think it'll come in handy.
[63:51.89]Where'd you learn to plan an ambush?
[63:54.57]How do I... Oh, I want the cow.
[63:55.85]I want the cow over here.
[63:56.61]I don't care about the mission.
[63:58.19]Alright, you're fine.
[64:28.97]1.
[64:29.11]Open grappling hook menu.
[64:30.63]1, 3.
[64:33.19]Okay, airlifter.
[64:37.28]This is where you can edit your grappling hook.
[64:40.32]Currently you have loadout A equipped.
[64:42.98]You can have multiple loadouts that you can edit independently.
[64:45.02]Okay, so currently you have loadout A selected.
[64:51.28]Switch to loadout B. Edit the empty loadout.
[64:56.29]This is your loadout edit screen.
[65:00.36]Columns define what your button presses do.
[65:04.58]The auto column will activate mods automatically when the tether is deployed.
[65:10.56]Actions on the tap and hold columns will only activate when you tap or hold F. Oh, that was a huge amount of money that came in.
[65:16.88]You're right.
[65:18.91]Did we even address the last one?
[65:20.57]We did, right?
[65:27.36]Okay, I'm just making sure, like, I didn't just fucking skip it like an idiot.
[65:32.40]Uh... At a medium force airlifter to the auto column, the airlifter will automatically deploy... Medium.
[65:44.79]Okay.
[65:46.83]It's right-click to go back.
[65:48.41]This is so odd.
[65:50.34]Now the airlifter is equipped.
[65:52.34]In this loadout.
[65:54.24]Use the airlifter to clear the road.
[66:00.87]Holy shit.
[66:01.85]Wait, what am I doing?
[66:02.89]I can actually stand on this?
[66:07.89]Oops.
[66:12.83]That's bad.
[66:13.89]Okay, hold on.
[66:14.33]200 fucking dollars just came in.
[66:31.06]$100 from D34DeadC4T.
[66:31.78]Who fucking died here?
[66:36.26]Oops.
[66:36.80]Is that guy alive?
[67:01.47]Aim at the wreck.
[67:02.27]Hold on.
[67:04.11]Okay.
[67:04.55]Aim at the wreck.
[67:05.49]Hold.
[67:07.79]Who is doing this?
[67:11.75]And release.
[67:15.00]Oh my god.
[67:15.50]People are giving so much money.
[67:16.76]Hold on.
[67:17.24]Give me a second.
[67:17.78]I need to address these.
[67:21.26]DeadC4T just gave $100.
[67:22.94]$100 fucking bucks.
[67:24.94]Who even is Jermo?
[67:25.94]Also, love the YouTube.
[67:28.50]YouTube.
[67:28.70]YouTube.
[67:30.31]Thank you.
[67:31.72]That's me.
[67:33.12]I am currently Jerma.
[67:37.20]And I think I will be for a while.
[67:39.00]I don't know if I'll have any plans on being anybody else, but thank you so much, Dead C4T, for the hundred fucking dollars.
[67:49.15]And then right after that, I'm Pink gave a hundred dollars, too.
[67:52.13]A hundred, a hundred, no message, just a hundred bucks.
[67:56.17]One hundred dollars.
[67:59.65]And then right after that, $50 from Juno.
[68:05.97]And they say there's a lovely Easter egg in this game with a link.
[68:10.71]Is this a spoiler?
[68:11.61]I don't understand what it is.
[68:17.34]I don't know if that's like a spoiler.
[68:21.06]It might be a spoiler.
[68:23.08]It's a gnome.
[68:25.75]Oh my... No, it's not.
[68:27.77]Somebody just drew that on their map and pretended.
[68:31.37]But thank you to all three of you guys.
[68:34.21]That's a fucking lot of money.
[68:37.04]That's like 300 bucks in fucking an hour, not even.
[68:39.52]You guys are fucking insane.
[68:40.88]Thank you.
[68:43.18]Alright, now escort him to the extraction point.
[68:48.54]Let me get on here.
[68:51.87]Keep your eyes on the road, Sargento.
[68:53.60]What the fuck?
[68:54.60]Cause I think I could do it.
[68:56.68]Always wanted to do something important.
[68:59.66]It's complicated, Sargento.
[69:02.10]He put like a cake topper on.
[69:03.54]Alright, where is the... What do I need to do?
[69:07.49]Escort him?
[69:08.15]That's what I'm doing.
[69:14.69]See you later.
[69:15.13]Adios.
[69:19.89]Why are you not driving?
[69:23.80]Oh, maybe that's why.
[69:29.72]Extracted.
[69:31.32]Oh, that guy was in S rank.
[69:32.50]Holy shit, guys.
[69:36.78]What else?
[69:37.08]Is that it?
[69:56.41]Who is shooting at us?
[69:57.83]Where are you?
[69:59.25]What the fuck are you doing here, man?
[70:09.62]What?
[70:09.96]How are you even holding on to this?
[70:11.34]I don't have any bullets left.
[70:13.10]Oh no!
[70:13.40]Oh no!
[70:35.40]I don't know what happened.
[70:37.04]Is it because I attached it?
[70:43.10]I don't understand.
[70:44.73]That thing is so heavy.
[70:45.73]Thanks for spawning me in a great place with no fucking ammo.
[71:03.80]Okay.
[71:05.38]Start the tether.
[71:06.04]Let's go.
[71:06.38]Get it up.
[71:07.96]What have I created?
[71:09.40]Alright, we're good.
[71:14.07]Is that a grenade?
[71:21.35]Growing up in the slum, arm dead, tad long gone.
[71:25.45]Figure stuff out.
[71:29.43]This is what works for me, Sargento.
[71:31.45]You find what works for you.
[71:33.21]Get out of here.
[71:34.83]I guess.
[71:36.66]For now, just worry about getting us to the extraction point.
[71:40.88]On the head.
[71:41.66]Perfect.
[71:42.72]I need to call them.
[71:44.54]All right, I got to have a different weapon.
[71:46.04]This is the only weapon I have.
[71:58.57]I don't have any bullets in this gun, and I have no other weapon.
[72:03.38]All right, okay, here we go.
[72:04.18]Here comes again.
[72:04.62]You got this, Rico?
[72:05.76]Listo.
[72:06.16]Lukan!
[72:06.62]Lukan, this is Gemma.
[72:07.96]This time, I got the... Instruction required at Bravo Station.
[72:10.80]Don't, don't.
[72:11.96]At Bravo Station.
[72:13.47]We talked about this.
[72:19.27]Okay, there it is, there it goes.
[72:20.41]Here comes a helicopter, right?
[72:22.69]CC, we'll be waiting.
[72:29.47]What the fuck are you doing?
[72:31.55]Wait, I have to wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:33.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:36.57]What the hell?
[72:37.29]How do I let go?
[72:38.41]I have to let go of this.
[72:39.91]All right, I'm going, I'm going.
[72:57.83]These people just don't give a fuck.
[73:00.54]At all.
[73:02.68]Look at how many people are here.
[73:04.00]That guy on the motorcycle just definitely died.
[73:06.98]I can't... They just have a balloon on their car.
[73:20.63]That doesn't do... That didn't do anything.
[73:26.13]How have we not ran this guy over?
[73:28.23]What am I doing on top of the car?
[73:33.55]Get out of here.
[73:34.31]Oh, shit.
[73:36.05]Give me this.
[73:37.35]No, get on it.
[73:55.05]Oh, I don't know how to drive this.
[73:56.11]I don't know how to drive this going too fast.
[73:59.13]Alright, we're fine.
[74:01.43]Oh, fuck.
[74:02.13]No, no, I can't.
[74:03.17]I gotta get out of here.
[74:05.25]I gotta go, I gotta go.
[74:05.93]I'm almost there.
[74:06.31]Alright, don't run into him.
[74:07.09]Watch this, ready?
[74:28.37]And somehow that does not kill them.
[74:31.47]What?!
[74:35.33]Go, go, go!
[74:44.32]How do I...?
[74:47.85]Inflate, inflate!
[74:51.29]Alright, that's gonna take them away, right?
[74:53.77]How heavy is this thing?
[74:57.42]You are so heavy.
[75:08.13]Raffle them to the ground.
[75:18.64]He can't move.
[75:24.92]Oh shit.
[75:28.22]Get the blimp?
[75:30.07]It's too far away, I think.
[75:31.11]Oh no, he's alive!
[75:36.47]He's fine.
[75:37.45]Everything's fine.
[75:56.13]How do I stop this guy from doing this?
[75:57.33]I don't have any guns!
[76:02.37]I need a gun.
[76:03.17]I need to get, like, a gun or something.
[76:06.49]Gimme a gun, gimme a gun!
[76:09.97]Where's that weapon?
[76:15.12]Is it a weapon box?
[76:15.94]Weapon box!
[76:16.78]Weapon boxes everywhere, in every direction.
[76:25.61]Who was that?
[76:26.07]Okay, we're good.
[76:26.53]That's a shotgun.
[76:40.22]You're doing good, people!
[76:41.68]Don't let them through!
[76:43.42]Oh, you guys are alive.
[76:48.90]These people are fucking insane!
[76:56.26]I'm in a multiplayer GTA lobby right now.
[77:03.97]Come on, secondary fire.
[77:07.49]Don't ever blow it up.
[77:12.81]Helicopter.
[77:17.31]Where is it?
[77:23.57]Down there.
[77:24.53]What is it carrying?
[77:27.71]Time until extraction.
[77:30.43]Am I this bad?
[77:30.83]Why can I not hit this?
[77:57.20]Oh, wait.
[78:02.12]Holy fuck, thank god.
[78:09.01]Help Sargento train the army.
[78:11.93]Search the map for training and counterintelligence operations.
[78:15.77]Help Sargento and the Army of Chaos will earn mod points that can unlock airlifter mods.
[78:35.02]Alright, I don't want the stupid sniper rifle anymore.
[78:45.67]Alright, let's go.
[78:48.83]Squads received.
[78:52.89]So, this is... Garland King's new star.
[78:56.27]American filmmaker Garland King has an offer that can't be refused.
[78:58.83]Meet him, meet with her, and hear what she has to say.
[79:02.73]Yeah, let's do that.
[79:07.93]Close notifications.
[79:12.84]Oh, this is like the friends list.
[79:17.06]The 1, 2, 3 bullshit.
[79:18.74]What the hell?
[79:19.58]Make it M, man.
[79:23.84]Who's lost the target?
[79:24.78]Alright, we gotta go to G. I have a stun grenade.
[79:30.48]So we have to get from here over to there in one jump.
[79:39.27]One, two, three.
[79:55.90]Almost there.
[79:56.66]What the fuck was that?
[80:01.64]That just exploded.
[80:05.26]I'll bring them to the facility entrance.
[80:07.27]Have Evac on standby.
[80:11.22]Open the self-re-education center.
[80:14.00]I'm never gonna get that.
[80:15.04]No, I want to do the G. I had G. Whatever, let's just do this one.
[80:40.95]Open the south center.
[80:51.67]Fire stun grenade.
[80:58.88]So satisfying.
[81:00.16]Is he stunned?
[81:05.75]What the hell was that?
[81:06.59]Oh, it's a grenade launcher.
[81:14.23]I didn't kill anyone.
[81:15.37]Not one fucking person died.
[81:17.47]Not one person died!
[81:28.60]I find that hard to believe.
[81:29.74]Weapon... weapon crate?
[81:35.58]No?
[81:49.40]What the... What was that?
[81:52.89]Who are these people?
[81:53.49]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:54.85]These are... Okay, they are.
[81:55.77]I don't... Just let him go for a fly.
[82:21.45]Dropped his gun.
[82:21.97]What an idiot.
[82:23.99]What an idiot, he let go of the gun.
[83:06.42]Nice.
[83:11.71]Did you see that?
[83:12.65]Somebody saw that.
[83:13.49]You guys saw that, right?
[83:14.45]Did my computer turn off?
[83:15.57]Or did you see it?
[83:19.16]I got a rifle now.
[83:45.20]I've got a group to the entrance.
[83:46.71]Send someone to extract them.
[83:49.19]Listo.
[83:49.87]Extraction inbound.
[83:55.83]Objective locked?
[83:56.63]What?
[84:00.78]Thanks, Jerma.
[84:01.36]Very cool.
[84:03.36]You are so welcome, man.
[84:04.62]You're so gosh darn welcome.
[84:07.68]Alright, now take it back to the instruction point.
[84:11.60]That's not the right way.
[84:13.68]Back it up.
[84:14.62]Can I get in the car with you?
[84:19.91]I'm the leader of your crew.
[84:28.21]Get out of the fucking car.
[84:29.23]No, I mean, like, let me drive!
[84:33.23]Why would you turn this music on?
[84:58.92]What?
[85:01.32]Is this a radio station that's playing right now?
[85:08.87]Oh, this guy's gonna have a really bad day.
[85:11.83]They're going down.
[85:13.07]Every last one of them.
[85:16.38]Why would you turn into me?
[85:21.74]Alright, let me drop.
[85:23.14]Get out of the way.
[85:24.32]I'm not a good elf!
[85:48.82]How do I turn the fucking radio off?
[85:50.94]Thank God.
[85:51.56]I don't understand music, man.
[86:01.17]Let me complain about something here.
[86:02.53]What is with music now?
[86:04.53]Where the whole song is just, I'm building up a fucking power level.
[86:09.12]That's the whole, it's just like, here we go, here we go, it's getting a little bit bigger, it's getting stronger, here we go, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, this is it, this is the sound, here it comes, here it comes!
[86:17.89]That's every song.
[86:27.48]How many songs does it have to come out that are just...
[86:30.40]Do you want some of this?
[86:57.67]He's an out-of-touch boomer.
[86:59.01]No, it's just everybody's- everybody builds music.
[87:02.89]Instead of making a song, they build up to a song, and then the song ends.
[87:06.31]You guys about the same?
[87:18.18]Alright people, it's time to free yourselves.
[87:21.18]Come on.
[87:22.20]I can't- how am I gonna get them to- Jesus.
[87:23.89]Gracias!
[87:24.77]We owe you so much!
[87:27.51]Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[87:29.81]Let's listen to it.
[87:33.94]See?
[88:06.94]Well, you know what I mean, though.
[88:07.86]You know what I mean.
[88:10.54]Did the car just blow?
[88:36.99]No, no, no, no.
[88:38.03]I'm trying to get the helicopter over here.
[88:39.61]Did it work?
[88:49.62]It worked.
[88:51.58]Making sure he's dead.
[88:57.03]Alright, let's go.
[88:57.49]Where are my friends?
[89:11.13]There's a person right here.
[89:12.13]All right, let's do it.
[89:20.12]Okay, give us a little hype in the chat.
[89:43.58]Oh, I'll take this.
[89:48.85]Alright.
[90:01.83]We did it.
[90:02.21]No, we didn't.
[90:04.33]Cover their escape.
[90:05.01]Ooh, look at that.
[90:06.37]Hold on.
[90:08.42]I gotta turn on the fucking music.
[90:11.66]This doesn't have a radio?
[90:13.17]I- okay.
[90:13.89]That's fun.
[90:14.95]That's fun.
[90:15.31]That was a fucking band of Legos, apparently.
[90:18.63]No visual on target.
[90:20.49]Command advice.
[90:24.37]Target is at large.
[90:25.52]Re-establish visual.
[90:27.70]We can't go any further.
[90:28.68]Carajo, how do we get through?
[90:30.22]Push it over.
[90:31.94]Easy, sargento.
[90:32.94]Ideas.
[90:34.64]What do we do?
[90:35.00]Use your gravity to pull the bridge down.
[90:36.34]Blow up the mechanism, keeping it up.
[90:54.00]I was hoping it could- I was seeing if it could fall this way.
[90:56.50]It could crush everyone.
[90:59.84]Yellow belt!
[91:12.15]Now we gotta go like this.
[91:18.85]Come on, use a grapple up and pull the bridge down.
[91:44.37]Nice!
[91:46.25]Imagine how sick this would make you.
[92:17.07]You didn't expect me, did ya?
[92:22.97]Alright, we're almost out.
[92:25.12]Quick!
[92:27.60]Well, you didn't do that.
[92:28.36]Alright, we gotta go in the tractor.
[92:30.48]Can I fit everybody in the tractor here?
[92:35.78]Ah, this has just got a full letter grade, by the way.
[92:41.82]Look at all these fuel tanks!
[92:43.44]Carajo!
[92:47.81]Alright, how do I... How do I pick somebody up?
[92:51.04]Old Z. Oh.
[92:52.84]That's how.
[93:00.83]Wait, wait, hold on.
[93:17.40]No!
[93:19.10]Battle bots.
[93:21.34]God damn it.
[93:27.02]Oh, thank God it's starting to be over here.
[93:30.94]Oh, here we go.
[93:31.54]Here we go.
[93:32.04]Here we go.
[93:32.54]Here we go.
[93:33.08]Here we go.
[93:33.60]Here we go.
[93:34.20]Thank God I can do it again.
[93:55.25]I can't pick him up.
[94:19.02]It's just toys.
[94:20.56]It really is.
[94:21.24]They just... It's just bouncy toys.
[94:24.85]Just Cause 2 was the same way, man.
[94:26.67]It was just fucking toys.
[94:29.25]Where is everybody?
[94:32.33]Toy chest 2.
[94:33.09]What are you shooting at?
[94:36.75]I don't even know.
[94:37.45]Fine.
[94:37.95]Take them down.
[94:38.45]Blow them up.
[94:39.22]Whatever.
[94:39.56]Who cares?
[94:44.74]Nothing even matters.
[94:47.55]All right, I'm gonna put my face in this one.
[94:59.00]You kidding me?
[95:03.38]What?
[95:03.56]What?
[95:03.76]Back off!
[95:14.61]Get out of here.
[95:15.41]Weapon chest.
[95:17.85]Oh, long scope.
[95:19.07]All right.
[95:24.19]Destroy the infrastructure.
[95:26.88]There's one more.
[95:28.76]Where is it?
[95:30.06]Up there.
[95:30.52]Oh, this is going to be an epic moment.
[95:42.30]No!
[96:12.18]I didn't get it.
[96:12.64]Okay, we're good.
[96:16.06]Let's get out of here.
[96:17.56]Not even fucking close.
[96:19.76]Alright.
[96:22.03]Cover the escape.
[96:26.89]Alright.
[96:31.97]You good?
[96:33.09]I got all three of us, right?
[96:34.03]That guy got hit in the face with an explosion.
[96:37.74]I think we lost one.
[96:40.22]Mierda!
[96:40.78]Another freeze!
[96:42.43]Lower the bridge.
[96:43.41]Who is dropping grenades on us?
[96:45.17]Where are these coming from?
[96:47.51]Who the fuck is throwing these?
[96:50.31]They're just appearing out of the sky.
[96:54.81]Who?
[96:57.73]Where is he?
[96:58.85]Where is he?
[96:59.91]Is he on the boat?
[97:05.73]He was facing the fucking other direction.
[97:21.51]Alright, here we go.
[97:25.40]Okay, one of these guys... I gotta make... I'm gonna turn on the fucking jets here, guys.
[97:31.26]Sorry.
[97:47.96]Had to turn it off for a minute.
[97:55.09]He's got my ammo, but I would have jaxed him.
[97:57.38]Oh no, you're gonna die.
[97:58.44]I need something.
[97:59.04]How much health do you have?
[98:03.58]Stay okay.
[98:04.94]No, no, no!
[98:05.18]Get out of the way!
[98:05.68]Get out of the way!
[98:06.12]No, no, no!
[98:06.40]Get out of the way!
[98:06.96]Out of the way!
[98:08.50]You idiot.
[98:19.91]Wait, you're almost out?
[98:26.14]Who's left?
[98:29.96]I gotta make sure at least one guy gets out.
[98:36.08]Why are you walking up there?
[98:49.00]What are you doing?
[98:57.05]At least get in the car, dude.
[98:59.97]Get in the car.
[99:00.67]Can you get in the car?
[99:04.74]Get in.
[99:14.94]That's the last group, Sargento.
[99:24.21]He made it.
[99:27.05]He did it!
[99:28.27]We got one person!
[99:31.30]Alright, so now we can open the map and... What was the mission we were doing?
[99:39.96]What the hell were we doing something?
[99:41.82]By clearing 1A extraction, you made it safe for the army to advance and secure the Tierra del Cuapag region.
[99:49.47]And by causing chaos, you earned more squads, which are now awaiting your orders in the reserves.
[99:56.67]Ready to secure.
[99:58.03]This number indicates how many squads you need from your reserves to secure the area.
[100:02.46]One.
[100:03.78]Two.
[100:04.22]Lower this cost by securing adjacent regions and advancing already deployed squads instead of deploying new ones from your reserves.
[100:11.54]Okay.
[100:12.12]Let's get it.
[100:14.44]I win.
[100:14.78]This is what I was trying to do in the first place.
[100:17.65]But what is this?
[100:19.71]The Army of Chaos is getting ready to retrieve intel from a black hand radar outpost, but before they move, Mira needs a favor.
[100:25.21]Alright, hold on a second here.
[100:30.76]Unlock moths.
[100:34.40]Gas.
[100:35.46]Choose different gases for explosive effects.
[100:37.70]Helium, explosive, hydrogen.
[100:40.60]So I can make a balloon and explode it.
[100:43.60]Fragile.
[100:45.21]Change the armor used on the airlifter.
[100:46.61]Fragile.
[100:47.01]Involve a player.
[100:47.69]Involve enemies.
[100:48.45]Okay.
[100:48.73]Okay.
[100:51.40]Float.
[100:51.92]Change how the airlifter moves.
[100:53.42]Float, guided, follow.
[101:01.71]Peak altitude.
[101:02.69]Change the maximum altitude of the airlifter.
[101:05.25]Holy shit.
[101:08.73]I don't even need to see the other ones.
[101:14.31]Set what the lifter will do at its peak altitude.
[101:16.79]You can hover it or pop.
[101:20.11]Okay.
[101:20.75]Well, let's try this.
[101:22.59]Gas, gas.
[101:23.19]Step on the gas.
[101:25.73]We got something new over here.
[101:26.97]Splash damage.
[101:28.15]Oh, man.
[101:29.27]Oh, I only got one kill?
[101:32.74]Alright, let's go.
[101:42.72]Um... Um... What happened?
[101:50.98]Did I?
[101:51.26]What did I do?
[101:51.89]Um, okay.
[102:09.96]Got him.
[102:12.94]You actually made it over there?
[102:14.00]How the fuck did you do that, man?
[102:16.72]I don't believe it.
[102:27.66]How many of these balloons is it going to take to... It's pulling in every direction.
[102:41.61]You're still fine up there.
[102:43.75]How is that even possible?
[102:48.66]Still just floating around.
[102:51.32]Get over there!
[102:55.92]Still hasn't crashed.
[103:00.44]Alright, it's my turn.
[103:01.75]I wanna see how hard this is.
[103:03.39]It's not even fucking hard.
[103:07.85]You're overreacting.
[103:11.13]Alright, where am I going?
[103:20.54]Alright, get rid of the tethers.
[103:21.52]I just have a helicopter, alright, so I can fire missile or switch vehicle position.
[103:28.78]Alright, well I have 91 missiles.
[103:31.92]That should probably cause chaos, right?
[103:33.74]Why did that hurt me?
[103:48.75]You understand?
[103:50.15]I shot that thing and it blew me up.
[103:51.45]What's this, fucking thorns damage?
[103:53.56]Another one of those spying bastardos down.
[103:59.88]Gracias, Rico.
[104:00.96]Oh, I was supposed to do that.
[104:01.84]Alright, cool.
[104:06.89]Somebody's gone out on a SAM site, aren't they?
[104:11.63]Where?
[104:19.04]Well, I just was playing around
[104:49.55]Alright.
[104:50.15]Where am I going?
[104:52.53]Here.
[104:52.79]Right here.
[104:53.17]Track it.
[104:56.31]Right here.
[105:18.53]Here it comes!
[105:19.17]Here it comes!
[105:21.01]Here it comes!
[105:29.72]If you're sitting down, get up, dance, now!
[105:32.49]Unless you're driving, in that case, just move your head.
[106:03.97]I'm a monster?
[106:04.61]I'm not.
[106:32.22]I don't even know how I hit my head on the ground.
[106:33.92]That didn't make any sense.
[106:37.60]Action.
[106:38.62]Action.
[106:39.20]Okay.
[106:40.07]Start it.
[106:43.51]Just, it seems to happen every single time.
[106:44.89]You're right.
[106:45.77]Just get it done.
[106:47.27]Hey, go sober up Charlie.
[106:48.65]Get him working on some new pages with the frogs.
[106:52.29]Hey, look at you, you handsome devil.
[106:55.41]Garland King, you've heard of me.
[106:57.56]No, but I've heard you can help the Army of Chaos.
[106:59.96]Let's not worry about that now.
[107:01.10]Come on, walk with me.
[107:03.44]Rico.
[107:04.73]I love everything about you, man.
[107:06.57]The look, the swagger, the leather.
[107:10.46]The watch.
[107:11.14]I get to be in the movie?
[107:14.24]This seems like it's going to be kind of fun.
[107:33.91]And I want you to... Just blow it up.
[107:39.61]Turn off motion blur?
[107:44.99]I don't think you can.
[107:47.67]Are you in?
[107:49.47]Perfect!
[107:50.81]We'll get your agent a copy of the contract.
[107:53.19]You don't have an agent.
[107:54.23]We'll get you an agent.
[107:55.85]We're gonna do amazing things together, doll.
[107:58.39]Okay.
[108:00.13]Whoa.
[108:00.95]Alright, I'm ready.
[108:03.94]I'll try to turn it off in this setting.
[108:08.22]Let's go to settings.
[108:09.02]I thought I didn't see it there.
[108:11.24]Army of Chaos pilots will pick... That was not long enough.
[108:13.94]Alright, so hold on.
[108:14.56]Let me see.
[108:14.82]Hold on a second here.
[108:23.83]Edge Fade.
[108:29.59]Is that doing it?
[108:41.62]That looks awful.
[108:42.29]That looks three times worse.
[108:58.74]Put it on low?
[109:03.82]What if I do this?
[109:11.80]Oh god, why is it always, all of it looks bad?
[109:16.18]Hold on.
[109:23.08]Global, maybe it's a global illumination.
[109:28.17]I don't think it's that.
[109:29.69]Because everything looks just so ugly.
[109:31.11]Oh, whatever.
[109:31.95]Alright, grappling hook menu.
[109:34.68]Uh-huh.
[109:39.76]You now have a new loadout.
[109:41.44]Select loadout number C. Edit the loadout.
[109:44.95]Add boosters to the tap column so that it activates when tapping F. Equip a booster with high boost force.
[109:52.55]Tap here.
[109:52.99]Okay.
[109:56.02]Okay, we're looking for high force.
[110:02.71]Now the blister is equipped.
[110:05.65]He's not reading our suggestions?
[110:07.34]What are you talking about?
[110:11.50]Shadow and motion blur is the biggest FPS hog.
[110:16.32]No, we're not doing potato mode yet.
[110:18.26]Tell the boosters to... Okay.
[110:20.54]So... And then release.
[110:24.77]Aim at the marked area on the rust bucket and hold... But, I mean, are these boosters, though?
[110:28.15]Do I have to tap, like, F?
[110:37.20]Oh, okay, there it is.
[110:38.44]So, that's it.
[110:53.58]Time for Gary's mod Oh
[111:26.63]Not even.
[111:27.91]Stunt on... what?
[111:31.65]Stunt on the van?
[111:40.27]Cover Garland's escape.
[111:41.97]Wait, what do you mean they're escaped?
[112:01.29]What's wrong with you?
[112:05.68]Oh, shi- Oh, you're so high.
[112:13.54]I'm gonna catch you, I can catch you.
[112:15.04]I'll get you, I'll get you, I'll get you.
[112:17.50]I'm gonna catch her.
[112:18.66]I'll catch her with my hands.
[112:30.90]I have to get her back over here.
[112:41.94]Well, now we're getting fired at.
[112:52.49]Where did these people come from?
[112:54.03]Alright, let's go.
[113:00.80]Looks like you're my star and my bodyguard.
[113:03.12]I haven't agreed to anything.
[113:05.68]Always.
[113:06.30]I got a lot of expensive equipment in this van, so don't let him wreck us.
[113:10.83]Don't.
[113:11.15]I won't let him wreck us.
[113:11.95]Don't worry.
[113:12.31]Fine.
[113:13.99]I came here to shoot my next picture.
[113:15.95]My magnum opus.
[113:19.15]Oh.
[113:19.95]Yeah.
[113:21.61]It looks like a paradise, but everywhere you go is permits.
[113:25.01]They only give you permits if you're espoused.
[113:29.18]What does that even mean?
[113:31.20]Alright, we're fine.
[113:52.85]Not you and me, Rico.
[113:54.25]We're a pair.
[113:55.61]Stick with me, kid.
[113:56.89]Starring in my picture will make you huge.
[113:58.71]And I get run over by the car.
[114:01.84]Solis will love you.
[114:04.48]The world will love you.
[114:07.20]No further contact.
[114:08.32]All units stay alert.
[114:09.08]Damn it.
[114:09.86]Damn it!
[114:10.14]You lost contact with enemy.
[114:11.62]Where are we going?
[114:12.40]I'm gonna go.
[114:14.26]This game hurts my brain.
[114:14.88]You're gonna fake my death.
[114:15.92]I'm so sorry.
[114:17.37]We just met and I'm already faking your death.
[114:20.94]Oh, no.
[114:21.34]Let go of that.
[114:22.16]Holy shit.
[114:22.64]Alright, I gotta...
[114:44.93]Lure him away, then wreck the van!
[114:47.11]Make it look like I died in a big explosion!
[114:49.65]That's how I always wanted to go.
[114:52.31]Are you kidding?
[114:53.45]I wouldn't care about my own death.
[114:56.73]Make it dramatic.
[114:58.01]Bombastic!
[114:59.37]Should buy me a few hours.
[115:01.07]Is this far enough away?
[115:02.65]Is this far enough away?
[115:10.72]Actual, actually Gary's mod.
[115:16.48]Ugh.
[115:17.24]Actually fucking Gary's mod.
[115:27.87]Alright, let's go.
[115:28.65]Lower him away.
[115:31.76]Okay.
[115:31.98]I can't top what I just did, lady.
[115:41.32]Alright, here we are.
[115:42.80]Make it look bad.
[115:43.80]Alright, lure them away.
[115:45.23]Watch it, watch it!
[115:45.97]So I have to... I'm just going off into the water.
[115:48.33]Mine was so much cooler.
[116:15.76]Somehow, even with nitrous attached, you are faster than him.
[116:20.76]Okay, wreck the van.
[116:29.93]That wasn't enough.
[116:31.35]To wreck the van.
[116:36.31]The van is still fine.
[116:37.53]Not good enough.
[116:48.06]I didn't get the fuck out of my way.
[116:49.94]I'm trying to destroy myself.
[116:51.84]Oh, I was supposed to get out of the van!
[117:02.27]Get out of the van!
[117:11.85]I did it!
[117:12.63]I did it!
[117:14.99]No!
[117:15.41]Get back there, quick!
[117:37.04]It's me, Dutch van der Linde!
[117:40.84]Move.
[117:41.10]Move!
[117:41.30]Move, move, move, move, move.
[117:55.93]That guy was aiming his wrist completely backwards.
[117:58.67]Alright, I gotta tap it.
[118:02.67]I'm ready to go over the jump.
[118:05.98]And then I'm going to get out.
[118:06.90]I'm not going to be inside.
[118:08.44]Why don't I just skip that?
[118:09.66]I'm going to skip the whole fucking thing.
[118:15.72]See?
[118:15.91]I just skipped all that bullshit.
[118:17.59]Driving around the mountain.
[118:26.61]Add thrusters to it.
[118:38.99]I can't get in the van.
[118:53.32]It's gonna land.
[118:54.18]I'm gonna die.
[118:54.82]We're good.
[119:04.90]All right.
[119:05.14]It worked.
[119:05.82]Sheesh.
[119:06.12]I want to get on the boat.
[119:07.26]Help Garland shoot her Opus.
[119:08.38]Search the map for stunts and scene shots.
[119:09.74]Pretty cool feature.
[119:35.33]That's what I was looking for.
[119:36.37]This bike is fast.
[119:39.69]Holy shit.
[119:44.01]What are you doing?
[119:45.65]Why are you like this?
[119:47.83]Why are you like this?
[119:49.65]I don't even care!
[119:54.23]Dammit.
[119:54.69]Oh, man.
[120:10.26]Tornado, what do you mean tornado, tornado, tornado, tornado?
[120:12.92]Oh, there's a tornado over there.
[120:22.61]There's a, cool, let's take a look.
[120:45.87]Thanks for the boost.
[120:47.01]I appreciate it.
[120:48.95]Alright, let's go to the tornado.
[120:54.90]I lost control of the bike.
[120:56.44]Oh fuck, that is a suicide drive.
[121:00.12]That guy still has a fucking... I can't even pay attention.
[121:06.35]Did you see that bird explosion?
[121:09.43]My tire is fucked up.
[121:10.53]Hold on, I gotta straighten out.
[121:21.71]I wish you would just get out of the fucking way.
[121:30.07]Fine, you wanna go to the tornado too?
[121:31.50]That's fine with me.
[121:32.80]New bike.
[121:35.86]This is a fast one.
[121:49.67]How far away is the tornado?
[121:51.74]Looks pretty far away.
[121:55.10]Holy shit, okay, it worked.
[121:57.64]It actually worked.
[122:05.21]How do I lose the police?
[122:08.59]Ooh.
[122:15.43]This is not the way that I want to be going.
[122:17.51]This way.
[122:22.57]No, no, no, put that away!
[122:25.73]Alright, we're fine.
[122:31.37]Actually, it's safer to be this way, and somehow you were right next to me, don't ask me how.
[122:51.58]Alright, here's a tornado.
[122:59.12]If this guy's still right behind me, I was gonna say, no way.
[123:07.01]Okay, I can take a second here to make sure I get the right spot.
[123:09.23]No, he is right behind me.
[123:16.62]What am I even stuck on here?
[123:22.65]I'm taking them on... here there's a helicopter.
[123:32.87]It's still chasing me.
[123:34.81]I am just surprised you can even get over here.
[123:36.95]Okay.
[123:43.51]We're almost at the tornado.
[123:44.95]It's right here.
[123:51.79]There it is.
[123:52.19]Oh, easy though.
[123:57.53]I'm safe, right?
[124:09.01]It's so far away.
[124:09.99]He actually made it, huh?
[124:15.58]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:27.91]We're so close.
[124:28.79]What can you even do here?
[124:30.27]Can I be like a storm chaser?
[124:40.50]Alright, here it is.
[124:47.88]Holy shit.
[124:48.94]Do these people know there's a tornado on the road?
[124:54.84]Nobody seems to really give a shit.
[125:02.06]Do I live if I go in here?
[125:03.16]Oh my goodness, this is huge.
[125:06.67]Okay, I'm in it.
[125:07.91]I made it.
[125:41.46]Let's wingsuit in there.
[125:48.60]What the fuck was that?
[125:50.17]Was that a blimp?
[125:55.13]Oh, the helicopters.
[125:56.69]Why would you even fly over here?
[125:58.37]What the hell are you thinking?
[126:05.57]Look at all these cars.
[126:07.99]Here we go.
[126:12.23]Oh no, no, no, don't die again.
[126:13.75]Alright, I'm gonna be flying for this.
[126:25.06]Alright, wingsuit activated.
[126:32.63]Oh, all your organs flying out of your body right now.
[126:38.76]Nooo!
[126:39.54]Stay!
[126:41.02]Shit!
[126:42.13]Activate the wingsuit again, quick!
[126:46.73]Wow, I just scraped the ground.
[126:48.13]Holy shit, I'm going all the way up.
[126:59.38]How high can I go?
[127:08.89]Is that it?
[127:09.96]How high am I?
[127:13.44]I'm not even sure where I am.
[127:18.68]Holy fuck, that's crazy.
[127:25.02]I'm going up even higher.
[127:27.47]Alright, this is where we Spider- Empire State Building.
[127:55.81]That's fun.
[127:56.57]Look at this.
[127:57.15]Alright, let me do one more thing.
[128:05.87]I just want to be all the way at the top.
[128:07.19]I want to lose control.
[128:08.55]I don't want to have a waiting suit on.
[128:09.47]I just want to get off this and be flailing around.
[128:16.27]Like that.
[128:19.94]I guess it doesn't matter.
[128:22.94]Hold on.
[128:23.14]Can I not get back in like this?
[128:35.53]I guess not.
[128:36.05]I'm trying to just stay in the ragdoll.
[128:40.51]But it looks like he just floated.
[129:02.42]Where do we end up?
[129:03.19]I'm not sure.
[129:06.41]This is chaos, though, apparently.
[129:08.68]I'm causing chaos.
[129:19.36]Did I get out of the eye of the storm?
[129:20.92]No, I'm going around again.
[129:21.92]There's a helicopter in here now.
[129:29.52]Where's the helicopter?
[129:39.52]Where did the helicopter go?
[129:40.28]I have to get a plane into the tornado.
[129:46.72]Oh, there's the helicopter.
[129:59.84]Plane.
[130:00.86]Plane.
[130:04.20]We have a problem.
[130:07.98]Ah, we have a big problem.
[130:10.42]I can't do anything.
[130:13.96]Control.
[130:14.54]E. Space.
[130:16.49]Alt.
[130:17.43]Click.
[130:18.31]Q. I can't do anything.
[130:27.67]Can I pull a gun out or something?
[130:29.53]Stay in Ragdoll.
[130:30.41]Hold Control.
[130:31.09]Hold Control.
[130:41.06]I can't do anything.
[130:42.82]Can I, like, eat a grenade or something?
[130:52.05]No, I didn't meet that guy yet.
[131:03.90]Alright, I need to get out of this.
[131:09.45]How do I get... I don't want to, like, exit the game.
[131:14.11]Oh, I will.
[131:16.79]Just give me a few minutes.
[131:22.44]I need to grab onto something.
[131:25.04]Is this just a table flying around?
[131:31.88]Just wait for it to blow over, will this disappear?
[131:33.58]Oh wait, here comes the blimp.
[131:36.42]The blimp is gonna get sucked in.
[131:38.39]And then I'm gonna grapple onto the blimp.
[131:40.43]Seems like the only thing I'm able to do.
[131:48.27]Come on, pull it in close enough.
[131:50.75]Or even another helicopter, I gotta... No, flying around too erratically.
[131:59.32]Table?
[131:59.66]Can I grab the table?
[132:01.45]Okay, I'm going to try to grapple the table.
[132:03.99]I can get it.
[132:07.57]It's going to be close.
[132:08.35]I just had the indicator.
[132:14.89]Okay, hold on.
[132:19.69]Fuck.
[132:21.95]I can't grab it.
[132:23.17]I need to grab that.
[132:26.21]Fucking god damn it.
[132:35.94]I need another table.
[132:37.24]I need to grapple a table.
[132:39.82]Or a tree?
[132:41.42]I had the indicator on the fucking table.
[132:48.25]Don't worry, in like another couple minutes a table will come up.
[132:56.57]Come on, up higher.
[133:01.06]I can use the grapple hook though, that's really important.
[133:05.09]I just need something that I can grab to fly up here.
[133:07.28]Like that.
[133:09.02]That hunk of metal right there.
[133:10.48]Come on.
[133:13.60]Go up.
[133:18.30]Shit.
[133:18.56]No, can't grab the tree.
[133:30.94]This should be the loading screen of the game.
[133:33.84]I'm so mad that I couldn't grab that table when I had a chance.
[133:36.08]The tornado is moving, so maybe we'll get another opportunity.
[133:43.36]The tornado is moving.
[133:44.72]Am I going towards the direction of this?
[133:47.10]Pass through the ring faster than 70 miles per hour.
[133:49.62]I think I'm going that fast.
[133:55.40]I hear a noise.
[133:59.96]Can I grab that?
[134:00.82]I'm not low enough.
[134:15.68]That sounds like a table.
[134:21.98]Can I booster myself?
[134:23.50]No, I can't.
[134:25.54]I wish I could.
[134:29.65]Debris?
[134:30.09]Here comes debris.
[134:30.71]Might have a chance here in a second.
[134:35.98]Debris on the way up.
[134:37.88]Think I see a table?
[134:38.62]Any tables in there?
[134:43.32]Order a boat?
[134:47.44]Can I order something?
[134:56.28]I'm getting lower to the ground.
[134:59.91]Get it!
[135:00.69]I can't grapple it!
[135:02.57]No!
[135:03.19]I'm too high!
[135:07.05]Almost, I was so close.
[135:10.54]Press E?
[135:12.18]I can't do anything, man.
[135:18.88]Can't you strafe?
[135:20.00]Uh, I can't do anything, all I can do is spin around in a circle.
[135:28.61]I need... Yeah, there is one way to escape this.
[135:30.33]That's a table.
[135:31.93]Coming up through the vent here.
[135:35.61]Did I... I missed a table?
[135:37.53]Did I really?
[135:38.09]No, I didn't.
[135:52.12]What a great stream.
[135:53.34]Huh?
[136:03.18]Alright, I'm just gonna fast travel.
[136:04.94]Wait, did I just get out?
[136:07.38]No.
[136:09.48]Table right there?
[136:10.12]Alright, I'm gonna go here.
[136:18.05]How do I fast travel?
[136:25.17]I don't think I even can.
[136:30.34]Where the fuck am I?
[136:31.76]What's happening?
[136:37.86]No, I have to get out on my own.
[136:39.38]I can't use voice commands.
[136:40.92]What do you mean you can't use voice commands?
[136:42.36]I just read somebody's chatroom message.
[136:48.68]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[136:51.20]I just saw something right here.
[136:56.73]Somebody wrote that.
[137:02.91]We're going up in water right now.
[137:04.25]There's nothing here.
[137:06.31]I missed my opportunity like twice.
[137:09.42]Can't do it to trees.
[137:19.64]Go into the tornado?
[137:21.04]I can't really control where I'm going.
[137:29.44]I can't control... I have to stop this.
[137:32.64]I have to stop this right now.
[137:36.31]Somebody just wrote, I'm getting sick to my stomach.
[137:38.44]And that's where I have to... I gotta, like, make sure I don't make somebody throw up.
[137:48.13]I'm making people sick.
[137:51.42]Wait, ooh!
[138:01.95]I have to get out of here.
[138:03.72]I have to get out of here, guys.
[138:05.58]There's no more... This is not fun anymore.
[138:08.66]This is just bad.
[138:09.56]This is not fun.
[138:11.58]There's no tables to grab onto.
[138:14.53]Alright, is there... We're going over a couple of houses.
[138:18.75]There's an opportunity right here when we go over this house.
[138:29.75]Hold on.
[138:30.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[138:31.71]Right there.
[138:32.32]Come on.
[138:33.94]Turn this way.
[138:34.44]Come on.
[138:37.00]See it?
[138:37.42]You see it, right?
[138:37.92]You see it.
[138:39.34]You see it.
[138:39.94]You see it.
[138:40.58]You see it.
[138:42.76]Come on.
[138:43.48]You see it.
[138:44.22]I do.
[138:47.35]Come on.
[138:48.07]There comes another blimp.
[138:58.43]Get to the top.
[139:02.20]Get me in some... It didn't get it!
[139:07.74]What?
[139:08.16]How did it not get that?
[139:09.86]I... I'm out!
[139:11.81]I got out!
[139:22.13]Alright, we're good.
[139:30.06]I feel better.
[139:35.30]Time to respawn in the tornado.
[139:40.24]Now I need to get a plane and fly into it.
[139:43.10]That's a really good idea.
[139:44.16]So let me track down a plane.
[139:51.88]Are you telling me that guy gets away?
[139:54.14]That guy gets away?
[139:55.08]The guy on the motorcycle gets the fuck away?
[139:58.39]But not the guy on the 3,000 pound car?
[140:07.07]I need a plane.
[140:08.45]How do I get a plane?
[140:12.23]Is there like an airfield or something around here?
[140:16.99]Wingsuit stunt, car stunt, speed stunt.
[140:23.57]You can order it.
[140:29.21]Get one from your airdrop.
[140:30.91]That doesn't exist.
[140:35.93]There's a plane in the airport.
[140:37.07]Where's an airport?
[140:41.82]Airport.
[140:54.36]That was a plane just crashing.
[140:57.86]I feel like if I wait long enough, a plane will just... Excuse me?
[141:06.20]I just have to go somewhere and just look in the sky.
[141:08.13]Alright, what about over here?
[141:17.09]I just heard a plane.
[141:19.06]What if I get up here?
[141:20.40]Right there.
[141:29.53]Come here.
[141:38.42]Pin.
[141:39.24]Point.
[141:39.64]Fucking accuracy.
[141:40.84]And was it worth it?
[141:42.12]Was it worth it in the end?
[141:54.29]Give me a fucking plane.
[141:58.83]He actually got out of that.
[141:59.99]What a bunch of dog shit.
[142:14.55]Get me up here.
[142:17.37]Will you get up there, dude?
[142:18.85]What are you doing?
[142:19.83]You're driving me nuts.
[142:23.20]That's really fucking funny.
[142:31.42]I'm ready for a plane.
[142:53.11]Apparently not ready for the plane to drive by me.
[143:08.44]I'm so upset right now.
[143:13.82]Another one's gonna just drive by, right?
[143:15.34]This is like the plane drive-by zone.
[143:20.59]The tornado's gone.
[143:21.97]There's no more tornado.
[143:23.78]There's no point to do this right now.
[143:33.21]Okay.
[143:38.73]Come here, you motherfucker.
[144:01.76]What the fuck?
[144:02.62]Here's my chance.
[144:12.56]Get over here.
[144:13.02]Fly over here.
[144:24.20]Do I have... I'm gonna have to... I got a drastic...
[144:32.45]I'm right here, man.
[144:33.95]I'm right here.
[144:54.54]I did it too, man.
[144:55.70]I right clicked.
[145:09.08]Target is gone.
[145:41.18]I was gonna drive right into the fucking rock.
[145:55.39]What?
[145:56.63]Did they crash into each other?
[146:00.87]Why are you driving that close to the water?
[146:02.43]What's wrong with you?
[146:08.90]You're skimming the water right now.
[146:10.38]There's no reason to be doing what you're doing.
[146:11.80]It's gonna go in the water.
[146:19.35]It's gonna fall in the water.
[146:46.11]Alright, let's go.
[146:51.29]Airport.
[146:52.73]No, it's too far.
[146:55.77]Just drop.
[147:03.18]Just respawn.
[147:04.38]Move on.
[147:08.24]Okay.
[147:10.02]Let's take a look at the mini-map for a second and see what we got.
[147:15.15]I need, okay, so we got some stunt missions.
[147:20.38]Kantos.
[147:21.88]That looks like an airport.
[147:26.04]Found one, okay.
[147:27.52]I just gotta go this way, to Kantos.
[147:30.28]I need to make a waypoint.
[147:32.48]That's a really strange waypoint marker that I have to make.
[147:36.20]What even button is that?
[147:39.40]Toggle waypoint.
[147:40.48]Tap, what is that?
[147:41.88]It's space, okay.
[147:42.90]I was like, what is that on the keyboard?
[147:47.23]I thought it was an underscore.
[147:48.31]Okay.
[148:05.03]Wait, that guy's a bike.
[148:06.39]No, forget the bike.
[148:25.16]Okay, here we go.
[148:26.96]They suck!
[148:44.94]Here we go.
[148:51.06]I can't do it.
[148:53.18]I'm trying to go too fast.
[148:54.56]There we go.
[149:08.83]Straight ahead.
[149:11.81]Every time when he says, here we go, is when he hits the ground.
[149:15.33]I was looking in chat.
[149:16.09]That didn't count.
[149:44.95]That didn't do anything.
[149:48.99]AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[150:15.30]Alright, almost there.
[150:21.89]That sounded like an elephant.
[150:36.76]Do something cool?
[150:39.80]I can't.
[150:40.36]I can't do anything.
[150:41.18]I fucking swear to god.
[150:51.90]What the fuck?
[150:54.04]Alright, so where's the airport?
[151:00.53]Over here.
[151:15.64]Almost there.
[151:17.20]Airport.
[151:21.77]I fucking hate myself.
[151:29.05]So where the fuck is the airport?
[151:31.27]It's like right over the bridge here?
[151:52.17]So, like, over here.
[151:52.85]Behind the hill.
[151:56.27]Alright.
[151:58.09]Let's get a plane.
[152:04.98]Is this... Do these things work?
[152:07.18]Could you actually do this?
[152:08.06]Alright.
[152:11.18]Plane.
[152:12.12]There's a plane right there.
[152:18.63]Can I get a... Can I get that?
[152:20.19]Is that a plane I can get?
[152:28.73]What happened to you?
[152:35.67]It really is just- Oh look, a little guy!
[152:37.87]Let's take it.
[152:44.90]How do you fly planes?
[152:46.56]I have no idea.
[152:48.98]Hold C or Z to turn.
[152:51.20]C or Z?
[153:00.29]How do you fly?
[153:03.67]I'm holding E. Control.
[153:07.67]Okay, it's control.
[153:09.56]Off we go.
[153:10.26]Why am I going backwards?
[153:13.66]That doesn't make any logical sense.
[153:15.18]Why am I going backwards?
[153:34.12]Okay, control is reverse, if you were curious.
[153:40.94]Shift is drive plane.
[153:43.58]Z is turn.
[153:53.26]Don't, it's not, I know, I'm gonna clear it, I'll clear it.
[153:55.15]Okay, here we go.
[153:56.39]So how do I pull up?
[154:04.02]Let's pull up.
[154:07.32]Oh, wow!
[154:08.50]Apparently that!
[154:29.97]Rico!
[154:31.73]Over here!
[154:36.89]Get big plane.
[154:39.36]Is he talking to me?
[154:46.24]Okay, so W... Why am I not pulling up?
[154:51.17]Why is it not working?
[155:09.93]That did the complete opposite last time.
[155:13.23]Can I ding my head?
[155:13.93]Can I ding my head?
[155:15.29]I sure can.
[155:17.87]I sure can.
[155:19.39]Let's try it again.
[155:39.40]I'm running out of planes.
[155:40.34]It's okay, just... So, S?
[155:43.69]Is it S or W?
[155:48.31]It is W. Or is it S?
[155:54.33]Okay, it's S. And then W is... How in the name of fucking god are you supposed to control... Okay, Z and C is just tilt, like... Okay, I got it.
[156:09.62]Alright, we gotta find a tornado.
[156:20.28]Switch vehicle position.
[156:21.52]This is- what does that do for me?
[156:25.20]Oh, it puts- okay.
[156:46.47]It's still going.
[156:51.49]Don't worry, it'll come back.
[156:55.02]It'll come back and I'll get it.
[156:59.24]Wait a second, hold on.
[157:17.15]Alright, fine, nevermind.
[157:18.65]It just exploded, so I don't know where it exploded, but it did.
[157:21.73]I'm going very fast, alright.
[157:36.97]You thought I was gonna bump on the ground, didn't ya?
[157:39.49]Nope!
[157:41.28]You can't take the big one.
[157:42.22]What are you talking about?
[157:50.72]What the fuck was that?
[157:56.11]What?!
[157:56.93]No!
[157:57.35]I can take a big, huge plane!
[158:02.33]Alright, I'll get- I'll begin to do this in line.
[158:08.32]Oh!
[158:15.10]I'm not doing anything.
[158:17.07]I'm waiting for this other plane to take off before I do anything.
[158:26.59]I can't turn the fucking plane.
[158:30.92]On Earth.
[158:31.48]Almost there.
[158:35.62]Okay, here we go.
[158:36.12]Let's go.
[158:56.37]Okay.
[158:57.49]So, how do I take this?
[158:59.35]This thing is so huge, I don't even know where to go with this.
[159:03.03]How high can I go?
[159:12.38]I'm losing control.
[159:13.14]I don't know if I'm... Am I upside down?
[159:16.98]Am I up or down?
[159:17.64]Does anybody know if I'm up or down?
[159:25.35]think I'm up I can't tell if I'm which way the plane is going I don't know I think we're on which plane are we on are we upside down
[159:39.04]I don't know.
[159:47.51]Alright, let's go this way.
[159:58.04]I am upside down.
[160:02.68]I am upside down.
[160:08.31]Oh, it's still going.
[160:11.17]Why does it keep zooming out?
[160:13.19]Do you see what that's doing?
[160:16.40]Am I at an unreachable place?
[160:20.66]Flat Earth.
[160:24.20]I can't even tell.
[160:29.10]Am I getting closer or further away from this object?
[160:45.19]Oh, this is... the world's coming in too quick.
[161:03.10]Holy shit.
[161:10.46]Okay, I'm starting to be able to see the world in a 3D plane.
[161:13.40]Alright, now I get it!
[161:14.56]Now I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it!
[161:34.99]Give me this fucking thing.
[161:39.07]Alright, well, you got blocked by the sneeze guard.
[161:44.62]One thrust is all it... Alright, I'm ready.
[162:17.92]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[162:19.04]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[162:23.88]Why is this tipping over?
[162:24.64]It's gotta be on the edges like here.
[162:27.17]Okay, I'm ready.
[163:15.95]That's better, right?
[163:22.65]Balloons?
[163:23.09]What do you mean?
[163:26.37]What are you talking about balloons?
[163:29.91]No, no, no.
[163:30.57]Dude, I want to fly, man.
[163:31.64]I want to get going.
[163:32.32]Okay, here we go.
[163:37.15]In three, two, one, let's take it off.
[163:51.93]Where did the... Okay, well... Didn't really do what I thought it was gonna do.
[164:01.75]At least I flew.
[164:10.97]Jetski!
[164:11.97]Thank you!
[164:13.05]I'll take it!
[164:24.31]Come here, come here, come here, come here!
[164:25.76]Okay, come here.
[164:32.56]Oh fuck, that was mean.
[164:35.04]Kind of a mean guy though.
[164:45.90]How can I... Never mind.
[164:47.26]I thought it was a... What are you... Is somebody in that boat?
[165:11.29]Oh...
[165:23.17]What the fuck is this person doing?
[165:25.04]What's wrong with you?
[165:28.54]Why would you drive like this?
[165:30.60]I need to stay on here.
[165:40.66]He's still going.
[165:41.60]Okay.
[165:43.40]At what point are you gonna be done with this?
[165:45.90]I should be asking myself the same question.
[166:01.09]I didn't get her.
[166:02.66]Didn't get her.
[166:03.88]No, sorry.
[166:04.88]You just turned her boat into wood.
[166:15.57]Where's the panel?
[166:16.69]Okay.
[166:18.13]I want the balloon.
[166:18.81]Okay, booster.
[166:24.39]Let's see.
[166:26.16]So what can I do here for airlifter?
[166:29.35]Low, medium, or high airlift.
[166:32.03]Let's try it.
[166:33.46]Let's tap.
[166:36.48]Okay, is this equipped?
[166:51.45]Are you kidding me?
[166:52.63]You're going to let that stop you?
[166:54.03]Okay.
[167:02.55]Let's go, lady.
[167:03.81]You and me.
[167:05.14]On a grand adventure.
[167:13.78]Ooh, there we go!
[167:16.28]There we go!
[167:17.00]I need more up here.
[167:19.42]No, I need them in the back.
[167:20.32]In the back, in the back, in the back.
[167:24.92]Where is she?
[167:25.58]Is she still in the... Is she still here?
[167:26.78]I can't see her.
[167:30.62]I gotta get to some of the back.
[167:37.54]She's still here with me.
[167:38.22]The boat is smoking, but she's still in here.
[167:45.34]Alright, that levels it up.
[167:48.43]Why are we falling?
[167:51.23]Here we go.
[167:57.33]Look at that.
[167:58.49]Get some back here.
[168:09.73]Oh, that hit her in the head.
[168:11.31]How do I take this off?
[168:13.07]How do I take that one off?
[168:15.43]How do I take this one off of her back?
[168:19.95]Oh, there's two.
[168:21.12]There are two inside of her.
[168:28.08]Is she trying to drive?
[168:29.10]How do I get that off?
[168:39.48]Wait, she's attached.
[168:40.90]She's attached.
[168:41.82]I forgot.
[168:42.84]I can't just... How do I get out of here?
[168:54.13]I gotta pick her up.
[169:08.61]I need to get on the bottom of the boat.
[169:12.75]I want on the bottom of the boat, please.
[169:14.43]Oops.
[169:15.05]Oh, fuck.
[169:28.10]I gotta... Bring it down!
[169:32.56]No, bring it down!
[169:43.62]Okay.
[169:46.34]Everything is good.
[169:49.71]Alright, just... You just drive the boat again.
[169:53.13]You were doing a good job driving.
[170:09.34]Why are there three helicopters just hanging out over here?
[170:13.54]I feel like I need to see this.
[170:14.48]I need to get over there.
[170:15.12]I need to understand why they're there.
[170:23.28]Ow.
[170:34.93]What the fuck are they doing?
[170:37.56]It's so bright, but I need to see.
[170:45.99]Ah, I can't even look at it.
[170:47.23]I need to get over there, though.
[170:49.17]They're shooting at each other.
[170:55.67]What are they firing at each other?
[171:03.94]Turn off bloom.
[171:07.43]Hold on.
[171:07.87]Fucking bloom.
[171:23.12]What is it?
[171:23.40]Where's bloom?
[171:24.56]I don't see bloom.
[171:38.82]That's the only... alright.
[171:40.72]Global Illumination?
[171:44.38]Well that didn't do anything.
[171:49.12]I need to see how this plays out.
[171:50.20]Just don't look at the screen for like five minutes.
[171:56.56]Somebody got a hit on someone.
[171:58.01]The middle one took a little damage.
[172:09.53]Aren't these all on the same team?
[172:11.39]Why would they be doing this?
[172:24.58]They're invincible somehow.
[172:44.80]What if I take it?
[172:53.91]Well I was allowed to destroy it somehow.
[173:02.30]What a bunch of fucking idiots.
[173:04.66]I don't know how to fly this.
[173:14.35]Dammit, no!
[173:15.31]Fly it!
[173:15.77]Get in it!
[173:17.19]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[173:44.64]Switch the camera a little bit.
[173:45.68]Is it like a cinematic camera?
[173:47.04]No.
[173:48.02]It's not.
[173:52.52]The propellers are moving too slow?
[173:54.02]Well, that's a scientific reason for that.
[174:06.08]Tornado.
[174:06.72]You got it.
[174:07.08]When was the last time we did a mission?
[174:09.49]I don't remember a mission.
[174:12.47]I need to pitch this a little bit so we can start to get some traction here.
[174:22.26]No more bullets in anything?
[174:23.52]What?
[174:48.04]Oh my fucking god, why am I so stupid?
[175:12.33]Get there!
[175:17.80]No!
[175:18.26]Get there, get there, it's still saveable.
[175:38.00]Press fucking E and I- Oh my god, I hate- I hate it when I do things like that!
[175:44.54]Over here?
[175:56.59]Alright, hijacked vehicle, this one.
[175:57.73]Okay, let's get it.
[176:06.77]grapple to the bottom of the ocean on it, I won't be able to swim back up, man.
[176:19.88]We didn't get to fly into the... Well, to be fair, we probably saved ourselves at least 45 minutes of nothing.
[176:34.21]I was gonna get all the way there.
[176:40.03]to that radar outpost.
[176:41.43]But Mira needs a favor before we leave.
[176:43.21]Where's the guy that I need to hijack?
[176:44.89]See you soon.
[176:45.41]Wasn't there a vehicle?
[176:47.77]Some of those people you freed, they were pilots.
[176:49.95]They volunteered to fly supplies for us.
[176:52.55]Just make sure to break them in before you ask them to drop supplies over a war zone, hmm?
[176:57.83]Eso.
[176:58.91]I'd say, trust me, I know what I'm doing, but we both know that's not true.
[177:09.31]oh fuck you good all right that was a fun little thing now we're all safe I got jumped out of the car why would you jump out of the car
[177:37.61]Why are you jumping out of the car?
[177:40.76]Wait a second.
[177:41.36]Are you gonna jump off the motorcycle?
[177:49.14]You idiot.
[177:49.60]Nice bike.
[178:11.92]Can you do a wheelie?
[178:26.83]I was trying to fucking crush that guy.
[178:52.44]I can't take this button.
[178:55.96]Okay.
[178:56.18]Hydrate.
[179:08.43]I'm not looking at chat ever again for the rest of my life.
[179:11.71]Never.
[179:12.33]For the rest of my whole life.
[179:28.70]That's fair.
[179:29.46]I'm just kidding.
[179:45.51]Airport nearby.
[179:46.21]No, I gotta do a mission.
[179:47.15]I have to do something.
[179:48.71]We've been doing dog shit for the last, like, two straight hours.
[179:52.59]I don't even know what the first mission of the game is.
[179:56.76]Is this traversable?
[179:58.75]Yep.
[180:11.06]That's the point of the game.
[180:12.18]Well, yeah, right?
[180:13.50]I mean...
[180:32.95]The lady got up!
[180:37.42]Whatever.
[180:37.74]Lady did so many spins.
[180:43.83]She didn't even get a hit.
[180:45.57]She just pretended to get hit.
[181:02.10]What exploded?
[181:06.75]Why was there an explosion?
[181:13.33]Alright, let go away this way.
[181:21.66]Start the lava project.
[181:37.82]Why is it telling me to go the other way?
[181:39.10]I'm going the right way, right?
[181:43.14]I don't think a Subaru Outback is gonna make it over here.
[182:08.43]What?
[182:11.71]I'm trying to get in the car.
[182:15.75]I'm trying to just die.
[182:27.06]Alright, I want the car back.
[182:29.18]Give it to me.
[182:33.30]Give me the car back.
[182:34.54]There's one balloon popped.
[182:37.03]Two balloons popped.
[182:37.91]How many is it gonna take?
[182:39.15]Last one coming in?
[182:39.99]I'm trying to...
[183:08.80]I don't even know where this is trying to tell me to go.
[183:12.42]Scripted.
[183:13.28]Well yeah, that one was.
[183:14.20]It's so much safer to do this.
[183:26.72]This is all the way across the map.
[183:36.96]Holy shit, thank god.
[183:41.00]This is really that far away.
[183:42.14]Oh my fucking god, why am I going here?
[183:47.83]Why did I decide that this was a good idea?
[183:53.25]Okay, um... Anyways, I think that instead of that... Get there by a plane?
[184:04.13]Now you're thinking.
[184:06.23]Now you're thinking.
[184:19.82]End of stream voice?
[184:20.96]What?
[184:21.30]What are you talking about?
[184:25.54]Wait, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[184:33.87]I heard it?
[184:34.37]What do you mean you heard it?
[184:40.44]I'm not stopping the stream right now.
[184:49.05]Alright, this time we're gonna get there quick with a plane.
[184:55.33]Good night.
[185:00.05]Alright.
[185:01.19]Plane.
[185:02.57]Not a big one, just a little one.
[185:03.81]Just one big enough to get us where we want to go.
[185:05.87]There's one right here.
[185:09.87]No!
[185:10.19]The stream's not ending!
[185:18.86]There we go.
[185:19.56]Let's move.
[185:23.02]This will get us there very quickly.
[185:38.34]There we go.
[185:39.74]Straighten it out.
[185:40.40]Don't go upside down.
[185:43.32]Just get there and be fine.
[185:47.13]No, I'm not going to fly upside down again.
[185:52.82]Press E for turbo.
[185:53.92]You know, that would be very interesting if that existed.
[185:57.24]But it just doesn't.
[185:58.06]I'm sorry.
[186:03.05]Fly upside down into the tornado.
[186:04.89]And there's a dino that's a tornado, but don't get me distracted.
[186:18.60]Hold E and get on the roof.
[186:23.24]I'm only going to try this.
[186:24.12]No.
[186:30.71]Hold E and get on the roof.
[186:35.09]What does L mean?
[186:36.75]What do you mean L?
[186:38.97]L?
[186:41.36]L!
[186:44.46]Oh.
[186:48.81]I had to press up.
[186:49.47]Alright, that's kinda cool.
[186:54.59]That's cool.
[186:56.05]Alright.
[187:02.88]Can I make it through?
[187:04.40]You think I can get through the tornado?
[187:05.24]What do you think?
[187:06.76]Ooh, already a struggle.
[187:10.08]I made it.
[187:17.09]I'm good.
[187:20.54]Currently, am I outrunning it?
[187:22.58]Yeah.
[187:24.50]I got through.
[187:29.59]Pretty good nauseous stream.
[187:33.89]Alright, that was a good stream.
[187:35.41]Alright, time to go home.
[187:39.83]Just kidding.
[187:46.48]Okay, almost there.
[187:48.28]Start the Elapa project.
[187:54.91]How come this doesn't have a horn?
[188:01.75]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[188:02.67]I should probably do something about that, right?
[188:09.41]Press E for horn.
[188:11.33]E?
[188:13.56]Can I walk on this?
[188:15.91]Yeah, you can.
[188:16.44]Okay.
[188:16.58]I can, like, walk around up here.
[188:18.36]Can I go on the wing?
[188:19.02]This is so dumb.
[188:25.56]Wow, don't do that.
[188:30.85]Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're losing it.
[188:32.01]We're losing it.
[188:32.51]We're losing it all.
[188:36.98]I gotta go there.
[188:47.86]See, if this was a real plane, this would just hit me right in the face.
[188:57.18]Okay, see you later.
[188:59.73]We're gonna go... this way.
[189:09.81]End of the plane voice.
[189:11.03]Yeah, end of the plane voice.
[189:14.34]What did you do?
[189:19.43]oh my goodness okay here we are all right okay so I think okay I okay so looks like uh I mean I'm just gonna piss I'll be right back

[192:53.45]All right, back.
[193:01.47]All right, so that brings us to... That brings us, unfortunately here, to the... I can't, people are gonna actually leave.
[193:20.58]A bunch of people are probably gonna leave.
[193:26.42]People just see that in the image and they just leave.
[193:33.71]I probably shouldn't do that.
[193:34.83]That's like not even like... Okay, so... How do I do this?
[193:47.58]Oh, it's over there.
[193:53.38]Right here.
[193:57.47]40 people just left.
[193:58.67]Damn it.
[193:58.97]Whatever.
[193:59.39]It's alright.
[193:59.95]200 people left.
[194:00.63]It's alright.
[194:01.15]Pilots?
[194:01.39]You guys- I thought you guys were giving me shit.
[194:30.48]Request... Home to the free spirit of freethink people of... Request travel.
[194:37.66]Select an available pilot.
[194:38.74]Each pilot will need to refuel after their flight, making them unavailable.
[194:51.45]Oh.
[194:53.77]Yes!
[194:55.17]EC's waiting for you on the roof of the Batista building.
[194:58.75]On my way.
[195:00.73]Do you know what would be funny right now?
[195:01.88]If German didn't open his parachute and he just landed on the ground.
[195:05.60]Right?
[195:05.96]You know what I'm saying?
[195:06.76]Where the fuck do you want me to go?
[195:08.06]Oh.
[195:33.38]No, I need to be izzy, not m- Close.
[196:10.17]I'll get there eventually, don't worry.
[196:12.86]Alright, I need a chopper.
[196:17.16]Oh, but there really is a supply drop.
[196:22.24]I can't fucking believe it.
[196:37.47]Edit, uh... Open the supply drop menu with three.
[196:41.79]Pick an available pilot and edit their loadout.
[196:48.04]Oh my god.
[196:50.46]Civilian vehicles... Okay.
[196:53.28]A car, please.

[197:21.36]Listo just got here sending you coordinates Why is he Nice city for city always been that way
[197:38.01]Do you think I can jump out and then grab and come back in?
[197:41.61]You don't think so?
[197:42.37]Who is driving this?
[198:21.44]What?
[198:22.12]I can't fly this thing.
[198:26.58]What?
[198:27.24]I can't fly this thing.
[198:31.38]What?
[198:32.06]I can't fly this thing.
[198:35.08]What?
[198:35.76]I can't fly this thing.
[198:38.19]I can't get back in.
[198:43.73]I made it.
[198:55.64]I don't know who was flying that before, but that was weird.
[199:07.43]I can't fly this thing.
[199:09.63]Can she fly this thing?
[199:12.07]No, it's a radio, right?
[199:15.80]Gracias.
[199:16.88]What does she want for her station?
[199:22.26]Oh, Erica!
[199:24.60]Oh, what does every song ever made in 2010 be on?
[199:44.92]Listen!
[200:16.36]HERE IT COMES!
[200:18.00]Alright, let's go.
[200:22.29]Nice.
[200:57.11]Oh shit, can she die?
[200:58.63]I thought she was immune.
[201:12.69]This is taking us a long time.
[201:21.06]Boosters?
[201:22.94]No, but that'll ruin everything.
[201:27.78]Now she's not gonna move.
[201:28.88]Why have you guys told me to do this?
[201:46.54]She'll make it eventually.
[202:08.35]Look at all these hackers.
[202:14.82]But none of that matters unless we can disable Yappa's defenses.
[202:18.20]Easy and I have been working on that.
[202:22.50]All of these facilities house prototype weather cores and each core is connected to Yappa's defense network.
[202:29.26]Did you know he's telling it's a hacker?
[202:31.77]When they're inside the server room.
[202:33.79]You don't have to be in there.
[202:34.71]You could be like in your bedroom.
[202:46.25]It's so hot in there.
[202:48.43]You know how hot one server gets?
[202:50.99]They have server farms in fucking Antarctica because it gets so hot in there.
[202:55.39]You can't physically be inside this room.
[202:57.44]Mira, here.
[202:58.92]Gracias, easy.
[203:00.50]What's that?
[203:01.68]Information on a place called La Masmora.
[203:03.98]It's a prison hidden in the desert.
[203:06.72]Yeah, that's true.
[203:09.47]I think my uncle Lanza might still be alive.
[203:11.45]And if he is, he's being held there.
[203:15.13]And, uh... He can help us get into Zona Uno?
[203:18.77]He helped your father build Project Yappa.
[203:22.49]Here, if he's still alive, I'll find him.
[203:25.53]Just lower the temperature of the room.
[203:27.27]Good luck!
[203:28.45]Here?
[203:29.45]He's on a trace.
[203:30.99]According to Izzy, he's not on the network, but I have an old friend, Cesar.
[203:34.99]He has a theory that might help us.
[203:37.36]Then let's hear what he has to say.
[203:39.77]And this is Sono Dos.
[203:42.35]We don't know much about that facility.
[203:45.17]Are you ever going to answer this?
[203:47.19]I'm not an agency man anymore.
[203:49.71]Rico, those coordinates are close.
[203:52.21]Look.
[203:55.60]That can't be a coincidence.
[203:56.72]Like I was just on a normal NPC routine.
[203:58.70]I'll check it out.
[204:00.08]Just carrying a box.
[204:00.68]I'm sending you all the data you'll need to your AR links.
[204:03.54]Good.
[204:04.84]Let's start hitting Oscar where it hurts.
[204:08.93]I skipped that at the end of the cutscene, but that's okay.
[204:10.73]Okay, here we go.
[204:12.71]Bingo.
[204:13.91]I accomplished it.
[204:24.90]Let's take out their satellite!
[204:29.26]In fact, that might even be our satellite, but take it out anyways.
[204:36.40]Not hacking in that room anymore, are you?
[204:37.98]Alright, so now... There's a wingsuit mission right here.
[204:43.44]What do I have to do about that?
[204:48.97]What is this?
[204:51.37]Wingsuit stunt.
[204:57.87]How do I do that?
[205:02.22]Like, fly through that in a wingsuit?
[205:17.85]I did it!
[205:18.13]Oh, my leg!
[205:21.07]I gotta go through the whole thing.
[205:23.19]Okay, hold on.
[205:29.26]So, how am I supposed to be able to see that?
[205:34.26]You know what I mean?
[205:38.11]I gotta start from all the way back here, then.
[205:41.69]So, turn this way.
[205:47.68]Here we go.
[205:51.75]One.
[205:53.59]Two.
[205:54.21]No.
[205:58.54]I have to activate it up there.
[206:02.90]I'm not even doing it right.
[206:04.22]I have to actually be in a helicopter and activate it up there.
[206:24.97]Give me 5 seconds!
[206:28.72]How the hell?
[206:35.08]Wait, what?
[206:35.50]Chat?
[206:35.70]No.
[206:36.34]Chat?
[206:36.70]No.
[206:37.00]What do you mean chat?
[206:37.92]No.
[206:38.14]What happened?
[206:39.60]I need to be going way faster than that.
[206:43.61]What about, like, this?
[206:44.65]Can I just... I have to be up in the air.
[206:53.69]I just locked myself in a fucking prison.
[206:57.07]Can I grab that from here?
[207:09.09]No.
[207:16.81]Don't take your rage out on that guy.
[207:18.41]Rage?
[207:23.31]Oh fuck it, I don't even care.
[207:24.53]I'm gonna get like 15 points.
[207:25.96]Alright, where the hell am I going now?
[207:35.30]I feel like I... I feel like there's something else I need to do.
[207:45.80]Request travel.
[207:47.90]No, wait, what?
[207:51.84]I can just go there?
[207:58.77]I gotta get this waypoint marker off.
[208:03.38]Go back to the tornado?
[208:04.72]No.
[208:07.98]Okay, here we go.
[208:12.49]Track this one.
[208:26.39]Fly time.
[208:27.13]Wingsuit.
[208:27.61]If I crash, I'll turn the stream off.
[208:31.68]That's how you know I'm not going to.
[208:42.14]You guys don't have that much confidence in my ability at all, huh?
[208:45.99]Ah, goodnight everybody.
[208:46.81]No.
[208:46.95]Thought I was gonna crash right there, didn't you?
[208:53.17]I'm gonna go through this weird valley here.
[208:57.32]What's this?
[209:01.20]Whoa, oh shit, he's gonna turn the stream off.
[209:04.20]What the fuck?
[209:28.79]Escape?
[209:29.65]Who am I being chased by?
[209:33.33]Oh, here it comes!
[209:34.81]Here comes the beat!
[209:35.83]Who am I escaping from?
[209:38.93]Who am I chasing?
[210:13.40]Adios!
[210:16.42]No!
[210:23.29]No!
[210:28.59]Fucking E!
[210:30.39]E!
[210:31.15]E!
[210:32.03]E!
[210:32.63]Oh I'm so annoyed right now.
[210:34.23]Has this whole country lost its mind?
[210:43.94]Oh my goodness gracious, just get over here.
[210:46.34]Where the fuck is that J?
[211:05.59]Get off!
[211:06.15]Get off!
[211:06.75]Señor, por favor, I have nothing against your revolución.
[211:14.09]Turn the fucking radio off.
[211:14.93]I am going to press E here because I want to go across.
[212:03.14]Wingsuit in the water.
[212:04.18]I just gotta get close enough where I can grab the edge.
[212:15.95]Okay.
[212:16.73]We are getting close.
[212:28.03]I keep trying to just go as fast as I can.
[212:38.73]How far away is this for real?
[212:40.15]I'm so fucking far away.
[212:41.89]I really am not supposed to get in a car and drive there, seriously.
[212:51.11]How am I ever going to traverse this?
[213:00.00]What the fuck?
[213:02.16]Jesus!
[213:03.74]Why?
[213:04.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[213:06.30]What the hell was that?
[213:56.43]I'm almost there.
[214:07.12]There it is!
[214:09.16]Something exploded!
[214:13.42]Is this on low settings?
[214:14.57]No.
[214:16.53]Not yet.
[214:26.22]We're so close.
[214:30.64]This isn't low settings?
[214:31.80]No it's not.
[214:52.45]Made it to your house.
[214:59.74]I hope that wasn't an NPC giver.
[215:01.78]Whatever the fucking quest giver.
[215:03.08]You must be Rodriguez.
[215:04.76]Revolutionary.
[215:06.02]You must be Javi.
[215:07.22]I am not.
[215:08.08]There's little time to explain.
[215:09.28]Javi said you would be able to bring him the equipment he needs.
[215:13.00]Did he?
[215:13.76]The Black Hand have confiscated his things over by the waterfall.
[215:23.15]Alright, so what's the mission here?
[215:24.89]Reach the waterfall cave.
[215:25.71]If you defeat them, you can take his equipment to him at the Tomb of Suma.
[215:29.75]No, I can't just shoot everybody.
[215:31.07]It's not funny.
[215:32.09]Alright, I need to get up there.
[215:33.37]Reach the waterfall cave.
[215:34.95]You got it.
[215:35.33]Leave immediately, senor.
[215:52.40]You cannot be here.
[216:08.18]stuff down here, right?
[216:09.02]Nice.
[216:12.67]Take the retract motor.
[216:20.70]What do I get for this?
[216:29.58]I knew unlockable.
[216:30.20]Do I get to, is this a tracking device?
[216:34.17]Approach the cave doors.
[216:35.93]Okay.
[216:38.03]Retractor.
[216:48.54]What the fuck does this do?
[216:51.38]Set the retract force to high in the auto column.
[216:54.40]Okay.
[216:57.74]It'll work automatically after releasing.
[216:59.24]Okay.
[217:00.54]Alright.
[217:05.80]Open the door.
[217:06.96]Am I supposed to just pull this?
[217:18.86]Hold, I don't get it.
[217:20.50]Aim at the door and hold to start tether, okay?
[217:22.40]Aim at the wall and release tether.
[217:24.09]Like this wall.
[217:28.87]Oh, it just pulls the door.
[217:29.83]Alright, I thought it was gonna do something else.
[217:34.01]I was expecting it to be something else.
[217:35.99]That's just a regular tether.
[217:39.28]Aim at the other door.
[217:40.06]Do I really have to do that?
[217:44.14]This is some place, Javi.
[217:47.26]An aqueduct.
[217:48.92]At least six centuries old.
[217:51.15]Oh shit, I gotta fly this little go-kart.
[217:55.93]I promise, I will explain everything.
[217:58.85]There's a map inside the plane.
[218:00.29]You can get my coordinates from there.
[218:04.40]This thing's kind of cool, actually.
[218:07.82]I had to open both doors to get this little thing out of there.
[218:11.10]What is exploding over there?
[218:12.32]Stop blowing things up over there, you dummies.
[218:31.06]I made allies in prison.
[218:33.51]People who'd seen the cracks in the facade.
[218:36.69]Now they help me uncover the truth.
[218:38.99]And what do you need me for?
[218:41.43]I believe I have discovered the path to the tomb of Otorongo.
[218:45.07]Last ruler of the Priespinoza people of Solis.
[218:47.47]I wonder what's in there.
[218:48.61]According to the history books, Otorongo was executed for countless murders.
[218:53.67]But I believe the reality is more complex.
[218:56.11]Did I just GTA spawn the same car like four times?
[218:58.52]That's dangerous.
[219:00.01]What the hell was that?
[219:05.49]Alright.
[219:06.91]Should I make it all low settings and then put the title and everything on ultra?
[219:11.03]Like, just cause for gameplay.
[219:13.30]Ultra settings.
[219:14.28]PC, 1080p, 60fps.
[219:15.06]Do I have to land this?
[219:16.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:17.88]Do I have to land this?
[219:20.34]How do I land this?
[219:21.32]How do I land this?
[219:22.56]Do I have to land this there?
[219:23.76]Excuse me.
[219:30.98]How do I land my hovercraft?
[219:33.49]Oh, fuck, I have to land this there.
[219:35.67]Um... I don't know how am I supposed to land this there.
[219:46.54]I'll try.
[219:47.02]This fucking Pee-wee Herman did this in one of his movies.
[219:52.18]I'm certain of it.
[220:15.27]Oh boy!
[220:21.79]I thought I just failed the mission.
[220:39.89]It was a landing strip?
[220:41.29]Oh, your stash is safe.
[220:42.70]Anything else that you'd like to say?
[220:44.42]Sweat.
[220:44.64]Sweat stains.
[220:45.28]It's a relic.
[220:45.72]A figure of Otorongo.
[220:47.72]Mid-16th century.
[221:08.36]Wait, is that... There was a... There was a mission here.
[221:17.88]Okay.
[221:19.00]Retract the ancient lever.
[221:23.46]Ancient lever is down here.
[221:24.93]Yeah.
[221:25.99]Okay.
[221:27.61]That object is why we need to retract Motorico.
[221:30.47]I believe it is connected to underground machinery.
[221:36.19]Put the giant cartoon lever down.
[221:39.70]That sounded like... something.
[221:41.68]I see it.
[221:44.41]A giant head.
[221:45.71]Rico, follow it.
[221:47.99]I can tell what kind of day this is going to be.
[221:50.75]Oh.
[221:51.55]Okay.
[221:53.61]Can I get on top of it?
[221:56.41]Can I just run with this thing?
[221:57.65]Come on, let me do like the cartoon log thing.
[222:01.85]Um, I don't... I'm on it.
[222:08.07]I was.
[222:11.19]that Uma is an ancient sculpture of an honored person.
[222:14.03]This one may be Sumac's visage.
[222:17.53]Avi, big guy and I are at the floor of the cave.
[222:21.47]What do you see?
[222:23.91]There's a mechanism in the ground.
[222:26.30]Looks about the same size as the head.
[222:29.22]It's a giant lock, Rico.
[222:30.80]The Uma is the key.
[222:32.68]Can you use the retract to get the Uma to the mechanism?
[222:36.58]Why not?
[222:45.45]I'll try.
[222:45.89]I'll get it.
[222:51.47]It'll get in there.
[222:52.28]Perfectly fine.
[222:52.84]Just small injuries.
[223:12.76]That hit me right in the fucking head too.
[223:24.68]Fine, I'll do it the dumb way.
[223:26.15]I'll do it the way that you want me to do it.
[223:28.27]Video game.
[223:31.29]Come on over here!
[223:32.19]Get in there!
[223:42.43]If something happened, a door opened up.
[223:45.51]This is a Nickelodeon game show.
[223:47.57]Where Sumac sleeps eternal.
[223:50.52]Rico, please.
[223:59.58]Where he sleeps eternal.
[224:01.02]There's a human skull with a candle inside.
[224:03.28]Light it and be ready for anything.
[224:06.96]I lit it.
[224:11.66]There's text on the wall.
[224:13.37]What the fuck happened?
[224:14.23]I'm buried.
[224:15.07]Only five beds remain.
[224:17.49]That mean anything to you?
[224:18.51]No.
[224:20.01]Get this thing open.
[224:21.31]It sounds like a single line from a longer text.
[224:24.89]There must be more.
[224:25.47]Get it open.
[224:26.77]If it's gonna screw over Espinosa, count me in.
[224:30.79]Bueno.
[224:31.69]Others close to Otorongo will likely have the other lines.
[224:34.47]The tombs of his family.
[224:35.87]His advisors.
[224:37.43]I'll keep my eyes open.
[224:42.27]Help him uncover the truth.
[224:44.23]Seek out the hidden tombs of Otorongo's family and advisors.
[224:48.13]Helping him, an associate will earn you mod points.
[224:51.33]That's good.
[225:03.77]Everyone thought I was stuck.
[225:05.01]Sorry, I'm not stuck.
[225:06.66]I'm absolutely fine.
[225:07.94]But, if you don't think I'm gonna take this thing for a balloon ride, you're out of your mind.
[225:27.65]I'd say we probably make sure it's balanced.
[225:31.68]Otherwise this whole thing's gonna start turning around.
[225:33.32]I need to just in... Just make a circle.
[225:46.59]Fire it up like a slingshot.
[225:47.85]How many of these can I have?
[225:49.01]10?
[225:49.07]Is 10 maximum?
[225:49.53]Yeah.
[225:56.86]Away we go.
[226:02.93]Oh my goodness.
[226:03.77]I can't.
[226:15.84]He's not gonna go.
[226:28.04]Put boosters underneath it.
[226:32.54]I mean, it's going to fly all over the place, but I'll try it.
[226:35.58]Can I move it with my hands?
[226:40.16]No.
[226:42.76]Alright, so here's what's going to have to happen.
[226:43.92]I'm going to put... Let's get up there.
[226:47.55]Let's put balloons... Come on, stay up there, dude.
[226:51.95]Okay, let's balloon it to get it off the ground.
[227:00.71]Once it's off the ground, we'll put the crusters underneath.
[227:08.53]Okay.
[227:09.29]Crusters are A. Don't hit me, please.
[227:15.55]God, this is gonna be hard to do this without getting crushed.
[227:38.66]It's reaching the height limit.
[227:40.72]With these on it, it definitely will not.
[227:42.80]It'll go flying through fucking air.
[227:45.70]What am I doing?
[227:46.52]Hold on to my spine!
[227:55.08]What?
[227:58.36]I don't get it.
[227:58.80]What the hell?
[228:09.30]Is it not on anymore?
[228:10.12]Hold on, was it?
[228:18.12]The wrong fucking thing was on.
[228:19.44]God damn it, really.
[228:20.18]I thought it was A. Let's go.
[228:50.90]Alright, here we go!
[228:56.71]Change the height limit?
[228:58.95]Change height limit?
[229:02.27]Does it have- does it- on the balloons?
[229:06.75]Yeah, but I mean, I have these things on right now.
[229:08.93]Shouldn't that not even matter anymore?
[229:15.21]Height limit.
[229:17.37]Air lifter.
[229:18.76]I mean, it's... Where do I do that?
[229:25.78]This is retractor.
[229:30.30]Loadout B controlled.
[229:31.24]How the fuck do I... Edit mods, right?
[229:33.24]Okay.
[229:34.74]Peak altitude is at medium.
[229:38.29]No limit.
[229:38.73]Okay.
[229:40.03]Okay.
[229:47.64]So then I should just get on top of it then.
[230:01.28]Oh, fuck.
[230:03.12]I just got hit by the ball.
[230:05.46]Whoa!
[230:13.34]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[230:20.10]Let's just try to do it with balloons now.
[230:23.14]Because if the height limit is off, then maybe I can just fly out.
[230:29.60]Right?
[230:29.74]Wouldn't that make sense?
[230:38.23]Oh, fuck.
[230:39.83]Jesus, I didn't know it was gonna happen this quickly.
[230:41.31]Fuck!
[230:44.95]Oh, no!
[230:55.13]Oh, I went so high so quickly.
[230:57.13]All right, where is it?
[231:01.57]Where's the ball?
[231:07.83]Okay, I deleted all the, there it comes, okay.
[231:14.31]Am I out of the way?
[231:16.37]I don't know if I'm in the way or not.
[231:17.96]Nope, I'm good.
[231:23.05]asteroid.
[231:24.57]Alright, let's settle down, settle down.
[231:28.19]I didn't know it was going to happen that quickly.
[231:29.54]I've got to do it in the right place.
[231:30.74]I've got to find the center of the ball.
[231:37.72]This is fine right here.
[231:39.38]Right in the nose.
[231:39.98]Okay, now wait a second before I do anything else.
[231:51.05]Oh, no.
[231:51.49]Right here.
[231:53.30]Oh shit!
[232:14.10]What?
[232:16.24]What?
[232:20.03]We're still going up.
[232:21.77]We're still going.
[232:23.67]Through the clouds.
[232:31.39]I don't think we've even started a descent.
[232:33.15]I don't think there is a descent.
[232:35.67]Oh, yes there is.
[232:36.21]Oh, fuck.
[232:36.69]It's descending.
[232:38.08]It's going fast.
[232:38.96]I got another balloon.
[232:40.20]Another balloon?
[232:45.24]We're going really fast!
[232:49.39]We're going so fast, I can't even fucking do anything.
[232:52.88]Whoa!
[232:54.12]What?!
[232:59.16]That just went a thousand miles per hour!
[233:04.26]Oh my god!
[233:12.67]That speed was just increasing the whole time.
[233:17.13]Where is it though?
[233:19.19]Let me see it.
[233:25.89]Is it- did it fall back down?
[233:34.98]No, it's gone.
[233:35.46]Did it land in the jungle?
[233:39.13]Fuck, really?
[233:50.27]I don't see it anywhere.
[233:52.05]It's gone.
[233:52.41]Oh well, that was fun.
[233:59.32]That thing did not have a terminal velocity.
[234:00.68]It just kept going faster and faster.
[234:02.52]It's in the hole.
[234:05.32]No, it's not.
[234:20.68]That's not, that's not it.
[234:22.72]It's not in the hole.
[234:26.52]Really?
[234:27.44]I went all the fucking way back down here.
[234:47.99]What the fuck?
[234:50.75]Where did you guys even come from?
[234:54.05]Why did a fucking hundred animals just spawn?
[234:59.85]What are you people doing?
[235:01.47]What are you doing?
[235:14.86]Save him!
[235:15.32]Oh shit, save him!
[235:16.18]I can save him, you're right!
[235:17.68]Hold on, I can save him.
[235:18.43]Where's the balloon?
[235:21.49]Alright, save.
[235:29.33]Are you telling me the water is too strong for this?
[235:35.50]What's it gonna take to pull you out of here, man?
[235:38.08]Why are you connected to the... Get him out!
[235:41.72]Get him out!
[235:43.00]Get him...
[235:58.72]Oh, is he gonna fall back down?
[236:06.93]The theory would be he would be falling back down, right?
[236:32.65]Okay, I'm fucking being a psycho.
[236:34.49]I gotta get out of this cave.
[236:42.82]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[236:45.06]Oh yeah, throw animals in the air with a balloon and shoot them.
[236:57.23]What the hell do I even have to do now?
[236:59.73]Okay, we've got, uh... Helicopter stunt.
[237:06.30]Speed stunt.
[237:10.64]Find the rock or riot.
[237:12.30]Alright, hold on.
[237:12.88]Let me do this first.
[237:13.68]It's gonna be un-fucking-bearable.
[237:25.41]You guys understand that, right?
[237:57.90]I can't even fit it on here.
[238:02.41]Oh my fucking god, it really looks like a Nintendo 64 game.
[238:19.96]I need to change the title.
[238:28.53]I'm gonna change the title to, like, Just Cause 4.
[238:32.41]Just Cause 4.
[238:34.55]Uh... 3DS.
[238:34.89]3DS.
[238:55.79]This is a lie, though.
[238:57.13]How long can I keep this up?
[238:58.97]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[239:02.13]We're going to take this a little bit further.
[239:04.23]Hold on.
[239:09.11]I'm going to put a 3DS on the screen.
[239:19.30]OK.
[239:19.82]I need just like a nice open 3DS image.
[239:27.77]All right, that looks pretty good.
[239:30.91]Yeah, this one looks pretty good.
[239:32.29]Let's see if we can get it on there.
[239:35.99]Yeah, OK.
[239:40.40]Save image.
[239:48.22]OK.
[239:49.82]Did it work?
[239:51.22]Can you see it?
[239:58.40]Okay Just give me a moment
[240:31.83]It needs to be a little bit bigger.
[240:32.95]It needs to be a little bigger.
[240:38.26]You know what I mean?
[240:38.94]Like, I can't just be that.
[240:39.96]Like, anyway, like, that's a little bit better.
[240:58.26]Alright, that looks pretty good.
[240:59.30]Maybe a little bit lower to get the edge there.
[241:17.97]Facecam on the bottom?
[241:19.49]I don't have my facecam plugged in.
[241:32.53]Do it!
[241:33.01]I- I can't!
[241:35.93]No, we need, like, a picture of Super Mario.
[241:42.18]And this actually feels really good on the 3DS.
[241:43.90]Something I was, uh, kind of shocked to see.
[241:47.93]You know, I've been in games journalism for a long time, but man, the 3DS version, this does hold up.
[241:52.57]This is a clean 60 FPS.
[242:06.14]Put a one-minute delayed video of Just Cause on the bottom.
[242:11.08]No, no, no, no.
[242:11.67]Guys, what are you talking about here?
[242:13.31]Hold on.
[242:13.63]Why don't you just... Excuse me.
[242:15.65]If this was not a fucking bullshit joke... Print screen, please.
[242:22.39]This is... The map is down there.
[242:23.85]If this is going to be legitimate, it's got to be legitimate then.
[242:35.87]Okay, let me just open up Paint.
[242:36.89]Alright.
[242:51.26]Too bad I can't just, like, record... me.
[242:56.08]No, that's gonna- that would take so long.
[242:59.74]Okay, save as, PNG, that looks fine.
[243:08.81]We're gonna have to shrink this a little more.
[243:10.09]Okay, how does that look?
[243:29.65]It's a little skewed.
[243:35.46]It's because this is tilted, so...
[243:48.22]It doesn't fit that well.
[243:50.84]I need to angle it?
[243:51.82]I can't angle it.
[244:00.29]Tilt it in paint?
[244:03.31]You- I can tilt that in paint.
[244:05.45]What?
[244:07.50]How the fuck do you do that?
[244:19.30]Free transform it into a trapezoid The skew tool?
[244:32.10]Skew?
[244:37.62]I see rotate, resize, crop
[244:43.68]Resize.
[244:45.05]Skew!
[244:46.67]What?
[244:48.27]Skew at how many degrees?
[244:49.43]Like 10?
[244:50.57]No.
[244:57.92]Minus 5.
[245:02.32]Vertical?
[245:02.72]We should go vertical, right?
[245:06.64]So we need a vertical skew of like 5.
[245:13.17]That kind of fucks it all up, though.
[245:17.57]What about this at 5?
[245:18.37]Nah, that's kind of fucked up looking.
[245:29.84]Uh, no, that doesn't work.
[245:35.04]Can I skew an OBS?
[245:39.75]Let's see.
[245:43.21]I don't think I can.
[245:55.60]Maybe filter?
[246:00.26]No.
[246:01.56]No, that's just the way it is.
[246:02.92]Just gonna have to be like this.
[246:07.62]Just use the 2DS.
[246:11.43]Oops-a-daisy.
[246:14.31]Well, it's just gonna have to be like this.
[246:21.32]Shift and grab?
[246:22.90]No, shift-grab just does that.
[246:25.24]That's alright.
[246:29.10]Close enough.
[246:32.92]Wait, I need hands too, though.
[246:43.49]What the fuck?
[246:44.39]Okay, hold on.
[246:52.16]Save image.
[246:55.18]Hand.
[246:58.00]Right on the desktop, that's fine.
[246:59.60]Okay, hold on.
[247:01.35]Oh, fuck, it's not keyed out, though.
[247:04.05]No, it's not going to work.
[247:04.71]Never mind.
[247:12.59]Nevermind, it's too much.
[247:17.72]What did I just do?
[247:18.98]Oh, did I just delete it?
[247:26.67]Did I just like exit the game?
[247:37.82]This is very hard to play this, but let's play, here we go.
[247:44.42]Holy fuck, I actually got it!
[247:46.14]Fire from the O!
[247:58.59]You play looking at OVS?
[248:00.07]No, I'm playing on the big screen that looks like... It's just so much alicing, it's unbelievable.
[248:06.85]Alright, let's go do a mission.
[248:16.22]It's so hard to point this, I don't even know where the cursor is.
[248:37.29]Watch at 160p for the authentic experience.
[248:43.32]I need to pick a mission.
[248:47.52]Here's one.
[248:48.17]I can't read that.
[248:50.01]Let me try as hard as I can.
[248:51.91]Agency distress beacon.
[248:54.47]An agency distress signal has pinged who grappling hook over since the two for phone at Elapa.
[249:08.90]That can't be evidence loves when the source of the beacon.
[249:18.81]All right, you got it.
[249:27.08]What happened to my momentum?
[249:28.68]Oh!
[249:30.06]Where's my fucking momentum?
[249:33.08]Whatever.
[249:36.62]Okay, that was odd.
[249:42.04]Can I get on your car?
[249:43.54]Or is it not gonna let me do this?
[249:46.63]Right, okay, that, yeah, sure, I'll take this one.
[249:48.63]That sounds like a fun place, that sounds good.
[249:52.65]Like, the 3DS port really is, like, just a little too buggy for me, I think.
[250:06.43]Gotta go this way.
[250:13.68]Turn on music.
[250:16.20]The game honestly looks better like this.
[250:24.60]Uh, I'm gonna tend to disagree here.
[250:31.64]That's not authentic, though.
[250:32.86]Hold on.
[250:36.65]Give me one more second.
[250:41.94]Because that's not authentic.
[250:45.70]It's about to be, though.
[250:48.04]Okay.
[250:53.45]We need one of these.
[251:04.98]Hold on a second.
[251:18.25]Let's see how that sounds.
[251:21.02]Another little bit here.
[251:23.00]Hold on.
[251:26.17]Okay.
[251:27.93]Tell me how that changes things.
[251:29.91]Wow!
[252:05.35]go worse I need I need to know what that sounds like man hold on what did that sound like see how that sounds another little bit here hold on I'm not gonna put this loud I just need to know what it sounded like okay tell me how that changes things
[252:35.88]Just, it didn't change anything.
[252:40.10]It didn't change fucking anything, it just made it extremely loud.
[252:47.63]Hold on.
[252:55.57]That's why.
[253:04.05]Okay.
[253:05.31]Let's see what that does.
[253:12.78]Is that different?
[253:13.64]Does that sound different?
[253:24.82]The link?
[253:25.38]What do you mean the link?
[253:26.70]What do you want for the link?
[253:29.52]What are you guys linking me?
[253:34.43]Somebody just did it.
[253:36.18]Somebody made it.
[253:37.18]Why?
[253:37.96]Well, hold on.
[254:01.18]Alright, well, let's get rid of everything else but this.
[254:04.38]Oh my god.
[254:22.91]How's that?
[254:23.45]A little bit more down.
[254:29.73]That looks pretty good.
[254:33.39]Maybe a little bit up and to the right?
[254:41.88]How does this sound?
[254:47.27]Cap it to 30 frames a second.
[254:49.33]Oh my god, I don't think I can.
[254:51.13]I don't think I can do that.
[255:01.25]Scale resolution, hold on.
[255:04.19]I don't think I can do that.
[255:06.19]Filters.
[255:10.13]Scaling aspect ratio.
[255:15.71]I can do it in OBS, but I'll have to turn the stream off.
[255:19.58]Set my monitor's refresh rate to 30.
[255:27.66]Do it in the game.
[255:29.96]Do it!
[255:32.13]Turn- I'm not gonna turn the bitrate down on the stream!
[255:39.66]No, let me just- wait!
[255:55.87]I think you seriously underestimated how much I cannot see what's going on on the screen.
[256:07.75]Nah, but if this is authentic though, I have to play a little differently, you know what I'm saying?
[256:21.67]Oh fucking Jesus, let me do this!
[256:30.10]Oh.
[256:30.64]My.
[256:31.46]God.
[256:33.04]Fuck this, I'm outta here.
[256:41.47]I have to use the actual controller.
[257:10.29]I don't have the controls.
[257:12.23]What are the controls?
[257:15.07]Oh.
[257:19.57]Use tilt controls.
[257:22.84]One of the crazy things about this is that I'm... What is that?
[257:26.20]Oh.
[257:26.30]I don't have any more bullets.
[257:37.25]Alright, I figured out how to use the...
[257:42.38]Okay, hold, hold what?
[257:44.58]I can't even see what that says.
[257:45.95]Left trigger?
[257:46.49]I don't know what that even says.
[257:49.23]Right trigger?
[257:54.83]How's the battery?
[257:56.03]Battery low.
[258:30.03]Really?
[258:30.47]Come on, I thought it was already keyed out.
[258:34.39]It already had the channel gone.
[258:35.99]Whatever.
[258:50.07]Keep it.
[258:50.78]No, it has to be authentic.
[258:52.30]Alright, I don't know how much longer I can take this before my eyes actually start to hurt.
[259:14.51]I can go back to the controls I know how to use.
[259:16.47]Here comes the end of the joke voice.
[259:26.48]I'll do something epic before though.
[259:32.90]I promise I'm gonna do something fucking epic.
[259:36.52]Re-chat.
[259:37.96]No, I... Another link.
[259:46.74]Chat's going too fast, I can't click it.
[259:49.45]What is this?
[259:50.07]Is this supposed to be in my office?
[259:56.43]Is this my office?

[263:59.89]It's really, really too dirty, I think.
[264:02.91]Is that too dirty?
[264:15.23]Capacity is at like 75%.
[264:21.47]That's like fucking puke, man.
[264:23.35]That is so dirty.
[264:24.11]Somebody just dropped it in the mud.
[264:25.17]And put a reflection of my face.
[264:31.12]Oh, for the love of God.
[264:32.50]All right, give me a second.

[264:59.79]No, it's- okay, this'll work.
[265:11.38]It needs to be pointed in the right spot.

[265:14.44]I need to be looking right down at it, though.
[265:17.37]Okay, hold on.
[265:21.25]I gotta add that as a source now.

[267:16.64]How's that?
[267:31.48]Better?
[267:31.72]Are we good?
[267:37.69]Even less?
[267:46.43]Okay.
[268:24.31]How do you think it got so dirty?
[269:06.04]Oh wait, we got hands now?
[269:12.29]But the stylus!
[269:13.45]My hand's not on the stylus!
[269:16.09]The hand's on the stylus!
[269:17.23]I don't have three hands!
[269:23.31]Okay, that was... One second.
[269:36.64]Alright, we got hands.
[270:04.25]God damn it.
[270:04.89]This is fucking so stupid.
[270:06.03]I love it.
[270:19.02]Whoops, whoops, whoops.
[270:21.10]This- I have so many images here.
[270:22.48]What even is this?
[270:27.46]Which one of these is the right one?
[270:28.75]Okay, hold on.
[270:30.81]I need to do this.
[270:31.33]That's so dirty.
[270:37.63]Is that really what we were using?
[270:42.64]That's disgusting.
[270:45.68]Okay, that's this one.
[270:47.16]Where is the dirt coming from?
[270:49.28]Right here, right?
[270:51.48]No, that's this one.
[270:52.50]There's the dirt.
[270:53.14]All right.
[270:55.55]So now I need me turned on as the mirror.
[271:01.73]And this has to be on too.
[271:07.07]So this has to both be up here.
[271:10.95]So where is, there we go.
[271:15.85]Where's this image?
[271:17.99]Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[271:25.71]Why is it doing this?
[271:27.62]This should be at the top.
[271:32.40]Oh, it's because it's keying it out.
[271:33.84]Hold on.
[271:34.92]Hold on.
[271:36.06]Less dirt?
[271:36.72]No, we need all the dirt we can get.
[271:41.58]So this one can go... It's because it's keying out the background, so hold on.
[271:44.94]What is this one?
[271:46.14]It's the fucking battery.
[271:47.60]No, I'm getting rid of that.
[271:50.74]Here's this.
[271:52.84]This is another one that can be removed.
[271:57.23]This is... I don't even know what the fuck is down here.
[272:01.87]We're almost close to perfect.
[272:07.38]Okay, here's the game.
[272:09.92]Why is the game not being captured anymore?
[272:11.60]Okay, there we go.
[272:14.05]Alright, nice and... nice and dirty.
[272:17.19]What is that dirt?
[272:22.69]There it is.
[272:25.29]Okay.
[272:28.59]How's that?
[272:35.76]It's off-center?
[272:37.84]I can fix that.
[272:46.52]So I need to go here and here.
[272:51.23]The game needs to go... Let's see what we got here.
[272:56.13]Okay.
[273:02.50]Now, what is down there, though?
[273:03.92]I need to fullscreen this.
[273:14.23]Am I, like, eyes deceiving me?
[273:16.17]No, okay, it's fine.
[273:23.16]Move the dirt.
[273:24.20]Move dirt.
[273:25.00]Move the dirt.
[273:26.82]No, dirt's good.
[273:28.24]No, we're good.
[273:28.68]That's it.
[273:29.30]We're ready to go.
[273:33.53]Okay, now I gotta make sure you can see my face.

[274:38.79]This is kinda cool looking though.
[274:41.41]Look out there, man.
[274:43.27]It actually looks really good on the 3DS.
[274:51.23]My hands!
[274:52.25]My hands are down here!
[275:04.20]Three hands.
[275:09.54]Alright, I'm gonna land on the bridge.
[275:12.76]I see a guy!
[275:17.51]Well, shit.
[275:20.05]I got to get out of here.
[275:20.65]I got to get out of here.
[275:25.03]I'm going to run a wingsuit.
[275:25.73]Wingsuit, man.
[275:27.43]Let's fly out of here.
[275:28.49]Epic style.
[275:31.45]Oh.
[275:33.11]That's all right.
[275:33.49]I'm still alive.
[275:39.57]I have bullets.
[275:46.92]Oopsie daisy.
[275:58.21]What is that on my screen?
[275:59.51]My screen's a little dirty.
[276:21.21]Well, am I supposed to go this way for the mission?
[276:35.37]Well guys, do you know, do you see where the mission is?
[276:37.44]I think I need to check my map.
[276:47.20]Down here?
[276:47.68]Two maps.
[276:57.05]This is two maps.
[277:09.54]Two!
[277:10.34]Two maps!
[277:11.84]Yeah, I really like the Super DS.
[277:13.06]It's got these great... It's a great feature.
[277:18.79]Four hands!
[277:19.61]Alright, I'm gonna find a plane, man.
[277:23.95]I'm gonna find a plane.
[277:24.71]I don't have any bullets left.
[277:45.05]There really is so much dirt on here.
[277:50.82]Clean my screen.
[277:51.62]Oh, hold on a minute.
[277:53.26]Hold on, let me clean.
[277:54.88]What's going on here?
[277:58.70]What?
[278:00.43]What's all over the screen?
[278:04.21]Hold on.
[278:16.13]I can't get it off.
[278:26.36]Somebody said the screen was fucked up.
[278:27.86]Is it better?
[278:29.54]I think it looks better.
[278:44.45]Whoops.
[278:48.86]Oh, I think, yeah, I think we're good.
[278:54.64]Hold on, I can't... Oops.
[279:02.09]What the fuck happened to this thing?
[279:03.59]I don't know, man, I was trying to... What happened?
[279:15.72]Oh, let me clean my screen.
[279:18.39]Yeah, all you guys saying my screen is dirty.
[279:20.82]There we go.
[279:23.80]ECH!
[279:27.84]Oh, sorry.
[279:32.99]Let me just... clean that up real quick.
[279:42.85]ECH!
[279:48.06]Oh, whoops.
[280:02.53]Alright, I'm fucking done.
[280:04.23]Like, I played Just Cause before.
[280:07.32]Sneezing cracks.
[280:11.36]I sneezed so badly that it cracked my 3DS.
[280:17.43]Really?
[280:17.85]Hold on.
[280:34.23]No, I can't like, I can't like punch it.
[280:36.73]And like, I guess I can.
[280:43.18]What the fuck man?
[280:52.24]I can't control it.
[280:53.46]Dude, this game sucks.
[280:55.04]This game sucks, okay?
[280:56.30]This game... Crack!
[281:07.65]3DS voice.
[281:25.68]Mom!
[281:33.35]Mom!
[281:42.93]Mom, do you know where my charger is?
[281:44.38]I'm at 1% battery!
[281:58.30]This game sucks!
[282:20.83]3D.
[282:21.59]Alright, I'm out.
[282:22.81]That was fun.
[282:23.55]I'm done with this.
[282:30.67]It's impossible, I can't play like this.
[282:43.05]My 3DS is off, my 3DS is broken now, sorry guys.
[282:50.50]It's a webcam mic?
[282:52.46]It shouldn't be.
[282:57.38]I brought my 3DS for you.
[282:58.02]I heard yours broke.
[282:59.34]I also brought the charger for you.
[283:01.20]Thanks, Mom.
[283:02.26]Son, take better care.
[283:05.13]Can I... Of your 3DS, please.
[283:06.51]I'm sorry.
[283:15.43]Broke my 3DS.
[283:29.26]Two 3DS's?
[283:31.05]Are you serious?
[283:41.25]What's in there?
[283:44.73]Oh my god, it's... Just Cause 4!
[284:01.44]There's like four 3DSs in this house.
[284:07.30]How do I go back to normal?
[284:09.13]Is it even possible?
[284:14.47]Fix the resolution so you can play, but please keep the 3DS overlay.
[284:18.21]Why do you want the 3DS overlay?
[284:21.19]It's impossible to watch.
[284:33.85]It's just a lie.
[284:35.17]It's not even real.
[284:38.33]Hold on.
[284:40.49]The dirt on the screen.
[284:41.77]Let me at least be able to see what I'm doing.
[284:53.15]Wait, we're on the webcam?
[284:56.01]Why are we on the webcam mic?
[284:59.99]That's not the webcam mic.
[285:02.82]Oh, you want to be on the webcam, Mike.
[285:05.04]I see what you're saying.
[285:06.84]I get it.
[285:25.94]Okay.
[285:27.92]I'm a secret agent!
[285:49.36]This game's actually really, really good, though.
[285:55.74]It's got mostly negative on Steam.
[285:59.02]I don't know.
[286:01.00]Maybe it's because it's not on 3DS, like this is.
[286:09.19]I mean, that's probably why.
[286:10.67]Because it's not on 3DS.
[286:27.83]And that's it.
[286:29.19]And that's it.
[286:36.33]The immersion is... We're done with this.
[286:39.18]That was a lot of fun.
[286:43.68]Now I'm going to go back to playing Just Cause 4.
[286:47.86]I mean, this has been like a fucking hour.
[286:51.87]We've been doing this for an hour.
[287:03.08]No, I'm not turning the stream off.
[287:09.69]Don't let the Photoshop go to waste.
[287:17.23]Some guy gave hands to you.
[287:19.91]Whose hands are those, though?
[287:21.29]I don't know whose those are.
[287:28.83]What happened?
[287:30.33]Why did that happen?
[287:34.17]They're yours.
[287:34.89]All right.
[287:41.60]I need to go back to normal.
[287:48.44]That was fucking, that was a lot of fun.
[287:51.59]But I need to put this back into 1080 before I literally lose my mind.
[288:03.23]So tomorrow, we're going to be streaming the Game Awards, if you didn't know.
[288:12.39]Should be fun.
[288:15.39]I'm not leaving.
[288:16.37]I'm not leaving.
[288:17.29]Why does everybody think I'm leaving?
[288:20.01]I can't say, well, okay, until people just think I'm going to leave the stream.
[288:26.56]Well, that doesn't look right.
[288:29.60]This looks completely wrong.
[288:32.50]Okay, well, let's try maybe this will fix it.
[288:36.01]Hey, look at that.
[288:38.97]Wow, this feels very strange.
[288:41.27]This feels incorrect.
[288:44.51]I really feel like this feels wrong.
[288:46.31]Okay.
[288:53.23]Yeah, Game Awards, I'm going to be streaming it.
[288:55.11]We're going to, oh, we're going to talk about it.
[288:56.61]All right, I'm going to give me this car.
[289:04.15]Actually, I want a bike.
[289:09.45]Well, I missed the bike like an idiot.
[289:14.74]Alright, how far away is that start?
[289:16.26]Agency Distri- What the fuck?
[289:22.64]Why is there a tank here?
[289:26.99]And why am I still alive?
[289:32.93]Who's playing a fucking RTS right now?
[289:39.08]Do they think that's me?
[289:39.90]That guy's still alive.
[289:45.55]He's still trying to drive the car.
[289:53.63]Okay.
[289:54.55]Well, not anymore, it seems.
[289:56.51]Oh my god, we're the psychos!
[290:07.72]Destroy the bridge.
[290:08.52]Okay, fine!
[290:09.10]Watch it!
[290:10.98]You can do that.
[290:11.94]You actually can... I thought you were kidding me.
[290:20.70]Okay, I've got to get down there.
[290:29.76]This way.
[290:32.20]How far away is this place?
[290:34.06]Actually, not that far.
[290:34.82]We can get there in a lickety-split.
[290:42.17]Alright, let me try not to... I said that and I almost did it.
[290:49.20]I'm so used to playing this on the 3DS that I forget how to control the game.
[291:09.93]No, we're pretty far away.
[291:11.13]I could get some speed here.
[291:15.23]There we go.
[291:15.77]I finally figured it out.
[291:22.07]Now I'm moving fast.
[291:22.97]NOW I'M MOVING FAST!
[291:28.73]YEAH!
[291:29.55]YEAH!
[291:29.71]YEAH!
[291:30.23]Very fast!
[291:30.61]Hooray!
[291:50.70]It's transitioning between the two of them that makes it easier, like that.
[292:09.39]Why is everybody making the I made this face?
[292:16.58]I love this stream.
[292:17.96]Why is I made this?
[292:23.19]Oh, for the love of God, okay.
[292:35.25]Well, that was, uh, okay.
[292:41.58]That looks a little better, right?
[292:43.78]Yeah?
[292:44.12]Okay, we're fine.
[292:45.14]Hey!
[292:45.70]Hi, I'm back!
[292:52.13]How long... Oh, that must have been on there the whole time.
[292:56.61]It's alright.
[292:57.83]Did I go by it?
[292:58.67]No, it's right here.
[293:02.47]Go back to the webcam.
[293:04.58]The webcam mic is not still on.
[293:19.64]I just want to get up to the top of the mountain.
[293:22.88]Oh, the game audio too, fuck.
[293:26.44]I forgot there's a shitload of filters on this, there's so many.
[293:29.38]The game, okay.
[293:31.66]Now you should, it shouldn't be insane.
[293:39.16]What a terrible fucking stream that would have been.
[293:41.94]Webcam mic and a bunch of filters on the audio.
[293:49.62]Stream is now ruined.
[293:56.42]Why would you do something like that?
[294:01.96]Thank God I didn't kick the goat in the head.
[294:03.46]Okay, we're gonna do a mission.
[294:06.26]Hey, would you look at that?
[294:09.97]Hey, look, a mission, guys.
[294:11.93]Can you believe it?
[294:19.87]Yep.
[294:26.65]It's all clear, Mita.
[294:27.95]I'm on my way.
[294:29.33]Who's that?
[294:31.91]Why are you here, Sheldon?
[294:33.85]when you went dark after medici I figured I'd look through some of your old files see where you might end up it turns out your dad was working with oscar he has a really really great something called project christmas beard what do you know about that's like tinsel talk of weather modification technology strategic
[294:59.47]Did I turn the graphics back, right?
[295:05.61]I guess I'm not the only one who doesn't trust Tom Sheldon.
[295:10.99]Maybe I didn't.
[295:11.59]I know you're looking to take out Iapa Rico.
[295:14.33]I've already done some of the legwork.
[295:15.61]That's fake snow.
[295:18.11]You screwed me over more than once in Medici.
[295:21.21]I don't want your help, Sheldon.
[295:22.88]Well, you're going to need it.
[295:23.88]Man, this looked much better on the 3DS.
[295:25.42]I agree.
[295:28.68]Turns out that place is constantly surrounded by a nasty lightning storm.
[295:34.08]Fried poor Annabelle here.
[295:35.36]That seems pretty suspicious to have a standing lightning storm like that, don't you think?
[295:45.47]Is this a friend of yours, Rico?
[295:47.91]Not exactly.
[295:48.57]Mira Morales, this is Tom Sheldon.
[295:52.19]I'm sorry about the mouse.
[295:53.07]Nothing I can do about it.
[295:54.47]He cannot be trusted.
[295:56.79]Buenas.
[295:57.86]Don't listen to this guy, senorita.
[296:00.31]Pleased to meet you.
[296:02.11]Rico and I were just discussing the situation with Zona Dos.
[296:05.43]I thought there was a mouse in my coffee for a second.
[296:09.15]It's an ice cube.
[296:09.99]I didn't want to freak the fuck out.
[296:12.85]Okay, this is very cool.
[296:14.44]I can't wait to understand the story.
[296:16.24]Alright, hold on.
[296:30.21]Is the water- is his beard made out of water?
[296:31.91]Does it look better?
[296:47.92]That looks kind of alright.
[296:58.23]Apply the 3DS settings.
[297:01.71]I need... I need Sasau.
[297:04.05]I don't think I... I don't need to turn on Sasau.
[297:13.27]Now do max settings.
[297:15.11]No, I don't like the way games look with max settings.
[297:18.15]They look overproduced.
[297:25.90]You know why a lot of your favorite first-person shooter streamers play on low settings?
[297:31.40]Because of all the lights and graphics and illuminations.
[297:34.45]No, it's easier to play a game and see when it's not on like maximum settings.
[297:46.95]Yes, it is.
[297:48.61]Type in professional Counter-Strike player low graphics and you tell me what you find.
[298:00.88]Come on!
[298:03.28]Damn it, I didn't get it.
[298:16.87]Yes, you need to type in... Professional Counter-Strike player graphics settings.
[298:27.54]Why did that guy do it like that?
[298:36.30]He's right.
[298:37.69]I know that people play on low graphics so they can see the game better.
[298:42.35]Just type in a computer.
[298:43.73]Professional Counter-Strike graphics commands.
[298:47.23]Professional CSGO player.
[298:54.78]Alright, what mission am I going to do before I turn off the stream?
[298:57.78]How about that one?
[299:01.74]No, just open up a Google search and type in a computer.
[299:04.34]Type in...
[299:07.39]What should I put my graphic settings on if I'm going to play professional Counter-Strike?
[299:11.85]What is a pro player's setup?
[299:14.25]Do they use low settings?
[299:15.67]How do you use turbo jump?
[299:22.24]Turbo jump.
[299:24.16]Oh.
[299:36.46]No, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[299:42.33]Did it bounce?
[299:43.95]No.
[299:44.91]It just turned to shit.
[299:45.75]Okay, whatever.
[299:46.81]Can you use my grenade launcher?
[299:51.14]Sick!
[299:52.50]Dude, thanks for the fucking heads up, man.

[301:18.97]Who the heck can spawn me right next to a bad guy?
[301:21.73]What the heck?
[301:24.56]Get out of here!
[301:26.00]You're gonna hit a bad guy?
[301:52.59]Let me look at the map.
[301:54.09]I want to do one more thing before I... Well, okay, so... You know what I mean?
[302:05.83]I want to do one more thing.

[319:41.16]Alright, where is it?
[319:42.83]Looking for the blimp.

[321:12.99]The car exploded!
[321:14.49]I can't believe it!
[321:21.31]My durability!
[321:28.24]Alright.
[321:29.06]That's the end of the stream.
[321:32.22]This game gets a... Whatever, you like it if you like it.
[321:37.17]And if you don't, then you just didn't like it.
[321:38.47]And you don't like it, then you buy it if you think it's fun.
[321:45.39]I don't know, maybe I'll play it again.
[321:51.64]I want the 3DS version.
[321:52.60]It's probably pretty good.
[321:56.98]So, tomorrow...
[321:59.29]What's gonna happen tomorrow is, if it is actually legal, then I'm gonna restream the Game Awards.
[322:05.19]I'm gonna watch the Game Awards together.
[322:06.67]And we're gonna watch Fortnite win every single category.
[322:23.26]It's legal?
[322:23.78]Alright.
[322:28.44]Game Awards are at 12 PST.
[322:30.91]Well, we're going to have to be ready for it then.
[322:36.01]But thanks for sticking around.
[322:37.63]Just wanted to check out Just Cause 4, which I've had fun.
[322:41.87]I had fun.
[322:42.28]It was a fun game.
[322:43.58]But a little on the weird side.
[322:48.40]Wait, 12?
[322:48.66]What do you mean?
[322:50.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[322:51.36]Hold on a second.
[322:51.90]Let me make sure we get this right before I get out of here.
[322:59.14]I don't think that's correct.
[323:00.08]12 PST?
[323:01.94]No, it's gotta be later than that.
[323:08.61]Game Awards.
[323:14.27]The Game Awards are... 530 PST.
[323:20.49]Okay.
[323:22.09]So, at 530 PST is when the stream's gonna be tomorrow.
[323:27.76]Yeah, we're just gonna have fun.
[323:29.98]There'll be a face cam there, you know?
[323:32.68]Maybe.
[323:33.60]If I feel like turning it on.
[323:41.33]But yeah, let's get to the bits.
[323:42.95]Let's put the outro on the screen.
[323:46.07]Thanks for sticking around.
[323:46.72]I hope you had a good time.
[323:48.72]I did.
[323:51.36]I did burp a few times on stream, but it's okay.
[323:56.12]And let's bring ourselves back to just under five and a half hours ago.
[324:04.59]We had three dollars from Divas.
[324:06.17]Thank you, Divas, for the three bucks.
[324:08.73]Most of the loss gave one dollar.
[324:10.80]The reason I was tilted earlier is because you always go live five minutes before I need to leave.
[324:14.40]Oh, I'm sorry.
[324:17.48]Sorry about that.
[324:22.70]You know, I'm sorry about that.
[324:26.54]That's the real end of the stream voice.
[324:28.02]Yeah, it is.
[324:31.98]But thank you, MostlyLost, for the $2 total here.
[324:34.50]Obviously, you need to operate on my schedule and you can't go live until I say so.
[324:40.21]It's very difficult.
[324:41.85]I will tell you.
[324:43.43]Especially being on Pacific time now.
[324:45.01]It's... When you're on PST, you have to remember that you're essentially back in time.
[324:52.06]Because noon Pacific...
[324:55.56]Or even like 10 a.m.
[324:56.98]Pacific.
[324:58.36]Is 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... It's like 6 or 7 o'clock EU.
[325:04.91]If I got up at like 9 in the morning and streamed at 9 in the morning, it'd be like 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[325:10.65]That's kind of insane.
[325:15.71]But... Sorry if time zones... Screw up your viewing habits.
[325:22.85]I'm sorry that it's like that.
[325:28.18]Sorry to hear about your Pacific time.
[325:34.14]What?
[325:35.22]Lorag, $100.
[325:36.26]Lorag, $98.
[325:37.18]$100 earlier.
[325:40.31]Thank you so much.
[325:41.27]SirFeline, $1.
[325:42.59]Shit, the ground is shaking.
[325:45.95]It was for a large portion of this stream.
[325:48.01]Thank you.
[325:48.35]BakeMeHome for the $1.
[325:50.11]MarvishMigali for the $1.
[325:52.41]Just an EU guy passing by.
[325:53.82]I hope you had a good time.
[325:54.60]Good night, JermaFireman.
[325:58.11]I think we got... I think we got fun out of this.
[326:01.33]Maybe we didn't get $60 worth of fun.
[326:03.41]I don't know.
[326:04.63]We got at least $17 worth of fun.
[326:08.97]If I keep playing it the next couple days, maybe I'll get $41 of fun.
[326:14.80]I'm not sure.
[326:21.64]$60 for a 3DS game.
[326:25.15]It's kind of getting ridiculous, isn't it?
[326:28.54]Uh, thank you Freddy C for the two bucks.
[326:30.28]They just say beautiful, thank you.
[326:32.42]Sly 161, thanks for the one dollar.
[326:34.10]Hey Jerma, I know chat didn't really like watching it, but Two Point Hospital got new DLC.
[326:38.72]Wanted to let you know because I know you enjoyed the game.
[326:42.37]I don't know what it was.
[326:43.93]What was with it?
[326:44.99]Okay, I turned on Two Point Hospital, and a lot of you guys were acting as if I was just blowing a fire alarm through your speakers.
[326:55.13]Like, I had to turn that off.
[326:57.10]It was a bullhorn next to a fire alarm.
[327:07.30]It was bad.
[327:07.92]I don't... Okay.
[327:11.06]I have like at least three times where I've looked over and been like, why is everybody so fucking angry?
[327:17.90]Octogeddon.
[327:19.82]Octogeddon stream two.
[327:22.15]was another one of those two-point hospitals where everyone was just hating everything.
[327:28.57]That's the only two that I can really actually think of where it was like, whoa!
[327:31.73]Everybody's very mad right now.
[327:43.08]Yeah, I did two Octogeddon streams.
[327:50.83]That's the only two times I think I could really pinpoint when I, it was just like, whoa, people are very angry with me.
[327:57.84]Nintendo Labo was like that too, but I was shit-faced, so I don't even know what you're talking about.
[328:08.56]But thank you, Sly.
[328:10.45]Uh, thank you, uh, Teidolf Swiftler.
[328:14.55]Thank you for the one dollar.
[328:15.73]Hey, Jerma, it's me.
[328:16.47]I know I'm asking a lot of you to do this, but I just spent the last of my grocery money on these bits.
[328:21.23]And I'm gonna starve to the winter if I don't hear you say the magic words.
[328:23.77]Please, please.
[328:25.73]Uh... What do you want me to do?
[328:30.81]Say the words, savory dog smell.
[328:35.19]I've said that like a hundred times.
[328:42.01]Thank you, Darkstar.
[328:43.16]700,000 games for the $1.
[328:44.08]Please, dear Christ, fix the graphics.
[328:46.42]This game looks absolutely gorgeous normally.
[328:48.26]I think your computer is fucked up.
[328:54.50]Is it- I- Really?
[328:57.52]Are you sure?
[329:03.04]No, this is not even at the 3DS bit.
[329:05.19]This is before that.
[329:07.99]I don't know.
[329:08.39]It looked okay, except for Christmas beard.
[329:15.84]It was a little janky and ugly.
[329:17.66]There was a lot of alicing.
[329:20.04]And it was very bright.
[329:25.08]Actually, it did look pretty bad.
[329:26.08]You're right.
[329:26.46]Never mind.
[329:28.49]But thank you, though.
[329:30.07]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for these $6.
[329:33.33]Germa Hart.
[329:34.15]That's all they say.
[329:34.79]Thanks a lot.
[329:35.21]Appreciate it.
[329:38.05]Hawkeye of Mine gave $4.99. $4.99.
[329:42.69]Watching you in an open world game is probably one of the most incredible things to watch.
[329:45.85]This game is your element.
[329:47.95]L-U-L.
[329:50.59]The game is still better looking than you.
[329:54.86]Ban that guy.
[329:55.74]Not only ban that guy for life, ban his other accounts too.
[330:01.74]Click on like, click on like, like post history and like find like, and then like ban everything.
[330:21.28]Don't you guys know that I know Dave Twitch?
[330:27.83]Actually, it's a short name.
[330:29.59]It's Dave.
[330:30.73]It's Dave Twitchonsky.
[330:35.70]He's a very close family friend.
[330:38.92]Easy.
[330:45.42]But thank you, Hawkeye.
[330:46.37]Thank you, I'm Pink, the $15, I'm Pink.
[330:50.15]15 bucks.
[330:51.53]I've watched you on YouTube for a while, but four years ago is when I started, though.
[330:54.89]I would say how much I love your content.
[330:59.47]Four years ago is when I started, though.
[331:02.48]It's a long time.
[331:05.18]Thank you for being here for this long.
[331:09.26]It's weird, because... The 10-year is going to be coming up here in a couple of years.
[331:15.85]Just over two and a half years, right?
[331:19.32]Once we hit 2020, that would be, because I started in 2011.
[331:23.48]So we're talking about only another two to three years before that's a full decade that I've been doing YouTube and Twitch.
[331:34.64]What am I going to do for the 10 year anniversary?
[331:36.08]I have no idea.
[331:41.04]Eat a jar of peanut butter.
[331:42.98]Off stream.
[331:44.72]And not stream that day.
[331:51.17]But thank you.
[331:51.99]I'm pink.
[331:54.25]DeadC4T, thank you for the $100.
[331:57.51]Thank you so much.
[331:58.33]Thank you.
[331:58.71]I'm pink again for your $100.
[332:06.18]Really appreciate that.
[332:06.96]That's a fucking lot of money.
[332:08.06]Thank you, guys.
[332:14.94]You guys are too generous.
[332:17.06]Thank you.
[332:18.84]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[332:19.96]I have to say that the other night is some of the most fun I've had on your stream.
[332:22.36]Not only watching, but just interacting.
[332:24.62]Nearly 12,000 viewers.
[332:26.95]I've never seen a better group of chatters on this site.
[332:28.79]I love being here.
[332:29.51]It's always a great experience.
[332:33.09]Yeah, that was wild.
[332:37.66]Never, never before have I ever had that many people here.
[332:41.57]The last Jerma wrestling thing was just about 10,000, and then that was about 12,000.
[332:45.51]Like, in the last week, I've never seen anything like that before.
[332:55.29]That's... That's fucking crazy.
[333:01.07]So if you were part of that, you participated, thank you.
[333:05.85]You're amazing.
[333:06.97]Thanks for fucking coming out here.

[333:20.63]Thank you.

[333:29.43]I don't think so.
[333:29.97]I don't think you guys are mean.
[333:34.89]What do you mean mean?

[337:49.28]After an explosion of subs.
[337:55.08]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $1.
[337:57.30]Hope you're doing alright.
[337:57.88]Just wanted to say the green screen movie night my entire rest of the year.
[338:00.84]It was great.
[338:01.80]I also hope we didn't ruin any chances of you wanting to watch JoJo.
[338:06.89]No, that's okay.
[338:10.39]I told you, 2019, the one anime is gonna be JoJo.
[338:13.85]I'm gonna watch season one.
[338:16.37]Only.
[338:18.13]Everyone wanted me to do that.
[338:19.03]They said, watch season one.
[338:20.37]Season one is what you should watch.
[338:21.69]I'm like, okay, fine, I'll watch season one.
[338:29.36]Uh, but thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the one dollar.
[338:32.22]Garfield thought of a strange scenario.
[338:33.82]If there was a week-long purge, who are two guys you would trust to protect you?
[338:40.24]you can pick fictional characters.
[338:42.23]They can't have any superpowers, so Batman would be allowed, but he can only use gadgets.
[338:48.99]Uh, they're not capable of turning against you, so if you hire the Joker, he can only protect you.
[338:55.65]Garfield would choose Mr. Rogers and Pooh Bear.
[339:00.16]Okay.
[339:02.28]Um... That's very easy.
[339:06.96]God.
[339:09.28]Wait, is God of Super... Hold on, wait, no, no, no, no.
[339:12.02]Um... What do I pick to protect me?
[339:20.91]You know, I would pick Garfield.
[339:23.15]I'd pick Garfield.
[339:25.39]And man, would we get ourselves in some real dangerous situations.
[339:34.01]You know I picked Garfield and like Garfield it's like a fucking a hundred people coming to get me get out there Yeah, go get them There's a hundred of them go get them You're gonna protect me
[340:04.13]And the second person I would pick, because Garfield would just be destroyed in a second.
[340:09.19]The second person would be... Someone that doesn't have superpowers.
[340:35.50]It would have to be somebody huge.
[340:37.60]That's really fast.
[340:39.22]That's really strong.
[340:41.40]Alright, can I pick, can I pick like the mountain from Game of Thrones?
[340:44.27]Does that mean that's like... Okay, so it would be Garfield and then the mountain.
[341:01.89]See, somebody would just shoot him.
[341:04.07]But this is a world with no guns, right?
[341:06.17]It's just who do you- whatever.
[341:08.26]That- okay, I would pick a guy that had a gun.
[341:11.86]And he was very good at it.
[341:15.42]I'd pick like 47 or something.
[341:20.92]A gun is not a superpower.
[341:26.98]Thank you, Garfield.
[341:27.70]Thank you, Captain Worgen for the one dollar.
[341:30.29]Thank you- listen to all these subs.
[341:33.72]Thank you, uh, G da... G da X. Thank you for the one dollar.
[341:41.88]Hey Germa, while you're stuck in the endless table surge, make sure to change your balloon height to infinity.
[341:47.21]It's what you paid for.
[341:50.25]We ended up going in and doing it, thankfully.
[341:54.11]Pigeon attack, thanks for the ten dollars pigeon attack.
[341:56.41]They say big plane.
[341:58.67]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[342:01.72]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[342:03.48]Big plane.
[342:04.37]Uh, I am Monk, thanks for the $1, God Gamer.
[342:08.17]I don't think so.
[342:10.41]Um... Okay, you could say, like, just a fun, intermediate level... ...intermediately skilled gamer.
[342:18.01]Okay?
[342:20.87]that beat Jevil first try, and beat Flamelurker first try, and hit all of the targets in Point Blank 2, which is nearly fucking 100% impossible.
[342:33.74]So, take that with what you will, I guess.
[342:45.97]Nearly and 100%.
[342:48.35]Thank you, uh, thank you Gnostic for the $10.
[342:52.12]Thank you so much.
[342:54.88]Hey German, it's my birthday today.

[343:13.95]And speaking of ten bucks, thank you, uh... Thank you, X-Chris, for the ten dollars.
[343:21.69]Thank you.
[343:24.05]Thank you for the ten dollars.
[343:27.53]Thank you also to... Smug.
[343:31.99]Smug Jund.
[343:33.79]For the one dollar.
[343:35.57]A joke truly worth two hundred people.
[343:41.32]Shut it off!
[343:42.60]Shut it off already!
[343:44.58]Like the sound, the sub sound.
[343:50.55]Does anybody else feel like it's broken?
[343:53.13]I think it might be broken.
[343:57.35]Is it just in a constant never-ending loop?
[344:01.91]It might be.
[344:03.26]Wait, hold on.
[344:12.13]Wait, okay, it was stuck.
[344:16.01]I think it actually was stuck.
[344:21.56]But, thank you, Smug, for the one dollar here.
[344:27.80]Mostly lost thanks to the one dollar again.
[344:29.18]What?
[344:29.42]I can't fly this thing.
[344:32.68]No, she couldn't.
[344:35.31]For God's sakes, man, shut it up.
[344:38.75]Well, we'll be streaming tomorrow too, man.
[344:39.99]We'll be live tomorrow as well.
[344:40.91]With our Game Awards stream commentary.
[345:06.70]Peter gave five community subs again, and MaxiKaspersky gave five again.
[345:12.49]Again.
[345:14.03]They did it another time.
[345:22.39]Five each again.
[345:23.59]Thank you, guys.
[345:26.86]And speaking of people that have been handing out community subs in the last 40, 30, 40 minutes of this stream, Tater gave another one.
[345:36.05]Another five community sub drop here.
[345:42.11]It is raining subscribers.
[345:45.80]From a handful of incredibly generous individuals.
[345:47.96]Thank you, guys.
[345:53.62]Thank you so much.
[345:58.11]You spend a lot of money on this stream.
[346:06.92]It means a lot.
[346:11.04]Local streamer gets lots of community subs.
[346:17.10]Yeah.
[346:20.51]I do not take it for granted.
[346:23.41]Hopefully you will see where a lot of this money goes.
[346:30.54]Because it's going pretty much right back in.
[346:33.21]So... Thank you.
[346:39.97]Uh, a dapper dog.
[346:44.81]By the way, uh, happy birthday.

[347:20.23]They say fail fish.
[347:21.15]I must have done something real stupid.
[347:30.36]There was a point there in the middle of that.
[347:32.60]Before the DS bit.
[347:36.98]Where... I think I've ran into the ground like seven times in a row.
[347:41.85]Thank you, Springfield, for the $2.50.
[347:43.11]Hey, Jerma, I've been wondering for my entire life what happened to the Gift of Flight video.
[347:48.15]It's my favorite video of all time, and it's gone, missing what gives.
[347:52.93]I've explained it a few times before, but there was a point where I was trying to clean up the channel of terrible 13 and 7 fucking Call of Duty Kill Confirmed videos that I just hated.
[348:05.41]I was like, I don't want this on the channel, and I went through and I was checking boxes, and I was like, wait, what's this?
[348:11.74]And some of them just got checked that I shouldn't have checked.
[348:15.64]There was a period where, I don't know, man, like, I got to a point where...
[348:19.33]There was so many, like, videos that I wanted the channel to be more focused, and I was, like, embarrassed that people could go back and watch some of those terrible fucking videos where I literally just played Call of Duty for, like, eight minutes and uploaded whatever fucking happened.
[348:35.17]And I only did that, like, five times, so ten times maybe total of the nearly thousand videos that I uploaded on that channel.
[348:42.80]So, you know, I mean, I was starting to get a little bit more viewership.
[348:48.14]I was making content that I like to make more than something like that.
[348:51.81]And people were going to go back in the beginning of the channel and, oh, no, here's like, what are these videos?
[348:56.33]I'm going to watch these and be like, well, never mind.
[348:58.32]Let me unsubscribe this guy.
[348:59.42]I don't like this.
[349:08.70]So, if we get caught in the crossfires of me trying to clean the channel up of, like, stuff that I thought was bad.
[349:16.39]Bad as in, like, not good to watch.
[349:21.09]But, sorry that some of those videos were removed.
[349:27.75]But, thank you, Springfield, for the 250.
[349:30.56]Hopefully that is an explanation that you will be okay with.
[349:36.99]Hey, Kyra Toby, thanks for the $10.
[349:41.24]Thank you so much, Kyra Toby.
[349:44.68]Chat can thank Snowy on Discord for the edit.
[349:47.50]Here's a fixed version.
[349:52.77]Oh, for the 3DS.
[349:56.01]Yeah, thank you all of you guys that threw together in less than five minutes.
[350:02.59]Photoshopped hands and screen-skewing.
[350:06.15]That was a lot of fun.
[350:06.94]Thank you.
[350:09.94]Uh, Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[350:11.44]Play GeoGuessr.
[350:13.74]Not tonight.
[350:14.74]Not tonight.
[350:16.16]Uh, ThankYouPudding for the $1 3DS joke fund.
[350:19.71]Thank you.
[350:20.53]I'll put it in my 3DS joke fund.
[350:23.57]SaviorOfTheDreamingDead, thanks for the $1.
[350:25.99]How exactly did we get here?
[350:29.00]I turned the graphics down all the way in Just Cause and it looked like Nintendo 64 or 3DS.
[350:36.81]So then it was like, this is a 3DS game.
[350:39.17]Oh, okay.
[350:39.61]Hold on a second.
[350:40.23]And then it just spiraled out of control.
[350:43.43]That's what happened.
[350:44.57]It's kind of how it went down.
[350:49.03]Carrot!
[350:49.51]Thank you, Carrot, for the $1, the fucking 3DS.
[350:52.39]I can't even type.
[350:53.85]I'm laughing too hard.
[350:57.97]Glad you thought it was funny.
[350:59.41]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[351:02.05]Hey, Shootman!
[351:02.87]Thank you, Shootman, for the $1.
[351:03.93]I feel the need to admit that I watched the green screen movie night for an hour before realizing I'd already seen it.
[351:09.24]And it wasn't live.
[351:10.88]Thanks for the free content, you smooth brain stallion.
[351:15.56]What?
[351:26.38]Thank you?
[351:28.79]Thank you to MostlyLost for the $1.
[351:33.85]You're the top Just Cause 4 streamer on Twitch by a large margin.
[351:38.45]Doesn't... I mean, that doesn't really surprise me because I'm playing it like three days late.
[351:44.03]You know what I mean?
[351:46.27]Didn't this come out like on Monday or something?
[351:49.15]So, anyone that was gonna stream it... Anyone that was gonna stream it probably already did it, right?
[352:01.18]It came out yesterday.
[352:02.20]Oh, well.
[352:06.72]Three days yesterday ago.
[352:12.66]Whatever.
[352:17.33]No, that's cool.
[352:18.99]That's really, really... I mean, that's a... I don't really know what to say.
[352:26.69]You know, being in the top position in any given game is...
[352:31.50]This is an honor, right?
[352:32.82]Because it's like, oh, whoa, okay.
[352:36.14]That's really cool.
[352:38.00]Hopefully people like the stream.
[352:43.49]Top 3DS streamer.
[352:45.41]Hmm, maybe.
[352:47.99]Thank you.
[352:48.29]Mostly lost for the $1.
[352:49.09]You're the top.
[352:49.91]Whoa, whoa, I already did that.
[352:51.21]Just did it.
[352:51.91]Just did it.
[352:53.54]Thank you, MeatyMate, for the five dollars.
[352:56.52]MeatyMatey.
[352:58.22]Five bucks here.
[352:58.78]Thank you so much.
[353:00.28]BlueComet, thanks for the ten dollars.
[353:01.98]No message.
[353:03.63]Just ten bucks.
[353:04.27]Thanks a lot, dude.
[353:06.83]Ten bucks.
[353:08.09]Thank you.
[353:12.95]Pre-recorded stream.
[353:14.21]Skip.
[353:14.51]What?
[353:16.34]Uh, DanDaDump, thanks for the one dollar, just spent money to tell you this is the dumbest joke I think you've ever done.
[353:21.66]Keep up the good work.
[353:23.10]Just you fucking wait.
[353:26.12]Just wait.
[353:28.26]I would just wait before you say that.
[353:34.69]Okay.
[353:36.13]That's all I need to say.
[353:39.63]But, I thought it was really fun.
[353:43.14]Uh, Rin, thank you, Rin, for the five dollars.
[353:45.80]They just say PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp.
[353:49.10]Thank you.
[353:54.76]Uh, thank you, There, or ThereNor, ThereNor, for the one dollar.
[354:00.55]Top3DSGamer.
[354:05.11]Can you- I remember a long time ago I wanted to capture the 3DS, and it was... nearly impossible.
[354:11.99]You have- don't you have to get a separate device from a third party... that lets you hook into the- hooks into the back of the 3DS and lets you plug it into HDMI or something?
[354:25.37]You have to actually mod your 3DS.
[354:27.11]Hmm.
[354:32.60]I don't think there's anything I really would want to stream on 3DS anyways.
[354:35.55]Maybe the WarioWare game.
[354:37.99]But, we already played all the WarioWares a long time ago.
[354:42.35]That's probably, that's really the only thing I'd want to play.
[354:46.01]Just use the webcam.
[354:48.72]Go back to like 2007 YouTube.
[354:51.72]Hey, Dan with Wings, thanks for the $10, Dan.
[354:56.02]Thank you.
[354:56.28]I hope you still think that in another week, another day, another month, another year.
[354:58.42]Hope you still have fun.
[355:22.04]Thank you.
[355:22.54]Thank you, Smacklesmore, for the $1.
[355:23.72]Jeremy, you're the funniest and most creative streamer and also very handsome.
[355:28.96]I mean, those are like three.
[355:31.62]Three, like, super nice adjectives.
[355:34.09]You know what I mean?
[355:39.31]All I can say is thank you.
[355:42.21]Appreciate it.
[355:43.79]Kyra Topey, thanks for the $1 from Snowy again in the Discord in case the joke ever comes back.
[355:54.20]You know, it's just like a blank slate.
[355:56.60]That's so funny.
[355:59.18]I'm gonna have to hold on to this because if in case that ever comes back, I have a perfect image.
[356:03.80]Thank you.
[356:07.50]Mr. Wink, thanks for the $1.50.
[356:09.12]They just say, hoo-hoo.
[356:12.34]I think that's like the 0.2 second gnome video, right?
[356:17.50]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.00.
[356:18.74]If you went back and looked at all my bit messages, they probably amount to abuse.
[356:22.91]What?
[356:25.17]No.
[356:27.11]You're fine.
[356:27.47]Don't worry.
[356:32.51]Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[356:33.89]Smash comes out this week.
[356:35.01]Any plans on that?
[356:37.37]Um, I think so.
[356:39.39]But I don't want to turn on Smash on launch day.
[356:43.02]Because I'd like to unlock the characters and at least get familiar with it before I try to do anything with it.
[356:51.62]But...
[356:53.62]We'll see.
[356:54.96]There is a possibility that you will see Smash Bros.
[357:00.72]on the channel.
[357:01.66]Maybe.
[357:03.69]Uh, stream to story mode.
[357:04.77]I don't know if that would be very- I don't know if that's that interesting, though.
[357:08.71]It's just kind of fighting against bots.
[357:13.13]I'd rather get familiar and then do an actual multiplayer stream where I fucking decimate everybody as Pac-Man.
[357:29.45]We'll see.
[357:31.19]But yeah, that is exciting.
[357:32.17]It does come out soon.
[357:34.63]Thank you, though.
[357:36.07]Maxie Kaspersky, thanks for the $1.
[357:38.45]I'm something of a community sub myself.
[357:41.49]They sure have given a lot, so.
[357:43.36]Thank you.
[357:44.82]JerkTC gave $15.
[357:47.34]$15 from JerkTC.
[357:48.42]I'm here cuddling a kitten and having goosebumps because I like your videos so much.
[357:55.78]I'm a huge fan of goosebumps, too.
[357:58.58]I especially love the Abominable Snowman one.
[358:01.98]I love the Attack of the Dummy in the Attic, whatever that one's called.
[358:11.83]But in all seriousness, thank you.
[358:16.53]I'm very happy that you think that this is worth watching.
[358:22.78]I hope I can continue to have you feel that way.
[358:25.76]Thank you.
[358:26.48]For the $15.
[358:28.18]Thank you, Timmy, Tim Tam, for the $1.
[358:31.42]I didn't show up to the date.
[358:33.62]A date.
[358:35.27]Two.
[358:42.67]Hello?
[358:43.67]Sandy?
[358:44.55]Is that you?
[358:45.35]Yes, uh-huh.
[358:46.39]Who's this?
[358:47.27]It's Gil.
[358:48.03]Gil?
[358:48.69]Gil who?
[358:49.76]What do you mean, Gil who?
[358:51.40]Gil Dixon, of course.
[358:52.92]Oh, Gil Dixon.
[358:54.22]I'm sorry.
[358:55.38]Yes, we had a date last night.
[358:57.52]Where were you?
[358:58.56]I waited for one hour.
[359:00.08]Oh, I'm sorry, Gil.
[359:03.54]I couldn't come.
[359:05.60]Couldn't come?
[359:07.81]Why not?
[359:09.53]Well, I had to pack my stuff for my trip.
[359:14.70]Why didn't you call me?
[359:17.60]I wanted to call you, but I couldn't remember your phone number.
[359:25.46]My trip.
[359:26.62]And now I'm going to forget yours.
[359:29.08]A date.
[359:39.28]What do you mean, Gil who?
[359:41.38]Gil Dixon.
[359:42.10]Gil Dixon, of course.
[359:45.24]For one hour.
[359:46.68]I waited for one hour.
[359:50.95]I just lost yours.
[359:57.19]If you want to learn English, go check it out.
[360:04.05]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim.
[360:05.07]Thank you, UpQuark, for the $1.
[360:06.73]If you had to bring back one old meme, what would you bring back?
[360:11.24]um none of them I don't think no I'd rather I'd rather see and do new stuff you know we can always remember the old ones but there's new ones to make understand
[360:38.31]All your base art belong to us.
[360:40.09]No, I don't mean like in history.
[360:48.04]Thank you, though.
[360:49.16]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[360:50.42]Hey, Jerm, I was wondering if you plan on doing another movie night.
[360:52.98]I had a lot of fun making my Weather Channel video, and I hope I have a couple more ideas.
[360:58.75]I don't really have a plan to do a second one.
[361:04.08]But I might.
[361:06.54]There's a possibility where we could figure out something fun where you have to make something very specific.
[361:12.90]You know what I mean?
[361:14.74]So instead of just literally anything, there's maybe like a few different categories you could put it into.
[361:22.67]But I don't know.
[361:23.13]I don't really have a plan for it.
[361:30.59]Certain categories, maybe.
[361:34.33]But I'm very, very happy with what happened and how it turned out.
[361:37.31]And I've seen a lot of people discussing it.
[361:42.02]And I've seen all the people had a lot of fun.
[361:45.08]I'm really happy about that.
[361:46.08]I've also seen a little bit of criticism, and I can understand that.
[361:49.70]It was very, very difficult to... Because this was never supposed to be a contest, right?
[361:58.37]I wanted to try to include as many people as possible.
[362:05.56]Because... If, okay, let's say, for instance, okay, uh... Oh, there was like seven or eight JoJo videos, right?
[362:13.60]That's... Okay, yeah, that's... It's a lot.
[362:16.09]I think there's actually 15.
[362:16.81]But...
[362:20.84]People spent a lot of time on them, and I didn't want to have it, because at that point, it's, okay, all these submissions, I've got to get rid of all these, and only one of these videos can make it in, you know what I mean?
[362:32.97]At that point, it becomes a contest, rather than just like a night of just putting up as much as we possibly can, which is, that was the purpose of this last Sunday, you know?
[362:45.84]I didn't want to really exclude very many submissions.
[362:48.62]It was hard to exclude a bunch of them, but some of them really couldn't be used for various reasons.
[363:03.40]But it was more of a community night than like a video contest.
[363:07.79]There is plenty of potential to do a video contest.
[363:15.37]We'll see.
[363:24.95]But I had a lot of fun.
[363:26.57]And I said this on the stream before... at the end and at the beginning and midway through.
[363:32.15]I was absolutely blown away by how... just how fucking creative... so many of you guys are.
[363:38.99]So... I loved every second of it.
[363:45.63]Thank you Asha for the $5, Asha108.
[363:48.37]You're still the number one PUBG streamer on iPad.
[363:54.05]And I will keep my number one chicken dinner slot.
[364:00.29]As the number one mobile iPad PUBG streamer.
[364:04.95]Thank you, though, for the $5.
[364:05.85]Thank you, Aerolist, for the $1.
[364:06.81]DermaEarth, thank you.
[364:09.10]HoneyChain, thanks for the $1.
[364:09.98]Thank you for all the great videos and streams over the years.
[364:14.26]Thank you for watching the videos and the streams.
[364:18.02]HoneyChain, thank you.
[364:19.74]And then finally, DubskiDudeForOneDollar, when you were in that pit with the boulder and those random animals spawned, that was very eerily similar to your old Space Master video.
[364:29.40]It kind of freaked me out.
[364:31.20]All you new people need to look that video up.
[364:32.94]You can find it on an ancient website called YouTube.com.
[364:41.23]Animals.
[364:44.76]I just remember the bird flying upside down and around the circle.
[364:49.28]It was like a parakeet or something.
[364:55.41]And then the... What a weird fucking game.
[365:05.89]That is it for the bits.
[365:07.78]Let's show the sub-credits while we make our way out of here.
[365:13.42]Let's put them up on the screen, what do you say?
[365:18.59]Here they come.
[365:21.69]I get a feeling there's gonna be a lot of these.
[365:23.57]Considering the amount of gifted subs that were tonight.
[365:27.33]Oh yeah.
[365:30.99]Holy shit.
[365:32.47]That's going fast.
[365:39.74]That type of video is why you started watching in the first place?
[365:45.23]I mean, I always tried... I don't know, I get bored really easily, guys.
[365:51.35]I know that a lot of people ask, oh, what's your process when you go to make a video or a stream?
[365:57.46]It's pretty, it's very easy.
[365:58.90]I get very bored.
[366:01.00]And I like to try to do new things every time, or play something different, or try a different video, or try a different idea.
[366:07.49]Because if I do the same thing for too long, it'll bore me, I just get bored.
[366:21.84]Ever put something that you know is fun off?
[366:26.47]Um... You mean like I was having a good time and I know I was having fun but I turned it off?
[366:35.97]I don't think so.
[366:36.85]Maybe, um... Like Red Dead 2?
[366:40.99]No.
[366:53.85]Wait, what the hell does this explain, this image?
[366:56.92]It's four feet tall.
[366:59.78]44... 54 inches.
[367:02.88]What are you talking about?
[367:03.92]You don't know how tall the ceilings in my room are?
[367:11.60]You don't know how tall my ceilings are?
[367:13.18]I'm not 54 inches tall.
[367:19.08]I'm like 68 or something.
[367:23.96]Don't make me get a stick and stand next to it.
[367:29.14]Hold on a second here.
[367:36.46]I-I'm like 65, no no no, 68 or 69 inches tall.
[367:37.98]Yeah, I'm 69 inches tall.
[367:54.49]Look at all these subs.
[367:57.11]That's so many.
[367:59.09]That's so many in one day.
[368:06.63]That's the funny number.
[368:09.50]That's fine.
[368:12.58]Just because it's the funny number doesn't mean it's the real one.
[368:19.46]Four and a half feet tall.
[368:23.20]I'm gonna let you guys have this one, okay?
[368:26.53]Sure.
[368:34.93]Oh, Bob Champ!
[368:36.31]We can have it!
[368:40.37]Don't let them have it.
[368:44.00]Alright, guys.
[368:45.66]I'll see you tomorrow for the Game Awards.
[368:48.54]It should be fun.
[368:54.35]Right at the very end, we had Garfield the Monday Killer with a dollar.
[368:58.49]Garfield coming into the last second with one question.
[369:02.17]Um...
[369:19.13]I told, I talked about this once, maybe a little bit more, but I, I want every, since moving to Las Vegas, the whole point of coming out here was to try to dial it up, to try to do more, to every 30 to 45 days have something else going on.
[369:38.79]That was one of the number one reasons for being here.
[369:41.25]You know what I mean?
[369:45.48]So a green screen, it doesn't need to be a green screen.
[369:48.20]I have plans to do all kinds of shit.
[369:53.20]And the next thing that I plan on doing is probably going to be on Christmas Eve.
[369:57.97]I have a plan to do something on Christmas Eve.
[370:04.33]So if you have been enjoying the last couple of weeks of the green screen stuff, and then the German wrestling, I'm trying to try, I want to dial it up to like 11, man.
[370:21.81]Start expecting that once a month.
[370:30.02]11 out of 2.
[370:30.66]Oh yeah, here it comes!
[370:33.60]Turn it up!
