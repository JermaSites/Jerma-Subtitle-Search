[00:03.62]Howdy doody.
[00:05.76]Oh, how diddly-do, neighbor, right?
[00:12.53]What's that guy's name?
[00:13.71]Flanders?
[00:14.05]We're gonna play more Blitz the League 2 today.
[00:24.87]Because I think it's a great game.
[00:26.33]It's a lot of fun.
[00:30.42]Can I build another birdhouse?
[00:33.03]No, I think one is enough.
[00:35.73]I think one birdhouse is a pretty good quota for ten years.
[00:42.05]Last time I built a birdhouse, I was probably... No, I mean, I would say every time I get a tetanus shot is when a birdhouse should be built.
[00:54.76]So, you know.
[01:04.07]Go get a tetanus shot.
[01:05.01]Now, you know what?
[01:05.49]I actually think I'll probably do for one.
[01:12.14]Oh, my.
[01:12.52]What's going on with the sub notifications?
[01:16.32]Oh, wait.
[01:16.70]I heard about this.
[01:17.54]I heard about this.
[01:19.41]Yeah, I might have to turn off Streamlabs.
[01:23.15]I heard that it's broken, right?
[01:32.36]The stream the stream labs It's intended Oh Oh my god, okay, well That's like that's that's more resubs than chat Welcome to the stream
[02:01.70]But yeah, we're gonna play more Blitz the League.
[02:04.41]And I have something very unfortunate to tell you guys.
[02:07.93]No one's gonna want to hear this, but I have to say it.
[02:12.14]Unfortunately, this is one of those weeks where I have a lot of shit to do.
[02:19.46]The last couple days I've been doing things.
[02:23.33]I've been taking care of some stuff.
[02:25.63]And I gotta do my taxes.
[02:28.65]I gotta get it done.
[02:30.25]So this is pretty much the only stream until like probably Friday or Saturday.
[02:39.61]Because I gotta get that shit taken care of.
[02:42.05]So this is like the week that was gonna be kind of hard for me to stream that much.
[02:51.85]So, we'll go for, I'm gonna try to go as long as I can tonight.
[02:57.00]Just commit tax fraud.
[03:01.24]No.
[03:01.62]I gotta make sure I get it right.
[03:02.64]Every year I take at least a day or two.
[03:05.56]And it happened to fall.
[03:06.78]I talked to my CPA and there's a lot of shit that I gotta do and take care of because I moved and it's very confusing for me because I live in a different state and I have to file like twice or something.
[03:20.06]I don't know.
[03:20.40]It's a lot of random shit that I haven't ever had to deal with before.
[03:24.29]So I need to give the time necessary to get it right.
[03:27.67]So, um...
[03:29.83]You'll see me again.
[03:30.63]No, the stream's not like over.
[03:32.67]What am I doing?
[03:33.11]Oh, you'll see me again?
[03:33.95]Hey, I'll see you right now.
[03:36.64]This is the play, here we go.
[03:37.44]Alright, so I got the ball.
[03:40.30]Oh, almost interception.
[03:47.00]Just don't pay your taxes.
[03:49.07]That's not how it works.
[03:52.69]Just don't pay.
[03:56.17]That is such bad advice.
[04:04.54]Alright, we're going to play Blitz League 2, but I want to make sure... There's only been one stream this week.
[04:09.93]And I just want to make sure people are prepared for it.
[04:13.41]Fucking responsibilities.
[04:16.79]You know, being 33... Why can't I... I want to be, like, 12 again.
[04:21.99]I didn't have to do taxes when I was 12.
[04:23.41]I didn't have to, like, take care... I didn't have to have, like, a repairman... No, I... When I was 12, I just was 12.
[04:35.78]When I was 12, I wanted to be 33.
[04:37.20]That's weird how that works.
[04:43.13]12 hour stream for a 12 year old streamer.
[04:46.59]Alright, did I actually miss the window to press this again?
[04:54.64]But, yeah.
[04:56.80]I gotta be a good boy and get all my taxes done.
[05:03.94]And I was trying to find a place to do it and it's always like doing your taxes, especially somebody that gets the kind of income that I get.
[05:14.93]It's called 1099 for those of you that are just curious.
[05:19.07]I have to do them all myself with the help of obviously like a CPA.
[05:24.25]So it's always like, alright, I'm gonna do my taxes.
[05:28.81]I don't wanna, like I'll do it another day.
[05:32.08]And then, like, another, like, month goes by.
[05:33.64]No, but I, but, I, I still got time.
[05:35.66]I can do it, like, uh, next month.
[05:37.76]No, you gotta get done.
[05:38.88]So, I have to pick the day that I lock myself in my room for, like, at least a day or two.
[05:45.02]And that's tomorrow.
[05:50.90]Uh, so, we're gonna pick up, this is the, uh, unfortunately, this joke is, doesn't really mean anything anymore.
[05:58.31]Because we're Mr. Super Bowl and playing as the Las Vegas Super Bowlers.
[06:08.16]So that's kind of, uh... It's not going to really be... That's not funny anymore.
[06:19.52]I can't edit this team's name either.
[06:21.12]We can't go in and be like, oh, you know what?
[06:22.42]I want to change it to, like, the Las Vegas Dealers.
[06:24.19]That's what it should have been.
[06:27.67]But I listened to the one guy twice for the name of the character and the name of the team.
[06:37.36]Your mama's so stupid she brought cereal to the Super Bowl.
[06:41.08]Get that guy out of here.
[06:43.12]Talk about my mother like that?
[06:44.52]Get him out of here.
[06:47.50]Alright, so this is Division 2.
[06:49.60]We just leveled up.
[06:50.54]We just won the Division 3 championship.
[06:56.06]Anything we need to do?
[06:57.26]Somebody's injured.
[06:57.94]Isn't one of our good players injured?
[07:01.18]Yeah, halfback D. Sullivan is out for one more game.
[07:05.28]Unfortunately, we don't have a good halfback, so...
[07:07.93]That's just the way it is.
[07:08.59]How much money do I have?
[07:09.25]$17,000.
[07:09.27]We're 1-0 in Division 2.
[07:16.27]I don't understand how American football is played.
[07:18.09]Kiwo, you don't have to.
[07:20.37]This game, take away everything you know about sports.
[07:24.61]This has just hurt each other, the game.
[07:28.37]Okay, can you hurt somebody else?
[07:31.59]If the answer is, like, could you, like, punch a guy in the face?
[07:35.22]You could play this game.
[07:37.42]But hi, Kiwo.
[07:37.88]How you doing?
[07:42.52]Here comes another beer chug.
[07:44.20]Oh yeah, you're gonna see it like five times.
[07:45.96]Alright, we're gonna get our ass kicked here, because... No, always the best teams are always the ones that I beat without a problem at all.
[07:57.71]Drunk streamer?
[08:00.21]What?
[08:00.43]1-0 versus the Crossfire.
[08:06.69]Uh, every time I don't make a bet either.
[08:08.36]You know what, let's go all in.
[08:09.88]Fuck it, I need to win by 19 points.
[08:11.04]Let's go.
[08:12.74]Okay, so provoke him.
[08:37.76]So instead of provoking we need to get rid of Why is he like it why is he like an animal what Was that a lion How on Earth did this get a sequel because it's the best game ever I
[09:07.31]I'm actually sad that there's not a third one.
[09:15.95]It's the Las Vegas Cravesicles!
[09:21.75]So, those of you that weren't here in the last stream, you're probably wondering, he's playing a football game.
[09:27.76]Oh, how cool is that?
[09:28.78]Well, you're about to find out why that is.
[09:30.38]No, you're not.
[09:31.16]You're not.
[09:33.86]You will eventually.
[09:34.68]You'll find out.
[09:38.75]Why do you have monsters ink colors?
[09:41.32]Because that's my favorite movie ever made.
[09:42.88]Alright, I am the safety.
[09:46.08]This is my main character here.
[09:47.72]The character that is the character in the campaign.
[09:53.55]Oh, I didn't get him!
[09:57.33]And this is why we play this game, guys.
[09:58.91]You're about to find out.
[10:03.13]It's just a strain.
[10:04.06]It's just a neck strain.
[10:06.31]Holy shit, he got his bow out.
[10:08.19]Yeah, he's a sprained neck.
[10:09.53]We gotta get him out of here.
[10:11.51]I'll call the cart.
[10:12.25]Good.
[10:13.59]How long is he out for?
[10:15.17]Yeah, get the cart out here.
[10:20.59]That wasn't their star player, was it?
[10:22.63]I don't think it was.
[10:26.43]Four plays, that's not bad.
[10:27.93]Alright, I gotta stay back.
[10:32.83]No first down.
[10:33.41]Don't throw up over there!
[10:34.17]What are you doing?
[10:34.67]What's wrong with you?
[10:42.34]So in the top left and top right you can see a meter.
[10:45.46]And depending on how much meter you have, you can do certain things.
[10:49.66]So when you get a full meter and it says unleashed, is when you can really hurt somebody on these.
[10:54.97]We're talking like broken neck, we're talking snapping their collarbone off, we're talking like awful shit.
[11:02.91]They didn't get a first down?
[11:03.89]Holy shit, how?
[11:11.09]Always okay.
[11:11.67]I got okay.
[11:12.47]We're first fourth down the fourth down right now in inches We're gonna go with like a field goals walk No, no, no, no like this.
[11:21.99]Oh fuck.
[11:22.75]What are they doing?
[11:23.36]They're punting shit.
[11:24.38]Why?
[11:25.96]You inches you have to just walk not even alright.
[11:29.10]Come on Raymer Watch this shit
[11:41.01]Oh, no.
[11:44.85]Who was it?
[11:45.43]Was that me?
[11:48.29]Oh, it's just a sprained knee.
[11:50.73]It's alright.
[11:51.63]I got it.
[11:53.43]Don't worry.
[11:55.42]Sprained knee.
[11:57.52]More like you are not going to walk again.
[12:00.46]Holy shit.
[12:03.24]We haven't seen that one.
[12:06.94]How is that a sprain?
[12:09.64]OK.
[12:11.40]That guy, was that guy like an important player?
[12:12.88]I don't think he was.
[12:13.92]Nobody's here!
[12:20.28]Nobody's here!
[12:23.75]Stop him!
[12:24.17]Stop him!
[12:26.87]That is such a huge gain.
[12:30.25]We've just got so many yards.
[12:34.29]No, and there's also like these weird cheerleaders.
[12:36.51]That do the same animation every time.
[12:42.92]Somebody cut, cut!
[12:43.60]God damn it.
[12:44.36]That's such horse shit.
[12:47.56]How?
[12:47.78]I should have just punched him.
[12:51.16]It's alright, you got a long way to go.
[13:10.54]It's not gonna happen.
[13:12.04]Take his helmet off.
[13:12.72]Beat it, beat it.
[13:13.42]Go, go, go, go.
[13:19.16]Chad is now in re- oh yeah, that's right.
[13:20.78]Like, don't- should- I think I- do I have to turn this off?
[13:22.94]I think I have to turn off the reset, right?
[13:27.78]Do I?
[13:32.96]Get it!
[13:36.06]How do you not pick up that fumble?
[13:41.39]Why would I do that?
[13:43.61]I don't know if it was a thing that I should do.
[13:47.73]I don't know.
[13:48.23]I won't turn it off.
[13:49.69]I don't know how you catch that ball.
[13:55.92]That went through four people.
[13:57.78]Those guys have made it a fucking... How did that happen?
[14:09.93]I need to see that again.
[14:11.41]So I've got one, two, three, four defenders.
[14:13.49]I sack him.
[14:14.72]He gets the ball out.
[14:16.78]And I ghost through this guy.
[14:19.52]Three people can't stop him from catching that.
[14:23.60]That's what we call in the fucking... Hey, that's what we call in this industry.
[14:25.94]Baloney.
[14:27.70]Well, it's still fourth down.
[14:28.91]Sorry.
[14:40.32]This is the one, watch this.
[14:41.38]Alright, now I can't fuck this up.
[14:47.49]Why?
[14:53.35]What the hell?
[14:53.99]Didn't we give them hand lotion last time?
[15:01.46]I thought I upgraded their hands.
[15:03.34]Why am I fumbling every single time?
[15:10.20]Thankfully, they haven't scored any points.
[15:12.14]There we go.
[15:16.18]That's what I'm talking about.
[15:19.25]Alright.
[15:20.73]It's like it never happened.
[15:22.83]It never should have happened in the first place.
[15:28.31]What?
[15:28.55]Alright, let's go for a run.
[15:34.26]No, I don't want to unleash yet.
[15:36.38]Not unless I need to.
[15:39.11]Alright, I'm afraid to do like a QB sneak here.
[15:41.07]We're going to go with a pass.
[15:41.81]Alright, I need to get a... Come on!
[15:43.17]Speed!
[15:43.33]I'm unleashing here.
[16:07.63]How do you stop an unleash?
[16:09.69]That's impossible.
[16:12.07]Fuck.
[16:12.65]Okay, don't fuck it up.
[16:20.37]Field goal.
[16:27.07]Okay, that's enough.
[16:27.73]What?
[16:38.24]How did that not go through?
[16:41.18]That didn't go through.
[16:41.90]How is that not going through?
[17:03.19]No good.
[17:04.39]No good.
[17:04.93]Bad field goal.
[17:05.89]What?
[17:12.79]Alright, stay.
[17:14.29]I'm not going to let you do that.
[17:16.77]Who's the guy I need to be looking for?
[17:20.12]What team are they on?
[17:21.06]I mean, their team.
[17:22.14]Are they on offense or defense?
[17:24.60]Nope.
[17:24.88]Not going to happen.
[17:26.48]So, they're on defense.
[17:30.28]Okay.
[17:40.32]You gotta break all their legs.
[17:42.58]I gotta score a point.
[17:51.31]Hurt him.
[17:57.24]Oh, by the way.
[17:58.62]I heard that Vinny hosted me for like 30 seconds or something.
[18:03.92]Last stream.
[18:05.06]During, I think, somebody's brain exploding.
[18:09.45]And then he immediately unhosted and went live.
[18:12.17]So everybody got to see, like, five seconds of somebody's, like, brain blowing up.
[18:16.69]And then, like, Vinny's stream started.
[18:21.72]When somebody told me that, I was fucking laughing.
[18:23.28]Like, something bad happened.
[18:24.34]Whoa, I gotta catch this!
[18:34.85]Oh, stand up!
[18:35.61]Oh wait, is Coxby acting up here?
[18:36.73]Nice... Nice Taco Bell uniform.
[19:04.07]Oh, I had the ball, too.
[19:06.97]No, why did you say something so funny?
[19:14.48]I didn't use any time.
[19:15.76]Oh, my God.
[19:16.46]Taco Bell.
[19:17.18]The Las Vegas Taco Bell.
[19:18.90]Taco Bell.
[19:34.13]The Las Vegas Baja Blasters.
[19:36.66]No, these are the official Jirba985 colors.
[19:38.72]Oh, shut up.
[19:39.32]I can't... Oh my god!
[19:40.24]What?! !
[20:02.82]Fucking hell.
[20:05.53]Alright, come on.
[20:06.29]We gotta go for X. Bang.
[20:08.89]That defense is so good.
[20:11.15]Alright, fuck it.
[20:12.41]I'm going for it.
[20:14.15]Watch this shit.
[20:14.55]I'm going for it.
[20:35.89]The defense is so good.
[20:40.20]They're too good on defense.
[20:41.42]I have to play defense as good as they are.
[20:43.22]I have to be as good as they are.
[20:44.94]They're not gonna get shit.
[20:45.96]Alright, that's fine.
[20:46.74]Not a significant gain.
[21:05.08]He's recovered from his broken ribs.
[21:06.72]Yeah, that's usually how it happens.
[21:07.88]Get it!
[21:08.20]He's gonna play defense better than them.
[21:10.66]12 is significant, but they still have 18 yards to go.
[21:14.12]They're gonna kick a field goal here and they're gonna miss it.
[21:36.25]There you go.
[21:38.73]Good luck on your field goal attempt.
[21:40.42]Because I'm blocking it.
[21:41.86]We're a special field goal block.
[21:47.60]There's the guy with his knees, his knees closed.
[21:51.90]No, they're going for it.
[21:52.78]Oh, shit.
[21:53.56]I gotta change this.
[21:54.14]I can't believe he got it.
[22:03.12]He used his unleash, that's why.
[22:13.71]So stupid.
[22:16.71]It's alright, one... I thought he... The AI never goes forward on fourth down.
[22:22.13]You've seen that.
[22:23.41]Come on.
[22:25.21]Well, good.
[22:25.93]Fuck you, you don't get extra point.
[22:27.30]Now I can win the game easily.
[22:36.56]This is the one.
[22:51.30]Alright, that's such a huge gain.
[22:53.51]I need to take a capitalization on this.
[23:01.29]We're going Cold Smoke.
[23:03.19]First and goal.
[23:04.03]It's gut check time.
[23:09.13]How did he even get in here?
[23:12.17]How did he even get the fuck in here?
[23:13.29]Desperate.
[23:16.47]Here we go.
[23:17.23]Yeah, I squeezed on his spleen.
[23:27.20]That's it.
[23:28.42]Good old Cox.
[23:31.56]Beer chug, right?
[23:36.08]I don't think that was beer chug.
[23:37.38]But I'll be ahead now.
[23:43.76]I ain't losing this game.
[23:56.37]When did I get my own stadium?
[23:58.59]I think I just had one, right?
[24:02.92]I just had one.
[24:03.30]Come on, we're the Las Vegas Cocks!
[24:12.22]I'll bust his ankle up.
[24:13.72]Out of the... For the whole year.
[24:14.98]Broken foot.
[24:21.60]Bring out the cart.
[24:22.29]See you later.
[24:24.65]Alright.
[24:24.87]Let's play deep.
[24:36.69]That was gonna give him a new foot, sorry.
[24:41.33]No, not this time.
[24:51.27]End of the quarter.
[24:54.79]How is that a minor injury?
[24:55.85]Uh, well.
[24:58.68]In this universe.
[25:00.38]I think your limbs just, there's like drugs that you inject.
[25:04.38]Where it makes your limbs grow back.
[25:10.29]They're down.
[25:12.17]And I get the ball.
[25:13.05]And we'll make a touchdown.
[25:14.29]And the game will be unreachable.
[25:15.81]And we'll be 8-1.
[25:17.08]Alright, watch this guy.
[25:23.22]Number 15.
[25:27.16]Get out of my fucking life!
[25:28.68]Taco Bell.
[25:29.48]And I have an unleash.
[25:30.86]Boomer announcer.
[25:31.52]Now you're gonna punt it?
[25:32.77]Oh fuck, somebody has to get back there.
[25:34.05]Get back there!
[25:34.45]Somebody!
[25:35.01]Anyone!
[25:35.19]You!
[25:35.55]No, you're like small!
[25:36.59]Okay.
[26:01.60]Check it.
[26:03.16]Alright.
[26:09.28]I still have an Unleash.
[26:12.68]I'm so ready for this.
[26:13.50]I'm just going to run.
[26:15.90]Why would I fake Field Goal?
[26:20.53]HP float left.
[26:22.33]Don't even need the Star Player.
[26:27.97]And I still have it.
[26:32.73]So do they, though.
[26:33.55]Alright.
[26:34.99]I gotta get a touchdown right now.
[26:36.89]We're going with a trick play.
[26:37.75]We're gonna do Maniac.
[26:39.24]Check that top left corner.
[26:41.10]Into the end zone.
[26:41.82]Into the dice.
[26:43.76]With an unleash.
[26:44.28]I'm gonna do an unleash catch.
[26:47.50]What just happened?
[26:52.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[26:53.79]Hold on!
[26:54.09]Hold on!
[27:13.26]What happened?
[27:17.11]What was that?
[27:17.81]How did they intercept the ball?
[27:26.45]I am so confused right now.
[27:27.71]I can't even laugh at that.
[27:31.55]I have no replay.
[27:35.70]Did he steal the handoff?
[27:42.55]He ran into the handoff.
[27:48.47]I have no fucking idea what happened there.
[27:50.10]I can't believe it.
[27:56.68]How do you intercept a handoff?
[28:09.26]Block it again.
[28:19.45]It's alright.
[28:19.87]I just need a touchdown.
[28:21.19]And I win the game.
[28:23.01]Just get a touchdown and the game's over.
[28:25.03]This is a good position to be in.
[28:25.93]I got two timeouts.
[28:28.15]I have no meter, but that's okay.
[28:33.22]Just don't fumble the goddamn ball.
[28:37.14]okay here we go holy good thing he's got insurance we're gonna go intertwine back to pass gets rid of it come on come on stay up he's brought down at the 38 yard line Las Vegas had everyone on the same page there okay I got meter with a very nice game

[29:05.66]30 yards to go.
[29:06.48]Wall at the 38.
[29:10.32]Looking for room on the right side.
[29:11.82]God damn it.
[29:12.86]He's brought down.
[29:14.72]Damn it!
[29:15.08]I gotta get it right now.
[29:15.96]Come on!
[29:23.20]This is it.
[29:23.64]Right here.
[29:23.90]Into the end zone.
[29:27.28]Go look to throw.
[29:29.20]Across the middle.
[29:33.50]Recovered in the endzone!
[29:37.42]That deserves a shot of a beer!
[29:45.82]Look at that.
[29:48.91]Just get a field goal, and I win the game.
[29:51.41]Probably.
[29:51.93]Oh yeah, that felt good.
[29:58.43]That one felt good.
[30:00.67]Seven seconds to get a field goal.
[30:05.06]That ain't gonna happen.
[30:12.41]I got meter.
[30:13.01]He doesn't.
[30:14.81]Just get a tackle.
[30:19.59]Two.
[30:20.43]One.
[30:20.59]Alright, he's... Okay, he's got one play.
[30:23.24]He doesn't have an unleash.
[30:24.30]He has one play.
[30:26.24]We're just gonna do full coverage here.
[30:30.14]Complete just coverage.
[30:31.46]Just lock it down.
[30:32.92]Man up.
[30:34.67]I don't care how many yards they get.
[30:35.85]Just stay in the back.
[30:40.43]See you later, Game Over Island.
[30:42.07]14-13.
[30:42.85]There it is.
[30:43.77]How much money am I going to get for this one?
[30:45.61]Off to a good start.
[31:09.54]And I wagered a lot of money, didn't I?
[31:12.10]Yeah.
[31:12.60]Oh, well.
[31:13.92]Oh, well.
[31:16.56]200 grand.
[31:19.06]I guess that was a really low-scoring game, huh?
[31:23.41]You pulled that one out of your ass, and I respect that.
[31:27.35]I tried.
[31:27.69]Thanks.
[31:33.63]Watch the movies.
[31:34.67]These are the team intros.
[31:37.39]When they introduce the captain of the team.
[31:40.40]Alright, Tara, what's up?
[31:41.20]Can't see him?

[32:05.35]I'm sure you do, honey.
[32:06.75]But can you keep up?
[32:08.49]You'll need to prove it first.
[32:10.33]Prove it?
[32:11.36]What are we talking about here?

[32:43.64]Okay.
[32:45.30]I think I can handle that.
[32:46.10]Alright, how are we doing on injuries?
[32:51.52]Sullivan is still up for two games.
[32:53.16]How?
[32:55.99]It's already been one game.
[32:56.83]He had medical staff on him.
[33:01.53]What the hell was that all about?
[33:02.47]Oh well.
[33:06.15]I don't think I have enough money for anything.
[33:11.97]260, 220.
[33:12.15]I don't have any money.
[33:15.67]What about drugs?
[33:17.97]Let's see.
[33:20.59]Generate two stamina.
[33:23.40]Increases the severity of injuries caused by juiced player.
[33:28.34]So, I'm going to take this.
[33:29.66]And I'm just going to try to hurt as many.
[33:33.74]That's a high risk though.
[33:36.21]I can't do that.
[33:36.83]Look at the risk.
[33:41.30]I can't do it.
[33:45.14]It's maxed out right now.
[33:46.76]Yeah, I can't do that.
[33:50.79]I wish I could get my halfback back.
[33:57.21]Atlanta 404 is the next team.
[34:03.59]Just take the legal ones.
[34:07.09]Take the legal ones!
[34:09.68]All of these are illegal On the left It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs yeah, but I mean that I they're gonna be searching my bag I
[34:44.40]Yeah, but I... Fine, I'll take it.
[34:49.86]I'll take the legal drug.
[34:54.30]It says legal.
[34:55.17]I know, but just because it's legal doesn't mean I can do it.
[34:59.43]They're checking.
[35:00.71]I just got out of prison.
[35:06.05]Let's go.
[35:06.69]Atlanta 404.
[35:10.00]They have insane defense.
[35:12.54]I'm not betting on this game.
[35:14.38]They almost have a maxed out defense.
[35:25.18]Next up, we got the Atlanta 404.
[35:27.75]This team's only been in the league for three years, but their defense is so destructive, they've already made it into division two.
[35:36.27]I gotta be aware of this.
[35:37.19]I gotta be careful.
[35:38.31]Best defense in the league.
[36:03.84]You're under arrest for buying those groceries legally.
[36:09.76]You just have a note.
[36:18.51]He just launches himself into someone.
[36:20.95]He probably causes a lot of injuries.
[36:22.05]So, lockdown, defense, and they're off... They're a defense team.
[36:26.63]I just have to score a shitload of points.
[36:32.52]Or prevent them from scoring.
[36:36.66]I get the kickoff.
[36:37.36]Let's make it happen.
[36:38.16]Alright.
[36:39.00]Watch out for the guy.
[36:42.81]Whoa.
[36:44.77]He just hit me so hard I started to T-pose.
[36:49.73]This is not going to go well.
[36:52.43]Okay.
[36:55.17]We're going to go with... I don't want to do pass plays.
[36:57.29]Okay.
[37:01.75]Jesus!
[37:02.71]Alright.
[37:03.25]Plan B. Oh my god.
[37:03.95]Oh, this is bad.
[37:04.49]Oh, that defense is so good.
[37:06.21]They just knock it out of you.
[37:36.79]Oh, you fucking idiot!
[37:40.64]WHAT THE HAPPEN?!
[37:41.46]Uh, okay.
[37:44.30]I- I blame that on where my hands were on the controller.
[37:52.20]I blame my- where my hands were.
[37:54.36]My, like, cold, sweat, slippery hands.
[38:01.69]Jesus Christ.
[38:02.61]Okay, well, let's, uh...
[38:06.10]Let's get over the fact that I just lost 20% stamina on two people and then got an interception.
[38:14.77]You can't stop them.
[38:17.95]They can't be stopped.
[38:22.36]He's got an Unleash too.
[38:24.96]This is really bad.
[38:31.64]First and 30.
[38:37.18]How did that not stop him?
[38:42.42]I'm so afraid of that.
[38:44.24]Ugh, he's gonna unleash and kill somebody.
[38:53.23]Oh, no!
[38:59.24]Thank god you held onto the ball cocked.
[39:06.89]That was a full dropkick.
[39:08.96]Alright, well thank god I have it.
[39:09.96]How the hell am I going to deal with this?
[39:11.62]Okay.
[39:13.40]I have to punt it.
[39:17.64]I have to.
[39:40.77]I can't go down by 14 points immediately.
[39:55.03]Good hit.
[39:59.71]Atlanta's making you look like a CPU.
[40:03.67]Well, they did have double my stats.
[40:07.20]So, you know, there's only so much you can work with here.
[40:11.73]I'll sit him in the championship and I'll beat him.
[40:13.37]He'll have zero points.
[40:18.07]The ball carrier was just tenderized, skewered, grilled, and eaten up by the defenders.
[40:24.06]39 yards to go.
[40:30.40]Wow.
[40:31.22]And that's the end of the third quarter as Atlanta leads by seven.
[40:36.28]That's alright.
[40:37.54]That's not out of reach.
[40:42.92]I have to hurt somebody, right?
[40:45.86]I gotta impress my new girlfriend.
[40:47.83]Who's gonna get hurt?
[40:53.45]Huh?
[40:59.92]How did you catch that ball?
[41:04.86]Hurt him.
[41:05.20]Come on.
[41:05.54]Hurt.
[41:06.62]Damn it.
[41:07.16]That was an opportunity to hurt him.
[41:11.99]Didn't get it well.
[41:13.27]I do have an Unleash.
[41:15.35]It's 4th down.
[41:17.55]They're probably going to punt.
[41:22.10]Yep.
[41:28.20]Here's my chance to get it back.
[41:34.25]Bryant, let's go.
[41:39.74]I wasn't going to use it there.
[41:44.64]Alright.
[41:45.22]I need to get a touchdown.
[41:46.42]We're going to go with world record crisscross.
[41:50.81]First down, 30 yards to go.
[42:07.68]Mercury.
[42:19.87]I tried to do an unleash but it wouldn't happen.
[42:22.47]Fuck.
[42:23.87]I gotta go for a run.
[42:25.93]I gotta unleash run.
[42:34.04]Good.
[42:39.40]There it is.
[42:39.86]No, get up!
[42:44.76]Get up and grow!
[42:53.13]You have a broken humorous.
[42:58.50]Just get the field goal.
[42:59.14]Tag him.
[42:59.46]Dab.
[43:09.35]See?
[43:09.69]It's like it never happened.
[43:21.18]All the way back.
[43:21.72]Great kick.
[43:26.84]Injure, injure, injure.
[43:28.06]Uh-oh.
[43:30.25]What the fuck happened?
[43:31.07]Why did they all just freak out?
[43:32.41]They all, like... Because I was trying to get... Okay, I see what happened.
[43:34.45]I was trying to get the... I was trying to get him.
[43:40.48]Injure.
[43:40.82]I know.
[43:41.00]I'm trying.
[43:41.45]I'm trying to injure somebody.
[43:50.05]I'm afraid to do a blitz.
[43:52.89]But... You know.
[43:54.34]I'm just gonna stay back.
[44:01.82]Injury.
[44:03.64]Excuse me?
[44:05.24]Excuse me?
[44:05.88]Why did he dive through him?
[44:07.75]Ex... Hold on.
[44:09.17]What was that?
[44:11.66]I fucking dove through him.
[44:14.46]Look, I'm waiting for him, waiting for him.
[44:22.47]What the hell?
[44:30.46]Fucking cartoon dog shit.
[44:33.42]Whatever.
[44:41.13]I can't believe what just happened.
[44:43.23]I got in his eye frame.
[44:45.39]He dodge rolled me.
[44:47.65]He was already in a tackle pattern.
[44:50.57]God damn it.
[44:52.52]I need to... He's gonna get the ball too.
[44:54.24]I have to score a touchdown right now.
[44:57.36]And he has an unleash.
[44:58.02]Get to the fucking outside.
[44:58.98]What am I gonna do with this?
[45:08.32]I wonder if I can get him to burn his...
[45:11.91]Unleash.
[45:13.17]That would be ideal.
[45:19.12]Cut it!
[45:19.42]Cut it!
[45:19.94]Cut out!
[45:20.56]Cut out!
[45:25.92]Alright, get it!
[45:28.64]It's okay, go outside!
[45:29.52]Out of bounds!
[45:30.78]No!
[45:33.12]Who is this?
[45:38.78]Oh, it's Ashley.
[45:41.10]They'll be alright.
[45:43.38]Out for six games.
[45:44.34]Fuck.
[45:45.60]Okay, I still have a chance here.
[45:50.06]I got a timeout after this.
[45:51.18]Drop middle.
[46:07.46]Come on, I gotta get this.
[46:15.64]Shit.
[46:21.91]I gotta, okay, we're gonna fake field goal.
[46:23.71]Touchdown.
[46:29.57]Oh, it's a fake.
[46:38.51]Oh, well.
[46:39.69]What were you thinking?
[46:40.65]I don't know.
[46:41.13]I don't know why I did that.
[46:43.74]Injury.
[47:10.91]Could have done square.
[47:12.00]Yeah, but every time I've thrown it to a guy that crosses.
[47:15.38]He just caught my foot.
[47:23.19]It's the extra challenge of throwing to guys with three defenders.
[47:25.77]Injury.
[47:27.49]Damn it!
[47:29.83]That was such a good hit too.
[47:44.96]There it is.
[47:46.40]It's the quarterback too.
[47:47.54]He's in deep shit.
[47:48.59]There it is.
[47:56.27]That was the painful one.
[47:58.75]And I have an unleash.
[48:00.17]So, third and 26.
[48:01.89]Just a minor injury to the balls.
[48:16.54]I don't think so.
[48:19.04]Not going to happen.
[48:20.54]Fourth down.
[48:20.96]Give me the ball.
[48:22.50]Alright, I'm going to play safe here.
[48:29.80]Just prevent.
[48:30.74]Oh, god damn it!
[48:31.55]He's punting it!
[48:37.37]I always think he's going to go for it.
[48:40.12]And then when he doesn't go for it... It's okay.
[48:46.62]Check it!
[48:53.53]Good.
[48:58.39]Why would he not punt on 4th and 20?
[48:59.70]Because this game is insane.
[49:02.16]And they do insane things.
[49:04.10]First down and 30.
[49:18.04]Let's go home.
[49:19.03]Fuck.
[49:19.21]Okay.
[49:19.33]Tie game.
[49:19.83]Pretty good mud physics.
[49:21.15]This game... This game stands up.
[49:22.81]It does.
[49:23.33]No... I actually forget the beer chug code.
[49:24.77]I think it's XX circle circle.
[49:47.76]Rev up the Friars.
[49:52.64]I'm in a good spot.
[50:02.75]The cheerleaders in this game look dead inside.
[50:06.07]They do have that kind of just stone-cold face, don't they?
[50:11.91]First down.
[50:12.45]30 yards to go.
[50:13.71]Ball at the 27-yard line.
[50:17.51]Here we go, watch this left side.
[50:24.51]And you ain't got nothing.
[50:29.26]I would be too if I was dancing in this weather.
[50:34.29]Yeah.
[50:38.99]balance we're gonna go with uh jammer I don't know guys I just want to make sure this is clear with everybody watching I I don't know what any of these mean
[50:52.86]I mean, I have a general idea, but I don't really follow football that much.
[50:56.29]I don't know, like, for instance, I know, like, cover and blitz and zone.
[51:00.97]I don't know what any of these fucking things really mean, though.
[51:04.51]I'm doing the thing where you play Madden against your friend, and neither one of you know what the fuck you're doing.
[51:09.30]You're just picking random plays.
[51:12.94]Having a great time, though.
[51:14.12]I think we're doing okay.
[51:17.50]I have no idea.
[51:26.53]Does it matter?
[51:27.21]Not really.
[51:30.76]Okay, this is 4th and 31.
[51:31.76]I wonder if he's going to punt him.
[51:36.62]Why are you allowed just to beat people up?
[51:39.74]Because this is Blitz.
[51:45.82]I might be able to run this back for a touchdown.
[51:48.22]It's possible.
[51:53.91]Here we go, touchdown.
[51:55.91]Got it.
[51:57.03]Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[52:00.05]Alright, good, good, good.
[52:00.97]Turn on the facecam.
[52:02.19]I don't have any clothes on, I can't.
[52:03.97]Do I just say, fuck it, and try to go for it?
[52:06.11]Fuck it.
[52:06.29]Right up the middle.
[52:30.61]Oh well.
[52:42.00]That was a mistake.
[52:42.88]Yeah, it was.
[52:45.14]I tend to make those here.
[52:50.57]I wanted to try to make it so if he got a touchdown, it wouldn't have mattered.
[52:57.03]But now all he needs is a touchdown to win the game.
[53:01.62]And I'm embarrassed.
[53:03.74]I'm ashamed.
[53:04.44]Do you have a six-pack?
[53:05.00]Yeah, dude.
[53:05.30]Bullshit?
[53:05.58]Yeah, dude.
[53:21.02]Let's go with, uh, deep zones.
[53:27.42]Jerma works out every night?
[53:28.44]No, I mean I do, I do five hundred crunches a day.
[53:38.68]Half a dozen donuts is not a six pack.
[53:41.72]Yes it is.
[53:45.17]I do at least five, I probably do, no, you know what, I probably do a thousand crunches a day.
[53:52.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[53:57.35]How is it fucking possible that Otto, of all people, how many tackles are you going to break after a fumble?
[54:05.03]Really?
[54:06.29]What?
[54:08.25]This is un-fucking-believable.
[54:16.44]That's unbelievable.
[54:20.02]He broke like seven or eight different tackles.
[54:23.16]After a fucking fumble.
[54:25.94]Guy gets it and just covers himself in oil and then runs through.
[54:28.94]Fuck.
[54:29.04]This is bad.
[54:29.50]Fumble.
[54:45.58]I popped his fucking water balloon.
[54:47.10]Good.
[54:55.51]I have it unleashed too.
[54:56.35]Third and goal.
[55:00.13]This is the game right here.
[55:03.99]I have to unleash right here because he's going to get a field goal, right?
[55:07.33]Unleash it.
[55:11.92]Why were they walking off the field?
[55:17.78]We need to stop him right here, right now.
[55:20.62]Okay.
[55:22.30]Are they going for it?
[55:23.14]Yep, they're going for it.
[55:26.82]It's all or nothing.
[55:28.15]527.
[55:30.13]527.
[55:30.17]He'll look to throw.
[55:32.47]He's got it.
[55:35.23]Nothing.
[55:35.81]Yeah.
[55:36.11]And he's tackled at the two-yard line.
[55:38.57]And they turn the ball over.
[55:39.59]Now, they could have used some points right there, but the defense said, uh-uh, no way.
[55:44.10]Big stop there.
[55:45.64]I got an unleash, too. 45.
[55:49.75]I'm surprised I actually didn't unleash that one.
[55:54.76]Same deal, run it.
[55:55.56]Run it.
[55:56.30]They don't got any more timeouts.
[56:01.22]And then fucking punt it if I have to.
[56:09.97]Oh no!
[56:10.61]Please tell me that wasn't his knee.
[56:24.88]See you later.
[56:28.22]Break the tackle!
[56:31.40]I just, like, fell down.
[56:32.66]Game over.
[56:33.12]I win.
[56:37.80]Keep that record going.
[56:41.42]Did I just walk across the field and sprangle somebody?
[56:45.03]I think I... Yeah, I just... That was awesome.
[56:51.97]That's a win.
[56:58.12]Another close call, but still able to keep it going.
[57:07.66]Now I got $430,000.
[57:09.82]I injured somebody, so I'm going to get a new girlfriend.
[57:13.16]Right?
[57:15.58]Man, enough for Tara.
[57:16.76]$5,000 cash.
[57:17.30]Okay.
[57:28.32]Let's see what that means.
[57:32.39]Here's Taro.
[57:32.73]What?
[57:33.19]Oh.
[57:33.39]Well.
[57:33.49]Uh, sure.
[57:33.77]I guess.
[57:53.06]Oh, this might be bad.
[57:54.40]I might have to, uh... Okay, let's, uh... Hope you don't mind.
[57:59.40]I brought a friend.
[58:01.06]Okay.
[58:03.00]An incoming sensor ruptured spleen.
[58:06.36]No.
[58:08.77]I'm gonna, like, fall out of bed and rupture my spleen.
[58:18.83]I'm gonna roll out of bed and, like, explode my collarbone.
[58:25.27]Son, do you know how fast you were going?
[58:27.51]I was going 70.
[58:28.05]68.
[58:28.07]Uh-oh.
[58:28.27]This is not good.
[58:29.29]Do I answer this phone?
[58:54.59]Oh, real nice, you jerk.
[58:56.23]I can't believe you did this to me.
[58:58.05]And with her?
[58:59.99]Don't call me again.
[59:10.42]Hey, killer.
[59:11.56]How you doing?
[59:12.84]You need anything besides me, that is?
[59:16.30]Look, I know people.
[59:18.02]People who can get me the stuff you and your teammates can use.
[59:21.19]And I could get it at cost.
[59:22.93]Just don't ask me where or how.
[59:25.02]Let me know what you need and how much, and I'll hook you up.
[59:27.55]I don't want, like, an illegal girlfriend, you know what I mean?
[59:29.83]Like, do any legal things.
[59:33.27]Kim was by the book.
[59:34.71]This is, like, illegal girlfriend.
[59:36.39]Oh, I do things illegally.
[59:37.97]No, I want Kim back.
[59:46.62]Tara gets you drug discounts.
[59:50.66]I'm in love.
[59:52.38]Those are expensive.
[60:01.22]Okay, we need some Resist Injury, Break Tackle maybe, or Strength.
[60:13.33]This game is something else.
[60:15.71]It is a timeless classic.
[60:20.72]I'm going to say Strength.
[60:26.28]And these two are called Weights.
[60:27.86]Yeah, Strength.
[60:30.17]I got 150.
[60:31.80]How much of a discount, though?
[60:34.06]That's all I can do.
[60:36.54]Who's still injured?
[60:37.32]Okay.
[60:38.00]Oh, man.
[60:39.04]Oh, man.
[60:39.42]That's not good.
[60:42.62]Five games.
[60:43.38]Okay, so we got the... Our good halfback is in the game again.
[60:49.59]I need some more medical staff.
[60:50.67]How much is it for?
[60:51.41]Yeah, just get it.
[60:56.47]Good.
[61:01.24]Juicing.
[61:01.60]Let's see how much of a discount it is.
[61:05.17]7.
[61:05.59]That's a monumental discount.
[61:07.49]This was like, what, 60?
[61:08.55]This was like $50,000 or $60,000 before.
[61:15.17]This is so cheap now.
[61:20.22]Juiced player is immune to injury.
[61:24.28]It wasn't like that before, was it?
[61:30.76]Well, I'll take the legal one.
[61:33.48]I'm going to give the halfback a... I'm going to give the halfback a legal drug, too.
[61:42.17]Everyone's going to take aspirin.
[61:44.51]Whatever the hell this is.
[61:48.80]Okay, what about the catcher?
[61:49.82]Should the catcher have something?
[61:55.02]Lame streamer.
[61:57.28]Look at the team risk.
[61:58.23]If I take an illegal drug right now...
[62:04.85]Alright.
[62:05.83]Who's up next?
[62:06.63]We got the Washington Redhawks.
[62:09.97]Okay.
[62:11.43]Sure.
[62:17.26]Scroll down on the injuries.
[62:23.08]Oh, shit.
[62:23.54]That's right.
[62:23.80]No, this is only two.
[62:31.97]Those are the only two that are there.
[62:33.63]Alright.
[62:33.87]I got to... Hey, it's been an hour.
[62:36.14]That means I got to pee.
[62:37.92]So welcome to the bi-hourly but quarterly hourly piss.
[62:43.45]First one of the night.
[62:44.35]See you in a minute.
[65:54.67]Where the hell did he go?
[65:55.47]Alright.
[66:03.19]So we're a new game versus Washington.
[66:10.48]Alright.
[66:10.70]Not as awful as last.
[66:12.68]0-3.
[66:16.20]Hmm.
[66:18.00]Win by more than 10 points.
[66:21.24]Did I wash my hands?
[66:23.20]Yeah.
[66:24.74]I rinsed them, and I did soap.
[66:30.38]25,000 max bet.
[66:34.94]To a team that's 0-3.
[66:36.16]Then stat-wise, they're not that much better.
[66:41.97]I'm max betting it.
[66:43.93]Let's try.
[66:46.43]Alright, quarterback.
[66:47.35]Washington.
[67:18.70]So injure him, is what you're saying.
[67:33.57]Break him, break him.
[67:34.83]Look, I'm gonna try.
[67:35.57]That's what I do every game.
[67:45.81]I go for the attack.
[67:51.07]I'm not going to ever be able to think about anything besides Taco Bell now.
[67:57.67]I laughed about it even on the way downstairs.
[68:02.74]Break his neck.
[68:03.74]Look, I'm going to try to do whatever I can.
[68:06.56]Ow.
[68:09.32]He's the quarterback, right?
[68:13.58]Let's start it with just a fucked up trick play.
[68:24.25]I didn't even, did I not pick one?
[68:25.41]That's going the other way.
[68:38.62]Fumble it again, fumble.
[68:40.00]Fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble, give it back.
[68:47.80]God damn.
[68:49.12]Hang on, hang on, buddy.
[68:50.16]Turn over.
[68:51.10]Here, let me help you, let me help you.
[68:57.84]That was loud and scary.
[69:08.20]I tried to go in for the kill there.
[69:11.53]A little more juice.
[69:17.39]Shit.
[69:17.75]Why did I... I did like a bomb pass the first play of the game.
[69:23.55]We got an Unleashed.
[69:25.07]I think I gotta go for it here.
[69:26.93]Got it.
[69:27.47]Oh, watch this one.
[69:28.03]Run it back for a touchdown right now.
[69:30.25]See you later.
[70:01.50]Yes!
[70:01.70]Let's make him 0-4.
[70:02.22]Really pushing your luck there?
[70:04.84]Well, if I had got tackled, I would have landed in the end zone.
[70:07.48]So, it's okay.
[70:08.94]Oops-a-daisy.
[70:09.38]That's not a good kick at all.
[70:43.46]Drunk Madden.
[70:46.66]He has no commentary at all.
[70:48.20]By the way, there is no commentary.
[70:53.08]The guy just says the name of the play, what yardage it is, and then drunk John Madden talks about, like, diapers.
[70:59.76]Here we go.
[71:19.50]Fumble.
[71:21.16]Oh.
[71:23.90]Fumble.
[71:26.48]I killed him, but he didn't fumble the ball.
[71:31.22]Spinal cord.
[71:33.83]No, he's not dead.
[71:34.51]Yeah, get it out here.
[71:43.49]They got so many yards on that team.
[71:46.97]No, ain't gonna happen.
[71:54.39]Get that late hit.
[71:56.62]Shit.
[71:58.98]Let's go to the bottom edge.
[72:03.10]I gotta go for an injury here.
[72:04.00]Nope.
[72:07.44]He's not gonna get it.
[72:11.17]He's in a bad spot right now.
[72:12.19]He's at like 73.
[72:13.53]74.
[72:15.11]And I have an Unleash.
[72:20.26]Third and goal.
[72:21.28]Hmm.
[72:23.48]The question is, do I use the Unleash now and try to prevent a touchdown, but they'll get a field goal, or do I... I'll take it.
[72:33.32]Didn't even need to use it.
[72:40.54]Alright, I got my halfback back.
[72:42.70]28 is back.
[72:44.52]Let's get out of the fucking end zone.
[72:51.15]Get off!
[72:53.05]Oh!
[73:01.46]Oh, look at me!
[73:09.65]Wow, that was awesome That is exactly what I wanted to have happen 99 yard run And the extra point is good
[73:33.60]Solve it MVP.
[73:37.83]Yeah.
[73:38.19]We didn't have him for at least two or three games straight.
[73:47.62]That was a 100 yard.
[73:52.28]That guy deserves extra drugs after this game.
[73:54.52]Yeah.
[73:57.65]Definitely.
[74:04.19]He deserves extra drugs.
[74:09.73]Good old Mr. Super Bowl.
[74:19.56]I'm kind of surprised that he... got away from that.
[74:26.37]He's really fast.
[74:30.39]No.
[74:31.61]Let's go for like a blitz.
[74:33.67]Goodbye.
[74:37.31]See you later.
[74:38.91]I think that deserves a chuck.
[74:59.68]I'm up by so much now.
[75:02.54]Well, I told you there's a reason why you're 0-3.
[75:05.90]Let's go for it.
[75:06.42]22-0.
[75:29.65]Have you considered becoming a professional NFL Blitz player?
[75:34.64]Um, yeah.
[75:35.78]I have.
[75:36.06]There's only one problem, though.
[75:39.88]I think I'm the only person that owns this game right now.
[75:43.98]So I would be... It'd be an AI tournament.
[75:48.64]The NFL Blitz The League 2 tournament series.
[75:52.27]It would just be me against AI opponents in a giant stadium.
[76:04.69]See you later, the quarterback.
[76:05.63]That's like a broken tailbone.
[76:12.77]That's the guy that I had to go after.
[76:14.35]Hang on, buddy.
[76:16.27]Let me help you.
[76:17.43]Let me help you.
[76:19.07]Five games.
[76:21.01]There's the start player.
[76:24.49]They don't have a chance.
[76:28.13]Brown 80.
[76:29.70]Brown 80.
[76:34.40]Trying to injure their other quarterback.
[76:35.60]What happens if you run into all quarterbacks?
[76:37.86]Do you have to have, like, the safety play quarterback?
[76:43.35]Fourth down.
[76:50.75]You're gonna have to punt it.
[76:53.99]Alright, punch that guy in the face.
[76:59.60]Aww.
[77:00.54]Get him!
[77:01.18]Do it!
[77:03.21]There goes my appetite.
[77:10.34]Yeah, this is probably a good game to eat, too.
[77:13.12]I'm about to get the ball back again.
[77:15.56]I'm gonna go with the, uh... Trank!
[77:37.23]No, not 28.
[77:38.13]Not 28 again.
[77:40.13]He's fine.
[77:42.47]Thank God.
[77:43.05]He would have been out for another four games.
[77:47.27]Oh, that would have been an awesome juke.
[77:59.24]Thank God.
[77:59.52]Timeout.
[78:05.50]Let me get a touchdown here.
[78:10.43]Crucial series of downs here.
[78:12.13]Ball spotted at the 13-yard line.
[78:19.36]Two-point conversion again.
[78:20.28]I bet on this game, didn't I?
[78:21.16]Yeah, I did.
[78:21.56]I put max $25,000 on this game.
[78:22.60]Fuck, now I gotta kick it off.
[78:24.06]Idiot.
[78:50.87]Three seconds for them to score a touchdown.
[78:54.85]Let's just prevent.
[78:55.57]We're gonna go just straight up.
[78:58.71]Four men in the backfield.
[79:00.73]They're going for a bomb pass.
[79:07.70]And sorry.
[79:11.64]Yeah, the announcer's Frank Caliendo.
[79:19.34]I gotta get more... This is the kind of game you have to make money.
[79:23.46]Because this team sucks.
[79:25.28]So... I already have at least 50 grand coming in from the bet.
[79:34.05]Somebody pick it up.
[79:35.83]That's what I'm talking about.
[79:36.69]Just get, like, fucking 500 grand from this game.
[79:42.35]Shut out.
[79:42.93]It's alright.
[79:43.21]It's still game.
[79:43.71]Let's run it in there.
[79:45.75]Aw, damn it.
[79:46.29]It's alright.
[79:46.69]Just get in there slowly.
[80:10.19]Turn up the difficulty.
[80:11.13]Easy.
[80:11.39]Now I have to win these.
[80:12.11]By a lot.
[80:40.03]Do the beer chug on cam.
[80:46.68]He flew in the air.
[80:49.60]I'm going to take the shot.
[80:56.08]I'm going to try to win by 50 points.
[80:58.22]50 to 0.
[80:58.60]That's what I'm going for here.
[81:06.51]This guy's down at 60%.
[81:11.10]One bad injury to this guy.
[81:14.38]He'll never play again.
[81:21.74]Crush will go with the Blitz.
[81:25.38]Just take everybody over here.
[81:26.34]No fumble.
[81:39.57]Can you actually, can somebody actually get murdered?
[81:42.59]Yeah, they can go out for the whole year.
[81:45.25]Or forever, I think.
[81:47.15]My character, like, died in the game, didn't he?
[81:51.33]Technically.
[81:52.13]Who caught it?
[81:54.10]Um, excuse me, I don't, there's no explanation for what just happened.
[81:57.80]I don't, who caught that ball?
[82:06.04]Okay, he dodges that and then threw it over here?
[82:13.44]The guy behind him caught it without looking.
[82:15.74]It went into his hand.
[82:18.44]I was trying to tackle that guy and I did tackle that guy.
[82:21.50]That's weird.
[82:29.52]He was running the opposite direction without looking.
[82:31.40]It went right into his hand.
[82:34.05]You toot.
[82:34.97]How do you miss that?
[82:35.79]Both of you.
[82:37.93]It's okay.
[82:39.45]No shutout, bud.
[82:58.84]Jeremy, you've landed like 50 punches on camera.
[83:01.78]Alright, let's go with the run.
[83:03.16]Here comes his unleash.
[83:04.32]It's probably going to be a fumble or an injured player, so I don't know why I'm giving it to my star player.
[83:25.35]I'm so terrified of it.
[83:28.53]Don't give the ball to that... It's time to just play... Easy.
[83:34.81]No reason to give it to the halfback anymore.
[83:36.33]Not at this point.
[83:40.65]And I gave it to him!
[83:43.20]Ha ha ha!
[83:58.72]Red zone, let's do it again.
[84:00.18]This time we're going to do Bolton.
[84:03.74]Tight end.
[84:04.10]Oh well.
[84:08.14]It was worth a shot.
[84:09.11]Forget it, 1,000 yards season.
[84:27.23]That's my star player.
[84:28.35]Thank God.
[84:32.70]I think if... If Franchise gets an injury, the game ends.
[84:38.58]So, just keep that in mind.
[84:40.48]That's why I was a little concerned there.
[84:43.64]How did I not get that?
[84:47.77]Still got it.
[84:58.89]I don't know how.
[84:59.69]50 points.
[85:00.13]What do you say you chug it?
[85:01.29]Oh, yeah.
[85:01.71]Woo-hoo.
[85:29.39]50 points.
[85:29.79]Let's go, again, quarterback dash.
[85:33.55]There's no way he's going to do that twice in a row, right?
[85:49.50]Things are going well.
[85:50.66]50 to 6.
[85:52.88]And I still have an unleash that I'm going to use right now.
[85:58.33]What percentage is this guy at right now?
[86:00.22]How can he still be standing?
[86:01.22]It's alright.
[86:03.08]Why did he just die?
[86:16.79]The guy that fell down is the one that got the hit.
[86:18.63]This is on PlayStation 3.
[86:19.63]Yeah, not on Xbox right now.
[86:20.80]PS3.
[86:20.90]Fuck.
[86:21.06]Oh, he deserves it.
[86:21.84]You deserve it.
[86:22.32]Yeah, you deserve it.
[86:54.73]You're not kicking a field goal Run the whole thing back, come on What does this mean?
[87:09.40]This is just a failed conversion I was trying to build up points
[87:30.58]Well, it doesn't matter.
[87:32.92]Dermot, that's two points.
[87:34.78]I thought it was just a... No, it's a two-point conversion, right?
[87:37.22]So I thought that's just a failed conversion.
[87:42.11]Not the halfback, please!
[87:43.59]God damn it!
[87:49.75]The first game, you come back.
[87:51.36]Of the seven games!
[87:52.88]God, Jesus!
[87:59.29]That sucks.
[87:59.73]That actually sucks.
[88:27.03]Triangle, triangle, triangle, X. I'll try it.
[88:29.71]That guy... He's gonna get it.
[88:30.93]No, he's not.
[88:31.29]I don't care.
[88:38.14]I'm playing like a clown right now because it doesn't matter.
[89:05.98]Some kind of currency thing.
[89:08.42]Is it?
[89:08.62]I don't know.
[89:11.80]How long is the story mode?
[89:14.78]We are currently in the second division of one more division.
[89:21.93]So the Division 2, Division 1, and I'm assuming like the championship of the whole game.
[89:28.17]So it seems like we're halfway through the second division, or about to be.
[89:32.92]How did he fall off?
[89:36.36]End them right now or I'm going to leave.
[89:38.34]I'm going.
[89:38.74]I've taken out at least like four people on their team.
[89:40.60]You can't leave now.
[89:57.78]You can't leave.
[90:06.23]I just silly puttied that guy's back.
[90:12.11]Shit!
[90:12.77]When I told him to break a leg before the game, I didn't...
[90:27.89]Look at me!
[90:31.97]This is embarrassing.
[90:33.04]58 to 12.
[90:33.26]Who fucking cares?
[90:58.05]Oh, I was trying to be, like, I was trying to BM their team.
[91:02.27]Yeah, how about this for the ultimate BM?
[91:06.27]No, he's still, still okay.
[91:09.59]Alright, let me BM their quarterback.
[91:27.87]Eh, whatever.
[91:28.41]Let him have it.
[91:29.09]You got a touchdown.
[91:30.51]Congratulations.
[91:32.45]Oh, no.
[91:32.63]I'm going to make so much money.
[91:34.55]$128,000.
[91:34.57]$45,000.
[91:34.59]$36,000.
[91:34.61]Oh, wow.
[91:34.83]Look at that. $433,000.
[92:02.66]Now let's go see how the halfback is doing.
[92:09.34]Also, uh, 25 minutes ago or so, Great Canadian Fuck Club gave, uh, I think eight community subs here.
[92:19.27]Thank you, Great Canadian.
[92:22.79]Lifestyle.
[92:24.53]Girlfriends.
[92:26.45]Tarot.
[92:30.17]Okay.
[92:32.09]You can get almost any type of juice at discounted rates.
[92:35.87]Do I even have any sponsors anymore?
[92:39.05]I guess so.
[92:43.73]Alright, let's go to injuries.
[92:47.02]Six games.
[92:50.80]One game.
[92:51.26]That's fine.
[92:54.78]Here's a problem, though.
[92:56.71]This is my backup halfback.
[92:58.41]This is my main halfback.
[93:02.24]I got... I got the third replacement here.
[93:05.90]I got the second backup in the game.
[93:14.57]That's not good.
[93:16.35]All those halfback plays I'm gonna have to slow down on.
[93:20.65]What do you think?
[93:21.13]Hands, maybe?
[93:22.81]Block?
[93:26.23]Yeah, we need better blocks.
[93:28.43]Either that or a better break tackle.
[93:35.45]Resist Injury.
[93:36.19]Yeah, that's another good one.
[93:38.05]Yeah.
[93:39.35]It's important.
[93:40.77]And then Block.
[93:46.07]53 grand.
[93:46.39]Let's take a look at Juicing.
[93:47.41]What have we got?
[93:48.53]Team Risk is still pretty damn high.
[93:50.09]Just take the ones that you know.
[93:53.04]Hey, look!
[93:53.34]This guy, like, Baxter!
[94:03.46]It's legal.
[94:04.08]Don't worry.
[94:08.86]So 4-0.
[94:10.54]Wins to Advance won.
[94:12.78]So I just have to win one more game.
[94:15.74]And I'm guaranteed to be able to play to Advance.
[94:19.04]4-0.
[94:27.04]Chicago Marauders are the next team.
[94:35.13]So there's three more games.
[94:36.87]I just gotta win one more of these games.
[94:39.90]Shouldn't be too big of a problem.
[94:41.82]Let's go.
[94:45.20]Defense got better.
[94:50.24]No, no, that's... Oh, that's us.
[94:51.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[94:54.58]I'm 4-0.
[94:54.82]I got a better team.
[94:55.60]More than 23 points.
[94:57.74]I'll put 10 grand on it.
[95:03.91]I already played, I think, the best team in the division.
[95:07.47]Max bet?
[95:07.99]Sure.
[95:09.84]We're taking on the Chicago Marauders.
[95:12.54]Quarterback Shane Spain is a gladiator in the Windy City.
[95:16.50]18 years in the league and still battling.
[95:19.02]Spain may not scramble like you, but there's no one stronger in the pocket.
[95:23.94]Just make sure you get to him before he makes the throw.
[95:28.03]Otherwise, he'll hack your heart out.
[95:30.47]A lot of quarterbacks as captains in this division.
[95:39.87]We're gonna have to take care of him.
[95:47.88]That guy's form is really bad.
[95:53.04]Yeah, that guy has the same amount of skill and form that I do when I go to the driving range.
[95:59.25]How many guys play golf?
[96:01.25]How many guys don't play golf and just go and swing away at the driving range?
[96:05.89]I used to all the time and it was so much fun.
[96:09.53]Good evening, everyone.
[96:10.64]The Division 2 campaign is well underway, and most people around this team are feeling good about their chances going forward.
[96:17.02]And now, let's get ready for the kickoff.
[96:23.04]Haven't in a long time.
[96:23.91]Nobody plays golf with it, but people still go to the range.
[96:30.91]And... Please.
[96:33.05]Thank you, Sans.
[96:46.42]Already chanting bullshit.
[96:48.12]That was the kickoff return.
[96:54.36]Fuck.
[96:58.57]That's... Good, good, good, good, good.
[97:00.45]No, no, no.
[97:01.09]They're gonna break.
[97:03.31]We'll be back in like two plays.
[97:08.01]Four plays.
[97:11.77]Always goes for the ass.
[97:13.91]Guys.
[97:14.13]Can somebody tackle him?
[97:15.34]That was almost the whole team.
[97:17.00]Blitz.
[97:19.70]He's my guy.
[97:43.80]Shit it's okay Whole team can stop one guy usually how it works, right?
[98:01.27]Max bet don't worry Shit
[98:12.29]Alright, I got the ball.
[98:14.26]We're gonna go disaster right at the middle.
[98:26.79]No, what?
[98:27.85]What are you doing?
[98:31.37]Why?
[98:32.55]Ugh.
[98:34.13]Not good.
[98:34.67]This is not good.
[98:40.32]Well, this is not good.
[98:47.70]Whose head is this?
[98:49.49]I bumped my head on him and he broke it.
[98:51.93]And he's still up!
[98:53.47]Oh my god!
[98:54.97]Why?
[98:55.93]What the fuck?
[98:58.12]Why are they... Why are they so good?
[99:10.62]They're on a bunch of drugs, they have to be.
[99:13.94]Well... And I don't have my good halfback... Okay, I keep forgetting.
[99:24.17]Don't do any plays that require the halfback to run.
[99:27.59]That is the second replacement halfback.
[99:30.75]Why would I do that?
[99:31.43]Man, he got destroyed.
[99:45.06]So if I don't have any halfbacks, who is the halfback?
[99:52.66]Alright, come on.
[99:55.96]Nope.
[100:01.71]That's why I was hugging the right side.
[100:03.61]First down.
[100:04.19]30 yards to go.
[100:13.07]Alright, here we go.
[100:14.41]I can come back.
[100:18.79]Just play smart.
[100:20.87]Don't do anything fancy.
[100:21.87]Just do smart plays.
[100:25.59]I'm gonna drag across.
[100:28.57]See if we can get the guy across.
[100:35.12]Bingo.
[100:35.52]Got it.
[100:36.92]Just fucking play smart.
[100:37.74]I just gotta get a few more yards.
[100:40.44]Third and nine.
[100:45.13]Fuck it.
[100:51.99]Down, down yourself, down yourself.
[100:59.15]Slowly but surely.
[100:59.88]End of the quarter.
[101:03.72]And that's the end of the first quarter as Chicago leads by 13.
[101:07.04]He's getting nervous.
[101:10.32]Yeah, when you're down by 13, you gotta... Of course I'm gonna be nervous.
[101:15.36]Let's go with lightning.
[101:16.06]Sir, don't let him catch that.
[101:19.37]Let's try this one.
[101:42.27]That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.
[101:46.31]Fucking halfback.
[101:50.72]No, I can't do any halfback plays.
[101:52.92]He's so bad.
[102:01.88]Looking for the big play.
[102:04.55]Get out of my life!
[102:05.52]Ooh!
[102:07.74]Beer chuck!
[102:08.56]Right?
[102:08.94]I don't know.
[102:09.76]How's the halfback gonna get better if you don't use him?
[102:12.44]He's not even supposed to be in the game.
[102:14.16]I need this.
[102:50.73]Get a fumble.
[102:51.21]Look at how hurt he is.
[102:53.41]Fumble.
[102:54.83]Strip it.
[102:56.54]This guy's at 48%.
[102:58.36]How the hell are you holding onto the ball?
[102:59.82]48%.
[103:01.40]And he got unleashed.
[103:20.71]Nobody can hold on to that.
[103:21.59]I'm not sure there's anybody on Earth.
[103:30.26]Who got the ball at the... Thank you.
[103:35.93]Somebody came across and made it happen.
[103:38.83]3rd and 19.
[103:39.23]Cover.
[103:39.47]I'm going to just lock it down.
[103:43.67]I'm going to hang out back here.
[103:45.08]They're going to punt it.
[103:52.32]See you later.
[103:54.42]I can't late hit him?
[103:56.96]Punt.
[103:59.86]Good.
[104:07.93]Well, Bryant's not looking so good.
[104:15.27]Oh, that was embarrassing.
[104:20.80]It's okay.
[104:23.68]Let's try this one.
[104:26.00]Wide receiver.
[104:26.60]They got a lot of... Let's go right side then.
[104:31.30]Bingo.
[104:38.33]Who gets the ball to half?
[104:39.15]Me?
[104:42.23]Hurry up.
[104:42.59]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[104:48.25]And that's first down yardage right there.
[104:54.41]Power wide is this going to the halfback?
[104:58.91]Alright time to shine halfback Come on Baxter Baxter, I love you Oh
[105:27.04]Okay.
[105:28.34]I'm just going to go for a tie game.
[105:33.98]The chug joke is getting old.
[105:35.30]It's not a joke.
[105:36.82]It's just in the three seconds that I have to do that, it's the only one that I've completely memorized.
[105:40.62]Totally.
[105:52.90]Why does he keep doing the same shit?
[105:54.34]Alright.
[105:54.66]Time for an injury.
[106:15.60]How are you back in two plays?
[106:21.40]I don't know how that's possible, but OK.
[106:27.61]Shattered bones.
[106:29.03]Where are you going?
[106:29.57]Where are you going?
[106:31.17]The ball comes loose.
[106:32.36]Give me a touchdown right now.
[106:34.83]Oh, get out of my fucking face.
[106:36.39]No, why did you run outside?
[106:38.15]Oh, I'm so annoyed by that.
[106:41.13]Why did you go outside?
[106:44.66]Unbelievable.
[106:46.40]That sucks.
[106:50.96]He drop kicked him in the face and ended up running outside on his own.
[106:53.90]I didn't do that.
[106:59.76]It's because I did the dropkick.
[107:02.06]I'm very, very upset about that.
[107:10.97]Fucking asshole.
[107:15.55]Oh.
[107:16.39]God damn it.
[107:20.07]The game hates me.
[107:21.69]I had an opportunity to be up, and now, like, a fucking interception.
[107:28.37]Because I kicked a guy in the face and jumped out of bounds.
[107:35.32]Fuck you.
[107:49.46]Recovered from a broken forearm.
[107:51.01]There's a lot of drugs involved, guys.
[107:52.41]I thought I had it.
[107:59.66]You don't catch that.
[108:01.40]It's impossible.
[108:02.66]You both are putting your hands in the air.
[108:04.56]Stop it.
[108:10.13]Block this.
[108:28.60]We got a game now.
[108:31.12]It's been a while.
[108:31.84]It's been at least two or three games since we've had a game.
[108:45.55]Oh, their defense is so good for some reason.
[108:51.85]And they have a fucking Unleashed.
[109:01.14]I gotta... Watch this shit.
[109:05.50]Oops-a-daisy!
[109:06.28]This is bad.
[109:06.76]Hahaha.
[109:30.09]Fucking Sullivan has to be hurt again.
[109:33.78]Just fucking... That was so stupid.
[109:37.30]I don't deserve it, but I'll take it.
[109:44.65]That's fine with me.
[110:06.30]You know, I talked a lot of shit about Baxter, but he really is the only person that... What's the code?
[110:25.65]Triangle... Three triangles and one X. Triangle, square, X, O. Triangle, square, X, O?
[110:40.53]Triangle square X-O.
[110:42.43]That's what somebody said.
[110:45.65]One guy did say that, you're right.
[110:53.00]Triangle square X-O.
[111:01.69]Is that the joke that it stuck to me?
[111:15.06]We're good at gaming.
[111:17.70]The touchdown codes are in the menu.
[111:19.39]Yeah, I only have four of them.
[111:22.73]I don't think you can do any of them unless they're here, because we tried them before.
[111:27.93]Beer Shark really is the best one out of these four.
[111:29.87]There's only four codes.
[111:42.92]You have to unlock them.
[111:44.59]That's what I figured.
[111:45.23]Looks like it's going to be beer chug.
[111:49.70]Don't hurt him.
[111:51.68]Not good.
[111:56.04]Drop that bolt.
[112:01.62]Bumble.
[112:02.60]Oh, I'm sorry.
[112:05.46]Yeah, no, he's out of it.
[112:06.62]We got to get him out of here.
[112:07.36]Yeah, I don't want to move him.
[112:08.96]I'm going to call a cart.
[112:10.42]Okay.
[112:12.22]Yeah, get it out here.
[112:15.13]Ruined that guy's life First down and 30 we're in blitz.
[112:20.61]We're in the blitz league.
[112:21.81]That's like Just give me one second here At least he's gone for a few games instead of a few plays.
[112:26.97]Yeah, that's true.
[112:28.31]I
[112:44.66]Was it third down?
[112:45.74]Second down.
[112:46.20]Second and 17th.
[112:52.94]Not gonna happen.
[112:54.64]Third down.
[112:59.11]Got an unleash.
[112:59.97]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[113:01.81]It's 20-20.
[113:04.65]Stay.
[113:04.89]Let's go.
[113:05.27]Just deep zones.
[113:07.08]Quarterback passes all the damn time.
[113:09.00]Just gonna block it.
[113:15.42]I can't fucking believe that just happens.
[113:20.62]What happened here?
[113:22.71]I was ready for him right here.
[113:31.22]Okay, he hit... Here's the chain of events here.
[113:34.44]This guy doesn't tackle.
[113:35.92]Instead, I come across with franchise.
[113:37.86]Try to do the tackle.
[113:38.64]Don't get it.
[113:39.18]This guy tackles franchise.
[113:41.50]And that guy fell down because I grabbed his toe.
[113:43.82]Great.
[113:45.06]Good work, guys.
[113:47.68]As we reach the end of the third quarter, we're tied.
[113:57.01]Mmm...
[113:59.56]I don't want to use the unleash, though.
[114:07.33]Make him kick a field goal, and then I can use the unleash to get a touchdown.
[114:10.83]Don't let him get it.
[114:21.82]No unleash, not necessary.
[114:23.18]Don't do it.
[114:33.89]Use Unleash to defend.
[114:34.84]I don't think I need to right now.
[114:38.30]See you later.
[114:41.90]That's the quarterback.
[114:42.52]Oh, Brake is back.
[114:51.01]Best thing that could have happened.
[114:55.77]Get that backup quarterback in here.
[114:57.47]Fourth goal.
[114:57.85]Are they going for a field goal?
[114:59.63]I don't know.
[114:59.93]What are they doing?
[115:01.91]They're going for a field goal.
[115:04.72]Block it.
[115:09.48]Don't go.
[115:09.82]No go.
[115:10.08]No good.
[115:12.34]No, it wasn't.
[115:15.20]It bounced off the middle.
[115:16.22]What?
[115:21.73]Oh, it bounced in.
[115:27.65]Touchdown wins the game.
[115:39.04]Alright.
[115:40.24]I got a false set of downs here to get at least a field goal.
[115:43.70]Rip the bet.
[115:44.70]Yeah, it's alright.
[115:51.10]I need to win the game.
[115:52.22]How many yards is that?
[115:57.39]Eight?
[115:57.99]Not very much.
[116:06.49]Wide open.
[116:07.71]Why would you jump and land on your back?
[116:11.01]What did you do that for?
[116:13.95]Why would you do that?
[116:15.49]Catch it and turn around!
[116:16.51]I didn't need to use timeout, but I panicked.
[116:28.60]I just did.
[116:39.44]I gotta play defense.
[116:40.80]That should be the game.
[116:42.02]Field goal won't win it.
[116:46.02]Just don't get this blocked.
[117:11.81]Defense.
[117:20.85]They don't... I don't... They have no unleash.
[117:23.37]Just play smart.
[117:24.89]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[117:29.66]You've got to be kidding me!
[117:31.94]No!
[117:32.40]Somebody get him!
[117:45.63]I can't believe it.
[117:49.75]It's a fake!
[117:53.79]Okay, alright, alright.
[117:54.75]27, wait, I need a field goal.
[118:02.75]Field goal is all I need.
[118:04.73]Just get there.
[118:05.45]No, run it back for a fucking touchdown right now.
[118:10.98]Get into field goal range!
[118:11.84]Am I in field goal range?
[118:17.88]I'm so fucked, my heart is just pounding right now.
[118:20.04]What the hell?
[118:20.72]I have one timeout.
[118:24.51]Oh, come on.
[118:25.87]I'm just panicking!
[118:34.15]I gotta kick a field goal.
[118:35.23]Fuck!
[118:39.38]How far am I away?
[118:40.46]I'm fucked.
[118:51.23]Let's go.
[118:51.59]And as time expires, Chicago wins the game.
[119:34.44]I shouldn't have lost that fucking game.
[119:36.40]The run back for a touchdown just gets slippery bullshit.
[119:41.66]I make like two tackles and he just bribes it.
[119:44.06]Fuck off, alright?
[119:44.96]I'm nine and two right now, agent.
[119:47.74]Franchise, you ready to step it up this Sunday?
[119:50.12]Julius Williams is the league's number one cash cow.
[119:53.33]He's got every major sponsor kissing his ass.
[119:56.81]If you can shut Williams down, we're going to attract all the right kind of attention.
[120:00.55]I'm so mad right now.
[120:02.09]Fucking hell.
[120:07.54]Miami Hammerheads, I'm so unreasonably upset.
[120:11.80]Yeah, alright, injuries.
[120:13.21]Finally, I get my halfback, who is one of the best halfbacks in the league.
[120:18.53]And he's in the game.
[120:19.95]I wonder if I'll have him for one game, and then he'll break a bone and be gone for two games.
[120:29.87]Baxter is Greg Dalton.
[120:31.03]Fuck Baxter.
[120:38.05]Go back to experimenting on flies in the Ninja Turtles.
[120:50.15]I don't think I can do anything.
[120:51.65]211.
[120:51.95]No, fuck you, Jerva.
[121:00.97]No, I'm kidding.
[121:01.71]Baxter was the only one that did anything.
[121:04.02]But...
[121:05.97]I can't believe they ran it back for a touchdown.
[121:07.93]I can't believe it.
[121:09.84]All I had to do was just tackle and they broke every tackle.
[121:18.40]Why is the team risk always so high?
[121:19.78]Why not screw it?
[121:25.74]Ball carrier gets a clash icon for every 30 yards gained in a play.
[121:31.87]That's actually kind of insane.
[121:32.81]I don't give a shit.
[121:34.87]Send me to jail.
[121:45.91]Miami Hammerheads.
[121:46.69]They're a good team too.
[121:54.21]Same record.
[121:58.93]That was such a hard one to swallow.
[122:00.63]It's alright.
[122:01.17]I'm still one of the best teams in the league.
[122:04.33]Miami Hammerheads.
[122:04.94]Let's go.
[122:06.09]The Hammerheads used to be a team going nowhere.
[122:08.73]Now they're on everyone's radar.
[122:10.37]Their fortunes change when they move from Orlando to Miami and acquire quarterback Julius Williams.
[122:15.45]Williams has the biggest salary in the league, and his precision guided attack is worth every penny.
[122:20.20]Too bad he's so expensive they can't afford to repair the hurricane damage to the stadium.
[122:25.22]Why are they dropping?
[122:26.02]When he's not bombing defenses through the air, he's burning them up on the ground.
[122:29.68]Look at the stadium.
[122:32.72]He's too much money.
[122:34.93]So they can't repair the stadium.
[122:41.13]That's really fucking ridiculous.
[122:45.01]The stadium is in complete disarray and they don't have the money to repair it.
[122:59.80]Bad in the trenches, and they have a good spread offense.
[123:09.04]Gotta hold Williamston to 200 yards.
[123:15.17]Good luck.
[123:15.75]It's alright.
[123:16.47]We're in the home game.
[123:21.57]Started off good.
[123:23.74]That's a good fucking way to start it, I would say.
[123:25.94]With a touchdown.
[123:27.36]With a touchdown, I would say.
[123:29.48]With a touchdown, I would say.
[123:31.02]Oh.
[123:38.41]Got the halfback as well.
[123:40.21]Damn it.
[123:40.47]Sorry.
[123:40.59]Asshole.
[123:54.47]Let's go with Volt.
[123:55.27]Tight end Volt.
[124:03.79]Nice job.
[124:05.07]Nice job, Schlosser, or whatever his name is.
[124:08.13]First touchdown of the game.
[124:18.98]We just had 5,000 bits just came in.
[124:20.98]50 bucks.
[124:23.46]from Lakronda.
[124:24.22]Thank you, Lakronda, for the fifty five zero zero zero five thousand bits.
[124:31.21]And you say... What do you say?
[124:32.99]Let's see.
[124:34.05]Hey, Jeremy, it's clear what you have to do.
[124:35.39]Just run the ball all the way to the right and get a touchdown.
[124:37.99]It's just that easy.
[124:41.61]You mean like this guy's doing right now.
[124:43.19]Like he's going left.
[124:48.85]Thank you so much, Lakronda.
[124:50.43]It's a lot of money.
[124:52.23]And I already got an Unleashed.
[124:53.17]Let's see if we can get a Bumble right now.
[124:54.90]Let's just go with an all-out Blitz.
[124:58.48]We're talking, like, literal all-out just Blitz.
[125:00.90]Everybody on the team.
[125:02.62]Get everyone over here.
[125:08.46]Choke Slam.
[125:12.01]Oh, that was really cool that he didn't drop it.
[125:20.15]They've got a long way to go.
[125:20.83]Let's just do some kind of a waste of a little unleash, unfortunately.
[125:26.93]What are you throwing?
[125:28.95]Fucking asshole.
[125:30.15]I didn't have any meter.
[125:32.62]I burnt the meter.
[125:33.28]What the hell were you doing?
[125:49.11]I got absolutely... I got no meter at all.
[125:54.45]I'm gonna get a dirty hit.
[125:55.25]I thought he was gonna throw it.
[126:01.84]I was waiting for it.
[126:02.48]Let's bomb edge it.
[126:18.50]Nothing.
[126:18.96]Fourth down.
[126:20.84]Good luck.
[126:21.30]Get a field goal, dude.
[126:22.56]Hold him to a field goal.
[126:26.46]I'll be happy.
[126:38.95]The field goal is good.
[126:43.11]The Super Bowlers sure are good.
[126:50.49]What are they chanting?
[126:53.17]Are they saying Yankees suck?
[126:56.38]Why would they be doing that?
[127:04.10]Who's injured?
[127:04.86]Shoulder dislocation.
[127:13.68]Oh!
[127:26.86]Slippery hands.
[127:29.48]Slippery.
[127:30.06]He's gone.
[127:30.74]It's alright.
[127:34.26]Slippery fucking fingers.
[127:35.29]It's OK.
[127:35.59]It's like quadruple coverage.
[127:41.65]He's still gone.
[127:42.21]Let's do a run this way with the halfback.
[128:04.69]I juked that one.
[128:05.53]Minecraft Steve?
[128:06.11]It is kind of Minecraft Steve.
[128:06.77]Yeah, that was a good, that was a good play.
[128:07.98]See, this is why we need Sullivan.
[128:08.84]Because if that was Baxter, he probably would have fallen down.
[128:34.14]Baxter doesn't make that play.
[128:35.83]We don't get that touchdown.
[128:45.21]Bumble.
[128:46.91]Yup.
[128:48.15]Ooh, this is good.
[128:51.98]Did I max bet?
[128:55.00]I don't think I max bet, did I?
[128:56.94]First and goal.
[128:57.80]It's gut check time.
[128:59.26]Ball at about the 21-yard line.
[129:05.08]Touchdown.
[129:06.04]Just right up the middle.
[129:08.16]Just jump over the edge.
[129:14.18]Did I bet, though?
[129:14.68]I don't remember.
[129:15.40]I hate to say it, but I've been wanting to hit him like that since the beginning of K.
[129:34.57]Field goal.
[129:34.97]We'll kick it.
[129:36.40]I didn't bet at all.
[129:37.34]Oh well.
[129:42.80]Don't get comfortable though.
[129:45.57]This team is really good.
[129:50.25]It's like the only other 4-1 team in the league.
[130:17.57]Unleash is back.
[130:18.29]Good.
[130:20.93]Standard cover play.
[130:22.15]I think that sounds good to me.
[130:26.54]Oh, he's gonna throw it.
[130:27.06]No, he's not.
[130:30.30]Oh, unbelievable!
[130:32.02]Unbelievable!
[130:40.28]Same thing.
[130:40.84]Do it again.
[130:51.53]See ya.
[130:52.29]Alright.
[130:54.24]Play smart.
[130:54.84]That's all I gotta do.
[131:10.56]This will take me to the championship.
[131:14.60]Shit, Miami sucks.
[131:15.80]But they don't!
[131:18.22]They're 4-1, just like me.
[131:22.76]Just getting good turnovers.
[131:26.36]And yeah, we have Sullivan.
[131:27.44]It's a completely different team, like somebody just said.
[131:31.31]This is one of the best players on the team and in the league.
[131:34.53]And they've been absent.
[131:39.46]If Sullivan is on the team, we win by 40 points.
[131:45.49]That's just how it works.
[131:47.01]I'm on easy difficulty?
[131:56.27]I don't think... Is there even a difficulty slider in this game?
[131:58.58]I don't think there is.
[131:59.18]I haven't used it.
[132:00.28]This is just the campaign.
[132:05.91]Las Vegas has been playing stingy defense against the run.
[132:08.99]They mean business out there.
[132:11.67]Yeah, it's on easy?
[132:13.49]What?
[132:20.60]There is no difficulty.
[132:24.98]Easy.
[132:29.52]Turn the music on?
[132:30.24]I can't.
[132:30.58]The whole stream will be muted.
[132:32.90]It is just constant 100% copyright and music the whole game.
[132:36.95]So no one will be able to watch your vlog.
[132:48.02]That's fourth down.
[132:49.26]And they got two seconds, five seconds.
[132:52.72]You have to go for it, right?
[132:55.77]Yeah.
[132:57.67]Get back here.
[133:05.38]Oh!
[133:05.82]He's going to make it.
[133:11.15]He made it.
[133:13.85]Oh, why did I let that happen?
[133:15.41]It's because I punt.
[133:17.91]Why did I do punt return?
[133:19.85]Oh my fucking god.
[133:21.95]Punt return.
[133:22.87]Great job.
[133:23.49]Yeah.
[133:23.89]There's like five seconds fucking left.
[133:31.57]The conversion is good.
[133:35.50]And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 17.
[133:38.72]It's okay.
[133:44.94]Fuck me.
[133:45.53]Why do I always let the most bogus shit happen?
[133:50.73]With five seconds left, I already run the whole field.
[133:53.89]Just fucking kill this guy.
[134:02.98]Like, I will beat this guy in a football match.
[134:22.61]But you give somebody a chance to, like, fucking throw up down the field and, like, run by everybody with two seconds left, it'll happen every time.
[134:40.07]That was like fucking quadruple cover.
[134:43.57]Nobody got that.
[134:44.21]Motherfucker.
[134:45.45]I don't even need her either.
[134:47.87]Alright.
[134:48.31]That's why I said you can't get comfortable.
[134:49.49]It's a 4-1 team.
[134:50.29]Let's go.
[135:05.40]Can't get comfy.
[135:08.06]Play smart.
[135:10.56]See?
[135:10.92]Just playing by not going for anything crazy.
[135:22.13]Fucking murder him.
[135:25.15]I'm... I'm trying to play smart.
[135:27.59]I'm trying to build meter.
[135:33.19]Fourth down.
[135:34.29]See?
[135:34.43]They didn't get shit.
[135:42.79]Now, are you going to go for it?
[135:45.39]They are.
[135:45.71]They're going for it on fourth down.
[135:46.79]Turnover on downs.
[135:47.77]Exactly what I needed to have happen.
[135:50.80]Let's just go with some short passes.
[136:11.31]NV coach.
[136:12.15]What's wrong with the Nevada coach?
[136:20.56]That was a little bit of game.
[136:27.22]Just a little bit.
[136:29.56]I'm going to run it.
[136:30.14]I got the halfback situation right here.
[136:31.64]Float left.
[136:32.92]I got a little bit of meter.
[136:34.12]Let's go.
[136:40.46]Go.
[136:41.36]Right up the middle.
[136:42.10]Straight through.
[136:42.48]Just run.
[136:47.33]QB dash.
[136:47.95]Just walk over the line.
[137:01.39]Don't want to get tackled though.
[137:02.71]Holotex has a broken skull and I have to delete the game.
[137:04.81]Really?
[137:05.03]Alright, I gotta unleash this.
[137:05.85]I'm going for an actual unleash.
[137:32.06]Turbo Boomer activated.
[137:34.46]What does that mean?
[138:19.27]Now I can relax I'm up by way too much Las Vegas refuses to call off the dogs as they add to their lead Insult, let's insult them
[138:41.07]43-11.
[138:43.23]Where was this yesterday?
[138:46.15]And by yesterday, I mean in the video game.
[138:50.79]I couldn't do anything.
[138:51.84]Couldn't get a fumble, couldn't get a turnover.
[139:03.89]Good thing there's no injury there.
[139:07.75]What difficulty am I playing on?
[139:09.43]There is no difficulty.
[139:10.45]I don't know.
[139:11.41]Normal?
[139:12.77]Regular?
[139:22.50]Watch this.
[139:22.92]I just want everyone to be aware of this.
[139:27.56]One, two, three, four people here.
[139:31.89]And we synchronized swim.
[139:35.39]And he caught the ball.
[139:45.05]punch somebody swam a word yeah swam I swam there you didn't you it's you swam that's word

[140:20.04]I swa- what is it?
[140:21.28]Swan?
[140:23.10]I swoomed.
[140:24.53]I swam there.
[140:27.61]No, it's not swummed.
[140:29.23]It's swam.
[140:33.69]Swimmed?
[140:34.29]Now you're just fucking around.
[140:47.26]Okay, no, I got let's burn the clock Swim swum
[141:21.57]Anybody that joins the stream right now and looks at chat are probably going to be like, is this like a funny in-joke that this guy has in his stream?
[141:29.25]Well, the only thing I can figure is that the quarterback must have thought it was opposite day.
[141:37.95]Now people say, sorry, I guess today must be opposite day when they screw up.
[141:41.36]But for it really to be opposite day, wouldn't it have to be night?
[141:47.39]Injury.
[141:48.13]Nope.
[141:48.51]That's a pretty good point.
[141:49.37]That's pretty much what we just heard.
[141:51.59]Smart announcer.
[142:12.57]Do I have that in Izzup yet?
[142:15.03]Kind of is.
[142:16.01]In a way.
[142:16.33]That's not a safety?
[142:17.27]Alright, this is the opportunity if I'm gonna hurt someone.
[142:34.85]I don't even care if they score a touchdown.
[142:36.35]Who cares?
[142:36.67]We're going to go special teams and field goal block.
[142:40.39]Got it.
[142:41.19]That's it.
[142:41.65]I'll take the ball.
[142:42.77]Well, that's a good achievement for that somehow.
[143:08.06]oh well 45 17 I'll take the win now we qualify for the division two championship moving on to the championship game I don't think he got 200 yards did he should have wagered safety dance new trophy
[143:40.28]Yeah, the second Super Bowl.
[143:42.58]Division II Super Bowl.
[143:44.78]Well, not yet.
[143:46.28]There's still one more game in the division.
[143:48.72]Uh, sabotaging the other team?
[144:11.04]Yeah, I think so.
[144:11.88]That's a good idea.
[144:12.54]Do it.
[144:12.80]National ad campaign.
[144:13.46]So what does that mean?
[144:16.62]Play next game at Las Vegas Aces.
[144:17.96]So with...
[144:39.01]The Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas Super Bowls.
[144:45.68]Who's the real Vegas team?
[144:49.04]I was going to name my team the Las Vegas Aces, do you remember?
[144:55.74]It was gonna be the Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas Aces.
[144:59.86]That's too bad.
[145:02.94]So, we'll find out who the best team in Vegas is.
[145:06.44]But first...
[145:08.94]uh okay let's go to upgrades agility get everything to agility juicing Mr. super bowl we're going to give you something good successful clash moves drain clash from opponent's clash bar that's pretty good
[145:37.81]Regenerate two stamina each play you're on the field.
[145:39.75]He's on every play.
[145:40.81]Let's give Sullivan something.
[145:47.33]Turbo bar drains 50% slower.
[145:49.37]Yeah, I think so.
[145:51.61]Somebody on defense, too.
[145:54.40]Jake Cruz.
[145:54.86]Give you something easy.
[146:09.66]Training is fine.
[146:10.82]Everything looks alright.
[146:11.70]Alright.
[146:14.85]Here we go.
[146:15.23]Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas Super Bowls.
[146:20.51]Good luck.
[146:24.23]They're not a bad team.
[146:27.00]I do have to max bet on the Las Vegas game, though.
[146:31.50]Why wouldn't I do that?
[146:32.18]5-1, 3-3.
[146:33.16]They're not a bad team.
[146:33.86]Let's go.
[146:37.66]Okay.
[146:38.92]Where are we playing?
[146:40.08]Are we playing in...
[147:05.65]my Vegas stadium or their Vegas stadium both at the same time you share one that's a cool logo good evening and welcome
[147:35.05]Take a look at that crowd.
[147:37.19]You can see who they really support in that audience.
[147:42.83]We're on their home turf.
[147:44.98]And they are wearing my colors.
[147:46.42]Look at that.
[147:48.36]People's champion right here.
[147:49.70]Absolutely.
[147:51.90]That's not good.
[147:55.90]That's a fumble.
[147:56.60]No, it's not.
[148:10.59]If it's Las Vegas versus Las Vegas, who is it an away game for?
[148:15.31]I don't know.
[148:19.13]Apparently me.
[148:27.14]Damn it.
[148:27.74]Fumble out of bounds.
[148:33.68]Alright, take it seriously.
[148:34.64]This is a good team.
[148:36.13]Even though I already clinched the playoffs, it's fine.
[148:44.64]Okay, goal.
[148:55.20]No, bounce.
[148:55.94]Bounce deep.
[148:57.42]Third and seven.
[149:03.51]How much time you gonna give him?
[149:06.21]Oh boy!
[149:06.97]Oh shit!
[149:15.45]Let's do a trick play here.
[149:16.51]Maniac.
[149:16.79]I couldn't get rid of it.
[149:17.63]I was going to circle.
[149:18.17]Fuck.
[149:42.25]I tricked myself.
[149:43.69]Third and 33.
[149:44.13]This is long.
[149:44.48]Holy fucking triangle!
[149:44.98]See you later.
[149:45.26]Sullivan's got it.
[149:45.76]Touchdown.
[149:48.32]Touchdown!
[150:16.08]This is the last game of the season.
[150:19.48]This is just a fun game.
[150:20.82]Because it doesn't matter if I win or lose.
[150:29.55]I already clinched playoffs.
[150:36.43]That would have been embarrassing.
[150:38.23]It's all good.
[150:43.72]$25,000 bet.
[150:43.96]I needed to win by, what was it?
[150:46.52]$17,000?
[150:46.54]$18,000?
[150:46.60]Let's go for the head.
[151:03.05]Drop of the ball.
[151:04.11]Nice.
[151:08.95]Wide receiver.
[151:09.74]That's pretty good.
[151:16.01]This is the championship?
[151:17.83]This might be the local championship.
[151:22.85]Incomplete.
[151:23.71]The quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets good before the defender, I think.
[151:27.13]This is Vegas, Vegas.
[151:29.23]They ain't going to go anywhere.
[151:34.65]Wow, that was a fierce collision.
[151:49.97]It's the Vegas Bowl.
[151:54.20]Two Vegas teams in the same division.
[152:01.04]Hold him here.
[152:03.38]Should be able to do it.
[152:08.62]That was a trick play.
[152:09.89]Franchise performs 30 or more dirty hits.
[152:11.85]What was that?
[152:14.49]I didn't even see what that said.
[152:15.97]And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by seven.
[152:22.83]But which Las Vegas?
[152:24.25]Fourth and 16, they're going to punt it.
[152:43.13]I got to stop jumping.
[152:46.91]If you jump in the area and get tackled, you have a much higher percentage chance to get hurt or drop the ball.
[152:54.37]And though it does work sometimes.
[152:56.33]They've seen me jump over tackles before.
[153:02.73]Who is it?
[153:07.28]Drop it!
[153:14.38]Give me this back.
[153:19.28]Ah, that sucks.
[153:28.43]Broken humorous.
[153:35.13]Here we go again.
[153:36.47]I get the ball at the half, so... They do all these weird... What the fuck was that?
[153:43.66]Why did he just fall on his back?
[153:57.32]Whatever.
[153:57.70]I got meter, I'll probably use it.
[154:00.12]Goodbye.
[154:20.08]Quarterback is gone.
[154:21.78]Two plays.
[154:22.26]What if it happened to, like, the skull contusions?
[154:25.00]Got him.
[154:47.64]Second pick off, really?
[154:52.09]Is this a wrestling game?
[154:53.03]It's whatever you want it to be.
[155:00.39]You have to stop aiming for their ass.
[155:03.58]It's just so easy to do that, though.
[155:09.58]Fuck it, let's go.
[155:14.71]Thought I could push him.
[155:23.02]Gotta cross.
[155:26.70]God damn it.
[155:30.96]I get the ball in 13 seconds.
[155:34.17]So, here's what we're gonna do.
[155:46.47]I could have kicked the field goal, but I wanted to... Look, this game doesn't matter.
[155:58.58]I can just do whatever I want.
[156:10.83]That's a touchdown.
[156:13.91]Thanks.
[156:19.39]Okay, we're good.
[156:21.75]86 yard return.
[156:22.51]Let's just get in there.
[156:23.53]Red zone.
[156:24.69]Power wide.
[156:29.07]Another leash.
[156:36.94]I'm just gonna kick the field goal.
[156:49.66]I did bet too, right?
[156:51.54]I did a max bet.
[156:53.28]We gotta get that money.
[157:02.69]Let Baxter play?
[157:07.07]Can you even do substitutions in this game?
[157:08.71]I don't think you can.
[157:12.62]If I go up by 30 points, then he'll come in.
[157:24.45]This poor guy.
[157:27.01]Out for one play.
[157:28.58]This guy is made out of clay.
[157:29.64]That's it, he's back.
[157:30.22]Welcome back.
[157:53.43]Sack.
[157:54.31]Oh, there he is.
[157:58.13]No, he had a concussion already, didn't he?
[158:00.63]I'm so confused.
[158:06.62]Oh, and his throwing arm too.
[158:07.94]Two, three plays.
[158:23.15]I'm making a lot of good injury plays and they're not really doing very much.
[158:28.90]Whoops-a-daisy.
[158:29.50]Missed that one.
[158:31.22]This is my opportunity to get the money.
[158:53.45]I hate when that happens.
[158:54.39]It's so stupid.
[158:56.93]Seriously, when it bounces off the fucking ground.
[158:59.21]I need to win by 17 points.
[159:25.32]Uh oh.
[159:26.02]What was it?
[159:26.38]Broken ribs.
[159:27.28]Mims is good.
[159:28.00]Two plays good.
[159:54.29]Out for 200 games.
[159:55.37]Get in there.
[160:00.83]I think I'm going for a QB.
[160:03.37]Walk across the line.
[160:04.27]3, 2, 1, go!
[160:04.67]Seriously.
[160:04.99]Do it again.
[160:06.90]There you go.
[160:07.26]You're alright, buddy.
[160:09.02]Get out there and kick his ass!
[160:25.79]Three, two, one, go.
[160:27.46]Somebody just wrote stop.
[160:29.66]Yeah, that's what Papa likes.
[160:31.70]Whatever they're doing.
[160:55.48]Another unleash meter, and I'm up by 17.
[160:58.64]Triangle, square, X, circle.
[161:08.53]I don't think any of the other codes work, because I have to unlock them.
[161:13.52]His neck, his chest?
[161:14.44]What is this going to be?
[161:26.91]four games sign our Las Vegas to do something here to get their offense in motion he's going long and it's complete at the 45 yard line and they make the attack saw something in the defense and jumped out of the big game sets them up in nice field position and so with three quarters gone leads
[161:55.53]Collarbones are made out of dry spaghetti.
[161:58.67]And it might be second best chat comment of the night behind Taco Bell.
[162:06.34]Did I just... I got baited into tackling the wrong guy.
[162:16.82]Makes the same noise too.
[162:18.84]If you take a handful of like angel hair pasta and crush it, it'll sound like that.
[162:24.70]And it looks like they'll have four more downs to work with.
[162:26.82]The offense is looking good.
[162:28.32]They're driving.
[162:30.72]It's the coach's favorite place on the field, the red zone.
[162:34.15]Shit.
[162:36.65]Tackle incoming.
[162:37.51]One, two, three.
[162:43.33]Ah, I gotta get another touchdown now to get that money.
[162:48.62]They're going for it.
[162:49.36]Good, go for it.
[162:49.98]That means...
[162:53.91]Nope, he ain't gonna get it.
[162:54.65]So that's six.
[162:55.39]I need to get a field goal.
[163:02.72]Um... Why are you so bad at this game?
[163:19.17]I'm nine and two!
[163:22.25]What?
[163:24.61]No, not the same guy!
[163:25.79]Holy shit.
[163:28.95]They just, like, squished me.
[163:33.07]No, no.
[163:38.34]Same guy.
[163:40.40]Uh oh.
[163:43.04]They just put me in a vice and crushed my body.
[163:45.82]Thank god I picked it up so I can get the points.
[163:48.74]He's gone for eight games.
[163:53.17]Don't stumble like that.
[163:54.25]28.
[163:54.27]That's plenty.
[163:54.91]Just try to be... Who cares?
[163:55.85]Rub it in.
[163:56.25]That's two dead players for the Super Bowlers now.
[164:33.66]Late hit.
[164:41.15]Mims is going to have to retire after this one.
[164:42.93]Yeah, there's a lot of broken bones.
[164:47.03]A lot of shattered spleens, unfortunately.
[164:50.65]Watch this.
[164:52.85]I've had it.
[164:59.45]Always go for the head every time.
[165:00.81]Oh, that hurts.
[165:12.48]I've been knocking him up for like one to two plays this whole game.
[165:21.24]I love this game.
[165:29.03]The noises, the sounds, the close-ups.
[165:31.63]Watch this.
[165:32.01]This guy's dead.
[165:32.97]Get up.
[165:37.79]Go ahead.
[165:38.91]Damn it.
[165:40.13]I was hoping for something devastating there.
[165:48.32]With under 30 seconds to play, Las Vegas leads by 22.
[166:00.44]Hey, that's me.
[166:03.14]Now you try to tell me, in the easiest possible language here, how did he not go down from that?
[166:11.27]That's the worst one.
[166:28.64]What happened?
[166:31.70]Right here.
[166:32.34]Guy on the left, I haven't selected.
[166:33.49]Crushed right into his body.
[166:36.07]No.
[166:37.97]I need one point.
[167:06.02]I need one point.
[167:07.30]Just get close enough.
[167:17.81]No, not 28.
[167:19.45]Thank goodness.
[167:21.13]Ugh, every time.
[167:23.43]Good, use your timeouts.
[167:24.97]I'm okay with that.
[167:31.43]Okay, almost there.
[167:36.21]Who needs that when you can just get a fucking touchdown, right?
[167:38.13]Franchise finds the end zone once again.
[168:10.11]Okay, now don't not let them score.
[168:20.90]Let him go.
[168:21.48]Let him run for five seconds.
[168:23.60]Larsen, this is up to you.
[168:24.74]I want this to be over now.
[168:27.96]Shit, they get one play.
[168:32.15]I'm going all the way back here.
[168:34.33]I'll be ready for him.
[168:39.15]Who do we even do that to?
[168:40.37]Game over.
[168:43.32]And I got the bet.
[168:43.94]Pretty good.
[168:44.30]That was a $25,000 bet.
[168:44.86]Time for the Division 2 Championship.
[169:08.61]New sponsor of the Enforcer.
[169:10.89]Dura Shock gloves.
[169:13.61]Cool.
[169:23.08]League MVP.
[169:25.68]How am I not the MVP?
[169:30.89]15 touchdowns.
[169:31.37]How many touchdowns do I have?
[169:33.93]I have like 60 touchdowns.
[169:39.25]That's what I told him.
[169:40.27]Oh, hey, hold that thought.
[169:41.63]This is my boy.
[169:42.65]Franchise.
[169:43.99]My main man.
[169:45.25]One game, buddy.
[169:46.59]One more win, and it's Division 1.
[169:48.91]The big time.
[169:50.03]You get this done, and we're going to have a license to print money.
[169:53.13]Woo!
[169:54.22]Okay.
[169:56.44]Here comes the D2 championship.
[170:00.26]Taro wants to hang out.
[170:03.46]Rough boy.
[170:04.84]Already fighting for a spot in Division 1.
[170:07.78]Just remember what you've got waiting for you if you make it.
[170:12.11]Okay.
[170:12.65]Hey, French.
[170:13.29]Can you believe it?
[170:13.97]The sponsor decided to take a pass on you and went with grace for their ad campaign.
[170:19.15]Don't take it too hard, buddy.
[170:20.91]She's only the hot
[170:23.36]I just hung up on him.
[170:24.40]Okay, let's take a look.
[170:26.22]Sponsors, let's see.
[170:27.02]New gloves, right?
[170:27.94]Plus six hands!
[170:28.76]That's really, really good, actually.
[170:57.91]What's going on with the girlfriend front here?
[170:59.61]Okay.
[171:04.95]Injuries.
[171:05.73]Who is it?
[171:08.06]Seven.
[171:08.42]Gonna have to give a... Game crashed.
[171:16.68]Please tell me it's saved.
[171:25.54]Did you crash or are you just having a little slowdown period here?
[171:40.45]I think it auto-saves.
[171:42.56]So we might have to listen to those phone calls again.
[171:46.34]Okay, well, let's reset it.
[171:52.30]Hold on, let me just...
[171:57.76]Let's try it again.
[172:02.70]Maybe I clicked too fast.
[172:13.13]What does that mean?
[172:29.47]No, we're good.
[172:31.31]It's sort of weird, but whatever.
[172:33.27]Is it yellow?
[172:33.93]No, no, it's not yellow.
[172:43.87]No, we're back.
[172:46.07]Odd.
[172:46.28]Hopefully it saved the game.
[172:50.82]Oh, that means it's an actual full-on crash if it's yellow?
[172:56.69]No, I think it was just a disk read problem.
[173:00.61]Just kind of ran into itself.
[173:03.76]Let's see if that worked.
[173:07.90]That's not the correct image.
[173:16.75]Yeah, we definitely saw that, so it should be fine.
[173:31.02]Powered by Game Spy.
[173:33.16]They don't exist anymore.
[173:34.08]It's been a while since they've existed.
[173:44.39]Is jermaOld enough to be playing this?
[173:46.39]No.
[173:48.21]Alright, wait a minute.
[173:48.73]Let me see.
[173:49.23]Extras.
[173:50.45]Touchdown codes.
[173:51.45]Here we go.
[173:52.49]How do I unlock them?
[173:58.07]yeah I can't do any of these these have to be unlocked so it's either beer chug or uh ball spike knockout continue select yeah super bowls hopefully we don't do the last game again
[174:26.02]There we go.
[174:26.54]Okay.
[174:28.50]Good.
[174:31.10]Okay.
[174:37.75]So I went here to the trainer to go to injuries and we had a problem.
[174:42.71]I want to assign staff here.
[174:44.43]There we go.
[174:47.17]Everybody for the ruptured spleen.
[174:48.72]Let's go to upgrades.
[174:54.43]Passing is definitely... everything will be at two.
[174:58.27]That'll work from there.
[174:59.47]I'm gonna do probably tackle and break tackle after this.
[175:04.86]Points automatically.
[175:08.06]Risk is high, so just do the legal one.
[175:14.90]Let's get on some defense.
[175:17.84]To, uh... J. Cruz.
[175:24.65]Let's give Sullivan some of this as well.
[175:31.79]Alright, so this is the championship with the Miami Hammerheads.
[175:36.16]I think I'll get a piss first.
[175:37.98]It's been a bi-quarterly two hours.
[175:40.56]So it's time for me to pee one more time.
[175:43.66]I'm not drinking any more coffee, so don't worry.
[175:45.62]Be right back.
[177:36.43]Championship game.
[177:38.47]What do you say?
[177:46.10]Did I beat this team last time?
[177:51.02]Overall, they're a little better.
[177:53.10]Not really, though.
[177:53.64]They have a better offense.
[177:57.95]Great Canadian fuck club.
[177:58.83]Thanks for five community subs.
[178:01.17]On top of the nearly ten that you gave earlier.
[178:04.75]Thank you so much.
[178:07.82]for the super subs.
[178:11.81]That's a lot, I'm not betting.
[178:16.25]Let's go.
[178:17.95]D2 championship.
[178:34.07]Jeremy, you may win the Super Bowl, but have you won six?
[178:38.40]I have not.
[178:40.12]I have not won the Super Bowl that many times.
[178:46.52]Good evening, everyone.
[178:47.74]It's the Division II Championship, and we are raring to go.
[178:51.26]Welcome, my friend.
[178:52.64]There we go.
[178:53.02]It's great to be here.
[178:53.74]I mean, there's a lot of other places I could be, but at this point in time, I'm choosing this place.
[178:58.22]I mean, this is going to be unbelievable.
[179:01.06]I think I do well over 30.
[179:03.46]And a thunder and lightning storm, too.
[179:04.78]Right off the bat.
[179:05.92]That was a good hit.
[179:16.38]When he does that John Madden impression, it just sounds like he's about to burp the whole time he's talking.
[179:21.07]He's fighting back burps.
[179:22.17]There's an opportunity.
[179:25.67]Really?
[179:25.99]That was just... He did a really great job there.
[179:34.22]No first down.
[179:45.26]Your offense is the best part.
[179:47.32]I gotta play better defense.
[179:48.50]The quarterback is really good.
[179:49.72]Injure the quarterback.
[179:56.88]No!
[179:58.84]We're good.
[180:02.08]Who is it?
[180:02.42]What do you want?
[180:04.60]Dupreeh.
[180:08.70]It's alright.
[180:11.04]Two plays.
[180:13.59]he intercepted that play not with his hands that's right first down 30 yards to go capitalize on an interception it's a championship game for god's sakes don't throw it into triple coverage oh my god you can't blame it all on the sloppy conditions I mean the other guys have the same weather out there if if one guy's balls are slippery than the other guy's balls they're just as slippery
[180:46.33]I have an unleash.
[180:48.15]Go for the quarterback.
[181:07.91]See if I can get that quarterback here.
[181:10.13]I would have had it too.
[181:13.44]This is bad.
[181:16.68]God damn it.
[181:18.58]I would have had it too.
[181:19.40]I was a tenth of a second late on the sack.
[181:23.11]I thought I could get it.
[181:33.34]Fucking interception.
[181:34.16]Into an interception.
[181:34.98]Ugh.
[181:42.78]Pick the play.
[181:44.99]Let's go.
[182:00.61]I have to be careful because he has it unleashed.
[182:02.89]He could strip the ball from me right now if he really wanted to.
[182:05.02]Great blocking.
[182:06.36]It's okay.
[182:07.90]Get it to Sullivan.
[182:10.82]Sure.
[182:25.81]Fuck, I can't get anything going.
[182:26.67]I'm trying to activate the unleash, but they keep denying it.
[182:55.16]right over him that should be a touchdown there it is don't just just score score score score
[183:09.29]He landed on his keys.
[183:12.09]Yeah, I wasn't gonna taunt.
[183:12.85]I decided against it.
[183:38.44]Brand new ball game.
[183:53.62]How did you miss that one?
[183:55.30]Sir!
[183:57.86]Honest to God.
[183:59.72]How did I miss the first one?
[184:02.04]First and 30.
[184:04.13]How is it even, whatever, I'm fine.
[184:05.97]And I just did a goal line play.
[184:08.62]There it is, I got it all back.
[184:09.64]I'm getting killed though on every category.
[184:11.16]Second and 40, they got a long way to go.
[184:34.70]It's not far enough.
[184:37.82]Same deal.
[184:39.27]They're in 31.
[184:44.33]They're in field goal range, I think.
[184:46.29]There it is.
[184:57.16]Hold them to field goal.
[185:00.34]My computer just blue screened after that Madden joke.
[185:04.22]I'm sorry to hear that.
[185:05.08]By the way, I'm doing a punt return.
[185:11.96]He's gonna miss it.
[185:20.76]Sorry, everything's good.
[185:27.66]I might be able to get a touchdown here if I play the cards right.
[185:34.17]You can't.
[185:34.69]Come on.
[185:34.99]Hammer through that.
[185:46.28]Looking for a first down here.
[185:49.28]That was good.
[185:54.44]Electrocute his brain.
[185:55.61]Get him out of the game for now.
[185:59.59]That didn't even do much for me either.
[186:00.93]That guy was right in front of me.
[186:04.04]Where are my blockers?
[186:09.98]Second and 18.
[186:22.12]Ooh, oh god.
[186:23.28]This is bad.
[186:27.74]Third down.
[186:29.99]back spasms you should be back in like one play just take it easy man take it easy come on settle down four plays what are those guys trying to pull why not just get up some automatic weapons can I get it got it and that is more than enough for a first down
[186:59.39]That guy was just barely about to not be open.
[187:02.01]I got really lucky there.
[187:07.17]Unleashed is scaring the shit out of me.
[187:10.22]Almost half time.
[187:18.78]Yeah, coming up.
[187:19.50]I have to score at least once here.
[187:37.56]Get close enough for a field goal.
[187:45.50]No!
[187:55.86]It's hard to aim this.
[188:04.26]Fucking god damn it.
[188:05.32]It's so hard to do that with the analog.
[188:08.30]The analog is so sloppy.
[188:09.72]You have no idea how difficult that is to move that.
[188:23.29]You can't, it moves so much.
[188:26.11]Trust me when I say that it's not easy to do that.
[188:34.96]No timeouts.
[188:35.52]They're gonna get another fucking field goal, no they're not.
[188:41.74]Right here.
[188:42.22]Dupreeh.
[188:44.96]Miss it.
[188:46.33]Of course they can do it perfect.
[188:48.63]AI's gonna do it fucking perfect every time.
[188:50.33]Ah, fuck.
[188:50.55]At least I get the ball.
[189:11.72]The AI is not blaming its controller.
[189:13.70]No!
[189:14.63]Aiming with a field goal.
[189:17.75]Go get this game and do it.
[189:19.27]And we'll have a discussion about it.
[189:28.98]Okay.
[189:37.13]Their defense is so good.
[189:40.37]Third fucking down.
[189:41.21]Get across.
[189:41.59]Bingo.
[189:41.75]Right there.
[189:42.47]Just run it in.
[190:06.76]We got good meter.
[190:08.04]Almost there, just walk it in.
[190:09.28]You know, my favorite play.
[190:10.40]Hey, I got it.
[190:10.84]All that matters is the art.
[190:36.53]Yeah, I crossed the plane.
[190:39.00]We crossed the plane, we're good.
[190:40.86]Meter.
[191:07.46]See if I can get a fumble.
[191:15.81]Where are we?
[191:16.27]Goal line.
[191:18.05]Balanced.
[191:18.91]Crush.
[191:20.99]No.
[191:21.93]Balanced?
[191:24.75]Safety push.
[191:29.19]No dog shit.
[191:31.32]It's a close game.
[191:32.28]It's gonna stay that way.
[191:34.68]And that was my tackle when I was supposed to get him.
[191:41.93]He snuck right through and got like 10 yards.
[191:43.59]Humble.
[191:44.09]Oh well.
[191:45.89]No field goal, no more gain, no first down.
[192:09.05]Thank you very much.
[192:09.83]I'll take it.
[192:10.23]Yes.
[192:10.85]This offense doesn't seem to want to take care of the ball.
[192:12.91]I mean, I don't know what kind of father these guys are.
[192:14.35]He took too long to throw it.
[192:15.33]But if I was their baby's mama, I'd think twice about letting them take the kids to the sausage factory.
[192:19.35]Because before you know it, those kids are in the grind.
[192:22.46]What the hell is he talking about?
[192:31.68]Almost.
[192:34.66]Fourth quarter.
[192:36.38]Division II championship.
[192:38.98]I am focused, I'm alert, and I'm ready.
[192:45.80]Second and 24.
[192:46.30]Let's try to get a quick pass over here on the left.
[192:48.42]How could you let that happen?
[193:09.12]Yes Back on the sidewalk kind of fall forward at the same speed.
[193:13.10]I mean you're still similar there but
[193:38.47]21-13.
[193:38.93]He needs a touchdown and a two-point conversion.
[193:42.84]Or it's over.
[193:44.18]And I win the goddamn championship.
[193:50.36]No bullshit.
[193:51.16]No bogus plays where he runs back the whole thing.
[193:53.26]I can try to strip it.
[194:13.99]That's perfect.
[194:15.17]That's exactly what I needed right now.
[194:16.73]That's two interceptions.
[194:19.87]Who is that?
[194:20.13]No, not Sullivan.
[194:20.53]Again.
[194:20.93]No, this is the championship game.
[194:22.01]I can't lose him for like five games.
[194:23.37]Again.
[194:43.96]Okay, don't blow this.
[194:44.92]He'll come back in in like three plays.
[194:49.89]One play.
[194:51.97]Thank God.
[194:52.67]That would have been the whole game probably if I fucked that up.
[195:02.74]Second and goal.
[195:12.10]Hold it.
[195:13.86]Hold it.
[195:14.34]Hold it.
[195:14.66]You know when I see that?
[195:16.04]When I see some guy just wallop a guy like a water buffalo would wallop a chihuahua?
[195:19.69]All I can think of is, man, I am glad I am not a chihuahua.
[195:23.97]Going for my favorite play.
[195:25.59]Right in the middle.
[195:26.89]Just sneak it in.
[195:29.69]Third and goal.
[195:35.54]Full line.
[195:36.28]Touchdown!
[195:37.50]Franchise rings the dinner bell again.
[195:44.20]I'd say you get hurt, but it's okay.
[195:46.06]28-13.
[195:46.10]Just round the clock.
[196:17.21]They made all these sound effects with their mouth.
[196:22.01]That'd be actually pretty ridiculous.
[196:32.08]It'd be 31 if I made that field goal.
[196:33.70]Well, we don't need it though.
[196:39.10]I made up for the fact that we don't need that field goal.
[196:47.02]Powerbomb.
[196:50.77]There goes their quarterback.
[196:56.65]Bruce Kidney out for three plays, and that's going to be the three plays that you need the most.
[197:01.59]So you're definitely lost again.
[197:04.35]Let's try to do it.
[197:08.74]Let's hurt this guy, too.
[197:13.28]He's tackled close to a first down.
[197:16.04]Game of 30.
[197:23.49]no ball explosion we've seen it like three or four times tonight though third and short for this offense damn it it's alright let him have one and he's in the end zone the receiver turn what could have been just a routine pass play into a great game and takes it into the end zone
[197:55.66]I'm just going to run the clock out and the game's going to end.
[198:05.88]It's the very end of the game.
[198:19.56]It's alright.
[198:20.58]Here we go.
[198:20.98]Here we go.
[198:22.64]Hold on, man.
[198:23.12]I'll give you a hand.
[198:23.62]Come on.
[198:25.73]Nice.
[198:26.19]What do we want to do here?
[198:27.11]Just run.
[198:27.57]Burn the timeouts.
[198:28.23]Oh my fucking god.
[198:56.64]It's okay.
[198:58.02]It's gonna be for like the whole season.
[199:00.00]Seven games, but there's no more games to play.
[199:04.18]Don't just injure my whole team and make this fucking whole thing... No!
[199:15.67]Jesus Christ!
[199:17.03]You didn't even aim!
[199:18.19]You aimed for the head!
[199:19.13]That's halfback halfback!
[199:22.76]How many halfbacks do I have?
[199:26.11]Why do you guys have to share the same problem?
[199:29.01]Who's the halfback now?
[199:30.09]Just give it to them.
[199:33.97]Who the fuck is this?
[199:34.73]Peter?
[199:35.05]Fuck, it's fourth down.
[199:44.87]Am I in field goal range?
[199:45.85]Am I about to fucking have a meltdown?
[199:48.05]Alright.
[200:06.10]What was wrong with that?
[200:06.94]What was wrong with that?
[200:08.40]Wind.
[200:09.04]This is not good.
[200:16.03]All they need is a touchdown and they're not gonna get it.
[200:33.12]Yes.
[200:34.36]Dead.
[200:34.60]That was Williams.
[200:38.82]That was the star quarterback.
[200:40.48]That should seal the deal right there.
[200:41.64]Now, just play prevention.
[200:42.58]Just play smart.
[200:43.10]This quarterback sucks.
[201:09.30]Oh my fucking god.
[201:10.34]Not this time.
[201:15.16]Same deal, just... Man, just prevent.
[201:21.52]Just cover everything.
[201:22.94]Just stay out.
[201:35.67]Last play of the game.
[201:39.73]Fuck you.
[201:41.71]Game over.
[201:42.11]I win.
[201:42.41]Championship.
[201:42.85]Division 2 championship.
[201:44.01]More touchdowns.
[201:44.89]I unlocked everything.
[201:45.87]Moving on to D1.
[202:14.23]LT Session.
[202:16.51]Loader.
[202:17.05]Silver.
[202:17.49]Ooh!
[202:21.27]New touchdown code.
[202:22.55]Circle XX Circle is Pylon Kick.
[202:27.72]Finally.
[202:28.42]Took long enough.
[202:33.06]Took six and a half hours to make a new one.
[202:37.01]More than that.
[202:39.08]Hey, Franchise, how's it feel to be moving up to Division One?
[202:41.92]Feels awesome!
[202:43.04]We're gonna play for the league title next year, baby.
[202:46.78]Uh-oh.
[202:47.40]Here comes the scumbag.
[202:50.55]Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
[202:52.67]I hate to break up the festivities, but I have an important announcement to make.
[202:58.35]Last night, the Minnesota Reapers chartered a yacht and held a party on Lake Minnewanka.
[203:04.32]Tragically, the party got out of hand and the boat sank.
[203:07.68]Seven players and a self-employed model were drowned.
[203:12.41]Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.
[203:15.49]What?
[203:20.37]The League and the Reapers have decided that the team will suspend operations for next season, out of respect for the victims and the community.
[203:29.56]That leaves one spot open in Division 1.
[203:31.86]Oh, shit.
[203:32.66]Here it comes.
[203:33.82]A random drawing was just conducted in my office, and the team that has been promoted from Division 2 is... The L.A.
[203:41.04]Riot.
[203:41.52]The L.A.
[203:42.96]Riot.
[203:44.42]Fucking douchebag.
[203:50.03]Oh, wow.
[203:50.47]We just won the championship.
[203:51.95]That doesn't make any sense.
[203:56.05]They didn't win the championship.
[203:58.47]What's up, Carl?
[203:59.27]Oh, yes.
[203:59.53]Absolutely.
[204:00.01]The draft.
[204:01.01]Here it is.
[204:01.47]We get to pick a new player.
[204:02.36]Remember this guy from prison?
[204:03.54]Right defensive end.
[204:04.26]Look at this.
[204:34.92]No, this is it.
[204:37.22]I just can either accept him or not accept him.
[204:41.84]Look at that speed agility.
[204:42.88]I just get him.
[204:46.65]100 resist injury.
[204:47.47]He's never going to get hurt.
[204:52.55]Yeah.
[204:53.07]I can't select anybody else, right?
[204:54.51]There's no other options.
[204:56.69]It's just this.
[204:57.29]Let's go.
[205:03.28]200 plus combined yards.
[205:04.04]Alright, we're in D1.
[205:04.86]Just to make sure everyone's in the right spot.
[205:33.92]Quarterback, that's me.
[205:36.50]Halfback, that's Sullivan.
[205:42.09]Ashburn sure has kind of climbed the rankings here.
[205:45.57]A minus.
[205:50.49]A plus punter.
[205:51.33]We're never going to have to use him.
[205:53.62]Let's take a look.
[205:56.66]Cruz and Tirpitz.
[206:01.80]This is a pretty great team.
[206:04.78]I'm happy about it.
[206:10.30]Uh, Mexico City Aztecs is the next, uh, team.
[206:13.24]Let's see what I got.
[206:16.40]Plus six hands, +2 speed.
[206:18.08]Okay.
[206:21.61]I don't have enough money to do anything.
[206:25.55]I don't think so, at least.
[206:29.29]No.
[206:31.47]Uh, resist injury.
[206:34.81]Yeah.
[206:36.05]Massage therapy, that's maxed out now.
[206:41.80]Alright, let's go.
[206:43.60]D'oh!
[206:49.38]Uh... Well... That is a create-a-character cheat team.
[206:56.91]Good luck.
[206:57.81]I'm not betting any money here.
[207:01.18]This week we play the Aztecs.
[207:03.45]Word is the Mexican government paid the league a mint to move them from Dallas to Mexico City.
[207:08.81]Thanks to tight end Felix Fortain, the team is still a title contender.
[207:13.25]Crazy work ethic, hands like Velcro, and he loves contact.
[207:18.56]Rumor has it he's been using the team's plane to transport steroids across the border.
[207:23.26]Mexico loves Fortain, and he loves them right back.
[207:26.91]Hard life, huh?
[207:30.51]We're gonna get our asses kicked.
[207:39.58]We're gonna lose real bad.
[207:45.28]That's the spirit?
[207:48.18]This is D1.
[207:54.99]Tight end.
[207:58.63]I gotta win five games.
[208:02.79]200 plus combined yards this game.
[208:12.74]The heat is a factor.
[208:13.98]You see the waves there?
[208:25.01]Corner look.
[208:25.83]That haze.
[208:26.61]I wonder how well that affects him.
[208:29.53]He does a factor in Mexico, but not in Las Vegas.
[208:32.23]Yeah, I'm not sure how.
[208:34.67]I'm going to go with
[208:54.80]Go with a good pass here.
[208:58.04]I might just sneak over.
[209:01.62]What the hell was that?
[209:02.40]Damn it.
[209:02.79]I thought I could sneak over there.
[209:04.21]Out of my way.
[209:04.75]The dive seems to work.
[209:25.29]A lock for me Cut across, cut across, cut across!
[209:32.00]Thank you That's a beautiful juke from Sullivan
[209:51.63]What is it?
[209:52.37]What is it?
[209:52.71]What is it?
[209:52.93]What is it?
[209:53.29]That was dumb.
[209:53.61]What a great unlockable that was.
[209:54.43]He just kicks the pylon.
[209:55.33]Stay up.
[210:29.33]So now with their possession... Gotta be aware... of the guy.
[210:35.53]He has the tight end, right?
[210:45.34]Holy shit, this guy knew exactly what he was doing here.
[210:49.68]Wait!
[210:50.10]No, no!
[210:50.68]I didn't want to do him in the ass!
[210:51.70]I want to do it in the back!
[210:55.33]I would have, I would have broken his spine.
[210:59.93]I tried to do it and it slipped out.
[211:01.81]Number 81.
[211:02.11]Watch 81.
[211:02.29]D1 is going to be hell.
[211:33.52]Miraculously still hands-on.
[211:35.24]Blitz him.
[211:37.59]I see what you're doing.
[211:54.23]How the hell did you... I got tricked.
[211:58.83]They tricked me.
[211:59.33]I thought it was going to be a hand-off run.
[212:01.27]Whatever.
[212:12.81]Oh, that's alright.
[212:19.15]Tie game.
[212:24.37]Who kicked the ball?
[212:26.49]You wanna get tricked?
[212:27.85]Fine.
[212:28.39]I'm gonna do a snowflake.
[212:33.63]I don't even know what this does.
[212:48.10]I didn't even do that He ran to the left on his own
[212:54.04]I blame snowflake.
[212:56.06]That's what I blame for real.
[213:18.32]and how excuse me gentlemen how do you not catch that it was right to you it was right to you I blocked 81 I took him out and the ball was thrown right to your hands fumble thank you
[213:48.44]I'll take it.
[213:48.94]Let's try a run.
[213:49.52]That's not good.
[213:50.00]Oh, that's not good.
[213:50.88]It's all a win again.
[214:13.56]Beru's kidney.
[214:15.30]Get a good injection, he should be fine in about three plays.
[214:17.46]Good enough.
[214:17.98]Why aren't they showing the announcer's face?
[214:20.25]Probably extra money.
[214:21.25]Second to 25.
[214:42.76]Ooh, first down.
[214:43.68]Las Vegas had everyone on the same page there, and they are rewarded with a very nice game.
[214:50.92]The offense looking at first and 30.
[214:52.64]Hawks is going to get the ball, and he's going to get his T-bone shattered, whatever the hell that is.
[215:03.93]So we've managed to run for like, hmm.
[215:07.19]Try to get a downfield play here.
[215:09.45]Good?
[215:09.99]You good to go?
[215:10.99]Go get him.
[215:12.51]With under a minute to play in the half, we're all tied up.
[215:20.19]Shit, is it third and 15?
[215:23.11]Whoa, is it possible we're making progress?
[215:26.68]While we're at it, let's try scoring.
[215:31.06]Got to make something happen here.
[215:34.86]And the defender gets a hand on it, and it's incomplete.
[215:43.43]Fuck it.
[215:45.15]It's goddamn Division 1.
[215:46.03]You gotta make plays.
[215:46.69]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[215:57.21]I have an acid reflux!
[215:58.62]He has the same five lines.
[215:59.72]John Madden 2 has the same five lines.
[216:14.71]Now I know why somebody said, can you please mute him?
[216:16.33]I was like, what are they talking about?
[216:20.41]Now I get it.
[216:30.38]Second quarter.
[216:30.92]Up by a touchdown.
[216:40.79]I blew that one.
[216:41.17]That was actually botched.
[216:41.95]How did you still throw it?
[216:43.07]If that's me as a quarterback, how do you throw that perfect throw?
[217:08.17]Let's watch.
[217:09.49]So he gets fucking tackled and then underhand throws the ball perfectly to the guy downfield.
[217:16.66]I don't understand.
[217:25.90]I almost had it.
[217:27.04]It's D1.
[217:27.30]Goddamn D1.
[217:44.89]Not gonna win that one.
[217:54.34]Let's give Snowflake another chance.
[217:57.42]I'm never doing that play ever again.
[217:58.54]I went the wrong way?
[217:59.72]The computer had control.
[218:18.46]When he gets the ball, he runs to the left.
[218:20.54]I don't have control of the game.
[218:23.10]He takes control and runs left and then gets tackled by the same guy every time.
[218:30.14]I have not had control of the character every time I've done that play.
[218:38.19]He runs to the left and gets tackled.
[218:46.13]Always going for the guys like balls.
[218:56.79]Do a balance D, I think.
[218:58.61]I saw that one coming from a mile away.
[219:00.09]Second 26.
[219:28.62]He's waiting for you.
[219:37.49]Although they're pretty close, though.
[219:46.27]Third and seven.
[219:50.77]Incomplete pass.
[219:51.45]Here we go.
[219:52.13]And then they're gonna kick it.
[220:00.97]That was fucking brutal.
[220:02.59]That was brutal and we got the ball and it's a touchdown.
[220:04.57]It has to be.
[220:12.28]Six plays.
[220:17.41]That's the best possible scenario here.
[220:21.41]I'm going to say...
[220:29.54]Clear.
[220:30.00]I don't even know what play is.
[220:36.38]Oh, that's stupid.
[220:41.79]I really like this play, the corner look.
[220:45.91]Watch that Unleashed!
[220:51.49]Here comes Not28, please!
[220:56.55]Not- No, not Sullivan.
[221:00.75]No, he's gone forever.
[221:02.85]Ruptured scrotum.
[221:04.41]Five games.
[221:06.67]I need him in the game right now.
[221:08.15]That's not good.
[221:09.05]This is bad.
[221:09.59]Okay.
[221:09.85]It's an easy kick.
[221:32.61]Perfect, right?
[221:34.37]The field goal is good.
[221:35.65]That almost didn't go through.
[221:40.15]I just never really feel comfortable in my pants.
[221:42.25]I don't know what it is.
[221:43.43]I know I'm supposed to wear them.
[221:44.69]I'm expected to wear them.
[221:46.11]But something keeps telling me not to trust them.
[222:00.72]Broken call button.
[222:01.38]You gotta be up for at least five games.
[222:08.34]Got a fresh unleash.
[222:11.90]Let's kill the quarterback.
[222:13.94]I'm going for it.
[222:14.99]I'm just blitzing.
[222:15.55]Fuck it.
[222:21.23]Fuck!
[222:21.61]I thought I had it.
[222:24.95]Oh, I thought I had it.
[222:25.93]I really thought I did.
[222:27.61]I really thought it was gonna happen.
[222:29.15]Good job, safety.
[222:29.85]I thought I had it.
[222:30.47]That was a given.
[222:31.07]It was a given that I was gonna get that.
[222:32.44]Beautiful.
[222:53.95]I don't got a good halfback.
[222:54.71]Kane, you fucking idiot.
[222:55.41]I was about to say that was great, but it wasn't.
[222:56.97]It was awful.
[222:57.45]It was just awful.
[223:33.21]I'm so mad about that fumble, because that was the turnaround of the game right there.
[223:36.54]This is going to be another one of those games where I'm going to be down by three or four points.
[223:40.20]How many times is that going to happen to me?
[224:04.32]Thank you.
[224:05.00]Alright, Dupreeh.
[224:05.76]And that's a touchback.
[224:06.68]No, it's okay.
[224:07.60]It's okay.
[224:07.85]There's been a guy that's been intercepting all game.
[224:09.69]You know what?
[224:11.03]Fuck it.
[224:11.33]We're going with an unleash catch.
[224:12.85]That's a guaranteed catch.
[224:13.95]Eat shit.
[224:16.69]Touchdown.
[224:32.14]And he's tackled at the two-yard line.
[224:34.60]Las Vegas tears up a good chunk of field there.
[224:37.26]You know what I'm doing.
[224:38.83]First and goal.
[224:39.67]It's gut check time.
[224:40.87]Ball spotted at the two-yard line.
[224:44.01]Touchdown!
[224:48.39]Thank God.
[224:58.31]What's worse, this or a beer chug?
[225:01.02]I wonder.
[225:06.40]Everybody was so desperate to get a different celebration.
[225:09.82]Now you have pylon kick.
[225:19.56]Keep giving franchise yards.
[225:41.58]And that would have been a touchdown.
[225:49.51]Who the fuck is Franchise?
[225:50.43]I only know who Mr. Superbowl is.
[226:04.52]Good.
[226:04.80]Let them run the clock.
[226:05.52]Let them go down the field as long as they want.
[226:06.90]It's impossible for them to get any more.
[226:11.66]And then I just gotta not throw any interceptions just run the ball around the clock out games over first division one game complete This is fine, I don't care how many points you score right now Launch it
[226:44.84]It's a guarantee.
[226:45.62]He guaranteed it.
[226:46.66]It's fine.
[226:47.18]He used his Unleash.
[226:48.20]Doesn't matter how many points he gets.
[226:49.68]I have a ball.
[226:50.00]How long is this gonna... It is 20... At best... Yeah.
[226:51.26]See?
[226:51.38]The 44 seconds just run every play.
[226:52.56]Don't do anything.
[226:53.48]No Unleash.
[226:53.84]Don't do anything stupid.
[226:54.82]Run the ball.
[227:15.32]Easy.
[227:15.62]Is my halfback in the game?
[227:20.34]No.
[227:20.68]Yeah.
[227:23.29]That's what I said.
[227:25.13]Alright, Cox, you have to really pull through here.
[227:41.51]Wait, the timeout?
[227:42.49]They have one more timeout?
[227:43.81]That's fine.
[227:44.21]Here's the other timeout.
[227:45.23]Third and... nah, let's just call it third and aways.
[228:15.49]Why did... Where is he running?
[228:17.35]Oh, excuse me.
[228:19.45]Excuse me.
[228:20.39]I did not do that.
[228:24.02]He just started running.
[228:26.70]Why the fuck did you do that?
[228:30.36]Oh, shit.
[228:42.39]You gotta be kidding me.
[228:47.18]I'm panicking.
[228:49.50]Guys... They don't have any timeouts.
[229:00.79]I'm about to have an Unleashed.
[229:01.95]Alright, there's no reason why they get the ball to the end zone.
[229:06.07]With an Unleashed.
[229:08.65]Not a single reason with me with an Unleashed full meter.
[229:12.21]You don't have any more timeouts.
[229:14.05]The person that gets this ball is dead.
[229:18.17]Un-fucking-believable.
[229:21.09]They don't have any time.
[229:22.28]It's over.
[229:24.18]Good luck.
[229:25.12]I don't know what play I'm gonna pick.
[229:26.64]Maybe I should pick... Wait, what?
[229:28.98]This is their last play.
[229:31.30]Fuck you.
[229:46.64]That was so close.
[229:51.46]I was so scared.
[229:56.69]I had to wait until the last second because he was doing a clash catch.
[230:03.09]That would have been so disappointing.
[230:06.94]But that's the first game in Division 1 completed.
[230:16.81]I only have $290,000.
[230:17.19]That's not good.
[230:18.01]Uh, Pronghorn gear.
[230:24.41]Unlocked.
[230:27.35]Yeah, that was just the first one.
[230:28.43]I have to win four more games.
[230:31.81]And then I get to go to the absolute complete championship.
[230:36.53]Hi, Franchise.
[230:37.56]This is Grace.
[230:38.86]I hope you don't mind me being forward, but seeing as we're working on the same ad campaign,
[230:43.08]I thought you might like to get together for drinks this evening.
[230:45.72]So, see you at the club tonight?
[230:47.80]Each division is a new girlfriend.
[230:50.84]Tara is trying to call me.
[230:55.59]Nice to finally meet you in person.
[230:57.57]I'll second that.
[230:58.87]I hear the commercial shoot went well.
[231:00.85]That's what my agent tells me.
[231:02.81]At least he returns your calls.
[231:04.69]My lame-ass agent is too distracted with his new client.
[231:08.01]Anyone I heard of?
[231:09.33]Some hotshot league captain.
[231:11.19]Tyler something.
[231:12.43]You play him this Sunday.
[231:14.19]You know, football is a rough game.
[231:17.49]Accidents happen.
[231:19.01]Even the league captains.
[231:20.67]So I've heard.
[231:21.73]I'd be especially grateful if such an accident were to occur.
[231:29.09]What the fuck is this?
[231:30.89]That lingered for a long time.
[231:32.25]Alright.
[231:32.63]Hi Tara.
[231:33.07]Sorry.
[231:33.95]What's the new sponsor we got?
[231:34.91]Spider webs plus eight hands.
[231:57.50]It's not ultra-light?
[231:58.30]Yeah.
[231:58.74]Pronghorn.
[231:59.10]There they are.
[232:01.02]Oh, it's all Pronghorn.
[232:03.78]No, no, bring back the drugs.
[232:05.62]What is... No, she's still... We're still together.
[232:11.77]Hey, look who's injured.
[232:12.65]It's Sullivan again.
[232:13.43]I don't have enough money.
[232:20.77]I think hands will be the next upgrade.
[232:26.89]How are we doing on drugs?
[232:27.79]Way too much risk.
[232:28.59]I'm not doing it.
[232:31.65]And I want to save money.
[232:33.47]So I don't want to spend $20,000, $30,000 right now.
[232:35.25]We're just going to have to go in the way we are.
[232:42.88]Against the Denver Grizzlies.
[232:50.82]Both want to know, Las Vegas must win by more than four points.
[232:54.90]Max bet.
[232:55.81]So take out... Take out fast guy.
[233:30.45]I will do my best.
[233:42.70]So they have a lack of depth.
[233:47.50]Hello, everybody.
[233:49.56]Franchise must injure Tyler Neal this game here.
[233:54.24]I'll try.
[233:54.66]I should get it.
[234:04.33]Can someone... I don't know what it is with returns.
[234:09.75]Kick returns.
[234:10.45]I just... That's how I lose half the games.
[234:13.49]And by half the games, I mean two.
[234:14.65]We've only lost two games in the whole entire franchise.
[234:20.53]Where's he at?
[234:21.59]Right there.
[234:22.25]Ooh, you are fast.
[234:34.71]28, too.
[234:35.23]Okay.
[234:35.51]This is gonna be pain.
[234:41.14]I have to hurt him.
[234:42.54]He's gonna be hell to deal with.
[234:47.70]Oh, that was so embarrassing.
[234:49.16]Whatever.
[234:50.76]He just juked me so hard.
[234:53.28]It's alright.
[235:07.33]I have to take care of that guy.
[235:13.50]That guy's gonna be a thorn.
[235:14.74]Max bet I have to win by four points.
[235:16.58]There it is.
[235:17.04]The acid reflux joke.
[235:17.68]Hey, guess who's not in the lineup and there's a problem.
[235:42.95]Somebody get open!
[235:44.79]Someone get open!
[235:47.61]I don't know who to throw it to, just go!
[235:58.90]What can you say about this guy?
[236:00.82]He just gets the job done.
[236:04.41]That was a long time, but it's okay.
[236:09.85]First down, 30 yards to go.
[236:19.30]It's always my halfbacks.
[236:24.36]We're going to back up, back up, halfback again.
[236:27.12]Ah, fuck.
[236:27.50]Oops.
[236:27.62]It's always halfback.
[236:28.26]Who the hell is he?
[236:29.80]Who is it?
[236:30.32]Barry, what's his name?
[236:48.10]Bartholomew, what's this guy's name?
[236:49.52]Oh, don't have to talk to him about Baxter.
[236:55.00]Now, that was an impressive run.
[236:58.03]I wish I could run like that.
[236:59.23]I mean, if that were me out there running, it would probably make people sick, especially me.
[237:03.81]But I still wish I could do it.
[237:07.43]Branch eyes, skips his team, and he's set it down.
[237:10.03]Touchdown!
[237:16.96]Touchdown!
[237:23.48]Tie game.
[237:34.43]Gives this team a new set of downs.
[237:43.41]I'm gonna kick a knock down my middle.
[237:44.43]Hit it like in the corner.
[237:52.09]Oh, boy.
[237:52.80]The Unleashed.
[237:54.46]Yeah, I can do that too, you know.
[237:55.94]I can do that too!
[237:58.34]Fumble.
[237:59.72]Do it!
[238:00.26]Oh, shit.
[238:01.32]Thank God.
[238:01.74]Yes.
[238:02.80]Did somebody fall on it?
[238:04.14]Okay.
[238:04.83]Second quarter.
[238:24.38]Looking for the guy to come across the field.
[238:26.22]Going to triangle.
[238:26.98]I can't believe he caught that.
[238:28.72]Good job.
[238:29.14]Happy 56th birthday.
[238:34.25]56th.
[238:34.99]They've given themselves a great opportunity here in the red zone.
[239:00.74]Let's cut this left corner Alright, you know what I'm doing Every time
[239:38.46]Let's take a 2-0 in Division 1.
[239:42.36]Why do Americans like this stupid sport?
[239:46.15]I don't know.
[239:47.61]Why does anybody like any sport?
[239:49.71]Why do people like golf?
[239:51.90]Why do people like to fish?
[239:52.86]I don't know.
[240:10.27]Alright.
[240:10.93]Unleash.
[240:15.33]I'd rather watch Wii bowling.
[240:17.77]Well, you're about to watch somebody beat a championship and get to the Super Bowl and win.
[240:24.73]That's too bad.
[240:25.45]I tried to turn around and catch it.
[240:30.55]Injury.
[240:39.54]There's the injury I was looking for.
[240:48.92]That's a new sponsor.
[240:49.80]There goes your star player.
[240:51.18]Good.
[240:51.40]Now I can relax a little.
[241:10.58]Where's he going with it?
[241:11.76]He just... Really?
[241:13.26]Their backup is better.
[241:14.64]That'd be really odd.
[241:15.58]I always just assume they go for it, because I go for it 75% of the time.
[241:47.08]What are these colors for?
[241:48.24]They're supposed to be my colors.
[241:52.31]Like my channel colors.
[241:55.39]Somehow.
[241:56.87]Asshole.
[241:57.13]Who gets the ball at the half?
[242:01.13]Taco Bell.
[242:29.81]Alright.
[242:39.92]Unleash.
[242:42.30]A lot of the good starting players are gone, so that's good.
[242:49.94]Come up on third down, right?
[242:52.38]Third and 22.
[242:52.76]Broken collarbone is the new beer chub.
[242:58.94]Are they going for a field goal?
[243:00.72]Field goal blocked, right?
[243:01.58]Oh, no they're not.
[243:02.25]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[243:03.49]No, no, no.
[243:03.81]This is not good.
[243:22.48]Good.
[243:24.30]At least five or six people touched that.
[243:25.81]He was bouncing around on everybody.
[243:42.44]I got one more play here to try.
[243:44.79]Should I just get a field goal or should I go for it?
[243:47.11]Field goal.
[243:47.81]Be safe.
[243:50.57]Safe.
[243:51.11]Field goal.
[243:54.07]No, fuck it.
[243:54.59]We're going for it.
[243:57.26]End zone.
[244:07.03]Should have just got a fucking field goal.
[244:09.04]And so, at halftime, Las Vegas leads by seven.
[244:16.88]Somebody fucking called me a wuss, so I had to do it.
[244:19.36]I looked over and he was like, oh, you baby.
[244:22.12]Okay.
[244:25.48]How's that for a baby?
[244:29.02]Now that was a sweet run.
[244:32.72]He did a great job of finding the hole and bursting through it.
[244:39.85]First down 30 yards to go Outrageous that was a trick play I
[245:08.49]It was so tricky, nobody knew what the fuck happened.
[245:19.66]Alright, you know what I'm gonna do.
[245:22.76]You already know what I'm doing.
[245:24.66]And he's in the end zone!
[245:40.68]27.
[245:40.74]Good.
[245:40.98]Be your chug to nose wipe.
[246:03.39]I would say of all the mistakes in my life, and there have been a couple, you know, eating bananas with jalapeños makes it one of the biggest.
[246:08.68]Uh-oh.
[246:09.20]And a girl in San Diego just made a mistake.
[246:10.94]Eating bananas with jalapeños.
[246:13.28]Apparently that's a mistake somehow.
[246:16.30]Huh?
[246:16.86]Okay.
[246:17.44]Eating bananas with jalapeños, you know.
[246:24.52]That's how you do John Menn.
[246:25.92]He does the talk with kind of a high voice at first.
[246:30.62]Oh my fucking god, I'm talking and that's why I fucked it up.
[246:33.34]I need to focus.
[246:33.90]That receiver.
[246:34.38]I don't think I've ever had a reblood, you know.
[246:54.48]God dammit.
[247:08.29]Reversal, that's fine.
[247:13.13]That doesn't sound like Madden at all.
[247:14.33]It does?
[247:17.84]If you had to take a guess who that was, who would you say that was?
[247:22.22]Okay, ready?
[247:23.96]I mean, just think about it.
[247:27.14]Who am I?
[247:29.23]If you've never heard that before.
[247:30.17]This game just got a whole heck of a lot more exciting.
[247:34.49]And giddy.
[247:34.81]You.
[247:34.99]And the extra point is good.
[247:36.41]Alright, baby, come on.
[247:59.79]Damn it.
[248:00.15]Alright, let's do it You see how lightning my reflexes just were right there Alright, I got to do this right the first time hold on try and hold still buddy Come on, buddy
[248:30.10]It's alright.
[248:32.88]It wasn't a bad run.
[248:35.72]13-yard loss.
[248:57.54]Those trick plays.
[249:00.60]I'm pretty convinced that the trick plays are only in the game for when you play against another human.
[249:05.50]A friend of yours.
[249:06.34]It doesn't fool the computer.
[249:22.16]Do me a favor, will ya?
[249:23.82]Tell these guys they're suppo- Alright, you're right.
[249:27.14]Let me see.
[249:28.18]Good?
[249:28.74]Good to go?
[249:29.64]Nimbus is back.
[249:30.72]I have to go for a clash catch here.
[249:34.97]Even if it's turnover, but I don't care.
[249:38.25]Lofts one.
[249:41.39]Makes the catch.
[249:42.57]Full line!
[249:44.81]Touchdown!
[249:57.38]That was really, really important.
[250:00.18]It helps me seal it.
[250:06.52]You know that they're an awful friend when they make you play this game.
[250:12.46]This is a... This game is great!
[250:28.12]See if I can get the ball here.
[250:33.88]Worth a shot.
[250:35.86]Fourth quarter.
[250:37.14]Up by a lot.
[250:38.28]A true friend plays paper football.
[250:43.75]I look like the toxic Avenger.
[250:56.98]It's my colors.
[250:58.26]It's my green and pink color.
[251:02.82]I had to get an injury for the third girlfriend?
[251:18.47]No, I already did it.
[251:20.14]I took the star player out of the game in like the first quarter.
[251:30.12]What are you going to do on fourth down?
[251:32.10]A minute to go.
[251:32.54]You're definitely going to go for it.
[251:36.54]Safety blitz.
[251:37.18]First to his left, and it's caught at the 37-yard line.
[251:41.97]And he's brought down.
[251:43.19]And they turn the ball over.
[251:44.23]Now, they could have used some points right there, but the defense said, no way.
[251:48.75]Big stop there.
[251:50.95]I thought I did it with franchise.
[251:52.85]First and 30.
[252:01.45]Your team looks like the Arizona Ice-T.
[252:06.63]No, it's... Jerma985.
[252:22.38]He wasn't ready for that.
[252:24.70]He wasn't ready for that.
[252:25.92]I apologize.
[252:26.38]I'm sorry.
[252:26.89]Oh, goddammit!
[252:51.86]It's okay.
[252:52.76]It doesn't matter.
[252:54.56]I gotta win by four points.
[252:58.96]Denver sucks.
[253:00.28]Denver sucks.
[253:04.83]Where?
[253:05.59]Are you?
[253:06.25]He just threw the ball backwards.
[253:08.81]What?
[253:08.91]Why did I dive?
[253:14.77]I don't know.
[253:19.45]Why do I do anything?
[253:20.47]Why buy, like, golf?
[253:24.77]This group.
[253:26.06]I'm just going to keep somebody in the back, just in case.
[253:33.52]That's why I kept him in the back.
[253:38.46]I got one last play.
[253:53.98]Let's just be complete assholes here.
[253:56.36]Watch this.
[254:13.10]Come on, Cox!
[254:16.80]I was trying to go for like a hundred yards or something just to get it, just to pad my stats.
[254:30.64]That's a victory for the bet as well.
[254:32.49]40 grand, right?
[254:39.37]Nice.
[254:40.97]Okay.
[254:42.21]I think it's time for hands three.
[254:48.02]Polyflex Ultra Pads are the new sponsor item.
[255:01.00]Wow, you really came through for me.
[255:03.06]My stupid agent is freaking out about his new client getting hurt.
[255:06.30]He freaked out even more when I fired his ass.
[255:08.89]How about I come over tonight and show you my gratitude?
[255:25.16]Want some breakfast?
[255:27.82]That's not what I'm hungry for.
[255:33.44]I won.
[255:33.74]Okay.
[255:35.40]Hook up with Grace in campaign mode.
[255:37.33]Uh...
[255:55.78]Plus 12 resist injury.
[255:59.48]Franchise is never going to get hurt ever again.
[256:02.14]Look at this stuff.
[256:02.68]Look at these awesome things I got out of like the loot box.
[256:08.82]Alright, new girlfriend is Grace.
[256:11.42]Former tennis pro turned supermodel.
[256:14.89]She competes for the same kinds of big league endorsements franchise tries to land.
[256:21.83]Alright, injuries.
[256:23.23]Look who it is.
[256:26.72]Still up for a game.
[256:30.78]Hands 3 is 525.
[256:35.42]No more fumbles.
[256:38.82]Training, sign it automatically.
[256:41.46]And we got 23 grand.
[256:43.73]Just do the safe shit.
[256:44.73]I'm gonna give you one too.
[256:55.32]Alright.
[256:56.68]Next game is the Arizona Outlaws.
[257:03.09]Solomon is there for the first quarter of every other game.
[257:05.59]Yeah, it sucks.
[257:07.81]And when he is there, we score 30 points in a quarter.
[257:18.06]What are they, 0-2?
[257:24.07]They're a good team.
[257:24.93]Look at those stats.
[257:25.72]How do you go 0-2?
[257:28.08]Must win by more than six points.
[257:30.18]Let's just max bet it.
[257:31.48]This week we're matched up against Arizona.
[257:33.60]Division 1 title contenders with a passing game that's hard to stop.
[257:37.87]Wide receiver Tito Moss is their number one barebone threat.
[257:42.51]Little shit's been in the league ten years now, and he's just as quick and just as dirty.
[257:48.75]Unfortunately for us their defense can't stop anybody or we'd be screwed Terrible defense.
[257:54.65]Okay, good Wish I had the best halfback in the league He just did the look of me Did he
[258:17.15]They have an awful running game, so... Just gonna play zones.
[258:27.22]Speaking of the zone... I've won... pretty much every game we've played tonight.
[258:48.51]Only lost once.
[258:49.25]I don't know why I just said that, considering I'm going to jinx it.
[259:02.20]Bad yard.
[259:05.38]Knock on wood, right?
[259:06.96]Yeah.
[259:07.24]No.
[259:07.66]You see the blonde on the side?
[259:08.96]Alright, Cox.
[259:21.70]I thought the defense was supposed to suck.
[259:24.06]It's supposed to be a terrible defense.
[259:33.49]I saw it.
[259:33.93]I could throw it still.
[259:37.59]Fuck it.
[259:37.93]Let's go.
[259:39.89]This is what Bill Belichick would do.
[259:41.38]Fuck.
[259:46.83]That's... He's unable to keep his hands on that one.
[260:01.21]Not good.
[260:05.50]The receiver gets taken out before the ball gets near him.
[260:08.36]I don't think he knows what hit him.
[260:16.92]Really thought I caught one on the bombs.
[260:23.07]That is literally not what Bill Belichick would do on the first possession.
[260:28.75]I would have had it too.
[260:37.01]I've got to cover this guy.
[260:47.53]Thank you very much.
[260:52.01]Get out of the end zone.
[260:52.67]Alright, what would Bill Belichick do right now?
[261:02.12]He'd kick a field goal.
[261:05.30]No, don't make a fucking shitty joke.
[261:06.78]Let's go.
[261:07.08]I didn't.
[261:10.16]Where?
[261:10.32]Where?
[261:21.83]Las Vegas really executed on that play and took a big step down the field.
[261:25.79]Nice work Franchise demonstrated why he's considered one of the alright 24 yards.
[261:42.84]I'll take it Again do it again They have a they have an unleash
[261:52.45]I'll drop it.
[261:53.19]It's like, yeah, I'll take the hit.
[261:58.51]And that's the end of the first quarter, as we're scoreless.
[262:01.01]Because you're planning on finishing the game's story.
[262:06.71]We're pretty close.
[262:09.94]We're at... I mean, there's only three games left in the division.
[262:12.92]I can't run out of bounds.
[262:19.04]He did a great job of finding the hole and bursting through.
[262:26.72]First and goal.
[262:27.56]It's gut check time.
[262:28.76]Ball at the three-yard line.
[262:33.38]He's in the end zone.
[262:37.34]Got it.
[262:43.26]You'd think someone would have a playbook on me right now.
[262:46.25]Every time he gets to within five yards of the end zone, he jumps with the quarterback.
[262:50.61]That was pretty.
[262:51.73]Somebody tell me why we can't do that in every possession.
[262:56.76]It always works Every time?
[263:00.55]Oops Easy No injury here I will build up points, though
[263:27.92]Do another pee break.
[263:28.90]I don't have to pee yet.
[263:31.10]It hasn't been a quarterly... It's only been, what, like an hour?
[263:37.06]I usually pee three to four times per sprint.
[263:44.48]That's the guy that catches every ball.
[263:46.12]I pee like every two hours.
[263:46.88]Injury.
[263:57.79]Nope.
[264:00.77]He's getting weak.
[264:06.68]Pee it right now.
[264:07.26]Do it right now!
[264:08.16]I'm in the middle of a game!
[264:10.26]I'm in the middle of a game!
[264:18.72]HURT HIM!
[264:28.90]What a play by the captain.
[264:30.31]It just comes easy to this guy.
[264:32.45]Sure, he works hard.
[264:33.45]He has talent.
[264:34.21]But that's what makes these sorts of plays so easy for him.
[264:37.20]Bravo.
[264:37.92]It's the coach's favorite place on the field, the red zone.
[264:44.15]End zone.
[264:44.65]And that's going the other way.
[264:47.36]When you can't hold on to the ball, it's hard to execute your offense.
[264:50.92]Yes.
[264:51.08]3-0 in Division 1.
[264:51.86]Let's go.
[264:52.24]Let's do it.
[264:52.86]All day.
[264:54.12]Just a little bit more.
[264:55.04]That's all we need.
[264:55.84]Alright.
[264:56.16]We got it.
[264:57.16]First down.
[264:57.68]30 yards to go.
[265:03.49]And it's intercepted.
[265:05.77]I did my just fucking upgrade hands.
[265:08.27]Is there a reason why it's bouncing out of everybody?
[265:10.53]It has bounced.
[265:13.69]50 of every pass I've thrown this game big series of downs upcoming We just got hands to level three is something wrong with you That's my passing two Just deflate the ball I'm going for it
[265:48.60]Don't let him do the thing that I do.
[265:50.68]Come on, block this.
[265:52.12]You've done it like three times.
[265:53.30]And the extra point is good.
[265:55.06]And so, we're tied.
[266:14.14]Who gets the ball?
[266:15.43]I don't even remember.
[266:18.11]I think they do.
[266:20.25]I think they get the ball.
[266:29.04]It's getting a little hairy here.
[266:43.02]Fuck it.
[266:44.06]Triple coverage.
[266:44.84]To Mim.
[266:45.92]Oh.
[266:49.96]Why do I continue to do this?
[266:52.68]It's not going to matter.
[266:57.57]They're not going to get it.
[266:58.15]It's going to be fine.
[267:02.19]They're not going to get it.
[267:04.53]You can pretend all you want.
[267:10.46]Let's kick it off again.
[267:12.90]What did I have for dinner today?
[267:17.36]I had pork chop.
[267:19.62]It was pretty good.
[267:28.41]It was delicious.
[267:35.50]Hold him here.
[267:36.92]They're gonna have an Unleashed in about 30 seconds.
[267:42.61]I don't want to have to play catch up to stop.
[267:44.40]Smash.
[267:44.78]Out for the whole game.
[267:47.56]Good.
[267:47.80]Yeah, pork chop and a little bit of couscous.
[268:16.74]It was great.
[268:23.27]Don't.
[268:23.59]Hold on.
[268:24.17]Wait.
[268:24.39]What?
[268:25.05]For all you youngsters.
[268:47.56]They didn't really get that much yardage either.
[268:49.72]They didn't get a first down.
[268:51.66]They did here, but... Don't let them get a touchdown.
[268:55.46]Yes, yes.
[268:55.72]They don't have anything.
[268:56.68]They don't have any flash.
[268:59.58]What a fucking blunder that I didn't capitalize on.
[269:05.84]Yes, I did.
[269:08.04]Pump it again.
[269:10.62]There he goes.
[269:15.72]Six games.
[269:16.34]Goodbye.
[269:21.08]Always go for the water balloon.
[269:22.32]Yeah, put some... If you bust their spleen, they're always out for at least three or four games.
[269:27.87]That's the best thing that could have happened.
[269:29.09]Good.
[269:29.55]Yes, it is.
[269:30.49]Touchdown.
[269:54.75]Do that almost ready two more Chug yeah, he's doing the chug again.
[269:58.31]I Wish he would do anything else but chug.
[270:00.83]Oh
[270:33.45]One more, no, two more dirty hits and it's getting right on.
[270:40.43]I'm going to strip that ball, run it back for a touchdown.
[270:48.72]Good.
[271:04.63]The question is, do I let them... Second and 31.
[271:11.00]Hmm.
[271:12.34]We'll see.
[271:12.54]I'm going to stay back.
[271:13.14]I'm not doing a force of fumble right now.
[271:16.72]Third and 22.
[271:21.26]He's still got a long way to go.
[271:33.92]This is where they unravel.
[271:35.12]Check this out.
[271:35.68]It's a guaranteed touchdown.
[271:36.58]I'll just stay ahead.
[272:04.53]They can boo me all they want.
[272:06.05]I'm gonna come away with a victory.
[272:12.98]Easy game.
[272:17.38]Damn, a D1.
[272:19.90]Well, you guys don't have to boo me.
[272:26.90]That's huge.
[272:28.62]What an explosive tackle.
[272:36.42]Did I bet on this?
[272:41.30]I only had to win by like, how much, did I bet?
[272:43.40]I think I did, like 13 grand, right?
[272:53.15]I can't believe I'm gonna beat Blitz the League 2 on stream.
[272:55.93]Add that to things I never thought I was going to do.
[273:31.27]But I love it.
[273:31.81]I'm having a lot of fun.
[273:35.52]It is a classic.
[273:37.54]He's going to pass the guy up here.
[273:39.38]Oh, watch out.
[273:40.58]Puts it up.
[273:42.76]And it's complete at the 48.
[273:44.80]Out of bounds.
[273:45.66]And that'll end this offensive series.
[273:47.51]You can see how pumped up the defense is after that big stop.
[273:50.87]First and 30.
[273:51.39]All the way to 48 yard line.
[273:57.35]And the defender makes sure he doesn't get that one.
[274:01.42]That was really sloppy.
[274:02.70]Not bad.
[274:04.06]That was dumb as hell.
[274:05.49]Yeah, it was.
[274:12.83]Check it.
[274:13.09]Ready?
[274:28.27]Out of bounds.
[274:28.57]Out of bounds.
[274:28.89]Out of bounds.
[274:29.71]Franchise sure can run.
[274:31.81]It's as simple as that.
[274:32.93]He has speed to spare and moves too.
[274:34.95]Right up the middle.
[274:36.67]This offense can smell the end zone.
[274:41.70]Runs it outside.
[274:43.56]Oh, you know what I'm going to do.
[274:52.20]Touchdown.
[274:53.20]Franchise cannot be stopped.
[275:01.35]I love it.
[275:01.95]I love how it worked.
[275:04.87]There's not much you can do against that, though.
[275:07.59]If I'm honest.
[275:09.25]When you only need to go one inch.
[275:10.69]Alright, I'm getting overconfident here.
[275:20.84]I'm going to be 3-0 in Division 1.
[275:31.97]Just too much confidence.
[275:33.35]He's gonna have way too much confidence.
[275:39.29]I'm destroying who are supposed to be the Division 1 champions.
[275:42.55]36-7.
[275:44.55]Good luck.
[276:16.71]I keep forgetting that because I didn't... I wouldn't have... Let's just be assholes.
[276:21.91]Okay, let's do... Special teams.
[276:24.62]Just field goal blocks.
[276:25.54]Fuck it.
[276:25.94]Who cares?
[276:27.26]Right now, like, the offensive coach and the defensive coach are laughing their asses off.
[276:31.40]What arrogance.
[276:48.26]High five and they're shaking hands already.
[276:52.82]This is why you leave this guy back here.
[276:59.74]There's another collarbone for you.
[277:08.99]Collarbone BM.
[277:18.25]And let's end it with a... End of the punt return.
[277:21.63]Fuck it.
[277:25.17]Dragged around and thrown around a tornado.
[277:29.45]I'm trying to do it.
[277:30.87]I haven't unleashed.
[277:32.21]Tried to do the quarterback.
[277:46.26]Rip his ankle off.
[277:47.34]Oh my god.
[277:57.49]That was brutal.
[277:59.83]Here comes more BM.
[278:00.75]You ready?
[278:02.23]Hail Mary.
[278:02.83]Throw it downfield.
[278:03.47]Who cares?
[278:10.37]Lofts one.
[278:14.25]Oh, embarrassing!
[278:16.40]How embarrassing!
[278:20.12]Oh, shit!
[278:21.58]We're good.
[278:22.02]Touchdown.
[278:24.42]You're not giving me the final point?
[278:30.67]Yeah, how could... I gotta kick the extra point.
[278:33.67]That's kind of dumb.
[278:36.87]I got, uh, alpha.
[278:45.84]3-0.
[278:54.69]Two more wins and I'm in the absolute championship.
[279:00.17]The best you could possibly be.
[279:03.95]I'll take that win.
[279:11.53]You serious about wanting to win the championship?
[279:13.91]There's only one way that can happen.
[279:16.17]You and me got to start playing together.
[279:19.76]Not just on the field at the same time, together.
[279:22.70]What's done is done.
[279:27.66]Hey man, I fucked up, alright?
[279:30.14]But if we work tight, we could nail the commissioner and win the title in the process.
[279:36.32]Nail the commissioner?
[279:37.54]Don't you work for him?
[279:39.46]Not anymore.
[279:40.76]Now I just want to bring him down.
[279:43.04]Hard.
[279:45.58]So, we cool?
[279:54.89]They really, really odd body types.
[279:57.49]What's with the shoulders and the stomachs and stuff?
[279:59.65]It's weird.
[280:01.65]I know what it is.
[280:02.37]I'm just kidding.
[280:03.59]Jesus.
[280:03.83]Darling, I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of having your team's training facilities updated.
[280:09.05]That shoddy old equipment was so out of date.
[280:11.75]More equipment?
[280:13.79]There's Bruno.
[280:16.93]Hey, punk.
[280:17.89]How's it hanging?
[280:19.17]Bet you didn't expect to have to deal with me again after you won the Division 2 championship.
[280:24.95]Well, me and the Riot are here to stay.
[280:26.91]Okay, we're against the Riot.
[280:28.36]Franchise must get more sacks than Bruno next game.
[280:31.84]This is versus the LA Riot, okay.
[280:35.12]We've got 350.
[280:36.18]Not enough.
[280:36.76]Anybody injured?
[280:42.21]I don't think I have enough for anything.
[280:43.25]540, 550.
[280:43.81]Why does this have a star on it?
[280:50.38]Strange.
[280:53.70]Uh, juicing.
[280:55.30]It's a high risk.
[280:56.32]We're not going to do it.
[280:59.91]I want to save money, too.
[281:04.25]What did I get?
[281:06.19]12, tackle, break, tackle...
[281:13.69]Alright.
[281:15.39]This is the storyline game.
[281:18.81]The training facility has been upgraded.
[281:20.21]Oh, okay.
[281:24.77]Here we go.
[281:27.41]LA Riot versus the Vegas Super Bowls.
[281:30.57]Go pee?
[281:31.77]I'll pee after this.
[281:35.49]Hmm.
[281:38.21]I'm not betting.
[281:40.78]They're stacked now.
[281:42.78]Alright, I gotta be prepared for this.
[281:53.89]You will lose if you don't pee.
[281:56.62]I wanna pee.
[281:59.42]It's alright.
[282:05.54]We told you to go pee.
[282:10.27]What time is it?
[282:10.77]It's been... five hours?
[282:12.25]Alright.
[282:13.23]Alright, fine, I'll pee.
[282:14.17]Just give me a sec.
[282:16.95]So I gotta get more sacks than Bruno.
[282:20.69]Just let me get one... hold on.
[282:25.33]Go pee or you're gonna be thinking about it all game.
[282:28.33]Yeah, that's true.
[282:31.68]That's why I didn't go pee, because that's a touchdown.
[282:34.46]That's Bruno, right?
[282:39.56]Get off me.
[282:41.55]Alright, I gotta watch out for... I gotta watch out for Bruno.
[282:55.49]Shit!
[282:57.18]I was trying to wait for the guy to get open.
[282:59.18]Fuck, I should've just ran.
[283:00.96]God damn it!
[283:03.54]Should've went fucking P. Oh my god!
[283:08.66]That's way too much.
[283:09.46]I have to punt it.
[283:10.68]This is the first punt I think I've ever done.
[283:21.61]How does it work?
[283:41.97]Why is he running over there?
[283:45.33]Uh... Come on.
[283:50.75]I got it.
[283:52.43]I did it.
[283:52.77]Alright, safety, safety, safety.
[283:58.10]Here comes the safety.
[283:58.82]You gotta get a sac.
[283:59.54]Safety!
[283:59.94]Dammit.
[284:01.38]It's okay.
[284:14.22]I think I don't have a chance for safety.
[284:18.04]How am I supposed to get sacks as a safety?
[284:19.91]I need to get one.
[284:36.82]You still caught it?
[284:39.58]I can't fucking believe it now.
[284:42.55]That's actually unbelievable.
[284:48.29]I smashed him inside and he fell down and he got back up and caught the ball.
[284:56.25]Just infuriated.
[284:58.11]Just blitz every play.
[284:58.83]I have to beat the riot.
[284:59.95]I have to.
[285:08.12]Offense facing a second and goal here.
[285:10.22]Ball at the 33-yard line.
[285:13.46]He's waiting for it.
[285:19.02]Is he bladder wearing down?
[285:25.99]Wait till after the first quarter.
[285:26.97]Second quarter, I mean.
[285:31.09]No, wait till after this game.
[285:32.83]The offense might want to mix it up here.
[285:34.47]They've been a little predictable the first two downs.
[285:47.82]It's always the collarbone.
[285:49.48]Every time.
[285:54.55]Three games going.
[285:55.99]You're up.
[285:56.57]That means you're not going to be there for the championship game if you're there.
[285:58.65]Is he kicking a field goal?
[286:04.55]He ain't gonna get it.
[286:11.34]It's okay.
[286:12.36]Alright, give me this good possession here.
[286:22.03]If you don't pee, I'm gonna take the PlayStation.
[286:35.49]You can't get it.
[286:38.14]It's chained to the desk.
[286:45.13]Just thought that guy was gonna be single coverage.
[286:59.50]Nice play, Sullivan.
[287:02.10]Excellent work.
[287:04.58]Oh, they just can't even touch him.
[287:05.88]Taunt this shit.
[287:06.99]Fill up the meter.
[287:11.78]Nice.
[287:12.04]He's so good.
[287:12.78]I'm so glad he's in the game.
[287:14.76]Um... Let's get the points.
[287:15.60]Turn it over again.
[287:40.85]Get another touchdown.
[287:41.97]It's that simple.
[287:57.46]Collarbone, three, two, one.
[287:59.82]Nope, back.
[288:05.35]Three plays?
[288:06.31]No, that's not... whatever.
[288:07.49]Kind of wasted my meter there, unfortunately.
[288:09.71]It's a loss!
[288:31.07]Can we get Self in the next Jerm or Rumble?
[288:32.55]You don't want Mr. Super Bowl?
[288:33.23]How come you don't want Mr. Super Bowl?
[288:34.35]Almost caught it.
[288:34.81]Kinda went through the hands there.
[288:35.91]Unwelcome.
[288:59.76]Get Robby.
[289:00.36]Robby died.
[289:01.72]Robby's gone.
[289:02.14]You're gonna punt or you're gonna go for it?
[289:12.11]I think you're gonna punt.
[289:13.63]Yes, you are.
[289:14.03]Trying to block the punt.
[289:22.04]I'm an idiot.
[289:25.58]I hate that.
[289:31.15]Uh... Empty.
[289:38.34]Let's do one of these weird ones.
[289:44.58]Got a great halfback.
[289:48.43]I'm telling you.
[289:49.63]I'm telling you.
[289:50.27]The computer... You can't do those weird trick plays against... Maybe you can do it against your friend.
[289:54.23]Not the computer.
[289:54.93]It's not gonna happen.
[289:57.99]Uh... I got like one more play maybe.
[290:12.17]Oh my god, Sullivan, you're the fucking MVP for real.
[290:15.43]Wow.
[290:15.95]Definitely team MVP for sure.
[290:18.03]Not a doubt in my mind now.
[290:38.51]Just blocked it.
[290:39.69]Do I get the ball, too?
[290:40.57]No.
[290:40.63]Well, it's good that I just did that, then.
[290:44.75]Oops.
[290:45.41]It's time to urine?
[290:46.27]Not yet.
[290:46.47]Uh-oh.
[291:07.71]He's going to drop it.
[291:11.65]This is very good.
[291:20.11]We have to pee.
[291:20.71]We have to pee.
[291:23.06]What happened?
[291:23.54]Did you see that?
[291:27.04]Why do they just roll over each other?
[291:28.82]Watch this.
[291:40.93]Oh, it's not enough.
[291:41.61]Oh well.
[291:44.33]I'll take it.
[291:52.19]Get the halfback in there.
[291:54.84]Give it to Sullivan.
[292:01.14]It's just fucking... It took three people to get him down.
[292:06.84]Again, this same play.
[292:08.62]This time it's a touchdown.
[292:16.36]How did that happen?
[292:18.26]I didn't even do that.
[292:19.60]That guy just... He landed on his back.
[292:24.97]How would your balls explode?
[292:31.25]He peed his pants.
[292:32.51]I'll tell you, this is great because storyline-wise, the Riots are definitely going to be in the championship.
[292:41.97]So seeing all these guys go down for more than six games, it's going to be easy.
[293:02.92]When all their starters are down for six games, all they have is the backups.
[293:07.67]I need to injure their star player.
[293:13.33]not this guy they might all just be in there anyways yeah probably first down 30 yards to go see if I can get a sack he left some confused defenders in his wake on that one quite a gallop
[293:45.85]Watch that unleash.
[293:50.46]Who was that?
[293:52.36]Whatever.
[293:59.54]Yeah, we're gonna get one.
[294:06.59]Sprained neck.
[294:09.01]Shortstop.
[294:09.69]Yeah, he's not gonna be playing ball.
[294:11.85]Yeah, he'll be fine.
[294:16.37]Take it easy, buddy.
[294:17.51]It'll be over in a second.
[294:24.53]He's dead?
[294:25.23]No.
[294:26.43]He just... He just, like, did a... Like, a kink in his neck.
[294:39.66]I've gotten pretty good at that.
[294:49.75]Does that count as a sack?
[294:51.23]I don't think it does.
[294:56.56]What?
[295:02.46]Sprained knee.
[295:17.09]I don't even know how that happened.
[295:18.11]He just kind of hopped in there and knocked into my leg.
[295:31.91]Oh, shit.
[295:32.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[295:33.55]I didn't want to do that.
[295:34.17]I wanted to dash forward.
[295:34.73]There's a good chunk of field there, and you can see him getting revved up.
[295:39.26]The offense is looking to strike with just a few yards to go.
[295:42.68]I got an idea.
[295:58.28]Pick it up.
[295:58.64]Should've bet.
[295:59.24]Nah, I gotta save money.
[296:00.18]I have to get at least two or three things to level three before the Super Bowl.
[296:13.32]Because at this rate, I'm definitely gonna get in there.
[296:28.11]Season ending, career ending injury.
[296:30.25]3, 2, 1.
[296:31.33]Not to me, though.
[296:32.29]Thank God.
[296:34.16]Just get right back up.
[296:35.46]Yes.
[296:35.72]Yes.
[296:36.06]Yes.
[296:38.72]Mims is back in.
[297:00.75]Oh, there you are.
[297:01.63]There you go, Mims, coming in after an injury.
[297:06.59]If you scrotum got ruptured, you can never stream ever again.
[297:10.77]Scrotum ruptured.
[297:11.35]Oh, that was embarrassing.
[297:12.13]Hold on.
[297:12.33]No, it wasn't.
[297:12.61]It's fine.
[297:12.99]I know what I'm doing.
[297:32.68]increases their lead take it 34
[298:09.54]I'm sad.
[298:11.54]There is no sequel to this one.
[298:12.72]This is what we get here.
[298:19.20]Elbow.
[298:19.59]Hand.
[298:24.63]Wrist.
[298:30.87]Six games.
[298:31.55]Put them all out of commission.
[298:32.81]All of them.
[298:39.92]Uh, let's do Blitz.
[298:42.95]Need to get a sac.
[298:44.75]Is that kind of a sac?
[298:48.21]Whatever.
[298:49.55]Alright, all absolute chaos Blitz.
[299:11.46]I'm going in for the kill.
[299:16.87]Never mind, I'll just win more points.
[299:19.89]You know what I'm doing.
[299:42.31]the conversion is good works every time as I was coming in today I just the stadium was empty and I just stood in the stands and yelled and I couldn't get new no matter where I stood but you know the yelling felt kind of good you know just to get it out and cry and plumber and soft clips security came to bring me up to the booth I mean it felt good but no echo weird huh
[300:11.77]Why is Jerma's team the color of every 90s birthday party?
[300:15.29]First down and 30.
[300:16.27]Ball at the 28.
[300:18.73]I need to get a sack.
[300:20.01]I need to focus.
[300:20.95]Sack!
[300:22.17]Got it.
[300:22.43]And he's dropped.
[300:23.91]Somebody needs to have a word with that offense.
[300:25.98]Do it again.
[300:26.68]And then I get the victory.
[300:29.50]Just all-out blitz.
[300:30.24]I don't even care if I... I don't care if they score three more touchdowns.
[300:32.76]I need to get one more sack.
[300:35.12]Green A!
[300:53.79]Get some monster yardage on that play there in the red zone now time to capitalize get it Come on, I don't
[301:11.97]I need to sack the quarterback.
[301:13.39]I have an idea.
[301:15.33]Here's the idea, ready?
[301:26.24]Catch it!
[301:26.96]Ugh.
[301:35.82]Punt, punt, punt!
[301:36.70]Punt the ball.
[301:37.80]No, but that's gonna be too long.
[301:46.71]I can't sac!
[301:47.63]I have to immediately get this guy on the ground.
[301:52.11]Just have it be awful.
[301:53.19]No, the game's over.
[301:58.65]Whatever.
[302:00.47]Let's see if I can kill this guy.
[302:08.78]I actually got him?
[302:09.42]How?
[302:13.06]Didn't he get one?
[302:13.78]We both got one.
[302:14.40]Did I get more than one?
[302:18.23]I had to look.
[302:19.67]Alright.
[302:23.99]Make it from the field goal?
[302:24.77]That's possible, yeah.
[302:26.63]Nice.
[302:31.49]New touchdown code.
[302:33.64]Square, circle, triangle, circle.
[302:38.68]Cool.
[302:38.82]Let's go back it up.
[302:49.85]That's like the third time I've embarrassed the LA Riot.
[302:52.48]So prevent Max Carson from getting any sacks, or injure Carson with an unleashed power move next game.
[302:59.90]Okay.
[303:12.09]Shut up.
[303:12.47]Okay, still got that girlfriend.
[303:13.95]Trainer.
[303:14.40]Upgrades.
[303:15.06]This is probably one of the last times I'm going to be able to do this.
[303:18.30]What do you think?
[303:36.37]strength passing break tackle this is so important I would say either passing a break tackle passing passing agility yeah no passing yeah we're gonna do yeah if I have enough money I guess I think I have to play two more games one more game to clinch the playoffs the championship
[304:07.15]I should be able to do it one more time.
[304:11.33]What do we got?
[304:12.12]Keep the money.
[304:12.58]I don't even need it.
[304:14.48]Except maybe... Yeah, too much risk.
[304:15.86]No, don't even do it.
[304:16.44]Don't waste any money.
[304:20.54]Nobody's injured.
[304:21.26]Everyone's good to go.
[304:23.62]Next game against the New York Nightmare.
[304:27.28]And... I will take a piss.
[304:30.56]So everyone can take a piss and relax.
[304:32.72]See you guys in like two minutes.
[306:43.09]Okay.
[306:44.89]Y'all back?
[306:47.82]Did everybody pee?
[306:49.98]I hope so.
[306:53.08]New York nightmare.
[306:53.72]Let's go.
[306:57.39]Win by 19 points.
[306:58.45]No.
[306:58.93]Save money.
[307:02.41]That's a really stacked team.
[307:06.11]New York Nightmares linebacker Max Carson is the second coming of Quentin Sands.
[307:10.33]So hurt this guy.
[307:13.32]Off the field, the comparisons to Sands end.
[307:15.96]Carson keeps to himself.
[307:17.12]That doesn't necessarily fit the New York Nightmares style.
[307:20.20]No fast cars or fast women.
[307:22.34]But the fans aren't complaining.
[307:27.42]Ow!
[307:30.80]Why would you do something like that?
[307:36.75]You're a professional football player.
[307:40.64]You trying to bench yourself for the whole year?
[307:42.98]Don't do that.
[307:43.96]Wear gloves.
[307:52.52]No focus, but they have lots of athleticism.
[307:58.47]He's trying to be cool.
[307:59.25]You just don't understand.
[308:00.85]Alright, I'm going to injure Carson with an Unleash move.
[308:03.63]It sounds like the easiest of all the things to do in this game.
[308:06.67]Here we go.
[308:07.25]They look like the Ravens.
[308:08.28]Yeah, they really do look like the Ravens.
[308:10.02]How am I going to injure him with an Unleash move?
[308:11.80]How the fuck am I going to do that?
[308:20.24]There he is.
[308:31.62]So I have to get on leash and then stop him and hope I break his neck.
[308:36.33]It's gonna be hard.
[308:37.31]Shit.
[308:37.57]Third down.
[308:37.87]Let's go with hop and pop.
[309:02.51]Oh, no, no, no, no!
[309:05.15]Not the hand, not the hand!
[309:09.99]Not the hand.
[309:10.87]That would have been six fucking games.
[309:13.89]Give me a break.
[309:20.27]Worth an eight.
[309:23.16]What would Bill Belichick do?
[309:26.02]He'd go for it.
[309:28.86]Pass, there in his face.
[309:35.09]That's so degrading to me.
[309:40.92]I'm like degraded right now because of that.
[309:44.24]Out again for six fucking games.
[309:48.54]This is very bad.
[309:50.56]This is nothing.
[309:52.26]We might lose to this team.
[309:53.72]Sullivan out on first possession.
[309:57.21]Oh, yeah.
[310:03.44]Sullivan comes in for a game.
[310:05.68]In the first minute of the game.
[310:07.32]Breaks his wrist.
[310:09.04]He's out for two games.
[310:10.58]Comes back in.
[310:11.66]Scores like four touchdowns.
[310:13.84]Breaks his wrist again.
[310:15.62]And is out for like another two games.
[310:25.31]Boy, is he fantastic when he gets to play, bud.
[310:31.15]I don't know how much time he's had on...
[310:34.24]I'm in trouble here.
[310:35.86]They haven't unleashed it.
[310:38.22]No, no tricks.
[311:04.50]Alright, run it.
[311:05.24]Was it Cox?
[311:05.96]You got this.
[311:06.56]Nice.
[311:06.90]He's safe.
[311:07.20]Nice.
[311:32.49]let's do some crucial series of downs here alright yeah I gotta get this touchdown right now right here bingo what is it what was it what was it it is square circle triangle circle the receiver would have had no excuse not to catch that touchdown the quarterback put it right in his hands
[312:13.11]And they draw even with that score.
[312:17.69]Okay.
[312:22.49]I just didn't... How did I ever expect... It's a fucking football game, guys.
[312:25.83]How could I ever expect that was gonna happen?
[312:34.52]Okay.
[312:35.54]So, 7-7, by the way, if anyone's curious.
[312:48.83]And so at the end of one quarter of play we're tied I Wanted to see that what the hell It's alright Square circle triangle circle got it
[313:13.71]I had an opportunity to go for the ass.
[313:17.89]Call of Owen's not... It's all... Three plays.
[313:26.02]That's it.
[313:26.90]Alright.
[313:27.14]I have Unleashed.
[313:29.94]I need to use it on... Also, don't get sacked either.
[313:32.62]That's how I can do it.
[313:33.98]Whoops.
[313:34.28]I just dove.
[313:35.94]Thank God he didn't catch it.
[313:41.45]Is it gonna be a punt?
[313:42.67]Yeah.
[313:44.79]Yeah.
[313:51.76]Alright.
[313:55.24]Unleash.
[313:56.22]Where is he?
[313:57.58]Where is this guy?
[313:58.46]Where's the bad guy?
[314:00.16]I don't know where he is.
[314:02.96]I need to do a run play.
[314:05.18]30 is okay.
[314:08.64]I have to somehow unleash on him.
[314:15.31]I would've had it if he wasn't there.
[314:20.49]I'll do it with myself.
[314:24.07]Here we go.
[314:26.63]No!
[314:27.21]Fucking come on!
[314:31.71]Whatever.
[314:32.69]Alright, just screw it.
[314:36.05]I gotta get a first down here.
[314:39.69]Good.
[314:49.28]That's not a touchdown.
[314:50.30]I stepped in there.
[314:52.10]I stepped in there.
[314:53.14]Look at that foot.
[314:53.72]Look at this foot.
[314:54.22]Left foot is clearly over the line and inside.
[314:55.84]Unbelievable.
[315:22.42]I don't... I don't know what the hell it was.
[315:32.94]Good.
[315:41.83]Solidified my place in the championship game.
[315:44.41]I have to win that Super Bowl.
[315:48.17]That's the... That's the end of the game.
[315:49.71]That means I win.
[315:58.34]Give me some power points here.
[316:04.11]What's my current win-loss?
[316:05.59]10 and 2?
[316:08.71]11 and 2?
[316:08.87]I don't remember.
[316:09.69]12 and 2?
[316:09.87]I'm almost at a full Hearthstone right now.
[316:13.83]I wonder what I'm going to get.
[316:32.10]No, you guys ain't going to Pinwheel.
[316:33.46]I'm not going to get pinwheeled on this one.
[316:36.35]I'm very clearly like 12-2, not 4-9.
[316:39.41]I wouldn't be in Division 1 if I was 4-9.
[316:41.97]Oh, that could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.
[316:50.58]Alright, 3rd and 21.
[316:51.74]Play zones.
[316:52.04]23, zoom!
[316:52.34]They're running!
[317:05.58]Who caught it?
[317:06.14]I thought I caught them.
[317:10.40]It was clearly in my hands.
[317:14.05]What kind of video game you got running here?
[317:19.05]It was in- that was my hands that it touched.
[317:25.48]You got a field goal?
[317:29.24]What the hell?
[317:30.02]Are you faking a field goal right now?
[317:34.35]the field goal is good why would you kick a field goal at first and goal seven seconds left yeah but now I get the ball again and I'm gonna score another touchdown
[318:05.67]Nice touchdown.
[318:07.53]Keep watching.
[318:08.19]He goes way downfield.
[318:17.90]And it's intercepted.
[318:20.86]Don't get a touchdown.
[318:22.02]Don't get a... Oh, my God.
[318:23.78]Please get down.
[318:25.82]And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by four.
[318:30.00]He almost stood back up and I would have screamed.
[318:39.87]Oh my god!
[318:48.54]Do it.
[318:48.84]Do a funny scream.
[318:49.82]No, I don't wanna- I gotta tone down my screaming.
[318:54.14]You fucking gotta be kidding me.
[319:07.97]It's a pass.
[319:08.81]Can I turn my own players up?
[319:09.93]Drop it.
[319:10.23]Drop the ball.
[319:34.01]Yeah, one of my guys fell out of the ceiling.
[319:43.98]He was in position, or he sure was.
[319:45.26]He fell from the stage light.
[319:48.48]I gotta let it get sloppy.
[320:11.38]Football is dumb.
[320:12.14]They run for seven seconds and then fall down.
[320:22.29]The captain is still in the game, too.
[320:23.71]This is bad.
[320:24.13]First down.
[320:25.03]30 yards to go.
[320:25.83]The elbow wins the game.
[320:26.71]Lofts one.
[320:35.87]That was horse shit.
[320:36.87]I don't care.
[320:37.29]Is it a game?
[320:37.61]Six yards.
[320:38.19]Uh...
[321:10.98]Okay.
[321:15.07]No, fuck!
[321:16.85]No, no!
[321:18.31]Don't you taunt me!
[321:20.53]Oh, I'm breaking your neck for next opportunity.
[321:23.43]He like, fucked me up with that stupid fucking thing he said.
[321:43.62]I can't let this one get away.
[321:45.50]It's not out of reach yet.
[321:53.55]Hey, you know what would be great?
[322:02.40]if my halfback didn't get injured every single fucking first quarter.
[322:06.62]No, Cox is going to die too here.
[322:11.28]Oh, what do you know?
[322:12.92]The halfback.
[322:13.69]I wonder what's going to happen to your halfback.
[322:32.83]Bring in like the fucking mailman.
[322:34.79]Sure.
[322:35.55]Third down the list.
[322:36.51]Third and 27.
[322:38.99]I have to make something happen right now.
[323:02.37]I'm going for it.
[323:02.97]Fuck it.
[323:03.87]I'm going for it.
[323:08.34]Secret play that works every time.
[323:16.22]Franchise picks up the first down.
[323:38.55]Oh, this is the back it up one.
[323:48.40]20, 20.
[323:48.44]Alright.
[323:49.40]Are you ready?
[323:51.16]Are you ready?
[323:52.41]It works every time.
[323:57.29]Now we've got a football game.
[324:01.89]As we reach the end of the third quarter, New York leads by a point.
[324:11.40]Whoever gets the next touchdown wins the game.
[324:19.77]Just gonna stop him.
[324:22.27]I got a good meter here.
[324:24.29]What was the blocking there?
[324:27.41]What the fuck was the block?
[324:31.49]Where was the team?
[324:36.45]What the fuck?
[324:38.73]I was out of my control.
[324:39.69]I had control of one guy and everybody... Everyone's dead.
[324:46.99]Alright, I have to... I gotta get the ball back right now.
[324:52.86]Unleash, fumble, pick it up.
[324:54.40]Somebody run it back.
[324:55.60]Really?
[325:00.64]The guy with like 60 fucking percent stamina is not gonna get hit by an unleash.
[325:07.38]Are you gonna stiff arm my unleash?
[325:14.44]No, this clock is not gonna help me here.
[325:17.20]You kick a field goal, I'm screwed.
[325:18.73]Drop it.
[325:19.69]Ugh.
[325:43.87]We gotta do it again.
[325:45.77]Like you do every other time.
[325:46.75]Block it.
[325:49.65]Almost.
[325:50.61]I have to get a touchdown at two point conversion.
[325:57.82]Fucking... Goddamn... Halfback injury.
[326:03.00]I'm so annoyed by that.
[326:12.92]Touchdown.
[326:14.30]Two-point conversion.
[326:15.20]What are those guys trying to pull?
[326:16.86]Why not just get up some automatic?
[326:19.20]First down and 30.
[326:22.80]Jesus, come on.
[326:24.04]What the fuck is the defensive line?
[326:25.40]Really?
[326:25.72]Why are you guys this good?
[326:45.88]You can't win a ball.
[326:46.67]It's alright.
[326:49.87]I'm in the playoffs still.
[326:51.23]I don't care.
[326:52.51]Just perk someone.
[326:54.07]Drop the ball!
[327:18.90]Somebody touches my guy and the ball falls out.
[327:22.98]I break a guy's fucking wrist that has like 45% stamina and you won't even drop the ball.
[327:31.16]Give me this ball back.
[327:33.10]Third and 26, get it.
[327:34.84]Still possible.
[327:44.57]I got a timeout after this play.
[327:47.39]He just can't get a field goal.
[327:51.43]Hurry up and fucking hike the ball.
[327:52.97]Oh, you asshole.
[327:54.41]Why?
[327:54.73]Oh, you idiot.
[327:57.95]He fades back.
[328:11.88]The throw.
[328:15.45]Fuck.
[328:18.64]Fuck that team.
[328:19.34]And fuck my halfback.
[328:20.14]I've had seven doctors working on this guy.
[328:22.38]Every other game.
[328:43.21]I got proposal.
[328:44.73]Circle, square, circle, X. Pay attention to the stamina.
[328:59.80]He's 100% when he starts the game, and he gets injured in the first three plays every time he comes back.
[329:07.52]I've got plenty.
[329:08.86]Have to have you healthy when I'm in town visiting, after all.
[329:11.32]See you soon.
[329:20.37]And I'm going against New England.
[329:21.31]This is gonna be great.
[329:22.31]I gotta win one more game.
[329:23.89]How much money do I have?
[329:25.31]Not enough.
[329:49.01]Oh, just get the whole fucking medical staff on him again.
[329:51.05]Look at this shit.
[330:07.15]I'm going to save the money.
[330:08.75]Alright.
[330:09.37]New England regulators have to win this game or the next one.
[330:15.69]Upgrade the medical facility?
[330:16.79]I mean, it's already done.
[330:20.71]Isn't it already done?
[330:21.33]Yeah, she already did it.
[330:35.36]How am I doing on drugs?
[330:36.44]Let's see.
[330:38.40]Too much risk.
[330:40.78]Now, I gotta take a ton of drugs for the Super Bowl.
[330:43.84]So I'm not taking any drugs.
[330:45.64]None.
[330:45.78]Not even legal ones.
[330:51.27]Win by more than 12 points.
[330:52.65]I'm not gonna do it.
[330:54.13]Alright, let's win this game.
[330:55.83]We got a real test ahead of us.
[330:57.85]The New England Regulars.
[330:59.59]It's tough to throw downfield on these guys because of Pack Rat James.
[331:03.35]Elite Premier Shutdown Club.
[331:13.10]He's also one of the league's premier criminals.
[331:15.94]With 10 arrests and no convictions, he ought to give his all-star trophy to his lawyers.
[331:27.14]Of course they leave the last three teams with a hard one.
[331:39.20]The New England Regulators just won the Super Bowl.
[331:45.76]They have a terrible special teams, but who cares?
[331:54.47]Alright, let's go.
[332:01.63]Come out early and come out swinging.
[332:03.57]Nice job.
[332:09.76]Good thing they're idiots.
[332:24.47]They suck!
[332:25.15]Oh, they don't.
[332:30.07]They're pretty good.
[332:31.95]They have a great offense.
[332:38.49]But I knew what play they were doing.
[332:46.84]Welcome to Vegas.
[332:49.19]Gotta play dirty?
[332:50.75]Once I build enough meter, you better believe it.
[332:56.08]Just rip his head off.
[332:57.12]There it is.
[333:02.70]Right at the start of the game.
[333:07.98]That was like a fucking pie.
[333:10.30]Floating through the air.
[333:11.98]And my... I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying.
[333:15.87]It's hard for me to talk and play games like this.
[333:27.88]It's like a pie.
[333:28.50]It's like the pie on the windowsill.
[333:31.26]And I'm in a cartoon and I'm smelling the pie air.
[333:34.16]And I'm floating by.
[333:35.10]I don't even know what the fuck that means.
[333:37.00]First down.
[333:42.90]Who needs some of them when you got pucks?
[334:01.98]What's a new one?
[334:02.40]Let's see.
[334:02.78]New, new, new, new, new.
[334:03.68]What's a new one?
[334:07.12]Uh, proposal.
[334:08.46]Circle, square, circle X. She said yes!
[334:12.82]Why are all these unlockables not very good?
[334:34.78]That one is approved by the terms of service, yes it is.
[334:38.32]That's great.
[334:45.57]Back it up next time.
[334:57.36]Vinny is hosting you for five minutes.
[334:59.28]We gotta fucking make something gross happen then.
[335:11.32]And there we go.
[335:18.84]First down and 30.
[335:19.82]That was, in fact, gross.
[335:24.64]Hey, you know what?
[335:28.01]Why don't we take a look at another one?
[335:36.97]Bon appetit.
[335:41.95]Oh, what's that?
[335:46.41]Vinny's doing a... Vinny's doing like a let's eat food stream and everybody like brought food to the stream?
[335:52.05]Sorry.
[335:52.71]I didn't know.
[335:53.72]I'm so sorry.
[336:09.34]I don't fucking understand.
[336:14.66]Get it and fucking make him drop the ball!
[336:18.30]Fumble!
[336:18.56]What is this shit?
[336:31.21]Okay.
[336:32.03]He catches the ball.
[336:33.61]This guy on the left.
[336:34.58]51 thought he caught it.
[336:36.24]He's pretending to catch it for some reason.
[336:38.78]81 then runs into 26 who falls down.
[336:41.12]36 then cannot drag him down to the ground.
[336:46.86]And he makes it out.
[336:47.87]Four people just acted like idiots.
[336:52.49]Unbelievable.
[336:58.03]That was like five toddlers versus The Rock.
[337:02.48]I just killed somebody.
[337:03.60]Who did I just kill?
[337:08.47]I've snapped somebody's neck here.
[337:14.61]How do you even flip like that?
[337:15.97]Nice three musketeers joke.
[337:24.96]The three musketeers?
[337:28.04]Like the fucking candy?
[337:37.88]Get up there.
[337:48.49]I know Steve Martin, Martin Short, I know what that movie is.
[337:51.31]No, that's just Three Amigos.
[337:57.82]Whatever.
[337:58.66]Oops.
[337:59.03]Will you- You can still get it.
[338:00.53]You can still get it.
[338:01.23]We're good.
[338:29.47]Do I stay?
[338:30.51]No, just stay ahead.
[338:43.24]Default dance touchdown celebration?
[338:47.46]That technically is a default dance, so you're not wrong.
[338:52.21]This is the guy that beat the Super Bowl on stream.
[338:54.23]Not yet.
[339:00.82]It's not even the end of the first quarter, and there's already this many.
[339:03.66]Interesting.
[339:04.18]Okay.
[339:06.72]F?
[339:07.06]F?
[339:07.24]What's going on?
[339:08.34]Why are we F-ing?
[339:11.42]Oh, actual Cox problem.
[339:13.11]Okay.
[339:13.41]Was it third down?
[339:15.83]Second down?
[339:29.44]Oh, they're just messing around with me?
[339:31.10]Okay.
[339:36.58]I'm doing a lot of good stamina drains here, too.
[339:41.39]Just keep playing smart.
[339:43.39]And then it doesn't matter if I lose the next game.
[339:44.83]Third down.
[339:45.59]Sack.
[339:45.77]Sack.
[339:46.07]SACK!
[339:46.73]And...
[340:11.06]See ya.
[340:14.34]Now that should solidify a win, I think.
[340:25.37]Speaking of see ya, I think Vinny started his stream.
[340:30.13]Right after that one.
[340:31.01]Oh fuck, I gotta get this, I gotta get this punt!
[340:37.96]No, that's me.
[340:40.57]Oh no, wait a minute.
[340:41.33]Is that going to end the season?
[340:48.33]Broken forearm?
[340:49.61]Mr. Super Bowl.
[340:51.23]I think it's broken.
[340:52.63]Easy, easy.
[340:53.59]Hold it steady.
[340:56.63]Easy, easy.
[340:57.57]Hold it steady.
[340:59.51]Only two plays and he's got a seven stamina boost.
[341:03.15]No career ruined.
[341:05.53]You're going to the bench.
[341:06.29]Let's go.
[341:08.93]That could have just ended the career.
[341:11.80]Who's the quarterback?
[341:13.50]Number 12?
[341:13.76]Guillaute?
[341:14.38]That's pretty good.
[341:18.70]He's pretty good.
[341:19.56]I just thought they should have named him Fluffy Lump.
[341:25.60]Or George.
[341:39.41]Nice, Mims.
[341:40.01]Beautiful catch.
[341:44.58]That's a first down.
[341:45.36]I'm gonna go with... Get into the halfback.
[341:50.88]Okay, I'm back in.
[341:51.52]Don't worry.
[341:53.67]Super Bowl back in.
[341:56.79]Well, that's the only time you're ever gonna see... Yellow.
[342:07.35]I'll take it.
[342:07.93]No, I don't know.
[342:08.53]You know what I'm doing.
[342:09.49]What's the new one?
[342:10.45]Proposal, uh, pylon kick.
[342:13.43]Meh.
[342:13.59]Oh yeah!
[342:45.54]Don't do the chug anymore that I'm superstitious When I do the chug
[343:07.16]I'm not gonna get, like, another Prilosec ad Bring back Madden.
[343:18.28]Bring back Madden.
[343:18.94]Maybe in a minute
[343:32.19]Alright, we're getting a little Unleash here.
[343:33.37]Let's go with Prevention, Defense.
[343:38.50]Sounds pretty good.
[343:40.66]Sack.
[343:42.04]Kill other quarterback.
[343:45.94]We got it.
[343:46.38]Me or him.
[343:49.83]That was their star player, right?
[343:55.27]Oh, we both activated the Unleash at the same time?
[344:02.03]Throw it down.
[344:10.96]It's a run.
[344:16.22]It's going to be a pass.
[344:17.50]It's the opposite of what they say every time.
[344:32.37]Bring back Matt and bring 4th and 10.
[344:33.69]What do you think, they're gonna go for it?
[344:36.33]No, they're not.
[344:43.44]Alright, I got one chance here.
[344:51.67]Damn it.
[344:52.05]Oh well.
[344:58.88]21-7.
[345:00.60]Going good so far.
[345:02.34]I'll get out.
[345:02.78]I'll bring him back.
[345:03.44]I'll bring him back.
[345:15.65]Get behind your blockers.
[345:18.40]That's how you take care of that.
[345:21.32]Oh.
[345:24.76]Why is Mims so slow?
[345:26.74]Oh no!
[345:27.86]Please tell me that wasn't his knee.
[345:31.66]Knee.
[345:39.72]They all went just on top of me there.
[345:43.66]Let's go with... Oh, we got a guy open there!
[345:52.00]Excuse me!
[345:54.71]Oh, excuse me.
[345:57.38]Nobody can stop me first down.
[345:58.58]And tackled close to a first down.
[346:01.63]No first down.
[346:03.12]Really.
[346:12.72]We are going to the real Super Bowl in this game I Can actually just solidify this it don't matter what happens What is Madden doing back
[346:42.06]By popular demand, it brought him back.
[346:49.67]It was almost a ride in here.
[346:50.57]Yeah, that's the game.
[346:53.57]You know, let's just make it a guaranteed play that works every time.
[347:11.72]Oops.
[347:12.16]I did it a little too early.
[347:14.70]It was a guaranteed play.
[347:15.56]I just messed it up.
[347:17.04]He's coming across right now.
[347:37.79]Still in the third quarter.
[347:42.88]The offense looking at first and 30.
[347:44.82]Ball at the 27 yard line.
[347:46.88]Wrong guy?
[347:47.46]They're all on the same team.
[347:49.88]It means they're all the enemy.
[347:55.46]45's it!
[347:55.84]It's a run!
[347:56.28]45's it!
[347:56.48]Straight in.
[348:07.70]Are there rugby games that are like this?
[348:19.23]I don't think so.
[348:20.15]I think I've only ever heard of one rugby game.
[348:24.83]And wasn't it like an indie game?
[348:25.91]I don't remember one releasing.
[348:27.58]Maybe they did.
[348:31.51]Are they in a field goal?
[348:32.59]No, they're going for it.
[348:33.67]Oops.
[348:33.80]Well, keep that one guy back there.
[348:34.96]Guys.
[348:35.08]Guys.
[348:35.26]Good thing you're back here.
[349:00.14]He's leveled at the 25-yard line.
[349:02.77]Good job churning out those yards.
[349:04.55]The ground attack looked formidable on that play.
[349:07.07]As we reach the end of the third quarter, Las Vegas leads by 27.
[349:10.67]I can't believe that shit.
[349:16.58]The quarterback just walked through the whole team.
[349:21.38]Here we go again.
[349:22.58]You didn't catch that fucking ball.
[349:34.50]Let me see that again.
[349:46.14]I hit the ground.
[349:49.03]It actually bounced off the ground.
[349:51.85]I'm just angry field goal blocking right now.
[349:54.09]It's not what I should be doing, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[349:58.67]End zone.
[349:59.99]Picked on.
[350:05.71]When you're behind and turn the ball over like that, it doesn't do much for your team's mental state.
[350:10.45]Alright, get it out of here.
[350:11.45]First down and 30.
[350:12.41]Nice catch, Kenny.
[350:16.29]If I can get one more, I'm going to give him one more.
[350:32.74]This is almost a game.
[350:34.06]How are you scooping these up so well?
[351:01.81]Las Vegas has the football.
[351:06.57]This game is fucking wacky.
[351:10.02]Who cares?
[351:10.54]Throw it in the end zone.
[351:19.08]Launches it.
[351:33.19]It worked.
[351:43.64]Yeah.
[351:47.52]Let's try to... Let's rub it in.
[351:49.44]Now it's a good number.
[351:54.49]Well, I was scared of New England for some reason.
[351:57.19]I got destroyed by New York.
[352:00.62]You can still lose this.
[352:01.84]No, it's not physically possible to lose this.
[352:07.95]Oh, man.
[352:08.61]It's a read.
[352:11.43]What was that?
[352:17.46]No, I cannot lose this.
[352:19.30]You can play onside kick recovery three times.
[352:27.91]They're a good team.
[352:28.69]Whoa.
[352:30.07]Look, their stats were great, and they're one of the Division I leaders.
[352:34.58]Watch the motion.
[352:35.50]I'm just going by what I see.
[352:40.58]And the quarterback goes down hard.
[352:42.78]He does that game in and game out.
[352:44.50]Just consistent, great play.
[352:46.04]I mean, I have watched this game a long time, and he's got to be in the top 200 or 300 players I've ever seen.
[352:52.98]Well, at least that I can remember.
[352:56.09]Top 300 players.
[352:58.91]That one was funny.
[353:06.76]Turn it over.
[353:12.66]Now we rub it in.
[353:14.91]Guys, imagine that this is the Super Bowl that you just saw.
[353:17.69]Wouldn't you just have loved if you could just do this to New England and be like, fuck you.
[353:23.37]Like, fuck you, loser.
[353:32.97]More bully.
[353:33.35]More bully.
[353:34.13]Finally.
[353:34.87]A little bit more.
[353:35.69]That's all we need.
[353:36.45]Alright.
[353:36.83]We got it.
[353:53.22]And that one's off the mark.
[353:54.64]Aw.
[353:58.32]First and 30.
[353:59.95]That's what would happen if I got up there.
[354:01.38]I probably could do a better job than that, actually.
[354:08.67]No, I want more.
[354:10.71]Time out, Nguyen.
[354:11.61]Time out, Las Vegas.
[354:21.45]No, I'm trying to hurry.
[354:22.95]Sorry.
[354:23.53]Defeat the New England Regulators in campaign mode.
[354:26.24]Did I bet on this one?
[354:27.16]That's a lot of clash moves, Dan.
[354:28.82]Alright.
[354:50.44]Devastator Pads, new sponsor.
[354:52.24]And here comes the final game of the season, I believe.
[355:03.81]Yeah, I already, already gonna be in the championship.
[355:06.17]French, I love you.
[355:07.59]Have I told you I loved you recently?
[355:09.55]Grace just dumped her old agent and signed with yours truly.
[355:12.91]Whatever you're doing to make her happy, keep doing it.
[355:18.52]There's Quentin.
[355:19.50]Really?
[355:19.74]Let's see.
[355:20.98]Those are pretty good.
[355:52.48]So what are we putting the final point in, I think?
[355:56.97]I've got enough for one more.
[355:59.21]Agility, Strength, Break Tackle, or Tackle.
[356:13.88]Drugs.
[356:16.30]Break Tackle.
[356:18.46]Break Tackle.
[356:20.18]I might have enough for one more after this last game.
[356:25.01]Versus the Vancouver Beavers.
[356:28.98]I'm not going to spend any money.
[356:30.12]We're good.
[356:35.48]Do every drug.
[356:36.38]No, no, no.
[356:37.04]No drugs at all.
[356:37.74]Because then the championship game I can take all of them.
[356:46.68]So I've already solidified the championship game.
[356:51.74]Five and one.
[356:55.86]So here's the plan.
[356:56.76]It doesn't matter.
[356:57.44]This game doesn't matter.
[356:58.02]I'm going to
[357:27.36]Just play like an asshole.
[357:31.70]I'm not going to get anybody hurt.
[357:34.60]None of my teammates are going to get hurt.
[357:36.58]They all should be back.
[357:40.04]I'm going to throw the game.
[357:41.00]I don't care if we lose.
[357:41.92]Because I'm already in the Super Bowl.
[357:49.80]Winning does, yes, winning does get you more money.
[357:52.84]Good evening, everyone.
[357:53.74]You're right.
[357:56.55]Snowy... Why would the... What were the cheerleaders running out of the field for?
[358:03.56]Snowy Vancouver!
[358:14.97]It's alright.
[358:22.89]If you lose Sullivan, you won't have him for the final game.
[358:25.01]That's why I'm not gonna even do one play.
[358:29.73]Sullivan is not gonna get the ball once.
[358:43.35]It actually did snow in Vancouver on...
[358:47.70]The captain comes through for this team once again.
[358:50.26]He's going to run it over and over again.
[358:53.98]That's not a bad idea.
[359:01.71]Anybody ever questions this guy's leadership, they can just look to a play like that.
[359:06.99]Fifth play of the drive.
[359:15.33]Okay gives the fans exactly what they came to see right there Even those who root for the other team will admit that this guy brings excitement to the game They're in the red zone now time to capitalize Full line touchdown Let's just do that every single play Why even play the game normally
[359:44.19]Six hours in and you're going to spam the same?
[359:45.73]Because I don't have to worry about it.
[359:47.69]Let's do it again.
[359:56.12]I found the meta.
[360:02.10]This would be a really lame game to watch.
[360:04.32]That was almost very bad.
[360:13.52]Imagine that worked.
[360:19.78]I gotta rupture his spleen.
[360:21.00]If I'm not careful, I'll get my own spleen ruptured.
[360:23.24]That would be bad.
[360:26.10]Super Bowl might get a fractured skull.
[360:36.07]Now, I'm not gonna get a career-ending injury.
[360:37.67]I just need to be above by more than 5 to 10 points.
[360:41.95]It's all that matters.
[360:42.65]Is it third down?
[360:52.00]Third and 13.
[360:52.30]Turn it over.
[360:53.06]He kind of froze up there in the middle.
[361:06.89]Here comes a punt.
[361:08.87]Field goal.
[361:09.45]You're not going to get it.
[361:11.07]Look at that wind.
[361:15.39]That's stuff on own teammates, yo.
[361:20.58]Somehow.
[361:24.30]It's all good.
[361:34.05]Really?
[361:34.27]I thought I had you.
[361:36.39]Usually that slow-mo stiff arm can just stuff into people.
[361:47.54]Uh-oh.
[361:48.94]Who's that?
[361:50.62]It's alright.
[361:51.18]They don't matter.
[361:51.62]82.
[361:53.46]28's the one that matters.
[361:54.60]So if your main dude gets badly injured, is it legit just game over?
[361:57.08]Uh, it is.
[362:06.55]Your save file does not get deleted.
[362:09.12]But you have to go back to your last save.
[362:14.36]What the hell were you doing?
[362:18.26]No, Sullivan doesn't... I don't want Sullivan to have the ball.
[362:24.67]That was freaking me out.
[362:25.41]What the hell were you doing?
[362:27.31]I mean, you're...
[362:37.04]That's how you do it.
[362:42.20]X was touchdown.
[362:44.00]You don't know that.
[362:44.68]This is the prison all over again.
[362:49.19]Second and goal.
[363:06.14]The whole team is here.
[363:10.32]And he's in the end zone.
[363:11.44]That was unbelievable.
[363:12.56]Las Vegas now leads by 11.
[363:24.53]And the conversion is good.
[363:25.85]Very good.
[363:38.74]I can unleash someone if I can strip it.
[363:46.72]I hate this.
[363:54.00]QB sneaking to the right episode.
[363:58.09]Here comes an injury.
[364:00.41]On the collarbone.
[364:01.59]Oh well.
[364:18.78]Wow.
[364:20.42]I'm surprised I didn't get that back.
[364:22.72]With under 30 seconds to play in the first half, Las Vegas leads by 13.
[364:26.89]What down?
[364:34.25]I'll take that ball back.
[364:41.07]He breaks his fucking collarbone.
[364:45.69]Kick it.
[364:47.10]Kick.
[364:49.54]Do it again.
[364:50.74]Give me that ball.
[364:53.94]What are you going for?
[365:00.47]I can't wait for the championship game.
[365:02.43]I'm gonna be so amped up for it And I ain't gonna let up either
[365:29.99]Even if I'm up by like 60 points, I'm still gonna play as hard as I can.
[365:47.73]We just can't string anything together.
[365:50.39]They keep going for the same run.
[365:51.55]Don't you know I am the only one that can do that?
[365:54.54]Maybe if you did your quarterback to do the same diaper run to the right, it would work.
[365:59.10]It doesn't work.
[366:00.22]It's not going to happen.
[366:04.60]I'm sorry.
[366:05.52]It's not going to.
[366:06.17]Somebody get him.
[366:08.23]Good.
[366:25.23]4th and 31.
[366:26.01]Is it a field goal?
[366:27.15]No, did they have to punt it?
[366:28.51]Yeah.
[366:30.53]It's not the turnoff.
[366:37.12]Good field position, too.
[366:44.93]For some reason, I thought he was going to dive.
[366:46.17]I was going to try to jump over him.
[366:48.89]First down and 30.
[366:58.91]Fundamentals.
[366:59.49]Just keep the clock going.
[367:00.33]They got an unleash.
[367:01.23]Not yet.
[367:03.27]Second down and quite a ways to go.
[367:05.05]Fuck it.
[367:05.29]I'm going to the right.
[367:06.75]Check this.
[367:09.55]He just left the right wide open.
[367:13.88]Vancouver just looks weak against the run.
[367:16.58]That means the offense is at their leisure to chew up yards and the clock.
[367:23.84]First and goal.
[367:24.68]It's gut check time.
[367:26.04]Ball at the 20-yard line.
[367:32.48]Right back to him.
[367:33.90]It's okay Let the timer up And so with three quarters gone Las Vegas this quarterback doesn't understand the pocket I
[368:02.11]No, I don't you're right third down and I really don't I can't have 23 points.
[368:09.01]I don't like that number 73
[368:35.06]I'm not having the devil's number.
[368:43.81]It's bad luck.
[368:48.09]I'll get it back right now.
[368:53.91]Still held onto it, though, somehow.
[368:56.22]Alright.
[369:00.96]Last quarter.
[369:08.06]and it's intercepted that turnover just adds to this team's long list 100 guaranteed I don't see how they're going to turn it around at this point big series of downs upcoming ball at the 17 yard line sir this game doesn't matter such an amazing game
[369:36.77]The next one sure does.
[369:42.65]What?
[369:44.23]Where did I even end up?
[369:50.70]Fuck it, whatever.
[369:51.26]Guaranteed win, Ryder.
[369:53.08]Three, two, one.
[369:54.34]Mm, mm, mm, mm.
[370:06.91]He's going the wrong way.
[370:08.05]28's good.
[370:12.33]Let's get 30.
[370:20.90]See, now... It's just a question of building up some tackles for more money.
[370:42.24]Like this.
[370:49.50]I'm gonna throw the game.
[370:50.80]I know, I did say that.
[370:51.79]Oh, going all out.
[370:52.49]Blitz.
[370:52.71]Try to murder the quarterback.
[370:58.73]That sounds like a plan.
[371:00.09]What?
[371:10.36]Um, that's not, he's knocked down, apparently.
[371:12.46]Somehow, he's dead.
[371:16.78]This could be six.
[371:20.38]Vancouver covers it up.
[371:24.63]Touchdown, Beavers.
[371:26.51]Oh, that was really dumb.
[371:32.71]Fucking Tom and Jerry, that shit.
[371:37.51]The conversion is good.
[371:41.21]Dude, what the hell kind of route were you running there?
[371:47.31]It's alright.
[371:48.35]Onside kick that we need to get.
[371:52.45]Who cares?
[371:52.93]Oh my god.
[371:54.77]That was brutal.
[371:56.63]But I still got it.
[371:59.40]Listen.
[371:59.90]First and 30.
[372:00.44]Ball at the 40-yard mark.
[372:06.44]He fell.
[372:11.77]Alright, let's run.
[372:13.73]We're just gonna gently run the ball.
[372:19.35]Don't get hurt.
[372:19.93]Alright, he has no more timeouts.
[372:24.52]Everyone's gonna think I'm an asshole for this.
[372:25.92]You're gonna think I'm fucking crazy.
[372:30.32]Oops.
[372:50.83]He takes it inside.
[373:04.96]I win.
[373:06.30]No, don't.
[373:08.92]Oh, thank god, my heart.
[373:09.92]Oh, by mercy, he laid him out.
[373:12.54]And as time expires, Las Vegas wins the game.
[373:14.98]Oh, if I had something like a shattered wrist again, I would fucking be so mad.
[373:21.59]OK.
[373:24.57]On to the Super Bowl.
[373:28.61]Imagine seeing that in a real game.
[373:36.31]That's an absolute fine from the NFL, right?
[373:39.87]That's like a $100,000 fine, at least.
[373:46.59]Alright.
[373:47.41]We are at the endgame here.
[373:53.90]Delaying the game?
[373:54.38]I think it would be unsportsmanlike conduct.
[373:57.34]No, I was talking to Miller about that yesterday.
[373:59.76]The Bearcats can't trade up.
[374:02.42]They don't have cap room.
[374:14.63]Excuse me.
[374:17.88]What the hell are you doing here?
[374:19.08]I got some information you're going to want to hear.
[374:21.32]Make it quick.
[374:23.42]First, I want a new deal.
[374:25.10]You're going to approve my trade to the L.A.
[374:26.72]Riot next season.
[374:27.76]Then why should I do anything more for you?
[374:29.76]Man, fuck you.
[374:30.98]I planted your drugs.
[374:32.43]Not my fault you couldn't keep Franchise locked up.
[374:36.51]This better be damn good.
[374:38.15]It's money, baby.
[374:39.97]Our boy Franchise ruptured his Achilles during practice yesterday.
[374:44.12]Coaches and trainers are keeping it real quiet.
[374:46.56]Don't want the Riot to know that our superstar is riding the bench this Sunday.
[374:51.81]You just earned your trade.
[374:53.53]Miss a few key tackles Sunday and I'll make you the Riot's team captain.
[374:57.47]So the sabotage.
[374:58.76]Another sabotage.
[375:03.92]So he's gonna purposely miss tackles.
[375:05.14]Oh, no, he's getting it recorded.
[375:06.60]MVP of the league.
[375:07.48]Division 1.
[375:07.76]12 touchdowns, 12 58 yards.
[375:08.52]Me.
[375:31.93]Grace's final betrayal.
[375:33.07]This is gonna be bad.
[375:52.97]Avoid getting dirty hit by Bruno.
[375:54.65]That's gonna be really hard.
[375:55.35]I don't think I have enough money for anything.
[375:57.97]Nope, we just gotta go buy on drugs alone.
[376:00.07]At risk.
[376:24.12]Immune to injury.
[376:25.92]You know who I'm giving that to.
[376:28.13]Whoops.
[376:28.61]No, go back.
[376:29.29]I didn't want to do that.
[376:30.57]No, I just gave him, like, fucking Tylenol.
[376:34.52]I wanted to give him the immunity thing.
[377:00.91]That's annoying.
[377:01.45]Alright.
[377:07.03]Reload the game?
[377:07.77]No, I'm fine.
[377:08.99]I'll be fine.
[377:10.97]Championship Super Bowlers earn the Super Bowl.
[377:13.19]Mr. Super Bowl makes his final actual appearance.
[377:15.75]I can't say if it's coming.
[377:17.83]Let's go.
[377:19.92]Bet everything I have.
[377:35.03]Here comes the World Championship.
[377:41.06]We're using all forms of horseshit.
[377:45.80]Every dirty play.
[377:47.34]Every bullshit maneuver.
[377:49.24]I'm going to play as hard as I can.
[377:52.04]I'm going to try to get 75 points.
[377:56.21]We're about to kick off the Division 1 Championship and the two of us couldn't be more excited.
[378:00.95]Partner?
[378:01.69]Yeah, this should be a heck of a game.
[378:02.87]I mean, I'm fired up.
[378:04.27]I mean, I'm really excited because this stadium has great hot dogs.
[378:07.68]I mean, I got a great seat, a cool soda in one hand.
[378:11.28]Here comes the Super Bowl.
[378:12.46]I'm ready for some football.
[378:14.88]Oh, excuse me.
[378:15.60]Oh, come on.
[378:18.24]I was going to stiff arm him to get him away from me.
[378:22.27]I'm restarting the game.
[378:27.52]Made up for it.
[378:30.04]75 points, I'm going for it.
[378:34.47]No.
[378:38.75]7 points, take it.
[379:06.33]Get angry.
[379:07.55]Get angry.
[379:08.91]Throw more people down.
[379:09.95]Do it.
[379:10.25]Don't even give him a chance.
[379:17.68]Instantly injure someone.
[379:19.02]Instant injure.
[379:19.62]Here it comes.
[379:32.23]That's a fucking kickoff, man.
[379:36.19]Doesn't matter.
[379:36.61]I'm fine.
[379:37.49]They're not going to score, right?
[379:40.43]Watch this.
[379:41.57]I'm knocking it out of his hands right now.
[379:46.61]Destroyed.
[379:48.41]That's... That was not his head.
[379:50.98]Apparently, that's what his head looks like.
[379:53.98]And that was one of their best players.
[379:55.64]That's their halfback.
[380:01.60]That's going to set him back a long ways.
[380:03.24]Third and goal.
[380:06.64]What are we going to do?
[380:09.06]Third down and goal.
[380:30.60]Fourth and goal.
[380:31.48]They're only going to get three points.
[380:33.18]If they even get it.
[380:34.04]That's how you play defense in the fucking goddamn Super Bowl.
[380:39.15]Let's line up like everybody over here.
[380:46.62]Almost booked.
[380:56.14]Why don't they just do that?
[380:58.02]Just put all, like, 10 players on the right side and just run at the same time.
[381:01.84]Not that hard.
[381:05.22]He's trying to dive.
[381:08.30]This guy gets me every time.
[381:11.54]Fuck.
[381:19.68]Just put all the players on one side, that's what I'm saying.
[381:27.76]I'm going left side.
[381:32.86]Catch it.
[381:33.52]Catch it.
[381:34.05]I'm gonna run.
[381:38.59]Third down.
[381:41.05]I gotta make this.
[381:41.77]Make it happen.
[381:42.17]Come on.
[381:47.32]Get across that plane.
[381:48.50]Get across that plane.
[381:49.60]That's the Sullivan I know.
[381:52.56]Still in the game after the first play Still up Do it again Get the ball to Sullivan Easy run across Go across the plate.
[381:57.54]No, it's okay
[382:19.65]And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by four.
[382:23.35]Is he going to complete the game tonight?
[382:25.33]You're looking at it right now.
[382:26.91]This is the Super Bowl.
[382:30.27]Vegas versus LA.
[382:36.08]Why is everybody laughing?
[382:38.54]Why is everybody laughing?
[382:39.50]What happened?
[382:51.49]75 points, I told you.
[382:53.11]That's the real Super Bowl.
[382:54.89]I've beaten the Riot.
[382:55.59]Like three or four times in a row.
[382:56.65]They don't scare me.
[382:57.19]At all.
[383:23.00]Injury.
[383:23.78]Incoming.
[383:24.30]Oops.
[383:26.27]Did we get SpongeBob at the halftime show?
[383:36.07]Yeah.
[383:36.75]I'll have SpongeBob start his act.
[383:39.79]And then I'll delete the screen.
[383:42.97]He'll be on screen for like three seconds.
[383:44.47]Check this out.
[383:51.61]That's not a fumble, somehow.
[383:52.93]Just like in the real Super Bowl.
[383:53.94]That's right.
[383:54.24]Second and 11.
[383:54.54]I'm going to stay back.
[383:56.06]There it is.
[383:57.06]Las Vegas makes the recovery.
[384:24.49]I didn't get a point?
[384:25.81]Come on, give me a point.
[384:26.55]We're gonna do something different.
[384:28.43]No beer chugging.
[384:29.11]No, just be smart.
[384:30.09]It's only the second quarter.
[384:31.11]There's still potential.
[384:32.61]Oops.
[384:51.80]Keep thinking those are fumbles
[385:19.75]You aren't on pace to hit 75 this game.
[385:24.43]Not really.
[385:25.01]Maybe like 40.
[385:26.44]I'll say that now.
[385:27.30]But, here we go.
[385:28.12]What do you say when life hands you a lemon, you do what?
[385:57.79]Looking like I'm gonna win the Super Bowl here This is gonna turn into a blowout I think And the extra point is good
[386:27.84]What is this guy's name?
[386:29.87]Have they even said his name?
[386:37.13]They don't refer to him as anything.
[386:38.55]It's just other guy.
[386:41.07]They're pretty far back though.
[387:00.84]John Madden.
[387:05.40]I'm not gonna lie, I just switched character and hit dive.
[387:13.91]Over and over again.
[387:18.09]No BM.
[387:18.61]What am I doing?
[387:21.95]Just make it happen.
[387:22.63]No BM.
[387:23.07]Why are they using a timeout?
[387:29.67]No timeout.
[387:30.81]2-22.
[387:30.89]This is the Super Bowl.
[387:32.39]How do you make that mistake?
[387:33.11]And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 25. .
[387:57.96]That's it.
[388:26.79]You're still better than the actual Super Bowl one.
[388:56.84]That was, that's what they did at the Super Bowl.
[388:59.62]I'm just risk creating this.
[389:05.95]Alright, now play it for real.
[389:07.81]Okay, fine.
[389:08.65]You know what?
[389:09.95]Fucking play it during the game.
[389:14.77]No, I don't want it on the halftime show.
[389:16.19]I want it to be playing while I'm trying to win the game.
[389:19.19]I don't know why they didn't do that.
[389:29.50]You gotta wonder what he's thinking in the middle of a run like that.
[389:48.54]Turn this shit off.
[389:52.02]It's gonna match.
[389:59.77]Oh!
[391:03.14]And there it is.
[391:04.68]It's autoplay.
[391:14.12]Man, that puts it away.
[391:20.02]That's game over.
[391:21.20]Who gives a shit?
[391:21.78]I'm gonna throw the ball in the end zone every play.
[391:24.97]I'm gonna be the most hated team in the league.
[391:35.19]Three.
[391:36.13]And the conversion is good.
[391:41.67]Punt every possession.
[391:44.92]Okay.
[391:45.74]No, that sucks.
[391:46.76]That, alright, that actually, I'm, I'm, yeah, sure.
[392:03.85]Go for 75.
[392:04.83]I'm going to blitz every play.
[392:10.63]75 to 3.
[392:11.05]You know what?
[392:11.55]I'll try.
[392:12.43]I can still get that.
[392:17.15]Damn it.
[392:18.98]Worth a shot.
[392:25.78]Field goal block every play.
[392:28.32]You know, I'll give you a little story.
[392:31.77]Back when Madden was really, really popular, my brother used to want to play against me all the time.
[392:39.04]He was a huge fan.
[392:40.60]I didn't know what the hell was going on.
[392:41.66]I was probably like 12.
[392:43.50]So my older brother was a big fan of Madden, and he would always want to play with me because who else are you going to play with?
[392:50.19]He would have some friends over sometimes.
[392:51.63]But anyways, so I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.
[392:55.75]So I just did field goal block every play.
[392:59.03]And I'm not kidding, he would just do pass plays and cool runs and stuff like that.
[393:05.40]And it would end up being like 120 to 0.
[393:09.34]Because I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[393:16.55]Yes, it would be over 100 something points each game.
[393:22.38]I'm like having these flashbacks right now.
[393:28.10]I would do Hail Marys every play and he would just intercept them because he knew how to control the game and catch, do like a manual catch.
[393:36.71]Steel go blocks and they hit me with Hail Marys.
[393:41.64]Ugh.
[393:50.00]This is embarrassing at this point.
[393:51.82]This is embarrassing.
[393:52.54]Oops.
[393:53.28]This is embarrassing for them.
[393:54.60]This is embarrassing.
[393:55.98]Oops.
[393:58.11]The stream.
[393:58.55]He can't stop me.
[394:21.70]Did I catch it?
[394:23.41]I got it.
[394:25.05]Alright, it's fourth down.
[394:26.09]Alright, let's go.
[394:32.37]Alright, oops.
[394:46.07]42-9 I win
[395:26.04]I love how we have devolved to just me not giving a shit.
[395:39.34]I just got home alone.
[395:44.00]Like, I'm up by so much.
[395:47.78]I've trained my team so well.
[395:50.83]There was a challenge here in the first few games of Division, but now it doesn't even matter.
[395:58.90]Good for you.
[395:59.40]You got 15 points.
[396:00.80]Get fucking destroyed.
[396:01.78]75 points?
[396:02.24]No, that's not possible anymore.
[396:39.16]I mean, maybe it is.
[396:40.12]I might get 50 or 60.
[396:41.40]Maybe not 70.
[396:41.70]It's possible for me to get 60.
[397:14.82]Let's just jump backwards.
[397:17.90]Use those timeouts.
[397:18.80]I'm gonna go for it.
[397:19.36]I'll try.
[397:19.84]Onside kick.
[397:20.28]Come on.
[397:20.56]Give me the 60.
[397:21.40]Possible.
[397:21.82]It's possible.
[397:49.16]First down and 30.
[397:50.07]Ooh, almost.
[397:52.99]Oh, dick.
[397:54.21]It's not possible anymore.
[397:55.63]I got to, whatever.
[397:59.28]Onside kick.
[397:59.78]I don't care.
[398:00.34]Just boot it into the fucking crowd.
[398:19.11]You had time.
[398:19.51]You had time.
[398:20.03]It's OK.
[398:20.21]Another interception.
[398:20.75]Turn it into a score.
[398:41.80]Here it comes.
[398:46.36]We can do it.
[398:47.52]Let me just do something real quick here.
[398:48.80]I need to get one completion and I can get into the end zone.
[398:54.00]Guaranteed pass.
[398:57.01]That's perfect.
[399:01.49]No, I didn't... Okay, I got it.
[399:02.47]Okay, okay, okay.
[399:03.15]Hold on, hold on.
[399:04.35]Oh, no!
[399:05.55]Please tell me that...
[399:15.10]I'm trying just to get a point.
[399:16.80]That's not a point?
[399:17.44]Just give me a point!
[399:47.29]He's fine.
[399:48.43]Let's get you out of here.
[399:52.39]There we go.
[399:53.03]Let's go.
[399:53.39]Pull him still.
[399:54.31]Hang on, buddy.
[399:54.93]You'll be alright.
[399:55.65]Not even going to see the end of the game.
[400:03.59]Alright, here comes 80 points.
[400:06.39]I'm fucking laughing.
[400:09.45]Lofts one.
[400:24.45]Let's just get 60 points.
[400:26.45]I told you I was gonna get like 60 points 60 In the Super Bowl, this would be the worst Super Bowl ever
[400:55.44]I didn't get dirty hit by Bruno.
[400:57.42]And that is the Super Bowl.
[400:58.94]Face of the league.
[400:59.44]Time for the boss battle.
[401:00.08]There actually might be something else after.
[401:24.69]I'm not even sure Bruno was even playing.
[401:26.51]He might have been injured.
[401:33.76]Commercial shoot.
[401:35.87]New touchdown.
[401:36.43]Hand exchange.
[401:37.51]Circle, circle, square, X. Staying alive.
[401:40.63]Let's see how this plays out.
[401:55.96]Speech, speech.
[402:03.21]Thank you.
[402:03.67]Thank you.
[402:06.37]Damn, that Russell McKinley sure healed fast, didn't he, Commissioner?
[402:11.27]I am going to destroy you.
[402:13.48]Oh, no, I'm ruined.
[402:14.72]I think you're going to be too busy to worry about me anymore.
[402:18.34]Why is that, Joe?
[402:19.52]Fuck.
[402:20.87]He turns and does a dirty tackle with one of those reporters.
[402:25.33]He taps X really fast.
[402:27.17]He gets away.
[402:56.54]Blitz the League 2.
[403:05.49]What is this footage here?
[403:07.21]We got the designers.
[403:08.75]We got the artists.
[403:09.81]And we got the programmer.
[403:11.59]Oh, this is so good.
[403:12.85]It's behind the scenes footage.
[403:14.13]Nice shirt.
[403:16.59]Nice shirt.
[403:21.97]Open your mouth.
[403:23.14]You know what's fun?
[403:25.08]They probably had making this.
[403:26.95]Wow, that's unreal.
[403:30.35]I don't know, but you're moving.
[403:36.45]I got freaked out.
[403:41.31]Where's the Santa Claus?
[403:42.17]Here, dude.
[403:43.53]Snack natural.
[403:45.37]What's up, man?
[403:46.25]What's going on, man?
[403:47.79]What's going on?
[403:49.30]Mr. Friedland, lead designer.
[403:51.08]What's happening?
[403:51.62]How's it going?
[403:52.74]Good.
[403:53.52]What's up, Steven?
[403:54.32]Where are you now?
[403:55.99]Alright, so the internet says that we can pop popcorn with cell phones.
[404:00.11]We're just going to test that out right now just to see.
[404:03.59]Which one is Ed?
[404:04.55]That's right.
[404:04.99]I don't think he's here.
[404:05.75]You know what you should do?
[404:08.91]You just go to Weevil and put it in front of him.
[404:26.16]Flaring out the milk.
[404:28.79]No, I flared out that fucking milk.
[404:32.70]I don't want them to know it's from the hood.
[404:34.94]Yeah, that's quite a difference here.
[404:38.53]Now I got H-I-O-R-S.
[404:41.13]Oh, and again.
[404:41.91]You're really good at playing the meat.
[404:44.89]Literally, six or seven guys on the ground.
[404:48.25]I run it back for full touchdown.
[404:49.61]That was game.
[404:50.33]You just squinted and crashed.
[404:52.74]14 to 20, dude.
[404:53.92]That's a score, buddy.
[404:56.10]See, they're just having a couple of beers and playing this is what I'm talking about.
[405:01.76]I'm sure it would look phenomenal.
[405:03.68]It would be.
[405:12.67]Oh, man.
[405:13.81]Can you believe it?
[405:20.53]Pizza?
[405:20.93]That's it?
[405:21.43]Yeah.
[405:21.79]Good.
[405:21.95]Look at all those mosaics.
[405:24.79]That was more mosaic than it was frame of a guy.
[405:29.01]Uh-oh.
[405:34.25]There it is.
[405:39.47]Franchise, you've really earned your name today.
[405:42.05]Just do me a favor, man.
[405:43.49]Don't let it go to your head.
[405:45.10]We have a title to defend next season.
[405:47.38]Stay cool, stay clean, and you know I'll always have your back.
[405:52.64]How does it feel being the biggest celebrity on the planet?
[405:55.42]And the league championship is just the beginning.
[405:57.78]You've built a championship caliber team.
[406:00.20]Now take it online and show the rest of the dweebs in the world that nobody does it better than you.
[406:05.11]So this is the take it to on.
[406:06.35]This is the take your team into online.
[406:10.79]It's not even turned on anymore.
[406:13.49]Let's take a look.
[406:14.13]Let's see the last little bits here.
[406:18.97]President's Trophy.
[406:20.50]Division 3.
[406:22.16]Didn't get the passing title in Division 3.
[406:25.50]Rushing.
[406:26.46]Receiving.
[406:27.68]Defense.
[406:30.72]Well, there's the MVP.
[406:33.60]The Las Vegas Super Bowls.
[406:34.86]I hate this name.
[406:38.25]There's a lot here.
[406:38.99]Alright, let's see.
[406:41.31]Defensive title, Division 1.
[406:43.47]For Mr. Super Bowl.
[406:47.59]Division 1 champions.
[406:49.07]There it is.
[406:50.80]Division 1 MVP.
[406:55.37]Pretty cool.
[406:56.75]What about trophies?
[406:59.73]Now finish the campaign.
[407:00.83]Franchise declare the MVP in all three divisions.
[407:04.54]Didn't get it.
[407:09.38]Very, very cool.
[407:10.28]So, I'm able to do this.
[407:11.98]Where's my final stat?
[407:19.01]League standings, let's see.
[407:21.37]7-1, I was... What am I total?
[407:26.02]Something in three.
[407:30.72]16-3?
[407:30.76]15-3?
[407:31.30]That's pretty good.
[407:40.28]That was a really, really fun game.
[407:43.60]And that is the end of Blitz the League 2.
[407:50.38]Let me just take a look and see if there's any bonus stuff.
[407:59.11]There are a few bonus modes.
[408:01.49]Butterfingers, it's total chaos on the field with every tackle leading into a fumble.
[408:08.37]You get the ball back after every score.
[408:11.78]Every play that goes by without a score decreases the points from a touchdown by one.
[408:17.97]Dirty hits, unleashed hits, and injuries all add points to your score.
[408:21.75]That's pretty cool.
[408:23.77]The helmets are off and the hits are twice as painful, leading to tons of injuries.
[408:29.09]There's prison ball, no kickoff, no first downs, and a shortened field.
[408:36.00]Uh... Let's take the helmets off, I'm just fucking around.
[408:46.35]Doesn't really matter.
[408:47.07]I'll be the regular Vegas team.
[408:51.47]I'm just doing it for fun anyways.
[408:52.51]So nobody has helmets on.
[409:05.40]So this is prison ball without being a prison.
[409:14.16]Do the Aztecs have perfect stats?
[409:15.68]I think they are one of the only teams that have perfect stats.
[409:20.92]And maybe not perfect, but good enough where it looks like that.
[409:24.67]I think there was one other team that was like that.
[409:27.99]Good evening, everyone.
[409:29.97]No helmets.
[409:38.70]First injury, the game turns off.
[409:41.40]Make it count.
[409:42.40]First down and 30.
[409:57.18]That deserves a taunt, if I can get it again.
[410:13.31]Well, thanks for coming to the stream.
[410:18.17]That's where I'm gonna call it.
[410:24.34]Play Mutant Football League.
[410:25.72]Maybe eventually.
[410:28.47]But that was Blitz the League 2.
[410:30.41]If you weren't here earlier, I have an unfortunate thing to tell everybody.
[410:35.80]I'm doing my taxes over the next day or two.
[410:39.92]And I... There's a lot I have to do.
[410:43.08]So I'm taking the next day or two off.
[410:45.76]I had other shit to do the last couple days.
[410:48.24]So sorry there's only like one stream in the last like four days.
[411:01.66]Stream you doing your taxes.
[411:05.85]No, it's a painful fucking process.
[411:12.83]So I'll let you guys know, I'm gonna try to do it all tomorrow.
[411:17.63]Somebody else got fucking hurt and I didn't do anything.
[411:22.75]People are just breaking legs and shit.
[411:24.85]Hey, just look, I'm not even controlling the game.
[411:37.50]Yeah, I gotta there's a lot of weird shit that I have to take care of So nothing tomorrow I'll let you guys know on here If I got them all done So you can wipe out the whole other team
[412:02.26]I have to just... My CPA is going to be very angry with me.
[412:10.08]I was supposed to do this two weeks ago and I just didn't.
[412:13.74]And I keep saying, I'll do it next week, I'll do it next week.
[412:15.88]I have to do it.
[412:16.93]I gotta just take a day or two and do it.
[412:18.29]And it's tomorrow.
[412:19.17]And the next day maybe.
[412:24.05]Turn off the game.
[412:24.83]Oh, sorry.
[412:31.65]But I will not see you tomorrow, at least.
[412:34.88]Thank you for joining me.
[412:41.24]I will do my best.
[412:47.87]At any rate, what do you say we go through the bits that came in earlier?
[412:53.80]Let me get this turned off.
[413:02.84]Uh, drop in frames, but it's okay.
[413:06.82]So, earlier we had Demonic Cucumber at $2 earlier.
[413:10.94]Or $3, actually.
[413:12.40]They say, a lot of complications doing taxes for a dead guy.
[413:19.00]And just admit it, Otto ate Cheeto.
[413:23.45]No.
[413:24.81]That didn't happen.
[413:27.79]So this is more shitty and more complicated rugby.
[413:31.40]American football is kind of like rugby.
[413:35.40]Except they wear helmets.
[413:40.60]And there's a lot less kicking the ball.
[413:44.79]That happens a lot in rugby, doesn't it?
[413:52.23]Question on taxes, do I have to do anything specific to explain randomly getting like $2,000?
[413:56.25]It's all income.
[413:58.25]I have to claim it all.
[414:00.20]On top of that, moving across the country is... I think I have to file separate returns.
[414:06.78]And... My taxes, it's not as simple as just opening up TurboTax and being like, okay, this, this, this.
[414:14.11]There's like expenses and because it's all 1099, I don't have like a W-2.
[414:19.98]So it's always like a full two day process to get it all done.
[414:32.60]So taxes for Boston and taxes for Vegas.
[414:34.80]Yeah, because I moved.
[414:37.46]I got here in like October.
[414:40.14]So I wasn't like a Massachusetts resident anymore as of October.
[414:45.67]So I gotta figure out what I need to do for that.
[414:52.67]Self-employment I hear is a pain in the ass for taxes.
[414:54.80]It is, but it's alright.
[414:57.14]As long as you stay on top of it, it's just sitting down and actually doing it.
[415:04.12]And I've determined and I've said it tomorrow's the day.
[415:12.74]there's a dog but thank you demonic cucumber for the three dollars some guy thanks for the ten dollar some guy uh alright I'm done with phantom oh of the opera for real this time can't promise I won't come back to it within a week in the meantime here's something that isn't a phantom meme so you don't have to delete your channel again I don't know if I believe this
[415:42.40]think I don't think I believe you you've told me every time that is not a Phantom of the Opera meme and every time I've clicked it's been Phantom of the Opera so I bet a trillion dollars that this is Phantom of the Opera
[416:10.07]It's full metal, uh, jacket, but it's Disney character.
[416:26.20]I mean, here, it's like, it's the whole thing as Donald Duck.
[416:29.87]And Goofy and shit.
[416:33.61]Well, I'm back.
[416:34.55]Well, there's a trillion dollars.
[416:45.83]Thank you some guy for the $10 and not a fan of the opera Disney Full metal Disney Yeah, it was a monopoly money, that's right Hey Divas, thanks for the two bucks Divas
[417:04.35]Combine, thanks for the $1.
[417:05.63]Hey Jermaine, I'm just curious if you still play Bloodborne every now and again.
[417:09.17]Oh, did you expand your enjoyment in it already?
[417:13.93]Which ending did you get?
[417:15.73]That's all.
[417:16.15]Say hello to your mother for me.
[417:17.87]I've seen every ending in Bloodborne.
[417:20.35]I've played through it at least a half dozen times.
[417:25.58]I've gotten pretty much everything I could have possibly gotten out of it.
[417:31.46]I've seen them all.
[417:35.43]And without... I don't really want to give spoilers.
[417:38.99]But there are a handful of endings, and by handful I mean three.
[417:44.49]In that game.
[417:47.32]Sekiro does come out soon.
[417:48.28]I'm going to be all over that.
[417:50.50]Better believe it.
[417:50.96]Hey, Djack, thanks for the $1.
[417:54.40]I can't believe I just saw someone say this game is boring.
[417:58.08]Jeremiah literally just exploded someone's scrotum on stream.
[418:01.52]And you're not entertained.
[418:03.90]Well, there's only so many times you can watch somebody's balls explode before you've seen it already.
[418:09.29]But, we got through, like, the shock value last stream.
[418:14.95]And I just, I wanted to win the Super Bowl and beat the game.
[418:18.42]Because I find the game to be very fun.
[418:19.94]Which it is.
[418:24.92]I've grown numb to this violence.
[418:30.29]I'm just sad that there's not another one.
[418:32.05]The current gen.
[418:32.67]It'd be great.
[418:34.31]They could probably expand on it so much more.
[418:38.99]But, thank you, Djack.
[418:39.87]Thank you, TimmyTimTam, for the $1.
[418:41.29]Why are you never fucking wearing clothes, you weirdo?
[418:45.82]I have clothes on, just not enough to turn my webcam on.
[418:48.60]I don't have to do webcam anyways.
[418:50.72]I do it, like, once in a while.
[418:53.78]Hey, Razzle, thanks for the $1.
[418:55.12]Where are you... Where are you never fucking...
[419:03.21]Huh?
[419:05.51]Is that like a... I don't understand.
[419:10.75]Thank you, Razzle.
[419:11.39]Thank you, Marvish Magali for the $1.
[419:12.85]Hey, Jerma.
[419:13.73]You planning to do a face reveal anytime soon?
[419:15.45]You promised, man.
[419:16.41]We know that's not your real face.
[419:20.11]What, you think I've just been wearing somebody's skin this whole time?
[419:25.58]It's me.
[419:27.60]I'm me.
[419:32.06]Hey Natty, thank you for the one dollar.
[419:34.06]Hey Jerma, I have two important questions.
[419:37.11]You ever play GTA San Andreas online?
[419:39.15]Uh, I have not.
[419:42.01]And number two, you named your robot console SunSega.
[419:46.71]What about your PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3?
[419:50.11]Xbox One controller and SEGA CD.
[419:56.48]Laffy, daffy, sneezy, sleepy, anger, denial, acceptance.
[420:07.31]The fucking 12 dwarves.
[420:13.55]But thank you for the $1.
[420:14.41]Thank you, Meef Pleeble, for the $12.
[420:16.45]$12 from Meef Peeble, Pleeble.
[420:23.04]Uh, HeyJerBear had a stream idea, which I understand will probably never happen.
[420:29.46]Uh, MattBurgerMan comes on the stream acting like a real nice person, but you slowly corrupt him back to Burgah Boy until he eats an entire Big Mac and then chokes to death.
[420:43.09]What?
[420:50.11]Why would that, why would I do that?
[420:57.60]You want like the return of Burgah Boy?
[420:59.16]I can't like in canon have Burgah Boy be gone.
[421:04.31]What is it?
[421:04.75]No.
[421:15.65]Burgah Boy grew up and turned into Cadet Carrot.
[421:19.71]That's at least what was supposed to happen.
[421:24.92]His character was gonna change, and he was gonna turn into Cadet Cavern.
[421:28.14]And he's gonna be really healthy.
[421:29.16]Well, he just never did it.
[421:40.55]He just stayed Burgah Boy.
[421:45.98]Non-canon?
[421:46.68]No, that is canon.
[421:47.66]That was really gonna happen.
[421:51.30]Hey, thank you Turkish Spaghetti for the $5.
[421:53.62]Hey streamer, two months ago I got Hotline Miami 1 and 2 after being inspired by you playing it and made a goal to 100% both games and it took about 76 hours.
[422:03.33]But I did it just a few hours ago.
[422:05.43]Hotline Miami 1 was easy, but Hotline Miami 2 made me beat the already hard game on hard mode in A plus every level.
[422:13.85]Thanks for listening to my brag.
[422:16.09]You're one of my favorite streamers.
[422:18.36]That's hard to do.
[422:20.56]Ah, 76 hours.
[422:24.46]Congratulations, that's... That is a gamer achievement.
[422:30.48]I'm okay with just beating the game.
[422:33.06]Because, my god, going back and doing those on hard... That will be ins... I don't think I could do it.
[422:41.84]So... Anybody that can... Hell yeah, that's awesome.
[422:51.53]Still never did the idea.
[422:52.43]I didn't do Shrek, you're right.
[422:54.05]And I promised I was going to open with Shrek.
[422:57.73]I'm full of empty promises, aren't I?
[423:00.55]Hey, creation of the cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[423:02.21]Hey, Jerma, just found out that in 4.4 billion years, the sun will explode.
[423:05.97]Meaning every planet except for Pluto will be vaporized.
[423:10.41]But we won't even be alive to see that because in 2 million years, Mercury will crash into Earth.
[423:16.01]I'm scared.
[423:20.29]Uh, I don't think we're gonna last 2 million years.
[423:26.48]I would be surprised if we made it like another fucking 30.
[423:28.76]You know what I mean?
[423:34.46]I'd be surprised if we made it like another fucking 200 years.
[423:44.91]Don't you watch Star Trek?
[423:45.99]We'll be fine.
[423:51.62]That's a nihilist.
[423:53.58]No, I'm just saying, like, two million years.
[423:57.76]We don't even know what happened to the fucking Mayans.
[424:00.94]They were around for a long time.
[424:03.61]The dinosaurs?
[424:05.13]Gone.
[424:06.23]They were around for, what, like, fucking million years?
[424:10.01]Two million years is a long time.
[424:21.43]What killed the dinosaurs?
[424:22.57]I don't know.
[424:24.36]Probably some kind of fucking fluid.
[424:26.76]That they were inhaling.
[424:30.22]That would be my guess.
[424:47.42]It's water.
[424:49.12]Yeah, the ice age.
[424:49.86]The whole planet got real cold.
[424:54.54]Okay, but if that was possible before... Oh, you know, uh, well, the dinosaurs were around, and then the whole Earth turned into an ice cube for a million years.
[425:04.51]You don't think that could happen again?
[425:05.61]You don't think we could go into, like, a Dark Souls fuckin' Light the Flame scenario?
[425:14.98]That's possible.
[425:23.51]Who knows?
[425:24.03]In 500 years, we've got all kinds of potential global warming crises.
[425:29.51]The dinosaurs might come back.
[425:31.23]They're probably still buried.
[425:32.23]You know, how far can we dig into the Earth?
[425:35.59]Global warming is going to make the dinosaurs that were buried in ice 500 meters below the Earth's surface.
[425:43.64]It's going to melt those ice cubes.
[425:45.00]You ever see Jurassic Park with the mosquitoes in the ice cube?
[425:48.14]Imagine 50 fucking trillion super mosquitoes all melting because of global goddamn warming.
[425:53.10]And they're all going to come up and suck all your blood.
[426:01.72]You know how cold it is in the center of the Earth?
[426:05.28]It's like 12 Celsius.
[426:09.86]No, like negative 5 Celsius.
[426:12.96]They tell you it's magma.
[426:14.26]It's bullshit.
[426:16.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[426:17.54]It's not hot in there.
[426:19.56]The whole Earth is just a giant ice cube.
[426:22.49]That's gonna melt.
[426:44.95]That's why wine are in cellars.
[426:47.45]Yeah, somebody gets it.
[426:54.93]That's why when it's 90 degrees outside and you go down the lower level in your house, go in your basement, it's much cooler down there.
[427:01.77]You're gonna get closer to the Earth's center ice cube.
[427:05.73]Holy shit.
[427:06.31]Okay, before anyone thinks this is real, I better move on.
[427:17.89]But thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[427:20.31]They say guten morgen.
[427:22.25]Good morning.
[427:23.71]Dingustown.
[427:24.25]Thanks for the $15, Dingustown.
[427:25.69]Get yourself some V-Bucks.
[427:27.03]My treat.
[427:31.21]I'm not going to buy V-Bucks.
[427:34.42]But I will buy a suit.
[427:41.64]$15 suit.
[427:42.58]They make them.
[427:46.00]Scammed.
[427:47.80]I wouldn't wanna- but what am I gonna do with that?
[427:51.47]$15 in V-Bucks?
[427:53.31]What can that- can that get me like a dance?
[427:55.63]Can I get like ORANGE SHIRTKIT?!
[427:57.91]Fucking whip it around!
[427:59.13]Can I get that with $15?
[427:59.97]No.
[428:11.08]Is that more expensive?
[428:14.10]But thank you so much Dingus Town for the $15.
[428:19.41]The $15 in V-Bucks.
[428:22.27]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $2.
[428:24.47]I've been subscribed to you for 34 months.
[428:26.73]Can you believe that?
[428:28.07]It's kind of insane to see that number.
[428:30.49]Is that enough for you to play God Hand?
[428:32.65]No?
[428:32.93]Alright, I'm ending that joke right now.
[428:34.59]Until I hear you say, I'm going to play God Hand in a few weeks.
[428:38.12]Oh, okay.
[428:38.52]Thanks, Jerma.
[428:42.06]I still have the PlayStation 2, but God Hand was digital...
[428:47.05]How did I even get God Hand if it was digital?
[428:49.13]If it's PlayStation 2, how did I play it?
[428:52.39]There's no digital store for PS2.
[428:53.99]How did I play that game?
[428:56.80]Was that PS3, like, PSN store?
[428:58.90]I don't even remember how I even got it.
[429:11.85]It's on the PS... Okay, it's on the PS3 store.
[429:13.71]PS Now.
[429:16.08]Well, I can't tell you I'm never going to play it ever again, but I am going to tell you, don't expect it.
[429:23.78]Watch me turn it on next stream.
[429:28.21]But thank you, SnoozingCopter.
[429:30.97]Thank you so much.
[429:34.03]Thank you, Niall Arian for the $1.
[429:35.53]So this is basically the XFL.
[429:39.02]It is kind of the XFL, except people get very hurt in this game.
[429:45.72]You'd hope that they wouldn't in real life, right?
[429:50.18]But thank you.
[429:50.70]Thank you, Lazy Luke, for the $1.
[429:51.60]Will you change your bits threshold in your settings to 300 so that we can't donate bits that won't be red?
[429:58.88]New people could be disappointed if their bits aren't red.
[430:02.56]No, because then that means that nobody can ever give anything below $3.
[430:08.81]And at the end of the day, bits are another form of support, right?
[430:15.18]Whether you subscribe to the channel or if you give bits a 15 cents, 20 cents.
[430:19.28]I see people give it all the time.
[430:20.78]People give it all the time.
[430:22.82]So I wouldn't want to make it impossible for someone to give me less than $3.
[430:31.00]Because I don't want the threshold, because at that point, instead of just reading, you're not allowed to give me money unless it's three bucks.
[430:41.41]Which the purpose of, you know, all these, you know, subs and bits in the first place are for someone to want to support the channel.
[431:02.83]$50 minimum incoming, no.
[431:13.57]Yeah, that was a lot of back and forth with trying to figure out how that was going to happen.
[431:17.71]But there had to be something.
[431:19.03]Something had to be done.
[431:22.59]Because, as we all know, some of these end of the stream, sometimes there's hundreds of messages, hundreds of donations that
[431:32.59]The stream can go on.
[431:33.95]After the stream is technically over and we sit here for like another hour or two hours or whatever, it's gonna get to a point where it's just not feasible to sit here for like four, five hours plus.
[431:46.05]And I'd like to get in front of it rather than try to catch up to it potentially later.
[431:59.76]Just talk like an auctioneer.
[432:03.07]Well, that's another thing I've seen people talk about.
[432:05.53]Well, why don't you just hurry up then and read them?
[432:08.71]I mean, that's not the point of why I want to do this.
[432:11.94]It would be really easy for me to go like this.
[432:13.86]Hey, Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[432:15.44]Change your bitch to $300.
[432:16.16]Nah, thanks, man.
[432:16.96]Hey, Niall Oren, thanks for the $1.
[432:19.02]Dig up Robbie so he can run into it.
[432:20.60]Thanks a lot, man.
[432:21.13]Thanks a lot, Niall, for the $1.
[432:22.63]Dig up Mim so he can run the field.
[432:24.01]Nah, thanks, man.
[432:24.63]I don't want to do that.
[432:28.02]I mean, at that point, I'm just... At that point, I'm just reading them because they're here.
[432:34.84]Instead of giving attention to as many of them as I can.
[432:37.75]And talk about things and hang out and... It's more fun that way for me.
[432:42.19]I don't just want to have it be a thing that I'm just phoning in and reading just because they're here.
[432:53.21]So I like to give each message at least some attention.
[432:56.23]And yeah, some of the jokey ones that people give and they'll say something ridiculous and I'll just be like, alright, and I'll kind of just keep going.
[433:02.59]But for the most part, I like to give each one like a full, my full attention.
[433:14.76]Show feet.
[433:17.02]Really?
[433:17.26]Really?
[433:22.94]That's the response?
[433:24.97]From the one guy there?
[433:28.67]Anyways.
[433:30.67]That's gonna change probably in like a week.
[433:34.49]Some point in the middle of February.
[433:35.87]I wanted to give enough people time to know that it was gonna happen.
[433:39.84]And like last time, it's still gonna be a process for people to understand that that's happening.
[433:44.82]But I wanted to give at least a couple weeks, two or three weeks for people to figure it out, right?
[433:50.26]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[433:52.55]And hey, thanks Niall Orion for the $2 here.
[433:55.85]They did say dig up Robby so he can run it in one last time and dig up Mims so he can run the field one last time.
[434:02.93]Mims was on the field.
[434:09.90]Mims was on the field.
[434:11.78]We got rid of Robby because Robby got his, like, spine broken.
[434:16.66]And we replaced him with another guy who got injured every other game, but was the best player in the league.
[434:22.05]So, you know, that's just the way it is.
[434:28.03]Hidden details?
[434:28.51]I don't know.
[434:42.53]Hey, Captain of the Nevermind, thanks for the $10.
[434:46.81]Thank you so much for $10.
[434:49.01]Jerma, can you add Leon's piss moans as a permanent sound effect for BRBs, please?
[434:56.38]No.
[434:59.70]Those were not Leon piss moans.
[435:01.28]That was Leon moaning and groaning because he had an injury.
[435:07.15]That was so funny, though.
[435:13.07]Piss moans.
[435:17.41]Thank you, Captain of the Nevermind, though, for $10.
[435:22.35]I'm probably going to have some new stuff made over the coming few months here.
[435:28.81]Maybe some new slides, some new stream over animations, some new images.
[435:33.65]I'll probably get some stuff done.
[435:37.21]Have some more, like, music and...
[435:41.02]I think it's time.
[435:42.00]We've had these great animations for a long time.
[435:44.36]Maybe it's time to change them up.
[435:48.72]Or at least add some.
[435:52.04]But thank you so much, Captain.
[435:53.50]Of the Nevermind for the $10.
[435:56.06]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $1.
[435:57.92]Football, yeah.
[436:01.16]That's it?
[436:02.68]Football, yeah.
[436:05.84]I can't believe I beat this whole thing on stream.
[436:11.08]I loved it, though.
[436:13.02]Hope it was entertaining enough, because I was so into it, I had to play it.
[436:19.11]You just made a shirt of the planet and now you're changing the- No, no, no, I'm not talking about that, I'm just talking about to make new ones.
[436:27.99]The planets can stay, it's not like I'm gonna change the whole image.
[436:31.89]Just have new animations and new stuff, maybe based around solo planets.
[436:37.97]Have like a Jupiter BRB screen that can play.
[436:41.20]Have a moon BRB screen that does something.
[436:45.36]More music.
[436:45.90]I'm not talking about changing... You know, the... In super quotes, the aesthetic of the stream.
[436:54.85]Just adding to it.
[437:01.47]But... Thank you, creation.
[437:03.75]TheCyborg for the $1.
[437:04.85]Hey, Jerma just got news that on the 2nd of April, Google Plus is shutting down.
[437:10.92]All the posts you've ever had on Google Plus will be gone.
[437:15.47]Stop by Google Plus and see the end.
[437:22.43]The only reason why I had Google Plus in the first place is because it was forced on me by YouTube.
[437:27.43]I had to connect my account to Google Plus.
[437:31.05]And it just sat there rotting.
[437:32.29]I don't think I ever used it.
[437:39.23]I remember that was so desperate.
[437:42.78]What the hell were they thinking?
[437:45.44]Attaching every YouTube account had to parasite into their body, into their channel, Google+.
[437:54.72]It was a requirement.
[437:58.05]What were they thinking?
[438:02.49]I don't know.
[438:03.61]And now the thing is shutting down.
[438:06.53]That's kind of unbelievable.
[438:13.70]But if you do use it, sorry that it's going down.
[438:16.38]I think there are a lot of other places that are probably better at this point.
[438:23.67]Something I think you guys are becoming very well aware of is anytime that there's a game that requires attention or focus from me, all other functions of my brain don't exist.
[438:43.20]I gotta dedicate 100% of my thrusters to that game.
[438:52.58]If I can't dedicate 100% thrusters, that ship is not leaving the harbor.
[439:00.60]And I'll just walk into a wall somewhere.
[439:06.41]We know.
[439:06.97]Yeah, I know.
[439:07.85]That's why when we play games like this and I do a game like this, I have like four words that I'll say.
[439:15.79]Ooh!
[439:17.71]Fuck.
[439:18.67]Oops.
[439:20.41]Embarrassing.
[439:23.27]That's it.
[439:25.25]Now I may have been playing pretty well and been doing well and gone 16 and 3.
[439:36.99]It's just me playing ad-libs.
[439:39.31]But I do the same ad- I do the same ad-lib.
[439:45.71]That wouldn't be- I wouldn't be very good at that.
[439:49.98]But, I still had a blast.
[439:55.34]Thank you, Niall Orian, for the $1.
[439:56.72]Thank you, Anonymous, for the $1.
[439:57.74]Hey, Jerma, it's the animal rescue guy with the last of his bits.
[440:01.77]I was watching the last VOD and I want to say it warms my heart to see people saying raid ducks.
[440:06.43]Happy people enjoy the animals.
[440:08.49]I love you chat and Jerma.
[440:09.85]Oh, and some of our rescue tortoises just had babies.
[440:13.65]So it looks like I'll always have some baby animal to string.
[440:20.29]Baby tortoise, what does a baby tortoise look like?
[440:25.87]I shit you not, the only time I've ever seen a baby tortoise or a baby turtle
[440:30.57]is a cartoon version of the Ninja Turtles when they go in the ooze.
[440:37.38]I don't know what they look like.
[440:44.68]Probably cute.
[440:46.18]Turtles are cool.
[440:49.39]But keep doing your thing, Anonymous.
[440:51.07]Thank you so much for the $1, and keep on keeping on.
[440:56.50]Hey, Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[440:58.26]You ever have that, uh, acid reflex?
[441:00.06]Haha, what are you gonna do?
[441:02.35]What are you gonna do?
[441:06.09]Hey, uh, Sugar, thanks for the $1.
[441:07.89]What's Gucci, Jerma?
[441:08.97]I want to wish you a happy 56th birthday today.
[441:11.55]Time flies when you're having fun, huh?
[441:13.69]In all seriousness, when is the Mind Eraser Frog emote gonna arrive?
[441:17.19]I've been waiting centuries.
[441:19.11]Also, you've mispronounced my name in all of my bit messages as Sugar Shin.
[441:24.54]I do not have sugary shins.
[441:25.88]Thank you very much.
[441:26.66]For future reference, the shinks in sugar shinks is pronounced like links.
[441:31.86]Anyways, love you, Jermbo.
[441:32.90]Keep up the best.
[441:34.54]And that's why sometimes I just say the first part of people's names, because I just mispronounce everything.
[441:45.09]Sugar shins.
[441:47.61]I don't know.
[441:49.66]100% of my fucking rosters.
[441:51.55]Hey Peter, thanks for the $3.85.
[441:53.55]They say, hey guys.
[441:55.99]Thank you, Peter.
[441:57.73]Thanks for the $3.85.
[441:58.21]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[442:02.57]$2.
[442:03.93]Back to back here.
[442:04.57]Any of you guys notice that Jerma has trouble playing and commenting since the day of Jerma's death?
[442:11.57]Now he talks between the game.
[442:14.08]Just like Etalyx does.
[442:15.34]When was the last time they streamed at the same time?
[442:17.64]Two days ago.
[442:21.48]checkmate uh hey I know we like to joke around on the stream but I want you to know that your content seriously means a lot to us all the fact that we can have this back and forth is a testament to how approachable and compassionate you are I don't think anyone in this chat room would ever seriously wish to upset you from all of us turn my heart I don't believe that either and that goes both ways I don't want to piss people off
[442:49.24]I want you to have fun.
[442:50.46]And I want us to all enjoy the streams and have a great time and... I think it would be very counterproductive if I was, like, actively trying to make somebody angry.
[443:02.21]I hope it's not the same way on your end.
[443:05.83]Thank you so much, though.
[443:09.23]Star Saber, thanks for the $1.
[443:10.53]Roses of red, violets of blue.
[443:12.93]Sorry I called your Arizona... Sorry I called your team Arizona Ice Tea.
[443:16.49]Now please go pee.
[443:20.23]That's not how that is.
[443:21.51]Roses are red, violets are blue, so I called your team Arizona Ice Tea.
[443:28.53]Now... Here's my shoe.
[443:31.14]And that's when, like, you do, like, a big, like, kick.
[443:35.36]Thank you, Star Saber.
[443:36.10]Thank you, Broluck, for the five dollars.
[443:38.58]American football looks very so slow and boring.
[443:43.60]Not this one though.
[443:45.68]Alright.
[443:46.94]I agree.
[443:47.38]I don't play sports games on this stream.
[443:49.97]I don't play sports games.
[443:51.39]I don't do like baseball or NBA or hockey or games.
[443:56.57]I mean, I know that sports games are kind of a little boring.
[443:59.15]They can be, but I was breaking spines.
[444:07.48]Do you see how many times the frog limbs would show up?
[444:15.31]At least this football game lets you kill people.
[444:20.87]Well, nobody actually gets that injured, except for Robbie.
[444:27.31]You played Tony Hawk last week.
[444:28.61]That doesn't count.
[444:30.49]That's an adventure game.
[444:32.41]That is a four-wheel adventure game.
[444:35.18]That's not a sports game.
[444:41.40]but thank you bro luck hopefully you had a good time hopefully you thought it was at least interesting enough hey creation cyborg thanks for the two dollars uh Jerma I have to sleep hopefully I can wake up at one uh if so if not I will cry good luck to you remember yell fams for me fam what am I doing
[445:05.45]I can't scream anything.
[445:07.07]My voice is, like, dropping.
[445:09.09]Like, my voice is shot today for some reason.
[445:11.27]I don't know why.
[445:11.95]Why did that happen?
[445:13.15]Happened, like, halfway through for some reason.
[445:19.32]Sports ResidentSleeper.
[445:21.82]Just wait until I do an IRL stream of me in a batting cage hitting a fucking home run every single time.
[445:27.20]I'm not even going to tell you when it's going to happen.
[445:30.56]It's going to be... Oh, why?
[445:31.62]His title says IRL...
[445:35.35]In the cage.
[445:37.25]And it's just going to be me in the batting cage just smoking the ball.
[445:39.43]It's going to be like a 13 minute stream.
[445:50.06]There's also something else that I want to do.
[445:53.34]I can't talk about it.
[445:54.20]I don't want to.
[445:56.54]It's not going to be that hard but it requires a lot of work.
[446:02.33]It's so worth it though.
[446:03.99]And once it heats up a little bit
[446:06.83]Oh, I hope I can get it done.
[446:07.79]It's going to be great.
[446:11.01]Do the work.
[446:11.65]Oh, I'm... Don't you worry.
[446:13.86]Just got to get it a little nicer outside.
[446:15.08]It's a little too cold.
[446:18.06]But thank you, Creation Cyborg.
[446:19.50]Thank you, TheLongEgg for the $1.
[446:21.10]You should have done the puppy with Otto and Midas.
[446:24.74]Should have done the puppy with Otto and Midas.
[446:26.96]Puppy Bowl?
[446:29.98]Puppy Bowl, maybe.
[446:33.15]But thank you, the long egg, for the other dollar here.
[446:35.45]Take the word trophies.
[446:38.23]Uh... Take the word trophies, remove the letters P, I, and E. What does that spell backwards?
[446:46.78]Travs.
[446:47.94]Travs.
[446:50.88]Short.
[446:53.24]You could do that with any word.
[446:54.92]You could do that with any word that's long enough.
[446:57.58]You could just take out a few letters and change it.
[447:06.89]Thanks for the dollar, the long egg.
[447:10.09]Uh, Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the one dollar.
[447:12.07]Jerma, I just got here and the stream is ending.
[447:15.64]And they say, ugh.
[447:17.86]Also, I just got a job a week ago.
[447:19.76]So you're ready to hear me cheer a lot more.
[447:24.32]Congratulations on the job.
[447:25.34]Thank you so much for the one dollar.
[447:29.26]Hopefully you make some money.
[447:31.16]Good, good, good.
[447:32.60]Thank you for the one dollar, Spooky Spitfire.
[447:35.69]Mom the Peach, thanks for the one dollar.
[447:37.09]I did not cross the field of action today, Jerma.
[447:41.93]Well... What you should have done is... You should have crossed the attack of opportunity, because that's what that's called.
[447:48.43]I remember.
[447:50.41]I remember from two streams ago.
[447:52.53]See?
[447:53.71]I'm like an elephant-sized goldfish.
[447:56.37]I forget everything, but I have a lot of knowledge up here.
[448:02.83]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the one dollar.
[448:05.91]Are clown cars tax deductible?
[448:12.79]I think that depends.
[448:14.61]Are you a clown?
[448:17.73]Did you use that clown car for your work or your job?
[448:22.54]Probably.
[448:24.42]You're a clown.
[448:26.02]Am I a clown?
[448:27.66]I don't know.
[448:29.48]That's for you to understand and you to decide.
[448:37.32]Thank you, IamMonk, for the $1.
[448:38.74]I might not be able to subscribe or donate in the coming months.
[448:40.84]Don't worry about that.
[448:42.20]I know you're adamant that you don't need or require it, but I know you appreciate... I know I appreciate you and love your content enough to subscribe and grind bits to give back what I can.
[448:53.52]Love you, Jerma.
[448:54.52]Keep doing what you do best.
[448:58.72]I am forever grateful to anybody that ever wants to give me any support, any money, any viewership.
[449:07.68]it's incredibly fucking kind but don't feel like there's an obligation because there isn't you do not have an obligation to me you know what I mean if you find it necessary to want to give money to this channel thank you
[449:39.18]But it's not an obligation.
[449:45.18]The only obligation in this chat is to repeat bad memes.
[449:51.51]Well, I didn't say that.
[449:52.41]They did.
[449:54.73]But thank you so much, IamMonk.
[449:58.73]Appreciate you hanging out.
[449:59.75]Thank you.
[450:01.53]Convo Breaker, thanks for the $1.
[450:02.89]Speaking of bit reading minimums, I wanted to put this in before the minimum was raised.
[450:06.50]Could you make the minimum $2.50 instead of $3?
[450:09.46]Buying in multiples of 5 is easier than buying in multiples of 3, and it would keep from awkward buying two different sets of bits.
[450:16.27]Also, please play Pyre at some point.
[450:17.73]It's a choose-your-own-adventure game with Air Bud.
[450:24.64]Let's be fair, there are some pretty bad memes in here.
[450:26.98]I don't know about that.
[450:27.74]There's some decent ones.
[450:30.28]But, um... I'll be honest with you.
[450:34.21]The reason why I picked three is because... That's like what... That's what a lot of people have.
[450:42.77]Aren't a lot of... Most streams have like three, 350 for a minimum.
[450:48.55]That's just kind of the way... I just was like, I guess that's what people do, right?
[450:54.13]Is there a reason why that is?
[450:55.51]People do 420.
[451:03.73]250.
[451:03.81]The reason is three is between one and five.
[451:22.85]Let me look into this, because that's not... I'm open to suggestions for sure.
[451:38.40]Set the minimum body, I come back.
[451:39.76]You know, I'm going to make it 10.
[451:51.43]I was thinking 25 because you guys said yeah two and five two fit like 25 to 2.5 yeah I'm gonna let let me have an internal conversation with myself and ask if let me let me ask around for a little bit I I see that as a perfectly perfectly reasonable compromise so we'll we'll talk about this again in another couple days
[452:24.93]Make tier 1 sub $100.
[452:33.75]But thank you.
[452:35.65]Thank you for the little bit of knowledge here.
[452:41.99]Thank you, Mage, for the $1.
[452:45.29]This is a bit of a throwback fact.
[452:46.61]The voice actor for the John Madden was Frank Caliendo from MADtv.
[452:53.51]He actually does a pretty hysterical, phonetically accurate, completely accurate John Madden.
[453:00.97]It's actually really good.
[453:09.98]Thank you, Venus Gothic, for the $1.50.
[453:12.40]Hey, Jerm, hope you're enjoying Vegas.
[453:14.52]I'm a Vegas local born and raised, and I've been watching you since early TF2.
[453:18.02]Thank you for so many years of laughs, even during hard times.
[453:23.10]I'm happy to have transplanted myself into Las Vegas.
[453:30.06]I think it's a great city.
[453:31.92]I've been having a blast.
[453:33.97]I've been really, really enjoying the town.
[453:36.89]I think it was a great change.
[453:42.43]Thank you so much for the $1.50, Venus.
[453:50.32]Have a great night.
[453:54.21]Hey, Tile!
[453:55.87]Thank you, TileGoManiac, for the $1.
[453:59.01]Hey, Jer.
[454:00.34]Hey, Tile.
[454:03.40]Thanks for the $1.
[454:05.02]Something or other, thanks for the $1.
[454:06.24]Here's my lunch money.
[454:07.04]Go buy a funny hat.
[454:11.64]I don't really have very many funny hats.
[454:13.30]I think I have one hat.
[454:16.86]That's it.
[454:21.12]I have a Boston Celtics hat that I've had for like a decade.
[454:26.66]Uh, three more here.
[454:27.46]Thank you, SpookySpitfire, for the $1.
[454:29.20]I made $200 in a week, dude, so yeah.
[454:32.57]Better be ready for all those 100-bit donations.
[454:35.63]Also, I can't wait.
[454:36.47]Yes, Jerma, you are a clown.
[454:38.97]That means I can write off my clown expenses.
[454:44.97]Thank you, SpookySpitfire.
[454:45.97]Please take care of yourself first.
[454:50.56]Have me somewhere down that ladder.
[454:54.40]If you find it necessary.
[454:57.09]I'm talking about, like, steak dinner for you.
[454:59.17]Got your bills.
[455:00.55]Take care of, like, your cat.
[455:03.59]Take care of fish.
[455:07.47]And then if you still feel like it, and you really want to, then I'm here.
[455:12.85]For that, you know, bit donation.
[455:15.45]Please take care of yourself first.
[455:16.45]Thank you so much.
[455:17.23]Congratulations on the job again.
[455:19.85]Sir Rock, thanks for the $1.
[455:21.53]Hail Jerma, you asked chat to recommend Flash games a few streams ago.
[455:24.63]You're going to follow up on playing them?
[455:26.61]Yes, absolutely.
[455:29.33]I like just hanging out and chilling and playing dumb little games.
[455:36.93]It's very, very endearing to me.
[455:38.66]I think it's great.
[455:42.28]Daffy Jones, thanks for the $10 right now, Daffy Jones.
[455:45.92]Mr. Streamer, thank you for bringing all of us the laughs and happiness, but I have to ask, why do you always stream naked or shirtless?
[455:52.60]Are you some kind of nudist hippie?
[455:55.04]No.
[455:56.57]No, I'm not.
[455:57.93]I don't have any system of beliefs as to why I'm doing this.
[456:01.88]It's a biological reason.
[456:06.00]It's because when I sit down and I'm just hanging out, I just sweat.
[456:11.73]I just perspirate and there's nothing I can do about it.
[456:15.27]It's not unhealthy.
[456:16.67]It's not a bad thing.
[456:17.49]I've actually talked to doctors about it.
[456:18.87]It's like, yeah, you're a little sweaty.
[456:21.05]Only in certain places.
[456:23.35]And... I just... If I sit here with a shirt on, if I take a shower and then come and sit down here, and I'm just sitting here, I will just sweat through that shirt.
[456:32.46]So I said, you know what?
[456:33.20]Fucking whatever.
[456:35.04]Why would I do that?
[456:42.36]I've told this story a bunch of times, but I can...
[456:46.60]Put on a pair of sneakers.
[456:48.99]Get on some, like, tech gear.
[456:54.01]I got in jeans.
[456:54.99]I got in a pair of jeans and a sweater.
[456:58.37]Run five miles and one drop of sweat will not come out of my body.
[457:04.59]It's sitting here in a seat.
[457:08.09]Sweat just comes out of my arms.
[457:09.41]I don't know why.
[457:11.01]I wish I knew.
[457:14.43]How are you going to survive Vegas?
[457:15.75]Vegas is dry.
[457:17.51]I've been here before in the summer.
[457:21.61]It was 115, 116 degrees Fahrenheit.
[457:25.43]Last year here.
[457:26.69]When I came to check out places.
[457:29.34]I don't think I had a drop of sweat left my body outside.
[457:32.40]Only sitting at a desk.
[457:38.30]Don't know why.
[457:40.54]But thank you for the $10, Daffy Jones.
[457:42.30]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[457:43.51]No message.
[457:44.27]Thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[457:45.89]And then finally here we got TileGomaniac for the $1.
[457:49.73]That last donation was a typo.
[457:51.25]Big wow.
[457:51.91]I was going to ask if the Night Sky shirt will ever be shipping in women's.
[457:57.07]Uh, much love.
[457:59.51]Um, I... I don't know.
[458:02.56]Because... There's... I put the women's cut for the Glue Man shirt because it was available for so long.
[458:10.59]And the others, they're all unisex shirts.
[458:15.43]But I kind of, I don't know, I kind of didn't want to overwhelm everybody.
[458:22.19]With like four pieces of merchandise, so I was like, oh, the Gloom Man shirt was available before, but it wasn't available in a women's cut, so I'll put a women's cut for the Gloom Man shirt, and then this shirt is just a unisex shirt.
[458:33.25]Kind of like I did last time, and then I'm sure I probably will.
[458:44.13]But that's not a hard thing to do.
[458:50.79]Make a hat?
[458:51.17]I actually can make hats.
[458:54.73]I have a lot of options.
[458:57.35]But I don't want to overwhelm people with new merchandise.
[458:59.37]It's like, oh, I got two new... The shirts are back.
[459:04.18]Like one week later.
[459:05.30]And there's phone cases.
[459:06.54]And socks and stickers and hats.
[459:09.78]I'd like to wait a little bit for this particular launch of this campaign to die down a little.
[459:16.98]Then we can maybe talk about some new stuff.
[459:22.54]But yeah, that's it for the bits.
[459:23.86]Thank you everybody for hanging out.
[459:25.84]I'm going to be doing taxes tomorrow and I will let you know what the status of the stream two days from now is.
[459:32.22]And I'm going to apologize again for potentially one stream in the last four days.
[459:39.81]Well, if you count the last, you know, yesterday and the day before.
[459:43.65]I'll see what I can do.
[459:46.16]But, at least it'll all be done.
[459:48.12]And I can get the weight off my shoulders of doing taxes.
[459:53.26]It's really, it's a pain in the ass.
[459:55.70]So, I'll see you guys soon.
[459:56.92]Thank you so much, everybody.
[459:59.71]Take care.
[460:02.03]Let's get the credits rolling.
[460:05.25]All the new subs.
[460:07.79]What the fuck?
[460:12.22]What?
[460:13.50]How many subs were there?
[460:14.74]This is not real.
[460:21.07]No, no, this is because of, uh... This is because of the, uh... This... It's because the sub notification thing changed, right?
[460:35.57]Jesus.
[460:41.35]Okay, I was gonna say, were there like this many subs today?
[460:45.43]That's wild.
[460:51.50]It's going so bad, it's lagging the plugin.
[460:59.06]Read them all.
[461:01.80]Uh... I can't... Remember when I used to read out the names?
[461:10.01]I do.
[461:12.96]Oh, I remember.
[461:13.64]This is, uh, seven hours, just about eight hours.
[461:22.11]Oh, Pizza Bot!
[461:25.73]Hey, welcome, Pizza Bot!
[461:31.15]Old Jerma.
[461:32.81]Remember when Old Jerma used to read them all?
[461:36.12]Fuck that guy, fuck that guy, fuck that guy, fuck that guy!
[461:44.03]No, no, no, no, no, I mean like that you too- No, no, no, I'm talking about like that, like you guys saying that about me.
[462:00.40]I'm talking about you guys, like that guy saying that about me.
[462:08.89]It's alright.
[462:14.92]Holy shit, this is so many people.
[462:19.74]Fuck you, motherfucker.
[462:20.78]No, I didn't mean it like that.
[462:22.06]I was talking existentially out as one of you.
[462:28.03]You know, like, oh, fuck, that guy's fucked.
[462:29.81]You know, that's what I'm doing.
[462:31.95]Ow, my elbow.
[462:32.81]Look what you made me do.
[462:43.00]Were there this many subs?
[462:44.22]Uh, there were, I don't think there were this many, no, there were not this many subscribers.
[462:49.14]This is, I need to hear how this sounds.
[462:53.18]Old Jerma.
[462:54.87]Remember when Old Jerma used to read them all?
[462:56.97]Fuck that guy, fuck that guy, fuck that guy, fuck that guy!
[463:05.17]Oh well.
[463:07.71]Oh well.
[463:09.27]I'm sorry, that, whatever.
[463:13.19]Thanks, everybody.
[463:15.79]Thank you, everybody, for hanging out.
[463:17.69]I'll see you in 24 to 48 hours.
[463:21.79]And I'll be done with my taxes.
[463:27.00]And I will be very happy about it.
[463:33.48]Much love to all of you.
[463:35.75]See you very soon.
[463:37.89]Take care.
[463:39.11]Goodnight.
[463:50.83]you
