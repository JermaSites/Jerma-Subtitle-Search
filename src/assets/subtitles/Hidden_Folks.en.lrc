[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.55]I didn't do the... I didn't clear my throat before turning on the microphone.
[00:18.61]So, it's my fault.
[00:19.63]Hi, guys.
[00:23.98]Why is everybody striking?
[00:25.22]I said, hey, we're on strike.
[00:26.40]We're on strike.
[00:31.05]We're on strike.
[00:31.65]We're on strike.
[00:32.21]We're on strike.
[00:32.85]Why?
[00:33.11]For what?
[00:33.29]What happened?
[00:38.21]What did I do?
[00:40.33]We already forgot why.
[00:41.75]Look, I already know... I already know about the... The blank space thing.
[00:51.86]I was on my phone...
[00:54.27]Checking in 20 minutes ago or so.
[00:56.71]And I just see a bunch of blank spaces, blank spaces, blank, blank, blank.
[00:59.33]And I'm like, what's going on?
[00:59.91]I thought it was a bug on my iPhone.
[01:02.56]But it's not.
[01:02.98]I've already seen it.
[01:04.02]I thought it was funny.
[01:05.56]I laughed at it for a minute.
[01:08.36]So, alright.
[01:09.78]You got me.
[01:10.72]Congratulations.
[01:12.94]I thought there was no stream today.
[01:14.53]What?
[01:16.35]I thought there was a stream today.
[01:17.37]What do you mean?
[01:25.05]Last night we streamed late and I said we're gonna go tomorrow too.
[01:31.94]We tricked him.
[01:34.02]Yes.
[01:34.50]Are you gonna destroy any more marriages today?
[01:41.87]I hope not.
[01:43.63]No, we're going to dial it back a little bit.
[01:46.05]We're going to play.
[01:46.79]Actually, I say that.
[01:47.76]I'm going to stop saying that.
[01:49.76]Because every time I say that, every single time that this live stream, you've heard Jerma985 say, we're going to dial it back tonight.
[01:58.28]We're going to chill and play a game and hang out and relax for a few hours.
[02:02.59]It ends up being like a 15-hour stream, and I lose like 300 hair follicles.
[02:09.03]So, you know what?
[02:10.11]This stream is going to be fucking crazy.
[02:12.29]It's going to be nuts.
[02:13.29]I'm going to go nuts on this stream.
[02:14.87]Okay?
[02:15.65]That's how you know it's not going to happen.
[02:19.34]Is my nose blocked up?
[02:20.46]No.
[02:22.30]No.
[02:23.04]My voice sounds nasally.
[02:24.30]I don't know.
[02:25.14]Am I?
[02:25.92]Maybe I got a little... Maybe a little... Maybe just a little bit?
[02:33.10]Yeah, maybe a little.
[02:34.14]It's kind of a dusty analogy out here today.
[02:39.66]Oh, my voice gets deep.
[02:40.52]Look.
[02:43.01]My voice has three or four different places where it sits.
[02:48.39]This is what I sound like when I don't speak.
[02:52.38]With a slightly nasally blocked up nose for like ten hours.
[02:58.15]In six hours, if you keep watching the stream, two, three, four hours from now, my voice is going to sound different.
[03:03.25]It's going to sound a little higher like this, because I've been speaking for a long time.
[03:06.46]I'm very boisterous right now, because there's been no words coming out of my mouth.
[03:12.52]It's basic science.
[03:17.61]I literally cannot tell a difference, and neither can I. Thanks for coming to class.
[03:29.30]We're going to play Hidden Folks today.
[03:33.32]Which is a hidden person object game.
[03:37.30]I've been told it's really, really fun.
[03:39.70]I've been told it's... I would... I was told you're going to love this game.
[03:43.54]I'm like, okay.
[03:45.54]Am I though?
[03:46.00]Like, we'll see.
[03:52.36]Wrong.
[03:53.92]Well, there's one thing that I do know for certain.
[03:56.14]We'll switch over to it now.
[03:57.32]It's...
[04:00.11]What you're about to hear is... Well, not that.
[04:02.93]I mean, that's pretty cool as a rumor.
[04:04.75]You're about to hear every single Jerma985 stream from start to finish.
[04:10.29]Hey.
[04:19.92]Ah.
[04:30.68]I don't even need to say anything I should just put this on repeat I've made all of these noises before All of them
[04:52.71]Multiple times.
[04:54.79]It hurts.
[04:55.63]It hurts to hear this.
[04:57.07]Anyways, I don't know how this game works.
[04:59.13]It's hidden folks.
[05:03.43]It's like looking in the mirror, and I don't want to look in the mirror.
[05:07.73]It hurts my eyes.
[05:09.51]Hold on.
[05:09.93]That's better?
[05:13.01]Which one of these do you think is better?
[05:24.68]I don't like the... Jeremy, shut up for a second.
[05:28.04]I'm trying to talk.
[05:30.90]I think this one is good.
[05:33.06]Dark mode always.
[05:33.94]Yeah.
[05:34.50]He just spit on me.
[05:44.06]I'll do them all.
[05:44.80]Hey.
[05:58.61]Oh this looks worse somehow Explorer Garland is fascinated by the tongue of this reptile
[06:16.20]I mean, this is the reptile.
[06:18.14]There it is.
[06:20.08]That was... Hold on.
[06:22.16]We need less Jerma noises.
[06:24.22]It's already... Hold on.
[06:25.22]Alright, that's better.
[06:28.16]Alright.
[06:31.86]I got it.
[06:32.34]There it is.
[06:34.70]Now what do you want?
[06:38.34]Isn't that the tongue of the reptile?
[06:49.86]Now what do you want?
[06:50.60]I'm fascinated by the tongue of this reptile.
[06:56.83]This big snake is a real bush crawler.
[07:00.03]This looks worse, though.
[07:03.99]I really like this game.
[07:05.13]Hold on.
[07:12.84]Ow!
[07:15.32]That's... Hold on, what about the sepia one?
[07:21.00]This is alright.
[07:21.56]This is okay.
[07:23.22]What does yellow look like?
[07:28.00]Not bad, actually.
[07:29.15]But I need it to be a little bit darker.
[07:34.83]Yeah, this is better.
[07:36.17]Maybe I should darken it up a little?
[07:41.04]This is cool, though.
[07:43.22]Yeah, we're in night mode.
[07:46.04]Okay, so I got you.
[07:48.50]There's a brightness setting.
[07:50.16]Oh, is there?
[07:51.80]Yeah, we got this better.
[07:55.45]Alright, we can get this right.
[07:56.49]Let's do... Yep.
[07:58.89]That's what I'm thinking.
[07:59.51]That's what I'm thinking.
[08:02.63]Nope.
[08:05.15]Nope.
[08:06.75]Nope.
[08:07.73]Nope.
[08:16.07]I'm gonna- it's gonna- I don't- who's talking?
[08:25.25]This is what I'm going with right here.
[08:26.40]This is perfect.
[08:27.00]Okay, here we go.
[08:29.50]The big snake is- I look for a snake.
[08:32.54]Snake.
[08:33.34]I got the chameleon.
[08:34.68]There's a snake.
[08:36.60]Anybody see a snake?
[08:41.60]I don't see a snake.
[08:45.51]The land of the Jermas.
[08:46.75]I don't see a snake.
[08:49.84]Kiki the monkey loves a good soft shelter.
[08:55.56]I can cut stuff down?
[08:56.78]Ew.
[09:02.81]Explore Garland.
[09:08.09]Oh.
[09:09.75]Oh.
[09:10.35]Okay.
[09:11.01]I get it.
[09:13.11]I get it.
[09:13.49]I understand.
[09:14.11]Too loud?
[09:14.59]Alright, I'll fix it.
[09:20.07]I get it.
[09:20.59]Okay, so now we need to find the snake.
[09:21.95]The big snake.
[09:22.77]That's still so loud.
[09:26.81]Okay.
[09:28.53]We got a wink?
[09:41.77]Okay, now we need to find the snake.
[09:43.09]This big snake is a bush crawler.
[09:45.23]So we need to find the snake.
[09:48.63]Got the snake.
[09:49.93]Big snake.
[09:50.99]It's still so loud.
[09:53.91]You watched me fucking turn it down.
[10:04.78]Okay, now we need Kiki the monkey.
[10:08.08]It's not you?
[10:09.22]You in here?
[10:13.79]A good so- Got ya.
[10:17.75]Okay, Kiki the monkey.
[10:18.77]Now what?
[10:20.23]The only ripe white banana is pretty much up for grabs.
[10:24.67]Oh, isn't everything white in here?
[10:26.77]Like, it's- There's no- It's too loud.
[10:29.68]What do you want me to do?
[10:31.04]The only ripe white banana.
[10:38.64]Everything is- I can't- There's nothing here.
[10:42.11]Ripe banana?
[10:45.01]Pull one of these things?
[10:45.83]Oh, oh, oh!
[10:52.33]Got it.
[10:53.51]This game's fucking not even... I almost just said not even fun.
[10:57.32]I meant to say not even hard.
[10:59.50]You found everything here.
[11:00.46]Stay here a little longer.
[11:01.42]Enter the jungle.
[11:05.70]Oh, boy.
[11:06.56]Well, now this is, uh...
[11:10.91]Oh, that was the tutorial.
[11:12.55]Now we play the real game.
[11:16.69]For this man in distress, the uncomfortable seat is the least of his troubles.
[11:22.07]Got ya.
[11:22.73]Okay, what else we got?
[11:26.46]Why do we still have to hear the, like... If you ask Classy Jesse, treetop naps are the best.
[11:36.90]Treetop.
[11:39.16]There you go.
[11:42.60]This game hurts my eyes, man.
[11:52.33]Sorry.
[11:56.33]This woman with a guitar plays music that will warm the hearts of men and reptiles.
[11:59.95]Guitar.
[12:02.63]Don't even need ten seconds.
[12:04.99]Zoom, you zoomer!
[12:06.23]What do you mean?
[12:08.15]No, why would I?
[12:08.99]Oh my god.
[12:09.88]No, why would I?
[12:10.58]Oh, yeah, you can move too.
[12:11.58]Then why would I want to do that?
[12:13.66]I could see everything here.
[12:16.12]Oh no, wishes he had paid more attention during his Tai Chi classes.
[12:19.32]Is that you?
[12:25.60]No.
[12:27.24]See, why would I zoom in?
[12:28.14]Okay, then there's woohoo.
[12:39.11]I'm looking for silhouettes.
[12:40.65]That's what I'm looking for here.
[12:41.53]And I can see everything.
[12:45.17]I can scan this whole environment in one second.
[12:49.27]I'm looking for that exact silhouette.
[12:51.55]My brain has not found it yet.
[12:55.56]Silhouettes.
[12:56.34]That's all we're looking for here.
[12:57.36]There it is.
[13:05.42]Told you.
[13:11.74]Fluffy Panda does what Fluffy Pandas do, eat.
[13:14.66]Scan the environment.
[13:17.08]Okay.
[13:22.34]And end in five, four, three, two, one, action.
[13:40.52]Fluffy Panda eats.
[13:42.48]Fluffy Panda eats.
[13:46.48]Who told him to play this?
[13:48.54]Like 300 people.
[13:54.39]I'm not done with this yet.
[13:55.95]Relax.
[13:56.91]Relax.
[13:57.51]It's been five minutes.
[13:58.85]Fluffy Panda likes to eat.
[14:08.71]It's been 15, we spent five minutes introducing, six minutes picking a color, and five minutes in the game.
[14:18.99]Fluffy Panda.
[14:22.63]Oh, I forgot I can interact with the environment.
[14:27.46]Fluffy Panda eats.
[14:28.88]What is it, say it again?
[14:41.75]Where are you?
[14:44.01]I'm just destroying the whole entire forest to look for this one.
[14:47.18]Got him.
[14:51.28]Oh, I did it.
[14:52.46]Wait, stay here.
[14:54.82]There's more to do.
[14:56.34]The others watch Jealousy while King Kiki sits on his throne of bananas.
[15:03.07]Oh, wait, no.
[15:03.73]He's gonna crown.
[15:12.08]Where's the monkey with the crown?
[15:21.82]Got ya.
[15:24.43]He sits on the throne of lies.
[15:25.73]What are you talking about?
[15:28.13]Hmm.
[15:46.16]Just give us a few minutes.
[15:48.56]I like this.
[15:49.14]Alright, let's go.
[15:50.04]Let's check the next area.
[15:53.58]Help that walking folk get across.
[15:59.94]How do I do that?
[16:00.42]Are these snakes?
[16:10.21]How do I... Oh, move.
[16:12.77]Please stop.
[16:13.29]I'm high as fuck.
[16:14.07]This game's scaring me.
[16:18.14]Dude, you're fine.
[16:20.38]It's not that big of a deal.
[16:21.82]Alright, with the noises maybe, maybe I can see what you're talking about.
[16:28.71]Dude, please, I'm wicked high.
[16:35.59]What are you doing?
[16:47.93]Wait.
[16:48.83]Cut it down.
[16:53.59]Make this louder.
[16:54.35]I'm not gonna make it louder.
[16:55.46]I have to get this bridge over here.
[16:57.92]Oh, I can pull things!
[17:02.30]I have to click and hold.
[17:05.56]I like this game.
[17:12.86]Just because of this.
[17:31.45]It's just because of the Adam Sandler noises, that's why you want to keep playing.
[17:35.43]That's kind of an interesting game.
[17:43.85]That's not even an Adam Sandler noise.
[17:45.87]I'm sorry.
[17:46.31]I disagree.
[17:56.21]Dear me, this game's fucking disturbing.
[17:59.85]It's a cute little hidden object game.
[18:03.17]Why?
[18:03.43]Oh, dude, I'm on drugs.
[18:05.89]What the fuck?
[18:07.51]You can't do an activity that's in, like, an eight-year-old's book when you're, like, high, apparently?
[18:13.19]I probably can't.
[18:15.17]Yeah.
[18:15.83]The guitar is having a real good conversation with the swing.
[18:24.46]Got it.
[18:28.60]Jeremy's freaking out.
[18:29.66]Dude, you're on crack, man.
[18:31.88]Stop being... Aiden really wants to be found.
[18:33.86]Yeah, what are you smoking?
[18:39.77]What drugs are you taking?
[18:42.71]Oh, man.
[18:43.07]This wears Waldo fucking game.
[18:45.61]I can't... Oh, it's coming at me.
[18:49.27]The walls are closing now.
[18:56.01]Airbed?
[18:56.49]What?
[19:01.91]I'm too high for this, man.
[19:08.53]I love this game.
[19:09.31]Also, I had my bunny.
[19:10.61]What?
[19:11.05]What happened?
[19:11.91]Wait, what did it say?
[19:14.32]I love this game.
[19:16.20]I had my bunny since September.
[19:17.64]I have... Somebody help me name the bunny.
[19:21.20]It's an all-black bunny.
[19:22.28]How about, uh...
[19:26.22]How about... I don't know... How about... Jetson.
[19:33.73]Yeah.
[19:34.23]That's pretty good.
[19:36.09]Alright, what's this one?
[19:37.73]With filthy hands, the bullies quickly return to the campfire.
[19:42.13]Ella will never find her hairbrush.
[19:45.59]Alright, which one of the bullies has the hair... Did I not get it?
[19:53.76]With filthy hands.
[19:54.86]It's inside the fire.
[19:58.20]Pepper is pretty good.
[19:59.58]Pepper is pretty good, yeah.
[20:04.01]Where's his hairbrush?
[20:09.37]Wait.
[20:11.55]No!
[20:12.13]I thought that was gonna be in there.
[20:13.15]With filthy hands?
[20:17.54]Jerma, quick, say something funny.
[20:22.64]Sure.
[20:23.46]Ban that guy for expecting me to be his personal clown.
[20:30.53]Is that funny enough for you?
[20:36.06]Alright, I'm done.
[20:41.92]I'm not doing this anymore.
[20:42.56]This is too much.
[20:42.98]No, I'm not.
[20:47.94]I'm still here.
[20:49.40]We got a wink?
[20:49.80]Did you say I shaved?
[20:53.59]Nobody even commented on that.
[20:56.61]Why has nobody commented on the fact that I shaved?
[21:02.20]Like, I'm gonna do something and... Nobody notices it, apparently.
[21:15.31]We couldn't see.
[21:17.79]Yes, you could.
[21:18.25]Alright, where are we going?
[21:20.75]Beekeeper Barry.
[21:21.91]I'm still here.
[21:22.39]I mean, guys, everybody relax.
[21:29.59]Relax.
[21:29.91]This is the pre-game.
[21:32.37]Relax.
[21:33.29]This is the pre-game to Mega Man Legends.
[21:39.77]I wanted to play this for a little bit.
[21:42.04]Guys, everybody just cool.
[21:43.94]Just cool off.
[21:49.42]You have an Instagram filter on.
[21:50.92]I do not have an Instagram filter on.
[21:52.80]I don't even know how to use that.
[21:59.34]Bee Keeper, Bee Keeper Berry.
[22:00.64]Alright, there's the bees.
[22:05.66]Bee Keeper Berry, where is he?
[22:10.62]Bee Keeper Berry.
[22:13.08]Fuck, I'm getting interested.
[22:13.92]There it is.
[22:25.94]Am I making the bee sounds?
[22:27.06]No.
[22:27.30]What if I just stay here for like five hours and just play this all day?
[22:30.22]Am I?
[22:32.36]Alright, what's this?
[22:39.79]Mai releases every butterfly she catches.
[22:41.67]That's why there's still so many of them here.
[22:43.31]Oh, nope.
[22:59.62]Where are you?
[23:01.20]Where are you?
[23:02.12]You're going to only have one viewer, me.
[23:12.61]I'm not even watching my own stream.
[23:14.03]What you meant to say was zero.
[23:17.25]That means I would have to have my own stream open, which I don't.
[23:20.86]Let me just find Mai, please.
[23:25.40]I want to check this game out.
[23:28.46]I got Mega Man Legends sitting in the tray right now.
[23:38.13]What tray?
[23:38.61]In the PS2 tray.
[23:44.87]I like this game.
[23:46.81]You guys are too harsh.
[23:47.49]Where are the butterflies?
[23:56.80]Wait!
[23:59.18]I see a butterfly right here.
[24:01.45]That's a clue.
[24:05.11]You fostered this harshness.
[24:08.33]Don't blame me.
[24:09.19]I'm playing the game.
[24:12.39]I'm playing this game.
[24:13.63]I like this game.
[24:15.39]What do you mean?
[24:16.13]If I was fostering something, I'd be fostering you enjoying this game because I like it.
[24:21.98]That's me fostering.
[24:35.35]I gotta find this person.
[24:38.92]No Mega Man until I find this person.
[24:44.35]By liking the game, you make chat hate it.
[24:46.17]What am I, your parents?
[24:49.89]What?
[24:53.54]Dude, I found this really cool game today called Hidden Folks.
[24:56.33]No way, dude.
[24:56.97]Is it fun?
[24:57.49]Yeah, it's so cool, dude.
[24:59.45]You like find monsters and pigs and there's fucking people here.
[25:03.73]Dude, that's awesome.
[25:05.52]Let's play it.
[25:05.98]Oh, I'm so into it.
[25:06.80]We're both hitting or hovering over our desk.
[25:09.86]Fucking door opens.
[25:12.16]What are you boys doing in there?
[25:13.36]Oh, we're just playing this game called Hidden Folks.
[25:16.07]My, you wouldn't even like it if you were any older.
[25:19.27]Oh, oh, hidden folks.
[25:20.53]What are you looking for?
[25:21.46]Mai?
[25:22.50]Oh, she's right over here.
[25:23.36]Ding!
[25:26.98]Boys, if you need help with anything else, especially with Lumberjack Fleck, I know where that is too.
[25:30.58]I beat this game last night.
[25:33.56]Fuck out of here, Ma.
[25:34.54]Fine.
[25:35.04]Um... I don't even like this game, Ma.
[25:38.25]Hey, Mike, do you like this game?
[25:41.65]Uh, yeah.
[25:42.85]You do?
[25:43.25]Fucking loser.
[25:44.71]No, I don't.
[25:45.29]This game's a fucking loser.
[25:46.43]Yeah, I don't like it either.
[25:54.02]What am I doing right now?
[25:54.98]Alright, I'm like projecting.
[25:57.94]I'm fostering some hatred here on you guys.
[26:01.36]Alright, alright, alright.
[26:03.12]Alright, let's go.
[26:04.98]I'm gonna play Mega Man Legends.
[26:13.26]But I have to find these people first.
[26:17.20]I'm not leaving until I find the bat.
[26:19.36]I don't care.
[26:20.42]I don't care if every single person leaves the stream.
[26:22.42]I'm gonna beat this level.
[26:37.39]Every butterfly she catches, that's why there's still so many of them.
[26:42.81]Found the bat.
[26:49.19]Monster Moe.
[26:53.47]Hmm.
[26:54.40]Alright, what about this one?
[26:54.98]We'll go back to this.
[26:55.68]Peyton tried to escape the internet, but he put his tent next to the only Wi-Fi point of the campground.
[27:01.96]Is there a cell tower here?
[27:10.00]Oh, I found her.
[27:11.68]Bling.
[27:18.94]Oh.
[27:19.75]Hayden tried to escape the internet.
[27:22.49]Come on, it's over here.
[27:26.75]The campground's over here, right?
[27:28.85]No, the campground's down here.
[27:31.35]Oh, there's the Wi-Fi spot.
[27:35.60]Where is he?
[27:39.66]Is that a secret?
[27:40.38]No.
[27:42.06]There you are.
[27:43.52]Got it.
[27:45.66]Mom, can we please play Mega Man?
[27:49.26]No.
[27:50.00]Not until you've done your homework, which is... Watch this guy play Hidden Folks.
[27:56.56]As your only assignment.
[27:58.44]You can't even do that?
[28:00.58]What the heck?
[28:03.76]No ice cream for you after dinner.
[28:07.04]Look at this dog.
[28:10.89]The sun is shining too brightly today, even for classy Jessie.
[28:17.09]That's not her.
[28:20.15]Cruel and unusual punishment.
[28:23.38]Key.
[28:25.56]This is satisfying.
[28:29.42]This is a really satisfying game.
[28:31.54]What about this one?
[28:32.54]Lumberjack?
[28:35.07]What's that?
[28:37.81]The sun is shining too brightly.
[28:39.21]No.
[28:46.51]On like a beach?
[28:53.52]Camping.
[28:57.76]In the car?
[28:58.26]Maybe you're in the car.
[28:59.98]No.
[29:12.27]I don't know where she is.
[29:18.29]This is kind of fucked up, by the way.
[29:19.59]I'm just some otherworldly force opening up everybody's tents.
[29:39.19]no no no no wait come on where are you right here nope no oh chat vote on this it's not this you don't vote on an unofficial poll
[30:04.83]Guys, the unofficial poll is the same thing as, as... Alright, if you guys all... Unofficial poll.
[30:14.66]That's like, that's like watching a TV show and being like, oh man, I really hope they, I really hope they kill off this character next.
[30:22.64]Let's all vote for it and send it to the fucking CEO at Disney.
[30:27.83]CEO at Disney's gonna read it and be like, what's this?
[30:31.09]Who they want, who they want to see die next to the show?
[30:36.04]I would throw it in the trash, but I get fucking a hundred of these a week and the trash is full every day.
[30:42.24]So I'm just going to rip it in half.
[30:45.76]Recycle this, please.
[30:55.49]Where is this person?
[31:02.77]At least he's recycling.
[31:07.82]Not realistic.
[31:08.52]Disney CEO wouldn't recycle.
[31:14.15]She's classy.
[31:14.93]Yeah, but what does that mean?
[31:16.63]What do you mean, look at the results?
[31:31.24]Where are the... What is the poll?
[31:32.30]Let me see it.
[31:32.84]Let me see it.
[31:38.89]It says, uh, do you think Jerma could beat this game?
[31:42.99]No, OMEGALUL, yes.
[31:44.51]Oh, I see what's going on here.
[31:45.79]Okay, this is a really interesting part of the stream.
[31:48.96]This is, um, like a thousand of you.
[31:51.76]This is very interesting.
[31:52.98]So, like, probably like 700 of you are like, no, I want him to keep fucking playing this game.
[31:58.99]Like, I like this game.
[31:59.85]This is a kind of cool experience.
[32:01.14]This is like fun to me.
[32:03.40]So let's say, let's make him think he can't beat it.
[32:05.96]So then he stays and tries to prove us wrong.
[32:07.86]It works with the Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring.
[32:10.27]It has to work with something like this because he's already interested.
[32:12.43]It's not going to work.
[32:14.43]I already know that.
[32:27.29]The sun is shining too brightly.
[32:28.69]Are there more than one campground?
[32:41.92]It's working.
[32:43.38]Chat, keep up the pressure.
[32:44.64]That's not...
[32:59.99]Classy Jesse found.
[33:03.48]Anybody who likes this game also... I'm not reading the rest of that.
[33:06.64]What the fuck are you talking about?
[33:09.94]Lumberjack... Alright, we got one more.
[33:11.20]Lumberjack Flex stands in front of his grand final challenge.
[33:14.34]It's a forest, or a tree, or wood, or cutting, or... Is it a huge tree or something?
[33:23.11]I mean, there's a bunch of trees...
[33:34.85]Zoom out.
[33:35.21]Where's a big tree?
[33:37.93]That's pretty big.
[33:38.45]That's pretty big.
[33:41.17]Not that big, though.
[33:42.67]That!
[33:43.17]There it is.
[33:43.95]He's blind.
[33:46.52]He's blind.
[33:47.02]He's blind.
[33:47.52]He's blind.
[33:47.98]He's blind.
[33:48.48]He's blind.
[33:48.96]He's blind.
[33:49.48]No, I can't move on.
[33:54.38]Oh, shit.
[33:55.86]This banana was parked into a fruit basket.
[34:01.15]What about this one?
[34:02.17]This truffle is about to be discovered by a hog.
[34:07.32]Together with her bunny friends, Black Bitty hides in a hole chewing on some snatched wheat.
[34:14.86]Ivan hitched a ride without permission.
[34:16.20]It doesn't have an escape plan.
[34:18.54]What the fuck is this?
[34:20.68]What are you guys doing right now?
[34:27.89]I don't get it.
[34:28.33]I don't understand.
[34:33.85]What does this have to do with anything going on right now?
[34:44.31]Is that what you think I'm doing right now?
[34:56.26]Somebody wrote, LUL, fuck chat, do what you want to do.
[34:59.58]Oh, I am.
[35:05.58]See, I said Mega Man Legends was coming, but I don't even own that game.
[35:10.96]I just made that up completely.
[35:12.70]I don't have that.
[35:16.80]This spider has a particular ta- Alright, there's a spider over here.
[35:19.15]You know what I'm saying?
[35:24.73]Like, I don't even fucking own it.
[35:31.51]Fuck me.
[35:31.75]I don't even own Mega Man Legends.
[35:36.89]I just own Mega Man Legends 2.
[35:39.64]Let's see if I can have the sequel and not the first one.
[35:54.30]What's wrong with my floor?
[35:57.48]I just picked up the PlayStation 2 controller instead of the mouse.
[36:03.54]Ta-da!
[36:04.02]Hey, nice to see you.
[36:09.65]It's time for Mega Man.
[36:10.55]It's not time for Mega Man.
[36:11.94]You'll know when it's time for Mega Man.
[36:15.30]Here's how you know it's time for me to switch a game.
[36:18.62]I usually don't talk for about 30 straight seconds.
[36:22.20]I go, alright, um, okay, that's, uh, that's cool.
[36:27.81]I haven't done that yet.
[36:33.91]Usually it's a lot of
[36:35.92]Um, alright.
[36:37.40]Where's this thing?
[36:38.68]Hmm, cool.
[36:41.42]Like, when you hear me, fill airtime.
[36:43.96]Because, like, there's nothing interesting going on for me in the game, or I have nothing interesting to tell you.
[36:48.24]That's how you know, like, to start the countdown for about five minutes.
[36:50.52]Alright.
[36:55.82]Rockpile.
[36:56.96]Rockpile.
[37:00.05]Hmm.
[37:00.31]Hmm.
[37:05.23]Dog.
[37:05.77]Cool dog.
[37:07.13]Yeah, saying things that I'm currently touching or what just the actual noun.
[37:12.11]That's how you know it's like the person's done with the game they're playing.
[37:16.25]Because I'm a streamer, right?
[37:17.15]So it's like, is it just dead air?
[37:18.69]No, I'm not gonna have dead air.
[37:23.03]Tractor.
[37:25.09]Riding along in the tractor.
[37:26.84]Beep, beep.
[37:29.70]You know, tractors.
[37:33.02]That's how you know.
[37:36.16]And this is not just me.
[37:36.94]This is every streamer you've ever watched.
[37:39.54]You'll see it.
[37:40.22]You can see it now.
[37:40.82]You'll know.
[37:41.12]Alright, Ivan hitched a ride without permission.
[37:48.17]Doesn't have an escape plan.
[37:49.01]So he's over here.
[37:52.97]He's like under one of the cars.
[37:55.69]That's not him?
[38:00.98]Hitch to ride without permission.
[38:02.80]Uh-oh.
[38:03.58]Saying the thing like this.
[38:07.52]Saying any word or phrase like this.
[38:10.02]Okay.
[38:12.70]Hitch to ride without permission.
[38:14.32]No.
[38:15.36]Alright.
[38:17.32]I'm not doing that anymore.
[38:18.29]Alright.
[38:18.53]Where is he?
[38:28.45]Where is he?
[38:28.87]Over here?
[38:30.85]Nope.
[38:31.55]He's lying down somewhere.
[38:37.08]Wow.
[38:37.44]Wow.
[38:59.29]If he was gonna be somewhere, he'd be down here.
[39:03.89]It's Beaker?
[39:07.45]No, that's not Beaker.
[39:09.87]Let's get him to do a whole symphony, though.
[39:13.11]Cover your ears, it's probably gonna hurt.
[39:15.01]Hmm.
[39:20.86]Can't figure out what's Jerma and what's this game.
[39:23.74]What's Jerma?
[39:25.04]What's Jerma?
[39:26.42]Well, what's Jerma?
[39:31.16]I can help you out there.
[39:32.78]What's Jerma?
[39:33.54]What's Jerma?
[39:35.98]Well, that's a good question.
[39:39.95]If I were to think, let me... Well, let's answer the second question first.
[39:45.21]Second question is, this is Hidden Folks.
[39:47.81]A game about hidden objects.
[39:50.50]But here's the thing.
[39:53.94]What is Jerma?
[40:08.60]Hey, you, person that just landed on the channel page, what's going on?
[40:11.54]My name is Jerma985, or you can just call me Jerma, that's what most people around here call me.
[40:16.60]I'm a gaming channel, you probably could guess that by all the different playlists and all the videos below, which you should check out and you should go watch some of them right now, and possibly subscribe.
[40:26.73]That's the whole purpose of this video, I'm trying to get you to subscribe to my channel, so hey...
[40:30.60]Subscribe to the channel!
[40:31.68]Subscribe to the- You see, on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jerma, because I have two different sides.
[40:38.90]I have the very professional side, where I review content, I review packages.
[40:44.03]What?
[40:44.29]I don't review packages.
[40:45.19]No, I don't do that!
[40:46.09]I review, like, games.
[40:47.39]Oh, here's a cup.
[40:49.27]This cup is good.
[40:50.55]There's a whole lot of stuff here, though.
[40:51.83]I have my fun, I have my professional side, and I mold them together.
[40:57.10]into sort of this lunacy that is Jerma985.
[41:00.70]So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an explanation of why you subscribe as well.
[41:06.81]So please subscribe, subscribe, and subscribe.
[41:10.55]And I'll subscribe you all next time.
[41:12.15]And of course, subscribe, subscribe.
[41:14.30]Bye.
[41:14.98]Oh, I hate it.
[41:16.48]I hate it.
[41:18.99]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[41:20.45]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[41:22.01]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[41:23.51]Jerma here.
[41:24.35]Who is this guy anyway?
[41:26.07]Gameplay commentary.
[41:27.57]Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[41:30.43]I don't know where the statue is.
[41:31.85]It'll play this game.
[41:32.75]No way, I'm going to bang.
[41:33.88]No, what?
[41:35.24]Oh, what was that?
[41:35.74]You were going to bang?
[41:36.80]What?
[41:37.08]What were you going to do?
[41:38.10]You were going to bang me?
[41:38.80]Is that what you said?
[41:40.28]Oh, there we go.
[41:42.06]Oh.
[41:43.34]So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because you can jump real high.
[41:49.48]Never understood that, by the way.
[41:51.09]Why does Mario have to do everything?
[41:53.05]He's like the savior of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.
[41:57.35]Right, but that's why.
[41:59.03]Left or right.
[41:59.84]We're gonna go left.
[42:02.12]Oh, man!
[42:08.65]Fucking scary game.
[42:10.09]I knew it!
[42:10.85]I knew it was gonna happen, too, and it still doesn't matter.
[42:14.07]What I'm talking about here is, you'll see it, I go like... Almost like I'm sweeping the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys.
[42:23.02]And it's something, I don't know why I do this.
[42:24.98]And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse, more so than I do with just kind of getting people in front of my crosshair.
[42:31.72]But I kill every single person, almost, by doing the sway, in quotes.
[42:36.40]Cupid!
[42:43.32]Oh, now I'm dead.
[42:45.32]Who did this?
[42:47.24]Okay, I don't want to alarm anybody here, but I'm sorry I may have taken a shit in your house.
[42:52.10]Being one of the top 10 players in the world... That's right, this is Jerma's grandfather here.
[42:58.12]Not Jerma, he's not as good as me.
[43:00.04]He can't give you the tips.
[43:01.53]He can't give you the strategies that I can.
[43:03.95]So let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world.
[43:07.43]And I'll show you right here.
[43:08.39]Look at this.
[43:08.83]Get the fuck out of here, buddy.
[43:11.53]Let me tell you.
[43:13.06]Did I really have this in me the whole time?
[43:15.66]And the answer is yes.
[43:17.06]Yes.
[43:17.42]Everybody does.
[43:18.32]We all do.
[43:19.12]Everybody has it in them.
[43:20.68]You have it in you.
[43:21.48]You do.
[43:21.82]Do it.
[43:22.02]You can actually do it.
[43:23.21]Go.
[43:23.55]You just have to tell yourself it's possible and you have to act on those possibilities.
[43:32.85]Oh, what a sick trick.

[45:15.64]Alright, anyways, what were we doing?
[45:17.56]So, the person that just came in, what is, what is Jerma, I don't get it, and what is this?
[45:20.96]Hopefully we answered both those questions.
[45:23.12]You probably left 15 seconds into that video, but if you're still here, thanks for watching.

[45:39.81]What do you mean it's right here?
[45:40.57]This video shouldn't be public.
[45:52.93]Actually, the video should not be public.
[45:54.65]I don't know, whatever.
[46:00.11]The video has like 30,000 views.

[46:47.20]Hey, thanks for subscribing to the channel.
[46:54.64]Alright, I need... I gotta level with the chat here for a second.
[46:57.72]A lot of you guys might be newer viewers.
[46:58.96]Listen to me.
[47:00.84]There was a time... I'll get on cam for this.
[47:05.14]There was a time between 2010 and like 2013 where I didn't even swear on this channel.
[47:13.33]I didn't know what I wanted the channel to be.
[47:15.99]I didn't know if I wanted the channel to be a channel where I was a professional reviewer or something.
[47:22.09]This is like, nobody knew what the fuck they were doing back in like 2012.
[47:26.31]No one.
[47:28.13]Not one person did.
[47:30.44]And now this formula is for all this shit now.
[47:33.72]It is where everybody's at.
[47:35.50]Everyone's got the perfect way to do everything now.
[47:38.64]Ten years ago, it was like, there were people watching my YouTube channel.
[47:45.85]Why?
[47:46.37]What do I do?
[47:47.21]Wait, what?
[47:47.87]How many people clicked on that video?
[47:50.63]Why did they click on that video?
[47:53.41]Should I do more of that?
[47:54.91]What should I do?
[47:55.87]Should I do another TF2 video?
[47:59.33]I'm going to do this Grandpa video, I think.
[48:02.45]Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.
[48:04.70]I hope.
[48:05.54]And then you make videos like that, trying to like... It was different.
[48:10.58]It was the Wild West.
[48:13.81]I never did clickbait videos.
[48:15.21]No, I didn't.
[48:15.97]No fucking way.
[48:17.37]Not in a million years.
[48:18.83]No, I did not.
[48:19.77]I refuse to believe that.
[48:25.28]When did I do a clickbait video?
[48:31.40]I never, ever, ever did that.
[48:38.63]haha oh god haha oh god is me not knowing what I want to title a video not clickbait that's I have no title for this so it's gonna be uh TF2 um uncensored uh Jerma haha oh god I don't have any other words to describe the video so I'm just gonna write haha oh god give me clickbait TF2 bring on the thunder
[49:09.14]That's not clickbait.
[49:09.94]That happened.
[49:13.47]I got clickbaited in that video.
[49:15.53]Don't you understand?
[49:15.99]The purpose of this video was I was clickbaited.
[49:20.05]I was baited in this video, and I was very upset by it. ...
[49:35.02]Watch it on stream.
[49:36.06]No, no, I'm trying to... Hold on.
[49:38.46]Let me get through level one of Find the Hidden People.
[49:44.09]Somebody said, what about the video where you said this is the scariest game ever?
[49:46.61]I really thought it was.
[49:54.86]I really thought it was.
[49:56.42]It was the scariest game ever.
[49:58.40]And the reason why I thought it was the scariest game ever... Okay, if you were to go back to, like, the 1700s, and you brought a DVD of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill, and you gave it, and you brought a TV, and you plugged it in somehow, you got it to work, and you watched, you showed, like, the Pilgrims fucking Jack and Jill...
[50:19.85]They would be like, holy fuck, this is the most insane, ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.
[50:23.40]This is called a movie?
[50:25.14]That's the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
[50:28.68]Because they didn't have any other experiences watching any other movies.
[50:34.48]So, I didn't play that many scary games, so that was the scariest game I had played.
[50:40.50]But there was a million of the scary games that I hadn't played yet.
[50:42.68]They had Shakespeare.
[50:47.43]That doesn't matter.
[50:48.01]I have a magical box that plays Adam Sandler on a TV.
[50:54.01]This one is actually clickbait.
[50:55.81]No, it's not.
[50:56.73]I can explain all of them.
[50:58.90]What is it?
[50:59.20]I didn't make this video.
[51:06.04]I didn't make this video.
[51:18.78]requested games that you see in this chat.
[51:23.06]I'm just gonna get it over with.
[51:25.04]Because... Wait, hold on.
[51:30.58]Wait, everybody settle down for a second.
[51:32.34]I gotta get this... Okay, hold on.
[51:37.03]I can rebuttal this.
[51:37.73]I really can.
[51:40.77]You give me any of these, I'll rebuttal them. ...
[51:52.04]No!
[51:52.20]I didn't even get paid for that.
[51:54.16]Okay.
[52:21.25]It's based on a bunch of fucking animated characters.
[52:25.07]You know, like your fucking anime bullshit that everybody seems to like these days.
[52:28.84]Animated character.
[52:34.60]Can't wait.
[52:38.88]And this is... We're just gonna get it over with real quick.
[52:41.56]And of course I'm talking... Of course I'm talking about Garfield Car.
[52:45.10]How's that clickbait?

[79:38.79]Why would you make this?
[79:42.27]What?
[79:55.00]Okay.
[79:55.78]No.
[79:55.86]It's the fact that it's coming out of the coat.
[80:01.72]He's like 5'5".
[80:03.62]He's like 5'6".
[80:04.28]Why is it like a person?
[80:06.08]What are you doing?
[80:29.12]Okay.
[80:30.83]No.
[80:31.61]Community crack night.
[80:32.71]No.
[80:33.13]It is kind of.
[80:35.01]I hope to god that's not the thumbnail.
[80:36.63]Because that would be really fucked up.
[80:39.91]No.
[80:40.13]I'm doing too much fucked up shit on the stream.
[80:45.21]Alright.
[80:45.67]Too many.
[80:46.03]Alright.
[80:46.49]We gotta dial back the fucked up stuff.
[80:49.20]Okay.
[80:49.90]Okay.
[80:56.25]Look, as many as the Joker, it's full moon.
[80:59.19]It's just constant images.
[81:04.88]I said it was going to be crazy, and I shouldn't have said that.
[81:08.16]I should have said it was going to be chill.
[81:12.10]Constant conflict.
[81:15.65]No, I saw that one.
[81:21.13]It's not the thumbnail.
[81:24.91]Alright, where's this fish?
[81:28.69]This rotting fish is repelling potential customers.
[81:34.21]Hmm.
[81:35.27]Well, here's the market down here.
[81:36.69]Do you really want to live forever?
[81:49.44]Come on, where is it?
[81:58.53]Here's a fish.
[81:59.21]It has to be close, right?
[82:06.69]Drawing away potential colors.
[82:07.69]There's like a trash can somewhere.
[82:08.97]This rotting fish.
[82:17.40]Thank you.
[82:43.82]It's fake.
[82:51.07]Okay.
[82:51.69]Good.
[82:54.99]Alright.
[82:55.31]I got to turn.
[82:55.93]I got to mute.
[83:06.77]Where's this fish?
[83:16.71]What does it mean, like, Twitch staff?
[83:26.52]And scrolling by that thumbnail?
[83:30.28]Be like, I gotta click on this one.
[83:38.40]Where's this fish?
[83:40.38]What the hell is this?
[83:52.37]It's right here somewhere, has to be.
[83:57.72]Come on, where is it?
[84:08.49]Shit.
[84:17.15]Is there another market?
[84:20.89]Scaring off potential customers.
[84:22.74]Oh, wait.
[84:24.18]What's going on down here?
[84:26.66]There's only two.
[84:31.06]There's a scarecrow and this fish and then needle.
[84:35.34]Oh, got you.
[84:37.36]No, shit.
[84:38.12]Really?
[84:38.36]There you are.
[84:46.65]Staff is here.
[84:47.43]Uh-oh.
[84:49.23]Everybody, quick!
[84:50.69]Duck!
[84:55.86]I keep passing the fish.
[85:07.97]Well, I found that.
[85:08.55]That's good.
[85:12.79]No, don't scatter.
[85:13.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[85:14.43]Just, just, everybody, just...
[85:16.65]I'm having a family reunion party, okay?
[85:18.56]We're all family here.
[85:19.46]You have brothers, sisters, cousins, your relatives.
[85:23.42]This is like thousands of us.
[85:24.46]We do it every year.
[85:25.36]Shit, stop.
[85:26.20]Stop.
[85:26.62]Shut up.
[85:26.86]Alright, fuck it.
[85:34.71]I'm going to the next one.
[85:37.87]Fabian wants to get back to the festival, but the signs aren't helping him.
[85:43.12]Oh, God.
[85:43.72]Oh, this is not going to be good.
[85:45.68]Phone?
[85:53.60]Shit, this is... Look at how huge this is.
[86:03.86]Oh, this is so big.
[86:05.08]New here.
[86:07.94]Is this the Twitch?
[86:08.64]Okay.
[86:09.30]Okay.
[86:11.38]Well, the signs aren't helping.
[86:12.30]Found him.
[86:13.38]Got you.
[86:14.38]Fabian, I got you.
[86:17.16]What are you guys doing?
[86:33.68]Dude, you know the thing?
[86:35.22]You ever heard the phrase, like, don't ever post anything on the internet?
[86:40.64]You ever heard that before?
[86:45.21]So, I had like a cute moment with my girlfriend.
[86:49.45]And it's been ruined forever.
[86:56.55]Don't ever post anything on the internet.
[87:00.82]Let this be a real lesson for you.
[87:05.11]What you see on the screen right now should be a warning.
[87:08.30]Don't tell anybody fucking who you are.
[87:11.28]Don't give them any photos.
[87:12.72]Don't send anybody a picture.
[87:13.90]Don't ever take a picture.
[87:15.31]Never take a picture ever again.
[87:16.65]Unless it's on a disposable camera and you have the originals.
[87:20.05]You have the negatives.
[87:34.69]Why are there so many of these?
[87:40.23]I wanted to see him kiss the dog again from staff.
[87:50.22]Oh, my God.
[87:52.52]Fuck.
[87:54.08]Fuck.
[87:55.32]Okay.
[87:56.67]It's real, by the way.
[87:58.13]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[88:01.29]Is it bait?
[88:03.22]Yeah, no, this is a test.
[88:04.70]No, this is a test.
[88:05.41]I don't want to fail the test.
[88:14.57]Like, I want to see him kiss the dog again.
[88:17.49]He's got his finger hovering over the 72-hour suspension.
[88:26.33]Alright, what's this one?
[88:29.75]Chief Koto was standing up a minute ago.
[88:33.65]Standing up a minute ago.
[88:37.48]So, what does that mean?
[88:39.14]Standing up a minute ago?
[88:53.36]Is it... Flying down?
[88:54.54]Axe in that one.
[88:55.50]Oh, you guys really...
[89:11.02]Why are we airing... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:13.27]Why are we airing all... Why are we airing all the grievances of this stream?
[89:17.53]Why are we... Why are you guys trying to get me to get in trouble?
[89:20.09]You guys are just... Why are you gaslighting Twitch staff into making me... Like, investigate me?
[89:28.14]Why?
[89:28.50]What are you doing?
[89:38.89]Hey dude, I took two weeks ago.
[89:40.45]Yeah, you should check the timestamp here.
[89:42.37]Check that out.
[89:45.17]Yeah, serves you right, Jeremy, for playing Hidden Folks on board.
[89:49.65]Hey, you're gonna get, what?
[90:02.60]Whatever, they ain't gonna find anything.
[90:07.31]Hey, don't let this chat gaslight you, Steph.
[90:16.32]It's fucking lit.
[90:18.24]Fortnite arms up and down, leaning forward and back.
[90:22.93]Okay, so you're pulling a vlog of everything I told you guys.
[90:27.08]What did I fucking tell you?
[90:28.78]What did I tell you?
[90:29.86]I specifically made this.
[90:32.02]Use this as an example.
[90:33.94]Everything you've ever written on this website is logged.
[90:36.74]All of it.
[90:37.74]Every single thing you've ever said is tied to you.
[90:43.43]Somebody just pulled that back.
[90:44.71]That was like four months ago.
[90:48.63]It's all here.
[90:51.81]Let me be the example for you.
[90:56.75]One horn wasn't enough for Scavenger Fury Max.
[90:59.27]Wait, the sombrero cactus resides somewhere on the outskirts of the desert.
[91:05.93]Who's this?
[91:06.91]Oh, wait.
[91:14.12]Something going on out here?
[91:21.46]Help.
[91:25.00]Do we help them?
[91:33.91]What the fuck?
[91:41.43]It's fucking two hours until this Joker streams.
[91:43.55]PST more this pissing shit time.
[91:45.39]Grow up.
[91:48.29]No, guys, that would...
[91:51.02]That was me quoting someone.
[91:53.98]I didn't say that.
[91:54.72]That was me saying, hey, look at what this crazy person wrote.
[92:00.01]I didn't say that.
[92:00.73]I'm not crazy.
[92:01.89]Not me.
[92:10.76]Not me.
[92:11.86]I'm normal.
[92:12.44]I'm very normal.
[92:13.82]I'm exceptionally normal.
[92:16.54]I'll prove it to you right now.
[92:22.59]Hello?
[92:25.69]How are you?
[92:27.56]I'm doing very well.
[92:30.32]You see the Red Sox last night?
[92:33.66]Yeah, they did a very good job.
[92:35.12]I can't believe they're trading for... Bronson Arroyo.
[92:39.98]Also... I...
[92:51.06]My anniversary tonight with my girlfriend.
[92:53.20]This should be really fun.
[92:56.42]I'm going to go out and maybe to dinner.
[93:00.08]I will, you know, I do very normal things with me and my girlfriend.
[93:08.64]We just go do things.
[93:11.97]I'll be wearing a suit.
[93:15.59]With a bathing suit underneath.
[93:17.39]Just in case you never know when you're gonna get invited to, like, go to a pool.
[93:20.21]Or go into water.
[93:22.03]You gotta be ready.
[93:23.63]Hold on, did Twitch staff just give a hundred community subs?
[93:31.51]Did Link, the Twitch staffer, oops, misclick?
[93:40.12]Holy shit.
[93:47.95]Wow.
[93:48.75]That's a lot of fucking subs.
[93:51.23]Link, what are you doing?
[93:57.06]That's insane.
[93:58.14]Link gaming.
[94:05.10]Dude, Link gaming?! !
[94:11.81]No, thank you.
[94:14.39]Thank you for the 100 community subs, which I will take as a free pass to have dog kiss images on my stream.
[94:22.75]Alright, good.
[94:29.83]Free pass granted.
[94:36.31]No, thank you.
[94:36.95]Seriously.
[94:37.85]That's a ton of money.
[94:40.50]All our hopes are for this one plant to grow here in the desert.
[94:43.16]Don't drown it.
[94:45.86]I failed the test?
[94:47.86]Uh-oh.
[94:53.77]Dog kiss pass.
[94:56.57]Ooh!
[94:57.83]This lone vulture ate literally everything around him.
[94:59.77]Everything.
[95:05.29]Is this a vulture or is this every Justin Roiland character?
[95:22.69]What's going on down here?
[95:29.27]Funny stuff, dude.
[95:34.39]So where is it?
[95:37.69]I will tell you that Justin Roiland is so good at doing a loud, high-pitched scream.
[95:44.58]No one will ever be able to do that.
[95:46.46]No one will ever be able to do that, like... Yeah, I can't.
[95:50.96]No one can do it.
[95:51.50]Only he can.
[95:52.40]No one else can ever do that.
[95:53.44]Ever.
[95:54.10]To ever live.
[95:58.27]I can't even try it because it'll be embarrassing because it wouldn't even be close.
[96:06.39]S.O.S.
[96:14.86]The trail ends here.
[96:15.79]Aladdin surfs the mild winds across the desert like nothing weird is happening.
[96:28.37]Someone send help.
[96:30.70]Oh, shit.
[96:32.22]I found you.
[96:32.58]This is Eric.
[96:34.34]That would have been so hard to find that.
[96:44.17]alright uh free max glasses it was the I'm right here just I can help it was only the woman's glasses the three vultures didn't eat alright I gotta find hold on hear my help I'm trapped in my bathroom um
[97:07.50]Start at the beginning of your bathroom and do a false sprint and then put shoulder in the door.
[97:13.63]Don't do that.
[97:24.82]What do you want me to say?
[97:25.88]Do you have access to a phone?
[97:29.37]No?
[97:32.38]Can you not slip something in the lock on your side to open it?
[97:36.92]Is the door completely lodged?
[97:38.59]You have no access to anything.
[97:39.75]Do you have a window in that room?
[97:42.51]No.
[97:43.79]You don't have access to the window.
[97:46.58]There's no window.
[97:47.28]Alright, well, that's weird, okay?
[97:49.64]So how are you going to get out of it?
[97:50.62]What do you want me to tell you?
[97:52.96]Lie on your back.
[97:54.72]If you're in a scenario where you're stuck, it's trapped, and you can't get out, and there's literally no one to help you.
[97:59.20]Lie on your back, and put your knees at a 90 degree angle at the door, and just like infant-toddler tantrum, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with both heels into the door until it opens.
[98:11.24]What do you want me to tell- Why are you asking me for this advice?
[98:13.66]What do you want me to tell you?
[98:25.32]Is it made out of wood?
[98:26.20]Probably.
[98:26.66]Mega Man Legends 2 looks great.
[98:37.43]That boat sailed like an hour ago.
[98:41.57]I will prove that I own it, though.
[98:44.21]Here it is.
[98:45.35]I will prove that I own it.
[98:47.50]That's the Lord of the Rings.
[98:48.74]I'll prove that I own it.
[98:49.60]Okay.
[99:03.86]There it is.
[99:05.02]That's like the serial number.
[99:07.60]Wait, what's this?
[99:10.06]Oh, there's like a Capcom hint telephone number.
[99:16.01]I fucking hate that.
[99:18.81]He's got Lego hair.
[99:19.69]No, I do not.
[99:20.25]Not today.
[99:21.15]Bullshit.
[99:22.69]Bullshit.
[99:23.39]Do I?
[99:24.01]No, I don't, actually.
[99:25.25]This is normal human hair.
[99:28.34]Normal human hair today.
[99:29.58]This is hair.
[99:30.20]This is just human hair.
[99:32.93]Now I've made it to let go here.
[99:42.62]This is what a normal person looks like.
[99:45.28]This is what a normal person looks like if you saw me on the train.
[99:48.36]Alright, if you saw me on the train, if we were on the fucking train together and you saw me like this, you wouldn't do anything.
[99:55.77]That's a normal person.
[99:59.33]He's doing an alien monolog.
[100:07.77]This must be the right oasis.
[100:08.87]Treasure hunter.
[100:09.63]Open sesame, open sesame, open ses- Nope, this rocky door needs a different kind of magic.
[100:20.21]I'm gonna start wearing like a mustache.
[100:22.44]I can't grow a mustache, so I'm gonna start wearing like a fake mustache.
[100:27.06]Alright, we gotta find this, um... We gotta find the vultures.
[100:31.12]Vultures, vultures, vultures.
[100:34.77]If I saw you on a train, I'd say, is that Jerma from Jermacraft?
[100:38.21]You would not do that.
[100:39.01]This chat's full of vultures.
[100:54.54]I didn't say that, you did.
[100:59.74]Would you cringe if someone actually did that to you?
[101:04.41]No, I wouldn't.
[101:05.51]I would laugh.
[101:06.37]I'd be like, oh, that's funny.
[101:09.63]And then I would get off at the next stop, even if I didn't have to get off at that stop, even if it meant I got in a taxi cab for 30 minutes to go to where I was going.
[101:29.76]What is this?
[101:30.86]This has been a fun stream.
[101:33.80]This has been like the chat takes over stream.
[101:35.86]And I'm alright with it.
[101:37.50]I think it's fun.
[101:44.15]It's Lego hair again.
[101:45.15]That's alright.
[101:47.47]What dead people?
[101:48.09]This has been a downward spiral?
[101:56.27]I don't think so.
[101:56.73]I think this has been an upward spiral.
[102:01.93]Wait, open sesame?
[102:06.05]Martin waits for the music to kick in, but he will dance primarily on the inside.
[102:16.67]No, no, no, no, no.
[102:19.99]What about these animals?
[102:21.36]This bottle of water could save your life in the dunes of the desert.
[102:27.02]Bottle of water.
[102:30.66]Alright, I've got to focus on one thing at a time here.

[104:08.00]What's with the rocks?
[104:08.64]This is weird rock formation.
[104:14.82]You look like someone hit random... in a creative character.
[104:19.39]Oh, that's a crock of absolute bullshit.
[104:26.15]That's- that's not even remotely accurate.
[104:38.00]Alright, there are many things that I am.
[104:40.44]But one thing I am not is you look like someone hit random on a character creator.

[107:41.17]The Jermaniacs.
[107:41.93]No, that's not what this... That's not what you guys are called.
[107:46.57]We have gone over this many times.
[107:47.97]You guys are the Jermamites.
[107:57.68]Anybody see water?
[108:03.12]No, not the rats.
[108:03.88]You are the Jermamites.
[108:05.40]The Jermamites.
[108:06.56]Yeah.
[108:06.68]You have to say it like that.
[108:08.38]Otherwise, it's not accurate.
[108:10.76]It's the accent there.
[108:16.92]No links, ResidentSleeper.
[108:18.70]Are you sure?
[108:19.64]I see a lot of them.
[108:21.42]Oh, here we go.
[108:22.04]What's down here?
[108:22.52]Oof.
[108:32.38]Martin, wait for the music.
[108:35.32]Martin, wait for the music.
[108:38.11]Martin, looking for the music.
[108:39.49]Martin, music.

[109:04.65]No.
[109:09.07]What?
[109:10.21]What?
[109:10.75]We made that reference before.
[109:12.19]I wasn't... That's the original image.
[109:15.87]Why are you linking the original image?
[109:17.47]Instant -2 for saying Rick?
[109:21.45]I wasn't even doing an impression.
[109:24.57]Instant.
[109:25.13]Instant.
[109:25.53]Just reaction when they... Rick and Morty, you downvote.
[109:29.97]I didn't do anything.
[109:30.79]Okay, I'm doing it again.
[109:31.95]I've said it again.
[109:32.99]I gotta stop saying the word.
[109:34.05]Alright.
[109:36.55]That show.
[109:37.67]What?
[109:38.01]What?
[109:38.35]Why are we so fucking crazy about that show?
[109:42.94]It's like, it's ear poison.
[109:45.00]If you hear that word.
[109:47.38]Why?
[109:48.32]It's alright.
[109:48.80]I mean, whatever.
[109:49.92]You guys don't care that much, do you?
[110:01.67]Yes, we do.
[110:03.55]What's your favorite TV show?
[110:06.51]What's your favorite TV show?
[110:08.74]Current TV show that's currently on the air.
[110:14.16]Fear Factor.
[110:15.06]That's not even on the air.
[110:19.84]The NBA.
[110:21.39]I mean, that's called the NBA school.
[110:24.99]Rojack Horseman.
[110:26.43]Okay.

[110:44.97]That's a great one.
[110:46.42]Here we go.
[110:47.62]We made it to the festival.
[110:49.60]How come I'm not... I am disgusted.
[110:52.66]I am absolutely revolted that I'm not seeing any Curb Your Enthusiasm fans here.
[110:56.58]I'm disgusted by this.
[110:57.78]I'm fucking actually disgusted.
[110:59.24]I think one person said it.
[111:14.71]Curb is for boomers.
[111:15.85]Oh, no.
[111:16.29]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[111:17.13]I'm revolted right now.
[111:18.39]I gotta go brush my teeth after hearing that.
[111:24.91]Okay, we need to find the person that listened to the music.
[111:32.79]He only likes to dance inside.
[111:39.34]Dancing inside.
[111:43.02]Where are you?
[111:44.36]Oh.
[111:45.60]Oh.
[111:47.92]Oh, I turned the music on.
[111:48.92]Alright, anybody dance?
[111:53.16]There's the only dances on the inside.
[111:55.06]How many more do I need to move?
[112:07.93]One more.
[112:08.73]And it's one of these hard ones.
[112:09.79]There's a reptile.
[112:13.26]He's a narcissist?
[112:14.10]What's this image?
[112:16.86]Narcissist.
[112:17.48]Narcissist.
[112:18.12]Narcissist.
[112:18.76]Narcissist.
[112:19.49]Narcissist.
[112:23.49]This one's good.
[112:24.57]I like this one.
[112:25.19]I'll show this one.
[112:27.19]This one's actually really... This one's pretty good.
[112:30.41]It is.
[112:36.00]Can you imagine walking into the bathroom and seeing this?
[112:51.85]Is it a public restroom?
[112:59.87]Album cover?
[113:02.76]He's an egomaniac.
[113:03.94]Alright, this reptile is in this cactus forest.
[113:08.02]It's so well camouflaged, it often loses itself.
[113:10.82]This extremely rare white-backed scorpion is surrounded by its children.
[113:14.23]A king of the desert never goes underground.
[113:19.43]Alright, king of the desert never goes underground.
[113:22.85]Well, I found the snake.
[113:25.13]How is that not the snake?
[113:32.67]Looking for a bunch of scorpions.
[113:36.40]There are no more people left.
[113:39.96]Scorpions.
[113:42.12]Tons of them.
[113:48.83]We want facecam.
[113:53.21]Oh, okay.
[114:00.10]Thanks for the feedback.
[114:00.80]Appreciate the feedback.
[114:08.43]Scammed out of a wink.
[114:10.72]What?
[114:12.56]Let me just make sure.
[114:13.94]Oh, fuck.
[114:14.52]Yeah, I did scam you.
[114:15.26]Hold on.
[114:15.52]Alright, I need either a snake or I need the scorpions.
[114:27.85]Or a bottle of water or a reptile in a cactus place.
[114:34.29]Bottle of water, cactus, forest.
[114:42.80]Cactus forest.
[114:43.96]Cactus forest.
[114:45.02]Cactus forest.
[114:47.20]No.
[114:49.73]What a handsome young man I am.
[114:51.45]Hey, thanks.
[114:57.69]Um, I don't even know what this is.
[115:01.42]What is this image?
[115:05.38]Is this like a bunch of dots?
[115:06.40]Like 3D mapping of me?
[115:08.82]I don't know what that is.
[115:09.54]I don't want to...
[115:15.20]Why does every one of your winks look like you're trying to get something out of your eye?
[115:17.80]Uh, because... I am trying to get something out of my eye.
[115:25.08]I'm trying to get a wink over with so I can go back to doing a livestream.
[115:27.96]Remember, those are codes.
[115:40.01]He hates us.
[115:42.20]No, I already told you how I feel about the Winx now, because, like, I thought it was funny for one day, and it's been two months.
[115:50.66]And I have to stay.
[115:51.46]I can't walk it back.
[115:56.48]I'm not gonna walk it back.
[115:57.58]I never said I was gonna walk it back.
[116:01.01]Increase the Winx price.
[116:02.07]No, no, no, I can't.
[116:03.61]It's too late.
[116:11.83]Come on, where are these scorpions?
[116:13.09]I need to find one more damn thing.
[116:25.70]Would you be mad if I made Winx 200,000?
[116:26.92]But... I kept 75,000.
[116:27.46]And 75,000 was... I...
[116:44.82]Fucking channel points.
[116:50.34]I say shpee.
[116:51.59]No, I don't want to do that.
[116:52.73]That's worse than winking.
[116:55.45]Imagine how often I would be doing that.
[116:58.25]You guys watch a lot and there's people that have a lot of points.
[117:00.85]I didn't even think about it.
[117:03.13]Oh, wait.
[117:06.03]I got it.
[117:12.12]Mom's waiting for the bus to the big city to buy some diapers.
[117:16.20]Yes, Mom.
[117:21.44]Okay.
[117:22.20]The TV technician is fine tuning a signal.
[117:27.54]TV... TV tech?
[117:33.52]TV tech?
[117:37.18]There you are.
[117:39.00]Move it out of the way, please.
[117:41.89]Where's my wink?
[117:46.47]Well, you know what I'm going to do?
[117:48.58]I know a 7,000 IQ play here.
[117:53.22]Soon, winks are going to be 75% off.
[117:58.35]For one day only.
[118:05.27]And then it's going away.
[118:16.23]Is he on B?
[118:29.00]I'll cover fire for you.
[118:32.46]I got a few hits on him.
[118:33.32]He's dead.
[118:34.60]One more.
[118:34.86]To the right.
[118:35.44]To the right.
[118:37.52]Yep.
[118:37.84]Got him.
[118:41.91]You're clear to go up.
[118:42.63]Go up.
[118:42.85]I got you.
[118:50.50]There's an old person's bone in some wall.
[118:52.70]Freaky stuff.
[118:53.46]Let's go.
[118:58.21]Winks are gonna crash?
[118:59.05]You need to sell them now.
[118:59.89]No, you don't.
[119:03.63]No, your wink... Don't you understand?
[119:05.31]Your winks are worth a lot now, and you're selling them.
[119:08.85]Because you know that winks are gonna be really, really inexpensive in like a month.
[119:19.33]That's insider wink trading.
[119:23.85]Oh man, why did I just fucking say that?
[119:25.93]Why did I say this?
[119:29.09]Oh man.
[119:29.75]Alright, what do we got?
[119:34.73]For mover buck, this job was one box too many.
[119:37.51]Looking for a moving company.
[119:47.75]Moving company right here.
[119:48.94]Follow him.
[119:53.20]What happened up here?
[119:54.46]Whoa!
[119:55.56]Whoa!
[119:56.96]Why?
[119:57.86]What?
[119:58.66]What's going on up here?
[120:02.30]What happened?
[120:03.24]Why is it all red?
[120:03.84]I didn't... Fucking zit development going on up there.
[120:14.87]I hate that.
[120:15.43]Don't you hate it when you know you just got zit development?
[120:18.73]There's a whole block on the street forehead.
[120:22.71]And you just know, and here it comes.
[120:26.85]And there's four or five zits moving in.
[120:29.77]It's the worst.
[120:30.24]Alright, where's this moving company?
[120:42.84]What's the other ones?
[120:44.20]Swimmer Sven got the address right, but the pool wrong.
[120:48.58]Peter Griffin.
[120:58.87]Fucking dumb stuff.
[121:03.89]Oh, Lois.
[121:04.91]No, I don't.
[121:05.79]That's another one.
[121:07.21]That instantly is just like, he said Family Guy word.
[121:09.61]Now I have to do, I hate him.
[121:28.34]What about the other ones?
[121:30.36]Maybe a bunch of sugar cubes and 20 lollipops wasn't the right recipe for lemonade, Lemo.
[121:37.97]Charlie's yard sale is a big success, but where is the salesman himself?
[121:41.45]There's the lemonade.
[121:52.88]Lemo.
[121:58.84]My favorite voice so far.
[122:07.35]That's every Casio keyboard that has the weird human voice.
[122:10.37]Every time you went into the stores that just had the keyboards and you just put it on the voice one and just start pressing buttons.
[122:16.57]And then you look at it and go, this is $700.
[122:19.65]Okay, bye.
[122:32.88]Who's this in the... Alright, where's this one?
[122:35.24]Mover Buck.
[122:35.94]Alright, this is the moving truck right here.
[122:42.96]I'm gonna follow it.
[122:48.47]It's the yard sale.
[122:50.19]Remember this.
[122:58.09]TV?
[123:00.21]No, it didn't even go anywhere.
[123:01.21]What the fuck?
[123:03.95]What else is there?
[123:04.39]Who's this?
[123:05.62]Ito is halfway to hearing his fortune.
[123:09.68]Driver Dave is being tailgated by some crazy truck driver.
[123:12.54]Sullivan wants to dance, so he's waiting for the music to kick in.
[123:16.43]His link time is over.
[123:31.90]Alright, uh, this is just what happens.
[123:35.33]This is the fate.
[123:36.11]This is in all the movies that have this in it.
[123:40.67]This is, uh... Alright, this is what happens after seven days in all the Ring movies to the people.
[124:12.90]They spin the chair around and that's what it looks like.
[124:15.30]Oh no, he watched the tape seven days ago.
[124:17.48]Hey!
[124:18.02]Who are you?
[124:28.47]Alright, I need movers.
[124:34.17]Movers, you gotta pay attention.
[124:37.69]One box too many.
[124:40.79]And, this kayaker got home from a long kayaking trip.
[124:43.86]He just wants to watch TV now.
[124:45.02]But, oh, no signal.
[124:53.64]Movers.
[124:55.12]One box too many.
[125:00.26]There he is.
[125:01.84]Got you.
[125:03.56]Got you.
[125:05.84]Swimmer Sven got the address right, but the pool wrong.
[125:12.02]He's going to be in a fountain.
[125:17.95]Looking for this guy in a fountain.
[125:19.49]It's definitely, there's a pool party.
[125:22.23]Spend.
[125:30.79]Redeemed a wink, redeemed a wink.
[125:32.08]I can see that your text is like purple.
[125:34.76]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[125:36.14]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[125:42.42]Found Bobby!
[125:43.58]Bling!
[125:46.16]You owe five links.
[125:47.91]No, I don't.
[125:50.26]Oh, shit.
[125:50.76]I owe, like, three.
[126:17.95]Why do I look like that?
[126:38.10]Your cheeks are red.
[126:38.94]Did someone punch you?
[126:40.66]No, I'm just... I'm in a... I'm a little flush.
[126:43.48]Wait, I'm not allowed to be flush in my own house?
[126:51.53]Alright, where's the swimmer?
[127:08.08]Change the channel points to make it so you have to say a dumb pee-pee poo-poo joke.
[127:13.62]No.
[127:14.82]I'm sorry, that's not gonna happen.
[127:16.96]Alright, pool.
[127:17.68]Pool.
[127:17.82]Pool.
[127:21.50]Okay, there it is.
[127:22.08]Is that him?
[127:26.35]Pick up skull.
[127:26.95]Please pick up the skull and put skull down in Diablo.
[127:28.73]Please.
[127:30.23]Oh, yes.
[127:30.67]Okay.
[127:43.95]Where's this pole?
[127:48.50]Ah.
[127:49.84]Ah.
[127:52.24]Can you make that sound?
[127:59.93]Nope.
[128:00.13]Some people can.
[128:00.59]I can't.
[128:11.83]If you want to know how to do that, you go like this.
[128:25.42]Why are your cheeks red?
[128:26.68]Are you alright?
[128:27.52]What happened to you?
[128:28.76]Why do you look like that?
[128:30.40]Tell me what's going on.
[128:31.64]What happened?
[128:34.09]Ma, I was trying to do the fucking water drop sound.
[128:37.03]Okay.
[128:47.07]I always know where your saw is hanging out when you're renovating.
[128:50.22]That one's boring.
[128:56.28]Charlie's yard sale is a big success, but where's Charlie?
[129:00.52]The yard sale is over here somewhere.
[129:02.25]Right here.
[129:04.19]Where are you, Charlie?
[129:08.83]Where are you, Charlie?
[129:12.77]There's lots of money in here, Charlie.
[129:16.94]Charlie, where's Charlie?
[129:28.34]Where's Charlie?
[129:36.08]Where's Charlie?
[129:38.85]Okay, got a rock but where's Charlie?
[129:45.90]Mmm, Charlie.
[129:48.94]I'm pissing somebody off so fucking much by saying this.
[129:52.23]I'm, like, just hitting somebody's, like, a trigger point in their brain where they're just like, fuck up.
[129:59.49]Ugh, I hate it.
[130:00.17]Where is this guy, though?
[130:08.94]Seriously.
[130:15.78]Glasses wait don't any glasses What
[130:45.59]Something going on in this house that I need to do.
[130:47.35]Definitely.
[130:50.87]The signal's bad, right?
[130:52.05]He wants to watch TV?
[130:52.81]Got to stop.
[131:03.46]Yeah, it says like, oh, he wants to watch TV, but the signal is bad.
[131:05.82]Being tailgated.
[131:08.14]See, he probably wanted to buy the no signal for the TV.
[131:18.58]I'd like to play a game.
[131:20.80]Somebody said pre-game, by the way.
[131:26.67]It's probably been two and a half hours.
[131:30.11]Oh, shit.
[131:30.91]Whoops.
[131:31.17]Oh.
[131:47.24]I like the sounds.
[131:55.01]Who else can we look for?
[131:55.79]What do I need?
[131:56.25]Five more.
[131:56.89]Alright.
[131:59.17]Vito is halfway to hearing his fortune, whatever that means.
[132:02.12]This plant wants to use radio waves to communicate.
[132:04.48]Okay.
[132:06.70]Squirrel uses its cuteness to persuade passersby to give it fresh food.
[132:12.16]Passersby.
[132:12.82]It's gotta be somewhere over here.
[132:23.03]Squirrel.
[132:24.25]Where's the squirrel that was in the food?
[132:30.59]Got ya.
[132:31.25]There, I told you.
[132:31.99]You guys were like, what are you talking about?
[132:33.17]I need a squirrel.
[132:39.81]If I was a squirrel...
[132:42.45]Where would I be?
[132:44.25]In a tree?
[132:50.48]Near a bird?
[132:51.54]In a bird's nest?
[132:56.58]No?
[132:59.40]Alright, what's going on in here?
[133:05.08]Gaia!
[133:05.48]Oh my god, that's Jolly!
[133:09.79]Grandma, I don't know.
[133:10.41]I'm just asking out loud.
[133:13.65]Alright, three more.
[133:14.25]One, it's only the squirrel.
[133:18.27]Who are you?
[133:19.70]Grandma loves the sound of electricity so much.
[133:23.56]Alright, we got a 5G brain here.
[133:27.84]Elif can't stand that ugly statue her husband put in their garden.
[133:34.18]Didn't I see that over here?
[133:34.96]There's a big-ass statue over here somewhere.
[133:37.82]Where is it?
[133:40.94]You know what I'm talking about, right?
[133:41.80]It was like over here?
[133:42.50]There it is.
[133:48.00]Got it.
[133:52.24]Two more.
[133:57.96]Squirrel.
[134:00.42]There's also mail, too.
[134:01.74]Some say that opening ghost mail will curse you for a thousand years.
[134:05.86]What?
[134:09.42]It'll also land you a thousand days in prison, because it's a federal offense.
[134:14.51]It's a squirrel.
[134:22.67]Nothing?
[134:30.37]You know why I'm laughing, but I can't say it.
[134:33.16]I cannot tell you why I just laughed.
[134:36.91]That's one of the forbidden things, phrases.
[134:39.40]Driver Dave.
[134:45.64]Alright, Driver Dave is being tailgated by somebody.
[134:48.54]Where?
[134:49.64]Right here, right?
[134:50.37]Dave?
[134:52.21]Is that you?
[134:52.59]This guy's pretty close.
[134:54.55]Right there.
[135:12.00]Alright, we just need to find the ghost mail, or... Mysterious pyramid-shaped object still needs to be delivered.
[135:17.54]Fortune teller Terry is still a few blocks away.
[135:19.86]Hmm.
[135:25.28]Or... Sullivan wants to dance.
[135:28.69]He's waiting for the music to kick in.
[135:30.27]Didn't I turn on music over here somewhere?
[135:33.07]I did.
[135:33.41]Oh, ghost mail.
[135:35.57]I win.
[135:37.16]Stay here for a second, though, because there's... I turned on a stereo.
[135:41.40]Didn't I?
[135:41.62]Yeah, it's right here.
[135:45.96]Got it.
[135:47.48]What's next?
[136:02.91]Why are you still playing this?
[136:04.11]I don't know.
[136:06.18]But did I seriously just shut off the Citadel reactor with my toe?
[136:09.58]I'm going to be so... What?
[136:10.52]What the fuck is this?
[136:13.36]Alright, last level.
[136:23.23]Last level and then we'll do something else.
[136:26.53]Last level, and then we'll do something else.
[136:28.94]It can't be Mega Man Legends.
[136:30.00]It can't.
[136:30.30]I'm sorry.
[136:31.36]It's too late.
[136:32.44]I took too long.
[136:45.84]Buy the first one?
[136:46.68]I don't, uh... Yeah, I don't have the first one, that's true.
[136:49.38]Yeah, fuck.
[136:50.32]Fuck, you're right.
[136:51.00]I can't play Mega Man Legends, because... God damn it, I only have the second one.
[136:55.24]Fucking idiot.
[136:55.81]I'm so stupid.
[136:56.57]Why would I do that?
[136:57.97]That's alright, we can do it next time.
[136:58.95]We'll do it later.
[137:00.51]That's a good point.
[137:04.85]Fuck.
[137:05.29]I'm so stupid sometimes.
[137:07.83]What an idiot.
[137:09.21]Alright.
[137:10.45]A real businessman stays up to date, folks.
[137:16.29]The bad day for this beggar, people have stopped using her metro entrance.
[137:19.92]Okay.
[137:22.68]There it is right here.
[137:25.24]I mean, the people clearly look like they're using this entrance.
[137:27.62]Maybe there's another one.
[137:31.06]Metro, there it is.
[137:31.88]Okay, I'm going to sneeze.
[137:38.71]I just want to give you a large, at least probably 60 second warning.
[137:42.45]It's going to happen.
[137:47.36]Any second, it's gonna happen.
[137:53.46]Is that a businessman?
[137:55.16]Businessman, businessman, businessman.
[137:57.76]Businessman, staying up to date.
[137:59.16]Businessman.
[137:59.76]We're handing out papers.
[138:12.66]Businessman.
[138:15.03]Right here somewhere.
[138:17.25]This, I mean, this person is just standing up there.
[138:19.95]Alright, well, businessman.
[138:22.89]Staying up to date.
[138:32.43]Businessman?
[138:32.81]Shit, no.
[138:32.99]What are you doing up there?
[138:48.17]Who are you?
[138:49.07]No, you can't get away.
[138:52.81]I... With the glasses.
[138:53.71]What was that?
[139:25.30]Got it.
[139:25.52]Okay.
[139:26.82]How many more do I need?
[139:28.12]Two more.
[139:28.58]And then we'll move on to something else.
[139:31.69]But what are we going to do, though?
[139:33.05]What are we going to do?
[139:35.65]Hmm.
[139:37.85]This is tricky.
[139:38.37]I don't know.
[139:38.69]There's a few options.
[139:46.72]Giorgio is leaving.
[139:48.02]No, he isn't.
[139:48.54]Yes, he is.
[139:49.06]No, he isn't.
[139:49.50]Yes, he is.
[139:49.96]No, he isn't.
[139:53.87]There was a guy getting out of the train, off the train, out of a bus, off the bus.
[139:56.75]Something like that.
[140:07.03]Who talked to Transformer.
[140:12.37]We'll see.
[140:12.67]I don't know.
[140:13.99]I'm not going to play fucking Doki Doki Literature Club.
[140:17.35]That's never going to happen, guys.
[140:19.39]The only way that happens is if I lose a stupid bet like this.
[140:23.01]If I don't find the toolbox in the next 30 minutes, I will play Doki Doki Literature Club for at least 30 minutes.
[140:30.66]Okay, good.
[140:31.24]Go.
[140:34.50]Toolbox is so happy the builders couldn't carry it up.
[140:49.10]Someone left their sexy sacks in the cargo hold.
[140:54.04]It's trash.
[141:04.58]Why would I want to get trash?
[141:05.42]Alright.
[141:06.06]Johnny forgot his stuff at the bus stop, but no worries, he's got a round trip ticket and he's on his way back.
[141:13.07]Alright.
[141:14.41]Here he comes.
[141:15.39]Off the bus stop?
[141:17.81]I think that's probably his stop.
[141:19.95]Wait for him.
[141:20.43]How about Drew Crew?
[141:24.78]No, I'm not feeling Drew Crew right now.
[141:29.32]Replace Wink with Open Doki Doki Literature Club and close it.
[141:40.78]No.
[141:42.38]That's just a waste of bandwidth.
[141:45.56]That means I have to go spend the data and the bandwidth in the internet tubes to download that game, open it, and then close it, and then uninstall it.
[141:54.70]That's just a waste of internet.
[141:58.90]Is this guy gonna come back and get his shit or what?
[142:07.33]This is very clearly just stuff he left at the bus stop.
[142:12.32]Where did you get this game?
[142:13.46]It's on Steam.
[142:14.90]It's called Hidden Folks.
[142:19.42]Where is this person?
[142:24.05]Got that?
[142:24.61]Found Giorgio.
[142:25.89]Stay here.
[142:28.01]He's going to get off the bus.
[142:30.39]Is this stuff over here?
[142:31.53]Let's get a big view.
[142:40.22]Play a game, please.
[142:44.24]What is... What is the... What am I doing right now?
[142:46.38]Is this... This is not a game?
[142:47.36]Dude, come on.
[142:53.34]Like, when are you gonna play a game?
[142:54.36]How is this not a game?
[142:59.62]Playing tag with your friends is a game.
[143:03.31]Doing, like, a Sudoku in the newspaper is a game.
[143:15.15]Play tag on stream.
[143:18.07]No.
[143:19.23]Where is this guy to get his stuff?
[143:20.90]Alright, fucking give me a... This is a children's book.
[143:29.64]This is a video game that I purchased on Steam, the platform that sells video games.
[143:40.80]Jump King DLC, or Chat Makes Fun of You.
[143:43.22]I'm all for that.
[143:45.70]No, I don't have it in me to do that right now.
[143:49.70]Visual novels?
[143:50.54]Yeah, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[143:52.32]I'm about to throw this right back at you here.
[143:55.82]This is not a game.
[143:57.99]But a visual novel is.
[144:03.97]Can we explain that to me for a second?
[144:09.50]Yes.
[144:10.44]So reading pictures on a screen with text is a video game, but this is not.
[144:21.89]I think you guys seriously need to reevaluate what a video game is to you guys.
[144:26.95]Look up the definition of a game.
[144:28.24]I could make up a game right now.
[144:32.18]First person that says won out loud wins the game.
[144:34.78]Won.
[144:35.34]I won.
[144:35.88]My game that I just made up.
[144:36.88]That was a fun game.
[144:40.11]I actually didn't, you guys did.
[144:41.29]Somebody said it before me.
[144:45.32]Alright, what are we doing?
[144:46.90]I'm done with this game.
[144:47.72]It was fun.
[144:48.76]I'm done with this game.
[144:49.52]I'm done with this game.
[144:50.98]That was a good game.
[144:54.32]I got on my floor of video games.
[145:05.92]He lost his own game.
[145:15.36]Resident Evil 2 remake Claire B. I don't even have that installed.
[145:24.05]I got the toolbox.
[145:24.79]Look, I'll prove it.
[145:25.43]There it is.
[145:36.45]Remember a lot about Mega Man Legends.
[145:38.27]Yeah, here's the thing about Mega Man Legends.
[145:40.09]I got my anniversaries tonight.
[145:41.79]And I can't be late.
[145:43.71]So, starting Mega Man Legends right now would be not very good because I would probably stay here.
[145:49.51]And Kim and I have reservations.
[145:53.29]And if I'm like, yeah, let me just keep playing Mega Man Legends because I'm going to do that in one stream.
[145:56.91]The game's only like six or seven hours long.
[146:00.27]So, get the fuck out of here.
[146:02.21]No, no, not yet.
[146:03.53]This is tonight.
[146:04.69]This is a little bit later.
[146:09.95]Is that a circus restaurant?
[146:12.09]Alright.
[146:12.45]Let me see what we got here.
[146:15.67]I'm taking her to Chuck E. Cheese.
[146:19.39]No, that's too fancy for me.
[146:41.26]That's too fancy for me.
[146:42.30]Alright, what have I got?
[146:43.24]What have I got on Steam?
[146:45.77]Either that or I'm going to put in... You know what?
[146:50.03]Eh, you know what?
[146:50.95]Eh, you know what?
[146:52.17]It's alright.
[146:52.77]Alright, if I start Mega Man Legends right now, I'm not going to be able to finish it.
[146:57.27]You know what I'm saying?
[146:58.74]It's supposed to be its own thing.
[147:05.26]And then I'll have to put this in somewhere...
[147:08.98]No, I'm only going to be able to play this for like two or three hours.
[147:12.58]Pops.
[147:20.04]It's a shitty game.
[147:20.90]What?
[147:21.94]Alright, let's do Talk to Transformer.
[147:23.29]Let's just hang out.
[147:25.37]Let's hang out.
[147:28.33]Maybe we'll do a couple of tier lists too.
[147:29.83]Might as well.
[147:30.79]Alright, let me get out of here.
[147:34.71]This was fun.
[147:36.07]I liked this.
[147:38.38]I enjoyed that.
[147:39.08]Alright, let's get...
