[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.60]Hey, what's up?
[00:06.96]What's going on?
[00:09.84]We said that the sponsors were still in the description.
[00:14.44]Yeah, well, whatever.
[00:15.48]That's fine.
[00:16.93]I fixed it.
[00:19.03]It's alright.
[00:25.79]Stop.
[00:26.49]What?
[00:28.23]It's a free ad.
[00:31.31]No, I mean, look.
[00:34.10]Hey, they supported that show.
[00:36.62]Okay.
[00:37.92]I'm fine with that.
[00:38.56]I don't care.
[00:43.94]You got a mustache?
[00:46.02]Uh.
[00:48.30]What do you think?
[00:49.62]Do you think it's still there?
[00:52.42]What do you think?
[00:53.14]Should we do another vote?
[00:59.92]Hmm.
[01:06.45]We could.
[01:11.26]Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to bet on this, you absolutely can.
[01:15.30]I just want to let you know that I have... This is on you.
[01:18.64]If you bet and you lose and you lose all your channel points, that's not on me that you decided to do that.
[01:25.57]I would not bet on this.
[01:26.83]This could be anything.
[01:29.53]This is actually just flipping a coin in the air.
[01:31.39]You have no idea.
[01:35.43]Just do a regular fall.
[01:36.21]Don't need to do it bad.
[01:40.51]Well, there it is.
[01:41.17]Alright, is it there?
[01:43.71]Oh, okay.
[01:48.45]I have nothing to do with this.
[01:49.55]I'm just saying, if you get mad at me after this, if I open up the chat over here and I look over and I'm like, dude, what the fuck?
[01:56.25]Like, you fucking scammed me out of my point.
[01:59.04]No, I didn't do anything.
[02:01.10]I'm not telling you to do this.
[02:11.72]Somebody said this is easy points.
[02:14.02]How would you know?
[02:18.38]You wouldn't really know that it was easy because you don't know if it's there.
[02:32.27]Are you Kappa-ing right now?
[02:35.33]I'm not going to tell you anything because the poll is still up.
[02:38.85]So I'm not going to say anything to you.
[02:53.85]Can we get some more gif emotes as sub emotes?
[02:58.53]I'm the worst streamer on Twitch.
[03:00.87]In regards to this kind of stuff.
[03:03.37]I just, I don't know.
[03:05.75]Emotes and new things.
[03:07.25]There hasn't been a new sub emote.
[03:10.67]I think I have like a hundred slots.
[03:13.41]And like 24 of them are taken up right now.
[03:16.65]Maybe.
[03:18.75]I just, I don't know.
[03:19.69]I...
[03:26.39]But what would they even be?
[03:27.35]You know, okay, here's the thing about emotes and emote slots.
[03:30.56]I don't know if I had this opinion years ago.
[03:36.34]Leather jacket.
[03:36.96]I fucking clicked on the button to start a prediction and it blue screened my computer.
[03:40.32]Okay, well, wait, is it over?
[03:44.46]Alright, hold on.
[03:46.80]Hold that thought.
[03:47.72]Hold that thought.
[03:49.82]Is it still there?
[03:53.01]Alright, is the voting closed?
[04:01.00]okay here we go you guys ready oh is it still there oh god is it still there no it's gone sorry everybody if you voted that is there it's not there anymore
[04:29.37]It was so gross.
[04:30.57]I had to get rid of it.
[04:31.17]I'm sorry.
[04:31.54]It was causing me physical pain.
[04:37.02]I know people said, dude, you have to trim it.
[04:39.00]I'm not a facial hair person.
[04:43.35]I'm not.
[04:49.25]It looked good.
[04:50.41]No, it looked good on a fucking webcam through the internet, which you guys don't understand.
[04:56.54]I have to make this very clear to anybody watching this stream.
[05:02.70]The amount of pixels that exist on any type of webcam or camera or anything, even just this right here.
[05:08.72]You're not seeing a clear picture of my face.
[05:12.06]You're seeing a kind of clear picture.
[05:14.11]It's good enough.
[05:15.01]It's 480p or 720 or something that's scaled down or scaled up.
[05:18.73]But the issue is, you don't really, this blends together a lot.
[05:23.23]For instance, huge zit.
[05:24.79]You probably didn't even notice.
[05:26.49]Maybe you did notice that.
[05:27.59]But let me tell you something in real life.
[05:29.28]Like if I go in the mirror and I lean in,
[05:31.62]It's ghastly.
[05:33.28]It's ghastly.
[05:33.96]But you just can't see that.
[05:35.56]You can kind of tell that there's something there.
[05:38.59]But when I had that mustache, when it's blurring and blending together from the webcam, it looks fine.
[05:45.15]But when I lean in and I'm looking in the mirror and I got a light on, I look like a scarecrow.
[05:51.37]I look like the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.
[05:54.04]It's just like these spines that they just point in random directions that looks bad.
[06:03.98]I mean, it's ghastly.
[06:04.80]It is.
[06:06.42]Dude, you look normal.
[06:08.36]Yeah, I don't... You didn't even do a full shave.
[06:17.84]It's still there.
[06:18.62]Yes, I... Yeah, but it... Dude, okay.
[06:21.44]It's been... When was the last time I streamed?
[06:27.08]Three days ago?
[06:27.66]Two days ago?
[06:35.15]You look like you got smoothed out by a clothing iron.
[06:45.35]That's a really specific compliment and insult together.
[06:54.44]I know exactly what you mean, and that's funny.
[06:58.08]But anyways.
[06:59.95]Yeah, okay, so when I shaved two days ago, three days ago, this is what just happens when it grows back.
[07:07.13]Smoothed out by a clothing iron.
[07:10.39]Tiny facecam.
[07:11.47]It's not tiny.
[07:12.19]It's a perfectly normal size.
[07:13.91]Alright, so here's the deal.
[07:15.78]Here's what's going on.
[07:16.42]Let me explain a few things.
[07:20.09]You're a greaseball.
[07:22.13]My hair is wet.
[07:22.87]I took a shower and it's going to dry in an hour and you're going to be like, well, why does the hair look like, why does hair look like shit today?
[07:29.47]It's because it's just wet and then it just dries.
[07:31.41]I didn't put any product in my hair.
[07:38.28]I'm going to turn this way and it's going to be like this big poof and people are going to screenshot, like zoom in right there.
[07:43.72]See, his hairline is going back.
[07:44.92]Do you see?
[07:46.96]Yeah, it is.
[07:47.94]Good.
[07:49.18]Good.
[07:49.50]I can't wait to be ugly.
[07:50.88]Can I tell you?
[07:51.78]I can't wait till I'm a gross old man just sitting there like, like skin sagging down like to here.
[07:58.64]I can't wait till I'm fucking gross and old.
[08:03.93]Because I'll tell you, well, let me, when you cross like 30, like 35,
[08:11.89]Yeah, you kind of don't really care that much about, oh my, I tell you, when I turned 30, on my 30th birthday, I noticed that I had some thinning hair.
[08:24.86]I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[08:26.70]It can't be.
[08:27.50]No, not yet.
[08:28.30]I'm 30.
[08:29.34]No, no, no.
[08:30.46]Maybe if I can individually give each one of these vitamins.
[08:33.20]Dude, I would put olive oil in my hair.
[08:35.28]Olive oil and tea tree oil.
[08:36.74]I would do like this slurry and I would put it all in my head.
[08:39.64]I would put olive oil all over my head.
[08:41.84]Back when I was 30, 31.
[08:42.56]I was terrified of losing my hair.
[08:44.88]I was like, no, I can't.
[08:45.88]I can't.
[08:46.17]It can't go.
[08:48.51]So I just, you know, read all these concoctions.
[08:51.27]And oh, you know, like tea tree oil stimulates hair growth.
[08:55.16]I started drinking a lot of, you know, a lot more water, a lot of green tea.
[09:00.60]And I mean, at some point I kind of just gave up on that.
[09:03.91]I didn't really care anymore.
[09:08.49]So after like thirty five.
[09:13.29]I'll tell you, if you're concerned about kind of your hair, if you're a guy and you're concerned about hair loss, you go from this mode of, oh, this can't be happening to me at some point in your 20s or your late 20s, early 30s, whatever it is, whenever it starts to thin.
[09:30.85]And then you kind of just go, you know what?
[09:32.03]People age.
[09:32.71]Who cares?
[09:35.01]People age.
[09:35.79]That's what happens when you turn 30, 40, 50.
[09:37.45]You age.
[09:39.03]Who cares?
[09:39.41]That's fine.
[09:42.03]I don't have a problem with it anymore.
[09:47.59]How come you do the lamest shit when you get back from an event?
[09:49.87]You mean like Pac-Man?
[09:52.04]What are you talking about?
[09:56.38]Pac-Man World is lame?
[09:59.06]I mean, I guess that's your, you know...
[10:06.33]This is my first.
[10:07.65]What?
[10:08.19]You don't like Pac-Man world?
[10:10.36]Well, I'll tell you, chatter.
[10:13.32]This was voted on before the stream started.
[10:16.80]This was voted on by a bunch of your peers.
[10:24.31]So you got other people to be upset with.
[10:36.79]Your classmates, yeah.
[10:40.09]Did the olive oil... What did you say?
[10:45.08]Dude, do baseball.
[10:45.96]It's way cooler.
[10:46.72]Dude, let's just do another baseball stream.
[10:52.42]I actually, like, want to so bad.
[10:55.92]I so badly want to do that again.
[10:57.40]But, you know, whatever.
[10:58.50]You move on.
[10:59.01]The next one.
[11:01.48]But anyways, we're going to play Pac-Man World.
[11:03.14]What was I just talking about?
[11:05.54]It was something I was going to bring up, and I don't remember what it was.
[11:08.74]What the hell were we just talking about?
[11:14.89]No, before hair.
[11:15.87]Before the hair loss thing.
[11:18.89]It was after mustache and before hair.
[11:30.87]Being old.
[11:31.45]No, that was part of the hair.
[11:32.49]Sorry, whatever.
[11:33.01]Alright, I got a controller here.
[11:36.07]This is Pac-Man World Breaks.
[11:37.23]Oops.
[11:39.49]Being old.
[11:40.39]Showering.
[11:41.61]I don't remember.
[11:42.13]Who cares?
[11:42.49]It doesn't really matter at this point.
[11:46.97]Camera.
[11:47.37]Yeah, we're going to play Cult of the Lamb.
[11:51.30]That was on the poll.
[11:52.08]I'm telling you.
[11:53.54]You had a... This is very... Why is this so loud?
[11:59.06]Cult of the Lamb and Sorcery Part 3 are going to be this week as well as something else that I will be participating in.
[12:08.21]I don't want to announce it before somebody else does.
[12:14.98]Maybe let me ask.
[12:15.66]Let me see if I can just announce it.
[12:18.00]Maybe I shouldn't.
[12:42.62]Oh, fuck, I already said it, didn't I?
[12:43.92]I already did say it.
[12:47.56]That's right, I said it in the pre-stream chat.
[12:50.54]Oh.
[12:50.70]Oh, whatever.
[12:56.17]If I get confirmation, I'll formally announce it.
[13:00.59]Leak Andy.
[13:01.41]No, not Leak Andy.
[13:02.55]Alright, I'm ready.
[13:07.86]We're gonna play Pac-Man World, the lamest thing I've done since baseball.
[13:12.16]So let's go ahead and go.
[13:18.09]Start with English.
[13:18.85]Okay, yes.
[13:20.75]I have to be really honest.
[13:24.37]I've put up this facade for a very long time, and I'm coming to terms with it right now.
[13:30.65]I don't care about Pac-Man at all.
[13:33.93]Like, oh, here we go!
[13:34.67]Pac-Man world, everyone, let's go!
[13:36.33]Oh, the Pac-Man music!
[13:37.81]I kind of don't care.
[13:40.72]Like, I'm sitting here going, oh man, let's get hyped for Pac-Man!
[13:43.50]It's a Pac-Man party!
[13:45.91]I mean, I think Pac-Man's cool, but do I think he's this cool?
[13:49.07]I don't think so.
[13:50.53]Alright, let's turn it up.
[13:51.93]Cutscene.
[13:54.43]I mean, he's cool.
[13:56.23]Have I been pretending to... I have to play every Pac-Man game that comes out?
[14:06.02]Pac-Man made you.
[14:07.38]Now that's fair.
[14:16.14]Who is this?
[14:23.34]Who is Hawkman?
[14:24.90]Hawkman's naked?
[14:37.21]He doesn't have like SpongeBob pants on?
[14:40.14]Why is that weird for me to look at right now?
[14:41.56]Isn't that weird?
[14:42.14]Something's weird about this.
[14:43.02]What is it?
[14:44.46]Why is it so different?
[14:46.91]Pack Mom?
[14:47.41]Doesn't he have pants on in Smash Brothers?
[15:03.70]Hold on.
[15:18.94]Whoa, this is actually 3D!
[15:20.30]Oh, God, this is 3D!
[15:21.06]Alright, hold on.
[15:23.24]Probably just got cut off.
[15:24.28]Wait, hold on.
[15:24.72]What does he look like in Smash Bros.?
[15:29.42]Pac-Man Smash Bros.
[15:37.29]Yeah, he does have... Yeah, that's right.
[15:39.31]I guess I'm just... I just don't remember.
[15:42.17]I don't know why this is so weird for me to look at right now.
[15:50.10]Okay, I'm back.
[15:52.08]Alright, welcome to Pac-Man World.
[15:53.86]Over there is the ghost area.
[15:55.80]Watch out for ghosts and eat all the Pac-Dots.
[15:59.16]The big dots are power pellets.
[16:00.34]Eat them to power up Pac-Man and get the ghosts.
[16:04.28]Don't get careless.
[16:05.08]Power pellet effects wear off after a while.
[16:06.94]Yeah, I've played... Fake fan?
[16:14.15]Alright.
[16:16.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[16:17.49]This is actually pretty sick.
[16:23.22]Wait, you can break stuff?
[16:24.48]What is B?
[16:25.22]How long does this last?
[16:27.76]Alright, cool.
[16:28.40]Very cool.
[16:28.74]Oh, Pat coins.
[16:29.31]This is a slot.
[16:30.39]Metal hang onto it and you'll be glad you did later.
[16:52.11]Wait, you can throw shit?
[16:55.74]Wait, you can throw grenades.
[16:56.82]Alright, cool.
[17:00.36]What do I have to do?
[17:01.34]Be careful, Pac-Man.
[17:02.90]There are a lot of enemies up ahead.
[17:04.70]Try taking them out with the Plot Dots.
[17:07.78]Okay.
[17:08.00]If you have any Pac-Dots, you can press B to perform a Pac-Dot attack.
[17:11.86]If you have lots of dots, hold to charge a bomb attack.
[17:18.42]Is there a lock on?
[17:19.02]Alright, that's pretty fun.
[17:21.48]How do you open chests?
[17:27.25]What was that?
[17:31.75]Wait, this is like a Yoshi thing.
[17:34.75]Go back, go back, go back.
[17:35.85]Oh, did I miss something?
[17:36.81]I mean, I'm 100%ing the game, so I feel you.
[17:41.37]What did I miss?
[17:48.31]Did I miss something?
[17:48.87]Somebody said, Dollar General Andy.
[17:53.73]What does that mean?
[17:57.65]There's bananas up the... Oh, there are bananas in the trees.
[17:59.79]You're right.
[18:04.28]Cool.
[18:04.68]Alright, let's go.
[18:08.52]Oh, that's how you... Alright, so that's what I'm missing.
[18:12.84]Cool.
[18:13.88]Oh my god, it's been so... I've been waiting for this game for like 10 years.
[18:19.17]I'm gonna really cherish it.
[18:21.61]I press A to float to the surface.
[18:23.17]Ooh, alright.
[18:30.88]How do I get down there?
[18:31.72]Oh, you can just float.
[18:39.56]So if you're not sure, if you're not a big Pac-Man fan, that's fine.
[18:44.34]This is a remake of an old game for, I believe, PlayStation.
[18:48.74]Pac-Man World, I believe, was 1998.
[18:54.49]Scream already.
[18:55.29]I've screamed twice in 10 minutes of the stream starting.
[18:57.79]Alright, ban that guy for as long as it takes for them to understand what they did wrong.
[19:04.80]Which is probably two minutes.
[19:08.58]Okay, press them with a butt bounce.
[19:09.87]The green switch only works one time.
[19:14.77]What does it do?
[19:17.71]Oh, alright.
[19:18.63]This is cute.
[19:19.39]What's wrong with this?
[19:20.21]This is cute.
[19:22.57]This is a cute game.
[19:25.21]This is way better than Glover.
[19:27.15]I'll tell you, factually.
[19:29.56]Matter of absolute fact, this is way better than Glover.
[19:32.64]A hundred times better.
[19:35.56]And I love Glover.
[19:37.64]Glover's like one of my favorite N64 games.
[19:39.08]Okay, when the switch's effect wears off, does this one only last a certain amount of time?
[19:50.92]Just testing.
[19:52.58]That's a trampoline.
[19:53.70]Aim at the center with a butt bounce and bounce into the air.
[19:59.33]But not before I go get the secrets.
[20:00.61]Okay.
[20:02.07]Okay.
[20:06.26]Cool.
[20:07.70]Alright, how do I get... Oh, I can do a Sonic the Hedgehog bounce.
[20:13.76]Cool.
[20:14.34]Is this game hard or is this for actual kids?
[20:19.28]Jump at the water's surface to do a dolphin jump.
[20:22.86]Use it to get items above the water.
[20:24.14]Yep.
[20:24.80]Butt bouncing.
[20:26.33]Treasure chest in the water.
[20:27.65]Needs something to do that though.
[20:28.89]Alright, that's fine.
[20:32.39]What's in here?
[20:35.49]metal dot from the treasure chest metal dots allow you to walk underwater while you're metallic you're invulnerable what's that what's the goal what's the actual goal of this game is it like banjo kazooie is it kind of like do I have to collect stuff
[21:00.99]I think I'm gonna beat this game.
[21:02.75]Like, in the next three hours.
[21:04.21]I think I'm going for it.
[21:07.15]Okay, you've reached checkpoint.
[21:08.89]Yep, start over.
[21:09.83]Have you tried the rev roll?
[21:12.27]Hold Y and let go.
[21:14.29]You can climb steep hills by using a rev roll.
[21:19.95]Really?
[21:20.23]Don't.
[21:25.65]I'm gonna.
[21:25.93]You can take down enemies by hitting them with a rev roll.
[21:33.53]That's actually kind of fun.
[21:34.55]Oh, this game is pretty fun.
[21:36.27]Okay, that's a elevator.
[21:40.47]You don't want to press Y to open the gate in front.
[21:41.95]Did I miss anything?
[21:59.94]Look out, you can fall from here.
[22:01.14]Hold X while jumping to hang in mid-air.
[22:02.93]Try it if you're about to fall.
[22:03.99]Okay, easy enough.
[22:11.81]What's that?
[22:12.89]Oh!
[22:13.05]Alright, what's this mean?
[22:14.87]What does it say?
[22:17.74]Two?
[22:19.30]What does that say?
[22:20.06]Is that a two?
[22:22.56]Did I miss something?
[22:32.72]Blue switches are the strangest switches.
[22:34.68]Pressing one lets you press two.
[22:37.62]Okay.
[22:38.52]Go back and... Okay, that's what it means.
[22:40.23]I get it.
[22:45.05]This game looks pretty decent so far.
[22:46.41]Yeah, it actually kind of does.
[22:47.31]Okay.
[22:49.37]Fuck all that.
[22:57.41]What?
[22:58.95]What just happened?
[23:00.29]Okay, cool.
[23:00.65]Alright.
[23:04.81]What does that thing do?
[23:05.45]Is that just a button?
[23:14.21]This is a fruit door.
[23:15.47]There are switches, bonus letters, and other things to find on the other side.
[23:20.84]Sometimes there are even keys to rescue your friends with.
[23:23.48]Open all the fruit doors to rescue your friends.
[23:27.54]How do you open the fruit door?
[23:28.46]I need an apple.
[23:30.04]Where do I get an apple?
[23:32.73]Pressing the yellow switch will cause dots or power pedals to appear.
[23:37.43]Oh, there we go.
[23:38.21]Alright.
[23:39.35]Oh, that's what I got in my inventory.
[23:41.75]Cool.
[23:44.65]Let's go.
[23:47.86]Ghost boss Hawkman statue is up ahead.
[23:50.66]See if you can smash it.
[23:52.44]Got it.
[24:01.46]Oh, I missed the finger prop.
[24:02.46]I didn't think it was going to do that.
[24:09.47]Oh, yeah.
[24:10.09]Here we go.
[24:10.49]Let's do it.
[24:14.11]Slot bonus.
[24:16.09]So how do I bet?
[24:19.29]Okay, I got three coins.
[24:20.17]Do I have to stop it?
[24:28.82]Is this an...
[24:31.74]Alright, we're looking for a banana.
[24:33.73]Banana, stop.
[24:35.01]What are you doing?
[24:35.65]That wasn't a banana.
[24:36.51]That was not even close.
[24:38.11]That was a fucking lemon.
[24:40.49]Idiot.
[24:41.69]Banana, stop.
[24:44.11]Whatever.
[24:44.37]Do it again.
[24:49.52]Okay, so you need to do two, one or two before.
[24:53.88]So where's the orange?
[24:56.56]Orange, okay, it's banana, orange.
[24:58.24]But what's before banana?
[24:59.87]Cherry, okay, cherry, stop on cherry.
[25:03.41]What are you talking about?
[25:04.53]I have no idea what's going on.
[25:06.27]Can you read?
[25:09.39]How many can I read?
[25:12.88]Alright, teach.
[25:18.00]Dun dun dun.
[25:19.36]Dun dun dun.
[25:20.84]Dun dun dun dun.
[25:22.08]Dun dun dun dun.
[25:23.46]Dun dun dun dun.
[25:24.97]Dun dun dun dun.
[25:27.07]Dun dun dun dun.
[25:34.89]I just made a fucking million dollars.
[25:38.99]What did I just get?
[25:41.43]No miss?
[25:42.35]10,000?
[25:43.43]One 10,000 one-up?
[26:05.53]Alright, cool.
[26:07.15]That's a good start.
[26:13.63]Corsair's Cove episode unlocked.
[26:16.89]Oh, cool.
[26:17.43]I think should two headphones go in for this?
[26:19.31]That's actually kind of fun.
[26:21.13]I'm kind of excited.
[26:23.27]Pirate ship area.
[26:27.38]Choose your destination.
[26:28.26]Alright, I guess I'm just going to do this, right?
[26:34.24]What's this?
[26:42.21]What is this thing?
[26:47.55]View movies and credits.
[26:52.11]Oh, we didn't watch this.
[26:52.89]We have to watch the opening.
[26:53.73]We have to see what happens.
[27:02.92]Happy birthday.
[27:05.18]Whose birthday is it?
[27:05.86]Oh my god, that looks good.
[27:09.90]I think we wouldn't see them up there.
[27:22.53]Pac-Man, just pick up a fucking rock and throw it up there.
[27:38.13]Who's the dog?
[27:38.81]Is this a Pac-Man dog?
[27:45.00]What?
[27:55.95]So wait, Pac-Man has to eat a pellet for a ghost to get hurt.
[28:00.93]What are the rules there, though?
[28:03.01]Like, if I eat a power pellet and I throw a rock at a ghost, will it hurt them?
[28:09.71]Or do I have to physically bite them?
[28:19.04]Well, that doesn't make any sense because they just pick that guy up.
[28:23.06]There's obviously this physical stuff going on.
[28:25.74]They're able to touch and pick up things in the world.
[28:33.00]So you're telling me if I smash that glass pitcher over a ghost's head, it's going to go through them?
[28:39.00]That doesn't make any sense.
[28:58.82]You're a fake fan.
[29:00.46]I'm just kidding around.
[29:01.96]I'm just messing around.
[29:03.40]I'm just kidding around.
[29:04.24]I'm just messing around.
[29:05.18]I'm just messing around.
[29:05.94]I'm kidding.
[29:06.24]I'm just messing around.
[29:07.38]Okay, but what if one of the ghosts... Okay, what if... Hold on.
[29:18.65]I actually have a question.
[29:21.16]So the ghost, when Pac-Man eats a pellet, he turns into the Pac-Man thing.
[29:24.28]He can eat the ghost, turn blue.
[29:26.98]Could... Could a ghost get, like, struck by lightning and die?
[29:33.65]Like, could a ghost get, like, an anvil dropped on their head and die?
[29:37.39]If it had nothing to do with, like, a Pac-Man pellet.
[29:43.01]They already did that.
[29:43.75]Alright, let's go.
[29:50.88]I'm ready.
[29:53.92]There's one.
[29:59.11]Need a drone.
[30:05.35]I need a, I need a metal Mario.
[30:12.37]Is there a metal thing here?
[30:13.09]Shit.
[30:23.69]Lemon.
[30:24.81]Alright, let me out.
[30:33.58]Alright, let's blow through this.
[30:39.12]Oh, what?
[30:41.15]Oh, because they're ghosts.
[30:42.61]Okay.
[30:46.69]Well, that fucks my whole logic up.
[30:49.85]Wait.
[30:59.12]Oh my goodness.
[30:59.94]Alright, I got it.
[31:07.87]Alright, let's go.
[31:15.14]You're an idiot.
[31:15.86]I'm not an idiot.
[31:17.88]I didn't know that you had to... Whatever.
[31:19.64]I didn't know those were ghosts.
[31:22.22]They were pirates.
[31:23.16]Oh, fuck off.
[31:32.89]Wait, give me this.
[31:33.27]Is there another Metal Mario anywhere?
[31:37.52]There's right here.
[31:38.58]Hold on.
[31:42.17]How do I get up there?
[31:44.95]How did you not know?
[31:45.95]I mean, I know how it works.
[31:49.41]It's a 3D platformer.
[32:00.85]There we go.
[32:01.23]Is it not here anymore?
[32:04.51]I need another metal Mario thing.
[32:11.58]Is there one over here?
[32:12.86]I don't think you can drown.
[32:21.27]I don't think so, it doesn't feel like it.
[32:24.97]Can't go that way.
[32:31.65]Wall jump?
[32:36.40]This definitely, I'll probably unlock it in a minute.
[32:48.52]Oh, you definitely can't drown.
[32:49.30]I would have drowned already.
[32:50.04]I feel like I missed a bunch of shit.
[33:00.74]Did I?
[33:11.91]That made me so mad.
[33:13.03]Did you see that?
[33:14.47]I'm glad I had the camera on because I was actually fucking mad for one tenth of a second.
[33:19.53]It was just like, why did you do that?
[33:20.71]Here we go.
[33:23.29]Alright, we're good.
[33:23.83]Alright, gotta be quick.
[33:29.60]Strawberry?
[33:43.70]Can I get it again?
[33:47.36]Yeah, I felt my face go like this.
[33:53.63]Oh, there's pee for Pac-Man.
[33:56.01]You idiot.
[34:01.49]I like the sound when he walks.
[34:03.59]I think this is a cute game.
[34:04.59]How much is this game?
[34:15.00]There it is.
[34:15.48]Is the A?
[34:17.24]I don't know, dude.
[34:17.78]You bought it.
[34:18.36]I don't know.
[34:19.26]I don't remember.
[34:19.82]I bought it a while ago when it first came out.
[34:31.13]Still don't have that?
[34:34.20]It's 30 bucks.
[34:36.82]I knew it was under like 30 or 40.
[34:44.78]There it is.
[34:46.91]Dude, you were waiting at GameStop at midnight for this.
[34:49.53]Imagine getting that phone call.
[34:55.03]This is GameStop, where you can buy and sell used games, and make sure to check out Sonic the Hedgehog.
[35:00.93]It's coming out, by the way.
[35:01.77]Can I get an interview in pre-ordering Sonic the Hedgehog?
[35:05.06]Um, no, thank you.
[35:06.56]When does... Do you guys do a midnight release for Pac-Man World Repack?
[35:11.50]Yeah, you betcha, man.
[35:14.88]Okay.
[35:17.16]Yeah, should I write your name down as literally the only fucking person that's going to be here?
[35:21.44]Yeah.
[35:22.64]Okay.
[35:32.66]Ooh, nice, nice, nice.
[35:33.86]Give me it.
[35:40.96]And then at midnight, I just don't go.
[35:42.80]It's like, no, that's actually, I don't like, that's dumb.
[35:45.92]Don't they usually do midnight releases for different, you know, at the same time?
[35:48.14]Like, it'd be, oh, you can get Pac-Man World Repack or The Witcher 3, right?
[36:09.72]Don't they usually do that?
[36:12.06]I need to see.
[36:12.64]Yeah, where is it?
[36:16.06]I'm looking at chat.
[36:17.60]I'm not looking.
[36:18.24]Yeah, guys, I might be moving the character, but I'm reading what you're saying.
[36:27.93]Stop reading chat.
[36:29.51]No!
[36:29.99]I will never stop reading chat.
[36:31.93]I will never stop picking up the one person here that says that my hair looks like a mustache, or that it looks like my room smells like fucking... like pee.
[36:41.50]I'm gonna always read those.
[36:44.32]Like, hey dude, it looks like your room smells like pee.
[36:46.78]I'm going to read that, so I'm gonna be looking over here all the time.
[36:49.92]Where is it?
[36:55.82]Where is it?
[37:03.99]You guys told me I missed it.
[37:04.83]Where?
[37:07.47]Get the C. I don't... I don't... There's no C here.
[37:11.56]Where is it?
[37:13.28]What letter is that?
[37:15.56]Oh.
[37:16.62]How do I get that?
[37:17.42]Where's the C?
[37:22.14]Did you actually see it somewhere?
[37:35.84]Do I have that item?
[37:37.12]How do I look?
[37:41.28]I want whatever that is.
[37:43.68]Did you guys actually see the C?
[37:47.14]Probably somehow being a fucking weirdo.
[37:49.16]Did anybody actually see it?
[37:56.69]No, I gotta go back.
[38:00.83]I'm gonna die in this game and it's gonna be embarrassing in level 1.
[38:18.28]Oh my god, I just got so much.
[38:20.02]Now what?
[38:21.36]I can open the door down here.
[38:26.63]What is this?
[38:31.83]You got a maze.
[38:35.65]Oh, okay.
[38:37.98]I gotta get everything.
[38:39.88]If I don't get every single one of these, I'll delete my Twitch channel.
[39:52.40]You have to stick around.
[39:54.50]That was actually really close.
[39:56.46]That was way too close.
[39:58.66]I was very uncomfortable.
[40:01.08]I know it's a joke, right?
[40:02.19]But I was uncomfortable that whole time.
[40:04.33]I was... I was not doing okay.
[40:14.17]Okay.
[40:23.59]You would have done it.
[40:25.21]No, I would have found some dumb way to say, oh, well, I'll delete my Twitch channel eventually in 10 years.
[40:34.77]Or I would have said something dumb.
[40:35.72]Don't worry.
[40:36.22]Is that really all that did?
[40:43.50]Honestly, guys, where's the C?
[40:51.49]If I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, right?
[40:57.11]Oh, wait.
[40:59.07]Careful.
[40:59.74]Those are metal enemies.
[41:00.86]Oh, there it is.
[41:03.60]Perfect.
[41:09.45]Wait, I don't have that.
[41:18.24]This is it.
[41:19.54]There we go.
[41:20.14]I'm going to be able to do a lot of slot machine stuff later.
[41:23.84]Alright, just need the end.
[41:28.12]Thought I just got hurt.
[41:45.53]Change the music.
[41:48.55]Guys, I'm sorry.
[41:49.42]I cannot... I can't just turn on a different OST.
[41:53.60]This is what the game's soundtrack is.
[41:55.40]And it's cute.
[41:55.96]It's fine.
[41:57.10]You can't just put on blocked OST for every single game I play.
[42:04.66]Give me... Come on.
[42:05.39]Give me some slack.
[42:11.11]Alright, I got all... I got Pac-Man.
[42:24.15]We're at the end.
[42:27.75]Oh, my goodness.
[42:28.41]There's a lot of shit back here.
[42:31.07]Let me get... Hold on.
[42:31.95]Don't get too far ahead.
[42:33.11]No, not yet.
[42:40.21]Can't jump this.
[42:40.71]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[43:03.62]What's that?
[43:04.54]Ooh, a key.
[43:12.24]Why would you even change this music?
[43:15.29]It's Pac-Man music.
[43:18.15]Doesn't everybody universally love- I- Whatever.
[43:24.05]How about everybody universally loves Pac-Man music?
[43:41.89]Ooh.
[43:42.77]Wait, I'm gonna do this.
[43:52.57]Yep.
[44:00.64]Oh!
[44:00.88]Wait, bonus stage.
[44:02.86]That was a fake reaction, but whatever.
[44:05.02]I'll take it.
[44:05.52]Bonus stage?
[44:14.10]Okay I got it.
[44:17.26]Oh I can't get it.
[45:00.43]I got five spins.
[45:01.29]This is going to be huge.
[45:02.79]Alright.
[45:05.19]Can I max bet?
[45:06.01]Can I bet everything I have in one spin?
[45:17.94]Yeah.
[45:19.54]I got to try to get the the spaceship.
[45:26.22]Where's the spaceship?
[45:26.96]Okay, it's... One, two, three, four, five, six.
[45:35.93]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[45:39.97]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[45:45.71]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3.
[45:53.47]How did I do that?
[45:54.27]How did I mess that up?
[45:55.75]How is that possible?
[45:56.79]I don't know what happened.
[45:58.47]That's fucked up.
[45:59.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[46:02.17]That's okay.
[46:03.06]What a dork.
[46:18.22]Whatever.
[46:19.10]Give it.
[46:19.67]Let's do it.
[46:38.03]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[46:41.92]One, two, three.
[46:43.90]This music beat is fucking me up.
[46:45.82]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[46:49.86]One, two, three.
[46:51.76]Why is my voice getting deeper?
[46:52.81]What's happening?
[46:53.37]Whoa!
[46:54.33]What the fuck is going on?
[46:55.75]I was like going, I was getting, I was, I was, what the fuck kind of gas was I just inhaling?
[47:09.56]one two three four one two one two three four oh my god whatever I got I I won once I'm fine I have 14 uh extra lives guys sorry 18. I have 18 lives
[47:36.10]I don't think I'm going to use more than two of these.
[47:38.40]So don't worry.
[47:45.24]Crazy cannonade.
[47:57.11]I almost have the area one boss.
[47:58.45]When are you going to finally play EVE online?
[48:05.58]Um.
[48:08.36]Isn't that the game where sometimes it takes, like, five years for there to be real, like, geopolitical fights and stuff?
[48:18.35]And after, like, a half decade, there's, like, a battle and you just lose everything?
[48:25.87]That game is intense.
[48:28.93]You want to talk about a roguelike?
[48:33.68]One run could take four or five years.
[48:39.49]That's a really cool concept for a game, I will say.
[48:42.89]But I'm way too impatient for it.
[48:45.91]Didn't think I was going to get up here, did you?
[49:00.17]It's just Excel spreadsheets in an MMO.
[49:06.08]Wasn't there something that happened not that long ago?
[49:09.69]It was like the biggest EVE Online fight ever in history.
[49:12.95]It was like thousands of people.
[49:15.57]It was like the ultimate... It was like the Infinity War.
[49:22.05]When was the EVE Online endgame?
[49:29.00]It was pretty recently, wasn't it?
[49:30.98]Five years ago?
[49:31.56]It was the Fountain War.
[49:36.51]Why'd you go Batchesting?
[49:37.57]Oh, it's because I said Marvel.
[49:40.68]Oh, I gotta get up there.
[49:47.60]Did I just ruin my chance to get up there?
[49:49.96]The enemies respawned.
[49:55.70]Come on, did I really ruin it?
[50:07.88]There it is.
[50:09.18]Alright, we're good.
[50:18.97]What is that?
[50:20.71]That's not the fruit I need.
[50:21.47]I need an apple.
[50:33.38]The EVE Online big battle nearly cost $400,000 in damages.
[50:36.38]Oh my god.
[50:36.84]That's crazy.
[50:37.64]Oh, okay.
[50:38.12]$400,000.
[50:38.18]I would be so scared to play that kind of game.
[51:08.75]And whenever I play an MMO, I always want to hold on to every single thing I've ever collected.
[51:25.38]So thinking and knowing that, you could lose a half of a decade of progress and you're just gone.
[51:33.41]And that guy stole it over there.
[51:36.87]Part of that group or that team or whatever.
[51:47.77]Hold on now.
[51:51.38]That's the first time that's been possible.
[52:06.27]This looks like Mario 3D World.
[52:08.81]This is Pac-Man World Repack.
[52:14.92]Wait, what am I doing?
[52:22.27]Why can't I hit the back wall?
[52:23.61]The wall?
[52:23.93]That's the the art in the background.
[52:26.21]How is that possible?
[52:31.56]Why can't I hit the background art?
[52:32.80]Can I get up?
[52:40.26]Hold on.
[52:41.10]No.
[52:51.32]I thought I could move it.
[52:53.20]I thought I could move it as the big easy mode.
[52:55.38]Oh my god.
[52:55.76]What is easy mode?
[52:56.70]I'm getting Luigi'd right now.
[53:22.60]What is that?
[53:23.14]No.
[53:23.82]No.
[53:24.16]You can hang for a long time in the air.
[53:28.90]Okay.
[53:34.60]Let Luigi play.
[53:45.09]You know, I always say that.
[53:47.05]I've never played that game.
[53:48.49]I just know that that's... You know what?
[53:50.35]Maybe I have.
[53:51.71]No, I did and I hated it.
[53:53.03]That's right.
[53:53.99]That's right.
[53:56.61]I played Super Mario 3D World and I fucking hated every second of it.
[54:00.10]I really did.
[54:00.72]I thought it was the worst Mario game ever.
[54:06.26]I thought it was so awful.
[54:07.72]I hated every waking moment of playing that game.
[54:11.65]I'm sorry.
[54:12.73]I had the same conversation a couple years ago about it.
[54:20.52]I know it's a weird opinion, but I really did.
[54:22.74]I just didn't like it at all.
[54:27.34]And I always go into stuff with an open mind.
[54:29.06]I really do.
[54:29.94]Especially a Mario game.
[54:31.07]You know, Mario Galaxy.
[54:32.65]Oh my god.
[54:33.21]Mario Galaxy.
[54:35.25]Mario Sunshine.
[54:38.49]Mario 64.
[54:38.77]I love that shit.
[54:47.21]3D World or 3D Land?
[54:48.33]What's the side-scrolling one?
[54:51.13]The side-scrolling... New Super Mario Bros.
[54:54.69]Wii.
[54:55.49]That's what I'm thinking of.
[54:56.71]No, not 3D World.
[54:58.01]New Super Mario Bros.
[54:59.42]Wii.
[55:00.70]With the two Toads.
[55:02.08]That one sucks.
[55:03.08]That one sucks.
[55:03.92]Ass.
[55:04.94]That's the one I'm thinking of.
[55:05.62]I need the A. No, not Mario Maker.
[55:11.10]I'm thinking of... Oh my god!
[55:12.99]There's nothing...
[55:20.71]Where's the A?
[55:22.41]I don't think I think I can't get it.
[55:27.22]I can't go back.
[55:28.20]I can't go back.
[55:31.02]The A is gone forever.
[55:32.18]I can't go back.
[55:32.78]Oh, well, wait.
[55:38.98]No, I can't make that.
[55:49.33]I can't go back.
[55:54.37]Yeah, new Super Mario Brothers Wii.
[55:57.57]The one where you stuck to walls.
[56:00.29]My God.
[56:00.95]That was so bad.
[56:22.20]That's how far you can throw this?
[56:27.81]Can I aim it anywhere else?
[56:29.15]That's so bad.
[56:30.41]Do I have the orange?
[56:43.36]Is that... Wait, that's a... That's not right.
[56:53.53]Wait a minute.
[56:55.37]This is a long one.
[56:59.57]I think I just walked out from there.
[57:00.88]No!
[57:00.98]That's the M. Shit.
[57:01.54]Oh well.
[57:01.98]You can't get everything.
[57:03.12]Alright, I gotta come back here because there's a bonus level.
[57:29.23]Can I climb that or anything?
[57:41.78]Jump on his head.
[57:42.60]There it is.
[57:45.42]OK, made it.
[58:01.41]People play the Pac-Man games actually?
[58:04.19]Um, yeah, I mean, I'm doing it right now.
[58:06.22]I'm here right now playing it.
[58:10.43]Wish I could have done that before.
[58:32.74]Don't come over here.
[58:33.22]I mean, if I don't get all these, if I don't get every single one of these, I will eat my Twitch channel.
[59:20.71]Spawn camping.
[59:21.35]You already did that joke.
[59:22.19]Yeah, I did.
[59:23.89]Reuse joke Andy.
[59:33.88]I'm pissed that I missed the A. Alright, let me ask you guys this question.
[59:40.84]What do you think is the best...
[59:44.93]Mario video game that has come out.
[59:47.64]Ever.
[59:47.90]And I'm talking across every platform.
[59:50.50]By the way, there are some that are grayed out.
[59:53.48]Mario 64 is grayed out.
[59:57.38]As well as Super Mario World for the SNES.
[60:00.01]Those are both grayed out.
[60:04.41]You cannot pick those.
[60:05.11]They're grayed out.
[60:05.65]They're SS tier.
[60:06.87]You can't touch them.
[60:14.44]Odyssey.
[60:15.74]Odyssey was very... Yeah, Odyssey was very good.
[60:22.11]Odyssey was very good.
[60:25.07]I still think it's probably Galaxy.
[60:26.60]Although Galaxy made me puke.
[60:27.92]Well, I didn't actually throw up, but it made me feel like I was going to.
[60:44.13]What's the wrong button?
[60:47.01]Good thing I have a lot of lives.
[60:48.31]What did I say?
[60:48.65]I was going to go through two the whole game?
[60:51.07]That was inaccurate.
[60:58.38]I need to switch that right now.
[60:59.76]Okay, in every single video game you've ever played, is it hang in midair?
[61:06.16]Is the jump button again?
[61:08.50]But I can't make it that.
[61:13.14]right it's usually like a right a but it's a and then x that feels weird god damn it I want to hover I don't want to fall straight down I want to go like this but I have to hit the it's not jump
[61:54.92]Ooh!
[61:55.34]Okay.
[61:56.02]Let's go!
[61:57.16]Oh my god, get out of the fucking way.
[62:08.22]No!
[62:25.32]Oh well.
[62:26.92]How did I miss the other egg?
[62:28.80]3D Gary, that's me.
[62:37.96]Alright.
[62:57.93]Alright, let's go.
[63:00.57]Did I miss the end?
[63:06.69]I might have.
[63:07.75]I don't even know why this moves in the game.
[63:13.22]It's truly bad.
[63:19.00]Lower the game volume?
[63:20.12]I'm trying to sleep.
[63:23.64]Dude, just lower the stream volume!
[63:27.90]Lower the screen volume.
[63:29.37]You have a volume control.
[63:31.29]Hold up your... Just click, click, click, click down a few times.
[63:34.13]You can do that on your own.
[63:35.53]I don't have to do that.
[63:42.01]You know what would have been really funny is if you said, Hey, Jerma, can you turn down your screen's audio?
[63:46.48]I'm too lazy to do it myself.
[63:47.98]That would have been like, alright, that's funny.
[64:07.88]Why does it feel like I can go down there?
[64:09.22]I don't know why.
[64:13.08]I just saw the sand.
[64:14.12]Whatever.
[64:18.92]Nice spam.
[64:35.88]He's spamming.
[64:44.94]Can we lower your voice?
[64:46.44]I'm watching this at full volume at my mother's funeral.
[64:50.89]That's very odd.
[65:07.21]full volume you see the thing is you're just gonna look like a lunatic right that's not that's I have nothing to do with this oh it's ticked up they're not gonna think you're watching a stream they're gonna think you're playing pac-man really loudly that's all the noise is that you can really decipher it
[65:36.38]You're just going to hear like... You're just going to be like this.
[65:42.10]Oh my God, what are you doing?
[65:48.50]Stop swearing in front of your mom's coffin.
[66:00.07]Imagine... I can't believe this.
[66:04.21]I hate my mom's funeral.
[66:05.25]This guy, can you believe what this guy's saying?
[66:10.07]Oh my god, I'm so bad.
[66:10.99]Alright, I'm gonna try to actually get it.
[66:18.88]One and a two and a three and a four and a one and a two and a three and a four.
[66:33.63]It's gotta be faster.
[66:36.47]This is how I can keep tempo.
[66:38.83]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[66:42.45]Five, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, oh my god.
[66:54.29]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[66:57.23]Ah.
[66:57.35]Five, six.
[67:06.67]four five six seven one two and three four one two start over one two three four five six seven three four five six one two three four five six oops
[67:42.42]Whatever.
[67:43.20]Fuck it.
[67:46.78]Why am I sweating through this shirt?
[67:48.46]What's happening?
[67:51.74]I wonder what the bosses are like.
[68:04.47]Hey dude, can you speak up?
[68:08.17]I'm in a construction site.
[68:17.40]Okay, hold on.
[68:20.38]This is important.
[68:22.40]Okay, I got something.
[68:26.10]Bear with me for one minute.
[68:28.74]I'm going to try to be very straight-faced about this.
[68:31.16]Let's see if I can do it.
[68:56.05]Like this is this just a ton of work going on.
[69:00.15]They're building a skyscraper next to me.
[69:14.54]This sounds pretty good, 10 hours of construction sounds.
[69:25.40]This is challenge.
[69:26.49]Watch the full video.
[69:32.79]This is too obvious.
[69:43.66]It's got to be way louder than me, right?
[69:46.24]Like I could turn myself down.
[69:48.33]I'm going to turn myself down.
[69:55.09]What else do I need?
[69:56.07]That's it, right?
[70:22.92]It's got to be louder than the game, too, somehow, right?
[70:25.46]Like, why would that be?
[70:26.44]Why would it be louder than the game?
[70:28.86]Why can't you look at the game as loud as I can?
[70:34.62]Can you guess his name?
[70:48.84]There's nothing I can do about it.
[71:51.94]I don't think I can make it.
[72:49.81]This move won't hurt you at all.
[72:52.63]Is it fine now?
[72:53.89]Alright, let's go.
[72:57.67]Okay, that's enough.
[73:06.65]That's enough.
[73:07.11]That's enough.
[73:08.83]Okay.
[73:09.63]I don't know if I can take that anymore.
[73:11.67]I was like, why is it still on?
[73:17.67]That was this.
[73:19.78]It's still on?
[73:51.48]We're good.
[73:55.09]We're good.
[73:59.73]Oh, it's because I... Whoops.
[74:04.49]Uh-oh.
[74:05.39]It's... Evil Pac-Man!
[74:16.17]Oh, I have to turn that off.
[74:18.66]This is still on.
[74:23.22]This would be the time for you to be able to throw a grenade, Pac-Man.
[74:43.35]I don't get it.
[74:43.75]I mean, does it have to hit something?
[74:52.43]Did that work?
[74:58.74]Why does this audio sound like it's on a compressed YouTube video?
[75:08.60]Oh, it's firing back.
[75:10.84]What?
[75:41.96]Oh shit, alright.
[75:44.68]Didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't.
[75:46.80]I knew it could get faster.
[75:47.76]Point.
[76:08.87]Um what?
[76:09.95]With each.
[76:19.61]Alright, one more hit and that's it.
[76:47.34]Got it.
[76:49.46]This is your worst stream.
[76:50.26]10 out of 10.
[76:52.22]Sorry about the construction, dude.
[76:53.92]I'm really sorry about the construction.
[76:56.28]Yeah, I banned that person.
[76:57.68]Banned that person for like at least a day.
[76:59.04]Banned that person for a full day.
[77:00.62]I missed everything because of that.
[77:03.04]I want that person banned for a day.
[77:04.52]At least 24 hours.
[77:07.44]Oh my god, I missed everything.
[77:09.20]What the fuck?
[77:10.20]That was everything.
[77:11.06]That was so much coins and shit.
[77:27.47]Permanently ban that person.
[77:28.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[77:29.41]Permanent ban is like 10 minutes.
[77:32.55]Saying I'm going to ban you for a day means you're going to be gone for like a month.
[77:35.59]Saying ban that person for 10 minutes means don't actually ban them at all.
[77:52.77]I'm looking at the mod chat.
[77:53.73]So do you actually want us to ban that guy or not?
[77:56.65]Question marks.
[77:57.47]The four people have written question marks in the mod chat.
[78:00.17]Five now.
[78:03.26]Um, no.
[78:20.53]three four five six go one two three four five six go fuck you it's a lemon worth it was so confusing it happened in a weird timing whatever
[78:49.52]I thought this was Pac-Man.
[79:10.96]It is Pac-Man.
[79:11.58]There's slot machines in Pac-Man?
[79:19.01]Please don't ban me.
[79:20.21]I'm not gonna ban you.
[79:21.09]I'm kidding.
[79:27.21]Alright, so I think we're almost... Wait a minute.
[79:30.49]Our best friend Dig Dug is here.
[79:35.99]Oh, this is Pooka.
[79:37.17]Okay.
[79:39.93]Oh, so we have like a friend.
[79:40.79]This is pretty sick.
[79:46.13]Pac-Man will go to any lengths to beat you, Pac-Man.
[79:48.53]Be careful.
[79:50.33]You kind of look like Pac-Man.
[80:04.22]I think I did it, right?
[80:06.53]Or is this a... Yep, that's a wooden bag.
[80:08.91]Alright, let's go to the next area.
[80:13.97]You have a void expression.
[80:15.45]Pac-Man is very, look, this is a void expression.
[80:20.36]He's smiling.
[80:24.72]Really?
[80:25.92]That's a void expression?
[80:27.22]He's, look at how happy he is.
[80:28.46]Like, yeah, that's fun.
[80:36.73]Oh, there's a space area.
[80:37.87]Ooh.
[80:44.67]Okay, let's go to the first level.
[80:51.30]Oh, I can switch between them?
[80:54.10]Fast travel?
[80:55.10]I guess that makes sense eventually if you wanted to go back.
[80:57.12]Alright, let's go.
[81:06.19]I think we're going to get a cool music change.
[81:08.01]People are going to be very excited about this.
[81:16.10]That hurt.
[81:16.48]Wait, something up there?
[81:17.42]No?
[81:44.55]Alright, that's good.
[81:56.08]You do the jackhammer sounds with your mouth.
[82:05.98]Probably.
[82:11.49]No, I can't.
[82:13.57]Tried.
[82:30.54]Oh, a lemon.
[82:38.90]I want maximum coins for maximum gambling.
[82:46.93]I'm not even touching it.
[82:58.26]No!
[82:58.90]Alright, don't get hit.
[83:09.76]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[83:14.74]Am I having fun?
[83:15.48]Yeah.
[83:16.40]I'm having fun.
[83:22.22]I'm having fun.
[83:22.78]I just have an itchy face.
[83:26.28]Can somebody explain to me what that is, by the way?
[83:28.36]Like, for some reason, randomly.
[83:37.33]just pieces of my face will be itchy it'll be like scratchy ooh like what does that mean why do I just and I'll be normal for a whole day and then it'll just my face will just start itching in random places
[83:59.22]Dead skin?
[84:01.03]You have too much skin there.
[84:02.13]Did somebody just say, I don't know, dude, take your shirt off.
[84:15.98]That's not what I asked.
[84:18.32]I was asking, that's not what I was, what are you talking, why, ban that person for 10 minutes.
[84:32.91]Did I get a... I did.
[84:34.09]Okay, I gotta go back.
[84:34.73]Don't.
[84:50.16]Don't!
[84:57.74]The only... See what I'm talking about?
[84:59.32]It's like itchy right there.
[85:02.10]And it wasn't itchy there five minutes ago.
[85:12.01]What the fuck?
[85:12.91]Okay, whatever.
[85:13.39]It's because there are worms in your face.
[85:22.69]Alright.
[85:24.91]I've done two out of two.
[85:26.23]Let's see if I can do three out of three.
[85:31.67]Can they get hit by those beams too?
[85:33.07]Nope, sorry.
[85:33.75]You can't hit a ghost with a glass bottle, so they can't get hurt by that.
[85:37.91]I understand.
[85:38.31]I remember the logic from earlier.
[85:39.35]Should have gone the other way.
[85:40.99]That's a classic rookie pack man mistake.
[85:44.53]I should have gone the other way.
[86:03.63]actually a rookie mistake.
[86:32.87]why is that even here oh come on I was fine I had it right there that was dumb it's stage hazards on a pac-man game this game has ass cheeks
[87:02.57]I thought it looked really weird doing that.
[87:04.35]How weird did that look?
[87:05.41]That's why I never have the camera on.
[87:06.75]Very.
[87:06.89]Okay, good.
[87:33.70]Holy shit.
[87:45.39]Whoa.
[87:53.37]I'm too big to fit through here.
[87:54.73]No.
[87:54.89]Oh, why does it feel like such a failure?
[88:13.80]What are you doing?
[88:14.80]When are you going to play Splatoon 3?
[88:33.62]After I play Splatoon 1 and 2, which I have not done yet.
[88:40.94]I don't like Splatoon, I told you already.
[88:42.59]Because it reminds me of that old Tony Hawk multiplayer game mode.
[88:46.91]And I would just get infuriated at it.
[89:04.41]Um, I think I got one of these, right?
[89:06.03]Isn't there a door back here I can do?
[89:16.78]you're a monster um no so the the Tony Hawk pro skater had this mode where I think it was called tagging or graffiti mode or something and I would always get so screwed because a buddy of mine would get a 1 million point streak because how it worked is everything you touched in a combo
[89:42.41]you have whatever you touch during the combo would turn into your team's color and I would just be playing and getting areas and oh yeah I got the railing I got this ramp and then somebody that was really good at the game would just fly through to a million point thing on it across the whole game and then I just had to literally sit around and do nothing because I could never get it back
[90:03.81]I played Splatoon for the first time and it just brought back those awful memories of... Oh, let's go!
[90:09.53]I'm going for it!
[90:10.47]I'm doing a good job!
[90:12.51]I painted so much!
[90:13.42]And then I turn around and the whole thing is gone.
[90:15.64]And we just get absolutely dominated.
[90:17.12]So you're bad.
[90:17.66]Yeah.
[90:17.82]Yes.
[90:34.88]Yes, I'm very bad at that game.
[90:36.82]Yes.
[90:40.34]Okay.
[90:47.89]Mad because bad?
[90:48.85]No, no, I'm not.
[90:50.47]I'm just bad at that game.
[90:52.89]That's it.
[90:53.19]There's no argument.
[90:54.65]There is no argument.
[90:56.25]I know people expect... Okay, this is a funny thing.
[90:58.99]Like, oh, mad because bad.
[91:00.73]Oh, you suck at it.
[91:01.71]That's why.
[91:02.13]Yeah.
[91:07.23]But... No, you're mad.
[91:09.81]You gotta get mad because you're not good at it.
[91:12.35]Like, no, yeah, I'm terrible at it.
[91:13.73]I'm dogshit at it.
[91:14.87]That's why I don't play it.
[91:20.15]Shit.
[91:21.09]Alright, well, thanks for the stream.
[91:24.46]How do I get out of here?
[91:25.22]I'm stuck in here now.
[91:26.84]What?
[91:27.06]I need to wash your neck?
[91:33.68]What's wrong with it?
[91:39.07]You know where I do get mad, right?
[91:40.53]For instance, if you say, dude, oh, why?
[91:42.98]You don't like it because you suck at it.
[91:44.18]You're just shitty at Splatoon.
[91:45.50]Yeah, Splatoon.
[91:46.62]Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely.
[91:48.34]Please continue to ridicule me because I agree with you.
[91:51.06]But if I'm playing Elden Ring and I see like mad because bad, it's like, shut the fuck up.
[91:55.34]How fuck you?
[91:55.94]How dare you?
[91:57.30]I know that I'm playing this game pretty well and like I'm having a lot of trouble on this boss.
[92:01.21]How dare you, right?
[92:02.41]There's a difference.
[92:04.85]Where's the end?
[92:11.50]Well, whatever.
[92:19.72]If this is a game that you know you like, and you're having trouble with it, if somebody says, wow, dude, skill issue.
[92:25.77]Like, fuck, I like this game.
[92:27.95]I want to be good at this game.
[92:36.86]I didn't even mean to do that.
[92:38.08]I just literally pressed the button three times.
[92:39.42]And I just got it.
[92:47.51]Alright, I get too much rice.
[92:51.41]Cherry's kind of worth nothing.
[92:57.47]Why is the cherry so hard to get?
[92:58.52]It's not even that big of a deal.
[93:03.56]I thought I saw red.
[93:16.54]You do a ball pit stream?
[93:28.15]Oh, I might get lost.
[93:32.25]That would be one of those streams be like, guys, I'm here.
[93:34.93]I've rented out a whole play place and let's go and have cameras everywhere.
[93:39.05]It's oh, wow.
[93:40.51]I can't believe it.
[93:41.27]It's just so fun.
[93:43.63]And then we just we go to a BRB at one point.
[93:45.95]I'm in like the tube hanging out.
[93:48.03]Wow, he went down the slide.
[93:49.17]Alright, we'll be right back.
[93:50.13]And then you come back from the break and I'm just gone.
[93:52.64]It's like, where is he?
[93:54.12]Where the fuck is he?
[93:56.52]I'm just like in the ball pit.
[94:10.36]Vlad?
[94:17.51]It would be the first BRB.
[94:18.91]It would literally be BRB 1 after 15 minutes.
[94:21.79]Okay.
[94:36.49]Dude, the ball pit is gross.
[94:37.97]I... I don't... I'm not... I don't... Yeah, I don't... I would... Yeah, uh-oh.
[95:00.20]Ball pit of despair.
[95:03.99]Anything over here?
[95:09.67]Dude, you've eaten boogers.
[95:10.81]You can't say that ball pits are gross.
[95:14.96]Would you eat somebody else's boogers?
[95:17.86]Would you eat someone else's boogers?
[95:20.23]Yes or no?
[95:21.19]The answer is absolutely no.
[95:23.51]So what are you talking about?
[95:27.63]If you've eaten boogers in your whole life before, and by the way, can we just back up a little bit?
[95:32.61]Can we just take a quick little break and understand?
[95:35.77]I don't do this shit.
[95:37.20]I don't eat boogers.
[95:38.48]What are you describing?
[95:40.60]When did I eat boogers on stream?
[95:43.46]I'm a grown man.
[95:45.36]When did I eat boogers?
[95:47.86]I'm not following when this happened.
[95:54.92]When was this?
[96:02.32]You said you were going to drink Ster's loogie.
[96:07.28]That's... No, but that's... Hold on.
[96:09.41]But that was for a very specific joke routine that I was going to commit to.
[96:19.42]I wasn't sitting there like, oh!
[96:21.50]Oh, boogers!
[96:22.00]Okay, shut up.
[96:23.22]Everyone stop talking now.
[96:24.40]Are you fucking up my game?
[96:26.40]Why the fuck did I just do that?
[96:27.79]I hate... Oh my god, what an idiot.
[96:31.11]What a fucking idiot.
[96:31.97]I forget that people just will clip that and share it with everybody.
[96:35.05]Oh, look what he said!
[96:35.83]He said, boogers!
[96:42.21]I'm too old for this.
[96:43.47]I'm too old for this, I am.
[96:45.87]I'm way too old for this.
[96:51.08]Oh my god, I'm getting flustered.
[96:52.76]I actually am.
[96:53.82]I like this music.
[97:11.32]Wait.
[97:14.96]What?
[97:24.58]Oh my goodness.
[97:26.22]Alright, relax.
[97:37.35]Can't hit it.
[97:38.21]Okay, that guy's electrified.
[97:39.03]I can't hurt him.
[97:43.23]Oh, this is going to be sick.
[97:57.29]Oh my god, and look what happened.
[98:00.44]Look what happened.
[98:00.98]Look what's going on over here in this chat.
[98:02.94]Everyone's talking about it now.
[98:15.69]Oh, Grandpa Pac-Man is here.
[98:27.39]Can I rescue Grandpa?
[98:29.07]Oh, come on.
[98:29.75]What?
[98:29.95]What is this?
[98:53.04]I ate the booger.
[98:54.22]I'm a booger eater, okay?
[98:56.12]This is a booger eating stream.
[98:58.54]I'm just eating boogers.
[99:00.38]When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.
[99:03.50]That's what I do.
[99:06.94]Where's this from?
[99:09.21]Why did I say that?
[99:10.25]What was the point of me saying this?
[99:11.45]I don't get it.
[99:14.93]I ate the booger.
[99:16.13]I'm a booger eater, okay?
[99:18.03]This is a booger eating stream.
[99:20.45]I'm just eating boogers.
[99:22.29]When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.
[99:25.39]That's what I do.
[99:27.17]I... That's a stream from three years ago.
[99:34.51]Oh my goodness.
[99:38.49]No, never mind.
[99:39.75]I thought my microphone was messed up.
[99:41.47]It actually might be.
[99:43.37]Hold on.
[99:48.83]Oh yeah, it is.
[99:50.93]Have you been hearing double this whole time?
[99:58.81]No?
[99:59.11]Okay.
[100:00.77]That's from three years ago.
[100:01.95]But yeah, it was definitely a joke though.
[100:03.37]I was probably just making a stupid joke.
[100:23.24]Can you imagine admitting to 700,000 people and current viewers that you eat boogers on stream?
[100:31.68]I mean, what the fuck?
[100:41.84]Where's this key?
[100:43.02]Jesus.
[100:52.84]700,000 viewers.
[100:53.80]Yeah, my channel's like really dropped a lot.
[100:57.25]You guys weren't here three or four years ago.
[100:58.47]I was averaging three to 500,000 concurrent viewers every day.
[101:02.21]I mean, the stream kind of fell.
[101:04.20]Once I started doing like the booger reading stuff and like jokes that people thought were like shitty, I lost a lot of people, I think.
[101:13.55]I was actually really surprised that, you know, like doing a routine where I like eat a bunch of boogers on stream was like, oh, maybe it was funny for a minute, but I lost like three or 400,000 people concurrently.
[101:23.58]So like I try to see like if the joke will land first before I do it.
[101:31.23]That's kind of frustrating, but whatever.
[101:38.65]That was my favorite stream.
[101:40.53]Yeah, I mean, like some people thought it was funny, but... Alright, let's rescue Grandpa.
[102:00.51]Thanks, Pac-Man.
[102:01.25]I'll wait for you up ahead.
[102:08.32]I don't have the apple.
[102:13.98]Oh, now I do.
[102:19.57]I gotta make sure I don't die.
[102:26.57]That scared the shit out of me.
[102:27.53]I didn't think it was going to go that far.
[102:35.23]oh Jesus I'm not reading that one it was up
[103:17.92]Oh, secret!
[103:31.93]Don't.
[103:33.57]I gotta bounce from here.
[103:34.43]This is kind of hard.
[103:44.10]How do I get that?
[103:46.82]Not like that.
[103:47.82]Oh my god.
[103:48.48]I'm going all the way back, aren't I?
[103:51.78]Thank goodness.
[103:53.00]Thank god.
[103:57.56]Where am I?
[104:00.24]Alright, I got it.
[104:18.95]Alright, let's get it.
[104:29.26]There's the A. Ooh.
[104:36.06]Ooh.
[104:40.50]Read it.
[104:40.96]Read what?
[104:44.47]I mean, read what?
[104:45.33]What am I supposed to read?
[104:47.93]How long is... Oh.
[104:55.38]That looks like I can get it, doesn't it?
[104:56.69]Nana?
[105:26.69]Hey, I got it!
[105:27.97]Pac-Man!
[105:34.51]This is gonna be a big one.
[105:35.33]Whoa!
[106:01.89]Got them all.
[106:03.13]Oh, it died.
[106:08.66]Whoa, big one, dude.
[106:09.62]Yeah, I know.
[106:10.32]I was pretty hogged up with that one.
[106:18.61]We're good.
[106:19.05]Ooh, whoa!
[106:38.93]Oh my god.
[106:40.16]I'm fine.
[106:46.60]Oh my goodness.
[106:51.58]How do I get back up?
[106:59.68]Dude, get up!
[107:02.19]What the fuck is this here for if I can't do it?
[107:28.16]You look like you know French.
[107:29.40]I don't.
[107:32.70]I don't know any other languages.
[107:39.44]I can't learn another language.
[107:41.43]I know everybody says that.
[107:42.53]Like, oh no, you know, there's this program you can learn.
[107:45.45]It's really easy.
[107:46.29]No, not for me.
[107:47.11]Whatever.
[108:03.02]Yeah, I definitely could not.
[108:13.38]I, whatever.
[108:13.90]You would need a reason.
[108:20.10]Um, I mean, you could learn a language too.
[108:24.37]You don't have to have a reason to learn French or Spanish or you can just do it just because.
[108:39.80]I speak three languages and I'm not even 18.
[108:41.44]I mean, that's... that's a huge skill to have, it really is.
[108:48.66]Think about... think about this.
[108:51.24]It's... Oh.
[108:55.47]I can only truly communicate... with a very limited amount of people.
[109:02.53]I only know English.
[109:05.74]My communication ability is much lower than yours.
[109:13.13]It's weird to think about that.
[109:24.81]Ever heard of Google Translate?
[109:27.61]Dude, there's a huge difference between Google Translate and truly being able to be at a restaurant and talk to the person or be able to communicate with somebody online and just be able to speak fluently and just completely understand.
[109:41.58]I'm not talking about like opening up the little book and being like, okay, where does, um, how do I go to the bathroom?
[109:47.74]No, I'm talking about you truly fluently understand the language like in and out completely.
[110:01.56]Because even if you use a translator, you are not truly understanding what you are saying.
[110:06.89]You are just phonetically repeating something, because you know that's what it's supposed to sound like.
[110:12.01]You're not truly comprehending what you're saying.
[110:15.97]You're looking at a thing that's telling you what to say.
[110:19.40]You don't know exactly why or how, unless you actually learn the language fluently.
[110:35.54]Nice to see.
[110:42.43]Well, that's pretty.
[110:44.81]There's no way to even gauge how far you're jumping.
[110:48.77]He sounds like a teacher.
[110:52.78]Hold on, sorry, let me correct that.
[110:55.82]Boogers, right?
[110:56.62]Is that what you want?
[110:58.62]Is that what you're looking for?
[111:00.66]Let me rephrase that.
[111:05.52]What I meant to say was... Let me make it so you guys can understand.
[111:29.50]What's wrong with you?
[111:30.72]You get it.
[111:31.44]You understand why I just did that.
[111:33.90]If you don't know why I just did that, come on, Gwen.
[111:36.54]You know what I mean?
[111:37.72]Come on.
[111:46.05]Wrong.
[111:46.37]I'm pressing A to hover.
[111:50.49]No, I don't want to play in easy mode.
[111:52.53]I'm holding A to hover because every other video game I've ever played was hold the jump button to hover.
[111:57.73]Every time you've seen me skyrocket to the goddamn ground.
[112:21.91]god x x hold x hold x hold the x button hold x to do this x hold x no depth perception no it's called remembering muscle memory
[112:44.28]for every single platforming video game with a jump that's ever been recorded in human history since when the cavemen were making video games.
[113:01.88]Rump?
[113:05.84]Alright, settle down.
[113:14.40]This game's not that fucking hard, man.
[113:16.15]I got it.
[113:16.65]Relax.
[113:17.16]I'm going to be fine.
[113:44.42]See, I figured it out.
[113:53.92]Where's your face?
[113:58.11]I'm here.
[114:28.40]No, no, no.
[114:29.22]I want to explore.
[114:42.14]Yeah, the grenade works on those guys.
[114:50.61]Pac-Man, please.
[114:51.83]Enough of that.
[114:57.57]Yes!
[115:00.21]game is this this is called pac-man world repack it's on Steam and maybe somewhere else I got it on Steam yeah it's a remake from an old PlayStation
[115:41.96]I got everything, right?
[115:47.77]Yep.
[116:12.16]Hogman?
[116:13.04]Yeah!
[116:15.98]Alright, I'm not gonna screw this up.
[116:24.41]I got plenty of time to do this.
[116:25.31]Let's just go do it right.
[116:26.63]I don't need to jump.
[116:30.47]That's good.
[116:35.10]Ohhhh!
[117:07.10]I got everything.
[117:08.36]Yeah, I'm good.
[117:17.59]Your hair looks like it would fit really nicely on a groomed dog.
[117:24.05]If I saw this kind of hair on a dog, I'd be very confused.
[117:27.59]That would be very confusing.
[117:33.11]Why does that dog have human hair?
[117:34.77]It's like a one, one, two, three.
[117:46.16]God damn it.
[117:59.53]I gotta sit further back.
[118:09.07]They're all blending together.
[118:09.85]Why are they all blending together?
[118:49.67]Oh my god, there's so many strawberries on this one.
[118:57.74]I thought it was one, two, three in a row.
[118:59.32]Like, one, then whatever.
[119:00.70]One, two, three, four, five.
[119:11.24]One, two, three, four.
[119:16.89]Oh my god.
[119:32.18]You suck!
[119:33.54]Hey!
[119:35.98]Alright, we're at the boss.
[119:37.81]Get hype!
[119:43.71]Why do you look so mad all the time?
[119:44.91]That's just my face dude.
[119:52.87]This is awesome.
[120:05.93]Pac-Man is a power pellet.
[120:07.01]When you grab one, cannons are powered up for a short time.
[120:15.65]That's a bomb dot.
[120:16.61]You can take out all nearby enemies and obstacles.
[120:44.45]I missed it.
[120:45.07]Sorry.
[121:23.00]Excuse me?
[121:23.76]How did I not get that?
[121:28.76]Oh my god.
[121:38.25]That just got way harder for no reason.
[122:17.35]Alright, what song is this?
[122:44.86]Who's my favorite character?
[122:45.82]Grandpa Pac-Man for sure.
[122:54.40]King Kallaxian.
[122:56.77]That's a G. What am I supposed to do about this?
[123:08.23]What did he dodge that?
[123:41.48]Ooh, good placement.
[124:09.14]Oh, I had, um... I had Checkers or Rallies.
[124:13.22]I want to give you a review on it.
[124:14.88]I forgot about that.
[124:15.44]I want to give you a review about how I feel about Rallies.
[124:17.40]Remember how I never had it before?
[124:21.11]I had it.
[124:22.39]I had Rallies.
[124:23.95]Let me tell you something.
[124:24.91]Very important.
[124:27.63]Um... Is it Rallies?
[124:30.31]Rallies?
[124:30.77]Is Checkers Rallies?
[124:34.49]Rallies?
[124:35.09]Rallies?
[124:35.51]I don't know how you say it.
[124:41.18]I'll tell you after.
[124:41.70]Okay.
[124:42.04]But yeah, I had it.
[124:46.43]During my tier list, my fast food tier list stream, people were like, you've never had checkers before?
[124:50.83]You've never had rallies before?
[124:52.19]How is that possible?
[124:52.93]And I was like, I never had it.
[124:54.43]And I said, if I ever have it, I'll update you.
[124:56.86]And I had it, so I just thought, well, shit, I need to update you guys.
[125:01.88]And I have a couple of very strong opinions on it.
[125:04.66]I think I'm going to confuse a lot of you, maybe.
[125:12.39]We don't care.
[125:20.76]We don't care.
[125:22.77]Whatever.
[125:23.17]I mean, I just want to let you know.
[125:27.39]Dude, we don't care.
[125:29.15]No, I don't care.
[125:30.00]Really?
[125:30.48]Okay.
[125:31.52]Run a poll in the chat right now.
[125:34.20]Oh, whatever.
[125:35.66]The streamer's going off on a story or a tangent.
[125:38.92]I want to hear it.
[125:39.44]No, no, no.
[125:40.08]Truly tell me the truth.
[125:41.78]Yes or no.
[125:43.18]Do you give a shit about that I've eaten at rallies?
[125:46.39]And be very honest.
[125:48.15]Take away the fact that, like, oh, you're here and hanging out.
[125:50.95]Do you actually give a shit about what I'm about to say at all?
[125:54.37]And I mean truly be like, nah, I really don't give a fuck.
[125:56.93]I want to know.
[126:00.67]If at least 40% of you do not give a shit about this, I won't talk about it.
[126:05.37]And I'm very curious.
[126:07.45]It's R-A-L-L-Y.
[126:12.00]I want to see just how many people don't care.
[126:14.36]That's so funny to me.
[126:28.79]God damn it!
[126:31.33]Yep.
[126:32.45]Yeah, R-A-L-L-Y-S.
[126:36.17]I have no patience at all.
[126:37.27]Alright, what does it say?
[126:46.60]How do you guys feel?
[126:50.91]Whoa.
[126:51.59]Okay.
[126:52.01]It's a lot so far.
[126:52.85]That's a very, that's a big initial one.
[126:55.54]Where 39% say, no, I don't care.
[127:11.63]Okay, stop.
[127:14.29]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[127:19.16]Okay, it's this one right after.
[127:20.64]God damn it!
[127:23.98]They're the same shape!
[127:36.19]Alright, we're at 37%.
[127:36.75]That means enough of you care, so I'm gonna do it.
[127:50.53]36%.
[127:50.57]Yeah, I told you you have to get over 40%.
[127:53.07]So where's the next area?
[127:58.47]Did I do it all?
[128:04.50]Is there a next area?
[128:06.30]How do I get there?
[128:10.82]Alright, that's it.
[128:11.80]I'm going to talk about it.
[128:12.48]Okay.
[128:17.81]Alright.
[128:18.45]You've spoken.
[128:18.75]You've spoken.
[128:22.47]The Rally's french fries are the best fast food french fries I've ever had in my entire life.
[128:33.12]In my entire life.
[128:34.98]They are the most un-fucking-believable french fries.
[128:39.00]They are unbelievably good.
[128:41.38]It is so mind-boggling how they could be that good.
[128:43.88]They're that good.
[128:44.64]They're unbelievable.
[128:46.15]Everything else is dog shit.
[128:47.31]The whole fucking rest of the whole restaurant.
[128:58.87]Alright, the chicken strips were okay.
[129:00.82]They were fine.
[129:02.94]But everything else, I was like, this is kind of not good.
[129:07.40]But I'm telling you right now, I would go to rallies and just get french fries and get a bunch of sauces and shit.
[129:18.67]It's worth going to rallies just to get the french fries and shit.
[129:21.73]Just get a three large french fry orders and split it with like two people.
[129:24.98]Three people.
[129:32.17]How bad were the other food items?
[129:34.49]They were... They were just... Okay.
[129:36.69]It was like... Okay, dog shit was probably rude.
[129:40.89]But... The chicken fingers were just... They didn't really taste like anything.
[129:46.01]It was just... They were very, like, five or six out of ten.
[129:51.07]Literally dog shit.
[129:53.19]They were literally dog shit.
[129:54.71]Although they were five out of ten.
[129:55.97]Um...
[130:01.33]You got chicken at a burger joint.
[130:02.77]I got a burger, too, and it was okay.
[130:04.83]It was, like, fine.
[130:07.19]Every other burger I've had from any other fast food place was better.
[130:10.48]It was fine.
[130:11.36]But let me tell you, the french fries are so good that I want them so bad.
[130:19.99]So badly right now.
[130:24.71]They are so crunchy and crispy, and they're just perfect.
[130:28.28]They're always perfectly hot.
[130:30.54]It tastes like they came right out of an oven.
[130:32.66]And they're like... They're so unbelievably good.
[130:35.76]I can't even... I could not tell you how good they are.
[130:42.81]You can buy them at the store.
[130:45.03]Oh, that would be amazing.
[130:46.35]They sell the frozen version.
[130:49.63]I don't know what they're doing to those fries, but...
[130:52.90]Okay, everything else is like a 4 or 5 out of 10, but the fries being that good makes that like a C or a B tier place that I would go to.
[130:59.88]If I were to put rallies on that tier list, it'd be probably low B. Only because I would order french fries and maybe like something else, but just get mainly french fries.
[131:11.02]It's literally a B for sure because of that.
[131:14.70]You have to have them.
[131:16.14]If you're like, dude, what the fuck is this fast food french fries?
[131:18.27]Just eat them once and you'll be like, well, my life is forever different.
[131:24.91]Where's the next area?
[131:26.41]Did I not complete enough stuff?
[131:35.23]What's this?
[131:43.40]Dude, I regret it.
[131:44.32]I should have said I don't care.
[131:45.78]Oh, here we go.
[131:52.60]2-1.
[132:05.32]oh that looks cool I love McDonald's fries but they can just they can be very bad I have had McDonald's Burger King Wendy's fries before that would just
[132:25.55]Just sad.
[132:27.37]And you just don't even really want them.
[132:28.93]They're just not good.
[132:35.13]Can I get up there?
[132:49.49]Our eyes are inconsistent.
[132:51.65]Yeah.
[132:54.57]I was actually going to make a tweet about it.
[132:58.06]I was going to do a tweet where I took a bite out of one of the french fries and was just going to be like, look, guys, listen to this crunch.
[133:03.79]And that was going to be the whole video.
[133:06.65]And it was going to be like, oh, like, Raleigh's.
[133:09.79]Listen to this.
[133:10.27]And I was like, that's a fucking weird video.
[133:13.12]So I just didn't make it.
[133:27.08]McDonald's double cheeseburgers are... Yeah, it's just... I know a lot of people say, dude, McDonald's is so bad.
[133:34.97]Why do you have the palate of a five-year-old?
[133:39.49]Something about it.
[133:41.26]Somebody just said the double cheeseburger from McDonald's is unmatched from any place I've had.
[133:46.92]It just is.
[133:48.88]And it's not that it's the best quality hamburger I've ever had.
[133:53.13]It just tastes good.
[133:55.19]It's just good every time I've ever had it.
[133:58.51]Child paladin.
[134:02.19]Well, I didn't tell you about the fucking salmon that I like.
[134:04.05]Kids don't like salmon.
[134:07.33]I can't name you a five-year-old that's like, oh, yeah, fresh salmon.
[134:10.69]Can I have some?
[134:12.45]Sorry.
[134:27.92]Oh, I can't hurt the ghost, whatever.
[134:40.58]Kids will eat anything.
[134:43.28]I don't know how many young... How many kids have you ever talked to?
[134:50.28]Kids do not eat anything?
[134:51.58]Huh?
[134:58.83]When I was a kid, I didn't just eat anything.
[135:00.59]I had Captain Crunch for dinner half the time, because I told you that story, how I would be like, I want Captain Crunch for dinner!
[135:07.87]And my mother would be like, oh, okay, yeah, you can have Captain Crunch for dinner, but you've got it.
[135:13.10]You can have it, but you have to eat dinner first.
[135:17.18]So I would be like, oh my God, I can't believe it.
[135:21.34]I get to eat Captain Crunch whenever I want.
[135:23.37]So my mother would, I would eat all my dinner and be like, I can't wait to eat Captain Crunch for dinner.
[135:28.49]And she would give me this little, like it had to have been 10 pellets.
[135:36.09]It had to have been 10 pellets.
[135:40.70]Total.
[135:41.54]What I would get after dinner.
[135:43.52]And I thought I was a scammer.
[135:46.70]I was like, yep.
[135:48.60]So I just have to eat my dinner and I can eat Captain Crunch for dinner?
[135:52.09]I am the most intelligent kid in the world.
[135:55.83]And she was giving me the equivalent of like two spoonfuls of shit.
[136:01.49]And I thought I was the smart one.
[136:09.09]Ow.
[136:19.01]I need whiz metal.
[136:20.43]No?
[136:28.31]That's just dessert.
[136:29.21]Yeah, but in my five-year-old of six-whatever-year-old brain, whatever it was.
[136:38.14]It's the same story with the... What the hell?
[136:42.57]Okay, we're good.
[136:48.31]Missing the... A, but whatever.
[136:59.04]It's the same story with the... If his arm stays up, he's asleep.
[137:04.55]I've told that many times.
[137:06.81]But there's probably a lot of new people on the channel.
[137:08.87]Maybe should I tell it again?
[137:16.33]Okay, so when me and my siblings were younger, again, we thought we were the smartest people in the room.
[137:23.59]You know, when you're a kid and you're supposed to be asleep in bed.
[137:27.80]You're supposed to be asleep, it's bedtime.
[137:29.44]And, no, I'm staying up and I'm going to talk and do stuff.
[137:34.26]And then, you know, you hear, here comes mom or dad to see, like, what's going on in here?
[137:40.90]And, you know, you don't want to get in trouble.
[137:43.70]No, no, I'm asleep, I'm asleep.
[137:46.04]So it's like you put your head down and I'm asleep.
[137:48.65]I'm definitely sleeping.
[137:49.49]I was not talking.
[137:50.65]We were not messing around and having fun in here, right?
[137:53.60]I was not having any fun in here.
[137:56.73]and then they would come over and my mother and my father would say oh really interesting okay they look asleep yeah I think they're asleep there's really one foolproof way to know if somebody's truly sleeping and they would come and take your arm and they would just lift it up and hold it and they would say well I mean if his arm stays up he's asleep and I would be sitting there going like this and in my brain going yup gotcha motherfucker that's me asleep
[138:28.02]And then they'd go, oh, oh, okay.
[138:31.04]Very asleep.
[138:31.84]Oh, really?
[138:32.46]Asleep, asleep.
[138:33.26]Okay, that's okay.
[138:34.26]So I wasn't having any fun in here.
[138:37.53]And I thought I was so smart.
[138:39.37]And then eventually, eventually I caught on and I did this soccer flop, right?
[138:46.94]So instead of going like this and holding it up, oh, if his arm stays up, he's asleep.
[138:50.02]Oh, okay.
[138:51.68]It turned into this.
[138:54.96]Like, no way, I'm not falling for that one.
[138:57.60]So exaggerated that I just flop it.
[139:01.70]And the same thing would happen.
[139:05.18]You were a stupid fucking kid.
[139:08.61]Aren't we all, though?
[139:12.29]He did this when he was 22.
[139:13.91]I was a real smart kid.
[139:31.76]I was smart.
[139:32.54]No, you think you were smart.
[139:37.08]You were shoving crayons up your nose like everybody else was.
[139:40.53]Come on.
[139:40.97]I don't have banana.
[139:55.47]Oh shit, it's right there.
[140:13.03]Get up there.
[140:13.51]Did I lose my opportunity to do this?
[140:15.57]Oh shit.
[140:31.55]Were you a glue eater?
[140:32.55]No.
[140:34.03]I actually wasn't.
[140:40.51]What's the 2 for?
[140:50.09]I don't know.
[140:57.13]No?
[141:00.98]This is so annoying.
[141:01.72]I actually can't get that.
[141:07.60]Oh, yes I can.
[141:08.10]I'm just stupid.
[141:26.14]Alright, what's this do?
[141:31.45]Oh.
[141:36.35]Ollie gives Jerma 10 pellets of Captain Crunch after he finishes all his hamburger helper.
[141:41.54]This stuff is so fucking good.
[141:44.22]Oh, man.
[141:44.80]You just made me think of hamburger helper.
[141:46.52]What a bunch of junk.
[141:49.50]What a bunch of fucking junk.
[141:51.36]But it is the best shit in the world.
[142:03.97]It's gross.
[142:04.61]No, it's not.
[142:05.39]Don't.
[142:05.75]Stop.
[142:08.12]Look, something can be weirdly unappetizing, but still be one of the best things you've ever eaten.
[142:12.92]Stop.
[142:13.50]Come on.
[142:16.49]I know it's gross.
[142:19.11]Okay, maybe it is a little gross, but it's still delicious.
[142:35.38]It's just so yummy.
[142:41.64]food snobs.
[142:44.64]Um, yeah, I mean, I get it.
[142:46.40]I get it.
[142:47.72]It's kind of filthy looking.
[142:49.64]It kind of looks like somebody like puked into a pan.
[142:57.00]There is that period where you are making Hamburger Helper, and it's at that gross phase where it's not really combined all the way, and it just looks like somebody threw up into your saucepan.
[143:07.77]And you're sitting there thinking, ugh, I hope this thickens up.
[143:12.07]This is, like, fucking awful.
[143:14.09]It happens every time.
[143:15.93]Every single time I've ever made Hamburger Helper, I've said the same thing.
[143:20.57]I do like The Sims shit.
[143:22.11]I'm sitting there cooking, and I go, ugh, yuck.
[143:30.09]And then when it's done, I eat it.
[143:33.26]And it's actually very good.
[143:34.72]I'm very happy though.
[143:35.74]Get them all, get them all, get them all, get them all!
[143:39.28]Yay!
[144:02.02]It's perfect slop food.
[144:03.52]That's the best way to describe it.
[144:07.36]It's so weird because doesn't Hamburger Helper have as many flavors as Gatorade does?
[144:12.57]There's like 15 different boxes, isn't there?
[144:18.59]There's so many different kinds.
[144:28.88]Variety?
[144:29.36]Yeah.
[144:33.67]You know what else is really good about Hamburger Helper?
[144:35.37]It'll feed you for a long time.
[144:40.57]It's filling.
[144:41.73]It'll keep you full for a while.
[144:43.47]And you can put that in the fridge and keep it there and just heat it up.
[144:58.46]Imagine it with chicken and not hamburger.
[145:02.23]There is absolutely probably a bunch of TikTok videos of hamburger helper hacks that are all what you are describing.
[145:12.11]I don't think you have to look very far.
[145:17.92]Is there a chicken helper?
[145:31.37]See, that to me would be kind of strange.
[145:33.43]Chicken's a little different.
[145:34.57]How would you... What do you... Chicken helper.
[145:38.23]I don't get it.
[145:38.61]Because the whole thing with hamburger helper is it's ground beef.
[145:42.22]So you just brown it in the pan and then add, you know, drain it.
[145:45.68]How do you... You just dump it in with a bunch of chicken patty strips or something?
[145:50.84]Is it ground chicken?
[145:53.67]Shredded chicken.
[145:58.14]this tuna helper.
[145:59.16]Dude, I could go for a big fucking egg salad right now.
[146:06.32]I make a great egg salad.
[146:09.57]I make probably the best- I'm not- I'm trying to be very clear here.
[146:12.89]I make the best egg salad you've ever had in your life.
[146:16.11]I mean it.
[146:19.32]If I sold my egg salad, I'd be a fucking trillionaire.
[146:23.16]I would.
[146:23.76]It would be a story.
[146:25.72]Like, oh yeah, I now own and operate like 50 restaurants where all we have is a bunch of egg salad.
[146:31.23]That's like what we do.
[146:34.77]Imagine the main menu item on your restaurant is an egg salad.
[146:40.91]You guys don't have prime rib?
[146:42.79]No, not at all.
[146:44.27]Oh, do you have any like seared chicken or any, you know, tuna?
[146:48.19]No, nothing.
[146:48.69]We have egg salad sandwiches.
[146:50.41]That's it.
[146:50.83]But then we'll do what you're good at.
[146:56.05]I'm telling you, I make my egg salad and you're going to fucking freak out.
[146:59.41]Why am I acting so weird?
[147:00.49]I don't know.
[147:05.89]Literally show me how you make it.
[147:07.18]It's a secret.
[147:09.28]It's an actual secret recipe.
[147:21.31]The secret recipe.
[147:32.06]The secret is... it's something else you add to it.
[147:35.52]It's a secret recipe, I'm not gonna give it to you.
[147:38.54]I have to be able to pass something down to my kids that's not watch me eat boogers on stream.
[147:44.14]know what I mean like there has to be something else oh yeah what did grandpa pass down oh he was a weirdo online that's pretty much it no he left behind his secret grandpa left his I'm gonna write it I'm gonna write it down on lined paper and leave it out and make sure it's old and shitty looking in 50 years make sure it's all stained and stuff so they can get it but whoa boy this is grandpa's secret egg salad recipe so I can leave something
[148:26.20]2-1, whiz 2-2.
[148:27.01]Oh, here we go.
[148:34.26]It's not a secret, it's paprika.
[148:37.36]I don't put paprika in my egg salad.
[148:40.17]And what an amateur move that would be, by the way.
[148:52.97]He puts hot sauce in it.
[148:54.65]Huh?
[148:55.01]Okay.
[148:57.81]Oh, he puts hot sauce in it.
[148:58.97]Yeah, that's what it is.
[148:59.89]That's the secret recipe.
[149:07.56]Damn, that looks like it hurt.
[149:10.70]No, I'm not going to tell you because I need to leave a note for my grandkids.
[149:14.83]This is all I'm going to have.
[149:15.85]This is it.
[149:19.58]If I say it right now, then it's over.
[149:22.62]And I can't write it down on a piece of lined paper and burn it.
[149:26.58]I'm going to take a lighter and light it on fire.
[149:29.60]Burn it.
[149:30.10]Put it out.
[149:30.36]Put it out.
[149:30.94]Light it on fire.
[149:31.38]Burn it.
[149:31.70]Put it out.
[149:32.78]So it's this old document that they have to find.
[149:47.30]Throw it in a fireplace.
[149:48.50]Yeah, like, put it in a fireplace, and then, like, get it out, blow it out, blow it out, and make sure it's all old and fucked up.
[149:57.07]And right on it, Grandpa's award-winning egg salad.
[150:02.03]Secret.
[150:06.88]And, hey bro, roll up a few hundreds.
[150:10.18]You know what I mean?
[150:10.72]Roll up, like, ten hundreds.
[150:12.66]And, like, roll it up together.
[150:14.00]So it's like, holy shit, we found this.
[150:15.43]We found this shit.
[150:16.45]Grandpa rolled up ten hundreds.
[150:18.37]You thought you were just getting egg salad?
[150:24.20]No, you're getting, like, five grand in cash, too.
[150:26.90]At least.
[150:40.28]What if they watch this VOD?
[150:41.42]Well, I'm not going to say the recipe.
[150:43.06]That's the point.
[150:46.60]Oh, I think I screwed it up.
[150:48.98]Can I get back up again?
[150:49.89]Alright, hold on.
[150:57.33]What if the paper got destroyed?
[151:02.73]Then I'm so... I don't... You know, maybe I should mess up the text a little bit.
[151:07.13]So you have to actually decipher it.
[151:15.65]I actually want to do this, so I gotta get the plane.
[151:24.00]You really want to get weird here?
[151:25.38]Yeah.
[151:27.34]There will be, so you guys right now, my great, great, great, great grandchildren will be able to watch this stream and potentially see what you're writing.
[151:42.60]Do you understand how fucking strange that is?
[151:44.58]Do you understand how just bizarre that is?
[151:48.94]We always look at photos of old stuff.
[151:50.94]And it's just a picture of your great-great-grandfather.
[151:55.21]Like that.
[151:57.59]And that's it.
[151:58.73]And oh, he was a... He worked at a... He was a... He was a blacksmith or something, right?
[152:07.87]Every booger eating comment I've made, my great great great great grandkids will be able to see it.
[152:15.29]So this is where it starts.
[152:17.78]My kids.
[152:18.80]It's your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
[152:21.66]What I have done is I have buried secret family treasure somewhere.
[152:27.87]And you are going to start your journey right now.
[152:30.91]In the attic, there is a piece of paper.
[152:33.97]On that piece of paper is a note with some instructions on it.
[152:38.36]And I'm going to tell you, the one hint you'll get here... Dull.
[152:47.00]Dull.
[152:50.02]And I'm going to put it in a fucking doll or something.
[152:52.26]And that's how they can start.
[152:56.62]Doll.
[153:00.30]And then they're going to go on an adventure.
[153:01.58]You spoiling it in the VOD.
[153:21.27]Well, no, no, no.
[153:22.16]What we'll do is... We'll clip that section and then I'll delete the VOD.
[153:28.80]Right?
[153:31.42]I'm just losing.
[153:32.60]I'm not even paying attention.
[153:38.32]How cool would that be, though?
[153:39.43]Can you imagine?
[153:40.29]I'm going to do it.
[153:41.47]You guys think I'm screwing around?
[153:42.61]I'm going to do this.
[153:44.61]I am going to make it.
[153:46.89]I'm going to do a big treasure hunt thing for my great-great-great-grandkids.
[153:52.59]You know the equivalent of when, okay, imagine the old photo.
[153:55.97]Right now, your great-great-great-grandmother or something.
[153:58.83]It was like, like on the back, you turn it over and it's, the secret is in the doll.
[154:05.66]And then you remember, oh, wait.
[154:08.50]Great-great-grandma, the doll that's up in the attic.
[154:12.16]What does that mean?
[154:13.00]And they like take it apart or something.
[154:14.46]Oh, there's a map in here.
[154:17.30]That's what I'm doing for my grandkids right now.
[154:21.01]So just wait, just wait another like 400 to 500 years and they'll figure it out.
[154:26.89]And it's going to be so cool.
[154:27.81]And I'm going to go on, there's going to be a news article about it.
[154:30.01]It's going to be awesome.
[154:34.68]It'll be like, oh, it'll be like on Reddit.
[154:37.56]I found an old buried stream post from my great, great, great grandfather.
[154:42.28]He put us on a treasure hunt.
[154:48.73]Old, yeah, old school, like, subreddit, right?
[154:55.63]And then, when they get to the treasure, like, I say I'm gonna do all this, like, oh, wait, wait, there's a secret family recipe.
[154:59.85]No.
[155:00.53]It's just me, like, smoking crack, you know, like a Polaroid.
[155:03.78]And that's all it is.
[155:07.54]And then, oh, they're gonna be, they're gonna feel real bad about writing those articles.
[155:12.42]Okay.
[155:41.67]What if you don't have grandkids?
[155:46.17]I don't know.
[155:47.23]Then just delete this because then I'll... I don't know.
[155:52.78]Why would anybody have left... By the way, if you want to give me shit for that, why did anyone leave a secret fucking family treasure recipe for anybody?
[156:02.45]No, no, I'm not going to leave the treasure hunt.
[156:04.35]What if I don't have grandkids?
[156:06.61]At that point, I would have known, right?
[156:12.85]If you're that old and you don't have grand, of course it's not going to happen.
[156:17.03]I can give it to somebody else.
[156:17.79]Remember, you don't have to leave family treasure hunts.
[156:28.84]So?
[156:33.64]Write the clues in the library books.
[156:45.15]Yeah, let grandpa have his... Yeah, what do you mean?
[156:47.73]Oh, why?
[156:49.07]Who cares?
[156:49.81]Why wouldn't you?
[156:50.67]If you wanted to.
[156:54.53]By the way, grandkids.
[156:56.85]B. The letter B. Look for it.
[156:59.84]I may have wrote it on the ceiling in the bathroom.
[157:02.02]And underneath that fucking ceiling tile, it could be the next step in your journey.
[157:07.78]Look for the letter B somewhere.
[157:10.26]Right?
[157:22.90]Where do I go?
[157:34.53]Where do I actually go?
[157:35.47]Oh.
[157:46.64]Why would they watch this VOD?
[157:49.42]How would it be a secret treasure hunt if I made it easy?
[157:52.78]There's thousands of pieces of media that I've been in.
[157:55.76]Do you want me to make it easy?
[158:00.32]How would it be a secret family treasure hunt?
[158:26.25]Jerma's trying to give his ancestors a lot of leeway if he's expecting a random ceiling tile not to be replaced in 400 years.
[158:33.20]Dude, that house probably won't even exist.
[158:40.36]They're probably just, like, bulldozing.
[158:47.37]Well, how did anybody leave anything like that, right?
[158:49.65]Do I just have to bury it somewhere?
[158:51.33]How would that even work?
[158:57.17]Yeah.
[158:57.51]How did anybody find anything secret?
[159:01.17]I'm dead.
[159:14.03]This doesn't happen in real life, dude.
[159:18.51]Hasn't it once?
[159:19.31]It has, yeah.
[159:27.94]It has.
[159:32.92]Yes, it does.
[159:33.96]Yes, it does.
[159:34.62]Yeah, so what the hell?
[159:35.72]Yeah, I can make it happen.
[159:59.81]I know I'm going to probably jump on those, right?
[160:01.29]One of these I'm going to have to jump on top of.
[160:19.40]Your grandkids are going to see a really enlarged picture of your ass.
[160:26.00]Yeah, I know.
[160:27.58]Why do you think I'm trying to figure out food stuff to leave them?
[160:30.74]They're going to take one bite of the egg salad and go, wow, this is actually on par with that ass photo.
[160:40.97]I'm so glad he left it for us.
[160:49.41]Wait, that's a key.
[161:05.20]There's probably somebody trapped here.
[161:11.88]I jumped over that.
[161:29.50]Oh, it's the dog.
[161:30.50]That was a triple right there.
[161:31.76]Adjusted for inflation, you're going to give him like $3.
[161:34.69]I'll do the math and shit.
[161:35.87]I'll calculate it.
[161:36.49]Let me out.
[162:00.78]So in like a thousand years or something, they find it.
[162:03.98]What did I say I was going to do?
[162:04.98]Five grand?
[162:06.38]I'll put like, I don't know, I'll put like 500 grand in there.
[162:09.19]Well, no, I can't do that.
[162:10.03]Uh, no, never mind.
[162:28.41]No, no, how about this?
[162:31.11]The only way you can get the money is there's, I don't know, there's a code attached to it that you can only know if you, if you like spread my recipe on whatever TikTok of that time is.
[162:41.75]I gotta, I gotta figure out a way to make it so like you gotta, I've, you, I've gotta be popular.
[162:47.66]I've got my recipe is going to be popular.
[162:49.72]It's going to be a huge deal.
[162:51.80]And like only then when this exact account that by the way, I made an account on on TikTok and this account, here's the username and password.
[163:00.68]This account must get five to ten, at least 5000 likes on a egg salad video of my recipe or it will not unlock.
[163:14.69]That's kind of fun.
[163:26.21]And the first thing, it'll be me in a video with a suit on.
[163:28.49]Like, oh, you found it.
[163:32.64]You know how they always do that?
[163:33.94]Like, the rich asshole is here recording a video, and let me tell you.
[163:37.68]Oh, so you found it.
[163:40.58]What you need to do is you need to make sure that you... Yeah, I'll do a whole spiel.
[163:58.72]Did I miss something over here?
[164:12.51]He's a goose laying his own eggs?
[164:14.33]What does that mean?
[164:15.10]What's that?
[164:15.38]What's that?
[164:15.72]What's that mean?
[164:18.46]There's going to be a sentient AI of you by then.
[164:20.66]Not if I have a no sentient AI clause.
[164:24.72]Not if I make sure to tell my lawyers that under no circumstances am I going to be a sentient AI and we all sign it and it's fucking, you can't do it.
[164:34.09]Not if I put it in a clause somewhere.
[164:47.71]I'll do it illegally.
[164:48.63]But you're going to have to answer to the estate because I put it in a contract.
[164:55.94]I like the fact that you're asking for clout even after you're dead.
[165:04.02]No, I don't want the clout.
[165:05.44]I want my recipe to have the clout.
[165:15.63]Your consciousness is going to be free by then.
[165:21.04]No, it's not.
[165:24.23]Yeah, I only want my recipe to have clout, not me.
[165:51.06]Your consciousness is going to eventually enter public domain.
[165:56.84]Bro, I have not had enough beer to talk- I have not smoked enough fucking weed to have this conversation.
[166:01.61]Because what you just said is crazy.
[166:03.29]And actually, somehow makes bizarre sense.
[166:20.28]Shit, this is a perfect run.
[166:47.96]Stop talking about drugs.
[166:48.95]My daughter watches you.
[166:55.45]A mature audience warning with this room.
[167:02.69]Is this game pretty poggers?
[167:05.66]It's it's alright.
[167:06.30]I think it's fun.
[167:08.50]It's difficult.
[167:09.02]This would be a great game to sit down and play.
[167:13.02]With your grandchildren.
[167:15.72]Hey, grandkids, how are you?
[167:17.34]It's me, Jeremy, again.
[167:19.36]Grandpa Jeremy.
[167:21.92]I heard you found the note that I left you.
[167:23.66]Let me tell you something.
[167:29.22]Hold on, I don't want to lose.
[167:33.53]Why would it be in the same VOD?
[167:34.77]That's not fair.
[167:35.63]Okay, remind me in like five years to do this again.
[167:38.59]Because they need the second half of the code.
[167:43.81]What's happening here?
[167:53.63]Does it work?
[167:58.43]What's going on?
[168:10.48]Wait, what?
[168:11.16]Was I supposed to lose?
[168:19.10]Oh, I already saw this cutscene.
[168:20.36]Wow.
[168:21.72]I was not paying any attention.
[168:26.94]Hey.
[168:29.72]OK, alright, right, so they're all they're all yellow now.
[168:32.52]Now what?
[168:45.87]Oh, OK.
[168:49.06]I get it.
[168:51.80]I get it.
[168:52.96]I was supposed to when I accidentally .
[168:56.43]I was supposed to do it the other way.
[168:58.65]No, not as hard.
[169:32.01]This music sounds like Dungeons & Dragons.
[169:47.45]Oh, not as hard.
[169:50.33]Why are they still people here?
[170:04.56]Stop!
[170:11.54]Oh my god.
[170:13.16]Okay, this is just annoying.
[170:18.94]Everyone's a hate watcher.
[170:38.43]Oh my god!
[170:40.63]You'd be a great politician because you have no soul.
[170:47.38]Whoa.
[170:48.98]Whoa, man.
[170:52.50]You need to relax.
[171:20.39]Oh, you want something insane?
[171:21.43]Okay, so... Last night... Oh, please.
[171:26.73]Last night or the night before... I had... Ten dreams in a row.
[171:33.78]And Holly was next to me.
[171:36.24]And I kept on being in a dream.
[171:40.00]I would go to bed.
[171:40.76]She would hear me go... Hmm...
[171:47.47]And she'd go, hey, hey.
[171:48.75]And I'd go, and it happened like 10 fucking times in a row.
[171:53.05]I was stun locked in a dream.
[171:54.27]It was ridiculous.
[171:55.21]It was so bad.
[171:55.89]Because you know, anytime you dream and you wake up from a dream and you go back and you have a second dream right after, immediately after, it usually stops.
[172:04.68]After the second, third, and fourth time of that happening, you sit there in this weird panicked mode where you go, oh my God, I don't want to go back to bed.
[172:13.08]Is it just going to happen again?
[172:14.72]Why am I a dog?
[172:17.48]They always do that.
[172:27.24]They always go...
[172:50.32]But no, and so one of the times, I'll tell you, it was so strange.
[172:54.51]After the fourth or fifth time, and they were such small, short dreams that made no sense.
[173:00.64]I remember one of them.
[173:02.32]Remember, I had to try to remember five to ten of these in a row.
[173:06.17]One of them where it was... I was in the hallway where the bedroom is over here.
[173:10.97]I was in the hallway and I went into the... I opened up the bedroom door and it was like... But there was no bed in there.
[173:20.80]It was empty.
[173:23.08]But in the room instead...
[173:25.78]was just an empty room with no bed, and in a line facing the other way, one, two, three, four, and then another line, one, two, three, four, looking this way, were just these people in, they had white hair and these black capes, just black cloaks, all standing and staring away from the door.
[173:49.50]It was just strange.
[173:52.20]One of the other times, so eventually, I know, who fucking cares if I'm losing in this game?
[173:56.43]Do you really care?
[173:58.43]When I woke up one of the last times, because Holly had been waking me up over and over again.
[174:05.91]And again, boom!
[174:07.69]I fall asleep, I wake up.
[174:09.77]Well, wake up in the dream, essentially.
[174:11.49]So I fall asleep, and there I am in that same area, away from the bedroom.
[174:17.42]And I was maybe ten feet away from the bedroom door again.
[174:21.74]But this time I knew that Holly was going to wake me up, but I was sitting there going...
[174:26.13]Oh shit!
[174:27.89]No, I'm too far away.
[174:28.97]I'm not in the bedroom.
[174:30.10]I won't hear her wake me up.
[174:32.48]Next to me.
[174:33.74]I'm too far away.
[174:34.60]I can't- I won't be able to hear her.
[174:35.90]It was horrifying.
[174:42.39]Were you on psychedelics?
[174:43.47]No.
[174:59.19]What is he talking about?
[175:00.21]I'm talking about a dream, dude.
[175:13.54]And apparently every time I was just doing the... Just breathing.
[175:21.88]Just...
[175:38.99]Did you eat before bed?
[175:39.89]I think... I mean, I usually don't eat that close to bed.
[175:52.05]Dogs are so funny, though.
[175:54.71]I don't get it.
[175:56.09]I know that they're just built so... I can't beat this because I don't... Alright, listen to me.
[176:01.73]Why don't I just pause the game?
[176:05.55]Uh, so Otto will put his head down.
[176:09.12]Okay, it's time for bed.
[176:11.54]Oh, yeah, he gets comfortable.
[176:13.38]Asleep.
[176:16.06]I wish I had that ability.
[176:18.48]Dogs can just go right to sleep in a deep, grim sleep immediately.
[176:25.05]I envy it so much.
[176:36.20]I'm not going to lose this again.
[176:39.05]It's embarrassing if I don't beat this now.
[176:58.82]You are so bad at aiming, Pac-Man.
[177:19.87]Alright, here we go.
[177:20.85]The whole base is itchy.
[177:32.62]Where do I go for that?
[177:33.80]I don't know.
[177:46.89]I don't know.
[178:06.46]Alright, last one.
[179:01.40]Take a booger snack break.
[179:04.84]This is it.
[179:05.22]It's going to be so huge in like a few days and I'm pissed about it.
[179:11.98]From the umpire master.
[179:16.83]Okay.
[179:54.38]Would you rather fight this boss or the Nameless King?
[179:58.46]When is the Elden Ring DLC?
[180:00.90]Are we going to get any?
[180:01.78]What do you think?
[180:11.58]That was a huge burp and I'm so glad that you heard it.
[180:23.53]There 100% will be.
[180:25.03]I saw this thing where people said the time frame between when the other FromSoftware games came out and when DLC came out, we're pretty much at that point.
[180:35.63]Where after about 10 months or so, right, is when we should think about maybe getting an announcement.
[180:42.15]Depends on how big it is.
[180:42.96]Maybe it takes more time to do this one.
[180:48.82]Excuse me.
[180:49.62]Give me a break.
[180:50.48]Pay attention.
[180:54.25]Please have health on you.
[180:58.57]What the fuck?
[181:13.22]What?
[181:13.84]What?
[181:14.04]I'm alive.
[181:14.56]What?
[181:14.86]How am I alive?
[181:15.40]What happened?
[181:16.16]What the fuck just happened?
[181:16.98]Why am I alive?
[181:17.56]I had no health.
[181:19.32]I'm fucking dead now.
[181:41.65]How are you supposed to avoid getting hit by that?
[181:45.40]Do I have to hold this?
[181:46.14]I don't know how you avoid that.
[181:50.40]I have to dash?
[181:59.19]There's no area to dash.
[182:00.91]Why is this guy so much harder than the whole rest of the entire video game?
[182:03.87]I only have eight lives left.
[182:21.65]Do I have to run towards it?
[182:22.89]I don't know.
[182:32.20]How the fuck did you beat Malenia?
[182:39.28]Do you think I'm paying that much attention to the Pac-Man game?
[182:43.08]Because I am a good player in Dark Souls games.
[182:47.74]It doesn't necessarily translate to a Pac-Man remake game that, like, we're just talking about, like, we're talking about my descendants and me eating boogers and stuff.
[182:59.14]I'm not locked in playing against Malenia.
[183:03.77]You can call that coping if you want, but I beat Millenia.
[183:07.67]So, I'm sorry.
[183:08.99]You cannot say that I'm a bad gamer because that exists.
[183:13.47]I'm having a bad day, okay?
[183:15.16]I'm having a bad day.
[183:16.68]I have my gamer license.
[183:17.98]I don't need to renew it right now.
[183:19.88]I don't need to renew it at Pac-Man World Remake.
[183:25.54]My license is not up for renewal yet.
[183:29.39]I don't have to do that.
[183:43.49]It's not remake, it's repack.
[183:48.77]Alright.
[184:02.64]I just have to beat it before he does that again, like a few more times.
[184:29.08]What the fuck?
[184:30.20]It's broken.
[184:30.86]No!
[184:30.92]What the fuck?
[184:55.01]I keep missing it.
[185:13.97]Good thing you slept mid-fight pretending to be a dog.
[185:19.44]I didn't do that when I played against Malenia.
[185:21.16]There you go, there's your difference.
[185:24.78]I wasn't pretending to sleep like a dog when I was very focused.
[185:59.85]Hey, what if you wore roller skates and got pushed down a hill?
[186:13.16]Like in an old Jerry Lewis movie?
[186:19.55]You mean, I don't know how to roller skate.
[186:22.14]Whoa!
[186:26.12]And it's a bunch of comedy where I'm going really fast and all.
[186:31.14]I block my eyes because I'm about to hit a truck and then I go under the truck.
[186:35.59]And I go, huh, huh, huh.
[186:37.81]Baby carriage.
[186:39.01]Baby carriage and mom.
[186:41.01]Oh!
[186:41.45]And then I go, I hit the baby carriage and boom, I get the baby in my arms.
[186:46.52]Oh my God.
[186:47.44]And then I make it to a bakery, right?
[186:50.64]And like the bakery, I dropped the baby.
[186:52.46]The baker catches the baby in a bunch of like dough or something, right?
[186:56.65]Yeah.
[186:58.11]And then finally I make it all the way down.
[187:16.12]Excuse me.
[187:16.62]Uh, I was about to think about stopping playing this game until I just saw the next area.
[187:22.48]So, I'm sorry, we're staying.
[187:25.02]I was literally, I was literally about to say, hey, let's go, let's check out another game.
[187:30.14]Nope.
[187:37.19]Cool.
[187:53.45]The music really just kind of sounds like it's coming out of an AM radio in a car.
[188:00.03]Am I the only one hearing that?
[188:11.17]It sounds weird.
[188:16.30]Where's the two?
[188:38.14]That was simple.
[188:39.46]I couldn't have made that any easier.
[188:40.75]Dreamer, can you please get the world record for clapping?
[188:46.17]Yeah, sure.
[188:46.49]I'll do it right now.
[188:55.34]Come on.
[188:58.48]I can't.
[189:01.61]How many is it in one second?
[189:03.33]I could probably do it.
[189:17.09]How many how many claps in one second is the world record?
[189:30.68]How many?
[189:43.84]The one minute record is 1100.
[189:48.84]Oh my goodness.
[190:03.46]1,100 in a minute is how many in a second?
[190:05.13]18 claps in one second?
[190:13.77]Okay, I need to slow this down.
[190:22.79]How many was... that was... I think that was 10.
[190:30.32]You can't do 18 in one second.
[190:34.46]Think about how fast that is.
[190:38.47]I think that was me doing the like... That was like... That was probably 15 times.
[190:53.05]How do you physically do that?
[190:55.07]I can do, like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[190:57.55]I can probably do, like, six or, like, ten.
[191:00.63]That's crazy.
[191:05.53]Watch the video.
[191:06.27]Is it a video?
[191:27.69]It's time to Okay.
[191:41.67]There's an ad just hold on.
[191:49.19]Okay, so this is the world record.
[191:53.01]This is the world record you saying right here?
[191:56.11]World record, most claps in one minute.
[192:03.75]Well, they have to show it.
[192:06.61]Wait, what?
[192:07.17]Hello, my name is 708.
[192:08.89]I'm going to try to break the record of speed clapping.
[192:12.72]We're going to start.
[192:13.68]So we're out on the mark.
[192:34.79]This music does not fit, can I just say.
[192:45.36]Wow.
[192:58.09]I'm so confused.
[192:59.13]So he is essentially sliding.
[193:04.84]This is one hand clapping.
[193:06.76]What?
[193:07.02]Put it in slow-mo?
[193:36.59]OK, so I see what's going on.
[193:43.25]So he's he's hitting the bottom part of his palm with the top of his fingers on the opposite hand.
[193:50.26]So he's going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[193:51.98]Let me try.
[193:58.82]So it's like here and then here so that he's hitting this is where the contact is, is here and here.
[194:23.46]How do you do that for a full minute?
[194:29.46]Bad form?
[194:30.36]How do you do that for a minute?
[194:42.37]Go for it for a minute.
[194:43.17]Alright, I'm going to do it for a minute.
[194:44.91]Time me.
[194:59.68]You guys, should we tie me?
[195:00.86]Turn the, okay, let me, let me get my noise gate off.
[195:02.97]Hold on.
[195:35.79]Okay, alright, that's fine.
[195:36.73]Alright, let me try it.
[195:41.07]Is that better?
[195:41.51]Is the noise gate gone?
[195:44.39]Okay, here we go.
[195:48.09]Okay.
[195:50.07]Three, two, one.
[196:02.30]Timing.
[196:39.42]My arms are fucking burning!
[196:41.02]Don't do it down there.
[196:56.72]Don't do it down there.
[196:58.04]Don't do it down here.
[196:59.84]Don't do that down here.
[197:03.14]You do not want this sound to be playing while I'm doing it down here.
[197:09.29]That is so much strength to do that.
[197:11.83]Even just fucking faking it.
[197:15.52]Even just faking it.
[197:16.56]That hurt bad.
[197:19.36]That's unbelievable.
[197:23.74]That takes actual talent and skill to do that.
[197:29.16]Okay, let's go.
[197:39.48]You had me for a little bit.
[197:41.78]Pac-Man!
[198:07.39]Oh yeah, that was such a weird.
[198:09.75]Oh yeah.
[198:28.27]Don't even.
[198:34.31]Kermit's whole arm weighs five pounds?
[198:35.89]Yeah?
[198:36.23]Is that what you think?
[198:37.94]Is that what you... say that again?
[198:40.62]Yeah, say that again.
[198:42.26]You think that's what you think?
[198:44.80]I got a big fucking arm.
[198:58.45]If the same thing happens again, I'm going to scream.
[199:02.17]Nice turkey arms.
[199:04.49]That's fine.
[199:04.95]Call me a turkey.
[199:06.55]Oh, he's got a turkey neck.
[199:07.57]He's got a turkey arm.
[199:08.26]Turkeys are one of the most vicious fucking animals on Earth.
[199:11.76]They're so deadly and they're crazy.
[199:13.78]They will attack you and they're very deadly.
[199:17.48]They're incredibly strong.
[199:18.78]You ever seen a turkey?
[199:22.19]Have you guys actually seen a turkey in real life?
[199:25.13]They are massive, majestic beasts.
[199:28.81]They're huge and they're very dangerous.
[199:52.57]Turkeys are docile.
[199:53.95]Turkeys are very, very strong.
[200:06.00]You know like the zodiac signs?
[200:12.24]I wish mine was a turkey.
[200:36.92]These games get pretty good graphics.
[200:41.92]This is a cute game.
[200:56.75]Is there a game pivot coming soon?
[200:59.49]Oh, you know what?
[201:00.63]Did Vampire Survivors have an update?
[201:01.83]I feel like it did.
[201:03.65]Did I play it?
[201:05.41]Dude, another game came out that was just, it looked just like Vampire Survivors.
[201:09.28]It came out like two days ago.
[201:11.56]Is that one any good?
[201:18.48]It's really good.
[201:26.15]It's got something else survivors.
[201:28.51]It's just Vampire Survivors is what it looks like.
[201:32.55]Oh, come on.
[201:51.12]Taco Bell or McDonald's?
[201:52.12]Well, that depends on what you're going to order from Taco Bell.
[201:56.19]If your order at Taco Bell is the cheesy gordita crunch, then that's what you're going to get.
[202:02.63]If you get some other weird bullshit from Taco Bell that's not very good, then I'm sorry, I'm going to have to tell you, I'm going to recommend not.
[202:15.63]Oh, I like this level.
[202:24.20]Doritos tacos.
[202:24.94]Doritos tacos are... I always feel so bad eating them.
[202:29.42]Because I just know there's almost nothing that I really want in my body from that.
[202:34.76]But you can't deny that it's one of the greatest tasting things in the world.
[202:38.40]How am I doing?
[202:39.46]I'm doing okay.
[202:39.96]I'm doing good.
[202:56.53]Good as I can be, right?
[203:02.72]I'm on a fast stop.
[203:04.78]I'm so sorry to hear that.
[203:05.62]Yeah, that's that's hard.
[203:11.63]Uh, when I had my colonoscopy done, I remember you have to fast for three days.
[203:15.69]Uh, I think it was like three, four days.
[203:19.67]You can't have food.
[203:22.06]You can have clear liquids, and I think that there's one or two very, very basic small things, but you can't eat food for three days.
[203:34.87]One of the things that happens, it's not the fact that not eating food that is what caused me problems.
[203:40.81]It's like, I can handle that.
[203:41.89]Look, after a day or two where you just... God, I just want a fucking steak.
[203:47.45]But what really is the problem for me, it's not the... It's the fact that the headache, that kind of... Like, you have had no real nutrients for two or three days.
[203:58.34]You just have this migraine that is just awful.
[204:01.10]At least that's what happened to me.
[204:04.16]Yeah, the actual procedure is simple.
[204:07.83]It's one of the easiest things in the world.
[204:11.09]It's the prep for a colonoscopy.
[204:12.52]That sucks.
[204:14.16]The procedure is easy.
[204:16.14]It's 100% simple.
[204:17.32]There's a fruit that's Bondo.
[204:21.23]Get it.
[204:41.80]Alright, open that door.
[204:44.50]How did I miss the first N?
[204:50.78]Do you have any pictures from the procedure?
[204:55.96]I'm definitely not going to share my colonoscopy photos.
[205:00.51]I think that would get me banned from Twitch.
[205:04.45]I'm not sure you can do that.
[205:13.42]They give you this drink that you have to drink over the course of a couple days.
[205:17.31]And let me just tell you without giving you too much detail.
[205:22.23]It makes you do something over and over again.
[205:32.16]Just distort the image.
[205:44.98]You can use your imagination.
[205:48.74]I want to see what the boss of this area is, and then we'll play either Vampire Survivors, or I want to, maybe I'll try that new one.
[205:54.32]You guys are telling me, let me actually figure out what the hell it's called.
[206:00.92]It's called, it came out like today.
[206:05.04]It's called Soulstone Survivors Prologue.
[206:09.91]It's not the full game, I guess.
[206:11.23]Is that one any good?
[206:14.65]Should I try it?
[206:18.15]It's pretty good.
[206:37.58]You know, I kind of wish there was a retro mode to see what this looked like 15 plus years ago, whatever it was, 20 years ago.
[206:53.39]Are you gonna rage quit Pac-Man?
[206:54.92]No, I'm not.
[206:57.64]I was just considering a pivot.
[207:05.53]I feel like this game's pretty long.
[207:06.49]It's probably at least six to seven levels long.
[207:22.47]Remember, I'm the never complete a game Andy.
[207:25.11]Unless it's a FromSoftware game.
[207:43.70]Ooh, what's in here?
[207:44.46]Why would I need this?
[207:52.20]water somewhere that I missed?
[207:53.54]Oh well.
[207:57.66]Do a BRB then switch game?
[207:58.74]Yeah, that's what I'll probably end up doing.
[207:59.90]I mean, is there... How far am I to the end of the game?
[208:09.65]Is there another area?
[208:10.31]There's probably at least one more area after this.
[208:16.90]Two more worlds.
[208:30.24]World four of six.
[208:35.58]Do I want a complete Pac-Man world?
[208:37.64]Just to say that I did.
[208:40.82]Or do I leave this up to interpretation for you?
[208:42.94]Because you guys, you can find out for yourself what happens in the end.
[208:51.79]Does the evil Pac-Man kill everyone?
[208:57.04]and take over pack world I don't know I guess but I don't know if we're ever gonna know ooh hot plates
[209:33.77]Why?
[209:34.29]I just want to see the clown boss.
[209:42.77]And then, alright, do a poll right now.
[209:44.99]Should I play the new Vampire Survivors uh Vampire Survivors like or should I play Vampire Survivors?
[209:55.30]Let's do a vote.
[210:15.03]Don't even fall.
[210:26.16]What am I looking at here?
[210:27.66]Wait, can I not?
[210:28.72]Oh, over here.
[210:31.96]ULTRAKILL, got an update.
[210:33.96]I don't know if I'm in the first person shooter crack mode right now.
[210:46.28]I don't think I'm in crack mode at the moment.
[210:50.14]Come here.
[211:04.99]Next thing we're going to do, we're going to go back to sorcery part three.
[211:08.30]That's what we're going to do on Wednesday.
[211:11.40]And then wait, hold on.
[211:21.82]Alright, alright!
[211:25.45]So I can officially announce.
[211:27.61]Alright, it's time for the official announcement.
[211:30.63]I, Jeremy Elbertson, aka Jerma985, on Thursday, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna be on Name Your Price, Austin Show.
[211:44.68]Oh my god, why can I not just remember to press the jump button?
[211:56.49]I will be on Name Your Price.
[211:58.77]I think I'm going to do a pretty good job.
[212:01.77]What time is it going to be at?
[212:04.35]I don't... I think somewhere around 2 Pacific?
[212:07.19]I think?
[212:10.21]Somewhere between 1 and 2 Pacific?
[212:14.86]It's a game show.
[212:17.08]Who am I going to be against?
[212:17.88]I actually don't know.
[212:21.18]You'll have to watch.
[212:26.81]You're going to play Glover?
[212:27.61]How do we watch it?
[212:32.51]It's going to be on Austin Show.
[212:38.25]You don't know Austin Show?
[212:43.55]I would go follow it now.
[212:44.71]Follow the channel.
[212:46.93]Follow Austin.
[212:58.20]He's a streamer!
[213:05.01]Is it gonna be on Twitch?
[213:05.85]Yes!
[213:07.67]It will be on twitch.tv.
[213:11.71]I'm very excited.
[213:12.75]The concept of the stream... It's a game show, obviously.
[213:17.99]And it's kind of like, um... They show products.
[213:23.27]And you have to guess who gets closest to what the actual cost of the product was or is.
[213:29.89]Kind of like, um... Almost like Left Price is Right.
[213:32.19]Kind of style.
[213:35.73]I think I'll do a pretty good job.
[213:53.47]Sounds good.
[213:56.65]Yeah, no, it should be fun.
[213:58.71]I'm excited.
[214:00.33]It's going to be in person too.
[214:03.01]So it is.
[214:10.02]Oh, that was a tough jump.
[214:16.48]That's this Thursday at 2 p.m.
[214:18.72]Pacific.
[214:21.74]on Austin's channel, Austin Show.
[214:23.36]I'll tweet it out.
[214:26.24]Yeah, I'll make sure to tweet it so you know where it is.
[214:32.64]Are you going to be cringe or funny?
[214:35.47]I'm going to win.
[214:36.69]I'm playing to win, guys.
[214:47.57]Do you even buy household products?
[214:52.25]No, I haven't bought cleaning supplies in 10 years.
[214:56.03]I don't even know what aisle it's in.
[214:59.79]What are you talking about?
[215:02.99]Alright, this is it.
[215:14.96]Please don't embarrass us.
[215:16.08]I'm going to.
[215:16.52]You're going to be ashamed that you know this channel after Thursday.
[215:29.38]Did I just fall?
[215:29.90]I like the clown ghost.
[215:40.87]That's funny.
[215:41.47]Alright, what's the boss?
[216:03.32]Oh cool, it's the same song.
[216:04.38]Oh, I thought you were actually happy about that.
[216:21.28]How many songs did the original one have?
[216:30.36]Oh my god.
[216:31.18]Okay.
[216:31.80]Alright, if I die one more time, I'm changing to the vampire survivor.
[216:36.73]Wait, did we even do a pull?
[216:38.21]I completely forgot.
[216:39.63]Did we run a pull?
[216:48.32]So what happened?
[217:06.13]Wow.
[217:06.85]I still died.
[217:07.98]I'm so...
[217:41.19]I feel like my eyes just went frosty.
[217:58.80]Flutter to the end of the level.
[218:18.15]Oh shit, I can't.
[218:20.39]I'm not high enough.
[218:30.52]It stopped!
[218:31.32]It actually stopped.
[218:32.64]I didn't stop that.
[218:33.88]I hit the limit.
[218:38.80]That's quite the limit.
[218:39.96]Why even have a limit?
[218:41.30]Why is there a limit at that point?
[218:43.90]Is it even necessary to have a limit?
[218:49.77]Alright.
[219:09.74]I just want to hear the clowns laugh.
[219:16.50]The boss clown.
[219:19.79]And then we'll move on.
[219:28.36]No, I don't care.
[219:29.00]Never mind.
[219:29.44]Alright, what's this game called?
[219:37.87]That was Pac-Man World.
[219:38.73]It was actually pretty fun.
[219:39.51]It was actually a fun game.
[219:41.01]I just, I don't care.
[219:43.09]It was fun.
[219:43.85]It was enjoyable.
[219:45.41]I think it was definitely worth playing.
