[00:01.91]Okay, we are clear.
[00:02.99]Yeah, Houston, we have liftoff.
[00:08.42]Watch out for that asteroid.
[00:10.71]Oh, look out.
[00:13.13]Like a pleasure to be.
[00:14.03]Fuck you.
[00:15.66]Can you get in the server first?
[00:17.42]I'm coming in right now.
[00:19.10]Please.
[00:19.34]I'm really hungry.
[00:20.00]Let's go to the restaurant.
[00:21.14]You want to go to a restaurant?
[00:22.18]Yes.
[00:22.66]What restaurant?
[00:23.54]Badlands.
[00:24.62]You know what?
[00:25.64]It's over.
[00:26.54]I'll tell you right now.
[00:27.44]No, I'm about to put my foot down.
[00:29.08]It's over.
[00:29.74]What drugs are you on today?
[00:32.23]My TV show is over so we can play.
[00:33.81]You want to have a sniper duel?
[00:35.93]I'll do you right now.
[00:37.11]I'll do you right now.
[00:39.21]It doesn't sound right when you say it that way.
[00:41.17]Hey.
[00:42.13]What are you doing?
[00:42.75]Where are you going?
[00:43.55]Where are you going?
[00:45.11]I'm going to you with my Kirby.
[00:47.29]Oh, yeah?
[00:47.95]It's over!
[00:49.92]Got you.
[00:50.48]I don't think you gave it the full it's over.
[00:52.42]Well, you have, like, editing capabilities.
[00:54.60]You know, you can do it if you want.
[00:56.50]Well, I guess I could edit anything there.
[01:01.27]Jeremiah, you think you're good enough to defeat the all-powerful, all-knowing Star?
[01:06.07]Oh, boy.
[01:06.43]You think you can stop my Kirbypan as it comes right for you?
[01:09.67]You think you're gonna be able to get- Boy, you think you're gonna get this?
[01:11.48]I think I got you.
[01:12.50]Star, let me tell you something.
[01:14.14]You are such a good TF2 player.
[01:16.62]You know, you won the duel.
[01:18.12]Then I'm gonna shit my pants.
[01:19.02]So you don't have to show any more footage.
[01:21.40]You win.
[01:21.83]It's over!
[01:22.35]Yeah, it was that easy.
[01:24.61]Are you kidding me?
[01:25.81]That isn't what happened!
[01:27.21]That is not what happened!
[01:27.81]That's exactly what happened!
[01:28.79]What are you talking about?
[01:29.71]No, it's not!
[01:30.83]That was bullshit!
[01:31.99]This is what really happened, okay?
[01:33.61]I was engineer, and you were scout, and you hit me with the ball during my magic show.
[01:37.45]That's not what happened.
[01:38.58]That's not even close to what happened.
[01:41.56]I am an engineer.
[01:42.32]I just want to do a melee battle with you.
[01:44.64]I say, I'm behind you.
[01:46.52]Yeah.
[01:46.96]I am behind you right now.
[01:48.12]Yeah.
[01:48.34]Alright, you ready?
[01:49.18]Yeah.
[01:50.06]Here we go.
[01:50.82]Melee fight.
[01:52.44]Wait, what?
[01:53.84]Wait, what the heck just happened?
[01:55.30]You just disappeared.
[01:57.15]Alright, here we go.
[01:58.31]Teleport back to... Yep, see you later.
[02:02.21]It's over.
[02:03.05]Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07.57]Welcome to the magic show.
[02:09.13]That's Superman.
[02:13.16]Oh, God.
[02:14.14]Here we go.
[02:16.24]Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
[02:22.54]You have my attention!
[02:23.84]Holy shit!
[02:25.58]What are you doing?
[02:26.97]What are you doing that we haven't done already?
[02:28.93]No, no, no, no, this is not how it happened.
[02:30.93]There's no way we sat around for 20 minutes with this stupid magician joke.
[02:36.63]It wasn't?
[02:37.03]That's not what happened.
[02:37.85]No, no, no, it was a seal.
[02:39.83]It was a seal joke.
[02:40.97]That's what I remember.
[02:42.37]I remember things really much better than you do.
[02:46.44]That boat needs to be defended.
[02:48.90]There's very precious supplies on that boat.
[02:53.14]for the seal spies.
[02:55.28]We need to be defending that boat to save the seal spies.
[03:01.78]Oh, that was, that joke cost money.
[03:06.06]It took the time to find the brown paints to figure out what their name was.
[03:10.90]You don't like this, the seal spy?
[03:12.90]If you have anything to say, now's the time to say it.
[03:17.02]It's over!
[03:17.62]Oh, ha ha ha ha!
[03:19.99]Oh, ha ha, you're doing like a fake sarcastic laugh.
[03:22.35]Ha ha, you're doing the seal spy joke.
[03:26.51]Yes.
[03:27.65]I'm, uh, I'm scared of you.
[03:30.29]So this is like hide and seek, but I'm a seal.
[03:35.60]Now it's funny.
[03:36.70]No, no, no.
[03:37.85]There was no truck.
[03:39.05]Look, the one thing that's been in common of this whole thing is it's over.
[03:44.25]That's been a part of all of our flashbacks.
[03:46.91]It has to do with something about it's over.
[03:48.93]I don't know what.
[03:50.87]Got one thing to say when you make your way out of this door.
[03:53.86]What door?
[03:54.88]When you come out of the spawn door, I just got one thing to say to you.
[03:57.42]The spian door?
[03:58.78]When you come out of this spawn door, I just got one small thing to say to you.
[04:02.02]It's over!
[04:03.68]It's over.
[04:04.70]Shit.
[04:05.28]We're not even spawning there.
[04:06.66]It's over.
[04:10.22]Why is this the one joke that you want to make?
[04:12.64]I want it to be over again.
[04:14.29]Oh, this joke sucks.
[04:16.73]It does.
[04:19.41]You're just stuck on this one thing.
[04:21.23]I can't get off of it.
[04:22.45]I don't know how to get off.
[04:23.59]Jerma, wait now.
[04:24.37]None of this is even adding up.
[04:25.65]I don't think I even played with you at all.
[04:27.71]I haven't played TF2 with you for four years.
[04:29.37]Yeah, I must have been playing with someone I like way more than you because you're dead to me.
[04:32.83]It's a big one.
[04:35.43]Back up.
[04:37.60]Alright, so train has stopped.
[04:41.10]Train has stopped, but they have... Is this funny yet?
[04:43.34]They have forward spawns, though.
[04:46.40]Yeah, so this doesn't even matter.
[04:47.58]Yes, it does.
[04:49.12]It'll matter once they recap.
[04:51.96]Let's... You gonna go for the stab?
[04:56.71]Come on!
[04:57.41]Come on!
[05:03.01]Hold on, sorry, no, wrong game.
[05:05.13]I'm gonna tell you right now, it was not TF2.
[05:06.97]You were not playing TF2.
[05:07.69]Oh, right, that's right.
[05:08.37]No, you know, I know this because I'm a scientist.
[05:10.88]I went to scientist and I got my bachelor's degree in scientific science.
[05:14.92]These people are having a little bit of trubs trying to get away from me.
[05:22.10]And their ties are viciously blowing in this wind.
[05:30.43]Everyone on this train is just... Okay, I want to leave.
[05:34.99]I don't like it here.
[05:36.35]I feel like I'm playing a horror game.
[05:38.39]Get out of my way!
[05:39.02]I can't even get out!
[05:39.82]I have to kill the zombies.
[05:41.56]Did he just shoot someone?
[05:45.70]Then he's sitting down!
[05:50.30]The door's open.
[05:50.96]We can get out if we need to.
[05:51.92]What is going on?
[05:54.58]I'm just making people sit down with my sit-down gun.
[05:58.38]Hello.
[05:59.10]Star, hello.
[06:00.61]Hey, what's up?
[06:01.31]What's up?
[06:01.59]What happened?
[06:02.33]What are you doing?
[06:03.27]I'm joining the server.
[06:04.33]Badlands, right?
[06:05.17]Yeah, what are you doing?
[06:06.15]We're supposed to have a sniper duel.
[06:07.24]What's wrong with you?
[06:08.36]No, we already did the sniper duel.
[06:09.72]I beat you.
[06:10.32]That was obvious.
[06:10.98]Or did we?
