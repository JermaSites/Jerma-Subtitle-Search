[01:04.14]Hello there.
[01:06.06]How's it going?
[01:11.50]How you been?
[01:13.86]I can finally finish laundry now.
[01:16.10]Ooh, laundry day.
[01:17.36]Alright.
[01:19.92]Sunflower reveal.
[01:22.50]Hell yeah.
[01:24.18]Not right now.
[01:24.74]I'm going to have to make you wait for it.
[01:25.88]You're going to have to wait around for it.
[01:33.95]We're doing that at the end of the stream.
[01:35.41]To keep my engagements up the whole day.
[01:44.62]Now, good to see you.
[01:45.90]I go over the plan this week.
[01:47.62]We'll talk about it.
[01:48.24]Are you going to play Pikmin 4?
[01:51.06]Since you loved 2 so much.
[01:54.12]Um... I don't know.
[02:00.27]I'd like to play Pikmin 4.
[02:03.13]But... I don't know.
[02:05.33]Maybe not on stream.
[02:06.63]I don't... Everyone thinks I hate Pikmin in the whole franchise.
[02:09.23]I don't.
[02:11.59]You're referring to complaints I had about the Wiimote.
[02:16.82]And how I was annoyed at the Wiimote controls.
[02:21.46]That's what that was.
[02:23.06]I really enjoy Pikmin.
[02:25.20]I think it's a great franchise.
[02:26.36]I think it's an amazing...
[02:28.76]A group of video games.
[02:30.28]I just had an issue with the way that the Wiimote was.
[02:32.67]Okay?
[02:35.99]He hates Pikmin.
[02:36.81]Yeah, whatever.
[02:38.41]Alright, so here's the plan.
[02:40.15]Today, I'm gonna finish Tripang 2.
[02:41.45]Just gonna play it and hang out.
[02:46.16]I'm at the last mission.
[02:48.32]But...
[02:49.81]There are at least three or four side missions.
[02:52.99]I'd like to do at least a few of them.
[02:55.59]There's also wacky cheat codes that I would like to do.
[02:58.62]So, we're not quite done with Trapang yet.
[03:04.76]This Sunday, the plan this Sunday is... Well, actually, I forgot to tell you too.
[03:11.14]And we're going to go over the sunflowers.
[03:13.77]It's not just sunflowers, by the way.
[03:15.17]We went ham this year.
[03:19.98]we got marigolds we got wildflowers we got sunflowers it's a whole fucking ecosystem over here you raised pigs alright so yeah we'll we'll do that I'm very proud of uh of what we've done they look wonderful
[03:45.15]You said you're gonna play Viewfinder when it comes out.
[03:46.79]It's out right now.
[03:49.06]I'm gonna give you what's happening on Sunday.
[03:52.88]Let me talk.
[03:55.32]On Sunday... I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2.
[04:01.29]I'm gonna play TF2 on Sunday.
[04:04.71]I'm gonna just kind of...
[04:07.10]See, I'm going to gauge kind of how I like it.
[04:10.34]I'm interested in checking it out.
[04:12.30]I did mention a month or two ago, at least, that I had the itch to play, like, Man vs. Machine TF2.
[04:20.13]So, why not?
[04:22.07]Why not do it on Sunday?
[04:24.81]We're going to play it for, like, an hour or two.
[04:28.11]Get back into the swing of things.
[04:30.05]See if I like it.
[04:31.43]And maybe I'll keep playing it.
[04:33.29]After that, we're going to play Viewfinder.
[04:34.67]So...
[04:36.80]We'll give it a little try this Sunday.
[04:42.61]Not on Sunday.
[04:43.21]That's the day I'm watching Barbie.
[04:45.55]Oh, sorry.
[04:46.61]That's the plan.
[04:52.09]That's going to be the worst stream of the year.
[04:53.60]Hi.
[04:57.62]I don't think you like TF2 then.
[05:05.02]Of the whole year?
[05:07.52]Why?
[05:15.24]Heck.
[05:20.24]Is Gunu gonna make another debut?
[05:22.54]No.
[05:23.16]Gunu is in one game.
[05:26.15]You should ban him.
[05:30.93]Hey.
[05:32.75]That's just... That's an opinion of the stream.
[05:36.64]It's an opinion of the stream.
[05:38.60]I cannot change that opinion.
[05:40.88]I can just scream at you.
[05:41.88]Okay?
[05:45.10]Anyways, you guys ready?
[05:50.61]Last mission.
[05:51.15]I don't think I'm going to do the last mission yet.
[05:52.51]I think it's probably a good idea to... Because I haven't played in like a week or two.
[05:58.43]I think it's a good idea.
[06:00.21]Is this good?
[06:00.57]Let's see if it's too loud.
[06:01.32]Is it too loud?
[06:01.82]Can we check?
[06:04.06]How is that?
[06:04.90]Is that bad?
[06:08.89]That's alright.
[06:13.73]Shotgun's a little louder.
[06:15.07]Seems alright.
[06:15.45]Alright, let me remember the buttons.
[06:17.49]I got... That's the slide.
[06:18.99]That's grenade.
[06:20.47]That's obviously that.
[06:22.79]H is to do a weld.
[06:23.93]I got Q is, I believe, slow down time.
[06:29.10]And F is cloak.
[06:30.84]Okay.
[06:32.12]I'm good.
[06:34.34]We want to hear your loudest scream.
[06:38.44]I don't think I... I can't scream loud.
[06:43.14]Anytime I scream, try to scream loud or anything, if I've ever tried to, it just kind of goes... It just kind of turns into like an air horn that you press too hard.
[06:54.26]Like, or like a, you know what I mean?
[06:55.89]Like the... My voice just breaks when I try to yell.
[07:07.26]He turned into a toy chicken.
[07:08.26]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[07:09.13]Alright, so I'm not going to do the final mission.
[07:13.77]I have been told that Tripang 2 has some really, really good side content, side missions.
[07:20.51]We're going to take a look.
[07:21.35]We haven't done any of them.
[07:23.53]We've done none of them.
[07:28.39]So what is left for us to do?
[07:32.77]Wait, didn't I do this?
[07:36.17]Didn't I do Site 83?
[07:39.19]Did it not save?
[07:42.99]Is one of these new?
[07:50.02]Yeah, it did.
[07:51.06]Green is a side mission.
[07:51.80]Yeah, but is this... Shouldn't there be... Shouldn't this one be open?
[07:55.34]Oh, this... Wait, wait, no.
[07:55.96]That's also a side mission.
[07:56.90]Alright, so where's the campaign mission?
[08:01.34]Where's the next camp?
[08:02.16]This one here, then.
[08:02.82]Okay.
[08:02.98]That's the one that's blinking.
[08:06.26]Alright, let's do... Let's do crash site.
[08:09.25]Destroy the crashed planes cargo or unidentified structure.
[08:15.19]In the United States, which one of these is good?
[08:17.13]People said there's a couple of really good ones.
[08:24.22]This one here.
[08:25.84]Unidentified structure.
[08:26.90]Oh yeah, let's go.
[08:30.72]Satellites tracked three armed individuals running in separate directions from the structure this morning at 3.30 a.m.
[08:37.62]I know how to read it.
[08:39.06]Identified as Horizon from their uniforms.
[08:42.46]By 8.20 a.m., all three had expired from exhaustion or exposure to the elements.
[08:48.14]Investigate the structure.
[08:50.32]Satellite scans initially detected 405.
[08:51.63]Alright, so we just go investigate the structure.
[08:54.37]I got it.
[08:55.69]We're doing it on hard.
[08:56.41]We plan on hard.
[08:59.07]Good to go.
[09:00.80]Don't call the sus guy at 3.30 a.m.
[09:12.96]You can read a clock, Pog.
[09:15.43]It gets a little weird once you go over... Okay.
[09:19.67]Once you go over, I think, 1,800 hours, my brain has trouble.
[09:25.88]Because, okay.
[09:26.22]Oh, 600 hours.
[09:26.52]That's 6 a.m.
[09:31.76]1,200.
[09:31.78]That's noon.
[09:32.54]Okay, 1,300 is one.
[09:35.20]1,400 is two.
[09:36.30]1,500 is three.
[09:39.10]1,600 hours is four.
[09:41.04]You know what I mean?
[09:42.84]I got it already fucked up already.
[09:44.31]I already have it fucked up already.
[09:46.63]It's literally just everything minus 12.
[09:47.89]Yeah, but I don't want to do any math.
[09:49.49]I don't want to do math.
[09:55.88]I am an A.M.P.M.
[09:56.98]Andy because, like, I just... I don't know.
[09:59.38]It's just easier for my brain to understand.
[10:01.86]American.
[10:02.92]I'm an A.M.P.M.
[10:03.64]Andy.
[10:03.89]I am.
[10:10.71]Are you scared that the sus guy, in quotes, is going to be uttered at your funeral?
[10:16.01]No.
[10:16.75]No, I don't think so.
[10:18.40]I don't think that's happening.
[10:20.06]I think it's going to be more about, like, hey, like, let's... No one's going to talk about the sus guy.
[10:27.61]At my funeral.
[10:28.53]Alright.
[10:32.18]I'm not even going to give that one a response.
[10:35.46]Okay.
[10:36.08]What guns do I want to take?
[10:38.80]I actually like these two.
[10:40.24]I like shotgun and I like... But should I take the sniper?
[10:48.20]Give me armor.
[10:49.94]Give me flashbangs.
[10:53.32]Bolt launcher was pretty sick.
[10:56.25]Especially when you do this.
[10:57.33]Alright, I'm going to take this.
[11:02.58]And then also this.
[11:06.24]I like the SMG.
[11:07.38]I'm going to do dual SMGs.
[11:10.64]I take this with me, right?
[11:13.04]I think so.
[11:18.68]Are you going to add Jerma Dumpy Butt Naked emote?
[11:22.68]Uh, I thought about it, but no.
[11:26.15]Just thinking like how much it would do for me.
[11:30.30]Alright, let's go.
[11:33.38]Alright, let's turn the audio up for me.
[11:37.08]Test one more time.
[11:40.04]Jump button works!
[11:41.70]Alright, let's go.
[11:42.10]Why do you read the worst chat messages?
[11:56.47]Sometimes what you think is the worst chat message to me is something that I think is funny to read out loud.
[12:01.29]So, I mean, there's that.
[12:04.23]But there's also, here's the problem.
[12:05.85]You also don't want to make it, you don't want to make it a thing where it's like, oh, I'm going to read, I'm going to read like the wacky comment out loud because then you start getting copycats.
[12:15.38]Oh, he's got to read my message.
[12:18.02]I'm going to say something fucking crazy.
[12:20.24]That's where I can't tell you the secret sauce because then, you know, it's got to happen naturally.
[12:29.72]Alright.
[12:31.57]So the goal is... There's people in this building?
[12:35.93]Or they ran away from this building?
[12:37.27]Is there something in here?
[12:37.91]Is there like a monster?
[12:38.67]Let's find out.
[12:42.15]That scared the fuck out of me.
[12:43.31]I forgot how loud that was.
[12:45.25]You can even see my mouse move.
[12:49.85]Didn't move.
[12:50.43]Did I go like... Okay, whatever.
[12:53.75]Turn that down.
[12:54.81]Okay, I actually am because that was pretty bad.
[12:58.92]This should be alright.
[13:04.84]What's this?
[13:08.91]To patrol team, when you're back, meet us at the vault entrance.
[13:11.61]We haven't heard from the eggheads in two days.
[13:13.97]The vault is locked.
[13:14.77]We're going to breach it and check.
[13:21.45]Can I break into this?
[13:25.05]Yeah.
[13:30.10]What's in here?
[13:32.04]Okay, this is...
[13:34.75]This is like a safe room.
[13:41.03]Is the burp?
[13:42.83]Do I want to take this?
[13:46.06]No.
[13:47.30]I'm happy with these.
[13:47.88]It's a gamer room.
[13:52.36]It kind of is a gamer room.
[13:53.26]It's alright.
[13:54.98]Go down.
[14:02.26]This is going to be a monster that's in here somewhere.
[14:04.50]This is going to be like a monster going into the fridge and like drinking out of the fucking milk.
[14:11.53]I'm going to catch him and it's going to go.
[14:12.73]Ooh.
[14:12.97]Uh, okay.
[14:33.51]What was that?
[14:36.70]What the fuck was that?
[14:37.48]I'm not even scared.
[14:42.72]Alright.
[14:43.00]What does this say?
[14:43.62]Feeling uncertain about any progress.
[14:45.08]The others are mostly keeping me in the dark.
[14:48.05]but had a good conversation with Dr. Partridge yesterday.
[14:51.45]He seemed unusually interested in my books, especially the ones pertaining to my faith.
[14:56.82]I lent him an entire bag of books to satiate his curiosity.
[15:01.44]It will be interesting to chat with him next time.
[15:03.42]Okay.
[15:14.19]I'm going.
[15:14.65]I'm taking this one out first.
[15:24.02]I, okay.
[15:25.78]I'm very aware of my nose right now and I hate it.
[15:29.92]You don't know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[15:33.68]Right now in the game, I'm very aware of my nose.
[15:35.96]And it's, I'm looking down at it, I can see it.
[15:38.84]I can see my nose right there.
[15:40.78]Oh, what the hell.
[15:44.78]More intel.
[15:48.06]In game?
[15:48.90]Yeah, in game, but also that's kind of what happens in real life.
[15:52.96]When you become aware of your nose.
[15:55.62]Wait, it's just right there.
[15:59.86]I can see it.
[16:04.17]Big nose gang.
[16:05.45]I kind of have a big nose, yeah.
[16:12.15]Alright, first sign of blood.
[16:14.87]What's going on here?
[16:17.73]Ugh.
[16:18.81]Okay, trial and error.
[16:19.65]We've just decrypted the data encoded within the DNA of the biomass sample.
[16:24.47]Biomass exhibits a remarkable ability to alter its own genomic sequence in response to the input data.
[16:31.65]Okay.
[16:34.30]Limited internet access.
[16:35.44]The lack of availability training is okay.
[16:38.98]Mechanism underlying the encryption scheme employed by the biomass is unusual.
[16:43.44]Okay.
[16:46.56]I don't know why.
[16:47.12]I don't know why I read this.
[16:50.69]Right to left.
[16:53.31]Down to up.
[16:56.21]Do you notice that is what I just did?
[16:58.79]That was kind of weird.
[16:59.76]I don't know why I did it like that.
[17:01.32]Alright, well, whatever.
[17:06.76]This looks promising.
[17:21.22]Oh shit.
[17:23.46]Okay.
[17:25.36]Is there gonna be like a weird person in here?
[17:30.58]Oh god.
[17:34.58]What is- Oh, that's the biomass.
[17:45.34]This is kind of a maze.
[17:46.30]Something's gonna attack me.
[17:48.71]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[17:56.35]Something growling.
[18:07.58]Like a coffin.
[18:17.02]System initializing training sequence with dataset 41.
[18:20.38]Unknown.
[18:21.02]Economic collapse.
[18:21.91]Poverty.
[18:22.29]The end of civilization.
[18:23.95]Unknown.
[18:24.25]The end is near.
[18:26.03]System error.
[18:26.69]Unexpected output detected.
[18:27.87]Running diagnostics.
[18:29.45]The end is inevitable.
[18:31.25]Data corruption identified.
[18:32.37]Dataset 41.
[18:33.19]Contents replaced with unauthorized data by user A. Partridge.
[18:37.84]Unknown.
[18:38.16]Apocalypse.
[18:38.66]Destruction.
[18:39.16]The end of all things.
[18:40.56]Emergency.
[18:41.76]Everything's going.
[18:43.42]Absolutely.
[18:53.35]This thing's moving.
[19:06.34]I put a fucking hole in its head.
[19:11.53]What do I do?
[19:15.19]Oh my god, it's talking.
[19:16.31]Alright, this thing over here is blinking.
[19:17.75]I'm gonna press this button.
[19:21.87]Shut it down.
[19:30.19]What the fuck is happening?
[19:33.87]Did I win?
[19:34.23]This is going to be some Slenderman bullshit.
[19:44.32]Look, there's like five TVs to turn off.
[19:50.93]Oh my god.
[19:51.75]I'm just going to run.
[19:52.25]I think I'm just going to run over there.
[19:59.06]This is actually gonna be horrible, isn't it?
[20:00.88]Just go, go, go!
[20:04.58]Go as fast as you can.
[20:05.64]Ah!
[20:13.23]Oh.
[20:13.31]What is that?
[20:16.19]Is that a pencil?
[20:17.31]What's this giant pencil?
[20:21.48]Why is there a giant, goofy, novelty pencil?
[20:26.68]Am I looking through that?
[20:33.69]It's the spear from the spear gun.
[20:36.05]Oh, okay.
[20:37.63]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[20:40.79]The thing is huge.
[20:44.61]Fuck you, game.
[20:45.55]Alright.
[20:47.33]I'm just running.
[20:52.06]Whatever.
[20:52.42]Something's going to be right here.
[21:08.24]yeah nice spoiler auto save oh god I think it's gonna throw a grenade over here there's one more TV right in the middle
[21:42.53]This thing's going to get up.
[21:51.60]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[21:57.23]It's behind me.
[21:58.75]It's definitely right behind me.
[22:00.79]It's right behind me.
[22:01.85]It's right behind me.
[22:13.40]What's going on?
[22:14.07]Why is everything so quiet?
[22:15.57]Why is everything so silent?
[22:16.53]What's going on?
[22:18.77]That was scarier because it was so quiet.
[22:21.91]What do I do?
[22:29.66]This- This is no audio.
[22:31.38]Uh oh, I think I broke it.
[22:33.04]I don't know what I did.
[22:33.62]I think I'm dead.
[22:39.57]Where do I go?
[23:07.75]Let's go!
[23:15.11]Wait, what did that say?
[23:25.46]Shit.
[23:27.04]Okay, I think... I get it, I get it, I get it.
[23:28.46]I get it, I get it.
[23:28.98]I have to turn these off.
[23:53.29]It's actually scarier than a loud sound.
[23:56.18]Just off-putting.
[23:58.80]Alright, is this it?
[24:00.36]There's only one more.
[24:02.02]What the fuck was that sound?
[24:12.10]Turn it off.
[24:14.85]Got it.
[24:25.30]Do I fight that thing?
[24:26.34]Ah!
[24:37.95]The sound!
[24:38.57]I think I did it.
[24:50.12]Nothing else to do, right?
[25:24.13]I don't have any ammo left.
[25:28.89]There's gotta be something else I have to do.
[25:36.75]Jump into it?
[25:40.16]I don't know, I don't know what to do.
[25:42.92]Leave now?
[25:43.54]I thought the door was locked, isn't it?
[25:47.76]Oh shit, it's open!
[25:48.70]I, it was, this was locked.
[25:53.38]I have one bullet.
[25:55.76]Um... Oh god!
[25:57.22]They're behind me.
[26:06.57]Give me my audio back.
[26:12.21]There's nothing... There's no bullets in this gun either.
[26:22.93]Alright, we're good.
[26:24.77]What the fuck is going on?
[26:26.05]What?
[26:27.87]Is this us?
[26:28.39]Is this us?
[26:29.49]Is this us?
[26:30.21]Is this our team?
[26:30.89]Where are they?
[26:31.53]Alright, alright, alright.
[26:33.35]You can't get in here.
[26:37.86]I got a lock on the door.
[26:59.95]What are you doing?
[27:00.97]What the fuck?
[27:14.18]How many do you have?
[27:16.42]What do I just do?
[27:21.98]What?
[27:23.06]What?
[27:24.18]What?
[27:25.19]What?
[27:31.96]Just happened.
[27:33.40]Hey.
[27:34.02]All his Intel.
[27:47.41]OK, PhD computer science 62.
[27:55.15]HD 46 PhD.
[27:57.41]OK, personnel list.
[28:00.39]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[28:06.98]Okay, this thing's dirty.
[28:11.94]Where is he?
[28:13.50]Where is he?
[28:15.55]Where is he?
[28:15.87]Where the hell is this guy?
[28:19.83]Oh, there he is.
[28:29.40]We're out.
[28:38.70]I just took out all your men.
[28:45.31]I'm right here.
[28:46.23]That guy's a sniper.
[28:48.49]I'm literally standing still and he can't even hit me.
[28:51.71]Who actually sucks at this game?
[28:56.07]Look at this.
[28:56.95]You can't even hit me.
[29:00.06]Alright.
[29:00.62]There we go.
[29:01.92]I'm going up top.
[29:11.66]There's gotta be a sniper over here.
[29:46.87]Ow!
[29:51.79]What the fuck?
[29:52.54]They're at every angle!
[30:05.91]Single-digit accuracy?
[30:07.55]Dude, I'm being flanked at all sides by guys in Omega armor!
[30:29.66]You can't even see me from there.
[30:32.98]What is shooting?
[30:39.93]Well, get in here then.
[30:40.85]Stop just firing.
[30:50.94]Get in here!
[30:53.10]What game are we playing?
[30:58.32]I'm one person in here.
[31:15.47]I need a sniper rifle.
[31:16.95]I can't shoot.
[31:17.73]They're all surrounding me from every angle with laser pointers.
[31:23.60]I need a rifle.
[31:25.49]I have a weapon that is effective at like 15 feet range.
[31:30.43]And then this thing is empty.
[31:31.35]I'm going up top.
[31:32.99]Hurry.
[31:33.17]Go, go, go, go, go.
[31:33.73]Quick.
[31:34.09]I gotta get up there quick.
[31:41.55]Alright.
[31:41.95]I wanna go up, up, up, up, up.
[31:44.79]But being outside is death.
[31:51.38]I need to go up.
[32:06.25]I don't know.
[32:06.75]This is not even firing bullets, guys.
[32:15.72]What the?
[32:16.36]Alright.
[32:17.24]Is there a rifle?
[32:19.36]There's got to be a rifle up here.
[32:20.40]There has to be.
[32:21.84]There's no way there's not a rifle up here.
[32:24.80]Is that a... Kind of?
[32:26.86]No.
[32:28.38]You... What?
[32:35.95]Where's the rifle?
[32:37.39]You're holding a rifle?
[32:40.47]Ah!
[32:42.19]There we go.
[32:42.73]Now it's time for me to fuck up everybody.
[32:45.10]Watch this.
[32:47.66]How do you aim?
[32:54.72]How do you zoom in?
[32:55.40]How do you zoom in with a rifle?
[32:59.19]Anybody know how to zoom in?
[33:02.93]How do you zoom in?
[33:07.69]That's it?
[33:09.42]Oh, is it E?
[33:22.66]Where is this guy?
[33:24.52]What's going on over here?
[33:26.56]What is going on over here?
[33:30.30]Why were they there?
[33:31.14]I'm confused.
[33:46.25]He's mad?
[33:46.93]No, that was really weird.
[33:48.51]I got this smoke out of my fucking eyes.
[33:52.89]This guy sucks.
[34:02.52]I'm fighting an entire team of legendary warriors right now, okay?
[34:13.05]Where are you?
[34:14.11]Where?
[34:16.17]What the fuck are you doing?
[34:18.15]Don't scare me.
[34:33.80]Fuck.
[34:37.29]Dude, are you zonked right now?
[34:38.55]No, no.
[34:39.27]It's just that every angle is people.
[34:42.05]And there's smoke everywhere.
[34:57.24]I need a gun!
[34:57.92]I need a gun!
[34:58.78]I need a gun!
[35:00.42]Give me a gun!
[35:11.29]This dude is so high right now.
[35:12.85]I know I'm not.
[35:14.35]Yeah.
[35:31.99]Got him.
[35:34.27]Anybody else?
[35:48.35]What?
[35:50.74]Alright, we're good.
[36:04.04]Who else?
[36:05.01]Okay, okay.
[36:05.69]Alright.
[36:06.23]Alright, here he comes.
[36:09.87]Why is he so fast?
[36:10.53]Why is he so fast?
[36:12.77]Why is he so fast?
[36:14.53]What the fuck?
[36:15.03]There's so many people.
[36:16.05]Look.
[36:25.19]I got oh my god.
[36:34.55]That guy was useless.
[36:35.35]I got him What's wrong that guy alright, we're good
[36:58.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[37:09.05]Oh my God.
[37:37.52]Alright.
[37:41.64]That's gotta be it.
[37:43.30]That's not it?
[37:45.72]There's more?
[37:46.30]This guy's got a grenade launcher.
[37:54.12]Is that his head?
[38:19.66]Woo!
[38:21.62]You need to relax.
[38:22.36]It's just a game.
[38:24.97]It's not just a game.
[38:26.69]It's an intense experience.
[38:29.11]Can I have that grenade?
[38:33.47]Somebody said take the grenade launcher.
[38:34.63]Can I take it?
[38:40.05]That was intense.
[38:53.02]He's literally on a secret mission.
[38:54.30]Well, it's a side mission.
[38:57.04]Did I do it?
[39:00.56]That was crazy.
[39:03.22]Defend the fort.
[39:05.18]There's a gun mod in the house.
[39:06.26]I did see that.
[39:07.82]Where... Is this thing armed?
[39:26.95]It didn't go off.
[39:28.29]He was on top of a shelf, yeah.
[39:30.07]That was a fun one.
[39:30.95]That was a good one.
[39:55.90]What about the other side missions?
[39:56.90]Any other good ones?
[39:57.56]No.
[39:57.86]Do the oil rig.
[39:58.86]This way.
[40:26.29]What's going on in here?
[40:29.43]What the hell was that?
[40:33.00]No, actually, what was that?
[40:33.86]That was weird, wasn't it?
[40:40.10]Okay, well.
[40:47.47]Um... Any more unlockables?
[40:49.27]Give them red shoes, for sure.
[40:50.33]Maybe white?
[40:55.34]Uh...
[40:58.17]And fall rain.
[41:04.89]Let's just do fall rain.
[41:05.77]According to reviews, there's more wave shootouts to come in the side missions.
[41:16.49]That's alright though.
[41:17.37]Looks like Site 32 has caved in.
[41:20.87]Site 32 has caved in.
[41:21.83]Does that sound good?
[41:27.42]Alright.
[41:30.70]We did this one.
[41:35.00]What's another good one for the side content?
[41:38.04]Oil rig is locked, but it's really good.
[41:39.70]Okay.
[41:50.02]Do crash.
[41:50.52]Crash site is fun.
[41:52.17]Destroy the crashed plane's cargo.
[41:53.81]That sounds cool.
[41:54.75]I'll do it.
[41:56.16]Our forces downed a Horizon airplane.
[41:59.25]It was carrying high-tech weapons to be sold to an African warlord.
[42:03.09]Find the cargo and make sure it's destroyed.
[42:05.85]Unfortunately, it crashed into a former nuclear testing site in Algeria.
[42:10.39]The air is heavily irradiated.
[42:12.61]So watch your Geiger counter.
[42:14.12]Our agents have sabotaged several of Horizon's cargo planes.
[42:17.84]I need you to investigate one of the crash sites.
[42:25.50]I didn't even mean to do that, but I did.
[42:26.72]For weapons, I think I want... I need long range and short range.
[42:36.82]That's been my problem.
[42:40.35]That's my issue.
[42:48.81]What is a good long range?
[42:53.27]Maybe we just take the rifle.
[42:57.81]You don't need long range, just run faster.
[43:04.75]I'll... I'll take the rifle.
[43:08.19]This thing's pretty versatile.
[43:09.01]Okay.
[43:16.92]Do I want to do anything to it?
[43:19.82]No suppressor.
[43:23.72]Laser sight I feel like gives me away too much.
[43:26.58]Alright, now for the short range.
[43:33.24]Can you do aim down sights in this game?
[43:35.20]You cannot.
[43:36.58]Unless you have a scope on it.
[43:38.31]Or some type of aim down sights thing on the weapon.
[43:42.75]Pistol?
[43:51.79]Pistol?
[43:52.23]Somebody said I fucking hate this dinosaur.
[43:53.95]Why?
[43:54.29]What's this dinosaur?
[43:55.79]What's this?
[43:57.80]Dino dance.
[43:59.26]What's a dinosaur?
[44:03.46]You guys don't like the dino dance?
[44:06.38]I figured you guys would like the dino dance.
[44:08.34]This is a dancing community.
[44:11.18]We have six or seven different dancing emotes.
[44:14.36]I'm surprised.
[44:15.10]Alright, I'm gonna do shotgun.
[44:19.96]Shotgun, rifle.
[44:21.98]In fact, we're gonna do double shotgun.
[44:28.45]Even though I don't like this, I'm going to do it because I'm trying to make the fans happy.
[44:40.32]Incendiary Unfolded.
[44:43.46]How do I switch to the other weapon?
[44:45.60]Can I do the other weapon?
[44:47.82]Oh, that was weird.
[44:56.84]There we go.
[44:59.08]Alright, now we're good.
[45:01.44]This thing is going to be destructive.
[45:07.16]Full ammo.
[45:09.62]I got flashbangs.
[45:12.26]Armor.
[45:12.50]Good to go.
[45:13.84]It has the other attachments on already if you do weld.
[45:20.41]Ah, okay.
[45:20.71]That's good to know.
[45:23.15]It didn't look like it though.
[45:24.52]I had laser on one of the SMGs and it wasn't on the other one.
[45:27.62]Let's go.
[45:28.24]This is the hardest level in the game.
[45:30.84]Okay.
[45:52.84]Is this the hardest level in the game?
[45:56.60]Hey, I'm up for a challenge.
[45:57.57]Let's go.
[45:58.01]Okay.
[45:58.15]Somebody talking.
[45:59.25]What is all this?
[46:00.37]There is a sniper rifle here.
[46:02.49]I have an idea.
[46:18.92]I'm just going to come back and pick this weapon up.
[46:20.64]Remind me that it's here.
[46:22.12]Because I'm definitely going to do some sniping here like this.
[46:32.55]That was so bad I have to restart the whole thing.
[46:36.47]I missed five shots in a row.
[46:37.85]I have to restart the entire mission.
[46:40.90]Honestly, I should verify integrity of game cache on Steam.
[46:44.84]I feel like I fucking corrupted the game being that bad.
[46:50.24]Okay, let's go.
[46:51.12]I need to put a suppressor on this.
[46:52.82]Suppressor.
[46:53.18]Okay, here we go.
[46:53.87]I should be able to do this pretty easily now.
[47:22.24]Easy.
[47:23.48]Alright.
[47:23.70]Where else?
[47:24.04]Where's everybody else?
[47:26.26]There's a guy over here.
[47:32.41]Where is this guy?
[47:55.34]The guy is just spinning around with his flashlight.
[47:57.32]What's this guy doing in here?
[47:58.04]Hey, you tell me this is the hardest mission in the game, I'm going to listen, okay?
[48:14.07]I'm doing this the way I want to do it.
[48:16.38]I ain't messing around.
[48:33.02]Ooh, nice.
[48:34.58]Weapon pot.
[48:36.72]Homing?
[48:37.68]Ooh.
[48:37.96]Alright, I don't think I need this anymore.
[48:44.49]I'm gonna take this.
[48:45.19]Because this is pretty short range.
[48:48.25]So I'm gonna stick with this.
[48:50.81]I also have the double shotguns.
[48:55.77]Somebody in here?
[48:57.27]I'm gonna see if I can... Oh my... What happened?
[49:01.46]Oh my god.
[49:30.78]Yeah!
[49:32.88]They got fucking smoked.
[49:35.37]They did.
[50:05.21]I'm the shotgun guy.
[50:06.49]I don't know how to... Where's my supplies?
[50:15.32]Wait, what?
[50:16.58]That's an enemy right there.
[50:25.81]That's gotta be... That had to have been terrible.
[50:48.03]Oh, come on, bring it on.
[51:17.37]They told me it was hard.
[51:28.39]That guy exploded.
[51:29.25]Supplies?
[51:42.99]Um, I'm going with this thing.
[51:44.95]Is it the same weapon?
[51:46.59]Is it the same gun?
[51:47.71]No, it's not.
[51:49.91]I want this one.
[51:56.31]This thing's kind of hard to use.
[52:09.06]Two times scope.
[52:10.40]That's for this gun, isn't it?
[52:16.23]I'll put... Alright, we'll do all this.
[52:17.23]We'll do... Yeah.
[52:18.09]Yeah, that's fine.
[52:19.11]Two times scope.
[52:19.79]Nice.
[52:26.54]This is another 2x scope.
[52:35.46]Alright, where are they?
[52:41.35]Where is everybody?
[52:45.35]Ooh, give me that.
[52:53.42]This one person just hiding somewhere.
[52:55.08]It's still alive.
[52:56.14]You in the plane?
[53:14.59]Where even is this guy?
[53:22.77]Are you still alive?
[53:23.41]I don't see anybody.
[53:34.28]Bro, please drink some water.
[53:35.66]I got it right here.
[53:36.56]I'm good.
[53:38.96]I'm hydrating.
[53:39.53]Don't worry.
[53:41.35]Anybody know where this guy is?
[53:43.50]He's down.
[53:44.82]Oh, you made that up.
[53:49.06]I'm trying to get to the highest point so I get shot at.
[53:55.16]There is nobody left.
[53:57.42]Is there?
[53:57.62]I don't know what you object.
[53:58.82]Oh wait.
[54:00.98]Yeah, he's over here.
[54:05.54]What have you been doing?
[54:17.80]He's just shooting at rocks.
[54:23.04]What the fuck was that?
[54:24.76]Get him.
[54:25.22]Get him.
[54:25.68]Ooh.
[54:25.78]Give me that.
[54:27.42]Look at this.
[54:30.05]Alright, I'm ready.
[55:04.94]He was going to do that.
[55:08.10]I just got shit on by a bird.
[55:11.31]Really?
[55:11.65]I just got bird shit all over me.
[55:17.05]What the hell?
[55:20.67]Airstrike means airstrike, dude.
[55:22.56]I didn't know if they were talking about right here.
[55:24.54]I guess.
[55:28.00]So what do I do?
[55:33.07]Dude!
[55:35.07]What the hell?
[55:35.69]That almost hit me!
[55:46.94]What the fuck are you talking about?
[55:48.75]I thought that was a... friendly plane.
[56:02.11]Because it says supplies.
[56:04.41]Ready, watch, watch, watch.
[56:05.01]Ready, wait, wait, wait.
[56:05.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[56:07.79]Okay.
[56:08.45]Enemy activity.
[56:09.25]Firing.
[56:11.00]Look, that... Oh, that's... I thought... Okay.
[56:13.86]Usually... Okay, usually the ones that are indicated with white means that... I don't know.
[56:33.96]Maybe don't come down.
[56:34.90]I don't want that.
[56:45.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:47.05]I want this.
[57:04.04]Whoa!
[57:07.10]Oh!
[57:16.39]This thing's out of bullets?
[57:52.10]See ya
[58:19.70]Shit!
[58:39.94]I helped.
[59:06.09]Where is he?
[59:07.19]There's only one left.
[59:15.69]Where is he?
[59:31.70]Yes!
[59:33.48]We got another team flatline.
[59:35.32]Would you use some goddamn snipers?
[59:37.10]Snipers?
[59:37.54]You got it.
[59:37.82]This is whichever we have visual on target.
[59:41.95]I need a sniper rifle.
[59:43.53]Oh god damn it.
[59:44.81]Oh god damn it.
[59:45.43]Hold on.
[59:47.13]I need a sniper- Where's my sniper rifle?
[59:48.25]Where'd it go?
[59:48.57]I need a good spot.
[59:59.82]Right here.
[60:11.91]That guy dead?
[60:12.37]Right here.
[60:34.57]This is Wichita, bro.
[60:35.63]I got two men down.
[60:44.98]Where is he?
[60:47.48]Where the hell is he?
[60:48.00]Where is this guy?
[60:55.76]Oh, you're right there.
[60:57.76]I see.
[60:58.54]I see where you are.
[61:01.62]What's wrong with my sniper rifle?
[61:02.73]Why is my sniper rifle a go-kart?
[61:11.95]Oh, that's why.
[61:25.50]Get out of here.
[61:33.97]See?
[61:34.89]It's a white indicator.
[61:38.73]The enemy approaching is yellow.
[61:40.83]Yellow indicator.
[61:41.65]What do we got?
[61:45.49]Um... Good.
[61:47.93]I'll take the grenades.
[61:49.12]Affirmative.
[61:52.20]Commencing airstrike.
[62:00.95]That doesn't work.
[62:11.14]I gotta get over there quick!
[62:12.08]Come on, come on, come on!
[62:12.64]Hurry, hurry!
[62:15.45]Hurry!
[62:23.37]What?!
[62:28.34]What is- What are you talking about?
[62:35.22]I can't destroy the helicopter?
[62:36.66]I did not know that.
[62:37.36]It's okay.
[62:57.50]Ooh.
[63:03.01]Over there.
[63:14.46]Oh!
[63:19.44]Any more bullets?
[63:21.90]No.
[63:39.48]You think I care?
[63:48.20]OH!
[63:49.54]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[63:50.86]Why would he do that?
[63:52.10]Why would you do that?
[63:54.30]I didn't have- I had no shots in that fucking gun.
[63:57.07]That was the last enemy too.
[64:05.35]God damn it.
[64:08.26]What did you just drop?
[64:12.19]I just went like this.
[64:12.72]I just put my hands down on my chair.
[64:16.82]Okay, this time I'm not going to blow it.
[64:18.78]Because watch.
[64:20.96]I can't destroy the helicopter, so I'm going to wait.
[64:23.45]This whole thing is going to be so much cleaner now.
[64:24.91]Watch this.
[65:02.88]Much... What?
[65:05.44]I died like instant... Oh, somebody sniped me.
[65:11.82]I got sniped.
[65:15.99]It's all good.
[65:27.55]Shoot the rockets out of the air?
[65:41.60]That was pretty cool.
[65:44.04]Nice.
[65:45.34]Alright, I gotta get up high.
[65:50.88]That would have been great.
[66:00.83]Get on this!
[66:01.57]What are you doing?
[66:02.27]That just messed up everything.
[66:23.41]Alright, much better.
[66:24.13]We're good.
[66:30.07]Almost dead.
[66:30.47]I don't know what just hurt me, but... It was the sniper, probably.
[66:45.42]Okay, I'm fine.
[67:03.87]He's still alive!
[67:20.19]Is he?
[67:33.59]That guy.
[67:42.52]That was pretty good.
[67:44.44]That was pretty good.
[67:47.30]I knocked that guy into next week.
[68:01.79]Nice.
[68:04.45]Get him.
[68:10.91]I need a weapon.
[68:15.01]Just run around, get everything.
[68:19.11]Primary objective incoming.
[68:21.67]He's going to land and I'm going to throw a grenade right in his face.
[68:25.25]There's no more weapons.
[68:25.85]I can't get anything.
[68:31.24]You son of a bitch!
[68:33.69]Kill that fucking psycho!
[68:46.47]Damn it!
[68:54.95]Pick up a different gun!
[68:55.93]Pick it up!
[69:02.46]I need a gun.
[69:04.78]I got it.
[69:05.04]I got it.
[69:05.26]I got it.
[69:05.50]I got it.
[69:06.18]I got it.
[69:06.52]I got it.
[69:06.82]I got it.
[69:13.39]This guy's fucking relentless.
[69:24.51]I don't even know who's firing at me.
[69:30.11]He'll run out of bullets eventually.
[69:46.80]Dude.
[69:58.01]DUDE!
[70:02.79]I can't.
[70:04.33]I can't dude.
[70:05.29]There's too many fucking people.
[70:07.39]There's too many people.
[70:18.24]Die.
[70:19.96]Die.
[70:26.14]Oh my.
[70:30.02]I got one of those guns.
[70:31.18]I got one of those guns.
[70:32.86]I have one of those crazy guns.
[70:59.41]This guy's got so many grenades.
[71:00.85]Okay.
[71:09.02]Moment of truth.
[71:09.44]Here we go.
[71:09.90]Moment of truth.
[71:10.30]Moment of truth.
[71:19.74]I think I'm okay.
[71:20.90]I think I'm okay.
[71:23.80]Ah, yes.
[71:24.26]Alright.
[71:24.48]I'm good.
[71:24.74]I'm good.
[71:25.00]There's only like two more people.
[71:28.18]We're going to be very safe about this.
[71:35.31]Where are you?
[71:35.79]You're over here.
[71:36.51]There you are.
[71:38.95]One more?
[71:39.27]Ah, thank God.
[71:44.01]It's not it.
[71:47.18]What do you mean it's not it?
[71:58.10]Fuck what I just did.
[71:58.88]Nice.
[71:59.68]That was crazy.
[72:01.86]That was a wacky one.
[72:05.21]That's right.
[72:05.83]You are.
[72:29.59]Alright, we're good.
[72:31.97]Very good.
[72:32.73]Very cool.
[72:36.56]I cannot imagine playing some of these on a harder difficulty.
[72:42.28]I think hard is my limit.
[72:43.63]Very hard might actually be doable, but some of the two above very hard.
[72:49.09]That seems almost impossible.
[72:57.38]Alright.
[73:07.15]I wonder if I've unlocked any cheats.
[73:08.81]Good work, boss.
[73:28.47]Uh, somebody, I'm playing on hard.
[73:31.26]Let me see.
[73:32.56]Ah, okay.
[73:34.46]Unlock some squeaky voices.
[73:35.88]We're turning that on.
[73:39.92]Uh, no, we're not.
[73:41.88]Spooky mode.
[73:44.56]No checkpoints.
[73:50.33]Well, I want to be able to unlock stuff on hard.
[73:53.11]So when I'm done unlocking stuff, we'll turn a bunch of random shit on.
[73:58.83]Because if I turn one of those on, regardless if it's just a goofy one, it means every difficulty is easy.
[74:05.35]Or I can't get achievements for playing on hard.
[74:10.18]And I still have to beat the game.
[74:12.06]Alright, what else we got?
[74:12.88]Alright, let's beat the game.
[74:15.30]I'm going to unlock everything.
[74:16.98]So then I can just play the side stuff with cheats.
[74:21.40]Do you really care about achievements?
[74:23.42]Well, I care about unlocking things.
[74:25.68]And I think you have to play missions on normal or hard to unlock things.
[74:38.57]Alright, let's do it.
[74:42.38]Lead an assault on Horizon HQ.
[74:44.56]Destroy Horizon once and for all.
[74:50.54]We've finally done it.
[74:51.94]We destroyed Horizon's unethical research projects.
[74:54.48]We exposed their dark secrets to the world.
[74:56.57]Their stocks are crumbling.
[74:58.21]Employees are quitting en masse.
[75:00.17]The company lies in ruins.
[75:01.83]The CEO and executives are hiding in Horizon's corporate headquarters.
[75:06.07]Eliminate them and destroy Horizon once and for all.
[75:16.21]My accolades.
[75:18.60]Alright, let me get different weapons.
[75:22.43]Because this is a normal mission, so I want some different stuff.
[75:35.57]Alright.
[75:37.91]Flashbangs are useful because you can have five armor, obviously.
[75:42.30]I'm going single SMG.
[75:49.64]And it's gonna be... Unfold... Unfolded stock.
[75:57.08]No suppressor.
[75:59.76]And then... I'm gonna do... Honestly?
[76:04.26]Grenade launcher.
[76:08.78]Because... I just... I need some destruction power.
[76:17.52]Should I even do homing?
[76:19.20]Lower velocity grenades with a longer fuse that home onto enemies.
[76:22.28]Meh.
[76:22.56]I don't think so.
[76:27.16]Trevor, what kind of games do you like?
[76:30.15]I like games where you have upgrades.
[76:35.25]I love games that have interesting loot.
[76:40.90]I like casual games that you can play in bed.
[76:45.16]Those are fun.
[76:48.49]I like upgrading.
[76:55.04]Oh, you know what I got to play?
[76:56.54]There's a new game.
[77:00.86]Torment?
[77:02.84]What's it called?
[77:04.04]It's kind of like Vampire Survivors.
[77:05.54]It's new and it looks great.
[77:10.66]Halls of Torment.
[77:11.22]Yeah, that's one.
[77:12.34]I got to play that.
[77:13.34]That looks really, really... That looks pretty damn good.
[77:22.97]Is it good?
[77:29.15]Can you please jump into the helicopter blades?
[77:32.96]I tried already and it didn't work, so I'm sorry that I cannot do that.
[77:35.98]Alright, here we go.
[77:37.38]Final mission of the game.
[77:38.26]Let's do it.
[77:38.64]I think I'm good.
[77:41.90]I think I have a pretty good arsenal.
[77:47.98]Was that poker game you played on iPad?
[77:50.28]That would be Pine Tar Poker.
[77:53.01]very good pine tar poker pine tar poker they keep cutting me off pine tar poker on the app store it's a fun game it's a combination of yahtzee and also poker
[78:10.27]It's a very, very fun game to play.
[78:12.34]You've got maybe an airplane trip you're going to go on.
[78:15.58]It's a good thing to kill some time.
[78:18.14]If you want to just relax and, you know, you want to get like a little bit of a wind down scenario in your, you know, in bed.
[78:24.26]Alright, let's go.
[78:31.57]Let's go get them.
[78:35.95]It's time to use everything I've learned.
[79:14.28]Alright.
[79:16.25]Can we swap?
[79:17.79]Or is it time to dual weld?
[79:19.13]How do I open the door?
[79:38.87]Am I missing something?
[79:41.15]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[79:56.41]Holy shit, you're all so dead!
[80:33.84]Alright.
[80:35.04]The other door is going to open now, right?
[80:36.53]Oh, no.
[80:40.67]Open up everything.
[80:42.37]Take everything.
[80:50.68]Blow this up.
[81:01.68]Other side for sure.
[81:10.58]I wasn't even looking in the right direction.
[81:13.74]I got 10 bullets for this.
[81:14.86]Oh, yeah.
[81:15.62]This thing was a great pick.
[81:18.39]Good.
[81:18.79]Very good choice here.
[81:23.75]Yeah.
[81:24.53]I want the actual grenades.
[81:35.84]He's patting himself on the back.
[81:38.46]Yep.
[81:39.68]It's a good call.
[81:42.35]I made a good call what?
[81:45.69]I'm not allowed to say that was a good call.
[82:01.73]Alright, something to be right here.
[82:02.67]No.
[82:04.27]Alright, we're good.
[82:08.15]We want to go to the bridge.
[82:16.73]You'd think I would wait till I got out of the elevator before pressing the button.
[82:19.55]Alright, let's go.
[82:33.94]Yikes.
[82:42.58]What was that?
[82:50.01]Alright.
[82:51.33]Oh my God.
[82:52.19]He's still alive back there, whatever.
[82:57.46]Alright, do I have to get in the building?
[83:08.53]What's that?
[83:10.35]Remind me that this is here because they definitely want me to do this for some reason.
[83:17.91]Smart gun bolts home onto enemies.
[83:21.61]Um, yeah.
[83:38.05]Oh, okay.
[83:58.54]Are these bullets smart?
[84:22.65]Not that smart.
[84:23.39]You have to aim.
[84:25.62]Stand back, stand back, stand back!
[84:27.70]Stand back!
[84:28.92]Stand- How about these fuckin' Smot bullets?
[85:05.46]Who's left?
[85:05.94]You?
[85:06.16]I got him.
[85:14.12]Alright, let's... I gotta do some inventory.
[85:23.42]Where is this guy?
[85:39.89]Oh my god!
[85:41.05]Oh my god!
[85:41.77]I need to...
[86:14.74]Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme this, gimme this!
[86:25.60]There's no fuckin' ammo in this gun!
[86:30.06]I'm sorry!
[86:30.90]I can't fuckin' do anything!
[86:32.38]I can't reload the gun!
[86:41.23]Alright, come on.
[86:42.49]No more fucking around.
[86:43.61]Give me my smart gun.
[86:52.08]I'm overstimulated.
[87:13.56]Alright, these are smart.
[87:26.41]What the fuck?
[87:35.23]That guy was aiming at the ground.
[87:49.80]Oh shit.
[87:50.46]Are you alright?
[87:55.62]I'm going in.
[87:56.00]I'm going in.
[87:56.32]I'm going in.
[88:15.24]Give me some help up here.
[88:28.99]I don't know dude, like what the fuck am I doing here?
[88:33.13]I need to do-
[89:02.66]No!
[89:03.30]Stop being an idiot!
[89:20.45]No!
[89:22.79]Get off of there!
[89:26.45]Get out of my way!
[89:30.05]Dude, I got no guns left.
[89:31.09]I have no ammo left.
[89:32.43]You guys have to help me.
[89:33.69]You guys have to do a lot of work here.
[89:34.97]I have no bullets.
[89:50.82]Oh my god.
[89:54.54]Please.
[89:55.60]Give me his gun.
[89:56.70]He had a gun.
[89:56.98]He had a gun.
[89:57.28]He has a gun.
[89:57.80]He has a gun.
[89:58.20]Give me that.
[89:58.48]No, give me the gun.
[89:58.90]Give me, give me, give me.
[90:15.86]That guy didn't even exist.
[90:17.42]That guy didn't exist.
[90:42.44]Oh my god, your fucking oxygen tank is just such a pain in the ass.
[90:55.81]Okay, move up.
[90:58.75]Move up, move up, move up.
[90:59.74]You guys getting... I got it?
[91:05.62]That was crazy.
[91:09.94]That's not it.
[91:18.75]Oh my God.
[91:21.33]I'm trying.
[91:23.55]Cover me.
[91:25.37]Target down.
[91:26.33]Suppressive.
[91:30.02]Guard.
[91:31.12]Man down.
[91:38.50]Area clear.
[91:40.72]Director, we secured the lobby.
[91:42.90]Wow.
[91:44.43]Horizon senior leadership is hiding on the executive force.
[91:47.81]Take them out.
[91:50.83]That was awesome.
[91:52.93]Okay.
[91:53.75]Dude, that was augers.
[91:55.39]I'll keep the shotguns.
[91:56.91]Let me make sure I have ammo, though.
[92:03.76]Okay.
[92:20.69]Horizon factory explosion, chain explosion.
[92:22.97]That's just kind of a news story.
[92:25.69]Everybody alright?
[92:35.12]Pick up all the intel.
[92:38.26]I hereby tender by resignation from Horizon effective immediately.
[92:41.10]I'm deeply troubled by the recent revelation of the company's immoral activities.
[92:46.80]Okay.
[92:55.56]You know what video games do a lot and movies do this too?
[93:00.44]The trope of the CEO has a message that's just being played on giant speakers throughout the entire building.
[93:08.78]There's like a CEO monolog that plays.
[93:11.53]I don't think that's that normal of an occurrence to have the CEO be just like talking through giant PA system all day at work.
[93:31.13]It's almost over, 106.
[93:34.17]You do this at work.
[93:35.29]106, I can barely reach you on comms.
[93:40.77]Something's interfering with the signal.
[93:42.59]Uh-oh.
[93:44.99]I... I created you.
[93:47.17]You're burning down the hopes and dreams of thousands of scientists and innovators.
[93:54.30]Look around you.
[93:55.12]These aren't military targets.
[93:56.51]These are civilians.
[93:57.73]Have you ever noticed how the syndicate is always the aggressor?
[94:00.51]Always the invader?
[94:03.27]What you're committing today is injustice.
[94:05.81]It's genocide.
[94:06.75]Uh oh.
[94:15.63]Am I a bad guy?
[94:20.69]I'm sorry.
[94:21.19]I didn't really hear much of what you said.
[94:23.05]I was thinking of a really cool way.
[94:24.77]I was going to kill you.
[94:33.17]Ow.
[94:40.89]We need to all just got to chill for a second.
[95:04.78]Attention all personnel.
[95:06.26]Evacuate now.
[95:07.69]That's an order.
[95:10.07]Negative, sir.
[95:10.89]We can't do that.
[95:12.31]Still got you, buddy.
[95:14.67]Horizon is finished.
[95:16.11]There's nothing to die here for.
[95:18.35]Leave while you still can.
[95:21.71]We can't lose the brightest light of this generation.
[95:25.59]We're staying, sir.
[95:27.05]That's fine.
[95:28.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[95:32.31]It was an honor working with you all.
[95:34.20]How is he dead?
[95:34.86]Alright, this is going to get intense right now.
[95:45.38]Before you take off, just give me 30 minutes.
[95:47.22]I may be able to install something to help with the upload process.
[95:52.58]They're uploading the virus to the cloud.
[95:57.43]Almost got me.
[96:06.33]Fuck you.
[96:08.31]Ow.
[96:10.09]Ow, my arm.
[96:19.86]How is that?
[96:21.00]I want to know how it's possible that I just missed all those.
[96:24.24]How is that possible?
[96:27.10]That is impossible.
[96:44.88]More intel.
[96:45.56]There's a lot of intel here.
[96:47.91]Our employee satisfaction survey just leaked.
[96:50.57]It was all one star reviews.
[96:52.81]We need to find a way to cover this up as soon as possible.
[96:54.53]Maybe a few incentives will change people's minds.
[96:57.89]One star?
[96:58.69]Come on.
[97:12.84]Alright, here we go.
[97:36.39]I got running.
[97:42.54]They'll never see us through the blinds.
[98:19.27]That guy's head did a full 360.
[98:39.28]We good?
[99:04.50]Oh, he has a lawnmower gun.
[99:06.24]Alright, he has a lawnmower gun.
[99:21.45]Okay, I want the smart gun, but I want... Alright, there we go.
[99:38.91]Can I only have one of these?
[99:39.67]Uh, I can only hold one.
[99:44.59]I can't dual-weld the smart gun?
[99:45.95]That's too bad.
[99:46.73]That would have been so funny.
[99:51.92]If you're reading this, you are among the few who chose to remain and make a stand.
[99:56.37]I applaud your bravery.
[99:57.51]I am moved by your passion and belief in the company's values.
[100:02.45]Most of us will not live to see tomorrow.
[100:05.73]But the people of the future will thank us for the stand we make today.
[100:09.13]They may not know your names or your actions, but what we do here today will leave a mark in humanity's history.
[100:15.26]We cannot win today, but I still have one trick left up my sleeve.
[100:20.60]By last request, buy me some time.
[100:22.40]Your children will live in a better world for it.
[100:27.13]I'm going to smart gun this guy.
[100:31.60]Alright, should I not even give this guy a second to talk?
[100:35.02]I'm thinking about just revving up the lawnmower, opening the door, and just slow-motioning.
[100:48.55]Hi!
[100:52.17]He's just dead.
[100:52.83]Oh no!
[100:54.25]He did the joke.
[100:55.04]He did the joke.
[101:01.01]Oh no, it was the puzzler.
[101:07.40]It's your lucky quarter.
[101:12.70]This looks like a FPS map.
[101:21.08]Okay, I didn't even know what we were doing.
[101:23.47]That was like a first person shooter map.
[101:31.45]I didn't know we were changing maps.
[101:58.64]This thing is too hot.
[101:59.66]It's too hot.
[102:00.34]It's too hot.
[102:01.28]It's too hot.
[102:02.03]Got him in my sights.
[102:09.29]Loading a new clip.
[102:11.81]Wounded.
[102:12.03]Suppressing.
[102:21.09]Frag out.
[102:22.71]Flare out.
[102:23.77]I'm empty.
[102:24.23]Watch my back.
[102:30.27]Get this thing ready.
[102:48.22]I don't know who's up there, but I'm gonna make a funny joke and you'll know when it's about time for you to die.
[102:52.76]Here we go!
[102:54.60]Playing Mario Kart!
[103:02.53]Alright, where the fuck are you?
[103:10.33]He's so silly.
[103:11.59]Oh, that was so silly what I just did.
[103:13.44]I need ammo.
[103:28.44]What's this?
[103:32.58]Oh boy.
[103:33.48]Okay.
[103:33.88]Well, this is the final battle I think coming up.
[103:41.46]How do I want to be in the final battle?
[103:50.29]I feel like this thing is going to, I'm going to get rid of this very quickly.
[103:57.92]I'm not sure it's shotguns, honestly.
[103:59.78]I think I want a sniper rifle.
[104:08.54]As weird as that sounds.
[104:15.76]This might be really stupid, but I'm going to go sniper rifle and smart gun.
[104:22.36]I'm going headshots only.
[104:33.03]Smart bullets work aim down sights.
[104:36.23]What?
[104:39.27]I don't think there is an aim down sights unless I have to put it on.
[104:43.52]I'm going to try it.
[104:48.42]Here's the last piece of Intel.
[104:53.00]Calling any personnel who meet or exceed the following requirements.
[104:55.77]Cranial capacity over 1800.
[104:59.47]Master's degree or higher.
[105:02.23]You're needed for an emergency project immediately.
[105:07.18]Weird.
[105:10.74]Uh, I gotta pee real bad.
[105:11.92]Give me one sec.
[105:15.92]For the final battle.
[107:22.30]Okay, I have returned.
[107:23.40]I am ready for the final battle.
[107:32.90]Okay.
[107:45.13]I'll try sniper.
[107:47.89]You got to get the P out of your system before you do something like this.
[107:53.53]You married into it.
[108:01.19]It is hot out.
[108:03.54]Sorry.
[108:06.10]It is hot out.
[108:09.00]It's on a way more Chad.
[108:15.73]It's hot and dry out here.
[108:17.51]Alright.
[108:17.89]Give me some.
[108:18.51]Give me a little bit slack.
[108:21.78]It's very dry and it's very hot out here.
[108:25.12]I'm ready.
[108:25.56]Alright, where's the... Let's go.
[108:30.53]This way?
[108:42.08]Is dry or humid heat worse?
[108:44.90]Humid heat is the worst thing on Earth.
[108:50.60]I will take dry heat over humid heat every single day of the week.
[108:54.86]Every day of the week.
[108:58.00]In a dry heat, you do not really sweat.
[109:01.62]Which is actually kind of more dangerous in a way.
[109:05.04]Because you don't realize like, oh, I'm not sweating.
[109:07.52]It's so dry.
[109:08.20]Everything's fine.
[109:08.88]But it's like 110 degrees out.
[109:12.64]And dry, you got to be sure you're hydrating.
[109:16.06]Oh, we got to go this way.
[109:19.98]Alright, I got full grenades.
[109:21.00]I got full smart gun.
[109:22.16]I'm ready.
[109:22.52]This is it.
[109:22.96]Let's kick the door in.
[109:23.76]And I'm ready.
[109:32.09]Cutscene?

[110:10.44]Brain upload in progress.
[110:12.12]Wait.
[110:15.37]That guy just sprayed me in the face like a bottle, well, water bottle.
[110:20.89]What?
[110:27.65]Oh, I don't know Where's the brain?
[110:31.17]Where's the brain upload?

[113:01.65]That took a lot from the smart gun.
[113:09.21]Oh, God damn it, man.
[113:10.94]Okay.
[113:12.84]Alright.
[113:13.40]Alright.

[131:18.76]I want health.
[131:25.54]This game doesn't look very Christian.
[131:29.02]Oh, yeah.
[131:29.58]Probably not.
[131:30.36]I don't know.
[131:32.14]Alright.
[131:33.68]I have... I want a different weapon than this.
[131:37.57]We'll go with this because we're going to get spawned on.
[131:40.25]I'm going full firepower.
[131:44.21]And I have to take cover.
[131:45.65]Where am I going to take cover?
[131:47.69]It's probably a good idea to go in the building and hide here.
[131:49.43]Let's do it.
[131:53.42]Is it?
[132:12.02]Get the fuck out of here.
[132:13.43]Get out of here.
[132:48.80]What?
[132:51.00]Wait, is it me?
[132:55.86]Exactly, that's me.
[132:57.98]That's me.
[133:04.07]What?
[133:04.53]Wait, what?
[133:06.79]What did I do?
[133:08.11]I like teleported?
[133:09.29]Was I him?
[133:19.33]Did I, like, my consciousness jumped?
[133:20.91]How did I get through the wall?
[133:26.67]Break the cycle.
[133:27.53]How did I get in the... How did I get in?
[133:37.29]You've done more than anyone could ever ask for.
[133:42.02]There was some weird stuff going on early in the game.
[133:44.80]You know those drones?
[133:46.88]They're like, hey, don't trust people.
[133:50.42]Everything's not what it seems.
[133:53.74]And now the room's filled with gas.
[133:55.30]Okay.
[134:13.76]It was always meant to end this way.
[134:18.78]Liquidation process initiated.
[134:20.72]I'm getting liquidated.
[134:22.87]You're one of many cycles 106.
[134:24.47]Would have been cool to have one of those.
[134:36.19]That seemed like an awesome weapon.
[134:43.69]Each of you were created for a special purpose.
[135:12.83]I'm everybody.
[135:13.79]It's a different 106 every time.
[135:15.67]I'm everybody.
[135:19.33]No, it isn't.
[135:21.51]Not if I have anything to have.
[135:27.62]Not if I have anything to say about it.
[135:52.83]Why would you pick a gun out?
[136:07.82]Why would you take a gun out?
[136:10.01]And point it close to my face?
[136:13.45]I was about to be burned.
[136:15.97]Oh, that guy.
[136:18.33]Hey, they're gonna write a whole entire history book about how you fucked up right there.
[136:23.26]There's gonna be textbooks written about what you did.
[136:33.14]What's the intel?
[136:35.88]Terminate rogue assets.
[136:39.42]Is this what I am?
[136:42.56]Armor and speed improvements recommended for next cycle.
[137:17.96]Give me that.
[137:33.73]OK, yep, I'll stand out.
[137:35.75]What would you want me to go back and lie on the on the burn table thing?
[137:40.30]I can do that.
[137:42.06]Yeah, where was it gives back here, right?
[137:47.41]Stand.
[137:47.89]Yeah, here we go.
[137:49.39]OK, I'm ready.
[137:50.89]I'm really sorry.
[137:52.65]You can press.
[137:53.05]You can push the button.
[137:53.73]I won't do anything else.
[138:07.06]Who?
[138:08.58]Oh.
[138:20.63]Watch out for enemies.
[138:22.23]Shit, that was close.
[138:33.37]Corrector, 106 is going for the silo.
[138:36.73]We were friends, quartermaster.
[138:38.27]106 is trying to destroy the facility.
[138:40.72]We can't let that happen.
[138:44.44]Come on, troops, out of the devil.
[138:52.71]Really is not.
[138:53.71]It sucks to be that guy.
[138:54.93]The guy that opened the door.
[138:55.89]Yeah, I mean, come on.
[139:04.51]Oh my God, I'm so bad.
[139:20.86]Any health?
[139:25.60]There we go.
[139:36.52]There's a nice spam.
[139:37.78]Hey, you do what you gotta do.
[139:39.98]Alright, nobody else.
[140:00.00]OK, I don't.
[140:01.86]There's nothing really on the ground.
[140:02.96]Have I not picked up any shotgun ammo?
[140:06.15]Seems impossible.
[140:11.85]OK, where's the off switch for this?
[140:29.91]What do you mean, dude?
[140:30.69]Dude, what?
[140:32.13]Shoot the red?
[140:32.95]I have to pull one of those fuse boxes.
[140:39.37]What do you mean shoot the red?
[140:46.35]Dude, I'm sorry.
[140:47.37]I've never had to do that the whole game.
[140:49.65]I have not had to do that the whole game.
[140:50.79]I've been looking for a fuse box.
[141:01.96]Dude I didn't kill either one of them
[141:32.57]You know what?
[141:33.59]I got a better idea.
[141:48.48]Oh, it didn't kill you.
[141:49.28]Alright, it's alright.
[141:55.68]Okay, good.
[142:05.25]Oh my God.
[142:06.57]Oh, are we OK?
[142:16.22]Am I alive?
[142:17.02]I have one shot.
[142:20.14]Alright, I I gotta get ready.
[142:40.39]Shut down.
[142:40.73]I think I'm good with this for now.

[157:41.57]Go check them out sometime.
[157:43.43]Come join the community and hang out with us sometime.
[157:45.81]We love to talk with our fans.
[157:49.21]That was great.
[157:52.37]That was genuinely really, really, really wonderful.
[158:01.13]Okay.
[158:01.47]There's a lot of stuff here now.
[158:04.53]What do we want to do?
[158:06.21]Enemies activate physics thrusters on death?
[158:09.84]Insane gore.
[158:13.62]Let's do a couple at a time here.
[158:15.10]We're going to do squeaky voices.
[158:17.28]Wait, hold on.
[158:19.81]Let me just see what is actually unlocked here.
[158:25.36]Show the sunflowers.
[158:27.18]I will do that when I am done with Tripang 2.
[158:30.97]So, soon.
[158:32.27]Not immediately, but soon.
[158:33.59]Okay.
[158:39.43]Anything else on lock?
[158:52.58]Only one other mission here.
[158:57.74]The Gunnerson Complex is fun.
[159:02.78]Okay, just in the outskirts of Stockholm.
[159:04.38]The Gunnerson Complex is the center of Horizon's intelligence gathering in Europe.
[159:09.28]Assault the facility and retrieve the encrypted data.
[159:11.37]That's right.
[159:17.21]I don't really care about the achievements now.
[159:24.51]Let's do squeaky voices.
[159:29.87]NPCs throw a lot of grenades.
[159:37.14]NPCs respond as jiggly boys when killed.
[159:40.16]Okay.
[159:44.99]Scale enemy accuracy.
[159:46.51]What does that mean?
[159:50.09]Scale NPC reaction speed.
[159:52.17]Move speed multiplier.
[159:58.14]Cloak removed.
[159:59.22]Focus removed.
[160:00.40]Slide does not do anything.
[160:02.92]Your health constantly drains until 1%.
[160:07.86]Spooky mode.
[160:09.87]Infinite ammo.
[160:11.23]For a second I thought it said can't read.
[160:12.49]I was like, does that mean you can't look at intelligence?
[160:18.05]Everything is a knife?
[160:23.13]All weapons become inaccurate.
[160:26.47]Okay, there's a lot on right now, so we're going to do these.
[160:29.87]NPC thrusters, okay.
[160:35.13]Why is it so dark?
[160:38.60]Oh, because it's spooky mode.
[160:42.40]That just means the game is dark.
[160:50.08]What do I want to bring?
[161:01.04]Blue double SMG.
[161:04.52]That sounds fun to me.
[161:08.28]And... Grenade launcher.
[161:13.36]Sounds good.
[161:15.37]Don't need homing on it.
[161:18.91]These are just default.
[161:19.57]These are fine.
[161:21.35]Alright, let's go check it out.
[161:27.27]Alright, spooky mode just makes this really hard to navigate.
[161:31.84]Where's the stairs?
[161:33.18]Okay.
[161:40.96]Let's go.
[161:49.79]How come the voices aren't squeaky?
[161:53.15]There's no squeaky voices.
[161:54.17]That's what we've been waiting for.
[162:02.67]Probably just the enemies here.
[162:04.48]This was in the demo.
[162:05.48]This was in the demo.
[162:07.04]Spooky mode of turning off.
[162:10.12]Oh shit, that's not going to help us.
[162:33.64]Okay.
[162:33.86]Yeah.
[162:34.18]So I, this is cool.
[162:35.68]I just can't really see very well.
[162:42.76]Let's go for it.
[162:55.81]Who has the squeaky voice?
[162:58.91]Oh.
[163:03.30]Oh my, that hurts my ears.
[163:05.70]That hurts my ears.

[190:00.96]We need to see Big Head.
[190:05.08]OK.
[190:11.93]I just want to see the Big Head and then we'll take a quick break and then we'll look at the sunflowers.
[190:19.23]Heard Horizon bitching and crying over the cops.
[190:22.44]You sure pissed them off.
[190:30.49]Yeah, I don't need to do any outfitting or anything.
[190:32.79]Okay.
[190:40.22]Here's the oil rig.
[190:41.06]Everyone said, hey, do the oil rig when it's available.
[190:43.56]This is the last side mission.
[190:44.88]Let's go for it.
[190:49.11]I don't think I'm going to beat this one.
[190:52.07]I think I'll just check it out.
[190:52.99]I want to know why.
[191:00.70]I mean, I'm already in here, but as well.
[191:09.55]I should know.
[191:09.89]Let's do actual grenade grenades.
[191:18.51]I am alright with this.
[191:31.84]Let him game.
[191:42.42]Yeah, I'm just gaming.
[192:14.09]Oh, his head shrinks.
[192:20.01]OK, now it just feels like this is the mobile game they came out with.
[192:28.08]At the same time as a marketing tool, right?
[192:31.20]This is the mobile game.
[192:44.81]Okay, I'm dead.
[192:46.65]Alright.
[192:47.40]Alright, alright.
[192:47.88]Let's do the sunflowers.
[192:53.36]It's time.
[192:59.26]I'm going to take a quick break.
[193:01.32]I'm going to get them over here so I can put them on the screen.
[193:04.47]We will showcase the sunflowers.
[193:07.27]You have no idea what's going on.
[193:11.25]Pretty much every year.
[193:13.89]The last two or three years.
[193:14.89]Although, didn't do very much last year.
[193:18.23]But... It's been very, very, very hot.
[193:22.69]Sunflowers got a ton of sun this year.
[193:30.74]But, yeah.
[193:32.36]Holly and I planted a bunch of stuff.
[193:35.02]We've been very good plant parents.
[193:40.74]At least I hope so.
[193:42.95]Are they taller than you?
[193:44.35]Yeah, here's the thing.
[193:46.39]The last time we did this, we got ones that could go up to 8 to 12 feet, I think is what it was.
[193:55.72]These ones were only supposed to go, because it's like, maybe we'll do some smaller ones this year.
[194:01.42]These were supposed to only go 4 feet, and they're still 10 feet tall.
[194:09.13]These were not the big ones.
[194:12.15]It's just out here in Vegas, the sun just rains down all fucking day.
[194:18.79]They love it out here.
[194:23.28]They just absorb so many of these sun's rays.
[194:26.52]And we fertilize, you know, fertilize them.
[194:28.12]Alright, give me a minute.
[194:30.46]I'm going to get it set.
[194:31.46]I'll come back.
[194:31.82]We'll hang out for a little bit longer.
[194:33.94]And let's do some sunflowers.
[194:35.23]See you in like four or five minutes.
[194:37.79]I'm going to pee.
[194:38.19]I'm going to refill my drink.
[194:39.27]I'll be back.
[199:05.15]Okay, I am back.
[199:07.29]I'm going to put some nice music on while we sit here for like 15 minutes or so.
[199:11.93]Let me get some nice music.
[199:24.62]What should we do for nice music?
[199:26.18]What do you think?
[199:28.04]How about... Stardew?
[199:36.22]Oh, that's not a bad one.
[199:37.64]That's right.
[199:38.48]Alright.
[199:38.74]Stardew.
[199:39.12]We're going to go right in the middle somewhere.
[199:47.05]Stardew Valley OST.
[199:52.29]And there it is.
[199:53.07]Hey, there it is.
[200:00.07]I think that's a good start.
[200:06.70]Okay.
[200:08.89]So for those of you that are about to join me on the journey for this year's harvest.
[200:20.10]Okay.
[200:21.06]Let me figure out how I'm going to do this.
[200:24.97]How should I do this?
[200:31.99]I think I can just drag them over here.
[200:33.34]Yeah, this will work.
[200:34.96]Alright, so here is the... Here are the babies.
[200:45.03]As you can see.
[200:50.01]The thing about sunflowers and growing anything, it's actually kind of sad what you need to do.
[200:57.43]So, when you plant sunflower seeds, oh wait, it doesn't, whatever, you have like a, you know, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that this year.
[201:04.41]You have to thin out the ones that don't really make it.
[201:10.36]If you're going to do them in a pot, like if, let's just say, for instance, you don't have a bunch of land to do like 50 sunflowers in a row.
[201:19.45]You plant, they have to be at least eight inches apart, 12 inches apart.
[201:25.30]But sometimes as you see here, see the one on the left, that, that guy was ready and he was obviously the stronger one.
[201:35.80]So that was the one that was going to stick around.
[201:39.56]The other ones, unfortunately, they have to go.
[201:42.66]Purged.
[201:45.98]Yeah.
[201:47.56]And it's always like, no, but I'm going to put you in a different pot.
[201:52.96]And what ends up happening is you end up having, you end up kind of transferring all the ones that weren't going to make it to a different pot.
[202:02.23]So you just end up having a bunch of pots of these ones that kind of don't make it in quotes.
[202:06.33]You kind of just try to spread them around.
[202:10.79]These ones all lived, by the way.
[202:14.48]These were dwarf sunflowers.
[202:18.31]So I'll give you another picture here.
[202:19.69]It's the same group.
[202:27.33]As you can see the one in the back, a little bit, a little slow to, to, to rise, but all three of these made it.
[202:34.24]I think that's a pretty good one of them down here.
[202:40.86]There is.
[202:43.29]Yeah, so the big ones, the ones that we have in a big pot are here.
[202:50.10]Take a look at these ones.
[202:53.22]So that's how they start.
[202:56.71]Oh, hold on.
[203:02.47]What is this doing?
[203:06.79]There we go.
[203:09.88]They end up getting a little bigger.
[203:12.61]These ones are different, though.
[203:13.41]These ones are not the little ones.
[203:16.19]But yeah.
[203:19.01]Again, we went with three this year.
[203:21.79]They're very, very strong.
[203:22.99]Very healthy.
[203:26.65]They got to this stage pretty quickly.
[203:30.68]It was like, wow, they're growing really, really, really fast.
[203:35.88]We didn't just do sunflowers, though.
[203:41.82]God, gardening is so nice.
[203:45.48]Let me show you this.
[203:48.31]What do you think about this one?
[203:49.77]Alright.
[203:51.51]So those are sunflowers.
[203:53.53]Take a look at this one.
[203:56.27]Ooh.
[203:59.65]I don't even know.
[204:00.99]We don't even know what this flower is.
[204:03.39]We just know that it looks really nice and we want to make it look like a National Geographic photo.
[204:10.77]This is a wildflower.
[204:14.91]Don't even know what it is.
[204:17.47]Is it a tulip?
[204:19.05]I don't know.
[204:19.53]This opened.
[204:20.77]This opened wide.
[204:21.59]You'll see a couple pictures of it.
[204:24.07]This thing was open.
[204:26.23]Here's another one.
[204:26.75]Put them side by side here.
[204:33.17]So I believe this is the same area.
[204:35.73]There's a little moth on this too.
[204:41.47]Passy.
[204:43.29]There was a couple of orange ones.
[204:44.25]There was a few pink ones.
[204:44.99]There was some blue ones.
[204:45.73]They were all over the place.
[204:47.91]Oh no, there's a bug.
[204:52.14]Just getting some shade.
[204:54.16]There's a couple of really, really cute photos.
[205:02.55]Any more of the tall wildflowers?
[205:06.41]Yep, I got one here.
[205:08.89]So this is the one that you see on the right.
[205:11.53]Sorry, on the left.
[205:15.63]Looking through the jungle.
[205:20.76]Ooh.
[205:22.98]That's what it opened up into.
[205:25.22]So what is that?
[205:27.94]We don't really know what it is.
[205:29.70]Because the wildflower packets, you just shake it out.
[205:34.69]It's just a ton of different random things.
[205:39.03]It's a Cosmo.
[205:43.09]Cosmo.
[205:45.65]That's cool.
[205:48.39]It's opium.
[205:53.13]It's not.
[205:54.03]It's not opium.
[205:58.12]This dude's growing fucking opium.
[206:04.72]But I know what you're really here for.
[206:07.18]Right?
[206:08.82]You're here to see the fucking blue wildflower.
[206:13.42]Same pot.
[206:18.35]Yeah, same pot.
[206:20.51]And these just popped up kind of randomly.
[206:24.31]It was kind of cool to walk out here sometimes and be like, wait, there's a purple one now.
[206:28.16]That's kind of cool.
[206:35.98]Is there any?
[206:36.52]Let me see.
[206:42.21]Oh, here's a good one.
[206:43.15]So this is, this is right before one of the sunflowers opened.
[206:49.75]Take a look at that.
[206:53.55]So as you can probably see the color this year, we had, they were kind of yellow with brown in the middle and they opened like this, but then they got to be pretty much yellow.
[207:13.58]Let's see if we can get that one open.
[207:15.06]Okay, are you ready?
[207:17.20]So this is kind of... No, I don't want to show that one yet.
[207:22.48]We'll just show this one.
[207:23.20]We'll show it starting to open.
[207:25.49]So there's that one.
[207:26.35]Take a look at this.
[207:28.47]Aha!
[207:36.65]It is opening!
[207:37.49]So a really wild color.
[207:44.93]It was like electric in a way.
[207:54.70]It's so weird because, like I said, over time, these actually get paler.
[208:01.84]All that orange in the middle goes away almost completely.
[208:06.03]Just that's how they start for the first week.
[208:09.72]Do you grow them inside?
[208:11.50]No, no, these are all outside.
[208:13.68]They kind of have to be.
[208:14.28]They have to be in direct sun all day.
[208:17.85]I googled sunflower and found this on the second page, bro.
[208:22.47]Will you stop fucking with me?
[208:23.97]Come on.
[208:26.01]We didn't do sunflowers this year, okay?
[208:28.11]Fine.
[208:29.71]What do you want me to say?
[208:31.87]Don't get up in here and fuck it up for me.
[208:40.67]So yeah, I want to show you.
[208:44.75]Can I show you my favorite one?
[208:47.41]And this is a big deal, by the way.
[208:50.29]This is a big deal.
[208:52.91]A lot of times when you grow some flowers, you get yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.
[208:58.06]This year.
[209:01.86]We got a massive orange one.
[209:06.64]And it stayed orange the entire time it was here.
[209:10.68]Bright orange.
[209:11.70]Let me make it a little smaller.
[209:16.25]I love the depth of field, too.
[209:28.78]It looks so nice.
[209:30.32]And who's that?
[209:31.86]Oh!
[209:32.28]It's Otto!
[209:33.40]Oh!
[209:41.14]But yeah, this thing is the size... The middle there is as big as a fucking softball.
[209:47.88]This was almost two fists together.
[209:50.94]How big that middle is.
[209:52.80]It's gigantic.
[209:54.10]It's my favorite.
[209:56.54]I don't want to play favorites, but that's my favorite one this year.
[209:59.89]Just saying.
[210:01.35]It looks stunning.
[210:05.99]Here is one of the dwarf sunflowers open.
[210:10.49]Very pretty.
[210:15.29]And these only get to be, and a lot of people say, hey, this sounds like really fun.
[210:19.18]This sounds like really cool.
[210:20.26]I can't do that.
[210:22.14]These are like not even a foot tall.
[210:25.42]They're tiny.
[210:27.16]Actually, wait, this might not be the dwarf one.
[210:29.87]No, this is just one of the regular ones.
[210:33.39]See the other head forming on the left side there?
[210:37.25]Yeah, these were vibrant.
[210:40.03]Sunflowers are so easy.
[210:41.05]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[210:43.22]But as long as you, if you ever, let me learn to talk again.
[210:46.87]As long as you're in an area that gets a ton of sunshine throughout the entire summer season, you'll, it'll work.
[210:57.25]Sunflowers are pretty easy.
[211:00.06]And they just, they blow up sometimes.
[211:02.84]Remember I told you that one of them was a Hydra?
[211:06.32]We tried to get some decent pictures of just how many heads appeared on this thing.
[211:12.36]So let's see.
[211:12.74]Yeah, take a look at this.
[211:16.46]Are you ready?
[211:19.40]Check this shit out.
[211:21.87]So this is at full growth for the one that I was just showing you.
[211:30.35]It's like a fucking Elden Ring boss.
[211:37.49]There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[211:38.33]I believe there are 11 heads.
[211:48.39]It's just that they were facing the other way and it's just like, ah, shit.
[211:52.77]It's alright.
[211:54.19]It's okay.
[211:57.59]There's a pretty cool one here looking up here.
[211:59.77]This one too.
[212:04.69]This is taken from like the bottom looking up.
[212:10.32]This thing was huge.
[212:11.50]It was probably 10 feet tall.
[212:15.98]And there are heads that are still going to open.
[212:18.92]The photos are awesome.
[212:20.74]Yeah, this is Holly taking all of these pictures.
[212:24.88]I took one.
[212:25.62]Yeah, these are all Holly.
[212:33.22]They are very, very, very good.
[212:34.60]Alright, I'm going to show you something now that's going to make you cry.
[212:41.66]You're going to cry.
[212:43.36]Hope you're ready.
[212:44.94]You ready?
[212:47.78]You ready?
[212:49.28]I don't know if you're ready.
[212:56.36]It's a hummingbird drinking out of the big orange one.
[213:03.13]No big deal.
[213:11.15]Yes, we sat staring at these until one showed up.
[213:16.86]That was an entire afternoon at one point.
[213:27.90]We did get a couple of visitors.
[213:30.30]Speaking of visitors, it was really nice to see.
[213:33.20]I don't know, it makes you feel kind of good.
[213:35.92]So this is a wasp.
[213:38.58]And they would just kind of pop in from time to time.
[213:40.18]If you don't like wasps, then, you know, you're about to see one.
[213:46.22]But what I told you guys last week, I was like, man, when you really kind of just sit here and watch, you kind of go,
[213:54.18]they're just kind of hanging out so this was a wasp and this wasp found this piece of shade here because I told you it's been insanely hot it has been 100 plus 110 degrees every single day and this little uh this little guy found the shade and slept he literally is sleeping here he's lying down in the shade
[214:21.50]He found a little spot, and it's just like, it is too hot, man.
[214:27.81]Yeah, he's actually, like, lying down.
[214:31.19]Just staying out of the heat.
[214:39.48]Did he get up?
[214:40.16]Yeah.
[214:40.74]No, he's not dead.
[214:42.64]Nobody tell him.
[214:44.20]Nobody tell him he's dead.
[214:46.13]No, he got up and flew away like 20 minutes later.
[214:49.19]He's not dead.
[214:55.13]Nobody tell him.
[214:56.19]Nobody tell him.
[214:57.05]Nobody tell him.
[215:00.79]He got up and flew away literally 10 minutes later.
[215:03.03]It was like, oh, there he goes.
[215:04.57]Wow.
[215:05.22]He's still alive.
[215:06.44]Alright.
[215:06.80]He's not dead.
[215:08.70]Stop saying that.
[215:15.89]He's not dead!
[215:16.87]Oh yeah?
[215:20.87]What do you think about that, huh?
[215:27.08]We got visited by all kinds of creatures.
[215:29.68]Ladybugs.
[215:31.74]Lacewings.
[215:33.94]Bumblebees.
[215:35.64]Honeybees.
[215:38.57]And these are awesome because these eat all the aphids.
[215:42.37]Something I never knew before doing plants and gardening, whatever.
[215:46.71]There is an entire group of animal that just spawns a hundred million times out of fucking nowhere and eats everything that is green.
[216:01.24]It doesn't even make any sense where they come from.
[216:05.68]Lacewings eat them.
[216:07.62]Ladybugs eat them.
[216:09.82]And it was actually pretty under control this year.
[216:14.06]I'm glad that the ecosystem kind of could do it.
[216:17.50]You should go outside and paint yourself green.
[216:22.89]Why?
[216:23.63]What are you... Time that.
[216:25.63]Time that person out.
[216:27.41]For, like, at least five minutes.
[216:29.29]Hey, dude, can you go outside and paint yourself green?
[216:35.67]Like, what, and pretend to be a flower?
[216:41.86]Ants farm them.
[216:42.66]Yeah.
[216:43.58]Ants?
[216:44.96]want the- the delicious juice that they, um, secrete.
[216:49.65]So ants will farm them.
[216:51.55]Ants will literally turn them into, like, these pr- they just produce this liquid that the ants want, so the ants bring them there on purpose.
[216:59.82]And just turn them into bug fucking, like, workers.
[217:04.32]They- they essentially have, like, it's like- it's like slavery.
[217:06.78]It's crazy.
[217:07.84]It's fucked up.
[217:09.60]They literally take these aphids and, like, make them- it's fucking crazy.
[217:16.02]It's actually insane.
[217:17.55]If you look into it, go watch or read anything about what ants do to aphids.
[217:22.17]It's like... Huh?
[217:26.27]What are you talking about?
[217:27.79]No, they don't do that.
[217:29.59]Yeah, they do.
[217:30.18]It's fucked up.
[217:37.46]Farmer ants?
[217:39.10]Bug...
[217:44.77]The aphids get protection from the ants?
[217:48.69]I was under the impression that they kind of were just like, you go up there and do this and we're gonna take your, like, food from you.
[217:54.18]It's like, it's kind of, it's kind of, is it mutually beneficial?
[218:00.56]It's kind of like cattle.
[218:04.50]It's like livestock.
[218:06.36]Yeah.
[218:09.06]Ants farm them, it's fucked up.
[218:13.07]Well, we're looking at a cute wasp sleeping on a leaf and a ladybug.
[218:17.14]Okay?
[218:19.90]Speaking of the other plants... These are... I showed you the... Well, I actually didn't even see them.
[218:29.45]This is a good one, though.
[218:29.99]The marigolds.
[218:30.97]Everything was orange this year.
[218:33.17]These are marigolds.
[218:35.35]And the reason why these are here is because they help actually deter...
[218:40.37]Which I know the book is kind of out on this, but according to some people, marigolds actually repel a lot of insects.
[218:50.70]They hate them.
[218:51.48]They don't like the way they smell.
[218:54.59]So this is a little popcorn marigold.
[218:58.03]They're good ground cover, yeah.
[219:02.45]Do bugs use neti pots?
[219:05.40]Uh...
[219:06.91]don't think so but over here look look at that out of focus but there's one of the see how small they are that's one of the dwarf sunflowers that you saw before and you see one two three remember in the very beginning that's them so we did end up pulling them out and putting them in individual pots and they were very happy they did very well
[219:36.50]There's also, there's like a couple more I want to show.
[219:38.94]Let me see.
[219:46.83]Oh, this one's cool.
[219:48.71]This is another one kind of like looking up at the big hydra.
[219:53.95]The sense of scale is hard to show, but this thing is about 10 feet tall.
[219:57.28]And no, I'm not going to stand next to it because I know a lot of people would just like shrink me and make me like four and a half feet tall.
[220:10.52]Let's show... Ooh, this one.
[220:12.86]Oh, yeah.
[220:13.28]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[220:14.12]Take a look at this one.
[220:14.70]Remember that hummingbird you saw earlier?
[220:16.06]Yep.
[220:22.44]Look at how majestic she is.
[220:27.26]Yeah, they were all about this.
[220:28.56]They were all over these.
[220:36.75]And we'll show... How many more do we have?
[220:42.91]I think I could show this one too.
[220:44.75]It's actually kind of cool just to see them closed.
[220:48.02]So for instance, this one here.
[220:48.90]Let me put this one back.
[220:52.54]Where did it go?
[220:57.11]Yeah, I'll put this one back up.
[220:59.95]It's so weird because before these open.
[221:05.03]It's almost like there's magic going on in here.
[221:08.05]Because the head is closed, it stays closed pretty tightly, and then just one day, you can start to see color in there, and then a day or two later, the whole thing is open.
[221:20.06]It's so weird that it does that.
[221:23.68]And then a few weeks after this, it generates hundreds of seeds,
[221:31.96]That you then can eat.
[221:34.60]Or just plant in the ground again.
[221:37.41]Plants are ridiculous.
[221:38.65]Nature is insane.
[221:41.03]How long from start to finish?
[221:43.01]The first picture is here.
[221:44.17]For instance, these ones here.
[221:47.33]This was... I want to say... Because you're supposed to plant them a week or so after there is no chance of a frost.
[221:56.51]Because it destroys them.
[221:59.67]So once you're past the last frost of the year, so sometimes that's like May, sometimes it's mid May, early May, sometimes it's late May.
[222:12.24]It really depends on where you are.
[222:14.10]But for us, uh, it was pretty early in May.
[222:18.18]So this is probably, I want to say like a month and a half of growth.
[222:21.74]Maybe as of these photos, probably like a month, like four to six weeks, I want to say.
[222:30.56]Yeah, so May 6th is when we put them in the ground.
[222:37.49]Or May 9th, maybe.
[222:41.79]And then you're seeing these photos as of like a month or so later.
[222:50.20]Where are their faces?
[222:51.70]Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
[222:53.00]It's so crazy that this thing right... This piece of fucking lettuce right here develops this on its head.
[223:02.93]That's just... It does?
[223:04.25]Like, that's so wild that this actually does this.
[223:09.78]Hey.
[223:10.92]Well, I'm just... I mean, look at it.
[223:12.44]It kind of looks like a piece of romaine lettuce.
[223:17.36]And then just one day after getting a lot of nutrients and sun and water, it turns into this.
[223:26.10]Let me get that orange one back up.
[223:34.01]This thing was rocking for like a week or two straight.
[223:36.09]I think somebody said, would you ever do vegetables?
[223:44.65]Vegetables kind of scare me.
[223:46.69]Because... Well, I mean, sunflowers are technically food.
[223:52.63]Technically.
[223:59.17]But the thing about vegetables that freaks me out is I almost feel like...
[224:05.18]I would... I don't know.
[224:06.52]I feel like it's... Am I watering them enough?
[224:08.52]Are they gonna taste okay?
[224:10.03]What about the water?
[224:10.99]Is the water... Am I using like... Should I use like purified water?
[224:14.47]What if it's gonna be like gross... Water in there?
[224:18.19]What's the pH of this water?
[224:19.47]I don't know.
[224:19.75]I feel like I'd freak out about it.
[224:20.70]You should grow tomatoes.
[224:27.42]What actually does well in Vegas?
[224:30.11]I always felt like that anything that wasn't something that needs to get scorched by the sun just can't really work out here.
[224:37.87]Sunflowers work out here.
[224:39.54]Would tomatoes work?
[224:40.42]I feel like tomatoes would just get burnt.
[224:52.77]Money trees?
[224:55.42]Well, money tree, uh... Can you eat a money tree?
[224:57.73]I feel like that's kind of weird.
[225:00.23]I don't think I'd want to eat a money tree.
[225:01.39]You're supposed to have it for, like, good luck.
[225:03.55]I feel like eating it is bad luck.
[225:12.75]Dragon fruit, peppers, and... So a dragon fruit would do well out here?
[225:16.46]That sounds actually kind of fun.
[225:21.38]Holy shit, you can actually grow pumpkins.
[225:23.66]Really?
[225:23.88]Really?
[225:28.16]It was just a joke.
[225:28.82]I didn't even know money trees were real.
[225:34.72]What?
[225:38.30]Succulents?
[225:40.98]I actually think... I think that would be... Yeah, that'd be really... Because... I mean, there's a lot of cactus out here.
[225:48.66]Just naturally.
[225:50.58]It's kind of everywhere.
[225:52.72]Did you use fertilizer?
[225:53.80]Yeah, just the generic stuff.
[225:57.20]Just that, you know, the bag you get at Home Depot that has, you know, you can just sprinkle it in and rinse it in there.
[226:03.68]It's pretty, pretty basic stuff.
[226:10.04]Every two or three weeks, drop it in there.
[226:12.20]We only did it, I want to say, maybe three or four times total.
[226:17.25]So every two weeks.
[226:20.77]Prickly pear.
[226:21.51]Oh yeah.
[226:25.59]What the fuck is this stream?
[226:28.65]It's in the title.
[226:30.21]It literally says trepangtu and sunflower podcast.
[226:41.20]Throw some peppermint.
[226:44.02]Should grow aloe for the skincare.
[226:46.36]That's true.
[226:53.10]Ban that guy?
[226:54.14]Nah, it's alright.
[226:58.58]Would you get some creatures for the garden?
[227:02.62]We get a lot of... They just kind of show up.
[227:08.62]Last time there was praying mantis.
[227:10.58]There were honeybees.
[227:12.44]If you have this stuff, they kind of just show up on their own.
[227:15.90]You don't really have to do very much.
[227:21.68]Just like jump scared you.
[227:22.46]I'm sorry.
[227:23.88]Sometimes, oh, you know, I need shade.
[227:26.98]I'm going to hang out here.
[227:37.15]Hummingbirds are so cool.
[227:39.97]Can I tell you?
[227:40.67]Hummingbirds are my new favorite animal.
[227:44.61]They're just so interesting.
[227:46.75]I can't even describe how... Let me just tell you, they're great.
[227:53.90]Hummingbird feeders.
[227:54.66]Do you have hummingbird feeders?
[227:56.96]I sure do.
[227:57.68]We sure do.
[227:59.66]They're... That's essentially what these are.
[228:05.53]They are hummingbird feeders.
[228:11.25]That's kind of one of the points to do it in the first place.
[228:21.52]Yeah, that's probably it.
[228:24.38]That's pretty much it.
[228:29.62]Got to go over a bunch of them.
[228:32.17]I think there's a few more that we have that are really big close-ups.
[228:35.91]Especially after we harvested some of them.
[228:40.21]So, we can... If you want to see... Hold on.
[228:43.94]Did I show... I'll show this one, too.
[228:46.28]So, this one... Oh, no.
[228:49.14]We already saw that one.
[228:51.90]We already saw that one.
[228:52.62]Okay.
[228:57.07]This one looks...
[228:59.42]Oh, this is a good one.
[229:00.76]Take a look at this one.
[229:02.23]So, this is sort of how they were set near each other.
[229:05.73]You're wondering, just kind of in placement, like, wait, where's that orange one?
[229:08.91]So, there's the Hydra, and there's the orange one.
[229:12.24]And, as you see, see the one in the middle on the right?
[229:17.38]That one is ready for harvest.
[229:20.48]You essentially, once they're ready, you snip off the head...
[229:25.76]And there it is.
[229:26.66]And there's your seeds in there.
[229:27.92]You just kind of fish them out.
[229:29.46]Yeah, you can see the color difference now too.
[229:36.42]Much better.
[229:39.44]That sort of sprinkled in orange brown on the right one.
[229:43.20]The one on the left is like fire orange.
[229:49.09]Do you cook them?
[229:51.41]No.
[229:51.75]No.
[229:54.76]For the most part, it's more of, I want to keep these because I want to plant these ones next year.
[230:04.69]So you kind of keep the family.
[230:07.89]Now there's hundreds of them.
[230:09.33]So yeah, you could cook them, you could toast them up and eat them if you really wanted to.
[230:12.09]Take them out of the shells, toast them up.
[230:15.93]Yeah.
[230:21.67]There you go.
[230:23.35]There are the sunflowers.
[230:24.61]There's your big, fiery orange sunflower.
[230:29.09]And then the family of 11 heads.
[230:34.15]It was wild this year.
[230:38.46]Cool.
[230:42.14]You need to name them?
[230:44.86]The one on the left is Blaze.
[230:47.76]Come on.
[230:49.80]And the one on the right is Cerberus.
[230:52.30]You don't think we've already gone over this?
[230:54.88]Many, many times?
[231:07.23]Where's Otto?
[231:08.65]He's right here.
[231:12.74]He didn't see?
[231:30.55]Alright.
[231:31.37]That's going to wrap it up.
[231:35.69]Short stream today, but you know, there'll be a lot more of these.
[231:39.37]I had fun.
[231:43.92]It was a good day.
[231:46.52]The next time I see you, here is the plan.
[231:48.66]Sunday, we are going to do Team Fortress 2.
[231:52.10]I got to say it again.
[231:52.92]Make sure you clear your ears out a little and go, wait, what did he just say?
[231:58.14]Team Fortress 2 on Sunday.
[232:01.26]I'm going to play for an hour or two, see how I like it, see if I'm getting into it again.
[232:09.08]And then after that, probably start Viewfinder.
[232:12.95]Play that for a couple of hours.
[232:16.96]That's the plan for Sunday.
[232:21.33]Hey, a botanist here.
[232:23.69]Ooh, hold on.
[232:24.93]Some fun info about sunflowers is each place that bears a seed is a singular flower.
[232:31.03]Each head houses hundreds of singular flowers.
[232:34.91]Two different kinds, too.
[232:36.79]Disk flowers and ray flowers.
[232:39.27]The middle flowers are the disk ones, and the ones along the rim are ray flowers.
[232:44.96]Each ray flower has a huge petal.
[232:47.66]Yeah, they're all into that.
[232:48.40]That's wild.
[232:51.68]We have botanists here.
[232:52.60]We have scientists here.
[232:53.52]We have doctors here.
[232:54.38]We have lawyers.
[232:59.06]Most educated community.
[233:02.21]On Earth, by the way.
[233:03.09]On Earth, I said.
[233:07.21]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[233:08.61]Thanks for watching.
[233:10.01]See you Sunday.
[233:10.49]Probably starting around the same time, around 3 o'clock.
[233:19.45]Hope you enjoyed the sunflowers.
[233:20.90]It was about a month and a half to get them there.
[233:24.88]Marigolds.
[233:26.74]The wildflowers.
[233:32.06]They're still around too.
[233:32.70]I'll probably show a couple more pictures later.
[233:34.46]Because the wildflowers are still going strong.
[233:39.93]There's a few more heads that are going to open on the orange one.
[233:41.83]Maybe we'll do an update in another week or so.
[233:49.54]Yeah, see you guys on Sunday around three o'clock.
[233:52.78]Take care of yourselves.
[233:53.70]Thanks for hanging out.
[233:55.30]Trip Hang 2 is, I would think that's probably one of the most fun games I've played this year.
[233:59.64]If you want a real assessment of that, that's probably up there in the top five games I've played this year.
[234:05.53]It was just very fun.
[234:09.05]You can challenge yourself like crazy in that game and it's really interesting.
[234:11.93]You can go as hard or as easy as you want.
[234:14.41]I thought it was great.
[234:16.10]I would say that's, yeah, it was very good.
[234:22.74]Dude, you've only played like six games.
[234:25.83]Yeah.
[234:27.15]That's in the top five.
[234:29.57]What's the one game that came out this year that I played that I've really despised, apparently?
[234:36.36]I don't know.
[234:38.04]What have I not mentioned?
[234:39.36]Gollum?
[234:39.94]Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[234:42.95]Diablo 4.
[234:46.00]Yeah, I didn't really talk about it, did I?
[234:48.41]No.
[234:49.99]Yeah, we don't need to get into it.
[234:51.25]We don't need to get... We don't need to get into it.
[234:53.23]You know what I'm saying?
[234:54.71]We don't need to get into it.
[234:56.13]I'll be here for another six hours.
[234:58.31]We're not going to get into it.
[234:59.09]I'll be here for six more hours.
[235:09.92]Get into it.
[235:12.60]I'll see you Sunday.
[235:13.92]Maybe one day I'll get into it.
[235:18.29]When are you going to do the browser game and quiz stream?
[235:24.13]That's true.
[235:25.51]We do need to do that.
[235:27.59]We'll do it soon.
[235:29.35]Sorcery part four also as well.
[235:34.95]Dude, start ranting now.
[235:38.64]No, we just showed off all the sunflowers.
[235:41.42]I'm in a really good mood.
[235:44.67]I don't want to get into it.
[235:46.03]Because then I'll get all hot.
[235:48.27]The room will heat up.
[235:49.87]I'll have to go get a bunch more water.
[235:52.36]I'll be pacing back and forth for the next hour off stream.
[235:55.94]Thinking about it.
[235:58.50]I gotta log off.
[236:00.50]Let's log off for a little while.
[236:07.20]Hey, say happy birthday to my cat Goober.
[236:09.26]He turned one today.
[236:12.07]Happy birthday, Goober.
[236:13.94]The cat.
[236:14.38]Alright, I'll see you guys Sunday.
[236:20.78]Take care of yourselves.
[236:21.46]Call your mother, call your father.
[236:25.07]Hey, do something nice for yourself today.
[236:27.13]Do something nice for yourself today.
[236:30.29]You understand?
[236:31.99]Hey!
[236:34.51]Do something nice for yourself today.
[236:40.27]See you guys later.
[236:41.47]Take care.
[236:41.93]See you Sunday.
[236:44.00]Have a great one.
[236:44.46]Bye.
[237:25.60]I'm also going to wait till 4 hours so it looks much better on paper.
[237:35.86]You know how it is.
[237:39.08]It just like you know 4 hours looks just on paper looks a lot better.
[237:41.94]I got just enough time to talk about D4 and I get it out in two minutes.
[237:50.50]Alright, let's get into it.
[237:51.44]I'm gonna get into it.
[237:53.42]I got two minutes.
[238:01.62]I can't get it.
[238:02.64]I can't get into it.
[238:03.50]I can't get into it.
[238:05.36]It's like a whole, I have like a whole, I'm like, there's a whole thing about like modern video games and how it's almost like things are being, they're not being made.
[238:13.39]No, I can't get into it.
[238:16.81]We have two minutes.
[238:17.55]I actually can't get into it.
[238:28.34]I'm just picking up Saigon's boots fucking eight times.
[238:31.32]And that's the only item that drops.
[238:32.95]There's something going on there.
[238:35.29]You know what I mean?
[238:36.25]Or like, you know, distant enemies are stunned for four seconds for the 15th time as an aspect.
[238:41.43]I just don't like this.
[238:42.31]It doesn't do it for me at all.
[238:43.73]That just doesn't do it for me at all.
[238:45.24]This doesn't do it for me at all.
[238:54.54]Go off.
[238:54.94]Go off.
[238:55.22]Log off.
[238:55.74]I'm going off.
[238:58.80]I'm going off.
[238:59.30]Alright.
[239:01.58]Holy shit, dude.
[239:02.54]Wow.
[239:02.92]Super hot take.
[239:03.86]Oh, wow, dude.
[239:05.39]Did you hear that?
[239:06.51]No way.
[239:07.31]Nobody else has that take.
[239:09.13]Only Germino says that.
[239:11.17]Whoa, dude.
[239:11.91]He's so brave for giving his take on Dio.
[239:14.79]Dude, no one else has said.
[239:15.85]There's not like six or seven million people that have all said that exact same thing.
[239:21.11]Dude, you are.
[239:21.77]You are.
[239:22.81]Whoa.
[239:25.53]You are a visionary, by the way.
[239:34.02]We're almost at 4 hours, we're good.
[239:36.32]These are CCO takes.
[239:53.02]I like how Diablo 1 just had sword.
[239:57.70]I don't know.
[239:58.98]I just feel like I was working.
[240:02.78]Does that make sense?
[240:03.56]I feel like I was working when I was playing.
