[00:01.39]Hold on.
[00:02.27]I didn't even... I can't even clear my throat.
[00:06.97]Kazzy just gave 10 community subs.
[00:10.37]I just barely cleared my throat.
[00:12.53]And I saw it.
[00:13.01]I was just choked on my throat.
[00:19.48]Thank you, Kazzy.
[00:21.00]For the 10 subs.
[00:24.10]Congratulations to all of you that got one.
[00:25.52]Now you can spam jermaMoon.
[00:28.38]Like I do.
[00:32.06]I think I've only done jermaMoon like three times in the last year.
[00:36.61]Can anybody, is there like data on that?
[00:38.27]When was the last time I did jermaMoon?
[00:39.87]One of you guys has like the data somewhere.
[00:47.61]Wait, wait, what did I say?
[00:49.53]Like, ten times?
[00:51.49]No, I'm not going to type that all out.
[00:53.45]I'm not like you guys.
[00:54.19]I don't have... I don't have, like, keywords for... I don't have, like, keystrokes.
[01:01.44]Keymapped.
[01:02.88]I don't do any of that.
[01:03.84]I type it out.
[01:05.34]I actually physically type out, like, jermaMoon.
[01:09.00]And then I copy it and paste it.
[01:17.88]Me too.
[01:18.78]I'm not the only one?
[01:19.54]Good.
[01:21.24]But hope you're having a good day.
[01:22.94]Welcome back.
[01:23.38]If you were here last night, good morning.
[01:30.39]But it's almost 4 o'clock, so it's not the morning anymore.
[01:33.47]But anyways, how are you?
[01:35.69]We're gonna do some DOS tonight.
[01:40.71]Pick back up, because I really do enjoy this so much.
[01:46.19]Playing these DOS games is seriously, like, one of my... It's one of my, like, most favorite things to add to the stream.
[01:52.58]I... I get energy off of this shit.
[01:56.68]I, like, live off of these old fucked up games.
[02:08.37]How am I feeling?
[02:08.81]I'm feeling pretty good.
[02:11.63]And then tomorrow, we're gonna do Terraria again.
[02:15.42]Mr. Star is gonna boot his server back up.
[02:19.34]And we're gonna kind of pick up where we left off there.
[02:25.35]And then Sunday... I have not decided what's gonna happen on Sunday, but I'm probably not gonna stream.
[02:31.07]Because I have to leave.
[02:37.30]I have to really get ready.
[02:39.28]Because it's a very important trip early next week.
[02:47.12]Leave?
[02:47.84]Leave!
[02:57.05]He's going to Texas.
[02:58.35]No, Texas.
[02:59.43]No.
[03:01.03]For those of you that were not here yesterday, I will go briefly.
[03:04.93]And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I gotta make one of those exclamation point carnival.
[03:10.15]Just so I can have like a clip of me talking about it.
[03:12.17]Remember when I was moving to Vegas?
[03:18.26]Alright, somebody clip this.
[03:19.24]Ready?
[03:22.05]I'm gonna kill the audio here.
[03:23.73]Hold on.
[03:27.08]I'm gonna get this in one shot.
[03:31.16]Hey, you clicked this because you're probably wondering why somebody wrote hashtag carnival in the stream chat.
[03:36.80]Let me tell you.
[03:37.84]September 21st is the carnival stream.
[03:42.21]The carnival stream, you know, the one that I talked about previously of you guys controlling Twitch-controlled robots to play all kinds of fun Midway games and carnival games, including dunking me in a dunk tank.
[03:52.05]That's right.
[03:54.15]You ruined it.
[04:02.16]Yeah, you gave $50!
[04:07.64]That was going so well!
[04:09.32]And then I... Oh, you guys didn't hear the sound.
[04:10.92]I did.
[04:13.32]There's not even any message here.
[04:18.17]I said hashtag?
[04:19.07]Oh, fuck.
[04:20.51]But all jokes aside, that was Mandum Requiem.
[04:24.65]$50, thank you so much.
[04:28.06]$50 you cut me off.
[04:29.89]But I will take a $50 cutoff.
[04:34.05]Because that's an insane amount of money.
[04:35.29]Thank you.
[04:39.50]The clip is fucked up now.
[04:41.78]Here we go.
[04:42.14]I'll give you like an easy one.
[04:45.68]Ahem.
[04:50.03]September 21st 2019 is a day for you to remember that's the set in stone carnival stream date the one where you're gonna have fun with robots at a Twitch controlled carnival stream that's right you're gonna be in control September 21st 2019. maybe we'll see you there
[05:12.46]And up until then, I'm going to be traveling back and forth to a different state to make sure I get this thing hammered down completely.
[05:20.52]So you might see streams pulled back.
[05:22.20]You might see streams canceled up until the 21st.
[05:25.54]But you'll know in advance.
[05:26.62]Don't worry about that.
[05:29.45]I'm working on it.
[05:30.19]I'm working on it.
[05:31.29]And I'm putting time into it.
[05:33.67]Thank you for listening.
[05:34.39]Alright.
[05:35.53]There you go.
[05:36.31]I don't care.
[05:36.83]Just use that one.
[05:42.45]I'm not gonna redo that one, that one was fine.
[05:46.82]This is not the Vegas one again.
[05:48.28]I just used the first one, and just like, cut it.
[05:58.16]He's doing the Disneyland safety guide voice.
[06:01.43]Yeah.
[06:02.27]That's the voice acting voice.
[06:09.42]Make sure to keep your arms and hands inside the vehicle and by any means do not get out of the ride.
[06:16.74]Do not take any photos with flash photography and do not take off your shoes.
[06:22.68]Too many people been doing that lately.
[06:25.34]Keep them on.
[06:27.98]This is not a red eye from Boston to LA.
[06:42.50]Alright, anyways.
[06:44.34]Hey, look at that.
[06:45.09]Look what's on the screen right now.
[06:47.99]Well, not right now.
[06:50.11]In a second.
[06:53.39]Hold on.
[06:53.87]Just wait.
[06:54.97]You'll see it.
[06:58.53]No, you know, fuck it.
[07:00.13]No, no, no, no.
[07:00.89]Fuck it.
[07:01.09]We're just going to open up this one.
[07:05.20]Yeah.
[07:06.40]Here we go.
[07:06.96]We're going to open... This is streamer's choice.
[07:08.66]Remember, the last couple times we've done this, it's been streamer's choice.
[07:12.78]Streamer's choice is going to be Tubin.
[07:15.58]You heard it here first.
[07:20.85]Tubin.
[07:25.99]Alright, you can open your eyes now.
[07:28.36]Tubin.
[07:29.98]Published by Dumark.
[07:31.78]Limited IBM version.
[07:33.44]Written by Hank Gecko.
[07:36.58]Okay.
[07:37.28]VGA.
[07:37.40]VGA.
[07:53.75]This is the song.
[07:55.95]Cut it, cut it, cut it.
[07:58.67]This is the song that in my mind is what it sounds like when your computer gets a virus.
[08:06.80]Okay.
[08:09.44]I need to turn this down.
[08:13.34]No, I don't.
[08:16.20]How do I just go?
[08:17.56]Alright, there we go, we're fine.
[08:22.97]Tubin'!
[08:24.21]I fo- is this an arcade game?
[08:30.08]How do I move?
[08:31.52]W-A-S-D?
[08:34.64]Hey, what did I tell you about keeping your shoes on?
[08:37.20]How do I move?
[08:39.49]J-K-O V-D-B M Space
[08:47.66]Q. Okay, Q is turn.
[08:50.10]Q, okay, I tilted my body a little bit.
[08:52.50]I'm just like in the lazy river.
[08:56.87]Oh, those are beers!
[08:58.03]I think those are like beer cans.
[09:00.49]Alright, hold on.
[09:01.49]A is turn.
[09:05.59]S, maybe?
[09:06.05]Hold S. Oh, okay, I'm dead.
[09:18.94]I have to paddle.
[09:23.77]Oh my god, I actually do.
[09:25.37]Throw the beer can at it!
[09:43.89]This is so sloppy.
[09:47.15]Um... Why am I going this fast?
[09:50.89]They did this shit in Super Mario RPG.
[09:53.79]That's where they got it from.
[09:55.07]I remember this exact thing happening in Mario RPG.
[10:02.12]Uh, guys, you have to hold it.
[10:03.10]You don't have to tap it.
[10:03.72]You just hold it.
[10:06.64]Okay, quit fishing!
[10:09.04]Oh, come on!
[10:14.97]Come on, let me like throw like a beer can at a fisherman.
[10:21.07]That's so fucking stupid.
[10:25.15]What a menace to society this guy actually is.
[10:27.51]That guy didn't bring any safety equipment.
[10:36.69]I love how it stretches out a little more.
[10:42.55]Those fish.
[10:48.99]Thousand points.
[10:55.59]I got him.
[10:57.64]How do I get to the end?
[10:58.38]Alright, I gotta stay up front.
[11:03.90]That's how you win these ones.
[11:10.84]Oh my god.
[11:17.79]Okay, that was kind of scary.
[11:19.61]You can get eaten by an alligator?
[11:25.45]Okay.
[11:26.47]That was called tubing.
[11:28.09]You are a top shot tube dude.
[11:30.09]Enter your initials.
[11:36.76]Pretty good.
[11:37.28]Top shot tube dude.
[11:43.16]Biff.
[11:46.11]Well, that was that one.
[11:48.07]We're gonna move on from this one.
[11:50.13]I don't know.
[11:50.43]This one might take us a while.
[11:51.49]I don't know.
[11:51.93]I saw it.
[11:52.31]I remember Guts Framer's choice to start this out.
[11:56.60]This one.
[11:59.02]I've never played it, but some of you probably have.
[12:11.21]Another virus song.
[12:17.35]Oh shit, this is gonna be complicated.
[12:22.00]I thought you just had to, like, diagnose somebody.
[12:24.16]This is too complicated.
[12:25.02]Yeah, we're gonna have to sit here for, like, an hour to do a tutorial.
[12:32.98]Wait, what?
[12:39.90]As a carpool passenger, you relax and daydream your way to work.
[12:43.56]Then reality in the form of a truck smacks into you.
[12:45.81]You're not seriously hurt, but you go to the hospital.
[12:48.73]Wait, I'm the patient?
[12:52.83]You spend hours in a waiting room.
[12:55.48]You fill out a thousand forms.
[12:56.84]You finally see it.
[12:57.58]Don't wait.
[12:57.98]After I got in a car accident?
[12:59.56]You're poked, prodded, and rushed through the system.
[13:02.04]They take blood, run tests, and send you away.
[13:03.62]You feel mistreated and out of control.
[13:05.86]Time goes by.
[13:06.40]Your bruises heal.
[13:07.80]You put the whole experience behind you and then the bill shows up.
[13:09.89]What did they do?
[13:11.19]Who said they could do that?
[13:12.13]Shouldn't insurance cover this?
[13:14.33]Enough is enough.
[13:14.83]You decide to run for public office on the platform of healthcare reform.
[13:19.05]Click the small box in the upper left of this window to continue.
[13:25.73]Okay.
[13:26.09]Am I alive?
[13:31.96]I thought this was SimHealth.
[13:36.50]How do I turn this off?
[13:42.11]Hold on, I gotta turn this off.
[13:47.77]It's like specifically designed to hurt your ears.
[13:52.39]Before you can be elected to office, the voters need to know who you are, what you stand for, what you believe in, your personal values.
[13:58.85]I thought this was a surgery game.
[14:01.93]The values window will show you a number of statements.
[14:05.42]You rate how much you agree or disagree with each statement.
[14:08.42]From your answers, SimHealth will establish your personal values.
[14:14.02]Why is this game like 30 years ago and like 30 years in the future?
[14:23.55]This is some weird shit here.
[14:24.73]Okay.
[14:26.27]Your constituents and the simulation will judge you, not by the values you select, but how well you stick to them.
[14:33.67]Okay.
[14:37.66]Why?
[14:38.20]Wait, why?
[14:38.98]I thought this was a health game.
[14:43.88]SimHealth defines personal values as a balance between four ideals.
[14:48.16]Liberty, equality, community, and efficiency.
[14:53.50]Okay.
[14:56.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:58.57]Alright.
[14:59.69]Individually, each of these four ideals sounds great, but you can't have it all.
[15:03.71]Completely supporting anyone takes away from the others.
[15:08.43]So I got hit by a truck and decided to run for president?
[15:13.59]Is that what happened?
[15:18.23]Okay.
[15:19.58]Liberty and equality are at the opposite poles.
[15:21.22]The more liberty you have, the less equality.
[15:23.24]Community and efficiency are also opposing forces.
[15:25.84]As you choose your values, consider how the four different ideals can work together.
[15:32.58]Okay.
[15:36.06]Now what?
[15:37.64]You have represented with four conditions.
[15:40.89]Oh, God.
[15:41.59]No, you're not going to do... I'm not going to play the Saw game right now.
[15:49.61]You have four choices, each one describing four crisis points.
[15:54.31]Make your choice.
[15:56.24]I don't know if I want to do this.
[15:59.86]In the first room is a man who's just like you, was hit by a car.
[16:07.30]Choosing him removes both of his legs.
[16:10.97]In the other room, two families, one of which
[16:19.12]shit the bed last night what are you what make no choice I don't I'm not doing this like yeah that joke was ruined because I couldn't come up with like a safe way to have to have you press the button on the family you know what I mean like I I had to abort that one there's no like there's no way I could I could have turned that around
[16:56.25]I had to get away from that one.
[16:58.40]Alright, anyways, let's go.
[17:01.74]I'll do one.
[17:25.90]I'm fucking out of this.
[17:27.42]I'm not doing this.
[17:35.98]I'm not exploring the United States healthcare system.
[17:43.04]Ow.
[17:44.26]Alright, three point basketball.
[17:50.46]Willy, wait, was that the Willy Wonka song?
[17:54.21]Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka, the famous chocolatier.
[17:58.49]Hey!
[18:05.06]This is the same song!
[18:27.98]This is binaural beats in my fucking head.
[18:42.23]Mr. Three.
[18:42.95]The Bomber.
[18:44.27]Deadeye.
[18:45.17]Mr. Three.
[18:46.21]Don't get skill level one.
[18:49.60]Moving target?
[18:50.38]Yeah.
[18:51.34]PSPS.
[18:54.06]Hello, and welcome to the All-Star Basketball Association's three-point shooting championship.
[18:59.16]I'm Skip Smiley.
[19:00.63]The world's best shooters are here to settle once and for all.
[19:03.47]That guy on the right can't believe he's on camera.
[19:05.55]The winner will have his name engraved on the championship trophy alongside the name of last year's champ.
[19:11.87]Okay, that guy clearly didn't have any lines.
[19:14.18]That guy won the contest to be on stage with the guy that people think is cool.
[19:19.34]Alright, here we go.
[19:25.67]Joining me is the ever-exciting Rick Vitality.
[19:29.15]He will be giving us expert analysis as the championship goes on.
[19:33.39]Glad to be here, Skip.
[19:34.81]It's going to be three-point city, baby.
[19:37.47]Without any further ado, let's have a look at this year's field.
[19:41.07]Same guy.
[19:42.17]That's the same guy, except here's the thing.
[19:43.99]I've got to show this on camera.
[19:45.61]Same guy, except the one difference is he turned his mouth to the side.
[19:49.99]That's it.
[19:51.51]You go from this to this.
[19:52.83]All you have to do is just turn your mouth.
[19:55.02]That's it.
[19:56.87]Just like tilt your mouth and talk out of the side of your mouth.
[19:59.16]Oh, I didn't turn the face cam on.
[20:03.01]Whoops.
[20:08.08]Oh well.
[20:13.01]That looks like a strong field to me.
[20:15.23]What do you think, Rick?
[20:16.57]This is going to be an exciting tournament.
[20:18.87]We should see some fantastic shooting.
[20:21.49]Any predictions for the first round, Rick?
[20:23.67]Barkler might as well pack his bags.
[20:27.01]Admiral, the second round bound, baby.
[20:29.28]When some Muppets have the guy underneath with the real hands.
[20:32.08]We'll show Odile that he is out of his league.
[20:35.14]It's two puppeteers.
[20:36.34]We'll win easily.
[20:38.60]Long Poppin' is gonna say bye-bye to Johnson.
[20:43.88]No problem at all.
[20:46.34]I'll take Thomas.
[20:48.22]In a close one over, missed a three.
[20:50.74]Anything you say, Rick.
[20:52.58]Well, let's go down to the court as the first round is ready to begin.
[20:55.66]Okay.
[21:00.03]Bald Barker.
[21:00.93]Wait, this isn't on me.
[21:05.13]How do I play?
[21:07.42]We don't have to sit here and actually watch this, right?
[21:09.30]Jack O'Deal.
[21:10.22]Where's me?
[21:11.38]Is that me?
[21:48.69]I'm playing that fucking dumb game.
[21:54.98]Alright, let's go.
[22:17.25]I got pretty bad picks so far, I'm not gonna lie.
[22:22.33]The first two or three games, pretty bad picks.
[22:27.12]Let's see if I can pull this out here with, uh... This one might be alright.
[22:47.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:48.64]Why did I pick... No, I didn't.
[22:50.46]I didn't do, like, more of these, did I?
[22:54.50]It's another fucking politics game.
[22:56.86]It better not be.
[23:06.83]How was I... Look, the name of this game is Floor 13.
[23:11.97]Not anything to do with, like, politics.
[23:15.51]I thought this was gonna be like a scary game or like a point-and-click horror game or something.
[23:27.81]What?
[23:28.37]Okay.
[23:44.21]How do I go?
[23:49.74]Welcome.
[23:50.22]New DG.
[23:53.86]Decor style.
[23:55.13]Modern or traditional?
[23:57.65]Uh, modern.
[23:59.11]Please type the name... Please type your name in block capitals.
[24:06.81]I'm sorry.
[24:07.51]I mean, I do appreciate the fact that you're giving me the form, but I'm... It's kind of a sleazy way to give me your Mario Maker level.
[24:14.08]I don't do that.
[24:14.96]I don't do that.
[24:22.90]But thanks for the deed to the house.
[24:25.38]I appreciate it.
[24:28.18]That's not how I sign.
[24:28.98]Okay.
[24:36.72]Surveillance.
[24:38.46]Fourth removal.
[24:39.78]Two assassins.
[24:41.44]Pursuit.
[24:41.96]Four teams.
[24:45.30]Look, does anybody understand anything that's going on?
[24:47.62]Search.
[24:47.94]Three parties.
[24:48.54]Interrogate.
[24:49.12]Two cells.
[24:49.67]$100,000 in funds.
[24:59.05]Oh.
[25:02.01]Good morning, sir.

[37:42.25]And then after a day or so, he's going to put all the good stuff out.
[37:46.07]And then we're going to go in there and do it discreetly and find it.

[39:00.89]While he was at the grocery store.
[39:03.53]Or out to dinner.

[52:30.37]We're all going to be like winking at each other and like bumping a new driver like the coffee maker.
[52:37.43]A hundred fucking cover agents at this place that probably only has, what, like a hundred people in it?
[52:44.20]Let's go.
[52:50.35]It's 250.
[52:50.71]We're going to make up a significant portion.
[52:53.85]But, okay, if this is 250, what happens when 100 people get hired?
[52:57.66]We all have to get hired.
[52:58.88]We can't infiltrate that many.
[53:05.04]Does the National Union of Municipal Workers plan on expanding their workforce by like 35%?
[53:17.18]We're creating jobs.
[53:18.10]We're creating, like, fake inflated jobs.
[53:25.91]Okay, let's go.
[53:28.97]Infiltration in progress!
[53:34.12]Alright.
[53:37.10]Let's, uh, let's see the polls.
[53:40.34]Uh-oh.
[53:41.60]Uh-oh!
[53:42.66]Oh, we're... We're... We're four points behind!
[53:57.45]Oh, that was 50 more dollars that came in.
[53:59.29]A lot of money coming in today, guys.
[54:00.51]Seriously.
[54:01.67]Thank you for that.
[54:05.89]This is like another 50 fucking dollar drop.
[54:09.65]This is from J. Zanye West.
[54:14.47]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[54:18.99]Due to work, I'm away from family and friends a lot.
[54:21.65]My girlfriend and I watch your streams and content together.
[54:24.62]So watching while I'm on the road makes me feel a little closer to home.
[54:27.50]Thanks for the amazing content.
[54:29.86]PS, what are the odds of a scare Saturday's reboot?
[54:34.82]Well, first of all, thank you.
[54:39.47]I'm happy that you guys have something to connect.
[54:43.63]If it's here, if it's this community, if it's this stream, then that makes me fucking happy.
[54:55.24]Being away from people that you love is hard.
[54:59.46]But I'm really happy that you and your girlfriend have that.
[55:02.34]So, thank you.
[55:06.10]What are the odds of a Scare Saturday coming back?
[55:10.38]I would say probably zero chance.
[55:13.27]Because I would just play any new horror game that comes out regardless.
[55:16.77]I don't think it has to be on a set day.
[55:20.49]But I just want to be completely and totally just open about that.
[55:31.39]Scare every day.
[55:34.80]So you're saying that there is a chance.
[55:36.40]There is a chance.
[55:37.96]But I really do... Oh my god.
[55:40.40]I do appreciate the $50 on top of the other $50 that LaCranda just gave right now.
[55:50.14]Holy shit, guys.
[55:50.92]Alright.
[55:51.24]Thank you, LaCranda, for the 5,000 bits.
[55:53.01]It took me three weeks to save up this money.
[55:54.85]I won't have enough to pay the bills after this.
[55:56.93]But the streamer needs money.
[56:00.13]You better be paying your bills first.
[56:04.79]You better be paying your bills like five times over before you give me a cent.
[56:11.95]But thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars.
[56:15.23]Both of you.
[56:15.82]All of you.
[56:21.78]Alright, let's... Okay, let's see what happens tomorrow.
[56:29.51]We're infiltrating with our 100-person agent team.
[56:34.11]Uh-oh.
[56:45.05]This guy's got a lot of threats.
[56:49.44]Let me do this thing again.
[56:50.28]Remember this?
[56:53.19]Hey, you're becoming a serious liability.
[56:55.31]Questions are being asked in the house.
[56:57.61]Do you want to follow the last DG?
[57:00.29]Get serious or start flying!
[57:04.67]Fuck.
[57:14.43]Let's see what happened.
[57:21.42]What?
[57:23.22]To the shredder.
[57:25.53]For security reasons, all references to the following will be removed from our current records.
[57:31.05]Mr. James Ratcliffe.
[57:37.02]Okay.
[57:38.24]Because he's been dead for like five days.
[57:40.20]Alright.
[57:41.90]Infiltration report.
[57:44.10]All assigned agents penetrated.
[57:46.54]They were on a hiring boom.
[57:48.82]Number of agents successfully penetrated, 100.
[57:52.74]Initial penetration successful.
[57:55.04]Infiltration has risen to over 25% of core membership.
[58:02.41]Now, what the fuck do you want us to do?
[58:06.19]Because a couple of issues have arisen that I'm going to bring up very briefly.
[58:11.21]Because there's so many of us, we all try to do the same job.
[58:15.85]We all try to go to the bathroom at the same time to use our communicators in our ears.
[58:20.60]And it just looks kind of weird when 40 people go to the men's bathroom at the same time and 30 people go to the women's bathroom at the same time.
[58:29.54]And we need a better solution will be good.
[58:40.30]We're starting to arouse suspicion.
[58:53.21]What next?
[59:00.41]40 plus 30 equals 100.
[59:01.39]No.
[59:02.09]What about the people that have to stand watch outside the bathrooms?
[59:11.14]A hundred people all just get up from their chairs.
[59:17.16]Like bugs to a light.
[59:22.68]Group infiltrated.
[59:23.64]Okay.
[59:29.34]Dave Holtz has been here for four days.
[59:32.15]A member of a secret society.
[59:34.01]That's not a secret.
[59:36.30]Well, sooner or later, it's going to be our society.
[59:40.24]Because I'm going to send another hundred agents in there.
[59:46.03]Two-fifths of the company is infiltration.
[59:51.63]That's so stupid.
[59:59.12]I don't have one.
[59:59.76]I don't have a contact.
[60:00.64]Okay.
[60:03.79]Give orders.
[60:05.11]Now, there's nobody left to... Alright, now let's do a disinformation campaign on the inside.
[60:14.71]You know how easy that would be?
[60:16.31]Tell the fucking 40% of their workforce to stop trying.
[60:21.79]Just sit there and, like, spin a pencil around in your hand all day.
[60:24.66]They will lose so much productivity if you guys just, like, browse Reddit all day.
[60:29.66]We could completely control this.
[60:35.39]We don't even need to put out, like, a false report.
[60:41.57]Okay.
[60:43.29]Uh, let's leave reports.
[60:45.88]Let me go look at the suspects again.
[60:51.12]Next suspect.
[60:51.78]Alright, what did we get?
[60:53.42]Under interrogation.
[60:55.26]Orders.
[60:58.72]Um, I gotta remove... How do I get somebody out of interrogation?
[61:15.97]This is not gonna work, right?
[61:17.63]This is not gonna work.
[61:20.57]Imagine if you send in like a huge military team to where we are.
[61:25.76]Yeah, we're gonna- we're sending in like a big like raid on ourselves.
[61:42.87]No.
[61:45.63]The guy's just sitting there in a chair like, I'm waiting for the next guy to come in to interrogate me.
[61:51.62]And the door opens, the creaks open, like, what the hell's going on there?
[61:56.80]And a fucking flash can comes in.
[62:03.67]50 people, come on, get in!
[62:15.13]Alright, let's go to the department.
[62:18.25]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:23.41]Check captives.
[62:27.93]What does this mean?

[62:54.03]No, that's the cell.
[62:55.85]Okay, hold on.
[62:57.05]That's the cell.
[62:58.72]That's not... Right.
[63:02.44]Suspects.
[63:05.46]Right, okay.
[63:06.60]Okay, we've got... We're on... 2.
[63:10.83]Cell plan, dental plan, insurance, homeowner's insurance.

[64:12.62]Alright, that's fine.
[64:22.41]Let's go back to the door.

[65:07.25]Opposition MP Mr. Barry Matthews revealed a secret bill outlining government plans to sell off national parks.
[65:13.37]The leaked document concluded that many parks could easily be turned into golf courses and country clubs.
[65:20.56]What?

[66:02.84]No, I don't want to... What?
[66:10.95]What does that mean?
[66:16.25]Oh, they're both being like... What is... Oh my god.
[66:26.54]Ugh.

[66:40.43]Alright, I've got a... Group infiltrated.
[66:51.14]Group smeared.
[66:53.54]Ugh.
[66:57.40]They're just, like, fighting each other.
[67:01.52]They're just talking shit to each other.
[67:03.64]They're just making fun of each other.
[67:08.28]What a perfect smear campaign.
[67:21.69]Alright, let's see.
[67:23.93]Suspects.
[67:28.12]But how do I, what do I do?
[67:30.73]How do I do this?
[67:31.97]I need to like get him out of interrogation.
[67:34.39]He's been here for too long.
[67:48.04]Removal.
[67:48.76]But is this kill?
[67:49.82]Or is this just remove?
[67:53.48]There's a dispose and then there's a remove.
[67:59.57]Alright, I have to go back to the departments.
[68:06.72]Leave desk.
[68:12.86]Interrogation.
[68:13.58]I'm gonna say dispose.
[68:17.52]Remove is kill.
[68:18.66]Dispose is leave, right?
[68:49.04]No, no stop stop stop stop stop dispose Remove isn't it's worded weirdly remove is kill disposes get out right I
[69:10.83]Or else, how else would I let him out of interrogation?
[69:14.70]It's not the other way around.
[69:18.02]You can't remove somebody that's... New reports.
[69:24.60]Let's see.
[69:27.38]Dispose is what villains ask their henchmen to do.
[69:30.16]I know, but it's... Two people got fired.
[69:48.10]Boss, I was just doing the thing you told me to do.
[69:50.28]I sat around.
[69:51.80]I played Flash games.
[69:57.44]I went to the bathroom like 15 times.
[70:00.55]I took extended breaks.
[70:01.81]Why did we get fired?
[70:10.85]Is that it?
[70:11.21]That's it.
[70:19.29]So is he actually, alright, deceased.
[70:22.59]Next.
[70:31.08]So what the fuck does removal do?
[70:36.76]Yeah, I know, it's like the cartoon villain gives his monologue at the end and says, dispose of them.
[70:47.73]And then, like, the Batman throws the thing, and it, like, hits, like, three or four switches, and then he gets trapped.
[70:54.84]I know, but how do I get him out of the interrogation room?
[71:11.19]Hold on.
[71:11.83]What does this do?
[71:13.09]Oh, yeah!
[71:13.65]Removal, huh?
[71:15.17]Assassinate George Cox!
[71:18.30]Yeah, that's removal.
[71:19.40]What?
[71:20.28]Alright, we're gonna... Search his house.
[71:37.18]And then we're gonna tail him.
[71:39.96]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if the first person that we did, like, the military strike to was, like, the mole or whatever the whole time.
[71:48.11]And I can't end the game because I'm softlocked.
[72:00.72]Okay, let's give orders here.
[72:03.18]Surveillance.
[72:04.66]Yeah.
[72:06.34]And we're gonna discreetly search...
[72:09.23]You know what, just, no, no, no, no, no, discreet, discreet, discreet, discreet, discreet.
[72:15.46]Did I already do that?
[72:17.04]Discreet.
[72:20.12]Okay.
[72:23.21]What is even the point of, like, heavy assault?
[72:29.05]That doesn't seem to, why?
[72:42.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[72:44.69]Back it up.
[72:51.73]Couple of new reports.
[72:53.33]See if we got any info.
[72:56.62]PM, we'll see you tomorrow morning.
[73:00.30]Mounting political damage.
[73:04.05]Matthews has again embarrassed the government.
[73:06.21]Revelations that industrialists are receiving backhanders from the government in order to exaggerate output figures have been vehemently denied by the Department of Trade and Industry.
[73:18.41]Under surveillance being tailed, marked research.
[73:20.37]Okay.
[73:23.60]So the other ones being, we can just go to tomorrow.
[73:29.20]I do this every time.
[73:32.63]My sludge brain just goes back into the office every day.
[73:36.55]Again.
[73:43.43]Is he going to do it a third time?
[73:44.64]Is he going to do the Oz slide the thing?
[73:46.94]No, he's not.
[73:51.64]The Prime Minister says, I don't want to read derogatory remarks about this government in the press.
[73:58.04]Keep troublemakers quiet.
[74:00.04]I want this sorted out now.
[74:16.16]We must continue hold on document
[74:20.46]We must continue our plan to wreak havoc and chaos at every level of organized government.
[74:24.06]Switch the device on in the specified place in Morton-on-Stanley three days before the election.
[74:29.85]I have set down a false trail, so Philip, and thus, you will not be under suspicion.
[74:33.93]The Blue Nun.
[74:34.85]Uh-oh.
[74:42.45]Uh-oh.
[74:42.73]Alright, Matthews is... Two more people got fired.
[74:54.86]I'm not even sure this is how the polls look.
[74:58.47]Oh, we're going to lose.
[75:09.35]Next suspect.
[75:11.93]Okay, so this is the guy that's causing all the issues, right?
[75:18.92]What do we do?
[75:29.30]Disinformation.
[75:31.98]F-E-S-L.
[75:33.24]No, he said I can't... If I do that again, then I'm going to be in big trouble.
[75:48.35]I can't do it.
[75:49.25]I can't do a light.
[75:50.91]No, it's either... Remember he said don't do that again.
[75:53.69]You're getting too much info.
[75:57.36]Let's see what happens if we do some misinformation.
[76:13.80]Let's go.
[76:14.14]No.
[76:21.81]Just wait.
[76:22.33]We need to see if we can do this correct.
[76:28.42]New report.
[76:35.82]Wait a minute.
[76:39.47]Subject arrives at 150 Gao Gardens.
[76:42.50]Subject simply returns home, leaves home, goes to the pub, leaves the pub, returns home.
[76:49.86]Okay.
[76:52.51]Suspect or location file attached.
[76:57.09]Oh, there's a new... Executive of Megacorp.
[77:04.63]Friend?
[77:05.00]Oh, we found, this is him.
[77:23.40]Alright.
[77:27.24]Next report.
[77:33.42]So wait, we did a smear campaign and denied.
[77:36.94]Okay, next report.
[77:43.62]That worked.
[77:44.06]Alright, again, do surveillance.
[77:49.73]Sign the order.
[77:51.78]Alright, alright, alright.
[77:52.76]Hold on.
[77:53.60]We're getting there.
[77:55.32]Let's take a look at the polls.
[78:02.16]We gained a point.
[78:05.30]We have four days.
[78:05.98]Now I've removed the surveillance.
[78:14.62]It's alright.
[78:16.10]We got what we needed.
[78:21.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[78:22.58]The guy that I have is definitely the Blue Nun.
[78:28.16]Right?
[78:31.24]Nothing of interest in Barry Matthews' home.
[78:36.37]Two more agents have been fired.
[78:37.59]Well, okay, wait, hold on a minute.
[78:45.99]We are causing constant chaos and infiltrated with our entire workforce, all the agents, to try to get this guy Dave Holtz.
[78:57.30]Dave Holtz has been dead for like five days.
[79:00.72]So what are they doing here still?
[79:06.51]I think I need to pull them out and put them somewhere else.
[79:12.39]Okay, hold on.
[79:13.77]Let's leave one person.
[79:17.21]No agents.
[79:19.62]Wait, are they just stuck there?
[79:21.98]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[79:24.54]Can I pull them out?
[79:25.64]I think I can pull them out.
[79:30.32]Yeah, alright.
[79:30.96]I'm gonna pull them out.
[79:32.12]And then we're gonna go somewhere else.
[79:35.77]Suddenly 90 plus people quit.
[79:40.59]Thank you for the opportunity.
[79:41.73]I really appreciate it.
[79:42.63]Alright, let's go pull them out.

[80:34.54]Okay, wait.
[80:41.66]Give orders.
[80:43.85]No agents.
[80:45.87]Okay, let's wait.
[80:46.95]Maybe we have to wait for them to quit?
[80:49.97]See operations.
[80:55.66]Alright, let's see what happens.
[80:56.38]I just... I gotta get him over to the other place.
[81:13.06]Again, the same... I just had the palace on the phone.
[81:15.18]Don't... Get serious.

[82:14.52]No.
[82:15.24]Hey!
[82:15.60]Alright, so we have six people left.
[82:32.31]I can't believe this.
[82:33.01]Alright, well, we're gonna send... This is our sixth best.
[82:37.55]Send them all.
[82:39.43]Infiltrate.
[82:52.48]Okay, um... I guess we're gonna... What happened to our 96 agents?
[83:10.71]Hold on.
[83:11.07]For security reasons, all references to the following will be removed from our current records.
[83:15.84]Dave Holtz, Mr. Philip Owen, George Cox, and the National Union of Municipal Workers.
[83:21.44]So they all still are there, but now they just work there.
[83:27.43]They just are employees there now.
[83:36.67]Well, I guess you just work there.
[83:38.70]Okay.
[83:40.40]That's so fucking funny.
[83:42.96]Ooh, we have two gaining.
[83:45.34]Hold on here.
[83:49.73]Being tailed, being discredited.
[83:51.45]Okay.
[83:53.93]How's that smear campaign?
[84:02.82]Alright.
[84:03.48]Surveillance.
[84:04.08]Pursuit.
[84:05.18]Search.
[84:07.12]Uh... No, no, no, no.
[84:09.50]Um... We can't do anything crazy here.
[84:16.81]Let's just... No, no.
[84:18.83]Let's just stay.
[84:20.29]Tail them, I guess.
[84:23.77]What's going on next here?
[84:26.27]Suspect.
[84:26.73]Okay.
[84:27.92]Right.
[84:28.16]Alright.
[84:28.58]Okay.
[84:29.38]Alright.
[84:29.70]Let's go.
[84:31.58]We're gaining like a point a day.
[84:33.60]What if it's a 50-50?
[84:42.41]There's a Mr. Garcia waiting to see you.
[84:47.09]Who's that?
[85:05.32]I was, we were winning.
[85:07.00]We were winning.
[85:15.31]We were gaining a point a day.
[85:33.31]Alright.
[85:34.07]Well, we saw that one to the end.
[85:44.16]I have a few more streamer's choices, but I think we can do a chat choice now.
[85:52.24]Let's see.
[85:52.64]Let's make sure we're in the right spot.
[85:55.46]From where we were last time.
[85:57.44]Well, this is SimHealth.
[86:00.76]Uh, okay.
[86:04.90]Okay, I think, yeah, this is, I think, I remember doing this one, but I think that was a streamer's choice.
[86:12.74]Okay, are we good?
[86:14.50]I do, by the way, I already have that one.
[86:16.84]Let's move this down.
[86:18.58]Remember, it's the ones that you can actually see the text on.
[86:26.11]Alright.
[86:28.87]Here we go.
[86:31.05]Please click on your screen in just a second.
[86:40.81]Do it now?
[86:47.60]Family Feud, and what's the other one?
[86:49.40]Oh God.
[87:00.25]Captain Bible or Family Feud.
[87:13.87]Alright.
[87:16.31]Thank you for voting.
[87:18.35]I think we got it.
[87:22.60]We're gonna do Captain Bible.
[87:23.94]What the fuck even is Cap- What is Captain Bible?
[87:45.06]Oh man, okay.
[87:50.54]This is like hanging my computer.
[87:56.56]Why is it hanging my computer so hard?
[88:01.82]Come on, let's go!
[88:03.96]Stop this!
[88:04.60]Why is it- I'm hanging.
[88:06.32]My computer is just hanging.
[88:16.26]Fire has penetrated.
[88:22.02]Oh, dear.
[88:25.99]Well, has anybody seen any good books lately?
[88:29.49]Because I'm stuck right now.
[88:32.87]I got a wheel.
[88:33.43]Hold on.
[88:36.74]What is going on?
[88:47.26]Fucking... Cap... Bible, whatever the hell it is.
[88:59.30]What is going on?
[89:00.20]You're killing me.
[89:08.29]I may need to, uh... Do some control... Oh, there we go!
[89:12.47]Okay.
[89:13.15]We're good.
[89:16.82]Captain Bible.
[89:19.09]Thank God.
[89:28.01]Here we go.
[89:29.67]What was that?
[89:35.78]There was... There was once a...
[89:40.44]Captain Bible!
[89:40.80]Why is Captain Bible?
[90:06.28]Assaulting Hogwarts in the Star Fox Landmaster.
[90:15.41]What the fuck is going on?
[90:20.99]Oh, I came as quickly as I could.
[90:23.91]Is that Captain Bible or am I Captain Bible?
[90:27.49]Thank you for coming, Captain Bible.
[90:28.83]I've asked you to come here because this city has been taken by the enemy and we haven't been able to break its hold on it.
[90:34.79]He planted a tower of deception inside, generating a dome of darkness.
[90:38.92]That dome is actually an anti-truth field.
[90:41.18]It makes people very prone to being deceived.
[90:47.20]Why don't we just storm the city and take it by force?
[90:49.98]Because we've only been able to open a small hole in the dome, and that hole is very unstable.
[90:55.56]So how do I fit into this?
[90:57.58]It's funny that you use that phrase, because we are sending you through that hole into the city.
[91:04.91]So what do I do when I get inside?
[91:06.29]Can I expect any resistance?
[91:07.47]What about the people?
[91:09.88]Should I expect any problems with my computer bible?
[91:17.96]Your computer bible might be damaged going through the field, so we've been sending in scripture stations where you can get verses for it.
[91:24.93]Why is he so sad?
[91:27.47]Yes, I saw them outside.
[91:28.69]How will I know where to find them?
[91:31.07]You should already have the maps that we sent you.
[91:33.62]They show where the station should be.
[91:35.66]Okay, uh... What do I do when I get inside?
[91:42.51]Your mission will be to knock out the Tower of Deception, which is generating the dome.
[91:49.08]How do I do that?
[91:50.58]You'll need to use the city's Unibot.
[91:53.66]We'll put you as close as we can to it, but you'll need to get help from seven other people in order to operate it.
[91:59.71]The Seven Deadly Sins!
[92:04.33]The seven deadly virtues, whatever the fuck they're called.
[92:06.91]Alright, let's go.
[92:08.07]This music's going to make me crazy.
[92:10.53]Now, before you go, I think we should pray.
[92:12.83]Probably from... Lord, please help Captain Bible on this mission.
[92:17.54]Please keep him safe and let your truth overcome the darkness of deception.
[92:21.84]Amen.
[92:23.64]Amen.
[92:29.35]Alright, this is so alive.
[92:34.35]Hold on, let me- Wait, wait, did you see- Okay, wait, wait, wait, normal, easy, or di- Alright, hold on.
[92:44.60]I have to exit.
[92:49.85]This shit is fucking gonna kill my ears.
[92:52.11]Alright, that's alright, that's better.
[92:57.83]I'm not going to do difficult.
[93:03.36]I should do easy, if anything.
[93:14.55]I can give you trivia answers.
[93:16.23]Is it?
[93:17.91]No, I'm doing normal.
[93:18.69]I'm not doing difficult in Captain Bible.
[93:24.61]So, am I in the dome of deception?
[93:27.27]Faith.
[93:28.27]Your faith is at a hundred percent.
[93:33.45]Okay, is this like a roguelike?
[93:38.53]What is this?
[93:39.91]No verse is loaded.
[93:40.99]Oh, this is my Bible computer.
[93:47.76]Get a verse.
[93:50.62]Verse loaded.
[93:51.18]Genesis 127.
[93:52.12]So God created man in his own image.
[93:54.62]In the image of God, he created him.
[93:56.62]Male and female.
[93:57.40]He created the... I don't know the rest.
[93:59.10]I have no idea.
[93:59.60]I've got to go to the Bible machine, ATM, to find out what happens next.
[94:05.18]Oh.
[94:06.34]The trouble he causes recoils on himself.
[94:08.82]His violence comes down on his own head.
[94:17.93]What the fuck?
[94:22.55]It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.
[94:28.07]So God created man in his own image.
[94:30.23]In the image of God, he created him.
[94:31.61]Man and female, and then created them.
[94:56.48]I thought I instantly died.
[94:59.16]So wait, I have to use Bible verses to stop the robot murderers.
[95:03.78]Alright, let me go look at my map.
[95:06.44]Holy shit, are you serious?
[95:08.38]Look at this.
[95:11.91]This is too big, this is too much.
[95:19.93]Wait, hold on, there's another verse.
[95:23.31]The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[95:27.47]It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
[95:33.35]Ahem.
[95:44.76]The tongue is also fire, a word of evil among the parts of the body.
[95:48.96]It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire.
[95:52.80]And it is itself set on fire by hell.
[96:05.65]Is that it?
[96:09.32]Hmm, must be a destroyed cyborg.
[96:14.86]The power of Christ compels you!
[96:17.91]What about this one?
[96:20.75]That looks like it's gonna dig into my body when I walk forward.
[96:32.22]Cyber lie incoming!
[96:36.52]Children are born pure and innocent.
[96:39.08]If you let them do whatever they want they will grow up with great wisdom.
[96:44.38]What?
[96:48.67]What do you mean?
[96:53.01]How is that?
[96:53.31]What?
[96:53.49]How do I do true or false?
[97:02.80]So God created Matt.
[97:04.08]No, this is not right.
[97:05.72]Off.
[97:12.21]It's a cyber lie.
[97:16.61]I don't have that yet.
[97:19.34]Ow.
[97:23.96]Confront the... Okay.
[97:25.97]Here comes another cyber lie.
[97:29.91]Here we go.
[97:31.37]You are a fluke of nature.
[97:33.49]Just a random, meaningless event.
[97:41.78]Where is it?
[97:42.12]Right here.
[97:42.84]So God created man in his own image.
[97:44.40]In the image of God, he created him.
[97:45.90]Male and female, he created them.
[97:50.00]No!
[97:52.60]What?
[97:58.74]Defend!
[98:02.42]Got it!
[98:13.05]Bible power!
[98:15.01]Uh-oh.
[98:19.20]Again, you're a fluke of nature.
[98:21.13]No, I am of God.
[98:26.67]What is that laser?
[98:34.08]Incoming cyber lie detected.
[98:38.08]It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.
[98:45.65]The trouble, he causes recoils on himself.
[98:47.41]His violence comes down on his own head.
[98:51.50]The tongue is also fire.
[98:58.84]Here we go.
[99:03.31]I'm at 49%.
[99:06.99]What happens when I run out of faith power?
[99:21.35]Hold on.
[99:21.57]I need to see a map.
[99:24.85]Trap.
[99:25.85]Trap.
[99:26.41]Prayer Chapel.
[99:27.07]I'm just going to go down, I guess.
[99:33.62]I need more verses, don't I?
[99:37.76]Here we go.
[99:42.12]No, wait.
[99:42.46]It's this one.
[99:45.80]Right?
[99:46.43]Which one was it?
[99:53.50]Oh no, I didn't- I couldn't do this one yet.
[99:55.21]I had to turn- I had to run away.
[100:01.69]Alright, what about in here?
[100:06.39]Did I- I went in here already?
[100:07.51]Where do I need to go?
[100:08.69]So I can't go down.
[100:11.23]Go up and to the right?
[100:12.34]Or to the left and then down?
[100:13.82]Let's try over here.
[100:17.62]Here we go.
[100:19.16]New verse.
[100:21.50]That he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the twelve after that.
[100:28.21]He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
[100:36.87]I need a match to unlock.
[100:40.12]It is most important to totally love God and to truly love people also.
[100:43.64]Uh...
[100:51.09]The tongue is also fire.
[100:54.93]I don't think it's any of these.
[100:55.67]I have to go down from here.
[101:08.54]Yeah.
[101:12.42]Oh, we got another one.
[101:13.10]Sounds good.
[101:23.87]Lord, please.
[101:30.29]Alright, this is like using the world card in Vining of Isaac.
[101:36.45]Restore my faith.
[101:37.85]Give me the sword of the spirit.
[101:39.22]Give me the shield of faith.
[101:40.58]Warn me of traps and snares.
[101:42.58]Light my path before me.
[101:50.10]Light my path before me.
[101:54.84]How much faith do I have?
[101:56.53]Not enough.
[101:59.71]Thank you, Lord.
[102:00.73]I believe.
[102:02.69]Lord, please give me the sword of the... Light my path before me.
[102:08.35]Where in the Bible does it talk about God lighting my path?
[102:17.64]I don't know.
[102:23.01]Lord, please give me that cool sword.
[102:26.57]What does it talk about?
[102:27.17]The sword of the spirit.
[102:31.79]Hey, Lord.
[102:33.38]I could use some more things.
[102:38.22]Lord, please.
[102:41.84]Where in the Bible does it talk about avoiding traps?
[102:45.52]Right here.
[102:47.40]Right?
[102:48.94]Avoid like the... Here we go.
[102:53.12]Did it work?
[103:01.69]I'm not very good at this.
[103:05.71]Okay, I got full health.
[103:06.97]What's in here?
[103:10.53]Here we go.
[103:11.51]An easy one.
[103:12.72]Got you.
[103:28.11]Alright, so now what have I got?
[103:34.69]I might be able to go up now.
[103:41.44]What was this one?
[103:47.86]The rainbow is just light refracting through water, not a creation of God with a divine purpose.
[103:52.37]Uh-oh.
[103:55.61]Is that the, uh...
[103:59.58]That's a cyber lie.
[104:06.74]Are we sure this is not just like a scientist with a helmet on?
[104:18.35]This Genesis?

[105:43.95]Dude, there are people dressed like this in Stormwind, okay?
[105:47.53]They're like the hammer.
[105:48.41]I can just walk by him?
[106:01.88]For this is what the high and lofty one says, he who lives forever, whose name is holy.
[106:07.82]I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the... Okay.

[107:09.20]Do one to others before they do one to you, and you'll get away with it.
[107:22.29]That's a pretty sick shield.
[107:24.06]Look at that.
[107:24.36]Look at the back.
[107:26.14]That's a nice shield.
[107:33.56]Get out.

[108:02.97]Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[108:07.42]Right, alright, unlock.
[108:09.74]Match to unlock.
[108:12.46]It takes discipline to get the foolishness out of a kid.
[108:19.33]What?

[109:18.01]No.
[109:22.10]Another cyber lie.
[109:26.50]If a gang tells you to do it, then you just gotta do it.
[109:36.49]What is even the context here?
[109:43.51]Proverbs?
[109:48.64]No, this thing's gonna kill me.
[109:54.36]Thank God.
[109:56.30]I mean, like, honestly, thank God, right?
[109:57.66]I say that a lot, but for real.
[109:58.77]Uh-oh.

[111:32.29]The sword of the spirit.
[111:33.88]Here it is.
[111:38.08]That was a very holy Legend of Zelda melody thing.
[111:43.82]Whatever, forget it.
[111:50.09]It's not important.
[111:57.70]Alright, I'm gonna go up.
[111:59.20]So I can unlock this door now.

[112:06.65]Oh, you hit harder in battle.
[112:09.59]Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright.
[112:11.51]Foolishness!
[112:12.57]Oh, child, you be foolish!
[112:17.54]Wait, what the fuck is it?
[112:25.60]Proverbs.
[112:26.28]Alright, open the damn door.
[112:32.59]What?
[112:34.51]What is going on?
[112:39.61]Okay, whose picture is that?
[112:42.85]The new Lamb of God.
[112:46.72]What?
[112:48.68]He's Jesus incarnated.
[112:53.20]What the fuck is going on?
[112:57.96]He is not!
[113:02.06]Uh... He is not.
[113:04.73]He is too!
[113:05.85]He is not!

[113:23.96]Uh, no.
[113:25.12]Hold on.
[113:29.12]I'm back.
[113:31.81]Would you like to talk to me?
[113:33.63]No, you must be from Babylon.
[113:34.81]You are not a true believer.
[113:37.25]Whose picture is that?
[113:38.93]What?
[113:42.85]The Bible shows that there is no reincarnation.
[113:48.63]Oh, that's how we do the... That's how we... I don't get it.
[113:54.71]I don't get it.
[113:56.45]Go away.
[113:57.99]Okay, but I'll be back.
[114:02.50]I don't get it.
[114:06.10]Ay-yi-yi.
[114:08.92]Alright, so we're gonna go... Down?
[114:11.55]Down?
[114:16.09]Do I have this one?
[114:18.27]Shit.
[114:19.71]Okay.
[114:19.97]Let's try this one.
[114:21.13]No, no, no, no, no!
[114:22.13]Stop, stop, stop!
[114:22.64]What the fuck?
[114:31.68]Some Christians have changed their minds and become atheists.
[114:34.05]That proves that the Bible is full of lies.
[114:39.25]The tongue is also fire.
[114:46.53]The sword of the spirit.
[114:54.60]What?
[114:59.96]I don't think I have this one.
[115:04.57]Can I go up to the right?
[115:08.07]Alright, go through and just... I might have... Stop!
[115:11.25]Why does that have to happen?
[115:12.76]There we go.
[115:17.44]Okay, they will... Children are born pure and innocent.
[115:20.47]Wait, do we have that one?
[115:27.95]Is it Proverbs?
[115:32.21]I feel like it is.
[115:34.04]Alright.
[115:35.90]What the fuck?
[115:42.65]Why did I just use that?
[115:44.16]Why even use the sword?
[115:45.08]I have a legit gamma death ray.
[115:49.46]Why would I use the sword?
[116:00.42]If you don't love Jesus, you don't love God.
[116:02.39]I don't think I have this.
[116:16.64]In addition to all this, take up the shield of the faith.
[116:20.06]With which you can extinguish all of the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[116:24.44]Ooh, I can block flaming arrows now.
[116:31.68]The rainbow is just light refracting through water.
[116:34.38]Not a creation of God with a divine purpose.
[116:42.76]I don't think I have this.
[116:47.17]I don't think I have, like, a God created the world, right?
[116:49.45]I don't have this yet.
[116:54.09]Is it Genesis?
[116:55.27]No, this is created man in his image.
[116:59.84]This is not about anything else.
[117:07.84]Alright, we gotta go back up then.
[117:16.44]Okay, we got another one.
[117:20.47]Here we go.
[117:21.07]Whenever I bring clouds over the Earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you, and all living creatures are very kind.
[117:28.98]Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
[117:31.66]Here we go.
[117:34.00]Do not go up there.
[117:48.80]Here we go.
[117:51.51]Holy shit, he almost just killed me.
[118:03.03]Oh, that's not good.
[118:05.43]Please tell me there's something in here that I can use.
[118:06.93]Yes.
[118:21.74]Alright, Lord, please give me the Shield of Faith.
[118:27.88]Here it is.
[118:29.40]To block the Flaming Arrows.
[118:30.58]Thank you, Lord.
[118:35.48]Warn me of anything else?
[118:44.11]I'm, like, doing pretty well in this game.
[118:47.37]Alright, there was another one about the rainbow stuff up here, right?
[118:58.99]Up and, uh, up and to the right and then up.
[119:10.59]Do I have this one?
[119:14.19]No.
[119:14.97]Wait, hold on.
[119:21.62]Hold on, here we go.
[119:22.96]I got it.
[119:25.62]What if some don't have faith?
[119:27.59]Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?
[119:31.27]Not at all!
[119:34.27]Got it.
[119:37.82]What did I just get?
[119:52.00]Okay, I just got like a power-up or something.
[120:01.47]What's in here?
[120:04.25]Destroyed a robot.
[120:06.69]What about this one?
[120:15.62]This one didn't work last time.
[120:21.42]No, this one doesn't work.
[120:22.18]I have to just walk through.
[120:34.37]So we need to go up to the right.
[120:35.43]Let's see if I can unlock.
[120:41.73]Okay, it is most important to totally love God and to truly love people also.
[120:49.20]No.
[120:54.68]No.
[120:55.46]No.
[120:57.58]No.
[120:59.28]No.
[121:04.87]No, I don't have this.
[121:06.27]Shit.
[121:09.98]Was there anything else up here?
[121:12.08]Like, straight up, maybe.
[121:13.22]Yeah, okay, wait a minute.
[121:16.62]This is the science one, right?
[121:18.04]Yep, I remember this one.
[121:21.85]The rainbow is just light.
[121:22.99]Yep.
[121:24.47]We can go through here.
[121:27.27]Got it.
[121:38.39]So is that giving me, like, faith up, or is that just replenishing my faith?
[121:44.12]I'm not really sure.
[121:44.76]That's probably, like, a refill.
[121:50.90]Apparently.
[121:54.10]This is a... Okay, this is a big one.
[122:02.78]Shit.
[122:04.29]There's two of these that I don't think I have the right, um, verse for.
[122:10.44]This one didn't work.
[122:16.88]It does work.
[122:17.50]I thought I did it before and it didn't work.
[122:18.88]Alright, this is gonna be hard, I think.
[122:20.38]Uh-oh!
[122:30.28]Uh-oh!
[122:41.95]How do I kill him?
[122:47.69]How do I back out?
[122:48.79]How do I back out?
[122:50.03]How do I get out?
[122:51.07]How do I get out?
[122:59.08]Did I do it?
[123:06.02]Your faith is at 0.4%.
[123:12.59]0.4 percent I need to heal right now it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the wealth of god please don't be a monster fuck no one cares
[123:41.98]Cast all your anxiety away because he cares for you.
[123:45.60]I have to instantly kill him too.
[123:46.92]Thank god.
[123:49.00]Alright, I need health.
[123:59.76]Save the game and heal.
[124:04.37]Save game.
[124:08.73]Right here.
[124:09.85]Enter name.
[124:14.63]Got it.
[124:14.85]Okay.
[124:16.15]Uh-oh.
[124:28.96]If someone says that they're Christian and have a ministry, then you can trust them.
[124:34.90]Uh, the tongue is also fire.
[124:37.96]Wait, hold on.
[124:49.87]uh wait if sinners entice you do not give in to them I don't know which one it is will a lack of uh no I'm gonna try the romans
[125:21.74]I'm gonna go for it.
[125:22.86]It's either Romans or... No, no, run away?
[125:28.72]I don't, yeah, I don't have it.
[125:39.51]Well, maybe this is it.
[125:42.05]I am the vine, you are the branches.
[125:44.22]If a man remains in me, and I in him, he will bear much fruit.
[125:47.52]Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[125:50.64]Okay.
[125:51.88]I don't think that helps us.
[125:54.52]I could probably... Maybe I should go down.
[126:00.56]Um... I can't... I don't think I can get over there.
[126:05.99]Maybe down here?
[126:06.65]Let me try to heal first.
[126:14.07]Maybe... I don't think I can.
[126:16.15]I'm assuming you can only use one prayer room once.
[126:23.57]Lord, please.
[126:25.41]Oh, shit.
[126:25.93]No, we're good.
[126:27.78]We're good.
[126:35.38]Alright.
[126:37.00]So, there's this person down here that we have to convince you can't come back to life.
[126:41.38]I don't think I have that.
[126:51.91]Do I have that?
[126:59.71]Oh, there's a door over here.
[127:00.73]Alright, let's go see if I can do anything.
[127:05.03]So I have to go up, right, down.
[127:19.28]No, down, down, down, down, down.
[127:20.12]Alright, what about down here?
[127:22.16]No, I've already done these.
[127:23.34]What about the one across from the V?
[127:25.52]Wait.
[127:32.50]Here we go.
[127:32.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[127:38.47]These things are hard.
[127:39.13]No, they're not.
[127:39.93]These are easy ones.
[127:51.40]Alright.
[127:52.70]We gotta go left, and then up, and then right.
[128:02.15]Um... I don't know if we have this.
[128:10.54]I am the vine.
[128:21.70]Hold on.
[128:24.99]No.
[128:29.11]Is it this one?
[128:32.03]Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
[128:38.42]I don't think that's that clear, though.
[128:47.82]Let's try this one.
[128:50.35]Nope.
[128:51.99]Nope.
[128:56.03]You don't lose anything for this, though.
[128:58.03]Just try John.
[129:01.65]Am I losing faith?
[129:02.55]No.
[129:05.35]I'm just guessing at the door.
[129:07.33]Guessing the password.
[129:11.39]I don't have this.
[129:11.93]Alright, do I have the thing that's necessary to... Okay.
[129:22.60]What?
[129:23.44]That's reincarnated.
[129:24.38]There's no such thing as reincarnation, and I'll prove it!
[129:33.74]Uh He was buried that he was raised on the third day no, this is proving reincarnation This is me proving That you can reincarnate So I'm about to get like this thrown back in my face I don't get it go away
[130:04.75]That's not it.
[130:10.75]Jesus resurrected, not reincarnated.
[130:15.21]Right.
[130:16.15]Right.
[130:16.97]That's true.
[130:17.47]Okay, you're right.
[130:18.29]You got me there.
[130:22.63]Uh, what have I not tried?
[130:24.17]Down to the right?
[130:32.33]It looks like a whole hallway here that I didn't do.
[130:37.23]up I think there's a monster in here no okay this is the prayer area I remember that one alright did I get this one no one cares uh yes they do he does
[131:08.61]It's a really strange version of Samus.
[131:13.23]Here we go.
[131:16.54]He who hates me hates my father as well.
[131:19.18]Okay.
[131:28.02]Alright, we're loading up on verses here.
[131:29.92]Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?
[131:31.90]Declares the Sovereign Lord.
[131:33.64]Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
[131:47.10]Uh, alright, so what is that going to open?
[132:02.65]If you don't love Jesus, you don't love God, right?
[132:05.41]No, no, I think we have this one.
[132:13.64]Yeah, if you, like, hate me, then you hate, yeah, where is it?
[132:18.78]Who hates me hates my father as well.
[132:21.80]Got it.
[132:28.05]Um, what's happening here?
[132:30.25]Why am I playing like the 3D Sonic globe game?
[132:41.29]Oh shit.
[132:49.84]God wants to kill the sinners before they get a chance to repent.
[132:52.51]No, no, no, no.
[132:53.33]Where is it?
[132:55.93]We just got it.
[133:03.35]We just got it.
[133:09.87]What the hell is it called?
[133:10.65]The one where it's like, I don't want to... I want you to turn away from Ezekiel.
[133:16.34]Here it is.
[133:17.38]There we go.
[133:17.68]Here we go.
[133:33.06]persevere alright Jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as yourself alright keep me from the snares they have laid for me from the trap set by the evildoers okay now I can see all traps and snares so what is in this story I feel like a boss door save it
[134:09.69]Alright.
[134:11.47]Uh, one may have, uh, traps and snares.
[134:16.22]What was it called?
[134:16.76]I don't... I just got it and I don't even remember what the hell it was.
[134:30.18]There we go.
[134:32.73]So now... What does that mean?
[134:35.97]Do I have light my path?
[134:37.19]Might as well just restore faith.
[134:44.75]Okay.
[134:46.51]I don't think I have Light My Path before me yet.
[134:51.35]No, I don't have it.
[134:57.73]So that's it.
[134:58.81]There's one more area.
[135:01.77]I still don't have a thing about reincarnation.
[135:08.25]Do I have to run back?
[135:09.41]Of course I do.
[135:18.72]Not bad.
[135:19.66]This is not considered a trap.
[135:23.94]Alright, up.
[135:26.03]Left and up.
[135:27.21]Let's see if we can get in there.
[135:42.16]Seek God and he will answer you.
[135:45.76]Um...
[135:52.19]I don't know if we have this.
[136:02.78]No.
[136:06.36]Love the Lord.
[136:07.16]Apart from me.
[136:11.32]No, none of this is about he who hates me.
[136:15.20]Hates, no.
[136:15.52]No.
[136:17.66]No, we can't get in here.
[136:23.50]So the only place I can go is up here.
[136:30.08]There has to be something I can do up there because I can't do anything else over here.
[136:34.80]Why is it blinking?
[136:35.72]Oh.
[136:39.12]All the way up.
[136:39.88]Go, go, go, go.
[136:40.76]Those are trap doors.
[136:44.54]Oh, okay.
[136:45.00]It just blinks if it's a trap door.
[136:48.80]Alright.
[136:49.20]Let me get in here.
[136:54.24]I got this.
[136:54.54]It is most important to totally love God and to truly love people, right?
[136:57.64]I have this.
[137:05.68]Wait, what?
[137:10.86]There it is, right?
[137:13.63]That's it?
[137:17.43]Get in!
[137:20.33]Oh, God.
[137:21.49]This, like, hurts my head.
[137:26.72]I really don't want it.
[137:27.37]This is another one of those, like, jump warps.
[137:36.29]It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
[137:38.80]Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
[137:44.74]I'm almost at the end of the game, guys.
[137:46.54]It's almost done.
[137:56.81]The greatest Christian commandment is that you go to church.
[138:00.69]No.
[138:01.95]It is not.
[138:02.93]It is the... What is it?
[138:14.17]Where is it?
[138:15.05]That's like the greatest commandment.
[138:16.91]What was it?
[138:25.56]Yes, it is.
[138:33.43]Don't even let him do anything.
[138:34.25]Don't even let him attack.
[138:41.26]Uh, alright.
[138:42.62]But even if we are an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preach to you, let him be eternally condemned.
[138:50.58]What does that do for me, though?
[138:52.04]Oh, shit.
[138:52.58]This is a spider.
[138:56.25]What did you come from?
[139:01.76]Jesus told one truth.
[139:02.84]Other teachers have told other truths.
[139:04.94]You should believe them just as much as Jesus.
[139:06.72]We just got it.
[139:09.04]There it is.
[139:09.39]Alright, we have never fought the spider before, though.
[139:13.03]I don't know what to do here.
[139:21.70]Did he give up?
[139:25.38]What?
[139:25.60]Uh.
[139:38.45]I cut all of his legs off.
[139:42.11]You couldn't have just liquefied him or something?
[139:45.07]Alright, well that's trapped her there.
[139:54.66]You don't need the Bible as long as you have something to eat.
[139:58.14]No, there's one specifically about bread in here.
[140:02.81]Where is it?
[140:04.19]You can live off of bread alone, right?
[140:06.97]There it is.
[140:17.32]I can't believe I'm going to beat this game.
[140:20.30]I don't know why, but for some reason this is unbelievable to me.
[140:25.71]Oh, shit.
[140:26.19]We've got to save it right here.
[140:27.19]This is the hard one.
[140:34.02]I have to do this.
[140:35.34]Here we go.
[140:39.32]Holy God would never associate with an insignificant speck of protoplasm like you.
[140:44.43]No, it's like the... We're... God is us and we are God, right?
[140:52.47]Which one is it?
[140:57.64]Um... No, no, no, no, no.
[140:58.72]It's, um... Which one is this?
[141:04.58]Is it... Um...
[141:08.46]Here it is.
[141:09.54]I am the vine, you are the branches.
[141:10.76]If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit.
[141:12.89]Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[141:13.99]There we go.
[141:15.17]Right?
[141:16.69]John 15, 5?
[141:18.03]That's not it?
[141:30.42]He who lives forever, whose name is holy.
[141:31.88]I live in a high and holy place, but also with him is... Oh, yeah, it's this one.
[141:37.27]Alright, this guy hits hard, so... Why was that guy so much easier than the last one?
[141:52.51]Like, I mean, we're talking ten times easier than the last one.
[142:01.91]All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
[142:09.19]Okay.
[142:10.21]So, you're judged by the law.
[142:11.61]Don't, like, break the law.
[142:14.32]Law.
[142:15.12]Alright.
[142:15.84]Let's go again.
[142:16.62]Nope.
[142:19.82]Law.
[142:21.76]When Jesus died, he stayed dead.
[142:23.08]After all, nobody saw him after the... Okay, this is the one where he... It's Genesis, right?
[142:28.17]I don't know.
[142:28.51]Which, uh...
[142:31.63]Which one is it?
[142:32.17]Right here.
[142:33.80]Which one is it?
[142:34.30]Right, right, right.
[142:34.84]Where is it?
[142:35.20]Where is it?
[142:35.56]Where is it?
[142:35.96]Where is it?
[142:36.32]Where is it?
[142:36.76]Where is it?
[142:37.06]Where is it?
[142:38.94]Which one is it?
[142:39.40]Where is it?
[142:39.84]Where is it?
[142:40.22]Where is it?
[142:40.46]Which one is it?
[142:40.92]Where is it?
[142:41.68]Where is it?
[142:47.91]There it is.
[142:50.07]And... Oh, he has to open his eye.
[143:00.17]Okay, that's how.
[143:01.83]How did I shoot him that many times and not hit his eye?
[143:04.51]I don't know how.
[143:06.83]Alright, that's a trap over there.
[143:09.07]This is probably like a holy room?
[143:12.57]Yes.
[143:13.71]Alright, I am not going to use this heal because I'm probably going to need it.
[143:19.19]Do I have the light yet?
[143:23.68]This is a big circle.
[143:31.11]I think I almost have all of them.
[143:34.68]People can't be expected to live by God's laws.
[143:37.04]Law, law, law, law, law.
[143:38.24]We just got it.
[143:40.62]Which one is it?
[143:41.10]Galactus?
[143:44.74]No.
[143:50.41]There it is.
[143:59.99]I'm getting pretty good at this.
[144:03.40]Just as a man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment.
[144:06.70]Die once.
[144:09.02]No reincarnation we can bring it back.
[144:14.14]I have almost explored everything.
[144:23.14]You don't have to accept Jesus in order to love God.
[144:28.82]um I don't know you don't have to accept yeah where's the one that like you you have to be the brand the branch right he who hates me hates my father alright
[144:59.49]This is every... I think I got them all.
[145:03.92]Jonathan grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord is God.
[145:08.40]Before the... Jonathan grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord is God.
[145:17.21]Lord.
[145:17.91]Light the path, Lord.
[145:18.77]Uh-oh.
[145:22.37]Random spider.
[145:24.71]Real power is obtained through intimidation and manipulation.
[145:29.16]Law.
[145:38.94]I don't know which one that is.
[145:46.08]Ezekiel?
[145:47.08]No.
[146:04.81]Is it this one?
[146:06.51]It is that one.
[146:14.98]That's funny.
[146:15.66]It's just funny.
[146:16.86]Alright, now let's go light our path.
[146:20.44]Go prove that reincarnation doesn't exist.
[146:30.34]That's not it?
[146:32.94]That's not it?
[146:41.40]Which one is it?
[146:41.86]I think I have them all.
[146:49.87]Lighting a path.
[146:52.23]I think I have every single one.
[147:00.72]Well, I'm just going to heal.
[147:08.54]Alright, let's go... Oh, there's two up here.
[147:14.77]Alright, let's go back.
[147:21.71]This is the... No, that's not a... Where's the jump door?
[147:25.22]Here it is.
[147:43.32]Alright.
[147:44.94]We go prove reincarnation.
[147:47.34]See if we can open the door opposite.
[147:49.82]So I need to go down, left, up.
[147:59.18]I'm wholly invested in this.
[148:02.68]I mean, A-W-H.
[148:05.67]Oh.
[148:06.43]Like, wholly.
[148:11.67]Alright.
[148:13.19]Hey, I'm back!
[148:16.35]Oh, whose picture is that?
[148:19.63]Okay, there is no such thing as reincarnation, and I'm back, and I got the Bible to prove it.
[148:28.44]And, uh, let me scroll through here.
[148:33.02]Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.
[148:38.11]If people can only die once, then that means that they can't come back as babies and die over again.
[148:44.49]Well, maybe, but he's still the new Lamb of God.
[148:47.87]He is the Holy One who has the new holy revelation that was never mentioned in the Bible that proves that he's true.
[148:54.37]Well, the Bible talks about people who preach a different gospel.
[148:59.09]It's the angel one.
[149:03.16]Where is it?
[149:06.42]But even if... Okay.
[149:09.50]How can he be holy when the Bible calls him accursed?
[149:14.19]Did the eyes just move?
[149:16.97]Were the eyes looking at her last time?
[149:21.41]He's always been so good to me and guided me into the new truth and accepted me into his family.
[149:26.37]Just because he seems nice, that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive.
[149:30.67]Listen to this verse.
[149:38.68]Listen to this one.
[149:42.82]Just because he seems nice, that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive.
[149:47.02]Where is it?
[149:50.22]Where is it?
[149:50.98]It's like one of the first ones.
[149:55.95]The tongue is fire.
[149:57.29]Yeah, where is it?
[150:04.07]Where is it?
[150:04.67]Hold on.
[150:10.74]I don't know if it's this one.
[150:21.85]The Romans?
[150:23.35]No.
[150:27.64]He seems nice.
[150:29.06]I live in a... No.
[150:46.48]Oh, my son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.
[150:51.99]Right?
[150:59.37]This might be it.
[151:03.10]Maybe.
[151:04.22]Let's try it.
[151:06.62]I don't get it.
[151:07.12]Oh, goddammit.
[151:13.13]no reincarnation okay where is it I gotta start like I can't even like burn these into my brain I don't even remember which one it is I really don't I like I don't it's all I I'm just I don't even know no I don't want to burn these I'm not like that religious or anything like I don't want to
[151:47.19]Okay.
[151:48.63]Uh... And then this is... It's the... This one.
[151:54.11]Okay.
[151:55.39]Now we have... He's nice to me.
[151:58.56]But that doesn't... Just because he seems nice doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive.
[152:04.90]I don't even... We might not even have this one.
[152:15.51]Keep me from the snares?
[152:18.76]Maybe the... Yeah, I'll try the one... This is the only one that makes any sense.
[152:27.10]No.
[152:27.40]I don't know if we have it.
[152:38.74]I'll come back.
[152:40.62]I'll be back again to try to convince you.
[152:45.36]Seek God and he will answer you.
[152:47.50]I don't know if I have this one either.
[153:05.23]Leo.
[153:08.26]Seek God and he will answer you.
[153:17.81]I am the vine?
[153:18.69]Did I do this one before already?
[153:24.51]I don't love... It's not Austin 316.
[153:42.12]Folly, my son, keep me from the snares, the troubling... This one?
[153:51.38]Does anybody have any idea?
[153:53.92]Just give it to me.
[154:07.01]I don't have it.
[154:09.78]I have to beat this game.
[154:10.88]So, I'm sorry we're stuck here until I beat this fucking game.
[154:15.62]Look at this.
[154:16.06]We're way too deep right now.
[154:18.85]I can only go up and to the right.
[154:35.04]No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[154:39.28]This is Donald Duck all over again?
[154:40.78]No, I love, I just need to beat, let me just beat a boss.
[154:45.93]No, wrong door!
[154:48.93]Oh, it's already dead.
[154:54.41]Ow, whatever.
[154:57.68]Ooh.
[155:01.42]Alright.
[155:02.48]Don't have this yet.
[155:04.32]That's a faith room.
[155:06.90]Here we go.
[155:10.82]You don't need God in your day-to-day life, only in emergencies.
[155:15.82]I think we have this one.
[155:19.63]It's the one where, like, I'm the vine and you're the... whatever.
[155:22.47]There it is.
[155:40.59]Oh, dear god, this is an emergency.
[155:44.66]Alright, there's another verse over here.
[155:50.04]Let's get it.
[155:51.52]Okay.
[156:11.59]What does that mean?
[156:28.42]This game is fucking stupid.
[156:31.34]This game is fucking really dumb.
[156:34.61]I'm just piecing this together right now.
[156:43.77]for like 40 minutes it's starting to click it's actually starting to hit me now if Jesus comes again who cares it won't affect us okay that's uh where is it
[157:10.59]You know when you do something for long enough that you forgot that you've been doing it for that long, and then you're kind of like, why have I been doing this for this long?
[157:20.74]It's starting to creep up.
[157:22.38]And, like, the music is... Keep me... Okay, Jesus comes back, who cares?
[157:34.03]It's this one.
[157:35.67]No.
[157:35.89]No.
[157:40.26]Which one is it?
[157:45.58]I was just on it.
[157:46.22]There we go.
[157:56.21]Then it will be reward each person, right?
[157:57.75]This is the one, right?
[158:03.66]Vital Power!
[158:14.42]Watch out for false prophets.
[158:15.74]They come to you in sheep's clothing.
[158:17.58]And there we go.
[158:18.28]We just completed that quest.
[158:22.67]Done.
[158:24.23]Quest completed.
[158:27.13]Let's do it.
[158:29.36]But first, where's that prayer room?
[158:44.11]Up.
[158:44.89]Left.
[158:45.41]Down.
[158:47.03]Left.
[158:47.45]Right.
[158:47.87]Up.
[158:48.45]Left.
[158:48.79]Down.
[158:49.23]Whatever.
[158:49.59]I'll find it.
[158:58.90]Down.
[158:59.42]Right.
[158:59.74]Down.
[159:10.44]Left.
[159:12.78]Up.
[159:14.52]Left.
[159:16.82]Okay.
[159:18.53]I'm back.
[159:19.79]I've got more things in my Bible computer.
[159:27.21]The Bible says there's no such thing as reincarnation.
[159:33.07]Where is it?
[159:33.49]It's like if you die, you die once, right?
[159:36.05]What does it say?
[159:36.49]It's one of these.
[159:44.81]There it is.
[159:47.41]Okay.
[159:49.11]And then this is the angel's one.
[159:53.47]Which is this one?
[159:54.62]No, this one.
[159:56.84]Okay, then we have the next one.
[159:58.38]Here it comes.
[159:59.40]Are we ready?
[160:03.50]Do not listen to a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[160:10.78]It was Matthew... Here we go.
[160:13.73]Done.
[160:15.46]Your new lamb is nothing but a fake, and he just wants to use you.
[160:18.38]He wants to use you up.
[160:24.85]That's kind of scary.
[160:26.59]He's a false Christ.
[160:28.65]He lied to me.
[160:29.31]That means that God lied to me.
[160:31.83]No, no, no, no.
[160:32.55]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[160:33.65]God, even though that man was unfaithful and lied to you, that doesn't mean that God's a liar.
[160:40.40]Oh, shit.
[160:41.18]Uh-oh.
[160:46.37]This is kind of backfiring on me.
[160:49.03]Even though that man was unfaithful, God isn't a liar.
[160:57.42]Here, take some bread.
[160:59.32]A man cannot live on bread alone.
[161:01.03]No.
[161:05.19]Uh...
[161:21.29]I already did this one.
[161:32.50]Wait.
[161:35.02]What if some did not have faith?
[161:36.28]Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?
[161:38.74]Not at all.
[161:39.16]Let God be true and every man a liar.
[161:43.04]Got it.
[161:48.47]Uh-oh.
[161:50.38]Not everyone believes in God, but that doesn't affect him.
[161:53.12]Just because men lie and deceive, that doesn't mean that God lies.
[161:57.02]Lots of people lie.
[162:01.24]So I can still trust God?
[162:03.18]Yes, he will never lie to you.
[162:08.96]Thank you for showing me the truth.
[162:11.02]Is there anything I can do to help you?
[162:14.26]Yes, I will need your help to operate the Unibot.
[162:17.32]Do you know where it is?
[162:19.07]Uh-huh.
[162:19.75]It's at the north end of the city.
[162:22.17]Do you know how to get to the rest of the city?
[162:25.21]Yes, and I have the verse that unlocks the door that leads to it.
[162:28.29]I kept it locked to try to keep the cybers out.
[162:31.45]Here it is.
[162:33.10]Ask, and it will be given to you.
[162:35.20]Seek, and you will find.
[162:36.96]Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[162:42.38]Thanks.
[162:42.68]Where's the door?
[162:43.76]Right outside the room.
[162:45.36]Alright, goodbye.
[162:49.11]It's this door right here!
[162:52.98]I did it!
[162:55.04]Let's go!
[163:01.77]Ding ding!
[163:05.17]Alright, where's the boss?
[163:20.89]They mentioned the next part of the city.
[163:28.36]So why am I not dealing with all these robots?
[163:30.42]Why am I just running by them?
[163:32.16]Okay, I'm just getting spawned on.
[163:33.44]That was just five in a row.
[163:39.48]No, this is it.
[163:40.00]Uh-oh.
[163:46.12]Uh...
[163:49.22]By the way, this is... I'm gonna make a Chrono Trigger reference.
[163:54.96]This is the very first hour of the game.
[163:57.84]You're on a bridge like this and you fight a boss.
[163:59.88]It's almost the exact same background, the exact same bridge, the exact same door.
[164:04.68]I need to reference it because it's one of my favorite video games ever made.
[164:11.60]Oh, fuck.
[164:12.52]Okay.
[164:13.58]So there's like five areas.
[164:15.80]Which one do I want to go to?
[164:16.76]What the hell is that?
[164:28.54]Which way do I want to go?
[164:33.96]Should I try to go up there?
[164:35.00]Alright, let me just see if I can get up there.
[164:37.01]Alright.
[164:56.50]So what is up here?
[165:04.00]Are you shitting me?
[165:05.98]I get to get into a giga... You guys wanted me to leave the game.
[165:09.65]I'm about to pilot... a gigantic... Megazord.
[165:17.09]So this is the unit bot that I need to destroy the Tower of Deception.
[165:20.75]Testing, testing, is anyone here?
[165:22.07]Hey, it's Captain Bible!
[165:27.86]We plan to use this unit bot to get rid of the Dome of Darkness.
[165:31.78]Hmm, yes, I knew that would be a good idea.
[165:34.91]Who the hell was that?
[165:37.59]We need six more people to work this system.
[165:40.37]I have to go find more help.
[165:43.61]Oh, no.
[165:44.89]I need six more people?
[165:48.73]That armor is made out of gold.
[165:50.03]Alright, let me just see what it looks like.
[165:52.70]Okay, well, this is over.
[165:56.16]I'm done with this one.
[166:00.22]Do I have to do everything what I was just doing six more times?
[166:04.77]Holy shit.
[166:05.97]Don't think so.
[166:08.83]Uh... What is all this?
[166:13.83]Do I have to get the whole Bible?
[166:15.67]I just... I want to see what's over... What is this?
[166:29.74]I need to see what's over there.
[166:35.97]If you don't beat this game, you're gonna go to hell.
[166:41.11]Oh boy, I'm almost dead.
[166:42.28]I'm dead.
[166:49.20]Don't give up.
[166:50.54]Don't give up!
[166:52.64]Use reincarnation!
[167:08.51]That's it.
[167:09.99]That's it.
[167:14.98]That's it for that one.
[167:16.18]That was fun, though.
[167:24.42]What was the next one?
[167:25.00]Oh, we still don't know.
[167:27.12]Oh, yeah.
[167:27.82]Why did this change?
[167:29.46]Wasn't this over here?
[167:35.78]At least I got jumbled around.
[167:38.22]Alright, I... You ready?

[200:34.86]Alright, I can't look at it anymore.
[200:40.58]It hurts.
[200:45.43]I'm sorry about that.

[200:58.05]We did Donald Duck's Playground, so I think it was...
[201:02.09]If I scroll here, I think?
[201:09.64]Yeah, this makes sense.
[201:11.56]Let's take a look.
[201:14.24]Right here, I think?
[201:21.43]Right?
[201:22.79]No, it was right here.
[201:24.37]We already did Donald Duck's Playground, so we're not going to do it.
[201:29.27]So don't click it.
[201:33.78]Yeah, I know what you saw down there.
[201:35.36]I know.
[201:36.04]I saw it too.
[201:40.52]Where are we going?
[201:46.67]Where did you get?
[201:47.13]What are you guys clicking?
[201:55.91]Let's go to the fortress.
[201:57.43]This is very spread out.
[201:58.49]We're not going to Donald Duck's playground.
[202:00.15]I already did it.
[202:14.88]Bouncing bait.

[204:06.77]Where are we?
[204:07.60]Pick again.
[204:08.52]That was just like, trampoline bounce into the right side of the screen.
[204:23.82]Alright, hey, I picked a couple of bad ones, but... Bouncing Babies was just... I don't know, guys.
[204:29.94]Come on.
[204:30.38]That was on you.
[204:34.64]WWF WrestleMania.
[204:40.34]Yours were way worse.
[204:42.40]No, they weren't.
[204:44.56]Bouncing Babies and Bar Tapper can't tell each other out because they were the same color scheme and they were both equally as just, like, hard to look at.
[204:52.97]Alright, we're going to do WWF.
[204:55.61]I missed some community subs from earlier.
[204:58.02]AdventureMFDan gave five subs.
[205:01.68]We also had AMClockwork gave five subs earlier.
[205:07.02]I wanted to make sure I didn't miss that.
[205:10.58]So thank you, both of you.
[205:12.40]And let's go WWF WrestleMania.
[205:21.03]If it'll open.
[205:24.79]And it will.
[205:29.01]What do we got?
[205:30.83]Hulk Hogan, Hulkamania, and the Hulkster are trademarks of Marvel Entertainment Group.
[205:37.20]Wait, Hulk Hogan is a Marvel character?
[205:42.74]Since when?
[205:50.03]Get him in the MCU.
[205:57.36]I did not know that.
[205:58.10]That's odd.
[206:02.22]Compete for belt or practice?
[206:08.53]Uh... Well, okay.
[206:10.01]It's Q and A is up and down, it seems.
[206:13.95]Let's practice first.
[206:17.81]Who are we gonna be?
[206:19.95]Hulk... Hulkster.
[206:22.46]Uh... Weight 3... Hulk Hogan was not 300 pounds.
[206:27.21]I can assure you of that.
[206:35.20]I guess we're going to be Hulk Hogan.
[206:46.09]This is taking a long time to load.
[206:51.99]Holy shit.
[206:52.73]This is the...
[206:56.05]This is the game, this is the... I love this game!
[206:59.21]This game is in the arcade!
[207:00.49]This game is fucking unbelievable!
[207:02.85]This game is one of the best games in the arcade.
[207:05.48]I've been looking for this for a long, long time.
[207:09.76]Okay, this... Okay, I got grab.
[207:14.78]Space is grab.
[207:16.12]What is left and right?
[207:25.05]Q and A is up and down.
[207:27.77]W, E, R, Z, X, C, Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Q. There's a grab.
[207:43.19]So why is it doing two player controls?
[207:46.49]I didn't select two player.
[207:53.61]I mean, I'm hitting every single button.
[207:55.11]Number pad?
[207:55.55]Alright, well, number pad works over here.
[208:03.25]Space is punch, but weirdly enough, I can't find left or right.
[208:09.81]Match over.
[208:10.25]I mean, I am just dragging across the keyboard.
[208:14.36]The arrow keys were controlling Mr. Perfect.
[208:31.74]I don't think I can control this game.
[208:33.39]J and L. No, I don't think so.
[208:36.77]You would think if Q and A is up and down.
[208:39.75]Oh, this sucks.
[208:40.33]I love this game.
[208:42.35]The number pad?
[208:43.13]The number pad was for Player 2.
[208:44.43]This was in the arcades, if I remember.
[208:49.17]Period and comma?
[208:50.59]No.
[208:52.29]Unless it's like a capital?
[208:53.59]No.
[208:56.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[208:56.84]What was that?
[208:57.26]That was just like U. Okay, that was O.
[209:00.33]Alright, Q, A, O, and P. I think there's only three wrestlers.
[209:09.41]Alright, I'm gonna be the ultimate warrior.
[209:14.58]Q, A, O, and P. You might be big.
[209:21.60]You might be strong.
[209:26.21]You might look good.
[209:31.29]But you just ain't perfect.
[209:39.96]You, Mr. Oh, hold on.
[209:41.48]I have to select a reply.
[209:43.42]You, Mr. Perfect, will feel the power of the Ultimate Warrior and you will yield to that power.
[209:49.64]Yes, I am strong, but the strongest and biggest muscle I have is the heart that pumps the love of all my warriors, and that will spell your ultimate doom.
[209:58.93]Let us put your body to the ultimate test, because I can promise that the result will not be perfect for you.
[210:05.85]Let's rally up the crowd.
[210:07.75]Oh, I don't want to see this whole thing.
[210:10.74]They say nobody's perfect.
[210:16.91]but then they say the exception proves the rule.
[210:31.22]Alright, you're dead.
[210:40.20]He's speaking in riddles, yeah.
[210:42.08]Alright, where's he going?
[210:47.44]Why is this faster now?
[210:52.34]What does it want me to do?
[210:53.96]This is the game, by the way.
[210:54.90]There's a chair rider.
[211:02.01]How do I get back in the ring?
[211:04.09]He has the chair now.
[211:09.63]This is the game.
[211:15.88]It's so fast!
[211:27.47]I'm fighting like four imaginary people and him.
[211:30.11]O and P being left and right is fucking me up so hard.
[211:46.42]Dude, I gotta go to the chair.
[211:47.48]Give me the chair.
[211:52.50]Out, out, out.
[211:52.90]Give me the chair.
[212:01.10]Get back out here.
[212:14.82]Alright.
[212:15.30]It's going to come out.
[212:33.53]Alright, go, go, get out, get out, get out!
[212:35.27]I win!
[212:45.88]It looks like you lost and I won.
[212:51.34]That's not what happened.
[212:54.72]Now that's what I'd call absolutely perfect.
[213:03.02]Then you get counted out?
[213:09.10]How did I lose that?
[213:13.72]You might be big.
[213:16.05]Alright, I'm just doing like Christopher Walken.
[213:17.79]Why did I lose?
[213:19.95]I did not... How did I get counted out?
[213:21.61]I was in the fucking ring when I went to 18.
[213:30.57]You can't win the belt on a countout.
[213:32.33]Yes, you can.
[213:33.63]Who made up that rule?
[213:34.47]Was it because I grabbed the chair?
[213:35.49]I think I have to hit left and right.
[213:42.69]Yeah, it's left.
[213:54.01]He just, like, flipped me.
[214:01.66]Let's go.
[214:13.95]I'm not hurting myself, am I?
[214:17.43]How?
[214:17.59]I don't understand that.
[214:18.37]I have to go left and right and spam?
[214:25.19]Holy shit, I get it.
[214:26.03]I get it.
[214:26.43]I have to hit left and right really fast.
[214:34.09]I can't do it.
[214:42.72]That's hurting my arm.
[214:48.17]I almost had it!
[214:48.59]Alright, I'll sit here and go OP OP OP OP OP OP OP OP OP OP OP OP.
[215:22.73]Dude, that's impossible.
[215:24.14]It's going too fast.
[215:24.88]I gotta slow it down.
[215:26.86]Is that better?
[215:27.24]I feel like that's better.
[215:34.44]How do I run through the ropes?
[215:36.37]Is it double tap?
[215:52.65]Is this- I- I- there's no way.
[215:55.51]I need like a controller.
[215:56.96]Q A O P and space.
[216:18.80]Alright, I don't- I really don't- We're just gonna play Pac-Man right now.
[216:22.49]It's River's Choice.
[216:23.17]It's gonna be a good one.
[216:24.19]Trust me.
[216:35.50]Is- Is Pac in time?
[216:39.02]Is this- I feel like I've played this one.
[216:41.56]Not on stream, but before.
[216:47.43]Mmmmm.
[216:50.35]This is what I'm talking about.
[217:03.80]Our hero Pac-Man has not always been the cool video game dude we know and love.
[217:10.04]only because the evil Ghost Witch and her flunkies, the Ghost Monsters, invaded his world, was Pac-Man forced to survive 50 many crazy events.
[217:24.11]Since then, Pac-Man has lived happily with Mrs. Pac-Man and their two cute Pac-Kids.
[217:35.33]Who's that?
[217:36.01]What?
[218:12.10]The journey back in time transformed Pac-Man into a young Pac-Boy.
[218:17.70]The Ghost Witch sent Pac to 1975, a world which has never heard of the hero Pac-Man.
[218:25.59]Through the Witch's foul magic, the inhabitants of a once beautiful land have turned against him.
[218:33.36]Commanding this mystical horde are the Ghost Witches' loyal ghosts.
[218:37.34]They are a Pax worst nightmare, and will do everything possible to keep Pax prisoner.
[218:43.22]What's with the spacing here?
[218:46.20]To escape this distorted past and return to this beloved family, Pac-Man must traverse this hazardous land and penetrate the castle.
[218:53.95]Within it stands the portal of time Pax only hoped to return to present.
[219:07.20]Let's go!
[219:08.28]New game!
[219:09.40]Game A!
[219:09.86]Desert.
[219:10.18]The desert.
[219:10.94]I've never played this before.
[219:36.12]That was interesting.
[219:37.04]What was that?
[219:37.34]I wanted to see that for more than a second.
[219:41.43]Wait, am I just playing on the beach?
[219:45.87]Shouldn't I be a little bit more distraught?
[219:47.47]Why do I look like I weigh a lot?
[219:54.21]What?! !
[220:03.94]Why can Fatman do Kamehameha?
[220:07.87]Let's go!
[220:08.19]Oops.
[220:09.15]So there's a double jump.
[220:10.65]Kind of.
[220:13.31]Ooh, okay.
[220:14.55]Jump.
[220:38.39]Is that it?
[220:39.07]Wait, wait.
[220:39.57]Let me try something else.
[220:43.03]It's bunny hopping, guys.
[220:47.41]It's momentum with bunny hops.
[220:48.35]Alright, anything else I need to know?
[220:51.81]Down.
[220:52.79]Space.
[220:53.98]Alt.
[220:54.68]Z. Like anything else?
[220:55.98]I don't think so.
[221:06.40]Is this what the 70s were like?
[221:07.74]That's a good question.
[221:08.76]I feel like I'm going too fast!
[221:09.90]This is awesome!
[221:39.27]What is that?
[221:39.81]Oh, I hit my head?
[222:09.36]Watch out for the spider!
[222:11.74]It's all this water!
[222:15.43]Can I swim?
[222:19.15]How do you swim?
[222:20.63]Swim?
[222:22.95]Is there a way I can go- How do I- Do I have to drain the water?
[222:39.78]Ooh, it's Alt.
[222:40.58]This is so much fun.
[222:43.84]Just drain all the air from my lungs.
[222:47.69]It's turning into Kirby.
[223:08.93]Am I out of the water?
[223:17.58]What other power-ups can I get?
[223:18.58]Wait, this is a vine?
[223:25.52]That hurts.
[223:26.14]That's really loud and it hurts.
[223:29.32]Oh, that hurts to listen to.
[223:35.76]What?
[223:36.80]Come on.
[223:38.81]Bullshit.
[223:39.59]I'm only gonna do that when I need to, because it hurts.
[223:46.85]Look at how happy he is, I know, it's great.
[223:53.59]I didn't even let go!
[223:54.33]What?
[223:54.55]Is it timed?
[223:56.47]I'm also alive!
[223:57.19]Where's it gonna go?
[223:58.35]Right there.
[224:10.17]Oh my god!
[224:10.95]Okay, it's when you touch anything.
[224:13.29]I wanna- I wanna control over this so bad.
[224:26.38]That's- alright.
[224:27.42]I'm telling you, doing this with a keyboard, it's not easy.
[224:30.12]It's like, it's really awkward.
[224:46.77]Oh, that's not good.
[224:47.66]That's it.
[224:48.02]I'm doing it again.
[224:50.14]I'm doing it again.
[224:52.38]I can do it again.
[224:54.26]This is gonna go fast.
[224:56.08]Watch this.
[225:16.72]Come on, hurry up.
[225:28.61]Oh, yes!
[225:28.79]I actually start here.
[225:29.55]That's perfect.
[225:30.11]Oh, what an awesome game.
[225:32.13]This game is old- I didn't even touch anything!
[225:34.43]What?!
[225:34.66]Come on!
[225:36.12]Alright, easy.
[225:36.54]Just right here.
[225:47.58]Why can't... Is something wrong?
[225:49.92]Why is it not sticking?
[225:54.98]Uh... Well, okay, there's something wrong now.
[226:00.91]Something's wrong.
[226:06.53]Do I have to jump first?
[226:08.75]I can't just attach?
[226:13.57]I guess I have to jump first.
[226:18.83]Alright, now easy.
[226:19.43]I have to jump over you.
[226:25.31]You gotta double jump over that guy.
[226:27.97]So it's double jump over the scorpion.
[226:32.38]Shoot him?
[226:32.94]I don't have a... I can't shoot him.
[226:35.24]I don't have that power-up.
[226:36.26]I have the E.
[226:58.31]Here we go.
[226:58.92]Nope.
[227:06.51]Watch out!
[227:07.43]Oh, fuck!
[227:08.23]I knew it was there too.
[227:09.51]I knew I could feel it.
[227:28.59]Wait, should I just do this?
[227:32.73]Alright, I got it.
[227:36.27]Nice.
[227:36.73]No!
[227:37.33]Fuck, I can't believe it.
[227:38.69]I can't believe it.
[227:40.17]I have to play this again.
[227:42.97]I have to do this again.
[227:44.23]I really like this.
[227:46.35]How did I land perfectly on the spike?
[227:49.91]That's insane.
[227:52.15]I just, I jumped and it didn't grab.
[227:55.49]Yeah, the bottom left is what I have for power-ups.
[228:20.74]Grab it!
[228:21.02]Alright, there again?
[228:30.39]Can I- can I eat this?
[228:37.35]Watch out!
[228:43.31]I'm so fucking- Alright- DAH!
[229:01.28]No, look at this!
[229:02.24]Oh my god!
[229:05.89]Okay.
[229:06.35]I can do it again.
[229:07.65]I didn't think it was gonna be free.
[229:31.38]Is there a speedrun of this game?
[229:32.28]I feel like I'd want to see it.
[229:41.03]Playing on the beach.
[229:42.83]What's this called?
[229:43.75]This is called, uh, pack in time.
[229:46.23]Uh, now I do have power-ups.
[230:00.85]Alright, slow down.
[230:04.27]I can't- Okay, I have to land first.
[230:05.65]Come on, grab it.
[230:19.56]OH!
[230:20.06]I can.
[230:20.68]Fuck.
[230:21.34]Let's just jump it.
[230:24.46]That's hard to control that.
[230:27.36]It's really hard.
[230:30.41]It's like, okay, you know what it reminds me of?
[230:33.29]The ninja rope in, uh, Worms.
[230:46.85]Oh my god.
[230:49.25]It controls just like it, too.
[230:53.43]Except it's like a worse version somehow.
[231:15.46]Alright, I can't grab anything.
[231:16.86]Gotta go one, two, three!
[231:21.66]Alright, power up.
[231:22.74]I gotta shoot something.
[231:23.64]Uh, no vine.
[231:24.16]Vine is gone.
[231:44.10]Oh shit, I thought that was a platform.
[231:48.40]Oh, did I get it?
[232:02.19]No vine?
[232:02.67]I got the vine, nice.
[232:10.50]Oh, I tried to bull myself up there.
[232:29.33]Alright, that's how you get the vine.
[232:30.27]Let's go up here.
[232:32.39]Okay.
[232:34.57]I have to do twice.
[232:41.09]Oh my god.
[232:41.83]It's fine, I'm good.
[232:43.89]Alright, what's over here?
[232:46.35]I gotta jump, and then, uh... Stop!
[232:49.17]Okay, we're good.
[232:51.55]A breeze.
[233:02.69]How much more of the desert are we doing?
[233:05.51]I'm gonna go... Let's go.
[233:12.58]Don't go crazy.
[233:20.64]What's this?
[233:22.72]Whoa.
[233:25.27]A clock?
[233:25.85]Can I get that clock?
[233:29.43]There's a 1UP down there.
[233:42.42]Okay, I can't kill this.
[233:44.12]Wow, that was... okay.
[233:45.25]I clearly made it over that.
[233:48.75]One... two... three... out!
[234:15.99]Let's see if I can snipe him.
[234:17.42]Alright, did I get him?
[234:46.19]Go down?
[234:46.99]Or... I guess I could eat?
[234:48.17]No, it's only two globs.
[234:49.55]I don't need it.
[234:51.05]Wait.
[234:51.25]Secret?
[234:51.51]Oh, nice.
[235:24.35]Shit, I was trying to grab the last two.
[235:26.95]Sorry.
[235:34.98]What?
[235:35.28]I thought that was a background image.
[235:36.82]Come on.
[235:52.77]Ah, come on, just turn!
[235:54.73]This looks like a ramp.
[236:10.26]Oh my god, I thought it was a fucking background image again.
[236:16.81]It's alright.
[236:17.75]Infinite continues.
[236:38.03]I like this one.
[236:38.79]I love how I don't have to do any- I don't have to start over, that's great.
[237:02.60]Okay, slow down.
[237:03.40]How am I gonna jump over this, though?
[237:09.40]I didn't make it last time.
[237:10.36]I don't have to mine.
[237:38.19]Backwards long jump.
[237:39.07]Frame perfect, it was.
[237:40.07]Alright, so I gotta go... eat through?
[237:44.28]No.
[237:44.42]I can move this.
[237:45.16]Okay, interesting.
[238:09.96]Not quite.
[238:15.46]No, shit!
[238:17.70]Wait!
[238:18.42]I can't go down, I don't have the air bubble.
[238:24.44]There's a secret over here I can't get.
[238:41.15]Oh, I promise this is way harder than it looks.
[238:43.51]Why did it not grab?
[238:53.82]No, stop!
[238:56.80]I want to get that.
[239:04.10]No, I don't.
[239:05.20]Who cares?
[239:22.70]holy shit I don't have any um power we gotta jump
[239:50.07]What?
[239:51.93]Oh, shit.
[239:52.91]Okay, the thing shoots little green pellets out of the wall.
[240:01.20]Okay, dude, that's gonna be fucking hard to do.
[240:05.42]Because you have to stay bouncing.
[240:07.24]Okay.
[240:18.96]Yeah, okay, let me show you something.
[240:20.82]Ready?
[240:21.00]Alright, I'm not jumping right now.
[240:23.64]There's, like, there's bounce momentum.
[240:26.46]I'm not, like, hitting the jump button.
[240:27.88]I'm just gonna vine up.
[240:53.27]Stop bouncing.
[240:54.12]I can't help it.
[240:54.86]It's doing it.
[240:56.40]I'm not pressing that button.
[241:06.58]Go up.
[241:07.76]Oh, God.
[241:09.10]Alright, I'm done.
[241:13.79]That game, it's fun, but I'm not doing it anymore.
[241:16.59]That's a fun game.
[241:27.52]What's next?
[241:33.25]Didn't even beat the desert.
[241:36.67]Alright, where are we going down here?
[241:41.25]Uh, we got... Let's see.
[241:43.98]Is there anything else here to do?
[241:46.08]I mean, maybe Popeye.
[241:55.82]There is a Mario down there.
[241:57.68]That's why I can't scroll.
[241:59.16]I don't want you to see.
[242:01.76]Spoilers.
[242:06.14]Well, everybody was clicking on Popeye, so I'm just going to do it.
[242:15.18]Watch the bounce physics in this one.
[242:30.66]Popeye?
[242:31.46]Popeye.
[242:32.12]Popeye.
[242:39.07]Popeye 2, actually.
[242:40.51]Popeye 2.
[242:45.77]Loading level 1.
[242:46.43]Oh, that was weird.
[242:49.39]Uh, alright, first, I thought, is that Popeye?
[242:53.85]I thought that was Popeye's foot down there.
[242:59.01]Is this a Rube Goldberg machine?
[243:00.55]Uh, I can't climb up the ladder.
[243:15.42]Control?
[243:16.22]I can't- A?
[243:17.26]Okay, apparently- Is it- This is just Donkey Kong, but zoomed way to fucking-
[243:39.26]No, I want to go up.
[243:52.43]Uh...
[243:55.13]I don't know what the interact button is.
[243:56.59]I tried Alt, Ctrl, A, Space.
[243:59.52]I have to go up, but then I have to go up there.
[244:06.46]Alt, A, Alt, Space.
[244:09.34]Space is jump.
[244:12.56]What's the cat do?
[244:26.04]Popeye, okay, from this angle, it looks like Popeye has just bones.
[244:29.68]He's like a skeleton.
[244:30.50]He's really skinny.
[244:31.78]You can see, like, the top part of his rib cage.
[244:34.20]And then his spine.
[244:39.10]Uh... Q. W. S. Uh... Escape.
[244:51.11]Alright, let's move on.
[244:54.78]Was there anything else here that you guys wanted to see?
[245:05.76]Because we were right here.
[245:06.52]What do you guys think?
[245:18.40]Christmas lemmings?
[245:20.50]Wait, wait.
[245:21.29]What just happened to the clicking?
[245:28.02]What website is this?
[245:28.76]This is the archive.org MS-DOS dump.
[245:35.91]There are 4,000 plus MS-DOS games.
[245:41.57]There are a lot of them.
[245:44.26]Some of them are better than others.
[245:46.08]Some of them are not.
[245:46.88]Some of them are good.
[245:48.12]Some of them are bad.
[245:48.72]Alright, we're going to do Christmas Lemmings.
[245:54.16]This is probably going to be like a 30 second and then we leave.
[245:58.66]Because Lemmings... Last time we tried to play Lemmings, it didn't work.
[246:02.26]Twice.
[246:07.85]Okay.
[246:09.97]Here we go.
[246:14.17]X Miss Lemmings.
[246:18.83]F1 is one player.
[246:22.25]F3 is music.
[246:23.64]Oh, it's on.
[246:24.00]It should be on.
[246:26.40]F4 are controls.
[246:31.15]Mouse.
[246:33.81]No, that's not going to work.
[246:34.92]It's not picking it up in the emulator.
[246:36.14]Alright, what's going to be keyboard?
[246:39.40]Alright, one player.
[246:41.00]Christmas Lemmings.

[246:47.88]Alright.
[246:51.89]No, we're fine.
[246:53.73]Where are they coming from?
[246:58.00]Plus and minus.
[246:59.68]1, 2, 3, 4.
[247:00.76]Space.
[247:02.02]Alt.
[247:04.96]Space.
[247:06.00]Down.
[247:07.52]Left, right.
[247:08.02]Q. Anything happening?

[247:30.01]They're all just going to walk around in a circle.
[247:32.85]1 through 9.
[247:35.07]Doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[247:39.42]The cursor is moving?
[247:45.68]Where?
[247:45.94]There's a cursor in the top left.
[247:53.38]I don't... Press down.
[247:58.96]No, it's not doing anything.
[248:01.97]Above the dancing Santa.

[277:54.68]What is the price of this 14 karat small link gold necklace?

[278:57.95]So that price changed from two games ago.
[279:04.29]Okay, so that's bullshit.
[279:05.47]This whole game is rigged.
[279:07.76]From four items shown, select two whose prices, when added together, will equal the show price.
[279:14.76]So they're going to show four items, and two of those items added are the price shown.
[279:20.96]Item one, item two.
[279:24.95]Item one is this remote control toy car.
[279:28.29]Item two is a pair of kids' plastic sunglasses.
[279:33.38]So we've got a remote control car, a pair of shitty sunglasses, a football, a leather football, and a 640K computer with two drives.
[279:45.44]Well, this is going to be fucking impossible.
[279:49.79]It's obviously the computer.
[279:52.61]Because, um...
[279:59.71]Okay, so the plastic shades have to be a dollar or two, right?

[280:44.75]Okay.
[280:45.19]Well, I would just... Who cares if you don't go to the showcase?
[280:47.67]Just take the five grand.
[280:50.79]That's really good takeaway.

[281:43.35]Oh yeah!
[281:43.63]Wait, I don't want to spin it again.
[282:00.23]How do I say I don't want to spin it again?
[282:11.70]There was no option for me to say no?
[282:21.19]That was my most powerful spin.
[282:29.41]Oh, this is for bonus money.
[282:30.35]Oh, right, right, right.
[282:31.03]Okay.
[282:31.23]I don't know what for.

[282:32.99]65.
[282:33.09]70.
[282:33.13]You guys said it was for the bonus.
[282:44.35]What?
[282:44.61]I don't... What the... What the fuck is that?
[282:48.89]Why couldn't I say no?
[282:50.77]I can't... I... He didn't... He had a choice to not spin it again.
[282:54.44]Where was my choice?
[282:58.45]If this dickhead wins with 10 cents,
[283:42.26]I mean, come on.
[283:44.74]I don't understand what this is.
[283:50.46]This is Virtual Mario.
[284:01.29]That was a jump scare face.
[284:06.49]What?
[284:11.53]Um, keys used during all map screens.
[284:14.51]The four arrow keys work for movement in the direction they indicate.

[285:18.46]Uh, okay.
[285:21.01]I think I understand.
[285:24.99]Read the story.
[285:27.73]The Mushroom Kingdom is in great morn ever since the governor of the Mushroom Kingdom had received an urgent stress call from Princess Toadstool.
[285:36.88]His daughter of Princess Toadstool.
[285:43.01]Accompanied by Luigi for her safety, we're making trips across the land looking for mystery super mushrooms.
[285:52.25]The call was made from the royal family's submarine somewhere near the northern hemisphere of the planet called Yoshi's World.
[286:01.06]The message was simple.
[286:01.86]The princess and Luigi were trapped on the shore of Lake Amherst, where their submarine had been wrecked by a violent storm at sea.
[286:10.20]This is where Mario's role comes to play.
[286:12.80]Mario must make his way to Lake Amherst to- Alright, enough!
[286:18.55]To rescue the princess and Luigi.
[286:23.16]why does Mario have to do the job you ask well when bowser heard word about the princess and luigi being stranded on the shore of lake Amherst he sent his goons out to stop any I can still hear it stop any rescue ships from coming to the rescue it seems bowser is up to his no good
[286:43.39]The only one who is capable of beating Bowser's good goons and rescuing the princess and Luigi.
[286:49.24]By the way, Luigi forgot his fire flower at home.
[286:53.04]Leaving him powerless against Bowser's goons.
[286:55.74]Is Mario.
[286:56.74]This is still going.
[287:01.08]This situation would not be as bad as it... By the way, I'm trying to read this.
[287:05.54]The purple text with no outline on this background is... I have to cross my eyes.
[287:13.29]The situation would not be as bad as if it would be... However, Mario was just recently taking a vacation from just... Had rescued the princess from Bowser a month earlier.
[287:22.76]Is not in the area, Yoshi's World.
[287:25.22]As such, Mario must travel from the planet he is now on to Yoshi's World.
[287:29.60]Four planets away.
[287:30.54]However, he must stop... This is predictive text.
[287:33.92]I feel like I wrote this on an iPhone.
[287:35.66]Line by line.
[287:36.79]He must stop on each planet to pick up the key, which only then can he continue his journey...
[287:42.43]On the next planet, Bowser is also making his way through, therefore Mario must battle against Bowser's goons.
[287:48.91]Time is against Mario as he must make it to the submarine wreck, Princess and Luigi, before Bowser does.
[287:54.78]Will Mario become the hero once again?
[287:58.18]Okay.
[287:58.36]Is that an E?
[288:17.22]Welcome to my shore Forty twenty dollars forty dollars fifty dollars How much money do I have
[288:42.37]Fifty dollars?
[288:44.01]P?
[288:44.29]I don't think I have any money.
[288:45.77]The turtles don't have heads!
[288:56.08]Wait, how do I talk?
[288:58.26]What is talk?
[289:13.40]It's me, Mario!
[289:14.88]Was it O?
[289:15.64]H. It's me, Mario!
[289:18.41]Why can I go higher sometimes?
[289:22.29]It's me, Mario!
[289:44.61]I just can't... I'm trying to jump on his head.
[289:53.34]Why can't I attack?
[289:55.24]Why can't I attack?
[289:59.98]Oh my god.
[290:04.24]What do I do?
[290:05.34]How do I talk?
[290:06.08]How do I do anything?
[290:32.35]Other way.
[290:32.67]There's different planets?
[290:42.56]I have to do this one.
[290:45.06]Alright, seriously, there's gotta be a way.
[290:46.86]I'm gonna try to jump on his head.
[290:50.46]Just wait till he falls, and then I can jump real high over here.
[290:53.84]Alright.
[290:56.24]I can't jump that high this way.
[290:57.56]There are keys.
[290:58.52]I got one key.
[291:05.65]I made it up here.
[291:06.71]Okay, I made it up.
[291:14.29]What is that thing?
[291:16.85]That's an enemy from Number Munchers.
[291:19.97]Come on, get up there.
[291:24.79]Fire Flower, get it!
[291:25.57]What?
[291:40.82]You can't jump.
[291:49.78]You cannot jump on enemies' heads.
[291:55.51]Okay.
[291:57.03]The other one that people wanted was life and death.
[292:03.65]Then we'll choose another one.
[292:05.59]Keep going.
[292:11.66]Life and Death.
[292:12.50]1988.

[293:06.58]I'm good.
[293:07.06]What about class?
[293:12.03]Welcome to Toolworks General Hospital.
[293:14.07]You're currently in the classroom.
[293:15.89]Whenever the chief of surgery feels that you need schooling, you'll be instructed to come here.
[293:20.56]When you're finished reading the blackboard, use your mouse or mouse substitute to click on the board.
[293:26.10]The instructor will then put up the next lesson.
[293:29.22]If you need to reread a lesson, click your mouse or mouse substitute at the very top of the blackboard.
[293:35.06]While making your rounds at Toolworks General, use your mouse or mouse substitute to enter and exit rooms by pointing and clicking at doors.
[293:42.51]You may also use the escape key to exit rooms.
[293:45.43]To leave the hospital, exit through the door at the far end of the hall.
[293:50.53]While you're in the hospital, you may request the hospital policies and guidelines clipboard by clicking on an intercom or by pressing the F1 key.
[293:57.97]Use the clipboard to set game parameters.
[294:00.92]You may not request this clipboard during surgery.
[294:04.57]To exit the classroom, click on the door behind the instructor or press escape.
[294:10.35]This concludes class for now.
[294:11.81]Thank you for attending.
[294:14.45]That's it.
[294:15.25]Okay, well.
[294:16.93]You have a patient in room one.
[294:18.62]That's the second door on your left.
[294:21.38]Good luck today.
[294:21.88]Happy Friday.
[294:24.02]What?
[294:26.90]What was that?
[294:29.56]Okay, what seems to be the problem?
[294:31.02]Let me open your present.
[294:34.67]Okay, we're just... What did I do?
[294:38.87]What?
[294:39.99]How did I go back?
[294:40.61]Did I just like... We're doing surgery?
[294:42.80]No, no, no, go back, go back, go back.
[294:44.38]Um... What?
[294:52.99]patient is a 59 year old male patient was admitted complaining of abdominal pain accompanied by generalized weakness nausea and a runny nose so I just like poked his stomach okay admitted of abdominal pain and weakness nausea and runny nose let's observe the patient and let's do it uh let's just let's just observe the patient for now no we are oh hold on
[295:20.97]I'm not going to operate.
[295:21.87]What's an ultra scan?
[295:25.97]Uh, referral.
[295:26.65]Somebody else will do this.
[295:27.39]No.
[295:28.94]Let's do an x-ray.
[295:33.64]Let's find out.
[295:34.14]Let's get an x-ray of your stomach and see if we can see anything.
[295:38.00]Is that the stomach?
[295:38.48]That's not the stomach.
[295:39.70]Alright, is there anything here?
[295:44.91]I didn't see anything.
[295:48.17]Observe.
[295:57.03]Your diagnosis and recommended treatment were incorrect, and you have been taken off the case.
[296:00.91]Report to medical school on the double.
[296:08.78]Dr. Wilson called from the lounge on line four.
[296:11.50]Medical school is the first door on your right.
[296:13.22]Better go now.
[296:13.84]Alright.
[296:19.51]When the nurse tells you that you have received a phone call, it is considered poor protocol not to return the call.
[296:24.50]You may use the phone on the front desk.
[296:26.50]Your beeper should tell you the correct extension to call.
[296:30.02]In your last case, your physical examination of the abdomen was incomplete.
[296:33.97]You must be sure to palpate all four quadrants of the abdomen, including the sides of the lower abdomen and the navel area for the exam to be effective.
[296:42.27]So wait, I didn't exam?
[296:45.20]In your last case, you ordered an unnecessary x-ray.
[296:47.40]The patient's symptoms did not indicate a need for an x-ray.
[296:50.43]Padding the hospital bill in this manner is frowned upon at Toolworks General.
[296:54.57]This concludes class for now.
[296:55.65]Thank you for attending.
[296:58.01]Okay, Dr. Wilson.
[296:59.71]On number four.
[297:01.69]Okay, call.
[297:04.75]Call from line four.
[297:10.74]How do I use the phone?
[297:14.93]Like 004?
[297:19.06]Number 4?
[297:22.94]It really is 0004.
[297:23.78]This is Dr. Wilson.
[297:27.74]Thanks for calling back.
[297:28.62]Keep sharp today.
[297:31.94]That's it.
[297:32.26]You have a patient in room 4.
[297:35.10]Last door on your right.
[297:36.72]Here we go.
[297:38.25]Are you sure?
[297:38.89]What are you talking about?
[297:41.69]She left.
[297:42.61]Last door on the right?
[297:46.48]Patient is 24-year-old male.
[297:47.50]Patient was admitted complaining of acute abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, cramping, and generalized weakness.
[297:52.65]Okay.
[297:54.87]Alright, let me take a look.
[297:58.19]That feels alright.
[298:00.03]No problems here.
[298:01.56]No pain there.
[298:02.76]That doesn't hurt.
[298:03.98]Right there.
[298:05.34]Right here?
[298:05.62]Alright, it's on the left side.
[298:08.36]Alright, I think that's the kidney, right?
[298:12.70]No, is that the gallbladder?
[298:13.81]Okay.
[298:14.83]Okay.
[298:17.58]So right here.
[298:18.40]That's like a side flank pain.
[298:20.26]What is that?
[298:22.50]Okay, so only down here in the lower left side of your stomach.
[298:31.41]I'm thinking we should lower left of the stomach flu-like symptoms.
[298:38.83]Maybe medication.
[298:41.11]Or maybe do an ultrasound.
[298:43.66]Or refer to a gastroenterologist.
[298:52.20]Maybe some pain relief?
[298:53.74]And then a referral.
[298:55.14]No.
[298:58.83]I would just, I would be, it would be a referral.
[299:06.81]What?
[299:07.79]Your recommended course of action was correct, but you did not follow the correct procedure.
[299:13.15]That was right!
[299:17.34]In your last case, your examination of the abdomen revealed that the patient was experiencing pain on both sides of the lower abdomen.
[299:24.06]Even though the appendix is on the right side, some appendicitis patients will experience pain on both sides during the examination.
[299:29.47]An x-ray is required.
[299:32.87]How the fuck was I supposed to know?
[299:34.89]Last throw on the left.
[299:41.11]They all have abdominal pain.
[299:43.27]Hey, I got an idea.
[299:44.57]Why don't we check the water?
[299:48.60]It's the third person with the same acute abdominal pain in the last 10 minutes.
[299:55.94]Flu-like symptoms.
[299:56.88]Okay, let's take a look.
[300:10.15]No pain.
[300:12.07]Okay, we've got no pain.
[300:24.77]no pain at all alright so no pain to touch which means you've got the flu medicaid what the
[300:46.24]Your last case, the examination of the patient revealed that the patient was not suffering from acute abdominal pain.
[300:50.54]Further observation of the patient is indicated as the usual cause of transient abdominal pain as an intestinal gas.
[301:05.70]Abdominal pain.
[301:06.64]Okay.
[301:07.78]Okay.
[301:10.32]Patients suffering from abdominal pain accompanied by flu-like symptoms.
[301:14.41]Nausea, generalized weakness, and dizziness.
[301:19.35]Alright, we got acute pain.
[301:24.75]On both sides.
[301:29.04]Anywhere else?
[301:31.02]Left and right.
[301:31.78]We're going to do an x-ray.
[301:34.08]Left and right.
[301:34.68]Right.
[301:37.79]Okay, I just want to confirm.
[301:38.79]Okay, we're good.
[301:40.61]X-ray.
[301:40.73]What does that show?
[301:50.05]Nothing?
[301:51.83]I think we're good.
[301:55.92]Nothing there.
[302:01.00]Observe.
[302:07.57]Operate.
[302:08.47]Ultra scan.
[302:10.73]Let's do an ultra scan.
[302:16.63]I don't know what that is.
[302:28.49]You get the screen pop up and the first thing the doctor says, I don't know what that is.
[302:34.03]You don't know what organ this is?
[302:40.83]Oh, wait, hold on.
[302:41.45]You, like, wiped the lens.
[302:42.21]Sorry, there was some mustard on there.
[302:45.99]I don't know what I'm looking at.
[302:50.81]I don't know what that is.
[302:55.73]Should I refer?
[302:56.27]Operate?
[302:58.35]No, what was I even looking at?
[303:02.07]That needs surgery.
[303:06.83]Wait, hold on.
[303:07.67]Operate.
[303:20.01]I can't operate?
[303:23.57]Referral.
[303:30.71]What?
[303:33.05]Wait, wait, wait, it just skipped it.
[303:34.38]It just skipped.
[303:34.84]What happened?
[303:38.12]What?
[303:43.34]Back to class.
[303:54.07]No kidney stones.
[303:55.01]Appendicitis is the correct diagnosis.
[303:58.87]Surgery should have been scheduled immediately.
[304:01.29]And I tried to.
[304:08.09]Was it room 4?
[304:08.77]Acute abdominal pain.
[304:20.66]Alright, same deal.
[304:21.82]Pain on both sides.
[304:27.96]Um, does anybody remember the game at the arcade?
[304:32.43]And this is a long time ago, so not very many of you guys are gonna know what I'm talking about.
[304:36.17]But there was a game that was crocodiles.
[304:38.35]And they'd be like, I'm gonna get you!
[304:40.49]And it was a game, it was a physical game, you had a mallet.
[304:43.49]And they would come out, they would go across, and it was like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[304:46.90]And you'd go, you'd have to hit them.
[304:49.52]And it made this exact noise.
[304:52.47]They would come over and it would be like... Right?
[305:03.46]That was one of my favorite games.
[305:09.23]It is the no- it is.
[305:10.83]Alright, so...
[305:13.97]pounding on their stomach.
[305:15.65]You know, when you make that noise, it's really funny.
[305:18.28]Your stomach hurts, but remember that game at the arcade?
[305:21.20]Alright, we're gonna do an x-ray.
[305:25.62]Nothing here.
[305:33.13]Um... Operate.
[305:36.13]Surgery.
[305:36.69]Operate.
[305:37.21]Initial.
[305:38.85]Operate.
[305:40.91]How do I operate?
[305:42.40]You're patient and ready for surgery.
[305:45.60]Don't just tell me where they are.
[305:47.42]Don't speak another language to me.
[305:50.10]Where does the surgery room?
[305:56.71]Oh, here we go.
[306:01.91]Oh, shit.
[306:02.83]Okay.
[306:04.07]Um, where are we?
[306:06.36]What is this?
[306:09.30]What do I do with, like, the hamster water bowl thing?
[306:11.62]Alright.
[306:12.96]I would suggest anesthesia before beginning surgery.
[306:15.78]Right, right, right, right.
[306:17.08]Soap?
[306:18.63]Okay, uh, where is it?
[306:20.57]Is this it?
[306:22.09]Where's the anesthesia?
[306:23.39]Gas.
[306:24.07]Turn it on.
[306:26.33]Okay, anesthesia's on.
[306:28.25]Um... Wouldn't you rather wash your hands before surgery?
[306:35.72]Where's the sink?
[306:39.37]What?
[306:40.35]You are rather unsterile.
[306:44.58]Where's the sink?
[306:46.52]Oh my God, you have scrubbed, doctor.
[306:50.12]Okay.
[306:51.82]I've never seen a surgeon operate with his bare hands before.
[306:57.91]Well, I've never seen somebody as good as me.
[307:00.81]Alright, let's go.
[307:02.89]We do this.
[307:29.95]Okay.
[307:30.35]45 patients complaining of flu-like symptoms.
[307:33.13]Nausea, generalizer.
[307:34.17]Get a minute.
[307:34.73]Let's go.
[307:38.89]Dr. Nalor called from the ER on line 2.
[307:42.59]What is it?
[307:45.82]Don't forget the staff meeting.
[307:47.32]Okay.
[307:54.42]Okay.
[307:55.28]Put the gas on.
[307:59.37]Wash hands.
[308:01.65]Put on the gloves.
[308:04.33]Okay, now what?
[308:07.50]What do we do now?
[308:09.00]Scalpel.
[308:10.22]Would you like to inject antibiotics first?
[308:12.92]Yes.
[308:15.92]Where's the antibiotic injector?
[308:24.18]The patient may become infected with antibiotics.
[308:28.86]Where's the antibiotics?
[308:33.04]I would like to inject antibiotics first.
[308:34.74]Yes, I would.
[308:40.03]This is the thing that they put in your mouth at the dentist.
[308:42.35]Like, the thing that sucks.
[308:47.34]Is this it?
[309:02.45]Well, this is- this changed!
[309:03.59]Which one's antibiotic?
[309:06.28]I don't know which one of these is antibiotic.
[309:10.54]Is it this one?
[309:11.56]A, G, B, S?
[309:14.37]Is there anything in this?
[309:37.01]What did I inject him with?
[309:39.04]What did I inject him with?
[309:42.46]Why?
[310:03.19]Give me a break.
[310:04.21]I wanted to forgive antibiotics.
[310:05.91]That's fucked up.
[310:07.03]Why?
[310:07.51]I wa- Why is that even there?
[310:22.18]A for antibiotic.
[310:27.63]Jesus use your mouse or mouse substitute to click on the patient's body you will then be presented with the patient's abdomen I know but why you're not teaching me anything okay instead of here's how you click on the door to leave the classroom maybe you should tell you doctors uh what syringe is adrenaline and what is an antibiotic
[311:00.23]Okay, let's do it.
[311:08.70]Okay.
[311:08.96]Is it everywhere?
[311:09.94]Okay, it's everywhere.
[311:12.26]Okay, it's the whole thing.
[311:14.30]So we're talking about... It's the whole stomach.
[311:27.19]Hmm.
[311:30.06]Maybe observe, maybe.
[311:39.58]Generalize weakness and not dizziness.
[311:42.15]I think we need an X right here.
[312:11.20]So this is, they're just really, really, really, this is the kind of scenario that you would do to somebody when you know they fucked up with the antibiotics before.
[312:27.85]This symptom indicates the presence of a bacterial infection, which should be treated with antibiotics.
[312:34.17]Right, Mike?
[312:35.56]And everyone looks at me and I'm just like, oh, fuck.
[312:40.48]Alright.
[312:43.70]No, what?
[312:44.76]He took the phone away from me.
[312:47.33]Give me the phone back.
[312:49.77]Give me the phone back.
[312:52.01]Now you left.
[312:52.85]Staff meeting.
[312:55.79]What's this?
[313:00.07]What?
[313:02.21]This is the... I can pick who I want on staff?
[313:06.27]Available... Print available... What did I just do?
[313:16.51]Okay, what do you mean?
[313:18.41]Flu-like symptoms.
[313:20.85]Abdominal pain is also present.
[313:25.97]Okay, hold on.
[313:26.51]We got... We have an acute pain here on the right side.
[313:30.29]Okay, acute pain on the right side.
[313:37.14]So that requires an x-ray.
[313:44.74]Is that something here?
[313:56.93]Okay.
[314:03.56]I think that's... I think we have to operate it.
[314:09.18]That's appendicitis?
[314:13.01]Okay.
[314:13.57]Appendicitis.
[314:16.51]See you in a minute.
[314:26.39]Wash hands.
[314:27.79]Put on the gloves.
[314:29.43]Okay, next draw.
[314:30.49]No, no, I want the other one, please.
[314:35.21]Okay.
[314:38.58]Be antibiotic.
[314:46.68]That's not the one.
[314:50.37]Turn on the gas.
[314:52.19]What just happened?
[314:55.02]What just happened?
[314:56.08]What?
[315:03.47]Kidney st- okay.
[315:08.23]Referrals.
[315:11.69]Right when I turned the gas on he was like testing me.
[315:19.19]They got everybody ready to go and got everybody in that room.
[315:23.10]For me to be like, okay, everyone in here?
[315:25.40]Everyone in their scrubs?
[315:27.12]Uh, yeah, let's go turn that... Don't get... Are you serious?
[315:30.78]You spent all that time?
[315:31.72]Why wouldn't you just tell me no?
[315:34.90]I thought I just said surgery's easy.
[315:36.12]I was like, what the fuck?
[315:43.97]Flu-like symptoms, nausea, weakness, dizziness, abdominal pain.
[315:46.63]Alright.
[315:51.16]Let's take a look.
[315:56.46]Both sides in pain.
[316:00.18]This is... Both sides in pain always means what?
[316:10.33]Ow.
[316:12.79]That means that we have a... We have to do a... An x-ray.
[316:28.36]I don't see the presence of any bacteria.
[316:34.24]Okay.
[316:39.31]Maybe an ultrasound.
[316:40.65]Pain and weakness on both sides.
[316:47.57]See you in the classroom.
[316:51.81]Operate.
[316:52.15]No, no, no, no, no.
[316:53.41]I'm going to say Medicaid.
[316:55.33]No.
[316:55.61]Cramping.
[316:56.17]Dizziness.
[316:58.29]Operate?
[316:58.83]I don't see anything, though.
[317:02.05]Ultrasound.
[317:06.27]I don't even know what that looks like.
[317:07.55]Let's operate.
[317:20.71]Dr. Chen called it.
[317:21.57]Number three.
[317:24.17]Don't forget our golf game next week.
[317:35.23]Alright.
[317:36.35]It's B for antibiotic.
[317:41.56]This is correct, right?
[317:42.44]It's not like D for like anti-diotic.
[317:45.08]It's not like L for like anti-liotic.
[317:47.80]It's B for antibiotic.
[317:53.22]I didn't wash my hands.
[317:54.44]Oh shit, I didn't.
[317:57.12]Doctor, you got your gloves on.
[318:06.38]Is this any... This is an antibiotic?
[318:22.87]Okay.
[318:24.47]Now... That's not an antibiotic.
[318:30.43]That's like a topical alcohol.
[318:39.05]It is.
[318:39.71]It's wrong.
[318:40.77]It's wrong.
[318:41.17]It's one of these syringes.
[318:42.33]I have to inject.
[318:50.72]Got it.
[318:51.48]You've injected antibiotics.
[318:52.52]Good.
[318:53.46]Okay, here we go.
[318:55.70]It is not proper procedure to leave this much of the patient's body uncovered if it is not part of the operation.
[319:00.36]Use the drape to cover the unaffected area.
[319:02.57]You've got it.
[319:07.75]Is this the drape?
[319:08.59]Which one of these is drape?
[319:09.49]This?
[319:11.45]Alright.
[319:12.97]Surgical site has been draped, Doctor.
[319:19.94]Here we go.
[319:38.57]I'm not skipping it, it's doing it automatically.
[319:46.45]What?
[319:48.01]What happened?
[319:56.26]What happened?
[319:58.02]What did I do wrong?
[320:10.96]Alright, we got, we got pain on the, we got pain on the left side.
[320:15.78]Let's go ahead and say you probably, maybe you got a kidney stone.
[320:19.38]You don't.
[320:23.11]But what does that mean?
[320:26.37]I don't know what to do from here.
[320:32.48]Operate?
[320:36.88]Appendicitis.
[320:38.10]Operate.
[320:44.30]Dr. Schwartz called from the gift shop.
[320:46.10]What do you mean from the gift shop?
[320:49.32]Your lab reports will be ready tomorrow.
[320:50.84]What do you mean lab reports?
[321:04.19]Okay.
[321:05.91]Antibiotics.
[321:09.71]Antibiotics administered.
[321:12.57]Is it because I put that shit all over it?
[321:20.85]Huh?
[321:23.17]Why?
[321:23.53]That's a very small area.
[321:28.30]Do I have to... What are we taking out?
[321:31.22]What are we taking out?
[321:33.62]It's a coin slot.
[321:37.10]Okay, hold on.
[321:37.72]The patient's skin is not sterile.
[321:39.02]Hold on.
[321:44.05]Okay.
[321:46.21]Are we ready to go in?
[321:52.96]Don't hack up the sterile drape.
[321:56.90]What are you talking about?
[322:08.77]Can somebody screen grab that?
[322:10.01]Because I'm not skipping it.
[322:11.99]It's skipping it automatically.
[322:12.83]I'm not touching anything.
[322:14.35]Can somebody freeze frame that and tell me what it said?
[322:26.12]Slow the game down.
[322:30.90]Okay.
[322:31.86]Who's calling me?
[322:36.96]Acute abdominal pain.
[322:42.62]He said there are procedures you have to follow before you're allowed to operate.
[322:48.43]Nausea, cramping, weakness, and dizziness.
[322:50.09]Alright, so here we go.
[322:54.95]Pain on the left side.
[322:58.31]Pain on both sides.
[323:03.51]Okay, so pain on both sides is... You check for kidney stones.
[323:13.60]And then you refer.
[323:19.27]Kidney stones on both sides.
[323:23.31]I don't... I'm not qualified for this.
[323:26.39]So this is a referral to a urologist.
[323:31.23]Very nicely done.
[323:32.32]Your diagnosis of kidney stones and your decision to refer to the patient were both correct.
[323:37.58]Thank you very much.
[323:40.76]Room 4.
[323:46.14]abdominal pain, weakness, nausea, and runny nose.
[323:50.18]You might just have the flu.
[323:58.02]Pain everywhere.
[324:00.41]Okay.
[324:02.59]So this is potential for medication.
[324:11.65]Nice job.
[324:13.17]Your recommendation to administer antibiotics for a case of bacterial infection is correct.
[324:17.36]Alright.
[324:25.24]Acute abdominal pain by nausea, cramping, generalized weakness, and dizziness.
[324:37.99]alright we got no pain no pain with um flu-like symptoms that is a hold on a minute here observation good job intestinal gas
[325:03.62]Acute abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, cramping, generalized weakness, and dizziness.
[325:07.01]Does anybody have anything else besides, like, stomach pain?
[325:20.43]Right side.
[325:24.57]Generalized pain in the right side.
[325:26.43]Nothing on the left side.
[325:29.43]Generalized pain on the right side.
[325:32.75]is we've got to do an x-ray.
[325:44.46]Not kidney stones.
[325:49.40]It's time to operate.
[325:56.56]Let's go.
[326:03.19]Line two.
[326:06.97]Hope you enjoy success today.
[326:10.57]Okay, thank you.
[326:11.53]Thank you, doctor, for your fortune cookie.
[326:14.47]Are you going to give me my lucky numbers, too?
[326:15.95]Alright, turn the gas on.
[326:29.38]Antibiotic.
[326:32.96]Good.
[326:34.65]Oops, I didn't put gloves on.
[326:39.89]Okay.
[326:41.41]Good.
[326:42.79]Now we are going to drape the area.
[326:48.03]Alright.
[326:49.71]Sterilize the skin.
[326:54.40]We are completely clean.
[326:56.66]Now what the fuck is going on here?
[327:02.51]What do I do now?
[327:08.51]Drag around the rectangle like this?
[327:11.02]I just go like this, right?
[327:19.14]Not the knife.
[327:19.96]Not the knife.
[327:21.68]Without the knife.
[327:28.40]The drape is on wrong.
[327:33.41]Oh, jeez.
[327:37.74]What does it want me to do?
[327:38.56]How am I... I don't know where it wants me to go.
[327:50.34]But what does it want me to go?
[327:54.89]Choose the spot to cut, then cut.
[327:56.39]That's what I'm doing.
[328:00.25]You put the drape where you want it.
[328:01.45]I mean, don't I want it like here?
[328:02.53]Here?
[328:04.86]I can only go... Look, let's say I start up here.

[328:39.69]Ah!

[328:43.36]Like, look.
[328:44.70]It doesn't matter.
[328:45.32]I can't, like, bring this over here.
[328:47.54]It's only this.
[328:52.28]This square is only... I can make it only bigger and smaller in the middle.

[330:44.47]But which tool do I use is the thing?
[330:47.03]Am I going to clamp something?
[330:50.11]They didn't teach me how to do surgery.
[330:52.13]They just said go do surgery.
[331:00.67]Hook up the blood.
[331:05.61]What the hell was that?
[331:06.93]Okay, that's what that does.
[331:11.55]What does this one do?
[331:19.58]That's the problem.
[331:24.44]Okay, this is the issue.
[331:26.17]It's got to be sticking out and then cut.
[331:37.17]I just want to see what they do.
[331:39.00]I just want to see what they do.
[331:40.58]I just want to see.
[331:41.02]Wait, did he just tell me for the first time ever how to fucking do surgery?
[331:45.06]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[331:45.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[331:50.59]Every single time he didn't tell me shit, and then now he does.
[331:54.37]Okay, alright.
[331:54.91]Let me just... Hold on.
[331:56.11]None of these people are dying.
[332:09.33]They're fine.
[332:31.40]I got it under control.
[332:33.18]So we need to do scissors?
[332:34.96]No, we need to do the forceps.
[332:38.33]Stick these in here.
[332:39.91]And then the knife.
[332:42.01]Right?
[332:48.31]Use the sponge.
[332:53.14]No, the scissors.
[332:54.12]What do you mean?
[332:56.56]Use the scissors.
[332:57.14]I just did these last time and I got yelled at.
[333:02.64]You need to hook up to your blood.
[333:04.42]There is no blood to hook up.
[333:10.24]It's the scalpel.
[333:15.11]It's- I have to quit.
[333:17.17]I can't fucking do anything.
[333:27.37]The blood is the red bottle in the- Alright, but what is he saying right there?
[333:40.83]I can't read it because it skips it automatically.
[333:42.51]I can't stop it.
[333:46.33]That's not the proper procedure.
[333:51.88]Will you tell me what I did wrong?
[333:54.08]Yes, there's a phone call.
[333:55.16]Okay, hold on.
[333:56.40]I know.
[333:56.96]Right, right.
[333:57.58]Okay.
[333:59.09]I know.
[333:59.49]Why does it tell me how to do an examination but it doesn't tell me how to do surgery?
[334:10.68]And they don't have class.
[334:19.85]You don't have to do surgery.
[334:27.93]Look it up.
[334:29.99]Alright, I'm going to do one more and try to get it right.
[334:32.62]But I don't understand the surgery part.
[334:37.78]Who's left?
[334:41.68]Abdominal pain with flu-like symptoms.
[334:44.54]Let's take a look.
[334:48.24]We're just going to observe you, because everything looks like it's fine.
[334:52.79]Congratulations, the patient suffered from intestinal gas.
[334:54.77]You did it.
[335:00.71]Alright, somebody just... Flu-like symptoms, nausea, generalized weakness, and dizziness.
[335:09.42]Alright, pain on the left and right sides.
[335:13.93]And that means we look for kidney stones.
[335:17.51]Don't have kidney stones.
[335:19.97]Okay.
[335:22.51]So now, it's time.
[335:31.61]It's time to operate.
[335:34.40]Ultraspin.
[335:39.10]Nobody even knows what that is.
[335:40.14]It's been the same image every single time.
[335:55.88]Thanks for calling back.
[335:56.58]Be careful out there.
[335:57.56]Okay.
[335:59.06]Alright, I'm going to try this one more time.
[336:04.07]I can't use any of the dials, no.
[336:10.71]And now, let's do antibiotic.
[336:17.11]Drape.
[336:19.38]Here, I guess.
[336:20.60]Yes.
[336:25.13]The patient's skin is not sterile.
[336:26.57]Okay.
[336:35.46]Okay.
[336:36.63]Now, what do you want me to do?
[336:38.83]Get the IV bag?
[336:52.33]Drag the blood shit to the plastic bottle thing.
[336:57.25]Left of the text box.
[337:05.88]Are you fucking kidding me?
[337:09.86]So this blood- the blood IV is in place now, Doctor.
[337:17.16]Do we have to connect it?
[337:18.76]Is it already in?
[337:19.86]Is it ready?
[337:20.32]Are we ready to go?
[337:24.01]Now I can cut.
[337:29.51]Cut now.
[337:31.34]Cut now?
[337:33.34]No, wait.
[337:34.08]Let me cut.
[337:34.64]It is sterilized.
[337:37.74]Cut vertically.
[337:40.06]Cut vertically.
[337:41.46]I'm gonna do it.
[337:42.52]Cut vertically.
[337:46.46]I got fired again.
[337:54.31]Wildly!
[338:03.64]Cut a nice circle!
[338:04.70]No!
[338:06.86]No!
[338:07.18]I wanna see what it does!
[338:59.62]Alright, now what- Use saline instead of blood.
[339:07.60]Is it- do I need to do saline?
[339:12.89]Connect the IV tube.
[339:17.85]Oh, that's the EK- that's the EKG?
[339:21.27]What did I just do?
[339:22.87]What is this thing doing?
[339:23.61]What is this?
[339:26.72]Oh, those are stitches.
[339:30.40]What is this?
[339:30.82]I don't know what that does.
[339:33.03]I don't know what that is.
[339:36.55]It's just an X. X marks the spot.
[339:54.08]This doesn't do anything though.
[340:00.54]Alright, this is my last try.
[340:10.81]I can't even... I can't even cut.
[340:16.32]Why can I not cut?
[340:30.14]I can't cut him.
[340:34.54]I can't even... Why can I not do this?
[340:45.01]I can't even pull these out.
[340:46.83]Doctor, really doctor, must you handle the patient in such a fashion?
[340:52.51]Blood's going down quick.
[340:53.47]It's alright, I can refill it.
[341:33.40]You should probably attend to the patient's weakening heartbeat.
[341:35.68]Check the EKG.
[341:43.12]Check the EKG.
[341:44.20]Alright, what?
[341:54.71]I can't do it.
[341:55.65]I'm out.
[341:59.93]Medical school.
[342:03.47]Hold on.
[342:07.91]Oh my god.
[342:12.94]Hello?
[342:18.70]What was that?
[342:19.26]Alright, I'm moving on.
[342:29.34]I can't do this one anymore.
[342:32.30]I can't.
[342:35.33]It's too much.
[342:39.11]I really wanted to do a surgery, but I couldn't.
[342:43.09]There's a sequel to this game that involves... Wait, there's a sequel?
[342:50.41]Should I do the sequel?
[343:01.00]Yes, no, no, no, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes.
[343:05.37]What is it called?
[343:10.52]What is it called?
[343:16.66]It's not Kingdom Hearts 2.
[343:17.86]Life and Death 2?
[343:22.46]I'm kind of invested.
[343:23.20]I need to know.
[343:31.92]Same name, too.
[343:36.80]okay it is a game life and death to the brain okay let's try it so okay was life and death one the stomach and life and death to the brain
[344:11.27]Dr. Tom.
[344:21.59]Jack.
[344:25.25]Dr. Jack, please report to the classroom.
[344:26.83]Right.
[344:26.99]How do you arrange with Dr. Griffin in the classroom this afternoon?
[344:35.38]Yeah, just the sight of Nora sending Heidi back in here in an eating bench.
[344:40.25]This is not the classroom?
[344:45.76]Oh.
[344:49.28]Thought it said Southeast.
[344:50.04]You should always perform a full physical examination of the patient before specifying a treatment so that you have all the information and avoid a misdiagnosis.
[344:58.18]yeah uh brain infarction is growing a blood vessel supplying the brain become blocked opened by blood clots the symptoms are very similar to those of brain tumors okay weakness and loss of sensation the clear inside of the body upset infraction pupil dilation light reaction and eye movement are also affected on that side okay speech impairment and it's buried to the left side best way to identify uh infraction the cat it's it's not it's an infarction or an MRI scan
[345:28.69]the angiogram may show the occlusion while cat and MRI will reveal the area.
[345:35.99]The only effective treatment for infarction is physical therapy, which may restore much of the patient's abilities lost through the death of brain cell.

[347:42.31]Reflex absent on the... I can't check that box?
[347:49.33]What is going on?
[347:50.41]No, no, no, no.
[347:50.99]I want to get back.
[347:51.63]Get me out of here.
[347:55.11]I'm going to go back.
[347:55.69]Let's go back to this page.
[347:56.49]Okay.
[347:56.71]Say Alice.
[347:58.31]Okay, do you feel this?
[348:06.27]That's in the face, right?
[348:17.99]You can do that?
[348:25.59]Get the class.
[348:28.23]Please don't stick the pin in the patient's eyes.
[348:29.76]Imagine going to class at a medical school and they say, please don't stick the pin in the patient's eyes.
[348:51.03]Really?
[348:51.41]I didn't know.
[348:57.23]Alice?
[348:58.35]Alice?
[349:00.78]Oog!
[349:01.60]Oog!
[349:02.90]No, what is this?
[349:03.60]Is this like a cigarette?
[349:06.32]What is this?
[349:10.29]No, you shine a light in their eyes, right?
[349:12.53]I think so.
[349:26.05]Those are dilated.
[349:27.45]Come back over here.
[349:30.83]What do I do with this?
[349:33.01]Oh my, what the fuck?
[349:43.22]What is going on?
[349:57.12]How do I... Left, right, up, down.
[350:07.72]Okay.
[350:08.64]Let's take a look at the sheet.
[350:10.84]Face.
[350:11.80]Abnormal dilation.
[350:13.68]No light reaction.
[350:15.19]Left and right, both.
[350:15.99]Okay.
[350:18.09]Arms.
[350:18.55]Let's go back to the arms.
[350:24.47]No.
[350:26.70]Okay.
[350:31.28]Got reflexes on both.
[350:33.66]You got feeling on both.
[350:35.56]Okay.
[350:36.96]Let's note that.
[350:39.96]Okay.
[350:43.11]And then we're going down here.
[350:50.51]Okay.
[351:00.96]Okay.
[351:04.52]So that looks like we've got pretty good.
[351:09.24]We've got abnormal dilation in the eyes and no reaction to light.
[351:14.93]Huh.
[351:15.83]Interesting.
[351:18.51]Patient's 57-year-old man who came to the hospital said he was conscious.
[351:20.81]According to friends, he was non-responsive to their presence, allergic to crab and other shellfish.
[351:27.61]OK, so no dilation in the eyes.
[351:31.46]Next time for a potential MRI.
[351:49.81]Is that normal?
[351:51.01]Does that look normal?
[351:57.67]That's a brain.
[351:58.45]Alright.
[352:06.71]So should I. Code red in the cat scanner.
[352:24.81]What?
[352:27.73]I thought they were eating him for a second.
[352:29.79]I was like, this is fucked.
[352:31.75]I thought they were eating his body.
[352:34.67]Oh my god, they're cannibalizing the guy.
[352:36.63]What happened?
[352:38.64]This is still fucked up.
[352:46.38]What?
[352:47.46]What?
[352:55.05]Your patient died in the CAT scanner due to an allergic reaction to the contrast dye.
[353:00.54]I didn't know that.
[353:08.27]Patient's history.
[353:10.59]Oh.
[353:12.34]Some patients are allergic to iodine, which is used to contrast.
[353:15.24]I have the CAT scanner.
[353:17.25]You should not order CAT scans for such patients.
[353:19.11]Use the MRI.
[353:19.99]Allergic reactions to shellfish and those seafood is a good indicator that the patient has an allergy.
[353:26.15]Okay.
[353:28.08]Patient in room four.
[353:36.50]That's not good.
[353:45.88]What's that on the right eye?
[353:47.24]What's in the right eye?
[353:51.85]Is that normal?
[353:56.99]Okay, you're reacting to light.

[378:26.34]Attack.
[378:30.26]Germicast, Scary Sight.
[378:34.20]Four points of damage.
[378:36.93]A Gordrilla slices a Greenbolt and hits for six points of damage.
[378:41.99]Greenbolt gets stabbed again and gets hit for seven points.
[378:47.33]One of the Gordrillas is dead from Iron Pants.
[378:52.30]A gourd ruler summons help and none appears.

[380:03.95]Okay, Green Bolt slashes at Gorge Ruler, hits for 4 damage.
[380:11.48]Why would you attack your own party?
[380:13.42]Why is that even possible?
[380:14.52]I thought that meant like we attack together.
[380:17.60]As one move or something.
[380:21.56]Attack foes.
[380:23.90]Attack foes.
[380:26.04]We can't even beat the sludge enemies.

[380:55.25]No, and hitting it.
[381:02.76]Oh, it's dead.
[381:04.86]Each character receives 525 experience points for valor and battle knowledge and 105 gold.
[381:11.02]That's pretty awesome, actually.
[381:12.40]Let's keep going.
[381:26.63]Just walk west?
[381:28.41]Do I have a map?
[381:39.34]Oh, what's this?
[381:43.96]What is that?
[381:48.15]Is it a wall?
[381:50.67]Is there anything in this?
[381:51.89]Is there a door?
[381:59.32]There's something else over here too.
[382:01.24]What is that?
[382:04.22]Minerals?
[382:08.21]It's a camp, but... Hold on, it's blocked by the trees.
[382:19.41]I can't get in there?
[382:23.14]Oh shit, it's the circus.
[382:25.30]Ooh!
[382:30.90]Really?
[382:31.58]I just want to go over there.
[382:33.10]Oh my god, I have to maneuver around the fucking trees.
[382:40.73]Go in there.
[382:41.40]I want to get over here.
[383:00.31]Straight right.
[383:10.23]Puma?
[383:15.63]Did we just get attacked?
[383:18.38]One Puma, will you... Um... One Puma, 20 health?
[383:27.68]I think we can kill it.
[383:33.23]Everybody's attack at the same time.
[383:35.61]Kill it.
[383:39.53]I missed the Puma.
[383:41.69]Gwendolyn misses the Puma.
[383:43.23]The Puma advances.
[383:45.19]Iron Pants actually hits the damn thing.
[383:47.79]And so does Green Bolt.
[383:52.67]It's gonna come and tear my throat out, isn't it?
[383:59.01]You still face one Puma.
[384:00.65]It's got 10 health.
[384:01.75]Fight.
[384:03.29]Attack.
[384:07.32]Go on.
[384:12.48]Puma Claws a Green Bolt, hits it for 11 damage.
[384:17.90]Green Bolt.
[384:18.36]Okay, killing it.
[384:19.08]Nice, it's dead.
[384:23.59]It's dead.
[384:26.45]Anybody treasure?
[384:27.01]50 gold, 250 EXP.
[384:33.53]Nice.
[384:35.63]Alright, now let me in here.
[384:38.20]It shouldn't be this difficult to get in here.
[384:40.87]You've done such a great job keeping people out.
[384:43.75]Oh my god, finally.
[384:47.49]Scrapwood Tavern.
[384:56.08]Buy some stuff?
[384:56.54]I have money.
[384:59.28]Hail, travelers!
[385:00.10]Step to the bar and I'll draw you a tankard.
[385:02.72]You can order a drink or talk to the barkeep.
[385:04.50]Let's get some drinks.
[385:08.13]Who will order a drink?
[385:12.76]All of us?
[385:17.16]What'll it be, Germo?
[385:20.10]I'll have Foul Spirits.
[385:25.26]Will you have it for here or to go?
[385:27.44]I'll have it here.
[385:29.06]Oh, that's good stuff.
[385:41.04]That's because you begin to sing 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
[385:55.72]You collapse on the floor.
[386:05.79]Thou are in no condition to order anything.
[386:07.87]We'll just give you a ginger ale then.
[386:11.65]Alright, let's talk to the barkeep.
[386:14.35]Who will talk to the barkeep?
[386:17.86]Me.
[386:21.12]Okay, then Gwendolyn.
[386:31.00]Talk ain't cheap, the barkeep says.
[386:32.56]How much will you tip him?
[386:36.34]How much money do I have?
[386:39.30]You're trying to tell me that 500 gold is not enough money?
[386:48.76]I think that's all the money I have.
[386:50.40]500?
[386:50.42]I don't have 500.
[386:53.28]100?
[386:53.30]Ooh.
[387:09.96]Be on the lookout for the magic gems.
[387:11.54]Your spellcasters will need them.
[387:16.35]No shit.
[387:18.27]Alright, get out of here.
[387:25.75]Was that another building?
[387:26.67]There's a camp over here.
[387:30.14]Let's just go.
[387:33.06]I want to go north.
[387:34.82]I want to go northwest.
[387:43.60]Jerma, is the carnival stream going to be on Mixer?
[387:47.16]It is not going to be on Mixer.
[387:51.53]Enjoy your next life, you snarl, you see.
[387:53.85]Okay.
[388:04.40]Attack, attack, attack, attack.
[388:09.94]Three hookbang swings at Iron Pants.
[388:12.12]Four points of damage.
[388:15.78]How much health do they have?
[388:20.74]Not very much.
[388:21.22]One's dead.
[388:21.56]Are they all dead?
[388:26.32]This green goblin.
[388:33.51]Here, halfway up Earthdagger Mountain, winds swirl around and make this place earn its name.
[388:38.83]Cold Peak.
[388:42.43]Okay.
[388:42.55]Okay.
[388:48.73]What's this?
[388:57.62]A dark gnome.
[388:58.64]Okay.
[389:01.43]This is not a bad game.
[389:02.21]This is actually kind of fun.
[389:04.11]Your battle cry is heard by all as you face one dark gnome.
[389:07.75]Will your gallant band... I don't want to fight.
[389:09.37]Let's go.
[389:15.15]I want to go in this building, but it's like tank controls.
[389:24.92]Welcome, oh weary ones, to our humble temple.
[389:27.32]Dost thou wish to heal a character?
[389:29.04]Pull thy gold.
[389:31.12]Pull the gold together.
[389:33.18]Whom shall I gather thy gold?
[389:38.28]Gwendolyn now hath all the gold.
[389:40.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[389:40.78]I want all the gold.
[389:42.67]Pull the gold.
[389:45.03]to me.
[389:47.15]Thank you.
[389:50.67]And heal me.
[389:56.13]Jerma has wounds which need tending.
[389:57.67]The donation will be 80 in gold.
[389:59.37]Who will forfeit the gold?
[390:00.61]I will.
[390:03.94]There we go.
[390:04.68]He is healed.
[390:06.36]Goodbye.
[390:06.86]Nice to see you.
[390:12.06]So I want to go back to
[390:15.48]North.

[390:23.21]Oh, we're just here.
[390:24.15]That's Scrapwood Tavern.
[390:25.29]Wait!
[390:30.88]I can add people to the party, right?

[391:33.11]A hedge lizard.
[391:39.67]Two hedge lizards.
[391:41.13]Fight.
[391:43.89]Attack.
[391:49.19]Shadow can hide in the shadows.
[391:53.01]That's, I guess, the namesake.
[391:56.20]Shadow jumps into the shadows but is discovered.
[391:59.26]Missed the lizard.
[392:01.64]Green Bolt swings.
[392:03.26]Iron Pant swings.
[392:04.00]Kills it.
[392:06.92]They got it.
[392:07.30]We're good.
[392:10.37]So what do you think?
[392:10.91]Ran behind a tree?
[392:11.85]And they were like, hey, we saw you run behind a tree, man.
[392:14.69]Oh, shit.
[392:24.84]Okay, trees on every side.
[392:30.63]North and west only.
[392:42.39]He just tucked his head into his shirt.
[392:45.09]Sounds like it, actually.
[392:50.77]Just run.
[392:53.56]No, no, no.
[392:54.04]Run.
[392:54.54]I want to run.
[392:55.08]Alright, we'll just kill them then.
[393:06.20]I just got stabbed for nine damage.
[393:08.56]I'm almost dead again.
[393:13.66]I have four HP left.
[393:17.88]What the fuck?
[393:18.66]Can they just die already, please?
[393:26.62]Just kill your party members to be ha-ha funny.
[393:33.50]I'm not going to need to because I'm probably just going to die.
[393:35.50]I'm going to get stabbed right now.
[393:42.84]No, we're good.
[393:44.61]Miss.
[393:45.43]Miss.
[393:46.25]Good.
[393:46.65]Kill it.
[393:54.43]That would be such a funny moment.
[393:57.34]Uh-oh.
[393:58.80]Back to back.
[393:59.34]If I die, I'm done.
[394:00.58]End of the game.
[394:08.19]Run.
[394:13.84]A serpent.
[394:15.22]Why am I getting just back to back to... That's terrifying.
[394:21.36]I might have some money though.
[394:23.20]There's only one.
[394:27.35]Everybody attack it.
[394:35.67]Swing and a miss.
[394:38.24]Green Bolt bit.
[394:39.72]Green Bolt's not doing too well either.
[394:43.22]Okay, it's almost dead.
[394:43.92]It's still alive.
[394:49.52]It's got the best teeth.
[394:53.61]Let me see.
[394:54.37]Wow, those are nice.
[394:57.29]Those are some piano keys, man.
[394:59.83]Alright, attack.
[395:00.39]Everybody attack.
[395:09.19]Green Bolt is now on the verge of death.
[395:15.47]Can somebody kill this?
[395:18.39]Thank god.
[395:31.82]I'm not really entirely sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but... I mean, there is... a place to go over here.
[395:42.03]What's the point of in here?
[395:46.63]Oh shit, I'm supposed to go here.
[395:52.39]There's an unnatural silence as if death itself has come to stay.
[396:05.40]Go in this door?
[396:11.36]The party is inside a storage building.
[396:13.12]Who wishes to inspect?
[396:19.67]Would Jerma like to pick up harmonic gem, plate armor, halberd?
[396:24.03]Okay, give me the halberd.
[396:31.96]Give me everything.
[396:34.38]The gem.
[396:38.78]Where's take all?
[396:43.72]Plate Armor.
[396:51.15]All full.
[396:52.69]Okay, now it's Iron Pants' turn.
[397:02.22]Lamp.
[397:03.24]Firehorn.
[397:04.58]Soothing Balm.
[397:05.66]Youth Potion.
[397:06.50]Alright, Gwendolyn, just grab the Youth Potion and we can get out of here.
[397:12.73]Empty.
[397:14.37]Cleaned it out.
[397:18.37]I have to hit, I don't want you guys to see the final thing I'm gonna do though, so I have to go like this.
[397:27.67]You'll see the tab that's open.
[397:31.90]Did I get it all?
[397:39.10]Do each one of these doors, can I go in?
[397:42.32]That's it, file stalkers.
[397:46.53]I think we have to fight them.
[397:49.73]Everybody attack.
[397:50.61]Wait, use an item.
[397:55.83]Broad sword?
[397:57.19]You can't use that item.
[397:59.97]Use an item.
[398:05.10]What can I do?
[398:07.44]I can put the plate armor on.
[398:15.68]Maybe not.
[398:17.18]Maybe I have to go into the menu later?
[398:18.67]Okay.
[398:34.57]Miss.
[398:36.72]16 points of damage to Gwendolyn.
[398:39.90]A Foul Star, but it swings to Dremel and hits for 9.
[398:41.64]I'm dead.
[398:42.10]I'm dead.
[398:45.04]It's Iron Pants for 15.
[398:46.24]These are really, really... Iron Pants drinks and feels less thirsty.
[398:53.71]Good.
[398:58.76]What is that Mario emote?
[398:59.86]That Mario falling down emote?
[399:04.20]Why do I feel like that emote is huge?
[399:21.65]Okay.
[399:25.93]Alright, I'm dumping the healing, the youth potion on me.
[399:34.19]Gwendolyn casts a spell, youth.
[399:38.39]Everyone, we're all dead.
[399:44.16]We're not getting out of this, it's over.
[399:49.66]Yeah, I gotta get a good Super Mario emote, don't you think?
[399:52.82]Alright, I give up.
[400:17.48]I should do Cake Mario?
[400:18.66]I would do a Cake Mario emote, but then we wouldn't understand what it was.
[400:28.07]Which item?
[400:28.69]Mandolin?
[400:29.25]No, no, no, no.
[400:37.17]Can they do it?
[400:38.51]No, Mandolin's dead.
[400:41.97]Who's left?
[400:42.43]Shadow.
[400:44.35]Oh, he's in the shadows right now, isn't he?
[400:52.80]Let's see if I can get away.
[400:55.38]Can I sneak away into the shadows?
[401:00.14]Alright, you can live out the rest of your days in this building, Shadow.
[401:06.37]Quick, run!
[401:12.83]Uh oh.
[401:16.41]Here comes the bad ending.
[401:24.49]No, no, no, I want to run.
[401:25.77]Hide in the shadows.
[401:27.95]I'm dead.
[401:38.28]What happened?
[401:40.18]Did one run away?
[401:41.02]I have no idea what just happened.
[401:48.97]Get me out of this place!
[401:52.97]Get me out of this place!
[401:55.93]Channeling like Tommy Wiseau right now.
[401:57.75]Alright, can I just, like, drink poison?
[402:02.90]Just drink poison.
[402:14.47]Uhhh, what's going on?
[402:18.37]Shadow is a level 2 male hobbit rogue.
[402:21.35]Oh, that's me.
[402:27.11]Even in death, I get all the fucking money.
[402:28.81]Alright, I'm done.
[402:46.56]That's a pretty fun game, if you were to sit down and actually play it 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[402:57.83]Uh, and the final thing that I wanted to do... You didn't drink the poison?
[403:05.44]Well, then he can stay alive.
[403:11.18]He gets to live.
[403:17.27]No, it's not gonna be a porn game.
[403:31.18]Ladies and gentlemen.
[403:38.00]It's original.
[403:42.18]Donkey Kong, right?
[403:54.89]Wake up!
[403:55.41]It's time to go to work!
[403:57.42]Time to go to school!
[404:01.60]Not the alarm!
[404:04.11]Alright, get it off.
[404:07.15]I can't get it off.
[404:07.83]I don't know what's going on.
[404:12.21]Hit the snooze button quick!
[404:14.65]Alright, I can't hear that anymore.
[404:32.54]Alright, I fixed it.
[404:33.84]It's still a lot worse.
[404:34.97]Alright.
[404:35.41]That's it.
[404:58.96]I feel like if I listen to this long enough, I'll go insane.
[405:00.92]This is like, you'll go insane if you listen to this.
[405:03.04]Should we try it?
[405:04.80]I'm gonna put both headphones in.
[405:05.96]Turn your volume down.
[405:06.64]I'm gonna see if I go insane.
[405:12.94]Turn your volume down.
[405:17.26]Oh fuck, come on.
[405:21.26]Alright, both headphones are in.
[405:27.11]Turn your volume down.
[405:41.72]Never mind.
[405:46.58]I've gone insane.
[405:47.36]Alright, that's it.
[405:52.45]I got hit by the fucking thing.
[405:57.39]Yeah, I'm spent.
[406:01.23]I was only supposed to stream for, like, four or five hours tonight.
[406:03.61]Because I have some stuff to do, but then I get too sucked into the surgery game.
[406:07.59]So, going for more than seven hours tonight!
[406:11.07]Uh, I'll see you guys tomorrow, though.
[406:16.96]We'll be doing Terraria with Star.
[406:22.38]Picking up where we left off last week.
[406:28.02]Is the stream gonna be early?
[406:29.04]I really don't know.
[406:30.08]I don't know, I gotta talk to Star.
[406:33.29]So the sus is just going to be tentative.
[406:38.03]So it might be earlier than 3 or 4 Pacific.
[406:40.96]But we'll see.
[406:44.50]We cheated out of our Duke Nugum.
[406:48.94]We will do this again though.
[406:50.98]I have a lot of fun playing these.
[406:53.58]It's always a rollercoaster.
[406:54.56]I love it.
[406:58.80]But let us conclude.
[407:03.67]Let's do the bits.
[407:05.25]Go back earlier, about seven hours ago.
[407:10.09]Close this window.
[407:13.03]Move this over here.
[407:18.23]And if you're taking off, maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[407:19.85]If not, then we'll see you probably next week.
[407:28.88]So.
[407:32.34]Back earlier, we had Lazy Luke.
[407:33.92]Thanks, Lazy Luke, for the $2.50.
[407:37.40]$2.50.
[407:39.78]Hey, Jerma, you asked when the last time was that you used jermaMoon.
[407:44.32]It was March 2nd, 2019.
[407:47.33]Exactly five months ago.
[407:55.27]Here is a part in the VOD where you talk about how much you love that god-awful emote.
[408:01.11]God-awful emote.
[408:10.32]Have I really not used jermaMoon for five months?
[408:14.38]No, what am I doing?
[408:20.87]It was in VR!
[408:24.21]jermaMoon is my first emote ever, and it's like... I was intentionally trying to have an emote that was awful.
[408:33.07]I love it though, that's my favorite emote.
[408:36.87]This is by far my favorite emote on the site.
[408:40.40]And I didn't do it for five months.
[408:43.94]I don't think anybody has one that can compare.
[408:46.20]I don't think they do.
[408:48.46]I'll stand on the egomaniac hill here.
[408:50.90]I love that emote.
[408:52.22]That's the best emote on Twitch.
[408:53.55]God, what a beautiful emote.
[408:54.81]I agree.
[408:55.31]It's so good.
[408:57.07]I say that because it's my face.
[408:58.69]It's me.
[409:03.03]I hope you guys don't take me that seriously.
[409:05.16]You definitely don't.
[409:05.73]Take me that seriously.
[409:06.76]I'm not kidding.
[409:07.36]That is the best emote on Twitch.
[409:16.90]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[409:21.21]Thank you, Chimera87x for the 250.
[409:25.37]Rick Vitality is Alec Jones' next supplement line.
[409:33.24]Rick Vitality.
[409:38.75]That guy was wild.
[409:47.70]Thank you to StiffFunkyChicken for the three bucks.
[409:52.42]Uh, I asked last night you this, but I think you missed it.
[409:55.17]If not, disregard.
[409:56.71]I was wondering if you had thought about establishing a place for members to submit community art.
[410:02.36]Yeah, uh, I'm not sure how much you've been around the last week or so, but I'm going to start to do community nights.
[410:11.29]Where instead of it just being, we're gonna do artwork, we're gonna do, show a couple of, a video that somebody sent through.
[410:17.01]We're gonna do, uh, a, somebody sent like a funny coffee pasta.
[410:24.10]once every two or three weeks we're gonna just compile all of them and spend an hour or two at least going through so it'll be like artwork videos uh random like little stories that people write so and that's why I've not been uh I've been I don't really have a time frame for that unfortunately because this carnival stream has taken up all of my other non-on-stream time
[410:54.96]When I'm not live on Twitch, besides like taking a day or two here just to kind of, you know, hang out with my girlfriend and be like a person, I've been doing this carnival shit.
[411:09.19]So I haven't put that much brainpower into this yet.
[411:12.33]And it really is probably not going to start happening until the carnival stream is over.
[411:21.78]So all time that is dedicated to, like, stream stuff is split at this point evenly with the carnival and being, like, actually on stream.
[411:35.18]But after the 21st, I'm really going to get that hammered out and have an actual set time for whenever we're going to do it.
[411:44.41]I might even be able to do it.
[411:45.11]It depends on how much work gets done this coming week.
[411:50.74]Next week is when most of the real important details for this stream are going to happen.
[411:55.14]Because it's already been back and forth about contracts and what do we want?
[412:00.39]How many robots do you want?
[412:01.73]How many things do you want to do?
[412:02.93]Do you want to have this?
[412:03.51]Do you want to have that?
[412:04.15]And this next week here is we're all going to be in the same room and really hash the whole thing out.
[412:10.08]So we might be able to do it sooner than that.
[412:11.96]We'll see.
[412:16.98]But it is coming.
[412:18.38]It will be here.
[412:20.51]Hey, real sleazy, thanks for the five dollars.
[412:23.01]Get serious or start flying lessons.
[412:33.24]Hey, hash house a go-go, the whole thing.
[412:35.80]Oh, don't say that.
[412:37.88]That makes me want to have the blue cheese stuffed cheeseburger.
[412:41.83]This is the best fucking hamburger I've ever had.
[412:46.71]I want it right now.
[412:49.76]I'm just gonna go get it.
[412:55.86]If you're, by the way, if you are around, if you're in town here for EVO, go get a cheeseburger from Hash House at GoGo.
[413:05.08]At the link.
[413:06.30]Do yourself a major favor.
[413:18.98]That's a shill.
[413:19.66]I will... Go ahead and call me that.
[413:22.74]Bite into that burger and then you'll start telling everybody to do the same thing.
[413:29.32]As someone who lives in Vegas, I can vouch for this.
[413:31.36]Thank you.
[413:35.05]That place is 24 hours and has some of the best, just delicious food you can get all night.
[413:40.99]Every day.
[413:43.27]God, I fucking love that place.
[413:44.41]I really do.
[413:50.15]Did they deliver across the country?
[413:51.77]I don't think so.
[413:54.45]Hey, thank you, Zake, for the $2.50.
[413:55.87]How much money do I have to give, man?
[413:57.55]Can I get my dog back?
[413:59.25]I don't have your dog.
[414:08.83]How juicy are the burgers?
[414:12.97]It's... I can't even describe it.
[414:14.93]It's like the crunchy, crispy edges.
[414:17.91]It's really smashed up, stacked, juicy in the middle, crispy on the outside.
[414:22.99]I have to go get one.
[414:25.06]It's two patties.
[414:35.36]There are four hash houses in Vegas.
[414:36.84]Go to the one at the link.
[414:41.37]Is the Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas?
[414:43.01]Yeah, Gordon Ramsay has like four restaurants here.
[414:48.28]He certainly loves Las Vegas.
[414:51.12]He's got four fucking restaurants.
[415:00.57]And they're all great.
[415:01.35]Yeah, they are.
[415:04.49]I actually have not had the burger from the Gordon Ramsay burger place.
[415:08.86]Because every single time we have ever gone to try to get one, there's a line out the door.
[415:16.66]You need to be ready to wait in a PAX line to go see the 12 minutes of Legend of Zelda 6 footage.
[415:26.29]You know what I'm saying?
[415:27.07]For like three hours.
[415:34.53]It is an actual Disney World line.
[415:44.57]Book a seat in advance?
[415:45.49]I'm not sure they do that.
[415:48.58]A lot of restaurants in Vegas don't, like, do reservations.
[415:53.71]You just kind of have to show the fuck up.
[415:57.03]We went somewhere, uh, last week.
[416:01.01]Or, yeah, we went somewhere that you can't, you physically can't, they don't do reservations.
[416:15.22]How much have you gambled since you moved to Vegas?
[416:17.38]Maybe one to two hundred thousand dollars.
[416:24.41]Not a whole lot.
[416:33.61]Oh, but I forgot to mention, I put one dollar at a machine when we first got here and hit a million dollars.
[416:40.23]So, I mean, that's not that much in the grand picture.
[416:44.20]I still got eight hundred thousand.
[416:47.72]Oh, that'd be fucking awesome.
[416:51.30]Is that for- That is not for real.
[416:54.00]No, that did not fucking happen.
[416:57.57]I would be on the goddamn news if that happened.
[417:08.79]If I put a dollar into a machine and it won a million, I would be holding a check, smiling like a... I'd be on all the fucking news stations.
[417:17.92]No.
[417:33.52]Unfortunately, I did not win a jackpot.
[417:39.01]I wouldn't be able to hold that information in.
[417:42.29]If you would have hit a fucking million dollars on like a scratch ticket or a slot machine or some weird table game, you'd think I'd be able to keep my mouth shut.
[417:53.12]Every day would just be like, million, million, a million, you want a million dollars, you want a million, you have a million, you have a million dollars.
[417:58.28]It'd be like, hey guys, so today, tell them about the million, tell them about your million dollars.
[418:03.37]Today we're going to play DOS.
[418:06.73]You would never be able to hold that in.
[418:09.75]That's how you get, like... No.
[418:20.32]I would tell my mom.
[418:27.59]I would just suddenly remove the ability for people to sub and donate.
[418:32.61]Yeah, but that would be kind of suspicious, though.
[418:36.45]Wait a minute, Jerma.
[418:37.25]Why did you disable all subs and all donation and all bits?
[418:41.04]I don't know.
[418:42.60]I just kind of felt like it.
[418:45.40]I have enough.
[418:47.12]What do you mean?
[418:49.30]What's that mean?
[418:50.00]Tell them about the million.
[418:50.86]Quick!
[418:58.40]No.
[418:59.84]Unfortunately, I'm not a millionaire.
[419:04.82]Oh, well.
[419:08.17]Didn't win the jackpot on the slot machine.
[419:18.08]A million burgers.
[419:29.02]Hey, thank you to Espada Escolado for the $2.50.
[419:37.35]Hey gentlemen, I just want to say that despite this being an absolute day from hell, and my first day at my new job, um, I'm sorry to hear that.
[419:47.63]Your stream is really helping me and my nerves.
[419:50.51]Physically, I'm fine.
[419:51.63]I'll be okay mentally and all that with time.
[419:53.25]Just wanted to say thanks from the bottom of my heart.
[419:54.78]They say, long story short, I was very nearly shot today.
[419:58.76]Holy shit.
[420:02.34]Stay safe.
[420:03.44]That's fucking sounds pretty terrifying.
[420:12.13]I'm not sure the details there, but thankfully you're alright.
[420:16.09]Hopefully nothing... Hopefully nobody was hurt or nothing happened there.
[420:21.08]But I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[420:29.52]Take care of yourself.
[420:30.18]Stay safe.
[420:30.96]That goes for all of you.
[420:37.93]But thank you for the $2.50.
[420:38.97]I really appreciate it.
[420:45.05]Did I get, uh, these, the five subs from AM, AM Clockwork?
[420:49.25]I did, right?
[420:49.69]Yeah.
[420:50.15]Well, thank you again, Clockwork.
[420:59.10]Modest Narcissist, thanks for the five dollars.
[421:02.82]Hey, Gerber, your streams always make the last couple hours of my workday a lot more bearable.
[421:07.20]Before I have to close for the night, I wanted to give a small bit of my paycheck as thanks.
[421:11.56]Keep up the good work and have a good night.
[421:13.98]You as well.
[421:15.25]Thank you for the $5.
[421:16.45]Really appreciate it.
[421:19.93]Hopefully closing up went well.
[421:23.79]Thank you.
[421:28.47]We just had 1,000 bits.
[421:30.35]$10 from Bet3.
[421:33.11]Are you going to be at San Diego TwitchCon?
[421:37.53]San Diego?
[421:38.69]Is it in San Diego?
[421:41.13]Um... Yeah, I think maybe.
[421:44.59]I don't know.
[421:45.79]It's going to be really tough.
[421:47.71]I have not decided if I'm going to actually be at TwitchCon or not.
[421:51.49]And it's for one very specific reason.
[421:54.34]Because... That Carnival stream is on the 21st.
[422:00.12]And I don't know how... I might... Because I'm not going to be able to stream...
[422:07.48]I'm not gonna be able to stream for almost a week before that stream happens.
[422:11.88]I will be in this facility getting everything set up and moving stuff and helping set up sets and talking to people and telling people where I want things.
[422:23.91]I mean, I'm gonna be there for probably like five days before.
[422:27.25]21st of September.
[422:29.50]So I won't be live for a while and then come back.
[422:33.22]Oh, hey, it's like the 23rd, 24th.
[422:34.62]And then what, just stream like for a day or two?
[422:38.56]And then leave again for like four or five days?
[422:39.96]You know what I'm saying?
[422:43.96]I would only be live for like two days out of like two and a half weeks.
[422:47.43]And I don't know if I want to do that.
[422:54.89]The idea is that I would probably go for a short duration.
[423:00.56]Because I really will only have like a day or two to kind of get back to normal.
[423:04.78]And then I'm leaving again to go to TwitchCon.
[423:08.00]So we'll see.
[423:08.66]I may or may not be there for like a day or two.
[423:13.41]I've not 100% decided yet.
[423:15.87]I do have a ticket though, because I made sure to get one.
[423:18.31]I have a TwitchCon ticket.
[423:21.95]So it's not like I'm going to be like locked out or anything.
[423:34.93]But... Uh... Maybe.
[423:38.81]We'll see.
[423:43.53]There'll be a clown car at this carnival stream.
[423:46.67]How would I not have clowns at a carnival?
[424:05.93]If you want to help advertise the Carnival Stream, you should put something about it on your offline screen.
[424:09.84]Yeah, as we get closer... There's going to be a lot more.
[424:17.44]I'll be talking about it a lot more.
[424:20.28]And potentially even the companies that are involved.
[424:24.42]Because I know that I'm going to be... You'll know who's behind a lot of this.
[424:31.57]It's not just going to be this nameless, faceless company.
[424:34.76]You'll know who's helped out a lot, so... We'll go... I don't have that information yet, so... But... Thank you for the 10 bucks, Pet 3.
[424:48.09]Not sure yet.
[424:49.71]Creamy Sensation, thanks for the $5.
[424:51.47]This is Doom, but... Doom Slayer went to heaven instead of hell.
[425:03.85]That was for the Bible game.
[425:05.14]I forgot about that game.
[425:06.26]It's been a weird night, huh?
[425:10.00]Thank you to Fussrow for the $5.
[425:11.76]Jerma, I'm playing Dark Souls for the first time.
[425:14.84]What's the best build?
[425:15.78]Do you have any tips?
[425:20.54]I'm sorry.
[425:20.98]I might be the worst person to ask.
[425:27.13]The best weapon in Dark Souls remastered.
[425:31.39]Um...
[425:36.93]Doesn't, isn't Dark Souls 1 have like a lot of usable weapons?
[425:46.45]You can pretty much use anything.
[425:54.08]Have you tried playing a good game instead?
[425:56.22]Whoa.
[425:59.28]Hold on, whoops.
[426:01.76]Hit the brakes on that one for a second.
[426:05.92]I mean, yeah, the first 12-15 hours of Dark Souls 1 is incredible, and then the middle 10 hours is puke-inducing and awful.
[426:18.25]But then the last 20 hours are absolutely fantastic.
[426:28.09]So a majority of that game is incredible.
[426:30.29]So you can forget about the middle part.
[426:34.01]It's the fucking lettuce.
[426:34.95]You can take the lettuce out if you want.
[426:36.47]Just eat the burger.
[426:49.86]Dark Souls is a 60-hour game?
[426:51.94]Yeah, I mean, all the Soulsborne games.
[426:55.02]Your first playthrough...
[426:57.46]That always takes like 30 to 50 hours because you have no idea what the hell you're doing or where you're going.
[427:14.17]The Dark Souls one is still a great game though.
[427:15.95]It's still a really, really good game.
[427:26.11]Lettuce is unimportant on anything.
[427:30.47]Lettuce is kind of just crunchy water.
[427:37.00]But sometimes crunchy water is really important on some stuff.
[427:42.30]Thank you, Bananarism, for the $5.90.
[427:45.08]They say chug, chug, chug.
[427:47.26]I'm not sure what I was chugging at the time.
[427:50.65]Or what you wanted me to chug.
[427:53.91]But I didn't.
[427:58.49]Uh, thank you to Dr. Uh, Dr. Enak.
[428:02.61]For the $20, $10 twice in a row.
[428:05.27]Say, I love MS DOS nights.
[428:06.93]I do too.
[428:10.51]Sometimes I get really, really overstimulated when we do this, though.
[428:13.55]Because there's so many different colors and loud sounds and music and weird fucked up shit.
[428:20.69]And after like four to five hours, six hours of doing DOS, I kind of just like, my brain turns to mush.
[428:31.19]But I do love doing it.
[428:32.27]It's so much fun just to see all the... It's like you never know what you're gonna get.
[428:35.29]It's a... It's a box of chocolates.
[428:42.03]And some of the chocolates are filled with acid.
[428:51.52]But thank you for the 20 bucks.
[428:52.42]I really appreciate it.
[428:54.18]Flanktank, thanks for three bucks.
[428:55.54]How much money would it take for you to stream on Mixer full-time?
[429:05.81]Look, listen, let me tell you something.
[429:09.26]This is a very, very easy answer.
[429:13.38]I made the switch to a different platform before.
[429:18.76]I went from YouTube to Twitch.
[429:22.53]And I think it's probably taken...
[429:26.52]A couple years to really have everybody understand that I'm here.
[429:30.66]I made a switch.
[429:33.80]So switching from YouTube to Twitch and then from Twitch to another platform.
[429:38.82]I feel like that's like the second platform switch.
[429:42.96]I don't know if I have it in me to do like another platform switch again.
[429:46.18]Now, I mean...
[429:49.86]I don't know if Twitch, for some reason, starts to really become like a company or as a company that I don't really want to be a part of and I'd rather try something else.
[429:59.13]I mean, that conversation will happen to myself.
[430:09.92]Would I do it for millions of dollars?
[430:14.60]I mean, that's like, but that's like saying, yes, I probably would because that's like,
[430:20.81]You want me to be like, no, I wouldn't do that.
[430:22.76]How dare they even decide... You know what I could do with a million dollars?
[430:26.88]You know what I could do with two fucking million dollars?
[430:39.90]I would make a goddamn movie.
[430:44.00]I would do... There would be all kinds of crazy shit that I would do on those streams.
[430:56.31]But no, I mean, I'd be lying to you guys if I did.
[430:59.42]And I think a majority of people would probably be lying to you.
[431:02.20]If it was like, hey, would you like switch over for like a million dollars?
[431:05.98]No, no, I don't think so.
[431:08.26]I don't believe so.
[431:09.28]I would probably continue to stay here.
[431:11.30]I don't know.
[431:13.42]Yes.
[431:15.28]That's like literally life-changing fucking never have to work again a day in your life money.
[431:20.09]Yeah, obviously, like, you're gonna do it.
[431:22.87]If it's just... Well, maybe not everybody would do it.
[431:26.29]For various reasons, but... Two or three million dollars.
[431:33.37]That's every cent you'd ever need until you were buried.
[431:48.52]I'd burn through that money quick.
[431:50.48]No, I wouldn't.
[431:53.22]I would not.
[431:55.04]I would do the thing where... I would hire... Okay, if I came into a couple million dollars tomorrow, right?
[432:04.45]The first thing I would do, I would hire a lawyer.
[432:08.07]I would get a really, really good lawyer.
[432:10.39]And I would say, I want you to make a contract that I have to sign to dump my money into a vault that I cannot open.
[432:20.76]know what I'm saying like I want you to I want to put a million dollars into a vault that I'm not allowed to touch like retirement account type just put it into a big safe and don't give me the combination but you don't get to have it though like he's like okay I'll just take it no no no like I eventually you tell me like after 10 years you tell me what the combination is so how do I have access to it I don't until 10 10 years ago yeah trust
[432:53.51]Two million dollars to stop streaming, would you leave us?
[432:58.33]What do you mean stop?
[432:58.95]Like, can I do anything else?
[433:01.09]Can I do, can I like, do anything else?
[433:03.47]Can I like, go back to YouTube?
[433:09.16]No, I have to just leave the internet?
[433:13.29]Wait, but you're telling me two million dollars and I have to just delete all my accounts and just literally, like, just don't do anything else.
[433:21.90]No, I don't know if I... That, you're giving me, like, the fucking, the two buttons thing where the guy's like, oh, shit.
[433:37.09]I don't know.
[433:38.53]I don't think I could do it.
[433:39.33]I don't think I could do it.
[433:40.09]What else?
[433:40.37]What the fuck else would I do?
[433:43.72]I mean, if we had two million dollars, we wouldn't have to do anything.
[433:47.72]Right?
[433:48.00]You could just, like, invest half of it and then just, like, sit on a beach every day.
[433:53.40]But I think I would get bored.
[433:54.48]I would get bored.
[433:56.97]I would be like, oh, this is fucking great.
[433:58.85]And after, like, fucking three years, I'd be like, I need to do something.
[434:02.61]I can't stream anymore.
[434:03.51]I can't, like, make a video.
[434:06.95]I'd go nuts.
[434:17.27]Three years is generous.
[434:18.27]It would probably, yeah.
[434:20.65]That is, it would take like probably two weeks.
[434:23.60]No, it would be more than that.
[434:24.90]It would be like a, after like two or three months.
[434:33.93]But, I was always under the impression that I was going to do this until I didn't think it was interesting or fun anymore.
[434:45.50]And if that hasn't happened yet, then I will never, no matter, like, oh, yeah, give me $10 million and stop streaming forever.
[434:53.18]I am not satisfied yet.
[434:55.90]And if I'm not completely satisfied and not completely, like, full, then it would always bother me.
[435:10.97]You know what I mean?
[435:19.90]Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars if you stop to keep streaming until it stops being fun.
[435:25.03]The only way that I would actually accept a million dollars from anybody that was somebody that was watching the channel was if you could prove somehow.
[435:33.67]You would have to go through like an underwriter to prove that you have like a hundred million dollars.
[435:39.31]That's the only way I'd ever accept that.
[435:41.97]You'd have to go through, like, a mortgage company to prove that you can, like, do that.
[435:47.13]Like, a thousand times over.
[435:49.43]No, not the Undertaker.
[435:50.47]An underwriter.
[436:03.04]Destroy him.
[436:08.07]But no, I don't know.
[436:10.05]I don't know if I could do that.
[436:12.81]I don't know.
[436:13.53]Dude, I've got this weird... I don't know if I want... I don't want to have a bunch of money.
[436:20.20]It kind of freaks me out.
[436:21.14]I don't want like 10, 20... I don't want like 50 million dollars.
[436:23.62]What the fuck am I going to do with that money?
[436:25.48]I'd panic.
[436:27.62]I'd buy like five boats just because I'd be like, I don't know what to do.
[436:30.24]Should I buy boats?
[436:45.00]You did do that in that life simulator.
[436:51.89]If I had, like, a hundred million fucking dollars, I would do wacky shit.
[436:57.39]I would be that weird guy.
[436:58.33]I would have a fucking top hat and a cape and shit, and I would just, like, hold events where I dumped, like, 500 grand out of a Zeppelin.
[437:06.62]You know what I mean?
[437:12.40]I'd be fucking, like, a crazy person.
[437:16.06]I would hold, like, contests impromptu on, like, the beach or on the street or something.
[437:22.85]Like, who can eat Skittles and, like, spit the furthest?
[437:26.27]Oh, and by the way, the person that does it the furthest gets $50,000.
[437:28.79]Not like, oh, $50. $50.
[437:51.08]Chase the second I open up.
[437:53.40]Okay.
[437:53.88]Congratulations.
[437:54.82]Yeah, you won the spinning contest.
[437:56.92]What was that?
[437:57.44]Let me see.
[437:58.14]They lick my fingers.
[437:59.00]What's in here?
[437:59.72]Okay, so that you were gonna get five grand and uh, there's so many hundreds in here Please nobody fucking attack me.
[438:06.75]No, that would not work.
[438:07.57]You're right I would get like strangled on the street
[438:24.16]And be like, wait, how much money has he got in there?
[438:26.06]No, no, it's not that much.
[438:27.96]I'd start, like, running.
[438:30.82]But then I would do, like, the fucking cartoon.
[438:33.29]You know the cartoon, like, oil spill behind you?
[438:35.97]That they do when, in all of those, any time that a character in a racing cartoon or in a video game or any point when somebody is in a race and the bad guy drops the oil behind them.
[438:47.55]That would be money.
[438:48.27]I would just, like, throw a fucking thousand dollars behind me and just keep going.
[438:59.17]Oh, I would like wad up like fucking 10 grand into like a big wad fist and just like baseball throw it like over a roof or something and just keep running.
[439:10.40]So it would just like land in an alleyway and then all of a sudden like, oh, there he goes.
[439:13.74]Well, who cares?
[439:25.53]We can tell you think of this a lot.
[439:40.47]What if you were a billionaire?
[439:42.31]No, a billionaire- I would just be in- I would just sit in VR all day.
[439:47.25]I would just pay somebody to make like a- a VR game that I just played, it was mine.
[440:07.90]Would you still stream?
[440:09.40]No.
[440:10.98]I don't think I would.
[440:17.14]Ah, my fucking stomach.
[440:21.04]Just buy a state.
[440:22.62]Yeah, what the hell?
[440:25.64]You know how when people that are millionaires get bored, they buy baseball teams and like soccer teams?
[440:32.38]When billionaires get bored, why don't they just buy a state?
[440:37.75]Or just have a bunch of, like, just make a new, like, land off the coast of fucking California.
[440:46.11]Have, like, a 20 mile radius, like, land built.
[440:50.62]And just call it something.
[440:52.60]And see if you can get added to the fucking 50, see if you can become the 50, like, first state.
[441:29.02]Let us in.
[441:29.86]That'd be fine.
[441:31.82]We could just put, like, we could all, all of us, the whole Jerma community could just live there.
[441:44.60]Some of the things you guys say are fucking crazy.
[441:53.31]That would be a fucking shit show.
[441:54.73]Yeah, how would we even get water?
[441:58.95]I didn't think that through.
[441:59.81]I'd have to hire a bunch of plumbers to make water come through pipes.
[442:04.27]We'd have to have a sewer system.
[442:06.09]How would we do that?
[442:10.15]The ocean.
[442:10.61]You can't drink ocean water.
[442:12.43]It has to be...
[442:15.58]desalted.
[442:16.26]It's got to be processed.
[442:17.36]Where's that going to go?
[442:24.97]What about a military?
[442:28.75]Oh, yeah.
[442:39.62]I wouldn't have a military.
[442:40.90]But then what if I just got taken over?
[443:03.72]It would be like, here we go.
[443:05.84]And it's the grand opening of Juma Island.
[443:09.40]And here it is.
[443:10.42]Cut the ribbon.
[443:11.20]Welcome, everybody.
[443:12.30]We're going to do just fine.
[443:14.34]And then just cut.
[443:17.42]It's just like, decayed land, people screaming.
[443:37.94]He was trying to pump water!
[443:39.34]He's been pumping salt water in!
[443:43.72]Every time we take showers, it's just like salt water gets in our eyes.
[443:47.24]He's a maniac.
[443:55.75]That'd be a great movie, yeah?
[443:57.01]That would be a great fucking movie.
[443:59.53]What a good movie that would be.
[444:00.89]I want to see this movie.
[444:02.99]A guy with like a trillion dollars makes his own land, his own like country off the coast of the Pacific.
[444:09.86]And like the crazy, wild shit that would have to happen to get that to work.
[444:14.39]And then what would actually happen?
[444:15.73]What kind of potential crazy shit would happen?
[444:21.43]It's called... No, it's not Jurassic Park.
[444:25.42]That's a Will Ferrell comedy.
[444:26.82]Well, hire him!
[444:29.10]He still pulls numbers.
[444:36.78]That'll be a 2.8 on Rotten Tomatoes.
[444:38.51]That doesn't matter.
[444:45.49]It's Lord of the Flies.
[444:46.35]Yeah, but Lord of the Flies didn't have a billion dollars.
[444:55.74]It already exists.
[445:00.26]Let me see.
[445:02.75]Hold on.
[445:05.79]What is this movie?
[445:13.40]It'll be a bad it'll be it'll be two point.
[445:15.70]No, I'm just making it animated Doesn't all animated movies have like 80 to 90 percent on Rotten Tomatoes guaranteed Into the billionaire verse
[445:48.41]You have no idea how trash some animated movies are.
[445:50.85]Yeah.
[445:51.73]Alright, but like... Listen, somebody put up... What?
[445:55.54]Sausage party does not count.
[446:09.11]It already exists.
[446:17.34]What the hell are you talking about?
[446:27.15]Sea land?
[446:40.44]This already exists?
[446:49.18]The Principality of Sealand, commonly known as Sealand, is a micronation.
[446:59.42]What?
[447:06.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[447:07.44]I'm sorry, guys.
[447:08.28]Hold on a minute here.
[447:10.14]This is a helicopter pad.
[447:13.18]This is not like a whole city.
[447:35.38]Similar, no, it would have to be like, okay, it wouldn't listen It would have to be that this place would have to be the like the size of Rhode Island What would that be like five hundred trillion dollars
[447:53.89]Like BioShock.
[448:03.03]Wait, you're telling me it wouldn't cost a billion dollars to build a city as big as Rhode Island?
[448:10.29]It costs more than a billion dollars to put up a new casino on the Strip.
[448:15.53]That would be like a hundred trillion dollars.
[448:31.59]Alright, we've been on the, like, billionaire makes his own, like, cartoon island for like 40 minutes.
[448:41.56]We gotta get out of here.
[448:52.48]It's a jaw-dropping shame how bad your money and number management skills are.
[448:55.94]You're 35.
[448:58.36]We're talking about a Looney Tunes bit.
[449:02.48]I'm sorry, I don't have the necessary mathematical knowledge of how much it would take to build a fucking new country as big as Rhode Island.
[449:14.74]Who the hell has that information?
[449:16.18]That information doesn't exist!
[449:27.64]I didn't, like, miss a decimal on my tax return.
[449:33.27]This is like a Dr. Eggman plot.
[449:47.21]Maybe there's a reason that you're not rich.
[449:54.62]Hey, yep.
[449:56.74]Maybe.
[449:57.04]Alright, here we go.
[450:00.38]Let's keep going.
[450:04.54]We're at the end here.
[450:07.37]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[450:08.59]Thanks for the $2.50.
[450:09.15]Hey, Garfield.
[450:09.97]What's up?
[450:12.43]Garf, Garf.
[450:13.47]We are the Garfs.
[450:14.41]Celebrating yet another birthday snarf.
[450:17.09]And Jeremy, you had such a good stream this year.
[450:18.99]Had some of my bits.
[450:19.84]Wow.
[450:20.08]We all cheer.
[450:21.06]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[450:22.40]Welcome back.
[450:27.44]Thanks for the $2.50.
[450:29.14]And so.
[450:30.64]Let's get the credits on here.
[450:33.23]All the subs.
[450:34.19]Thanks, everybody.
[450:35.67]I'll see you tomorrow.
[450:37.61]Terraria.
[450:38.51]At some point in the afternoon.
[450:39.41]I'm not sure exactly when.
[450:42.41]Did that not go through?
[450:43.53]Why did that not go through?
[450:44.47]What's going on here?
[450:47.53]Uh-oh.
[450:49.91]Well, that took a while to go through for some reason.
[450:53.43]But, once again, thanks, guys.
[450:58.22]For all the support.
[450:58.88]It means a lot.
[451:00.18]It's a fucking lot of subs.
[451:07.92]There are a couple more bits to do.
[451:13.14]We have Demonic Cucumber.
[451:15.26]Just gave three bucks.
[451:17.35]You can donate $50 to Sealand and they'll make you a duke.
[451:21.41]How much to become a duke of Jurema Island?
[451:25.97]You wouldn't be able to do that.
[451:27.31]You can't pay me to play your Mario Maker level, so I have to stick to that.
[451:39.03]Jerm Island.
[451:45.74]Uh, thank you to, uh, thank you to, uh, Django Ogogo for the 10 bucks.
[451:50.74]10 dollars from, uh, Django Ogogo.
[451:56.40]They say, for all my life, I've lived in one state.
[451:59.60]And for the first time in my life, I'm moving many states away.
[452:03.46]I'm pretty sad about moving so far away from my family.
[452:06.36]It's a tough thing to do.
[452:08.38]But no matter where I am, you and the community will be a family that I can always come to and feel like I'm in good company.
[452:14.32]So to you, Jerma, thank you for the entertainment and the creativity.
[452:17.70]And to the chat, thank you for being the other half of my jukes.
[452:21.80]I love y'all.
[452:22.88]That's wholesome.
[452:26.38]I can relate to this very, very personally because I did that.
[452:30.11]I just traveled across the whole country to live in a place that I've never been in before.
[452:35.45]I've traveled to Las Vegas a few times before moving here.
[452:41.35]But yeah, nobody else, none of my hometown friends or family members, nobody's out here.
[452:47.64]So it's a little different.
[452:48.44]You have to kind of get used to it.
[452:53.53]But I love it out here.
[452:54.83]I loved it.
[452:56.54]I think it was the right change.
[452:57.84]I think it was the right move.
[453:02.78]So... We are all more than happy to have a fun community here.
[453:12.07]Can all kind of collectively... Hopefully enjoy the same things.
[453:17.77]Where am I from?
[453:18.35]I'm from Massachusetts.
[453:24.71]so I moved out to Vegas just under a year ago it'll be a year in October yeah but thank you for the 10 bucks really appreciate it uh thank you to uh jen pendulum for the five dollars
[453:50.90]I don't know how expensive the whole carnival stream thing is, but here's some bits to help you out.
[453:57.02]Maybe one day we'll talk, like I did the Jerma Rumble.
[454:00.24]But I don't want that to be a point of contention or talk about that until much later.
[454:06.18]I don't really want to talk about, like, how much money this stream is going to cost.
[454:10.99]I mean, I think I said a little bit, a few, maybe like a month ago or so.
[454:17.37]But that's not important.
[454:19.67]Maybe we'll talk about it some other time.
[454:23.58]But I do thank you so much for the $5.
[454:24.86]Appreciate it.
[454:28.18]That was a gen pendulum.
[454:29.30]Thank you.
[454:32.50]Vilemi gave $10.
[454:34.22]They said chew... No, not chew the dew.
[454:37.52]Chug the dew.
[454:38.69]Jeremy, you already signed the contract.
[454:46.45]Aren't they paying you to do this?
[454:47.79]No.
[454:48.27]No, no, no, no.
[454:48.77]Other way around.
[454:51.29]I have hired a couple of companies to help me do this.
[454:58.37]I was not hired by... This is not... This is me hiring people.
[455:17.98]I was not approached for this.
[455:20.51]I have been trying to approach people for this for about a year.
[455:29.85]And no, it is not a Massachusetts-based company.
[455:33.43]They're somewhere else.
[455:39.56]And that's it.
[455:40.80]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[455:42.32]Thanks for hanging out.
[455:43.44]DOS is always fun.
[455:44.54]See you tomorrow for Terraria.
[455:48.38]Have a good rest of your night.
[455:50.24]Take care.
[455:52.04]And goodbye.
[455:54.42]Get some sleep.
[456:06.33]We got one more bit that came in.
[456:07.29]I have one more right now.
[456:08.77]By Snooze and Copter.
[456:09.55]250 from Snooze and Copter.
[456:10.67]They say, Hey Germo, when you don't know where you want to be or where you want to go, what do you do?
[456:16.19]Except for waiting it out.
[456:17.03]I'm sure you and everyone can relate.
[456:18.79]I want to hear your thoughts.
[456:20.21]When you don't know where you want to be or where you want to go.
[456:27.99]I think... Well, for me at least.
[456:32.59]In regards to where I wanted to be.
[456:36.47]I kind of just wanted to be somewhere that I knew I was going to wake up every day and be at least interested in where I was and what I was doing.
[456:47.94]At least in a territorial sense.
[456:53.43]But in a more elaborate sense of where you want to be or where you want to go.
[456:59.53]I always was of the mindset that
[457:02.21]you kind of pick a few things that you like and try to have one of them or a combination of them work out.
[457:12.49]Find what you're interested in.
[457:13.53]Find at least two or three things that you really are interested in and be happy with any of those things.
[457:20.42]I think a lot of times people can get stuck by putting all their eggs in one basket when you should have a few baskets that you are equally excited about.
[457:29.76]And as long as one of them works out, then you're happy.
[457:37.26]Trying to find what you're interested in and then... Spread out the eggs a little.
[457:51.96]Get into the carnival business now.
[457:55.92]But it's tough because it's tough because everybody is interested in different things.
[458:00.70]But I'll tell you, just, I wanted to do entertainment.
[458:04.08]I wanted to be like an entertainer, actor, comedian, whatever.
[458:09.03]That was one of, but also I wanted to work with animals.
[458:12.29]I was really, really into the idea of getting into, I like love dogs.
[458:17.62]I love cat, I love animals, right?
[458:19.46]So that was another, I'm really into that.
[458:22.17]Another one was doing customer service.
[458:25.51]Like, I like talking to people.
[458:27.09]I'm big into having conversations.
[458:29.78]So with customer service field, customer, not necessarily support, but... So any of those three things I was going to be happy with, because I was actually really interested in all three of them.
[458:42.40]If I had been... Let's say, for instance, I never did anything on Twitch or YouTube.
[458:49.41]And instead I fell into like a vet clinic, right?
[458:55.09]I would be very happy.
[458:57.19]If I was like a vet tech or somebody that worked in the veterinary field, right?
[459:09.74]Or combine them, you know?
[459:12.25]Find a few things that you like to do and be happy doing any of them.
[459:17.62]A comedian for pets.
[459:36.02]Combine them all.
[459:36.96]Be a clown vet.
[459:40.99]But that is honestly the only advice I can really give.
[459:45.47]I've been very fortunate to do something and sort of fall into and do something that I really, really, really wanted to do.
[459:50.89]That I was really, really happy and passionate about.
[459:55.35]Very, very fortunate to be able to do that.
[459:59.72]But I was prepared to fall back on one of those other couple of things.
[460:10.22]And that's pretty much what I've got to say.
[460:14.54]I wish you luck.
[460:15.36]I wish you the best.
[460:19.00]Sometimes you need a change of scenery.
[460:20.66]Sometimes you do.
[460:27.24]Moving, and even changing towns, or going a few miles away.
[460:34.06]If you've been in the same place for a while, it can help.
[460:44.53]But with that, I will see you all tomorrow.
[460:46.22]Have a great rest of your night.
[460:49.63]Get some sleep.
[460:50.03]See you tomorrow.
[460:53.15]Good night.
[461:16.67]you
