[03:05.99]I know the rules of the road.
[03:07.15]I know exactly the situations as a driver and as a passenger, how to get you guys prepared.
[03:12.44]So let's go ahead and we'll start doing that.
[03:15.62]I just want to give a few minutes here.

[04:16.84]It's going to be the United States.
[04:18.08]I know some people are going to say, well, you're doing this all wrong, but it's because you're from a different country.
[04:23.57]So let's go.
[04:24.19]Let's start with career driving school student.
[04:28.37]I'm not a student.
[04:29.29]I am the master, but it's okay.
[04:31.87]We're going to learn how to, let's see, novice experienced.
[04:36.39]Let's go with yard driving.
[04:38.02]Driving in your yard?
[04:40.62]What?
[04:43.36]Professional, I mean like
[04:46.43]Let's just start at the beginning, you know.
[04:51.72]We're just going to start.
[04:52.86]I'm going to tell you what I know about the rules.
[04:55.94]This is probably going to be loud.
[04:57.10]I hope it's not, but it probably will be.
[04:59.68]In this simple exercise, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the class where you will learn how to start off and shift gears.
[05:07.02]It's important to wear your belt before you start to drive.
[05:09.74]To belt up, press the share button.
[05:17.53]Yeah Share button doesn't sure about name working Why am I going backwards?
[05:30.28]Okay, hold on Pressing start made the car go backwards by the way something ain't right here hold on Controls gamepad ps4
[05:47.57]Wait, I have one, two, three.
[05:52.34]This ain't right.
[05:52.94]Alright, we're going to forego the controller.
[05:56.82]And we're just going to put on the keyboard.
[05:58.78]Because that apparently doesn't want to work.
[06:01.82]We're going to start again.
[06:02.70]Okay, here we go.
[06:03.26]Pretend you didn't see that.
[06:05.30]How do you shift gears?
[06:11.25]It's important to wear your belt.

[06:36.05]B, put the seatbelt on, E, turn the left signal on with that.
[06:45.11]Okay.
[06:46.61]Parking brake is space.
[06:49.17]Why can't any game have a fucking automatic?
[06:52.93]And then you go to first gear.
[06:54.53]Yeah, okay.
[06:55.01]We're in first gear.
[06:58.49]To start off, either depress the accelerator pedal or press up add-on.
[07:01.34]That's not working.
[07:05.28]There we go.
[07:06.44]Okay.
[07:07.10]There we go.

[07:17.79]Cars aren't this loud.
[07:24.96]Well, we need to turn that down.
[07:26.26]At least I know how to drive.
[07:29.28]Alright.
[07:30.72]V-E.
[07:35.38]Turn on the left signal.
[07:36.34]Alright, there's the left signal.
[07:38.77]Get that parking brake up, let's get into first gear.
[07:41.19]Okay.

[08:03.04]Okay, is that better?
[08:06.30]It's not really that better.
[08:09.22]Okay, so here we go, we're fine.
[08:11.83]Shift into second gear, depress the clutch with T, get that into second gear.
[08:17.93]Easy.
[08:20.81]This is an instructor.
[08:23.24]Holy shit.
[08:25.10]Alright, shift back to first gear, yep.

[08:44.97]Okay, so we're going to stop right here.
[08:52.30]There we go, okay.
[08:54.60]Set the parking brake with space.
[08:57.78]And we did it.
[09:00.04]Okay, good, let's go.
[09:03.72]Here we go.
[09:04.28]No, I don't want to fucking, let's just go.
[09:06.63]Yard driving.
[09:10.73]Alright, where are we gonna go?
[09:11.85]I know how to drive now.
[09:14.35]Uh, we can go old city, new city.
[09:17.80]And we're gonna do, uh, we're gonna go to the business district.
[09:21.40]That's good.
[09:23.36]Uh, the kind of car I'm gonna do is, I don't want a fucking standard.
[09:28.55]Should I do a Prius?
[09:31.00]You can do truck.
[09:33.22]These are all locked, so it doesn't really matter.
[09:35.54]Let's go with this one.
[09:36.96]Let's go with the twitch.tv car, the purple one.
[09:39.12]Automatic gearbox.
[09:40.80]Anti-lock brake system.
[09:43.25]With a learner plate.
[09:44.55]Novice driver?
[09:45.57]What?
[09:48.17]Automatic gearbox.
[09:52.31]Why can I do that?
[09:52.91]Oh, there we go.
[09:54.75]Okay.
[09:54.85]Well, I don't want to do that.
[09:55.81]Transport.
[09:56.05]Transport.
[09:59.27]Uh, foggy, rainy, it was gonna do clear.
[10:03.26]Traffic, uh, we gotta do high traffic.
[10:07.92]70%.
[10:08.14]Uh, fast-moving traffic, aggressive traffic, and a shitload of pedestrians.
[10:15.24]Wait, what did that say?
[10:17.20]Streets are overcrowded, making driving almost impossible.
[10:23.03]Emergency situations?
[10:24.41]Dangerous change of traffic.
[10:26.77]Very often.
[10:27.51]Emergency braking cars all the time.
[10:29.97]Dangerous entrance of vehicle to the oncoming lane.
[10:32.79]Often.
[10:33.53]Pedestrian crossing the road in the wrong place.
[10:35.45]Very often.
[10:37.71]Always.
[10:38.17]No.
[10:38.47]No fucking traffic controller.
[10:39.90]Braking of traffic light.
[10:40.98]Yeah, like sometimes.
[10:44.50]I feel like we're going 0 to 100 right now.
[10:47.32]Should I have not done that right off the bat?
[10:51.56]I don't know.
[10:56.35]I just turned it into GTA.
[11:01.37]Why did it... Okay, so we're going to do... Turn the car on.
[11:05.83]Let's get this thing into gear.
[11:08.02]It's already on.
[11:08.78]Get this thing into first gear.
[11:13.36]And here we go.
[11:14.38]Okay.
[11:20.94]How come I can't change the gear?
[11:23.52]I'm in park, but it's supposed to be T, right?
[11:27.34]T and then like S or W. Uh, what?
[11:35.24]T, S. T, W. And why am I in the other... I don't want the... I want fucking the... What?
[11:46.03]Clutch, T. Previous gear, S. I mean, do I just hit 1, 2 now?
[11:54.85]The tutorial didn't fucking do it.
[11:59.36]Uh, okay, well, what the fuck?
[12:01.70]Now, we'll just go to drive.
[12:04.44]Drive.
[12:04.76]Alright, well, I just fucking killed that lady, so... Alright, how do I get a better view?
[12:17.48]What is my goal here, by the way?
[12:18.88]Alright, alright, let's get on the road.
[12:26.84]Holy shit, man.
[12:27.82]Like, this is way too fucking loud.
[12:29.42]It really is.
[12:33.06]Apply.
[12:34.18]Continue.
[12:35.44]That's a little better.
[12:38.82]How do I get a different camera?
[12:43.51]Let me go like this.
[12:44.61]Wear your seatbelt.
[12:45.55]Oh, shit.
[12:46.31]Put my seatbelt on.
[12:49.53]Let me see.
[12:49.87]How do I get a better fucking view?
[12:53.96]All-wheel drive.
[12:55.24]Boost mode?
[12:56.06]Why is there a boost mode in a game like this?
[12:59.52]Horn, seatbelt, view.
[13:00.86]Next camera, C. Okay, that's how it works.
[13:08.08]This is like regular GTA.
[13:10.30]What's going on?
[13:10.72]Oh, I'm in reverse.
[13:16.24]Okay, back in drive.
[13:17.74]You want to do this view?
[13:18.54]Alright, let's boost it.
[13:23.52]Alright, so like this is literally, we're just playing GTA.
[13:26.94]I think I'm like going through.
[13:35.62]I'm supposed to be teaching you guys how to drive a car, so hold on.
[13:40.51]Here, this is better.
[13:45.21]What is with these odd placements?
[13:46.65]Like why is six drive?
[13:50.81]Why is one, two, three?
[13:53.60]Why can I not get to fucking reverse?
[14:00.18]I can't get to reverse.
[14:01.30]It, like, won't let me.
[14:02.64]Somebody just gave a hundred fucking dollars during this mess.
[14:07.59]The game feels bad for me, so it just, like, put me here.
[14:13.01]What happened to the car?
[14:15.37]Hundred dollar driving tutorial.
[14:19.50]There's no sound.
[14:22.01]Use WASD?
[14:23.35]WASD does not do anything.
[14:28.50]Alright, hold on.
[14:29.12]Let me just... Ilvery or Lilvery.
[14:36.74]Hopefully I'm saying your name right.
[14:39.27]Thank you for the $100.
[14:41.86]Says, uh, Evening Jerma, found your videos channel recently and adore your genuine laughter.
[14:46.22]Although at first it was hard not to imagine you as an estranged party clown who vents and mocks party goers through his Twitch stream.
[14:53.48]I still enjoy your videos and content.
[14:54.77]Safe driving and have a good evening.
[14:55.99]Well, thank you.
[14:57.51]Thank you, uh, Ilvery.
[15:00.47]Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[15:02.57]Um, I just wish the button combinations would work in this game.
[15:06.23]And we're not, no, we're not nexting yet.
[15:08.65]I have to at least get 15 minutes of content.
[15:15.16]Like, it doesn't do anything.
[15:16.84]Like, look at the bottom left.
[15:18.04]I'm like fucking clearly pushing on the goddamn thing.
[15:21.42]I'm gonna start over.
[15:24.12]Okay, there we go.
[15:26.28]Let's get this down to reverse.
[15:29.75]Whatever fucking random ass button that is.
[15:31.75]Don't ask me which one it is.
[15:32.77]And now I can't drive this car.
[15:35.79]At least I put my seatbelt on.
[15:38.65]Gotta hit the content code.
[15:39.93]The car is still broken.
[15:48.62]Why does the car keep flipping?
[15:52.74]Like, I'm clearly in drive right now.
[15:55.80]Up on the... It doesn't work.
[16:00.57]What the fuck?
[16:04.49]This was just working.
[16:09.35]Right?
[16:09.63]Like, this was just working.
[16:10.87]I was in drive and I was holding the button down and it was working.
[16:16.94]Alright, so... I just look like a fucking psychopath sitting in my purple car, not going anywhere.
[16:31.07]The engine broke.
[16:31.87]Well, it shouldn't have.
[16:38.44]Alright.
[16:41.18]So...
[16:43.95]We're gonna have to go over here.
[16:45.05]Break a clutch L. Next gear SW.
[16:49.17]Literally fucking put... Drive car is up on the control pad.
[16:58.68]Maybe the car isn't on.
[16:59.94]Well, yeah, it is.
[17:00.58]Alright, well, this has been Driver's Ed.
[17:05.51]Thank you for watching Driver's Ed.
[17:09.13]While I press on the gas and the car don't move.
[17:13.50]I needed to fucking teach you guys certain things.
[17:17.96]Apparently we ain't doing that.
[17:23.51]I can't even get the fucking car to turn on.
[17:27.59]Hold on a minute.
[17:30.89]I was holding E. Didn't do anything.
[17:33.98]Let's get in the fucking truck now.
[17:38.40]No signs, plates.
[17:40.97]Let's do that.
[17:42.74]Time of day.
[17:43.30]Let's just do... We're going to do winter.
[17:47.22]A bunch of fucking ice and snow.
[17:51.42]Evening.
[17:52.10]No, daytime.
[17:54.90]Brute generation.
[17:55.60]Emergency situations.
[17:56.62]I need to see what the fuck this even means.
[17:58.92]Hold on.
[18:02.61]Look, this is on the Steam sale, alright?
[18:05.09]I got like sucked into the Steam sale, and I was like, alright, I'm gonna buy this game on the Steam sale and play it.
[18:11.21]Sometimes it's a dud, sometimes it's a fucking home run.
[18:13.51]Alright, car's on.
[18:21.04]Now let's get this thing into reverse.
[18:29.43]Okay, okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[18:30.95]Okay, so, so, so, so, so, driver's ed, right?
[18:32.63]Listen.
[18:33.81]Listen to me.
[18:35.35]When you're in a situation where it's very snowy out, first of all, we need a break here for this pedestrian.
[18:40.34]I'm going to let this pedestrian go across.
[18:43.54]Police officer right there, always be aware of your surroundings.
[18:46.62]So you see this, up ahead, there's construction.
[18:49.66]So we need to turn right at the construction.
[18:51.01]Construction.
[18:53.26]Very, very softly.
[18:54.08]You don't want to go too fast.
[18:54.98]Less than 20 miles per hour on a turn, guys.
[18:57.58]So we're going to merge into oncoming traffic here.
[19:00.74]And remember, if it's going to be snowy out, you got to make sure that you are aware that the roads are going to be much more slippery during these storms.
[19:09.41]Blinking yellow light.
[19:10.23]That means we have cautions.
[19:11.21]We're going to brake a little bit here.
[19:12.17]We're going to stop just a little bit just to make sure no cars are coming.
[19:16.33]That's what a blinking yellow means.
[19:18.69]Put your pocket seatbelt on because I didn't.
[19:22.92]That was a green light.
[19:23.82]Green light means go.
[19:25.72]Comply with the... Remember, if you ever get pulled over and you get pulled over for speeding, isn't it?
[19:30.48]That's not what we got to talk about.
[19:32.93]Somebody cutting you off.
[19:35.77]Look at this fucking lady.
[19:40.69]Really?
[19:41.01]That is a joke.
[19:48.34]I was going to make a posted speed limit sign thing.
[19:52.51]Watch out, the old people that just walk without any reason, they're just going across this.
[19:56.31]But if you remember, take a look on the right.
[19:59.45]Alright, somebody gave money, first of all, and I can't see it.
[20:03.68]Remember blinking yellow.
[20:05.90]Check the poster speed limits.
[20:07.14]Blinking yellow means slow, means be careful.
[20:09.68]We're in a very densely populated city.
[20:11.30]We wouldn't want anything bad to happen.
[20:14.49]Here is a situation.
[20:15.41]We're gonna put the blinker on Put your right blinker on if you're gonna go right and say you want to make sure that that guy knew that Where I was going turn the blinker off you've already made the turn And remember you want to put on your blinker a good 500 feet before you know you're turning for instance.
[20:30.46]I'm about to take this left I'm gonna slow down here
[20:36.57]And sometimes somebody's going to call you an asshole, but it's okay.
[20:39.03]As long as you don't get in any trouble.
[20:41.75]Do the joke already.
[20:43.69]There is no joke.
[20:48.73]There is no joke.
[20:50.82]You guys are watching it right now.
[20:54.88]You guys are watching the joke.
[20:56.06]The joke was this.
[20:57.10]I hope you guys understand that you're in the joke.
[21:06.91]Wait a minute, hold on.
[21:07.49]Have I been driving the wrong side of the road the entire time?
[21:10.86]No, I haven't.
[21:11.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:13.16]Why am I in the car on the right side?
[21:17.53]This is American rules, but European physiology.
[21:23.05]Okay, let's talk about this.
[21:26.16]Let's talk about this.
[21:26.96]I think I need to look right.
[21:27.86]I look left here.
[21:28.74]So, in this kind of a situation, you want to make sure that you have at least 10 cars worth of movement to be able to go out.
[21:37.00]So, as you can see, like right here is a safe bet for me to take my turn.
[21:39.42]I'm going to put my blinker on and start the turn.
[21:44.38]Make sure you don't drive on the median.
[21:45.52]Okay, and then blinker comes off.
[21:47.18]Traffic sucks.
[21:48.26]Everybody fucking hates traffic.
[21:49.96]But one of the ways to avoid getting angry in traffic.
[21:53.92]This is a very secret thing.
[21:59.13]Just be patient.
[22:00.75]I could have done this in GTA 5.
[22:03.23]Fuck, I just hit this guy.
[22:06.87]Sometimes you coast into somebody.
[22:08.24]I could have done this in like GTA 5.
[22:11.14]Why did I buy this?
[22:13.66]There's no reason to buy this game.
[22:15.48]What do you mean there's no game sound?
[22:20.36]This game sound.
[22:23.50]You don't hear that?
[22:24.28]Fucking come on.
[22:25.12]Get out of the way.
[22:28.00]Just go into... I have sound!
[22:29.68]You guys don't hear this?
[22:32.67]Alright, I gotta, like, move this person out of the way.
[22:34.33]Because this is seriously... Like, you could've just drove.
[22:41.09]We cannot hear anything.
[22:42.47]So you're telling me there is no audio right now?
[22:49.22]Uh, you should be able to hear it.
[22:52.72]Alright, so what... Excuse me?! !
[22:57.85]Alright, what other, like, things can I do in, like, fuck this lady.
[23:03.85]What other, like, GTA things can I do in GTA?
[23:09.72]What is the lower beam?
[23:10.68]I don't even know what that means.
[23:11.64]Alright, I'll turn it back up.
[23:18.54]Yeah, you guys should be able to, first of all, let me see.
[23:23.57]Alright, get the fuck out of the way.
[23:26.36]You can pick a sports car.
[23:27.54]Alright, let's go pick a sports car.
[23:31.00]Let me play Grand Theft Auto.
[23:34.90]Anyways, thank you, Foxy Fury, for the five bucks.
[23:37.57]Drop the transmission again.
[23:38.55]I see, by the way, no in-game sound.
[23:40.27]I think I fixed that.
[23:42.09]Awesome, Alec.
[23:42.61]Thank you for the one dollar.
[23:44.51]Can't hear the engine.
[23:45.39]Clearly, the car's off.
[23:46.41]Seriously, though, there's no game sound.
[23:49.09]Hole of one zombie.
[23:50.35]Thank you for the fifteen dollars.
[23:52.05]I'm walking here.
[23:55.28]Okay.
[23:55.78]Let's do a sports car.
[24:01.18]I could just play Grand Theft Auto.
[24:05.30]I can't unlock any of these.
[24:07.50]I'm just going to have to drive the truck around.
[24:14.17]If any lock breaks, we're going to be the bumblebee.
[24:18.03]Alright.
[24:18.99]Let's go to Old City.
[24:23.51]Modern District.
[24:26.10]Highway.
[24:26.80]Let's just, let's go, let's just, let's try some highway practice.
[24:33.28]Also, thank you to SSBM Icarus for the dollar.
[24:35.70]There are no bit noises or game audio.
[24:40.46]Oh, welcome to, welcome to the fucking stream.
[24:42.24]Let's try this.
[24:52.41]Something about this is very funny to me, though.
[24:55.69]The fact that I could just be doing this in Grand Theft Auto.
[25:01.53]Okay, so let's pop up the clutch.
[25:03.21]Get it open here.
[25:03.83]Okay.
[25:08.77]Turn the car on.
[25:12.09]I don't know why I'm going backwards.
[25:18.81]There we go.
[25:20.25]Wear your seatbelt.
[25:20.97]Put the seatbelt on.
[25:25.71]Alright, that guy just did what I was doing.
[25:30.01]Check my mirrors.
[25:30.77]I don't need to check my mirrors.
[25:32.13]That guy just stopped.
[25:35.19]Why is everybody so bad at this?
[25:37.19]Turn on the lower beam, not gonna happen.
[25:41.23]Should I do this exact same thing in GTA?
[25:44.68]I think I might just do that.
[25:46.54]Like, why are you people driving on the wrong side of the road?
[25:49.20]Alright, hold on.
[25:53.92]My second gear.
[25:55.18]Fuck.
[25:58.61]Uh, hold on, let me put my blinker on.
[26:02.14]Oh, shit.
[26:03.90]We're gonna have to do it.
[26:04.70]We're gonna have to exchange information.
[26:16.19]Next gen.
[26:18.33]People are like trying to go around.
[26:19.54]This one guy's going way too fast.
[26:24.80]Alright, reverse.
[26:26.85]Put it in reverse.
[26:28.03]Like, let's go.
[26:28.89]Reverse!
[26:32.29]I just took my seatbelt off.
[26:35.69]Come on!
[26:38.95]Finally!
[26:39.57]Jesus.
[26:41.88]Okay, back up to one.
[26:46.32]Get that going.
[26:50.46]Okay.
[26:52.48]Go for it.
[26:55.01]Go for it.
[26:57.08]Go.
[26:57.48]Thank you.
[26:58.08]Jesus.
[26:58.58]We need to try to get, like, at a line.
[27:04.80]They're trying to hit me, guys.
[27:06.22]That's what I don't think you understand.
[27:07.44]Alright.
[27:12.26]Next gear.
[27:12.74]Remember, we're in snow, too.
[27:13.82]This is very dangerous.
[27:20.31]75.
[27:20.33]The goal is to get to 100 miles per hour in Grand Theft Auto.
[27:26.07]Okay.
[27:33.08]Alright.
[27:33.34]Who wants to play GTA?
[27:36.86]Let's just do the exact same thing in GTA.
[27:41.72]Is it possible to die in this game?
[27:43.17]No, it's not.
[27:46.13]Alright, so hold on.
[27:46.85]Let me...
[27:50.24]That's fucking so funny.
[27:52.58]Why did I buy this?
[27:58.25]There is no reason to purchase this game.
[28:01.79]You guys wanna- like there's your joke.
[28:07.17]That's your funny joke right there guys.
[28:13.16]Ah, shit.
[28:15.42]Uh... Well, we're gonna have to do something else for a little while, because, um... Grand Theft Auto needs to be installed.
[28:26.01]What a good joke stream.
[28:27.69]I just... I don't know what I was thinking.
[28:29.87]I'm like, oh, you know, that may be funny to do, like, a fucking Driver's Edge stream.
[28:33.99]And the game was just Grand Theft Auto without the fun.
