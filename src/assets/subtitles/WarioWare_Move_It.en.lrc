[ve:60.16.100]

[00:13.08]Okay, so... Hi, everybody.
[00:16.10]I might sound a little different today.
[00:18.94]I'm currently on the wireless setup.
[00:23.08]Charged up.
[00:23.68]It's good to go.
[00:25.34]Maybe I sound a little... Maybe it doesn't sound that... Maybe it sounds alright.
[00:27.88]We'll see.
[00:32.26]I'm using the same things that I did for the green screen last year.
[00:36.93]So I'm fully wireless.
[00:41.85]Because today...
[00:44.28]We're playing WarioWare.
[00:45.62]Move out of the fucking way.
[00:49.10]I have to move around.
[00:50.10]I was going to do no cam and just sit in the chair, and then I looked up a little bit about this game, and it's like, you can't just sit down.
[01:00.43]Yeah.
[01:03.25]Yeah.
[01:10.03]He didn't know.
[01:10.75]I mean, I figured I could sit here in a chair and just be like, alright, let me just move my arms around really slowly.
[01:16.85]But no.
[01:17.21]Does it sound like you're doing a Ted Talk?
[01:22.39]No?
[01:22.59]Just pretend that's what this is.
[01:34.29]It also, let me change one quick thing with this.
[01:37.98]Actually, no, I think it's fine.
[01:43.10]I could probably turn it up a little, but I don't know if I really want to do that.
[01:53.86]Yeah, I'm officially back from DougDoug's stream.
[01:57.96]That was a lot of fun.
[01:58.64]If you didn't see it, I would go watch the VOD.
[02:01.70]You're gonna hear me burp and stuff, I'm just telling you.
[02:03.88]The microphone is in a perfect spot for you to hear the sounds going from my throat going into my mouth.
[02:09.11]Like, right there.
[02:09.71]I'm sorry.
[02:10.59]I can't do anything about that.
[02:12.54]There's no noise gate on this.
[02:14.54]So you're gonna hear every paper shuffling, you're gonna hear every time you hear like sound effects going out of my throat.
[02:31.01]Dug Dug event was great, yeah.
[02:32.93]So for those of you that don't know, I had to keep my mouth shut for that because we wanted it to be a surprise that I had really anything to do with being on camera.
[02:42.93]I told you guys before that, oh yeah, I was creative director for that show, and it was awesome to work with Doug Doug, but I couldn't tell you that I was gonna come out of the machine.
[02:55.83]Yeah, that was like a couple months of going back and forth with Doug through Off-Brand.
[03:00.66]It's the first show that I really had a lot to do with, and I thought it was really fun.
[03:07.74]Hopefully that translated well.
[03:10.78]Doug is a genius.
[03:13.68]Some of the stuff that he comes up with.
[03:15.81]All the coding and all.
[03:17.69]It was a pleasure.
[03:20.41]You spoiled it?
[03:21.29]No, I did not.
[03:31.78]Are you in a box right now?
[03:33.14]No.
[03:33.32]I got a different mic set up.
[03:36.08]Trust me, this will be better.
[03:37.08]Even if it sounds a little worse than usual.
[03:39.37]Because I can actually move around.
[03:45.69]Were you actually in there for four hours?
[03:47.61]Well, so I'll give you a little bit of backstage stuff.
[03:53.69]The shuffler, the face, I was in control of that.
[03:59.19]I was doing all the emotions.
[04:02.16]I had a box.
[04:03.18]Essentially, I had seven stream decks.
[04:05.86]They were like a hundred buttons.
[04:08.23]And I was puppeteering that while doing the voice and putting in sound.
[04:12.66]I recorded like 200 different audio tracks to put in 200 different buttons.
[04:18.18]And one of the off-brand production people came up to me, they were like, hey, this is great, but I don't think we can have more than 110 buttons.
[04:27.99]I don't think that's gonna work.
[04:31.25]So I was like, okay, well, whatever we can get.
[04:33.94]So like anytime you see the eyes moving, that was me.
[04:36.48]Anytime obviously it's talking, that was me.
[04:40.61]Which was, that was a lot of fun to do that.
[04:46.97]The shuffler was a silly goose, yeah.
[04:54.38]VTuber model.
[04:56.42]That's kind of funny because it was a lot of fun to do that.
[05:00.94]That kind of makes me want to do something like that just for fun.
[05:04.90]But who knows?
[05:05.34]I probably won't do it.
[05:06.24]But yeah, I hope everyone's doing good.
[05:10.56]It's good to be back.
[05:12.46]Good to be hanging out again.
[05:14.40]I do have something really cool to announce.
[05:18.68]A couple of things, actually.
[05:21.78]Next week, on November 24th, the Grotto Beasts Tabletop Simulator Edition is launching.
[05:33.66]Everybody get excited.
[05:36.48]24th.
[05:37.92]Tabletop Simulator, it's going out there.
[05:40.73]It is going to be available for free.
[05:43.49]Going to be lots of fun stuff to do in it.
[05:48.38]And my plan with Grotto Beasts, I'll give you kind of a little extra part of this plan too, is when this comes out,
[05:57.32]We're gonna put the store on sale.
[06:01.74]We're gonna do a little sale for like... Oh, like Black Friday into the end of the year.
[06:06.73]Because there's still some inventory left.
[06:09.07]There's not a lot of inventory left.
[06:12.17]But at the end of the year, that store is probably gonna come down.
[06:16.19]As we get really close to being out of inventory.
[06:21.25]So there'll be a little holiday sale.
[06:23.93]And then at the end of the year...
[06:25.61]We will pull it off of the website.
[06:29.52]But going forward for at least, I want to say, the tentative plan is six to 12 months.
[06:39.72]So at least six months.
[06:41.52]We're going to officially support the TTS version.
[06:45.33]So there'll be patches and updates and maybe seasonal stuff and maybe even new cards digitally.
[06:51.79]Just for fun.
[06:53.79]Just for free.
[07:07.50]Somebody just said, what the fuck are you talking about?
[07:09.58]Alright, well, dude, you had to have known what this... Alright, you can't just, like, come to the channel, like, three weeks ago.
[07:17.23]And I must be speaking a different language to this person.
[07:21.13]There's a... You know, it's a whole thing.
[07:24.23]Go look up Grotto Beasts.
[07:29.25]talking about?
[07:31.77]I guess if you don't know what I'm talking about, then you just don't know.
[07:43.49]Hey dude, are you streaming from the bottom of a Pringles can?
[07:46.67]Once you pop, the fun don't stop.
[07:52.38]Pringles.
[07:56.68]You'll see why in a second.
[07:57.69]I wasn't even going to do facecam, but I have to.
[08:00.51]I have to.
[08:03.45]It's the last time you're ever going to fucking see it, by the way.
[08:08.51]Alright, you guys ready?
[08:10.81]We're going to be playing WarioWare Move It.
[08:12.89]I do play every single WarioWare game.
[08:16.26]So I have to play this one.
[08:17.70]Can you hear it coming through the TV?
[08:18.86]Because I'm playing on TV.
[08:29.45]Hi everybody.
[08:30.75]See?
[08:32.31]Check this out.
[08:33.90]No wires.
[08:34.52]Hey, look at this.
[08:38.60]No wires.
[08:39.10]Isn't that unbelievable?
[08:43.70]Alright, so am I in a good spot?
[08:47.49]Make it bigger?
[08:48.91]No.
[08:50.03]You just have to relax.
[08:51.97]You get what you get.
[08:55.86]I love the tracksuit.
[09:01.00]I've been in comfy clothes.
[09:03.80]I'm not going to put a suit on to play.
[09:06.72]Guys, I was not even going to turn the facecam on.
[09:11.46]I'm not going to put a button up on to play WarioWare.
[09:15.32]I've got to be fit.
[09:16.20]I've got to be able to move.
[09:17.40]Look, it's in the title.
[09:19.28]You dummy.
[09:19.78]Alright, you ready?
[09:21.82]Can you hear it?
[09:25.42]I was told to make sure the straps are on.
[09:29.32]Yeah.
[09:31.93]How we doing?
[09:34.13]Story mode, right?
[09:36.91]Be sure to wear the Joy-Con straps.
[09:40.55]Left-handed players hold left.
[09:42.87]Right-handed players hold A. Well, I'm right-handed, so let's go.
[09:48.04]Be aware of your surrounding and allow... See?
[09:52.44]I'm ready.
[09:56.65]Somebody said, who let you stream from the restaurant?
[10:02.89]What is that implying?
[10:04.19]Wait, somebody help me here.
[10:05.52]The chat's down here.
[10:06.62]What does that mean?
[10:08.18]Why are you streaming from the restaurant?
[10:14.38]You look like a line cook.
[10:18.94]I have a black sweatshirt on.
[10:22.90]I'm not...
[10:25.49]What, sorry, so I dress like a stagehand today, okay?
[10:28.41]I dress like a puppeteer today?
[10:29.69]Is that the problem?
[10:33.73]The puppeteer.
[10:36.63]I've got like Kermit here.
[10:38.81]This is like one of those backstage photos of like Gonzo is on my arm and I'm like.
[10:42.78]Alright, you guys ready?
[10:47.70]Let's go.
[10:50.44]Grip the controllers with your thumbs.
[10:52.80]Wait, what is ZL?
[10:58.98]ZL plus ZR.
[11:04.56]With your thumbs?
[11:09.24]Oh, it's gonna go like that.
[11:11.89]Please use the grip hold while playing.
[11:14.19]So I have to hold these the whole time?
[11:15.67]Okay, the whole time.
[11:22.38]But it's already greasy.
[11:29.65]So I don't know anything about this game.
[11:31.08]All I know is that it got pretty mixed reviews.
[11:33.00]That's all I know.
[11:33.54]Okay.
[11:33.64]It got good reviews?
[12:02.50]Can I turn it up?
[12:03.00]Can anybody... Okay.
[12:04.81]If I start bleeding through the mic, yell at me.
[12:06.93]But, like, I want to turn it up a little.
[12:08.51]I've got a TV over here, okay?
[12:09.81]This is my new setup.
[12:12.31]Are we good?
[12:13.13]Can you hear it?
[12:15.01]It's too loud?
[12:16.78]It's not.
[12:17.00]It's fine.
[12:19.08]Alright, we're fine.
[12:19.98]We're fine.
[12:32.32]Turn yourself up.
[12:33.98]I actually can do that, and I'm kind of afraid to.
[12:36.30]Hold on, let me do it.
[12:42.84]Is that better?
[12:43.48]How's that?
[12:45.06]Is that better or is that worse?
[12:46.22]Am I peaking?
[12:46.86]Do you want me to do a few tests?
[12:48.04]Is that better?
[12:49.44]Let me see.
[12:50.96]One, two, three, four.
[12:51.75]Alright, this is choo-choo.
[12:57.42]Hold your form stone with your hand.
[12:58.80]I'm gonna 100% this whole game, by the way.
[13:01.10]In an hour.
[13:02.43]See you in 40 minutes.
[13:04.13]Alright, so just like this.
[13:04.83]I have to hold the buttons?
[13:05.57]Outrace.
[13:22.70]I'm lightning quick.
[13:25.16]That was easy.
[13:26.74]Let's go.
[14:03.04]I went too fast.
[14:04.40]Choo-choo.
[14:06.40]Clink.
[14:06.70]Ah, alright.
[14:11.12]He just walked towards you.
[14:13.64]Choo-choo.
[14:14.46]Do I have to hold the grips the whole time, or was that a lie?
[14:23.90]Hey.
[14:24.92]No?
[14:25.18]Okay.
[14:26.48]Here we go.
[14:27.28]Choo-choo.
[14:38.69]Did he say it every time?
[14:39.79]That's kind of annoying.
[14:42.35]What the... What?
[14:47.41]Does it creep forward?
[14:48.59]Oh, it's like red light, green light.
[14:50.51]Whatever.
[14:57.12]I like this so far.
[14:58.00]This is kind of like the Wii one.
[15:03.22]Choo-choo.
[15:09.19]Alright, what do I do?
[15:11.11]Whack.
[15:11.91]Whack what?
[15:23.72]You didn't tell me there was going to be a lightning lizard, whatever it is.
[15:27.14]Choo choo.
[15:33.23]It's an eel.
[15:34.23]Sorry.
[15:39.87]Say what it is right or I'm going to leave.
[15:41.51]Oh, just relax.
[15:50.22]Actually, don't.
[15:50.82]I can't lose right now.
[15:51.64]I'm going to lose the whole thing.
[16:08.19]Is that it?
[16:10.69]That was a fun tutorial.
[16:14.51]Turned with a chair.
[16:15.40]What?
[16:17.22]I just moved it out of the way.
[16:27.93]Move it into frame.
[16:30.17]It is in frame, isn't it?
[16:33.09]You know I'm gonna be sitting down for at least a few of these.
[16:34.65]This is perfect.
[16:36.17]Just go like this.
[16:39.51]Theater unlocked.
[16:41.77]You probably watch cutscenes, right?
[16:43.57]Oh, this is Mono.
[16:52.94]Museum.
[16:53.92]What's the museum?
[16:54.40]What is it?
[16:56.82]Different forms.
[17:00.54]Ah, you can just play them.
[17:03.41]Oh.
[17:10.95]fireside chat.
[17:13.31]So, when we decided to make WarioWare, let me tell you a few different things that happened.
[17:18.54]I had a dream.
[17:19.62]I had a dream that all these games were, you know, happening at the same time.
[17:25.02]Wait, I didn't want to press A. This all came to me in a nightmare, actually.
[17:31.56]Yeah, the entire franchise actually came to me when I was really sick.
[17:35.57]I had a really bad fever.
[17:37.70]and I was just constantly sneezing, and I woke myself up.
[17:42.55]I just wanted to move my arms really fast.
[17:45.81]Why am I doing this one?
[17:52.05]Dude, can you imagine the drugs that must have been taken when they thought of this?
[17:58.65]No, maybe they just wanted to have fun for a little while.
[18:02.86]Everybody has to say that, right?
[18:04.28]I don't want to do this anymore.
[18:07.11]Aw, dude, I bet you they were so fucked up.
[18:09.69]No, they probably weren't.
[18:12.25]Stop being weird about it.
[18:16.11]Alright, that's cool.
[18:17.01]We're going up like this?
[18:27.10]I gotta make sure I don't go too high, because my stomach's gonna come out.
[18:29.60]It's really hard to hold this in.
[18:31.82]What you guys don't know is my pants are up over my belly button with this thing on me to like keep it tight because it'll just fall out.
[18:38.71]It'll just be like a huge, gross stomach.
[18:41.76]Are you drunk?
[18:47.98]No.
[18:48.50]Are you?
[19:01.69]does this game have the thing where you it's like a hundred times speed and you can't lose once what's the book on the chair that's a mouse pad that's by the way if you're wondering that's the setup I sit there I got my it's the mouse pad is connected to a thing and I can sit there I got the keyboard on the lap and I got this big screen over here it is the new meta
[19:29.92]Sitting at a desk upright with a bunch of shit all over you and a bunch of, like, you're just confined.
[19:34.40]No.
[19:35.54]Just watch.
[19:37.26]That's not ergonomic.
[19:39.00]That's not right.
[19:39.74]That's an ancient mage setup.
[19:42.61]Why?
[19:57.79]This is not an ancient mage chair.
[20:01.61]In fact, this chair looks like there's somebody in it that's gonna come out and grab me as a joke halfway through the stream.
[20:07.77]So, I don't know if I agree with you.
[20:20.84]Like, this thing's gonna stand up and the arms are gonna grab me around my waist.
[20:25.44]The voice from above speaks.
[20:27.39]Right hand over left hand?
[20:28.33]Perform a grip hold with your hands stacked atop one another.
[20:33.03]Your dominant hand should be on top.
[20:37.21]Got it.
[20:38.31]The voice saw its people were defenseless, so it gave them a sword.
[20:43.59]After a few mishaps, it also gave them this form, so they knew not to hold the pointy end.
[20:54.38]OK.
[20:58.76]Oops.
[21:01.00]Oh, this game's kinda hard.
[21:07.89]I almost didn't break that one.
[21:29.62]That's a lot of pepper.
[21:30.58]Is that too much?
[21:32.61]Was it too much?
[21:33.21]What was it?
[21:33.61]What was the problem?
[21:34.31]Too slow?
[21:59.21]I can't stop laughing.
[22:00.21]Why?
[22:00.47]I didn't even do anything!
[22:03.15]I didn't do anything!
[22:28.96]Stop.
[22:29.36]Don't turn it.
[22:31.16]I can't help it.
[22:32.26]Did I do it?
[22:32.88]Oh, I'm connected here.
[22:33.60]Got it.
[22:58.10]Alright, boss stage.
[23:00.96]I'm gonna get tired really quick.
[23:08.37]What's that?
[23:09.11]Oh shit.
[23:34.28]What the fuck?
[23:36.90]Did I lose?
[23:37.34]No, we're good.
[23:46.02]Jesus!
[23:46.52]I got him.
[23:58.38]He looks senile.
[24:00.58]That was great.
[24:02.63]If you played this game, you would be doing the same thing I'm doing.
[24:07.96]Oops!
[24:09.18]Got the straps on.
[24:10.02]Put those on, kids.
[24:20.74]So what do you think I should do with the hair?
[24:23.27]I was trying to figure this out.
[24:29.11]Do I shape it?
[24:29.85]Do I cut it?
[24:32.07]Did I put it up in a bun?
[24:33.01]Alright, will you guys allow me, and I'm not asking permission, because it's my hair, I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it, but would you guys be okay with me doing a man bun for one day?
[24:46.81]Did I break this?
[24:53.45]Alright, where do we go?
[24:57.20]Ashley, Krygor, or Orbulon?
[25:06.14]I'm not doing that.
[25:07.04]We'll go right in the middle.
[25:16.04]I don't think I can even do a man bun.
[25:18.56]It's long back here and not long enough on the top.
[25:22.07]I need to grow it out and cut it.
[25:29.33]Or should I just do a bunch of gel and go straight up?
[25:32.66]Like Guile.
[25:34.08]And just try to keep a straight face for at least 10 minutes.
[25:36.30]Did you say I peaked?
[25:37.42]Did my mic peak?
[25:38.78]Hopefully it didn't.
[25:41.28]Do straight up do Guile?
[25:58.71]You should braid it.
[25:59.75]86% said yes to a man bun.
[26:02.33]That was way more than I thought it was going to be.
[26:07.55]I was convinced it was going to be like 30%.
[26:28.88]Alright, let's go.
[26:30.32]Shall we begin?
[26:31.10]So no new techniques?
[26:35.88]Massage.
[26:38.91]The voice from above speaks.
[26:42.07]Perform a grip hold with both hands held straight out in front of you.
[26:47.08]Your palms should be facing down.
[26:49.12]You do two pigtails.
[26:51.79]The voice used this form to care for those who built his temple.
[26:55.93]Absolutely no.
[26:56.79]The worker's exhaustion was magically lifted.
[26:59.34]Absolutely not.
[27:00.40]As a result, the voice could work them even harder.
[27:03.86]And the job was done in three days.
[27:06.96]No.
[27:07.16]No.
[27:07.95]No, that's not happening.
[27:11.37]I felt like that last minute.
[27:23.84]More?
[27:24.40]Big cheese.
[27:27.36]The voice from above speaks.
[27:30.46]Perform a grip hold with the palms of your hands to your hips.
[27:34.01]Like this?
[27:34.59]Thumbs forward.
[27:36.17]Then puff out your chest.
[27:38.09]Should do a mohawk.
[27:41.95]This was a form initially reserved for royals.
[27:45.09]No, so not like this, so flat.
[27:48.43]It spread quickly amongst the people, and as such, they're all a little cheesy.
[27:54.26]What is this stance you're doing?
[27:55.44]I'm just matching the tutorial.
[27:59.84]Big cheese.
[28:01.94]Jump.
[28:05.90]Oh, I had to go more than once.
[28:06.70]I'm sorry if that's going to pick up when I jump.
[28:09.79]Massage.
[28:15.68]Does this sound okay, though?
[28:16.90]Because I haven't used this in like a year and a half.
[28:18.76]It's been like two years.
[28:20.10]Does it actually sound okay?
[28:21.08]Is it picking up a bunch of bullshit?
[28:22.42]Cool.
[28:22.52]Alright.
[28:38.38]When this glyph appears, be ready to drop your force.
[28:42.28]I'm gonna forget all of these in 10 minutes.
[28:43.70]Ensure the strap is attached and muster the courage to let go.
[28:47.86]Just want him?
[28:51.05]But be sure you see the glyph first.
[28:54.31]If the voice has not revealed one, then never drop your force.
[28:58.57]I'm so glad that I, yeah.
[29:01.93]I was gonna sit there with no cam and no scraps.
[29:05.41]Massage.
[29:06.69]At that point, don't even play.
[29:13.38]What?
[29:14.83]What happened?
[29:15.23]I didn't do anything!
[29:17.95]What did I do wrong?
[29:18.51]Oh!
[29:18.57]I was going to give it to the wrong person.
[29:29.76]Good thing I screwed that up.

[31:17.56]I had so much time left.
[31:19.40]I want a sword wound where I can go.
[31:51.76]I can hear your bones cracking when you move.
[31:54.94]Yeah?
[31:59.52]Yeah.
[32:00.10]Ouch!
[32:05.80]Yeah, that is... Hey.
[32:07.58]Hey.
[32:10.26]Come talk to me when you're 40.
[32:14.68]I'm not kidding.
[32:15.54]That is real shit.
[32:18.50]Let's go.
[32:34.72]You can definitely hear that.
[32:35.83]That's so funny.
[32:37.05]I don't have a noise game.
[32:40.75]Remind me to mute this when I go piss in like 40 minutes.
[32:44.11]Because I will forget.
[32:57.65]Yeah, you're going to hear like three or four acid reflux pizza burps and a full stream piss into the toilet if I'm not careful.
[33:04.48]You're going to hear one of those like... With a full stream.
[33:23.36]Hey Red, eat this.
[33:25.04]It should help.
[33:26.75]Let's freaking go.
[33:34.66]Bro, please.
[33:38.60]I'm doing just fine.
[33:45.79]Okay, let's just do it.
[33:47.34]Do it like the fucking drunk uncle at the wedding.
[33:49.32]The voice from above speaks.
[33:52.14]Perform a grip hold with both arms outstretched to the sides.
[33:57.38]Your thumbs must be on top.
[34:01.96]The tilt of your body reflects the imbalance in your heart.
[34:06.48]In order to master the scales form, one must empty one's pockets.
[34:11.83]The smallest piece of lint can lead to disaster.
[34:21.45]Alright.
[34:23.13]Bring it on.
[34:23.67]This is heavy.
[34:24.17]Did I get it wrong?
[34:24.97]Oh, I was like, holy shit, I got it wrong.
[34:28.52]Look at that.
[34:28.88]Look at this.
[34:29.40]Hey, what's up dude?
[34:50.85]One, two, three, pull.
[34:54.90]The voice taught that everyone must pull their weight.
[34:58.78]Failure to do so would be over the line.
[35:06.38]Okay.
[35:08.53]Tug of war.
[35:10.77]Fly.
[35:14.83]Easy.
[35:18.67]Scales.
[35:20.69]Grab and pull.
[35:28.28]Turn the screen off.
[35:29.24]Catch.
[35:29.48]Quiet.
[35:29.80]Acceptable.
[35:30.70]Scales.
[35:31.20]Match the time.
[35:31.86]Watch out.
[35:51.38]You actually did it, yeah.
[35:54.00]I know how to tell an animal how to talk.
[35:55.68]Wait, soak up what?
[35:58.10]I wasn't paying attention.
[35:59.00]That's your fault I was looking over here.
[36:01.16]Oh my goodness, that one was hard.
[36:03.80]What?
[36:21.41]I thought I would let... Wait, I'm... What'd I do?
[36:23.82]Celebrate the star.
[36:26.66]Okay.
[36:28.26]Not bad.
[36:29.06]Yeah, I... I was supposed to stop the sheep or let... It was like, only people are allowed in?
[36:32.98]I don't know.
[36:37.07]Too bad.
[36:37.69]It's alright.
[36:38.15]You gotta fill one.
[36:39.81]You gotta... Oh shit, somebody's coming out of there!
[36:49.31]Do the sacred pose.
[37:02.86]Let's... Come on.
[37:03.62]There we go.
[37:07.28]That's better.
[37:09.64]Oh, that sucked.
[37:13.35]Oh.
[37:32.48]Holy shit, that was close.
[37:33.54]Ah!
[37:33.62]Uh oh.
[38:11.41]Oh shit.
[38:16.99]Why am I not going this way?
[38:18.33]I feel like I'm at like a corporate team building exercise.
[38:42.46]Alright, we're good.
[38:48.15]Not bad.
[38:49.85]Didn't see that coming.
[38:51.19]That's cracking, dude.
[38:54.25]That's bad.
[38:55.47]Bro is crumbling.
[39:12.03]Look at this.
[39:12.83]What the fuck?
[39:13.49]This thing's making a weird noise.
[39:21.91]I'm hearing a weird sound back here.
[39:38.60]He turned the old Jerma into a chair.
[39:42.12]Want me to eat your hair?
[40:05.88]You need to fucking relax.
[40:07.56]Take a second.
[40:08.94]I want you to sit down.
[40:09.62]I want you to take a few deep breaths and just think about what you just said.
[40:14.40]Just think about it for a minute.
[40:15.64]I just need you to take a minute to relax.
[40:18.59]And then I need you to come back and be like, alright, I'm fucking, I'm back now.
[40:46.81]Your hair looks like taffy, though.
[40:53.69]I feel like you guys just have a thesaurus up when the stream is going.
[40:59.00]He's just like, alright, I gotta think of things that his hair could look like.
[41:04.04]Stringy.
[41:04.52]Okay, it's like stringy.
[41:06.04]Taffy.
[41:07.32]Spaghetti.
[41:08.06]You guys just have a thesaurus going.
[41:09.12]Your thumbs must be at your nose and rear, with the form stones parallel to the ground.
[41:18.39]Feathers lookin' slinkin' wind blowin' back my comb.
[41:21.11]Pluckin' round the island cause that's all I've ever known.

[41:47.56]The voice from above speaks.
[41:50.58]Open both hands.
[41:52.38]Then place your form stones in them.
[41:56.67]I wonder if you can hear that.
[41:57.49]The rocks are cute in the hands.
[41:59.25]I'm jumbling around on my insides.
[42:00.69]They're making noise now.
[42:01.57]But remember this.
[42:03.81]You too are like a small pet to the voice.

[42:13.44]Gift giver.
[42:19.47]I did it.
[42:26.03]Lifter.
[42:29.03]The voice from above speaks.
[42:32.09]Perform a grip hold with both arms held vertically in front of you.
[42:36.95]Your palms should face your head.
[42:41.26]This form captures the strength of a mighty warrior.
[42:45.44]The voice had intended for the Maudels to be a loner.
[42:49.02]But they worked so well.
[42:51.16]Oh, boom, boom.
[42:51.64]And they hit the ground.
[42:52.46]To ask for them back.
[42:57.21]I hope that was enough.
[42:59.51]Lift her.
[43:01.61]Block.
[43:09.89]OK.

[44:35.69]That was awkward.
[44:43.77]Oh my goodness.
[44:46.12]That was kinda unfair.
[44:46.96]I didn't even, I didn't even, ooh.
[44:49.96]This one's very sensitive.
[45:00.88]Um, wait, uh, two?
[45:02.10]Um, three.
[45:07.23]Oh, I get it, I get it.
[45:08.37]Two.
[45:11.35]Three.
[45:11.99]No!
[45:12.29]I thought that was three!
[45:14.92]They threw a four in there.
[45:16.34]There wasn't a four before.
[45:17.84]I thought that was a... I just assumed it was a three.
[45:19.96]Lifter.
[45:29.71]Goal.
[45:31.21]Okay, let's go one.

[45:59.18]What?
[45:59.44]What's going on?
[45:59.90]Oh, that.
[46:00.32]I almost accidentally let this one down.
[47:03.16]I look like Anakin Skywalker.
[47:05.67]If I had a black cape on and went like... You know how badly I've wanted to walk and just have a... Come out to the side.
[47:25.44]Ooh, remix already.
[47:27.93]I guess it's remix one.
[47:31.83]Alright, this is where the real test is.
[47:35.39]That whole thing was... The last hour was a tutorial.
[47:44.30]I'm not going to do that joke again.
[47:47.02]There, I did it.
[48:05.85]Stop looking so bored.
[48:09.79]I'm just playing, man.
[48:14.03]I'm just taking a break.
[48:24.96]Pay attention.
[48:26.96]They're on a bus and they're going to a concert.
[48:32.78]Wario's band is playing.
[48:36.71]Alright, I guess I'll... Ugh!
[48:39.03]Eyes on the road!
[48:40.35]Oh wait, none of them are driving.
[48:50.08]What am I talking about?
[49:13.53]The guy has my exact body type.
[49:27.12]I was just cursed with small legs.
[49:28.35]I have a huge torso.
[49:34.13]If my legs were even a little longer, I'd be like six feet tall.
[49:48.62]Yeah, that's how that works, man, with an Omega Lull.
[49:52.74]Big cheese.
[49:54.68]Hand out.
[49:56.32]No!
[49:57.04]Inconceivable.
[50:02.05]Scales.
[50:04.05]Soak up light.
[50:07.37]God damn it, that one's hard.
[50:08.35]Pretty good.
[50:08.69]Because you have to tilt different directions.
[50:11.17]Gift giver.
[50:13.15]Get candy.
[50:20.48]Scales.
[50:22.43]Humans only.
[50:23.39]Alright, so you can come in.
[50:25.35]You can come in.
[50:26.87]But you cannot come in.
[50:29.09]I get it.
[50:30.53]Correct.
[50:32.67]Dude, your legs shrank in the wash.
[50:35.35]Feet.
[50:36.97]Shit.
[50:39.86]Excellent.
[50:42.40]Can you keep up?
[50:45.66]Massage.
[50:47.44]Swim.
[50:50.92]These things are sensitive.
[50:52.04]I just went crazy.
[50:52.86]Yep.
[50:52.94]What the fuck?
[51:21.22]Oh, hey everybody.
[51:33.39]Did you see what he just did?
[51:35.55]I can't believe what he did.
[51:37.17]I think we should clip it and watch it and laugh.
[51:39.23]Did you see what it looked like he was doing to his penis?
[51:42.15]1, 2, 3, 4.
[51:49.90]one two three four five one two three four five one two one two play the pose
[52:16.25]This one I feel like could get really hard if it levels up to be harder after this.
[52:19.75]Especially if there's more than three.
[52:24.19]Wait, what?
[52:25.27]Got it.
[52:48.28]Oh, is it wrong?
[52:49.30]Yep, I got it.
[52:52.72]Look at all the gold I get.
[52:53.66]Hey, those of you that work out, remember these?
[53:07.11]Remember these with the bar?
[53:08.95]This way?
[53:09.91]Oh!
[53:10.33]You remember these?
[53:11.71]Right here.
[53:12.45]Right there.

[53:16.85]Up like that.
[53:18.03]Down.
[53:18.71]With the bar, with the weights.
[53:20.05]Right there.
[53:20.47]Reverse curls for your forearms.
[53:32.41]Actually, that's one of my favorite exercises.
[53:35.18]You do it with really light weight.
[53:36.66]Don't do it with anything heavy.
[53:38.44]But, just the way it feels.
[53:40.66]You gotta get the good form, too.
[53:41.98]Because these are sensitive muscles here.
[53:44.83]Like this.
[53:45.17]Keep your arms straight down like that.
[53:47.27]Up like this.
[53:47.99]Curl.
[53:48.72]Hold it for a sec.
[53:49.76]Straight down.
[53:50.26]Don't go too fast.
[53:52.64]You'll feel a massive burn in here.
[53:56.14]That's how you get this muscle to, like, slam!
[53:58.71]Beat the fucking people at arm wrestling.
[54:15.20]Yeah, you still have a dad bod.
[54:17.34]I haven't worked out in six years, seven years.
[54:20.79]I kind of can't.
[54:22.19]This hurts too much.
[54:24.59]To be real.
[54:26.19]I hate to get real.
[54:31.87]New pose coming in.
[54:35.22]The voice from above speaks.
[54:37.88]What is this?
[54:38.75]Let go of the left form stone.
[54:41.53]Hold the right form stone in your left hand.
[54:45.05]Capture your right hand in the gesture window.
[54:47.71]How are you supposed to do this reliably?
[54:50.13]Should be on the bottom.
[54:53.66]Huh?
[54:55.36]Feeling useless and adrift, the left form stone stood awkwardly by.
[55:01.64]Eventually, the island.
[55:03.18]I think I got it right.
[55:03.88]This is right, isn't it?
[55:11.02]Bro, what is going on?

[60:57.07]It's like dad in the chair, like you did something wrong.
[61:02.32]Hey, son.
[61:08.90]Come on in here.
[61:12.89]So, uh, your mother tells me that she found a pack of cigarettes in the sock drawer.
[61:20.37]Don't be like me.
[61:28.33]There's so many poses.
[61:31.59]I learned it from you.
[61:58.69]He's secretly proud.
[62:00.35]Why did I get up?
[62:04.77]There's more cutscene to watch.
[62:06.39]I am weirdly in the corner.
[62:11.27]This is a very strange view.
[62:16.66]Where did the snow come from?
[62:20.02]You're lazy?
[62:20.84]Yeah.
[62:23.12]This is pretty cool to me.
[62:27.20]I want you guys to understand that this is not the way that I'm normally going to be streaming.
[62:33.02]I'm going to have keyboard here, mouse here, like this.
[62:36.57]Looking this way.
[62:37.15]And I got a monitor over here.
[62:41.03]Just know that that's exactly how I'm sitting.
[62:46.11]Just like this.
[62:50.57]It's going to be awesome.
[62:53.83]Let the battle begin.
[62:59.46]Squat.
[63:01.12]Like this?
[63:02.44]The voice from above speaks.
[63:05.68]Perform a grip hold with your palms at your thighs.
[63:09.71]Spread your legs and lower your hips.
[63:12.77]Keep your hands on your thighs without letting go.
[63:15.47]It's OK.
[63:18.93]Sometimes a beer is nice, but...
[63:39.10]I'm not a huge alcohol drinker.
[63:42.72]Sometimes I do.
[63:43.56]If it's a fun thing or an event or something that's cool to do.
[63:47.10]But I don't really drink on a regular basis at all.
[63:54.03]Crocodile.
[63:57.07]The voice from above speaks.
[64:00.15]Perform a grip hold with palms together and arms held straight out.
[64:05.89]You love wine?
[64:06.39]Wine is, yeah, I love wine.
[64:07.81]Wine's good.
[64:09.09]Just don't drink it every day.
[64:11.37]Your hands should rest lightly atop each other.
[64:13.95]Just like that.
[64:14.93]We do this out of solidarity with the island crocodiles, which have unusually weak jaws.
[64:23.74]I like, if I do drink, it's vodka.
[64:25.96]I like vodka, pineapple, vodka, cranberry.
[64:27.84]Crocodile.
[64:30.21]Just easy.
[64:34.09]Not a bunch of bullshit.
[64:36.15]Just vodka pineapple.
[64:37.77]Down to life.
[64:42.77]I did it!
[64:43.38]No, I just put it down!
[64:44.26]Alright, I like that one.
[64:55.70]That was fun.
[65:01.92]Squat.
[65:03.92]Draw.
[65:07.73]What?
[65:08.85]You're on fire.
[65:10.21]What did I draw?
[65:11.15]What?
[65:11.43]Don't fall behind.
[65:15.11]Squat.
[65:16.97]Squeeze.
[65:23.62]Crocodile.
[65:25.46]Don't touch.
[65:34.09]That was weird.
[65:36.01]Let's do it real quick.
[66:06.39]Did I get it?
[66:06.91]Come on.
[66:07.88]Do the sacred pose.
[66:43.49]Squatting hard, old man.
[66:47.81]Kind of.
[66:48.59]Squat.
[66:57.28]Good technique.
[66:59.70]Crocodile.
[67:04.31]Alright, what is this one?
[67:07.89]What?
[67:09.45]Cut out the gold?
[68:17.49]What?
[68:19.25]Oh, I thought I had to go up there.
[68:22.15]I thought I had to go up.
[68:24.55]Oh, shit.
[68:24.99]That one's going to hurt.
[68:35.74]Oh, this... Okay.
[68:41.37]I get it.
[68:52.51]That was way easier than I was making it.
[68:56.35]I thought I had to individually get him.
[68:59.05]Like a dentist or something.
[69:06.45]Hey son.
[69:07.17]Your mother tells me that you want to start playing the tuba.
[69:14.59]You know your dad was a trombone player.
[69:16.95]Don't feel like playing that one?
[69:21.38]Got the old trombone in the closet over there, son.
[69:24.82]But you're a tuba player.
[69:27.89]Okay.
[69:28.33]No, that's fine.
[69:29.65]That's good.
[69:34.73]You know, your grandfather was also a trombone player, too.
[69:53.70]Oh, nice.
[69:56.22]Did you see this?
[69:59.82]Nobody can even see this.
[70:01.36]Got it over here, it's cool.
[70:11.27]Right itself, yeah, it's back.
[70:22.87]Needs a little bit of organization, but it's there.
[70:33.90]Okay.
[70:38.03]New pose.
[70:42.02]The voice from above speaks.
[70:44.64]Oh, God.
[70:45.08]Place the form stones on a flat surface.
[70:47.00]On the ground?
[70:48.28]You don't need to crouch.
[70:50.42]The front side should face up.
[70:51.82]This is not... I have to do this on the ground.
[70:53.16]Do not remove the straps.
[70:55.40]What if I do it here?
[70:57.14]See the form stones enjoying a respite from human hands.
[71:00.78]This works, I think.
[71:02.08]Little do they know that the silent calm is about to be broken by the people's revels.
[71:11.36]It's not going to be moving too much, right?
[71:13.64]Pounce.
[71:15.78]Look closely.
[71:21.29]Which one?
[71:23.89]Forget it.
[71:24.33]Okay.
[71:24.81]Alright.
[71:30.32]Archer.
[71:33.26]The voice from above speaks.
[71:36.52]Perform a grip hold with your dominant hand's palm on your chest.
[71:41.01]Couple of hits.
[71:41.71]Hold the other arm straight out.
[71:43.53]Three hits in a row.
[71:44.53]Turn your chest to the side as if you're drawing a bowstring.
[71:50.01]Nice.
[71:51.59]Father, the hunt went so well today.
[71:54.73]Yes, it's lucky for us that we've practiced the archer form.
[72:00.08]Parent and child return to their home as the sky.
[72:04.19]+2 for the last one.
[72:05.95]Sunset forms.
[72:09.57]Appreciate that.
[72:10.21]Thank you.
[72:13.17]Archer.
[72:15.32]Sink.
[72:20.02]Real cool.
[72:25.66]Love struck.
[72:28.64]The voice from above speaks.
[72:31.78]Perform a grip.
[72:33.20]There's a lot more poses in this than there were in the Wii one, isn't there?
[72:37.46]This is like number 12.
[72:38.56]This is like number 15 or so.
[72:40.25]Maybe there were.
[72:41.59]Maybe I'm not remembering right.
[72:46.91]The voice fell deeply in love, resulting in the dawn of this form.
[72:53.29]It turned out to be more of a short-lived crush, but the name stuck.
[73:00.67]Okay, so like this.
[73:03.80]Archer.
[73:06.66]I know how to do that.
[73:19.83]Just did that.
[73:20.77]Tennis Mania champion.
[73:30.63]That's good.
[73:33.45]Keep up, man.
[73:36.93]Lovester.
[73:38.73]Face the ghost.
[73:40.97]Gotcha.
[73:42.43]Got you.
[73:42.95]Oh, yeah.
[73:45.59]Archer.
[73:47.34]Catch the bird.
[73:48.58]Mm-hmm.
[73:52.34]So far, so good.
[73:53.94]Lovester.
[73:55.82]Fit your face.
[74:00.11]I don't talk about hair like that.
[74:02.57]Oh, shit.
[74:06.71]I don't get it.
[74:07.13]What does a woman do?
[74:07.74]I don't get it.
[74:11.04]I don't know what sword, what?
[74:14.28]Archer.
[74:17.48]Love strike.
[74:27.76]You got this.
[74:30.30]Archer.
[74:31.75]Punch.
[74:35.91]I like it.
[74:38.19]Glovestruck.
[74:39.93]Kiss the frog.
[74:41.79]He's over there.
[74:44.08]What the fuck?
[74:46.20]Pounce.
[74:51.84]Match.
[74:52.68]Got it.
[74:53.58]Easy does it.
[74:56.12]Stay smooth.
[75:11.12]Not done yet.
[75:11.81]Oh, I have to cook it.
[75:18.81]I think my pants are falling down.
[75:23.26]How do I... I want to serve it!
[75:24.62]Flip it.
[75:26.28]Oh.
[75:34.09]How do I flip it?
[75:40.29]Oh, God.
[75:42.03]No.
[76:03.44]This thing is dead.
[76:04.30]This thing's out of battery.
[76:11.53]Dude, this thing doesn't work.
[76:33.27]I'm going to do it on the ground.
[76:36.59]I lost my mojo.
[76:40.15]That one was stupid.
[76:44.46]Oh, not my Wellington.
[76:48.58]Do the sacred pose.
[77:01.07]No, you just suck.
[77:02.45]Hey, I... You don't know what you're talking about.
[77:17.83]Not done yet.
[77:18.49]I think it's because the couch is moving a little.
[77:26.03]That's definitely what was going on.
[77:30.72]Even the tiny little bit of movement.
[77:33.64]Lift.
[77:34.16]Plate it.
[77:34.90]Cook them all.
[77:36.06]That one's done.
[78:02.83]Cute.
[78:44.08]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[78:45.94]Alright, let's never do this one ever again.
[78:51.70]Alright, let's never do that one again.
[79:08.82]Medium rare?
[79:11.08]You're doing it wrong?
[79:11.96]How?
[79:14.55]You need to follow the instructions.
[79:18.85]I just crumpled those up and threw them behind me.
[79:21.03]Who fucking needs those?
[79:32.84]Very quick, I just beat it.
[79:39.36]Alright, did I unlock anything else?
[79:42.14]Or did we just kind of keep going?
[79:44.28]These are just cutscenes.
[79:52.14]What is this game?
[79:52.74]WarioWare.
[79:53.34]It's like one of the best Nintendo franchises.
[80:03.37]I am really far away.
[80:05.27]This is usually like four or five feet forward, but I moved it back just so I could stay in the middle.
[80:18.51]What is a Wario?
[80:19.77]Um, there's a guy up there.
[80:22.87]The game's loud now?
[80:25.08]Uh, is it?
[80:48.92]Yeah.
[80:49.32]Is that better?
[80:54.09]Yeah.
[80:54.61]Another one.
[80:55.25]Doesn't matter which one.
[81:00.17]A?
[81:00.23]Oh, it's going to be.
[81:01.25]I get it.
[81:18.22]Nice track pants.
[81:18.80]These are actually some of the most comfortable pants I own.
[81:20.76]These are so comfortable.
[81:21.98]Oh, fuck the world.
[81:30.17]I guess I got that wrong.
[81:31.57]Pounce.
[81:31.85]Plug leaks.
[81:59.90]One, two, three, one.
[82:01.99]That's it?
[82:03.73]Yeah, okay.
[82:07.03]When are we gonna do the skiing one?
[82:20.39]I like that one a lot.
[82:23.38]I did it.
[82:49.64]Detonate?
[83:20.27]Oh, I just barely got it.
[83:21.25]Alright.
[83:23.47]Oh no.
[83:56.79]I got it.
[83:59.61]Massage.
[84:31.95]Up his nose.
[84:32.35]Up his nose.
[84:33.70]Did I do it?
[84:34.48]Yeah.
[84:38.82]Can you make that noise for us?
[84:42.70]I doubt it.
[84:43.22]I kind of like this being able to sit down at a cutscene.
[85:19.59]Do you normally stand up for cutscenes?
[85:22.94]Oh, guys, alright, here comes a hit by playing Fat Man, Arkham City.
[85:25.32]Alright, here comes the part with the Joker.
[85:30.69]That was interesting.
[85:31.69]Alright, well, that's over.
[85:34.17]Sit down again.
[85:35.69]Do you really sit down?
[85:37.76]That's so stupid.
[85:39.92]Ooh, there's going to be Nintendo stuff here.
[85:42.22]You guys ready?
[85:42.58]There's going to be Super Mario 1-1.
[85:50.66]I'm going to have to jump.
[85:52.23]There's going to be... Star Fox.
[86:01.22]There's going to be.
[86:02.04]Link.
[86:02.32]Oh, yeah.
[86:03.95]Oh, yeah.
[86:32.60]Why am I watching this like a movie critic?
[86:40.08]I'm gonna watch that movie.
[86:49.54]Eventually.
[86:50.62]I said, it sucks.
[87:00.35]I know, we talked about this last week.
[87:08.38]Eat a sandwich, you string bean.
[87:10.40]Shut up.
[87:12.48]I'm like 158 pounds as a 5'7 man.
[87:13.68]Get out of here.
[87:15.26]Eat a sandwich, string bean.
[87:20.69]You don't know what I look like naked, okay?
[87:23.27]It's not pretty.
[87:24.19]It looks great, actually.
[87:25.15]Fuck off.
[87:28.35]What'd I do?
[87:32.81]Don't get caught.

[90:50.57]Oh, 20.
[90:50.67]21 seconds.
[90:51.33]The game is quiet now?
[91:12.93]Goldilocks sat in the first bed and it was too quiet.
[91:16.21]Goldilocks sat in the next bed and it was too loud.
[91:19.70]Goldilocks was then told by the owner of the home.
[91:25.02]I don't give a shit anymore.
[91:27.08]No more porridge.
[91:32.79]I'll cut it.
[91:40.51]Oh, remix two, let's go.

[91:52.78]Who knows?
[91:54.04]I unfollowed him a long time ago.
[91:57.08]I check in every now and again to see what he's up to, and it just annoys me every time, so I just leave.
[92:02.17]Maybe if we all pull together.
[92:03.83]I'm on it!
[92:05.13]And pull!
[92:07.83]And pull!
[92:09.03]Please stop!

[92:32.70]Let's go.
[93:01.95]That's the wall.
[93:03.41]I didn't know I could even do that.
[93:15.50]Holy crap.
[93:40.71]Nobody can do that and look cool doing it.
[93:42.40]I'm sorry.

[94:01.43]Faster.
[94:02.41]That probably looked really bad.
[94:06.27]I'm sorry.
[94:07.52]Face the ghost.

[94:43.37]Fashionista.
[94:44.17]Spin and toss.
[94:49.35]Your guard was down.
[94:50.95]Archer.
[94:53.95]Watch the bird.
[94:58.03]It's not my fault he's not looking where he's going.

[95:13.66]Fashionista.
[95:14.44]Find the cat.
[95:17.76]We gotta do that again.
[95:19.04]Nothing moved.
[95:19.94]I didn't see anything.
[95:21.87]Did something move?
[95:22.57]I didn't see anything move.
[95:23.43]Nothing moved.
[95:25.07]What moved?
[95:27.28]You didn't even try?
[95:28.02]I didn't see anything move.
[95:29.26]Do the sacred pose.
[95:31.86]You don't have to do anything with your leg.
[95:33.62]There's no tracker on the leg.
[95:34.76]You need to listen for the... The battle continues.
[95:44.27]Fashionista.
[95:45.77]Find the cat.
[95:52.23]There's no cat there.

[170:38.40]It's alright, I got 12.
[170:41.98]I don't care.
[170:48.42]There it is.
[170:50.78]Dirty job.
[170:53.29]What's a dirty job?
[170:56.57]Dirty job.
[170:57.31]Okay.
[170:58.05]Can you clear all five?
[170:59.57]Okay.
[171:10.68]Press the button with your index finger to shoot water.
[171:13.18]Okay.
[171:16.18]Oh, rapid fire.
[171:17.14]So it's these two.
[171:17.88]You can charge by bringing your hands together without pressing a button.
[171:22.54]When you're fully charged, you can fire a piercing water wipe.
[171:27.54]If the mono-circuit's alignment drifts, adopt the scales form and press ZR to reset.
[171:34.98]Okay.
[171:36.08]So you just go... Got it.
[171:39.24]Alright, let's try it.
[171:41.90]It's like a wave shooter?
[171:49.18]Ooh!
[172:51.91]I got it, I got it, get off the screen.
[173:00.18]Boss time, alright, let's go.
[173:37.74]Let's go!
[173:38.52]Let's go!
[173:52.39]Stage 2.
[173:52.67]This is fun.
[174:04.27]It's kind of more in the wrist than anything else.
[174:32.28]Yikes.
[174:39.58]Uh-oh.
[174:42.34]Uh-oh.
[174:43.06]Uh-oh!
[174:48.11]Come on!
[174:48.77]No!
[174:50.57]It's yucky.
[174:51.89]It's just yucky.
[174:53.77]Come on.
[174:54.33]Okay, come on.
[174:57.37]Okay.
[174:58.77]Okay, that's just...

[175:56.51]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[176:00.17]Ho-ho-ho-ho!
[176:08.15]How many levels are there?
[176:24.46]I'm just gonna keep them together.
[176:25.40]It feels better somehow than doing the charge.
[176:37.92]I'm not getting the multiplier, but it's alright.
[176:58.11]I feel like I'm playing Splatoon.
[177:01.07]There's 10,000?
[177:09.46]Does it look like George Washington?
[177:10.82]Yeah, that's alright.
[177:50.95]Is Splatfest tomorrow?
[177:53.09]Splatfest?

[178:06.37]No, I don't, you're right.
[178:10.44]Splatfest.
[178:12.40]Whatever it is, it sounds pretty pog.
[178:30.78]Uh-oh.
[178:33.94]Uh-oh, it ain't working.
[178:34.78]It's getting a little finicky.
[178:42.71]Damn it.
[178:43.51]That's two lives.
[178:48.39]The left side doesn't want to come all the way over.
[178:53.25]Why did I not lose any lives?
[178:54.16]That was weird.
[179:14.97]Come on now.
[179:17.00]Come on now.
[179:18.76]Come on now.
[179:55.90]Okay, my arms are starting to hurt.

[180:16.63]Oh my god, you're a genius.
[180:19.85]That's the smartest thing I've heard literally all day.
[180:22.31]I could sit here like this and just be grandpa.
[180:23.89]That's perfect.
[180:26.59]Oh my god, that's amazing!
[180:30.15]Oh yeah, this... Actually, this might not work very well.
[180:33.91]Oh no, that's not gonna work.
[180:43.67]Oh boy, this is... Oh no.
[180:46.56]Yeah... I think sitting down may have just cost me.
[181:10.95]I'll take 348,000 points, though.
[181:12.73]350?
[181:12.77]That's pretty good.

[186:09.40]I want to, it just, it just, having that headset on my head, it puts weight down here.
[186:17.46]And it just, it just chills me after a few hours.
[186:21.65]It just really does.
[186:22.29]It's awful.
[186:24.25]I could sit down too, but it's still kind of, it's the pressure on my neck with going into here and having to have my hands up for a long time.
[186:36.95]Do it laying down.
[186:38.00]That's actually really funny.
[186:39.30]Choo choo.

[187:46.36]You can play Lethal Company.
[187:48.20]I think the idea is a couple of groups that want to play it.
[187:55.24]And this one, I did say yes to a group in particular, so I want to do it.
[188:00.97]Pokester, Vinny, and me.
[188:04.01]I got that wrong?
[188:05.11]We're trying to figure it out if we're going to do it in the next week or so.
[188:15.49]I had to close it actually.
[188:25.27]Jeez.
[188:31.48]I didn't get that one.
[188:42.54]Yeah, I've heard so many good things about Lethal Company.

[190:50.32]Looks like there's two missing here.
[190:56.44]Two, three, four.
[190:57.48]There's quite a bit missing.
[191:02.10]It's probably just from doing all the story mode ones.
[191:07.06]I'm missing about half.
[191:12.70]It's definitely fun to see it because there was at least four or five that were in this one that I didn't see before.
[191:17.45]Let's do this with style.
[191:19.77]Mermaid meet and greet.
[191:43.79]I thought it meant don't move.
[191:44.87]I thought it meant hold, like don't do anything.
[191:47.15]Fan off.
[191:52.65]He's like, hold.
[191:55.73]I'm like, alright, I'm holding him.
[191:57.95]I won't do anything.

[192:18.83]I like this one.
[192:19.67]Let's go.
[192:52.43]Did I do it wrong?
[192:54.47]Oh, no.
[192:54.87]Okay, that was weird.
[192:55.59]Alright, 25.
[192:55.95]I'll get it.
[192:56.37]Don't fall.
[193:25.30]Are you gonna watch the race?
[193:27.90]No.
[193:33.32]No.
[193:34.50]That race... Is... The traffic that that race is causing... Is fucking insane.
[193:47.93]So many changes have happened on the strip.
[193:52.89]I don't go to the strip that often, but...
[193:55.43]It has definitely been very hard to move around on the Strip.
[194:01.92]Especially very recently.
[194:07.76]Did it go up?
[194:25.01]Did I catch the last frame?
[194:26.63]I got the last frame of that.
[194:31.21]Break time.
[194:43.06]Attach the wrist straps as shown.
[194:44.86]Hold the controller securely in the grip hold unless directed otherwise.
[194:51.02]Toughen up.
[194:54.51]Yeah, I think that F1 is... there's a... I think it's a pretty... I think it's gonna be around for a while.
[194:59.19]I think... or at least... I forget the exact time frame, but I know it's gonna be here for a while.
[195:07.41]It's a 10-year deal, yeah.
[195:13.32]That's just... I don't even know how you do that on the Strip.
[195:19.20]They're gonna be flying around like that?
[195:22.50]Oh, shoot.
[195:23.56]Got you.
[195:24.36]It's a 10-year race.
[195:26.38]I love this one.
[195:52.78]Alright, almost at 20.
[195:58.91]Yeah, so all the minigames I haven't seen are going to come from these ones.
[196:09.48]I don't have to unlock them all.
[196:14.16]Plus, I can play the... I can just mess around and play it again.
[196:16.50]Okay.
[196:21.97]Could you even play this out of dock mode?
[196:25.16]Is that even possible?
[196:26.46]Do you, like, wave the controller the actual time around?
[196:35.88]Bro, you look dumb as shit.
[196:39.88]Uh, I have 140 IQ and I have two PhDs.
[196:42.04]So, I mean... It's alright.
[196:51.24]What's the PhD in this?
[196:55.82]Uh... Fuckin'... Uh, math.
[196:57.46]Fuckin', uh... Um... I'm writing... Uh, blogs.
[196:59.66]About seafood or something.
[197:01.96]Hey, I got 25!
[197:21.64]Is this one different?
[197:22.34]I want to see if this one has a lot more.
[197:26.62]Lava at first sight.
[197:30.28]I plan to see you at the Las Vegas furry con.
[197:33.01]Bro.
[197:35.33]Let's go.
[197:36.57]Yeah.
[197:36.91]Are you fucking kidding me?
[197:37.75]Give me all the gold right now.
[197:39.23]Choo choo.
[197:46.90]Outrace.
[197:55.63]I want to see the Nintendo games.
[197:57.55]Blessed in the dark.
[198:04.40]That's my fursona.
[198:06.40]Let's do this.
[198:09.34]Tug of war.
[198:11.46]Dig.
[198:15.10]That was very frame rated, but cool looking.
[198:17.37]Choo choo.
[198:21.49]Pass the ring.
[198:29.47]You'd be a rooster?
[198:31.66]I was about to just do a... But I don't know how loud that would be because I'm afraid of how loud this could get.
[198:38.72]Yeah, after I went like, whoa!
[198:48.49]Ooh.
[198:59.57]I like that one.
[199:00.65]You rule.
[199:03.23]Fashionista.
[199:05.09]Scatter.
[199:06.81]Oh my goodness, I almost didn't get it.
[199:12.87]Wowee.
[199:15.20]Choo choo.
[199:17.08]Escape.
[199:21.28]Way to game.
[199:22.96]Mario 2.
[199:23.74]Gift giver.
[199:27.13]I was looking up where I... Pay attention, pay attention.
[199:34.56]Pay attention.
[199:40.80]Super Mario World 2.
[199:42.66]Yoshi's Island.
[199:43.64]That's one of my favorite Nintendo games.
[199:51.35]Fashionista.
[199:52.95]Match colors.
[199:59.50]Good old punch out.
[200:03.42]Pass through.
[200:07.14]No problem.
[200:10.93]Nice.
[200:12.47]Plunk.
[200:16.75]What?
[200:17.33]That's the first time I've gotten that one.
[200:20.03]Shake your tail.
[200:20.87]That's probably right.
[200:23.73]So cool.
[200:26.03]Boss time.
[200:30.36]Uh-oh.
[200:32.00]It's this, right?
[200:32.94]I think I fucked it up.
[200:35.23]It wasn't calibrated.
[200:36.57]Woo-hoo!
[200:37.17]Yeah!
[201:00.63]Okay.
[201:01.83]Time to hit pause!
[201:05.09]I thought I was going to get it back, too.
[201:06.41]That sucks.
[201:11.13]Attach the wrist straps as shown.
[201:14.72]Hold the controller securely in the grip hold unless directed otherwise.
[201:17.46]I think you missed every single coin.
[201:20.86]Waku up!
[201:22.34]What are you?
[201:22.82]I get 100 coins, I get an extra life?
[201:24.76]I use save states anyways.
[201:26.16]It's not going to matter.
[201:27.03]Find the question block.
[201:38.94]Fashionista.
[201:41.04]Flip it.
[201:46.52]Awesome.
[201:48.93]Choo-choo.
[201:51.05]Pass the ring.
[201:57.79]Yes.
[201:58.15]So cool.
[201:58.87]Tug of war.
[202:05.36]Hit it twice.
[202:09.91]You did it.
[202:12.75]Increase speed.
[202:16.17]Choo choo.
[202:18.05]Escape.
[202:22.22]A crushing defeat.
[202:26.96]New high score.
[202:28.28]I'll take 20.
[202:29.00]Back to it.
[202:38.39]I want to see the other games.
[202:42.71]I also want to see... Yeah, I want to see this one.
[202:48.85]Why does your facecam have a Dutch tilt?
[203:00.24]This is the life, Dribble, my friend.
[203:08.20]This is tilted.
[203:10.30]It is.
[203:10.98]It's tilted.
[203:11.74]That is a straight line.
[203:15.28]That is not supposed to be bending that way.
[203:18.08]What the hell?
[203:18.70]That's so weird.
[203:20.18]That's troubleshooting for another day.
[203:41.73]I thought you tilted it on purpose.
[203:48.41]Well, I'll figure that out.
[203:53.76]Start your engines.
[203:58.88]Fix cavities.
[204:02.90]Easy peasy.
[204:08.69]Choo choo.
[204:14.35]I like that one.
[204:14.85]I like pressing these buttons.
[204:15.85]Alright, I'm ready to give it a rating.
[204:19.56]I'm ready to give WarioWare Move it a rating.
[204:21.58]It's alright.
[204:23.71]It's alright.
[204:40.67]It's a little better than alright.
[204:42.07]It's alright.
[204:53.15]I remember smooth moves being more fun somehow.
[204:58.51]Play it.
[205:02.28]Deadly.
[205:04.50]Gift giver.
[205:06.36]Detonate.
[205:12.02]Smooth moves is the best one.
[205:13.62]Yeah.
[205:16.22]I'd say it's a fair sequel to that, if that's how you're going to look at it.
[205:23.31]There's plenty of minigames.
[205:24.17]There's plenty to do.
[205:25.05]I just feel like the weave one... Lore?
[205:30.97]Oh.
[205:31.27]Archer.
[205:43.79]I don't think it's bad.
[205:44.81]Massage.
[205:45.45]But I don't think it's great.
[205:47.03]I didn't?
[205:50.75]I don't even know what I did.
[205:52.52]Apparently I just beat it.
[205:54.54]Take your dog's paw.
[206:04.03]Massage.
[206:10.75]Okay, it's way better than bad, but it's not better than great.
[206:15.25]Just wanted to hold on to the end to give you a little bit of suspense.
[206:26.61]Massage.
[206:27.07]Shoot.
[206:50.03]It's definitely great if you had a room full of people, everybody would be screaming and like, oh my God, dude, what the fuck?
[206:56.91]I did it, you saw that, I did the controls.
[206:58.57]You did the controls, I saw you did the controls.
[207:03.32]And the huge slice of pizza, like just ripping from you.
[207:06.44]Oh, bro.
[207:07.04]Extra cheese.
[207:18.60]Why are the Ninja Turtles playing WarioWare?
[207:30.47]They'd have a lot of fun doing it.
[207:32.79]They'd be a pretty good tie in there.
[207:33.85]Turtles play WarioWare.
[207:34.39]They'd have so much fun playing this.
[207:47.96]answer dude oh my god I don't like my look at my hands are wet the problem I had is um so I'm I'm pressing one button right now and I'm pressing every single button
[208:22.08]Okay, that one was fun.
[208:27.04]I like that one a lot.
[208:43.67]I don't get this one.
[208:47.73]How do I do this one?
[208:48.47]Please help me.
[208:50.20]There's two different ways you can hold it, but I don't know what button do I press to... How do I do this one?
[208:57.12]Grip.
[209:01.68]Go to the museum and... I'm getting a bunch of no helps.
[209:05.52]I'm getting a lot of no help?
[209:12.44]Play it!
[209:14.30]Watch it!
[209:15.81]It's the Grim Knife.
[209:16.81]Grab.
[209:25.25]I'll go to the museum and practice that one.
[209:27.53]I was trying a new strategy with that one and it was a bad idea.
[210:02.67]Just barely.
[210:03.17]I didn't realize it was a 30.
[210:07.02]Massage.
[210:31.93]Jesus.
[210:33.23]And done.
[210:33.75]It's not over yet.
[210:37.25]Pre-recorded stream.
[210:39.71]Massage.
[210:41.95]Shoot.
[210:58.20]Power.
[210:59.82]Power Stone.
[211:07.93]Did I smash my desk in half like five years ago playing that?
[211:13.47]I did a chopping move and I cut the whole desk in half.
[211:19.55]That was kind of crazy.
[211:20.52]I used to be strong.
[211:22.28]I went just solidly right through the middle and caved in this way.
[211:25.64]There's a bunch of pogs in the chat, which is cool.
[211:31.08]I was in a cast for like six months.
[211:34.96]That hurt.
[211:42.01]Be careful not to get too close to the screen.
[211:44.86]Now gets hard.
[211:54.12]Night.
[211:56.24]Squeeze.
[211:58.34]Go mess up.
[212:01.96]There's no more left.
[212:02.58]Did I just go too hard?
[212:04.02]Gift giver.
[212:06.22]Answer.
[212:10.49]That one's one of the hardest ones.
[212:12.55]You wouldn't think it is, but it is.
[212:13.95]Just because of the way you have to turn your hands up.
[212:16.24]Six cavities.
[212:23.56]Aye, aye, aye.
[212:24.96]We never stood a chance.
[212:27.46]33, that's fine.
[212:27.98]Highest score yet.
[212:32.94]Into the road.
[212:42.87]Yeah, I'm filling them all up.
[212:44.37]What is this one here?
[212:48.97]Oh, it's the different poses you can do.
[212:50.87]All the sacred poses.
[212:58.94]Alright, I'll do one more.
[213:02.02]I'll do one more of these.
[213:02.86]Let's do Jimmy T. And then I'll try to get 25 again on hard.
[213:09.74]And then I'm going to take off.
[213:10.76]I'm going to get some dinner.
[213:13.38]Next time you see me will be at some point next week.
[213:18.29]Gonna try to get Lethal Company going.
[213:21.71]And then after that, I'm not sure.
[213:23.77]Also, the 24th, remember, Grotto Beasts TTS is coming out on the 24th.
[213:29.80]On top of that, the store is gonna go on sale.
[213:33.30]There's gonna be a little sale.
[213:35.92]to just... There's still some remaining inventory.
[213:37.92]There's not a lot, but there's enough to be able to do a sale.
[213:44.33]And then the store is going to come down at the end of the year.
[213:47.55]After that, the TTS is going to get like six months of updates over the course of the next January through six months.
[213:59.40]Should be fun.
[214:00.54]The whole community can kind of just live over there.
[214:04.74]Man bun?
[214:05.20]That's right.
[214:08.66]Let's do it.
[214:14.81]Oh, let's go.
[214:16.79]Sink.
[214:17.09]Nice.
[214:17.49]Love strike.
[214:23.46]Gaze.
[214:28.34]Say love you.
[214:29.30]Hello?
[214:29.84]Why is it?
[214:31.32]Pounce.
[214:33.53]Blend in.
[214:37.25]Ooh, that one's cool.
[214:50.30]Why is the retired old man playing WarioWare?
[214:53.40]Oh, also, I'm gonna make a post in the Discord at some point in the next few days.
[214:59.39]It's gonna be like a long paragraph Andy explaining exactly what that means because uh every time I say the word retirement people go wait what's happening and I want to make it clear kind of what that means.
[215:14.45]I can just tell you right now I'm gonna write it out point to so we don't to keep talking about it over and over and over again I want to be able to have mods be able to point to and be like look this is what he said rather than
[215:29.72]Oh, hello.
[215:30.62]Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[215:35.14]So, effectively, streams are going to... Streams are going to be a hobby.
[215:45.85]I'm not going to have a set schedule.
[215:47.25]I'm not going to have a set, really, time.
[215:48.97]I don't know if that means... I don't know if that's once a month, twice a month, five times a month.
[215:56.90]I have no idea.
[215:57.50]I'm not going to give it any...
[216:02.49]Hold on, let me pause it.
[216:04.35]I'm not going to give it any time frame.
[216:06.99]This being a streamer is going to turn into a hobby for me.
[216:10.37]While I work on other stuff, other things in my life, obviously like off-brand.
[216:14.74]You saw the Doug Doug thing that's doing a lot of that right now.
[216:19.72]But I'm not leaving.
[216:21.44]I'm just going to stream kind of when I feel like it.
[216:23.88]So that could be more than once a week.
[216:25.86]That might be once every two weeks.
[216:27.91]Who knows?
[216:28.33]It might be three or four times in a row.
[216:32.98]So it's just going to be when I feel like it.
[216:35.27]So what that means effectively is your subscription to this channel, you're going to have to figure out what to do with that.
[216:44.53]I'm not going to encourage subs.
[216:46.13]I never really did ever.
[216:48.11]But I mean, subbing to this channel, if there's one stream a month,
[216:54.14]I cannot tell you what to do.
[216:58.41]I cannot force you to unsubscribe from this channel.
[217:03.01]But just keep that in mind, knowing that over the next three, four, five, six months, it's just going to be whenever I feel like it.
[217:12.22]And if you don't think that's worth paying for, don't do it.
[217:14.64]Effectively.
[217:21.58]So I'm going to be discouraging subs.
[217:23.65]Well, I don't know.
[217:29.05]There's going to be times when... I mean, I felt like playing WarioWare today, and that's what I did.
[217:35.93]Elden Ring is going to come out, obviously.
[217:37.64]I might stream that five days in a row.
[217:42.74]I don't know.
[217:48.04]And this is something that I've been thinking about for a long time.
[217:53.29]I'll make a post, too, to make sure this can be pointed to.
[217:55.57]Because I know every time I talk about this, people go like, wait, huh?
[217:59.42]I didn't know that.
[218:01.06]So, without needing to talk about this every single time I scream, which I know people are probably getting kind of sick of hearing about it.
[218:07.24]Which I get it.
[218:07.66]I understand.
[218:12.18]But this has been a thing I've been thinking about since before Dollhouse.
[218:18.34]And then, obviously, I tried to do a bunch of events and shows, and that was a ton of fun.
[218:24.30]It was amazing.
[218:26.00]And I'm not telling you that I'm not ever going to do an event or a show on this channel.
[218:30.50]It's not what I'm saying.
[218:32.83]Do I feel like it's going to be fun?
[218:35.83]That's not right.
[218:39.85]Are you stopping completely after six months?
[218:43.19]No.
[218:44.73]No, it's just whenever.
[218:46.03]This is going to turn into a hobby.
[218:51.50]That's good.
[218:53.60]I don't want to... This is not something I want to be a... Sort.
[218:57.64]Ooh, ah.
[218:59.20]I wouldn't like it.
[219:00.06]Too bad.
[219:02.62]It's heating up.
[219:04.48]Started as a hobby, returns to as a hobby.
[219:06.80]It's a good thing.
[219:07.53]Match.
[219:08.83]Ah.
[219:10.25]Nice.
[219:11.47]Like a champ.
[219:13.41]So, I mean, honestly, the thing that will change is just... I won't be around that frequently.
[219:19.97]Nice.
[219:21.22]on a regular basis.
[219:29.68]But I don't know.
[219:30.70]That could change.
[219:31.46]I could decide I'm gonna stream like five times in a row, like I said.
[219:35.51]It's a good career move.
[219:37.93]Real talk.
[219:49.37]As I get to be almost 40 years old, I can definitely feel it, that I kind of want to make a move, right?
[219:56.92]There's other things that I want to do, other stuff that I think is worth exploring.
[220:03.40]And that's where I want to put the focus, is there.
[220:07.32]Because really, if you think about it, I've got, like...
[220:18.97]How much longer am I going to be doing this or wanting to do it or care about it?
[220:24.65]Will I be like 50?
[220:25.45]We've never seen somebody in these spaces truly kind of leave.
[220:32.74]Maybe a few.
[220:33.42]Maybe one or two, right?
[220:35.46]But I don't know.
[220:36.44]Retiring from being a live streamer is like, how the fuck do you even do that?
[220:40.61]What does that even mean?
[220:44.01]Why can't I pick this up?
[220:53.64]They're supposed to be on the ground and I wasn't paying attention.
[220:56.09]Alright.
[220:57.87]Super hard mode.
[220:58.69]We're going super hard.
[221:00.67]Did you do a senior stream?
[221:08.51]What?
[221:18.20]Gotcha.
[221:18.78]But I will put that on... I'll put it in the Discord.
[221:20.98]And the Discord's another thing, too.
[221:22.62]It's eventually... I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but I have to be honest, because let's be real.
[221:29.41]I've got to figure out what to do with all these community spaces that I'm not going to be paying that much attention to a year or two years, three years from now, right?
[221:36.23]I don't know.
[221:37.78]I would never delete it, but there's going to have to be probably some reduction in changes on how much I want to pay attention to an official space like that.
[221:51.19]The game is loud.
[221:53.29]Damn, that one is really hard.
[221:54.95]Alright, restart.
[221:55.61]I gotta pay attention.
[222:25.03]Is the worst game possible to be playing while trying to focus on... I know, it's like... Yeah, guys, so I've got something really important to say.
[222:33.70]Um, I, uh, fuck.
[222:35.94]Um... So, yeah, when I... Yeah, I... Yeah, this is a bad game to play with.
[222:41.94]Alright, TL;DR.
[222:48.46]I'm going into like a soft retirement phase.
[222:52.15]And what that means is that I'm just doing this as a hobby and that's it.
[222:55.93]That might be one stream a month.
[222:57.31]That might be 10 streams a month.
[222:58.69]It's just whenever the fuck I feel like it.
[223:00.24]That's it.
[223:01.04]That's all you need to know.
[223:01.82]I ain't going anywhere.
[223:07.68]amazing I'll make a post about it because I've seen people hey there not bad okay this I've seen people that are very very confused and some people are upset about this which I I understand I've been doing this for a very long time and I started streaming seven to eight years ago I was doing youtube for six or seven years it a lot of people are used to this space being the way that it is and
[223:35.32]Me too.
[223:36.16]This is new for me.
[223:37.54]So, we'll see how it goes.
[223:42.70]But I think I'm gonna be happy doing this.
[223:44.72]It's a lot less pressure too, because I'll be honest, that's something to think about as well, is how much pressure that I'm putting on myself to continue to do stuff like this.
[223:57.17]Not like this stream, but you know, just streaming in general.
[223:59.75]And trying to do more things, and more crazier things, and...
[224:11.19]And I don't want to treat this with disrespect because this has been... I mean, this is a dream job.
[224:18.51]It's a dream career.
[224:20.15]This is un-fucking-believable.
[224:22.53]I've been able to make a lot of money.
[224:24.33]I've been able to secure my life.
[224:27.31]I get to live in Las Vegas.
[224:29.59]It's not...
[224:32.41]It's not easy right now for a lot of people.
[224:34.49]And I find myself insanely fortunate.
[224:37.71]I don't know, I just don't want to treat this space with disrespect or anything, because I wouldn't be doing this if there weren't a shitload of people here, right?
[224:46.58]So I have to be aware of that.
[224:50.78]Squat.
[225:03.53]This is not a good idea.
[225:04.97]This is so funny.
[225:05.97]Yeah, so guys, I mean, yeah, it's, you know, maybe thinking about stopping streaming at some point in my life.
[225:13.83]How many strawberries were there?
[225:15.59]Three?
[225:15.77]Oh, there were four.
[225:16.53]Be careful.
[225:18.05]Lifter.
[225:21.39]Cosmic.
[225:22.84]Crocodile.
[225:26.16]Sweet.
[225:27.42]Massage.
[225:32.49]Unbelievable.
[225:33.33]What?
[225:34.73]Alright, I'm trying for real this time.
[225:42.42]You choose the hardest path every time.
[225:46.06]Never give up.
[225:47.46]Got to challenge yourself.
[225:50.11]Hey.
[225:51.93]Got to challenge yourself.
[225:53.43]Look at that.
[225:53.85]You don't get strong by not doing anything, right?
[225:57.85]Let's go.
[226:00.15]Scales.
[226:02.35]Yeah, people said, like, is he going back to YouTube?
[226:13.56]Is he going to do YouTube stuff?
[226:15.82]Maybe.
[226:16.86]I'd like to.
[226:18.48]I have ideas of stuff that I want to make for videos, but I don't know.
[226:20.86]We'll see.
[226:22.60]It's going to just be a whatever happens, happens.
[226:26.30]Whenever that happens.
[226:27.70]At the same time,
[226:32.19]At the same time, continue to do stuff with off-brand as I'm an executive at that company.
[226:40.19]So I gotta give that attention, because that's what I want.
[226:42.27]I want to do that.
[226:43.89]That's not getting it?
[226:46.39]What was that?
[226:46.95]Oh, he's an executive now, yeah.
[227:04.75]This is the one for sure I'm locked in right now
[227:37.67]You did it!

[229:16.99]Stunning.
[229:17.57]Choo choo.
[229:38.13]Are we ever going to know what the last stream ever is?
[229:40.11]I don't know.
[229:40.51]Probably not.
[229:41.13]I just think... I can't really think about that.
[229:46.15]I don't think I want to do that.
[229:47.72]Because what if I don't?
[229:51.78]What if that's not true?
[230:10.79]I love trucks.
[230:13.49]Care greetings.
[230:14.81]Nice.

[231:57.64]It's true.
[232:42.97]Alright, good.

[237:13.75]That's why when you the house is a little slanted.
[237:17.55]But I did it.
[237:18.55]I made that.
[237:19.23]I make this house look like bare hands.
[237:23.23]Can't learn that on TikTok.
[237:29.14]So what?
[237:30.39]So what if you can't put a drink on the table?
