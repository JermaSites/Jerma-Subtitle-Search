[ve:60.16.100]

[01:02.57]Good morning.
[01:02.93]1140, still morning.
[01:08.96]It's not afternoon for another 20 minutes.
[01:13.40]Unscheduled stream, that's right.
[01:16.78]Told you it was going to happen.
[01:23.61]Give me one second.
[01:24.91]I'll be right back.
[01:34.05]Okay, so.
[02:03.40]Here's what's going to happen today.
[02:05.34]This is off schedule, obviously.
[02:06.68]We're just going to hang out, chill, and play a little bit of Overwatch.
[02:10.40]A game that I haven't played in a fairly long time.
[02:15.21]So because I have not played in a long time, and I don't want to embarrass myself playing competitive mode or something along those lines, we're just going to do viewer games.
[02:26.27]You guys can play.
[02:27.27]I don't care who it is.
[02:29.31]It's not like a sub-only thing today.
[02:30.87]Don't worry.
[02:32.23]We're just gonna play the game.
[02:32.97]We're gonna hang out, talk, have fun.
[02:36.25]This is an EU-friendly stream.
[02:38.19]I told you there'd be at least one.
[02:40.99]You get one EU-friendly stream every 60 fucking days.
[02:47.60]So, give me one second.
[03:02.69]Okay.
[03:04.13]So how this works, how this is going to work, is you're very simply gonna put your... First of all, you better be in Overwatch.
[03:12.15]Get in the game Overwatch if you want to play.
[03:14.57]I'm just gonna take random people.
[03:18.38]There's no rhyme or reason to this.
[03:19.80]It's just gonna be random people, random battle tags.
[03:22.22]If you're in the game, please tell me.
[03:23.84]And we're gonna add random fucking people.
[03:29.50]I literally just put my Glue Man shirt on that arrived today.
[03:33.14]You instantly go live.
[03:34.10]Did I summon you?
[03:36.12]Well, how did your Glue Man shirt arrive today?
[03:38.14]Was it like they ship it around the world 20 times?
[03:45.81]But nonetheless, thanks, man.
[03:49.05]Yeah, I'm just going to do random, random, random, random, random.
[03:53.47]So I'm going to start it now.
[03:54.71]Let me...
[04:00.43]Is there a way I can... There we go.
[04:04.00]Here you are.
[04:05.14]Make sure you're in the game, by the way.
[04:08.72]If you're not in the game, it's not going to work.
[04:14.80]We'll do this a few times.
[04:17.79]There needs to be no space there.
[04:22.23]They may be in competitive mode.
[04:23.87]Well, make sure you're in the game.
[04:24.91]Make sure you're just in the menu.
[04:30.34]So I kind of have a free... I'm just random people, guys.
[04:33.38]Don't worry.
[04:34.62]Maybe you'll get in at some point.
[04:35.74]I hope.
[04:36.32]I can get as many people as possible in.
[04:37.96]Would be a good thing, right?
[04:38.94]Let's get out here.
[04:53.03]Okay.
[04:53.83]Freeze it right there.
[04:58.70]Make sure you're in the game.
[05:00.66]If you're not in the game, it ain't going to work.
[05:09.24]Teams, I'm just doing random teams.
[05:20.80]Maybe eventually here in the next, maybe within the next hour or something, we'll do like a sub only one or something like that.
[05:27.10]But initially, we're just going to do viewers.
[05:31.58]This is PC, yep.
[05:38.65]Oh, come on.
[05:39.17]Stop freezing on me.
[05:47.40]No, I don't want to show more messages.
[05:49.42]Why is it automatically scrolling down?
[05:51.80]Stop doing this to me.
[05:54.00]What the fuck?
[05:59.94]Can any mods in here do me a massive favor?
[06:04.50]Can you just PM me a bunch of random names?
[06:07.53]Because it's so hard for me to grab some of these people.
[06:10.11]Because it's going too fast.
[06:16.93]That would be extremely helpful.
[06:23.42]Just send me like a Twitch PM.
[06:31.44]Because I can't.
[06:32.08]I got it to stop last time.
[06:33.14]I don't know why I can't get it to stop anymore.
[06:43.73]It's been a long time since I played Overwatch.
[06:45.79]Very long time.
[06:48.93]Ronnie, you want to play?
[06:50.15]I'll get you in here, Ronnie, if you want.
[06:53.05]Are you in the game?
[06:53.96]No, you're not.
[06:56.44]Just screenshot chat.
[06:57.56]I mean, I could do that.
[06:59.12]But that's kind of a pain in the ass.
[07:03.09]Here we go.
[07:04.83]Thank you, Minxie.
[07:05.87]I appreciate it.
[07:09.41]This is going to help immensely.
[07:16.74]Makes it much easier just to be able to do it.
[07:18.38]It's hard for me to just scroll, grab somebody.
[07:20.98]Oh, fuck.
[07:21.52]I missed him.
[07:26.32]Thank you very much.
[07:26.92]Appreciate it.
[07:29.35]Oh, look at this mod.
[07:29.87]Look at this mod coming through in the clutch, huh?
[07:33.68]This is a new mod, by the way.
[07:35.56]This is Minxie's new mod.
[07:36.68]Look at this new mod.
[07:50.50]Orthocone 2.
[07:51.10]Look at these mods.
[07:52.82]Doing all kinds of work.
[07:58.46]And we'll play a couple rounds of these guys, and then we'll choose some more people.
[08:02.74]There are going to be multiple opportunities.
[08:05.20]So don't worry.
[08:07.83]Is there somebody actually named Crusher?
[08:09.61]Did somebody actually get that name?
[08:12.69]How did you get this name?
[08:21.78]How is it even possible that you got that name?
[08:23.36]I thought that was like a fake Blizzard name.
[08:26.94]It might even be a fake Blizzard name.
[08:37.74]Wait, what?
[08:39.18]Make sure you're in Overwatch.
[08:42.02]You have to physically be in the game and in the menu.
[08:45.45]Otherwise, these aren't going to work.
[08:47.77]Wait, what?
[08:50.69]We need a couple more.
[08:51.59]There we go.
[09:01.75]Two more, two more, two more.
[09:03.11]Try it again.
[09:09.69]Is there like a space here that's being added for some reason?
[09:12.08]I guess.
[09:12.86]No, doesn't matter.
[09:20.40]Hope you guys are having a good Sunday.
[09:22.18]I'm having a great Sunday.
[09:23.30]Let's try that one more time.
[09:30.45]Nope.
[09:38.51]How can half of these not be working?
[09:43.18]Make sure there's no space.
[09:46.90]Nope.
[09:52.47]I love this guy's name.
[09:53.23]This guy better be in the game.
[09:55.53]I hope this one works because you have the best battle tag I think I've seen all day.
[09:59.69]Count Chocula.
[10:01.87]Come on!
[10:02.35]Yes!
[10:02.73]Count Chocula worked!
[10:06.48]Thank goodness for Count Chocula.
[10:15.35]Make sure there's no space.
[10:16.37]Okay.
[10:17.41]Alright, we got it.
[10:18.58]We got our first team.
[10:19.88]Thank you, mods.
[10:24.74]Fucking thing sucks.
[10:27.04]I'm not on the PTR server, no.
[10:28.24]At least I don't think so.
[10:30.24]You know, that's a good question.
[10:33.44]I really don't think I am.
[10:35.24]We'll find out, right?
[10:39.15]I thought I picked the regular one.
[10:42.35]Alright, let's do it.
[10:45.14]The first of many.
[10:48.56]And away we go.
[10:52.24]Let's hope this server doesn't break.
[10:56.72]Oh, nice.
[10:57.16]I love Eichenwalde.
[11:00.83]Get some spectators in?
[11:02.73]No, we gotta go.
[11:04.81]I don't want to sit there for another ten minutes putting names in.
[11:11.81]Alright.
[11:12.49]I haven't played anything on Sombra.
[11:15.12]I want to try Sombra.
[11:16.18]Defense Sombra?
[11:16.90]Does that work?
[11:20.44]Make never trust a purple mod already?
[11:26.32]You know, that might happen.
[11:28.14]It might happen today.
[11:29.60]That might happen today, this afternoon.
[11:33.76]Shift it to the Jerma universe first.
[11:36.34]Let's play this game.
[11:39.65]Oh shit, I forgot to make the rules different.
[11:44.04]Oh yeah, next time we gotta make it one hero.
[11:46.76]Because now we have three sombras.
[11:51.96]Greetings.
[11:53.68]I played on this map once.
[11:55.40]So I don't even know what anything is.
[11:56.54]But we'll find it.
[11:57.06]We'll figure it out, right?
[11:59.26]Maybe I gotta hack this stuff.
[12:00.74]I gotta download MS-DOS.
[12:01.48]I think that's not working.
[12:12.04]Don't push, only target me.
[12:14.76]Look at this team.
[12:15.92]We get three Sombra's and Merc... Is this the new, like, meta?
[12:19.44]Did I miss something?
[12:21.64]Three Sombra's is the meta.
[12:22.85]Uh, I'm definitely going to Pax East.
[12:26.53]If there's any convention that you can guarantee I will always be at, it's Pax East.
[12:31.17]Every time.
[12:42.32]Hack him.
[12:43.75]Nice, I hacked him.
[12:44.51]I don't really know what any of this stuff does.
[12:55.55]Oh my god!
[12:57.23]Okay, what do these moves do?
[13:00.47]Okay, I think I know what the moves do now.
[13:01.71]Alright, Sombra, you can hack people.
[13:05.27]You can hack and then you can dash.
[13:07.17]I got it.
[13:11.80]And that gives you speed too, right?
[13:13.42]Yes, it does.
[13:18.21]Okay, so hacking people turns off their moves, right?
[13:25.29]I assume.
[13:27.57]Nope, okay.
[13:31.13]Sick plays.
[13:35.23]Well, you gotta remember, you gotta look at the stream title.
[13:40.90]I barely know how to play this video game.
[13:42.78]That's my excuse.
[13:43.60]It's my only excuse.
[13:47.32]So hacking health packs means that your team can take them, but you, they can't, right?
[13:53.82]I think.
[13:54.10]Okay.
[14:18.60]Hold on.
[14:25.96]Ah, shit!
[14:27.62]It poisons the enemy if they pick it up?
[14:29.00]Okay, cool.
[14:29.90]That's good to know.
[14:34.90]How many fucking times am I gonna mispronounce Count Chocula's name?
[14:37.94]A lot.
[14:39.34]Oh boy, I'm not doing so hot.
[14:41.90]Yeah, it's a good thing we got this pro-Count-Captain Chocula on our team.
[14:48.17]So is she, like, a flanker?
[14:51.46]Yes.
[14:52.56]Of course she is.
[15:00.90]How the fuck did you know?
[15:01.62]How did you know?
[15:02.18]What?
[15:02.36]I thought I was fucking invisible.
[15:05.95]It doesn't poison them?
[15:11.67]Oh, what the fuck?
[15:15.99]I thought it really did poison them.
[15:20.60]I was going to be like, oh, they touch it and they get like acid on them.
[15:26.26]Hey, hey, hey.
[15:28.10]Can I re-hack it?
[15:29.86]What happens if I hack it?
[15:31.84]I'm so confused.
[15:32.60]Man.
[15:48.94]Man.
[15:58.42]Hacker.
[16:00.04]Hack the mainframe.
[16:03.85]This gun kind of sucks.
[16:05.35]This gun sucks.
[16:10.13]I can't, like, use this gun.
[16:21.00]Should I, like, be burst firing with this thing?
[16:23.38]Or do I need to be, like, right up their ass to hurt them?
[16:28.89]Back that shit.
[16:34.40]Whoa!
[16:35.02]Okay.
[16:36.00]Back out this way.
[16:59.93]They're gonna be like right up their ass to do it.
[17:03.51]Where'd he go?
[17:07.92]Hacker!
[17:08.66]Hack!
[17:09.18]Nope, I can't hack.
[17:14.52]Oh, shit.
[17:17.90]I'm starting to get the hang of it a little bit.
[17:19.20]Starting to get the hang of her.
[17:21.34]Nice ult.
[17:21.67]What does the ult do?
[17:24.27]Does the ult, like, turn him off?
[17:25.67]I don't understand.
[17:31.91]Should I not have done that?
[17:32.73]Maybe I should have looked at the hero list first to see what she did.
[17:36.45]I think we're going to win.
[17:38.89]Yeah, we won.
[17:41.40]Hey, I didn't even get bronze.
[17:45.36]I'm alright.
[17:47.86]That was fun.
[17:50.64]Alright, ult cancels everybody's shields and silences.
[17:54.86]Okay, cool.
[17:57.75]Let's see what the play of the game is.
[18:05.99]That's kind of cool.
[18:06.57]She's cool.
[18:08.63]I didn't get a single medal.
[18:09.89]No.
[18:10.71]Come on.
[18:10.99]Give me a little bit of slack.
[18:12.55]I've played on that map twice.
[18:15.33]And this is my first video game playing Overwatch in like six months.
[18:21.00]Come on.
[18:22.00]Come on.
[18:22.64]Give me a little bit of slack.
[18:24.92]You're lucky I got five eliminations and not zero.
[18:27.86]Now we're going to flip it around.
[18:33.40]Wait.
[18:34.12]What?
[18:37.26]Thank you to... PyTinNinja for 13 months.
[18:41.58]They say hi.
[18:42.84]Hi to you.
[18:44.76]Zachary, thanks for two months.
[18:46.14]Nuffy.
[18:47.63]Nuffy, thanks for the subscription.
[18:49.11]GunsWazabi.
[18:51.23]Sebx for 13.
[18:51.69]They say Star B. Well, Star B. Aronorth for five months.
[18:56.31]Make Never Trust a Purple Amon.
[18:57.53]He's the one that brought it up.
[18:58.81]Thanks, Aronorth.
[19:00.75]Rag Tredo.
[19:02.50]Fox, if you're here for 10 months, you missed my birthday.
[19:04.92]Well, happy belated birthday.
[19:07.00]What do we got for a team?
[19:10.35]I'll be this guy.
[19:13.83]Happy birthday, Fox.
[19:15.35]Thanks for 10 months.
[19:16.95]Silvone for 7 months.
[19:17.81]Came for the coffee.
[19:18.35]Stayed for the Cheetos and the chicken.
[19:20.57]It's a party.
[19:22.51]Pattycan.
[19:23.85]Super Sans Sheriff.
[19:25.69]That's not what your name was.
[19:26.67]And Minxie subscribed last night.
[19:29.24]Thanks, Minxie.
[19:30.66]Thanks, Chipmunk.
[19:33.32]Never trust a purple.
[19:34.16]Gave a thousand bits.
[19:35.24]Thanks a lot, purple.
[19:36.66]You're gonna mod after this game.
[19:40.02]You've been around for a long time.
[19:44.61]Remember when I was good at video games is what you should be saying.
[19:46.94]Remember when I mained Roadhog?
[19:50.24]Remember when I wasn't dog shit at every game I played?
[19:53.58]I remember that.
[19:54.24]That was great.
[19:56.66]Remember when that fat guy did the splash into the pool?
[20:00.46]I remember that.
[20:02.70]Alright, let's do this.
[20:04.52]No, we don't.
[20:13.24]Maybe when I beat Dark Souls 3, that's true.
[20:24.81]Let's forget how to play as Roadhog 2.
[20:26.17]Oh, I got a damage booster.
[20:34.97]Do they have two turrets?
[20:41.96]That's not good.
[20:50.50]Oh my fucking god, that's not a person, that's another turret.
[20:55.44]Do they have like three, four Torbjörn's?
[21:02.35]My lord, they have too many shields!
[21:04.91]They're too hard to kill!
[21:06.57]Give me a second, I'll fix it.
[21:08.17]We're gonna have to, I'm gonna have to go like Pharah or something.
[21:19.28]Come over here.
[21:19.80]We'll get this.
[21:25.91]It's just a sentry town.
[21:27.53]Okay.
[21:31.65]There was just three molten cores at the same time.
[21:37.95]I need to put on hero limits.
[21:41.29]Something I forgot to do.
[21:42.31]Where's Feral?
[21:48.36]Place Symmetra on the PTR.
[21:51.16]No, no PTR today.
[21:52.36]Let's see if I can shoot any of these turrets.
[22:03.95]No, sort of.
[22:04.95]The answer to that question is sort of.
[22:10.63]Oh my god.
[22:11.43]There's too many Torbjorns.
[22:20.00]Did I get it?
[22:20.50]I got it.
[22:22.74]I got another turret to take care of.
[22:25.85]No, I'm dead.
[22:28.73]Pocket healed streamer.
[22:29.79]What a role model.
[22:32.63]Come on, man.
[22:36.27]Come on, man.
[22:40.33]Come on, man.
[22:52.87]Alright, that stupid fucking light post is blocking my shots.
[22:57.13]Just look at this.
[22:57.95]Well, see that fucking dumb light post right here?
[23:00.46]Watch this.
[23:01.44]That's fucking dog shit.
[23:05.52]We're gonna lose.
[23:15.18]Why don't we hit by the... Oh, yeah, good.
[23:16.73]The stupid light post didn't take me out.
[23:18.67]Good.
[23:19.05]Alright, we're good.
[23:25.84]Ow.
[23:30.18]At least it's dead.
[23:32.06]I don't even know where the health packs are here.
[23:37.65]There's one.
[23:38.27]Shit.
[23:48.29]Still have to download the giant Sombra update.
[23:52.97]How big of a patch was it?
[23:54.33]Was it that big of a patch?
[24:05.25]Can you give me a good BF?
[24:06.65]Oh, you just got one.
[24:10.13]You got a super BF.
[24:16.71]It's the turrets.
[24:18.96]Oh boy, I'm in trouble up here.
[24:21.89]Alright, where the hell are the turrets?
[24:23.37]There's like, oh god, there's a fucking hundred of them.
[24:25.46]I'm dead.
[24:29.66]Oh my god, I'm so fucking dead.
[24:31.26]There's nothing I can do here.
[24:32.04]I just have to go die.
[24:36.90]There's no way for me to go.
[24:41.73]The all tour of your strategy.
[24:44.67]Alright, make sure I don't forget to make hero limits on.
[24:56.70]Because if I forget to do that, it's going to be a pain in the ass again.
[24:58.74]Too many molten cores!
[25:21.79]Holy shit, what a revive.
[25:29.06]Nice ult.
[25:30.94]Oh, we're gonna lose.
[25:39.01]Does Pharah get a buff?
[25:41.25]I think I remember Pharah getting some kind of buff, right?
[25:45.31]Should have been Sombra.
[25:46.83]No, should have put a hero limit on, is what you meant to say.
[25:57.56]Nobody can stuff the floor to your Torbjörn.
[26:07.71]Ferris Hover is now OP.
[26:09.01]That's cool.
[26:16.73]Thank you for playing.
[26:19.32]Very much appreciate it.
[26:20.84]Let's do it again.
[26:25.21]Again?
[26:25.45]Alright.
[26:26.98]Settings.
[26:27.32]Hold on.
[26:28.40]Temple of Anubis off.
[26:31.40]Alright.
[26:32.22]Where is it?
[26:33.42]Hero limit selection.
[26:34.42]One per team.
[26:36.64]Roll selection.
[26:37.24]That don't matter.
[26:37.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:39.54]No, no, no.
[26:42.04]You can turn off certain heroes.
[26:45.11]That's fine.
[26:45.61]Okay.
[26:50.33]Let's get some more people in here.
[26:54.29]rule set is quick about whatever okay save add players same deal if my moderators could give me a solid and get some people in here we need a Jerma play the game I believe in you well you got to get remember don't worry I'll get to play the game if I don't get to play the game at some point today then
[27:23.98]I won't stop streaming.
[27:25.10]I can't, I will, I cannot stop streaming until I get a play of the game.
[27:28.10]How does that sound?
[27:29.14]Does that sound like a deal?
[27:30.85]That's a pretty good deal to me.
[27:34.85]No, that just, okay.
[27:36.45]Might have just fucking shot myself in the foot there.
[27:40.83]Okay, 24 hour stream confirmed.
[27:42.57]That's a pretty good deal to me.
[27:47.75]Why am I hearing myself?
[27:50.88]No, that just, okay.
[27:51.90]What the fuck is happening?
[27:52.88]Shut up, Jerma.
[27:56.76]Alright, let's do this.
[28:02.96]Remember to make sure you're in the game.
[28:06.97]It's very important.
[28:16.30]Very, very important.
[28:21.72]And mods, if you could, try to get people that haven't been selected, if you can remember their names.
[28:31.54]I guess maybe try to keep a tally somewhere of who's been invited and who hasn't.
[28:34.92]I mean, it's okay to get the same person to come in more than once.
[28:41.08]But I'd like to keep as many people new as possible, if you could try to keep it like that.
[28:45.88]That would be fantastic.
[28:46.66]Fantastic.
[28:52.71]Some of you guys have awesome names.
[28:59.73]Who else is there?
[29:00.83]Is this guy?
[29:01.97]Did I try to invite this guy yet?
[29:03.27]This is going a lot faster than last time, so that's good.
[29:23.18]Who else?
[29:23.60]This guy.
[29:30.99]By the way, this is 60 FPS.
[29:32.55]The first time I've tried to stream an intensive game like this in 60.
[29:37.17]Hopefully it looks alright.
[29:39.57]I can feel it stuttering a little bit, but once I get that 6900.
[29:45.84]Battle tags are case sensitive.
[29:47.16]Are they actually...
[29:54.08]I did not know that.
[30:02.81]There we go.
[30:07.33]Four more.
[30:07.91]This guy's name is HPDeskJet.
[30:16.62]Like the fucking printer.
[30:18.70]I wish I could invite him.
[30:23.86]How about one of these guys?
[30:25.24]Let's try to get your hand in here this time, Hest.
[30:31.57]There we go.
[30:41.11]Alright.
[30:44.31]Three more.
[30:48.01]Three more.
[30:48.59]There we go.
[30:49.07]Hell yeah.
[30:54.50]We'll do a sub game after this.
[31:05.88]We'll do two viewer games and then a sub game.
[31:08.22]Two viewer games, sub game.
[31:09.77]I think that would be fair, right?
[31:11.63]That sounds fair enough.
[31:18.78]What would Hitman's powers be in Overwatch?
[31:21.79]Neck snap would be one of them.
[31:23.01]Alright, one more person.
[31:23.79]Come on.
[31:24.17]Let's get it.
[31:24.73]Come on.
[31:24.95]Double zero.
[31:26.43]Remember that joke?
[31:27.05]Remember the double zero joke?
[31:28.03]I'm going to use it right now.
[31:34.71]This should be good.
[31:38.23]Ah, come on.
[31:41.60]What about this guy?
[31:43.38]This guy's already in.
[31:44.52]What about this guy?
[31:50.16]I don't think this guy's in yet.
[31:51.40]One more person.
[32:05.63]You.
[32:07.73]You.
[32:11.22]Did I already invite this guy?
[32:12.50]Maybe.
[32:12.98]Well, whatever.
[32:14.02]There we go.
[32:14.56]Alright.
[32:15.64]Beautiful.
[32:18.06]Let's make sure my settings are all saved.
[32:21.49]Oh, one hero per team.
[32:22.91]Alright, let's do it.
[32:28.29]Thank you for trying to play.
[32:31.95]Let's go to Hollywood.
[32:33.77]And I gotta get a play of the game where I'm not allowed to stop streaming.
[32:37.31]Very important that I do that.
[32:42.29]Alright, what do we got?
[32:43.63]Let's get a good team here.
[32:48.39]Gonna heat up my hand too.
[32:49.41]It's too cold in here.
[32:51.34]Where's my degree changer?
[32:54.13]My heater.
[32:55.21]Where's my degree changer?
[32:56.61]There it is.
[33:01.43]Get it up there.
[33:02.09]Come on.
[33:03.05]Heat this shit up.
[33:07.10]Use a Google Docs for him?
[33:08.08]That's not a bad idea.
[33:08.88]That's something I'd have to set up for next time.
[33:10.82]Alright, defense.
[33:13.12]Yeah, we kinda... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:16.02]Let's just...
[33:20.49]Play some Junkrat.
[33:29.24]I don't think I can do 60 FPS, unfortunately.
[33:32.80]Fuck, I really gotta get that new CPU so bad.
[33:35.30]Because it's fine right now.
[33:39.68]But when action heats up... Yeah.
[33:46.77]Oh well.
[33:48.29]I can deal with it.
[33:48.77]It'll be alright.
[33:58.01]James Frost?
[33:59.47]What do you mean?
[34:00.07]What's James Frost?
[34:06.96]Yeah, you do.
[34:07.66]What happened to the supercomputer?
[34:08.96]It's just too old now.
[34:10.74]You weren't here last stream.
[34:11.90]I got made fun of for having my computer.
[34:21.64]Last time I streamed, people said I had a 780, and it was like... I committed treason.
[34:26.52]Damn it.
[34:33.59]That was dumb.
[34:41.95]Watch out for that sniper.
[34:42.91]There's a lot of people in there.
[35:00.46]That was a good Windows 10 activation code.
[35:05.24]Anybody going around us?
[35:07.10]No.
[35:12.52]Come on, come on, come on!
[35:16.29]Somebody show their face!
[35:17.23]He's going up here.
[35:24.07]Fuck it.
[35:27.57]I'm going right in that door.
[35:33.95]I thought that was a bad guy.
[35:34.93]I thought that was a bad guy.
[35:59.00]That's fucking 60 FPS ain't even working for me.
[36:01.18]That's what happened.
[36:06.96]I'm dead.
[36:10.07]I'm gonna chase something else.
[36:11.25]Uh, I'm gonna play Reaper.
[36:15.51]I'm streaming at under 900 FPS.
[36:24.91]You know you haven't played this game in a long time?
[36:27.17]When you try to kill your own Zarya with a tire.
[36:30.74]You know that's about you, but you need to do a little bit of practice.
[36:36.37]This is what we do this for, though.
[36:37.39]This is why I do this.
[36:38.67]I need practice.
[36:47.60]Oh my god, what the hell are you doing right there?
[36:49.94]I'm so dead.
[36:53.38]She was just aiming and firing right in the line of sight where my fucking head was.
[37:04.62]No, I'm not going to play Reaper.
[37:05.86]Stupid fucking idea was to play Reaper.
[37:13.94]She's just like, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
[37:16.25]Oh my god.
[37:16.97]Come through here.
[37:43.04]No, nobody there.
[37:52.39]No!
[37:53.13]Shit.
[37:53.75]They all saw me.
[38:02.74]Look at all those PogChamps.
[38:04.00]Look, I killed two people in one life.
[38:10.04]They still haven't gotten it.
[38:10.82]Holy shit.
[38:11.60]No, they did.
[38:14.56]That was probably the play of the game.
[38:17.50]I hope so.
[38:18.59]Otherwise I can't turn off the stream.
[38:25.15]Not good.
[38:26.09]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[38:26.99]Dead.
[38:27.35]No, I'm not.
[38:27.71]I'm alive.
[38:44.65]You've never played Diablo II?
[38:47.69]That's a fan- that's one of my favorite games ever made.
[38:49.19]If you've never played D2, I highly suggest you play it and its expansion.
[38:57.58]Both great games.
[39:05.10]Ah, I had one more shot maybe.
[39:10.95]I gotta like... Of course!
[39:16.62]Of course!
[39:19.14]Need help.
[39:20.52]No!
[39:41.11]Diablo II stream?
[39:41.97]Should I?
[39:42.23]That would be kind of fun, actually.
[39:48.09]But no, not now.
[39:50.21]Not for a while.
[39:55.29]That D.Va really wanted you dead.
[39:58.12]I wanted that D.Va dead.
[40:04.44]Now I'm not going to win that fight.
[40:12.81]Shit.
[40:19.55]My god.
[40:20.13]I was too focused on the other shit.
[40:23.49]I'll give you 100 bits to stream Diablo II at some point.
[40:25.79]I would love to.
[40:27.19]You don't have to pay me money to do that.
[40:31.13]I'll definitely do that at some point.
[40:35.23]No, that's it.
[40:37.61]Yeah, I'll give you play of the game.
[40:44.46]Where's my play of the game?
[40:47.74]Aww.
[40:58.39]We're playing another one.
[40:59.69]So, Chilled Soda, you're good for another one.
[41:05.98]Alright, what if I'm in a play of the game?
[41:07.54]You know what I mean?
[41:11.94]Does that still count?
[41:13.50]If I'm in the crosshairs, technically I'm in play of the game.
[41:19.12]Technically.
[41:28.26]Well, you got a silver.
[41:34.26]Thank you, uh, thank you, you boy, Jack.
[41:36.84]Robert Swagmonkey, Rosie Posey, 22, Robo Spike, Dango Slapper for 10 months.
[41:43.21]Corporal Cupcake.
[41:44.71]Lore997.
[41:46.27]What's going in the toilet?
[41:48.49]For five months.
[41:49.21]Marky Darky.
[41:49.93]Inty.
[41:50.83]Chicken N. Mr. Bumblebee Man.
[41:53.67]Bob132125.
[41:55.03]For ten months.
[41:55.71]Thanks a lot, dude.
[41:56.45]Johnny Kravat for nine months.
[41:58.84]Jerma, what do you do when you like a boy, but he doesn't like you back?
[42:02.82]Thanks.
[42:03.54]Here's also some money.
[42:06.60]Um... Well... Well, Kravat... I would say it's...
[42:12.36]Well, plenty of fish in the sea.
[42:14.34]If somebody doesn't like you, then... No.
[42:17.58]If you can't accept my worst, then obey your thirst.
[42:22.70]There's plenty of people out there for you.
[42:24.32]Don't worry.
[42:27.59]Okay, who do I want to be least embarrassed on?
[42:31.61]That's embarrassing.
[42:33.21]This might not be embarrassing.
[42:34.79]No, this is going to be embarrassing.
[42:37.39]It'll be embarrassing.
[42:38.31]Don't worry.
[42:39.05]Trust me.
[42:42.81]MajorBluetooth, thanks for two months.
[42:44.31]Prenn, thanks for four months.
[42:47.85]Any upcoming games you're waiting to come out?
[42:49.19]Yeah.
[42:50.05]The last... Jesus, what the hell is happening?
[42:54.15]The Last Guardian.
[42:55.34]I'm going to stream that on the 6th.
[42:58.04]That's when it comes out.
[42:58.86]That's when it launches.
[43:00.60]That's a game I'm heavily looking forward to.
[43:04.54]Thanks also to Wiresponge, Hbrown, MC Peruna, SirGrey...
[43:11.24]Thanks for the multiple months in a row for you guys.
[43:14.17]Much appreciated.
[43:14.79]Alright, what's the strategy here?
[43:18.59]I bet you guys didn't know about this one.
[43:24.93]See?
[43:25.77]Yeah, I didn't fucking know about that one.
[43:27.31]Because then when they come around here, I go like... And I get the guy right in the fucking head.
[43:32.34]Did you know about this one?
[43:35.54]That's a little harassing fire.
[43:36.68]You didn't know about the harassment.
[43:37.78]You know about this one?
[43:39.72]You block the door.
[43:47.62]Watch this one.
[43:48.00]Ready?
[43:48.46]Bang.
[43:48.92]They can't shoot me.
[43:54.75]Alright, it's already dead.
[43:55.35]We're good.
[44:04.66]Nope.
[44:06.54]I'm taking this.
[44:07.08]I don't want to take it.
[44:19.93]I'm a distraction.
[44:26.13]Thank god I did that in the right time.
[44:29.22]Although I kinda don't know what the hell's happening around me.
[44:32.22]I just took a little nap, it's alright.
[44:45.86]No, not this time.
[44:56.37]WN1 Mei.
[44:58.95]Am I feeling tired?
[44:59.77]No, I'm awake, man.
[45:00.72]I'm ready to go.
[45:08.38]Pro Mei?
[45:08.88]Well, I do have the legendary skin, so that means I'm good enough, right?
[45:16.45]What the fuck?
[45:18.17]Okay.
[45:18.69]Okay.
[45:23.63]Where is it?
[45:24.55]Oh, come on.
[45:25.27]Really?
[45:26.63]Really?
[45:26.91]I was already standing still.
[45:33.56]Holy shit.
[45:37.24]That damage boosted Genji.
[45:38.48]That's like the most nightmarish thing in the world.
[45:48.11]Tactical sleep.
[45:48.75]Yeah, I was standing completely still.
[45:50.07]It should make me stand still even longer.
[45:57.78]I wouldn't be so rusty if I stayed inside when it was raining.
[46:01.67]I'm like the Tin Man.
[46:02.43]Another couple games and the rust should shake off me at least a little bit.
[46:16.10]At least a small amount of rust will come off my body.
[46:30.85]Where'd he go?
[46:31.17]Where'd he go?
[46:31.45]Where'd he go?
[46:32.69]He's still back here.
[46:34.17]He's still wrapping around.
[46:35.25]Oh, you do.
[46:40.09]Come over here.
[46:42.29]Where'd he go?
[46:59.42]Aww, that wascally wabbit.
[47:00.96]I think we're doing okay.
[47:09.00]Hey.
[47:12.34]I wanna get up there.
[47:15.70]No.
[47:17.24]Oh well.
[47:20.63]And he's the one that fucking killed me!
[47:25.93]I knew I was going to get killed by that guy.
[47:27.33]I just knew it.
[47:27.77]I had a very strong feeling.
[47:33.89]That Roadhog just threw his PC out the window.
[47:39.53]I got killed by this Mei and it was Jerma?
[47:42.81]Oh my god.
[47:43.76]I might as well just fucking never play again.
[47:54.93]Hey, we did it!
[47:56.31]Where's my play of the game?
[47:57.75]Where's my no medals?
[48:03.64]I wouldn't laugh my ass off if I get a play of the game that's terrible.
[48:06.98]I can't wait, it's gonna happen.
[48:10.49]These are actual viewer games, yes they are.
[48:17.49]Anybody killed by a Jerma has to sell their computer.
[48:21.23]That doesn't sound fair.
[48:24.12]Alright, now we're going to do a sub game.
[48:26.72]So I figured the easiest way to do this is just to make it sub only mode for a minute or two so we can get subs.
[48:33.21]Then I'm going to go back to just straight up random viewers.
[48:37.25]But thanks for playing, guys.
[48:39.55]Much fun.
[48:40.31]Very much fun.
[48:41.03]No medals.
[48:42.65]Only three deaths, though, but the career average is two.
[48:46.16]Did some healing.
[48:48.30]I did hurt some people.
[48:54.96]Oh, no, I want to play a custom game.
[48:58.18]Alright, let's get some subs in here.
[49:01.20]This is on US servers.
[49:04.44]Make sure you're actually in the game.
[49:06.38]And mods again, if you could help me out, that would be fantastic.
[49:13.37]And then once this is over, once we get through his turn off sub only mode, please.
[49:25.36]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[49:53.95]Trader Joe.
[49:56.17]I like that name.
[50:01.33]Yeah, turn on hero limits again.
[50:02.69]Thank you for reminding me, Flutter.
[50:05.08]Because I probably would have forgot to fucking do that.
[50:07.46]So thanks.
[50:12.30]Remember, make sure you're in the game.
[50:13.42]Make sure you're giving your correct capitals and everything battle tags.
[50:18.48]And make sure you're in the menu.
[50:20.56]Otherwise, it's not going to work.
[50:23.22]Yeah.
[50:31.18]Alright, so in like seven hours when I still don't have a play of the game, we're going to do a sub-only game and you guys have to all stand still while I rocket barrage everybody on the team.
[50:39.00]And then we can play normally.
[50:41.08]You guys didn't think I had a plan to get out of this if I don't get play of the game?
[50:48.16]Yeah, well that's where you're wrong.
[50:54.67]What did I have for breakfast?
[50:55.45]I had a yogurt with honey.
[50:58.21]Greek yogurt and honey.
[50:59.65]It's very good.
[51:00.15]I highly recommend it.
[51:01.15]Highly suggest it.
[51:07.01]Three more.
[51:20.72]Two more.
[51:21.70]And then we'll do another viewer game.
[51:25.04]Any viewer.
[51:29.59]And then the final one, Noodles.
[51:33.37]Hope you accepted, Noodles.
[51:34.63]You did.
[51:35.55]Alright, now let's turn this shit on again.
[51:37.95]Fuck Anubis.
[51:38.83]I never want to play on that map ever again.
[51:41.75]One hero for team.
[51:42.77]Save it.
[51:44.25]And alright, just waiting for Noodles.
[51:49.35]How should I feel knowing Jeremy was the same SR in season one as me?
[51:54.38]Played the game a lot back in season one you gotta come on I'm not that bad right I had like a 65 or something like I like played the game Why is everybody so fucking mean to me?
[52:10.38]I don't understand.
[52:14.11]No, I don't play on Hollywood again, or do we do I care?
[52:17.37]No, I don't care
[52:22.71]Look, I never, like, 65 is what I consider, like, you're good enough.
[52:27.53]Am I a 66 player?
[52:28.81]Absolutely not.
[52:29.35]Am I a 70 player?
[52:30.47]Absolutely not.
[52:34.41]I'm okay with a D+.
[52:38.87]You're pretty bad.
[52:39.75]Alright, whatever.
[52:43.92]Now I'm gonna play some Zenyatta.
[52:51.68]You guys remember the diaper stream?
[52:52.73]I was like... Do you remember how well I played to make sure I didn't put a diaper on?
[52:58.91]Go back and like watch a stream from like four months ago when I played this game.
[53:04.23]Guarantee you'll be like, holy shit, dude.
[53:07.44]Alright, let's just pretend like these guys are all enemies and like we're talking season one.
[53:11.94]Dead.
[53:13.68]Then I would turn the corner.
[53:16.62]There's the four guys on their team.
[53:19.22]Say I wouldn't have shot right there.
[53:20.12]Don't want to give my position away.
[53:21.98]Dead.
[53:22.52]Headshot.
[53:24.10]Dead.
[53:24.50]Got that guy in the head.
[53:26.54]There's three more.
[53:27.18]There's Torbjörn, Junkrat.
[53:29.38]Missed that one, but dead.
[53:31.22]Dead.
[53:33.52]See?
[53:36.56]Watch this jumping shot, too.
[53:37.70]I would have got this, too.
[53:38.52]Watch when the Reinhardt jumps off.
[53:40.30]We'll see.
[53:50.03]Alright, let's do it.
[53:50.71]Let's see if I can play this character.
[53:52.31]This was like my favorite character back in the day.
[53:54.70]You know, back in the day.
[53:55.68]This is the guy I play the most.
[54:01.16]I'm gonna get a play of the game of Zenyatta right now, and I'm gonna actually get it.
[54:05.11]I'm gonna be fucking nuts right now.
[54:18.58]I gotta be quiet though, that's important.
[54:21.88]Silence.
[54:24.23]Once I have total silence.
[54:26.93]Oh, he's dead.
[54:38.12]I got you, I got you.
[54:39.04]What the fuck?!
[54:43.20]That guy just got me through the drywall.
[54:47.43]What?
[54:48.65]That didn't happen.
[54:49.39]I was like on the other side of the fucking... What?
[54:52.73]I was standing in front of the Torbjörn.
[54:56.39]Fucking 20 click rate.
[55:07.46]Oh lord.
[55:14.84]God, dick rate.
[55:20.86]How disgusting would you say dust is?
[55:22.42]What do you mean dust?
[55:23.08]Like the actual physical dust?
[55:25.70]Adversity is an opportunity for change.
[55:29.13]Objective lost.
[55:30.49]Yeah, dude, the reason why that happens is for the fucking stupid ting rate.
[55:41.92]Gotcha.
[55:42.80]I have an ult here.
[55:43.44]I should probably use it.
[55:45.88]Yeah, let's just go.
[55:46.60]Go!
[55:46.84]Let's go!
[55:47.22]Experience tranquility.
[55:59.98]I shouldn't have done that.
[56:04.75]That was a mistake.
[56:07.03]Hold on.
[56:08.43]Give me one second.
[56:21.23]I think Jerm is being targeted.
[56:22.72]Am I?
[56:24.66]Can I make myself feel better by saying that?
[56:28.26]Oh, line of sight.
[56:29.04]Come on.
[56:31.05]I have no idea where the hell he is, but I'm scared regardless.
[56:37.47]Oh, boy, they're being revived.
[56:58.57]I got you.
[56:58.95]I got you.
[57:01.77]Oh, fuck.
[57:02.59]Oh, not good.
[57:03.53]Not good at all.
[57:04.21]Bad.
[57:04.70]Very bad.
[57:08.18]That's my chance.
[57:29.79]Get that!
[57:46.26]Fuck me!
[58:02.28]I'm doing better on Zenyatta than I was on any other character.
[58:07.51]Because I'm terrible at doing ultimates.
[58:17.40]I think he's like one hit too.
[58:21.08]Where'd he go?
[58:26.42]Shit.
[58:28.37]It's okay.
[58:29.39]I had him with the orb of... Orb of Dishumanity.
[58:32.97]What is it called?
[58:33.65]The Orb of Destruction.
[58:35.11]No, the Orb of Calamity.
[58:37.55]The... What is it called?
[58:41.89]The Silent Orb.
[58:42.61]What the fuck is this thing called?
[58:44.29]Why can I not know what this is called?
[58:45.43]The Orb of...
[58:47.17]Discord Discord Discord Discord Discord God Watch this one That would have been cool if I got it I got it
[59:17.64]Drop down here.
[59:18.60]Drop down here.
[59:19.54]Monkey.
[59:22.19]Monkey.
[59:28.41]Stay alive.
[59:32.51]Ooh.
[59:32.87]Come on, Ana.
[59:49.59]The orb of ouchies.
[59:51.23]Yeah, that's pretty much what it's called.
[60:00.74]Fucking god damn ting rate.
[60:02.00]That's why I was losing earlier.
[60:06.25]That blizzard like upgraded their servers like 10 minutes ago.
[60:08.53]That's what happened.
[60:30.53]Orb of ouchies.
[60:32.17]He bounced that right off my back.
[60:33.59]That's bullshit.
[60:34.25]I'm mad at a metal.
[60:36.04]The hook should not work on Zenyatta, because I'm mad at a metal and the hook is metal, so it just bounces off me.
[60:45.66]No, don't die.
[60:47.20]Come on, I can see you.
[60:48.26]Why can I not get you with this?
[60:54.02]See you later.
[61:02.76]Got another ult.
[61:03.66]That quickly?
[61:04.22]Didn't I just do it?
[61:05.04]Stay alive, please.
[61:05.74]Ah, they're going all the way around.
[61:32.19]Where's that high noon?
[61:33.05]I don't know.
[61:36.45]They're still behind us.
[61:37.71]Yeah, they are.
[61:38.25]Watch out, watch out.
[61:39.05]Woohoo!
[61:48.69]Somebody got hit by the frisbee!
[61:51.53]That frisbeed!
[61:59.27]Careful to everyone in this.
[62:00.53]No man's land.
[62:04.10]Got it.
[62:06.28]Alright.
[62:12.98]That was good.
[62:13.40]Where's my play in the game?
[62:18.13]Let's see it.
[62:20.83]God damn it.
[62:21.35]I still have to keep my stream on.
[62:23.43]Alright.
[62:31.36]Does he get like three people with this?
[62:35.06]Yeah, that was good.
[62:36.18]That was good.
[62:36.82]That was good.
[62:40.66]That was game one.
[62:44.18]See, let's play the game.
[62:45.45]Right?
[62:45.71]Are you just voting for me to make me feel better?
[62:53.09]I hope so.
[63:05.75]Round two.
[63:10.95]I would give you the play of the game if I could.
[63:16.46]Let's get a cue of the game with our good friend Reaper.
[63:34.41]A good buddy of Reaper, why not?
[63:41.35]Hey, Anne, thanks to Lonely10101, LostWaffle, Mangote, TallLucario.
[63:48.53]TallLucario was nine months, by the way.
[63:50.53]Thanks, dude.
[63:51.80]MintyMeach, SwellFoop, I11 for two months, Johnro89, FemalesJesus for nine months.
[63:58.86]I'm naming the baby Flanker.
[64:01.08]It's a good name.
[64:03.84]Thanks a lot, guys.
[64:11.98]Thanks a lot.
[64:13.00]There was some bits given too, wasn't there, that I missed?
[64:16.08]Thanks for the bits.
[64:18.45]Yeah, Todd gave 400 bits.
[64:20.97]That was the breakfast question.
[64:23.33]You gave 420.
[64:24.75]I spent the rest of my bits to make a dumb weed joke during sub only mode.
[64:29.95]Are you proud?
[64:30.68]Yeah, sure.
[64:33.32]I'm proud of all my children.
[64:36.98]I'm proud of all of my children.
[64:40.30]Alright, let's get a play of the game.
[64:50.22]Get out there quick.
[64:50.82]That's a tip for all you Reapers that are not as good as a player as me.
[64:55.14]You gotta get up.
[64:55.82]Here's a tip for all you, like, Reapers that aren't as good at the video game as me.
[65:07.79]I'm gonna go up there, but there's a Mei up there.
[65:10.91]They're covered.
[65:11.61]Everywhere is covered.
[65:12.55]Alright, we're gonna go for it.
[65:14.66]I'm just gonna go for it.
[65:15.18]I'm gonna try to shoot her right in the fucking head.
[65:24.90]I'm gonna go, no.
[65:26.52]Screw it.
[65:30.06]No!
[65:30.78]I could've killed that Mei if I wasn't fucking awful at video games.
[65:47.93]I had that panic where I was like, she's gonna freeze me, she's gonna freeze me, she's gonna freeze me, she's gonna freeze me.
[65:52.73]And it fucked me up.
[65:54.29]Here's a quick tip for all you Reapers.
[65:56.85]Aim and shoot people.
[65:57.81]Don't miss them five times in a row.
[66:01.92]Who's left?
[66:10.36]Oh, thank you, Anna.
[66:11.82]Thank you.
[66:26.51]Look at all the orbs.
[66:27.81]The orbs of calamity on the ground.
[66:35.63]Shit.
[66:37.49]I could have had a... God damn it.
[66:42.15]Why do they keep changing that line?
[66:45.53]Is that like the third or fourth time they've changed the heroes never die line?
[66:50.47]My servants never die.
[66:52.21]What?
[66:57.77]Wasn't it like heroes never die, then they keep changing lines in this game?
[67:02.35]Alright, here comes my play of the game.
[67:08.48]I'm gonna get it.
[67:09.16]Just gonna wait till they all get in the right spot.
[67:24.73]This is it!
[67:25.53]This is it!
[67:27.19]This is it!
[67:28.59]This is it!
[67:29.05]This is it!
[67:29.41]This is it!
[67:33.03]Yeah!
[67:36.44]That's it!
[67:39.06]That's it!
[67:39.64]That's gonna be it!
[67:41.46]Yes!
[67:48.48]You all thought I wasn't gonna get away with it, did you?
[67:53.26]I thought I wasn't going to do it.
[68:06.13]Let's get out of there.
[68:09.33]Die, motherfucker, die.
[68:26.78]Shit.
[68:27.08]I should have known that was going to happen.
[68:30.51]Where the hell is the turret?
[68:46.25]Come on, do it.
[68:46.95]Do it.
[68:48.79]See if I can get it again.
[68:50.17]Let's give them two things to pick from.
[68:54.29]Whoops.
[68:54.57]Whoops.
[68:55.11]Whoops.
[68:56.05]Whoops.
[68:57.29]Whoops.
[68:57.85]Don't even need to do it.
[69:09.82]Who needs an ult when you can just go back?
[69:13.84]Back.
[69:20.60]Let's get on it.
[69:26.00]Cap it, quick!
[69:28.10]Yeah!
[69:28.78]Nice job.
[69:31.07]What is this, a morning stream?
[69:35.59]Okay, if that wasn't play of the game.
[69:39.99]Yes!
[69:47.25]That was that guy, he knocked me up here.
[69:48.81]It's perfect.
[69:55.79]Why must you spin?
[69:57.66]Everyone's gonna vote for that.
[70:03.54]Alright, give me a legendary.
[70:05.28]Give me a legendary card.
[70:10.04]Best Beyblade NA.
[70:14.66]Thank you specifically for the 500.
[70:16.26]You did it!
[70:16.76]I did do it.
[70:18.72]Thank you, Minxie.
[70:19.44]Minxie, did you sub, like, twice?
[70:23.31]You subbed last night, and then you subbed, like, right now.
[70:25.77]Well, thanks.
[70:27.19]Very much appreciated.
[70:27.92]Alright, let's go back to... Uh, thank you for playing, guys.
[70:32.32]Let's go back to, uh, random viewers.
[70:36.74]After two more random viewer games, we'll do, uh, another sub-only game.
[70:44.31]So, mods, if you could, bring in some viewers.
[70:47.29]Viewers?
[70:49.81]Please make sure you are in the game.
[70:51.21]Please make sure you also have the correct battle tag and you are actually in the menu.
[70:55.53]Otherwise, you're not going to be able to get invited to the game.
[70:59.04]Okay.
[71:09.20]Limeade6.
[71:10.41]Okay, I got that.
[71:11.15]I know that guy's name.
[71:13.61]Although I can't copy and paste that for some reason.
[71:15.39]But let's just type it in.
[71:25.59]Thank you, Loose Cannon, for the 500 bits.
[71:27.61]Oh, that was wrong.
[71:37.22]Alright, let's start inviting people.
[71:55.29]Make sure you're in the game.
[71:56.77]By the way, spelling counts.
[71:59.87]Capitals count as well.
[72:02.11]Of course spelling would count.
[72:04.11]You know spelling counts, guys.
[72:06.27]On your battle tags.
[72:07.90]I believe capital letters are important as well.
[72:15.06]Getting a lot of dings.
[72:27.30]Like a shitload of dings.
[72:31.74]Quit dinging me.
[72:36.82]Let's go back to this list here.
[72:45.16]Yeah, another big thanks to the mods right now because this would have been very difficult for me to do on my own.
[73:06.52]Get some more peeps.
[73:10.02]Four more.
[73:10.54]I already got that guy.
[73:16.59]What about this guy?
[73:20.25]Hey, that's funny.
[73:21.17]I literally just copied your name.
[73:24.57]Oh, come on.
[73:25.03]You just sent me like an invite.
[73:26.23]That guy just invited me.
[73:27.02]Come on, Marky.
[73:29.34]Oh, no.
[73:29.86]Alright, you're getting one more try, but I feel like your first letter is capitalized.
[73:35.19]No!
[73:36.45]Oh, well.
[73:36.85]Sorry, dude.
[73:42.11]No!
[73:46.93]No, whoops.
[73:49.91]Alright, three more.
[74:01.17]Two more.
[74:05.59]I'll try this one.
[74:11.37]One final person, and we can go on.
[74:13.67]Let's do this one.
[74:14.53]Milk Tea.
[74:17.98]Hey, look at that.
[74:19.76]Settings.
[74:20.66]Anubis is off already.
[74:23.20]One per team.
[74:23.92]Okay, good.
[74:26.26]And Route 66 it is.
[74:27.22]Let's get going.
[74:28.68]Thanks a lot, guys.
[74:41.39]Who should I play?
[74:49.87]I'll get embarrassed.
[74:53.49]I already got embarrassed on.
[74:55.07]Who am I not going to get embarrassed on?
[75:00.73]I guess I could try, soldier.
[75:03.39]He's the one guy that I'm not 100% confident that I won't be embarrassed, but I won't be 100% confident that I will not be... Western Pennsylvania is the most patriotic drug place in the entire country.
[75:17.22]You know what I mean.
[75:19.88]Tell me what's wrong with Anubis?
[75:27.84]I fucking hate that map.
[75:31.43]I despise Anubis.
[75:33.23]Anubis might be my least favorite map that's ever been made in an FPS.
[75:39.04]What am I talking about?
[75:40.98]Somebody's gonna get it.
[75:42.14]Somebody will get that.
[75:43.40]If you don't get it, then, sorry.
[75:46.85]But somebody will understand what that was.
[75:49.31]Someone will.
[76:01.13]I hate Anubis.
[76:02.45]That map sucks.
[76:04.61]Let's be honest.
[76:07.50]I've hated, let's be fair, I've hated that map for like two years.
[76:12.34]When I was in the closed beta, I was like, this map is fucking terrible.
[76:17.22]And it stuck with me the whole time.
[76:19.64]I've never liked it, even after they improved it, in quotes.
[76:26.09]Almost got me.
[76:42.13]You can stay there.
[76:42.59]I'll heal you.
[76:42.97]Where?
[76:47.59]Where?
[76:52.49]Almost.
[76:52.97]I should have... Oh, she jumped over it.
[76:56.79]Good jump, man.
[76:57.81]Good jump.
[77:04.75]Awful.
[77:05.01]Fucking awful.
[77:05.91]Awful.
[77:06.17]What an awful display of playing a video game.
[77:10.23]Does this happen to anybody else?
[77:13.10]Do you, like... Holy Macintosh, thanks for doing this.
[77:16.65]Can you take my bits?
[77:17.93]Well, thanks, holy.
[77:20.79]What's going on, dude?
[77:21.91]Hope all is well.
[77:22.59]Yeah, it's fun to do viewer games, but... My hands, right?
[77:29.28]Does this happen to anybody else?
[77:30.32]When you're playing a game like this and you're supposed to track somebody, when you start to do it, like, the track, let's say, for instance, okay, I get to shoot, like, this guy.
[77:39.97]Like, track, track, track, track.
[77:41.19]And then, like, my hand does this thing where I grip too hard on my, like, ring finger.
[77:47.89]And I can't do it.
[77:51.07]Like, the point where my thumb and my ring finger just start squeezing tighter than they should and I, like, get frozen.
[77:59.20]Fucking bullshit.
[78:00.52]Get new hands.
[78:01.90]Chop these ones off and give me fucking Zenyatta hands.
[78:05.34]I don't like these anymore.
[78:06.72]When's that gonna be a possibility, by the way?
[78:10.25]Talking about shit that annoys us.
[78:11.35]I mean, like, Temple of Anubis sucks.
[78:12.85]I hate Temple of Anubis.
[78:13.81]When are we gonna be able to get fucking robot hands?
[78:17.99]There's more shit that annoys me, you know?
[78:25.12]It's dangerous to be in there with her.
[78:31.60]Oh, come on.
[78:32.12]I thought she wasn't even over here yet.
[78:38.92]Ring finger fucked up.
[78:40.04]I still got it.
[78:44.30]Oh, come on.
[78:44.98]Just give me my ult.
[78:47.35]Give me the ult right now.
[78:48.69]Right now.
[78:50.17]Right now.
[78:50.91]I need it right now.
[78:51.65]Give me the 1%.
[78:51.93]God damn it.
[78:53.21]Well...
[79:10.47]At least I did something, right?
[79:13.01]That's all I can be happy about.
[79:14.07]Fucking ring finger.
[79:19.31]We're getting off that character.
[79:33.87]I just read something in chat that was extremely inappropriate, but it made me fucking laugh.
[79:42.37]can't repeat it that was fucking terrible packet which way is he going who know where is he where's the spy where's the spot
[80:16.66]Ooh, yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy, I've been spotted.
[80:46.83]Get out of there, fuck!
[80:48.06]I feel like I could have made something happen if I was there for one more second.
[81:00.70]Pretty sure nobody gets banned except for rule breakers and spam bots.
[81:03.96]I don't really have chat rules.
[81:07.90]The only rule that exists in this chat is just don't be a fucking psycho.
[81:10.65]You know what I mean?
[81:16.97]Just don't be a psychopath.
[81:20.15]We're pretty lenient around here.
[81:21.39]Play of the game.
[81:25.80]Just don't, like... Something that you wouldn't say on the radio.
[81:29.86]Right?
[81:31.12]I guess no, that doesn't make sense.
[81:32.08]Because you can say, like, fuck you in this chat.
[81:33.88]If you really wanted to.
[81:34.68]Like, if you really wanted to, you can say right now.
[81:37.38]To me.
[81:38.18]In this chat.
[81:39.40]Fuck you, this streamer sucks.
[81:42.49]You're not gonna get in trouble for it.
[81:44.99]I'm gonna be like, well, okay.
[81:48.19]Whatever.
[81:49.05]Like, what the fuck?
[81:51.87]You can't say that, but that's not allowed on the radio.
[81:58.80]Just, you know what I mean?
[81:59.40]That's the shit that you wouldn't say in front of your grandmother.
[82:03.24]You wouldn't say fuck you to your grandma either.
[82:08.63]Stuff that your dog, no, your dog doesn't understand you.
[82:15.07]Select your hearing.
[82:28.38]Let's go back to Zenayata.
[82:30.94]I feel like I was doing good on Zenayata.
[82:35.28]What have you done?
[82:38.34]Thank you, Nano.
[82:40.00]Argos533, it was the aliens.
[82:44.12]Thanks, you guys.
[82:45.86]Welcome to the channel.
[82:47.08]Welcome to the sub-team.
[82:49.58]And then we had some bits.
[82:50.72]We had X10 and X. We need a coffee emote..
[82:55.13]Maybe eventually it would be not a bad idea.
[82:58.62]Coffee, coffee, coffee.
[83:01.94]But thanks for the 10 bucks dude, appreciate that.
[83:09.71]I don't like to... Look.
[83:14.95]Just don't be a psycho.
[83:16.26]Just don't be a fucking sociopath.
[83:20.07]I don't care if you write, like, I'm Jeff from Psychology 101.
[83:22.53]Just don't do it 30 times.
[83:24.31]Like a psycho.
[83:25.01]You know what I mean?
[83:27.79]Tell me to go fuck myself.
[83:28.79]But don't be a psycho about it.
[83:30.73]Nothing like...
[83:39.85]Obviously, shit that's not cool.
[83:43.07]Don't say it.
[83:43.91]If you sit there in your chair and you're thinking, I'm gonna write this, this is fucking not cool.
[83:49.44]Then, don't do it.
[83:52.60]That's it.
[84:04.76]Okay, I gotta stop talking now.
[84:06.28]I'm gonna get myself in trouble.
[84:13.17]That would have been play of the game if I killed that person.
[84:26.79]That riddle asked?
[84:28.15]What riddle?
[84:31.59]No, I'm trying to heal him.
[84:35.39]A lot of people need heals.
[84:41.36]Who's even in here?
[84:42.50]Did you get him?
[85:01.79]Come here, you.
[85:02.41]I'll get you.
[85:09.74]Nice job.
[85:11.10]I would have had it, but nice job.
[85:16.08]Yeah, just not cool.
[85:18.12]Shit that's not cool, don't write it.
[85:19.94]We all know what that is.
[85:20.81]We don't have to pretend to know what that is.
[85:23.95]We all know what that is.
[85:28.35]He's still alive.
[85:41.44]And no, don't even need to use it.
[85:42.66]We're fine.
[85:43.12]Maybe I'll use it right... No, don't even do it.
[85:49.67]I thought he was going to go around the corner.
[85:57.25]Nope, apparently not.
[86:00.98]Let's just do it.
[86:01.94]Fuck it.
[86:14.14]Shit, I knew I was going to die.
[86:16.52]Sling those orbs.
[86:17.40]I'm trying.
[86:17.78]I'm trying to sling.
[86:20.58]Is it working?
[86:23.83]Who knows.
[86:25.09]Am I doing some good slinging?
[86:32.21]Let me just change the audio a tad.
[86:34.64]It's a little too loud.
[86:36.50]I almost just clicked a leave game.
[86:37.72]Hopefully that didn't... Okay, I'm good.
[86:45.29]I'm the least cool person in the world.
[86:46.61]You're basically telling me to never speak.
[86:50.79]No.
[86:52.35]Talk all you want.
[87:02.58]Do it in every orb.
[87:04.67]With the Orb of Harmony on it.
[87:06.51]Orb of Harmony.
[87:08.75]Discord Orb.
[87:12.59]Oh, okay, to remember that, I just need to remember that the thing that chat program that everybody uses that I don't use.
[87:21.62]Shit, I didn't put a node on him.
[87:22.56]Oh, well.
[87:24.97]Oh, back up, back up, back up, back- back- back- back- back- back! Ah!
[87:34.00]Right now this guy is just like: Jerma, what the fuck are you doing? Heal me man.
[87:37.00]I'm just like going back.
[87:47.33]Down the hallway.
[87:49.65]Didn't hit one person with that.
[87:51.81]Unbelievable.
[88:00.74]Almost have her ult.
[88:09.58]No, I got blocked out of that.
[88:11.42]What are you doing back here?
[88:18.59]Oh, come on, stay alive so I can just press Q and we can win.
[88:23.58]Come on!
[88:24.14]97, 98, 99!
[88:24.60]No shit, there's a freezy-freezy going on.
[88:27.88]We're good.
[88:28.76]Nice job.
[88:29.22]Nice job.
[88:47.44]Maybe I should start dropping bits.
[88:49.26]No, you don't do that.
[88:53.12]You're banned from bit dropping.
[88:59.00]I still exist.
[89:01.14]I think so.
[89:01.66]Let me check.
[89:05.69]Ow, fuck.
[89:06.73]Yeah, I'm still here.
[89:12.49]Give it to me.
[89:20.43]Alright, new batch of viewers.
[89:22.25]Thanks for playing, guys.
[89:26.11]New batch.
[89:27.43]That was two, right?
[89:29.36]Right?
[89:31.08]I think it was.
[89:34.72]Yeah, it was.
[89:35.90]Thank you for playing.
[89:37.90]I have to remove you all.
[89:40.00]Good work.
[89:40.46]Good job on both teams.
[89:41.52]You both are wonderful people.
[89:44.34]Let's get some new viewers in here.
[89:48.05]And I do go back to sub game.
[89:49.31]Next one's going to be a sub game after this one.
[89:52.57]Facecam, please.
[89:53.43]Facecam, please.
[89:54.65]No.
[89:57.26]You don't want to see my face.
[90:00.82]You don't.
[90:05.70]You do not want to see me.
[90:15.43]Alright, let's get some new people.
[90:17.11]Let's see here.
[90:20.95]Uh, you.
[90:23.75]Hello.
[90:24.93]Welcome.
[90:28.25]Uh, did I get this guy last time?
[90:30.69]I don't think so.
[90:40.68]Rum ham.
[90:43.90]Rum ham.
[90:47.41]Never trust a purple with a thousand bits, huh?
[90:48.91]Mod me or I'll crush your stream under a mountain of bits.
[90:55.00]I told you you're going to get modded by the end of the stream.
[90:57.34]But you have to like prove to me that you have what it takes to be a moderator.
[91:00.70]You know what I mean?
[91:01.98]Like, for instance, here's a quick question for you.
[91:04.66]Guy comes into the chat and says very specifically, this is the worst Overwatch stream I've tuned into in a year.
[91:13.06]What do you do?
[91:13.92]Do you ban that guy?
[91:15.26]Do you say, hey, excuse me?
[91:17.11]Or option number three is easy.
[91:22.05]Which one?
[91:24.19]What is it?
[91:25.57]I better get the right answer to this question.
[91:28.04]It's very important.
[91:32.56]How come I can't open up my Twitch whispers?
[91:41.54]You mawed that guy.
[91:43.58]I better get the right answer to this question.
[91:45.59]What the fuck?
[91:46.61]Stop!
[91:48.55]Shut up!
[91:51.75]Yeah, how come I can't?
[91:53.91]Shut up, dude.
[91:55.85]Keep accidentally redoing my stream.
[91:58.95]Fucking idiot.
[92:03.74]Did I try this guy yet?
[92:06.10]I don't know.
[92:09.01]You mod the guy for 10 seconds.
[92:12.61]The correct answer is none of the above.
[92:16.57]I wonder if he got it.
[92:17.37]I didn't even see it.
[92:25.22]I got Green Thomas.
[92:26.62]What about Sandman?
[92:27.76]Did I try this guy yet?
[92:37.62]Golden Lime.
[92:38.90]I think I tried this guy before.
[92:40.94]It didn't work.
[92:41.80]Try it again.
[92:43.28]Hey, it worked.
[92:49.01]Need four more.
[92:50.43]Let's try this guy.
[92:55.87]Raisin Bran.
[92:58.79]Raisin Bran Crunch.
[92:59.83]There you are.
[93:02.44]Cookie Monday.
[93:03.30]Does that mean you only eat cookies on Monday, or does that mean that Monday is a special day for eating cookies only?
[93:14.63]Baguette?
[93:19.53]Two more, and we'll be golden, and then we're going to do a sub game after this.
[93:24.49]What's going on here?
[93:25.59]Yeah, somebody just comes in the stream and is just like, what the fuck is happening?
[93:32.54]Let's get you in here.
[93:35.42]Let's get you in here, soup.
[93:39.88]One more person.
[93:41.83]One more person.
[93:42.97]One more person.
[93:45.07]You.
[93:48.87]Come on.
[93:49.77]Oh, I almost got it.
[93:56.64]Oh, it's too hard.
[93:57.22]I'm going to have to have a mod do it.
[94:02.20]Right when I try to, like, drag, like, it's just gone.
[94:08.54]Oh, I got one.
[94:09.78]I got one.
[94:10.16]I hope this person is in the game.
[94:19.91]No, maybe I didn't.
[94:21.47]Oh, no.
[94:21.77]Thank God.
[94:25.47]Got it.
[94:27.85]Alright, let's do it.
[94:29.49]Make sure the settings are correct.
[94:30.51]Yes, off.
[94:31.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[94:32.49]I didn't leave, so they would be staying the same.
[94:35.55]Numbani's fine.
[94:36.27]Thank you, guys.
[94:41.50]If you have better twitch.tv, you can just hold control.
[94:43.56]That's good to know, because if they don't have better twitch.tv, because I'm a scrub.
[94:50.64]But, let's get it going.
[94:53.34]Traveling to Numbani.
[94:56.68]Well, we have a minute here.
[94:57.85]Phelpsie97, thanks for nine months.
[94:59.89]It's 5.15 a.m.
[95:01.21]in Australia.
[95:03.51]That's very, very early or very late, depending on if you've gone to bed yet.
[95:06.41]I'm not sure, but welcome.
[95:07.40]Good morning from the great state of Australia.
[95:10.04]Australia is a country, but you know what I mean.
[95:15.70]Barney Stinsbro, thanks for the sub.
[95:16.98]Pineapple.
[95:17.25]Pineapple.
[95:19.18]Or Pine Ipple.
[95:20.66]Thanks for the sub.
[95:21.44]Itgoff for seven months.
[95:22.46]Sling those orbs.
[95:23.22]That was from last game.
[95:24.06]Tritanix for nine months.
[95:25.64]Psycho reporting in.
[95:28.17]Psycho.
[95:31.51]Don't be a psycho in the chat.
[95:32.97]You can be a psycho anywhere else.
[95:35.05]No, don't be a psycho anywhere else.
[95:38.39]Be a good guy.
[95:40.25]Be a good guy.
[95:44.91]You gotta be a good guy.
[95:47.97]He can't face Gann probably because he's naked as always.
[95:50.15]Well, actually, that's not true.
[95:51.41]I do... Today I am wearing clothes.
[95:53.81]I actually have clothing on today.
[95:54.89]I don't have any underwear on, though.
[95:57.70]That doesn't... Why am I saying that?
[96:00.26]Stop while you're ahead.
[96:03.52]Never touch the purple thing.
[96:04.18]Give a thousand bits again.
[96:07.22]Todd, thanks for the 500.
[96:07.90]You guys are fucking kings among men.
[96:13.96]Can I get out there before everybody gets really mad that I'm out there?
[96:17.95]Let's see.
[96:22.93]Yeah, right, Jerba?
[96:24.99]I don't think you know me very well, man.
[96:28.11]I'd say 8 out of 10 times I'm probably sitting here in socks.
[96:34.78]No, I'm not.
[96:35.30]That's... Like, why would I just be naked every time with just socks on?
[96:46.31]Oh, I just... Okay.
[96:54.02]Give me a bit so I can buy undies.
[96:56.74]I gotta do laundry.
[96:57.44]I fucking hate that, man.
[96:58.68]Here's the one thing that I'll give you.
[97:00.98]Here's another, like, life.
[97:01.70]Here's another tip.
[97:05.27]Have... Make sure when you buy a place... That your washing machine is in your bathroom.
[97:13.50]Inside the bathroom.
[97:15.26]Not downstairs in the basement.
[97:17.50]Not down the street or something.
[97:19.34]Make sure when you buy a place it's inside the bathroom.
[97:22.76]Then you can rip your clothes off and throw it right into the wash and get in the shower and stuff.
[97:26.34]It's perfect.
[97:26.82]It's unbelievable.
[97:29.34]Have I done anything this whole game?
[97:31.45]I've just been talking.
[97:35.13]Where the hell is she?
[97:39.77]There's people everywhere.
[97:40.83]I don't like this.
[97:45.24]The guys on the other team are too good.
[97:52.14]Oh, please kill him!
[97:53.96]Ayayay!
[97:57.61]Oh my fuck.
[98:04.54]I got that from Starz, uh, Go-Go- Oh, that does happen in that video, doesn't it?
[98:11.70]But here's the philosophy behind this, guys, is if you don't put clothes on, you don't have to wash them.
[98:18.37]You might think I'm crazy.
[98:19.59]It's not crazy.
[98:21.65]If you're not going somewhere, okay, if I, if I, let's say I'm going to, like, the drugstore, right, to buy some drugs, then, yeah, I'm gonna put pants on and a shirt on and a fucking jacket on, and then guess what?
[98:32.17]Later on that night,
[98:33.83]Well, the next day, that's going in the laundry.
[98:37.12]Because I have to wash it.
[98:39.08]You don't wash what you don't wear.
[98:41.06]So why wear something when you're not doing anything?
[98:47.10]Doesn't make any sense to me.
[98:53.00]Doesn't make any sense to me.
[99:00.80]Alright, I gotta pay attention now.
[99:07.13]No more dicking around.
[99:07.69]We're gonna get a play here.
[99:14.11]God, I can't wait to ult and then get off this fucking character.
[99:16.55]I hate this character.
[99:17.91]Why did I pick it?
[99:18.43]I don't know why.
[99:22.71]You save water?
[99:25.15]Look, I'm not saying don't clean yourself.
[99:26.34]Like, take a shower every day.
[99:27.30]Of course.
[99:28.42]That's what I'm... Don't... Dude, take a shower.
[99:32.10]But do you need to wear your clothes?
[99:33.88]I mean, have like a t-shirt on or something.
[99:35.54]But you could be in like underwear.
[99:39.22]Look, I'm here alone, man.
[99:42.12]I'm not going to offend anybody with my naked body.
[99:47.56]Oh lordy.
[99:48.68]Come on.
[99:49.78]Oh my god, I didn't get anybody.
[99:51.00]This is horrible.
[99:52.03]What an abysmal embarrassment.
[99:56.73]That's what I was talking about.
[99:57.47]I knew I shouldn't have played this character because I don't fucking play her well.
[100:00.17]And I hate this character.
[100:01.03]Why am I playing it?
[100:03.19]Lord, lord, lord.
[100:05.15]My lord.
[100:15.24]So I change to a character that I'm equally as bad at.
[100:18.28]Just kidding.
[100:26.74]Lord.
[100:27.18]Auto's an influence on you?
[100:31.26]What if somebody knocks on the door?
[100:32.08]No one's gonna knock on the door.
[100:33.08]Why would they knock on the door?
[100:33.88]Nobody has any reason to be here today.
[100:50.41]What the fuck just happened?
[100:51.31]I don't even understand.
[100:56.57]Did he hit me right in the fucking head?
[100:57.99]He just instantly killed me.
[101:01.33]Alright, look.
[101:06.67]Let's see where they are.
[101:16.36]Once I get an ult.
[101:16.90]I'm changing after I ult like the last time.
[101:27.35]What the hell are you guys... Ah!
[101:34.66]I think we lose.
[101:37.48]You will offend somebody no matter what you do.
[101:42.26]Well, as long as you're not a psycho, you won't have to really worry too much about that.
[101:46.23]I guess wearing no pants and... This was a fucking shit game, by the way.
[101:52.73]I need new CPU and motherboard?
[101:54.09]Come on, this is 60 FPS!
[102:02.81]Let's play Lúcio.
[102:09.92]You can't mess him up.
[102:12.64]Oh yeah, you can.
[102:13.22]I don't think you've seen me play Lúcio before.
[102:18.50]Look, this was skewed.
[102:22.12]These guys are all on a pro team together.
[102:24.26]Raisin Bran, LC Sandwich, and Link Light.
[102:26.02]These guys are on CVS Pharmacy.
[102:30.56]Yeah, we got Team CVS on.
[102:32.30]Okay.
[102:36.36]Did I sleep naked, too?
[102:37.40]I actually do not.
[102:44.27]I can't.
[102:45.09]It kind of grosses me out.
[102:50.85]Hmm.
[102:51.05]It's going to look like I'm going to get slam dunked on.
[103:06.21]Now we need some like beefy.
[103:07.17]Yeah, let's... I'll go... Alright, embarrassment part 200.
[103:19.88]Sleeping naked?
[103:20.70]No, I don't like it.
[103:21.40]It's too weird.
[103:22.90]Don't you feel like... Okay.
[103:25.64]3, 2, 1.
[103:25.78]Here comes like adult conversation.
[103:27.96]Okay.
[103:29.70]Adult conversation.
[103:31.50]So if you are under the age of 18, please leave.
[103:39.69]Okay.
[103:41.77]Alright, so, uh, when you're sleeping, if you sleep naked, fuck that, and here's the reason why I say that.
[103:47.74]If you... When you pull, like, the covers up over your nude body, I feel like I'm, like, I don't like how when it, like, touches my, like, I don't like how it, like, touches you.
[104:00.87]Because when you wear, like, underwear, you're like, oh, I'm protected by, like, my dirty covers and my, like, dirty bedsheets.
[104:07.77]Rolling around, like, leaving and, like, uh, leaving.
[104:10.23]Rolling around.
[104:12.09]Rolling around and, like, turning around until you fucking... Lying on your stomach and shit.
[104:16.01]Like, it's like, this is a dirty bed.
[104:17.91]I have at least protection on my crotchal area when I have, like, pants on.
[104:23.70]You can't say the word penis.
[104:26.72]I can't talk.
[104:27.36]Why did you do that to us?
[104:29.66]That's why we lost the game.
[104:30.36]Who did that?
[104:31.02]You?
[104:31.86]You did that.
[104:34.46]You really fucking banned the Mayfell life.
[104:42.67]Watch out for the fucking Jerma sons, they're coming in hot.
[104:44.91]Jerma son!
[104:51.73]Is that guy still alive?
[104:54.27]I don't believe that for a second.
[104:55.59]That was unbelievable.
[104:56.41]What happened there?
[104:58.75]Why is my bed dirty?
[104:59.57]It just is!
[105:00.81]Your bed's dirty too, everybody's bed is dirty.
[105:05.84]Think of how many times you wash your sheets, but how many times you actually sleep in that bed.
[105:12.57]Some of you guys I bet haven't changed your sheets in like at least two or three months.
[105:17.73]Be honest with yourselves.
[105:19.91]You really want to sleep naked?
[105:26.64]Great.
[105:29.78]Great.
[105:39.03]Two or three years.
[105:41.09]Alright, you got me.
[105:42.93]See?
[105:45.99]So then, if you think about that, it makes it a little less appealing.
[105:56.12]Not an embarrassment.
[105:57.28]Do I have any teammates?
[105:58.26]Where's my team?
[105:58.90]What do streamers usually say?
[106:03.64]They say... Okay, if I'm an Overwatch streamer, I say this, right?
[106:06.60]Where's my team, dude?
[106:10.60]Fucking Genji up too far.
[106:14.52]Behind me, behind the shield.
[106:16.68]Where's my team, dude?
[106:17.44]Dude, where's my team?
[106:22.42]Where the fuck was my team?
[106:23.24]Did I do it?
[106:26.72]Am I doing it right?
[106:36.06]This chat needs to clean their sheets.
[106:44.57]Get this Reaper!
[106:48.73]Why did I turn around?
[106:49.56]Ooh, almost bacon and egged him.
[106:53.52]That's why I don't play Reinhardt.
[106:58.06]You see?
[106:58.76]What happens when I play like a dumb fucking tank that I suck at?
[107:08.87]Getting carried.
[107:10.09]No, I have zero!
[107:16.22]This might be the worst I've ever done since I've installed this game two years ago.
[107:43.20]I'm so dead.
[107:43.98]I'm so dead.
[107:47.10]I knew it.
[107:47.70]I knew I was dead.
[107:48.42]Where's our healer?
[107:49.50]Where's the heals?
[107:56.35]My team is never with me.
[107:57.55]Never pushes with me.
[107:58.61]What do we have on our team?
[108:02.27]A Reaper?
[108:02.95]We have a Reaper?
[108:03.71]And then I have to punch my keyboard, right?
[108:20.36]God damn it.
[108:24.28]I boil my sheets in a sterile-aligned solution?
[108:29.28]That just ain't gonna work either.
[108:30.28]I gotta do something else.
[108:33.76]I'm gonna just, like, Junkrat and just throw shit over the fucking balcony.
[108:44.37]I fucking seriously re- Oh yeah, like, the traffic light blocked me.
[108:47.95]What are you doing over here?
[108:54.31]Hey, I hit him once.
[108:55.43]I'm happy about it.
[108:56.07]I bumped my fucking head.
[109:09.04]This is a bad game.
[109:11.98]Pretend like you just watched the game from like two games ago.
[109:16.79]He sucks at Junkrat.
[109:17.89]I don't suck at Junkrat.
[109:19.09]I just hit the stupid traffic light.
[109:23.12]And like the street signs that are spammed all over the whole map.
[109:25.66]Alright, you wanna fucking make fun of me now?
[109:29.08]Check this.
[109:29.58]I was about to leave the game.
[109:43.07]I was like seconds away from leaving.
[109:48.12]Get me out of this fucking nightmare.
[109:58.55]Fuck, shit.
[110:00.05]Yeah, watch this one.
[110:00.91]You guys want to, like, talk shit about me and how bad I suck?
[110:03.35]Watch this one.
[110:13.00]Check out this high-level Winston play.
[110:15.28]Watch out this high brain.
[110:17.70]High aim.
[110:19.68]Totally is a Winston main.
[110:21.66]What's that joke?
[110:25.18]Where's my healer?
[110:26.48]Where's my healer?
[110:38.28]High brain.
[110:39.75]Huge brain.
[110:41.57]Tons of aim.
[110:43.25]Best fucking Winston you've seen.
[110:45.91]In the planes.
[110:55.22]Huge brain.
[111:18.69]Give it to me!
[111:21.09]Oh boy, I'm back.
[111:21.67]I didn't get enough shit.
[111:28.91]You can lead us to the play of the game with Winston.
[111:34.74]I might have a chance to do something.
[111:39.97]It's high brain.
[111:42.09]Should I do a movie night?
[111:44.77]I see people talk about that sometimes and I never know what the hell it means.
[111:48.70]You can't like watch a movie on stream.
[111:59.34]Did I do anything?
[112:04.16]I'll stay on Winston.
[112:04.81]I feel like I'm doing more than I was doing the whole fucking rest of the damn game.
[112:09.71]So what, you just want me to queue a movie up at the exact same time?
[112:22.82]Ow.
[112:23.72]Ow.
[112:24.92]Ow.
[112:26.36]Ow.
[112:27.28]Ow.
[112:27.56]I didn't know he was still standing up there.
[112:32.81]I am using zap.
[112:33.51]Yeah, that's right.
[112:34.01]I'm using zap.
[112:38.58]Very high cerebral activity gameplay.
[112:42.81]High cerebral activity.
[112:48.53]Here's a push, right here.
[112:49.59]Everyone's here.
[112:51.19]We've got an extremely intelligent, high, large IQ Winston player here.
[113:00.31]Ah, made him pop his ult.
[113:01.57]I'm okay with that.
[113:04.49]I'm okay with that.
[113:05.37]Now they don't have an ult.
[113:06.77]Except that...
[113:10.90]Nevermind.
[113:13.74]There are sites where you can stream a movie and everyone can watch it on the same site, like Twitch?
[113:19.85]I shouldn't have solo-rezzed Jerma for a stupid joke.
[113:22.27]What are you doing over here?
[113:27.47]What?
[113:28.00]The fuck?
[113:30.52]I'm so confused right now.
[113:34.72]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[113:37.80]There's nothing happening here.
[113:43.47]Watch old YouTube videos?
[113:44.51]No, I don't want to watch old YouTube videos.
[113:51.21]Old videos?
[113:54.29]I'm not sure I'm totally into that.
[113:58.24]I'd rather watch like an old movie from like the 30s.
[113:59.72]Like an old monster movie or something.
[114:05.16]Here comes the fucking rocket barrage.
[114:06.88]I know it's coming.
[114:16.19]Get off!
[114:17.01]Get off!
[114:18.73]Get off!
[114:19.71]Get the fuck off!
[114:25.54]Why would that guy not get off?
[114:26.36]He was stuck in the fucking Christmas tree.
[114:38.13]Detective movie?
[114:40.29]Like, it came from planet Earth.
[114:42.09]Whatever some of those movies are called.
[114:47.28]Copyright issues for real movies?
[114:49.32]I think that public domain exists for at least some of the movies that were made in the 20s.
[114:53.96]Jesus.
[115:01.05]Nope, nothing I can do there.
[115:05.93]Good game.
[115:08.43]Good game.
[115:09.49]I didn't really do much that game.
[115:13.34]But, you know, that's what happens when you have Team fucking Walgreens.
[115:16.80]That's who I accidentally invited them.
[115:22.17]Turned my throat.
[115:24.23]I did not.
[115:24.83]I just wasn't good.
[115:25.61]There's a difference.
[115:33.38]There's a stark difference.
[115:36.58]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[115:45.29]Yeah, Team Walgreens versus Team CVS.
[115:47.05]I wonder who would win.
[115:51.01]None of us.
[115:51.89]We all lose.
[115:56.97]What was I playing when I played that good game where I got to play the game?
[116:02.93]Zenyatta.
[116:05.01]Alright, so let's do a sub game.
[116:08.62]17%.
[116:08.66]Holy shit, that's terrible.
[116:11.16]Now, that game didn't even count.
[116:12.75]I was talking to you guys about Citizen Kane.
[116:20.21]Alright, we're going to get a whole new crew in here.
[116:21.97]All subs.
[116:23.75]Please turn on sub only mode for about two minutes so we can get some subs.
[116:28.83]And again, try to only mods that are listening.
[116:32.24]Try to bring in just people that haven't played yet.
[116:37.38]If you could.
[116:43.01]17% accuracy.
[116:43.59]I'm just playing.
[116:44.61]I'm sorry you're not getting the high-level Winston play that you desired.
[116:51.35]I was talking about dirty sheets and stuff.
[116:53.74]Mine wasn't in the game.
[116:57.40]It will be now, though, because this is a sub game.
[116:59.46]This shit is like... I better show my subs that I'm fucking good.
[117:07.39]What?
[117:15.27]Wait, what?
[117:22.96]Did I get you already?
[117:24.14]I don't think so.
[117:27.98]Oh, that didn't work either.
[117:35.81]Your son is, oh.
[117:38.35]For a second I read that as like your actual son was sick.
[117:40.49]I was like, oh Jesus, dude.
[117:42.31]No, it was the Jupiter thing.
[117:50.07]Come on in.
[117:51.13]Sub game.
[117:53.35]Subscriber is right to know.
[117:55.59]We'll play this.
[117:56.09]We're going to go back to viewer games after this one.
[118:03.21]Thank you for your continued patience while we sort it out.
[118:10.39]Excuses are the nails that build the house of failure.
[118:14.03]Fifth grade English teacher.
[118:22.19]Your English teacher sounds like a psycho.
[118:24.89]And what did I tell you?
[118:27.43]No psychos.
[118:38.26]Alright, what else we got here?
[118:41.22]Swanky pants.
[118:46.93]And this guy...
[118:51.89]Oh, that person's in a game.
[119:02.48]And almost there.
[119:05.04]Cupcake.
[119:10.52]And Aranorth.
[119:11.80]Let's get Aranorth in here if he's available.
[119:13.88]Hopefully Aranorth is around.
[119:15.44]Oh, yep.
[119:15.92]Okay.
[119:17.68]Thank you for participating.
[119:22.10]We're going to keep this shit rolling.
[119:26.18]Make sure... I'm going to check this every time, although I know it should never... Numbani?
[119:29.84]I don't want to play Numbani again.
[119:31.08]Fuck.
[119:32.88]Hold on.
[119:36.78]There we go.
[119:37.21]Nepal's fine.
[119:38.11]Let's go.
[119:43.19]Alright, you can take it off of sub only.
[119:45.87]Put it on to... There we go.
[119:47.03]Thanks a lot, guys.
[119:49.53]A long time fan here.
[119:50.27]Quick question for you.
[119:51.19]When are you finishing your Minecraft series?
[119:59.05]You got me at that one.
[119:59.87]You did.
[120:00.13]I was like, oh, here comes a quest.
[120:02.80]No, Minecraft.
[120:03.92]Remember when you made like seven Minecraft videos four and a half years ago?
[120:09.08]When are you going to do that again?
[120:16.20]Do you plan on doing that anytime soon?
[120:18.35]Well, the answer is no.
[120:21.50]And let's go ahead and say, real quickly, thank you to AceTech09 for six months.
[120:26.50]ColossalWaffle, SirSandwich, SirVetches, and Phelpsy97.
[120:33.53]Did I get Barney Stins, bro?
[120:34.65]I don't think I did.
[120:35.23]But welcome back, guys.
[120:36.01]Thanks for the subs.
[120:37.99]And then thank you to Toddy.
[120:38.87]Toddy Knows, Todd.
[120:40.41]Good old Todd with the bits.
[120:43.55]Todd with $10.
[120:44.19]Thanks a lot, Todd.
[120:47.55]Graham Cracker Crust.
[120:50.39]I love that name.
[120:53.36]Thanks a lot, guys.
[120:55.84]Back to the games!
[121:00.64]To the games!
[121:06.22]So how is the stream quality?
[121:07.53]Am I dropping frames or anything like that?
[121:09.19]Or is it pretty smooth as silk?
[121:13.49]That ain't gonna happen right now.
[121:15.13]But I am gonna kill you.
[121:22.67]I am going to kill him.
[121:23.37]I am going to kill you.
[121:24.91]I told you.
[121:25.89]Even if I got fucking terrible.
[121:27.27]God, that would have been embarrassing if I didn't kill her.
[121:39.60]Fuck you, Volusia, with you.
[121:41.88]Miracle that I'm still alive.
[121:42.98]Don't ask me how.
[121:46.28]No, now I'm dead.
[121:48.72]Is it good?
[121:54.16]Can subs get in viewer games if they shout loud enough?
[121:58.46]Yeah, but... I'd like it to be a high amount of people that are not subs for the games coming up next.
[122:05.91]It was still embarrassing, it was.
[122:07.07]Alright, let's try.
[122:09.75]Let's go.
[122:11.15]I'm prepared.
[122:14.27]Someone coming in the door over here.
[122:15.39]Nope, I wasn't... I thought I was prepared, but I wasn't.
[122:26.87]What does it mean, fighting maze, where I fucking lose my goddamn mind and I get terrified?
[122:30.06]I'm so scared of being frozen.
[122:38.56]Just waiting for somebody to walk by.
[122:44.09]Nobody?
[122:44.39]What the hell's going on?
[122:50.23]That's certain death if I walk over here, but...
[123:03.07]Shit.
[123:03.99]Ah, I thought he was gonna walk all the way around.
[123:10.43]I get my red special boy star with this donation.
[123:14.00]Oh, we got a red, we got a red firework in the chat now.
[123:18.54]Well, thank you, Todd.
[123:19.26]That means you've given a hundred fucking dollars over the last, like, month or two.
[123:24.42]That's a lot of money.
[123:27.73]We won, I didn't do a fucking damn thing.
[123:34.34]It's up now.
[123:41.42]Hey, look at that.
[123:43.94]I killed a guy.
[123:47.96]It's updated now.
[123:49.78]Looks like it.
[123:51.04]That was kind of a roll.
[123:56.72]Stay.
[123:56.82]I'm going to stay here.
[123:58.70]Reaper, I'm not going to change.
[124:06.49]That's not going to be play of the game.
[124:07.61]That was not nearly as good as the other one.
[124:13.85]Yeah, I did walk forward and press Q. It's very easy to press because it is right next to W and I'm just walking forward so I can just press it.
[124:22.85]Alright, let's get at least 10 kills this round.
[124:29.28]Let's do something.
[124:31.00]Let's be useful as Reaper.
[124:32.16]Does that sound like a plan to you guys?
[124:39.15]Anybody right there?
[124:44.00]Anybody?
[124:44.26]Nope.
[125:08.90]Come on, shoot me once.
[125:09.84]Just shoot me once so I can pick this up.
[125:12.04]Oh, fuck.
[125:12.72]What was I doing?
[125:13.40]What are you thinking?
[125:16.06]Why did I not know this?
[125:17.08]I thought they were gonna go... All fucking five of them were gonna come in this room.
[125:21.56]I thought for certain they were all gonna walk forward.
[125:26.07]What a dumbass.
[125:31.91]I take full responsibility for how bad that sucked.
[125:54.61]Ah, he's so close!
[126:01.93]Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[126:06.82]Thank you for the heals.
[126:07.80]You're unbelievable.
[126:08.60]I could just turn around and press Q.
[126:18.82]In fact, that might be a good idea.
[126:19.94]Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[126:23.63]No, I'm not.
[126:28.79]Who's even on it?
[126:34.60]Oh, that guy got me with a double tap.
[126:37.30]Oh, hello, everybody.
[126:38.30]Oh, well.
[126:42.39]It was inevitable.
[126:48.88]Dude, you suck.
[126:50.40]Hey, I don't suck.
[126:56.10]I refuse to hold down tab, though.
[126:59.48]You must have just got to the stream.
[127:01.22]This game... I've got like 38 kills.
[127:03.89]Oh, come on.
[127:11.69]Really?
[127:12.75]Bullshit.
[127:13.79]I'm angry about that one.
[127:16.61]Right when I fucking walk up there.
[127:24.67]Double tap to cancel reload?
[127:26.35]No, it just burned in my brain that... That, like, if you melee, it goes faster when it actually just doesn't.
[127:38.96]Holy fuck!
[127:39.88]I was not prepared for that one, and I'm dead.
[127:42.70]I did not get prepared to go 100 miles per hour across the map.
[127:52.28]Okay, do what I'm supposed to do.
[127:54.61]38 and 2 now.
[128:02.93]38 kills in 38 games.
[128:04.83]No.

[133:16.91]What was he still doing here?
[133:18.19]It was waiting for me to teleport back.
[133:22.57]That guy was cheating.
[133:30.99]Gotta do the sound effect?
[133:31.99]No, I can't.
[133:32.81]I can't do it anymore.
[133:33.57]I'm not good enough.
[133:39.19]Fuck.
[133:39.95]Get out.
[133:40.51]Get out.
[133:40.87]Get out.
[133:41.66]Yeah.
[133:46.39]Where am I going, huh?
[133:48.20]Hack him!
[133:50.08]Alright, everyone got disabled right there.
[133:51.92]But I don't think it mattered.
[133:52.68]He's trying to cause something for my team.
[134:01.20]But we lose.
[134:01.98]Did we?
[134:02.62]I guess not.
[134:03.68]Still going.
[134:04.40]No!
[134:08.98]I saw... Don't scare me like that.
[134:10.76]I like Sombra.
[134:13.04]I like just running around being like a dumbass.
[134:15.52]It's kind of fun.
[134:17.48]Let me just... Oh, hey, rewind.
[134:19.06]Like, rewind that.
[134:19.76]Pretend like I didn't do that.
[134:23.97]Okay, let's start over.
[134:29.73]Surprise!
[134:33.40]Fuck.
[134:33.78]What am I doing?
[134:37.18]I've given up completely at this point.
[134:43.31]We're gonna lose.
[134:47.56]No, don't hack that.
[134:51.50]It's useless.
[134:58.01]So many fucking people here.
[135:11.38]God damn it.
[135:12.04]There's no one in that one.
[135:16.91]No medals.
[135:18.27]I suck.
[135:25.60]Streamer sucks.
[135:32.98]That body block.
[135:34.90]I thought I was trying to just teleport down there and teleport up and just keep it activated, but it wasn't going to work.
[135:40.48]You have to be good at the game to do that.
[135:44.81]No, you know, have a little confidence, Jeremy, okay?
[135:47.99]Have a little bit of confidence.
[135:50.61]I did what I could.
[135:52.67]And I tried, and I did okay.
[135:56.07]Talk up, not talk down.
[136:00.90]I did what I could.
[136:09.99]I'm gonna cry.
[136:11.20]Alright, back to the viewer games.
[136:13.90]Thank you, subs.
[136:14.90]I love every one of you wonderful people.
[136:19.98]I just removed myself.
[136:24.73]Back to the non-subs.
[136:31.93]Yup.
[136:32.39]Okay.
[136:33.75]Nice playing, guys.

[136:49.93]Otherwise it will not work, please.

[137:16.43]We got Mr. Bologna.
[137:21.11]How are you, Mr. Bologna?
[137:31.42]Oh, you weren't in the game.
[137:35.74]Blue Snow.
[137:36.92]Blue Snow.
[137:39.55]Let's get Blue Snow in here.
[137:41.34]Hi, Blue Snow.
[137:45.88]Welcome.
[137:48.18]Big spicy dad.
[137:52.06]Come on in.
[137:55.23]Nope.
[137:55.99]You are not ready to play.
[137:58.43]Sorry.
[138:00.81]My apologies.
[138:01.81]And if it is just like a connection problem...
[138:04.85]Sorry.
[138:06.25]But make sure you're in the game.
[138:08.60]Make sure you give me the right battle tag.
[138:12.14]You wonderful people.
[138:15.36]You're all wonderful people.
[138:16.50]By the way, Merry Christmas!
[138:18.42]Next month.
[138:19.35]Merry Christmas next month.
[138:21.27]Wanted to make sure I said that.
[138:22.11]In case I forget to say it in December.
[138:29.29]Happy Holidays.
[138:34.63]Hit chokers.
[138:40.45]Pyro doggy.
[138:41.69]Let's get you in here, pyro doggy.
[138:45.46]Nope.
[138:53.34]Cameron.
[138:55.30]Alright, come on, Cameron.
[138:57.22]Come on, Cameron.
[138:57.86]Yes.
[138:58.37]Yes.
[139:03.14]Yo, Merry Christmas.
[139:04.84]Mr. Sneak Man.
[139:05.72]I have to get Mr. Sneak Man in here.
[139:08.29]That's very important.
[139:11.27]And last one, let's get Todd in here.
[139:22.90]I think he's been wanting to play for a while now, so let's get Todd in here.
[139:27.86]If I could only select his fucking name.
[139:33.34]Hold on.
[139:34.74]1959.
[139:34.82]Okay.
[139:35.26]Hey, look at that.
[139:45.61]Alright.
[139:47.23]Volskaya's fine.
[139:48.25]Everything's fine.
[139:51.84]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[139:54.12]Let's get going.
[139:57.52]Traveling to Volskaya Industries.
[140:04.68]What do we got for a team?
[140:07.45]Level 61?
[140:08.79]Come on.
[140:09.71]You can't give me that much.
[140:11.67]Don't be that mean to me.
[140:12.51]I'm level 61.
[140:15.45]That's high, right?
[140:17.84]I don't have any of these extra fucking Campbell's Soup things.
[140:22.52]Sorry.
[140:23.98]I don't have the Chicken and Stars logo.
[140:32.32]Kind of want to play Sombra again.
[140:33.72]Even though I'm not that great with her.
[140:35.54]Still fun to play.
[140:39.64]No.
[140:40.34]Let's play something I haven't played.
[140:43.15]On the stream yet.
[140:46.55]Tracer is just Sombra 2.
[140:49.19]Or Sombra 1.
[140:54.31]Attacking.
[140:57.01]I could play Lúcio.
[140:57.65]I'm just going to play Lúcio.
[140:58.51]Fuck it.
[140:58.77]Who cares?
[141:04.03]This is gonna make you feel better.
[141:09.83]61 is not high.
[141:14.23]I don't like... First of all, I haven't played this game in a long time.
[141:18.92]Back in the beta.
[141:20.78]Here's my explanation as to why I'm only level 61.
[141:22.38]In the closed beta, I played this game like every single day.
[141:28.56]All day.
[141:30.89]And in Blade, when it came out of closed beta, every day.
[141:34.97]Once the game actually released is when I was like, oh, that was kind of fun, but I kind of want to do other shit.
[141:40.22]That's my only explanation for you.
[141:44.64]Hopefully you like that explanation.
[141:46.46]What the fuck are you doing back here, man?
[141:54.77]Get rid of the ice wall.
[142:04.84]Mmm, macho diva!
[142:12.36]Ow, shit, that hurt.
[142:17.69]How the fuck did you grab me?
[142:22.99]Overwatch isn't really a casual game, so I can't play it and have fun.
[142:27.77]I agree and disagree at the same time.
[142:33.20]I think Overwatch, to kind of compete, you have to really play all the time and be aware of everything and play competitive and all that shit.
[142:43.31]But if you just want to dick around and play like D.Va for like an hour, you can do that.
[142:46.83]There's plenty of modes to do that.
[142:54.87]I'm fucked here.
[142:58.19]So lucky.
[142:59.39]I just barely got it off.
[143:08.57]If you want to take Overwatch seriously, it's... Hold on.
[143:23.61]Hard to speak.
[143:24.37]Get in there, everybody.
[143:27.76]Hey, cool.
[143:33.12]Alright, what I was going to say is if you want to take Overwatch seriously, you kind of need to queue up with two or three of your friends and play competitive.
[143:42.51]This game promotes playing with more than three or four people in team-speak than if you just kind of play casually.
[143:51.49]But I still have lots of fun playing casually.
[143:52.95]I think quick play and all the things they've added in arcade mode are extremely important additions that I'm very glad to see.
[144:00.37]Because I find those modes to be more fun than actually playing the 6v6 Overwatch game.
[144:12.51]Let's move our way this way.
[144:14.29]What are we just going in?
[144:22.04]Apparently.
[144:22.56]Stay alive?
[144:35.18]We got it.
[144:35.54]Nope, not quite.
[144:36.20]I almost have my ult.
[144:39.20]Am I gonna stay alive though?
[144:40.20]Alright, when I fucking say it, I'm dead.
[144:42.72]Bullshit.
[144:47.51]Why don't I play this game with Star?
[144:50.45]One very, very easy answer to that question.
[144:53.75]Star plays this game very, very seriously.
[144:58.43]He plays like competitive.
[144:59.55]He's like a high level player.
[145:01.11]And if he queues with me, we would have to do just like dog shit games.
[145:07.79]Because I do not play to the level that he does and the amount of time that he does.
[145:12.95]That's why we don't like always queue up in Overwatch.
[145:16.01]Because he wants to play the game like hardcore, you know?
[145:19.37]Nothing wrong with that.
[145:20.01]It's just that's one of the reasons why.
[145:21.57]Alright, let's just do it.
[145:35.49]Get out of here!
[145:37.27]Get out of here!
[145:37.77]Are we gonna get it?
[145:45.83]Shit, did she kill like three of us?
[145:47.21]She did, didn't she?
[145:48.05]That sucks.
[145:50.03]We might still get it.
[145:56.28]Play arcade?
[145:56.84]Well, I mean, this is viewer games.
[145:59.30]Viewer games are a lot different than queuing up and playing Overwatch, like, trying hard.
[146:04.58]I mean, I'm still trying to win.
[146:06.53]I'm sure everybody else is too, but it's not... It ain't the same, is what I mean.
[146:12.47]Oh, you did not just do that.
[146:13.97]Everyone's gonna get me.
[146:24.67]Maybe at some point I'll, like, stream the arcade stuff.
[146:31.18]But I just got the itch to stream today as an off day.
[146:36.32]And Overwatch seemed like something fun to do.
[146:38.32]I guess I haven't played it in a long time.
[146:40.84]Check out some of the changes, try the new heroes and stuff.
[146:45.32]And on top of that, I can play with you guys.
[146:47.62]So why not?
[146:48.28]Seems like a win, win, win, win, win.
[146:51.76]Watch out for that.
[146:53.64]Oh, you're dead.
[146:54.12]Sorry, soldier.
[146:57.96]Jesus, my goodness.
[146:58.87]Fucking...
[147:09.50]Oh, my shoulder?
[147:10.71]What?
[147:18.97]Jerma makes excuses?
[147:20.17]What are you talking about?
[147:21.19]We're having fun playing viewer games.
[147:26.82]I'm the only one that dies from that.
[147:29.24]Fuck.
[147:38.29]We'll get it.
[147:38.59]This is the push we'll get it on.
[147:47.10]Everyone's got their ult here in a minute.
[147:54.98]Ooh, the bow.
[147:59.79]Watch out for the guy over here.
[148:00.67]No, please don't tell me you have your ult again.
[148:05.15]I would shit my pants if you do.
[148:07.23]Oh my goodness, thank you.
[148:11.76]I'm gonna have my ult and... Come on, just do it!
[148:31.27]Did I knock him away?
[148:32.16]At least I knocked him away.
[148:33.54]That's all I care about.
[148:34.28]Is that he's away from the team doing that shit.
[148:40.46]Well, still got like two of us.
[148:43.97]Come on, college boy!
[148:49.79]College boy!
[148:50.69]I might get off Lúcio here.
[148:54.26]We need some more like beef.
[148:57.60]We need some more beefcake, I think.
[149:05.79]We need some more cake!
[149:11.19]Where should I go?
[149:11.71]I don't even have any idea.
[149:23.82]Don't laugh.
[149:24.24]Somebody's laughed at me.
[149:25.00]I heard that.
[149:26.99]Maybe Pharah.
[149:31.55]Yeah, I'll go Pharah.
[149:32.81]Why not?
[149:33.35]Who cares?
[149:37.31]Run back and give him the speed boost.
[149:46.66]It was worth it.
[149:48.00]You want to go Pharah V Pharah?
[149:58.90]God damn it.
[150:00.06]What the fuck?
[150:05.96]I thought he was like behind.
[150:07.78]I have no reason for that.
[150:08.98]I just got my ass kicked.
[150:18.17]This ain't going well.
[150:20.11]I need an ult.
[150:41.72]Where the fuck is this Pharah?
[150:55.67]I'm just gonna camp this health back till I have my ult.
[151:03.14]I ulted too, shit.
[151:07.36]Shit.
[151:13.77]Oh!
[151:18.49]I will take, I'll take that.
[151:25.49]Fucking Reinhardt shield.
[151:26.23]I have to get this now!
[151:28.11]I need this now!
[151:37.81]I need this right now!
[151:38.85]What we got?
[151:47.06]It's okay.
[151:54.80]I panicked.
[151:56.00]But sometimes you have to panic.
[152:01.76]I fucking panicked.
[152:13.09]Let me lose.
[152:21.16]If only I'd held on.
[152:22.20]I just thought we were gonna... You know what happened.
[152:27.79]I don't even have to say what happened.
[152:28.83]Mr. Sneak Man!
[152:31.99]I love how you're taking that Sneak Man name perfectly serious with the lore.
[152:37.51]Sneaking out of the coffin.
[152:41.79]For some reason, I thought that it was... We had to just kill that one person really quickly and we would cap it, but that didn't happen.
[152:58.45]At least I actually did something in the end there.
[153:09.62]We all have a dream to catch.
[153:10.90]Well, thanks for playing, Blue Snow.
[153:18.52]We're not done.
[153:22.56]You thought that because you suck.
[153:27.37]Hey, look, nowhere have I ever listed that I'm, like, trying to be very good at this game.
[153:33.51]Wait, what?
[153:36.81]I don't have, like, a billboard in my backyard saying, hey, I'm fucking gonna be great at Overwatch.
[153:43.16]You know, people would drive by, the people throwing fucking beer bottles at it, like, fuck you, no you're not.
[153:48.32]If I had that billboard, I would see where you were coming from.
[153:52.40]But I don't.
[153:57.20]It's me smiling in a suit like it's a lawyer billboard.
[154:00.70]I'm in like a three-piece suit.
[154:02.92]Huge smile.
[154:19.17]I'm fucking great at Overwatch.
[154:21.87]Yeah, it says I'm fucking great at Overwatch.
[154:24.90]And then in brackets underneath, you should be jealous.
[154:28.55]And there is my personal phone number.
[154:31.83]And it says, like, give me a call, fucking noobs.
[154:35.09]I don't have that billboard.
[154:49.86]And right next to that, it says, this is my personal phone number.
[154:52.91]I dare you.
[154:53.59]That's what it says.
[154:57.91]If she walked out, I would have grabbed her.
[155:00.93]She stood there.
[155:14.94]Ow.
[155:19.14]No, you just got away.
[155:21.66]You're a lucky little snake.
[155:26.43]What is happening in this room?
[155:28.74]I'm so fucking confused.
[155:30.74]What the hell's going on?
[155:39.73]I got no coordination at the moment.
[155:41.37]Zero.
[155:43.00]As zero as you could have.
[155:45.06]Their rolling is too hard for me to even know what's going on.
[155:58.53]They are killing us so badly that I couldn't even... My brain was somewhere else.
[156:12.69]Holy shit.
[156:18.82]Really?
[156:20.50]No, life sucks.
[156:22.90]Apparently life sucks.
[156:33.67]What rank was I in Season 1?
[156:35.09]65.
[156:35.23]I didn't play Season 2 or Season 3.
[156:41.59]I got nothing.
[156:44.04]Okay.
[156:44.58]That was a waste.
[157:12.78]No!
[157:15.20]Fuck.
[157:20.07]I love you, Jerma, but you still suck.
[157:23.65]Well, that's okay.
[157:29.05]Oh, you motherfucker!
[157:31.74]What are you doing?
[157:33.46]No!
[157:33.68]No!
[157:36.63]No, what?
[157:38.27]What are you... Come on, dude.
[157:41.24]We have like a fucking important game to play.
[157:45.94]You're gonna do... That's why we lose.
[157:55.08]Todd.
[157:56.06]Todd, you son of a bitch.
[158:03.47]No, I don't expect to be very good at the game.
[158:05.33]Because, like I said a couple times already, I haven't played in a long time.
[158:13.11]I have not played 6v6 Overwatch since Season 1.
[158:16.69]So, you know.
[158:23.53]But it doesn't matter, I'm having fun.
[158:28.21]Thanks for playing, guys.
[158:30.23]Let's do another viewer game here.
[158:37.43]He saw the billboard.
[158:39.47]Yeah.
[158:40.07]All these guys thinking I have a billboard.
[158:47.99]Alright, thanks a lot, guys.
[158:50.89]Was that two viewer games in a row, or was that just one?
[158:52.61]I think it was just one.
[159:01.56]Come on in.
[159:06.75]And while we sit here and wait, thanks to TaserMad, Verith for two months, Oshibo, Berkishman, Hypespider, KevDoesLife, AceTech09, ColossalWaffle, SirSamich, SirVetches, and then I think that's caught up.
[159:27.72]Thanks a lot, guys.
[159:31.78]And much love.
[159:34.78]Let's get some new people in here.
[159:38.25]We'll do this.
[159:38.61]We'll do one more sub game, then I'm probably going to take off.
[159:41.14]So we'll do this, then sub, and then I'm going to go get some lunch.
[159:51.10]Why are these not showing up now?
[160:03.65]Why the fuck are these not showing up?
[160:11.84]uh let's see here we go I had a couple of good games today the bad is outweigh the good but I still did okay in a couple of those games I'm like a slot machine
[160:41.30]Sometimes a slot machine runs hot and then it just runs cold.
[160:46.98]There were a couple of games there where you got at least like 300 bucks from that slot machine.
[160:51.16]At least.
[160:57.77]Now it's running cold.
[160:59.85]You should have taken your money and ran.
[161:06.21]Four more.
[161:07.99]Goose Terry.
[161:08.73]Let's get the goose in here.
[161:14.10]Three more.
[161:16.77]Mr. Chicken.
[161:19.05]How are you, my friend?
[161:19.97]I like this guy's name.
[161:24.57]Horse All Day.
[161:25.69]Oh, you're playing at a competitive game.
[161:32.20]Mr. Horse.
[161:35.70]One more.
[161:36.02]And we'll move on.
[161:44.58]I want my money back.
[161:47.50]Alright, that's it.
[161:51.75]Let's make sure... I don't want to play on Nepal again.
[161:54.07]I want to play on... Where is it now?
[162:02.33]Lijiang Tower.
[162:02.95]Let's do Lijiang Tower.
[162:05.01]Turn them all off besides Lijiang.
[162:06.37]Okay.
[162:09.13]Okay.
[162:11.28]What?
[162:11.56]Why is it giving me Temple of Anubis?
[162:12.94]Oh, it's good.
[162:13.56]I thought it was always permanently up.
[162:14.90]It's not.
[162:17.16]Lijiang Tower.
[162:21.04]What?
[162:21.62]How the fuck did you get in here?
[162:24.48]How did you get in here?
[162:28.18]Horse is already in the lobby.
[162:29.20]Oh, fuck.
[162:29.70]Well, I'm an idiot.
[162:31.60]Did I invite Etalyx?
[162:32.52]No, I didn't.
[162:32.94]He just, like, jumped in here.
[162:35.25]Hold on.
[162:35.63]I'm going to see if he's in team speak so I can yell at him.
[162:43.91]He's not even in TeamSpeak.
[162:47.59]You're taking a viewer spot right now.
[162:49.15]Be better than him, not me.
[162:53.49]I'm in TeamSpeak if you want to talk, Daleks.
[162:55.29]It means you wanted to coordinate with the team.
[162:58.29]Dot, dot, dot, dot.
[163:01.95]You're a real piece of shit.
[163:08.53]Alright, let's get a good game in here.
[163:11.23]Come on.
[163:11.61]Run the casino hot.
[163:13.99]Give me like three sevens in a row in this game.
[163:21.27]I'm going to do that with a Zen.
[163:22.97]Let's play Zenyatta.
[163:25.03]We're going to coordinate.
[163:25.85]I'm on the other team.
[163:28.02]You like sneaking in here?
[163:29.12]You can't just like sneak in here.
[163:30.50]It's a prank, man.
[163:32.42]That's not a prank.
[163:33.46]That's called stealing from someone.
[163:36.20]Oh, well look.
[163:38.20]If I were to steal from these people, I would have stolen from the next people, so... I'm giving to the next group, so... It's alright.
[163:48.59]He'll be okay.
[163:51.90]It's okay.
[163:52.26]It's rigged anyway.
[163:53.30]I hope Etalyx kicks your ass.
[163:56.78]Oh, you're on the other team.
[163:57.84]That's great.
[163:59.14]Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[164:00.24]You were like, hey, let's come in and coordinate.
[164:03.65]You gotta be cordial to me.
[164:06.13]If I steal a spot, I'm the bad guy.
[164:08.23]If I ask you to play and you say yes, you're the bad guy.
[164:10.99]So I just made myself the bad guy so that you can be the good guy.
[164:15.35]Okay, that works for me.
[164:17.29]As long as you get to be the bad guy.
[164:18.75]Alright, I tried.
[164:30.78]I tried.
[164:34.58]Figured I could sneak an attack.
[164:39.59]Really need to get over there where my team is.
[164:41.05]That would be great.
[164:49.07]No, I'm just dead.
[164:49.59]Fuck.
[164:52.50]Fuck.
[165:01.01]I blame what I did in the very beginning.
[165:02.25]I went the other way to try to kill Azaria.
[165:06.65]I'm gonna go around to the right and kill Azaria.
[165:09.02]That sounds like what the support should be doing, right?
[165:12.38]Lag, lag, that's lag.
[165:19.20]Tell me about Overwatch.
[165:20.93]What?
[165:21.35]What about it?
[165:22.21]I didn't expect you to be playing this game in the morning.
[165:26.89]Or period, for that matter.
[165:30.03]Neither did I. I'm kind of getting dunked on.
[165:33.31]Did you just get in the mood?
[165:36.29]Fun game.
[165:37.03]No, I just figured that maybe... I'm going to play... No, what the fuck am I going to play right now?
[165:40.95]I'm getting shit on.
[165:41.81]I don't know.
[165:44.99]This.
[165:49.05]Well, I figured I could play viewer games.
[165:50.39]That sounded like fun.
[165:52.57]Yeah, I didn't know how easy it was to invite people.
[165:54.69]It's pretty cool.
[165:55.89]I don't think it ever used to be this easy.
[166:04.10]Oh, fuck me.
[166:05.30]Fuck me.
[166:07.72]You had to bring it back to life?
[166:12.29]Come on.
[166:22.51]Yes, I did get my play of the game.
[166:24.05]I did.
[166:25.52]It happened on Reaper.
[166:26.86]Yeah, the last couple games I've been on, like, the fucking getting diarrhea'd on team.
[166:36.74]Come on, team.
[166:37.86]Pull your pants on.
[166:40.18]Put them on.
[166:40.62]Let's do it.
[166:52.54]Where is he?
[166:54.16]This guy's just trying to launch me off every time.
[166:59.39]God damn it.
[167:01.99]Hey, you're not even supposed to be here right now.
[167:06.18]My mortal enemy.
[167:07.10]Yeah, the guy that would have taken your spot could have been, like, nine years old.
[167:13.98]And, like, not good at Reinhardt.
[167:15.96]Oh.
[167:18.10]Well, I am way older than nine and still not good at Reinhardt, so.
[167:25.24]Ay-yi-yi.
[167:29.27]I fight better with no pants on.
[167:36.15]It's you, Jeremy.
[167:36.89]You're on why your team is... Hey.
[167:38.61]Hey.
[167:39.05]Hey.
[167:39.67]Easy.
[167:40.51]Easy.
[167:40.71]Here come the BabyRages.
[167:43.83]Uh-oh.
[167:45.25]Uh-oh.
[167:45.53]What have I done?
[167:46.21]Uh-oh.
[167:48.12]Alright.
[167:48.32]Let's turn those rages into... What's like the... Yeah.
[167:53.30]Is there like a yeah emote?
[167:56.32]O-face.
[167:57.02]O-face.
[167:57.18]We're going to turn those BabyRages into O-faces.
[167:59.00]You ready?
[168:01.97]Except the whole team is going that way.
[168:05.26]Except every single fucking person went this way.
[168:07.96]Let's turn that fucking BabyRage into four people coming down that... Turn that fucking clown into a frown.
[168:20.27]Can I please see some PogChamps to make me feel like I'm doing cool things?
[168:37.95]Come on, let's see some PogChamps.
[168:39.39]PogChamps.
[168:42.41]This is a disaster right now.
[168:48.89]Let me look at that chat.
[168:50.01]Oh, nice.
[168:50.55]You see what he did?
[168:52.09]Fucking hell yeah.
[168:53.64]I feel like a confident streamer now.
[169:00.62]I'm just going up there.
[169:02.32]In the window.
[169:09.04]I can fucking do anything.
[169:11.12]I was gonna play Junkrat and spam in the window.
[169:15.12]That's the only thing I can fucking do right now.
[169:16.58]I can't even get in there.
[169:18.10]My game's lagging so bad.
[169:26.28]I hit a bunch of his... Great!
[169:35.96]You know it's bad when you hear about the lag.
[169:39.92]I'm streaming at 60 FPS right now.
[169:41.62]It's a high FPS.
[169:46.60]Counter.
[169:48.48]Don't do it!
[169:49.08]Don't do it!
[169:50.52]God fucking dammit!
[169:53.24]What the fuck?
[169:54.04]Alright, I'm just playing Winston.
[169:56.68]I'm just gonna play fucking Dr. Winston.
[169:59.48]And not want to fucking throw up directly into my wall and never clean it and just have a green stain for the rest of my fucking life.
[170:26.18]I just get pulled through the fucking wall.
[170:27.64]What the fuck is happening?
[170:29.74]Join the exhibit.
[170:30.78]I'm on tilt right now.
[170:57.82]Oh, he was so low.
[171:01.32]Watch out for this.
[171:02.22]Watch out for this.
[171:13.40]So many human beings in here.
[171:15.50]Way too many human beings.
[171:19.54]High brain, high cerebral activity Winston main.
[171:32.70]Right through the window.
[171:33.34]I feel like I can't say anything.
[171:39.14]I'm only going to make your situation worse.
[171:43.43]It's going to be me bragging.
[171:44.05]I'm just dead immediately.
[171:44.95]I thought I could make something happen, but... I'm gone immediately.
[171:55.85]PogChamp overrated.
[171:57.13]Kappa overrated.
[172:04.52]We're gonna get it.
[172:04.98]Oh my god, we're actually gonna get it.
[172:09.46]Watch this one.
[172:18.97]Come find me!
[172:19.75]Come get me!
[172:20.63]Fuck, I was gonna say I deserve something for that one, but it didn't happen.
[172:24.89]I was trying to cheese pizza the fucking Pharah out of the air.
[172:55.53]Don't!
[173:00.01]Alright, let me ask you something.
[173:01.83]Are you guys talking in team chat?
[173:04.91]Uh... No.
[173:06.99]Why are you all four connected to each other?
[173:08.99]There was one guy, and he said something twice.
[173:11.49]So, no.
[173:12.65]Why are you guys doing so much good coordination?
[173:15.01]It's not fair.
[173:18.27]What do we have to say?
[173:18.97]Three competitive players.
[173:20.17]Yeah, you're playing on fucking Team CVS on your team.
[173:28.54]Got team players here, man.
[173:30.88]Get out of my fucking hut.
[173:40.33]It's about ethics and pizza toppings?
[173:42.17]What does that mean?
[173:46.07]How is this still going?
[173:46.99]I'm not sure.
[173:49.33]Oh, that's a Reddit meme.
[173:51.91]Oh.
[173:53.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[173:56.06]I missed it the one time it counted.
[173:57.24]I missed it.
[174:13.89]Battled.
[174:14.73]Battled.
[174:16.75]Where is she?
[174:17.31]Where is she?
[174:20.09]Come on, this is for the cheese pizza.
[174:23.13]Yes!
[174:34.76]Come chase me.
[174:39.02]Alright, I'm gonna play a different character.
[174:46.12]Let's go with freeze breath.
[174:55.07]Real talk, Domino's or Pizza Hut?
[174:56.39]Neither one.
[174:56.85]Papagino's.
[175:00.09]Domino's sucks.
[175:00.93]Pizza Hut sucks.
[175:01.81]Papagino's is the one you want.
[175:04.57]I don't know what Papagino's is, but I agree with the first statement.
[175:13.07]Dominoes, gross.
[175:14.23]Pizza Hut, gross.
[175:15.01]Coolest thing they ever did was the stuffed crust.
[175:17.91]They, like, kind of pioneered that.
[175:20.25]But it's hard to pioneer stuff when the rest of your entire selection of pizza is disgusting.
[175:35.04]Where'd he go?
[175:35.54]He's dead.
[175:43.67]Whoa, a lot of people there.
[175:52.57]No, don't think so.
[175:55.43]Not today, Etalyx.
[175:58.54]But I did some beastly damage to you.
[176:02.76]I did.
[176:04.48]You did beast me.
[176:18.58]What are you doing over here?
[176:20.70]You just saved my life, Lúcio.
[176:22.74]You are my favorite person ever.
[176:23.86]What do you think of diving in on me like that?
[176:33.29]Don't you know I was a 64 rated player Season 1?
[176:37.07]You don't just do that to somebody that's a 64 player.
[176:45.87]Hey, what the fuck?
[176:48.59]They went the other way.
[176:53.16]How did I not see them?
[176:57.60]Okay.
[176:59.32]I would like to run that tape back and see if they were both standing there.
[177:04.44]They were both fucking invisible.
[177:07.38]They were not on my screen.
[177:08.80]They were not there.
[177:10.22]Please tell me they were not there.
[177:11.70]Please, somebody tell me I'm fucking not crazy.
[177:18.76]Like, there's no way.
[177:23.64]Did anybody else see those two people?
[177:25.87]Because I didn't.
[177:29.63]I saw them, but they were on my team.
[177:33.09]They were invisible.
[177:35.39]They're rated 65.
[177:36.37]I can't see them.
[177:37.54]They're not visible.
[177:43.64]Well.
[177:44.78]No, I want to be...
[177:51.20]How do I want to be here?
[177:55.57]Yeah, I knew they were there when I climbed on the wall, but it made it look like I just walked by them when I didn't see them on my screen.
[178:09.03]If I'm insane, I'll be insane, but I don't think they were there.
[178:18.09]No, no, no, no.
[178:27.39]Oh, you're so low.
[178:28.33]I didn't know that.
[178:40.89]Oh, gosh darn it.
[178:41.59]It's okay.
[178:48.35]Did he go up there?
[178:49.09]He did, didn't he?
[178:54.98]I'm coming for you.
[179:00.47]I will find you.
[179:06.83]Holy shit.
[179:13.63]I just got lucky.
[179:24.26]It's all about getting lucky at this point.
[179:32.78]Alright, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[179:35.60]Snow boy.
[179:45.25]Don't you dare.
[179:46.17]Damn it.
[179:51.17]Is this Planet Coaster?
[179:55.60]Hey, look at that.
[179:56.92]I cannot believe this.
[180:01.31]Look at me holding that bronze medal.
[180:02.72]That's a bronze medal I'm holding.
[180:03.84]GG, Jerma won for once.
[180:28.93]Alright, this is the last one I'm going to do sub game.
[180:33.17]I got carried by a Talc.
[180:34.15]Talc was on the other team, so I won.
[180:35.67]Yeah, I was typing in team chat, we should throw so that Jerma can win on stream.
[180:40.45]Yeah, take a look at that fucking bronze medal 23, Kali Arenas.
[180:51.12]I'm taking my shirt right now, and I'm just waving it up and down.
[180:56.12]Alright, this is going to be the last one.
[180:58.44]It's going to be a sub game.
[181:00.23]Get out of here, Etalyx.
[181:01.75]Pouring water all over it.
[181:02.95]Etalyx, if you're going to play, at least I play on this team.
[181:05.45]You know what I mean?
[181:07.71]I didn't join that team.
[181:09.23]I just joined the game and it put me on that team.
[181:11.62]Alright, sub only.
[181:15.12]Hey, I'm a sub.
[181:16.38]You are a sub, that's true.
[181:17.62]So you can be in this one.
[181:25.19]Thank you, Spy Getty.
[181:27.15]Typical in Emily for 10 months.
[181:28.31]Hey, how was your Thanksgiving?
[181:29.25]It was great.
[181:30.33]Except it wasn't really.
[181:31.89]I didn't get to eat.
[181:34.39]My obnoxious, annoying medical condition kind of crept up on me and I wasn't able to eat Thanksgiving dinner with my family.
[181:39.61]I was like lying in bed downstairs at my parents' house.
[181:43.39]So I did get leftover zone.
[181:45.75]I did have, they were great.
[181:46.91]They were good.
[181:49.47]I'm fine now.
[181:50.37]I got my medicine.
[181:50.95]I'll be good.
[181:51.53]Don't worry.
[181:53.75]Let's get some people in here.
[181:55.46]You're wondering his medical condition is kleptomania.
[181:59.80]They were worried he was going to steal all the food from the table, so he just wasn't allowed to eat.
[182:05.56]Can we get a couple of sympathy laughs for Etalyx, please, with that really, really bad joke?
[182:10.24]I want to see the forehead.
[182:13.44]Just do forehead.
[182:14.04]Make him look down and be like, oh, that was a funny one.
[182:22.10]I just woke up.
[182:24.56]Just fucking with you, dude.
[182:28.98]Alright.
[182:29.50]Let's get some people in here.
[182:31.14]There's just some dudes and dudettes.
[182:35.44]Yeah, sympathy laugh is ha-ha.
[182:38.14]Is it?
[182:38.98]No, that's like the nerdy laugh.
[182:40.40]People do that to me all the time.
[182:41.30]You're telling me people don't think I'm fun?
[182:47.68]Colossal Waffle.
[182:48.72]Let's get you in here, dude.
[182:58.68]This is gonna be it for the day.
[183:00.10]Yeah, that's two versus colossal waffle.
[183:03.68]No, two V one.
[183:11.41]Let's get you in here.
[183:19.12]Maybe I'll have a box after this and we can hope I get something cool.
[183:25.00]Let's check this list.
[183:27.40]Oh, Mr. Secret.
[183:28.36]Secret.
[183:30.66]Who knows who this guy is in real life?
[183:32.98]That could be Brad Pitt.
[183:35.25]And we'll never know.
[183:41.83]Could be.
[183:44.97]Shanghai Noon.
[183:45.69]I like that movie.
[183:47.08]Hey, Spy Getty just subscribed.
[183:50.10]And is he going to get in?
[183:50.90]He is.
[184:00.31]I need four more.
[184:03.68]XP from custom games.
[184:05.00]No, I know.
[184:05.38]I'm just saying.
[184:06.04]What if I can get one?
[184:12.84]Lucy say stab.
[184:18.56]DD.
[184:19.02]I think you were in a game before.
[184:22.62]Or maybe you weren't.
[184:23.14]I don't remember.
[184:26.38]Two more.
[184:27.62]Final sub game.
[184:28.54]Final game.
[184:29.72]This is the only time I wish I had Overwatch.
[184:32.56]If you had Overwatch for the first time and got into this game, you would hate Overwatch.
[184:39.49]Are you saying that my subs and viewers are fucking really good at the game?
[184:42.49]Because they are.
[184:45.21]Look at how I'm doing against them.
[184:46.87]I mean, I was ranked 66 in Season 1.
[184:53.04]Think about it.
[184:56.25]It gets higher every time you say it.
[184:57.77]Think about it.
[184:59.41]I was, like, 68 in Season 1.
[185:01.71]I was.
[185:02.07]I mean, I was.
[185:04.69]Remember when I was, like, 71 in Season 1?
[185:06.85]I know.
[185:07.37]Excuse me.
[185:07.81]That's an incorrect statement.
[185:08.85]Let's go to Dorado.
[185:10.07]Remember when I was top 100 in Season 1?
[185:20.33]Top 100.
[185:21.59]Well, and now we have some time.
[185:24.11]Let's go ahead and just slam this fucking rest...
[185:30.85]Thank you.
[185:32.23]I'm trying to say thank you, Etalyx.
[185:33.77]Stop.
[185:34.35]Stop it.
[185:36.11]Hey, what is that?
[185:36.65]A Dunkin' Donuts coffee?
[185:39.31]It is.
[185:42.07]Thank you, LumX24 Spaghetti.
[185:44.10]Typical anomaly.
[185:46.30]That was the 10-monther.
[185:48.92]I think I said hey to TasterMadVareth.
[185:51.02]Oshibo.
[185:52.06]Berkishman for eight months and nine months.
[185:53.52]Thanks a lot, Oshibo and Berkishman.
[185:54.76]Hypespider for two months.
[185:56.06]KevDoesLife.
[185:58.93]His camera's all over his house.
[186:00.51]That's the TV show Kev Does Life on CBS.
[186:02.51]Thanks, Kev.
[186:04.93]Thanks a lot, guys.
[186:08.11]And then, a bunch of bits.
[186:10.16]Thanks for the bits!
[186:12.14]You guys are fucking cool.
[186:14.66]Love ya!
[186:16.58]Final game, we're gonna do McCree, and I'm gonna get one, two, three.
[186:22.46]Windows 10 is acting up again?
[186:24.46]I have to get Windows 10.
[186:25.48]Thank you for reminding me.
[186:28.35]Have fun with that.
[186:29.41]I'm going to be hearing about why Windows 10 sucks for a while after that.
[186:34.41]Well, you have to have it to play Dead Rising.
[186:35.85]You have to have it to play a lot of things nowadays.
[186:40.41]You have to have Windows 10 to even install Dead Rising 4.
[186:43.40]Or Gears of War.
[186:47.10]Or any of the other Windows play-anywhere games.
[186:50.82]Why?
[186:51.10]Because that's their compromise.
[186:55.93]They're like, okay, you want Xbox games on PC?
[186:58.74]Okay, here you go, but you have to have Windows 10.
[187:03.72]It's kind of dumb because we want Windows 10 to be a success.
[187:08.02]I didn't kill him.
[187:10.91]I don't understand how I didn't kill that Zenyatta.
[187:14.81]I just didn't hit him.
[187:16.05]I hit him with four bullets, apparently.
[187:26.18]Thank you, Lucretius.
[187:27.18]That would be very helpful next time.
[187:28.90]Yeah, I just kind of on a whim decided to do this.
[187:32.88]I don't know if this is going to be a thing I'm going to be doing all the time, but I'm sure you'll see it pop up every now and then when I'm just kind of off schedule, just fucking around, you know?
[187:41.19]Getting my ass kicked on stream in front of more than 2,000 people.
[187:47.35]You know.
[187:48.79]Whee!
[187:49.05]That's the way it is.
[187:57.13]Hmm, we still got him.
[188:11.04]Safe still.
[188:13.58]Good nano boost.
[188:15.96]Could have been better if I had landed my little pin.
[188:19.17]Watch out for the Genji freaking out up here.
[188:22.23]Yeah.
[188:26.20]There's that wonderful tracking that I have.
[188:28.12]I just couldn't fucking hit him!
[188:46.73]He's going back and forth and back and forth, just diving everywhere!
[188:49.79]Goddamn Genji, man.
[188:56.01]I should've just moved on.
[189:08.52]Fuck that stupid fucking hero.
[189:14.30]I fucking hate Genji.
[189:20.29]I gotta flip this table over.
[189:37.30]Salt, salt.
[189:37.86]Let's see the salt shakers.
[189:40.42]Hey, give that motherfucker a double jump, Blizzard.
[189:42.64]What a great idea.
[189:43.48]Oh my gosh.
[189:50.86]I'm so dead in here.
[190:03.41]Yeah.
[190:07.09]Oh, bye-bye.
[190:09.15]To be fair, Sherma's not wrong.
[190:13.03]Genji's the reason.
[190:13.89]Nobody plays Overwatch anymore.
[190:17.25]He used to have a triple jump.
[190:27.10]Watch this.
[190:28.40]I'll make up for it.
[190:35.56]Shh, quiet, quiet.
[190:40.50]Just kidding.
[190:42.88]It was a joke.
[190:43.34]I was making a joke.
[190:44.02]Okay, I'm gonna play something else.
[190:49.48]I just wanted an excuse to get the fuck off this character because I wasn't doing anything.
[191:05.47]Shh, quiet, quiet.
[191:13.92]Oh my god, we're getting just fucking rolled.
[191:19.34]I don't know which way to look.
[191:24.87]No, it's gonna come and kill me!
[191:26.69]I can already smell it!
[191:28.19]I can smell it!
[191:28.83]It's freaking me out, I knew it!
[191:32.81]It smelled like oil and burnt shit!
[191:43.45]Somebody go help me.
[191:50.45]Oh my fucking god.
[191:51.83]I don't even know how I'm still alive.
[192:02.88]Yeah, I did hit the wall with my hook.
[192:05.70]I'm very aware of it.
[192:18.84]Oh my goodness.
[192:20.48]Sorry.
[192:21.22]Sorry guys, they might have killed us.
[192:27.12]Jesus.
[192:27.72]Dude, it's just not fucking possible.
[192:44.63]This is impossible.
[192:50.61]Holy shit.
[192:58.45]I was gonna eat that pumpkin.
[193:10.40]Goodness.
[193:18.58]Be ready to hook.
[193:24.39]Where is Mr. Sneakman?
[193:27.15]I wish Mr. Sneakman was on our team.
[193:35.54]It was in the last game.
[193:36.34]It kept going.
[193:36.90]It's me.
[193:38.18]Mr. Sneakman.
[193:40.26]Top 500.
[193:43.77]I'll play Sombra for the last one.
[193:44.99]That sounds like fun.
[193:47.37]I can't see how that could possibly be frustrating.
[193:51.44]um can't get any more frustrating than it's already been for me this last 10 minutes of me hating myself we're gonna be sneaky solid three eliminations yeah
[194:23.72]What's the general consensus?
[194:24.94]That Sombra's not fun?
[194:26.86]I don't know.
[194:29.50]She seems like she could be pretty fun in the right hands.
[194:31.50]I feel like there's some people that could do some pretty cool shit with her.
[194:40.20]It's a very big clip.
[194:41.36]It's something I have not been paying that much attention to.
[194:45.89]That's extremely huge.
[194:48.11]Very much huge.
[194:49.65]Large.
[194:50.81]You mad because I'm hungry?
[194:55.68]No, I ate a Snickers before the stream.
[194:58.74]Candy!
[195:00.78]Candy, what?
[195:03.42]I'll eat it.
[195:04.39]No, it's just like... Oh, catchable candy!
[195:08.93]Hungry?
[195:09.61]No way, I ate a Snickers.
[195:17.96]Snickers is both filling in.
[195:19.22]That was that funny to you?
[195:21.61]That's our default Overwatch symbol.
[195:23.85]That's how we do.
[195:30.19]And he fucking knows.
[195:31.61]He's watching the stream!
[195:33.03]He's fucking watching.
[195:34.69]Of course he is.
[195:35.81]This is a fucking sub game.
[195:37.39]What am I, crazy?
[195:43.39]You fucking asshole.
[195:45.44]You asshole.
[195:54.88]Now it's funny.
[195:57.22]It's funny.
[196:04.84]Nobody there.
[196:05.87]OK.
[196:05.97]Get me out of there.
[196:14.63]Damn it.
[196:37.33]He goes somber when people can stream snipe.
[196:39.12]Yeah, but I just want to... Who cares?
[196:41.10]It's all good.
[196:42.00]Look, they still have to kill me.
[196:44.80]Alright?
[196:47.34]Even if they know where I'm going.
[196:48.47]Yeah, there's a delay.
[196:49.15]Hey there.
[197:10.46]Excuse me.
[197:10.98]At least I got it off, and the ult is gone.
[197:21.24]That's really all I wanted to do there.
[197:22.60]I wanted to get rid of the Lúcio ult.
[197:25.33]And I think I succeeded in that.
[197:27.65]At least I hope I did.
[197:36.67]Add a two-year delay to your streams.
[197:44.91]Hack it.
[197:46.19]Hack it!
[197:47.78]Just in case they come all the way back to, like, the spawn.
[197:49.68]What the fuck am I doing?
[197:54.48]I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.
[197:56.14]I'm trying to be funny.
[197:57.18]I'm trying to be, like, a funny guy.
[197:58.60]It's gonna backfire.
[198:05.13]Oh, shit!
[198:05.78]I teleported back to it!
[198:07.06]Oh, fuck!
[198:10.54]I thought I could throw it out.
[198:11.58]Oops!
[198:13.56]Oh, that's... Hey there.
[198:34.64]What?
[198:37.26]Unfunny streamer.
[198:38.56]Did I get accidentally shot in the fucking head?
[198:42.11]Yeah, great.
[198:44.57]That's fucking fantastic.
[198:48.91]I got shot as far on the back of my body as I could possibly get shot.
[198:53.07]And died.
[198:54.93]She didn't even know she shot me.
[198:57.36]She's probably just like, what the fuck was that?
[199:07.95]What is it doing in here?
[199:09.57]What is it doing in here?
[199:14.10]I think they knew you were going to throw it in.
[199:17.46]Oh, god damn it.
[199:19.92]No.
[199:23.06]I turn around and there's a fucking D.Va alt statue behind me.
[199:27.82]He's shitting me?
[199:31.92]Oh, I can feel it in my bones.
[199:33.16]I can feel the anger in my bones.
[199:57.75]Don't do it.
[199:58.41]He's coming for me.
[200:00.01]Watch this.
[200:01.19]Watch this.
[200:04.07]I'm invisible.
[200:06.81]No, no.
[200:10.33]What's happening?
[200:10.97]Oh, boy.
[200:12.71]Oh, it's just a Lúcio.
[200:18.52]I gotta fucking kill this Lúcio.
[200:22.80]At least I kept three people busy.
[200:35.16]Are we not even gonna get the first point?
[200:36.96]We're gonna get the first point.
[200:38.32]I hope we are.
[200:55.17]Fire in the hole.
[201:05.76]Oh, please.
[201:12.48]Hack the add-on.
[201:16.92]I'm on it.
[201:17.58]I'm on it.
[201:19.68]Well, that's okay.
[201:27.83]Play of the match.
[201:31.89]Can't wait to see what it was.
[201:32.72]Of course he was right out of the range.
[201:37.02]Damn it.
[201:46.88]Hey, at least you hit people with your rockets.
[201:50.60]Yeah, I did.
[201:57.64]You have fun at Sombra?
[201:59.58]Yeah, no.
[201:59.96]I wasn't doing a whole lot, but it was fun to jump around.
[202:04.81]I have never played a... Can't go out in a game like that?
[202:07.37]Well... Alright, I'm playing just like quick play for one.
[202:11.65]I'm on a box.
[202:12.54]How close am I to a level?
[202:17.36]How can you see that?
[202:18.62]Career profile?
[202:22.08]Yeah.
[202:23.14]Oh, no.
[202:23.87]It's not going to happen.
[202:24.81]I'm not close enough.
[202:27.15]How far down is Sombra on the competitive scale?
[202:30.11]I have no idea.
[202:31.95]Or up.
[202:35.55]No, whoops, no.
[202:36.02]I don't know.
[202:37.78]I'm sure somebody knows.
[202:41.10]Do Arcade 1v1.
[202:42.20]Alright, I'm going to do an Arcade 1v1 Mystery Duel to end the stream.
[202:50.51]I get a box, actually, if I win, right?
[202:52.07]Alright, I get a win.
[202:56.04]The bottom.
[202:58.06]D.Va versus D.Va.
[203:00.51]This is going to be really, really awful.
[203:07.59]Okay, this map is odd.
[203:12.18]I already lost.
[203:23.50]Yeah, it's like I already lose.
[203:25.00]Whoever takes the first point of damage loses one of these fights.
[203:37.89]That was actually close.
[203:39.94]Dude, okay, D.Va 1v1, Winston 1v1, Reinhardt 1v1.
[203:44.88]Whoever does the first point of damage is gonna win the fucking game.
[203:48.90]We're gonna be here for a while on this one.
[203:50.64]No.
[204:03.75]I wish you could shoot those.
[204:08.43]Where'd you go?
[204:21.21]Oh, I'm impressed.
[204:21.85]That was a good round.
[204:25.26]True Sombra.
[204:29.74]Oh, no.
[204:30.16]Somebody just said Zarya 1v1 is awful.
[204:32.06]And that's Zarya 1v1.
[204:37.60]Don't you want to play more tanks 1v1?
[204:39.26]No, I don't.
[204:44.57]Come on.
[204:44.85]Remember, whoever does the first absorb... I got it.
[205:15.23]Red light.
[205:15.57]Green light.
[205:16.15]Red light.
[205:16.73]Green light.
[205:17.21]That sucks.
[205:19.49]Red light.
[205:20.63]Yeah, Roadhog won.
[205:21.37]Whoever hooks first loses.
[205:23.53]No, this is exactly what he's talking about.
[205:25.59]Winston versus Winston is just whoever touches you with the electricity first wins.
[205:29.07]No, I don't want to go up there.
[205:34.39]You can also put your shield down and shoot from within the shield.
[205:36.89]Yeah, but he's going to do the same thing.
[205:38.71]Isn't he?
[205:43.77]Okay, I think I hit, did we both tick each other once?
[205:46.77]Once?
[205:47.17]How much health does he have?
[205:55.93]How the fuck did I win?
[206:08.68]This was just a fucking roll of the dice of who was gonna win that game.
[206:14.48]Throw the dice down.
[206:15.26]Who wins?
[206:15.80]Oh, great.
[206:16.34]Whoever hooks first loses.
[206:20.83]Etalyx, you gotta remind me not to hook.
[206:24.93]Okay, don't.
[206:25.49]Well, don't hook.
[206:26.47]Don't hook.
[206:27.21]Okay.
[206:27.69]You got it.
[206:28.57]When they hook you, then you hook them.
[206:30.65]You shoot, then hook, then shoot again.
[206:32.77]Alright.
[206:38.98]Miss.
[206:39.34]He missed.
[206:40.06]Hook is down.
[206:44.90]What?!
[206:47.79]He got a headshot on you.
[206:49.37]God damn it.
[207:04.35]I gotta win the McCree fight.
[207:06.99]No, I'm... fuck.
[207:08.34]I thought you guys have a solemn agreement to always go to the side.
[207:16.79]God fucking damn it.
[207:21.27]I thought for some reason I could get him around the corner if I hit him with that.
[207:26.01]I ain't going that way this time.
[207:32.78]Neither is he.
[207:37.54]Behind you.
[207:38.76]Don't say that.
[207:40.16]I heard him.
[207:40.48]He's probably... He's not behind me.
[207:44.60]He was?
[207:45.08]Well, he's not now.
[207:53.43]There you go.
[207:53.93]Gaia!
[208:15.10]Everyone that was asking why, I thought I could get right behind him.
[208:18.02]Wasted recall?
[208:18.78]It don't matter.
[208:22.24]Still one.
[208:22.74]Doesn't matter.
[208:23.38]Still one.
[208:23.92]It's okay.
[208:24.74]Extreme rust.
[208:25.70]There's a lot of rust here.
[208:27.33]Great.
[208:27.69]I'm awful at this shit.
[208:32.71]He did the same shit that I was going to do.
[208:36.01]Should I go for it?
[208:36.65]What do you think?
[208:37.35]Should we do it?
[208:38.11]He's going to do it at the same time, isn't he?
[208:39.57]Okay.
[208:40.05]Do it at the same time.
[208:44.52]Alright.
[208:44.96]Let me just... Hold on.
[208:46.22]Let's be real here.
[208:48.58]That was like... I'm going to lose this because I thought we had an agreement.
[208:56.33]I thought we had an agreement there.
[208:58.99]I thought it was going to be, let's see what happens.
[209:00.47]Nope.
[209:01.81]Instead you got toroed.
[209:02.93]Instead I got killed.
[209:04.11]And now this is... This is the match point in this fucking bastion.
[209:13.49]Bullfighting.
[209:14.15]Great.
[209:16.63]Can't wait for like... I can't wait for it to be set up right now.
[209:19.85]And I'm just going to get annihilated.
[209:23.84]Yep, yep.
[209:24.44]Whoever set up first is the winner.
[209:27.12]Really great!
[209:28.34]You can't just set up in a door!
[209:30.40]But I thought, I was trying to do what he did to me, and that's like, oh my god, what a stupid mode.
[209:41.85]What a dumb fucking mode, let's be honest.
[209:47.96]Fucking bullshit.
[209:52.46]If you're gonna do 1v1, take out the characters that are just stupid for 1v1s.
[209:58.38]And guess what?
[209:59.56]Almost all these characters are terrible fucking 1v1s.
[210:03.76]Terrible.
[210:04.34]Terrible.
[210:05.68]Terrible.
[210:06.28]Terrible.
[210:07.98]Back to the fucking drawing board blizzard.
[210:15.02]I gotta win a mystery duel.
[210:20.06]I thought that was a mystery duel.
[210:21.52]No, I have to win one.
[210:23.05]Oh.
[210:25.67]You probably have to win five rounds.
[210:27.03]I think it would be better as three.
[210:34.97]1v1.
[210:35.21]No, I want a box.
[210:37.11]Gotta get a box.
[210:43.65]Take away the abilities?
[210:53.94]Jeremy is mad part mystery duel.
[210:59.00]And the idea is fun.
[211:02.02]But I guess it's like
[211:05.10]And you have like a Winston versus a Winston.
[211:06.66]I guess maybe that's a little different because you have to... Who's going to jump and... But like Reinhardt V. Reinhardt, it's just... Reinhardt's kind of more skilled than Winston.
[211:18.73]Is it though?
[211:19.19]Yeah, because if you land a pin, then you win.
[211:22.48]So landing a pin is like... How are you going to land a pin unless you both flip a coin and say, let's do it like I was going to do?
[211:29.52]Got to catch him off guard.
[211:33.80]thank you demonic dinos demonic dinos for nine months yeah boy thank you very much dude eat bread get head alright thanks for the sub I don't know that's a reference to banana slamma jr thanks for six months lummox24 thank you for your sub much love guys okay this is a little bit better every time I see that I keep thinking that that person is dead and that I already won
[212:04.43]Whoever gets the first or second good body shot wins the game.
[212:16.59]That was close.
[212:26.56]Hey, Chewy Rock, thanks for the nine months.
[212:30.74]No, not a...
[212:34.43]This is going to be horrible.
[212:37.37]So what?
[212:37.61]Should I just put my turret down and just not move?
[212:39.25]Is that the strategy?
[212:42.33]Yeah, that's what we're both doing.
[212:44.61]We both just did the same thing.
[212:45.53]Oh, god damn.
[212:51.91]Did he get two headshots in a row?
[212:57.29]I wish I could see that.
[213:01.27]Oh, it's D.Va again.
[213:04.38]I think I got hit in the fucking head twice.
[213:06.04]That sucked.
[213:22.60]Oh boy, this is where it counts.
[213:44.55]Alright.
[213:48.96]Defense Matrix doesn't help.
[213:51.78]I don't think it does.
[213:52.62]Because there's a slight delay when you take it down.
[213:54.88]So he's just shooting the whole time.
[213:57.22]Winston, Winston, Winston, huh?
[213:58.83]Okay.
[213:59.19]Why can't you get any attack heroes?
[214:01.31]I know.
[214:01.63]Those are fun.
[214:02.23]These are not cool.
[214:09.37]I got the first tick on him.
[214:27.90]Ooh, it's gonna be close.
[214:29.46]I gotta just touch him once.
[214:32.96]Okay.
[214:39.37]Alright, give us an offense.
[214:41.99]I'll take this.
[214:47.73]I'll take this one.
[214:48.43]Let's see where he is.
[214:58.05]I'm so scared.
[215:00.85]I'm going to freak him out here.
[215:13.78]If I let go, I would have killed him.
[215:15.32]Why the fuck did I right click?
[215:16.46]I thought he was going to come to the right.
[215:17.82]Shit.
[215:19.90]Oh, no, this is even worse.
[215:21.00]I'm so bad with Widowmaker.
[215:22.16]I gotta get lucky here is what has to happen.
[215:25.66]We're both gonna do the same thing.
[215:27.54]No, we're not.
[215:32.09]Okay, where the fuck did he go then?
[215:34.67]Well, he's mirrored, so he's probably doing it on his side.
[215:46.90]What?
[215:48.72]What?
[215:48.96]Did he hit me in the fucking hair?
[215:50.43]He can see your head and you can't see him at all.
[215:54.73]What the fuck?
[215:56.23]That's such bullshit.
[215:57.99]Today we learned a valuable lesson.
[215:59.91]Hold on.
[216:00.41]He can shoot me, but I can't shoot him through that wall.
[216:10.83]Don't ask me how the fuck I won that one.
[216:15.00]Score.
[216:22.89]Hair shot.
[216:24.54]Alright, I gotta win this one.
[216:26.54]Alright, that was a good hit.
[216:35.50]But he's gonna heal.
[216:50.97]Got him.
[216:51.59]Alright.
[216:52.11]I win.
[216:53.37]Got a loot box.
[216:53.97]Just barely.
[216:54.71]Okay.
[217:07.00]I took a little display of the game when I went Bastion.
[217:10.02]And I, like, got set up faster than he did.
[217:12.60]No.
[217:12.78]He got set up faster than you and he just missed.
[217:15.58]I don't know.
[217:16.72]Maybe he got fucked up.
[217:17.60]I don't know.
[217:20.82]Box acquired.
[217:21.56]Guess I was farther than you.
[217:25.28]That doesn't make any sense.
[217:27.92]He just missed.
[217:29.24]I saw all of his bullets go to your left.
[217:30.88]He was just in a hurry to aim, so he just started holding the trigger down.
[217:39.86]What a play.
[217:41.05]Alright, let's open the box.
[217:46.24]And then I'm going to take off.
[217:48.42]Yeah, me too.
[217:49.50]Alright, give me something good.
[217:54.02]Nothing.
[217:55.42]Just a bunch of shit.
[217:57.60]Oh, that's so cute.
[217:58.34]Put it on.
[218:01.50]Nice win, Jerma.
[218:02.34]Have a dollar.
[218:04.78]Thank you.
[218:06.20]Alright, guys.
[218:06.78]You're like a busker.
[218:09.06]What the hell is that word?
[218:10.04]A busker?
[218:11.55]Yeah, like you're on the street performing, and when you win in Overwatch, they throw a dollar in your hat.
[218:15.98]First win of the day.
[218:16.86]Well, I mean, I was doing custom games the whole time.
[218:20.72]Imagine streaming this game for like four hours and not winning a single game.
[218:23.76]That would be so infuriating is the word I'm looking for.
[218:27.72]Alright.
[218:30.66]I'm going to mute you for a second, Etalyx.
[218:32.22]I'll be there in a second.
[218:35.26]Thanks for coming out, guys.
[218:37.44]I'll probably do something like this again.
[218:39.76]I had a good time.
[218:41.50]And I mean, the last couple of games, I know I was like getting fucking raging, but not really.
[218:45.76]I had a great time.
[218:49.09]So, the next planned stream is going to be Tuesday.
[218:52.91]I'll see you guys on Tuesday night.
[218:54.93]I'm not sure what the hell I'm going to do, though.
[218:58.33]We'll figure it out.
[219:01.29]I'm sure whatever it is, it'll be fun.
[219:04.23]But yeah, good night.
[219:05.51]Take care, everybody.
[219:06.49]Thanks for coming out.
[219:07.31]Thanks to everybody that played.
[219:09.86]And I'll see you guys soon.
[219:10.98]Much love, guys.
[219:11.56]Thanks.
[219:11.81]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:12.89]There's a couple subs that I can't leave yet.
[219:15.65]Oh, no, there weren't.
[219:16.81]I already got them.
[219:17.59]Good.
[219:19.33]But thanks for the bits.
[219:20.21]Thanks for the subs.
[219:20.93]You guys all rock.
[219:22.21]If you're new to the stream and you like Overwatch, don't follow this stream.
[219:31.89]Because I'm not going to play it that often and I'm not very good.
[219:34.97]But maybe you'll like hanging out here.
[219:37.61]Then welcome.
[219:39.40]But I'll see you guys on Tuesday, 7 o'clock.
[219:41.53]Good night and goodbye.
