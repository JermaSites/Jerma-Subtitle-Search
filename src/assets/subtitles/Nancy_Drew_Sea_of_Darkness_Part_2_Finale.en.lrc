[00:01.55]Dude, I think, uh... I think my computer's dying.
[00:08.59]Can you get... Hold on, can you hear this?
[00:10.98]Do you hear that?
[00:29.54]It's going like... What the fuck is that?
[00:41.54]Hold on, let me turn up the gain so you can hear it.
[00:43.06]This is freaking me out.
[00:45.44]Alright, I'm going to make no noise to make sure you can hear this.
[00:59.31]Do you hear that?
[01:03.78]No, not the fucking car driving by.
[01:05.72]I have to be careful because a ill-timed vroom will be horrible if I turn this.
[01:18.26]I don't know.
[01:18.58]Anyways, my computer's making a weird noise.
[01:20.76]Who cares?
[01:21.23]We'll just run it into the ground.
[01:24.23]Hi, guys.
[01:24.95]How you doing?
[01:27.90]Hope you all are having a good day.
[01:30.02]Hope you had a good holiday.
[01:31.24]Those of you that celebrated Christmas, hope you had a good Christmas.
[01:34.29]Any other holiday that you happen to celebrate.
[01:37.39]Uh, mine was good.
[01:39.95]Uh, I spent the last few days, besides Christmas obviously, the last two days in a row I've been doing something very important.
[01:48.91]And if we could get a link, please, for the New Year's Eve stream 2019 nominations.
[01:57.45]The voting is live.
[01:59.40]Go vote.
[02:01.50]SurveyMonkey.com slash r slash Jerma n y e 2019.
[02:04.96]There were a lot of nominees.
[02:06.48]There were a lot of categories.
[02:17.31]let's just put it this way um worst noise of the year I believe after combing through and removing some stuff that might should not have been there potentially and putting them all in I think there were 24 nominees and now I think there's like 20 or something that's a lot there's a lot I couldn't remove them though so many of them I can't remove them
[02:47.06]But, uh, they're available, there's source clips for you to check it out, source streams for you to see what the potential worst streams of the year was.
[02:53.97]That stream is gonna be on New Year's Eve.
[02:56.79]So, December 31st, uh, we'll do pretty much the same thing we did last year.
[03:01.76]With the only difference being I might not be in the studio this year, because I might- I don't think I can get the time.
[03:08.08]But I will be in my best suit!
[03:12.99]And we'll just comb our hair.
[03:14.43]I'm gonna be in a tuxedo.
[03:16.80]Instead of at the studio, it's just gonna be me in a tuxedo sitting in my fucking office.
[03:25.08]No budget this year.
[03:26.60]No budget on the New Year's Eve stream this year.
[03:30.13]Accidentally spent it all on the previous streams this year.
[03:36.99]Small budget cut.
[03:44.74]small budget cuts here and there but uh today um let me tweet this out first I said I was gonna play no more heroes today for the wii I'm gonna play them both I remember playing them a long time ago I was gonna do no more heroes but I do I I don't know I can't get my wiimote to connect to my computer through bluetooth I it won't do it I don't know why
[04:13.13]I've been sitting here for the last 20-30 minutes trying to get it to work.
[04:19.16]And, I mean, yes, I am using an emulator.
[04:21.38]That's what I'm doing.
[04:24.42]Uh, I own No More Heroes.
[04:27.06]I, I... Not illegal.
[04:29.90]Not illegal.
[04:30.48]I own this shit!
[04:36.72]Alright, the last time I talked about, you know, I like to use original hardware.
[04:40.08]There was a wave of like, you fucking idiot, just emulate it.
[04:43.26]What are you, stupid?
[04:45.29]And now that I'm trying to emulate it, what are you, a thief?
[04:47.81]Illegal.
[04:48.67]Get the fuck out of here.
[04:49.67]Put him in jail.
[04:56.47]I did play on Wii U on original hardware.
[05:00.06]But here's the thing about No More Heroes.
[05:02.81]Like I said, I own... You've seen me play on the Wii U before.
[05:07.05]I own all this stuff.
[05:08.80]I own No More Heroes, the CD.
[05:11.14]Here's the problem.
[05:12.46]That game looks so fucking awful and plays so awfully on the original hardware.
[05:21.86]It's... No, I refuse to stream it on original hardware.
[05:28.14]That game runs at like 16 FPS at 480p.
[05:33.40]It really does.
[05:36.02]And they did remake.
[05:37.04]They made a PS3 version.
[05:38.26]But here's the problem.
[05:40.02]They didn't remake the second one.
[05:43.74]No More Heroes 2 is only on the Wii.
[05:46.55]I don't... Why didn't they not do them both?
[05:55.05]So what would end up happening is I would go from, oh, look at the PS3 version.
[05:58.44]It's like HD and looks good.
[06:00.58]Okay, now let's go to No More Heroes 2.
[06:02.70]And it's like 480p and runs at 12 FPS.
[06:09.24]Play it who cares about quality.
[06:10.58]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:12.30]That game's hard.
[06:13.83]Do you understand how angry I would get if I played that on original Wii?
[06:19.31]I would be so angry.
[06:21.54]I would die, like, 15 times to the same boss because, like, the FPS dropped to, like, 22.
[06:26.28]And I'd be like, that's the FPS!
[06:31.85]So, uh, I'm gonna get that set up.
[06:35.11]I'm gonna try to figure out, I'm gonna get a new dongle or something for my Wiimote because, um, I just, I don't understand.
[06:44.41]Like, this is, this is, this Wiimote is not broken or anything.
[06:49.80]Shouldn't be.
[06:55.20]Like, it's a Wiimote.
[06:56.60]It's like, hey, look, it's a Wiimote.
[06:59.30]I'm trying to connect to your computer.
[07:01.78]I don't understand.
[07:04.72]He's naked.
[07:10.05]Did you replace the batteries?
[07:11.15]Yeah, there's brand new batteries in here.
[07:14.23]I think it's my computer.
[07:15.39]My computer's Bluetooth just sucks.
[07:18.97]I figured it was just going to work, but what a unit.
[07:21.23]Hey, thanks.
[07:26.16]you ever want to play gta casino hit me up I'll invite you to my arcade you can play on my machines that sounds fun is he flexing sometimes so instead of just scrambling what here's here's what was going to happen I was going to drive to just go get a bluetooth dongle
[07:49.78]But it's like 4 o'clock.
[07:52.72]I'm not doing that right now.
[07:54.20]I'm just going to do Drew Crew.
[07:57.24]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[07:58.26]I'll try it again tomorrow.
[08:00.32]And look, if for some reason I can't get it to work, then we're just going to play the original one anyways.
[08:05.15]Or the PS3 one.
[08:05.97]I'll figure it out by tomorrow.
[08:09.25]So let's get Drew Crew on here.
[08:14.09]This is where we left off.
[08:15.88]I don't know what any of these really mean.
[08:17.86]Let me just make sure I say Drew Crew.
[08:21.08]So people know what I'm streaming.
[08:26.18]But alright, those of you computer friends in here, let me ask you this.
[08:32.34]Why would, so when I open up my Bluetooth and it's like, looking for Bluetooth devices, why does it find a wireless speaker set from like six houses down the road, but it won't find my Wiimote?
[08:52.27]I don't understand.
[08:52.95]Is there something wrong?
[08:58.74]Use the red button?
[08:59.54]Yeah, the sync button.
[09:01.86]It's because Bluetooth sucks.
[09:05.62]Wiimotes aren't Bluetooth?
[09:07.00]Yeah, they are.
[09:07.40]Dude, the Wii is like 20 years old.
[09:12.04]Yeah, but still.
[09:14.30]It's a Bluetooth device.
[09:19.07]Dude, the Wii is 20 years old.
[09:21.63]Alright, I need to, like... I need to start streaming.
[09:30.22]I'm actually kind of glad that we're doing Drew Crew tonight, because... Getting those nominations ready, and...
[09:37.31]Bringing in editors to put videos and start like it's it's been like a kind of a two-day process here So I'm glad we can just the Wiimote is infrared Yeah, there's an infrared camera on it, but the device is Bluetooth.
[09:48.60]It's actually a blue.
[09:50.02]You don't think I know my computer technology Let me just wait that Okay The what do you mean the Wiimote is Bluetooth it's a different Bluetooth version I
[10:06.66]Alright, well, do I need to get, like, a special Wii, like a, what, like a Bluetooth 2 or something dongle?
[10:13.24]Just get a Wii.
[10:14.24]I... Alright, I think this is where we left off.
[10:24.00]Jerma, why are you playing on original hardware?
[10:26.46]Just get an emulator.
[10:27.84]Jerma, get an emulator.
[10:30.13]They're so much better.
[10:32.08]Why are you not playing on the original hardware?
[10:34.10]What's wrong with you?
[10:35.06]Just get away.
[10:36.54]Why use Dolphin?
[10:37.52]What's wrong with you?
[10:38.84]Oh my god, he's insane.
[10:41.27]I told him this a long time ago.
[10:43.01]Why didn't he listen to me?
[10:49.41]Don't worry, nobody even remembers any of this shit, so I'll give you a quick... Look, here's a quick rundown of what happened to Nancy Drew so far.
[10:56.53]There was a crash.
[10:58.33]Somebody crashed.
[11:00.05]Oh, you can't hear it.
[11:00.65]Now you can.
[11:03.13]No sounds?
[11:03.73]Ah, it's all good.
[11:05.09]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[11:07.11]Alright, let me try to give it as best as I can.
[11:10.21]Um... Somebody crashed the boat into the harbor.
[11:12.21]Or something.
[11:13.11]What?
[11:24.05]Alright, so I crashed into the harbor.
[11:26.99]And we're trying to figure out who crashed the boat into the harbor.
[11:33.23]Why did somebody crash into the harbor?
[11:34.83]I don't remember any of this stuff.
[11:37.73]Okay, find Dagny.
[11:38.89]Figure out the importance of the contents of the footlocker.
[11:41.79]Good thing they have this.
[11:42.57]Got that one.
[11:43.40]I gotta find Dagny.
[11:51.40]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[11:51.94]Dagny ran away because Dagny was responsible for all this shit.
[11:57.47]And let's take... Oh, that was a cell phone.
[11:58.77]That was a cell phone.
[12:01.25]Did we know what the password is yet?
[12:02.47]Did we figure this out?
[12:07.25]When did this game come out?
[12:12.18]I have no idea.
[12:13.82]2013? 2013?
[12:20.68]Password is Puffin.
[12:24.68]No, it's not.
[12:27.18]Where would I get this info from?
[12:28.27]Yeah, she knocked this over.
[12:35.57]Wait, there's a blood trail.
[12:36.91]All the blood?
[12:38.07]Alright, it's the guy with the beard.
[12:42.53]Go find the guy with the beard and say, hey, there's footprints.
[12:48.02]Give me the password to her phone.
[12:51.85]Alright, I'm going to give you something strange that's happening in my brain right now.
[12:55.17]This is very strange.
[12:59.55]I feel like I haven't left from last time.
[13:06.12]I'm still streaming from the last time I streamed this.
[13:10.61]This is not a second stream, this is the same stream.
[13:15.61]That's weird.
[13:17.71]Alright.
[13:18.97]Do you know where Dagny is?
[13:20.31]I'm stuck in a dream.
[13:20.91]That didn't help at all.
[13:22.45]Alright.
[13:23.79]So I have a tiny key.
[13:49.52]Alright, souvenirs.
[13:50.52]Right, I have, like, I have toys and shit in here.
[13:53.15]Hook?
[13:54.01]Have I still not figured out what to do with the hook?
[13:59.67]No, he, no, he doesn't know.
[14:01.05]No, no, not at all.
[14:02.21]I, like, absolute zero.
[14:05.03]Hold on, like, I need to, uh, pull up the walkthrough for a second.
[14:08.96]I know, Drew Crew, don't worry.
[14:11.36]Right now, like, 200 people's mouths just dropped.
[14:14.80]I'm not cheating.
[14:17.29]I'm just trying to find where we left off.
[14:20.11]I'm not, this is not cheating.
[14:22.11]This is just finding where we left off.
[14:27.81]Alright, let me just go down to where we were.
[14:31.18]This looks pretty accurate.
[14:36.98]Alright, yeah, the guy came out with a knife, right?
[14:39.92]He came out and he was like, and he tried to stab me.
[14:42.63]And then he walked away.
[14:43.25]That's where we left off.
[14:43.93]That's like the last thing that happened, right?
[14:45.65]Okay.
[14:45.77]Okay.
[14:48.39]Alright, now we have to go... I gotta go to the crow's nest.
[14:51.51]Because I remember he was like, go to the crow's nest!
[14:53.97]And I was like, okay.
[14:54.81]Alright, where's that cultural center?
[15:03.27]Put on lipstick.
[15:05.47]No, I'm not gonna say anything.
[15:07.39]About anything.
[15:09.15]Here's the thing, I know I saw this in the pre-stream chat and it was actually kind of funny.
[15:13.62]Yeah guys, I'm not making any jokes until 2020.
[15:17.23]I'm not saying a thing.
[15:20.41]Because there's no more nominations.
[15:21.81]So this is just wasted effort for me to make a joke.
[15:25.23]Why would I do that?
[15:27.79]It can't be used in this year.
[15:29.71]It can't be used next year either.
[15:31.37]I should just not turn my stream on until December 31st.
[15:35.55]This is not canon.
[15:37.53]Again, not canon.
[15:50.11]We're in joke purgatory.
[15:51.59]Okay, well, I just got this.
[15:56.67]I can't... I can't make it... Because if I say something... If something happens... Okay, let's just say that, like, Nancy Drew... I don't know, like, drives down the road and, like, hits me with a car and I fall into the water or something.
[16:10.49]And, like, I climb out of the water and I talk about, like, a water joke.
[16:13.21]I don't know.
[16:13.69]And then, like, people go, holy shit, that was ridiculous.
[16:15.47]That was the most ridiculous moment of the whole year.
[16:16.96]It's like, well, that's too bad.
[16:22.27]It's not going to come up next year.
[16:23.31]Alright.
[16:26.87]I need the history book.
[16:29.73]The crow's nest, which stands in the center of the skip rot today, adorned the original ship at one point.
[16:37.76]But was carted off to serve as a watchtower.
[16:39.88]Dubbed Old Stolka, it had remained on display in off-limits to tourists for over a hundred years.
[16:45.24]This is it.
[16:45.86]Solution is to divide into groups of six.
[16:49.06]No group touching another.
[16:52.90]Divided into groups of six?
[16:56.62]What are you talking about?
[16:57.50]Groups of six.
[17:00.00]Oh.
[17:00.57]Like that.
[17:03.49]Like that.
[17:03.93]Okay, so that's a group of six.
[17:05.21]That's a group of six.
[17:07.37]Somebody just said, I just want to say, fuck the Dru crew.
[17:11.01]Uh... I... I don't know what to say about that.
[17:17.60]Because...
[17:20.12]They've taken over.
[17:21.58]There's not much I can say.
[17:25.73]Group six, right?
[17:35.23]Shit.
[17:35.57]Hold on.
[17:38.22]Done.
[17:38.62]Got it.
[17:38.86]Wait, where's the last one?
[17:44.52]This is a Druid.
[17:45.42]This is a Druid crew stream.
[17:46.76]Rise up.
[17:48.74]Wait, what is this?
[17:50.22]Groups of six?
[17:53.28]How do I not have that?
[17:59.74]Make one.
[18:01.16]Look on the right.
[18:03.08]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[18:04.12]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:08.26]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[18:11.02]Divide the board into groups of six with no group touching another.
[18:16.03]1, 2, 3.
[18:18.43]1, 2, 3.
[18:18.49]1, 2, 3.
[18:18.73]1, 2, 3.
[18:19.17]1, 2, 3.
[18:20.79]What'd I get wrong?
[18:23.95]You're missing one?
[18:24.73]What?
[18:28.92]I need a... Oh, I get it.
[18:32.42]Okay, hold on.
[18:33.64]I have to... So these can't be moved.
[18:35.38]Oh, I get you.
[18:36.00]I get you.
[18:36.48]Watch this.
[18:36.90]Drew crew.
[18:38.28]Can we get some... I'm gonna get a fucking new emote called Drew's.
[18:43.09]Jerma Drew's.
[18:46.72]Why am I, like, pandering right now?
[18:48.44]Like, I've played this, I've played Nancy Drew, like, twice on stream.
[18:52.88]What's the point of me pandering?
[18:54.84]To, you know, like, this is, like, only the third time you've ever seen, I've streamed, like, Sekiro more times in this game, and I don't have a Sekiro emote.
[19:01.90]What the fuck am I talking about?
[19:02.96]I streamed, like, Red Dead Redemption 2, like, seven times.
[19:11.81]Alright, here we go.
[19:14.20]He's pandering.
[19:15.26]Panda to the crew.
[19:17.94]Remove all this.
[19:18.84]This might be a while.
[19:20.44]No.
[19:20.64]If I go like this... I need... Hold on.
[19:41.70]I need to fit one... Two more?
[19:48.21]Fuck.
[19:48.75]Alright.
[19:54.07]Tennis ball noises?
[19:55.81]Let me imitate that.
[19:57.36]No.
[19:58.46]I can't risk having the fucking best noise of the year.
[20:00.42]Are you serious?
[20:02.64]That's all back-loaded.
[20:07.22]Well, maybe I should try to do, like, a really cool noise.
[20:13.05]And see if anybody remembers in a year.
[20:21.37]You could make this the worst stream of the year if I wanted to.
[20:27.84]I don't know.
[20:28.82]Should I?
[20:29.34]Could I?
[20:30.08]Should I just game everything?
[20:32.36]Well, because now you can't vote for it.
[20:40.81]Oh, no.
[20:41.37]More Drew puzzles.
[20:42.37]I got it.
[20:42.91]Don't worry.
[20:43.33]I got this.
[20:46.69]I'm not gonna make this... We just got started.
[20:49.33]It's been like 15 minutes.
[20:51.51]You are... Look, how could this be the worst stream of the year?
[20:54.37]You already got like a fuck the Wiimote rant in the first 10 minutes.
[20:58.61]That can't be the worst stream of the year.
[21:00.05]What are you talking about?
[21:07.29]True.
[21:08.53]Alright, let's keep going.
[21:13.21]I think this is good.
[21:14.89]I think all this is good, except maybe here.
[21:22.89]How did they ever expect?
[21:23.95]I need a clean slate over here.
[21:30.97]I definitely could not do this when I was younger.
[21:35.31]No way.
[21:37.21]I wouldn't have.
[21:37.99]Would you?
[21:38.85]Would you have done this?
[21:41.07]No, you wouldn't have.
[21:42.53]You would have opened up like Mario instead.
[21:45.15]You would have gotten this far and gone... I want to play Ninja Turtles.
[21:51.56]Because that was more fun for you.
[21:56.73]I would have just closed this and opened up Turtles in Time.
[21:59.79]Which is... I mean, I think I've played that game 500 times.
[22:03.13]From the age of like 13 to like 16.
[22:07.85]Do that right now.
[22:10.82]I'm not gonna do that right... What?
[22:13.50]I'm not gonna play Turtles in Time right now.
[22:17.24]I mean, it is one of the best games ever made, but I can't, I'm not gonna do that right now.
[22:21.18]I'm not gonna do that right now!
[22:32.67]I'm not doing it right now.
[22:33.83]I'm not doing it right now.
[22:34.83]I'm not gonna betray the Druid crew.
[22:41.44]I'm not gonna go get turtles in time right now.
[22:46.05]Do it later?
[22:46.77]No, that's like a whole stream.
[22:48.19]I can do that game on hard, by the way.
[23:09.28]Fuck.
[23:09.72]Okay, hold on.
[23:11.98]How do I make this two?
[23:20.39]He's so bad.
[23:22.65]You wouldn't have done this.
[23:23.53]You would have gone out and played tetherball.
[23:29.84]You wouldn't have done this.
[23:32.36]I know because I wouldn't have done it.
[23:34.48]And I still can't do it at 34.
[23:37.38]I want to go outside and play tetherball.
[23:40.74]Fuck Turtles in Time.
[23:42.12]If there was a tetherball court behind me, I would go do it right now.
[23:51.55]It wouldn't even be Turtles in Time.
[23:52.83]It would be, I'm gonna go play Tetherball.
[23:56.43]Wait, hold on.
[23:56.81]Shit.
[24:07.71]How do I make another little one in here?
[24:17.98]I know this is right.
[24:19.36]I know it is.
[24:21.74]This guy actually went outside as a kid.
[24:26.68]Yeah, and I got hurt a bunch of times.
[24:28.90]And now apparently I'm paying the price for it.
[24:32.39]Because my rib cage hurts every day.
[24:35.03]So... Maybe you should play fucking Nancy Drew.
[24:52.25]Wait, I'm a... Bottom right doesn't need that upper dot.
[24:57.88]Doesn't?
[24:58.84]I can't take that one off.
[25:01.14]The ones that are... The one with the pegs on them are the ones that can't be... Split the bottom right into two.
[25:09.03]How?
[25:15.91]I don't know.
[25:19.71]This is not possible.
[25:20.85]I mean, it has to be possible because an eighth grade girl beat it.
[25:25.01]It has to be possible.
[25:37.90]Hold on, let me get, let me do, no, no click maps.
[25:40.00]I'm doing this one on my own.
[25:48.15]No, this is right.
[25:53.77]No, no, no, no, no!
[25:54.51]Shit!
[25:54.73]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[25:55.53]I did it on my own!
[25:57.59]Now I'm just gonna figure out how to make these two.
[26:03.61]Oh, shit.
[26:04.89]YES!
[26:11.83]An ice pack?
[26:18.32]Uh, so am I gonna help him?
[26:19.52]Or am I just gonna say, oh no?
[26:25.18]Okay, what was the point of that?
[26:26.64]Wooden gear.
[26:27.28]Alright, let's go talk to him.
[26:30.28]Let's see what's wrong with him.
[26:34.06]You alright?
[26:38.16]Oh, um, hi.
[26:44.16]Uh, what happened?
[26:45.10]What happened to your face?
[26:47.26]Gunner happened.
[26:49.00]Specifically, Gunner threw a bottle at me.
[26:52.61]That's awful.
[26:53.47]Why would he do that?
[26:54.65]Fuck.
[26:55.19]Does he need a reason?
[26:56.57]It's happened twice before.
[26:58.53]Now do you see what I've had to deal with all these years?
[27:01.27]A lesser man than I would have packed his things and quietly retired to a nice beach somewhere.
[27:06.29]I could easily take my work to Reykjavik.
[27:09.76]I don't know why I stay.
[27:11.50]You could, but you won't.
[27:12.86]You've got a great thing going on here.
[27:17.11]You've got fucking a whole business here.
[27:20.27]I'll take care of that motherfucker, don't worry.
[27:22.08]Dagny is missing.
[27:23.40]I'm worried something happened to her.
[27:25.44]Missing?
[27:26.64]Are you sure she didn't go for a stroll?
[27:28.62]No, she's gone.
[27:31.36]She hasn't left the heater even once the entire time I've been here.
[27:35.60]That's suspicious.
[27:38.72]If she hasn't returned soon, I'll organize a search party.
[27:41.68]In the meantime, try not to worry.
[27:43.75]She's a tough woman.
[27:44.95]I'm certain she'll manage.
[27:46.21]Goodbye.
[27:48.22]You stay here.
[27:49.40]You got a whole thing going on here.
[27:52.65]I'll take care of that motherfucker.
[27:53.79]Where is he?
[28:05.00]Hey.
[28:05.38]Good day.
[28:07.03]You throwing bottles now?
[28:08.55]Why did you hit Sorin?
[28:10.41]Hit Sorin?
[28:11.83]He said you threw a bottle at him.
[28:14.09]I did no wailing, tailing, ting of the sort.
[28:17.17]He's a liar is what he is, and he's trying to make Old Gunnar look bad.
[28:21.64]Hmm.
[28:24.42]Uh-oh.
[28:26.14]He said it's not the first time that's happened.
[28:27.68]He said it's not the first time this has happened between you two.
[28:31.29]Why would I stop?
[28:32.54]Why would I stop there?
[28:35.74]Why would I stop there?
[28:36.88]Why would I stop there?
[28:57.52]Hey, did you throw a bottle at that guy?
[28:59.72]No, he's a liar.
[29:01.32]Okay.
[29:02.76]You sure?
[29:03.20]He said you've thrown bottles at him, like, more than once.
[29:06.97]No.
[29:08.31]Okay, have a good day.
[29:09.91]That's it?
[29:11.69]Yeah, run along, girl.
[29:12.93]Okay.
[29:15.17]What?
[29:15.65]There's nothing else for me to say here?
[29:20.76]Why would I have nothing else to say?
[29:26.35]I need this password.
[29:35.90]What do I do with this?
[29:39.28]It's not 1234.
[29:39.58]It's not 1234.
[29:39.88]I know it's not.
[29:40.38]I'm 99% positive it's not 1234.
[29:42.02]It might be 4321.
[29:42.62]But I don't think so.
[29:56.72]How was my Christmas?
[29:57.40]It was great.
[29:57.90]I hope yours was good, too.
[30:00.27]Did you try it?
[30:01.09]No?
[30:01.43]Alright, I'm gonna- I'll try the damn one- Alright, I'll try it.
[30:04.33]Here.
[30:11.25]If that worked, I would've been so mad.
[30:12.73]Alright.
[30:18.97]Let's go- Let's go back to the cabin.
[30:26.18]Didn't I get something?
[30:26.74]I got something out of a dog bed, so let me go there.
[30:36.86]Fuck this boat, by the way.
[30:39.18]It's so easy just to turn around on this boat, and I'm trying to go over here.
[30:43.45]I'm just trying to go this... Alright, can you... First this boat.
[30:52.61]I was supposed to beat this before Christmas.
[30:56.06]But I got so fucked up.
[30:58.06]You know, I had a lot of things going on.
[31:00.10]Alright, let's go to the captain's quarters.
[31:04.84]What the fuck does this thing do?
[31:09.29]I still don't know what this thing does.
[31:12.03]Not a single clue on Earth.
[31:19.05]Uh... 0, 1, 2, 3?
[31:20.99]Maybe.
[31:21.29]Maybe.
[31:32.19]Hold on a minute.
[31:33.95]I'm just looking up the walkthrough.
[31:35.79]I'm just kidding.
[31:37.49]I need to get to a fucking puzzle.
[31:39.45]We have so much stuff going on.
[31:42.31]There's so much stuff.
[31:43.67]I have so much stuff in my inventory.
[31:44.97]I haven't played this in like seven days.
[31:47.71]Let's just get on the right track.
[31:49.19]It's okay to be on training wheels as long as eventually you take them off.
[31:54.04]He's a shameless cheater.
[31:55.28]Call it what you want.
[31:56.90]I call it, uh, filling potential dead air.
[32:02.03]It's just to get us on the right track.
[32:04.11]You can take the wheels off soon.
[32:10.61]Alright.
[32:11.75]The password is the wacky digits on the back of your mom's credit card.
[32:24.01]Oh, is it?
[32:25.59]I get it.
[32:27.45]Yeah, yeah, it's a bunch of crazy funny numbers.
[32:29.71]Go ahead and read them to me.
[32:32.41]God damn it.
[32:35.43]Alright.
[32:37.93]What is this for?
[32:47.76]That was the best chat joke 2019.
[32:49.30]That ain't even a category.
[32:51.12]You guys can put that one if you want.
[32:57.98]What is this?
[33:03.31]I should be able to interact with this.
[33:04.53]I don't understand.
[33:12.95]I should be able to click on this.
[33:19.52]What the fuck?
[33:31.72]XD, this guy sucks.
[33:34.54]Shh.
[33:35.38]Shh!
[33:36.36]Ow!
[33:42.14]I did so much of this shit out of order.
[33:43.76]You have to- you have to have, like, been told to go to the bed frame for the bed frame to be activated.
[33:49.55]So I have to scroll back up this walkthrough and find the note that Dad left me for what's in the bed frame.
[33:58.27]You know what I'm saying?
[34:00.28]I can't just click on the bed frame.
[34:03.68]He's using a walkthrough.
[34:04.66]I'm just trying to get us to a spot where we're alright.
[34:07.48]I'm going to type in bed frame into find on this page.
[34:11.54]Bed frame.
[34:14.54]Here we go.
[34:15.59]Alright.
[34:16.71]Got it.
[34:17.05]There's a note here.
[34:24.13]Something about a bed frame.
[34:33.58]Oh, there's a bed frame note.
[34:35.33]Magnus' notes.
[34:38.67]Find all five pieces to reveal a box pattern.
[34:46.83]That's the note, right?
[34:56.65]Okay, slow down.
[34:57.51]I can't freak out here.
[35:03.21]I'm gonna relax.
[35:03.95]Because we're so out of water.
[35:12.67]Dude, I have to go back to when there was a struggle.
[35:16.95]I know- I-
[35:42.99]I cheated.
[35:43.49]How did I get it wrong?
[35:49.96]I am cheating right now.
[35:51.40]How am I getting this wrong?
[35:55.44]Scuttlebutt.
[35:58.34]Scuttlebutt.
[36:01.56]It's Scuttlebutt.
[36:02.62]The password is Scuttlebutt.
[36:04.79]Enter.
[36:07.49]So...
[36:09.29]I have to read the clue for what the password is.
[36:13.84]If I get the password right, it doesn't work unless I have read the clue for what the password is.
[36:18.62]So... If Dagny told me what her password is... Hey, uh, I gotta, I wanna look something up.
[36:28.24]What's your password?
[36:29.77]Oh, uh, it's scuttlebutt.
[36:31.79]Well, that didn't work.
[36:33.19]Oh, sorry, let me write it down on a piece of paper for you, and then you look at it, and then you can get in my phone.
[36:40.03]I'm getting anti-cheated, but where's the note?
[36:42.55]Give me the fucking... Okay.
[36:45.23]We did this so out of order, it's not even funny.
[36:47.39]Okay, we have to do... Dagny's note, where is it?
[36:51.94]Where's these notes?
[36:53.28]God damn it.
[36:54.04]Alright, let's go.
[36:54.84]Drew Crew, assemble.
[36:56.38]Here we go.
[37:01.72]Imagine hiding gameplay mechanics behind finding notes in the world.
[37:07.72]What the hell?
[37:10.89]Okay, read Dagny's note.
[37:16.41]Look at the barrels.
[37:17.89]Okay, explore the hold of what?
[37:20.77]Dude, this is back up when we did the crossword puzzle.
[37:29.71]Imagine cheating in a Nancy Drew game.
[37:32.77]Imagine needing to cheat in a Nancy Drew game.
[37:34.91]That's what you should be saying.
[37:40.90]Dagny left her suitcase at the cultural center.
[37:42.90]She also... Okay, so... Didn't I already... I have this note!
[37:46.70]Don't I have this fucking thing?
[37:54.13]What?
[38:03.19]Hey, can you, like, go walk away again or something?
[38:05.57]Sorin's using the desk right now.
[38:12.18]It's not even a puzzle.
[38:13.22]It's just you gotta, like, open the right container and find the right note to tell you to click on the puzzle.
[38:21.15]What?
[38:22.21]What?
[38:23.15]What?
[38:24.05]What?
[38:28.61]Where the fuck is this note?
[38:29.73]I'm gonna actually get pissed off at this game.
[38:33.13]Dagny's note.
[38:36.84]Okay, explore... What's the hold?
[38:40.64]Explore the hold.
[38:42.59]Go down the stairs at right, enter through the door.
[38:45.23]Look close at barrels, examine the middle barrel bottom.
[38:49.99]Dagny's note is in there.
[38:55.96]Why in the name of God would there be a note?
[38:59.38]What are you talking about?
[39:01.42]Like this barrel here?
[39:26.22]Exit and go down the stairs at right.
[39:28.00]Enter through the door.
[39:29.84]Look close at the barrels.
[39:34.60]Wait, hold on.
[39:35.45]You're talking about over here?
[39:40.13]This game is on drugs.
[39:43.83]I'm definitely not on drugs.

[46:05.49]You can't nominate it for anything.
[46:07.03]You can't nominate it for anything.
[46:08.33]The poll is closed.
[46:09.49]You can't nominate it to anything.
[46:12.05]You can't nominate it.
[46:13.63]It's over.
[46:14.23]It's not nominatable.
[46:15.79]It's not on that list.
[46:16.77]You can't nominate it.

[46:25.73]And I'll never be nominated.
[46:27.03]Holy shit.
[46:27.71]I got a free pass for whatever I want.
[46:43.77]What?
[46:47.81]What is going on?

[46:51.14]I don't understand how that works.
[46:53.08]What is this?

[46:55.40]A year and a date?
[46:57.00]I don't know.

[47:48.30]Got it.
[47:48.88]You did this.
[47:50.88]Get me out of here.
[48:07.15]Worst joke of 2019.
[48:07.61]You can't nominate that for anything.
[48:09.95]And I don't even think that's the case.

[48:27.88]Pain in the ass.
[48:36.89]I don't think that's that bad.
[48:40.60]I think I would laugh at that if I was me.
[48:45.42]What are these images?
[48:47.74]This is fucking funny.
[49:07.39]No, not that.
[49:12.49]No, it's this one.
[49:15.29]This is the best image of the year, but it's too bad.
[49:17.29]None of this counts.
[49:19.47]Like, none of it counts.

[50:13.07]It looks like I'm eating something.
[50:14.05]I look like a gerbil or a hamster.
[50:15.37]It's like a hamster with ice cream sandwiches storing them for winter.
[50:18.41]Ugh.
[50:37.55]Okay.
[50:37.67]I'm not on drugs, I don't do drugs.
[50:38.87]Alright.
[50:39.11]So what is this for?
[51:09.34]It's a metal crank.
[51:10.90]What was that for?
[51:11.48]Hey, can I nominate this stream so far as best stream of the year?
[51:25.19]Something about Nancy Drew.
[51:26.89]I don't know what Nancy Drew does to me.
[51:30.77]It's like I go fucking crazy.
[51:33.09]I don't know what it is.
[51:34.41]You know what I'm saying?
[51:35.57]What's with this?
[51:41.11]There we go, alright.
[51:50.86]What's the first thing we do?
[51:51.54]Messages?
[51:53.46]Let's check on the bank.
[51:56.04]This is an automatic account text.
[51:57.56]Please confirm your bank account deposit of $2,455 with attached message.
[52:03.45]For Gulf Coast Treasure Find.
[52:05.99]Confirm.
[52:07.71]This is the automatic account text.
[52:09.41]Please confirm your bank deposit of $5,500 from Mr. Fallon for Santa Fe investigation results.
[52:17.02]Confirm.
[52:19.88]$12,000 from Lure for Petra extraction.
[52:22.80]Am I incriminating myself?
[52:23.86]Is she just incriminating herself with her bank app?
[52:30.04]Why would you put this in the notes?
[52:37.82]Why wouldn't you just use code words or something?
[52:41.40]Why wouldn't you say, like, this is for cleaning up after the cat, if you know what I mean.
[52:46.78]Like, oh, okay.
[52:47.86]Why, like, for Lou, for Petra extraction.
[52:52.16]This is all illegal shit, right?
[52:56.26]Yeah, there's an, I'm talking about the attached message, not the bank.
[53:01.50]The automated bank app wouldn't be like, yeah, this is for, this is for, would you, you know,
[53:10.01]It's million.
[53:11.47]5.5 million.
[53:16.79]Whatever.
[53:17.13]I moved the decimal point.
[53:18.07]I don't care.
[53:22.62]Very excited for the Maiden Voyage.
[53:23.72]The deck looks darling.
[53:24.64]I put you into our festival donor section as Mrs. Dagny Silva de Soto.
[53:31.24]Just Dagny Silva now, thanks.
[53:32.66]Turns out my life partner wasn't so lifey after all.
[53:36.48]Alicia's returned to the States.
[53:37.60]I thought she was talking about how they were dead.
[53:40.68]Okay.
[53:42.74]I had no idea.
[53:43.28]Terribly, terribly sorry to hear that.
[53:44.46]Condolences.
[53:45.16]Plenty of fish in the sea.
[53:46.20]Single and ready to mingle.
[53:47.20]No time like the present.
[53:48.14]You're an absolute gem, etc.
[53:49.53]Alright, buddy.
[53:51.75]Fucking relax.
[53:53.69]It's fine.
[53:54.55]I always do.
[53:55.09]I'll survive.
[53:55.71]Just leave me alone.
[54:02.59]Fuck out of here, dude.
[54:06.27]Alright, what about Magnus?
[54:09.27]Something's following me.
[54:10.19]Lock everything down.
[54:12.52]Okay, Mr. Melodramatic, are we starting to just get a little paranoid?
[54:15.36]What about the dock pylon?
[54:16.76]Are you dropping that?
[54:18.28]I'm serious.
[54:19.70]You'll have to wait on the final piece we discussed.
[54:22.62]What?
[54:22.88]I'm not going to do accents.
[54:23.80]It's going to be a boorst impression and you can't even vote for it.
[54:25.98]So, you know what?
[54:26.48]Well, fuck it.
[54:26.82]I don't even care.
[54:28.43]Where are you putting it?
[54:30.78]Bed frame.
[54:31.28]On the ship.
[54:31.80]Magic circles.
[54:32.86]Venn diagrams.
[54:33.64]The key is the overlapping sections.
[54:36.28]There are five pieces.
[54:37.08]You have one.
[54:37.70]I have one.
[54:38.44]Where are the remaining three?
[54:39.41]How could they have gotten so lost?
[54:42.17]You're not making sense.
[54:42.99]Calm down.
[54:43.47]Have a breath.
[54:44.03]Eat some... Eat a banana.
[54:45.33]Alright, now I can actually go to the bed thing.
[54:48.51]That's all I wanted.
[55:02.98]By the way, if you do have a strong opinion on anything, I recommend you go take a few minutes of your time if you feel like it to vote for the 23 different categories for worst and best of the year for 2019.
[55:20.60]Check out that SurveyMonkey link.
[55:21.72]That is a real link.
[55:23.40]Check it out.
[55:25.13]Probably take you, because there's a lot of clips.
[55:27.92]There's a lot to go through, so maybe take your time with it.
[55:32.33]Make sure, because once you vote, that's it.
[55:34.71]And we will see the results on New Year's Eve.
[55:40.24]Why are you still using SurveyMonkey?
[55:41.78]Because the $400 yearly activation went through automatically three or four months ago, because I didn't cancel it.
[55:51.07]So that's why.
[55:54.35]But I might as well use the damn thing.
[56:02.07]Yeah.
[56:02.61]Yeah.
[56:03.11]I know.
[56:03.71]Yeah.
[56:04.13]And guess what?
[56:05.91]I probably will forget to cancel it again after this stream because I will be kind of over that stream and moving on to the next stuff.
[56:13.56]And we'll see you next year when I have not canceled my Survey Monkey ridiculously overpriced hundreds of dollars per year subscription.
[56:24.13]Pictures of a blank wall.
[56:26.63]Cancel it now.
[56:27.05]I can't.
[56:27.25]I'm busy.
[56:39.16]Alright, the back wall?
[56:41.34]Alright, let's go back to the captain's quarters.
[56:46.12]So now I can actually look at the bed.
[56:48.28]That fucking troopey picture is so funny.
[56:52.89]He's too busy to save $400.
[56:54.17]Well, I already lost $400.
[56:57.41]I can't get that back.
[56:58.25]That went through like four months ago.
[57:01.63]So I have like seven months to not spend $400 again.
[57:16.69]Why is it so bright?
[57:22.39]This is- this is Droopy the dog, like, going to heaven.
[57:26.58]Droopy the dog.
[57:30.02]Alright, this is Droopy the dog, like, does too much Molly.
[57:36.66]What the fuck?
[57:40.27]Droopy the dog does too- smokes too much crack and like goes to heaven.
[57:48.84]What the fuck?
[57:51.34]Ugh!
[57:54.19]Hold on, hold on.
[58:21.23]This is so fun.
[58:24.61]Let's try this one.
[58:25.45]Let's try this one.
[58:27.81]This is fucking fun.
[58:29.00]Hold on, where is it?
[58:36.68]I just saved it.
[58:37.36]Where the fuck is it?
[58:39.54]Where's my other drooping the dog image that I just saved?
[58:52.29]You're literally an Oblivion character?
[59:01.35]Okay, I have to fucking focus for a second.
[59:09.62]You need to do that as an emote.
[59:11.12]Alright, everybody relax.
[59:18.64]We're good.
[59:19.82]Let's go back to where we were going.
[59:23.06]Check out the bed.
[59:27.22]Which is right here.
[59:29.78]Here we go.
[59:30.88]Oh, this is gonna be great.
[59:36.83]Can't wait for this one.
[59:40.61]I'm just scratching my back.
[59:42.95]It's fucking really itchy.
[59:44.05]Okay.
[59:45.23]Okay, I got it.
[59:47.72]I need to place the numbers inside the circle so that they add up to the totals within the overlapping sections.
[59:53.56]Okay, so what?
[59:54.28]Place the numbers so that any total shown in the overlapping sections is the sum of those circles' individual numbers.
[60:01.39]Okay, so whatever is in the circle...
[60:13.45]It's just... So this would be seven.
[60:16.18]Okay.
[60:17.68]But... You gotta... Holy shit.
[60:24.82]This is easy.
[60:27.97]I mean... Oh, I don't... Nothing has to spin.
[60:30.75]Oh, wait, wait.
[60:31.23]No, this is easy.
[60:32.79]Nothing has to spin.
[60:35.23]Cool.
[60:35.85]Alright.
[60:36.05]I thought I had to, like, spin these things around.
[60:37.63]Okay.
[60:41.83]So, let's see.
[60:43.65]The sum of everything in the overlapping circles.
[60:46.45]This would be 33.
[60:48.15]What?
[60:52.17]Total shown in the overlapping is the sum of those individual numbers.
[60:55.41]So, like, it would have to be... We'd have to make 23.
[60:58.75]So that would be...
[61:12.31]I still don't get it.
[61:13.77]I still don't understand.
[61:15.27]I'll get it in a second.
[61:23.00]Alright, this is the last Droopy image for a while, and then we're gonna move on.
[61:28.52]This is the final Droopy the dog.
[61:35.36]This one's pretty damn good, though.
[61:49.84]It's Stroop with the dog hitting his favorite jewel.
[61:59.27]What do you mean not that one?
[62:06.20]Jesus Christ.
[62:11.20]Oh my God.
[62:12.28]How do you do this this quickly?
[62:14.07]How do you even do this this fast?
[62:18.46]It's not even possible to do it this fast.
[62:21.44]It's been like 12 minutes.
[62:25.50]This is ridiculous.
[62:40.45]This is now the thumbnail?
[62:41.65]I know it is.
[62:44.03]Right click set as desktop wallpaper.
[62:49.06]Here's one that isn't droopy.
[62:52.54]Oh my fucking god.
[62:53.82]What is going on?
[62:54.74]This is just the Grinch.
[62:59.61]This is like the Grinch with no makeup.
[63:02.65]Eating spaghetti.
[63:08.87]Alright, that's enough.
[63:09.95]That's enough.
[63:10.83]That's enough.
[63:11.28]I'm done.
[63:22.41]Alright, we gotta do this diagram thing.
[63:31.06]Oh, fuck.
[63:32.84]I don't know.
[63:33.30]I don't know.
[63:35.86]I don't know.
[63:37.74]I'm not gonna lie.
[63:38.46]I don't know.
[63:41.59]If it were me... I mean, it is me.
[63:43.59]What do I mean, if it were me?
[63:45.61]It is me.
[63:46.29]So, of course it's me.
[63:48.29]What I would do...
[63:55.53]Place the... So, okay.
[64:01.99]Place the numbers.
[64:03.29]Any totals shown in the overlapping is the sum of the circle... Is the sum of those circles individual... Is the sum... So I need to make... I need to make... 23 here.
[64:15.46]What's 23?
[64:15.90]Like 8, 7, and 9?
[64:16.86]Anybody got a calculator?
[64:28.43]What is 8, 9, and 7?
[64:29.01]What does that do?
[64:36.42]Windows has a calculator?
[64:37.52]I can't.
[64:37.82]I'm too busy.
[64:39.98]He's looking at the answers on the other monitor.
[64:42.16]No, I'm not.
[64:45.84]Just look at the walkthrough.
[64:46.80]No, I'm not doing that.
[64:47.60]Not yet.
[64:48.32]You know?
[64:48.70]Sure.
[64:49.22]No, not yet.
[64:52.05]No, it's... Okay, here we go.
[64:53.87]Alright, so that's 23. 23.
[64:58.83]So now I have to make 10 here, so I need 1.
[65:02.57]And then this needs to be 13.
[65:05.25]7.
[65:06.93]We don't have a 6.
[65:10.70]Wait, no, hold on a minute there.
[65:12.92]Alright.
[65:15.14]This is actually pretty good.
[65:16.20]This is a fun puzzle.
[65:19.51]If, you know, every single puzzle in your entire game is based off of weird, like, logic math problems...
[65:29.61]Okay, now we need to make 10.
[65:31.25]First of all, let's get this to 7.
[65:33.69]So we need to make 7 out of the... Okay.
[65:38.47]There's your 7.
[65:41.65]There's your 5.
[65:43.13]Nope.
[65:45.49]There it is.
[65:47.31]And we get more of these sketches.
[65:48.91]I'm fucking jacked up right now.
[65:50.71]I'm so... I'm so fucking excitable.
[65:54.08]Why?
[65:54.30]I don't know why.
[65:54.88]You know why?
[65:55.44]I'll tell you why.
[65:56.04]Here's why.
[65:56.98]You know why I'm so excitable right now?
[65:59.57]Because that New Year's Eve stream, the nominations are done in there.
[66:02.51]It's votable.
[66:03.99]By the way, if you have some time, if you want to check out those nominations.
[66:11.61]They're there.
[66:12.49]I can't wait.
[66:12.93]That stream's going to be a lot of fun.
[66:15.62]Alright, let's go back to the thing where I can put the... It's like to go back to the cabin in the woods, right?
[66:21.04]Yeah.
[66:23.96]He's plugging it.
[66:28.55]Yeah, you gotta plug the stream that is a big one.
[66:33.28]That's like the biggest stream of the year.
[66:35.62]Don't you want to know what sound is the best sound of the year?
[66:41.58]Don't you want to have weight to find out which Peter was the worst one?
[66:46.31]That one don't count.
[67:03.14]I'm just like in a happy mood right now.
[67:04.66]Because I'm gonna play No More Heroes tomorrow, hopefully.
[67:07.14]Well, I was kind of mad earlier, but not anymore.
[67:11.94]Alright, let's get these.
[67:15.34]What's 3 plus 3 times 3?
[67:16.91]That would be... That would be 6.
[67:19.27]That would be 18.
[67:21.05]Thank you.
[67:25.99]I'm not stupid.
[67:43.03]This song, where is it from?
[67:49.27]That was wrong.
[67:49.87]That was actually wrong.
[67:50.79]What was it though?
[67:54.11]What was the question again?
[68:00.39]This looks like it goes... What the fuck?
[68:14.98]No, this is wrong.
[68:17.66]Still missing a piece?
[68:20.19]This puzzle is stupid.
[68:22.61]North American education?
[68:24.25]LOL.
[68:24.69]Yeah.
[68:25.39]Yeah, you know what would be great?
[68:28.41]If we could redo our entire educational system.
[68:31.26]That's correct.
[68:36.28]We need it.
[68:46.62]we need better schooling we need better we need better schools in this country see if I was a presidential candidate I would get on stage right and during like the debates Mr Elbertson sorry excuse me Senator Elbertson uh during your time in Senator you you made very clear that you would like to have a educational reform can you explain why that's your policy
[69:09.60]And I would simply say, yeah, I will tell you exactly why.
[69:13.00]I'm 41 and do not know my multiplication tables.
[69:18.89]I didn't know how to write a check until I was 20.
[69:21.57]And I still don't understand at all.
[69:30.77]And then I would stop and I would freeze for a second and my eyes would cross.
[69:35.17]And then I'd blink a couple of times and go, sorry, what was the question?
[69:40.29]And even if I got fucking booed off the stage, it wouldn't even matter, because then they would know.
[69:44.59]Like, holy shit, our education system sucks.
[69:49.43]This guy's... Get this guy out of here.
[69:54.52]Or I'd get a standing ovation.
[69:58.38]What a gaffe.
[70:01.88]Legit, I have never wrote a check.
[70:05.47]Yeah, we have like... Think of it like our sex education, right?
[70:11.59]Even something like... Just... Just let us know some stuff.
[70:14.63]You know what I mean?
[70:15.13]Like... Let us know just some stuff.
[70:24.78]Every... Okay.
[70:26.00]There was health class.
[70:28.00]And health class did this thing.
[70:30.46]Where... I know a lot of you guys probably had a similar experience.
[70:33.72]And correct me if I'm wrong.
[70:35.59]Health class... Was typically... Some old lady...
[70:40.63]That when we got to the point where we were gonna do sex education, it was like, oh my god, LOL, look at the lady, the old lady say the word penis, isn't that so funny?
[70:51.79]We weren't learning anything!
[70:52.87]Okay, today, kids, what I would like to do is, you open up to page 20c, there's a penis, and everyone would be like, oh my god, she said it!
[71:09.88]We gotta rethink how we're teaching our children.
[71:12.76]Otherwise you end up like me!
[71:21.64]That's your fault.
[71:29.32]Oh no, anything but that.
[71:35.05]I would love just a simple... I don't know why they don't do this.
[71:39.65]Yeah, sure, we're going off right now.
[71:40.79]And I'm going off.
[71:41.47]I'm telling you, I'm hot tonight.
[71:44.43]Why don't we just have a simple life skills class?
[71:51.00]Why can't we just do that?
[71:52.72]Why can't we just do a life skills class?
[71:57.96]This is gonna sound crazy.
[72:00.80]But, I don't know if I'm going to get a lot of shit for this.
[72:02.64]People are going to make fun of me.
[72:04.16]I know you are.
[72:05.76]But, uh, is this even a life skill?
[72:07.84]I didn't know how to tie my shoes correctly until I was like 15.
[72:10.40]Is that a life skill?
[72:12.89]It might be a life skill.
[72:14.03]I didn't really get it.
[72:15.01]I just kind of mushed it up and... And like, did it wrong every time.
[72:24.46]Imagine if they just taught us how to tie our shoes.
[72:26.72]Do they?
[72:27.16]They do.
[72:27.94]Yeah, they do.
[72:28.34]When you're like 4.
[72:30.50]But they should be repeating that information into like our early teens and early 20s.
[72:34.11]Fuck, okay, let's go.
[72:41.29]No, but all jokes aside, all fucking around.
[72:45.21]We gotta be told about like our tax system, life skills, writing checks, credit.
[72:52.20]How many of you guys in this chat right now even know still what fucking credit even does?
[73:00.83]It took me until I was like fucking 28!
[73:16.20]He's right, Manga S. Thank you.
[73:24.43]Jerma, your sex edit understanding is on par with Goku.
[73:31.04]I don't- I don't understand that reference.
[73:40.03]What are you- uh, okay, now I do- wait, hold on a minute here, hold on.
[73:44.05]I- do you guys still think that at 34 I still- I don't know what, like, sex is?
[73:54.42]Am I- do I just not know this?
[74:00.94]I still don't know what it is?
[74:07.54]What the fuck?
[74:15.07]Somebody still has to teach me.
[74:23.00]No, but seriously.
[74:24.80]I've said this before.
[74:28.12]But.
[74:29.79]I think we've got to reimagine how we're teaching our children and bringing up our students.
[74:35.31]They've got to be ready.
[74:39.15]They've got to be ready.
[74:41.40]And we're teaching them stuff that we're not preparing them.
[74:50.38]Just play Nancy Drew.
[74:51.82]Mr. Comcast, no.
[74:54.08]This is important stuff.
[75:08.94]Do I still know what this does?
[75:11.34]Your time is up, Mr. Elbertson.
[75:19.78]That was just me talking the whole time as the senator?
[75:25.46]Mr. Elbertson, you spoke 12 minutes over what you were supposed to.
[75:31.77]And can you please stop doing the I'm crossing my eyes to make a point joke?
[75:38.55]Sorry, sorry.
[75:39.18]Yeah, go on.
[75:45.98]My fucking eyes hurt.
[75:46.90]A filibuster.
[75:47.22]They don't teach taxes.
[75:51.38]No, they don't.
[76:00.24]No, you're just expected to just... Hey, you know, like the 700 pages of tax code?
[76:07.19]You know that, right?
[76:09.13]No.
[76:10.25]Oh, idiot.
[76:21.51]Get good.
[76:23.77]No, you cannot treat something as important as tax code as playing Dark Souls.
[76:32.66]You have to actually go to wiki pages and government websites to find out certain things.
[76:37.76]It really is playing Dark Souls.
[76:40.32]Taxes is just Dark Souls on paper.
[76:51.33]Can I take that deduction?
[76:53.03]I don't know.
[76:53.63]Can you?
[76:56.17]I don't know.
[76:57.55]Look it up on the wiki.
[76:59.94]Oh, okay.
[77:00.91]I guess I'll look it up on the wiki for every question I have.
[77:03.83]Like, yeah.
[77:06.61]Wait, you don't know that?
[77:07.53]Why do you not know that?
[77:09.71]Uh, I don't know.
[77:10.89]I've never done that before.
[77:11.89]Holy shit, dude.
[77:15.31]I did it in less than two hours.
[77:18.30]Okay.
[77:24.14]Can I help?
[77:27.20]Why is everyone in your world an asshole?
[77:32.70]Is it true that the town's in financial trouble?
[77:37.41]Nobody's nice in this, like, universe apparently.
[77:40.99]Everybody's horrible.
[77:43.09]No spas, no ski resorts.
[77:45.33]We're a little, uh...
[77:47.07]baron Elizabeth bless her oh oh oh fuck what the hell man come on but it's just not in her oh I hurt myself what the hell how did this happen what is this and why do I have it in my hand I gave away the ship rights yes why am I playing with this back in the black of course did oh I just I just went like this and pinched myself really hard of course not
[78:17.32]Where did I get that?
[78:19.93]I don't know where I got that.
[78:20.87]I don't know where that's from.
[78:22.15]It just was here apparently.
[78:23.25]What the fuck?
[78:25.17]That actually hurts.
[78:28.61]Why was your glove found up near the volcanic caves?
[78:32.34]My glove?
[78:34.68]certain it was yours aha my glove I lost it when I was trying to carry a bit of wood down from the hills I was rather focused I can get a bit addle-brained I found the most interesting carving you see in part of an old tree near the caves it may even be from the 14th century or even earlier
[78:58.20]Where's the carving you brought back?
[79:00.02]Oh, it needs to be treated before it can be exposed to the air again.
[79:03.51]Oh, okay.
[79:03.89]If you'd like, I can show you later on.
[79:07.05]Uh, sure.
[79:07.61]Have you always lived here?
[79:09.19]For 12 years.
[79:10.43]In total.
[79:11.83]Two before University 10 after.
[79:14.73]Others seem to think of you as an outsider.
[79:17.56]Gunner especially.
[79:19.66]Oh, for the love of... I was born 10 miles away.
[79:24.85]And that means you don't live here?
[79:26.85]To him, yes.
[79:28.60]To everyone, yes.
[79:29.52]It's preposterous.
[79:30.90]In their minds, I'll never be from Skidbrook because I wasn't born here.
[79:34.80]You know what I mean?
[79:36.75]Upper secondary school was a nightmare with these people.
[79:40.10]Bye-bye.
[80:00.92]Well, on with it.
[80:02.92]Bye.
[80:04.74]Spill your guts to me.
[80:06.70]Bye.
[80:09.00]Alright, I still have to find Dagny.
[80:10.62]Still have to do that.
[80:12.09]Alright.
[80:13.93]I got that shit.
[80:15.13]Now I have to do... What the hell do I do now?
[80:26.79]Oh, right.
[80:27.23]Wait, the bricks.
[80:27.91]Remember the brick walls?
[80:31.26]posture check it should be okay um where uh where was that there was that room remember I was looking at the wall oh there's something behind that wall I think it's back here right
[80:58.82]Yeah, it's down here.
[80:59.54]And then there's a back wall over there.
[81:03.12]Where is this wall?
[81:05.85]There's the brick.
[81:10.45]Yeah, no, there's like a wall somewhere.
[81:12.21]Right here.
[81:12.71]See?
[81:12.87]I told you.
[81:13.81]What's with this wall?
[81:14.97]Shine a flashlight at the wall?
[81:32.59]Use the hook.
[81:35.87]Ooh.
[81:39.39]What just happened?
[81:50.31]Hook that shit.
[81:51.17]I'm trying.
[81:56.87]I heard it.
[81:59.51]It was like a...
[82:02.59]Wait.
[82:02.87]I heard something else.
[82:08.40]Ooh.
[82:08.56]Try the gear.
[82:26.45]No.
[82:26.85]Crank?
[82:28.01]No.
[82:28.25]What about the note?
[82:34.88]What's this picture for, then?
[82:37.02]Where's her phone?
[82:40.28]I don't think I can do anything with this yet.
[82:43.91]No, I can't do anything with this.
[82:48.61]Shit.
[82:53.01]Can I go back down here?
[82:59.92]Alright, um... I don't know.
[83:18.67]What the f- What is this for?
[83:19.89]This is for something too, I just don't know what.
[83:27.29]Dermadarling, be careful.
[83:28.65]I'm trying.
[83:35.49]He doesn't know.
[83:36.63]No, I don't know.
[83:37.29]I'm gonna go try to figure out this puzzle.
[83:42.18]Or open up the walkthrough and just... And lie to you guys and pretend like I'm playing the game.
[83:47.78]Which one do you think I should do?
[83:48.52]You know what I mean?
[83:55.54]I wonder if I should be like... Let's see.
[83:57.41]What was that?
[83:58.13]One... Three... No, that's not right.
[84:00.57]One, two... And then eventually get it even though I'm looking at the paper over here on the right.
[84:04.35]Um...
[84:08.07]Hmm.
[84:19.77]1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 6, and then what was the last one?
[84:24.21]I think it was 3, 5.
[84:25.81]Oh, no, that makes sense.
[84:26.55]Those noises are mechanical.
[84:29.28]Something within the ship must have unlocked elsewhere.
[84:37.19]He's bad at the game.
[84:38.37]No, I'm not.
[84:42.21]Nothing unlocked on the ship.
[84:49.97]What did it unlock?
[84:58.76]Oh, the wall.
[84:59.42]The wall.
[84:59.74]The wall.
[85:02.56]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[85:10.94]Let's see.
[85:13.62]Ah!
[85:14.70]There we go.
[85:15.62]Alright, secret.
[85:16.38]Let's get in here.
[85:17.78]Ooh, what's this?
[85:20.66]Another math problem.
[85:25.04]Light up all the numbers by pressing the correct sections.
[85:31.55]Is this like a dartboard?
[85:44.00]Oh, you can only do it a certain amount of times.
[85:46.74]Alright, we're set.
[85:47.26]How do I get these ones?
[85:55.57]Oh, shit.
[85:59.19]Okay.
[85:59.81]There we go.
[86:06.52]Got it.
[86:10.52]Why did that make like a, you open the door sound?
[86:15.58]That made like a .
[86:22.95]Oh, it's just that the boat is making all kinds of weird noise.
[86:25.37]Alright, hold on.
[86:32.38]Here we go.
[86:49.20]Someone DM me the history and origin behind jermaWalk.
[86:53.16]Um... It's just the way that I walk, man.
[86:56.61]Alright, ahhh!
[87:04.03]This is so easy, a child could do it.
[87:13.65]Okay, that's fine.
[87:16.02]Is it so easy that a child could do it, like me?
[87:18.77]Here we go.
[87:21.27]It's a machine of sorts, but some pieces are missing.
[87:24.79]It's just an adjacent puzzle.
[87:29.03]There's more shit missing here?
[87:34.42]What the?
[87:35.34]What?
[87:36.14]How is this?
[87:37.34]I need two more gears?
[87:39.72]Nancy.
[87:40.24]Egg?
[87:51.56]At least I get to dump some of that shit in my inventory.
[87:53.38]Alright, so now I got that.
[88:00.04]That's all I can do here.
[88:00.82]Is there anything else in this room?
[88:03.18]Not another secret room?
[88:06.52]Just jam a hook in there.
[88:07.60]I mean, that would be, like, a decent idea.
[88:11.85]I think when she says, hmm, you're doing it wrong.
[88:14.10]Yeah.
[88:16.12]Yeah, I think so.
[88:17.90]You'd be right.
[88:22.85]I'm going to go back up.
[88:28.65]Did I do everything I can in here?
[88:29.85]I think so.
[88:35.76]What am I missing?
[88:40.56]Through crew, he requires aid.
[88:42.00]Yeah, what should I look at now?
[88:46.88]Although I would assume none of you... None of you guys will really know.
[88:54.64]You know, I don't think anybody is going to know.
[89:05.96]It's me.
[89:06.82]I got to figure this out on my own.
[89:07.88]You know what I mean?
[89:13.20]Because even if you guys tell me what to do, they're... Is this guy thrown out of the pub?
[89:16.52]Follow him?
[89:49.07]Where are you?
[89:51.43]Oh wait, I can touch his stuff.
[89:54.11]Elizabeth, I love you so much.
[89:55.11]I feel like it's been forever since college.
[89:56.95]I wish you were here with me in Paris.
[89:58.59]The food is amazing.
[89:59.49]The skyline is to die for.
[90:00.73]How's old Moody Magnus?
[90:02.55]Has he gotten that ship obsession thing under control?
[90:05.11]Sorry to hear about the demotion and all that financial trouble with Soren.
[90:09.02]The gag?
[90:11.36]The guy sounds like a real weirdo.
[90:16.19]I'm sure it's got nothing to do with you, and besides, you always said that you wanted to handle the people side of the festival.
[90:21.94]Uh, more.
[90:23.52]More.
[90:24.42]More of this.
[90:25.10]I don't need it.
[90:26.44]Uh, okay.
[90:32.74]I think I know where that goes.
[90:34.10]Anything else over here?
[90:34.78]I think that's it.
[90:38.38]Let's see.
[90:40.95]Check it with a lock and a cup, please.
[90:42.55]Can't check that off yet.
[90:43.73]Okay.
[91:07.91]Use the gear?
[91:08.51]Yeah, so I'm just going to go back to the... Well, hold on.
[91:13.22]What did Gunner do this time?
[91:14.28]What did Gunner do this time?
[91:15.80]I should get some more coffee.
[91:16.66]He runs his mouth, and I can no longer bear it.
[91:18.64]He should have been out of my place years ago.
[91:20.73]You know what I can't believe?
[91:22.93]I know something I can't believe.
[91:24.67]I am a fool.
[91:25.31]What the fuck?
[91:26.17]Gunner does care a lot.
[91:28.59]He just has an unconventional way of showing it.
[91:32.81]Do you know what he said?
[91:34.01]Why are there so many different kinds of dog food?
[91:36.67]Go to a pet store.
[91:37.35]Why is it like 700 different dog foods?
[91:41.45]Which one's the good one?
[91:42.13]Fuck.
[91:42.23]I just talked over all that and it was probably important.
[91:44.35]No, I buy.
[91:44.77]I buy.
[91:44.95]I did dog food elimination round.
[92:11.07]Okay?
[92:12.29]You don't know what that means.
[92:13.25]That means when you have a dog, and you go, I really want to take care of my dog.
[92:17.52]I want my dog to eat well.
[92:18.56]I want to make sure that I have... He's getting nutrition.
[92:22.72]So what you do is you go to... You type in, like, best dog food.
[92:28.50]And then you need to scroll through potentially like 30 different ad pages that just put... You know, well, this one's the best one because somebody told us it was and paid us.
[92:39.87]There's so many different ones.
[92:41.43]You eliminate all the ones that are junk food brands.
[92:46.31]And then you have to go to the good ones, right?
[92:48.43]This quotes these good ones.
[92:50.80]So after you eliminate the Doritos of dog food...
[92:56.53]Some of these dog food brands, guys, holy shit.
[93:00.67]It is just crushed up Doritos, water, and cornstarch is pretty much what your dog is eating.
[93:08.14]Grain-free, yeah, he eats blue buffalo.
[93:12.18]And it was like, the formulation was like grain-free, it's like meats and vegetables and shit.
[93:24.45]Blue buffalo is good.
[93:25.33]Yeah, and it's pretty well priced.
[93:30.01]I did some, you know, you look up all, you find the dog food you want to use, and you're like, alright, is this dog food any good?
[93:34.35]And you look at, like, testing and third-party independent studies.
[93:41.62]Blue buffalo is, I'm not going to say that out loud.
[93:45.04]That says blue buffalo is trash.
[93:46.60]Well, that's what I mean.
[93:47.74]It's, how are you supposed to know anything?
[93:53.84]Can somebody explain to me why we have toothpaste that 9 out of 10 de- de- de- de- de- dectists recommend Colgate for teeth.
[94:07.94]Why don't 9 out of 10 vets recommend the same brand of, uh, of dog food?
[94:14.18]I don't understand.
[94:14.82]Is there a reason?
[94:16.98]Look, there's like 5 million different toothpastes and they all agree, oh, this is the ADA, uh, brand.
[94:22.27]Yes, that's good.
[94:23.85]The ADA stamps are approval on that one.
[94:27.04]Why does every dentist argue what's a good dog food?
[94:32.48]Oh, Blue Buffalo isn't very good, let me tell you.
[94:34.20]You go to a vet down the street?
[94:35.88]Blue Buffalo is great.
[94:37.46]You go to another vet.
[94:38.60]I recommend the shit we sell at our vet that's wicked expensive.
[94:42.88]Okay.
[94:44.80]Then you go to like the vet in the alleyway and the guy's like, you know, you could just like give him a steak and cheese sub every day and he'll be fine.
[94:51.89]And you're like, I'm not going back to that guy.
[95:01.56]It's hard.
[95:09.65]And this other... Well, you dog really should be eating raw food.
[95:12.19]Just a raw diet.
[95:14.72]Should he, though?
[95:15.82]I...
[95:19.02]We have this refrigerated section with dog food.
[95:21.16]And the refrigerated section has a bunch of food that you need to keep in your fridge.
[95:24.44]You should be feeding that big salami stick that you've cut a slice off and put it in their bowl.
[95:30.03]It's a huge salami thing.
[95:32.03]Is that good?
[95:32.65]I don't know.
[95:35.39]My vet didn't tell me to do that.
[95:45.27]Yes.
[95:46.07]That's good.
[95:46.73]Actually, yes.
[95:53.39]Dogs can have a little salami.
[95:54.99]No, don't feed your dog salami.
[95:57.42]Do not feed your dog salami.
[96:01.28]Do not do that.
[96:12.38]Bernie says they can have a little.
[96:14.16]What are you talking about?
[96:15.42]Who's Bernie?
[96:16.16]Who's Bernie?
[96:16.86]Like...
[96:20.51]Bernie Dog Salami?
[96:22.59]Is Bernie a vet?
[96:23.45]Is this a react video, but there's no reaction?
[96:31.73]They're just talking about the thing that they're supposed to be watching?
[96:37.28]I don't understand.
[96:38.32]Dog Salami.
[96:52.47]Dog salami Bernie.
[96:57.91]Bernie Sanders.
[97:01.48]What's the deal with the cats can have- It's cats, not dogs.
[97:04.08]What's the deal with the cats can have a little salami meme?
[97:09.42]This is not even- Is it Imgur?
[97:13.48]Elizabeth of Bernie.
[97:14.88]Can cats have salami?
[97:16.16]Cats can have a little salami.
[97:17.54]Cats should only eat cat food.
[97:23.19]I thought it was a video.
[97:29.80]So this is what it is.
[97:31.10]Okay.
[97:35.53]I mean, I don't know.
[97:36.49]I wouldn't feed any dogs or cats salami.
[97:40.61]I mean, like, you could maybe a little bit of banana.
[97:42.53]That's okay.
[97:43.61]Just eat a banana.
[97:48.23]Where's this image that I just set?
[97:49.31]Why am I doing this right now?
[97:50.43]No, no, no, no.
[97:51.17]Somebody fucked me up.
[97:52.49]They said, go on a rant.
[97:54.01]Go on a funny rant.
[97:54.95]And I was like, okay.
[97:56.81]What happened?
[97:57.45]Where are we?
[97:57.81]I don't even care about this image.
[97:59.67]Let's play.
[98:05.15]What was I doing?
[98:06.03]Get this off my screen.
[98:09.87]Okay.
[98:13.45]Quick, do something funny.
[98:15.61]That wasn't even funny.
[98:16.69]They're not supposed to be funny.
[98:18.19]They're supposed to be real life.
[98:19.67]Alright, I'm just walking in circles.
[98:24.13]What am I doing?
[98:24.61]Okay.
[98:25.35]I have to find... Bananas have potassium.
[98:33.17]They're radioactive.
[98:34.08]Get out of here.
[98:42.66]It's a fucking banana.
[98:44.10]You're gonna be fine Alright, what what the what was I just doing can't check still still have to do that Potassium explodes in water, you know, you need potassium, right potassium Let me know What are you talking about
[99:13.00]Potassium is not bad for you.
[99:15.02]Potassium is radioactive.
[99:18.23]What?
[99:18.81]Where are you guys getting this?
[99:20.45]Who cares?
[99:21.83]It's probably like 0.2% microns or something for radioactive level.
[99:29.55]My bathtub is probably more radioactive than 500 bananas.
[99:32.50]Who cares?
[99:44.09]Alright.
[99:45.49]Alright.
[99:45.83]Alright.
[99:46.15]Alright.
[99:46.49]Oh, no, no, no.
[99:47.17]The disk.
[99:47.47]The metal disk.
[99:47.95]Okay, let's go.
[99:54.30]I'm so excitable today.
[99:56.50]You got me in one of those moods where I'm excitable.
[100:01.58]Who did that?
[100:04.95]It's a secret room.
[100:06.13]Okay, this way.
[100:12.14]Alright, let's put it on.
[100:12.82]There's one more.
[100:19.07]Only one more left.
[100:23.51]And who knows where the hell that is.
[100:28.95]Let's go back into the town.
[100:32.12]Imagine you could run this fast.
[100:36.88]Holy shit, Nancy.
[100:40.70]Nancy is sprinting around this town.
[100:44.56]You know what actually a nice touch would be, would you put this whole game in full letter grade?
[100:49.21]Is if you click really fast like this, she's like... Let's go back to the pub.
[101:06.46]Oh, there he is.
[101:08.40]What happened with Elizabeth?
[101:09.12]Holy shit.
[101:33.56]Every video game character never changes their clothes.
[101:36.98]If you're like an NPC in a video game, you have the same clothes every time.
[101:40.75]For every game.
[101:46.68]What the fuck?
[101:51.66]Maybe you should try to make up?
[101:54.13]No need for that woman.
[101:55.59]No need for anyone anymore.
[101:57.59]That blasted woman won't let me get into the skip again.
[102:01.12]His clothes are probably more radioactive than your bathtub.
[102:04.16]A personal box.
[102:05.26]I did not get a chance to grab it before.
[102:07.72]Guys, go walk down into your basement if you have one and take one breath in.
[102:12.78]You just consumed probably 5,000 bananas worth of radioactive material.
[102:23.98]If you help, I'll give you the only clue I have.
[102:25.90]Alright, I'll get the box.
[102:27.02]I'll get the box.
[102:28.08]But I swear, if you're lying to me... I'm being honest as the day is short.
[102:33.25]Nancy, please.
[102:35.05]Talk to you later.
[102:35.77]Bless.
[102:37.71]Okay.
[102:45.30]What does he want?
[102:48.28]This thing.
[102:49.56]Oh, it's unlocked already.
[102:54.97]Let's open it.
[102:55.51]Is that a picture of me?
[103:03.32]Did he just make me go get a box of pictures of me and shit?
[103:14.82]What does it say?
[103:16.52]Police close drowning case of two women... Oh, shit.
[103:19.58]Alright, hold on.
[103:21.66]Alright.
[103:30.13]Is that here?
[103:31.55]You can have this.
[103:32.91]Did he not know what this was?
[103:39.24]Here.
[103:39.62]I think this belongs to you.
[103:44.14]Thank you.
[103:44.54]Did you open it?
[103:54.87]Yes.
[103:56.56]I see.
[103:57.38]You didn't tell me not to open it.
[103:58.36]I am ashamed of the way I acted towards Alyssa.
[104:00.70]Super Bruce.
[104:01.00]Five community subs from Super Bruce.
[104:02.16]Thank you, Bruce.
[104:02.54]I have been angry and blind for too long.
[104:04.94]My daughter wouldn't stand for me like this.
[104:07.32]No more of that childishness now.
[104:10.10]Every day I wake up and for one moment I think they're still alive.
[104:16.16]Holy shit.
[104:29.07]It was a long time ago.
[104:31.21]I can see now there are still things left to live for.
[104:35.21]Strong ships, good festivals, new neighbors.
[104:40.07]But did he throw bottles at that guy at the cultural center?
[104:43.25]Come see me at the Misty Skip after the tides change.
[104:47.04]I'll give you everything I have.
[104:52.58]Alright, so let's go to bed.
[105:05.47]Oh, there we go.
[105:05.97]Hold on, I'm texting somebody.
[105:26.51]I know, I know.
[105:26.97]Put your phone down.
[105:27.65]Put your phone down.
[105:28.49]I know, I know, I know.
[105:30.73]Hold on.
[105:31.17]I know, I know.
[105:32.05]I got my phone up during the movie.
[105:33.21]I'm sorry.
[105:36.33]Fucking zoomer.
[105:37.27]No, I'm sorry.
[105:37.99]I apologize.
[105:38.69]Alright, where are you setting this up?
[105:43.89]A gear?
[105:44.25]Let me do the puzzle piece first.
[105:56.45]I typically don't use my phone for anything.
[106:01.93]You can ask the people that call me all the time when I don't answer.
[106:09.21]Phones to me are like a pain in the ass.
[106:13.65]See, back in the day, everybody knew that you were not in constant communication.
[106:21.12]Now everybody has a cell phone in their pocket.
[106:23.18]So I know, I know you're there.
[106:25.82]I know that you're getting this, right?
[106:28.62]So the 500 IQ play is just leave your phone in your bedroom, just on your bed.
[106:35.90]So then it's just like it was 15 years ago.
[106:41.92]Now you're always constantly contactable.
[106:43.86]And what if you just don't want to be contactable?
[106:45.60]But people know you have your phone because everybody has a phone.
[106:51.98]And then they added the shit that they have the read receipts thing.
[106:55.82]That's fucked up too.
[106:58.50]What if I'm like out at the grocery store and somebody texts me and I have read receipts on and I look at it.
[107:02.88]Oh no, I have to reply to this person right now.
[107:07.41]What if I'm like trying to pick my favorite hamburger helper and it's taking me 30 minutes.
[107:20.21]No, we gotta go back to the cabin.
[107:29.03]That's a then problem?
[107:32.31]Look, I understand, like, I understand, like, the cell phones are amazing because they've given us a way for emergency contacts and always being in communication and if something, you know, if you're lost, you know, I've got my phone, I have access to, I have access to the outside world.
[107:54.17]All of your stories devolve into anxious paranoia.
[107:59.86]Well, they don't.
[108:01.91]This is the same picture.
[108:16.69]That's it.
[108:17.03]I think this is it.
[108:19.13]Oh yeah, that's it.
[108:19.75]Done.
[108:20.81]I've seen this design before.
[108:24.10]It's from the lighthouse.
[108:25.56]There must be something there.
[108:29.00]Alright, we gotta go to the lighthouse and find the star.
[108:32.68]Go to the lighthouse.
[108:33.78]I thought that was somebody crawling.
[108:35.70]Okay.
[109:06.44]Let's go to the lighthouse.
[109:10.12]She's the 5G killer?
[109:16.15]Don't give me another thing to have nightmares over tonight.
[109:33.78]He's actually scared of 5G.
[109:37.70]It's so new.
[109:38.82]The technology is so new.
[109:40.54]It's so scary sometimes.
[109:41.92]Oh, there she is.
[109:44.66]Guys, it took 50 years for doctors to stop recommending smoking cigarettes.
[109:59.63]We've only had wireless technology and cell phone technology for like fucking less than 10 to 15 years.
[110:09.59]Just saying.
[110:11.45]You should stop doing that.
[110:12.43]People like me don't deserve that.
[110:14.03]Anyways, you, me, town.
[110:18.63]So, you faked that you'd gone missing, huh?
[110:21.75]Yeah, yeah, don't look at me with those kicked puppy eyes.
[110:24.72]I needed some time to crack the case without anyone catching on to me.
[110:28.95]Alright, we've got to pay attention.
[110:30.83]You faked that you'd gone missing.
[110:31.95]Yeah, yeah, don't look at me with those puppy eyes.
[110:34.43]I needed to crack the case.
[110:35.72]That's my job.
[110:36.34]You must have a compelling lead on the treasure.
[110:38.46]Otherwise, knowing you, you'd never have left the heater.
[110:41.92]Pretty passive-aggressive.
[110:43.00]Let's pick that one.
[110:44.00]You must have a compelling lead on the treasure.
[110:46.64]Otherwise, knowing you, you'd never have left the heater.
[110:49.36]Uh, detectives.
[110:52.53]Okay, fine.
[110:54.45]The ship itself is a map to the treasure.
[110:56.99]I suspected that.
[110:58.61]The problem is the original ship was torn apart.
[111:01.17]Many of the pieces of the original have been built into the tower.
[111:04.26]I've been putting them together, but something's still missing.
[111:07.12]I need some sort of key, something to help me decode the map.
[111:10.56]So, let me guess.
[111:12.24]You know where to find that key.
[111:14.90]Not even.
[111:15.46]But you know what?
[111:17.71]I think you do.
[111:18.83]I said eat banana.
[111:21.01]And a bunch of people in this chat was so concerned about the radiation in a banana.
[111:25.92]But 5G, I would like stand in front of a 5G frequency wave.
[111:38.20]Dude, 5G is just, it's like nothing.
[111:40.00]Don't worry.
[111:40.52]Don't eat bananas though.
[111:41.44]There's like 0.000001% fucking radiation in that soil that it was in.
[111:43.36]Sorry, I don't.
[111:43.70]Hmm.
[111:43.82]A girl with principles.
[111:44.52]That's cute.
[111:55.24]5G is one one thousandth of a banana.
[112:15.60]If you eat a banana near a 5G tower, you're going to die.
[112:21.65]I'm not a greedy grinner.
[112:41.55]By the way, Greedy Grinner is one of the nominees, along with Shito, Clowns, and Shannon Sharon.
[112:51.48]And the rumor for best character, new character of the year, by the way, if you haven't voted yet, there is a way to vote for your favorites of the year.
[112:59.83]New Year's Eve stream, the poll is now live.
[113:03.81]There it is.
[113:06.78]Take a look.
[113:10.44]Maybe that'll help you.
[113:11.69]If you decide to stop hating money, I'll be waiting.
[113:15.11]Toodles.
[113:18.13]Alright.
[113:19.09]So I have this lion token.
[113:20.68]What's that for, though?
[113:21.88]That's done.
[113:23.50]Can't check that off yet.
[113:25.44]Follow up on the... Okay, I gotta go back to the tower.
[113:34.98]Now, I'm not giving my opinion on any of the nominees.
[113:37.66]I don't want to sway anything.
[113:39.66]Positive or negative.
[113:52.22]Nope.
[113:54.44]Not happening.
[113:55.64]I think it's time to find out what Elizabeth's hiding in that deck closet.
[113:59.18]Didn't I already go in this closet?
[114:03.38]I have nothing for you.
[114:05.11]I already went in here.
[114:12.30]Nancy, stop.
[114:13.24]Don't go in there.
[114:14.26]Sorry, Elizabeth, but it's time to come clean.
[114:17.01]I know you're hiding someone in there.
[114:19.31]No, you can't.
[114:36.93]Why did you put a dog in there?
[114:40.85]So much for finding Magnus, I guess.
[114:43.49]You thought I was hiding Magnus?
[114:46.91]You have to admit, it was really suspicious.
[114:50.65]Sorry I pinned you wrong, though.
[114:53.09]So he would do better in a 3x3 closet.
[115:08.83]I want to hate him so much.
[115:10.83]But I just can't.
[115:12.79]When did you manage to get Toomey?
[115:14.82]Just before Magnus left to take the ship into harbor.
[115:17.98]That's why I wasn't at the festival.
[115:19.76]Hang on.
[115:20.50]So you knew Magnus was going to go missing?
[115:23.10]No.
[115:23.68]But I knew he'd notice if Toomey did.
[115:25.87]And then maybe he'd have to come looking for me for once.
[115:30.98]Elizabeth, pet-napping may not be a healthy way to handle this.
[115:37.36]I agree.
[115:37.82]It started off as that, but now that he's missing, I feel like it's smarter to keep Toomey here.
[115:44.22]If someone did abduct Magnus, how long would Toomey spend in a cage at the barters?
[115:49.47]Listen Nancy just a little while ago.
[115:52.37]I realized something when you told me my family Because it is a love song it's a love song for my family's heritage the treasure I
[116:04.18]So the purpose of the song was to make sure only Captain Lawrence's descendant could find that treasure.
[116:10.41]Here, have this.
[116:13.03]I've never shown these to anyone.
[116:14.23]Ooh, music box.
[116:15.37]Maybe they've been the key all along.
[116:17.15]I trust you to find out the truth, Nancy.
[116:19.31]Okay, cool.
[116:21.37]Bring Magnus home.
[116:23.21]Bring Magnus home.
[116:24.39]Alright, goodbye, Elizabeth.
[116:27.33]I'll see you when you return home to whatever fucking Sims expansion you came from.
[116:33.83]Back to the cabin talk to the dog I Can't you can't talk to the dog.
[116:44.28]No dog can't talk to dog I Gotta go I gotta go to the yeah the cabin
[117:03.93]Music box.
[117:04.17]Here we go.
[117:04.41]Alright.
[117:04.63]Stick it in there.
[117:06.53]Oh, fuck.
[117:07.37]Arrange the... I don't know.
[117:08.20]I don't know what this means.
[117:11.92]I don't like music.
[117:12.50]I'm gonna say... I was gonna go for it.
[117:13.78]Let's... What is...
[117:45.24]uh let's try um uh and then two in a row so it's like that no is it gonna be the same size are they all they are none of these the same size
[118:12.60]They're all different sizes.
[118:19.01]Damn it.
[118:20.37]I can't read... Of course I can't read music.
[118:26.79]In order of height.
[118:27.51]Yeah, but aren't those two notes on the same line?
[118:31.09]So wouldn't it be the same size?
[118:38.30]Or am I overthinking this?
[118:53.28]You're UNDER-thinking it.
[118:56.82]Yeah, it goes... LOOOOOOOW.
[119:01.74]So... Just do shortest to longest.
[119:12.01]I-I-I don't think that- I don't think that's accurate.
[119:16.09]It's not shortest to longest.
[119:20.21]Is it?
[119:31.37]I thought it would have to be... It's still going.
[119:44.62]Sorting algorithm.
[119:46.86]I don't think that was correct.
[119:49.70]Lion.
[119:58.23]The notes change.
[119:58.97]Yeah, why did the notes change?
[120:07.94]Watch the dots?
[120:08.94]The game lagged for a second.
[120:39.51]He's scrolling down in the walkthrough.
[120:47.19]No, I'm not.
[120:48.55]I'm not.
[120:49.51]Fuck you.
[121:01.69]Yes, you are.
[121:02.43]Hey, easy.
[121:04.50]Don't swear at me.
[121:13.02]Harry Potter?
[121:14.56]Can I actually get it to do that?
[121:40.70]Dun dun.
[121:41.12]This needs to be higher.
[121:43.28]Try this one.
[121:49.14]Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[121:53.88]Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[121:59.02]Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[122:03.38]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[122:05.65]This needs to be lower.
[122:16.17]I almost had it.
[122:20.61]Sorry.
[122:21.01]Alright, let's see.
[122:21.52]What do I want to move?
[122:22.86]I want to move... It's got to start like this.
[122:25.90]Big one's got to be in the middle.
[122:27.06]I know that for a fact.
[122:28.08]I just do.
[122:29.02]How do I know that, you ask?
[122:31.25]I took two music classes.
[122:32.61]This is the crescendo.
[122:33.97]That's what that's called.
[122:57.12]Let's try that.
[123:08.71]Just try every combination.
[123:10.91]Longer bars make lower notes, yep.
[123:19.42]This is just what happens when somebody tries to phonetically play Jingle Bells on a piano.
[123:25.48]Even if you get it wrong, you're getting the timings right.
[123:28.56]Um... Hmm...
[123:58.28]Okay, try that.
[124:14.60]Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[125:06.74]Somebody said, how are you this bad?
[125:10.56]I just did it.
[125:13.98]Tone deaf.
[125:14.78]Oh my god, he's so stupid.
[125:16.90]I'll take my fish, please.
[125:18.40]I like this one.
[125:19.20]Let me look at this one a little bit more.
[125:20.84]Alright, nice.
[125:28.43]My eyes are ripping open to chat.
[125:31.19]Cool.
[125:31.53]What is that?
[125:32.53]Cool.
[125:33.09]What's that image?
[125:33.79]Nice.
[125:34.41]Nice.
[125:37.03]Alright, I gotta stop looking.
[125:37.93]Let's get back to the game.
[125:38.67]What's this?
[125:41.23]Oh, that's like a little fish.
[125:42.17]It's like a little gummy fish.
[125:43.82]That's so cool.
[125:44.40]I just want to look at it for a minute.
[125:49.80]Cool.
[125:52.68]Alright, what is this?
[125:57.22]Part of a note or a book.
[125:58.54]We succeeded.
[125:59.16]We fought.
[125:59.66]We captured the Hir Lifkahid.
[126:02.28]Okay.
[126:03.54]Alright.
[126:04.49]So now I got the fish.
[126:07.93]Track down the treasure's location.
[126:10.43]Okay.
[126:11.79]There's that.
[126:12.45]Alright.
[126:15.41]I want fish gummy.
[126:17.48]I want fish gummy.
[126:18.56]I want fish gummy.
[126:19.62]You'll relax.
[126:21.16]You'll find.
[126:23.18]Relax.
[126:23.44]Relax.
[126:26.21]Cheating like this is why Jerma died to pinwheel.
[126:32.66]What is going on?
[126:38.48]Change OBS to all screens to prove no guide.
[126:51.38]You know how easy it would be for me just to close the tab that has the walkthrough in it?
[126:54.94]Very easy.
[126:55.66]Oh shit, you got me.
[126:56.52]Oh no.
[126:56.88]Alright, let's go.
[126:58.24]What's this fish?
[126:59.30]Wooden tile.
[126:59.78]Lion token.
[127:24.70]Let's go back to the, uh... I want to go back to that wall.
[127:33.77]Can you order me Uber Eats?
[127:38.42]How about you tell me what you want, and I will order Uber Eats.
[127:42.64]And then I'll just eat the food that you were going to eat.
[127:45.00]And I'll eat it on stream for you.
[127:46.66]And then you can just take the bites, like, mimic while I'm biting, and be like, Mmm!
[127:54.98]Alright, um... Where was that... thing?
[128:02.74]Oh right, I gotta go back to the ship.
[128:07.17]Uh oh, ship alarm.
[128:13.85]Why is there a screw in the... is this a camera?
[128:17.73]Why is there a... What?
[128:25.26]Okay, the clues Lawrence left behind have confirmed that the treasure is not on the ship.
[128:31.82]He evidently suspected that the town would eventually turn against him and decided to hide the treasure elsewhere at this place.
[128:38.60]I've been able to recreate the first steps and clearly the caves run deeper than we realized.
[128:43.58]There must be more pages from Lawrence's journal that will reveal the final steps to take.
[128:48.14]Enter the caves.
[128:49.40]Oh.
[128:50.86]Turn right at the red pumice stones.
[128:53.36]Walk forward to- Alright.
[128:56.30]What else is in here?
[128:57.00]That's it?
[128:57.32]He's up there.
[129:06.41]Got ya.
[129:13.95]Uh.
[129:17.57]What?
[129:22.72]It's the dog.
[129:23.56]No, we're not.
[129:27.60]We're not gonna get... I can't... Is that a spoiler?
[129:31.49]No, I'm not gonna say spoilers.
[129:32.85]Okay, well, now I know... So, I tracked down the treasure.
[129:45.99]So, we have to go to the cave.
[129:48.58]I gotta read this.
[129:49.76]Red stones...
[129:55.03]This would be a cool little adventure.
[129:57.61]Alright.
[129:58.25]Oh, that's wrong.
[130:00.40]I don't want Lawrence's journal.
[130:01.46]I don't care about Lawrence's journal.
[130:04.04]Get out of here.
[130:05.90]I want the location.
[130:08.52]End of the caves.
[130:09.60]Turn right at the red pumice stone.
[130:12.22]There it is.
[130:13.39]Right.
[130:16.29]Walk forward to the high ledge with red stone.
[130:27.10]Okay.
[130:29.54]Climbing up and over, then down past the yellow pumice stones.
[130:35.21]Okay.
[130:40.07]Continue forward till the tunnel splits levels go up.
[130:56.83]Okay.
[131:00.77]Turn right at the cluster of five stalagmites and continue forward to a large cavern.
[131:18.60]Okay.
[131:24.41]Wait, didn't I already get this?
[131:26.03]Is it the egg?
[131:35.11]I already did this.
[131:38.84]Turn right.
[131:55.31]Go up.
[131:57.17]Go up.
[131:59.68]Stalagmites are the ones that hang.
[132:00.88]Five stalagmites.
[132:02.34]They hang.
[132:03.96]Turn right at the cluster of five stalagmites.
[132:07.51]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[132:09.69]Eight.
[132:11.03]No, stalagmites are off.
[132:12.15]One, two, three, four.
[132:13.01]Okay, just turn right.
[132:13.87]That's what I just did.
[132:18.11]And continue forward to a large cavern.
[132:24.29]I can't go forward.
[132:27.55]There it is.
[132:42.44]I already picked up the shit that was down here, didn't I?
[132:52.26]Ice pick?
[132:52.70]No, that's not doing anything.
[132:58.46]Is it the egg?
[133:05.96]Okay, I'm going to the guide.
[133:19.12]What's the guide say?
[133:28.19]Okay.
[133:29.31]Track down the treasure.
[133:32.41]Yeah.
[133:34.35]Head into the right tunnel.
[133:36.85]Continue two steps.
[133:38.29]Use the hook on the wall.
[133:41.84]Isn't that what I did?
[133:53.02]That's what I'm doing.
[133:54.96]Wrong wall?
[134:12.12]Okay, I'm in the cavern.
[134:13.14]Go back.
[134:30.91]Wrong hook?
[134:34.44]What's the right hook?
[134:36.44]What?
[134:37.42]What do you mean, wrong hook?
[134:53.06]Give me back to square one.
[134:54.67]Give me back to square one.
[134:55.55]Back to square one.
[134:56.27]This doesn't do anything.
[134:59.43]Back to square one.
[135:01.84]Just give me back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[135:04.26]Put this away.
[135:11.40]Give me back up.
[135:12.26]Just back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[135:14.26]Alright, alright, alright.
[135:15.10]I've gone up.
[135:16.68]Turn around.
[135:18.42]Go up.
[135:19.22]Here we go.
[135:20.92]Alright, wait a minute.
[135:21.74]Okay, turn stalagmites.
[135:26.28]Stalagmites.
[135:28.72]Continue forward to a large cavern.
[135:32.14]Left and right, it separates.
[135:34.24]Head to the right tunnel.
[135:43.15]Go forward twice.
[135:45.77]Use the pick on the wall.
[135:48.84]Use the hook on the wall.
[135:55.33]I can't do this yet.
[135:56.39]That's the problem.
[135:57.25]I can't smash this wall because I haven't read the note about how I should smash the fucking wall.
[136:14.53]I'm not too- Get- I better have saved before that.
[136:23.13]That better have saved.
[136:26.94]Thank God.
[136:27.36]Alright, get me the fuck out of here.
[136:31.65]Get me out of here.
[136:32.25]Get me.
[136:32.49]I gotta go read, like, I gotta do something else and read a note.
[136:45.94]Alright, what do I have?
[136:47.22]I have some stuff.
[136:48.74]I have to go back to where?
[136:50.44]Where should I go?
[136:59.39]This is what happens when you cheat with the Dru crew.
[137:02.20]No, everything's fine.
[137:03.54]I know what I have to do.
[137:06.54]I know what I have to do.
[137:07.46]Check it out.
[137:11.38]Oh.
[137:24.08]Check this out.
[137:25.66]That's a lion token.
[137:26.54]It's a Plinko machine.
[137:27.76]Oh, this is actually kind of fun.
[137:29.14]Alright.
[137:29.48]Reset it.
[137:52.59]They're all flipped, so it goes down straight first.
[137:58.22]Does it bounce over here?
[137:59.12]No, it doesn't.
[138:01.84]So it goes and alternates.
[138:05.20]No, it doesn't.
[138:05.84]It goes down straight, doesn't it?
[138:07.18]I thought it did.
[138:11.05]What do we want?
[138:12.35]That's here right now.
[138:13.43]The Druker's right here.
[138:18.25]Alright, here we go.
[138:18.79]Alright, it's so damn close.
[138:21.03]I just have to go.
[138:22.98]Fuck.
[138:28.50]Shit.
[138:37.33]Come on.
[138:37.87]No.
[138:38.23]I'm excited.
[139:24.44]What was that?
[139:24.86]What was that?
[139:25.48]Hold on.
[139:25.78]What's it?
[139:26.08]What?
[139:26.32]I'm going to guide.
[139:27.22]I just did it.
[139:27.96]I fucked it up.
[139:28.48]I'm just going to guide.
[139:30.02]I had it right.
[139:33.52]Banana 5G brain.
[139:37.54]I literally just did it.
[139:38.50]Alright.
[139:38.90]What's the guide say?
[139:39.97]Who cares?
[139:40.33]I need to find... He wasted so many lion coins.
[139:51.54]No, I had it.
[139:52.14]Okay, at least then go down here.
[139:54.26]That's done.
[139:54.78]That's it.
[140:05.75]Didn't even need to cheat.
[140:08.05]I didn't even have to cheat on that one.
[140:11.44]Final gear.
[140:23.47]I gotta go back to... Alright, now I have all the gears.
[140:28.21]It's time.
[140:30.25]Wait, that's on a boat.
[140:40.58]It's in the secret room.
[140:44.16]Head down here.
[140:46.56]Open that up.
[140:48.54]Back to the secret room.
[140:50.86]Alright.
[140:51.64]Get it on there.
[140:52.90]Done.
[140:55.23]what is behind here.
[141:03.67]This is a pretty long game for a shitty dollar bin game.
[141:07.34]Yeah, I played it for like six hours last time too.
[141:09.28]What in the name of God is this?
[141:21.95]Move the sliding shape to the yellow treasure mark using your mouse or keyboard arrows.
[141:30.19]Uh... They did this shit in Zoombinis and it was horrible.
[141:40.10]So I have to be a red fish to go over there.
[141:45.86]Um... Okay, hold on.

[143:03.02]Like a red star is what I need to be.
[143:08.64]So how do I get to be red star?
[143:09.60]Oh, shit.

[144:00.07]Grease Lightning, thanks for the five community subs.
[144:02.11]Thank you, Grease Lightning.
[144:05.44]Five subs coming.
[144:09.26]Still have to do that.
[144:11.50]I bet I need to get one of every symbol on each row and column.
[144:16.75]Arrange the pieces so that every row and column has one of each design.
[144:25.40]What are you talking about?
[144:31.63]Um.
[144:55.21]But can I put them anywhere?
[144:57.41]I can... Wait, hold on.
[144:59.29]Why are these here, then?
[145:04.55]Why are these here?
[145:13.99]Arrange the pieces so that every row and column has one of each design.
[145:21.68]Um... But this...
[145:25.73]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[145:27.32]So you mean we're talking like... But there's two of these in here.
[145:32.48]There's two of these going down.
[145:34.93]This is impossible.
[145:35.59]I can't do that.
[145:36.35]There's two going down.
[145:39.25]I can cover them.
[145:40.43]Fuck.
[145:40.97]Alright, I can cover them.
[145:42.45]Fuck.
[145:58.56]Wrong?
[146:02.35]Wrong already?
[146:03.67]No?
[146:03.91]Okay.
[146:04.25]Alright.
[146:06.49]So... The boat is sinking.
[146:09.75]Everyone will be fine.
[146:11.29]Don't worry.
[146:11.69]There's nobody even on the boat, guys.
[146:22.76]But now... Oh, this is horrible.
[146:28.40]So I gotta go.
[146:29.14]Let's just do this.
[146:30.12]It can't be this one.
[146:32.48]I mean... This has to be there.
[146:35.29]Nothing else can cover that.
[146:37.91]Can anything else cover this?
[146:41.71]No.
[146:41.97]No, this is wrong.
[146:45.17]You have to have these.
[146:46.21]The circles are huge.
[146:47.28]You can't... Done.
[146:52.76]Okay.
[146:52.94]Okay.
[147:02.15]Square, square.
[147:06.73]I might need to flip this around.
[147:07.89]I might need to switch it.
[147:16.09]Turn the sound down.
[147:17.19]Oh, is the sound really loud?
[147:19.63]Shit, I'm sorry.
[147:20.19]Alright, so we're going to do... Wait, what?
[147:32.64]How could there be... How are there three of these?
[147:37.34]Uh, wait.
[147:38.46]I'm confused.
[147:39.12]How would there be three of these?
[147:41.92]Oh, it needs to be covered!
[147:42.81]Okay, um... What's this... What's this copypasta?
[147:59.98]There's a bunch of emotes and shit.
[148:04.60]Alright, get that out of here.
[148:06.34]Get that out of here.
[148:07.78]Alright, I can't even read it.
[148:08.70]Okay, now we need this one and then this one.
[148:16.93]Is that correct?
[148:18.23]We'll find out.
[148:19.23]That's not correct.
[148:21.20]This has to be... Wait, what's underneath that?
[148:23.32]Yes.
[148:26.22]Okay, what about down here?
[148:32.60]Empty?
[148:33.26]Alright.
[148:33.56]I get it.
[148:34.62]Oh, fuck.
[148:37.04]This is wrong.
[148:48.19]Uh... I don't know.
[149:00.04]It's going well.
[149:01.94]Kind of.
[149:03.77]Alright, that needs to be covered, so what if I go like this?
[149:08.69]And then here.
[149:10.49]And then... That noise really is fucking hurting me.
[149:16.23]What's the last one?
[149:19.66]Alright.
[149:22.62]So far it's working.
[149:24.36]Kind of.
[149:26.18]This puzzle is easy.
[149:27.18]Yeah, I know.
[149:29.24]Maybe for you.
[149:34.47]Let's just start putting shit in here, and we can fix it later.
[149:38.79]This is still correct?
[149:40.67]Correct?
[149:43.83]Why can't I put that here?
[149:48.67]Oh, no.
[149:49.13]I have to cover that.
[149:49.83]Uh-oh.
[149:54.90]Um... Ah...
[150:08.21]Okay.
[150:09.17]Oof.
[150:13.83]Life is pain.
[150:14.99]It kind of is at the moment.
[150:20.15]This has to be a... This has to be this.
[150:23.86]This has to be correct.
[150:25.00]So this is wrong.
[150:27.70]This is also wrong?
[150:29.46]Wait, that's wrong.
[150:40.88]Holy shit, this sucks.
[150:43.94]Uh... Mods, please slow mode or sub only or something.
[150:47.43]Please make it stop.
[150:57.23]I just like seeing purple in chat.
[150:58.70]Yeah, I still have to figure out what I'm gonna do with that stuff.
[151:01.94]Alright, everything's been covered.
[151:06.48]This is not right.
[151:11.33]Okay, I still need one of these.
[151:14.62]Is that done?
[151:15.38]No, what's wrong with this?
[151:21.34]Okay, wait.
[151:24.20]Now, hold on.
[151:26.89]That has to be covered there.
[151:27.79]What am I missing?
[151:33.09]This doesn't even have one of these.
[151:38.80]He hates us.
[151:39.62]What?
[151:39.84]What are you talking about?
[151:45.60]You still have 9,000 points?
[151:47.06]Well, I would save them, because... For, like, 50,000 points, you'll be able to, like, turn my camera on or something.
[151:53.52]Alright, what's this last one?
[151:57.32]It has to be this, right?
[151:59.18]Good.
[152:04.24]This is still correct.
[152:06.78]Alright.
[152:08.76]Hold on, it's almost ready.
[152:13.78]Here...
[152:18.45]Here?
[152:19.03]Ah, this is wrong.
[152:26.17]Um... It's so close though.
[152:44.84]Shit.
[152:46.96]What needs to change?
[152:48.16]This has too many of these?
[152:51.59]Oh!
[152:54.97]I didn't cheat, I swear to god I didn't cheat.
[152:56.47]I promise.
[153:04.64]Open the chest in the hold.
[153:09.54]Oh shit, there's like a skeleton back here.
[153:12.68]Alright, track down the treasure, follow up on the image created by the sketches.
[153:19.22]I have to go back to the lighthouse.
[153:20.20]Alright, who do you guys think did it?
[153:32.73]I can't wait till we find out who did it.
[153:34.11]It's like...
[153:36.34]Who did it?
[153:37.08]Here's the big reveal!
[153:38.83]We walk up to the person that we think it is.
[153:41.77]And then you hear... You look down and a bloody knife dropped out of my fucking shirt.
[153:48.57]And then the camera changes to Dagny's perspective and you start controlling Dagny and it was me.
[153:55.26]That'd be pretty cool.
[153:56.62]I'm gonna make a game that does that.
[153:59.88]Spoiler alert for my future game.
[154:01.76]Sorry.
[154:02.50]You'll know what happens.
[154:11.09]Did you know that dogs can have a little salami we already went over that You're like an hour and 12 minutes late, sorry So, where's the star Right there this design matches the one from those drawings
[154:33.80]Give me a break.
[154:36.48]There's more.
[154:40.60]There are more puzzles in the world than match numbers and have the sums of the numbers be next to each other.
[154:47.36]There's more puzzles than this that exist.
[154:55.38]Why does a puzzle have to be like this?
[155:01.76]This is just 700,000 games.
[155:05.10]Alright, place the number so that one of each number is within each outlined large triangle.
[155:21.30]Oh, man.
[155:21.96]Okay.
[155:22.54]I... Or is it...
[155:33.43]Each number has to be in each... It's just so... It's Sudoku.
[155:41.89]I never played Sudoku.
[155:43.67]I was a Picross.
[155:44.55]Why can't there be Picross?
[155:47.48]Are you shitting me?
[155:48.96]Look at these images.
[155:49.88]You tell me that these images were not made for Picross.
[155:52.98]Why would you have another math logic place the tile one?
[156:01.03]The Drew crew lives for this.
[156:08.51]Alright, let's go in a row.
[156:09.45]I said that we have, uh, 8, 6, so we need, uh, there's a 2 in there.
[156:13.07]Where's the 3?
[156:13.41]There's no 3 in there.
[156:14.43]Uh, where's the 4?
[156:15.67]There's no 4 in there.
[156:16.35]There is, is there a 5?
[156:17.49]No, there's no 5.
[156:18.13]Is there a 7?
[156:18.51]There's no 7.
[156:18.97]Okay, so 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[156:19.67]Uh, 7, 5, 7, what?
[156:20.03]Does it have to be horizontal?
[156:37.57]Horizontal row and dot.
[156:44.62]I thought this is... Is that okay?
[156:52.91]I don't know Sudoku.
[156:53.49]I didn't ever play Sudoku.
[156:58.89]Diagonals.
[156:59.79]Oh, it has to... Oh, for the love of God.
[157:02.90]It has to be fucking diagonals.
[157:11.64]I'm using my lifeline.
[157:14.25]The lifeline is phone gamer boomers game boomers dot com.
[157:23.45]Phone friend.
[157:27.18]Let's see what they say.
[157:36.30]He's cheating already.
[157:37.13]No, I don't want to do this.
[157:39.06]I don't like this one.
[157:40.14]Too many of these.
[157:41.86]Too many of these.
[157:46.26]Too many of these.
[157:47.28]I'm sorry.
[157:48.30]You gotta just call it like it is.
[157:50.94]Too many of these.
[158:02.99]Is cheating not allowed?
[158:04.71]That wasn't part of the deal.
[158:08.73]Don't you want to see who did it?
[158:11.75]He used GameBoomer's last stream of this game.
[158:14.95]That's so funny that this 38 or 37 Nancy Drew walkthroughs on GameBoomers.com That's so... Just so appropriate.
[158:36.60]Don't worry, I'm solving it.
[158:39.92]It's going to be so cool when you see the actual solution.
[158:45.92]There's too many numbers on the screen.
[158:47.10]I can't.
[158:47.40]My brain hurts.
[158:49.38]I want to open up the container and find the key and look under the desk and press the button and pull out the tray and match and sort.
[158:57.14]I don't want to do math.
[158:58.26]I'm sick of math.
[159:08.67]Seven.
[159:12.42]Oh, so by the way, I want to bring this up because this is something we're doing probably fairly soon, early into 2020.
[159:17.28]We're going to do an iPad stream.
[159:20.85]There are a shitload of games that have come out on the iPad.
[159:24.37]Some of them just seem absolutely outrageous that we have to play them.
[159:30.12]I've been saving them.
[159:32.17]Some of them have come out, some of them I've been, some of them are ad games.
[159:36.39]And what an ad game is, it's a game that I was playing, I was playing a different game.
[159:40.17]And then a 30 second take over the whole iPad ad came up.
[159:45.70]And it was this game that I have downloaded now.
[159:49.58]Uh, it should be interesting.
[159:51.20]A lot of them are ad games.
[159:54.49]So I'm probably gonna have to like wipe my iPad to factory settings.
[159:59.78]After doing this stream.
[160:01.42]I'm gonna have to.
[160:10.36]This puzzle isn't hard.
[160:11.52]No, I know I'm doing it.
[160:12.46]I'm doing it.
[160:15.88]I just have a game boomer in my corner in case I have trouble.
[160:26.07]Malware.
[160:29.26]Yeah, you gotta be careful with those games.
[160:39.79]My brother used to do these all the time.
[160:42.81]He used to try to show me how it worked.
[160:46.12]And I would always get halfway through his first sentence before I trailed off.
[160:52.90]And don't know what he was talking about.
[160:55.22]Got it.
[161:00.05]Got it. The final piece.
[161:04.05]Head into the tunnel, continue forward two steps then turn left and take one step forward.
[161:07.05]Buried in the cave wall to your left will be a chest containing a paltry sum.
[161:12.05]Should you be followed or forced by the town's treachery, simply reveal the decoy chest, the true treasure lies beyond that.
[161:19.05]Retrace your steps to the decoys treasure location, you'll find another passage leading up from there.
[161:23.05]Follow it, now recall the words I've sung to you many times.
[161:26.05]Press the images in the order they appear from start to end with those words as your guiding light.
[161:36.48]Let's go.
[161:43.13]Follow the instructions.
[161:51.08]And that was just... Oh yeah, that's the cat.
[161:53.14]I don't know why that sounds like unzipped pants.
[161:56.40]Or zip-up jacket.
[162:00.44]That was like zip-up pants, unzip jacket.
[162:03.74]It was one of those.
[162:12.52]Here we go.
[162:13.90]Alright, let's get... Where's the note?
[162:18.97]It was... Actually, I think I remember how to get there.
[162:22.51]Yeah, you just gotta go forward, forward.
[162:24.27]People said, what about that hand?
[162:27.07]Yeah, I've looked at it already.
[162:31.96]It's the guy's glove.
[162:33.98]Alright.
[162:34.36]Here we go.
[162:35.45]Just gonna make it down.
[162:36.37]Go up.
[162:39.89]Up.
[162:40.51]Here we are.
[162:41.71]Right.
[162:43.15]Right.
[162:44.85]Right.
[162:45.75]Forward.
[162:46.99]Here we go.
[162:47.63]You ready?
[162:48.09]There's a person down here.
[162:52.54]Are you hurt anywhere?
[163:01.83]No, but he's... he's coming back.
[163:05.07]Who is?
[163:05.91]No, he is.
[163:06.71]What?
[163:07.37]I knew it.
[163:08.11]His polite demeanour was all an act, wasn't it?
[163:10.98]It's true.
[163:12.20]He kept me here alone at first.
[163:14.50]Tried to get me to talk to him.
[163:15.98]So it was the guy that got the hit in the face at the bottom.
[163:17.30]Thought I was hiding information.
[163:18.68]But when he found out, I too didn't know the treasure's final location.
[163:23.01]He...
[163:24.07]Have you not eaten?
[163:26.31]Wait, we- everybody was just wicked mean to him and-
[163:54.45]Still doesn't excuse everything else he's done.
[163:56.77]You could have been hurt.
[163:58.75]Maybe Sauron could have been hurt.
[164:00.29]He explained this?
[164:01.05]Yeah, I know, but I thought he couldn't make it up.
[164:03.98]Maybe this is a wake-up call for all of us.
[164:14.81]What is that?
[164:15.09]Oh, I thought it was an animal.
[164:37.92]How do you have service down here?
[164:40.00]Oh.
[164:40.20]We already know how to get out of here.
[164:42.54]I've been- I've been- Oh, the cave is collapsing.
[165:10.12]It was me.
[165:11.52]Wait, what?
[165:12.20]He doesn't have a bruise.
[165:15.72]The treasure.
[165:16.53]Quick, quick, push him.
[165:17.73]Run, ram him at full speed right now.
[165:19.57]His back is turned.
[165:41.55]That's not a swing, that thing.
[165:43.11]He's gonna lift it up and it's gonna be too heavy for him.
[165:46.56]What?
[165:49.80]Wait, I don't... Is it weird that if I think, okay, if he swung that axe at me and hit me, I don't think it would do that much damage.
[166:08.43]You still have to swing it and hit it hard.
[166:10.43]It might get me pretty bad, maybe a little bit, but I think I could take him.
[166:13.53]I think I could take him.
[166:17.45]It probably wouldn't be that bad of a wound.
[166:21.37]Not a chance right now.
[166:25.03]Okay, so we... Am I supposed to be running away from him?
[166:30.17]The ice is more fragile than I thought.
[166:32.83]I'll need to find another way out.
[166:40.94]Are you gonna do anything?
[166:43.56]You guys don't think I can take him?
[166:50.98]Okay, goodbye.
[166:53.10]Nice menacing talk that we had.
[167:02.86]look there's your treasure the crest of the east India company and the detail it's exquisite after all these years I found it it was all worth it
[167:20.64]Alright.
[167:21.46]That's just like a big... It's like a playhouse.
[167:24.58]Like a dollhouse.
[167:26.12]I could take that hit.
[167:26.74]I really could.
[167:27.68]That would hurt.
[167:28.18]But it wouldn't do that much damage.
[167:48.15]He just killed you.
[167:48.91]No, he didn't.
[167:51.25]Find the real treasure.
[167:52.68]There's another... Okay, there's an illusory wall back here that he didn't see.
[168:04.94]Sorry, dude.
[168:05.52]You missed the entire... You missed the entire tree level.
[168:10.09]Sorry, Soren.
[168:15.44]Wow, this has to be the real treasure.
[168:18.63]It's not a myth after all.
[168:22.23]These images are from Lawrence's final letter.
[168:25.35]I just need to press them correctly.
[168:29.16]Press the images in the correct order according to Lawrence's final letter.
[168:32.44]Is this it?
[168:43.25]No.
[168:43.71]Is this it?
[168:52.22]Now recall the words I've sung to you so many times.
[168:55.98]What is the song?
[169:50.98]I'm sorry.
[169:51.98]Okay.
[169:54.83]Where's the song?
[170:03.33]Oh.
[170:04.47]Do you speak English?
[170:05.83]Yes, little.
[170:06.95]No, that's not lyrics to a song.
[170:12.30]Where's the song?
[170:15.20]You have my song and the, where is it?
[170:18.46]Here we go.
[170:19.64]A foreign shore behind me and a hundred more to go.
[170:24.41]On stormy season, starless nights caught on a cold wind's blow.
[170:29.83]So many years have put my battered bow up to the test.
[170:35.31]Along, just who cares?
[170:43.44]I have to put this... I like my way better.
[171:22.40]What?
[171:22.70]I did them all.
[171:28.42]Oh.
[171:29.42]Ooh!
[171:30.92]Wait, what was that?
[171:41.67]Fuck.
[171:47.57]What?
[171:53.30]What the fuck?
[172:12.15]No, your dog died, so you broke your heart.
[172:15.01]How is that not part of the song?
[172:30.48]I must have been the first to get this back.
[172:31.63]Holy shit.
[172:32.71]This is incredible.
[172:34.43]Nancy, are you back there?
[172:36.75]Magnus, I'm here.
[172:38.29]I found the real deal.
[172:40.11]But I think I'm stuck now.
[172:41.11]I wouldn't say anything.
[172:42.25]I'm not sure how to get over to the exit.
[172:45.35]Yeah, I'm stuck back here.
[172:46.49]Well, that works.
[172:47.92]Bunch of ice.
[172:49.24]Help.
[172:49.50]Go get help.
[172:50.46]The treasure Soren found was a fake?
[172:52.40]Yes.
[172:52.84]Captain Lawrence hid the real chest so that only his true descendants knew where to find it.
[172:57.79]Well, it's yours now.
[172:59.17]I don't think so.
[173:00.22]This treasure belongs to the town, not me.
[173:03.34]Nancy, thank goodness.
[173:04.10]We have Soren in custody.
[173:05.16]My guys caught him right as he was leaving the cave.
[173:06.82]That was close.
[173:07.30]Nancy, you can take one coin.
[173:08.58]No one's paying you.
[173:21.44]you can take a small shoe box and rifle in just three or four handfuls of gold coins and just stick it just down the front of your pants and just leave it there you know what I mean like I would just put it in my underwear just stick it down straight down to the back of my underwear and then cover it with a big jacket that's okay Nancy you can get the rest
[173:46.48]Soren tried to kill us
[173:56.91]Did I win?
[173:57.15]Arrested in the cave.
[173:58.05]Ice jail.
[174:17.40]knocked him unconscious, and took him to the ice caves using his dinghy.
[174:21.64]When he realized Magnus didn't know the final location, he came after me.
[174:26.43]Luckily, I beat him to the finish line.
[174:29.01]The treasure is in good hands with Elizabeth.
[174:31.55]Her family legacy has finally come full circle.
[174:34.91]Magnus apologized to Elizabeth for having been so distant leading up to the festival.
[174:39.45]Another case closed.
[174:40.27]Did they go with the boat?
[174:41.55]What?
[175:03.19]He's still pretty cranky when it comes to tourists, but I think he'll get the hang of things.
[175:07.53]Dagny and Magnus donated their exploration rights to the Hirlikide back to Skiprot.
[175:11.78]The ship is now fully public property and is open to tourists at all times of the year.
[175:16.74]Dagny stayed in Skiprot for a little while, but she split soon after she got her share of the treasure.
[175:21.82]At first she seemed content to stay, but after a couple of days with no action, it seemed like she was itching to get out on the road.
[175:28.75]She didn't say much about where she was going, but I later found a note in my room at the pub.
[175:33.43]Catch you later, friend.
[175:34.49]I gave Ned the anniversary gift I got him from the Skip Rock gift shop.
[175:38.83]As far as apology gifts go, I probably... Hey, Ned, I found like $60 million in gold coins.
[175:46.08]Here's a souvenir from the gift shop.
[175:49.68]As for me, I think my time in the land of fire and ice is coming to a close.
[175:54.34]I'll miss the sky full of stars, but I've been in darkness a long time now.
[175:58.76]I can't wait to see the sun again.
[176:00.74]Love, Nancy.
[176:04.36]Which was not one of the waterfront shops.
[176:07.15]The Heart of Odin.
[176:09.07]Ooh, I get to nominate awards.
[176:13.19]The award... What?
[176:15.83]What are you talking about?
[176:19.61]Did it know?
[176:25.27]How did it know?
[176:30.18]Nice job on the game facts usage.
[176:42.33]You do know.
[176:43.13]It only took you months to solve the case.
[176:45.71]Put a little love in your heart.
[176:47.17]Egged.
[176:47.51]Time to make an omelet.
[176:50.01]Look out.
[176:50.35]You're not afraid of heights.
[176:51.37]Compulsive spender or compl- Oh yeah, because there's a sword.
[176:53.79]I didn't get the sword.
[176:59.32]Wait a minute, the prequel to the last- the last one we did!
[177:01.54]Hang the phone up and call the police, your house is on fire.
[177:29.14]We already did that one.
[177:37.30]We already did that one.
[177:45.67]Play that one, it looks good.
[177:46.67]Is this Nancy Drew singing?
[177:50.03]This is a real song!
[177:55.99]Nancy Drew in the live concert.
[177:58.24]I could probably sing.
[178:02.38]I could probably sing like this if I wanted to.
[178:26.78]Try and play Ninja Turtles.
[178:28.88]You still remember that?
[178:32.20]People are going to be really mad.
[178:41.79]I already saw those.
[178:47.23]Alright.
[178:48.01]That was Nancy Drew, Sea of Darkness.
[178:50.08]Pretty cool.
[178:51.46]Pretty, pretty cool.
[178:53.68]Pretty cool.
[178:58.65]Time to go play Tetherball.
[179:02.65]Next Drew game.
[179:03.47]I'm not going right into another Nancy Drew game, guys.
[179:11.45]No.
[179:15.28]I'm not done streaming, but I'm not going into Nancy Drew.
[179:20.78]We solved another case.
[179:22.18]Until next time.
[179:27.05]Alright, let me go pee.
[179:29.09]And I'll get us something else to do for a little bit.
[179:32.94]Vote on the poll if you haven't.
[179:33.86]You've got three days.
[179:34.50]I'll be right back.
[185:35.26]He's never coming back, is he?
[185:40.10]He is, he is.
[185:41.02]Alright, what am I going to do?
[185:44.31]What should we do?
[185:47.59]What do we got time for?
[185:50.87]Let's just get $50.
[185:51.29]$50.
[185:51.33]Hold on.
[185:59.21]5,000 bits.
[186:00.73]That's a shitload of money, thank you.
[186:04.61]Not going right into the next Nancy Drew game just proves that you're not really part of the Drew crew.
[186:13.54]That's not even true, though.
[186:15.88]That's not true.
[186:19.36]That's not true.
[186:21.50]I am part of the Drew crew.
[186:25.97]I originated Drew crew.
[186:28.97]Well, I mean, I didn't, but I did.
[186:33.68]But I didn't.
[186:37.88]I was part of the, I was in the same room as the Dru-Kru origination.
[186:44.71]You know what I'm saying?
[186:45.75]I was there.
[186:47.59]I was in the room.
[186:50.65]He's a true Dru-er.
[186:55.78]That's right.
[186:56.24]Alright.
[186:58.24]I know that was a bad voice crack.
[186:59.54]Alright, let me get this open.
[187:04.40]Okay.
[187:06.84]Looks good.
[187:10.51]No more tier lists.
[187:11.57]Are there any more tier lists to do?
[187:14.55]I don't think there are.
[187:15.33]Are there?
[187:22.65]Yeah, animals?
[187:27.62]Hold on a second.
[187:34.25]What the fuck?
[187:37.77]Wait, what?
[187:38.21]I can't... Why?
[187:41.21]What is going on here?
[187:52.34]Did I get the wrong thing?
[187:55.61]I think I got the wrong program.
[188:02.66]Shit.
[188:04.00]Uh-oh.
[188:05.96]Uh-oh.
[188:09.78]Did I click on like an ad?
[188:12.36]I may have clicked an ad.
[188:16.49]Oh, fuck.
[188:17.17]Wait a minute.
[188:17.87]This is bad.
[188:19.03]Actually bad.
[188:20.65]Yeah, this is actually bad.
[188:21.81]Hold on.
[188:22.29]This is actually really, really, really bad.
[188:24.15]Hold on.
[192:04.78]What?
[192:08.22]Why do I look so I look I look strange today.
[192:10.66]Why?
[192:14.24]You didn't notice that?
[192:19.17]I was muted the entire I was muted the entire time.
[192:25.22]Are you serious?
[192:27.22]Okay.
[192:29.56]It crashed.
[192:30.92]So I said, okay, looks like we're not doing that.
[192:34.62]The game fucking crashed.
[192:38.20]And I can't, it's fucked up.
[192:41.25]Wait, did you guys not hear anything I was saying when I told you I downloaded a fucking virus?
[192:49.77]What?
[192:50.87]You didn't hear any of that when I said that like, oh shit, I think I downloaded a virus.
[193:02.70]You did that.
[193:03.22]That's the last thing you heard.
[193:04.22]Alright.
[193:08.84]You know what?
[193:09.34]I could put on a medieval.
[193:11.62]What if I just open up?
[193:12.54]No, I can't do that.
[193:13.64]Fuck.
[193:17.08]What can we do right now to...
[193:21.11]You didn't finish Nancy Drew.
[193:22.65]I didn't finish a medieval.
[193:25.85]Go back to Jump King and do the Jump King DLC.
[193:33.82]There is not a single chance in hell I'm going to do that.
[193:47.99]Now, alright, so here's what's going to happen.
[193:49.75]I really didn't think Nancy Drew was going to take three hours.
[193:51.41]I thought it was going to take like four or five.
[193:55.33]So, what do we got?
[193:57.01]What do I got right now on Steam?
[193:58.15]Let's see.
[193:59.17]Because no more heroes was supposed to be today.
[194:01.82]But I've had some trouble getting it to run.
[194:04.76]So, that's what's going to happen tomorrow no matter what.
[194:09.74]What the hell should I even do for the next hour or two?
[194:14.14]What do I have installed on Steam?
[194:15.61]I got a couple of new games.
[194:16.71]Let me see what they are.
[194:19.72]Play GTA?
[194:21.28]No, I'd want that to be its own thing.
[194:25.88]AI Dungeon?
[194:26.66]I can't do AI.
[194:27.76]I can't do that right now.
[194:28.66]I need to set that all up again.
[194:31.52]I have to go back to the collab website and it's going to take 15-20 minutes to build it up again.
[194:35.68]Let me see.
[194:42.24]Halo Reach?
[194:43.02]No, I'm not playing Halo Reach.
[194:47.10]What do I have installed?
[194:59.01]DOS?
[195:00.55]I could do DOS.
[195:01.97]Or... Or... You know, there's another game I have on this list that I haven't played in a while.
[195:11.54]And it's going to piss off some people, but it's going to make some people happy.
[195:16.20]Let's see how many people we make happy.
[195:19.10]What's the over-under on people that are going to be upset right now?
[195:21.32]Why don't...
[195:37.97]Anybody know what this is?
[195:40.64]It's not House Flipper.
[195:41.68]It's not House Flipper.
[195:42.40]You're wrong.
[195:42.74]Yeah, you got it.
[196:15.67]It's time to relax.
[196:19.96]I said it earlier.
[196:20.92]I said the word earlier.
[196:22.98]And now I just want to do it.
[196:24.68]I just want to play it now.
[196:26.98]What is this?
[196:28.46]15 by 15?

[196:30.60]I don't know what... I don't want... I don't want to see that!
[196:35.00]Why is it showing me that?

[196:42.84]That's a spoiler.
[196:55.87]No, I didn't already do these.
[196:59.33]Don't look at it.
[197:04.29]Hold on, can I turn it off?
[197:08.71]Auto fade numbers.

[198:39.00]I'm not set up for that, though.
[198:40.30]It's going to take even more time.
[198:44.59]I probably will just open up Nancy Drew episode fucking 34.
[198:47.83]No, I can't.
[198:54.35]I can't do that.
[198:55.59]Oh my God.
[198:56.37]I'm going to do it.

[199:02.23]Alright.
[199:02.69]Stop.
[199:04.37]What is it?
[199:05.73]Nancy Drew, the secret of the old clock.
[199:24.90]Fuck you, dude.
[199:25.44]Pick Ross.
[199:26.48]I can't.
[199:27.08]I'm sorry.
[199:28.44]I can't.
[199:31.19]You know why?
[199:31.79]Because I haven't done one of these in a long time.
[199:33.83]Let's open up the clock.
[199:35.13]Okay, clock time.
[199:37.23]Fucking Nancy Drew.
[199:38.11]Why are you taking over my whole channel?
[199:43.78]Alright.
[199:49.92]It's going to be loud.
[199:50.64]Just exit out of here.
[199:52.18]My fate is sealed.
[199:53.35]By the way, PictoPix is a great fucking game.
[199:55.01]I highly recommend it.
[200:00.57]Shit.
[200:03.23]Secret of the old clock.
[200:04.43]Here it comes.
[200:04.91]The place, the road to Titusville, where we find Nancy Drew behind the wheel of a blue roadster pondering this question.
[200:17.13]What was the question?
[200:18.13]What was the question?
[200:18.71]What was the question?
[200:20.01]What was the question?
[200:20.97]What?
[200:21.11]What's the question?
[200:44.05]Hold on, I have to- What is this happening to me?
[200:47.17]Alright, wait a second.
[200:49.01]Finally!
[200:49.49]Okay, cap.
[200:55.05]Secret of the old clock.
[200:56.43]This one probably sucks, by the way.
[200:58.39]Game setup.
[201:00.37]Can I even capture this shit?
[201:01.89]Why can't I capture this?
[201:23.36]Capture this!
[201:27.22]I can't capture it.
[201:27.88]It's like an old one.
[201:31.93]Alright, I'm gonna try this.
[201:33.25]Hold on.
[201:33.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:43.56]Okay, this should work.
[201:48.17]Can I capture this like its own window?
[201:49.53]Why was this what we're gonna... Oh my fucking god.
[201:52.47]Just play Jump... I can't... No.
[201:53.89]I'm not playing Jump King.
[201:55.81]I'm not gonna get stuffed into a corner and play the DLC of Jump King.
[201:59.60]And like poo my pants.
[202:01.14]That's not gonna happen.
[202:02.12]No.
[202:03.04]No.
[202:03.70]No.
[202:04.18]No.
[202:04.64]No.
[202:05.22]Clock.
[202:05.78]The clock.
[202:06.62]Nancy Drew and the mystery of the fucking grandfather clock.
[202:09.71]Here we go.
[202:10.55]It's coming on screen right now.
[202:14.07]He's too afraid.
[202:14.65]No.
[202:14.83]I'm not doing it.
[202:18.29]Why can I not capture this shit?
[202:30.80]Oh my god, Nancy Drew.
[202:32.28]I'm gonna just have to fucking install another one.
[202:45.48]Like, what?
[202:46.26]There's no windows even open, apparently.
[202:51.10]Nancy's betraying us.
[202:53.10]Hold on, let me try one more thing.
[202:54.08]Let's see if this works.
[203:05.97]The year, 1930.
[203:07.83]The place, the road to Titusville, where we find Nancy Drew behind the wheel of her...
[203:16.80]Fuck.
[203:24.35]Where is it?
[203:26.21]Give it to me!
[203:27.59]Wrong- Got it!
[203:43.49]No I don't.
[203:55.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[203:57.46]I got it.
[203:58.34]This actually will work.
[204:01.59]I'm just going to capture my entire fucking computer.
[204:03.27]Who cares?
[204:03.61]Hold on, let me just take everything that's on the desktop and stuff it into a fucking folder.
[204:13.07]Alright, everything's going into my folder.
[204:14.55]I don't even know what this stuff is, but like I have- there's like a bank statement on my fucking desktop.
[204:19.78]Hold on, wait a second.
[204:24.36]I have like- I have like my credit card info is right here.
[204:28.06]Wait, let me- hold on.
[204:31.92]Dude, I have like six new folders.
[204:35.24]I'm gonna have so much trouble finding so much of this shit.
[204:43.64]Alright.
