[00:13.01]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14.63]Welcome to episode... I don't remember, but it's a good one.
[00:20.07]Because we're going to be playing Portal 2 tonight.
[00:23.37]And this game is ridiculous.
[00:25.21]And hopefully I don't fucking puke.
[00:28.02]Because I came close last time I tried this game.
[00:31.76]But Jeremy told me I had to do it because it's fun.
[00:35.04]And it's one of the best games of the year when it came out.
[00:37.86]So let's just get right into it here.
[00:40.28]The Puzzle Master Grandpa!
[00:43.94]Okay, so I gotta grab this... What the... Who the fuck is that?
[00:47.88]Who's that little grapefruit?
[00:49.46]What the fuck was that guy?
[00:51.53]Whatever, I'll probably see you another time.
[00:53.25]But let's just get this going here.
[00:54.87]Gotta drop this thing here.
[00:57.15]Get the cube over on this side.
[00:59.45]So I need a... I need an orange portal.
[01:01.92]And then I gotta grab this and... Oh, yeah.
[01:05.54]No, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:07.08]Hold on.
[01:08.24]Okay.
[01:10.96]Gonna give challenge mode a whirl here for a second.
[01:13.64]Okay, I gotta do... There's a thing blocking here, so I gotta shoot one over here, and then one over this way.
[01:21.61]Uh, no, I need an orange one.
[01:24.17]Okay, so then I go in this one, and I jump across the whole thing, right?
[01:28.83]No, that's not gonna fucking work.
[01:30.99]Alright, maybe I didn't stand on it long enough.
[01:32.69]Let me stand on it.
[01:33.63]One, two, now... What the fuck?!
[01:36.71]I've been playing this level for like ten minutes!
[01:39.35]What am I supposed to do?! !
[01:41.94]I mean, the amount of intelligence that I have in problem solving really is just unbelievable.
[01:48.10]And, you know, sometimes a genius takes time.
[01:51.34]So if you want to try and criticize me, then you can GTFO.
[01:56.33]You know what that stands for?
[01:57.35]It stands for get the fuck out of here!
[02:00.41]I've got to get across it this way.
[02:02.33]So I think if I make a portal here...
[02:04.96]And then maybe one up top here so I can fling myself forward.
[02:08.40]I don't know.
[02:08.78]Let me try it.
[02:10.21]So then I jump in here.
[02:12.07]And then... Oh, what did I just do?
[02:15.33]Oh, shit.
[02:21.36]I'm sorry.
[02:22.29]No, Grandpa, no.
[02:24.27]Come on.
[02:25.07]I'm sorry.
[02:26.17]I specifically told you not to play this game.
[02:30.11]But I had to.
[02:31.49]You can't handle it.
[02:32.81]Yes, I could, but I'm sorry.
[02:35.70]We gotta clean this up.
[02:36.56]This is disgusting.
[02:38.02]It's everywhere.
[02:39.68]It's all over the keyboard.
