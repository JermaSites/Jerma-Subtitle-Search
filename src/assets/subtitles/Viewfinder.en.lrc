[00:08.12]Somebody said it's a lame title.
[00:11.22]Well, I'm retired now, so I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[00:17.84]How's it going?
[00:24.41]Are you going to play Armored Core?
[00:26.07]Yeah, we need to talk about Armored Core because I have some thoughts.
[00:33.79]I have a few thoughts.
[00:40.82]I've heard.
[00:41.38]I've heard it's very, very, very difficult.
[00:47.50]I've heard it has a very, very large learning curve.
[00:53.29]And I mean, I would be jumping into.
[00:59.79]The return of the Jedi without watching any of the other Star Wars movies.
[01:04.92]So I don't know.
[01:07.62]Maybe.
[01:13.65]not true I heard it was really hard I heard it was okay here's what I heard is that I love FromSoftware I love Dark Souls I love Elden Ring oh yay here comes another FromSoftware game it's just this is not Elden Ring dude this is a different game this is a completely different experience
[01:42.93]How about this?
[01:45.09]Maybe I'll open it.
[01:46.31]I'll try it.
[01:48.33]But if it's clear that I'm just like completely have no idea what I'm doing.
[01:53.80]And it's just like, oh, I'm having a lot of trouble.
[01:58.24]Then we might just move away to something else that day.
[02:02.65]You'll love it.
[02:03.91]I'll give it a try.
[02:04.49]I will.
[02:05.93]But I've never played any of the Armored Core games.
[02:10.03]Any of them.
[02:10.63]I don't even know if I like this genre.
[02:17.68]I'll try the new food, but I will be honest with you at the restaurant.
[02:22.71]Oh, hey, try this.
[02:23.63]It's got cilantro.
[02:25.47]It's got the squid in it, and it's got a potato mash on top.
[02:30.31]I'll try it, but I'm going to tell you.
[02:31.65]I'll take a bite, and I'm going to go, it's alright.
[02:33.61]Not for me.
[02:35.07]Or I might go, nice.
[02:39.30]You know what I'm saying?
[02:40.78]I'll try the new food, but I can't promise I will love it.
[02:48.34]What kind of freak doesn't like robots?
[02:55.60]I like robots.
[02:57.30]I just don't know if I'm going to be good at playing as a robot.
[03:09.29]But anyways, let's talk about the next week or so.
[03:14.61]First of all, we're going to play Viewfinder tonight.
[03:17.91]Today.
[03:20.99]I have a plan to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[03:25.67]If not today, then maybe on Monday or something.
[03:28.75]We'll see.
[03:31.16]Also, at the end of this coming week, I want to continue Sorcery Part 4.
[03:37.92]And I will try... I almost just said Assassin's Creed 6.
[03:45.26]Armored Core 6.
[03:52.27]That's the plan for this coming week.
[03:54.87]Probably streaming and streaming today, streaming Monday and then probably on like Saturday, Sunday, maybe like Sunday this coming weekend.
[04:03.71]But for today.
[04:06.05]Let's play Viewfinder.
[04:07.07]But the highlights too.
[04:12.72]Yeah.
[04:16.36]I know.
[04:20.87]Do you have to play the Assassin's Creed now?
[04:26.71]He's never gonna play Hylics.
[04:30.21]I definitely will.
[04:36.35]What about Minecraft?
[04:40.65]I don't think so.
[04:44.05]What about the Smurf cosplay stream?
[04:51.25]I never said I was doing a Smurfs cosplay.
[04:55.51]When are you going to reveal that you're balding?
[04:58.09]Somebody in pre-stream chat said, oh, hey, dude, like, have you started balding?
[05:02.83]And I was in the middle of typing a reply to this person, but I stopped and I deleted it all.
[05:08.11]I deleted everything because I'm not going to even talk about that because, you know what I mean?
[05:14.95]Like, I'm not going to type or address like anything about me, my hair, my balding or anything.
[05:21.93]I'm not even going to talk about it.
[05:23.71]You know what I'm saying?
[05:24.27]Do you know what I mean by that?
[05:25.27]Like, I'm not going to even start talking about that.
[05:28.35]Because I ain't manifesting anything.
[05:32.07]So I'm going to have no comment on that.
[05:40.48]My hair is great.
[05:42.06]I'm not making any comments besides that.
[05:44.86]I've got pretty good hair right now.
[05:47.16]It's the only comment I'm going to make.
[05:59.98]You address it constantly.
[06:02.88]Yeah, but I address it jokingly constantly.
[06:07.73]It was a that was a real question in freestream.
[06:10.79]And I was like, Oh, yeah, well, here's the thing, man.
[06:12.47]Like, let me tell you about.
[06:13.67]No, no, no, no, I'm not gonna.
[06:15.13]I'm not gonna sincerely address it.
[06:16.76]No way.
[06:19.28]How many hot dogs do you think you could eat in 45 seconds?
[06:21.18]Let me think.
[06:23.08]Probably two.
[06:27.36]Maybe the full one.
[06:29.78]I don't know.
[06:30.48]I've never tried.
[06:30.98]I would say one.
[06:36.86]One sounds like fine.
[06:38.40]Maybe.
[06:39.40]But that's not something I would recommend trying.
[06:44.07]How about this?
[06:51.77]How long do I have?
[06:54.21]Give me a number.
[06:54.67]Give me like 10 minutes.
[06:55.45]What's the...
[06:58.55]How long in a hot dog competition do you have to eat all the hot dogs that are out there?
[07:04.73]What's like a typical hot dog competition timer?
[07:06.88]10 minutes?
[07:14.18]30 minutes?
[07:14.46]Okay, I would eat one over the course of 30 minutes and I would eat it with a fork and knife during the competition.
[07:25.65]I'll be like, here we go, everybody, welcome to the hot dog contest, let's go!
[07:29.15]Three, two, one, let's fucking... Everyone's freaking out and I just slowly take one and just start cutting the end off and choosing which dipping sauce I'm gonna put it in.
[07:44.86]No, that's what I'll do first.
[07:46.58]I will make sure that there's 10 different dipping sauces and I slowly make a little pool on the plate with each one.
[07:54.90]And I will, like, make, oh, exquisite faces every time I take a bite.
[08:02.28]That was a Malcolm in the Middle joke?
[08:03.70]That's a good one.
[08:04.84]That's a good episode, if that's real.
[08:08.45]That was a Malcolm in the... Alright, well then, yeah, that's a funny joke.
[08:12.53]I like it.
[08:13.85]I should watch that episode.
[08:24.44]I don't think they even have dipping sauces past the water jug.
[08:38.14]Once I get my headphones, it's over for you hoes.
[08:41.34]I don't know how yet, but it will be.
[08:45.70]What are you talking about?
[08:54.37]That person is really excited to get a new pair of headphones.
[08:59.55]And I'll tell you, I've been there before where you're just like, oh man, I'm going to be powered up once I get this new thing.
[09:10.44]You ever just feel like completely energized, there's like a new thing coming up?
[09:18.57]Soft retirements, soft hair loss.
[09:20.43]Do not out.
[09:22.07]I actually want you to time that person out.
[09:23.98]I don't want that message to be recorded into history.
[09:28.64]I want that message deleted because I don't want to manifest that.
[09:31.74]I want that to be deleted.
[09:32.62]And then here it comes.
[09:36.76]Everybody say it.
[09:37.36]Here it comes.
[09:47.19]I'm doing just fine.
[09:48.29]I'm doing alright.
[09:49.85]Manifest some fucking hair.
[09:52.49]Yeah, it's luscious right now.
[09:54.47]I've been manifesting it since I've been drinking green tea since I was fucking 19, alright?
[10:02.58]That's how you manifested.
[10:13.85]Can I have your comb when you're finally gone?
[10:19.22]Ah, that's going in the museum somewhere.
[10:28.85]Such like an ego- That's such egomania, I know.
[10:34.15]Alright, if you wanted to see like the sign-up sheet for the Museum of History, of Entertainment History,
[10:45.84]I would bet, out of all the things in that museum, the Jerma985 comb in the glass gets the least amount of sign-ups for that part of the tour.
[11:03.69]They might even have to move it to a different room eventually.
[11:06.93]That's going to get moved three or four times before it just gets put in storage.
[11:11.73]And then I get a call asking for me to come get it.
[11:28.26]Alright, you guys ready?
[11:28.86]Uh, no more stalling.
[11:32.87]They'll put the baseball on display.
[11:39.86]No, they will not.
[11:42.00]Don't you have a copy of your face?
[11:43.46]Yes.
[11:46.82]And I don't like it at all.
[11:52.09]Okay, the reason why this thing is weird is because there's constantly a mirror when there is no mirror.
[12:00.48]We all know looking in the mirror, you see your face.
[12:03.12]Being able to see your face when there is no mirror is something.
[12:09.18]Honestly, I put a towel over it.
[12:18.17]I don't want to see it.
[12:18.85]It's weird.
[12:30.24]You laugh like a gnome.
[12:31.62]That's fine.
[12:32.64]That's kind of cool.
[12:34.88]Show it.
[12:35.30]No.
[12:36.67]I don't even have it.
[12:37.37]I lied.
[12:38.03]I don't even have it.
[12:38.93]It's not even here.
[12:54.32]Turn on facecam one and just have it be the mold.
[12:56.72]Now that would be really funny.
[12:58.52]Except the problem with that is... Somebody would like... Would like get it and like zoom in and like... With AI generated fucking knowledge.
[13:08.63]It would hit every single point and they'd be able to make one.
[13:12.75]You can do that now.
[13:14.61]Oh, never mind.
[13:15.17]Who cares?
[13:29.32]You should sell it or something.
[13:30.86]No, that's very weird.
[13:37.58]He's obsessed with himself.
[13:45.23]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[13:49.15]You should sell it, but attach it to a life-size stretch arm strong.
[13:59.49]No.
[14:02.55]Hey, speaking of things that are going on sale soon.
[14:06.93]On 28th in a couple days, U2 is just going up.
[14:11.15]That's not a mold of my face, but that is my likeness.
[14:16.67]Pretty cool.
[14:17.03]Alright, let's play.
[14:23.69]Bro, play the game.
[14:25.00]I'm just chilling, relaxing.
[14:38.09]Bro, don't play the game.
[14:40.33]I won't.
[14:41.59]Relax.
[14:41.89]I'm not going to.
[14:46.35]Okay.
[14:47.51]Let's do it.
[14:47.93]I'm going to move over here.
[14:52.30]You should be able to hear the game now.
[14:56.10]Viewfinder.
[14:57.00]If you guys remember that we played this during the demo.
[15:00.74]Demo.
[15:01.60]Whatever it was.
[15:02.20]The Steam demo.
[15:05.54]Thing.
[15:08.77]Whatever it was.
[15:09.69]It was fun.
[15:12.23]It's a game where you take pictures and the pictures become part of the world that you can place.
[15:18.00]It was very fun.
[15:20.06]And let's freaking go.
[15:32.17]You'll get it if you don't get it very soon here.
[15:35.79]How's the audio?
[15:36.33]Is it good?
[15:37.85]Coffee?
[15:40.76]When are you going to finish Breath of the Wild?
[15:46.79]You know what?
[15:48.35]I will.
[15:48.61]It's not right now.
[16:01.44]Is there a sprint?
[16:02.04]I don't remember.
[16:02.46]I don't think there is.
[16:03.08]How's the audio?
[16:04.68]Can you hear it good?
[16:08.51]I've never seen this much overgrowth before.
[16:10.54]I did that before and it scared me again.
[16:14.20]Oh, that's right.
[16:15.14]There's a rewind.
[16:15.92]That was sick.
[16:43.73]yeah it's rewind time should I say that every time what's an old photograph doing here and just hype it up for a full minute that's gonna be so annoying if you're like a new viewer this is like shut the up dude and play stop just play why do you have to do like this weird thing every time
[17:14.77]Can you do something with it?
[17:15.87]Oh, that's right.
[17:16.35]Okay, I can place this over here.
[17:18.05]So check this out.
[17:18.95]Watch this.
[17:20.91]Check this out.
[17:21.33]You ready?
[17:26.86]Did... Hang on.
[17:28.06]Did you just shift reality?
[17:30.12]Let's go.
[17:32.24]Put the phrase on a soundboard.
[17:33.88]That's kind of funny.
[17:34.54]Alright, hold on.
[17:37.65]What should I say?
[17:39.19]Like...
[17:40.77]Rewind, bros!
[17:42.27]Can I get a countdown?
[17:43.43]We're going into rewind- Ah, I fucked it up.
[17:45.55]Hold on.
[17:48.89]Hey, I can't even do it.
[17:49.67]Why not?
[17:53.77]Why is my GoXLR fucked up?
[17:55.13]I can't even do it.
[17:56.89]I think it's broken.
[17:57.89]I can't do it.
[18:00.41]Well, it was funny for like five seconds.
[18:01.53]We got it.
[18:01.79]Alright, the batteries.
[18:04.95]I remember the batteries.
[18:08.93]Have confidence in yourself.
[18:12.78]Yeah, when you do acting, if you do voice acting, you're going to do a few takes sometimes.
[18:20.01]You can't get it perfect every time.
[18:25.19]That just means you're a bad actor.
[18:26.39]That's fine.
[18:29.07]Shut up.
[18:35.11]Oh yeah, soft retirement stream.
[18:36.85]Let's go.
[18:37.31]No, I'm not going to talk about that every five seconds, by the way.
[18:47.15]I need one more.
[18:55.26]Does this mean it works if it's black and white?
[19:01.96]Cool.
[19:04.18]Hey, can you say hi to my cat?
[19:06.10]Yeah.
[19:06.30]Come here.
[19:13.92]Did it work?
[19:23.82]Oh, you know what I'm going to have to do?
[19:35.41]This is just the tutorial.
[19:37.69]We're good.
[19:38.17]Is it true that you're moving into a nursing home?
[19:51.41]I have an I have an idea or.
[19:55.17]You know what?
[19:55.67]No, I'm not manifesting this because it's funny.
[20:06.14]Take the jump.
[20:12.58]I care.
[20:23.73]Alright, now this is where it's going to get pretty crazy.
[20:32.74]Throw it into the ocean?
[20:33.90]Didn't we talk about this on the Hitman stream from like years ago?
[20:37.92]Like if you threw a car battery into the ocean, like what happens?
[20:43.06]You know what I mean?
[20:44.12]Like we've talked about this.
[20:46.04]How much electricity needs to like electrocute the water in the ocean?
[20:53.72]How far does it spread?
[20:59.88]Electric eels are so weird.
[21:02.18]What a wild creature.
[21:04.80]They have organs in their body that hold charges and then discharge.
[21:14.13]It's like two or three different organs that do different types of charging, right?
[21:17.25]It's so wild.
[21:22.98]Their magic?
[21:26.56]Yeah, they kind of are.
[21:31.62]You know how many times I've made a joke about shooting electricity out of my hands?
[21:41.29]There is a creature on this Earth that does that.
[21:46.67]No, sit here and think about that for one second.
[21:48.33]Just bear with me here.
[21:50.08]There is a creature on Earth that shoots electricity out of its body to hurt stuff.
[21:56.72]Excuse me?
[21:57.20]That's not a TV show.
[22:01.58]That's a real life.
[22:04.68]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[22:05.56]Where am I going?
[22:22.17]Oh, this is like a hub world.
[22:23.44]Okay.
[22:23.76]I get it.
[22:33.64]Are you high?
[22:34.14]Be honest.
[22:34.56]No.
[22:35.51]So you can revisit levels.
[22:38.23]That's cool.
[22:38.89]Okay.
[22:40.87]There's another one that's going to be active I can use then.
[22:44.29]I think.
[22:47.98]How do I turn?
[22:48.38]Oh, here we go.
[22:52.01]You answered way too quickly.
[22:55.01]Now, this would be an awful game to do that with.
[22:57.25]Are you kidding me?
[22:57.86]That would be so bad.
[22:59.74]Do you understand that if that were the case, I would sit here like this for like 10 straight minutes?
[23:06.36]And people would be like, did he go BRB?
[23:08.06]And then eventually I would just move.
[23:11.08]Sorry, I was looking at that mountain.
[23:12.30]Alright, where's this going?
[23:23.60]Oh, I need the, yep, for the bridge.
[23:25.14]Yep.
[23:25.70]Go.
[23:26.24]Sick.
[23:53.06]Chicken wings?
[23:53.82]He's definitely high now.
[23:56.02]What does it want me to do?
[23:57.80]Oh, this, yeah.
[24:23.45]Check this out.
[24:25.71]Cool.
[24:30.63]This game listens to your microphone?
[24:33.21]I don't think it does.
[24:41.86]Everything is so beautiful.
[24:44.92]It actually is, though.
[24:46.68]Alright, I need two more.
[24:48.34]Alright.
[24:52.48]I remember this part.
[24:53.86]This part's cool.
[24:57.04]Watch this, Ernie.
[25:02.46]I gotta make a whole painting.
[25:03.24]Hold on.
[25:14.07]Future skies are bright.
[25:15.49]Is that it?
[25:23.40]A treasure in the making.
[25:24.44]Bro, that looks like shit.
[25:29.58]I made... Look, I connected.
[25:30.60]I connected these clouds, and then I put this up here.
[25:33.51]Where's the sun?
[25:34.35]Oh, oops.
[25:34.89]Can I have that back?
[25:59.50]It's like, why am I in a vacuum cleaner?
[26:06.21]It's just there for fun.
[26:07.13]It's not supposed to be... It doesn't matter.
[26:08.69]Okay, I need that.
[26:18.10]How do I get that one?
[26:27.35]Give me them both back.
[26:28.01]Okay.
[26:28.45]Wait, do I have to do it like this?
[26:34.53]Oh, shit.
[26:35.39]Okay.
[26:35.99]Um, I think I did it.
[26:45.20]Nice.
[26:53.54]Give me this painting.
[26:54.08]We're taking this over here.
[26:54.96]Oh, there's one more.
[27:03.75]I just got an achievement for dropping a battery off a level.
[27:05.77]I don't think I did that right.
[27:19.53]Yeah, you have to, like, carve it out.
[27:21.33]That's cool.
[27:21.77]Alright, what if I do this?
[27:22.59]How do I get in here?
[27:39.43]There it is.
[27:55.93]He loves this game.
[27:58.11]It's really cool.
[28:03.39]I don't know how many sleepless nights the coder was just sitting there looking at the code and just going, holy shit.
[28:16.99]I feel like after a certain point, I would just be looking at this and be sitting there going, okay, I'm a genius at some point, right?
[28:23.91]You have to give credit where credit is due.
[28:28.36]They need to take a lot of credit.
[28:29.52]Like, this is... Look at this.
[28:31.28]At some point, you have to sit there and look at all your code and go, holy shit.
[28:34.48]I did a great job.
[28:39.54]And you absolutely deserve to say that.
[28:46.14]I destroyed the teleporter?
[28:51.10]What did I do?
[28:51.64]Wait, what did I do?
[29:04.02]That just whoa.
[29:06.74]Oh God, oh my God, I'm gonna puke.
[29:09.78]What do I do?
[29:15.82]What the fuck is going on?
[29:21.25]Welcome back.
[29:22.97]A little too soon for my liking, but happy to have you.
[29:26.97]That was really weird.
[29:29.11]Way too dang, is it too loud?
[29:31.63]Seems like the simulation had some difficulty maintaining itself.
[29:34.86]We might need to reroute our power sources to keep it running.
[29:39.73]That's what we get for messing with all tech genius This tricky to get ancient tech back in working order alright People with trailblazers we could find a real tree of life in there Oh
[30:03.19]computer please load Star Trek the next generation engine room please I got pretty good oxygen
[30:25.80]Have you guys noticed?
[30:27.38]This is just something that I've observed.
[30:30.54]I've noticed that since COVID, a lot of these are still everywhere.
[30:37.87]And I keep trying to put my hand under them.
[30:41.05]And they don't do anything anymore.
[30:45.07]They just don't do anything anymore.
[30:47.94]I'll be like, oh, cool, hand sanitizer, let me try it.
[30:50.19]There's nothing there.
[30:51.21]Oh.
[30:52.31]Oh, shit, there's nothing in this.
[30:54.35]I think these have just been not filled for like a year.
[31:10.30]Is that bad, what I just did?
[31:12.66]And I get embarrassed every time.
[31:16.30]Uh, I, I don't... I, okay, I have absolutely been in a field of view going from one that didn't do anything to, oh, there's one over there, to the other one that doesn't do anything either.
[31:30.88]And then I kind of just put my hands together and go, like, clap, clap, like, okay.
[31:34.74]Um, I'm, I'm just gonna keep walking.
[31:38.68]I'm just gonna keep walking.
[31:46.63]Alright, let's go.
[31:47.79]It's too bright.
[31:48.31]These panels should be like gray.
[32:29.93]Hold on, let me see.
[32:32.69]Okay, but the public sanitizers smell like the cheapest vodka and have the consistency of saliva.
[32:45.52]That's, eh, that's kind of true.
[32:50.04]The foaming?
[32:51.16]Yeah, the foaming ones were awesome.
[32:59.79]If you had a foaming hand sanitizer, it was just like a little moose.
[33:04.16]Oh, it was perfect.
[33:05.14]That's all you needed.
[33:05.98]Okay, so do I go back to that other hub that I was just in?
[33:24.45]Because that was corrupted, right?
[33:30.07]Yeah, there we go.
[33:37.65]You're just like SpongeBob.
[33:40.88]SpongeBob is fucking awesome.
[33:43.20]Okay.
[33:46.00]SpongeBob is awesome.
[33:47.66]I'm being compared to who I would determine to be a literal god.
[33:50.32]Okay.
[33:50.56]Okay.
[33:59.01]I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, at the pearly gates, it's SpongeBob there.
[34:11.07]Okay, I might be overdoing this a little, but it's fun.
[34:15.04]Cool.
[34:20.70]Oh, I'm here!
[34:21.64]Oh, I just arrived at the gates!
[34:24.10]Oh, it's the gates of heaven!
[34:25.18]Oh!
[34:26.90]SpongeBob!
[34:28.90]Come over here.
[34:30.64]Okay, SpongeBob.
[34:31.42]I did a pretty good job.
[34:33.84]Did I make it into heaven?
[34:37.06]And he pulls a fucking lever and you drop straight to hell.
[34:41.78]No, you did not make it.
[34:52.57]That's a Family Guy bit.
[34:53.57]That's fine.
[34:54.55]I'll take it.
[34:59.20]Patrick.
[35:02.66]It's Roger from American Dad.
[35:04.87]Whatever.
[35:05.63]Roger from American Dad.
[35:08.03]They have the same kind of cadences.
[35:12.69]Roger from American Dad.
[35:14.17]It's Roger from... It's SpongeBob from American Dad.
[35:17.51]What do you want me to say?
[35:18.50]They kind of have the same cadences.
[35:23.93]Close your eyes.
[35:25.65]No, they don't.
[35:26.33]They kind of do.
[35:27.77]Is this payback for making you mix blue soul compositions all day?
[35:32.46]They're not even close.
[35:34.50]Have you ever known me to be the vengeful sort?
[35:47.74]Somebody said I just sounded like somebody from Hollywood Squares.
[35:53.95]Wait, what?
[35:54.51]Oh, look at that.
[36:09.64]Okay, this is the cool part.
[36:10.84]This is the part I like the most.
[36:17.48]I think these secrets.
[36:18.94]Yep.
[36:21.28]Are you?
[36:22.12]I found it now.
[36:24.16]This was a funny one.
[36:29.57]Not your usual style.
[36:31.37]You could say I was stretching my creative muscles.
[36:35.27]This is my favorite.
[36:46.30]Now what?
[36:51.01]Did I sit on my balls or something?
[36:52.95]Like, what did I do?
[36:58.69]Oh, shit.
[37:03.13]I remember this one.
[37:04.03]Okay, this is from the demo.
[37:06.12]This is what sealed that I was going to play this game.
[37:14.08]It was at this exact moment that I said, yeah, when this comes out, I'm going to play it.
[37:19.20]He'll say anything in his retirement.
[37:23.63]Whatever.
[37:30.02]Like, that's cool.
[37:48.07]Tony said, when did we enter the Nintendo DS?
[37:50.47]I was reminded of watching Joel's perspective during the house slipper stream.
[37:57.55]That's what I was thinking of.
[38:06.56]Cool.
[38:15.51]That was a lot of fun.
[38:16.33]Yeah.
[38:17.53]Already starting to think about when House Slipper 2 comes out.
[38:21.45]Already the gears are already turning on doing that again.
[38:25.58]So should be a lot of fun.
[38:26.72]Second time.
[38:36.50]Okay.
[38:36.87]This one has the battery right here.
[38:39.39]So that's easy.
[38:40.67]Get it.
[38:40.91]Bring it over here.
[38:45.54]Give them more time.
[38:47.34]Yeah, we learned a lot from that first one.
[38:50.66]So this second one is going to be... I think a little bit improved.
[38:56.66]Oh.
[38:56.92]I can't like... Put my face on this.
[39:18.83]I don't know if, like, there's another, like, funny, dumb meme.
[39:22.77]Then, like, you are gonna photocopy... Like, the photocopier joke, I think, still works.
[39:31.84]Even though people... That doesn't really exist anymore, right?
[39:34.78]But, like, I think that joke still makes sense.
[39:36.72]It still works.
[39:40.59]There's something inherently comical about like, oh, I'm going to put my face in this and squish my face down.
[39:45.57]To me, it's quantity.
[39:50.63]To me, it's like, okay, more than five to ten versions of like your smushed face.
[39:57.15]I don't know how dangerous that is.
[40:09.91]Alright, alright, alright.
[40:10.85]Everybody relax.
[40:11.61]Everybody relax.
[40:14.69]What do I need to photocopy?
[40:17.08]Oh, definitely this.
[40:30.09]Why did I photocopy too many?
[40:40.87]Whoa, look, it's all pixelated.
[40:50.32]Oh, guys, it's just like the sunflowers.
[40:53.10]Oh, that doesn't look right.
[41:10.44]Okay, so what am I actually supposed to do here?
[41:14.46]Wait, I know.
[41:15.20]Is that it?
[41:29.41]That's it, right?
[41:29.89]I have three.
[41:34.11]That's going to work, right?
[41:41.91]Yes!
[41:51.99]How did you like playing TF2 again?
[41:53.31]It was fun.
[41:57.22]I'm really surprised that that group, that MVM group, did as well as we did.
[42:03.82]We talked for about, I want to say,
[42:08.40]At least 15 minutes before the stream.
[42:10.98]Like, okay, it's going to be kind of hard.
[42:13.10]This is difficult.
[42:13.84]It's really not easy.
[42:15.98]We destroyed it.
[42:16.44]Dude, Ludwig was going hard.
[42:38.19]Alright, I need some brain power for this one.
[42:48.25]Oh, whoops.
[42:51.50]Should I just save?
[42:52.06]Wait, is there any more pictures over here?
[42:59.66]Oh, wait a minute.
[43:07.60]I'm going to use three because I don't know what exactly is going on here.
[43:14.08]But can I make this jump?
[43:26.21]Nope.
[43:33.44]Ah!
[43:33.58]Alright, do I need more than three?
[43:36.40]Uh, probably.
[43:36.88]Let me just get them all.
[43:51.86]Get the, get the duck.
[43:59.30]What duck?
[44:00.67]Oh, the, oh, this duck.
[44:04.80]I need two more ducks and I win.
[44:22.23]Should I read this as like I'm reading sorcery?
[44:43.98]Strictly speaking, the code we create is a technical Marvel, and designing these structures thrills me like nothing else.
[44:50.78]Should I reduce every character in Sorcery?
[44:54.76]But the novelty of it makes it too easy to forget what a real flower smells like.
[45:00.36]And I don't want to forget.
[45:04.38]Sorcery, coming soon.
[45:05.67]This coming weekend.
[45:09.03]One voice.
[45:16.25]Okay, I might have one voice, but I have one version of one voice.
[45:20.17]I have... Oh, fuck.
[45:21.33]Never mind.
[45:22.39]I'm retired.
[45:22.79]Who cares?
[45:25.98]Where do I go?
[45:37.06]Did I miss a picture?
[45:46.88]Oh, wait.
[45:47.54]Up on the roof maybe, right?
[46:03.35]There we go.
[46:13.47]Whoa, wait.
[46:16.16]Give that back.
[46:22.78]Oh, boy.
[46:23.24]Hold on.
[46:29.96]I need to get up there.
[46:30.70]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:34.51]I need to... Hold on.
[46:36.07]I need to build this first.
[46:39.09]I don't know.
[46:39.41]Maybe like...
[46:46.81]Did I make it from here?
[46:47.41]I think I got it.
[46:59.98]Yes!
[47:02.88]I could go higher.
[47:19.18]You ever play Gears of War?
[47:19.98]Oh, very briefly.
[47:24.94]Train just come in?
[47:32.72]Ooh.
[47:33.82]Is this open now?
[47:36.30]Teleport to optional challenge.
[47:39.72]Uh, okay.
[47:45.81]Can you recite the Gears of War lore?
[47:48.39]Mmm, I can try.
[47:51.28]What was the song in the commercial?
[47:53.82]It was like... And they were drilling down into the Earth.
[48:01.28]And they were all sitting in a pod, drilling down.
[48:03.42]And they were all sitting there.
[48:05.46]And it was just drilling down, down, down, down, down.
[48:07.20]And they had to go to the center of the Earth to fight the aliens or something.
[48:11.54]That's the only thing I know about the whole game.
[48:25.48]It was Mad World.
[48:27.04]Was it?
[48:31.18]It wasn't a rock song?
[48:36.72]It was Mad World.
[48:42.33]That kind of... Go listen to what I did.
[48:44.91]And imagine that this is something you haven't thought of in 10 plus years.
[48:53.72]That was kind of close for being a memory that I haven't thought of in a very long time.
[49:03.08]Alright, so this is an optional challenge.
[49:04.50]I don't know what it wants me to do, but let's find out.
[49:06.29]I'm going to put it right here.
[49:15.45]Years of War 2, the last day.
[49:24.19]This is it.
[49:24.59]This is not Mad World.
[49:34.24]This is it.
[49:34.80]This is the one.
[49:35.20]This is the right one.
[49:35.68]This is the right one.
[49:38.88]Yep.
[49:45.19]I told you.
[49:45.73]I told you I had it right.
[49:46.73]It wasn't Mad World.
[49:50.77]That's the one where they're sitting down and they're shaking in the pod and it's going down.
[49:56.00]That's the Gears of War 2 trailer.
[50:09.43]Oh, goodness.
[50:12.72]Why did I think that was going to work?
[50:15.52]Yeah, Gears of War 3 is Mad World.
[50:17.08]Alright, well, knowing that, that means I have to go like this.
[50:26.66]I'm smarter than the average man.
[50:34.92]About this.
[50:37.94]There a picture up there.
[50:39.16]Yeah, there is.
[50:39.60]Alright, I need to get obviously get up to that and I go from here.
[50:47.66]I did the.
[50:50.15]I do this.
[50:53.03]That no, not really.
[51:03.01]I need to get up there.
[51:12.08]It's a maze.
[51:12.88]I know what to do.
[51:14.48]I already won.
[51:15.10]I was going to say, I'll just look at it from above.
[51:36.54]Okay, now... Oh, shoot.
[51:49.60]Oh, creep.
[51:50.96]Can I pick a brick?
[52:03.36]You're cheating.
[52:05.81]There's no such thing as cheating in a game like this.
[52:07.61]It's called using different parts of your brain to solve different problems.
[52:14.35]Alright, this needs to be much closer.
[52:21.23]I have the right idea.
[52:27.88]This needs to be, like, over here.
[52:30.76]From the table.
[52:32.62]Up.
[52:33.48]Like...
[52:34.47]Like that.
[52:36.23]That should do it, right?
[52:36.95]Yes.
[52:40.57]Yes, it will.
[52:54.57]Dude, these mashed potatoes have been going a while.
[52:56.25]I'm getting worried.
[52:56.93]What?
[52:59.43]Are you just stirring mashed potatoes?
[53:08.87]Oh, wait, this doesn't seem right.
[53:11.59]This is not right.
[53:12.17]How?
[53:19.25]How do I?
[53:19.72]I need to rotate this.
[53:26.68]OK, but if I rewind, is that going to I'm going to lose all my am I going to lose progress if I rewind?
[53:32.72]Hold on.
[53:35.52]What is on this one?
[53:46.34]Did I... Oh.
[53:53.31]Oh, shit.
[53:54.37]Okay, wait, I... I... What?
[53:57.15]What the hell is happening?
[54:10.72]What's the goal?
[54:11.74]Is there like a... Is there a goal?
[54:13.46]I don't know what the goal is.
[54:23.74]I don't see a teleporter anywhere.
[54:33.16]Up there?
[54:34.70]Wait a minute.
[54:36.88]I don't get it.
[54:37.36]I missed a photo?
[54:52.86]Okay, how do I?
[54:54.26]Wait, hold on.
[54:55.14]I have an idea.
[55:00.36]Is that the one?
[55:01.78]Where's the one that I need to get?
[55:03.26]Right there.
[55:17.47]This is a challenge mode.
[55:18.55]This is not.
[55:22.63]Where do the stairs go?
[55:23.77]I actually think I might have gotten it.
[55:37.60]It's right there.
[55:42.73]Can I crouch?
[55:45.63]Shit, it's right here.
[55:46.77]Hold on, I'll get it.
[56:03.19]This is gonna make me puke.
[56:12.36]Wait, what's that?
[56:33.56]I got it.
[56:37.99]I actually just got it, I think.
[56:44.27]I can't climb these stairs.
[56:45.37]Why?
[56:47.98]What are you talking about?
[56:48.86]What?
[56:55.94]Get up the stairs.
[56:56.65]What?
[57:05.42]What was wrong with that?
[57:10.16]Jump backwards?
[57:10.73]Alright, this is an optional hard mode.
[57:17.07]Uh, that's fine.
[57:18.45]I'm gonna puke if I stay here for more than like 10 more minutes.
[57:29.36]Why can't I go up these stairs?
[57:39.21]Do it again.
[57:40.27]Okay.
[57:40.89]Just stop.
[57:41.47]Stop, stop, stop.
[57:43.27]Where do I need to go?
[57:44.23]Do I have to go up there?
[57:45.73]If I have to go up there... Then... I mean, I have to go this way.
[57:56.14]Which gives me this picture.
[58:01.30]Which then...
[58:09.55]Let's go over here.
[58:10.25]There's this photo and I need to get each one of these.
[58:13.67]So let me get this photo.
[58:14.55]Let me bring it back here.
[58:18.46]So what if I go like this now?
[58:19.94]I just want to see what happens.
[58:24.26]So if I get this, this brings me here.
[58:28.50]This gives me another one of these.
[58:38.62]which gives me another one of these, which gives me this, which then allows me to... I don't know.
[58:54.81]I mean, is this bait?
[58:57.05]This picture is bait.
[58:58.83]It has to be.
[59:03.19]What if I go like this and just keep picking up the same picture?
[59:09.73]Just over and over again.
[59:48.70]I just don't get it.
[59:49.60]Am I supposed to eventually make it up to the top of here?
[60:07.43]Does this do anything for me?
[60:09.97]No.
[60:26.14]Which photo is the teleporter in?
[60:27.32]I didn't... I thought... Okay.
[60:52.32]I thought that I was... Look, I didn't have the right context.
[60:56.86]I thought I was trying to get up on top of the other building because that's what I had to do in the last couple times.
[61:03.71]I only need one more duck and I can take a bath.
[61:05.69]Perfect.
[61:18.79]Alright, so that went over here.
[61:21.96]Ooh.
[61:26.54]I must admit, I'm surprised you made it this far.
[61:29.62]Cat!
[61:30.28]Pug!
[61:30.49]It's been a while since someone's wandered around this place.
[61:33.99]And it's good to have you.
[61:35.77]There's plenty of things to do here.
[61:37.77]Have you finished exploring?
[61:41.69]The train will take us to Horaiya Station.
[61:44.35]A place where science and art meet nature.
[61:47.11]Am I done with this section?
[61:47.89]I think I did everything.
[61:57.33]I don't think I'm missing anything.
[61:58.11]I think I got it all.
[62:06.27]You missed a duck.
[62:08.47]Ah.
[62:09.69]Yeah.
[62:11.90]Please, man, I don't have time.
[62:12.70]I need your skincare routine.
[62:14.60]Um.
[62:24.18]Use a gentle cleanser on your face.
[62:26.18]Do this in the shower.
[62:28.38]And use a decent moisturizer a few minutes after you get out of the shower after drying your face.
[62:35.42]That's it.
[62:35.78]That's it.
[62:37.10]Moisturize it.
[62:39.98]Moisturize your neck too.
[62:40.90]People forget to do that.
[62:43.74]I'm not talking about putting a glob in your hand.
[62:45.78]It's like a little pinky amount.
[62:48.42]Just get it on your cheeks, forehead, chin, tip of the nose.
[62:52.64]Work it in.
[62:53.34]Easy.
[62:53.46]This is pretty.
[63:12.29]Wow, is that a tree?
[63:16.80]This must be the next set.
[63:19.84]Maybe we'll find out more about the work being done in this area.
[63:23.66]Let's go.
[63:33.49]What was that?
[63:48.69]Ooh, whoa, hold on.
[63:52.41]I'll never take the art of walking into your work for granted.
[63:59.39]I have to make the picture with my face.
[64:02.87]There it is.
[64:03.43]Okay, I'm ready to go in.
[64:24.90]What?
[64:25.32]No, that wasn't the Tasmanian devil.
[64:28.20]That wasn't an orc.
[64:29.04]That was me puking.
[64:31.27]You think I was doing like an orc rage charge?
[64:35.03]That is not what that was.
[64:36.87]That was I just puked because that was weird.
[64:41.97]Whoa, hold on.
[64:43.52]Hold on, let me do it again.
[64:46.26]That's good.
[64:47.78]Sorry, the simulation is really long on my end.
[64:50.04]Hold on.
[64:55.61]Oh, it's so stupid.
[64:56.69]Okay.
[65:01.68]And there's the teleporter.
[65:10.13]I think I have to be... I gotta look down.
[65:12.07]I gotta get up there.
[65:26.07]pet the cat I like that this is okay I'm gonna like these levels these are fun they're gonna get even harder and it's gonna be more fun to do that hello you do it I'm not doing it uh it's me I don't know how it happened but somehow I lost direct communication with you live comms don't seem to be working where you are
[65:52.81]Plants.
[65:53.17]Bring these to the planning session.
[66:26.96]What?
[66:29.18]Oh, I get it.
[66:37.61]Whoa, cool.
[66:38.63]Get out of the way.
[66:42.47]I'm having fun.
[66:43.37]There's no crouching either.
[66:48.97]Shit.
[66:49.25]Okay, I have to... Uh...
[66:59.86]This needs to go... Alright, I need to take this out.
[67:03.68]Here's what I need to do.
[67:05.32]Check this out.
[67:08.02]There we go.
[67:16.02]Now I have enough space to put my back against this wall.
[67:22.07]Get it right there.
[67:24.77]Yeah!
[67:27.42]Will we listen to the, uh, Omegafon?
[67:29.92]I just cut that off, but it's okay.
[67:33.12]Alright.
[67:33.40]I'm gonna have to line up, like, three pictures here.
[67:36.44]Oh, oh, I, I, I've seen a Disney World documentary about this.
[67:41.34]Okay, uh...
[68:05.67]Is there another lever?
[68:11.38]I need a painting for sure.
[68:19.88]Alright.
[68:20.30]Breathtaking.
[68:20.91]Paint me next.
[68:21.75]Always a pleasure to watch a master at work.
[68:24.21]Thought-provoking.
[68:24.91]Go.
[68:27.13]Is there a painting?
[68:32.55]Cool.
[68:33.87]How to use our screen printing in mural successes.
[68:37.99]Mural orchids.
[68:40.39]Urine.
[68:40.87]Dream big but remain practical.
[68:42.75]Strawberries.
[68:45.21]Strawberries are pretty good.
[68:56.48]Something I've been noticing.
[68:58.98]This is a... That's going to make me throw up looking at that.
[69:02.10]Alright.
[69:03.48]My graphics card, when the fan turns on now, kind of goes like this.
[69:11.79]I think I'm going to have to replace it.
[69:23.81]Oh, cool.
[69:33.87]But it's not that the fan's loud.
[69:35.45]It's making a different noise.
[69:38.67]Did you... Okay, when it would... When the fan would boot up.
[69:41.88]We all know.
[69:42.36]You go... That's fine.
[69:45.40]The pitch has changed.
[69:47.38]Instead of... It goes... So what does a pitch change mean?
[70:00.57]Bearings might be cooked.
[70:03.63]It's not dirty.
[70:05.03]I usually dust it out.
[70:19.24]Does it change when the FPS changes?
[70:22.27]It's only when I think it starts to heat up a little.
[70:25.49]It's going to do a sick drift.
[70:36.61]stare at a wall no it doesn't I know I know what you're talking about where if you look at a certain thing or if a certain thing gets rendered it's like yeah I know I've heard that I know that this is the fan kicking on yeah this is more like a fan sound but okay let's see use camera
[71:11.98]Okay, can I turn this?
[71:12.90]Um, should I like... Does that help me at all?
[71:30.53]I'm assuming probably no, but I'm gonna just see what happens.
[71:36.79]No, I can rotate the photo.
[71:38.29]What am I doing?
[71:42.50]Uh, let me take a look around first.
[72:06.02]Be sure to catch my good side, alright?
[72:09.76]Why would you need two photos?
[72:11.76]If it's just right here.
[72:14.64]Have you had coffee yet?
[72:19.12]Yeah.
[72:20.40]I'm just chilling.
[72:22.96]Alright, two batteries.
[72:30.72]There are four photos I can take here.
[72:34.66]Just take them, right?
[72:37.00]Let's just see.
[72:43.36]What's the cat's name?
[72:44.78]I don't know.
[72:47.20]Battery right there.
[72:50.16]Let's go like this.
[73:05.32]Name the cat.
[73:14.75]Um, I don't know.
[73:16.74]Joey.
[73:24.30]It has a name.
[73:25.08]It's Kate.
[73:28.39]That's right.
[73:29.43]Yeah, I was not paying attention.
[73:32.05]I was.
[73:33.01]Half my brain was.
[73:34.63]And then it just buried it somewhere.
[73:35.61]Alright, one more.
[73:38.34]Where...
[73:43.97]Probably up there.
[73:49.73]I feel like too long, but I have a solution to this.
[73:55.26]This mess of my own making.
[73:58.70]You must know what Mira has been working on.
[74:01.90]Squirreled away in her own little corner.
[74:04.67]I thought it was ducks.
[74:05.71]Maybe I can find a way to help.
[74:07.97]That might put us back on good terms.
[74:11.65]Oh, I just got rid of it.
[74:13.13]Oh, I think I just got rid of it.
[74:15.47]Hold on.
[74:15.85]Sorry.
[74:16.13]Alright, I'm going to go back here.
[74:17.65]What's this other battery?
[74:51.06]Oh shit, there it is.
[74:53.47]It's right there.
[74:54.61]Is that it?
[75:04.81]Is that not it?
[75:14.81]I want a good bird's eye view.
[75:16.53]Okay, where is it?
[75:53.10]Is it... I don't know.
[76:01.74]It's not up there.
[76:02.32]Okay, so... Is this one right here?
[76:24.57]Where is the other battery?
[76:29.22]I would imagine it would be around the corner right here, but no.
[76:31.70]Or up top on one of these, but it's not.
[76:33.86]Where's the other battery?
[76:46.13]I have an idea.
[76:50.97]Oh, I know what to do.
[76:51.69]I know what to do.
[77:12.25]There we go.
[77:18.25]Nope.
[77:18.81]Oh.
[77:28.52]I figured it out.
[77:29.26]I got it.
[77:29.56]I got it.
[77:29.82]I got it.
[77:30.10]Everybody, everybody chill.
[77:31.39]Everybody chill.
[77:45.44]How do you feel when all your fans can immediately know that you are high?
[77:48.98]Well, you're not very good at it because I'm not.
[77:50.74]No, I told you, since the analog clock incident, I have not been able to do that.
[78:11.93]No, I said I'm never doing that ever again since the analog clock incident.
[78:20.52]Not that I mind the company.
[78:23.80]On the contrary, really.
[78:26.62]I find you to be quite adventurous.
[78:28.66]And fun.
[78:35.40]You also invented the analog clock thing was a lie to save face.
[78:39.49]Yeah, but that was a lie.
[78:48.61]No, no, no, no.
[78:50.51]The cement level in Hitman was the lie to save face.
[78:55.77]You're mixing it up, but we have to make sure we get the record straight.
[78:59.69]The cement level in Hitman 3 was the lie to save face.
[79:04.84]Come on.
[79:05.41]You gotta get it right.
[79:07.90]What is this?
[79:18.25]Yeah, I think I distinctly remember looking over at chat and being like, oh my God, dude, no, no way.
[79:24.04]Like, is he alright?
[79:24.78]What's he doing?
[79:25.46]And I was like, what am I doing?
[79:26.96]I don't know.
[79:28.10]Uh, yeah, that edible must've just kicked in.
[79:29.92]Everyone's like, oh, right.
[79:32.10]Of course.
[79:32.86]I was like, I have to say that.
[79:35.51]Otherwise I look stupid.
[79:47.95]You already made this joke?
[79:49.05]Yeah, but you know, sometimes we recycle content.
[79:54.71]I play them.
[79:56.61]Oh, I do play it.
[79:57.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[79:57.83]This would be really far away, doesn't it?
[79:59.09]Okay.
[80:18.96]It's working.
[80:31.43]Read that clock right now.
[80:33.77]That clock is at exactly 3 p.m.
[80:38.89]I'm not sure about a.m.
[80:40.49]or p.m.
[80:40.89]That is 3 p.m.
[80:44.24]I said it after.
[80:46.67]I said it after.
[80:47.41]I said it after.
[80:48.09]I said it after.
[80:48.93]It happened after.
[81:15.23]What an accomplishment.
[81:45.44]I went out there and did this to the sunflowers.
[81:46.86]I went out there and was singing to them.
[81:50.04]And I got stung by a bee.
[81:54.33]I was like... I'm lying.
[81:58.85]I'm fucking around.
[81:59.53]It didn't happen.
[82:03.52]No!
[82:03.72]No!
[82:30.99]He killed it?
[82:31.59]No, you don't play music to make a plant grow.
[82:48.08]I do this shit in real life, alright?
[82:49.96]I know how to take care of a goddamn plant.
[83:05.30]Have you seen my blooms?
[83:06.64]Have you seen my blooms?
[83:08.33]Have you seen my blooms?
[83:09.61]Then I don't want to hear it.
[83:46.22]You killed it again.
[83:47.00]It's not dead.
[83:48.09]Yeah, when you don't even get your fucking hands dirty, you don't press a button on a computer screen, alright?
[83:58.29]And this is inaccurate.
[84:14.34]I wonder what I have to do this for
[85:03.24]Hey.
[85:04.70]What do you have to say now?
[85:16.45]And it's a sunflower, too.
[85:17.41]My favorite.
[85:17.97]Alright, is this done?
[85:23.27]I got a bee.
[85:26.36]I got an achievement for that.
[85:27.14]Wait.
[85:27.30]Uh-oh.
[85:33.81]Oh, that's not good.
[85:37.80]I think I was supposed to take a picture of this.
[85:43.34]Oh shit, it's gonna sting me!
[85:51.51]Oh, okay, cool.
[85:52.17]I won.
[86:07.56]Uh, cool.
[86:08.36]Okay.
[86:08.60]That was fun.
[86:09.13]Uh, now what?
[86:09.65]Is this stupid what I'm doing?
[87:01.58]How do I?
[87:07.03]I have to take a picture of this.
[87:08.27]Can I move the camera?
[87:14.68]Oh.
[87:17.36]Okay.
[87:17.82]Well, that changes everything.
[87:18.96]Uh, aha!
[87:33.48]Now.
[87:34.18]Uh, yeah.
[87:36.00]Yeah.
[87:39.72]Yeah.

[89:01.07]Well, whatever.

[89:15.51]Plenty of records read.
[89:18.39]Hi.
[89:19.79]Now is that those actually like shark or fish heads?
[89:22.39]Or is that like a cake or something to make it look like ice cream or something?
[89:25.92]I don't know.
[89:37.22]We got here.
[89:39.22]Dried mangoes?
[89:40.14]That sounds actually kind of good.
[89:43.98]Alright, two batteries.
[89:50.37]You got it.
[89:55.13]Is there going to be a camera somewhere, right?
[89:59.82]Don't do anything yet.
[90:21.15]That fix it will land now on this.
[90:28.83]Wow.
[90:29.59]Get this man some prunes.
[90:30.95]It's improved you.
[90:50.52]Done deal.
[90:54.07]Another telephone.
[90:55.01]Simulation is a maze.
[90:56.25]Alright, this is going to be a hard one.
[90:58.03]Find the machine.
[91:21.92]You got it, Doey.
[91:25.68]Alright, this is going to spawn that, which, that's fine.
[91:42.35]Keep that there.
[91:42.77]Take a picture of it, and that's it.
[91:51.48]wasn't too bad one two
[92:23.09]Oh, shit.
[92:31.47]I ran the cord over.
[92:40.01]Oh, I really, really ran the cord over.
[92:45.82]So... Okay.
[92:48.62]I get it.
[92:48.92]I get it.
[92:49.20]I know what to do.
[92:50.20]Just watch.
[92:50.66]I know exactly what to do.
[92:51.82]Watch this.
[92:55.08]That's fine.
[92:55.46]I can stay like that.
[92:56.66]I didn't even need to- I had it.
[92:57.64]I didn't even need- I didn't even need to do that.
[92:59.04]I didn't even need to do that.
[92:59.98]That was- I got it.
[93:00.88]I got it.
[93:01.08]I got it.
[93:01.30]I got it.
[93:01.52]I got it.
[93:01.72]I got it.
[93:01.90]I know what to do.
[93:02.32]Just watch.
[93:04.66]Watch this.
[93:09.37]I did it backwards.
[93:10.45]Wait.
[93:10.85]Wait.
[93:11.15]Everybody just- I know what to do.
[93:12.53]I'm just doing it in the wrong order.
[93:14.87]Okay.
[93:15.17]Just get me in here.
[93:15.81]Start over.
[93:16.23]Watch.
[93:18.07]I need to take a picture of this while it is intact.
[93:27.74]There we go.
[93:32.42]And then now it doesn't matter.
[93:35.57]I got it.
[93:36.01]Yeah, that was a tricky one, but it's fun.
[93:43.39]Now, oh, but hold on.
[93:44.99]This is where it gets a little weird.
[93:49.25]OK, hold on.
[93:53.68]OK, wait.
[93:58.19]Take another picture.
[94:21.39]Now.
[94:23.17]Here we go.
[94:31.60]You had to take one before and then one after.
[94:43.55]Oh, okay, I beat it.
[94:44.95]This is the optional challenge now.
[94:49.71]These are going to get progressively harder and harder, and I'm going to tell you, I don't think I'm going to do all the optional challenges.
[94:54.54]I'm going to try them for five minutes each.
[94:57.04]Start the timer.
[94:58.12]Starting now.
[95:10.29]Complete them, you wimp.
[95:13.65]They're hard.
[95:14.33]Alright.
[95:15.47]So what's going on here?
[95:20.19]I was gonna take a picture of it because I don't know.
[95:24.87]I imagine I could probably use this as a platform to jump on.
[95:31.07]What's the goal?
[95:31.49]Let's find the goal.
[95:33.87]The goal is to flip this thing sideways.
[95:42.93]But... I got it.
[96:00.06]I've already got it.
[96:00.94]You better start betting because I got it right now.
[96:03.92]You better bet correctly because I just beat it.
[96:07.16]You got 10 seconds to get the bet right because I just did it.
[96:31.61]I know what I gotta do, but I don't know how to get up there.
[96:35.95]Wait.
[96:38.18]Hold on.
[96:42.82]Check this out.
[96:43.44]Watch this.
[96:45.12]What's the lowest point?
[96:51.04]I need to see where it is.
[96:52.54]It is... Which side is it on?
[96:53.76]Alright, it's on this side.
[96:56.37]So it's like...
[97:02.47]I know what I have to do.
[97:04.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:05.55]I got it.
[97:05.85]I already got it.
[97:06.29]I know what to do.
[97:14.43]Come on.
[97:14.93]I got it.
[97:15.23]Is that it?
[97:17.14]Fuck.
[97:22.90]You know I'm going to get it right now.
[97:32.80]It's so close.
[97:42.20]Got it.
[97:44.02]Oh, sorry, doubters.
[97:45.20]You just absolutely got destroyed right there.
[97:47.83]I mean, just decimated.
[97:50.31]I kind of feel bad for the doubters, don't you?
[97:58.99]I kind of feel bad for the doubters.
[98:00.75]The first time ever.
[98:04.44]Usually I'm internally swearing at them, but not right now.
[98:07.00]I got that one.
[98:11.14]I caught that one.
[98:11.78]I caught on pretty quickly on that one.
[98:13.60]Oh, hold on.
[98:14.84]Okay, there we go.
[98:36.81]Okay, the points don't matter since he's retired.
[98:38.97]I always believed in you.
[98:45.36]Well, thank you.
[98:57.92]Really important, Jerma.
[98:58.62]What is your sleep positioning?
[99:00.90]I am a side sleeper.
[99:04.16]Usually.
[99:08.05]Usually.
[99:08.35]I, I got the, usually I'm, I'm on my right side, and I've got, uh, a good, a good pillow to support my arm and shoulder.
[99:21.46]Like, my arm and forearm and, like, right at the bicep meeting the forearm area is under the pillow, and I'm kind of propped up right side lying that way.
[99:30.87]My legs are sort of down on the, you know, you know what I mean.
[99:37.30]I feel like most people sleep like that.
[99:39.54]It's probably a majority.
[99:42.60]Filter select.
[99:48.92]You sleep hanging from the ceiling like a bat.
[99:54.89]That would be really weird.
[100:07.09]What does this say?
[100:08.95]Information?
[100:15.29]Dude, you guys have no idea.
[100:22.21]It's going to be... Okay, I'm going to commit to one bit this year.
[100:26.60]And it's going to be a good one.
[100:31.42]I promise.
[100:36.14]It's not a big bit.
[100:37.50]It's just a small bit, but I'm going to commit to it.
[100:44.27]Holly and I were laughing a lot about this, and it's... It has to be done.
[100:52.51]It must be done.
[100:54.39]Where's the level?
[100:59.65]They're all staticky.
[101:06.64]Don't say.
[101:07.18]I won't say.
[101:07.62]I won't say.
[101:08.12]Will it be on YouTube?
[101:13.24]No, it'll be stream.
[101:16.06]Probably just easier that way.
[101:17.30]How do I unlock these?
[101:30.06]Excuse me.
[101:35.45]Is there higher up that I didn't see?
[101:42.24]It's going to be really hard not to laugh, but I will go into actor mode and I promise you I will see the bit through.
[101:56.75]By the train.
[101:57.33]Right in front of the train.
[102:09.05]Oh, okay.
[102:10.51]Well.
[102:16.20]Ooh.
[102:17.88]I love the teal.
[102:19.46]It's my favorite color.
[102:23.71]Did you guess?
[102:26.29]My entire channel is based around, like, these three colors.
[102:37.19]Do you hear that?
[102:40.01]In my memories, I hear singing and laughing.
[102:45.13]Another one of these.
[102:46.43]All the levers.
[102:46.93]What are we looking for?
[102:47.53]Alright, mountain.
[102:51.28]Shall we go take a look?
[102:56.12]Watch this.
[102:59.64]I was hoping I could just do a weird hop around it.
[103:01.44]I probably can.
[103:10.19]That's pretty close.
[103:11.31]It's definitely doable.
[103:19.71]Someone else will do it.
[103:20.87]I know you will.
[103:27.73]Don't hold W while you air strafe.
[103:31.65]I feel like that was screamed at me so many times over the years.
[103:35.87]And I just never was able to not do it.
[103:38.81]Just always press W.
[103:51.48]You're just so conditioned to be holding the move forward button.
[103:55.72]Oh, okay.
[104:09.11]I don't see a picture anywhere.
[104:18.80]I'm a dumb animal.
[104:19.76]If I can let go of W, you can too.
[104:40.64]I'm not even sure that's a possible physics ability you can even do in this game.
[104:45.58]I did let go of W though, I promise.
[104:46.84]Okay, well there's the teleporter.
[104:53.87]Hey, look at that.
[105:11.92]Airstrafe is a source thing.
[105:14.12]Yeah.
[105:19.30]Alright, so very clearly I... Oh.
[105:22.75]I thought I had to get four.
[105:24.37]One, two, three.
[105:26.27]Oh.
[105:33.58]Thanks.
[105:34.34]Okay.
[105:37.31]Ooh, cake.
[105:43.42]I don't like cake.
[105:53.70]Can we get a poll?
[105:58.66]I actually, and please answer honestly.
[106:00.40]I know sometimes people mess around here, but
[106:03.60]Standard cake.
[106:06.18]A standard birthday cake.
[106:08.60]No, not ice cream cake.
[106:10.16]Not tiramisu.
[106:11.69]Just a cake.
[106:14.73]Just a regular cake.
[106:17.45]Do you rate that higher than a C plus?
[106:22.69]Is standard cake higher than a C plus?
[106:26.05]Yes or no?
[106:27.42]Because I am somebody that says no.
[106:39.50]I'm very curious where everybody stands on this, honestly.
[106:49.29]It's a very standard C. That's what I mean.
[106:53.37]I do wonder how many people see cake as higher than C+.
[106:57.99]I feel like it's probably a lot of people.
[107:09.00]I thought that was a burger.
[107:12.26]Okay, so I'm gonna guess that I have to take a picture of this with the poster.
[107:36.33]I found it.
[107:37.27]Oh, a camera portable and with instant film to boot.
[107:42.17]A smart way to travel around here and a powerful way to store data.
[107:46.58]I can't wait to see how you use this.
[107:49.40]I use it myself.
[107:52.20]58% higher than a C plus.
[107:53.52]Wow.
[107:57.46]That's actually really surprising.
[108:01.88]Okay.
[108:15.35]I would say it's a C+.
[108:17.17]Maybe a C. But some cake is terrible.
[108:24.61]I have never, okay, ice cream is always going to be an A. Because even like bad ice cream, it's ice cream.
[108:33.10]It's just, it doesn't matter what ice cream it is.
[108:34.70]It's going to be fine.
[108:35.36]It's like, okay, what are my options at the dessert?
[108:38.34]It's cake is, okay, there's vanilla ice cream on the table over there.
[108:42.50]There's cookies.
[108:43.21]That ice cream is always going to be perfect.
[108:45.45]I'm always going to be okay with that.
[108:47.43]But I've had a lot of cakes before that were bad.
[108:49.29]They were way less than a C.
[108:53.82]Grayscale.
[108:56.62]Cold.
[108:57.54]Warm.
[108:59.76]Whoa, this is really weird.
[109:01.54]I'm going to do this for one second.
[109:07.25]Game Boy.
[109:07.65]Did I even activate it?
[109:21.38]What are these bad cakes?
[109:23.16]Dry as heck.
[109:26.54]I have eaten cakes before that were super moist.
[109:28.64]Okay, this is higher than a C+.
[109:29.80]This is alright.
[109:30.76]This might be close.
[109:32.32]But I've had cake before that... I feel like I'm eating sawdust.
[109:46.61]Oh.
[109:47.91]Alright, I kind of don't want to do this anymore.
[109:54.04]Do you know what I mean?
[109:54.60]I don't know if I like this filter.
[109:56.91]Now I understand what it was for.
[110:02.81]I can't even read the instructions.
[110:09.32]Yeah, we are going to change this.
[110:25.69]What is better on average?
[110:27.20]What were the other options?
[110:28.58]Cake over pie?
[110:29.38]Huh?
[110:33.48]Cake over pie?
[110:36.60]What are you talking about?
[110:37.90]No.
[110:43.27]No way.
[110:44.77]Over like a banana cream pie?
[110:46.85]Or a chocolate cream pie?
[110:49.07]I thought that... I thought that apple pie... I thought you guys were apple pie andies.
[110:59.61]I can't even look at that.
[111:22.06]Apple pie.
[111:22.52]I don't even like apple pie.
[111:24.14]Uh-oh.
[111:26.86]A lot of people just heard that for the first time, I think.
[111:34.63]A lot of people may have just heard that for the first time.
[111:36.59]I want them to be closer.
[111:40.13]Okay, well, did I just do it?
[111:47.46]I just beat it.
[111:49.50]Oh.
[111:53.40]Okay, let me explain.
[111:54.78]Let me explain.
[111:55.24]I've been waiting for you.
[111:57.31]Everybody that's saying, what the fuck?
[112:00.27]If apple pie just had the sludge in it and not the apple pieces, the apple slices.
[112:09.01]If it was just the pie crust, the sludge filling and no apple slices, I would love it.
[112:18.38]You take the apple slices out and it's probably going to be one of my favorite pies.
[112:25.75]That's fucked up.
[112:27.51]That's fine, but that sweet apple flavor is great.
[112:32.13]I just don't like the warm, hot, slimy, slippery, like, apple.
[112:37.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[112:38.44]It's just that I don't like it.
[112:39.56]It's not the only reason you killed her.
[112:55.34]I'm getting achievements for doing this.
[113:07.32]No bully.
[113:15.75]NA has the worst cuisine.
[113:20.03]What does that have- That has nothing to do with- I'm sorry, but banana cre- Where's banana- Where did banana cream pie originate from?
[113:25.65]Because American desserts- Hold on.
[113:30.51]Hold the phone for a second.
[113:32.76]American desserts are ridiculous.
[113:41.74]Where did banana cream- Who made the first banana cream pie?
[113:44.48]Coconut cream pie?
[113:45.58]Are you serious?
[113:48.72]What about donuts?
[113:49.72]Who made the first donut?
[113:50.80]Eh, it's probably like Jerma or something.
[113:55.10]Banana cream pie though, where did it come from?
[113:56.54]Look it up.
[113:57.28]Pecan pie, look it up.
[114:01.67]Ah, excuse me.
[114:02.41]Cotton candy ice cream?
[114:03.91]Look it up.
[114:06.95]I'm just kidding.
[114:09.95]American desserts suck.
[114:11.26]No, they don't.
[114:12.28]It's like one of the things that Americans make that are very good.
[114:28.37]Americans make fantastic desserts.
[114:37.43]Barbecue?
[114:38.53]Yeah, excuse me.
[114:40.11]I don't want to hear that.
[114:41.24]Look, I know, like, Americans... I got a nice smoked brisket.
[114:47.76]Come on, Gwyn.
[114:51.20]I do not want to hear that.
[115:00.22]Do Oreos count?
[115:06.23]I want to say yes, but I can't because weren't they something else like a long time?
[115:15.87]Wasn't there like a whole thing about Oreos and what are they called?
[115:20.30]Hydrox, is there something?
[115:25.90]Was Hydrox American?
[115:27.14]I think it was.
[115:30.54]But do other countries have cereals with mascots?
[115:33.13]Checkmate.
[115:33.73]That's right.
[115:38.59]Yeah, sorry.
[115:39.75]Tony the Tiger.
[115:42.10]Tony the Tiger is American, okay?
[115:48.31]Yeah, they do.
[115:49.21]Yeah, they do.
[115:49.67]Oh, alright.
[115:51.35]You want to have a cage match between Tony the Tiger, Count Chocula, and that fucking wacky Cocoa Puffs bird against whatever the fuck you're going to bring to the table?
[116:01.15]What's going to get in there in the cage match?
[116:10.92]Wait, were they fighting?
[116:12.34]I forget.
[116:12.70]I think they were fighting, weren't they?
[116:21.40]I don't know, I've never really thought that much about cereal mascots.
[116:24.24]He's patriotic for cereal.
[116:33.97]Of course I am, because they're great!
[116:48.62]I'm available.
[116:51.92]Alright, what am I doing?
[116:59.15]Yeah, Captain Crunch.
[117:02.89]You go, yeah, my cereal mascot from, I don't know, wherever.
[117:06.86]From England.
[117:08.70]My cereal mascot will beat your cereal mascot's ass.
[117:12.24]Oh, yeah?
[117:14.44]Captain Crunch will launch a fucking Crunch Berry Cannonball out of his ship at you.
[117:19.07]Alright?
[117:21.70]You want to sail the seas against Cap'n Crunch?
[117:23.81]Bring it.
[117:26.11]Why do I care about this?
[117:27.07]Alright.
[117:27.77]I need to play the game.
[117:38.15]Play the game.
[117:39.05]Nobody cares.
[117:39.95]Oh, I think a lot of people care.
[117:42.09]Judging by the amount of scathing reviews I'm getting.
[117:48.12]Alright, so, uh...
[117:52.63]I gotta get that.
[117:56.37]Let's get a picture of that first.
[118:07.74]Well, that was way easier than I was making it.
[118:12.72]You still eat Oreos?
[118:15.53]I'd say maybe sometimes.
[118:21.21]Whoa, what's this?
[118:24.98]That's kind of cool.
[118:27.60]What about the Honey Nut Cheerios Bee?
[118:33.52]What's your number one snack right now?
[118:38.52]I don't know if I could say.
[118:39.34]It really does vary depending on the mood.
[118:41.88]Can I play this?
[119:00.45]uh honestly if you want the real answer it's probably hummus I could eat hummus all day every single day and I probably have always the one of the first things I get at the grocery store my biscuit I love it so much it's like the best thing in the world what sort of accusation is that you did didn't you I can always ask kate you know oh right so what if I did I was just sitting there going uneaten it's not as if it could have gone cold
[119:29.09]Hummus with a little bit of bread.
[119:32.47]Eat it up tortilla.
[119:35.75]Non-bread.
[119:38.41]Chickpeas are so good.
[119:40.99]What am I supposed to... Am I supposed to go in?
[119:43.90]Wait.
[119:44.66]I'm not actually supposed to walk... I am.
[119:46.40]Okay, hold on.
[119:48.44]Wait a minute.
[119:54.64]Wait, this is really cool.
[119:56.04]Hold on.
[119:56.96]I gotta jump down on it.
[120:07.81]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[120:15.32]Oh, that makes so much sense.
[120:21.80]Come on, get in there!
[120:30.51]Shit!
[120:39.91]It's something like that, right?
[120:48.02]Oh, wait, what's this?
[120:51.10]Am I overthinking this like crazy or what?
[120:55.38]I'm overthinking this one.
[120:58.86]Okay.
[121:02.71]Um...
[121:10.03]Oh, I get it.
[121:10.95]I fall into it.
[121:11.61]I get it.
[121:12.07]I get it.
[121:45.94]I don't get it.
[121:53.32]What am I trying to do here?
[122:15.93]Oh my god.
[122:19.45]What was the... Why was this cool thing here?
[122:22.91]What?
[122:26.89]Is this just a cool thing?
[122:31.52]Well, okay.
[122:42.62]Alright, where's the batteries?
[122:49.91]I did this one in the demo.
[122:51.59]So, I should get it pretty quickly.
[122:53.01]It's two, right?
[123:05.54]Yep.
[123:06.08]Okay, and then I need to take a picture of this.
[123:07.46]And put it this way.
[123:10.92]Because then... I pre-played this level.
[123:17.86]I did it in the demo.
[123:33.61]What about on this table?
[123:34.41]Something to pick up?
[123:43.84]Change the filter?
[123:44.54]Yeah, I have to wait till the next level.
[123:48.86]I could have done it, like dropped out, but I would have probably had to do all these levels.
[123:51.99]What is that?
[123:55.93]This is Tetris.
[123:57.61]Does it actually play?
[124:01.63]Oh yeah, it definitely does.
[124:03.95]Alright, so how do I do this?
[124:09.02]No.
[124:29.94]Dude, alright, I can get this.
[124:32.13]Wait a second.
[124:32.79]Can I?
[124:45.42]Maybe not.
[125:06.83]All of it was gone.
[125:07.87]Whatever.
[125:09.25]This is cool, but somebody else can figure this out.
[125:11.44]It's a fun little thing.
[125:12.38]What's this one?
[125:26.43]I'm right here.
[125:27.11]Give it to me.
[125:38.43]Holy shit.
[125:48.00]Can I go all the way up?
[126:08.23]Alright, I did it.
[126:08.81]That's fun.
[126:16.29]Those will stack infinitely.
[126:19.57]Wait, they will?
[126:37.86]I found something else fun to do.
[126:39.06]Hold on.
[126:39.32]I don't care about the level right now.
[126:50.68]I just want to do five of those.
[126:57.11]Where was that thing?
[126:58.09]Yeah, I'm going to get a picture of three or four at the same time.
[127:03.37]So technically, if I go like this...
[127:11.53]And then like that.
[127:31.62]Uh.
[127:57.35]Just gotta get one and I'm good.
[128:20.93]Oh.
[128:28.00]alright I gotta take my time I don't even care about the teleporter no no go back cause I can let's go like this that's better
[129:02.00]Oh goodness.
[129:16.17]This guy sucks.
[129:17.83]No, it's kind of hard to get these.
[129:20.25]Oh my god.
[129:43.97]Uh-oh.
[129:53.99]No!
[129:58.74]Go... Wait.
[130:02.34]Okay.
[130:02.44]Okay.
[130:21.02]Oh, fuck off.
[130:22.26]Shit.
[131:16.60]I want to restart because I have a better idea.
[131:19.42]I'm going to put them closer together.
[131:22.44]I want to get them all.
[131:26.62]This is going to be so stupid, but I don't care.
[131:28.16]It's fun.
[131:29.76]Alright, so here's the plan.
[131:32.83]Plan is put this in a spot where I can get to it easily, like down.
[131:37.77]OK, here we go.
[131:42.77]Now.
[132:31.84]Okay.
[132:34.46]I'm not stuck.
[132:35.30]I'm doing something weird.
[132:36.14]No, no, no, no.
[133:14.75]God damn it!
[133:16.23]No!
[133:38.98]Oh, yup.
[133:39.65]Here it is.
[134:04.65]Oh, absolutely perfect.
[134:06.89]Now I can fall down and get these stones.
[134:08.33]Do it like an idiot.
[134:11.53]I lucked out so bad right there.
[134:19.56]Okay, it's time.
[134:20.70]I got them all.
[134:41.12]Stop doing that.
[134:41.96]I have to go straight up.
[134:42.98]I need to break the fucking video game.
[134:50.69]This is it right here.
[134:52.97]Here we go.
[134:57.03]Oop!
[135:24.45]Shit, hold on.
[135:27.71]I have to air strafe wayyyy sooner.
[135:34.43]Let's go.
[135:43.61]Yeah! Bwah! Bwah-haaaaa!
[135:49.61]LUIGI! LUIGI! LU-
[136:04.57]That was kind of fun.
[136:11.99]You just scared my cat and my dad.
[136:16.71]What?
[136:22.27]Well, keep me on lower volume.
[136:27.26]This is a comedy stream.
[136:32.44]You woke up my husband.
[136:33.86]Well, I... Why are you listening to me at full blast?
[136:36.62]What are you doing?
[136:37.18]Okay.
[136:49.74]That was fun.
[136:51.34]That was worth wasting 15 minutes, 20 minutes on.
[136:53.44]Oops.
[137:04.35]Okay.
[137:06.49]Is it only two or is it three?
[137:07.37]Oh, it's only two.
[137:34.13]I won.
[137:37.44]Let me turn this off.
[137:38.48]Negative is kind of cool.
[137:46.42]How do I just turn it off?
[137:52.35]Do I have to pick one?
[138:00.27]Is warm the default?
[138:04.21]Bray scale is default.
[138:06.01]I'll try warm.
[138:07.62]Actually, I kind of like the color.
[138:12.40]I like the color.
[138:13.50]Wait, there's an optional level here, isn't there?
[138:14.82]I have one shot.
[138:48.50]That's not bad.
[138:49.20]I actually prefer the warm.
[138:50.64]I mean the cold tones.
[138:53.46]But that's still fine.
[138:59.76]Stop right there and shout your guess.
[139:01.22]Three.
[139:03.31]The answer is three.
[139:26.38]Uh, I want my, I want my camera back.
[139:36.08]Um, what should I, happy birthday?
[139:39.08]Cool.
[139:48.46]Happy birthday, whoever's birthday it is.
[139:50.44]No photos allowed.
[139:53.67]I only have one shot here.
[139:54.45]That was really not what I thought I was going to, whatever.
[140:53.31]That kind of works.
[141:21.73]You idiot!
[142:00.44]Now this is content.
[142:02.89]This game is pretty fun.
[142:04.31]I like it.
[142:04.89]Okay, one shot in the camera.
[142:20.11]Now what?
[142:25.90]This one's complicated.
[142:29.60]I feel like it's going to be pretty simple.
[142:31.80]Watch this.
[142:38.61]Where is the teleporter?
[142:42.53]Over there.
[142:44.67]I need two.
[142:45.45]Okay.
[142:47.27]Okay.
[142:59.67]Where's the other battery?
[143:20.55]Whoa!
[143:26.17]Is there more film up there?
[143:34.39]It's alright.
[143:34.93]I just want to see what's... I only have one thing to film, though.
[143:43.80]I need, like, a wide shot of this.
[143:50.54]Oh.
[143:53.03]Okay.
[143:56.65]Huh.
[144:15.18]Shit, um.
[144:22.74]There's one angle I can probably get them both in a picture through the wall.
[144:26.36]Hold on.
[144:30.73]I go like this.
[144:32.01]Will this count?
[144:35.51]And then say if I do that, does that work?
[144:45.54]Uh... Kind of?
[144:51.52]I need some...
[145:06.58]yeah I know but like ah it takes a second something the easy ones sometimes are they you know what I mean sometimes it's not that simple takes an extra two seconds hey
[145:39.13]Now this is the mahjong table.
[145:40.97]Alright, this turns this on.
[145:53.42]Cool, but.
[145:56.92]Interesting.
[146:02.32]They were all so creative.
[146:08.29]What do you call a melon that commits a crime?
[146:14.99]A water felon.
[146:17.03]I didn't even need to look it up.
[146:32.34]See?
[146:35.06]This is weirdly placed.
[146:35.98]Why is it like this?
[146:44.67]Or you duck down here.
[147:01.01]No.
[147:02.65]Well, OK.
[147:14.62]You're tracking dirt in.
[147:16.06]Sit, sit, sit, sit.
[147:17.22]Should I sit?
[147:21.51]Oh, nice.
[147:40.72]Yes, we are quite quirky like that.
[147:44.69]What did we do?
[147:45.21]Alright, I need... Alright, let's just spin it.
[147:52.09]And just put it over here.
[147:56.05]And then this... It's not correct.
[148:04.77]Now I know why that hole exists.
[148:10.29]I get the whole thing.
[148:21.10]Okay.
[148:21.86]Then... Is there a good place to get this whole thing on camera?
[148:36.55]I hope the camera doesn't break.
[148:43.00]I know it.
[148:49.47]She's not the greatest person when dealing with others.
[148:51.86]Mr. Cat, maybe the two of them could bond over a cat pet session or something.
[148:57.02]It's probably right here, yeah.
[148:58.56]Cool.
[148:58.78]Simple.
[149:17.82]gonna play Armored Core I might I'm gonna try it but I'm gonna be very very honest I don't know if I'm gonna play it for a while I gave my take on it I I'm definitely interested okay so looking into this setup there's clearly something wrong with the system the deeper you go the more the data are corrupt due to lack of upkeep
[149:43.47]Definitely going to do sorcery later this week, but there's a few things to do.
[149:47.93]We'll see.
[149:49.56]I'm interested in it.
[149:52.32]You can tell my chin is currently pointing straight down into my neck.
[149:56.82]I'm leaning back because, you know, a burp is a hiccup is here.
[150:01.64]But besides that, yeah, I might play it.
[150:04.45]Let's go!
[150:06.05]Look at that!
[150:08.49]Oops.
[150:08.79]Yeah!
[150:09.21]It definitely worked.
[150:10.73]Ah!
[151:19.64]I can't be clever like that.
[152:10.20]Oh, Gemma!
[152:11.28]You're stupid!
[152:32.78]Have you been moisturizing your neck?
[152:34.88]Yeah.
[152:36.78]Question is, have you?
[152:43.18]Um, well, very clearly, I'm probably going to shoot from the bottom up.
[152:48.19]How's this?
[152:49.97]Yep.
[152:52.13]Yep.
[152:53.63]Just don't want to cut it off.
[153:04.84]I should do it right.
[153:13.74]Yep.
[153:17.84]I like these ones.
[153:18.42]These are fun.
[153:23.48]Oh.
[153:26.70]Um.
[153:27.77]Wait a minute.
[153:35.87]Wait.
[153:36.81]What the?
[153:37.59]What?
[153:38.53]What happened?
[153:40.65]Where am I?
[153:42.62]What is up and what is down right now?
[154:03.56]Hmm.
[154:22.50]I just tapped it so many times and it... Okay, we're good.
[154:35.71]I pray that you've been enjoying your explorations thus far.
[154:40.41]I have been.
[154:42.65]Thank you, cat.
[154:46.25]The hamster powering his brain is getting tired.
[154:54.57]That's such a rude comment, but it's funny, so you get to stay.
[155:01.11]You know what I mean?
[155:01.89]That's a rude comment, but it was funny, so you get to stay.
[155:12.12]Oh, there's more?
[155:29.70]There's many memories stored here.
[155:31.93]Many impossible things.
[155:34.43]That's a record of sorts.
[155:37.49]Filter?
[155:38.53]I like this filter.
[155:39.13]OK.
[155:50.21]So.
[155:55.49]I need to stand here to activate this.
[155:57.65]Is that correct?
[155:58.90]That is correct.
[156:00.52]So I need to take a picture of this while this is activated.
[156:02.70]That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[156:11.79]Okay.
[156:16.15]It's on a timer.
[156:59.28]Okay, I had the right idea.
[157:11.13]Get me in there!
[157:12.01]Shit!
[157:48.97]That was a swift one, wasn't it?
[157:50.59]Really gets your heart pumping.
[157:55.05]Well, if you have one, of course.
[158:17.90]Is this on a timer?
[158:18.45]Okay, this is on a timer too.
[158:24.33]No, it's not.
[158:25.43]So it's just as simple as... Is it just this simple?
[158:41.11]You're doing great, as Tony would say.
[158:43.39]Thanks, Tony.
[158:50.74]I know what to do.
[159:17.56]I know what to do.
[159:19.76]Sort of.
[159:23.78]Got it.
[160:04.87]Uh-oh.
[160:08.16]That's not good.
[160:12.65]Wait a minute.
[160:47.84]I feel like I had it right, but just the wrong angle.
[160:50.53]Did I actually have it right?
[161:16.94]You are one brain blip away.
[161:21.98]Like this?
[161:22.45]Why won't they get powered?
[161:44.27]I need more.
[162:04.60]Oh, come on.
[162:29.34]I'm touching it.
[163:00.36]I only have one photo.
[163:01.58]Shit.
[163:02.30]I'm so close.
[163:03.36]Somebody said I was one brain flip away.
[163:05.52]Hmm.
[163:10.27]Is it?
[163:11.65]It's not.
[163:12.01]Just take a picture of this, right?
[163:13.51]While it's... No, right?
[163:17.84]This didn't work last time, did it?
[163:21.30]No.
[163:37.48]Stand on top of it and then grab... What angle?
[163:42.01]There's a certain angle I gotta get this from.
[163:44.29]I don't know.
[163:44.59]I'm trapped here.
[163:46.53]Do I have to go up top?
[163:52.87]No.
[163:55.19]Talk through the problem slowly.
[163:56.71]Okay.
[163:58.92]There is a teleporter over there.
[164:02.16]I have to stand on that.
[164:03.16]I have one photo.
[164:21.23]To do this, I have to depress this plate while at the same time, this needs to be upright.
[164:27.71]I feel like I did the last three very easily.
[164:31.59]Alright, everybody relax.
[164:44.28]It's alright.
[164:44.76]It's a puzzle game.
[164:45.52]You're supposed to take time on some of these.
[164:52.88]Oh, why am I?
[164:55.54]Why am I having trouble?
[164:56.44]Wait, hold on.
[164:57.08]There's a ladder.
[164:58.06]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[165:00.24]Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[165:05.01]Eh.
[165:06.83]Ah.
[165:08.09]Maybe.
[165:10.39]Maybe.
[165:10.69]Ah.
[165:16.18]No.
[165:17.76]I need to get it all.
[165:18.34]I need to get it in view.
[165:20.74]The whole thing.
[165:23.68]Shit, I don't know.
[165:24.68]This is going to be so simple and I'm just not seeing it.
[165:27.54]I did the hard ones without a problem, but this one is just a head scratcher for me.
[165:33.58]I don't know why.
[165:34.04]I figured, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[165:38.78]The sneeze actually made me know what to do.
[165:39.88]I just have to jumble the brain around a little bit.
[165:42.10]Okay, it's over here.
[165:47.19]You gotta take a picture of this.
[165:52.83]Hold on.
[165:53.07]I got it.
[165:53.31]I got it.
[165:53.57]I got it.
[165:53.77]I got it.
[165:54.05]I got it.
[165:54.33]I got it.
[165:54.77]Hold on.
[165:55.09]Hold on.
[166:00.14]It's... I have to do it like this.
[166:02.60]Watch this.
[166:03.28]Ready?
[166:03.52]Hey, here it is.
[166:05.98]Alright.
[166:06.52]Now I go over here.
[166:11.44]Up on top.
[166:14.68]If I could get on the ladder, that'd be great.
[166:20.80]And then that allows me...
[166:24.32]to, if you check this out, now I'm able to, um, fucking hit this.
[166:35.86]I need another sneeze quick.
[166:46.43]Is there another camera film that I'm not seeing somewhere?
[166:49.47]Am I just overdoing this?
[167:15.85]Shit.
[167:16.03]This is the only one I've been stuck on for this long.
[167:18.97]I've been playing this game for two and a half hours, and it's the only one.
[167:21.89]And I know it's simple, but I can't... What is it?
[167:30.15]Don't tell me.
[167:41.91]Oh, it didn't work.
[167:51.51]Why did it not work?
[168:00.42]Alright, you can take him out of emote only.
[168:06.15]Glad I sneezed.
[168:08.27]I, okay, let me tell you what my problem with that solution was.
[168:12.15]Stop.
[168:12.89]Everybody hold on.
[168:14.35]I took a picture of the thing when it was depressed, and when I went, it didn't go forward.
[168:19.87]But when I took a picture of it when it was timed, the timer and, you know what I mean?
[168:23.98]That was not alright.
[168:28.74]I took a picture of it when it was like this, but it doesn't last.
[168:44.08]See, I didn't know that's what it was.
[168:45.50]I did that one instantly.
[168:57.45]You just almost killed me of laughter.
[168:58.93]You just sit there laughing your ass off at that.
[169:05.13]You know that they're gonna study us in a hundred years, right?
[169:07.62]What?
[169:23.15]They're going to study you.
[169:25.47]Oh, stop.
[169:26.91]Okay.
[169:27.81]This is, I don't have the camera anymore.
[169:29.03]Yeah.
[169:33.80]What do you want to say to people in a hundred years?
[169:36.52]When some scientist is going through like the thousands of hours, the hundreds of millions of hours of streams and videos and stuff, they're going to have, they might see this chat.
[169:45.37]What would you like to say to the scientist a hundred years from now?
[169:53.55]seeing a lot of fuck-yous.
[169:59.15]Now this scientist is going to look at this and be like, what?
[170:01.99]How primitive were they?
[170:03.51]They must have been very primitive.
[170:05.29]They immediately, on talking to a potential scientist in the future, went right to vulgarities.
[170:12.68]Primitive species.
[170:18.28]Oh my... Okay, I can't look at that.
[170:20.98]That actually was weird.
[170:24.78]That was too much for my head.
[170:34.24]I really don't like this level at all.
[170:37.52]If there was a button, if I could press F5 and skip this level, I would do it right now.
[170:41.64]Not because I don't think it's interesting, but because I don't think I can do it.
[170:44.32]I don't think I can handle it.
[170:54.61]Oh, what the fuck?
[171:03.90]God.
[171:04.40]Take your time.
[171:09.93]You got it.
[171:10.35]You beat Sekiro, remember?
[171:15.33]Yeah, I did.
[171:17.53]Thanks.
[171:18.17]That was a nice chat message.
[171:19.59]I appreciate that.
[171:20.35]Thank you.
[171:29.93]It's a bit clever, isn't it?
[171:32.81]Was I supposed to get fooled somehow?
[171:36.05]Oh, I was.
[171:37.01]Wait.
[171:38.38]I think that was supposed to fool me.
[171:49.02]I thought we came together to compare notes.
[171:52.05]I don't have anything new to share.
[171:53.78]Are you sure there's always something new to explore here?
[171:57.02]Nothing of value yet, but soon.
[171:59.74]That was a nice idea.
[172:00.72]Just making sure it's not going to do that again.
[172:22.28]This is a disaster.
[172:23.74]I need to speak with Mirren before this gets any worse.
[172:26.48]Where has she been anyway?
[172:27.92]She's so busy with her work, I haven't seen her outside her space in a while.
[172:31.36]I'll... I'll give her a call.
[172:32.92]I'll get over there.
[172:33.80]This... can't go on.
[172:48.29]Oh, oh, that... Alright.
[172:56.03]Somebody on the dev team is a magician.
[172:58.15]Can I make that?
[172:59.69]Can I say that?
[173:00.69]I'm going to say that.
[173:01.97]Somebody on the dev team, I think, is a magician.
[173:05.45]They know how to do magic.
[173:06.53]You know what I mean?
[173:09.16]I think someone's a magician.
[173:17.62]Like card trick.
[173:19.26]Hey, look, the salt shaker on the table disappeared.
[173:21.34]That type of magician.
[173:23.38]Yeah.
[173:23.64]Oh, yeah.
[173:24.16]Yeah, absolutely.
[173:25.22]Somebody's a magician.
[173:26.08]And I'm curious.
[173:34.37]These are little, like, sleight of hand tricks.
[173:36.17]Okay.
[173:40.74]Okay.
[173:48.96]That's okay.
[173:50.10]That's cool.
[173:51.26]Don't even try to tell me that that's not interesting.
[173:54.12]What we're looking at.
[173:55.34]Cause that's really cool.
[173:56.58]Alright.
[174:05.65]It is not what it seems.
[174:14.07]Yup.
[174:14.83]Uh-huh.
[174:15.65]Cool.
[174:17.80]That's just... Has that just been here?
[174:21.56]Weird.
[174:28.03]Alright, now what?
[174:29.19]This is saying to go down?
[174:30.93]What... What are we gonna... What's the reveal?
[174:32.49]Uh... I don't know.
[174:50.82]Stimulating his monkey brain.
[174:52.37]Should I just fall?
[175:10.90]Ah, that wasn't part of the trick.
[175:12.46]That wasn't part of the trick.
[175:13.28]He went the wrong way.
[175:16.38]He's gone.
[175:19.00]He was supposed to go in the door over here.
[175:20.40]He just walked off the cliff.
[175:24.81]Um, watch your step.
[175:27.33]What is it trying to tell me?
[175:30.63]Wrap around and jump this way?
[175:37.52]Intriguing.
[175:38.32]Okay, then from here.
[175:41.00]I'm imagining there's probably a false floor here that I fall.
[175:45.69]Don't jump, don't jump, don't jump.
[175:56.03]It's telling me to kind of wrap around and fall.
[176:04.67]What is it saying?
[176:10.20]Like, go right around a circle and then left around the top left circle and then straight down.
[176:15.56]Are these directions or is this something else?
[176:24.00]I feel like this is correct.
[176:45.50]no um no I was down here already wasn't I yeah I was already
[177:23.31]Watch your step.
[177:27.88]Is there just a hole in the ground over here that I'm not seeing?
[177:53.92]Filtration system proofs for how long?
[177:56.64]I need to sit down for a second.
[178:02.28]What is this trying to tell me?
[178:18.77]I came in this way.
[178:29.18]The only logical way is over here.
[178:31.40]Right?
[178:34.18]Like, this- out this way?
[178:35.50]I don't know.
[178:43.17]I was imagining, like, right here.
[178:44.35]And you watch your step.
[178:46.99]I don't know.
[178:47.83]I don't know.
[179:05.21]I'm kind of stumped.
[179:06.82]I wonder if it's very simple.
[179:09.50]What does this mean?
[179:10.16]Come on.
[179:26.05]Teleport me down.
[179:45.21]I thought that was going to be it.
[179:48.21]Trace it.
[179:48.75]And then your movements of the mouse will bring you down.
[179:51.21]Hold on.
[179:59.69]Let me drink some of my drink.
[180:02.71]You're a clown.
[180:03.33]You're a clown.
[180:05.37]You're not saying that, but that's what I'm getting from the emotes.
[180:17.51]Shit.
[180:19.87]Why is there no edge here?
[180:37.34]Ooh!
[180:37.66]Look!
[180:38.56]Look at these!
[180:38.94]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, right, right, right, right.
[180:42.70]Here we go.
[180:43.10]Alright, so.
[180:44.98]It was...
[180:48.86]I don't remember what was... Oh!
[180:50.18]Don't go that far back.
[180:54.84]Alright.
[180:55.20]So, it's around the bottom right.
[181:00.51]Loop around the top left.
[181:02.13]Straight out.
[181:07.79]Cool.
[181:08.03]Alright.
[181:22.05]Sneaky.
[181:24.15]Sneaky.
[181:24.57]He's got yellow brain.
[181:31.02]I don't know what's talking about the pillars.
[181:33.40]Don't let them bully you.
[181:35.46]You did good.
[181:35.92]I think I did fine.
[181:43.26]How many batteries?
[181:43.82]Two or three?
[181:45.10]One?
[181:50.95]Really?
[182:03.48]It was never gonna be that easy, was it?
[182:21.57]How do I get in there?
[182:44.31]Oh, god damn it.
[182:45.03]It's a fake wall.
[182:46.15]Okay.
[182:51.53]That doesn't look right.
[182:54.90]Wait, this does not look right.
[182:55.90]Hold on.
[183:14.76]I have to take a picture of it before I... Before I go reveal it, I have to take a picture of it.
[184:12.67]I think I know what to do.
[184:17.92]I like.
[184:21.24]I know what to do.
[184:24.94]I know what to do.
[184:34.09]Watch this ready.
[184:48.94]I, wait a minute.
[185:02.18]I want to like spin this.
[185:04.60]How do I spin it?
[185:05.24]Like this?
[185:38.32]This is tricky.
[185:39.96]Ah!
[185:41.23]But even if I rotate it, will that matter?
[185:43.27]It's not real.
[186:20.72]Hey!
[186:25.06]What happened to it?
[186:32.95]Where did it go?
[186:36.48]What?
[186:37.46]Oh my goodness, I don't know what's going on.
[186:50.41]Uh... So I have to make it active, get a picture of it, and then rotate it and make a picture of it again?
[186:56.92]Wait.
[187:18.54]Okay, okay, okay.
[187:19.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[187:23.76]Uh, I have to touch it from the front.
[187:30.59]That might be alright.
[187:49.49]I don't- I get it, but I don't.
[187:52.62]I get it, but I don't.
[188:09.03]Does that work?
[188:26.13]Fuck.
[188:26.65]I don't know.
[188:28.59]I don't know.
[188:30.13]I get it, but I don't.
[188:32.70]I have to take a picture of it when it's right facing right at the camera.
[188:36.94]But how do I get it to move?
[188:41.34]Without it being the wrong direction.
[188:45.07]I have a different idea.
[188:46.67]Let me try this.
[188:47.81]If I do what I just did.
[188:52.51]And then I take a picture of it.
[188:55.21]And then I put it the other direction.
[188:57.93]Let me try that.
[189:06.42]So now, what happens if I do this?
[189:10.23]Will it be facing the right way?
[189:11.29]Do you know what I mean by this?
[189:14.31]You see what I'm doing?
[189:23.21]I mean, that's correct, but it's not right.
[189:28.69]It's kind of correct.
[189:31.09]What if I just, can I drop it?
[189:32.21]Will it fall out?
[189:33.11]No.
[189:42.98]Ah, this is a, this is a stumper.
[189:48.28]Like, well, can I, will it just, it's not falling.
[189:50.44]Wait a minute.
[189:59.98]That's not what I have to do, is it?
[190:05.45]There's nothing there.
[190:07.17]It's- the shit's empty.
[190:12.11]There's nothing- wha- ahhhhhhh- huh?
[190:15.31]There's nothing there.
[190:16.10]I would have tried that.
[190:22.20]I would have just- I would have tried to do that.
[190:24.18]What the hell?
[190:36.08]I would have probably tried that.
[190:38.54]Oh, what?
[190:41.78]Well, okay.
[190:46.78]Well, I beat it.
[190:55.15]Was it bugged?
[190:56.85]It was bugged.
[190:58.03]It was bugged.
[190:59.49]Well, okay.
[190:59.91]That makes sense.
[191:01.93]I was wondering.
[191:02.41]I was like, why is it not there?
[191:05.29]I thought I had to touch it for then it to be active that it would be there.
[191:08.28]Alright, I want to do the super secret level.
[191:12.20]Where is it?
[191:18.85]All the way up.
[191:29.40]It was there one time.
[191:30.26]Weird that it didn't show up.
[191:33.58]Yeah, I thought that was a bug that it wasn't supposed to be there when it flashed.
[191:37.08]So I was like, oh, that was a bug that it's not supposed to be there.
[191:40.13]There's no optional level here?
[191:46.51]Oh, okay.
[191:46.87]Let's go.
[191:53.00]I'm going to take a quick break.
[191:55.20]Looks like we have a pretty decent amount left.
[192:00.99]Two more chapters.
[192:02.53]I will be right back.
[192:03.20]I'm going to pee.
[192:04.12]Refill my drink.
[192:05.08]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[197:35.99]Looks like we got two more.
[197:39.11]Wow, what a blunder.
[197:42.42]Give me one more second.
[197:43.96]I left my drink in the other room.
[197:46.50]Give me one second.
[200:14.54]I had some cookies.
[200:18.44]I want cookies.
[200:19.38]Keep going.
[200:33.66]So this is chapter four.
[200:37.88]Let's go.
[200:39.90]Mirren's workspace awaits.
[200:42.49]She's rather special.
[200:44.82]The one who started all of this with good intentions, no less.
[200:49.01]She even made me for that.
[200:51.01]I will always be thankful.
[200:52.77]Even though she.
[200:57.03]Well, she really loved this place.
[201:03.78]How many blinkers did you just hit?
[201:17.04]Oh, this one's cool.
[201:19.62]Observatory.
[201:20.20]I love the music in here.
[201:48.63]Pretty relaxing.
[201:54.61]Okay.
[201:55.85]Let's go.
[201:57.09]What mechanic are they going to introduce now?
[202:02.03]Two batteries?
[202:06.03]Why are the batteries different?
[202:11.25]It's spreading.
[202:14.39]I'm concerned.
[202:15.99]Is this a regular battery?
[202:23.65]That's what makes it so weird.
[202:27.04]You can't take a picture of these Phantom batteries.
[202:49.14]Oh, whatever.
[202:49.68]Just put it right here.
[203:05.87]That was just a cough.
[203:07.23]That was just a regular cough.
[203:09.73]It was a regular cough.
[203:11.36]It had nothing to do with any of the things that you're talking about.
[203:17.32]It was just a little... Okay, you know what the cough is from?
[203:19.72]I just drank a bunch of kefir.
[203:22.68]And it's just settling.
[203:24.22]And it was like, okay, it settled and I had to clear my throat a little.
[203:27.75]That's it.
[203:28.13]Alright.
[203:34.91]Ooh.
[203:38.21]Whoa.
[203:42.37]Can I pick up everything or just the cube?
[203:50.30]Kefir is... Oh, hold on.
[203:52.74]People are talking about snacks.
[203:55.14]Saying, hey, hey, what's your snack of choice right now?
[203:59.69]Kefir is another one.
[204:09.65]Wait.
[204:14.29]Okay, so that can remove that gray stuff.
[204:23.53]There it is.
[204:24.01]Cool.
[204:32.08]What do I take a picture of?
[204:40.50]That's too much text for me to read.
[204:43.00]Um... What am I missing here?
[205:36.70]What?
[205:38.50]That's not what I took a picture of.
[205:45.40]I wanted to roll this down the stairs.
[206:00.15]Okay, what?
[206:02.11]So I'm supposed to clear something with this.
[206:24.09]It's a teleporter.
[206:50.81]What the hell is going on?
[207:02.07]Take a picture of the... This right here?
[207:04.33]I'm like, what is... Okay.
[207:07.07]So... Can I... I don't know.
[207:10.19]Can I walk up this or something?
[207:29.70]Okay.
[207:29.80]Uh... Where's game progress...
[207:39.77]I have no idea.
[207:43.43]Um...
[208:11.04]Huh.
[208:14.68]I don't know.
[208:17.18]Oh, Matt, I probably have to climb up this, right?
[208:20.94]Somewhere?
[208:21.26]Hi.
[208:36.65]Okay.
[208:38.17]Um, I...
[208:43.78]Again, I'm playing chess when I should be playing checkers.
[208:47.38]Interesting.
[208:54.42]Alright, there is the end.
[208:58.96]Another phone call.
[209:12.57]He made it.
[209:13.99]I'm so happy.
[209:15.47]Nice work.
[209:16.89]You're near the view you made this.
[209:18.65]You can master anything as far as I can tell.
[209:21.96]The weather disruptor must be around here somewhere.
[209:25.18]It's Marin's life work, right?
[209:26.46]Weather disruptor stashed it away.
[209:29.30]Find it and let's get you out of that.
[209:31.35]We're going to make.
[209:33.39]The weather disruptor weather machine or something.
[209:35.71]I see.
[209:40.31]I need film for the cameras.
[209:42.73]How high can we reach?
[209:43.55]Not even the sky can limit us.
[209:44.87]Alright, there's a... Something over there.
[209:55.08]Looking for film for the camera.
[210:00.44]Okay.
[210:01.14]Is that film?
[210:03.12]Nice milk voice.
[210:04.64]Yeah... Yeah...
[210:15.94]Here we go.
[210:16.32]Alright, now make the bridge to the film.
[210:17.76]That's the fucking worst bridge I've ever made in a video game.
[210:45.70]That has to be the worst bridge I've ever done.
[210:53.92]I... Okay.
[210:57.96]Everything's fine.
[211:03.34]Because you need to do it like that.
[211:05.92]Wait.
[211:37.28]I know what to do.
[211:38.04]You gotta go down here.
[211:38.65]Good enough.
[211:57.53]Good enough.
[212:18.26]What do you mean, dude?
[212:19.47]I have it right.
[212:20.93]I just didn't do it in the right spot.
[212:52.98]Hey, I made it.
[212:56.03]Looking around me now almost feels like seeing into the future.
[212:59.81]How exciting.
[213:04.07]Look at that.
[213:06.43]You remind me a lot of Mirren, you know?
[213:09.67]Always taking new information, mastering it quickly.
[213:12.93]Five pictures.
[213:16.73]Oh boy, this is going to take a lot of brain power.
[213:24.14]This might be the one.
[213:24.94]Okay.
[213:28.14]Five photos.
[213:33.37]What do we got?
[213:33.77]We got a coil.
[213:37.51]Two batteries.
[213:38.97]And a cage.
[213:41.93]Okay.
[213:43.13]I need to take pictures of batteries and drop them in here.
[213:48.07]Let's go look at those first.
[213:53.72]Use useless junk for play with.
[214:00.55]That's not a battery all the way over there, is it?
[214:32.03]Nobody said they wanted to bet on that.
[214:35.79]You would have lost.
[214:39.23]Let's take a selfie and clone yourself.
[214:43.03]Well, I'd have to set the camera up and get my entire body, though.
[214:46.14]Otherwise, it would just be awful.
[214:48.44]Okay.
[214:52.52]One battery.
[214:53.52]That's it.
[214:59.55]Dude, you're a lot smarter now that you have a job.
[215:11.50]Oh no, he has to use his brain every day.
[215:14.08]This is... I don't like this anymore.
[215:16.18]Okay, so what do we do with this?
[215:19.82]How about... Cupcakes!
[215:20.56]How about... How about...
[215:41.38]Cupcake!
[215:48.68]Whoa.
[216:05.99]Shit.
[216:08.41]Um, well.
[216:11.06]Interesting.
[216:12.82]I need to go down and put it like there.
[216:21.52]Oh.
[216:21.68]Uh.
[216:26.60]What's going on here?
[217:24.87]Jesus, I didn't want to do that.
[217:28.71]I have to drop it from here and catch it.
[217:30.89]No!
[217:57.93]I'm gonna do something INSANE.
[218:01.31]It's gonna work.
[218:03.76]It's gonna work.
[218:05.14]Check this out.
[218:11.06]Okay, watch this.
[218:23.41]So far, so good.
[218:42.15]What the fuck?
[218:43.13]This is a... Not what I thought that was.
[218:45.07]Oh, I thought this was flat.
[218:49.05]I thought this was a flat painting.
[218:53.23]Oh, boy.
[218:54.05]That's... Makes everything different now.
[218:57.54]Okay.
[218:58.04]Well, my plan was not a good one, then.
[219:02.94]My plan was really bad.
[219:08.08]Knowing that... I...
[219:15.55]I... I... I don't know.
[219:23.15]Is something in here that I can get?
[219:26.82]The beats!
[219:42.32]Yeah.
[219:42.86]Okay, more film than a ball.
[219:47.73]I don't... I don't... I guess maybe this?
[219:51.11]Does that make sense?
[219:54.03]Sense?
[219:54.31]Does that make sense, what I just did?
[220:00.76]How do I get out of here, then?
[220:24.05]Um, shit.
[220:24.87]I don't really know what to do here.
[220:31.72]I guess I could... I have to, like, replace this whole level with this thing.
[220:41.27]Kind of.
[220:41.59]I'm gonna try my stupid idea.
[220:47.86]My idea is really dumb.
[221:03.52]My idea is actually completely moronic.
[221:18.60]Like, this is the worst idea I've ever had.
[222:04.79]What the fuck do I do?
[222:10.63]Not over here, right?
[222:13.91]I wish I could move it forward and backwards.
[222:16.71]I mean, catching this makes the most sense.
[222:25.07]But then how do I get out of there?
[222:26.99]You know what I mean?
[222:30.76]How do I get out of there?
[223:22.51]What a- What a fucking mess.
[223:29.54]But I-
[223:33.85]I think it's gonna work.
[223:35.93]I actually think I just did it.
[223:37.88]Yeah, I think I got it.
[223:40.02]Did I?
[223:45.06]It's right there.
[223:46.21]It's the right idea.
[223:47.15]Hold on.
[224:19.89]Am I gonna be silent?
[224:22.23]I'm trying to concentrate.
[224:24.49]This is a lot of brain power.
[224:30.67]What pictures did I take?
[224:32.11]Why is there a whole fucking building over here?
[224:34.91]What is all this?
[224:36.25]What is all that?
[224:37.67]I'm so confused.
[224:38.73]I wanted just a picture of the tile.
[225:03.48]Uh-huh.
[225:04.30]Uh-huh.
[225:05.58]Uh-huh.
[225:08.90]Uh-huh.
[225:09.90]Uh-huh.
[225:11.10]Uh-huh.
[225:12.16]Okay.
[225:13.18]Okay.
[225:14.19]Yeah.
[225:15.15]Yeah.
[225:15.61]It sure is.
[225:16.79]It sure is that, isn't it?
[225:18.81]Mm-hmm.
[225:19.69]Okay.
[225:21.25]That was so long.
[225:26.99]Oh, that was so long.
[225:28.38]That took so much.
[225:29.68]I was going to build a whole structure to pick that up and walk it all the way back.
[225:36.18]Wow, I can't believe it.
[225:50.91]OK.
[225:53.49]We're good.
[225:56.63]Chill stream tonight.
[225:57.55]Yeah, I'm I'm just hanging on.
[226:00.93]I'm having a good time.
[226:03.71]OK.
[226:05.11]Here's the problem.
[226:16.67]How do I get them both?
[226:49.66]Hmm.
[226:56.56]Can I get around?
[226:58.36]What is this here for?
[226:59.12]This has got to be here for a reason, right?
[227:53.00]I only have one picture.
[228:01.92]I have one photo to take.
[228:03.16]I just don't know what to take it of.
[228:11.78]You want me to take a picture right up here, don't you?
[228:13.78]Alright, I get a picture of the sky.
[228:32.76]It's not what they wanted.
[228:34.00]Okay.
[228:46.71]I'm gonna get it right here.
[228:48.01]I just did it.
[228:49.13]I just did it.
[228:49.61]Watch this.
[228:54.15]Watch this shit.
[228:54.95]You think I'm fucking around right now?
[228:57.23]You think I'm fucking around?
[228:58.18]Watch this.
[229:47.30]I'm going to get it right here.
[229:51.73]Oh, come on.
[229:57.25]If I only had another shot to take.
[230:14.00]It's so far away.
[230:18.81]It's right here, but it's just not right here.
[231:01.88]Press it.
[231:03.24]Press it.
[231:04.56]Press it.
[231:06.58]Press it.
[231:08.94]What's up?
[231:10.80]What's up, cat?
[231:17.17]Huh?
[231:22.26]What do you mean?
[231:23.66]What's wrong with it?
[231:34.47]You... God damn it.
[231:36.49]I just learned that by doing... I've been pondering about your search.
[231:46.54]We're good.
[231:47.20]Everything's fine.
[231:47.58]I'm wondering, this weather disruptor... Take the pictures of the wall.
[231:53.03]If I'm right, then you're not too far away.
[231:56.21]Tell me, is this your solution to heal the world?
[232:00.24]Brute forcing the puzzle.
[232:01.72]Well, hey, we all have different ways of learning.
[232:07.02]My way of learning was jumping off the side of the building and trying to take a picture of it while it came into view to then slide down it while falling to my death.
[232:17.01]And you can just take pictures through walls.
[232:19.93]But I figured that out because I did that hypothesis.
[232:24.77]So I figured it out still.
[232:32.71]Alright, this will be interesting.
[232:33.53]Where am I going?
[232:37.19]There's one.
[232:37.69]We're doing the same thing we did before.
[232:41.34]I've already learned.
[232:43.94]I already know what's happening.
[232:47.37]I already got it.
[232:49.63]Pretty much a done deal already.
[233:13.57]There we go.
[233:14.33]Stop with the pictures already.
[233:21.40]It's the whole game.
[233:23.66]I'm going to go cold.
[233:29.52]I like the cold colors.
[233:38.29]Optional challenge.
[233:40.37]I want to take a look at it.
[234:01.43]There's gotta be a way, right?
[234:03.17]Hold on.
[234:07.53]Come on.
[234:07.99]There's gotta be a way.
[234:11.41]To take... To keep this going infinitely.
[234:20.66]I don't think there is.
[234:35.38]Is there another one?
[234:45.65]Wait, is this just very simple?
[234:55.03]Oh.
[234:58.81]What?
[235:02.13]Wait a minute.
[235:30.12]There it is.
[235:42.04]123 wait I need one.
[235:44.16]Yeah, one more.
[235:57.59]Did I cheat?
[235:59.92]No, I think that's where you're supposed to do that.
[236:04.78]That was fun.
[236:05.06]I like that one.
[236:07.82]New camera filter painting.
[236:12.44]I'm kind of curious about that.
[236:22.51]Does it look much different?
[236:26.85]How do you even program this?
[236:28.76]That's what I'm saying.
[236:29.40]That's wild.
[236:38.07]Alright.
[236:44.71]Somebody can take a screenshot of that.
[236:49.59]Uh, music, I must admit.
[236:52.25]Magnificent with the guitar.
[236:53.39]She's promised to come by and play for us here again.
[236:55.63]I have more tests to perform before sharing my theories with the others.
[236:59.49]I haven't felt disinvigorated since my first successful Violet build.
[237:02.97]Alright.
[237:07.63]Alright, coil.
[237:09.29]A lot of coils.
[237:12.33]Far too many coils in this one.
[237:13.71]So I have to power all, I gotta power up all these.
[237:18.49]Alright, this one is powered.
[237:20.56]The radio is what powers the coils.
[237:24.14]Okay, so here's what we're gonna do.
[237:25.46]Let's just try it the simplest way possible.
[237:47.95]Shit.
[238:34.41]Nice.
[238:36.88]I got a flow.
[238:37.58]I'm in the zone right now.
[238:40.20]Okay, coils.
[238:40.58]This lever.
[238:40.92]Alright, so I need a radio box to go right here.
[239:03.58]The hamster is running.
[239:04.70]Oh yeah.
[239:10.82]Alright.
[239:11.58]Alright.
[239:11.98]How many?
[239:12.33]Is that it?
[239:12.81]Oh, that's it.
[239:15.25]But wait.
[239:15.61]There's one over here.
[239:39.42]Oh, no, that's it.
[239:40.32]There's one.
[239:43.98]5G audio.
[239:52.76]Telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone.
[240:03.92]Wait.
[240:05.97]I can't take a picture of that.
[240:12.01]Okay, so this is a photo.
[240:12.67]Oh, I get it.
[240:13.85]Alright, so... I have a camera, right?
[240:15.55]I think...
[240:50.63]Okay.
[240:50.91]I'm really rolling on this one.
[241:02.94]Five pictures.
[241:04.46]I wonder if it's just... Just timer, right?
[241:12.00]Oh, this is going to be easy.
[241:13.06]Watch this.
[241:20.81]Nevermind.
[242:03.21]Light travels, sound travels.
[242:04.37]Light, pulse, sound equals kinematics of weather events using light and sound.
[242:29.57]I think I have an idea.
[242:30.21]Ready?
[242:30.45]Watch this and... Let me look around.
[242:42.87]Can I place something on here?
[242:43.79]I don't think so.
[242:52.09]I think I have to get closer and closer.
[242:53.65]How?
[243:13.40]Oh, yep.
[243:14.94]Watch this.
[243:18.13]That's definitely how I'm going to do it.
[244:14.68]I have to be standing the right way.
[244:19.10]I got to the beginning.
[244:19.90]Let me take a few more pictures.
[244:20.84]Um.
[244:54.96]I don't get it.
[245:27.57]I get it.
[245:27.83]Let's get a picture of this.
[245:39.46]No, never mind.
[245:41.26]So I have to bring it.
[245:45.08]I don't know.
[245:47.88]I can't take a picture of that.
[245:48.90]That means that doesn't do anything.
[245:53.10]What can I do?
[245:56.46]Interesting.
[246:25.71]Uh, hold on.
[246:26.47]It's right there.
[246:26.99]I already got it.
[246:40.44]I win.
[246:45.22]Here's the... Whoa.
[246:48.58]Oh, boy.
[246:49.14]This is going to take a little bit of extra extra.
[246:54.88]Oh, peanut butter.
[247:12.66]Okay, so not much else to do, but that's kind of cool.
[247:18.14]So I'm just going to play with this.
[247:33.76]Oh, thank you.
[247:36.14]I'll cherish this.
[249:16.96]Can you think of, like, the most childish image to draw?
[249:19.05]Like, I'm just thinking, okay, what would you draw to be, like, really just... Oh, I know.
[249:25.75]How about, like, somebody giving him, like, the finger?
[249:29.05]No, he's gonna be waving.
[249:30.55]Ready?
[250:06.09]Oh, that's fun.
[250:10.11]There's a cat.
[250:17.90]Alright, now this is where the fun begins.
[250:21.56]Alright.
[250:22.64]We need that.
[250:25.38]We need... This to be... Jeez.
[250:33.22]Um... Actually, this has to be first.
[250:38.46]Think right, so if I go like that.
[250:49.43]Here.
[250:55.84]This needs to be right here.
[250:57.36]It's not gonna work.
[251:07.81]Yes.
[251:08.79]Optional challenge.
[251:12.05]Let's go.
[251:12.35]Only one piece of film.
[251:15.35]That's fine.
[251:15.85]I don't need it.
[252:25.11]I have an idea.
[252:36.85]Just stagger it.
[252:41.93]See what I mean?
[252:59.50]Oh, I get a better picture.
[253:00.97]I need a lot less of the outside.
[253:05.64]There we go.
[253:26.87]That's definitely what I have to do.
[253:27.65]I just not... I gotta get it right.
[253:29.39]Kind of better.
[253:42.55]Kind of?
[253:42.95]I don't know if I can jump to here, though.
[253:58.32]Damn it.
[254:19.26]Can you please play a soap cutting video?
[254:21.12]No.
[254:21.70]Get out of here.
[254:39.22]I got the right idea.
[254:40.32]It's just not the right execution.
[254:59.29]Jumping.
[255:01.53]That looks pretty good.
[255:02.27]That looks kind of good.
[255:07.02]Oh, that is close.
[255:09.29]It's going to be really close.
[255:18.30]Oh, come on.
[255:23.34]Shit.
[255:24.36]So close, but so far.
[255:25.20]Maybe?
[255:25.47]Maybe?
[255:49.19]Is that it?
[255:53.57]Oh, it's so close.
[255:54.57]I think that might be it.
[256:39.32]I'm trying to catch the last pixel.
[256:43.84]Damn it.
[256:44.40]That's the right call though.
[256:56.25]That sounded like Arnold.
[257:13.96]I'm so fucking close.
[257:52.25]That could be the one.
[257:53.05]Ooh, this could be it.
[257:59.86]It could be.
[258:00.34]Damn it.
[258:33.68]Got it.
[258:37.12]There it is.
[258:41.60]I got a new filter.
[258:42.31]Rainbow filter.
[258:42.91]Wow, that's kind of wacky.
[258:57.37]Looks like the negative.
[258:59.09]I'll try it.
[259:00.44]I'll try it for once.
[259:06.65]All optional content completed.
[259:08.43]Let's try this one.
[259:41.44]There's no other photos here, right?
[259:44.52]No.
[259:46.56]I think we're getting to the end of the game.
[259:49.94]One more section?
[259:50.56]I wonder if it's, um... How long it is?
[259:59.59]It's one of these.
[260:01.75]It's one of these where I have to... Go, like, three different ways.
[260:07.95]Okay, I see the teleporter.
[260:12.79]Alright, well that's not going to work, is it?
[260:31.13]How many does it need?
[260:31.81]One or I can't tell.
[260:46.22]It might just be one.
[261:21.07]Is it one?
[261:21.85]I hope it's one and not two.
[261:22.87]If it's two, then I'm in trouble.
[261:24.23]If it's one, I got it right here.
[261:32.77]It is one.
[261:34.25]That was the first try.
[261:35.23]Photocopy?
[261:46.44]What does that look like?
[261:49.00]Nope.
[261:50.26]Stay on this one for now.
[261:52.52]I feel like we didn't get a chance to see it.
[261:53.60]This game is really good.
[261:59.88]It's just really... The puzzles are hard, but they're not too hard.
[262:03.90]Did I do them all?
[262:21.59]Oh, one more.
[262:26.67]Optional.
[262:29.49]There's one more optional.
[262:33.23]And then there are two.
[262:35.11]Alright, there's one more regular level and then there's two optionals.
[262:42.12]Let's try this one.
[262:50.37]They've introduced white.
[262:53.17]I don't have the camera.
[262:59.80]Alright, so I'm going to take a picture of... Okay, I'm going to take a picture of the watermelon.
[263:04.72]Seems easy enough.
[263:20.32]hmm hmm hmm
[263:50.90]Why can I look through this?
[263:53.24]That's kind of weird, right?
[263:57.51]Bro, just stand on it.
[264:05.05]Hmm.
[264:07.87]Hmm.
[264:09.29]Hmm.
[264:14.02]I did not want to go all the way back.
[264:18.44]Hmm.
[264:18.58]Hmm.
[264:41.68]Can I just throw it?
[264:42.30]I can... Don't do that.
[265:00.91]Does this take a pic... Wait, what is this?
[265:03.25]I don't think this takes a picture of anything.
[265:04.55]Yeah, because it's all... Yeah.
[265:09.11]But wait.
[265:11.58]Can I get over here?
[265:19.15]Damn it.
[266:02.09]Shit.
[266:26.56]Oh my melon!
[266:40.07]I don't have the camera.
[266:42.02]So I can't take a picture of the melon.
[266:43.34]I have to take a picture of the melon.
[266:44.32]Wait.
[266:46.40]Can I like stuff it in here?
[266:47.32]What's this hole here for?
[266:49.26]This hole is weird.
[266:50.70]Oh my god.
[266:53.81]This is a weird hole.
[266:54.77]That's a weird hole.
[266:57.17]Isn't it?
[266:57.59]It's perfectly for a melon.
[266:59.91]That is a perfect hole for a melon.
[267:24.22]Hmm.
[267:29.08]I wonder.
[268:02.14]I got I got an idea.
[268:08.52]Yeah, here it is.
[268:09.62]I got it.
[268:12.30]Got it, I got it, I got it.
[268:16.41]This is going to be wacky.
[268:31.65]Can I stand on something?
[268:37.81]Can't move anything over there.
[268:38.59]I can't stand on something.
[268:51.69]Can I activate the camera through the wall here?
[268:53.54]Can I jump off?
[268:54.40]No.
[268:57.02]There's no way to hit that button.
[269:32.83]Fuck you, game.
[269:51.62]I, um... I cheated.
[270:07.49]We know.
[270:11.50]I saw somebody.
[270:12.20]Okay, I was moving over and I see somebody say, cut the watermelon.
[270:15.98]I was like, what are they talking about?
[270:17.82]And then I realized I took the picture and I was like, that's how you cut the watermelon.
[270:21.44]So I half cheated.
[270:23.21]I didn't know how to do it until it was too late.
[270:28.89]So I half cheated.
[270:29.61]That's not even enough.
[270:33.81]Yeah, I get it.
[270:34.31]Okay, I get it.
[270:34.96]I get it.
[270:35.20]I get it.
[270:52.53]Interesting.
[270:53.45]That's funny.
[271:01.88]Please repent.
[271:19.42]You need to eat a watermelon on stream to repent.
[271:45.17]Hey.
[271:49.07]New camera filter.
[271:50.25]Watermelon filter?
[271:51.41]What does that look like?
[271:52.21]I have to know.
[272:05.03]Yeah.
[272:05.55]Alright.
[272:13.29]I it's, it's expensive, but let me tell you something.
[272:21.76]The best juice, the best fruit juice you can possibly purchase.
[272:26.44]And I mean it.
[272:30.30]Have you guys ever had evolution juice?
[272:35.35]Evolution Watermelon Juice or Evolution Orange Juice is... Nothing compares.
[272:41.15]Absolutely nothing compares.
[272:45.87]Absolutely nothing can ever compare.
[272:47.59]A whole lot of no's.
[272:50.31]Really.
[272:53.71]Never heard of it.
[272:54.27]Has anybody heard of it?
[273:02.06]You know where you sometimes will see it?
[273:03.26]You'll see it in Starbucks.
[273:05.23]Starbucks sometimes has them on the rack.
[273:11.87]Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
[273:21.04]Does nobody know this?
[273:22.52]How does nobody know this?
[273:32.32]I've seen this across the country.
[273:33.49]It's not just in Vegas.
[273:40.57]Nice hallucination.
[273:41.68]No, I'm telling you, it's... It's life-changing.
[273:49.33]Now, evolution.
[273:50.37]Evolution juice brand.
[273:55.21]It's, it's very, it's, it's expensive.
[273:58.79]It's a, it's a cold pressed juice.
[274:01.43]Their orange juice is, it goes absolutely nuts.
[274:07.17]It's the kind.
[274:07.73]Okay.
[274:07.89]So when you, when you see it on the shelf, it's half of it.
[274:12.01]Like all the orange is settled to the bottom half.
[274:20.29]And then all the top is like a clear liquid and you have to really shake it up.
[274:24.33]This shit is fucking unbelievable.
[274:31.80]I don't buy it that often, but when I do... Oh, and they have a watermelon.
[274:36.84]Oh, man.
[274:39.31]No, it's not pulp.
[274:40.19]It's not pulp.
[274:45.63]But no, it is kind of pulpy because it's...
[274:48.75]You know, it's the real shit.
[274:50.07]No one's had this.
[274:53.33]There's such an unbelievable orange aftertaste that tastes like a real orange.
[275:04.05]They sell this shit at Starbucks.
[275:05.27]It's not shit.
[275:06.09]It's delicious.
[275:15.12]How much, okay.
[275:16.30]How much is a, like a large, like 32 or like 20, like a big, like jug of orange juice.
[275:22.54]Like how much is it now?
[275:27.78]Six bucks, seven bucks.
[275:34.70]So, so this one, this one is like nine to $10 for jug.
[275:40.56]Six or seven.
[275:41.02]Yeah.
[275:41.26]That's usually what it is.
[275:44.08]But let me tell you,
[275:46.88]If you have an opportunity to try it, it's going to ruin everything for you.
[275:50.04]It's going to ruin everything for you.
[275:51.12]It's going to ruin everything.
[275:59.94]How big of a jug?
[276:01.80]Um... I think it's 32.
[276:04.10]I think it's 32 ounces.
[276:06.81]It might be more than that.
[276:25.98]$11 for... Actually, I think that is accurate.
[276:28.19]Let me... Hold on a second.
[276:29.11]Give me one sec.
[276:29.63]I want to look.
[276:30.61]Actually, I own one right now.
[276:31.91]I saw it and I was like, holy shit, I need this.
[276:34.02]Give me one sec.
[276:34.34]I'll give you the exact ounce.
[276:36.96]The exact ounce-age.
[277:32.65]I just slammed a bunch of it too.
[277:33.89]I just ripped it out of the fridge and just started chugging it.
[277:37.27]Uh, it's 59 ounces and I believe it was $11.
[277:39.13]So, it's about 60 ounces.
[277:44.07]So that's about, you know, it's, it's... 60 ounces, yeah.
[277:56.63]59 ounces.
[277:56.93]No, I didn't drink, I didn't drink 60 ounces!
[278:06.55]So it's 59 ounces.
[278:08.27]It was about 10, 11 bucks.
[278:10.03]Maybe you can get it cheaper.
[278:10.95]Maybe it's more expensive somewhere else.
[278:17.76]The orange juice and the watermelon juice.
[278:22.92]I think they make like, oh, there's vitamins in this one.
[278:25.71]I don't I don't get any of that.
[278:26.95]I just get the straight up juice.
[278:37.92]But I don't see it that often.
[278:41.70]But when I do see it, my eyes just lasers just shoot out at it.
[278:45.13]Like... It's the one with the cursive logo?
[278:54.80]Yes.
[279:02.91]But this is the kind of juice that you sip this.
[279:07.93]I cannot work with that.
[279:12.00]You sip this like it's a fine wine.
[279:15.26]I just... I just told you I slammed it.
[279:35.55]Yeah, it's alright.
[279:44.42]OK, I need.
[279:45.58]Where is the?
[279:51.04]Where is it?
[280:02.93]It's really good.
[280:04.67]You know, if there's one thing that you can tell, okay, if there's one thing that you know about me and this stream and everything about this, I don't mess around when it comes to food brands that I like.
[280:15.71]Have I steered you wrong before?
[280:18.72]Have I steered you wrong before?
[280:20.92]I do not mess around when it comes to foods and beverages.
[280:26.50]I don't screw around.
[280:38.78]I recommend only the finest products.
[280:42.59]Only the most delicious beverages.
[280:44.03]Only the best.
[280:45.49]Dr. Oetker's sucks.
[280:49.55]That is one of the finest frozen pizzas.
[280:52.31]I don't even know if they make it anymore.
[280:54.37]But no, no, no, it does not.
[281:00.32]I've never steered you wrong.
[281:02.78]I believe everything I've said about different beverages and foods.
[281:09.39]Fuck the cheesy Godita Crunch.
[281:11.59]That actually might constitute a ban in this channel.
[281:21.94]Do you think that that's a... I mean, that really might constitute a real, like, permanent ban.
[281:37.11]How do I... What am I doing here?
[281:43.18]What about McDonald's?
[281:46.90]Damn, I love my McDonald's order.
[281:50.56]It's... Two... Double cheeseburgers.
[281:55.49]No pickle.
[281:57.53]One McChicken.
[282:00.25]Not spicy McChicken, but sometimes you can't find that anymore.
[282:03.97]And then a ten-piece nugget.
[282:06.07]Meal.
[282:07.49]So you get the drink.
[282:08.81]And then those nuggets are to be shared with the group.
[282:12.63]Not, that's not the old, like, two or three years ago when me and Ludwig were talking about it.
[282:18.53]No.
[282:19.07]That, two double cheeseburgers, one McChicken, and then nuggets for the table.
[282:24.63]Sometimes I don't even eat those nuggets.
[282:25.95]It's just like, hey, they're here.
[282:31.65]No pickles?
[282:32.17]No, I don't like pickles on stuff.
[282:39.86]Three burgers?
[282:40.64]Holy shit.
[282:47.47]They're not... A McChicken is pretty small.
[282:53.79]No fries?
[282:55.57]No, you... The fries come with the McNuggets.
[283:02.75]And I might... I don't really eat the nuggets.
[283:05.16]It's just like I get them because... Here's the thing about nuggets.
[283:08.62]A lot of times, people don't want to order them.
[283:12.40]Like, oh, yeah, I could get nuggets.
[283:13.91]But it's like, don't worry.
[283:16.37]I got you.
[283:17.05]I got you covered.
[283:19.31]I'm going to get them and we can all just share out of the box.
[283:21.63]Fine.
[283:22.76]I got you.
[283:23.20]I got you.
[283:24.78]They always get eaten.
[283:26.28]They're always eaten.
[283:27.50]All of them.
[283:35.75]I don't eat all of it.
[283:37.71]There's been a misconception that I eat every single thing in that order.
[283:42.84]And here's... Listen to me.
[283:44.80]If there is no group... If there is no group... A McChicken is deleted.
[283:53.08]A Double Cheeseburger is deleted.
[283:55.18]And it's a 10-piece nugget meal.
[283:57.96]And a Double Cheeseburger.
[284:00.04]For the Powerade.
[284:00.94]That's it.
[284:11.16]Why did I just take a picture of this?
[284:19.02]Alright, where am I going?
[284:30.87]It's over there.
[284:31.55]I need to look.
[284:34.51]See what the hell's going on here.
[284:51.61]Get me Okay, I need to This fence is like pissing me off so bad
[285:26.58]There we go.
[285:27.02]Okay.
[285:37.69]So what did we learn?
[285:38.57]We learned a few things.
[285:39.31]We learned evolution juice is probably the best.
[285:49.63]It's three.
[285:52.69]Damn.
[285:53.03]Okay.
[285:53.51]Hold on.
[286:20.62]Your order comes out to be about 2000 calories.
[286:24.42]How much is a double cheeseburger from McDonald's with no pickle?
[286:27.54]Just one double cheeseburger.
[286:28.94]What is it?
[286:37.21]Just a double cheeseburger.
[286:38.47]It's 400.
[286:40.13]So that's four, eight.
[286:45.13]And then how much is a McChicken?
[286:52.40]Standard McChicken.
[286:53.56]No, nothing on it.
[286:58.10]350?
[286:58.18]It's 1100 calories.
[287:06.46]Uh, this level's too hard.
[287:21.24]What size drink?
[287:23.04]I usually don't do... I don't really get... Here's what I'll do.
[287:31.29]I'll get a powerade and I'll just put it in the fridge.
[287:33.63]I'll maybe take a few sips out of it, but I usually save most of it. ...
[287:49.45]I am kind of a weird person.
[287:51.99]And I know a lot of people like this too.
[287:54.41]So raise your hand if you like this as well.
[287:57.03]When I'm hungry and I eat... I don't really drink a full drink.
[288:05.28]I just kind of... I think a drink kind of fills you up a lot.
[288:11.06]Sometimes I won't even take a sip of something for a little while.
[288:14.62]I used to be like that, yeah.
[288:17.84]I think a lot more people do that than I think.
[288:22.80]Obviously, like, I'm not just gonna wolf down food without a drink.
[288:26.80]That's not good.
[288:28.04]I'll take a sip or two, maybe.
[288:29.08]Every so often.
[288:36.35]More people do that, yeah.
[288:39.33]I think that's why I'm able to eat a little bit more food.
[288:42.26]It's because I'm not filling up with a big 32-ounce drink.
[288:49.96]The drink is the first thing I finish.
[288:52.39]See, that's super foreign to me.
[288:59.09]And let me make this very clear.
[289:02.63]This is a once in a while delicacy.
[289:07.56]I am not eating 1,100 calories, 1,200 calories of McDonald's every day.
[289:15.40]This is like once in a while delicacy.
[289:19.90]And hey, guess what?
[289:20.92]I have some really bad news for you.
[289:22.98]That large milkshake that you got from the fucking ice cream store is probably 1,400 calories.
[289:31.08]So, hey, don't come charging at me.
[289:39.53]This is weird.
[289:40.47]Alright, so I need one.
[289:41.53]Okay, let's try to get this done.
[289:49.08]Weird.
[289:49.82]Okay.
[289:50.72]Oh, goodness.
[289:53.10]Alright, so this one is... This one has color.
[290:03.58]Alright, it's time for the ultimate poll.
[290:06.14]The ultimate food poll.
[290:07.36]Are you guys ready?
[290:08.60]Let's do it.
[290:11.24]How many scoops of ice cream would you consider to be?
[290:16.40]That's good.
[290:17.31]from not from the not from the freezer where you're doing it on your own I'm talking about you're at an ice cream store and it's like okay here you go here are the sizes it's one two three one two or three which one is it I'm gonna give you the correct answer when we're done doing the poll
[291:05.24]Somebody said one.
[291:06.18]I'm ashamed to say more than three in public.
[291:17.19]Look at this.
[291:24.92]That was not as hard as I thought it was going to be.
[291:34.04]Decentrist Andy, we already know this.
[291:36.12]Well, that might not be correct.
[291:39.07]Let's see.
[291:42.83]Okay.
[291:44.37]Very interesting.
[291:46.91]The correct answer is 1.
[291:49.47]The correct answer is 1.
[291:50.35]I'm going to give you the reason why.
[291:55.80]I've gone to get an ice cream before and you go, you know, usually it's usually in the evening times.
[292:06.61]And one scoop of ice cream from a place, from a store, is usually massive.
[292:13.33]Massive.
[292:14.59]To a point where I'll eat half of it.
[292:17.99]I'll eat two thirds of it and be like, jeez, I just can't do it anymore.
[292:25.00]Yeah, that's a good point.
[292:26.47]It really depends on where.
[292:28.63]But most places really, really pile it on.
[292:33.72]And I've even been to places where I go, yeah, yeah.
[292:36.36]Can I, can I get one?
[292:37.90]Just like the little, just small one.
[292:40.47]And the worker is super nice and really, really wonderful.
[292:45.95]And they're like, I got you.
[292:46.89]I got you.
[292:47.21]Yup.
[292:48.11]And they really just cut, they kind of give a little extra and it's just like, are you okay?
[292:53.36]Alright.
[292:53.64]Alright.
[292:53.92]We're good.
[292:54.22]We're good.
[292:54.60]Okay.
[292:55.02]That's alright.
[292:57.74]It's like super nice.
[293:04.09]I would like to order the little kids.
[293:10.76]Um, I want to, I want like the smallest possible one because after a while, please raise your hand if you're like this.
[293:21.57]After like bite number 10 of an ice cream.
[293:27.19]It sort of starts to get a little... Like the flavor kind of goes away, and it kind of just becomes like milk to me.
[293:34.21]It gets a little kind of heavy and... Not a lot... Yeah, bite!
[293:38.57]Like you're eating a... There was a communication breakdown.
[293:45.36]There was a communi... There was a communication breakdown tonight.
[293:48.64]There was a commu... Oh shit, this is so funny.
[294:06.25]I should have... I should have started like this.
[294:12.21]I'm talking about in a cup.
[294:14.01]Not... I shouldn't... I'm not talking about ice cream cone.
[294:16.80]I'm talking about in a cup with a spoon.
[294:25.08]I probably should have made that a little clearer.
[294:29.39]I just keep imagining just... Just taking big bites out of an ice cream.
[294:34.59]You'd be like, holy shit, dude.
[294:37.79]That's like... That's what like a dog would do.
[294:40.47]Like, stop.
[294:41.68]Slow down.
[294:51.14]Okay.
[294:52.60]So now that we have that clear.
[294:54.92]When you get more than two scoops of ice cream in a cup...
[295:00.63]It just gets so heavy after a while.
[295:04.79]I'm glad we could clear that up, though.
[295:06.21]Thanks for joining.
[295:08.63]I just keep seeing somebody just be like, oh, thanks, I appreciate it.
[295:16.74]Like, bite, bite, bite, bite.
[295:21.00]I feel like I was on a prank video.
[295:23.89]Like, what is this guy doing?
[295:39.12]Yeah, there was a little communication breakdown there, but that was, oh, that was funny.
[295:51.02]Oh, man.
[295:51.42]Back here.
[296:12.36]You've done well.
[296:14.12]Traversing this maze of memories and forgotten wonder.
[296:18.74]I hope your experience has been pleasant so far.
[296:22.10]To me, it's been wonderful.
[296:25.54]This is going to be awful.
[296:28.34]Okay, so it's blue.
[296:29.56]It's blue.
[296:34.10]What about the McGriddle?
[296:35.34]See, the McGriddle is kind of where I draw the line.
[296:39.27]Because it's not that I don't like the McGriddle.
[296:42.95]But it's kind of too much for me.
[296:45.43]Shit.
[296:58.77]Alright, I need a minute to pay attention to this.
[297:00.65]What's the point of me doing this, by the way?
[297:06.74]Yeah, why wouldn't I just... Wait a minute.
[297:13.86]It tastes really good.
[297:14.74]I need to... Give me a second.
[297:28.43]Oof.
[297:28.93]This hurts.
[297:30.51]This hurts.
[297:31.21]Okay.
[297:31.93]Um... I think I'm just gonna skip the blue.
[297:41.41]Ugh.
[297:46.08]I don't have a camera or anything.
[297:46.98]I mean, it's open right now.
[297:51.59]Can I just... Wait, yeah.
[298:04.21]Is it changing?
[298:04.75]Looks like it's changing.
[298:06.03]Damn it.
[298:33.60]This one's confusing me.
[298:39.60]Am I missing something to do here?
[298:54.47]I keep thinking of somebody just biting an ice cream, like, hard.
[298:57.55]That would be so bad on your teeth.
[299:00.04]I feel like my teeth would just... Ugh.
[299:05.87]It is a mobile game ad.
[299:12.04]So what?
[299:12.54]I guess... Okay.
[299:14.74]I think I understand.
[299:17.48]If I go through blue, walk through blue, step on that, go through... I don't... I don't... I don't get it.
[299:25.78]Let's go through red.
[299:28.64]They line up.
[299:35.54]Yeah, but I mean, why would I walk all the way over here to turn it red to walk all the way that way?
[299:44.59]What is this one even doing?
[299:47.83]This one's not even taking down something.
[299:49.11]What is it?
[299:49.37]What is this doing?
[299:50.55]This is doing something.
[299:57.53]What's the point of this one?
[300:20.00]I'm gonna just try this way and see what happens here.
[300:26.08]Like, I... You're changing the portals.
[300:37.26]Red has always been over here.
[300:42.62]Now that's blue.
[300:45.18]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[300:49.15]Ah, okay.
[300:49.59]Okay.
[300:49.85]Yep.
[300:50.03]Yep.
[300:50.17]Yep.
[300:50.31]Yep.
[300:50.43]Yep.
[300:50.59]Alright.
[300:50.95]Sorry.
[300:51.07]I was talking about ice cream and shit.
[300:53.59]Alright.
[300:53.85]Yep.
[300:54.03]Yep.
[300:54.25]Yep.
[300:54.47]Yep.
[300:54.73]Yep.
[300:54.91]Alright.
[300:55.17]I got it.
[300:55.45]I got it.
[300:55.67]I got it.
[300:55.93]I know exactly what... Yeah, I got it.
[300:56.95]It's done.
[300:58.61]I wasn't... Yeah.
[301:00.37]I think... I don't think anybody knew that was going on except for one person.
[301:14.13]What's this?
[301:14.39]What type of ice cream?
[301:15.07]What's the... What's this for?
[301:20.30]Officer.
[301:20.90]Oh, yeah, this is this is an easy one for me.
[301:23.80]Isn't making it this far enough, haven't you gained all the knowledge this place has to offer this?
[301:31.50]What was her life's work?
[301:32.64]And it's it's meaningful.
[301:36.08]But it's not right in the way you want.
[301:41.78]Because these.
[301:43.75]This is the big reveal that wait, are they still in the simulation?
[301:57.49]Scoop, I believe, is the correct answer.
[301:59.67]Scoop is correct with one thing that takes that completely out of the way.
[302:07.61]Soft serve with a cherry dip is unbeatable no matter what.
[302:16.66]Cherry dip, vanilla cherry dip is, with a soft serve, nothing will ever compare, ever.
[302:30.15]They do, like, chocolate dip, too, is good, too, as well.
[302:34.29]I think cherry dip soft serve is just S+, and even the best S hard ice cream is, um, is below cherry dip.
[302:45.28]You never had a cherry dip before?
[302:46.42]Uh, Dairy Queen used to do it.
[302:50.45]Does Dairy Queen still do it?
[302:51.37]That's where you can get it.
[302:55.72]It's really good.
[302:56.34]I feel like we need to pay attention right now.
[303:00.56]Hmm?
[303:24.90]This isn't it.
[303:25.88]It can't be.
[303:26.92]The solution, it all made sense.
[303:29.18]The formula, the structure.
[303:31.13]This should have solved all our problems.
[303:33.49]This should have been the answer.
[303:35.01]I need this to be the answer.
[303:37.21]Why?
[303:37.51]Why isn't this working?
[303:39.80]I can't give up.
[303:55.17]Twist is good too.
[303:57.12]Soft serve Twist.
[304:25.17]Honestly, I'm not sure I could really pick, you know, hard scoop ice cream is better than soft serve.
[304:30.21]That's like a ketchup versus mustard fight.
[304:36.18]I don't think I'm going to crown a winner there.
[304:47.38]He does not care.
[304:49.74]What?
[304:49.96]What?
[304:50.41]What happened?
[304:50.79]Did something really, like, bad happen?
[304:54.53]Uh-oh.
[304:55.85]What did I... What happened?
[304:56.83]What did I do?
[305:07.14]Oh, I don't know what happened, but...
[305:18.50]I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean, I'm keeping it on watermelon.
[305:23.62]No, I want it to be, is that the last part of the game?
[305:33.19]Is it?
[305:36.11]The final chapter.
[305:42.38]Mustard is disgusting and you should feel disgusting for liking it.
[305:47.45]Oh, should we tell him about honey mustard?
[305:48.99]And how that is just.
[305:53.33]Sad that that opinion is.
[305:57.12]That's if honey mustard is.
[306:01.80]Existing just makes it hard for me to agree with that.
[306:08.58]A good stone ground mustard with honey mustard.
[306:13.10]Ketchup is good too.
[306:13.96]I don't love ketchup on a lot of things, but the things I do like it on, I love it.
[306:26.15]Honestly, mustard is way more versatile than ketchup.
[306:29.93]Ketchup is just kind of ketchup, and it's just ketchup.
[306:31.75]You know what you're getting, and it's very classic, and it's good.
[306:34.29]But there are dozens of varieties of mustard.
[306:36.97]You can turn it into completely different things.
[306:41.84]Now you can put like, you know, a hot sauce and ketchup and you can change ketchup a little, but I think it's mustard has changed almost completely when you add things to it.
[306:53.09]Alright, let's go for it.
[307:02.35]What do we got?
[307:03.35]Final chapter.
[307:18.23]Everything's kind of floating around.
[307:19.19]I have a feeling I'm going to have to touch some stuff.
[307:31.82]But pastrami sandwich with mustard on it.
[307:33.60]Slice of cheese.
[307:38.56]The mustard makes the whole thing.
[307:48.65]Mmm, camera over here.
[307:53.38]Are you just hungry?
[307:54.46]I think I'm just hungry every time I stream.
[307:57.26]Because I don't eat on stream.
[307:58.62]I think I figured out the formula, guys.
[308:02.09]I don't eat on stream.
[308:03.99]And sometimes I'm live, you know, for four, five, six straight hours.
[308:06.71]And I just, I'm not eating on stream.
[308:08.29]So I just, I'm thinking about the delicious foods that I would like to have.
[308:18.23]Oops.
[308:18.39]Okay, so... I don't have a camera.
[308:31.90]Can I take... Alright, I think I can take this.
[308:37.21]Alright, I gotta...
[308:47.40]This will delete the fence, right?
[309:00.58]Wait.
[309:01.92]This is taking a delayed photo?
[309:19.92]Did I do anything about this?
[309:22.42]There's a lot of photos in this thing.
[309:30.24]Are we gonna get to see what I look like?
[309:48.50]I'm imagining I can then... Can I teleport myself in here?
[309:51.06]Now that's cool.
[310:05.67]Where's his phone?
[310:10.92]Hello?
[310:13.00]Hello?
[310:14.18]Are you there?
[310:15.78]I can barely hear you.
[310:17.60]you hear me where are you you're completely out of my field now did the machine just fall apart how could that happen ham and cheese mustard in the toaster oven this is bad this oh yeah this means that there's nothing here for us did we just waste all of this time I don't know you need to find a way out I I can't seem to locate you
[310:47.39]I think it was the, oh yeah, that just fucked me up.
[310:53.13]Alright, I won't talk about food anymore.
[310:54.93]Let's go.
[310:57.75]Oh, oh yeah.
[310:59.56]Oh yeah.
[311:00.48]Say it's ugly.
[311:02.18]I don't mind.
[311:02.76]In fact, I would appreciate the honest feedback.
[311:07.54]Here I adhere out with it.
[311:09.96]Barcode.
[311:10.64]It's hideous.
[311:11.82]I'm so sorry.
[311:13.16]It's the ugliest thing I've ever laid my eyes upon.
[311:18.39]Make sure of it.
[311:20.79]I'm not there.
[311:34.80]Holy shit, that's OK, that's cool.
[311:45.69]Barcode forest.
[311:51.72]Anything here I can grab or no?
[311:54.03]I think it's a cool thing to do.
[312:14.87]Just take a picture of this.
[312:29.10]Now I have to teleport in here, so how do I get... Maybe I do just have to stand in the forest.
[312:38.35]Will it see me in there?
[313:00.07]Oh shit, I deleted it accidentally.
[313:12.94]Why would I go in the bar?
[313:14.16]How did I do that?
[313:14.64]How do I get out of here?
[313:29.99]Forest.
[313:47.29]I can do it twice.
[313:58.83]It's a lot easier than I was making it.
[314:00.61]Okay.
[314:11.76]Picture, let's take a, I'm just gonna take six selfies.
[314:36.59]I don't need more than that.
[314:44.70]Wait a minute.
[314:46.70]How do I... How do I get out of here with the battery?
[315:00.49]Hmm.
[315:12.11]Okay.
[315:14.41]So now... Can I get out of here like this?
[315:29.11]Oh, wait a minute.
[315:30.17]Okay.
[315:47.92]Got it.
[315:50.24]Now.
[315:50.78]How do I get?
[315:54.60]I know and I don't have enough photos.
[316:14.11]What if I'm holding the battery in my hands during the picture?
[316:16.41]I'm doing that.
[316:26.96]Got it.
[316:29.66]Let's go.
[316:45.22]Take a look.
[316:45.84]Alright, I need to get over there.
[316:48.34]There is no battery.
[316:51.03]I have to eventually teleport over there.
[316:54.03]Getting down here looks like a bunch of bullshit.
[317:00.85]That's a text.
[317:06.16]Elevate the pollutant degradation system.
[317:11.81]Alright.
[317:12.17]Can I pick any of this up?
[317:40.97]Okay, the camera is right here.
[317:42.47]Do I have to jump?
[317:43.41]I think I have to jump to get in it.
[317:47.89]No, I don't.
[318:00.84]I have to jump.
[318:20.34]Did I get it?
[318:29.16]I did it.
[318:32.74]You are doing really, really well.
[318:41.36]Everything is a constant force, building pressure.
[318:46.11]And now?
[318:48.93]now it's falling apart still wear those beads on your arm talking about my uh my crystals alright do I need to
[319:23.58]Yeah, I had a black tourmaline bracelet on one day, and everybody thought I was, like, a healer or something.
[319:29.66]And I was like, I just liked it.
[319:30.60]Hmm.
[319:47.47]Hmm.
[319:55.60]I wonder if I do this.
[320:10.63]And this will be kind of far away.
[320:11.87]Which means I can teleport up there.
[320:15.13]Uh-huh.
[320:20.51]Yes.
[320:20.77]I just have to get it in the right spot.
[320:29.50]Only got two more levels left or two more areas.
[320:59.11]What's the mechanic in this one?
[321:02.87]Camera's back.
[321:11.36]Weird.
[321:11.62]I knew this was inevitable.
[321:19.46]How could you?
[321:49.09]One battery.
[321:50.07]It destroys everything it takes a picture of now.
[321:53.25]Which... When was the last time I heard somebody do that?
[321:58.47]Jeez.
[321:58.75]So what if the weather disruptor didn't work?
[322:01.20]This can't be the end of everything we want.
[322:02.96]All the research.
[322:04.92]All the memories.
[322:06.68]We need to keep pushing forward.
[322:09.84]Okay.
[322:12.02]I refuse to leave this place until I know the answer.
[322:15.02]Until I save everything.
[322:34.26]Um... I need like a... sort of a bridge or something.
[322:44.84]Hmm.
[323:14.00]Is that far enough?
[323:18.54]Ugh!
[323:46.07]Whoa!
[323:46.85]I forgot everything.
[323:55.30]Shit.
[324:03.19]I gotta take a picture in front and then behind.
[324:24.76]There we go.
[324:40.37]This is wild.
[324:42.93]It's wild.
[324:56.17]I give you a baby scoop ice cream.
[324:59.68]It's just, it's a manageable scoop.
[325:03.02]And sometimes I just want one, just a little bit.
[325:06.64]Especially if it's something like, oh yeah, here, here's our, our special, you know, blueberry cheesecake ice cream.
[325:12.57]It's like, okay, I just, I don't want a whole, I don't want a lot of that.
[325:14.71]I just want enough, but it sounds great.
[325:29.03]Maybe take a picture of the windmill?
[325:32.39]Ow.
[325:32.49]You're going to get a sample and get full from it.
[325:36.25]Now I want one scoop.
[325:58.90]Blueberry cheesecake ice cream.
[326:01.99]Or strawberry cheesecake.
[326:03.73]Or fudge cheesecake.
[326:11.85]Or... Oh, it's 9 o'clock.
[326:18.35]It's over.
[326:20.25]I'm about to say something that's going to really... You know what?
[326:22.91]I might not even say it.
[326:27.32]Because a lot of you are going to hear this and it's going to be a sigh of God damn it.
[326:35.61]Butter crunch ice cream.
[326:37.11]Yeah.
[326:37.21]What is that?
[326:52.18]it's butter pecan ice cream but there's no pecans in it there's just little crunchies in it it's that delicious buttery sweet flavor oh that's boomer ice cream it is not please
[327:14.13]It is awesome.
[327:15.25]It's really good.
[327:15.87]You Americans disgust me.
[327:16.91]That's a green eggs and ham moment.
[327:18.46]Just wait till they take a bite.
[327:19.38]Oh, I think I was supposed to copy this.
[327:51.64]the only thing I can copy.
[328:05.20]Best Ben & Jerry's flavor?
[328:06.32]That is half-baked.
[328:15.66]You have a... Oh, shit, I do have a camera.
[328:18.82]Oops.
[328:21.10]I don't need it.
[328:29.03]Okay, I just beat it.
[328:31.31]Watch this.
[328:58.91]Half-baked is my go-to, yeah.
[329:01.43]I think it's just the easiest one.
[329:05.41]It's definitely the easiest one to get.
[329:06.77]There's a lot of other good ones for Ben and Jerry's too, but half-baked is just the best one to get.
[329:13.99]Fish food's pretty good.
[329:19.39]I'm a sucker for marshmallows, so.
[329:20.71]Okay, just one?
[329:39.81]Hmm.
[329:50.37]Interesting.
[329:58.66]No more film on the camera.
[330:01.58]Can I jump over there?
[330:09.32]Hmm.
[330:14.76]Did I do this wrong?
[330:28.34]Not this way, right?
[330:29.84]Oh!
[330:44.79]There.
[330:45.31]There it is.
[330:45.63]Okay.
[330:45.91]It's right here.
[331:00.38]Hmm.
[331:03.52]I think.
[331:05.27]I just did it.
[331:08.17]I did it.
[331:18.14]This is the last one.
[331:22.30]What about up top?
[331:22.84]I want to see up top.
[331:25.51]Last level, so let's take a look.
[331:28.79]Ah, there's one more.
[331:40.59]Selfie.
[331:43.13]Selfie, but I have the camera.
[331:50.73]I'll take another one.
[331:51.35]Okay.
[332:02.83]Yikes.
[332:07.98]Battery.
[332:08.48]Two batteries.
[332:14.36]Ah.
[332:16.68]I... Got it.
[332:36.29]Shit, um, hold on.
[333:01.04]I need to get a picture of this.
[333:06.19]That'll do it.
[333:08.33]What about that moldy ice cream?
[333:10.17]Yeah, but that was my fault.
[333:13.53]I didn't realize it was there for that long.
[333:24.96]It wasn't even moldy.
[333:25.90]It was freezer burn.
[333:48.10]Yeah.
[333:55.71]That was very funny though.
[333:57.59]I will admit.
[334:11.82]Timer.
[334:15.20]That's just, that's the stacker sound.
[334:21.15]And then it goes oh no Hmm camera oh
[334:53.72]Very obviously, I need to go like this.
[335:01.90]Put this over here.
[335:02.82]And then take a picture of me there.
[335:16.19]And then teleport across the game over there.
[335:25.81]Yes!
[335:32.68]This is it.
[335:33.34]We're at the end.
[335:33.76]This is the final level.
[335:49.06]I want ice cream so bad now.
[335:50.30]I do apologize.
[335:53.57]It's getting later here.
[335:55.27]It is definitely very late where you are.
[335:58.95]Potentially.
[336:03.62]Five minutes.
[336:07.90]Go.
[336:23.88]This is gonna be a huge pain in the ass, I can already tell.
[336:27.40]It's still going!
[336:28.30]I'm rewinding time, what's happening here?
[336:31.70]What the hell?
[336:33.98]Oh boy.
[336:35.74]Wait, hold on.
[336:40.48]What do I- I don't know- Where do I go?
[336:44.50]I just- Can I restart the level?
[337:07.35]Where did it?
[337:07.79]Where did it?
[337:08.83]Where did it?
[337:09.41]Where did it?
[337:10.33]Where is it?
[337:10.81]There.
[337:25.06]Why did it disappear before?
[337:37.47]I'm impressed.
[337:38.89]Even now.
[337:45.71]Come on, go!
[337:53.37]What drives you?
[337:55.79]Hesitation is the enemy of innovation.
[338:04.90]Oh my god, dude.
[338:06.68]Come on.
[338:07.10]This bullshit.
[338:18.81]Oh my god.
[338:28.02]I'm not letting it go.
[338:29.10]It's...
[338:44.74]What am I supposed to do with this?
[338:52.12]Oh, where is it?
[338:52.86]Dude, what am I?
[339:07.57]What?
[340:07.64]What was the, why is the radio there?
[340:10.72]What was the point of the radio?
[340:13.82]I don't get it.
[340:23.46]It's just a distraction.
[340:24.60]Was it really?
[340:25.15]That's annoying.
[340:35.58]Oh, what about, um, what's his name?
[340:37.86]I don't know.
[340:38.36]Whatever.
[340:38.68]It's a distraction.
[340:39.28]Just go.
[340:50.16]It's time for distraction news.
[341:46.07]Oh my goodness gracious.
[341:52.01]This fucking level.
[342:00.10]Get up there, you stupid fucking thing.
[342:03.85]Oops, I fell off.
[342:35.49]What's this?
[342:37.23]I'll take it.
[342:37.83]I'll take it.
[342:38.87]Teapot?
[342:52.03]You always were quick with a clever solution.
[343:24.79]Where are we going?
[343:25.23]Where are we going?
[343:25.71]This way?
[343:28.94]I need two batteries.
[343:31.68]Two.
[343:31.96]Oh, my goodness.
[343:35.08]Oh, shit.
[343:45.33]I need... Where are the batteries?
[343:47.71]Oh, my God.
[343:51.80]Oh, boy.
[343:54.14]Oh, um, OK, well, I don't do that yet.
[344:29.92]Hurry up, come on.
[344:43.33]What the fuck did I just do?
[344:44.65]Oof!
[344:49.33]Whoa!
[344:52.22]Oh, uh-oh.
[344:55.22]Oh, come on.
[344:57.52]Wait, where?
[344:58.96]Wait, hold on.
[345:00.50]What the heck just happened?
[345:04.18]Oh shit, this is not real.
[345:06.06]Alright, alright, right, right, right.
[345:12.25]Ah.
[345:14.35]Um.
[345:18.03]Uh.
[345:19.39]Ooh.
[345:49.12]Alright, what do I need?
[345:52.14]Do I need batteries?
[345:55.68]What are you trying?
[345:56.32]Okay, go around the pillar in a circle, but what's the pillar?
[345:59.06]Where is it?
[346:02.60]Where is it?
[346:03.72]Where is it?
[346:04.28]Where is it?
[346:04.76]Where is it?
[346:05.12]Should I take another one?
[346:42.73]Come on, dude, do it!
[346:45.09]You're killing me with this bullshit.
[346:47.35]You are killing me.
[346:52.98]You're killing me with this.
[346:53.86]You're killing me.
[346:54.46]You're killing me.
[346:54.90]You're killing me.
[346:55.32]You're killing me.
[346:57.74]You are killing me with this.
[347:00.06]Um... You're killing me!
[347:02.36]No!
[347:06.90]No!
[347:07.46]No!
[347:09.49]It's over.
[347:10.29]I lose.
[347:10.97]I can't.
[347:30.56]What?
[347:30.86]I just got three Luigi notifications in a row.
[347:44.64]Luigi is spam texting me right now.
[348:26.01]I'm flexing that one.
[348:33.59]Okay, now the battery is down here.
[348:45.62]Fuck!
[348:46.68]Well, I forget.
[348:47.48]I forget.
[348:47.78]I forget.
[348:48.16]Hold on.
[348:48.46]Go back, back, back, back, back.
[348:49.18]What?
[348:49.58]Um...
[348:51.79]Um, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[348:53.83]I take, um... I, why did I fucking forget this?
[348:58.77]The photocopier!
[348:59.63]I forgot I had this stupid fucking photocopier.
[349:12.05]I don't even need to take two copies of this.
[349:13.67]I have two, I already have two copies.
[349:37.68]I forget!
[350:08.23]Pace is fine.
[350:08.93]I got three minutes.
[350:10.38]It was two and a half minutes.
[350:34.04]Okay, alright.
[350:35.26]I need two batteries there.
[350:39.70]Um... Okay.
[350:42.86]We're gonna teleport over there.
[350:45.10]Am I?
[350:45.42]No, I'm not.
[350:53.31]Okay, alright, alright.
[350:54.11]Now I need to get batteries in... I need the radio.
[351:07.08]Do I actually need the radio?
[351:10.76]Where's the radio?
[351:14.84]Where's the radio?
[351:19.46]Can't I power this some other way?
[351:25.59]Take a picture of.
[351:30.19]Oh my God.
[351:41.76]Alright now, where's the wait wait?
[352:00.79]Oh No, oh no, I need to take a picture of this whole thing.
[352:06.63]Oh It's over I think it's over
[352:10.85]Boys and girls, it might be over right now.
[352:18.56]Oh, fuck off with this stupid horse shit.
[352:24.61]Oh, God damn it.
[352:25.79]This is really hard.
[352:42.68]Get these bushes out of my face.
[352:59.35]Okay.
[352:59.83]I'm going to take a picture of the radio.
[353:07.90]We're good.
[353:17.68]I gotta stop fucking laughing.
[353:19.01]Like, stop laughing.
[353:20.31]I... Get this shit away from me.
[353:35.08]I'm good.
[353:38.57]Okay.
[353:39.19]Everything's better.
[353:55.45]I just need two of these, that's it.
[354:28.42]I forgot.
[354:28.88]I forget.
[354:29.98]It's gone already.
[354:31.13]Why is it gone?
[354:32.03]I remember.
[354:57.33]I don't even need two of these.
[354:58.37]But I'm gonna take two because maybe the last level needs it.
[355:00.97]Alright, let's go.
[355:11.12]Plenty of time.
[355:13.22]Just use the radio.
[355:16.28]Boom.
[355:19.60]That shit is so far away.
[355:23.69]Oh, you're driving me fucking crazy with this.
[355:26.27]What?
[355:26.53]Just drop it.
[355:30.44]Okay, okay.
[355:31.12]Okay, okay.
[355:32.70]What was the point of that?
[355:34.32]Why did I just even do that?
[355:42.10]What?
[355:55.83]did it you did well thank god I understand I got I got it I got it everything's fine she was desperate to find the truth on her own but I see now there is no singular stuff that's not the perfect answer if anything meeting you in this place was the closest I would ever get to knowing
[356:22.83]the red world that awaits you.
[356:26.14]Is it loving?
[356:28.08]Is it healing?
[356:40.40]Ow!
[356:41.92]You didn't tell me there was physical force in these, man.
[356:44.98]This is the real final level, then.
[356:49.42]I beat the level already.
[357:08.97]You really get... I'm gonna get a Luigi text before I even get to try it?
[357:14.22]That's kind of... Ugh.
[357:16.98]Come on.
[357:45.74]That is.
[357:45.92]It's like the last plant on Earth or something.
[358:04.41]Don't drop it.
[358:14.50]You're back.
[358:15.60]Oh my god.
[358:16.56]You made it.
[358:18.60]I was worried.
[358:20.14]You went dark.
[358:22.04]Don't scare me like that.
[358:23.60]You probably need some rest.
[358:26.87]I guess it was too good to be true.
[358:30.29]A bummer for sure.
[358:33.41]But it's not the end.
[358:35.11]We can keep brainstorming other... Wait.
[358:40.49]What's that?
[358:40.99]I got the plant.
[358:52.75]What kind of plant was that?
[358:53.53]I did it.
[358:55.41]I got the good ending.
[359:01.63]Oh, that was great.
[359:10.64]That was a really fun game.
[359:14.06]I enjoyed that the whole way through.
[359:38.98]Should have taken the... Should have taken the kitty.
[359:42.42]Could you have?
[359:50.37]What's wrong with you?
[359:51.07]Most streamers beat this in 20 minutes.
[359:52.63]The opening cutscene and tutorial is 20 minutes.
[359:57.83]Nice try, though.
[360:09.70]Speedruns will be fun with this, though.
[360:12.25]People will break this.
[360:13.73]They'll take a picture of something like three times and crash it or something.
[360:32.28]There's a lot of levels.
[360:35.64]That third chapter had like 20 something levels, 22, 23.
[360:38.34]Any percent right now is 24 minutes.
[360:45.96]Jeez.
[360:46.18]That seems hard.
[361:04.97]Gonna do bouncing duck sim.
[361:07.15]Yeah, not tonight though.
[361:07.85]I think we've been live for a decent amount of time.
[361:22.83]I'll be live again on Monday.
[361:27.70]And Monday is an interesting day because
[361:35.16]Armored Core is an option, but so is Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[361:48.85]The U2s also launches on Monday.
[361:50.55]Well, it's for sale on Monday.
[361:52.67]I don't think it delivers for a month or two after that.
[361:59.12]But Bouncing Duck looks... That was a Poke recommendation.
[362:03.10]I looked it up.
[362:05.22]It looks pretty great.
[362:08.76]So we'll figure it out tomorrow.
[362:10.04]Or on Monday.
[362:17.97]And then later in the week after Monday.
[362:19.95]Probably on... Maybe Sunday?
[362:25.21]Friday?
[362:25.77]Sunday?
[362:26.05]I'll pick a day.
[362:28.15]We'll get back into Sorcery Part 4.
[362:33.32]Oh, no.
[362:33.68]You guys are right.
[362:35.64]I didn't save Kate.
[362:39.80]That's on me.
[362:40.34]That's my bad.
[362:47.15]Very cool.
[362:49.39]I give it a very, very, very fun out of 10.
[362:53.09]That was very good.
[362:54.65]Very enjoyable.
[362:58.61]Just the core gameplay mechanic alone is worth playing it.
[363:11.26]That's it.
[363:13.77]Perfect timing, I guess.
[363:23.29]People said this was a three-hour game and it was going to take you six hours.
[363:29.18]Yeah, but I feel like it... Even if you blow through every level, I feel like it would take you more than three hours.
[363:44.65]I did do the optional levels, too.
[363:46.15]Almost all of them.
[363:48.45]Which I'm sure that added at least 45 minutes to an hour.
[363:58.12]Pretty average playtime.
[364:01.20]Yeah, we also talk about ice cream and ketchup and mustard combinations.
[364:06.74]You always have to add the streamer one to two hour of I'm walking in a circle and talking.
[364:21.76]But, yeah.
[364:23.94]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[364:27.04]Gonna start with Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[364:32.84]And after... I might just play that the whole day.
[364:38.18]If I get over that or get bored of that, it might be an attempt of Armored Core 6.
[364:47.39]Either one of those two will be on Monday.
[364:49.01]And then later in the weekend we'll do sorcery.
[364:57.36]Thanks again.
[364:57.72]See you soon.
[364:59.16]Take care of yourselves.
[364:59.78]Get some sleep.
[365:06.04]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[365:17.79]Bye, even though mustard is dog shit.
[365:20.09]Hey, we can have different opinions.
[365:23.71]Yours is just wrong.
[365:26.95]Thanks for coming, though.
[365:34.55]I'm a mustard Andy, OK?
[365:45.18]That emote.
[365:46.58]How many emotes?
[365:47.86]I just.
[365:49.14]Why are these emotes even here?
[365:53.43]Does anybody think jermaMustard is still funny?
[365:57.49]From like 2016.
[366:10.68]That was, I don't know what to put for an emote slot.
[366:14.92]And there are subscriptions on the channel.
[366:17.29]I have to come up with something.
[366:19.79]I guess this is what it is.
[366:22.67]And then eight years went by and I added one or two more emotes.
[366:28.76]So it's all good.
[366:39.74]Honestly, I think the BTTV emotes just sort of took over.
[366:47.34]It was just, if something was, the mods was just added.
[366:49.97]That way everybody can just use them.
[366:58.69]Some of them, I think, deserve to be sub emotes, but a lot of them just should be BTTV.
[367:14.66]Alright, see you Monday.
[367:15.32]Take care.
[367:16.62]Call your mother.
[367:18.46]Drink some water.
[367:19.70]Get some sleep.
[367:27.33]Take care of yourself.
[367:37.84]In what order?
[367:39.50]Whatever order you are comfortable with.
[367:46.57]Good night.
[367:48.45]See you Monday.
[367:53.78]Take care.
[368:32.73]you
[369:07.59]you
