[ve:60.16.100]

[00:54.65]OK.
[01:00.21]I am back.
[01:02.15]I don't know if Ster is back.
[01:05.81]You change this.
[01:07.41]What should I make this?
[01:09.78]A cup of cooking.
[01:10.94]Cooking class.
[01:13.12]Cooking class with Ster.
[01:16.46]Hey, what's your title?
[01:17.90]Because I want it to be different than yours.
[01:23.23]My title is... Do you still talk to Jerma?
[01:27.55]I get that question a lot, so I'll just put in that title.
[01:43.44]How about, should I just make mine Ster and I are talking?
[01:47.68]Yeah, I think that'd be good.
[01:48.56]That'd be a good co-op title.
[01:49.58]I think that's fair, right?
[01:56.43]Not that pretty good.
[01:57.03]Okay.
[01:59.53]And then this is played up, right?
[02:01.81]Yeah, all one word, apparently.
[02:03.63]One word.
[02:04.05]Yeah.
[02:08.88]This has been on the whole time.
[02:09.82]I'm sorry, everybody.
[02:10.98]I am so ready to make a 2018 YouTube video.
[02:14.72]Are you?
[02:17.29]Wait up, let's go!
[02:18.23]So invite only, how do we, how do we, are you using a controller or a keyboard and mouse?
[02:23.93]I'd have to find a controller.
[02:25.10]I just did invite only.
[02:27.30]We don't know how to even play.
[02:31.24]Oh, hold on.
[02:33.66]do I like add hold on multiplayer oh invite friends uh there's there's a Twitch integration and options where the customers are chatters I think um options advanced Twitch integration opens the chef chef application which handles Twitch integration which my settings can be configured within chef I don't know if you want to
[03:01.57]Deal with that.
[03:04.71]This is asking a lot right now.
[03:08.01]It is asking a lot more than I thought it was.
[03:13.07]I have a new window.
[03:15.69]It's like a whole other application.
[03:17.89]Oh, no, no, no.
[03:20.01]I'm sorry.
[03:20.47]Guys, I haven't even played the game.
[03:23.40]I don't know what my Twitch password is.
[03:27.49]There's a lot of stuff.
[03:28.57]I don't know.
[03:29.61]Well, maybe at some point later.
[03:30.49]We have to figure out how to join each other's games.
[03:32.29]Can you join off me?
[03:32.99]Let me see if I can just invite you.
[03:44.48]I mean, are you hosting a game?
[03:46.20]I am right now.
[03:48.06]But it says like, oh, invite only.
[03:50.54]And it says invite friends.
[03:51.38]When I click it, nothing happens.
[03:56.84]Are you even online on Steam?
[03:58.27]Yeah.
[04:03.47]Your name is probably like Pancake Recipe or some shit.
[04:06.09]I got it.
[04:07.54]It's Jerma.
[04:09.54]What?
[04:10.70]It is.
[04:13.52]Wasn't your name like Ice Cream Sandwich in the last game?
[04:15.68]I mean, it was maybe.
[04:19.49]Wait, were you paying someone to play that game with me?
[04:23.88]And you were just reacting on camera?
[04:26.88]It's the new meta.
[04:31.14]Can you join the game or not?
[04:32.98]I don't think I can.
[04:34.16]I don't see a, like, join.
[04:38.43]How do we do this?
[04:40.85]Because I can't.
[04:41.73]When I click invite, maybe I should do the... Okay, wait, no, I'm in the tutorial.
[04:45.17]Oh, goodness.
[04:46.99]Do the tutorial.
[04:48.69]Okay.
[04:48.93]Oh.
[04:50.61]That's the problem.
[05:13.36]God, what have I done?
[05:14.06]Oh my god, I just exited this tutorial.
[05:18.44]Shit.
[05:19.95]Um, okay, hold on.
[05:24.47]Why can I not invite you?
[05:25.49]Okay, you make the game because my Steam overlay, like, is disabled.
[05:30.53]Do I have to do the tutorial?
[05:31.93]Because it has, like, a... Try making it invite only.
[05:35.55]Go to multiplayer, go to invite only, and invite friends.
[05:37.50]Because I think my Steam is off.
[05:43.34]What?
[05:44.38]Like, my Steam integration is, like, fucked up.
[05:46.72]When I click invite friends, nothing happens.
[05:49.24]Okay, this is also going to need a controller because the interact key is P. I'm using a controller.
[05:56.25]Hold on.
[05:58.59]I got to find a controller real quick.
[06:00.25]No.
[06:01.05]No.
[06:02.19]We could have just... I was enjoying Ember.
[06:04.03]I'm sorry that you played it for like four hours with me and didn't enjoy it for a moment.
[06:09.52]I did.
[06:09.96]We...
[06:17.23]Invite only was broken for me.
[06:18.65]Try something else.
[06:19.51]Really?
[06:19.87]Is that for real?
[06:26.25]Okay.
[06:32.31]Can you join off me now?
[06:36.87]I can look.
[06:37.39]I was looking for a controller.
[06:41.00]So this is broken.
[06:42.38]Somebody said in chat.
[06:49.94]Oh, you can just leave the tutorial.
[06:51.32]Yeah, that's what I did, but that means we're not going to know how to play the game.
[06:55.20]Yeah, we will.
[06:56.65]Okay.
[07:00.85]I have it set to private, so I wonder if you can just join me.
[07:10.74]There's a built-in invite.
[07:11.92]Yeah, I'm trying to do it.
[07:14.30]I did what you did.
[07:15.04]I couldn't get out of that.
[07:16.61]I did quick game.
[07:18.95]Calm down.
[07:19.63]There was nothing else to do.
[07:20.87]Okay, just relax.
[07:22.35]I'm relaxed.
[07:24.17]Maybe do that.
[07:24.61]I'm relaxed.
[07:26.23]Okay.
[07:27.79]Just go into your menu.
[07:30.83]Go and just see if you can join off of me from your Steam.
[07:35.06]Okay.
[07:37.34]It's okay.
[07:37.82]Multiplayer.
[07:38.60]Multiplayer.
[07:39.58]Just see if you can just join my game.
[07:42.26]No, there's only like... Hold on.
[07:48.24]Well, you broke it.
[07:49.88]I broke it?
[07:50.36]I can't even right-click your name on Steam right now.
[07:52.68]Something's wrong.
[07:54.12]What's today?
[07:55.36]What's today?
[07:56.50]Maintenance?
[07:58.40]It's Monday.
[08:01.34]My whole Steam friends list, I can't click any of it.
[08:09.22]Restart your computer.
[08:10.18]I'm not doing that.
[08:12.32]You need to invite through the plate up options.
[08:14.62]The Steam overlay does not work.
[08:18.80]Yeah, I'm in the plate up options.
[08:21.22]Multiplayer and invite friends doesn't work.
[08:23.96]I can't click it.
[08:26.26]When I click it, it just goes.
[08:27.18]Yeah, I'll show you.
[08:31.66]I'll show you.
[08:34.73]By black screen.
[08:35.45]I don't know.
[08:36.17]Just in case it's like a lobby code or something.
[08:37.91]I don't know.

[09:16.09]Okay.
[09:21.72]Okay, so should we do the tutorial?
[09:27.10]Yeah, the buttons for this game, I couldn't find a controller and the buttons seem insane.
[09:33.63]Oh?
[09:33.79]Do you want to play the tutorial?
[09:36.51]Yes.
[09:41.39]Press grab while looking at the fish to take the fish.
[09:46.48]Place the fish.
[09:47.14]Stop touching things.
[09:48.66]Okay.
[09:50.72]Place the fish on the hob to start cooking.
[10:03.43]Combine the fish with the plate once a customer has arrived and chosen their meal.
[10:10.82]Interact to take their order.
[10:12.62]Okay.
[10:15.28]There's no customer.
[10:20.01]You can now see their order above their head.
[10:21.79]Place it on their table.
[10:22.64]They want a blank plate?
[10:26.76]Oh, why was it looking?
[10:29.44]Yeah, I looked at it that way too.
[10:31.22]I just want a plate.
[10:32.42]Yeah, like I'm not hungry.
[10:35.36]Customers won't sit at the table with something on it.
[10:37.36]Once they leave, grab the dirty plate.
[10:40.40]Put it in the sink.
[10:43.52]I had a question before we continue any further.
[10:46.78]So when you're streaming...
[10:49.28]And you go to the bathroom.
[10:51.80]Are you not trying to finish the bathroom as quickly as possible?
[10:54.27]Or like, are you in your sanctuary and you're like on your phone watching a stream while your stream is live waiting for you to come back?
[11:00.59]Well, here's the thing.
[11:02.31]I have never taken a shit in the middle of a stream ever.
[11:08.45]Not one time.
[11:09.53]The entire time I've ever been on Twitch.
[11:12.35]So you would just end the stream before you would do that?
[11:14.52]Yes.
[11:15.04]I would either go to the bathroom before or after.
[11:18.00]I would never do it during a stream because it would take way too long.
[11:23.51]Okay.
[11:24.54]And plus, I don't know, look, when you're sitting there, and you're taking a shit, don't you just, isn't it in your mind, you're just thinking of all the people that are leaving your stream?
[11:36.69]It's like, dude, it's been like 10 minutes, like, where is this guy?
[11:41.29]I'm out of here, and I'm just sitting there, like, I'd be kind of panicking.
[11:44.62]Yeah, but it's gotta happen sometimes.
[11:47.96]It's never happened.
[11:50.83]People always ask why I'm late, or why the stream starts so late, or... Oh, dude, you said two, but then you said three.
[11:56.51]Because I need to make sure that all liquids and solids are out of my body completely before I turn the stream on.
[12:05.26]Empty.
[12:05.86]Zero.
[12:06.64]Empty, empty, empty.
[12:08.36]That's a rough life.
[12:10.62]How?
[12:11.10]Why?
[12:11.36]Because I don't want to have to do that in the middle of the stream?
[12:14.61]Like, everybody else in their jobs, they get to go to the bathroom.
[12:19.97]It's not like you're allowed to go to the bathroom.
[12:23.29]But I know how my bathroom habits are.
[12:26.15]And even if I hurry, it will be 15 to 20 minutes.
[12:29.47]How do I cut?
[12:41.96]Oh, fries.
[12:45.98]Do you chug coffee, like, beforehand?
[12:47.79]Yes.
[12:49.07]I drink coffee all the time.
[12:49.99]Get him his fries!
[12:54.95]He wants fish and fries.
[13:06.86]I got a heart.
[13:11.68]Place a plate in a sink.
[13:13.06]Oh, I can't.
[13:13.57]Why not?
[13:16.22]Oh, we have to wash the dish and then get it out.
[13:22.77]These sound effects are kind of loud and annoying for me.
[13:24.69]Are they for you?
[13:25.97]A little bit.
[13:27.09]There's always like a, you know, you can lower the volume.
[13:29.13]Yeah, let me do that.
[13:35.85]Okay.
[13:36.71]Groups expect all their meals to arrive together.
[13:38.76]When they're ready, take their order.
[13:40.24]You got it.
[13:43.00]Oh, you got it.
[13:48.68]Oh, I wonder what they're gonna want.
[13:50.22]A fish or a french fry?
[13:52.61]Oh, you beast!
[13:58.15]What?
[14:04.36]Oh, wait, you didn't want fries.
[14:05.50]Wait, these are on the house.
[14:12.23]Survive as many days as possible.
[14:17.88]Okay, that's pretty, that's pretty hardcore.
[14:22.69]If a patience bar runs up, okay, we know what to do.
[14:25.53]Why are you minus twoing me?
[14:27.03]We can't get one bad review on Yelp.
[14:31.29]You should be striving for that as a business.
[14:34.73]What would you guys rate my stream?
[14:36.96]Let's get a poll up.
[14:39.62]Between one and five.
[14:45.54]You made a bad joke.
[14:46.68]I didn't make a joke.
[14:47.41]I just said a word.
[14:48.33]I said one word.
[14:54.63]Alright, take this order.
[15:04.66]Imagine somebody's just sitting there with a cooked fish.
[15:07.10]Just like, so what are you going to order tonight?
[15:09.88]Like, I don't know.
[15:10.91]I was thinking about the soup.
[15:13.91]Smell this thing?
[15:14.63]You think this looks good?
[15:19.11]Okay, so we need to take a portion of mashed potatoes.
[15:24.26]Okay.
[15:34.84]Oh, we can buy stuff, too.
[15:36.74]How many days do we make it?
[15:37.82]You think we make it to day two?
[15:41.69]Five.
[15:46.35]Okay, cool.
[15:47.61]Cool.
[15:48.39]Cool.
[15:48.85]Five.
[15:48.99]Okay, what's the name of a restaurant?
[15:55.19]Um... Oil and Char.
[16:03.48]Oil and... That sounds disgusting.
[16:10.59]Does it?
[16:11.67]How do we start?
[16:14.09]Complete the plan to begin.
[16:15.81]Okay, so we need to go to the city.
[16:19.39]Oh.
[16:19.47]Put the floor plan there.
[16:21.73]Okay.
[16:22.51]And then the menu is steak.
[16:24.45]We have steak.
[16:26.22]Okay.
[16:26.62]Add oil and char.
[16:27.96]Oil and char.
[16:28.60]Ready.
[16:32.04]Ready.
[16:34.23]I think you have to get over here.
[16:39.27]Yeah, I don't know if we're getting day two.
[16:41.28]I think we get to day three.
[16:46.02]Cook steak once for rare, twice for medium, and three times for well done.
[16:52.15]Okay.
[16:54.17]What is happening?
[16:54.81]Why are we losing progress?
[16:58.77]Alright, here we go!
[17:00.19]Okay, we need rolls.
[17:01.65]Rolls.
[17:02.33]Behind the counter, start cooking a steak.
[17:03.97]I'll take the orders.
[17:05.39]You take the orders.
[17:06.29]I will take the orders.
[17:07.23]You start the food.
[17:08.37]Don't move the fridge.
[17:10.12]I just... Start day.
[17:12.30]We press K. Okay.
[17:14.58]Are we ready?
[17:15.22]It's Y. I thought you had a controller.
[17:18.54]No, I don't.
[17:20.94]It's tough times, dude.
[17:22.84]Okay.
[17:23.04]Are you ready?
[17:24.26]I'm ready.
[17:25.28]The name of the restaurant is High Stakes.
[17:27.89]It's the first level.
[17:29.19]It's gonna be like three people are gonna come in.
[17:31.73]No, no, no, it's not gonna be okay.
[17:33.22]Alright, so why am I taking orders?
[17:34.58]They're gonna want a steak.
[17:35.44]That's it.
[17:35.78]Okay, what would you like?
[17:38.36]I would like a steak.
[17:39.42]Oh, I wonder.
[17:40.10]Okay.
[17:42.18]What do you want to doneness?
[17:45.46]Okay, that's what they want.
[17:46.26]They want it like that.
[17:46.82]Take it off!
[17:48.33]Get it off.
[17:48.67]Get it.
[17:48.89]Go, go, go, go.
[17:51.37]Here you are.
[17:53.73]Hey, you can't sit in the heat, and you better stay out of the kitchen.
[17:55.79]Clean that up.
[17:56.49]I told you this was going to be so easy.
[17:58.29]Clean that up, you little baby bus boy.
[18:04.15]Yeah, you got to earn a position.
[18:06.35]How much water did you just knock on the floor?
[18:09.36]I didn't.
[18:09.66]Alright, what do you want?
[18:11.16]Let me guess.
[18:12.54]Oh, they want a... I think that's well done.
[18:14.94]You already have one halfway there.
[18:17.32]Wait, what is this?
[18:19.82]Oh, that's just a bonus one.
[18:21.73]Here, I got them.
[18:22.87]How do you clean?
[18:33.06]Oh, okay.
[18:33.42]You have to hold X to clean.
[18:37.08]I don't see you doing anything.
[18:38.14]I was... You're going to take his order?
[18:43.10]We don't even need to.
[18:44.06]We know what it is.
[18:44.74]Is it going to be steak?
[18:46.72]It's a medium and a well-done steak.
[18:51.40]This one needs to go back on.
[18:53.58]You can't because it's already on the plate.
[18:54.97]What?
[18:59.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:00.41]Take it off.
[19:00.77]Take it off.
[19:08.12]This guy wants a steak.
[19:19.50]Take that one off!
[19:19.92]Take that one off!
[19:20.46]Take that one off!
[19:22.66]This one's burnt.
[19:24.16]I'm cleaning.

[20:54.78]You can't do that.

[21:13.82]You want to make this efficient, then that's what we can do.
[21:19.14]And the storage will just be in here.
[21:24.92]Research desk.
[21:26.86]I feel like we had good flow.
[21:30.72]What is this heat sign that is next to these tables?
[21:35.24]I think it's just decreased patience.
[21:37.74]I think today they don't have a lot of patience.
[21:41.87]That's, like, prepare for this because people really want their food quick today.
[21:46.46]And you just took a seat away from that.
[21:50.34]Okay.
[21:50.74]Ready?
[21:52.64]I... Wait, hold on, hold on.
[21:53.46]We can buy one of these.
[21:54.54]What's the work boots?
[21:58.60]We can buy an extra sink.
[21:59.58]Okay, we don't want none of this.
[22:01.68]Unless you want an extra dining table for more people.
[22:04.50]We can buy that.
[22:05.64]We're in level two.
[22:06.22]It's not gonna happen.
[22:06.90]Okay.
[22:07.28]Yeah, okay.
[22:07.68]Let's start.
[22:08.84]Start day?
[22:09.89]Yep.
[22:12.49]I remember if we lose one day we die they actually pull us out back and execute us just get some food going okay we got one that one and then one well why did you take that one off because that wait for that one to be well then we're good okay on the plate plate it up there it is 10 bucks okay clean this ship
[22:43.40]all the way in the other room.
[22:45.50]That's fine.
[22:45.86]Alright.
[22:46.74]I will take care of this.
[22:47.52]You, you, I will do this.
[22:49.32]Go and leave.
[22:58.44]This is like, nothing's happening yet.
[23:00.12]And it's already stressful.
[23:05.40]Behind.
[23:07.41]Get that, get that off.
[23:08.39]Get that off.
[23:09.09]Blade it.

[23:19.25]I'm cleaning.
[23:20.59]Two more on the grill!
[23:22.79]Okay, wait, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:23.83]Let's, like, farm these guys.
[23:25.53]What do you mean?
[23:26.58]They don't need... Like, we have plenty of time before we can take their order.
[23:29.92]If we don't know what they want for steaks, take them off!
[23:31.90]We don't know what they want!
[23:32.88]We don't know what they want for steaks!
[23:34.78]This is two mediums.
[23:36.98]You fucking donkey!
[23:43.26]Get it off!
[23:45.02]Let's go.
[23:47.88]Oh my god, oh my god, you fucking- No, you put it on!
[23:51.30]You put it on!
[23:51.76]You doink!

[24:01.25]Oh my god, I can't believe you got that.
[24:03.49]What?!
[24:05.07]Yeah, we fucked up, dude.
[24:08.19]Actually, it looked like- I don't know, it was milliseconds.
[24:15.35]Okay, so we're good.
[24:17.27]Wait, we did?
[24:17.87]No, it's restarting that day.
[24:20.59]Alright.
[24:21.05]Well, this didn't work.
[24:25.55]I was hoping it would kick us back to the beginning.
[24:30.04]I did not like the kitchen set up at all, by the way.
[24:33.52]Someone was outside, you donkey.
[24:36.94]What do we do about that?
[24:38.02]Who cares?
[24:40.08]I don't know.
[24:44.09]Do we have a seed?
[24:47.22]I believe so there's a seed that's interesting get need to clear the table oh we needed to clear the table okay this is a rogue light okay what I I okay that's kind of cool alright let's go
[25:08.89]I was interested in this game because it's like it's not like the other games like Overcooked are all like individual puzzles.
[25:14.45]This one was like, they murder you.
[25:17.01]But didn't we just lose?
[25:18.27]How come we're able to do it again?
[25:20.61]I don't know.
[25:21.13]Okay, well, let's let's go.
[25:25.74]It's just stakes.
[25:26.58]Just don't screw it up.
[25:27.60]It's we just have to not be idiots.
[25:30.13]Oh, it's after three days.
[25:31.07]Okay.
[25:31.23]The first three days.
[25:31.85]Okay.
[25:32.66]Oh, first three days are free.
[25:34.22]Yeah.
[25:34.48]Okay.
[25:34.74]Alright.
[25:35.14]Let's go.
[25:35.52]So you're ready?
[25:36.18]Okay.
[25:36.36]Alright.
[25:37.10]We need to have actual roles.
[25:38.94]I will be the cleaner and the, uh, I'll get, I'll get the plates.
[25:43.72]I'll do the cleaning.
[25:44.64]I'll clean up the ground.
[25:46.06]You handle the meat because I don't, I will, but same thing will happen like last time.
[25:50.06]I'll put one on when you're screaming at me.
[25:52.04]Okay.
[25:52.26]Take the order.
[25:52.72]Okay.
[25:53.74]That we need a one.
[25:54.66]Well, one medium.
[26:01.05]Exactly.
[26:01.41]Perfect.
[26:02.29]Get out of the doorway.
[26:03.85]Let me deliver it.
[26:05.95]Let me deliver it.
[26:07.37]Alright.
[26:07.75]Okay.
[26:08.07]Okay.
[26:08.29]Okay.
[26:08.47]Okay.
[26:08.67]Okay.
[26:09.00]Okay.
[26:09.26]You're right.
[26:09.64]You're right.
[26:09.96]You're right.
[26:10.24]You're right.
[26:10.54]You're right.
[26:11.70]See?
[26:12.20]Now you can do this.
[26:13.22]This is how you're supposed to do it.
[26:15.66]Yes.
[26:17.72]Isn't that like not fair?
[26:19.02]We only have one sink.
[26:22.86]Okay.
[26:23.08]We need two mediums.
[26:30.98]Very good.
[26:33.81]Two mediums.
[26:34.27]Got plenty of time.
[26:40.41]Okay.
[26:41.83]Incoming.
[26:42.33]We need one medium, one... I don't know what that is.
[26:46.33]One medium, one well.
[26:52.31]Okay.
[26:52.51]I'll wash this.
[26:53.01]I'll wash.
[26:53.27]There's going to be a second.
[26:54.09]Can you entertain them?
[26:56.37]I'll wash.
[26:56.75]I'll wash.
[26:57.01]I'll wash.
[26:57.75]Okay.
[26:57.93]Okay.
[27:05.67]One well, one medium.
[27:10.23]We're down.
[27:14.39]Now we need one well, one medium again.
[27:15.94]I will do the dishes here.
[27:18.08]You just pick it.
[27:19.00]You clean.
[27:19.60]I mean, you cook.
[27:21.58]What?
[27:21.78]I'm doing everything?
[27:22.76]You cook, you clean.
[27:27.43]You do everything.
[27:28.21]Hey, just do everything, and I'm going to just stand around.
[27:39.10]What kind of monsters?
[27:43.71]Why are you standing still?
[27:44.97]You were just standing still.
[27:48.43]The day's over, dude.
[27:50.99]It's like four minutes before closing and you're like, you could be cleaning.
[27:56.65]You know that we have the auto clean end of the day imaginary auto clean restaurant.
[28:01.64]I actually didn't know that.
[28:05.34]Can you fill up our loading bar faster?
[28:08.94]Okay, we got a lot of money now.
[28:11.72]So what we got?
[28:12.36]How much do we have?
[28:13.64]We got eight extra plates.
[28:15.96]We don't have a lot of plates.
[28:17.16]I like that.
[28:17.90]That sounds great.
[28:18.63]That feels like too many plates.
[28:20.23]I need that many plates.
[28:21.79]No, that's going to be too many.
[28:23.59]They're going to be on the ground and scattered.
[28:26.35]Watch what happens.
[28:29.17]Can't place it in this corner.
[28:31.39]How can we sound like you have a joint hit in your lungs?
[28:35.39]I can't place it anywhere.
[28:36.81]It's because I'm 40.
[28:37.47]Oh, I'm pressing the wrong button.
[28:40.49]That's our plate room.
[28:42.75]A plate room?
[28:44.83]You don't have a plate room?
[28:46.69]Actually, that's not a bad place for it.
[28:48.95]That's a huge stack.
[28:50.99]I told you this is too much.
[28:51.99]Because now we have 12 plates.
[28:55.01]A research grant?
[28:57.11]What is a research grant?
[28:58.20]Let's take this and figure out what it is.
[29:00.10]Upgrade a blueprint.
[29:01.06]What does it do?
[29:05.56]There's our potions if you need any potions over here.
[29:09.34]What does this actually do?
[29:11.76]I don't know.
[29:12.34]I think it's researched so we get better stuff later.
[29:15.04]So presumably we can cook more than just freaking steaks and we make more money.
[29:18.06]I assume.
[29:20.36]We got no more money.
[29:22.08]Hold to carry two items at once.
[29:25.32]My ears just rang when I did that.
[29:26.72]I'm not doing that again.
[29:29.50]My ears are ringing.
[29:31.48]Okay, you ready?
[29:34.48]I'm ready.
[29:36.54]We've got more plates than we have chairs.
[29:40.64]What idiot bought all these plates?
[29:42.00]Okay, they're going to want steaks.
[29:50.61]We got a medium and a raw.
[29:55.45]Medium and raw.
[29:58.19]That's not correct.
[29:59.19]Oh.
[29:59.31]No!
[30:06.46]What are you doing?
[30:08.02]Ah, you actually just ruined it.
[30:10.51]I... It's still day three.
[30:17.59]It's good.
[30:18.71]With the tutorial.
[30:23.49]You don't have to put them on the table until they're all ready, though.
[30:26.92]So maybe that was actually your fault.
[30:28.80]You didn't cook it right.
[30:30.12]Wait, we didn't buy everything again.
[30:32.18]Do you want me to do the cooking and you can do the placement stuff?
[30:37.50]Do you think you can handle it?
[30:39.00]What was the... I can handle... It's the easiest job in the restaurant.
[30:45.72]Do you think you deserve to be the chef?
[30:49.10]Yeah, let's see.
[30:49.74]Go.
[30:50.68]Go.
[30:51.58]Go.
[30:52.00]Go.
[30:53.22]You didn't buy your plates yet.
[30:54.42]You were so into that.
[30:55.42]You don't need the plate.
[30:56.52]You're the chef.
[30:57.96]I'll be fine.
[30:59.20]Alright.
[30:59.84]Let's go.
[31:01.80]Let's show you how it's done.
[31:05.59]Okay.
[31:05.73]I want you to call out...
[31:07.39]L, M, H. L is raw.
[31:11.39]M is medium.
[31:11.99]H is high.
[31:12.43]I honestly don't understand what the shades are.
[31:15.91]Low, medium, high.
[31:18.47]M, H. See?
[31:26.27]So, are you guys celebrating anything?
[31:29.47]Is any of your birthdays today?
[31:32.43]Anyone celebrating anything today?
[31:34.09]You're going to come get the food?
[31:36.38]Can you fucking let me do my job?
[31:42.30]Call it out, please.
[31:47.11]Uh, LM.
[31:48.91]See?
[31:49.19]Look at that.
[31:53.83]Let me do my job!
[32:08.02]Oh my God, that we can't open that door if someone sits there.
[32:12.05]Hey, hey, hey, I need some orders.
[32:13.93]Uh, L. There's already one there for you.
[32:15.61]The fucker.
[32:18.61]Oh no, I didn't mean, I didn't, I can't.
[32:21.00]Sorry.
[32:29.18]The plates are piling up, friend.
[32:35.08]What do they want?
[32:35.66]Any orders?
[32:36.24]I have an order.
[32:37.36]I don't have to ask them yet.
[32:39.92]You put them on.
[32:40.86]I can't drop this plate.
[32:42.62]I cannot drop this plate.
[32:44.04]We need more counter space.
[32:48.01]We need more counter space.
[32:48.91]Does anybody want this?
[32:51.29]I can't put this down anywhere.
[32:52.79]I cannot put this down anywhere.
[32:55.47]Okay, just...
[33:00.50]Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come! Come! Come! Come!
[33:08.89]You had a-
[33:11.15]You have the calmest job dude.
[33:13.76]Just clean.
[33:14.74]We need another counter. We need another counter.
[33:19.22]I distinctly remember a secnario where you didn't come pick the food.
[33:24.00]Don't start the meals until I take the order.
[33:27.18]Yeah, and you were... I don't know what you were doing.
[33:29.22]You were like walking around in this room.
[33:30.86]We have time.
[33:31.66]Circling in circles.
[33:33.12]I was trying to put plates down.
[33:35.04]Dude, did you see... Run back the stream.
[33:38.14]Run the stream back.
[33:39.20]You were going like this.
[33:40.30]You did this for like 50 straight seconds.
[33:41.28]Yeah, because I couldn't put the plate down.
[33:42.26]I was panicking.
[33:44.06]I was trying to think of what to do.
[33:48.62]Do you want more plates after that shit?
[33:52.68]We need another counter.
[33:54.17]I want another counter.
[33:59.18]I don't think we have another counter.
[34:00.30]We would have to re-roll.
[34:01.16]There's a re-roll blueprint out here.
[34:03.04]Alright, we'll be alright.
[34:04.12]Let's go for it.
[34:07.94]You just spent 10 bucks doing that.
[34:10.10]Yeah, we fucking needed it.
[34:11.82]No, it's F-U-C-K.
[34:14.42]Come on.
[34:14.92]Come on.
[34:18.02]When's the specials menu?
[34:19.99]The fuck is a portioner?
[34:28.84]Hey, we can get breadsticks.
[34:31.18]Let's get these breadsticks.
[34:32.28]Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[34:34.04]Alright, I'm going to... Yeah.
[34:36.59]Right there.
[34:37.63]Yeah.
[34:44.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[34:45.01]How do you pick them up?
[34:46.83]There's two buttons on the game.
[34:48.19]Try one.
[34:49.21]I want to put the breadsticks out here because they fit snugly in that corner.
[34:53.32]What is this?
[34:53.76]Take your own breadsticks?
[34:55.32]No, I am the breadstick man.
[34:58.74]it's my responsibility if you want me out of the kitchen then the breadsticks are on me because they're already made okay ready are you ready I'm ready let's go are you feeling comfortable yeah here wait wait wait let me move uh because that was blocking the door up here we gotta at least get to day five okay this is easy
[35:25.49]just make sure make sure you're not cooking things before people even show up and I haven't taken their order yet yeah oh uh lm oh interesting very interesting and what were you yelling at me when I was the chef I was I was pre I was pre-firing I'm saying shouldn't shouldn't I be the one to take the plates out if you're the one cooking and we need to clean those plates and you didn't even give breadsticks to our customers
[36:02.96]Alright, we're good.
[36:04.00]I breadsticked them.
[36:04.82]We are good to go.
[36:05.38]Worst fucking kitchen I've ever seen deleted by nightclubs.
[36:11.03]LH, LH, LH.
[36:15.37]LH?
[36:16.79]Yep.
[36:20.42]L.
[36:23.05]I'll put it down when you have the H. One more.
[36:25.95]One more step.
[36:26.41]One more step on that.
[36:27.01]What?
[36:27.19]What?
[36:27.47]What?
[36:27.81]What happened?
[36:28.37]Oh, no.
[36:28.67]Oh, my God.
[36:28.99]I'm so sorry.
[36:29.41]See, it's a good thing that I respect it that you're an idiot and I didn't put the L down before you made an H properly.
[36:36.26]Go cheer that person up.
[36:37.10]I think they said.
[36:38.88]No, they want to come in here, but we have no tables.
[36:43.43]Okay.
[36:46.39]Oh, my God, I can't.
[36:47.57]There's breadsticks on the table.
[36:48.25]There's breadsticks on the table.
[36:49.81]They're not eating them.
[36:50.49]What the fuck is this?
[36:51.33]Why did they not eat them?
[36:52.47]They're just staring at them.
[36:55.72]It has to go on the other side.
[36:56.66]Okay, what does that person want?
[36:59.92]A big fat L. How did we lose?
[37:04.32]I think because the guy couldn't come into the store.
[37:08.33]I don't understand what the breadsticks did.
[37:10.15]They didn't eat them.
[37:11.05]They didn't touch them.
[37:13.57]And I still had to take them off.
[37:18.82]I don't know.
[37:19.92]That's my fault.
[37:20.62]I timed it wrong.
[37:22.20]I pulled it too early.
[37:25.13]You are so bad.
[37:27.23]L. Here, this will make this easier.
[37:31.63]You know what is messing me up here?
[37:32.93]I'm doing some movement.
[37:38.00]I don't like the corner here.
[37:40.82]I want it in a row like this.
[37:43.04]Here, look how clean this is now.
[37:45.64]We've never had a table of four.
[37:47.68]This is so much better for my brain, rather than this little corner bullshit.
[37:50.97]Get it out of here.
[37:52.21]This is so much better for me.
[37:55.29]I hate this door.
[37:56.25]Because if I'm coming in to pick up plates, it, like, fights me.
[38:01.23]Why can't we just delete it?
[38:03.23]Alright, you ready?
[38:03.91]Let's just... We don't even need to do any upgrades.
[38:06.01]Just bank the money.
[38:07.77]Yeah, ready?
[38:08.51]Yep.
[38:10.03]Well, I got an extra table, so people won't get stuck outside anymore.
[38:15.40]Wow, nice day, Chef.
[38:16.27]Looks like you're ready to cook a steak.
[38:17.73]I'm waiting for you to take the order.
[38:18.73]I'm taking your criticism.
[38:20.19]I can't.
[38:24.51]Two L's, Chef.
[38:26.57]Yes, Chef.
[38:31.54]I got the door for you.
[38:36.06]Three, two, one.
[38:37.40]Here you go.
[38:39.54]Perfect, perfect.
[38:40.82]Well executed.

[39:39.80]Yes, chef.
[39:40.26]One L, one M. Cleaning up the floor for you.
[39:43.08]Is it L and M?
[39:44.84]L, M. Oh, how's it going, guys?
[39:50.59]You guys been in town long?

[40:00.62]Happy birthday.
[40:02.02]It's your birthday.
[40:03.26]It's your birthday.
[40:04.50]What do you guys want?
[40:05.16]One L, one M?
[40:15.16]I need a plate.
[40:17.30]I got one order.

[40:26.27]Done.
[40:26.73]Alright.
[40:27.01]Delicious.
[40:28.09]Cook, serve, delicious.
[40:33.23]I think that's it, right?
[40:34.99]Should be.
[40:36.03]So why are you cleaning?
[40:38.31]Because, like, I like to keep my hands busy.
[40:40.37]If I stop for a second, then I think, like, my engine just stops.
[40:43.80]And it's kind of like a shark that's not swimming.
[40:45.54]I'd fucking die.
[40:48.70]You know what?
[40:49.02]Yeah, you're making a joke, but that... I actually feel that a lot of the time.
[40:55.46]Yeah, I'm a shark.
[40:56.54]That's right.
[40:57.04]I'm the alpha.
[40:57.62]Wait, what are we looking at here?
[40:58.89]Your mushroom is an advantage to the next training.
[41:01.67]It's an upgrade.
[41:04.41]Steak sauce mushrooms.
[41:06.39]Adds mushroom sauce as a topping.
[41:10.68]Was that minus 15% people?
[41:13.60]I don't know.
[41:13.88]What does that mean guys?
[41:24.29]That means less customers per day.
[41:27.80]Let's do that.
[41:28.34]That sounds great, but we need to make a mushroom sauce.
[41:30.62]You think we're ready for that?
[41:31.96]Yeah, I'm ready.
[41:32.46]I mean, you're the chef.
[41:33.08]Are you ready for that chef?
[41:35.19]yeah alright let's get it chef press x or whatever the button is on your computer uh you have to select one of these and hit like x it's not showing me a button to press oh there we go that's weird okay we got a lot of money a lot of money rolling in very successful business okay add onion and water
[42:05.35]oh my god water boil and make and then put chopped mushrooms over it okay that's like that's like two ingredients water onions and then oh my god we have no space for this uh I think before the day starts we can enter practice mode so you can make one first we because now now we're in like uh yeah we're in like the lose the game territory yes now we got pots
[42:31.91]We have mushrooms, there's onions.
[42:34.25]Where do we want these?
[42:35.53]I'm going to put the pots down by the plates.
[42:37.27]I feel like that makes sense.
[42:41.09]We can move, we can run faster.
[42:42.53]Alright, let's do practice.
[42:46.76]Because I don't, I'm not confident.
[42:49.52]Wait, was there a run faster one?
[42:51.30]It's 60 bucks, but we can move faster.
[42:53.28]100% doing that.
[42:58.44]Oh wow, you do run faster.
[43:02.42]Alright, we need to try this.
[43:03.86]Okay.
[43:05.93]Yeah.
[43:11.79]Okay.
[43:13.71]So we need a pot?
[43:15.89]Why are there cats coming in?
[43:18.09]Uh... Who doesn't like cats?
[43:21.52]Okay, so boil the pot of water, put it in onion.
[43:25.06]Well, they don't want it, but just figure out how to make it.
[43:28.78]So there's onions.
[43:30.80]That goes in the pot?
[43:38.39]This water's not boiling.
[43:41.61]How do we put the onions in?
[43:42.51]How do we put the ingredients in?
[43:47.17]Don't chop them.
[43:48.44]Wait, you don't chop?
[43:50.30]No chop.
[43:52.12]Oh, okay.
[43:52.84]So one onion.
[43:54.00]Onion and water makes the broth.
[43:57.50]And then we take the mushroom.
[44:02.20]Does the mushroom need to be cut up?
[44:04.63]I don't think you can even chop the mushrooms.
[44:06.81]But did you already cut this?
[44:07.45]You can.
[44:07.93]That one's already cut.
[44:08.73]Okay.
[44:11.71]So that, this is done.
[44:13.80]And then you said this one's cut already.
[44:16.56]So do we add this?
[44:17.28]So now that, a chopped mushroom goes in.
[44:20.20]And then that makes that.
[44:25.90]And now we have this and we can put it on like a plate?
[44:32.68]okay so if somebody wants a steak with that mushroom sauce we just have to go up to it and press like the action button here try that there's no steak I think you gotta put that on top of the steak okay so then go and get the sauce on it okay okay here's what we do then here's the play what's the play right as soon as the day starts or even if it lets you do it before we prep the soup we prep
[45:00.00]Then just leave that on the side.
[45:01.28]We should prep two of them.
[45:03.04]Have just a bunch of it.
[45:04.56]I don't think we have enough counters to prep two.
[45:06.50]Otherwise, we're not going to be able to put plates anywhere.
[45:09.21]I agree.
[45:10.17]Okay, yeah.
[45:10.59]So let's make a broth in the morning.
[45:14.69]And then after the broth is made, then we open the store.
[45:16.59]Okay.
[45:18.23]Yeah, that sounds good.
[45:19.27]I agree with that.
[45:25.58]Do you need help making the broth?
[45:27.56]I think I got it.
[45:32.35]Okay.
[45:32.69]You ready?
[45:33.73]Hold on.
[45:34.51]Let me start making it.
[45:36.84]I'm not sure if starting the day... Oh, we have to start the day first.
[45:40.96]Yeah.
[45:41.40]So you got everything in your brain ready what you need to do.
[45:45.66]Yep.
[45:47.08]Yeah.
[45:49.69]Yeah, chef.
[45:52.65]Yep.
[45:52.85]Yep.
[46:01.38]Mushroom.
[46:08.12]How long until they get annoyed?
[46:10.86]Was the mushroom supposed to be chopped?
[46:12.48]Yeah.
[46:13.71]Then this goes in.
[46:16.05]We need another burner.
[46:16.97]Okay, that's going in and then this is going to be done.
[46:19.09]Oh, I see.
[46:20.37]Okay, I'm going to take the order.
[46:21.23]Take the order.
[46:21.93]What do you want?
[46:23.25]An L and an H with sauce.
[46:27.00]Okay.
[46:27.82]L and then H with sauce.
[46:31.44]Alright, take the L when it's here.
[46:34.54]You take the fucking L. Okay.
[46:36.84]Don't give... Do not!
[46:38.34]What?
[46:39.00]Because then it's the timer before you can place the fucking... We good?
[46:47.95]Ah, shit!
[46:48.41]We're good.
[46:48.79]We're fine.
[46:49.47]That was a delicious scrumptious meal, and they just enjoyed it.
[46:52.91]Taking the order.
[46:55.15]Uh, H with sauce.
[46:56.25]Dude, these fuckers.
[46:57.71]They want all this sauce.
[46:59.63]On an H. It takes so long to fucking cook and they just want it now.
[47:02.41]Don't take the other order.
[47:08.19]M with sauce.
[47:09.34]Okay.
[47:14.16]Okay.
[47:20.48]M with sauce.
[47:21.68]Yep.
[47:32.57]Okay.
[47:33.55]Taking the orc.
[47:34.82]Good.
[47:36.76]Uh, L with sauce and then L. Okay.
[47:50.04]L with sauce, L. Well done.
[47:55.65]Uh, two M's.
[47:58.59]That's medium, right?
[47:59.93]I think that's, I think that's well done.
[48:04.56]I don't... No, that's well done.
[48:07.54]Two H-ies.
[48:08.56]Can you grab that one?
[48:11.08]Grab that H-ie.
[48:18.15]And whoop, whoop, here it comes!
[48:22.27]Is the sauce good for more than one day?
[48:23.53]I think that was pretty clean.
[48:29.86]It was good.
[48:30.34]Somebody said, what the fuck, why aren't they fighting anymore?
[48:33.97]Uh, because we found that it's better to cooperate.
[48:37.30]We found, you know, our flow, what works for us.
[48:42.74]If my server did that, I wouldn't return.
[48:46.24]But spin around and be like, whoa, whoa.
[48:49.45]I think that I think that I added something to the atmosphere.
[48:52.89]worth coming back for.
[48:53.87]But you don't think it'd be funny if like the server walked out with a big plate of food nice and hot and did a I'm going to pass it underneath the leg kind of like a basketball and grab it with the other hand and pick it up.
[49:07.01]You don't think that'd be funny?
[49:09.90]Chef, look at this.
[49:10.92]Look at this one down here.
[49:12.02]This one you might want to consider here, Chef.
[49:13.90]We can afford the gas override.
[49:15.62]So what does this do?
[49:17.30]Cooks faster, burns faster.
[49:20.46]I feel like that's terrifying.
[49:22.89]Is that a little too scary?
[49:23.71]Do we even have a garbage, by the way?
[49:27.07]That's the kind of thing you do if there's four people in here.
[49:30.43]I don't know if this is a two person upgrade.
[49:34.04]What is this filing cabinet?
[49:41.46]Oh, do you want another dining table?
[49:44.75]Stuff in the corner.
[49:45.75]I don't think we need.
[49:46.31]Well, actually, maybe to make it so people don't sit outside.
[49:50.10]Okay, and then we'll start.
[49:51.36]And remember, this is like do or die.
[49:53.34]Alright, well, let me get my... Alright, okay.
[49:57.59]So, let me get my sauce ready.
[50:01.71]I'm gonna belch like a weirdo.
[50:04.85]Okay.
[50:05.65]Wait.
[50:06.43]It actually might be nice to have another counter.
[50:08.49]Yeah, get it, get it.
[50:09.19]I didn't see that there was a counter.
[50:10.49]Yeah, we should... We are starved for counter space.
[50:15.26]Oh, okay.
[50:15.76]Oh, man.
[50:17.60]Oh, geez.
[50:18.34]It's really coming together.
[50:21.63]Is that a good place for it?
[50:22.61]I think we need to.
[50:23.43]Can we expand the restaurant?
[50:26.62]No, I think the layout we chose at the beginning.
[50:29.20]When we chose the city layout.
[50:31.80]Alright.
[50:32.58]Oh, that's right.
[50:33.14]That's right.
[50:33.56]OK, I'm ready.
[50:34.72]OK, you're ready.
[50:35.30]You understand the soup needs to be made immediately.

[50:58.08]Why'd you do that?
[51:01.54]Chef, we're going to need an L with sauce.
[51:03.58]Why'd you take the order?
[51:04.36]The soup's not even ready.
[51:05.26]I think he's... I think we're making time.
[51:08.64]It's only one guy.
[51:09.52]It's not like a full table.

[63:23.97]I'm zooming around.
[63:24.79]Look at this.
[63:26.01]Wait, I need those shoes because I'm slower than your people and you took the fucking shoes.
[63:29.55]I'm breaking these things in.

[63:51.83]And you took the fucking shoes.
[63:54.41]You said M. You said two M's.
[63:57.41]What the heck happened here?

[64:59.22]Get that H. Get that L. Get that L. Get that L. We got it right here.
[65:05.36]Just get that L. Just throw it in the trash, dude.
[65:08.46]Just put it.
[65:08.94]No, no, no, no, no.
[65:09.50]I already have the H.
[65:15.27]It's an L. There's no point!
[65:18.47]Oh shit!
[65:24.75]Uh-oh!
[65:24.93]Uh-oh!
[65:27.39]Okay!
[65:28.69]Okay, okay!
[65:31.74]What do they want?
[65:32.94]Two Ls, two Ls!
[65:34.12]Easy, very easy.
[65:34.84]There's a guy outside that couldn't get in.
[65:39.12]Oh my god, dude.
[65:41.04]You took the fucking shoes, dude.
[65:43.91]I'm throwing.
[65:44.55]I'm out there with the customers with the slow speed.
[65:47.35]And he takes the fucking shoes.
[65:49.09]And he's like, look how fast I can run.
[65:50.77]Look how.
[65:52.99]I have to say it.
[65:53.67]I heard two M's.
[65:56.14]And it was two H's.
[65:56.98]I fucked that up.
[65:58.14]But my mind.
[65:59.18]Like, my fucking wife just left me, dude.
[66:03.76]We go again.
[66:04.28]I think we're supposed to lose.
[66:08.18]We did pretty good.
[66:10.13]You're supposed to lose.
[66:12.29]Oh, it's like Vampire Survivors.
[66:13.51]You're not supposed to win.
[66:16.36]So we actually did great.
[66:18.16]I mean, if you're comparing it to one of the games of the year last year, then I would... I mean, that makes sense to me.
[66:23.82]Alright, we got a new menu item.
[66:24.80]Let's do salads.
[66:27.47]A new layout.
[66:29.25]Mix it up a little bit.
[66:33.95]Wait, I think we can change clothes.
[66:36.61]I did uh I you know I like that I like the the speed the high-paced environment alright I like um we're gonna do like a maid cafe if I'm gonna be the one out there oh I can do a pumpkin meow
[67:06.38]What do you want to eat here, Mew?
[67:12.90]You ready?
[67:13.70]I want orange.
[67:24.11]Are you sure you can make salads?
[67:26.47]We'll figure it out.
[67:28.67]Chop lettuce and optionally add chopped tomatoes.
[67:31.93]You okay?
[67:35.09]Come on.
[67:36.24]Yeah, Mark.
[67:36.54]You feeling alright?
[67:43.78]Oh, I like this layout.
[67:45.44]I really can just be up out here.
[67:47.70]You know what I'm saying, friend?
[67:48.70]Let's practice the salad.
[67:55.82]Practice the salad.
[67:58.15]Okay.
[67:58.63]Okay, so the name of the restaurant is... Lettuce Eat.
[68:06.19]I just chopped that into tomato soup.
[68:17.38]So what is it?
[68:17.86]It's chopped lettuce.
[68:20.82]Lettuce on a plate and that's it.
[68:23.12]Optionally add chopped tomato.
[68:25.22]One lettuce, one tomato.
[68:26.62]Okay.
[68:33.96]So you can do a tomato twice.
[68:36.72]So that's it?
[68:38.76]Oh, this isn't going to be easy.
[68:39.66]Alright, cool.
[68:41.19]I like this layout a lot.
[68:42.53]This is way better than the other layout.
[68:44.81]You don't got to cook anything.
[68:46.03]We're vegan in here.
[68:47.35]I was chef last time, and I did a phenomenal job.
[68:51.41]Do you want to be chef this time?
[68:53.07]I mean, I think our roles were working.
[68:55.80]Why don't you try it?
[68:57.14]It's fun.
[68:58.04]But okay.
[68:58.70]I mean, if you... Okay.
[69:01.89]Well, then maybe I should have been the one learning how to make it.
[69:07.30]I mean, dude, it's literally just chopped tomato and chopped lettuce put on a plate.
[69:12.43]It's not that hard.
[69:15.79]I mean, it's hard when you keep covering up every fucking surface.
[69:31.19]Now, if you chop the tomato twice, it makes tomato soup.
[69:34.39]Be aware of that.
[69:35.04]Oh, and I gotta chop that.
[69:37.76]It's just chop.
[69:39.76]Okay, I'm ready.
[69:40.62]That is it.
[69:41.00]Okay, let's... Okay.
[69:50.19]We don't have any money.
[69:51.99]So we can't do any... Wait.
[69:53.17]Booking desk?
[69:54.05]Interact to accelerate time to next customer.
[69:57.33]It's like a hard mode.
[69:58.05]Oh.
[70:00.44]How confident are you?
[70:01.08]Do you want to do that?
[70:07.01]Yeah.
[70:08.87]Let's do that.
[70:15.25]You handle the exterior.
[70:17.41]I'll be in the interior.
[70:18.95]I'm ready.
[70:19.23]We're going to be feeding each other through here.
[70:22.84]Sounds good.
[70:23.26]Alright.
[70:23.52]I'm ready.
[70:32.67]I'm just, I thought you want a little bit of time.
[70:42.78]Perfect.
[70:50.96]You got to memorize that layout.
[70:52.04]I saw you move around a little.
[70:54.86]Oh, you're really going to backseat me.
[70:56.64]Just look over the counter because you have nothing to do and just tell, oh, you're a little bit slow there, buddy.
[71:01.55]Take their fucking order.
[71:02.47]Alright, this person just wants lettuce.
[71:08.11]Lettuce and... Alright, we gotta think of somehow to describe this.
[71:13.08]Some people are gonna just want lettuce.
[71:14.24]Okay.
[71:17.88]Just say lettuce and actual real salad.
[71:20.64]That's too long to say that.
[71:22.60]Like, this person wants lettuce.
[71:25.18]I think it's... You come up with what you want.
[71:28.67]Alright, just...
[71:30.65]By default... Hold on.
[71:31.67]By default... It's going in nighttime.
[71:34.53]We won't get the money if we don't serve them.
[71:36.21]Okay.
[71:36.79]So when I say tomate, that means the whole thing.
[71:39.77]Tomate.
[71:40.15]If I say two orders, and I say one tomate, that means the tomato goes on one.
[71:45.68]You understand?
[71:48.38]Tomate, the whole thing.
[71:50.94]Or what was the other one?
[71:51.96]Okay, so we got two tomates.
[71:53.74]That means the whole works.
[71:54.84]Everything.
[71:55.20]Tomato and lettuce.
[72:11.57]Did you say salad?
[72:15.01]No.
[72:15.93]Salad.
[72:16.63]Okay, I was focused on the task.
[72:19.24]You say tomate if it's with tomatoes.
[72:23.08]And what do you say when it's not with tomatoes?
[72:25.21]Nothing.
[72:25.87]If I say there are two orders, one tomate.
[72:32.81]Is this too much for you?
[72:34.35]Is this too hard of a concept?
[72:35.53]I feel like when they order something and you say nothing.
[72:39.61]No.
[72:39.99]That sounds like a problem.
[72:41.01]I'm going to tell you the number.
[72:42.09]So if three customers come in and sit down right now and they order three different salads, I am going to say... But later, later on... Three customers, two tomates.
[72:51.16]Later on...
[72:52.48]when we're handling more than you know one type of food like if we had steaks in the mix yeah you omitting the type of sat when you can't just say fucking salad what's your point it's gonna cause issues that's what I'm saying well we're not but we're not okay do you see how many levels in a row we had steaks it's gonna be like this for at least the next 40 minutes
[73:19.74]But once it changes, you're going to change everything.
[73:23.64]Okay, so how about this?
[73:26.72]If it's salad, I'm going to say salad with tomato.
[73:31.66]That sucks, though.
[73:32.70]No, we've got to do it like a diner.
[73:35.24]Okay, I'm ready.
[73:40.77]You just say what you're going to say, and I'll try and react.
[73:44.53]I'm telling you, you're going to get it.
[73:46.43]And when it's gone, you're going to miss it.
[73:57.72]Two.
[73:58.14]One to mate.
[74:05.52]Yeah, I want two mate with you.
[74:08.49]Two salads, one to mate.
[74:09.67]How's that?
[74:12.89]Is that better?
[74:13.33]Two salads, one to mate.
[74:14.05]That works for me.
[74:15.03]Good.
[74:20.58]Plain.
[74:23.94]Salad.
[74:24.84]Plain.
[74:25.30]Plain.
[74:25.78]Plain.
[74:26.84]Plain.
[74:29.42]This only works if more than one person is sitting at a table.
[74:32.78]I'm realizing that right now.
[74:34.68]There's a lot of issues.
[74:36.87]There's nothing on the menu called plain based on what we just discussed for like 10 minutes.
[74:41.81]Salad.
[74:45.37]Apology with tears now.
[74:53.39]Just say salad.
[74:54.05]Yeah, but what if the salad salad was to mate?
[74:55.73]Yeah.
[75:02.58]We can take that order.
[75:03.36]Just cleaning.
[75:05.72]Two salads, one to mate.
[75:13.16]You're up.
[75:15.68]Batter up.
[75:19.82]Two salads, two to mate.
[75:27.66]Ah, fuck.
[75:28.12]I made the soup.
[75:29.40]Oh, you turned it into soup.
[75:32.76]It's easy to do by accident.
[75:34.42]I'm just so strong.
[75:35.70]Don't you dare put that down.
[75:36.92]Have you noticed I have not?
[75:46.30]Can you imagine your waiter hovering over your table with a plate of food ready for you to eat it and just staring like waiting?
[75:51.75]And then waiting for you to be done.
[75:53.49]Yeah.
[75:58.51]Very cool.
[75:59.41]I put on these cat ears so that I could be the one interacting with the guests, by the way.
[76:02.87]I just want to point that out.
[76:03.53]Now I'm stuck in the kitchen.
[76:10.82]I don't think we need more seats.
[76:15.04]I need another counter.
[76:15.94]We always need a counter.
[76:16.93]Floor buffer.
[76:18.17]Increases movement speed and prevents spills.
[76:21.55]That's expensive.
[76:23.39]Counter.
[76:24.81]Here we go.
[76:25.59]Got a counter for you.
[76:26.19]What do you want it?
[76:29.12]In the corner.
[76:33.02]This corner up here?
[76:34.44]Yeah.
[76:34.70]There you go.
[76:36.96]Okay, we're good to go.
[76:37.84]That's a good setup, actually.
[76:39.98]I'm curious if you can grab diagonally.
[76:42.26]If you can, like, grab that plate.
[76:48.27]Do you try?
[76:48.67]Yep.
[76:51.15]Oh, good.
[76:51.61]Yeah, this is awesome.
[76:53.93]Okay, here we go.
[76:56.25]Two salad, two tomato.
[76:59.53]Oh, I can also like if we're in a hurry, I can put stuff down.
[77:02.20]You could start chopping it.
[77:03.86]Oh, I can chop it from here.
[77:04.92]You're right.
[77:13.65]One salad to mate.
[77:28.93]man this is too easy this is like taking money from babies they're paying for food one tomato salad clean that plate okay come on come on come on one salad nothing on it
[77:58.52]I don't know if I could do that.
[78:04.19]Here, enjoy your fucking grass.
[78:05.91]One salad, one tomato.
[78:06.57]Ah!
[78:16.37]Wash the dishes?
[78:17.00]Because I would have to walk across the whole thing.
[78:21.46]Ah!
[78:23.78]I got customers out here.
[78:24.74]They're complaining.
[78:26.26]Ah!
[78:27.04]One salad, one to mate.
[78:28.16]Still waiting for it.
[78:28.92]It's hard to make these.
[78:30.09]There are like so many steps.
[78:37.53]Mate salad.
[78:45.23]We need an extra sink.
[78:47.22]We actually could put a sink out here.
[78:49.28]You actually should put that sink out here.
[78:51.20]That makes so much sense.
[78:53.00]That makes so much sense.
[78:54.58]Yeah.
[78:54.90]Let me have that sink over here.
[78:59.29]Oh, okay.
[79:07.68]25% love.
[79:08.12]Oh, you get it.
[79:10.26]Wait, why would we do that?
[79:11.48]Yeah, why?
[79:12.10]Show me potato salad.
[79:15.30]But why would we do the one on the left?
[79:20.10]In case you're scared of making potato salad.
[79:23.12]You're the one making it.
[79:26.11]Make the customers do their own dishes.
[79:29.91]chop a potato add to water in a pot and boil we don't even have a stove oh they probably gave us the stove wait wait wait wait wait wait a second I need to like screenshot this no just go into practice I'm telling you it looks that was intimidating when I looked at it too but it's literally easy you just have to go into it I'm putting that description on my other monitor in case I have a dumb moment
[79:55.77]I've got a little cheat sheet okay so let's go into practice real quick uh we we need to uh open all our partials oh we just got an oven for free yeah because we needed to make the potato salad was that eggs because I have to crack an egg oh dude and I'm in the kitchen all alone dude oh man hey how do you think I felt dude to make the sauce every day
[80:26.18]How about this?
[80:28.02]You want me to add the olive oil?
[80:30.12]How about we put the sink down in that room?
[80:35.24]I can wash the dishes.
[80:37.32]If that's what you want me to do.
[80:40.48]Do you want the sink up in the corner so we can just put them right on the... Put the sink right there.
[80:45.27]That's so perfect.
[80:46.01]Because then I can put it right here.
[80:47.43]I can put the clean plates right here.
[80:53.09]Okay.
[80:54.49]You don't really have a whole lot of room in there.
[80:56.11]Olive oil's over there.
[81:01.31]I'm gonna need the sink to add water to a pot for the salad.
[81:08.58]Shit.
[81:10.07]I don't know if it's like the thing you were making where you only have to make it once.
[81:14.42]I don't know.
[81:14.96]Let's do practice because if you pass it to me, I can fill the pot and just put it back over here.
[81:19.54]Yeah, I just want to figure out this layout.
[81:21.04]Oh, and this is the olive.
[81:22.98]Jesus Christ.
[81:31.12]I told you we could add this one thing to the menu.
[81:36.38]Okay, let's do practice.
[81:37.16]Let's hit it up.
[81:40.03]Okay.
[81:41.44]Do you want another counter?
[81:45.18]For down here in the lower right?
[81:48.76]Yeah, absolutely.
[81:49.56]Always counter.
[81:50.60]I think you can even have a counter out there for an extra dirty plate.
[81:54.08]So... Somebody's saying you should do the olive oil.
[81:59.85]I mean, I should... Yeah, like you as in me.
[82:02.11]Like, I should do the finishing on it?
[82:07.25]Maybe?
[82:07.55]Maybe?
[82:10.62]Well, let's just practice it.
[82:12.48]Here, let me... Wait, don't do it yet.
[82:14.30]Let me... I can hit B. It's easy.
[82:19.34]That sigh.
[82:22.52]I'm stressed.
[82:24.23]Okay, let's go.
[82:27.19]Ready.
[82:27.93]Practice.
[82:32.95]Okay, game is played up.
[82:36.05]Chop potato.
[82:39.38]Add water.
[82:42.71]Water this up.
[82:45.07]Jerma.
[82:45.69]Jerma.
[82:46.12]Jerma.
[82:46.32]Jerma.
[82:47.06]Jerma.
[82:47.68]Jerma.
[82:49.04]I'm sipping my drink.
[82:53.62]Yeah, they want... Okay, we want... Whatever that is.
[82:57.10]Then you boil that.
[83:00.87]What's your next step?
[83:01.87]This is crack egg and add olive oil.
[83:03.99]So I think you need to put olive oil in that egg.
[83:05.95]Okay, I think I just did.
[83:08.97]Okay.
[83:09.19]Okay.
[83:10.46]Then yeah, then the potatoes are ready to go.
[83:15.98]Combine all three out of plate.
[83:21.61]Oh my God, I gotta boil the potatoes every fucking Jesus every time.
[83:27.09]Interesting, OK, and then yes, let me to make salad.
[83:33.59]If I put the pot there, it needs water.
[83:35.04]I thought you're going to.
[83:37.70]I thought you're going to do tomato.
[83:40.75]I just, because it's practice, I just want to... I don't think that's done, by the way.
[83:44.51]That doesn't look like the thing the cat wants.
[83:48.04]Is it missing something?
[83:48.68]That looks like a different picture, doesn't it?
[83:54.18]Yeah.
[83:56.18]Okay, let me go through this one by one.
[83:57.82]Chop a potato.
[83:58.72]Oh, you're missing the onion.
[84:03.60]Add to water in a pot.
[84:10.23]Crack an egg.
[84:10.89]Olive oil with the egg.
[84:13.75]Chop onions.
[84:14.51]I did skip the onions.
[84:20.42]And then you just throw that on the... You just throw that on the plate?
[84:26.56]Then I need an empty plate.
[84:28.10]And I gotta like...
[84:43.03]I don't know about this, man.
[84:45.37]We got it.
[84:48.53]We're good.
[84:48.79]You want to leave practice?
[84:51.21]Make it a couple times.
[84:52.01]Make it like two or three times.
[84:54.19]Okay, let's speedrun this.
[84:55.84]Pot means I need water.
[84:57.30]Pot.
[84:57.84]Say it too.
[84:58.36]Go pot.
[85:00.74]And when you need oil, just say like grease.
[85:05.32]Oil egg.
[85:09.24]Oil egg.
[85:09.86]Oil egg.
[85:10.52]That's too many syllables.
[85:11.26]Grease is one.
[85:20.96]And then water.
[85:21.85]I'm missing the onion.
[85:27.97]Okay, onion comes at the end.
[85:31.27]I think I'm good.
[85:32.35]I think I'm good.
[85:33.65]Are you good?
[85:33.99]It's just a lot of steps.
[85:35.49]Try it one more time.
[85:37.23]Just say oil.
[85:37.93]Oil is two syllables.
[85:38.91]No.
[85:39.44]Grease.
[85:41.16]Oil.
[85:41.84]Oil is two syllables.
[85:43.38]It's oil.
[85:44.60]Oil.
[85:45.44]Oil.
[85:46.44]Grease.
[85:47.48]Oil.
[85:48.32]Oil.
[85:49.32]I don't want our customers to think we're greasing up their food.
[85:52.00]No, just say grease.
[85:52.92]Just say grease.
[85:56.01]Grease.
[85:56.75]Yes, thank you.
[85:57.73]Right?
[85:58.07]Wait, no.
[86:01.47]That extra quarter of a second could be time you're chopping the onion.
[86:05.99]Oil.
[86:06.71]Grease.
[86:10.55]Oh, my God.
[86:11.07]And don't say, give me water.
[86:12.71]Give me water.
[86:13.91]It's pot.
[86:16.70]Can we use English?
[86:18.06]It's cool if we just speak English.
[86:19.46]Those are both English words that I just said.
[86:22.35]Did I not chop?
[86:25.57]What am I doing?
[86:26.47]Did I just cook a whole potato?
[86:30.34]What did you even make?
[86:31.24]What is that?
[86:31.78]I don't know.
[86:33.92]I'm ready.
[86:34.22]Trust me.
[86:34.56]Trust me.
[86:34.92]Trust me.
[86:36.14]No, you're not.
[86:36.64]I want you to do it right.
[86:38.39]Leave practice mode.
[86:39.15]Trust me with your fucking life right now.
[86:42.77]This is going to go so smoothly.
[86:45.15]Okay.
[86:53.29]Good afternoon.
[86:54.03]Welcome to Lettucey.
[86:56.81]Water.

[87:05.19]No, just take the order.
[87:06.33]We're good.
[87:06.81]I just want to, like, get started on at least one.
[87:09.13]Yeah, because of course he's going to fucking want it.
[87:12.66]Guy coming to my restaurant.
[87:14.04]In my restaurant.
[87:15.18]And he wants me to eat ham food.
[87:17.00]Look how long this takes.
[87:18.36]Just make it and shut up.
[87:24.18]Grease.
[87:25.24]See how quick that was?
[87:26.18]I don't know what that is.
[87:34.33]Dude, why are you putting the whole potato in there?
[87:39.35]You told me you were ready.
[87:41.47]I don't have a trash over here.
[87:42.54]You do.
[87:44.10]Wait, do I have to take this outside?
[87:45.96]Water.
[87:47.10]Can we restart?
[87:49.16]Can we just ask them to come back later?
[87:50.68]Water.
[87:55.78]Why are you making me do water twice?
[87:57.71]I keep forgetting to drop the potatoes.
[87:59.73]Get out of the goddamn kitchen.
[88:01.59]I'll do it.
[88:04.46]I see what I did.
[88:05.20]No, trust me.
[88:05.68]I got it.
[88:05.94]Get out of the kitchen.
[88:07.12]Please stop.
[88:07.78]Please stop.

[88:09.40]Please.
[88:09.78]I have this.
[88:10.44]Please.
[88:10.84]I forgot.
[88:11.84]I forgot we had another grill.
[88:12.84]That actually would help a lot.
[88:16.21]Why does every single person want only this?
[88:20.09]Lettuce eat.
[88:20.63]We're a salad place.
[88:21.85]And they all came in and they want this crazy fucking dish.
[88:27.23]Anybody want to lick the bottom of the pan?
[88:30.84]It's okay.
[88:31.24]I think we get a redo on this one.
[88:32.52]Because it was day three.
[88:33.88]No, it's day four.
[88:34.54]I don't know.
[88:35.04]Please.
[88:35.76]Please.
[88:36.02]I need this fucking job.
[88:36.96]I need this job.
[88:37.74]Please, God.
[88:38.42]Please.
[88:40.02]You told me.
[88:40.80]You were so confident.

[88:45.77]Let's pizza.
[88:46.37]Pizzeria.
[88:46.83]Pizzeria.
[88:47.87]I get to make fun food and not food for people that want a bowl of fucking dog shit.
[88:55.09]potatoes onions a nice creamed uh a nice oil and egg that sounds delicious what do you mean that you should have handled it then okay you choose you choose the kitchen style we're doing pizzas are you cooking the pizza then you should pick the style
[89:13.71]no you styles on you why you should be worth 50 50 partnership but it should be what you're comfortable with because you're the one in the kitchen the whole time um well it's a floor plan not just for the kitchen but also for you okay so if we're doing a pizza oven then we need a big space see that top right corner that's a big space okay let's go for that let's go for that honey that sounds good okay let's go yeah I'm a bit of a kitsune by the way I identify as a kitsune fox
[89:39.44]Okay.
[89:39.96]Okay.
[89:40.88]Uh, let's go.
[89:41.74]Uh, need... Okay, let me take this picture.
[89:46.46]You don't need... Just don't skip it and just read it right now!
[89:49.82]I'm gonna... Trust me, dude.
[89:51.00]I'm gonna need it.
[89:54.30]But why are you taking a screenshot?
[89:55.68]Just read it right now!
[89:57.40]I have it.
[89:58.43]Forever.
[89:59.81]Now.
[90:04.59]You ready to practice?
[90:05.65]Get out of my way!
[90:08.32]Throw this in the trash.
[90:09.80]Let's start the day, because you can't fail the first day.
[90:13.08]I'm going to bang out this pizza first try.
[90:15.06]Easy.
[90:16.91]Jerma, you're questioning Ster too much.
[90:18.59]We need to kick you off the show.
[90:20.51]He just assured me that he was going to do everything, and he didn't even get one plate out the door.
[90:27.49]Oil chopped tomato.
[90:34.72]We got two pizzas.
[90:35.78]We want two pizzas.
[90:42.23]Did you just put it into the oven without any cheese on it?
[90:47.59]Did they ask for cheese?
[90:48.77]You didn't say cheese.
[90:49.75]A sauce pizza?
[90:54.69]What are you?
[90:55.57]Have you ever had a pizza before?
[90:57.31]Can you knead that dough?
[90:58.93]I asked as well.
[91:00.69]This is why I didn't.
[91:01.57]I don't even know what the ingredient.
[91:02.76]I don't know what's happening.
[91:05.88]You put a sauce pizza in the oven and you're mad at me.
[91:12.03]Trust me, I got this.
[91:12.81]Just, like, wait to take the order.
[91:14.11]I know you're, like, standing still out there.
[91:15.77]You're having a fucking great time.
[91:17.21]Dude, there's already a pizza in the oven.
[91:18.57]Oh, my God.
[91:18.89]It's seriously one pizza at a time.
[91:20.23]You didn't even cook it yet.
[91:22.01]I thought I had to make two whole pizzas.
[91:27.61]Here, give them.
[91:29.47]Do you have to chop it?
[91:31.18]That's what I mean.
[91:31.78]We got to chop the pizza?
[91:33.28]Just slice it.
[91:35.60]Ah.
[91:35.70]And then plate it.
[91:36.42]And then plate it.
[91:37.00]Okay, sounds good.
[91:39.02]Well, they're going to leave.
[91:42.66]I mean, are they?
[91:45.34]Maybe not.
[91:48.70]Okay, get the order.
[91:50.29]Someone's got to get the order.
[91:51.23]Get the order quick.
[91:53.29]You need to move this plate so I can do anything.
[91:55.41]You got to move the plate.
[91:56.67]I'm supposed to wash the dishes too.
[92:02.76]We need plates.
[92:04.00]You have the plates.
[92:18.01]I need, um... I need pizza over here, please.
[92:25.75]Go help?
[92:38.86]If I walk in there, he's going to... He's going to berate me if I step in there.
[92:43.06]I will if you even come a foot in this kitchen.
[92:51.96]Okay, it's not as bad as I thought because they all want slices.
[92:59.41]So it gives us a lot of time to prepare one and we can handle a few people.
[93:03.69]Yeah, no, we're good.
[93:04.65]We got it.
[93:06.45]I just think that there may be one step of this
[93:12.46]that like you could help with and what do you want that to be all you said was you put dough here and you screamed at me and you said why are you not needing the dough which I didn't even know that that needed to happen um you took the screenshot remember you remember you it was on the screen and you just pressed a yeah yeah I remember here um let's see what we got
[93:41.93]I think just with another counter, that'll be a lot easier.
[93:44.53]I think that's all I really need.
[93:45.89]And we've got like the three, like the Omega counter set up.
[93:49.73]Do plates and sink.
[93:50.69]I could do plates.
[93:52.31]I could do plates and sink.
[93:54.99]Yeah, you give me the option to do something in here and I will leave your kitchen alone.
[94:02.49]Okay.
[94:02.73]Yeah, because, yeah, you were spending a lot of time watching me and judging me.
[94:10.58]So, yeah, you put those where you want.
[94:12.34]We're all just pointing and laughing at you over here.
[94:14.46]You're going to wash the dishes.
[94:16.94]Wash dishes.
[94:20.74]And then I need a spot because I think about this, right?
[94:23.84]If I wash a dish here, I need to walk in here.
[94:27.79]Give me something that you can come and grab really quick.
[94:31.89]Or I guess you could do it.
[94:32.59]Conveyor.
[94:42.42]Would you eat a raw pizza for a trillion dollars?
[94:46.26]Um, yes.
[94:48.31]What?
[94:50.03]I could literally change the entire Earth if I had a trillion dollars.
[94:54.13]Like, what do you mean?
[94:54.57]Just eat a raw pizza and, like, shit my pants and puke for a day?
[94:58.14]Like, a trillion dollars?
[95:01.41]Wait, what is this conveyor belt?
[95:02.21]I could solve every problem, probably, on Earth.
[95:05.13]I could do so much with that.
[95:06.15]I would- I'd just- I'd just shit my pants once, for like a couple days.
[95:10.20]I'll do it right now.
[95:12.06]Free.
[95:13.08]Yes, but it's yucky and gross.
[95:15.14]Oh, the hell.
[95:15.92]You're right.
[95:17.86]Yuck.
[95:18.08]Alright, are you good?
[95:23.52]Yeah.
[95:24.72]So, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
[95:25.88]I'm gonna put them on that counter on the left.
[95:29.14]Or if there's an open space, you can even just place them on the front counters and I can put pizzas on them.
[95:34.08]Yes.
[95:34.48]Like just play it by ear.
[95:36.19]We'll figure it out during the day.
[95:37.31]Sounds good.
[95:53.69]I wonder what this person's gonna order.
[95:55.39]You can take it.
[95:58.11]It's a cheese pizza.
[96:15.10]And this person wants a cheese pizza.
[96:18.99]You have the plates.
[96:19.85]I think you can handle that.
[96:24.47]This person wants a cheese.
[96:27.17]Oh, I need to cut it.
[96:28.81]What are you putting?
[96:30.75]What is this weird banana you put on here?
[96:33.87]That's cheese.
[96:34.91]I don't know how to take it off.
[96:36.05]How do you get it off?
[96:36.97]You just have to throw it away.
[96:38.98]Just throw it away.
[96:42.14]You just put like banana pudding over here.
[96:43.46]Alright, pizza.
[96:46.04]Pizza.
[96:55.71]oh fuck we're good I think I think this is it feels like a lot but we're we're serving you know four people oh we are serving we need more pizza slice like this is practically already ready to go take that order before the night ends
[97:27.37]Nice.
[97:28.97]Alright.
[97:29.23]That's a pretty good system.
[97:35.08]Let them serve.
[97:36.26]Yeah.
[97:37.56]We're doing alright.
[97:38.28]Fine.
[97:41.38]Yeah.
[97:41.66]That was very calm, relaxed.
[97:43.90]There's also an extra sink for cheap.
[97:50.22]Get it and put it in your room.
[97:52.10]I need this counter.
[97:53.58]I absolutely need another counter.
[97:55.46]Yeah.
[97:58.34]Extra cheese.
[98:02.92]You like Five Guys, right?
[98:05.26]I do.
[98:05.94]What's your Five Guys?
[98:06.98]What's your go-to Five Guys order?
[98:10.06]In general, my burgers, I've grown to like pickles quite a bit.
[98:13.20]Okay.
[98:14.28]But if I'm not going for like a basic burger with pickles, I like to get, you know, barbecue sauce, onion rings, grilled onion rings.
[98:21.81]Onion rings, okay.
[98:24.22]Or like grilled onions or onion rings, either one.
[98:25.92]Depends, you know, how hard you want to go.
[98:27.60]Like a Western burger.
[98:29.22]You want me to give you an order to try?
[98:32.04]You want me to cook you a burger right now?
[98:33.66]No, I'm saying give you an order to try at Five Guys.
[98:37.19]Sure, I haven't been in a while, but sure.
[98:38.45]Hey, can you cook me a burger right now?
[98:40.63]I can get some Crackle Barrel and go down to the Five Guy and get the burger and put it all together.
[98:46.07]Is that what you want?
[98:47.36]So here's what you're going to do.
[98:48.48]You're going to order Five Guys Burger, grilled onions, jalapenos, and A1 sauce cheeseburger.
[98:58.34]I don't like jalapenos.
[99:00.03]Not at all?
[99:00.81]They're okay.
[99:01.29]I mean, it depends if they're like... When does a jalapeno become like super hot?
[99:07.43]They're all pretty much the same.
[99:08.91]You might get one with a lot of seeds, but it's really not that hot.
[99:11.55]Jalapenos are pretty low on the scale.
[99:13.47]Okay.
[99:14.47]I'm a pretty baby boy, to be honest.
[99:17.43]I'm kind of like a little toddler.
[99:20.05]They are fresh cut jalapenos.
[99:21.53]That's why they're the best.
[99:22.45]They're not really that hot.
[99:24.99]You get that kind of front of the mouth tingle, but they're not that bad.
[99:27.83]They're not.
[99:29.03]Yeah, I remember I would also get them with green peppers.
[99:32.27]A little bit of green pepper.
[99:39.82]That's not bad.
[99:43.00]But yeah, barbecue sauce on a burger is kind of nice.
[99:49.94]Barbecue sauce on a lot of stuff is kind of overpowering to me.
[99:53.04]You can take that order.

[100:47.36]Yeah, you're in the back of the kitchen.
[100:49.58]They're not hearing you.
[100:50.60]They can get a pizza anywhere, but they come here because they like the atmosphere.

[102:39.91]Yeah.
[102:41.97]We're a pizza place.
[102:42.95]We don't do pumpkin pie.
[102:47.37]Want to come in for a little bit of pie and some pie?
[102:49.27]I'm eating possibly already rotten pie from Christmas.
[102:59.24]Dude, you probably shouldn't be doing that right now.
[103:03.36]Christmas is the 25th.
[103:05.58]What day is it?
[103:07.52]Was today the 9th?
[103:12.24]I don't know if you should eat that.
[103:13.19]A Christmas pie?
[103:15.59]How long?
[103:16.39]What kind of pie is that?
[103:18.73]Don't eat that pie.
[103:20.59]Yeah, I don't think you should eat that pie.
[103:28.76]This thing cleans floor messes faster?
[103:31.48]Rip chat member.
[103:33.00]Oh, we got another table.
[103:35.84]Let's get that.
[103:37.52]Yeah, that's a big deal.
[103:38.08]I'm going to put this in the corner.
[103:41.16]yeah we want to keep them away from the kitchen too because you'll walk slower if you're near them so we want them like on this on this side yeah I think that's not um maybe this corner and then uh seriously don't don't put them by that door trust me yeah but we've we have never sat more than three people okay uh you might have trouble getting to the people in the corner only one person at least two
[104:12.91]There you go.
[104:13.93]222.
[104:14.05]Okay.
[104:14.63]Wait, what is that sign?
[104:16.51]I thought, did you write that?
[104:18.75]That's the name of the restaurant.
[104:19.98]I just saw that.
[104:20.74]I just saw pussy.
[104:22.14]I'm like, wait, why did you do that?
[104:24.00]I'm like, why did you write that?
[104:25.34]Why did you make the name of the restaurant?
[104:27.16]Because I'm a cat.
[104:28.56]I was like, what does this say?
[104:29.70]Are we going to have a problem?
[104:33.98]I thought you came down here and wrote like, I don't know.
[104:36.38]I thought you just started writing shit.
[104:39.66]Okay.
[104:46.35]Do we want more plates?
[104:49.15]The plate rack also holds eight instead of those, so they're easier to stack.
[104:54.39]And that's the last decision if you want an extra set of plates.
[104:59.86]I think we need more counters before we have more plates.
[105:02.78]Well, then we would have to re-roll the blueprints there, buddy.
[105:07.52]Why did you read it?
[105:08.18]Because that's the name of the sign.
[105:17.46]dumb waiter what do we got going on here teleports items to other dumb waiters finally he said it for the auto sentence generator what are you doing what does that mean what's that are you ready what does that what does that mean why'd they say that what's that mean what who are you hello are you good ready I think I'm good

[106:35.83]Why is that one so huge?
[106:37.51]That is not a plate.
[106:39.07]That's the unsauced pizza.
[106:55.29]Two pizzas is what we need.
[106:57.65]Why did you say it like that?

[111:14.29]You pressed it.
[111:15.01]I pressed it like 10 minutes ago.
[111:17.51]When people sit on the vertical of that, you're not going to be able to walk past them.
[111:21.93]Dude, that's the kind of reaction for somebody cutting the red wire when you said yellow.
[111:31.74]Yeah, nice job.
[111:32.30]You made a soup.
[111:36.08]Yeah, I know you don't like touching that one because it's too finicky.

[112:30.99]-2 RP.
[112:34.19]Are we supposed to be RPing right now?
[112:35.63]I didn't know that's what we were doing.
[112:41.52]Instant service.
[112:42.66]Instant service right there.
[112:57.36]can we eventually add toppings like pepperoni my favorite I'm surprised they haven't thrown that curveball in here yet I feel like that'd be the easiest thing and instead they wanted us to make pumpkin pies like can't we just add pumpkin to the top of a pizza no we need pumpkin pies well that'd be kind of gross I I've you know you get what you came for rancid stanky pie
[113:31.35]Shut up.
[113:32.30]Stop making so much fucking weird noise.
[113:34.88]What is wrong?

[113:44.35]Affordable.
[113:48.47]Or formal.
[113:49.65]A formal pizza place?
[113:53.39]Decreased mess.
[113:55.46]The mess, as they amped up the mess on us last time, you remember we were walking in quicksand and you're already slow out there.
[114:00.84]That's true.
[114:02.36]I agree.
[114:05.78]A formal pizza place.
[114:09.16]What's wrong with them today?
[114:10.55]Well, then we got to change.
[114:11.31]We got to change the name again if we're a formal place now.
[114:20.63]Ooh, calm painting, double patience.
[114:27.01]Yeah, what should we rename it?
[114:31.78]I don't know.
[114:32.98]I've come up with a few.
[114:34.04]I feel like you didn't like any of mine, so you can do you now.
[114:41.95]How's that?
[114:52.90]That's great, man.
[114:54.66]How is that lame?

[116:21.82]People are on their lunch break.
[116:22.92]They just walk in, grab a slice.
[116:24.90]You're talking about like half of New York City does that.
[116:28.85]Looking like he has no friends right now.
[116:31.07]I feel like I've done that before.
[116:40.85]Loser.
[116:42.21]Oh, my God.
[116:44.58]Oh, my God.

[118:17.04]No one is washing them!
[118:18.02]God, it's a slow, slippery, fucking oil on the ground.
[118:21.18]No one is washing the plates, dude.
[118:23.14]You burnt an entire pizza.
[118:27.58]Are we supposed to have three people?
[118:40.78]Can you imagine going to a pizza place?
[118:44.00]You sit down and there's a ton of people in this place.
[118:48.18]And the chef, you just hear him screaming.
[118:53.27]And he's walking by the kitchen.
[118:55.75]You look over and he has a black pizza in his hands.
[118:59.15]And it's smoking and he's running around.
[119:03.52]oh my god I have done that a few times where I like forgot I had a piece in the oven and it's just turned into like it's been like 10 plus years but I definitely murdered a few pizzas yeah that was just not just a little overdone or a little burnt that was that was just cut charcoal it was just gray oh that was so funny
[119:31.21]Do you want to do pizza again?
[119:33.45]I need the redemption arc.
[119:34.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:35.21]What is this?
[119:35.65]We got new items in the garage?
[119:39.17]Upgrade kit?
[119:46.20]Holding it in your hands.
[119:52.40]What are these?
[119:53.36]Somebody said put the washing station at the counter.
[119:58.80]Yeah.
[119:58.94]Well, I wonder what this is.
[120:01.02]I think those are like our unlocks.
[120:02.59]I don't know.
[120:05.99]That was almost the Voldemort scream.
[120:11.27]Alright, man.
[120:13.09]Let's go.
[120:13.43]Let's go.
[120:13.77]Let's go.
[120:14.03]Alright.
[120:14.87]You know what you're doing.
[120:15.61]Do you like this setup?
[120:16.54]You like this setup this way?
[120:21.38]No.
[120:23.78]I don't like it.
[120:24.68]Well, then we should probably pick the layout that you want to be in.
[120:29.92]Do you want to wash the dishes this time?
[120:33.48]I was, but what you don't understand is you burnt the pizza and people got angry at you.
[120:39.93]Alright, well, let's start the day and then you can wash the dishes.
[120:44.73]This is our third venture together.
[120:46.55]Oh, there's a door right here, by the way.
[120:48.31]There's a lot of doors.
[120:51.23]Okay, you ready to go?
[120:52.95]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[120:54.23]This one is going to be our multi-million dollar franchise.
[120:57.63]Well, guess what?
[120:58.31]They want pizza.
[121:00.00]Yeah.
[121:01.82]Original ingredients.
[121:03.42]Papa John's ingredients.
[121:08.06]Want it fast, want it fresh.
[121:09.59]Papa Gino's is way better.
[121:12.01]Papa Gino's in my Gino's.
[121:17.09]Do you know how to plate that?
[121:17.99]I was thinking about Puppagino's.
[121:20.62]Do you know how to plate that?
[121:21.90]I'm thinking about the delicious flavor of Puppagino's pizza and I got confused.
[121:25.70]Think you can handle the plating, dear?
[121:29.19]Get out of the fucking way.
[121:31.45]First one's in the way.
[121:45.60]I'm hovering.
[121:46.30]I'm hovering.
[121:47.92]Get out.
[121:49.16]Get out of here.
[121:50.93]It seems like you need all the help you can get.
[121:52.59]There, little boy.
[121:58.00]Okay, people said that I'm being weird tonight.
[121:59.98]Are you sure it's not him?
[122:02.04]I feel like it's him.
[122:03.34]I think you're being kind of weird tonight.
[122:05.02]No, it's him.
[122:05.30]You were very weird earlier with the whole, like, you hated Ember and didn't want to say it and then played it anyway to play it off like you liked the game.
[122:11.71]That was, like, the weirdest shit you've ever done.
[122:13.59]No, nope.
[122:14.47]No, you are the weird one today.
[122:16.49]And we have evidence.
[122:19.35]I feel like you shouldn't have agreed to play it.
[122:24.69]No, I enjoyed that experience.
[122:26.99]It was fun.
[122:27.39]That was like a good time.
[122:30.19]So I was the problem.
[122:31.73]Why can't you pull me?
[122:32.89]You are both weird.
[122:33.65]You were just sitting around like, man, this game's fun, but I wish Ludwig would ask me to play.
[122:38.87]Is that how it is now?
[122:44.89]I mean, he's a fucking funny guy.
[122:47.55]Super funny, super talented.
[122:48.91]You get a problem with that?
[122:50.89]Yeah, he definitely would have wanted to have been a pussycat pie shop.
[122:56.71]Can you help?
[122:58.39]What do you mean, can I help?
[123:00.45]Can you handle the plating?
[123:01.99]Yes or no?
[123:02.74]Do you want me making pies or do you want me out there?
[123:12.68]You're running around, running around and... You're running around and it's causing stress.
[123:30.38]Oh, that's a door.
[123:32.03]Where do we want this counter?
[123:32.81]I think we need an extra plate counter.
[123:38.23]You would like Ludwig.
[123:39.01]I fucking met him!
[123:42.15]Like, what do you mean I would like Ludwig?
[123:47.68]We did the thing together!
[124:06.18]You got me so fucked up tonight.
[124:10.63]What have I done?
[124:11.59]I don't know.
[124:15.59]The thing is, I was gonna try to fuck with you back.
[124:19.32]But then I realized what I was saying and it was just so wrong.
[124:23.86]Oh my god.
[124:26.86]Are you drunk?
[124:27.56]No, no.
[124:29.24]Oh my god, that's so fucking funny.
[124:33.10]I wish we had one more dollar to buy that thing.
[124:35.67]That's all I'm saying.
[124:38.07]Ow.
[124:38.93]My fucking chest.
[124:40.99]Maybe you should introduce me sometime.
[124:46.51]Oh, that's so funny.
[124:48.33]That's so funny.
[124:50.21]Tell me right now that that's not funny.
[124:51.83]Tell me.
[124:52.55]I'd love to hear it.
[124:53.09]That's pretty funny.
[124:57.79]You need to read a clock?
[125:07.85]Are you ready?
[125:08.39]Yeah.
[125:11.15]He zonked.
[125:25.66]I was trying to be cheeky.
[125:26.68]And I couldn't do it.
[125:36.64]You handle that?
[125:37.30]You handle the plating?
[125:38.70]I can handle it.
[125:44.78]Start on batch number two up here.
[125:46.60]Oh, hold on one second.
[125:48.08]We're running out of counter space.
[125:51.19]Oh my God, I forgot they needed pizza over here.
[125:53.21]I'm going to go chop this in the kitchen, in the washroom, in the bathroom, in the sink.
[125:58.73]Dude, this layout actually sucks.
[126:00.93]It does.
[126:01.27]We need to figure something out.
[126:17.63]This is not great.
[126:18.59]No, this is a terrible pizza.
[126:19.71]I have a pizza ready to cook.
[126:21.11]Like, I'm ready for them.
[126:25.83]Just it's it's the plates, man.
[126:29.13]Everything's very far away.
[126:40.24]You would like Ludwig.
[126:43.46]I love that so much.
[126:45.87]My attempt at being cheeky with you backfired immensely in my brain.
[126:55.04]I was... Got him.
[126:55.84]I'm literally right here.
[126:57.65]Got him.
[126:59.17]Literally, I got it.
[127:05.45]Hey, we can eat these too.
[127:06.43]Yeah, we can.
[127:07.47]Oh, yeah.
[127:07.79]I had another pizza right in the oven.
[127:09.36]I am so ahead.
[127:11.81]Maybe I should be helping you with plates more, because they are the issue.
[127:14.51]Did you forget they were sitting there?
[127:15.87]No, I was trying to do this thing where it's like... I was trying to do a thing where it's like, oh yeah, you'd like him if you met him.
[127:27.65]Knowing that you did.
[127:29.23]But it wasn't even funny.
[127:31.01]And I just look like a fucking imbecile.
[127:38.81]That's a lie.
[127:40.13]Honestly...
[127:47.64]I'm trying to plan the layout over here you're like you're still embarrassed because you're a fool you're a jabroni yo I yeah I would like him yeah I would alright let's get it I'm in the zone dude just move your tables
[128:12.52]actually I know you can put counters here but I kind of a good idea I feel like I'd be using that door oh it just deletes the door too you're forgetting that Ster was even there I mean that's one of my favorite streams I've ever done do you think I forgot it I don't know someone been telling me about the baseball thing for like a year if I wanted to come down and and then what do you know suddenly it's just happening uh do we need another like burner or anything
[128:42.49]uh we do not cook anything on burners but like oh you don't it's only the oven right okay I like this setup because I can go right here bang bang oh can we buy that other sink okay because there's always like you you go to clean a plate and there's already a dirty plate okay let's go remember you look like a wood elf you guys are me up today
[129:17.63]Okay, pizza, pizza, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[129:20.57]Are you for real?
[129:22.49]What do you mean?
[129:25.53]I'm working on it there, coach.
[129:28.37]Okay, we need two slices.
[129:35.11]Pizza up.
[129:35.61]Pizza up.
[129:42.41]Got another pie in the oven ready to cook.
[129:43.81]Not going to cook it yet.
[129:45.05]Perfect.
[129:46.85]Looking pretty slick.
[129:48.94]Looking pretty sly.
[129:58.22]Okay, I absolutely aced this mission.
[130:02.66]You've done a pretty good job.
[130:04.46]Okay, that pizza's ready to cook, and we have another pizza ready to cook after that pizza.
[130:09.23]Do you need a hand?
[130:10.93]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[130:18.87]Okay, pie up.
[130:19.51]I'll wash the dishes for you now.
[130:22.17]Thank you.
[130:26.67]Oh, yes.
[130:27.77]Slay queen, yes.
[130:30.33]I'll wash the dishes.
[130:32.38]We just beat it.
[130:35.94]Bonus pie.
[130:40.64]Why are they sitting at the dirty table?
[130:43.30]That is pretty weird.
[130:52.11]Are you able to, like, delete counters at a certain point?
[130:55.37]Like, if we wanted to delete this plate tray so we can get the bigger plates?
[131:01.00]You know what I'm saying?
[131:02.18]Yes!
[131:02.50]Yeah!
[131:03.30]Yes!
[131:03.42]Yeah!
[131:03.68]One star!
[131:04.26]Fuck yeah!
[131:05.96]Fuck yeah!
[131:06.38]Alright, dude.
[131:07.04]Nice.
[131:08.04]My heart is fucking racing.
[131:09.54]Why are you pretending?
[131:16.92]Isn't that just... Chopped onion as a pizza topping.
[131:19.42]Let's get it.
[131:20.38]Oh, finally.
[131:31.96]Chop onion and add to pizza before.
[131:35.63]Read it.
[131:37.49]Wait, was it before cooking?
[131:39.19]I don't know.
[131:40.53]What do you think?
[131:42.35]It sounded like you said before.
[131:43.81]Before.
[131:54.25]Before.
[131:55.13]You don't even like pizza, you poser.
[131:58.61]who doesn't like pizza oh yeah okay so I think we can buy the bigger stack of plates and if we put the this stack of plates outside it deletes it is what I think oh yeah there's a trash out here uh some of you guys not like pizza
[132:18.09]Oh, and you sell it.
[132:19.61]I don't know if you get money for it.
[132:21.25]I feel like humans have developed these taste buds that pizza just hits everything that you like.
[132:26.93]And I feel like it's impossible to not enjoy the taste of pizza.
[132:32.70]Tomato sauce has that savory on your savory taste buds.
[132:37.32]Cheese hits you.
[132:38.08]You know what I mean?
[132:39.02]I feel like it's impossible.
[132:41.18]I've never been hit by cheese.
[132:46.45]Humans were built to enjoy pizza.
[132:51.49]It's like our mouths were created to enjoy that flavor.
[132:58.10]Yeah, I think that's in the Bible.
[133:00.92]Yeah, when Jesus makes the pizza and serves it at the last supper.
[133:06.22]Are you good?
[133:11.18]Yeah.
[133:18.08]I'm gonna get a plate ready for you up here.
[133:19.30]In fact, I'm gonna get two plates ready.
[133:22.39]Don't be mad at me.
[133:24.81]I'm mad.
[133:29.95]Okay, so here's the issue.
[133:32.71]They want onion and not onion.
[133:35.37]Do I gotta cook two pizzas?
[133:36.97]Do I gotta cook fucking two pizzas right now?
[133:39.42]Yep, I think so.
[133:41.42]I can't just put half on a pie.
[133:43.52]Like a fucking competent human being.
[133:45.74]We can't.
[133:49.49]I'm going to move this out of the way temporarily.
[133:50.97]Thank you.
[133:52.03]Does this person want onion?
[133:53.53]Alright.
[133:54.07]Do not ask him.
[133:55.24]We've got an onion.
[133:55.92]We've got an onion.
[133:56.60]We're good.
[133:56.96]Okay.
[133:57.76]What if he didn't want an onion?
[133:58.92]What if he wanted... That was a gamble I was willing to take.
[134:01.10]What if he wanted to see me dance in my cat outfit?
[134:04.34]Then... I don't know.
[134:05.94]But he wanted onion.
[134:07.90]And I... The second you get me that other one, we're good to go.
[134:11.69]Okay.
[134:13.05]Just going to make this happen really quickly.
[134:14.69]I know they're getting a little upset, but...
[134:16.93]uh we'd like to see the chef do a little bit of a dance in his cute little kitty cat outfit you're definitely you're the weird one like you you you are the weird one tonight I'm uh I'm role playing okay hold on we need uh they just want cheese yeah we should have enough there is yeah I'm gonna claim this plate we got another pie ready if it's onion or not onion double cheese

[135:21.81]I want some happy tummies leaving here.

[135:31.10]We need two cheese.
[135:33.00]Well, now I, now I need plates.
[135:35.54]You will in one second.
[135:38.43]Finish mine off with a little bit of oil.

[136:18.19]Reality TV.
[136:20.61]And it was recommended by my sister-in-law was saying that, um, what's the name of the show?
[136:24.85]The rich people on yachts fucking below deck.
[136:28.01]They like follow the crew of a yacht that need to like serve like rich pampered people.
[136:32.85]And I fucking loved the chef.
[136:34.51]Because like every time someone would order something he didn't like, he just like stopped.
[136:37.69]He's fucking idiots.
[136:40.17]So I'm channeling that a bit.
[136:41.67]What network is this on?
[136:43.91]Uh, on Bravo.
[136:49.22]Ooh, another counter.
[136:50.00]I know you like those.
[136:50.66]I think we have enough counters.
[136:53.76]Unless we want to throw another, like... There's actually no room for it.
[136:56.94]I guess we could.
[136:58.40]I could put it up in this corner.
[136:59.52]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[137:01.08]Rolling pin.
[137:02.48]Three times faster than rolling the dough?
[137:05.15]Uh, it rolls really fast.
[137:06.11]I don't think we need that.
[137:08.25]That's, like, the fastest part of the process.
[137:10.45]Okay.
[137:11.99]So, I mean... I'm going to get the extra counter.
[137:14.97]Where are you going to put it?
[137:18.81]Let me do my thing here, darling.
[137:21.85]I'm going to put these here.
[137:22.95]Because honestly, I feel like I'm running in here way too much.
[137:26.68]Is that a good spot, though?
[137:29.98]Can I switch it?
[137:30.86]Yeah, I can get it.
[137:36.54]We need the research desk.
[137:39.14]I have no idea what it does.
[137:41.00]What does it do?
[137:41.70]Where do we put it?
[137:44.31]Like, what is it for?
[137:45.37]It says it upgrades the thing on a cabinet next to it.
[137:48.35]What should we put it next to?
[137:51.56]I don't know.
[137:52.14]I don't know.
[137:52.58]I haven't noticed it do anything.
[137:53.82]I tried to use it last game when I put it next to the cheese, but I guess that's not a cabinet.
[137:57.88]Put it next to the filing cabinet.
[137:59.12]It's saying filing cabinet, filing cabinet.
[138:01.22]Oh, well, then we'll move the cheese.
[138:03.30]Oh, it is doing something.
[138:04.38]What is it doing, though?
[138:05.62]It researches.
[138:06.44]It has to be next to a filing cabinet.
[138:09.99]Oh.
[138:11.33]Okay, thanks.
[138:12.49]Okay.
[138:13.49]I'm going to try this new plate setup.
[138:15.35]Okay, we're good.
[138:17.15]Ooh, you know, that's looking pretty nasty.
[138:20.43]Let's go.
[138:24.36]One pizza coming up, my little pizzeria.
[138:28.34]In my pepperoni.
[138:33.12]Welcome, welcome, welcome to our store.
[138:38.00]Alright, sliced cheese.
[138:38.62]How come they never want two slices?
[138:44.09]How many slices do you eat, sir?
[138:46.71]Oh, I eat like the whole fucking pie.
[138:49.49]I honestly, true.
[138:52.14]I will look at how much I've eaten from a box of pizza and go, oh, oops.
[138:58.70]I'd say, I'd say I on average eat like 75% of the pizza.
[139:04.20]That's a lot, but I mean, yeah, I can see that.
[139:07.14]Alright, let's see this one.
[139:09.42]We just cheese right now.
[139:15.44]No onion.
[139:16.06]No onions yet.
[139:21.21]No onions.
[139:23.03]Just regular cheese still.
[139:26.87]I'm working on it.
[139:27.53]Just need one more.
[139:33.25]oh you best believe this pizza is coming up this is my best pizza yet this might be my magnum opus of pizzas okay thank you no onion at the moment let's see we do have an onion now one cheese one onion one onion required here's that onion for you sir
[140:10.90]Pretty good.
[140:11.62]Just one slice of cheese over there.
[140:14.28]Get that in a second.
[140:15.92]Pretty smooth.
[140:21.62]We need one cheese, one onion.
[140:28.12]You know what?
[140:28.44]We should open our own pizzeria for real.
[140:32.48]Um...
[140:35.27]That seems like not a great idea.
[140:37.79]Do you know anything about making pizza?
[140:40.17]I know you know a lot about eating pizza, but do you know about making pizza?
[140:44.72]I make pizzas now and again.
[140:45.98]I enjoy making a nice pizza.
[140:47.96]It's pretty simple.
[140:48.62]Do you have a big paddle that you use?
[140:52.06]I think that would make it more fun.
[140:55.67]The big spatula paddle?
[140:58.05]Yeah.
[140:58.57]Doesn't that just seem awesome?
[140:59.87]How powerful you'd feel using that?
[141:03.60]Yeah, you get nice- Alright, but hold on.
[141:05.22]We have to figure this out because I have a kind of a way that I like pizza.
[141:09.35]You probably have a way that you like pizza.
[141:11.41]but it's about the customers are we like we're basing this around our personal taste and they come in for like the authentic germaria well because you need to you need to you know how much you like certain pizza you know how you want it to taste what's your pizza toppings what are you putting on your pizza well I I wouldn't make a deep dish pizza place I don't really like it and I don't really know about it right I my pizza thin New York style crust super crispy um not a whole lot of grease
[141:38.24]Super, super crunchy.
[141:40.10]That's my favorite pizza, super thin.
[141:42.35]What's going on it?
[141:44.85]I mean, honestly, either just cheese or pepperoni.
[141:50.55]And I'm talking, like, you get this shit so thin that those places where they throw it into the oven, and it's in there for 60 seconds.
[141:58.31]Like, so thin and so crispy, you could cut someone's throat with it.
[142:03.19]I don't know why that's where you're going with this, but, I mean, no.
[142:05.69]Pfft.
[142:09.19]a little bit a little bit of give but right okay so not not that okay let me do it let me show you like you know I'm talking about when you do that like you bite and then you bite bite you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah you that first bite you bite bite bite that's my favorite kind of pizza have you never had deep dish or like I've had it's just a lasagna you don't like it it's a it's a lasagna it's a lasagna a deep dish pizza is a lasagna to me
[142:36.45]I don't think that there's like bread in a lasagna.
[142:40.16]But it's just like a bunch of sauce.
[142:41.66]It's a lasagna.
[142:42.24]There's a bunch of cheese, tons of cheese, tons of sauce.
[142:44.62]It's like thick.
[142:45.68]I could eat it with a fork and knife.
[142:46.86]It's a lasagna.
[142:49.09]Okay.
[142:49.67]I respect that.
[142:51.09]I don't dislike it.
[142:53.77]Deep dish pizza tastes really great.
[142:56.01]I just don't... It's more... Growing up in the 90s, my family really wanted to believe that they were Italian because The Sopranos was very popular.
[143:07.27]So they would get Sicilian pies pretty often.
[143:11.41]That's a good guy.
[143:12.79]It is.
[143:13.21]But that's basically deep dish.
[143:16.75]That's not like deep dish Chicago style pizza.
[143:21.81]That Sicilian kind of... You're talking about like the square slices, right?
[143:24.57]Yeah.
[143:25.75]That's not deep dish.
[143:26.83]That literally is like deep dish.
[143:30.57]How is it not?
[143:31.66]It's just like a better... It's just better.
[143:35.16]But it's deep dish.
[143:36.72]Well, deep... Yeah, Sicilian is... It's not?
[143:42.56]It's not?
[143:43.29]No, it's not.
[143:43.81]See, I don't know because I only like... We weren't actually Italian.
[143:48.25]There's a lot of different kinds of pizza that you think, oh, pizza's all the same.
[143:53.26]There's like a dozen at least versions of different pizza.
[143:57.38]There's like Chicago style, Detroit style.
[143:59.86]There's Connecticut.
[144:01.08]Why don't we make up our own style?
[144:02.79]We go like Jerma style and like we franchise it.
[144:07.23]And everyone would know like, oh, I don't like Chicago.
[144:09.57]I like the Jerma Rumble pizza or whatever you would call it.
[144:12.97]So you want us to be like a kid's restaurant?
[144:15.56]No, like we could come up with like a whole new take on what pizza is.
[144:19.60]And there's whipped cream and there's anchovies and there's sausages.
[144:22.52]No, no, no.
[144:23.12]We're just talking about the bake style.
[144:25.28]There's got to be like an undiscovered bake style.
[144:28.36]I don't think so.
[144:29.53]I think it's, I mean, maybe this is like a new twist, but I don't know anything about baking food.
[144:33.91]Well, that's why we got the research desk going on up here.
[144:36.39]Alright.
[144:37.69]But to answer the question, so what is your, it's like that Sicilian or Detroit style.
[144:42.65]Is that what you like?
[144:44.83]Uh, I mean... I think I only would like it if I was near, like, an authentic place that was like, we make Sicilian pies.
[144:51.33]We do it good.
[144:52.15]Otherwise, like, I'm out here in Texas.
[144:54.07]Like, everything is a chain restaurant.
[144:56.07]There's no real food.
[144:57.26]It was all made, like, a year ago.
[144:59.94]So I'll make the thin crust kind of Connecticut or New York kind of style pizza.
[145:04.02]And you do the, like, Detroit style.
[145:05.62]We have two different ovens.
[145:06.36]We'll just have two.
[145:06.96]We'll just compete with each other and see who sells more.
[145:09.04]Yeah, the competing ovens.
[145:10.46]And you come in, you gotta, like, put a ballot in.
[145:14.21]We'll just be the Twix brothers, but we're in the same restaurant.
[145:16.81]So, okay.
[145:17.09]So imagine this, you walk into the restaurant and it's kind of like, I'll describe it as a hallway on the left is your pizzeria on the right is my pizzeria.
[145:24.88]And like, we're shouting at each other across like
[145:27.80]Like, you can come up to order from me or him, and, like, if someone comes up to order at yours, like, hey, what do you want?
[145:31.77]What do you want?
[145:32.15]What are those pizzas for?
[145:32.99]We got the best.
[145:33.77]You know, and I try and, like, haggle them, like, I'll give you $5 one pizza.
[145:37.47]I don't know how prices.
[145:38.39]No, we're not fighting over who gets more.
[145:40.95]I'm just saying we could have two different styles.
[145:42.27]No, I think it would be a really cool environment to, like, sit in the middle of, like, two arguing people trying to make better pizzas and serve you better.
[145:49.90]Yeah, but what if somebody comes in and they want... You could get, like, one pie from one side, one pie from the other side, and, like, we're getting all upset about it.
[145:56.48]But I'm never gonna argue to somebody that comes in wanting a Detroit-style pizza to eat a New York or Connecticut-style pizza.
[146:03.84]They've already come in and they already know what they want, so they're gonna go to you.
[146:06.05]Okay, but you could try and convince them that they're wrong.
[146:15.02]Oh, hey, I love Detroit-style pizza.
[146:17.11]Oh, this place does Detroit-style pizza.
[146:18.97]I'm going in there.
[146:19.61]That sounds great.
[146:20.27]New place?
[146:20.71]What does it got on Yelp?
[146:21.45]Oh, like 4.3?
[146:23.03]I'll try it.
[146:23.65]And then they walk in and I go, Connecticut-style pizzas better eat mine.
[146:28.26]You don't want his pizzas.
[146:29.16]He's got cockroaches in his pizzas.
[146:30.60]You want my pizzas.
[146:31.68]They're just not gonna, they're just gonna be, they're just gonna be like a dickhead.
[146:33.82]They're gonna be like, that guy's an asshole.
[146:37.75]4.3 on Yelp, Omega LOL, that's good.
[146:39.45]That's part of the environment.
[146:40.75]That's just the environment.
[146:41.75]People are Omega LoLing 4.3 on Yelp, bro?
[146:49.44]That's a high, high score on Yelp.
[146:52.56]Okay, well then, it sounds like you're not in on this.
[146:56.68]I mean, what, you want to do a stream where we make pizzas and compete and rent out space in New York City?
[147:02.57]Is this what you want to do?
[147:04.77]didn't we actually like 20 years ago say it would be like funny to take like cooking classes yeah that was this was like a thing it was that was immediately dropped it was like totally not ever gonna happen I mean it sounds kind of fun yeah maybe we have a lot of the hallway pizzeria I would call it the pizza gauntlet
[147:38.22]You have to sign a waiver before you come in, because we can get rough.
[147:44.12]Yeah, let's just save our money, man.
[147:45.72]What, like, fucking frisbeeing the pan the pizza goes on at each other?
[147:49.43]What are you talking about?
[147:51.27]I don't know, like, there could be, um... I don't know, like, anything could happen.
[147:56.25]It's just like, you frisbee it at me, and it just perfect spiral, that big pizza pan just hits me right in the forehead.
[148:03.58]And if it's crispy enough, again, you could really break the skin.
[148:09.43]As is in your grandmother's pizza shop.
[148:12.21]So essentially, you just want to you just want to make a mess for a few hours is what you want to do.
[148:16.51]I think I don't think it has to be a mess.
[148:18.47]I just think the I like you know how you OK, imagine this.
[148:21.21]You're going out to eat.
[148:21.87]You're going to a nice restaurant.
[148:23.47]You're with your family and like the waiter comes over.
[148:26.12]It's like, oh, what would you like?
[148:27.74]Everything's nice and proper.
[148:29.14]Where can you go to just like eat but also get totally fucked up?
[148:35.63]and just to be like scared and like a little bit on edge and like looking around but it's like a it's like fun it's like you're not actually gonna get jumped like it's the other people that are like people are saying Waffle House
[148:49.35]How many people watch people arguing on TikTok or these YouTube, like, oh, this guy was freaking out and this Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[148:57.25]It's crazy.
[148:57.73]It would be like that every day, but it would just be us doing it.
[149:00.82]But do you want a Medieval Times restaurant with actors?
[149:06.26]What do you mean?
[149:06.78]I mean, in a sense, I guess we are acting through the competition of our pies.
[149:13.97]So you're talking about, like, hey, when you come in here and sit down and eat.
[149:16.74]No, no, no.
[149:17.52]You're breaking the illusion.
[149:19.08]We're actively trying to hurt each other.
[149:20.66]You and I are actively trying to hurt each other.
[149:22.42]And people are, like, in here.
[149:24.14]It's like wrestling.
[149:26.16]Like WWF competition pies.
[149:29.95]And, like, we're putting on, like, a show.
[149:31.69]Like, some people are like, is this real?
[149:33.05]I don't know what's going on.
[149:33.89]You know, and, like, we're going to be making their food.
[149:37.37]But also, it's like WWF.
[149:38.91]Fighting each other.
[149:40.66]We don't have to, like, physically fight, but we're definitely gonna be in verbal arguments.
[149:44.54]There could be things being thrown.
[149:46.19]So I- I send out, like, this guy, like, you know, like, Louie comes out to, like, to, like, go fight you or something.
[149:51.67]He's got, like, a- Yeah, and then- then I send out my goon, and he's, like, fucking Louie or something.
[149:56.21]And they just- And then they just, like, brawl.
[149:59.37]PvP pizza restaurant?
[150:03.08]Yeah, kinda. It's like a theater. It's like food and a show - like every day at 6:30 we do the same bit where like we've practiced this for years where we like toss pies across the room.
[150:12.08]And like you catch it and throw it back and it's spinning and I catch and I twirl and I put it down on the- you know when I start cooking- you know what I'm saying?
[150:19.08]But you- if you're doing Detroit style pizza if I throw my dough over there it's gonna ruin your entire thing.
[150:23.08]Yeah but event- eventually it comes back to you and then like-
[150:26.08]PVPizza.
[150:28.11]It's the combo pizza.
[150:29.15]We do one combo pizza a day, 6.30.
[150:31.01]It's a whole bit.
[150:31.95]And like, it's the best pie.
[150:33.39]You got to get, you got to be there at 6.30.
[150:35.10]And I got to come up, I got to come up with my fully done pie to the customer and be like, okay, here you go guys.
[150:40.52]I know you, and you come up from behind me and you do the thing.
[150:43.38]You like grab my head and smash my head into the pizza.
[150:46.42]Yeah.
[150:46.90]And like it, like, like a cake.
[150:49.19]And to be clear, I'm not doing Detroit style.
[150:51.39]I'm not like Connecticut, whatever you're, I'm doing cat style.
[150:54.21]I'm doing the fucking whole cat, like maid outfit.
[150:58.62]cafe type cat style pizza yeah it's gonna be like you know my own little twist alright let's alright sounds good are we ready are we ready for another uh group
[151:18.46]I'm just imagining you doing that to me, and I'm like, with, like, pizza sauce all over my face, and, like, there's, like, five to ten cuts in the, like, at that moment, and you show, like, a close-up of somebody's face that's looking around, like, oh my god, and that's really, really intense music is being played, like, that, like, reality TV music.
[151:35.41]Mm-hmm.
[151:38.70]And then that, like it cuts to Louis in the back, he's like taking off his fucking gloves, he's throwing them down, he's like, I can't believe he fucking did that.
[151:44.82]That fucking piece of shit.
[151:46.28]And he walks out there, and he's like, now it's time for a brawl.
[151:49.76]Everyone likes watching Gordon Ramsay, where they do like the Hell's Kitchen, and they cook in front of everyone.
[151:54.46]Like, you know, it's like, oh man, this seems kind of an intense environment.
[151:58.68]It's like that, just every day, but like staged.
[152:01.77]Like, is that that crazy?
[152:02.77]Can we get some fucking order, so I know if I'm putting onions on these motherfuckers?
[152:05.67]I mean, it'd be funny for probably like 10 minutes.
[152:09.88]Alright, well then, like, you'll come back when you want some more.
[152:11.88]Dude, we would go through an elaborate thing, and then it'd be like, oh, shit, we still have, like, four hours of stream to fill.
[152:20.51]Can you focus?
[152:21.31]We will die if you don't get these orders right.
[152:27.27]Dude, the second that I take a steel pizza pan across the head, I'm probably gonna need a few minutes.
[152:33.59]That's it.
[152:35.24]Okay, okay, okay.
[152:35.84]We need two cheese and one... Help me with this for a second or two.
[152:42.06]What?
[152:43.18]With pizzas and cleaning.
[152:47.61]We got people waiting at the door.
[152:48.47]I need your help.
[152:49.07]Forget about anything else.
[152:51.07]I know.
[152:55.53]That guy needs plate immediately, immediately, immediately.
[152:58.65]Where?
[152:59.07]Where?
[152:59.53]What does he want?
[153:00.06]What does this guy want?
[153:02.70]What food does that guy want?
[153:05.34]Okay.
[153:06.38]No, it's over.
[153:06.88]It's over.
[153:07.20]It's over.
[153:08.72]It might not be if you... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[153:12.36]We're okay.
[153:13.44]Oh, my God.
[153:14.04]I need one cheese, one cheese, one cheese, one cheese, one cheese.
[153:16.85]One cheese.
[153:17.27]This piece is black.
[153:24.41]One onion.
[153:25.27]Get the one onion.
[153:26.05]Get this one onion.
[153:26.57]I need to put this down.
[153:28.15]Get this one onion.
[153:28.85]Oh, shit.
[153:29.15]Louie's taking his gloves off.
[153:31.13]Oh, Louie's coming.
[153:38.93]We were too busy fucking talking about fighting in a restaurant, and that's what happens.
[153:42.41]It's okay.
[153:48.62]I feel like that was all.
[153:50.30]I made the pies.
[153:51.08]The pies were ready.
[153:51.90]But you got me on a topic, and I just... Nothing else is important.
[153:59.70]See, I was up here.
[154:00.92]I wouldn't even sit in the chair anymore.
[154:03.05]I was just up here, sitting on a sofa.
[154:08.21]Let's take this one, Shark Tank.
[154:15.80]Stop pretending.
[154:19.50]Alright.
[154:20.06]We're doing... This is my turn to cook.
[154:22.96]Your turn to cook?
[154:23.71]Okay.
[154:23.91]We're doing salad.
[154:24.91]Wow, things are actually going to get plated.
[154:28.72]I hope you can handle the incredibly difficult put lettuce on a plate dish you're going to be serving up.
[154:35.65]You picked the hard one.
[154:36.75]That's not my fault.
[154:39.71]The pizzas were coming out.
[154:41.07]The pizzas were out.
[154:43.23]But then you were talking about a funny scenario and I... Sorry, I'll be less entertaining this one.
[154:51.04]The name of the restaurant, Lettuce Entertain You, that's going to have to change.
[154:54.64]Um...
[155:12.98]Alright, we ready?
[155:15.72]Ready for a service?
[155:19.63]I'm ready, I know what to do.
[155:20.87]I know what I'm doing.
[155:25.45]Okay.
[155:28.15]Can you make a salad?
[155:30.13]Alright, so how do you want to communicate this?
[155:34.58]I'll say one salad and I'll say tomato when it needs tomato.
[155:40.24]You really are the voices guy today.
[155:41.70]It's not me.
[155:42.32]Tomato, tomato, tomato, tomato.
[155:44.70]I need a tomato.
[155:45.58]Oh, it looks like a long walk to get those tomatoes.
[155:49.76]Hold on.
[155:51.71]I think you enjoy your tomatoes, sir.
[155:55.31]The most disgusting vegetable.
[155:57.95]I'm telling you.
[156:00.27]Wait, you don't like tomatoes?
[156:01.01]Neither do I. If you put tomatoes on a fucking sandwich, why?
[156:06.62]Why?
[156:08.91]Hey, can we get some grass?
[156:11.38]Grass, thank you, grass.
[156:12.24]You and I finally completely agree on something.
[156:14.84]I mean like 100% agree.
[156:16.06]Completely.
[156:19.26]Finally, after all these years, we've agreed on one thing.
[156:23.18]I'm not a big fan of tomatoes on very much.
[156:25.37]It has no taste and it's just mushy water.
[156:28.17]Tomatoes are amazing on some things, but not on... I don't really like it.
[156:32.43]Why did you do that?
[156:33.85]We need one tomato.
[156:36.20]Sabotaging.
[156:38.42]And is this my fault or yours?
[156:40.10]Are you going to blame me for this?
[156:41.42]It would have been done already.
[156:42.38]Let me tell you, if I touched your pizza, you would have screamed at the top of your head.
[156:47.99]You would have been like...
[157:04.11]You would've screamed at me, and I would've been like, oh shit, he's mad.
[157:07.13]Two tomatoes!
[157:15.59]Get outta here!
[157:16.79]I'm trying to help!
[157:18.26]Get outta- and he's in the way!
[157:25.96]You're just so used to being up here in the kitchen that you're like, okay, now I'm gonna get up there and do everything.
[157:37.29]Oh, it's because it's slow service.
[157:39.19]You're trying to.
[157:42.47]We need to we need to rearrange.
[157:43.97]This is a disaster.
[157:45.45]This is terrible.
[157:47.86]I will handle.
[157:48.62]I don't know.
[157:53.52]Good.
[157:56.72]Let's just like speed run.
[158:00.51]The starting.
[158:01.91]Yeah, I mean, honestly, here's one counter.
[158:03.57]The first two, three days are absolutely on.
[158:07.34]It's impossible to lose.
[158:10.76]Here, give me I'm going to take the sink outside.
[158:14.02]Um, can you give me the plates?
[158:23.90]I feel like I'm way too far away.
[158:29.22]Well, when I have clean plates, I'll just place them here for you.
[158:33.48]Okay.
[158:33.60]Does that make sense?
[158:34.58]Yeah.
[158:34.76]Let's try this.
[158:35.22]Let's try a service like this.
[158:37.74]I know people like to go out to a restaurant where, like, instead of watching the food being made, they get to watch the, like, the dish guy just clean the dishes right next to their table.
[158:47.21]I think it's, like, a new, like, thing they're doing in LA.
[158:49.29]Can I have a plate?
[158:56.43]Hey, one tomato.
[159:02.50]Wonder Barrel!
[159:30.36]Man, if we could just get customers in the door.
[159:32.78]I got the best salad in New York.
[159:43.55]How's this flowing for you?
[159:44.97]This is good.
[159:52.05]That's not quite, that's not an accolade.
[159:58.33]I got the best salad in New York.
[160:02.49]I mean, when you have a really good farm close by.
[160:04.55]You know, I was like, since 1903.
[160:05.43]Best salad.
[160:05.83]I need a plate.
[160:37.59]when I was really young I had my own very special methods of uh cooking like Eggo waffles okay alright like you know like oh first you like butter it then you like put in the microwave or then you toast it then you put in the microwave so it gets like softer and I was like man I should like when I'm older I'll be able to open my own restaurant I've never seen a restaurant where someone like makes you Eggo waffles and Eggo waffles are fucking awesome
[161:03.12]Like, you get, like, Pop-Tarts and other stuff like that.
[161:05.34]Do you like, like, real waffles made in a waffle maker?
[161:11.04]Yeah.
[161:12.02]Because, I mean, those are... If you like Eggo waffles, you could, you know, just take the next step up.
[161:18.08]Well, no, I'm saying this was, like, I was really, really young.
[161:21.27]I know.
[161:23.73]I guess as a little kid... It wasn't like Eggo waffles are better than, like, a legitimately made Belgian waffle.
[161:28.39]I'm, like, making fun of your child palate.
[161:31.95]Man, you could have stepped it up, little kid.
[161:36.82]We're looking for a sink, a counter.
[161:38.46]Is everything going well?
[161:39.44]We saved the money.
[161:40.22]Buy some big stuff later.
[161:41.78]Reemptively get a counter in case we don't see one later.
[161:44.84]Do you like... Yeah, I think you can get another counter in there.
[161:52.10]But I like what?
[161:54.66]So Eggo waffles, what are the ones where they're... It's four smaller little waffles.
[161:59.21]They're individual big waffles that they shrunk.
[162:01.77]What are those called?
[162:03.29]I can't remember.
[162:03.93]Just like minis.
[162:04.87]Those are better than the regular waffles.
[162:08.47]Those are better than regular Eggo waffles.
[162:10.85]I like the cinnamon toast Eggo waffles where it's like two and they look like breads.
[162:16.45]I haven't had those in a long while.
[162:19.36]Here, do you want this?
[162:19.98]You want this?
[162:21.32]Want this?
[162:22.32]Want this?
[162:22.84]I need plates.
[162:23.28]Oh, you need a plate?
[162:24.36]I need plates up here.
[162:27.16]I could just... Yeah, I don't have plates.
[162:34.66]It's a fucking disaster.
[162:36.02]I don't have plates up here.
[162:38.04]Uh, we need two grass.
[162:40.98]There it is.
[162:58.46]There's a door in the front, you know.
[163:01.66]But I feel like that would have taken longer.
[163:09.19]Not so easy, is it?
[163:10.23]That's pretty easy.
[163:30.88]I want to clean this.
[163:31.84]How come I can't clean stuff?
[163:35.82]I don't know.
[163:36.55]That's weird.
[163:44.35]I really do feel like the difficulty hits a point for us where like I think we're supposed to have a third person.
[163:54.43]Oh my god.
[163:54.87]I can't get around them.
[163:56.19]I cannot get around these people.
[163:58.00]There we go.
[163:59.96]You got it?
[164:01.63]yeah it's funny there's already a plate there for you a little funny you think you're better than me?
[164:27.57]you think because you're in the kitchen now you're better than me?
[164:29.09]oh nice tomato on a plate
[164:31.36]We need a regular.
[164:32.62]I have it right there.
[164:33.42]When was the last time you called out a single order, by the way?
[164:37.28]I feel like you're putting either leaves on a plate or leaves and a tomato on a plate.
[164:43.08]Do I really need to call them out when they're sitting right there in front of you and you can see?
[164:49.44]What is that emote of my fucking gourmet dinner?
[164:53.16]Oh, right.
[164:53.58]That's a new sub emote.
[164:58.41]uh adds olives and onions as a salad topping yeah give it to me alright do you want to practice it just in case there's like some weird thing add chopped onion or olives onto a prepared salad I think that's all I need to know okay onions or olives
[165:23.80]Okay, so that's olives.
[165:26.76]I gotta get this in a... Let me put this in the right order, though.
[165:28.66]Because I know I'll freak out if I don't.
[165:32.77]Lettuce.
[165:34.11]Tomato.
[165:36.21]Onion.
[165:37.17]Olive.
[165:39.81]And everything needs to be chopped.
[165:40.69]Okay, I'm good.
[165:44.09]Unless you want to add something.
[165:46.35]We can do research desk.
[165:49.25]Actually, I need plates or a sink up here.
[165:52.35]I would like to do the research desk successfully one time to start that and see what happens.
[165:59.38]Though, you need another counter, you said?
[166:01.24]Fuck you.
[166:02.44]Not a counter.
[166:04.16]I just need access to plates.
[166:07.08]You have to give me a plate every time.
[166:12.57]That's kind of an issue, don't you think?
[166:18.80]Is it?
[166:19.94]Yeah, give me the plates.
[166:24.22]Or maybe put them like... Put them in... If you're going to do that, then might as well... Do you have enough counter space?
[166:34.11]Yeah.
[166:35.29]With these four.
[166:36.97]And this one down here.
[166:38.49]Trust me on the plates, man.
[166:39.87]Just trust me on the plates.
[166:41.89]Okay.
[166:43.51]I trust you.
[166:45.09]Research desk.
[166:45.79]Research desk.
[166:46.41]Okay, now we got one.
[166:50.67]Cool.
[166:50.79]Sink in cabinet.
[166:53.57]Wait.
[166:54.07]Avoid that.
[166:54.45]Wait a minute.
[166:54.79]There's a sink here.
[166:55.51]I can put a... But how would you... You wouldn't be able to get in here.
[166:58.43]If I... Where would a sink go over here?
[167:00.88]Corner?
[167:02.26]You could block the door.
[167:03.18]Yeah, but what if you... If you block the door, it turns into a counter that we can pass stuff over.
[167:08.84]It does?
[167:09.92]Yeah.
[167:10.46]Oh, that's actually better.
[167:11.28]Let's do that.
[167:17.28]That's 100 times better.
[167:18.98]Yeah.
[167:20.76]So also, if I'm really in a bad situation, I can put some dirty plates here for you.
[167:25.37]Yeah.
[167:27.57]Okay.
[167:27.83]Okay.
[167:30.65]Alright.
[167:31.33]I am ready to start off a fantastic service here in slow service.
[167:36.50]Welcome.
[167:36.94]Welcome.
[167:37.40]Welcome, everyone.
[167:38.08]Would you like to watch me wash some dirty dishes for you?
[167:41.51]Oh, coming right up.
[167:42.38]We need a salad with onions on it.
[167:45.46]A salad with onions and olives.
[167:48.44]I need plates.
[167:51.06]Trust me with the plates, bro.
[167:53.86]Onions, and that's it?
[167:55.39]And then onions and olives, you said?
[167:57.09]Yes.
[168:05.17]Okay, you don't need to chop those.
[168:06.11]Okay.
[168:14.90]works oh my god those guys ate salads and how much how dirty is that it needs uh it works onions olives and tomatoes it works it works I need a plate
[168:42.53]Uh, one grass, one with everything.
[168:45.61]I got it.
[168:45.93]I see a plate.
[168:48.71]Is it one grass?
[169:08.07]Yep.
[169:08.61]Got it.
[169:13.58]Cool, cool, cool.
[169:15.94]Two with everything.
[169:17.66]Got it.
[169:19.43]One plate for you.
[169:25.55]Nice moves, dude.
[169:26.35]I saw that.
[169:27.07]I fucking saw that, dude.
[169:28.45]I respect it.
[169:37.24]Don't take them both.
[169:43.04]I'm ready for the next one.
[169:43.76]Whenever you're ready.
[169:44.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[169:49.48]Two grass.
[169:50.75]Two grass, that's it?
[169:52.09]Two grass.
[169:58.87]Plate coming up.
[170:14.24]One with everything, one grass.
[170:20.94]One grass.
[170:28.44]Survey set.
[170:35.56]Hey, look at that.
[170:37.00]Ooh, solid service.
[170:40.98]looking good I think I can put more dirty plates up there for you yeah the the issue that I'm having with this setup is the fact that there's so many ingredients that I'm gonna run out of counter space eventually I need I you know what I need counters on the right I think also I can probably just put dirty plates straight into your sink I should do that more often drop a dirty plate in there I'll wash it when does our research pay off like what what is happening
[171:10.13]I think I'm going to move this too.
[171:12.23]I want this like over here.
[171:13.93]Easier to get to and grab it.
[171:16.82]We got another counter.
[171:19.58]You know what?
[171:19.90]Yeah, I'll take another counter right here.
[171:21.84]Right to the right.
[171:22.70]Put blueprint in the filing cabinet.
[171:24.38]Blueprint in the filing cabinet.
[171:27.91]Blueprint in the filing cabinet.
[171:31.12]do we put a blueprint from the ground into the filing cabinet like if I put a sink in it yeah put a blueprint into the filing cabinet it will upgrade it oh my god that would have been useful information 30 hours ago yeah that would have been good if we can get an omega sink out here that would be huge actually uh I think this is a good counter space for me
[171:55.71]got sinks we are gonna run into plates there we're at the extra plates I'm gonna put these in here just in case that's the just in case emergency plates everybody use the desk like use the desk so I have to go over here and it's a thing that we have to actually use it to do it we have to research it
[172:21.39]You have to interact with the research desk.
[172:23.84]Okay.
[172:24.36]Alright.
[172:25.06]So that's how it's a challenge.
[172:27.16]So if you got nothing going on, Ster, we have to fill this thing up during the day.
[172:34.40]Okay.
[172:35.65]He's reading chat.
[172:36.15]Okay.
[172:39.63]Let's go for it.
[172:43.51]Okay.
[172:43.67]While you're preparing the first meal, I'll be on this.
[172:46.31]You got it.
[172:53.76]Oh, that's all it takes.
[172:54.52]Where can I go again?
[172:55.80]Okay, that's it.
[172:57.34]Oh, I like this line you got going.
[173:01.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.
[173:03.16]Uh, one with everything, one grass.
[173:06.36]Uh, is that actually everything?
[173:08.02]Is it?
[173:08.50]I don't see tomato on that.
[173:09.22]Oh, no tomato, no tomato.
[173:10.20]One with no tomato.
[173:13.62]And olive.
[173:16.62]My bad, a little bit, one miscommunication and you fucking die.
[173:21.96]Good thing I got these fucking eagle eyes.
[173:25.02]Hawk, man.
[173:25.84]Why do you even need me?
[173:30.22]Tomato, olive.
[173:31.04]I need some plates.
[173:33.14]I got you.
[173:33.69]I got you.
[173:34.35]Just say plates.
[173:39.43]You said just tomato and olive?
[173:42.17]Yeah.
[173:46.11]Got it.
[173:50.20]Two grass.
[173:50.60]Easy.
[173:51.20]Easy.
[174:08.66]One grass, one tomato.
[174:09.58]Look at this.
[174:31.17]Look at this.
[174:31.63]Look at us here.
[174:33.09]We're insane.
[174:34.51]One with everything, one with onions.
[174:42.88]I just need a plate.
[174:59.59]One grass, one tomato.
[175:09.92]Boom.
[175:11.24]Bingo.
[175:11.76]That worked out pretty well.
[175:23.68]Yeah, that was our best service yet.
[175:26.86]I think we're going to get a raise.
[175:27.82]So what do we do here?
[175:29.44]I would love... Standards aren't as important or people will wait a long time.
[175:42.03]What do you think?
[175:46.09]Um, I think exclusive.
[175:47.73]I think a lot of the ones we've lost have been because someone's waiting outside.
[175:51.16]Yeah, it's true.
[175:57.78]Oof.
[175:58.02]Alright, we got a lot of stuff.
[176:05.35]Highly flammable rug.
[176:08.11]Ooh.
[176:08.61]Painting.
[176:09.13]Add a little bit of danger.
[176:10.53]We only have 70 coins, though.
[176:21.46]Uh, yeah.
[176:21.82]I think we should... Ooh, the sink.
[176:23.94]Check the sink.
[176:26.30]Can we... Do we have to go in the filing cabinet?
[176:32.56]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[176:33.22]Oh, wash basin.
[176:37.29]ooh washes up to four plates at once oh we're on we're incredible we just unlocked the next level we just throw the sink away throw that sink in here with the other the emergency plates I don't know if you actually sell things for money or what okay I'm gonna get it yeah and we pop that one out in front oh hell yeah four plates can go in here are you kidding me you can upgrade it again
[177:03.80]Oh, that's cool.
[177:04.54]Let's upgrade something else.
[177:06.91]What do you use the most?
[177:10.75]What can be upgraded?
[177:13.67]What are those other envelopes you got in there?
[177:16.45]I mean, there is... We got... Chandelier.
[177:20.79]And whatever this is.
[177:26.13]Banner?
[177:26.96]Oh, well.
[177:28.46]That was free.
[177:30.94]It says if it can be upgraded.
[177:32.28]Okay.
[177:32.72]I don't think we have anything else.
[177:34.84]OK.
[177:34.98]I think we're good.
[177:40.12]Upgrade the counter?
[177:42.98]Wait.
[177:43.76]Yeah, I think we need the blueprint to put in there, not the actual thing.
[177:47.38]So I think we could reroll blueprints then start upgrading something.
[177:50.50]Might be.
[177:52.28]But I don't know.
[177:53.00]When you get to the stage, it just gives you all these random Christmas junk.
[177:55.94]Wait, people are saying the wash basin needs water.
[177:58.97]We need to put a sink next to it.
[178:01.79]Really?
[178:04.84]That's not a sink.
[178:05.82]We need to sink next to the sink.
[178:13.80]No, it doesn't.
[178:14.44]They are.
[178:14.98]Just keep that sink there.
[178:16.19]There's no reason not to have that in the corner.
[178:19.17]Now put that thing back.
[178:20.19]Put it back?
[178:21.31]Yeah.
[178:22.87]It's an empty space there.
[178:23.99]I can side put a plate in there.
[178:26.17]Okay.
[178:28.11]I'm good.
[178:28.85]Let's do it.
[178:40.33]Oh, good evening sir!
[178:41.69]Welcome to the place!
[178:45.82]Oh, a salad and one with tomatoes and onions.
[178:56.20]Okay.
[179:08.73]Okay!
[179:10.71]One with onions, one with everything.
[179:22.56]Wash, wash, wash, wash, wash, wash, wash.
[179:29.20]Grass and tomatoes and olives.
[179:35.64]Grass.
[179:39.67]And tomatoes.
[179:43.95]And olives.
[179:45.65]And then one with everything once you're done with that.
[179:53.33]And you said everything?
[179:54.87]Yep.
[180:04.81]Oh, look at that.
[180:07.49]Insane.
[180:07.99]And they all stay there.
[180:09.09]Insane.
[180:17.23]One with onions.
[180:18.78]We got somebody outside.
[180:19.68]Onion.
[180:32.47]You see.
[180:32.79]Yeah, you're good.
[180:37.36]Olives.
[180:38.36]One with just olives.
[180:41.79]You still good?
[180:49.54]Two grass.
[180:50.42]Easy.
[180:50.96]Easy.
[180:51.22]Easy.
[180:51.34]Very easy.
[180:51.86]Very easy.
[180:52.28]Two plates.
[180:52.56]Plates coming up.
[181:08.97]One with everything, one with tomatoes and onions.
[181:24.25]How come that guy left his whole plate of food?
[181:32.35]Uh, that was the one you made.
[181:33.11]I was holding it there.
[181:37.38]Just saving space so I don't have to run so... It's actually hard to get from this counter all the way to the bottom right table.
[181:43.15]Can we move it?
[181:44.51]It's a race against time.
[181:49.82]Slow service, but this is the best unironically that you guys have done.
[181:53.83]Because we're taking it slow.
[181:55.49]I think we also figured out that you can upgrade stuff.
[181:58.81]That helped a lot.
[181:59.99]I feel like that was a very important thing to know.
[182:04.56]Allows customers to change their order.
[182:06.60]That is a death sentence.
[182:09.34]I'm going straight to the gulag with that one.
[182:11.16]Oh, yeah, that's terrible.
[182:13.08]Pumpkin pie, though.
[182:14.12]I think they can change.
[182:17.18]It's just salads.
[182:18.20]Just keep it simple, right?
[182:19.65]You don't want to learn a whole pie.
[182:26.85]They're going to change it up.
[182:28.29]But the salads all look very similar, though.
[182:30.39]That's the problem.
[182:31.62]They do.
[182:34.00]Portioner.
[182:35.36]Automatically performs enter on things placed in front of it.
[182:42.02]Ooh, upgrade counter.
[182:45.88]And dining table.
[182:46.66]Should we make a bigger dining table?
[182:48.78]Or do counter?
[182:52.65]I would upgrade the counter, and I think we could...
[182:57.32]uh okay upgrade the counter yeah I don't think we need anything else we could even like what would we want at this point what are the work boots
[183:13.14]They are push through things easier, which I assume is like doors.
[183:16.67]I don't really need it.
[183:17.35]It's 60 monies.
[183:18.79]It's too much money.
[183:19.71]You think so?
[183:21.15]Yeah, I think we're fine.
[183:22.87]It's not movement speed.
[183:24.09]It's just push through things easier.
[183:25.85]I think it's better if the emergency plates are here next to me.
[183:29.38]So I don't have to go all the way down.
[183:30.34]Alright, cool.
[183:36.92]Alright, we good?
[183:37.64]Yep.
[183:55.29]Alright, what do they want?
[183:57.73]They want dog food!
[183:59.81]One with everything.
[184:02.57]I MADE IT IN THAT SOUP!
[184:03.95]Shop, it's alright.
[184:05.41]Slow down.
[184:05.92]Slow service.
[184:06.60]We're good.
[184:07.12]Everything's fine.
[184:22.80]Grab those.
[184:25.61]Remember, they can change their orders.
[184:28.53]One with olives, one with onions.
[184:35.35]One with olives, one with onions?
[184:37.45]Yes, sir.
[184:40.16]Done.
[184:45.22]One with olives.
[184:48.22]Got it.
[184:56.65]Oh, you gotta take that plate out.
[184:57.67]Wait, he changed it to grass.
[185:02.51]Oh, he did change it to grass.
[185:03.92]That bastard.
[185:05.22]Uh, let me figure out what these guys want.
[185:08.92]Want everything?
[185:09.34]Want tomatoes?
[185:16.15]Got it.
[185:24.44]One with olives, one with tomatoes and onions.
[185:33.95]I got the dishes.
[185:35.63]One with olives and one with tomatoes and onions.
[185:39.27]Yes, sir.
[185:39.97]Yes, sir.
[185:45.00]Oh, no!
[185:45.82]It was in the... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[185:50.90]Tomatoes and onions, right?
[185:54.02]Uh, tomatoes and onions and one with olives.
[185:55.78]Got it.
[185:56.66]Just one with onions.
[185:57.99]Or olives, olives, olives.
[185:59.85]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[186:04.55]Uh, two, uh, onions and tomato.
[186:10.15]Wait, what?
[186:10.55]Wait, what happened?
[186:11.19]Did you change?
[186:11.95]What?
[186:12.59]I got one right here!
[186:13.15]I got one right here!
[186:13.75]I got one!
[186:14.05]I got one!
[186:14.43]What?
[186:14.77]I don't even know what I did wrong.
[186:15.95]What happened?
[186:19.19]You got the wrong plate?
[186:20.17]What did happen?
[186:20.85]What happened?
[186:22.81]I think I put the wrong plate or something down.
[186:25.27]What happened?
[186:27.45]You gave them the blank plate?
[186:31.25]Oh, it all fell apart so quickly.
[186:32.81]No!
[186:33.67]We were doing so good!
[186:38.28]Oh, fuck.
[186:39.48]We unlocked medium size, though.
[186:45.46]You forgot you left the salad on the counter.
[186:49.66]grab an empty plate and take it to him and think I think you misclicked yeah I want I need to go again we're like we're like right there man I mean we we have a medium place now do you want a bigger one look at look at this one this one's pretty good let's go back to the classic classic steak you want to cook uh sure okay now that we know we can upgrade
[187:25.39]Turns out, changing the order actually kind of sucks because you have to constantly look for it.
[187:30.09]Yeah.
[187:30.89]It was really hard for me to, like, look and catch any of that.
[187:33.57]Especially the salad, because, like, the olives sometimes blend in, the onions... Yeah, that's hard.
[187:42.31]Okay, I don't know if you want the booking desk.
[187:47.14]Um... That's kind of hard mode.
[187:49.14]Maybe we just shouldn't do it.
[187:50.80]What's your title right now?
[187:54.28]Ster and I are having a breakdown.
[187:57.52]I'm having a break up.
[187:59.60]True.
[187:59.90]That's also bad.
[188:00.66]Never mind.
[188:01.34]No, not true.
[188:01.90]Not true.
[188:03.32]You set the tables where you want them.
[188:04.60]They're pretty spread out.
[188:05.58]You get them right in front here.
[188:11.96]Dude, they can sit up here.
[188:13.40]I messed this up.
[188:18.48]It's like they can do like bar seating.
[188:21.36]yeah there was like options on it too of like what it modified can you put it back hold on yeah what was that decreased patience increased mess so could you awful could you do that's awful but hold on can you just go like right from you could probably just serve them immediately if they sit there right
[188:46.54]Does that work?
[188:48.14]No, I don't think so, right?
[188:49.72]It sounded like all negatives other than how long it would take me to get to them.
[188:55.66]Can you put it on the other side?
[188:58.82]Wait, hold on.
[188:59.76]Swap it then.
[189:02.52]No.
[189:05.38]It does work.
[189:06.56]You have to remove the counter.
[189:08.48]Really?
[189:08.74]So they can just come sit in the kitchen?
[189:13.90]Becca,
[189:17.58]yeah I don't I don't want them in my get out of my grill in your space okay so I'm gonna put one here and then one over here like we just go bang bang could have outdoor seating can you that's a long way to go though maybe a little bit
[189:42.50]I'm so ready.
[189:43.32]You were just like back and forth, back and forth.
[189:45.31]I know because I wanted to be three and three.
[189:48.59]Okay.
[189:49.71]I believe you.
[189:50.21]There we go.
[189:51.37]Okay.
[189:51.65]I'm good.
[189:56.36]You ready to go, Steak Andy?
[189:59.64]Yeah.
[189:59.96]I'm going to have that there so you can put dishes straight in.
[190:02.48]It's the strat.
[190:04.50]Yeah.
[190:04.60]I'm going to go.
[190:12.49]um why are you putting stakes on immediately they okay alright okay we want a uh two wells go all the way I think I can handle a couple of stakes
[190:46.53]This person wants a rare.
[190:55.69]You made a bunch of mediums.
[191:00.45]Hey, why don't you take that on over to that customer right there?
[191:07.18]Oh, yeah.
[191:09.08]Why, when you go back there, do you start to talk like this?
[191:12.42]Oh, just having a nice little time cooking my food.
[191:14.96]Just keeping calm.
[191:19.72]This person wants a medium, which is right there.
[191:23.35]I think I can... Can I grab it from here?
[191:26.13]Kind of.
[191:26.45]You can.
[191:30.35]I wish you could, like, take down parts of the wall for this counter.
[191:35.17]Put this in the sink.
[191:36.25]I think we're done.
[191:40.48]Oh, one more fucking yokel.
[191:43.27]People are saying it's the Wolfman voice.
[191:45.31]It is.
[191:45.53]Rare.
[192:02.06]Golden rare.
[192:12.67]Why is there steak in the sink?
[192:14.30]Give it a little bit of extra juices.
[192:15.40]Alright, we just go.
[192:21.00]I think we just go.
[192:22.68]Just go?
[192:23.94]I mean, I think we just go.
[192:25.88]We don't have money for anything.
[192:31.04]Get his order immediately, son.
[192:32.98]That's a dangerous game you're playing right now.
[192:38.81]Feed him.
[192:40.45]You see that's exactly that's not a medium.
[192:43.97]That's a well done.
[192:45.29]I planned it.
[192:45.75]I don't like this.
[192:50.18]Yeah, you don't like a lot of things.
[192:59.39]I see these kick up a whole bunch of grease on the floor.
[193:09.34]Are you just trying to make one of each kind of thing to have just ready?
[193:12.75]I'm trying to make the ones that take longer first so that I can make a rare quicker.
[193:17.01]Like if they come and they want like a, you know, a well done and a rare.
[193:22.70]Or if I have a medium one, then it's, you know, it's easy to go plus one.
[193:29.02]Medium and rare.
[193:42.78]Enjoy.
[193:43.16]Sorry, I peed on the ground.
[193:46.69]Uhhhh, rare.
[194:15.64]I think that's it.
[194:18.02]We fucked up.
[194:18.70]-2.
[194:19.04]+2.
[194:19.52]-2.
[194:19.88]+2.
[194:20.12]We should not have immediately gone.
[194:21.96]We needed to put a blueprint in the research.
[194:24.28]We need to look for a research bumper to bump up the research.
[194:30.19]Shucks.
[194:30.73]We got to get that research going ASAP on one of those.
[194:33.63]That kitchen sink?
[194:35.33]Revolutionary.
[194:36.11]Upgradable plates.
[194:38.29]Sharp cutlery.
[194:41.02]Place on table to have customers eat faster.
[194:43.20]Ooh, that's actually pretty good.
[194:45.90]I'm upgrading the sink.
[194:47.02]We're going for it.
[194:48.90]You need a research table.
[194:50.76]Don't you?
[194:51.04]I think you need the research table to actually research it, but it looks like it's holding that in.
[194:55.84]It is.
[194:56.20]Oh, we got it by the desk.
[194:58.56]Huh?
[194:58.80]Research desk.
[195:00.00]Yeah, we don't have that one.
[195:01.17]Oh, yeah, we do.
[195:01.63]It's 40.
[195:01.81]I thought it was 60.
[195:07.22]Okay, when we open, you start researching.
[195:10.77]You ready?
[195:11.25]You got it.
[195:11.85]Let's go.
[195:22.22]Is that the room code?
[195:23.20]That is the seed for this game, I guess.
[195:26.58]I don't know why there's seeds.
[195:29.69]Rare.
[195:47.88]About to make some pumpkin pie.
[196:04.79]They really want us to make that pumpkin pie.
[196:06.67]Hopefully these guys want mediums.
[196:10.73]Rare and well, sorry.
[196:33.12]rare too easy dominated one shot one kill youtube are you playing Overwatch I have been a bit lately do you like it yeah is it fun like should I play it should you play it probably not okay
[197:03.92]I think you should try it probably when the PvE stuff comes out.
[197:06.92]That's what I'm waiting for.
[197:08.60]Is that coming at any point?
[197:12.70]Apparently they're piecemealing it.
[197:14.86]It might be another six months, sometime in July.
[197:17.70]Six months?
[197:18.86]Yeah.
[197:19.90]My goodness.
[197:20.80]It's basically like a year away.
[197:22.17]Six months might be generous.
[197:24.87]Wasn't that the whole selling point of the whole game?
[197:28.11]Yeah, it was.
[197:28.47]But they realized that was taking so long that they...
[197:32.21]said okay we'll do multiplayer stuff and not like hold that off because that's actually kind of sort of a little done interesting uh yeah we 20 slower sounds awful okay so we should have an upgraded thing over there um what kind of psycho wants chopped tomato on their steak like you go to a nice steak restaurant which is what we are we're incredible
[198:01.99]Mm-hmm.
[198:04.43]Like, just tomato slices?
[198:08.45]Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[198:10.81]Or is it, like, a tomato sauce?
[198:13.38]Tomato sauce would be kind of weird, too.
[198:15.78]Oh, we don't have the money for this.
[198:19.48]So we can upgrade it again.
[198:20.40]Do it again?
[198:21.20]Okay, I'll just start here.
[198:22.40]Um... Hold on, I did the Breaking Bad thing where I haven't, like, my eyes hurt, I haven't blinked in, like, three hours.
[198:32.83]Okay, right.
[198:34.63]Okay, we're good.
[198:41.96]Order up.
[198:46.12]This person wants probably the new thing I would imagine.
[198:50.53]Nope, just a well done.
[199:02.14]Oh yeah, I gotta keep that in mind that I might have to chop some tomatoes.
[199:05.80]Yeah.
[199:06.64]That's some dangerous cooking.
[199:13.16]These two want... I love that rain sound.
[199:20.05]They want a medium with tomato and well done.
[199:30.93]Mm-hmm.
[199:31.63]You already have a medium here, sir.
[199:33.11]I know.
[199:36.86]Oh, fuck.
[199:39.58]Fuck.
[199:43.50]I'm doing too many things.
[199:52.30]These two would like... I need more counter space.
[199:54.86]They need medium and rare.
[200:06.43]No.
[200:09.75]Don't give it to me.
[200:12.69]I'm waiting.
[200:15.25]You're burning.
[200:16.45]It's burning.
[200:17.25]You're burning it.
[200:18.05]I don't care.
[200:19.79]What?
[200:20.05]No.
[200:20.23]Give it to me.
[200:25.59]Oh, it's bad news.
[200:29.11]It's bad news.
[200:31.43]Wait, wait.
[200:32.09]You cooked it too much.
[200:34.01]You cooked it too much.
[200:36.41]This is ugly.
[200:37.19]It's getting ugly over here.
[200:42.64]Everything's fine.
[200:43.34]It's savable.
[200:44.20]We just need one rare.
[200:48.80]I'm overcomplicating.
[200:50.70]I'm trying to be maximum efficiency.
[200:58.21]You're okay.
[200:58.73]We're good.
[200:59.11]Everything's fine.
[200:59.55]I don't have to take that order yet.
[201:03.58]Yeah, this this grease ground we need like a mop as soon as we can get it.
[201:08.24]It is so hard to walk around and click on the right thing.
[201:17.29]OK, you good to take an order?
[201:19.31]Yeah.
[201:24.46]Rare rare one of them tomato.
[201:26.92]Yeah, I can't even get in the door.
[201:41.36]Why does my steak taste like soap?
[201:50.46]I need a mop.
[201:52.36]Yeah.
[201:53.42]And if you're ever, like, really waiting for me, I need a clean boy.
[201:59.79]I think I need to get on it earlier because you can clean the small ones quicker.
[202:02.71]Get a mop.
[202:05.73]Mop is better.
[202:06.19]I mean, if we get offered one.
[202:10.27]Gas...
[202:12.39]Eight more plates.
[202:15.17]Another counter.
[202:15.87]You wanted that, right?
[202:17.61]And a sink.
[202:18.49]You want the counter?
[202:20.61]Uh-oh.
[202:21.47]What?
[202:24.24]What's wrong?
[202:26.48]Hold on.
[202:27.24]This is a dishwasher.
[202:28.48]It's like a full dishwasher.
[202:30.14]I don't know if that's a problem.
[202:33.80]Is it?
[202:34.48]It's probably better.
[202:35.08]It does it automatically.
[202:38.34]No, that's phenomenal.
[202:39.26]That means it'll do it without us even touching it automatically.
[202:43.26]Okay.
[202:43.52]I was just thinking in the case of a kitchen where I actually need sink water, but I guess, you know, we still have a sink.
[202:48.06]Do you want the counter?
[202:49.10]Oh, we only have 15.
[202:49.87]They're yelling at us.
[202:54.59]They're saying upgrade more.
[202:57.07]Yeah, I'm upgrading something.
[202:57.91]Okay, how are you doing?
[203:00.99]You confident?
[203:02.57]Yeah, I'm upgrading a grill.
[203:03.67]Okay, I'll do the upgrade when we start.
[203:09.24]Is that where you want the dishwasher?
[203:11.98]Yeah, that's good because I actually yes.
[203:16.80]Maybe it's on the left side next day because it's kind of far.
[203:22.20]We're good.
[203:22.70]OK, taking it nice and slow cooking to order.
[203:25.32]Alright, here you are.
[203:31.99]Well with tomato medium tomato.
[203:49.86]I desperately need another counter.
[203:57.94]Now we need... Rare tomato, well tomato.
[204:10.64]See, when you do that, I can't place a tomato now.
[204:12.59]Yeah.
[204:17.37]Alright, now I need well tomato.
[204:25.87]And this guy, what do you want?
[204:29.13]Uh, medium tomato.
[204:29.83]No!
[204:50.31]Wait, these people might want well.
[204:52.01]Yeah, nope.
[204:53.50]Two mediums.
[204:53.90]So we need two mediums, one tomato, and one rare tomato.
[204:58.30]Two mediums, one tomato.
[204:59.28]Okay.
[205:04.85]Now I need a medium and a rare tomato.
[205:11.73]You need a plate.
[205:13.93]Alright, so I need a rare tomato.
[205:20.20]Yes, darling.
[205:20.78]Oh!
[205:21.52]Oh!
[205:35.40]Alright, this person wants a medium tomato and a well.
[205:41.86]What's that noise?
[205:45.72]Oh, it's a dishwasher.
[205:46.64]That's loud.
[205:48.36]This thing is amazing, by the way.
[205:51.08]This thing is absolutely just cracked out.
[205:53.17]I just need a well.
[205:57.93]I think that's it for the day.
[206:03.44]Alright, that was a little, that got a little heavy, but we're okay.
[206:05.84]I got a little sloppy.
[206:06.60]A little rough.
[206:07.68]Just one counter, dude.
[206:08.82]Just one counter.
[206:13.11]Put the plate rack next to the sink.
[206:17.07]It is.
[206:19.45]It is, though.
[206:28.25]Uh... Charming?
[206:31.63]Sure.
[206:31.87]We have never actually successfully set up decorations for one of these.
[206:34.94]No.
[206:39.36]Imagine going to a nice restaurant and the dishwasher is in the dining room.
[206:47.45]Oh, dartboard.
[206:48.15]We don't have enough money to do this, though.
[206:51.25]Yeah.
[206:57.91]A danger hob.
[207:02.36]double speed but catches fire after burning food I can keep that we can we can get the final upgrade on that ball light how do I move this I don't want to this isn't a really stupid place do these blueprints get re-rolled into useful stuff because like really it's counter space I don't know put the banner over the dishwasher I I gotta pick the banner up
[207:36.55]I don't think I can.
[207:37.25]I think it's just here forever.
[207:42.13]Ew.
[207:42.95]Yeah, that's annoying me.
[207:45.68]I'm actually very upset.
[207:46.82]It's pissing me off how the way this is and I can't pick it up.
[207:49.90]I hate it.
[207:55.28]I don't think I can move it.
[208:00.50]Oh, thank God.
[208:01.04]Okay.
[208:03.33]Here we go.
[208:04.59]Merry Christmas.

[208:53.05]What about it?
[208:53.79]What?
[208:54.05]I don't know what we're being yelled at.

[209:00.11]They're just yelling it.
[209:01.88]Plate rack.
[209:02.36]Swap with the sink.
[209:05.32]Swap the sink with the plate rack.
[209:07.97]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's because the dishwasher is over here, and I can just put the clean plates onto the dish.
[209:13.55]Okay, I get it.

[211:53.45]There's a plate stack here!
[211:54.47]You need more counters!
[211:55.81]That does not fix the idea that you need more counters!
[211:59.35]I do need more counters!
[212:02.30]We agree!
[212:03.84]Oops!
[212:07.54]Two wells, one with a tomato!

[212:22.00]You told me not to do that anymore.
[212:24.88]Yeah, but I set the plate there at that time on purpose.
[212:26.78]Hey, but you... What are you talking about?
[212:30.16]Okay, I didn't.
[212:30.64]Okay.
[212:31.12]You don't think I know what I'm doing over here?
[212:37.54]That's the 300th Boston accent this stream.
[212:41.95]Oh, dude, is this guy from the East Coast or something?
[212:43.73]I don't know.
[212:49.10]Um, bone in steak?
[212:51.22]Serve with the bone.
[212:53.44]Which must be thrown away after.
[212:54.80]Yeah, I gotta move.
[212:57.70]Table's gotta move.
[213:01.50]Bone in steak.
[213:04.34]Which I need to figure out, like, if I need to do something special for that.
[213:07.76]Yeah.
[213:10.94]Remove?
[213:11.40]I think I have to do that.
[213:13.82]I think I have to take the bone out.
[213:15.69]Remove bone before cleaning.
[213:18.45]So give me the trash because I have to do that here.
[213:23.13]Oh, no, I have to like.
[213:30.47]It's a whole separate cut of meat.
[213:32.55]We we need a counter gas limiter.
[213:40.06]No counter.
[213:41.20]Sorry, dude.
[213:42.83]okay well I'm gonna buy the extra hub and I can use that as a pretend counter take out the upgrade is the one in there yeah I got it oh you got it already okay let's upgrade the plate stack or maybe the gas limiter because this is super dependent what does the gas limiter do
[214:13.01]70 burn 75% slower, but 70.
[214:16.86]Wait, what is it?
[214:20.30]Burn slower, but cook slower.
[214:23.80]Oh, burning has not been a problem at all.
[214:25.96]I think the entire time we've been playing.
[214:33.62]How much money do we have?
[214:35.84]25 we can get these breadsticks.
[214:38.51]But I don't know how they work.
[214:40.07]They're kind of like a detriment, I think.
[214:44.90]We need to put the plates in the research.
[214:48.88]Yeah.
[214:55.55]Okay, I'm ready.
[214:57.91]You ready to go for bone-in?
[215:00.53]I'm ready to bone-in.
[215:01.49]Oopsie.
[215:02.45]You need to throw the bone away then.
[215:05.11]I need to throw them.
[215:05.83]Oh, the garbage.
[215:07.31]We didn't move it down here.
[215:09.45]That's GG.
[215:09.96]Fuck!
[215:10.78]That's GG.
[215:11.96]What does he want?
[215:12.68]I also got to wait for them now.
[215:16.02]In case they want bone in her steak.
[215:19.40]This is a rare tomato.
[215:22.12]Look at that.
[215:22.57]Look at that cook speed.
[215:23.39]Boom.
[215:27.09]Tomato.
[215:29.13]Just testing you.
[215:39.99]Medium tomato.
[215:46.04]That is so convenient.
[215:47.08]We don't even need all these burners now.
[215:49.26]Is it just way faster?
[215:50.84]Yeah.
[215:55.94]I need to move those plates.
[215:56.94]I like to have the middle open.
[216:00.37]They want... They want well and then rare tomato.
[216:13.75]Look at that.
[216:14.75]That's so much better.
[216:15.61]But you have to be on top of that, though.
[216:17.09]That can burn.
[216:17.51]That can, like, fuck it up so quickly.
[216:32.49]The bone is not very popular.
[216:34.31]They want a rare tomato.
[216:38.94]Well done.
[216:46.08]Put the plate down, please.
[216:48.26]Put the plate down, please, sir.
[216:50.76]Fuck!
[216:51.36]Fucking, I fucked it up.
[216:52.60]I fucked it up.
[216:53.14]I fucked it up.
[216:53.81]No, we're good.
[216:54.13]We're good.
[216:54.47]We're good.
[216:59.21]Great tomato.
[217:01.33]Thought it was the other way around.
[217:02.71]We're good.
[217:05.88]This person wants a bone-in tomato, and that looks like medium.
[217:10.68]Medium bone-in with tomato.
[217:21.46]There we go.
[217:22.08]Service up.
[217:23.04]I'll take this order.
[217:28.62]Good, good, good.
[217:30.65]Oh, trash.
[217:31.79]You got to throw that away.
[217:34.33]You can't go in here until it's thrown away.
[217:41.35]Yeah, that's awful.
[217:43.11]I need that over here.
[217:44.09]So hopefully we make it through this.
[217:45.25]It's so good that they didn't order a bunch of those.
[217:48.13]That would have been so awful.
[217:50.02]And then how do we take the trash out?
[217:51.42]Because the trash fills up.
[217:52.86]We need a well tomato.
[217:57.00]There's trash outside.
[217:57.90]I can do that.
[217:58.34]Alright, we're good.
[218:02.32]We made it.
[218:03.96]Yeah, I can't even dump a second one.
[218:05.72]Yeah, we just have to move that next time.
[218:07.76]We're good.
[218:10.44]Say bone and tomato.
[218:12.55]I don't like the way that rings.
[218:18.57]OK, cool.
[218:19.75]Alright, so priority number one.
[218:21.19]I need the trash in here.
[218:30.98]Auto plater.
[218:33.72]Conveyor.
[218:37.70]Oh, finally a counter.
[218:39.24]Didn't you want another one?
[218:41.33]I don't understand this one.
[218:42.31]It says automatically plates anything placed in front of it.
[218:47.55]I don't know.
[218:54.75]Can I pick the trash up?
[218:56.49]No.
[219:07.66]Okay.
[219:08.10]That solves literally every problem.
[219:12.21]We did upgrade the plates.
[219:14.97]They need to upgrade again.
[219:15.97]Again?
[219:16.27]I was looking at it.
[219:17.51]Let them cook a little longer.
[219:18.71]Um...
[219:23.09]I mean, I think we're good if you got the trash out there.
[219:26.69]Oh, wait, that's another counter.
[219:27.75]We're taking a countertop.
[219:28.99]Countertop.
[219:29.73]Countertop.
[219:41.04]I think I'm going to put this up.
[219:42.50]Yeah, like right there.
[219:45.12]Okay.
[219:47.62]Do I need to upgrade this, right?
[219:49.81]Yep.
[219:50.89]Let's go.
[219:52.53]Uh, nope.
[219:54.33]Wait, what?
[219:55.19]It cannot.
[219:55.65]OK, then I don't really understand what it does.
[220:00.99]I think some things can only be upgraded once.
[220:03.25]Well, I mean, I don't understand what the autoplayer does in general.
[220:07.43]Oh.
[220:09.89]Alright, rare tomato.
[220:22.46]Upgrade this.
[220:27.73]I think this this grill also doesn't make grease all over the ground.
[220:31.74]Medium.
[220:35.46]Things got infinitely easier.
[220:36.82]I could see where that would be hard to use, though, because it just happens so quickly.
[220:51.23]We got.
[220:56.08]Rare bone-in, rare.
[220:58.24]Rare bone-in tomato, rare.
[221:03.09]It needs the tomato.
[221:04.31]No, no, no.
[221:04.71]Rare bone-in tomato, rare.
[221:08.03]Oh, boy.
[221:14.09]We're good.
[221:17.47]My old age is kicking in.
[221:20.58]That's a well done bone-in.
[221:28.94]Well done.
[221:29.38]Is that?
[221:30.08]No, well.
[221:33.88]Well done.
[221:34.16]Sure?
[221:34.58]Yeah, one more.
[221:38.42]Okay.
[221:45.39]And... I was going to wait, but yeah, go ahead.
[221:53.59]Now we need... Well, well, tomato, tomato.
[221:56.49]Well, tomato, well, tomato.
[222:02.98]I gotta put this shit down!
[222:04.02]Okay, got two plates for you.
[222:15.29]Oh, we were born for this!
[222:16.75]Okay, let me get this other order.
[222:21.26]We are looking for a bone-in, rare bone-in well.
[222:39.71]You gotta cook that more.
[222:42.87]That's... One of them's rare?
[222:44.35]Yeah, one of them's rare.
[222:45.35]Bone-in rare, bone-in well.
[222:48.45]I... That's... Oh, my fucking... The trash is all the way out here.
[222:54.02]I'm doomed.
[222:54.76]I need help.
[222:55.26]Oh, just pass it, pass it.
[222:55.94]I gotta get... Right here.
[222:57.22]The trash is full.
[222:57.94]Trash is full.
[222:58.68]Trash is full.
[222:59.24]Oh, shoot!
[223:00.52]It's okay.
[223:00.82]It's okay.
[223:01.18]It's okay.
[223:01.52]It's okay.
[223:01.72]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[223:04.99]Rare.
[223:05.11]Rare.
[223:12.07]We're good.
[223:13.19]We're good.
[223:13.97]That was, uh... That was scary.
[223:17.34]Okay.
[223:18.46]Incoming.
[223:19.14]Oink.
[223:21.04]Incoming.
[223:21.76]This shit's full again!
[223:24.78]The trash is fucking full!
[223:26.52]Yeah, it fills after one.
[223:27.62]I think it's two.
[223:31.29]I don't know about that there, bucko.
[223:33.33]Alright, these guys... Alright, we need, uh... Bone in, bone in.
[223:37.23]Bone in... Bone in rare with tomato, bone in well.
[223:48.16]Man, if my guy could just learn how to take this thing off of a plate.
[223:53.38]That's too much.
[223:54.16]You sure?
[223:56.28]That's not rare.
[223:57.48]This is well.
[223:58.40]Oh, no, no, no.
[223:58.78]You're good.
[223:59.06]You're good.
[223:59.46]Sorry.
[223:59.60]I thought I was looking at myself.
[224:00.36]Alright.
[224:00.56]We have rare needs to train.
[224:03.06]The color of those is weird.
[224:07.09]We're good.
[224:07.43]We did it.
[224:07.73]Okay.
[224:11.51]Can you upgrade the trash?
[224:15.43]I don't think there's a trash blueprint.
[224:19.28]This is the furthest we've ever been.
[224:20.72]I think you should put the trash near the door so you can take it out easier.
[224:23.72]Yeah, it's gonna do.
[224:32.21]It's like right next to the door.
[224:33.97]What if I tomato?
[224:38.30]Why would you want two tomato things?
[224:41.26]I don't know.
[224:41.62]Maybe you can upgrade it.
[224:44.55]yeah looks like you can eat who knows if you can actually oh meat more meat man oh they don't like that okay they don't want to sit next like the smelly trash okay alright we're good should I do yeah this I what I need an explanation what this auto plater does because you like auto plates what if I put something on it's already going on the plate
[225:14.62]Um, let's see if anybody in chat tells us.
[225:17.34]What, on Twitch integration?
[225:19.38]It's not happening right now, not tonight.
[225:22.24]You're gonna, like, open up a page, log in, like, link, do a link, activate it, go.
[225:28.23]Oh, I get it.
[225:32.63]It's for, like, if you had the conveyor belt, then it would, like, you'd conveyor belt a plate down in front of the autoplater.
[225:41.97]But we don't have conveyor belts.
[225:47.53]Oh, we have $100.
[225:48.91]There's nothing else here we need.
[225:50.41]Not really.
[225:50.83]We could upgrade something.
[225:51.53]Wait, is that a counter?
[225:52.25]That is a counter here, darling.
[225:56.73]We could re-roll.
[225:57.45]I'm going to upgrade this counter.
[226:00.40]You don't want to re-roll?
[226:03.42]No, I just want to... Wait, hold on.
[226:06.40]Let me make the counter.
[226:07.46]That's my shirt?
[226:08.54]This is an Andy Mark shirt.
[226:11.34]Do it.
[226:12.95]We need a mop.
[226:14.43]A mop would be nice still.
[226:16.39]That's what I'm saying.
[226:16.89]We should just re-roll.
[226:18.07]Re-roll.
[226:18.77]You're out there.
[226:19.33]Let's re-roll.
[226:24.48]Scrubbing brush.
[226:27.54]Wipe the floor.
[226:28.28]Scrub the dishes.
[226:29.00]Don't think too much.
[226:29.90]So hold this to do floor... Oh, two times faster on floor messes.
[226:34.40]And scrub is three times faster on something.
[226:37.52]Wellies.
[226:43.16]get it I think this makes a huge mess but you don't care about the mess anymore and then another dish rack I think we're ready what about the dish I think yes um no let's go we are wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[227:05.90]maybe the dish rack we're we're like we're limited we can clean plates quickly but we have a stack of four for this whole fucking place alright let's get it here I'll pass it to you the wall no I won't well what what is that why does it look so different wait there's no dishes it's a dish rack
[227:38.13]Oh, so you can put dishes in the dish rack.
[227:40.59]But who cares?
[227:42.17]Wait, no.
[227:44.35]Wait, you go away.
[227:46.16]Wait, what is it?
[227:47.86]Yeah, who cares?
[227:48.50]It's for dirty plates, but... I don't get it.
[227:55.10]Alright.
[227:55.40]Well, like that here, we'll just put that in the... We have so much money.
[227:59.40]We're so wealthy.
[228:00.28]We're so well off.
[228:02.18]But what... It doesn't even matter.
[228:03.53]It's for dirty plates.
[228:04.47]Yeah, but...
[228:06.83]What does that do?
[228:07.51]Does it... We don't have... Oh, whatever.
[228:13.13]Yeah, I guess if the dishwasher is currently running... Then I could put some in there.
[228:17.67]Yeah.
[228:18.17]Okay.
[228:18.57]Whatever.
[228:21.47]You want the wellies?
[228:23.58]What do they do?
[228:25.14]You make a huge mess, but your character does not care.
[228:27.66]You never step... Oh, yes.
[228:29.44]You should put those on up there.
[228:30.78]Yes.
[228:33.80]Put them in here, just the same space, and I'll put them on.
[228:36.75]Why are you putting them over there?
[228:38.77]No, what are you doing in my wellies?
[228:40.79]Stop.
[228:40.95]Okay, let's go.
[228:46.91]Can't upgrade.
[228:47.55]You better +2 that.
[228:50.33]+2.
[228:52.28]Okay, here we go.
[228:54.05]Oh, they're so hungry, they're conjoined into one person.
[228:56.13]I thought it was one person.
[228:57.91]Somebody said, I hate you both.
[228:59.80]No, you don't.
[229:00.68]Alright, we need two double well bone-ins.
[229:05.34]We have four plates.
[229:06.44]I think this is it.
[229:08.28]We have four plates.
[229:20.13]Yeah, I don't like... It's not done.
[229:25.80]oh my god oh my oh my I'm like I'm like colorblind to them I thought that was it the bone ends are a little they look a little finicky no like like like phase one is the same color as phase three fucking fucking hell man hey we got uh new stuff
[229:59.02]There's a colorblind mode.
[230:00.22]It puts a letter next to the meat.
[230:02.24]Really?
[230:02.52]I would not have made any mistakes at all.
[230:06.96]Ever.
[230:08.08]Ever in my life.
[230:09.98]Does it?
[230:12.71]Letters inside?
[230:14.43]Where is it?
[230:15.41]Oh, accessibility.
[230:18.09]Ooh.
[230:20.49]That's big.
[230:21.43]That's actually a huge deal.
[230:24.47]Let me cook these pizzas.
[230:25.87]Let's get a pizza run.
[230:26.59]You want to do a pizza run?
[230:30.35]A medium floor plan with a pizza would be huge.
[230:33.41]I don't really care about the floor plan.
[230:41.30]Do a taco truck.
[230:41.86]I'm just the pizza god.
[230:44.72]We need to get to day 15, first of all.
[230:46.93]Because I don't think we need to first beat this.
[230:50.55]Place the garage items in the loading bay.
[230:52.87]Oh, we did get garage items.
[230:55.01]Where are they?
[230:58.25]Are those the garage items?
[230:59.25]I was wondering about that.
[231:00.23]Like, nothing is really explained.
[231:04.65]Oh, we get to start with a wash basin.
[231:08.56]We get to start with this stuff.
[231:11.56]Whatever we put, whatever two things we bring in here.
[231:20.28]Playing on fucking hard mode.
[231:24.22]Well, that's candles for patients.
[231:27.82]Uh,
[231:28.62]Yeah, we restart from the beginning.
[231:29.86]It's cooking roguelike.
[231:32.70]Extra life.
[231:36.42]We're going the whole way.
[231:39.36]Oh, that's actually a pretty big deal.
[231:45.67]That's actually really helpful.
[231:47.19]I'm good to go.
[231:47.73]Okay.
[231:49.39]Wait, you're doing a small one?
[231:52.13]I can't tell which one's big.
[231:53.45]I think the long one here is... Wait, do we even have a medium?
[231:57.53]Medium?
[232:01.21]Can you only do pizza on small?
[232:05.55]Or is it random?
[232:06.47]These are the three we were offered.
[232:07.63]I think there's like a whole bunch of them.
[232:09.23]It's probably random.
[232:11.11]No, just pick the one you like.
[232:13.85]If it says plus upgradable on the blueprint, see if it says it.
[232:17.96]It does.
[232:19.50]Not on this one, but yeah.
[232:25.94]Well, we also have upgrade kits.
[232:30.71]Should we replace the extra life?
[232:33.34]I think that would make us start with a dishwasher.
[232:36.10]Upgrade at the top.
[232:37.50]Wait, hold on.
[232:44.91]Once you level up, you can do any seed, but for now, it's mid ones.
[232:48.97]Oh, okay.
[232:54.40]Okay.
[232:57.67]Upgrade the sink.
[232:59.77]Wait, so... How do we... I mean, like... Wait a minute.
[233:04.43]I didn't even realize you could walk through there.
[233:06.07]What the hell is this?
[233:08.73]Oh.
[233:11.57]Okay.
[233:12.25]Wait.
[233:12.85]What did that do?
[233:16.03]Dishwasher.
[233:16.59]Oh, we start... Dude, it starts with the dishwasher.
[233:19.05]Okay.
[233:21.49]What happened to the other thing?
[233:25.35]It used it.
[233:25.99]It consumed it.
[233:28.78]We can do it again.
[233:34.43]With an upgrade kit.
[233:35.39]You want it again?
[233:37.61]What is better than a dishwasher?
[233:38.93]I don't know.
[233:40.37]What is it?
[233:41.75]Dude, it's an assault rifle!
[233:43.35]Soaking... Washes dishes but cannot provide water for recipes.
[233:49.41]So it's just like a super sink?
[233:55.01]I am about to make every pizza...
[233:59.88]I actually could.
[234:00.54]I could.
[234:00.92]What time is it?
[234:01.44]I want to order a pizza.
[234:02.44]Somebody said that thing sucks.
[234:04.80]Oh, OK, good.
[234:05.84]You're going to get a pizza.
[234:11.02]No, it's too late.
[234:17.26]Wait, this is throwing it away.
[234:18.40]OK, that extra life has to be inside.
[234:29.06]So soaking sink?
[234:33.62]Does this thing suck?
[234:36.31]How is this better than dishwasher?
[234:37.41]I don't know.
[234:40.85]We'll find out.
[234:41.55]Do this.
[234:42.01]IRL.
[234:42.49]Alright.
[234:46.87]He did it.
[234:47.23]That's kind of fun.
[234:55.81]Um...
[235:13.52]I'll get this turned back up.
[235:14.44]I'll keep it where it was.
[235:23.15]Should you have this sink over there or should I have it over here?
[235:25.39]I feel like it's going to be a mess.
[235:28.60]It's not a dishwasher.
[235:29.46]It's just soaking sink.
[235:31.66]uh let's do what we did in the other one and put it like in the middle there so that we can all just dump dishes into that yeah can you put the yeah no that'd be hard okay no if you put the dish rack like over here so I can um put clean dishes oh no actually you can just take them out can't you the booking desk is free yeah but doesn't it make it harder
[235:58.70]I think it would help early on because then you can make more money if you can just like serve more people in a day yeah let's just put it up here okay here we go pizza what is happening uh I don't know oh my hand was
[236:26.87]Oh, that's in a bad spot.
[236:28.63]Cheese pizza.
[236:30.79]Really?
[236:31.11]Yep.
[236:35.36]Forgot how to make it.
[236:36.20]That's day one.
[236:38.30]They don't fucking care.
[236:39.50]He's never coming back.
[236:45.71]Oh, yeah.
[236:47.23]More than one person.
[237:00.27]Our kitchen needs a little work.
[237:03.40]It does.
[237:03.70]Are you dizzy?
[237:05.70]No, I'm good.
[237:09.18]Oh, hold on.
[237:12.36]You can just stand there with that food and you can wait.
[237:20.61]How many plates can go in the sink?
[237:24.76]ain't just one right it should be at least four it's funny I like this one it's one it's oh I see this is awful
[237:42.26]it's one that okay the dishwasher can have up to four why can this only have one that was underwater by the way the tier two one can have uh four in it when you wash them all at once but you have to do it manually it's just faster yeah but I would rather have the convenience of putting more than one in
[238:10.59]Because otherwise it just piles up.
[238:17.95]Yeah, this thing kind of sucks.
[238:26.21]Upgradable.
[238:29.61]We need another sink.
[238:31.13]Let's upgrade the sink because our sink sucks.
[238:33.39]Our fully upgraded super sink.
[238:34.95]Okay, we need a desk then.
[238:57.56]um oh we're missing one dollar for the research desk and the research desk itself is upgradable weird interesting interesting
[239:25.15]Put the research desk in the drawer instead.
[239:28.43]I wonder what the... But how would this... We need a research desk to research the research desk upgrade.
[239:39.61]We sure do.
[239:45.87]Yeah, but you save it.
[239:50.07]We already have... I mean, I don't know.
[239:51.95]I think we're kind of screwed.
[239:53.41]Put the sink in there to save it.
[239:57.03]There's something in there already.
[239:58.47]How do you take it out?
[240:01.19]Uh, X?
[240:02.65]A?
[240:06.67]Okay.
[240:07.92]Okay.
[240:08.98]Alright, let's try it.
[240:10.38]I can't believe we're going all 30 days.
[240:12.56]Good luck.
[240:14.24]Good luck.
[240:28.26]I bet you they want a cheese pizza.
[240:32.27]Better not.
[240:37.37]Yeah, they do.
[240:38.19]Put it in the sink.
[240:48.92]I feel like you should move one of those counters over here.
[240:50.76]Yeah, I agree.
[241:09.43]Do you guys want pizza?
[241:10.67]Yes, you do.
[241:14.31]Welcome to the restaurant.
[241:15.23]We can only make cheese pizzas.
[241:18.93]This pizza is good.
[241:20.17]You know what you're doing.
[241:21.00]If you have a recipe and it's really great, you don't need to do anything else.
[241:25.12]Cheese pizza.
[241:30.78]This guy wanted cheese pizza.
[241:35.38]Uh, maybe.
[241:44.58]I'm just going to pre-serve every table.
[241:46.32]You don't have pepperoni?
[241:55.63]We have nothing.
[241:57.07]We only have cheese and pizza.
[241:58.87]Do you like pepperoni?
[241:59.51]I don't think I even asked you that.
[242:01.15]I love pepperoni.
[242:03.21]Are you a big circle pepperoni soft kind of guy or are you a small little tiny circle?
[242:10.54]Small crispy because they get crispy on the edges better.
[242:13.14]Okay.
[242:14.58]I'm noticing you like crispy things.
[242:16.24]I do, but here's the one problem with that, though.
[242:17.86]I do like it, but sometimes the pepperoni, all the edges curl up, and you get these pools of kind of oil in the middle of all the little ones.
[242:28.73]It can... I'm not a huge fan of that.
[242:32.41]But if I'm in the mood for that, maybe.
[242:35.27]There's this place around here, they have really small pepperonis.
[242:38.00]I've only ordered it from here like once.
[242:40.66]small pepperonis and they curl up into like pods like craters on the moon for all of the gross pizza juice to just like like miniature lakes that's exactly what I just said yeah I didn't like it you don't like that I did not like that I felt like I was like IV dripping like pizza grease into my vein yeah that's what I mean the small ones have a tendency to do that that's
[243:06.74]that's okay well I guess I'm in like a medium like normal pepperoni because I know there's like the New York pizzas have those gigantic like super peps I like just a standard a standard pepperoni that's that's where we're at yeah hey come on there it is thank you right here man yo that's what I'm talking about you want to get that extra dining table or up let's upgrade wait I feel like that's what was our sink situation oh we don't actually have the research
[243:34.26]No, we need a table.
[243:35.85]Let's get that table.
[243:36.89]Buy that table.
[243:38.97]Didn't we have one?
[243:39.81]What happened to it?
[243:40.95]We couldn't afford it.
[243:43.43]Oh, shit.
[243:44.09]We didn't.
[243:45.15]Why do we keep the sink in here?
[243:47.29]Because we get to keep the upgrade across.
[243:50.83]Like, you still have to buy the sink.
[243:52.25]We want a better sink.
[243:53.89]But this is the best sink.
[243:55.43]We have to live with it.
[243:56.19]That sink is not the best sink.
[243:58.59]Okay.
[243:59.37]You're right.
[244:01.35]Just re-roll.
[244:02.01]We only have $30.
[244:06.42]Alright, I forgot I named the restaurant that and I was... I got taken aback for a second.
[244:11.79]I haven't... I just... I didn't even notice that.
[244:24.05]What are you going to order?
[244:26.28]Let him do it.
[244:26.82]Let him order.
[244:28.02]Let him order.
[244:28.38]How about... Oh, he wants one single water.
[244:30.76]Yeah, I could just have a water.
[244:35.28]okay and yeah you're good I cannot cut the pizza I cannot reach it from here I know I'm thinking wouldn't it be funny if like we had his pizza ready and we could give it to him right now but we like made him wait good and you're like sitting there at your table and you're wondering like where's my food
[244:57.58]I can see that there's a pizza back there.
[244:59.85]I'm telling you right now, I do not like this whole setup.
[245:04.88]I hate it.
[245:05.20]I absolutely hate it.
[245:06.48]This is ending at day like six.
[245:26.43]space is so important and we just don't have any especially with all the plates but we will make it what are we going to do about it complain over and over again until we decide to stop playing I was looking for like a practical how do we arrange this
[245:55.52]The sink is the problem.
[245:58.74]Mm-hmm.
[246:00.58]Chips.
[246:01.96]Messes are created in a... Oh, that's awful.
[246:06.30]Let's go.
[246:06.56]Quick to make, but... Okay, so you have to make these.
[246:09.24]I'm the chef.
[246:10.40]Pizza and chips.
[246:14.76]Chopped potatoes and... Oh, you have to actually cook them.
[246:16.72]You can just empty, like, a bag of lays or something into, like, a... Like a bowl?
[246:22.15]What am I cooking them in?
[246:23.35]Hey, here we go.
[246:23.81]Research desk.
[246:24.23]In the pizza oven?
[246:26.62]research desk alright the sink is in here right now yeah what is it like chips like oh chips or is it like potato chips potato chips so it's potato chips not chips like fries not not chocolate chips
[246:50.63]It's crisps.
[246:51.39]Is it crisps or chips?
[246:53.43]It is fries.
[246:53.81]I don't know, man.
[246:54.37]I think this is an English game.
[246:55.97]Yeah, so am I putting it in the oven?
[246:57.56]I'm just taking potatoes and putting them in the oven.
[247:00.82]I'm chopping potatoes and ovening them.
[247:03.04]I guess.
[247:04.30]Okay, then I am... I'm ready.
[247:07.64]I'm going to do the research.
[247:11.62]We want the sink in there, right?
[247:14.96]Yeah.
[247:21.31]I like that word, crisps.
[247:23.79]Crisps.
[247:28.11]He wants pizza and crisps.
[247:36.10]Bet he does.
[247:36.66]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[247:52.94]don't hope you don't want chips oh he does uh it's a baked potato sorry we forgot to cut your fries and we baked the whole potato here you go
[248:23.48]uh we want one cheese one cheese and fries I'm not stop saying it one cheese and are you me I didn't do that yeah why can't you just pick it up and put it on the other plate nope uh we want just two cheese nothing else
[248:54.42]I gotta make a whole other pizza, so this is, uh... I think you got time.
[248:59.43]This is looking a little dicey.
[249:01.11]No, you're good.
[249:02.09]Stay waiting.
[249:04.23]Didn't we pick, like, comfy?
[249:05.95]They don't care?
[249:07.99]Ah!
[249:10.44]Dude, that just scared the fucking shit out of me.
[249:12.58]It scared me, too!
[249:13.94]What happened?
[249:14.52]I don't understand.
[249:15.36]I don't get it.
[249:16.04]I went to go put the fully prepared pizza in the oven and put it into the trash that was right next to the oven.
[249:21.04]What?
[249:21.86]I didn't even see it.
[249:25.47]So now we're fucked.
[249:26.77]Now we are fucked.
[249:28.82]It instantly just like boom gone.
[249:32.99]You just threw a whole piece into the trash.
[249:43.69]Oh, my God.
[249:44.53]I think I peaked my mic, which is hard to do.
[249:48.29]It sounded okay.
[249:50.22]Okay.
[249:51.00]That really... I'm moving that garbage.
[249:53.56]This whole kitchen, I don't like it.
[249:56.52]This is... I mean, it sounded like... We got a customer, dude.
[249:58.58]It sounded like a bat flew in your room.
[250:03.58]It swooped down and tried to bite you on the neck.
[250:08.64]Oh, you got it.
[250:09.92]Compliments from the chef.
[250:17.56]Here, can we, like, next guy who comes in, we give him the trash bag?
[250:24.88]I saw this meme video, like, this TikTok video one time.
[250:27.64]This lady, she was at a restaurant back in the kitchen.
[250:32.64]She was balancing, for some reason, she was trying to hold five different bowl dinners, and she was balancing them on a trash can.
[250:41.89]And she moved a little too much, and five full plates of dinner just went right into the trash.
[250:49.58]It's so awful.
[250:50.80]It's such a sad video.
[250:53.02]Every single one goes in the trash.
[250:56.00]And she just goes... Oh, I feel it.
[250:59.40]It feels so awful.
[251:04.62]I'm gonna upgrade that sink again.
[251:09.50]Power?
[251:09.94]What is it?
[251:10.23]Wait.
[251:10.55]Power sink.
[251:13.80]Double speed but cannot provide water.
[251:15.96]Power jet?
[251:17.90]Should we put it in there again?
[251:19.80]Yeah.
[251:20.58]Let that thing cook.
[251:21.92]Will it turn into a dishwasher eventually?
[251:23.74]I think the next one is the dishwasher.
[251:27.62]Did you get the work boots?
[251:29.50]I didn't.
[251:30.78]I might want to buy the plates.
[251:31.81]I am buying the plates.
[251:40.73]I want to see this clip.
[251:41.51]Pizza eviscerated.
[251:42.65]Let me see it.
[251:44.80]I didn't even see you do it.
[251:47.10]It was such a clean like step one, step two, step two, step five.
[251:50.32]Ready to put it.
[251:50.80]Boom.
[251:51.64]Let's see.
[251:52.40]I think you got time.
[251:53.78]This is looking a little dicey.
[251:55.49]No, you're good.
[251:56.47]Stay waiting.
[251:58.47]We picked.
[251:58.87]Didn't we pick like comfy?
[252:00.33]They don't care.
[252:09.97]uh okay I was gonna say yeah definitely move the trash yeah put the trash out out with you alright so you guys can relate I am ready ready come on got it
[252:40.35]uh they want pizza I don't know why it's funny but I like the way you said it it sounded like disappointed oh they're pizza can't they just order something else just can't order anything else burger or something pizza pizza only pizza ever
[253:19.30]Another day another pizza.
[253:25.01]Pizza can't reach that one.
[253:35.21]It's common.
[253:45.05]Can you please tell them our company slogan?
[253:47.57]I said, can you think you could use your influence to get Costco to bring back the pizza combo?
[253:53.93]Can you talk?
[253:54.47]Can you take the order?
[253:55.35]Oh, you don't even have to.
[253:58.41]You don't even have to wash that.
[254:01.91]We need one cheese, one cheese and fry.
[254:06.95]Is it influence?
[254:09.90]Order up.
[254:11.63]The influence that I would have on a company, like Costco, is the equivalent of me, like, showing up with, like, three people.
[254:22.27]And we're all in, like, clown outfits.
[254:24.62]It's, I don't, not very much.
[254:27.08]You're just ignoring customers.
[254:29.83]I'm doing a funny little bit, man.
[254:31.55]You're like on your phone.
[254:32.88]There's a customer right next to you and he like knows you can serve him and he's just like side-eyeing you and you're like, oh, hey, I'm doing a funny, I'm watching like a TikTok.
[254:39.60]I mean, we would get the attention, right?
[254:41.36]Like if three people in clown costumes had a meeting with the Costco representatives, it would be like, oh, we would get there.
[254:47.51]It would be like attention grabbing, but they'd be like, okay, now get the fuck out of here, you clown.
[255:01.12]Take their order already.
[255:02.10]Take their order.
[255:03.37]Guys, they're ordering pizza.
[255:05.01]He knows what to make.
[255:07.03]What am I doing?
[255:10.25]There's too many plates in that rack.
[255:17.93]Looks like we got three left over if you want to share a bite of my pie.
[255:24.47]Again, you're back there and you're just being a weird guy.
[255:27.87]I'll be a weird guy no matter where I am.
[255:30.21]Alright, affordable or charming?
[255:32.73]Again, we have never done one of these.
[255:37.68]So what?
[255:38.18]OK, affordable.
[255:39.54]Focus to serve as quickly as possible.
[255:42.62]So eventually they have decreased eating time.
[255:47.30]Halves the time, but no.
[255:48.76]What did you pick?
[255:50.72]You picked the right one.
[255:51.46]You were already on the right.
[255:52.48]Oh, I was reading.
[255:54.38]Oh, sure you were.
[255:57.30]Water basin, water basin.
[256:00.84]You want the water basement, you want to wait again for the washer.
[256:03.30]I like the water basin.
[256:04.72]The water basin, I think, is immediate.
[256:07.22]But what do we do with the super sink?
[256:11.52]It's like in here in case like something.
[256:14.94]No.
[256:18.27]The trash is causing customers to be upset, I think.
[256:21.23]Yeah, it can't be up here, is it?
[256:23.29]Yep.
[256:23.69]See, they look at the stinky fish thing.
[256:26.99]Oh, we lose money, dog.
[256:30.73]Okay.
[256:32.11]So it's got to have to be somewhere up here.
[256:34.23]Yeah, put in... I'm ready.
[256:39.33]You ready?
[256:41.33]So this is the one we want.
[256:43.67]What about a plant?
[256:45.23]Oh, that's expensive.
[256:46.28]Expensive plant.
[256:48.76]I'm going to sneeze.
[256:55.28]Fine.
[256:56.18]I hate that more than anything.
[256:57.74]I thought about it too much.
[256:59.36]Oh, the angry.
[257:03.83]I hate that more than anything you can use a barrel as a counter when we need money he spent it all can you I think so that's awesome then because it counts as a decoration alright okay let's go we got no money we're poor we're good
[257:31.82]Start making the dough.
[257:32.92]Come on.
[257:33.80]It's 8 a.m.
[257:35.36]Okay, I am doing it.
[257:36.72]I am doing it.
[257:37.48]I am doing it.
[257:38.84]I'm sorry, boss.
[257:39.84]Hey, can you guys wrap it up?
[257:40.78]It's my bedtime soon.
[257:41.76]Okay, I'm just going to throw this pizza in the trash.
[258:02.79]You can't put them in there anymore.
[258:03.75]Wait, we can't put them in there.
[258:05.29]Uh-oh.
[258:09.02]Oh, this is bad.
[258:11.74]We need to pivot here.
[258:13.34]Okay, where are... No, you can't have that.
[258:17.08]That's not yours.
[258:34.65]Hey, can we have someone handle that customer on the way on the left?
[258:37.05]Someone handle that guy?
[258:38.05]Do you see?
[258:38.71]I am working, okay?
[258:43.04]I just hate to see a customer neglect it.
[258:45.96]At the fuck you customer leave pizzeria.
[259:01.41]Fuck you customer leave.
[259:04.88]What a nice place.
[259:10.70]Need a slice.
[259:11.70]I can't reach it.
[259:12.23]Need a slice on here.
[259:37.65]I need a fry.
[259:38.81]I blew it.
[259:39.47]It's over.
[259:39.77]I fucked everything up.
[259:41.73]It's over.
[259:44.15]It might not be.
[259:44.63]Put it on there.
[259:45.69]Give it to me.
[259:46.07]Give it to me.
[259:46.55]Give it to me.
[259:47.07]Give it to me.
[259:47.41]Give it to me.
[259:50.65]Thanks for coming.
[259:51.87]Make sure to give us a nice review on Google.
[259:57.27]There's pizza.
[259:59.91]Yeah, this center... This sucks.
[260:08.35]We're still fine.
[260:13.23]Man.
[260:14.93]It's a good thing I have cat-like reflexes.
[260:16.63]Thanks for the applause.
[260:22.13]Somebody said, guys, move everything to the left, please.
[260:26.33]Nope.
[260:27.86]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[260:29.90]+2 maximum group size.
[260:34.01]Let's do that.
[260:34.77]That's kind of interesting.
[260:36.15]Plus 200.
[260:36.43]It's better reward too.
[260:37.45]And I think that's actually easier.
[260:39.67]So.
[260:40.23]Not that I know what experience.
[260:41.41]Well, when you make a big pizza, because we're doing pizza.
[260:44.37]So that's actually huge.
[260:46.10]And no weird.
[260:46.72]I'm making the same amount of pizzas.
[260:48.28]Unless like four dudes want fries, then I'm like, then we're fucked.
[260:51.96]Yeah.
[260:53.06]But I mean, you make one whole pizza.
[260:54.30]That's a whole table.
[260:55.36]How many slices is it?
[260:56.40]Four?
[260:56.92]Five?
[260:57.62]Four.
[260:59.15]Four.
[260:59.83]It's been four.
[261:00.67]Provides oil.
[261:03.65]oil you could oil me up I left the call okay I wonder what the oil does
[261:35.18]and that makes sense that it's one for a plate and one for washing yes I think everything you just said for the last few minutes I completely agree with great that's all that I asked it's all that I asked are we good wait what about an upgrade
[262:03.27]Upgrade.
[262:03.95]Floor buffer?
[262:05.02]Upgrade.
[262:05.60]Increases movement and prevents spills.
[262:07.52]We can upgrade this.
[262:08.92]Upgrade that.
[262:09.80]I wonder what that does.
[262:10.43]Okay, let's go.
[262:22.57]gotta be top of my game here yeah you there's three people okay what do they want we're looking at uh pizza pizza pizza fry pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza fry pizza pizza pizza fry you can do it it's this plating nightmare it is a nightmare I actually like how do we get three pizzas out at once right with this um

[265:43.33]Okay.
[265:43.47]Alright, what do you got?
[265:45.59]What was the thing we upgraded?
[265:46.97]What is in here?
[265:49.75]Robot floor cleaner.
[265:50.91]250?
[265:51.53]That's way too much.
[265:53.89]I'm going to put a dining table.
[265:56.50]Someone help me with my homework?
[265:57.94]Yeah, okay.
[265:58.34]We're going to go through 1 through 20.
[266:00.54]A, B, C, A, B, B, C, A, D, D, A, B, C, D, B, A, B. Got it.
[266:14.69]thanks dude I got a zero um I think we should re-roll try and get decorations a mixer thanks dude I failed no do your homework what time is it go do your homework
[266:43.77]This this item placed on a table to reset their order.
[266:48.71]Like you just distract them with the specials menu.
[266:53.07]Oh, so they we can actually use buys time.
[266:57.35]That's actually kind of good.
[266:59.68]What about the work boots?
[267:01.94]You don't care if it's a mess up here.
[267:05.44]Not really.
[267:06.10]I mean, I really just want to get the patience increase.
[267:10.12]You want to do the menu?
[267:14.24]I mean, you're the one out there if you want to use it.
[267:18.11]What we need to do right now is solve this plating situation.
[267:22.19]Yes, we do.
[267:22.83]Okay, so the problem is there's not enough space here.
[267:25.53]I mean, now that there's eight plates, it actually might be okay.
[267:31.93]We can reroll again.
[267:34.28]Take that and you can put a plate on there.
[267:36.18]So you can take one from the table and then move it over.
[267:38.26]You see what I mean?
[267:39.60]Okay, yep.
[267:40.68]I have access to three spots.
[267:42.40]I think that helps a lot.
[267:44.45]The mixer is goaded.
[267:45.43]We don't have anything to mix.
[267:50.93]Well, you can chop and use your hand.
[267:56.76]What?
[267:57.20]I don't know.
[267:57.92]I don't know what I meant.
[268:04.14]I'm ready to start though.
[268:05.62]I guess we're ready.
[268:10.53]Reroll again.
[268:11.07]It's 20 bucks.
[268:14.05]Get ready to upgrade the table.
[268:15.59]The research.
[268:16.93]Oh yeah, yeah.
[268:20.03]What is in this cabinet?
[268:23.34]What cabinet?
[268:24.18]What are we?
[268:24.56]What are dining table?
[268:25.54]OK, yeah.
[268:28.20]Pizza pizza.
[268:34.15]I really like when you talk that way to me.
[268:38.28]I have never liked you more than when you say to me: pizza pizza pizza pizza.
[268:41.28]That's just what- you just did an AI response... That's how an AI responds to something like that.
[268:57.28]Here like prep- prep the barrel with the pizza, you see what I'm saying?
[269:02.00]Yep.
[269:13.40]Hey guys, welcome over to Pizza Barrel.
[269:17.09]Your pizza's been left waiting for you on the top of the barrel.
[269:21.59]Imagine ordering pizza and seeing that when you come in and the waiter or waitress just picks this up and just places it.
[269:29.78]Be like, excuse me.
[269:30.98]At least put it into the oven for a second.
[269:32.82]At least reheat it, ma'am.
[269:34.84]Alright, let's go.
[269:44.58]I do like this barrel scenario.
[269:52.85]Pizza, pizza, pizza, fry.
[269:55.49]Want me to fry?
[269:56.21]Just need to fry.
[270:06.62]What?
[270:07.18]Why's he handing him the barrel pizza?
[270:11.32]This is really like- if you go to a restaurant the most disgusting thing I can think of is like there's food already prepared on random decor and they just-
[270:19.32]It's already played and like oh you ordered that? Good, we had one ready.
[270:23.32]Yeah.
[270:24.32]Do you eat it?
[270:25.32]Isn't that kind of what fast food restaurants do though? They make it and they put it under the warming lights?
[270:31.32]I think there's a big difference in like: these are warming lights, we designed it for this situation - and it's on the barrel.
[270:36.00]Uh we need double pizza, double fry.
[270:40.70]Yeah, it's not under a warming light.
[270:42.49]It's just on... It'd be like if it was just on the counter.
[270:46.59]It's true.
[270:47.67]Fucking... I hate this thing.
[270:50.61]What is that?
[270:51.41]I'm in a situation.
[270:52.79]What did you just give me?
[270:53.40]Like the charcoal?
[270:54.00]I'm in a situation.
[270:54.76]How can I help?
[270:55.34]How can I help?
[270:55.80]How can I help?
[270:56.32]How can I help?
[270:56.74]I don't know.
[270:57.46]Garbage that.
[270:58.04]How can I help?
[270:58.36]Okay, good.
[271:00.06]Good, good, good.
[271:00.50]Just need fries.
[271:00.94]Okay, just need another fry.
[271:13.25]The pizza.
[271:15.45]The button to open the door and then take out the thing, it's like, I fucked up and then I burned it.
[271:24.23]What if the barrel is heated?
[271:27.13]It's not.
[271:27.87]It has like a cobweb on it.
[271:29.33]That would be pretty dangerous.
[271:37.21]Somebody said, this game has two buttons.
[271:41.73]Yeah, but it's
[271:44.84]could be either one you never know yeah you know what else what other game has two buttons like Dark Souls dodge and swing got you there wrong oh look at that what is it extortion customers pay 50 more to use our fancy table
[272:13.63]We're going to be millionaires.
[272:14.85]How much does it cost?
[272:16.53]Fancy table.
[272:18.85]I mean, let's get it.
[272:20.05]We need another table.
[272:21.92]Can't we just put it on one of our tables that we have already?
[272:23.52]I think it's like a whole extra table.
[272:28.02]Oh.
[272:29.48]Let's get it.
[272:30.58]Yeah, get it.
[272:31.10]Do it.
[272:31.56]Do it.
[272:31.92]Do it.
[272:32.38]Do it.
[272:32.78]Do it.
[272:33.23]Do it.
[272:34.01]You kind of... Only one person should be over here doing this.
[272:39.11]You're doing it.
[272:40.23]You're doing great.
[272:42.17]Um...
[272:43.82]This is going to be interesting.
[272:45.42]We... I think we have to get rid of one of these.
[272:55.79]No, I can swing this.
[272:57.91]You can swing that?
[272:59.19]Can I swing this, you think?
[273:01.12]What if you put one of the tables in the extra room?
[273:04.24]Oh, wait a minute.
[273:05.18]I can do that.
[273:05.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[273:07.90]I can just put them right next with zero people can sit here.
[273:10.60]I'm saying like, what if we do a secret?
[273:14.46]Why can only zero people sit here?
[273:19.87]Oh, I have to move this.
[273:39.03]Are you comfortable with where the barrel is?
[273:42.69]Yeah, I think so.
[273:44.85]I think this is okay.
[273:47.17]Larger table need it.
[273:48.63]We need bigger tables because expected group sizes are four.
[273:52.45]People are saying portioner.
[273:59.44]People are also saying the fancy table should have four because it's the fancy table and they pay more money.
[274:09.81]What would the portioner do for us?
[274:13.07]I don't... I think this is okay.
[274:16.36]Put the barrel back here.
[274:17.42]That sounds okay to me.
[274:18.60]Alright, let's go.
[274:21.58]It slices the pizza for you?
[274:23.48]It slices the pizza for you.
[274:24.68]Auto-cuts the pizza.
[274:26.12]Read chat.
[274:26.84]I'm trying.
[274:27.46]It's a vast chat room right now.
[274:32.12]So, do I make this the portioner?
[274:35.30]And then you can grab the pizza off of it?
[274:39.93]I don't know how it works.
[274:40.73]Should we practice it?
[274:42.67]Yes.
[274:43.09]We're pretty high.
[274:43.89]We're high.
[274:45.35]I don't want to mess this up on some pizza portioner.
[274:50.17]Okay.
[274:50.69]Give it a try.
[274:51.07]Let me just make my 400th pizza today.
[274:57.78]Just leave pizza on the table from when they come in.
[275:00.40]Unfortunately, not how the game works, unfortunately.
[275:03.80]I do agree with you, though.
[275:14.13]so well how does this work um how is this any different than what it was before isn't this just the same thing make it face a counter oh oh oh we gotta restart
[275:44.79]but the plates on the arrow side.
[275:49.63]I think I understand.
[275:51.09]I think I understand.
[275:52.27]Oh, okay.
[276:05.58]Like that.
[276:06.26]I put the pizza here or the other way, the way it was.
[276:08.70]I don't know.
[276:13.48]You're the gamer.
[276:14.18]I don't know.
[276:15.92]I'm not a gamer.
[276:19.49]I think it's like that.
[276:22.94]Let's try it.
[276:23.68]Well, don't start the day.
[276:24.36]Let's practice it.
[276:42.59]I feel like I can really just run my own business after this.
[276:59.27]The other way?
[276:59.81]Why is it upside down?
[277:03.55]Wait, don't... Oh, it's slicing it and then putting it there.
[277:09.75]That kind of doesn't even seem that helpful.
[277:21.99]It only cuts one at a time.
[277:23.41]I mean, if we if we put it in the back, I don't want to have it in the front of the restaurant.
[277:34.44]Taking up the counter space.
[277:35.98]So wait, I'm confused.
[277:37.48]What's happening here?
[277:42.64]Basically.
[277:46.18]Exit exit.
[277:47.88]Wait, I like wrapping my head around.
[277:58.76]keyboard looker Andy yeah I Ster do you do the home row typing or do you look down at your hands like I I've never learned it was horrible to learn that it made me like physically ill look wait wait I'm I'm like I've been playing too long I've been up too long I'm getting mind by this really simple interaction yeah
[278:31.14]So yeah, when you put your hands on the home row, do you type looking down at your hands or have you memorized where all the keys are and you don't have to look down?
[278:41.94]I don't have to look down at my hands.
[278:43.36]We had typing class in school and I was a very fast typer and I enjoyed learning how to type and becoming a faster typer because I would play StarCraft.
[278:51.15]And then if someone typed to me in StarCraft, I can't stop for a full minute to type.
[278:55.43]I would have to learn how to type quick.
[278:58.38]That was all one sentence.
[279:00.14]What you just said.
[279:01.36]Um, okay.
[279:01.92]So, but do you do A S D F J K L semi and do the home row or do you just know where, how do you, what's your placement for your hands?
[279:11.99]Where the, uh, the fricking, the knobs are on the J and the F you put your index fingers on those.
[279:19.11]Yeah, that's called home role placement.
[279:21.90]Okay, yeah, you don't have to look down.
[279:23.22]You just know where that is.
[279:25.34]How else would you place your hand on a keyboard?
[279:27.06]But you have a mechanical keyboard, right?
[279:29.58]Yeah.
[279:30.46]Whenever I do that, I feel like I get stuck moving my fingers around.
[279:35.17]I feel like I get kind of trapped in between the little divots.
[279:39.59]You know what I mean?
[279:41.21]Then I press the wrong things.
[279:43.39]Well, I don't understand your problem.
[279:46.83]because if you play Diablo II and you need to use your potions on one two three four then you can also just easily go from wasd and all the buttons that you need up to one and fours and you learn how to do the numbers as well your hands are always in the right spot I can do wasd without looking one two three four space control I can do pretty much everything it's just needing to go to like type words right so w one two three four wasd q e r t it's everything over here right
[280:12.03]is fine I don't need to look but the issue is going from pressing j to e to like b to j and e are on other sides of the keyboard what's the problem that's what I mean like is it like a brain issue or a keyboard issue it's a brain issue because what I'm talking about is trying to have this same problem if you try and write on paper no I could write I could write on paper without looking
[280:43.75]I could just write my name without looking so you know where all the numbers and letters are on the keyboard but when you try and form a word my fingers can't find them because I have never locked into complete muscle memory the exact spacing for all the letters on the keyboard can can you boot up like type racer.com right now I mean like I would I wouldn't be able to do it I would love to see that
[281:12.49]I would love to see you look straight ahead into the camera and not look down at your hands and play Type Racer.
[281:21.58]Can I rain check this?
[281:22.50]I'm tired.
[281:24.46]I feel like it's not that big of a deal.
[281:26.61]I'm tired, though.
[281:30.93]It's going to be awful.
[281:32.13]Well, isn't that what everyone wants to see?
[281:36.20]Let me drink like a coffee and eat like a piece of salmon.
[281:38.58]It doesn't represent me.
[281:39.48]It doesn't represent me.
[281:40.54]Let me eat a piece of salmon and drink a coffee like an espresso and get a full eight hours of sleep.
[281:47.99]Okay?
[281:48.81]Okay.
[281:49.19]Rain check on the type racer.
[281:50.93]Yes.
[281:54.79]Don't worry, I'll tell you.
[281:55.55]I will follow up on this.
[281:56.93]We're gonna play Elden Ring co-op anyways, so, I mean, we can start with that.
[282:01.63]Okay.
[282:03.01]I wanna eat a piece of salmon, I wanna eat spinach and shit, and I wanna have, like, an espresso, and I wanna have a full eight hours of sleep.
[282:11.03]If you really need to rest up for this, like, triathlon, you're gonna run.
[282:15.74]You're a coward.
[282:17.02]I know, you can say that.
[282:22.51]they can and they are I'm just honestly I'm just like too lazy to just minimize this window I think that's what's going on here but like
[282:32.22]It's just minimizing a game that you're barely paying attention to at this point.
[282:36.24]We're going to lose the next mission because I started talking to you and you've had a conversation since the last one.
[282:40.97]And this is the problem, right?
[282:42.61]Look, we're doing pretty good.
[282:44.11]If we disappear out to do a type racer, we're going to come back, we're going to be rusty, and it's going to be awful.
[282:49.49]I think it's already beyond the point where that's going to happen.
[282:55.80]Therm is just like me.
[283:02.19]I'm really concerned for this next day.
[283:04.54]We're going to be fine.
[283:05.62]Stop.
[283:06.64]I don't know how the fuck this thing works or why I'm using it.
[283:09.74]Why did we buy it?
[283:11.32]Let's start.
[283:11.88]Okay.
[283:15.16]Just like me.
[283:18.00]Just pay attention.
[283:19.17]We have to at least get further than we ever have.
[283:20.85]I think this already is.
[283:23.81]Not yet.
[283:24.15]I think we have one more.
[283:26.39]Alright.
[283:27.27]Pizza, pizza, pizza.
[283:28.09]That's all it is.
[283:35.10]Your customers don't respect you.
[283:36.34]I don't know what this thing does.
[283:40.32]Did I put the pizza... Did I put the plate... Did I put the plate here?
[283:42.70]I guess I... Whatever.
[283:58.59]Do I... Do I do it into one of these plate trays?
[284:00.85]Like, to make it actually helpful in any way?
[284:04.61]He's dumb, Sag.
[284:06.61]I don't know if you're talking about me or him.
[284:07.75]You're probably talking about collectively.
[284:10.65]Alright, we need pizza, pizza, pizza.
[284:13.20]All pizzas, one fry.
[284:15.24]Pizza, one fry.
[284:23.50]Just make... Chop that, chop that, chop that.
[284:25.40]Oh, just make a huge pizza.
[284:40.97]I see.
[284:41.65]I see.
[284:42.25]I understand.
[284:42.94]Are we ready?
[284:43.60]Ready?
[284:44.22]Yeah, yeah.
[284:49.84]You fry on that one.
[284:53.38]OK, now we need pizza, pizza, pizza, just three pizzas.
[285:17.59]Okay, I am about to start.
[285:24.19]Good.
[285:25.09]Okay, now we need... This is a big fry.
[285:27.48]Two fries, pizza, pizza, pizza, three pizza, fry.
[285:30.22]We just need one pizza, pizza, fry, fry, fry, pizza, fry.
[285:32.72]Pizza, pizza, fry.

[285:34.84]The amount of focus.
[285:47.10]Now I just need one more pizza.
[285:49.64]Oh, you fuck.
[285:51.98]It's okay.
[285:52.94]I can burn the time.
[285:55.24]I can burn the time.
[285:57.04]Don't burn the pizza.
[285:57.74]I can burn the time.
[286:11.05]We're good.
[286:11.61]There's still time.
[286:14.39]And...
[286:16.60]Just needed one slice.
[286:19.16]Got it?
[286:19.40]Okay.
[286:21.52]Uh, full pizza, one fry.
[286:23.06]Pizza, pizza, pizza, fry.
[286:24.40]Just, all you need to worry about is make a fucking pizza and put a french fry on one of them.
[286:33.08]And we did it.
[286:36.76]Two fries, I meant to say.
[286:37.66]Two fries.
[286:38.32]We need two french fries.
[286:50.92]Two fries and then two slices.
[286:52.54]Running low on time.
[287:06.24]My God, I can't get in the fucking room.
[287:09.24]OK, here we go.
[287:11.82]Just need two slices.
[287:19.92]I've got doing, doing, doing, doing, doing, doing.
[287:24.73]Alright.
[287:26.55]Is it going good?
[287:30.19]This is the furthest we've ever been.
[287:32.37]Three star streamer, my streamer.
[287:41.13]Less money.
[287:42.90]Yeah, we've got enough money.
[287:45.04]I don't know about this pumpkin soup.
[287:48.66]So what did this do?
[287:51.65]Freezer?
[287:54.21]Items inside are not removed overnight.
[287:57.19]Ooh!
[287:58.75]Boinko!
[287:59.67]Wait, you could freeze pizzas?
[288:01.01]Could you make a bunch of frozen pizzas?
[288:02.82]Yeah.
[288:06.18]That's kind of awesome.
[288:12.02]Oops.
[288:14.52]For those emergencies where like four dudes are like, hey, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.
[288:18.60]Just pull one out of the freezer and say, yeah, we cook this fresh.
[288:22.61]Gordon won't even know.
[288:23.61]Should we upgrade something?
[288:26.35]Another table?
[288:28.51]To have a double tablecloth table?
[288:36.40]Uh, sure.
[288:40.37]Okay.
[288:40.77]I mean, I think we're pretty much ready to go.
[288:43.58]Okay.
[288:43.82]Let me mentally refresh.
[288:45.28]I'm making pizzas.
[288:47.48]Yes, you are.
[288:48.84]I am making pizzas and French fries.
[288:51.54]You're making French fries too.
[288:53.54]There's something I forgot.
[289:01.27]Wait, what am I making?
[289:02.69]Making pizza and French fries.
[289:06.65]You're just making pizza at the moment.
[289:12.61]Don't screw it up.
[289:21.76]Grab it.
[289:24.24]You're good.
[289:26.26]But I want to be the best.
[289:27.20]Bro, I don't care how bad the review is.
[289:28.96]I just care that we beat the game.
[289:30.19]That's valid.
[289:41.16]Oh, I cannot put these plates down.
[289:43.40]Alright, they, uh... We need a... We... Oh, you're right.
[289:46.21]We need a fry.
[289:47.39]Just... We need one french fry.
[289:59.01]Is that good?
[289:59.97]Uh, yeah.
[290:00.59]I can grab it.
[290:02.69]We have too many plates.
[290:10.37]Here, I'll move some plates.
[290:13.77]Uh, we need, uh, french fry.
[290:16.27]We need to slice in front.
[290:17.17]Slice, slice, french fry.
[290:28.33]Very good.
[290:29.90]Hey, look at this.
[290:30.38]This is, like, easier than the last level.
[290:39.50]Uh, I think the knife that I finally remembered to put on helped a lot.
[290:43.42]That, like, the whole tomato process of the pizza, like, I'm jamming these pizzas straight out.
[290:49.06]Yeah, you're doing pretty good.
[290:51.71]Alright, we need, uh, just pizza.
[290:53.53]I got it right here.
[290:55.65]Look at that.
[290:56.25]Done.
[290:58.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[290:59.15]What's wrong?
[291:02.21]Oh, you want to freeze one?
[291:03.49]I'm freezing this one.
[291:04.57]Yeah, freeze it.
[291:05.85]Oh, tomorrow.
[291:07.92]That's going to be good.
[291:12.35]Still have too many plates over here.
[291:21.12]Just regular pizza.
[291:23.80]Dude, I think these are the last customers.
[291:25.24]Make like three more pizzas.
[291:26.38]How many can fit in the freezer?
[291:29.06]Okay, I will start another pizza.
[291:31.50]I'll help you make one.
[291:33.33]Let's make like five.
[291:37.87]I don't... I... I'm... You're making me nervous.
[291:41.95]Oh, should I just put that with that?
[291:43.01]Alright, I just need two slices.
[291:51.54]Oh, it's only one.
[291:52.48]I just spit everywhere.
[291:53.98]It's only one.
[291:54.52]Oh, fuck!
[291:55.16]Never mind, we're good.
[291:55.96]Okay, good thing we didn't do that.
[291:56.98]Uh, I need two slices.
[292:07.14]Okay.
[292:08.88]I need a french fry.
[292:10.46]One french fry.
[292:11.14]We're good to go.
[292:11.80]Game over.
[292:12.14]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[292:30.57]Need a plate.
[292:36.65]bingo look at that we can go bingo and we have a frozen pizza ready for whenever we need it we can only put one in there so we're good to go can these fucks please put the portioner next to the sink before I blow a gasket is that what you said I think that I might be it was close enough it was something like that
[293:05.53]Okay, we have a lot of things going on here.
[293:09.27]Rug.
[293:13.01]We have a lot of money.
[293:13.79]We should put some decorations.
[293:15.97]We haven't done any upgrades.
[293:18.25]Bookcase.
[293:19.97]Plant.
[293:22.51]Put a rug down.
[293:23.19]Alright, I'm buying a rug.
[293:28.75]Yeah, we get patience if we get decorations down.
[293:31.89]Christmas tree?
[293:32.53]You want a Christmas tree?
[293:35.21]Uh, no.
[293:38.28]Ah, no, no, no.
[293:39.00]I'll buy another rug.
[293:40.88]Here's a highly flammable rug.
[293:42.30]Okay, so now we have patience increased.
[293:50.26]Cabinet?
[293:50.78]Can the rugs not go under the tables?
[293:53.12]Metal table?
[293:58.51]50% less food and what is that trying to say?
[294:08.45]I think they order less, but they have less patients.
[294:12.69]Sides are optional.
[294:14.35]Oh, you don't have to put fries on their plate.
[294:19.77]So you could actually just not put French fries in front of them.
[294:24.60]That's actually kind of good.
[294:31.53]I don't know.
[294:31.81]What do you think?
[294:33.20]I'm trying to understand what this person told me.
[294:36.64]You want to be faster.
[294:37.70]You put the sink next to the oil.
[294:41.20]You can skip the rolling dough step.
[294:51.21]I'm still confused.
[294:59.18]The oil in the sink.
[295:01.80]What?
[295:09.11]Yeah, we don't have a normal sink anymore.
[295:10.79]Bro, move the portioner.
[295:12.41]There's a lot of negative comments coming in to you.
[295:18.95]It was... I saw someone do like the... People on my chat are saying that that's like a glitch.
[295:24.64]That's like an exploit.
[295:26.48]I'm getting the...
[295:28.93]Wait, why?
[295:29.37]What did I say?
[295:30.43]You know that emote where it goes... Yeah, but what's the problem with me?
[295:35.82]They're saying that that's too far away from the sink.
[295:39.20]What's too far away from the sink?
[295:41.04]The portioner.
[295:41.50]Apparently that should be next to the sink.
[295:45.82]Why?
[295:46.14]I don't understand.
[295:48.71]portioner above the barrel so it puts the it puts the pizzas over so I can grab them what just happened ow that hurt what happened to me what just happened to me it goes closer to the barrel so then it puts the portioned food in front of me so I can take it that they want that so I put the pizza here and it goes over and then you get the pizza and you put the put on the plate
[296:16.23]I think that's how it works.
[296:17.43]I like bumped my headphone here and it went in my ear.
[296:23.36]Yes.
[296:23.72]Yes.
[296:24.08]Yes.
[296:24.42]Finally.
[296:24.88]Yes.
[296:25.20]Yes.
[296:25.42]That works.
[296:25.82]Yes.
[296:26.50]But also some people said no.
[296:28.26]Stop sending psychic waves to him.
[296:33.33]Next to the sink.
[296:34.53]Oh my god.
[296:38.07]These instructions, let me read this.
[296:40.21]Upside down T shape next to sink with counter but pizza so it goes down.
[296:44.86]Just practice it so we can see what this does.
[296:47.40]We're way too far to have this be messed up.
[296:49.60]What does that mean?
[296:50.42]What are these words?
[296:54.51]What's the upside down T shape?
[296:56.59]I'm getting a Christmas tree.
[297:02.61]I feel like we were doing fine.
[297:21.87]like you're doing fine chat is just trying very hard drama every pizza I make yeah it's going in the trash why what are you doing uh don't do that I don't know
[297:49.00]I'm ready.
[297:49.40]I'm super happy with what we have.
[297:51.04]It's getting overcomplicated by like too many cooks in the kitchen right now.
[297:55.34]There's also too many chairs in the kitchen.
[298:00.82]Can we do an outside seating?
[298:02.02]We're good.
[298:06.05]You sure?
[298:07.77]We can handle it.
[298:08.83]We've handled it before.
[298:17.22]Alright, just go for it.
[298:18.12]Pizza.
[298:18.48]That's all you need to do.
[298:19.42]You're a master of it.
[298:20.38]You know it.
[298:20.88]You know the sauce.
[298:21.60]You know the ingredients.
[298:22.20]You know the cheese.
[298:22.78]The fresh mozzarella.
[298:24.32]The fresh basil.
[298:25.06]I'm glad that I'm getting some of the fucking respect that I deserve.
[298:34.29]You got that?
[298:34.67]You can plate those?
[298:36.13]Yeah, but now I see what people mean.
[298:39.25]Okay, well then you're going to have to set it up next time because I am dense as fucking granite.
[298:50.88]Alright, we have another group coming in.
[298:54.14]The soccer game just got out and here are all those kids.
[298:57.24]We need something here.
[298:58.46]What do we need?
[298:58.81]We need pizza.
[298:59.57]We need... This is cringy.
[299:16.91]Is there not enough?
[299:19.94]I'm just waiting for there to be enough.
[299:21.96]Isn't there enough?
[299:26.80]This isn't a fucked up spot.
[299:29.00]Yeah, I don't.
[299:29.62]I think we're fine though.
[299:31.39]I was happy.
[299:32.35]I was happy before.
[299:33.25]I was happy before all this.
[299:34.71]We're still fine.
[299:37.03]We need pizza.
[299:38.13]We need french fries.
[299:43.34]And hey, kids, how about an extra large fry?
[299:46.52]Alright, we need... I don't have anywhere to put the fucking tomatoes every time I want to cut them.
[300:03.26]We need one fry.
[300:05.54]Don't repeat what I said and then say -2.
[300:07.48]That's not funny.
[300:08.46]That's not fair.
[300:13.92]Yes, chef.
[300:15.88]Are we okay?
[300:16.76]You ready?
[300:17.02]Are we?
[300:22.94]Just need one more slice.
[300:31.21]We don't need to tap into the freezer yet.
[300:32.23]We're good.
[300:32.61]Okay, we need a french fry.
[300:45.25]I'm not going to press that yet.
[300:53.44]Fry down.
[300:57.98]I can't reach from here.
[301:03.79]Coming out with the fry.
[301:06.61]And this group wants... You shouldn't have done that.
[301:10.57]This one just pizza pizza.
[301:12.59]Got that right here.
[301:24.07]This is not what the bug doctor prescribed.
[301:31.47]Whatever happened to just good old fashioned home cooking where like you don't have to worry about these like conveyor belts and auto plating.
[301:38.96]Alexa, make me a pizza, please.
[301:41.84]Need a french fry.
[301:50.20]I can't reach that pizza.
[301:53.55]That is a huge knife.
[301:54.49]That's actually kind of scary.
[301:56.07]In the wind, swinging it.
[302:02.89]Ster, I think we're actually going to beat this.
[302:05.07]I think so too.
[302:06.11]I think I hate it.
[302:07.58]That whole layout.
[302:08.40]I was really happy with what it was before.
[302:10.08]I was really content to just move my pizzas around myself.
[302:13.96]You get a little hands on with the dough.
[302:15.42]You can really feel it.
[302:16.34]You know, it's like a rustic kind of like connection to the food.
[302:19.12]Now actually put the portion next to the sink.
[302:26.08]Make sure it's facing the right way.
[302:27.08]Because now I can just go like... Much easier.
[302:33.72]Okay.
[302:36.02]And then what if it goes too fast and it shoots straight into the sink?
[302:39.94]And that would be a funny LOL moment because we're at the end of the game.
[302:46.02]okay and what it okay here's the legitimate serious I'm not messing around what if okay I put a pizza here it shoots over a slice here it's shooting it's gonna shoot a slice that I can grab and put on the plate immediately you you need a french fry let's where do I where do I put where do I put the french fry that's what the practice is for
[303:25.97]You can put plates on top of the portioner.
[303:32.73]Ah, so then would you just... Can you load it with a bunch?
[303:36.42]No.
[303:36.72]No.
[303:38.32]Okay, wait, wait.
[303:38.92]Here, I just want to explain what I'm talking about.
[303:43.38]So don't, like, grab this.
[303:45.70]Don't go crazy.
[303:46.80]Put pizza down.
[303:47.62]Pizza goes onto the plate.
[303:48.79]Boink.
[303:50.27]Next pizza's ready.
[303:51.41]Okay, so now that's a little bit of a problem.
[303:53.97]When we need a french fry... Okay.
[303:58.57]Are you then waiting for me to put a plate down?
[304:01.95]I would need you to put the plate down.
[304:03.01]Okay, so if I put a plate down, can you... That works.
[304:06.21]No, that's okay.
[304:06.57]But then, am I making french fries to order then?
[304:09.69]Like, what if two french fries are coming up?
[304:12.29]I could plate down over here.
[304:13.73]You'd have to put one down over there.
[304:15.58]Put sink in corner?
[304:16.60]Never.
[304:17.08]And not on a plate?
[304:18.32]Just don't put it on anything.
[304:19.54]Just put it on the ground.
[304:24.45]Okay, I'm good.
[304:26.20]I'm good.
[304:26.46]I'm good.
[304:26.78]Are you good?
[304:27.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[304:28.22]Go.
[304:28.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[304:35.82]This is a change.
[304:37.90]This is a change.
[304:38.62]Wait, you changed it.
[304:39.94]I did change it.
[304:40.84]And why is this changing again?
[304:44.37]Because it is.
[304:45.91]You understand that it's harder for me to go diagonal and put stuff in the sink, though.
[304:50.48]Why?
[304:51.24]Because it's like, it's, it's a kind of a finicky little spot.
[304:53.33]It's a tiny, it's like two or three frames.
[304:54.69]It's like two or three frames.
[304:55.33]You already had to do that before to grab the plates.
[304:58.05]Yeah, but it's so much easier for me to just go ba-boom.
[305:01.49]But like, does this thing automatically plate things if the plates are there?
[305:06.05]I don't like it.
[305:09.11]I don't like it.
[305:21.78]See?
[305:22.18]Do you see what's going on right now?
[305:24.08]It's because there's a little area.
[305:25.68]I'm playing on... Remember, I have controller.
[305:27.78]That's not an issue for me.
[305:29.10]I'm playing controller.
[305:31.52]So I have like a tiny little window here.
[305:33.08]Let's go for it.
[305:37.40]We're good.
[305:40.13]Rotate the potion so it takes the pizza from above, not the right.
[305:44.71]Oh, dude.
[305:45.25]Yeah.
[305:46.63]That's exactly what should be happening because then...
[305:51.24]No, okay, so... You want to put the portioner... So... Yeah, I get it.
[305:57.76]So you can put that... You can put pizzas there, so it sucks it that way.
[306:03.07]Okay, and then I put the fries here.
[306:05.55]Yes.
[306:08.49]No?
[306:08.71]Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[306:11.27]Mr. PleaseBeSmarter, I checked out an hour ago.
[306:14.33]I'm ready for bed.
[306:15.32]There are 20,000 chefs in... Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[306:24.26]We're going for it.
[306:27.56]Okay.
[306:28.64]This is it.
[306:29.12]This is it.
[306:30.46]I mean, we have... We're this far.
[306:33.22]Let's just change the layout of our kitchen every service.
[306:36.51]We'll get real used to that and get real efficient.
[306:40.95]Hey, your chat's the one saying all that stuff.
[306:42.79]I look over here and I just see people talking, but I look like a fucking elf.
[306:48.79]I wish my chat would call me a fucking elf.
[306:50.98]Pizza, pizza, pizza.
[306:57.85]Yeah, I look over here and there's people just say like, dude, he has like boogers in his nose and stuff like it.
[307:01.19]Okay, I need a french fry.
[307:12.74]This is a pretty good start.
[307:22.45]We have a lot of food.
[307:26.63]There's your freaking french fry, dude.
[307:28.03]Okay, so I need you to put that french fry onto that plate.
[307:36.31]You're okay, bro.
[307:38.03]Thanks, bro.
[307:39.09]Anything you need.
[307:39.85]Okay, let me just get this loaded up.
[307:51.71]This is gonna mess me up.
[307:52.50]Okay, so the... We need a french fry.
[307:54.56]Okay.
[307:57.45]Toss a french fry on that.
[307:59.23]Oh, we got a big party.
[308:00.60]Hey, the soccer game.
[308:04.40]I'm not going to do it.
[308:05.42]Everybody relax.
[308:08.48]Okay, I've got it.
[308:14.93]Everyone was so ready to press the button.
[308:21.87]You're doing it anyways.
[308:23.23]I didn't even do it.
[308:24.49]A bunch of jokers.
[308:32.30]What do we got?
[308:33.52]We got two french fries.
[308:35.54]Good.
[308:54.68]Oh, yeah.
[308:56.10]And now we need a french fry.
[309:02.71]Oh, we have enough pizza.
[309:03.43]Oh, the party of four just came in.
[309:08.98]That was close.
[309:20.91]Oh, that's a pizza.
[309:23.13]That's a fucking pizza right there.
[309:24.75]Okay, we need to... Two fries, two fries, two fries.
[309:28.83]Actually, this is getting a little hairy.
[309:30.31]Two fries.
[309:32.90]Last two parties here.
[309:38.25]We need a pizza, two fries.
[309:39.79]Why would you say to me this is getting hairy and we have like a full duration?
[309:44.51]You look at the left.
[309:48.55]Your food's all done.
[309:49.99]Yeah, but it's scary.
[309:51.33]I need to fry.
[309:53.15]Fry.
[309:57.65]God, some people.
[310:00.58]Some people.
[310:03.18]I feel like I'm underappreciated here at my job and I'm looking for new employment.
[310:06.74]Alright, we need one fry.
[310:11.47]That's all we need is one fry.
[310:13.11]That's what he says.
[310:13.97]One fry and we got a frozen pizza in there if we need it.
[310:15.57]Are you good?
[310:19.61]Anyone looking to hire a totally incompetent, doesn't know how to place the portioner cook.
[310:26.05]You've actually been doing a great job.
[310:28.21]We just need one fry, so I'll give you a plate.
[310:31.91]Thank you.
[310:35.56]There is the upgrade that allows you to carry two plates as well.
[310:38.44]That might make this, if we can get it, a lot easier for you.
[310:43.94]No, that was okay.
[310:45.20]You know, the issue is we need... There were three parties of four at one point, and they were sitting outside.
[310:53.77]We need to have three tables of four.
[310:55.53]Because people were waiting.
[311:01.59]Um...
[311:04.71]Can we actually place tables outside?
[311:06.23]I feel like I'm scared to add any food.
[311:13.61]No, and it even says they take a lot of work.
[311:15.65]Yeah.
[311:17.20]You cannot.
[311:18.10]Just remove.
[311:18.64]I'm going to remove one of the tables and just make another four.
[311:23.70]You don't have room for three parties of four.
[311:26.70]What do we do?
[311:33.44]We could use that.
[311:34.08]Yeah, we could use the smaller room.
[311:35.98]Convert the small room.
[311:37.80]It has a lot of penalties.
[311:40.08]I don't think it matters anymore.
[311:41.52]We have so much money.
[311:42.48]It's really just like... Can we finish?
[311:48.49]Yeah.
[311:49.67]I mean, we have three levels to do, so we need to make sure we did this right.
[311:56.43]We have this service thing.
[311:57.41]We haven't used this one time.
[312:04.23]uh honestly we could get rid of the research I don't think we need to clear this whole room out yeah just make it I'll move the freezer and everything into the kitchen because this is this is the expensive private dining area right this is the way this is extra money for this table yeah that's where you go to like really be in a kitchen room that gives me more room here too so that's good
[312:31.35]Mmm, the trash.
[312:32.49]Do we even use the trash for anything, really?
[312:34.65]Seats two.
[312:35.59]Oh, this is a table.
[312:36.65]Customers share, but they eat longer because it's romantic.
[312:42.51]Should we just use that?
[312:44.48]Replace this three?
[312:46.40]I think two fours... Like, we still can have a group of two show up.
[312:52.34]I don't know if we can fit it anywhere.
[312:55.68]We should put the tablecloth on one, is what people are saying.
[312:59.04]Do we have one?
[312:59.52]Do we have a tablecloth?
[313:03.23]no this is the table table simple cloth it's like a it's like a whole two table napkins prevent mess when you put it on a table just spend our money on whatever yeah we have so much money okay but you have to actually I mean can I it's the very beginning just put these everywhere I guess I mean I'm not researching anything
[313:33.24]Cabinets, please.
[313:35.46]Just one per table?
[313:36.48]Okay.
[313:38.04]Yeah, you restocked them.
[313:38.83]Alright.
[313:39.21]Well, whatever.
[313:39.69]Let's go for it.
[313:41.33]You think you got it?
[313:42.09]Yeah.
[313:46.51]I'm a pizza machine.
[313:47.69]Okay, let's do it.
[313:50.54]Ster, we're going to be some of the only people to ever complete the game.
[313:53.76]It's an achievement.
[313:54.30]0.00002.
[313:54.32]Have I ever done it?
[313:59.57]They also say that, uh, Ster and Jerma have never completed this before.
[314:03.87]So this will be actually a world first.
[314:06.75]Uh, we need two slices of pizza.
[314:14.20]Ask them if they want the one out the freezer.
[314:16.06]They want a fresh one.
[314:16.90]I don't want to fucking cook another pizza.
[314:27.10]I can tell you're tired.
[314:30.42]Party of four coming in, and they're going to the fancy room.
[314:33.38]Be ready.
[314:33.72]Uh-oh.
[314:34.98]Fancy, guys.
[314:38.26]It's kind of late for me.

[315:07.49]You got it.

[315:10.67]That's actually kind of far.
[315:11.82]OK, we need just three pieces of pizza, which I think we almost have it.
[315:15.84]Oh, I gotta clean that up.
[315:28.70]No shit.
[315:30.76]I think this game would be much worse if it didn't have the when you finish things like that's keeping me going.
[315:37.15]We're OK.
[315:39.67]Hi, it's just pizza, so I'm going to go for it.
[315:41.23]Let's start it.

[318:45.41]Hey, frozen pizza probably lasts for months.
[318:48.93]Alright, I'm going to hold off for a second.
[318:51.90]Give you a little bit of time to make that cheese.
[318:55.46]And OK, we need just pizza.
[319:04.72]Pizza feels like one of the easier ones too, because like I'm just it's all they want and I'm just banging out pizzas.

[319:15.28]No, no, no.
[319:15.88]Relax.

[320:33.79]I'm going to have to make another pizza.
[320:36.05]Unless you want to... No, keep the frozen one for next.
[320:37.93]That's the last level.

[321:16.42]After this, give me a hand picking up these plates.
[321:18.98]Can you grab the ones that they're about to dump on the left side next to you?
[321:24.11]Yeah.
[321:24.51]Yeah, that's easier.
[321:35.18]Another group.
[321:36.08]Another group.

[321:48.43]Only pizza.
[321:49.05]Perfect.
[321:49.35]We're done.
[321:53.31]Last level.
[321:53.67]Here we go.
[321:59.73]Well, not quite.
[322:01.85]Two people left.
[322:05.36]Oh, they don't even count as real people.
[322:08.24]That's all good.
[322:10.63]No fries.
[322:12.01]Yep.
[322:12.41]Thank God.
[322:12.89]Alright.
[322:17.45]So is the last level going to be hard?
[322:20.21]The last level, I'm pretty sure you have to fight Godfrey.
[322:24.61]The first Elden Lord.
[322:25.76]You guys have worked an eight hour shift without any food.
[322:30.34]True.
[322:32.54]We just have worked a pizza shift here.
[322:38.76]I've been live nine hours.
[322:42.77]Is there decorations?
[322:43.63]Because we could really use the last two if there is.
[322:45.57]Is this a decoration?
[322:51.91]Night only candle?
[322:52.99]No.
[322:56.44]We can just re-roll until we get them.
[323:00.76]Decorations.
[323:04.48]Decorations.
[323:08.40]No.
[323:14.25]No.
[323:16.69]Wait, what is this?
[323:17.67]Oh.
[323:22.54]No decorations?
[323:25.66]oh man that's actually bonkers hold up you're gonna get it stores identical pieces of food yeah so you could like chop four potatoes and put them on that I think that's cool but you've just added a variable in the last level just be careful yeah it's a space I didn't need okay maybe you can't re-roll um
[323:53.89]I don't think you can re-roll into like just decorations.
[323:59.87]Expanded bin!
[324:02.93]Ster is going to throw for views.
[324:05.17]I don't think that's happening.
[324:07.53]I'm winning for views because winning and being cool is also poggers.
[324:13.47]You don't have to just like cheat on your wife to make it to livestream fails.
[324:16.67]Should we have some music for this one?
[324:20.20]Or we just want to just lock in?
[324:22.60]You know what?

[328:40.32]We got it.
[328:42.24]That's it.
[328:43.20]I gotta make another pizza.
[328:44.08]We did it!
[328:44.58]I gotta make another pizza.
[328:46.08]No you don't.
[328:46.80]No you don't.
[328:47.16]We're good.
[328:47.80]No.
[328:48.16]No.
[328:48.42]You don't have to make another pizza for the rest of your life.
[328:50.16]What is my purpose if I don't have to make more pizzas?
[328:52.34]I'm without purpose!
[328:54.34]I need to make a pizza!
[328:54.94]One more!
[329:00.54]Five star restaurant.
[329:02.76]We did it.
[329:03.08]I'm a five star man.
[329:04.69]I'm a five star man.
[329:08.35]When you complete this run, you'll be able to convert three of your cards into a franchise and continue in a new location.
[329:16.41]They really got us.
[329:18.01]Oh.
[329:18.21]Capitalism really got us.
[329:20.27]We just beat the tutorial.
[329:20.97]We were off the train.
[329:24.22]Shops offer flower pots or 50% chance that blueprints can be purchased again.
[329:32.35]I mean, I think we're done.
[329:34.35]I mean, we're done, but let's just take the flowers.
[329:36.48]Because we weren't getting decorations when we wanted them.
[329:39.76]So what happens now?
[329:42.80]What happens now is I probably eat dinner.
[329:45.64]Oh, I think it's just like a new game plus.
[329:47.48]We just go.
[329:48.92]Keep going.
[329:49.79]Oh, you go as many days.
[329:52.03]Overtime day one.
[329:53.11]That's what it is.
[329:54.63]I'm good.
[329:56.55]I'm good.
[329:58.85]Well, that was really fun.
[330:00.57]Yeah, that was intense.
[330:04.11]Simple yet intense.
[330:06.31]Enjoyable.
[330:06.83]Okay, so with two people, it's kind of manageable.
[330:09.41]I think with three or four people, that's where this game becomes kind of a mess.
[330:14.46]I think it's harder the more people you have.
[330:16.14]Well, I've never played like Overcooked either, which I know a lot of people really like in this genre.
[330:21.54]I thought this one looked a lot simpler.
[330:23.48]I like the idea of this because it was like a consistent one kitchen game.
[330:26.86]could work in but overcooked uh I don't know after like I enjoyed that a lot so maybe we could try that sometime no that's cool and we'll um we'll figure out the Elden Ring thing that sounds fun yeah and you're gonna be playing jade cocoon until then I mean cool I'll try to get it cool cool
[330:47.84]Yeah, it's always a pleasure, dude.
[330:49.51]I'll see you probably, I don't know, next week, week or two.
[330:52.43]I'll see you when I see you.
[330:53.71]Yeah, have a good one.
[330:54.83]Take it easy.
[330:55.79]That's Stirr, everybody.
[330:57.03]You all know who Stirr is.
[330:58.69]You all know me.
[331:00.67]Come on.
[331:03.69]Y'all know me.
[331:06.67]Oh, I thought he just booted me.
[331:07.99]He did.
[331:12.80]Very cool.
[331:13.92]Always fun to hang out with Stirr.
[331:17.19]we will see him again probably in the next couple weeks do some Elden Ring Elden Ring randomizer I'm very tired and I'm very hungry so I am going to get out of here I think that guy would probably like ludwig don't you think it's like like caught in 4k right like this
[331:46.32]Jesus.
[331:47.76]I'm getting fucking old.
[331:50.82]Probably, yeah.
[331:57.09]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[331:58.33]The plan for the next stream is... Let me just get out of here.
[332:07.90]Keep an eye on the stuff.
[332:08.68]It'll be either Thursday or Friday.
[332:09.92]Probably Friday.
[332:11.80]And we are going to do some old console stuff.
[332:16.32]So I got Driver 1.
[332:18.04]I have a dozen old Xbox games.
[332:20.81]We're going to load up the Xbox.
[332:23.09]I have Enter the Matrix for the Xbox.
[332:26.67]We're going to do the thing we've done before, kind of back in like 2017, 2018.
[332:29.61]We're doing a console fuckface night.
[332:35.52]Just the same rules.
[332:39.20]30 minutes each game, you have to move on.
[332:41.58]Unless I get addicted.
[332:44.30]Should be a good time.
[332:45.00]I have a lot of shit that's still over there, so... Should be a wild night.
[332:49.76]That will be Friday.
[332:50.72]We're gonna start with Driver.
[332:53.32]So, the person that's been wanting me to play that for a long time.
[332:58.74]If I end up making it Thursday, just keep an eye on the sus, like I said.
[333:01.20]It'll be Thursday or Friday.
[333:02.58]But plan on Friday.
[333:06.87]You still have the New Year's Eve poll.
[333:09.79]Yeah, that's true.
[333:13.46]That's true.
[333:16.32]I'll take care of that right now.
[333:18.72]Thanks for hanging out late night.
[333:19.76]I know it's been a long stream.
[333:22.52]Longer.
[333:23.02]Well, not necessarily long long, but you know.
[333:24.52]We kind of had to see that through.
[333:33.39]Let me do that right now.
[333:40.46]That game's really fun.
[333:44.94]It does remind me of Overcooked.
[333:46.56]But it reminds me of Overcooked.
[333:50.20]But I almost like it a little better than Overcooked.
[333:52.60]Because Overcooked is more individual levels.
[333:57.44]You know, in increasing difficulty, different environments.
[333:59.82]Each level was a little different.
[334:01.94]That felt like you were running your own roguelike restaurant.
[334:05.93]So, it's fun.
[334:07.29]I like it.
[334:09.65]I can't imagine doing some of the more difficult things though.
[334:14.35]Overcooked is fun too though.
[334:17.27]And that Firefighter game was fun as well.
[334:19.97]I didn't dislike that game.
[334:21.63]Don't let Ster put words in my mouth.
[334:28.40]Yeah.
[334:30.40]Thanks for hanging out.
[334:31.34]Appreciate it.
[334:34.60]See you guys on Friday.
[334:36.62]Call your mother.
[334:40.63]Get some sleep.
[334:41.09]Some of you have probably been up for a pretty long time.
[334:46.58]And I'll see you soon.
[334:50.40]Take it easy.
[335:37.03]you
[336:11.89]you
