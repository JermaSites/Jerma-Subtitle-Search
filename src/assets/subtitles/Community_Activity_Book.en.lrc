[00:05.42]I made it.
[00:05.88]I just had to pee.
[00:08.45]I was here.
[00:08.85]I just peed.

[00:12.31]I did.
[00:14.85]There's a di- oh!
[00:20.85]I don't know those have been making me real irritated lately. Like just today.
[00:24.85]Only today. Usually I like don't give a shit at all about that.
[00:28.85]And it's like: okay, that's funny, it's like the vroomer.
[00:30.85]That person has driven past here like 12 times in the last like 6 minutes.
[00:39.85]And after 10 is when you start to be like: alright, like can you just get to where you're going?
[00:46.07]What is your destination at this point?
[00:53.11]At this point, I'm convinced that you're on an AI path.
[00:58.54]Do I need to go out there and activate the cutscene or something?
[01:02.34]Am I missing my cue?
[01:05.72]Anyway.
[01:08.57]Yes.
[01:09.65]Yes, yes.
[01:16.21]Anyways, today we are going to do something that I've been talking about for a while.
[01:20.89]We're going to do the community activities.
[01:30.22]Dot to dots.
[01:31.58]Spot the differences.
[01:33.60]Where's Waldo?
[01:34.96]Except it's me.
[01:37.80]Funny stories that the community has written.
[01:41.38]And then some, right?
[01:43.84]Now, I have a lot of these.
[01:48.33]There are, I believe, 45 dot-to-dot activities.
[01:55.17]I think there are 10 Where's Waldo's.
[01:58.02]I think there are 10 Spot the Difference activities.
[02:02.70]And there are about 200-300 stories and jokes.
[02:07.29]So I don't think we're gonna be able to get through all of those today because I have to I have to Get on an airplane This is the last stream you're going to see from me until The carnival This is gonna be just a chill relaxing.
[02:30.92]Hey everybody.

[03:04.63]It's really not even that big of a deal.
[03:07.13]Considering... Like, guys, I've taken... I've taken, like, four or five days off in a row.
[03:13.67]Just, like, randomly before.
[03:15.13]So I'm acting like, oh, it's the last time you're gonna see me in four days!
[03:19.47]I took, like, a full week off.
[03:21.11]Like, two months ago.
[03:22.93]What am I talking about?
[03:31.46]It's all good.
[03:33.32]Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce to you the first segment of our stream this afternoon.
[03:38.75]Let me, uh... Let me actually get on camera for the first time in a long time.
[03:44.45]And I actually, like, took a shower today.
[03:46.03]So...
[04:01.64]Hey!
[04:03.10]He looks fresh!
[04:03.66]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[04:06.04]I actually did get a haircut.
[04:07.36]Pretty recently, so... He's got a greasy forehead.
[04:15.39]I have oily combination skin, so... Good.
[04:19.09]Yeah, you and my doctor have something in common.
[04:21.17]You both know that.
[04:21.99]Great.

[04:24.07]Oh, it's... It's Otto!
[04:25.99]Oh!
[04:30.94]Everybody, okay, let me tell you something.
[04:33.74]Everybody that has a dog, if you do not, over the course of your life, get a mug with your dog on it, I mean, are you, are you really like a true dog owner?
[04:46.79]I'm not sure.
[04:59.06]Look at this shit.
[05:02.64]This is the first one we're gonna do.
[05:07.04]There are a lot of these.
[05:09.10]So if you don't know how a dot to dot works, what could this be?
[05:13.88]Yeah, I know.
[05:14.80]Dot to dot is you have to start at one with your finger on the, with the pencil, right?
[05:20.92]And you gotta go, for instance, I'm not gonna be zoomed in for these because that's cheating.
[05:25.79]So you go one, two, to three, to four, to five.
[05:28.39]You guys know how to do this.
[05:29.69]It's very self-explanatory.
[05:32.66]I've got an application here that is a really, really neat thing.
[05:36.82]I can draw all over the screen.
[05:39.12]I can draw whatever I want.
[05:41.22]See what I mean?
[05:42.90]And this is not on my computer.
[05:45.12]This is a virtual machine.
[05:46.70]This is a virtual painting machine.
[05:51.14]I can clear it.
[05:52.60]I can save it.
[05:54.16]It's pretty good technology.
[05:56.54]I fucked it up.
[05:57.48]No, I just told you that I have a virtual painting technology thing.
[06:02.97]I could go like this!
[06:04.91]He ruined it.
[06:11.01]What did you say?
[06:12.01]Microsoft Paint?
[06:13.09]No, this isn't Microsoft Paint.
[06:16.84]I don't remember what this application is called, but it's... Actually, yes I do.
[06:22.58]I only know what this thing is called because it has this name.
[06:26.22]I believe this application is called... Epic Pen.
[06:33.92]I think that is, that's actually what this is called.
[06:35.94]Alright, so let's get started.
[06:38.07]I think enough people have trickled in now.
[06:39.47]People know this is going on.
[06:43.35]It's a smart board.
[06:44.21]No, it's an epic pen.
[06:48.61]So let's go with the pencil.
[06:50.11]And we already know what this one is.
[06:52.08]I mean, come on, give me a break.
[06:54.56]See, I'm going to fuck these up.
[06:58.16]Be aware of that.
[06:59.98]I will screw at least half of these up.
[07:03.88]I go down here.
[07:05.02]One, two, three... Four... Five... Six, seven... Ooh, it's getting tricky down here!
[07:15.99]Here comes a jump scare!

[08:06.51]Don't go that way.
[08:07.11]24, 20.
[08:07.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[08:10.77]Is this a trick?
[08:21.72]No, it's not a trick.
[08:22.44]This is the fire.
[08:25.26]This is the fire.
[08:26.36]Right.
[08:26.92]Okay, this is the fire.
[08:29.64]That was cool.
[08:30.84]Alright, cool.
[08:32.07]Nice work.
[08:34.71]26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
[08:34.87]And we go up where it gets the flame.
[08:36.41]31, 32, 33, 34, 35.
[08:36.51]All the way up here.
[08:38.33]Here.
[08:38.45]This is pretty good.
[08:39.55]41, 42.
[09:05.49]And wrap it across to 53.
[09:09.95]First one is done.
[09:11.96]Look at how happy he looks.
[09:16.44]Very very good.
[09:18.28]That one was easy.
[09:20.22]Yeah, um, I, let me tell you, let me, oh, let me tell you.
[09:23.72]Jerma starts at half of the sentences, but let me tell you.
[09:25.86]Let me tell you something.
[09:26.56]Let me tell you.
[09:27.78]Um, somebody, some of you guys decided to, I guess, be funny.
[09:34.06]And there were a bunch of these in here that were just, like, triangles.
[09:36.44]Just, like, one, two, three.
[09:38.72]And, like, a square.
[09:40.70]Like, that ain't, that ain't gonna show up on stream.
[09:43.00]So.
[09:47.41]There's the first one.
[09:47.99]That's Fireman.
[09:50.42]While I do this, I'm going to put on some stories.
[09:55.72]We've got to get the first one done.
[09:57.20]I've got to show you how it works.
[09:59.18]So I'm going to put on some stories now.
[10:02.97]These are the stories that people have written.
[10:04.31]And yes, when I say I'm putting on the stories, I'm literally going to have text-to-speech save them to me.
[10:17.17]Because I've got to concentrate on this shit.
[10:21.05]Here we go.
[10:29.44]Okay.
[10:30.30]I was walking down the street the other day and noticed something weird on the sidewalk.
[10:35.62]Something weird on the sidewalk.
[10:36.64]It looked like nothing I had ever seen before.
[10:39.84]As I got closer, I could feel something emitting from it.
[10:43.68]I grabbed the handle and pulled as hard as I could and a burnt crisp of a man fell out.
[10:49.43]Thank you good lady, he said.
[10:51.49]I have been locked inside that walk-in oven for days.
[10:56.24]He then faceplanted so hard that he turned to dust and disappeared.
[11:00.12]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[11:01.28]I haven't seen him since.
[11:03.36]Elizabeth L. From Stockholm, Sweden.
[11:07.19]Closing square bracket.
[11:09.09]I saw Jerma at a grocery store in Boston yesterday.
[11:13.33]I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
[11:21.10]oh he said oh like you're doing now right closing square bracket back when army of two first came out me and my college roommates sweet mates were all way too into halo three to really fireman again I didn't even think army of two was on my radar in 2008.
[11:40.66]My college suitemates would sneak into my room while I wasn't there and play Halo 3 without my permission on my Xbox.
[11:48.54]But more importantly, they would look at my DVD collection.
[11:53.16]I had like 215 DVDs in alphabetical order and they would pay a fee where they would move to random titles in different places and see how long it would take me to notice.
[12:06.78]Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me than it does about them, but I could tell every time that was the joke.
[12:13.95]I would just scan briefly over my DVDs every day and see if they had taken one was usually the issue wasn't I wasn't checking to see if they put them out of order.
[12:23.00]I was checking because they would turn up missing.
[12:25.58]And then I would track them down and find someone across the hallway who borrowed one without asking and what do you know?
[12:34.22]The DVD is missing from inside of its jewel case.
[12:38.60]Where did it go?
[12:39.56]No one knows.
[12:41.78]Oh, I found it.
[12:42.62]It's in two pieces now.
[12:45.00]No, I'm not still angry about that.
[12:47.47]Is this still part of the- Closing square bracket.
[12:49.21]No, closing square bracket.
[12:50.21]There was once a man at an airport without a passport.
[12:53.85]He was making a sound like a snort, unable to retort.
[12:58.01]Good.
[12:58.35]As a last resort, he tried to act like an athlete for a sport.
[13:03.19]He landed in a court, which to him was like a resort.
[13:07.46]Taking public transport, he went to a port.
[13:10.82]For his to port, his height was listed, which, by all accounts, was short.
[13:15.78]Closing square bracket.
[13:18.12]One time at a friend's house, I was hungry and looted his pants for something to eat.
[13:22.87]How do you speak with a TTS frame?
[13:24.61]I can't talk!
[13:26.09]This person's streaming for me!
[13:29.19]Bear in mind two factors.
[13:31.49]The robot is streaming for me.
[13:33.69]I can't even talk to you guys.
[13:39.34]Hey!
[13:44.44]What's up?
[13:46.50]One time at a friend's house, I was hungry and looted his pantry for something to eat.
[13:52.20]I found a jar of what I had assumed to be hummus and attempted to open it.
[13:56.43]Oh, you never do a mystery rumus.
[13:57.51]Bear in mind two factors.
[13:59.15]I had a brand new shirt on and the lid on the jar still had the sealing plastic on it.
[14:04.84]I use my shirt as a way to get extra grip against the protest of my friends, one of which who says, you're going to spill the oil on the top all over your new shirt, to which I replied, no, the plastic is still on it, it's okay.
[14:18.67]Immediately after this, the lid slid off and I spilled oil all over my shirt.
[14:24.40]My next genius plan was to eat an entire spoonful of the hummus, which I did.
[14:29.24]That's not that bad.
[14:30.57]Only after realizing that the hummus in my mouth was possibly the worst thing I have ever tasted, I finally realized that the substance in the jar was in fact raw garbanzo bean paste.
[14:41.66]What?
[14:42.65]I ran to the sink and attempted to spit out the glob now forming into a paste in my mouth only to realize to my horror that the paste had stuck to every inch of my mouth between my teeth, under my tongue, and on the ridges on the roof of my mouth.
[14:56.52]I can't do these.
[14:57.92]In desperation, I attempted to turn the sink on to wash my mouth out and pulled up on what I believe to be the sink's handle only for the handle to come off.
[15:06.94]What?
[15:07.18]Where are you?
[15:07.80]Is this a Home Alone house?
[15:08.98]It was a soap dispenser.
[15:13.07]Hold on, I gotta turn these off.
[15:16.59]Are you sure, was like Macaulay Culkin fucking walking around?
[15:19.71]Did you like, in your peripheral, was like a little kid running up the stairs going like, and like having paint cans behind him?
[15:28.80]Okay, hold, I need to, I need a break from, I gotta take a break, because I only did one of these.
[15:39.78]I can't even pay attention.
[15:43.12]It's been like two minutes.
[15:44.36]Has it?
[15:45.82]It has been.
[15:46.18]It's been like 15.
[15:47.18]It's been 16 minutes.
[15:50.54]Alright, well there's Fireman.
[15:51.34]There's another Fireman.
[15:52.04]Looks good.
[15:54.82]Very cool.
[15:56.14]That one's... That one's... That was less interpretation.
[15:58.30]That's more of like a true emote right there.
[16:00.84]Looks good.
[16:07.94]No, I don't want to do that.
[16:11.22]It's Fireman!
[16:19.90]Alright, here comes another one.
[16:22.91]I have to do these individually, guys.
[16:29.88]This is called Cheerio Land.
[16:34.78]Wait, what happened to my audio?
[16:40.12]There is a land called Cheerio Land, populated entirely by Cheerios.
[16:45.42]All of the different Cheerios live in a caste system, with the Honey Nut Cheerios in the leader class, the Chocolate Cheerios acting as the lords and nobles, the Frosted Cheerios being the somewhat well-off peasants, and the Normal Cheerios as the poor and destitute.
[17:00.87]One day, a Normal Cheerio fell in love with a Honey Nut Cheerio, but the only way he could see her was if he eventually became a Honey Nut Cheerio himself.
[17:10.72]He goes to the Cheerio Wizard, who is the only person capable of upgrading Cheerios to the next level.
[17:18.18]After working hard for years under the supervision of the Cheerio Wizard, he is eventually upgraded to a Frosted Cheerio, a Chocolate Cheerio, and finally becomes a Honey Nut Cheerio.
[17:30.14]He meets the love of his life at last, and together they celebrate by going to a nearby fair.
[17:36.34]After a few hours, they get thirsty and they go to get some fruit punch.
[17:41.97]However, they had to wait in a long line for lemonade because there was no punchline.
[17:50.33]What?
[17:50.63]I fucked that whole thing up, didn't I?
[17:52.14]Hold on.
[17:54.88]There's no punchline.
[17:56.88]You don't write a whole story like that, man, and not have a punchline.
[18:01.18]13, oh, because I went the other way, right?
[18:02.92]Sorry, I was listening to the Cheerio hierarchy system.
[18:08.62]I was having trouble paying attention.
[18:09.98]There we go, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 is down here.
[18:14.91]What's going on here?
[18:15.49]So we go 50.
[18:26.16]Oh, these are the sneakers.
[18:27.86]I see.
[18:28.76]Okay.
[18:29.44]You got me on this one.
[18:30.40]Hey, you got me.
[18:31.28]Nice work.
[18:34.80]59.
[18:41.31]51.
[18:41.33]56, 67.
[18:41.87]There it is.
[18:43.37]Another fireman.
[18:46.33]He wears sneakers?
[18:47.31]Oh, well.
[18:47.95]No, well, these things.
[18:49.49]His legs.
[18:51.85]Story time.
[18:52.67]Now.
[18:52.91]Hold on.
[18:54.77]We've got plenty of time, so don't worry.
[19:00.01]Story.
[19:00.55]Now.
[19:01.01]Story.
[19:01.51]Now.
[19:01.89]Story.
[19:02.33]Now.
[19:09.61]Alright.
[19:10.53]I'll give you two stories in a row.
[19:13.22]Okay?
[19:13.46]How does that sound?
[19:18.38]Hopefully these were vetted.
[19:30.90]Okay.
[19:35.92]Two stories back to back, next image.
[19:38.56]There used to be a boy who always jumped over the fence.
[19:42.80]His father told him not to jump over the fence because every time he jumped over the fence, he broke a little bit of it.
[19:49.49]Not to say that he was worried about his son.
[19:52.99]But the boy didn't listen and still jumped over and over.
[19:56.86]Displeased and worried, the father broke the fence down and built a gate on the place where once the fence was standing.
[20:04.51]Yet the boy still jumped over the gate, even though he could easily open it.
[20:09.56]So, the father left the gate open all the time and all kind of strangers traveled trough the open gate and thanked the father for the easy passage and the father wondered, did the boy did that on purpose?
[20:21.81]In the evening, he asked his son why he jumped over the fence and Gatom the son replied with a very simple response, I jumped over the fence to prove myself that I'm not 5'3", and actually big enough to jump over.
[20:35.99]Suddenly the father jumped up and started to make painful noises and he was not able to control his flatulence anymore while shouting at his son, son I pay for your Twitch prime, so you better support that streamer.
[20:49.95]Exclamation mark.
[20:51.85]And then something.
[20:53.36]Tell me a sad story.
[20:55.28]Where is the joy in the life that you have lived?
[20:58.46]And then he began to play a recording.
[21:01.34]He started with me, then it was Paul, and then it was myself.
[21:06.32]It was great.
[21:07.86]And then it was all of us.
[21:10.00]It made me think, why is that so tragic?
[21:13.29]And I thought, well, if they want you to find joy in death, we can do that.
[21:18.89]But we could not find joy in what we did.
[21:22.05]And we didn't.
[21:23.46]Why didn't we find happiness in the moment?
[21:26.92]Then I remember going to the doctor, and talking to a psychiatrist.
[21:32.10]This doctor comes in and says, this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
[21:37.72]I said, it's just sad.
[21:39.94]She said, there is nothing beautiful about what you're saying.
[21:44.65]And then she said, it's just something that must be given.
[21:47.96]It has to be given willingly.
[21:50.30]What the fuck is this story?
[21:51.18]I heard myself thinking that.
[21:52.94]It was so difficult to find that.
[21:55.54]She talked to me for three hours and told me that if you don't choose the path of joy, death won't have any meaning for you.
[22:03.67]And then she said, you'll be happy.
[22:06.31]You have always loved life the way it's meant to be lived and to come to terms with death and what it is.
[22:15.74]That's that one.
[22:16.52]Alright, nice.
[22:17.10]Alright, it's my turn to stream now.
[22:20.60]Thank you.
[22:21.70]We go back and forth here.
[22:23.95]So this looks like jermaVenus.
[22:28.39]What do you mean no?
[22:29.87]That's too bad.
[22:30.57]We're sharing time here.
[22:33.11]This is definitely jermaVenus.
[22:36.03]I don't know what I did wrong with the eye though.
[22:37.47]I think I fucked up the eye.
[22:38.63]The yellow wasn't coming out that well.
[22:45.21]This is the mouth.
[22:49.33]Where's 60?
[22:50.49]60's over here.
[22:50.93]I might have to do smaller, a little smaller on the inside here.
[22:59.58]Use white?
[23:03.18]How do I use white on a white background?
[23:06.40]That's just what my eye looks like.
[23:09.14]My eye doesn't look like that.
[23:10.20]61.
[23:11.24]I might have to go a tier lower for this.
[23:16.31]Yeah, we'll go on a tier lower.
[23:18.49]A finer line here.
[23:20.13]62.
[23:20.15]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[23:21.77]With 69 in here.
[23:24.37]69, 70.
[23:25.05]This looks fucked up.
[23:41.83]73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80.
[23:41.99]It's coming together.
[23:42.67]81, 82, all the way up.
[23:43.13]87, 88.
[23:43.45]Alright.
[23:43.69]That actually doesn't look that bad.
[23:45.15]That looks pretty good.

[25:16.11]I have to keep, I have to finish it.
[25:17.18]Hold on.
[25:21.00]102, 103.
[25:22.12]All the way around.
[25:25.74]Down here.
[25:26.66]And then pull it back.
[25:31.66]Up here.
[25:32.22]18, 19, 120.
[25:32.28]121. 25.
[25:44.17]25, 26, 27.
[25:44.23]It's 20 all the way around.
[25:45.91]It's another circle.
[25:50.34]28, 29, 30, 31, 32.
[25:50.48]All the way around here.
[25:51.24]Where's 35?
[25:51.42]36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
[26:13.07]Hold on.
[26:13.51]Let's clean it up a little bit.
[26:17.84]Let me get a little bit bigger.
[26:19.44]Let me see if I can get in here and just clean it up.
[26:22.36]This doesn't look right to me.
[26:26.34]That's supposed to be the nose.
[26:27.40]Did I go backwards?
[26:39.77]There it is.
[26:42.01]Let me see if I go like this.
[27:06.83]Yeah, no, it works.
[27:10.17]Very good.
[27:11.54]Hey, what do you say we get a couple more stories?
[27:14.52]You guys like those?
[27:15.70]Those jermaVenus?
[27:19.38]Don't curve lines?
[27:20.84]Well, I didn't... Look.
[27:23.52]See?
[27:23.86]Like, I... I wasn't, like, curving.
[27:27.40]I was following it.
[27:28.27]Up here, I mean, you have to curve.
[27:29.41]Otherwise, what are you gonna... I wasn't curving.
[27:35.15]Alright, let's get another story on here.
[27:40.29]I'll do three this time.
[27:55.48]I just, like, saw the... You guys.
[27:58.29]I just literally... Okay.
[28:00.15]These ones are long.
[28:01.03]This is a long-ass story.
[28:04.92]The next two are, like, long-ass stories.
[28:17.53]I don't know.
[28:18.69]All I saw was the last word here.
[28:20.77]This might be a spoiler for Infinity War.
[28:23.77]If you haven't seen Infinity War, you're going to have to leave.
[28:27.66]You're going to have to leave now.
[28:29.12]This might be an Infinity War Marvel spoiler.
[28:32.26]I just saw a word.
[28:36.36]Or just hurry up and go watch the movie now.
[28:39.80]Just go watch one of those YouTube videos where they explain the whole story in like four minutes.
[28:43.72]That's how long it's going to take to get there.
[28:49.33]Alright, we'll do that one too.
[29:08.80]OK, here we go.
[29:09.66]Next, please.
[29:15.00]No, I want to introduce the next one.
[29:16.16]We're not going to have to get blown out by the other streamer who's more popular than I am.
[29:20.93]That's the problem.
[29:21.91]The TTS guy is more popular than me right now.
[29:24.75]And I'm not okay with that.
[29:26.41]I'm having trouble with that.
[29:39.25]Okay, so this one.
[29:43.33]Alright, yeah, I'll put on the popular guy.
[29:52.05]Hey guys, I had the circus come to my town last week and I had a lot of fun.
[29:57.05]Cool.
[29:58.00]The main attraction was called the short streamer and my goodness I never laughed so hard.
[30:04.40]The crowd kept chanting play TF2 at him and he was very angry.
[30:09.79]I felt so bad for him I bought him a drive pepper after the show, and he said that it was the nicest thing anyone ever did for him, and I felt so good about myself.
[30:20.88]About the month later the short streamer wrote to me, saying he got into a fight with someone named grillmasticsbbq, and needed bits for the hospital bill.
[30:31.05]I wrote back and said I couldn't help him but I wished him luck.
[30:35.53]The next week, someone who looked like he was made of glue and wearing a cape stood outside of my door.
[30:42.50]I had to flee the state, because I feared for my life, and hitched a balloon ride to Las Vegas.
[30:49.24]Turns out the short streamer was also on this balloon with me, and we had an epic fight, which ended with me throwing him off over the desert.
[30:58.19]I don't know where the short streamer or the glue man are, but if you see anyone who looks like that, please report him to the authorities.
[31:06.79]Closing square bracket.
[31:08.67]Lights began to shine through the vent grate.
[31:12.13]A faint light that could remind anyone of a comfy Boston basement.
[31:16.56]What the fuck is this?
[31:17.46]Tim began to lightly step across the ventilation tunnel, his tired legs skittering on the steel as he almost escaped.
[31:23.94]This is so complicated.
[31:25.62]Freedom at last, Tim thought.
[31:28.30]Years of living in the vent of Jerma's cave, he was finally in the home stretch.
[31:33.78]As he approached the vent, he could hear the faint streamer in the chasms below.
[31:39.20]He couldn't entirely make him out, but he could hear something about dieting.
[31:44.35]It didn't matter to him.
[31:46.15]All that mattered was freedom from the dwarven dungeon.
[31:49.77]His eyes peered through the vent, and across the room he found his destination.
[31:54.66]the door on the other side of the room.
[31:57.26]That must be it, he thought.
[31:59.84]Once he would be able to make it across, he would most likely find the hallways of the gamer king he was always told about.
[32:07.28]It would lead him to the world of outside.
[32:10.13]He couldn't dream of success yet, he still needed to fly across the chaotic pit the human dwarf hybrid resided.
[32:18.19]Tim could even see his followers on one of the monitors, spamming a subtraction by two for some reason.
[32:25.21]Tim wasted no time.
[32:27.31]He flew through the vent and onto the nearest surface he could find.
[32:32.03]He began to shake, as this was the final moment where it all mattered.
[32:37.01]What?
[32:37.27]Freedom from years of torment of living in Jerma's gamer cave.
[32:40.93]Why's everybody- No more.
[32:42.71]Snap.
[32:43.88]Closing square bracket.
[32:45.88]So, one day a church was looking for a replacement- Why's everybody my- What did I do?
[32:52.32]Oh, the story.
[32:55.26]It's the sto- okay, I was like, what happened?
[32:57.26]I'm just like, drawing, what did I do?
[33:01.40]Oh, that was the word!
[33:02.72]I know it was in the sto- I'm just a fucking idiot.
[33:11.51]There we go, here comes the next story.
[33:15.97]So, one day a church was looking for a replacement for the guy they had to climb the tower every hour and ring the huge church bell.
[33:24.82]None of applicants were strong enough to do it.
[33:28.08]Well, finally one day a man with no arms came up to apply for the job.
[33:33.88]The priest said, but how can you ring it with no arms?
[33:38.04]And the man took a few steps back and ran head first into the bell, getting it to ring.
[33:43.83]He got the job.
[33:45.09]He did his job well, and was on time every hour.
[33:49.31]Until one day after so many blows to the head, when he reared back and ran, he missed and went straight off the tower.
[33:56.69]As people started to gather around him on the ground, frantic, the woman asked the man beside her, does anyone know who this is?
[34:05.30]The man replied, I don't know, but his face rings a bell.
[34:10.70]What?
[34:12.44]What did I do?
[34:13.00]I fucked up something over here.
[34:14.28]What did I do over here?
[34:19.83]What happened over here?
[34:21.77]No, I did this right.
[34:26.83]Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, this is correct.
[34:29.29]This is actually correct.
[34:31.39]This is an earbud.
[34:34.72]Wow.
[34:35.40]That's detail.
[34:36.12]Alright.
[34:37.52]Where's 51?
[34:37.72]51.
[34:37.76]I don't see 51.
[34:38.20]50, 51.
[34:41.20]Where's 51?
[34:41.56]Everybody see 51?
[34:51.54]I see 52.
[34:51.96]51.
[34:52.02]There it is.
[34:55.33]Well, those are two excellent stories.
[34:59.43]Excellent stories, I guess.
[35:07.40]55.
[35:07.76]56.
[35:08.18]Am I wearing a monocle?
[35:09.44]58.
[35:11.82]That was three stories.
[35:16.32]59. 60.
[35:23.28]Okay.
[35:23.64]61, 62, 63, 64.
[35:27.26]67, 68, 69, 70.
[35:27.34]Oh, fuck.
[35:27.57]I screwed it up.
[35:28.31]No, I didn't.
[35:28.87]71. 72.
[35:52.78]73.
[35:52.96]Up here.
[35:53.68]74, 75, 76.
[35:53.74]79.
[36:00.00]Is it my nose?
[36:00.48]80.
[36:00.50]81.
[36:00.52]Oh my god.
[36:00.84]82.
[36:00.86]83. 83.
[36:26.73]I know what this is.
[36:28.45]I know what this is.
[36:31.19]This is the... that thing.
[36:35.57]I already know it.
[36:39.55]I was wondering why this looked so fucked up.
[36:40.99]87... 88... 89... 90...
[36:53.05]91, 92.
[36:54.47]Look at how tight these are.
[36:55.31]93.
[36:55.33]Where's 94?
[36:55.55]Where's, there's 84.
[36:56.75]93.
[37:03.01]Oh, it's right here.
[37:03.55]94. 95.
[37:32.07]100.
[37:32.09]101.
[37:32.11]102.
[37:32.13]103.
[37:32.15]Oh, it's coming together!
[37:34.05]I can see it!
[37:34.53]104.
[37:34.55]107 is right in the middle here.
[37:36.77]And then 108.
[37:37.49]9. 10.
[38:05.55]This is fucking scary.
[38:08.66]It was 12... Right below.
[38:15.10]12... Back up to 13?
[38:31.87]Where is the dot in 18?
[38:33.15]18.
[38:33.17]Down.
[38:33.27]120.
[38:33.29]121.
[38:33.31]I look a fucking hundred years old.
[39:03.73]125, 126, 127, 128.
[39:03.91]That's wrong?
[39:05.15]What do you mean that's wrong?
[39:09.29]No, it's not.
[39:09.67]I missed 120?
[39:10.23]No, I didn't, did I?
[39:34.96]Oh fuck, I can't do that.
[39:39.93]Wait, let me just see where they are.
[39:43.37]Okay.
[39:46.95]Nah, I'm using Epic Pen, okay?
[39:49.79]That's not, what do you mean cheating?
[39:51.03]Everyone just told me to zoom in.
[39:51.87]Alright, 117, 118.
[39:52.07]119, 120.
[39:54.43]I got 120 last time.
[40:10.01]122, 123, 4... Oh, it has fucking 5.
[40:11.25]125.
[40:11.33]Is that it right there?
[40:15.44]Is that 125?
[40:16.58]I think so, right?
[40:17.98]Right, okay, right there.
[40:19.44]26.
[40:19.46]127. 128.
[40:56.33]Those of you that are wondering if this just looks fucking horrible, you always have to remember, this image looks worse than this.
[41:10.04]The actual source image looks worse than this.
[41:13.10]So give me a break here.
[41:15.92]This is not about bad line work.
[41:20.31]You want us looking at your ear the whole time?
[41:22.55]Fine, I'll sit back like this.
[41:27.44]Yeah, I complained about this already.
[41:29.36]That's the second image when you type in Jerma985 into Google.
[41:32.96]Thanks, guys.
[41:34.46]Really looking forward to, like, getting that fucking TV show.
[41:36.66]33, 34.
[41:42.36]Okay, then this goes up and around.
[41:49.69]Big eyebrow. 44.
[41:58.56]Then... 141?
[42:00.42]142?
[42:00.44]143?
[42:00.62]Is my, like, skin melting?
[42:21.95]45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 2, 3, 4, 5, 56, 57, 58, 59, 160, 161!
[42:23.45]It's done!
[42:23.85]They are.
[42:24.37]Oh, also, I forgot to do this.
[42:27.83]I need a, uh, I just need a white screen.
[42:31.25]Hold on.
[42:50.91]Because after I'm done, I want to just put them on a white screen.
[42:52.95]I don't think I should be able to do that with just... I just need a white... Hold on.
[43:11.59]Let me turn this off for a second.
[43:12.93]I need to find it.
[43:14.11]Where is it?
[43:15.69]No, not this.
[43:16.19]This.
[43:18.55]Give me one second.
[43:20.53]I need to make like a new window.
[43:24.67]Yeah, that's better, okay.
[43:34.91]There we go, just a pure white screen.
[43:37.43]No, I don't want a 24 hour video of a white screen.
[43:42.63]Why the fuck does that exist?
[43:43.81]I just want a white background.
[43:47.09]24 hours of white screen.
[43:50.31]Ten hours of incredible widescreen!
[43:53.81]I just want a fucking wallpaper!
[44:00.87]Okay, that's... That's good.
[44:06.64]Why?
[44:09.58]Alright, so... Uh, that's good.
[44:14.06]I'm just gonna go like this.
[44:19.20]And I can hide it.
[44:19.86]So here we go.
[44:21.12]You ready?
[44:21.46]Are you ready to see?
[44:24.08]Here is what we're looking at now.
[44:41.15]I think it actually looks pretty good.
[44:45.93]Good Lord, the tabs.
[44:48.03]Welcome to the rest of your life on this string.
[44:52.05]You look like Ron Swanson.
[45:02.36]No, I can just do that.
[45:03.24]Alright, let's keep going.
[45:06.42]Let's get a couple of stories.
[45:17.72]Okay.
[45:18.80]We'll do three stories this time.
[45:20.86]This is just a warm-up, guys.
[45:25.99]Just wait till we get to the Where's Waldo.
[45:29.23]Using Add Block Plus instead of U-Block Origin.
[45:34.03]I don't fucking know.
[45:44.45]Guys, I only use Adblock for the websites that take over your whole computer.
[45:50.59]You know what I'm saying?
[45:52.73]I only use Adblock for the websites that have a whole, like, they go like this.
[45:58.66]You open up the webpage, and then you see a banner ad, and you're like, okay, whatever, I don't care.
[46:02.66]And then that banner ad scrolls down with you and takes over the whole page.
[46:06.62]It's another page on top of the page.
[46:09.48]I don't know why people think that it's a good idea.
[46:12.06]It is the fucking dumbest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[46:15.02]It's like... It's like if you went to like CVS, right?
[46:17.98]You were walking into CVS and somebody was just standing in front of you screaming in your face.
[46:24.10]And they're going like this and they're getting in your fucking way and blocking you and screaming in your face.
[46:27.70]It's like, look, I just want to go into the CVS, okay?
[46:31.49]I don't care.
[46:31.91]You stand over there and you scream, okay?
[46:34.05]Stand to the side of the door and fucking yell in my face.
[46:36.97]Like from like eight feet away.
[46:39.82]Hey!
[46:41.30]Hey!
[46:41.76]Alright, that guy's, I gotta get past that guy.
[46:44.66]Don't put it right here.
[46:45.52]Don't make me move and you're just on my fucking body.
[46:49.74]Stand like over there and scream at me while I'm going into the CVS.
[46:54.71]If I see a website that does that, it immediately goes on my shit list.
[47:03.14]Why do I use a CVS as a store example every time?
[47:05.98]Because it's CVS every 15 feet.
[47:16.89]There's a CVS literally every fucking like 10 feet in America.
[47:21.32]Show us your search history.
[47:26.60]No, I'm not going to show you my fucking search history.
[47:30.53]Do you know why that is?
[47:31.53]It has nothing to do with... Wait a minute.
[47:34.87]We might see his pornography.
[47:39.01]No, I got like bank information in here.
[47:43.28]Oh, let me hit P!
[47:44.08]Ho ho ho!
[47:45.10]No, that's all my bank accounts.
[47:48.02]Oh.
[47:48.78]That was funny, Jibade had got him.
[47:59.91]He's scared.
[48:02.55]I don't want you to know what I... I may have typed in a restaurant that's down the street.
[48:08.32]Like... Oh!
[48:10.34]Whoops!
[48:11.98]Nah, you ain't getting shit.
[48:13.42]Uh-uh.
[48:16.24]That ain't fucking happening.
[48:20.80]This is all you get.
[48:22.04]All you get.
[48:22.38]You can just imagine what all those tabs are.
[48:25.44]Show us every tab.
[48:26.51]Yeah, you can just imagine what's on there, huh?
[48:30.45]In fact, I'll show you the next one.
[48:32.89]Alright, let's go.
[48:33.39]Alright, I got stories to tell.
[48:34.73]The bear guards?
[48:54.40]What the fuck is this one?
[48:58.16]This is so long.
[49:04.80]Oh my god.
[49:05.72]Okay, we're just doing two, because this one is like three minutes long, at least.
[49:11.42]Hey, you guys relaxed yet?
[49:17.73]Here we go.
[49:21.61]Don't you wish you could see those fucking tabs?
[49:23.25]Man, I wish we could see those fucking tabs!
[49:29.86]I'll zoom in for this one, because it can fit.
[49:48.82]A man stands in a room of glass.
[49:50.90]In front of him is a table with a bowl.
[49:53.96]Inside the bowl is a berry.
[49:56.18]Surrounding the room people scream and shout.
[49:59.34]Some yell, eat the berry.
[50:01.48]While others yell, don't eat the berry.
[50:04.16]It's poisoned.
[50:05.42]The man looks around the room and sees the berry.
[50:08.76]He places a fork under the berry and chews on it.
[50:12.21]The man places another fork under the berry and chews again.
[50:16.59]At this point, the man realizes he has eaten poison, thus giving a death sentence to anyone trying to make it through the maze.
[50:24.45]What?
[50:24.77]He runs through the maze until he is outside a cave surrounded by many poisonous berries.
[50:31.15]Suddenly, the man collapses on his back, screaming.
[50:35.03]At this point, all eyes are on the man.
[50:37.73]His eyes are full of poison and he wants to escape, however he is surrounded by hundreds of berry hunters.
[50:44.88]Some of them fight, some just sit there, waiting the turn to fight.
[50:49.80]Eventually, the man breaks free and takes off.
[50:52.90]The man takes off with all of the other bears and they run after him, as all the berry hunters turn towards the man and laugh at how pathetic he is.
[51:01.77]The man tries to flee, but before he can do so, the bear guards arrive and shackle him.
[51:07.83]They take him back to the room he was in originally, and place another berry down on the table.
[51:13.89]They then leave and the cycle starts again.
[51:17.13]Written by Etruscara and talked to Transformer from Yahoo California.
[51:21.53]I had a dream that there was a four-person swimming pool.
[51:25.27]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[51:26.97]Hold on a second there.
[51:28.65]Slow down.
[51:29.17]There's a rat.
[51:36.12]The bear guards the poison coming out of his eyes, I think is my favorite.
[51:41.22]That's a giant rat, that's correct.
[51:44.33]I think I can just go like this, and you guys should be able just to see.
[51:46.81]Woo-hoo!
[51:48.83]Look at that.
[51:49.11]Let me make it a little bigger to match.
[51:55.54]Look at that.
[52:00.48]I need to finish it, though, don't I?
[52:01.80]See?
[52:09.99]That's cute.
[52:13.11]Very nice.
[52:13.51]Thank you.
[52:17.41]Now let's zoom this back out and do the next one.
[52:24.18]Clear it, and I'll get the next stories coming, don't worry.
[52:27.38]California.
[52:28.36]Closing square bracket.
[52:30.38]I had a dream that there was a four-person swimming pool battle royale where you eliminate people by either beating them unconscious in the pool or knocking them out of the pool.
[52:40.94]After numerous failures against children, I knew that I needed to step up my game.
[52:45.60]I put on a snorkel and immediately became a god at the game.
[52:50.84]Soon enough, I made it to the big leagues.
[52:53.72]My competition was Gia Gio, Big Gio, with Spider-Man powers and a lime with Spider-Man powers.
[53:01.15]The first of three matches begun, and I got destroyed without my snorkel.
[53:06.87]Gio subdued me while Gia Cho bashed my ribcage in.
[53:11.13]I put on nose and eye goggles after the round and I made a full rebound.
[53:16.51]Gio and the lime watched in horror from the ceiling as I pummeled Giaccio.
[53:21.73]I snatched the lime from the ceiling and drowned him, eliminating him.
[53:26.31]Gio was a different story.
[53:28.56]Approaching him was too risky to do head on.
[53:31.64]While I was catching my breath he managed to pin my arm to the poolside.
[53:36.73]I began to panic, but opportunity struck.
[53:39.83]The Lime's dead body floated near me, and as Geo delivered another webshot, I threw the Lime at Geo.
[53:46.57]The collision was enough to send Geo into his second phase.
[53:48.73]I'm not gonna spend time on this one, okay?
[53:51.34]This is not a mystery.
[53:52.58]I was able to defeat Geo.
[53:54.04]This is not a fucking mystery.
[53:55.58]After this match, everyone forfeited except for me due to rain, and I won $7,000.
[54:03.75]Wait, how do you go from 106 to 107 here?
[54:05.83]106, 107?
[54:05.99]108, 109?
[54:31.12]126?
[54:31.24]Where's 127?
[54:33.00]There's 120.
[54:36.52]It's like in here somewhere.
[54:56.34]What the fuck is happening?
[54:57.66]Hold on.
[54:58.52]Go back.
[55:03.85]What the fuck is happening?
[55:04.89]43.
[55:04.91]47.
[55:06.99]All the way up here.
[55:09.65]57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67.
[55:09.93]70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80.
[55:10.33]I got like an itchy ass eye.
[55:30.05]86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93.
[55:36.77]All the way down here, through here, to 106.
[55:42.75]And then I have to go all the way across to here.
[55:51.72]Don't connect them.
[55:56.66]Well, this is dot, the dot, connect the dots.
[56:11.87]Holy shit, I like stopped paying attention.
[56:14.07]Wait, go back.
[56:16.23]Yeah, you have to connect the dots.
[56:17.31]108, 109, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[56:18.55]Oh, this is an ear stream.
[56:20.03]I forgot I have to lean back.
[56:22.57]25, 26, 27.
[56:22.69]28 up here.
[56:46.27]46.
[56:46.29]Alright, this is where I got all fucked up.
[56:47.37]49, 50, 51, 52, 53.
[56:47.51]55 is right here.
[56:47.85]Is it right next to it?
[57:18.96]7, 58, 69, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69.
[57:19.82]What is this?
[57:20.72]Is this my mouth?
[57:21.46]70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77.
[57:21.84]Is that correct?
[57:59.47]That's a dab.
[58:00.37]Yeah.
[58:02.78]That's maybe the yo-yo.
[58:04.22]That's a... Well, that's... There it is.
[58:08.24]There's the dab.
[58:14.28]That's pretty good.
[58:17.64]Okay.
[58:19.24]We gotta get a couple more stories on here.
[58:26.47]I don't know how some of you guys come up with this shit.
[58:32.77]OK, here's this one.
[58:35.39]This is a long one here.
[58:45.11]OK, let's get these on.
[58:46.23]Alright, next dot to dot image is, let's clear it.
[59:06.50]I do have blue, you're right, I got blue.
[59:07.90]What do you mean, you're right?
[59:09.36]Nobody said that, I did.
[59:11.24]Alright, let's go!
[59:19.21]Start at one.
[59:22.45]You gonna play?
[59:22.97]What's going on here?
[59:24.67]Six Flags is the best amusement park.
[59:27.81]It is a park for fun and I think it is pretty amazing.
[59:32.02]When we visited, our park had a really nice view from the park.
[59:36.47]You can see the entire park at your own pace for $5.
[59:40.85]This is a fun, cheap ride.
[59:43.39]For $8, you'll get a ride or two that takes you through the whole park, including a little fun boat ride down the park's pirate ship.
[59:51.52]Oh, that's fun!
[59:52.30]So, you get your ride, some food, and then you go back down in the boat and ride through the fun ride.
[59:59.16]The ride includes the ride itself with the boat, fun ride, a few drinks and some souvenirs.
[60:05.61]it is a great place to hang out with your friends and a great place to visit during the day all in all this place is well worth the seven dollars they have tons of rides I've been looking forward to some of our friends coming there including
[60:21.28]The Great Wall of China.
[60:23.18]The Three Kings.
[60:24.52]King Kong.
[60:25.54]The world's biggest monkey rides.
[60:28.30]All the giant bats.
[60:29.98]Closing square bracket.
[60:31.87]For as long as I can remember, I've always had a fascination with birds.
[60:37.47]I always liked to spot them with big binoculars I borrowed from my parents and write them down in my big blue bird book.
[60:45.49]I would write things like, new, blue feathered sparrow making a nest in the big oak tree, and such.
[60:52.31]I would even put photographs next to it the descriptions sometimes.
[60:57.03]So anyway, it's quite natural then that when I saw a small, red headed woodpecker on the sidewalk I was curious.
[61:04.55]Woodpeckers aren't city birds.
[61:06.85]In fact, I don't think I've ever seen one outside of the woods.
[61:11.61]What was it doing here?
[61:13.21]Was it lost?
[61:14.43]Maybe it was hurt.
[61:16.13]So I sneakily walked up to it, preparing to pick it up and take it home to care for it and release it back into the forest.
[61:23.87]It was just walking across the sidewalk for some reason, not even flying.
[61:29.28]As I came closer though, I could make out its details more and more clearly, and they just didn't make sense.
[61:36.88]This all culminated when I was standing only one or two feet away from the little creature, and it turned around.
[61:44.42]And I teespoke.
[61:52.62]So naturally, I took out my flamethrower and torched that fucker down to the ground.
[61:58.57]I already warned that psychotic little ship never to come within 10 feet of me again after he drilled my previous house to the ground.
[62:07.18]Good riddance.
[62:11.84]What?
[62:12.06]Dude, I know what it feels like now to have TTS on stream.
[62:18.42]You wonder why I don't ever have it on.
[62:20.45]I could not stream.
[62:21.49]I would not be able to.
[62:23.68]I would just sit there and be like, do I go in now?
[62:26.78]Do I go in now?
[62:27.84]Do I say anything now?
[62:30.25]I wouldn't be able to pay attention to anything.
[62:32.95]There would be something on the screen that I'd be reading and I would hear like, and then I went to the bird torch to my face and I'd be like, what the fuck is it?
[62:42.40]I can't pay attention.
[62:43.18]I don't know how some people can do that.
[62:48.57]You have to have lightning focus to have something in one of your ears be going like... So yeah, guys, I went to the supermarket and it was... Wow, what an interesting story I'm going to tell you.
[62:58.29]I got salsa and you just hear that in your ear the whole time.
[63:00.07]I would be like...
[63:21.36]That's, like, un-streamable for me.
[63:26.41]I have ADHD.
[63:32.55]So, let me ask you a question.
[63:35.58]If you were... We're going to do something right now.
[63:37.68]Because I need to prove this.
[63:39.18]I have to prove something sometimes.
[63:40.46]You know what I'm saying?
[63:45.74]Sometimes you just have to prove a point.
[64:29.44]Okay.
[64:30.89]So you and I are going to have a conversation now.
[64:34.11]Okay?
[64:34.51]You and me.
[64:34.97]This is you and me.
[64:35.77]This other person is not part of our conversation.
[64:50.68]Hey, I wanted to go to breakfast with you next week.
[64:54.92]Do you have any time next week?
[64:56.20]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[64:57.84]I was thinking maybe we could go to... Look at me.
[64:59.78]Look at me.
[65:00.72]Maybe... Look at me.
[65:01.48]I don't know.
[65:01.74]McDonald's has a good menu for breakfast, I think.
[65:03.70]That's right.
[65:04.56]Look at me.
[65:05.28]You're not looking... Why are you not looking at me?
[65:07.38]Yeah, no, I think... Hey, one time I shit my pants.
[65:10.32]Well, I've had the doctor's appointment.
[65:11.46]I shit my pants yesterday.
[65:12.84]I have a doctor's appointment.
[65:14.24]I have to go to a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[65:15.76]I shit my pants yesterday.
[65:16.84]Why are you not listening to me?
[65:18.04]Stop!
[65:23.39]Imagine if that happens in real life.
[65:33.77]Stop interrupting the streamer.
[65:40.21]Wait, no, that wasn't supposed to be me.
[65:43.53]This is me talking.
[65:45.17]This is not me.
[65:47.65]This is not me talking.
[65:49.54]I shit my pants yesterday.
[65:51.26]I know, I heard.
[65:51.84]Isn't that funny?
[65:54.11]I shit my pants you- That thing, I'm interrupting the streamer.
[66:01.71]I'm the one on camera!
[66:03.94]Oh my- You get the idea.
[66:05.72]We're gonna move on.
[66:08.98]The idea is, if somebody's talking in your ear and trying to interrupt your conversation, eventually you're gonna be like, I can't hear- I cannot talk to this person about like the McDonald's breakfast menu.
[66:23.34]Who should stream, vote now.
[66:34.75]You, wait a minute, let's call back here to about 20 minutes ago.
[66:39.23]You cannot tell me that you do not like advertisements that take over your fucking screen that make a bunch of noise and then tell me that I'm incorrect with this.
[66:54.66]You cannot say that.
[67:06.70]Oh, that one's out of the fucking park.
[67:10.86]I knocked that one out.
[67:13.35]Anyways, let's continue.
[67:34.37]Hello?
[67:41.85]So naturally.
[67:43.04]Now imagine that's like an ad for the new fucking 2024.
[67:50.18]How quickly are you clicking the X on that screen?
[67:55.45]Just saying.
[67:56.25]Alright.
[67:57.83]Let's go.
[68:07.32]I'm having a fucking blast.
[68:08.76]Alright, let's get a new story.
[68:15.11]I couldn't sleep at all last night.
[68:17.43]Why?
[68:17.63]What happened?
[68:17.93]Lying in bed for what seems to be an hour, as well as getting a little unnerved.
[68:22.30]I can't help but return to my computer and used my time watching past VODs of this Twitch streamer I'm...
[68:29.76]Very familiar with.
[68:31.23]He's a popular streamer yet unfamiliar to some, being he is the top 1000 streamer, but me and him have a sort of history going between us.
[68:40.25]I met this person a long time ago at a Twitch party and we were seemingly getting along I thought.
[68:46.82]I'm still really upset on what he said to me, my name, and to my fans that went to his stream.
[68:53.52]Of course, the past is the past, but somehow his words still affect me to this day.
[68:59.64]I haven't grilled for a long time, mainly through physical issues on my back, and hopefully one day I can return to what I enjoy a lot.
[69:09.02]My therapist is currently helping me through all this and hopefully with enough exercise and healthy foods, I will return streaming again.
[69:17.89]Never really hated you before and after Harrington.
[69:21.59]I see you're quite busy with plans becoming a clown in the circus and chat repeating the words pee-pee-poo-poo.
[69:27.82]But really, I hope our conflict in the past won't affect our relationship now.
[69:33.62]For all you remaining Grilla fans, keep up with my Twitter for more steamy updates.
[69:39.68]XBBQ.
[69:43.29]Grillmaster XBBQ.
[69:44.61]Thank you for that.
[69:45.41]That was a great story.
[69:52.37]Oop, don't fuck it up.
[69:55.05]Speaking of fucking things up, this does not look right to me.
[69:58.97]This looks like a spoon or a fork or something.
[70:03.61]Did I blow this one already?
[70:04.45]52, 53, 54, 55, 56, up here.
[70:21.79]60, alright.
[70:22.23]What is he, like, going for?
[70:23.67]This is not a dab, right?
[70:28.67]Why did I change the thickness?
[70:32.31]Uh, because it's easy.
[70:33.59]Because sometimes when they get clumped up, it's hard to get them.
[70:39.67]63.
[70:40.45]Up and around.
[70:42.21]I do like this one, though.
[70:44.47]It's the most difficult arcade game in, um, at least in North America.
[70:48.92]I don't know about other countries and continents.
[70:53.81]Was everybody blanking?
[70:54.53]What's going on here?
[70:58.97]I'm seeing a shitload of links.
[70:59.85]What is this?
[71:14.95]What?
[71:15.23]When did I do that?
[71:17.27]Did I do that today?
[71:19.23]When?
[71:26.63]Hold on.
[71:45.54]Did I sneeze?
[71:49.44]It's something sterva sour.
[72:03.07]Let's get back to the activity, please.
[72:05.53]I'm almost done with the, uh, chicken.
[72:06.93]69, 70, 71, 72, 73.
[72:10.70]Is that it?
[72:11.60]Is that it?
[72:12.00]That's it.
[72:12.32]That's it.
[72:40.38]It's France apparently.
[72:42.92]That's the Keyblade version of France.
[72:57.07]Somebody said Keyblade, and then I said France, and I morphed it together for a fucking perfect piece of comedy.
[73:08.08]Put on background music, blank stare streamer.
[73:11.82]No, music distracts me.
[73:12.98]I don't like it.
[73:16.74]Let's get another story.
[73:21.96]That was the bird from the arcade game that I played.
[73:25.04]Excellent.
[73:25.68]Excellent.
[73:33.74]Okay, let's try this one.
[73:36.07]I'll do two three in a row.
[73:46.00]I'm just scrolling down.
[73:47.18]There's so many stories.
[73:48.82]Alright, we'll grab these two.
[74:02.63]Alright, that looks good.
[74:05.59]Next dot to dot.
[74:08.99]What is it?
[74:09.31]I actually don't remember.
[74:13.79]I know what that is.
[74:15.52]Still gonna be fun to do, though.
[74:19.42]Pull back a little bit, yeah.
[74:21.98]I was wandering alone in the woods one day when I came across a little door carved into the stump of an old oak tree.
[74:28.67]Magical stuff, okay.
[74:29.73]I knelt down and knocked carefully with one finger, hoping not to startle its inhabitant.
[74:35.89]The little door slowly creaked open, and out popped the head of a curious little creature.
[74:42.80]It asks in a tiny, timid voice.
[74:45.74]Just a traveler, I respond, do you mind if I poke my head inside?
[74:51.14]Not at all, replies the creature, retreating back into its hovel.
[74:56.19]I lay down on my stomach and open the door, and as soon as I stick my head through the opening the gremlin rips ass all over my face.
[75:04.78]I recoil in disgust and destroy its entire house.
[75:08.90]God, I fucking hate elves.
[75:11.43]The euphoric land of nacho fries is getting an upgrade.
[75:14.83]Wait, wait, this is not... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[75:19.79]Closing square bracket.
[75:21.23]There you go.
[75:21.61]The euphoric land of nacho fries is getting an upgrade.
[75:24.93]Oh, an upgrade for nacho fries.
[75:25.93]Taco Bell announced Thursday that it's ratcheting up the heat on its new favorite side dish with two new test items.
[75:33.04]Two new items at Taco Bell?
[75:33.98]Rattlesnake fries and Reaper Ranch fries are variants on the much-loved fries that will eat more like a meal.
[75:39.96]What?
[75:41.04]However, unlike plain old nacho fries, the hilarious names of these seasoned starch sticks tell you absolutely nothing about what they're...
[75:50.10]so here goes rattlesnake fries are a big basket of fries topped with nacho cheese steak creamy jalapeño sauce and pickled jalapeños
[76:01.63]Its Grim Brethren is named after the Carolina Reaper pepper.
[76:05.75]These spicy fellas are available as fries and sauce or in a Supreme version, topped with nacho cheese, seasoned beef, Reaper ranch sauce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream.
[76:16.60]This all sounds great, but there's good news and bad news.
[76:22.14]The bad news is that, for the time being, these new additions are only available as test items.
[76:28.89]The Rattlesnake Fries and Rattlesnake Burrito, because you can get that pile of toppings inside a burrito, too, is only available starting August 16 in Columbus, Ohio.
[76:41.05]The Reaper Fries and Reaper Burrito are only available beginning August 16 in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[76:48.53]All of the items will stick around until mid-September.
[76:50.89]Why would you post this in here?
[76:52.27]Closing square bracket.
[76:54.11]The good news is that Taco Bell also announced it's once again extending the stay of nacho fries.
[77:00.23]This is a different one.
[77:01.43]Those will now be available nationwide through mid-September.
[77:05.50]Enjoy them while you can.
[77:07.46]Those are two separate stories?
[77:11.88]Okay, do rattlesnake fries actually exist or was that just somebody just throwing up nonsense?
[77:24.14]81, 82, 83, 84.
[77:26.90]I like this one.
[77:27.52]It's cute.
[77:28.04]Look at how cute this one is.
[77:31.44]Got it.
[77:32.46]There it is.
[77:33.92]That is jermaChomp.
[77:39.19]Some would argue the best emote on the whole platform.
[77:43.47]Especially on the Jerma985 channel.
[77:51.70]That's cool.
[77:54.32]I've heard the argument that's the best emote on 985.
[78:00.13]Okay.
[78:01.41]Very cool.
[78:01.87]jermaRat.
[78:02.37]jermaChomp.
[78:04.72]Let's keep going.
[78:19.91]Thank you.
[78:50.41]Oh shit, I gotta flip it.
[78:58.80]Somebody's gonna be getting this tonight.
[79:03.38]O-W-O, Griller.
[79:05.26]That's me, that's me!
[79:07.17]What will young Jeremy be giving himself tonight?
[79:09.25]Connect the dots below to find out what it is.
[79:12.59]Worst stream of the year.
[79:16.53]I gotta flip it.
[79:18.47]Hold on, I gotta flip this one.
[79:30.53]hold on I gotta flip it I gotta flip it I gotta flip it can I even flip this on stream oh I don't think I can flip this on stream oh yeah I can no I got it
[79:58.70]Now I just flip it.
[80:00.06]How do you flip something in, uh, Microsoft?
[80:03.40]Flaa- I got it.
[80:04.69]Turn the monitor sideways.
[80:08.41]I got it, I got it, everything- I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[80:11.93]I do like the Mario Tennis in the background on this one too.
[80:14.87]Alright, let's go.
[80:21.96]This one's gonna be gold.
[80:23.66]Uh-oh!
[80:24.96]Uh-oh!
[80:28.36]I'm using the free version.
[80:29.68]I don't have the upgraded Epic Pro pen.
[80:37.98]Gold.
[80:38.47]Here we go.
[80:39.57]Let's do thicker.
[80:46.87]One, two, three.
[80:48.35]Wait.
[80:49.41]No, no, no.
[80:51.25]This is color coded.
[80:54.38]What a cheat.
[80:54.92]You're cheap.
[80:57.04]What do you mean I'm cheap?
[81:01.12]How am I cheap?
[81:02.08]Because I'm using it for its purpose.
[81:04.36]It's designed for purpose.
[81:05.12]One, two, three... Four, five... Wait, what?
[81:17.25]What did I do?
[81:17.99]One... Oh, it's segmented.
[81:27.35]Oh, clever.
[81:28.25]Actually clever.
[81:28.91]Okay.
[81:31.60]And then the blue is up here.
[81:35.15]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[81:42.87]It's a rat.
[81:49.33]Okay, then down here.
[81:52.75]One, two, three, four, five.
[81:58.45]One, two, three, four, five.
[82:10.54]I'm not going to write that.
[82:11.34]I was just going to write, like, game sucks and point to Mario Tennis, but I'm not going to do that.
[82:16.59]That's adorable.
[82:17.25]Thank you.
[82:18.53]That's fucking beautiful.
[82:24.35]Alright, how quickly can I...
[82:47.96]Not bad.
[82:48.36]That was pretty fast.
[82:49.06]Wait.
[82:51.48]Wait.
[82:55.35]Pretty good.
[82:56.89]I will say.
[82:57.47]Alright, let's do the next one.
[82:59.15]I got a couple more stories here, too.
[83:06.51]This just kind of freaks me out a little.
[83:08.63]Here, look.
[83:11.04]I forgot what this program did, and I got scared that I did burn-in on my monitor.
[83:25.94]Alright.
[83:27.78]Next song is... I mean, come on.
[83:29.50]It's going to be Undertale's hair.
[83:31.38]Okay, next story.
[83:32.44]Okay.
[83:49.05]Wait, I'm in the wrong thing.
[83:53.58]I'm in the wrong... Hold on.
[83:54.86]Okay, now I'm in stories.
[83:56.08]Here we go.
[84:02.08]Here comes another one.
[84:03.72]Everybody loves to just, like, make me like a little elf.
[84:12.29]Like a little goblin.
[84:16.59]I would not be a goblin, okay?
[84:19.55]I would be... I'm just going to give you a... This is real.
[84:22.15]This is real life.
[84:23.21]This is reality.
[84:25.13]If I was like one of those LOL fantasy-like creatures, I would be a hobbit.
[84:30.99]Okay?
[84:34.62]This kind of face.
[84:36.04]Don't fit on a goblin.
[84:40.90]Sorry, I had something stuck in my teeth.
[84:46.10]Let's go!
[84:55.27]People are going to be real mad about this one.
[85:06.05]Not the story, the image.
[85:08.92]One time I was at my local Walmart minding my business when I felt something brush against my leg.
[85:16.24]Glancing down, I chuckled as I saw a small child who only came up to around my knees walking past with an armful of cheesy...
[85:25.18]Watch where you're going, kid, I said, smiling at him before turning away.
[85:30.82]Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my foot and looked down to see the small child underneath me, glaring up angrily at the comparative giant above him.
[85:40.37]What the heck did you just call me?
[85:43.13]he demanded in a surprisingly deep Bostonian accent that sounded familiar.
[85:48.75]I leaned down to examine the child more closely before recoiling in shock.
[85:53.87]This was no child.
[85:55.59]It was Jerma.
[85:56.81]I'll have you know I'm a top 1000 streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[86:03.30]Jerma continued, his comically small face contorted with rage.
[86:08.08]Naturally, I quickly apologized and asked for a photo, declaring he was my favorite compact streamer.
[86:15.49]Eventually, after promising 10,000 bits as compensation for the cheesy I had squashed, Jerma let me take a photo with him.
[86:25.09]It was Kim, who was about my height.
[86:27.69]She hurried over and scooped up the reluctant Jermai in her arms before depositing him in her shopping trolley, where he sat a day with his arms crossed.
[86:37.28]She thanked me for taking care of him and talked him into accepting 1000 bits from me instead, before bidding her farewells and walking away.
[86:54.56]Just once.
[86:55.60]Will there ever be a story where I'm not, like, the little mutant that, like, bites people?
[87:02.19]Why can't somebody tell a story of me as, like, fucking Zeus or something?
[87:05.75]Like, as a god?
[87:11.34]Now that would be... Nobody would see that coming.
[87:18.01]Alright, let's finish this one.
[87:19.25]This is Pokémon and JoJo pose.
[87:30.24]I like this Pikachu rat.
[87:32.44]That's a nice touch.
[87:36.54]Kinect said you were 3 out of 10.
[87:41.24]Oh, no, you would... No, no, no, no, no.
[87:42.84]For a second, I thought you were saying, like, I'm a 3 out of 10.
[87:46.42]No, I'm definitely not a failing grade.
[87:47.84]I can tell you.
[87:48.32]I promise you.
[87:49.02]Let me tell you something.
[87:49.92]I can tell you something.
[87:50.52]Let me tell you something.
[87:51.08]I can tell you.
[87:54.80]Cadences.
[87:56.48]Those cadences.
[87:57.32]We have cadences.
[88:00.74]Top 1,000 streamer.
[88:03.67]I've gone up since then.
[88:06.19]I'm top, like, 860.
[88:12.63]oh god phylactery phylactery coming in with another 69 fucking subs 69 subs fucking every stream every single stream you you've lost your mind but I do appreciate it that's a shitload of money the madman the madman did it again
[88:50.67]That's it.
[88:51.73]How many total?
[88:54.21]You're almost at a thousand community subs.
[89:00.49]That is way too many.
[89:03.55]That's a fucking million.
[89:05.85]That may as well be a million.
[89:12.38]Oh my god.
[89:15.38]Yo, can I get one?
[89:17.44]You hang around long enough, you probably will.
[89:22.65]But let's say that's a fucking lot of money.
[89:24.75]You give it almost every stream.
[89:26.15]And I know I don't want to sound like I'm just glossing over that.
[89:30.69]Like, hey, thanks for the 70 subs.
[89:32.13]Okay, let's go.
[89:35.09]But seriously, you have given so much fucking money that I can't even comprehend it.
[89:40.93]Thank you so much for your insane contributions.
[89:43.89]Hope I put it to good use.
[89:48.50]Now let's do more dot to dots.
[89:52.22]Wait, I gotta show the screen.
[89:55.87]Nah, I like that.
[90:02.40]Did you know that somebody linked me an image of them scanning my face into a program?
[90:10.88]And the program said that I was 91% attractive, my forehead was too small.
[90:15.85]I read all your tweets, guys.
[90:17.11]I read all of them.
[90:17.93]I don't reply to fucking anybody, but... Well, I don't reply to everybody.
[90:23.78]I do read them.
[90:27.68]Did you give more subs?
[90:28.80]You gave 28 more subs.
[90:38.51]That's fucking ridiculous, man.
[90:41.53]Thank you.
[90:43.51]Oh, you made it to a thousand subs.
[90:51.66]I would probably tell you at this point, that's good.
[90:56.21]That's good.
[90:59.31]That's good.
[91:00.79]That's a lot of fucking money for one person to be holding that many subs.
[91:09.18]That is insane.
[91:14.38]A thousand sub gifted badge at one time.
[91:18.10]Responsible at the same time.
[91:26.03]This one guy, this truly, this truly one guy is responsible for a fucking thousand of your subscriptions.
[91:37.94]That's a pretty ridiculous one guy statement.
[91:42.38]He owns 25% of my entire stock.
[91:47.45]I gotta be careful, because if he gets past like 50%, then I'm gonna lose the fucking company.
[91:57.30]It's the beginning of the hostile takeover.
[92:04.26]No, file actor, I'm just kidding.
[92:08.52]You've done way more than enough.
[92:10.74]More, a trillion times more than enough.
[92:15.45]Thank you so fucking much, dude, that's insane.
[92:19.53]Hope you enjoy the carnival.
[92:24.77]Way to go!
[92:36.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[92:40.37]Fun, fun, fun, dot to dot.
[92:42.79]What is it?
[92:51.83]It's funny.
[92:52.35]This is actually fun.
[92:53.09]This is very funny.
[92:55.56]Because... I got a similar joke.
[93:04.40]I got a similar joke.
[93:06.62]That means great minds think alike.
[93:13.26]Anyways, I know what this is.
[93:15.07]Because, I mean, come on.
[93:17.11]It's me.
[93:17.41]6, 7, 8, 9...
[93:32.80]I'm so happy to see this because, like, this is, that's a, this, what, like, what, like, am I on facecam and I feel like I have to, like, like, overanimate my face?
[93:43.07]No, am I just like that?
[93:43.90]Do I do this?
[93:44.38]I just saw myself in the Viewfinder here.
[93:46.88]And I was like, let me tell you something.
[93:48.62]Like, what, why am I overanimating my face?
[93:50.72]Do I do that?
[93:51.28]I gotta ask fucking my friends.
[94:05.34]His actor friends.
[94:11.72]I got actors.
[94:12.38]42, 43.
[94:18.03]Let me go down from here.
[94:24.58]48, 49, 50... 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59... I'm gonna sneeze on camera and I don't- I can't do anything.
[94:37.14]That was real, I swear to God that was fucking real.
[95:00.32]I can hold in sneezes actually really well, but I always feel like I look like such a psycho.
[95:05.50]I'll be sitting in public, especially at a restaurant.
[95:08.95]If I have a big sneeze and I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to do that.
[95:14.41]I don't want to be the person that... Hold on, another one.
[95:18.21]I don't want to be the person that everybody looks over to and goes, what the fuck?
[95:23.84]Because regardless, everybody coughs, everybody sneezes, everybody, it happens.
[95:27.44]You get like the thing in your, the sensitivity in your nose and you end up doing it, right?
[95:30.48]Whatever.
[95:32.24]But you feel horrible when you do that.
[95:33.96]If I'm sitting in like a nice restaurant and all of a sudden you're like... You just, I feel every eye, I feel all the forks, I can hear the forks.
[95:42.18]And I fucking, I hear and feel the eyes looking at me.
[95:45.92]So when I'm at a restaurant, it's like I dump it into the back of my eyes.
[95:52.26]Contrary to popular belief, when you hold in a sneeze, it's not like your throat or your chest or your nose that actually has the pain and the suffering.
[95:59.82]It's your eyes.
[96:01.00]So when I like... You sneeze like back here in the back of your eyes.
[96:06.47]And it's like... So that's why you try to do it in a way where you can sneeze but still not sneeze.
[96:12.57]So right there what happened was just pull the clip back.
[96:14.33]I sneezed but it was like...
[96:17.09]I got all of it out that I needed to.
[96:19.11]I didn't hold it in.
[96:20.07]I'm a fucking expert at this at this point.
[96:25.48]If you sneeze on your hands, you're a degenerate.
[96:30.18]Would you rather I sneeze into your burrito?
[96:35.12]Do you want me to, like, grab the plate from in front of you and sneeze onto the plate of your fucking king salmon?
[96:39.86]Which, what would you like me to do?
[96:42.08]Into your elbow.
[96:43.28]So you want me to go, like, and then, like, boom, now you have a point of contact here.
[96:49.46]That is not closed.
[96:50.82]And it's just gonna go, boom, that way, straight, directly on your fucking face.
[96:56.56]You wanna do that into your shirt?
[96:57.96]Okay, let's go into my shirt here.
[97:01.39]Now what I've done is I have just ruined the rest of my night.
[97:05.41]Because that's here now.
[97:06.41]That's all over me.
[97:07.07]And it's like it's in my body now.
[97:10.09]And like I have to take a shower.
[97:15.13]What are you supposed to do?
[97:21.83]Do it straight upwards.
[97:23.69]No.
[97:24.09]You either go like this.
[97:27.00]So there is no escape now.
[97:29.94]And then you go and you wash your hands.
[97:34.14]If you go like this.
[97:37.08]There's only one place for it to go.
[97:39.90]I've seen people go like this.
[97:42.14]And it's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[97:43.96]What are you thinking?
[97:45.30]You're just concentrating a cannon to be able to shoot it out.
[97:52.31]Or if you really are like desperate, grab a fucking cup and like, no, don't do that.
[98:03.52]Elbow.
[98:04.68]If you do it, then you got this all over you.
[98:07.70]On your nice shirt.
[98:08.54]And then what, are you going to wipe it off?
[98:09.72]What if it's a big snot?
[98:12.16]What happens if you have a huge fucking snot all over you now?
[98:15.12]And you have a meeting in 20 minutes.
[98:17.52]Oh, good to meet you.
[98:19.00]What the fuck is that on your shaking hand, dick?
[98:21.88]Get off of me.
[98:22.72]Don't look at me.
[98:26.10]Those of you that just haven't been in the business world.
[98:29.89]You never compromise your shaking hand or your greeting hand.
[98:35.71]Both of your hands.
[98:36.37]Oh, you can't do that.
[98:37.59]Do not compromise your shaking hand.
[98:40.21]So if you have to do it, make sure you sneeze into the elbow that is not going to be used as your compromised greeting hand.
[98:50.53]Or just fucking have tissues.
[98:53.01]Done.
[98:53.55]End of story.
[98:54.55]I'm talking about emergency scenarios.
[99:00.63]I just missed all those.
[99:02.11]Who is it?
[99:07.59]Sneeze into their hand.
[99:09.13]Sneeze into your hand and then shake their hand.
[99:11.31]Well, that would be a disgusting, awful thing to do.
[99:20.12]It's me.
[99:25.22]Drink cold water?
[99:26.10]No, you don't have to do that.
[99:38.29]Does it have a nose?
[99:39.73]No.
[99:47.07]There it goes.
[99:47.45]Alright, let's get another story on here.
[99:48.87]I'm not even halfway through all these stories.
[99:57.96]I'm just scrolling to try to find random ones.
[99:59.60]Alright, I'll put like three or four on now.
[100:25.22]Alright.
[100:36.07]Some of these are like just a sentence of making fun of me.
[100:40.37]So hold on.
[100:41.61]What if he's blind?
[100:44.69]Keep posting the link.
[100:48.12]I don't want to show it on camera.
[100:49.44]What is it?
[100:54.26]Blind, disgusting streamer.
[101:04.31]Whatever.
[101:04.65]That's not embarrassing to me.
[101:14.36]This is not like an embarrassing thing.
[101:16.44]It's just I sneezed.
[101:24.88]In fact, the thing you linked earlier could have been a sneeze.
[101:35.06]Where is it?
[101:39.66]How are these two images different?
[101:44.56]Oh, nice, Ron.
[101:46.33]Well, I can't sneeze.
[101:47.39]I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[101:49.79]Nice, Ron.
[101:57.26]Let me get it right.
[101:58.70]Nice, Ron.
[102:00.84]Well, I sneeze, but I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[102:04.01]Give me five minutes with a voice and I'll get it fucking perfect.
[102:06.65]Throw one out here.
[102:07.23]Anybody.
[102:07.73]Anything.
[102:08.27]I don't care what it is.
[102:08.77]Throw something out.
[102:09.35]Anything.
[102:15.23]My dad, okay?
[102:17.87]Son, how are you?
[102:19.55]Hey.
[102:20.91]David, it's me, your dad.
[102:22.79]Next one, please.
[102:33.69]Daffy Duck.
[102:37.28]Daffy Duck is the Looney Tunes one, right?
[102:44.92]You're... You're despicable.
[102:57.05]Some things you can't do.
[103:00.08]Ooh, that was not good.
[103:02.25]That was very bad.
[103:04.25]Some things, I'm glad I turned the camera off, though, so that you can't prove that was me.
[103:09.49]You don't know that was me or not, because the fucking camera was off.
[103:13.56]That's a 600 fucking million IQ play.
[103:19.38]Dude, Tom Hanks?
[103:20.80]I can't even, what happened here?
[103:22.65]I forgot to turn the camera off.

[103:59.65]Hey.
[104:00.52]Hey, yo.
[104:01.92]Hey, what's going on?
[104:03.20]It's me, Jerma.
[104:05.56]The only thing that I have is a Boston fucking accent, dude.
[104:10.68]Everything else is fucking who cares?
[104:13.50]Just go like this and fucking make a Boston fucking accent, dude.
[104:29.12]What am I doing?
[104:29.68]Oh yeah, right, this.
[104:32.26]Alright, let's go.
[104:32.92]Next one.
[104:37.84]Do a Southie accent?
[104:38.68]The Southie accent's like this.
[104:41.18]Every word just fucking runs into each other.
[104:42.50]Even though it sounds so much more Southie because they're just... Every word just runs right into the next word.
[104:49.78]They're getting in cabs and shit and they're going out and stuff.
[104:56.92]Go to the socks again.
[105:02.12]Where's Elmo?
[105:02.78]I can do Elmo like that.
[105:04.72]No, I'm not doing fucking Elmo.
[105:06.26]I'm doing something.
[105:09.32]What am I doing?
[105:10.28]No, we're like in the middle of something.
[105:13.74]Here.
[105:15.60]Here, quiet.
[105:16.98]Children!
[105:18.02]All the children, please quiet for a story!
[105:21.37]The drawstrings of my pants just flop directly into a urinal.
[105:26.93]WTF do I even do now?
[105:29.55]I've been walking around like I'm wearing a diaper cause I don't want them to touch me.
[105:38.52]A couple weeks ago I had a nightmare.
[105:42.52]This wasn't an ordinary nightmare.
[105:44.60]It was a nightmare inside a nightmare.
[105:47.04]Inception type stuff.
[105:49.67]It started out with me being trapped with other random people inside this old cabin in the woods, we couldn't leave the room.
[105:57.81]I'll spare the insane details but it was scary.
[106:01.31]Very scary.
[106:02.75]It ended up with a man relieving himself in the corner of the room, at that point it became obvious to me that this was a nightmare, I told myself I had to wake up.
[106:12.98]After waking up I told myself, nice I finally woke up from this nightmare.
[106:19.00]Oh cool there's a can of nasty in my bed, let me take a sip.
[106:23.40]I never drink nasty, especially not in bed.
[106:26.81]I realized I was still dreaming and I had to wake up again.
[106:31.39]After waking up for the second time, I looked around making sure why was truly awake.
[106:37.65]I think I am awake.
[106:39.57]I remain unsure.
[106:41.27]I now have trouble sleeping every night, wondering if I never woke up.
[106:48.66]actually good link I'm just wait I'm busy just hold on a minute I'm busy I'm in the middle of my project 33 34 37 38 alright we're going this way now
[107:17.81]40, 41, 42, around the shoulder here.
[107:19.91]Look at those big, broad fucking shoulders.
[107:23.17]Those are shoulders that people dream about having.
[107:24.97]49, 50, ah!
[107:28.29]55, and then go up.
[107:28.89]56, 57, this is a good one.
[107:45.10]Broad shoulders, short legs, no.
[107:48.40]Let me correct you.
[107:50.25]Broad shoulders, short legs, long torso.
[107:53.83]I have like a swimmer's body.
[107:56.69]I have a long body.
[107:59.21]My chest to my legs is very long.
[108:11.34]How do I know that?
[108:14.15]I look at myself naked every single fucking day.
[108:25.80]Alright, do I have glasses on?
[108:27.06]Okay, you're gonna get an ear stream for a little bit.
[108:33.04]Oh man.

[108:51.31]82, 83?
[109:07.39]From here to here, from here to there.
[109:10.81]That's a scary mask.
[109:12.55]Yes, it is.
[109:20.16]Alright, hold on!
[109:29.65]No, this is... Do I have teeth showing in this?
[109:36.03]No, I don't.
[109:36.45]It's open mouth.
[109:49.50]What?
[110:03.38]I'm not going- No, I go- Am I going- No, I'm going like this.

[110:13.59]What do you mean, Rick and Morty?

[110:18.69]You don't have to- It's a series of, like, numbers as spam.
[110:27.58]Alright, that was good.
[110:30.12]Sure, alright.
[110:30.78]Okay, okay, okay.
[110:31.72]Alright, everybody.

[110:42.96]Go ahead.
[110:43.46]Let's see it.
[110:47.62]If this is a variation of a sneeze, I'm not going to even open it.
[110:55.94]Hold on.
[111:03.67]Is it a sneeze?
[111:10.22]Are you guys really spamming another link that's just a sneeze again?
[111:15.06]That's fucking scary.
[111:16.12]I don't know what that is.
[111:19.10]Okay, hold on.
[111:22.80]And this is the other one.
[111:32.08]It's not a sneeze.
[111:36.16]I look like somebody.
[111:38.08]Who the fuck do I look like in this image?
[111:40.16]This is like freaking me out.
[112:18.90]This is what you guys wanted me to see so bad.
[112:22.14]It was like a Megamind again.
[112:25.38]Another Megamind image.
[112:33.76]This one though is fucking with my head.
[112:35.94]Because I feel like I could look like that in like 40 years, 30 years.
[112:39.70]Alright, let's get another couple stories.
[112:52.19]okay I think this one might be a scary story so get your this is a scary face emote monkaS ready because this is going to be scary I think guys I'm not around
[113:27.39]Okay, we'll do this one.
[113:32.63]This one's a poem.
[113:35.56]Gotta get the bracket in there so you know it's a new segment.
[113:37.76]Alright, let's go.
[113:39.64]Next one.
[113:40.30]Incoming.
[113:41.60]Incoming.
[113:48.65]Now here's the rare event where I don't really have any idea what this is.
[113:53.25]Pretty rare that I don't know that.
[113:56.23]I don't know what this is.
[114:02.66]But let's get the, let's get the stories going.
[114:09.43]Should I do, let's just do the regular ones.
[114:10.87]I had a dream one day.
[114:12.35]I was walking through a field of corn down a lonely dirt road.
[114:17.69]When to my right I passed an ugly old scarecrow.
[114:21.54]His face was dirty and covered in straw, his arm sticks with gloves nailed on.
[114:26.95]His straw hat let more light through than it kept out.
[114:30.51]I glanced at him and quickly turned away.
[114:32.69]His gaze was too stern.
[114:35.19]His face too creepy.
[114:36.89]Along the path I went, not sure where I was going or where I'd been.
[114:40.94]I see the scarecrow up ahead, as if I'd somehow gone back a mile.
[114:47.16]But I hadn't.
[114:48.00]You couldn't get lost on a path straight as this.
[114:51.56]I kept going, shying away from his gaze.
[114:54.86]As I kept walking I saw him, again and again.
[114:58.42]I lost my nerve and ran, ran as fast as I could, until I didn't see him anymore.
[115:04.91]I felt confident and shouted with joy, spinning around, ecstatic in victory.
[115:10.93]Only I was cut short, because on the path behind me, there he was.
[115:15.62]In the middle of the dirt road.
[115:17.76]I stood stock still, too scared to breath.
[115:21.17]Once again I panic and sprint, running until I lose my breath.
[115:26.01]I glance behind me and he's only closer.
[115:28.87]I turn to keep running but there he is again, closer still.
[115:32.11]I keep turning and turning, too scared and confused to know what's happening.
[115:38.76]Until, there he is in front of me, face to face.
[115:42.96]Closing square bracket.
[115:44.80]They say there's a mirror below the town.
[115:47.59]They say it shows the truest reflection of yourself.
[115:51.63]The few who claim they have seen it say it's in a cavern lit by mushrooms.
[115:57.05]The few all say they saw different things.
[116:00.37]Some say you'll see idyllic images that perfect you or your spirit animal.
[116:05.78]Some say you won't like what you see.
[116:08.50]I want to know the truth.
[116:10.54]I asked anyone who'd listen what they knew of the mirror.
[116:14.23]I did anything to find someone who knew.
[116:17.13]Then I found one of the few.
[116:18.67]What the fuck is this?
[116:24.97]Is this the guy from, is this Commander Video?
[116:48.02]What?
[116:50.22]This is like a beekeeper.
[116:53.33]I just did it correctly!
[116:56.39]It's a gnome.
[117:03.01]Uh... Yeah?
[117:05.95]Is it?
[117:06.71]No, this is a beekeeper.
[117:08.05]This is like the commander video.
[117:10.05]Thank you for commander video.
[117:16.99]I did it wrong.
[117:18.96]How did I do it wrong?
[117:20.73]23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 30, I didn't do it wrong?
[117:21.69]Get it out of here.
[117:22.29]Just squint really hard.
[117:24.15]Oh, right, okay, so it's the wireframe of the gnome in the new gnome 3D video game.
[117:26.41]Called, hoops, I did it again.
[117:53.10]Wait, I wasn't paying attention to this story.
[118:06.58]I want to listen to the dream one again.
[118:08.28]I had a dream one day.
[118:09.82]No, no, no, no.
[118:10.74]Where is it?
[118:13.38]This one, the mirror.
[118:14.22]They say there's a mirror below the town.
[118:17.08]They say it shows the truest reflection of yourself.
[118:21.09]The few who claim they have seen it say it's in a cavern, lit by mushrooms.
[118:26.49]The few all say they saw different things.
[118:29.75]Some say you'll see idyllic images, the perfect you or your spirit animal.
[118:35.13]Some say you won't like what you see.
[118:37.85]I want to know the truth.
[118:39.76]I asked anyone who'd listen what they knew of the mirror.
[118:43.42]I did anything to find someone who knew.
[118:46.40]Then I found one of the few.
[118:48.72]Then he told me the way to the mirror.
[118:51.30]He warned me I needed arms and armor.
[118:54.12]He warned me I wouldn't like what I saw.
[118:56.59]But I wanted to know the truth.
[118:59.23]I followed his directions to the T following the map he gave.
[119:03.63]I found the mirror sitting in a cavern lit by mushrooms.
[119:07.98]I gazed into the mirror only to see nothing.
[119:11.06]I gazed downwards, and I beheld my true self.
[119:14.85]Before me was a man half my height, clad in a purple hoodie and garish makeup.
[119:20.67]Before me he wore a red wig and chanted a lullaby.
[119:24.91]I didn't want to know the truth.
[119:27.09]No!
[119:32.99]No, it's not.
[119:42.54]It's not, it's not, it's just the lines, they just look strange.
[119:48.52]Pepe needs your help.
[119:50.76]Connect the dots to get him back into shape, or else MonkaS will be removed from Twitch chat forever!
[119:56.97]Oh no, help, hurry!
[119:59.15]I'm never gonna do it in time!
[120:00.47]I don't have, there's no green.
[120:04.61]We'll do blue.
[120:07.10]Oh no.
[120:15.92]I'm gonna hurry, I'm gonna do it!
[121:05.08]Wait a minute.
[121:13.42]This is Garfield without the whiskers.
[122:16.12]Okay, let's get another story.
[122:18.12]That was weird.
[122:26.53]I just, I saw it here.
[122:28.03]Wait a minute.
[122:28.59]Hold, wait a minute.
[122:39.98]Wait a minute.
[122:48.79]It's Homer Simpson, too.
[123:12.54]I'm going too deep, I think.
[123:17.22]Alright, let's put on some music.
[123:18.86]18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23!
[123:31.38]Let's do it quick!
[123:32.40]41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50!
[123:56.08]That's it.
[123:56.48]I did it.
[124:00.56]Oh wait, it's Sans too!
[124:11.45]Sans is seriously like... I'm done with Sans.
[124:14.49]You know?
[124:17.29]That's too easy.
[124:18.73]That's too easy to make.
[124:20.09]I'm done with Sans, I think.
[124:21.67]Me and Sans are done.
[124:26.23]Yeah, I don't think I, I don't, I don't, I'm done with Sans.
[124:32.90]Sans isn't done with you.
[124:40.16]I got it.
[124:46.37]Fun fact, member of the Boston Celtics.
[124:48.21]I know who this is.
[124:50.09]Come on, this looks good.
[124:53.31]When am I gonna play Deltarune again?
[124:54.69]I'll play it in seven years when the next episode comes out.
[125:02.98]Alright, so let's just do the black ink.
[125:07.72]How's that look, can you see it?
[125:09.96]Zoom in a little.
[125:11.98]Let me get another story.
[125:13.44]Those are fan favorites.
[125:30.02]Okay, I don't... This one's confusing.
[125:41.51]I don't know what the fuck this one means.
[125:44.19]But I am scanning through these very... Just preliminarily... Preliminarily... Preliminarily... Preliminarily... What am I trying to say?
[125:56.28]Spell it for me.
[125:58.00]I am... I am preliminarily...
[126:03.05]I am preliminarily.
[126:05.14]How do you say that word?
[126:10.72]I am beforehand going to put this up and look at it.
[126:15.02]Preliminarily.
[126:16.84]Preliminarily.
[126:17.82]Preliminarily.
[126:18.70]There it is.
[126:19.49]Thank you for the English majors.
[126:21.77]I think I need to fucking eat a bowl of cereal.
[126:28.33]Preliminarily.
[126:30.61]Preliminarily.
[126:36.89]Okay.
[126:45.56]I don't know what the fuck that means, but I'm gonna just hope it's not anything fucking bad.
[126:49.50]I don't even know what this means, but congratulations, here come two more stories, let's go.
[126:53.12]I was walking home from school many, many moons ago.
[126:57.30]This other kid got off her bike and held my hand.
[127:01.00]She wanted me to say hi to her, but I said no.
[127:05.06]I looked back up to see her riding away, flipping me the mighty bird.
[127:10.25]God wrenching.
[127:11.51]This is a moment, my friends.
[127:14.07]We all have an amazing chance to make a difference in someone's life.
[127:18.53]Your kindness and compassion may make a difference to a person.
[127:22.65]Your compassion and help may even stop an accident.
[127:26.49]Your presence may keep an entire church going.
[127:29.91]Your presence with a friend will give them a lift and allow them to walk many more miles.
[127:35.78]A smile may brighten someone's day, but a middle finger will ruin a lifetime.
[127:41.14]When you return, I'll have solved the problem of gravity.
[127:45.08]You have my W-A-H-H-D.
[127:48.14]Closing square bracket.
[127:50.05]I'm here to announce our new game at E3.
[127:53.43]It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[127:56.07]You'll probably hear plenty of that from people over in Australia.
[128:00.61]In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.
[128:05.04]Cerny, it's not going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider yet.
[128:09.71]It's going to be called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[128:12.93]I love the sound of that name.
[128:15.39]It's going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider for some sort of convention in 2014.
[128:19.39]The Tomb Raider title is being developed by a group of team members.
[128:26.12]And they're actually talking about a new game.
[128:29.43]Cerny, one of these days we're going to announce that game at E3 this year, or soon after, or maybe even early next year.
[128:37.77]But at this point we're actually trying to convince people to actually buy and play the game instead of just to enjoy the game and see their own photos in its world.
[128:48.04]But as far as we know this isn't a sequel or reboot right now, sir I know.
[128:58.28]It's not called Tale of the Tomb Raider.
[129:00.48]It's Tale of the Tomb Raider.
[129:02.86]Tales of the Tomb Raider.
[129:04.28]What's this, G?
[129:05.48]Oh, it's G. Cool.
[129:07.40]Nice.
[129:14.49]Nice.
[129:15.91]I like it.
[129:17.35]Tale of the Vroom Raider.
[129:22.55]Nice job.
[129:25.41]Ugh.
[129:28.05]Might as well get a few more stories.
[129:29.43]Alright, I'm loading up just like three of them in a row.
[129:40.43]Half of them are just nonsense anyways.
[129:42.05]It's not like, what am I going to do?
[130:05.50]Okay, let's do this one.
[130:07.82]I'm just scrolling.
[130:10.16]I'm just scrolling.
[130:21.19]Some of these are long.
[130:21.92]This is long.
[130:22.80]Some of these are really long.
[130:40.89]Okay, here we go.
[130:43.03]I got these three of them here.
[130:44.43]I need to separate.
[130:45.55]I don't have any brackets anymore.
[130:47.52]I'm out of brackets.
[131:05.93]Okay, here we go.
[131:09.53]Next image.
[131:13.91]What the fuck is this one?
[131:25.00]One time in seventh grade, one was trying to jump down the stairs to impress all the girls.
[131:31.64]I was leaning forward from the top step and holding the railing about halfway down the stairs, planning on swinging from the top to the bottom.
[131:40.29]Well, my hand slipped, and I ended up tumbling head over heels down the stairs and I landed flat on my back.
[131:48.72]I tried to recover all cool by sitting up and saying, well that just happened, and went to my next class, which was gym.
[131:56.48]I think we played dodgeball or something.
[131:59.51]Whatever it was, it was pretty boring.
[132:02.23]Then after class my teacher came up to me and said, did you fall down the stairs earlier today?
[132:09.07]I said, yeah, but it's not a big deal.
[132:11.87]She told me to go to the nurse's office, which I did.
[132:15.42]And when I told them what happened, they called my mom and sent me home.
[132:20.30]So I got to go home early and watch TV because I tried and failed to impress some girls in seventh grade.
[132:27.54]Pretty good deal, if I'm honest.
[132:30.38]Closing square bracket.
[132:32.34]I brought up parts of this story in an online chat room I'm in but I thought it's worth sharing it in their entirety.
[132:40.15]I had two dreams recently that had an individual that must have made some impact with how dreams work and remembering them is uncommon.
[132:49.15]The recent dream had him crashing at my place to avoid paying for a hotel.
[132:54.33]I fucked it up?
[133:15.11]It was just us and the road.
[133:17.41]Eventually, they pulled off the road to park.
[133:20.60]I watched them step out and round the front and with no rhyme or reason, they started to take the pants off.
[133:27.76]Shocked, I grabbed for the door handle but I woke up before I could.
[133:32.61]Heart pounding with the dream still fresh, I mumbled, since when did you drive Joma?
[133:38.79]If they ever read this somehow, thank you so much for the talk.
[133:42.42]It was fun and we had a lot of laughs.
[133:45.35]You also said some things that were uplifting and made me reflect on some things.
[133:51.32]Gosh, I really wish I could remember what was said.
[133:54.04]Thank you again, but, uh, I think I should be flattered.
[133:58.71]But, you know first impressions are important, right?
[134:02.81]Closing square bracket.
[134:04.87]One, two, oatmeal.
[134:06.25]Kirby is wanted on four counts of homicide and seven counts of grand theft larceny.
[134:12.39]Kirby was last seen in Dreamland sucking off bark from these weird face trees.
[134:18.57]Officers tried to detain Kirby, but he managed to escape by eating him whole.
[134:24.05]There were absolutely no survivors, but we managed to recover this information off of the live feed of one of our officers' bodyguards.
[134:32.77]We believe that Kirby's current motives are to overtake King Dedede and, quote, wear his ass like a helmet.
[134:39.67]We can only speculate the motives.
[134:42.27]His partner, Meta Knight, was also seen blowing a guy in the alley.
[134:47.07]If you see Kirby, do not approach him.
[134:49.93]If he offers you oatmeal, he's trying to fuck you.
[134:53.35]Do not approach him.
[134:54.91]He will get inside of you any way he can.
[134:57.25]He is a dangerous and lethal character.
[135:00.65]Do not go near him.
[135:02.56]I know this first hand, because when I was in the field, and he was just a new suspect, I thought oh, that's just a little pink blob, he's not gonna do anything.
[135:19.35]Those are three stories.
[135:26.84]I am having a lot of trouble trying to see what this one is.
[135:29.50]41, 42, 43, 44.
[135:31.76]47.
[135:31.80]Down to 48?
[135:50.31]50, down to 51.
[135:50.71]52, 53, 54.
[135:50.79]55, 56, 57.
[135:50.89]What am I making here?
[135:51.73]62.
[135:51.75]Is it a ghost?
[136:34.49]I'm squinting.
[136:35.33]It looks like somebody going like, whoa!
[136:38.55]Right?
[136:54.56]76, 37, 78, 79, 80, 81.
[136:56.48]Oh, OK.
[137:09.63]It's the walk.
[137:14.11]That's pretty good.
[137:14.83]You got to give credit for that one.
[137:18.92]That's pretty good for a connect the dots image.
[137:24.84]The smile too.
[137:26.94]The eye into the hair.
[137:27.96]That's a pretty good one.
[137:32.16]That was great.
[137:36.01]I want that as a shirt.
[137:39.31]This?
[137:42.37]That's fucking awesome.
[137:45.31]Coming up next.
[137:50.98]Another one at first glance that's kind of hard to determine.
[137:54.49]You want it with the numbers.
[137:59.21]Why with the numbers?
[138:02.78]Where's my Twitch page?
[138:04.20]Oh, it's over here.
[138:05.60]Alright, let's get another... I just saw one line on that one.
[138:20.24]I don't want to put that one on.
[138:43.65]what the fuck is this one okay I'm having like I'm having fun just browsing through the stories and trying to figure out if this is a real story a fake story or you made this and talked to transformer I think half of these were made and talked to transform
[139:12.61]In fact, this one even says, Made with Talk to Transformer on it.
[139:18.50]We'll try these few here.
[139:29.21]Alright, this is a lengthy one.
[139:32.59]I'll change the voice, too.
[139:52.17]okay alright let's do this one and I'm gonna start the puzzle he he look hold on not yet me and my pa went hunting the other day and we saw this huge bear like the bear was at least five feet tall and must have been heavier than my mom's sedan
[140:19.48]My pa told me to stare low so that it wouldn't sense us.
[140:22.62]I found that funny since I didn't know bears come with a radar.
[140:27.24]We ended up going fishing afterward because my pa told me bears can't swim.
[140:32.90]Jeremy Elbertson is a clown.
[140:37.16]His father is an alcoholic, so when Elbertson began acting as a stand-up comedian, it seemed a natural fit.
[140:44.49]But Elbertson doesn't just act like he's doing a performance.
[140:48.65]He's actually training.
[140:50.35]And he's living a life that is full of stress and responsibility.
[140:53.93]What happened with this one?
[140:54.97]Elbertson is trying to reach happiness, but as he puts it, my main goal right now is to go through the stages of grief and get it over with.
[141:03.38]What?
[141:03.94]With his mother dead and his father battling addiction, Elbertson is at a crossroads in his life.
[141:09.12]Hold on, wait, wait, what, what happened?
[141:10.44]He talks to people about the reasons for his struggle, how he got there, and what's next, all while helping some students take the first steps into stand-up comedy.
[141:20.65]You've already done a comedy album, but you're a jerk.
[141:24.01]What inspired You're Not Wrong?
[141:26.39]I never really intended to make a comedy record.
[141:29.02]I just wanted to make my voice hear and be heard.
[141:32.95]But I have a lot.
[141:34.53]Closing square bracket.
[141:36.43]I had a dream last week that I went to the movie theater with Jerma.
[141:41.44]It must have been a hilarious movie because Jerma was convulsing in laughter.
[141:45.94]We're talking visible shaking here.
[141:49.06]I lean over to Jerma and ask if he's... Hold on, wait a minute.
[141:52.84]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[141:54.72]Y'all have a lot of fucking dreams about me.
[141:56.77]Can I just say...
[141:59.70]You know, I had this dream about Jerma was, like, fucking eating people, and he, like, peed in his own face, and then he was, like, punching me.
[142:06.32]Why do I, why am I, like, hurting everybody in your dreams?
[142:12.96]Yeah, let's put on, uh... How about this one?
[142:19.49]I don't know, who is this?
[142:20.65]I had a dream last week that I went to the movie theater with Jerma.
[142:25.18]It must have been a hilarious movie because Jerma was convulsing in laughter, we're talking visible shaking here.
[142:32.36]I lean over to Jerma and ask if he's feeling alright.
[142:35.80]Jerma answers spit as a fiddle, son.
[142:38.64]Now do your old dad a favor and get us some poppin' corn.
[142:42.58]Keep the change.
[142:43.98]So Jerma hands me some bills.
[142:46.27]I walk out to the concession stand and there is a huge line in front of me as a buya, chain smoking in public.
[142:54.17]Behind me is a very polite cheetah who told me I could go in front of him since all he wanted was a diet water.
[143:01.36]After what must have been 20 minutes in line, I get to the front.
[143:05.52]One large pop and corn, please.
[143:08.02]I ask very politely to the vendor, named Peter.
[143:11.36]Peter responds, with or without butter?
[143:14.12]My knees get weak, my palms are sweaty.
[143:16.95]Fettuccine begins to drip out of my pocket, and I meekly answer.
[143:21.58]with.
[143:22.28]I hand him the money that Jeremy lent me.
[143:24.88]I'm sorry, sir.
[143:25.84]We don't accept Canadian tire money.
[143:28.36]That's when I knew I must have been dreaming for one Jerma isn't Canadian to Canadian tire money.
[143:36.79]I begrudgingly pay the vendor five Jerma bucks and return to my seat next to Jerma popcorn and he says this movie sucks.
[143:46.31]Let's get out of here.
[143:51.58]is this what is this it's jermaTV oh I thought okay I thought it was like a guy this is a hand he's like sitting down and this is his mouth and this is his eyes he got like sunglasses on you know what I'm saying alright sunglasses mouth sitting down just like relaxing going like yeah I'm gonna change jermaTV to that this is what the new email will be
[144:28.46]That's fucking funny though.
[144:29.42]I had no idea what this was until the very end.
[144:33.36]People will use it even less.
[144:34.74]Good.
[144:34.96]Alright.
[144:44.21]No, that one was good.
[144:45.07]That one was fun.
[144:55.35]Who, chat dot to dot, who asked Jerma if he ate ass?
[145:02.79]Uh... One guy?
[145:07.10]It wasn't one, it was just one guy, right?
[145:16.14]Oh, fuck, yeah!
[145:17.24]This is what that is!
[145:19.17]What, you tell me I got more colors?
[145:20.51]What am I, stupid?
[145:27.61]I didn't know I had more than that.
[145:30.21]Alright, let's do it.
[145:33.85]Is it actually going to be Jerma one guy?
[145:35.83]I'm going to be so happy if it is.
[145:48.96]It is, isn't it?
[145:53.48]Oh, yes!
[145:54.14]Yes!
[146:00.74]12 down here.
[146:01.54]Here comes a vroom.
[146:07.60]I just got a pre-vroom.
[146:09.50]Pre-vroom, here comes the big one.
[146:15.92]That was a distant vroom.
[146:19.25]Still happened though.
[146:19.93]18 and 19.
[146:21.47]Back over here. 20.
[146:30.03]20, where's 21?
[146:32.09]Oh, just wait to keep going.
[146:32.95]21, 22.
[146:35.53]23, 24 is right here, then we do the same thing this way.
[146:40.87]26, 27, I fucked it up.
[146:41.31]29, 30, 31, yeah!
[146:41.51]The nose!
[146:59.74]The nose.
[147:04.14]I love this.
[147:06.87]Wait, 27?
[147:07.09]Where?
[147:07.27]No, no, no.
[147:07.67]20, 29, 30, 31, 33.
[147:07.93]34, 35, 36.
[147:08.23]Wait, did I screw it up?
[147:08.79]What does it look like?
[147:32.93]Ah, shit.
[147:33.33]No.
[147:33.41]38, 39.
[147:33.47]No, I fucked it up again.
[147:36.85]Come on.
[147:37.49]42, 43.
[147:37.53]There it is.
[147:37.77]This emote used to cost $25 a month.
[147:46.94]Yeah, it did.
[148:05.70]This was a $25 a month emote.
[148:09.76]What a fucking ripoff.
[148:11.30]8 to 43, I screwed it up.
[148:18.82]Where?
[148:19.06]8 to 43?
[148:23.28]Is it 8?
[148:26.17]No, this is 9 right here.
[148:27.77]That's 9.
[148:30.67]Let's see what it looks like.
[148:32.83]Oh no, we lost the hair.
[148:35.82]It's all good.
[148:39.20]Now there's no $25 emote.
[148:40.28]No, there's not.
[148:44.65]I had ideas before, but... I don't know.
[148:49.09]What am I gonna put there?
[148:58.15]Okay, this is him falling and seeing the ground before him and being like, oh no, this is it.
[149:03.84]He's falling, he's falling, he's falling.
[149:05.66]Oh, fuck.
[149:06.86]This is the end.
[149:10.02]Right there.
[149:12.77]Okay, that's that one.
[149:14.77]Let's keep going.
[149:23.32]I feel like I can get this one done pretty quick.
[149:30.48]Alright, any more stories?
[149:31.76]Any more dreams anybody had?
[149:38.55]Okay.
[149:39.77]We'll get this one.
[149:53.74]We'll do a bracket here.
[149:55.04]This one.
[150:11.59]I don't want to do the, I, no, I'm not doing that one.
[150:14.74]Alright, we'll do this one, and then I'm going to take a break from stories.
[150:23.04]We're going to put some music on.
[150:29.30]Let's go.
[150:36.50]When I was younger, my father would take me to my bedroom door frame and measure my height with a marker once a month that evening.
[150:43.04]I remember waking up on the first of every month, excited that I would be able to see how far I have grown since the previous month.
[150:52.64]Now, as a child, I always had a head larger than my body.
[150:56.96]The doctor said that this is normal for a child of my age and that my body will eventually catch up to the size of my head.
[151:05.15]After a few years, I had finally reached an impasse.
[151:08.25]My head was somewhat normal sized and my full height on the doorframe was a humbling 5 feet 6 inches.
[151:16.14]My father told me that since I was at my later teenage years that my body would stop growing as fast.
[151:22.70]This disappointed me.
[151:24.34]Perhaps I would grow more in a few years.
[151:27.68]13 years later I was sick and tired of it all.
[151:30.12]I tried getting into really good shape, ate super healthy, and even went to a chiropractor to make my back the straightest there is.
[151:38.13]I didn't even get one centimeter.
[151:40.55]Then, just yesterday, I decided to change the formula around.
[151:45.20]I cut my hair short, did stretches all day, listened to Enya, and went to bed super early without measuring my height.
[151:52.49]The next morning I woke up and immediately measured myself.
[151:56.37]I grew 2cm.
[151:58.15]Guys, there's still hope for us short folks out there.
[152:01.61]Keep trying.
[152:03.29]Sky went into Jerma's stream the other day and he was just doing this impression of two viewers talking.
[152:11.13]It was really weird, he would act like one of the viewers had recommended the stream to the other but that that viewer had become disillusioned with the stream after seeing something weird.
[152:21.23]Yeah, it was just strange man.
[152:23.75]Not sure what I expected, but please don't link me to that streamer ever again.
[152:28.81]Thank you.
[152:31.55]Jerma985 wanted to go to the potluck as a member of the community.
[152:37.70]After a lot of back and forth, he got his own pass with a note to the people that were coming for the event.
[152:42.84]I would really appreciate your attendance.
[152:45.96]That was how most of my friends made their way here.
[152:49.28]They came by their friends and told them where to start going.
[152:53.10]It's kind of a shame that the people in charge of keeping the community running don't share that same mindset.
[152:59.31]When asked if he was expecting a big response from his own friends.
[153:04.17]No, I mean, it's not even close.
[153:07.23]We have probably only a couple of hundred people that are showing up to see the first time we put on the event.
[153:13.70]Fucking word soup.
[153:14.34]I wonder who this is.
[153:14.92]That was it.
[153:15.26]I don't know what that story was.
[153:16.24]We're going to go smaller.
[153:17.80]Let's do the red down here.
[153:41.89]No, no, no, not yet.
[153:43.41]What does he look like?
[153:44.51]He's got glasses on, right?
[153:46.97]Glasses first.
[153:47.71]6, 7.
[153:52.98]11, 12, 13.
[153:53.44]14, 15.
[153:57.44]Yeah, these are the shades.
[154:04.78]Free advertisement for another streamer, by the way.
[154:08.04]I don't like to do this.
[154:12.91]Okay, now we've got to go like... No, we can stay here.
[154:23.25]What color is his hair?
[154:25.05]It's brown, right?
[154:31.82]What's the beef?
[154:34.38]Yeah, that comes from his string.
[154:38.40]I know that's his little phrase.
[154:41.17]Whenever he gets into a back and forth with Chad.
[154:45.33]Guys, shut up.
[154:46.93]I can see it.
[154:47.79]I picked up the item already and I combined it with the green herb.
[154:51.05]God, what's the beef?
[154:52.45]And everyone fucking laughs their asses off.
[154:54.77]Wicked fucking funny.
[155:13.73]He wouldn't know comedy if it poo-pooed on him.
[155:17.49]You know what I mean?
[155:17.97]You know what I'm saying?
[155:36.87]Alright, there's the hair.
[155:38.33]Now from 56, 57...
[155:42.07]Where did we go?
[155:46.17]Where's 58?
[155:48.60]Where's 58?
[155:49.22]58?
[155:49.54]Oh, there it is.
[155:59.72]Are you really dissing somebody that helped you on the come up?
[156:06.89]No.
[156:09.11]No.
[156:17.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[156:17.92]Shirt.
[156:18.68]Shirt's red.
[156:21.74]I know everything about this guy.
[156:23.76]I know what color shirts he has.
[156:27.95]I know his comedy schtick routine.
[156:37.73]Eighty-four.
[156:45.18]Eighty-five.
[156:47.88]Alright.
[156:49.80]Looking good, Grillmaster.
[156:53.72]Looking good!
[157:00.57]What happened down here?
[157:01.53]Oh, GM, right.
[157:06.85]The more that Jerma talks, the more I think Grillmaster is the right one.
[157:16.12]I have no fault in that, in the problems that we had.
[157:24.09]Fuck.
[157:25.11]Alright.
[157:26.85]Uh, let's put up some tunes.
[157:28.03]What do you say?
[157:28.79]Some music?
[157:33.94]Wait, right, right.
[157:34.74]I'm an idiot.
[157:35.36]I want to do this.
[157:40.70]Now, if that ain't somebody's new Twitter profile, if it was me and I wanted something very minimalistic and artistic at the same time, like if I was a YouTuber or something, that would probably be what it was.
[157:54.06]except the only difference is put this on like a darker background and have these lines be brighter glowing neon almost like it was a sign you know like a neon sign outside of a bar and then have like gmbb uh bx xq whatever bbxq bb yeah barbecue bbqx well I don't know the fucking whatever his name is
[158:21.27]bbxq bbqx I don't know what his name is grill master x barbecue that's just a kind of funny idea have like a little neon sign of your I don't want him looking at that it's my shit I'm gonna have one of those on like in the back here
[158:52.53]Alright, what about some toons?
[158:53.43]Anybody got any toons?
[158:59.00]I just helped his brand.
[159:00.00]Uh, what do we got for toons?
[159:11.65]NES Pictionary.
[159:13.51]Really?
[159:14.47]Is that fun?
[159:19.76]Pictionary NES?
[159:20.78]Where did this come from?
[159:23.02]Is that seriously a thing you want to hear?
[159:26.20]Pictionary NES.
[159:32.16]I've never heard of this.
[159:40.39]It's a minute long.
[159:46.73]This is a minute long, guys.
[160:01.07]Is this for the regular Nintendo?
[160:06.37]That's pretty good for the regular Nintendo.
[160:08.03]Wait, look at the base!
[160:14.01]Alright, the channel is getting raided.
[160:15.46]Shine the spotlight on the dissenter to make out the outline.
[160:18.68]Let's see.
[160:27.66]Start here one.
[160:29.32]Ooh, this one looks a little complicated.
[160:35.59]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[160:39.75]This better not be, like, a ball sack.
[160:42.81]Where's the 19?
[160:43.83]Oh, 19.
[160:44.01]Where's 19?
[160:44.63]Over here?

[161:09.11]That was good.
[161:09.57]What's next?
[161:10.35]Put on the Ludwig the Holy Blake.
[161:35.38]Yeah.
[161:36.54]Absolutely.
[161:37.88]That is the best song in a video game.
[161:40.92]Just in case anyone had any idea.
[161:51.28]Alright, you want us to lock the fuck in on this one?
[161:53.02]I'm gonna put both headphones in and lock in.

[164:07.07]Thank you.
[164:38.54]This is crab.
[164:39.30]This is Etalyx crab.
[164:41.60]The dissenter is Etalyx.
[164:44.23]Pretty good.
[164:44.65]I should have done it in red.
[164:48.11]That was my mistake.
[164:53.59]This is the goatee.
[164:58.71]You missed 96.
[164:59.73]I didn't miss anything.
[165:00.67]I'm fine.
[165:04.43]That's pretty good.
[165:05.77]That looks good.
[165:11.04]Alright, I don't want to do any spoilers, but I want to see what's left.
[165:18.56]A lot.
[165:20.08]Well, let's hold on.
[165:33.00]No, we're like more than halfway through the dot-to-dots.
[165:36.25]We have like another 15 or so.
[165:41.93]This is fun.
[165:44.01]I'm really enjoying this shit.
[165:51.05]It's just fun to just do this.
[165:54.83]Did you do all the stories?
[165:57.03]Yes, I did most of the stories already.
[165:59.55]Don't you have a plane to catch?
[166:08.50]No, I got plenty of time.
[166:11.91]We have to hear the whole Ludwig song, though, because I ain't gonna go out without the whole entire Ludwig song.
[166:19.28]It's my favorite song.
[166:21.48]So, sorry.
[166:22.98]We're gonna have to fucking listen to it.
[166:31.17]I need a good one.
[166:31.99]Actually, no, not Ludwig.
[166:33.03]We need to have, like, a boppin' song for the next one.
[166:36.83]What's a good boppin' song?
[166:39.15]I need a good one.
[166:51.11]I can't do it.
[166:52.78]Do pluck.
[166:54.26]I feel like I've done pluck.
[167:04.31]We're going to do the pluck beach.
[167:14.56]I don't know.
[167:14.98]I don't want it.
[167:22.85]I'm sorry.
[167:24.03]I've done it before.
[167:24.75]I've done it already.
[167:35.44]Avengers?
[167:36.26]The Avengers theme?
[167:39.86]Hold on.
[167:41.58]The Avengers.
[167:44.02]The one that goes like...
[167:50.27]Why?
[167:51.85]Alright, fine.
[167:52.69]Stream will be boppin' real soon.
[168:10.59]Oh fuck, this whole thing's gonna get claimed!
[168:13.27]Oh no no no, that's a bad idea.
[168:15.67]That's a bad idea.
[168:19.98]I can't do that.
[168:21.06]I can't do anything.
[168:23.14]Anybody have any music they've made recently?
[168:31.78]There's got to be video game related.
[168:33.74]Fuck, did I just really kill my entire VOD because I played 15 seconds of the Avengers theme song?
[168:40.02]Please don't do that.
[168:47.46]Metal Gear Solid... No, you know what I want?
[168:51.45]I want the Metal Gear 5 theme song.
[168:56.93]Is this claimed?
[168:57.57]This is in the game, right?
[169:07.10]Right?
[169:07.40]It is, right?
[169:07.94]This is in the game?

[170:23.97]I think he has an extra finger.
[170:29.70]But that's alright.
[170:31.38]It's okay.
[170:42.81]That's great.
[170:43.77]Connect the dots from 1 to 80 and this page will be boppin'!
[170:46.51]It already is.
[170:47.57]It already is.
[170:48.59]What's next?
[170:49.15]Dear Jerma, I've drawn your face so many times, it's time for you to draw mine!
[171:12.89]Wait, this is your face.
[171:17.70]It's time for you to draw my face.
[171:22.68]This is your face.
[171:27.40]Alright, let's do it.
[171:34.21]Where do we start?

[173:36.98]Ah, it looks ugly.
[173:40.90]I screwed it up.
[173:41.42]38.
[173:51.12]Where's 38?
[173:53.68]I don't want to drink any more coffee.
[173:56.01]What am I doing?
[173:57.09]It's a mistake.
[174:05.12]40, 38, right there.
[174:05.72]38, 39, 40, 41.
[174:05.80]Ah, that's a- nah, that's ugly.
[174:07.88]39, 40, 41.
[174:07.94]42?

[176:06.57]Use a ruler.
[176:14.59]Why would I use a ruler?
[176:17.20]When I was like 12 years old, I didn't use a ruler.
[176:20.32]I did it with my hand.
[176:25.10]I'm not gonna use the line tool.
[176:27.58]You do dot to dot with your hand.
[176:29.23]Why would I use the line tool?
[176:31.59]This is cheating.
[176:32.25]And by the way, you gotta pay to use the line tool.
[176:43.06]62, 63... 64, 65... Here's the ear.
[176:43.88]Oh boy, this is gonna be tricky in this one.

[178:05.06]Bald!
[178:08.71]That's pretty good.
[178:10.45]That's pretty good.
[178:11.19]I mean, there's a little bit of issue over here.
[178:14.00]But that's pretty good.
[178:20.76]That's awesome.
[178:22.82]Good shit.
[178:23.71]Good shit.
[178:24.15]Alright, we need some new music here.
[178:29.29]I can't take, like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun anymore.
[178:32.97]As much as I love it.
[178:45.67]Metal Gear Solid.
[178:47.27]Pokémon.
[178:50.29]Katamari.
[178:58.55]Persona 5.
[178:59.13]I've never played Persona.
[179:01.19]I don't want to get spoiled on the music because I ever decided to play that game, which I probably won't.
[179:06.85]Jet Set Radio.
[179:07.59]That's not a bad one.
[179:11.75]Celeste.
[179:13.21]Celeste has good music.
[179:14.73]Yeah, let's just put Celeste on.
[179:17.70]There's some good music in Celeste.
[179:25.80]It worked.
[179:26.26]What worked?
[179:28.55]Putting on good fucking OSTs?
[179:29.71]Guys, this is the chill stream before I leave to the carnival.
[179:38.55]Somebody got scammed.
[179:39.27]Who got scammed?
[179:39.87]Don't get scammed.
[179:41.83]Never give anybody your fucking credit card number.
[179:43.85]Unless you're paying for something on Amazon.
[179:45.31]Alright, let's go.
[179:50.92]Clear it.
[179:52.14]Good stuff.
[180:04.32]Surprise!
[180:04.84]A new friend in the Jerma Funhouse.
[180:06.24]Who could it possibly be?
[180:07.46]Let's form bonds with him and find out.
[180:09.36]Shoot him 205 times with your laser pointer.
[180:13.85]I do appreciate that it's color-coded.
[180:18.27]It is... It's color-coded.
[180:19.61]Where are we starting?
[180:24.62]One with blue.
[180:28.62]Right?
[180:30.58]Wait, this is a different blue.
[180:31.84]I need a darker blue?
[180:37.38]Gotta be a thicker line for that one.
[180:40.05]Why am I putting this much time into this?
[180:42.13]Why do I care about this?
[180:43.45]Everyone knows what this is.
[180:44.17]It's already done.
[180:44.67]The thing's already completed in front of you.
[180:46.75]Wait a minute.
[181:05.96]Why is it a different color?
[181:06.76]No, it should be the same color.
[181:15.89]Okay, let's go thinner.
[181:16.73]I'm gonna do the beard.
[181:23.63]Is this the gnome?
[181:28.41]Why am I even asking that fucking question?
[181:29.68]I know the answer to it already.
[181:35.74]Can we just pretend I did this one?
[181:42.57]It's a gnome.
[181:43.31]It's like the who thing.
[181:45.12]No.

[185:34.68]Alright, here we go.
[185:35.08]Let's just start it.
[185:37.66]I don't ignore people.
[185:45.21]Oh, it's the chin thing.
[185:53.27]Of course it is.
[186:02.23]Down here.
[186:03.23]Wrap the hair around.
[186:04.21]This one has high detail.
[186:12.80]I like it.
[186:13.16]I pretty much liked all of them.
[186:18.40]They've all been pretty good.
[186:27.13]39 40 by the way if you're looking for these if you want to do this just for fun uh all of these are in that Discord already right now if you go to the doctor dot section if they're just there there's like 40 of them 50 of them alright this is where it gets I gotta focus on this one because this is where the detail comes in with this is like a whole hand alright here we go
[187:03.60]Alright, so that's that, and then it comes... I got kind of a fucked up finger there a little bit, I guess.
[187:15.74]Whoa!
[187:19.28]We'll go all the way up?
[187:21.69]This is a big square!
[187:24.13]All the way?
[187:42.28]This is a big picture, a big painting.
[187:45.10]This is fucking awesome.
[187:49.20]But what is this a painting of?
[188:12.21]Alright, I gotta start to actually... 80, what the fuck is this?
[188:21.11]Down here, up here, is this an ear?
[188:49.41]Really good connections on this one.
[188:53.66]The way that the lines don't cross and everything is very, very well, very well made.
[189:04.56]Wait, slow it down.
[189:05.26]93.
[189:06.00]Here.
[189:20.18]And then across to 104.
[189:21.22]Up here, down... So this is like a... Did I make this?
[189:28.85]Wait, 112 then turns into... Oh, 113.
[189:33.49]114.
[189:33.51]115. 115.
[189:50.21]What in the name of God is this?
[190:03.96]It's one of my paintings from that painting game.
[190:08.70]Oh, okay.
[190:18.40]Oh, that's right, it's on the phone!
[190:21.97]That's right!
[190:22.95]I forgot about that.
[190:23.83]This one was great.
[190:25.91]That was awesome.
[190:27.09]Let's get the white on it.
[190:57.24]Although, without the actual internal detail.
[191:01.60]You still actually can tell what's going on here, though.
[191:04.52]It kind of looks like a sandcastle that I built.
[191:08.08]And I'm very proud of it.
[191:14.47]That's awesome.
[191:16.05]The chin is spot on, too.
[191:17.45]It is.
[191:22.41]Nice.
[191:23.77]Good work!
[191:30.92]Dermot, please play Pikmin 3.
[191:32.56]It's only 20 bucks on the Wii U eShop, and I think you'd like it.
[191:35.70]The Wii U eShop is closed forever.
[191:39.36]Isn't it?
[191:46.70]Am I wrong?
[191:47.36]I'm not wrong.
[191:48.99]That looks good right there.
[191:51.15]So are these Pikmins?
[191:53.07]Do I have to do different colors for different Pikmins?
[192:02.18]It's a blue and red and a yellow Pikmin, right?
[192:04.50]Let's start over here.
[192:06.02]I'm going to say this one's red.
[192:07.96]This is the red Pikmin over here, I'm going to guess.
[192:10.03]That's probably wrong, but I'm still going to do it.
[192:12.47]Because this is where I have to start.
[192:13.39]Here we go, start over.
[192:25.70]Is this a Pikmin?
[192:30.40]Oh, it's definitely a Pikmin.
[192:31.39]Yeah, it is.
[192:32.75]Alright, now I gotta do... Back to black here.
[192:49.82]Two... Is this a beetle or is this Pikmi... Is this... Is there... I think this is purple.
[192:56.63]I'm 99% certain this is purple.
[192:59.31]Purple's a big fat one, right?
[193:04.31]There is no purple here.
[193:05.23]Yeah, there is.
[193:05.71]Kind of.
[193:07.11]Sort of.
[193:09.76]Get some Undertale music?
[193:10.68]We'll do Undertale next.
[193:16.02]Thank you everybody.
[193:16.64]I don't think I even said this, but thanks everybody for even contributing any of these.
[193:21.25]I wanted to find something that we could just do for fun for like the day before I left.
[193:26.17]And this has been a lot of fun.
[193:27.53]It's been just cool just to see what you guys come up with.
[193:29.41]So thank you for contributing these things.
[193:33.36]It's good shit.
[193:33.92]Thank you.
[193:37.00]Now where do we go?
[193:37.52]29.
[193:37.64]And then this is a big circle.
[194:00.15]46, 47, and then we go down here.
[194:01.97]50.
[194:02.15]Alright, I do have to ask, though.
[194:08.78]Is Pikmin actually really, really a really good game to play on stream?
[194:14.02]Should I stream Pikmin?
[194:16.96]What do you guys think?
[194:21.69]I have played Pikmin before, but not in a very, very long time.
[194:28.97]It's not a really good stream game.
[194:30.25]A lot of people are saying yes, but still.
[194:31.97]Is this a different Pikmin?
[194:35.79]Okay, I'm going to go with yellow.
[194:36.63]63, 4, 5.
[194:36.69]66 right here.
[194:39.01]80, 81.
[194:39.09]This is a cute little picture.
[195:06.89]Alright, now this is the fruit.
[195:18.41]This is a blue Pikmin.
[195:19.97]Oh, I fucked it up?
[195:22.96]Shit.
[195:24.20]It's alright.
[195:24.64]You can just use your imagination.
[195:25.74]This one, I don't know what color that one is.
[195:28.15]It has like a horn.
[195:30.05]So the other horn... This is probably blue.
[195:34.01]And if it's not, then I'm sorry.
[195:35.09]I've ruined everything.
[195:36.27]14, 15, 16, 17, 18...
[195:52.12]19 I'm gonna go like this too you know what let's just let's finish it ah there we go 24 25 26 27 28 oh this is this is part of red
[196:22.03]Let me get to here.
[196:32.96]Look at that!
[196:41.21]I kinda wanna... That looks cool.
[196:47.37]Is that a berry?
[196:48.03]Did you pick up berries in that game?
[196:52.74]Ever thought of doing a drawing pad with a computer?
[196:54.44]No.
[196:56.12]I don't.
[196:57.22]I'm not very artistic.
[196:58.46]I can't do stuff like that.
[197:00.63]What you see with me with the mouse is as good as I can do with a pen in my hand.
[197:04.71]So no, that wouldn't help.
[197:06.75]I would just spend money on a tablet just for no reason.
[197:11.57]Am I colorblind?
[197:13.18]No.
[197:15.42]No, I'm not.
[197:17.30]Is that some kind of fucking joke?
[197:18.96]Trying to make it me and my expense?
[197:21.83]Alright, let's go!
[197:22.85]That was a good one too.
[197:25.13]I think we're nearing the end of the Dot to Dots and then we're at the pretty much, we're at big meaty stuff at that point.
[197:33.94]We're gonna need rock music.
[197:37.64]This is the relaxing portion of the stream.
[197:41.30]Hopefully, maybe if you've got a fireplace.
[197:45.46]Don't use it because it's summertime.
[197:46.86]So, just open a window.
[197:49.63]Alright, scoff at him.
[197:51.01]I made this.
[197:56.58]Wait, is this Lightning Man?
[197:59.88]This is definitely Lightning Man.
[198:01.90]Without a doubt.
[198:05.86]We gotta do broader strokes than that.
[198:08.79]Lightning Man deserves better.
[198:17.31]Yeah, this is Lightning Man.
[198:22.48]Or Gatorade Man.
[198:46.50]I love it.
[198:49.01]Scoff at him.
[198:51.33]There's a whole- no, it's not sponsored.
[198:52.80]I don't drink Gatorade.
[198:57.96]There's a whole family of little people that are lightning-based, fire-based, they're all elemental-based.
[199:03.64]We could have a whole elemental family.
[199:06.38]In fact, maybe one day.
[199:12.47]Introducing Jerma the Frog.
[199:15.33]Hey guys, can you fill me in?
[199:16.59]Connect the dots and color inside the lines.
[199:22.06]Alright, frog's going to have to be green.
[199:27.31]Let's do the smaller one.
[199:29.67]I'm going to have to pull it back just a hair.
[199:33.63]I zoomed it in too far.
[199:34.99]Oh, wow.
[199:36.91]Okay.
[199:41.40]This one's going to be tricky.
[199:43.62]I promised Undertale music after this.
[199:45.52]After this one.
[199:47.88]Alright, this is an ear portion of the stream here.
[200:13.14]20, 21, 22, 23.
[200:21.30]Actually pretty clean to do this.
[200:24.20]This is actually fairly clean.
[200:26.74]I thought I got overwhelmed by the amount of numbers, but no, they're very much tightly knit together to go through them.
[200:31.08]36, 37.
[200:38.69]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[200:39.37]Don't go that easy.
[200:40.85]Don't predict where it's supposed to go.
[200:42.23]Follow the rule.
[200:42.93]41.
[200:44.45]There it is.
[200:45.35]45.
[200:45.37]Alright.
[200:50.78]Let me squint in here.
[200:55.50]I definitely have like a fucking... I definitely have nerd neck right now.
[201:03.81]Sometimes you need to do full nerd neck to be able to get what you want to have done.
[201:27.51]Oh, that's the full foot!
[201:31.39]Nerd neck.
[201:37.59]Oh shit, no no no no no no.
[201:39.14]I almost just blew the whole thing.
[201:43.16]71, 72.
[201:43.34]Alright, more finesse work with the hands here.
[201:50.18]What's 77?
[201:56.44]What's 77?
[201:57.08]75, 76.
[201:58.02]What's 77?
[201:58.20]77.
[201:58.26]Is there a 77?
[202:00.15]Do you guys see a 77?
[202:01.83]I don't see a 77.
[202:15.47]Alright, we'll go with 78.
[202:16.11]That feels good.
[202:16.55]To do that.
[202:16.81]Alright, almost at 100.
[202:45.73]Oh, three.
[202:46.49]Then from here, we're doing the arm?
[202:48.55]The second part of the arm?
[202:52.25]Connect the dots.
[202:52.98]La la la la la.
[202:53.74]What's la la la?
[202:54.20]That's a really great made-up sentence.
[203:17.23]And then from here we'll be wrapping around this one time right here Hey Oh
[203:42.83]It's just like traversing water.
[203:45.21]I'm just trying to navigate my boat.
[203:47.59]To the right spot.
[203:56.71]It's 31, 32, 33... 34!
[204:04.16]Almost done, time to go to the head.
[204:05.36]Alright, this is where it gets tricky.
[204:11.28]I think I fucked something up here.
[204:16.53]Was it too long?
[204:20.99]Watch it.
[204:22.85]Easy.
[204:23.13]44, 45, 46, Jesus.
[204:46.14]8, 9, 60, oof!
[204:50.54]Ugh, I gotta take a second.
[204:53.36]We're 63, right here.
[204:54.16]6, 67, 68, 69, 70, ooh, we're closing it.
[204:59.05]5, 76, 77, 78, 79!
[205:12.86]The hair part comes right down to the middle, that's cool.
[205:17.55]80.
[205:20.17]Back up to 81.
[205:25.45]85, 86, 87 to the end.
[205:30.88]How am I doing?
[205:31.56]I'm doing good, how are you?
[205:32.40]How are you doing?
[205:34.20]Hope you're doing well.
[205:38.66]That one was elaborate, let's see what it looks like.
[205:53.28]I mean, if I did that by hand, I'm not sure I could do a better job.
[205:57.62]What's the music?
[205:58.04]This is the Celeste OST.
[206:01.59]That's good enough, yeah.
[206:04.81]Good shit.
[206:08.05]Let's clear it.
[206:08.61]Thank you for that.
[206:09.13]Am I a fan of frogs?
[206:13.07]I mean, yes.
[206:14.45]I do like frogs a lot.
[206:18.06]Connect the dots.
[206:18.68]I know what this one's gonna be.
[206:21.67]We have to do the Jerma985 Jerma color, which I don't think they really, they don't have it.
[206:25.90]It's like this one or this one.
[206:29.70]Which one's closer?
[206:30.76]I mean, probably this one.
[206:31.74]Unfortunately, I don't have the lighter version of this green.
[206:36.82]Maybe this one.
[206:41.24]Connect the dots.
[206:59.33]That was one stroke.
[207:00.27]Alright, now this is the, we're getting into the heart, not yet.
[207:05.53]No, not yet.
[207:05.95]29, 30, 31, here we go.
[207:06.39]Complete the J.
[207:11.35]39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.
[207:31.31]Very cute.
[207:37.73]We don't even need the other one.
[207:38.65]Can we get more emotes of the J?
[207:41.95]It's a good character design.
[207:43.69]It is a really good character design.
[207:45.69]I give all that credit to Blordow, because they made that.
[207:53.62]I said, this is kind of what I'm looking for.
[207:55.34]And he was like, let's go.
[207:58.00]And he made an awesome fucking little character.
[208:01.31]It's a J, yeah, it's a J. Alright, I did promise that I was going to put on Undertale, so let's do it.
[208:12.16]I did promise.
[208:14.86]Who's that famous Hollywood movie star?
[208:16.82]Hint, it's not me.
[208:17.76]Alright, let's put on... Let's change this to... What do you want to put it on?
[208:23.06]Let's put on...
[208:34.72]Who could it be?
[208:35.50]I don't want to listen to the whole Undertale soundtrack because the soundtrack is so good in Undertale that it's gonna make me like sad when I hear like the sad songs.
[208:56.08]We'll do the boss themes.
[209:03.33]Yeah, I don't want to get sad right now.
[209:05.55]It's a very emotional soundtrack sometimes.
[209:13.64]Alright, I know who this is.
[209:15.14]I'm surprised more of you don't know.
[209:37.48]This is gonna be tricky.
[209:38.24]Hold on, I'm gonna come down with it.
[209:46.83]No, redo the whole damn thing with a thicker pen.
[210:13.72]Oh, it's OK.
[210:14.06]I got it.
[210:18.12]Cheeto.
[210:18.82]Very cute.
[210:22.62]I like it.
[210:44.81]Good stuff.
[210:46.77]Oh wait, actually, let's see.
[210:47.63]Let's look at it with the, uh, without... Let's put it on the scanner.
[210:59.20]Very nice.
[211:25.73]It looks kind of like... I don't know.
[211:30.76]I'm not gonna take a guess yet.
[211:32.84]I need to get some, uh... I need to get in there.
[211:36.24]Starting at the bottom.
[211:42.22]It's obviously me.
[211:46.59]But are you looking at me?
[211:53.85]I wonder.
[212:08.82]If you're not looking at me, then what are you doing? 30.
[212:38.43]That's what it is.
[212:38.97]I love it.
[212:42.09]Alright, 41.
[212:45.07]Down here.
[212:45.55]Uh oh, did I blow it up?
[213:05.68]No, I think I got it still.
[213:18.37]That's awesome.
[213:22.53]The one of four moves that I do on camera whenever I have a fucking facecam on.
[213:29.71]I'm either gonna go like, look at me, look at me, or I'm gonna go like, hey, let me tell you about this.
[213:35.02]It's my go-to.
[213:36.56]When I'm out of things to say.
[213:39.59]You can always tell, because I'm gonna go, what about this?
[213:46.09]Oh, by the way, best song on the OST?
[214:12.12]You blank that one, blank another.
[214:15.30]Let me see if I can get this.
[214:30.23]I think I got it.
[214:30.93]I solved it.
[214:34.03]Alright, let's get in there.
[214:37.05]Where do we start?
[214:37.91]This is the barrel.
[214:40.64]Not the barrel.
[214:41.70]Not the barrel.
[214:42.32]The bottle.
[214:43.98]Say it what it is.
[214:45.63]No, he's not holding a drumstick.
[214:47.59]That's a bottle.
[214:51.65]Alright, let's go... We're starting over here.
[215:02.35]20, 21.
[215:02.67]Alright, I think we have to take the pencil off here.
[215:04.57]22 is right here.
[215:13.66]29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35... 38, 39, 50, 51, 52, 53!
[215:14.46]That's actually a pretty good hat!
[215:16.68]That ended at... 60? 61?
[215:52.36]73, 74, 75, 76, 77.
[215:52.54]Throwing up a bottle.
[215:54.64]And then this is the explosion.
[215:56.44]70, started at 78, right?
[215:57.78]Yeah.
[215:57.92]78, 79. 80.
[216:14.09]82... 83... 84... 85... 86... Oh, wait!
[216:16.04]It's up there.
[216:19.82]I can still get it.
[216:23.20]87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93...
[216:45.83]Where's 94?
[216:46.07]In the middle.
[216:49.92]Must not.
[216:50.32]Where's 94?
[216:50.52]Is that it?
[216:54.76]Wait, that's it?
[216:57.46]Like that?
[216:58.10]That's it, right?
[217:04.42]There you go.
[217:07.19]Now this one, we don't need the screen for it, because this obviously is a great artwork on here, the show.
[217:13.53]You missed 94.
[217:13.95]Try another.
[217:18.15]I like the little explosion.
[217:19.47]That's cool.
[217:21.77]Didn't we already hear this one?
[217:22.78]Skip it.
[217:26.24]I like the touch here with adding the little activity like, oh, can you guess the word?
[217:29.74]I like it.
[217:31.52]What do you mean don't skip it?
[217:34.32]I'm skipping it.
[217:37.74]You can hear the end.
[217:38.27]There you go.
[217:44.03]This is called the hint.
[217:45.13]This is called it's a goon.
[217:58.83]One is this sans Well No, that was shitty Uh, I guess we're going all the way around
[218:32.02]It is the whole thing, so... What the fuck?
[218:52.81]Hold on.
[219:08.92]18 not alright 20 21 22 was eyebrow And from here we got to go to here without touching anything Right I guess
[219:44.19]And then down to 27?
[219:49.30]29, where's 30?
[220:19.75]Am I doing this right?
[220:20.69]I guess.
[220:29.64]44, where's 4?
[220:29.96]I'm looking for 45.
[220:30.44]Down... Down here!
[220:52.39]Not bad, 46.
[220:52.73]47.
[220:52.81]48, 49.
[220:52.85]Does anybody have any idea what this is?
[221:22.39]Is this Peter?
[221:23.21]This has been my sister's ringtone since 2015.
[221:27.01]Looking for 54.
[221:35.63]Right here?
[221:40.14]How do I get the fuck up there?
[221:44.16]54, 55.
[222:10.78]Is that 63?
[222:11.14]I think that's 63 up here.
[222:13.70]And then 64, 65.
[222:42.93]60, is this 68?
[222:45.99]No, it's over there.
[222:57.26]Wait, 64 is down here!
[222:58.90]62, 63, 64?! !
[223:08.98]65 66 67 68 Where's 69?
[223:09.44]Oh 70 I'm just gonna go for it.
[223:11.94]Oops.
[223:52.77]What is this?
[223:56.09]Is this just a goon?
[223:57.17]I think it's just...
[224:18.14]I don't know what this is.
[224:21.02]Is it Sans?
[224:21.98]No.
[224:23.88]Well, whatever it is.
[224:27.74]Interesting.
[224:28.44]Interesting line decision.
[224:34.94]I feel like I needed a ruler with this one.
[224:39.94]Alright, I need some new music.
[224:43.10]He hates it.
[224:43.84]What?
[224:45.22]What are you talking about?
[224:46.30]I just said an interesting fucking line work.
[224:49.56]Here it is.
[224:52.97]Wait, let me see.
[225:01.81]Oh, I've never seen this before.
[225:10.35]Let's skip to... How about... Hotline Miami is not a bad idea.
[225:21.82]How about... What's like the... Oh, I forgot to tell you guys.
[225:26.94]This is really important.
[225:28.38]I forgot.
[225:30.21]So I played... This has nothing to do with anything that we're doing right now today.
[225:34.53]I played the first hour and a half or so of God of War, the new one.
[225:43.26]That might be the best first hour of any video game I've ever played in my whole life.
[225:51.97]That initial few fights might be the coolest thing I've ever seen in a video game.
[225:57.39]The first hour and a half.
[225:58.93]You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[226:02.53]It was un-fucking-believable.
[226:04.50]And I can't believe I didn't even try to play this game two years ago when it came out.
[226:14.96]Why don't I play it on stream?
[226:21.10]I don't know, because I feel like I just kind of wanted to play it and just sit back and go... Sometimes you want to do that with a video game, you know?
[226:34.29]You can do that.
[226:35.47]I could do that here.
[226:37.19]He hates us.
[226:41.09]I still have, like, the goon on screen.
[226:44.04]I need a new OST.
[226:45.68]Wait, let me just take a look and see how many we got left on the dot-to-dots.
[226:50.89]We have... Alright, we have like six dot-to-dots remaining, and then we gotta get into the fucking hard shit.
[227:15.61]Put on the Fullmetal Alchemist OST.
[227:17.37]I can't... I don't want this stream to get claimed.
[227:18.79]This is a comfy stream.
[227:19.73]I don't want to... I want people to be able to watch this VOD if they feel like it.
[227:22.51]And I want it to be a comfortable stream.
[227:31.78]We'll do Hotline in Miami.
[227:32.98]That's a good one.
[227:42.02]Um...
[227:46.48]That's kind of odd.
[227:49.04]When I typed in Hotline Miami, the thumbnail is still sands and papyrus.
[227:53.76]That was strange.
[228:06.29]Yeah, this is pretty good.
[228:07.19]This is good.
[228:08.79]Alright, here we go.
[228:09.27]Let's go back to it.
[228:09.87]We only got about five or six more of these.
[228:12.67]I like this one already.
[228:14.15]I don't even know what it is.
[228:15.03]I have no idea what this one is.
[228:19.89]It could be anything.
[228:25.87]Your enemy in the digital age.
[228:27.57]Jerma says, who ruins the stream when the connection goes bad?
[228:32.50]I couldn't guess.
[228:33.62]Oh wait, it's already there.
[228:57.83]I'm doing this pretty sloppy, but, you know.
[229:00.33]It's alright.
[229:02.07]Because I'm trying to hold it.
[229:03.80]That's why I don't have face cams on, by the way.
[229:05.46]You just saw it in real time why I don't do this.
[229:14.38]Don't summon it.
[229:15.00]21, 22... 24, 25, 26...
[229:31.17]Who is it?
[229:34.53]It's Cox.
[229:41.04]I like this down here.
[229:41.84]My arm is a little bigger though.
[229:52.73]Chest is a little bit bigger than that.
[229:55.83]I got like a little, my neck is a little thicker too.
[229:59.66]Got a bigger breast too over there.
[230:00.88]This is a little bigger.
[230:02.76]This is bigger down here as well.
[230:06.98]This is a little bit bigger.
[230:07.84]I got a big fucking brain in there.
[230:12.59]Perfect.
[230:15.07]Good shit.
[230:17.25]Cock sucks.
[230:25.03]What's that in the bush?
[230:27.99]I know what it is.
[230:37.72]Let's do it over here.
[230:38.70]1, 2, 3.
[230:38.78]It's the slug.
[230:39.65]29 into 30.
[230:39.83]1, 32, 33.
[230:39.89]Nice.
[231:08.12]That one was clean.
[231:08.84]That one was a one stroker.
[231:12.34]Just gotta go here.
[231:14.94]Up around.
[231:15.64]It's beautiful.
[231:17.52]He looks so happy.
[231:20.38]Because he is.
[231:22.08]Turn the volume up.
[231:23.44]You got it.
[231:30.30]Good shit.
[231:38.95]This one.
[231:39.49]Jerma.
[231:40.99]You need to help Otto find the location of Otto's Adventure 3.
[231:46.35]Line start and stop at... Alamander just gave five community subs.
[231:50.99]Thank you for the five subs.
[231:54.11]Five drop right now.
[231:55.63]Thank you.
[231:57.07]Appreciate that.
[231:59.65]You need to help find Otto.
[232:03.47]Lines start and stop between 1 and 4, lines stop.
[232:06.75]Okay.
[232:08.25]I'm going to go just piece by piece here.
[232:09.49]This one has some very specific directions.
[232:11.27]1 through 4, lines start and stop.
[232:19.39]Like that.
[232:20.45]Okay.
[232:21.31]5 through 12 is start and stop.
[232:25.66]So up here.
[232:29.34]I think this is Otto's dog bowl.
[232:35.74]13 through 91.
[232:36.36]13 through 91.
[232:36.70]So from here is one line to 91.
[232:40.96]6, 7...
[233:03.15]I missed 31.
[233:03.65]Come on.
[233:04.63]You can do better than that, dude.
[233:05.49]Come on.
[233:08.37]31.
[233:08.89]32.
[233:08.91]37.
[233:08.97]This is the tail.
[233:24.18]I know I'm... It's alright.
[233:27.50]Alright, so to 91.
[233:28.66]We're going to do all of it, all the way around.
[233:34.21]Ooh, nice leg.
[233:48.29]Good work on the leg.
[233:49.46]That's tricky to do that.
[233:54.10]All the way down here.
[234:06.80]72... 73... Is there perspective on this?
[234:12.76]What is... This is perspective.
[234:14.06]It's... I think there's perspective on here.
[234:16.76]Is it looking this way or this way?
[234:31.71]Wait, I'm gonna do that cleaner.
[234:40.98]Big circle.
[234:41.39]89, 90, 91.
[234:41.45]Oh, shit.
[234:41.83]That's awesome.
[234:42.39]92 to 96.
[235:13.50]And then 97 to 104.
[235:51.99]And then 105 to 108.
[235:52.69]Hyper-realistic dog butthole!
[236:20.34]Alright, so I'm supposed to find the location of Otto's Adventure 3.
[236:26.33]In here?
[236:31.89]That's a full-on... This is so good.
[236:36.97]It's so good.
[236:42.26]That is... That is what my dog's butthole looks like.
[236:47.69]That's what it looks like.
[236:48.99]I don't know how you got that detail so correct.
[236:56.86]Next song?
[236:57.50]Oh yeah, this is another song.
[236:58.68]Is this a 10-hour version of this?
[237:03.54]Oh, this is my favorite song.
[237:04.78]The one that goes like... This is the one.
[237:18.35]Alright, let's take a look with the screen on it.
[237:26.02]It's a nice like fried egg butthole.
[237:34.57]That's awesome.
[237:36.15]Good work!
[238:07.65]Alright, I'm gonna say, uh, is it a mouse?
[238:17.94]It's Goofy from McDonald's.
[238:19.80]Speedrun this one?
[238:22.56]Good luck.
[238:23.26]I don't think I- I'll try.
[238:45.46]This is too dark.
[238:46.18]I need to go darker than that.
[239:03.55]16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[239:03.99]22, 23, 24, 25.
[239:04.13]Up here.
[239:04.55]27.
[239:04.63]Did they share it?
[239:05.93]They're sharing a bubble.
[239:16.68]7, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.
[239:17.12]46, 47, 48, 49, and then 50.
[239:17.70]Back again.
[239:18.24]51, 52.
[239:18.42]Is this the Chuck E. Cheese rap?
[239:23.82]Who is this?
[239:24.78]This is like from Chuck E. Cheese or something?
[239:55.20]63... 64... Faster, faster!
[239:58.68]I don't know where 64 is!
[239:59.43]64, where is it?
[239:59.87]64!
[239:59.89]It's right down here.
[240:00.37]65, down here.
[240:00.63]Back up to 66!
[240:01.11]67, 68... 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 66, 67, 69...
[240:30.71]91, 92, 93, 94.
[240:31.09]95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
[240:31.53]101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110.
[240:31.91]Bad.
[240:32.27]112. 113.
[241:16.14]One-twenty-one.
[241:18.67]One-twenty-three.
[241:23.13]One-twenty-four, one-twenty-five.
[241:29.38]Is this cat in the hat?
[241:33.14]Is it?
[241:33.90]No.
[241:35.98]One-twenty-three, twenty-four, I need twenty-five.
[241:46.62]Right here.
[241:46.88]26, 1, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, done!
[242:15.52]It's a cat.
[242:17.42]Of some sort.
[242:22.40]It's a Swedish cartoon character.
[242:24.42]What was the character's name?
[242:28.76]Is this just ripped from an actual Connect the Dots book?
[242:31.88]This is from a Swedish children's book.
[242:35.06]So somebody just copied and pasted a Swedish children's book highlights activity book section.
[242:43.45]Oh.
[242:45.03]I guess that makes sense.
[242:51.87]It's pretty good, though!
[242:53.61]Nice job!
[242:55.01]His name is Findus.
[242:57.01]Is it Findus or Findus?
[243:00.89]Good shit.
[243:11.15]Before you begin, make sure to draw your...
[243:15.99]Make sure you draw a face in the circle.
[243:21.09]This one has 181.
[243:23.19]Why does it say O-W-O?
[243:31.09]O-W-O, what's that?
[243:31.97]Why do you have that here?
[243:36.63]Is this a skip?
[243:37.57]Is this a skip scenario?
[243:42.73]Is this a skip scenario?
[243:45.25]There's a dick.
[243:47.70]Skip, skip, skip.
[243:48.88]I need certainty here.
[243:52.30]This is a tail.
[243:54.04]Is this a Dragon Ball character?
[243:56.78]To me, this is a Dragon Ball Z character or a hyper evolved Pokémon that is intelligent and can talk to people.
[244:04.39]I've never seen either one of those two things.
[244:07.23]Hyper evolved Pokémon that can speak or a Dragon Ball Z character.
[244:20.05]It has my face on it.
[244:21.43]Alright, well, I'm gonna... What?
[244:39.26]What?
[244:46.66]No, guys, you're wrong.
[244:47.90]It's not...
[244:49.35]I'm going for it.
[244:51.15]I'm getting baited here to not do this one.
[245:17.88]He's so stupid.
[245:18.82]Don't do this.
[245:19.46]Why?
[245:48.21]You guys are freaking me out.
[245:50.37]You guys are freaking me out right now.
[245:52.47]It's clearly just a person standing here.
[245:54.47]It's just somebody standing.
[246:03.78]It's 29.
[246:19.62]This is just a hand sitting like this on his side.
[246:22.16]This is just... Yeah, this is not... What's wrong with this?
[246:33.08]This is just a... It's like a... It's a rat.
[246:36.72]This is a rat?
[246:37.48]This is me.
[246:38.56]This is my rat... I don't know.
[246:40.30]This is my sleep paralysis demon.
[246:49.17]That's just a rat.
[247:02.85]That's just a rat standing there like a superhero.
[247:05.27]It's a rat superhero.
[247:07.59]Donald Duck doesn't wear pants, guys.
[247:08.87]What's wrong with what you're talking about?
[247:11.69]When's the last time you saw Donald Duck wear a pair of fucking underwear?
[247:27.26]He doesn't.
[247:27.62]He wears a t-shirt.
[247:30.56]And by the way, what a sicko.
[247:32.62]You wear a t-shirt, but you don't wear pants.
[247:35.10]Why not just have him have no clothes on?
[247:37.17]No, he's be... Oh yeah, I got a t-shirt on.
[247:39.73]That's it.
[247:47.46]Uh, thanks for that.
[247:48.56]That was... Alright.
[247:53.62]There's instructions here.
[247:56.24]Let's see if we can get it all on there.
[247:57.52]We can.
[248:00.12]The Shito.
[248:02.43]This one says... When you see the pencil icon, pick the pencil up and look for the next number.
[248:10.63]Nice instructions.
[248:11.31]I appreciate it.
[248:13.18]Some numbers are diagonally close to each other and have the same star.
[248:16.30]Good to know.
[248:16.82]Okay.
[248:19.49]Alright, so... I'm gonna go with... Uh, what color should I do?
[248:24.84]It's a hay, so I'm talking.
[248:27.52]It's a Shito.
[248:33.10]Let's just go with black.
[248:34.80]And I'll keep that same line.
[248:36.23]Same one.
[248:37.35]Start at one.
[248:37.77]If you see a pencil, it means pick it up.
[248:56.37]13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[249:10.35]I see a pencil.
[249:11.35]Wait a minute.
[249:12.91]Should I pick it up from here?
[249:13.87]Or is that 32?
[249:14.53]I think that's 32.
[249:16.19]Yeah, that's 32.
[249:16.59]Pick the pencil up.
[249:33.52]6, 7, 8, 29, 30, 31, 32.
[249:36.02]Pick up the pencil.
[249:40.62]Okay.
[249:41.22]So then 33 is over here.
[249:44.53]34 is the same one as 6.
[250:06.78]Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight.
[250:09.32]Thirty-nine.
[250:10.32]Forty-eight.
[250:11.52]Forty-five.
[250:12.84]Forty-six, forty-seven.
[250:14.48]Pick up the pencil.
[250:15.20]Forty-eight.
[250:15.76]Forty-nine.
[250:16.62]Fifty, fifty-one.
[250:40.14]52 pick up the pencil wait is it it I did it wait 53 54 55 56 what is it
[251:07.39]It's a toilet, but... What do you mean it's a... I don't... But what do you mean it's a toilet?
[251:13.68]What is it?
[251:14.72]Is this... Does it mean legs?
[251:33.46]My toilet tweet.
[251:35.78]Hey!
[251:52.46]I have a new tweet now, so that doesn't work anymore.
[252:02.77]I thought it was a rat's face going like, like up, you know what I mean?
[252:07.46]I thought it was, here's the rat's mouth, rat's nose, and eyes, and just lying back going like this.
[252:15.06]With his hands, but it's like legs down.
[252:18.84]These are his legs right here.
[252:20.26]Legs, legs, mouth open, nose.
[252:22.96]That's just, ah, that's fucked up.
[252:32.26]Thank you for that one.
[252:32.96]I like the instructions too.
[252:33.78]That was very clear.
[252:47.72]No numbers!
[252:51.28]I'll just take a guess.
[253:02.15]I don't think you need numbers.
[253:06.22]It seems pretty unnecessary.
[253:07.66]I got it.
[253:08.52]Kind of.
[253:30.18]Alright, I got it.
[253:32.52]Now what does this say?
[253:35.82]Oh, this says- I know what this says.
[253:58.87]This is- Oh yes.
[254:00.99]What?
[254:01.31]Oh yes!
[254:01.79]No, that's- Oh yes.
[254:03.57]Oh yes.
[254:29.85]Yes.
[254:38.67]There.
[254:40.03]Oh yes.
[254:44.03]That's too easy.
[254:49.18]Hey, guess what?
[254:53.10]Whoa!
[255:00.56]I'm not going to show it yet because I don't want to see it either.
[255:03.46]This is the portion of the stream where I'm going to do Where's Waldo's.
[255:15.61]Is this a spoiler?
[255:17.53]For what?
[255:18.55]What is this movie?
[255:19.57]Oh, this is...
[255:22.32]Alright, if you've never seen Infinity War, let me tell you.
[255:25.76]If you've never seen the movie Infinity War, or its sequel, I believe this is a scene where there is a thing happening.
[255:34.73]If you've never seen both, if you've never seen all the Infinity War and Marvel War, and War, and Game, don't look.
[255:46.21]And don't look at all, okay?
[255:49.92]Although, this is very basic.
[255:51.14]It's just like... This is people just standing around.
[255:54.88]There's just... There... Okay, let me tell you.
[255:57.08]Alright, let me tell you.
[255:58.50]There are people standing around in the movie Endgame at some point, okay?
[256:02.43]Just, if you've never seen the movie, don't fucking look at the screen.
[256:05.39]It's that simple.
[256:06.93]Here's how this is gonna work.
[256:08.89]I am allowed to use the Windows magnifying glass.
[256:16.32]I will give you an example of what that means.
[256:19.69]For instance, if I need to, I get to use it.
[256:23.80]I get to sit back.
[256:25.12]That's cheating.
[256:25.66]No, it's not.
[256:27.02]I get to use the Windows magnifying glass at 125%.
[256:29.12]I've got to explain the rules.
[256:30.94]Give me a chance to explain the rules.
[256:32.78]For instance, so let's say that I want, you know, I've got my little magnifying glass here.
[256:42.16]I've got to find me, and I'm going to have to sit back.
[256:47.60]You guys can know I'll be sitting back here.
[256:54.22]I get to use this.
[257:02.28]Only at 125%.
[257:06.21]Where's Baldo?
[257:07.47]That's OP.
[257:09.01]It's not OP.
[257:09.75]Don't worry, you'll be fine.
[257:11.79]So, here we go.
[257:12.81]Remember, if you've never seen... I almost just turned off the computer because I did the wrong command.
[257:19.85]I saw the Windows thing pop up and I almost turned the fucking computer off.
[257:23.08]Okay.
[257:24.16]Here we go.
[257:25.16]First, where's Waldo?
[257:26.10]I gotta find me in these, the sequence of images here.
[257:30.42]If you've never seen Infinity War or Endgame, fucking... Go make lunch and then come back and, like, figure it out.
[257:36.93]Here we go.
[257:37.33]One.
[257:38.09]Two.
[257:38.27]If you've never seen Endgame before, talk.
[257:40.89]Alright!
[257:45.55]Okay.
[257:58.27]I have no fucking idea.
[258:01.23]Wait, hold on.
[258:01.75]Where's my magnifying glass?
[258:33.96]Wait a minute, you're gonna do something cheeky here?

[260:06.02]I need, like, children's music.
[260:10.09]No, this is fucking makeup tutorial music.
[260:12.03]I don't want the makeup tutorial music.
[260:15.14]Or, like, close-up of my hands DIY hack video.
[260:18.12]I don't, no, no, no.
[260:18.64]I want children's royalty-free music.
[260:39.86]Here, this one will work.
[260:40.60]Alright, let's do the next one.
[260:49.74]This could be in Undertale.
[260:52.13]I'm kidding, this is Undertale's OST track 12.
[261:31.28]He loves the Celtics.
[261:40.73]Is that it?
[262:04.54]Frank Pizza?
[262:05.20]Who else is here?

[304:09.08]What the fuck?
[304:10.50]Why?
[304:13.76]Orson Welles, right here.
[304:17.79]Widowmaker, aiming at the Monop- This is- This is awesome.
[304:24.93]This is insanely elaborate.
[304:27.23]Like, every character is connected to every other character next to them.
[304:31.14]It's like a Rube Goldberg machine of references to the channel.
[304:34.44]This is awesome.
[304:37.55]Easy Pete.
[304:42.09]Oh no, Among the Ash.
[304:42.95]I don't know what that is.
[304:47.31]Oh no, Water Man.
[304:49.89]Overboard.
[304:56.50]This is awesome.
[304:58.04]Why does Pac-Man have a big lump on his head?
[305:00.52]Did he get hit in the head?
[305:03.46]Here are the 3D Movie Maker characters.
[305:07.56]Is this brain fluid?
[305:13.66]I think that's Midas.
[305:15.04]It's Etalyx.
[305:16.19]And a star, I think?
[305:23.11]Hey, it found me again.
[305:23.91]There it is.
[305:27.39]Sea man.

[305:37.76]Oh, go fish.
[305:39.75]I get it.
[305:43.01]This is awesome.
[305:49.25]Let's keep going.
[305:52.29]I think we caught everything.
[305:53.30]I got a good look at this flanker.
[305:56.62]There's the witch, which was supposed to be an emote, but I never did it.
[306:11.32]I have no words for this.
[306:13.12]This is awesome.
[306:15.18]Jewel Wizardry.
[306:17.62]Shito.
[306:20.32]Let's keep going.
[306:23.22]The top 10 emotes that never left beta testing.
[306:29.91]Alright.
[306:33.07]I am apparently in this picture somewhere.
[306:44.45]You're gonna stuff me down here with the birds?
[306:52.53]Have I ever worn... like a white sweater or something?
[306:57.92]I would pick an image from that and just dump me in here.
[307:03.02]Or put me like in the claws or something like that.
[307:17.82]I'm like trying to grab one.
[307:19.50]I'm trying to like grab a seagull.
[307:29.24]Found him.
[307:31.60]You're drowning.
[307:39.51]Trying to save them.
[307:44.41]What is going on here?
[307:46.65]These are a bunch of seagulls and what's, what is this?
[307:51.62]Why is there like a giant fight?
[308:00.50]Why are they like, they're fighting each other?
[308:01.80]They're like, why, what's, I don't understand this.
[308:04.27]Is this constant bird conflict?
[308:09.07]Something like that.
[308:12.40]But, alright, let's keep going.
[308:14.04]There, I found it.
[308:15.78]Good shit.
[308:16.92]Alright, we have made it to spot the difference.
[308:20.62]I've got my trusty pen here.
[308:22.72]I do want to get some music on for this, because we are at the point of the stream where there's only about five, ten things left to do.
[308:32.81]Let's get some relaxing music on.
[308:45.00]Yes.
[308:46.06]This guy's balding.
[308:51.58]I'm talking, like, what is an incredibly relaxing tune that you could just sink back into your chair and just go, ah.
[309:04.13]Stardew Valley?
[309:05.09]Oh, yeah.
[309:06.59]You got it.
[309:07.39]Absolutely.
[309:10.06]That's a good one.
[309:15.28]Alright, can you spot all eight differences?
[309:17.86]98.5% can't get more than six.
[309:20.86]There's eight.
[309:22.44]Let's get my pen ready.
[309:24.50]This is BF Bugleberry's Christmas-themed Halloween printer.
[309:31.43]I completely forgot about the printer.
[309:33.83]Printing out messages.
[309:38.15]That thing didn't work.
[309:41.86]That thing was supposed to print out messages.
[309:45.23]Bit messages whenever they came through.
[309:47.83]And it worked probably seven or eight times.
[309:52.20]Speaking of the printer.
[309:54.54]Bingo.
[309:56.14]No logo.
[309:57.82]Alright, what about... Let's take a look at Bugleberry.
[310:00.40]What am I eating?
[310:05.66]Shito.
[310:07.80]Is not in this spot.
[310:11.91]Beanbag Sonic is not in this box.
[310:14.29]That's what, that's three.
[310:16.67]No pumpkin.
[310:21.42]Alright, so that's four.
[310:25.52]Me?
[310:28.10]Let me look back and forth here.
[310:29.56]Something on the tree?
[310:35.02]Oh.
[310:36.18]Got it.
[310:39.40]There's no hat belt.
[310:44.93]Oh, this doesn't- the tree doesn't have a shadow.
[310:48.39]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[310:50.01]There's two more.
[310:53.36]Look at the presents again.
[310:54.24]What about the printer?
[310:57.14]Nothing with the paper.
[311:04.08]One of the stripes is gonna be gone or something.
[311:13.05]Oh shit!
[311:15.61]There's one more.
[311:18.83]You gave him hair.
[311:26.98]It's gotta be something with the jacket or the pants.
[311:33.78]No, I got it.
[311:35.60]It's Santa's nose.
[311:43.56]No, let me know.
[311:46.10]Look.
[311:47.44]Santa's nose.
[311:47.80]See?
[311:55.76]That's right.
[311:56.16]Look.
[311:56.68]Red.
[311:57.34]No red.
[312:08.97]What?
[312:09.45]I was right about the glove?
[312:11.63]I was?
[312:12.76]I was?
[312:15.22]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?
[312:16.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?
[312:20.59]I got it.
[312:30.61]Hey, there it is!
[312:36.31]I didn't really... I thought it was the one.
[312:38.10]That's a good throw offer.
[312:43.24]Got him all.
[312:45.63]Let's see the next one.
[312:48.59]Fortnite.
[312:49.21]Victory.
[312:50.13]Royale.
[312:54.14]Find all 11 differences for an epic number one victory.
[312:57.06]BL.
[313:01.96]Oh my god.
[313:03.20]Okay.
[313:04.20]Let's start up here.
[313:05.57]The balloon is in the sky here and not here.
[313:08.37]There are 11 differences.
[313:13.73]Yeah, up there.
[313:14.53]What about beanbag Sonic?
[313:15.75]Anything in the tree?
[313:20.39]Hold on.
[313:22.97]What about the parachute?
[313:29.67]Hmm.
[313:33.07]Right here?
[313:34.84]Standing there?
[313:35.98]Not standing there?
[313:39.34]Fireman in the distance?
[313:42.30]Not in the mountains over here.
[313:43.60]Something written.
[313:51.73]What does that say?
[313:52.55]Something written here.
[313:53.23]What does that say?
[314:02.57]Love.
[314:03.07]Late streamer.
[314:03.91]Right.
[314:04.11]Okay.
[314:09.68]Okay.
[314:12.66]uh Garfield's censored you know I got a patch right there I forgot there was a pickaxe in this game how about the generator
[314:38.87]It's gonna be one of these, like, stains here.
[314:41.53]Flowers?
[314:42.73]Tail.
[314:43.15]No tail on the rat.
[314:46.33]How- what do we got?
[314:47.15]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[314:59.00]Wait a minute.
[315:03.26]Something looks off here.
[315:04.40]Why?
[315:11.59]Why does this look off?
[315:13.29]I can't tell.
[315:15.63]That.
[315:15.85]Alright, uh, Dick Dash Lead Rush's patch is different.
[315:25.34]I only got a couple more.
[315:28.76]Wrong.
[315:29.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[315:32.30]There's one more thing.
[315:37.26]What's the last thing?
[315:38.95]It's got to be something down here.
[315:39.99]Something on the shins?
[315:51.52]No, that's correct.
[315:57.46]No, that's correct too.
[315:59.10]These are both right.
[316:06.81]Explosion in the back.
[316:08.67]Something... There's 215 blades of grass on the top one and 214 blades of grass on the bottom one.
[316:20.92]Now that would just be bad game design.
[316:28.61]I think it's something to do with the explosion.
[316:36.02]Garfield?
[316:36.72]I mean, why put Gar- Got it.
[316:39.06]I knew it.
[316:40.31]You don't put a Garfield, like, dick thing here without something underneath it.
[316:44.51]Done.
[316:53.45]That was tricky.
[316:54.05]It was good, though.
[316:55.88]I like the Fortnite.
[316:57.32]I've never- I don't like Fortnite, but I like the Fortnite.
[316:59.74]Setting.
[317:02.62]Setting.
[317:08.96]The local movie theater purchased two different films by mistake.
[317:12.32]The projectionist can't tell which one is the real one.
[317:14.58]Can you find 20 differences between the posters?
[317:17.50]20 differences!
[317:19.11]So that they know which film is the genuine one.
[317:27.43]Tip one for text.
[317:28.29]Each part that's been replaced counts as one change.
[317:32.25]Okay.
[317:33.35]There are many subtle changes, but small differences in position don't count.
[317:39.57]Right.
[317:40.09]So, oh, this is a quarter of an inch taller than this one.
[317:43.17]No.
[317:44.61]Alright, we'll look for 20.
[317:49.49]We got... I'm going to do a different color here.
[317:54.71]Let's just do, like, red.
[317:58.61]And I'm also going to make it smaller.
[317:59.85]Alright, for instance, we got already right here.
[318:05.32]This is a different color.
[318:08.70]No, I'm gonna go back to yellow.
[318:09.80]It's easier to see.
[318:14.81]That?
[318:16.39]Alright, let's start at the top, though.
[318:18.83]No?
[318:19.03]Okay, you got the Jerm of sun back here.
[318:23.86]No sun.
[318:27.68]starring Jerma985 Jeremy elbertson and Jerry harrington okay during Jerma985 right Jeremy elbertson no jex sorry and second Jerma yeah yeah I can't see the yellow there you go yellow couldn't be a worse color well what do you want me to do orange
[319:01.01]I've made the line thicker.
[319:05.63]What about green?
[319:07.53]That's a good idea.
[319:08.37]That shows up pretty well.
[319:17.54]Okay.
[319:23.06]Alright.
[319:24.84]I'm looking at the wand.
[319:26.30]Alright, you got nothing.
[319:27.72]There's no...
[319:30.27]I'm not wearing the cape in this one.
[319:33.03]The movie versus da movie.
[319:37.00]Mouth open with the tongue hanging out.
[319:39.28]Not in this one.
[319:42.28]Anything else on that helmet?
[319:46.92]Height is just a number and so is 985.
[319:49.16]He's not smart.
[319:50.16]He's not brave.
[319:51.67]He's infectious.
[319:53.49]Alright, well this whole thing... Wait, did it say...
[319:57.89]Each part that's been replaced counts as one change.
[320:01.43]So this would be what?
[320:04.16]Two?
[320:05.46]Three?
[320:05.70]Okay, I'll count this one as two.
[320:18.37]That's like kind of two, right?
[320:25.92]Okay, what about the face over here?
[320:30.17]My mouth on this one.
[320:32.61]I'm closed-lipped in this one.
[320:39.95]Not wearing the police badge.
[320:44.33]Well, the sunglasses.
[320:45.11]They look normal.
[320:49.99]I'll put the hands down here.
[320:52.65]Mmm...
[320:56.60]Does this hat count here?
[320:57.82]Does that count?
[321:07.35]Kind of.
[321:07.69]I mean, that's pretty subtle, but I'm gonna say yeah.
[321:19.96]Down here, mouth.
[321:22.95]Is that my mouth being opened a little more?
[321:30.69]NC 17 versus are Coming soon no dot dot dots It's his whole face I Guess it is kind it is right No, no, no, no, I don't think that's correct

[323:37.08]This box.
[323:37.52]What about the lightsaber?
[323:45.82]What am I missing?
[323:47.16]I think it is the chin.
[324:05.42]This is different.
[324:08.20]Alright, what about back up here?
[324:09.20]Anything of the... What am I at?

[324:19.17]These mouths are different.
[324:21.19]Yes, they are.
[324:25.09]No, look, that's different.
[324:26.25]Look, look, look, look.
[324:28.17]I'll get the magnifying glass.
[324:29.11]I'll prove it.
[324:29.45]Look.
[324:30.04]Check it out.
[324:35.38]Take a look at that.
[324:38.02]Look.
[324:38.88]See?
[324:41.12]The brightness has been turned up on it.
[324:43.24]Remember, this thing has subtle differences.
[324:46.10]That's a very subtle difference, but it's there.
[324:47.52]Do I got them all?
[324:59.77]The middle face, too, is wrong.
[325:03.47]Yeah, I guess, like, the eyes, too, like, up here.
[325:05.69]Alright, how many do I have?
[325:09.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
[325:11.81]25.
[325:11.93]Alright.
[325:12.21]I think I got them all.
[325:32.40]Middle face is 1?
[325:34.14]Alright, well then... 24.
[325:36.47]The J is wrong.
[325:41.89]25.
[325:44.09]What's with the lightsaber?
[325:58.40]How is it different?
[326:01.69]He's got over-completion.
[326:03.13]Is this the shirt?
[326:09.67]I don't see it.
[326:19.13]The brightness on the shirt?
[326:20.13]Got it!
[326:22.25]26.
[326:22.31]That was good shit.
[326:34.05]Let's keep going.
[326:37.61]I'll go... Can you spot the eight differences between these two pictures?
[326:53.82]I love this.
[326:56.28]This is awesome.
[326:57.52]Give me the original source of that.
[327:00.00]I want the source.
[327:02.40]It's Sans Auto!
[327:04.74]Okay, well obviously there's a giant fucking spider on my head here, and then... I have no idea what this is.
[327:10.84]Is that a... Is it an Unreal Tournament weapon?
[327:13.30]There's eight differences?
[327:28.19]I only see one.
[327:36.67]There are no other differences in this whole picture.
[328:09.26]No, are you serious?
[328:24.47]Oh, that's the body of the spider.
[328:30.31]I thought it was like a fucking Gears of War weapon or something.
[328:34.33]Right.
[328:34.93]Okay.
[328:37.45]I didn't know that was the body.
[328:38.97]I don't know how.
[328:40.21]Whatever.
[328:40.59]That was a good one.
[328:48.81]Let's keep going.
[328:51.55]Dermot flew to Vegas and is now suffering from traumatic hallucinations due to eating his friends on the balloon.
[328:55.61]That's not confirmed.
[328:56.69]It didn't happen.
[328:57.86]Help him determine what is real by spotting the 10 differences.
[329:00.78]This is fucking stupid.
[329:07.70]This is stupid.
[329:10.28]Fucking Garfield T-pose is the first thing I have to see.
[329:30.33]Uh, I don't... What do I even have to say about this?
[329:34.35]Do I have any words at all?
[329:38.37]Not really.
[329:40.30]How many are there?
[329:40.98]I think I got them all.
[329:52.21]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[329:55.91]What about the rat?
[329:56.53]Something's going on with the rat.
[330:03.58]What is that thing?
[330:05.50]That's like Vinny, right?
[330:06.52]That's like the Vinny meat thing?
[330:16.24]That's Vinny's meat.
[330:20.96]Right.
[330:22.62]Alright, what else?
[330:34.14]What's going on with Elvis?
[330:34.88]Anything?
[330:39.92]No?
[330:40.18]I don't see any difference with Elvis.
[330:45.34]That's so stupid.
[330:47.07]The one bush in all of this whole valley here.
[330:58.83]This gnome, yeah, is just fucking with my head.
[331:07.87]I think I got them all.
[331:13.56]Anybody see anything else?
[331:18.88]But which one is real?
[331:23.61]This one.
[331:24.43]This one has the sun.
[331:27.55]This is Jupiter.
[331:28.27]Jupiter's not in our sky.
[331:29.29]The sun is.
[331:29.85]This one's the real one.
[331:32.01]Check, please.
[331:41.68]And Pac-Man's yellow.
[331:42.54]I mean, guys, really.
[331:44.48]I feel like there's something with the rat, but I don't see anything.
[331:49.95]I'm just going to circle it just in case.
[331:55.63]Got it.
[331:55.91]I've been doing that fucking walk since I was like 17.
[332:06.61]Alright, I think, is there any more?
[332:10.73]Is there one more?
[332:12.97]There are.
[332:15.75]Spot the eight differences between the alternate realities.
[332:21.07]Well, I'll tell you, you missed a very, very, very good opportunity here.
[332:24.88]For this to be like this, and then for me to be hurt on the ground with a sword in me from Pinwheel.
[332:30.88]Because I can tell you that that would be not correct.
[332:32.38]That would be not a real reality.
[332:33.70]Well, first of all, Shido is pink.
[332:37.75]This is a McChicken and, I mean, why would I ever order this when I could order that?
[332:42.93]Except, what the hell have you put on here?
[332:45.79]Why would you ever put that shredded, disgusting fucking lettuce?
[332:49.44]No.
[332:52.56]What about the sky?
[332:54.12]I got the hat.
[332:55.18]Yeah, right here.
[332:55.82]What about the sides?
[333:03.93]You guys love Garfield.
[333:06.88]I think you just pretend to not like Garfield.
[333:09.02]I think you guys really love Garfield.
[333:13.10]I'm convinced.
[333:13.72]Let's log down here.
[333:18.48]Alright, what are we at?
[333:21.61]What about the wave?
[333:22.51]The patch?
[333:23.35]The burger?
[333:25.11]Something with Pinwheel.
[333:27.33]Yeah, right here.
[333:28.13]Different emote.
[333:31.81]Shoes.
[333:32.57]Head.
[333:32.77]Head.
[333:35.10]Pinwheel.
[333:35.66]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[333:37.53]You got it.
[333:37.95]Missing a lantern up here.
[333:39.37]I think I got it.
[333:42.34]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
[334:04.93]Got it.
[334:07.66]Have we reached the end?
[334:37.52]Hello, Jerba.
[334:38.79]If you're reading this transmission, we need your help.
[334:41.65]Demon Grandpa traveled back in time in an attempt to reverse his ultimate untimely death.
[334:47.81]In doing so, he created a paradox.
[334:49.89]The timeline is destabilizing, causing anomalies to appear.
[334:53.52]Spot all 13 differences to restore the timeline and save the world.
[335:08.75]Well, right off the bat, he said he's not wearing a fireman shirt.
[335:21.29]Beatbag Sonic was not here.
[335:22.77]Otto was not here.
[335:34.89]God damn it.
[335:39.40]But look!
[335:41.04]I've talked about this a million... I'm gonna... No, we'll go over this after.
[335:43.82]Okay, there's that.
[335:47.52]That's me.
[335:54.25]Ear pods.
[336:00.19]That was a real... That's subtle.
[336:01.73]There's an ear pod.
[336:07.05]Oh, somebody's just missing.
[336:09.69]Okay.
[336:16.92]He hit the top hat.
[336:21.48]Okay.
[336:21.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[336:22.76]Different color.
[336:47.15]Oh, wait.
[336:51.40]Different design.
[336:53.56]I thought you were going to do, like, instead of, you're going to put the thumb out or something.
[337:03.32]Right here?
[337:04.49]It's on the other side?
[337:08.27]I'm getting close.
[337:08.99]Hold on.
[337:09.33]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[337:09.83]There's one more.
[337:18.60]What is it?
[337:20.06]What the fuck is it?
[337:43.22]Over here, I... No, Shido's blocking it.
[337:46.13]The pin.
[337:48.25]The dots there.
[337:49.35]It's a rat.
[337:53.66]Done.
[337:54.36]Bingo.
[337:55.04]Completed.
[337:55.54]13. 13.
[338:08.09]Very, very cool.
[338:08.91]Alright, now it's time for me to shut the music off.
[338:12.72]Cut the music.
[338:15.96]We're going in fucking tight on this one.
[338:21.98]I want to show you something here.
[338:23.43]This is fucking important.
[338:25.29]Let's get it.
[338:25.75]Let's get a line here.
[338:28.21]I want you to look at this area here.
[338:31.47]Right here.
[338:31.95]We're going to go in even closer.
[338:32.79]Okay.
[338:42.20]I would like you to see, take a look at everybody's arms.
[338:45.68]Alright.
[338:45.96]This is important because why on Earth?
[338:51.24]Let's go over this quickly.
[338:54.06]So I'm bending my knees right now.
[338:56.76]They're bent.
[338:59.93]I'm leaning forward, bending my knees and slumping down right now.
[339:08.39]The... I... If I were to extend my knees... And look at... Look at... I'm out in front.
[339:14.88]I'm not side to side here.
[339:17.90]Look at this.
[339:18.60]Shoulder.
[339:19.12]Shoulder.
[339:20.28]Shoulder.
[339:20.80]Shoulder.
[339:21.62]Shoulder.
[339:22.06]Shoulder.
[339:23.02]Right?
[339:24.31]No.
[339:24.77]No.
[339:25.41]I'm in.
[339:26.37]I'm out in front.
[339:28.57]Down.
[339:31.35]See?
[339:32.55]I'm leaning forward and down.
[339:35.41]If I extend these legs...
[339:37.77]I come up from here to here.
[339:40.93]Right here is the line where I would be if I were standing up straight.
[339:47.51]I don't know how many times I have to go over this.
[339:58.18]I'll go over this a thousand times.
[340:05.02]Take a look at this too.
[340:09.01]I want you to see this.
[340:13.66]Are you fucking kidding me?
[340:15.58]Like, are you serious?
[340:24.44]That is an arm wrestle you lose arm.
[340:30.41]Look at this, alright?
[340:31.01]Look at this down here.
[340:39.52]And yes, that's another thing that I've had to explain before.
[340:43.84]Do you think that my... Look, hold on.
[340:48.53]This is the ground.
[340:50.13]You want to talk about like, oh, I've measured how far the ground was.
[340:54.31]The ground is right here.
[340:57.69]Do you really fucking seriously think, in a million years, that when I rest my arms on my sides, my hands are like a foot and a half from the ground?
[341:08.95]That would mean I would have to have like four and a half foot long arms.
[341:22.42]And that's just evidence here.
[341:24.54]I'll draw a little thing for you just to get this out of the way.
[341:27.22]Here we go.
[341:28.80]Here's like a ruler right here.
[341:31.30]Right?
[341:32.70]Here's the ruler.
[341:35.67]This is like... This is like five feet right here.
[341:39.19]This is five feet.
[341:40.71]Five.
[341:41.71]This is like six feet right here.
[341:46.00]Right there.
[341:46.78]Right there!
[341:47.80]Right there!
[341:49.20]Right there!
[341:59.77]It's actually kind of funny, because this is actually how fucking tall I probably am.
[342:08.48]here you're showing like how tall I actually am that's a clean five seven and a half to five eight depending on shoes it's like right here maybe it may be like a hair taller
[342:38.59]Nerd neck.
[342:39.65]Let's take a look at that neck.
[342:40.83]What do you think?
[342:43.68]Alright, neck no fucking around.
[342:45.78]Let's go back to the original.
[342:50.80]That's a nice fucking neck.
[342:59.04]I look like a Pizza Hut worker.
[343:02.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[343:13.44]what does a Pizza Hut worker mean I guess you know what I'm I'm gonna you want I'm gonna show you guys something I'm gonna show you guys something I'm gonna get you know what you know what I'm gonna do I am going to hit up some of these wonderful people here
[343:40.74]And I'm going to ask for other, I'm going to ask for pictures from this event where I'm standing next to some of these people who I'm standing next to some of these people and we'll get the proof, the real proof.
[343:56.17]I will recreate this whole photo.
[344:08.65]I've seen that clip from Slynn.
[344:10.35]He's taking the piss.
[344:12.08]He's playing the game.
[344:13.44]He's in on the joke.
[344:24.70]I'm fucking this goddamn tall.
[344:26.22]Right here.
[344:27.30]Right there.
[344:27.74]You know what?
[344:29.06]Fuck it.
[344:29.32]I'm like up here.
[344:30.66]Extend my neck this way.
[344:31.92]I'm like this fucking tall.
[344:46.15]What's the next one?
[344:54.51]Sometimes you gotta just prove something.
[345:02.40]It's just so fucking obvious.
[345:05.15]I remember looking at this picture and I fucking remember going, holy shit, that doesn't look good.
[345:12.41]That looks real fucking bad.
[345:14.91]And then it was like, I was like, ah, you know, whatever.
[345:17.44]I don't think anyone's going to notice or care.
[345:20.12]And it turned into like a three year long issue.
[345:27.59]Four years later.
[345:33.10]Little did I think that this fucking photo.
[345:39.33]Measure yourself with a tape measure on stream.
[345:40.87]I will.
[345:42.13]No.
[345:42.77]No.
[345:46.09]How about this?
[345:48.55]Just see me at TwitchCon.
[345:50.80]And we'll fucking stand next to each other.
[345:59.54]Alright, how about this?
[346:01.08]If you come up to me at TwitchCon and you think I'm under 5'5", and I'm right, let's say I'm over 5'6", 5'7", you owe me $5,000.
[346:10.77]Will you take that bet?
[346:13.47]Are you going to take that bet?
[346:25.90]I'm going to make a lot of money at TwitchCon.
[346:38.42]Alright, let's go.
[346:50.02]Help!
[346:51.60]Oh, this is Shito.
[346:52.90]Help!
[346:53.78]One of Jeremy's clones accidentally stabbed himself so hard that he somehow managed to create an alternate dimension where there are only ten subtle differences.
[347:00.82]Pretty boring, actually.
[347:02.42]Seriously?
[347:03.28]You can't even make an interesting dimension.
[347:05.47]Dumb clone.
[347:11.31]This is awesome.
[347:12.35]This is, like, fucking fantastic.
[347:14.55]Alright, let's go.
[347:16.70]I'm going to go with, first of all, I have a Sans eye.
[347:20.86]Right off the bat.
[347:21.56]Fireman's in my mouth.
[347:27.89]Fucking wicked bald.
[347:34.39]Glue Man is facing the other direction.
[347:36.68]Ooh, wait.
[347:41.16]Glue Man's also facing the other direction, I think, over here.
[347:43.72]This is different.
[347:52.50]One of my sound cubes.
[347:56.28]Alright, what else?
[347:57.91]What about the eye, the hair?
[348:00.25]The chin is extended on this one.
[348:05.71]Sooner or later people are going to think that that's like how long my real chin is.
[348:09.35]And then it's like, oh wow, Jerma's not only 5'2", he also has like a big goblin chin.
[348:16.01]That one's actually true though, unfortunately for me.
[348:20.35]Yeah, that is actually true.
[348:21.77]So, I mean, what am I going to do about that?
[348:24.89]You measure my chin at TwitchCon.
[348:26.21]We'll see if it's fucking six and a half inches long.
[348:32.25]Alright, what else we got here?
[348:33.24]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[348:34.98]There's still three more things.
[348:43.84]What about anything else on the earbud?
[348:56.27]Looking for the eyebrows.
[349:00.13]The nose.
[349:00.65]Right here.
[349:06.91]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[349:14.53]One more thing.
[349:19.29]Something with the arm.
[349:22.45]The finger.
[349:24.39]Hair.
[349:54.06]Nose?
[349:54.58]No.
[349:57.34]Oh.
[349:58.04]Yeah, you're right.
[349:59.56]I would not have gotten that if I didn't cheat.
[350:04.86]That's very subtle.
[350:08.46]Sweaty armpits.
[350:10.16]You can't see that from here.
[350:13.10]We need to actually just take a second and just Marvel at how great this is.
[350:24.44]This is fucking fantastic.
[350:26.37]This looks like it's still from a video.
[350:35.09]Awesome.
[350:37.52]I mean, but it is Yanwen, so.
[350:39.68]I mean, they just make consistently fucking incredible work.
[350:44.88]Good shit.
[350:52.30]Are we done?
[350:53.81]No, there's more.
[350:54.85]There is like a couple more, I think.
[350:57.05]I thought that was it.
[350:58.57]Bonus feature.
[351:00.63]Spot the difference.
[351:01.69]Help the rats follow the real Jerma.
[351:03.83]Okay.
[351:05.93]Okay.
[351:08.04]This is great too.
[351:09.90]They're all good.
[351:11.48]They're all great.
[351:13.34]Open mouth here.
[351:16.22]Closed.
[351:18.34]J. The music is different.
[351:23.04]Missing this.
[351:27.06]And missing a note.
[351:32.30]What about up here?
[351:33.54]Different shirt.
[351:36.71]Fireman versus the night sky.
[351:39.93]Hair, eyes, mouth.
[351:50.77]Rats, let's see.
[351:52.39]Tail, tail, tail is different.
[351:57.95]Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers.
[351:59.59]Eyes are different.
[352:04.32]No tail versus tail.
[352:08.68]What about legs?
[352:10.36]They all have four legs.
[352:12.93]Oh, no, you don't.
[352:14.63]You have an extra leg.
[352:17.07]I hope.
[352:23.68]You have a third whisker.
[352:27.38]What about the noses?
[352:29.28]Nose, nose, nose, nose, nose, nose.
[352:31.84]What about the eyes?
[352:32.88]Ball, you all have two eyes.
[352:45.00]The Jerm is the note.
[352:46.16]That's the only difference.
[352:49.64]Okay.
[352:54.23]Yeah, that makes sense.
[352:56.19]There's a height difference.
[353:00.29]Don't get me going again.
[353:06.15]Alright.
[353:09.47]Anything else?
[353:15.77]Yeah, I know, there is.
[353:16.97]I'm seeing it.
[353:17.57]I see it.
[353:25.51]Go get the ruler.
[353:26.59]I'm gonna fucking get a ruler.
[353:33.86]The bottom one is bending down.
[353:38.26]Hey, watch it.
[353:42.91]Shito, Shito.
[353:44.71]I think that's it.
[353:49.79]Do you guys see anything else?
[353:50.59]I think I got it all.
[353:53.06]Very cute.
[354:02.42]Good to go.
[354:08.21]Awesome, awesome job.
[354:11.11]Very cute, very cool.
[354:14.27]What's next?
[354:15.86]Hey!
[354:16.68]Remember this one?
[354:19.07]I do!
[354:19.41]Let's do it again!
[354:20.37]10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27!
[354:24.49]Yeah!
[354:24.65]Just loop it.
[354:46.45]There were all the activities.
[354:53.87]That took six hours to do that.
[354:56.47]I thought it was going to be shorter.
[354:59.29]I thought this was only going to be like a couple hours, but there was a lot.
[355:02.28]There was a ton of contributions.
[355:05.70]So there still is a bunch of jokes and a bunch of brain teasers.
[355:13.18]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to compile these jokes and brain teasers.
[355:21.73]I'm going to pull out some of my favorites.
[355:23.25]We're going to go over them.
[355:27.55]Not today.
[355:31.49]Because I did not realize that I'd been streaming for six hours.
[355:36.86]I was kind of having too much fun.
[355:42.98]I was really only supposed to stream for three or four.
[355:52.86]But I was having too much fun with all this stuff.
[355:58.36]I did most of the stories.
[355:59.36]The stories were ridiculous too.
[356:02.41]Jokes and brain teasers, I can compile and do them.
[356:05.87]And I might just do that.
[356:08.59]I might just pull them out randomly.
[356:10.73]Like whenever I feel like just doing something, just hanging out.
[356:13.81]There's a shitload of them.
[356:18.41]Yeah, I am going to bid you all farewell.
[356:21.75]This is the last time you are all going to see or hear my voice and face until the 21st.
[356:33.10]Got a lot to do.
[356:37.27]The next time this stream is live, you will be at the carnival.
[356:44.76]He tricked us into giving him free jokes for the rest of the year, and that's the play.
[356:50.90]You figured it out.
[356:55.39]The carnival, I have a... I pinned a tweet, and I have a thing that you can do, not a hashtag, an exclamation point carnival.
[357:05.74]I'll tell you the date.
[357:06.98]September 21st, starting at around 12 p.m.
[357:09.50]Eastern.
[357:10.44]That's right, I'm going back to Eastern time for this.
[357:23.60]But there's a lot to do in the meantime.
[357:26.99]The few companies that are involved.
[357:30.65]We have to pin down a lot of things.
[357:33.63]When are we going to get access to the robots?
[357:36.60]When and where we will be streaming this from.
[357:43.18]There's an event coordinator and there is the robot company.
[357:48.37]So there is a lot to do.
[357:58.19]I will see you guys... Saturday.
[358:02.53]Those of you still sticking around... We will be doing the end of the... Stream... Stuff.
[358:09.87]I'm gonna go like this.
[358:10.93]And I'm gonna go like this.
[358:11.92]Thank you... For that.
[358:14.44]Tonight.
[358:15.96]I knew I was trying... The reason why I wanted to really do this... This is gonna sound... Um... It's not gonna sound bad or anything.
[358:24.08]But it's gonna sound...
[358:27.88]Uh, it may be weird to some of you.
[358:29.18]This was a test.
[358:31.84]Of Community Night stuff.
[358:34.20]This was a test.
[358:34.86]I tested you.
[358:37.86]I think you... I think it was great.
[358:46.10]I wanted to do something chill, and I wanted to have a bunch of community-contributed stuff.
[358:50.66]Artwork.
[358:53.82]I wanted to see how long it would take to do this kind of stuff.
[359:00.52]I have a pretty good idea of submissions and all the mods that were involved in it, too.
[359:07.89]Thank you, everybody, for making a stream like this happen.
[359:13.81]I knew I wanted something the day before I was pretty much going to leave, to just be relaxing and hang out and just see how a community night went.
[359:23.72]This is a community night.
[359:24.74]This is the first one, essentially, is what you just watched.
[359:36.65]Thank you for being a part of it.
[359:40.99]Let's continue.
[359:42.73]On to the bits.
[359:45.11]Earlier today, we had $5 from Bake Me Home.
[359:51.04]You should have a contest to design a Jerma Odin emote.
[359:56.74]Don't give us any prompts.
[359:57.80]Just let us come up with what we think Jerma Odin should be.
[360:06.53]I probably will do another emote contest eventually.
[360:11.93]I have like a lot of slots now.
[360:14.92]They need to be filled.
[360:17.20]I just need to get on it.
[360:22.12]But that's not a bad idea.
[360:29.34]Thank you Slalom for the five dollars.
[360:34.54]My colonoscopy went well.
[360:36.04]Thanks, Jerm.
[360:36.85]And then they say, come to Brazil.
[360:42.91]I'm really happy to hear that it went well.
[360:44.59]As I told you, it's easy.
[360:50.16]It's a lot more strange and nerve-wracking than the procedure actually is.
[360:58.26]So, I'm glad to hear it went well.
[361:05.07]Thank you so much for the five dolls.
[361:09.30]Jerma wild one, wild two, wild three.
[361:15.58]Uh, yeah, the prep is the worst part of this.
[361:19.98]The thing about a colonoscopy is just not being able to eat.
[361:23.81]Once you cross that threshold of not being able to eat solid food for two or three straight days, is when you start to succumb to madness.
[361:36.69]just drinking clear chicken broth and eating jello is gah it's horrible and the worst part is even when after you're done
[361:54.30]You still, you're all kind of fucked up.
[361:56.43]So you, you're not, the second you get out of a colonoscopy, you're not sitting there going, oh, where?
[362:00.73]Can't wait to go to Burger King.
[362:02.73]No, you're like on like drugs and shit.
[362:05.15]You just want to go home and go to bed.
[362:07.51]And just relax and maybe eat something small.
[362:14.92]But I'm glad to hear it went well.
[362:16.48]Thank you for the $5.
[362:18.96]Thank you to Sam Freelance Police for the $5.
[362:24.05]Jerma, I gave you $5 on the Dragon's Lair stream, but you got coxed, so you never saw it.
[362:28.55]I'm sorry about that.
[362:29.59]I hate when that happens.
[362:32.81]Because it just deletes every sub and every bit that was there.
[362:36.19]And then having to go back and sort of re-read everything is almost like a day or two has gone by, and none of it's relevant anymore for that day and that few hours.
[362:48.22]I just always feel fucking terrible when it happens, so.
[362:51.48]We sometimes try to go back, and I've done it a few times, going back and reading them.
[362:56.36]But I'm sorry that it happened.
[362:57.44]I wish I could correct it.
[362:59.68]I wish that stuff didn't happen, but it does.
[363:07.54]But they say, I've been watching your stuff since I was like 13.
[363:10.74]I'm 19 now.
[363:14.07]I just left my home country of Portugal to move to Germany for Game Design University.
[363:19.53]This is my first night all alone.
[363:21.57]You have any tips on living alone far away from your parents?
[363:25.23]Thanks for all the laughs and for being with me on the journey.
[363:29.77]That sounds like quite a journey.
[363:32.31]Yeah, congratulations.
[363:35.13]Going to a Game Design University, that's awesome.
[363:40.38]The, I don't know how relevant this is to you, but it was very relevant for me, and I don't know what the, obviously it might not be possible with, you know, being at a university or wherever you're living at the university or something, but I lived alone for a very long time.
[363:58.64]And the number one thing that I would say to anybody that lives alone is get a dog.
[364:05.24]Get a dog, get a cat, get an animal, get some kind of companion.
[364:10.28]Because then you're not.
[364:17.25]And if that's not possible...
[364:20.01]You know, obviously if you can't bring into a living situation a friend, like a pet, a companion, right?
[364:29.20]Then the best thing you can do is to try to find stuff to do that you're interested in, that you can find other people that like the same shit that you do.
[364:43.63]I've said this advice before, but everybody's on the same fucking page.
[364:48.15]Nobody knows anybody.
[364:50.11]And all you have are your interests.
[364:52.89]Everything else is left completely at the door.
[364:55.75]Nobody knows anybody.
[364:59.12]Nobody knows how you were in high school.
[365:02.58]Nobody knows who your friends are.
[365:04.50]Nobody knows what your life is like or who you kind of are as a person.
[365:08.83]So you're only basing stuff on interests.
[365:18.53]And if you can find a group of people that are interested in the same thing, you kind of just start at that.
[365:24.05]I like this, you like this too.
[365:26.53]I don't know who you are and you don't know me either.
[365:29.01]But we're literally sitting next to each other in this fucking class.
[365:33.07]And I like that shit too.
[365:36.15]And then you just start talking.
[365:37.34]You just start hanging out.
[365:38.28]You start doing group projects.
[365:39.76]A lot of colleges do that.
[365:40.74]They do group projects and they put you together and...
[365:51.12]That's really the way to do it.
[365:55.20]Or, like I said, get an animal.
[365:57.30]Because if you have an animal, you're never alone.
[365:59.26]Because, whatever, like, for instance, Otto, right?
[366:02.88]I was always alone.
[366:05.54]In that place that I was living in.
[366:07.25]It was just me and Otto.
[366:09.87]And that was it.
[366:11.49]And, you know, sometimes it was a little weird.
[366:12.99]You know, I'd get up and I'd make food.
[366:14.73]And it's just like, okay, like...
[366:18.93]Creeping up the stairs, and... There's no humans.
[366:23.49]But it didn't matter, because within five seconds of me thinking about that... Oh, there's Otto, lying on the pillow.
[366:28.01]Hey, Otto!
[366:28.59]And he's like, hi, I'm here, and I'm happy to see you.
[366:34.25]So you get to essentially have that kind of interaction with something.
[366:39.19]Take him for a walk.
[366:42.42]Play around.
[366:43.38]Lie down on the couch with him, and stuff like that.
[366:45.44]It was always...
[366:47.87]very easy to just chill with your little furry friend but hopefully that helps good luck take care thank you for the five dollars sam free lance police appreciate it 50 thanks for the four dollars and eight cents I bet you there is at least one triangle picture there was I did not use it uh the other one that I was considered there was a there's one or two others that I didn't like maybe three maybe four total
[367:20.69]You know, 2020 hindsight, there was like three or four of the vine meats, and I was going to use one, and then I was like, oh, I just glossed over them.
[367:33.45]And instead I put in the just circle of the Jerm of sun.
[367:37.31]It was just the one that was a circle.
[367:39.35]I don't know why.
[367:39.93]I was like, yeah, I guess I'll just not put that.
[367:41.92]I don't know why I didn't put that in.
[367:44.59]I think it's because I saw two or three of them in a row, and there was like three or four firemans in a row right there, too.
[367:50.01]So I was like, oh, shit.
[367:51.53]I don't want to have... Maybe I should do it.
[367:52.83]Maybe I should change it up.
[367:58.08]Yes, there was a triangle.
[367:59.60]If you want to do it, it's pretty hard.
[368:01.68]It's in that Discord right now.
[368:02.74]You can go look at it right now.
[368:11.23]Nova Ostra, thanks for the three dollars.
[368:14.55]Hey Jerma, you're the best streamer on Twitch.
[368:16.79]Thank you.
[368:18.17]You always make me laugh no matter what you do.
[368:20.06]Love you.
[368:22.42]That's just an insanely nice thing to have anybody ever say.
[368:26.46]Thank you.
[368:29.88]I'm just doing my thing here.
[368:32.04]That's all I'm going to do and that's all I ever will do.
[368:36.73]I'm glad you enjoy the streams.
[368:37.77]Thank you.
[368:40.14]Hey, Plank, thank you.
[368:41.16]Plank V2 for the 20 bucks, 20 dollars from Plank.
[368:45.71]If you went back 10 years and asked yourself where you would be, would you have pictured this?
[368:49.71]Thanks for making my days.
[368:54.55]Uhhh... No.
[368:59.23]There was no way to predict that this was gonna happen.
[369:02.01]Because it didn't exist.
[369:06.10]Something like live streaming, whether it's video games or edited video type content or IRL content or this stuff didn't exist.
[369:19.59]So there was no way to ever know this would ever be a thing that anybody did.
[369:26.17]Even back with YouTube.
[369:29.89]YouTube, yeah, I mean, YouTube was a thing.
[369:32.74]But I never thought at all that YouTube was going to turn into a way for me to make money and be a job, essentially.
[369:39.52]No way.
[369:42.90]There was no monetization on videos when I was making videos.
[369:49.89]That happened a couple years after I started.
[369:52.81]At least a year or two.
[369:55.39]And then once it became knowledgeable that you could get ad revenue from your videos, the whole thing erupted.
[370:04.30]Erupted.
[370:06.02]People started coming in and, holy shit, we can make money from our YouTube videos now.
[370:10.66]And the whole space just went crazy.
[370:23.27]I just kind of kept doing what I was doing.
[370:27.05]And I'll be honest, not very much has changed.
[370:31.74]In regards to how I approach what I do here.
[370:39.18]But no, there's no way I would have known.
[370:44.72]What would I have done if I didn't do it?
[370:48.44]I would have worked with animals or something.
[370:52.16]I've done volunteer work before with animal, um... Uh, why can't I think of the word?
[371:00.29]Animal shelters.
[371:00.97]I've done volunteer work with animal shelters.
[371:04.12]I really, I would maybe try to have been like a vet tech or something.
[371:10.93]I liked computers.
[371:12.19]Maybe I would have done some computer stuff, IT stuff.
[371:14.73]I don't know.
[371:15.25]I've talked about it a few times.
[371:17.13]But, no, no, no.
[371:18.71]I can't tell you.
[371:19.57]Who knows?
[371:19.93]In ten years, I might be doing that.
[371:22.23]I can't predict you what's going to happen in five years, ten years.
[371:24.39]No, I do.
[371:26.83]You could be a mosquito doctor.
[371:30.79]We had big bits just coming right now.
[371:33.83]From the man himself.
[371:37.55]Phylactery Lich.
[371:41.25]$50 From phylactery 5000 bits Thank you again For the ultra money They say hey Jerma, I'm not gonna be able to watch the carnival live I have to work so I can afford to give you more subs Can you go ahead and move it to Sunday?
[372:06.24]That would be great.
[372:07.16]I
[372:12.28]I tell you, man, I better be like 1% of your income.
[372:17.59]I better be like 0.2% of your income.
[372:29.67]He's getting closer to owning 20.
[372:31.71]He's got 20.
[372:32.03]30% of the stream.
[372:32.59]He doesn't own 50% of the company yet.
[372:37.15]Don't do it.
[372:42.02]No, I can't change that.
[372:44.77]That date is not something that I am able to change.
[372:47.97]Remember, it's not just me.
[372:50.23]I have hired two separate companies to make the stream possible.
[372:58.64]All the robot contracting out with Andy Mark to make the robots, and then the company that is producing the actual stream portion
[373:09.73]Event location.
[373:11.87]And.
[373:12.61]Crew.
[373:13.97]Hey.
[373:14.53]Can I do it on Sunday instead?
[373:16.19]It's like.
[373:16.81]What the fuck are you talking about?
[373:19.53]No.
[373:19.75]It's set in stone.
[373:20.61]With these two different companies.
[373:33.18]And as much as it would.
[373:34.10]You know.
[373:35.82]You always want more time.
[373:37.30]But we don't need it.
[373:41.17]I mean, you guys gotta remember, this has been something that's been being worked on for a few months.
[373:46.69]More than that.
[373:50.91]So it's not a thing where it's like, oh, we can move it, I guess.
[374:00.43]I had to liquidate bald coin for this one.
[374:07.33]But there are multiple companies involved.
[374:10.42]I mean, I'm not changing the date, but if it ever came down to it, if it was kind of just me and another person and maybe one other thing and we contracted out robots and... Now, there's like 20 people that are involved in this.
[374:24.84]Split between two, potentially even three different companies.
[374:37.22]So, no, that's completely out of my hands at this point.
[374:43.48]We all agreed on a date that things could happen, when people were available for things, when this company was going to be available to produce it, and where they were going to produce it.
[374:56.15]Those are all things that I cannot change.
[374:57.55]Do we have to fight over the robots?
[375:05.62]In a way, in a matter of speaking, yes.
[375:09.08]In a matter of speaking, yes.
[375:11.84]For control.
[375:13.89]You know what I'm saying?
[375:24.35]I'm prepared.
[375:25.37]I'm prepared.
[375:28.30]But let's go back to what we were doing before.
[375:29.96]Phylactery again.
[375:31.38]You've given fucking hundreds and hundreds of dollars today.
[375:36.12]And yesterday.
[375:36.70]And the day before.
[375:37.66]And the day before.
[375:38.42]And like a week before that.
[375:39.46]And two weeks before that.
[375:40.52]It's a ton of money, dude.
[375:48.40]But thanks.
[375:53.00]Thank you also to Grack Store for the 10 bucks.
[375:56.49]Draw as fast as you can.
[375:58.25]And then they wink.
[375:59.61]What's the wink for?
[376:02.39]Draw as fast as you can.
[376:08.56]Thanks for the $10, CrackStore.
[376:09.80]I appreciate it.
[376:12.24]Jack the Mac, thanks for the $5.
[376:13.36]Jeremiah, I got some bad news.
[376:16.48]I got a tip on Grillmaster Barbecue.
[376:19.53]We all know that you destroyed him, but I've come to learn that he is slowly regenerating in the darkest recesses of Castle Griffinsteed.
[376:26.19]He's weak, but you're the only one who knows how to stop him.
[376:29.73]Please help us all.
[376:33.83]Thanks for the $5.
[376:34.29]Thanks for the $5.
[376:41.52]Thank you Trauma Advocate for the 10 bucks thousand bits.
[376:46.44]Jerma, I don't have time to watch your streams, but I love catching up on your goofs on YouTube.
[376:50.24]Thanks, and hope you keep up the good work.
[376:53.92]You can thank Mac and Effectator for making all of the second Jerma content.
[377:04.81]They do a great job.
[377:06.63]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful stuff.
[377:14.64]Thank you so much for the $10.
[377:16.30]And I'm glad you can at least kind of catch up on YouTube.
[377:22.85]That was the point of that channel.
[377:24.65]It's for people that don't or can't want to sit around and watch an entire 5, 6, 7 plus hour stream.
[377:32.71]There's another avenue for you to experience at least some of the stuff that we did.
[377:37.05]That's why it's there.
[377:43.21]Hey, happy birthday, Theus, for the... Thanks for the ten dollars.
[377:47.25]Happy birthday, Theus.
[377:50.85]I'm on break.
[377:51.39]I just stopped by to throw bread at you.
[377:55.43]Throw bread?
[378:02.68]What's... Oh, money.
[378:04.78]Money, right.
[378:06.42]Well, hey, thanks.
[378:09.50]Hopefully you had a good break.
[378:11.82]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[378:16.88]We also had, uh, Berry Good Cobold, thanks for the three bucks.
[378:22.92]Berry Gold, Berry Gold Gold Bold, Berry, Berry Gold, I can't fucking say this name.
[378:31.41]Marigold Round, Berry Gold, oh my god.
[378:36.55]Berry Good Cobold.
[378:41.50]Okay.
[378:41.62]Okay.
[378:43.12]Sometimes I get locked and my brain just tries to read a word and it gets stuck.
[378:57.51]But thank you to you for the three dolls.
[379:01.66]He did it.
[379:07.48]Yeah, my mind sometimes just runs around in a circle.
[379:11.34]But thank you for the $3.
[379:12.14]They say, Jerma, I'm in a depressive rut and your second Jerma channel is keeping me going these days.
[379:19.05]Those days that I just stay in bed.
[379:20.69]Thank you for being a great streamer and a wonderful being.
[379:24.55]Thanks for the $3.
[379:25.87]And like I just said, I'm happy that the YouTube channel as well is there for people to enjoy.
[379:35.81]I really hope you feel better.
[379:39.23]When you get in a rut, it sucks.
[379:42.95]Hopefully you can figure it out.
[379:44.09]Hopefully you can ride it out.
[379:47.85]And figure out what you need to do.
[379:55.21]Thank you for the three dollars.
[379:56.24]I'm glad you enjoyed that channel.
[380:03.26]Thank you so much for the three bucks.
[380:11.48]And then here was the 69 subs from Phylactery.
[380:19.66]Every time I always have, when I have my stream labs open over here, and I get to a point where somebody like Phylactery gave 30, 40, 50, 60 plus subs, it is just a, it's just a huge scroll.
[380:38.22]It's an overwhelming scroll.
[380:42.36]So, thank you again for that.
[380:44.25]And then you topped it off again with 28.
[380:45.81]Thanks a lot, man.
[380:54.30]The Ultra Scroll, yeah.
[380:56.91]And then Tath... Tathlybash... Tathlybash, thanks for the $10,000 bits.
[381:04.90]My girlfriend and I have been watching you since the TF2 days.
[381:07.96]You may very well be one of the greatest entertainers of our time.
[381:11.62]And catching the stream is always a highlight of our night.
[381:15.29]That is quite a statement.
[381:19.87]That's... Thank you for that.
[381:30.08]I never thought I would ever hear anybody say something like that, so... First of all, thanks.
[381:35.22]I... I really appreciate it.
[381:39.98]And then they say... Uh... Catching the stream is always a highlight of our night.
[381:45.74]I'd love to see you play through the Jak and Dexter trilogy soon, as it would bring together my favorite series with my favorite streamer.
[381:52.51]Stay legendary.
[381:53.83]New England misses you.
[381:55.79]I miss New England, too.
[381:59.90]All the time.
[382:03.64]But I love Las Vegas.
[382:06.88]Leave a Las Vegas.
[382:08.14]As they say.
[382:15.93]But thanks.
[382:17.49]Jack and Dexter.
[382:19.45]Um... I've never played them.
[382:23.17]I know that people love them.
[382:24.93]I don't have one second in any of those games.
[382:30.60]I wonder.
[382:32.66]If that would be fun to stream.
[382:34.34]Might.
[382:35.58]Just start at one.
[382:36.89]Didn't they remake them?
[382:37.79]There's a remaster, right?
[382:38.75]There's the Jak and Daxter remake.
[382:42.53]Should I do the original or should I play the remake?
[382:44.99]The remaster ones.
[382:51.08]Play the remake.
[382:52.02]Okay.
[382:55.30]It's just a remaster, right?
[382:57.72]Alright.
[382:58.36]Yeah, put it on the list.
[382:59.69]Put it in the recommended channel.
[383:01.99]I'll see it, and I'll put it down.
[383:05.39]They're HD ports.
[383:06.21]That's alright, though.
[383:08.99]I'm gonna get the credits on screen.
[383:16.32]We're just about at the end here.
[383:17.76]Fly him up.
[383:25.07]Here they are.
[383:29.50]Again, thanks everybody for the subs.
[383:32.04]This is an insane amount of you now.
[383:39.07]And some of you are responsible for a shitload of these people.
[383:49.11]I hope that I can continue to make you laugh and make you happy.
[383:58.45]Hopefully this coming weekend is one of those occasions Because this channel is seeing a huge amount of people and money and I'm gonna try So thanks again to all of you This stream will be very interesting regardless
[384:32.34]But thank you to Cold Warhol for the thousand bits, 10 bucks.
[384:39.65]Howdy, Jerm.
[384:40.03]I hope you're doing well.
[384:40.67]I want you to know that I really appreciate all the time and effort that's been put into the carnival by you and everyone else working on it.
[384:46.25]And that'll be absolutely worth it.
[384:48.26]Lots of love and have a safe flight.
[384:52.26]Yeah, I'm... I can't wait.
[384:59.01]This is the type of shit that I want to do fucking way more often, and this is the stepping stone to do it.
[385:08.10]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[385:12.24]Guild Hero, thanks for 10 bucks.
[385:13.68]Love you, Jermo.
[385:14.32]You always know how to make my bad days great.
[385:19.68]Well, I hope you have... I hope you have less of them.
[385:24.88]Hope you have more good days than bad.
[385:32.17]Thank you for the $10.
[385:32.95]Appreciate it.
[385:36.59]Take care of yourself.
[385:42.24]We also had $5 from Bone Jackal.
[385:47.46]Hey, Jerma, great stream as usual, buddy.
[385:49.24]But next time you turn on face game, you should probably scrub down your tongue first.
[385:55.91]What?
[385:57.21]I know this was the big community book stream, but you really didn't need to roll out the white carpet for us.
[386:03.30]What?
[386:05.18]What did I do?
[386:10.22]Scrub your tongue?
[386:13.13]What, did I have like gunk on my tongue?
[386:17.73]What was it?
[386:20.43]Does anybody know what they're talking about?
[386:25.51]I don't think I ever opened my mouth to show you my tongue.
[386:33.92]Disgusting tongue bacteria.
[386:36.58]What?
[386:36.84]It's just a joke.
[386:46.53]I'm assuming, but I don't even know what it's a reference to.
[386:53.37]Well, thanks for the $5, Bone Jackal.
[386:54.99]Appreciate it.
[386:56.41]Apple Shift, thanks for the $2.50.
[386:57.70]Hey, man, just want to say thank you for another wonderful stream.
[387:00.36]Let you know how much I'm looking forward to the carnival.
[387:02.72]I put it on my calendar and cleared my schedule.
[387:05.66]And although I haven't been here long, you genuinely improved my quality of life by a ton.
[387:09.90]You're a constant source of inspiration, comfort, and good vibes.
[387:13.52]And I cannot wait to see what you do next.
[387:14.87]Have a good one.
[387:16.73]Thank you, Apple Shift.
[387:18.85]We're happy to have new people.
[387:26.10]The more, the merrier.
[387:27.40]The more people, the merrier.
[387:35.24]I hope you enjoy the stream on Saturday.
[387:40.70]Thanks again.
[387:43.62]Hey, Skidder Leaf, thanks for the $5.
[387:45.94]They say Subway, Subway, Subway, Subway, Subway.
[387:48.81]For the bonus bits.
[387:50.25]Thank you.
[387:51.25]First time donator.
[387:52.45]Love your streams.
[387:52.97]They really help me get through my work days.
[387:55.29]Pikmin's my favorite video game franchise.
[387:57.01]It would mean the world to see you play one of them.
[388:03.70]Add these to the list.
[388:05.92]Jack and Dexter, the Pikmin stuff.
[388:11.26]Uh, see you at the carnival.
[388:13.98]See you at the carnival.
[388:17.81]Should be fun.
[388:23.41]Hey, Alamanda, thanks for the five dollars.
[388:25.71]Can't always make it to the streams because of uni, but I watched the VODs religiously.
[388:30.15]Thought I'd send some love.
[388:31.58]You deserve it.
[388:38.56]Thank you for the five dollars.
[388:41.56]Just somebody rolling in and dropping five bucks.
[388:47.36]Thank you.
[388:55.74]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[388:57.56]And then they subscribed right after that.
[389:00.22]Like, literally right after that.
[389:01.56]So, thank you again, back to back there.
[389:03.42]I have a little bit of a frog in my throat!
[389:10.59]Remember I told you that my face came on?
[389:11.99]I've burped like seven times since it's been off.
[389:18.03]And then Alamanda gave five community subs too.
[389:27.52]All in the span of back to back to back.
[389:30.84]They gave five dollars, they subscribed, and then they subscribed five people.
[389:35.65]Thank you.
[389:38.28]Thank you.
[389:38.70]That's... I... I still just can't believe.
[389:42.46]I can't believe it.
[389:45.78]I'm glad you have fun here.
[389:46.76]Thank you.
[389:50.12]Uh, we have... Uh... Joknai?
[389:54.85]For three bucks.
[389:55.49]They just say Kappa PogChamp.
[389:58.53]And then PogChamp again.
[390:01.91]Thank you for the three dollars.
[390:02.67]Appreciate that.
[390:04.93]Well, I don't think that's necessarily strange.
[390:06.46]What would be strange is the subject matter of all of those photos.
[390:26.67]Because let's say I was doing a thing where, hey, this is me.
[390:31.93]This is all my baby pictures all the way through when I was two into when I was five.
[390:36.96]Here's my first day of school.
[390:38.52]Here's to me and my friends.
[390:39.84]And you have hundreds of pictures like a collage of your whole life.
[390:42.64]People do that.
[390:44.84]The only difference is this is scary pictures of me manipulated to make me look as scary as possible.
[390:52.08]All over the last same time period.
[390:58.79]I think they would be more curious and concerned about that than the amount of pictures.
[391:09.07]But, yeah, probably, I don't know.
[391:11.43]Maybe they wouldn't say anything.
[391:14.65]But thanks for the $2.50.
[391:15.67]Dork you.
[391:17.41]Thank you Gnarly for the $2.50.
[391:18.53]Fun stream tonight.
[391:20.11]If that Booberry Jerma face doesn't become an emote, I'll piss.
[391:23.69]Can't wait for Saturday.
[391:24.49]Have a good week.
[391:25.79]It really should.
[391:27.29]It's too good.
[391:30.88]Have a good week to you, too.
[391:32.95]Hopefully we see you Saturday.
[391:35.19]Invader Z, thanks for the five dollars.
[391:37.05]These streams have made me laugh and smile harder more than I have in the last three years.
[391:43.02]And I'm so excited for the carnival, I took off work for it.
[391:47.16]I hear that frequently, that people have taken work off.
[391:50.64]Or taken time off of something to see this and do this.
[391:56.09]So...
[391:58.01]Hopefully, hopefully it's worth it.
[391:59.35]Hopefully you think it's worth it.
[392:00.73]That was worth doing.
[392:04.85]Thank you.
[392:08.41]Hey, Flugboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[392:09.93]They say, just to bring back this when I met you at PAX, I'm 5'9", and I'm slouching, and my friend on the left is 6 feet tall.
[392:21.69]Would you look at this?
[392:24.93]Interesting.
[392:26.57]Your friend on the left is six feet tall.
[392:30.05]Wow.
[392:31.35]I mean, I look like a fucking psycho in this picture, but I'm gonna put it on stream.
[392:39.13]Oh, this is the ultimate fucking proof.
[392:41.59]This is the ultimate proof.
[392:43.79]Thank you so much for giving this to me.
[392:58.16]Look at that.
[392:59.62]This dude's six feet tall right next to me.
[393:03.90]I mean, don't, don't, don't pay attention to like this fucking face.
[393:07.95]Holy shit, dude.
[393:20.56]I look like I'm fucking high.
[393:26.97]I'm just gonna leave this on for the rest of the stream.
[393:31.61]I've ruined the picture.
[393:32.95]No, I didn't.
[393:34.05]This is a good picture.
[393:36.34]Let me tell you, by comparison, this is a great photo of me.
[393:39.28]I take awful pictures.
[393:40.50]I can never take pictures.
[393:42.12]I look like shit in every photo I've ever taken of myself, ever.
[393:44.98]I look awful.
[393:45.84]I cannot take photos.
[393:48.55]I don't know what to do with myself.
[393:49.65]I could be on video all day.
[393:51.82]But the second that I have to have a still face... Nope.
[393:56.56]Not gonna happen.
[394:06.00]Here's that one image that you wanted.
[394:07.28]What do you mean?
[394:12.29]What's this one image?
[394:13.93]But thank you, Flugboy.
[394:14.79]For this one.
[394:17.13]Alright.
[394:19.17]Yes, I did want this image.
[394:21.25]Very desperately.
[394:37.18]I love it.
[394:38.06]Great.
[394:38.52]Good shit.
[394:39.93]But thank you, Flugboy, for that documented evidence and proof that I am a large person.
[394:46.15]Thank you.
[394:47.63]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[394:49.81]Jerma, I have to use the stupid sandwich emoji to give you extra money.
[394:54.31]What happened to the brain T-O?
[394:56.74]You're explaining it right now.
[394:57.88]Never mind.
[395:00.12]Thanks for the 250.
[395:04.82]Jerma Caveman.
[395:06.88]What's the context to use that, though?
[395:09.32]I feel like Jerma Caveman would show up less than jermaTV does.
[395:19.91]But thank you, C4G.
[395:22.01]Espada Escalada, thanks for the 250.
[395:23.73]Just want to say good luck on the Carnival stream, and I hope the flight goes smoothly.
[395:27.07]Looking forward to dunking you on Saturday before your robot army takes over the world.
[395:32.03]Good luck.
[395:35.04]It ain't gonna be easy.
[395:37.98]The English Alphabet, thanks for 10 bucks, a thousand bits.
[395:41.12]Germany, you're the best.
[395:42.02]Great stream.
[395:43.46]Thank you for always being you.
[395:48.42]Thank you, English Alphabet.
[395:54.19]I really appreciate it.
[395:57.67]And thank you for your $10.
[396:01.49]Another $10 came in from MaryGR.
[396:05.31]Thanks for all the fun tonight.
[396:06.13]Really love seeing all the love from the community and all the old references.
[396:11.68]No, it's great.
[396:13.71]There's a lot of people in this community that are really good at stuff.
[396:17.75]They're really talented artists here.
[396:19.95]Really, really funny people.
[396:21.49]Really funny fucking video editors and shit.
[396:23.69]You're everywhere.
[396:25.42]I have to do this stuff.
[396:29.12]You understand?
[396:29.84]Because you guys... You guys are so fucking funny and talented and... It's ridiculous.
[396:35.64]What, am I not gonna do something like this?
[396:40.65]I have to showcase it.
[396:47.12]Thank you, BibleBlack, for the 10 community subs.
[396:53.64]Right now.
[396:56.84]Thank you.
[396:59.16]10 more people just got subbed.
[397:01.28]Eventually... Eventually, everybody will be at this point.
[397:07.36]He did it.
[397:07.74]He said it.
[397:08.34]Jeremy, don't talk... What?
[397:09.09]What are you talking about?
[397:14.76]He said it.
[397:15.36]He said it.
[397:15.74]He said it.
[397:16.08]He said it.
[397:16.67]What did I do?
[397:19.89]It's a... It's porn.
[397:22.45]Oh.
[397:23.23]I don't know.
[397:26.31]But... Thank you, MaryGR, for the ten bucks.
[397:30.86]And also thank you for the tens community subs right there.
[397:33.44]From, uh, BibleBlack.
[397:36.92]I'm unaware.
[397:37.52]Whatever.
[397:38.18]I'm always unaware.
[397:38.95]That's how... I don't know.
[397:43.07]Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the five dollars.
[397:46.61]Five bucks from Pigeon.
[397:48.53]They say, put up a poster with your logo on it asking if anybody knew who you were.
[397:53.47]And if they did, to add me on Discord.
[397:56.41]Nobody responded saying they knew you.
[397:58.99]But still, you're a huge factor in determining who is a good friend material.
[398:02.22]Just something I think you should know.
[398:04.16]Put up a po- Where'd you put a poster up?
[398:09.86]What do you mean, poster?
[398:13.25]I put up a poster with your logo on it.
[398:20.25]Like on a telephone pole?
[398:21.79]Does anybody know this streamer?
[398:31.76]He's missing, call me.
[398:45.41]He's this tall.
[398:55.34]They also say, oh, they say two semesters ago in college.
[398:58.28]Right, there's the follow-up.
[398:59.14]Okay.
[399:04.72]Well, uh, there you go.
[399:16.72]Well, thanks for the five bucks, and I'm sorry that you didn't get any leads.
[399:23.88]But thank you.
[399:25.98]Hey, Pinwheel64, thanks for the six dollars.
[399:30.73]When are we going to get Ectoshack 2?
[399:33.19]Uh...
[399:39.44]I don't know.
[399:40.74]When are we gonna get any old, like, Newgrounds material that I did?
[399:44.98]When are we gonna get Sal- When am I gonna do SaltySwamp3?
[399:52.93]It's Jarrah's birthday soon.
[399:55.09]You answered Pinwheel's question.
[400:06.60]Bloydell's new stream over screen looks good.
[400:10.85]This is not it.
[400:13.70]No, I have a... You know, there's a lot of things.
[400:18.70]Old, you know, college and high school projects that I worked on before.
[400:25.14]Newgrounds stuff.
[400:28.50]All other things that I was doing when I was younger, you know.
[400:36.87]I am now me, and I just do me, and whatever the fuck I do is what I do, and that's pretty much it.
[400:41.99]I don't have a plan for anything.
[400:54.24]That's really important.
[400:57.78]If there's one thing you need to know about me that's very important, I don't have a plan for anything.
[401:02.42]I just kind of do whatever.
[401:05.74]My plans are usually, like, one month in advance.
[401:08.86]A week in advance.
[401:09.96]Potentially even a day in advance.
[401:16.18]I don't even have a plan for the 21st!
[401:17.58]Oh, shit!
[401:26.40]Oh, I'm gonna... I am fucked then!
[401:29.02]No, I'm kidding.
[401:31.68]But thank you, Pinwheel, for the $5.
[401:32.62]$6, actually.
[401:38.85]Pinwheel64.
[401:42.85]That's actually a pretty great username, I will tell you.
[401:47.88]Hey, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $2.50.
[401:54.08]Jeremy, I made a Louie Anderson emote in May of 2017 and completely forgot about it.
[402:00.60]I've recently rediscovered it and made it into a BTTV emote.
[402:05.16]Jeremy Louie.
[402:15.74]God.
[402:24.46]Louis Anderson.
[402:26.84]Do you have, like, a link?
[402:28.24]How do I see it?
[402:29.08]I want to see it.
[402:38.02]I need a link!
[402:42.23]You posted it.
[402:42.85]Where?
[402:45.30]Where the... It's not on the... It's not on the bit message.
[402:50.42]Oh, there it... No, is that it?
[402:55.04]Not everyone has BTTV.
[402:58.27]Oh, is this it right here?
[403:04.57]Well, there it is.
[403:06.51]Let's put it on the screen.
[403:07.41]Why not?
[403:14.05]Okay, I'm... Okay, I just realized this shit was still on the screen.
[403:21.57]That's gotta go.
[403:25.06]The first time I looked over at OBS in like 15 straight minutes.
[403:37.98]Well, there it is.
[403:46.56]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for revisiting back in 2017.
[403:50.41]Enable it.
[403:53.01]Enable it.
[403:54.45]I have to... I gotta fucking enable a lot of things.
[403:56.67]I really do.
[404:06.89]I'm just so slow to the punch on a lot of this stuff.
[404:12.78]But thank you.
[404:14.10]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the 250.
[404:15.12]Hey, Jerma, just want to wish you good luck at the carnival before you leave.
[404:18.09]Try not to cause a robot uprising while you're gone.
[404:20.79]I'll try.
[404:21.15]I will try.
[404:27.37]Hey, Shadsfen, thanks for the 250.
[404:33.65]Jerma, a friend of ours wanted to flex on you by showing you their rebranding.
[404:38.69]What do you mean, rebranding?
[404:40.41]Like, for the business?
[404:42.19]You may be short, but we will always love you the same.
[404:44.19]Thanks for being my literal number one comedian.
[404:48.35]Flex on you by showing you his rebranding.
[404:51.83]Oh.
[404:53.09]Okay, I probably should have seen that coming.
[405:03.20]I could have seen that coming.
[405:04.16]I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[405:08.32]There it is.
[405:14.34]Louis just moved.
[405:16.57]What the fuck are you talking about?
[405:22.85]Thank you to Shadsfen for that.
[405:25.71]Appreciate it.
[405:29.07]Thank you also to Sir Newt for this $27 from Sir Newt.
[405:36.04]Thank you, Sir Newt.
[405:37.30]Really appreciate it.
[405:39.94]They say, enjoy my money, Jerma.
[405:45.75]I will put it to good use.
[405:47.67]I will try to put it to as much use as I can.
[405:50.51]However I can do that.
[405:53.01]That's a lot of fucking money.
[405:53.99]Thank you.
[405:56.85]Sir Newt.
[405:59.11]Whether it's a dollar, five cents, twenty-seven dollars, a hundred dollars, or zero.
[406:05.24]If you don't give money ever.
[406:09.29]Just, thanks for being here.
[406:10.15]Thanks for watching.
[406:11.23]That's... I wish that there was more that I could say.
[406:17.01]Whenever anybody gives me a lot of money, but whenever... You know, like, for instance, we're talking about, like, oh my god, somebody's, like, responsible for a thousand subs.
[406:24.12]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[406:29.42]I can't believe that somebody would give me 27 bucks.
[406:31.48]I can't.
[406:31.90]Like, I'm shocked.
[406:33.44]I'm floored.
[406:34.01]I'm humbled.
[406:35.59]Thank you for ever doing something like that.
[406:41.70]I hope I put it to good use.
[406:48.99]But thank you.
[406:53.54]Also, thank you to Appleship for the $2.50.
[406:55.74]One more thing.
[407:00.63]I was rewatching your tier list stream, and I just wanted to say that we both have the exact same order for Taco Bell.
[407:06.51]The cheesy gordita crunch with nacho cheese, Doritos, logos, tacos.
[407:09.98]Yes.
[407:11.00]That's the best thing on the whole menu.
[407:15.30]And I'd just like to thank a fellow man of taste.
[407:19.96]P.S.
[407:20.26]I'm 5'1", so if we ever met, you'd be 7 inches taller than me.
[407:23.94]See?
[407:24.10]See?
[407:28.16]See?
[407:30.35]Well, it don't matter how tall you are.
[407:34.25]Don't let anybody ever tell you how tall you are, how skinny you are, how big you are.
[407:39.31]Don't even listen to him.
[407:46.63]Take Louie off the screen.
[407:47.97]What are you... Will you guys relax?
[407:51.13]What are you doing?
[407:54.93]Take Louie off the screen.
[407:56.35]Okay.
[407:57.41]Louie is off the screen.
[407:58.41]Don't worry.
[407:58.77]What were you saying?
[408:03.12]Oh, the cheesy gritty crunch, right.
[408:06.12]No, it's absolutely the best.
[408:08.78]It is the best item on the whole menu.
[408:13.32]So, yeah, of course, it is the best.
[408:17.40]Thank you to Nikolai Does Gaming.
[408:20.84]Thanks for the five dollars.
[408:22.82]Appreciate it.
[408:23.48]Five bucks.
[408:25.60]And they say, love your content, man.
[408:30.91]Watch your second Jerma channel all the time and I hope to start tuning into your streams more.
[408:36.15]Yeah.
[408:40.61]Second channel is a huge, huge deal.
[408:46.48]It does such a good job at having people be able to see things if they can't catch streams.
[408:52.10]I'm so happy with it.
[408:58.13]If you catch more streams, then I'll be glad to see you.
[409:02.64]Thanks for coming around.
[409:07.78]Thank you.
[409:09.16]We also had $5 from Flugboy, who says, I will say, when I did meet you, I was quite surprised at you being pretty much the same height as me.
[409:22.71]The same height as you.
[409:25.53]Right?
[409:27.85]Uh, as the memes really did fuck with that har- Wait, wait, what'd you say?
[409:33.82]I will say when I did meet you, I was quite surprised at you being pretty much the same height as me.
[409:38.22]The memes really did fuck with that harsh thank you for showing my ugly mug on stream.
[409:48.78]Pretty much the same height as me.
[409:50.42]Yeah, I know, right?
[409:57.73]Don't ever listen to what anybody ever tells you on the internet, okay?
[410:01.73]Almost nine and a half times out of ten, this shit is not real.
[410:10.87]So, you gotta decipher what is real and what is fake.
[410:17.14]It's hard.
[410:18.50]But, thank you so much, Flugboy.
[410:20.02]I really appreciate that.
[410:22.02]We also had another $5 come in from NikolaiDoesGamingAgain.
[410:26.82]I don't have that emote.
[410:28.68]I'll link you pictures from my trip to Russia though, bud.
[410:31.52]Trip to Russia?
[410:36.53]Hope you have a good time.
[410:41.85]What are you guys saying?
[410:42.45]What are you guys saying?
[410:48.95]What?
[410:52.79]Help, help, help, help, help.
[410:54.27]Run from what?
[410:56.70]Louie's... Louie, Louie on screen.
[410:58.38]There's nothing... I'm looking at OBS right now.
[410:59.58]There's nothing there.
[411:09.04]You guys are going to need to relax.
[411:13.22]But thank you, Nikolai.
[411:14.50]Appreciate it.
[411:15.92]Bala Koala, thanks for the $6.60.
[411:16.88]Something... Is this something that I... Something that I said today?
[411:30.95]Oh, it's the clip that says I'm 5'4".
[411:35.25]That's not right.
[411:36.45]That is inaccurate.
[411:38.41]Why does this clip have 61,000 views?
[411:46.18]That's inaccurate.
[411:49.24]How many times did you guys watch this?
[411:54.34]Did... Did like a hundred of you guys watch this like 6,000 fucking times?
[412:04.55]10 of you guys watched this 6,000 times.
[412:09.74]Why does this have so many views?
[412:13.68]It was on Reddit.
[412:15.68]Why was this on Reddit?
[412:19.49]What does this... Why would this be on Reddit?
[412:25.39]Oh, God.
[412:31.73]Thank you for that.
[412:32.89]Appreciate it.
[412:34.87]And that is where the stream's gonna end.
[412:40.73]Take care, everybody.
[412:42.89]See you soon.
[412:43.45]Wish me luck.
[412:45.01]I got a lot of work to do.
[412:47.01]You'll see me again on Saturday for hopefully a really, really, really fun time.
[412:52.18]Hopefully.
[412:53.08]It will be.
[412:57.88]Take care, all of you.
[413:00.08]I'll see you soon.
[413:03.69]Enjoy the carnival.
[413:06.83]See you on the 21st.
[413:09.98]Take care.
[413:11.50]Good night.
[413:43.43]You never see any tall people there.
[413:45.13]Big and tall.
[413:50.73]I stopped at the big and tall.
[413:54.03]You never see any tall people there.
[414:02.66]You never run into anyone's knee.
[414:04.72]Boom.
[414:07.74]I love your canned corn.
[414:14.15]I, uh, I'll tell you this.
[414:16.43]If I get one more X on my clothing, I'm next year's Super Bowl.
[414:19.49]So, um... Quit putting Xs on the clothing.
[414:27.95]Try putting pictures of mammals in the different sections.
[414:33.26]Do you have this in a wildebeest?
