[00:05.29]Hey guys, how are you?
[00:10.07]ResidentSleeper.
[00:11.77]ResidentSleeper.
[00:13.39]I'm so hardly trying to get up.
[00:15.43]I'm trying to wake up.
[00:16.21]You know when you're like, yeah.
[00:19.77]I need to like... With aftershave.
[00:23.19]In fact, I did that already.
[00:25.37]Didn't work.
[00:25.75]You know what I'm talking about?
[00:30.72]You put aftershave in your hands, and you rub it together, and you go... Nobody has ever done that before.
[00:38.62]It's in every movie, with a kid that learns how to shave.
[00:41.23]That doesn't happen.
[00:42.47]I didn't even use aftershave.
[00:46.77]Until I was like 30.
[00:54.65]Anyways.
[00:55.45]Hi, how are you?
[00:55.95]How you doing?
[00:57.49]Hold on, let me move this for a second.
[01:05.08]Somebody just said, okay, buddy.
[01:06.76]Okay, buddy.
[01:13.08]Why is my mic in the wrong spot every time?
[01:14.78]I don't understand.
[01:19.45]Uh, hold on.
[01:19.93]Okay.
[01:34.12]I got my controller.
[01:36.02]I'm ready to go.
[01:36.62]Sorry, I am about 40 minutes late.
[01:39.36]I woke up 55 minutes ago.
[01:43.77]I was up all night last night for a bunch of different reasons.
[01:48.15]I've been very, very excited.
[01:52.79]Maybe if I'm honest, maybe a little overwhelmed by some things.
[01:58.79]Don't call me a 3k Andy.
[02:00.47]Just wait 10 minutes.
[02:02.16]Sorry, like when people talk about my low view count, it automatically just triggers a fucking rage response.
[02:10.80]Sorry, let's continue.
[02:15.82]Yeah, I was up all night last night, and I'll be real with you.
[02:18.05]There's a lot going on.
[02:22.27]God damn it.
[02:24.49]I'm trying to be real, and I do a fucking voice crack, and everyone's going to laugh at it.
[02:34.68]Without getting into details, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes in my life right now.
[02:40.41]All very, very wonderful things.
[02:43.37]Wonderful things.
[02:47.01]I'm not talking about just... Oh, he's talking about projects.
[02:50.22]There's a lot of great things going on.
[02:52.92]Some that I'll talk about soon, probably.
[02:54.84]Um...
[02:58.02]But I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.
[03:00.88]There's so many fucking cool things.
[03:03.42]And then I get up yesterday.
[03:05.32]Or the day before.
[03:06.88]And I see that I'm like on the front page of all of Reddit.
[03:09.52]With like 50,000 upvotes.
[03:11.08]The serial killer image.
[03:13.52]And like everybody thinks of a serial killer.
[03:17.95]And I gotta tell you.
[03:18.89]I gotta be careful with my next wish from the chat genie.
[03:24.99]Because...
[03:26.36]Oh, please, please, please.
[03:27.71]Oh, please.
[03:28.17]Oh, chat genie.
[03:28.89]Please make the stupid face go away that I don't like.
[03:33.47]The monkey paw curls.
[03:34.31]There it is.
[03:34.69]There's the Among Us face, right?
[03:37.02]Oh, please, please, chat genie.
[03:38.46]Please make the Among Us face go away.
[03:40.22]I don't like the sus guy.
[03:41.70]Okay, fine.
[03:43.18]You're every serial killer that's ever been combined together in an AI image.
[03:49.75]I am not going to use my third chat genie wish on anything else.
[03:55.89]And I thought about this in the shower.
[03:58.22]I was like, you know, alright, what if I wish for world hunger to be over?
[04:02.40]Right?
[04:04.22]Somehow, the monkey paw would curl.
[04:06.90]And we would all fucking die.
[04:10.04]And the aliens would come get us.
[04:12.16]And eat the soil in the ground.
[04:14.91]I'm not making any more fucking wishes.
[04:16.79]Never again.
[04:20.58]Like, aliens would find this planet a million years from now and the soil would be fucking so good.
[04:26.10]It would solve their alien world hunger.
[04:29.00]Nope.
[04:29.80]No more wishes.
[04:31.04]Zero.
[04:40.32]What is he talking about?
[04:41.02]I'm talking about the serial killer AI image.
[04:47.73]I was on the toilet.
[04:49.11]I'm not... I was taking a... Going to the bathroom on the second number.
[04:54.32]And I'm scrolling down.
[04:55.16]I didn't know it was there.
[04:55.98]This is the second time it was there.
[04:59.38]In a month.
[05:00.44]I'm sitting there.
[05:01.00]I'm going to the bathroom.
[05:01.82]I'm scrolling down.
[05:02.44]And I just see my, like... My, like, arrest picture.
[05:06.16]It has, like, 30-something thousand upvotes on the front page.
[05:11.55]I audibly gasped.
[05:13.71]It was like...
[05:19.05]That's how I found out it was there.
[05:24.34]I'm not wishing for anything else.
[05:27.54]Never again.
[05:28.78]Never again.
[05:29.36]This guy's ego is out of hand.
[05:39.77]No more wishes.
[05:40.65]I'm never asking for anything ever again.
[05:47.26]Why did you wish to be a serial killer?
[05:49.07]I didn't.
[05:53.41]I didn't.
[06:01.11]Yes, you did.
[06:02.03]I know I didn't.
[06:03.21]What are you talking about?
[06:04.11]You just wished for the sus face to come back.
[06:12.17]No, I did not.
[06:17.64]Do you wish to be sus?
[06:22.09]And I don't know, weirdly enough, me saying this, me like talking about this and being like, holy shit, I don't know if I like that one.
[06:28.85]There's gonna be like a combination.
[06:30.75]Nope.
[06:31.41]Don't say it.
[06:34.99]Don't say it.
[06:36.68]I'm not gonna say it.
[06:37.12]I'm done.
[06:39.04]Alright, let's play Saints Row 2.
[06:40.44]Hi guys, welcome to the stream.
[06:41.52]Nope.
[06:41.92]No!
[06:43.00]No!
[06:46.78]Okay, Saints Row 2.
[06:48.26]Coming up here.
[06:53.64]We're gonna go right where we left off.
[06:56.42]Which should be... I don't know.
[06:57.87]What are we?
[06:58.23]Like 5% of the way through the game?
[06:59.55]Does it matter which one we pick?
[07:08.15]Probably this one, right?
[07:09.03]Yeah.
[07:16.01]It's been a wild few weeks, few months.
[07:21.23]I'm very, very excited.
[07:22.65]I can't wait for all this stuff.
[07:26.68]I was up all night.
[07:27.52]I couldn't go to sleep.
[07:30.10]I forgot this is what the character looked like.
[07:31.58]Alright, what are the buttons again?
[07:37.07]Alright.
[07:39.63]Oh, shit.
[07:41.37]Okay.
[07:42.73]Should we do a mission?
[07:43.57]Let me get my bearings.
[07:44.75]Hold on.
[07:49.93]Let's sprint.
[07:54.41]Let's throw.
[07:55.05]Okay.
[08:05.18]What are you saying?
[08:05.76]Hold on.
[08:09.50]Somebody wrote something.
[08:10.34]They said they were very concerned about me.
[08:12.05]Hold on.
[08:15.21]What started out as a joke has escalated over the last few weeks into something concerning.
[08:18.05]A friend of mine began watching you at a friend's recommendation.
[08:21.20]She can- Alright, I'm not gonna- Nevermind.
[08:24.84]Oh, did the game crash or not?
[08:31.31]Webcam or naked?
[08:32.43]The second one.
[08:46.04]Shoot.
[08:48.68]Alright, let's go to... I forgot how fun this game was.
[09:00.47]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[09:01.43]I've got my coffee here.
[09:03.09]Let me take a sip.
[09:10.94]Alright, so...
[09:17.64]Let's take a look at the map.
[09:19.04]I could do this Ronin mission.
[09:21.28]I could go get some food.
[09:23.82]Oh, 15% off sale.
[09:24.38]Let's go.
[09:24.94]You know when you get up and you realize that you're supposed to be somewhere?
[09:40.90]And your body's in slow motion.
[09:42.74]Your brain is in slow motion too.
[09:47.44]And you always wake up and you go... Everybody does that.
[09:58.26]And then you have to close one eye and blink them a bunch of times because your eyes aren't ready.
[10:14.29]Yeah, that happened.
[10:15.37]Alright, what do we got?
[10:18.92]Put the gun away, please.
[10:20.82]Put the gun away.
[10:22.36]Whoa, wait a minute.
[10:23.04]Once you own a hood, you can buy a share of each business in that hood.
[10:27.04]Owning a share of the business will give you a discount on their items.
[10:30.60]I can own this place?
[10:33.87]5,000 bucks!
[10:36.59]Did I get it?
[10:36.93]I got it.
[10:42.31]You now get a piece of the action of this store and will receive $200 a day.
[10:47.13]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[10:48.71]I'm in the middle of a cutscene, dude.
[10:51.07]Leave me alone.
[10:55.75]They're coming back.
[10:56.43]No, they're not.
[10:59.64]Okay, so what is happening out here?
[11:15.95]Why am I this person now?
[11:18.73]I just became this person.
[11:20.66]What?
[11:24.74]What's going on?
[11:29.14]Okay.
[11:29.46]I got absorbed.
[11:34.26]So I get a discount here now.
[11:36.87]Yeah, we need some new clothes for sure.
[11:40.59]I gotta not be the Happy Wheels character.
[11:45.52]Alright, hats.
[11:46.06]What do we got?
[11:46.42]Alright, how about the 3D Movie Maker hat?
[12:08.36]Okay, I like these.
[12:12.38]Okay, shirts.
[12:16.66]Nothing looks correct on this character.
[12:19.10]Why is he screaming outside?
[12:23.17]What the fuck is happening?
[12:24.47]That one just looks like skin.
[12:29.71]Okay, over shirts.

[13:38.34]What the fuck?
[13:39.02]The game craft?
[13:40.04]Shit, I forgot about that.
[13:41.24]Somebody said the outfits crash the game no matter what.
[13:44.48]I... Whatever.
[13:45.04]I gotta go buy that place again.
[13:46.20]Fuck, come on.
[13:51.02]Alright, I'm never touching outfits.
[13:53.24]I forgot about that.
[13:53.94]If you touch it, if you look at an outfit, if an outfit gets previewed, it crashes the game every single time, no matter what.
[14:12.67]Okay.
[14:15.29]Well, should I save my money?
[14:18.27]Or should I not buy that place?
[14:22.62]A bunch of people saying go to the mall.
[14:24.10]Where's the mall?
[14:27.73]Up here?
[14:27.97]Alright, there's a mission over here, which I'll do that.
[14:32.95]It says mall on the map.
[14:41.02]It does.
[14:42.84]I end retail district.
[14:46.46]Boardwalk.
[14:47.56]Beach.
[14:47.68]Beach.
[14:50.66]No, I'm not going to the casino right now.
[14:52.30]No.
[14:53.00]It says mall.
[14:58.01]Yeah, but I... Okay.
[14:59.45]Yeah, it says mall, but it's covered up by like a flag.
[15:02.91]There it is.
[15:03.45]Okay, mall.
[15:04.11]Let's go that way.
[15:14.68]You can take a motorcycle into the mall.
[15:16.06]Oh, shit.
[15:16.42]We're definitely doing that.
[15:24.74]There's a funny costume store?
[15:26.00]Okay.
[15:28.36]I think I'm gonna take, like, the Hamburger Mobile.
[15:41.65]This dude, can I, like... No, it just looks cool.
[15:45.87]Oh, it audioed Rick.
[15:58.36]Alright, going to the mall.
[16:00.06]And then I'm going to, after that, I'm going to do the Ronin mission that's right there.
[16:02.88]Because everyone said do the Ronin missions, they're the best.
[16:14.11]A crushed lizard.
[16:16.41]Thanks for the 20.
[16:18.25]Community.
[16:19.95]Subs.
[16:26.35]Would you eat a hamburger with a fork?
[16:27.76]No.
[16:29.74]I'm not, I'm not a twisted, twisted fuck.
[16:41.15]What about pizza?
[16:44.29]Depends on the kind of pizza.
[16:45.62]A really sloppy soup pizza?
[16:47.00]Yeah.
[16:49.38]Maybe.
[16:49.88]Sometimes you have to.
[16:50.42]Alright, so this is the mall?
[16:56.80]Cool.
[16:57.12]Alright, so what's, where's the mall?
[17:00.03]What's this?
[17:02.89]Enter the Altar Depot shopping mall.
[17:08.11]Oh, shit.
[17:08.51]Okay.
[17:09.15]So, now here we are.
[17:15.38]What?
[17:15.86]I was watching.
[17:19.02]What was the matter?
[17:20.02]I was watching him do that.
[17:21.90]Okay.
[17:22.42]That was aggressive.
[17:23.24]It was.
[17:23.64]I'm not going to.
[17:24.44]That was aggressive.
[17:25.80]I bumped him.
[17:31.31]Wait, this roller skating?
[17:32.43]How come I can't?
[17:34.57]I have roller skates on right now.
[17:36.35]Can I do that?
[17:36.91]Oh, cool.
[17:45.82]Mall is... Oh, I almost just took that lady out.
[17:49.78]Alright, so where's the... Oh, there we go.
[17:51.86]I want to go over there.
[17:52.60]So we got to go take a right.
[17:54.96]Go down this way.
[17:56.11]It's over there.
[17:56.63]Does this hurt if I do this?
[17:59.11]Can I jump over this?
[18:04.28]The auto show?
[18:05.30]Cool.
[18:09.66]Yeah, alright, so we gotta go across.
[18:18.16]There are three stores in the mall that sell unique clothes.
[18:20.46]Oh, cool.
[18:29.27]I always feel weird when I do this in a mall.
[18:31.67]Anybody else relate to this?
[18:34.65]Sitting down in one of these benches, in one of these sofas, in the mall.
[18:38.00]It almost to me internally feels like I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be in the mall.
[18:44.00]I don't know why I have this thing in my brain where like if you're at mall you need to be walking around and like shopping and looking at stuff.
[18:50.00]I feel like sitting down - it's almost like what am I- why am I here? It feels weird.
[18:57.00]I feel like people are walking by and judging me like but pfft, you're not buying anything? You're sitting down in the bench?
[19:04.37]And the only way that you get a pass doing that is if you're holding an ice cream.
[19:08.91]Oh, okay.
[19:09.45]You've got an ice cream.
[19:10.61]You're shopping here, aren't you?
[19:12.53]You're like hanging.
[19:13.13]Okay.
[19:13.45]You've got an ice cream.
[19:14.09]You're fine.
[19:14.39]I don't know why I feel like that.
[19:25.78]Oh, like a pretzel.
[19:26.50]Yeah.
[19:27.04]Oh, you've got a big pretzel?
[19:28.22]Go ahead.
[19:30.60]Alright.
[19:32.36]Do not go to outfits, for the love of God.
[19:35.95]You are nuts.
[19:36.73]Okay, what do we got?
[19:42.94]The bike helmet, the cap.
[19:47.26]Dirt bike helmet.
[19:48.12]Why does this have a respirator?
[19:57.98]Should I get that one with a respirator?
[20:09.30]I want to be able to see his face, though.
[20:10.38]I like his... I want to see his face.
[20:16.18]I want this one.
[20:23.18]Solid silk shirt?
[20:25.94]Okay.
[20:26.54]Wait.
[20:26.90]Maybe.
[20:28.31]I'll come back to it.
[20:28.91]Oh, are these swishy pants?
[20:36.25]I loved swishy pants when I was younger.
[20:43.38]Guys, every single middle school in America, if you just sit there and listen in the hallway, just sounds like this.
[20:55.71]All the fucking kids walking around with these swishy pants on.
[21:04.83]Kind of want them.
[21:13.42]Blood vial?
[21:15.44]You can't even see it.
[21:16.16]I'm too big.
[21:16.60]I forget without the hat.
[21:23.43]I gotta take the hat off.
[21:24.49]It's so much better without the hat on.
[21:28.41]It's so much better.
[21:29.51]A million times better.
[21:38.16]I have to take... Ah, that just hurt.
[21:40.34]Okay, hold on.
[21:42.83]Can I take off the hat?
[21:45.83]How do I get no hat?
[21:49.19]Can I?
[21:49.47]I think I have to go to my wardrobe, right?
[21:55.14]Don't touch outfits.
[21:57.66]How do I skip outfits?
[21:59.40]Okay, miscellaneous.
[22:02.47]Wallet chain?
[22:03.37]No.
[22:04.95]No tattoos.
[22:05.83]No, alright.
[22:06.31]Let's get out of here.
[22:14.52]Do suits count as outfits?
[22:16.74]I'm terrified to go look at it.
[22:17.90]I think so, yeah.
[22:26.31]No.
[22:26.53]Hmm.
[22:27.15]Suits are fine.
[22:27.85]Are you sure?
[22:31.09]Yes, they do.
[22:31.79]Alright, where is it going to go?
[22:41.28]Over here.
[22:41.52]I want to go this way.
[22:43.92]We gotta go downstairs.
[22:54.80]That'd be so fucked up if you saw that.
[22:56.02]Is it all the way down or is it straighter?
[23:03.69]Wait, there's a weapon store over here?
[23:05.01]There's a weapon store.
[23:16.34]I had to get it out of my system by punching the air first.
[23:21.47]Whoa, there's different stuff in here.
[23:25.01]Oh, shit.
[23:25.51]Alright, here we go.
[23:25.97]What do you got?
[23:26.33]I already have that.
[23:31.16]SMGs, shotguns, rifles, special, throne.
[23:34.48]No, you don't have anything new.
[23:35.67]Get out of here.
[23:47.65]What the fuck?
[23:49.78]What?
[23:51.54]Increase elevation, decrease elevation, rotate the helicopter.
[23:56.08]Why am I in this?
[24:02.26]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[24:04.10]I'm trapped, I'm trapped.
[24:08.94]Holy shit, you don't even care.
[24:12.26]Can I flip it?
[24:19.13]I can't flip it.
[24:21.25]No, it's over.
[24:21.87]I've ruined it.
[24:23.15]No, I've ruined it.
[24:25.51]What the hell?
[24:32.75]Whatever.
[24:33.73]That's why you wanted me to come here.
[24:35.69]It's been like 10 straight minutes of build up of you telling me to go to the mall.
[24:39.19]For me to flip it in less than 2 seconds.
[24:46.28]Just reload the save.
[24:50.51]What?
[24:51.21]What did you say?
[24:52.97]Who said that?
[24:53.49]I want to see where the other store is, though.
[25:01.78]I can't reload.
[25:02.82]It's not even going to put me in the mall.
[25:06.58]You guys are shit crazy.
[25:07.60]Watch this.
[25:16.26]More can spawn.
[25:16.96]Okay, cool.
[25:17.40]I'll just come back.
[25:21.12]Reload the gun, not the save.
[25:22.98]Wait, I'm going the wrong way.
[25:31.11]Where is this place?
[25:31.69]Down here, okay.
[25:35.67]Why am I so- I'm so out of breath every second.
[25:40.51]Hurry up.
[25:46.63]I watched Ernest scared stupid and it sucked.
[25:49.99]Get outta here.
[25:50.81]You don't even know anything about movies.
[25:53.65]What do you know about movies?
[25:54.76]Alright, I'm sorry.
[26:07.05]The Ernest franchise is better than the entire Phase 4 of Marvel.
[26:10.45]I'm just gonna be honest.
[26:11.33]What happened?
[26:12.19]What?
[26:22.08]Like, the Ernest Cinematic Universe Phase 1 I think is better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4.
[26:27.26]I think that's not, like, an unpopular opinion.
[26:31.29]How do I get rid of this guy?
[26:32.25]Oh, I'm on the wrong side.
[26:42.96]Can I just beat this guy up?
[26:51.72]Does anybody care that I did this?
[26:52.72]I don't think so.
[26:54.46]Alright, hurry up.
[26:54.84]Let's go.
[27:01.27]The Eternals.
[27:02.19]The scared stupid.
[27:15.56]What do you think is going to happen with Marvel?
[27:21.89]Do you think there's going to be a phase 5?
[27:23.43]Like phase 6?
[27:23.95]I don't know.
[27:26.89]I wonder.
[27:35.21]Oh my god!
[27:35.73]I don't want to go too fast because I don't want to attract attention.
[28:00.55]I don't want to attract attention, so I gotta go slow.
[28:16.58]Oops.
[28:17.48]Okay, this way.
[28:19.39]How are you still alive?
[28:20.33]I just hit you with a fucking sledgehammer.
[28:22.57]What?
[28:23.77]No, I don't want to shoot.
[28:24.45]I didn't even shoot him.
[28:25.35]The game did that on its own.
[28:27.25]The game, I swear to God, did that on its own.
[28:28.75]I didn't press any buttons.
[28:30.87]That was his decision, not mine.
[28:32.43]I didn't press that.
[28:34.03]I swear to God.
[28:34.95]I didn't press anything.
[28:37.20]Is that a chainsaw?
[28:42.36]Oh my goodness gracious.
[28:47.19]Alright, I'm sorry, but how do you advertise a chainsaw but not have it in sta- in- in- in store?
[28:53.55]Where's the chainsaw?
[29:10.36]Look at their ev- you have so many in stock, what the fuck?
[29:16.91]How do you not... Get away from me.
[29:23.75]How do you not have that in stock?
[29:25.93]That's annoying.
[29:30.07]I didn't even steal anything.
[29:31.29]Why did that alarm go off?
[29:34.23]I didn't take anything out of the store.
[29:37.46]What the fuck is that thing?
[29:40.48]I'm so sorry.
[29:40.94]I didn't mean to.
[29:58.72]Take the AT.
[29:59.20]I want the UFO.
[30:00.08]Is it back?
[30:00.70]Is it spawned again?
[30:06.92]I'll take a couple of donut holes.
[30:09.08]I'll take a donut.
[30:10.93]How do I get out of this without a problem?
[30:27.08]Get out.
[30:27.80]Leave me alone.
[30:34.19]Give me one of the little security wagons.
[30:37.53]What are you doing?
[30:39.01]Get in the security wagon.
[30:40.19]It's smaller.
[30:40.67]It's tighter.
[30:41.25]It's easier to maneuver.
[30:43.00]You got tighter handling.
[30:44.70]Stop!
[30:45.14]Oh my god.
[30:45.60]I'm going to fucking flip out.
[30:47.36]I'm sorry.
[30:47.86]I'm going to... Leave me alone.
[31:03.13]Alright, I went to the mall and nothing happened.
[31:04.91]I just wasted 20 minutes.
[31:13.14]I want to do a mission.
[31:19.60]Go back, please.
[31:20.98]Wait, can I take the UFO out of the mall?
[31:29.54]Misty Lane is under attack.
[31:32.68]What?
[31:34.41]What do you mean it's under attack?
[31:37.29]By who?
[31:38.59]Oh my god, wait a minute.
[31:41.02]I think this might be an Avengers level threat.
[31:45.10]I gotta go protect... I gotta go protect my home.
[31:47.40]I wanna play the Avengers theme song, but I feel like that would be like I would... They'd come after me somehow.
[32:09.59]Play the Ernest theme song.
[32:12.13]I don't think he even had a, I don't think he had a theme song.
[32:17.29]Hey Vern, I'm coming Ernest B. Worrell to save everybody down here.
[32:23.69]Now Vern, I have a sledgehammer.
[32:27.17]I'm gonna cock it back behind my back and swing for the fences Vern.
[32:42.53]It's an earnest level threat.
[32:43.75]Oh shit, we've got an earnest level threat here.
[32:52.06]That's so stupid.
[32:55.38]During a pushback, an enemy gang is trying to reclaim their neighborhood.
[32:58.97]The contested neighbor will be flashing on the city map.
[33:04.84]Okay.
[33:05.85]In order to retake the contested area, you must enter the neighborhood and kill the enemy lieutenants.
[33:08.93]Until you do, you will earn no money for controlling that neighborhood.
[33:12.83]Oh shit, that's actually a big deal.
[33:13.95]Alright, I gotta do this.
[33:31.47]Oh no, what about the caterers?
[33:37.86]This car, I can't even turn this car.
[33:41.14]This car is handling, I can't turn it.
[33:48.14]Wait, I have like a bazooka.
[33:49.90]I might as well use it.
[33:50.70]Where is he?
[33:51.00]Right there?
[33:54.74]What's alt fire?
[33:58.53]What's alt fire?
[33:59.11]How do I use?
[34:02.65]What is right click?
[34:17.07]Am I?
[34:17.25]Is this working?
[34:19.13]Can I not go through the fence?
[34:36.38]Oh shit!
[34:38.54]Got it.
[34:50.59]Oh my god, that's so far away.
[34:51.77]Stop!
[34:58.41]Whoa!
[35:00.70]Eat, eat, eat.
[35:01.36]I have like fucking cheeseburgers.
[35:02.84]Eat as many as I can.
[35:03.80]Alright, somebody just gave me a wedgie.
[35:11.43]That was the sound I just made.
[35:24.99]Alright, that lieutenant's gone.
[35:32.48]Alright, we gotta go.
[35:34.16]Is there a time limit?
[35:42.87]Why am I running here?
[35:43.75]I need to get a car.
[35:51.82]There we go.
[35:59.48]Get in the car.
[36:01.92]I want someone to come with me.
[36:03.02]What the fuck?
[36:03.82]Oh my god.
[36:04.66]I'm sorry.
[36:05.00]Shit.
[36:14.53]There's two lieutenants over here by the gas station or whatever this is.
[36:21.86]Stop.
[36:22.60]Stop it.
[36:24.94]Oh my goodness.
[36:25.72]He's trying to pull me out.
[36:31.01]There's so many.
[36:32.75]They sandwiched me in.
[36:33.81]Holy shit.
[36:36.13]I have to throw a grenade or something.
[36:37.75]Do I have any grenades?
[36:39.76]How do I not have grenades?
[36:47.20]Fuck.
[36:55.50]Did they get it?
[36:58.36]Not yet.
[37:00.25]Get back over there.
[37:01.15]Turn the sound up.
[37:05.13]Yeah, I'll turn the audio up on the game.
[37:07.54]Game audio is going up.
[37:13.86]I need to... No.
[37:15.26]I need ammo first.
[37:16.40]Because honestly, these weapons are not loaded very well.
[37:22.64]This game is too hard for you.
[37:24.10]No, it's not.
[37:24.82]The game is perfectly fine.
[37:27.14]What?
[37:38.97]Put on Christmas music?
[37:40.09]No.
[37:49.24]I love the earnest level threat.
[37:50.92]That's like my favorite thing so far today.
[37:58.78]I feel like my L. I get...
[38:06.78]Okay, take this out.
[38:08.90]I have money that I've collected, don't I?
[38:11.56]In a stash somewhere?
[38:15.98]Please move.
[38:18.60]Why are you suddenly Ernest's number one fan?
[38:21.92]I don't think that's suddenly.
[38:22.86]I think I've made it pretty clear over the years that Ernest is one of the most talented showmen.
[38:37.09]One thing that I'm really afraid of is them doing, like, a young Ernest.
[38:40.75]Right?
[38:41.23]Like, I don't want them to make another Ernest movie.
[38:42.97]Don't replace Ernest.
[38:43.77]Don't make a new Ernest.
[38:45.11]Right?
[38:45.39]Don't do that.
[38:46.31]There's really a lot of potential for that to happen.
[38:48.53]I feel the same way about Gumby.
[38:50.01]Don't do Gumby again.
[38:50.85]They're gonna do it.
[38:51.55]I hope they don't.
[38:52.07]Are they upstairs?
[39:07.08]Oh, fuck.
[39:07.62]I need a flashbang or something.
[39:08.90]Don't I have flashbangs?
[39:10.02]I bought like three of them.
[39:11.66]What the fuck?
[39:19.07]How much bullet?
[39:19.67]This is one bullet?
[39:21.47]Shoot the gun!
[39:26.13]I'm not ready for this one.
[39:27.28]This is too much.
[39:27.76]What was that?
[39:47.29]There's still another, here we go.
[39:48.21]Okay, good.
[39:50.74]There's one more person upstairs.
[39:52.00]Maybe not.
[39:58.34]Where are you?
[39:58.66]Are you down?
[39:59.68]Did I run by this person?
[40:01.86]How did I?
[40:02.16]Alright, we're good.
[40:03.86]Move.
[40:05.68]Did I get one of these?
[40:14.36]Save.
[40:14.72]Holy shit.
[40:15.32]Thank you so much.
[40:17.79]That would have been a disaster.
[40:18.61]I would have quit.
[40:19.13]I would have literally quit streaming right there.
[40:21.69]Who the fuck are you?
[40:22.67]I need a car.
[40:36.44]Of course.
[40:36.90]Give me this car.
[40:45.56]I picked the car.
[40:46.80]This car is so old.
[40:50.10]Give me that bike.
[40:50.72]That's what I want.
[40:54.12]I can shoot off the bike.
[40:58.02]Go.
[41:01.68]I fucking hate.
[41:02.68]I'm quitting.
[41:03.70]I'm done streaming.
[41:06.34]Been a good run.
[41:07.54]It's over.
[41:08.24]I'm done.
[41:11.19]Get off of me.
[41:15.62]I have to stay on the bike.
[41:17.24]Jesus, what the fuck?
[41:18.70]How come I don't have any people here defending this with me?
[41:21.16]Why is it just Ernest?
[41:24.72]I understand that this is, like, my movie.
[41:27.64]And... Oh, where's Dr. Strain?
[41:29.78]He's off-world.
[41:30.64]Oh, what about Captain Marvel?
[41:32.48]Oh, out of galaxy.
[41:33.48]But, like, seriously, where the fuck are they?
[41:34.52]Where are the other Revengers?
[41:36.40]Get off of me!
[41:41.91]Get in!
[41:44.07]Is that the lieutenant?
[41:45.37]Oh, I got him.
[41:46.61]I didn't... Where is this person?
[41:52.86]I'm... Are they inside?
[42:10.74]That's it?
[42:12.88]No, I'm stuck in here.
[42:14.50]I'm in so much trouble.
[42:17.48]All the... You can call your gang in the pause menu.
[42:21.94]Oh, God.
[42:22.24]Well, I'm going to need them.
[42:26.27]Activities?
[42:28.53]Hitman?
[42:29.13]No.
[42:29.95]Diversions?
[42:31.75]Where is it?
[42:35.99]Ernest starts a gang war.
[42:38.43]The phone?
[42:40.36]Where's my phone?
[42:41.04]How do I get the phone?
[42:50.60]It's tab?
[42:51.46]What's that on controller?
[43:01.31]Select?
[43:02.87]It's in the menu.
[43:05.26]Oh, fuck.
[43:06.00]Okay.
[43:06.40]Alright, phone.
[43:08.64]I need, uh, okay, homies.
[43:10.90]Call.
[43:11.79]I don't have any friends.
[43:16.69]Who do I call?
[43:23.71]Should I call the police?
[43:27.44]Does that work?
[43:28.78]No, I don't want the... I'm doing... I'm bad.
[43:30.84]I'm doing bad things.
[43:43.34]I want a different gun.
[43:43.94]I think I cleared it out.
[43:48.34]Alright, we're good.
[43:58.80]I need to make some friends.
[43:59.64]Hey, there's a friend.
[44:06.32]Help me.
[44:09.88]This one sucked.
[44:10.54]I gotta hide somewhere.
[44:12.18]I'm gonna put the car up right here.
[44:13.42]And then hide behind it.
[44:16.00]As cover.
[44:19.67]This is such a bad idea, isn't it?
[44:20.79]That was gonna be so cool, but I missed every shot after that.
[44:28.82]Fuck.
[44:56.98]Look at how many people are here.
[44:58.54]How am I supposed to do this on my own?
[44:59.52]Is there anything back here I can use?
[45:03.32]Look at the trail.
[45:15.93]How do you hit that fence?
[45:17.11]Come on, no!
[45:21.77]Eat something, eat something quick.
[45:33.28]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[45:35.58]Give me a break.
[45:37.88]I'm about to drive up there.
[45:49.72]Fuck, there's too many.
[45:52.62]They're just appearing now.
[45:54.41]Get in the car, get in the car.
[45:56.65]Please.
[45:57.01]Don't.
[45:59.33]Eat something quick.
[46:08.99]How am I supposed... I don't understand how I'm going to do this.
[46:13.96]They don't stop.
[46:14.80]There's more gang members right here than there are people that live in this whole city.
[46:18.18]They keep coming.
[46:18.84]Did I get them?
[46:23.66]I got everybody.
[46:24.12]Go.
[46:24.24]Go.
[46:37.32]Please just get me.
[46:38.72]Yeah, nice shot.
[46:39.50]You got him.
[46:44.42]Don't.
[46:46.08]They're relentless.
[46:47.34]They're relentless.
[46:48.90]They're relentless.
[46:50.56]I can't get away from them.
[46:53.50]They're relentless.
[46:56.02]I can't stop this.
[46:58.10]What the fuck?
[47:04.95]That was ridiculous.
[47:05.95]They were glued to my bumper.
[47:10.94]Actually glued to the bumper, and I have to go back and do this again?
[47:13.82]Oh, I'm going to... No, get weapons first.
[47:16.84]I keep losing money.
[47:17.64]Alright, snap this person's neck, because I'm pissed right now.
[47:23.61]Okay.
[47:36.59]Okay.
[47:37.29]I want weapons.
[47:38.75]Give me weapons.
[47:39.51]I'm not going over there with the double magnum.
[47:42.94]It's not going to happen.
[47:46.16]Which store has good weapons?
[47:48.60]Brass Knuckles is good.
[47:49.69]I think there's one here too, isn't there?
[47:51.25]Let's find out.
[47:53.69]Oh, do the fight club?
[47:54.57]Don't worry.
[47:54.93]We've got plenty of time.
[48:05.98]Go do insurance fraud.
[48:13.78]Maybe in a little bit.
[48:25.43]Just load the save.
[48:26.83]I guess that would give me $17,000, but I have to sleep in the bed that I made, don't I?
[48:31.09]I can't just... I gotta live with this.
[48:37.21]Somebody said if I do this.
[48:38.43]Let me see.
[48:39.15]Does this work?
[48:43.01]Oh, hell yeah.
[48:44.83]Finally.
[48:46.25]How many can I have?
[48:48.21]Alright, I got one member.
[48:52.35]Finally.
[48:52.75]Let's go get some weapons.
[49:06.68]Clothing.
[49:07.14]Is this a weapon store?
[49:09.10]I have to reveal these on the map.
[49:10.54]Let's see.
[49:11.76]No.
[49:11.92]Alright, is this a weapon store?
[49:16.91]That one's melee.
[49:26.15]Name him?
[49:33.22]Uh...
[49:36.39]That's lame.
[49:50.98]You don't care.
[49:53.30]Is this a weapon store?
[50:00.03]Does he use a shotgun?
[50:01.79]No, he's non-violent.
[50:08.46]Alright, it's right here.
[50:22.66]Get rid of that sussy shotgun.
[50:29.08]That shotgun really is awful.
[50:30.50]Woohoo!
[50:35.62]Okay, that's not it.
[50:36.46]Where are the other weapon stores up here?
[50:38.27]There's only one?
[50:38.91]What the hell?
[50:47.75]I'm just going to keep looking for one.
[50:50.71]One in the mall?
[50:53.20]I guess that's right, but I don't want to go in the mall.
[50:55.12]Why did I say it like that?
[51:15.59]I think it'd be fun to ride on a motorcycle with somebody.
[51:20.54]Am I getting more respect because somebody's watching me do this?
[51:23.50]No, that's not one.
[51:33.95]That's a clothing store.
[51:37.77]And... God damn.
[51:39.67]Shit.
[51:46.06]I guess I'm gonna have to go to the mall.
[51:50.17]This is one over here, right?
[51:53.73]Right?
[52:03.18]Right?
[52:07.32]Stop cursing?
[52:07.78]Okay.
[52:08.66]Alright, every time I curse... No, I'm not doing that.
[52:15.25]That'd be fun, though.
[52:23.81]I thought this game was about boating.
[52:25.10]Dude, I was going to name the stream... Row, row, row your boat.
[52:32.26]But that was probably not very good.
[52:34.04]And it probably wouldn't have been that funny.
[52:35.76]So I just said, serving up some fresh games.
[52:38.99]My voice is gone.
[52:40.15]Already.
[52:40.41]I didn't even do anything.
[52:41.15]Because I just woke up.
[52:50.81]It's a hamburger joint...
[52:54.59]We'll end up just going to the mall.
[52:56.11]We're going to wrap around to it already.
[52:58.25]It's inevitable that we're going to go there.
[53:03.88]It's 3.30 p.m.
[53:04.30]and you just woke up.
[53:05.32]Well, I woke up at like 1.40?
[53:07.86]I was up all night.
[53:09.82]A Tesla?
[53:14.31]What is this place?
[53:14.87]How would you like to make your mother proud, dear?
[53:25.41]Oh, it's tattoos.
[53:26.41]Okay.
[53:26.67]I thought it was a Tesla logo.
[53:42.05]There we go.
[53:42.71]That's what I want.
[53:43.27]Let's go.
[53:45.35]Hahaha.
[53:53.24]I just love that.
[53:59.86]Please bring that back.
[54:01.04]It makes me look tough Don't crash He didn't even crash he's dead I didn't that wasn't barely a crash right that that was nothing I
[54:22.32]Oh my God.
[54:23.15]That was nothing.
[54:27.55]I wasn't even going.
[54:28.15]That was, I was going two miles per hour.
[54:29.61]Why would we fly off like that?
[54:31.03]There's a diamond.
[54:38.78]Okay.
[54:46.88]There's the mall.
[54:49.26]Let's go.
[54:51.47]Wait, I have to see if he can hit his head on this.
[54:52.69]Does that be funny?
[54:53.59]Okay, so if I drive straight from here, I wonder if I can like take his head off.
[55:03.81]Okay, ready?
[55:05.01]It needs to be right here.
[55:14.39]I mean, he scraped his head, but not really.
[55:23.73]Where's the entrance?
[55:24.93]Right here?
[55:25.59]Mall entrance.
[55:28.54]No, there's like a front door.
[55:29.50]Where is it?
[55:29.82]This thing goes too fast.
[55:46.75]Just go in?
[55:47.35]Yeah, but there's a front door.
[55:49.55]Can't I just go in?
[55:54.42]I think it's up.
[55:56.11]Where's the entrance?
[56:12.71]There was a huge sign for mall entrance and you didn't go in it.
[56:16.83]I can't even!
[56:18.18]Alright, I'm fucking seriously considering.
[56:20.44]Fucking just abandoning that area.
[56:22.90]I don't care if we lose it.
[56:24.80]It's like $100 a day.
[56:26.48]I'm going to go do a mission.
[56:28.20]It's right here.
[56:28.58]We're doing a mission.
[56:32.70]I need like seven people to be in a car with me.
[56:36.86]I'm just going to go do a mission.
[56:45.19]Mall entrance is beneath you.
[56:50.71]You can't lose areas.
[56:51.98]Oh.
[56:52.16]Well, they made it seem like there was, like, time limit.
[57:05.52]Oh, no.
[57:05.88]Double barrel is gone.
[57:11.08]Oh, shit.
[57:11.34]That's right.
[57:11.70]Poor double barrel.
[57:12.80]He didn't last five minutes.
[57:27.21]Alright, let's do a mission.
[57:32.89]So I gotta take out the porn servers?
[57:58.07]uh yeah I um I don't think I don't know about about this one maybe we should uh attack one of their other site or one of their other zones I don't think this is going to do very much I don't I think we should hit him somewhere else I don't have any weapons
[58:30.58]What's this, an airplane?
[58:31.32]I don't have any food either.
[58:36.72]And of course, of course you're just gonna show- I have to take your guns.
[58:45.75]Give me their weapons.
[58:46.37]Their weapons are better.
[58:47.17]They're faster.
[58:56.17]That's- oh my god, why did I not do that in the first place?
[58:58.09]Are you kidding me?
[58:59.79]No, put that person down.
[59:00.91]Put that person down.
[59:01.75]I'm not going to shoot that person.
[59:02.81]Get out.
[59:15.16]Revive, please.
[59:17.42]This person is walking around with a newspaper.
[59:19.04]What are you doing, man?
[59:32.30]Good.
[59:32.64]Alright.
[59:34.80]I thought that was a bad guy.
[59:35.72]I thought, sorry.
[59:36.28]I'm really sorry.
[59:36.78]I'm really sorry.
[59:37.24]I'm really sorry.
[59:37.74]But what?
[59:38.34]Get out of here.
[59:40.02]I didn't.
[59:40.34]I thought that was a bad guy.
[59:41.14]I really did.
[59:42.08]He had like a shirt on.
[59:44.00]Alright.
[59:46.42]Can I order food from this?
[59:47.38]I can.
[59:58.53]Where did you come from?
[60:06.80]I shot that guy because he was wearing a shirt.
[60:08.10]No, he ran at me.
[60:10.47]Okay, we're good.
[60:22.69]What the fuck was that?
[60:26.31]What's going on down there?
[60:30.38]You see the indicator?
[60:37.26]Is somebody in here with a bike?
[60:42.62]Alright, where's that server?
[60:51.60]This way.
[60:59.04]Oh.
[60:59.82]What is going on?
[61:02.63]Look at the minimap.
[61:03.35]What the fuck is that?
[61:07.83]I need to see.
[61:08.29]There's nothing there.
[61:15.69]It's cars beneath you.
[61:17.23]Oh, but... I thought it was a helicopter too, yeah.
[61:33.12]I didn't even mean to shoot that guy, but whatever.
[61:34.70]Alright, destroy the servers.
[61:40.23]That's not a server.
[61:40.87]That was a gas tank.
[61:41.69]I thought it was a server.
[61:51.14]Alright, here we go.
[61:56.73]They don't know you can shoot through glass.
[62:00.23]Not this glass.
[62:01.53]I just alerted all of them.
[62:02.81]Alright, we got a bunch of them up here.
[62:14.30]Hey, leave me alone.
[62:21.04]This is the standoff.
[62:24.28]Come on, open it.
[62:25.50]Open the door.
[62:26.02]Open it.
[62:26.42]I dare you.
[62:28.08]I dare you to open this door.
[62:29.28]Go on.
[62:31.24]You won't do it.
[62:32.56]Can they not open?
[62:39.00]I can't get hit.
[62:39.88]Let's just...
[62:49.44]Imagine like you're in the middle of a gigantic like action shootout and you're the guy that dies by getting hit in the face by an empty recycling bin.
[63:12.57]I don't know what that was but whatever.
[63:24.92]No, not the porn.
[63:28.72]I got to get out.
[63:29.74]Head for the doors.
[63:32.96]I'm out of bullet.
[63:33.92]I got to reload.
[63:35.24]There's definitely going to be a confrontation outside.
[63:36.69]Is that it?
[63:46.65]I feel like way more people were shot in here.
[63:48.44]Give me this thing.
[63:55.08]Alright, here we go.
[64:03.83]Perfect.
[64:04.47]That's like seven years of bad luck, whatever.
[64:06.17]I don't want to worry about that.
[64:13.65]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[64:15.32]Please get up.
[64:25.64]You can play that game.
[64:27.48]Get the ammo.
[64:36.71]This game's hard.
[64:49.09]Sign.
[64:50.84]Oh shit.
[65:05.44]Go!
[65:16.39]I barely hit any- What just fell over?
[65:24.13]Yeah, this is kind of how I feel like when I used to play Left 4 Dead.
[65:28.94]So Left 4 Dead really can only work if you all are holding the piece of furniture together.
[65:33.32]And not one person's holding all the furniture, right?
[65:36.10]But man, there were so many times where I was just kind of lazy.
[65:38.45]And was just kind of shooting around everything.
[65:40.35]Just kind of shooting bullets so people knew that I was playing.
[65:42.93]Okay, wait.
[65:58.99]Yeah, because you have four people, all four of you have to pull your weight.
[66:03.15]If not, you're gonna lose.
[66:04.68]If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living room, all four of us have to pull our weight or it's gonna be, someone's gonna be, it's gonna be bad.
[66:13.40]You're always the dead weight.
[66:14.80]I think one of the helicopters crashed.
[66:15.90]That's a very simple concept, what are you talking about?
[66:21.81]If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living room, we all have to put weight into it so not one person does everything and you can't- not one per- one person can't lift a couch.
[66:44.51]Oh my fucking god.
[66:45.45]That guy just jumped.
[66:55.46]I thought you were talking about holding furniture in the game.
[66:58.58]Like in Left 4 Dead.
[67:04.79]You know, that actually would be kind of a fun game.
[67:07.45]What do I have to do?
[67:12.31]Like carry furniture together?
[67:14.42]Simulator?
[67:14.88]That might be fun.
[67:15.44]What am I supposed to do about this?
[67:29.59]Oh, that was a bad idea.
[67:35.77]Where's the explosion?
[67:36.33]Why was that one a dud?
[67:39.11]Holy fucking shit.
[67:40.27]That was bad.
[67:40.88]This is really bad.
[67:43.70]What do I do?
[67:44.18]I have to take this out?
[67:53.02]Did I miss something?
[67:53.60]I have to go back to the bridge.
[67:59.62]Really?
[68:06.96]No, I can just shoot it.
[68:07.74]I'd be great if I had any bullets for any gun.
[68:10.90]And it takes a hundred years to reload this.
[68:15.71]It's finally reloaded.
[68:16.61]Jesus Christ!
[68:20.91]Oh my god!
[68:21.47]Oh my god!
[68:22.49]Oh my god!
[68:23.41]Oh my god!
[68:27.11]This thing's still not reloaded.
[68:28.53]This gun's so bad.
[68:29.49]Why did I get two of these?
[68:30.43]What a stupid idea.
[68:31.35]Do I have grenades in this?
[68:36.02]This is so bad.
[68:38.32]I need a gang member.
[68:40.06]Yeah, I'll be back.
[68:40.90]Do I have any gang members?
[68:49.38]I had grenades.
[68:53.17]I got it.
[68:53.55]Don't worry.
[68:53.89]I'm just gonna slowly take them out.
[69:03.95]Watch out.
[69:05.71]I think they despawned.
[69:06.65]Yeah, they do.
[69:07.09]They despawned.
[69:13.54]I want that machine gun.
[69:14.82]Alright, come here.
[69:22.20]Got it.
[69:25.72]Nice.
[69:32.76]It's an easy two grand, I think.
[69:34.90]That was an hour later.
[69:37.94]I'll be here all day.
[69:49.80]No, you won't.
[69:50.74]Don't call me out on things that are true.
[69:52.70]Got it safe.
[69:53.60]We're good.
[70:01.65]What the, what the hell is that?
[70:06.11]What is this like animated emote of like me with that like a handsome filter?
[70:10.19]Where'd you get that?
[70:12.17]How do you have that?
[70:13.21]Whose is that?
[70:16.23]Where'd you get that?
[70:20.13]I'm so confused.
[70:29.35]You finally saw it.
[70:30.49]Someone else put it on their channel.
[70:38.16]That's illegal!
[70:45.08]That's illegal!
[70:55.83]Okay, now what?
[70:59.43]Okay, it's time to go to the weapon store in the mall.
[71:02.78]Go buy a bunch of ammo and grenades and shit.
[71:06.10]Don't walk around the entrance and go, I don't know where the entrance is.
[71:10.42]Just go in.
[71:10.92]Don't be an idiot.
[71:13.28]You're good.
[71:14.10]Okay.
[71:32.62]You have to name this friend.
[71:38.73]Sean Silencer.
[71:39.53]How come they always have to have such, you know, bad like weapon kill hurt names?
[71:58.34]Why can't it be like tree planting Andy or something?
[72:13.75]Yeah, like Carl Conservationist.
[72:26.32]That's hippies.
[72:27.04]Alright.
[72:34.13]How do we get into the mall?
[72:37.37]How do I get into the mall?
[72:38.91]I'm so dumb.
[72:39.93]I'm sorry.
[72:48.23]Mall entrance.
[72:48.87]I'm just gonna go here because this is underground though.
[72:50.91]I don't want to go in the garage.
[73:09.01]You can take the UFO through here.
[73:11.41]Really?
[73:11.65]Holy shit.
[73:26.35]This is it?
[73:33.43]Why would there be an opening for cars to the actual mall?
[73:37.15]Alright, where's the weapon store?
[73:46.84]Right here.
[74:03.15]Holy shit, that was cool.
[74:08.70]Okay, load up.
[74:10.04]I'm not fucking around now.
[74:11.46]I'm seriously not messing around.
[74:15.74]Let's go.
[74:16.88]I want... Okay, I have one of these.
[74:20.66]Dude, is there something I'm missing?
[74:22.02]Get rid of this 12 gauge.
[74:22.98]Put the tombstone back on.
[74:26.48]Flashbangs.
[74:27.09]10 flashbangs.
[74:34.74]Alright, I want SMG ammo.
[74:40.64]I'm using all my money.
[74:42.43]I don't care.
[74:43.41]Use it all.
[74:44.15]I need to be able to do this.
[74:47.65]What if I die?
[74:48.17]Okay, melee I want.
[74:58.19]This is good.
[74:58.67]Pistol I want.
[75:00.60]Probably the... Hmm...
[75:05.20]Yeah.
[75:05.94]Double vice 9s.
[75:07.96]SMG.
[75:08.71]How is there no SMG available?
[75:11.25]What?
[75:13.39]Tombstone.
[75:16.61]Whoa.
[75:17.03]What's that?
[75:19.29]AR-40?
[75:22.40]Which one's better?
[75:22.90]50 is higher than 40, so I'm going to say 50.
[75:27.38]Okay.
[75:38.98]Do I have enough ammo?
[75:41.58]I'm going to get pistol ammo.
[75:45.06]I have a ton of... I have no money.
[75:48.18]I'm out of money.
[75:51.65]I used $15,000.
[75:52.75]Was this worth it?
[75:57.95]Where's my buddy?
[75:58.73]Let's go.
[76:01.55]Where's the UFO?
[76:02.37]Can he get in the UFO too?
[76:06.93]Where's the UFO up?
[76:12.11]Didn't buy pistol ammo.
[76:14.91]I mean, I have almost a thousand rifle ammo.
[76:16.75]I think I'll be alright.
[76:20.23]Where's that UFO?
[76:25.11]What spot's the UFO in?
[76:26.07]Down here?
[76:26.33]In front of the burgers?
[76:33.01]Where is it?
[76:37.34]Turn around.
[76:37.72]Is it right here?
[76:47.84]Oh, right.
[76:56.60]This way?
[76:59.44]I just saved.
[76:59.85]I did.
[77:02.41]Unedited Andy in the top right.
[77:04.29]What do you mean unedited?
[77:05.19]That's where one of the cars is.
[77:08.57]I think it's right here.
[77:16.27]Shit, it's not right there.
[77:17.33]Where is it?
[77:17.75]Down there?
[77:24.44]Right ahead?
[77:28.10]I'm not gonna shoot anybody.
[77:29.10]I'm just using the C for... Whoa!
[77:30.88]What's this place?
[77:44.21]That's good.
[77:46.23]That's good too.
[77:47.85]That's good.
[77:51.13]No, I want to be able to see the face.
[77:55.93]A fireman.
[77:58.95]Whoa.
[78:04.36]This looks like a chef hat.
[78:10.42]Cat ears.
[78:11.08]The lizard.
[78:20.15]Hold your helmet.
[78:21.91]Viking helmet.
[78:25.13]No.
[78:26.73]If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do the... I want to be able to see the hair.
[78:38.82]What?
[78:50.61]Scrubs?
[78:54.13]I can't look at outfits though.
[78:56.83]Please do ski mask.
[79:13.26]Oh my god, this is... This is Matthew Lesko.
[79:17.84]Hey everyone, me, Matthew Lesko.
[79:19.14]And I mean, I got these crazy government things you can get.
[79:21.45]You want to go to $20,000 to go back to school.
[79:24.29]I can get that for you.
[79:26.00]$40,000 to start a new job.
[79:27.96]I should be Matthew Lesko.
[79:29.36]I really should.
[79:46.28]Chats to Zoomer to know who Matthew Lesko is.
[79:48.56]It's great.
[79:52.77]It's funny.
[79:53.15]Matthew Lesko is actually a really, really, like, wonderful person.
[80:04.05]Hmm.
[80:06.49]Free money, yeah.
[80:11.41]You know him?
[80:12.23]No, I don't... Alright, yeah, okay.
[80:14.48]I don't know him, but he seems like a really, really nice person.
[80:18.92]Parasocial Andy.
[80:19.86]No, I'm just saying, like, the way that the person's presented... Just quiet, or I'm gonna... I'll ban everybody.
[80:27.84]Parasocial... I kinda want the lab coat.
[80:36.51]Flasher coat?
[80:40.97]Oh...
[80:46.10]Alright, I think I'm going to go with the Matthew.
[80:48.26]Let's go.
[80:54.16]I got style level 1.
[80:58.83]Okay.
[81:00.73]Oh, shit.
[81:01.19]I get 5% more respect during activities?
[81:03.11]Okay, I need to do... I got to change this.
[81:16.98]To the same color.
[81:20.80]Is it like purple?
[81:23.42]Like a dark purple.
[81:24.04]It's like a purple pink.
[81:33.17]Where is it?
[81:33.61]Where's like the green?
[81:34.59]Is it yellow?
[81:35.09]Where's yellow?
[81:45.12]This is darker.
[81:54.14]There it is.
[81:55.34]Oh shit, I can just look at the color right there.
[82:03.68]Hmm.
[82:05.96]Solid?
[82:07.54]Oh, the hearts.
[82:08.42]I think solid.
[82:09.38]Because the question marks will clash.
[82:21.03]Okay.
[82:22.25]I need a better hat though.
[82:26.56]Human eyes?
[82:28.50]Oh.
[82:36.52]Do cat ears, please.
[82:37.90]Ski mask.
[82:38.74]Fine, I'll do the ski mask.
[82:43.16]What is it?
[82:44.34]Under, over shirts?
[82:44.98]Yeah, under shirts.
[82:47.28]Oh, it takes off the coat.
[82:48.88]I can't do the ski mask.
[82:58.27]It takes the coat off, right?
[83:04.66]I don't think it does.
[83:05.54]Okay.
[83:05.72]Well, I'll try it.
[83:06.28]Let's see.
[83:13.67]Okay.
[83:14.51]It's just... I'm just in agreement.
[83:17.11]I'm just grimace.
[83:36.81]I have to take this hat off, though.
[83:40.11]It's a spy.
[83:44.97]Gentlemen.
[83:48.17]This is one of those, like... You, like, combine two or three costumes.
[83:52.14]You're, like, the spy in another universe.
[83:55.88]I'm the spy, but I'm in the Batman universe.
[83:59.14]No, you... Okay.
[84:16.07]Okay, I think we're ready.
[84:17.63]We're ready to go take back the, uh, the territory.
[84:25.87]Now we just need to find the UFO we can skedaddle.
[84:29.39]Save.
[84:29.63]I got it.
[84:29.97]I got it.
[84:30.27]I got it.
[84:30.57]I got it.
[84:30.83]I got it.
[84:31.19]I got it.
[84:31.51]I got it.
[84:35.46]So I'm just going to sit here on this map because I'll walk around in a circle for the next 10 minutes.
[84:40.72]Where is the UFO on here?
[84:47.96]Where is it?
[84:50.82]Top right?
[84:52.59]Right here?
[84:56.09]It's a random spawn.
[84:58.93]Top left, middle, and right.
[85:01.33]Like up here.
[85:03.59]Up your ass.
[85:05.97]Fuck you.
[85:07.33]You know what?
[85:07.83]No.
[85:08.05]Let me freeze for a second.
[85:09.22]Fuck you.
[85:11.80]Fuck you.
[85:14.14]Fuck you.
[85:14.56]You know what I mean?
[85:15.14]Alright, it's right there?
[85:19.92]Let's try it.
[85:28.75]Oh shit, that's a nice car.
[85:29.79]Fuck you.
[85:30.33]You know what I mean?
[85:46.69]No, that's where I came in with the car.
[85:47.85]It's not up top, right?
[85:52.25]It's a random... I'm just going to get in the car and just drive around.
[85:54.85]And who cares?
[85:55.31]I thought Jerma was the nice guy.
[86:04.85]I am.
[86:05.23]I really am.
[86:07.43]I'm just having fun, right?
[86:08.56]It's all just a joke.
[86:11.70]Nothing I say is really you should ever take seriously.
[86:14.04]Fuck you.
[86:14.44]You know what I mean?
[86:22.03]I want people to know that this is a place for positivity.
[86:23.85]Fuck you.
[86:24.05]You know what I mean?
[86:25.07]And for us to come together and be good friends.
[86:28.05]Fuck you.
[86:28.31]You know what I mean?
[86:32.83]You're rough on your vehicles, you know that?
[86:36.88]Where is the UFO?
[86:49.00]I'm just... This car is insane.
[86:50.58]We're just taking this thing.
[86:51.34]Are you kidding me?
[86:54.07]We're just going to keep this.
[86:55.05]Why would I take something else?
[86:56.61]Let's get the hell out of here.
[87:05.13]UFO or riot.
[87:08.34]I don't know.
[87:08.70]It's a random spawn somewhere.
[87:17.28]Wait, what's it called?
[87:17.94]UFO?
[87:18.30]No.
[87:18.82]No.
[87:26.26]Oh, that was cool!
[87:26.96]Alright, I have to leave.
[87:36.57]I have to get out of this.
[87:43.73]You want to know something?
[87:44.39]Here's a little insight.
[87:46.05]I'm not kidding when I say this.
[87:47.31]This is for real.
[87:49.05]Listen to me.
[87:50.57]Even at a real mall.
[87:52.38]A real one.
[87:53.98]Even if I've been there 500 times.
[87:55.90]I don't know where I am.
[87:58.74]I don't know where I am because everything's the same.
[88:06.09]What the fuck is going on in here?
[88:10.90]It doesn't matter if I've been there 10 times, 50 times, 1,000 times.
[88:15.26]I don't know where the Auntie Anne's pretzel is, if you ask me.
[88:19.06]And it sucks so bad in these positions when, like, stuff, like, kind of is the same.
[88:24.08]When everything, like, looks the same.
[88:25.04]Everything, like, is the same.
[88:25.90]And... Jesus Christ.
[88:32.59]Because people will ask me...
[88:37.01]People ask me, hey, dude.
[88:38.67]Oh, yeah.
[88:40.69]You know this place.
[88:41.85]Where's the audience?
[88:43.23]And I have to pretend like I know where it is.
[88:44.79]Yes.
[88:57.79]Help me.
[88:58.25]It's like getting stuck in snow.
[88:59.41]Just pick up a few chairs and get rid of them.
[89:12.83]But yeah, like anything that is a bunch of stores or a bunch of stuff that looks very similar, my brain cannot put it into long-term memory because it's one gigantic place.
[89:24.54]It's not multiple places in one.
[89:26.70]It's not multiple places inside of one place.
[89:29.51]It's one place, and I can't differentiate it.
[89:43.88]Is that enough?
[89:51.83]You have to be... You actually have to be kidding.
[90:00.71]Can I shoot them?
[90:01.53]Maybe I can shoot them away.
[90:09.45]Jesus, dude.
[90:16.66]Okay, almost there.
[90:23.98]Got it.
[90:27.52]I almost just blew up and screamed, where's the exit?
[90:46.73]How do I get out of here?
[90:52.78]Help me, please.
[91:02.10]Is it right?
[91:06.46]I'm in tears.
[91:07.28]What?
[91:08.02]You're laughing this hard?
[91:09.28]How?
[91:10.20]What?
[91:12.73]Why are you laughing so hard?
[91:13.93]What do you mean you're in tears?
[91:22.04]Is it on the second level?
[91:27.75]I think it's up here.
[91:28.39]Because remember, I came in this way, I think.
[91:30.65]I think, right?
[91:36.99]Like this way?
[91:37.49]Over here?
[91:42.75]Is it the top floor?
[91:47.88]There goes the finish on this baby.
[91:53.47]Okay, then up this way?
[91:54.41]Alright, there it is.
[92:02.36]Is this it?
[92:04.46]Is this it?
[92:04.80]Get the fuck out of here.
[92:08.90]I'm never going in there ever again.
[92:13.86]It's the concrete.
[92:14.70]It's the different leveled concrete with everything the same in there.
[92:32.54]I'm not going to freak out.
[92:33.22]Those of you that saw the Hitman 3 playthrough.
[92:36.26]That's one of the maddest I've been in the entire year.
[92:38.46]I think.
[92:40.69]And I pretended I was high.
[92:42.31]So people wouldn't think I was an idiot.
[92:44.13]Alright, you ready?
[92:44.71]Let's go.
[92:45.41]Save the game.
[92:50.57]We're going.
[92:52.51]We're going.
[92:52.87]We're going.
[92:53.93]Whatever.
[92:54.37]Get in there.
[92:54.75]What's wrong with the... Tire.
[93:01.78]Tire.
[93:07.21]Not fucking around this time.
[93:09.11]I swear to God.
[93:09.85]Open up.
[93:15.71]Open up.
[93:36.24]Good.
[93:36.48]Go.
[93:36.70]20 FPS.
[93:37.16]Let's go!
[93:39.40]Get it!
[94:16.90]Oh no, you have like a hostage.
[94:27.98]What was that?
[94:29.10]Was that an explosion?
[94:37.16]I'm too much like a fat guy to turn and spray faster, so I just hold it down.
[94:44.11]Alright, we're gonna have to have a new plan here, I think.
[94:46.39]It's the grenade launcher.
[94:47.85]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[94:50.91]We need a new car.
[94:52.57]Can this break?
[95:00.67]We have to get a new car, like, right now.
[95:07.85]Are you out of the way?
[95:08.59]Get out of there!
[95:12.37]What's this guy's name?
[95:14.43]Sleepy... Sleepy Sean?
[95:15.97]I forget what his name was.
[95:16.83]Let's go!
[95:23.93]In!
[95:25.55]He's in.
[95:25.81]Good.
[95:31.31]Silencer Sean.
[95:32.53]Okay.
[95:34.83]I'm out of... We're losing control.
[95:35.85]We gotta get out.
[95:36.89]It's gonna explode in a minute.
[95:42.14]They're everywhere.
[95:42.74]This is unbelievable.
[95:49.78]Get in this one.
[95:53.80]Silencer, let's go!
[95:58.04]Come on, Silencer!
[96:01.41]Get in the car!
[96:14.72]Little big loss.
[96:22.19]Why would you have the top down in this car?
[96:23.65]I don't understand.
[96:24.39]Do you see how relentless they are?
[96:27.80]They're glued to you.
[96:32.30]He's not even looking.
[96:44.68]Oh, shit.
[96:45.38]Okay, hold on.
[96:51.74]They're up.
[96:52.86]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[96:54.70]Right here.
[96:54.98]I'm going to shoot a grenade.
[96:57.28]Who was shooting who there?
[96:58.70]That was confusing.
[97:00.52]I think that, did that person have a hostage?
[97:02.47]I have no idea.
[97:03.21]We got it.
[97:04.93]Thank God.
[97:07.31]How do you feel about Garfield precisely?
[97:09.99]Um, Garfield should have been a miniseries that lasted like a year.
[97:14.22]I think people would be happier.
[97:33.38]Oh, they don't even care anymore.
[97:34.18]Alright, we got our everything back.
[97:35.52]I need facecam.
[97:38.06]There's no facecam.
[97:39.30]Where do you guys see a facecam?
[97:43.36]What?
[97:50.17]Up, right?
[97:51.27]Yeah.
[97:54.95]Alright, now that's taken care of.
[97:55.87]I'm going to do the other, the next Ronin mission.
[98:09.95]Facecam over the guy's face.
[98:11.19]No.
[98:19.50]You can call an ambulance to heal.
[98:21.06]I need to make friends.
[98:22.46]I want to be able to call people to come help me in situations.
[98:41.23]It's fucking stupid.
[98:51.13]One second.
[98:52.47]I thought the guy in the passenger seat was driving and there was a blanket in the front seat.
[99:00.54]Well, that was custom upholstery for the seat.
[99:09.93]Like this is what I saw for a second.
[99:11.37]It was like a weird angle.
[99:27.06]Where's Johnny?
[99:27.96]Oh, I sent him out to the store.
[99:29.32]He should be back.
[99:31.10]Who the hell is that?
[99:32.78]Yo, that's our new house guest, baby.
[99:35.10]Caught this asshole riding around our turf.
[99:38.49]Got something you want to tell me?
[99:40.99]Go to hell.
[99:42.68]That wasn't very nice.
[99:45.72]That was so loud.
[99:46.70]My head hurts now.
[99:47.62]Why the fuck are you here?
[99:50.72]Whatever you do to me is nothing compared to what Mr. Okuji will do to you.
[99:56.36]The oil burn?
[99:57.62]No shit.
[99:58.78]When's it coming?
[100:00.30]I'll die before I tell you.
[100:02.40]Yep.
[100:05.19]You get, okay.
[100:09.35]You don't, you say you're gonna do it.
[100:10.85]You don't do it.
[100:11.39]You see if he tells you anything.
[100:12.89]You gotta give him at least two or three chances.
[100:14.67]Yeah.
[100:29.84]Or... Oh, here's an idea.
[100:35.44]Level with the guy.
[100:37.92]Put the gun down.
[100:38.46]Sit him down.
[100:41.80]Be like, look, here's where we're coming from.
[100:49.32]Order like... I don't know, order like a pizza.
[100:52.82]Talk about everything.
[100:53.52]Be like, look, we can level here.
[101:00.87]Than when they give you the info that you need.
[101:03.02]You might have heard a dude remember.
[101:07.72]Right?
[101:13.96]Oh, you got somebody on the inside.
[101:14.92]I was going to say, then you throw him out the window.
[101:26.79]But, no.
[101:27.27]I didn't want to say that.
[101:46.66]I have to destroy all these, right?
[101:53.76]I wasn't looking to chat.
[101:54.64]He's dead.
[101:55.18]Oh, no.
[101:57.20]What the fuck?
[101:59.34]How do I get back on the bike?
[102:00.53]You're about to abandon a follower?
[102:01.95]Where is he?
[102:02.41]I don't even know where he is.
[102:09.59]What?
[102:16.12]Where is he?
[102:17.19]Come here.
[102:25.83]I have no idea where he is.
[102:28.13]Abandoned, apparently.
[102:29.01]Hold up to dismiss party.
[102:35.76]Oh, okay.
[102:36.06]There we go.
[102:36.32]Let's go.
[102:48.02]Don't shoot.
[102:48.42]Jesus Christ.
[102:54.57]Get on the right side of the road, you idiot.
[103:03.55]New friend?
[103:11.22]Uh... The, um...
[103:29.87]Whatever let's go.
[103:33.01]Oh wait.
[103:33.39]We got we got slimy Shawn back What was the point of that entire u-turn?
[103:50.32]These missions are kind of hard.
[103:52.14]Here we go.
[103:53.98]Alright.
[103:54.28]Four to four.
[104:04.02]No.
[104:06.98]Here it is.
[104:07.60]Here's four.
[104:08.00]Don't do that so close to me.
[104:21.25]Why is this not disabled?
[104:22.47]Uh-huh.
[104:24.57]What?
[104:25.09]What are you talking about?
[104:27.03]That was four.
[104:27.66]Fucking god damn it.
[104:29.78]How is he dead?
[104:36.34]It was the wrong bike?
[104:44.84]How am I gonna pull it out of the concrete?
[105:00.79]Get on.
[105:08.24]I swear that came out of nowhere.
[105:19.54]Okay.
[105:23.42]If I get close enough, he should be able to shoot them, right?
[105:25.72]Theoretically.
[105:26.24]I didn't hit anything?
[105:33.91]That guy was flying.
[105:40.99]I guess I... Oh my god, fuck you.
[105:44.27]Fuck you, goddammit.
[105:52.39]Alright, there's only one more.
[105:53.81]Come on.
[106:00.87]Don't.
[106:01.33]Please.
[106:01.95]Do not.
[106:02.66]Why?
[106:09.38]Dread air.
[106:18.81]How am I going to catch up?
[106:26.30]Oh, I did it.
[106:27.56]Okay, we're good.
[106:31.90]Dane, don't worry.
[106:33.10]I'll get the money back.
[106:34.40]You're missing the point, Shogo.
[106:35.74]The money was insured.
[106:37.36]I'm more concerned about you.
[106:39.34]What?
[106:40.32]Ultor and the Ronin have had a very healthy relationship in the past, but lately, well, when I pay protection money, I expect some fucking protection.
[106:49.65]Watch yourself, Vogel.
[106:51.69]The Saints are a concern, Shogo.
[106:53.81]Not for long.
[106:55.25]Why's that?
[106:56.00]I've got my best man working on that now.
[106:58.87]Do some of the other missions.
[107:01.07]We've been doing most of the Ronin stuff.
[107:02.91]Maybe we'll start somewhere else.
[107:11.16]Ronins have the best missions though.
[107:13.80]What is it, Shogo?
[107:15.00]I'm in a meeting with Dane Vogel.
[107:16.90]He wants assurances that the- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[107:20.03]Like always.
[107:36.86]I want to buy a car that's mine that I keep in a garage.
[107:41.23]I don't just want to steal cars for the entire game.
[107:44.59]Okay, this is the loft.
[107:51.72]It's for sale.
[107:52.38]How about another running mission?
[108:00.24]Why not?
[108:11.84]You can literally steal any car for free in store.
[108:13.84]Yeah, but aren't there some cars you can only buy?
[108:15.38]Aren't there some kind of... Because this is Gentleman of the Row.
[108:21.48]So, isn't there some things that I can only get from Gentleman of the Row?
[108:35.60]Is this better than Saints Row 3?
[108:37.61]Um, I don't know.
[108:38.35]People feel the same way about Saints Row that people feel about Dark Souls.
[108:43.54]Very contested.
[108:44.68]Very heated.
[108:48.07]Saints Row 2 is the best.
[108:49.35]No, that's an idiotic opinion.
[108:50.97]Saints Row 4 is the best.
[108:52.01]Are you serious?
[108:55.06]That's the worst one.
[109:04.76]From my understanding, from what I've been told, because I've never played these, Saints Row 2 is the combination of the seriousness of Saints Row 1, potentially, with a little bit of the more cartoony, weird, wacky shit that they did in the later games.
[109:22.00]I've heard that's the middle ground here, is Saints Row 2.
[109:36.90]Sorry, I was reading chat.
[109:45.87]This is the middle ground.
[109:48.59]If you don't know the Saints Row franchise, eventually you can run up buildings and fly and stuff.
[109:54.23]You actually have superpowers.
[109:55.54]It's a superhero game.
[109:59.11]They're kind of rebooting the whole franchise, right?
[110:01.12]And didn't they say that we can't... We have to reel it back to reality because they went too far in the fourth one?
[110:11.73]I have no idea how that one's going to turn out.
[110:13.15]That was stupid.
[110:22.13]What does Dark Souls have to do with this?
[110:24.37]Well, that's easy.
[110:25.01]There's like four games in the Dark Souls quote series.
[110:28.55]You count Demon's Souls.
[110:31.37]And everybody thinks that Dark Souls 1 is the best.
[110:34.93]But then you have people that think Dark Souls 3 is better than Dark Souls 1.
[110:37.59]Then you have people that say that Demon's Souls is better than all of them.
[110:49.77]And you've got the weirdos that think that Dark Souls 2 is the best one, right?
[110:53.49]I don't take much pleasure in this.
[111:15.20]Then let me go.
[111:17.44]That depends on you.
[111:19.14]Dark Souls 2 is the best one.
[111:20.93]Aisha doesn't care that I'm stopping by, does she?
[111:23.13]Fuck no.
[111:24.17]Aisha doesn't go out much.
[111:25.11]I can't take anything going on seriously.
[111:27.45]Should I drag the sliders back a little?
[111:31.06]You're gonna kill me, aren't you?
[111:33.18]If you're calm, help us find the money and do what I say.
[111:37.60]I give you my word you will live.
[111:43.47]You should go to a plastic surgeon.
[111:44.99]Aisha, you home?
[111:53.68]Who laid it on their neck?
[111:55.80]That person just put themselves in the hospital.
[112:09.83]Oh shit.
[112:32.81]This is really making me understand that, like, nobody kind of- nobody looks cool in a superhero costume doing stuff.
[113:04.96]You can't hear me, I know.
[113:09.02]Oh shit, no.
[113:18.61]Of course it doesn't work, you didn't pull the trigger.
[113:44.01]Oh, alright.
[113:45.47]Good thing Slippery Slick is here with me.
[113:49.63]Protect Gat?
[113:51.81]Oh, he's back there.
[113:57.17]We have to get off the bike.
[113:59.03]Get off the bike.
[113:59.86]You got to go.
[114:00.78]You got to go.
[114:01.24]You got to go.
[114:01.64]You got to go.
[114:02.02]You got to go.
[114:02.52]Where are you?
[114:03.76]Where are they?
[114:05.02]Where are they?
[114:12.02]You have to pick them up?
[114:16.72]What do we do?
[114:17.66]Is he alright?
[114:19.66]What's happening?
[114:20.20]Why is there a countdown?
[114:21.70]Why is there a countdown?
[114:23.84]Is he gonna explode?
[114:29.26]What's taking that ambulance so long?
[114:31.64]What?
[114:37.40]Flashbang!
[114:37.80]Go now!
[114:38.32]Is somebody calling me?
[114:41.02]Johnny's heard.
[114:41.84]I need a pick up now.
[114:44.02]Hang tight!
[114:44.70]I'm coming!
[114:51.83]Kidding me Did it what the fuck Watch where you're shooting you're gonna shoot him in the head Easy with where you're aiming the gun.
[115:11.72]What the fuck was that?
[115:12.92]Oh, I have a bazooka I
[115:19.75]They just give you these weapons.
[115:21.27]I didn't know I had this.
[115:26.29]That's not even enemies.
[115:28.49]He's gonna hit him in the head.
[115:37.30]Just focus on driving the car, you fucking idiot.
[115:42.12]This is so stupid.
[115:48.04]I can't even aim this.
[115:48.85]He's... What's happening?
[115:50.01]Who's in front of us?
[115:53.49]Are we on fire?
[115:59.49]I can't shoot anybody with this because it's too close.
[116:02.00]We're gonna die.
[116:02.86]I... We're supposed to be going to the hospital.
[116:14.46]I think he's driven in a circle.
[116:19.03]I can't fire it this close.
[116:23.41]What?
[116:23.93]Stop jerking the car around.
[116:26.00]For the love of God, just drive normally.
[116:27.98]Are we driving on somebody's house?
[116:43.50]Holy shit!
[116:49.04]That was unbelievable.
[116:54.72]Crazy taxi!
[116:56.22]Here we go!
[117:00.77]Uh, sorry, that was 1080 snowboarding.
[117:07.49]I mixed them up together.
[117:23.33]Do we get out?
[117:23.89]Oh my god, he's running people over.
[117:27.03]Play the America's Funniest Home Videos theme song right now.
[117:37.60]No.
[117:41.74]Where's he going?
[117:42.28]I don't know.
[117:42.62]I'm not driving.
[117:50.37]I think he's driving to the hospital.
[117:51.75]I think.
[117:59.94]This guy is absolutely... He's gonna stick around.
[118:05.48]What's this guy's name?
[118:05.98]Slobber and Sam?
[118:08.80]No, no, no.
[118:09.48]That's a 90's kids board game.
[118:12.92]Whatever his name is.
[118:13.50]Who cares?
[118:14.03]Doesn't matter.
[118:20.08]Oh, that was a stupid idea, but we're okay.
[118:24.86]John Silencer?
[118:25.79]That's right.
[118:34.01]I look so happy.
[118:34.81]I have a big smile.
[118:48.46]Where's the hospital?
[118:58.19]Can I switch weapons?
[118:59.96]I can't switch weapons.
[119:08.79]This guy's lost?
[119:12.23]It kind of feels that way.
[119:13.15]I don't have to do anything, do I?
[119:28.00]Check the map.
[119:31.24]There's a hospital right here.
[119:36.56]Oh, there it is.
[119:45.84]Okay, we made it.
[119:47.80]Did we get out?
[119:50.10]Alright, we're good.
[119:54.95]Taking him to plastic surgery.
[119:57.49]Johnny, you're going to be fine.
[120:00.23]Gotta save Ish.
[120:07.04]He just comes out with like a cheek implant or something.
[120:10.72]He's dead.
[120:11.98]Don't get too excited, asshole.
[120:14.22]Gad will be back up in no time.
[120:15.86]Yo, that came out wrong.
[120:16.90]Just shut up and listen.
[120:18.52]Gad was looking into a Japanese crime boss called Akuji.
[120:21.53]This guy's coming to town soon and I want to know when.
[120:25.12]Don't fuck this up, Piers.
[120:26.58]I'm not in a good mood.
[120:30.02]Must be so sweaty and hot under that mask.
[120:41.02]500 cash per day.
[120:41.82]Now I get 6,000.
[120:45.77]Should I do an activity?
[120:51.53]Maybe I should.
[120:51.93]What's this one?
[121:03.49]Please go to the plastic surgeon.
[121:04.91]Should I?
[121:21.59]Yes, finally.
[121:22.65]Finally, finally, finally.
[121:23.99]Yes, finally, finally, finally.
[121:25.47]What do you mean, finally?
[121:26.53]Okay.
[121:28.13]Okay.
[121:33.72]Image design allows you to change your appearance, customize your movement, combat style, taunts, and compliments.
[121:37.62]Oh, okay.
[121:38.56]It also removes your notoriety.
[121:39.84]Well, I don't want to change.
[121:42.72]I don't want to change my... I don't want to change the premise.
[121:57.34]I wanted to do this, though.
[121:58.06]Whatever it was.
[121:58.48]Maybe one here.
[122:04.11]The grill?
[122:05.03]The griddler?
[122:07.65]Like a McGriddle?
[122:12.07]The McGriddler?
[122:20.52]Thank God I just saved it because the game crashed.
[122:30.10]I like the McGriddler.
[122:32.64]That's a good one.
[122:41.53]At least put the sliders back a little bit.
[122:43.61]I don't think we... I can't do that.
[122:48.49]Crashed again.
[122:49.05]Shit.
[122:49.21]That's not good.
[123:01.81]Too powerful?
[123:03.27]Take a pee break.
[123:04.39]Maybe in a minute.
[123:06.29]I'm locked in.
[123:12.23]This game's boring.
[123:12.81]You should play Fortnite.
[123:19.15]Yeah, see?
[123:19.55]Right here.
[123:28.78]Alright, can I... Isn't there something I can do?
[123:34.26]Right?
[123:35.52]This is... Why is it so bright in here?
[123:37.30]Holy goodness!
[123:39.30]What the hell?
[123:40.04]It's so bright!
[123:47.87]Is there illuminated paint in here?
[123:55.49]What?
[123:56.95]Whoa.
[123:59.27]It was 10 grand in that.
[124:00.51]Oh, that's awesome.
[124:02.89]Alright.
[124:03.19]Nice.
[124:03.41]I got money now.
[124:07.55]I'm going to go buy something.
[124:12.32]I finally went into a house and took the money.
[124:14.76]Yeah.
[124:20.50]Is there anything in the garage?
[124:21.22]Probably not.
[124:21.68]No.
[124:24.87]Nothing.
[124:27.31]Gamble it all the way?
[124:28.05]No.
[124:32.67]Oh.
[124:34.51]What's this here?
[124:35.23]Oh, wait.
[124:35.59]There's the hitman activities.
[124:38.17]Let me see what they were.
[124:38.85]Trailer park hitman.
[124:42.76]Okay.
[124:44.48]Get a security guard for the trailer park.
[124:47.02]Start a fight in the area and someone is bound to call them over to settle the argument.
[124:50.55]Okay, go to the trailer park district and fight the security guard.
[125:00.33]The trailer park district is where?
[125:04.44]Insurance fraud activities are really fun.
[125:06.46]It's the crutches icon.
[125:07.54]Okay.
[125:14.81]Have I found one?
[125:21.03]Is it the left side?
[125:21.83]Okay.
[125:25.73]Check the south.
[125:30.25]Oh.
[125:32.67]Oh.
[125:33.09]Okay.
[125:37.78]Oh.
[125:43.54]Change filters on the map.
[125:49.68]Here's Mayhem.
[125:51.58]I don't think I've even seen a Crushes.
[125:52.68]Should we go here?
[125:56.36]I haven't found any, no.
[126:02.07]Let's go see what this is.
[126:09.95]McRiddler.
[126:13.52]McRiddler absolutely is confirmed for the end of the year rumble, by the way.
[126:18.90]I have 100 in all stats.
[126:22.24]Oh, by the way, let's talk about that real quick.
[126:25.33]This weekend, probably before Sunday's stream, the New Year's Eve categories are going to be up.
[126:34.62]Probably this Sunday.
[126:37.36]And you're going to be able to do them.
[126:38.34]We're going to go through the nominating process again.
[126:41.22]And then a week or two later, voting will open.
[126:45.96]And then obviously two or three weeks later, we'll do the award show.
[126:53.46]So look for the nominees to open up this weekend.
[126:57.75]A lot of people are probably new to the channel in the last year.
[127:01.51]Every year we do an event on New Year's Eve.
[127:07.01]That is the worst of the year.
[127:09.87]And some best of the year as well.
[127:12.35]Talking worst stream of the year.
[127:13.63]Worst noise I've made the whole year.
[127:15.79]The worst face I've made the whole year.
[127:18.75]It's an annual tradition.
[127:19.78]We're going to keep it up again this year.
[127:21.44]If you'd like to participate.
[127:23.66]If you remember an exact moment in time where you were like, that face was awful.
[127:29.04]And I was disgusting.
[127:29.84]He looked terrible.
[127:30.70]His hair looked awful.
[127:31.60]Worst hair.
[127:34.48]Give us the timestamp.
[127:35.22]Give us the clip.
[127:37.31]We'll go from there.
[127:39.49]Annual cyberbullying of the streamer.
[127:52.76]The worst hair ever was last year.
[127:54.64]I know.
[127:55.10]I don't think you'll ever find one this course.
[127:57.24]What is this?
[128:00.02]That's a new icon.
[128:02.81]Fight club.
[128:12.47]Are you gonna stream the game awards on the 9th?
[128:14.99]Yeah, I would say so.
[128:16.15]Okay.
[128:41.16]Compete in brutal fighting matches for cash and respect.
[128:43.98]Pick up and eat food to recover health.
[128:47.29]Kill all the fighters and survive.
[128:49.27]I got a good tactic.
[128:54.91]It's called run and let them fight each other first.
[128:57.90]Oh wait, it's 2v1.
[128:58.40]Never mind.
[129:14.46]Wait, you can kick people in the balls.
[129:16.30]That's not illegal.
[129:23.19]I feel like it would be really... Oh, shit.
[129:25.17]You should have come on too, big bitch.
[129:38.19]They just dropped that on his head.
[129:40.27]Finish opponents after a knockdown to take them out of the fight.
[129:47.17]I don't know what 1 is.
[129:47.79]It's A. Where'd you go?
[129:55.88]That guy didn't have a chance.
[130:03.70]I feel like I'm going to be really good at this.
[130:14.18]100 bucks?
[130:17.92]That's a lot of respect.
[130:21.00]Let's keep going.
[130:28.37]Okay, level 2.
[130:31.05]Do I get style points for taunting?
[130:43.53]Come on, give me the trash.
[130:44.43]Put that down, get out of here.
[131:04.82]Shit, he has it.
[131:06.22]That thing's too hard to swing.
[131:11.50]Wait, what's two?
[131:12.44]Oh no, that's bad.
[131:18.76]A or is it B?
[131:19.78]Okay, it's X. Two is X. Dude, I... Do they keep changing?
[131:36.29]I don't know what these are.
[131:37.45]With the command prompts.
[131:39.40]I'm just gonna have to pick up the fucking mouse and do it.
[131:53.27]What is it?
[131:56.45]Game, I just fucking... If I press... I just right-clicked and the fucking window minimized.
[132:09.85]What is right-click on the controller?
[132:15.77]Right-click.
[132:16.47]It would be left trigger?
[132:17.57]Yep.
[132:25.89]Blunt?
[132:33.09]That hurt me.
[132:34.11]That didn't even do anything good for me.
[132:41.23]Oh, very cool.
[132:56.40]Nice.
[132:58.04]This is a really good way to farm respect.
[133:05.89]3v1.
[133:06.21]Alright, this is going to get hard.
[133:08.03]Especially because of not knowing what the buttons are.
[133:19.52]Yeah.
[133:36.86]Oh, rock bottom!
[133:38.18]Rock bottom!
[133:40.56]Why did I stand up and fall?
[133:45.29]This is an unfair weight class?
[133:49.27]Left click is right trigger, right?
[133:53.67]Yeah, it's just confusing.
[134:04.94]What is it that's no God it's left.
[134:07.66]What is that left trigger?
[134:14.62]Left click is right trigger because that's shoot.
[134:18.24]That's my okay.
[134:19.52]I'm pissed oh
[134:27.71]Left trigger is aim.
[134:29.22]It is?
[134:29.52]So it'll be right... Left... So it'll be right trigger?
[134:34.88]Okay.
[134:41.52]You really...
[134:56.81]There we go.
[134:57.07]Alright.
[134:58.93]We're good.
[135:06.64]I got a little weird.
[135:09.94]Left is right.
[135:10.70]Yeah, it's confusing me.
[135:23.10]Yeah, the button prompts are supposed to be in the mod.
[135:25.34]I looked back at the mod files.
[135:28.56]It's supposed to be there.
[135:33.22]You've unlocked the nut punch.
[135:34.50]Okay.
[135:37.15]There's an option in the installer.
[135:43.27]Yeah.
[135:44.15]You didn't pick that option.
[135:45.05]The installer, I was kind of scared of.
[135:48.05]Because it was like, just build the default mod the way that the mod is meant to be played.
[135:53.09]Or you could go through and pick stuff and it would add it, but it wouldn't.
[135:55.53]I don't know.
[135:55.81]It was confusing.
[135:58.37]As you play Saints Row 2, you unlock rewards.
[136:00.73]To see them, press the pause menu.
[136:02.99]This is going to be impossible.
[136:04.35]Maybe they actually are fighting each other.
[136:15.08]They are.
[136:15.32]Alright, just run away.
[136:20.26]Come on, Gridler.
[136:21.02]You need to save.
[136:24.73]Alright, that guy, that's the guy to beat right there.
[136:26.19]The Hurricanrana guy.
[136:26.91]It's the Abyss Watchers.
[136:35.09]It is.
[136:55.53]I just hit myself in the face with the trash can.
[136:57.07]Are you kidding me?
[137:01.99]I need a hamburger on the ground.
[137:11.33]What is it?
[137:12.27]Two.
[137:16.92]Give me it.
[137:17.46]Drink it.
[137:24.70]That feels like cheating.
[137:25.47]I feel like I'm drinking Estus.
[137:37.64]Fight!
[137:38.50]Fight each other, don't just fight me.
[137:39.72]This guy's close.
[138:10.52]Alright, this guy's done.
[138:15.76]That was the really scary guy.
[138:16.78]He was doing like roundhouse kicks and shit.
[138:25.13]How many levels are there?
[138:26.15]10?
[138:31.45]You can switch your fighting style at the surgeon.
[138:33.67]Mmm.
[138:37.72]If you drank the Estus Flask at any point in Dark Souls, you're not a real gamer.
[138:41.02]That's fine.
[138:53.39]Five people.
[139:06.06]I'm not going to be able to string any combos together on anybody.
[139:09.04]I don't think at least.
[139:22.13]I'm just spamming.
[139:22.87]I don't even know who I'm hitting.
[139:28.85]Dark Souls ResidentSleeper.
[139:29.93]Really?
[139:31.85]People love that game.
[139:32.55]What do you mean?
[139:44.77]There's one guy that doesn't like Dark Souls.
[139:51.20]You know, there's one guy for everything.
[139:59.82]Always remember that you are the one guy for something.
[140:04.10]Always.
[140:06.37]No matter what.
[140:06.81]I'm trying to think of what I'm the one guy for.
[140:18.89]There's probably a few things.
[140:22.90]What am I the one guy of?
[140:26.44]What opinion do I have?
[140:27.28]What thing would I say?
[140:38.72]You're the sus guy.
[140:41.50]Well, I'm not, though.
[140:48.36]How did they boot that?
[141:01.08]Damn it.
[141:03.53]This is really easy to do, though.
[141:05.33]I'm farming respect.
[141:20.71]Get him!
[141:24.07]Get him!
[141:27.61]Wait, hold on.
[141:27.97]I was trying to hit an audience member.
[141:42.46]You streaming the game awards?
[141:43.44]Yes.
[141:45.88]In my special outfit.
[141:52.07]11,000 respect.
[141:54.01]Nice.
[141:54.27]There's more.
[142:00.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[142:02.81]Are we really going to put 10 people in here?
[142:06.12]No way.
[142:20.01]I have $20,000.
[142:21.03]This is awesome.
[142:23.69]Alright, focus.
[142:32.28]The second somebody kicks somebody in the balls, everything's stopping.
[142:35.56]And this person's gonna get thrown out.
[142:37.92]I'm gonna get fucking beat up on the way out of this place.
[142:41.73]I'm gonna get my fucking face kicked in all the way outside of the restaurant.
[142:59.67]Save the game.
[143:04.95]Rev it like the arena.
[143:06.37]I don't know why I said restaurant.
[143:08.07]It's true.
[143:13.02]Kick him.
[143:13.56]Let me up.
[143:14.66]Get away from me.
[143:17.62]God damn it.
[143:19.16]See, I kicked somebody in the balls and now everybody wants to kill me.
[143:26.26]I'm going to lose.
[143:31.19]Oh wait, he's got me.
[143:32.19]He's gonna break my neck.
[143:34.93]I didn't know they could do it to you too.
[143:36.31]It's gonna be a vulture.
[143:48.89]What the?
[143:53.37]It changes.
[143:59.55]No, I wanted that.
[144:00.59]Give me that.
[144:08.30]Shit.
[144:12.02]Omega low five-year-old.
[144:15.87]What do you mean five-year-old?
[144:20.77]I'm okay.
[144:22.45]Everything's fine.
[144:35.14]I know I'm just doing this over and over again, but I'm getting so much money and so much respect.
[144:39.92]It's really, really helpful.
[144:41.09]The game's going to crash?
[144:53.21]I hope not.
[144:58.53]Can I save it right now?
[145:04.74]What?
[145:08.27]Progress during this activity will not save.
[145:10.49]That's annoying.
[145:17.03]Police?
[145:17.49]Okay, there we go.
[145:33.88]Saves what level you got up to.
[145:35.02]Oh, alright.
[145:44.71]Holy shit.
[145:45.99]Five grand?
[145:48.93]Okay.
[145:50.89]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[145:53.39]Your melee attacks now do a lot more damage.
[146:01.04]So, okay, somebody correct me here.
[146:03.08]If I exit this, save it, and then go back, can I play at level 6?
[146:07.96]Or do I have to start at level 1?
[146:09.85]Well, that was it.
[146:11.39]That actually was the whole thing.
[146:17.99]Oh, okay.
[146:19.89]Nice.
[146:22.74]I got a ton of respect for that.
[146:26.04]I'm at x7 respect.
[146:31.79]Cool.
[146:31.99]Alright, let's go.
[146:32.71]Where... Should I do the... Hmm.
[146:37.73]What else is down here?
[146:38.45]Oh, do insurance fraud.
[146:44.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[146:47.02]Over here?
[146:47.38]Do insurance.
[146:51.34]I'm going, I'm going.
[147:03.21]This is so much fun.
[147:04.13]Can I just tell you guys that?
[147:09.69]Can we just talk?
[147:10.25]I didn't get very much sleep last night.
[147:17.02]I'm so fucking excited.
[147:18.78]I can't wait.
[147:20.72]It's gonna be so much fun.
[147:22.12]This is so much fun shit to do.
[147:30.84]I just want to scream it at you.
[147:32.04]You know what I mean?
[147:32.88]I want to scream it so loud.
[147:34.74]I want to yell at you.
[147:40.24]It's all I can think about.
[147:41.30]I can't think of anything else.
[147:45.90]Is that it?
[147:46.26]Demolition Derby.
[147:49.29]That sounds like fun.
[147:49.85]I'm doing it.
[148:05.92]What are you talking about?
[148:09.12]I'm talking about 2022.
[148:11.30]It is going to be a lot of fun.
[148:16.56]Where is this?
[148:27.09]The streamer is vague.
[148:28.45]Yeah, I know.
[148:35.87]Congrats on the kid.
[148:37.03]You know, there was one point where I wanted to hire like a five-year-old actor to come in the room and be like, like, dad, like, can you, I'm scared.
[148:44.37]Can you read me a story?
[148:59.22]And I was gonna be like, it's okay, son.
[149:00.78]I'll be in there in a minute.
[149:02.30]I was gonna have, like, a five-year-old actor, like, be on stream and pretend to be, like, my son.
[149:06.83]People would be like, what the?
[149:10.95]You have, like, a six-year-old?
[149:13.21]What?
[149:13.49]And I'd be like, yeah, I just got, I've kept it private, you know.
[149:27.81]Okay, select your car for the demo.
[149:28.89]Oh, I can select my car.
[149:29.61]It was gonna be an actor!
[149:35.83]It was gonna be an actor!
[149:36.90]That would've been fucked up.
[149:49.06]Okay, car.
[149:57.03]I want this.
[149:58.65]Level one.
[149:59.75]Level two.
[150:00.69]Oh, wait, I only have one point?
[150:02.07]What do you mean one point?
[150:05.06]We get a fully grown adult actor?
[150:10.70]You don't think that would have been weird?
[150:13.27]You don't think that was... It's weird.
[150:17.02]If a full grown adult walked in here and was like asking me to like read, um, are you serious?
[150:24.43]My version was weird, but that one's the, the, the funny one.
[150:27.25]I think I'm going to defense.
[150:39.66]Eight car demolition derby and destroy your opponent's cars.
[150:43.66]Let's do it.
[150:45.42]An elderly actor.
[151:00.67]Just let them fight each other.
[151:02.87]Oh, no.
[151:07.63]Hire an entire family.
[151:08.69]I already did that.
[151:12.35]I already did that stream.
[151:14.95]You may not have been here when I did, but I did that already.
[151:22.30]Those of you that want some lore, go type in TheFamilyDinnerJerma985 into like YouTube or Google.
[151:28.86]I already did that.
[151:32.28]And people hated it.
[151:34.66]People fucking hated that stream.
[151:36.78]They were like, it was so awkward and scary.
[151:38.50]I hated every second of it.
[151:41.40]The editor of that video said that's my least favorite thing that I've ever done for the channel.
[151:50.30]I was like, I'm sorry.
[151:53.22]Oh my god, dude.
[152:11.41]What the fuck?
[152:11.99]What are they all doing?
[152:12.72]They're all going after me.
[152:13.62]I'm going to explode.
[152:15.86]Do you have a money goal I have to hit?
[152:24.36]Yeah, but these guys all have additions to their car.
[152:28.73]This car sucks.
[152:33.45]This one sucks.
[152:42.59]Why are my ears ringing?
[152:45.83]Get me out of here.
[152:46.35]Why are my ears ringing?
[152:47.89]Alright, so is it this one?
[152:57.20]Okay.
[153:15.75]Come on, what is it?
[153:18.27]Is this, what is this heart?
[153:21.35]What is this?
[153:22.97]Oh, um... Uh... I think we're gonna walk by this one for now.
[153:36.99]Where's the insurance fraud?
[153:42.91]Alright, if it's not this one, then I'm just gonna do the brown emission.
[153:46.48]It's not TOS?
[153:50.26]Yeah, I... Escort activity, to me, feels like something I would need to be careful of on stream.
[153:57.25]It's $1,500?
[153:57.37]What?
[154:00.29]Oh, okay, there's somebody in the car.
[154:23.11]Don't crash.
[154:23.89]I'm trying not to.
[154:38.62]It sounds like the Macho Man Randy Savage videos where he's breathing and just it's only the breaths that are edited.
[154:44.70]It's just like... No!
[155:04.35]Jesus!
[155:05.11]God!
[155:06.11]No!
[155:06.87]12 seconds, please!
[155:09.65]12 seconds, please!
[155:15.43]It's enough to take me to the boiling point!
[155:17.84]$1500, I'll take it.
[155:26.50]Give me my money.
[155:32.03]Okay.
[155:37.35]What was I doing?
[155:41.05]Yes.
[155:41.27]It's like a Jeep.
[155:58.28]Hold on.
[155:58.84]Stop.
[156:03.00]That's my favorite shitty rift.
[156:10.77]Anybody else have a favorite shitty default rift?
[156:40.36]Shake it.
[156:41.48]Riff, riff.
[156:42.48]Yeah, whatever.
[156:43.06]You know what I meant.
[156:54.14]Okay.
[156:55.04]Right there.
[156:55.64]Let's go.
[156:56.00]There's nobody driving that.
[156:59.83]Oh.
[157:01.45]I was about to let go.
[157:04.67]There's nobody driving that.
[157:05.75]No, it's not that one.
[157:34.48]Okay, I'm so fucking done with this The sex palace I don't want to go in there
[158:01.72]Alright, you guys keep talking about this insurance fraud mission.
[158:06.12]But I... It's not on the map.
[158:08.61]Is it just... Is it rare?
[158:10.27]How rare is this?
[158:10.97]It's above the burger?
[158:27.80]I could have pissed so bad.
[158:33.75]Alright, what's down here?
[158:35.97]I swear to fucking god, arrest me.
[158:37.45]Just take me to jail.
[158:38.61]Arrest me right now.
[158:39.53]I'll go to jail willingly.
[158:41.93]Please.
[158:49.55]I just almost pissed.
[158:50.13]I peed.
[158:51.41]I actually, like, a little drop of piss came out.
[158:53.17]That scared the shit out of me.
[158:54.75]There was no reason why I was gonna get struck by lightning underground or anything.
[158:57.75]I almost peed.
[158:58.59]And I think I may have.
[159:14.09]Okay.
[159:16.41]It's not there.
[159:17.18]Top left island.
[159:20.88]How do I get here?
[159:24.60]Is this the prison?
[159:25.76]Luckily a power plant.
[159:37.43]Top right museum district.
[159:38.95]Okay.
[159:43.63]Right here.
[159:45.30]This is really far away from where I am right now.
[159:58.43]I'm gonna take a pee break after this.
[159:59.51]I'm not gonna do the mission.
[160:01.57]I'm just gonna get up there.
[160:03.99]Yeah, why is it so bright?
[160:23.89]I want a motorcycle that'll be faster.
[160:25.31]Never mind.
[160:28.11]Because my GPU is fucked up.
[160:31.39]You should bottle and sell your urine.
[160:59.10]You guys are actually fucking crazy.
[161:08.05]It's just a constant stream of just nonsense.
[161:12.27]What have I done to you?
[161:16.39]Ah, here it is.
[161:20.94]Once a week or something, I'm going to start doing math problems on stream.
[161:24.58]We're going to talk about logic problems.
[161:26.38]We're going to talk about life skills.
[161:29.28]All I see over here now is, like, serial killer pee.
[161:31.55]Drink his pee.
[161:32.17]I'm gonna drink his piss.
[161:33.19]I'm gonna put his piss in my mouth.
[161:34.51]Like, I gotta, like, teach you guys stuff.
[161:45.74]It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
[161:47.72]So what's this business proposal you mentioned?
[161:49.58]He pooped his diaper.
[161:50.44]Diaper poopoo.
[161:51.42]I got to teach you guys some things.
[161:53.04]I don't care what anyone says.
[161:55.50]I may be a badass, but I don't think I can change the way an entire profession thinks about gender.
[162:00.04]If I get in the brilliant book of world records for most patients served, I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient, if not more so, than their male counterparts.
[162:09.65]Alright.
[162:11.14]Weren't you literally a teacher?
[162:12.28]No, I literally handed out worksheets and didn't know anything going on in the class.
[162:16.68]It actually terrified me when a student had a question.
[162:19.65]Just checking.
[162:30.39]It was so sad and it was so wholesome.
[162:33.37]They'd come up, they'd be like, oh, I need help with this one.
[162:36.23]And I'd just be, I'd be like, okay, yeah, I don't, I don't know anything.
[162:42.43]But you need help and I want someone to be able to teach you and help you.
[162:46.13]And I think I would say, you know, how about you try your best and try, do what you can.
[162:54.22]And when the teacher's back, you'll be able to go back and forth with the teacher.
[163:02.81]But how do I do it?
[163:04.51]Well, I mean, I know, but I want to make sure that you know, so you're prepared.
[163:09.97]I'm just here to make sure that you can figure it out on your own.
[163:18.44]I didn't listen to a single thing in that cutscene, so I'm just going to go pee.
[163:25.94]But anytime I'd hear the sound, because I'd be looking down, just going to look at the desk and shifting papers around, pretending I was an important adult.
[163:33.62]You'd hear the of a chair moving back.
[163:38.50]I'd be sitting there going, no, no, no, no, please don't come up here.
[163:41.36]Please don't come up here and tell me how to do algebra or like how to do like long division.
[163:44.70]Please, God.
[163:47.98]And then you'd hear a couple steps to the desk.
[163:52.45]They're coming up here and they're going to ask a question.
[163:54.61]Please don't.
[163:55.51]Please, please ask anything else.
[163:58.55]Uh, can I go to the bathroom?
[163:59.91]Yep.
[164:00.81]Oh, absolutely.
[164:01.49]I'll give you a hall pass for that.
[164:03.19]Come over here.
[164:03.87]Have a seat.
[164:04.85]Oh, yeah.
[164:05.11]Let me give it a big signature on it.
[164:07.17]Oh, Mr. Elbertson.
[164:08.53]Here it is.
[164:09.03]Take that.
[164:09.85]I am a teacher.
[164:10.69]Go ahead.
[164:12.05]And you, by the way, you got five, ten, fifteen minutes.
[164:15.07]Whatever it takes.
[164:15.99]Go do what you need to do.
[164:17.29]I can sign that.
[164:17.85]I'm an adult.
[164:22.06]And I felt great.
[164:22.74]I was like, thank God it wasn't a question.
[164:33.29]You should just teach in a preschool.
[164:36.21]No, I shouldn't teach at all.
[164:39.29]It was like a thing that I did because I was just trying to do something that I thought was interesting.
[164:43.04]I was like, oh, that sounds like an interesting job.
[164:44.56]I mean, I'll try that.
[164:51.72]Teach us something.
[164:53.47]Okay.
[164:54.35]I do teach you guys things all the time, I think.
[164:57.99]I feel like you guys have taken some things from this stream.
[164:59.75]Very important stuff.
[165:01.31]Of course you have.
[165:03.32]For instance, one of the things you could take from the stream is that holding your urine is not good.
[165:08.40]Your teacher has peed his pants, like pee came out.
[165:12.20]So take from the learning experience here, you've learned that, that if you need to go, you should go and you should not waste any time.
[165:19.47]Just do it, get up there and use the bathroom.
[165:23.97]I'll be back.
[165:40.42]The game crashed.
[165:40.98]I don't know when I saved it, but I think it was pretty recently.
[165:46.24]I think we're fine.
[165:49.11]I'll be back.
[166:05.56]I didn't pee my pants.
[166:07.22]I'm a comedian.
[166:08.18]I'm a comedian.
[166:08.84]I tell jokes.
[166:09.40]That's what I do for a living.
[166:10.20]I'm a comedian.
[166:11.77]Come see me at the fucking funny factory, okay?
[166:14.85]I'm there every Friday.
[166:15.95]I hope that's... I don't actually do that.
[166:18.28]Goodbye.
[167:32.26]Thanks for watching!
[169:43.74]It's kind of hot in this room right now.
[169:51.60]Teacher's gone for 15 minutes.
[169:52.74]We can leave.
[169:57.28]Wasn't gone for 15 minutes.
[169:58.34]I'm here.
[170:09.95]Yeah, all jokes aside, I hope, um... Just saw a Jerma dude stand up once.
[170:15.01]Went to the funny factory hoping to see my favorite streamer dish up some comedy.
[170:18.44]The entire time he just wouldn't stop talking about his, uh, penis.
[170:21.16]Guess he kept saying it like that and nobody laughed.
[170:23.32]You know, what you said there is, is, uh, sadly inaccurate.
[170:31.61]Because... Like, jokes like, oh, my dick!
[170:34.85]Oh, my, oh, my dick!
[170:36.71]The audience will be rolling.
[170:40.56]Let me tell you guys something about my dick.
[170:43.06]People just started laughing.
[170:45.82]We're just so much more highbrow than that here.
[170:59.91]Shitting and screaming.
[171:00.97]Yeah.
[171:01.79]That's much higher.
[171:03.73]Higher.
[171:04.19]What was that?
[171:07.13]Ugh.
[171:12.89]I just breathed pretty hard out of my nose.
[171:14.41]I think you're right.
[171:22.76]Say happy birthday to, uh, some spinach?
[171:26.34]Something spinach?
[171:27.20]Happy birthday, spinach.
[171:27.98]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing.
[171:32.88]Play some more Saints Row.
[171:35.71]Uh, by the way, uh, Sunday...
[171:39.16]Sunday is confirmed.
[171:40.09]I'm playing Resident Evil 6 co-op with Etalyx.
[171:44.25]We're not going to beat the game.
[171:45.09]We're going to play it until we both complain enough that we both just leave.
[171:50.35]Are the course really?
[171:51.19]You know.
[172:00.48]You mad if I sleep?
[172:01.22]No, go for it.
[172:01.70]I apologize if I wake you up when I scream or laugh really loud at a car accident.
[172:08.17]Alright, let's open the game back up.
[172:13.96]Which it crashed, so hopefully we didn't lose too much progress.
[172:16.52]I don't think we did.
[172:23.98]Resident Evil 6 is so bad that it's a good game.
[172:26.40]Yeah, I played it once years ago.
[172:29.88]I was going to make a video on it, but the game was so bad that I was like, I don't even care.
[172:32.72]I don't want to play more than 40 minutes.
[172:36.68]But we're going to stomach through it.
[172:37.77]We're going to force ourselves to do it.
[172:43.81]Uh, good.
[172:44.21]They're both exactly the same place.
[172:53.17]Um, might as well just go for it, right?
[172:56.39]We're right here.
[172:56.83]Thanks.
[173:05.48]Insurance fraud.
[173:06.96]Oh, you're right.
[173:08.28]I'll go back.
[173:08.72]This mask is skin grafted onto my face.
[173:41.92]You should upgrade your base.
[173:45.22]How's Gat doing?
[173:47.16]He's been stabbed.
[173:48.71]He's seen better days.
[173:51.21]If that was me, that asshole wouldn't have got away.
[173:54.85]Yeah, sure.
[173:55.45]I've been streaming for three hours?
[173:58.13]Wow.
[173:58.41]That's surprising.
[174:08.58]I didn't want to hurt anybody.
[174:09.98]What the hell are we listening to?
[174:12.88]Nothing.
[174:13.98]There's nothing on the radio.
[174:14.74]Well she didn't though.
[174:16.18]That was me humming the whole time.
[174:17.56]Excuse me?
[174:43.63]Yeah, what are you doing?
[174:44.23]Stop it.
[174:44.61]Don't.
[174:45.19]Don't make me do it.
[174:46.97]Don't make- I'm a pirate.
[174:48.03]I know.
[174:48.31]I'm a pirate.
[174:48.69]Don't make me look at that thing you wrote in chat.
[174:50.29]No, what are you doing?
[174:51.13]Stop.
[174:51.49]My Wellington.
[174:52.19]Stop that.
[174:52.49]What are you doing with my Wellington?
[174:54.19]Stop it.
[174:55.87]You know, everybody hates it.
[174:57.13]I do too.
[174:58.53]I'm so fucked up, I have to say it though.
[175:00.51]I'm a fucking goddamn- No, what am I?
[175:05.51]I like impulsively have to do something that I see.
[175:08.25]What is it called?
[175:08.69]A monkey?
[175:11.37]A monkey?
[175:14.46]You're a sadist?
[175:15.72]Alright, we have to... Oh, it's an earnest level threat?
[175:33.79]Orange threat level?
[175:34.83]What is that?
[175:52.60]I see a guy like this walking around.
[175:57.10]I'm... What the fuck is going on?
[176:31.30]Jesus Christ!
[176:34.32]Eat!
[176:34.50]Eat!
[176:34.68]Eat!
[176:34.86]Eat!
[176:35.04]Eat!
[176:35.20]Eat!
[176:35.38]Eat!
[176:35.58]Drink!
[176:35.96]Eat!
[176:36.20]Eat!
[176:36.44]Eat something!
[176:37.02]Eat!
[176:37.58]EAT SOMETHING!
[176:38.50]EAT SOMETHING!
[176:39.46]EAT SOMETHING!
[176:43.61]What the fuck?
[176:47.53]This is shocking to me.
[176:48.65]I couldn't even think of fucking anything.
[176:57.38]I can't even walk.
[177:12.10]I didn't... God damn it!
[177:13.26]I didn't want to... I wanted to right-click!
[177:16.10]Right, not... I wanted to right-trigger!
[177:23.44]Oh my fucking god!
[177:24.62]I'm fucking leaving this mission!
[177:25.94]Oh my god!
[177:27.52]Is there, like, body armor?
[177:41.02]Don't right, don't left trigger.
[177:45.95]Please watch out.
[177:47.53]Please.
[177:48.67]Get, please watch out, please, God!
[177:50.81]Watch out, watch out, watch out, please.
[178:12.73]What you mother fucker.
[178:18.02]Put down.
[178:19.62]Put him down.
[178:20.52]Put them down.
[178:22.07]Put them.
[178:26.45]That's it.
[178:29.29]I was trying to melee.
[178:30.31]I was trying to melee.
[178:31.17]I was trying to melee.
[178:32.37]I was trying to melee.
[178:33.27]I was trying to melee.
[178:34.11]I thought it was melee.
[178:35.04]I thought it was melee.
[178:36.00]Melee.
[178:36.18]Melee.
[178:36.54]I was trying to melee.
[178:38.44]Oh my god.
[178:39.12]I was trying to melee.
[178:40.96]I thought it was melee.
[178:42.20]It's not.
[178:45.54]I'm so fucking sorry.
[178:46.85]I was trying to do the melee attack.
[178:57.05]Get me out of here.
[178:57.81]Oh my god.
[179:00.95]I was trying to go up and do this.
[179:08.95]Where are we?
[179:09.71]How are we driving around like this?
[179:11.71]Will you please get...
[179:35.26]Okay, alright.
[179:36.18]We got him.
[179:36.78]No, we didn't.
[179:37.32]This is going to explode, isn't it?
[179:39.40]Grandma, don't worry.
[179:41.36]You're playing a game.
[179:42.21]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[179:45.09]Do we win?
[179:48.39]Grandma, they're not real.
[179:56.19]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[180:00.44]It's real.
[180:01.32]It's not real.
[180:01.86]It's Shogo-san.
[180:03.04]I have nothing to talk to him about.
[180:05.22]Hello?
[180:05.40]What happened, Junichi?
[180:08.82]What happened is that he left his father behind.
[180:11.26]You've run over probably 500 people.
[180:13.64]Why do you... I didn't hear your opinion, Junichi.
[180:15.86]What happened?
[180:18.44]I went to the airport to safeguard Akuji-san's arrival.
[180:21.54]I can't.
[180:22.22]Once I saw the leader of the saints making a move towards the terminal.
[180:25.53]I made my way to the plane so I could evacuate your father.
[180:29.78]His entourage willingly gave their lives to ensure his safety.
[180:34.81]What happens in the Matrix happens.
[180:36.23]No.
[180:37.09]What?
[180:37.85]Your father made it quite clear he doesn't wish to speak to you.
[180:40.79]Anything you have to say to him will go through me.
[180:43.41]You ungrateful little... Sayonara.
[180:54.70]Oh, the fucking McRiddler, yeah.
[180:56.56]The McRiddler's a fucking menace.
[181:21.02]Jerma has overdosed on normal pills?
[181:24.00]What do you mean?
[181:24.68]What does that mean?
[181:27.44]What does that mean?
[181:30.89]I don't even know what that means.
[181:34.03]The McGriddler is a terrorist?
[181:35.77]No, McGriddler!
[181:37.86]is a chaotic good character okay like every other character that anyone has ever made every single person's chaotic good nobody wants to be lawful good nobody wants to be lawful neutral nobody wants to be neutral everybody's chaotic good I'm chaotic good I'm a good person but I'm on my own rules and I'm kind of crazy and I do crazy things there's a customer
[182:12.48]I was waiting for him to get out of the way, but I don't care.
[182:16.10]You're faithful to good boy, yeah.
[182:28.17]Where is this customer?
[182:36.19]Yeah, good.
[182:36.85]We went over this before.
[182:38.05]Good boy, but a bad guy.
[182:40.35]You can be a bad guy and a good boy, and uh-uh.
[182:44.57]What's the difference?
[182:51.55]Slow and steady.
[182:57.13]Not this again, please.
[182:58.53]Not for the people, man.
[183:00.26]Altor is for profit.
[183:03.51]How am I supposed to get there in a minute?
[183:05.29]This is $10.
[183:06.13]Did you want to drive in a circle?
[183:08.59]Hold on.
[183:08.87]I got to read this.
[183:10.41]What are you saying?
[183:33.46]Remember, the McGriddler was only chaotic good for one writer's run back in 1972 to 1974, and it wasn't even that good.
[183:41.73]The definitive version of this character has existed for over 50 years, and no one agrees that a two-year run has any bearing on who he was made to be, okay?
[183:50.55]Just because your uncle wrote the run doesn't make it right.
[183:55.28]Oh, really?
[183:55.58]Okay.
[183:57.70]So, the Dark Knight trilogy considered to be the best run of Batman ever.
[184:03.92]And we don't say that, though?
[184:06.74]No.
[184:07.20]Everything else is the right one, right?
[184:12.83]You're excused.
[184:13.37]Game crashed.
[184:23.65]Good thing I saved it right there.
[184:28.94]I wonder how, um, the new Batman movie will be.
[184:32.05]I feel like it's going to be pretty good.
[184:40.18]I didn't watch Ernest Saves Christmas yet.
[184:42.22]Am I allowed to be here?
[184:43.14]You have until the 25th.
[184:46.10]So you got plenty of time.
[184:56.05]The McRiddler is the worst of the Ratman's rogues gallery.
[184:59.41]Yeah, you got plenty of time.
[185:10.32]You have the whole month of December.
[185:11.80]You're good.
[185:16.08]There's something happening outside.
[185:17.58]Alright, insurance fraud, right?
[185:33.47]Are these guys on my team?
[185:40.39]Oh my Jesus Christ.
[185:45.12]Where are they going?
[185:57.78]Don't shoot the gun.
[186:00.36]Did I kill the guy in the front seat?
[186:05.50]Wait, they didn't see me steal this car.
[186:06.78]Does that mean that... Of course you did.
[186:12.46]Did you think I could roll up in the car they were just in as a guy that wasn't a police officer?
[186:20.70]And did what?
[186:22.86]I'm not going to get in trouble for this?
[186:24.12]They don't know it was me?
[186:25.84]What am I smoking?
[186:27.00]What am I talking about?
[186:28.16]Alright, where was that?
[186:33.14]It was over here.
[186:38.63]Oh, I'm just an officer, except I'm the McRiddler.
[186:43.50]If the McRiddler pulls up in a cop car, he took it.
[186:46.70]He's not a police officer.
[186:47.79]All the normal pills?
[186:51.33]What are you talking about?
[186:52.51]Why do you keep saying that?
[186:56.68]Where's the insurance fraud?
[187:08.75]There's too many things on the map.
[187:13.91]It's the crutches, right?
[187:14.77]Where are they?
[187:19.27]Where are they?
[187:26.14]Museum district.
[187:28.64]Oh, it's because... Okay.
[187:30.04]It's because the game crashed before it saved.
[187:31.68]I understand.
[187:32.80]I understand.
[187:40.02]What's this McDonald's car?
[187:40.92]What is this?
[187:41.28]Holy shit, I want that.
[187:45.14]Vic Riddler has to have this car.
[187:49.86]This is... I'm gonna... I have to save this one.
[187:52.64]Holy moly.
[187:55.27]I gotta go to a garage right now.
[188:01.51]Where's the nearest garage?
[188:02.49]Up here.
[188:10.93]What's this place?
[188:11.77]Oh, a penthouse loft?
[188:16.97]Where should I save it?
[188:21.10]I'm going to buy this place, whatever it is.
[188:22.64]This downtown loft.
[188:23.70]Let's go.
[188:24.02]Don't mess this car up.
[188:25.60]Remember, you're not a fan of the McGriddler unless you know his... Whatever.
[188:39.12]That's really funny, but I don't even want to read it.
[188:55.13]I swear to God, some of you guys are the funniest motherfuckers ever.
[188:57.39]Everyone talks about chat.
[189:01.31]Like, oh, chat's like, yeah, fuck, fuck chat.
[189:03.61]Chat's like, oh, fucked up.
[189:04.81]I don't like it.
[189:06.99]A lot of you are, right?
[189:09.84]But man, there's a huge percentage of you guys that are fucking absolutely hysterical.
[189:12.70]$50,000?
[189:12.72]God damn it.
[189:25.73]I'm not going to tell you the percentage that I think that is because I don't want you all to get your egos inflated.
[189:34.70]I can't afford that.
[189:35.86]What can I afford?
[189:36.55]Can I afford this one?
[189:39.23]This is a penthouse.
[189:40.15]I highly doubt that.
[189:41.39]We're just going to bring it back here.
[190:07.12]No crashes at all, please.
[190:08.58]I really liked Nolan's Batman.
[190:23.60]Yeah, okay, on a rewatch recently, I was like, yeah, this is still really good.
[190:30.66]I have some issues with it.
[190:47.89]I think it's probably the best version of Batman.
[190:53.84]Although, I do like the Michael Keaton Batman.
[190:56.08]I think that was still really good too.
[190:57.99]It's tough.
[190:58.35]Danny DeVito as the Penguin is... I don't think you can ever get something that's better.
[191:14.98]Dude, scratch this car.
[191:16.34]I scratch your life out.
[191:18.63]Just make sure you know that.
[191:39.68]Get out of the way.
[191:40.48]Don't smudge up the paint.
[191:51.78]Alright, we made it.
[191:52.24]Okay, bring the car here.
[191:58.52]Into the garage.
[192:01.68]Yes!
[192:05.26]Yes!
[192:05.78]Why am I zooming in there?
[192:10.36]I don't know.
[192:10.90]I did not mean to do that.
[192:12.46]So, will this always be here?
[192:13.76]Okay, if this explodes outside somewhere, will it still be in this garage?
[192:24.19]Oh, that's amazing.
[192:25.13]Thank God.
[192:25.63]That's incredible.
[192:27.33]Alright, so now let's go over here.
[192:34.15]This way, right?
[192:34.61]Yeah.
[192:35.83]Now I can just drive around like an asshole.
[192:37.61]Perfect.
[192:51.30]Jeez, it's fast.
[193:03.29]I'm going through the bottom of the car.
[193:10.70]Saved.
[193:11.22]I just saved.
[193:11.66]I did, didn't I?
[193:23.25]Okay.
[193:23.77]Hot dog Batmobile.
[193:29.57]It's not even the right one.
[193:31.53]Wait.
[193:32.09]It's not the destination.
[193:32.87]Never mind.
[193:34.34]Off to destination.
[193:46.70]Clean.
[193:55.03]Very clean.
[194:08.42]In chat, spam a copypasta.
[194:10.00]Would you like to know the percentage of the funny people?
[194:16.85]Alright, let's actually do this this time.
[194:32.54]I'm going to fight to the death for the Hamburg Larini.
[194:34.58]It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
[194:36.96]It's not bad.
[194:38.00]You know, a woman getting ahead in the medical field is an uphill battle.
[194:42.52]I don't care what anyone says.
[194:44.35]I may be a badass, but I don't think I can change the way an entire profession thinks about gender.
[194:48.91]If I get in the brilliant book of world records for most patients served, I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient, if not more so, than their male counterparts.
[194:58.48]Alright.
[195:00.74]Where are you going?
[195:02.32]You said you were planning on treating more patients, so I figured you wanted me to hurt some people.
[195:05.76]Oh, God, no.
[195:06.46]Surgery takes a lot of time.
[195:08.10]I need you to fake multiple injuries so I can treat you faster than I normally could.
[195:11.60]Fake multiple injuries?
[195:12.90]Does that make sense?
[195:17.25]Just checking.
[195:21.29]Throw yourself into harm's way to earn cash.
[195:23.13]Okay.
[195:27.39]So I just beat myself up.
[195:28.47]Where's my car?
[195:28.91]There it is.
[195:34.40]I keep hearing bottle rockets go off.
[195:37.24]Been like that the whole game.
[195:38.19]I haven't ever mentioned it.
[195:46.82]Framley.
[195:47.70]Framley.
[195:48.54]Framley.
[195:49.44]Framley.
[195:50.28]Framley.
[195:51.12]Framley.
[196:14.44]To take a dive?
[196:17.55]What does it... What do you mean?
[196:18.31]Press... I have to press to take a dive.
[196:39.11]Oh, shit.
[196:39.47]It's a time limit.
[196:40.09]Okay.
[196:40.53]So, do I do it now?
[196:42.37]Do it now.
[196:42.69]Do it now.
[196:55.43]I'm gonna go so fast I'm gonna go right into a wall.
[197:07.19]It's alright.
[197:08.88]It's alright.
[197:09.22]It's alright.
[197:09.64]That doesn't count?
[197:28.10]Why are we all doing the same thing?
[197:37.13]Oh shit, you fall into stuff.
[197:39.45]I get it.
[197:39.81]Oh my god, this is amazing.
[198:09.15]Nice.
[198:09.41]I got plenty of time.
[198:22.86]I have an idea.
[198:24.68]I'm going to go in the supercar.
[198:26.14]I'm going to go a million miles per hour and throw myself out of the map.
[198:30.47]Does this count?
[198:31.37]Oh, oops.
[199:01.91]That's actually not a bad idea.
[199:03.57]I have to get some air though.
[199:05.99]How do I get air?
[199:07.47]That's a good question.
[199:14.97]Shit.
[199:15.58]It's gonna be close.
[199:18.60]Come on.
[199:18.94]Get over here.
[199:30.83]I'm not gonna get it.
[199:34.30]I don't, okay.
[199:35.46]Now I know what they want me to do.
[199:36.26]I get it.
[199:36.52]I understand.
[199:37.56]You need to bounce off of cars.
[199:39.18]Okay.
[199:50.69]Well, I didn't get it.
[199:51.29]I'll try it again.
[199:56.85]I understand what they want.
[199:57.59]Okay.
[200:01.71]Alright.
[200:02.35]I need, I want my good car.
[200:05.64]This'll do.
[200:17.63]The more hits you chain, the more you get.
[200:18.97]How do you bounce from car to car?
[200:30.62]Drive head onto a car.
[200:38.95]Will I fly out of the windshield?
[200:46.14]I think it's gonna start.
[200:57.82]You idiot.
[201:00.85]You can move around while you're ragdolled, OK?
[201:23.14]Motorcycle?
[201:23.80]That's a good idea.
[201:34.59]That didn't even do anything.
[201:38.95]Works better from near a fast road.
[201:48.73]I fucking can't do this.
[201:57.50]Don't drive?
[201:58.04]That kind of worked.
[202:04.07]Just go to the highway.
[202:06.47]Will that be too far away?
[202:18.41]Stop, drive.
[202:19.25]The cars are not going fast enough to make me do anything.
[202:23.09]Juggle yourself in an intersection.
[202:25.63]Oh, okay.
[202:26.19]Hold on.
[202:29.71]I gotta, like, get this down first.
[202:30.85]Alright, so there's a bunch of cars here.
[202:34.21]Oh my fucking god, I jumped over it.
[202:44.90]How the fuck am I missing that?
[202:52.58]Come here!
[202:53.38]Oh, come on!
[202:54.37]Oh, this is gonna be fun.
[202:55.31]I get it.
[202:55.77]I get it.
[203:03.93]There we go, there we go, come on.
[203:12.64]These people need to get out of the way.
[203:13.86]They're actually making them go crazy.
[203:15.68]This is actually good for me.
[203:25.13]Hey!
[203:25.95]What?
[203:26.13]That didn't count.
[203:41.04]How is this not counting?
[203:50.92]Oh, you have to die first.
[203:52.16]Okay.
[203:53.84]This intersection is fucked up.
[203:55.08]No more cars.
[203:55.68]I need more spawns.
[204:05.48]Spawns.
[204:05.88]Come on.
[204:16.46]Oh!
[204:17.60]Hurry up, you fucking slow asshole!
[204:19.78]Go!
[204:20.34]Run!
[204:20.70]I didn't even... Hurry up and drive!
[204:30.31]Oh my god, I'm not going to do it, am I?
[204:31.59]I want to get in the car and drive.
[204:36.39]No one's driving... Nobody is driving their cars.
[204:38.59]Let's do it in the marked location.
[204:44.22]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[204:54.15]Let's go.
[204:54.65]Hurry up.
[204:55.31]I know.
[204:55.59]I get it.
[205:06.35]Just go to the highway.
[205:07.25]Ignore the location.
[205:11.99]Where the fuck is this taking me?
[205:15.61]Where do I have to go?
[205:16.17]The suburbs?
[205:19.67]Is there a highway that I can do that's right?
[205:21.17]I could do right here maybe?
[205:22.09]Will this count?
[205:27.96]Any highway?
[205:28.44]It has to be in this location, though.
[205:30.64]It can't be over here.
[205:34.94]Jump off of a building.
[205:37.76]Wait, I can do it right here?
[205:39.40]No, I can't.
[205:43.88]Location doesn't matter?
[205:45.50]The timer's not going.
[205:49.99]Yeah, go to the... What are you talking about?
[205:51.51]Go to the... Chat, it's wrong.
[205:54.59]Again!
[205:55.91]Look at that!
[206:04.22]Always.
[206:08.68]You have to do it in the district.
[206:09.86]Chat is lying to you.
[206:10.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[206:13.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[206:16.91]Oh!
[206:17.59]You can't vote for that for the worst thing of the year.
[206:19.07]You can't vote for that.
[206:20.13]I've already vetoed it.
[206:21.67]I vetoed that.
[206:22.33]You can't vote for that for the worst of the year.
[206:27.01]Nope.
[206:27.31]I vetoed that one because that one doesn't count because I just told you it counts.
[206:30.12]Nope.
[206:45.89]Okay.
[206:48.20]So I'm coming up here now.
[206:52.40]Let me see if I can go in that bonus intersection.
[206:55.57]I feel like I can get string some stuff together.
[206:57.23]You get bonus adrenaline in the marked intersection.
[207:05.94]Okay.
[207:12.54]And I'm absolutely taking this motorcycle.
[207:15.82]Motorcycle is guaranteed flying off.
[207:24.74]Can I have another person?
[207:27.76]Okay, here we go.
[207:33.87]There's the highway.
[207:38.46]I think... I think I'm gonna just get on the highway.
[207:41.41]And... Can I take the road?
[207:43.55]No, I guess not.
[207:48.53]Alright, I'm ready.
[207:49.00]It does go in.
[207:53.02]It does.
[207:53.66]Right here.
[207:55.50]Let me try this part first.
[208:15.15]Yeah, timer's going, I know, I'm gonna get there.
[208:23.74]Come on, hurry up!
[208:25.02]Get to the location!
[208:26.10]Quick!
[208:35.43]Please!
[208:36.99]I'm wasting so much fucking time, you idiot Jeremy.
[208:49.67]Alright, I'm in the middle of the intersection.
[208:51.19]That was Looney Tunes.
[208:52.89]Wile E. Coyote just stepped over the cliff and fell.
[208:59.86]Come on, hit me.
[209:06.66]They're not going fast enough.
[209:08.00]This is bad.
[209:10.85]This is really bad.
[209:16.05]He scooped me.
[209:17.11]He scooped me up.
[209:17.97]It's gonna happen.
[209:19.19]I'm gonna be fine.
[209:19.77]I'm just gonna stay inside.
[209:21.25]I'm gonna stay in here.
[209:23.63]Don't move.
[209:24.79]What the?
[209:25.29]Are you serious?
[209:27.71]Scoop me again.
[209:31.48]Go!
[209:37.84]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[209:38.68]Drive, drive, drive.
[209:44.90]Why is it doing that now?
[209:46.18]Fuck you.
[209:46.68]Give me the car.
[210:00.74]STOP!
[210:22.11]I need to get scooped again.
[210:31.04]Hit me!
[210:31.46]Hit me!
[210:31.88]Hit me!
[210:32.14]Run me over, please.
[210:33.38]Adrenaline mode has been activated.
[210:34.38]What does that mean?
[210:36.64]Chain together amplified hits?
[210:38.01]How?
[210:39.51]How do I do that?
[210:41.65]How do I do this?
[210:45.89]What's that mean?
[210:56.89]Oh shit!
[211:00.17]I got it.
[211:00.55]Alright, I get it.
[211:01.17]This is fun.
[211:02.98]Oh, thank god for the scoops, Dredd.
[211:17.91]Earned $100,000 for the timer.
[211:18.37]3 minutes and 45 seconds.
[211:18.87]Holy goodness.
[211:27.45]So there is a highway right here.
[211:30.36]This is a good opportunity, I think, right here.
[211:34.04]Let's get it.
[211:39.95]Save between all of these.
[211:41.21]Give me the pickup.
[211:54.91]Build the adrenaline first.
[211:55.95]Yeah, I'm starting to understand what the game actually wants you to do.
[211:59.17]This is a Jerma985 car.
[212:23.89]Somebody just came in here and said they did surgery on a grape.
[212:28.87]And I'm remembering two or three years ago when people were all saying that.
[212:36.20]Yeah, they did.
[212:37.26]They did surgery on a grape that time.
[212:42.00]Remember that?
[212:42.98]That was from a few years ago.
[212:44.22]How do I get on this?
[212:48.78]Oh, it's the train.
[212:49.90]Never mind.
[212:55.31]Okay.
[212:55.75]That's a lot.
[213:06.60]I'm getting old?
[213:16.72]Yeah, me too.
[213:18.29]It happens.
[213:19.05]It's okay, though.
[213:21.27]Alright.
[213:23.46]I need to get over there.
[213:25.80]Give me that car.
[213:26.64]Too late.
[213:27.44]Waste of time.
[213:42.05]Run me over.
[213:42.49]Run my head over.
[213:43.75]Run over my head, please.
[213:44.54]Shit, I need a fast car.
[213:54.25]That's a fast car right there, give it to me.
[214:00.67]You fuuuck.
[214:02.32]You fuckers.
[214:06.52]Stop jumping over the cars.
[214:08.94]I can't.
[214:10.30]What a waste of time.
[214:11.31]I don't want that goddamn shit beat up sedan.
[214:14.61]I want a fast car.
[214:23.24]Stop!
[214:23.72]Stop!
[214:24.06]I need a car.
[214:33.53]Huh?
[214:37.53]The guy is still there.
[214:41.46]None of these are giving me points.
[214:44.12]Why is everybody naked?
[214:44.94]What's going on?
[214:51.27]Get out of the car.
[214:52.32]Oh, they won't stop.
[214:53.36]It's part of the game mode.
[214:54.36]They're not going to stop.
[214:55.76]I have to get my own fucking car.
[215:01.66]I'm in a lot of trouble now.
[215:04.20]There we go.
[215:04.78]Please.
[215:05.47]Keep it going.
[215:05.87]Keep it going.
[215:06.15]Keep it going.
[215:09.33]Drive first.
[215:10.39]Yeah, they all are going 100 miles per hour, though.
[215:12.37]I can't get any cars.
[215:17.29]Old Jerma would have been dying laughing at this.
[215:21.43]Yeah, well old Jerma ain't here right now.
[215:23.31]This is reformed new Jerma.
[215:28.93]Why did it- what's going on with that?
[215:30.98]That was dog shit.
[215:32.46]What was that?
[215:41.24]Stop jumping over the cars!
[215:56.89]Come on, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[215:57.69]Get up here.
[216:01.53]That'll do it.
[216:02.31]Here we go.
[216:08.43]How is this not in adrenaline mode?
[216:12.66]How is this not adrenaline mode yet?
[216:22.00]How are we not in adrenaline mode yet?
[216:32.21]Thank you.
[216:34.49]Oh!
[216:39.66]Hurry, please, please, please, do it!
[216:43.34]Why did that not count?
[216:46.02]What the fuck?
[216:50.29]Hit me!
[216:55.15]Somebody hit me!
[216:58.76]If I'm in a combo, does it keep going?
[216:59.99]I hope so!
[217:30.54]But he hit me!
[217:05.52]Where's the fucking- god. Why? It's stup-
[217:19.52]Timer still goes.
[217:29.52]Somebody hit me!
[217:34.10]That's the one!
[217:41.24]I did it!
[217:41.75]Yes!
[217:42.19]Thank God.
[217:49.91]This is fun.
[217:57.51]200,000.
[217:57.71]This time I can't be a dumbass.
[218:12.94]This is going to be hard.
[218:19.95]Well, if I can actually get the adrenaline built up, it should be pretty easy.
[218:26.39]The problem with the last one was that for a minute straight, I was stuck in the intersection, not being able to get a car.
[218:31.58]This time, I'm going to keep this.
[218:33.90]Car doesn't matter.
[218:45.73]Make sure you do nothing for two minutes again.
[218:47.36]No, I know.
[218:51.16]I don't want a car.
[218:51.84]No, I want a car to get to the adrenaline zone.
[218:55.92]And then once I'm in the adrenaline zone, I build up adrenaline and then we just go.
[219:00.23]So do not lose the car because if you get out of the car, everybody, I'm in the zone right now.
[219:05.65]So everybody's driving like a maniac.
[219:08.01]You can't get another car.
[219:10.41]I need to get to this place quickly.
[219:12.19]Quickly.
[219:13.16]Quickly.
[219:23.27]There's one right here.
[219:25.11]Alright, let's go.
[219:32.76]Run me over.
[219:39.75]Run me over.
[219:40.93]Please.
[219:42.37]Here we go.
[219:52.62]You gotta wait till there's a big concentration, like right here.
[219:57.55]Good.
[220:06.77]Almost there.
[220:07.09]I have three minutes to do this.
[220:17.44]One more.
[220:19.18]You need to move.
[220:28.39]Holy shit.
[220:29.33]That guy just... Oh, the ambulance would have been huge.
[220:41.13]Oh, yeah.
[220:46.28]Is it going to explode?
[220:46.84]I think it already did.
[221:02.53]Reminds me of flat out One two stay on the roof Huge oh, this is huge.
[221:26.90]This is huge.
[221:27.56]Oh
[221:35.95]At what point do you stop the car?
[221:37.05]I feel like I'm playing Tony Hawk.
[221:41.03]I gotta get to a million points in one combo.
[221:48.94]Oh, fuck.
[221:51.96]Oh, 150.
[221:52.06]Nice.
[221:52.24]Let's do it again.
[222:06.11]Clown Prince of Crime.
[222:15.76]Five minutes for 300,000.
[222:16.36]If we string something like that together, that's easy.
[222:18.62]Okay, I'm just making sure that didn't hurt me in real life.
[222:26.61]Again, we get a car.
[222:28.81]Drive to that place, build up the adrenaline, and then go for it.
[222:37.40]Motorcycle seems like the best idea because I can just fly off the bike and get initial points.
[222:49.05]Okay, how far away is this?
[222:50.97]Not that far.
[222:51.43]Okay, go.
[223:04.30]This just looks like a Burger King or McDonald's character.
[223:09.58]The big legs.
[223:11.26]See, if I turn around right now, there's a gigantic face.
[223:13.68]Two circles and one big smiley.
[223:17.74]Like the purple Among Us character.
[223:21.29]And I'm not saying that to be like funny and make a reference to Among Us.
[223:24.59]I'm just trying to help you visualize what I'm talking about.
[223:48.80]Okay, this is close, I think.
[223:52.38]Yeah, here it is.
[223:52.86]Bring it on.
[224:02.62]Come on.
[224:03.12]What's with the spawn bullshit?
[224:04.18]This RNG nonsense.
[224:05.42]Come on.
[224:08.68]Wasting time.
[224:21.55]Come on, drive!
[224:33.83]Good.
[224:34.47]Alright, I got plenty of time.
[224:43.25]No!
[224:48.69]That should do it.
[224:49.21]Not quite.
[224:55.48]Almost.
[225:01.99]And go.
[225:14.00]Hit me.
[225:19.38]Come on, shit.
[225:31.00]Can we drive fast?
[225:40.40]Still on pace.
[225:44.99]I need to get one of those people that drive really fast like that idiot just did.
[225:48.95]Fuck.
[225:49.65]It's okay.
[225:56.03]This time.
[226:07.45]Strive.
[226:08.29]Forget about the light.
[226:08.87]Is there a light here?
[226:14.27]Strive!
[226:14.95]Is it because the bike's in the way?
[226:15.89]Oh, this is not gonna be good.
[226:23.34]I just have to hurry up now.
[226:28.02]Come on.
[226:31.56]Hurry up!
[226:33.68]What the fuck?
[226:34.78]With no cars?
[226:43.78]I have to leave.
[226:44.24]I gotta go somewhere else.
[226:52.62]Why would you break?
[226:54.18]Drive straight ahead.
[226:54.92]Why are they breaking?
[227:02.23]They're not so considerate of my well-being now.
[227:21.84]Okay, gotta string it together now.
[227:27.69]Big truck.
[227:28.69]He don't give a fuck.
[227:36.55]Come on.
[227:42.51]Come on, go!
[227:47.61]Somebody!
[227:50.65]Somebody!
[227:57.44]Somebody!
[228:04.19]That's not gonna happen.
[228:08.39]If five cars spawn here, it's over.
[228:15.64]What a shitty inter- I'm not going to this one again.
[228:17.72]This one sucks.
[228:18.36]I'm going to this one.
[228:20.00]Go to the triangle next time.
[228:21.11]What a piece of shit intersection.
[228:33.61]Don't ever say ever.
[228:37.15]That makes me very angry.
[228:38.43]I don't know why that happened.
[228:40.51]That's infuriating what just happened.
[228:43.42]It took me off?
[228:44.72]Really?
[228:48.10]Why?
[228:51.90]What's the point of that?
[228:55.92]Why would it spawn you out?
[229:01.84]What a piece of crap.
[229:17.40]Well.
[229:22.39]Wow, what a fucking flop.
[229:35.54]Cars only spawn when you're not looking.
[229:37.88]Yeah, I think after I get adrenaline, I think I have to just leave.
[229:41.77]And just try to get flown into another intersection.
[229:51.89]I wonder.
[229:52.69]I'm going for a curveball here.
[230:01.42]Sorry.
[230:01.92]It's okay.
[230:18.67]Go.
[230:18.91]Build it.
[230:24.13]The trucks truly don't give a shit.
[230:25.53]Always aim for a truck.
[230:36.39]Look at how much they just don't give a fuck about anything.
[230:49.80]Here we go.
[230:52.80]Let me up.
[231:01.34]Come on!
[231:01.62]Speed!
[231:01.92]Speed!
[231:02.16]Speed!
[231:02.44]Give me a truck that's going fast like that one!
[231:12.57]That's not a bad place to be right now.
[231:17.89]There's a bunch of spawning truck psychos right here.
[231:25.46]There we go!
[231:26.10]Finally!
[231:27.52]Go!
[231:27.94]Keep it moving!
[231:31.29]Keep going, please.
[231:32.43]Ah, sorry.
[231:36.40]You tripped.
[231:43.16]We're gonna have to build it again.
[231:44.48]It's okay.
[231:47.90]Come on, let me get one more on the adrenaline.
[231:49.54]Let me get one more.
[232:02.47]This run's not over, not yet.
[232:03.37]Depends how fast I can build this.
[232:21.60]Don't, nobody move.
[232:22.96]Come on.
[232:29.47]One more should get it back in and we should get 150.
[232:37.15]Oh.
[232:38.47]Perfect timing for this guy.
[232:52.67]Get up!
[232:58.34]No!
[232:59.18]What the fuck are you doing?
[233:01.80]Why would you- That idiot just ruined everything.
[233:04.81]That guy ruined the entire run.
[233:07.01]By cutting that fucking guy off.
[233:08.43]Hit me!
[233:21.72]They're still tense!
[233:22.52]They're still tense!
[233:23.12]They're still tense!
[233:28.29]There's still a chance.
[233:28.75]There's still a chance.
[233:32.59]Somebody drive their car fast for the love of God.
[233:34.87]Okay.
[233:39.75]I'm in.
[233:40.09]I got it.
[233:41.86]I got it.
[233:48.96]We're good.
[233:53.45]Okay.
[233:54.15]Level four completed.
[234:07.00]Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[234:15.83]This is intense.
[234:16.39]I like this.
[234:17.93]Level 6 is really, really hard.
[234:19.71]Well, let's hope I can get to level 6.
[234:27.58]Downtown district.
[234:58.72]Oh, you know what I want to do?
[235:00.08]I know that this is just like kind of like bandwagon Andy.
[235:04.44]I want to do, I mean, we're doing the baby sensory stuff.
[235:06.94]I wonder if I can incorporate that into like a you laugh, you lose thing.
[235:11.62]Yeah, I already did.
[235:18.62]Alright, time to concentrate.
[235:29.68]Here we go.
[235:35.20]Where is this?
[235:37.49]Where?
[235:37.81]Come on.
[235:45.91]Of course you break.
[235:48.26]You idiot.
[235:50.44]There's a highway right here.
[235:51.44]This is golden.
[235:52.60]Huge opportunity.
[236:08.99]Come on, hurry up.
[236:14.87]Please just run me over.
[236:20.05]This is not working as well.
[236:21.25]It's because there's a fucking... There's a light here.
[236:33.16]If I get it, this is going to be huge.
[236:38.29]I'm doing... There's way too much momentum.
[236:49.08]That should do it.
[236:49.64]Let's go.
[236:59.33]Alright.
[236:59.65]Go.
[237:06.29]Get the fucking car out of the way.
[237:09.02]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[237:12.64]Just, no, this is nothing.
[237:13.76]No cars.
[237:14.88]There was probably 40 or 50 in a row.
[237:16.38]Now there's zero.
[237:19.97]Oh, fuck you.
[237:23.61]What's going on?
[237:31.15]What kind of physics is that shit?
[237:33.00]What?! !
[237:36.52]I bounced over it.
[237:37.56]You bounced over the car on the second half.
[237:39.82]Yeah?
[237:40.38]Is that what happened?
[238:03.28]Come on, go.
[238:10.22]Dude, all these cars are going so slow.
[238:14.46]This is a terrible place to be.
[238:15.34]This is it.
[238:22.35]Come on.
[238:30.21]Ah, fuck.
[238:31.75]This place sucks.
[238:34.51]Like, this part, this place actually sucks.
[238:37.88]It's too shitty of a location.
[238:44.34]Because they have to all break.
[238:45.62]So, this is like the end of the highway.
[238:47.47]This is an awful place to do this.
[238:51.53]I gotta go the other way on the highway.
[238:56.86]I got a plan.
[239:02.34]I have to get in the car and drive all the way over there.
[239:11.20]I want to punch the algorithm in the face.
[239:13.09]Like, spawn some cars.
[239:21.73]Oh, my fucking god.
[239:23.95]I'm just running.
[239:28.63]There they are.
[239:29.93]How am I not in this?
[239:49.83]Please just bring something together.
[239:51.41]You gonna give yourself a migraine?
[240:02.48]No, I'm okay.
[240:06.57]I have to get like 200,000 fucking points right now or else I'm in trouble.
[240:09.99]Get out of the fucking car.
[240:17.23]One of you get out of the car.
[240:20.73]I do not even have any fucking points!
[240:24.25]Someone please stop the- I can't get them to stop.
[240:28.43]Why is this happening?
[240:31.08]Why is that happening?
[240:37.20]I'm so fucking pissed right now.
[240:38.60]I'm furious.
[240:47.81]Somebody hit me this way, but there's no cars that spawn this way.
[240:56.39]Come on!
[241:01.30]Come on!
[241:02.88]Hit me again.
[241:07.90]Stop changing direction.
[241:09.14]I- I'm- I weigh like 600 pounds.
[241:11.28]It's gonna move me.
[241:11.91]I love how they avoid me too.
[241:20.67]This is stupid.
[241:26.94]You should go ragdoll to a new adrenaline zone.
[241:28.70]They're like, they're too far away.
[241:35.96]The problem is the game spawns like 10 cars in a row and then you just sit there for a minute.
[241:47.49]Game crashed.
[241:51.06]I was saving it after every mission though.
[241:52.48]That's okay, right?
[242:07.29]It's okay, right?
[242:16.87]The bridges on the highway is the best place to do it in the game.
[242:24.58]This is accurate, right?
[242:33.78]Just fuck the circle.
[242:38.40]Cars infinitely spawn on the highway.
[242:40.88]One problem with the highway is... Where's the entrance to the highway?
[242:44.68]The GPS in this game literally may as well just be like a two-year-old yelling fucking their favorite song in the backseat.
[242:50.30]So the GPS does not have any idea where to go.
[242:53.38]Where's the highway entrance?
[243:03.27]Yellow's the railroad tracks.
[243:07.35]This is a highway.
[243:13.68]How do I get onto this?
[243:18.37]Oh my god.
[243:23.85]Uh, I'm, alright, I'm gonna go do a mission.
[243:28.64]I'm gonna eat the, I'm gonna eat the controller if I don't.
[243:31.12]I gotta change it up.
[243:49.41]What about the casino?
[243:50.71]After this mission, I'll go to the casino.
[244:02.38]Ooh, that's right.
[244:04.74]Customize this car.
[244:05.70]Hell yeah.
[244:07.14]Let's do that.
[244:07.58]How do I do that?
[244:18.96]I'll take it.
[244:31.41]How do I do it?
[244:36.45]It's the wrong business of shit.
[244:39.15]What did I just buy?
[244:46.33]Oh man, nice.
[244:50.57]90,000?
[244:50.67]I love it.
[245:04.67]Not bad.
[245:10.35]Not bad.
[245:14.31]There's a brawl going on over here.
[245:38.00]That was just every single person that's ever tried to learn how to ride a bike.
[245:41.68]That was the first time you got on it.
[245:50.69]Okay, this thing is fucking stupid.
[245:52.67]I don't want this thing.
[245:56.65]Okay, do I get to keep this?
[246:00.03]Did I just spend eight grand for no reason?
[246:06.87]Do I have to bring it to a garage?
[246:10.88]Okay, I have to bring it- I have to bring it to a garage.
[246:14.58]How many cars can fit here?
[246:26.51]There's no limit?
[246:27.07]Okay.
[246:28.45]Just have to get it there.
[246:33.93]If I do a wheelie, my ass is gonna hit the ground.
[246:46.57]I wanna just ride that as long as I can.
[246:48.13]This thing is smoking.
[246:48.99]This is bad.
[246:53.88]What the fuck?
[247:11.84]Can these explode?
[247:31.11]I want to go off a jump like this.
[247:35.41]Just get huge air.
[247:36.31]Somebody said this bike is working overtime.
[247:53.82]Okay.
[248:01.19]Store it?
[248:02.27]How do I store it?
[248:02.75]There we go.
[248:11.26]Alright.
[248:12.96]Now I want my other car.
[248:35.39]No, I want a garage.
[248:56.44]Nice GPS.
[248:56.88]Although I did get there pretty quickly.
[249:05.47]This car's too fast.
[249:06.45]It actually kind of hurts my head playing it like this.
[249:13.46]Alright, customize and repair vehicles.
[249:14.86]Let's do it.
[249:16.74]What do you mean notoriety?
[249:19.50]Oh, shit.
[249:20.08]Okay.
[249:21.04]How do you get rid of the cops?
[249:24.57]How much is this going for?
[249:26.19]Take it.
[249:34.20]I think it's almost gone.
[249:48.05]Yeah, I'm good.
[249:55.78]Alright.
[249:56.48]Nitrous?
[249:59.49]Upgrade.
[250:02.44]I have upgraded nitrous.
[250:05.38]Hydraulics.
[250:06.80]Upgrade.
[250:11.10]Oh, you cannot equip both hydraulics and nitrous.
[250:14.78]Okay.
[250:16.38]Better bumper.
[250:21.20]A reinforced frame.
[250:23.38]Better torque.
[250:26.08]Ooh.
[250:26.22]Ooh.
[250:30.97]Higher durability.
[250:35.71]Body mods?
[250:37.27]What's going on outside?
[250:38.19]Okay, body mods front.
[250:43.71]I don't even... What does it even mean?
[250:45.33]Oh, okay.
[250:45.63]I see.
[250:45.97]What do I want?
[250:57.26]Deep dish pizza?
[251:01.17]Yeah, I definitely want the deep dish.
[251:03.57]That one.
[251:07.19]That one.
[251:13.92]Nice.
[251:18.34]Big ass wheels.
[251:20.96]Yep.
[251:23.86]Okay, what about the, uh, what about the hood?
[251:29.33]I don't like that.
[251:29.91]I feel like that would detach one day and decapitate me.
[251:34.02]I like this one.
[251:34.94]Keep it.
[251:35.76]Front bumper.
[251:39.02]I like the air filter.
[251:40.08]Air purifier.
[251:40.58]I like this one.
[251:48.44]I don't know what that just did.
[251:54.59]Rear mods.
[252:00.51]Oh, air filter.
[252:01.17]What about the roof?
[252:07.71]Can I not... I want to see the top of the car.
[252:09.41]Oh, is this on roof?
[252:13.43]Whoa!
[252:14.64]That's weird.
[252:15.24]I like it.
[252:15.54]No.
[252:28.28]No spoiler.
[252:35.00]It's good.
[252:36.44]Iced this plate.
[252:39.56]Uh, I guess this one.
[252:41.51]Zoss tips?
[252:42.05]I like that.
[252:44.31]Mirrors.
[252:44.61]I like that.
[252:46.19]Decal.
[252:50.83]Uh, I don't know.
[252:53.19]Here we go.
[252:53.51]Color.
[252:53.77]Is it only orange?
[253:01.66]Oh.
[253:05.48]Let's get the Jerm of green.
[253:06.52]What do you say?
[253:07.28]What do you say the color?
[253:11.22]The color's probably more like that?
[253:13.14]Like this?
[253:13.76]No, like this.
[253:18.42]It's like here or here?
[253:20.24]Like here.
[253:20.58]It's not a puke car.
[253:32.11]What are you talking about?
[253:47.80]This is my channel.
[253:58.74]And it's like a blue.
[254:09.07]It's the Joker.
[254:09.93]It's not the Joker.
[254:11.01]Oh, it is.
[254:11.37]Are those the same colors?
[254:16.16]Green, blue, and like pink?
[254:18.82]I do have the Joker colors, don't I?
[254:28.71]Okay, let's get out of here.
[254:37.50]I really am just a shitty Batman villain, I'm realizing right now.
[254:44.58]This is the exact person that would be in this car.
[254:49.06]Who?
[254:49.32]Somebody called me.
[254:59.05]Now, I'm that guy in your town that like runs his own business.
[255:02.99]And he has like that crazy car with all his business stuff all over it.
[255:05.57]And it's like a wild color scheme.
[255:06.99]And he's like walks around.
[255:07.87]He's actually dressed like in this like color scheme too.
[255:10.26]He has this number all over his car and all over his jacket and stuff.
[255:15.44]His license plate is like... Like the handyman or something.
[255:24.01]What is going on with these wheels?
[255:28.84]I did not even notice these.
[255:29.96]I didn't even touch that guy.
[255:41.90]Okay.
[255:43.64]Let's do the Ronin mission.
[255:57.80]This thing's reinforced, too.
[255:58.90]This is a good car now.
[256:12.57]I have nitrous?
[256:13.13]How do I use it?
[256:21.19]Oh my god!
[256:25.31]Turn it off.
[256:35.93]That's insane.
[256:38.75]Alright, let's go.
[256:42.61]After Kuji touched down stateside, he decided he was going to reopen the Ronin's gambling operation.
[256:48.25]We don't got to worry about the cops being on our ass for busting up the operation this time.
[256:52.19]Game's too quiet, I'll turn it up.
[256:53.09]The casino was hidden in the basement of the Marshall Winslow Rec Center.
[256:56.70]One of my boys has been staking the place out.
[256:59.06]He'll tell you how to get to the casino.
[257:01.14]Once you're inside, you should have no problem tearing that place up.
[257:07.86]Did you have fun doing the Kitboga calls?
[257:09.18]Would you do something like that again?
[257:11.06]Oh, yeah.
[257:13.60]That was a lot of fun.
[257:16.72]Kitboga is hilarious.
[257:23.61]Uh, did the game crash?
[257:25.45]I think it did.
[257:27.57]Did it?
[257:27.99]Come on.
[257:29.37]I can see it right here.
[257:30.51]It just won't... Oh, there it goes.
[257:35.03]Was that recent?
[257:35.57]That was last year.
[257:43.37]At least I saved it right there.
[257:49.04]Oh, so let me talk about this.
[257:49.98]If I want to do like a baby sensory, you laugh, you lose video.
[257:55.02]Or do you guys, should we do like a compilation where I have to sit there and no emotion?
[258:14.14]They always look so fun.
[258:21.12]Let's try that again.
[258:38.37]If you laugh, you have to quit your streaming career.
[258:40.17]I don't think I want to commit to that one.
[258:53.80]Let's put the la-la-la dog on.
[258:55.88]I've seen a lot of the compilations of like, you laugh, you lose.
[259:03.36]Like, streamer laugh.
[259:04.02]Like, I've seen like the XQC like actually laughs at memes compilations.
[259:06.74]Like, I have it on like repeat.
[259:19.43]He'll tell you how to get to the casino.
[259:21.51]Once you're inside, you should have no problem tearing that place up.
[259:32.72]Those are good.
[259:35.50]He really is such a funny motherfucker.
[259:37.14]He really is.
[259:38.44]He's just... I think his channel is fucking hilarious.
[259:54.91]Why is the woman- what's he doing?
[260:06.61]Oh, wait, we have to get this guy!
[260:08.21]Well, let's go!
[260:09.18]What are you doing?
[260:11.32]Oh.
[260:14.18]Jerma's a juicer.
[260:29.55]Why?
[260:29.75]Am I supposed to go in here?
[260:34.50]You might be the... Don't mention other streamers.
[260:40.96]It breaks my immersion.
[260:42.38]You... Why?
[260:45.09]I thought I was... That's a casino.
[260:46.65]I can't go in the casino?
[260:47.75]Well, I'm not allowed to talk about other streamers that I think are good?
[261:06.18]Now, I'll tell you, XQC has said some very, very nice things about this channel.
[261:12.04]He's said some wonderful things.
[261:14.50]And it actually does kind of mean a lot when somebody like that says nice things about you.
[261:22.85]I mean it.
[261:29.82]Just break them?
[261:40.71]Wait, I have... God damn it.
[261:46.20]I have to revive my homie.
[261:48.58]Alright, I'm going to die if I do that again.
[261:50.50]Where is he?
[261:54.56]I swear to God.
[261:56.47]Put the hostage down, man.
[261:57.95]Put the hostage down.
[262:05.61]I just want to break the stuff.
[262:21.92]Did I do it?
[262:22.44]Destroy the next room.
[262:23.62]Alright, we already did it.
[262:25.42]Let's go.
[262:26.57]Is this the next room?
[262:28.17]Where do I have to go?
[262:30.41]You have a really shitty Batman phone.
[262:33.95]You have a problem with the McRiddler?
[262:40.71]Where am I going?
[262:56.05]We love the McRiddler.
[262:57.93]I love the McRiddler too.
[263:01.87]This way?
[263:02.23]Damage?
[263:17.73]Alright, I'm just trying to do damage.
[263:18.77]Everyone leave.
[263:25.85]Stop.
[263:28.35]Why not the mic?
[263:29.19]What was it?
[263:46.24]I'm not trying to injure anyone.
[263:47.74]I'm just trying to destroy the machine.
[263:49.50]I'm doing it in the counting room.
[263:52.65]Okay.
[264:00.49]Wait.
[264:01.39]Let me do this right.
[264:06.50]Didn't I have flashbangs?
[264:07.92]Did I use them all?
[264:10.90]Why would I destroy the money?
[264:11.86]Take it.
[264:16.17]Destroy the money for what?
[264:30.66]It's sending a message.
[264:31.74]If I'm the McRiddler, I'm not the Joker.
[264:47.12]Are you using a chair to block?
[264:48.28]Alright, let's get out.
[265:00.71]Take the elevator.
[265:04.94]Leave a hamburger as your calling card.
[265:07.58]It's like a wrapped McDouble.
[265:14.01]Shit.
[265:14.27]Alright, hold on.
[265:34.84]Have it unwrapped would take one bite out of it.
[265:41.08]I like that.
[265:50.24]Wait.
[265:51.28]Very important.
[265:55.58]This is probably an achievement, right?
[265:59.68]Holy smokes.
[266:01.02]Get this guy on the Olympic team.
[266:03.72]That was insane.
[266:04.80]He handballed that.
[266:06.64]And threw it.
[266:13.75]It should be with the shell on.
[266:15.01]Did you just call the wrapper of a hamburger a shell?
[266:20.03]With the shell?
[266:21.01]Is it a peanut?
[266:22.20]What is it?
[266:22.50]A walnut?
[266:26.12]With the shell.
[266:29.85]Come on.
[266:32.87]I'm sorry.
[266:33.25]I went all the way up.
[266:46.84]I didn't even know there were people up there.
[267:02.47]It's not gonna happen.
[267:03.07]I don't care.
[267:03.41]Fuck it.
[267:03.67]Nobody move!
[267:24.24]Eating the shell is a delicacy.
[267:26.94]We talked about this before, I think, but I gotta make sure I get this in my brain and reiterate it.
[267:31.40]There was a gum that I don't know if I was lied to when I was a little kid.
[267:36.53]There was a gum that you were supposed to chew with the wrapper on because it made it better.
[267:41.29]Am I crazy?
[267:43.81]It was back in the mid-90s.
[267:49.71]I'm just going to quit gaming.
[267:50.65]I'm going to quit.
[267:51.49]I literally quit.
[267:52.23]I quit streaming.
[267:54.55]I quit forever.
[267:56.94]How is that possible?
[268:02.64]It's not even possible to do that as a gamer or live streamer.
[268:09.29]Okay.
[268:11.05]Where are we?
[268:15.79]That was a myth, but what was the gum?
[268:22.11]It was a specific gum because it had little crystals in it.
[268:25.36]I don't think it was stride.
[268:26.24]There were crystals.
[268:29.82]There were little flavor crystals.
[268:34.38]Not fruit stride.
[268:37.90]I don't think... Was it original stride?
[268:39.39]I don't think so.
[268:41.55]It was flavor crystals and it wasn't stride.
[268:43.75]Hey, I'll tell the story for the new people what I used to... Oops, I thought that was too bad, guys.
[268:53.16]I used to lie to the dentist.
[268:56.40]I thought I was being really healthy.
[268:59.12]And really, really smart.
[269:00.56]Because nobody who the fuck flosses, right?
[269:03.76]And they were like, oh, so you've been flossing?
[269:05.22]Yeah, of course I have.
[269:06.44]Also, I've been chewing Trident, too.
[269:09.54]This is a lie.
[269:10.04]I don't even know why I said that.
[269:10.90]Because Trident ran these ads that made it seem like if you chewed Trident gum, it was good for you.
[269:16.08]It was like it cleaned your tooth and shit.
[269:20.68]So I would tell the dentist that I've been chewing Trident.
[269:23.63]And they'd go, oh, really?
[269:24.89]Wow.
[269:26.07]Yeah.
[269:26.89]I'm just trying to be better.
[269:27.69]I'm trying to chew Trident and everything.
[269:39.90]No, not Orbit.
[269:42.19]This is before Orbit.
[269:50.80]My brother used to give me shit for it all the time.
[269:55.64]He'd be like, oh, yeah, I'm chewing Trident.
[269:58.08]Because he'd be in the other chair.
[270:01.09]Like, it'd be, like, one chair and the other chair.
[270:02.77]We were at the appointments at, like, the same time.
[270:09.03]I just got $10,000 for that?
[270:17.24]I know, you should floss.
[270:18.24]I'm just messing around.
[270:21.94]That was 10 grand, damn.
[270:30.58]Do I have enough to do the next one?
[270:31.52]Hmm.
[270:42.87]Whoever this is, I'm doing it.
[270:45.49]Is it ice breakers?
[270:46.37]It might have been.
[270:49.39]I'll give you some more hints on what it could have been.
[270:53.92]Protect the... Oh, this is in danger.
[270:56.44]You're right.
[270:56.82]I'm going to go do it.
[270:57.37]Let's get that guy back in here.
[271:00.09]It was in... It was not a gum that was in a box or in one of those cans.
[271:06.83]It was gum that was in individual little foil wrappers.
[271:10.48]But they weren't foil.
[271:11.06]It was paper.
[271:11.50]And you were supposed to chew the paper, too.
[271:13.70]You weren't supposed to eat it.
[271:29.93]Was I really just bullied?
[271:32.39]Yeah, you chewed the paper and they just watched me do it and they were like, holy shit, this kid is stupid.
[271:39.99]I swear more people were doing that.
[271:46.07]I'm not doing the casino right now.
[271:52.27]Cineburst.
[271:54.54]You're on the right track, I think.
[271:55.82]That same arrow.
[272:04.24]Bazooka?
[272:04.72]No, that wasn't Bazooka.
[272:13.79]You were probably the type of kid that put ketchup on corn.
[272:21.56]Don't move and you'll be okay.
[272:22.28]I'm not going to hit the gas.
[272:23.52]Alright, you're good.
[272:27.54]Why would you put ketchup on corn?
[272:28.78]What are you talking about?
[272:30.86]That's disgusting.
[272:33.64]Why would you have your house right here?
[272:35.59]Why is there a house right here?
[272:36.95]Okay.
[272:43.53]Get in.
[273:12.96]Cineburst is the gum.
[273:15.32]I think you're probably on the right track.
[273:18.38]I don't know if you're right, but I think you're close.
[273:20.68]You're in the same realm.
[273:24.93]Just put ketchup on broccoli?
[273:28.73]Ketchup I don't really like on anything besides sometimes a hamburger.
[273:31.93]A lot of times french fries.
[273:36.20]And that's kind of it.
[273:37.00]Like, what else do you put ketchup on?
[273:40.05]Besides a burger and fries.
[273:41.95]What else do you use it for?
[273:54.70]Oh, yeah.
[273:55.00]Chicken nuggets.
[273:55.62]That's another one.
[273:58.02]Real cheese.
[273:58.64]Yeah, I can see that.
[274:04.65]Pizza?
[274:05.07]No, I don't think so.
[274:09.98]Meatloaf, you're starting to lose me.
[274:14.81]Replace that with gravy and we can be friends again.
[274:26.51]Oh, it's beachfront property over here.
[274:27.82]I want to take a look.
[274:32.98]Ketchup goes inside of a meatloaf.
[274:37.03]You don't like drizzle it on top like chocolate syrup or something.
[274:51.02]Ketchup goes on shitty meatloaf.
[274:55.66]Hmm.
[275:03.41]Oh, Otto burped in my face and it tasted like a Beyond Burger and I could never eat Beyond Meat ever again.
[275:08.32]I forgot to tell that story.
[275:14.24]Okay, so I was taking... So Otto sits on the couch.
[275:16.98]We hang out.
[275:17.60]He's like, oh, let's watch TV.
[275:19.59]And he falls asleep.
[275:21.49]So I picked him up.
[275:24.01]I kind of get him, I cradle him.
[275:25.29]He's really tired and I bring him up to bed.
[275:27.31]Like, okay, it's time.
[275:28.01]Let's bring him up to... Let's go to bed.
[275:30.09]So I cradle him.
[275:30.75]I pick him up really gently.
[275:31.92]I curl him over.
[275:33.20]So his face is kind of... I'm holding like a baby.
[275:36.28]And he's up looking at me with his face kind of pointing at me.
[275:39.34]He's like, eyes are a little groggy, right?
[275:41.54]So I picked him up.
[275:42.84]I was like, okay, let's go.
[275:44.94]And at the same time, I breathed in.
[275:47.88]I was like... And he... And blew his burp into my mouth and I inhaled it.
[275:54.14]And it was the worst thing that's ever happened, I think, in my whole life.
[275:56.98]It was... I almost puked instantly.
[276:01.18]But obviously I don't want to, like, I want to make sure I hold him.
[276:03.83]And I was like, I don't want to, you know, cause a problem.
[276:06.37]So I was, like, holding him very, very steadily.
[276:08.42]But at the same time, I was like, oh my god, I'm going to puke.
[276:11.13]So I like got him up into, I put him down in the bed and he was like nice and comfortable.
[276:15.93]And I almost puked like three times.
[276:18.53]It was seriously, it tasted and smelled like Beyond Burgers.
[276:21.27]And I love Beyond Burgers.
[276:23.21]And it sucks because now I can like never eat it again.
[276:25.43]Because that's all I'm going to think about is my dog burping down into my lungs.
[276:29.03]It's disgusting.
[276:31.61]What is this?
[276:33.49]Oh, I just bought this.
[276:44.18]It sucks because I really, truly, I love Beyond Burgers.
[276:47.84]Like, I think they're great.
[276:53.39]Oh, nice.
[276:55.83]27,000.
[276:57.41]But something about the exact combination of the moment.
[277:00.73]Maybe it was something that was in the air, too.
[277:02.91]I don't know.
[277:03.37]I have no idea.
[277:04.49]It was awful.
[277:05.31]How can I not buy that?
[277:13.04]Oh.
[277:19.79]Why does it put me so far away?
[277:34.52]I'm trying to eat.
[277:35.50]Stop.
[277:35.86]Don't you know this is a stream that you should never consume anything while watching?
[277:40.23]That's important to know.
[277:44.51]Unless it's like candy.
[277:46.39]Nothing is going to gross you out from eating candy.
[277:49.69]If you're eating a bowl of spaghetti, yes.
[277:51.13]But if you're eating like a bag of M&M's, I could say anything and it wouldn't matter.
[277:56.71]Except for when you're done eating the M&M's, smell the bag and it smells like somebody shit in your house 30 minutes ago.
[278:04.14]Besides that though.
[278:08.80]Ooh.
[278:17.75]That's really not that cool.
[278:27.28]Double-seater?
[278:29.58]Holy shit!
[278:30.32]You sicko!
[278:31.22]What are you doing?
[278:31.92]Get out of here!
[278:32.54]That guy almost just took me out.
[278:36.09]Ooh.
[278:45.57]Cool.
[278:45.97]I like it.
[278:46.33]Oh, what?
[278:49.93]What?
[278:50.21]No.
[278:50.31]Okay.
[278:55.18]Okay.
[279:11.22]Okay, looks good.
[279:11.98]Oh, I got a friend down here with me.
[279:23.58]There is stuff to do over here.
[279:24.88]Put it in the garage first.
[279:34.63]Good call.
[279:36.97]Yep.
[279:49.33]How did you not get hurt by that?
[280:00.20]Okay.
[280:08.94]I've wanted the fishing pole, but I don't think you can get it.
[280:13.93]No, there's no fishing.
[280:15.75]Never mind.
[280:30.22]Why did you do that?
[280:32.20]Why did you do that?
[280:32.90]Because I wanted to see if I could get the fishing pole.
[280:37.38]Whatever happened to Jerma?
[280:38.42]It's not real.
[280:39.04]It's not real.
[280:39.66]You're punching people.
[280:40.34]You're hurting people, Jerma.
[280:41.18]Well, you're freaking out for nothing.
[280:42.28]It's just pixels, Jerma.
[280:44.70]I was scolded by chat for that an hour ago.
[280:59.48]We were kidding, but this was real.
[281:13.05]So this is, is this a prison?
[281:15.07]I think this is, yeah.
[281:16.53]So what's here?
[281:16.99]There's a couple of activities here.
[281:18.77]Nice.
[281:29.87]Ooh, that's a rare tag right there.
[281:31.63]This is the prison from the beginning.
[281:36.69]Oh, okay.
[281:53.76]Great, let's go.
[282:00.15]Cinnaburst, Mintaburst, and Fruitaburst all had edible wrappers and flavor crystals.
[282:04.25]They are the gum you are thinking of 100%.
[282:05.93]So I wasn't crazy.
[282:08.80]Oh, it's assassination mission.
[282:14.58]Okay.
[282:21.94]I feel like they weren't edible though because after a while it would still be paper and I would want to fish it out of my mouth.
[282:26.36]Let me get up there.
[282:39.66]What is this?
[282:40.10]It's a rock.
[282:53.67]And this is a lot of enemies here.
[282:56.73]Whoa, was that like a tacos?
[282:58.65]What is that?
[282:59.03]It's like food.
[283:09.88]Oh, it's a fight club.
[283:11.61]Okay, I thought it was like four tacos.
[283:13.71]Maybe I'll do this first.
[283:18.33]I gotta go faster than this shit.
[283:44.05]I'm glad you can't fall off.
[283:45.11]Alright, that wasn't bad.
[283:56.05]Gold medal.
[283:56.43]Let's go.
[284:06.56]Can I not... I wonder if I can get in here.
[284:16.67]No, let's go around the other side.
[284:21.09]What happened to my friend?
[284:21.79]I can buy the prison?
[284:32.34]How much is it?
[284:33.48]I don't even know how to get up here.
[284:55.27]Maybe a dock?
[284:55.79]Okay.
[284:56.29]I guess I could just climb up this.
[285:03.40]Okay, I made it.
[285:13.73]Now where?
[285:17.53]Ooh, lighthouse!
[285:30.67]How much is it?
[285:34.00]$30,000.
[285:37.88]Access your stored cash, weapons, clothes, and vehicles here.
[285:40.14]Customize and increase your style rank.
[285:43.38]That's very expensive.
[285:45.83]Aww.
[285:51.11]I don't have enough to do anything.
[286:04.84]I have money, though, stored, don't I?
[286:05.80]Get out of the fucking way.
[286:15.07]The boss is here.
[286:15.65]You step out of the way.
[286:32.85]He was standing in front of the cash stash.
[286:35.93]I said out loud, Where's the cash stash, mate?
[286:39.83]Look for the cash.
[286:41.53]Didn't say anything.
[286:42.19]Stood in the way.
[286:42.75]And I tried to get by him and he stood in the way and didn't move.
[286:47.02]Talking about, I'm the Joker.
[286:48.80]You're like one of the guys with the masks on.
[286:52.32]You're gonna get punched in the face.
[286:53.98]Nothing up here.
[287:07.07]Holy shit, I can climb that.
[287:07.97]That stupid cannonball.
[287:17.10]Am I in jail?
[287:22.30]Why am I in the prison?
[287:36.01]I wanted to play with him.
[287:46.81]I didn't mean to puke.
[287:58.49]Yeah, this is the beginning of the game.
[287:59.67]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[288:04.53]I own this lighthouse.
[288:07.01]Hitman?
[288:22.81]Can I let you out?
[288:26.21]Can't open it.
[288:31.77]Doors don't open.
[288:32.49]I'm trying.
[288:32.87]Can I press a button to let everybody out?
[288:53.94]I'm lost.
[288:59.62]Shit, I don't know how to get out of here.
[289:11.17]Yard?
[289:18.31]Ooh, there it is.
[289:19.75]Fight club.
[289:36.08]I'm getting hungry.
[289:36.58]What should I eat?
[289:40.91]Oh my goodness.
[289:46.89]Oh, they're going to arrest me if I do that.
[289:55.20]Oh no.
[290:02.81]My club time.
[290:04.85]Wait.
[290:05.05]Back out and save.
[290:06.00]Alright.
[290:06.42]How long of walks do I take?
[290:08.00]10 minutes? 15?
[290:29.73]Only ten minutes, yeah.
[290:31.65]I think this is a good walk.
[290:33.27]Three.
[290:33.77]Two.
[290:34.43]One.
[291:03.67]I did get that 30% increase, which is showing itself.
[291:06.43]Look at how much more damage I'm doing.
[291:12.12]This is awesome.
[291:27.41]This is just like the masked singer of like prison fights.
[291:31.12]Like who am I, right?
[291:42.19]Did somebody's stage light just fall on my head?
[291:53.41]Although you probably could guess who I was.
[291:56.11]Judging by how large I am.
[291:59.56]In comparison to everybody else.
[292:06.56]I wonder who the giant fat guy in the purple question mark suit is.
[292:11.86]There's no way he's the giant fat guy in the prison.
[292:16.36]Yeah, it wouldn't even work.
[292:17.67]I'm stupid.
[292:18.39]Whatever.
[292:22.35]You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
[292:32.62]Classic.
[292:33.34]Classic comeback.
[292:43.17]That's an Adam Sandler joke.
[292:44.15]I didn't claim that.
[292:44.93]I said that's a classic joke.
[292:46.31]I didn't say it.
[292:47.08]I didn't make it up.
[293:00.71]I need more moves.
[293:13.32]eaten these pretty quick.
[293:19.84]In fact, you mentioned Adam Sandler, and I am almost certain that there is a character in Billy Madison from that movie where the principal is just this guy.
[293:35.53]The principal of Billy Madison is the character I'm playing.
[293:38.49]His name was The Blob, and he had a purple mask.
[293:45.91]The revolting blob.
[293:56.28]He was a former pro wrestler called the blob.
[293:58.64]Yeah.
[294:05.47]You know, I haven't seen those movies in a long time.
[294:07.01]It's been years.
[294:08.41]I wonder if my rose colored glasses, whatever, are showing.
[294:13.36]But I remember those movies being funny.
[294:16.18]They were actually humorous.
[294:19.12]There's a part where a dog, the funniest part of the whole movie for me, was Adam Sandler's watching a TV show.
[294:25.75]And it's like a family sitcom.
[294:27.59]And there's a real just regular dog that like they got to like, they gave it like a treat or something.
[294:32.17]Or they like barked on camera.
[294:34.29]And they dubbed over it.
[294:35.77]And the dog goes, no, so speak for yourself, moron.
[294:39.21]And he starts laughing hysterically at it.
[294:40.61]And I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen when I was like 15.
[294:55.35]I did a podcast last year where I watched all 62 Adam Sandler films in 62 days.
[295:00.25]Well, this is a funny joke, but there's like 15.
[295:10.74]It was funny.
[295:11.42]Everybody's just so negative.
[295:15.06]I thought it was funny.
[295:15.98]If I remember.
[295:27.47]He's made a ton of movies.
[295:30.27]I don't think... I don't think there's 62 Adam Sandler movies.
[295:34.76]Let me see if I can name 10.
[295:36.32]Okay, let's think.
[295:40.44]Billy Madison.

[301:41.08]I fucking hate this.
[301:43.96]Why?
[301:44.30]I thought I had a parachute or something.
[301:45.40]It said parachute last time I jumped up that high.
[301:52.05]I'm stuck in the goddamn prison again.
[301:54.49]Get me out of here.
[301:55.17]Can I fast travel?
[301:59.95]I just wanted to just hurry up and get down there.
[302:01.75]I just didn't want to be up there anymore.
[302:04.58]Get me out of here.
[302:08.26]I fit through the window.
[302:09.02]I'm actually stuck here.
[302:14.78]Again.
[302:37.64]Give me help, please.
[302:41.50]Why can't I just jump over this?
[302:46.03]Why?
[302:46.37]I don't know how to get out of here.
[303:01.64]Okay.
[303:02.16]I'm going to turn around.
[303:02.78]I'm going to go this way.
[303:08.27]And then I'm gonna go this way.
[303:10.11]I'm trapped here.
[303:16.38]There's nowhere to go.
[303:16.90]It's the infirmary.
[303:29.76]I need the yard.
[303:30.38]Where's the yard?
[303:37.64]Holding area.
[303:38.22]Yeah, there's no map.
[303:42.60]Vodka is gross.
[303:44.20]Yeah, vodka sucks.
[303:45.50]It's awful.
[303:46.72]The only thing that's good about vodka is if you get like a decent vodka, you can kind of mix it with stuff.
[303:53.10]Thank fucking lord, get me out of here.
[303:57.55]I actually think vodka is probably up in S tier for me just because it's the base of a lot of things that I like.
[304:04.96]I really like Moscow Mule.
[304:06.70]It was good.
[304:08.73]I like a vodka pineapple, vodka cranberry.
[304:16.83]I drink realistically maybe five to ten times a year.
[304:23.84]I'm still stuck here.
[304:37.66]I didn't know these opened.
[304:38.78]Alright, let's go.
[304:54.53]I did the same thing!
[304:56.87]I can't!
[305:03.62]Ugh!

[305:36.93]No, I'm not I know where to go
[305:42.61]Stop pretending I got shit to do later.
[305:44.36]I'm not.
[305:45.56]I'm serious.
[305:47.18]My... My, like, puny, like, pea-sized bird brain thought I could get out and jump over there.
[305:54.64]Like, I was like, I can make the jump.
[305:56.00]I didn't... The last time I did that, I didn't truly try to jump.
[306:01.35]I kind of fell.
[306:02.77]And I'm like, no, I can make the jump this time, right?
[306:04.47]Like, my brain was like, you can just make the jump.
[306:06.05]It's fine.
[306:08.41]Thinking that he was... I didn't know I was going to ragdoll.
[306:14.86]You just went in a circle?
[306:35.57]Get me the fuck out of here.
[306:37.81]I'm never coming back to this island again.
[306:46.00]It's not a way out.
[306:52.75]There's one way to get out of here.
[306:56.57]They're trying to keep us in here.
[306:58.67]Of course they are.
[306:59.47]It's a prison.
[307:05.42]I need to get out of here.
[307:09.72]Can I activate a cheat code to fly and just fly?
[307:11.76]Please.
[307:11.90]Please.
[307:14.87]You spawn next to it, go into the holding cell.
[307:25.54]It's like, oh, I'm in the yard now, but... There's no map in here.
[307:31.87]Like, I can't... There's no map in this place.
[307:34.61]I want to be able to look.
[307:40.37]All I can see is this little mini-map.
[307:41.49]I can't zoom out or zoom in.
[307:59.58]I'm fucking swimming, I don't even care.
[308:00.82]Oh my god, give me my car.
[308:17.35]Yes!
[308:25.67]Leave this place in the dust.
[308:35.33]I wanna go here.
[308:51.58]I think you might need a casino break.
[309:06.19]How are you faster than a jet ski?
[309:10.23]How did you survive?
[309:11.85]But I did.
[309:14.17]I did too.
[309:27.58]Yeah, one more mission to completing the whole Ronin storyline.
[309:29.74]Really?
[309:30.00]I want to watch this guy hit the invisible wall and then I'll go back.
[309:36.34]I want to make sure it exists.
[309:53.22]Are both of us already there and I just don't know yet?
[310:05.49]Is this an optical illusion?
[310:06.53]Oh, wait, hold on.
[310:11.64]Oh, wait, I think... What's that other boat?
[310:15.36]Where did this come from?
[310:16.08]Wait, we're not... No, we're not there.
[310:21.90]Where the fuck did I go?
[310:36.21]Okay, I made it.
[310:36.65]I thought I was back in the prison and I was about to be really upset.
[310:50.27]It was like an oil tanker or something.
[311:05.52]With 13 respect, do missions, you dickhead.
[311:07.76]I know.
[311:08.32]I'm just having a blast, alright?
[311:10.25]Will you let me have a little bit of fun?
[311:12.89]I don't have to do only missions.
[311:35.49]This is a mayhem mission.
[311:38.90]You guys feel like handbraking a car like that would just snap the handbrake off?
[311:43.74]Is this normal?
[311:44.20]Oh yeah, we've just been in our safe amounts of radiation.
[311:52.01]Then why are you in a hazmat suit?
[311:56.04]I refuse to acknowledge it.
[311:59.77]I think that's the play.
[312:40.40]You get a bonus for destroying compact cars.
[312:44.75]Ooh, big combo!
[313:01.64]Are you fucking kidding me?
[313:10.89]Really?
[313:11.21]Do it again.
[313:13.31]I'm just gonna do this.
[313:24.82]Fuck it.
[313:25.14]I have an infinite amount.
[313:42.93]Your grenade cheating?
[313:43.87]There's no such thing.
[313:50.20]Ooh, take that out.
[313:53.66]How did that not destroy anything?
[314:05.06]Holy fucking shit!
[314:07.57]Oh my god, dude.
[314:10.47]I did it!
[314:10.83]End the mission!
[314:29.21]Truckyard district.
[314:30.01]Fences are worth 50 times more than anything else for some reason.
[314:38.30]I start seeing holy freaking shit instead of holy f-word.
[314:55.77]Wait a minute.

[315:25.37]K6, I think.
[315:32.52]What is this?
[315:34.66]Gold-plated GDHC?
[315:36.68]How did I get these?
[315:40.70]Okay, cool.
[315:57.41]But I do want to buy... I think I want that.
[316:00.61]I want it.
[316:06.75]This looks like battle pass.
[316:09.45]Where are my golden pistols?
[316:14.54]There we go.
[316:22.61]Alright.
[316:23.19]Equip that shit.

[317:08.03]Let's hit these.
[317:09.15]Here we go.

[317:40.55]That's what I'm saying.
[317:41.15]What are you saying that's what I'm saying?
[317:44.91]That's what I'm saying?
[317:45.66]I'll do one more.
[318:04.29]What's the that's what I'm saying thing?
[318:19.00]Search it online.
[318:21.32]I don't use the internet.
[318:24.13]Rots your brain.
[318:24.79]Same thing with that disgusting, dirty, Satanic television.
[318:30.97]I'm looking for fence.
[318:34.29]Fences.
[318:48.64]Need some fencing.
[318:49.36]And we... Guarantee.
[318:57.41]Actually, get out.
[318:57.87]I got a combo.
[319:03.29]Why would you swing a rocket launcher, you fucking moron?
[319:06.00]Are you kidding me?
[319:08.60]You are gonna baseball swing a rocket launcher?
[319:22.44]Holy shit.
[319:31.33]Almost screaming like that.
[319:44.48]It sounds so hated.
[320:00.96]Didn't hit anybody?
[320:10.65]Uh... Oh.
[320:13.65]Flamethrower now available at your crib weapon cache.
[320:15.97]Nice.
[320:19.21]After I'm done with this, we're going to go and finish the Ronin storyline.
[320:22.65]And then that'll probably be it.
[320:25.33]That point of fire will be six or seven hours by then.
[320:48.75]Bonus.
[320:49.25]I need way more than this.
[320:52.84]I gotta get in a better spot.
[320:53.70]Not enough shit over here.
[321:09.28]up, didn't you?
[321:10.10]I need more shit to destroy.
[321:14.16]There's not much.
[321:23.89]Very much.
[321:33.23]Very much here.
[321:49.02]There ain't much.
[321:49.58]I'm so pissed.
[321:53.52]Here we go.
[322:01.82]There ain't much.
[322:21.58]Here we go.
[322:47.42]Jeez, there's still so much more that I have to destroy.
[322:50.42]I got to get to a place so I can string together.
[323:00.57]There's not much over here.
[323:01.63]There really ain't much.
[323:02.75]There's not much.
[323:03.47]Fences, I know.
[323:03.95]I'm looking for them.
[323:10.65]Here we go.
[323:15.45]Fence.
[323:17.34]Do these fences not count?
[323:20.32]Are you kidding me?
[323:21.54]How do these not count?
[323:29.71]I'm not even in the right place.
[323:32.43]Oh my god.
[323:36.63]I didn't... I'm sorry.
[323:37.69]I went outside of my zone.
[323:44.85]Where is it?
[323:45.21]Get in the car quick.
[323:50.56]What are you doing?
[323:57.65]I got plenty of time.
[323:58.31]I'm fine.
[324:06.25]Get up!
[324:35.98]So fucking many of you.
[325:10.15]What?!
[325:10.43]Is that a fence?
[325:17.85]I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[325:26.37]It's gonna be close.
[325:43.29]450?
[325:43.41]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[326:01.48]Alright, we're good.
[326:04.60]Iron thousand.
[326:13.29]That was tight.
[326:15.80]Two more levels after that, too.
[326:19.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[326:20.50]I think I'll give this one... I think I'm going to leave.
[326:22.48]I'm going to leave.
[326:23.38]Because I don't want the game to crash.
[326:25.64]That would be a disaster.
[326:30.31]We're going to go do the last couple of Ronin missions.
[326:34.47]One here.
[326:43.60]I need a car.
[326:47.92]Use cheats?
[326:48.38]I don't need to use cheats.
[326:54.40]There are way more.
[326:56.15]Are there?
[326:56.43]Oh shit.
[327:04.61]There's 15 more missions.
[327:05.99]Forget them and play around with the amazing supply of cheats.
[327:09.87]Okay.
[327:10.73]Alright.
