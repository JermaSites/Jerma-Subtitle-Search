[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.87]So sudden, somebody said.
[00:03.21]So sudden.
[00:05.79]What do you mean sudden?
[00:07.49]I've got a time frame.
[00:10.49]I could show up at 1 o'clock.
[00:11.49]I could show up at 1.59.
[00:14.14]Or 2.
[00:15.80]Or 2.15.
[00:17.88]Carrying a bunch of fucking grocery bags.
[00:21.22]I may have been late, but I was at the grocery store and I have all the groceries.
[00:27.02]Six or seven bags on each hand.
[00:31.20]Because I don't know about you guys.
[00:33.20]I don't do multiple trips going back and forth from the car.
[00:37.57]You do all of it.
[00:39.39]So you only have to do it once.
[00:42.11]Sure, it hurts a little and it's a little bit of pain.
[00:45.63]But you get everything done.
[00:51.57]He's so proud of that.
[00:56.54]One and done.
[00:57.10]Yeah, exactly.
[01:01.85]700,000 bags of milk.
[01:03.81]No.
[01:05.79]But, hello.
[01:07.27]I've returned.
[01:09.17]I was back from TwitchCon a day or two ago, but didn't stream.
[01:14.41]Had some other stuff to take care of.
[01:16.73]But, we're back!
[01:19.05]For good!
[01:20.71]Not that we were gone for good, either.
[01:25.92]I saw people in the pre-stream chat, they said, you've got to tell us some stories.
[01:30.80]Okay.
[01:32.42]You ready for some wild TwitchCon stories?
[01:36.96]How about this one?
[01:38.70]Whoa.
[01:40.56]So at the TwitchCon party.
[01:43.70]Wow.
[01:44.66]Huge concert.
[01:45.60]People fucking partying in the front on the field.
[01:48.08]It was at Petco Parks.
[01:50.02]It was a huge thing.
[01:53.45]I sat behind home plate.
[01:55.81]Where there was nobody there.
[01:57.17]Me and like five or six people.
[01:58.51]We just watched.
[02:00.01]From like a mile away.
[02:03.47]Just kind of sitting there.
[02:05.33]Enjoying the concert.
[02:11.33]No.
[02:11.73]Somebody said people watching.
[02:13.02]No.
[02:15.48]We essentially were doing a helicopter tour.
[02:17.60]That's how far away we were.
[02:18.78]Just sitting there.
[02:21.82]It was kind of nice.
[02:25.63]Did I have a toothpick?
[02:26.47]Yes, I did.
[02:28.41]At some point.
[02:31.41]And I'm sure there's going to be lots of pictures that people have.
[02:35.25]Yeah, this one in the chat.
[02:37.61]Yeah, people are saying, how do you react to, how are you going to react to, in gigantic quotes, Look, I squished Jerma in Photoshop.
[02:49.60]Let me see, how do we react to this?
[02:51.00]What the fuck?
[02:52.72]What the fuck?
[02:55.10]The fuck did you do to me?
[02:56.38]I'm not that small!
[02:57.54]Is that what you wanted?
[03:05.09]This one isn't even trying!
[03:07.29]Look at the- look at the ceiling!
[03:10.35]They actually just took the crop tool, grabbed from the top of the picture, and then squished it down, and then stretched it.
[03:18.56]That one's not even trying!
[03:23.55]What about the stain on my pants?
[03:25.65]Yeah, I saw the one where somebody- I saw the piss one where somebody made it look like I pissed my pants.
[03:37.64]You guys are some... There's just so many fake pictures out there.
[03:44.09]I don't even know which one is the real one.
[03:46.60]You know what I mean?
[03:47.84]When you take a picture, and it gets circulated a million times, and it's edited a million times, and you show one of those, you show them edit number 600,241, that person probably thinks that edit is real.
[04:05.33]Case in point, somebody put text on my shirt in one of those posts.
[04:11.23]I didn't have text on my shirt, and somebody said, why the fuck is he wearing that shirt?
[04:14.99]It's like,
[04:16.45]I d- I wasn't wearing that shirt, is exactly what happened!
[04:21.06]Dude, what the f- wha- what happened?
[04:24.16]Did he piss his pants?
[04:25.70]No!
[04:25.92]No!
[04:31.18]How do- how do we combat fake data, is what I wanna know.
[04:36.49]Cause it's all fun and games.
[04:39.07]It's all fun and games until it starts like World War 3.
[04:46.50]This is the future, yeah.
[04:52.47]But no, TwitchCon was awesome.
[04:54.53]I had a great time.
[04:56.11]Met a lot of people.
[04:59.11]It was fantastic.
[05:01.44]Lots of new stuff coming out of TwitchCon.
[05:05.42]The next project is already being worked on.
[05:08.62]And ooh, is it gonna be good.
[05:11.16]This time, I ain't gonna give you any details.
[05:14.04]But just know that somewhere in, um, somewhere in December, January-ish, uh, you're gonna get something else.
[05:20.15]And it's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty fucking cool.
[05:22.15]That's all I've gotta say.
[05:23.57]Cool.
[05:24.35]Alright.
[05:25.13]Today, we are going to play Hitman 2's DLC.
[05:29.79]We got cut off last time, last week.
[05:32.23]So I'm gonna play it.
[05:36.72]We have to finish one of the missions.
[05:39.36]There's one more area.
[05:40.98]And then I kind of... I want to go back and do the first area again.
[05:48.33]It's Untitled Goose Game.
[05:52.63]Community stream when?
[05:53.65]Right.
[05:53.85]Okay, I said I was going to talk about that too.
[05:55.55]I will probably do the community stream.
[05:57.03]I'm going to go three days in a row.
[05:58.33]So what we're going to do today is going to be Hitman.
[06:00.79]Tomorrow, something weird.
[06:02.53]Something that I don't... I might have to change games within 10 seconds or I'll be addicted for 10 hours.
[06:07.76]I don't know.
[06:08.90]I just know that it exists and I'm going to try it.
[06:11.74]And then Friday, I'm going to try to compile all those images and all those things for the community night on Friday.
[06:19.20]So the end of this week.
[06:21.11]That sounds like a plan to me.
[06:27.65]Oh shit, I gotta work.
[06:31.71]Well, I did say that I was gonna do it right, like, kind of right after TwitchCon, I was gonna, we were gonna do it.
[06:35.95]So, I mean, TwitchCon was this last weekend.
[06:39.43]But, let's get started.
[06:41.68]Don't waste any more time.
[06:42.66]Let's play the second area in Hitman 2.
[06:46.20]And let's just enjoy Hitman 2.
[06:47.42]You know what I mean?
[06:49.74]Let's enjoy it.
[06:55.25]Because this is probably going to be the last time that I play this game.
[07:01.97]I can't imagine going back to doing more Hitman 2.
[07:04.43]So let's get all we want out of it today.
[07:08.43]How's that sound?
[07:10.19]This one's called The Last Resort.
[07:16.83]Why is everybody doing the D phase?
[07:22.25]What?
[07:28.63]I don't get it.
[07:29.11]Oh, it's because it's the... By the way, all my other monitor is just that image of me, like... And here's the thing about, like... Here's the thing about, like, the fake... I can't even talk about it.
[07:42.12]I will in a minute.
[07:51.24]I'm, like, spouting off about fake media, so...
[07:56.94]But it's true though!
[07:58.52]It's actual fake media that's supposed to be presented as real!
[08:01.90]It's true, it's fake.
[08:20.60]To the public, they specialize in reputation management for the rich and famous.
[08:25.47]The real money, however, comes from the covert reconstruction of identities for wealthy criminals.
[08:31.43]They make people disappear.
[08:34.03]the partners are using haven to acquire new identities yes yes it's true that it's fake attempting to hack the haven this is gonna get real weird in 10 years manually resetting the access keys every 10 hours that unfortunately makes them targets
[08:58.80]It's called Haven.
[08:59.42]Cool.
[08:59.58]Okay.
[08:59.86]Do I get to drive a boat?
[09:00.96]I hope I can drive a boat.
[09:02.52]That's the first thing I'm going to try.
[09:04.18]I don't care about anything else.
[09:05.42]Okay.
[09:32.85]For example, we'll be sending you in as a potential new client.
[09:37.18]We've put together a convincing cover story.
[09:39.82]Mr. Reaper, a thief for hire, looking to disappear for a while.
[09:43.89]And he loves the water and he loves boats.
[09:46.15]You need to eliminate the three owners of Haven.
[09:50.14]Tyson Williams, founder and rumored tyrannical CEO of Haven.
[09:54.24]This guy.
[09:56.06]A former confidence artist hired by Williams to serve as a client recruiter and handler.
[10:01.43]And Stephen Bradley, technical wizard and the brains behind Haven's proprietary software platform.
[10:07.11]What?
[10:08.27]Well, good luck.
[10:08.69]I don't do shit.
[10:09.05]I just send you off and stand over here till you're done.
[10:34.80]But I'm a very, very... I'm very good at assassinating people, too.
[10:45.84]Where's the multiplayer?
[10:47.20]Come on.
[10:49.62]Where's the co-op for this mission?
[10:51.07]DLC co-op with that guy.
[11:00.07]Alright.
[11:01.05]So, we've got...
[11:05.75]Jesus, okay.
[11:06.59]So we got Tyson Williams, Stephen Bradley, and Ludmila Vitrova.
[11:19.75]Let's go to the planning stage.
[11:20.83]Resort.
[11:21.21]Okay, coins.
[11:21.99]I always like to take a few coins.
[11:24.14]I would prefer apples, but I don't know.
[11:25.80]They're not available.
[11:26.58]They better be available in this mission or I'll be very upset.
[11:31.78]This guy's wearing welding glasses.
[11:34.42]Okay, good to know.
[11:36.58]I think we're good.
[11:37.04]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:38.00]I got something better than this, right?
[11:39.41]Yeah.
[11:41.61]Looks good.
[11:43.15]Alright, I'm ready.
[11:43.93]Gonna play him professional.
[11:49.09]We just got big bits just came in.
[11:50.59]Freddy Dredd just gave 5,000 bits.
[11:55.01]Thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[11:56.91]I don't know how to use Twitch, but I love you, Jerma.
[11:58.97]Made this account for you.
[12:03.55]Well, thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[12:04.77]You figured it out.
[12:06.57]I think you got it working.
[12:08.31]I appreciate that, though.
[12:11.88]That's a lot of money.
[12:15.87]Thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[12:20.43]Made this account from me.
[12:21.79]Freddy Dredd watches Jerma.
[12:23.31]That's fucking crazy.
[12:24.37]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[12:40.37]I also made this account for you.
[12:42.15]How many of you guys made your account last night?
[12:44.79]Why did you just put on extra glasses?
[12:46.33]Providence partner data is what I need.
[13:07.68]I get to drive a boat.
[13:08.82]I knew it.
[13:10.38]I didn't, but he did.
[13:12.12]Jealous.
[13:16.68]Jealous.
[13:25.13]Damn it.
[13:29.41]Okay.
[13:30.21]Did I take the bag?
[13:31.93]Alright.
[13:32.41]I gotta... Okay, hold on.
[13:40.23]God damn it.
[13:40.65]I wish I could fly one of those.
[13:41.61]Alright.
[13:43.29]So we just get up here.
[13:45.01]This is a nice place.
[13:45.69]A little chunky.
[13:51.71]It's a little chunky right now because my computer sucks.
[14:02.02]I thought that guy was pissing.
[14:06.44]Alright, so we have to look for some intel.
[14:08.84]Let me look at the map.
[14:11.32]There's one right here!
[14:13.00]Easy.
[14:15.79]I need to get a better computer.
[14:16.97]I know I do.
[14:23.95]Is this open?
[14:24.77]No.
[14:25.86]Anything in there?
[14:26.30]I don't know.
[14:27.44]Alright, let's go to the welcome center.
[14:29.28]I think the welcome center is over here.
[14:30.44]Might as well go through the front door.
[14:39.59]My shadow is messed up.
[14:42.83]Yeah, well, that's what a 1080 gets you.
[14:49.07]Okay.
[14:50.71]Key to the private hut.
[14:52.35]Welcome to Haven.
[14:53.57]Let's do it.
[14:54.55]What do you guys got for me?
[14:55.45]There's a personal message.
[14:57.21]Alright.
[14:58.00]Can I get candy?
[14:58.64]No.
[14:58.80]I can't take a peppermint?
[15:00.00]So the key to your personal hut... Where the hell is my... Where is it?
[15:19.90]I hate when hotels do this shit.
[15:21.25]They just hand you your key.
[15:22.11]They don't even tell you where the elevator is.
[15:26.85]Here you go, Mr. Elbertson.
[15:27.83]Have a nice day.
[15:28.81]You're on like the 54th floor.
[15:31.87]I don't know where the fuck to go.
[15:33.25]Did she tell me?
[15:34.55]She told me.
[15:36.19]What did she say?
[15:38.51]Hold on.
[15:38.97]She said it?
[15:43.74]Hut on the left?
[15:46.22]Hold on.
[15:46.82]Wait.
[15:47.04]Did she actually say it?
[15:51.06]He just wanted to talk shit.
[15:52.96]Wait, hold on.
[15:53.66]I don't care about that.
[15:54.38]We don't go right to your hotel room.
[15:56.02]Anyway, you go to the bar first.
[15:58.05]This is water.
[16:00.97]This is cool.
[16:04.83]I was too... I was too invested in the candy.
[16:09.28]Oh my god.
[16:10.34]Are these pretzels?
[16:16.25]Okay.
[16:17.01]Selling off.
[16:19.09]Wait.
[16:19.31]Oh, you two aren't talking.
[16:21.83]It's these two.
[16:45.39]That'll drop the price completely.
[16:48.01]I'm selling my shares in Mushtalk tonight.
[16:49.75]I'm sitting there eavesdropping on the wrong people.
[16:55.92]Okay, you're selling your... Alright.
[16:57.44]It seems Ventrova is trying to get Jason Portman out of his hut.
[17:01.30]And she has ordered a member of staff to watch him.
[17:03.64]According to his entourage, he's planning on selling his shares in his company, Mushtalk, to Haven.
[17:10.21]Wow, okay.
[17:19.07]Can I- I wanna get on this.
[17:26.15]Maybe she thinks it's a real alligator.
[17:29.79]Look out behind you!
[17:31.47]Holy shit, I don't know what that was.
[17:37.17]What's she made out of?
[17:38.73]What are you made out of?!
[17:39.57]No, it was Intel!
[17:50.85]I don't care if the board is they what how are they going to He set this up didn't he he signed the papers passed the signature off as my own of course, you know, okay So that's it
[18:17.06]I keep thinking of the alligator.
[18:18.70]That's not cool.
[18:19.20]Alright.
[18:19.40]Okay.
[18:20.04]I need to go to my hut.
[18:20.98]Can I go back to the front desk?
[18:22.61]Excuse me.
[18:22.89]Where did you say it was again?
[18:43.95]I just, I forget.
[18:44.79]I know you had candy up here and that was a mistake.
[18:47.43]Get that out of here.
[18:48.75]You're distracting all of us squirrel people.
[18:53.02]Was it this way or to the right?
[18:58.74]Behind you on the right.
[18:59.62]Right over here.
[19:13.95]Okay.
[19:15.19]Do I have to get searched?
[19:24.45]Listen to me.
[19:25.93]You will get that whole fucking container of peppermint candies.
[19:28.75]And you bring that fucking whole container over here.
[19:31.56]Okay?
[19:32.68]You do that, there's a $50 bill.
[19:35.24]With your name on it.
[19:44.61]I want that whole fucking container.
[19:49.15]Make something up.
[19:49.75]I don't care.
[19:51.67]Alright, there's a message for me in here.
[19:55.75]Intel.
[19:57.19]A pamphlet describing the various activities available to clients visiting Haven Island.
[20:02.21]The island offers massage facilities, a full gym, yoga lessons, private huts, a fully stocked cocktail bar, and a five-star restaurant.
[20:10.03]Pretty cool.
[20:10.79]Can I just, like... Can I just do this?
[20:16.38]Can I just enjoy the resort?
[20:17.72]What if I don't want to do anything?
[20:20.08]This is awesome.
[20:25.99]I wonder how much this is a night.
[20:30.99]This is probably like $2,500 a night.
[20:32.91]Oh, there we go.
[20:36.77]Alright.
[20:40.26]Call this number.
[20:41.96]A note from Ludmilla Vitrova.
[20:44.24]I wonder what she wants from you, 47.
[20:46.64]Alright, so I have to call Petrova.
[20:54.92]Alright, let's call her.
[20:57.58]Don't ever fucking leave without one of these.
[21:03.79]You didn't think there was going to be apples in this trip, did you?
[21:07.09]Well, there are.
[21:08.45]I wish there was three.
[21:16.31]Come on!
[21:27.08]Yeah, I thought about it.
[21:47.76]Can I get that?
[21:54.56]No, get down!
[21:55.16]Oh my god, you idiot.
[22:01.90]Hold on, save the game.
[22:03.24]I gotta have a point where I... A nice save slot.
[22:05.93]Okay, there's that one.
[22:06.67]I don't remember what any of these do.
[22:10.51]I'm gonna go over here.
[22:17.87]No, I can't ride it.
[22:20.47]Wait a minute, was that the guy?
[22:21.31]I think that was the actual guy.
[22:23.21]Is this the guy that I need to get rid of?
[22:25.51]No.
[22:26.50]Alright, let's go call... Vitrova on the phone.
[22:36.52]Let's allow the water everywhere.
[22:40.10]Um... Well, the point... It's the ocean.
[22:44.07]What are you talking about?
[22:47.29]What is this?
[22:47.81]Is this a shaver?
[22:49.31]You gotta be careful with these things.
[22:51.59]I talked a lot about these... These things are dangerous.
[22:54.85]Alright.
[22:56.07]Overflow the sink in my own apartment.
[23:00.93]No, no.
[23:01.21]Turn that off.
[23:01.63]Turn that off.
[23:01.95]I don't want to do that.
[23:02.45]This is a nice place.
[23:03.01]Shit.
[23:03.43]It's okay.
[23:12.37]Can I take a bath?
[23:14.96]No.
[23:26.33]Where did that go?
[23:27.79]Okay, it's fine.
[23:28.99]There's a big dent in it, but it's alright.
[23:31.47]Let's make the call.
[23:46.30]I can't do it.
[23:46.82]I'm going to practice this.
[23:52.19]Hey, Petrova, I met you at the bar and I want to say I think we hit it off.
[23:56.51]No, I can't do it.
[23:57.03]Okay, good.
[24:01.98]I can do it.
[24:16.46]Uh.
[24:19.12]What's going on?
[24:19.72]I really wasn't nervous.
[24:20.70]An offer?
[24:20.90]Ooh.
[24:21.00]Go to the restaurant, and she has an offer.
[24:44.20]Hmm.
[24:45.14]Meet Miss Petrova at the restaurant as Mr. Reaper.
[24:49.84]Should I get new clothes?
[24:56.93]No, that's... I don't have any new clothes.
[24:58.37]Why did I do this stupid outfit?
[25:03.83]Two big butterflies.
[25:05.35]That's a nice touch.
[25:06.13]Okay.
[25:09.43]Nothing else in here.
[25:10.13]Alright, let's meet...
[25:14.08]What?
[25:15.74]What do you mean, remove safety pin for the trap door?
[25:22.22]Hold on, am I gonna 1980s cartoon villain somebody down here?
[25:32.83]Alright.
[25:34.19]Should I... I just wanna see what it does.
[25:40.28]Oh, shit.
[25:40.78]Alright.
[25:42.52]It's ice fishing.
[25:45.05]Stand on it.
[25:46.97]I can't stand on it.
[25:48.51]Get in there.
[25:50.41]Hold on.
[25:51.29]Can I be like a trap to a spider?
[25:52.95]And just pull somebody in?
[26:02.89]No, I don't think I want to do that.
[26:08.70]I think that's just a... I think I... I don't know.
[26:11.02]Maybe I dropped somebody.
[26:11.80]Alright, I gotta go to the restaurant.
[26:13.94]Let's go.
[26:14.28]Let's keep it moving.
[26:16.22]Restaurant's this way.
[26:22.18]That's the toilet.
[26:24.98]You know, I... For a tenth of a second, I believed... What do you mean trespassing?
[26:33.29]What?
[26:37.53]Trespassing?
[26:39.33]We don't share this whole thing?
[26:41.71]Let's get this private hut.
[26:43.99]Yeah, the inside... This is... I'm not allowed to be over here?
[26:56.72]This is a hotel.
[26:57.56]Yeah, but it's an outdoor hotel.
[27:01.42]I've never been in one of these before.
[27:04.20]Sorry guys, I don't have any experiences in a fucking $4,000 a night outdoor cabana place.
[27:24.66]Quick, I gotta get in there and dance.
[27:26.04]I had fun too.
[27:27.56]How do you dance?
[27:36.12]No, not subdue, dance.
[27:43.56]Let's go right here.
[27:44.90]No, order a drink?
[27:54.55]Why would you poison something in front of everybody?
[27:56.23]Alright, I don't think I can do anything here.
[28:01.82]Oh, that's cute.
[28:06.65]Alright, let's go to the restaurant.
[28:08.35]Guy's playing chess.
[28:09.09]Can I play chess?
[28:11.05]Playing chess by yourself.
[28:12.41]Isn't that how you learn?
[28:13.65]That's how you get to be next level, right?
[28:15.33]You try to beat yourself.
[28:16.21]Okay.
[28:16.35]Yeah, you play chess against yourself, so then you always have a move.
[28:19.23]Because you know you made it.
[28:37.63]And then you just gridlock yourself until you win.
[28:39.95]Until one of your brains wins.
[28:41.07]Alright, let's have the meeting.
[28:44.67]Good to see you too.
[28:45.91]What do you want to talk about?
[28:47.91]Should I sit down?
[28:50.19]No.
[28:51.09]Let's talk.
[28:51.43]Hmm.
[28:51.53]What was stolen?
[29:07.97]A USB drive containing some sensitive information.
[29:11.83]Personal information, which I would rather not fall into the hands of others.
[29:15.55]Okay.
[29:16.67]So, my offer is this.
[29:19.46]Obtain the USB drive from the thief without alerting anyone at the villa.
[29:23.42]Mm-hmm.
[29:23.92]The thief is likely still there.
[29:26.68]I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use that particular skill set of yours to... Two targets remaining.
[29:34.83]What the fuck was that?
[29:36.15]The guy in the freezer!
[30:03.25]What the hell was that?
[30:04.80]Oh, it's another one of these.
[30:06.84]She said particular skill set and I had to do it.
[30:11.28]I don't even talk.
[30:12.04]What do you mean whiny?
[30:13.74]Oh my!
[30:21.13]You!
[30:21.39]Go!
[30:21.59]Flush him out!
[30:22.29]Go for this guy!
[30:31.61]I love this game so much.
[30:36.35]These games are so fucking good.
[30:38.19]They really are.
[30:38.98]Just like so... It's just so ridiculous.
[30:42.40]I love it.
[30:45.22]Sometimes you forget just how much fun you can have in just being a dickhead in these games.
[30:53.46]Now we have to listen to that again.
[30:54.58]Alright, so I have to infiltrate.
[31:09.86]It's very good to meet you.
[31:12.78]I'm not going to do it again.
[31:14.46]Now I can pay attention to it.
[31:19.24]A thief is an employee here.
[31:24.54]A person working in Mr. Williams' villa at the other end of the island.
[31:28.52]What was stolen?
[31:30.22]A USB drive containing some sensitive information.
[31:32.26]Get the USB drive.
[31:34.08]Personal information which I would rather not fall into the hands of others.
[31:38.66]So, my offer is this.
[31:43.02]Obtain the USB drive from the thief without alerting anyone at the villa.
[31:53.42]The thief is likely still there.
[31:56.18]I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use that particular skill set of yours to gain... No!
[32:01.28]I wanted to do the apple!
[32:04.62]I thought I was gonna do the apple!
[32:11.17]Why would I have a melee item equipped?
[32:14.47]I was gonna throw, like, hit apple in the face, no, I just punched her in the face.
[32:21.31]I wouldn't even try again, no.
[32:22.51]Do you want me to be stuck here for like 45 minutes?
[32:35.09]Uh-oh, did it break the game?
[32:38.75]The next four hours of the stream is going to be this.
[32:43.79]This is what we pay you for.
[32:46.40]A generous offer.
[33:02.52]The information must be valuable.
[33:04.93]What about that plan again?
[33:08.69]Tell me more about that plan
[33:28.51]I'm sorry.
[33:29.29]We need to stop.
[33:30.92]I just was hit in the face by an apple.
[33:33.74]We're going to watch everybody here get fired.
[33:56.23]Okay.
[33:56.65]Do I have to walk with her?
[33:58.25]Alright, infiltrate the villa.
[33:59.09]I think this is fucked up.
[34:00.96]What?
[34:01.10]She's bullying me.
[34:02.22]I mean, to be fair, that hit her square in the face.
[34:05.72]It was not like in the back of the head.
[34:08.48]That was just right in the face.
[34:26.60]How come I can't pick up these?
[34:27.46]Yeah, I wonder how many teeth I knocked down.
[34:38.75]And I got it back.
[34:40.79]Just gotta rub it off a little.
[34:42.23]No big deal.
[34:45.91]Oh, I just pressed the DPI button.
[34:47.99]Alright, so let's infiltrate the villain.
[34:54.25]So that puts us... Okay.
[34:55.69]Look at how menacing this thumbnail is.
[35:03.17]Eat the apple?
[35:03.77]No, I need this.
[35:04.43]This is important.
[35:07.05]Alright, let's see.
[35:08.83]So I gotta infiltrate the villa, which is down here.
[35:15.77]I can't vault over this?
[35:16.69]Alright, we gotta go down this way.
[35:19.14]Wait, there might be more apples in here.
[35:23.83]Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs, and Clown Daddy.
[35:26.58]Both of you.
[35:27.48]Thanks for the five community subs from each of you.
[35:31.14]Oh, soda can.
[35:31.82]Perfect.
[35:33.62]What is this, ATM?
[35:35.21]Ice machine.
[35:35.83]No.
[35:37.15]Uh, actually, I probably... Did I just stab myself in the face?
[35:44.96]Alright, I think I'm gonna turn on... I'm gonna get the chef outfit.
[35:47.26]I think that'll help.
[36:01.06]Alright, let me get out the... No, I'm just going to knock him out.
[36:31.49]Turn this off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[36:38.10]Oh shit, oh no, oh no, that's bad.
[36:44.94]Command, you read me.
[36:47.33]I've got a body on the ground.
[36:54.85]Hey, come on, come on, snap out of it.
[37:03.69]No-ho-ho, goddammit.
[37:04.85]Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
[37:34.49]There you go.
[37:35.91]That should be better.
[37:36.51]Alright, I gotta become a chef.
[37:43.60]The apple is not silent, by the way.
[37:47.18]It's very loud.
[37:49.58]Everything is loud.
[37:50.66]So I need... Where's my iPod?
[37:52.84]Alright, the iPod will work.
[37:56.30]Let's get the chef to come in here.
[37:59.05]He'll figure it out.
[38:04.86]I'm gonna get behind him.
[38:11.05]I'm gonna close the door.
[38:23.26]Good.
[38:23.94]This doesn't kill him, right?
[38:26.72]I killed him.
[38:27.66]I killed him with a fucking iPod.
[38:40.60]Alright, um... Well, that's unfortunate, because I didn't want to... I really did not want to kill that guy.
[38:48.47]By the way, I feel like the iPod would break.
[38:50.33]I feel like these earphones would just snap, and it wouldn't kill the guy.
[38:54.33]Whatever.
[38:55.27]Does he know?
[38:56.23]Does he know that I'm not him?
[39:00.22]Ooh, meatball.
[39:01.90]Nice.
[39:02.24]Plate this up for Mr. Trover.
[39:03.46]Will you make it special?
[39:05.08]I'll make it unforgettable, chef.
[39:09.02]Uh-huh.
[39:12.48]What's going on?
[39:18.60]What?
[39:18.72]I'm turning the stoves on.
[39:20.20]I'm a chef.
[39:20.52]I turned on the stove.
[39:21.74]What?
[39:45.49]God damn it.
[39:46.17]And I didn't fucking save it.
[39:47.61]Oh my god, I'm too ADD in this game.
[39:52.02]I was there!
[40:04.14]I turned the stove on!
[40:06.18]Why is that so out of the ordinary?
[40:09.92]Wait a minute!
[40:10.80]The chef just turned on the stove!
[40:12.90]Let's all fucking run!
[40:35.70]I don't want to kill him.
[40:36.38]I just want to knock him out.
[40:39.07]Whatever.
[40:48.93]I don't know about this.
[40:49.81]I don't know about this guy.
[40:54.97]Well, I turned on all the stoves, but who cares?
[40:58.08]What if I had a big dinner service?
[41:06.79]I love how turning a stove on as a chef is more suspicious than hiding and throwing an apple at the target in plain sight.
[41:16.13]Come on.
[41:17.23]Save the game.
[41:21.05]Let's do this one here.
[41:25.59]This guy was destined to die.
[41:27.17]No.
[41:28.49]Alright, don't turn the stove on, but I do want the meaty bone.
[41:32.84]Plate this up.
[41:34.26]Okay.
[41:34.95]I need poison.
[41:38.07]Oh, this is awesome.
[41:39.05]Poison.
[41:40.35]Poison, poison, poison.
[41:43.21]I need poison first.
[41:49.45]Where's poison?
[41:49.95]Look at the poison.
[41:50.50]I'm trying to put it up there.
[41:51.36]Alright, just put it... Okay, I'm done with that.
[41:53.40]Where's the poison?
[41:54.12]Hey, Mike, where's the poison?
[41:55.08]Where do we keep it?
[42:20.14]Start a gas leak.
[42:24.28]Cheeseburger.
[42:25.04]Oh, yeah.
[42:28.20]Cheeseburger.
[42:29.02]Nice.
[42:29.30]Alright.
[42:36.99]Blend in as a waiter.
[42:38.77]Why do I need to do that?
[42:39.47]Okay.
[42:39.99]I gotta put this down.
[42:45.97]What is it?
[42:46.31]J?
[42:47.27]How do you drop something?
[42:48.19]G?
[42:49.19]Z?
[42:50.23]Okay.
[42:51.62]Hey, mister, I think you dropped that.
[42:53.42]Yeah, I know.
[42:53.84]I did.
[42:54.04]Alright, I need to get poison.
[42:59.38]Perfect.
[43:02.34]Where can I get poison?
[43:04.44]Don't touch that.
[43:05.00]Leave that there.
[43:06.72]Hey.
[43:08.24]Hey, would ya?
[43:11.28]Where are you at?
[43:13.02]Move it over here.
[43:14.12]No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't!
[43:15.36]Is he taking it out?
[43:16.76]No, shit!
[43:17.14]Okay, it's perfect.
[43:17.72]Perfect!
[43:17.96]Come on!
[43:18.34]Christ sakes!
[43:44.54]Alright, poison, quick.
[43:47.60]Where can I get some poison?
[43:52.60]Some hut or some... Where's like the basement?
[43:56.14]I need like a chemical basement.
[44:01.54]Is this poison factory?
[44:05.38]Staff key, got it.
[44:07.40]Save it.
[44:19.23]Poison.
[44:19.47]No.
[44:19.53]Let me take this off your hands.
[44:23.39]Let me take this off your hands.
[44:24.59]Let me help you here.
[44:25.71]Let me help you.
[44:49.09]Get out of the way!
[44:51.65]I'm trying to help you.
[44:53.95]It's my turn to do the dishes.
[44:55.60]When have you ever heard something like this?
[44:56.98]Whatever.
[44:58.62]Yeah, I got the key.
[45:00.00]Am I allowed to be back here?
[45:02.18]Oh, that's right.
[45:03.26]I'm a chef now.
[45:04.30]Okay.
[45:18.38]What about the old man?
[45:19.34]What's going on?
[45:21.32]No, poison.
[45:23.24]Poison.
[45:23.94]No, it's just soda.
[45:25.50]I mean, it could be poison, though.
[45:27.52]It is poison.
[45:29.78]If we're talking real life.
[45:31.94]The classic.
[45:33.08]Okay.
[45:34.08]Am I right, guys?
[45:34.94]Have a nice day.
[45:42.32]Yeah, yeah, not getting me this time, guys.
[45:45.41]I know you're behind me.
[45:47.77]Somebody just said that's funny.
[45:52.75]Alright, I'm getting too distracted.
[45:55.07]I really am.
[45:55.57]There's so many things to do here.
[45:57.44]There's so many places to be.
[46:13.35]I'm too distracted.
[46:14.20]I gotta focus hard.
[46:16.12]Wait.
[46:16.22]It's not ready.
[46:16.72]I missed it.
[46:17.86]Wait, she's coming in.
[46:18.36]Sir.
[46:43.70]Your breath stinks.
[46:46.42]Back off.
[46:47.08]Okay, I'm rather speechless here.
[46:49.71]Let's pretend I didn't taste it.
[46:51.35]I'll come back.
[46:52.25]You try again.
[46:53.01]He didn't even get it.
[46:54.75]That was the garnish.
[46:57.07]He didn't touch the cheeseburger.
[46:58.21]Okay, here we go again.
[47:08.22]Alright, looks good.
[47:12.48]Ooh.
[47:12.82]Your breath stinks.
[47:13.54]Wait.
[47:13.74]Vault.
[47:14.20]Poison.
[47:14.72]Alright, stop getting distracted.
[47:17.44]I need poison.
[47:18.88]Why would you be upset about extra food there?
[47:21.58]Wait up.
[47:22.06]Who are you?
[47:22.54]Do I know you?
[47:44.97]Don't even think about messing with me.
[47:46.47]Go, go, go, go, go.
[47:48.09]Yeah, I kinda do.
[48:12.47]Well, very often it's probably the most dangerous thing on this island.
[48:15.98]Now we'll just move it on.
[48:43.90]Imagine waking up to this.
[48:50.56]Free drinks!
[48:59.81]Poison where?
[49:00.35]Where's the poison?
[49:01.39]Somebody sell poison?
[49:39.20]It was an accident.
[49:41.49]I need poison.
[49:42.91]Quickly!
[49:44.85]That was fucking insane.
[49:48.11]Holy shit, man.
[49:51.31]Oh, that was just mean!
[49:56.23]Hold on, that was mean.
[49:57.73]I'm going back.
[50:01.27]Where was it?
[50:11.40]You know how hard it is for me to play these games?
[50:14.25]Some of you guys can be very, very tactical and very precise.
[50:19.73]That's awesome.
[50:20.95]But if there's an interaction, like for instance, like, I'm just gonna pick this up.
[50:23.99]I kind of have to.
[50:25.67]I have to pick this up.
[50:28.24]There was an internal struggle in my head right there.
[50:30.26]Don't pick that up.
[50:31.04]It doesn't matter.
[50:31.46]I had to pick this up.
[50:32.38]I had to.
[50:37.12]I'm watching the stream right now.
[50:39.02]I'm not participating.
[50:44.61]You and I are in the same boat.
[50:47.07]My hands have taken over.
[50:51.36]I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[50:52.90]I don't know what he's going to do next.
[50:55.64]What?
[51:02.74]That wasn't that big of a deal.
[51:03.88]Is this... I have a trash can.
[51:08.55]Uh, I would not... If I'm this person.
[51:13.17]That's... Um...
[51:15.39]Get rid of it.
[51:15.85]I'll take care of it.
[51:18.85]I'm going to save everybody.
[51:32.10]I'm going to rescue us.
[51:38.04]What?
[51:49.25]You've all been rescued.
[51:50.05]Congratulations.
[51:54.67]How did nobody give a shit about that?
[51:59.38]Wait, sandcastle.
[52:05.32]Hello there, sir.
[52:06.86]Wait, can I... What?
[52:10.22]Let me help.
[52:10.66]This is a beautiful sandcastle.
[52:13.81]Hey, I don't know who you are.
[52:15.39]Does anyone know this dickhead?
[52:17.49]Has anyone seen him before?
[52:25.32]Sorry.
[52:37.79]I'm never gonna get to the end of this mission.
[52:41.79]I'm sorry.
[52:47.60]Some guy walks over to your sandcastle and just ruins it with- he puts a big chunk of meat in there?
[52:56.31]Did you just get threatened by a gun over a sand castle?
[52:58.90]Yes.
[53:06.04]Don't do too much.
[53:12.34]Good to see you.
[53:17.16]Okay.
[53:18.00]What was I doing?
[53:18.64]Right.
[53:18.86]I need to get poison.
[53:20.76]We have to poison the thing.
[53:23.24]Right?
[53:24.01]What the hell was I doing?
[53:25.53]Yeah, poison.
[53:27.67]I'm walking by.
[53:29.31]Don't- why?
[53:29.95]I'm walking by.
[53:31.01]I'm just walking by.
[53:32.05]What the fuck are you doing?
[53:58.43]Okay, don't walk by that guy.
[54:14.91]I didn't think.
[54:16.19]Okay.
[54:17.57]Don't.
[54:18.49]Easy.
[54:18.79]There's a guy right there.
[54:20.53]Just let me look at the menu.
[54:23.98]So I need to go.
[54:25.66]We need to go over here.
[54:27.54]So I just got to turn around.
[54:28.94]Just make my way this way.
[54:30.92]Through here.
[54:32.44]If I come across poison, I can bring it back.
[54:35.48]That sounds like a plan.
[54:36.77]Alright.
[54:37.29]Good.
[54:38.29]Down this way.
[54:39.99]Watch out for the guys that know who I am.
[54:47.92]So I have a couple of choices here.
[54:49.14]Go infiltrate the villa or find poison.
[54:52.24]I think find poison is number one.
[54:57.14]I might actually be able to get poison there.
[54:58.53]I might be able to just get in as the chef.
[55:07.45]Okay, we're good.
[55:15.34]I can go through here.
[55:17.50]Right?
[55:17.66]They're not going to search me, are they?
[55:20.64]No, I can't.
[55:21.12]I'm not going over there.
[55:23.82]I know I'm not supposed to be over there.
[55:24.80]That's fine.
[55:25.25]What about in here?
[55:27.85]What the hell is this?
[55:34.13]Good.
[55:37.70]Huh.
[55:47.45]Alright, so I gotta do that.
[55:49.11]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[55:50.89]I need to... Well, I can't poison her then.
[55:53.31]Don't let... I have to... Don't poison her.

[75:46.70]Alright, I gotta move on.
[76:01.57]I can't do it anymore.
[76:02.51]I would sit here all day.
[76:03.53]I really would.
[76:06.85]I would be here for the next two hours.
[76:07.95]I swear to God that's not a joke.
[76:12.06]People wonder, like, hey, man, what do you, like, what kind of, like, what kind of games do you like to do off-stream?
[76:18.59]I wouldn't leave here.
[76:21.65]Until I had to eat food.
[76:23.39]That's the only reason why I would leave.
[76:28.21]Okay, so, uh, one target down.
[76:31.61]Now I've got to get poison.
[76:34.38]Still looking for poison.

[77:57.64]Alright, stop it.
[77:58.89]Stop running into interesting distractions.
[78:13.38]Alright, that's it.

[78:14.80]I'm out.
[78:15.02]I'm out.
[78:15.24]I'm out.
[78:15.56]Okay, one more.

[78:22.44]Never leave home without a fucking apple.
[78:23.56]That's what I gotta say about that one.
[78:25.64]Let's get out of here.
[78:27.71]Alright.
[78:28.61]I gotta infiltrate that way.
[78:29.83]I already got one of three done.
[78:36.35]So I'm a personal trainer.
[78:37.21]Does that mean I have... I mean, that's higher than security guard, right?
[78:44.68]Alright, fine.
[78:47.14]Still needs poison.
[78:58.34]Dammit, there's so many things to poison.
[79:01.34]Ooh.
[79:03.48]I just, like, took that guy's tip.
[79:05.78]I'm really sorry, but...
[79:09.70]What's that?
[79:12.55]I thought this was food.
[79:14.47]It's like, ooh, look at that.
[79:18.65]It looks pretty good, doesn't it?
[79:20.17]Steaming, nice, delicious, like hot dogs or whatever the hell it is.
[79:22.99]No, cigarettes.
[79:24.09]No.
[79:24.33]Hold on.
[79:38.65]I feel like I should follow this guy.
[79:42.48]This guy's alone.
[79:43.83]He's a security guard.
[80:08.23]Hmm.
[80:09.09]No.
[80:09.39]Too risky.
[80:09.79]It's too risky.
[80:12.53]I'm not gonna do it.
[80:14.37]Yeah.
[80:15.17]Okay.
[80:15.81]What?
[80:19.50]Wait.
[80:20.18]Might be poison in here.
[80:23.80]Oh, there's absolutely poison.
[80:24.80]This is like a tool shed.
[80:35.87]Poison.
[80:36.47]There's gotta be poison in the tool shed.
[80:41.09]There's no poison in the tool shed.
[80:46.73]How is that possible?
[80:57.08]Oh, no, this is bad.
[80:58.16]They got me in a pickle.
[80:59.40]I'm between second and third base right now.
[81:00.98]Which way do I go?
[81:02.74]Okay, out this door.
[81:08.88]Got it.
[81:09.74]Okay.

[81:16.35]I gotta save.
[81:23.99]We're good.
[81:25.21]Oh, we're good.
[81:28.94]What is this Looney Tunes shit?
[81:30.88]Alright, this is where I was before...
[81:35.81]Trespassing right now, but that's alright.
[81:38.21]I remember this is the ice... Oh, right.
[81:40.09]Okay.
[81:41.59]Okay, I remember.
[81:43.21]Don't do it.
[81:43.77]Alright, I gotta go back to that area that was before.
[81:53.96]Straight through this way.
[81:54.82]Alright, I have not been this way at all.
[82:03.89]Any intel?
[82:07.35]Potential intel.
[82:08.45]Then I would suggest you simply stay in the shade.
[82:10.99]But I promise you the sun is not as strong here as it seems.
[82:15.25]My cat also had a rare skin disease.
[82:16.81]Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[82:19.07]But seriously, I wouldn't worry.
[82:20.93]Just use plenty of suntan.
[82:23.28]I never married.
[82:24.34]Somehow all I did was focus on the money and my sick cat, Pimms.
[82:28.49]We both hated the sunlight.
[82:30.57]Uh, your skin looks fine.
[82:31.93]I don't think you need to worry.
[82:33.43]I had an assistant, Karen.
[82:36.15]Karen.
[82:36.47]Bitch.
[82:37.09]She had one simple job.
[82:38.80]Karen's job.
[82:39.10]To drop ointments into Pimms' boiled, infested body.
[82:42.04]Gotta find an ointment.
[82:42.62]Kim, uh, not Kim.
[82:44.22]Karen's ointment.
[82:45.56]Oh, I'm sorry.
[82:46.28]I have no opinion about her.
[82:49.18]Pimms was my love.
[82:50.74]And that stupid Karen suggested that I put her down.
[82:53.86]Isn't that disgraceful?
[82:54.74]Karen, find Karen.
[82:55.57]Well, if our cat was sick... So I had her put down.
[83:00.51]What?
[83:00.75]Karen, I mean.
[83:02.51]Pimms lived another six years.
[83:04.50]So you're a murderer.
[83:05.48]But she only existed to make me happy.
[83:08.77]What?
[83:09.35]Just kind of said that.
[83:10.39]I know, man.
[83:10.63]Seriously.
[83:10.89]Right?
[83:11.01]Enjoy the game tonight.
[83:39.76]We're really rooting for you this year in the championship.
[83:46.78]So I guess that was just kind of a thing to have there.
[83:48.58]Alright, what's this beach ball?
[83:51.38]Can I go in the water?
[83:52.18]I guess I can just kind of go in the water too.
[83:56.63]I gotta play the part.
[84:07.49]Guy fishing.
[84:07.99]Guy fishing.
[84:08.43]Guy fishing.
[84:08.89]Guy fishing.
[84:09.43]Guy fishing.
[84:09.97]Nothing else matters.
[84:10.89]Guy fishing.
[84:12.47]Who cares about anything else?
[84:15.74]Push guy.
[84:16.20]Push guy fishing.
[84:17.16]Push the guy fishing.
[84:18.02]Push him over.
[84:32.56]What?
[84:34.90]I'm kidding.
[84:37.00]I'm giving you something to fish.
[84:38.90]We just dropped it.
[84:40.60]I scared the shit out of this guy.
[84:41.74]This guy was sleeping standing up.
[84:46.08]At least he has another one.
[84:48.98]Oh, no.
[84:49.54]Wait, can I get the fishing rod?
[84:52.50]Hold on.
[85:00.65]What?
[85:04.41]Where'd that come from?
[85:06.25]I can't... Don't do it.
[85:13.31]Don't do it.
[85:13.87]As much... There's nobody looking at... I mean, like, there's nobody looking.
[85:19.75]I'm a personal trainer.
[85:20.91]God damn it.
[85:23.23]You wanna talk shit now?
[85:24.07]Yeah, okay.
[85:26.95]Fuck this guy.
[85:27.57]Watch this.
[85:32.77]Hey, wait a minute.
[85:36.02]You betcha can't throw shit that far.
[85:44.20]Wait, I probably should have kept the hammer.
[85:52.70]Okay.
[85:54.10]Now let's do the true timeline.
[85:56.06]Not this one.
[85:56.62]Let's do the true timeline.
[86:02.90]No, that's a gun.
[86:17.32]Did you see the thing over his head he was still alive and then he just kind of I don't he just died I guess No, this is not the true timeline I didn't mean to take the gun out oh You know what who cares I

[86:40.98]Wait, what?
[86:46.10]I can't even take his hat or anything?
[86:56.44]Ouch.
[86:58.34]Well, okay.
[86:59.24]It is the true timeline.
[87:01.70]Nothing happened.
[87:06.62]He'll make excellent bait.
[87:11.44]He just wanted to fish on vacation.
[87:13.08]I know.
[87:16.30]I'm awful.
[87:23.44]Guys, we're chaotic ADD.
[87:25.97]That's how this game is played.
[87:30.65]No, no, no.
[87:31.21]It's neutral ADD.
[87:32.63]Neutral ADHD.
[87:36.75]Idiot.
[87:47.20]Get out of here, you idiot.
[87:51.38]Alright, I can take out that camera.
[87:56.82]Wait, what's over... Hold on.
[87:57.98]Who cares about my new camera?
[87:59.01]It doesn't matter.
[87:59.93]There's something over here.
[88:01.71]There's gonna be some secret weirdo over here.
[88:03.49]I know it.
[88:05.49]Come on, give me a secret weirdo NPC.
[88:09.63]No, too bad.
[88:12.89]Okay.
[88:17.76]Okay, back to real life.
[88:20.60]Right, that's what I said.
[88:21.58]Back to the true timeline.
[88:22.52]This is the real one.
[88:23.36]I can't save it ever again.
[88:25.26]Alright, that's the grill master.
[88:28.66]I don't know.
[88:29.92]I like it down there.
[88:31.06]It's nice and cool.
[88:32.76]It's so hot up here.
[88:33.32]Man, look around you.
[88:42.96]I just want to get him.
[88:50.34]Shit!
[88:55.11]Is he gonna use it?
[88:55.85]Use it, come on.
[88:56.49]I was trying to get it to land on the grill.
[89:00.01]I can get that on the grill.
[89:01.03]I know I can.
[89:05.59]Wait a minute.
[89:06.31]No.
[89:06.43]Yeah, this is it.
[89:18.66]I need to spray tan.
[89:24.57]No saving.
[89:25.21]I didn't save.
[89:25.73]I loaded.
[89:27.37]What are you talking about?
[89:53.49]I like it down there.
[89:54.53]It's nice and cool.
[89:59.15]It's so hot up here.
[90:00.64]Man, look around you.
[90:01.70]It's beautiful.

[90:15.96]Stop!
[90:17.56]Stop doing that!
[90:19.14]There it is.

[90:20.92]I'm gonna try this one more time, then I don't care.
[90:42.45]Hold on.
[90:48.36]Just bear with me for a second.
[90:51.52]Back it up a little.
[90:52.34]Like right... right there.
[91:01.15]I don't think this is particularly funny.
[91:02.69]I just want to see if I can do it.
[91:10.36]No, I can't.
[91:11.84]Too hard.
[91:22.27]You doing the carnival stream?
[91:26.33]No, well, the carnival stream would be if there was ten people in here and we all were, like, Ouija boarding their hands on my mice.
[91:33.00]And we were all trying to pull in different directions at the same time.
[91:35.00]Alright.
[91:35.98]Let's do it.
[91:38.22]Can I not get up there from here?
[91:42.24]Okay.
[91:42.46]What's that?
[91:42.82]What's that?
[91:43.14]Someone to push.
[91:44.52]Someone to push off.
[91:46.40]Okay, this is... Wait, this is... Sorry.
[92:21.94]Um, that's gonna help!
[93:05.27]I did it!
[93:06.85]Yeah, I dove!
[93:07.66]Alright.
[93:08.22]Oh, fuck.
[93:19.26]That was a great pencil dive, too.
[93:20.82]I don't know.
[93:26.82]I like it down there.
[93:28.00]It's nice and cool.
[93:28.62]It's so fun.
[93:31.02]Shoot the fingers?
[93:31.80]No, you don't even need to shoot in that scenario.
[93:34.46]Just run up and stomp on my hand.
[93:41.50]Alright, here we go.
[93:43.26]This is going to cause a spray, which is in turn going to get this guy over here.
[93:47.20]I'm going to drag him over.
[93:48.28]I'm going to pull him over and steal his expensive ski suit.
[93:57.06]Why are you coming over here?
[94:12.87]Alright, I gotta pull this guy down or something.
[94:16.95]Why are they in these outfits?
[94:22.20]Oh, wait.
[94:29.16]Investigating distraction.
[94:30.42]Can I take these clothes?
[94:31.28]Someone's gonna hear this, right?
[94:37.19]I don't think so.
[94:37.73]Let's do an apple just to be safe.
[95:07.73]I can't take these clothes Where's the guy that was just over here?
[95:15.50]Where'd the grill guy go?
[95:19.94]I gotta use the apple, I have to
[95:29.30]When you break it, you buy it.
[95:37.62]Get over here.
[95:40.66]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[95:41.70]Okay, I think it's just time to get up there.
[96:13.21]Okay, we're good.
[96:15.29]What is a disguise?
[96:17.55]Search for the thief in the facility.
[96:19.09]What the hell am I wearing?
[96:20.35]What is this?
[96:22.94]Okay, we're good.
[96:24.00]Let's go.
[96:25.66]It's so hot out for this.
[96:34.70]Turn stove off.
[96:38.50]No, I'm just going to leave it on.
[96:40.16]Whatever.
[96:41.32]Start gas leak.
[96:42.16]No, don't need it.
[96:43.48]Alright, what's over here?
[96:44.04]Hot dog buns.
[96:47.29]People were waiting and then they got out of line.
[96:50.53]You got some... Alright, you got three different diets here.
[96:57.26]Very interesting stuff.
[96:58.28]And then you got this person down here.
[97:05.69]No, I gotta save it, because I see propane tanks.
[97:12.79]Those are McDonald's fries.
[97:17.33]Alright, looking for the thief in the facility.
[97:21.26]And there's a target up there.
[97:29.92]You're not funny?
[97:36.11]Are you talking?
[97:40.43]That's a very uncomfortable way to go in this pool.
[97:48.66]Shove guy off plank.
[97:49.68]No, that's too... That's way, way low-hanging fruit for me.
[97:55.03]And guys, I already got a low-hanging fruit in my hand right here.
[98:14.79]Looking for the thief.
[98:16.96]Wait a minute.
[98:18.42]Gonna steal that book, motherfucker?
[98:20.00]I can see you!
[98:24.16]He's gonna shove that book down the front of his pants and try to walk out.
[98:32.69]Speak?
[98:34.09]Okay.
[98:34.91]Speedboat key.
[98:36.71]A key to a speedboat.
[98:38.33]There's one docked at the pier.
[98:39.85]Nice.
[98:40.69]Escape route.
[98:56.74]I just needed to know if it could work.
[98:58.53]I just needed to know.
[98:59.95]I'm just going to surrender.
[99:02.47]That was uncalled for completely.
[99:03.85]I'm telling you.
[99:05.47]I am above the law.
[99:06.43]Don't push me.
[99:07.77]I'm not telling you again.
[99:09.51]Put your hands up.
[99:23.91]He dug himself into a hole, the stupid bastard.
[99:26.03]Fire at Wilf.
[99:27.27]Fire at Wilf.
[99:38.94]Let him fight.
[99:39.96]Let him fight.
[99:40.70]They're kicking the shit out of each other.
[99:48.17]NPC random dialogue is a blessing on all of us.
[99:54.03]It really is.
[99:54.83]Why is the problem with me going this way?
[100:03.36]Alright, I've got to find a thief.
[100:06.37]I'm looking for a guy that's stealing stuff.
[100:13.85]Let me try to get upstairs.
[100:14.69]Thief.
[100:22.70]Talk about something.
[100:23.38]Have a conversation about stealing.

[101:01.02]There's birds?
[101:01.50]Oh!
[101:01.56]What?
[101:01.70]What did I do?
[101:02.08]I just, like, walked over here.
[101:03.18]Oh, my God.
[101:03.72]Um...
[101:25.32]How do I get down?
[101:26.18]Let me see the map.
[101:39.69]Right there, on the other side.
[101:40.91]Maybe I can go from here through here.
[101:48.44]It's on the other side of the building.
[101:57.69]Give me that.
[102:03.58]It's like in here.
[102:08.32]Have a nice day.
[102:10.20]Wait.
[102:12.21]What?
[102:13.63]This is a door?
[102:14.91]Is there a secret pull-the-book thing?
[102:19.53]There's a secret door right here.
[102:26.63]Oh, shit.
[102:27.11]Alright.
[102:29.87]Where's the... Oh.
[102:32.03]I can't... I need to make a distraction in here.
[102:37.00]So I can do the evil lair.
[102:38.24]Alright, what about the TV?
[102:38.98]Yeah, let's turn the TV on.
[102:45.00]Oh, I didn't know you were here.
[102:48.52]What the fu... Ah, man.
[102:50.98]This sucks.
[102:54.45]Okay.
[102:55.53]Uh, we're here.
[103:23.17]Do I know you?
[103:27.95]Okay, I can't.
[103:30.01]It's not going to work like that.
[103:30.81]I have to distract this lady somehow.
[103:41.66]I'm thinking... I'm thinking apple right in the corner over here.
[103:45.28]Or... No, hamburger.
[103:46.54]I have to keep to the end of the game.
[103:47.52]It's my Left 4 Dead gnome coin.
[103:51.62]Excuse me?
[103:59.56]Got it.
[104:00.98]Alright, how do I close the door?
[104:03.90]Good.
[104:04.62]Now, what's this?
[104:06.76]Alright, new clothes.
[104:07.62]There's something.
[104:08.16]I need clothes.
[104:08.76]I need something.
[104:10.65]Anything.
[104:12.41]Oh, fuck.
[104:13.85]Oh, no.
[104:18.83]What?
[104:28.32]Get out of here!
[104:28.80]Get, go, get out!
[104:32.77]That was four FPS.
[104:50.14]He died with a super gun.
[105:09.68]I don't know.
[105:09.96]Close.
[105:10.26]Hurry up.
[105:10.58]Okay.
[105:10.84]The camera.
[105:11.58]The camera's gotta go.
[105:14.76]I need... I gotta shoot this with one bullet.
[105:16.72]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[105:20.67]Will anybody hear this?
[105:21.47]They don't know how to get in here.
[105:22.87]Fuck it.
[105:25.35]Do you think the maid knows how to get in here?
[105:34.24]Investigate surveillance footage.
[105:36.22]Let's go.
[105:47.83]Is this my room?
[105:52.80]Who's that?
[105:55.82]That's the guy reading the book.
[105:56.70]I told you about that guy.
[106:03.34]Yep.
[106:03.72]It's something to do with that guy.
[106:05.32]I knew it.
[106:11.13]Fresh food, though.
[106:11.71]That's nice.
[106:12.05]It gets delivered here.
[106:16.79]I have no way to get into this safe.
[106:21.50]Alright, this is where I have to be careful.
[106:27.62]So, what do we got here?
[106:28.48]A scanner?
[106:31.44]Alright, this is... I'm trespassing right now.
[106:34.40]Where's this camera?
[106:52.23]Alright, made it through.
[106:52.79]Alright, here we go.
[106:55.76]Obtain the USB from the thief.
[106:57.46]The thief is even further down.
[107:03.03]What the fuck?
[107:09.26]There's a whole aquarium down here.
[107:15.57]Alright.
[107:17.09]Should I turn the... Should I take this?
[107:18.55]No, I need a wrench.
[107:19.66]I can't do it.
[107:20.12]What about in the boxes?
[107:22.16]Nothing.
[107:22.68]Okay.
[107:26.80]Even further down.
[107:30.93]There's the giant jellyfish, whatever it is.
[107:33.19]Subdue the chair.
[107:34.03]Is the chair alive?
[107:34.75]Muffin, give me it.
[107:35.87]Computer, stop being so bad.
[108:01.16]I just wanted the muffin.
[108:02.06]What the fuck is this guy talking about?
[108:06.55]Alright, gotta keep going further down.
[108:09.11]What do we got?
[108:10.49]Poison.
[108:12.23]Turn off ventilation system.
[108:15.66]Okay.
[108:18.10]Get a water.
[108:19.06]Wait, create a water distraction.
[108:20.62]I don't need it.
[108:23.88]Oh, fuck.
[108:24.96]Why did I do this?
[108:28.36]I couldn't go down from here.
[108:29.80]Yes, I could.
[108:30.26]Everything came out of his mouth.
[108:36.92]And he spit it all out one by one.
[109:02.60]That was some Scooby-Doo shit right there.
[109:04.36]Alright.
[109:14.32]Stop!
[109:14.78]Security breach!
[109:20.47]I need your help now!
[109:22.29]Yes!
[109:22.57]Absolutely!
[109:25.23]We need to secure the area!
[109:27.47]No!
[109:27.75]Don't do that!
[109:41.51]Oh, okay.
[109:42.07]It's this one right here.

[110:46.51]That's as far as I can go.
[110:47.59]Now I gotta go through here.

[122:33.38]Nope.
[122:35.24]Damn it.
[122:36.64]There's probably a secret in there that I can't get now.
[122:38.53]Let's get the apple.

[124:04.04]Can... Alright, where is she?
[124:06.12]Should I get a gun?
[124:09.22]Is this illegal?
[124:10.42]Like, with the... Should I... I mean, does this make sense?
[124:16.11]For me to use this?
[124:19.21]Would it?
[124:22.65]I mean, I am a security guard.
[124:28.23]I'm trespassing, but aren't I a security guard?
[124:32.01]Yeah, that's me.
[124:33.07]No.
[124:33.91]Wait, that is me.
[124:46.17]Everybody in here knows this is bullshit.
[124:48.53]Alright, is there another disguise in here?
[124:54.41]Oh, this is not good.
[125:02.17]I have too many items.
[125:03.93]Alright, just get rid of, like, the... Like, the soda can.
[125:07.43]Just get rid of the soda can.

[125:19.08]Fuck.
[125:20.68]Okay.
[125:22.44]Uh... Actually, it's gonna work out, I think, in my favor a little bit here.

[125:33.33]Yeah, we're good.
[125:45.35]Alright, on my way back.
[125:58.00]Uh, okay.

[126:11.58]It's that easy.
[126:12.20]Alright, good.
[126:21.48]You're ready for war.
[126:24.28]Alright, I'm ready to call.
[126:28.56]Hey, what's up?
[126:32.18]What's up?
[126:38.94]The eagle has landed.
[126:42.12]Yes, we should.
[127:03.34]Ooh, I get to go to the spa.
[127:06.26]Yes, I get to go to the spa.
[127:07.46]I get to get, like, a massage.
[127:08.50]Oh, hi.
[127:17.01]Hello.
[127:18.25]Hello.
[127:33.23]No.
[127:34.05]That's a sacred thumbnail.
[127:35.17]I can't get rid of it.
[127:36.35]So is this one.
[127:37.61]Shit, there's too many sacred thumbnails.
[127:39.13]Which one?
[127:39.49]Uh, I guess this one.
[127:43.32]Hmm.
[127:52.96]Wait, it's me.
[127:53.55]That's her.
[127:54.09]It's me.
[127:54.87]Hi.
[127:56.11]I'm Mr. Reaper.
[127:57.59]I have an appointment.
[127:58.98]Ah, yes, Mr. Reaper.
[128:00.30]You can go right in.
[128:01.28]Miss Petrova is waiting for you inside.
[128:03.00]Thank you.
[128:03.36]Have a good time.
[128:10.05]Oh.
[128:10.95]Nice outfit, Mr. Reaper.
[128:12.99]I see you're already doing what you can to fit in.
[128:15.25]Tactical, like, gear.
[128:16.41]Follow me.
[128:17.61]I'm ready for my massage.
[128:18.97]Let's see where this ends, shall we?
[128:20.46]Hey, pal.
[128:21.62]Put it in the holster.
[128:25.52]You, leave us.
[128:30.92]Hello there, sir.
[128:34.00]Hello.
[128:36.26]Which one should I take?
[128:37.14]This one?
[128:37.78]You have the item with you.
[128:39.64]Can I have it, please?
[128:51.73]Here you are.
[128:53.73]Thank you so much, Mr. Reaper.
[128:57.67]I can't tell you how much this means to me, Mr. Reaper.
[129:00.71]I'm afraid things aren't quite as serene here as they may seem on the surface.
[129:04.65]I hope there's a double-cross.
[129:05.81]You don't double-cross the guy that's standing here like this.
[129:10.41]And it was my plan all along to have you eliminated, gods!
[129:15.72]He's not well.
[129:17.26]Hasn't been for some time.
[129:19.68]We used to be together, but his illness...
[129:24.17]I couldn't take it anymore.
[129:26.89]I don't know why I'm telling you this.
[129:29.25]He monitors my every move.
[129:32.07]I think he asked that girl to steal my information because he wants to... I don't know.
[129:37.48]Punish me?
[129:38.92]Kill me?
[129:40.46]Who knows anymore?
[129:42.12]Just one more target to go.
[129:45.56]Good work, 47.
[129:46.12]Lyudmila Vitrova has been permanently...
[129:57.13]Give me a stick.
[129:59.59]Uh, but hold on.
[130:03.39]There's more to do there.
[130:04.87]Right?
[130:05.43]It's not just... I can't do... That's... That's too simple.
[130:13.32]That's the simplest possible way.
[130:17.10]I shoot you in the back with a shotgun.
[130:20.73]Guns in Hitman... No, you don't use guns in Hitman.
[130:23.11]Hitman's like Batman.
[130:26.25]If you use a gun, you're doing it wrong.
[130:28.31]That's, therefore, all my guns are now on the ground.
[130:34.69]I'm Mr. Reaper.
[130:36.17]I have an appointment.
[130:37.69]Ah, yes, Mr. Reaper.
[130:39.04]You can go right in.
[130:40.02]Ms.
[130:40.22]Petrova is waiting for you inside.
[130:42.04]Have a good time.
[130:42.92]Thank you.
[130:45.06]Oh.
[130:45.96]Nice outfit, Mr. Reaper.
[130:48.02]I see you're already doing what you can to fit in.
[130:51.38]Follow me.
[130:51.84]I love how it's a storm.
[130:53.99]Let's see where this ends, shall we?
[130:57.63]Thunder and lightning shows up.
[131:00.67]What happens if I just let her just monologue to me?
[131:03.81]Watch this.
[131:04.05]Ready?
[131:04.21]Watch this guy.
[131:05.85]I want to see how quickly this changes.
[131:06.91]I'm going to stand in the spot that she wants to monologue in.
[131:09.55]She's going to be pissed.
[131:13.53]You have the item with you?
[131:15.43]Can I have it, please?
[131:19.65]Take it.
[131:20.43]Here you are.
[131:22.55]Thank you so much, Mr. Reaper.
[131:26.59]I can't tell you how much this means to me.
[131:31.31]Calm down, calm down.
[131:34.81]I'm slowly beginning to understand that.
[131:37.73]This isn't straight, really.
[131:41.77]Tyson, Mr. Williams.
[131:43.39]He's not well.
[131:46.19]Hasn't been for some time.
[131:48.60]We used to be together, but his illness... I couldn't take it anymore.
[131:58.57]I don't know why I'm telling you this.
[132:00.13]No, too much comedy.
[132:01.39]I'm trying to think of the perfect thing.
[132:03.25]Scissors.
[132:03.84]I think he asked that girl to steal my information because
[132:12.85]Hammer.
[132:14.17]Apple.
[132:14.53]You wouldn't even die from this.
[132:17.49]Oh!
[132:29.44]She just stepped on a split cigarette with her foot!
[132:32.16]Let's get a massage.
[132:33.46]Jesus, this is too loud.
[132:34.36]We're gonna get a massage?
[132:36.00]Ah!
[133:16.77]Okay.
[133:17.57]Whoa, wait.
[133:20.37]Wait, can I get a massage?
[133:22.00]Give me a massage.
[133:22.82]Can I have one?
[133:23.40]How do I get one?
[133:24.26]I want to get one.
[133:27.46]How do I get a massage?
[133:31.78]I want one.
[133:39.62]How do I do this?
[133:45.56]I gotta change my... Change clothes.
[133:47.36]Okay.
[133:47.84]I need to be in robes or something, right?
[133:52.86]In the changing room.
[133:57.87]Come on.
[133:58.33]I need to change clothes.
[134:01.97]Who the fuck's calling me?
[134:15.47]This storm is insane.
[134:17.05]And there's no... I don't think there's any clothes I can take.
[134:19.75]I'm gonna... Okay, here's the plan.
[134:21.35]I have to find somebody who's on vacation, knock them out, and then steal their clothes.
[134:28.60]Right?
[134:29.24]Yeah, I know.
[134:36.16]Nice FPS storm.
[134:41.10]There's nobody on vacation here.
[134:42.44]Come on.
[134:42.88]I want to get a massage.
[134:53.80]This sucks.
[134:54.38]I want a massage.
[134:59.23]What?
[135:24.73]I just wanted a fucking massage, like what the hell?
[135:57.92]You fucking messed up that guy.
[136:07.95]Well, alright.
[136:10.25]Fuck it.
[136:10.69]Well, at least we get to do this again.
[136:11.77]Why does the worker have a flashbang?
[136:17.65]That's a great question.
[136:28.46]I can't get a massage.
[136:30.27]Oh well.
[136:30.71]I'm gonna eliminate immediately.
[136:32.83]If she gets more than two words out, then I lose.
[136:34.67]Akii grants access to the Haven Villa on Haven Island.
[136:38.47]Let's go.
[136:57.68]What?
[136:57.80]Oh shit.
[136:58.08]Alright, Haven Island.
[136:59.10]Let's go.
[136:59.36]Hammer.
[137:26.09]Get up there.
[137:26.51]What are you doing?
[137:27.91]I can't get up here?
[137:35.37]Can we stop the thunderstorm, please?
[137:53.26]Alright, so now I get the key.
[137:54.92]This should take me in here.
[137:55.74]I gotta go up there and eliminate Tyson Williams.
[137:58.02]And then I have completed the mission.
[138:05.88]He's upstairs.
[138:12.36]I'm dressed as a security guard, so I should be alright.
[138:14.32]What?
[138:21.51]What?
[138:22.07]Can't go that way?
[138:28.49]Alright, we'll go out this way.
[138:45.55]Alright, hold on.
[138:46.91]We got a machine up here.
[138:50.15]Missing poison, missing poison.
[138:52.57]I'm supposed to poison the poison.
[138:56.05]Medical cabinet.
[139:00.02]Oh, that's down all the way back.
[139:01.46]It was that cabinet I couldn't open before.
[139:03.60]Alright, this should get me out here.
[139:14.29]We're gonna play really, really safe here.
[139:19.32]Got a guy right here.
[139:21.10]Save it.
[139:21.72]Check this out.
[139:22.38]Guy's going over.
[139:22.92]No, he's not.
[139:23.60]Yeah, he's going over the edge.
[139:25.30]Fuck him.
[139:25.62]You know what I mean?
[139:30.77]Okay.
[139:51.11]I can't push him.
[139:56.45]What?
[139:57.79]Why couldn't I push him?
[139:58.65]Why would you just knock someone out like that, you bastard?
[140:01.33]I mean, what the hell?
[140:03.60]Don't even think about it, buddy.
[140:05.18]Do the right thing and show me those hands.
[140:09.30]I will fucking shoot you if you don't listen to me and put those goddamn hands up.
[140:15.24]You have been warned.
[140:16.60]I will open fire.
[140:26.25]This is giant bathtub, holy shit!
[140:54.76]My CPU right now is at like 22%.
[140:58.66]What the fuck is doing this for?
[140:59.88]Okay.
[141:11.55]Here we go.
[141:13.47]Nobody in here.
[141:14.77]Just knock him out.
[141:15.73]That's all I need.
[141:17.55]Got it.
[141:18.13]Okay.
[141:18.81]Who cares?
[141:19.82]Now... That guy's out.
[141:21.80]Nobody knows.
[141:22.88]Nobody has seen it.
[141:25.65]It's now an opportunity.
[141:27.65]What does he have on the ground?
[141:28.49]Anything?
[141:29.36]Nothing.
[141:30.06]No.
[141:30.60]Nothing.
[141:30.90]I'm already wearing that disguise.
[141:32.90]What is that cool thing in the middle?
[141:35.06]Whoa.
[141:36.34]There's a huge... There's a big spiral thing here.
[141:43.83]That's cool.
[141:45.59]Alright.
[141:45.85]Not allowed in here.
[141:46.61]Good day to you, sir.
[141:53.67]Shoot it.
[141:55.05]Not right now.
[141:56.09]I've got to observe what this guy does.
[141:59.73]Shoot it or riot.
[142:04.28]I don't need to do it.
[142:07.08]Just wait.
[142:07.56]Okay.
[142:07.90]Wait.
[142:08.20]He's going to...
[142:26.13]disease what on Earth is she oh I thought she was leaning all the way back oh my god I have to make a distraction through this window she saw it she saw it oh it's
[142:54.41]What?
[142:56.07]Oh, give him the USB stick.
[142:58.75]Wait, get... USB stick?
[143:02.71]Hold on.
[143:04.64]Turn around.
[143:05.18]Turn around this way.
[143:05.84]I can't be in here.
[143:07.52]I'm currently being... Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[143:10.00]Here.
[143:10.12]You want this?
[143:10.46]Ooh.
[143:10.82]Ooh.
[143:28.77]So now everyone doesn't care that I'm with them.
[143:32.73]Yeah, that's right.
[143:34.96]I took you a place.
[143:39.80]I've pulled into second place now.
[143:47.96]I'm like putting my arms up and like making like, like, look at me, what are you doing?
[143:51.49]And I turn real quick.
[143:56.84]Oh, nice job!
[143:57.82]I got first place before!
[143:58.96]Not anymore, you fucking idiot.
[144:00.52]What's that, sir?
[144:01.26]Yeah, coming in here.
[144:06.48]Yeah, keep it real.
[144:17.51]Identify yourself.
[144:19.23]Come on, seriously?
[144:20.69]Anyone know this guy?
[144:22.15]Huh?
[144:23.47]Why aren't you listening to me?
[144:24.73]Are you deaf?
[144:31.11]I'm sorry.
[144:33.56]I just wanted to be... What's in here?
[144:35.72]Poison.
[144:36.04]Anybody want any coffee?
[144:38.26]Fuck.
[144:38.58]How far back is the save?
[144:40.56]Oh no.
[145:00.54]Why did I do that?
[145:02.08]It's so far back.
[145:08.68]It was right there.
[145:09.28]I just had to press the button again.
[145:12.63]It's alright.
[145:14.29]Wait, there's an autosave right there?
[145:17.31]Oh, shit.
[145:18.19]There really is.
[145:18.93]Saved by 2019 video gaming.
[145:31.24]We just closed it.
[145:37.87]That's not very secure then, sir, if I may say.
[145:41.11]If all it takes is a little bit of body weight.
[145:42.97]Let me just put this thing back in the safe.
[145:47.59]Change the pin code.
[145:49.73]Should I be letting him do this?
[145:50.61]Alright.
[145:52.37]That's that.
[145:53.14]I'll wire a handsome reward to your personal account, my friend.
[145:58.06]Or maybe... You know what?
[146:01.13]What's a better idea?
[146:05.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[146:20.28]What are you talking about?
[146:24.50]We got a real violent criminal on the loose.
[146:26.61]He really did a number on someone here.
[146:29.13]I wanted to shoot the gun.
[146:32.89]47, excellent work.
[146:33.49]You've just eliminated... Tyson Williams eliminated.
[146:36.57]Excellent work, 47.
[146:39.93]That's all we need to do from here.
[146:42.13]Miss Hall should be able to extract the information needed from the Haven servers.
[146:46.49]Good work, 47.
[146:50.43]I'd hate to be his neighbor
[147:20.44]My neighbor?
[147:43.71]Alright, let me just put this thing back in the safe.
[147:46.88]I want to see what's supposed to happen here.
[147:48.96]Change the pin code.
[147:51.82]Alright.
[147:53.72]Huh?
[147:56.91]I found a weapon.
[147:58.39]Calm down, calm down.
[148:00.43]I'll check it out.
[148:02.30]Didn't he just do it?
[148:03.72]He did it.
[148:04.10]You already changed the pin code.
[148:05.54]Wait, is it the guy he was supposed to... The guy that he wanted to have kill me just left the room.
[148:31.04]I guess you just got promoted a personal bodyguard.
[148:34.15]Thank you, Mr. Williams.
[148:36.27]Mike's been getting on my nerves for months now.
[148:39.37]The man's got no sense of personal space, you know?
[148:43.73]This promotion is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
[149:01.57]What's it called?
[149:03.57]What's it called?
[149:09.87]What's the thing that auto-locks onto their heads?
[149:20.94]Is it just called headlock?
[149:23.54]Aim assist?
[149:29.10]Is it in gameplay?
[149:31.93]Weapon aim?
[149:32.67]No.
[149:35.13]Mission timer, difficulty HUD.
[149:38.78]Aim assist?
[149:39.62]Off.
[149:45.92]It's not doing it.
[149:52.69]It's not in subtitles.
[149:55.63]It's called Fast Target?
[150:04.39]There's no option for it.
[150:09.27]The most of it.
[150:10.39]Rest assured, Mr. Williams.
[150:12.67]I will.
[150:13.43]No.
[150:14.93]Your new outfit's in that locker behind you.
[150:18.27]I'm just gonna do some work in here for a while.
[150:21.15]Alone.
[150:22.77]Make sure nobody comes in.
[150:24.35]Good fucking... That's actually kind of comfortable.
[150:40.51]Wait, he changed the pin code though.
[150:53.95]How many does it take to kill him?
[151:11.08]Why is he still alive?
[151:13.45]Why is he still alive?
[151:14.29]I'm just trying to make this quick.
[151:34.43]Oh.
[151:46.66]It's gonna wake him up.
[151:47.53]Are they cold?
[151:48.17]Hold on.
[151:53.14]I just want someone to come in and find him like this.
[152:19.70]Fuck, no.
[152:21.50]I need help in here!
[152:22.32]I don't know what happened to him.
[152:27.76]He's acting like a real weirdo.
[152:28.82]I'll get the outfit.
[152:36.67]Where's the outfit?
[152:37.27]Outfit.
[152:46.63]Nice.
[153:07.89]Tyson Williams eliminated.
[153:09.89]Excellent work, 47.
[153:13.27]That's all we need to do from here.
[153:15.47]Miss Hall should be able to extract the information needed from the Haven servers.
[153:19.82]Good work, 47.
[153:20.50]Fingerprints on every item.
[153:43.86]I thought she was dead.
[153:46.86]No, all my stuff was on the ground.
[153:50.18]Hold on.
[153:52.68]Is that a camera?
[154:01.45]Guy on the diving board.
[154:02.41]Just... I... I... Alright, that's it.
[154:06.97]And then I'm taking off the plane.
[154:10.61]Um...
[154:13.17]No, I can't.
[154:14.65]I gotta get out of this.
[154:30.43]Block hole.
[154:32.91]No, I'm out.
[154:33.65]I'm out.
[154:33.99]I'm out.
[154:34.31]I'm done.
[154:37.87]Like, honey mustard can... I'll do it another time.
[154:41.44]I'm done.
[154:41.92]I'm done.
[154:42.24]I can take off the plane.
[154:43.58]I don't even have a gun?
[154:52.08]I'm feeling, uh...
[155:15.25]How do you not have a gun?
[155:16.63]He does.
[155:17.01]I did it!
[155:44.55]N.A.
[155:44.69]Aim.
[155:44.83]What do you mean N.A.
[155:46.76]Aim?
[155:48.16]That's like 3,000 meters away.
[155:50.60]What are you talking about?
[155:52.18]A lucrative opportunity.
[156:03.20]Got it.
[156:03.48]Let's see what I unlocked here.
[156:08.67]The bad boy.
[156:09.47]The tyrant.
[156:10.71]Confidence artist.
[156:11.63]USB.
[156:14.51]There's so much cool stuff.
[156:19.96]Great source of potassium.
[156:23.70]No pain, no gain.
[156:24.64]32,000 experience points.
[156:27.74]Looking good.
[156:29.32]That's probably good enough for like a two, three star rating.
[156:34.41]Here's a 40.
[156:35.01]41.
[156:38.21]That's a lot of experience.
[156:44.82]Alright, looking for a rating.
[156:54.56]Zero.
[157:06.22]No, that doesn't work like that.
[157:09.40]That only happens when a restaurant doesn't have... A restaurant needs like three ratings on Yelp to get a star.
[157:15.79]I haven't played three levels yet.
[157:16.81]That's the problem.
[157:20.91]Whatever.
[157:26.21]Reached Haven Island level six.
[157:28.60]I can stash in the laundry room.
[157:32.06]Restaurant storage room.
[157:34.72]I can get a pirate saber.
[157:39.31]We can start at the shark hut.
[157:41.11]Shark hut?
[157:44.07]Remote gas device.
[157:45.79]Mission stories.
[157:46.63]Completing a mission is just the beginning.
[157:47.81]They're meant to be played more than once.
[157:49.64]Multiple plots to uncover.
[157:51.00]Carriages known and unlocked during once you get the overall story, the last result will make me that you complete the following missions.
[157:56.08]The water horse.
[157:58.38]Ooh.
[158:00.36]Let's do this one right now.
[158:03.88]The water horse.
[158:15.43]Uh, conceal.
[158:16.15]We'll just do the, uh, the chrome one.
[158:19.56]Take the pirate sword.
[158:21.90]What is this?
[158:22.48]Just screw?
[158:38.21]Compulsive pen.
[158:40.97]Oh, the duck.
[158:41.99]Frag.
[158:42.27]Let's take the, okay, grenade.
[158:45.37]Concealed weapon.
[158:46.29]That's fine.
[158:48.88]Take the duck.
[158:50.68]Explosive.
[158:51.48]Remote concussion collected.
[158:53.08]The pale duck.
[158:56.40]Alright, let's do it.
[159:00.31]Duck or riot.
[159:01.15]I got it.
[159:02.51]I got the duck.
[159:07.95]So what is this?
[159:09.11]This is another mission in the same area.
[159:19.76]The Haven Island staff is ready to receive you under your assumed identity as Tobias Reaper.
[159:25.02]Yeah, I know that.
[159:25.74]A professional thief looking to retire from a life of crime.
[159:29.02]It's the same mission, but... Ludmilla Vitrova can be found in the public sections of the island.
[159:34.81]Yeah, I know this.
[159:35.35]Primarily tending to client needs.
[159:40.01]Alright, so what about that other guy?
[159:41.71]When they're...
[159:59.22]It's a snowball.
[160:00.38]It's not gonna knock anybody out.
[160:03.44]Did I have it in the freezer?
[160:04.62]Holy fuck, that thing's crazy.
[160:29.72]Alright, exit to... Hold on a second.
[160:31.08]What's, um... I thought I had, like, another mission to do.
[160:39.68]Campaign.
[160:41.56]Sniper is at the... Okay, hold on.
[160:44.64]Yeah, right here, right?
[160:51.16]This is the campaign.
[160:54.94]Briefing the last resort.
[160:57.48]No, no, no, no, no.
[161:01.79]Challenges?
[161:03.01]Mission stories.
[161:03.83]Here we go.
[161:05.65]Take a deep breath.
[161:06.51]Follow this one.
[161:12.65]The shape changer.
[161:13.51]Follow.
[161:14.73]And the water horse.
[161:15.48]Follow.
[161:15.92]Okay.
[161:17.84]So, I'm following the water horse.
[161:21.90]I can only follow... Okay.
[161:22.90]Take a deep breath.
[161:23.52]This is like a doctor.
[161:26.36]Oh, it's just a different path with different lore.
[161:28.16]I see.
[161:28.52]Okay.
[161:30.75]Should I do the doctor or the jet ski?
[161:42.69]Horse?
[161:43.55]Horse?
[161:43.97]Okay.
[161:44.15]Let me see what it does.
[161:50.72]There's also stuff to do in this one, too.
[161:52.00]Aren't there, like, other little things to try?
[161:54.06]Like, yeah, there's, like, contracts, too.
[161:56.14]This is the last time I'm gonna play this game.
[162:03.09]Alright, let me get my weapons back the way they were.
[162:07.40]Hitman is done.
[162:08.02]How about the shark hut?
[162:13.02]We'll start there.
[162:14.76]This was the final DLC, right?
[162:16.43]They're not doing any more for Hitman 2, right?
[162:18.69]That's what I kind of took out of that whole thing.
[162:22.00]Alright, I'm going to take this thing.
[162:23.72]It just looks dangerous.
[162:25.38]And then I will take a... I'll take the duck.
[162:30.42]Everyone take duck.
[162:31.54]Let's go for duck.
[162:33.40]I fucked it up already.
[162:36.37]He already screwed it up, so... Is there one more expansion?
[162:41.43]I was under the assumption that this was the last one.
[162:47.83]Alright, let's go.
[162:52.73]Hitman 3 is coming.
[163:04.38]Alright, let's do it.
[163:07.32]New mission story.
[163:08.14]I'm going to do the doctor.
[163:10.80]Blood money is good too.
[163:11.68]Yeah, they're all good.
[163:13.54]Absolution is the only real... It was alright.
[163:17.72]It was kind of a different game.
[163:19.42]Doctor.
[163:19.86]Doctor.
[163:22.68]See you and your, um, assistant in the pool bar later on.
[163:30.36]Wonderful, Doctor.
[163:31.75]I'm sure Mr. Williams appreciates your visit.
[163:34.67]See you and your, um, assistant in the pool bar later on, perhaps.
[163:39.31]Okay.
[163:47.38]Mr. Reaper, is it not?
[163:48.94]Welcome to Ha- Thank you.
[163:50.58]Are you one of the owners?
[163:52.51]Yes, indeed.
[163:53.93]I'm Ludmila Vitrova, co-owner of Haven, and your gracious host for this day.
[163:59.61]I suspect we'll be seeing more of each other today.
[164:01.55]Oh, I'm sure of that, Miss Vitrova.
[164:05.13]Hey, buddy, this area's off limits.
[164:06.83]Your late booking has me intrigued.
[164:09.43]In the meantime, our staff will take good care of your needs.
[164:11.81]Don't let the grass grow under your feet.
[164:13.77]Get moving.
[164:14.81]Come find me when you're ready, Mr. Reaper.
[164:16.57]I think we have lots to talk about.
[164:18.99]If you don't move now, we're gonna have a problem.
[164:23.47]Okay.
[164:24.97]We'll see you... I'll see you around.
[164:28.59]Vitrova, can you do something?
[164:32.73]Can you please do something about this?
[164:35.33]What the fuck?!
[164:35.77]I needed to talk to you.
[164:36.45]Apparently.
[164:56.91]I don't want to do it.
[164:58.11]How do I put it?
[164:58.57]How do I stop?
[164:59.83]What's the... No, she's dead.
[165:14.13]Okay.
[165:14.77]I... Where's the doctor?
[165:18.85]I want to know why.
[165:21.37]I was talking... Is that the scope?
[165:33.36]Damn it, where is he?
[165:34.66]The Joker's some kind of ghost.
[165:37.31]Watch your head!
[165:40.49]This guy's a... Game is right on!
[165:45.15]Don't let him get away!
[165:46.55]Copy.
[166:16.81]Put the duck in the bath.
[166:19.89]What the hell is going on up there?
[166:21.35]Help me!
[166:25.37]Basketball coach!
[166:26.97]Coach, I need help over here!
[166:28.53]There's a psycho!
[166:30.80]We need help.
[166:41.40]I thought you ran.
[166:42.34]Alright, you're fine.
[166:50.34]I think there's a fire over there.
[166:52.66]Hold on a minute.
[166:55.59]There's a fire.
[166:56.73]There's a fire.
[167:00.10]Why did that happen?
[167:02.70]There was no reason for any of that to happen.
[167:06.09]The guy freaked out and started talking shit.
[167:08.37]Talking shit.
[167:09.99]Alright, was I trespassing?
[167:17.51]So I'm trespassing.
[167:18.29]I'm having a conversation with somebody who owns the entire resort.
[167:21.25]And I'm trespassing.
[167:31.86]You know, there needs to be an insanity meter on the right side of the screen.
[167:42.59]That was probably like a two-thirds full insanity meter.
[167:48.29]Oh, the doctor.
[167:49.13]Right.
[167:52.63]So I gotta get in there and... Let's listen in.
[168:00.24]I didn't even get the intel.
[168:36.53]What are you made out of, gremlins?
[168:39.20]What happened there?
[168:49.75]Okay.
[168:50.49]Here we go.
[168:51.93]Thank you, doctor.
[168:53.73]Fantastic work.
[169:05.56]My brain is insane.
[169:06.38]I thought there was a car on the minimap.
[169:07.98]Yeah, he did.
[169:08.98]I'm here now.
[169:10.32]It's amazing.
[169:12.00]He's apparently got to do his doctor thing here, meet up with some patient called Tyson Williams over at this big villa on the other end of the island.
[169:19.45]On the other end of the island.
[169:21.45]I can't believe I'm saying that.
[169:23.63]Tyson Williams has summoned a doctor to the island.
[169:26.78]He must be feeling under the weather.
[169:28.88]You have some experience with pain relief 47.
[169:32.68]Maybe you could be of assistance?
[169:35.71]So nice here.
[169:37.07]Me?
[169:37.13]Oh, I'm just gonna chill in the sun, drinking mimosas until I pass out.
[170:04.97]The person on the line is like, yeah, um, did it... Are you in the middle of doing it?
[170:11.31]Did you... Shit, I couldn't grab him.
[170:29.98]You know what?
[170:30.42]Fuck it.
[170:30.74]Watch this.
[170:36.53]No.
[170:37.17]I need to make it.
[170:37.75]Who the fuck is looking at me?
[170:42.93]What?
[170:43.33]Oh my god.
[171:03.06]He was pretending to shoot me with the gun, yes.
[171:05.40]Okay.
[171:34.00]The plan still stays the same.
[171:48.87]Plus 2% insanity.
[171:50.46]That was not insanity.
[171:51.58]That was me being seen by the guy from behind.
[172:00.03]Here we go.
[172:01.05]I had an opportunity there.
[172:02.03]I'm gonna make this really, really easy.
[172:03.81]I fucking didn't even let them do...
[172:29.75]The fucking story.
[172:31.39]To give you the intel.
[172:32.64]To progress it.
[172:34.58]I'm a fucking imbecile.
[173:01.36]Somebody said you're worse than the new Twitch font.
[173:06.14]Easy.
[173:07.56]Those are fighting words.
[173:10.00]Okay.
[173:11.94]I don't know.
[173:12.92]Where are you?
[173:13.78]You're here.
[173:14.30]Great.
[173:14.58]It's amazing.
[173:15.76]Doctor.
[173:16.22]Meet up with the patient.
[173:19.21]Tyson Williams.
[173:20.21]There he is somewhere.
[173:21.41]Okay.
[173:30.24]What are you doing here guys?
[173:32.80]I'm really you notice.
[173:34.14]I listen this is I swear to God what happened was I Fucking pressed X instead of space because I'm just rushing through it.
[173:44.38]I pressed X I climb up instead of like just fall down God damn it.
[173:51.01]I'm so sorry
[173:59.62]This is the last time this is going to happen.
[174:00.92]Oh, I'm getting texted.
[174:09.15]I'm getting texts.
[174:10.43]Who is it?
[174:18.85]Just making sure everything is all set to go.
[174:20.37]See you and your assistant in the pool bar later on.
[174:28.31]You can get levels from the first Hitman?
[174:30.53]What do you mean?
[174:32.79]Don't fuck this up.
[174:35.21]Do not fuck it up.
[174:37.21]Stay right here.
[174:38.15]Don't touch anything.
[174:38.99]And I'm saving it.
[174:39.77]Got it.
[174:58.57]We never have to see that again.
[175:31.16]This is a hard crash too.
[175:34.12]The whole thing turns off.
[175:39.54]Shit.
[175:42.58]God damn it.
[175:43.08]Okay.
[175:45.51]I want to play this mission.
[175:48.07]Please.
[175:55.05]Wait.
[175:55.35]Is this a patch?
[175:58.27]I'm downloading a patch right now.
[176:00.82]For Hitman 2.
[176:03.72]I think I just got crash booted out to download a hotfix.
[176:14.41]Or is this a cloud?
[176:15.67]Yeah, this is the cloud sync.
[176:17.57]Oh.
[176:20.39]Okay.
[176:21.03]Well, that makes sense then.
[176:31.04]Hitman 3.
[176:33.58]Ugh.
[176:34.50]By the way, I've had that Jerma 985 squashed into like 4 feet tall image on the right monitor the whole time.
[176:43.88]I just can't.
[176:44.54]I haven't alt-tabbed and closed it.
[176:45.80]It's still over there.
[176:51.86]Was I just destined to not play this mission?
[176:54.78]This kind of story here?
[176:55.54]I think it's possible.
[176:59.59]Show it.
[176:59.91]I don't need to show it.
[177:00.58]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[177:02.54]I could be describing 500 different pictures, by the way.
[177:15.85]No we don't.
[177:16.39]No we don't.
[177:16.89]No we don't.
[177:18.59]Yes you do.
[177:19.35]Yes you do.
[177:22.19]Do the challenge instead of the story mission.
[177:24.13]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[177:26.31]So let's go to... We have escalation... Is it game modes?
[177:33.76]No, no.
[177:34.10]This is... Wait, no.
[177:36.20]Destinations.
[177:36.96]Okay, let's go to... Heaven Island.
[177:41.72]And then challenges.
[177:48.02]The last... Made the last resort.
[177:50.34]So I just... I pick one of these?
[177:57.29]Aren't there other missions inside of these, though?
[178:00.69]Or is this the... I remember the other ones had... Other stuff.
[178:08.95]Is it escalations?
[178:09.73]What the hell is this?
[178:26.28]No.
[178:28.74]Sniper assassin.
[178:29.78]New content.
[178:30.34]Haven Island.
[178:30.88]No, I already have it.
[178:33.98]Is this just different targets?
[178:35.37]Yeah, I thought there was... I remember from the base game.
[178:39.89]Contracts.
[178:43.29]Trending.
[178:50.24]Elusive target.
[178:51.10]The captain.
[178:56.06]Should we go for the captain?
[178:56.70]Captain?
[179:05.40]Let's try it.
[179:06.72]Good morning, 47.
[179:07.18]Your target is Rutherford, a captain who works at Haven Resort.
[179:10.04]The owner, Tyson Williams, has contacted us that he wants Rutherford dead for causing many accidents at the resort, including sinking boats.
[179:21.45]Okay.
[179:31.38]Just... Yeah, why does... Why can't you just fire him?
[179:38.05]That doesn't... I don't understand.
[179:39.93]Flash phone?
[179:40.73]What does this do?
[179:46.47]Ooh, that sounds cool.
[179:49.12]Alright, let's get him.
[179:52.82]Captain Rutherford.
[179:55.80]Rutherford?
[179:56.96]Rutherford?
[179:57.50]Alright.
[180:08.62]Eliminate Captain Rutherford.
[180:16.95]So you can make a contract with this guy.
[180:23.53]That's pretty cool.
[180:27.77]Eliminate the captain.
[180:29.19]Alright, the captain's in here.
[180:31.57]Upstairs.
[180:34.67]I wonder how difficult this is going to be.
[180:36.90]Do I just go in there and just poison him?
[180:43.14]This is not gonna be this easy, is it?
[180:47.24]I think I just did it.
[180:47.96]I win.
[180:48.36]I think, right?
[180:49.02]Fuck, it's not that easy.
[181:15.29]So I just have to dump the guy and... Listen to the story.
[181:22.07]Okay.
[181:22.63]Is there an actual story?
[181:28.38]They're all easy if you do it like this.
[181:30.18]Alright, let's go.
[181:49.93]So I'm going to tail him for a little while.
[181:51.75]See what he does.
[181:58.74]He's up here.
[182:00.16]Drinking.
[182:07.39]Comes out here.
[182:10.57]This way.
[182:11.27]And then we're going to listen to what he has to say.
[182:15.44]Treasure.
[182:15.82]That means it's probably a treasure Easter egg on the island.
[182:19.54]Right?
[182:19.78]I would think so.
[182:21.68]Back off a little, buddy.
[182:22.94]You're starting to freak me out.
[182:53.39]Does he only stay up here?
[182:56.53]Hey, buddy.
[183:00.27]Well, it's poison.
[183:07.81]It's the easiest thing.
[183:10.47]Well, at least the one that's the most untrespassing, I know.
[183:16.77]Does he go anywhere else?
[183:18.61]Okay, guys.
[183:19.99]Quit screwing around here, okay?
[183:28.74]He doesn't look like a person.
[183:30.24]He doesn't look like a person to me.
[183:33.98]You know Gordon Ramsay's show when he puts on a bunch of masks and makeup and stuff and pretends to be somebody in the restaurant?
[183:39.98]That's what it looks like.
[183:41.78]The black almond's treasure will be mine soon enough.
[183:44.90]Scourge of the seven seas.
[183:46.66]The killer of men.
[183:47.90]The eater of babies.
[183:50.42]She buried her treasure on
[183:53.33]This guy's doing undercover boss right now.
[183:58.45]Alright, so very easily we found out here.
[184:02.95]But can I be like, come here.
[184:06.29]Come sit with me.
[184:07.71]I don't think so.
[184:09.47]Alright, so I need to make a distraction.
[184:12.29]This guy only does this.
[184:14.01]So we have to make a huge distraction.
[184:16.89]Call.
[184:18.07]I can use the phone?
[184:19.03]What?
[184:23.82]We're not doing that.
[184:48.39]Okay, what about rubber duck?
[184:51.75]And, alright, here's my plan.
[184:54.63]No, I don't have the rubber duck anymore.
[184:57.83]So what if I just... What if I just flash him in the eyes?
[184:59.91]Shit.
[185:03.62]Goddammit.
[185:25.57]What am I thinking?
[185:26.37]I could easily... Well, the phone's probably ruined.
[185:31.99]No.
[185:32.19]Can I throw it that high?
[185:38.04]I don't want to be in view of this guy.
[185:44.76]Got him.
[185:45.76]Here we go.
[185:47.26]Let's get up there.
[185:55.02]What the fuck was that?! !
[186:20.65]I thought it was gonna- I thought it was gonna be like a little men in black thing.
[186:25.65]Just like a- right in his eyes.
[186:37.79]Oh my god.
[186:38.91]That was a fucking nuclear bomb.
[186:58.89]holy shit that was too that was like just unexpected completely what the fuck I never like there was no reason why that was gonna happen in my mind you thought that scared you
[187:22.66]Fuck.
[187:25.24]Is that what that thing's supposed to do?
[187:27.10]No way.
[187:31.99]What is that thing supposed to do?
[187:33.31]He wasn't even knocked down.
[187:38.17]That guy is a real, a real fucking... Wait a minute, hold on.
[187:42.88]I...
[187:50.23]I can't.
[187:51.53]Okay.
[187:52.29]So, there actually is a treasure map.
[187:54.21]Just in case anyone... I want to find the treasure.
[187:56.66]So, I'm just going to say I don't care.
[187:58.00]I mean... Alright.
[188:09.13]Pick it up.
[188:14.59]Pick it up.
[188:22.61]It's not gonna do it again, right?
[188:23.57]I wanna see this from a distance.
[188:35.30]I'm very far away.
[188:36.32]That was not... That was not as ridiculous.
[188:55.66]I didn't think it was some kind of device!
[189:08.59]Yeah, some kind of device.
[189:09.75]I want that... I want that treasure map.
[189:22.78]I guess it's... Everyone's kind of... Oh, that... Everyone ran away.
[189:26.16]I think I can get him over here now.
[189:29.95]This guy looks... What are you doing?
[189:34.21]What?
[189:34.41]What's he doing?
[189:35.93]What is he doing?
[189:39.09]Are you alright?
[189:40.27]Yeah.
[189:41.01]I'm awesome.
[189:52.51]Yes.
[189:56.43]Ah.
[189:58.05]I think he's grabbing.
[189:58.97]I think he's losing his mind.
[190:02.07]That's the way to do it.
[190:03.24]I like it.
[190:03.82]That's the way.
[190:04.42]I'm not sure what the way is.
[190:06.62]I'm awesome.
[190:08.46]Are you trying to shake with shaking hands?
[190:09.94]I'm awesome.
[190:14.92]Yes.
[190:15.22]I don't think he's going to move.
[190:18.82]Ah.
[190:20.62]Catching.
[190:24.50]That's the way to do it.
[190:25.42]We weren't going to get out of that.
[190:34.04]I just want to... I just want to know... Alright, that's it.
[190:49.26]That's it.
[190:51.75]That's it.
[190:54.40]Game over.
[190:56.22]Check it.
[190:57.58]Mm-mm.
[191:01.16]Got just about enough of this.
[191:10.83]Oh, yeah.
[191:11.37]We ain't gonna do anything.
[191:12.27]We're gonna go right.
[191:13.69]We're just going right for the kill.
[191:34.13]Who's looking at me?
[191:39.87]What?
[191:52.96]Oh, okay.
[191:56.09]You can kill somebody with the starfish?
[192:09.94]now let's go
[192:44.34]I got killed with a starfish.
[192:47.04]Wait, seriously?
[192:49.06]You can actually do that?
[192:50.30]Why is it a knife?
[192:55.22]Why is a starfish a knife?
[192:59.35]What?
[193:00.29]This makes no sense.
[193:04.47]Okay, I got the treasure map.
[193:05.75]No, stop.
[193:05.91]Oh my god, I can't...
[193:15.19]It's my treasure, not yours.

[193:50.55]For the love of God.
[194:06.84]Watch this.

[195:26.12]This guy's all the way out here looking for me.

[197:47.22]What?
[197:47.87]Somebody come pick it up.
[197:49.17]This just got serious.

[198:10.98]Alright, I did it.
[198:14.16]I did it.
[198:15.68]I don't have to do this one anymore.
[198:40.14]Is there any more sniper missions to do?
[198:42.64]What about the treasure?
[198:43.46]Who cares?
[198:45.71]Three new unique targets, new gameplay, and 20 new mastery levels.
[198:48.35]Okay.
[198:58.48]Go back here.
[199:00.40]What about this one?
[199:01.48]Is there anything else that I could do here?
[199:03.78]This one was crazy.
[199:06.18]You know, that's probably... Let me look at this just once more.
[199:34.63]We're probably pretty close to the end here.
[199:35.81]I just want to make sure I do the things... Wait, what is this?
[199:41.04]Object... Wait, this is in New York.
[199:46.50]Eliminate using electrocution.
[199:53.34]What?
[200:05.81]What the hell am I dressed as?
[200:07.93]What?
[200:13.22]I don't want to be in this costume.
[200:15.66]I have to eliminate Erna Seamans by electrocution.
[200:24.82]I don't have any items.
[200:28.44]So it's a game of sneaking around.
[200:30.16]Alright, you got it.
[200:31.24]Sure, don't even need to sneak around.
[200:36.57]I tried to throw it Do I have to stay in this disguise?
[200:45.53]Oh
[201:08.09]Alright, this time I'm not gonna be a fucking idiot.
[201:14.81]You gotta be kidding me.
[201:18.00]Electrocute the guy, grab some stuff.
[201:19.46]I have to stay here so people are gonna see everything.
[201:21.72]What?
[201:22.18]I'm gonna go car to car here.
[201:30.03]Go.
[201:36.80]Hammer, I'll take it.
[201:38.94]Wait, battery.
[201:44.60]I need that battery.
[201:59.64]You can't save it.
[202:02.65]Oh, no.
[202:07.73]This is gonna be hard.
[202:08.67]Oh, shit.
[202:14.81]Okay.
[202:15.69]Everybody can see through.
[202:17.45]So, I'm gonna... Oh, God.
[202:19.36]Somebody's coming.
[202:26.52]I can't... Yeah, no.
[202:27.36]I can't save scum.
[202:29.20]That's a disaster.
[202:34.69]Here we go, I'm gonna have to do this.
[202:37.45]Bingo, let's go.
[202:43.70]What?
[202:44.62]The camera.
[202:46.28]Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
[202:54.57]Give him all you got.
[202:55.95]I'm really sorry.
[203:05.44]Holy shit, this is really, really hard.
[203:11.23]Do I have to avoid everything?
[203:16.73]Shit.
[203:17.03]I don't think I'm gonna do this one.
[203:18.83]This is too escalated for me.
[203:25.11]I need to get a carrot?
[203:31.00]Yeah, this might be too escalated for me.
[203:33.39]No safes coming?
[203:34.99]Oh.
[203:36.19]Don't know if I'll be able to do this.
[203:37.41]Alright, I can get to here.
[203:41.09]Can't go this way, so I have to go up this way.
[203:42.45]Alright, slow down.
[203:48.99]I got... That person does not see through my disguise.
[203:54.53]Or is it just trying to load?
[203:55.95]What?
[203:56.48]I need, um...
[204:00.22]Uh-oh.
[204:01.26]Put this down.
[204:04.77]Alright, I can turn that box off.
[204:07.43]And then... God damn it!
[204:21.38]What?
[204:21.66]Oh, fuck.
[204:22.42]I can't go to... I can't leave.
[204:24.16]Where is he?
[204:33.44]How many people coming out?
[204:34.16]Okay.
[204:36.55]Get out.
[204:37.31]That's fine.
[204:38.25]Bang left.
[204:40.95]Who's in here?
[204:42.61]Oh my god.
[204:44.29]Can I do this?
[204:45.19]It's weird that a guy's a rabbit right now, right?
[204:47.55]Is it weird?
[204:48.87]That's a little weird, right?
[204:50.50]That's a little weird.
[204:52.20]Coin.
[204:55.24]That's a little weird.
[204:56.52]Is it...
[205:18.44]I can't go over here How the hell am I supposed to get this way?
[205:30.51]To the left, I think.
[205:31.77]And then to the... Oh!
[205:33.17]There's the manager.
[205:36.69]I don't know.
[205:37.77]I have no idea.
[205:38.79]I don't know.
[205:43.19]Is there everywhere?
[205:44.73]There's nowhere to go.
[205:45.27]I have to throw a coin for this guy.
[205:47.92]Alright, I'm gonna try it.
[205:48.50]I'm gonna throw a coin.
[205:49.84]We go one, two, three...
[205:59.49]Whoa!
[205:59.95]Oh fuck.
[206:24.89]Um, okay, then.
[206:32.75]Oh my fucking god!
[206:35.51]Oh my fucking god, oh my god, oh my god, what do I do?
[206:37.85]What do I do about this?
[206:39.39]I don't have anything.
[206:40.17]What do I do?
[206:41.96]What do I do?
[206:43.02]What do I do?
[206:43.42]What do I do?
[206:43.76]What do I do?
[206:44.08]Somebody help me, what do I do?
[206:46.10]What do I do?
[206:46.80]Vault?
[206:46.96]I can't drop.
[206:57.27]No, this is wrong.
[207:04.82]Shit.
[207:18.49]Throw something?
[207:19.43]I only have the car battery.
[207:20.77]I don't have anything else to throw.
[207:21.79]There's nothing else to throw.
[207:41.81]Throw this at him?
[207:42.53]No, I have to electrocute the guy downstairs.
[207:44.21]I have to electrocute the... I'm right there.
[207:50.07]Should I punch him in the face and then run downstairs?
[208:00.05]Punch and run.
[208:01.15]Punch and run.
[208:01.75]Punch and run.
[208:02.53]Punch him and then run.
[208:03.96]Punch him and run?
[208:04.80]I'm gonna punch him and run.
[208:05.76]I'm gonna think that's what I'm gonna try to do.
[208:07.34]Throw battery to space.
[208:08.18]Can I use the battery?
[208:08.72]Wait.
[208:09.08]Important.
[208:09.40]Can I use the battery again?
[208:13.77]Try going right after I vault.
[208:15.21]I'll try it.
[208:35.06]Check this shit out.
[208:42.64]I need that battery.
[208:43.36]I need the battery.
[208:59.33]Oh, right out of the camera's view.
[209:01.03]Get the fuck out of here.
[209:05.79]Battery.
[209:22.82]Save?
[209:23.16]There is no saving.
[209:24.02]I can't save it.
[209:24.98]Alright, so if I just overhand throw this at the guy...
[209:29.36]Will it electrocute him?
[209:39.13]No.
[209:40.29]How do I do this?
[209:44.21]Just throw it in the water?
[209:45.25]Okay, I'm gonna throw it into the water.
[209:49.57]That's a water, right?
[209:52.68]That's hitting the water currently.
[209:55.80]Correct?
[209:56.00]Is it a shadow?
[209:56.40]I have to leave now.
[209:56.84]Where's there an exit?
[209:58.20]Oh, come on.
[209:58.80]Don't even... I have to get to the exit.
[210:01.44]I only have one exit.
[210:25.21]Wait, how do I get out of here?
[210:26.69]I'm taking the gun.
[210:28.43]Where's his gun?
[210:50.35]Where is it?
[210:50.67]I just have to run out the door.
[210:52.71]Okay, alright, easy, easy, easy.
[211:01.80]Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, right there.
[211:11.90]Oh, clean.
[211:12.82]I did it clean.
[211:14.28]Very clean.
[211:15.90]See you later.
[211:20.93]That was hard.
[211:21.41]That was fun, though.
[211:27.28]Come on, give me two or three stars.
[211:28.28]Come on.
[211:33.33]Someone could hurt themselves.
[211:34.21]There's even more to do here.
[211:38.25]I guess technically not.
[211:41.41]We did it.
[211:44.40]Start with the standard loadout.
[211:45.66]Electrician with the bank robber disguise.
[211:48.70]Very cool.
[211:50.36]Three stars.
[211:50.92]I'll take it.
[211:52.18]So you just do it faster?
[211:53.34]Is that how you get higher stars?
[212:01.24]So what's the next one?
[212:01.76]Yeah, you just gotta go faster.
[212:08.17]Let's look at the details.
[212:11.65]Fresh disguise.
[212:12.41]Silent takedown.
[212:13.93]Unnoticed.
[212:16.63]Never spotted.
[212:17.37]No noticed kills.
[212:18.59]No recordings at all.
[212:19.79]Non-target kill.
[212:21.94]How would you get the cop away without making them both get up?
[212:30.58]You know what I mean?
[212:32.85]Seems hard to do that with a coin.
[212:34.43]But wouldn't they both stand up?
[212:37.19]Alright, we got another one.
[212:38.59]If any non-targets are eliminated, you will immediately fail the mission.
[212:41.99]I have to retrieve the burial dagger.
[212:45.75]I have to kill these two with the burial dagger.
[212:50.75]Oh, no.
[212:52.37]And electrocution.
[212:56.23]Holy shit.
[212:56.73]Yeah, that's not possible.
[213:04.99]I don't think I can do that one.
[213:10.68]So here's Elusive Target.
[213:11.82]This is interesting.
[213:12.68]Good afternoon, 47.
[213:13.64]Your target is Etta Davis, also known as the Angel of Death.
[213:20.17]The target is a retired nurse believed to have killed dozens of patients in retirement homes and hospitals across Great Britain.
[213:27.23]Okay.
[213:27.81]Her preferred technique is poison, though in later years, she's begun to prefer blunt weapons and violent accidents such as falls.
[213:36.01]Like you.
[213:36.44]I can only have one chance?
[213:38.56]I can only do this one time?
[213:39.76]Oh no, that's not good.
[213:40.62]One chance.
[213:41.28]Planning.
[213:41.62]Do I get to plan anything?
[213:42.76]I do.
[213:42.98]Alright, let's do the...
[214:06.68]Let's take the silver baller.
[214:07.78]I'm going to stay in the regular suit.
[214:13.45]Barber wire I never use.
[214:16.47]Small gold bar.
[214:19.79]Interesting.
[214:20.37]I'll try it.
[214:23.83]Coins.
[214:27.18]Okay.
[214:27.98]I'm going to pee before this because I only get one chance.
[214:34.05]Yeah, it's piss time.
[214:36.05]It's been like almost four hours and it's time to pee.
[214:39.07]See you guys in a minute.
[216:02.90]Thank you.
[217:24.91]Howdy.
[217:27.27]So this is going to go very, very poorly, I assume.
[217:29.73]Because it's been... It's been like six months or so.
[217:35.80]Or four or five months since I've been even on this map.
[217:38.94]So...
[217:41.22]No idea.
[217:44.98]We'll find out.
[217:48.65]Alright, let's go.
[217:51.71]This contract is an elusive target.
[217:53.11]When playing an elusive target, the following rules apply.
[217:55.91]You must begin the contract before the countdown expires.
[217:59.80]If you die, you can't retry.
[218:02.04]If you completed the contract and successfully exited, you may not retry it.
[218:07.40]Right.
[218:08.08]Okay.
[218:09.92]You can't restart the contract.
[218:11.34]You cannot save your game.
[218:12.54]The contract briefing may contain additional fail conditions.
[218:19.52]Start the timer now.
[218:20.28]Because... I think it's a win for me if I last five minutes.
[218:29.79]Five minutes from right now, if I'm still in this mission, then I win.
[218:40.85]Good afternoon, 47.
[218:42.70]We have been unable to determine the target's specific location.
[218:46.24]Now it's too loud.
[218:48.66]It's like way too loud.
[218:51.42]It's super loud now.
[218:52.98]I can't even imagine what that explosion was like.
[218:55.92]No tea.
[218:56.76]It must have been so awful.
[218:57.64]Alright, so we've got...
[219:11.18]Where is she?
[219:13.76]In regards to the map itself.
[219:16.88]Let's find out.
[219:17.42]Oh my god, where are you?
[219:26.49]I don't even know where she is.
[219:27.25]Oh my god, this is going to be hard.
[219:30.57]Alright, we need intel.
[219:40.07]She's right there?
[219:42.07]Okay.
[219:48.61]Area discovered.
[219:49.45]Brick!
[219:55.26]Don't pick up the brick.
[219:56.20]Okay.
[219:56.94]What is... This is a...
[220:12.19]Okay, I can get up there.
[220:15.73]Not allowed up there, guaranteed.
[220:17.03]Hello.
[220:24.62]I definitely can't go this way, right?
[220:28.30]They're gonna be like, stop!
[220:30.48]Yeah.
[220:31.74]Alright, let's go this way.
[220:34.86]I'm assuming I can probably break somebody in an alleyway.
[220:37.20]Oh, screwdriver.
[220:40.63]That takes care of that.
[220:42.81]And a wrench.
[220:44.35]Good to have.
[220:46.53]Cause an oil leak here.
[220:54.60]When I approached Jerma... Anyway, really, Jerma... Something about Jerma didn't submit at TwitchCon.
[220:59.42]Alright.
[220:59.90]Nothing to wait.
[221:01.10]Kitchen?
[221:13.79]No.
[221:15.49]I gotta... Let's go.
[221:16.91]I need to bring somebody in the alley here.
[221:22.40]I'm so paranoid because if I do anything wrong, it's over.
[221:33.41]There's so many people that could just get an accidental wrench.
[221:44.95]Market Square... Where the hell are you?
[221:58.66]No, put that down.
[222:03.50]I gotta get a military costume.
[222:11.63]Oh yeah, isn't there film crew?
[222:13.91]Is there no intel on this either?
[222:16.67]I don't get any intel.
[222:18.13]No intel.
[222:38.02]I don't know where the hell she's going to be.
[222:45.77]Because I can go in here.
[222:49.44]She's not up there.
[222:50.18]I remember there was a guy up there.
[222:51.54]He's a different person though.
[222:55.88]Hmm.
[223:06.97]She's not over here.
[223:07.70]Maybe I have to do something to get her out.
[223:10.70]I dunno.
[223:23.73]Where is this lady?
[223:26.59]Is she blending in too?
[223:32.40]She's not showing up red!
[223:41.27]Alright.
[223:44.09]Here's a military costume right here.
[223:52.75]Let's see if I can get it.
[223:53.75]Alright.
[223:55.70]I want you to come over here.
[223:56.92]Ooh.
[223:59.52]Okay.
[224:00.42]Examine the printing schedule?
[224:03.44]Intel.
[224:05.54]No Intel.
[224:08.24]God damn it.
[224:11.58]We got a raid.
[224:12.52]We got a raid from Roboz.
[224:14.62]Just came in.
[224:16.18]Thanks a lot, Roboz.
[224:18.94]Welcome, everybody.
[224:20.80]We're currently doing Hitman 2 DLC.
[224:23.67]Although this is not... I don't think this is even DLC.
[224:25.75]We're just kind of cleaning up Hitman 2.
[224:29.33]Hope you had a good stream.
[224:30.11]I don't know what you're playing, but... What were you playing?
[224:38.30]Was it a good game?
[224:42.32]Alright, I gotta throw something over here.
[224:45.01]Noita.
[224:45.79]Oh, okay.
[224:47.19]Is that game good?
[224:47.73]A lot of people have been playing that game.
[224:49.49]It looked interesting.
[224:52.03]Alright, here's my chance.
[224:53.51]Brick.
[224:57.30]Son of a... Calm down, it's serious.
[225:11.33]Calm the area.
[225:16.55]Fuck.
[225:17.69]How did you guys hear that from beyond the wall?
[225:27.65]They don't even see him over here.
[225:32.47]Damn it.
[225:34.71]Killed?
[225:38.26]They're gonna wake him up.
[225:43.00]I have an opportunity and I have to take it.
[225:44.38]I'm going for it.
[225:45.12]I'm going for an opportunity.
[225:46.28]And I'm going for 3, 2, 1.
[225:48.15]Go for it.
[225:50.03]Here we go.
[225:50.79]Check it out.
[225:51.31]Watch this one.
[225:52.33]3, 2, 1.
[225:54.31]I'm fucking bad.
[225:55.17]I'm bad at the game.
[225:55.93]I had it.
[226:00.04]I'm fine.
[226:19.10]Man, I have nothing to report from my current location.
[226:20.92]What the fuck is that noise?
[226:22.20]Man, I have nothing to report from my current location.
[226:34.63]Is somebody running a generator over here?
[226:36.31]What the hell are you doing?
[226:41.41]Let go of me.
[227:04.97]That guy was making a lot of noise.
[227:06.49]Alright.
[227:12.63]I now- Oh, god damn it, man.
[227:15.95]Will you please?
[227:30.12]Alright!
[227:30.90]Any more actors like to come out of stage left?
[227:33.42]Any more actors?
[227:34.20]How many?
[227:59.34]Hey, what happened over here?
[228:01.97]God damn it, I lost.
[228:03.09]There's no way I'm gonna do this.
[228:12.23]I don't even know what she is!
[228:14.21]She's not even in the game!
[228:15.23]She didn't even logged in yet!
[228:18.04]This is ridiculous!
[228:43.77]I can restart.
[228:52.08]Holy shit.
[228:54.38]I thought I could only do this once.
[228:57.46]So where is this lady then?
[228:59.42]I'm so confused.
[229:01.52]We can't... We don't know where she is.
[229:04.28]City center.
[229:05.06]Alright, the city center.
[229:06.64]Yeah.
[229:06.84]Wasn't I just in the city center?
[229:08.42]Just don't die.
[229:09.05]Oh, alright.
[229:09.31]Easy.
[229:09.43]Alright, city center.
[229:10.47]Hi there.
[229:10.77]Yeah, hi.
[229:31.44]Market Square.
[229:32.16]Consulate Square.
[229:40.76]So, is she just in here?
[229:45.87]What does she look like?
[229:52.43]I'm looking for, like, an old lady.
[229:56.13]Sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you're a little close to me.
[230:10.70]Electronic street.
[230:14.72]So where's the city center?
[230:23.43]I'm just waiting for her to cross paths.
[230:40.12]This is probably the city center, right?
[230:42.06]Like, right in here?
[230:42.86]Market Square?
[230:48.03]Consulate Square?
[230:48.87]I mean, I would say that would be the city center.
[230:58.07]This is city center.
[230:59.65]Take a look at this shit., This is the center of the city, if I've ever seen the city center of anything in my life.
[231:12.14]This is the market.
[231:13.56]So is this the city center?
[231:40.55]She's not like sitting up here or something, right?
[231:47.97]She's just sitting up on the roof somewhere.
[231:58.92]Identify yourself!
[232:04.80]That's enough!
[232:10.40]I ended up in the same exact place I was last time.
[232:22.57]Okay, so she was in the city center a few hours ago, but good luck.
[232:35.46]Where the fuck is she?
[232:39.72]That doesn't help me.
[232:41.52]Why the hell wouldn't you say she's in the market?
[232:43.62]I remember this.
[232:44.62]I'm just gonna go in the middle of the market and just literally walk around in a circle.
[233:19.73]This is... This is Where's Waldo.
[233:26.13]Is that what the whole point of this?
[233:34.36]This is Where's Waldo, but I don't get to see every single person at once on a piece of paper.
[233:39.44]I have to walk around.
[233:41.02]In the image.
[233:48.18]What the hell did you just say?
[233:53.75]Stop talking.
[233:56.45]Stop talking.
[233:57.31]Somebody said something here.
[233:58.29]What did she say, though?
[234:02.17]You haven't seen the news?
[234:03.41]Never.
[234:05.04]You know.
[234:17.58]I heard rooftops.
[234:23.26]Okay.
[234:23.58]There she is!
[234:26.81]That's her right there, isn't it?
[234:30.93]No.
[234:33.39]Get the fuck away from me!
[234:35.09]How do I get on the roof?
[234:40.92]And just like in Where's Waldo, instead of a guy with a white and red striped shirt and the hat on, there's somebody with like a red and white pinstripe shirt on.
[234:50.85]Not the horizontal.
[234:52.25]It ain't Waldo.
[234:56.33]How do I get on the roof from here?
[234:58.29]Alright.
[234:59.74]Roof.
[235:01.72]How do I get on the roof?
[235:05.00]Anybody?
[235:06.58]Anybody at all?
[235:11.28]Just fly there.
[235:12.18]How do I get up this... Roof access.
[235:21.27]I need roof access.
[235:28.41]It's not up there.
[235:30.41]It's like... Where?
[235:32.43]Can I climb this?
[235:36.96]The stairs over here, but that just leads...
[235:47.31]I got it.
[235:47.69]There's stairs here.
[235:51.36]Okay.
[235:52.18]Distraction time.
[235:54.96]Where is this on the map so I can remember where this is?
[235:56.72]Okay.
[235:57.06]So it's right by the vase street.
[236:00.63]Here we go.
[236:01.21]Distraction time.
[236:02.09]Soda.
[236:07.05]Fucking stupid motherfucker.
[236:24.83]Guys, very clearly I am... There she is!
[236:32.04]There she is!
[237:08.97]What is she doing up here?
[237:10.01]Okay, I can get her.
[237:16.59]Vase Street.
[237:17.52]You got it.
[237:18.74]Vase Street.
[237:19.98]Just bang it.
[237:20.76]She's right here.
[237:21.54]Mm-hmm.
[237:21.68]No, I won't.
[237:37.11]So, what time did he give us again?
[237:40.29]Sorry sir, I can't let you through.
[237:42.05]Sir, you are not authorized to be here.
[237:43.75]He's gone.
[237:50.71]He's gone.
[237:51.81]He's gone.
[237:56.91]Do something!
[238:01.15]Target eliminated.
[238:03.54]The money has been wired to your account.
[238:12.64]Oh, fuck!
[238:13.38]He's... Guys, I can't restart the mission.
[238:17.61]I have to leave.
[238:18.19]Oh no, this is very bad.
[238:21.77]Oh no, this is very bad.
[238:46.55]No, I did it.
[238:47.33]It's okay.
[238:48.21]If I didn't miss the first... I panicked.
[238:51.23]There's nobody up there with her.
[239:01.65]I went like left, right.
[239:05.33]God, that feels so... I feel so drained.
[239:08.37]I feel so unaccomplished right now.
[239:17.92]It's grayed out, too.
[239:18.97]And I did it, but it's... I didn't do it.
[239:25.91]I thought there were going to be, like, three or four people up there with her, but there wasn't.
[239:28.65]They were downstairs, and they followed me up that last time.
[239:30.61]I thought they were already up there.
[239:31.59]It's alright.
[239:35.62]That was still fun.
[239:40.66]Anything else going on?
[239:42.12]Sniper assassin.
[239:43.00]Did I already do this?
[239:48.04]Did I do this?
[239:48.56]I did this one.
[239:49.54]What's this one?
[239:50.84]This is new.
[239:55.06]This is a multiplayer?
[239:56.76]Alright, this is a sniper mission?
[240:18.26]Hitman Multiplayer Rage.
[240:19.68]I remember that.
[240:20.28]I was so angry.
[240:21.97]I was having such a good time on that stream too, and it just... I just... I'm so upset.
[240:46.39]So I got a sword?
[240:48.19]Free targets.
[241:12.85]The three are in Singapore to secure Mr. and Mrs. Ledong, who have been smuggled from the U.S.
[241:17.88]in a shipping container.
[241:19.92]The Ledongs are expected to be transported back to Kandanyang for a public execution to celebrate the birthday of the country's dictator, Sun Po.
[241:29.41]I have no idea how to use the sniper rifle.
[241:31.49]They're gonna run over there and try to kill the hostages?
[241:33.75]Is this Counter-Strike 1.6?
[241:34.33]Am I playing with a Griefer?
[241:34.99]I don't understand.
[242:06.75]Okay.
[242:07.45]One, two, three.
[242:09.65]Hostages must survive and get rid of all the bodyguards.
[242:13.14]This is going to be impossible for me.
[242:16.60]Come on.
[242:16.84]I don't know about that.
[242:18.46]I've got the level.
[242:19.12]I don't have any upgrades.
[242:22.90]I have the default rifle.
[242:24.12]I don't have anything else cool.
[242:28.70]Alright.
[242:33.38]Fuck it.
[242:33.62]Let's go.
[242:35.90]How do you zoom in?
[242:45.14]47, this is... No, Diana, this is 47.
[242:48.61]How do you zoom in the sniper rifle?
[242:51.19]I haven't used this one before.
[243:03.03]That was a civilian.
[243:15.56]Alright.
[243:16.08]We're looking for... Right here.
[243:17.06]Okay.
[243:17.18]And here.
[243:17.50]The blade.
[243:20.84]Okay.
[243:44.70]And then we've also got up here... He's coming down the stairs.
[243:51.10]Okay, get rid of as many bodyguards as I can.
[243:53.70]So where's the... The action is here.
[243:55.56]Alright, I gotta make a plan here.
[243:56.92]Shift is breathe.
[243:57.42]I'm gonna wait till they all get down in the same area.
[244:14.22]I can go for it right now.
[244:18.88]That's moving.
[244:19.46]That's hard.
[244:20.56]Now she's moving.
[244:21.74]Just take the shot.
[244:22.36]Take it.
[244:22.66]Take it!
[244:22.92]I did it!
[244:23.56]I win!
[245:03.35]No.
[245:03.69]God damn it.
[245:08.75]Shit.
[245:11.59]Oh, come on.
[245:13.15]Are they still... They're alive, right?
[245:18.54]Oh, he's going... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[245:23.68]He's going to go kill them.
[245:32.04]Oh my god.
[245:32.68]I need to toggle.
[245:34.58]I'm a toggle guy.
[245:38.82]Right now holding down right mouse button is hurting me.
[245:52.32]Oh!
[245:53.69]That was pretty damn good.
[245:56.47]That guy's on the toilet.
[245:57.99]No.
[245:58.49]Refrain.
[245:59.25]Refrain.
[245:59.63]Refrain.
[245:59.89]You can't.
[246:24.16]Felt pretty damn good to me.
[246:37.19]Get him.
[246:39.03]Get him.
[246:42.57]Right in his face.
[246:47.50]How many people do I have to shoot?
[246:48.84]Right in the head.
[246:56.62]All of them.
[247:09.56]You bastard!
[247:11.06]Get over-
[247:20.52]Got it.
[247:20.88]That was fun.
[247:21.70]Running in circles is the only way to avoid it.
[247:24.09]Yeah, you just have... That's it?
[247:26.17]I didn't do anything fun.
[247:46.97]I did nothing fun.
[247:49.38]I just shot people with the sniper rifle.
[247:51.64]I didn't get anything fun.
[248:05.87]That was just a tablet gamer.
[248:11.69]I like the sniper rifle.
[248:13.05]It's cool.
[248:15.14]How is that a tablet gamer?
[248:17.86]There we go.
[248:18.28]It's because, see, I needed to unlock this stuff.
[248:19.82]I got an extended mag.
[248:21.52]Flared magwell.
[248:23.69]Reduces reload time.
[248:24.75]See what I'm saying?
[248:25.29]Alright, let's go back to replay and mission.
[248:30.19]Actually, you know what?
[248:31.43]Yeah.
[248:32.33]Go back to the menu.
[248:34.01]I want to do the next one.
[248:38.68]There is an iPhone game that's made for this.
[248:40.44]No, I know.
[248:41.08]I've played it.
[248:44.35]I also three-starred every single level in Hitman Go.
[248:47.42]Kind of a good achievement, I think, if you ask me.
[248:52.96]And then there's Siberia.
[248:53.94]I just want to see them first.
[248:59.21]I'm going to replay them.
[249:04.07]So these two are DLC.
[249:06.27]So my stream is not a live.
[249:19.93]Welcome to Siberia 47.
[249:22.05]I could do something cool in this one instead of just headshot people Your destination is the privately owned perm 14 prison facility located near the freezing Siberian tundra Here you're tasked with the elimination of Vitaly Reznikov Try to kill somebody with an app and Roman Capco renowned Russian mobster with suspected political ties.
[249:48.05]I
[249:49.84]Might be possible.
[249:50.94]Looks like a swole golem.
[249:52.38]Kinda does.
[250:15.09]A string of recent news articles has exposed violence and even murder as everyday occurrences in Perm 14.
[250:22.60]Our client suspects that Capco's release could cause serious diplomatic issues.
[250:28.06]Both targets must be eliminated, along with Reznikov's mercenary guards.
[250:31.68]Does the cold mess with how I shoot the gun?
[250:34.31]Note that the prison's regular guards are not sanctioned targets.
[250:38.59]So I can't just shoot people.
[250:39.67]Eliminate the Warden, Roman, and then the Siberian Tigers.
[250:41.37]Mission is now active.
[251:09.17]Nice.

[251:25.97]Okay.
[251:31.45]cause a riot, and then eliminate as many members of the mercenary death squad as possible.
[251:37.27]So these are the two targets.

[253:35.78]And up here is the warden.
[253:38.46]Okay.
[253:39.64]So if there needs to be a riot in here, how do I cause a riot in here?
[253:49.99]Probably shoot one of these things?

[253:53.13]Hold on.
[253:54.77]He's just hanging out in there.
[254:01.43]Warden stays up there.

[254:06.23]What about on the other side?
[254:10.71]Anything interesting over here?
[254:14.07]I think I can just get this guy.
[254:16.32]I think I'm just going to get this guy.
[254:18.28]No one's around.
[254:18.72]Right?
[254:18.84]Okay.
[254:37.40]Nobody else around here?
[254:43.03]Did anybody see that?
[254:48.60]Okay.
[254:50.42]I gotta get a... Hmm.
[254:55.70]All the way down there, he's gonna see somebody, right?
[254:57.71]Where is this dude?
[254:58.33]Coming up from the bottom.
[255:03.13]Will he see this?

[255:04.16]Oh, fuck.
[255:04.52]Wait a minute.
[255:04.94]What's that?
[255:05.24]What does this thing do?
[255:06.64]Shoot the faucet.
[255:08.02]I'm gonna shoot the faucet.
[255:34.55]I didn't want to see that.
[255:43.87]I didn't want to see that.
[255:44.59]That was going to be horrible.
[255:49.55]Ah, my stomach.
[255:51.33]Too late.
[255:59.18]Last try.
[255:59.86]Last try.
[256:00.30]And I'm going to go and start the ride immediately.
[256:05.30]Save the guy.
[256:11.77]You killed an old man with a starfish.
[256:14.43]That was different circumstances, though.
[256:20.05]Alright, when he starts to do that... Wait, hold on a second here.
[256:27.38]Wait a minute.
[256:29.90]When he... He's gonna... He'll electrocute himself.
[256:34.43]He'll die.
[256:36.91]This is going to spray water over here, and he's going to slam this down, and he's going to die.
[256:43.29]Right?
[256:47.70]I would assume that would happen.
[256:50.92]So I shoot this during the craziness, and then just let him do it.
[256:56.00]I'm going to try it.
[257:10.35]Let's just keep an eye on it.
[257:12.98]Why is there another prisoner over here?
[257:17.82]I could just get him right in the shoulder.
[257:22.28]Imagine this guy pushes down and starts choking him, walks out, and it's a guy with a bald head.
[257:32.83]What?
[257:35.91]I can shoot that?
[257:39.69]I'm waiting for it.
[257:43.57]Because that's interesting.
[257:44.49]Here we go.
[257:44.77]Alright.
[257:46.01]Press X to change bullet type.
[257:49.81]Wall-piercing ammo.
[257:50.51]Shockwave ammo.
[257:51.63]Boom.
[257:51.89]Okay, here we go.
[258:19.90]Here we go.
[258:28.68]That didn't do what we thought it was gonna do.
[258:35.20]Wait a minute!
[258:40.58]Oh.
[258:53.94]Fuck.
[258:55.32]Wait, wait, where is he?
[258:57.06]Where is he?
[258:57.38]Wait, wait.
[258:57.70]Oh, where is he?
[258:59.20]He's on the move, huh?
[259:01.88]I did it.
[259:02.54]I did it.
[259:03.38]Wait, wait, there's people.
[259:15.91]Oh, fuck.
[259:21.53]No, shoot this guy.
[259:30.11]What?
[259:32.52]Oh, come on.
[259:45.33]Where's he going?
[259:45.79]Where's he going?
[259:46.13]Where's he going?
[259:49.95]What the fuck was that?
[260:03.39]I'm getting shot at.
[260:04.09]I'm getting shot at.
[260:04.55]Where are they?
[260:08.45]Shit.
[260:08.63]God.
[260:17.80]Fuck.
[260:18.22]Damn it.
[260:19.32]I just got a collateral.
[260:32.89]Where's his head?
[260:45.39]God.
[260:50.26]Shut up.
[260:50.62]I don't see you down here.
[260:58.84]That's the last target eliminated.
[261:00.52]Good work as always, 47.
[261:02.86]The riot should cover our tracks perfectly.
[261:05.70]I'll wire the money as per usual.
[261:08.70]I don't know.
[261:10.12]The water barrel may have sprayed him.
[261:16.43]Just wait till I get those points for the electrocution.
[261:22.15]Really?
[261:24.01]There's an animal in this somewhere.
[261:33.06]Oh, shoot.
[261:35.26]Shoot it when it's in his hands.
[261:39.10]Oh, OK.
[261:43.94]Extended magazine.
[261:46.10]Let's do it again.
[261:53.51]Let's try.
[261:53.77]Okay, I'm going to try.
[261:54.31]I've got to cause a riot, too.
[261:55.25]Let's see what happens when I do this.
[261:56.71]I mean, this is a riot right here, right?
[261:59.25]I mean, just open the door.
[262:00.11]Good.
[262:20.45]47, the situation is about to become critical.
[262:28.30]47, targets are evacuating.
[262:29.88]Secure any remaining primaries now.
[262:35.88]47, the warden is on the move.
[262:37.52]He's heading for an exit.
[262:40.53]I did not see that coming, 47.
[262:42.81]Well done.
[262:46.85]Oh yeah, feels good.
[262:51.91]I dropped it on his head.
[262:52.80]Wait, where's the other guy?
[262:53.42]I gotta get him in the head.
[262:59.38]Where's he going?
[263:04.19]Where is he going?
[263:07.84]Straight to hell.
[263:19.84]Alright, no more slow motion, we're doing it straight up.
[263:22.59]Check this out, straight up.
[263:54.06]My DPI is so bad.
[263:55.66]I have to move my hand like ten times when I zoom in that far.
[264:23.98]What?
[264:24.36]I just dropped icicles on somebody.
[264:26.44]Alright, I can do something cool for this guy.
[264:41.10]Something cool.
[264:41.90]We got electrocution right here.
[264:46.78]He's gonna turn and... No, he didn't.
[264:51.48]He went the other way.
[264:54.99]I'm gonna... How did he die from that?
[265:02.94]Okay, that was odd.
[265:05.56]Open the door.
[265:07.26]What's behind the door?
[265:17.75]Something else.
[265:18.18]Something else cool.
[265:18.78]Something else cool to do.
[265:29.40]Two more.
[265:36.27]Got it.
[265:36.73]Didn't even need to zoom in.
[265:39.21]Last one.
[265:39.77]Right here.
[265:40.01]I'm going to make it cool.
[265:41.35]Something interesting.
[265:42.09]Something funny.
[265:42.75]Something funny.
[265:43.67]Something fun.
[265:45.09]He's going all the way up.
[265:49.52]I guess I could do that.
[265:50.20]No, it's not going to do anything.
[265:55.02]No, there's nothing in the way.
[265:56.68]I just have to shoot him.
[266:07.21]That was really funny, that last one.
[266:08.37]So what is the animal one?
[266:09.03]Is it duck?
[266:39.72]Alright, let's go back.
[266:45.88]I want to do... What's the first one?
[266:54.70]Actual Where's Waldo?
[266:55.66]Yeah, but that's not Where's Waldo because it just tells you where they are.
[267:01.25]Oh, this is that... I remember this one.
[267:03.47]Alright, I'm going to do something cool for this one.
[267:08.06]I believe last time I did this as well, it was... I just shot at everybody and that was it.
[267:28.36]Like all the other game modes.
[267:30.74]I don't use weapons in regular Hitman.
[267:31.88]Very rarely do I shoot off a round.
[267:33.27]Okay, this one.
[267:33.87]This is the demo level, yeah.
[267:35.05]Yeah, this one released a year and a half ago.
[267:57.50]I know how it works.
[268:17.79]No one's going to be concerned about this.
[268:24.62]Dorian Lang is confirmed killed.
[268:27.33]47, the situation is about to get out of hand.
[268:32.01]Just like I did last time.

[271:31.03]Oh no, what have I done?

[272:49.35]The Hitman 2.
[272:52.08]Good afternoon, 47.
[272:55.85]How much is this game and is it worth it?
[272:57.43]Hitman and Hitman 2, respectively, are some of the most fun video games you could ever buy.
[273:03.85]Absolutely.
[273:07.54]There's a never-ending amount of content in both of these games.
[273:11.72]How much is it, though?
[273:12.42]I think it's 60.
[273:13.36]Is it an ad?
[273:13.80]No, it's not an ad.
[273:14.22]It's an opinion.
[273:27.02]All opinions are not ads.
[273:42.05]I mean, I didn't know that was over there.
[273:45.85]Alright, we're gonna wait for something to happen.

[278:41.89]Yeah, he's up.
[278:42.61]He made it.
[278:43.43]No, he didn't.
[278:45.82]I have to let it happen.
[278:47.20]I didn't get anything for the cake.
[279:02.72]How did I not get this for the cake?
[279:04.54]Exploding cake is not an achievement.
[279:10.54]Alright, I'm gonna do it the way I'm gonna do it.
[279:13.44]He's dancing, and you gotta get it right when he's dancing.
[279:16.68]Last one.
[279:17.04]Alright, we can just hit here.
[279:29.09]I'm not gonna zoom in.
[279:31.24]Zooming in is admitting that it's time for you to fire.
[279:43.34]I've never seen what this ceremony looks like.
[280:00.45]I just want to watch the ceremony.
[280:04.23]From a distance.
[280:04.91]God, they take a while.
[280:27.68]It's usually at about this point right now where I lose patience and just start firing at the targets.
[280:32.86]Hasn't happened yet, so that's a good sign.
[280:37.06]Run out the 15 minute timer and don't do anything.
[280:43.62]Am I getting nervous?
[280:53.06]That is Guillaume Maison, the Kingfisher.
[280:56.40]Former Interpol agent and the owner of the mansion and its grounds.
[281:03.64]Okay, I'm good.
[281:04.72]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[281:07.73]I'm good.
[281:09.41]Alright, I'm fine.
[281:10.15]Everything's good to go.
[281:10.89]I was a lot of resisting there.
[281:35.11]Is that Jim Carrey in the Dumb and Dumber suit?
[281:50.96]Alright, everybody, they're over there.
[281:54.57]So here comes the ceremony.
[281:55.63]They don't even... That's a really, really long walk the daughter down the hall.
[282:04.20]They went from the car.
[282:05.26]That was almost a full five straight minutes and people would... They're just gonna go.
[282:11.30]Alright, I... Does anybody even know the wedding's happening?
[282:32.82]Oh, congratulations.
[282:33.64]Okay.
[282:35.26]Nice job.
[282:40.05]I was fired.
[282:40.67]That just, like, that... Just, that was an immediate response.
[282:44.61]It was like duck hunt, fly in the air, shoot thing in the air.
[282:48.76]That was almost seriously a, like, just a... Almost like an animalistic response.
[282:53.50]Like, thing, get thing.
[282:59.44]Okay, here comes the... During the dance.
[283:03.90]They're all going up to the reception.
[283:04.94]That was a really short ceremony.
[283:18.76]So where is he going?
[283:19.46]That way?
[283:20.80]Inside.
[283:21.40]Where's the bride?
[283:22.64]Don't you take pictures?
[283:38.88]Alright, here we go.
[283:40.56]Time for the toast and then the father-daughter dance.
[284:00.92]The guy, the butler, whatever, he's got to go over the railing.
[284:03.18]Nope.
[284:17.56]10 minutes remaining.
[284:19.42]Sure.
[284:20.04]Whatever.
[284:20.32]There's an achievement to do this during... Alright, wait.
[284:34.77]Are they all going to stand in the same place?
[284:36.31]Can I just do a shockwave right into the ground?
[284:42.88]It's like I'm playing Quake.
[284:49.05]Is the dad also the priest?
[284:50.69]I'm confused.
[285:02.59]That was a pretty great... Wait.
[285:04.66]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[285:06.94]You're about to be spotted.
[285:08.94]Lang is down.
[285:10.12]Nice work, 47.
[285:14.44]47, an alarm went off.
[285:15.50]They're evacuating.
[285:21.79]47, Guillaume Maison is attempting an evacuation.
[285:24.95]Stop him.
[285:32.97]Doris Lee is down.
[285:35.87]Maison is confirmed killed.
[285:38.09]Well done, 47.
[285:38.73]That guy sees me.
[285:40.59]That guy can see me.
[285:43.94]He's the only guy.
[285:45.28]Your only hope is about to get eliminated.
[285:58.64]Oh no, not the maze!
[286:01.46]We're stuck in the maze.
[286:06.24]Terrible bodyguard.
[286:07.66]That guy was standing still.
[286:16.45]Oh, you asshole.
[286:30.75]Stop doing that.
[286:31.76]Toggle.
[286:38.10]You fucking idiot.
[286:41.86]I've shot that guy every single time.
[286:46.55]I've replayed this mission four or five times.
[286:48.33]That guy dies every single attempt.
[287:06.64]What?
[287:10.48]That guy fell.
[287:11.56]I didn't shoot that guy.
[287:12.20]That guy fell down.
[287:16.46]God damn it.
[287:19.16]Who the fuck are you?
[287:22.10]What?
[287:22.52]Who is this guy?
[287:23.29]He was holding binoculars.
[287:27.67]That means he was a threat.
[287:29.81]He could see me.
[287:31.33]He could tell everybody where I am.
[287:39.64]The money will be wired to your account in a moment.
[287:46.00]I didn't get to see the dance.
[287:51.59]I didn't get to see the dance.
[288:05.09]I just want to see this.
[288:07.76]I'm impatient.
[288:08.46]Well, the guy had the binoculars and he freaked me out.
[288:10.60]I thought he was going to see me.
[288:20.23]This game is so much fun.
[288:26.01]I can't do it.
[288:26.79]Am I actually going to do this another time?
[288:34.67]I'm not even going to zoom in.
[288:39.13]I'm just going to sit here.
[288:46.23]Read a book for six minutes to distract yourself.
[288:48.77]I don't have a book.
[288:52.17]I don't have any book or anything here to do that with.
[288:56.39]What's this?
[288:56.77]Alright, I'm going to read the Guy Fieri Minute to Win It for the Connect guidebook.
[289:15.45]Okay.
[289:19.33]So now, here we go.
[289:23.97]Play as if you were a minute to win it contestant.
[289:27.63]You will play ten games and succeed at each challenge in less than one minute.
[289:32.91]Cool.
[289:34.35]Interesting stuff.
[289:36.27]The goal is to win ten games in order to earn one million dollars.
[289:42.15]When you do not succeed in a challenge, you lose a life.
[289:45.55]That's not good.
[289:47.05]If you have no more lives, you fail.
[289:49.31]You only have three lives, so be careful.
[289:52.07]If you succeed in a challenge, you will earn money and will be able to choose between continuing to the next level or stopping and keeping the money.
[289:59.88]Nice.
[290:01.12]Pretty cool.
[290:06.20]If you decide to continue, you will play the next level and be able to earn more money, but be careful.
[290:12.46]If you fail, you will lose all the money you have earned during the TV program unless you have reached some bank stages.
[290:22.63]A thousand, fifty thousand, or two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
[290:29.79]For example, if you fail after having reached the fifty thousand dollar stage, you will earn fifty thousand dollars.
[290:37.18]That's interesting.
[290:40.47]The player has, in the supermarket aspect of the game... No, this is terrible.
[290:50.36]That's just not an interesting thing to read.
[291:01.66]I don't have anything.
[291:02.84]I don't have this much stuff in this room.
[291:06.60]Not as much.
[291:08.10]You know, at the same time.
[291:10.27]This doesn't make any sense.
[291:11.03]I don't have any books.
[291:13.51]I don't own a book.
[291:19.75]Truly.
[291:26.74]Keep reading it.
[291:27.44]No, I... I don't own a book.
[291:31.94]Where are we at?
[291:34.48]Almost halfway there.
[291:37.04]I missed the dance.
[291:37.88]No, I did not miss the dance.
[291:40.10]The dance happens way, way later.
[291:45.28]Just read chat?
[291:46.14]Yeah, I mean, that's kind of what I'm doing.
[291:54.78]What was the last book that I purchased?
[292:01.34]Uh, probably... A Song of Ice and Fire.
[292:05.76]A Dance of Dragons.
[292:08.68]It might be the last book that I purchased.
[292:12.50]Who would win in a fight?
[292:13.44]You or a drunk you?
[292:15.90]Me.
[292:25.36]Face cam your mouse for this.
[292:27.40]I'm not going to face cam my mouse.
[292:31.38]A Song of Ice and Fire is now normie tier.
[292:36.14]I'm going to put my hand up and get called on in the class.
[292:39.44]I read that book 10 years ago.
[292:41.78]So, I read that before the show even was like a fucking thing.
[292:47.17]You understand?
[292:49.75]I read that book.
[292:50.71]I read those books before the show even aired.
[292:53.09]What are you going to say now?
[293:11.72]It's my favorite TV show right now.
[293:15.06]I don't really have a favorite TV show.
[293:18.80]I sporadically watch random shit.
[293:30.29]Like?
[293:31.57]Um... Hold on.
[293:34.17]Oh no, we're good.
[293:36.39]I don't know.
[293:36.91]I've seen... I've seen like three or four episodes of Mr. Robot...
[293:42.97]I watched the last season of Attack on Titan.
[293:47.52]It's my one anime per year.
[293:48.86]That's the one it's going to be.
[293:51.50]I've watched Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares for six or seven episodes.
[294:04.63]What else?
[294:05.29]Oh, Peter Popoff Miracle Spring Water infomercials.
[294:09.01]I watch them at least once every other night.
[294:12.40]Add that to the list.
[294:16.80]What else have I been watching lately?
[294:26.25]That's pretty much it.
[294:31.03]Are they dancing?
[294:33.07]What is he looking at?
[294:41.45]There's no reason to have binoculars out right now.
[294:43.55]What are you looking at?
[294:48.54]This wall?
[294:49.16]You're looking at the wall.
[294:50.88]You were just standing next to that wall.
[294:54.70]Looking for me.
[294:55.73]No.
[294:56.97]That happened last time.
[294:57.91]Alright, when's the dance?
[295:05.41]They're gonna be near the cake!
[295:08.55]They're right next to the cake!
[295:10.44]This is hard to do!
[295:12.28]They're right next to the cake!
[295:17.52]They're standing next to the cake!
[295:30.37]That looks like a good cake.
[295:31.19]You know what I really like?
[295:33.61]And I didn't even realize until I had it very recently.
[295:38.32]Banana cream pie.
[295:39.72]Holy shit.
[295:42.06]What an unbelievable S-tier dessert.
[295:45.02]If I could redo my desserts, banana cream pie would be at S+.
[295:52.30]There ain't anything better.
[295:56.82]I couldn't believe how the velvety texture of that banana custard and banana filling with that Cool Whip whipped cream on top.
[296:08.43]Crunchy crust.
[296:09.75]I hate pie.
[296:11.01]Pie sucks.
[296:13.77]But banana cream pie is like the best.
[296:16.93]I'll eat it every time.
[296:20.53]Are they going to dance yet or what?
[296:27.61]Chocolate cream pie, I thought, was my favorite pie.
[296:30.17]It's the only pie I ever wanted to eat.
[296:33.21]That's until I had banana cream pie.
[296:38.05]And you just don't know until you eat it.
[296:43.10]Imagine not liking key lime pie.
[296:44.78]Banana cream pie sits... If key lime pie and banana cream pie are next to each other, banana cream pie is on a ladder that is 3,000 feet tall.
[296:58.22]no keen line pie is not even close it's good it's not close and then I thought now remember I said this first anybody any other streamers that want to try to tell you that they came up with this they didn't I did
[297:24.66]A banana cream pie filled donut.
[297:30.79]I came up with that.
[297:33.35]If another streamer wants to tell you that they did, they did and I did.
[297:46.10]Where can I get one of those?
[297:50.10]How are you going to fit a pie into a donut?
[297:51.68]No, I'm saying like the banana cream filling in a donut.
[297:55.72]Like a chocolate cream, but it's a banana cream filling.
[298:06.47]No, no, no, no.
[298:08.35]I need the dance to happen.
[298:09.81]There's only five minutes.
[298:10.85]When are they going to dance?
[298:12.77]When is the dance?
[298:16.21]Trying to shoot the piano?
[298:17.15]No.
[298:17.77]Stop aiming at objects.
[298:22.37]Does this actually happen or was that just the thumbnail?
[298:27.25]Now I want a banana cream pie.
[298:28.99]What have I done?
[298:31.39]The bride left.
[298:32.57]Wait, the bride left?
[298:33.88]Nice try.
[298:34.42]This has to be it right here.
[298:35.20]Why are they all going upstairs?
[298:51.40]I'm looking for the dance, but they're all going up here.
[298:57.20]Oh, shit.
[298:58.32]Wait a minute.
[298:59.77]Hold on.
[299:00.21]I can get them all.
[299:02.05]I can get them alright now.
[299:02.99]I can get them alright now.
[299:14.58]Holy shit, but there's no dance.
[299:16.80]But there's...
[299:21.28]Why is it not falling?
[299:23.02]Why is it not falling?
[299:23.94]I waited so long for this.
[299:24.90]Why is it not falling?
[299:25.66]I got everybody.
[299:50.88]That was everybody.
[299:56.81]No, not that guy.
[300:02.63]Watch it.
[300:03.31]Watch it.
[300:06.11]There's so many people there.
[300:07.57]Just...
[300:26.14]We ain't never gonna see this dance.
[300:28.20]I almost just shot the bride.
[300:29.51]What a mistake that would have been.
[300:43.80]Who's shooting?
[300:56.94]Funny, funny!
[301:00.00]Oh, you blew the funny thing.
[301:03.08]You've disappointed everybody in the chat room.
[301:09.40]No, I want a banana cream pie so bad.
[301:11.35]Why does this always have to happen?
[301:13.73]Get out of here.
[301:28.47]Whoa!
[301:36.94]Well, I think I'll go down these stairs.
[301:40.30]I wonder what's going on at the wedding.
[301:42.03]I've been up here for about an hour and a half just thinking about stuff, contemplating.
[301:45.09]I wonder if it's free drinks.
[302:11.11]What?
[302:13.33]Why are they going up here?
[302:15.03]What are you doing up here?
[302:17.37]You walked, you went all the way up and now you're going, are you going all the way up?
[302:29.54]This is not how you leave.
[302:33.50]This is the top floor.
[302:50.73]I was running over there to get hit by that.
[302:54.35]There was no other reason.
[303:00.74]I don't know why that was there.
[303:05.62]That was so far up in the top left away from everybody.
[303:10.34]I feel like people were doing it like a drug up there.
[303:27.26]They're like breathing in the fumes from the air conditioner.
[303:31.47]Oh, the fire extinguisher.
[303:38.84]I'm never going to see this dance, am I?
[304:03.04]I can't.
[304:03.70]I can't do it again.
[304:04.60]I did it so many times.
[304:07.40]Let's... I want to see this one.
[304:08.46]I haven't seen this one.
[304:15.73]This one... There could be interesting things to do in this one, too.
[304:20.71]Reward yourself with banana cream pie?
[304:23.89]I will.
[304:26.17]Oh, tomorrow.
[304:26.64]If you guys want to know what we're doing tomorrow...
[304:31.26]I don't know what I'm thinking with this one, but a game came out recently that's been around for a long time from my understanding.
[304:40.35]It's called Numbers Go Up.
[304:43.59]Idle game.
[304:55.08]Yeah.
[304:56.96]And I just saw it, and there's a million upgrades, and it's like Cookie Clicker, but not.
[305:00.57]It's like Cookie Clicker 5.0.
[305:03.87]I'm playing that right now.
[305:05.25]Laugh Out Loud.
[305:12.01]It's been on a website for a while.
[305:13.55]It came out on Steam recently.
[305:14.83]You really phoned it in tomorrow.
[305:27.64]What?
[305:28.16]No, I just saw it.
[305:30.24]And it's a coloring book game too that I wanted to play.
[305:32.34]Look, tomorrow's stream is gonna be different.
[305:45.88]And then Friday we're gonna do the first community night.
[305:49.80]I also have Code Vein.
[305:50.98]I want to play Code Vein too.
[305:53.32]I don't know, we might do this all tomorrow.
[305:56.61]I also have the floor... I'm not even going to tell you.
[305:58.89]I'll keep everything, but I'll show you my whole poker hand.
[306:00.81]Alright, let's take a look around.
[306:09.55]Lots of weird generators and stuff.
[306:14.90]Meeting up here.
[306:15.92]Where's that meeting?
[306:17.30]Right here.
[306:26.75]Right.
[306:27.07]Right.
[306:27.89]I quaked them all.
[306:57.69]no no no no wait just wait wait a minute god I love this game oh just hitman just keep making hitmans do I have to wait for like another five minutes I do
[307:22.42]But yeah, so tomorrow we're going to try some random... There's an achievement to get one of these.
[307:26.82]I know because I saw it.
[307:44.50]Okay, I gotta wait.
[307:45.12]I need... What the fuck down here?
[307:46.28]There's a car.
[307:48.06]Oh, yeah.
[307:48.44]Yeah.
[307:49.33]I'm gonna drop a car on somebody.
[307:51.11]Absolutely.
[307:52.41]Guy in the toilet.
[307:53.87]Rubber ducky.
[307:54.71]Right?
[307:55.87]There's a rubber ducky scenario?
[307:58.10]I don't know.
[308:00.52]Do it now.
[308:00.96]Why would I do it now when this guy's just a mechanic?
[308:02.72]I'm not gonna do it.
[308:07.14]What else is over here?
[308:07.92]A lot of little random spots.
[308:14.20]I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[308:19.46]Is he drinking on the job?
[308:37.71]Back to work.
[308:45.31]Wait a minute.
[308:46.71]What?
[308:48.09]That was actually an achievement.
[308:49.15]Okay, yeah.
[308:51.25]No more happy hour.
[308:54.35]Oh, that's so funny.
[308:54.97]Alright, what are they doing over here?
[309:12.03]I also have the floor is lava.
[309:13.54]It's a parkour game.
[309:15.68]Where the floor is actually lava.
[309:17.68]And they have to avoid it.
[309:18.94]Seemed interesting.
[309:20.70]Maybe we'd play it.
[309:28.39]That looked interesting.
[309:29.47]Yeah, it did.
[309:30.23]It really did.
[309:44.95]He showed his whole poker deck.
[309:46.83]Oh, no, I did not.
[309:51.81]That's the best thing about playing poker.
[309:55.29]I've got two hands up my sleeves.
[309:57.49]You guys aren't even going to see them.
[310:12.47]Do they move them?
[310:13.25]I think they move them.
[310:17.23]Where are they moving them to?
[310:25.23]Are they not moving them?
[310:29.77]47, I'm seeing movement.
[310:31.75]Spider Lily is escorting the hostages towards the ship.
[310:37.77]So?
[310:39.35]This is an opportunity.
[310:40.72]I want to drop the car on somebody.
[310:43.06]That has to happen.
[310:54.16]You already played Goose Game?
[310:55.16]Yeah, I did.
[310:57.58]We did that before TwitchCon.
[311:00.99]This has something.
[311:01.59]This is a lock.
[311:08.69]Is he fighting?
[311:11.42]Careful.
[311:11.98]Careful.
[311:15.52]Stop!
[311:21.10]I got you.
[311:21.54]Don't worry.
[311:33.31]I mean, I could just go do a double right there, but that's not interesting.
[311:40.26]Hold on.
[311:40.72]Was he just seriously down here at the car?
[311:43.20]Did I miss that?
[311:44.86]No.
[311:51.74]He's gonna go to the toilet now, I think.
[311:55.53]Is he?
[311:58.15]No, he's going to this, like, weird... ...office?
[312:03.78]He's gonna drink out of the glass.
[312:04.76]Should I shoot the glass out of his hand?
[312:18.25]What?
[312:34.17]I just tried to Donkey Kong that guy and it didn't do anything.
[312:43.05]I thought it was gonna hit the stairs and roll down.
[312:47.27]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this.
[312:50.98]Ah, he didn't do it.
[313:00.12]Somebody go under that car.
[313:15.01]Will you go down?
[313:16.40]Go downstairs.
[313:17.84]47, they're beginning to suspect something.
[313:28.87]Where are the hostages running?
[313:37.81]Guys, don't just run.
[313:38.83]Do they not know?
[313:39.53]47, targets are evacuating.
[313:42.20]Secure any remaining primaries now.
[313:49.85]47, the blade is on the move.
[313:51.97]I think he's running for the hostages.
[313:53.67]Wait, what?
[313:54.03]Don't let him get to Ledong.
[313:56.45]He's running for the... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[314:01.70]How does he know where they are?
[314:02.60]We're good.
[314:27.24]Oh, I forgot.
[314:39.44]I forgot about that.
[314:40.34]Alright, alright, alright.
[314:41.76]This is actually the last one.
[314:44.09]This is it.
[314:46.23]We're doing this lightning fast, by the way.
[314:48.93]It's gonna be, like, insane how good this is.
[314:52.45]Here we go.
[314:52.87]Let's take a perimeter scan.
[314:54.71]Bingo.
[315:15.78]Who?
[315:15.94]Who could be fucking onto me?
[315:17.08]Why'd he take the sword out?
[315:21.94]He takes the sword out.
[315:22.60]What?
[315:23.26]I can't.
[315:44.73]Please!
[315:45.71]Just wait!
[315:46.39]Where did he go?
[315:52.19]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[315:57.27]Where is he?
[315:58.09]Where'd he go?
[316:04.52]Where is he?
[316:06.84]Where's the guy with the sword?
[316:10.52]Oh, he's dead.
[316:16.86]No, I'm done.
[316:17.88]I'm done.
[316:18.29]I'm done.
[316:18.71]I'm done.
[316:19.01]I'm done.
[316:19.35]I'm done.
[316:19.63]I'm gonna shoot the handcuffs off.
[316:24.25]Can you do that?
[316:25.44]This probably... I bet you there's an achievement to shoot off the handcuffs.
[316:45.64]There actually might be.
[316:46.76]I wouldn't be surprised.
[316:47.50]Okay, if shooting the guy's glass, his booze bottle, is an achievement, then... 47.
[316:58.58]One of the hostages died.
[317:01.30]The mission is over.
[317:19.16]No, I don't want to go here
[317:42.86]Alright, I think that's probably going to be it for Hitman here.
[317:47.26]Unless I want to do one more thing.
[317:48.88]Alright, this is going to be an absolute dickhead run.
[317:54.28]You ready?
[318:02.82]We call this one a shit for brains run.
[318:15.27]That's every run.
[318:16.13]No, it is not.
[318:18.11]I don't think you know what that means.
[318:23.95]Every run.
[318:24.33]That's not every run.
[318:26.84]I don't do this every run.
[318:28.24]I don't do what you're about to watch right now.
[318:50.30]Didn't work out the way that I thought it was gonna work out.
[318:56.95]Didn't work out the way that I thought it was gonna.
[319:12.54]That's not what I do normally.
[319:14.06]I don't even use a gun normally.
[319:15.46]I don't use a gun!
[319:33.33]Good.
[320:09.95]Should have brought the snowball.
[320:25.12]Just one more target to go.
[320:28.54]So, that's Steven Bradley taken care of.
[320:31.38]Well done.
[320:35.34]Why are they aiming at the TV?
[320:35.98]They're aiming at the television.
[320:40.46]Who the fuck are you?
[320:42.86]All clear.
[320:43.50]Jesus Christ.
[321:00.43]Let's go.
[321:06.46]Wait, iron.
[321:07.20]Good.
[321:07.84]Get some more weapons.
[321:35.58]Give me that gun.
[321:36.08]Give me the gun.
[321:43.36]That's a shotgun!
[321:46.30]Give me the shotgun.
[321:47.04]Give me the shotgun.
[321:48.16]Give me the shotgun.
[322:08.80]Where is he?
[322:09.54]He's all the way down.
[322:11.36]He's so far away.
[322:17.39]You're playing this like Hotline Miami.
[322:24.89]Wait, I remember this part.
[322:32.19]I just... I triggered the event to have it be thunder and lightning out.
[322:41.55]Shoot him through the window.
[322:53.95]Who?
[322:58.33]Just get out of here!
[323:10.05]Move!
[323:10.29]Whoa!
[323:11.09]I'm almost there.
[323:44.66]Uh... I... Um... Oh shit!
[323:56.15]I'm dead.
[323:56.63]I'm dead.
[324:00.63]What?
[324:01.54]What did he say?
[324:02.26]A drink for... Why was he do... I don't know.
[324:05.54]I have no idea.
[324:14.64]That's over.
[324:22.50]No, not one more time.
[324:28.16]No, that's it.
[324:29.42]Not one more time.
[324:32.66]One more time.
[324:33.24]Fine.
[324:35.60]Except I'm going to do it differently.
[324:36.42]I'm going to do it from behind.
[324:39.28]I'm going to go all the way to the back and then all the way forward.
[324:43.83]Go get the job at the bank.
[324:44.86]Oh yeah, I'll do that too.
[324:45.60]Alright, now we're out this way.
[325:13.76]There he is!
[325:23.71]That door is not open?
[325:25.65]How?
[325:30.61]What is this?
[325:31.07]A machine?
[325:31.67]Whoa!
[325:37.77]That's awesome.
[325:48.19]I pressed Q twice.
[325:52.43]Didn't work.
[325:52.79]I have no time for this.
[325:53.47]Alright, we're going to go around the back.
[326:09.68]Whoa, bros.
[326:10.18]What's this?
[326:10.56]A machine?
[326:11.26]Like if you think it is.
[326:12.34]Sub if you think it's not.
[326:21.86]That's so stupid.
[326:35.05]Get up here.
[326:35.55]I don't know.
[326:36.95]I like it down there.
[326:38.33]It's nice and cool.
[326:40.07]It's so hot up here.
[327:13.00]I'm done.
[327:33.00]I'm out.
[327:33.34]I gotta get out of here.
[327:34.24]I have to leave.
[327:36.00]I'm out.
[327:36.70]I'm out.
[327:36.98]I'm out.
[327:37.22]I'm out.
[327:37.48]I'm out.
[327:37.74]I'm out.
[327:38.04]I have to stop.
[327:39.70]That's it.
[327:40.02]I'm done.
[327:41.05]You can't just sprint through the mission.
[327:43.83]I've already beaten it like three times.
[327:45.57]That's it.
[327:45.89]I'm done.
[327:46.41]Game over.
[327:47.59]That's it.
[327:47.85]This is it.
[327:49.53]That's it.
[328:11.46]I didn't even get the person.
[328:12.88]I didn't even get the lady.
[328:15.90]Alright.
[328:20.32]That's it.
[328:20.68]That's actually it.
[328:22.41]That's for real.
[328:23.17]That's it.
[328:23.59]That's the end.
[328:25.35]That's it.
[328:27.39]I'm glad we don't have to talk to that Petrova woman anymore.
[328:30.33]Did you notice how clean she was last night?
[328:35.85]Portman could hardly get away from her.
[328:39.56]Oh, shit.
[328:40.00]Someone help me.
[328:42.94]That's it.
[328:59.11]That's it.
[329:01.25]That's it.
[329:01.71]I'm done.
[329:05.25]Thanks for watching Hitman 2, guys.
[329:06.67]I had a lot of fun.
[329:07.81]Game's fucking amazing.
[329:16.76]Wait!
[329:19.18]Wait.
[329:20.70]There's one more thing I have to do.
[329:34.55]I have to get the job.
[329:36.79]Because I knew I wanted to do that.
[329:39.09]I'm gonna go get the job.
[329:41.49]This is the New York Bank level.
[329:43.51]I need to go get the job.
[329:45.80]The job is a guy puking in a toilet over here somewhere.
[329:48.62]I don't remember where, but he's somewhere over here.
[329:50.34]Remember this joke from last time?
[329:56.67]We gotta see it one more time.
[329:59.33]Hey!
[330:02.87]Hey!
[330:03.31]Whoa, what the hell?
[330:05.33]Hold it right there.
[330:06.60]Don't move.
[330:08.82]Get him into your spikes and pull that trigger, Jess.
[330:10.98]Yeah.
[330:22.26]my fucking mind, guys.
[330:24.38]I'm losing my mind.
[330:33.41]Okay, to make this speed this up, direct me left or right or straight to get to the interview.
[330:46.42]Left.
[330:48.90]This way.
[330:57.59]Am I going the correct way?
[331:00.27]No.
[331:00.47]Okay.
[331:00.83]I'm going to go back.
[331:06.45]There's a mission story to guide you through it.
[331:10.92]Is there really?
[331:13.70]Okay.
[331:17.00]Alright.
[331:17.70]Mission story.
[331:19.18]The job interview.
[331:20.88]Alright.
[331:21.46]Now I'm ready.
[331:25.32]Yeah.
[331:26.50]Let's do it.
[331:31.85]The job interview.
[331:35.71]Disguise yourself as a job applicant.
[331:37.62]So I was going the right way.
[331:49.88]Excuse me.
[331:50.58]If you're coming through, I have to frisk you.
[331:52.97]Only take a minute, okay?
[331:56.09]Sure.
[331:56.53]Go ahead.
[331:58.19]Where did you just go?
[331:59.99]Thank you.
[332:00.55]I don't know what that is.
[332:08.66]I saw it on the ground.
[332:09.54]What?
[332:09.66]You just did.
[332:29.41]You just did it.
[332:31.49]Fine.
[332:31.71]Alright, this is it.
[332:34.94]Time to get the job.
[333:01.18]You're standing in the doorway, just blocking the door.
[333:03.32]Where'd you get that jacket?
[333:10.56]I like it.
[333:12.28]We got the similar taste.
[333:22.05]Okay, here we go.
[333:44.13]Have you forgotten how to open the door?
[333:47.07]Yeah Yes Why can I not save the game?
[334:13.30]Climb in through the hole.
[334:27.89]What's her problem?
[334:28.67]Does this person have the key?
[334:38.85]This person doesn't have the key.
[334:43.05]I need like a security guard to come in here.
[334:44.37]I don't know where that guy's going, but...
[335:13.16]Oh, I need a crowbar.
[335:14.40]Figured it out.
[335:16.29]Crowbar.
[335:16.69]Where's the crowbar?
[335:30.27]Here we go.
[335:39.92]There's still a few.
[335:51.61]Approach the reception.
[335:53.61]This is it.
[335:55.93]Why did the feathers come out of there?
[336:00.17]Alright, it's time.
[336:03.10]Right, I gotta play the part.
[336:05.10]Come on, man.
[336:17.70]It's me.
[336:18.38]You're talking to me.
[336:19.08]I'm the person that's supposed to be here.
[336:21.22]It's me.
[336:21.42]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[336:49.97]They just made fun of me.
[336:51.37]To my face.
[336:51.89]Um...
[337:22.04]What the fuck?
[337:22.66]Don't do that.
[337:27.06]Toxic working environment.
[337:37.95]What the fuck, man?
[337:39.81]Alright, let's go.
[337:40.77]I feel like a new man.
[337:42.79]I'm ready.
[337:43.35]Wonderful.
[337:44.11]Follow me, please.
[337:45.30]It's right down here.
[337:46.52]Best of luck in your interview, 47.
[337:48.86]Let's see where this will lead you to.
[337:51.66]I just need to start grabbing trash cans and puking at them.
[337:54.31]I gotta keep the character going.
[337:56.19]Come on, man.
[337:56.81]Hi, I'm here for the interview.
[338:05.08]It's important...
[338:19.79]The right answers are above behind them.
[338:21.13]Spoilers for everybody watching.
[338:42.98]We already did this.
[338:43.56]This is just cleaning it up.
[338:44.26]That one.
[338:44.59]What do you mean wrong?
[338:45.21]What the hell are you talking about?
[339:14.79]I thought you guys said that it's the ones that are just right behind them.
[339:20.45]Well.
[339:21.25]Oh, I'm fucking really, really stupid.
[339:24.09]Like, I... I have no... There's no defense on that one.
[339:32.63]I got plenty of offense.
[339:34.37]I can't defend that one.
[339:37.09]There's no way I can.
[339:38.93]I could say anything to you guys.
[339:40.15]What do I say about that?
[339:44.56]There ain't nothing I can do about that.
[339:46.24]He'd be digging a deeper grave.
[339:47.00]Yeah, there's no... Okay.
[339:47.62]I know sometimes when I'm wrong.
[339:48.32]That's one of those times.
[339:49.00]This one.
[340:11.11]Now look at it closely.
[340:12.15]Take a few moments.
[340:14.59]Then tell me, do you see an animal or an object?
[340:18.33]Animal.
[340:18.99]I see.
[340:19.95]What kind of animal?
[340:21.21]A bird.
[340:22.47]An eagle, perhaps.
[340:23.85]An eagle.
[340:25.09]Very interesting.
[340:26.10]A forceful animal.
[340:28.06]Anything else?
[340:29.12]It's feeding on something.
[340:32.02]Feeding?
[340:33.08]On what?
[340:33.98]A carcass.
[340:35.72]The scene is reflected in a pool of blood flowing from the body.
[340:39.66]And do they not know?
[340:40.64]It's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill.
[340:44.22]That's very graphic, Mr. Thomas.
[340:46.97]Yes.
[340:47.97]Brutal, even.
[340:49.07]Right.
[340:50.89]Very interesting observation, Mr. Thomas.
[340:53.95]Not what we expected, but that's perfectly fine.
[340:57.81]Let's take the next one, shall we?
[340:59.67]Pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of execution, please.
[341:07.44]This one.
[341:09.12]The one all the way to the left.
[341:10.62]He's got something in his hand.
[341:33.74]He has dual firearms.
[341:35.58]I see.
[341:35.82]Mr. Potter.
[341:36.62]I think it's this one.
[342:06.09]What I like to do in interviews is I like to put my hands over my mouth and just go... I just put my hand up, arm up and just go... And I go, sorry, I'm gonna shake those out.
[342:26.32]I'm gonna shake those nerves out and shake fucking wildly back and forth and blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.
[342:31.74]And I put my hand up to shake the hand again for whoever wants to shake it.
[342:33.74]I got the job.
[342:35.54]Tomorrow?
[342:35.94]I want to start today.
[343:04.87]I wanna start today.
[343:05.99]Got the job.
[343:07.01]Everybody, I got the job.
[343:32.73]That's right!
[343:33.33]This guy!
[343:34.47]Your new colleague!
[343:37.07]Hey, Carol!
[343:38.21]Frank!
[343:40.69]Hopefully my desk will be next to you!
[343:49.86]Did I save it?
[343:55.35]I didn't save it.
[343:58.37]It doesn't matter.
[343:59.15]I did the interview.
[344:00.21]I've already been up there.
[344:05.19]We already did this.
[344:05.95]I already did the seat.
[344:06.61]Yeah, I did everything already.
[344:25.04]Get off the fucking wall.
[344:26.08]Whoa.
[344:31.22]Hey, hey.
[344:36.71]I have to get out of this game.
[344:39.84]Now.
[344:40.32]I have to get out of the game.
[344:49.99]I have to leave this game.
[345:03.86]Come on in.
[345:05.24]Let's go!
[345:05.52]I'll sit here until 50 people come in here and slip.
[345:34.85]Wait, that can only happen once.
[345:37.53]Holy fuck, that's a lot of people.
[345:42.93]I see, I see.
[346:05.94]trying to shoot his gun.
[346:14.68]Okay, I'm done.
[346:31.68]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[346:32.62]That was it.
[346:35.54]more more more no no I can't I can't I can't do anymore I'll do one more thing no that's it that's it alright I'll throw one more object at one more person okay
[347:01.53]That's it.
[347:02.13]One object is getting thrown at one person.
[347:03.90]That's all I'm going to do.
[347:05.12]That's all I'm setting out to do.
[347:07.12]There's no other goal.
[347:15.77]That's it.
[347:16.85]It's the first item I see.
[347:17.97]It's going to get thrown at the nearest person.
[347:22.24]What item is it?
[347:24.00]There it is.
[347:26.06]Closest item.
[347:26.64]What is it?
[347:26.92]It's a... Of course, it's a coconut.
[347:28.88]Perfect.
[347:29.26]Who's the closest person by proximity?
[347:30.94]It's you.
[347:31.60]I'm sorry.
[347:44.71]I fucking missed.
[348:11.41]There's no... There's no other objects around.
[348:15.47]I've... Might as well finish the mission then.
[348:18.49]Let's eliminate Sierra Knox.
[348:19.53]Sorry.
[348:31.64]I remember playing this mission and trying to drop somebody onto the tracks.
[348:34.88]Joe, get out of the way.
[348:36.68]I go first.
[348:37.28]I go first.
[348:41.81]How do I get over there?
[348:45.61]Oh, I have an illegal item.
[348:46.79]What?
[348:54.40]That guy was holding a pretend gun.
[349:11.58]I got dropped.
[349:21.74]What even happened with the coconut?
[349:31.94]I'm trying to dodge.
[349:35.14]Stop dodging.
[349:35.96]I didn't do anything.
[349:44.82]That doesn't make sense.
[349:55.53]Jeez.
[349:56.13]Hmm.
[349:57.09]That's pretty strange.
[350:02.19]There's no objects, guys.
[350:03.87]I can't... There it is.
[350:17.18]Wait, did I... No, you can have this back.
[350:20.46]I didn't... Excuse me, sir.
[350:21.54]I think you dropped that cheese.
[350:23.04]Come on, pick that up.
[350:29.45]That's the perfect con.
[350:34.06]That's the perfect con.
[350:36.22]I distracted him, gave it back, my accomplice picked it up.
[350:41.28]What a dick.
[350:44.56]You deserve this.
[350:48.08]There it is, I hit one person.
[350:50.74]Give me that coin back.
[350:54.49]Asshole.
[350:56.71]Here, take this back.
[351:00.55]I got your money back!
[351:45.45]The fuck was that?
[351:49.80]Oh.
[351:50.88]Cars.
[351:53.55]They're not really searching very well, are they?
[352:29.93]One clip is down.
[352:34.67]I hope this guy runs out of ammo.
[352:38.39]Two.
[352:46.06]That's three.
[352:54.10]Four.
[352:55.78]Does he have infinite ammo?
[353:04.86]He's gonna have so many.
[353:07.21]No!
[353:08.13]You'll ruin everything!
[353:09.17]You're gonna ruin everything!
[353:12.09]I would have sat there for as long as it took for them to drop like a hundred to two hundred clips on the ground.
[353:29.94]Alright, that's it.
[353:33.54]We've been going for us six hours.
[353:35.32]I think that's a good place to call it for tonight.
[353:49.93]We could still do one last one.
[354:03.30]sir I'm sorry I can't let you you can't be here okay this is not a place for you to be hey you hold it there I'm gonna bring you down
[354:41.31]Are you kidding me?
[354:44.89]Are you kidding me?
[354:46.37]Who's gonna activate the alarm?
[355:13.06]One, two, three, instant headshot.
[355:16.43]Game was laggy.
[355:17.33]That's it, I have to leave.
[355:23.81]That was the germagrain screen.
[355:25.71]Okay, goodnight everybody.
[355:37.21]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[355:40.25]This has been, we did all the DLC for Hitman.
[356:02.64]He's doing one-shot kills.
[356:04.34]Okay, is it safe to leave?
[356:15.28]Not done yet.
[356:21.31]Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne!
[356:23.01]I knew I was gonna hear it at some point.
[356:38.44]What?
[356:38.68]No, I didn't want to shoot him in the back!
[356:40.43]I wanted to knock him out!
[356:41.53]Help me!
[356:43.21]You gotta help me!
[356:47.27]Hey!
[356:50.97]Goddamn!
[356:52.26]I wanted to, like, pistol-whip the... Spock... The... Karate... Chop... Vulcan... Neck... Hit... Thing.
[357:00.60]We got a thing to do over here.
[357:01.92]Now copy.
[357:02.38]Over.
[357:03.26]We got a certified murderer here.
[357:05.13]Safety's off.
[357:05.89]Weapon's hot.
[357:08.40]Who is this?
[357:08.86]Yeah, get him, Steve!
[357:14.71]What?!
[357:18.65]I have to ult out for her.
[357:41.04]No, that's it.
[357:41.68]That's it.
[357:42.08]I'm done.
[357:42.44]I'm out of here.
[357:43.64]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[357:46.86]This has been a really, really fun couple of streams with Hitman.
[357:51.61]Highly recommend the game.
[357:52.57]It's very fun.
[357:53.17]DLC is pretty substantial.
[357:55.05]Seems like a lot to do.
[357:57.51]That's it.
[358:00.33]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[358:05.23]By the way, I still haven't figured this out.
[358:11.02]This has been the same for a week and a half.
[358:13.13]It's supposed to be the session.
[358:15.09]Why is it doing this?
[358:21.71]See you tomorrow.
[358:22.29]With this, at least three or four games are going to jump in tomorrow.
[358:27.98]It's going to be a weird one, I feel.
[358:33.12]And then I think I want to try to do the first community night on Friday.
[358:38.06]But...
[358:41.43]Let's get the bits out here from earlier this afternoon.
[358:50.67]Any plans for horror games this month?
[358:52.13]Yeah, I think so.
[358:56.45]I would say yes.
[359:00.32]A few things have come out.
[359:06.34]Anything major?
[359:07.58]Well, not necessarily.
[359:11.91]I'll take a look.
[359:16.11]Well, let's go back.
[359:16.76]We had $2.50 from Devakitty.
[359:20.96]Did I have fun at TwitchCon?
[359:23.10]I like this picture that shows your compactness clear as day.
[359:28.16]This is the Jeremy pissed his pants picture.
[359:35.14]Guys, let me tell you something.
[359:36.18]Don't ever, under any circumstances, don't ever have water or oil or something.
[359:46.21]Don't ever touch anything and then touch your pants.
[359:48.93]Apparently.
[359:52.73]Because then this will happen.
[359:56.93]Let me get it on here.
[360:00.71]I need to do this.
[360:07.19]Yeah.
[360:11.33]You guys were so quick too.
[360:12.83]I take like a couple dozen pictures at TwitchCon and all of a sudden... This shit happens.
[360:33.70]If you didn't know any better, that- this is real.
[360:38.92]You know what I mean?
[360:41.28]There are people on this Earth right now that really, truly think that I pissed my pants at TwitchCon.
[360:49.27]And it doesn't matter what I say.
[360:52.25]I could be like, no, it doesn't matter.
[360:54.61]I have to just embrace it.
[360:56.47]I pissed my pants at TwitchCon.
[360:59.89]It was really embarrassing.
[361:06.86]It's a good picture, though.
[361:07.68]I like this picture, regardless of the piss pants.
[361:15.84]Imagine if, like, there was actual piss on, like, Shippy or Talx's leg.
[361:22.03]See, that's, like, the 500 IQ play there, is, like, you put a little bit over here, too, and it's like, wait a minute.
[361:27.45]I know you did that one, but did you do this one?
[361:29.13]Hmm.
[361:32.49]Where is the original?
[361:33.35]I'm not even sure the original is online.
[361:35.41]It's been re-edited 50 times.
[361:41.10]But, thank you for that picture.
[361:42.90]Appreciate it.
[361:51.58]Yeah, I've seen them all.
[361:53.48]You're not going to show me ones I haven't seen yet.
[361:57.71]I know all of them.
[362:05.24]Yeah, that is the original.
[362:06.44]But that's not piss.
[362:08.94]I don't even... Whatever.
[362:10.64]It is.
[362:11.10]Fine.
[362:11.62]Who cares?
[362:17.17]So, that was... I believe that was Devakitty.
[362:20.21]Thank you for the $2.50.
[362:20.73]Yeah, and I wore a blue shirt with, like, a white front.
[362:28.42]And all of a sudden, it was like, oh, let's make him look like he wore this thing.
[362:35.71]Uh, thank you to Jerma's Stinky Feet.
[362:38.87]Thanks for the five dollars.
[362:42.01]Chat, Jerma has not washed us since the carnival.
[362:45.79]What do you mean, washed us?
[362:48.36]The bacteria in the dunk tank has allowed us to achieve sentience.
[362:50.98]We have a telepathically possessed one of Jerma's fans.
[362:53.86]Just so we can beg all of you to tell Jerma to take a shower.
[362:58.54]What?
[362:58.68]What?
[363:02.82]Oh, right.
[363:04.58]Okay.
[363:05.36]I get your username.
[363:06.94]Right.
[363:08.54]God.
[363:09.38]Alright.
[363:14.02]Whatever.
[363:15.24]Why do my feet talk?
[363:17.26]This is freaking me out.
[363:25.41]Thank you for the five dollars.
[363:26.89]I really appreciate it.
[363:28.35]We are the bacteria.
[363:29.51]No, you're not.
[363:30.29]Alright.
[363:32.86]Thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50.
[363:36.38]Heard about him.
[363:39.39]Heard he was really, really annoying, but what can you do?
[363:41.05]He's mean.
[363:41.35]He's a mean-spirited person.
[364:06.21]Thank you, Gnarly.
[364:06.79]Appreciate it.
[364:08.59]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250 bits.
[364:12.06]Hey, Jeremy, hope all is well.
[364:13.82]And you had a good time at TwitchCon.
[364:15.08]I did.
[364:15.98]It was very, very productive.
[364:17.16]Very, very good.
[364:18.86]I recently made a YouTube channel and uploaded my first video.
[364:22.25]It's kind of cringey, not gonna lie, but who cares?
[364:24.59]It's my cringe, and I've been getting nothing but support.
[364:27.67]Anyway, see you around.
[364:29.41]Go watch the first hundred videos I ever made.
[364:33.76]So...
[364:35.41]You know.
[364:36.13]What are you linking now?
[364:38.07]Yes, I've seen this one too.
[364:42.92]This is what I'm talking about.
[364:44.06]Like, there's just no escape.
[364:46.94]I've seen it.
[364:47.72]Yes.
[364:51.18]The one with my head is like the size of a grape next to these two people here.
[364:56.77]How do you meticulously cut somebody out and just like shrink them by like 25%?
[365:00.95]Like, it's so...
[365:07.46]I want the original and I want this back-to-back so she can see the efforts that go into this Where's the original?
[365:28.74]Okay, so here's this one And like very very clearly
[365:44.11]Look at how much work that is What the hell is this?
[365:52.94]It isn't really though That's the original no, this is the original
[366:09.03]I'm gonna go right to the Twitter where it came from.
[366:12.73]The background is plain.
[366:13.61]It's easier to do.
[366:14.23]Alright, so let's... This is the original.
[366:23.22]We'll put it next to the other one.
[366:25.10]Just so you can see.
[366:26.48]I gotta defend myself here.
[366:27.91]Otherwise, come on.
[366:29.25]What are we gonna do?
[366:41.79]That's not, that is, where is it?
[366:42.89]Okay, here it is.
[366:45.48]This is the original.
[366:52.03]Like, look at this.
[367:11.08]See what I'm saying?
[367:11.74]It's so, it's so slight.
[367:16.59]Like you, you, you've made him larger and you've shrunk.
[367:20.67]It's just, it's deceiving.
[367:28.66]You've made them like huge.
[367:30.32]You've made these two 20% bigger and you made me like 10% smaller.
[367:43.55]Oh, God.
[367:48.87]What can I do, though?
[367:53.93]I can't tell.
[367:54.57]It's an optical illusion.
[367:55.73]Now, I just saw them both up close, and I was like, what the fuck?
[367:59.98]They're both fake.
[368:03.24]They're not... This is what happens.
[368:07.94]When there's so many fake things out there, nobody knows what the real one is.
[368:11.72]That's by design.
[368:17.95]It's by design.
[368:19.99]So the truth gets muddy.
[368:25.64]Anyways, thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[368:27.62]Good luck on your YouTube channel.
[368:32.60]You kind of learned a lot about yourself the first, I'd say, 50 videos or so.
[368:37.31]Maybe even less than that.
[368:39.07]But thank you.
[368:41.23]Thank you also to the Wombat from Hell for the 250 bits.
[368:46.18]Hi Jerem, I want to make a game recommendation.
[368:48.52]The game is called The Hex.
[368:49.96]It's by the developer of Pony Island.
[368:51.90]And it's about six hours long.
[368:54.00]What is Pony Island?
[368:58.16]It's one of the coolest games I've ever played.
[369:00.35]And if you did want to play it, I wouldn't advise knowing too much about the game as it could spoil the experience.
[369:06.25]Hm.
[369:07.05]Okay.
[369:10.63]Is this... Is it good?
[369:15.77]The Hex.
[369:16.53]Is this a stream game?
[369:20.07]Toss it in the recommended.
[369:20.96]I'll take a look at it.
[369:26.18]Hey, Pigeon!
[369:28.82]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[369:32.09]I remember meeting you at TwitchCon.
[369:34.22]Finally got the chance to meet you and I didn't think I'd be so nervous and I certainly didn't think you'd be just as energetic in person as on stream.
[369:40.76]Makes me happy to know that you're not playing a character and you're genuinely an amazing person.
[369:44.76]Anyway, proof that you're actually 5'8".
[369:47.52]And a video proof of it as well.
[369:49.58]I've seen this circulating with the tape measure.
[369:56.42]This has... This has 25,000 views.
[370:06.64]It's been viewed 25,000 times.
[370:08.20]What the fuck?
[370:21.61]Show it.
[370:22.61]Show it.
[370:23.13]Show it.
[370:23.98]Show it.
[370:24.28]I just linked it.
[370:25.62]Look.
[370:26.28]There's some things.
[370:28.10]There's some things in life.
[370:31.40]That I don't want to show on my stream.
[370:34.36]And one of them is me being measured for the tape measure.
[370:37.20]You know what?
[370:37.82]Fuck it.
[370:38.10]Let's go.
[370:45.57]Alright, let's do it.
[370:46.57]Fine.
[370:47.03]Let's show it.
[370:51.69]How do I just pull out the video?
[370:53.78]Can I even do that?
[370:54.36]I think I have to do this.
[371:05.70]Is there a way just to go right to a video?
[371:08.45]Yeah, Twitter video.
[371:09.07]I'm just gonna have to do it.
[371:11.09]I'm just gonna have to capture the browser.
[371:13.61]Oh, hold on.
[371:13.93]Give me one second.
[371:14.71]Maybe I can do it like this.
[371:19.95]Can I do it like this?
[371:26.88]What the fuck?
[371:27.46]I can't.
[371:27.92]Hold on.
[371:30.62]Browser source.
[371:34.11]there we go add source uh add a new source there we go does this work see if it works I guess it works did it work can you see it oh there you go you can see it can you hear it alright listen listen listen listen up
[372:04.43]Can you hear it?
[372:16.14]Yeah, three people were there to take a look at it.
[372:23.26]I thought, for a second, I really thought that it was a doctored photo.
[372:26.66]Like, I thought that it was gonna be, like, they made their own tape measure.
[372:32.31]Okay, I've seen a lot of people say why do you look so weird here?
[372:35.49]It's I don't know It's like it's the camera this camera was like strange.
[372:39.35]It was almost like I was up.
[372:40.43]You know I'm saying I don't know why I look like my legs look so strange here Standing on my toes we talking about these just someone a pair of sneakers.
[372:55.77]Oh
[373:09.87]See?
[373:13.18]No, I'm telling you, it's the camera.
[373:14.98]It's the camera.
[373:15.40]It's one of these new, like, Samsung Galaxy 10s.
[373:22.78]It's got, like, a fisheye lens on it.
[373:32.24]See?
[373:32.46]I don't need to prove anything else.
[373:35.32]Alright, we're getting derailed here.
[373:41.47]We've got to go back to the bits.
[373:46.01]But that was some pigeon.
[373:46.67]Thank you, pigeon.
[373:49.50]It was a pleasure.
[373:53.48]Thank you for the 500 bits, and I hope you had a good TwitchCon afterwards as well.
[374:01.44]It was $10 from... Anonymous, I think?
[374:07.22]Can you even do that?
[374:08.10]I don't see... There's nothing here.
[374:09.10]It just says 1,000 bits came in.
[374:14.12]From nobody, I guess.
[374:14.98]That's interesting.
[374:16.22]That's new.
[374:19.65]Atma Starfish, thanks for the five community subs.
[374:21.47]Appreciate it.
[374:26.67]Zake, thanks for the 250 bits.
[374:27.95]They say...
[374:31.33]uh they they say you have uh I think it's a different language I'm not sure what that means I don't know how to say it but they say when cooking stream just wait maybe someday maybe someday I'll do a cooking stream I don't know just wait it might happen I don't know you've been asking for it yeah it's possible
[375:00.37]Someday.
[375:01.55]Someday confirmed in the future.
[375:03.05]He'll look into it.
[375:03.75]That's right.
[375:06.45]Hey, Sad Vega, thanks for the $2.50, 250 bits.
[375:09.43]I need to see you do 250 box steps right now.
[375:13.47]That would probably take 20 minutes.
[375:19.84]I don't have a box to step on, unfortunately.
[375:24.54]But thank you.
[375:26.84]Thank you, Apple Shift, for the 250 bits.
[375:30.80]Heyo, do you have a set date for the community art stream?
[375:34.86]Uh, Friday.
[375:37.16]I'm gonna try to get everything compiled on Friday.
[375:39.83]If not Friday, then probably... No, there's no reason why it wouldn't be Friday.
[375:50.63]That channel has been active for just about a full month now.
[375:56.39]We'll see what's there.
[375:57.65]If I don't think there's enough there for a whole couple hours or two or three hours at least, then I'll do it another time.
[376:05.86]But there should be enough there.
[376:09.44]Is it going to be a one-time thing or monthly or something?
[376:12.10]It is going to be every time I think there is enough content there to do one.
[376:20.05]Whether that's once a month or once every other month.
[376:23.73]Once there's enough to do a full at least couple hours.
[376:29.39]That's when they'll happen.
[376:30.87]And I will announce them at least three or four days.
[376:34.13]At least two or three days in advance that they're going to happen.
[376:38.03]Usually like a week.
[376:40.71]The last thing I said about it was before TwitchCon.
[376:42.53]I said we would do it after TwitchCon.
[376:44.61]At some point.
[376:46.13]Friday seems like it's the good day to do it.
[376:50.64]Thank you, Fitty, for the 250 bits.
[376:52.85]I forgot you only read bit messages with at least 250.
[376:54.67]So I'm going to copy and paste from before when I give 100.
[377:00.61]This message has been brought to you by the I pay extra money to add disclaimer for the off chance that the streamer reads both copies of the message for some reason.
[377:07.16]Gang.
[377:13.53]Thank you, Fitty, for the six dollars here.
[377:18.23]And they say, literally, everything you do is funny to me, Jeremy.
[377:21.46]Thank you for always being there for me throughout the years.
[377:24.32]You always manage to distract me from the bad things in life.
[377:27.24]For years, I've been struggling to fall asleep as my mind would always wander to some really terrible fucked up stuff that left me anxious and unable to calm down.
[377:34.85]Whenever I have one of your streams of VODs on in the background, I can sleep like a baby.
[377:38.95]Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[377:43.10]Thank you, Fitty.
[377:45.89]If these streams are a nice little wind down for anybody.
[377:50.93]Yeah, however you consume this stream.
[377:57.49]Wherever you can get any enjoyment from it.
[378:01.31]I'm glad you do.
[378:04.70]Thank you so much for your six dollars.
[378:07.78]Your six hundred bits.
[378:13.04]You just called your streams boring.
[378:16.92]I don't think, no, I don't, but whatever, you know, if people... I get it, I get it.
[378:25.74]I understand, like, you just kind of need something just to have on the background.
[378:29.14]Guys, a lot of people do Twitch while they're at work, working on a project, they just have a tab, another random tab just open, it's almost like a radio station.
[378:39.04]That's alright, that doesn't bother me.
[378:46.13]I don't know why it would.
[378:47.07]It just kind of... However you are consuming what the stream is, that's fine to me.
[378:54.02]As long as you're getting something out of it, that's cool.
[378:57.04]Hey, thank you Maris for the thousand bits.
[379:01.25]Appreciate it.
[379:03.36]Hey Jerma, I met you twice at TwitchCon and I wanted to say thank you for being an amazing person.
[379:08.07]It made my weekend being able to meet my favorite streamer.
[379:11.51]Much love.
[379:12.63]The tall girl in the overalls with no sharpie.
[379:15.95]I remember you.
[379:17.92]I did come prepared that next day, though.
[379:20.18]I was like, you know what?
[379:22.90]I want this because I think I might need it.
[379:27.28]It was an absolute pleasure.
[379:28.28]Thank you for even flagging me down in the first place.
[379:33.21]To anybody that said hello at TwitchCon, it was great.
[379:36.71]Every conversation was pleasant.
[379:43.86]What's probably going to happen next year at TwitchCon is I'm going to do an official meetup.
[379:49.64]Because as the channel has grown...
[379:53.57]I was actually told that I couldn't do a... Hey!
[379:57.33]Meet me under this sign!
[379:59.38]I explicitly asked.
[380:01.64]And I was told that you can't do that.
[380:04.94]So, next year at TwitchCon, I'm gonna do an official... meet and greet... at a booth somewhere.
[380:14.88]Just because I know there's a lot of people that probably wanted to say hello.
[380:17.80]I know I saw at least a few messages afterwards that were like, oh, I didn't get a chance to see you.
[380:21.26]I didn't get a chance to say hello.
[380:23.46]So I'm just going to do an official one next time.
[380:29.44]And of course, besides that, if you see me walking around, grab me and say hello.
[380:38.06]Terma Rumble at TwitchCon.
[380:39.58]I don't know about that.
[380:41.34]But thank you for the thousand bits, Maris.
[380:44.71]Pleasure was all mine.
[380:45.45]Thank you.
[380:49.23]Colucia, thanks for the 500 bits.
[380:52.47]Hi, Jerma.
[380:52.87]Meeting you at TwitchCon was awesome.
[380:54.05]You were so energetic and fun to talk to.
[380:55.97]Thanks for hanging out for a bit, even though I was so nervous.
[380:58.93]Hope you had a good rest of the con, and I'm glad you're back.
[381:02.99]No, it was awesome talking to everybody.
[381:10.36]Nobody, let me tell you this.
[381:11.22]Nobody really came off as nervous or not comfortable.
[381:16.15]It was whatever you were feeling.
[381:19.95]I didn't see it.
[381:20.43]We were just having a good conversation.
[381:26.70]I did have a great rest of my con.
[381:29.10]A lot of productive shit went down.
[381:32.96]A lot of stuff behind the scenes, guys, is starting to move.
[381:39.38]I cannot wait for you to see the stuff that's gonna happen later.
[381:45.88]Lot of cool stuff.
[381:48.24]I'll leave it at that.
[381:52.52]Thank you to C4G for the 250 bits.
[381:57.34]It's a bunch of emojis.
[381:58.90]It's a hey, little piss baby.
[382:01.46]You think you're so fucking cool, huh?
[382:02.96]You think you're tough.
[382:04.90]You talk a lot of big game for someone with such a small truck
[382:11.30]And it's a bunch of emojis.
[382:14.80]Thank you for the 250.
[382:16.02]Appreciate it.
[382:16.52]Yeah, I am... I'm just a shit streamer when it comes to getting new things added to the channel.
[382:20.98]I really have to get on top of that.
[382:23.18]I say it every time, but you know, it's true.
[382:40.82]It's just true, you know.
[382:44.87]We're gonna run the credits.
[382:48.01]Right now.
[382:50.29]Here they come.
[382:54.79]Because we are now at the end of the stream.
[382:56.37]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[383:00.20]The theater is now closing.
[383:03.52]In another five minutes or so.
[383:09.82]I like this screen a lot.
[383:11.06]But that's it.
[383:15.36]Whoops.
[383:16.21]Now that's it.
[383:20.45]See you guys tomorrow.
[383:21.75]We're gonna run the credits.
[383:25.09]Those of you that you can stick around if you want to see... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[383:30.53]I really just fucked this whole thing up.
[383:32.54]Still learning Streamlabs OBS, although I'm probably just going to go back to regular OBS because they've added a few great features that I really want to use.
[383:41.18]And it's annoying because I just went back.
[383:44.07]I just went to Streamlabs OBS and then found out that they added an insanely, insanely helpful feature on the new OBS that released last week.
[383:54.78]So I'll be back to the... Unfortunately.
[383:57.02]Because I really liked Streamlabs OBS's layout.
[384:01.20]But the regular OBS is just probably way better for me at this point.
[384:05.49]So shit.
[384:07.29]But where the hell is my credits?
[384:09.57]Why are they not here?
[384:10.09]Where are the credits?
[384:19.28]Hello?
[384:20.36]Credits?
[384:23.92]Where the fuck did they go?
[384:29.52]Where are my credits?
[384:32.46]I lost them.
[384:36.26]How?
[384:41.58]What the fuck is going on?
[384:43.52]They're here somewhere.
[384:44.48]Hold on.
[384:44.90]I'll find them.
[384:47.94]They're not here anymore.
[384:49.26]How is that possible?
[384:50.02]I don't understand.
[384:52.66]Okay.
[384:52.96]What the fuck?
[385:01.31]I need to add this then alright give me a sec I'm doing this on the fly trying to figure this out but wait a minute this should be it here found it alright hey here come those credits it wasn't enabled it was down here sorry I keep bumping into you I'm sorry I'm sorry
[385:29.77]Thank you, everybody, for subscribing to the channel.
[385:33.08]A shitload of new subs have come in very recently.
[385:38.44]That's supposed to be behind, but, you know, that's okay.
[385:42.51]It's supposed to be on the screen, but we do what we can.
[385:49.79]Thank you, everybody.
[385:53.30]Let's finish up the last of the bits.
[385:58.72]Thank you, Amazing Sponge, for the 250.
[386:00.18]Hey, Jeremy, lots of stuff is changing my life right now.
[386:03.26]I'm getting pulled out of school for some psychiatric stuff, but you're always there at the end of a long, weird, and new day.
[386:08.95]Thank you so much, and love from Rhode Island.
[386:13.37]I wish you luck.
[386:17.47]Hopefully, whatever it is that's happening, you can get on top of that.
[386:27.06]Getting pulled out of school, I wonder, um, I don't really know the context as to why, but that can always be very jarring.
[386:36.45]So hopefully you get through whatever that is.
[386:41.33]Thank you so much for the 250 bits.
[386:45.56]Hopefully your life changes for the better.
[386:48.88]And Rhode Island is a great state.
[386:50.14]That's one of the New England states.
[386:51.48]It's one of my favorites.
[386:57.39]I miss New England sometimes.
[387:02.01]But it's not like I'll never go back.
[387:06.07]Thank you, Amazing Sponge, for the 250.
[387:11.48]And good luck.
[387:16.00]Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 500 bits.
[387:21.02]So, Jerma, this bit donation is a serious one.
[387:23.16]Sorry for ruining the vibes.
[387:26.31]But if you remember me from about six months ago, with DBD, ask me in chat if you want to know what I mean by that.
[387:33.05]And my mental health has been deteriorating for about a year and a half.
[387:39.00]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[387:44.30]I was in kind of a mood and about to get fired from the only job I had.
[387:47.77]One of the only reasons I didn't was because of the carnival stream.
[387:52.11]So you are a literal lifesaver.
[387:53.47]Thank you.
[387:58.94]Well, here's the thing.
[388:02.43]I really, truly hope that whatever it is you're going through, you can really figure it out.
[388:12.33]Going through problems, going through mental health issues, it's rough and it's hard to do.
[388:22.68]Everybody has their own way of getting through it.
[388:28.36]But I really, really hope that you can find the right way forward.
[388:40.47]Things can get better.
[388:49.89]But it may, I mean, it's not that you keep saying I don't want to ruin the vibes or anything, but
[388:55.33]No, it's just... We're all people, man.
[388:59.47]I might be on a livestream platform, but... I felt like shit before.
[389:05.06]Let me tell you.
[389:07.28]Oh, yeah.
[389:12.42]Everybody has their own path forward.
[389:15.38]And my path forward might not be the same for you.
[389:19.28]Everybody's very different.
[389:22.90]But I really, truly hope you find it.
[389:27.18]And I'm really glad that you liked the carnival stream.
[389:30.46]Because I made the thing for you.
[389:34.29]All of you.
[389:37.47]That's the only reason why I did it.
[389:39.97]And if I'm able to do something like that again, I'm going to do it again.
[389:51.79]Take care of yourself.
[389:53.57]I wish you the best for real.
[389:57.25]Hopefully you can go through either the professional or therapy or any of the methods that are available to you and try to get it figured out.
[390:14.06]Good luck.
[390:15.70]Much love to you.
[390:16.66]Take care of yourself.
[390:23.87]We're also now getting, uh, right now, I think, well, actually, a minute or two ago.
[390:28.91]Alamitos, thank you for the 269 bits.
[390:33.81]You ever wonder what people are saying when you leave to go to the bathroom?
[390:36.31]Do you wonder if Chad is talking shit about you behind your back?
[390:40.86]I don't worry about that at all.
[390:44.00]Guys, I just got linked like a half dozen pictures of me with piss on my pants.
[390:50.26]It's alright.
[390:50.94]It's gonna be fine.
[390:51.78]Whatever anybody says, it's okay.
[390:54.58]It's not going to bother me very much.
[391:01.51]You should talk by face.
[391:02.67]You don't need to do it behind my back.
[391:06.07]It's all in good fun, though.
[391:07.34]I know.
[391:08.88]Don't worry.
[391:10.95]Hey, Alistair H2O, thanks for the 250 bits.
[391:13.17]I think you missed the epilogue cutscene from the Heaven Island mission.
[391:16.00]It's got good Hitman 3 teasers.
[391:21.14]I don't want to see it.
[391:22.02]I don't want to see it.
[391:22.54]I don't want to see it.
[391:23.02]I don't want to see it.
[391:23.74]I wouldn't be surprised when Hitman 3 comes out.
[391:30.09]I'm one of those people.
[391:31.07]I don't look at anything.
[391:32.37]I just wait until it comes out.
[391:38.13]You want his tuber reaction.
[391:42.26]And finally, at the very end.
[391:45.72]Sorry for bumping you again.
[391:46.64]We had Spooky Spitfire for another 250 bits.
[391:50.63]I'm doing a Soulsborne.
[391:52.03]I die twice more than twice.
[391:55.13]Where I play the games in chronological order.
[391:58.49]Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3.
[392:03.05]SD2.
[392:05.13]What's SD2?
[392:12.76]Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3.
[392:15.84]SD2.
[392:17.88]Sekiro?
[392:21.15]Excluding Demon's Souls because it isn't on the PS4, where I have to use a Katana or Blades of Mercy in Bloodborne.
[392:26.75]DLC optional.
[392:27.53]It's pretty fun.
[392:28.83]Shadows die twice.
[392:30.17]Oh, okay.
[392:32.85]That's an interesting way to do it.
[392:34.03]Okay, that's... SD2.
[392:35.99]Shadows die twice.
[392:41.15]Oh...
[392:42.87]Alright, that's cool.
[392:43.51]Yeah, because it's like DS1, DS2, BB, DS3, S. What, S?
[392:53.13]SD2.
[392:53.53]No, I like that.
[392:57.01]SSD2, yeah.
[393:01.42]I would play through all the Soulsborne games again all the way through, but I've played them all.
[393:09.32]Even on stream, out of order, too.
[393:12.77]If you're gonna see me play one of these games again on stream... I did Dark Souls Remastered.
[393:18.05]I did Dark Souls 3.
[393:19.97]Very much out of order.
[393:22.49]I've never done Dark Souls 2 on stream, except for that one time when some fucking guy climbed in my window.
[393:28.43]And, boy, was that annoying.
[393:30.86]And it ruined the rest of my playthrough.
[393:33.80]I never played it again after that.
[393:36.98]The thing is, when things just sour your playthrough, you can't go back to them.
[393:41.60]You know what I mean?
[393:45.99]And then Bloodborne I've beaten a hundred times already, so... Kinda gonna wait for the next one.
[393:50.31]You will definitely see Elden Ring on this stream.
[393:52.75]Whenever... The launch day.
[393:57.55]But... I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[394:00.54]Have a fantastic rest of your evening.
[394:02.02]We're gonna do just... We're gonna do random... Easy shit tomorrow.
[394:06.18]We're gonna do... An idle game tomorrow.
[394:08.92]It's either the biggest mistake I've ever made or like a... A 12-hour stream where I can't stop.
[394:15.24]We'll see.
[394:17.61]It's the phone in stream.
[394:19.31]No, it's not going to be phoned in.
[394:22.50]I want to see what it's like.
[394:24.24]If it sucks, we can play something else.
[394:31.88]Play Jackbox?
[394:32.50]The new Jackbox is coming out soon, isn't it?
[394:37.89]Like next month or something?
[394:44.94]It's gonna be a rant stream.
[394:46.14]No, it's gonna be a mouth-open, lean-back-in-the-chair stream, I think.
[394:58.30]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[394:59.36]Good night, guys.
[395:00.76]Have a great rest of your evening.
[395:02.62]Take care.
[395:03.88]Goodbye.
[395:20.67]you
