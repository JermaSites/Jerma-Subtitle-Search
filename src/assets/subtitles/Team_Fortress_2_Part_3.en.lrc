[06:18.88]I'm going to have to call it quits sooner or later here.
[06:26.74]I sound sad.
[06:27.48]I'm sorry.
[06:28.12]I'm just currently dealing with a medical issue right now.
[06:32.95]And I'm trying to squelch it a little.
[06:36.97]Is it going to play?
[06:38.07]Yeah, I'm going to try it.
[06:42.97]No, I'm alright.
[06:43.71]I'm fine.

[06:52.41]Okay, what am I gonna do?
[06:54.05]Uh... Let's do this guy.
[06:57.71]I've played with this guy before, right?
[07:01.91]So now I'm in like a... I'm in a game.
[07:06.28]Okay.
[07:07.28]So they changed that system where... I have not... This is so new to me.
[07:14.82]So it's just match... This is what people were talking about when they were talking about matchmaking, right?
[07:22.03]Oh, boy.
[07:25.15]Feels kind of good.
[07:30.17]Jar.
[07:30.49]Oh, yeah.
[07:30.91]I have a jar.
[07:31.93]Whoa.
[07:34.79]Was this like this when I tried this a year ago?
[07:36.52]I don't remember it like this.
[07:40.66]Well, let's try it.
[07:43.20]See if I remember how to play this video game.
[07:50.11]It's probably pretty low, audio-wise.
[07:57.54]Where are you Pyro?
[08:03.63]Oh no!
[08:04.05]Oh yeah, the hit sounds are different.
[08:08.65]You can actually pick a hit sound, right?
[08:14.56]And you get experience for doing this?
[08:27.58]Watch out, don't get backstabbed.
[08:29.00]Whoa!
[08:29.40]I'm gonna get backstabbed.
[08:35.99]This is your head sound?
[08:41.39]Thanks.
[08:41.65]Save my life, Pyro, please.
[08:43.85]Before I get embarrassed.
[08:49.10]Whoa!
[08:49.92]That hurts.
[08:54.18]That guy's got the squid hat.
[08:55.64]Yeah, there was like a few items that were... Let's not play scout right now.
[09:01.84]Maybe sniper.
[09:04.34]I don't even know.
[09:14.47]There's the squid.
[09:20.52]The squid hat used to be insanely expensive.
[09:24.30]I remember... What was the most expensive hat?
[09:27.64]A burning team captain when I was playing all the time?
[09:31.63]I think it was like $4,000 or something insane, right?
[09:36.13]The game's not running that well.
[09:43.48]Oh, shit.
[09:47.80]Is it still the most expensive?
[09:52.88]It's six grand now?
[09:59.31]Holy shit.
[10:01.09]So wait, it's gone up in value.
[10:02.61]Alright, I gotta be aware of this dude.
[10:04.05]There he is.
[10:08.40]I'm gonna get shit on here.
[10:11.24]I'm gonna get absolutely diarrhea'd on by this guy.
[10:15.40]Whoa, the fuck?
[10:17.22]Dude, that guy... That was so weird.
[10:20.31]That was strange if I've ever seen it.
[10:29.28]Say it.
[10:29.84]Say it.
[10:34.48]Say it.
[10:36.02]Dead Ringer?
[10:36.48]Yeah, it's been a while.
[10:37.58]I gotta remember.
[10:41.05]Oh, shit.
[10:41.45]I'm in trouble.
[10:45.95]Ah!
[10:49.15]Say shpee.
[10:50.79]I just did.
[10:51.27]There you go.
[10:52.75]I don't think sniper is the best thing to do right now.
[10:55.89]Playing this game for the first time in a year.
[10:57.39]But, you know, that's the only way you can get back into it is if you do it.
[11:07.56]Oh, come on.
[11:10.06]Ow.
[11:13.58]He said the thing.
[11:16.62]Um... No, I'm gonna stay.
[11:25.38]Where is this spy?
[11:26.20]I'm gonna stand in the corner for a second.
[11:39.08]Nope.
[11:43.93]Spy?
[11:45.43]Scared?
[11:45.89]Yeah, I know there's a spy right here somewhere.
[11:55.53]No, he's dead.
[11:57.85]He died.
[12:02.01]You know, you're real.
[12:02.95]You seem real.
[12:09.51]You want me to play spy?
[12:10.58]Oh god, that'll be embarrassing.
[12:20.76]That guy is definitely not dead.
[12:22.98]I'm certain of it.
[12:33.56]I'm so paranoid of that dude.
[12:36.67]BYE!
[12:40.41]Get the camera!
[12:43.39]Local streamer instantly regresses to 2014.
[12:51.29]They nerfed the Dead Ringer, nobody uses it.
[12:52.85]Really?
[12:54.71]That's interesting.
[12:55.27]AHHHHH!
[13:04.79]Should I put on that thing?
[13:06.03]The thing that makes the spies... I'm gonna do the thing that makes the spies get mad and shoot you twice and kill you anyways.
[13:21.08]Oh, well.
[13:21.64]I win.
[13:22.98]I win.
[13:23.34]Like, I did that.
[13:24.02]Oh, I win.
[13:30.62]The claymore is boring now.
[13:32.88]How about my buddy Engineer?
[13:37.78]I can't play Engineer.
[13:39.50]All my key bindings are different.
[13:43.94]Do I even have a Huntsman?
[13:47.13]Let's play with my old favorite weapon.
[13:50.07]Yeah, I don't have any key bindings.
[13:51.43]Engineer will not work for me right now.
[14:00.87]Mmm.
[14:02.50]Holy shit, that guy got by everybody.
[14:12.05]Oh, no, no, no.
[14:14.11]Oh, what do I want to do?
[14:14.87]I'm going to stick with something.
[14:18.67]I'll keep playing with it.
[14:25.70]The only sniper on my team.
[14:27.20]The game sure has changed.
[14:31.62]Instant kill.
[14:38.43]I remember, it's all about like traja- I can't even say the word.
[14:41.35]Trajectory.
[14:48.27]Shit.
[14:50.94]Yeah, I can't.
[14:53.90]I gotta play something that's like easy to do.
[14:55.72]Oh, this was fun.
[14:59.70]Oh, this was a lot of fun.
[15:01.28]I loved this thing.
[15:05.77]The, uh, the cannonball.
[15:09.02]Whoops.
[15:11.22]Whoops again.
[15:12.58]Oopsie.
[15:16.32]The double donker.
[15:23.05]Did they make this thing easier or harder to use?
[15:34.62]What is hurting me?
[15:36.60]Oh.
[15:40.89]Yeah, the Pyro has a new flamethrower.
[15:44.21]They made it harder?
[15:44.95]Oh, it's harder to use it now.
[15:48.01]Let's see.
[15:52.21]Killstreaker?
[15:53.87]Okay.
[15:55.59]Oh yeah, I had a thing on this.
[16:09.67]That guy lagged in the weirdest place.
[16:11.31]That guy lagged in the perfect place for me to not hit him with anything.
[16:17.65]Jesus.
[16:20.23]No, I'm not going to use that.
[16:21.85]I'm going to use... I'm so... I just don't know what the fuck to play as.
[16:27.70]I could just play as dumb heavy.
[16:34.52]What else do I have here?
[16:42.66]Whoa 613 kills take a look at that Fat Scout No I'm essentially playing with a brand new account right now Hit somebody I couldn't get crit lucky.
[17:07.06]Oh
[17:21.63]He was like, no idea what the fuck is going on.
[17:27.45]Right now my face is just like, whoa!
[17:33.48]Look at that, I can't even rocket jump.
[17:37.44]What is even hitting me?
[17:38.62]Who's doing this?
[17:42.74]Oh boy.
[17:43.24]Dude, the rust is fucking real.
[17:53.65]Just stop calling me the Tin Man.
[18:01.23]Oh my goodness.
[18:09.11]Oh, yikes.
[18:10.67]This is the same guy.
[18:12.76]This is the same dude.
[18:17.22]No, I'm not putting on a face cam.
[18:25.25]Let's go back to scope.
[18:30.25]Dude, does Heavy have a new thing called mirror image where he spreads into two people?
[18:43.94]Oh my lord, where was this guy?
[18:46.41]What the fuck?
[18:49.61]I don't even understand.
[18:55.05]That guy has so many points.
[19:05.01]New heavy weapon.
[19:05.83]Alright, let's do something here.
[19:18.06]No.
[19:21.52]I helped.
[19:31.07]I don't know how we still won.
[19:31.99]Alright, so what happens if I leave the game?
[19:37.43]What happens?
[19:42.08]Do I get deserter if I leave?
[19:45.62]Or is that it?
[19:50.50]Oh, okay.
[19:50.82]So if you don't play out, you don't get experience.
[19:55.42]It's casual, so nothing happens.
[19:56.52]Okay.
[19:59.52]Let me see.
[20:02.25]Let's requeue.
[20:03.23]I don't want to play.
[20:04.03]I want to play on like a payload map.
[20:08.70]They can just do that, right?
[20:13.22]They fixed that.
[20:22.23]Bicentennial man versus the machine.
[20:41.16]Let's go.
[20:43.46]Server browser is better than matchmaking?
[20:52.99]You can check your items while... Oh, because yeah, it used to put you in that weird man versus machine menu, right?
[20:59.29]I'm so glad that they fixed that.
[21:02.64]I'm going to play Medic.
[21:03.86]Let's be a team player for a little bit so I can just kind of get back into the swing of things here.
[21:07.66]Let's do... So many of these.
[21:16.80]Uber is six.
[21:18.86]Uber is 91.
[21:19.20]Alright, I have the most Ubers on this thing.
[21:23.11]But what if it's not cool looking like one of these?
[21:25.99]This one's cool looking.
[21:28.21]Well, this matches.
[21:29.57]Okay, now I remember what I was going with here.
[21:32.17]I made sure to have a completely matching set.
[21:35.19]Right?
[21:36.75]That's what was going through my brain.
[21:43.02]Oh shit.
[21:43.82]Ubercharge goes very fast now.
[21:48.72]It's a clown medic.
[21:49.94]How many medics do we have?
[21:51.34]Two?
[21:52.04]What does he have?
[21:54.92]Are we just going to go bang bang bang out the door?
[21:56.84]I think so.
[22:03.55]That was one of my favorite Ubers to do.
[22:05.45]Everyone gets out the door.
[22:15.92]Shit!
[22:16.30]I thought he needed one hit.
[22:18.16]Alright, back to Demoman.
[22:29.37]We don't need the other medic.
[22:38.74]Mm-hmm.
[22:39.24]I want to use this, though.
[22:45.02]Oh, those blow up faster than they did before.
[22:46.96]Damn it.
[23:03.80]I'm not predicting you very well, am I?
[23:15.00]I can do better than that.
[23:15.92]What the fuck was that?
[23:31.01]Yeah, I think it's time to do the other thing.
[23:32.39]What was the other thing?
[23:34.23]Give me this one.
[23:34.71]I like this one too.
[23:38.74]Let's do stickies.
[23:40.32]Oh, fuck.
[23:40.70]There's a lot of these too.
[23:44.52]My god, it's like wearing diapers again, I swear to god It's a lot to remember This is more my speed I think
[24:21.46]Ooh, my life got saved.

[26:08.33]Is there a dude?
[26:17.12]No guy?

[29:58.04]I haven't played this game in like 17 months.

[30:34.16]You really want me to bring back 2012 Jeremy?
[30:35.35]Ready?

[30:39.15]Always.

[31:18.55]He's getting too close.

[31:45.52]Ow, ow.
[31:48.82]Just getting bit by mosquitoes.
[31:49.97]It's like walking out your door and there's a swarm of mosquitoes.
[31:53.05]You know you're gonna get bit, but you have to go outside.
[31:55.39]You have to go to your car.
[32:08.59]um I feel like we have a lot of snipers we need a medic we do and I want to do crits creek it's been a long time since I've done crits creek I feel like you could take everything I've said so far in this stream and just say you know just cut it with me saying it's been a long time since x been a long time since x you know it's been a long time since x that's gonna be the rest of this stream it's me talking about how the how the how things I've done I haven't done them in a while
[32:37.52]But every now and then I like to check and see how they're doing.
[32:39.34]Well, that's unfortunate.
[32:42.04]Thanks for the... I'll take... No, no, no, no, no.
[32:43.52]It's not.

[33:22.50]That was close.
[33:23.70]That could have ended really poorly.
[33:25.40]Actually, it did end pretty poorly.
[33:29.28]No, I'm not going in that thing.
[33:30.90]That's guaranteed death.
[33:34.32]Come here, come here, come here, come here.

[33:42.26]Just only heal snipers that's like the strategy guys Looks like we got a fight going on up here What happened Oh a sniper It's too much damage
[34:08.57]I almost have it.
[34:09.49]Do we even have any?
[34:10.27]What do we have for classes on this team?
[34:11.59]Alright, there's a couple of demo men.
[34:13.57]Where the hell are they?
[34:14.99]There's one right here.
[34:21.27]Alright, looks like it's going to be you.
[34:31.62]Oh, well.
[34:36.83]I guess that's... Almost got it.
[34:41.49]I'll get it again.
[34:42.07]Don't worry.
[34:42.97]No, I won't.
[34:45.51]Uber the sniper.
[34:51.09]I thought that was going to be two guys on the cart, and then there was people behind, and then... They're actually all snipers.
[35:02.49]Maybe I don't even need to be medic.
[35:06.40]Yes, I have the flog equipped on this.
[35:07.92]You know, if they're going to be snipers, might as well get some fucking shots in, you know what I mean?
[35:16.22]And there are a lot.
[35:17.15]Fuck.
[35:27.27]Just go flog.
[35:40.46]Bad.
[35:41.56]Yeah, I know.
[35:42.20]And I'm taking the teleporter as a scout.
[35:52.92]Jesus Christ.
[35:55.98]What happened?
[36:01.76]Oh my god, I'm still alive.
[36:03.31]See how I baited that?
[36:11.97]Oh, dick!
[36:14.81]There are too many snipers.
[36:15.91]There's laser pointers pointing in every direction.
[36:23.04]By the way, what button did I just press to pull up my backpack?
[36:28.42]It wasn't M. How did I press N?
[36:31.76]Oh, it's because I was pressing space.
[36:35.88]Why was I leaning that far to the right of the space bar?
[36:38.98]It's a panic.
[36:42.42]Oh, fuck.
[36:54.73]Dude, this seriously feels like a joke how many there are.
[36:56.27]This is insane.
[36:56.77]There's too many.
[36:59.99]Like the... I gotta change the name from Murderous Pursuit.
[37:17.31]Go fulfill my destiny as a spy.
[37:33.04]Alright, let's go.
[37:35.98]I'm gonna get a two kill streak.
[37:41.17]Nice try.
[37:47.34]Get out of here.
[37:48.82]Don't embarrass me.
[37:53.94]Oh, I just blew it for that guy.
[37:55.23]I thought he was a spy on their team, not on our team.
[38:17.42]I knew it.
[38:17.68]Oh, I'm dead.
[38:19.74]Just cost chaos until I die.
[38:20.84]I'm dying.
[38:21.70]How am I number one on the team?
[38:23.15]I don't know how that happened.
[38:32.93]Somehow.
[38:34.79]Oh, I got a killstreak.
[38:41.84]It's not fuck it Friday.
[38:44.56]No, it's called stomachache Friday.
[38:47.48]Wednesday I gotta get up there Oh, I had a spy there Just died that would have been ultra embarrassing I
[39:21.08]Oh my god, can I not kill this guy?
[39:27.42]Still won.
[39:27.90]Hey.
[39:38.46]I did it.
[39:39.38]With the team as a whole, we did it.
[39:44.56]Yes, I did say I probably was never going to play TF2 ever again.
[39:47.24]But... I mean...
[39:51.89]It's not necessarily... I don't know.
[39:55.35]I can't tell you what I am and I'm not going to do.
[39:57.13]You know what I mean?
[40:02.00]Because I don't want to ever... Look, I don't want to ever tell anybody I will never do this because, I don't know, I might.
[40:07.70]I might.
[40:08.14]Just don't expect me to do this that often, but it's an old friend.
[40:14.34]You know what I mean?
[40:15.06]TF2 is like an old friend.
[40:16.83]I want to catch up from time to time just to see what they're doing.
[40:21.66]Because regardless of if I play the game, it's still interesting to see what the updates and, you know.
[40:31.97]I want to do, let's do payload and attack defense.
[40:43.00]More Garfield card.
[40:54.79]Updates.
[41:02.76]Maybe like another couple rounds.
[41:03.68]Then I have to go.
[41:06.44]I have to leave.
[41:10.02]I've been dealing with my colitis dog shit.
[41:17.57]And I mean that term pretty absolutely.
[41:21.49]What do I want to do?
[41:23.16]Let me go engineer.
[41:25.76]But let me actually... I've got to do keybinds here.
[41:31.34]Where's my options?
[41:33.44]Keybindings here.
[41:35.36]I need my... Engineer.
[41:40.71]Weapon category 4, is it?
[41:44.17]Is it weapon category 4 and 3 and 4, right?

[42:25.82]I could do this in a second.
[42:28.58]Oh, man.
[42:33.33]I used to be able to do this in five seconds, man.
[42:36.05]This is not a good place for it.
[42:46.62]Try the short circuit.
[42:50.09]Let's put the exit here.
[42:52.03]No, this is not the place.
[42:52.89]I know where the spot is.
[42:57.36]The spot is over at the, uh, in the tunnel.
[43:00.26]From what I remember.
[43:00.94]Don't accidentally get that shit.
[43:06.70]I got a noob spot.
[43:08.90]I just have to remember how to build.
[43:10.26]Alright, I'm gonna move it to the place where I want it to go.
[43:13.66]That's over here.
[43:15.35]And then it fa- Ah, shit!
[43:18.56]Somebody's already in that parking spot.
[43:22.17]Fuck it.
[43:28.46]Good distraction!
[43:48.60]Good Engi.
[43:58.24]Oh, shit, he has crit.
[44:02.40]I could take this off.
[44:04.07]What?
[44:04.73]Four health regenerated per second.
[44:07.19]No flinching?
[44:10.83]Cool.
[44:12.29]That's new.
[44:16.41]The short circuit actually is a fun one.
[44:17.69]I'll look at it after I die again.
[44:22.26]No, don't hit me with that shit.
[44:23.82]Ugh, fucking hell.
[44:28.28]Um... Let me look at the short circuit, huh?
[44:34.71]What?
[44:45.85]How the fuck does that work?
[44:50.87]Is this like the Righteous Bison?
[44:51.85]Does this go through people?
[44:57.59]We're getting kind of stuffed in here.
[45:07.10]Should I shoot somebody with this?
[45:21.17]Is it like the Bison?
[45:29.56]Alright, is that parking spot there?
[45:32.46]Nope.
[45:32.86]Might have to be this guy.
[45:40.73]Alright, I'm going to launch this at somebody.
[45:42.19]I'm going to do the comming...
[45:48.25]A lot of medics.
[45:52.30]We don't have any soldiers.
[45:53.64]Anything new for soldier?
[45:54.52]Anything interesting that they've done?
[45:55.78]I used to love the original.
[45:58.26]Original and we're going to go with the Buff Banner.
[46:04.48]Are these fairly unchanged?
[46:06.78]I didn't even get to see what it does.
[46:20.28]Lord oh my god, let me back in Get rid of the equalizers.
[46:24.77]Is it terrible though?
[46:26.29]Oh shit 90% less healing In 50% this is a fucking new game Holy shit, this everything is new.

[49:30.85]That hurt.
[49:31.51]I'm gonna die.
[49:32.17]This is a... I was gonna call him a meadow man.
[49:38.07]And, like, M-E-A-D-O.
[49:40.19]Like, oh, watch out for the meadow man.
[49:43.01]Like, medic and Demoman mixed together.
[49:52.54]Nice rocket jumps.
[49:53.50]I'm doing fucking well with those jumps.
[49:58.85]Shit, that's not good.
[50:07.65]One minute 20 seconds Holy shit Center down I'm not sure who I'm talking to really good rocket jumps We can do it
[50:44.02]They're everywhere.
[50:44.76]There's too much stuff.
[50:49.32]Oh my goodness.
[50:55.41]What the fuck is happening?
[51:03.15]That was absolute chaos.
[51:04.95]I tried to shoot the blue sentry.
[51:09.92]I tried to kill the blue sentry.
[51:12.46]You're not trying to get the blue, you're trying to get the red, Jeremy.
[51:16.46]That would be nice if you could understand that.
[51:23.67]Gotta just get in there.
[51:27.95]Oh, there's 4,000 people standing there.
[51:29.45]No way.
[51:43.31]That was fun.
[51:47.76]I forgot just how fun TF2 just was to play.
[51:51.24]It just is.
[51:51.64]Oh, Dust Bowl.
[51:53.64]Yes, there we go.
[51:54.48]That's what I'm talking about.
[51:55.30]Let's go to Dust Bowl.
[51:55.94]Everybody vote for Dust Bowl.
[51:56.74]50-50.
[51:57.30]No, somebody click it.
[51:58.62]Why would you do that?
[51:59.24]Why would you go to Mountain Lab?
[52:00.95]Mountain Lab sucks.
[52:03.63]Oh, Mountain Lab is so not cool.
[52:06.01]I would rather play Dust Bowl than Mountain Lab.
[52:08.24]Haunted Houseman comes out in Mountain Lab and cuts your head off.
[52:10.56]No!
[52:16.26]Flip the coin.
[52:26.25]We better be going to Dust Bowl or I'm going to be mad.
[52:30.93]You're already playing... No, but I don't... No, I want to go to Dust Bowl.
[52:33.77]I want to do, like, the beginning Dust Bowl, not, like, the middle Dust Bowl.
[52:36.73]Alright, let's do a little bit of a Shmoip around.
[52:50.30]I want to actually try to play with the Huntsman.
[52:53.14]Not suck at it.
[52:54.36]No, I don't lie.
[52:55.50]I don't want to do that.
[52:58.04]Should I play... Who have I not... Heavy.
[53:00.90]No, let's play Spy.
[53:02.60]How do I play Spy again?
[53:03.60]Okay, it's... That's how you do it.
[53:07.96]And then you got the Kunai.
[53:09.64]The Kunai any good?
[53:12.51]Did they change the nerf to Kunai or anything?
[53:17.21]I guess not.
[53:18.87]Default invisibility watch.
[53:20.85]I mean, I have the duck one.
[53:22.02]Why would I have this on?
[53:26.92]I still have this hat on.
[53:29.52]You guys realize that I never took this off?
[53:37.38]I never took that hat off.
[53:45.35]The way the ambassador sucks now?
[53:48.17]I don't even know.
[53:48.79]I'll just change it to the Locked Out Anger.
[53:57.01]What does the Locked Out Anger do again?
[54:00.85]More cloak.
[54:03.99]Holy shit, this thing is... This is insane.
[54:13.46]Was this this good before?
[54:19.88]What about knives?
[54:21.88]Anything new with knives?
[54:26.65]I... I love the big earner.
[54:32.92]We'll just try this one out.
[54:35.06]Actually, no.
[54:35.42]You know what?
[54:35.70]I want to do the big lethal.
[54:38.12]The big short.
[54:40.86]This is the cloak setup.
[54:41.70]I made a video on this.
[54:44.12]I made a video on this setup and I was like, man, if you want to get a bunch of cloak, this is called the super cloak.
[54:48.56]It gives you so much cloak.
[54:49.46]Cloak.
[54:49.68]It's all about the cloak, man.
[54:51.26]Try the cloak.
[54:52.84]I was all over this.
[55:05.10]Your spy tips were bad?
[55:08.12]My spy tips were good for 2011.
[55:09.56]Oh, come on.
[55:10.86]Come on, man!
[55:11.44]You gotta remember, I made all those videos back before the free-to-play update even came out for TF2.
[55:21.59]This game, you still had to buy this game when I was making videos on it.
[55:34.38]This is so long.
[55:35.26]This is... I'm not used to how long they... Can you bet ammo still?
[55:38.84]Oh my goodness, you can.
[55:52.55]Why do I have the bat out?
[56:04.49]Oh, there's a fucking trick in the book!
[56:09.81]Fuck!
[56:20.69]This ain't gonna go well.
[56:29.51]Why am I walking down Main Street here?
[56:30.81]This is bad.
[56:40.60]I haven't done anything.
[56:41.36]I'm just like walking around the map.
[56:49.30]It's been too long.
[56:50.62]I can't play Spy.
[56:51.72]Not right now.
[56:54.26]No fucking way.
[56:57.00]No, that ship sailed two and a half years ago.
[57:00.86]Not in a fucking million years.
[57:16.16]No, I can't.
[57:17.43]Not on offense.
[57:19.17]Not on this map.
[57:34.76]Shit.
[57:44.46]No, that guy's got a hat.
[57:59.28]Alright, I can move over here.
[58:04.56]No!
[58:05.44]The fledge!
[58:07.35]The fledge!
[58:11.45]Fuck, this guy just keeps lighting me on fire.
[58:13.81]Oh my lord.
[58:30.09]Yeah, we got G. Grossy as the healer.
[58:31.91]That's good.
[58:33.61]The Darwin says no afterburn.
[58:36.84]That's cool.
[58:37.28]I'll have to do that.
[58:44.58]Is it safe?
[58:51.43]Damn it.
[58:58.91]I could feel that one.
[59:01.67]Didn't feel it enough.
[59:09.19]Damn it!
[59:21.69]What's that?
[59:22.95]I heard a noise.
[59:23.47]Is that a spy?
[59:38.81]I can't even see.
[59:43.78]Did they change the way the... Did they change fire?
[59:46.58]Why does the fire look so insane now?
[59:48.00]Fuck.
[60:04.49]Alright, I gotta change to something else.
[60:08.24]The fire... I don't like the new fire.
[60:11.36]Is that new?
[60:12.10]Let's see.
[60:27.41]It's like really super bright.
[60:28.87]I haven't played heavy.
[60:30.49]Let's play heavy.
[60:33.42]Hmm.
[60:38.67]No, we don't have any heavies.
[60:40.65]I kind of have to.
[60:41.33]Let's go default with this new banana that I put on and didn't understand.
[60:50.16]Whatever.
[60:56.80]Pyro has a jetpack?
[60:58.82]Yeah, I saw the jetpack.
[61:00.06]It's pretty cool.
[61:02.85]Put the strange on.
[61:04.09]No, we're going regular.
[61:06.85]What was that?
[61:09.92]What?
[61:10.96]There's a tornado on the map.
[61:12.08]If there's a goddamn tornado, I think something's going wrong.
[61:26.81]That's not good.
[61:27.33]Here it comes.
[61:33.21]I need to, like, get up here.
[61:40.85]Dude, a ghost just shot me.
[61:54.97]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[61:56.11]I'm in trouble.
[61:57.11]I'm dead.
[62:09.66]Where are my unusuals?
[62:10.62]Thank you, Bubble Ass Pickles.
[62:18.23]That's new.
[62:19.41]That's pretty cool, actually.
[62:22.73]Does that block damage?
[62:24.07]No, that would be fucking horrible.
[62:27.08]Why did I think that was a wall?
[62:39.82]There's so many people in there and none of them are dying.
[62:41.83]Oh, well.
[62:56.85]It's bass?
[62:59.05]Or is it bass or bass?
[63:08.86]I got one.
[63:14.74]Where the hell did you come from?
[63:21.30]Fuck that.
[63:21.70]I'm going this way.
[63:22.30]No, no, no.
[63:23.74]No, I'm not.
[63:24.35]No, I'm not.
[63:43.62]No, you can't shoot me from there.
[63:45.48]See, now they're all focusing over here and my teammates will go... I just... Complete the banana.
[63:58.85]Oh, I guess I was getting points.
[64:00.61]Alright.
[64:02.35]Fuck the default.
[64:03.21]Give me, like, the beast.
[64:05.45]Take this off, too.
[64:06.07]Oh, you can heal your friends.
[64:10.15]Okay.
[64:10.61]And what is this?
[64:16.04]Why would I ever not have these on?
[64:23.78]Brass Beast, is it bad?
[64:24.92]Look at this.
[64:30.65]I got a banana.
[64:32.17]See?
[64:33.29]Does that mean I'm... Oh, I'm getting points for that.
[64:35.23]That's cool.
[64:36.75]Look at how many heavies we have.
[64:45.31]Hmm, where's this entry?
[64:50.11]No!
[64:50.77]You've ruined it!
[64:51.41]Fuck all of you in the corner, then.
[64:56.53]Oh, there's one up there, too.
[64:59.71]No, there's not.
[65:00.77]Yeah, there is.
[65:08.50]Soiled it.
[65:21.94]Tomislav has always been the best.
[65:30.21]They still haven't made the Tomislav not the best.
[65:31.81]You got to make this worse.
[65:37.81]No, I'm staying with the... I was going to say something else.
[65:49.08]Let's sneak up here.
[65:51.47]And then down hold on that world Oh my god Why their World of Warcraft like bounties like feasts not bounties uh buffets I think we have too many heavies This time let's try pyro I'm gonna go no flog we're doing
[66:20.37]Let's do the genuine no stromo.
[66:23.83]This whole gas thing was cool.
[66:26.49]I want the shotgun, though.
[66:27.35]I want the cool shotgun.
[66:28.51]The factory new shotgun.
[66:35.66]That is so strange.
[66:38.36]It actually looks like real fire.
[66:44.42]I don't like it.
[67:00.17]Look at those graphics.
[67:07.13]It's hard to see through.
[67:09.49]It just, it feels too much.
[67:12.07]Drop that opacity by, like, 15-20% and you got me.
[67:18.82]Yeah, you can just, yeah, you can, these are all things that are easily changed.
[67:23.00]I forgot this is TF2.
[67:23.88]You can, like, replace anything.
[67:36.26]Nobody came out.
[67:38.21]Why are you doing this to me?
[67:40.87]You don't want to do this to me.
[67:56.66]Replace the particle with glue man emotes.
[68:03.52]Use the new flamethrower.
[68:05.46]This thing's weird, man.
[68:07.98]This thing is like, one, two, three, four, five.
[68:15.07]Official Jax accidental reflect.
[68:18.03]No, it wasn't.
[68:18.57]He was a soldier.
[68:19.37]I know what I'm doing.
[68:21.03]Come on, man.
[68:22.45]I know what I'm doing.
[68:25.73]Nope, not going down there.
[68:29.08]Oh, not going down there.
[68:34.92]It's a flame shotgun.
[68:37.10]That's cool.
[68:44.64]They gave Pyro a long fireball shooter.
[68:49.98]And when you hit somebody, you can do it again faster.
[68:52.93]And if you hit somebody that's on fire already, it does a mini crit.
[68:57.17]Is that a lie?
[68:58.15]It might be.
[69:08.07]Go up and find him.
[69:15.82]Get him.
[69:25.76]What?
[69:27.35]Oh, it was the sniper.
[69:28.53]If it don't, you'll wave at me.
[69:39.86]How many times have I gone?
[69:40.80]What?
[69:41.58]Huh?
[69:41.96]What?
[69:44.22]What?
[69:55.61]Oh, I almost just got ruined.
[69:57.65]Almost just got ruined.
[69:58.89]My nose is itchy.
[70:00.67]Oh, there's a lot of people.
[70:04.63]Almost just got ruined.
[70:12.03]Is that not hitting him?
[70:14.35]Okay.
[70:15.35]How does this thing work?
[70:20.84]Jeremy, use the new weapon, they said.
[70:22.54]I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[70:27.04]How am I still alive?
[70:28.93]Why have I not died?
[70:41.10]Use a shared pressure tank primary and alt fire Launches a fast moving projectile that briefly ignites enemies Alt fire is air blast This deals a bunch okay, so it's 300 more damage to burning players 50 repressurization on hit Interesting, okay
[71:19.39]I love how, yeah, it's literally a fucking paragraph.
[71:26.69]This is an essay.
[71:27.73]I'll put on the rocket thing.
[71:39.60]Oh, Egypt.
[71:41.34]Egypt.
[71:42.00]Sure.
[71:46.26]The 300% stacks with crits and it's fucking insane.
[71:55.00]Are you serious?
[71:56.24]So hold on a second.
[71:56.84]So that means that if you hit somebody with that, that does... So crits are what?
[72:00.92]250%?
[72:00.94]200%?
[72:01.04]Or is it 300% for crits?
[72:04.29]I forget.
[72:06.59]So that does like almost 200 damage a hit if you light somebody on fire.
[72:19.58]So that does 600% more damage if you have crits and somebody is lit on fire.
[72:28.93]I have to assume there's probably a lot of people that use that item, and they are just infuriatingly unstoppable with it.
[72:38.95]I want to use it again.
[72:44.28]It doesn't stack like that?
[72:45.34]Let me get inside my D.Va.
[72:50.08]D.Va!
[72:53.01]It actually is D.Va.
[72:55.59]But not.
[72:57.81]Why am I making an Overwatch reference?
[73:06.66]What is the hit scan on it, Lyco?
[73:08.22]Not the hit scan.
[73:08.76]What's the hitbox on it?
[73:16.32]So is this based on where you're looking?
[73:18.50]Or is it just a standalone... Let's see.
[73:23.89]Alright, so it's based on where you're facing.
[73:27.23]Taunt
[73:28.58]With the jetpack.
[73:36.10]Oh.
[73:40.30]What's going on?
[73:40.99]Oh, that's not what I wanted.
[73:43.79]Jetpack.
[73:44.65]Taunt.
[73:50.15]Oh, God.
[73:53.86]Let me guess.
[73:54.28]That's a taunt kill, huh?
[73:58.85]Activate Jex this round?
[74:00.27]I'm not sure I can.
[74:05.87]Rocket Jumping Pyros.
[74:07.19]That's something I've never thought I'd ever see.
[74:13.67]Oh, farts.
[74:15.03]Oh, you see that fart?
[74:19.94]Did they add any new weapons?
[74:21.20]Or is it just the three Pyro items?
[74:22.92]Oh, no, not three.
[74:25.07]Yes, so this three pyro items is the gas can, the thing that I made up four years ago.
[74:30.75]Remember that?
[74:34.79]Remember that?
[74:35.09]Remember the gas can thing that I made up fucking four years ago?
[74:38.03]Holy shit, this thing is cool.
[74:56.49]Well, they couldn't even get out.
[74:57.45]What about this way?
[75:11.14]Oh, shit.
[75:11.90]Get me out.
[75:13.82]Get me out!
[75:16.40]How does this thing work?
[75:22.19]Of course.
[75:31.29]yeah I said I wanted a gas can that like you could ignite and that would be oil that people would go in and it would make do yeah I I talked about that's what I wanted for a pyro item I saved the sniper's life yeah I just walked in front of a bullet or an arrow to be more exact I knew it I could I fucking smelled him
[76:03.71]I was like, what the fuck is happening?
[76:05.35]Why is this guy here?
[76:16.36]Show proof or pre-recorded?
[76:17.92]I mean, the proof is pre-recorded.
[76:19.72]It's a video on my YouTube channel.
[76:22.92]There is pre-recordings.
[76:25.79]Why am I even calling it a pre-recording?
[76:27.45]Like, please.
[76:29.15]Stop it.
[76:29.93]Why?
[76:30.21]Why?
[76:31.60]Oh my god.
[76:33.07]Alright, this is a cool item, but I have to play something else.
[76:34.87]I'm going to play as the... Engineer.
[76:39.03]With a regular sentry gun.
[76:42.33]And I'll use the short circuit for fun.
[76:44.01]What the hell am I going to use for a wrench?
[76:47.61]Is this thing... This is too long.
[76:49.33]Didn't read.
[76:49.73]Give me the hospitality.
[76:53.99]What is this?
[76:54.43]Oh.
[76:55.95]They have a new... No.
[77:00.23]What's a good spot for this?
[77:03.46]There, back here, right?
[77:07.26]God damn it.
[77:07.90]I don't even fucking know.
[77:09.84]Oh, fuck me.
[77:10.46]Where am I going?
[77:11.76]Oh, man.
[77:12.26]What am I doing?
[77:13.76]What?
[77:14.32]Alright.
[77:14.92]Alright.
[77:15.40]That, like... That guy's got a magnet to my body.
[77:21.35]Right here?
[77:21.63]Is this a good spot?
[77:26.41]I don't know.
[77:27.01]I really don't know where the spot is.
[77:28.95]Right here?
[77:32.69]I just don't know.
[77:33.83]I don't know.
[77:34.29]I have no idea.
[77:36.11]My god.
[77:37.48]No, it's like back there.
[77:39.54]Look, no one's going to expect some fucking idiot to have this entry right here.
[77:42.68]Trust me.
[77:44.24]See?
[77:44.34]Give me items.
[78:00.59]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[78:02.61]I have to watch my own TF2 tutorial videos.
[78:14.46]Yeah, that's in a good spot.
[78:16.74]Take a look.
[78:17.18]And it's got two kills.
[78:19.16]Three kills now.
[78:23.31]Remember, be a fellow engineer.
[78:29.72]See what I'm doing here?
[78:32.73]What about mine?
[78:45.30]Does the guy even have a dispenser?
[78:46.50]I don't think you even have a dispenser.
[78:50.42]Yeah, take this.
[78:51.04]You need this.
[79:01.01]God, now I... This game is fun.
[79:04.05]What a fun game.
[79:07.71]Valve, why don't you care anymore?
[79:15.28]Spy, somewhere.
[79:19.78]Oh, fuck.
[79:24.80]Thank God that Engineer is an Engineer friend.
[79:30.57]I wish Valve would make, like, another game.
[79:33.59]You know what I mean?
[79:39.41]I got an accolade?
[79:40.27]What the hell did I do?
[79:44.63]Oh, shit.
[79:45.39]Oh, yeah, you're in deep shit, because now I got six critical strikes.
[79:50.19]Who cares?
[79:50.71]Just put it anywhere.
[79:52.23]I used to love this.
[79:52.81]This is my favorite part about playing the Engineer.
[79:58.70]I just lagged.
[79:59.72]Lag!
[80:25.38]Lag.
[80:32.57]Yeah.
[80:35.69]Let's go over here with this.
[80:40.21]Okay.
[80:43.58]Are you just gonna come up here?
[80:45.32]I guess you are.
[80:47.00]Alright, well, whatever.
[80:47.82]Fat guy, get out of the way!
[80:50.52]Ugh, fuck.
[80:56.64]I'm surprised I got all six shots off before dying.
[80:59.06]What are they making now?
[81:04.21]They're making like a card game like seven years too late.
[81:14.30]I wouldn't be surprised if Valve decided that they were going to make like a Battlegrounds game.
[81:25.37]What the fuck, man?
[81:26.57]Can I not get anything done here?
[81:35.46]Yeah, like Hearthstone came out and everybody loved that game and then like four years went by and then Valve was like, we gotta get on that!
[81:58.27]I'm going to do one more.
[82:00.22]One more and then I'm going to call it a night because I need to go take a break.
[82:05.58]My stomach is turning upside down.
[82:09.74]So let's do this last one as... I'm going to do a demo with... How did they change this at all?
[82:24.26]No, I don't want to place that.
[82:25.16]Let's play as...
[82:28.69]I'm just so torn.
[82:29.93]I just don't know what to even play.
[82:31.23]Because there's so many options in TF2, and there's so many loadouts.
[82:33.99]I just can't pick one because I'm awful at all of them now.
[82:40.28]So I can roll the dice and pick a random loadout that I'm going to be equally as awful with the last one.
[82:47.28]I'm going to go back to Pyro.
[82:48.98]I mean, this is the new shit.
[82:49.82]I want to play with it a little more.
[82:50.95]Where's the gas can?
[82:53.49]What is this thing?
[82:56.43]Creates a horrific visible gas cloud that coats enemies.
[83:01.25]So if they walk into that and they take damage, they light on fire.
[83:07.21]So it's like having Jurati or the Mad Milk.
[83:12.04]But instead of healing or mini-crits, damage makes them ignite.
[83:16.70]Okay, interesting.
[83:24.50]Oh, I'm dead.
[83:28.29]Pyros can light on fire too That changes things a little Doesn't make them on fire makes them more flammable.
[83:43.63]Well, if they're coated and they get shot do they light on fire by like a bullet I
[84:00.63]What do you do air blasting?
[84:01.89]Alright, I have it.
[84:04.17]Let's see what it does.
[84:04.75]Alright, so it's just a can.
[84:08.17]And, um... Well, good job.
[84:13.10]Good work.
[84:15.12]The important thing is you tried.
[84:16.30]Ow.
[84:22.52]Ow.
[84:27.68]Ow.
[84:33.46]Oh yeah, man versus machine.
[84:34.69]There's like these new items.
[84:45.59]Shoot me.
[84:49.32]No, you're not a bad guy.
[84:52.16]Alright, let's try this again.
[84:57.86]Didn't really have a good indicator there.
[85:03.56]That spy is going to backstab me in three seconds.
[85:05.64]He's following me up here.
[85:23.25]It's like Jurati that lingers.
[85:37.29]Seems like kind of slow So it's only it's no wait a minute it's based on damage So the more damage that I do the more it fills so it's kind of like a flog it's a gas can flog that Puts a flammable liquid on people and it sits there like a gas for a little while What in the fucking name of God just happened I
[86:07.99]Was I the spy?
[86:08.87]Did I just de-cloak in the middle of the game?
[86:14.97]Alright, well... I just de-cloaked.
[86:19.53]I just World of Warcraft phased into a different instance.
[86:40.02]Oh, that's a coating.
[86:40.90]That's a good coating.
[86:42.20]Oh!
[86:51.82]You had to pop your uber, didn't you?
[86:54.79]Oh, you lucky bastard.
[86:56.99]You are so good as a medic.
[86:58.07]What a good medic.
[86:58.83]You just saved like two or three people.
[87:06.43]The soldier took damage by rocket jumping.
[87:23.08]Somebody's cheatin'.
[87:25.54]Who?
[87:28.34]I can't reflect that, can I?
[87:43.97]Fuck, I thought I- I got crit.
[87:48.50]I got three people.
[87:53.27]This thing is really fun.
[87:57.76]That is really fun.
[88:00.78]Accused of scamming.
[88:06.37]What happened?
[88:10.13]I didn't have a chance to vote.
[88:24.00]Did I get it?
[88:24.36]Ugh, no.
[88:28.62]I'm not doing so well.
[88:42.47]Ugh.
[88:44.77]I think we're gonna lose here.
[88:46.81]Maybe not.
[88:49.55]Mmm... Yes, we are.
[88:53.67]Quick, do a taunt or something.
[89:02.29]Alright.
[89:02.61]I'm going to wrap it up here.
[89:04.07]What did I get?
[89:06.75]I got something?
[89:08.49]If you were playing, thanks for playing.
[89:11.19]What's this?
[89:11.53]Are you serious?
[89:15.61]This is new.
[89:23.59]It's the amount of random lines of code that they've added.
[89:32.14]Alright, I'm going to wrap it up.
[89:33.86]Sorry I'm not going that long tonight.
[89:36.88]Just having stomach issues.
[89:38.64]Wanted to go for at least like three or four hours though, so.
[89:44.41]But hey, tonight was pretty fun.
[89:46.97]I played Garfield Kart.
[89:51.12]played that boat game.
[89:53.24]I liked that game as much as I didn't like a few pieces of it.
[89:59.78]I want to look at something though before I end the stream.
[90:02.06]Where is it?
[90:05.36]Mercenary Park Gift Shop.
[90:10.22]Some of this stuff is just so foreign to me.
[90:15.03]Mercenary Pack.
[90:16.77]Maps.
[90:22.85]there are like a hundred contracts so to do these 108 contracts I need this pass that is the only way open a crate do I have any keys I don't think I even have any keys guys key I don't have any keys I can't open any of these crates
[90:54.62]The Mercenary Pack contracts are really fun.
[90:58.91]Tons of new maps.
[91:03.03]Buy a key.
[91:04.19]I'm not going to buy a key right now.
[91:08.41]Blue Moon Cosmetic Collection.
[91:10.45]It's only $5.
[91:10.81]You really want to buy a fucking key?
[91:19.30]What am I, need two keys?
[91:20.98]This is fucking like... This is... This is...
[91:25.07]I might not open this game for, like, another year.
[91:26.85]Alright.
[91:32.12]Hold on a second.
[91:32.78]I think I just got, like, scammed.
[92:04.04]I apparently can't do it.
[92:08.05]What about this?
[92:09.51]No.
[92:11.37]No.
[92:14.61]No, I don't have it.
[92:15.95]I can't connect to the Steam store or something for some reason.
[92:26.44]It just says connecting to store.
[92:30.46]I'll prove it to you.
[92:33.42]You want the proof?
[92:34.75]Here.
[92:37.15]Where is it?
[92:37.57]I'm saying you gotta get a key.
[92:49.72]Can't do anything.
[92:56.58]Liar!
[93:03.14]Go to the actual store.
[93:04.68]Oh my lord.
[93:05.38]Hold on.

[93:26.52]I'm out.
[93:27.94]I'm not buying cosmetics.
[93:29.24]I'm not buying keys.
[93:31.45]Not community market.
[93:32.43]I'm not buying keys.
[93:35.67]That's going to be it, guys.
[93:37.28]Sorry for the less than like four hour stream tonight.
[93:41.92]We'll pick up where we left off.
[93:43.32]Nothing on Thursday and Friday.
[93:44.64]I got some stuff going on.
[93:45.52]I can't.
[93:48.14]I can't stream on Thursday and Friday, but we're going to do Saturday and Sunday.
[93:51.48]Should be fun.
[93:52.93]We'll have some fun stuff going on this weekend.
[93:57.81]Hope you enjoy.
[93:59.05]Should be interesting.
[94:01.40]and with that uh take care we're gonna run the credits sometimes we check up on our old friends Team Fortress that was cool I I enjoyed that it's just a fun game interesting to see the new items I do similar stuff with like I don't like play smite at all like anymore like at all
[94:29.93]But I will still, from time to time, go check out what the new god is.
[94:33.53]Just because.
[94:34.37]Just because.
[94:36.47]It's cool.
[94:38.53]Anyways, let's do the credits.
[94:40.53]The stream is not starting soon.
[94:41.71]The stream, in fact, is ending.

[97:38.51]Now let's move on to the bits.
[97:40.40]See you on Saturday.
[97:42.22]I'm going to reiterate it one more time.
[97:44.32]See you Saturday.
[97:46.26]Let's do the bits from earlier.
[97:48.40]We had Snooze and Copter earlier for $1.
[97:50.48]Thank you, dude.
[97:51.68]Was watching last stream's VOD when something, or better, someone, scared the insides out of me.
[97:57.12]A person named Snooze gave bits and it wasn't me.
[98:00.45]I thought I might have donated while sleepwalking.
[98:02.97]But then I remembered I don't sleep.
[98:04.43]But when I find out who messes with my identity, I swear I'm sorry I lost it there.
[98:08.71]Turn to play the new God of War.
[98:09.91]It's really good.
[98:14.64]I actually probably will.
[98:17.66]I don't know if I'll stream it though.
[98:19.56]I might have missed the boat on that.
[98:21.58]Is that game still watchable?
[98:22.98]Is that like a watchable game that a lot of people will want to watch?
[98:26.90]Or is that sort of... If you wanted to stream it, you should have done it like the first couple days.
[98:32.57]And the people that haven't seen it yet don't want to watch it.
[98:36.33]Because they want to play it themselves.
[98:38.69]I don't know.
[98:38.95]It's one of those kind of situations.
[98:41.69]Maybe I'll do that.
[98:42.87]Probably next week, then.
[98:43.87]Because there's a couple of planned streams here this weekend, so... Can't really do it this weekend.
[98:50.88]But anyways, thank you SmellyBoy for the 10.
[98:53.58]That's a 10 and then a 0, so $1.
[98:55.14]Why are you playing this?
[98:57.96]I think they were talking about Garfield's card.
[98:59.32]I don't know.
[99:03.17]It's because I was a highly requested game.
[99:05.27]Thank you PurpleRoseTattoo for the $1.
[99:07.07]I don't know how it happened, but you and GiantBomb are playing Garfield's games at the same time.
[99:14.59]Small world, I guess.
[99:17.87]Emperor Zoran, thanks for the 25 cents.
[99:19.71]Random fact.
[99:21.75]Abraham Lincoln, as a 21-year-old in 1830, was the wrestling champion of his county in Illinois.
[99:28.81]He lost only one recorded match in his wrestling career.
[99:34.45]Well, that's actually... Alright.
[99:40.62]Here you go, Abe.
[99:43.06]StreamyDoodle, thanks for the $1.
[99:44.50]Bad stream.
[99:46.78]What?
[99:49.50]I played Garfield's cart.
[99:52.26]That was going on during Garfield's cart.
[99:54.94]That was told that was a bad stream during Garfield's cart.
[99:59.00]You do realize that there were 2,500 people here concurrently.
[100:06.49]I would say at some point, out of the 2,500 people that were here, maybe 900 of you
[100:12.77]told me to play Garfield's cart.
[100:15.49]At some point over the last, like, three months.
[100:19.41]So, you're gonna blame, you're gonna blame, like, the 30 to 40 percent of every person that's here.
[100:24.75]I'm, I'm sorry.
[100:26.87]I, I, I, I am a man of the people.
[100:32.81]There were more viewers for Garfield's cart than TF2.
[100:38.20]More people told me to play Doki Doki.
[100:40.18]Yeah, but, like,
[100:42.19]Why would I do that?
[100:47.01]I can't play that game because I already know that it's one of those games where... Shh, shh, shh, don't tell him.
[100:52.65]Shh.
[100:54.03]Shh, don't tell him.
[100:56.21]Oh no, something happened.
[100:57.53]It's not what I thought it was.
[101:00.25]You know?
[101:01.61]But thank you for the $1 streamer doodle.
[101:03.03]Thank you, Niall Orion, for the $1.
[101:04.61]Hey, Dad, are you playing Murderous Pursuits in a private lobby or can I join?
[101:08.69]Ah, fuck.
[101:09.13]I'm sorry.
[101:09.51]I missed that.
[101:10.85]There were only like 40 people playing.
[101:12.31]I would have partied up.
[101:14.80]I don't know.
[101:15.58]What if you stream snipered me, though?
[101:16.76]I don't know if I would have liked that.
[101:18.80]I had a stream sniper.
[101:19.78]I had a couple of stream snipers snipe me.
[101:23.98]Hydrate.
[101:24.42]I will.
[101:24.74]Don't worry.
[101:29.28]Thanks, Little.
[101:29.80]Thank you, High Lord Nameless, for the 40 cents.
[101:31.86]jermaMustard Party.
[101:33.60]Where's the Jerma merch?
[101:36.98]This summer is going to be weird.
[101:38.36]There's going to be a lot of random shit this summer.
[101:42.73]You'll see.
[101:43.07]Stay tuned.
[101:44.03]Thank you, Gator Head, for the 25 cents.
[101:45.89]That Doki Doki bait and switch was worth a quarter.
[101:48.65]Thank you.
[101:50.23]Emperor Zoran, again, thanks for the 25 cents.
[101:51.93]Random fact.
[101:54.18]Jerma, half the team was stream sniping you.
[101:59.18]And I still got in like second and third place most of the time.
[102:01.91]Come on.
[102:03.37]That game was fun.
[102:04.85]I'll probably never play it again, but that was a good fun two to three hours.
[102:07.85]That was a fun two hours.
[102:09.15]What is this?
[102:09.51]I'm a month late for April Fools.
[102:12.21]What is this?
[102:14.39]Okay, let's open the next game.
[102:15.90]You didn't think I was prepared for this.
[102:18.34]Okay.
[102:18.82]There it comes.
[102:28.60]Oh, this is... Just kidding.
[102:30.62]That was a fucking YouTube video.
[102:32.90]Oh, got ya.
[102:35.02]Thanks, man.
[102:36.24]Wait, I... Who... Nobody sent that in a bit.
[102:40.24]I just clicked it in chat.
[102:44.95]Thank you, Gatorhead.
[102:45.59]Thank you, Emperor Zoran, for the 25 cents.
[102:47.15]Random fact.
[102:47.71]Contrary to what Hollywood likes showing in movies, velociraptors were actually very small.
[102:52.21]They were only slightly larger than chickens.
[102:57.52]Yeah, that's true.
[102:58.06]That's weird.
[102:59.80]Hey, there's a... Camera adds 25 pounds, man.
[103:03.50]Raph Mouse, thanks for the $1.
[103:05.20]Play Bloodborne card.
[103:07.74]I'll wait till all the DLC is out.
[103:11.12]Stormy Chu, thanks for the $50 you gave earlier.
[103:13.10]Much appreciated, man.
[103:15.74]You gave... $50 fucking dollars.
[103:18.80]A lot of money, man.
[103:21.97]Also, an Adam gave 50 cents.
[103:23.69]jermaSnort.
[103:24.95]You've just been visited by the elusive dabbing Jerma.
[103:27.81]Hearty snorts and a healthy hairline will come your way.
[103:30.97]But only if you type dab on compact streamer.
[103:33.85]jermaSnort.
[103:36.77]I'll allow it.
[103:38.67]Cookie in between their extremely generous $150 says, here's money, you tall man, for $1.
[103:45.87]Thank you, man.
[103:51.42]And thank you to your additional $150 over the course of the night.
[103:56.55]Thank you.
[103:58.47]Snooze and Copter again here with $1.
[103:59.89]Oh yeah, by the way, you should probably schedule a week or so for God of War.
[104:03.91]Okay, that's all.
[104:04.51]I'm off getting new bits now.
[104:08.59]Yeah, I've been told it's about like a 25 to 35 hour experience.
[104:14.83]We'll see.
[104:17.19]Thanks, though.
[104:19.95]Thank you also to Penny Kettle for the 26 cents.
[104:24.89]If you move to Nevada, your iconic accent might fade away.
[104:28.84]At first, this seems like a funny thought, but it could actually damage your stream appeal.
[104:32.68]Get a voice coach.
[104:34.92]No, that's not gonna happen.
[104:39.62]You think I'm gonna get like a Nevada accent?
[104:42.16]How do they talk in Nevada?
[104:43.90]They talk like this?
[104:48.00]I mean, I might get a little bit of a... I'll get a Boston accent southern twang.
[104:52.42]You know, I'll keep a lot of my accent, but there'll still be a Boston accent in there.
[104:59.33]And it'll just sound real, real weird sometimes.
[105:03.25]Hey, why don't you go park the car over in that Harvard yard?
[105:05.65]That hurts to do that.
[105:10.73]They talk like California dudes.
[105:12.07]Well, that's fine.
[105:14.94]They just sound like a Cajun.
[105:18.65]Nevada Jerma is the worst Jerma.
[105:27.85]I sound like a high school play actor.
[105:32.35]If your accent goes, so do I, loser.
[105:35.20]It's not gonna happen.
[105:36.12]Guys, I don't talk to people.
[105:40.22]You think I'm gonna, like, absorb an accent from Nevada?
[105:44.64]You're implying that I talk to fucking other humans.
[105:49.05]What?
[105:50.49]Oh yeah, I can't wait to go to like local karaoke night in Nevada and absorb an accent from a bunch of fucking new friends.
[105:58.67]What?
[105:58.85]Uh, somebody just said this stream sucks.
[106:05.29]I want that person banned for life.
[106:14.81]You're a young impressionable man.
[106:16.61]Not anymore.
[106:28.42]Alien streamer avoids human contact to maintain cover.
[106:32.12]I wouldn't be surprised if I was an alien.
[106:36.41]You know, wouldn't shock my mother, you know what I mean?
[106:40.87]She's always thought I was kind of weird.
[106:43.33]But that's implying that my mother is not an alien.
[106:45.31]No, there's a lot of implication there.
[106:48.96]My mother did not... There's no alien in the family here.
[106:56.86]Never mind.
[106:58.64]Thank you, Rogue Fort, for the 25 cents.
[107:04.71]Hey, Jerma, sorry I missed your last two streams, but glad I came back to something so creative.
[107:10.21]Uh... What were we playing?
[107:11.23]Oh, we were playing that.
[107:12.05]Speaking of creative, the game I have for you today is exactly that.
[107:15.30]Deadbolt is a 2D stealth action hybrid where you play as the Reaper trying to code the recent uprising of the dead.
[107:21.44]It's painfully hard, which to us watching translates to painfully funny to watch.
[107:25.54]Graphics leave much to be desired.
[107:27.90]That's my last game recommendation.
[107:29.50]Hope you enjoy them all.
[107:31.25]Thank you, Rogue.
[107:34.05]Sellout.
[107:38.09]You know what I just thought?
[107:40.24]If you were... Honest to God.
[107:41.92]Alright, so there's... There's like 1,500 people here right now.
[107:45.38]Wait, like 1,300 people?
[107:47.46]If you just went to like a stream and just gave... You know, you knew that the streamer read bits.
[107:53.58]Like, why pay thousands of fucking dollars for them to play your game and talk about your game when you can just send them a quarter and just have them read what I just did?
[108:03.72]And then go, oh, thanks, man.
[108:07.01]That's some next level marketing there.
[108:09.56]Somewhere in there.
[108:10.32]Cheap.
[108:16.52]Chat pulled together donations to do a sponsored stream.
[108:22.37]I think that actually would be pretty funny.
[108:25.57]Imagine if you guys had to hit a goal for me to like play Doki Doki Literature Club and it was like five grand.
[108:34.06]And I put in, like, the title of that stream.
[108:36.56]Like, uh, sponsored by, like, chat.
[108:39.39]But then that would be, then people would just think I was being lame.
[108:42.45]Like, no, man, I'm sponsored by my community.
[108:44.93]I'm, like, people would think I was on a pedestal.
[108:46.87]It would have to be something else.
[108:49.19]You guys have to, could you guys make, like, a company?
[108:58.10]That would happen in two hours.
[109:00.64]High IQ sellout.
[109:04.99]It's a free game Have like a ticker on the bottom like time to reach like amount of donation to reach Doki Doki If chat donates 5k we get the stream key for 10 minutes
[109:31.77]My god.
[109:33.35]I would be banned for life.
[109:34.51]I would never be able to come back.
[109:38.46]You're telling me that you don't think that somebody would get that stream key and put like two horses fucking each other on screen?
[109:47.61]Are you serious?
[109:49.21]I would be banned in a second.
[109:50.39]It would take five seconds.
[110:00.52]so true yeah that I'm just telling you exactly what's what would happen oh yeah here's my stream key everybody I get kicked off and all of a sudden there's like why is that the go-to scenario I don't know like I did I did I make this joke with you guys or did I make it like in private
[110:28.91]I definitely made this in private.
[110:30.18]No, never mind.
[110:30.66]I definitely talked about this in private with somebody.
[110:32.58]I was like, how could you get banned as fast as possible?
[110:35.98]Like, as fast as possible.
[110:37.58]Like, no joking around.
[110:40.36]What's the fastest, like, your stream turns on, and when are you banned?
[110:45.46]Like, less than 30 seconds, less than a minute.
[110:51.35]And I came up with...
[110:56.87]But you can't stream a video.
[110:59.23]You can't stream a video, and you can't, like, stream violence, like you being hurt, or you, you know, you can't, none of that.
[111:05.72]But, like, what could you do?
[111:10.32]You would just, like, have to be naked.
[111:15.34]But what about if you couldn't be naked?
[111:23.34]That's okay.
[111:28.22]Probably wave your dick around.
[111:29.90]Oh, alright.
[111:30.88]Okay.
[111:31.18]Alright.
[111:32.72]Let's move on here.
[111:33.50]I don't even know why I brought that up.
[111:37.21]But haven't people done that and they didn't get banned for life?
[111:45.25]There are people that have been done wicked, gross, fucked up shit and they like aren't banned for life.
[111:56.65]Just break all the rules at the same time.
[111:58.25]Oh my god.
[112:14.69]Anyways, thank you 2003 Matt for the 25 cents.
[112:17.09]Hey, Jeremy.
[112:17.51]Hey, man.
[112:19.82]Hole of one zombie.
[112:20.48]Thanks for the one dollar hole of one zombie.
[112:23.65]This is going towards your clown horn fund, so you can sit in your basement alone and honk.
[112:29.01]Thanks.
[112:30.19]Thank you, Benny Jet, for the five bucks.
[112:32.61]They just say, cheer 500.
[112:34.07]Thanks, man.
[112:35.41]Penny Kettle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[112:36.73]If you do genuinely want a game suggestion thread, ask a mod to sticky one on Reddit, because currently there's no place for suggestions.
[112:43.58]I'd love to see you play Infamous 2.
[112:45.18]Also, enable MonkaS right now.
[112:49.52]BabyRage.
[112:52.49]Is that the emote that conveys, like, this emotion?
[112:55.53]Like... Right?
[112:57.65]Oh, boy.
[113:03.57]That's like the, whoa, like, yikes.
[113:06.11]Right?
[113:09.67]Yeah.
[113:17.27]No, I'm not gonna... Why would I enable that?
[113:22.12]It already is enabled.
[113:25.85]Somebody just did it.
[113:30.07]You have to get it on Better twitch.tv.
[113:32.17]It's already there.
[113:37.18]We need a Jerm of replacement.
[113:39.96]No, I'm not doing that.
[113:42.14]The easiest emotes you can make are take a popular emote and just make it your face instead.
[113:48.21]That's like the, hmm, what do I do for emotes?
[113:51.49]Well, okay, I'll do my own what face.
[113:53.73]I'll do my own PogChamp.
[113:55.19]I'll do my own dance game.
[113:56.77]I'll do, and I'm gonna, by the way, I'm gonna call them like dance game.
[114:00.46]I'm gonna call them like something champ.
[114:03.04]I'm just gonna put it as my face instead.
[114:20.44]That's the way it works, guys.
[114:22.97]I have five emotes of your face.
[114:26.61]Uh, sorry, I need to correct you here.
[114:29.27]I have one... I have two emotes of my face.
[114:36.10]The rest are planets.
[114:38.34]Taken from the NASA website.
[114:43.98]Two pictures of my face.
[114:46.08]One of which I was forced to upload.
[114:51.82]The rest are our actual telescope images.
[115:01.26]They're on my face.
[115:03.57]They just look like me somehow.
[115:06.03]That's why I'm like... When I was born, the doctor was like, holy shit, that looks like Jupiter!
[115:12.33]And they looked out the window and they saw Jupiter in the distance.
[115:14.37]They were like, wow, it really does.
[115:17.23]I can't help that.
[115:17.91]That's just what the fucking planets look like.
[115:27.81]Hey, Demilkmaster, thanks for the $1.
[115:29.33]Holy shit, he finally played Garfield's card.
[115:31.62]I did.
[115:33.00]Yeah, speaking of Garfield, Garfield the Monday Killer gave 25 cents.
[115:37.12]Thanks for healing Woodstock of his fatal disease with your Fonzie Bear impression.
[115:41.60]Turns out Fonzie has an Italian uncle named Fosarelli.
[115:47.52]So it turns out Fonzie Bear is indeed a real Muppet.
[115:50.58]Look it up.
[115:53.31]No.
[115:53.43]What are you talking about?
[115:56.75]Fonzie Bear.
[116:00.15]It's not real.
[116:02.57]Fozzarelli.
[116:10.44]Fozzarelli is like a car company.
[116:21.34]And they say, Garfield wink.
[116:22.42]Thanks, man.
[116:23.82]Uh-oh.
[116:23.98]Ugh.

[117:20.29]Thank you, Roguefort, for the 25 cents.

[117:33.54]Holy crap, guys.
[117:34.15]Did you guys hear Dermot say, I'm going to play TF2 every day now?
[117:36.99]He just said it.
[117:40.03]Yep.
[117:41.52]Hey BroLuck, thanks for the five bucks, so what's your first impressions of TF2?
[117:46.99]Uh, I don't like the guy that can go invisible.
[117:49.93]I don't- I don't get that, that's like so OP.
[117:53.01]A guy just like can go invisible and change his like disguise and change characters and stuff.
[117:57.57]That's like not a true FPS game, I don't like it.
[118:00.59]By the way, that is like an actual response I've gotten to somebody that played TF2 for about 30 minutes.
[118:06.48]Uh, thank you Eifs for the $15.
[118:11.23]Hey Jerma, hope you're feeling alright.
[118:13.07]Make sure you get everything checked out, but I never mentioned that the Thursday meetup at PAX, uh, Star was literally right behind you in the corner.
[118:22.82]Was he?
[118:23.44]I literally didn't, I didn't say hi to him because he seemed pretty tired out after the day.
[118:27.44]Wasn't sure if you noticed him or not.
[118:28.94]Oof.
[118:29.16]I don't know, I probably made like, I, you know, I think, I think I did see somebody that looked like him a little bit.
[118:37.11]But, I mean, I'm sure he was there at PAX.
[118:42.63]I'm sure he was there, yeah.
[118:44.15]Didn't know he was, like, right behind me.
[118:45.29]That's weird.
[118:48.59]Is he, like, following me around?
[118:49.81]Is he following me now?
[118:57.55]Thank you, composition, for the 69 cents.
[119:01.22]Hopefully your stomach stops hurting.
[119:03.54]Thank you for the laughs.
[119:04.40]Thanks, man.
[119:07.50]It was a spy.
[119:08.42]Oof.
[119:14.62]What a weirdo.
[119:16.79]Aw, thank you, composition.
[119:18.69]Darkstar7000, thanks for the five bucks.
[119:20.49]It's been quite a week for me, Jeremy.
[119:22.57]Nearly done with community college, getting ready to transfer to another college.
[119:26.38]And I just bought my first car, which has been hell to buy insurance for and get registered.
[119:31.87]So glad to see you.
[119:33.39]Hope you feel better soon.
[119:34.47]Thank you, Darkstar.
[119:36.61]Congratulations on your college transfer here.
[119:41.14]And a new car.
[119:42.86]It's always fun to get your first actual car.
[119:48.08]Have fun, but be safe.
[119:49.66]And be careful.
[119:50.42]Keep your eyes on the fucking road.
[119:54.00]Thank you, man.
[119:54.66]Thanks for the five bucks.
[119:55.32]Thank you, Darkstar, again!
[119:58.09]Also, holy shit, what a PogChamp mid-air headshot.
[120:04.35]Yeah, I mean, what's that saying?
[120:06.67]A broken clock is right twice a day?
[120:10.79]Nah, I'll give you some.
[120:11.41]I'm gonna give you some.
[120:11.97]Come on, that was a good shot.
[120:13.60]The one in three hours.
[120:16.36]Thanks, man.
[120:17.74]Hey, Emperor Zoran, thanks for the 25 cents.
[120:21.16]Nice to see you play TF2 again, however, shortly.
[120:23.96]It's nice to see you sit back and chill.
[120:25.64]God bless you, and thank you for making us smile.
[120:27.70]Yeah, I mean...
[120:29.62]Today was one of those days to just not really go too over the top or try to do anything like crazy or something.
[120:40.87]Like, oh, I'm going to try to do this.
[120:41.91]I'm going to do like one of these streams today where I do a bunch of shit on camera.
[120:47.53]I'd rather just relax and just play a couple of games.
[120:51.33]Obviously, because the way that I've been feeling today.
[120:55.61]But thanks, man.
[120:56.17]I appreciate it.
[120:57.65]Yeah, I mean, I feel the same way about TF2 that I do with WoW.
[120:59.53]The only difference is WoW costs money and I can't do that.
[121:21.58]TF2 is just one of those games where you just, doesn't matter what time of day it is, doesn't matter what the hell you're doing, you can just play it, and you can just play it for like an hour, and just, that's it.
[121:33.91]I do that with World of Warcraft, or at least I used to, but I just got sick of paying money for it.
[121:41.57]I just got sick of like, oh yeah, I could go check and see what's going on in WoW.
[121:46.66]I really don't want to reactivate a monthly subscription though.
[121:50.10]So, just didn't... That's the wall that's there enough for me to not care about checking it out again.
[121:57.11]But yeah.
[121:58.59]Thanks, man.
[121:58.89]Thank you, Green Spy, for the $1.
[122:00.35]You're awesome, Jeremy.
[122:01.07]Thanks for literally making everyone in this chat happy.
[122:06.26]Yeah, like I told you when we first opened it, I wasn't going for like...
[122:13.43]Here he is.
[122:14.27]He's playing TF2 again.
[122:15.72]And yep, everybody, here he is playing Team Fortress.
[122:18.90]Like, aren't you so happy?
[122:21.02]I don't want you guys to think that I'm... Oh, here it comes.
[122:26.76]I'm gonna play this and I'm... I just did it because I felt like doing it.
[122:30.63]That's pretty much how every stream is.
[122:35.15]This stream and this space here is always like just things that I just fucking feel like doing.
[122:41.74]Doesn't matter what it is.
[122:42.86]It could be a video game.
[122:43.68]It could be something fucking completely different.
[122:47.57]It doesn't matter what it is.
[122:49.11]If it's something that I want to do, I'm just going to do it.
[122:53.39]And I think over the years, that has stuck in my brain.
[123:01.52]That's just the way it is.
[123:04.35]And I could tell you, like, yeah, I'm probably never going to play TF2 ever again.
[123:07.79]I don't know.
[123:09.00]One day, I just might fucking turn it on because I don't give a shit and I want to do it.
[123:13.22]Like today.
[123:16.32]I'm very sporadic.
[123:18.74]It could be a virtual novel.
[123:26.93]But it's as fun as I remember.
[123:29.59]The core video game there has not changed, which is a good thing.
[123:33.96]I'm sure there's some things that need to be changed balance-wise, but the video game has not really changed its roots, its core.
[123:41.73]But yeah, thanks, man.
[123:42.81]Thank you, Halbritt, for the $1.
[123:44.33]Thank you, Greenspy, again, for the $5 here.
[123:48.41]You wouldn't believe how much you've lifted my spirits through the years.
[123:50.69]Much love, man.
[123:53.91]Much love right back at you, Greenspy.
[123:55.41]Thank you.
[123:59.89]Thank God you played after the Pyro update.
[124:02.21]It was awful.
[124:04.86]God, I would have been... That would have been a sour taste if the Pyro... The Pyro update was really that bad, huh?
[124:12.09]Because that was the nail in the coffin for me.
[124:13.89]Like, I remember hearing a lot of very negative things about the game.
[124:18.87]So I stayed away from it.
[124:22.55]But, uh, yeah.
[124:23.77]Thanks, dude.
[124:24.21]Thank you to Rogue Fort.
[124:29.09]Thank you to Rogue Fort for the 25 cents.
[124:30.56]I apologize for my last message.
[124:32.12]I got a tad carried away.
[124:34.32]It was nostalgia, that's all.
[124:36.08]But this does remind me of a game I find myself sinking a lot of time into.
[124:39.88]But I already said Deadbolt was my last request.
[124:42.86]Would you mind if I hand off a few more personal favorites of mine?
[124:46.88]Yeah, man, you don't have to... Nobody has a good limit to the amount of games they can request on the stream.
[124:51.76]That's not... No, you met your limit.
[124:54.86]You can only request two games.
[124:57.50]No, say whatever you want.
[125:00.10]Request whatever you want.
[125:02.65]Usually I'll take a look at it and determine if it's something that I want to do.
[125:05.51]I don't feel like you're... You can't make a suggestion ever again because you made one already.
[125:10.49]That's... No, that's... Go for it, man.
[125:16.57]Thanks a lot.
[125:16.99]Thank you, Manboy777 for the 25 cents.
[125:19.51]So this is... Is this a live, live gameplay commentary?
[125:24.61]No, because I wasn't really talking that much.
[125:27.54]I was kind of just going like this.
[125:30.42]Where'd he go?
[125:34.47]Oh, is he there?
[125:39.18]Shit.
[125:40.90]What is that move?
[125:41.82]Oh.
[125:41.92]Because today was just, like I said, just a chill.
[125:48.04]Not much in my brain going on, so.
[125:56.93]Thank you.
[125:57.31]Cheese it up for the $5.
[125:58.23]Did you say 2012, Jerma?
[126:01.80]He's funny again.
[126:04.10]Rejoice.
[126:07.03]2012 Jerma was not funny.
[126:10.41]2012 Jerma was a used car salesman.
[126:16.17]2012 Jerma was not funny.
[126:18.49]He was very serious.
[126:20.03]He was a very serious guy.
[126:26.85]You're thinking of like 2014, 2013 Jerma.
[126:38.38]Don't be so hard on 2012 Jerma.
[126:44.20]I like 2016 and beyond Jerma.
[126:48.74]Because it's me.
[126:51.80]You know?
[126:57.31]Jermacraft Jerma was best Jerma.
[126:58.95]Yeah, 2012 Jerma was Jermacraft.
[127:07.27]2011, 2012, that was like, and here I am playing Minecraft.
[127:10.31]That guy's funny?
[127:17.88]I told you, there's like a hundred of us.
[127:22.08]I keep trying to get, they keep trying to put me back in the well and I keep stopping it.
[127:26.67]I've gone to that well blindfolded three times now.
[127:31.65]And they can't get me in.
[127:34.31]Because I grab the guy who's supposed to be the new one, and I fucking throw him in the well.
[127:41.61]Nobody thought to do this.
[127:43.83]I don't know why, I look down there and I see the well full of all these fucking people that look like me.
[127:48.58]And I'm like, what the fuck are they doing down there?
[127:50.10]And all of a sudden, one of the other Jermas comes over.
[127:53.50]Looks really young and handsome.
[127:55.86]He has this, like, staff in his hand.
[127:57.94]And he's like, and you are now banished.
[128:00.11]I'm just like, I'm not going anywhere.
[128:01.07]And I grabbed him and I fucking threw him in the staff down the well.
[128:05.73]Like, how have, like, 41 of them not done this yet?
[128:11.47]I ain't going in that well.
[128:12.52]It's not gonna happen.
[128:20.14]Dressed in, like, a weird... The guy was dressed in, like... It was me, but he was dressed in a strange, like, white robe.
[128:27.88]And he had, like, a priest thing on his neck.
[128:30.35]He had, like, a cross on his neck.
[128:36.12]He was chanting these, like, incantations.
[128:38.13]He had a big staff with a big cross on it.
[128:43.51]He was like a Christian guy.
[128:45.91]I don't know.
[128:50.82]You guys, seriously, the last one, you really think that you Christian priest Jerma, is that what you wanted?
[128:57.06]You still got me for the last couple of years.
[129:00.85]These streams would be mass if it wasn't for me.
[129:14.34]Hey, thanks.
[129:16.28]Thank you, Penny Kettle.
[129:20.00]No, hold on, we gotta go back down.
[129:23.38]Uh, thank you, The Wombat from Hell for the $1.
[129:25.74]Unironically, do you actually like Garfield?
[129:28.91]No.
[129:29.01]No, I don't.
[129:32.81]I do not like Garfield.
[129:35.13]Maybe, like, 10 to 15 years ago, I thought he was passable.
[129:39.59]I don't like Garfield.
[129:52.53]imagine you know that's I'm thinking about this now irl no one's done like a mass can you do that is that is it allowed could I like do a mass on stream as a priest what would happen is that considered like tos I could do that right
[130:18.25]do it like is that who would watch a mass just like an hour and a half like a full mass you did that in kingdom come that's true yeah but what if it wasn't but like any real religion what if this was my religion
[130:50.12]Like it's our own religion?
[130:51.14]Can I stream like a pretend cult?
[130:53.10]Like I'm addressing my followers?
[130:56.95]And I would write out a full speech of nonsense?
[131:00.71]That would be kind of insane.
[131:08.96]I wonder what would happen.
[131:09.90]I wonder if they would take it seriously.
[131:14.53]Like, the wine comes out, and I'm like, yeah, like, give me that wine.
[131:16.81]And I just slam it.
[131:19.47]And it's just like, no, no, no, this is not, this is not, like, any, anything religious.
[131:23.59]I just, like, fucking want it.
[131:24.73]I just keep bringing it out.
[131:30.59]I, like, pass it around.
[131:32.45]I feel like that would probably, that would probably piss people off.
[131:35.19]That might actually piss people off.
[131:41.22]Alcohol is illegal.
[131:48.30]St.
[131:48.76]Orson Welles.
[131:53.80]Get like a rock band to play behind me just the whole time while I'm doing my sermon.
[131:59.11]And they're very loud.
[132:04.19]I might think about this.
[132:04.95]This sounds fun.
[132:06.67]But thanks, man.
[132:08.72]Thank you too.
[132:10.24]Did we get there by somebody saying do I unironically like Garfield?
[132:12.96]I don't know how we got there.
[132:17.75]But thanks.
[132:18.07]Thanks, Penny Kettle, for the 28 cents.
[132:19.64]Hey, this is gonna be hard to say.
[132:21.50]Probably about as hard as it's going to be to hear.
[132:23.98]My name is Aaron Elbertson, your biological daughter.
[132:29.94]I found this stream by a stroke of luck.
[132:32.42]After seeing you eat Easter dinner with the family, I did some research and made the connection.
[132:36.83]It would mean a lot to me to meet you.
[132:39.27]I just want a relationship with my father.
[132:40.93]Do you?
[132:49.30]Nah.
[132:50.96]Thank you, ActualDragonTears, for the one time.
[132:59.81]Bring me Meadowman to fight.
[133:02.47]Hey, Jerma, I made it to the stream after all.
[133:04.25]Glad to see you going back to your roots a little bit.
[133:06.09]Ow, my knuckles.
[133:12.55]It's not real.
[133:14.85]No, it's not real.
[133:15.49]Everyone's calling me a bad father.
[133:17.67]Alright, but, alright, you want to go on Mari?
[133:21.23]Let's go on Mari.
[133:23.21]They can prick my finger and put the blood on the paper and find out if I, in fact, am the father.
[133:33.35]And then when it's like, and after the DNA test, it turns out that you are the father, and it's like, no, fuck, and the guy gets up, like, screams, like, no, and the crowd goes crazy.
[133:49.67]That's the next stream.
[133:54.54]Guy gets up, like, throws chairs around, like, this is bullshit!
[134:02.90]Do a lie detector test on, uh, on Mari, too.
[134:07.04]And determine that that was also a lie.
[134:10.12]No, man, fuck you, Mari!
[134:12.08]Fuck you!
[134:13.46]When you said that you were never gonna play Team Fortress 2 ever again.
[134:18.29]The lie detector test determined that that was a lie.
[134:20.89]No, fuck this show.
[134:22.23]And I would just get up and like leave.
[134:31.61]Lie detectors are bullshit.
[134:38.93]I want to... How much does that cost?
[134:43.41]How much does it cost?
[134:45.87]How much is a polygraph?
[134:48.39]How much is it to fucking hire somebody that can do a polygraph and have the machine in this room?
[134:54.18]And you guys can get a bunch of questions for me and I will do a polygraph on stream.
[134:59.46]That's the... Write it down.
[135:01.20]That's happening.
[135:02.06]I swear to God.
[135:04.98]We are doing a polygraph bit stream.
[135:07.85]We're doing like a joke.
[135:09.27]We're doing a polygraph stream.
[135:13.81]Where do I get one?
[135:17.00]and you guys can have like a series of like 25 questions and I will sit there and do it on stream with a professional to monitor it oh that's gonna be fun polygraphed I'll figure it out that's going in the book man that's going that's happening much sooner than I think you would I understand
[135:47.42]That's a bad idea.
[135:48.34]No, the questions would get vetted, obviously.
[135:50.98]It's not gonna be like, oh, do you like poo-poo and pee-pee?
[135:53.25]Haha.
[135:55.21]No, we're gonna take the top, like, 10, top 20 questions.
[136:00.27]Real questions.
[136:01.15]And I'm gonna be hooked up to the machine and shit.
[136:09.30]Oh, I can't wait for this.
[136:11.40]I gotta get in touch with the right people now.
[136:15.68]Yeah, it's just gonna be called The Polygraph.
[136:18.40]I'm gonna make... We're gonna get in a dark room with a big floodlight pointing straight down on me.
[136:24.15]Machine right here.
[136:25.85]Eerie fucking music in the background.
[136:28.45]You heard it here first.
[136:29.17]It's happening.
[136:29.80]I swear to God, I promise.
[136:40.90]With my shirt off.
[136:42.36]With my shirt off with, like, cuts all over me.
[136:44.49]Like, I've been down there for a while.
[136:49.53]They're, like, trying to get information.
[136:50.93]No, now I'm, like, turning this into something else.
[136:53.89]You'll see.
[137:02.92]So, run that around your mind for a little bit.
[137:07.11]Because I'm going to try to make this happen within the next couple weeks.
[137:12.45]I'm going to try as hard as I can to make that a reality.
[137:15.91]As soon as fucking possible.
[137:19.29]Just give me a little bit.
[137:22.98]So, stop thinking about what kind of questions you'd want to ask.
[137:31.50]Hey, Bubble Ass Pickles, thank you for the... No, it's Bubble Bass Pickles.
[137:38.13]Thanks for the 10 bucks earlier.
[137:40.03]Where are your unusuals?
[137:40.97]I gave my backpack away like three times.
[137:45.51]So, I don't have any.
[137:48.09]I'm so excited for that now.
[137:49.57]That's got me all kinds of giddy.
[137:51.91]Really.
[137:55.39]Twitch TOSA, it's not going to be a problem.
[137:57.66]I'm just doing a polygraph on camera.
[138:01.84]What, are they going to be mad about that?
[138:03.22]Don't do that.
[138:05.08]Don't have your true nature be shown.
[138:11.57]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[138:14.33]Oh my gosh, TF2, we love you.
[138:16.07]I'm getting a nostalgia rush seeing you return to your old stomping grounds in TF2.
[138:19.05]Those nine mercs are some of my favorite characters ever.
[138:23.32]Brings a tear to my humongous eye.
[138:26.32]This is the best Garf Day present a cat could ask for.
[138:29.57]No joke, it's actually one of my acting coach's birthdays today.
[138:33.31]Lorenzo Music.
[138:34.35]What a talent.
[138:35.01]Not only did he provide the voice for me, but the super pack from the Pac-Man cartoons.
[138:39.39]He's to me what Paul Bearer is to you.
[138:41.12]Thanks for everything.
[138:45.78]I can't.
[138:46.84]I can't.
[138:48.06]There's been a thousand of these.
[138:54.67]Thank you, Fodders, for the 50 cents.
[138:57.81]Hey, Owen.
[138:59.99]No, it's OnlyAlex.
[139:02.73]Thanks for the 50 cents.
[139:05.69]Jeremy, you absolutely made my day.
[139:06.89]I had three finals today and five AP tests over the next couple of weeks.
[139:11.44]So the place to decompress is very appreciated.
[139:14.94]Thank you for the 50 cents, man.
[139:16.58]Good luck on all of your tests.
[139:20.26]Thank you.
[139:22.43]Jurg, thanks for the 100 bits.

[139:31.07]Thank you for the $10, Vile.
[139:32.35]Or Villa.
[139:35.85]And then Benny Jets right after that.
[139:37.09]$15 from Benny Jets.
[139:39.35]Hey, Jerma, I was just in your TF2 match.
[139:40.93]You might have saw me.
[139:41.71]My name was Minimal.
[139:43.63]I tried healing you, but you kept running into their whole team and killing yourself.
[139:47.37]Good game, though.
[139:47.97]You're the best.
[139:48.84]Thanks, dude.
[139:49.30]Appreciate the 15 fucking dollars.
[139:52.11]Truth be told, I probably have about three or four thousand hours in TF2.
[139:53.89]I've been playing that game off and on for thousands of hours since the game was in beta.
[139:56.17]Back when the game was not even released when it was in beta,
[140:19.36]I was playing.
[140:20.64]Like five days before the game came out in 2007.
[140:25.26]Thousands of hours.
[140:27.92]I have like 2,000... 2,400 hours clocked on Steam.
[140:32.53]And I was playing TF2 every day, all day, before Steam was even clocking hours.
[140:42.14]It's a very old game.
[140:44.23]How did you get the beta?
[140:45.21]You were allowed to play the game, like, five days early or something if you pre-ordered the orange box.
[140:51.88]You could play in, like, the little stress beta they had, like, a week before the game came out.
[141:05.83]Pre-ordering existed?
[141:07.17]Yeah, it was the orange box.
[141:13.44]But thanks, man.
[141:14.04]Thank you, Snooze, for the 97 cents.
[141:15.77]Tell Snooze and Copter that they're stealing my identity.
[141:18.99]Not the other way around.
[141:20.99]Also, hi, Jermal.
[141:22.43]Love you.
[141:26.39]Well, that's a battle between you.
[141:27.59]I got nothing to do with that.
[141:28.55]Snooze and Copter, right now, right after that, said, New bits, new you.
[141:33.15]Okay, wait.
[141:33.67]No, hold on.
[141:35.18]At Snooze, you listen.
[141:36.24]If you want to argue with me in bit messages, here I am.
[141:38.56]Identity thief.
[141:40.52]Oh, my God.

[142:09.51]It explains why you have planet emotes.
[142:11.07]Get fucking caught, alien scum.
[142:14.94]Why are you guys so against aliens?
[142:16.74]You know we got the internet from aliens, right?
[142:19.98]You know, we traded, like, military secrets to get the internet.
[142:24.86]And flat screens.
[142:26.62]Aliens gave us flat screen TVs.
[142:29.90]Look it up.

[142:59.28]Thank you.
[143:01.72]Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[143:02.86]You should add the save and bash commands.
[143:04.79]If we manage to save enough seagulls, play Doki Doki.
[143:10.36]No.
[143:11.40]No.
[143:13.08]Thank you, Abdomality, for the one dollar.
[143:14.94]It's true, I was at... Hubble the other day and that peeped Pluto.

[143:24.52]Grizzly1620, thanks for the 25 cents.
[143:27.16]I have a story for you and it's not a joke, I'm dead serious.
[143:30.63]I was once in a search party looking for me while at summer camp.
[143:36.61]Wait, what?
[143:38.89]Wait, hold on a second.
[143:40.60]I was once in a search party looking for me while at summer camp.
[143:47.04]So you were, hold on, you were blending in with the crowd looking for you.
[143:54.21]Did you have a mask on?
[143:57.17]I'm confused.
[144:01.66]Where is he?
[144:02.36]Oh my God, we gotta find him.
[144:03.64]Yeah, let's go find him.
[144:06.48]Yeah, let's go find that guy that I am.
[144:10.17]Search every room, search every nook and cranny.
[144:17.67]Did you ever find yourself?
[144:19.71]Apparently they did.
[144:20.51]Well, I'm glad that you guys found you.
[144:30.24]Thanks, Grizzly.
[144:30.90]Thank you, D Flyers, for the 70 cents.
[144:33.78]I'm so glad you played TF2.
[144:34.96]I was going to unsub because of that bamboozle.
[144:39.44]No, I don't do that.
[144:40.70]I don't actually bamboozle.
[144:42.18]I don't actually... No.
[144:45.63]I say what I mean and I do what I say.
[144:47.07]And I say what I mean... Every day.
[144:51.19]Villa, thanks for the $1.
[144:52.37]Missed to type my message in first.
[144:55.65]So I had to get more bits, but thank you for all the laughs.
[144:59.09]It's all good, man.
[144:59.69]Thank you for the $1.
[145:00.31]Appreciate it, man.
[145:02.29]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[145:03.11]Did you say Z?
[145:06.14]Thank you.
[145:07.56]Dr. Clay, again, for $1.
[145:10.18]Sorry, I hit enter too soon for that.
[145:12.30]But thanks for the stream.
[145:13.44]It was fun to see you play TF2.
[145:14.48]TF2 is fun to play still for me, but I do not play it as often as I used to.
[145:19.35]Hope you feel better.
[145:21.95]Thank you, man.
[145:24.89]And, uh... Careful with those typos.
[145:30.17]You don't want to accidentally give more money than you should.
[145:33.15]Thanks, dude.
[145:34.85]Not that many left here.
[145:35.91]We got Bobboy for the $1.
[145:38.15]Hey, I had fun playing with you today.
[145:39.29]I am Bobboy.
[145:41.50]It'd be nice if you played Half-Life 2 because I asked a couple months ago and you said that you both had it and hadn't finished it.
[145:47.90]Which I feel bad about because it's so good.
[145:49.82]Personal request?
[145:51.14]Play Ravenholm in the dark with facecam.
[145:56.02]I'll give it a look.
[145:57.56]But Half-Life 2, I probably will not ever play that on stream.
[146:02.75]I think my favorite moment of the stream is this because of the soda cans in the background.
[146:05.99]That's from Dr. Clay.
[146:06.89]Thanks for the $1.
[146:07.29]And here it is.
[146:08.75]What is it?
[146:11.78]Oh, there's a fucking trick in the book!
[146:19.35]You guys wouldn't believe how much random shit I just pile around me.
[146:25.79]Let me know if you guys do this shit.
[146:28.30]Maybe this is me just being a slob.
[146:30.18]But I'm a fairly clean person.
[146:33.16]I shower every day.
[146:34.06]I take care of myself.
[146:35.82]I eat very healthy.
[146:37.14]I don't like... I have a face wash routine.
[146:41.06]I wash my... I'm a clean person.
[146:43.62]Very clean.
[146:46.03]But... I don't... For some reason...
[146:49.95]My area, my desk, a spot that I spend more than like three or four hours a day at, it gets so cluttered with shit.
[147:00.49]I don't throw anything in a trash can.
[147:02.29]I have cans of sodas and ciders and water glasses and bottles, and it makes a gigantic like stockpile on my desk.
[147:12.53]So what I do is I decide, huh, this is getting a little out of control up here on my desk.
[147:18.82]I have an idea.
[147:20.18]I'm going to pick up the cans and the bottles from the desk, and instead of taking it to a trash can, I'm going to place them as a moat around my chair.
[147:32.75]There are one, two, three, four, five, six... There are four Dunkin' Donuts large iced coffee containers.
[147:42.22]There is a full...
[147:45.73]There is a two-quart Simply Orange orange juice container here.
[147:51.35]There are three cans, two glasses, and my desk also has two bottles and three cans on it.
[148:05.78]No, not full.
[148:06.51]It's full orange juice.
[148:12.53]It's not a full orange juice.
[148:14.79]But you guys think I'm talking about like a full two gallon orange juice?
[148:20.58]They're all empty.
[148:22.62]And that's it, this six.
[148:27.55]And then I cleaned the whole thing and it's beautiful in here.
[148:33.69]There's nothing in here.
[148:37.51]Messy but hygienic.
[148:39.78]All these are empty.
[148:41.89]There's nothing in them.
[148:46.63]Some of them are just... There's literally... See?
[148:50.91]Nothing in here.
[148:55.17]I don't leave food out.
[148:56.27]Because that's bad.
[148:57.35]You get fucking ants and shit.
[148:58.83]I don't fuck around with that.
[148:59.75]Throw it away while you're thinking about it.
[149:03.01]I'm thinking about it right now.
[149:05.25]And I'm not throwing them away.
[149:17.39]Just because there is an empty and a completely empty capped orange juice container.
[149:25.40]What's going to happen here?
[149:26.24]Nothing.
[149:27.16]It's just plastic that's sitting there.
[149:31.75]There was bread during the Santa stream.
[149:33.37]That's still there.
[149:34.23]It's right there.
[149:35.99]That's just bread.
[149:36.59]It's fine.
[149:53.31]It's not still... Please.
[149:54.78]Guys, I clean my... I clean down here.
[149:58.50]I clean my house, like, once every, like, two weeks.
[150:03.56]I just steam... Excuse me.
[150:05.56]Calm down, everybody.
[150:06.66]I just steamed all of my floors with a shark steam mop.
[150:10.48]Last night.
[150:14.09]Shark steam mop.
[150:18.35]It was... Oh, it's beautiful.
[150:20.17]Completely squeaky clean floors.
[150:26.83]Where were we?
[150:27.35]What were we doing?
[150:31.99]Oh, okay.
[150:32.25]We're right here.
[150:32.77]Thank you, Prime Vin, for the $1.
[150:35.45]Shadowman for the PS1 would be a fun game to play on stream, unless you've already played it.
[150:40.05]We played a lot of random PlayStation 1 games.
[150:41.83]I don't even remember if that was one of them.
[150:44.43]But I'll give it a look.
[150:48.11]Cheese it.
[150:48.52]Thanks for the $5.
[150:49.56]Cheese it up.
[150:50.90]I'm proud to say Priest Jerma was birthed from a stupid donation joke I made.
[150:54.24]Thank you, Jerma.
[150:54.90]Thumbs up.
[150:56.74]Thank you, Cheez-It.
[150:58.26]Thank you for the $5.
[151:00.10]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[151:02.14]In the beginning, there was a Jerma, and it was good.
[151:04.86]On the first day, Jerma created the Shpee, and it was good.
[151:07.14]On the second day, Jerma created the Bia, and it was good.
[151:10.04]On the third day, Jerma created the Shoutcast, and it was good.
[151:13.32]On the fourth and fifth days, he created more memes that I can't remember.
[151:16.86]Then he rested over the weekend because he fucked up his sleep schedule.
[151:22.84]Yes, thank you, man.
[151:24.54]Thank you bro luck for the one dollar.
[151:25.84]They don't let people use polygraphs for no good reason.
[151:28.70]They don't want people to train themselves on it.
[151:31.08]If you're going to do this, it's probably going to be very expensive.
[151:33.90]I don't give a shit.
[151:38.85]I like don't care.
[151:41.51]It's worth it.
[151:47.59]I don't care if this costs like two or three thousand dollars.
[151:49.58]I'm doing it.
[151:50.78]I don't give a shit.
[151:57.80]It might even be more than that.
[151:59.02]But, like, you know what?
[152:00.18]Fuck it.
[152:03.16]You only get that kind of opportunity once.

[152:22.15]Haha.

[155:04.90]Those are also two of my favorite characters from those games.
[155:07.90]I'll take Gascoigne.
[155:08.92]Gascoigne's probably the better one to pick.
[155:13.46]He was cool.

[155:22.28]VRJosh, thanks for the five dollars.

[155:26.05]Honestly, cleaning up a messy room is really good for mental health.
[155:29.25]I recently threw out a bunch of empty bottles I'd collected and it really makes my apartment feel more livable.
[155:34.11]Really helped my mental well-being.
[155:36.24]Yeah, cleaning is great.
[155:38.92]It almost like refreshes the space for you.
[155:41.50]I mean, this room is not dirty.
[155:42.92]This room is not dirty.
[155:46.24]There's just like six cans on the table and like four Dunkin' Donuts containers on the ground.
[155:51.66]The room is clean.
[155:52.58]I've cleaned it.
[155:54.44]It's a dirty room.
[155:58.56]How do you get rid of a giant TV?
[156:06.78]What am I going to do with this?
[156:08.00]It's still here.
[156:09.30]That huge CRT TV that's like 400 pounds is still in this room and I don't know what to do with it.
[156:19.88]I can't even move it.
[156:21.61]It's too heavy.

[165:31.61]Schedule a... Schedule a pickup.
[165:34.71]Who cares?
[165:37.15]Get a quick quote.
[165:42.01]Here we go.
[165:42.59]We have the official app, the actual official how much it would cost for me to ship this TV to California.
[165:50.89]Alright.
[165:52.27]So, ladies and gentlemen, can somebody look up how much a Melee tournament championship is?
[166:00.84]If you were to be in a Melee championship, like, oh, yeah, thanks for the TV, man.
[166:06.37]We're doing our tournament here.
[166:07.85]How much money do they get for first place?
[166:18.50]four bucks that's not 400 bucks 850 dollars it's maybe like five thousand dollars for first first place depends on the tournament like one thousand some are like 5k some of like most some of 1k let's just go with the median that it's about like three or four thousand dollars okay if it's not like a major tournament
[166:44.74]So let's say it's like three or four grand.
[166:48.02]So this TV would cost pretty much more than first place tournament champion.
[166:56.91]If they needed this TV, it's $3,800 for me to ship this TV.
[167:11.59]It has to go freight.
[167:13.09]It has to cause anything more than a hundred pounds has to go on a freight.
[167:17.75]So if that, and that's, if I did it like, Oh shit, they need this tomorrow.
[167:21.25]Right?
[167:22.49]The general just ship it.
[167:25.11]It's a just three day freight is the cheapest you can get is 2,100 bucks.
[167:32.72]Just fly there and win the championship.
[167:40.81]Good thing it's under 100 pounds.
[167:43.24]I'm weighing this fucking TV.
[167:45.22]I'm gonna weigh this TV on stream.
[167:47.84]Just you wait.
[167:49.28]Everybody will finally, we can have a sigh of relief when I get a fucking scale down here and I put the TV, I put it on there with three people and then I point the camera at the scale and you see that this TV is like 216 pounds.
[168:07.21]Yeah, I'm gonna point it at the scale.
[168:08.97]I can't do it right now because it's impossible to move with one person.
[168:12.17]It is physically impossible for me to pick this up.
[168:20.99]I'm gonna bring in a deli scale.
[168:23.25]No, yeah, I'm gonna bring in a fucking fruit scale.
[168:27.05]You wanna bet on that 216 pounds?
[168:28.01]Okay.
[168:28.15]I...
[168:34.01]How do we know you won't tamper with the scale?
[168:35.57]It'll be in the plastic wrap.
[168:37.39]Fine.
[168:37.75]You guys want to play that game?
[168:38.89]I will go buy a new scale.
[168:41.15]I don't own one.
[168:42.15]So I have to buy.
[168:42.94]I don't own a scale.
[168:44.54]So I'm going to go to fucking Walmart.
[168:46.34]I'm going to get a scale.
[168:48.52]I'm going to keep it in the shrink wrap.
[168:51.50]And I will unbox the scale on stream, place it down, and place TV on in the same frame.
[169:02.23]We'll see.
[169:03.07]We'll see if this TV is more or less than 200 pounds.
[169:07.89]If this TV is less than 100 pounds, I'll eat a jalapeno pepper on stream.
[169:19.82]How do we know the scale is correct out of the box?
[169:23.18]What are you talking about?
[169:24.06]How would you... What, the scale doesn't work?
[169:37.34]And that's just to send it to California.
[169:39.50]Imagine if I sent this to, like, Australia.
[169:41.58]It would be, like, $30,000.
[169:42.44]The TV might just crush the scale and break, and then all of a sudden it's like, there you go, guys.
[169:51.70]Alright, where are we on bits?
[170:02.07]Uh, where are we?
[170:02.59]Alright, we got, like, one more.
[170:05.51]Two more.
[170:10.04]Uh, Ongar, thanks for the $1, why no more Ster collabs?
[170:14.08]I'm just doing different things.
[170:16.05]Different people, different scenarios.
[170:18.07]Don't worry, everything's good.
[170:20.79]Hey, Tiggy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[170:22.07]I'm almost out of bits, so I'll now be cheering in 25 cent increments.
[170:25.11]BibleThump.
[170:26.03]It's alright, man.
[170:27.96]And last but not least, Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[170:29.88]Why don't you just buy a rubbish bin and put it in the room with you?
[170:33.02]At least it would stop the clutter.
[170:34.90]But that doesn't stop the trash.
[170:36.66]It just goes into a... It just... Look.
[170:39.29]A trash bag or a trash bin.
[170:40.97]Yeah, it would go right here and it would go... All of it would collect inside of that trash bag.
[170:46.13]But guess what?
[170:47.03]When that trash bin fills up... That's just a gigantic spot for me to put everything and I'm not going to take it out.
[171:00.74]Rubbish bins.
[171:04.28]Wait a minute.
[171:04.74]I need to show this.
[171:06.20]Because... This is another thing, man.
[171:11.22]Every trash barrel or little trash bin that I've ever purchased for, like, an office, or I've ever had for an office, are... they're tiny.
[171:20.65]And they can only hold... they can hold, like, a handful of Kleenexes and, like, maybe a crumpled up piece of newspaper.
[171:29.90]Why, they're tiny!
[171:31.16]And I don't want to get, like, a giant trash barrel here.
[171:40.85]That's my excuse.
[171:42.45]Buy a bigger one.
[171:43.07]I don't want a bigger one.
[171:44.57]What about the Feng Shui?
[171:49.83]That's not going to go with Feng Shui with the giant TV back here.
[171:54.66]Alright.
[171:56.00]I'm going to get out of here, guys.
[171:57.28]Thanks for sticking around.
[172:00.52]As always, have a fantastic rest of your night.
[172:03.02]I will see you guys on Saturday and Sunday.
[172:04.50]Those streams should be fun.
[172:09.25]Take care, everybody.
[172:10.83]See you Saturday.
[172:13.09]Good night.
[172:14.33]And good luck to you.
[172:22.33]I skipped your bits.
[172:23.03]What are you talking about?
[172:25.38]Oh, well, you just gave it right now.
[172:26.38]Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.
[172:27.68]Here's another dollar for the good times.
[172:28.92]Never stop being you.
[172:29.70]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[172:31.48]Don't you ever stop being you either.
[172:34.10]Much love to you.
[172:36.52]Good night, guys.
