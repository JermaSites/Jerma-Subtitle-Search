[05:34.50]Take out the camera.
[05:36.90]How do I do a selfie?
[05:40.28]I know you can.
[05:41.72]I've seen it.
[05:49.07]Can I flip the camera around?
[05:52.35]Alright, here we go.
[05:53.57]Selfie.
[05:58.91]Start photo mode.
[06:00.29]Switch mode?
[06:01.09]Okay.
[06:05.06]Okay.
[06:10.93]It's got to be Noir.
[06:15.55]Okay, so that's good.
[06:21.24]Every single person has done this.
[06:24.32]Everyone.
[06:40.01]Okay, cool.
[06:49.59]So how do I take the photo?
[06:51.15]How do I take the photo?
[06:52.75]Photo mode, hide UI, and then how do I take the picture?
[06:57.27]Does it just hold it?
[07:08.10]Use the screenshot button?
[07:13.14]Wait, what do you mean the actual screenshot button?
[07:28.76]I got it.
[07:32.19]Okay, cool.
[07:33.95]Hello?
[07:34.41]Hi, Mr. Lee.
[07:36.45]Hey, Peter.
[07:37.05]We're all set for the party whenever you're ready.
[07:39.41]Cool.
[07:39.81]I'm on my way.
[07:41.97]Maximum speed!
[07:50.10]Yes!
[07:57.68]Okay, time to go to the party.
[08:01.65]Can you hit the ground?
[08:02.55]Uh, you cannot.
[08:04.09]You just kind of land.
[08:11.77]That hurt.
[08:14.69]Get the Twix.
[08:16.35]There is no Twix here.
[08:18.19]Why did I just turn into a cat for a second?
[08:25.60]Okay, let's go to the party.
[08:31.51]Wish you could stumble.
[08:33.75]Yeah, I mean, if there really was...
[08:37.12]body kind of damage or physics based if you run into buildings you'll just get squashed just smash and like wasted GTA shows up man that would be so much fun you could just fly right into a building you wake up in the hospital yeah
[09:10.97]Almost there.
[09:12.68]Backpack.
[09:13.10]I can't worry about the backpacks yet.
[09:14.36]Not right now.
[09:20.26]Right here.
[09:23.40]Knock that guy over.
[09:24.08]Changing clothes?
[09:40.65]The costume changes probably make people think that there are multiple Spider-Mans.
[09:45.73]Yeah.
[09:48.47]I mean, technically, wouldn't Venom be another Spider-Man?
[09:52.68]Mr. Lee's probably in the kitchen getting ready for the party.
[09:54.92]He does the same shit.
[09:55.78]I mean, what do you mean, no?
[09:59.42]If you see Venom floating around the city, that's another Spider-Man.
[10:04.86]How do you know who has the mask on?
[10:05.96]I gave you my paperwork yesterday.
[10:07.71]I've been clean for like two months.
[10:14.65]He's a blob of a symbiote.
[10:16.35]Nobody knows how I became Spider-Man.
[10:17.87]For all they know, I could be an alien.
[10:19.79]Thanks.
[10:23.19]Nobody knows how I got the Spider-Man powers.
[10:27.18]What's this?
[10:27.58]Are we playing chess?
[10:29.14]Hey, guys.
[10:29.82]How's the game going?
[10:31.00]How's it look like it's going?
[10:32.68]I'm winning.
[10:33.72]Get this guy checked for dementia, Pete.
[10:36.00]I'm crushing him.
[10:37.46]Well, the important thing is having fun.
[10:40.26]See, he gets it.
[10:41.22]Excuse me.
[10:41.82]Going this way.
[10:43.35]I mean, there's stuff to experience here.
[10:45.85]Right?
[10:46.65]I can't just run around the whole thing and just skip the whole thing, can I?
[10:49.93]I guess I can.
[11:04.91]Hey, Peter.
[11:06.81]What's up?
[11:07.25]Hold on.
[11:07.87]Just dropping in.
[11:09.55]Who is this?
[11:11.59]I don't know.
[11:11.91]I don't know who that is.
[11:13.85]Alright, there's... Is that Harry?
[11:19.30]Hey, Martin.
[11:20.08]So sorry I'm late.
[11:21.20]No.
[11:21.30]You were right on time.
[11:23.36]Just keep her distracted while we get everything ready.
[11:25.46]Hey, Peter.
[11:26.18]You got it.
[11:29.76]Hey, there's my favorite aunt.
[11:31.77]Peter, what a nice surprise.
[11:33.83]She just, like, slaps him.
[11:35.21]Uh, yeah, sure.
[11:36.07]Oh, there are some heavy dogs.
[11:37.91]How dare you call me that?
[11:38.55]Oh, no, I mean, I mean, I mean, not yet.
[11:41.28]I mean, I came to, uh, uh, I just, just wanted to talk.
[11:47.24]Okay.
[11:49.30]Okay.
[11:49.94]Come on.
[11:52.00]Um... Peter...
[11:55.36]Are you in trouble?
[11:57.22]Do you need money?
[11:57.76]No, no, I mean, I'm a little behind on my rent, but no, no, no, no, no, I'm fine.
[12:01.82]Girl problems again, huh?
[12:03.22]What?
[12:03.72]No, that's crazy.
[12:04.85]I still wish you and MJ could work those out.
[12:06.85]That was a little too, like, manic for me.
[12:09.43]What?
[12:10.25]Wow.
[12:13.77]Peter.
[12:16.61]What is it?
[12:19.53]Come on.
[12:20.31]You can tell me.
[12:24.79]These past few years, you helping me through college and working here, sacrificing so much and asking for nothing.
[12:34.99]I just wish there were more people like you in the world.
[12:37.47]He's right.
[12:39.79]Five years ago, you walked in here and told me you were inspired by my mission.
[12:43.68]Happy birthday.
[12:45.86]Now it's you who inspires me.
[12:49.44]Thank you, May, for everything.
[12:51.04]Oh, May.
[12:52.30]Here's to many more years of service.
[13:01.53]How old is she?
[13:03.23]55?
[13:03.93]What was the five?
[13:05.15]It was like five, they spelled out the first five years.
[13:07.79]There's five and then the number five.
[13:09.98]I just wish I could do more.
[13:11.60]Well, Mae's always told me if you help someone.
[13:14.06]You help everyone.
[13:16.82]Maybe we should send Mae to City Hall to have a word with Mare.
[13:19.32]Spider sense.
[13:20.95]No, that's my phone.
[13:21.75]I gotta run.
[13:22.21]Thanks again for the party and everything.
[13:24.47]It really means a lot.
[13:32.87]Voicemail from Yuri.
[13:34.31]Should check it outside.
[13:37.57]Bye, guys.
[13:43.27]She's five years old.
[13:49.71]Is this the new Batman game?
[13:51.79]It's a different man game.
[13:54.09]Different animal.
[13:57.44]They'll be the both still mammals.
[13:59.82]So, I mean, you're close.
[14:13.19]Man's fault.
[14:13.59]Alright, don't make a scene.
[14:15.71]I'll try not to make a scene.
[14:16.83]I like that super jump.
[14:18.11]Where did I end up?
[14:40.76]I'm like Nightcrawler.
[14:42.70]I don't know where I will end up.
[14:47.70]If I can't see where I'm going, I will end up in a vault somewhere.
[14:52.08]Most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes.
[14:58.37]Awful movie.
[15:00.31]Yeah, I had to get to the lab.
[15:02.83]Sorry.
[15:04.19]Don't apologize.
[15:06.51]I just wanted to tell you how much what you said meant to me.
[15:10.72]I always wonder if I'm doing right by you.
[15:13.12]Well, stop wondering.
[15:14.85]After losing my parents... Didn't that guy... What was his name?
[15:17.39]The guy that played Nightcrawler?
[15:18.59]Didn't he refuse to do the character ever again?
[15:20.55]Well, that works both ways.
[15:21.85]Because the makeup drove him crazy?
[15:23.93]I just wanted to make sure you knew that.
[15:26.21]May, I... I don't know what to say.
[15:29.27]Oh, I think you really need my help.
[15:32.24]I should go.
[15:33.48]See you soon, dear.
[15:35.28]I love you.
[15:35.60]I got nothing to grab.
[15:36.42]Love you, too.
[15:36.98]I can grab a tree?
[15:40.98]You don't remember that scene?
[15:45.21]Just watch it.
[15:45.83]Watch that movie.
[15:46.43]No, fuck it.
[15:50.95]Let's watch it right now.
[16:07.51]Okay, just everyone get ready.
[16:14.65]Okay.
[16:16.93]Let's get it on the screen here.
[16:22.83]You have to understand, we thought Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.
[16:26.61]Bobby is gifted.
[16:27.99]You should see what he can do.
[16:33.79]Have you tried not being a mutant?
[16:39.02]Since the discovery of their existence, mutants have been regarded with fear.
[16:44.39]I keep feeling something terrible is about to happen.
[16:46.69]Nice.
[16:46.85]Blaster, blaster.
[16:47.31]Who are you?
[16:49.61]Whoa, whoa, there it is, there it is.
[16:52.07]They say you're the bad guy.
[16:54.20]That's... Oh, he broke his back!
[16:56.82]I was wrong.
[16:58.80]Whoa!
[17:06.84]Holy shit.
[17:08.02]I would never let anything happen to you.
[17:11.34]It's about to get very cold in here.
[17:14.52]Very cold in here.
[17:15.46]I need you to read my mind.
[17:18.50]Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.
[17:23.96]They say you're the bad guy.
[17:26.86]Where is it?
[17:27.42]God damn it.
[17:28.06]I couldn't find it.
[17:28.76]I was trying just to play that most people would never know anything over that.
[17:35.94]I can't find it.
[17:48.73]Hold on.
[17:52.39]No, they pretended that scene doesn't exist.
[17:57.08]The fight scene is the only one that exists, and it's like the coolest part of the whole movie.
[18:01.50]Well, whatever.
[18:01.88]The joke sucks.
[18:04.68]Joke ruined.
[18:05.26]Who cares?
[18:05.62]Let's go.
[18:05.98]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[18:17.89]Oh shit, I don't have any audio.
[18:23.81]There we go.
[18:27.01]Yeah, that scene I'm looking for doesn't even exist.
[18:30.39]Nobody capped... Why would anybody capture that scene?
[18:35.68]Are you having fun?
[18:42.22]Laughing my ass off.
[18:43.30]Next nerd.
[18:48.25]Alright, here we go.
[18:49.71]Let me just make sure all my shit's ready.
[18:54.01]My mic's not muted in my ear.
[18:54.99]God damn it.
[19:00.92]I was really hoping I was going to be able to pull that off.
[19:06.22]Too bad.
[19:08.70]Like, you can't get a base hit every single left bat, you know?
[19:20.83]I am losing patience.
[19:23.31]Where is the file?
[19:27.31]There's someone else here.
[19:28.47]They must have taken it.
[19:30.87]Those masks.
[19:31.89]Who are these guys?
[19:35.23]There's no one here but us.
[19:37.54]We will find the file or you will die.
[19:41.64]This is bad.
[19:43.02]They'll kill her if I alert them.
[19:44.10]Need to pick them off silently.
[19:47.84]Stealth mission in the stealth suit.
[19:48.83]What could go wrong?
[19:49.55]Hold on.
[19:49.71]Okay, we're good.
[19:50.57]Just one guy?
[19:51.03]Nobody at the entrance?
[20:15.84]Shoot webs.
[20:16.96]It serves as an object to lure enemies.
[20:21.32]Okay, find it at the floor.
[20:28.99]Okay, right there.
[20:32.47]What the heck was that?
[20:33.33]Alright, that's good.
[20:44.21]They always look so cozy webbed up like that.
[20:56.32]Don't touch the art silently.
[20:58.30]Should web him from above.
[21:09.58]This is it down here.
[21:12.42]Whoa, careful.
[21:13.62]Careful.
[21:14.42]Get behind an enemy for a stealth takedown.
[21:22.72]Real stealthy.
[21:23.48]I don't know.
[21:25.95]Which way do I go?
[21:26.41]Which way?
[21:32.01]You stay quiet now.
[21:35.59]I'm being hanged.
[21:36.67]Don't get warm.
[21:37.41]Someone's coming.
[21:44.81]Wait, can I pull her up?
[21:45.61]Whoa, hey, whoa, easy!
[21:46.21]Can I grab him from here?
[21:48.49]Bad guys getting ready to be bad.
[21:49.41]Okay, um, here we go.
[22:11.21]That's safe for a take.
[22:12.09]Enemies with danger icons will cause you to be detected by nearby enemies if they are attacked.
[22:17.43]You can lure enemies by webbing nearby surfaces or objects to cause a distraction.
[22:22.85]Okay, so you mean like do this.
[22:27.11]Hold L2 to aim at it.
[22:28.01]I was just aiming at it.
[22:28.77]Okay, cool.
[22:41.51]Why don't you come over here?
[22:46.35]Oh, it wants you to... Okay, it wanted me to do the different... I wanted to pull him up.
[22:56.42]Hey, what is that?
[22:59.62]What is that?
[23:00.02]It's a camera?
[23:02.44]Oh, I get a better camera now.
[23:03.50]HD.
[23:04.04]Don't move.
[23:07.44]Buddy, if I had a nickel for every don't move...
[23:15.08]She shot him in the head.
[23:17.22]This game is fucking gruesome.
[23:18.57]Holy shit.
[23:20.03]MJ, what are you doing here?
[23:22.85]Same as you.
[23:23.51]She is working.
[23:25.55]Brutal.
[23:26.67]I was.
[23:26.95]Oh, I think this is yours.
[23:30.49]Yeah, thanks.
[23:32.31]So Robbie's got you covering a break-in for the bugle?
[23:35.35]Well, Robbie doesn't technically know I'm here.
[23:38.28]And it wasn't a break-in until a few minutes ago.
[23:41.04]What is she doing here?
[23:42.92]Let me explain.
[23:45.88]But he found the Nightcrawler clip.
[23:49.65]Did you really?
[23:50.17]Give it to me.
[23:52.49]I need it.
[23:53.75]Hold on.
[23:55.93]Did you actually find it?
[24:00.35]How did you find this?
[24:02.33]I gotta get this on camera.
[24:05.06]Oh, yes, he did find it.
[24:06.02]Thank God.
[24:06.26]We'll watch this in a minute.
[24:07.16]I like to get a jump on things.
[24:14.13]Well, I don't.
[24:15.79]You'll have to come back tomorrow.
[24:17.31]Right.
[24:18.09]Okay.
[24:19.03]I'm sorry.
[24:19.45]Do I not play as Mary Parker now?
[24:26.62]No, sorry.
[24:27.22]It looks like we're going to have to run something else on the cover.
[24:31.90]Spoilers.
[24:32.84]Whatever.
[24:33.54]Spoiler alert.
[24:36.88]You know what?
[24:37.82]I think I can make today work.
[24:39.28]Are you sure?
[24:40.50]You're here.
[24:41.02]No moment like the present.
[24:47.84]Mary Jane and Peter Parker have had a longer not married relationship than Mario and Princess Peach.
[24:54.46]You're getting to those levels now.
[24:56.10]Just tie the knot already.
[24:57.06]Oh, Kaidu plays as her.
[24:57.80]Are you serious?
[24:58.41]Wow.
[24:58.53]Does she have moves too?
[25:14.01]Told you she was fucking badass.
[25:15.33]She's talking about like murdering sausages and she shot that guy.
[25:19.03]She has spider sense.
[25:19.73]See?
[25:19.87]She has powers.
[25:36.84]I remember when Fisk started illegally importing artifacts like this.
[25:40.70]He bought the local harbor to cover his tracks and laid off the old staff, including my dad.
[25:46.46]Wish dad was here now to see how the tables have turned.
[25:52.91]I don't want to... I guess I kind of have to.
[25:54.57]Were they?
[25:58.33]I don't know.
[26:05.31]Cigars.
[26:05.99]Did she just say Cigari- Cigaria?
[26:07.96]The company that makes cigars?
[26:13.08]You know, that's a pretty interesting take.
[26:14.22]Don't touch the art.
[26:28.76]Okay, what am I taking a picture of?
[26:30.91]This.
[26:31.03]Just get a ball.
[26:32.21]Quick.
[26:56.18]Okay, got it.
[27:03.52]What's the next one?
[27:04.02]You're not supposed to take photos in a museum.
[27:09.01]That's true.
[27:10.33]They would steal the camera.
[27:11.25]Well, actually, how would they get the pictures on the website?
[27:19.51]Somebody, that's such a bad photo.
[27:21.96]Wait, hold on.
[27:22.48]Look at that uncanny, look at that fucking stare.
[27:49.49]Oh my god, that's terrifying.
[27:51.41]Why is she frozen?
[28:21.10]How do I actually take the picture?
[28:28.97]It's a photo.
[28:32.43]Yeah, it's a photo, but I'm allowed to move here.
[28:35.64]Hide UI and then
[28:53.06]Have the peace sign go up under the tour guide's nose.
[29:02.04]I don't think I can make that a reality, man.
[29:04.96]I don't think I can get that to happen.
[29:07.29]I don't think that's possible.
[29:09.89]I'll try, though.
[29:26.62]This has to be perfect.
[29:28.40]No, we could be standing right next to each other.
[29:35.69]Notice the intricate gold inlay on this ceremonial tea set.
[29:39.33]It's just a friend in the DA's office mentioned that Fisk used art sales to launder stolen.
[29:44.60]No, maybe not.
[29:45.30]Let's see.
[29:50.33]No, she's going to be too tall.
[29:51.27]She walks forward.
[29:53.03]It's going to be possible.
[29:53.87]Got it.
[29:54.23]It's not going to happen.
[30:21.27]Wait a minute, can I move it?
[30:35.68]Ooh, I can.
[30:36.26]Hold on.
[30:39.56]No, shit her.
[30:40.38]She's not doing the peace sign.
[30:44.74]Whatever.
[30:45.02]Stand right there.
[30:55.15]What do you want me to do?
[30:56.43]Are you sure there's nothing you'd like to say, maybe off the record, regarding Fisk's activities?
[31:02.35]I don't think your readers would have any interest in... Damn it.
[31:07.79]Wait here, please.
[31:15.61]Shit, really?
[31:17.69]Can't go in now.
[31:18.71]She'll see me.
[31:23.84]That was My dear, I think it's time for you to go.
[31:33.81]Oh, um, could I?
[31:40.07]It's not gonna happen use the restroom real quick fine fall asleep
[31:49.62]You can't raise your hand up.
[31:51.44]This is the only time I'm gonna be able to do it.
[31:54.87]Only opportunity.
[32:26.31]Don't abandon the mission.
[32:59.54]I got it, look, I got it.
[33:15.01]Imagine somebody doing this shit.
[33:27.14]Where's the Vulcan?
[33:27.86]What's his name?
[33:29.16]Haha, very funny.
[33:29.66]Sneak around now?
[33:30.54]Didn't she just...
[33:59.54]Don't move, don't talk.
[34:01.64]When people are suspicious, a question mark will appear and they will investigate.
[34:04.24]If you see exclamation, you've been spotted.
[34:06.26]Huge story.
[34:07.28]What do you mean he had to reschedule?
[34:11.33]If she's not your reporter, who is she, Craig?
[34:13.57]Hold on.
[34:14.31]Was that... Wait.
[34:16.47]Was that... Never mind.
[34:18.81]Who is in my auction house?
[34:19.99]This fucking press smash a bunch of stuff.
[34:22.69]Oh my god.
[34:25.88]No, I do not trust you to fix this.
[34:30.44]Can I throw something?
[34:31.12]Go the other way.
[34:31.58]Holy shit, Craig's in deep shit.
[34:32.64]No, take a selfie.
[34:33.06]No.
[34:33.18]Statue opens.
[34:33.82]Time for a puzzle.
[35:03.15]It's probably something right here on the table.
[35:13.84]He's holding, uh, is that a flute?
[35:18.16]The Wilson Fisk Collection.
[35:22.20]It's like a flute.
[35:23.49]Okay.
[35:23.63]Okay.
[35:35.56]Damn it.
[35:35.96]I was trying to go through the door.
[35:36.98]Alright, so we got another thing here.
[35:41.06]We got this.
[35:41.58]Let's get the flute.
[35:44.97]And he also has his hand up.
[35:46.41]Latent power.
[35:46.87]Mouth closed.
[35:48.03]Left arm down.
[35:48.71]Okay.
[35:49.27]This is this thing.
[35:50.33]How do I get that?
[36:08.30]Secret behind the painting.
[36:09.66]Alright, so here we go.
[36:18.50]Let's do it.
[36:19.54]Mouth closed.
[36:27.12]Left arm down.
[36:28.96]Right arm is saying with the hand up.
[36:37.95]How do I raise his arm?
[36:41.29]Make him dab.
[36:49.26]How am I going to do that?
[36:50.54]I need the thing over here.
[36:55.34]Oh my god.
[36:56.70]I can't do it.
[36:57.58]It's not going to happen.
[37:00.54]Mouth closed.
[37:01.84]Left arm down.
[37:03.41]Right palm facing forward.
[37:07.97]I tried.
[37:10.95]Right palm forward.
[37:11.88]There we go.
[37:16.18]So that's this one.
[37:16.84]Give me this thing.
[37:19.14]Take it.
[37:19.60]And put it in his hand.
[37:20.60]What do you mean that's not right?
[37:39.56]No, it's the smaller one.
[37:40.46]It's this one.
[37:50.87]Why am I getting minuses for that?
[38:40.44]Is that it?
[38:42.24]Oh, that was earlier today.
[38:43.52]Yeah, that was a real boring story.
[38:46.02]Just give me the file, please.
[38:47.02]A simple, I got it, could have been nice.
[39:08.62]Good to see you, Pete.
[39:10.24]Yeah, you too.
[39:11.68]Not exactly how I pictured us meeting again, though.
[39:14.24]Funny.
[39:16.34]It's exactly how I pictured it.
[39:17.64]Ooh.
[39:22.51]How cute.
[39:23.43]Did she change her perfume?
[39:25.67]Focus, Pete.
[39:26.61]Focus.
[39:28.45]Zip to the ceiling.
[39:32.37]Quietly subdue the enemies.
[39:33.43]Okay.
[39:42.62]You didn't see anything.
[39:43.16]You didn't see anything!
[39:43.70]I do not hear this.
[39:49.82]We were nice and silent.
[39:51.16]We just broke everything.
[39:53.66]We smashed a bunch of tables.
[39:56.92]Nice and quiet.
[39:58.94]Okay, good.
[40:27.90]Oh no, I didn't mean to do that.
[40:30.90]I just made as much noise.
[40:33.76]Boy, don't do it.
[40:40.58]Oh, she just got the document.
[40:43.14]Here we go.
[40:45.09]Not cool with the hostage taking, guys.
[40:52.94]What is up with that glowy stuff on your hand?
[40:55.35]Are you guys ghosts?
[40:57.19]Never fought a ghost before.
[41:01.23]Ooh, it was slick.
[41:03.67]And so was that.
[41:05.37]Oh, no, that wasn't.
[41:06.11]That wasn't, though.
[41:06.89]That would have been so much cooler.
[41:09.75]I'm blowing it.
[41:10.75]All ghosts are specters, but not all specters are ghosts.
[41:13.37]You know what I mean?
[41:19.20]That's a -2 for Parker.
[41:20.96]Woohoo!
[41:21.46]Dude's got the gun.
[41:23.18]I don't want the guy with the gun to shoot me.
[41:24.82]Alright, we're good.
[41:48.60]Uh-oh.
[41:49.30]What was that thing?
[41:53.11]There, this guy clearly just picked that up.
[41:56.33]Yeah, we understand.
[41:57.31]You got to go in a party of seven to Diablo.
[42:00.53]You didn't do shit.
[42:01.35]You got carried there, and you picked up the fucking Stone of Jordan.
[42:03.91]Great.
[42:04.58]Good for you.
[42:14.76]Oh, fuck.
[42:15.22]That guy knows what he's doing.
[42:18.81]Wow, you can do that shit.
[42:20.43]What about this one?
[42:21.35]Activate!
[42:27.16]Oh my god, it actually just makes it harder to see.
[42:30.91]Can I turn this off?
[42:48.71]There's you, there's you, there's you.
[42:50.49]Yeah, I gotta change the suit.
[42:55.09]Alright, who is it?
[43:07.22]Look at the guy under the mask.
[43:08.20]Look at the guy underneath.
[43:09.14]I don't know who this is.
[43:10.32]Who could this be?
[43:17.66]I just talked to Craig.
[43:18.92]You are not the reporter he was sending.
[43:20.36]You don't even work for Heritage Arts.
[43:22.04]Never said I did.
[43:23.77]Hi, Mary Jane Watson, Daily Bugle.
[43:28.35]You will not write a word of what you saw here.
[43:31.17]For the record, what do you know about the file those masked men stole?
[43:33.79]Pretty shaky hands.
[43:36.21]What about the long history of stolen goods Fisk has laundered at this auction house?
[43:39.97]Your editor will be hearing from our attorney.
[43:46.56]You still have the masks on.
[43:47.87]That's so funny.
[43:53.55]Fine, but they got away with it.
[43:54.73]Sorry, I'll make it up to you.
[43:58.67]It wasn't even recording.
[44:02.25]Oh, shit.
[44:03.11]I forgot you don't just hold it up and point the Viewfinder at them.
[44:06.50]You press the red button.
[44:20.70]So where's, uh... Somebody said incoming cameo.
[44:23.85]Are we gonna get a Stan Lee here?
[44:25.11]Hey, catch.
[44:27.55]How's your milkshakes?
[44:29.83]They're on me today.
[44:31.45]Come on, do it.
[44:32.13]Be the waiter.
[44:32.67]So, how's the grind at the Bugle?
[44:34.13]Again.
[44:50.28]As soon as he reads the article you're going to write, guaranteed promotion.
[44:54.13]So, creepy mask guys.
[44:56.51]I'll just clean up after you kids when you're gone.
[44:59.19]That Spider-Man sure is interesting, huh?
[45:03.32]Do it.
[45:05.60]Let's not make this all about business.
[45:08.18]How's it going with you?
[45:09.44]Did you get that promotion?
[45:11.44]No, but we're on the cusp of something really big.
[45:14.48]You know Oscorp would hire you in a heartbeat, right?
[45:16.86]One phone call to hair... Sure, but Dr. Octavius' work will help millions.
[45:20.82]I'm right where I want to be, right where I should be.
[45:24.54]He's bringing up Spider-Man randomly.
[45:29.25]I've never heard you talk like that before.
[45:30.57]A lot can change in six months.
[45:35.35]Why did you ask me here, Pete?
[45:38.53]You know, just to... Is it weird that every time Stan Lee makes an appearance in a movie, I remember it's a movie and I don't like it?
[45:43.59]Is that what we are?
[45:44.78]I mean, you could be, you know, if that's what you wanted.
[45:47.32]The Stan Lee cameo, I understand it's great.
[45:49.54]He's a fantastic guy.
[45:50.96]But, like, essentially when you see Stan Lee, he just goes, Hey, by the way, this is a movie you're watching.
[45:58.76]Have a nice day.
[46:00.01]Does it remind us that we're watching a movie?
[46:04.65]Do you remember why we broke up?
[46:08.03]This is a trick question, isn't it?
[46:13.23]Saved by the siren.
[46:14.81]I know the superheroes do.
[46:16.25]We'll talk after the cutscene.
[46:26.35]So Captain America, right?
[46:28.63]Chris Evans doesn't take the Captain America mask off and go, hey, Chris.
[46:31.69]God damn it!
[46:32.57]You always were my favorites.
[47:00.07]I ruined the cameo.
[47:03.15]I ruined the cameo talking shit about the cameo.
[47:05.55]Whoops, I'm sorry.
[47:07.10]What did he say?
[47:08.76]Spider-Man, yeah, I love Spider-Man.
[47:11.92]Spider-Man is a good movie, too.
[47:18.44]Sorry, I ruined the movie.
[47:19.70]Just had dinner with my ex after saving her from masked criminals.
[47:23.78]He really reminds you when he does that that you're playing a video game.
[47:26.69]Right?
[47:26.95]That's what I'm saying.
[47:43.54]But what I was saying is, like, if Chris Evans took off the Captain America mask...
[47:49.04]And looked in the camera and was just like, hey, yo, it's me, Chris Evans.
[47:53.75]Hey.
[47:54.27]Right?
[47:54.67]Hey.
[47:54.97]And he, like, winked and then put the mask back on and they went back to the scene.
[47:58.69]But I know my friend appreciates you looking out for him.
[48:01.83]There's a lot of people who don't like him very much.
[48:04.75]That buffoon Jameson and his audience of sheep, please.
[48:08.69]Alright, I'll change the suit, actually.
[48:10.21]People like us.
[48:15.55]Stanley doesn't name drop himself in the cameo.
[48:18.59]I know, I'm just kidding around.
[48:21.76]Literally one of the most talented fucking people that has ever lived.
[48:26.40]He created all these places, all these characters, but... That's it.
[48:29.02]Alright, no, the Nightcrawler clip.
[48:32.56]Right, okay.
[48:33.22]Let's watch the Nightcrawler clip.
[48:43.71]The goddamn guy invented New York, right?
[48:47.01]He's fucking talented.
[48:48.01]Alright, let's put this on.
[48:58.39]This is called X-Men Trailer Best Movie Clip 6.
[49:01.85]Let's put it on the screen.
[49:19.23]Here we go.
[49:23.09]Because most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes.
[49:29.07]I did it exactly.
[49:30.23]I didn't even need to watch the movie.
[49:41.38]There it is.
[49:43.18]That's what it was.
[49:47.80]Compare it.
[49:49.04]Somebody clip it then.
[49:50.34]Somebody show me that clip of me saying that and then we'll play them at the same time.
[49:59.58]Anybody have it?
[50:04.74]I'm so sorry you heard that.
[50:09.45]I can see that says snort.
[50:12.63]I want to know how close it was.
[50:22.79]Because most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes anything because okay, hold on Anybody got it because I'm gonna put it up here and we're gonna do at the same time Is that that's not it I don't think anybody has it.
[50:48.58]No one has it Let me turn this up
[50:52.12]This is very important.
[50:53.10]It's an incredibly important part of the string.
[50:56.96]Bro, no one has it.
[51:07.86]No one has it.
[51:08.78]What do you mean you can't hear it?
[51:12.83]Because most people... Why is it so low?
[51:16.61]Why is the audio so low?
[51:23.78]Bro, hey, bro.
[51:29.91]Do I have to go find this clip?
[51:31.33]I might have to.
[51:40.50]What is that?
[51:45.20]No, that's Beater.
[51:50.30]Screw this nerd.
[51:51.46]I'm out of here.
[51:52.78]No, don't leave.
[51:53.43]Just wait.
[51:54.55]Somebody will find it.
[51:55.23]Is this it?
[51:59.47]Compare it.
[52:01.79]No.
[52:03.07]That's not the clip.
[52:04.16]You're replaying... You're replaying the other... Etalyx, Etalyx.
[52:12.30]Look, Etalyx can be just... Look at Etalyx.
[52:16.69]Right?
[52:16.91]Like, this is it, right?
[52:18.45]Compare it.
[52:19.66]Me saying that, and then... No, that's wrong.
[52:23.12]You got it wrong.
[52:29.64]Alright, we can't, we're not going to be able to do it.
[52:31.70]It's too hard to find it.
[52:35.11]Just know that I tried.
[52:45.32]Alright, nevermind.
[52:48.60]Wait, this?
[52:49.02]Someone's gotta... Not the clip.
[52:53.08]We're not doing that again.
[52:57.08]This is the one.
[52:57.84]I'm not clicking that.
[52:58.54]It's a YouTube link.
[53:02.54]Alright, that's enough.
[53:03.60]That's it.
[53:06.20]What?
[53:07.10]I could just do it right now.
[53:08.76]Why do I need a clip?
[53:09.90]Why do I need audio from in the past?
[53:12.30]I could just do it now.
[53:14.08]I could just do it right now.
[53:21.50]Why would I need someone to do that?
[53:24.33]Most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes.
[53:29.91]Quit that.
[53:31.43]But then I was proving that I did it before.
[53:39.24]No, that sucks.
[53:40.30]I'm not doing that.
[53:41.16]I didn't have effort in that one.
[53:42.88]No.
[53:46.99]Yikes.
[53:48.10]No, that's it.
[53:48.72]That's it.
[53:49.08]We're going back to playing Spider-Man 8.
[53:51.70]There's no sounds here.
[53:53.06]God fucking damn it.
[53:57.79]Yikes.
[54:04.79]Alright, here we go.
[54:05.41]Let's go.
[54:05.77]Let's take a picture of this.
[54:07.48]I got a person with the umbrella.
[54:15.64]Is there anymore?
[54:25.60]This thing?
[54:30.60]Why do they have to take a picture of a lady with an umbrella?
[54:32.42]Who the fuck is this lady?
[54:33.96]I don't understand.
[54:38.25]Okay.
[54:38.67]Alright, I'm changing suits.
[54:46.05]I don't like this suit very much.
[54:47.95]Because we have new suits anyways.
[54:49.33]Look at this one.
[54:51.04]Secret war suit.
[54:53.60]I can't make it yet though.
[54:56.12]Spider armor.
[54:57.04]Can I do the pajamas one?
[54:57.94]I can.
[55:00.38]So this is experimental AR tech spawns multiple hollow decoys that stun attacking enemies before decaying.
[55:06.22]Uh, yeah.
[55:10.18]Suit power.
[55:10.66]I'm going to try the suit power.
[55:12.06]That sounds pretty cool.
[55:16.61]Long range scanner.
[55:21.04]Increase XP from defeating enemies.
[55:23.46]Perfect dodge temporarily increases damage.
[55:35.83]What the hell was that?
[55:42.79]I couldn't control that.
[55:44.10]That just shot out of my mouth and my stomach.
[55:49.12]Jesus, that like hurt.
[55:53.14]That's a drunk fucking mouse from the Looney Tunes.
[55:57.51]Why did that happen?
[56:05.03]Alright.
[56:08.21]Fuck me.
[56:09.60]What was I doing?
[56:14.21]Perfect dodge.
[56:16.59]I have the pajamas on.
[56:17.51]Who cares?
[56:18.99]Perfect dodge makes me do more damage.
[56:21.29]So, do I want incoming melee?
[56:25.07]Reduce damage, reduce damage, and generate focus.
[56:33.00]I'll keep these for now.
[56:38.46]Turn the camera off.
[56:41.22]And, let's go back to what we were doing.
[56:46.69]That was as if somebody was choking me with two hands, and then they let go after 30 seconds.
[56:50.90]Alright, where we going?
[56:56.00]Over here.
[57:01.96]Why are you a little... I just got Homer Simpson'd.
[57:13.71]Why am I not doing tricks?
[57:20.01]Does anybody know how many front flips a person has done before they dove into water at the Olympics?
[57:25.66]It's like 30, right?
[57:28.92]They spring off and they go like... It's like 100.
[57:36.08]Am I not remembering this correctly?
[57:40.39]They go... They spin like a top in the air.
[57:44.05]Mugging reported.
[57:45.11]He's an officer on the scene.
[57:47.25]Verge on the east.
[57:54.38]Oh, it's Shocker!
[57:59.23]My best friend punched me in the face when we were kids because we both loved Shocker.
[58:05.35]And we had the Shocker toy.
[58:06.47]And he broke his Shocker's arm.
[58:10.89]And then tried to make it seem like... He was like, you have mine!
[58:15.83]Somehow after us playing with him.
[58:16.97]And I was like, no I don't.
[58:18.07]You broke your arm.
[58:18.89]Because the arm was kind of fucked up.
[58:21.41]And after denying it like a thousand times, he punched me in the face.
[58:27.85]But this could be so much more rewarding if we connected on an emotional level, you know, we should get in the air We can make it interesting Now let's talk
[58:57.19]They redesigned him.
[58:58.13]He used to look like a bee.
[59:01.17]So he's not a bumblebee anymore?
[59:02.77]Honestly, Herman, why are you robbing again?
[59:05.73]You know the police are watching your every move.
[59:07.69]I mean, we all know you're kind of dumb, but I didn't think you were this dumb.
[59:11.56]Kind of dumb?
[59:12.66]That's not nice.
[59:13.46]Which means you're not just stealing for yourself.
[59:16.62]You must be working with someone.
[59:19.02]Or for someone.
[59:20.68]You can tell me who it is now, or make me punch it out of you later.
[59:24.52]No, don't punch me in the face.
[59:25.93]I've already had that happen from Shocker before.
[59:27.65]Come on, man.
[59:31.99]Oh, he's shooting rockets at me.
[59:39.88]I didn't know that.
[59:40.50]Okay, got it.
[59:41.26]Figured it out.
[59:42.18]Watch out for that Spidey signal.
[59:50.80]That's what I gotta get.
[59:59.15]Come on, right there!
[59:59.99]I'm right there!
[60:00.81]Get him!
[60:13.13]He's like Mega Man with a power-up now.
[60:18.01]Like zero personality, but your suit is awesome.
[60:21.09]Can we talk design details?
[60:29.14]Well, it's rockers just as lame as he is in the cartoon and I guess in every other video game Good work Spider-Man.
[60:39.99]Did you learn anything about his motive?
[60:41.41]I
[60:42.07]I tried, but he's not very talkative.
[60:44.27]Plus, I think he hates me.
[60:46.01]You have that effect on a lot of people.
[60:48.45]But you love me, right, Yuri?
[60:50.37]No, I'm not clicking it.
[60:51.73]It's over.
[60:52.99]Wow.
[60:54.03]That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
[60:56.18]Alright, level up.
[61:02.32]Nope, some new side dishes.
[61:03.22]Looks like I got some free time.
[61:04.24]Maybe now's a good time to look into that mask.
[61:07.84]Oh, it's MJ.
[61:09.12]Oh, she's currently taking a photo.
[61:12.24]Bring it to me.
[61:13.14]Okay.

[65:02.47]I just put a bunch of you through hell.
[65:06.55]For no reason.
[65:07.27]There was no particular reason to do that.
[65:08.72]Well, yes there was.
[65:10.14]I needed to see it.
[65:15.04]All I had to do was turn the volume down.
[65:16.74]I can't interact with two things at the same time.
[65:20.15]Just be happy that I'm not going to turn that back on and try to change the audio calibration.
[65:24.98]You want me to get it perfect?
[65:26.30]I will lose a thousand viewers.
[65:29.48]I will lose a thousand people.
[65:33.42]A bunch of people here just want to see somebody play Spider-Man.
[65:45.45]Right?
[65:49.99]They are already gone.
[65:51.17]Have to go through the top.
[65:55.97]Go through the top bunk.
[65:57.21]Almost morning.
[65:58.33]Mr. Lee will be here soon.
[66:00.33]I could use a snack.
[66:01.63]Probably more like 2,000 people.
[66:06.59]They left a long time ago.
[66:16.61]Somebody comes over and takes a picture over my shoulder.
[66:19.50]Hey!
[66:32.50]Peter Parker?
[66:33.14]That's his name.
[66:42.73]Locate Martin Lee.
[66:44.15]Is he upstairs?
[66:47.11]Yes.
[66:50.54]Peter Barker.
[66:52.98]Take out the fire racks.
[66:54.18]Throw into room.
[67:03.30]Peter, what can I do for you?
[67:05.48]I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Lee.
[67:06.87]I have a friend, Mary Jane.
[67:08.11]She's a reporter.
[67:08.97]She's doing a story on art imports, and she found this piece.
[67:12.31]Really?
[67:13.35]She wanted an expert opinion on it, and I know you have a degree.
[67:16.39]And this might be the first time I actually get to use it.
[67:19.67]Let's see what you have.
[67:23.76]Interesting.
[67:25.46]He screams.
[67:26.64]Where'd she find it?
[67:27.42]Hides behind his desk.
[67:28.18]I'm really not sure.
[67:30.02]What is it?
[67:30.58]It's like that scary.
[67:31.58]An antique Chinese opera mask.
[67:33.80]I haven't seen one in years.
[67:37.52]This symbol here roughly translates to demon.
[67:40.18]Is there actually blood all over that?
[67:42.78]Don't wipe that off.
[67:43.84]The Alphonse's soul will go away.
[67:46.00]Let me go stories with that mask and symbol in it when I was young.
[67:50.19]Scared the hell out of me.
[67:55.71]Peter, listen.
[67:57.87]That mask, it's... It could be connected to dangerous people.
[68:04.73]Mary Jane might want to find a different story.
[68:07.15]You think she's in trouble?
[68:09.79]I don't know.
[68:14.68]Why take the risk?
[68:20.60]Alright.
[68:23.97]So let's go investigate.
[68:27.42]The symbol inside the mask means demon.
[68:29.90]It really spooked Mr. Lee.
[68:31.60]Never seen him like that.
[68:33.12]He even said you should drop the story.
[68:35.44]Fat chance.
[68:36.37]Do you think Mr. Lee knows more than he's letting on?
[68:38.35]No, I think he just had a weird flashback or something.
[68:41.89]I know his childhood was pretty traumatic.
[68:44.01]Yeah, that makes sense.
[68:46.25]Demons, huh?
[68:47.33]Catchy name.
[68:48.51]Okay, gotta get writing.
[68:49.69]See you soon.
[68:52.96]Well, that went about as well as I could have hoped.
[68:55.54]Which villain is he?
[68:56.42]I could patch these shoes.
[68:58.12]They'll last a while.
[68:59.60]I mean, is this really a spoiler?
[69:01.07]Like, Norman Osborn's in this game.
[69:09.97]I just tried to go over here.
[69:18.30]What the fuck?
[69:18.78]Where's the spaghetti joke?
[69:22.51]What spaghetti joke?
[69:30.08]Osborn doesn't turn into the green... Wait, he's not the green goblin in this game?
[69:33.56]Does it take place before Oscorp goes haywire?
[69:38.66]Interesting, that'll be in the DLC.
[69:40.44]You missed comedy genius.
[69:41.58]What's the checkmark?
[69:50.42]There's a checkmark.
[69:50.98]Is there a person of interest here?
[69:53.20]Oh, wait.
[69:55.26]Hold on.
[69:56.34]Who's walking?
[69:56.88]Is it this person?
[69:58.68]Hello?
[70:01.68]Is somebody walking around?
[70:04.47]Where is this person?
[70:05.33]They're running away from me.
[70:12.33]How?
[70:12.73]Why are we playing this?
[70:16.79]It's just the building.
[70:20.53]I ain't never seen a check mark before.
[70:21.95]Criminal activity.
[70:28.14]Peter, Mr. Lee spoke to me.
[70:30.26]He seemed worried.
[70:32.42]Are you into something dangerous?
[70:34.49]Oh, it's just a story Mary Jane's investigating.
[70:37.34]Don't worry.
[70:38.00]I'll make sure she's careful.
[70:39.36]Nope, they're there.
[70:39.88]Please tell me you two are back together.
[70:41.62]Sleep it off.
[70:42.26]We're talking again.
[70:43.06]Baby steps.
[70:45.52]I hope I didn't upset Mr. Lee.
[70:47.66]Three objects.
[70:49.36]Like that.
[70:50.52]And like that.
[70:51.92]I didn't like you.
[70:52.80]He admires how dedicated you are to helping others.
[70:57.20]One, two, three.
[71:00.87]You're both so smart.
[71:02.63]Well, the admiration's mutual.
[71:04.47]You've got a good boss, Mae.
[71:06.47]I'll tell him you said so.
[71:07.97]I love you, Peter.
[71:11.72]Oops, sorry.
[71:12.36]I just ruined somebody's business.
[71:21.98]Hello?
[71:23.76]It's Doc Otto.
[71:25.53]Oh, hey.
[71:25.91]What's up?
[71:27.21]Lance Corporal Texador is here for a fitting.
[71:29.70]Cars are expensive?
[71:33.45]Yeah, if you get a new car, don't ever get a new car.
[71:44.43]Yeah, okay, you know what?
[71:48.96]I took enough time.
[71:50.12]Let's take some photos and get some backpacks.
[71:51.70]These are usually bad guys.
[71:54.34]Why are they not bad guys?
[71:57.26]Oh, well, that guy was on the ground.
[71:59.49]Right?
[71:59.61]That clearly was I'm being attacked, right?
[72:03.59]Apparently not.
[72:09.47]He just said I was late.
[72:13.07]Well, it... It's okay.
[72:17.32]This is a hideout.
[72:18.92]Oh, I already did this.
[72:19.94]Never mind.
[72:29.89]One, two, three, four.
[72:31.71]Got it.
[72:33.83]Take this photo.
[72:34.50]Can I get a photo in the air?
[72:38.92]No, I can't.
[72:42.18]Bingo.
[72:43.20]Perfect.
[72:44.06]Washington Square Park.
[72:47.04]Are we in danger?
[72:47.82]They got the guy playing the instrument.
[72:54.60]I killed that lady.
[72:55.46]Oh, no, never mind.
[72:56.78]I thought I just photo killed her.
[73:04.96]Can I get like a photo?
[73:06.24]Hold on.
[73:06.60]I got a gun!
[73:08.80]What the fuck?
[73:10.36]Well, that was fun.
[73:15.16]Let's go.
[73:15.64]Let's get out of here.
[73:38.03]Oh no, he's going to do that the entire game now.
[73:40.41]No, I'm not.
[73:41.64]I'm not going to abuse that.
[73:42.66]I think I just try to get my attention, but Spider-Man's a busy dude, man.
[73:52.04]Come on.
[74:00.91]Come on.
[74:02.07]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[74:03.21]We got a backpack situation over here.
[74:11.25]He thinks this is our first stream.
[74:12.85]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[74:14.53]I'll do it probably like 10 to 20 more times over the next 20 to 30 minutes.
[74:24.10]Damn it, what?
[74:25.03]It's right there.
[74:38.85]It is classic web shooter.
[74:40.83]Hey, my Mark 1 web shooters.
[74:43.73]Managed to improve the storage capacity a lot since then, but the basic design is still the same.
[74:49.49]They sell this in the party store now, you know, Spider-Man.
[74:53.41]And boy, is it fun.
[74:54.97]You put the can of silly string in there and you hold the thing down the tab.
[74:57.51]Alright, let's go.
[75:06.52]Yeah, they do.
[75:07.00]It's in the party store.
[75:19.41]Ooh, almost touched the ground.
[75:20.57]That's okay.
[75:25.17]I remember having those.
[75:25.89]That was so much fun.
[75:27.83]That was the most fun I've ever had in my life.
[75:30.09]Breaking?
[75:32.71]Now, that's an overstay, but that's not the most fun I've ever had in my life.
[75:41.84]I mean, like, maybe back when I was originally using it, I would think that maybe, but not now as a grown adult man.
[75:56.12]That's me!
[75:56.90]Woof!
[75:57.12]That'll never not be funny.
[76:25.51]And that's it.
[76:27.77]Okay.
[76:28.31]I want to do the... this thing up here.
[76:38.65]Whatever it is.
[76:39.19]The police scanner thing.
[76:45.67]Why does Spider-Man know what a locksmith looks like?
[76:47.45]A locksmith is just a guy.
[76:55.50]I mean, I don't know how he would know that, but maybe he knew him.
[77:01.82]Okay, there we go.
[77:14.07]Before you die, Pete, can you sign this?
[77:16.68]What?
[77:28.09]locksmiths are a different species well that was weird just kind of floated a little corkscrew there that was fucking awesome
[77:50.70]Hi, Mr. Muggins.
[77:52.10]This is about the rent.
[77:53.90]Mr. Parker, it's called, sir, for your third and final warning.
[77:57.30]Eviction proceedings.
[77:59.00]Wait, wait.
[77:59.83]I get paid at the end of the week.
[78:01.07]I get... Eviction proceedings with our... Whoa!
[78:08.13]Good day.
[78:09.39]Yeah.
[78:10.33]Good day.
[78:16.97]That was definitely a puke moment.
[78:18.15]You're right.
[78:18.41]I'm sorry.
[78:34.21]How does the shoulder socket not go out?
[78:36.81]That is a great question.
[78:45.08]How does it work?
[78:46.20]Just like a natural arm.
[78:48.32]You think of what you want it to do and...
[79:07.20]Hey.
[79:08.14]Hey!
[79:09.14]What do you think you're doing?
[79:10.81]This site's been declared a safety hazard.
[79:12.19]Uh-oh.
[79:13.33]This is where he turns into octopus.
[79:14.91]Stop that right now!
[79:16.67]This is highly sensitive equipment.
[79:19.67]That's it.
[79:20.41]I'm calling the mayor's office directly.
[79:22.71]Peter Parker.
[79:24.53]How the hell are you?
[79:26.37]Speak of the devil.
[79:28.23]Mr. Osborn.
[79:28.95]Oh, please.
[79:30.09]How long have we known each other?
[79:32.15]It's Mr. Mayor.
[79:35.26]It's Norman.
[79:36.54]Norman!
[79:37.24]Norman, what do you think you're doing?
[79:38.44]The grant agreement you signed has strict safety provisions.
[79:45.27]This isn't your first violation.
[79:49.57]Those were excused.
[79:50.87]By me.
[79:52.77]We should have confiscated this equipment long ago.
[79:55.18]But... but I've had a breakthrough.
[79:59.18]Thank you for your great service to our country.
[80:03.48]These folks will escort you to Oscorp Robotics, where you'll receive the latest in prosthetics.
[80:10.53]No charge.
[80:11.39]This isn't about safety infractions, is it?
[80:14.45]I'm trying to help you, Otto.
[80:18.55]You're free to continue your work in a secure environment.
[80:24.28]At Oscorp, you always were the smartest guy in the room.
[80:29.88]You haven't changed a bit.
[80:31.64]Neither have you.
[80:33.84]Hey, Peter.
[80:38.30]Harry will be coming back from Europe early next year.
[80:41.50]Maybe the two of you can start that business you always talked about.
[80:46.66]This is opportunity knocking.
[80:53.31]Well, regardless, I can't wait to see
[80:58.14]If they actually go through the thing that they were potentially going to make a movie on.
[81:03.25]They didn't take everything.
[81:04.79]Maybe we could start over.
[81:06.41]No, we're not as far.
[81:08.05]Should be pretty fucking cool.
[81:10.77]Without the grant from the city, I can no longer pay you.
[81:16.18]I need some time to think.
[81:18.14]What's the buzzing noise?
[81:19.80]If I were you, I'd look for a new job.
[81:23.54]I don't hear anything.
[81:35.70]There is no buzz.
[81:42.41]So who turns first in the game?
[81:43.95]They're both in it.
[81:47.99]What is it in canon?
[81:49.31]Does Octopus turn first in canon?
[81:51.61]Or is it also?
[81:52.03]I wish I could do something to help Doc.
[81:53.99]Maybe call Harry.
[81:56.53]Ask him to talk to his dad.
[81:59.85]Norman never listens to Harry.
[82:02.05]Even tried to kill funding for his research stations.
[82:04.54]Who's funding?
[82:05.52]Trying to kill somebody who needs funding.
[82:08.20]Should see how they're doing while Harry's in Europe.
[82:09.74]Arthur funding.
[82:10.34]Yep, that's right.
[82:12.32]Must be some way to help Doc.
[82:13.80]Forgot about that.
[82:24.41]Oh, you guys hated that one.
[82:28.74]Harry left me a message about these before he left for New York.
[82:32.62]Pete, hey, I need a favor.
[82:35.02]My mom's pet project was research stations that could benefit the public.
[82:39.20]I launched them, but now that I'm away, Oscorp's gonna shut them down unless they prove their value.
[82:46.21]I was hoping you could watch them.
[82:48.33]I left details in each one.
[82:50.43]Thanks, man.
[82:51.99]As long as they're here, it's like a part of my mom has, too.
[82:57.80]Open research stations to get more research tokens.
[83:04.02]This is just collect coins, the game.
[83:10.07]And I love it.
[83:12.93]Snapping up smog.
[83:14.01]I guess that's what we're going to do.
[83:21.30]is another of our air quality stations monitoring contaminants in the surrounding atmosphere super important for the city and its citizens but certain corporate overlords are less than thrilled by the prospect of their pollution output being publicly reported
[83:38.46]I've got a couple stations measuring air pollution.
[83:41.02]The idea is to catch the, oh, what's the word, contaminants before they reach toxic levels.
[83:46.66]Between you and me, I think Oscorp wants this to fail because it might show they're polluting.
[83:53.01]The amount of polycyclic hydrocarbons in the air is way too high and rising.
[83:58.50]Is it a carbon man or something?
[83:59.56]Collect contaminants.
[84:00.66]Okay.
[84:00.76]Swing through the smog.
[84:01.24]I don't have a gas mask or anything?
[84:02.18]Is there a little finite amount of that to go through there?
[84:29.47]I gotta go higher up here.
[84:37.13]Climb up.
[84:39.39]This is just... This is gonna be so hard for me.
[84:41.37]I was so bad at the Mario flying level.
[84:44.49]Got it.
[84:53.33]He's up here.
[85:02.15]That one's gone.
[85:02.67]Need eight of these.
[85:03.41]Where's this one?
[85:04.19]Down?
[85:31.16]What the hell is this one?
[85:32.42]Oh, it's right there.
[85:33.00]God damn it.
[85:35.16]Get the backpack?
[85:36.24]I can't.
[85:45.64]Oh, damn it.
[85:50.36]If somebody edited in right there, if I was screaming and crying, that would work.
[86:00.21]Gross.
[86:00.43]This last one is... Oh, there's two more actually.
[86:10.75]Is it up?
[86:10.99]There's one over there.
[86:12.49]I'm just gonna get this one first.
[86:32.47]I must be freaking these people out.
[86:34.67]What else is new?
[86:35.35]One more.
[86:45.04]The toxin's coming from two types of cars and a faulty smokestack.
[86:49.28]I better get photos.
[86:50.92]Get photos?
[86:58.25]Take it.
[86:58.65]Take the photo.
[86:59.83]Take it!
[87:18.80]I didn't think that was possible with such grace.
[87:54.51]Perfect.
[87:55.03]Got it.
[87:57.03]What happened there?
[87:57.89]I didn't get hit by anything.
[87:58.80]What hit me?
[88:04.24]Now what?
[88:07.80]Very well.
[88:17.55]Up to the smokestack.
[88:18.87]Take a picture of the camera?
[88:20.79]Uh, yeah.
[88:21.37]Right, Jeremy.
[88:22.73]Take a picture of the camera.
[88:27.92]Just start inhaling?
[88:29.14]Okay, how many full inhales before I fall backwards and fall off the thing?
[88:33.12]What do you think?
[88:33.72]I'm gonna say one.
[88:34.56]You go... Your eyes would roll back and you'd fall off.
[88:55.88]Shacker.
[88:56.08]Hmm.
[89:16.16]Security footage the guard was in some kind of trance and it might have been the lighting but it looked like his eyes were glowing Did he inhale something from the smokestack?
[89:25.74]I just did that too One two three four five six
[89:43.55]I've been looking into the demons.
[89:45.19]Sounds like they've quietly established a power base in the vacuum left by Fisk.
[89:49.21]A vacuum I created by putting Fisk... Jameson was right.
[89:53.06]The demons are my fault.
[89:55.02]What was he supposed to do?
[89:56.14]Let Fisk keep god-fathering?
[89:57.70]Are you okay?
[89:59.54]You sound even lopier than usual.
[90:01.88]I think I might have just lost my job.
[90:03.79]The city, Norman actually, pulled our funding.
[90:11.65]Ooh, that was fun.
[90:12.59]Do it again.
[90:13.05]Oh, wow.
[90:13.19]That was fun.
[90:13.75]You know when something's just fun?
[90:15.43]That's fun to do.
[90:16.16]It just is.
[90:16.74]I don't care who you are.
[90:18.08]You'll get this.
[90:39.82]juggling that guy.
[90:44.06]I can level up.
[90:47.34]Might as well.
[90:48.50]Wrong side.
[90:59.45]Those pigeons were huge.
[91:00.81]They were very large.
[91:07.91]Yeah, the cops know I'm doing this.
[91:11.16]Didn't I ask permission?
[91:14.68]Landmark.
[91:16.80]What is it?
[91:23.10]All units, civilians are trapped following a vehicle collision.
[91:26.68]Nearby officers, please proceed to the Bryant area.
[91:37.70]Oh.
[91:39.40]New York Library.
[91:41.08]And we've got criminals.
[91:41.98]Alright, now let's just go.
[91:46.92]Wait, what?
[91:47.36]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[91:53.51]There's people in these cars!
[91:54.75]I have to save these people!
[91:56.85]Are they still gonna be here?
[92:12.43]There's somebody in here!
[92:13.51]Use my suit's power.
[92:16.23]Oh, it's just an arrow to him.
[92:46.74]Okay, now let's rescue the people.
[92:50.28]No, not yet.
[92:50.84]Okay.
[92:56.23]Are they- Are we done?
[92:59.95]He's alive.
[93:00.71]He's still alive.
[93:05.87]Alright.
[93:10.58]Save the people.
[93:13.44]Come on out.
[93:16.24]Who else need to be rescued?
[93:17.18]Guy over here.
[93:18.10]Oh, God.
[93:18.32]Okay.
[93:18.44]How do I... You're alright.
[93:19.30]What?
[93:19.52]Oh, shit!
[93:20.58]Wasn't there a guy standing right here?
[93:48.07]This guy's fine, apparently.
[93:49.17]He'll be okay.
[93:52.51]Now let's go stop Shocker at the bank.
[93:58.17]After... After I get the backpack.
[94:08.93]Where is he?
[94:10.03]Backpack, backpack, backpack, backpack.
[94:17.03]Down here?
[94:20.42]Aww.
[94:22.53]Thought I could grab it.
[94:26.55]Spider Tracer!
[94:27.25]Oh well.
[94:27.45]Cool.
[94:27.65]You ADHD idiot.
[94:28.43]Upgrades.
[94:28.99]Well, hold on!
[94:29.37]Oh my god!
[94:47.87]I can't just play?
[94:49.31]Hold on!
[94:50.31]Alright, what do we got?
[94:53.31]Quick recovery.
[94:53.87]Press X during a roll after landing.
[94:55.55]Launch into the air again.
[94:57.65]Useful.
[94:59.97]Zip a second time without losing altitude.
[95:04.44]Air marshal.
[95:05.02]What do we got over here?
[95:08.12]Webthrone knocks enemies down during the windup.
[95:10.92]Clearing the immediate air.
[95:13.06]Absolutely.
[95:14.12]I use it a lot.
[95:15.85]When throwing an enemy, rapidly press it and you can keep spinning.
[95:23.75]That's good too.
[95:24.45]Increase the dodge window.
[95:33.35]Might as well.
[95:39.41]So this is a punch and then you can grab and throw an enemy in any direction.
[95:43.45]I want it because I can throw people off buildings.
[95:48.11]So good.
[95:48.69]So now we're easier.
[95:52.21]And I can actually throw people left buildings now.
[95:55.79]Without having to do the move.
[96:02.66]I was going to upgrade event.
[96:03.66]I'm into running around and playing around.
[96:06.20]Alright, what do we got?
[96:10.40]Scarlet Spider suit.
[96:11.16]This one's new.
[96:14.29]This is the Tony Stark suit.
[96:17.50]So this one, you get a Spider Bro.
[96:19.54]Calls in a Spider Bro to aid in combat.
[96:24.81]Okay.
[96:31.71]Can I get this one too?
[96:32.55]I can do this one.
[96:33.19]Alright, hold on.
[96:34.33]I have enough to get any of these.
[96:37.17]Yeah, hold on.
[96:37.97]Which one do I want?
[96:40.41]Spider Bro... Distarges amplified EMP buildup to stun enemies and disable their weapons.
[96:49.96]Magnetically polarized armor plating makes suit temporarily bulletproof against all enemies, even snipers.
[96:57.71]Okay.
[96:59.71]I don't like that this one looks stupid.
[97:04.21]You look like a different superhero with this one on.
[97:10.06]Bro, bro, what?
[97:16.34]How is this one different?
[97:21.63]This one's just a deeper red.
[97:23.07]I want to try Spider Bro.
[97:30.32]I want to be Spider Bro.
[97:34.18]Let's see what we got.
[97:35.22]Increase the rate.
[97:37.36]Focus generates.
[97:38.50]Finishers generate bonus gadget refills.
[97:40.69]That's pretty good.
[97:45.09]Enemies take longer to detect you in stealth.
[97:46.89]I don't need that.
[97:50.66]Increases XP from defeating people.
[97:52.20]Perfect dodge.
[97:52.92]Temporarily increases damage.
[97:54.42]That's good.
[97:55.26]I'm going to put that on instead of this.
[98:02.56]Am I hydrated?
[98:08.14]Yeah, I got water right here.
[98:12.62]I'm good.
[98:16.21]So, I need base token and research tokens.
[98:20.51]deploy a spider drone which will seek out and fire an energy blaster at nearby enemies so I could do spider bro and this at the same time interesting this is by far the best power but that's fine I want to try this one first so I look uh this is the cartoon Spider-Man this is the one that I remember from the 90s
[98:48.65]Deep red, deep blue.
[98:52.48]This is from the movie.
[98:59.30]Do they actually have the original cartoon?
[99:01.78]This looks pretty close.
[99:04.53]We didn't update the mods.
[99:11.57]Could I?
[99:11.85]Did I have enough energy to do it?
[99:21.29]I guess I did.
[99:22.21]Okay.
[99:24.55]This one is four and two.
[99:26.95]This one is... I like this one, but I can't do it.
[99:31.00]Impact.
[99:31.40]Why is it locked?
[99:42.00]Web shooter refills faster.
[99:43.32]I guess this one's locked.
[99:49.99]Oh, I need...
[99:51.72]Level 10.
[99:52.00]Alright, cool.
[99:53.87]Let's go.
[99:56.41]Did I say blue as in jet blue?
[100:01.83]I didn't say it.
[100:02.31]You didn't.
[100:07.51]Research saw.
[100:08.29]I don't... Whatever.
[100:12.47]Oh, there's a backpack.
[100:13.47]I couldn't do it.
[100:14.11]The backpack was right there.
[100:22.50]Herman, long time no see.
[100:25.59]Hey, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's a parole violation.
[100:32.91]Are we actually doing a Shocker boss fight now?
[100:35.70]Probably.
[100:37.40]Oops, guess we're stuck in here for a while.
[100:40.32]Want to play 20 questions?
[100:42.62]No?
[100:43.46]How about we thumb wrestle?
[100:45.00]Okay, face punch it is.
[100:50.97]That's what happened when he did my friend did that to me.
[100:52.81]I did that same thing back We can talk science
[101:05.55]And here we go.
[101:06.05]Remember our first fight?
[101:07.79]Me so young and stupid.
[101:10.13]You just stupid.
[101:12.15]You talk so much.
[101:14.13]Well, that's a matter of opinion.
[101:15.85]I mean, are there any standard metrics for how much talking one should do?
[101:19.67]And who determines the ideal ratio of talking versus not talking?
[101:23.74]Also, how would you measure?
[101:25.92]Words per minute?
[101:26.94]Syllberger per second?
[101:28.50]Or is it more about how many words one uses to express a single thought?
[101:32.36]It's all so subjective.
[101:33.34]If you ask me,
[101:35.22]It has to be this.
[101:36.14]Is he going to lose that?
[101:37.54]Yes, is he?
[101:38.18]No, he's not.
[101:39.26]Is he?
[101:39.69]Okay, well.
[101:40.39]I definitely have to throw this shit at him when he does that, right?
[101:46.05]I got it.
[101:59.69]I get it.
[102:00.07]You just have to wait till he smashes into the wall.
[102:03.45]Ow.
[102:27.50]Jump.
[102:28.60]And, hey.
[102:29.86]No, fuck.
[102:35.51]I forgot to throw the thing at him.
[102:38.41]This is bro mode.
[102:42.75]What?
[103:15.56]No, people don't use banks anymore.
[103:18.66]You're lucky you found actual cash.
[103:20.96]If you really want to rob banks, try daydreaming.
[103:26.35]It's all the rage.
[103:28.83]No, let me use this horse.
[103:29.85]This is what he overcharges.
[103:34.94]If you tell me who you're working for, I can help you cut a deal.
[103:41.30]If I talk, I I'm dead.
[103:43.16]And make that very
[103:45.35]Well, come on, do the charge.
[103:47.41]Wowee!
[103:48.15]You did!
[103:51.78]Why don't I just go like this?
[103:52.62]Hey, fight all those people.
[103:54.26]Well, when he jumps in the air like that, you have to kill him.
[104:03.66]And... Okay, are those mine?
[104:04.56]What's going on here?
[104:05.44]Are those his?
[104:10.32]I get it.
[104:11.20]So, he's doing that for a while.
[104:18.74]Got it.
[104:18.92]Phase one, phase two, phase three.
[104:21.16]What?
[104:21.30]What's he doing now?
[104:23.54]Fuck, I'm trying to like rush it.
[104:26.25]That was my problem there.
[104:33.17]Okay, I need to stop talking.
[104:49.82]Okay, catch this one with your face.
[104:57.50]These masked guys.
[104:58.60]Let's go.
[104:58.92]What do they want the money for?
[104:59.92]Don't know, don't care.
[105:02.98]As soon as I finish the job, I'm gone.
[105:15.36]What?
[105:17.02]What?
[105:18.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[105:35.35]There's phase two.
[105:44.88]It's a shocker, Kimmy.
[105:51.24]You just work together with me.
[105:53.09]You see how strong I am.
[105:58.81]Okay.
[106:04.34]I wonder when I get a chance here.
[106:07.52]I don't know.
[106:09.06]There's a lot of noise.
[106:09.90]What's the noise?
[106:13.33]Holy fuck!
[106:14.27]Did you see that a few times?
[106:27.06]Get it!
[106:28.30]I'm stuck.
[106:42.96]I just pulled the... Okay, I have to do both.
[106:47.86]I thought I already did it.
[106:54.94]I thought there was going to be more than one object.
[107:00.79]I got it.
[107:01.15]I got it.
[107:01.53]I got it.
[107:06.53]I didn't see the other part of the chandelier.
[107:07.75]I thought it was something else.
[107:17.21]Man, he was scared and desperate.
[107:20.37]I can't believe the Shocker's dead.
[107:21.29]These demons are everywhere all of a sudden.
[107:23.16]He's not dead.
[107:23.90]He'll be back next season.
[107:29.04]Okay, now let me get these backpacks and shit.
[107:30.54]Okay, Yuri.
[107:30.96]Shocker's all yours now.
[107:32.80]Good work.
[107:33.52]We have a special cell waiting for him at the raft.
[107:35.84]We'll make sure he stays behind bars this time.
[107:38.79]Is that Electro in the top right?
[107:39.87]I'm pretty sure he was working for the Demon Gang.
[107:42.41]Demon Gang?
[107:44.18]sounds like a daily bugle headline hey the bugle is a perfectly fine news organization not sure I'd call it well I've heard they have some really good reporters anyway have you had any more reports on demon uh guys with masks demons let me get back to you by the way apartment application when mj and I applied for this lease I thought we'd move in together instead we broke up I can be pretty oblivious sometimes
[108:14.14]Nice.
[108:16.78]I want to take this picture too.
[108:19.12]Alright, there it is.
[108:21.40]Let's take a picture over here.
[108:29.82]I wonder what it is.
[108:31.24]Get out the camera.
[108:37.48]The Chrysler building.
[108:40.83]Something else?
[108:41.25]Something else right here.
[108:48.92]Perfect.
[108:49.94]He's Simkari in Embassy.
[109:01.41]Cool.
[109:01.69]Level up.
[109:02.75]Double high five.
[109:08.03]Skill point.
[109:11.55]So, what do I want now?
[109:12.21]I think I want the one where you can spin them even further and further around.
[109:14.81]They're starting to cost him more.
[109:21.76]mmm no I need more this more damage when they're in the air and more focus I do it all the time so when you're in the air now I can hold that doc left a message
[109:37.73]Peter, I might have been a bit hasty advising you to find another job.
[109:41.79]I have a plan.
[109:42.63]Double high five.
[109:44.09]That's a victory royale.
[109:46.15]The indomitable Otto Octavius.
[109:49.23]That's great news.
[109:50.21]Hope his plan works.
[109:52.39]He's all the way over there.
[109:55.35]What is it?
[109:55.75]I just tripped.
[110:00.86]It's the first time I've seen that.
[110:12.10]get this thing activated.
[110:14.04]How far away is that?
[110:16.28]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[110:19.78]Oh, come on.
[110:21.42]What's this Smash Brothers brawl?
[110:41.94]Where is it?
[110:42.92]Right here?
[110:44.90]Yep.
[110:45.28]One more.
[110:53.85]The rooms in the building are all modeled.
[110:56.15]Uh, I guess so?
[110:56.93]What's that?
[110:57.37]Research center down there?
[111:10.53]Yeah, I'll do it.
[111:11.17]And I'm gonna take a picture.
[111:12.49]So I just need to take a picture from right here.
[111:13.57]I'll get it, right?
[111:16.46]Does the thing have the photo?
[111:18.94]Almost just missed a backpack!
[111:21.42]Oh!
[111:22.34]Oh, man!
[111:23.74]I meant to wash this gym shirt six years ago!
[111:27.32]Ew, ew!
[111:30.68]Test 34.
[111:31.39]Demons have opened fire.
[111:32.63]Multiple officers down.
[111:34.35]Available officers report to Turtle Bay.
[111:36.53]Over.
[111:39.86]Oh fuck, I went too far!
[111:44.34]I just wanted a picture!
[111:51.73]Where is it?
[111:52.25]It's right there, okay.
[111:55.74]I just wanted a spectacular photo for Instagram.
[112:05.60]So.
[112:05.94]I'm kind of standing right on top of this, aren't I?
[112:10.98]I am.
[112:21.61]Research token.
[112:22.73]Cool.
[112:23.41]Let's get it.
[112:30.97]Looks after the health of the New York pigeon population.
[112:33.43]Harry Osborn and Oscorp, that's who.
[112:35.11]Seriously though, pigeons are the number one vector for a ton of communicable diseases.
[112:39.39]This station helps us keep tabs on our winged friends before they become health risks.
[112:45.03]I might have to fly through and kill a bunch of birds.
[112:48.93]What is happening outside?
[112:50.38]Yeah, that's right.
[112:54.98]I got an MBA to test bird poop.
[112:58.26]Seriously, though, you probably know that birds carry diseases that affect people, and we need to make sure they're healthy.
[113:05.49]You know, I really wish I was there to hear your finest toilet humor on this one.
[113:10.80]Uh-oh.
[113:12.24]The pigeons are infected with a serious strain of avian flu.
[113:15.95]And it's already mutated to a form that can spread to humans.
[113:19.35]Okay.
[113:20.27]Harry's lab had everything I needed to make a vaccine.
[113:23.31]Gotta spread it fast.
[113:24.87]The pigeons will be like rats with the bubonic plague.
[113:28.05]My best bet's dispersing it at three major migration points.
[113:32.47]Luckily, the station told me where they are.
[113:37.71]Cool.
[113:37.99]Vaccinate the pigeons at the park.
[113:43.33]I will try my absolute best.
[113:47.35]Uh, I definitely have to take a picture of that building.
[113:54.30]I can't take the camera out on this mission.
[113:58.36]Why?
[113:59.36]Oh, well.
[114:00.66]It's that purple building, though.
[114:01.66]So I need to go.
[114:10.36]Up top.
[114:12.14]He said it.
[114:12.60]The Avengers.
[114:15.89]He did, didn't he?
[114:25.71]I can't just walk.
[114:26.91]I can't.
[114:28.21]That's just not.
[114:29.37]Alright, fine.
[114:29.83]I'll walk.
[114:40.53]Why am I lurching over so much?
[114:46.95]Does it count if I jump over this?
[115:02.61]I didn't mean to do that.
[115:07.80]This becomes a different game when you do it like this.
[115:12.32]I'm just a scary guy in Central Park.
[115:19.89]What happens if fucking Peter Parker gets to be like 80 years old?
[115:28.57]I'm gonna have to walk everywhere.
[115:31.01]My bones are all fucked up.
[115:33.20]That's right, it's me that keeps you all safe.
[115:38.90]Where the fuck is this thing?
[115:43.32]Oh, shit.
[115:45.04]I gotta climb that building.
[115:52.74]Everybody's changing the device.
[115:55.42]You'd be so fucking angry at this every day.
[116:01.67]What did that guy just say?
[116:04.22]What the hell did that guy just say?
[116:06.46]Put Shocker away for 30 years.
[116:07.50]Put Dark Ark away for 40 years.
[116:08.36]1, 2, 3.
[116:08.86]I still got it.
[116:09.76]I still got it.
[116:31.57]And that's why you wait for me.
[116:40.40]Just crawl up this way.
[116:43.30]There's a criminal on top of this fucking building.
[116:46.82]And I'm gonna get him.
[116:48.42]Fuck.
[117:01.33]70-year-old fucking man.
[117:02.47]You're talking to the guy that put away the lizard.
[117:08.63]None of you idiots put away the lizard.
[117:13.94]It's probably just a dead bird up here.
[117:17.98]Call the police next time.
[117:21.72]God damn it.
[117:22.48]I don't even know why I wear this suit.
[117:23.88]I can't even breathe.
[117:30.24]Just a few more yards and I'll be just fine.
[117:33.40]I'll be fine in like 45 yards.
[117:40.85]Don't look down, don't look down.
[117:42.17]I've done this a thousand times.
[117:46.53]My web is all dried up.
[117:48.38]I press the button and fucking dust just comes out.
[117:52.24]That's bullshit.
[118:07.48]Whoa!
[118:10.12]Where was I?
[118:12.96]Oh!
[118:13.12]I almost got it!
[118:14.42]Ugh!
[118:27.65]Hold on.
[118:28.07]Just a sec.
[118:51.22]Okay.
[118:53.86]Where do I go?
[118:54.36]I gotta go from here.
[118:55.22]I go down here.
[118:58.19]Alright, I'm gonna try and go for it.
[119:01.05]There we go.
[119:01.67]Ooh, that ride was quick.
[119:03.21]There we go.
[119:04.49]Oh.
[119:04.65]Ow.
[119:05.35]Goddamn.
[119:15.90]Oh, fuck!
[119:17.50]My back can't take this shit anymore.
[119:20.58]Where's the next place I gotta get out of here?
[119:30.85]That didn't sound good.
[119:33.95]Okay, right here.
[119:46.46]Just a few more yards of that.
[119:50.49]Okay.
[120:00.59]That was so... I'm sorry that was as loud as it was.
[120:04.56]He's still making this jump.
[120:06.38]Oh, I did... I did... Come on, man.
[120:09.88]What's the mission?
[120:13.14]We're losing people.
[120:18.33]I lost 200 viewers?
[120:21.03]200?
[120:24.21]Jesus Christ.
[120:27.51]What have I done?
[120:28.31]I have to put a vaccine on.
[120:35.30]Oh, I have the vaccine in my hands.
[120:39.48]We're weeding out the weak ones.
[120:41.22]Oh, God.
[120:43.69]Alright, I lost where I was going.
[120:45.11]Over here.
[120:51.92]Why am I not walking?
[120:52.86]No, I don't wanna... I told you.
[120:54.58]I don't wanna lose, like, another 200 fucking people.
[121:06.59]Why do you do this to everyone?
[121:10.97]I don't know.
[121:13.91]That's Terminal Velocity, right?
[121:15.19]You're dead.
[121:16.59]Terminal Velocity is 9 seconds, isn't it?
[121:22.09]So, right on top of this area, right?
[121:24.31]This building right?
[121:25.01]No, over here?
[121:25.61]I'm spraying... Alright, now I gotta clear the whole park.
[121:41.53]Yeah, it's 9 seconds.
[121:43.89]It's at least 10.
[121:45.21]Or 8.
[122:05.57]Making like bone crack sounds.
[122:10.90]Let's burst the vaccine here.
[122:11.98]That is also getting late, too.
[122:13.30]It is... It's just about midnight Eastern.
[122:16.24]Come on, spread it around.
[122:41.04]makes you feel any better I thought it was really funny I'm glad I'm glad you liked it I'm glad you liked it specifically I guess I could just fly through okay I wonder what Jameson will make of this Spider-Man spreads chemtrails seems like a good bet I like helping animals they don't call me a menace or shoot at me or anything
[123:09.81]On top of the gold.
[123:13.05]What Fortnite game mode is this?
[123:14.73]The Fortnite game mode is a new game mode.
[123:16.34]It's called Spider-Man for PlayStation 4.
[123:20.92]I don't know what the fuck they were thinking naming it that.
[123:22.52]It's weird because it's on Windows, Mac, Xbox.
[123:27.15]It's odd, but that's what it is.
[123:45.70]An hour ago I said something really sweet.
[123:47.94]And I'm an old fucking man.
[123:53.48]By the way, if you're curious.
[123:54.65]Those of you that are still here.
[123:56.51]Getting into the late night hours.
[123:59.09]We're doing this again tomorrow.
[124:01.01]I absolutely want to keep playing this.
[124:02.37]It is fantastic.
[124:06.19]So I'm going to play this again tomorrow.
[124:09.30]Because it's very good.
[124:11.00]And why would I not play it?
[124:12.86]And why is this not happening?
[124:13.88]Come on.
[124:17.16]Put the vaccine everywhere.
[124:18.18]What the heck?
[124:25.25]Right ahead.
[124:32.01]Am I going to beat it on stream?
[124:34.34]Maybe.
[124:35.72]If I'm still having fun.
[124:36.72]It depends on how long.
[124:38.14]How long is the game?
[124:45.01]I'm very clearly in this square here.
[124:53.84]Okay There we go This is the final mission I hit the car Alright, I can scan some pigeons How do you scan a pigeon?
[125:25.50]Oh, like that.
[125:26.10]Okay.
[125:27.04]I guess.
[125:27.40]Yeah, we'll probably... We'll probably end up wrapping it up here in, like, another 20, 30 minutes.
[125:36.68]Go for five hours and then do the bits and subs and everything.
[125:40.99]I think that's a good... I think that's a good thing.
[125:45.83]And then we'll do the same exact thing tomorrow and keep going.
[125:48.21]Okay.
[125:54.49]Check out the shipyard.
[125:57.55]That's one on the mini-map.
[126:04.19]Oh, yes it is.
[126:06.39]What are you talking about, man?
[126:12.27]Find a basketball court.
[126:13.35]Can you play basketball?
[126:16.30]That's cool.
[126:22.14]Oops.
[126:23.38]Well, I have clones back there.
[126:34.19]Find a basketball.
[126:35.13]Find a basketball court.
[126:36.67]I'm not gonna be able to find a basketball court.
[126:38.73]It's not that easy.
[126:45.20]That's pretty immediate, if you ask me.
[126:46.88]You know what I'm saying?
[126:47.82]Yeah.
[127:14.45]Focus bar fold!
[127:16.19]I don't know what that is, but I'm getting away from it.
[127:26.73]Oh, that was fucking cool.
[127:27.79]I just stuffed him into that.
[127:28.95]Where'd he go?
[127:39.16]Run here, run here.
[127:41.60]Oh, come on, what?
[127:42.38]I don't have any more left.
[127:47.47]That's cool.
[127:48.81]So that's that move there.
[127:53.29]That's why Spider-Man's better than the cops.
[127:56.13]And then they're gonna show up right now.
[127:58.89]Yep, there they are.
[128:01.23]Right on time!
[128:08.66]Do I like the game so far?
[128:12.00]So far I think it's the best game that's come out in the whole year.
[128:16.03]I think as of right now.
[128:19.75]This is probably my current favorite game.
[128:24.01]It's great.
[128:31.16]You want to talk about... This is unfortunate.
[128:34.10]I said the same thing about Bloodborne.
[128:37.12]Console exclusive.
[128:38.20]Only to PS4.
[128:40.28]House Flipper?
[128:40.76]Oh, I mean House Flipper is always the number one.
[128:43.94]This is number two by about... I don't know if house... Housekeeper is like an S. Or like an A+.
[128:50.30]This is like a D-.
[128:52.52]It's too far out.
[128:55.67]That's one.
[128:56.11]This is two.
[128:57.39]But if you're trying to compare the two, it's impossible.
[128:59.59]You up?
[129:07.90]Eagle 2 reporting in.
[129:09.20]Eyes on.
[129:10.72]What caches are the demons after?
[129:12.32]I need to take out Fisk's men and figure out what they're guarding.
[129:15.36]Wait, you like it better than Bloodborne?
[129:16.32]Well, Bloodborne didn't come out this year.
[129:17.45]I don't want it in Fisk's or the demons' hands.
[129:20.13]Snipers everywhere.
[129:21.05]Snipers everywhere.
[129:21.97]I need to deal with them first.
[129:23.39]Where are they aiming their guns?
[129:31.87]I guess...
[129:34.63]You know, if this was me and my friends, I would definitely want to just do it all together.
[129:38.90]So just everybody follows one guy.
[129:40.86]Okay, you're the guy that we're going to follow tonight, right?
[129:44.06]You point your laser and we'll point our lasers in the exact same place.
[129:48.63]And then when you work together like that, you get an intruder.
[129:52.79]One, two, three, shoot him five times in the same, you know, one, two, three, boom!
[129:57.00]He'll get shot like in five different places.
[130:02.10]Concentrate the fire.
[130:03.22]Why all this spread out?
[130:04.06]How can... This is not gonna work.
[130:05.74]Look, this guy's... If they had just been concentrating their fire over here, this guy would still be alive.
[130:13.72]Oh, he is still alive.
[130:14.48]See?
[130:19.76]That guy would still be alive.
[130:22.76]He's still alive.
[130:25.03]Oh, fuck.
[130:29.19]I was supposed to do this stealthy, wasn't I?
[130:39.56]If only you had concentrated sniper fire, this would be so much easier, wouldn't it?
[130:44.14]Excuse me.
[130:59.69]Don't mind if I do.
[131:06.97]Did you actually get that up here?
[131:08.29]Holy f***, man.
[131:11.50]Alright, watch this.
[131:12.08]Ready?
[131:13.86]Made it.
[131:14.48]Stay there!
[132:02.37]I did this so wrong.
[132:04.67]Ow.
[132:24.24]Get in there.
[132:25.10]Get inside of here.
[132:27.70]What?
[132:28.10]Is this blocked?
[132:32.44]Get the fuck in there.
[132:34.68]What are you doing?
[132:35.52]I want to go up here.
[133:08.17]Because there's no one to grab.
[133:12.63]Okay, here we go.
[133:22.10]I can't just like go in here.
[133:29.82]Go in here!
[133:39.53]Okay, now I can finally fucking fight these people.
[133:43.65]I'm inside the ground.
[133:52.59]I'm dead.
[133:56.49]Like trying to get inside the sniper places is just impossible.
[134:03.01]You- you can't like fit in there.
[134:05.61]And there's no way for me- you- I can't- you know, this is dead.
[134:15.64]I forgot to kill this guy up here.
[134:18.28]I'm angry about that last encounter.
[134:24.93]Okay, get back up here.
[134:31.15]That sniper has a guard watching him.
[134:33.97]We need to divide and conquer.
[134:35.53]There's a lot of junk scattered around here.
[134:37.14]A well-placed web shot could make a great distraction.
[134:47.86]Did I just knock it off?
[134:52.90]Did I knock it off the building?
[134:59.99]God damn it.
[135:03.51]Oh, come on.
[135:04.27]What?
[135:04.67]What?
[135:25.41]Alright, only two more, right?
[135:26.89]Up there.
[135:27.28]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[135:39.29]Can I grab him from here?
[135:40.85]Yeah.
[135:41.15]One more up there.
[135:42.31]Mmm...
[135:59.66]Okay.
[136:01.50]Literally.
[136:02.08]What do you mean, literally?
[136:03.20]Why are you saying literally?
[136:05.46]This guy was a pain in the ass.
[136:07.96]Wait, can I... Is he going to come out and walk down?
[136:15.83]No.
[136:17.13]No, he won't.
[136:17.61]I have to hitman this guy.
[136:30.95]Why are you guys all saying literally inherit, why, did I say literally like five times?
[136:35.45]Did I just do that?
[136:46.62]You literally did.
[136:47.90]Oh, Spider-Man did, okay, well, that makes sense.
[136:51.06]This guy's coming over here to check it out.
[137:00.72]Oh fuck, hold on.
[137:06.44]Alright, let's perch and grab somebody.
[137:09.98]That's what the game wants me to do, isn't it?
[137:11.67]I mean, I'm in broad daylight here.
[137:20.63]Fuck, I don't have any more webs.
[137:21.81]There we go.
[137:30.37]That's a lot of noise.
[137:30.99]I just made a lot of noise.
[137:33.67]Okay, whatever.
[137:34.13]I'm just going to wrap around that guy.
[137:35.71]No, I'm not.
[137:36.09]There's people here too.
[137:39.54]Should I throw the water ballad and batter... Should I batter this guy in the face?
[137:44.00]When he turns the corner?
[137:44.62]No, I'm going to make a lot of noise.
[137:45.96]What should I do?
[137:52.54]He won't see me, right?
[138:01.01]We're good.
[138:11.54]I think I should just do that to everybody.
[138:20.06]Oh, I just killed him in one punch.
[138:29.51]Alright.
[138:30.01]They're all going to be coming over here now.
[138:31.31]I'm just going to have to make a... Oh, not yet.
[138:37.14]What happened to me?
[138:38.28]I just got electrocuted.
[138:40.20]Water and electricity doesn't mix.
[138:41.48]I forgot.
[138:48.84]He's dead now.
[138:49.56]He's dead now.
[138:50.26]He's dead now.
[139:00.03]He's dead.
[139:01.75]Last guy.
[139:03.03]Where is he?
[139:08.81]How about you?
[139:11.89]One, two, three.
[139:34.74]Not dead?
[139:36.74]Not dead.
[139:37.34]Oh, you just made a big mistake.
[139:39.90]Not dead.
[139:44.01]Now he is.
[139:44.37]Okay, good.
[139:47.13]He's crying.
[139:59.10]You know we can't have vigilantes trespassing or doing illegal searches.
[140:03.96]Yeah, I know.
[140:05.46]Which is why I brought a warrant.
[140:07.64]From my arrest.
[140:08.04]So what do you say we do some perfectly legal searching?
[140:11.35]I like the sound of that.
[140:13.13]What's your name?
[140:13.61]I can summon pigeons, really?
[140:15.33]That's cool.
[140:16.15]Officer Davis.
[140:17.87]Call me Jeff.
[140:19.07]And you are?
[140:20.49]Uh... Peter Parker.
[140:22.39]Oh, fuck!
[140:23.37]My son's a big fan.
[140:24.25]Spider-Man.
[140:25.21]So, that warrant cover breaking down doors?
[140:29.07]Not without a lot of extra paperwork.
[140:34.12]Peter Park, ah shit, whoops.
[140:37.36]Web him up in the throat.
[140:38.16]Find a way inside.
[140:38.54]My name, Jeff.
[140:38.90]God.
[141:00.78]Found it.
[141:02.36]I thought you could do it.
[141:03.32]You're good.
[141:03.68]We're good.
[141:04.78]You guys are good.
[141:05.22]Yeah, you're good.
[141:12.86]His name is actually Jeff.
[141:14.06]Oh.
[141:15.71]I found it.
[141:16.05]It's right there.
[141:25.21]Can he swim?
[141:26.13]I feel like I'm in a horror movie.
[141:28.55]I don't assume.
[141:29.37]Being in the Spider-Man suit, I don't think he means... You weigh... 5,000 times.
[141:32.85]No, I get it.
[141:33.29]Ooh, a little shitty minigame.
[142:00.26]Stun gun!
[142:00.90]Genius!
[142:02.28]Capacitors in this are just what I need for an upgrade I've been thinking of.
[142:11.55]Oh.
[142:12.37]Okay.
[142:13.25]With the stun gun you can now craft the electric web.
[142:17.03]Crafted.
[142:18.83]Unlocked.
[142:22.77]Concussive blast.
[142:23.57]Discharge a pulse of Sonic waves that sends enemies flying.
[142:28.51]Electrified web that stuns target and arcs to nearby enemies.
[142:33.45]Cool.
[142:33.69]Because you just throw it at one person and it jumps around.
[142:41.34]Did you take apart his gun?
[142:43.40]I guess.
[142:49.12]That was slick.
[142:49.87]Electric web for the win.
[142:52.33]Gadget man, huh?
[142:53.78]You remind me of my son.
[142:55.54]Started taking apart the TV when he was five.
[142:57.84]Why do I have chlorine vision when I look at that light?
[143:01.17]Sounds like he could teach me a few things.
[143:04.69]Okay.
[143:06.23]Nothing illegal in plain sight?
[143:08.83]Kinda anticlimactic, huh?
[143:11.33]At first glance.
[143:13.69]Let's look closer.
[143:15.41]Looking for something specific?
[143:17.81]This yard's been here a long time.
[143:19.71]Food lakers used to use it back in the day.
[143:22.39]Gotcha.
[143:23.29]Those guys love their hidden rooms.
[143:25.09]Epic.
[143:25.93]What are you guys doing?
[143:26.83]Why are you guys epic?
[143:28.35]Sound hollow to you?
[143:32.54]I got a hidden panel.
[143:55.02]The conduits lead out the back.
[143:57.60]Look for another junction box.
[143:59.88]Let's see if my mask lenses can pick up the conduits.
[144:06.37]You guys are fucking disgusting.
[144:11.69]Alright, this way.
[144:13.42]Found this one.
[144:15.76]Do I need to activate this with a super zapper shooter?
[144:19.20]Did that work?
[144:21.40]Must not be the right box.
[144:22.98]Keep looking.
[144:27.74]Did that work?
[144:29.44]Wait.
[144:31.64]Am I looking through the wall there?
[144:38.83]What the hell?
[144:39.51]No, I didn't.
[144:47.28]Bro.
[144:54.48]By the way, thanks for the safe.
[144:56.84]Gun pull up.
[144:57.34]More detective work.
[145:25.48]I don't know.
[145:26.28]Thank you.
[145:27.78]Look for scrapes.
[145:30.86]Look for something that looks like a scrape.
[145:33.28]Mmm.
[145:37.90]No scrapes in here.
[145:43.60]Where could there be scrapes?
[146:00.38]Scrapes!
[146:00.54]Go on up.
[146:00.72]No, I'm gonna take a picture of him.
[146:01.87]Pull him up.
[146:02.99]He's going in the elevator?
[146:28.82]Oh shit, I wanna- I was hoping I could do.
[146:31.68]Nevermind.
[146:35.12]He wasn't ready for that.
[146:35.82]Is he gonna jump this?
[146:52.41]Nice.
[146:52.63]Parkour.
[146:52.86]Oh, here comes another jump.
[146:53.94]Jump box.
[146:54.22]Okay, this way.
[146:55.20]Up and around.
[146:55.60]I mean, I could test this one, but it's not gonna be this one.
[147:00.18]Whoops, I broke it.
[147:13.72]No.
[147:13.90]Up there.
[147:14.62]Down here.
[147:15.62]Around.
[147:15.92]All the way down.
[147:16.52]There's a box up there.
[147:17.98]Let's go.
[147:18.28]Open it.
[147:43.87]And what do we got inside this one?
[147:45.39]Do I hear 200?
[147:46.61]Yep!
[147:46.81]300.
[147:46.83]Yeah, over here.
[147:47.29]400.
[147:47.31]Yep!
[147:47.39]Is there another one right there?
[147:49.51]Yeah, there was one right here.
[148:18.16]Wait, what are you talking about?
[148:19.30]There was one right there.
[148:25.61]Uh, where the hell was it?
[148:28.77]It was, like, sitting right here somewhere.
[148:30.13]Ha!
[148:41.01]Look, the camera was like this the whole time, okay?
[148:44.33]And I was looking at chat, and I was looking over here because there was a second junction.
[148:48.05]You know what I'm saying.
[148:48.72]There was a junction box right over there.
[148:50.04]There was two of them, and I skipped one.
[148:54.62]Found it.
[149:08.17]I'm trying to cheese it.
[149:09.33]You can't cheese it.
[149:10.20]Just do it.
[149:11.24]I was hoping I could shoot it through, but I'm just adding extra steps.
[149:22.64]Outstanding.
[149:27.38]Think you can help me out?
[149:28.50]This thing's heavy.
[149:35.14]I thought I was going to do some exertion there.
[149:42.05]I would love to help you.
[149:43.27]See, unfortunately, there's not at least three people trying to do that, because what you can do is you can pretend like you're doing a lot of work, and you're barely even exerting yourself, and everybody else is working a shitload, so you lift your arms up.
[149:59.28]Here we go.
[149:59.76]Like, five of us are going to lift up the couch, and you just kind of pretend like you're lifting, but it doesn't matter.
[150:03.96]You only need, like, three, two or three people anyways.
[150:05.76]That's what I would do.
[150:20.69]Damn it.
[150:28.97]How do I... How do I do this again?
[150:32.66]What's the... What's the... Got room to maneuver here.
[150:47.20]Why couldn't I just jump?
[150:49.24]Anything you can do?
[150:50.43]No, I'm not pretending.
[150:51.37]I wanted to jump over that.
[150:53.22]Why did I have to climb on the wall like a weirdo?
[150:59.66]I could easily just get down right now.
[151:01.22]I'm making this so much harder.
[151:02.70]I'm going, I'm going.
[151:21.26]Hurry up, run!
[151:21.76]I wanna stand up straight.
[151:26.56]Not really that useful.
[151:27.88]Okay, if you were going for, like, a zombie apocalypse type situation...
[151:51.90]You're not gonna take smoke grenades and flashbangs.
[151:54.52]You're gonna take grenades and ammo.
[151:55.88]Haha, zombies.
[151:56.34]I am high.
[151:56.94]I got a drink right here.
[151:57.70]I'm good.
[151:58.04]I drank two full ones of these.
[152:02.26]It was like 24 ounces.
[152:02.68]I drank two of these.
[152:24.71]Can we open this?
[152:32.79]That's too much.
[152:40.37]No, it's not gonna take both of us.
[152:45.78]Like, honestly, this is a situation where you give your little brother the other controller, it's not plugged in.
[152:55.45]It's going to take two of us, man.
[152:56.47]You need to help.
[152:57.33]Okay.
[152:57.45]Let's go.
[152:57.75]Oh, that's the electricity thing.
[153:00.73]Never mind.
[153:02.54]Okay.
[153:24.44]Whoa, lots of people shooting.
[153:31.70]I'm a little impressed.
[153:36.16]So unrealistic.
[153:38.60]Yeah, you think so?
[153:43.36]Thanks, I needed that.
[153:45.76]That's so funny.
[153:50.18]That guy didn't even know what happened.
[153:51.44]He's still alive.
[153:52.26]Your timing is impeccable.
[153:56.07]I'm putting this guy through hell and he's still alive.
[154:06.49]See?
[154:07.09]I've got friends, too!
[154:10.55]That's cool.
[154:11.29]Alright.
[154:13.95]Incoming!
[154:15.50]He's helping so much.
[154:16.48]He really is.
[154:16.92]Stay clear!
[154:19.74]Actually, give me this thing.
[154:20.82]Let's cause a little bit of damage.
[154:46.02]It's clobbering time.
[154:48.08]That's the thing.
[154:48.76]I love that move.
[154:56.64]It's so much fun.
[155:04.80]I missed that move.
[155:05.40]Catch the van.
[155:07.40]You got it.
[155:07.94]Pull him out of the back.
[155:09.78]Probably.
[155:11.44]Keep the speed going.
[155:12.84]Keep the speed going.
[155:15.10]Almost there.
[155:41.70]Oh, we're so close.
[155:42.40]Oh, that's bullshit.
[155:43.30]You see that?
[155:45.70]They speed the fuck up.
[155:47.03]Look at how much faster he goes when we get close.
[155:49.31]This is a scripted event.
[155:50.15]God damn it.
[155:50.61]Come on, man.
[155:50.91]Really?
[155:51.45]Probably should dive down.
[156:16.43]That was a mistake.
[156:27.25]This keeps the bystanders from getting shot.
[156:29.15]I got to get in close.
[156:30.21]Punch.
[156:32.35]Hey, guys.
[156:32.79]Oh, what the fuck?
[156:33.41]He's shooting through the.
[156:34.14]OK, go on.
[156:36.80]Which way did you go?
[156:39.92]I don't know.
[156:40.30]Who knows?
[156:40.74]Here's your stuff.
[156:52.86]Let's do it again.
[156:54.18]What?
[156:56.82]What's going on here?
[156:58.56]I have to, like, tap square?
[157:06.29]Okay.
[157:06.75]He pulled his hand up and shot me in the face.
[157:15.61]No.
[157:16.71]I hope the other guy's alright.
[157:24.04]I'm kind of wasting time here though.
[157:28.90]I'm gonna get away.
[157:29.68]What the fuck?
[157:50.00]Did they just do... Is that Jeff?
[157:51.90]Of course it is.
[157:56.14]You gotta be kidding me.
[157:59.41]Why is Jeff so good at everything?
[158:02.55]He's gonna get his head run over.
[158:10.13]Jeff is really, really good at this game.
[158:12.78]I'm glad I gave the controller to him.
[158:20.46]We've now identified the officer as Jefferson Davis.
[158:23.92]We're being told he has minor injuries and is expected to make a full recovery.
[158:29.06]He's the best character so far.
[158:31.22]Excuse me, miss.
[158:32.03]Are you supposed to be here?
[158:33.75]More than you.
[158:35.15]After that auction house thing, the bugle put me on the city beat, which means I get to focus full time on real stories like this and the demons.
[158:42.57]You know the closer you get to them, the more you become a target, right?
[158:45.13]The closer I get, the better chance we have to stop them.
[158:49.95]We?
[158:50.63]That's a good call.
[158:52.39]That's true.
[158:52.73]Officer Davis, Mary Jane Watson, Daily Bugle.
[158:55.56]No comment.
[158:58.36]I don't blame you.
[158:59.24]Somebody named Jeff is now hosting.
[159:00.20]These guys are going to tell their story with or without you, and they thrive on controversy.
[159:05.52]So what's your end?
[159:07.18]I don't have one.
[159:08.67]I just listen.
[159:11.77]Okay.
[159:13.23]Up in.
[159:17.37]She's good.
[159:19.37]Very cool.
[159:23.39]Did I get a skill point?
[159:25.41]Maybe.
[159:30.35]That's exactly what I was going to say, Spider-Man.
[159:36.37]I'm going to call it here.
[159:40.20]Fast travel locations are now marked on the map.
[159:44.60]Hold X over Peter's apartment to fast travel.
[159:48.76]That's kind of cool.
[159:59.43]What?
[160:04.03]Why do I take the subway?
[160:04.99]Just ride the subway with everybody?
[160:08.55]I thought I was supposed to be incognito.
[160:10.84]Alright, well, that's fine.
[160:18.56]Interesting.
[160:23.14]I guess he's tired.
[160:30.98]He's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
[160:32.44]That's true.
[160:33.02]I guess you're right.
[160:37.62]Would Aunt May change the locks?
[160:42.30]Oh, I got evicted.
[160:44.64]Come on.
[160:53.82]Did I kick the door in?
[160:54.84]Is that what happened?
[160:56.18]I guess.
[160:56.74]Yeah, I did.
[160:57.84]Empire Sanitation, this is Eddie.
[161:00.09]Yeah, hi.
[161:01.40]I'm trying to track down some items that were accidentally picked up from a dumpster outside my apartment.
[161:06.14]Dumpster number?
[161:16.66]Uh, hang on.
[161:17.06]64476.
[161:17.18]He didn't really need to do the bathroom.
[161:19.36]That's Route 33.
[161:20.16]Truck's already left at shift.
[161:21.57]If your stuff's not there, you're out of luck.
[161:23.51]Wait, wait, please.
[161:24.55]This is important.
[161:25.77]Can you at least tell me where the truck is?
[161:27.49]Chase the truck, Don.
[161:28.49]Let me check.
[161:30.15]Alright.
[161:30.85]Looks like it should be at the Municipal Garage at Bowery and Grand.
[161:33.11]That was quick.
[161:34.03]Got it.
[161:34.71]Thanks, Eddie.
[161:38.41]Alright.
[161:40.47]Manual save.
[161:42.03]Might as well.
[161:47.00]Okay.
[161:48.88]Alright.
[161:50.12]So, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[161:52.04]Probably around the same time.
[161:56.88]That wasn't Eddie Brock.
[161:59.00]Was it?
[162:01.25]Tomorrow, we're also going to go Wednesday as well.
[162:03.41]So, trying to do three days here.
[162:06.27]Going to play Spider-Man again.
[162:07.75]It's a great game.
[162:08.77]I'm having a blast, so I'm going to keep playing it.
[162:14.25]So, thank you everybody for sticking around.
[162:16.85]We'll do the credits and the bits here.
[162:20.12]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

[164:56.25]I- I- okay, I'm gonna have to think of another solution for this.
[165:02.01]Because I have to sit on the maximum amount of time for the credits in, uh, Streamlabs.
[165:10.60]I think I'm gonna have to pull from that other thing that that guy made.
[165:13.42]Because this is too fast.
[165:19.56]I'm surprised he was as caught up as he was.
[165:25.61]There's a lot of subs.
[165:26.67]Two days in a row.
[165:29.39]The italic sub?
[165:30.61]No.
[165:31.21]Why is this off-center?
[165:39.20]Thank you, everybody, again.
[165:40.08]I'm going to figure out how to do this next time.
[165:49.82]Where I can actually read them all.
[165:57.08]There are a lot of subs.
[166:01.78]He'll look into it.
[166:05.63]Just take a video of the sub scroll and slow it down and then render it.
[166:13.61]That had to have been another like 200 subs tonight.
[166:17.55]Jesus.
[166:20.19]Do I have text to speech read it?
[166:22.55]I can't do that though because some people sneak in with like bad names.
[166:27.93]Text-to-speech will just read them Thank you everybody Means a lot thank you so much guys It seems like More and more every month every stream every other week The subs are just increasing
[166:58.46]Thank you, everybody.
[167:04.23]I really appreciate it, seriously.
[167:05.47]You guys rock.
[167:14.97]And I will say this, just in regards to kind of the plan until I, October 1st is when I'm gone from this place.
[167:24.88]So there is something, there is a stream
[167:27.25]that is going to happen here in the next two weeks.
[167:34.33]It should be a lot of fun.
[167:39.34]There's logistics that have been taken care of, and we're going out from this place with a fairly big stream.
[167:50.60]So expect one of those streams in the next couple weeks here.
[168:05.82]House destruction.
[168:08.06]I'm not going to break anything here.
[168:10.46]But anywho, let's get through the bits.

[168:17.65]But I do appreciate every single one of them though.
[168:19.87]Thank you guys.
[168:24.87]And why don't we stick this in the background here.

[170:58.93]FutureGamer, thanks for the $1.

[171:01.05]Let's see what it is.

[171:24.17]I didn't have to even tell you that.
[171:25.47]That's somebody else entirely telling you that.
[171:30.74]And it's as true as a statement as you could make.
[171:34.04]As a living human.

[172:09.99]God, imagine it used to be you had to try out for the baseball team.
[172:15.77]I wonder how much different things would have been if I had at my peak back in college.
[172:24.04]If there was like a TF2 team or something, that would have been so much fun and actually be able to compete.
[172:32.99]Peak.

[174:11.48]Why are you allowed to do this?
[174:17.72]This is so odd.
[174:23.40]That was wild.
[174:26.32]That's like the GTA IV swing set trick.
[174:31.18]Just in Spider-Man.
[174:34.44]That's so funny.

[175:40.45]Anybody got it?
[175:41.75]I want to see it.
[175:45.23]Thanks, Peter, for playing Spider-Man.
[175:51.75]There it is.
[175:52.39]Oh, okay.
[175:52.73]We're both trying to eat the peach at the same time.
[175:56.87]Except his is crazy, and mine is collected and calm.
[176:03.64]He might miss.
[176:04.24]I'm going.
[176:04.68]I know exactly where I'm going.
[176:09.06]Thank you, sticks.
[176:09.56]Thank you, Afterspace, for the $1.
[176:11.20]Here's something for the thumbnail.
[176:13.96]Something for the thumbnail.
[176:15.70]What the hell is this?
[176:19.95]Thinkgeek.com Plasma Pistol Replica.
[176:25.53]What is this?
[176:26.21]What the hell is that?
[176:32.19]Thank you, Kvas.
[176:33.05]Kvas Blackthorn.
[176:36.21]Blackthrone.
[176:38.49]Thanks for the $1.
[176:39.43]Urgent notice.
[176:40.17]Pay your bills, Jerma.
[176:41.11]Here's some cash to help you.
[176:48.80]You know what?
[176:49.12]That's true.
[176:53.57]I have to make sure that I close out all my accounts.
[176:57.00]Internet.
[176:57.72]Phone.
[176:59.24]If I have any bills.
[177:01.56]I'm still... Okay, thank you for saying that.
[177:04.18]Because I would have moved across the country and still been paying for a Planet Fitness person subscription.
[177:10.92]Like a gym membership.
[177:14.56]I would have just forgotten.
[177:15.45]I would have just kept doing it.
[177:16.95]So I need to go close that.
[177:18.01]Thank you.
[177:20.29]I gotta think about all those.
[177:24.53]What am I going to do about my car?
[177:27.30]Well, I'm not bringing it.
[177:30.60]I'm going to have to figure out to either get a used car or lease a car while I'm out there.
[177:35.90]I'm giving that car.
[177:39.42]My mother wants a new car.
[177:42.26]So we kind of talked about, hey, why don't you just trade a bunch of... You already have like two or three cars here.
[177:48.18]Just trade them in and get a new one.
[177:54.13]So she's taking that car.
[177:55.21]Because I can't bring, I'm not, I can't drive 45, 46 hours, man, across the country.
[178:01.07]It's not going to happen.
[178:02.01]And shipping a car across the country, I'm fairly certain it is thousands of dollars to send a car from Boston to Las Vegas.
[178:12.41]So it's just not worth it.
[178:13.77]I could put a down payment on.
[178:14.99]If I had like, if it's two, $3,000 to send a car, I could make, that's a payment for a car, a used car out there.
[178:22.65]You know what I'm saying?
[178:26.41]But we'll see.
[178:27.33]I'm trying to figure it out.
[178:29.48]Hire chat to drive it.
[178:36.36]God.
[178:37.90]Thank you, Spektag again.
[178:39.66]7, 8, 9, 10.
[178:43.56]Another 10 community gifted subs from Spektag.
[178:48.32]Thank you, dude.
[178:51.22]You're on fire tonight here with this.
[178:54.35]Thank you.
[178:56.22]and I'm just gonna say it not because I expect you to do it but I'm there's a thing where if you get gifted a sub you can re-up that sub for a dollar next month right or something like that just in case you didn't know it existed but thank you spec tech it's for this month okay I see
[179:23.53]Thanks a lot, man.
[179:25.83]Jack, or Jake TZ, thanks for the $4.
[179:29.83]Just Mr. Destructoid in the forehead.
[179:33.43]Thanks for the $4, man.
[179:36.07]We had another gifted sub here from Aki Monkey.
[179:41.14]Thank you for gifting the sub.
[179:44.80]For real, though, thanks for the $1.
[179:46.18]A couple of questions, Jeremy.
[179:47.18]One, have you managed to get Prototype to run on your computer or Prototype 2?
[179:51.88]I have not.
[179:53.30]Two, you said during a Hollow Knight stream that Glue Man was eventually going to get a sidekick.
[179:56.96]Any update on that?
[180:00.52]No, not quite.
[180:05.07]Both of those are both a not quite and a no.
[180:10.43]Well, Frank Pizza kind of was the sidekick.
[180:15.33]Wasn't he?
[180:17.92]But, uh, thank you so much, dude.
[180:19.82]Thank you Snooze and Copter for the $1.
[180:21.36]Being serious here for a second.
[180:22.64]No, not like something serious is happening.
[180:25.46]Not deep serious.
[180:27.14]I want to talk about the game.
[180:28.28]Uh-oh.
[180:30.16]Spider-Man on PS4 is great, really great, but for reference, we just made the yoga jog through the whole game joke.
[180:38.46]What I like so much about Spider-Man 2, and actually Web of Shadows, is that you could run and jump around the city.
[180:44.77]Not using your webs once, and it would feel just as fun and dynamic.
[180:49.49]Here, the only fun option you have is to swing.
[180:54.98]Yeah, okay, but hold on a second there.
[180:58.14]Wasn't there some power-ups or some upgrades down that tree on the right that allowed for jumping around?
[181:05.42]I specifically remember a talent point there.
[181:11.03]That was, oh, and you could jump and then jump immediately, and isn't that a thing?
[181:17.22]If that's not what that is, then... The walking he meant.
[181:20.76]Oh, okay.
[181:21.55]Just walking.
[181:26.99]But... Yeah, I mean, as a person who's obviously a big fan of these games... I'm talking about you.
[181:35.85]I mean, I love the Spider-Man games.
[181:38.62]That's my whole channel.
[181:41.52]I'm a Spider-Man-only game channel.
[181:43.64]On my main YouTube channel.
[181:44.68]It's a great series.

[182:15.09]You didn't like the Stan Lee cameo.
[182:16.87]No, I loved the Stan Lee cameo.
[182:19.21]I just... We didn't discuss it.
[182:21.89]Are you going to play the rest of the game?
[182:26.51]Yeah, we're going to continue tomorrow.
[182:28.51]Streaming tomorrow, same time.
[182:32.01]No, you didn't.
[182:37.25]I took him out of the game.
[182:43.91]The stream was over an hour ago.
[182:45.41]No, it wasn't.
[182:46.09]We've only been sitting here for like 25 minutes.
[182:51.11]But thank you, Snoop.
[182:51.77]And thank you, Anoniles, for the $1.
[182:55.61]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thanks.
[182:57.35]I run a large exotic animal rescue.
[183:01.12]Cool.
[183:01.46]And after seeing people treat animals like shit all day, it's great to come home and be able to laugh.
[183:08.44]That's a really, really interesting job you have there.
[183:14.09]And that's not cool, obviously.
[183:19.03]Animal abuse is really fucked up.
[183:24.13]But at the very least, there's somebody like you that is trying to help.
[183:31.22]So much love to you.
[183:34.64]And thank you for sticking around.
[183:40.12]Hey, Opt465, thanks for the $1.

[184:15.13]The Punisher.
[184:17.06]Yeah, but the Punisher is... The Green Lantern does not use a gun.
[184:22.38]Aquaman is my favorite superhero?
[184:23.84]No, it is not.
[184:24.38]He's my least favorite superhero.
[184:26.40]He, in fact, is the worst.
[184:28.26]I don't even need to go over this.
[184:29.38]We already did the whole thing where I did the swim shit.
[184:37.73]He uses the green gun.
[184:38.93]It's not a real gun, though.
[184:42.19]I have a bunch of Aquaman shirts.
[184:45.19]Yes, I do.
[184:46.47]Because I think they look good on me.
[184:48.87]They fit me well.
[184:52.15]They're very, very complimentary.
[185:00.27]Spectag again here.
[185:01.71]Spectag another five gifted subs.
[185:07.94]That's a lot.
[185:09.58]Thank you, Spectag.
[185:13.62]Like my Twitch shirt.
[185:15.58]No, I... Guys, I'm not going to wear another Twitch shirt again.
[185:20.00]We did the two days in a row thing, and that was like, oh, look it, I made the joke that I made.
[185:23.47]I'm not wearing one tomorrow.
[185:30.97]But thank you, Spectac.
[185:31.81]Thank you, FoxySoro, for the $4.
[185:33.81]Hey, Jerma, did you move?
[185:34.90]Love you, man.
[185:35.50]Not yet.
[185:36.86]I have a place.
[185:39.46]The lease begins...
[185:41.60]Beginning of next month.
[185:43.17]I just have to start the moving process over the next couple of weeks.
[185:48.67]Thank you, though.
[185:49.53]Appreciate the love, dude.
[185:51.63]Thanks a lot.
[185:53.15]Hey, BenXRules, thanks for the $10.
[185:55.59]Who are the best Spider-Man?
[185:58.76]Who are the best Spider-Man?
[186:01.64]That wasn't Peter Parker, the only Spider-Man?
[186:06.62]I would say Peter Parker.
[186:07.36]Oh, you're talking about actor.
[186:10.46]I liked Tobey Maguire.
[186:12.54]I mean, the third movie was stupid, but Tobey Maguire was a good Spider-Man.
[186:18.58]And yes, I am old, and that was the first one, and Willem Dafoe's in that movie, so of course I'm biased.
[186:28.65]And who's the kid that plays him in Infinity War?
[186:30.85]In the last movie there?
[186:33.55]He's really good, too.
[186:43.08]homecoming yeah that's true very good but thank you uh Ben x for the 10 bucks thank you also to five funky for the one dollar is Jerma confirmed for tip of the hats unfortunately no uh tip of the hats this year
[187:06.28]I've already talked to everybody that's there.
[187:08.82]I cannot go to Tip of the Hats this year.
[187:13.24]Because... That's my move-in date.
[187:17.77]We'll have to see, because... It starts on, like, October 3rd or 4th or something, right?
[187:24.39]It's gonna be really hard for me to get there.
[187:26.91]I'm gonna be just barely moving into that house.
[187:32.84]Because my lease begins on the 1st, which means...
[187:36.35]I have to start the process on the first.
[187:41.25]So then, one, two... I probably won't even get there.
[187:44.36]I probably won't even get to Vegas until the second or third.
[187:48.20]Because I still have to close here.
[187:51.72]It's going to be tough.
[187:57.50]But if for some reason I'm able to last-minute get out there... But I have to say no at this point.
[188:07.43]It's going to be a little crazy that week, unfortunately.
[188:11.13]But those guys and that organization has all of my love and support for sure.
[188:21.64]Stream without clothes.
[188:28.81]Why would I stream without clothes?
[188:31.81]But yeah, that's I guess where it stands right now.
[188:36.95]But thank you to CK Luck for the $1.
[188:40.69]I heard this guy was an AT.
[188:43.73]An AT.
[188:45.17]I heard this guy was AT.
[188:46.39]I don't know.
[188:48.73]What does that mean?
[188:51.30]Am I?
[188:52.68]But thank you, CK Luck.
[188:53.58]Thank you, Pocket Pauling.

[189:06.52]Foot Powder Spray, thanks for the $1.50.
[189:08.68]We're getting reports of a local streamer who's currently on fire with the jokes he's been making today.
[189:13.62]We'll have more on this later.
[189:14.82]Back to you, Tom.
[189:18.88]Yeah, thanks a lot, Foot Powder Spray.
[189:21.20]I was having a lot of fun tonight.
[189:22.26]I had a lot of fun a couple nights ago, too, but... I'm always having a fun time.
[189:29.29]You'll know when I'm not.
[189:30.25]I have, like, mental breakdowns on stream when I don't have fun.
[189:34.43]There's been like probably four or five times where I've not been having fun on stream.
[189:39.42]And you guys all know what they are.
[189:43.30]It's very obvious.
[189:46.44]I meant to say a Twitch streamer.
[189:48.04]The joke was that you showed the shirt, but I hit enter by accident.
[189:50.96]Oh, shit.
[189:54.43]I feel like you have a lot of mental breakdowns.
[189:56.47]What five mental breakdowns a year?
[189:59.97]I guess that is a lot.
[190:02.31]Oh.
[190:04.75]Morphy's Law and Mario Tennis.
[190:06.25]Oh, yeah, that sure, that was one.
[190:11.29]That's one.
[190:12.07]You're right.
[190:15.01]I told you that, though.
[190:15.80]I remember I was like, I fucking, this is stupid.
[190:17.56]I hated this.
[190:21.14]The Wolf game was the worst.
[190:22.28]That, I didn't, me and Etalyx were like having fun playing Overcooked.
[190:24.98]That wasn't a, we didn't have like a stream breakdown.
[190:33.21]But, yeah.
[190:35.28]Thank you pocket Pauling for the six dollars.
[190:37.88]Well, is this the streamer who became Picasso painting on the stream?

[190:56.38]My face that face was the thumbnail for my ira in like the irl category So it was just people like do an irl irl that face and then more streams.
[191:06.82]It's just so out of place.

[193:21.16]Hold on, wait.
[193:21.58]I read that wrong.
[193:23.03]No, I don't kill people.
[193:24.25]Spider-Man doesn't kill.
[193:25.83]Web slams a man down 100 stories.
[193:34.53]They'll be alright, though.
[193:36.38]This is the cartoon world.

[193:45.36]Doubled 11 for the $1.
[193:46.46]I would like a moment of silence for all the gamers brutally murdered during the stream.
[193:55.33]What, those guys that were on the roof?
[194:04.45]How's Vegas?
[194:04.97]I'm not there yet.
[194:05.67]Not yet.
[194:09.77]Thank you, doubled.
[194:11.69]Bottom text.
[194:13.53]Frexter, thanks for the $1.
[194:16.57]It's so nice to see when you have genuinely fun with a game.
[194:22.23]No, this is great.
[194:24.50]This is a great fucking game.
[194:25.66]Thank you GK9999 for the $1 here.
[194:28.92]Joke's on you, Jerma.
[194:29.64]There's a limited amount of crimes per district, so eventually they'll stop.
[194:32.44]Well, that's good.
[194:34.42]That means I cleaned it up.
[194:37.24]Thanks again here for the $1.
[194:38.38]You say the number of crimes is so high, though you won't hit it by the end of the playthrough, I can almost guarantee.
[194:46.11]You can still tell us how Vegas is.
[194:49.07]Vegas is my favorite city in America.
[194:51.59]So, I mean, I'm very biased.
[194:55.43]I love Las Vegas.
[194:59.36]That's probably one of my favorite places in the country.
[195:03.86]And very soon, I'm going to live there.
[195:14.21]Las Vegas isn't a city.
[195:16.87]What?
[195:19.94]What do you mean Las Vegas is not a city?
[195:23.15]No, it's a way, it's a way of life.
[195:27.27]It's a mindset.
[195:30.25]You buy a mansion, I can't afford a mansion, so.
[195:39.98]But thank you so much, man.
[195:43.80]Thank you, Criken, for the $1.
[195:45.56]No, Jerma, go do the homework.
[195:47.64]I was fine.
[195:49.74]Pocket Pauling again, thanks for a dollar.
[195:51.20]Jerma, it's okay, I support your drinking of cold brew coffee.
[195:53.62]Thank you.
[195:56.02]Thank you.
[195:58.87]Iced coffee cold brew is delicious.
[196:03.45]Hey Dark Star, thanks for the one dollar.
[196:04.85]For real, cold brew is the best, especially because I'm the kind of weirdo that will order it black and just add cream and flavorings at home.
[196:12.17]I just usually drink it black at this point.
[196:15.76]trying to get away from too much sugar trying to delete dairy and cheese from my life which is very hard trying to be healthier I'm trying to drink coffee black and not too much of it every day when am I going to do a face reveal right now sorry you have to screen cap that though I did it way too fast
[196:45.83]But thank you.
[196:46.21]It's time for slime for the $5.
[196:47.23]Hey, Jerma, expert swinging and slinging tonight.
[196:51.02]Recently finished watching Saturday's absolutely hilarious stream, and I'm happy to see you're now sponsored by several different companies.
[196:57.92]This is probably my favorite commercial of yours.
[197:02.06]I don't always... Oh my god, hold on.
[197:09.43]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[197:15.86]I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer those snackies.
[197:22.99]Stay thirsty, my friends.
[197:35.82]That was quick.
[197:40.28]Thank you, Time for Slime.
[197:41.42]That was awesome.
[197:46.25]Casey, thanks for the $1, Casey.
[197:48.39]Hey, Jerma, I gotta go.
[197:49.41]I'm going to watch Better Call Saul.
[197:51.07]Can you believe blank from Breaking Bad blank and blank?
[197:56.20]I can't believe it.
[197:58.16]Hope you watch the show and love it.
[197:59.88]Thank you, Casey.
[198:00.52]Thank you, Erdemius, for the $1.
[198:01.92]Back from tryouts.
[198:02.74]It went okay.
[198:04.62]No answers yet, but honestly, I'm not expecting much.
[198:07.38]I've never played competitively until last night, but I had fun.
[198:14.03]Well, I wonder... How many teams are there?
[198:21.29]Are there more than a few teams?
[198:22.97]I mean, how does that work?
[198:26.35]I'm actually genuinely interested in that.
[198:32.74]Interesting.
[198:36.96]Guys, this is the last day to fight against internet censorship that will affect every single one of you.
[198:42.12]Um, is it like a deadline here for the latest?
[198:45.84]Let me see.
[198:55.01]What's happening today?
[198:57.51]It's tomorrow?
[199:03.39]So, is that the whole net neutrality thing?
[199:05.69]It already went through, right?
[199:12.80]fucking ridiculous.
[199:13.58]Let's see.
[199:27.95]Online censorship.
[199:32.94]I'm looking at it right here.
[199:43.09]I wanna read this more.
[199:46.97]Save your internet.
[199:47.59]I don't know why they just wanna keep fucking with the internet, man.
[200:05.86]Every meme.
[200:08.04]Oh, no!
[200:09.79]No, no, not the memes!
[200:12.53]I can't take those!
[200:17.47]Hold on, this might be the last time we can actually ever see this!
[200:27.08]Now that's fucked up though.
[200:34.23]It's not meme- what if it was memes only?
[200:36.75]Can you imagine?
[200:42.64]That'd be even stupider.
[200:50.74]No, I didn't gnome you guys.
[200:53.79]Well, if there's like a... petition or a... site to go and... obviously read about that and... put your name down, absolutely.
[201:09.39]That's fucking stupid.
[201:13.61]Is this a currency thing?
[201:17.83]But let's get back on track where we were here.
[201:19.69]That's the dumbest censorship thing ever.
[201:31.07]God.
[201:35.28]But anywho.
[201:38.76]Start the revolution.
[201:40.72]Me.
[201:43.92]How long is this stream going to go?
[201:44.82]We're almost done.
[201:46.14]We're like at the last 20 or so bits.
[201:54.27]But anywho, thank you to... Where did we end up here?
[202:00.61]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[202:01.75]Just got here.
[202:02.27]I'm going to be disappointed if the entire stream is not a huge update video.
[202:10.88]No, it wasn't.
[202:12.93]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[202:14.81]Jeremy, you are a Marvel character.
[202:17.10]Marvelcinematicuniverse.com.wiki.
[202:22.30]Why did you do this?
[202:30.75]This is not... This is so inaccurate.
[202:32.95]Somebody has to remove that.
[202:36.27]Jeremy...
[202:40.83]Was the Slim Jim guy even in Ant-Man and the Wasp?
[202:44.37]What are you talking about?
[202:50.55]There's no Slim Jim guy in that fucking whole movie.
[202:56.66]Ugh, this is gonna cut me.
[202:57.80]People are gonna be like, I play the Slim Jim guy, I guess.
[203:04.44]What the fuck?
[203:08.12]Ugh.
[203:10.24]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[203:11.42]Thank you, Sticky Brick, for the $1, in case you were wondering how the pre-stream Boo raid went.
[203:16.90]There I am getting stuck on it.
[203:18.98]Eddie Jess, thanks for another 500 bits, man.
[203:20.82]$5.
[203:22.10]JetBlue's wide options consist of gate-to-gate fly-fi service, offering over 100 channels of direct TV, Sirius XM radio, and movies.
[203:33.50]And on the Airbus A321, a 15-inch interactive video screen
[203:40.13]Which is not available on the rest of the fleet.
[203:44.82]I feel like I should have said flight there.
[203:49.36]Here's the thing though.
[203:51.16]Hearing Boo read that out.
[203:53.94]Don't sponsor me.
[203:55.94]Sponsor Boo.
[203:59.13]You can read your commercial.

[214:23.92]Your Monster Rancher streams were so fun that I bought a copy of Monster Rancher 2.
[214:28.89]And I'm having a blast raising my rabbit ape.
[214:32.19]Named Slip Diggins.
[214:36.13]Do you think you'll return to streaming Monster Rancher?
[214:38.48]Thank you for everything you do.
[214:39.70]Words can't describe the joy you brought me.
[214:42.10]Keep being cool.
[214:45.56]First of all, thank you so much.
[214:48.61]I'm happy that you're even here.
[214:49.71]You don't have to worry about giving me money.
[214:53.15]And to answer the question here.

[215:05.21]It says yes.
[215:09.95]You will see Monster Rancher again.
[215:13.44]Just not immediately.
[215:15.76]Probably until after I get to Vegas and can settle.
[215:19.62]We still have that last one to play.
[215:22.44]But thank you so much, Piper.
[215:23.48]Appreciate it.

[216:15.21]Come on.
[216:16.37]Give me some damage.
[216:17.59]Holy shit, that was deep.

[217:03.26]Hey, do you remember there are actually other Spider-Men other than Peter Parker?
[217:06.69]There's the girl named Spider-Gwen, which is odd since that gives away your secret identity.
[217:12.41]There's Spider-Knight, who lives in medieval times.
[217:14.81]My personal favorite is Spider-Ham, the pig version of Spider-Man.
[217:18.31]His real name is Peter Porker.
[217:19.75]None of that's real, right?
[217:22.12]It can't be.
[217:29.32]It is.
[217:29.98]Oh God, it is.
[217:30.78]Okay.
[217:32.36]And Spider Pig is my favorite then.
[217:36.16]I am Monk, thanks for the $1.

[217:44.40]And Lazy Look.
[217:47.36]Lazy Look.
[217:48.78]And Topac is pronounced like the, like Tupac.
[217:52.72]But with toe instead of two.
[217:57.22]What is going on here?
[217:59.62]If you've confused me.
[218:02.58]Tupac and Lazy Look.
[218:06.06]Okay.
[218:06.86]Well, I'm wrong.

[219:31.23]If you dump that shit on plants, it's like weed killer.
[219:34.71]They'll disintegrate in front of you.
[219:37.45]You don't want that shit on your body.
[219:44.75]I'm not gonna scream.
[219:47.81]Hey, Oceans of Lotion, thanks for the $1.
[219:50.23]Jerma, my friend tipped me off to your videos and stream, and honestly, it took me a while to get it.
[219:55.71]But now you're one of my favorites, and I just sit with your videos auto-playing.
[219:58.79]Can you please explain the planets with your face?
[220:03.50]I don't know... Planets with my face.
[220:06.94]I mean, I didn't have any idea what my emotes were going to be.
[220:13.68]I had no idea.
[220:15.62]So I got a telescope and I pointed it at the different planets.
[220:19.28]And used the screenshot feature inside the telescope and uploaded them.
[220:22.84]I didn't have any other content there.
[220:25.58]When that was a new stream, I didn't know what to do.
[220:29.42]So that's all I did.
[220:32.85]But thank you, though.
[220:33.49]I appreciate it.
[220:35.23]And finally, to end the stream out for tonight, thank you, TheJack473, for the $2.
[220:40.09]Aunt May or Ant Man?
[220:42.77]Maybe Aunt Ant.
[220:44.61]By the way, that's a real MCU character where Aunt May gets an Ant Man suit.
[220:51.44]Aunt, Aunt, Aunt.
[220:52.48]Aunt Ant.
[220:58.10]Thank you, TheJack.
