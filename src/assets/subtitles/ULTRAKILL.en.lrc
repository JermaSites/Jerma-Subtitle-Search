[00:04.22]Hey, somebody said sup, loser.
[00:07.46]Sup, butthead.
[00:11.70]Hey, sup, butthead.
[00:13.99]How you doing, what's up?
[00:21.39]You doing good?
[00:22.49]Cool.
[00:25.43]Cool.
[00:28.56]you're late yeah alright no I'm not because you're not putting the Jerma 985 on time formula you're not putting the right variables in two o'clock means 2 30. you didn't put the you know parentheses uh like exclamation point 30 minutes right
[00:52.92]I've been pulling the time back to make sure that I'm here before 4 o'clock.
[00:59.42]Think about that, right?
[01:01.08]It's 2.30 p.m.
[01:02.40]right now.
[01:02.88]I usually stream at 4.
[01:06.40]We've pulled back an hour and a half.
[01:09.34]Look at this.
[01:10.35]Look what time it is right now.
[01:13.01]It's unbelievable.
[01:13.79]2.30 instead of 4 p.m.?
[01:15.89]An hour and a half?
[01:18.41]Are you seeing this?
[01:20.47]You've done this for one day.
[01:26.55]Let me just shake this up.
[01:30.28]What an accomplishment.
[01:32.14]I know, right?
[01:36.26]We got a lot to talk about.
[01:37.30]I've got... If you're wondering where I've been the last week.
[01:42.00]My head has been down.
[01:44.84]I've been writing.
[01:45.72]I've been working.
[01:47.38]On the phone.
[01:48.84]With hundreds of people.
[01:51.92]Minus probably like... 70.
[01:53.92]Maybe like 30.
[02:00.09]I've got some things to hype up to you now.
[02:04.55]One of them I can't talk that much about, but I'm gonna, because I don't fucking care.
[02:08.49]Alright, first things first.
[02:12.53]Oh, look at this list.
[02:14.19]Alright, first thing, are people here?
[02:17.07]Are we here?
[02:21.64]How many people are here?
[02:24.60]There's only three people here.
[02:26.64]I'm waiting until at least ten.
[02:30.25]There's only... There's three people there.
[02:31.63]I need at least ten people.
[02:42.66]3k Andy.
[02:43.16]That's a lot of fucking people.
[02:44.00]That's a huge amount of people.
[02:45.30]That is a massive audience.
[02:49.71]He's getting... He's washed up.
[02:51.53]No, I'm not.
[02:54.03]That is a massive audience.
[02:55.71]Even if, okay, even, okay, let's just say, for instance, that, like, for some reason, the next, I don't know, whatever.
[03:01.64]Don't make me think like this.
[03:05.28]5,000 concurrent viewers is a shipload of people.
[03:07.30]It's an insane amount of people.
[03:10.70]I would start to feel concerned if it was, like, I don't know, maybe, like, 1,000?
[03:17.63]500?
[03:18.01]Maybe I'd start to get a little concerned that, like, what did I do?
[03:26.53]Dude, you fucking fell off.
[03:34.40]Let's get it to 1k.
[03:37.80]No, you know what?
[03:38.60]Let's take a minute because there's a lot we're about to talk about.
[03:44.70]And I want to be able to announce them with everybody here.
[03:55.34]Give it 10 minutes.
[03:56.34]Yeah, I don't do a countdown.
[03:59.43]Ah, more fucking delays.
[04:01.07]Stop saying fucking, okay?
[04:03.89]Stop.
[04:10.17]Ah, this is so good.
[04:16.42]Oh, here's what I can do.
[04:18.04]For a second I was just saying... Oh, let's talk about my tweet from last night.
[04:22.14]I was... Okay, so I was... Let me give you some backstory here.
[04:27.31]So I was...
[04:29.37]I was kind of high last night.
[04:32.43]I had some marijuana products, which, you're at the legal age, and you don't go overboard, and you're very, and you do it in moderation, and you take care of yourself, right?
[04:42.50]Okay.
[04:44.94]I was sitting there, and I saw that there's this meme of monitors or something.
[04:50.85]It's like, what are you?
[04:52.23]What kind of monitor, the kind of Dungeons & Dragons kind of character are you, right?
[04:57.87]And I was looking at the ones where people put a monitor on top of another monitor.
[05:05.23]Like you have your monitor here and then a monitor up or down below or above it.
[05:10.52]And I was sitting there talking to Holly and I'm like, there's no way I could ever fucking do that.
[05:14.92]And I just started writing up a tweet.
[05:18.24]And I asked her, I was like, is this funny?
[05:22.69]Is this tweet funny?
[05:25.09]And she kind of laughed for a second.
[05:27.19]She was like, yeah, it is.
[05:30.31]So I was like, okay, hold on.
[05:31.09]I'm going to get up and I'm going to make sure this is funny.
[05:34.97]Right?
[05:35.31]Because I'm kind of high.
[05:36.83]Maybe it's not that funny.
[05:38.55]So here's what you guys tell me.
[05:39.83]Because I had to sleep on it.
[05:42.03]You tell me if you think this is funny.
[05:47.96]I can't do monitor on top of monitor.
[05:50.84]They need to be side by side.
[05:53.28]Can't handle that McDonald's menu bullshit.
[05:57.97]Is that funny?
[06:02.55]Was that like funny enough for a tweet?
[06:10.18]That was a little funny?
[06:14.14]She also did say it was adorable too.
[06:16.26]Aww.
[06:17.82]The idea is funny.
[06:24.52]That's trying too hard.
[06:26.34]But the thing is, I wasn't trying too hard.
[06:28.30]I was just kind of... I was fucking zonked.
[06:33.14]You do not try hard when you're zonked.
[06:35.62]I'm sorry.
[06:36.58]There's no like, oh man, I gotta do something funny.
[06:38.84]I just started writing.
[06:39.58]I was like, I think this is funny.
[06:41.94]So I'm not, I wasn't trying hard with that tweet.
[06:43.80]It was just kind of coming out.
[06:45.96]It's funny in theory.
[06:48.79]Okay.
[06:50.51]But not in practice.
[06:52.43]Okay, does that mean that it was funny, the idea was funny, but it needed some better, kind of more funny, maybe, language or something to make it funnier?
[07:01.68]Okay, what if I put fucking between McDonald's and menu?
[07:07.42]You know, for instance, if it's like, oh, they need to be side by side.
[07:09.90]I can't handle that fucking McDonald's menu bullshit, right?
[07:15.41]I think that might be funny.
[07:16.95]That might be actually a comedic take on things.
[07:21.91]Alright, shut up.
[07:22.43]Let's move on.
[07:24.35]Anyways, today we're gonna play... ULTRAKILL.
[07:29.98]It's a game that's been requested a lot.
[07:32.42]It's a FPS game.
[07:33.74]Seems like fun, I guess.
[07:36.36]It's an old boomer shooter, or that's kind of like in that realm.
[07:41.41]It needs work.
[07:49.78]I'm not ordering at a McDonald's, for God's sakes.
[07:52.12]That would have been funnier.
[07:53.08]Oh, hold on.
[07:53.81]Let's read that one.
[07:56.63]Okay, hold on.
[07:57.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:00.73]Shit.
[08:01.17]I think that might be it.
[08:04.15]I can't do... I can't do monitor on top of monitor.
[08:08.44]They need to be side by side.
[08:09.78]What was the joke?
[08:11.56]I forgot it already.
[08:12.58]What was it?
[08:14.66]So you have to write it again.
[08:15.40]I actually just forgot the whole thing.
[08:17.80]I'm like looking at my phone.
[08:19.84]I would get booed at open mic night if I was there.
[08:23.36]What was it?
[08:27.71]What did you say?
[08:30.27]Jerma, there's 10 people here.
[08:31.31]Make the announcement or we're gonna leave.
[08:32.75]Just wait.
[08:33.81]I haven't streamed in like six days, man.
[08:37.55]What was it?
[08:37.93]Okay.
[08:39.51]Okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay.
[08:41.92]God, I can't do monitor on top of monitor.
[08:45.02]They need to be side by side.
[08:47.36]I'm not ordering at a McDonald's, for God's sakes.
[08:50.41]Now that's worse.
[08:54.71]I think there needs to be more time before you get to the punchline.
[08:58.61]I think that's too quick.
[09:05.41]Hurry up and make the announcement.
[09:06.73]Guys, we have like 30 minutes of announcements.
[09:08.87]I'm not about to announce one thing.
[09:13.21]Let's... What is it?
[09:15.18]The line just isn't funny.
[09:18.58]Hmm.
[09:20.12]It's alright.
[09:20.62]Alright, whatever.
[09:21.75]You get the idea.
[09:24.85]Okay, what about at the end I said, it's Morbin time.
[09:28.69]I guarantee you, you'd click like on it.
[09:30.93]You understand how stupid fucking, you know, you understand?
[09:33.41]I'm sitting here trying to craft a fucking funny tweet.
[09:36.63]Trying to craft some comedy and observational humor.
[09:40.01]Nope.
[09:40.37]No, I just write, it's Morbin time at the end.
[09:42.64]And it'll get 100,000 likes.
[09:43.28]You understand?
[09:50.12]Actually, that would be kind of funny.
[09:53.14]Okay.
[09:54.12]Let me try that one.
[09:57.65]That's actually kind of funny.
[09:59.55]I can't do monitor on top of monitor.
[10:01.83]They need to be side by side.
[10:03.83]Can't handle that McDonald's menu bullshit.
[10:06.89]It's Morbin time.
[10:08.67]Actually, that makes it better.
[10:11.37]Why does that make it funnier?
[10:12.73]That sucks.
[10:13.47]Why?
[10:13.91]That's so annoying.
[10:18.17]Oh, there it is.
[10:26.12]I know it shouldn't be funny.
[10:27.30]That's annoying to me.
[10:28.68]It's annoying me that it's funny.
[10:34.36]It's annoying me.
[10:35.32]But that is funny.
[10:36.52]Damn it.
[10:38.13]Alright, it is funny.
[10:39.11]Okay, so here's what we're doing.
[10:42.07]Playing ULTRAKILL.
[10:42.81]You know that.
[10:43.67]That's what you know.
[10:44.79]But here's what you don't know.
[10:48.51]Submissions for the green screen actions are going to be closing this weekend.
[10:53.86]This is the first of many announcements we're going to be talking about on the morning announcements here.
[10:59.52]This is, you have two days.
[11:01.48]You have until Sunday night, Monday morning, maybe.
[11:10.37]Another like two days or so.
[11:11.45]I mean, it's been open for a week and a half or so.
[11:13.69]It's been open for a week.
[11:14.23]And there's already so much shit.
[11:20.96]So you got, by the way, what are we talking about?
[11:23.10]I'm going back in front of the green screen one more time to complete the green screen trilogy.
[11:30.68]Where's the tweet?
[11:31.26]I don't tweet.
[11:32.00]Guys, one day I will tweet out all of my drafts.
[11:35.84]I'm just going to tweet out like five images on Twitter and it's just all going to be all my drafts and you can just laugh at all of them.
[11:40.99]I don't care.
[11:46.15]Do that today.
[11:46.99]No, I'm holding them.
[11:54.79]But anyways.
[11:56.53]Yeah.
[11:57.19]You have another about 48-ish hours to give a suggestion of an action you want to see me do in front of the green screen.
[12:03.10]I will be getting in front of the green screen.
[12:04.94]I have a date.
[12:08.18]I have a date in mind, but I might need to change it, so I'm not going to tell you.
[12:11.44]But it's going to be within the next week and a half.
[12:16.39]Depending on how many props I need to get, I'm going to have to maybe move it to like a week and a half from now.
[12:24.96]So I will be getting in front of the screen within the next 10 to 12 days.
[12:32.71]With all the suggestions.
[12:33.85]And by the way, I got to make this really... We got to go over this because I know this is going to be kind of tricky to kind of deal with this maybe.
[12:42.13]But the last time we did the green screen stream, we had a lot of submissions.
[12:48.00]There were a ton.
[12:49.72]The channel has grown by about three to four hundred percent since that stream.
[12:56.01]And... It's... I'm imagining there might be potentially thousands of submissions to this.
[13:04.36]So, if you submit something, even if it's good, it's gonna be so hard for us to vet out a ton of videos.
[13:12.98]We're gonna have to pick... We're gonna have to narrow it down by a lot.
[13:17.76]So, if there are... If there are like 5,000 video submissions, it'll be physically impossible to watch them.
[13:26.20]So what's going to happen is we're going to be narrowing this down to maybe only six to seven hours worth of content.
[13:32.86]Maybe 12 hours to be able to do it a couple of nights, have an encore night.
[13:37.58]So if you submit something, it's not guaranteed to be put in.
[13:41.94]Any action you say is just not, just put it out there and hope for the best because it's going to be really difficult to narrow down like three, four, 5,000 video submissions or even submissions in general.
[13:56.16]Only six to seven hours.
[13:57.70]That's a lot.
[14:00.46]And if you were there last time, we do get to a point where there's sort of... After like three or four streams worth of green screen stuff, you can kind of hit... Infomercial exhaustion.
[14:12.91]Do you remember that?
[14:14.85]I don't want to get to a point where we're just kind of blinking our eyes, sitting there going, Jeez.
[14:19.92]Okay, I guess here comes another one.
[14:21.42]Here comes another one.
[14:24.88]You can get green screen exhaustion.
[14:26.35]It's a thing.
[14:28.85]So, I'm looking for like 10 to 12 hours of footage to show over the course of two or three streams.
[14:35.97]I ain't showing 10,000... I'm not showing 10,000 green screen videos.
[14:40.17]It's not fucking happening, alright?
[14:43.29]But, that will be happening in June here.
[14:45.82]That's like the thing that we're gonna do in June.
[14:51.29]I'm going to get in front of the screen.
[14:53.16]You'll have, I want to say, maybe two weeks to put something together.
[14:57.90]And then somewhere in the, I want to say, third or fourth week of June, we're going to do, we'll do the night.
[15:04.65]It should be fun.
[15:05.89]Hard dates will come out in the next three or four days, I would assume.
[15:10.32]It's an assignment.
[15:11.78]Yeah.
[15:13.15]Alright, so that's that announcement.
[15:14.25]There you go.
[15:14.69]That's green screen somewhere in the middle of June.
[15:17.01]I'm getting in front of it.
[15:18.55]And then in the end of June, we're going to watch the videos, and it's going to be fucking PogChamp, and I want to see PogChamps in chat.
[15:23.98]Giving us homework.
[15:24.76]That's right!
[15:26.46]Do this IRL?
[15:27.38]Yeah!
[15:27.96]I did it.
[15:29.36]Okay, second thing.
[15:31.74]Announcement two of four.
[15:36.49]Grotto Beasts.
[15:38.96]Ladies and gentlemen, Grotto Beasts is, I would say, the train is kind of pulling into the station.
[15:48.70]This still needs a little bit more time.
[15:50.94]It looks insane.
[15:53.90]I haven't really talked that much about it because it's fucking ridiculous.
[15:58.04]Let's just put it that way.
[15:59.92]It's going to be probably ready for, I hope we can figure out some, you know, whatever the fulfillment that we're going to be using.
[16:08.69]The idea is that this will be something that we can get off the ground by the fall of this year.
[16:16.49]Like that's, I said March, I said February, March last year, and it was just not even close to being a realistic thing to do.
[16:24.36]So we're hoping that somewhere in fall, it'll be actually, we'll be able to get it, have it on your desk.
[16:28.99]And there it is, Grotto Beasts.
[16:30.82]They are going to be the Grotto Beasts team.
[16:35.09]We'll start being more active on Twitter.
[16:38.07]So go follow the Grotto Beasts Twitter.
[16:40.11]Can we get some of the mods to put that?
[16:41.33]It's not NFTs.
[16:42.27]What are you talking about?
[16:43.61]No.
[16:43.85]What?
[16:44.45]Why?
[16:45.07]How many times do I have to say this?
[16:46.93]It's not NFTs.
[16:50.80]It's physical.
[16:51.72]You're going to have the card in your hand.
[16:53.14]It's a physical card game.
[16:54.92]It's not NFT.
[16:55.56]What are you talking about?
[17:00.07]It's alright.
[17:01.05]So when people were talking about Grotto Beasts like six months ago, and it's like, I've got this thing, Grotto Beasts.
[17:05.69]Jerma, is it NFTs?
[17:07.41]No.
[17:08.17]Okay, good.
[17:09.65]Another two months go by.
[17:10.65]Hey, yeah, Grotto Beasts is coming along.
[17:12.03]It's Jerma.
[17:12.31]It's not NFTs, is it?
[17:14.33]No.
[17:15.42]No, it's not.
[17:15.98]No.
[17:16.98]Okay, good.
[17:17.60]Good.
[17:17.76]Just making sure.
[17:21.12]Hey, Jerma.
[17:22.80]Are they NFTs?
[17:27.56]No, they're not NFTs.
[17:30.52]Okay.
[17:31.02]Sorry.
[17:31.18]I just had to scream into my shirt there.
[17:36.96]No, they're not NFTs.
[17:37.90]It's a physical card game.
[17:40.47]It's a physical card game.
[17:41.39]There's nothing to do with NFTs.
[17:47.35]Understandable.
[17:48.09]Yeah.
[17:50.40]MonkaW, calm down.
[17:53.98]Oh, that's worse noise.
[17:59.90]That was... That was... No, you can't have another scoop of ice cream, baby.
[18:05.18]Why not?
[18:05.76]Tantrum.
[18:11.45]Toddler.
[18:14.07]That was loud as fuck.
[18:15.49]Was it?
[18:20.30]I can't... Whatever.
[18:25.74]Alright, no, they're not NFTs.
[18:27.78]It's a physical card collection.
[18:30.86]You're just going to buy it, and you can have it, and there it is.
[18:35.27]That's it.
[18:36.01]But trains coming into the station, you should keep on the lookout for... Follow the Guard of East Twitter.
[18:44.48]Follow me on Twitter.
[18:45.38]You know, I might have something to say about it.
[18:47.96]But yeah, that project is going to be coming to a close, and I'm really excited about it.
[18:50.75]It should be really cool.
[18:52.45]Might have a stream that is kind of based around that project.
[18:58.56]No details for you now, but just know that it probably will happen.
[19:02.65]Okay, announcement three of four.
[19:05.05]You already know this one, but baseball is pretty much locked in, ready to go.
[19:08.73]I'm incredibly excited for it.
[19:10.57]It's going to be like the most fun I've had on camera, and I keep saying that every event stream that I do, but I'm willing to give you a few details.
[19:19.70]So this is the Jerma Baseball Association.
[19:22.48]It's going to be an exhibition game between the Cincinnati Clowns and the Maryland Magicians.
[19:30.49]That's all you really need to know.
[19:31.59]But just... I mean, it's going to be in the middle of the... They're currently going to be in the middle of their season, so... Should be an interesting, interesting time.
[19:42.12]That's July 14th.
[19:44.56]Mark it on your calendar if you have to.
[19:53.35]Can we bet?
[19:56.21]No, I mean, it's just an exhibition game, man.
[20:03.06]Let us gamble on the... No.
[20:05.96]Well, maybe.
[20:06.40]I don't know.
[20:11.00]So that's a yes.
[20:11.74]No, I don't want you betting on the game.
[20:15.54]But yeah, that is the stream.
[20:18.52]I'm very excited about it.
[20:20.63]I've been waiting to do this stream for two years.
[20:23.81]If you've been following the channel for a long time, you know that that project has hit multiple COVID snags.
[20:31.26]Two years ago when I wanted to do it, we physically couldn't because of COVID.
[20:35.73]And then a year later, we still had issues with can we do this because the whole idea with that stream, remember, is that there's going to be
[20:48.23]It's not just going to be like a couple of people hanging out and playing a game.
[20:52.34]It's two baseball teams.
[20:55.94]There's going to be like 30 fucking people there.
[20:58.52]So that's a lot of people.
[21:01.53]And it had to keep getting postponed and postponed and postponed two years ago because of COVID.
[21:08.14]But I'm incredibly excited for that stream.
[21:09.64]I can't wait.
[21:10.42]It's going to be so much fun.
[21:11.52]And you'll see why I feel that way.
[21:14.24]And I'll be hyping it up, because I don't want people to not know that that's happening, right?
[21:18.36]July 14th, I'll get a time for you.
[21:20.81]We're probably shooting for the afternoon.
[21:23.85]But, yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[21:26.43]The fourth thing that I'm really excited about... Why is it city versus a state?
[21:33.06]Well, let me tell you about just pulling random fucking city and state names out of a hat to come up with names for these teams.
[21:42.45]Because that's what pretty much I was doing.
[21:44.11]I was just like, okay, I guess that's what it is.
[21:46.31]City versus state.
[21:51.97]That's actually really funny.
[21:56.14]Cincinnati versus Maryland.
[22:00.34]Yeah, but that's... No, that's bullshit.
[22:01.74]Okay, what about the New England Patriots?
[22:05.10]That's literally just a general area of the world.
[22:09.38]New England Patriots?
[22:14.54]The Florida Marlins?
[22:16.73]Yeah.
[22:17.53]What are you talking about?
[22:18.35]They do that already.
[22:22.77]Yeah, I'm fine.
[22:23.89]Everything's fine.
[22:24.63]Don't worry about it.
[22:28.96]Yeah, there's tons of... Yeah, come on.
[22:31.04]Come on, Gwen.
[22:31.56]Give me a break.
[22:37.32]They're the Miami Marlins.
[22:39.72]I don't care.
[22:47.29]I wasn't sitting here when I was coming up with the team names going... Hold on a minute.
[22:53.39]Oh, yes.
[22:55.19]No, I was just like, what?
[22:56.87]I need a name for the clowns.
[22:59.25]I don't care.
[23:02.89]But that makes it funnier.
[23:03.91]I don't care.
[23:04.31]It's funny.
[23:05.57]And death.
[23:08.84]There may have been graphics that have already been made.
[23:11.26]So, who cares?
[23:17.96]But anyways,
[23:21.21]Ladies and gentlemen, the last announcement I'm going to make for you today is the announcement of an announcement.
[23:26.79]Yeah, I love doing those.
[23:29.11]There's another huge project that's going to be probably somewhere between August and October.
[23:34.98]It's going to be massive.
[23:37.70]Currently, I've spent the last maybe four or five days reaching out to certain people, getting interest, gauging people's opinions on things, but there's going to be
[23:48.37]a major project that's going to happen between August and October.
[23:56.29]I want this summer to be nuts.
[23:57.33]You know what I mean?
[24:00.02]Is it like Dollhouse level?
[24:01.64]Yes.
[24:04.02]It's not Dollhouse 2.
[24:06.92]I don't do sequels.
[24:10.70]I don't do sequels.
[24:18.09]It's a prequel, though.
[24:21.39]Green Screen 3.
[24:23.88]But that's different, though.
[24:25.36]Alright, fine.
[24:26.10]I do trilogies.
[24:27.48]I do trilogies.
[24:28.12]I don't do sequels.
[24:28.82]There you go.
[24:30.22]So Dollhouse was never supposed to be a trilogy.
[24:32.23]Green Screen was supposed to be a trilogy.
[24:33.69]So that's different.
[24:38.43]But yeah, I'm so excited about this.
[24:40.57]I will tell you.
[24:42.71]It's so hard to tell anything because if it has to change for some reason or it doesn't work out.
[24:48.48]But just here you go.
[24:49.76]Here's all I'm going to tell you.
[24:50.90]But just be ready.
[24:51.50]That stream is going to happen somewhere between August and October.
[24:53.36]There's a character on the stream that a lot of people like.
[24:59.92]I'm sure you will see them again.
[25:02.61]For something.
[25:04.39]Whatever that is.
[25:05.73]Who knows?
[25:06.73]Whatever that could be.
[25:09.87]There is going to be a stream.
[25:12.95]I'm hoping that we can get it together.
[25:16.95]I don't know.
[25:18.75]Who knows?
[25:19.23]There you go.
[25:19.75]There's your little... Thanks for the announcement, dude.
[25:22.61]You literally just said, Hey, project.
[25:24.65]Big project.
[25:25.41]August.
[25:26.25]Bye.
[25:27.91]I know.
[25:29.51]But I'm just so excited for it.
[25:32.77]The last, like, three or four days, I've just been, like, fucking, just, like, writer Andy.
[25:36.19]Just, like, writing a fucking novel about these things.
[25:38.93]So... In due time, you will know.
[25:44.13]But I'm very excited for it.
[25:45.20]But I'm really hoping that... It's gonna be by August.
[25:48.90]I mean, by October.
[25:50.36]Without a doubt.
[25:50.90]Because there's no... I can't do it after October.
[25:53.48]It's no way.
[25:57.90]So there you go.
[25:59.72]There's your, like, let's catch up because you've been gone for, like, five days.
[26:09.18]Alright, I'm going to squelch some rumors here.
[26:13.17]It is not Catboy related.
[26:15.55]Sorry, I'm going to have to squelch some rumors.
[26:16.87]I'm seeing some rumors in the chat.
[26:20.15]It is not Catboy related.
[26:25.35]Squelch?
[26:27.48]Yeah, it's like an old World of Warcraft term where you muted somebody.
[26:40.99]How do you guys not know that?
[26:46.23]Is it a Ratboy stream?
[26:47.61]No, it's not any time... Alright, we gotta go.
[26:51.74]I gotta stream.
[26:55.19]I gotta go.
[26:56.25]No, I gotta go.
[26:56.99]Stay.
[26:57.27]I haven't even started.
[26:58.05]Alright, let's go.
[27:00.35]But TL;DR... Holy shit, I'm excited for the summer.
[27:05.71]After the summer?
[27:06.76]Wow.
[27:08.52]The summer should be full of fun stuff.
[27:10.26]I'm very excited.
[27:12.06]Let's go.
[27:12.96]Let's play ULTRAKILL.
[27:16.92]Should be able to see me now.
[27:17.86]Can you see me?
[27:18.86]Can you guys see me?
[27:21.14]You can't see anything.
[27:22.56]Well, oops.
[27:24.44]Can you see?
[27:24.82]There you go.
[27:25.90]You can see that now, can't you?
[27:28.34]Now, what about me?
[27:29.08]Can you see?
[27:29.64]What about me?
[27:30.20]Can you see me?
[27:31.32]What about me?
[27:31.90]Can you see me now?
[27:33.04]There you go.
[27:33.88]How are you?
[27:34.66]Hi.
[27:36.90]So, ULTRAKILL is a first-person shooter game.
[27:39.54]Are you going to squelch me?
[27:45.43]Alright, that's fine.
[27:46.13]I don't care.
[27:51.29]Alright, so, ULTRAKILL.
[27:52.87]I don't know anything about it.
[27:53.64]I know it's a video game.
[27:54.50]It came out two years ago.
[27:55.92]Oh, well.
[27:56.24]Okay, is that a problem?
[27:58.96]Jeremy, this game came out two years ago.
[28:01.74]I play games that came out ten years ago all the time on this channel.
[28:08.58]It's still in development.
[28:10.58]Is it too loud?
[28:12.46]Should I put both headphones in?
[28:13.82]This is a gamer game, right?
[28:18.33]This is from the very beginning.
[28:19.37]I've never played this.
[28:20.97]This is a gamer game, isn't it?
[28:23.83]Alright, if it's a gamer game, I think I can handle it.
[28:30.58]How did the Three Stooges used to do that?
[28:33.32]It was like... I don't know.
[28:44.11]They were fucking professionals.
[28:45.47]Alright, keep out.
[28:46.77]Mouse 5 to punch.
[28:53.40]This is really fucking loud.
[28:54.58]I gotta turn it down.
[28:56.72]Like, it's too loud for me.
[28:57.56]Like, way too loud.
[29:04.25]Okay.
[29:04.91]Now, is it too loud for you?
[29:05.81]What do you guys think?
[29:09.91]How do you have five buttons on your mouse?
[29:11.63]I don't.
[29:11.97]I have three.
[29:12.45]I don't know why it's called mouse five.
[29:13.89]It's weird.
[29:14.29]Okay.
[29:15.53]Okay.
[29:19.18]So that's punch.
[29:20.42]Left control is slide.
[29:21.42]That didn't work.
[29:23.04]Oh, I have to hold it.
[29:23.64]Okay.
[29:26.24]Shift to dash consumes stamina.
[29:28.92]And you can dash in the air.
[29:29.90]And then you can double jump too.
[29:31.96]Okay.
[29:36.20]Alright, so now do I have a gun?
[29:38.72]Deal close range damage to douse yourself in fresh blood.
[29:41.68]This is the only way to regain health.
[29:53.04]I know people are going to make a comment on it, so I'm just going to show you.
[29:55.96]I'm drinking this today.
[29:57.44]I know people are going to say it's like fucking sewer water.
[30:00.24]But look, here you go.
[30:01.74]Get it out of your system.
[30:05.33]Okay, I literally just took a sip out of it.
[30:07.47]I took a sip out of the sewer water.
[30:08.91]So you can laugh about it.
[30:15.24]Okay, jump while near a wall to wall jump.
[30:19.81]Okay.
[30:20.79]Control in the air to ground slam?
[30:22.77]Okay, there's a lot of things you can do.
[30:29.54]Jesus, this is still loud somehow.
[30:32.26]Most levels have secret soul orbs.
[30:33.94]Touch them to get point bonus.
[30:36.80]Ow!
[30:36.96]Is that it?
[30:48.78]Alright, where does the Gogeta Gogeta start?
[30:53.39]When does it start?
[30:54.79]I know it's gonna start.
[30:57.49]When does the Gogeta Gogeta start?
[31:05.96]Come on.
[31:08.96]New Blood presents.
[31:11.64]Come on, where's the Gogeta?
[31:12.52]Come on.
[31:14.98]Come on.
[31:18.89]A game by Arcee Hakita.
[31:26.54]Where is it?
[31:27.44]Here it comes!
[31:30.16]Ooh!
[31:54.98]Alright.
[32:01.48]So this thing looks chaotic.
[32:03.92]So wait, do I have to... Okay, well, this thing charges.
[32:06.72]Do I have to... Is there a reload or no?
[32:12.37]Get the fuck out of here.
[32:23.09]Turn the music up.
[32:31.75]But I don't like music.
[32:36.61]Like that?
[32:41.96]I'm gonna turn the sensitivity up just a little bit.
[32:43.84]I put it way too down.
[32:46.78]Where is it?
[32:47.16]Okay.
[32:47.68]Maybe like 15?
[32:48.62]Feels a little better.
[32:53.76]Hold right button to charge.
[32:54.98]Oh, that's how I did it.
[32:57.40]And then do I let it go?
[33:02.42]The music's good.
[33:03.10]I know, but I just don't... I'm a fucking weirdo, alright?
[33:06.26]I don't really listen to that much music.
[33:11.31]Alright, that's fucking sick.
[33:18.35]How am I getting a C?
[33:19.11]I should be getting more than that.
[33:31.99]Oh, shit.
[33:32.27]Alright, sensitivities.
[33:41.02]Sensitivities too high.
[33:43.82]12.
[33:48.02]C for cool.
[33:48.82]Good control.
[33:52.51]Alright, that feels good.
[34:27.07]Come on, that's a B!
[34:27.73]That's an A!
[34:33.14]This dude's Morbin right now.
[34:37.32]I don't even know what that means.
[34:39.68]Punch to deflect?
[34:42.20]I didn't get it.
[34:42.66]I don't get it.
[34:46.51]What's going on?
[34:48.81]Okay, that's very specific.
[34:50.23]Alright, I'm just gonna do the Bloodborne technique and that's just dodge everything and don't ever parry.
[35:03.04]This is chaotic?
[35:03.82]Yeah, it is.
[35:11.76]It's fun though.
[35:12.42]This is really fun.
[35:18.72]Any secrets?
[35:27.14]Oh shit, I'm sliding.
[35:28.28]That's pretty fun.
[35:35.60]Nice.
[35:35.94]Oh!
[35:38.30]You're so glad I'm playing this?
[35:39.36]I mean, it looks fun.
[35:43.01]Ground slam deals damage on direct hits.
[35:45.19]Where'd they go?
[35:51.81]Whoa!
[35:54.69]Oh, you can launch them in the air!
[35:56.73]Oh, you can launch them in the air!
[35:59.10]Why did my Boston just come out?
[36:06.66]Oops!
[36:07.50]I died.
[36:10.90]What happens?
[36:12.21]Do I get to keep going?
[36:50.96]I'm literally hitting it with my hand.
[37:11.90]Nice.
[37:16.90]Got it.
[37:22.20]Boss?
[37:24.51]My hands are like, oh, sweaty.
[37:56.74]Why am I having a vampire?
[37:58.06]I'm waking up.
[38:05.14]I'm within.
[38:21.49]Offbeat.
[38:23.21]No, I'm not going to do it.
[38:34.64]Alright, how do I go?
[38:35.32]What did this crash?
[38:45.78]No, it didn't.
[38:46.17]I'm an idiot.
[38:49.09]You know one song.
[38:54.59]Tip of the day.
[38:56.45]Hit-scan weapons like the revolver do locational damage.
[38:59.89]A headshot deals two times damage and a limb shot deals 1.5 damage.
[39:05.53]Cool.
[39:06.93]Weapons.
[39:07.35]Revolver.
[39:08.71]Oh.
[39:14.76]What?
[39:19.20]Really?
[39:19.48]Whoa.
[39:22.34]This is cool.
[39:23.24]Can I upgrade this?
[39:25.74]Okay, so let me see.
[39:28.68]Cycle through equipped variations with E. So what is this?
[39:33.45]This is a...
[39:36.91]Okay, so if I throw the coin in the air, bing, boom, it'll bing, boom, and it'll hit somebody's weak point?
[39:44.66]Okay.
[39:45.16]What about actual just kind of damage and shit?
[39:49.60]Are these the same exact weapon with the only difference being the right click?
[39:54.94]They're the same?
[39:57.75]Okay.
[39:59.53]Alright.
[40:01.61]That's cool.
[40:01.91]What about the other stuff?
[40:04.65]Enemies.
[40:08.07]The cyber grind.
[40:09.09]I don't want to do that yet.
[40:14.54]Sandbox.
[40:17.52]Okay.
[40:18.84]So do I just go?
[40:21.06]What do I do?
[40:21.96]Can I just go?
[40:22.34]Let's go.
[40:35.99]That's fucking cool.
[40:37.29]That was... That's really cool.
[40:53.87]I got an S on this one.
[40:59.03]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[41:19.72]Ooh, double S. That's double S. I didn't lie.
[41:53.53]Sorry.
[41:54.59]That was probably really loud.
[41:55.49]I'm sorry.
[42:08.21]That was not so loud.
[42:09.09]I'm sorry.
[42:10.96]I gotta, like, go like this.
[42:12.26]Like, ugh!
[42:18.10]I'm alright.
[42:29.73]What is this?
[42:37.97]Was I already in here?
[42:58.74]I don't get it.
[42:59.08]I don't get it.
[43:01.24]It's for a secret level.
[43:07.56]I gotta turn this down, man.
[43:08.84]I can't fucking hear.
[43:09.50]I'm sorry.
[43:15.24]It's good.
[43:15.62]I have to find something and put it here.
[43:21.00]Alright, whatever.
[43:25.15]Find something and put it here, Andy.
[43:26.73]Right?
[43:26.87]Okay.
[43:27.01]Okay.
[43:35.40]Who's this?
[43:55.83]Ultra.
[43:56.73]Ultra.
[43:57.55]Ultra.
[44:03.60]Oh, I got it.
[44:08.24]Why are you speaking like an AI today?
[44:10.20]How am I speaking like an AI?
[44:29.12]Under construction, okay.
[44:31.84]Should I just keep going?
[44:34.03]New camera angle means fake Jerma.
[44:37.58]Oh, it's the camera angle, I see.
[44:38.86]Ah, alright, I see.
[44:39.94]People are concerned about the camera.
[44:43.32]How come I'm eating something?
[44:44.30]I'm not.
[44:44.68]I'm drinking fucking sludge that I got from the sewer.
[44:46.96]Look.
[44:48.52]This is sludge water.
[44:50.14]I'm drinking sludge water, okay?
[45:01.09]I kind of like this better, but we'll see.
[45:14.06]This game's fun as hell.
[45:15.80]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[45:16.65]Oh.
[45:32.31]Nope.
[45:50.40]Wait.
[45:52.65]Can I get up there?
[45:59.80]Ah!
[46:03.58]Okay.
[46:04.98]Ooh.
[46:05.54]So what does this do?
[46:06.78]I get bonus points?
[46:09.95]I don't know what that does, but cool.
[46:10.95]I got it.
[46:20.00]Boss door.
[46:20.64]Wait, don't go in the boss door yet.
[46:21.64]It's probably other stuff.
[46:24.64]Go up.
[46:29.47]Is there a shotgun in this game?
[46:36.81]Insufficient firepower.
[46:38.11]What?
[46:42.32]Bullshit.
[46:43.56]Bullshit.
[46:49.22]Is there fall damage?
[46:56.09]You can throw multiple coins at once.
[47:00.64]Do they both shoot out?
[47:03.02]Wait, what?
[47:07.18]Turn up the volume.
[47:12.18]Got you.
[47:12.60]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[47:13.91]Wait, what's this?
[47:14.49]Oh, it wants to know if I want to change weapons for the boss?
[47:20.23]Nah, I got this.
[47:35.11]Holy shit, that was... Whoa!
[48:09.80]What's going on?
[48:16.65]Shotgun?
[48:24.39]The blood heals you.
[48:25.37]Oh, that's right.
[48:26.07]Alright, well, I don't want to go that way yet, because I want to go back up.
[48:32.29]This is going to be my favorite.
[48:40.46]Should I blow these up?
[48:43.43]Can I get points or money or anything from those or no?
[48:50.85]Punch the shotgun bullets.
[48:53.29]What?
[48:59.61]Are you serious?
[49:02.91]What are you talking about?
[49:15.84]Ooh, that's fucking loud, but it's good.
[49:25.82]Shotgun's the best item in the game.
[49:41.37]Supreme.
[49:43.49]Anarchic.
[49:47.08]Brutal.
[49:48.46]Anarchic.
[49:49.62]Brutal.
[49:56.38]Chaotic.
[49:57.90]Destructive.
[50:14.12]How do I take a new weapon?
[50:17.21]Announcer Andy.
[50:33.28]League of Legends announcer pack.
[50:35.92]Oh, don't go over there.
[50:43.88]Brutal.
[50:49.58]I need to get over S, S. This is probably a secret.
[51:07.96]I wasn't even fucking close, dude.
[51:10.50]What are you talking about?
[51:11.28]I wasn't even close.
[51:14.74]You're sadistic.
[51:16.76]That was probably loud, I'm sorry.
[51:21.05]I can't do it.
[51:23.01]It's going to be loud.
[51:23.99]It's going to be too loud.
[51:24.93]I can't do it.
[51:27.65]It's going to be way too fucking loud.
[51:28.87]I can't do it.
[51:29.23]It's going to be too loud.
[51:30.25]I was going to scream ultra.
[51:32.87]But I don't have a compressor on this mic, so it's going to be fucking horrible to listen to.
[51:39.97]Oh, yeah.
[51:46.75]Anarchic.
[51:49.16]Supreme!
[51:51.35]Oh, I'm ready to say a shitstorm.
[52:11.67]Come on, play better at the game.
[52:12.95]I want to say it.
[52:15.15]I want to say it so bad.
[52:17.39]You have no idea how badly I want to say it.
[52:20.66]Brutal, not good enough.
[52:21.76]Come on, you piece of shit.
[52:22.96]Hurry up.
[52:24.06]Brutal, no.
[52:29.76]No, just chaotic.
[52:31.62]It's okay.
[53:43.86]Come on come on you can do it.
[53:44.92]I know you I got Fuck
[54:04.00]Sabrewolf!
[54:14.99]You can flip other weapons?
[54:16.01]What?
[54:20.99]Play on a higher difficulty?
[54:22.05]I'm on normal.
[54:23.45]Is normal too easy?
[54:26.28]That didn't feel easy.
[54:27.18]Okay.
[54:34.78]I have money, right?
[54:37.40]Revolver, shotgun.
[55:01.43]What does that do?
[55:08.91]That was weird.
[55:11.67]You can do that four times.
[55:14.99]Three times.
[55:16.87]Alright, so, but it just kills you.
[55:29.10]I can't, it can't do it four times.
[55:33.80]Three times is too much.
[55:36.20]What if I jump?
[55:37.94]No.
[55:39.96]You can't do it four times.
[55:41.28]It's one, two, boom.
[55:43.38]One, two, boom.
[55:44.78]Alright.
[55:45.28]I can handle that.
[55:46.36]I can handle that.
[55:46.96]Switch weapon before it explodes.
[55:51.72]I don't know if I can... It could be like a rocket jump.
[55:56.28]I'll try it.
[55:59.03]I like... One, two, dee.
[56:00.79]One, two, dee.
[56:06.74]We'll try.
[56:07.08]This is gonna start to get confusing.
[56:10.80]Time it with the... Alright, I don't do those advanced... I play on normal.
[56:20.41]I don't do advanced techniques.
[57:02.45]New enemy.
[57:03.35]New enemy type.
[57:13.46]What the fuck?
[57:15.16]Why did it bounce?
[57:27.39]Fucking die!
[57:29.55]Die!
[57:35.05]That thing was ridiculous.
[57:41.17]That first boss is now a regular enemy.
[57:46.97]Sadistic.
[58:04.50]Okay.
[58:06.23]Wait.
[58:13.16]What's up here?
[58:14.64]Found a secret!
[58:19.14]What's the red?
[58:23.03]Holy fucking shit.
[58:24.09]What?
[58:27.19]What the fuck?
[58:28.65]Huh?
[58:35.84]No way!
[58:54.57]What is hitting me?
[58:59.07]Should I try it again?
[59:10.73]What if I can't do it?
[59:25.82]Oh, that's fucking impossible.
[59:27.14]That's literally not possible.
[59:28.54]That's impossible.
[59:30.99]That's not even, that's not even possible.
[59:33.21]That's physically not possible encounter.
[59:53.75]You're an old lady.
[59:54.45]I'm not an old lady.
[59:55.09]I'll prove it.
[60:04.14]I don't think I can fucking do it.
[60:41.91]I'm gonna head to bed.
[60:42.65]Can you wish me a good night?
[60:43.60]Have a... Ah, good night.
[60:50.61]Whatever that was.
[60:51.27]Who was it?
[61:28.53]No!
[61:33.61]What the fuck is this bullshit?
[61:37.96]What is this bullshit?
[61:41.48]Okay, I did it.
[61:42.34]I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.
[61:48.05]Red soul orbs give 200 health.
[61:49.71]Overheal cannot be regained with blood.
[61:51.41]It's just an overheal?
[61:54.88]It's just an overheal, that's it?
[61:59.06]You're scary today.
[62:06.10]I'm not.
[62:06.52]I'm fine.
[62:07.78]Don't scream into the mic.
[62:10.08]I'm trying not to.
[62:11.08]I promise I'm not trying to be loud.
[62:15.34]Is it loud?
[62:15.84]What should I do about it?
[62:19.59]I'm trying to, like, just not scream.
[62:23.23]Is it fine?
[62:26.77]Is it be- Alright, can I go up here?
[62:35.80]Why can I go- Can I do any- No.
[62:39.66]You're fine?
[62:40.28]It was one guy?
[62:41.12]Okay.
[62:52.03]I missed.
[62:57.49]What?
[62:58.73]What the fuck?
[63:00.85]Oh, the glass is... Alright, I gotta stay up here.
[63:34.66]I

[64:05.39]Ultra!
[64:06.31]Ultra!
[64:18.82]Cool, alright.
[64:19.38]I got it.
[64:24.16]I think that's it, right?
[64:24.86]Did I get it?
[64:27.78]Please do a funny scream.
[64:28.78]I'm not- I don't wanna scream into the mic.
[64:29.88]It's gonna hurt somebody's fucking ears.
[64:44.23]Okay.
[64:50.05]Dermot, it hurt my ears every time you say fuck.
[64:56.20]Does it?
[64:58.42]You look like a chicken.
[64:59.22]What are you gonna do with that one, fucking internet?
[65:14.52]Deal with that one.
[65:26.77]Alright, I can't buy anything else?
[65:37.45]He's high.
[65:38.49]I'm not.
[65:40.73]I'm literally not.
[65:44.43]Cerberus.
[65:48.70]How long is the game?
[65:56.26]What's wrong with him today?
[65:58.62]Nothing's wrong with me today that's any different than... Guys, the chicken noise was nominated for like worst sound of the year in like 2019.
[66:04.44]I feel like I haven't done that before.
[66:16.00]Can I stand on this?
[66:17.10]Okay, for a second I can.
[66:24.71]Alright, so I like the... I like this.
[66:27.21]This is so loud.
[66:33.89]I like the coin.
[66:36.22]It's hard to hit, but it's fun.
[66:37.14]So I'm going to do coin, and I like these.
[66:47.42]I wanted full health.
[66:49.36]Alright, you guys ready?
[66:50.63]Let's go.
[66:56.45]Oh, I can't keep them on the green.
[66:59.07]I have to swap it.
[67:00.67]I can't leave it on the green?
[67:03.97]Okay, it's Q. Cool.
[67:12.76]You can do that in the settings?
[67:13.62]Q works.
[67:17.68]Although, if I get sick of Q, I can do a mouse scroll, I'm assuming.
[67:30.85]Oops.
[67:31.09]Sure didn't miss anything.
[67:44.44]That's a death?
[67:46.72]That just looks like a little spinning log.
[67:48.16]That wouldn't kill you.
[67:49.42]Why would that kill you?
[67:50.16]That doesn't hurt.
[67:51.06]How would that kill you?
[67:54.86]That was just a spinning log.
[68:05.51]Why?
[68:05.75]How does this kill you?
[68:06.43]Alright, I gotta...
[68:19.68]A boss already?
[68:20.54]Attack sound cues allow you to keep track of enemies off screen.
[68:28.15]This is a boss already.
[68:35.56]Cyber grind.
[68:37.06]Not yet.
[68:38.66]Abandon hope all who enter here.
[68:49.84]Oh shit, it's these things.
[68:53.84]Is it both or just one?
[68:57.16]Oh god damn it.
[69:11.69]Fuck!
[69:13.33]Alright, I gotta get the timings down.
[69:24.22]I need blood.
[69:35.21]Damn it!
[69:42.03]The AoE hurts.
[69:45.30]Alright, I'm gonna swap to this.
[69:47.86]Let's go... You know what?
[69:48.82]Let's go like this.
[69:49.68]I got an idea.
[69:58.47]How did I kill this thing instantly before?
[70:00.89]I killed it instantly!
[70:01.99]How?
[70:02.25]I don't understand.
[71:19.56]Fuck you!
[72:04.20]Why am I crying?
[72:30.53]Holy shit, that was crazy.
[72:33.62]Jesus.
[72:42.89]You need to put a shawl on, you old lady.
[72:48.05]Use the slide.
[72:49.07]I keep using shift instead of control.
[72:50.84]I keep going like... Like this.
[72:55.70]But this is actually the dash, but it lasts way longer and covers way more surface area, right?
[73:01.72]I keep trying to... I frame dodge.
[73:04.69]This is fun.
[73:06.49]I like it.
[73:08.51]Why is chat being so mean today?
[73:09.93]Oh, because I haven't been around for five days.
[73:11.83]So, you know, they've boiled up like five days worth of insults.
[73:20.27]Wait, anything else I missed?
[73:26.55]I don't think so.
[73:29.82]It was actually six days.
[73:33.29]Thanks for keeping track.
[73:35.75]But I actually hate you.
[73:39.71]I just mean, try to find something you like.
[73:41.76]You enjoy it.
[73:42.22]It makes you happy, man.
[73:46.82]Find something that you like.
[73:48.90]Don't watch me because you hate me.
[73:50.32]Don't hate me.
[73:51.54]Find something you enjoy doing, you know?
[73:57.27]Hating you makes me happy.
[74:01.63]Well, I don't know what to tell you.
[74:09.02]Nothing new.
[74:11.98]I'm starting to get the hang of it, though.
[74:13.00]I'm starting to understand.
[74:14.00]I almost want to switch... I almost want to switch control and shift.
[74:22.11]I feel like I would... Because hitting my pinky kind of hurts.
[74:27.49]This is nice.
[74:32.23]I don't know if there's something in there.
[74:47.01]There's a coin in the fountain?
[75:01.60]Where?
[75:07.96]That's very specific.
[75:08.94]Okay.
[75:10.94]I guess we're going down here.
[75:17.44]What?
[75:22.35]Complete the level in under 10 seconds.
[75:23.79]I could do that.
[75:24.75]Just run and do the... Well.
[75:28.05]So now what?
[75:28.57]You found a secret mission.
[75:36.39]What do I do?
[75:37.25]Okay, this is on.
[75:45.73]Oh.
[75:49.81]Okay.
[75:54.18]How's that wrong?
[75:54.72]What do I do?
[75:55.00]Okay.
[76:07.54]What is this?
[76:08.10]Okay.
[76:25.39]Don't touch that one.
[76:42.24]Easy.
[76:44.38]There's way more of these.
[76:45.63]Alright, let's fucking go.
[76:47.07]Let's go.
[76:47.67]ULTRAKILL.
[76:49.73]ULTRAKILL, a.k.a.
[76:51.43]The Witness.
[77:23.67]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[77:33.56]No, I didn't mean to!
[77:35.14]Whatever, I'm not supposed to scream.
[78:29.89]I got it, stop!
[78:52.06]What?
[78:54.68]More of this bullshit?
[79:10.66]Huh?
[79:15.45]I don't get it.
[79:17.93]Oh, I can do that.
[79:19.57]I get it.
[79:19.97]Okay.
[79:20.31]I was going to say, how's that possible?
[79:22.67]Alright.
[79:22.93]Open the door.
[79:25.77]Oh, God.
[79:26.37]There's more?
[79:28.01]Alright.
[79:36.36]I got it.
[79:36.64]We're going to do this quick.
[79:39.89]Is it a tweet from a dev?
[79:46.85]I'll have to look in a minute.
[79:50.58]Alright, wait.
[79:51.54]So red and blue can both touch white, I'm assuming, right?
[80:02.83]What are you talking about?
[80:03.63]Wait, they can't?
[80:12.20]Why?
[80:18.09]What the fuck?
[80:19.57]Huh?
[80:22.87]How old are you?
[80:23.97]You didn't get both red.
[80:27.17]This is a new mechanic.
[80:30.35]Everybody calls me a dumbass.
[80:31.74]It's a brand new mechanic I haven't seen.
[80:34.48]Why would I know this immediately?
[80:38.00]I'm asking a simple question.
[80:39.74]I've gotten this far in five minutes.
[80:42.42]Okay, so... Okay, so I was right.
[81:08.07]Guys, what?
[81:24.68]How would I... How do you do this one?
[81:34.46]Because I can't go either one of these directions, can I?
[81:40.38]I'll come back to that one.
[81:47.40]This is an iPad game?
[81:48.45]I'm fine.
[82:02.72]How would I do this?
[82:06.49]So this, okay, this has to go here.
[82:09.47]This has to go here.
[82:11.73]Okay.
[82:48.51]Thank you.
[83:33.75]How do I get that one?
[83:44.02]How do I get the top left one?
[83:49.72]Blue has to go... Okay, so blue has to go this way.
[83:55.06]But what the fuck?
[83:59.28]How do I do this?
[84:00.87]Blue has...
[84:06.51]No help.
[84:14.17]Like, does that work?
[84:21.22]Yeah, it... Ah, okay.
[84:23.90]I don't know why my brain was saying that the white balls had to be touched by each of the three colors.
[84:30.87]I didn't... Yeah, okay.
[84:31.55]Alright, what was this one again?
[84:33.03]Yeah, this one's weird.
[84:39.08]So now that I got that, that one's easy.
[84:40.78]Alright, now I understand.
[84:41.64]Okay, let's go.
[84:47.67]What?
[84:49.47]Oh.
[84:56.34]What?
[85:00.38]Why is that wrong?
[85:02.92]Oh, fuck.
[85:18.78]Didn't mean it to click that alright one more That was the easiest one
[85:53.86]No, no, wrong.
[86:17.05]Wait, what if this just does that?
[86:19.23]Right?
[86:19.61]I don't have to do any bullshit, right?
[86:26.71]Fuck.
[87:02.73]Shit, it's close. ...
[87:49.64]Got it!
[87:56.51]Testament 2.
[87:57.29]Failure after failure after failure.
[87:59.05]Results.
[88:00.13]Refuse to alter.
[88:01.75]Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and my faith begins to falter.
[88:08.25]Okay.
[88:09.72]Now what?
[88:13.56]That was nice.
[88:14.00]That was actually kind of fun.
[88:14.92]Those puzzles were cool.
[88:18.81]I mean, that's... I liked it.
[88:20.17]That was fun.
[88:22.97]It was called The Witness.
[88:24.13]Oh, The Witless.
[88:25.21]Okay.
[88:25.31]Wait, what happened?
[88:36.44]What does that mean?
[88:37.89]Did I get any points for that?
[88:50.24]Is this a dev tweet?
[88:51.36]Where's the dev tweet?
[89:00.79]From the dev.
[89:02.05]I think more than anything, I'm surprised that Jerma is actually good at the game.
[89:05.09]What?
[89:08.67]Followed by, unprecedented.
[89:10.53]A streamer is good at 1-S puzzles.
[89:17.07]I'm so happy he gets through hard puzzles quick and gets stuck on easy ones.
[89:20.35]It's wonderful.
[89:23.62]I did a fantastic job.
[89:24.92]I think I did a fantastic job.
[89:27.28]I think I did a fantastic job.
[89:35.29]Hey, DM me where the fucking secret weapons are.
[89:42.56]I am good at the game.
[89:43.60]Because I have to prove every so often to all these kids that I am good at video games and I'm not just like an old lady shuffling along.
[89:53.34]No.
[89:56.11]And let me show you right now what I mean by that.
[90:18.48]Explode!
[90:21.61]I'll do it with my eyes closed!
[90:35.90]What?
[90:38.40]What the?
[90:38.68]Whatever.
[90:39.62]Alright, that's a cool weapon.
[90:44.84]How do I use it?
[90:46.22]Wait.
[90:50.30]Use the attractor nail gun's magnets to form concentrated orbs of nails that can be moved around using the pull force of other magnets.
[91:01.35]What are you talking about?
[91:09.38]What do these do?
[91:24.89]Oh, they're magnets!
[91:29.61]I get it.
[91:30.09]So you go like this and then... That's a cool gun.
[91:33.20]I get it.
[91:37.08]So you stick it on somebody and you just... Alright.
[91:44.69]Okay, let's...
[92:02.68]Huh?
[92:07.48]My fingers are slipping off of my mouse.
[92:17.99]Headshot.
[92:20.39]Got it.
[92:22.44]Cool.
[92:22.74]Alright, I need to pull this thing out more.
[92:24.28]Where are they from?
[92:28.12]Okay.
[92:33.92]Is that it?
[92:37.72]Where's the rest?
[92:50.16]Another dev tweet.
[92:55.39]He stuck on the hardest one.
[92:56.83]This has taken some people like 40 minutes to solve.
[92:59.45]Yeah.
[93:00.73]What you don't understand is I came prepared.
[93:03.11]I'm an iPad gamer.
[93:04.95]And what that means is I lie in bed like this.
[93:07.83]You see these?
[93:08.91]Let me show you something.
[93:09.57]This is... Let me show you this.
[93:10.95]Do you see this?
[93:12.53]Do you see my neck?
[93:14.03]The lines on my neck?
[93:17.42]You see I have like line, line, line?
[93:20.81]See?
[93:21.79]Maybe you can't see because of this.
[93:23.63]I have lines on my neck.
[93:25.95]And it's because I go like this.
[93:29.77]You see?
[93:31.21]I lie in bed with an iPad.
[93:34.73]And I'm like this for six hours straight.
[93:40.19]And it gives me these lines here.
[93:41.71]And I play games like that.
[93:45.23]And sometimes I go like this because saliva is coming down.
[93:49.15]But for the most part...
[93:55.08]Dev said your DMs aren't open.
[93:57.12]Yeah, I know.
[93:59.54]No, I don't have my DMs open.
[94:02.56]I would never have my DMs open.
[94:05.80]Do you understand?
[94:06.46]I would wake up every morning and there would be 99 plus sign next to that little thing on Twitter.
[94:15.30]And then just be like, I don't, what the fuck am I going to do about this?
[94:18.10]It would just be, people would send the most ridiculous fucked up shit.
[94:20.60]No way.
[94:25.75]I skipped a level?
[94:26.61]I'll go back.
[94:35.94]So, what do I go from here?
[94:37.30]I can go up there.
[94:39.56]Is this a puzzle?
[94:47.53]What an ego.
[94:49.01]No, I'm... It's not an ego.
[94:50.99]I'm literally telling you real life.
[94:52.53]Like, that's just what happens.
[94:56.11]Are you trying to tell me... Really?
[94:59.11]Really?
[95:00.01]So you're trying to tell me that one of you goofballs in this chat wouldn't be somebody that would just send me 99 plus messages in one day?
[95:11.30]You don't think that would happen?
[95:13.05]You don't think that I would wake up and then one of you would send me 2,000 to 3,000 messages?
[95:18.10]Just to make sure that I would see 99 plus?
[95:21.68]Of course you would.
[95:24.18]That's not ego.
[95:25.28]All it takes is one of you to do that.
[95:27.49]Alright.
[95:28.81]How do I get up there?
[95:32.51]He's goofballed.
[95:42.99]I mean, come on.
[95:44.95]Just don't fall.
[95:45.60]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[95:52.74]There it is.
[95:54.72]And here it is.
[95:56.62]And here you go.
[95:58.62]Don't scream.
[95:59.10]It's gonna be loud and it's gonna hurt somebody's ears.
[96:07.92]Took 40 people... What?
[96:10.42]No, it took... Everybody took 40 minutes to... Whatever the dev said, I don't care.
[96:13.78]40 minutes for people to do that?
[96:32.75]Get off me.
[96:37.71]That's a new enemy, I don't know what it does.
[96:51.40]Holy shit, sadistic.
[97:02.62]What's that?
[97:19.71]bop bop bop bop bop bingo do one of those custom announcer pack things like
[97:37.46]Quadra kill.
[97:40.04]Triple kill.
[97:42.18]Penta kill.
[97:44.10]Wow, that was crazy.
[97:45.36]Where do I go?
[98:00.22]Triple kill.
[98:02.90]I'm going to give you guys a custom announcer pack you can put in, like, I don't know, like, source games.
[98:09.60]Where do I go?
[98:21.33]What?
[98:31.58]Should I put this down here?
[98:33.98]Oh shit, I can't leave.
[98:36.96]Bugleberry?
[98:38.46]After every kill it just goes... That would be every single line.

[101:17.13]But I need to make sure this gets a little bigger.
[101:35.68]Oh, I lost my game capture.
[101:37.22]That's bad.

[102:38.37]Okay, that's regular.
[102:39.31]These are both regular.

[132:02.75]I need health!
[132:08.50]Get out of the fucking way!
[132:09.66]I'm in his body!
[132:10.60]Oh my god!
[132:16.04]I can't... Why did I not get any blood for that?
[132:30.89]Oh my god.
[132:52.14]I feel like I'm fucking way over the thing.
[133:04.36]I'm not- how am I not- how is it not getting blood on me?
[133:08.87]Okay, how am I not getting-
[133:17.83]I honestly feel like I'm looking down at this big explosion and I get hit by it.
[133:22.18]I feel like it happens every...
[134:18.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[134:21.57]How am I supposed to avoid that?
[134:29.00]Oh, that was stupid.
[134:29.94]This is so fucking hard.
[134:34.86]This is so hard.
[134:37.68]This is so hard.
[134:52.24]I hit space!
[134:58.36]Don't be that close!
[135:05.95]Dude, I can't even fucking see, man.
[135:08.27]This is fucking crazy.
[135:13.50]Shut this off.
[135:14.70]You know what, just get this like...
[135:54.46]FUCKING DARE!
[135:55.16]AHH!
[136:18.95]Ha ha...
[136:59.59]That was fucking hard.
[137:00.63]This game's really hard.
[137:01.91]I don't even want to play anymore.
[137:04.35]Okay, that was fun.
[137:18.67]That was fun.
[137:24.98]That was actually really fun.
[137:27.16]You know what I'm saying though?
[137:28.44]I- I need something for my- a desk.
[137:30.20]I need another second desk that's underneath that like goes like and then comes down to the keyboard and I can put it wherever I want.
[137:39.05]It's always the keyboard is under the desk and sometimes that's not in an ideal location.
[137:46.32]Sometimes that's not an ideal location.
[137:48.32]Hold on, sorry.
[137:52.50]How's this- what's still alive?
[138:00.19]Put it on top?
[138:00.79]No, because then you end up like this.
[138:03.49]It's like... It hurts my wrists.
[138:07.67]Only boomers put their keyboards in the desk tray.
[138:10.49]It's not in a desk tray, man.
[138:18.85]It's not in a desk tray.
[138:24.99]We got a new tweet from the dev.
[138:26.97]What does it say?
[138:27.41]Let's find out.
[138:34.20]We have a tweet from the dev?
[138:38.42]What does it say?
[138:46.35]That looks weird.
[138:54.88]Whatever.
[138:57.13]Yeah, it's at HakitaDev.
[139:02.00]Whatever, it's fine.
[139:03.14]Why am I laughing like Butthead?
[139:12.17]That was funny.
[139:16.75]There's only World 1?
[139:17.83]I'm never going to beat this game.
[139:33.38]I know that music.
[139:36.00]Have I heard this music?
[140:03.29]Hey, this one's for you, man.
[140:08.87]Claire DeLune.
[140:11.80]It's alright.
[140:13.26]Bring it on.
[140:17.78]Forgive me.
[140:18.26]Do I have to do anything about this?
[140:27.21]Turn this shit up.
[140:31.17]I don't know.
[140:31.47]There could have been something down here.
[140:33.03]Alright, let's go.
[140:34.47]I need three blue skulls to open that door.
[140:39.11]Let's go.
[140:49.18]Pick up to read.
[140:51.58]Somebody else can read this.
[141:04.45]This one doesn't open?
[141:11.28]Hmm.
[141:21.32]Okay.
[141:34.16]What's that?
[141:35.96]Whatever you are, you're about to get whacked.
[141:39.79]V2.
[142:11.68]Fuck.
[142:43.91]Huh?
[142:45.07]Where'd you go?
[142:45.61]I don't understand.
[142:46.53]Ugh.
[143:58.95]No!
[143:59.63]What are you?
[144:42.01]I went, try jumping.
[144:44.29]I've been in the air 50% of the time.
[144:58.56]Dude, holy shit, man.
[145:00.42]I... Why the... I... What do you want me to do?
[145:03.26]This game's... This game... I'm telling you, this game's fucking hard.
[145:06.56]Why am I a different... I'm in a different language.
[145:08.90]I'm speaking a different language or something, mate.
[145:10.89]I don't know what this is.
[145:12.77]I'm speaking a different fucking language, mate.
[145:49.04]Come on!
[146:25.39]Get closer?
[146:26.11]The guy is flying around the map and dropping missiles everywhere.
[146:32.49]There's no get closer reliability here.
[146:36.65]He's very fast.
[146:39.39]He's very small.
[146:40.88]And I just got point blank and didn't get any blood on me, apparently, so I don't get to win.
[146:45.42]I got a better idea.
[147:21.55]I got it.
[147:21.86]It's got to be this.
[147:22.60]This is the closest I got with this.
[148:17.09]Not too much.
[148:17.99]I get halfway and I'm just like exhausted.
[148:21.28]I get halfway and I get exhausted.
[148:23.06]I get halfway and I get fucking exhausted.
[148:53.44]Come here.
[149:03.48]Where'd he go?
[149:03.82]Where'd he go?
[149:50.36]I was freaking out.
[149:52.60]I was actually freaking out.
[149:59.03]It's just, I get exhausted.
[150:00.59]I can't, my brain goes like, alright, man, that's enough.
[150:02.91]There's no humans are supposed to be doing this.
[150:05.75]You know what fucking humans are supposed to be doing?
[150:08.03]Humans are supposed to be fucking picking up like a wheelbarrow full of like logs and just like slowly walking with it and delivering those logs to the community.
[150:18.19]And then like those logs are used to build houses.
[150:20.48]And then there's also like a baker and like a butcher.
[150:23.00]No humans aren't supposed to be doing what we're doing right now.
[150:26.38]Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.
[150:28.52]Like, we're supposed to be like, oh, howdy, how are you, good to see you.
[150:32.05]We're not supposed to be like, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity.
[150:37.83]No, humans are supposed to be like, we're supposed to be fucking relaxing with each other and having a good time and taking care of the community.
[150:47.49]And...
[150:53.73]It's Amish.
[150:55.01]It's not Amish, man.
[150:57.07]Humans are not supposed to be doing this.
[151:06.06]Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn fucking Declaration of Independence, there was no guggity-guggity in there.
[151:13.26]There was no, oh yeah, we also need to make sure to leave some room for guggity-guggity-guggity-guggity-guggity.
[151:19.04]There's no room for that, Ben.
[151:20.58]What?
[151:35.47]Oatsguy?
[151:36.47]What are you talking about?
[151:38.21]What do you mean?
[151:38.69]What are you talking about?
[151:40.11]Why are you saying Quaker Oatsguy?
[151:42.15]What do you mean the Quaker Oatsguy?
[151:43.62]I don't know what that reference is referencing.
[151:45.76]What are you referencing?
[151:47.64]I don't know what you're talking about.
[151:50.76]No, there was no time for Guggada Guggada.
[151:54.08]I just beat it.
[151:54.73]I just beat it.
[152:06.99]Oh, alright.
[152:10.25]Oh, shit.
[152:11.79]Which one of these has been here longer?
[152:13.07]Oh, this one.
[152:16.91]Whatever.
[152:22.78]The Quaker Oats, Andy?
[152:24.66]What did that do?
[152:29.24]You know, humans are supposed to be just like... It is Amish.
[152:35.26]Fuck, it really is Amish.
[152:37.50]We're supposed to be like cutting wood and like growing beards.
[152:41.64]And like, oh yeah, absolutely.
[152:44.40]I'm the builder.
[152:45.62]I'm the butcher.
[152:46.74]I'm the banker.
[152:47.88]I'm supposed to be sitting here with this shit.
[152:53.09]I got a D, who cares?
[152:59.16]The Quaker guy is calling at 3 a.m.?
[153:00.94]What's it supposed to be?
[153:10.14]Okay, shockwave?
[153:18.69]Okay, can this do anything different?
[153:21.69]Okay.
[153:26.23]There's no Amish bankers.
[153:29.55]You know what I mean, though?
[153:30.81]I hope.
[153:37.12]So that, how, what does that do?
[153:38.26]Boom, okay.
[153:43.36]The Quaker Oats guy pretty much hated everything fun.
[153:47.44]Wait, really?
[153:50.42]Why are we calling him the Quaker Oats guy, by the way?
[153:53.24]What's that guy's name?
[153:57.18]The Quaker Oats guy, you don't know that.
[154:03.35]It's a Quaker.
[154:05.07]What's a Quaker?
[154:07.33]I know a Quaker is something out.
[154:08.83]What is it?
[154:09.93]His name was William Penn.
[154:12.67]He sucked.
[154:17.54]He sucked, dude.
[154:18.98]No, you don't want to know this guy.
[154:20.04]He sucked.
[154:23.80]Oh, he sucked, dude.
[154:24.96]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[154:46.84]Jerma failed 10th grade.
[154:48.42]No, I didn't fail 10th grade.
[154:50.02]I just haven't been in 10th grade in 20 years.
[154:55.41]It's been, I don't, I don't wake up in the morning and go, oh, William Penn, the Quaker.
[155:00.25]He was a Quaker and he hated fun and he sucked.
[155:02.71]I don't, I don't fucking do that.
[155:04.53]I'm an adult.
[155:05.70]I don't fucking think about school or history books.
[155:09.16]I, what are you talking about?
[155:12.06]What are you on about?
[155:30.32]This guy's on something.
[155:32.22]Ugh, whatever.
[155:37.13]Whoa.
[155:45.08]Weren't you a teacher?
[155:46.12]I wasn't a teacher!
[155:48.92]Guys, I think you severely underestimate what a substitute teacher is doing.
[156:12.25]Oh, that was a big one.
[156:33.46]Egomaniac says everybody underestimates his work.
[156:36.77]No, I was saying the opposite of what you're thinking.
[156:38.69]Okay, we're good.
[156:52.65]Oh, shut up.
[156:54.51]Not you guys.
[156:55.39]This guy.
[156:58.89]What are you?
[157:03.61]Could I have survived?
[157:06.54]What's going on?
[157:07.02]What's going on?
[157:07.40]What happened?
[157:07.78]I'm fine.
[157:08.88]I'm alive.
[157:10.94]No, dude.
[157:11.42]What the fuck happened?
[157:12.40]I freaked out because I was... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[157:13.98]Don't freak out.
[157:14.50]There's nobody here.
[157:25.88]I saw an orb.
[157:56.49]We're dead.
[158:18.34]Are you fucking kidding me?
[158:40.48]Where is he?
[158:53.88]I got it.
[159:04.93]Shut up!
[159:24.55]Oh my god!
[159:29.39]Fuck.
[159:29.83]Okay, we're good.
[159:32.07]Thankfully there's a checkpoint right here.
[159:40.16]Oh man, this is gonna be hard.
[159:41.44]It's hard, man.
[159:42.27]It's hard to do this.
[159:43.73]It's so easy just to like, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP.
[160:01.29]Can I not do that with this thing?
[160:05.81]I don't think I can do it with this thing.
[160:10.19]Okay.
[160:10.83]Let's get up there.
[160:12.84]Oh, I don't want to use that thing.
[160:13.70]That thing sucks.
[160:26.20]I touched it.
[160:37.01]What the fuck?
[161:00.48]What?
[161:07.47]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:18.03]Who's left?
[161:18.85]We're good.
[161:26.19]Where, where, where, where, where?
[161:35.84]Dude.
[162:16.12]Did I do it?
[162:16.54]I got it.
[162:17.96]I got it.
[162:19.34]I just scared the shit out of myself.
[162:20.42]I looked over here.
[162:25.25]Whoa, look at that.
[162:31.35]What are you doing?
[162:42.37]Was I supposed to do that?
[162:44.57]I think so.
[162:44.97]Okay, I got it.
[162:49.52]You have a runny nose?
[162:50.52]Whatever.
[162:52.40]That was hard.
[162:54.54]This dude is going insane!
[163:03.94]I love these epic high-octane gameplay.
[163:06.28]Wondering when the stream of Ratchet & Clank is coming for the PS2.
[163:09.50]I don't like any of those games.
[163:10.94]They're not for me.
[163:23.37]I'm... Okay, Ratchet & Clank, Jak & Daxter.
[163:27.93]I don't really play them.
[163:29.29]I didn't really care.
[163:32.15]I know, I'm sorry, but it's true.
[163:34.21]I didn't really care.
[163:34.83]It's not that I think they're bad, I just really didn't get into it.
[163:44.40]These guys have guns.
[163:51.56]Who else is left?
[163:54.78]Where's this person?
[164:08.28]Secret Oh Give me the shotgun.
[164:19.56]Yep.
[164:19.78]Oh
[165:05.11]No, I'm not going to... I don't know if I'm going to play Sly Cooper either.
[165:11.07]Oh, wait, did I... Do I have to power it or something?
[165:16.89]Why is the music so weird?
[165:18.45]Because it's an intense game.
[165:20.72]What do I have to do?
[165:34.04]Is there another one of these?
[165:37.60]Oh, of course.
[166:06.70]Okay.
[166:09.40]ULTRAKILL is so good.
[166:10.36]This game is really good.
[166:12.38]It's really intense.
[166:13.16]Alright, there's one more.
[166:16.40]Where is it?
[166:28.67]Over there?
[166:33.15]Yo!
[166:40.66]Where's this last one?
[166:41.36]I don't know.
[166:45.96]Where's this last one?
[166:52.85]There's one down there.
[166:54.15]One over here.
[166:54.95]So where's the other one?
[166:58.81]Follow the line.
[167:04.90]One, two...
[167:10.42]That one leads to here.
[167:14.79]I got this one.
[167:16.87]So then this one leads... This way.
[167:29.00]What?!
[167:30.75]What?! !
[167:51.43]Headshot, come on.
[167:54.71]Oh my goodness, you're here.
[168:12.48]Checkpoint.
[168:17.78]Alright, those guys melt wicked fast.
[168:40.28]Oh, I was trying to be cheeky with it.
[168:47.05]I was trying to slide up the whole thing.
[169:01.01]Only the Feedbacker can parry projectiles.
[169:04.05]Yeah, alright.
[169:18.04]Why parry if you can just fucking annihilate him like that?
[169:20.38]Whoa!
[169:41.14]What's that?
[169:43.21]Oh, it zooms in.
[169:44.94]Recharges even when unequipped.
[169:46.34]Switch weapons to keep fighting between shots.
[169:49.66]Oh.
[170:05.16]Shotgun.
[170:05.94]Shotgun's the best.
[170:32.71]Alright, there's one power.
[170:34.11]There's... What is the power over here?
[170:35.69]Somewhere.
[170:38.35]Power?
[170:38.75]Uh-oh.
[170:53.09]Wow!
[171:16.65]Get outta here!
[171:17.13]Alright, I need one more of those, uh... Electricity things.
[171:28.76]Holy shit, I need some-
[171:56.35]Look, look at us.
[171:57.11]What?
[171:57.59]I'm concentrating.
[171:59.55]I'm concentrating.
[172:04.21]Shoot the coins with the railgun?
[172:06.59]I ain't reading that shit.
[172:10.17]Why does he look like this?
[172:11.19]I... I don't know, dude.
[172:13.45]I don't... I don't know what you're talking... What do you want me to say?
[172:21.43]Shoot the wall.
[172:25.13]Oh, this one.
[172:25.77]You mean...
[172:32.14]Alright, where's the last electricity?
[172:51.81]Don't even fucking think about it, bro.
[172:54.69]What?
[172:55.29]No way, dude!
[172:56.33]What are you talking about?
[172:58.30]Are you shitting me?
[173:01.12]Fuck.
[173:02.03]Bad.
[173:14.28]Stupid.
[173:15.10]That was so stupid.
[173:18.04]Before you die in the game, honestly god, this is like what I don't like about games now, seriously.
[173:22.16]When I get to 0, it should go 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then go to 0, and then I die.
[173:32.64]And if I get one hit on anybody, it refills me to 100%.
[173:36.44]Like, that's so fucking annoying.
[173:37.48]Like, why?
[173:38.04]It's like... God, they don't make them like they used to, you know what I mean?
[174:15.73]Alright, that's two.
[174:16.74]The last one's down here.
[174:19.22]Somewhere... Alright.
[174:37.61]Wow!
[174:53.09]Somebody said, it looks like he's high on psychedelics.
[174:56.55]I'm just like sitting here, just like freaking out.
[175:13.08]Oh, that's funny.
[175:18.60]Whoa.
[175:19.64]Screwdriver, malicious.
[175:23.22]How much P do I have?
[175:26.68]Definitely not enough.
[175:28.66]Dude, you're just like rolling right now.
[175:34.20]What the fuck, dude?
[175:36.06]What?
[175:37.56]This is insane.
[175:39.53]This looks not even real.
[175:42.77]This is fucked up.
[175:48.15]Hold on.
[175:55.84]What on Earth is going on here?
[176:13.22]Why is this... What are you doing?
[176:15.42]Why is it doing that?
[176:24.19]Why is it doing this?
[176:27.61]I didn't want to do that.
[176:28.37]I don't know.
[176:38.24]I look like a different person.
[176:44.23]That does not even look like me.
[176:46.39]It looks like a different person.
[176:52.55]Cover the cam with that.
[177:04.20]What a stupid thing to have there.
[177:12.10]What is the sound?
[177:18.29]Super heart attack.
[177:19.39]This is okay.
[177:19.91]This level is called heart attack.

[177:36.24]Alright, fine.
[177:36.86]Wait, you mean like do THIS?
[178:06.31]How long does it take to get the thumbnail?
[178:11.89]How long will it take?
[178:13.07]A minute?

[180:21.21]It's not there yet?
[180:22.63]Well, why are you lying?
[180:27.51]Put a webcam on the bottom of that.

[182:49.70]Let me see.
[182:50.92]Good.
[182:52.72]We don't need this anymore.
[183:11.87]There we go, okay.
[183:12.75]Hey, we're back to normal.
[183:16.61]People are gonna click on that and just not kinda understand what's going on.
[183:19.98]I know, I'm not keeping it, no.
[183:24.46]Alright, so where do I put this stupid thing?
[183:30.57]Where do I put this dumb thing?
[183:42.72]It's underwater?
[183:43.68]Where underwater?

[184:17.57]I can prove it.
[184:21.83]I can prove that it's there.
[184:34.68]I have a screenshot right now.
[184:40.91]So this is what it looks like when you go to this category?
[184:45.19]Why is it so huge?
[184:49.39]Why is it so huge?
[184:57.74]Groggy Gary.
[184:59.30]Groggy Gary makes it sound like I'm just zonked.
[185:03.76]That's what that means.
[185:08.41]Hold on.
[185:13.68]Why is it so stretched out?
[185:24.25]What does the three mean?
[185:25.97]What is the three?
[185:27.89]Is that how long?
[185:28.53]It's been three minutes?
[185:29.77]It's been three hours.
[185:30.71]Oh, okay.
[185:33.85]Make this the thumbnail.
[185:35.59]No, dude.

[186:05.04]Okay.
[186:06.32]I need the... Should I just do it like this?
[186:16.26]Crop this and... Dude, cropping this is gonna take an extra...
[186:45.03]What?
[186:46.06]What is that?
[186:49.72]What the fuck was that?
[186:50.56]What did that say?
[186:52.72]Why did that just say something?
[186:53.84]Is it my name?
[186:54.70]What was that?
[186:55.84]What was that?
[186:57.54]What was that?
[186:58.38]What happened?
[187:04.87]Yeah, but wait.
[187:05.55]If this is the thumbnail, won't it just be the fucking thumbnail?
[187:11.13]I'm so confused by this because won't this just be the thumbnail?
[187:16.47]We're not doing anything different.
[187:20.70]It's just gonna, nothing's gonna change.
[187:32.29]Yes, it will.
[187:35.81]Well, it'll be layered.
[187:41.19]There'll be two titles.
[188:09.07]I can't, guys, I can't even see this.
[188:11.07]I need to make it a little bigger.
[188:12.05]Does that work?
[188:21.84]Am I in the right spot?
[188:26.64]Am I in the right spot?
[188:28.54]If I go right here?
[188:32.68]This makes sense, right?
[188:40.19]Okay.
[188:40.71]Alright.
[188:41.29]Let's go.
[189:02.50]Oh, there's a meat grinder right there.
[189:03.80]Shit.

[189:41.47]Shit, I wasted it.
[189:58.39]Okay, we're good, good, good.
[190:01.20]This gameplay is f- Whoa!

[190:13.97]Update?
[190:14.65]Is it there?
[190:17.95]What is- What the fuck?
[190:22.41]This is so weird.
[190:24.51]This is strange.
[190:33.62]This is going to start to get fucking weird, man.
[190:35.56]Hold on.
[190:37.83]No, I just replaced the game capture with a fucking image.
[190:42.31]Okay, there we go.
[190:56.30]Where is it?
[190:57.34]Oh, it's huge.
[190:57.90]That's why.
[191:01.02]What the fuck?
[191:06.21]What is happening?
[191:09.75]There it is.
[191:16.13]This is fucking insane.
[191:19.53]Even with like the view count.
[191:23.03]People are gonna think that there's something wrong with their computer.
[191:37.89]I don't think I can go anymore.
[191:40.11]Should I put... Hold on.
[191:41.53]What if I start putting it down here?
[191:42.95]I have an idea.
[191:54.56]Okay, where's the game?
[191:56.04]I need the game.
[192:01.53]Alright, this needs to be ahead of this.
[192:07.78]Like here.
[192:09.04]Right?
[192:11.53]And then I need to be here.
[192:21.55]Like that.
[192:22.75]Okay.
[192:24.47]Alright, let's go.
[192:25.00]I think that should be good.
[192:27.92]Okay.
[192:32.32]Okay.
[192:36.64]High pitched voice?
[192:37.64]What?
[192:39.18]Pitch up your voice.
[192:40.28]Why would that matter?
[192:43.04]Pitch up your... Why would that matter?
[192:44.90]It's an image.
[192:45.52]I don't understand.
[192:48.64]Just do it, please.
[192:49.62]I don't get it.
[192:51.38]Because I'm tiny?
[192:52.32]But I can't... You don't understand.
[192:56.77]I can't do that.
[192:57.91]I don't have my GoXLR plugged in anymore.
[193:01.73]So I can do this, but I don't know if that matters.
[193:05.99]It's because I'm tiny.
[193:07.33]Oh, okay, I see.
[193:09.65]Watch out.
[193:10.11]Okay, I'm gonna go this way.
[193:11.75]It's Meatwad.
[193:15.26]Ooh, red.
[193:17.38]Red, because I'm a Sith Lord.
[193:18.86]Uh-oh.
[193:23.13]What is that?
[193:23.67]Whoa!
[193:45.22]Do the voice.
[193:46.52]No!
[193:55.92]Where is he?
[193:58.35]Holy shit!
[193:59.59]Did I get him?
[194:03.65]Get out of the fucking water.
[194:18.88]What's he doing?
[194:20.58]Alright, I'm good.
[194:26.04]Do the voice.
[194:26.70]I'm not doing the voice.
[194:31.80]We got an update?
[194:58.23]Shit.
[195:03.36]We got an update?
[195:04.96]Alright, what do we got?
[195:11.62]This one's a bit better?
[195:12.70]Okay.
[195:12.94]Alright, I don't know how much more of this can we do.
[195:26.25]Like, look at this shit.
[195:27.21]Like, I don't know how much more can we actually.
[195:29.39]Well, the viewers keep going up.
[195:32.46]The viewers are increasing this whole time.
[195:36.14]That is so funny.
[195:38.20]I think that's the funniest part of this is the fact that the viewers have been going up by what looks like they leased into the thousands.
[195:46.39]Will that keep going up?
[195:54.30]Will that be like 18.5 next time?
[195:59.88]That's a great question.
[196:00.88]I have no idea.
[196:08.64]Okay.
[196:11.41]I'm going to move the game capture window again.
[196:14.95]The game capture can be a little bit bigger this time, right?
[196:17.75]Look at it.
[196:25.39]Like, it can be that.
[196:28.27]Cam needs to be changed, though.
[196:29.55]Okay.
[196:37.96]Alright.
[196:38.68]Is it going to keep going up?
[196:45.28]Alright, let's go.
[196:48.39]Add an iFunny watermark.
[196:50.17]No.
[196:51.39]No.
[196:54.79]No, no, I'm into this right now because I want to see.
[196:57.31]This is important.
[196:57.83]I want to see if the viewers keep going up.
[197:00.25]We're not quite there yet.
[197:12.74]Put scratches on the screen.
[197:14.24]Guys, you're going to have to give me a second.
[197:22.93]At some point, I'm gonna have to react to it with a big cam.
[198:03.79]Shit!
[198:07.57]That's gotta be it.
[198:21.67]Okay, I think that's good, right?
[198:28.73]Got it.

[199:34.73]There's another one.
[199:38.13]Let's go.
[199:41.48]Did the viewers drop?
[199:43.34]Or did it keep going?
[199:51.42]It's the same?
[199:51.94]18.2?
[199:52.46]I need a red circle.
[199:54.97]Anybody got an image?

[205:03.73]Yeah, after this, I'm going to do a React cam where it's big and I'm... Wow, am I fucking concerned.
[205:14.17]Why would I put Goku on it?
[205:19.05]Or put Master Chief on it and then react to it?
[205:35.57]Do I have to go backwards?
[205:42.00]Is this going to kill me?

[213:54.36]I need that.
[213:54.60]I need that.
[213:54.90]I need that.
[213:55.86]I need this one because I'm going to look up at it.
[214:01.59]Oh, we actually got it.
[214:02.37]I got it.
[214:02.63]We got it.
[214:02.87]We got it.
[214:03.11]We actually got it.
[214:03.71]We actually got it.
[214:05.33]It actually did come through.
[214:06.03]Hold on.
[214:10.25]Did it actually come through?
[214:14.54]This is fucked.
[214:16.66]Hold on.
[214:16.98]I need to...
[214:22.44]Wait, are they in the right spot?
[214:31.51]What the fuck?
[214:32.53]Hold on.
[214:55.60]Hold on, it says 20k viewers now?
[215:00.04]Where is it?
[215:05.97]Fuck, hold on, I gotta get up there.
[215:08.22]I'm losing track of shit.
[215:34.42]I think we're going a little too far I think we're going too far
[216:29.47]Add question mark.
[216:31.02]Okay.
[216:31.52]Alright.
[216:31.76]One more after this and I'm done.
[216:39.06]Add Saul Goodman.
[216:41.53]I can't.
[216:58.78]I'll add Walter White, the one where he's like... You know what I mean?
[217:03.03]Did we get it?
[217:03.43]Update?
[217:10.83]We got one?
[217:17.12]I don't know what else to do with this, though.
[217:18.70]Like, what the fuck is this?
[217:20.16]Okay, hold on.
[217:20.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:24.08]There's too many things on the screen.
[217:25.20]I don't know what's real and what's not real right now.
[217:28.85]You know, I don't know what is and isn't real.
[217:30.91]It's actually kind of hard to figure that out.
[217:40.28]Um, okay.
[217:42.62]I'm going to go away.
[217:45.08]Wait, what happened?
[217:45.88]What happened to the other one?
[217:47.22]Wait, this one just got up.
[217:48.28]No, this is not even an update.
[217:49.78]This one, what happened to me down here?
[217:53.18]What?
[217:54.36]I'm fucking, I'm so confused.
[217:55.98]What's going on?
[217:58.17]This is a different one.
[217:59.01]I'll put this here.
[218:18.31]Okay let's add this one.
[218:24.24]Alright, I have to stop after this because I have to go- I have to play a fucking video game, guys.
[218:28.46]I can't just keep adding things.
[218:37.00]Um, okay, where's- was that one more?
[218:46.70]This is gonna be it after this.
[218:47.82]No more, no more.
[219:00.95]Okay.
[219:13.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:16.40]No, I don't want to screw it up.
[219:17.18]I don't want to screw it up.
[219:17.86]Hold on.
[219:18.10]I'm going to make this be transparent in the background.
[219:21.92]Like he's like, what the fuck?
[219:23.50]I can't believe this video.
[219:24.56]Alright, hold on.
[219:25.30]I'm going to make him transparent.
[219:54.37]Is that good?
[219:56.11]Where's the game?
[219:58.85]I lost the game.
[219:59.61]Okay.
[220:14.93]I just burped.
[220:21.31]Isn't there, wait, is there another one?
[220:32.57]Alright, this is it.
[220:33.17]This is the last one.
[220:42.54]Move the face?
[221:03.19]Are we good?
[221:03.55]Somebody said a worse joke.
[221:31.37]At this point, I kind of don't care.
[221:32.71]At this point, it's like I have to finish it.
[221:34.55]I need to add Miku.
[221:42.96]My lips just stuck together.
[221:44.12]I haven't had my mouth open for so long.
[221:56.23]Okay, I got it.
[221:57.13]There's a Miku in the mod chat right now that I'm going to use.
[222:01.15]And it's perfect.
[222:21.02]There's an update.
[222:22.42]I got the update.
[222:23.76]Alright, update is here.
[222:24.99]We're good.
[222:26.07]I'm gonna add this one more and then I'm done.
[222:28.93]We're gonna get one more thumbnail out of this and I'm done.
[222:38.20]What the fuck?
[222:39.78]Hold on.
[222:42.24]Where is that?
[222:43.84]Oy.
[222:43.96]Oy.
[222:52.05]Walter White needs to be... It's because Walter White is already on it.
[222:57.49]What's going on?
[223:00.45]Okay, Walter White was already on it.
[223:02.19]That's why it was fucked up looking, okay?
[223:06.00]But... I need... Um... Uh...
[223:38.98]No, I'm not using that one.
[223:40.68]I'm not using that one.
[223:49.47]Alright, fine.
[223:49.99]I'll use it.
[223:51.57]What do I care?
[223:52.33]But why would this even be on here?
[223:56.89]Why would this even be on here?
[223:58.55]Why would that image be on here?
[224:04.48]Well, let's find out.
[224:09.12]Okay, you guys are gonna laugh, but I mean, whatever.
[224:11.02]I guess we're gonna use this one.
[224:15.27]I'll use both.
[224:16.05]Fuck it.
[224:16.39]I don't care.
[224:34.96]Okay.
[224:36.96]And then I'm gonna use this one.
[224:50.14]I think this is going to be the end.
[224:52.06]Alright, let's add that.
[224:59.73]My OBS is so fucked up right now.
[225:01.55]It's a joke.
[225:02.59]It's such a mess.
[225:03.31]Okay.
[225:10.75]I just need to be transparent because she's going to be peeking over.
[225:14.71]Wait, hold on.
[225:15.51]Shit.
[225:15.93]Get it out of the way in case it takes the thumbnail.
[225:24.64]Okay, I need to do some editing on this.
[225:29.86]I'm going to keep a face here, though, so I can make sure.
[225:40.52]Just in case.
[225:48.82]Okay, she looks kind of fucked up.
[225:52.02]But I don't... It's okay.
[226:55.84]I think someone just said, why do people watch this?
[226:59.52]I don't know.
[227:04.72]I don't know.
[227:05.24]Dude, I don't know.
[227:06.10]I'm sorry.
[227:06.70]I don't know.
[227:18.05]PogFace instead?
[227:43.26]Add your soy pointing meme.
[227:56.63]Okay, and then we're done.
[228:02.21]Update?
[228:06.31]Do we have an update?
[228:12.49]Okay, then we're gonna add the soy pointing meme.
[228:14.70]Is there a transparent one of those?
[228:16.12]I don't think I have one.
[228:18.34]I don't have one of those.
[228:21.82]The live is covering my face up here.
[228:24.81]It's so stupid.
[228:42.75]God damn it.
[228:44.07]Where?
[228:47.69]But I can't... Okay, we need to move some shit.
[229:04.73]Um, I don't know where else to put this.
[229:14.01]I'm running out of things to put.
[229:15.41]I don't know where to put this fucking thing.
[229:22.45]Okay.
[229:22.83]Wait.
[229:23.72]You have this?
[229:25.72]Oh my goodness.
[229:26.96]Okay.
[229:27.54]I'm done.
[229:27.94]I actually am done after this.
[229:29.48]We are done after this.
[229:35.04]This is it.
[229:36.14]This is the end.
[229:50.80]Oh my fucking god.
[229:54.68]But they're too big!
[229:55.90]They're so huge!
[229:58.22]They need to be smaller.
[230:11.89]Fuck.
[230:12.81]They're too big.
[230:20.19]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, before it changes.
[230:45.53]Make them pointed among us.
[230:47.15]Better idea.
[230:47.45]You're right, you're right, you're right.
[231:33.09]I need an arm.
[231:51.61]We get it?
[231:53.05]It's there?
[231:53.37]Alright, we got it, got it, got it, got it.
[231:54.29]Alright, let's see.
[231:57.09]What does the culmination of this whole thing look like?
[232:00.13]Because that's it.
[232:00.77]I'm done.
[232:02.97]I'm done with this.
[232:04.67]It's fucking crazy.
[232:06.97]Okay, I need to turn everything off.
[232:12.25]Everything has to go off.
[232:16.24]So we can see what it actually looks like at the end.
[232:23.80]Okay, are you ready for the culmination of what is the thumbnail right now?
[232:28.34]Here you go.
[232:30.58]Welcome to hell.
[232:32.04]This is what people are seeing.
[232:34.12]It only takes like an hour to do this.
[232:52.60]You can't even see the Miku stuff.
[233:04.58]Jesus.
[233:09.50]Okay, that was fun.
[233:13.68]The best part about this, honestly, is the perspective changing.
[233:17.74]It is... Everything is flattening.
[233:25.89]The whole game category is fucked up.
[233:27.99]What is going on here?
[233:32.80]What are you guys doing?
[233:33.68]What are you guys doing?
[233:37.98]This is the... Alright, what the fuck are you guys doing?

[233:52.41]Oh boy.
[233:52.95]Well, the dev was here.
[233:54.15]Sorry we're not playing the game.
[234:02.07]Okay, it's, whatever.
[234:05.37]Jerma's Odyssey?
[234:06.53]What is going on?
[234:09.53]World Record.
[234:10.95]Okay.
[234:12.81]Play the game.
[234:22.76]Alright, you guys, come on.
[234:24.50]Alright, come on, come on.
[234:29.32]ASO, that's, you're not even in the right category.
[234:32.54]You're not even in the right category!
[234:34.06]Alright, alright, let's get out of here.
[234:36.36]You're in the wrong category.
[234:37.34]You guys, cut the shit.
[234:42.31]Okay.
[234:42.97]Where's the game?
[234:47.37]Alright, um... That was... very interesting.

[234:56.02]Oh my goodness.
[235:02.45]I have to navigate through all this shit on my, hold on.
[235:08.19]Oh my God.
[235:15.87]Can somebody get me a decent screenshot of that so I can put it on here?
[235:19.14]Cause I can't pull it through Twitter.
[235:27.78]Where's the actual camera?
[235:28.92]I don't know where it went.
[235:32.28]okay there's the cam let me just let me go one by one here and get this fixed what how long have I been sitting here for why does this look weird something's off about this camera now why something's weird about it is it squished or something

[236:00.03]Something's off.
[236:14.07]Is that better?
[236:14.83]I think I fixed it.
[236:19.46]Was my head that long?
[236:23.68]I actually don't know.
[236:32.44]I think I got it.
[236:33.34]Okay, we're in a good spot.
[236:38.30]Now I need the game back.
[236:40.51]Just the video game, wherever it is.
[236:42.37]Okay.
[236:49.23]Oh, that's not right.
[236:50.11]Alright.
[236:53.78]Okay.
[236:54.76]We're back to normal.
[236:57.84]Things look okay.
[236:59.34]We're good.
[237:01.42]The dev tweet.
[237:06.85]Okay, hold on.
[237:07.33]The dev tweeted a picture of... Okay, that says... The dev's here.
[237:12.59]Sorry, I'm not playing the game.
[237:13.88]My brother in Christ.
[237:14.92]I made the game.
[237:15.58]I've seen it already.
[237:16.26]I'd rather watch whatever the fuck this is.
[237:24.84]Oh, man.
[237:25.16]Sorry, I'm not playing the game.
[237:26.25]Yeah.
[237:27.01]Alright, let's check this out.
[237:34.37]Look at this.
[237:36.60]Look at this insanity.
[237:39.71]What is going on here?
[237:44.48]Is this a smoking image?
[238:03.66]It's cyber grind textures.
[238:05.32]I don't know what that means, but alright.
[238:10.78]Okay.
[238:12.97]I'm going to attempt to do something here.
[238:14.51]I'm going to attempt to play the game again because I'm going to play the game.
[238:24.66]That seems like a fun idea.
[238:31.74]I think that's what we're gonna do.
[238:33.04]We're gonna play, uh... Okay, so what was I doing?
[238:36.66]That was fun.
[238:37.56]I forget how to play the game.
[238:38.84]I actually do.
[238:39.98]I really don't.
[238:40.50]I don't remember how to play.
[238:42.64]I don't remember how to play the game.
[238:43.48]I have to relearn the game.
[238:53.25]Okay, um... I'm fighting a boss right now.
[238:57.91]Let's fight this boss.
[239:00.15]I should probably take a break.
[239:01.84]Alright, if I don't do it right now, then... Alright, I'm gonna take a break.
[239:29.28]Shit, it's hard.
[239:30.32]Oh my goodness.
[239:50.24]Fuck!
[239:55.98]How am I supposed to do this?
[240:01.72]Do I have to get close?
[240:40.71]Got it.
[240:42.81]I'm smart.
[240:49.89]This is going to be a part two.
[240:55.49]Nice.
[240:55.75]Checkpoint.
[240:56.25]Good.
[240:58.84]Hold on.
[240:59.10]I got to move this.
[241:00.64]Okay.
[241:08.10]Let's go.
[241:13.22]Have you ever thought about making your own game?
[241:16.76]Maybe over the years, yeah.
[241:17.92]It's just... It's a lot of time, a lot of work.
[241:24.94]Devs and getting people... It's just... I had an idea at one point.
[241:30.82]Why do you look rendered?
[241:32.53]Because I have greasy, oily skin.
[241:42.52]How am I going to ever afford that?
[241:50.60]Okay.
[241:59.35]I need a red skull to get in there.
[242:01.89]Sounds good.
[242:02.89]So we're going to just keep going, right?
[242:05.55]Let's just go.
[242:05.89]Am I going the right way?
[242:09.85]I hope so.
[242:19.61]Oh, there it is.
[242:20.01]That was easy.
[242:39.48]That was easy.
[242:42.66]Uh-oh.
[242:44.60]It's time to...
[242:56.51]Excuse me.
[243:07.80]Wow!
[243:08.92]That hurt.
[243:14.42]I need to get... What's that do?
[243:18.44]I don't know.
[243:18.80]What do I do?
[243:22.57]What happened?
[243:23.55]I need to get help from the hand over there.
[243:31.31]Yikes!
[243:35.73]No, shit!
[243:46.69]Oops.
[243:52.67]No!
[243:59.59]I don't understand how to get up that high.
[244:47.34]I tried to hit the button and my fucking finger wouldn't do it.
[245:19.17]Fuck you.
[245:53.08]That didn't fucking work.
[245:54.12]I tried to dodge it.
[246:08.00]That shit just fucking killed me in one hit.
[246:10.40]What's going on?
[246:17.65]He's too big.
[246:18.69]I don't...
[246:32.46]If I stay up here, he just goes like this and I can't dodge it.
[246:43.91]Bro, it's fucking... He takes up the whole map with his swing.
[246:59.31]Why did that...
[247:14.74]No parry?
[247:16.94]He's not glowing yellow.
[247:27.08]You can't parry it.
[247:27.96]I just tried.
[247:38.24]You can't parry.
[247:39.06]That was stupid.
[247:43.52]Just shut up.
[247:55.31]I didn't know you could parry it.
[247:56.23]I thought it had to be a projectile.
[248:30.77]I'm not grunting!
[248:32.23]What is- what are you- what sex noises are you talking about?
[248:35.43]I'm not- I've been silent the whole time!
[248:37.31]I don't understand the parry, man.
[248:49.74]I just- that looked fucking pretty clean to me.
[249:25.23]Where am I?
[249:26.59]I can't fucking move, man.
[249:43.90]No way.
[249:51.07]And you fucking float around like in fucking low gravity.
[250:16.53]How is that not a parry?
[250:17.93]I don't get it.
[250:29.69]Oh my fucking god, you slug.
[250:31.69]What do I do?
[250:43.31]What do I do?
[250:43.65]Whoa!
[251:13.48]Yeah, fucking right!
[251:14.58]How?
[251:15.88]What is the frame?
[251:16.62]Is it one frame that I get to parry?
[251:28.67]Dude, excuse me.
[251:30.75]How are those wrong?
[251:34.21]Excuse me!
[251:34.97]Excuse me!
[251:42.43]I don't understand.
[251:43.25]It's like it won't do it.
[251:46.79]Am I doing it too late or too early?
[251:48.35]Fuck that.
[251:49.64]Fuck that.
[251:50.24]What do you mean too late?
[251:58.02]He's not even up.
[252:00.92]Bro.
[252:01.98]No.
[252:03.04]I don't understand the timing.
[252:04.18]It doesn't make any sense.
[252:24.00]Shut up.
[252:50.28]What the fuck, man?
[252:52.10]What are you talking about?
[252:53.10]This is not the easiest boss in the game.
[252:54.98]Get out of here.
[252:55.58]You played on fucking easy.
[252:57.73]You played on easy.
[253:09.83]Now.
[253:10.30]It doesn't make any sense.
[253:12.86]It doesn't make any logical sense as to why these aren't hitting.
[253:19.79]That's a parry.
[253:20.79]That's a parry in every parry game I've ever parried.
[253:22.73]That's a parry.
[253:23.39]I parried that in any parry game.
[253:25.18]That's a parry right there.
[253:26.08]I just did a parry.
[253:26.66]That's a parry literally in every single parry game you've ever played.
[253:31.00]That's a parry right there.
[253:31.66]That's a parry in every single game that has a parry, no matter what it is.
[253:39.56]This is literally impossible.
[253:43.30]I did that.
[253:44.11]Time it.
[253:44.69]Go back and slow down.
[253:46.11]Go back and do slow motion.
[253:47.01]I did that.
[253:47.69]I did it perfectly.
[253:48.45]Every time.
[253:49.52]Go back and slow down.
[253:51.68]Quiet.
[254:22.79]I hate falling off and you know what it is dude like falling off the legend like floating down just makes me want to fucking bite my fucking hands off
[254:56.13]This is so hard.
[254:58.37]It's just the timing with the stup- It's just that I have such a small area and I float around like a fucking- I wanna ju- Where's the double jump?
[255:18.10]I don't want a triple dash.
[255:19.49]I want a double jump.
[255:20.99]Where's the upgrades where I can put that shit in the game?
[255:29.71]I want a... What are you?
[255:48.98]What are you?
[255:49.56]What?
[255:54.78]I gotta heal right now.
[256:00.83]What happened?
[256:01.37]What?
[256:22.60]STOP FALLING OFF THIS STUPID, TINY PLATFORM!
[256:25.76]The game, there's so much fast movement, that like, oh, wait, carefully, don't slide up that, son!
[256:31.41]It's fucking two inches!
[256:32.61]It's quiet.
[256:34.67]I'm fucking losing it, relax.
[257:07.81]Now get up there and stop it!
[257:12.01]Get back up there!
[257:16.32]You stupid piece of shit, you have to be kidding me.
[257:31.46]No!
[257:34.51]You can't!
[257:35.38]That was it!
[257:36.14]That was the end of the fucking game!
[257:37.70]I don't get it!
[257:52.11]I don't get it!
[257:52.94]Because it feels like I'm landing those well!
[258:29.57]Alright
[258:57.77]The speedrun for that fight is two seconds.
[259:00.67]I'm trying so badly not to make, like, sounds, but I fucking can't help it.
[259:04.25]I got a D. I don't care.
[259:05.94]Oh, shit.
[259:06.32]This is it.
[259:06.68]I got two more levels.
[259:09.38]It's alright.
[259:09.82]Relax.
[259:10.38]Whoa.
[259:27.08]Get out of here.
[259:27.58]What is this bullshit?
[259:28.74]You need to watch the clip.
[259:32.63]What clip?
[259:39.32]What clip?
[260:01.65]I'm just not good enough to fucking do it.
[260:27.11]What?
[260:45.50]Oh, MonkaS.
[260:53.09]Shut up.
[261:37.96]Oh shit, that's not it.
[261:51.52]That it?
[261:54.48]Best of luck, VOD watchers.
[261:57.06]What happened?
[262:06.62]You just went goblin mode.
[262:11.05]I am making weird noises, aren't I?
[262:14.40]What?
[262:17.64]I'm going like... That's what I sound like when I'm concentrating?
[262:28.77]What?
[262:32.13]Is it because I have the audio in my ears?
[262:43.05]I mean, that was really loud and horrible, but, like, what do you want me to do?
[262:46.17]That was, like, loud and horrible.
[262:55.12]This looks like... This looks like an actor watched, you know, like, maybe one to two hundred hours of Twitch streams to research a role where he plays a Twitch streamer in a movie.
[263:13.68]And that's what I'm doing.
[263:22.09]Yeah, that's interesting.
[263:23.71]We're... My voice is, like, gone now, too.
[263:31.71]Breathing's definitely noticeable.
[263:32.89]That's because I don't have a noise gate anymore.
[263:40.43]Ooh, look at this.
[263:43.11]I really do go like... Fuck!
[263:45.31]I gotta fix that by next stream.
[263:49.45]Why can't I break this?
[263:57.62]Can I not break that?
[264:02.00]I don't get it.
[264:10.11]What's going on?
[264:10.59]Holy shit.
[264:54.65]Did I win?
[264:57.62]I've been silent.
[264:58.82]What are you talking about?
[265:00.82]I've been silent the whole time.
[265:14.08]What?
[265:15.26]What the fuck?
[265:18.96]Huh?
[265:32.68]Is this what you were talking about?
[265:59.56]That's fucked up.
[266:00.56]Why am I, why do I do that?
[266:03.21]Why do I do that?
[266:04.51]I'm serious.
[266:05.13]Why am I doing that?
[266:06.03]I'm going... What?
[266:08.09]I'm going... Look at the dev tweet.
[266:13.35]Honest to fucking god, I didn't even know I was doing that.
[266:16.69]I swear to god, this is what's usually blocked.
[266:22.58]What did the dev say?
[266:34.27]I don't... I guess I just make weird sounds.
[266:37.49]Grunted Gary.
[266:38.69]I guess I just make weird sounds with my mouth, I guess.
[266:44.19]I thought you guys were seriously just messing around.
[266:48.63]40-year-old man.
[266:51.52]I did not... I... I didn't... Whatever.
[266:53.52]I'm just gonna keep playing the game.
[266:59.26]It's because, you know what?
[266:59.94]I have both headphones in, so... And it's loud.
[267:03.55]And I'm really gaming, and every so often I'm kind of like... Oh my fucking god, guys.
[267:10.11]That's actually embarrassing.
[267:12.23]Whatever, who cares.
[267:26.20]Supreme!
[267:29.98]Oops.
[267:30.96]That don't die, right?
[267:57.50]Did I do it?
[267:58.30]Did I just do it?
[267:59.92]Did I just do it?
[268:05.32]No?
[268:05.50]Are you sure?
[268:06.03]I kind of felt like I did.
[268:07.81]I have to climb all the way up?
[269:13.51]Goodbye.
[269:13.85]Holy shit, there's so many.
[269:27.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[269:32.79]Ugh, fuck, this is hard.
[269:34.67]Stay with the shotgun.
[269:35.79]This is the best weapon in the game.
[269:37.39]Nothing is better than this.
[269:51.03]Mmm.
[270:24.39]No, no, no, no.
[270:24.99]Don't you dare.
[270:25.93]Don't you dare.
[270:26.83]Okay.
[270:48.84]Let's go.
[270:58.77]Checkpoint up there.
[271:02.20]Oh my god.
[271:02.64]Get to the checkpoint.
[271:03.22]Just touch the checkpoint.
[271:03.96]Touch it.
[271:05.09]Yeah.
[271:38.17]Get up.
[271:38.89]Get up!
[271:44.75]Stop going in the water.
[271:45.39]I fucking hate the water.
[271:46.37]Get the water out of here.
[271:47.11]Delete it.
[271:47.47]It's gonna kill me.
[271:55.68]This fucking poison water is gonna kill me.
[271:57.70]I hate water in video games.
[272:00.18]I hate going into water.
[272:02.26]Water sucks.
[272:03.12]It's so annoying to play in a video game.
[272:33.03]I hate water!
[273:05.31]Yeah.
[273:08.33]I need a checkpoint right... Ooh, that's it.
[273:11.23]I did it.
[273:12.07]Alright, this is 3-2.
[273:12.65]I think this is the end of the game.
[273:13.84]3-2?
[273:14.32]When are you going to play Freddy Fish?
[273:17.86]Curse of the Fish or whatever?
[273:19.06]Whatever this stupid fucking kids game is.
[273:21.50]I don't know.
[273:22.28]Next week.
[273:27.87]Ooh.
[273:34.09]Fires a powerful drill that sticks to an enemy and deals damage over time.
[273:39.13]The drill causes enemies to bleed continuously with extra healing range.
[273:43.48]Okay, let's heal on.
[273:49.84]Fires an instant beam that causes a large explosion on impact, similar to a certain familiar face.
[273:54.60]Wipes out groups of weak enemies with ease.
[273:56.10]I think I want this.
[274:04.54]So that sticks on them?
[274:09.71]I'll try it.
[274:38.35]OK.
[275:16.08]Now what?
[275:18.82]So I'm a robot.
[275:22.04]And I'm defying my maker.
[275:50.90]What the hell is that?
[276:13.89]What the fuck?
[276:24.94]I missed!
[276:25.42]No I didn't.
[276:37.02]That's... Holy shit in my fucking pants.
[277:12.07]Oh my god!
[277:44.49]Dude, I think I got him.
[277:54.14]Dude, it's so fucking ridiculous.
[277:58.88]Yo.
[278:04.10]Should I block him?
[278:09.37]Can I block those?
[278:25.99]This shit's happening too fast.
[278:33.61]I'm 37 years old, guys.
[278:36.37]I don't think I can do it.
[278:43.01]Guys, I'm 37.
[278:43.51]This is like a 19-year-old's brain can handle this.
[278:48.41]I'm too old.
[278:49.64]I think I'm too old to do this.
[279:07.75]How did I miss from... Relax.
[279:14.15]I don't even have time to think.
[279:16.15]It happens so quickly.
[279:18.02]I just like, by the time he dashes, it's like, I don't even know, where do I go?
[279:20.82]What should I do?
[279:37.65]What the fuck, man?
[279:39.07]What?
[279:39.39]This game's on x5 speed.
[280:09.10]I can't even turn around fast enough to fight this guy!
[280:24.73]Where... I...
[280:48.08]No way, man.
[280:49.16]I don't think so.
[280:51.11]I don't fucking think so.
[280:54.97]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[281:20.86]Guys... You know what?
[281:32.31]Okay, in the time for me to move... My... My ring finger to hit shift.
[281:38.26]He's already hit me.
[281:39.76]Or control.
[281:40.60]It's like... My brain can't go faster than he can.
[281:43.82]He's like just... He's like programmed to go fucking faster than me.
[282:25.37]Dude, I don't even, where are you going?
[282:36.65]Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come!
[282:57.47]Fuck you, I missed!

[283:38.38]No, I should be like, I should be baking the fucking muffins.

[286:34.97]NO!
[286:35.39]I- I don't want- alright.
[286:37.75]Can I just delete all the weapons besides the shotgun and the- I don't want to like- I don't want to use anything but these two weapons.
[286:59.89]I'm fucking dead.
[287:00.69]I'm dead.
[287:03.78]I'm dead.
[287:04.30]Oh my god.

[287:10.32]How do I delete them right now?
[287:11.22]Get rid of them.
[287:11.64]I don't want them.
[287:12.12]Delete them!

[289:08.43]Get this shotgun away too!
[289:10.15]There's no point in me having this equipped!
[289:13.63]What's the point of me using the shotgun?
[289:16.52]It doesn't do anything!
[289:24.58]Just delete the fucking shotgun!
[289:26.12]It has no fucking purpose!
[289:27.36]This has no purpose!

[292:01.90]What are you supposed to do about this motherfucker?
[292:08.87]I'm gonna save it.
[292:09.43]Hold on.
[292:16.14]No fucking way.
[292:17.58]You're doing everything wrong?
[292:23.24]No parry?
[292:25.18]I'd like you to parry this for me.
[292:28.47]Oh, I'm sorry.
[292:28.97]That was loud too.

[298:17.06]I'm playing a game that's literally not completable.
[298:19.20]It's impossible, and of course I'm going to have a little bit of a sweaty scenario.
[298:23.00]Okay?
[298:23.30]Everything's fine.

[301:32.80]What the fuck just happened?
[301:34.18]I parried him accidentally!
[302:20.00]This is what animal does.
[302:21.82]Animal from the Muppets, whenever he runs around, he goes like...
[302:39.34]OK.
[302:39.46]OK.
[302:50.15]OK.
[302:52.65]OK.

[303:45.95]Jesus Christ.
[303:47.35]It's... I... I don't... Dude, I don't... It's... It's just everything is happening so quickly.
[303:57.13]And so many explosive shit he has.
[303:59.89]And then he gets angry and everything becomes one hit kill.
[304:03.50]Oh, what?
[304:05.26]Why?
[304:05.90]What?
[304:11.90]I got it.
[304:12.16]I got it.
[304:12.38]I got it this time.
[304:12.92]I'm gonna win.
[304:13.30]I'm gonna win.
[304:13.58]I'm gonna win.
[304:21.20]Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, slow down.
[304:25.55]I just need to hit you with this.
[304:26.39]I got it.
[304:35.29]Oh, my God.
[304:39.22]It's so ridiculous.
[304:40.92]I can't fucking believe it.
[304:44.71]It's just like... It's just...
[305:14.36]What the fuck am I gonna do with that shit?
[305:15.97]What the hell was that for?
[305:45.12]Oh, fuck off!
[305:59.80]I don't even know where the fuck the guy goes.
[306:06.74]It's just loud sound effects, and...
[306:21.71]I can't... I can't block him!
[306:31.93]Increase your FOV?
[306:33.23]What the fuck is this person talking about?
[306:47.38]That's not gonna help.
[306:58.19]This feels off.
[307:00.09]I missed.
[307:00.35]Just kill me.
[307:14.14]Shut up.
[307:16.52]That's the problem.
[307:39.36]It's just like CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.
[307:42.00]It's fucking so ridiculous. It's too- it's ridiculous man.
[308:01.00]This is the end! This is the end right here!
[308:04.00]No it's not. Oh my goddammit.
[308:16.31]I don't even care.
[308:17.01]I'm just going to dodge and shoot him.
[308:20.99]Oh, this actually is pretty easy.
[308:54.09]It's still fucking impossible.
[308:56.32]It really is still fucking impossible.
[309:40.88]There's a fucking thousand volts in my chair.
[310:03.53]No!
[310:13.19]I have to get him down to half with just a regular revolver.
[310:15.84]I have to.
[310:17.00]It's not fucking possible any other way.
[310:20.76]And like the amount of buttons... Guys, I probably pressed the buttons 5,000, 10,000 times.
[310:24.57]Humans were not supposed to be doing this.
[310:26.95]You understand?
[310:27.51]We were supposed to be drinking water.
[310:30.23]And not like... Like no fucking way.
[310:34.21]We were supposed to be doing this shit.
[310:35.96]We were supposed to be... Amish had it right.
[311:12.38]What did it switch?
[311:13.28]I hit Q accidentally.
[311:15.04]I touched Q and it switched fucking weapons.
[311:22.17]Oh.
[311:27.60]Unbind queue.
[311:29.14]Just unbind it.
[311:29.76]It's going to accidentally be pressed.
[311:30.98]Oh my fucking God.
[311:36.45]Just take it off.
[311:37.21]I don't want any of this shit.
[311:39.75]Delete it.
[311:40.85]Delete this.
[311:41.85]Delete it.
[311:43.17]How do I remove it?
[311:46.25]I'm going to make it like fucking equal sign of something I'm never going to touch.
[311:50.73]Okay.
[311:51.39]So we're going to do some breathing exercises now.
[311:53.59]Okay.
[311:59.41]That feels good.
[311:59.85]It feels pretty good.
[312:03.10]It feels pretty good.
[312:04.36]I wish I was using one of these.
[312:10.66]Not like this.
[312:14.46]Okay.
[312:17.77]Oh!
[312:54.26]I just had to hold my breath for fucking a few minutes.
[313:01.06]How can this be?
[313:03.54]Best by this... this... thing?
[313:08.62]You insignificant fuck!
[313:10.18]This is not over!
[313:12.46]May your woes be many, and your days few.
[313:50.27]89 restarts, yo!
[314:01.20]Is this a Meltdown stream?
[314:02.46]No, it's not.
[314:04.12]It was an intense gaming stream.
[314:08.47]Disgrace, humiliation, unseemly and unwelcome at the feet of the council.
[314:16.47]Their eyes ablaze with bitter resentment glaring through Gabriel's wounds of body and soul.
[314:21.50]Bore outward for all to see.
[314:23.84]Has this one abandoned the way of our creator?
[314:26.72]It is unworthy of its holy light.
[314:29.16]The father's light is indomitable.
[314:32.33]This one sees fit to squander it.
[314:35.00]Their words resonated in Gabriel's limbs, coursing through as lightning upon wire, a searing hiss that would strike lesser's deaf and blind.
[314:45.58]The holy light within him, an unstoppable storm of divine fury, insurmountable for mere... I'm not... I'm a normal person, okay?
[314:52.72]Let's just get that out of the way.
[314:54.53]This he knew.
[314:55.61]Holy counsel, my devotion to our creator is absolute.
[314:58.09]I have never strayed from the will of the Father, but a machine.
[315:02.21]You dare imply the might of the... Yeah, somebody will read this.
[315:06.22]impossible hearsay unspeakable heresy silence your treachery will not be tolerated as punishment the father's light shall be severed from your body you have 24 hours I'm like objecting in a courtroom you have 24 hours before the last of the embers die out and you with them prove your loyalty unmake your mistakes
[315:31.12]as the light was ripped from his being Gabriel's screams were silenced in the hiss of gospel in praise of god a boiling anguish to which even the fires of hell could not compare it's pretty up if the machines seek blood he would give it freely and with such fury even metal will bleed whatever act two imperfect hatred
[316:01.12]Coming soon.
[316:06.13]Do I have Act 2?
[316:11.25]Do I have Act 2?
[316:19.22]There's four more levels.
[316:20.76]Oh.
[316:23.28]Great.
[316:25.91]Can't wait.
[316:34.86]These are going to be a breeze, are they?
[316:40.13]The voice actor for that character made fun of me.
[316:42.27]That was funny.
[316:52.47]Alright, turn the music back on.
[316:53.35]Yeah.
[317:02.35]Greed.
[317:16.96]Shitstorm?
[317:37.09]I got ULTRAKILL, I'm fine.
[317:45.54]Put the music up louder?
[317:49.67]Stop complaining.
[318:04.88]Oh, shit.
[318:21.63]And he's, uh... He's using 100% of his brain.
[318:25.24]Be careful.
[318:38.28]Oopsie.
[318:39.04]Oopsie.
[318:39.46]Am I dead?
[318:45.43]Yep.
[319:05.70]Take a break.
[319:07.24]I'm good.
[319:11.84]There's a bug in my ear.
[319:13.25]There's so much shit in the way.
[319:29.28]Get these fucking pillars out of here.
[320:09.14]Anarchy!
[320:15.28]Where are you?
[320:15.71]Where?
[320:17.63]Where?
[320:19.51]Where are you?
[320:22.71]Where the fuck is this person?
[320:23.69]What?
[321:05.60]Hey!
[321:20.50]What did I just do?
[321:21.32]What did I just do?
[321:23.10]Itchy armpits.
[321:25.38]You need to do some... You need to chill out?
[321:27.58]I'm chilled right now.
[321:28.82]I am chilled out.
[321:30.10]What are you talking about?
[321:32.56]I'm chilled out right now.
[321:41.23]Oh my goodness.
[322:21.41]Oh, I missed!
[322:32.69]Where?
[322:54.56]Where are you?
[322:59.50]Oh my god, these things are stupid.
[323:03.29]Where the fuck is this stupid motherfucker?
[323:05.71]He's like, oh, I'm hiding underneath a little thing over here.
[323:23.31]My webcam's gotten darker.
[323:39.36]There's a lot more left.
[324:03.55]This is bright.
[324:10.68]Ow.
[324:10.88]Okay, that hurts.
[324:13.00]If they're in sand, they won't bleed.
[324:16.99]Tell me something, Superman.
[324:18.11]Do you bleed?
[324:53.00]This is such a terrible fucking place to fight you.
[325:08.76]I feel like playing Mario 64.
[325:40.44]Oops!
[325:41.56]Sorry, that was loud.
[325:48.48]Shut up!
[325:49.83]No way!
[326:00.27]Why would I use this gun?
[326:04.52]Like, what's the point of using that?
[326:05.86]Everything else is better.
[326:23.99]How come I don't ever slide?
[326:24.93]Because using my pinky to go like this to hit control, I can't do it.
[326:31.51]I can't hit the orange button on a Guitar Hero controller either.
[326:40.10]I physically can't do it.
[327:17.20]Oh my god, what's that?
[327:20.32]What is that?
[327:23.06]What?
[327:42.23]Oh, shit.
[327:51.43]Did that miss?
[327:55.21]What the fuck are you talking about?
[327:57.02]Ugh, so many buttons!
[328:26.28]I gotta get over there and shoot him.
[328:47.15]Got it.
[328:52.71]Checkpoint?
[328:53.21]No.
[328:56.22]Yep.
[328:58.55]Which way should I go?
[328:59.17]This way?
[329:01.49]Oh, shit.
[329:01.87]Double, double, double, double, double, double, double, double.
[329:42.26]The bitrate is fucking up.
[329:44.99]Bad bitrate.
[329:51.16]Um... What do I do with this?
[330:14.27]Over here?
[330:17.31]I want to put this thing down.
[330:22.34]Oh, there it is.
[330:32.40]Now I need red.
[330:35.56]My voice is so junk right now, holy shit.
[330:39.04]Turn up the game's volume.
[330:44.66]Maybe it's probably the fucking screaming I was doing.
[330:57.13]How's that?
[330:57.47]Better?
[331:03.61]I was doing a lot of screaming, yeah.
[331:05.03]I gotta stop screaming, dude.
[331:10.68]What was that?
[331:17.91]There's something over there.
[331:19.93]That's gold?
[331:30.94]No.
[331:31.86]Can I get it from the other side?
[331:37.08]Where is it?
[331:37.38]Over there?
[331:37.68]Excuse me.
[331:39.29]I wasn't ready.
[331:43.93]I'm starting to become exhausted.
[331:45.33]I'll be honest.
[331:55.29]I can wall jump over there?
[331:56.41]Yeah.
[332:02.69]Ooh, it gives me a double?
[332:04.41]How long?
[332:05.91]I already get a double from here.
[332:09.15]You're almost done with the game?
[332:10.53]Yeah, but like, I know, I can see the end, but like, I'm so wrecked right now.
[332:17.85]My, like, brain hurts.
[332:19.85]Okay, I'm gonna go this way.
[332:23.65]Where should I go?
[332:26.64]Pick up the second double?
[332:28.02]How long does it last?
[332:28.80]I'm just gonna go over here.
[332:35.18]They stack?
[332:40.41]What the fuck?
[332:51.22]Um...
[332:57.73]Where am I?
[332:58.61]Where do I am?
[333:00.55]I'm going to... I fell off the edge.
[333:04.25]I'm dead, man.
[333:05.07]I can't even see.
[333:12.09]I would rather not have that on.
[333:23.00]I have slowed down significantly.
[333:29.20]I fell off.
[333:29.82]Yeah, man.
[333:33.81]I'm doing the equivalent of like... I don't even know what this equivalent is.
[333:36.87]I'm fucking tired.
[333:43.49]You know what?
[333:44.01]This has got to come out.
[333:46.98]Yeah, granny mode is absolutely activated right now.
[333:49.18]I'm fucking done.
[333:52.64]Take a break.
[333:53.70]No, we push on.
[333:55.52]I'm a gamer.
[334:00.74]Groggy Gary's back.
[334:14.02]He's going back in.
[334:30.24]Ah, my... Like this?
[335:20.73]Get him!
[335:27.49]Pretty big damage, yeah, oh yeah.
[335:38.16]So am I, is this, how much more do I have left?
[335:41.10]Oh, two more.
[335:46.25]That was so cool.
[335:47.39]This game is really, this game's awesome.
[336:07.70]No, that's not good.
[336:42.55]Okay.
[336:44.71]Okay.
[336:47.29]Alright.
[336:52.95]Just have to light everything up.
[337:27.83]Okay.
[337:29.33]Mhm.
[338:55.29]What?
[338:59.18]I was gonna do a joke where I picked my nose and ate it.
[339:02.40]But people would probably be grossed out by that.
[339:28.15]Let's freaking go.
[340:05.25]I don't think this is gonna work actually
[340:31.00]I did it!
[340:31.45]I actually did it.
[340:35.47]Holy shit.
[340:36.73]Okay.
[340:43.17]I like this music.
[340:43.73]This music is awesome.
[341:21.45]Oh, come on, Gwen.
[341:53.04]Okay, I got it.

[355:10.60]Freddy Fish?
[355:11.04]Oh yeah, that's right.
[355:12.92]This cam looks really weird now.
[355:16.13]This looks weird, doesn't it?
[355:20.11]It's weirdly dark in all the wrong places.
[355:24.01]Well, that was a lot of fun.
[355:24.85]That was quite a stream.
[355:26.79]Thanks for joining me.
[355:29.31]We'll figure it out.
[355:29.89]I'll be in pre-stream.
[355:30.73]You know what?
[355:31.09]We'll go for Monday.
[355:32.05]Monday at 2.
[355:32.87]I'm going to keep 2.30.
[355:34.31]2 to 2.30-ish.
[355:35.19]But I'm going to say 2, but 2.30-ish.
[355:36.89]You never know.
[355:38.23]We'll do Monday at 2 o'clock.
[355:41.74]That sounds good, I think.
[355:45.91]I got all the DreadX stuff.
[355:46.91]Maybe I'll do DreadX stuff.
[355:48.93]Either that or... I don't know.
[355:53.95]Sorry I'm so loud.
[355:57.78]I don't know.
[355:58.06]What do you guys think?
[356:09.22]We'll figure it out in pre-stream.
[356:10.74]I'll be ready.
[356:11.58]I'll be here.
[356:13.40]On Monday, I'll be around at like 1.30 or so.
[356:17.40]Do online quizzes.
[356:22.00]You promised to play Freddy Fish.
[356:25.07]Yeah, but are you guys going to actually be here for Freddy Fish or are you just telling me to play it so then you don't show up and you laugh because nobody's going to be here?
[356:38.75]We'll hit...
[356:41.29]There'll be 15,000 to 20,000 people here watching Freddy Fish.
[356:45.07]And 10,000 of you are going to be begging me to play a different game.
[356:48.47]That's how it works.
[356:50.43]You need to convince everybody that Freddy Fish is a good idea.
[356:57.28]Oh, all the demos too.
[357:00.12]Yeah, VRJosh was just saying it.
[357:04.53]They have this curation of a ton of demos on Steam right now.
[357:07.33]Maybe we should just play a bunch of demos.
[357:08.93]That might be fun.
[357:09.43]Maybe we'll do that.
[357:15.40]We'll figure it out.
[357:16.03]Should be fun.
[357:19.49]Appreciate it, though.
[357:20.07]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[357:21.53]A lot of stuff is in the works right now.
[357:24.59]I hope that by the end of the summer, we can look back and kind of be like, wow, look at all that stuff that happened.
[357:32.62]So I'm really looking forward to it.
[357:38.14]Kind of a meltdown stream today, but you know, as it happens when you play these games, it requires an intense amount of thought and focus.
[357:58.77]Yeah, there is a new BTTV Pride emote, if you want to use it.
[358:03.79]Happy Pride Month, obviously, here.
[358:09.52]Is it there?
[358:10.12]Is it show up?
[358:10.76]Yeah, I've seen it.
[358:21.96]And yeah, we'll see you guys on Monday.
[358:23.95]Monday, Monday, Monday.
[358:31.26]Check the category.
[358:32.40]Wait, is it all fucked up?
[358:38.98]Somebody at Twitch just probably sees this category getting like... There's probably some alert that they have.
[358:45.19]And they're just like, what the fuck?
[358:54.70]okay so sorry for lack of gameplay currently learning the alphabet please click on the stream I'm begging you okay well no the cbd sippy we do a little demon killing keeping the Jerma oh god

[359:32.89]Oh, that's me.

[359:46.14]Goodbye.
[359:47.38]Take care of yourselves.
[360:12.71]Holy shit, I had... There was a lot of... Freddy gave 100 community subs earlier.
[360:21.15]How long ago did this happen?
[360:24.04]There's a huge raid, too.
[360:28.28]Sorry?
[360:29.16]Sorry?
[360:29.68]Saru?
[360:29.78]Am I saying that right?
[360:32.08]Well, thanks for the raid.
[360:33.72]I missed a lot.
[360:34.26]I'm sorry, I was very much gaming.
[360:37.14]It was literally at the beginning of the stream.
[360:46.68]Sorry?
[360:47.92]Sorry?
[360:48.32]That was a big raid.
[360:53.70]I always miss shit.
[360:54.60]I'm so fucking bad at streaming.
[360:57.07]I really am.
[360:58.73]I get so locked in, I just don't even know what's happening on my own stream.
[361:10.82]Oh, before I forget.
[361:19.16]How's Otto?
[361:19.96]Otto's good.
[361:23.04]How come Bostonians say sorry weird?
[361:25.19]Sorry?
[361:26.27]Sorry.
[361:26.97]Sorry.
[361:27.19]What do you mean?
[361:28.61]It was during the tuber bit.
[361:30.01]Oh.
[361:38.68]Yeah.
[361:39.22]No, thanks.
[361:39.56]If you're still here, thanks.
[361:43.26]I sometimes have a tendency to not pay attention to anything.
[361:46.38]But what is directly in front of me?
[361:49.72]Have a great night, guys.
[361:50.44]I'll see you Monday.
[361:51.12]Good night.
