[00:04.69]I love this comment.
[00:05.41]Somebody said, LOL he's streaming the entirety of Columbo on his other channel.
[00:18.18]Why do you know what Columbo is?
[00:21.30]Why do you know what that is?
[00:29.10]Do they still play Columbo?
[00:32.59]on like TBS for eight hours a day.
[00:36.13]They still do that?
[00:42.49]I want to know what the royalties and kind of syndication rights that the Columbo producers have.
[00:50.18]Because Columbo has been, I think, syndicated on more networks than Seinfeld and Friends combined.
[01:01.52]I think there's like a 20% chance that if you change through television channels, you'll land on Columbo.
[01:10.41]It's still like that.
[01:11.53]I did not know that.
[01:13.87]How are you?
[01:14.25]Good to see you.
[01:18.43]Things are going well.
[01:19.71]Give me one sec.
[01:32.06]Oh, I thought I muted the mic.
[01:34.88]Holy shit, why did the mic not mute?
[01:37.20]That button doesn't work.
[01:40.78]I just like moved my microphone to be closer to my face and I thought I muted it.
[01:45.26]I usually do.
[01:46.68]I usually catch that, but this button doesn't work.
[01:49.36]I'm really sorry.
[01:50.11]That should not have happened.
[01:52.99]I'm doing pretty good.
[01:54.31]I'm doing good.
[01:54.69]Let me just make a tweet.
[02:02.74]Daily streamer?
[02:03.48]Somebody said, well, why are you six hours late?
[02:06.90]Um... Well... Here's the thing.
[02:14.09]Yesterday, I was supposed to stream.
[02:16.91]At... What, four o'clock yesterday?
[02:22.57]But what happened was... I ended up playing... I delayed the stream by like three or four hours.
[02:30.41]And then played with Ludwig, Charlie, and Connor.
[02:36.36]And then the stream that was supposed to happen yesterday is happening just today.
[02:39.48]I mean, whatever.
[02:41.50]Oops.
[02:42.20]Wrong Discord.
[02:42.96]Whatever.
[02:43.24]Alright.
[02:46.71]I'm tweeting.
[02:47.15]I'm tweeting.
[02:47.57]I'm tweeting.
[02:47.93]Just wait.
[02:48.21]I'm tweeting.
[02:48.61]I'm tweeting.
[03:29.10]Oops, wrong Discord.
[03:35.50]I got the ID wrong.
[03:38.81]It's whatever.
[03:41.27]Was that even that bad?
[03:43.05]Okay, the joke wasn't bad.
[03:44.57]It was the execution that was the problem.
[03:47.43]I had great joke writers yesterday.
[03:49.33]It's just I, as the actor, screwed it up, right?
[03:54.51]I'm also the writer too, so don't get mad.
[03:56.56]That was a good one.
[04:02.36]It was so bad, it was embarrassing.
[04:05.88]Was it really though?
[04:06.54]I don't think so.
[04:13.02]Is this a pre-written stream?
[04:16.07]I never told you guys this, but I have on my third monitor over here, you notice how sometimes I kind of look over and like I'm not looking over at you guys, like the chat room, I'm looking at the other monitor.
[04:25.98]I have about 6,000 to 7,000 jokes that I have written out as one sentence, kind of like little references from when I was a kid or whatever, just here.
[04:35.95]And I just look over and I pick one and I just say it.
[04:40.25]It's a really, really good tip if you're trying to stream to an audience.
[04:45.37]I have like six or seven thousand, kind of one sentence like, like when aliens show up, that kind of shit, right?
[04:52.06]That's like a sentence here.
[04:56.66]If I hit, like, control F, find D, and I type, like, Duncan, it's two or three hundred of these lines here.
[05:05.04]It's like, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan.
[05:08.34]So this, like, pretty much any scenario, I can just do it.
[05:11.02]It's kind of like a encyclopedia.
[05:12.74]You guys ready to play MS-DOS?
[05:19.77]All these cutaway gags.
[05:27.13]You should do a naked joke.
[05:31.11]Well, a naked joke turns into a band joke.
[05:37.69]I just turn on the full face cam and just, I just am naked and I just point at the camera and go, got you.
[05:43.89]And then like the not like this image shows up and my stream's just gone.
[05:49.52]That's how, is that a joke?
[06:01.17]Aha, that would be funny.
[06:05.05]It's with you guys.
[06:07.99]Alright, so we're gonna play MS-DOS.
[06:09.43]It's returning.
[06:10.31]It's been a long time since I've played it.
[06:12.65]Last MS-DOS stream, I believe, was probably like two years ago.
[06:18.31]It's been a very long time.
[06:19.62]It's been like at least a year or two.
[06:22.88]I used to do this once a week.
[06:25.62]Because there are probably a thousand plus MS-DOS pieces of software.
[06:31.47]So we're going to play.
[06:41.87]This is how we're going to do it.
[06:43.39]The first one is going to be a big fan favorite, I think.
[06:49.31]One of the most requested DOS games that I've received since saying I was going to go back to this.
[06:56.86]No, not Wolfenstein.
[06:57.98]Nope.
[07:00.26]No, we're talking about Jump Start Kindergarten.
[07:05.76]That's the... That's the one that's been requested a lot.
[07:14.17]I was told that the music in this game is the only reason to play it.
[07:18.15]So we're gonna find out what that means.
[07:22.91]Finally, a game fitting for chat.
[07:27.16]I wonder how excited, okay, this is, if you guys resident sleeper this game, I'm gonna be real pissed.
[07:33.33]I'm gonna be very unhappy if this is like, oh, dude, next, hurry up.
[07:40.40]Everybody pretend pogs until the thing that they're pretend pogging actually shows up.
[07:46.38]I've learned this over the years.
[07:55.87]I, you know, I get, I get pog lit all the time.
[07:58.50]You guys are just pog lighting me a lot.
[08:00.64]Oh my god, you didn't, no, dude, you gotta do pog, pog champ, oh my god, pog!
[08:05.00]He's gonna do it!
[08:06.30]And then I do it.
[08:08.60]This fucking sucks, dude, fucking do something else.
[08:11.14]I would rather you play Picross, dude, get the fuck out of here, fucking turn your stream off.
[08:14.30]Alright, here we go.
[08:19.43]Jumpstart Kindergarten number one is the first one we're gonna do, let's do it.
[08:23.45]You guys ready?
[08:27.49]Are you?
[08:27.79]Find out.
[08:33.25]Go, go, go to school.
[08:36.17]Go to school.
[08:39.13]Kindergarten, here I come.
[08:44.40]All right.

[08:59.21]This is crazy.
[09:15.12]I love the tuba.
[09:18.76]What about the garden?
[09:19.44]Can I go to the garden?
[09:22.05]Oh, everything is clickable.
[09:23.23]This was huge back in the fucking 40s.
[09:26.45]Everything was clickable.
[09:28.99]Yup, you didn't- Oh, Jeremy, you can't click on the tree and have oranges spawn.
[09:32.27]What are you, fucking dumb?
[09:42.43]Whoa!
[09:44.05]Whoa!
[09:47.32]I need to do these streams more often.
[09:48.70]This is really easy content.
[09:57.48]Do you guys see?
[09:58.14]Oh, they're on the swing.
[09:59.84]Hi, click on the door when you're ready to come inside.

[10:29.50]That's great.
[10:31.78]I bet you it's the same person that did every single voice in the whole game.
[10:38.77]You want to talk about, like, compassionate, passionate game devs?
[10:42.47]This is the programmer.
[10:44.53]This is the voice actor.
[10:46.09]This is the guy that made all the puzzles.
[10:50.59]One man show, truly.

[17:15.65]Alright, let's see.
[17:20.13]Oh, yeah.
[17:20.47]You have to find the piece that doesn't belong before you can color the picture.

[18:07.61]I like this.
[18:08.73]Now what?
[18:10.79]I didn't want to fucking do that.
[18:11.51]You have to find the piece that doesn't belong before you can color the picture.
[18:17.53]What doesn't belong?
[18:18.15]The dog?
[18:19.83]Fantastic!
[18:20.71]Alright, I want to color the picture.
[18:24.14]Change the picture by clicking on any piece.
[18:27.79]When you like the picture, select a color and start filling it in.
[18:32.13]That was like somebody- that was like someone put- got their hand in a mouse trap.
[18:36.65]And they held it up to the camera screaming and their eyes were like looking directly into the camera.
[18:42.70]Alright, how about uh... Dark green.

[18:59.48]Please don't do it.
[19:00.34]Don't do it.
[19:00.80]It's gonna get clipped forever.
[19:01.70]I don't know.

[21:04.27]Do you want to save this picture?
[21:05.97]No!
[21:09.43]What else can I do?
[21:10.39]Can I watch a TV show?
[21:11.73]Does it do the whole alphabet?

[23:12.04]J for... Jump.
[23:16.22]No, that's like a verb.
[23:17.48]These are all gonna be nouns.
[23:18.54]What would J be?
[23:19.98]Jump.
[23:21.06]Jump.
[23:21.84]J is gonna be kite.
[23:39.49]K is gonna be kite.
[23:43.51]Yes, of course it is.
[23:44.93]Here we go.
[23:47.07]I have to get a passing grade on this.
[23:49.91]Otherwise I fail the fucking first grade.
[23:56.28]L for... Lion.
[23:59.86]WHAT?!

[35:43.36]I don't know.
[35:43.74]I...

[37:43.91]Roses and cabbage.
[37:45.35]It's kind of a weird group of animals.
[37:49.12]Flowers.
[37:49.56]You'll have to hurry, though.
[37:50.98]That gopher loves to eat my plants.
[37:53.72]I need six heads of lettuce.
[37:58.36]Ready, set, go.
[37:59.48]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

[38:50.19]Oh no, the golfer ate up my garden.
[39:03.19]Oh, they're in your bag.
[39:04.75]Stupid.
[39:07.51]What's the watering game?
[39:09.03]I like to make patterns.
[39:11.28]See if you can guess the pattern of plants in my garden.
[39:22.58]Pattern?
[39:23.46]What do you mean pattern?
[39:26.29]This is a bad idea.
[39:28.37]Can you guess what I planted here?
[39:30.27]Your carrots are gonna cannibalize the roots of your cabbage.
[39:33.86]MONSTER!
[39:34.40]What do you mean, pattern?
[39:39.94]Uh-oh!
[39:41.50]Here comes the gopher!
[39:45.51]Wait, oh, you just have to do, alright.
[39:47.55]I thought I was supposed to guess what his, whatever.

[40:04.56]Can you guess what I planted here?
[40:10.58]Can you guess what I planted here?
[40:11.96]Can you guess what I planted here?
[40:13.70]Can you guess what I planted here?
[40:16.12]Can you guess what I planted here?
[40:32.61]Oh, sunflowers.
[40:33.31]Two sunflowers.
[40:39.77]Alright.
[40:40.92]Alright, bro.
[40:42.68]Uh, yeah.
[40:43.20]One of these.
[40:43.76]Alright.
[40:44.14]It's been 30 minutes.
[40:45.56]Oh my god, this is boring.
[40:59.56]I'm having fun, okay?
[41:01.86]I'm having a good time.
[41:02.94]Is there anything else I can do outside?
[41:10.95]Oh, yeah.
[41:19.39]This is fucking weird.
[41:21.82]I have a camera?
[41:22.96]No, I want to do the picnic.
[41:23.80]Alright, what, we got cookies?
[41:30.46]Watch out!
[41:34.03]There's so many wild animals.
[41:43.33]You're easily entertained.
[41:44.41]It's from like 1980, it's fun.
[41:48.73]Alright, we're moving on.
[41:50.79]It's been 40 minutes, you're right.
[41:52.25]Okay.
[41:52.73]I have had a great time in this one, but we're gonna move on.
[41:54.71]Okay, fine.
[41:55.33]Fine.
[41:58.45]You're really gonna be not happy about the second one.
[42:00.63]Those of you that were not happy about that first one, you're really gonna not be happy about the second one.
[42:05.73]In a similar way.
[42:06.63]I will not spend 40 minutes in this one, I promise.
[42:09.60]I promise.
[42:09.98]It's Dinosaur Adventure.
[42:19.93]Rate them out of 10?
[42:20.45]Okay.
[42:20.75]What do I do?
[42:34.44]So what?
[42:37.20]What do I do?
[42:48.47]Click here to read a dinosaur storybook.
[42:51.35]Play the Name-a-saurus game.
[42:53.59]Play the Read-a-saurus game.
[42:56.35]Explore the world of dinosaurs, or click to see movies about dinosaurs.
[43:00.52]I think we're gonna see the movies.
[43:21.16]Where the fuck is this footage from?
[43:22.78]Is this from a theme park or something?
[43:28.76]This is weird.
[43:29.48]That's it?
[43:32.14]This would scare the shit out of me when I was a kid, because this is real.
[43:44.71]Where is this from?
[43:56.86]animatronic animals especially animatronic dinosaurs are terrifying even to this day to this day going on that was that that like jurassic park ride with the t-rex where you go down and the t-rex's huge animatronic head is just right there
[44:16.23]There's something so unsettling about that.
[44:18.61]Even in my thirties.
[44:19.79]I just don't like it.
[44:21.35]I do not like it.
[44:37.55]I'm very curious where this footage is from.
[44:50.24]Is that what a Tyrannosaurus sounds like?
[44:53.22]Tyrannosaurus.
[44:56.38]Ah, repeat, we've already seen it.
[44:59.78]Alright, what are the other activities?
[45:01.81]These are not animatronics.
[45:07.19]What the hell are they then?
[45:07.99]What are you talking about?
[45:08.59]Alright, how about I read a dinosaur storybook?
[45:11.13]Long, long ago, animals called dinosaurs lived on the earth.
[45:20.08]There were big ones.
[45:24.63]And small ones.
[45:30.05]There were wet ones.
[45:34.02]And dry ones.
[45:38.38]Some flew in the sky.
[45:45.60]This is like somebody's backyard.
[45:47.04]This is like pine trees back here.
[45:49.00]This is somebody's backyard.
[45:51.22]That, these, I don't, were these, these what didn't exist?
[45:54.46]Did like a regular ass pine tree exist like a hundred million years ago?
[46:01.89]And some walked on the ground.
[46:09.03]Some ate plants.
[46:11.56]Grass didn't exist?
[46:12.43]No, but I mean like a regular, like, backyard pine tree.
[46:18.37]Did they ex- I don't think they existed.
[46:20.55]It was like weird alien stuff.
[46:22.11]Like, it was big, like, tropical plants.
[46:25.32]But did they exist?
[46:28.02]They have, like, the huge leaves.
[46:35.20]All the Jurassic plants were like gigantic lettuce leaves.
[46:39.24]I don't think they were just like maple trees hanging out.
[46:43.89]Where did they all come from?
[46:46.11]From mother and father dinosaurs, of course.
[46:51.41]Where did they go?
[46:51.97]Well, we don't know.
[46:54.31]But some people think comets killed them all.
[47:04.49]And now all that's left is bones.
[47:07.85]Oh, like, sad.
[47:11.31]What a way to end the presentation.
[47:13.17]Alright, Namosaurus.
[47:15.99]Find the Brontosaurus.
[47:17.99]Easy.
[47:18.47]Brontosaurus, long neck.
[47:19.57]Keep looking.
[47:21.95]This is the Brachiosaurus.
[47:27.24]You're right.
[47:28.34]You found the Brontosaurus.
[47:30.28]That's bullshit, because you didn't see the whole body.
[47:31.96]Find the Tyrannosaurus.
[47:34.43]Tyrannosaurus is this one.
[47:35.83]This is T-Rex.
[47:37.49]That one.
[47:37.99]Way too dank.
[47:38.39]I'll turn it down.
[47:39.98]I don't want to find any of these anymore.
[47:44.16]Alright, hold on.
[47:45.48]What about this one?
[48:03.78]Oh, shit!
[48:04.88]Okay, that hurts my head.
[48:06.04]Hold on a second.
[48:10.91]That's better.
[48:13.13]Okay.
[48:14.65]So, this one we have to... We can go pretty much anywhere we want.
[48:18.77]2,000 miles... Wait.
[48:20.83]Alright, let's see if there's any pine trees.
[48:22.67]100 million years ago?
[48:25.36]What was, like, a million years ago?
[48:35.44]Million BC.
[48:36.14]What about, like, do they have, like, what do we know was here?
[48:38.98]2000?
[48:39.00]1922 to 1925.
[48:40.12]And we'll do 100 million miles or something.
[48:47.54]100 miles.
[48:47.70]Ugh!
[49:04.79]Pine tree lore.
[49:05.91]Yeah, we gotta find out where the first pine tree was planted.
[49:07.69]There you go.
[49:13.90]100 million BC.
[49:21.42]Is that a pine tree?
[49:22.62]Pine tree is some of the earliest versions of trees.
[49:29.08]Pine trees came before...
[49:31.80]Doesn't that seem odd though?
[49:32.98]Like I can't imagine... Like a Tyrannosaurus Rex just walking around a bunch of pine trees.
[49:38.46]That feels weird, doesn't it?
[49:45.16]Don't you like imagine just like a... like a... a... baseball diamond near them too?
[49:50.21]Like at some old like town park?
[49:58.55]Like, this feels like a weird image.
[50:00.03]Like, this is just... Oh, yeah, they're just flying around, like, back there.
[50:03.67]American education.
[50:12.44]Pine trees were the first types of... No, it's not... It's not N.A.
[50:19.58]education.
[50:20.81]It's N.A.
[50:21.59]education, and then 20 years to forget everything!
[50:26.70]It's NA education, and then on top of that, whoa, 20 years have gone by.
[50:34.61]So I don't know that a pine tree existed.
[50:36.31]When was the first bug, is what I want to know.
[50:40.61]What was the first bug?
[50:46.81]Holy shit.
[50:51.63]Life, how did it happen?
[50:54.11]Okay.
[50:56.02]In this illustration, you can follow what might be the history of life on Earth.
[51:00.25]In the sky, you see the development of galaxies similar to the Milky Way.
[51:04.15]There are the comets, planets, and moons that formed in the solar system.
[51:08.08]And the rays of our star, the Sun, send us the energy that life depends on.
[51:14.88]In the ocean, at the far left, the molecules that were the original building blocks of life are forming.
[51:20.48]As you look to the right, you can see the bacteria that were the first cells of life, followed by more sophisticated sea life.
[51:27.07]Amphibians were able to... How do they know this?
[51:30.31]How do you fucking know any of this is real?
[51:32.33]How do they know any of this?
[51:33.43]You weren't there 150 billion years ago.
[51:35.37]How do you know this?
[51:41.22]This is the story about what fossils show us.
[51:43.72]How do you know that?
[51:45.20]Hmm?
[51:46.06]What's oxygen?
[51:47.18]Huh?
[51:47.50]What's oxygen?
[51:48.04]What is it?
[51:49.47]What is oxygen?
[51:50.13]What is it?
[51:51.83]Oh, it's molecules.
[51:52.45]What's a molecule?
[51:56.33]See?
[51:57.33]Got him.
[52:03.31]Somebody said, bro, I was there.
[52:04.69]I know.
[52:10.77]That is not a, okay, I'm, who is this?
[52:18.44]Oh, it's Charles Darwin.
[52:22.20]I've been playing way too many FromSoftware games.
[52:25.73]This just like, looks like all the statues in all the games.
[52:37.16]Uh, yeah, like, 200, 250 years ago.

[80:35.65]What have... I can't delete this.
[80:39.07]Pantry.
[80:41.59]A cannibals meal.
[80:42.92]What does that mean?
[80:43.64]Diet.
[80:47.68]Food.
[80:49.92]Things in a pot.
[80:57.28]What is cannibals?
[81:03.62]Hearts of the heart.
[81:13.69]These things are... Bugs.
[81:19.11]Animals.
[81:29.15]Oh well.
[81:41.82]That was the $100,000 pyramid.
[81:47.46]Up next is a game called, uh, CEO.
[81:58.85]This is a full motion video game.
[82:02.70]It has lots of full motion cutscenes.
[82:10.16]I have no idea what to expect.
[82:11.24]All I know is it exists.
[82:14.16]I think you have to like buy and sell companies.
[82:16.42]Let's see.
[82:21.20]How do you find these old games?
[82:22.80]There are a ton, a ton of these on archive.org.
[82:32.73]It's like thousands of them.
[82:39.22]Okay.
[82:40.32]It's just loading.
[82:41.50]Give me one sec.
[82:47.15]No one said that.
[82:51.59]Live action FME cutscenes are in them.
[82:53.35]Oh, yeah.
[82:56.21]Almost ready.
[82:57.33]Just loading up.
[83:01.19]The good ones are on GOG.
[83:02.51]The bad ones are on Archive.org.
[83:08.12]Ah, we've seen some really good ones on Archive.org.
[83:14.90]Need to lower the timer to get through more of these.
[83:17.64]Ah, I don't really have a time limit.
[83:18.72]I'm just messing around.
[83:20.47]Alright.
[83:22.25]This one's big.
[83:22.99]Damn, this one's like 400 megabytes.
[83:27.43]Were games that big back then?
[83:29.63]When did this come out?
[83:35.62]400 megabytes.
[83:36.40]1995.
[83:36.60]That seems huge for 1995.
[83:39.56]That's massive.
[83:49.15]3D Movie Maker came out in 1995, and I don't think that was more than... That was a big one, too.
[83:53.35]I think that was like 100 megabytes.
[83:56.47]Maybe less.
[83:56.87]Diablo 2 was 1 gig.
[84:01.62]It really was.
[84:02.18]Alright, here we go.
[84:09.99]What's my laundry routine?
[84:12.65]I fill the bathtub with water, just throw all the dirty clothes in there, and just take a gigantic spoon and just like... And then I take it all out and put it outside and lay it on the ground in individual pieces and it dries in like a day or so.
[84:41.75]Can I unask that question?
[84:43.23]No.
[84:43.99]You can't.
[84:46.65]Damn, this is a big game.
[84:49.78]That's poorly optimized.
[84:56.58]92%.
[84:57.50]How's my day?
[84:57.92]It's going good.
[85:03.24]You look really Jerma-esque today.
[85:06.30]Didn't somebody say my nose was like a pickle yesterday?
[85:12.21]I can- I can see it.
[85:12.95]Alright, here we go.
[85:13.41]You ready?
[85:15.43]Let's go.
[85:40.61]Okay.
[85:49.43]This looks, uh, in partnership with CNN.
[85:52.06]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[85:55.40]I gotta turn it up.
[85:55.92]This is in partnership with CNN.
[86:02.30]I gotta, we gotta get this right.
[86:03.60]Okay.
[86:07.20]Okay, name.
[86:12.60]Me.
[86:13.32]Me.
[86:15.14]Me.
[86:17.46]Uh, me.
[86:19.34]Uh, me.
[86:19.70]Okay.
[86:23.48]Mr. Me.
[86:26.88]Host has accepted your logon.
[86:28.92]AIV group access.
[86:30.36]Corporate mandate simulation.
[86:36.74]Video messages waiting.
[86:38.66]Two.
[86:40.28]Wait, imagine how fucking annoying this would be.
[86:46.41]Okay, play messages.
[86:48.49]Beginning transmission in three, two, one.
[86:55.89]You have one new voicemail.
[87:00.13]CNN on the line.
[87:01.49]Alright, CNN left me a voicemail?
[87:04.57]I'm Catherine Sparks at the CNN Center in Atlanta.
[87:08.11]Welcome to CNN Online.
[87:10.57]A plane crash near Sarajevo may have killed Dwight Owen Barnes, the hard-driving CEO of the A4 Group.
[87:18.16]Stock markets in Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo reacted to the news by driving down the value of A4 stock.
[87:26.38]Trading of A4 shares was halted in London and Paris overnight as prices declined 18% in a matter of hours.
[87:35.41]Transacting business on a worldwide scale.
[87:38.58]A4 has risen from humbling... Classified documents.
[87:42.18]Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Rome, London.
[87:44.54]...dominating such diverse fields as silicon chip manufacturing, telecommunications, and agrotechnology.
[87:53.01]I don't think you'd want to put those on your desktop.
[87:55.27]...on the phone from Batola.
[87:56.59]Hello, Steve.
[87:58.39]In 1974, Katsuo Murata, the Japanese president of the A4 group, disappeared from his private yacht in the seas off Bermuda.
[88:05.97]This evening, his successor, Dwight Owen Barnes, is still missing.
[88:10.47]His plane made its last contact with the Tirana control tower at about 8 o'clock last night while flying over the town of Titovo, 50 kilometers from the Serbian border.
[88:19.59]The Skopje government says it has no information about the disappearance of the businessman's jet and has sent several rescue teams to the area.
[88:27.50]The extreme tension in the Balkans, together with the bad weather conditions which have hit this mountain area for the last week, is making the search extremely difficult.
[88:35.66]I want to see what's in these classified files.
[88:37.34]...at first light.
[88:40.73]Okay.
[88:41.77]Nearly 25 years ago, Dwight Owen Barnes grasped control of the then modest $10 billion A4 group, turning it into today's $100 billion multinational conglomerate.
[88:55.04]What do we do?
[88:55.56]Barnes' disappearance creates a vacuum in the executive ranks of one of the world's largest and most visible companies.
[89:01.80]What do we sell?
[89:03.39]Three former CEOs have also departed in an equally abrupt and mysterious fashion.
[89:09.16]Perhaps even more uncommon is the fact that within a short period, a new CEO has been named to head A4, a complete unknown from outside the organization or from any other known corporate entity for that matter.
[89:23.74]Then, A4 usually follows a series of management reversals, resulting in international market shifts of global proportions, out of which the company has grown several fold.
[89:36.03]Who am I?
[89:36.39]CNN will monitor world financial markets and provide updates as more information becomes available.
[89:41.56]Why do I have access to this guy's computer?
[89:42.92]Thank you for watching via CNN online.
[89:47.20]Video message is waiting.
[89:48.56]There is still one.
[89:50.39]Here it comes.
[89:53.85]Starts playing Cartoon Network.
[90:00.93]It just goes like Teen Titans.
[90:04.55]I'm going to get another call, another video.
[90:09.55]You would like to sit in the chair of power.
[90:12.89]Well, I'm going to give you that chance.
[90:16.95]It's fucking like the Jimmy Fallon set.
[90:18.69]The world has learned of my absence.
[90:22.77]and may soon learn of my successor.
[90:27.95]It amuses me to hear the pundits speculating about the circumstances of our succession policy.
[90:36.11]Get some better lighting, you.
[90:37.37]Fucking office sucks.
[90:39.71]At A4, we trust in the element of surprise.
[90:43.39]Imagine any other company stepping outside their cozy network of corporate sycophants and placing a rank amateur at the top.
[90:50.83]So your plane didn't crash.
[90:52.96]A4's dividend from such timid corporate myopia is the factor of complete predictability.
[90:59.34]You see, by the time our competitors' clones route their way to the front of the trough, we can anticipate their every move.
[91:07.77]We know every corporate report they've ever published guru they've ever quoted and everyone they've ever stepped.
[91:15.33]You see, we got my son's math homework book and we're going to try to find out what, how to do long division today.
[91:22.73]That's like a little, that's like a eighth grade notebook with fresh raw talent and individual who possesses genetic instinct and vision to shock the competition.
[91:32.75]That's how we stay on the cutting edge.
[91:35.83]So what am I supposed to do?
[91:40.65]25 years ago, I was that individual.
[91:43.79]He set this camera up.
[91:45.49]He's here alone.
[91:46.51]Even I may have become too predictable.
[91:49.57]So we've devised a test.
[91:50.69]How many takes do you think it took?
[91:53.73]I'm just waiting for like a fuck.
[91:55.13]To address our challenge.
[91:56.93]Fuck.
[91:57.58]Three, two, one.
[92:00.96]The simulation.
[92:02.26]He's probably fucked up a thousand times.
[92:03.88]You're ready to sit in this chair.
[92:07.12]I will hand you the reins with my blessing.
[92:11.24]As for my mysterious disappearance, a classic red herring and a bit of coincidental timing, I find myself in a position... Where's he going to go?
[92:22.00]I must drive down the value of A4.
[92:26.50]One of our best hackers recently uncovered a shark in the water in the form of the head of our agrogenetics operation.
[92:34.31]He and his confederates have been... This tiny laptop.
[92:37.33]...into offshore holding companies.
[92:39.59]to cloak the fact that they've been amassing shares of A4 in preparations for an unfriendly takeover.
[92:46.13]That laptop is built into the desk.
[92:47.31]They had brokered a deal with the Eurobank group, using these shares as collateral to fund a final blitz, which would bring them... Dude, I'm getting up and getting a coffee in the middle of this.
[92:55.09]This is... I can't... Only two days to go.
[92:58.15]The answer...
[92:59.50]A poison pill.
[93:00.84]I disappear, the stock plummets, Euro sleaze calls in the loan.
[93:04.69]Our raiders are seriously deluded, in deep for misappropriations, owing an insurmountable debt to Eurobank.
[93:12.13]I can fast forward?
[93:12.93]Before they realize it, they'll be composing their memoirs in IRS on just who owns all of those offshore operations.
[93:21.14]Scorched earth, preemptive, creative, fatal.
[93:24.12]Would you have thought of it?
[93:26.64]This was just one of the easier ones.
[93:29.81]Welcome to the game.
[93:30.77]All right, what do I have to do?
[93:32.98]Okay.
[93:34.82]Entering simulation.
[93:36.04]Please wait.
[93:37.62]Okay.
[93:42.40]No, I'm waiting for, like, he didn't press the end recording button.
[93:45.46]He's sitting there burping.
[93:47.76]He's going to be sitting there like, welcome to the game.
[93:50.37]Okay, that was a good one.
[94:14.95]The like, I'm burping, but I don't want anyone to know I'm burping.
[94:18.29]The like, I fucking hate that, by the way.
[94:22.45]Alright, new game.
[94:31.30]Where are we going to want to go?
[94:32.56]How about right, how about Seattle?
[94:38.60]What am I supposed to do?
[94:45.17]No, not... No, what is it?
[94:49.34]What's in it?
[94:54.56]No, I haven't seen the paper.
[94:55.76]What do you want?
[95:00.87]Who will replace Dwight Owen Barnes?
[95:05.25]A question on everybody's mind.
[95:08.29]It's gonna be me.
[95:49.42]Our office is open at 9 a.m.
[95:51.76]Okay.
[95:52.12]Alright, what about the bank?
[95:58.57]Our office is open at 9 a.m.
[96:00.55]What time is it right now?
[96:06.57]I have 83 million dollars in debt?
[96:09.69]How am I supposed to do anything?
[96:10.57]Bro, this game is fucked up.
[96:15.33]Turn the megahertz up.
[96:16.31]Our experts predict a rise in share prices on the stock market.
[96:22.19]Alright, stock market.
[96:28.19]We're going all in.
[96:39.50]Okay, I want... This game is not happy with this setup.
[96:46.24]So wait, I want to buy... Big building?
[96:58.05]Nintendo?
[96:59.85]Did we buy Nintendo?
[97:07.31]Okay, how much does this cost?
[97:13.69]I'm just gonna buy, I'm gonna buy $83 million in Nintendo.
[97:21.61]It's based on my clicks, by the way, is how the game is running.
[97:25.25]Okay.
[97:50.95]Wait, what's happening?
[97:54.71]What's going on?
[97:56.33]Why was it doing that?
[97:57.25]Oh.
[97:57.37]Alright, I want... I want 10 million.
[98:08.05]Okay, I want... Over again.
[98:16.89]I can only do 99,000 shares.
[98:21.05]We're only being offered 1,700 shares.
[98:24.85]I won 99,000.
[98:27.77]What?
[98:35.40]What the fuck?
[98:39.98]Alright, buy this one then.
[98:43.58]Unfortunately, this stock is no longer available for purchase.
[98:48.95]Okay, how about a cola soda?
[98:50.69]Why can I only buy like 2,000 shares?
[98:57.28]I'm out of here.
[98:57.88]I'm out.
[98:58.12]I'm fucking out of here.
[98:59.10]I don't even know how to leave.
[99:21.87]How do I get out of here?
[99:24.86]Get Compaq.
[99:25.78]It's a long-term investment.
[99:28.10]I'm bailing, I'm bailing, I'm bailing, I'm bailing.
[99:29.74]Okay.
[99:37.34]As you see, I faked my own death so I could play porn music at you while you bought a thousand shares of these companies that don't exist.
[99:46.28]Like, what the fuck was that?
[99:50.29]Okay, how about, here's the next one.
[99:52.12]I think this is going to be popular.
[99:57.56]This is going to be a popular one.
[99:58.58]Are you ready?
[99:59.00]Oh!
[100:11.51]I just microwaved my brain with that sound.
[100:17.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright, turn it down.
[100:20.13]Alright, Tony and Friends in Kellogg's Land.
[100:30.51]Alright, can I name all these people?
[100:36.81]Tony the Tiger.
[100:37.41]Toucan Sam.
[100:40.17]The Smackums Frog.
[100:42.91]Um... Poco?
[100:48.25]Who's this?
[100:48.79]Who's this?
[100:54.62]I thought these two... Aren't these competing brands?
[100:57.82]They have the same cereal.
[100:58.78]I don't know who that is.
[101:09.85]Alright, Tony and Friends in Kellogg's Land.
[101:12.53]How do you start the game?
[101:15.06]Three games?
[101:15.84]Only three free games?
[101:43.38]Okay.
[101:48.28]Oh shit, let's go.
[101:55.83]This is explaining the controls.
[101:59.15]Anybody know German?
[102:03.53]How do I- what does this say?
[102:10.73]Read it out loud.
[102:12.91]Whatever, just walk and collect the delicious, crunchy, sweet cornflakes.
[102:20.82]Wow.
[102:20.98]I got a hidden block.
[102:42.80]You were just speaking simlish.
[102:49.22]Oh, there's vitamin B1!
[102:53.40]There are kaizo blocks.
[102:57.08]How far does that go?
[102:57.70]Can I jump on this thing's head, whatever this is?
[103:13.03]Is there a sprint?
[103:16.79]This is actually kind of fun.
[103:19.53]So what are the bad guys in this game?
[103:21.83]What is like a bad... What is like an anti-cereal?
[103:25.34]Bugs?
[103:27.72]Bugs love cereal, don't they?
[103:31.82]What's that?
[103:38.66]I wonder what the bosses are.
[103:41.55]I don't know.
[103:47.81]How much health do I have?
[103:48.43]Alright, I'm good.
[103:50.23]They don't pay for the cereal.
[103:51.57]Vitamin A. Those are vitamins, right?
[103:55.10]They have to be.
[103:55.42]Can I go to the house?
[104:02.38]Come on, I can do it.
[104:03.47]I'm known for this.
[104:21.94]Ah, you can't go in the house.
[104:22.66]Do I play as the other characters?
[104:24.18]Vitamin BB?
[104:33.63]Oh, I just got something.
[104:34.27]Whatever that was.
[104:37.17]This is actually pretty fun.
[104:38.07]Nice.
[104:47.27]How do I leave?
[104:49.11]Enter?
[104:51.55]Control.
[104:52.17]Alt.
[104:57.39]Mario walked so the tiger could run.
[105:03.64]Alright, I got vitamins.
[105:11.36]I want to know what the big alligator is.
[105:12.68]There's like dragons and shit in this game.
[105:17.15]Do I play only as Tony?
[105:20.72]Hold on a minute.
[105:22.32]I'll try.
[105:22.62]Give me one sec.
[105:26.36]One second.
[105:27.66]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[105:28.66]Okay.
[105:35.45]Just give me one second.
[105:38.87]Let's see if I can pull this off.
[105:42.98]There.
[105:44.30]There.
[105:44.70]Great!
[105:48.05]Everyone knows that a healthy breakfast lets you play soccer in every commercial.
[105:52.13]They're great!
[105:53.19]That was pretty good.
[106:05.48]That was good.
[106:08.40]He's in my room?
[106:13.28]Ah yeah, that was good.
[106:14.66]What's wrong with that one?
[106:16.18]I'm available.
[106:21.74]Hercule the tiger.
[106:22.74]There, great!
[106:28.94]Goku?
[106:30.06]What is that spike?
[106:32.91]I landed on that spike.
[106:44.50]Do the Gideon-Ofnir thing, but the cereal mascots.
[106:47.66]Did I just get hurt by the milk?
[106:52.37]Oh, I'm invincible.
[106:53.05]Hold on.
[106:54.81]I'm Tony the Tiger.
[107:02.52]The all-knowing.
[107:07.85]You have a clone of you that does all the multi- wait a minute, that person, what are you asking?
[107:11.57]You have a clone of you that does all the multiplayer streams, you alone versus you with other streamers is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[107:19.85]I don't know, okay.
[107:20.97]Let me ask you a question.
[107:24.59]When you, like, go over your
[107:37.70]If you're known to, like, sing, if you're a singer, are you going to greet your friend's dad by being like, Hello, Mr. Stevenson, how are you today?
[107:47.81]He'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?
[107:55.85]Why would that happen?
[107:58.33]I act differently in front of different, like, groups.
[108:02.57]I can be a weirdo in my own house, but not in other people's houses.
[108:14.69]First analogy, but I understand.
[108:15.93]No, you get it though, right?
[108:17.97]If I'm like a weirdo in my own house, if I repeat the Thanos lines over and over again... Is this my house?
[108:26.98]I'm not going to go repeat the Thanos lines at my friend's house.
[108:34.79]New character, by the way.
[108:36.39]Can you jump higher?
[108:42.31]The difference is your friends know you're weird.
[108:43.91]I don't want to take over somebody's stream.
[108:52.38]You know how annoying I would be?
[108:54.10]Am I dead by fall?
[108:59.56]This is water.
[109:00.20]I don't know.
[109:08.44]Sometimes I act a little weird.
[109:13.03]I don't want to sit there and play a trumpet while we're playing with four or five people.
[109:18.81]Eventually someone's like, hey, can somebody shut the fucking trumpet off?
[109:21.29]Because it's all I hear.
[109:30.94]How do I get up there?
[109:31.66]Wait.
[109:36.84]I'm in the wrong Discord.
[109:37.95]Yeah.
[109:39.23]Yeah, oh yeah.
[109:41.07]Mm-hmm.
[109:42.57]You want me to do that?
[109:43.15]You want to do more of that?
[109:44.88]Okay, it's thrown out.
[109:51.66]Ooh, vitamin C. You did push the Discord joke pretty hard.
[109:57.66]Yeah, I know.
[110:06.31]Oh, fuck.
[110:09.95]Is Tony immune to spikes?
[110:11.39]I don't understand.
[110:13.46]You almost got thrown out last night.
[110:17.06]I can't be either of the other two.
[110:17.90]Why not?
[110:19.82]Okay, Tony is not immune to spikes.
[110:25.01]I don't get it.
[110:26.03]I can't be the other two.
[110:31.07]No one's immune to the spikes.
[110:37.50]How do I do this?
[110:40.56]You have to use Tony's thumb.
[110:43.72]I don't understand.
[110:56.44]I'm kind of stuck down here.
[110:57.52]He loses his...
[111:10.84]I think I have to jump over it.
[111:17.22]Whatever.
[111:17.54]Alright, I want to... One more.
[111:42.43]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[111:44.53]Get outta here.
[111:48.93]Milk is invincibility!
[111:49.75]Right, go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go!
[111:51.01]Hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry!
[111:51.95]I'm invincible right now.
[111:55.54]Do I have to walk across while I'm invincible?
[111:58.40]No, no way.
[111:59.02]I don't think this is possible.
[112:04.60]This guy sucks at this dogshit game.
[112:09.73]Sorry.
[112:17.20]Alright, from here, I think I have to go up and around.
[112:19.64]That's the only way.
[112:23.75]This confirms you're a furry.
[112:27.21]What are you talking about, man?
[112:32.06]These are serial characters.
[112:33.70]Are serial characters furries?
[112:39.42]Yeah, right?
[112:40.06]A serial character is a furry?
[112:45.83]Fuck!
[112:46.83]Whatever, I can just damage boost it.
[112:53.44]Yes, they're talking animals.
[112:54.98]We're not going to have the argument again about what is a furry and what isn't a furry.
[113:00.34]A werewolf is not a furry.
[113:02.76]We already went over that, and I will defend it.
[113:06.06]I will defend it forever.
[113:11.14]No, it is not.
[113:11.92]A werewolf is not a furry.
[113:19.88]No, it's not.
[113:20.40]No, it's not.
[113:20.88]It's not.
[113:22.46]Animals, okay.
[113:24.66]Standing on animals that have human characteristics is a furry.
[113:32.08]Okay?
[113:32.62]Snack'em Sam, whatever this guy's name is, wearing a baseball cap and eating, standing upright and talks.
[113:37.79]That's a furry.
[113:39.23]A werewolf that, like, doesn't have fucking college class, that is, like, just a snarling beast that turns into this and is on all fours, that is not a furry.
[113:50.49]That's a werewolf.
[113:52.61]It's not a furry.
[113:54.55]It's not furry adjacent.
[113:55.57]No, it's not.
[113:55.99]It's an animal.
[113:56.73]It's a beast.
[113:59.99]No, it's not a furry.
[114:00.97]It's a beast.
[114:02.09]It's a beast.
[114:03.09]Not a furry.
[114:07.72]Like, if you... Okay, if my werewolf character were to stand up on two feet and have glasses and like a school notebook and go in like this.
[114:19.02]Alright, now I'm a furry.
[114:23.97]But if I'm on all fours, with like, and I'm an animal, and I don't have like a suit on.
[114:30.33]I'm a beast.
[114:33.36]I'm not a furry.
[114:34.06]I wonder which way I gotta go.
[114:45.84]Oh, maybe this way.
[114:47.08]Okay.
[114:49.86]There's a key over there.
[114:54.99]That's not a weak argument.
[114:56.09]No, it's not.
[115:00.14]If I look outside and there's a moon out there, and I am a human, and it's like, oh, not the moon!
[115:08.30]And I go off camera, and I come up, and I've got claws, and I'm, like, snarling.
[115:13.62]That's not, like, I'm not a fart.
[115:21.13]This is a Tony the Tiger Omega coin, by the way.
[115:31.25]Okay.
[115:33.36]Let's go over it.
[115:34.92]One more time.
[115:36.34]One final time and that's it.
[115:40.44]On all fours.
[115:42.12]Snarling.
[115:43.64]Beast.
[115:44.88]Upright with a cigarette.
[115:46.79]Furry.
[115:56.91]You get it?
[116:06.92]Good.
[116:11.30]That sounds like furry justification to me.
[116:13.71]Who cares?
[116:14.37]Somebody said, I do.
[116:29.88]I got a question for you.
[116:31.64]Two very important questions.
[116:35.46]This is tricky.
[116:38.44]Is Tom from Tom and Jerry a furry or a cat?
[116:49.71]Good luck with that one.
[117:01.84]Okay, alright.
[117:03.79]Is the dog that talks like this in all those cartoons the one that's always looking after Jerry?
[117:10.55]Is that a furry or is that a dog that can talk?
[117:12.97]Is Spongebob a furry?
[117:37.22]I don't know, man, I don't know.
[117:46.27]Not enough human characteristics, okay.
[117:49.97]So Garfield's not a furry.
[117:51.91]Garfield, Tom, Jerry, excuse me, that means, hold on, does that mean that Toucan Sam is not a furry?
[118:02.78]Which one of these is a furry?
[118:04.92]Because this is just a, this is a bird.
[118:06.65]This is a toucan.
[118:09.27]This is a frog with a baseball hat on.
[118:13.57]Right?
[118:14.03]I'm, this is interesting.
[118:20.31]They're standing upright.
[118:21.58]Toucans stand upright.
[118:27.42]Interesting.
[118:33.84]and he's not wearing clothes but he is he's not wearing clothes he is the levels are getting harder by the way tony's wearing a scarf
[119:04.89]How do we unlock the other two characters?
[119:06.33]This is bullshit.
[119:07.01]Oh my god.
[119:14.02]No, Tony's not a furry.
[119:20.60]He's a nudist.
[119:22.61]He's an animal.
[119:29.03]Ooh, look at that.
[119:45.74]I don't know why I'm so into this one.
[119:46.96]It's just like kind of easy and basic and fun.
[119:48.62]I want to see a boss though.
[119:58.11]Whoa, okay, you bounce on the clouds.
[119:59.29]This game sucks eggs.
[120:05.93]You bounce on the clouds.
[120:09.37]Oh shit.
[120:11.69]What the fuck is going on here?
[120:24.42]Yeah, next game.
[120:25.18]That was stupid.
[120:26.36]Next game.
[120:26.82]I'm done.
[120:29.40]I'm done.
[120:33.85]Next game.
[120:34.61]That's it.
[120:45.27]That's it.
[120:45.89]Next one.
[120:48.11]Okay, this one's called Strawberry Magic.
[120:57.96]What are you saying?
[121:01.44]Dude, your niece is watching.
[121:02.61]My niece is not watching.

[121:16.50]Maybe I'll load this in the background and we'll play something else.
[121:22.22]How come you're not playing Lego Star Wars?
[121:23.70]Um, I don't know.
[121:27.35]Alright, how about Jeopardy?

[122:32.04]The underground part of the plant that supports and holds it in its soil.
[122:36.39]The roots.
[122:39.37]What the fuck are you talking about?
[122:40.55]I don't get to guess?
[122:43.47]What are... the roots?
[122:47.77]What the fuck?
[122:49.17]That's bullshit.
[122:57.06]I have to buzz in?
[122:57.98]That's stupid.
[123:00.38]A baby sits in this during mealtime.
[123:03.94]A crib!
[123:04.88]No, what do they sit in?
[123:06.62]What is, what was, who is, what is, a baby sits in a high chair.

[124:37.77]Towards the light.
[124:38.93]That's a... When sands are... When sands... Plants.
[124:48.78]When plants are exposed to sunlight...
[124:51.94]They go towards sunlight.
[124:53.92]What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[124:57.18]Okay, uh, Christmas tradition.
[124:59.22]Four- four hundred.
[125:05.95]Ah!
[125:07.43]What's happening?
[125:08.75]A traditional Christmas beverage made of eggs, milk, and sugar.
[125:12.49]That's eggnog.
[125:15.89]What is going on?
[125:17.25]What is eggnog?
[125:21.72]What's happening?
[125:24.00]Oh, the other games started playing.
[125:27.30]Shit.
[125:27.62]Hold on.
[125:35.87]The other games are playing.
[125:39.55]How do I mute this?
[125:42.01]Oh, God damn it.
[125:42.68]Hold on.
[125:43.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[125:46.68]Another game opened.
[125:50.99]What the fuck?!
[125:57.60]Hit Ctrl M?
[125:58.86]I- I'm trying!
[125:59.66]Is there- Okay, can we just-
[126:27.81]You know what I figured out when I learned- What?
[126:45.83]You're probably asking what I'm doing here.
[126:48.77]Well, in Magic Land, where all the magic in the world is made, we work very hard.
[126:55.86]Making magic is not at all a simple task.
[126:58.80]You know that.
[127:00.26]And so, from time to time, when I get tired, I sneak out through the secret tunnel and come here for a rest.
[127:09.96]Okay.
[127:11.75]Well...
[127:20.82]Strawberry.
[127:22.40]Was she confused that her... Was she confused that her name was Strawberry?
[127:26.80]She's like, oh, sometimes your name doesn't make any sense.
[127:30.42]You're a strawberry.
[127:31.16]It makes perfect sense.
[127:33.39]I can't explain why they call me Strawberry.
[127:42.93]Oh, that was a joke.
[127:44.27]And while Lazy Strawberry fell into a deep sleep under the tree, a group of children sat in their classroom working on their end of the year school party.
[127:56.80]Oh, goodness.
[127:58.44]And now, I'll assign you your tasks.
[128:02.52]Bill, you'll be the clown.
[128:05.82]That's fucking rude.
[128:07.30]Rude?
[128:08.24]You'll be the dancer.
[128:10.14]That's great!
[128:12.56]Bob, you'll sing.
[128:15.00]I just love to sing.
[128:16.90]And Anthony, you're the butcher.
[128:18.26]Ronnie, you'll be a magician.
[128:21.54]A magician?
[128:23.72]But... But... He doesn't want to be a magician?
[128:33.26]Ronnie was the only one who was disappointed with the part he got.
[128:36.90]How could he do a magician's show when he did not know any magic?
[128:43.42]Ronnie was so sad fucking weird.
[128:45.90]I went I was really He's a muggle
[129:08.35]Sorry, I didn't mean to get you wet, but I'm very sad, and the tears just fall by themselves.
[129:15.71]What's the connection between your being sad and the raindrops falling out of your eyes?
[129:22.25]When children are sad, tears fall from their eyes.
[129:26.17]And I'm sad because I have to put on a magician's show at the class party, and I don't know even one magic trick.
[129:34.37]But who are you?
[129:36.71]I'm Strawberry Magic.
[129:38.82]I'm from Magic Land.
[129:40.44]But everybody works hard there.
[129:42.56]But I escape to here through my secret tunnel so that I can rest.
[129:48.26]Turn him into like a- Turn him into like a banana!
[129:53.72]Or like a fucking kiwi or something.
[130:18.15]That's a very insecure password, by the way.
[130:23.09]That's the magic words?
[130:24.17]Oh, what happens if they can't tell the difference between us?
[130:42.38]is this under a rock in magic land everyone is a hard-working magician you will probably have to work too
[130:55.62]Okay.
[130:56.38]What the fuck?
[130:57.34]Okay.
[130:57.58]Wait, what do you mean, rest here?
[131:22.47]This is magic land.
[131:23.53]Magic land looks identical to real land.
[131:27.29]Something's in the distance.
[131:29.15]I don't know what that is.
[131:30.03]I don't know.
[131:30.34]That could be like a missile.
[131:32.46]Alright.
[131:33.20]I don't know.
[131:33.52]That was fucking scary.
[131:34.82]It was like this thing with fire behind it.
[131:45.31]Where should I go?
[131:55.30]Go over here don't get run over We is this magic land is very grumpy watch out I've already learned that no one is angry without a reason what have you done to the vegetable vendor?
[132:24.53]What did you do to the vegetable vegetable?
[132:26.51]There are two kinds of fruits and vegetables in magic land.
[132:30.29]One kind is for eating, and the other kind is for magic.
[132:34.67]The fruit for eating is grown in the natural way, but the magic fruit and vegetables grow in Abra, the great magician's garden, and they are alive and intelligent creatures, just like me.
[132:46.28]Do you think it was a bad idea to make it so the things that we eat look identical to the magic creatures?
[132:55.44]You think it would be, make the peanuts the magic things, right?
[132:59.49]But what did you do to the vegetable vendor?
[133:03.77]I dressed up as a food vegetable.
[133:05.93]I scared the basket heads a little, so the vendor had to stop selling strawberries.
[133:13.94]You it's you again, how dare you come near my stand, but I have a surprise in store for you What's magical about me?
[133:23.50]I no longer have strawberries on my stand where you can hide and frighten the customers Hey, mr. Vegetable vendor, I just bought a new shipment of fresh fruits and vegetables come here and get him I
[133:37.84]All you have to do is fill the customer's orders and give them exactly what they asked for.
[133:43.36]Hey, man, I got some fresh fruits and vegetables for you.
[133:46.61]Fucking magic land.
[133:48.71]Yeah, hurry up.
[133:49.33]I got a few more deliveries.
[133:50.51]I got two deliveries in the Bronx.
[133:51.99]I got fucking, I got to get a Boston.

[134:28.16]Heads of garlic?
[134:29.64]Are you out of your mind, folks?

[134:59.15]Four, five.
[134:59.95]Okay, goodbye.
[135:03.55]Now you can go.

[135:07.69]Uh oh, he's back.

[135:19.22]Oh my god, they all...
[135:37.79]Seven.
[135:50.78]Now get out of here.
[135:55.31]Isn't that how heavy they are?
[135:59.43]But these aren't magic, this is food.
[136:02.59]I'm so confused.
[136:06.10]How many times do I have to do this?
[136:15.60]This game is giving me brain u- Where's peppers?

[136:40.13]Where's pepper?
[136:43.11]I don't even have peppers.
[136:44.97]That's a tomato.
[136:48.56]Is this carrot?
[136:49.42]I don't have peppers.
[136:54.98]That's not a pepper.
[136:56.18]What the fuck?
[136:57.70]How many do you want?
[136:59.24]How many did you say you wanted?
[137:02.63]How many peppers?
[137:05.65]Six?
[137:12.61]Get out.
[137:15.79]That has to be it.
[137:28.25]Give me my, like, Banjo-Kazooie puzzle piece.
[137:32.49]I see you've made some very nice sales.
[137:34.97]I must have made a lot of money today.
[137:36.70]What is... What?
[137:39.14]Where's the money?
[137:40.14]Do you mean to tell me that you sold the vegetables and didn't ask for money?
[137:44.86]I'm sorry, sir.
[137:47.34]You said to give the basket heads exactly what they asked for.
[137:50.92]And that's exactly what I did.
[137:52.92]They came up every time and said, give me... So I gave them.
[137:59.25]I gotta get money for this guy?
[138:00.71]How much money?
[138:02.05]How much does it cost?
[138:25.78]Let's go help- She's just having a- She's happy that we're fucking with this guy
[138:45.76]Alright, so I gotta get money.
[138:46.74]I don't know how much money it was.
[138:48.26]Alright, let's go.
[138:48.66]I'll be back.
[138:49.20]It's three dollars?
[138:49.67]Should I turn this up?
[138:50.45]Or is it already too loud and annoying for you?
[138:53.33]Looks like I need to turn it up a little.
[139:18.39]Maybe a little bit.
[139:24.56]Right there should be good.
[139:26.88]Right there should be good.
[139:37.49]They drive cars here.
[139:38.35]Alright, what about inside this house?
[139:50.21]Good day, sir.
[139:51.17]How can I help you?
[139:52.06]I don't know.
[139:54.38]Are you a banker?
[139:55.38]Phew!
[139:56.60]They still haven't discovered who let the air out of the tires on their police bikes.
[140:00.75]It was you.
[140:02.89]It was her.
[140:03.27]Really, Mr. Policeman?
[140:05.09]Are you prepared to help me?
[140:08.25]of course it's a policeman's job to help everyone who asks for our help look while I can't say that you're an outstanding magician you're not like those in there have you lost something strawberry uh well I think I'm actually I did bernie bernie voice the magic but I'm looking for it
[140:32.42]You've always been a funny one.
[140:34.32]How could you have lost the magic, silly?
[140:36.60]How can you lose something you don't have?
[140:38.45]It's not even close.
[140:40.27]It's not even close.
[140:41.05]That's true, but I am looking for the magic.
[140:45.09]I can only get my wish through this magic.
[140:49.23]What are they talking about?
[140:52.65]You know you need the magic to have all your wishes come true.
[140:56.19]Not like the prisoners there inside who don't think you need magic in order to get your wishes.
[141:01.07]They steal wishes that have come true from other magicians.
[141:04.57]They're locked up in those cells to make sure they don't harm anyone else.
[141:08.93]But they're causing me to suffer.
[141:10.93]I have to guard them, and I'm pretty tired of it.
[141:14.07]I'd really like to get out for a break.
[141:16.39]Could you guard them for me for a little while?
[141:18.93]Guard the prisoners?
[141:23.50]This motherfucker right here just talked about how dangerous these prisoners were.
[141:28.20]Why would I want to do this?
[141:30.52]How do I do that?
[141:52.15]Why don't you help the poor fellow a little?
[141:54.47]Let him go out for a short break.
[141:58.53]Alright, well go take a break.
[142:01.35]I'll handle this.
[142:01.97]I got it.
[142:02.53]I got this.
[142:04.15]A string of pearls.
[142:05.79]I wonder who it belongs to.
[142:07.30]Okay.
[142:11.00]How do I say go ahead and take a break?
[142:12.74]Yes.
[142:13.52]I'll help you guard them.
[142:21.68]strawberry please meet junior cop the student policeman he's new here and isn't familiar with his job yet junior cop pleased to meet you junior cop why are they leaving us alone look strawberry there is a prisoner in each cell although they are being punished we don't want them to be sad so we allow them to meet visitors
[142:47.38]Uh-huh.
[142:47.58]What?
[143:14.62]When the visit is over, a red light goes on over the door of the visitor's room.
[143:19.02]And you must quickly send Junior Cop.
[143:20.54]Why are they crying?
[143:21.66]If you do not do this quickly, the prisoners will escape and disappear as fast as you can bat an eye.
[143:28.69]Why?
[143:29.49]You can look at a clock to see how much more time you have left until the end of the mission.
[143:34.03]I missed all of that.
[143:36.47]Um, so, oh my god, what do I do?
[143:38.67]Yellow light means... Junior Cop, go let this, open this guy's cell?
[143:46.32]Open it quick!
[143:46.98]Open it!
[143:47.36]Alright.
[144:16.86]The prisoner is escaping.
[144:19.00]What the fuck?
[144:20.68]I failed to do my job right during this shift.
[144:24.34]I'll go back to the desk.
[144:30.58]Don't worry, Strawberry.
[144:32.06]I've already caught the escaped prisoner.
[144:33.80]And he's being led back to his cell at this very moment.
[144:37.42]Be careful next time, Strawberry.
[144:39.00]You just help Larry the Strangler.
[144:41.44]If so, go to the cell block.
[144:45.29]And by the way, he always talks about strangling strawberries, so be careful, try harder next time.
[144:53.71]I don't understand what's going on here.
[144:57.70]So, what do I have to do?
[145:06.13]Whenever a yellow light goes on over a cell, this means that visitors have arrived and you have to open the cell door.
[145:13.43]Send Junior Cop there and press the button to open the door.
[145:19.16]If you don't open the cell door, a red light will go on, and a short time later, it will start blinking.
[145:25.78]If by then you don't open the door, the prisoner will burst out crying and refuse to come out.
[145:33.33]When the visit is over, a red light goes on over the door of the visitor's room.
[145:37.71]And you must quickly send Junior Cop.
[145:40.35]If you do not do this quickly, the prisoners will escape and disappear as fast as you can.
[145:45.01]You need to escort them to the electric chair.
[145:48.23]You can look at a clock to see how much more time you have left until the end of the mission.
[146:01.69]Junior Cop, get over there!
[146:05.09]Junior Cop, what are you doing?
[146:06.67]Junior!
[146:09.05]Okay, now what the fuck do I do?
[146:29.43]I don't get it, what's happening?
[146:41.44]Alright, I got him.
[146:44.72]That it?
[146:45.78]I got him.
[146:47.04]Oh my god.
[147:04.64]What the fuck?
[147:06.28]That was fucked up.
[147:06.94]Strawberry, very good.
[147:08.06]You have been a very good policeman.
[147:10.41]Want to see the magic?
[147:11.95]Here, the magicless Strawberry turns into a brave policeman.
[147:16.52]I now appoint you a policeman in Magicland, and here are your missions.
[147:21.65]One, the string of pearls that belongs to Abreta, the magician's daughter, has been found.
[147:27.16]Take it back to her.
[147:28.90]Two, Abra, the magician's hat, has been stolen.
[147:32.36]We have an identikit picture of the thief.
[147:34.90]Go to the school for beginner magicians and try to find him using this identikit picture.
[147:40.04]Okay, it's a crime sketch?
[147:42.20]Alright, what's on the crime sketch?
[147:46.41]Anybody looking for this kid yet?
[147:49.17]Right?
[147:49.37]I mean...
[148:16.46]Imagine being arrested by a preschooler.
[148:19.18]What the fu- I wanna see what it looks like.
[148:21.80]Okay, well we did this, let's go.
[148:24.14]Okay, so I think we probably go left or right here.
[148:44.30]We can go right.
[148:45.06]Can't go left.
[148:46.56]Let's go right.
[148:50.16]It really is Google Street.
[148:52.77]Just a little guy.
[149:00.43]Okay.
[149:04.71]Hi.
[149:05.73]I'm as happy as happy can be.
[149:07.53]I love a Bretta and a Bretta loves me.
[149:12.36]Oh, dear.
[149:13.78]He's in love with her, too.
[149:15.28]Uh, so what do I... Now what?
[149:21.26]I'm as happy as happy can be.
[149:23.12]I love a bretta and a bretta loves me.
[149:25.37]A bretta?
[149:25.99]A bretta?
[149:27.85]Oh, dear.
[149:29.27]He's in love with her, too.
[149:30.79]Okay, well, I...
[149:36.45]Hey!
[149:36.53]Hello there!
[149:36.83]What is this tunnel?
[149:37.75]Where does it lead?
[149:39.19]And what are you doing here?
[149:40.49]Are you hiding too because you don't want to work?
[150:06.52]Really, Strawberry?
[150:07.90]Not everyone is like you.
[150:10.03]Have you forgotten?
[150:11.45]Behind this door, there is a deep, dark pit.
[150:14.67]Beyond that pit lives the beautiful Firefly Fairy.
[150:18.75]Did you know that the Firefly Fairy can show you the magic within the magic?
[150:23.40]Well, I transport everyone who wishes to reach her.
[150:28.60]If you want to fly on my back to the Firefly Ferry, you must bring me a barrel of juicy nectar of flowers.
[150:35.31]I'm so hungry.
[150:36.59]All right.
[150:39.19]Whatever.
[150:39.55]I don't know.
[150:42.21]I want to look at this.
[150:43.49]I feel like this is the guy here.
[150:46.37]The door will open up if you insert the magic disc in here.
[150:49.51]Okay.
[150:51.17]All right.
[150:51.43]We're going to bring this guy nectar.
[150:53.11]It looks like I can't get past the pit.
[150:56.18]How awful.
[150:59.57]I mean, just bring the guy a bottle of nectar.
[151:01.87]We can go.
[151:02.32]We can leave.
[151:03.32]Can I stop people on the street?
[151:10.54]Down here we got somebody.
[151:11.26]What's going on here?
[151:22.33]Ronnie, this is the place I hate most of all.
[151:25.75]They work very hard here, did you know that?
[151:29.54]Everyone who didn't want to learn the secret of the magic works here.
[151:35.17]But Strawberry, I know that I must look for the magic.
[151:38.47]I'll do anything, even hard work if I have to.
[151:44.20]Strawberry, I knew you'd get here sooner or later.
[151:47.42]After all, all those who didn't want to learn the secret of the magic ended up here and had to do very hard work.
[151:53.96]Why are we having- why?
[151:55.24]I came here for exactly the opposite reason.
[151:58.11]I want to find the magic, and I'm ready to work.
[152:02.75]Come into the construction area and wait for instructions.
[152:06.61]You know what, guys?
[152:07.97]I don't think magic exists.
[152:12.81]I think they're full of shit.
[152:17.58]Oh no, I don't have to do anything because I have magic!
[152:20.13]And all the people that aren't magic need to do all the work!
[152:24.31]What can you do for magic, by the way, Strawberry?
[152:30.12]Lounge in a chair and turn other people into strawberries!
[152:33.96]How does that help us?
[152:38.56]Well, it makes other people fruits and...
[152:44.99]Get back to work!
[152:45.81]Stop questioning me!
[152:47.20]Why are we doing this?
[152:50.14]Do I have to go?
[152:56.12]Useless magic.
[152:57.90]And to talk about useless magic... All magical abilities turn people into people that we look like and they might get eaten by mistake!
[153:06.04]Please operate that crane!
[153:10.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[153:15.21]if you keep this up and refuse to work you won't get very far what does he want me to do what did he say I was too busy being upset
[153:36.02]Where's the construction?
[153:36.92]Where is that though?
[153:38.06]That's a construction yard right here, isn't it?
[153:40.12]That's what I'm trying to do.
[153:58.76]Wall that's not painted.
[153:59.54]Where is it?
[153:59.80]What the fuck?
[154:00.26]What the fuck?
[154:00.80]I have to go left?
[154:01.34]Go left, not down.
[154:02.34]This is...
[154:22.95]Strawberry?
[154:23.47]I know.
[154:23.75]Okay.
[154:23.91]Go left instead of left.
[154:45.92]What the hell is this?
[154:48.10]What an interesting place.
[154:50.29]I wonder what kind of work they do here.
[154:54.23]Your attention please.
[154:55.93]Box boys, get ready to paint and form a line.
[155:00.21]Box boys, you must jump into the pool of paint and fill up with the right color.
[155:05.39]After that, march to the wall and splash the paint on the bricks.
[155:09.66]Strawberry, you will have to change the color in the pool so that the box boy that will jump into it will be filled with the right color and splash it in the right order.
[155:19.34]But- Box boys, jump!
[155:21.44]Why are we doing this to these people?
[155:24.04]What color do they want?
[155:28.24]What color do I need it to be?
[155:30.00]What color do I need it to be?
[155:31.22]Red?
[155:31.52]What color does this have to be?
[155:35.36]I don't understand what's happening.
[155:36.84]Red or... I don't understand what's going on.
[155:39.87]Do I have to do red, purple, blue, red?
[155:45.59]Does this make any sense?
[155:48.31]Yellow?
[155:53.44]I don't get it.
[155:54.30]What's happening?
[155:55.98]Red?
[156:00.22]I don't know what they were asking for.
[156:04.18]Does it matter?
[156:05.20]They already ruined it.
[156:08.46]Green now?
[156:09.62]What?
[156:12.20]Is it just yellow, green, blue?
[156:14.44]It's not like a pattern.
[156:20.37]It's just solid.
[156:22.19]Now we'll do blue.
[156:25.44]I thought it was... I had to do some kind of pattern or something.
[156:27.90]You fucking idiot.
[156:28.80]Yeah, okay, so it's... I get it, I get it, I get it.
[156:31.85]I get it, I get it.
[156:34.25]So that means I need two more, and then we gotta go purple after this one goes in.
[157:26.23]You're saying this is the new Radiohead album?
[157:31.77]So then I gotta change to yellow.
[157:33.59]I'll get it.
[157:35.75]I'm incredibly invested in this game, by the way.
[157:37.75]We're not going anywhere for a little while.
[157:43.89]Okay, red, red.
[157:46.85]Now back to yellow.
[157:47.77]Yep, okay.
[157:53.99]And then, oh my god, this is gonna take fucking forever.
[157:56.73]Shit.
[157:57.11]Come- I'm here, go!
[157:58.17]Do it!
[157:58.80]DO IT!
[158:27.50]Strawberry, go back into the construction area, and see to it that the wall is painted properly.
[158:33.30]Any wall that is only partly painted, or is not properly painted, is washed clean, and you have to start all over again.
[158:40.57]Okay.
[158:42.37]I'll get it.
[158:42.69]I'll get it right.
[158:46.29]I'll go and continue painting the wall.
[158:48.32]Yay, please do.
[158:50.56]Yay, hooray, please do.
[158:54.00]Alright, red.
[158:55.64]This is torture.
[158:58.89]You're fine, relax.
[159:02.53]You're fine.
[159:03.31]Oh, the box boys.
[159:05.01]Alright, we got it this time.
[159:10.22]Just turn your volume down for like 10 minutes.
[159:12.48]It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[159:12.96]So 5, uh... Red paints.
[159:13.72]And then yellow.
[159:26.82]So that's... I need one more red.
[159:30.42]And yellow.
[159:32.16]Bingo.
[159:32.52]Bingo.
[159:57.05]Okay, now blue.
[160:03.01]Let's go.
[160:07.47]You're making sleeper agents wake up with this song.
[160:13.16]It's not a big deal.
[160:14.44]It's just a background song.
[160:16.10]Okay, one, two, three, four.
[160:19.24]So, one, two, and one more.
[160:21.66]And we're going purple.
[160:28.61]Dunk in there.
[160:29.21]Perfect.
[160:31.47]This game sucks.
[160:36.29]Excuse me, you're talking about Strawberry Magic being a bad game?
[160:40.26]That's kind of, um... You've just annoyed me, is what you've done.
[160:46.44]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[160:48.72]One.
[160:50.54]One more, and then green.
[160:51.80]And then that's it.
[160:55.80]Alright, we're almost out.
[161:03.22]Are you still playing this?
[161:04.16]I'm invested.
[161:08.36]Are you not curious about this?
[161:10.04]I'll turn it down if it's too annoying.
[161:13.28]I'm very curious.
[161:14.18]Yeah, I am too.
[161:14.82]Okay, that's it.
[161:15.36]That's it!
[161:32.85]That's it.
[161:33.31]Stop painting.
[161:33.87]That's it.
[161:35.37]That's it.
[161:35.63]I swear to God, this guy gives me like $3.
[161:37.15]Oh, yeah.
[161:37.31]There you go.
[161:37.71]Here's your $3.
[161:38.41]Okay, so that's it.
[162:02.11]Strawberry, you managed the wall painting job very well.
[162:05.99]The painting crew was happy to work with you.
[162:08.45]I must say, you have made some real progress.
[162:11.77]Here is a barrel of nectar from the finest flowers.
[162:14.95]It's yours.
[162:16.11]This is your pay for your work today.
[162:18.22]Oh.
[162:20.10]Thank you, Mr. Foreman, and goodbye.
[162:22.18]Thanks for the... Thanks for what amounts to a individual bag of gushers.
[162:34.61]I got the nectar though.
[162:39.10]That's for the bird, yeah?
[162:51.61]So we know we gotta go that way, but let's go left.
[162:55.61]We haven't gone over here yet.
[162:58.77]I think this is the magic school.
[163:06.89]Hey, where are you going?
[163:09.40]You can't go any further.
[163:11.40]This is the school for magicians, and only people who have magic wands are allowed in.
[163:17.92]If you have a wand, show me.
[163:19.88]If not, don't bother me.
[163:27.73]That's a pity.
[163:29.59]I could learn some magic at this school.
[163:32.55]I'll try and get a wand.
[163:40.89]Can I just walk in?
[163:41.35]Alright, well it looks like we're going to take the nectar.
[163:46.57]Alright, let's go.
[163:47.33]Next game for the love of... No, we're almost done.
[163:52.06]Do you understand?
[163:53.96]Like, I'm beating this one.
[164:03.35]We're so close.
[164:04.07]We have to go to the magic school, then we have to go... I'm playing this still.
[164:09.63]This is how it's working.
[164:15.77]I have an exam, but this is more important.
[164:18.13]Your schooling is more important.
[164:20.15]I'll be here.
[164:22.23]Okay, here you go.
[164:24.03]Here's the nectar.
[164:24.67]Oh...
[164:32.39]The barrel of nectar is closed with a lid.
[164:34.93]I can't get to the nectar.
[164:37.55]Huh?
[164:38.21]You give me a watched barrel of nectar?
[164:42.17]It looks like I can't get past the pit.
[164:48.67]How awful.
[164:49.59]That's a lot of nectar, by the way.
[164:51.08]I thought it was small.
[164:51.98]This thing's huge.
[164:54.74]That actually might be worth like... That might actually be worth like a hundred bucks.
[165:04.79]Is it Nectar or is it LSD?
[165:06.37]Alright, there's another way we can go.
[165:12.75]Alright.
[165:20.59]Did we go?
[165:21.13]We went?
[165:21.71]Yeah, we gotta go straight here.
[165:25.03]This game is very expansive.
[165:26.19]This game is a big game.
[165:27.49]Let's go over here.
[165:31.45]Alright.
[165:33.96]I'm thinking just right here.
[165:35.46]The gate is closed and the breeder bird is guarding the garden.
[165:38.66]Breeder bird?
[165:43.65]What?
[165:46.09]I'm sorry.
[165:46.89]I can't come over and open the gate for you.
[165:50.17]I have to mine the eggs until they hatch in pairs.
[165:53.31]Are those people?
[165:57.95]Who's hatching?
[166:03.78]Off-key piano is... scary.
[166:23.86]I really tried hard to plan things so that there will be two of each color I tried to peek inside the eggs, but Shelley who guards the eggs won't let me disturb them
[166:42.38]That's right.
[166:43.56]She always comes looking and disturbs them.
[166:46.36]The chicks need their rest.
[166:48.00]She opens the egg and immediately forgets the chick's color.
[166:51.94]What?
[166:52.14]So it's a matching game?
[166:54.12]I really do want to know if every chick has a partner.
[166:58.16]When you do find a pair, their shells will get colored in the same color.
[167:03.09]That way I won't be worried.
[167:04.77]It's a matching game.
[167:06.13]This music.
[167:09.03]It's like...
[167:12.62]This person's fucking going crazy on piano.
[167:17.61]Okay, red.
[167:26.25]Green.
[167:28.19]Blue.
[167:30.69]Dark blue.
[167:42.85]Yellow.
[167:43.33]No.
[167:47.89]Red.
[167:48.23]Red.
[167:51.23]Okay.
[167:52.81]Blue.
[168:00.28]Yellow and yellow.
[168:01.16]Is this one right?
[168:02.42]No, it's this one.
[168:03.14]Okay.
[168:05.44]Okay.
[168:12.13]Here he goes!
[168:12.71]Okay, green.
[168:15.61]Okay.
[168:16.39]Strawberry, you're wonderful!
[168:21.23]I have exactly one pair of every kind!
[168:23.63]Now I'm ready to open the gate.
[168:42.16]This game was probably the Elden Ring of its time.
[168:44.22]I'm not so sure about that.
[168:48.38]Alright, so what's in here?
[168:58.27]I want a detailed animated scene of her nose.
[169:01.33]Wrapping around like all broken and shit and turning the handle to her nose.
[169:05.61]Oh my god, it actually did it.
[169:08.07]What the fuck?
[169:18.08]Who's this?
[169:18.38]Is that a magician?
[169:27.36]Excuse me.
[169:28.26]Excuse me, Strawberry.
[169:29.26]Just a moment.
[169:30.24]Are you going into the garden by any chance?
[169:33.45]Yes.
[169:34.49]Hey, who are you?
[169:36.83]I finally met someone among all these strange creatures who talk like one thing and look like something else who's a magician.
[169:43.85]A real magician.
[169:47.52]Creatures who look like one thing and talk like something else?
[169:50.04]Those are clothes, Strawberry.
[169:51.02]Pardon me for asking, but you don't look exactly like you sound.
[169:55.32]I know.
[169:55.80]I look so funny only because I had to find the magic.
[170:00.34]What is happening?
[170:01.90]What's so funny about looking like me?
[170:07.11]You look like that because you are looking for the magic?
[170:10.71]I'll let you in on a secret.
[170:12.38]You and your friends in this weird place really do need first-rate magic so as not to look the way you look.
[170:19.33]You're a magician, aren't you?
[170:22.74]That's right.
[170:23.78]I'm a magician.
[170:24.96]That's my profession.
[170:25.98]I learned hundreds of tricks and illusions, and when I appear on the stage with my rabbit, everyone thinks that everything is real.
[170:32.76]But between you and me, everything is an illusion.
[170:35.79]You know, the hand is quicker than the eye.
[170:37.57]But I'm telling this only to you, because you belong to this world, and you'll never get to my world, and you won't be able to reveal this secret to my audiences.
[170:47.35]You mean you don't have any real magic at all?
[170:51.58]That's right.
[170:52.53]It's all illusions.
[170:54.07]Look, time is passing quickly and I have to appear in the circus in a little while.
[170:58.57]My rabbit decided that he doesn't want to appear with me anymore and be part of my act with its false magic tricks.
[171:04.59]No magic.
[171:04.91]He ran away to this place.
[171:06.79]He says that the real magic is only here.
[171:09.61]I have to find him and get him out of this weird place.
[171:11.68]How is everybody getting here?
[171:13.38]If I see a rabbit, I'll catch it and bring it back to you.
[171:16.78]How did he get here?
[171:19.80]How did this guy get here?
[171:23.65]We had to get shrunken down into a fruit and then go under a weird rock.
[171:27.99]How did you get here?
[171:29.06]I have no idea.
[171:33.28]This guy just appeared and dropped a lore bomb?
[171:47.93]Ronnie, this is the rabbit's restaurant.
[171:50.25]The rabbits come here to eat carrots.
[171:52.70]If you wait here, you might be able to catch the rabbit.
[171:56.30]the restaurant for rabbits the magician's rabbit is very fussy about what he eats he's used to eating well and only eats in five star restaurants what if you want him to come here you must provide the best service to your rabbit customers when a rabbit comes in you must serve him his carrots immediately that way your restaurant will be awarded more stars and the magicians rabbit will appear
[172:20.95]When he gets here, serve him some carrots and grab him.
[172:24.88]Remember, you can take only up to three carrots on your tray each time.
[172:29.18]Diner dash now?
[172:32.20]Okay.
[172:33.22]Here comes a rabbit.
[172:35.90]I gotta serve very quickly.
[172:36.96]What table are you going to?
[172:39.04]Here?
[172:47.05]Coming!
[172:50.61]Hurry the fuck up!
[172:51.31]Why are you going so slow?
[172:55.99]Did it work?
[173:02.67]They're leaving bad reviews.
[173:04.27]I hate that voice.
[173:23.30]Hurry up and get over here.
[173:24.02]Alright, I got four stars now.
[173:31.15]The Magician's Rabbit only comes to five-star restaurants.
[173:37.49]Oh, you left a bad review.
[173:40.37]Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[173:42.51]Jesus, come on, man.
[173:47.96]I got pissed so bad.
[174:00.19]Alright.
[174:01.73]Where's the magician's rabbit?
[174:05.21]Which one is the magician's rabbit?
[174:10.37]Is there a way to tell?
[174:16.65]You dick.
[174:23.41]Hurry up!
[174:25.17]Thank you very much!
[174:30.50]Where's the... How do I know which is the... I don't know what to do.
[174:37.07]Are they all the magician's rabbit?
[174:40.29]How do you tell?
[174:41.85]Who's who?
[174:42.57]Oh my god, dude.
[174:43.45]I don't know.
[174:44.05]I don't know.
[174:59.20]Wait, she's trying to say something.
[175:01.48]There he is, there he is, there he is.
[175:02.48]Alright.
[175:04.06]We gotta grab this guy.
[175:14.69]Rabbit.
[175:16.49]Cute little rabbit.
[175:18.37]Someone is desperately looking for you.
[175:21.31]He misses you.
[175:24.05]Where's the magician?
[175:25.39]I miss him too, and I want to go home.
[175:28.82]Come along, little rabbit.
[175:30.46]We'll go to the magician.
[175:31.58]Alright, now maybe I'll get some money?
[175:36.83]Strawberry, don't forget.
[175:38.25]If you see my rabbit, tell him to come back to me.
[175:41.76]Sounds like somebody... This guy sounds like... Rabbit!
[175:45.80]Strawberry, I'm so grateful to you for finding my rabbit.
[175:48.90]Listen, I have to ask another small favor.
[175:51.86]While I was looking for my rabbit, I scattered lots of candy along the paths.
[175:56.06]I wanted the rabbit to find him and understand that I was looking for him.
[175:59.21]But unfortunately, someone gobbled them all up.
[176:02.85]He got stiff from eating so much.
[176:04.95]So, please, take this medicine powder and sprinkle it on him so that he can move again.
[176:12.16]Medicine powder?
[176:13.00]I didn't know that rabbit was that big.
[176:15.70]Alright, sprinkle the medicine powder.
[176:17.76]What was that for?
[176:18.96]Medicine powder.
[176:42.25]Jesus.
[176:56.05]All right, is this a... Hello, strawberry.
[176:59.85]Hungry, eh?
[177:01.13]Poor little rascal.
[177:02.83]When will you understand that you have to help out a little?
[177:06.02]You simply can't just walk around snatching things from here and there.
[177:10.44]You'd really like some cake, wouldn't you?
[177:12.94]Well, you give me some help, and I'll give you a very good cake.
[177:17.52]Ooh, a very good cake.
[177:19.12]Do what he asks.
[177:20.52]His cakes are delicious.
[177:24.86]Alright, I get a piece.
[177:25.42]I must prepare a cake that was ordered especially for the chickpeas.
[177:29.62]They will break out of the eggs today.
[177:31.80]Now this is their first birthday.
[177:34.13]I must prepare a cake in their honor.
[177:36.01]Exactly according to the framed drawing.
[177:38.93]Can you help me bring the layers of cake having the right shape and color?
[177:42.61]That cake is dog shit.
[177:43.89]They don't have no frosting?
[177:47.66]No decorations?
[177:48.40]It's just three cake tops.
[177:50.48]That cake sucks.
[177:54.13]I gotta pee I'll be right back.
[183:27.70]Okay.
[183:29.60]I am back.
[183:30.00]How long does it take you to pee?
[183:34.31]Um, well, I didn't just pee.
[183:36.79]I refilled my water slash green tea slash matcha slash drink.
[183:48.52]I refilled my green water.
[183:50.20]That's right.
[183:55.34]He took a bong hit.
[184:02.97]No, no CBD.
[184:04.01]I'm not, I haven't been high on stream for almost a year and a half.
[184:11.20]Ever since the analog clock incident, I have been like, no, no, I can't do that anymore.
[184:21.08]I was just like, I can't do it.
[184:22.47]I cannot stream and be high.
[184:25.49]I can't.
[184:27.65]I was walking in circles and stuff and I couldn't read analog clocks.
[184:30.99]No, that can't happen.
[184:35.94]Okay, let's get back to it.
[184:37.08]We're continuing strawberry magic.
[184:41.88]I feel like we're getting probably close to the conclusion.
[184:47.33]If I were to take a wild guess... I'd say we're getting close.
[185:03.60]This is a 60 hour game.
[185:04.68]I highly doubt that.
[185:12.71]60 hour games could not exist on the DOS.
[185:20.53]Here we are.
[185:20.97]Okay.
[185:25.39]That's a good volume.
[185:26.13]Let's bring it back.
[185:43.76]Alright.
[185:46.20]Alright, we need to make the cake, right?
[185:48.70]So it's just one of these.
[185:49.58]What are you talking about?
[185:50.88]Oh, what a nice cake.
[185:51.42]It's up there already.
[185:52.90]Fucking bozo.
[185:55.14]It's right there!
[186:13.74]This is the drawing of the cake that was ordered.
[186:15.97]That- So, hand it in!
[186:20.93]Strawberry, please bring me layers of cake.
[186:23.79]Exactly according to the drawing.
[186:26.66]What?
[186:26.88]It's right in front of this guy.
[186:29.44]I have to look for the right layer.
[186:31.12]Huh?
[186:33.52]I have to look for the right layer.
[186:37.22]That's wrong?
[186:38.06]How is that wrong?
[186:38.89]I have to look for the right layer.
[186:40.83]Are you shitting me?
[186:46.22]Oh, God damn it.
[186:48.06]What the hell is going on here?
[186:49.54]I have to reset.
[186:54.02]I gotta reset it.
[186:55.66]What is it?
[186:56.72]What is it?
[186:57.54]Talk about high.
[187:02.44]What the fuck?
[187:03.66]How do I get rid of this?
[187:19.06]Am I actually soft-locked?
[187:20.00]How do I get rid of this?
[187:25.71]Click the curtain?
[187:31.43]Shit.
[187:33.87]How do I restart?
[187:41.16]How do I start?
[187:44.72]To make one next to it?
[187:45.50]I can't.
[187:48.28]I can't make it.
[187:49.80]No!
[187:52.94]Strawberry, please bring me layers of cake exactly according to the drawing and put them on the table.
[188:00.92]Drag it off?
[188:01.68]I have to look for the right layer.
[188:03.16]I can't.
[188:05.72]Probably putting the top layer back.
[188:08.22]I don't need this part of the cake.
[188:09.96]Thank you to that person in chat.
[188:12.46]I don't need this part of the cake.
[188:18.90]Alright, so get rid of this.
[188:20.90]I don't need this part of the cake.
[188:22.20]Alright, so what is this?
[188:22.95]What the hell does this even look like?
[188:24.11]Like this?
[188:24.55]Is that it?
[188:31.63]Strawberry, please bring me layers of cake exactly according to the drawing and put them on the table.
[188:38.02]There are sauces in the top left.
[188:40.96]I have to look for the right layer.
[188:45.24]I don't need this part of the cake.
[188:51.75]smaller I have to look for the right pick it up just grab it and put it back strawberry strawberry put it back I don't need this part of the cake it's the smallest one I don't need this part of the cake I mean like this one here and then the teeny little one
[189:16.19]That doesn't look right.
[189:17.15]That looks wrong, doesn't it?
[189:18.33]Okay.
[189:19.19]R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[189:40.15]R1, R1.
[189:40.69]Hey, oh, strawberries.
[189:42.51]Okay.
[189:43.59]That's how it's going to be?
[189:45.01]Then that's what we're going to do.
[189:46.97]Fight to you.
[189:47.41]Kind of botched it, but that's kind of what it sounds like.
[189:50.19]Fight to you.
[190:01.80]Pulls out great sword, yeah.
[190:04.23]It's like R1.
[190:04.81]R1.
[190:05.23]Hey, no.
[190:06.39]What are you?
[190:06.85]Strawberry.
[190:07.85]All right, then.
[190:09.17]It's time to have a battle.
[190:14.46]I just decorated the exact same way you got it.
[190:18.78]What was that?
[190:45.59]I think I've decorated the cake exactly according to the picture.
[190:49.78]I'll show it to the baker.
[190:54.01]We've managed to make a wonderful cake for the chickpeas.
[190:57.57]I can't wait for them to break out of their shells.
[191:00.35]Here, take the cake I promised you.
[191:02.65]Enjoy every bite.
[191:12.94]I got it.
[191:14.32]I got some items.
[191:16.66]Please end this.
[191:17.52]Oh.
[191:34.03]We're at the final three or four areas.
[191:35.91]This is like the final three spots.
[191:39.13]I have no idea where this is, but I hope they want a cake.
[191:53.01]Boxes and packages, packages and boxes.
[191:56.55]Scurry, scurry, scurry, I deliver in a hurry.
[192:01.41]Hello, sir.
[192:02.50]What are you doing?
[192:05.33]Strawberry, strawberry, you really are something else.
[192:08.81]You're so innocent all of a sudden.
[192:10.69]Hello, sir, what are you doing?
[192:12.93]What are you doing here?
[192:14.57]Have you forgotten that my last delivery is being held up on account of you?
[192:18.86]You rummaged around in all the packages, so please go somewhere else.
[192:23.92]If you show up here again, I'll put you into a box and I'll send you to the farthest place I know.
[192:31.62]The farthest place he knows of is that warehouse over there.
[192:35.80]All day long, all he does is work.
[192:38.12]Put you into a box.
[192:40.38]Strawberry, honestly, be a little more serious.
[192:44.61]You promised that if I came here, you would help me discover the secret of the magic.
[192:49.67]In the meantime, all I do is work instead of you, and you sit there laughing at everybody.
[192:55.20]Yeah, what's up with this?
[192:57.59]I'm not laughing.
[192:59.35]I just don't understand.
[193:02.07]I've always been nice to everyone, and I've always wanted to play.
[193:05.78]He did not dedicate to the rhyming.
[193:08.88]And you, you've just arrived, and everybody loves you.
[193:15.10]That's right.
[193:16.10]It's because I help everyone, not like you.
[193:18.65]Mr. Potter, sir, you really did misbehave yesterday, but today I've come to help.
[193:29.30]To help?
[193:30.32]What happened today that made you decide that?
[193:32.78]Fucking crazy.
[193:34.74]I decided to look for the magic, and I'm ready to do anything to find it.
[193:40.04]Go socks!
[193:40.64]Good.
[193:41.41]Now you're talking like a resident of magic land.
[193:45.19]So, listen very carefully.
[193:47.87]The cost of shipping these packages is very high.
[193:51.83]So we have to stuff as many of them into crates as we can without leaving any empty spaces.
[193:58.19]The packages coming off the conveyor belt are of different sizes, so it is possible to fit every box into an empty space until the crate is completely full.
[194:09.50]You can start now.
[194:10.66]OK.
[194:25.69]Fill the box with stuff.
[194:27.87]These packages have been sorted and are ready to be shipped later on.
[194:31.33]Don't touch them.
[194:32.92]Airline?
[194:35.20]Find out.
[194:35.52]This is just bald to emphasize her.
[194:56.70]I think it's fine.
[194:57.96]Ooh.
[194:59.90]Ooh.
[195:03.26]Ooh.
[195:05.29]Ooh.
[195:11.29]Ooh.
[195:16.11]This fucking game is fucking stupid.
[195:24.71]Where's the moment?
[195:25.25]Where's the moment to go?
[195:28.44]Chad, do you fucking, uh, what was it?
[195:33.07]This game's for fucking kids, I don't give a fuck.
[195:37.33]I'm playing a fucking kids game and you guys are talking shit in the fucking chat.
[195:42.39]Yeah, okay.
[195:45.15]Pickle nose, pickle nose.
[195:46.55]Did you fucking say that?
[195:49.91]Pickle nose?
[195:50.73]Shut the fuck up.
[195:53.71]What do I actually have to do?
[196:00.43]I didn't pay any attention to this.
[196:06.62]I didn't pay any attention.
[196:07.72]Go to the next... game?
[196:17.89]No!
[196:18.35]I- I've- what did I think- what did he want me to do?
[196:21.37]Ox on the left.
[196:22.39]Okay.
[196:23.29]Pack up packages.
[196:29.39]This is where the packages for shipment come out.
[196:32.03]Okay.
[196:33.99]Where do they... These packages have been sorted and are ready to be shipped later on.
[196:38.41]Don't touch them.
[196:40.73]What do I have to do?
[196:44.14]Oh, whoa!
[196:55.80]This is where the packages for shipment come out.
[197:01.04]So how does it start a shipment?
[197:02.12]Let's go.
[197:15.80]This is where the packages for shipment come out.
[197:18.43]The left package?
[197:21.31]Where?
[197:24.59]This one looks like I can touch it, right?
[197:25.95]These packages have been sorted and are ready to be shipped later on.
[197:28.57]In the box near the shipment window.
[197:31.22]Over here?
[197:32.30]These packages have been sorted and are ready to be shipped later on.
[197:35.00]Oh, it's so low poly I couldn't even see it.
[197:37.18]I see it.
[197:43.33]There.
[197:44.91]Oh, God.
[197:46.33]Phew, that's it.
[198:00.54]Phew!
[198:01.54]That's it!
[198:07.70]Oh!
[198:08.28]This is heavy!
[198:09.36]Am I doing this right?
[198:10.78]There!
[198:11.90]Phew!
[198:12.52]That's it!
[198:32.45]How many packages do I have to put in here?
[198:33.93]What the hell?
[198:34.55]This is not worse than the Daedalus encounter.
[198:45.64]Get outta here.
[198:46.38]No way.
[198:48.08]Not even remotely close.
[198:50.62]No fucking way.
[198:53.54]No way.
[198:55.36]Oh my god, how dare you.
[198:57.37]Now, you know how I know that?
[198:59.47]Because when I was playing the Daedalus encounter, I looked over at chat, which I was trying to- I was ignoring chat for a lot of that stream, because when I looked over, it was a sea, a sea of people begging me, begging me to stop playing it.
[199:18.13]It was like begging.
[199:20.32]Like, dude, fucking stop.
[199:21.80]Please, please do anything else, man.
[199:23.56]Just do, like, tier lists or something.
[199:25.78]It was seriously every single comment.
[199:27.42]Every single one.
[199:28.02]And I ignored it.
[199:31.26]Oh, it was ridiculous.
[199:38.09]This is so awful.
[199:39.19]Hopefully I'm doing this right.
[199:40.63]I don't want to do this again.
[199:44.99]Oh my god, it was so bad.
[199:50.77]This minigame is bad, I will give you that.
[199:52.33]Oh my god, can we please?
[199:59.23]Thank you.
[200:02.60]Worst stream ever?
[200:03.46]Dead Alice Encounter?
[200:04.44]I don't know what the worst stream I've ever done is.
[200:06.46]I could probably give my opinion.
[200:20.54]I think that's money we can bring to the fruit vendor.
[200:23.22]I think the worst dream that I actually really have ever done is that card one.
[200:26.76]Goodbye!
[200:27.70]Like unlock card, like dungeon one.
[200:30.28]That was unbelievably bad.
[200:33.79]Unbelievable.
[200:37.61]That was the worst thing I've ever done.
[200:42.41]My camera was too low quality.
[200:44.69]You couldn't even read the cards.
[200:48.20]You physically couldn't even see what was going on.
[200:50.84]I thought that was going to be way more fun.
[200:53.57]Fortnite tournament was not, Fortnite was fun.
[200:55.49]That was like fun because like the group we were having a good time.
[200:58.11]Yeah.
[200:58.89]I didn't play very well, but I mean, that was a fun stream for me.
[201:01.87]This funny house is the artist's home.
[201:08.11]He copies pictures all day long.
[201:10.62]Okay.
[201:12.14]So this is the painting.
[201:17.46]You tried.
[201:17.90]It was just fun.
[201:22.00]Strawberry, this artist doesn't look very busy at all.
[201:27.94]That's what you think, Ronnie.
[201:30.05]This whole town looks like it's asleep, but you'll soon see that it's the opposite.
[201:34.61]This guy's a little freaked out that we walked in his house without asking.
[201:38.61]Hello, Mr. Clovey.
[201:44.43]Hello, Strawberry.
[201:46.17]Walking around doing nothing as usual, eh?
[201:51.06]Oh, no, sir.
[201:52.68]What are you painting?
[201:55.50]Two days from now, we are going to open an exhibition of the paintings of the greatest artists in the world.
[202:01.91]There's one picture that I could not get for the exhibition, so I have to make an exact copy of it.
[202:07.95]I've already drawn it, but my eyes are tired and I am not sure that the copy is exactly like the original.
[202:13.95]I have to copy his copy?
[202:16.11]Alright, I'll copy your copy.
[202:21.02]Maybe I can help you.
[202:24.04]You, I find that hard to believe.
[202:26.90]Since when do you want to do anything?
[202:29.06]Oh, now you're doing, you're doing, oh, okay.
[202:33.91]Being a waiter is hard work.
[202:36.61]I don't have the strength for that now.
[202:38.65]Hon, hon, hon.
[202:41.55]I am prepared to help, Mr. Clovey.
[202:44.05]Okay, but then I copy this exact same thing?
[202:54.27]Oh, you really did a pretty botched job on this one, Clovey.
[203:03.00]A lot of things, actually.
[203:04.90]You fucked up.
[203:05.50]I'll show them to you.
[203:07.38]You fucked up.
[203:29.70]Why are you helping this guy make forgeries?
[203:32.13]What?
[203:32.99]Um...
[204:00.13]I don't know if I want to go into this secret library.
[204:02.41]That face.
[204:11.62]There are lots of books in the library.
[204:14.84]I'm looking for the book with the great secret.
[204:18.07]Maybe, if I find it, I'll be able to do some magic.
[204:22.80]Magic's not real, the guy just told you that.
[204:24.26]Okay, so we have to find the book?
[204:25.76]Oh my god.
[204:51.16]the art of copying pictures I need to get the code if I want to find the secret book I need to get the library code will he give it to me thank you very much sir you have a very impressive collection of books he's still playing this yeah to be among the fortunate people who have visited your library what um you guys don't have a phone here
[205:20.39]I have way too many items to stop now.
[205:23.22]Don't die Dallas Encounter me on this one.
[205:24.82]Alright, I need the code to get in there.
[205:32.92]There's only two or three locations I haven't been to.
[205:38.00]I have not been here, and I haven't been in one spot over there.
[205:40.16]I kind of want to see how it plays out.
[205:46.15]Do we do a, um... I want to see if I come back to the real world as a magician.
[205:54.19]Oh dear, this is an order for red painted furniture.
[205:57.69]All the pieces must be painted in red and I've run out of paint.
[206:02.81]Excuse me, Mr. Carpenter, sir?
[206:06.23]I remember watching two Swedish dudes play this.
[206:08.17]Don't bother me.
[206:08.63]I'm prepared to stop working and talk only to someone who will bring me red paint for the furniture.
[206:13.59]Oh yeah, I remember these two Swedish dudes played this before.
[206:16.19]Ronnie, get out of here!
[206:17.30]That's fucking awesome.
[206:18.04]The noise of the jigsaw is bursting my eardrums.
[206:21.38]If you have red paint, give it to him.
[206:24.06]If not, leave here.
[206:25.64]What?
[206:25.82]I don't... How do I get red paint?
[206:31.33]This is where the carpenter saws his boards.
[206:36.67]Well, okay, I know I have the money to go to the fruit vendor.
[206:40.07]I'm doing that.
[206:40.99]And yes, I'm going to complete the game.
[206:48.79]Paint it with blood.
[206:51.99]Not funny.
[206:55.82]That's not funny.
[206:56.68]Paint it with blood.
[206:58.84]Okay.
[207:00.62]Like, just gross and uncalled for.
[207:02.54]Disgusting.
[207:03.04]Not funny.
[207:04.64]Not funny.
[207:20.28]Alright, here's a coin.
[207:20.88]I do.
[207:21.90]Do you have red paint?
[207:22.86]Goddammit, you were the Hyuk Hyuk guy and I got it wrong.
[207:27.07]So can I- is this- can I make this red paint?
[207:30.39]Who wants a cherry?
[207:51.41]There's one place I didn't go.
[207:52.65]I need to go to the magic school.
[207:55.65]Where's the magic school?
[207:57.77]Bro.
[208:00.12]Bro.
[208:00.68]Where's the magic school?

[208:08.12]Not happening.
[208:08.54]Alright, so it's not this way.
[208:11.78]It's to the right and straight.
[208:16.39]Still at least an hour left.
[208:17.81]I'm not going anywhere.
[208:18.89]I don't know why people think I'm just going to leave after this game's done.
[208:21.63]I've only been streaming for like three hours.
[208:22.99]I'm not just going to be like, alright, strawberry magic was cool.
[208:26.61]I'll see you guys next time.
[208:28.53]No, I'm still here.
[208:29.49]And you almost missed the gobble goodie.
[208:45.79]of the magician gave me.
[208:49.17]You almost missed the gobble goodie.
[208:50.93]Okay.
[208:53.87]Medicine powder.
[208:58.61]I ache all over.
[209:10.57]I must have been standing like that for years.
[209:16.11]Hey, I'm hungry.
[209:18.23]I'm so hungry.
[209:19.81]Did I give him a cake?
[209:22.51]A cake?
[209:23.17]Here.
[209:23.97]This cake is really great.
[209:26.59]I prepared it myself.
[209:31.69]Ugh.
[209:35.83]Mmm.
[209:36.69]Tasty.
[209:38.05]Very tasty.
[209:39.78]Oops.
[209:40.76]The dice cube got loose.
[209:43.66]From what?
[209:44.58]Where?
[209:45.08]Ronny, the dice cube!
[209:47.13]I've been looking for it for a long time.
[209:49.69]It's special because it can open places that have been closed by magic.
[209:53.59]Unbelievable!
[209:55.65]It's been inside Gobblegoody's tummy all along.
[209:58.31]You eat everything that moves, stands still, or lies down.
[210:03.26]Everything!
[210:03.92]I can open magical doors with the magical cube.
[210:08.84]Magic dice cube.
[210:13.46]Thanks.
[210:14.14]Okay, so let's keep going.
[210:16.02]Thank you, um... Whatever your name was, I don't remember.
[210:20.07]Uh, nothing else I can do here.
[210:22.05]Can I go left or right?
[210:23.41]Is it S tier item?
[210:26.13]Yeah.
[210:28.11]Let's go right.
[210:30.96]Oh, here we go.
[210:32.16]Oh, there's so much.
[210:33.08]I love this.
[210:33.54]Alright, let's go to the hot dog stand.
[210:50.78]But what did you do to the vegetable vendor?
[210:54.70]What?
[210:55.72]Lonnie, these two funny guys know the magic of how to make the best sugar coating in the world.
[211:02.22]The recipe is a very carefully guarded secret, and that's why it was divided up between the two of them.
[211:09.46]Are you going to enable PvP invasions in the game?
[211:13.30]If you give them a piece of fruit, they'll sugarcoat it for you with their own special magic coating.
[211:20.70]I have a cherry right here.
[211:21.66]Fresh cherry here.
[211:24.52]I have a cherry and really would like you to coat it with your world-renowned sugar coating.
[211:29.10]Ha ha ha, Elden Ring.
[211:29.94]I'm gonna sneeze.
[211:31.62]Strawberry, do you remember that we ordered strawberries from the vegetable vendor?
[211:37.01]We ordered strawberries from the vegetable vendor.
[211:41.01]And you hid inside the box.
[211:44.17]You hid inside the box.
[211:47.39]And then, when we poured the strawberries into the pot...
[211:52.29]Yeah, the pot.
[211:55.63]When you were inside, you gobbled everything up and didn't leave anything for anyone else.
[212:01.57]Not even a drop.
[212:03.16]That sounds like Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
[212:05.08]If you do want to sugarcoat the cherry, we'll tell you the ingredients and you will prepare it yourself.
[212:11.70]UGH!
[212:12.12]UGH!
[212:37.34]Put the small magic wand that is outside the cupboard into the pot.
[212:42.57]The big magic wand.
[212:44.99]A magic wand.
[212:49.07]You can be sure.
[212:50.17]You have been shown.
[212:51.23]The secret of the coding will never be known.
[212:53.33]1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10.
[212:57.60]Now you have to start again.
[213:00.18]What?
[213:00.86]You said... Put the big magic wand that is outside the cupboard into the pot.
[213:05.06]Small.
[213:14.56]What are you talking about they said that didn't they say that they did it's the opposite Just shove them over and just take the fucking pot The big magic wand which is under the table, I thought you supposed to the opposite I
[213:32.10]So the big magic wand that's on top of the table.
[213:34.56]So it's the small magic wand that's on top of the table.
[213:42.12]It's the opposite.
[213:46.05]This is marvelous, Ronnie.
[213:48.61]We didn't let those two show-offs get the better of us.
[213:54.09]Put the big jar of honey that is on the table into the pot.
[213:59.98]Big jar of honey that's on the table, into the pot.
[214:02.60]Big jar of, small jar of honey, under the table, into the pot.
[214:10.85]Wait, what?
[214:15.77]Is this not it?
[214:16.23]Powdered flowers?
[214:23.02]You're losing viewers.
[214:23.94]No, I'm not.
[214:25.94]I went up like 5K in the last five minutes!
[214:30.88]What?
[214:31.04]That wasn't honey?
[214:31.98]What?
[214:32.62]I got it.
[215:06.45]So the big jar of honey that's inside the cupboard Small I need a small jar that's inside the cupboard No, no, I don't want this is a honey jar Yeah, that's a honey jar in every single video game.
[215:23.46]This is not a honey jar No, it's not that's not honey jar and every no I
[215:30.35]It's lip balm.
[215:31.99]What the fuck was the last thing he just said?
[215:36.75]Put the sugar that was outside the cupboard into the pot.
[215:41.71]Put the sugar inside the cupboard.
[215:43.43]That's correct, right?
[215:57.71]I'm not going anywhere!
[216:15.75]What the fuck they're so mean?
[216:45.71]who wants this I won't tell anyone of the secret I think it's fun I'm having a good time what is this it's all so stupid that I don't know what to think they say that I've discovered a secret what do they think that I have to appear on the cooking show or something I have to present a magic trick at a party real magic
[217:07.75]Who wanted this?
[217:08.81]A squirrel came up.
[217:10.19]Alright, I will make a deal with chat.
[217:11.29]If in the next 15 minutes I am not at the end game of this game, then I'll move on.
[217:39.01]Everybody was so pogchamp on Strawberry Magic until I actually want to play Strawberry Magic.
[217:44.36]Everybody's all pog until I play.
[217:48.54]It was all pogs.
[217:51.20]It was all pogs until I start doing puzzles.
[217:55.70]All right, how do I get out of here?
[218:08.35]It was all pogs until I actually played the game.
[218:11.06]Alright, you got 15 minutes.
[218:18.98]15 minutes and if it's not, I'm finishing it.
[218:20.72]Oh, wait a minute.
[218:23.63]It's a big deal.
[218:30.67]I'm streaming for like another three or four hours, don't worry.
[218:32.93]Run a poll to see who wants to see you finish it?
[218:34.83]Alright, fine, do it.
[218:53.60]Alright.
[218:55.01]Mods, run a poll to see if people want me to finish this.
[218:58.73]I guarantee you, a lot of you guys that say no, you're going to be very surprised, I think.
[219:07.41]I think you're going to be very surprised.
[219:13.59]Okay, I can't go in there.
[219:16.77]What is it at?
[219:27.28]There's a choo-choo train.
[219:32.00]It's a landslide.
[219:34.16]It's a landslide!
[219:36.08]Hold on, I need to save.
[219:36.92]I need to help.
[219:40.78]What a fucking landslide!
[219:43.20]What a landslide!
[219:45.40]Landslide!
[219:47.04]Oh no, no, no.
[219:49.23]That's a- what an absolute fucking landslide.
[219:53.31]Whoa, I actually was surprised.
[220:07.20]Holy shit, if I did that during Die Dallas, it'd be 90% no.
[220:10.19]I've succeeded in creating parts of an engine like none that have ever been seen in Magic Land.
[220:15.49]That's interesting.
[220:16.77]I think that when the engine is built according to this model, it will be the fastest ever made.
[220:20.82]But...
[220:25.52]let's go this is the train station what a huge and beautiful train is standing there in the distance I wonder what that professor is doing he's concentrating so hard
[220:40.42]15% of you just, like, bit your tongue.
[220:43.80]And, like, smashed your desk.
[220:45.46]80%!
[220:45.58]Oh!
[220:45.66]God!
[220:45.82]Are you gonna leave, though?
[220:46.92]I don't want you to.
[221:05.20]Hello, Strawberry.
[221:06.72]Today you haven't made me angry.
[221:08.79]I'm the happiest train designer in the world.
[221:11.01]I've just finished designing the parts of the model from which... Don't leave!
[221:14.45]We're just having fun, man.
[221:16.15]...a marvel of train engineering.
[221:18.21]To tell you the truth, though, when you're around, I do get a little worried.
[221:21.45]I'm sure that you've stolen some part of the model.
[221:24.26]No, sir.
[221:27.10]All the parts are on the table.
[221:31.59]Less than 25% voter turnout there.
[221:35.44]You had an opportunity.
[221:38.16]You were there.
[221:38.82]You could have said yes or no.
[221:40.50]I can't tell you to vote.
[221:48.45]Don't worry.
[221:48.95]To all the strawberry magic haters out there.
[221:53.26]I'm going to level with you.
[221:55.66]I'm gonna be done really soon, okay?
[221:57.00]I'm gonna be done very soon.
[221:58.70]Don't worry about it.
[221:59.76]It'll be alright.
[222:01.66]Trying to put all the parts together yourself?
[222:04.68]Well, let's just see whether you have the talent to be a real designer magician.
[222:09.39]We're now designer magicians.
[222:11.05]Okay.
[222:11.51]What does it look like?
[222:12.79]Great!
[222:13.65]This is fitting together perfectly!
[222:17.11]What does it look like?
[222:19.29]Oh, shit.
[222:19.80]Alright.
[222:20.36]Alright, I gotta go... Pink?
[222:26.55]Great!
[222:27.43]This is fitting together perfectly.
[222:29.41]And then that's the two Marines up here.
[222:35.55]No, that doesn't belong there.
[222:41.02]It does.
[222:41.90]Oh, I need the blue.
[222:43.86]The brain is rotting.
[222:44.78]I have some vitamins or something.
[222:48.31]A real wonder.
[222:54.06]Great!
[222:54.92]This is fitting together perfectly!
[223:00.19]Great!
[223:00.43]This is fitting together perfectly!
[223:01.65]Just go eat a banana and come back.
[223:03.97]You're not you when you're hungry, okay?
[223:10.69]No, Strawberry.
[223:11.78]Did you really think that it was so easy to design a train?
[223:14.72]Can you cosplay as a Strawberry Magic character?
[223:18.34]I wonder.
[223:19.34]I real wonder.
[223:20.50]I got like a Strawberry costume.
[223:26.83]No, that doesn't belong there.
[223:28.89]Was this right on the front?
[223:33.07]Yeah.
[223:33.23]This is a picture of the train model.
[223:40.96]I wonder.
[223:41.66]I did it.
[223:42.00]A real wonder.
[223:43.80]Stop playing this game.
[223:45.14]You just missed the 85% poll.
[223:49.86]It was 85% want to be to stay.
[223:53.62]To stay.
[223:56.45]85% said to stay.
[223:59.55]To stay.
[224:02.55]You had an opportunity to vote.
[224:04.33]And you missed it.
[224:09.05]Now what do we do?
[224:13.63]This is a picture of the train model.
[224:16.61]Now what?
[224:17.15]Now what?
[224:18.89]There's one piece left?
[224:19.85]Where?
[224:20.11]There's one more?
[224:23.89]What the fuck?
[224:26.79]This is a picture of the train model.
[224:28.63]Where is this piece?
[224:29.55]Oh my god, I thought that was Strawberry's head.
[224:33.63]I wonder.
[224:34.63]I real wonder.
[224:36.41]I am going to stay.
[224:38.35]Strawberry, although I did get angry at you when you stole the parts from here, I'm pleased now.
[224:44.04]It looks like you did learn something after all from playing with the parts I designed.
[224:48.34]Good for you.
[224:49.38]You can ride on my train anytime you want.
[224:54.69]Okay.
[224:56.07]Thank you.
[224:57.23]Now what?
[224:57.57]You're not gonna give me an item or anything?
[225:03.05]This is a picture of the train model.
[225:06.12]So, can I actually go on a train?
[225:08.17]Or is that it?
[225:08.81]What does this take us?
[225:46.74]Nice.
[225:46.90]Nice.
[226:12.36]I'm ready to help anyone who needs my very special talents.
[226:16.36]Do a recount.
[226:17.12]Okay.
[226:17.28]If you need help, I can help you.
[226:20.40]Let's do another poll.
[226:21.54]If you want me to stay and play Strawberry Magic.
[226:24.40]And if there are not at least 10,000 votes.
[226:26.84]I'm going to be pissed.
[226:32.53]Watch it be higher.
[226:36.85]I'm ready to help anyone who needs my very special talents.
[226:41.78]If you need help, I can help you.
[226:44.30]So help, I want help.
[226:49.16]Help me then.
[226:50.38]Magic dice cube.
[226:52.71]That's not what I have to give now.
[226:55.11]What do I have to give?
[226:55.69]Sugar.
[227:01.05]That's not what I have to give now.
[227:06.23]String.
[227:06.70]That's not what I have to give now.
[227:12.07]Okay, I don't think I can do this yet.
[227:15.73]Alright, that's all that's on the train.
[227:24.28]Four people vote.
[227:26.30]I gotta see it.
[227:26.98]Let's see it.
[227:31.34]Only three?
[227:31.82]Only four thousand votes?
[227:33.10]Let's go!
[227:43.58]What's going on here?
[227:44.36]I can imagine how mad the strawberry magic haters are right now.
[227:57.87]It's probably like, livid.
[228:01.33]It's like, I'm so mad.
[228:03.09]It needs to go on longer?
[228:16.65]All right, we got a kind of a weirdo here.
[228:21.63]Hello, Strawberry.
[228:22.63]Welcome to the forest of workers.
[228:24.63]Where are you headed?
[228:26.75]Forest of workers?
[228:28.97]What does that mean?
[228:30.81]What do they do here?
[228:34.29]You do ask silly questions, Ronnie.
[228:37.34]What do they do here?
[228:38.64]They work like horses.
[228:40.92]That's what they do here.
[228:42.02]What the fuck?
[228:42.66]This is so fucked up.
[228:44.41]Strawberry, don't look so innocent.
[228:46.55]You know very well what we do here.
[228:48.33]The problem is that you never like to come here and help us.
[228:51.77]Are you planning to bother us today, too?
[228:54.65]No, I don't intend bothering you at all.
[228:56.71]I'm searching for the magic.
[229:00.08]It's amazing.
[229:00.88]I really need a lot of help, and here it is.
[229:02.94]From the most unexpected direction.
[229:05.20]I have to sow a hundred pepper worker seeds, but I can't find the house where the seeds are.
[229:11.12]I'll help you.
[229:12.36]Which house are you looking for?
[229:13.70]What is this poll?
[229:15.52]I'm looking for the house which is under the blue house and behind the blue house.
[229:21.00]Under the blue house and behind the blue house.
[229:23.74]Got it.
[229:26.95]Great.
[229:27.59]This is the house.
[229:28.93]Now I'll be able to grow pepper workers from the seeds.
[229:32.03]Thank you, Strawberry.
[229:33.05]I'm really happy that you've changed.
[229:39.21]Now what?
[229:39.89]What does that do?
[229:41.38]What does that do for us?
[229:42.86]We just get like a bad ending?
[229:45.52]I don't know.
[229:46.88]I don't get it.
[229:47.70]Ew.
[230:03.50]Good morning, Strawberry.
[230:05.24]You got up early.
[230:06.88]Still trying to get out of doing any work, huh?
[230:10.36]Get out of work?
[230:12.13]Oh no!
[230:13.21]What made you think that?
[230:15.03]Just the opposite.
[230:16.71]I'm interested in working today.
[230:18.63]I've already worked for the Pepper and he even sends you his regards.
[230:22.60]Do you need any help?
[230:24.08]And your histograms.
[230:24.52]Elastis.
[230:24.78]A hundred corn workers?
[230:26.66]What does it say?
[230:55.04]I'll help you.
[230:56.32]Which house are you looking for?
[230:59.28]I'm looking for the house that is behind the house that is under the red flower.
[231:06.27]The corn asks easy questions that have very hard answers.
[231:09.81]Okay, shut up.
[231:11.73]Sit the fuck down and shut up.
[231:13.98]What was it?
[231:14.68]It's under the house behind the house.
[231:20.21]Wonderful.
[231:21.09]That's the house.
[231:22.35]Now I can sow the corn seeds.
[231:24.47]Goodbye, and give my warmest regards to Mr. Cucumber.
[231:28.11]What?
[231:33.06]She's causing so much trouble in this town.
[231:36.18]Every single person I've met, every single one, is like, oh, Strawberry, you're here to, like, fuck up my business?
[231:44.01]Every single person.
[231:53.50]Alright, there's probably one more.
[231:59.73]What?
[232:06.35]What do you mean, what am I talking about?
[232:09.05]We've been watching this strawberry magic person over here.
[232:12.95]Now, wait, what?
[232:17.52]What happened?
[232:19.46]No, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[232:20.80]Did I miss a puzzle?
[232:23.22]I didn't get anything for doing this.
[232:24.26]Is there another one?
[232:29.18]I don't... I don't... What do you want me to do?
[232:34.49]I didn't get an item for this.
[232:35.41]Should I have gone left again?
[232:42.15]I went left for the corner.
[232:47.36]I didn't think I could go left again.
[232:54.77]Guys, help.
[232:56.23]What's the name of that song?
[232:58.95]I've been trying to figure it out for a long time, but I cannot for the life of me find it.
[233:02.39]The one that goes... It was in like a shitload of YouTuber videos.
[233:06.54]What was it called?
[233:22.01]It's called Oh My Fucking God Hello.
[233:24.87]I know that you have a lot of work, and I don't want to disturb you, but I'm looking for the magic.
[233:30.37]Can you help me?
[233:32.82]Of course I can help you.
[233:34.64]Do you know the magic that will help me find the house that I'm looking for?
[233:38.60]I have to sow cucumber worker seeds right away, but I can't find them.
[233:42.88]Show me the house where the seeds are hidden.
[233:46.76]Okay, I'll do it.
[233:49.07]I've been looking for this song for a long time.
[233:50.25]I'm looking for the purple house above the rock.
[233:53.94]Ooh, I wonder where that is.
[233:54.92]Looking for the purple house above the rock.
[233:59.84]Mike, turn your head.
[234:05.94]Wonderful.
[234:07.16]You have found my seeds.
[234:09.75]Real magic.
[234:11.35]I'm rushing off to work.
[234:12.75]Give my regards to Ms.
[234:14.09]Red Pepper.
[234:15.25]So long.
[234:17.08]Cat did good.
[234:17.56]Can we have a reward?
[234:18.34]Sure.
[234:21.32]What was the reward?
[234:24.99]I didn't get anything.
[234:25.57]I don't understand.
[234:29.11]Everyone I ask about the magic asks me to help him.
[234:32.66]Even when I do help, I don't get an answer from them.
[234:35.64]I hope you're right, Strawberry, and that I can find some magic here to show at the party.
[234:44.43]This is a child's game?
[234:45.31]Yeah, well, I mean, where are we going?
[234:48.19]Apple?
[234:49.33]This has got to be the end.
[235:00.69]Yo, Strawberry.
[235:02.43]How did you get here?
[235:04.09]You know that you are very near to the clearing in the forest, and only those who are good at magic are allowed in this part of the forest.
[235:11.98]Uh-oh.
[235:12.60]Tell me, you naughty boy, did you find some secret detour around Harry the Corn and Mr. Green the Cucumber?
[235:19.38]No, not at all.
[235:20.54]I took the main road and helped each of them.
[235:22.74]It's been 15 minutes.
[235:23.52]Add another 20.
[235:24.46]I'm really surprised.
[235:26.64]What happened, Strawberry, that you decided to help?
[235:29.77]Have you decided to become a magician?
[235:33.03]Yes, I've been looking for the magic all day.
[235:34.96]Somebody was very mad, I'm sorry.
[235:35.96]Maybe you can help me.
[235:38.54]Of course I can.
[235:40.14]Here, Magic Land needs a large workforce every day.
[235:43.95]My friends, Cucumber, Pepper, and Corn are already busy with preparations.
[235:48.63]They also sow worker seeds.
[235:51.03]I have the job of preparing a workforce for emergencies.
[235:54.72]Abra put the seeds in one of the houses, and according to his description, I'm having trouble finding the right one.
[236:03.70]Strawberry, come on, wake up!
[236:06.58]Strawberry's been asleep.
[236:10.68]Oh, I'm sure I told you.
[236:12.58]Keep on looking.
[236:14.10]You have no choice.
[236:15.41]If someone asks for your help, you have to help them.
[236:18.37]And that's that.
[236:19.21]There's no such thing as magic.
[236:21.27]She just found this innocent kid.
[236:22.99]And said, oh, hey, come and do all my work and chores for me.
[236:28.85]I'm looking for the red house above the red flower.
[236:36.36]Great!
[236:37.30]It's real magic, Strawberry!
[236:39.34]I'm rushing off to sow my seeds!
[236:41.56]Bye!
[236:42.46]Give my regards to Eggplant, don't forget now!
[236:45.24]No, I- somebody- just give me an item so I can leave!
[236:53.25]You see, Strawberry?
[236:54.55]Mrs. Redpepper is just like all the rest!
[236:57.03]She only wants me to help her and didn't give me even a clue as to where to find the magic!
[237:03.45]listen to me ronnie aubergine lives in a very important part of the forest it's the most carefully guarded place before the clearing in the forest hey his magic is very special interesting all right we're gonna get a spell I think we're gonna get a spell I think
[237:34.23]Hey, you, don't bother me again today.
[237:36.63]You're the last one I want to see here.
[237:38.56]Go away.
[237:39.68]What is it?
[237:40.10]Is it a hot dog or an eggplant?
[237:43.84]What did you do to Aubergine that is so angry at you and is chasing me away?
[237:49.96]Well, uh, you see, uh, yesterday I was very hungry, and I thought all day about the wonderful apples that Aubergine grows.
[237:59.83]I asked him for one, but of course Aubergine does not give apples to anyone who doesn't help him.
[238:05.83]So, I offered to help him pick the apples, and I really did pick them, but, uh, after they were already in my bag, I...
[238:13.97]really didn't feel like it why is so many people have such a vicious reaction to strawberry magic you know what strawberry I'm having fun in strawberry magic wherever I go as soon as I get there I have to suffer because of the mischief you have gotten yourself into nobody likes me here and it's all your fault you wanted to come here so don't complain go back to mr aubergine he really isn't as bad as he looks
[238:43.21]Just, what house do you want me to do?

[238:52.77]It's not real.

[239:05.60]No way.

[240:07.90]A service cart, huh?
[240:10.82]Excuse me, sir?
[240:14.35]What's on the ground?
[240:15.79]Just a minute, don't disturb me.
[240:18.25]For sale, an electric range, a pair of chairs.
[240:24.41]Excuse me, sir.
[240:27.22]Strawberry, I'm tired of your pranks.
[240:30.24]This time, I won't give in.
[240:32.00]This time, you have to reveal to me how you managed to sneak into the forest every time without anyone's noticing you.
[240:38.27]This is the most carefully guarded place in Magic Land, and you're not allowed to run around here.
[240:44.29]why what are you guarding here all I see here are lots and lots of furrows nothing else rich to read us according to legend the great book of magic is buried here really was hidden hundreds of years ago oh my god nobody knows for certain where it was buried because the enchanted compass rose which points to where it is has been lost
[241:05.93]And to this day, no one has found it.
[241:08.97]Abra, the great magician, is willing to give anything to anyone who can give him the book which has all the lost secrets of the magical magic land.
[241:18.29]And whoever has the compass rose in his possession can find the ancient book.
[241:24.42]Of course, but the compass rose itself is not enough.
[241:27.74]We also have to find the ball that will fly us high above the clearing in the forest and move in the directions that the compass rose shows us.
[241:35.87]Okay.
[241:38.69]Alright, I don't have that.
[241:39.65]Alright, I don't have that.
[241:42.02]I don't have that.
[241:42.90]I don't have that.
[241:43.48]I don't have that.
[241:44.30]Hey.
[241:44.40]Hey.
[242:00.52]When you have both items you need to find the book, we'll look for it together.
[242:04.59]Goodbye, Strawberry.
[242:09.57]Harsh.
[242:11.81]Alright, get me out of here.
[242:13.89]I'll come back.
[242:14.97]Alright, I'm giving it ten minutes.
[242:16.01]That was a growl?
[242:17.89]No, it wasn't.
[242:20.46]Strawberry.
[242:21.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[242:22.52]I'm almost there.
[242:23.02]I'm almost there.
[242:23.42]I'm almost there.
[242:23.80]I promise I'm almost there.
[242:24.46]I promise I'm almost there.
[242:26.68]Everyone relax.
[242:29.42]Give me something to say in the low voice.
[242:30.56]I'll do it.
[242:31.06]I'll make everybody happy.
[242:33.15]Give me something to say.
[242:34.31]Give me something to say.
[242:35.29]I'll say it in the low voice.
[242:57.94]At least.
[242:59.70]Strawberry.
[243:05.40]Avocado?
[243:08.00]Did I tell you that I was laughing my ass off the other day?
[243:11.43]Because I just kept thinking of the Voldemort Homer Simpson comment.
[243:16.61]And that video, that like, the video was playing in my head over and over again.
[243:22.29]I was fucking dying.
[243:28.08]Alright, what do I need to do?
[243:29.50]I need to go to the magic school.
[243:32.22]I need a wand, a magic wand.
[243:43.86]I might move on.
[243:45.32]I might give in.
[243:46.26]Because I don't know what to do now.
[243:49.88]Does this count as a magic wand?
[243:51.60]I don't know what to do.
[243:55.56]I'm stuck.
[243:58.42]I feel like I'm so close.
[243:59.26]I'm so close.
[244:04.45]I need something to open the nectar lid.
[244:06.35]I need... Will the dice open the magician door?
[244:10.57]I need the red paint.
[244:23.80]Yeah, I need red paint.
[244:25.66]I don't know where the fuck anything even is here, man.
[244:28.66]I don't think I even went down this way.
[244:30.90]Did I?
[244:31.18]No, this is where the bridge is.
[244:34.04]What's across the bridge?
[244:40.10]Alright.
[244:41.06]I need to open that nectar, but I don't think I can.
[244:43.41]I need another item.
[244:47.25]This is the construction.
[244:48.79]I got this already.
[244:49.95]I don't know.
[244:55.24]Try the dice.
[244:56.88]Would the dice work on that magic building?
[245:02.71]Hold on.
[245:05.43]Does the lollipop count as a magic wand?
[245:07.03]I feel like it's a kid's game.
[245:08.89]It might.
[245:13.62]He doesn't want a sugar-coated cherry.
[245:17.23]Ice on the nectar?
[245:19.93]You kidding me?
[245:20.85]That's right.
[245:29.23]People are commenting on a walkthrough on YouTube.
[245:31.33]God.
[245:31.81]We have about three hours left to finish this.
[245:37.41]What?
[245:48.71]Magic dice.
[245:49.77]You can't open the barrel with that.
[245:51.75]Why?
[245:52.05]A sugar-coated chair.
[245:55.93]You can't open the barrel with that.
[245:59.25]Come on.
[246:00.15]What do we do?
[246:01.51]Magic dice.
[246:02.63]That won't help you open the door.
[246:04.57]We can open any door.
[246:05.57]Oh, come on.
[246:07.65]I don't want to get stuck here.
[246:08.71]It looks like I can't get past the pit.
[246:11.76]How awful.
[246:12.76]I have a legit question.
[246:13.80]Why are you still playing?
[246:14.86]Because I'm invested and I want to know what happens.
[246:27.70]They're dev... Painter for paint.
[246:31.82]Alright.
[246:36.73]Ice on magic school.
[246:40.15]I can't get in there without a wand.
[246:41.39]Alright.
[246:44.29]Alright.
[246:45.53]Alright.
[246:46.36]Alright.
[246:47.96]Alright.
[246:50.73]Alright.
[246:51.13]Alright.
[246:51.93]Alright.
[246:52.35]Alright.
[246:52.77]Alright.
[246:53.17]Alright.
[247:19.56]That's it.
[247:20.00]Alright, that's it.
[247:20.52]There's the cake.
[247:30.33]Alright.
[247:34.61]There are two Let's Plays of this that exist.
[247:42.44]Alright!
[247:45.34]But I want to know.
[247:46.14]I want to finish it.
[247:48.86]Where do I wish I go?
[247:49.60]I have this picture.
[247:51.50]I need to get into the magic school.
[247:53.18]I have this necklace for somebody.
[247:54.54]Who is the necklace for?
[247:56.75]I don't know.
[248:00.63]All right.
[248:06.05]Painter.
[248:06.91]All right.
[248:14.57]The candy store is closed today.
[248:16.35]What?
[248:16.77]Open it up.
[248:19.53]Magic dice cube.
[248:21.07]All right.
[248:22.07]All right, that's it.
[248:23.59]All right.
[248:25.13]Magic dice cube.
[248:47.02]You can't go in there without permission from Abra.
[248:50.23]What a shame.
[248:51.01]I was born here.
[248:55.59]Magic dice cube.
[248:57.61]I think I'm stuck.
[249:14.72]I might have to give up here in a second.
[249:16.01]I really think I have to give up.
[249:20.89]We've lost about 10% by the way.
[249:22.53]10% have shifted over to the move on side.
[249:27.63]That's a full 10%.
[249:33.64]Starting to lose more people.
[249:35.64]Alright, people were like, yeah, let's go!
[249:39.97]Fuck the strawberry magic haters!
[249:41.60]10% of you changed your mind in the last 20 minutes.
[249:44.46]I'm like, yeah, you know what?
[249:47.98]Actually, fuck this game.
[249:48.90]We should do something else.
[249:54.92]Paint?
[249:55.20]Alright, I'm gonna get the red paint.
[249:59.25]I'm not kidding.
[250:01.55]If I am not at the end of this game, in exactly 15 minutes,
[250:08.88]I'll quit.
[250:09.70]I promise.
[250:10.18]I need red paint.
[250:10.78]Oh!
[250:35.77]Hi, sir.
[250:36.71]Thank you very much.
[250:38.73]Oh.
[250:39.93]Oh.
[250:40.69]What?
[250:42.53]Alright, red paint.
[250:43.95]Now we have to go to that construction place.
[250:46.58]Which I forget where that is.
[250:48.64]Help me.
[250:49.14]Please.
[250:49.92]Help me.
[250:50.68]Over here.
[250:52.26]Construction.
[250:52.78]Red paint.
[250:53.42]Get an item.
[250:53.98]We're good.
[250:57.83]We're going for it.
[250:58.99]I'll be there in 15 minutes.
[251:01.91]Well, have you brought a can of red paint?
[251:06.27]The color red.
[251:09.98]We're back.
[251:13.18]Well, where did you get the red paint?
[251:15.44]I placed the order for it a long time ago and never got it.
[251:19.12]I must produce all this furniture in this color.
[251:23.80]Now that you have a second, I'd like to ask you if you know the secret of the magic.
[251:30.21]There is no secret.
[251:30.73]What?
[251:30.87]Lever.
[251:30.99]What's a lever?
[251:31.55]Lever.
[251:31.72]Okay.
[251:31.90]Let's do it.
[252:03.01]It's going to take forever.
[252:03.91]I'm trying to turn it now.
[252:06.53]What the fuck?
[252:32.10]I need to go down again.
[252:38.01]Fuck you!
[252:57.58]Ugh!
[253:06.73]Now that's better.
[253:08.01]I think I crashed the game.
[253:18.19]Strawberry, if you don't help me saw the board, I won't have time to prepare the item you need in order to get closer to finding the magic.
[253:26.26]Go over to the board which is on the table.
[253:28.74]This is making my brain itchy.
[253:32.24]I got it.
[253:32.64]Okay, get to work, Strawberry.
[253:34.54]Perform the magic.
[253:37.74]Why is this magic?
[253:38.72]It's a saw.
[253:40.86]This actually sucks.
[253:44.94]Okay, I have an idea.
[253:51.87]I have to put the saw up there first, Strawberry.
[253:55.01]You know what?
[253:55.39]Have fun in your lounge chair.
[254:14.33]This is gonna be fucking impossible I don't see any line here.
[254:26.12]Oh My god, oh my god, oh
[254:45.60]Hey, you're not in the right direction.
[254:48.20]Now that's better.
[255:05.10]I'm not on it.
[255:07.66]Okay, you are on it when there's one pixel block on the white.
[255:15.19]No, that's wrong.
[255:19.19]You are on it when there's- yeah.
[255:21.91]What the fuck is happening right now?
[255:28.05]Excuse me?
[255:30.87]What?
[255:32.94]How do I get this correct?
[255:46.03]Hey, you're not in the right direction.
[255:48.45]I can only go so far.
[256:00.03]Now that's better.
[256:15.84]Who cares?
[256:42.14]Strawberry, you managed to saw this complicated shape very well.
[256:47.16]In just a moment, I'll paint it red.
[256:49.58]But in the meantime, take this very useful screwdriver.
[256:55.61]This is just great.
[256:57.45]The board is painted red and I have a little time.
[257:00.91]So let's go prepare something for you that will bring you a lot closer to the magic.
[257:08.95]I'm making a magic wand for you.
[257:11.14]When you have it, you must show it to everyone.
[257:14.50]And then they will know that you honestly want to become a real magician.
[257:19.30]I'll fit the guiding star onto the top of the wand.
[257:23.18]The guiding star will prove that you have already been to a place from which the secret of the magic can be seen.
[257:31.83]Do you have the guiding star?
[257:34.38]If you do, give it to me, and I'll finish making you your magic wand.
[257:41.50]A sugar-coated cherry.
[257:45.18]That's not what I have to give now.
[257:46.92]Why walk all the way over there?
[257:48.72]You little shit.
[257:49.74]All right, get out.
[257:50.30]A sugar-coated... I don't have the guiding star.
[257:54.17]I'll try and get one.
[257:56.95]All right.
[257:57.94]I'll wait for you here.
[257:58.98]All right.
[257:59.18]Nectar.
[257:59.52]Good luck.
[258:00.68]The star's gonna be down there.
[258:02.24]Magical school.
[258:04.14]Find who stole the thing.
[258:06.22]We're getting close.
[258:08.16]It's been 15 minutes.
[258:08.76]No, it hasn't.
[258:15.05]Okay.
[258:15.53]I need to go to the door.
[258:17.83]Open the lid.
[258:18.43]Have the guy fly me to the magical kingdom.
[258:21.23]I gotta remember where that is.
[258:28.56]Okay, where the fuck is that magical thing?
[258:31.79]Where is it?
[258:32.19]I don't know where it is.
[258:34.69]Up and right?
[258:43.82]Fuck the haters.
[258:44.97]There's no ha- people are just messing around.
[258:47.88]I mean, there's probably, okay, there are 17,000 people here.
[258:50.61]I imagine at least 100 of them.
[258:54.71]I'm probably unfollowing the channel at this point.
[258:56.55]They probably hate me now.
[258:57.67]Because they hate this game.
[258:59.09]I'm sorry.
[258:59.57]I'm actually, I'm sorry.
[259:00.63]I wish I could say something to you.
[259:02.83]I'm sorry.
[259:03.53]I just, but I have to, I have to get over, I have to do it.
[259:07.21]Sorry.
[259:12.44]Alright, let's go.
[259:14.40]There's only a toilet.
[259:15.66]What's going on with his eyes?
[259:19.50]Good thing I've got a fucking magical cube.
[259:23.24]Shut up.
[259:43.58]This guy was lying the whole time.
[259:44.94]I need a magic disc.
[259:45.72]I just gave this guy drugs and that's all that happened.
[259:49.72]Now what?
[259:49.90]Now what?
[259:50.18]I don't understand what happens now.
[259:52.35]I need a magic disc.
[260:14.32]The lid?
[260:19.68]No, it's not.
[260:20.62]It's not the lid.
[260:26.60]It looks like I can't get past the pit.
[260:29.66]How awful.
[260:33.95]Shit.
[260:35.07]Dip the lollipop in the nectar?
[260:38.15]Shit.
[260:43.67]Stuck again.
[260:47.41]Give the candy to the weird, I don't know, what are you saying, weird guy?
[260:50.89]Give a lollipop to the monster.
[261:03.54]Wait, the gobble guy?
[261:04.82]Will he actually eat this?
[261:16.91]Do another poll.
[261:17.33]Yeah, do another poll.
[261:24.69]I'm curious to see how much people are losing patience every like 15 minutes.
[261:31.31]I'm waiting for it to swing the other direction and the majority say no.
[261:35.35]This is actually funny.
[261:38.58]I like this.
[261:43.33]Okay, here.
[261:43.79]Yes.
[261:44.09]God damn it, I can't.
[261:44.93]I can't feed it to him.
[261:46.20]I can't feed it to him.
[261:52.18]Alright, this is bad.
[261:52.98]I actually am stuck.
[262:17.11]The guy at the bridge?
[262:18.17]The guy at the bridge, I don't... I don't think he's gonna want it.
[262:20.51]The bridge guy?
[262:21.15]Go to the warehouse.
[262:24.49]Necklace to the... That's right.
[262:27.57]Alright, what have we got for percentage?
[262:35.66]Percentage, what is it?
[262:36.30]73% losing.
[262:37.32]It was 77 before.
[262:37.84]Uh-oh.
[262:59.01]73% still majority, it is.
[262:59.69]God damn it.
[263:00.01]Do you want this candy or something?
[263:02.83]Uhhh...
[263:28.37]I need the library key scroll from the painter.
[263:33.80]Go to the library.
[263:35.62]Library key scroll.
[263:41.20]Where do I get that?
[263:41.82]70% is enough?
[263:44.54]Okay, every 10 minutes we're going to do the poll.
[263:47.16]If it drops below 65%, I will leave.
[264:03.37]So you're back.
[264:04.65]You probably want to go into the library.
[264:07.15]I'm pleased to invite you to go.
[264:09.39]You worked hard and you deserve it.
[264:11.81]We need to stay strong, guys.
[264:14.17]I'm just saying.
[264:15.59]If that drops below 65%, I'm out of here.
[264:17.55]Is there dice in here?
[264:23.81]I still haven't found the secret hidden in the book.
[264:27.24]I'll try again.
[264:28.14]Go to the train.
[264:30.94]Magic dice cube.
[264:32.40]Fuck.
[264:36.93]It's the library code.
[264:37.95]Scroll.
[264:38.21]There's a scroll under the easel.
[264:39.89]Help me, help me, help me!
[264:41.55]Oh, I thought that was what the easel was on.
[264:44.36]I thought that was a piece of wood.
[264:46.48]Oh.
[265:00.13]One of the books in my library contains a great secret.
[265:03.71]The code with which you will find the book that has this secret is on the scroll.
[265:08.58]Take the code with you.
[265:15.86]I thought that was a piece of wood holding the easel up.
[265:17.44]Alright, strawberry friends!
[265:22.44]We're getting closer!
[265:23.06]I still haven't found the secret hidden in the book.
[265:26.36]I'll try again.
[265:32.88]From time to time, another book will be lit up on the scroll.
[265:36.42]You must find its place in the library and click on it exactly.
[265:39.97]I will.
[265:41.41]Oh, no, next time.
[265:42.23]You guys, I'm telling you, under 65%, I'm Alt-F4ing.

[267:05.57]The great book of magic.
[267:08.19]All the magic tricks in the world are in that book.
[267:11.59]Legend has it that it was written by the father of all magicians thousands of years ago.
[267:17.30]But everyone thinks that it has been lost.
[267:20.84]Take the compass and use it to help find the ancient book.
[267:25.99]They'll love you in magic land.
[267:30.92]Maybe I'll find a small and easy magic trick in the book.
[267:35.71]I'll take the compass rose.
[267:37.99]Hurry up and take it.
[267:40.65]This is a very strange ball.
[267:42.46]It doesn't bounce like a regular ball.
[267:44.66]I'll take it with me.
[267:45.58]Okay.
[267:47.02]So I've got, this is the thing that I put on top of the magic wand, right?

[271:07.86]Wonderful.
[271:08.76]Now we have both the ball and the compass rose and we can start our search.
[271:11.90]75%.
[271:12.54]Climb onto the ball and I'll kick you upwards.
[271:14.74]When you're up there, you'll be able to see the furrows.
[271:17.19]The compass rose will guide you.
[271:19.45]Pay attention.
[271:20.51]You must begin from the blue dot.
[271:22.69]That's my hat.
[271:23.81]That way you'll know where I am.
[271:25.43]Alright.
[271:26.77]He just kicked me.
[271:32.53]Oh my god.
[271:33.63]What the hell is this?
[271:37.04]It's your stream?
[271:38.46]I love this, it's fun!
[271:53.46]Now, listen very carefully.
[271:55.52]You must look at the blue dot.
[271:57.42]That's me.
[271:58.48]And move in the direction I tell you.
[272:00.83]You must move only one dot at a time.
[272:03.67]The enchanted compass rose will guide us and we'll reach the place where the book has been hidden.
[272:09.19]Move one dot to the upper left.
[272:12.05]Okay, how do I do that?
[272:15.47]How do I do that?
[272:16.15]No, that's not the proper direction.
[272:23.13]He said upper left, dude.
[272:25.30]Wonderful.
[272:25.94]Oh.
[272:27.26]Move one dot to the left.
[272:30.60]Great.
[272:31.14]We're on the right track.
[272:33.54]Move one dot downward.
[272:35.13]I can't.
[272:37.99]I can't go down there.
[272:39.39]Very good.
[272:41.83]Move one dot to the right.
[272:45.45]That's it.
[272:46.37]That's the correct dot.
[272:48.76]Move one dot to the right.
[272:50.98]We just did a circle.
[272:52.19]Great, we're on the right track.
[272:55.19]Move one dot to the upper right.
[272:59.43]I'll come down on this star.
[273:02.51]Everybody, all you fucking assholes that told me to click the star.
[273:12.44]Why have you come down?
[273:14.12]You almost found the most important book in the world.
[273:16.85]Strawberry, I just don't understand you.
[273:20.04]Send me back up.
[273:20.70]I'll go back up.
[273:21.26]Send me back up.
[273:21.76]This has been unbearable.
[273:22.78]I'm having a great time.
[273:23.52]80% of the people here watching disagree with you.
[273:24.98]Very good!
[273:50.83]Move one dot to the right.
[273:54.29]Wonderful.
[273:56.25]Move one dot to the upper left.
[273:57.33]The Berry Bros are very strong right now.
[274:00.07]Great.
[274:00.61]We're on the right track.
[274:03.03]Move one dot upward.
[274:06.33]Wonderful.
[274:08.30]Move one dot to the left.
[274:09.62]This fucking sucks.
[274:11.70]Very good.
[274:12.52]When I finish, I'll be the only person in the last ten years to play this game and beat it.
[274:18.14]Great.
[274:18.68]We're on the right track.
[274:21.17]Move one dot to the upper right.
[274:23.37]We're at the end game now.
[274:25.05]Great.
[274:25.59]We're on the right track.
[274:26.68]I promise I'll go back to Jeopardy.
[274:27.68]I will.
[274:28.02]Move one dot to the upper left.
[274:32.48]Very good.
[274:34.94]Move one dot to the right.
[274:38.32]Very good.
[274:40.75]Move one dot upward.
[274:42.45]I'm going to get the magic book.
[274:44.17]Strawberry, I see something interesting on the ground.
[274:47.01]Catch a star right away and come down on it.
[274:48.87]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

[275:11.31]I have the book.
[275:12.75]That's it.
[275:13.05]I beat it.
[275:13.45]It's over.
[275:14.23]I have the magic book.
[275:15.18]I can get the magic wand.
[275:15.92]This is it.
[275:16.30]This is it.
[275:35.66]Take the star to the magic wand.
[275:37.46]Get the magic wand made.
[275:39.00]Take that to the school.

[275:41.23]Finish the school.
[275:42.07]Bring that book to Abracadabra.
[275:45.23]And then see the final cutscene.
[275:46.23]And it's over.
[275:46.71]And we win.
[275:47.05]This is it.
[275:54.67]You need to do Rani's ending.
[275:59.91]Who was the person that made the... It's a construction place.
[276:02.95]That's fair, right?
[276:12.85]I'll speed it up, don't worry.
[276:13.63]And then we go to the academy.
[276:17.47]I do.
[276:23.35]Do the Lord of the Frenzied Berry ending.
[276:36.84]We're so close.

[277:26.43]Where was the school?
[277:30.60]We're always so close, man.
[277:31.80]I'm telling you, we're so close.
[277:34.30]It's this way, right?
[277:37.60]And then up across the bridge.

[278:42.51]So, if you pass the entrance examination, you'll be allowed to go in.
[278:47.45]I'll soon test to see if you have the talent to become a magician.
[278:53.70]I'll show you one card, then I'll turn it back.
[278:56.60]With the fast movement of all great magicians, I will then replace the cards.
[279:01.56]Then, you will have to tell me where the card you first saw is.
[279:06.52]That was the game.
[279:09.26]80%.
[279:09.36]Come on.

[297:19.26]Somebody threw a bomb in the ring.
[297:21.10]What the fuck?
[297:39.21]That was insane.
[297:40.33]What are the controls?
[297:44.19]Alright, stop throwing grenades into the ring.
[297:46.05]That would be great.
[297:46.77]Who is that?
[298:01.80]One more try.
[298:06.28]I'm pressing every button on the keyboard and nothing does anything.
[298:46.21]I crashed my computer.
[299:16.87]Let's go!
[299:48.79]The magic is back.
[299:52.85]The magic returns.
[299:56.25]I got the magic book.
[299:57.61]So what do I have to give this person?
[300:00.09]Magic never left.
[300:03.07]You are skyrocketing.
[300:16.70]What?
[300:16.96]Oh my god.
[300:17.67]I was at like 17k.
[300:19.81]I'm at 80,000 viewers now.
[300:22.21]The word must have gotten out that the magic has returned.
[300:25.49]Word must have gotten out.
[300:29.44]Is it the necklace?
[300:30.68]I don't think so.
[300:31.18]Ooh, nice.
[300:45.27]This one piece of the puzzle I'm missing here.
[300:48.43]I'm just taking a walk.
[300:50.13]Goodbye.
[300:53.03]Remember the CNN part?
[300:54.37]Oh, yeah.
[300:56.63]Guy like walking around grabbing his chair.
[300:58.27]I know that I have pretended to die.
[301:00.13]I forgot that was the same stream.
[301:06.37]That was fucking hilarious, by the way.
[301:13.67]So...
[301:16.00]Where do I go?
[301:16.54]Not the forest.
[301:17.95]Go to Abra's house.
[301:20.39]There was nothing I could do here, though.
[301:41.46]Best Scream 2022?
[301:43.59]I don't know about that.
[301:44.35]I'm having fun, but you know.
[301:45.57]Oh, here we go.
[301:45.99]Let's go.
[301:46.35]Let's go.
[301:46.79]Let's go.
[301:47.11]Let's go.
[301:47.73]Time for the ending cinematic.
[301:51.21]Huh?
[302:03.86]Ronnie, he doesn't know who Ronnie is.
[302:05.93]This is no time to mix things up.
[302:08.87]You are really me.
[302:10.52]You're Strawberry now.
[302:11.94]It's me, Strawberry.
[302:17.36]Oh, brisket.
[302:17.92]Got it right here.
[302:18.82]Ayyup.
[302:39.79]And I got his hat too, so this is perfect.
[303:04.27]Strawberry, now that I've met you and have seen what you're able to do, I think differently about the strawberry workers.
[303:11.84]You have never shown any interest in the secret of magic.
[303:15.24]You spent your time on childish pranks and silly jokes and didn't learn anything.
[303:20.54]And now, wonder of wonders, it was you of all who has brought me back the book where all the best-kept secrets of magic are written.
[303:29.00]Tell me, Strawberry, what happened to change you so?
[303:35.54]Just listen to the old grump who always kicked me out.
[303:39.72]Just listen to how sweet he sounds now.
[303:43.50]Because you're helping.
[303:44.44]You're not just sitting on a lounge chair.
[303:47.55]I know that you never liked me, but I've changed now.
[303:51.23]And I really would like to learn the secret of magic.
[303:55.77]What magic would you like to learn?
[303:57.69]I get to pick?
[304:00.47]You must learn the magic of the three items.
[304:03.15]Sure.
[304:06.82]I want to learn how to... You listen to this motherfucker.
[304:13.15]Really?
[304:14.11]The magic of the three items?
[304:16.30]That's the most difficult magic of all.
[304:18.38]Necromancy.
[304:19.08]It takes a lot of hard work to get hold of the three magic items.
[304:23.34]Strawberry, you've taken a very serious task upon yourself, and I'm ready to help you.
[304:28.85]Remember, if you bring me the three magic items, which no one except me has succeeded in getting, I'll teach you the secret.
[304:36.69]The magic lollipop, the magic dice, the magic hat.
[304:38.87]The title of Master of Master Magicians.
[304:42.88]What do you need?
[304:43.24]What are the three magic items?
[304:47.38]That I won't tell you.
[304:49.36]I can only say that I don't have them.
[304:52.08]Once, I found them too, and that's how I became the best magician in the world.
[304:56.91]If you bring me the three magic items, I promise you I will teach you the secret of magic, and you will be called the best magician.
[305:05.63]Did you know I'm the only magician that can get out of a locked box?
[305:10.21]Watch.
[305:11.03]I'll jump into the box.
[305:12.73]You'll lock it.
[305:13.87]And in half a jiffy, I'll be out.
[305:16.08]Is there oxygen in there?
[305:16.94]This guy's gonna die.
[305:18.66]Uh... Are we gonna- Is this guy gonna die in here?
[305:35.37]Oh, don't do that!
[305:38.04]This guy was just trashed.
[305:40.90]What do you want me to do?
[306:05.98]Strawberry, I still can't get out of here.
[306:12.63]Strawberry, quick, get me out of here.
[306:14.83]I'm choking.
[306:15.35]Leave him in here?
[306:16.75]I'm choking?
[306:18.55]Strawberry, quick, get me out of here.
[306:20.95]I'm choking.
[306:27.78]Strawberry, quick, get me out of here.
[306:30.20]I'm choking.
[306:32.76]Why did you go in?
[306:34.30]Magic dice cube.
[306:35.58]Why did he go in?
[306:37.24]Strawberry, I still can't get out of here.
[306:39.82]How do I open it?
[306:43.46]Well, what do you want?
[306:44.12]Of course I'm laughing.
[306:45.10]This is ridiculous.
[306:46.29]The guy's like, ah, come and bring me three magical items.
[306:50.51]I don't know what they are, but go find them.
[306:52.97]By the way, I'm going to trap myself in a box that I can't get out of and die from suffocation.
[306:58.23]Excuse me?
[306:58.77]What do you want me to do here?
[307:00.41]Strawberry, quick, get me out of here.
[307:02.82]I'm choking.
[307:03.46]I need a puzzle piece?
[307:07.94]This dude's dead.
[307:08.84]Don't go into Abra's kitchen without his permission.
[307:19.97]Ronnie, don't make the magician angry.
[307:22.27]You have to get his permission to go into these rooms.
[307:30.29]What is that?
[307:30.81]I don't know what this is.
[307:35.09]Oh, my goodness.
[307:41.47]I can't get poor Abra out of the box.
[307:44.07]I hope he doesn't suffocate in there.
[307:53.33]That's so fucking terrible Strawberry go away.
[308:04.56]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[308:06.80]Don't bother me now.
[308:08.42]Did anyone give you permission to come in?
[308:11.85]Yes, I got the hat to prove it
[308:20.61]What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?
[308:25.34]Honestly, what am I supposed to do about this?
[308:29.44]I need a thing to help him?
[308:31.36]Robert, are you still there?
[308:36.90]I don't know.
[308:42.79]Puzzle on the... Wait, it was on the casket?
[308:52.38]I love the puzzle in the front of the box, but I'm missing a piece.
[308:55.29]Poor old Abba is still trapped in the box.
[309:00.13]I have to get him out of there.
[309:03.39]It's not a casket!
[309:06.98]It's a box!
[309:08.20]Why are we saying casket?
[309:09.88]Who said- I didn't say casket.
[309:13.38]I swear to god I didn't say casket.
[309:14.68]Somebody in chat did.
[309:15.58]That's why I said it.
[309:16.36]Strawberry, I still can't get out of here.
[309:22.99]I can't touch this.
[309:23.47]I can't click these.
[309:24.49]Oh, I got it.
[309:41.72]Strawberry, you amaze me more with every passing second.
[309:46.06]I'm beginning to believe that the little red sweet strawberries have magic talents.
[309:51.08]Still undeveloped, of course, but still worthy of admiration.
[309:54.70]Oh, I'm so hungry.
[309:56.58]I was in the box for such a long time.
[309:59.04]I have the Let's Play open if you get stuck.
[310:00.20]I must have something to eat.
[310:02.64]Oh, how about a magic lollipop?
[310:04.61]We strawberries are red and sweet.
[310:09.39]Uh...
[310:10.66]What would you like to eat, sir?
[310:14.06]I?
[310:14.74]I only eat special dishes.
[310:17.14]Very special.
[310:18.55]Even exceptional.
[310:19.73]Is that salmon or hamburger or what do you eat?
[310:25.75]What do you want?
[310:26.33]Hit my wall.
[310:28.59]It's four different colors and then I will eat the hamburger that pops out of the fridge.
[310:32.50]This is the pantry.
[310:33.42]Go in there.
[310:41.87]Wait.
[310:43.57]He eats strawberries.
[310:45.09]Is it a big plan for me to get eaten?
[310:49.88]What the hell was that?
[311:23.56]strawberry wake up all of the dishes here look very ordinary and the magician wants the most exceptional food here help me
[311:34.26]Okay, so I have to find... This guy wants a weird dish.
[311:36.04]He wants... Okay, so what doesn't belong here?
[311:38.12]You want a cake?
[311:38.58]Um... That's why I picked it.
[311:40.27]Thanks for the input.
[312:05.30]Alright, this is chocolate, loaf of bread, candy, and ice cream.
[312:09.70]It's a loaf of bread.
[312:11.32]Doesn't belong there.
[312:11.88]It's not candy.
[312:13.88]Make me a cake sandwich?
[312:15.43]I don't know.
[312:16.39]What is this?
[312:16.81]Milk?
[312:17.09]A donut.
[312:34.03]That's right.
[312:35.13]Donut is the exception since it is a bakery product and not like yogurt, milk, and cheese, which are milk products.
[312:44.02]Okay, so we have carrot.
[312:47.88]These all look like it's a banana because it's a fruit.
[312:53.18]That's right.
[312:54.52]Banana is the exception because it is a fruit and the tomato, the carrot, and the cucumber are all vegetables.
[313:01.38]This guy's deficient in a lot of stuff.
[313:06.24]OK, so I did it.
[313:08.75]Cake is not the exception since it is a baked product like bread.
[313:12.31]What the fuck are you talking about?
[313:21.78]That's right the banana is the exception since it is a fruit and all the others are bakery products I don't believe this all he wanted to eat was a banana Why didn't he just tell us he wanted a banana?
[313:36.67]Oh?
[313:38.29]I like this guy now I like this guy He's a little strange this magician, but I'm running off to give him his exceptional food I still believe that he can help me even though he couldn't perform any
[313:51.37]Did you know that bananas are radioactive?
[313:56.46]Right?
[314:01.89]All these banana haters.
[314:02.81]I'm hungry.
[314:03.67]Bring me the exceptional dish.
[314:07.22]Here.
[314:18.48]Wonderful.
[314:19.38]This is just what I wanted to eat.
[314:21.54]You know, now that I've calmed down a little, I can tell you, the magic didn't work, perhaps because whenever I do something really big and important, I have to put on my great magician's hat.
[314:33.50]Unfortunately, the hat has disappeared.
[314:36.14]Someone who wanted to be as great as I stole it from me.
[314:39.68]I'm sure that it was one of the pupils in the magician's school.
[314:42.93]Oh, well, never mind.
[314:44.37]The police are taking care of the matter.
[314:46.55]I forgot there were police in this universe.
[314:48.89]Listen, Strawberry.
[314:50.21]Take this note and bring me some vegetables from the magic vegetable garden.
[314:54.50]Why?
[314:54.88]When the gardener sees the note, he'll let you in.
[314:58.22]You know what?
[314:59.16]If you bring me vegetables from the garden and help me find my hat, maybe I'll be able to help you get a little closer to the three items of magic.
[315:07.87]Need vegetables.
[315:08.47]Oh, by the way, why don't you go up the steps and meet my beautiful daughter, Abretta?
[315:14.53]I'll go for a little walk outside.
[315:16.83]I have your hat.
[315:20.92]Oh.
[315:21.68]Okay.
[315:24.30]Okay.
[315:25.27]With permission to enter the garden, I'll go up to the magician's daughter's room.
[315:39.36]Strawberry, who let you in here?
[315:41.72]I've been mad at you for a long time, and if you think you can get away with putting beetles in my bed, I'm warning you, my father will make jam out of you.
[315:52.65]I'm sorry.
[315:54.17]I promise I won't do it again.
[315:56.28]Honest, I really don't want us to be friends again.
[315:59.00]Ronnie, why are you being so nice to that show-off?
[316:09.41]All she does is look at herself in the mirror all day.
[316:11.97]There's no mirror in here.
[316:13.67]How beautiful she is.
[316:16.67]What's wrong with you?
[316:17.39]What's wrong with you?
[316:18.43]What a menace.
[316:46.76]to show you that I want to be your friend.
[316:50.88]Well, let's see.
[316:53.18]I would just love to eat a sugar-coated cherry.
[316:55.62]Got it.
[316:56.02]Bring me one, and then we'll see.
[316:58.40]We were prepared coming into this.
[316:59.80]A sugar-coated yummy.
[317:02.90]That looks really tasty.
[317:04.56]We were ready for that one.
[317:05.68]It just melts in my mouth.
[317:07.86]Strawberry, from now on we're friends.
[317:14.86]Could have been a little longer than half a second.
[317:17.99]You put bugs in her bed, you fucking idiot!
[317:38.94]Don't worry, Strawberry.
[317:40.54]Once I go back to being Ronnie again and I go home, she'll go on thinking that you're me.
[317:45.92]And if you behave yourself, she'll stay your friend.
[317:51.18]Why doesn't she like me?
[317:52.55]I'm putting beetles in her bed.
[317:54.49]Strawberry, honey, now that you and I are friends, I want to give you my picture.
[317:59.01]You can take it with you when you leave.
[318:00.81]But now, let's talk about really important things.
[318:04.33]Let's talk about clothes.
[318:08.03]Alright.
[318:37.71]Alright, here we go.
[318:39.15]It's time to pick the clothing.
[318:42.71]Hurry up and find the right piece of clothing.
[318:49.88]What?
[318:50.96]What's the right piece of clothing?
[318:53.04]Let's say I've been invited to the animal party.
[318:55.72]What should I wear?
[318:56.40]Alright, party.
[318:57.16]I hope you'll find an elegant enough dress for the occasion.
[318:59.58]I'm thinking a dress.
[319:00.14]When you're finished and have found one, let me know.
[319:02.45]Are we thinking a long dress or are we thinking a... What are we thinking here?
[319:05.13]How about this one here?
[319:08.90]What's that one?
[319:12.24]No?
[319:12.36]Um, I don't know.
[319:15.09]Dress?
[319:15.81]Okay.
[319:16.15]What's that?
[319:25.25]Uh, this one?
[319:26.03]Red party gown?
[319:27.63]Okay.
[319:27.97]What else?
[319:29.11]And that's it?
[319:37.95]What's that?
[319:39.47]Party hat.
[319:43.41]No?
[319:43.69]iPhones?
[319:46.41]Diving goggles.
[319:49.15]I don't think that works for a party.
[319:53.06]Flippers.
[319:54.04]Slimsoles.
[320:02.00]Black evening shoes.
[320:08.07]Okay.
[320:09.67]Now what?
[320:14.53]Party?
[320:14.83]This looks like a party hat.
[320:17.03]Um.
[320:24.32]What else do you want?
[320:25.22]What else do you want to wear?
[320:26.02]Decorative?
[320:35.09]Is this weak drip?
[320:35.95]Weak drip.
[320:36.31]Hey!
[321:04.99]You'll see how the mirror starts behaving badly towards me.
[321:10.27]Go away.
[321:11.16]Enough is enough.
[321:13.22]Hardly a minute goes by when she changes what she's wearing and then she comes and looks at me.
[321:18.40]Don't you think this is a little too much?
[321:20.92]You don't?
[321:21.76]Well, this time I won't let you look into me.
[321:24.41]Then we smash the mirror with a hammer.
[321:26.54]Oh, this is great.
[321:28.66]What a fabulous mirror.
[321:30.54]Just my style.
[321:32.02]Why should it work all day?
[321:33.98]I really like this.
[321:38.39]You see?
[321:39.59]Every time I stand in front of this lazy mirror, it makes me mad.
[321:43.70]I so very much want to know what I look like today.
[321:50.16]What?
[321:50.58]What is going on?
[321:52.08]Stop!
[321:52.18]I'm trying to lower the other arm.

[322:50.48]I'm so confused Okay
[323:14.98]But before I leave, there is a question I want to ask you.
[323:19.39]Maybe you know where I can find the magic.
[323:23.91]Of course.
[323:25.03]I can help you a lot.
[323:26.57]But before I do that, you have to bring back the string of pearls that was lost.
[323:32.53]Yes, I have those.
[323:34.55]Here is the string of pearls.
[323:36.87]I worked very hard to get it for you.

[325:13.76]Just a minute.

[325:26.17]Here's my permission to enter the garden.
[325:28.19]Voice crack.
[325:30.11]Please, enter the garden.
[325:35.81]Voice crack.
[325:36.47]Okay.
[326:03.13]A lot of eggplants.
[326:03.99]This one's the biggest one, right?
[326:05.40]There's only one in there.
[326:07.68]I only wanted one vegetable?
[326:08.46]You could've thrown that into his window.
[326:31.47]Like a Nerf football.
[326:33.27]Why did I have to come over here and put it in a basket?
[326:37.54]One.
[326:37.82]Here you go.
[326:38.10]Here's your one eggplant.
[326:47.02]Strawberry, I'm so happy.
[326:49.66]I'm three times happy.
[326:51.67]First, because I found my hat.
[326:53.99]Second, because I can work the vegetable magic without mistakes.
[326:57.83]And third, because you proved to me that you are not a mistake.
[327:02.09]You are great and a magician of wonderful talent.
[327:05.29]Here, take this pink turnip.
[327:07.73]Inside it is one of the magic items you are looking for.
[327:11.12]I'm leaving now.
[327:12.66]Don't forget to come back to me once you have the three items.
[327:16.18]How do I open?
[327:17.24]How do I open up the door?
[327:19.28]I need a disc.
[327:19.98]Thank you very much, Abra.
[327:21.78]But just a minute.
[327:23.40]How do I get the magic item out of the turnip?
[327:29.65]Really?
[327:31.43]Strawberry, come here.
[327:33.63]Abra may think you're a great magician, but I know it's not so easy to get your hands on a magic item if you don't study to become a magician.
[327:41.98]The best thing you could do is go to the forest sorceress.
[327:46.14]She'll help you to get the item out of the turnip.
[327:53.50]Okay.
[327:55.20]Well, I think we're completed up here.
[327:58.10]I need to give that picture to the person at the bridge.
[328:06.04]Why did they make this game?
[328:07.94]Um... Let's be very, very honest.
[328:13.01]Very honest.
[328:16.87]In 1986... This would have been pretty pog.
[328:23.09]I'm sorry.
[328:23.69]This would have been awesome.
[328:27.44]This would have been huge.
[328:28.28]Alright, where's the... The guy at the bridge is over here.
[328:33.97]This would have been amazing.
[328:35.83]If I was 12, 11, 10, and I had this game, I'd be like, holy shit, this is incredible.
[328:42.49]It's huge, yeah.
[328:49.29]picture of a breada the magician's daughter oh strawberry I'm so happy here take this disc I worked hard finally finally that it will open any heart it didn't work for me maybe it will work for you finally short chubby and red hey strawberry come here come back here
[329:20.27]What the fuck was that?
[329:23.83]Weird.
[329:23.97]Alright, I got the disc.
[329:27.47]There's definitely going to be a magic piece down in that dungeon, whatever it is.
[329:34.22]But first of all, I'm going to go get this done.
[329:35.76]I'm going to go turn this in.
[329:38.44]Oh, wow, man.
[329:39.12]This is going to complete the game on stream, you know what I'm saying?
[329:44.89]Let's go get the proof.
[329:52.58]This came out one year before Mario 64.
[329:54.70]93?
[329:54.72]When was Mario 64?
[329:55.34]95?
[329:55.36]96? 96.
[330:23.06]How come you're not in the strawberry magic category?
[330:26.45]It's just, I don't know.
[330:27.41]There's, like, so many people playing this.
[330:30.01]There's, like, tons of people playing it, so.
[330:32.65]I did a couple other things, too.
[330:33.76]It's, like, just, like, a really saturated category.
[330:37.84]What does it have right now?
[330:38.60]Let me see.
[330:41.95]650k 50,000 watching yeah, I mean I was doing other retro games, so I I don't want to like it I need your help very much.
[330:51.51]I've brought the magic pink turnip with me and I need to release the magic item inside it Show me the magic pink turnip and I'll be glad to help you There you go give me a magical crystal I
[331:10.08]That was weird.
[331:10.46]Oh, come on.
[331:10.78]What do I need to do?
[331:12.50]No.
[331:26.99]Strawberry, even the most talented magicians in the world sometimes need help from less talented magicians.
[331:34.79]But on a different subject, I'll let you in on a big secret.
[331:39.73]Abra does not know the magic of the pink turnip.
[331:43.17]and my specialty is in the magic of release so it's a good thing you've come to me all the items in this room can put together the magic to release an item however in order to know what items are needed for the pink turnip I have to close my eyes and dream the items will soon appear in my dream
[332:07.03]You can help me by looking into my dream and try to remember the items that appeared in it.
[332:14.33]Then, bring them to me from the cubbyholes on the wall.
[332:20.11]This must be the dream!
[332:21.25]I've been sitting on my balls for a long time, and I just realized it.
[332:24.15]You ever get that?
[332:25.45]You ever figure that out?
[332:28.10]Like, I've been sitting on my balls, and I just figured it out right now.
[332:30.84]What was it?
[332:38.81]I wasn't paying any attention.
[332:45.28]I didn't pay a single piece of attention.
[332:46.84]I didn't pay attention at all.
[332:48.38]Dude, what?
[332:50.52]What?
[332:54.30]A trumpet!
[332:58.05]Dude, what?
[333:04.13]It was rope?
[333:07.76]Is that rope?
[333:14.98]A dragon's tail!
[333:16.36]It's a dragon's tail!
[333:19.27]What else?
[333:23.87]Was the wheel there?
[333:28.67]The hat was there too?
[333:31.75]I just didn't even look.
[333:33.20]A magician's hat!
[333:37.10]And the wheel.
[333:40.55]Is that it?
[333:43.17]One more?
[333:48.45]Window?
[333:50.09]What else was there?
[333:54.90]That's it?
[333:55.32]So what the hell?
[333:56.54]Now that we have created the magic, we have to make it work on the turnip.
[334:07.24]Here, Strawberry.
[334:08.68]The trick has succeeded.
[334:09.86]The magic item is coming out.
[334:16.35]Thank you very much.
[334:17.55]It looked kind of rotten in the middle.
[334:18.87]Aren't you supposed to be an Elden Ring streamer?
[334:22.50]Sometimes we break it up with a little bit of variety.
[334:44.24]He's so scary.
[334:46.38]Why?
[334:47.46]What did I do?
[334:48.26]What do you mean he's so scary?
[334:54.06]I didn't do anything since you got here.
[334:56.60]I was just sitting here playing the strawberry game and I was like, oh, my balls hurt.
[335:00.48]That's it.
[335:01.96]That's the only thing that happened.
[335:05.00]It's a little weird.
[335:07.19]It's a little odd that I said that.
[335:08.83]But, I mean, it's like 10.30 at night.
[335:10.79]But,
[335:21.83]This guy craves brisket.
[335:23.40]I wish.
[335:24.24]I wish.
[335:33.98]God, imagine, like... Stop telling... It's gross.
[335:40.21]Alright, fine.
[335:45.33]I'm just... Just in case you see me go, like... People are gonna be like, what's wrong?
[335:49.38]What happened?
[335:49.72]What's wrong with him?
[335:52.07]No one would be like, oh, I hit my finger on the... My finger hurts.
[335:55.22]That would make me a liar.
[335:56.60]Where is this fucking place?
[336:09.92]Across the bridge.
[336:10.56]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[336:12.57]Where are you going?
[336:13.67]Shoot, I'm trying.
[336:19.13]We will know if you lie.
[336:29.79]How many royalties do I get from the Joker?
[336:31.61]I mean, that'd be pretty fucking awesome.
[336:35.81]For real.
[336:42.10]Hey, it's a mature audience stream.
[336:43.64]You had to click the thing.
[336:47.44]We might be playing a game for seven-year-olds, but it's, uh, it's a mature stream.
[336:54.11]Alright, put the disc in.
[336:56.97]Let's go.
[336:59.56]work is magic and magic's work too this is well known to me and to you the door has opened I'll just finish eating and we'll fly over the deep dark pit is this a cbd stream no I don't I don't look I have
[337:32.68]I stopped taking TBD Teach to you on stream.
[337:35.40]In like a year and a half.
[337:38.33]Now, I've said that like a bunch of times, so it's a lie, but it's not.
[337:41.99]Okay.
[337:44.47]Nice.
[337:44.79]This is it.
[337:45.63]This is it.
[337:46.79]This is the end here.
[338:00.93]This is the end.
[338:01.47]What do you think I got in my pocket right here?
[338:04.75]Dice.
[338:04.97]Bingo.
[338:06.01]Are you guys ready?
[338:07.15]We're going to see the end of the game.
[338:09.13]How many days have gone by since I've been here?
[338:33.16]My parents have to be looking for me.
[338:34.76]The fairy doesn't like the light and doesn't like visitors.
[338:38.62]That's why she hides.
[338:40.56]But when a visitor does come, she comes out disguised as a firefly.
[338:45.03]And she always has some real fireflies around her to light up the cave.
[338:49.97]The secret is that the fairy's light is not steady.
[338:53.66]And as soon as she comes out, it blinks for a few seconds.
[338:59.82]Pay careful attention, Ronnie.
[339:01.66]When the group of fireflies come out, you have to direct your attention to the one whose light blinks.
[339:07.80]You must then follow her and catch her.
[339:10.56]If you succeed, the fairy will appear in her real form.
[339:14.16]Play Radigan's theme.
[339:26.86]That one's blinking.
[339:34.86]Wow!
[339:36.38]Here she is!
[339:38.08]Appearing before my very eyes!
[339:40.41]How beautiful and regal she is!
[339:43.85]Hello, brave Rani.
[339:51.19]I'm so pleased that you tried so hard to meet me.
[339:54.61]You are a very special boy, and you have a brilliant future ahead of you.
[339:58.65]Uh, hello to you too, Firefly Fairy!
[340:04.11]You... you know that... that I'm Ronnie?
[340:09.19]Of course.
[340:10.50]I've been waiting for your visit for quite some time.
[340:13.74]As a matter of fact, ever since you arrived in Magic Land.
[340:18.12]I wanted to make sure that even when you saw some glittering magic, you would know how to tell which is the real magic.
[340:25.56]You have done that, and you have earned this magic item.
[340:29.42]Here, it is yours.
[340:32.83]What am I gonna be- Weren't we doing like a little thing at school?
[340:35.57]I have three magic items!
[340:37.41]I have to go to Abra quickly!
[340:41.54]But... Who cares?
[340:43.72]Like wha- You couldn't have just... Go learn to coin trick on YouTube?
[340:50.92]Oh, you're the dancer!
[340:52.34]You're the chef!
[340:54.91]You're the magician, haha!
[340:57.07]Why did I have- I could've just learned a card trick or something.
[341:02.53]Let's go.
[341:02.85]Let's go, Flybird.
[341:04.07]We're taking off.
[341:06.97]Zip.
[341:08.49]I have all the great runes.
[341:14.57]Oh, yeah.
[341:14.89]We're coming.
[341:16.41]I'm not going to say it.
[341:17.19]Never mind.
[341:20.48]Whatever.
[341:29.40]Thank you very much, Flybird.
[341:31.46]It was
[341:32.95]You guys can say it.
[341:34.97]Everyone hates when I say it.
[341:35.81]We hope you have enjoyed your flight.
[341:37.98]If you have, please tell all your friends and relatives about our wonderful service, always available to you.
[341:44.74]Thank you for flying birdish airways.
[341:51.04]This is where we wake up and we come out.
[341:54.37]Whatever.
[341:55.57]I'm not going to say it.
[341:56.73]Everyone hates it.
[341:57.67]I'm not going to say it.
[341:58.29]Everybody hates it.
[341:59.05]Everybody hates it.
[342:01.35]No, we're going to Abracadabra's house, and we're ending the game.
[342:10.15]Nobody knows what you're saying?
[342:11.07]Yeah, they do.
[342:16.25]I said, we're gonna... At the end of the game, it's like, oh, you were like in this weird limbo area, and you're gonna come out of the birth canal.
[342:24.65]That's what every game, right?
[342:25.87]That's what every game is.
[342:28.31]Yes, the birth canal.
[342:37.03]Every game with a complicated ending is always like, oh, you're gonna wake up, you're gonna open your eyes, you're gonna be coming out of the birth canal.
[342:42.06]I- Why is he so weird?
[343:01.53]It's not- I'm just- I-
[343:05.34]An Elden Ring!
[343:06.56]Oh, at the end of the game, yeah, you're gonna wake up, it's gonna be, you're gonna be, you're gonna get out of, like, limbo, and you're gonna, like, be reborn, right?
[343:12.56]That's the, that's the joke.
[343:18.37]I'm not speaking to that joke anymore.
[343:21.83]He's high, he's high as fuck.
[343:23.53]I'm not.
[343:24.27]Everyone needs to relax, right now.
[343:25.85]Or I'll end the stream.
[343:32.78]Where am I going?
[343:38.52]Dude, have I done that, like, three times tonight?
[343:40.04]I feel like I have.
[343:49.25]One of these days, I'm gonna play a game.
[343:51.69]I'm telling you, it's gonna be an elaborate, big, elaborate ending.
[343:55.29]And it's gonna be with being, like, reborn or something.
[344:03.77]Ronnie, you have succeeded.
[344:05.88]You have found the three magic items.
[344:10.06]You've never done the birth canal?
[344:12.02]Yes, I have.
[344:12.78]Oh my god, you're out of your mind.
[344:14.42]I do it every other game.
[344:17.09]Now that you have proven that your will to find the magic was strong enough to let you succeed in the difficult tasks you were given, I can reveal to you the real secret of magic.
[344:29.76]But I've already found it!
[344:31.92]I have the magic!
[344:35.24]Listen to me, Ronnie, and I can tell you that I know you are Ronnie.
[344:39.46]Yes, you did find magic, but that is just a magic trick.
[344:43.94]It is an illusion when the audience thinks that you have performed magic when really you have only been quick with your hands.
[344:52.27]this is what rabbit owner the magician did but what he does is not real magic the secret of real magic is in this book and I will reveal it to you strawberry you had better listen too although I think that you already understand most of the secret
[345:10.30]As you have already seen, work and commitment are the magic.
[345:14.62]When we want something very, very much, we sometimes think that what we want is magic.
[345:20.18]But if we work hard and keep at it, we will always reach the magic.
[345:26.10]Magic Land is the proof of this.
[345:28.68]You saw for yourselves.
[345:30.41]You have seen that you cannot be a good magician without studying in school.
[345:35.47]To gain the knowledge that will allow you to invent things,
[345:40.59]Magic is just reading books?
[345:42.20]Vegetables are magic?
[345:43.40]I agree.
[345:43.76]I actually agree with that.
[345:45.80]It's weird.
[346:01.50]You put this little tiny little seed in the ground and it fucking expands in the ground into an edible thing.
[346:05.84]...that you cannot use knowledge that someone else gave you.
[346:09.59]It's a fact.
[346:10.71]Only she could get the magic out of the turnip you brought her.
[346:14.89]You most certainly learned that you cannot steal knowledge and use it like the student in the magician's school tried to do.
[346:26.10]We have seen that every goal we hope to reach is magic that requires hard work.
[346:32.16]You even have to work hard to gain love.
[346:35.10]That's right, isn't it Strawberry?
[346:37.79]You have to work hard to win my daughter's love.
[346:40.91]I am happy that Magic Land was able to teach you what we already know.
[346:46.00]Just a made-up word understand how to get magic and use it correctly Even if you are faced with several kinds of magic that your will wants to achieve This every noun And you don't have to be afraid even if you think that a deep dark pit separates you from your magic I
[347:08.80]When you went to the carpenter and he performed magic with the hammer hitting the nail.
[347:12.51]When you went to the chef and he performed his magic making the food.
[347:15.31]That's not how it works.
[347:16.19]Like exactly what you're doing the easy path of explaining to a child.
[347:17.93]Who is me.
[347:18.67]That everything is magic.
[347:40.75]Also, the illusion magic that you can perform at the party.
[347:44.73]All magic.
[347:45.35]I wish you luck.
[347:46.47]And more than that, I wish you luck in finding the real magic for you.
[347:53.07]And you, Strawberry, come back home.
[347:56.35]Even if it is hard for you, we understand.
[347:59.11]Make no mistake, we love you and will help you.
[348:06.00]Wait, he knows?
[348:26.84]Ronnie, I can't believe it.
[348:29.14]They always knew that you were not me, and yet they helped us.
[348:33.34]Ronnie, I'm going back.
[348:35.02]I'm going back full of energy.
[348:37.28]My task is to find my magic and become the best magician in the world.
[348:44.63]And I'm sure you'll succeed.
[348:47.01]Thank you for all your help.
[348:50.27]Oh, unfortunately for you, Ronnie.
[348:54.43]That was a real spell.
[348:56.08]You're not going anywhere.
[348:57.46]You are permanently a tomato.
[348:59.32]You're not going anywhere.
[349:08.95]Oh, here we go.
[349:09.35]It's the talent show.
[349:17.65]This is it!
[349:18.51]What?
[349:19.41]What the fuck?
[349:19.91]Wait, there are like living carrots in the real world?
[349:22.75]Isn't that kind of weird?
[349:42.30]no one's asking a question of like where did all these like weird like mutated fruits and vegetables come from this is his heart the whole time oh he took too much
[350:19.99]The crowd was amazed and were all wondering where did Ronnie learn such wonderful magic.
[350:25.42]But only Ronnie and Strawberry knew the real magic they learned was not the one shown on stage.
[350:35.28]Wait, what does that say?
[350:36.74]I'm not back at the school.
[350:46.87]I'm not at the school.
[350:47.79]I didn't go back home.
[350:50.40]I'm in magic world still.
[350:52.12]I never went back home.
[351:09.47]That's Swedish.
[351:11.66]I liked that a lot.
[351:13.08]That was cute.
[351:19.79]The real magic was- magic was just replaced as a verb or what a noun for hard work.
[351:29.33]But then I actually like floated a thing and they made a magical explosion and it floated up.
[351:33.91]I got turned into a strawberry.
[351:38.01]Magic was real.
[351:39.01]How would I become a strawberry?
[351:44.58]I'm telling you, we just need to wait a few more minutes here.
[351:47.82]And then the birth canal ending happens.
[351:52.15]Keep running, come on.
[352:04.97]Okay.
[352:08.17]Press enter?
[352:08.73]I don't think that did anything.
[352:14.97]Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[352:16.21]Now that's it, I got to the end of the disc.
[352:25.07]There's a sequel?
[352:26.55]Is there actually a sequel?
[352:30.73]No, there's not.
[352:31.45]Really?
[352:33.35]Strawberry Magic.
[352:38.48]There is a sequel.
[352:41.04]Oh, I'm definitely going to play that at some point.
[352:45.56]I think that's probably a good time to end it.
[352:46.96]There's an episode two of Strawberry Magic.
[352:49.89]I'm definitely going to play the sequel.
[352:56.00]It was 11 o'clock.
[352:56.66]I think this is a good place to probably stop for now.
[353:05.53]I actually liked that a lot.
[353:08.61]That was really fun.
[353:09.33]Some of these old games are just so weird.
[353:12.05]They just need to be experienced.
[353:14.75]When are we going to come out of the...
[353:22.50]What about... Yeah, Tonka Construction, I did not realize.
[353:25.50]It's not a DOS game.
[353:27.04]It's a Windows 3.1 game.
[353:28.58]I need a virtual machine to play it.
[353:30.74]So, I'm going to need to get that set up.
[353:34.65]I think I could probably install Windows 3.1 on DOSBox and get that to work.
[353:39.53]But, that's not technically a DOS game.
[353:45.57]Yeah, that's it.
[353:46.67]We can end here.
[353:51.11]So, the next stream...
[353:54.09]We were live yesterday, today, well, nothing tomorrow.
[353:58.23]I'll be back on Tuesday.
[354:02.00]Seems like a good time to go.
[354:03.80]Tuesday the 19th.
[354:05.80]There's a lot of stuff that I can do.
[354:09.58]There's more DOS.
[354:10.82]I got like another probably 15 to 20 games and more.
[354:15.21]There's also the casino, Sim Casino.
[354:22.19]What is it called?
[354:22.81]Sim Casino?
[354:29.41]Not Casino Inc.
[354:30.19]It's a different one.
[354:30.63]It's a new one.
[354:35.03]Let me see.
[354:35.33]I got a list here.
[354:35.89]Let me see.
[354:36.27]Let me take a look at it.
[354:44.44]Anything's doing it for you?
[354:45.30]What do you guys think?
[354:50.52]We've got Blood, Fresh Supply.
[354:53.22]That's a DOS game, but it's a shooter, so it could be pretty cool.
[354:59.09]There's also... There's this car, that car game, that Mon, uh, Bazao?
[355:06.53]Mon Bazao?
[355:11.20]Sim Casino.
[355:13.08]A lot of people want me to play Wobble Dogs.
[355:17.94]I keep seeing that pop up in Recommended.
[355:19.70]Is it any good?
[355:28.20]I'm seeing a lot of yeses.
[355:29.27]Okay.
[355:31.89]Yeah, maybe we'll check out a couple.
[355:33.61]Not tomorrow, on Tuesday.
[355:34.47]A lot of people saying blood.
[355:38.18]Alright, we've got like three options.
[355:40.37]On Tuesday, we'll pick one.
[355:46.84]And at some point, I really do want to... I'll talk to Ludwig.
[355:50.42]I want to see if we can set up that Elden Ring PvP night.
[355:54.31]Like the kind of community trial by combat with, you know, each streamer picks like three or four champions.
[356:00.65]That might take a little longer to set up.
[356:04.19]But at the very least, Tuesday we'll do one of those three games I just said.
[356:08.39]Any updates on the baseball stream?
[356:09.77]It is going to be in July.
[356:11.01]The date is locked down.
[356:13.12]It is confirmed.
[356:14.62]I have a hard date.
[356:16.24]But I want to make sure.
[356:17.62]I'll announce the hard date on Tuesday.
[356:21.08]I do have a hard date for the baseball stream.
[356:27.70]I want to be completely accurate with it though.
[356:29.58]I don't want to give you false information.
[356:32.39]But it will be in July.
[356:33.73]Guaranteed.
[356:34.25]Confirmed.
[356:35.71]It is already booked.
[356:43.38]Oh, it isn't locked down.
[356:44.36]Well, no, the date is locked down.
[356:46.00]It's a hard lockdown date.
[356:47.36]I just need to talk to Community Jake.
[356:49.94]Because there's a few things that I want to make sure exist before I announce it.
[356:58.26]What is the baseball stream?
[356:59.24]You'll see.
[357:00.78]You'll see.
[357:01.14]It's a big event stream.
[357:01.98]You'll see.
[357:08.97]Yeah, have an awesome night.
[357:09.95]Thanks for watching.
[357:12.13]I know that I've been starting later and going later recently, but I've been more active at night recently.
[357:20.75]Uh, yeah.
[357:21.81]I'll see you guys Tuesday.
[357:26.43]Have a good rest of your weekend here.
[357:28.21]There's another day.
[357:28.71]Have a good Sunday, of course.
[357:29.89]Take care of yourselves.
[357:33.23]I'll see you Tuesday.
[357:40.06]Good night, guys.
[357:40.40]See you later.
[357:44.81]you
[358:19.68]you
