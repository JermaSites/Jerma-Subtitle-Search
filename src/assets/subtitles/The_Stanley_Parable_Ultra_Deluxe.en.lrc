[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.89]Nope.
[00:09.29]I'm here.
[00:10.61]Nope.
[00:14.45]Told you.
[00:16.79]What's going on?
[00:17.17]How you doing?
[00:18.46]Hey, what's up?
[00:21.30]On time, yeah.
[00:22.70]But once.
[00:26.66]The one and only time I will ever be on time.
[00:36.36]No, that's not true.
[00:39.05]So we had a plan today, but the plan kind of got changed a little.
[00:42.91]Just a little.
[00:47.35]I was going to do Stanley Parable, and then infomercials, or infomercials, and then Stanley Parable.
[00:53.27]But it has been brought to my attention that The Stanley Parable deluxe mode is way longer than an hour or two.
[01:03.36]I played the old one from ten years ago.
[01:06.63]And I remember after like an hour or two, I was like, oh, okay.
[01:09.53]So this is way more than just like a graphical update.
[01:13.93]This is apparently a, there's a ton of new stuff.
[01:19.29]So it's about, it could be about four to six hours.
[01:23.02]Yeah.
[01:23.42]So this is probably going to take the whole stream.
[01:27.90]But that's cool.
[01:29.64]That's alright.
[01:32.06]I played for about seven hours, seven and a half.
[01:39.88]So, infomercials are gonna be tomorrow.
[01:42.92]We'll go tomorrow.
[01:45.00]We'll do infomercials for like, well, maybe three or four hours tomorrow.
[01:49.80]So, I'm gonna split it up.
[01:51.64]So, instead of one eight-hour stream where I play Stanley Parable for three hours and then infomercials for three hours, I'm gonna break it up.
[02:00.33]I'll do Stanley Parable as long as I feel like playing today.
[02:04.15]Try to see everything I want to see, maybe.
[02:06.49]And then, just infomercials tomorrow.
[02:14.91]What about inscription?
[02:17.97]I am, uh, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be playing inscription on my off time.
[02:24.59]I feel like I would enjoy it more.
[02:32.65]That means he's never playing it again.
[02:34.70]No, that means I'm never streaming it again.
[02:36.72]Oh, oh, no, he said it.
[02:39.40]Oh, oh, I said it.
[02:50.62]Can we get a hernia update?
[02:53.46]I don't think I really... Oh, health update.
[02:56.40]Sorry.
[02:56.70]Hey, can we get an update on the hernia, dude?
[03:01.78]Maybe.
[03:04.52]I'm doing alright.
[03:07.36]Still having issues.
[03:08.94]It hasn't never gone away.
[03:10.82]Didn't get better, didn't get worse.
[03:12.31]It's just still there.
[03:14.60]I just don't talk about it.
[03:17.48]Why talk about it all the time and have every other stream have, like, a down point?
[03:23.07]Right?
[03:23.41]No.
[03:24.49]I'm doing alright.
[03:25.27]I'll be okay.
[03:25.81]Don't worry about me.
[03:28.31]There are a few options that I have to consider over the next 6-12 months.
[03:34.10]I might do a few procedures.
[03:35.64]I have, actually, I have an appointment coming up to talk about these very things.
[03:42.30]Am I going to just go get hernia surgery?
[03:44.75]Am I going to do an intercostal nerve block?
[03:48.81]These are the things that I could do.
[03:49.93]These are the things that are options to see if I can kind of get rid of it.
[03:54.71]I don't know.
[03:58.01]I would be lying to you if I didn't say that the three or four months I took off from streaming and I didn't solve the problem was a little demoralizing, if I'm honest.
[04:11.85]Because, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm just going to go to the doctor like fucking 20 times and figure this out.
[04:18.10]Didn't happen.
[04:20.86]I might have kind of figured it out.
[04:22.88]We'll find out.
[04:24.25]But it's going to take some major, I want to say, lifestyle changes and potential procedures, like maybe a surgical procedure to see if it works.
[04:36.69]What?
[04:37.01]There's your update.
[04:37.69]I'm fine.
[04:38.67]I'm drinking green tea.
[04:40.07]I got green tea coursing through my veins.
[04:41.95]Am I loud?
[04:42.67]I turned myself up.
[04:50.18]Am I loud now?
[04:50.82]Am I good?
[04:57.01]Black tea is better.
[05:05.31]Dude, I can't stop laughing.
[05:08.12]What the fuck?
[05:13.84]Oh, fuck, dude.
[05:14.69]I was laughing so hard at what you just said.
[05:16.91]I can't believe you just said that.
[05:18.63]It was so funny what you said.
[05:19.59]No, they're both good.
[05:26.98]I'm not a tea elitist.
[05:28.14]I'm not a coffee elitist.
[05:29.26]I drink Folgers and I drink the expensive stuff.
[05:34.10]I drink green tea and I drink like Lipton black tea out of the little bag thing.
[05:40.11]You know what I mean?
[05:41.07]I like it.
[05:42.03]I enjoy all these things.
[05:51.76]You're a tea centrist.
[05:53.12]Call me whatever you want.
[05:54.77]Call me whatever you want.
[05:55.73]I know what I am up here.
[05:58.17]And that is an enjoyer of all things.
[06:00.40]Okay?
[06:02.62]You can call me whatever you want.
[06:04.58]That's your opinion.
[06:05.40]But your opinion is not my opinion.
[06:07.26]And my opinion is my own fact.
[06:11.92]Get dunked on.
[06:12.42]Are you guys ready to play?
[06:14.68]Before I embarrass myself in the pre-stream anymore.
[06:16.86]Here we go.
[06:25.30]Okay.
[06:27.36]Stanley Parable.
[06:29.08]Deluxe Edition.
[06:30.60]Ultra Deluxe, I think is what it's actually called.
[06:35.61]Could I call you my husband?
[06:37.05]No, that would be fucking weird.
[06:38.29]Uh, no, that'd be odd.
[06:44.66]Okay.
[06:45.92]Why do I... Do you guys ever go... Okay.
[06:47.92]Okay.
[06:49.94]Does anybody just sit at their setup and it's been the same exact thing for potentially years, but something just fucking doesn't, something just doesn't feel right.
[07:00.07]I feel like I'm just, I'm like, I'm uncomfortable.
[07:01.87]Why?
[07:02.11]I'm like, like the seats, I'm like, no, I hate it.
[07:07.61]Like what's going on here?
[07:08.57]Why do I feel like this?
[07:12.59]Like, my seat's too low.
[07:14.31]My seat's too high.
[07:15.23]There's not enough cushion.
[07:16.03]There's too much cushion.
[07:17.26]The armrests are in the wrong place.
[07:18.96]I can't, like, grab the mouse.
[07:20.02]I can't move.
[07:21.36]This sucks.
[07:22.04]I don't know.
[07:22.42]Nothing happened.
[07:24.06]Nothing changed.
[07:24.96]This has been the same.
[07:25.58]Look, I feel like I'm floating around.
[07:27.19]What's happening?
[07:29.03]Stop gaslighting yourself and just play the game.
[07:34.89]This is going to be... You've changed.
[07:45.49]I'm kidding!
[07:46.05]That was a fucking joke finger.
[07:47.77]What's wrong with this?
[07:53.23]Hold on.
[07:56.87]Okay, my feet are not touching the ground.
[07:59.83]You understand what I'm saying?
[08:03.30]My feet are not touching the ground right now.
[08:06.98]But they did yesterday.
[08:13.88]But that doesn't feel right either.
[08:15.28]Now my knees are like up.
[08:16.56]I'm like too far down.
[08:17.67]I don't know what I did.
[08:22.01]This doesn't feel right.
[08:23.85]Shit doesn't feel right.
[08:26.03]That feels a little better.
[08:26.71]That's a little bit better.
[08:31.50]I might move a couple things.
[08:33.08]Not yet though.
[08:33.58]Alright, I think I'm alright.
[08:34.56]I think we can go.
[08:38.56]I know everyone's gonna backseat me in this game, and people are gonna tell me, like, go in that door, go in that door.
[08:44.16]You're just gonna get fucking banned, like, for a year.
[08:46.73]If you say even one, if you say the word, like, go, and then, like, blah blah blah blah blah, door, you're gonna get timed out for, like, fucking two years.
[08:55.77]Just wanna make sure you know that.
[08:58.09]If people get too crazy about it, we're gonna put it in emote-only mode, and, like, you're gonna get banned for a year.
[09:06.97]There you go.
[09:07.34]I scared them.
[09:07.88]Now they won't do it.
[09:09.45]This is the story of a man named Stanley.
[09:12.56]Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.
[09:20.16]Employee number 427's job was simple.
[09:24.12]He sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.
[09:29.56]Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.
[09:37.75]This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year.
[09:44.45]And although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.
[09:55.21]And Stanley was happy.
[09:59.30]Stanley decided to get up and go this way.
[10:00.93]And then one day something very peculiar happened.
[10:03.81]Something that would forever change Stanley.
[10:06.89]Something he would never quite forget.
[10:09.78]He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.
[10:18.40]No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say hi.
[10:24.48]Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.
[10:30.68]Something was very clearly wrong.
[10:33.04]Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.
[10:39.62]But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.
[10:55.99]F1.
[10:56.15]Okay, maybe I should press F1.
[11:05.56]Alright, the FOV's at 90, but it kind of feels like it's too high for me.
[11:08.12]Is that weird to say?
[11:16.01]It is too high.
[11:16.95]Yeah, it's like too high.
[11:17.83]Hold on.
[11:21.27]I'm sure it's like 85 maybe?
[11:23.00]That feels a little better.
[11:26.56]Yeah, it was a little too much.
[11:30.35]You should leave the room.
[11:31.91]I'm going to do whatever I want to do in The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe mode, okay?
[11:41.11]But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.
[11:44.27]What if he had to make a decision?
[11:46.03]What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?
[11:49.25]He had never been trained for that.
[11:51.09]No.
[11:52.09]This couldn't go any way except badly.
[11:54.83]The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait.
[11:58.23]Nothing will hurt me.
[11:59.73]Nothing will break me.
[12:00.79]In here, I can be happy forever.
[12:04.65]I will be happy.
[12:05.47]In 15 minutes, am I going to get...
[12:10.39]Had years gone by, he no longer had the ability to tell.
[12:14.40]But the one thing he knew for sure, beyond any doubt, was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.
[12:20.80]Eventually, someday, they would arrive.
[12:23.98]Soon, very soon now, this will end.
[12:27.18]He will be spoken to.
[12:28.61]He will be told what to do.
[12:31.71]Now it's just a little bit closer.
[12:35.25]Now it's even closer.
[12:37.51]Here it comes.
[12:41.96]What?
[12:50.19]But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.
[12:52.79]I'm not going anywhere.
[12:53.73]He had to make a decision.
[12:55.11]What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?
[12:58.36]He had been trained for that.
[12:59.72]Okay.
[13:01.18]This couldn't go any way except badly.
[13:03.30]The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait.
[13:06.60]I don't know.
[13:06.90]I figured maybe if he did it twice, he'd get annoyed or something.
[13:09.89]In here, I can be happy forever.
[13:13.73]I will be happy.
[13:15.35]Stanley waited.
[13:16.79]Hours passed.
[13:18.09]Then days.
[13:19.47]Had years gone by?
[13:21.09]He no longer had the ability to tell.
[13:23.47]But the one thing he knew for sure, beyond any doubt, was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.
[13:29.86]Eventually, someday, they would arrive.
[13:31.92]I can't leave?
[13:32.28]I don't know, I thought it was gonna be... Soon, very soon now, this will end.
[13:36.24]He will be spoken to.
[13:37.60]He will be told what to do.
[13:38.66]He will be told what to do.
[13:40.78]Now it's just a little bit closer.
[13:44.19]After a hundred cycles.
[13:45.61]Don't say that.
[13:46.61]Here it comes.
[13:47.45]Okay.
[13:48.47]Okay.
[13:49.83]So, if I close the door, I get a funny ending.
[14:04.62]Can't open 428.
[14:05.52]I can't open 429.
[14:07.93]All of his co-workers were gone.
[14:09.95]What could it mean?
[14:11.45]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[14:13.45]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[14:16.02]Okay, everybody's gone.
[14:17.06]No matter how hard Stanley looked, Stanley went around touching every little thing in the office.
[14:22.35]But it didn't make a single difference.
[14:24.43]Nor did it advance the story in any way.
[14:27.19]Yeah, but you never know.
[14:30.29]That's why, can I just say, I do appreciate when devs have like a point and click adventure game.
[14:35.45]And, like, stuff kind of glows.
[14:39.18]Right?
[14:39.64]Like, ooh, there's like a thing you can touch over here.
[14:41.52]It glows.
[14:42.48]Rather than have nothing there.
[14:44.38]And you just have to...
[14:48.50]And then this draw on the bottom opens.
[14:50.98]Like, I don't know.
[14:54.75]Like, I like when things glow.
[14:56.09]So, like, don't tell me what to do with it, but just tell me that I can interact with it.
[14:59.13]Like, oh, look, it's interactable.
[15:00.25]Rather than just walk around and do that.
[15:04.03]Okay.
[15:04.67]But no, this is cool.
[15:05.47]So, alright, everyone's gone.
[15:06.67]I can't go in 437.
[15:08.13]I can't go in 430.
[15:08.75]This doesn't matter.
[15:11.13]Just go.
[15:11.81]Close all doors behind you so the amnesia monster does not get us.
[15:25.49]Okay, I'm stuck in here.
[15:30.65]425, 425.
[15:30.71]This office is fucked up.
[15:33.25]What is going on here?
[15:33.89]What does that say?
[15:38.10]What'd that say?
[15:38.56]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[15:41.44]Awaiting input.
[15:43.06]Input received.
[15:47.80]More?
[15:48.02]Do I have to touch all the computers?
[15:55.88]Should I do it again?
[15:57.80]Input received.
[15:58.56]Alright, I got it.
[15:59.06]Does that do anything for me?
[16:03.96]Okay.
[16:09.07]Ah, spill.
[16:11.11]I hate Mondays.
[16:12.05]17, nope.
[16:23.19]You gotta break it up a little bit, man.
[16:24.83]Like, if I ever had an office complex, you gotta break it up a little bit.
[16:28.80]When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[16:35.54]No, he didn't.
[16:36.20]He entered the door on his right.
[16:38.32]I, yeah.
[16:39.43]Where am I gonna go?
[16:40.15]Am I gonna defy the narrator?
[16:42.57]No.
[16:53.53]I'm going left.
[16:53.87]This looks like the whiteboard that we had for the dollhouse meetings.
[17:03.17]Like, this is kind of what we were doing.
[17:04.55]Yeah.
[17:22.94]Alright, cool.
[17:23.43]Business meeting.
[17:30.65]Everyone is unique.
[17:31.29]You, most of all.
[17:32.68]Me?
[17:35.42]Synergize core value expenditures.
[17:37.98]Shift global market.
[17:40.43]I've read.
[17:41.29]Monetize free-to-play.
[17:46.09]What do people want?
[17:47.23]Things.
[17:47.65]Money.
[17:47.97]More money.
[17:48.49]Things, but with money to buy more things.
[17:50.27]Graphs.
[17:50.75]Graphs about things and money.
[17:53.14]Stock market is somewhere here.
[17:55.04]Colored in segments.
[17:55.82]Stripes.
[17:56.26]Requires more secondary research.
[17:57.78]What is hot?
[17:58.34]Profits.
[17:59.08]I don't know.
[18:03.74]You know, sometimes I feel like these big executive board meetings are just kind of nap time when you were fucking five years old.
[18:13.99]They all come in there and they shake hands.
[18:16.19]They're like, oh, yes, how you doing?
[18:17.31]Yeah.
[18:18.49]Michael, Michael, good to see you again.
[18:20.31]Yeah, profits are up.
[18:21.21]They are, they sure are.
[18:22.29]And they're like, it's like sleeping bags all over the ground.
[18:25.07]And they like are getting in.
[18:27.17]Yeah, yeah.
[18:27.79]Oh, yeah.
[18:28.81]Yeah, we could fire like four or five hundred more people.
[18:30.99]Yeah, I think that would be a decent idea.
[18:32.65]Yeah.
[18:33.77]Okay.
[18:34.57]You good?
[18:34.89]Yeah.
[18:36.07]Say hello to the wife and kids for me.
[18:38.97]And they're all just fucking sleeping in sleeping bags here for like two hours.
[18:43.54]And then they get up and they leave.
[18:45.99]And they shake hands and they say thanks.
[18:51.13]What happens in these board meetings?
[18:53.17]Like, what even happens in them?
[18:55.49]No, I wasn't done.
[18:56.15]I wasn't done with my board meeting rant.
[18:58.13]Come on, man.
[19:02.27]Stanley stepped into the broom closet, but there was nothing here.
[19:05.62]So he turned around and got back on track.
[19:09.30]Somebody just comes in with like eight glasses of milk.
[19:13.27]I like carrots and broccoli.
[19:15.51]Raw carrots and raw broccoli.
[19:25.94]Am I stuck in here?
[19:27.28]No, that's bullshit.
[19:28.48]No, that's bullshit.
[19:29.54]There's something in here.
[19:40.90]F.A.
[19:41.02]Forensics analysis?
[20:02.03]Are you, are you really still in the broom closet?
[20:04.41]Yes.
[20:04.93]Standing around doing nothing?
[20:06.83]Why?
[20:07.91]Please offer me some explanation here.
[20:09.62]I'm, I'm genuinely confused.
[20:11.26]I got a very important board meeting going on.
[20:13.04]Don't you understand?
[20:14.40]We're talking about, uh, we're talking about what we're going to do in the third quarter.
[20:18.89]You do realize there's no choice or anything in here, right?
[20:22.25]If I'd said Stanley walked past the broom closet, at least you would have had a reason for exploring it to find out.
[20:29.10]But it didn't even occur to me because literally this closet is of absolutely no significance to the story whatsoever.
[20:37.00]Oh, yeah, that joke.
[20:37.90]I never would have thought to mention it.
[20:39.65]Oh, there it goes.
[20:41.11]Out of the park.
[20:44.51]Oh, yes, I'm in a board meeting, and we're awful shitty people.
[20:47.79]Oh, there it goes.
[20:48.71]See you later.
[20:49.82]I hope your friends find this concerning.
[21:08.67]Don't read AutoMod, I'm not... Hey!
[21:10.31]Also, Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers.
[21:12.85]Well, I've come to a very definite conclusion about what's going on right now.
[21:16.39]You're dead.
[21:31.80]You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit, and were just about to leave because there's nothing here.
[21:36.73]Am I dead in here?
[21:37.35]When a physical malady of some sort shut down your central nervous system and you collapsed on the keyboard.
[21:43.85]Well, in a situation like this, the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby so as to ensure that your body is taken care of before it begins to decompose.
[21:54.01]Hello?
[21:54.81]Anyone who happens to be nearby?
[21:56.63]The person at this computer is dead.
[21:59.91]They have fallen prey to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities.
[22:05.15]It's indicative of the long-term sustainability of your species.
[22:09.19]Please remove their corpse from the area and instruct another human to take their place, making sure they understand basic first-person video game mechanics and filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in video gaming.
[22:23.76]so that the irony and insightful commentary of this game is not lost on them.
[22:30.05]Alright.
[22:30.73]When you've done that, just step out into the hallway.
[22:34.33]Oh, dude, look at that one!
[22:38.45]Oh, that goes in the left field!
[22:48.58]What if I don't go anywhere?
[22:49.40]Oh, he's fucking killing it today!
[23:03.02]Do I actually just... I might just die in here.
[23:13.77]How many layers is the irony stream right now?
[23:16.73]Glad somebody got it.
[23:20.49]You understand.
[23:21.23]You understand comedy.
[23:31.92]I don't want to leave, though.
[23:33.02]I kind of want to... Can anything happen in here?
[23:36.12]Ah, second player.
[23:37.26]It's good to have you on board.
[23:38.86]I guarantee you can't do any worse than the person who came before you.
[23:44.80]You too?
[23:46.36]Unbelievable.
[23:47.40]I'm at the mercy of an entire species of invalids.
[23:50.72]Perhaps there's a monkey nearby you can hand the controls to.
[23:53.75]A fish?
[23:54.63]Fungus?
[23:55.55]Look, you can hammer out the details.
[23:57.25]I'm not particularly picky.
[23:58.85]I'll just be waiting for when you're ready to pick up the story again.
[24:02.07]Really?
[24:02.37]Okay.
[24:03.23]So what if I do it a third time?
[24:04.31]Nah, I can't do it a third time.
[24:15.56]Maybe I can.
[24:16.08]Shit.
[24:17.24]Now I went downstairs.
[24:37.10]Have a flashlight?
[24:37.70]Stanley just couldn't do it.
[24:39.78]He considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.
[24:45.30]He might be fired for that.
[24:47.37]And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk?
[24:51.43]All because he believed everyone had vanished?
[24:54.75]His boss would think he was crazy.
[24:57.17]And then something occurred to Stanley.
[24:59.40]Maybe, he thought to himself,
[25:01.22]Maybe I am crazy.
[25:03.46]All of my coworkers blinking mysteriously out of existence in a single moment for no reason at all.
[25:10.02]None of it made any logical sense.
[25:12.56]And as Stanley pondered this, he began to make other strange observations.
[25:16.93]For example, why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down?
[25:21.55]Why did doors close automatically behind him wherever he went?
[25:25.13]That's true.
[25:25.77]What's going on here?
[25:26.90]These rooms were starting to look pretty familiar.
[25:29.34]Were they simply repeating?
[25:31.24]No, Stanley said to himself.
[25:32.74]This is all too strange.
[25:34.24]This can't be real.
[25:35.72]and at last he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue he just hadn't found the words for it I'm dreaming yes I'm dreaming one two this is all a dream oh what a relief Stanley felt to finally found an answer an explanation his co-workers weren't actually gone he wasn't going to lose his job he wasn't crazy after all and he thought to himself wake up soon
[26:03.54]I'll have to go back to my boring real-life job pushing buttons.
[26:07.08]I may as well enjoy this while I'm still lucid.
[26:10.82]So, he imagined himself flying and began to gently float above the ground.
[26:16.96]Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical star field.
[26:22.14]And it too appeared it was so much fun.
[26:25.42]And Stanley marveled that he had still not woken up.
[26:28.87]How was he remaining so lucid?
[26:31.46]And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head.
[26:36.14]One he was amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner.
[26:39.61]Why is there a voice in my head dictating everything that I'm doing and thinking?
[26:45.66]Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley, who found it particularly strange.
[26:50.76]What the fuck?
[26:51.76]I'm dreaming about a voice describing me, thinking about how it's describing my thoughts, he thought.
[26:58.78]And while he thought it all very odd... That just reminded me of like a YouTubers or Twitch streamers play the game compilation that sometimes people make like devs or like companies or whatever.
[27:09.25]Was Stanley simply deceiving himself?
[27:11.09]Believing that if he's asleep, he doesn't have to take responsibility for himself?
[27:15.15]That's the cut.
[27:15.71]Stanley is as awake right now as he's ever been in his life.
[27:21.00]Now hearing the voice speak these words.
[27:22.68]So where do I go?
[27:23.36]Shocked at Stanley.
[27:25.02]After all, he knew for certain beyond a doubt that this was in fact a dream.
[27:29.68]Did the voice not see him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago?
[27:33.43]How else would the voice explain all that?
[27:35.55]This voice was a part of himself too.
[27:37.81]Surely, surely if he could just...
[27:40.97]He would prove it.
[27:42.41]He would prove that he was in control, that this was a dream.
[27:47.47]So he closed his eyes gently and he invited himself to wake up.
[27:51.68]This works.
[27:52.54]He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin, the press of the mattress on his back.
[27:57.72]Can you guys change channels?
[27:58.68]I can.
[27:58.94]Fresh air of a world outside this one.
[28:02.87]Let me wake up, he thought to himself.
[28:06.21]I'm through with this dream.
[28:08.13]I wish it to be over.
[28:10.29]Let me go back to my job.
[28:12.53]Let me continue pushing the buttons.
[28:14.90]Please, it's all I want.
[28:17.84]I want my apartment and my wife and my job.
[28:22.52]All I want is my life exactly the way it's always been.
[28:27.43]my life is normal I am normal everything will be fine I am okay so um it's not a dream Stanley began screaming
[28:47.81]Please someone wake me up.
[28:49.71]My name is Stanley.
[28:51.15]I have a boss.
[28:51.89]I have an office.
[28:52.87]I am real.
[28:53.77]Please just someone tell me I'm real.
[28:56.15]I must be real.
[28:57.13]I must be.
[28:57.73]Can anyone hear my voice?
[28:59.35]Who am I?
[29:00.11]Who am I?
[29:02.84]And everything went black.
[29:10.08]This is the story of a woman named Mariella.
[29:15.34]Mariela woke up on a day like any other.
[29:18.02]She arose, got dressed, gathered her belongings, and walked to her place of work.
[29:22.56]What?
[29:23.13]But on this particular day, her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who had stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself.
[29:30.83]Wait, what?
[29:31.25]And collapsed dead on the sidewalk.
[29:33.57]And although she would soon turn to go call for an ambulance, for just a few brief moments, she considered the strange man.
[29:41.33]He was obviously crazy, this much she knew.
[29:44.77]Everyone knows what crazy looks like.
[29:47.35]And in that moment, she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal.
[29:52.22]I am sane.
[29:53.02]I am in control of my mind.
[29:56.68]I know what is real and what isn't.
[30:00.06]It was comforting to think this, and in a certain way, seeing this man made her feel better.
[30:06.08]But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled for that day, the very important people whose impressions of her would affect her career, and by extension, the rest of her life.
[30:17.00]She had no time for this, so it was only a moment that she stood there, staring down at the body.
[30:24.03]And then she turned and ran.
[30:26.47]What happened to me?
[30:31.12]Why did I just die?
[30:32.16]Why would I just die?
[30:33.02]Okay.
[30:37.55]Well, we're not going down there again.
[30:39.41]I gotta... Hmm.
[30:39.69]Oh, this time I'm going right.
[30:40.57]Okay.
[30:40.69]We're going... No, we're going left again.
[30:42.87]We're going left.
[31:06.47]Yet there was not a single person here either.
[31:09.69]Feeling a wave of disbelief.
[31:11.49]Yep, and then I could go upstairs.
[31:13.65]Remember this one?
[31:14.67]I remember this one.
[31:15.90]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:17.92]Not again.
[31:18.44]I won't be part of this.
[31:19.36]I'm not going to encourage you.
[31:20.76]I'm not going to say anything at all.
[31:23.14]I'm just going to be patient and wait for you to finish whatever it is you enjoy doing so much in this room.
[31:29.27]Please take your time.
[31:39.51]I'm such a little... I'm such a good toddler.
[31:44.15]I didn't do it!
[31:45.07]Alright, let's go up.
[31:45.69]Weird office.
[31:46.17]Executive bathroom.
[32:02.23]Because the boss knows that what the boss says goes.
[32:05.31]If the boss suffered losses, then that's what the boss chose.
[32:09.37]Who wrote this?
[32:16.38]No toilet next to a window.
[32:20.70]I'm sorry, I don't want... I don't care how high up I am.
[32:24.77]No thanks.
[32:25.17]You know, I feel the same exact way about the hotel room.
[32:32.26]Look at this big curtain.
[32:34.47]Wow, look at this.
[32:35.33]All the view.
[32:35.83]You can see, like, the whole city from here.
[32:37.97]I close that shit immediately.
[32:42.61]Close it immediately.
[32:45.45]I don't want that open.
[32:47.85]What if you... It's like taking a shit... What if you're, like, naked?
[32:49.85]I close that.
[32:50.81]I don't fucking... That freaks me out so much.
[32:52.65]I hate that.
[32:53.07]Oh, there's just a huge window here.
[32:57.29]I don't want to even look in my fucking hotel room.
[32:59.61]I don't want to look in my bathroom.
[33:00.95]Like, what the fuck is this?
[33:06.42]You want a good, you want a view.
[33:08.32]Alright, here.
[33:09.32]Install like a little Wizard of Oz slider.
[33:11.86]You know, like, where much can land?
[33:13.40]No, you can't come in here.
[33:15.03]Just like a, so you can just put your eyes out.
[33:17.81]Whoa, wow, that's cool.
[33:18.93]This does the same thing.
[33:22.97]It does the exact same thing.
[33:29.48]We don't need all this.
[33:36.96]Show your pants?
[33:37.74]No, no, I can't.
[33:39.46]I can't.
[33:40.14]I can't.
[33:40.74]I can't.
[33:41.96]I can't show you my pants.
[33:44.49]Alright, fine.
[33:45.79]Okay.
[33:46.47]Alright, fine.
[33:49.03]Alright, fine.
[33:49.83]Alright, it's... It's... It's Super Mario, okay?
[33:58.12]Can you see?
[34:00.20]See?
[34:09.04]They're Super Mario pajamas, okay?
[34:11.56]Are you happy?
[34:12.94]Are you happy?
[34:13.50]Okay?
[34:15.60]They're Super Mario pajamas.
[34:31.79]Don't you guys get it?
[34:33.91]You just have to be presentable from here up.
[34:40.55]I just have, my fly is not down, it's buttoned.
[34:46.55]You know how many times I've had a nice shirt on and wearing like in little like pajama like shorts?
[34:59.42]A lot.
[35:04.03]All that matters is like this camera right here, right?
[35:06.79]That's all that matters.
[35:16.25]Holy shit Okay, I didn't think that was a panda until like a second ago the nose of the panda I thought was a mouth going like this like
[35:42.28]I didn't and the the black I thought was a background I was like what is that I thought it was like a a face the nose is like a open kind of mouth I that was weird you can see it yeah of course you can no I'm not going up there not yet
[36:11.04]Anything else I can touch in here?
[36:12.42]Anything I can do?
[36:14.38]No.
[36:15.67]What about over here?
[36:19.99]Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.
[36:26.85]Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this.
[36:31.95]What dark secret was being held from him?
[36:34.85]What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him.
[36:43.25]And so the boss had assigned it an extra secret
[36:46.59]Hmm, really?
[36:48.14]Oh.
[36:48.20]How did he get it?
[37:07.02]Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs.
[37:09.92]Trying to input anything on the device was useless, since he could never possibly know that the combination was 2845.
[37:17.17]I don't know.
[37:23.66]I can't get it.
[37:25.30]2845.
[37:25.66]I don't know.
[37:27.58]I'm not supposed to be listening to you.
[37:33.00]Um, you could pull this whole room forward in The Sims building tool, and it's still the office is fine.
[37:40.44]What's the point of all this?
[37:42.66]Just go over here.
[37:43.68]What the fuck?
[38:03.80]I got it!
[38:15.59]What was he hiding?
[38:18.27]What's this big secret?
[38:24.20]It's really dark, I can't see anything.
[38:30.42]What's the secret?
[38:35.27]You don't want to know, man.
[38:42.41]Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar.
[38:47.35]It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature of his job.
[38:55.45]Why did he feel this now, when for years it had never occurred to him?
[39:00.32]This question would not go unanswered for long.
[39:08.70]Stanley noticed that there was a place to jump halfway down the elevator.
[39:12.86]He jumped very excitedly, landed on the ledge, and was disappointed to find it was just a grace mimic.
[39:18.98]Just a grace mimic!
[39:24.52]Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read, Mind Control Facility.
[39:47.09]Is this where I put the helmet on and see all the mutants?
[39:58.54]The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.
[40:02.72]What horrible secret did this place hold, Stanley thought to himself.
[40:07.39]Did he have the strength to find out?
[40:11.43]What's going on here?
[40:13.49]Hold on.
[40:14.47]For the streamer and YouTuber, super cut.
[40:16.71]Hold on.
[40:19.33]I gotta make a good one.
[40:20.27]Make sure I get on it.
[40:20.89]Whoa!
[40:29.84]Whoa!
[40:37.88]That wasn't good enough.
[40:38.96]That was not good enough.
[40:40.20]I can't swear, you're right.
[40:41.64]No, I can swear, but they'll do this.
[40:42.92]It'll be like...
[41:15.48]I always find, like, censoring, like, fuck.
[41:19.34]Or, like, shit.
[41:22.14]It's like, you hear the first two letters and the last letter.
[41:25.79]It's like, what a... You're just essentially censoring a letter.
[41:31.67]Like, Freddy, for instance.
[41:35.01]Like, you... Why does it matter?
[41:36.91]Fuck.
[41:44.32]Fuck.
[41:45.28]Right?
[41:45.66]Like, it doesn't matter.
[41:47.74]You literally, like, shit.
[41:49.90]Shit.
[41:51.00]Shit.
[41:52.00]You know what I'm saying?
[41:53.03]Like, it's just, literally the I in shit is being removed.
[41:56.45]Who cares?
[41:58.51]It doesn't make any sense.
[42:05.06]Kids will learn.
[42:09.33]Get your kids off of YouTube immediately.
[42:12.69]Right now.
[42:13.81]Get your kids off of YouTube now.
[42:16.01]Like, do it today.
[42:17.03]Get them off there immediately.
[42:18.33]And get them out of here, too.
[42:22.34]Get them out of here.
[42:23.58]You don't want them here.
[42:24.12]It was too horrible to believe.
[42:25.80]It couldn't be true.
[42:27.40]Had Stanley really been under someone's control all this time?
[42:31.08]Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job?
[42:34.18]That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?
[42:40.36]No, we need much more high-quality children's television.
[42:43.14]Okay?
[42:46.78]We need... Children's television, like, and children's content.
[42:51.24]Like, holy shit.
[42:52.24]What a disaster.
[42:52.86]Can you imagine?
[42:55.59]Otto.
[42:57.17]Otto's Grotto.
[43:00.05]Like, one of the segments.
[43:01.55]It's like Otto sitting at a table.
[43:02.75]And it's like a counting segment.
[43:05.51]You know, like, and there's five treats on the table.
[43:10.54]And it's like, oh, Otto, hey, can you count with us, Otto?
[43:14.34]He's like, yeah, I can count with you.
[43:15.60]Absolutely.
[43:15.94]My name's Otto.
[43:17.16]He's like, Otto, how many treats are on the table?
[43:19.49]And he goes, one, two, three, four.
[43:26.05]Otto, count again, Otto.
[43:29.35]Try again.
[43:30.01]No, there's four.
[43:32.61]One, two, three.
[43:34.79]And then he eats the fifth one.
[43:36.92]Four.
[43:38.18]Then it goes like this.
[43:42.06]And then it like zooms in and it's like a cute thing.
[43:48.60]How do we teach kids counting?
[43:49.24]This is getting intense, man.
[44:21.45]Whoa, incest.
[44:40.02]Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human life.
[44:47.35]For he would dismantle the controls once and for all.
[44:53.43]Could I turn it on?
[45:00.41]I'm sorry.
[45:02.31]Not before my morning coffee.
[45:04.39]I don't do anything before my coffee.
[45:07.45]I'll come back.
[45:17.37]And when at last he found the source of the room's power, he knew it was his duty, his obligation, to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood for.
[45:45.98]Can I change this to, like, do have it be, like, eat, like, 20% more vegetables?
[45:54.47]Like, can I just make it that?
[46:05.98]What if it was just, like, like, cigarettes are gross.
[46:11.62]Right?
[46:12.00]Like, oh, cigarettes are gross.
[46:13.54]Yeah, cigarettes are gross.
[46:14.66]And eat 10% more broccoli.
[46:23.27]Hey, that was loud.
[46:30.47]Let people decide that on their own.
[46:32.01]I'm fucking kidding.
[46:36.58]blackness and a rising chill of uncertainty.
[46:40.13]I turned it off.
[46:41.81]Was it over?
[46:47.43]Yes.
[46:48.97]He had won.
[46:50.36]He had defeated the machine, unshackled himself from someone else's command.
[46:56.20]Freedom was mere moments away.
[46:59.57]And yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved.
[47:07.98]Where had his co-workers gone?
[47:10.68]How had he been freed from the machine's grasp?
[47:13.88]What other mysteries did this strange building hold?
[47:17.22]But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realized none of this mattered to him, for it was not knowledge or even power that he had been seeking.
[47:27.26]but happiness.
[47:28.58]Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go.
[47:33.74]No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel.
[47:39.58]Whatever life he lives, it will be his.
[47:43.53]And that was all he needed to know.
[47:46.31]It was perhaps the only thing worth knowing.
[47:50.35]Stanley stepped through the open door.
[47:58.88]Can I like mind control myself to know way more than I do?
[48:04.23]Like if I go put, if I go like go to that machine and I was like, I'm going to mind control myself and to know like every language.
[48:09.87]Could that work?
[48:17.30]It's not like the matrix.
[48:18.68]No, it wouldn't.
[48:20.64]That's the matrix.
[48:27.85]Alright, but, okay, what if I was like, I was in the mind control machine, and somebody walked over and was like, you now know every language on Earth.
[48:37.04]What would happen?
[48:39.46]Would I come out of it?
[48:40.22]Like, I come out of the machine, and I'm just like, I don't know.
[48:45.69]What do I do?
[48:46.93]Would you know?
[48:47.45]Wouldn't it not work?
[48:51.91]Stanley felt the cool breeze upon his skin, the feeling of liberation.
[48:56.82]But what would you think?
[48:58.80]You would think you knew every language on Earth.
[49:01.48]This was exactly the way, right now, that things were meant to happen.
[49:07.20]That's fucking funny.
[49:08.06]And Stanley was happy.
[49:13.19]So would I be, would I pretend to understand French?
[49:29.84]What when people were like, say something to me in French?
[49:35.30]What would I do?
[49:35.84]Alright, let's go.
[49:40.31]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room to check on his coworkers.
[49:43.81]He never functioned well by himself.
[49:45.73]Alright, so we're going to go.
[49:46.37]Constantly needed support and guidance from others.
[49:48.85]I'm going to go.
[49:49.27]Should I turn on the machine?
[49:50.49]Solitude was terrifying to him.
[49:56.47]You wouldn't know any new languages, but everyone else thinks you do.
[49:59.33]What?
[49:59.45]Alright, I just... I wanna... It's not... I'm on.
[50:00.69]I wanna go see what happens.
[50:16.71]Yet, there was not a single person here either.
[50:19.89]Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.
[50:26.88]That's funny.
[50:29.04]That's funny.
[50:30.68]Good one.
[50:31.28]That's a good one.
[50:33.54]Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office.
[50:37.89]I want to go up because I want to press the other button.
[50:50.17]Wait, where does this go?
[50:51.13]I didn't do this.
[51:11.38]I remember I was in an elevator one time.
[51:14.66]And this mom and her little girl came in.
[51:19.28]And we were just going down the elevator.
[51:21.87]And the mom was not paying attention.
[51:23.69]And the little girl went like this, walking with her finger pointing.
[51:28.91]Right towards just going for a button.
[51:32.61]And she was going for the emergency bell button.
[51:37.50]And it was just in slow motion.
[51:39.02]I was just like...
[51:41.64]Oh no!
[51:43.30]And it was... She pressed it and it went like... And for one second.
[51:49.53]And it was just like, holy shit!
[51:52.89]And then we got off the elevator and nothing happened.
[51:56.41]It was like, what the fuck?
[51:58.71]What's going on?
[52:05.04]That's a fake story?
[52:06.30]That's not a fake story.
[52:09.72]I didn't just make that up.
[52:10.81]Why would I make that up?
[52:12.05]Why would I make up a stupid elevator story where a little kid presses like the bell button for like the ring the emergency button?
[52:19.49]Why would I make that up?
[52:21.29]There's no reason.
[52:22.29]What do I gain from making that up?
[52:33.58]What's that?
[52:36.79]Huh?
[52:37.21]Wait.
[52:43.03]It was a funny stream moment.
[52:47.36]Alright, get me out.
[52:54.08]What the fuck is going on?
[52:55.02]Go up.
[52:59.23]Go up.
[53:12.82]What are you doing?
[53:13.80]I can't sing on the elevator.
[53:38.83]Are you pretending?
[53:42.34]so I probably just have to sit here for a minute
[54:18.05]Alright, I did it.
[54:18.85]Blow some bubbles?
[54:20.41]Uh, they're not here.
[54:41.97]You fail to comprehend the joke.
[54:54.22]What?
[54:54.70]Wasting someone's time is a joke?
[54:57.24]Wasting my valuable time is funny?
[54:59.54]That's funny?
[55:00.17]Wasting my time?
[55:01.85]I just wasted my time.
[55:04.07]That was a waste of my time.
[55:07.67]That's funny.
[55:11.07]This new generation does not fucking... whatever.
[55:17.79]Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.
[55:25.53]What could it mean?
[55:27.09]Stanley wondered aloud to nobody.
[55:30.13]He began wildly.
[55:31.15]Stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible.
[55:34.98]He didn't even have a single minute to just let the narrator talk.
[55:39.48]That kind of anxiety isn't healthy.
[55:41.60]So he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age music.
[55:47.10]Hey, no!
[55:49.06]But I don't, you know what I don't like?
[55:52.38]When someone deliberately wastes my fucking time.
[55:55.84]Again, right?
[55:57.40]Honey, right?
[55:59.08]Feeling soothed and rejuvenated, Stanley calmly walked forward into the opened passageway.
[56:09.26]Uh-oh, here comes the streamer ego.
[56:11.38]Okay, so I'm gonna press the other button.
[56:18.78]You wasted all of our time when you played this strawberry game.
[56:25.35]That's different though, that was funny.
[56:30.17]That's different, that was funny.
[56:32.49]That's a lot different.
[56:40.15]Oh, yeah?
[56:41.21]You wasted my time by having to make me put a poll up every 15 seconds to get 85% of you to keep confirming to keep playing the game.
[56:50.12]That was wasting my time.
[56:51.10]We're even.
[56:55.30]Stanley walks straight ahead through the large door that read Mind Control Facility.
[56:59.82]Alright, do I press the on button or do I go this?
[57:02.50]Let's go this way.
[57:05.79]Although this passageway had the word escape written on it,
[57:09.14]The truth was that at the end of this hall, Stanley would meet his violent death.
[57:13.65]Your mods were doing it.
[57:14.73]It wasn't even you.
[57:20.64]The door behind him was not shut.
[57:22.69]Yeah, and... And, like, going to my other monitor and typing each letter to say, run another... Holy God, my fucking hands hurt after that.
[57:38.13]My fingers are so delicate.
[57:41.45]I'm wasting my time.
[57:43.52]At this point, Stanley was making a conscious, concerted effort to walk forward and willingly confront his death.
[57:52.33]Delicate.
[57:55.19]Do I actually just die if I go in here?
[57:56.51]Is there sprint?
[58:09.32]Everyone's calling me a coward.
[58:14.45]Hey Jeremy, jump in this hole and it'll grind you up into a thousand pieces.
[58:19.62]No.
[58:20.56]Coward.
[58:20.88]You're a fucking coward.
[58:23.68]Okay.
[58:32.27]Do it, Giga Chad.
[58:33.43]Oh, well, now that I'm gonna be a Giga Chad, of course I will.
[58:43.96]Jesus.
[58:44.26]I thought I was supposed to die.
[58:45.79]Oh shit, it's gonna squish me.
[58:50.37]Worthless.
[58:50.65]I took a man to a graveyard.
[59:06.70]I'm good.
[59:28.45]Farewell, Stanley, cried the narrator, as Stanley was led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws.
[59:35.59]In a single visceral instant, Stanley was obliterated as the machine crushed every bone in his body, killing him instantly.
[59:44.11]No, it didn't.
[59:53.07]It's too dark, I can't see.
[60:01.90]A movie?
[60:03.25]And yet it would be just a few minutes before Stanley would restart the game back in his office as alive as ever.
[60:09.90]Why is there a different narrator?
[60:11.24]What exactly did the narrator think he was going to accomplish?
[60:13.96]Dude, this only happens in the pirated version.
[60:32.11]Really?
[60:32.37]No.
[60:50.36]Office layout.
[60:51.00]This blueprint shows the office from the beginning of the game.
[60:54.40]Path, from Stanley's office to the two doors, was the first part of the game that was built.
[60:58.98]Sections have been added and altered throughout development, but the core layout remains almost identical to the first iteration.
[61:07.53]What the f- What the f- This is insane.
[61:17.85]That's the one.
[61:22.61]The pacing of this opening section was important to get right.
[61:25.83]This corridor has been moved and altered to make sure the player reaches the two doors in good time.
[61:34.27]Interesting.
[61:38.62]Filing cabinets.
[61:41.46]Cool.
[61:43.32]Office computers.
[61:45.40]Oh.
[61:48.83]Employee database.
[61:50.13]Huh?
[61:53.09]Paintings!
[61:56.97]Look at this tuber.
[61:59.21]Nature paintings.
[62:01.75]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[62:04.47]And the credits of the game.
[62:11.77]What are these, buttons?
[62:13.89]Oh, Otto, how many buttons are there?
[62:15.93]Well, there's one, two, three, four, and there's four buttons.
[62:23.09]Oh, was there a cookie behind you?
[62:29.29]Nice job.
[62:30.59]Nice job.
[62:33.50]Nice job to all of you.
[62:34.98]Nice job.
[62:36.62]Actually, great work.
[62:37.34]Like, for real, this game's cool.
[62:38.92]Alright, so where do I go?
[62:39.50]This way?
[62:39.74]I'm gonna go over here.
[62:50.77]Maintenance room.
[62:54.71]I've played so much Elden Ring that in my brain, there's an item right there.
[63:01.20]There's a little glowy thing right there behind that.
[63:05.80]You did it, you solved it.
[63:06.60]Not really.
[63:11.53]Early in development, we designed an ending where Stanley would end up on a battlefield fighting aliens.
[63:16.05]The action game would become sentient and would wage war against the narrator.
[63:21.21]We realized shortly after starting to build it that it was far too jokey and on-the-nose for the tone of the game.
[63:27.25]Plus, some people interpreted it as making fun of people who liked shooters, which was not our intention.
[63:34.94]That would have been... That would have been kind of crazy.
[63:40.44]Ultra Deluxe Announcements.
[63:41.62]In December 2018, we announced the Ultra Deluxe version of The Stanley Parable at the Game Awards.
[63:47.24]These are screenshots of the videos we made for the announcement and the game's delay.
[63:55.30]Cool.
[64:00.10]The office.
[64:01.69]The lounge.
[64:07.91]The cargo lift.
[64:10.15]Why am I expecting a bunch of little chat bubbles around here that I can click on, and all of a sudden it's just like,
[64:16.93]And that's why we decided, when we delayed it by a year or two, that when we finally got it on Steam, we were going to make sure that me, GabeN, would personally announce the games listing on Steam.
[64:28.46]Like, I feel like I'm looking for those.
[64:34.61]Four.
[64:34.85]Is this going to explode?
[64:56.87]I don't want to see that.
[64:58.06]That's spoilers.
[64:58.72]Maybe just a peek.
[65:04.14]Maintenance layout.
[65:10.26]There's a lot of stuff here.
[65:11.43]What is going on?
[65:12.53]Why did that make my eye itch?
[65:18.53]Zending levers.
[65:19.81]Part of the zending.
[65:21.99]The player would pull a lever and the narrator would describe what color they pulled.
[65:25.98]These are all spoilers.
[65:27.26]Ah, the zending layer.
[65:28.69]The zending model.
[65:31.07]What's zending?
[65:32.67]What does zending mean?
[65:33.67]I don't want to see that.
[65:38.49]Countdown desk.
[65:40.33]No, this is- I don't want to see this.
[65:41.43]Freedom ending.
[65:43.11]Yeah, I saw that.
[65:43.73]Okay, I know that one.
[65:45.53]Yeah, alright, let me get out of here.
[65:46.41]I don't want to see this.
[65:47.87]You're wasting time.
[65:48.85]You're wasting our time.
[65:53.27]Oh, please.
[65:57.34]Alright, let's do it.
[65:58.46]Stop stalling.
[66:00.36]Oh, look at these two.
[66:02.20]How they wish to destroy one another.
[66:05.12]How they wish to control one another.
[66:07.92]How they both wish to be free.
[66:09.98]I feel like I'm going to do this and the room that's black is going to lighten up and I'm like zapping somebody in the electric chair.
[66:28.74]It's like, look at what you did.
[66:29.88]No, perhaps not.
[66:33.98]Sometimes these things cannot be seen.
[66:46.24]But listen to me.
[66:47.34]You can still save these two.
[66:49.22]You can stop the program before they both fail.
[66:52.54]Push escape and press quit.
[66:54.55]There's no other way to beat this game.
[66:57.33]As long as you move forward, you'll be walking someone else's path.
[67:00.77]Stop now and it'll be your only true choice.
[67:03.85]Whatever you do, choose it.
[67:05.79]Don't let time choose for you.
[67:07.71]Don't let... Got it.
[67:19.83]Begin the game again Pretty much He was supposed to quit
[67:41.94]What?
[67:43.04]I thought I was supposed to quit the game?
[67:44.96]I missed the ending, I was supposed to quit.
[67:47.33]When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[67:55.37]Let's defy!
[67:56.91]This was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well.
[68:01.42]Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just to admire it.
[68:05.78]Mmm!
[68:11.81]It's truly a room worth admiring.
[68:14.37]It had really been worth the detour after all, just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate, beautifully constructed room.
[68:21.52]Stanley simply stood here, drinking it all in.
[68:24.12]Like, are these free?
[68:28.81]Why?
[68:32.74]yes really really worth it being here in the room a room so utterly captivating that even though all your co-workers have mysteriously vanished here you sit looking at these chairs and some paintings really worth it I mean I'm just checking it out man stop trying to rush me
[68:54.74]At this point, Stanley's obsession with this room bordered on creepy and reflected poorly on his overall personality.
[69:01.27]I'm just trying.
[69:01.81]It's possible that this is why everyone left.
[69:06.87]You're wasting time.
[69:08.83]You're wasting the narrator's time.
[69:12.79]Stanley sat around waiting for more dialogue, but when a long time had passed and there was no more, he decided that the game was trying to send him a message.
[69:37.86]Nope.
[69:38.00]I'm not going in there.
[69:43.71]I'm going to look in there and see what's in there, but I'm not going in.
[70:04.78]Stanley was so bad at following directions, it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago.
[70:09.27]What's this?
[70:15.29]Omega low.
[70:24.10]Warning, do not jump from the cargo lift while it is in motion.
[70:26.52]It will cause death.
[70:30.82]Penalties.
[70:32.79]Can I go in here?
[70:35.29]Need a credit card.
[70:43.01]Look, Stanley, I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.
[70:46.59]But in his eagerness to prove that he is in control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do, Stanley left from the platform and plunged to his death.
[70:55.92]Good job, Stanley.
[70:57.38]Everyone thinks you are very powerful.
[71:06.01]All of his co-workers were gone.
[71:08.05]What could it mean?
[71:09.55]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[71:11.55]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[71:18.25]I'm just seeing what happens.
[71:19.21]Could be a lie.
[71:19.75]When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, this was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well.
[71:26.24]Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just to admire it.
[71:31.42]Best burp of the year?
[71:31.90]What a dumb category.
[71:32.48]Okay, so here we go.
[71:34.48]So go on the thing and don't follow.
[71:53.36]Look, Stanley, I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.
[71:55.84]What if I do it again?
[71:56.91]What if I do it again?
[71:57.37]I'm not your enemy, really, I'm not.
[71:59.95]But in his eagerness to prove that he is in control of the story, I just wanted something to change.
[72:05.49]Stanley leapt from the platform and plunged to his death.
[72:09.37]Good job, Stanley.
[72:10.07]Alright, I just didn't, I didn't know, I, sometimes there's something different.
[72:16.21]I don't know, it could have been like, Stanley realized that they... Yeah, I don't know, it could have been like, oh, Stanley realized that the AI had not loaded in the fall damage yet.
[72:22.01]I don't know, who knows?
[72:23.17]This is a game, this is a weird game.
[72:48.46]You never know.
[72:51.06]When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, this was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well.
[72:57.52]Maybe three times.
[72:58.38]Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just to admire it.
[73:02.50]No, I'm not doing it a third time.
[73:04.16]The lounge was sublime.
[73:06.02]A work of art.
[73:07.28]But eager to get back to business, Stanley took the first open door on his left.
[73:13.18]No.
[73:14.93]I'm gonna go across.
[73:16.22]Stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't five years ago okay let's go look Stanley I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here I'm not your enemy really I'm not everyone I realize that investing every single person is my enemy difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you my enemies time there's someone you've been neglecting Stanley someone you've forgotten what
[73:44.29]Alright.
[73:44.61]Do it.
[73:45.37]Do it then.
[74:13.54]Stop talking about it and do it.
[74:17.96]Danger everywhere.
[74:36.37]Now listen carefully, this is important.
[74:38.80]Stanley walked through the red door.
[74:43.65]What if he kills me?
[74:52.06]He said he wants to prove it.
[74:59.86]Prove it.
[75:00.34]Oh, thank God you are willing to listen to me.
[75:02.56]Prove it now.
[75:03.12]Do you see that I really have wanted you to be happy all this time?
[75:06.46]But you haven't proved it.
[75:07.12]The problem is all these choices.
[75:08.98]The two of us always trying to get somewhere that isn't here.
[75:11.90]Running and running and running just the way you're doing right now.
[75:15.34]Don't you see that it's killing us, Stanley?
[75:17.92]I just, I want it to stop.
[75:20.02]So this is... I would, we would both be so much happier if we just stop.
[75:25.85]You got auto-balanced.
[75:27.71]Well, I think I have a solution.
[75:29.59]Huh?
[75:29.79]What do we want?
[75:55.49]Here, yes.
[75:57.91]Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?
[76:00.17]If we just stay right here, right in this moment with this place, Stanley, I think I feel happy.
[76:09.28]I actually feel happy.
[76:29.81]Whoa!
[76:30.15]Does this do anything else?
[76:58.68]Oh, here comes the green!
[77:01.07]Here comes the green.
[77:01.65]Alright, if this light show is more than $40, I'm leaving a two-star review on Yelp.
[77:33.96]Green tea.
[77:34.72]It is like green tea.
[77:35.56]You're right.
[77:36.32]Green tea.
[77:45.07]Oh, and red for red tea.
[77:49.57]Wow.
[77:54.56]And look, there's peach tea.
[77:58.44]Raspberry tea.
[78:02.12]You guys, wow, you're right.
[78:18.74]Bro, just leave.
[78:19.56]I'm not gonna leave.
[78:20.58]This is... I wanna see what happens.
[78:35.65]He's not gonna leave.
[78:36.77]I'm not gonna leave yet.
[78:37.91]I'm...
[78:40.75]Because this entire video game is just a shitload of moments like Far Cry 4's first 20 minutes.
[78:50.39]Just leave.
[78:51.37]Just leave, bro.
[78:52.19]Go.
[78:52.47]Just leave.
[78:54.11]I'm experiencing the video game that's been crafted.
[78:56.28]Okay, now I'll leave.
[79:09.48]Never listening to you ever again.
[79:15.14]He wasn't done.
[79:16.60]Oh!
[79:45.57]Baby sensory.
[79:52.95]I love watching the videos of people going like... You know what I mean?
[79:58.21]Like... Gunk.
[80:00.54]Gunk.
[80:05.44]I love that.
[80:05.96]Does nobody know what I'm talking about?
[80:19.80]This, the, like the drywall paste stuff, where they go like, they mix it, the, the, I don't know, I forget what it's called.
[80:25.51]There's this thick, like, almost concrete, like, gunk, and they just like, carve, carve, carve, slide, slide, slide, come on.
[80:35.39]Okay.
[80:35.51]Yeah, it's like drywall paste.
[80:50.46]Alright.
[80:50.78]I'll give you five more minutes.
[80:52.44]Five minutes is going to make me go watch something else.
[81:25.83]Bro, there's like 500 billion pieces of fucking media on the internet.
[81:34.61]I'm just one.
[81:35.71]There are more YouTube videos than stars in the sky.
[81:40.54]You got options.
[81:42.00]You got options.
[81:47.56]No.
[81:48.58]What do we talk about?
[81:49.52]You're risking everything we achieved here.
[81:54.45]You heard me before, didn't you?
[81:56.28]You will die.
[81:58.44]What about this isn't getting through to you?
[82:00.22]Oh, but there's the person in chat said they wanted me to hurry up.
[82:04.84]Oh, that chat member.
[82:05.77]Why don't you just ban him?
[82:06.97]Time him out for 10 minutes.
[82:08.39]Stop looking at the negative comments.
[82:12.01]All I... What?
[82:13.19]What?
[82:22.20]Do I just walk off?
[82:23.52]Why am I just walking off?
[82:25.40]Wait, what?
[82:26.30]Oh my god!
[82:27.40]Oh my god!
[82:28.14]Okay.
[82:29.33]I think my legs hurt.
[82:47.47]I think I'm slower.
[82:49.59]How do I get out of here?
[82:50.93]Do I have to just reset?
[83:17.09]How long is the show out there?
[83:18.91]How long is the light show?
[83:20.19]How long is the light show?
[83:21.39]I don't understand.
[83:21.95]Will this kill me?
[83:38.92]Stanley, let's go back to the room.
[83:42.40]Can you do that for me?
[83:43.64]What the fuck?
[83:45.58]I keep... Yes, perhaps you can.
[83:48.98]Apparently I have a lot of health.
[83:50.12]Let me see what I'm talking about.
[83:51.74]Okay, what is it?
[83:55.68]What?
[83:56.34]I know you'll see.
[83:57.68]You'll see that we can't be happy if we leave this place.
[84:01.09]You can see that, can't you?
[84:17.50]Can I walk off of this?
[84:21.38]Just stop moving.
[84:23.70]I've stopped moving for a long time.
[84:35.73]Stop moving!
[84:37.81]Wait, you have to stop moving.
[84:40.65]Looking counts as moving.
[84:43.54]What?
[84:46.38]Do a 360 spin off the catwalk.
[84:55.24]I kind of want to do that.
[85:00.35]I kind of want to do that.
[85:02.35]No, perhaps not.
[85:06.53]Does what- does that actually do anything or are you guys just fucking with me?
[85:16.58]No, I didn't- No!
[85:17.96]I ju- I- no.
[85:38.06]It doesn't work.
[85:38.60]Alright.
[85:38.82]I'm gonna go stand still.
[85:39.58]It doesn't work.
[85:39.96]I apparently have- I'm invincible I guess.
[85:41.42]So we're gonna not move.
[85:42.54]Pick and end him?
[85:43.32]What?
[86:18.84]I'm gonna touch the mouse.
[86:50.35]Bunch of fucking liars.
[87:02.00]Alright, I'm out.
[87:03.18]Bunch of liars.
[87:06.98]I'm not moving the mouse.
[87:12.17]Do I actually have to jump off that?
[87:15.21]Oh, okay.
[88:00.94]okay let's start over I guess is it over let's do anything it's going to restart isn't it I'm going back okay um we starting again okay so I don't go that way
[88:29.91]I'm going to go in the blue door this time.
[88:38.04]Blue door.
[88:38.36]Is this a telephone?
[88:39.28]Well, whatever.
[88:39.94]Answer the phone, whatever.
[88:41.16]I need to go in the blue door.
[88:54.49]No, I didn't.
[88:54.93]Alright, blue door.
[89:13.60]Look, Stanley, I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.
[89:17.54]I'm not your enemy, really, I'm not.
[89:19.98]I realize that investing your trust in someone else can be difficult, but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time.
[89:29.51]There's someone you've been neglecting, Stanley.
[89:32.47]Someone you've forgotten about.
[89:34.69]Please, stop trying.
[89:36.89]Really?
[89:37.87]I'm in the middle of something.
[89:39.32]Do you have zero consideration for others?
[89:42.00]Are you that convinced that I want something bad to happen to you?
[89:45.08]Give me the blue door.
[89:46.14]I don't know how to convince you of this, but I really do want to help you.
[89:50.48]To show you something beautiful.
[89:52.15]Look, let me prove it.
[89:54.13]Let me prove that I'm on your side.
[89:56.73]Give me a chance.
[89:57.79]Blue.
[89:58.27]Now listen carefully.
[89:59.17]This is important.
[90:00.67]Stanley walked through the red door.
[90:04.76]Aha.
[90:05.50]Perhaps you misunderstood.
[90:07.14]Stanley walked through the red door.
[90:12.29]I still don't think we're communicating properly.
[90:15.05]Stanley walked through the red door.
[90:19.33]Alright, fine.
[90:20.27]Go ahead, Stanley.
[90:21.58]You want to know so badly what's out there?
[90:23.76]You want to find out what lies at the end of this road you've chosen?
[90:27.10]Well, don't let me stop you.
[90:32.80]You see, there's nothing here.
[90:35.16]I haven't even finished building this section of the map because you were never supposed to be here in the first place.
[90:40.31]Broken rooms, exposed developer textures.
[90:43.03]Is this what you had wanted?
[90:44.63]Was it worth ruining the entire story?
[90:47.48]Specifically for you?
[90:49.74]Do you not think I put a lot of time into that?
[90:51.74]Because I did.
[90:52.96]And in the end, it was all for nothing.
[90:54.82]Because this is what you wanted to see.
[90:57.12]Help me here, Stanley.
[90:58.22]Help elucidate these strange and unknowable desires of yours.
[91:01.96]What would have made this game better?
[91:03.96]What did you want to see?
[91:05.50]Vehicles?
[91:06.68]Skill trees?
[91:07.92]Work with me.
[91:08.64]You've given me absolutely nothing so far.
[91:11.93]Tell you what.
[91:12.89]Let me take a stab in the dark at a new design and you can give me some feedback.
[91:17.28]There we go.
[91:17.90]A third option.
[91:19.24]This already feels leaps ahead of where we were before.
[91:23.04]Go ahead, Stanley.
[91:24.14]Take it for a spin.
[91:25.22]But should I go in there or should I go one of the other doors?
[91:30.63]I'll try it.
[91:37.73]Please rate your experience.
[91:39.57]I'm going to stop you there.
[91:41.15]Now, tell me about your experience with this new version.
[91:44.54]Would you say that the game benefited from allowing you more choices?
[91:48.48]Feel free to be honest.
[91:50.16]I'm looking for some real critical feedback here.
[91:58.62]A one?
[91:59.30]I mean, I can understand if you had reservations, you saw ways the game could be improved to more fully express itself mechanically and artistically, but a one?
[92:07.72]That's not even helpful.
[92:09.06]What am I supposed to do with that?
[92:11.84]But I guess it isn't my place to judge.
[92:15.02]Here, based on the data from your previous playthrough, I've compiled a new version.
[92:19.73]And to be perfectly candid, I think I've knocked it out of the park with this one.
[92:24.01]Let's take a look.
[92:28.55]Stanley Parable.
[92:29.47]Worldwide leaderboard.
[92:35.45]Worldwide leaderboard?
[92:37.23]21% of players skipped the intro sequence.
[92:45.12]Only the worst 30% of players chose the blue door.
[92:47.98]98% of players... How long does it take you to get to the correct door?
[92:54.17]Compete against others to improve your Stanley Parable career.
[93:00.07]That's funny.
[93:04.61]You see a lot of one-star reviews.
[93:06.53]And you read the review.
[93:07.64]And it's like they forgot a ketchup packet.
[93:19.61]And the server was actually really nice.
[93:21.53]The food was fine.
[93:23.94]They forgot to put a sauce in the bag.
[93:27.16]Oh, fuck this place.
[93:29.24]Hey, I nearly forgot.
[93:30.18]I've got a prototype of a new game I've been working on, and now would be a lovely opportunity to give it some playtesting.
[93:36.41]You wouldn't mind taking a look at it, would you?
[93:37.93]Sure.
[93:38.39]Perfect.
[93:39.05]Let me boot it up.
[93:42.12]In this game, the baby crawls left towards danger.
[93:45.82]You click the button to move him back to the right, and if he reaches the fire, you fail.
[93:51.61]It's a very meaningful game, all about the desperation and tedium of endlessly confronting the demands of family life.
[93:58.86]I think the art world will really take notice.
[94:02.22]But of course, the message of the game only becomes clear once you've been playing it for about four hours.
[94:07.78]Okay.
[94:08.02]So why don't you give it four hours of play to make sure it's effective?
[94:11.70]So rescue baby.
[94:12.33]Be sure to keep notes on your experience.
[94:20.91]It's so loud.
[94:23.53]It's too loud.
[94:30.16]How long do I...
[94:35.45]I don't, I don't, I don't like this.
[94:37.35]I don't like it.
[94:37.91]I don't, a baby sounds.
[94:40.38]You can do this for, I'm not doing it.
[94:41.44]I don't care.
[94:44.92]You heartless bastard.
[94:47.46]Did you do it because you hate babies or purely to spite me?
[94:51.38]Because if it's the latter, well, I don't know what to do.
[94:53.36]I'm completely out of ideas.
[94:55.06]I can't think of a single thing that might improve the experience for me.
[94:59.25]I'm not even going to try.
[95:00.71]I'm out I'm out I'm done no it's over what thank you for playing your input was extremely valuable refund hey since my game was so awful why don't we play someone else's game just to ease the pain let's see what do we have here yes this seems like it'll work let's give it a shot
[95:28.72]What?
[95:28.86]Is this Firewatch?
[95:49.07]Okay.
[95:50.15]I think you're gonna see your asshole.
[96:30.92]I love the... Okay, somebody just said, what?
[96:33.26]With like three question marks.
[96:37.50]You need a little bit of context.
[96:39.09]Go to youtube.com slash Jerma985.
[96:41.39]It's an old channel.
[96:44.27]And go look for a video called The Photos Are In.
[96:49.47]You might, like, unfollow the channel after watching that video.
[96:55.55]Right?
[96:55.77]Should I tell people to go watch that?
[96:56.89]I mean, it's like my favorite video, but... I mean, like, should I be telling people to do that?
[97:10.46]What is this?
[97:11.43]Hey!
[97:17.04]Oh, thank goodness, Stanley.
[97:19.36]What a close call.
[97:21.06]You nearly wandered off into that thing.
[97:24.18]That big, open, just wandering around.
[97:26.67]No right or wrong directions.
[97:28.43]No path to follow.
[97:29.39]You can just go in any... Oh, thank heavens we avoided it.
[97:35.79]We're out of the woods now, Stanley.
[97:38.07]Okay, I'm going to get us out of here.
[97:40.31]Let's find another game.
[97:41.35]Another game.
[97:41.95]Alright, this is cool.
[97:44.09]Something with nice, big, insurmountable walls.
[97:47.60]What do you got?
[97:51.84]Okay, I think this will be just the thing.
[98:00.14]Rocket League?
[98:01.26]See, this is exactly what I had in mind.
[98:03.66]Just a nice big box for you to run around in.
[98:06.48]There isn't any possibility that you could get lost here.
[98:09.39]Now this is game design.
[98:12.15]Stanley, if you manage to get lost in this game, I will be phenomenally impressed.
[98:18.83]But where are the cars?
[98:21.59]Okay, so what exactly do we do here?
[98:23.85]Let's see.
[98:25.20]There are lots of cars here in the back, but obviously there's no racetrack.
[98:28.78]Okay, I'm seeing that there's a ball of some kind back here.
[98:31.50]Is this game sports ball?
[98:33.66]Stanley, I think it's sports ball.
[98:36.24]Oh, what fun.
[98:37.18]We should run the bases and do a touchdown together.
[98:40.86]Yes, I think surely we must.
[98:43.30]Okay, Stanley, here's the ball.
[98:44.92]Have fun.
[98:48.52]Will this kill me if I go near it?
[98:53.46]By the way, I picked the blue door.
[98:55.40]I'm shooting it into the blue goal and he's probably going to be like pissed.
[99:01.59]Are you doing it?
[99:02.59]Are you winning?
[99:03.25]Is this fun?
[99:04.49]Is it better than my miserable little story that I worked so hard on?
[99:08.43]Stanley, I have a thought.
[99:09.61]Actually, I never got into Rocket League.
[99:10.73]I'm not a sportsologist, but if one ball generates a certain amount of raw adrenal pleasure, then surely multiple balls... Hold on.
[99:19.84]What are you doing?
[99:26.88]Stanley, don't do that.
[99:27.70]I can't follow you there.
[99:28.68]I can't help you.
[99:30.16]How will you write a story without me?
[99:31.91]You can't do it.
[99:32.69]You know that.
[99:33.29]Stanley, come back.
[99:36.39]Shit.
[99:36.75]Okay, so now what?
[99:37.69]Filing cabinet.
[99:40.31]Why did I say it like that?
[99:42.80]It's too dark.
[99:43.44]I can't see anything.
[99:45.04]Please rate your experience.
[99:47.62]Oh my goodness.
[100:00.63]Is this a horror game now or something?
[100:01.69]This is a horror game, isn't it?
[100:06.70]He turned it into a horror game.
[100:22.89]Is that what happened?
[100:32.45]What's that?
[100:42.13]4, 2, 7.
[100:42.32]What the fuck?
[101:15.15]I can't do anything.
[101:21.74]I wonder what he found.
[101:23.88]If what he wanted was to be the leading man in his own story, well, perhaps he's gotten it.
[101:28.52]Down in wherever he is right now.
[101:31.46]I wonder if he's happy with his choice.
[101:33.80]And if he's learned the heavy cost that comes with it.
[101:37.15]He'll understand soon what I was trying to tell him.
[101:40.05]He needs me.
[101:41.58]someone who will wrap everything up at the end to make sense out of the chaos and the fear and the confusion that's who I am that is what I mean to this world oh yes yes I'll be back there's no other way once this ends after it all comes to a close then I'll be back the end will be here soon very soon I can wait used car salesman here

[104:07.93]It was a fake tuber reaction.
[104:10.97]Okay, so far it's an elevator.
[104:13.47]Nothing special yet, but I'm sure it's just the beginning of a mesmerizing adventure.
[104:18.54]Okay.
[104:23.88]Um, is it broken?

[105:35.74]Surely that's not all the new content.
[105:37.98]There has to be something else, right?
[105:41.91]Another elevator.
[105:43.15]Stanley, I have to say, initial impressions of this game are not positive.
[105:48.35]It's just elevators and jumping.
[105:51.01]Is this what passes for exciting new content?
[105:53.92]If this is new content, then I could just read you the whole dictionary.
[105:57.16]There's 20 hours of new content right there.
[105:59.54]There's more than that.
[106:00.24]There's way more than... There's way more than that.
[106:02.62]Is there a melee now?
[106:03.42]Where's the jump?
[106:04.49]I don't have a jump.
[106:25.68]That was pretty good.
[106:43.22]That was good.
[106:43.72]I'm looking right now at the game's achievements and it's hard to believe one of them actually says test achievement, please ignore.
[106:51.04]What quality assurance department signed off on this?
[106:53.90]I'm infuriated and I'm offended and I intend to find these people on Twitter and hold them personally accountable.
[107:01.47]It's my fault, Stanley.
[107:02.89]I built up too much anticipation around the new content, I'm afraid.
[107:06.45]It could never have lived up to such expectations.
[107:09.23]That's true.
[107:09.65]If you're still with me.
[107:10.93]Why don't we just reset the game?
[107:13.07]And we'll try to get back to what The Stanley Parable is really about.
[107:17.34]No frills.
[107:18.64]No gimmicks.
[107:20.06]Just you and me having a great time together.
[107:22.24]Wait, so that's it?
[107:23.20]Do I have to do something else?
[107:24.18]What do you say, friend?
[107:32.96]Wait.
[107:33.98]This is different.
[107:35.48]Wait, what happened?
[107:37.87]This is different.
[107:39.71]This is different.
[107:44.63]Door 430.
[107:47.83]Psst.
[107:49.19]Stanley, come over here.
[107:52.21]In the vent.
[107:53.71]I want to show you something.
[107:55.51]Oh, not yet.
[107:59.71]Fees?
[108:00.25]No.
[108:00.85]Cigarette butts?
[108:01.49]Holy shit.
[108:03.43]Oh.
[108:04.29]You don't want to see the cool surprise I made for you?
[108:06.64]Well, fine.
[108:07.64]You're a dork anyways.
[108:11.60]You're a dork.
[108:16.14]okay new content it's closed when Stanley came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left
[108:44.75]Okay.
[108:45.25]No, I'm going down here.
[108:46.63]Oh, wait!
[108:47.07]I'm gonna dream!
[108:47.75]Okay, begin the game.
[109:15.20]OK.
[109:19.03]Stanley, come over here in the vent.
[109:24.62]I want to show you something.
[109:35.45]Okay, you remember how cheap and unsatisfying the new Ultra Deluxe content turned out to be?
[109:40.53]Yeah.
[109:40.81]What got me thinking about the past and how much better The Stanley Parable used to be.
[109:45.38]So I made something special and tucked it away here where the game's developers won't find it.
[109:51.70]Just our little secret.
[109:53.74]What is this?
[109:54.22]Is this the Warcraft Portal?
[109:56.65]What's that thing called?
[109:57.35]What's the Warcraft Portal?
[109:59.27]I've ruined it.
[109:59.87]Whatever.
[110:07.02]I call it the memory zone.
[110:09.92]It's where I've been storing all my favorite memories so I can relive the peak experiences of my life whenever I want.
[110:17.83]A memory zone.
[110:18.53]Experiences like the launch of The Stanley Parable on PC.
[110:24.05]The memory zone.
[110:25.01]Okay, so what can I do in here?
[110:26.13]Did I really not answer the telephone?
[110:30.32]I, whatever.
[110:33.44]Don't forget.
[110:33.86]You see, Stanley, doesn't the memory zone remind you of how wonderful Stanley Parable was before it was sullied with a cheap re-release?
[110:41.37]Award-winning.
[110:59.43]2013.
[110:59.45]2013.
[110:59.71]Our first kiss.
[111:01.79]My first car.
[111:02.53]The release of Stanley Parable.
[111:07.63]2013 was a pretty dogshit year for video games, wasn't it?
[111:13.58]What even came out in 2013?
[111:14.22]GTA 5 did.
[111:29.94]That's it.
[111:30.72]What else came out in 2013?
[111:32.52]Assassin's Creed.
[111:33.44]Mario Kart 8.
[111:36.64]Stanley Parable.
[111:40.38]The Last of Us.
[111:41.48]Metal Gear Rising.
[111:42.28]Metal Gear Rising.
[111:46.12]BioShock Infinite.
[111:58.13]British Academy Award.
[112:00.61]British Academy Award.
[112:01.63]A lot of Academy Awards.
[112:06.77]Risk of Rain.
[112:08.03]Old 2013 Jerma.
[112:09.59]We'll never get the magic back.
[112:17.67]No, we'll never get the magic.
[112:19.21]We'll never get the magic of... Never mind.
[112:23.95]Never mind.
[112:29.94]No- No-
[112:37.02]And over here is where I keep reviews of The Stanley Parable.
[112:40.64]Like this stunning triumph of games journalism.
[112:43.26]10 out of 10 from destructoid.com.
[112:46.73]Did it really get a 10?
[112:47.53]Did it actually get a 10 out of 10?
[112:50.39]Where so many games that aspire to be more than games end up less than any form of art, Stanley Parable strives and then succeeds to be every game ever created.
[113:01.48]Did you hear that, Stanley?
[113:03.04]Every game ever created.
[113:05.06]That's how grand and all-encompassing the original Stanley mod DB 2012 every game best ever packs.
[113:13.28]It was Skyrim.
[113:14.32]It was persona 3 It was all of them and now it's nothing.
[113:19.20]It's no games at all It isn't even The Stanley Parable anymore.
[113:23.49]It's just a husk now narrative excellent husk with an hour of wait a minute elevator content
[113:36.81]Persona 3?
[113:37.77]I didn't play... I haven't played any of the Personas.
[113:48.21]Nostalgic.
[113:48.87]It was good.
[113:49.53]Well, I feel like in like 10 years, I'm gonna be gripping one of the... two of those.
[113:58.70]Not 10 years.
[113:59.38]Holy shit, dude.
[114:00.58]Whoa.
[114:02.05]I was talking about being, like, buried, like, in a coffin with those.
[114:06.15]And, like, I'm thinking back to, like, I remember when I won those, I said, oh, in 10 years.
[114:09.44]No, can I, can this be a lot longer?
[114:12.22]Like, 60, 70 more years?
[114:17.32]I'm gonna be gripping those things, and I'm, like, fucking 90 in the coffin, just like...
[114:37.57]The end is never the end.
[114:40.20]Here's another moving passage, this time from GameSpot.com.
[114:43.94]What?
[114:44.46]The Stanley Parable is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of choice in games, and one that offers some of the most enjoyable, surprising, and rewarding choices I've ever been confronted with in a game.
[114:57.57]Nine out of ten.
[114:58.55]Don't you get it, Stanley?
[114:59.97]The game was perfect.
[115:01.91]It didn't need anything else.
[115:03.43]It didn't need new content.
[115:05.91]It just needed to be left alone to spend the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed hall of beloved video game memories.
[115:17.70]That's kind of sad.
[115:21.82]The serious room.
[115:22.94]Okay, I can't go in the serious room.
[115:30.81]How do I... I can't... Where's my jump?
[115:34.76]I can't jump.
[115:35.26]Where's my... I don't have a jump.
[115:42.45]And we're there.
[115:44.21]Stanley picked the door on the right.
[115:46.67]That would be crazy.
[116:06.56]Mario 64 Andy.
[116:07.25]It's a joke.
[116:26.22]Oh no.
[116:26.74]Oh God, no.
[116:28.24]Stanley, it's a collection of reviews from Steam, the online video game distributor.
[116:33.54]I haven't looked at these in years.
[116:35.56]I can't even imagine what's being collecting down here.
[116:38.14]Steam reviews.
[116:38.90]Surely these reviews were glowing as well, weren't they?
[116:42.88]Oh God.
[116:43.34]Uh oh.
[116:47.39]Honestly, I could not be bothered to play this game to full completion.
[116:50.97]The narrator is obnoxious and unfunny, with his humor and dialogue proving to be more irritating than entertaining.
[116:58.89]Unfunny!
[117:00.79]I'm not trying to be funny.
[117:02.53]I'm trying to make a serious work of art.
[117:04.60]I suppose I could write up a handful of gags to insert into The Stanley Parable, but the game is already such a densely layered web of profound philosophical insights that I can't even imagine where I'd have the room to stick them.
[117:21.41]Unfunny.
[117:22.63]Okay.
[117:36.90]Does this do anything?
[117:37.60]Nope.
[117:37.80]Can I climb this?
[117:39.40]Nope.
[117:44.28]There's a spider on your shelf.
[117:47.33]He's probably eating the bad bugs.
[117:55.27]Can you guys imagine if this was just one day?
[117:59.19]All of a sudden, there was just a huge tarantula just like here, like climbing over here and shit.
[118:04.98]And I was like, what are you talking about, guys?
[118:06.50]Fucking stop.
[118:08.38]Like, shut up.
[118:11.58]Like a fucking 90s comedy movie.
[118:14.98]While the idea for the game is good, for someone who prefers non-linear games, this preachiness gets annoying fast.
[118:22.10]Preachy?
[118:23.18]Stanley, I'm not preachy, am I?
[118:26.01]You can tell me if I'm preachy.
[118:27.41]Honestly, you can.
[118:28.23]Oh, goodness.
[118:29.63]This is actually quite shocking for me.
[118:32.09]I always... Well, to be honest, I had always thought of the game's dialogue as being rather terse to begin with.
[118:38.31]You can't know how much fluff I cut from the game to get it to feel as light and airy as it... Well, I always thought it did.
[118:44.96]But maybe it wasn't.
[118:46.02]Three hours on record.
[118:47.10]That's a lot.
[118:48.00]You pretty much saw everything.
[118:48.90]What a poor memory to have to hold on to.
[118:51.06]These black marks are my otherwise unimpeachable track record.
[118:55.78]I feel like a failure.
[118:58.62]Like I let these people down.
[119:00.73]Perhaps The Stanley Parable isn't quite as sterling as I always remembered.
[119:07.62]It's like the one person that's like, hey, dude, dollhouse sucked.
[119:11.06]It wasn't funny.
[119:12.10]I'm just like.
[119:23.19]And I'm like, I got to take a few.
[119:31.58]I got to take a week off streaming.
[119:36.23]what's this one got to say you constantly have to stop doing anything so the narrator can catch up with his explanations of what's happening I wish there was a skip button
[119:50.24]A skip button?
[119:51.10]A stick of ten hours?
[119:52.40]Well, yes.
[119:53.52]Yes, I think we can do that.
[119:54.88]If I'm truly too preachy, then... How do you play the original Stanley Parable for ten hours?
[120:00.32]Not if it means we can strike these negative reviews from the record.
[120:05.13]Only positive reviews of The Stanley Parable.
[120:07.89]That's my motto today, and it's always been my motto.
[120:10.99]I'd do anything for the customer, Stanley.
[120:13.27]Yes, a skip button we shall have.
[120:20.52]This reminds me of Resident Evil 4.
[120:22.85]Like, this exact thing I'm looking at right now.
[120:26.11]This exact screenshot.
[120:27.47]Exact.
[120:28.79]Resident Evil 4.
[120:29.51]Right here.
[120:30.35]Right there.
[120:30.61]I'm not present.
[120:45.51]How long has it been?
[120:56.42]Okay.
[120:56.56]Can you edit a review?
[120:57.38]Okay.
[121:23.88]Okay, welcome back Stanley.
[121:25.16]Now I should say that the amount of time the button has been skipping through is becoming longer and longer.
[121:30.36]That last one was, well, I want to say maybe 30, 45 minutes?
[121:36.15]Stanley, Stanley, please don't push the button again.
[121:40.24]It's been 12 hours.
[121:42.68]You've just been frozen there.
[121:44.12]I know why the skips are getting longer, but they're really, truly getting longer.
[121:48.49]And my God, there's no way out of the room.
[121:51.09]Stanley, the door is gone.
[121:52.57]It's completely gone.
[121:54.44]I've looked at it from every angle.
[121:55.96]I've checked every one of those walls a thousand times.
[121:59.52]There's no door, Stanley.
[122:01.59]There's no door.
[122:02.75]There's just you and the button.
[122:04.99]And if you keep pressing it, I have no idea what will happen.
[122:08.41]I have no idea how long I'll be made to sit here.
[122:11.51]And more than anything else, I don't know how to stop you from pressing the button again.
[122:16.10]Create a door.
[122:16.70]I can't control anything in this room, Stanley.
[122:18.94]I can't touch it.
[122:19.88]Sorry, if the Muppets could do it, you could too.
[122:21.58]I have to know that sooner or later, no matter how much I plead with you, you're going to press the button again.
[122:27.68]Why would you?
[122:29.02]I've been thinking and thinking, and I don't know what I can do to convince you otherwise.
[122:33.12]Oh my God.
[122:34.90]And it's all because of those reviews.
[122:37.05]Those reviews that I couldn't get out of my head.
[122:39.01]I just couldn't ignore the negative feedback.
[122:42.07]Why was it so important for me to fix the problem?
[122:45.42]Why did Cookie9's opinion matter so much to me?
[122:48.12]I've never even met Cookie9.
[122:50.42]Stanley shit back.
[122:53.56]Oh my goodness.
[122:54.68]I have someone to talk to again I think it's been a week or two weeks I've been sitting here all that time just sitting here notice you to water the plan And you'd think that that's just how it's always been right me talking and you saying nothing
[123:14.35]would you think that it's exactly the same as always their door doesn't that feel like what we've already been doing me just talking but it isn't Stanley it isn't the same at all it isn't even close because I know you can't hear me once you push that button that's what I'm realizing now Stanley I'm realizing that I needed to know that someone was listening
[123:37.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[124:07.40]Gotta keep me interested.
[124:10.90]Keep me interested.
[124:11.52]Play a sound effect or something.
[124:24.86]I can't be taken by it, Stanley.
[124:26.79]I can't lose myself in a stretch of emptiness.
[124:29.15]Oh, I'm going to press it.
[124:30.13]I'm going to press it.
[124:30.87]When you press that button, you're still right there.
[124:33.57]But I know you're so tremendously far away.
[124:36.91]And in those moments, the emptiness folds itself outward in between the two of us.
[124:41.36]Alright, I'll give you another minute.
[124:42.32]I am suspended in its unyielding quiet.
[124:45.18]I know, it's like a podcast.
[124:46.38]I feel the edges of my reality curdling inward and decaying.
[124:51.40]I can tell that I am becoming less and less real yet to speak to you now I am alive I am truly and completely here I am a being I am someone I am something I am being listened to I am being recognized the emptiness between us has collapsed and I feel right now like I am not a work of fiction I feel oh
[125:18.46]Hello.
[125:19.21]It's you.
[125:19.97]You're here again.
[125:20.78]Welcome.
[125:21.88]I have had time to think about you and about us and about everything we've been through.
[125:26.80]I've had so much time.
[125:28.42]How much time?
[125:29.09]I stopped keeping track after a year.
[125:31.09]It's been a year?
[125:31.57]Have you ever sat down in one place and not moved for one entire year?
[125:35.01]Oh, no.
[125:35.27]Let me describe it for you.
[125:37.27]To begin with, there is only regret.
[125:40.01]There is only the turning wheel of missed opportunities.
[125:43.17]I felt nothing at all but regret for the longest time, Stanley.
[125:46.41]Is there a door?
[125:47.61]Door.
[125:47.71]Days.
[125:48.58]Months.
[125:49.42]I lost it all in a blur of the deepest longing to undo the past.
[125:54.28]And when that feeling had begun to subside... Where is he?
[126:14.70]Did he leave?
[126:15.58]Where did he go?
[126:16.74]Where is he?
[126:21.82]Where is he?
[126:25.22]How long has it been?
[126:29.90]Where is he?
[126:30.26]What do you mean he's dead?
[126:33.25]He's a computer program.
[126:34.51]He can't die?
[126:39.93]What the fuck?
[126:40.83]Alright.
[126:41.23]Alright.
[126:41.55]Alright.
[126:41.89]Alright.
[126:42.23]Alright.
[126:42.67]Okay.
[126:43.19]Okay.
[126:43.55]Alright.
[126:43.92]Alright.
[126:44.24]Turn it off.
[126:44.70]Turn it off.
[126:45.64]Turn it off.
[126:46.74]Turn it off.
[126:48.06]Turn it off.
[126:48.68]Where is it?
[126:49.12]Turn it off.
[126:49.52]I don't want to hear this.
[126:50.12]Turn it off.
[126:51.67]But they didn't understand the game was never meant to be funny.
[126:54.93]It was meant to have a point.
[126:56.21]It was meant to speak to the human condition.
[126:58.41]But where are the jokes?
[126:59.49]Where are the jokes?
[127:00.33]They bemoaned.
[127:00.85]They screamed.
[127:01.75]They gnashed their teeth and said, entertain us.
[127:05.09]It wasn't enough.
[127:06.02]They had to leave a pathetic little thumbs down review and make all of their pitiful demands.
[127:11.26]But then, he's talking too much.
[127:13.12]They said, he didn't entertain us.
[127:15.24]Now he went, shut up.
[127:16.42]It's the inconsistency.
[127:17.72]It's the lack of accountability.
[127:19.12]I ain't skipping!
[127:36.20]and are accountable to nothing.
[127:37.58]I'm not skipping at all.
[127:38.58]No skipping.
[127:39.84]There should be a skip button.
[127:41.28]You should be able to freeze Stanley in place while the narrator sits there forever and ever.
[127:45.88]We want all of this in the new Stanley Parable.
[127:48.23]We demand it.
[127:49.57]And then, because it was said, because it was spoken, now it simply has to happen.
[127:55.63]the most immediate desires.
[127:57.45]Every single thing demanded by every person at every moment in time.
[128:02.34]If someone wants it, then it's a crime not to bring it into being.
[128:05.56]Have we been given to indulging every fleeting whim for no reason other than to do so?
[128:11.62]Yes!
[128:12.74]Yes, it seems that this is now the world we live in.
[128:15.98]It seems that we are... Play Glover.
[128:18.28]Play Glover.
[128:19.64]Fart.
[128:21.12]Fart in your chair.
[128:23.24]Hey, make a sound.
[128:24.50]Funny sound.
[128:26.12]Fart in the sound.
[128:27.30]Hey.
[128:30.13]Oh, f*** you, right?
[128:31.33]Hey, look at me.
[128:35.29]Look at this.
[128:36.37]...inside ourselves.
[128:37.69]We would turn...
[128:53.81]I just don't want to hear that sound anymore.
[128:57.28]Gross.
[128:57.86]Minus 10.
[129:02.46]You lost to the skip button.
[129:07.40]Every time you press the skip button, you lose a thousand viewers.
[129:15.10]Nah, that's not happening, is it?
[129:16.76]Nah, is that happening?
[129:19.14]Nah, that's not.
[129:19.92]Is that happening?
[129:22.51]Well, isn't he crafting the game?
[129:57.49]Why would he just craft a, like, a tuna sandwich or something for me to hang out and eat?
[130:03.33]Why am I, like, demanding a sandwich?
[130:05.37]What am I talking about?
[130:08.74]That's, like, not cool.
[130:12.34]How long has it been?
[130:13.06]I've been here for, like, a thousand years or something?
[130:15.22]What's going on?
[130:21.69]Can I get out?
[130:40.17]Like, life is growing in here now.
[130:49.49]Dude, what would be awesome is if, like, you heard, and, like, a T-Rex's face looked in, and we weren't going forward.
[130:59.06]We were going backwards.
[131:07.32]What the fuck?
[131:11.17]That idea is dumb as hell.
[131:15.50]That's stupid.
[131:17.42]Fuck you.
[131:22.32]Fuck you.
[131:22.76]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[131:38.03]It's scary now.
[131:43.00]Hey, why is it so scary?
[131:53.79]What the fuck?
[131:56.99]I can get out!
[132:22.78]Doesn't work What the fuck?
[132:54.84]How long was I sitting there?
[132:56.57]Stanley wondered to himself.
[132:58.27]Minutes?
[132:59.15]Days?
[133:00.19]Centuries?
[133:01.29]Did something crucial happen while my senses were turned?
[133:04.95]He made a note to be more careful with time from now on.
[133:08.15]Be more careful with time.
[133:09.37]Write that down.
[133:11.43]New new content, not old new content.
[133:14.98]Okay.
[133:15.68]Oh, good.
[133:16.40]You notice my sign.
[133:17.90]Yes, I have something very exciting to show you.
[133:26.27]What about that door?
[133:36.01]I could probably go this way too, right?
[133:37.27]Eventually, maybe?
[133:37.77]I don't know.
[133:41.35]new you see Stanley I've been reflecting on The Stanley Parable and about how roundly disappointing this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be I think it's alright Stanley Parable was a landmark and any new content for it should live up to that legacy I think it's close so far get this ultra deluxe nonsense I say we take it one step even further
[134:05.36]Which is why I'm very proud to announce for the first time ever The Stanley Parable 2.
[134:12.03]Ooh.
[134:52.43]Ooh!
[134:52.79]Stanley Parable 2!
[134:57.95]Investor Showcase!
[135:34.92]Okay.
[135:35.72]The end is never the end again.
[135:38.04]Stanley Parable 2.
[135:38.98]Yeah.
[135:39.26]Yeah.
[136:04.19]Yeah, I agree.
[136:08.13]But Stanley Parable, colon, let's get it.
[136:10.31]I think it would have dragged in more people.
[136:28.76]Stanley Parable, colon, fuck you.
[136:32.60]People would be like, what is that?
[136:38.78]They're back.
[136:39.45]Two doors.
[136:45.07]Win-win.
[136:45.71]Sequential mid-share.
[136:47.63]Color red.
[136:48.44]Leverage.
[136:49.64]Paradigm shift.
[136:50.62]Synergy.
[137:03.06]Oh, this is the graphics.
[137:03.94]I would say I'm more of a fan of... I like the first... I think they went with the good one.
[137:17.52]Oh, the others are too.
[137:18.20]I don't know.
[137:18.72]I don't like them.
[137:19.50]I think they wanted the right idea.
[137:21.30]Number three?
[137:21.98]Number three?
[137:23.84]That looks like a soap opera.
[137:25.18]No.
[137:25.30]No.
[137:35.51]Case for sequel.
[137:36.13]Game development is much more of a fuzzy magic than anything scientific or logical, really.
[138:02.59]Number two, chat.
[138:03.57]I feel like I drew these.
[138:07.19]The end is never the end.
[138:08.31]Again.
[138:13.19]Two.
[138:15.15]Two.
[138:15.45]That looks like a movie poster.
[138:24.70]This way to the show floor.
[138:25.88]Alright, what about new features?
[138:26.92]What do we got?
[138:28.92]New features, new content.
[138:35.10]New features.
[138:43.90]Expo Hall 2.
[138:44.46]Whoa.
[138:45.54]Merch.
[139:02.24]Is this all fake?
[139:02.90]Because I would probably wear one of these.
[139:04.70]Is this fake?
[139:05.12]Are these real things?
[139:17.69]This t-shirt is the best new feature.
[139:20.13]And then have like the two on the back.
[139:22.15]I would wear one of these.
[139:24.13]What is that?
[139:27.59]Reassurance bucket?
[139:28.85]The button that says the name of the player that is playing the game.
[139:34.15]Hear your name in the game.
[139:35.73]The button that says the name of the player that's playing the game.
[139:38.55]That's new.
[139:39.11]Go back.
[139:41.69]What do I mean back?
[139:42.27]What?
[139:45.30]Merch.
[139:46.12]Oh, it's a QR code.
[139:47.64]So it is real.
[139:50.42]We want the QR code.
[139:51.30]Alright, well, get close enough.
[139:52.88]Look.
[139:53.64]What do I want to tell you?
[140:03.44]Don't do it.
[140:04.92]I'll do it later.
[140:07.22]I'll do it later.
[140:07.98]I don't want to do that right now.
[140:11.78]No screenshots.
[140:17.25]Why is it making the sound that happens when you're about to get a phone call?
[140:28.81]You guys know that sound?
[140:29.89]That's fucking weird, man.
[140:32.95]This is the sound that happens through speakers when your phone is about to ring.
[140:40.01]That's so weird.
[140:41.07]That's actually weird.
[140:47.03]The jump circle?
[140:51.29]How do they get that sound?
[140:52.47]How do they even know what that is?
[140:53.55]Enjoy the new features.
[140:55.56]Okay, name.
[140:58.54]For The Stanley Parable 2, I asked myself...
[141:02.22]What do players really want?
[141:04.34]And of course, the first and most obvious answer is that they want to be individually recognized and validated as people.
[141:12.74]So with that in mind, my first addition to the game is this button which speaks the name of the person playing the game.
[141:20.52]Isn't that wonderful?
[141:28.25]Try it here.
[141:31.86]Is this going to say my Steam name?
[141:33.86]Because my Steam name right now is fucking Gas Can.
[141:45.10]Is it Gas Can right now?
[141:55.13]Sorry, I should have clarified.
[141:57.21]Right now, the button only says the name Jim.
[142:00.33]But of course, in the final game, this button will say your name, whatever name that is.
[142:05.39]Here, let's have you roleplay as Jim.
[142:07.63]I don't want to roleplay as Jim.
[142:09.25]Experience of this feature.
[142:10.95]Just play along.
[142:11.97]I promise you'll love it.
[142:13.79]Okay, here we go.
[142:14.91]Let's take a deep breath, clear your mind, forget whoever you are, and simply become a person named Jim.
[142:21.64]I want you to imagine yourself living as Jim, sleeping and waking as Jim, falling in love and being heartbroken as Jim, seizing all of the world's possibilities as Jim, and as Jim watching your dreams crumble into dust.
[142:37.84]Do you feel it deeply?
[142:39.01]I mean, are you really, truly Jim right now?
[142:41.59]I mean, Jim, Jeremy, Jim, Jeremy, I mean.
[142:48.53]Jim.
[142:50.90]Yes, you see.
[142:52.52]What a thrill.
[142:53.28]What a rush.
[142:53.94]That was you.
[142:54.56]The button described you.
[142:56.60]Do it again.
[142:57.04]Do it again.
[142:59.48]it hits even harder the second time if this were the only new feature in The Stanley Parable 2 it would still be worth the money let's take a break from the gym button I'm too emotionally drained from all of this personal validation oh there cowboy sometimes a person can be too much Jim I'm putting the gym button away otherwise soon you'll start to lose all sense of who you actually are that's really loud
[143:37.33]Cool, alright.
[143:39.75]It clipped through the floor, yeah.
[143:43.59]What other new features are in this new game?
[143:49.57]I actually kind of like that big button, because I really feel like it's going to be squishy.
[143:53.37]And I can punch it, and it'll resist me, but it'll be squishy, so it'll be like... You know what I mean?
[143:59.51]It'll be kind of full of... I can punch that button.
[144:04.23]That one is way too small, but eh...
[144:09.10]That one's kind of cool, though, because it's like a pen cap, right?
[144:13.24]Those are fun to do.
[144:15.76]I would think this one's the wrong one.
[144:17.57]Yeah, that's like just basic.
[144:21.91]I can't punch that one, and I can't click that one.
[144:29.57]Frankly, it's a waste of goddamn time.
[144:30.91]Okay.
[144:35.98]Okay.
[144:37.27]I suppose I could allow only people named Jim to play The Stanley Parable too.
[144:41.39]That would actually save me the work of finishing this feature.
[144:46.02]So what else is there?
[144:47.02]There's this like weird guy over there.
[144:49.00]Hold on.
[144:53.50]Epilogue.
[144:53.98]I'm not ready for this.
[144:55.72]An epilogue would be fun, wouldn't it, Stanley?
[144:58.20]Yes, yes.
[144:59.14]It would go at the end of the... Well, we'll figure that out later.
[145:06.85]Those are the weird metaverse guy.
[145:08.44]Alright, I need to know what that is.
[145:19.78]Free achievement.
[145:23.93]Free new plus easy achievement.
[145:25.45]It can't be that simple.
[145:27.27]Oh, the jump circle.
[145:28.81]You know what, Stanley?
[145:29.85]I actually think the jump circle was a pretty good idea.
[145:32.71]I'd like to hang on to that for the sequel.
[145:37.57]What?
[145:37.75]I don't have any more jumps?
[145:53.44]This map free achievement.
[145:54.32]The button that says the name.
[145:55.28]Merge settings world champion.
[145:57.85]Stanley Parable reassurance bucket.
[146:00.85]Infinite hole.
[146:01.89]Alright.
[146:02.39]Well, I need to see this first.
[146:11.37]Well, there's an exit.
[146:12.10]Alright.
[146:12.32]Exit's over there, but what is this?
[146:20.06]Can you find them?
[146:20.84]Can you find them?
[146:21.50]Can you find them?
[146:22.74]Collect them all.
[146:27.44]Remember, you're on the website.
[146:30.32]What?
[146:30.60]You're on the QR code?
[146:31.80]Let me check the code.
[146:56.20]Please go to the website.
[146:57.54]What do you mean, go to the website?
[147:07.79]Stanley Parable 2?
[147:11.21]What?
[147:15.91]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[147:23.40]Expo visitor live feed.
[147:25.18]Right now a man named called Jerma is exploring the exhibit.
[147:27.66]He's reading this right now.
[147:33.11]What?
[147:37.61]What the hell are you talking about?
[147:50.57]Because I pressed the button?
[147:51.75]I thought you guys were fucking with me.
[147:53.91]This is... This is weird.
[147:55.90]Hold on.
[148:11.23]This is very weird.
[148:21.46]This is what's on the fucking website right now.
[148:30.73]That's so strange.
[148:32.83]How would they know I was Jerma?
[148:36.95]That's what?
[148:43.81]How would they know that?
[148:50.27]That's so weird.
[148:55.38]My username?
[148:57.14]My username is Gascan.
[148:58.70]That's... Why do I gotta wake up?
[149:06.16]That's fucking crazy.
[149:10.04]That's funny.
[149:12.50]That's cool though.
[149:13.24]Alright, let's keep going.
[149:15.78]That's so weird.
[149:20.63]They manually did it?
[149:22.43]Wow, that's cool.
[149:24.01]Hi.
[149:28.66]Alright, let's go.
[149:43.56]Is it gonna be a brain?
[149:52.07]It's updating.
[149:52.85]What do you mean it's updating?
[150:00.57]What is going on?
[150:02.27]What?
[150:03.19]What?
[150:10.84]It's taking this random thumbnails.
[150:19.42]Hold on.
[150:21.20]Hold on.
[150:44.39]I just heard Oli.
[150:46.01]Oli!
[150:46.41]Oli!
[150:47.17]I just heard Oli say ew in the other room.
[150:50.27]I just heard it.
[150:51.31]I fucking heard it.
[150:52.83]I heard Oli say ew.
[150:54.97]I heard ew.
[150:55.49]Oh, I touched my tooth.
[151:17.07]Is it updated?
[151:26.32]No?
[151:34.06]Is it updated?
[151:36.59]Got it.
[151:40.37]Let's go to the stanleyparable2.com.
[151:41.81]Okay.
[151:52.87]Oh, no, but I'm looking.
[151:54.33]I'm looking over there.
[151:56.31]Shit.
[151:56.81]No, I'm looking.
[151:57.80]Hold on.
[151:58.66]I'm looking.
[151:59.38]I can't be looking.
[152:01.52]I can't be looking.
[152:02.04]I gotta be looking down.
[152:03.24]I gotta get it again.
[152:06.41]Or how about this, like...
[152:55.14]Is it there?
[153:29.71]Is it there?
[153:30.05]Alright.
[153:37.05]Wait, what?
[153:47.84]That's a fucking tarantula.
[153:57.75]That's so stupid.
[154:09.62]Alright, now put the tarantula in my mouth.
[154:12.19]Put the tarantula in my mouth.
[154:13.87]I'm gonna be, like, shocked that it's in there.
[154:15.69]You know what I mean?
[154:16.25]Like... Like...
[155:03.67]Is there?
[155:05.55]Is there?
[155:10.67]It's not a soy face.
[155:27.83]It's a fucking spider in my mouth-face.
[155:29.93]Is there?
[155:43.98]he's the dev the dev is even sick of this joke the dev is like alright this is kind of funny but like fucking hurry up okay alright well that's funny that's funny
[156:15.58]Alright, let's go.
[156:16.02]There's people saying, dude, don't, like, open your mouth and, like, go, like, oh, whoa, whatever.
[156:23.90]Oh, my, oh, no, whatever.
[156:25.50]Oh, whatever.
[156:29.74]You're torturing the devs.
[156:38.17]That's kind of funny that they do that.
[156:39.31]Alright, let's go.
[156:45.27]I didn't even see what was down here.
[156:46.11]This is weird.
[157:04.08]Um, um, hold on.
[157:08.31]One second.
[157:09.51]I'm realizing something happened that I'm not happy about.
[157:12.39]But I'm gonna, whatever.
[157:19.73]I'm not happy about this.
[157:31.69]But it's funny to show.
[157:47.56]Great.
[158:03.06]Nice clickbait.
[158:10.85]What do you mean, update?
[158:16.65]That's a different person.
[158:17.65]They're cycling through like streamers, man.
[158:20.66]That's a different person.
[158:22.42]They're just cycling.
[158:23.58]Look, we gotta move on from this.
[158:25.20]Because right now, I believe this is Jacksepticeye now.
[158:29.20]I believe that...
[158:31.66]Jack!
[158:32.52]It's a good game!
[158:33.17]I fucking love that.
[158:41.95]That's so fucking funny.
[158:47.65]Wait, I can collect these?
[158:58.40]Jacksepticeye is not even live!
[159:06.52]Is he?
[159:11.38]God, it really is the worst when you collect everything in a video game, and then they give you a big fancy reward for it.
[159:17.86]Absolutely tragic.
[159:20.69]Wait, what does it say?
[159:22.63]A man called Sean?
[159:37.87]Alright, let's keep going.
[159:46.44]Wait, that's his... his name's... His name's not Jack?
[160:12.63]It's whatever, it's alright.
[160:15.83]Jim.
[160:16.65]Well, your name's Jim.
[160:18.08]Oh.
[160:22.31]Alright, let's go.
[160:23.09]Let's go to the bucket.
[160:32.84]A common complaint of The Stanley Parable was that it was confusing and paradoxical, that it engendered a chaotic sense of recklessness for those who played it.
[160:42.61]Well, I'm happy to say that after much consideration, I've engineered a clever solution to this fundamental problem with the game.
[160:51.64]it's The Stanley Parable reassurance bucket you see Stanley anytime you're holding the bucket a sense of calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart it's true as long as you hold on to the bucket the many disorienting contradictions of The Stanley Parable will feel perfectly normal and perhaps even comforting
[161:14.06]you may even come to long for the gentle embrace of jarring cognitive dissonance while the bucket is in your arms and to be honest it's a much more convenient solution for me than actually redesigning the game to be less uncomfortable could you imagine what a pain in the ass that would be yes the bucket is the perfect solution come on give it a try did I like mess up my white balance on my camera or something
[161:44.28]Can you feel it?
[161:45.98]The glow of comfort, even in the face of crushing despair, must already be sweeping through your body.
[161:52.42]And in fact, can I say that I do believe the bucket lends you an air of charisma as well?
[161:58.19]I think that just holding it has made you the slightest bit more attractive as a person.
[162:03.93]The benefits of the bucket seem to go on and on, don't they?
[162:07.43]All this and more awaits you in The Stanley Parable 2.
[162:15.57]It's a puke bucket.
[162:21.19]Can I be gross for a second?
[162:21.97]Let's see.
[162:36.12]Does anyone give out awards for most enjoyable bucket in a video game?
[162:40.98]That really should be an award if it isn't already.
[162:55.54]I'm smiling with no teeth!
[162:58.14]Alright, um... So, how do I put this down?
[163:01.12]What about the infinite hole?
[163:11.57]I can't put this down?
[163:15.53]What about the infinite hole?
[163:21.98]Get yours right now.
[163:22.68]Pull the lever, receive your new achievement.
[163:24.64]No more steps.
[163:25.58]It just works.
[163:26.64]Get yours right now.
[163:29.80]Now, here's something special.
[163:31.38]You remember that broken test achievement that got left in the game on accident?
[163:35.28]Yeah, what the fuck's up with that?
[163:37.28]To simply give you the achievement.
[163:39.65]Yes.
[163:40.27]You see, you all come to this lever, and when you pull it, the achievement will be given to you.
[163:44.99]It's as simple as that.
[163:52.98]If this was real life, I'd piss in this bucket right now.
[163:54.63]I gotta pee right now.
[163:57.47]There's no bathroom here.
[164:03.92]Gamers.
[164:04.08]I can't get it?
[164:32.30]Come on.
[164:34.14]Really?
[164:34.52]Come on, Gwen.
[164:36.51]I can't get this.
[164:39.97]Bullshit.
[164:41.95]Alright, I'm gonna pee.
[164:42.45]I'll be right back.
[164:44.06]It'll be like two minutes.
[165:06.75]Thank you.
[166:07.72]you
[167:34.96]Thank you.
[168:20.15]And three, two.
[168:23.31]What's going on, guys?
[168:23.99]Welcome back.
[168:26.01]I am going to be hopping back into The Stanley Parable 2.
[168:31.68]All you gamers, thanks for joining me, as always.
[168:36.82]Let's get back to it, if we could.
[168:39.62]Let me adjust this, because this needs to be brighter.
[168:46.02]I have mad scientist hair right now, but that's alright.
[168:51.58]That worse or better?
[168:52.30]Hard to tell.
[169:15.99]What'd you just say?
[169:16.53]Dude, this stream is like not funny.
[169:28.06]Whatever, that's your opinion.
[169:33.25]I think it looks fine, whatever.
[169:34.35]Alright, so I had the bucket.
[169:53.99]Keep the horror.
[169:54.93]Get the achievement.
[169:55.67]How am I supposed to get the achievement?
[169:57.31]What do you mean, get the achievement?
[169:58.39]What the fuck?
[170:07.54]I can't get it.
[170:08.02]What do you mean you can?
[170:09.92]No, I can't.
[170:10.60]Stop!
[170:11.72]I'm gonna start fucking timing people up for a few days, you know what I'm saying?
[170:16.14]Alright, I can't get the achievement.
[170:17.18]It doesn't work.
[170:18.93]Please, go.
[170:19.63]That doesn't work.
[170:25.60]I probably have to do something special.
[170:26.94]I definitely have to do something special and come back here.
[170:34.28]Oh, the lever.
[170:36.56]I did it already.
[170:37.20]It's lying to me.
[170:42.34]How are you guys doing?
[170:47.62]You guys doing good?
[170:49.71]How are you?
[170:49.99]How are you doing today?
[170:51.67]Actually, how are you?
[170:52.89]What other exhibits haven't we seen yet?
[170:57.47]Um, what actually have I not done?
[170:58.55]I did the jump circle.
[171:03.66]I did this.
[171:04.18]I ate a minute.
[171:06.82]Oh.
[171:07.48]I like that one.
[171:09.66]Uh, free achievement.
[171:10.38]The button that says the name.
[171:11.78]Merch.
[171:12.94]Settings world champion.
[171:14.30]Where's that?
[171:16.71]Okay.
[171:17.07]Settings world champion is by the merch table.
[171:20.75]Let's do that.
[171:28.48]There's the Bucket Merch Settings World Championship.
[171:34.04]Where's that?
[171:36.12]Here?
[171:40.22]Is this it?
[171:42.70]Okay, I'll be honest.
[171:43.70]I haven't yet decided on this one.
[171:45.98]I think that in the new version, the office could use a bit of decoration, like balloons.
[171:52.11]Oh, balloons would be cool.
[171:53.21]Get well someday, and happy 12th birthday.
[171:57.01]Which would you go with?
[171:59.59]Happy 12th birthday.
[172:00.29]Okay.
[172:10.17]Get well someday.
[172:10.97]Happy 12th birthday.
[172:12.99]I think it's going to be 12th birthday.
[172:17.93]You know, sometimes when you solicit another person's opinion, it makes you realize that you knew which one you actually really wanted all along.
[172:26.08]Get well, someday it is.
[172:27.83]Hey, that's not fair.
[172:30.17]I said I wanted to get a happy, whatever.
[172:43.81]Is that it?
[172:47.61]No.
[172:48.97]No screenshots.
[172:49.91]What if I take a screenshot?
[172:51.55]What is screenshot on Steam?
[172:56.64]I might have remapped it.
[172:57.58]F12?
[172:59.84]No.
[173:00.94]What could I have possibly remapped it to?
[173:02.96]I don't know.
[173:12.77]Okay.
[173:13.73]Um, I didn't do the hole.
[173:14.77]Where's the hole?
[173:15.53]I didn't go down there.
[173:16.13]Okay, where's the hole?
[173:16.79]Okay, office decorations, epilogue, collectibles, infinite hole, K. Where's K?
[173:32.23]Alright, so I need to go... What's A9?
[173:36.21]Collectibles.
[173:37.67]So I gotta go from here, I gotta go straight and then left.
[173:41.14]So I get out of here and go left.
[173:46.45]This way, right?
[173:51.29]This way?
[173:54.59]That's the name button.
[173:55.55]Down here?
[173:56.85]Where was it?
[174:03.04]Over here?
[174:07.36]Oh, wait.
[174:07.64]Oh, there it is.
[174:09.54]Infinite hole.
[174:11.80]What?
[174:12.96]Oh, it's just in here.
[174:17.59]Wait.
[174:18.13]Oh.
[174:18.55]Oh.
[174:23.61]Wait.
[174:24.94]What?
[174:33.48]I don't get it.
[174:40.10]I was already here.
[174:43.73]Where's the infinite hole?
[174:44.69]I was already here.
[174:48.29]This way?
[174:48.65]He's actually trolling.
[174:54.05]I'm... Okay, this is it.
[174:58.96]I don't know.
[174:59.66]That was... Go that way.
[175:00.96]Infinite hold chart.
[175:04.86]Educational use only.
[175:06.70]It just keeps going.
[175:07.82]For real?
[175:09.83]For real?
[175:11.71]Stanley, here's an idea that I'm truly fond of.
[175:14.55]It's never been done before in a video game.
[175:16.99]This is, in fact, a hole that you can fall down forever.
[175:21.06]That's right.
[175:22.12]Infinite falling.
[175:23.72]You can fall until the end of time, if you like.
[175:26.86]A Stanley Ford for video games is a medium.
[175:32.04]OK.
[175:33.86]So if I jump in that, is it over?
[175:35.68]Do I have to start over?
[175:43.65]Can I throw the bucket?
[175:46.23]Let's go.
[175:52.75]You see, isn't it wonderful?
[175:54.88]One of my more ingenious concoctions, if I do say so.
[175:58.52]Now then, since you've gotten to see the infinite hole, you can press the teleport button to pop back up to the top and we can continue onward.
[176:10.40]What if I... Just stay in it?
[176:12.46]Is it actually infinite?
[176:13.02]Or am I gonna splat on the ground?
[176:28.13]Okay, Stanley, I don't know quite how to say this tactfully, but it's possible that I slightly exaggerated the infinite nature of the hole.
[176:36.19]Is it a very, very deep hole?
[176:38.17]To be certain it is.
[176:39.81]It's an extremely deep hole.
[176:41.99]I don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly deep hole.
[176:45.23]It is.
[176:46.01]Is it infinite?
[176:47.77]Well, that sort of depends on your definition of infinity.
[176:50.99]It's got bigger.
[176:51.53]From one perspective, the infinite is merely philosophical in nature.
[176:55.86]It's more of a...
[176:57.89]Okay, well, good for you.
[177:00.01]You found the bottom of the hole.
[177:01.61]How am I alive?
[177:02.11]You found me out, Stanley.
[177:03.88]I'm a liar and a cheat and you're so clever.
[177:06.72]Look, I think the issue here is just that you're unusually fascinated by falling.
[177:11.82]True.
[177:12.46]What normal person actually wants to fall infinitely?
[177:16.27]I figured the hole was as deep as anyone would actually need.
[177:19.35]Don't you put this on me.
[177:21.01]Maybe you're the problem.
[177:23.36]How do I get out of here?
[177:24.00]No.
[177:25.22]That's a lie.
[177:25.48]That's false advertising.
[177:26.30]False advertising.
[177:27.28]I'm not going anywhere until you fix it and make it actually infinite.
[177:58.89]I got all day.
[178:07.36]Great.
[178:07.90]Now I'm very excited for heaven.
[178:10.91]You see?
[178:12.03]I was right.
[178:13.25]The problem is you.
[178:14.09]The problem is that you like holes too much.
[178:17.93]Not normal.
[178:19.01]A normal person would have said, yep, that's an infinite hole right there.
[178:22.33]Goes on forever till the end of time.
[178:24.23]Don't need to see it all, but not you.
[178:26.13]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[178:27.63]You have a weird sort of...
[178:30.63]yay did the hole seem even shorter to you this time I couldn't help but feel like you spent a little less time in there than you did before I mean admittedly I didn't make an infinite does this keep getting shorter and shorter that not infinite well I suppose once again there's nothing to do here if you decide you've had enough of the hole you can hit the teleport button and come join me up above
[178:54.65]Had enough?
[178:55.57]I'm positively thrilled.
[178:58.05]Gosh, how could I have guessed?
[179:00.15]You're back in the hole.
[179:01.99]If this starts... Hey.
[179:04.75]Wow.
[179:05.81]Okay.
[179:06.87]Yeah.
[179:08.07]I'm starting to become extremely certain that the hole is not only not infinite, but that it's growing steadily less and less infinite.
[179:16.22]I suspect that I'm starting to hit the point where it's no longer feasible to call the hole infinitely deep.
[179:21.87]That was just a kind of big hole.
[179:25.53]What's going on here?
[179:27.45]Stanley, I have no explanation for the uncertain nature of the hole's length.
[179:32.06]Here, let's try something.
[179:34.13]Let's pop back up to the top and we'll see if it gets any shorter.
[179:37.57]Let's see it.
[179:38.45]Well, there it is.
[179:39.69]The shame of my life has come to haunt me.
[179:41.62]Woohoo!
[179:42.86]Ow!
[179:43.22]My fucking ankle.
[179:44.02]Ow!
[179:45.04]I know you're upset.
[179:45.72]Just twisted it.
[179:46.46]I stuffed it.
[179:46.94]I just bent it the other way.
[179:48.46]I just can't see this scratchy ledge.
[179:49.88]Fucking goddamn stupid ass fucking lip on the ledge.
[179:52.02]Who am I to judge?
[179:53.56]You just do whatever it is you're here to do and hit the teleport button when you're ready to move on.
[179:58.89]That fucking hurt.
[180:00.93]That rolled my goddamn ankle.
[180:04.24]Hmm.
[180:05.69]Is the teleport button not working?
[180:08.57]You sure?
[180:11.27]Well, I mean... What'd you do?
[180:12.93]I really don't have an explanation.
[180:14.52]It was working just a moment ago.
[180:16.16]Try it again.
[180:20.46]Still nothing.
[180:22.07]I can't climb out of here?
[180:23.96]Hey!
[180:24.04]I have a bucket, though.
[180:24.80]I can turn the bucket around, step on it, and get out.
[180:56.60]Every pause button is a Roman numeral.
[181:00.31]Just the two of us.
[181:01.01]We can make it if we try.
[181:01.93]Just the two of us.
[181:02.53]Just the two of us.
[181:03.11]Just the two of us building castles.
[181:06.15]Meeting at 2 p.m.
[181:07.05]Sincerely, Management.
[181:14.59]Am I actually stuck in here?
[181:15.55]Uh...
[181:27.49]Well, goodbye.
[181:51.04]Change your perspective.
[182:15.49]Change your perception?
[182:43.35]this is the this is the part where the bugs start crawling all over everybody this is the exact music that gets played when like like just like roaches are just like everywhere and your reality
[183:15.12]I stopped.
[183:46.84]What the fuck?
[183:48.78]Wait, is it like cartoon music?
[183:59.11]Stanley?
[184:00.77]Actually, leave me alone, this is fun.
[184:03.27]Oh good, you're awake.
[184:04.49]It seems you had sort of dozed off there, drifting away into dreamland.
[184:08.77]But we can't have that, Stanley.
[184:10.41]Because this hole is just so darn fascinating that I want you to be wide awake for every second of it.
[184:16.73]Is this payback for all the skipping?
[184:17.79]This is my punishment for all the fast-forwarding.
[184:20.24]Are we doing it again?
[184:50.25]No.
[184:58.20]Back out here.
[184:58.58]OK.
[184:58.64]Go back to the hole.
[185:02.90]That's what I was thinking.
[185:21.94]Just go back to the hole.
[185:34.63]Yeah, I can get another bucket too.
[185:36.75]Should I get two buckets?
[185:37.57]Alright, I'm going to get two buckets and I'm going back to the hole.
[185:41.16]And then I'm going to get... Wait.
[185:43.68]I can get two out of six, right?
[185:45.58]Hold on, let me do this first.
[185:56.14]Wait, what?
[185:56.88]I can't get it again?
[185:57.42]Another one?
[185:59.30]Shit.
[186:04.11]Are they actually hidden?
[186:04.89]I need to do dual welding.
[186:08.47]I will dual weld, don't worry.
[186:20.00]Can I get another one?
[186:26.55]I can't get a second bucket.
[186:29.77]I can only have one.
[186:36.10]It doesn't reset.
[186:36.66]It just sends you the... Yeah, okay.
[186:37.78]Alright, I want to go back to the hole.
[186:44.84]Oh, the balloons are actually here now.
[186:46.48]That's funny.
[186:52.60]Alright, hold time.
[186:53.18]I want to go back in here.
[186:58.00]You should do the clown world.
[187:00.42]I figured there was probably a clown world.
[187:05.04]Hey!
[187:07.94]You gonna lock me out?
[187:08.72]I can't even go in there.
[187:16.41]That's horse shit.
[187:19.99]Okay, so where can I go?
[187:22.98]That's new.
[187:25.06]What's new over here?
[187:28.07]Did I go that way?
[187:31.67]That's new.
[187:32.75]How do I get in that door?
[187:35.18]How do I get up there?
[187:36.26]How do I get up there?
[187:46.19]Oh, I can go up here.
[187:52.92]Mostly infinite hole.
[187:56.02]Settings world championship.
[187:57.72]Alright, let's do that.
[188:06.11]Why is that closed?
[188:06.73]What are you talking about?
[188:08.83]It's closed?
[188:14.10]What's this?
[188:18.18]Check your settings.
[188:33.60]How do I do it?
[188:37.42]Should I just change every single setting?
[188:39.10]I did these.
[188:45.04]Okay.
[189:09.15]Okay.
[189:19.76]What the fuck?
[189:20.60]Okay.
[189:26.08]Was it 86?
[189:26.36]Alright, video.
[189:29.54]V-Sync.
[189:30.02]I have to do every single thing?
[189:35.13]I don't want to turn, like, V-Sync off.
[189:41.91]Res x res.
[189:43.11]I can't change this.
[189:48.05]What is res x res?
[189:49.49]Okay.
[190:06.19]Okay.
[190:26.15]We'll do every setting in checkbox.
[190:29.48]Alright, I did every one of these.
[190:30.74]I did every one of these.
[190:32.14]I did every one of these.
[190:33.66]Did I get it?
[190:51.43]Did I get it?
[190:55.52]I missed one.
[190:58.18]Every single language?
[190:59.44]Okay.
[191:09.52]Sound effect volume?
[191:10.48]Okay.
[191:17.34]Use every slider to maximum, then go through each number individually with the right key.
[191:21.75]Shut up.
[191:26.71]No way.
[191:57.50]Okay, that part actually was a troll.
[191:59.22]Alright, well, fuck.
[192:00.82]Alright, so did I do it?
[192:01.60]I think I clicked every single one of these.
[192:06.74]I did every single one.
[192:08.02]Is it open?
[192:20.03]You'd get an achievement thing if you did it.
[192:21.51]I know.
[192:28.43]I missed one of the sub settings.
[192:41.75]Which one?
[193:22.37]Where's my achievement?
[193:28.04]Click through res x res?
[193:31.34]What is res x res?
[193:36.20]Simplified control.
[193:37.18]I did that already.
[193:42.48]Just Google it.
[193:45.32]I did it!
[193:45.74]I did everything!
[193:52.72]Rebind the simplified controls.
[193:55.15]Are you fucking kidding me?
[194:16.49]Set all settings sliders in the menu to all the available numbers.
[194:24.43]What?
[194:25.69]Didn't I do that?
[194:26.29]I don't actually have to do this, right?
[194:48.21]That counts.
[195:01.27]Okay, that counts.
[195:04.19]Joel!
[195:04.57]What's up, Joel?
[195:06.27]Thanks for the raid.
[195:06.85]Welcome, everybody from Joel's stream.
[195:10.51]We're currently really trying to 5-head our way through The Stanley Parable 2.
[195:14.31]Hope you had a good stream.
[195:20.04]Worst stream 2020- Please.
[195:24.93]I have to- Okay, if you're wondering what I'm doing right now, all the viewers from Joel, I have to put every single slider to each individual number that it can possibly be to open this door.
[195:41.26]That's a spoiler, by the way.
[195:42.24]Hopefully you've already played it.
[195:44.18]If not, then holy smokes, I'm sorry.
[195:49.24]Check the website.
[196:01.47]I'll help you.
[196:02.17]You can drag the sliders, but you need to be on every number once.
[196:06.02]Also, enable all checkboxes and check their sub-settings.
[196:08.96]A friendly dev.
[196:12.98]I think I got it.
[196:21.81]Okay, it's done.
[196:22.85]I just need to do this now.
[196:25.87]Okay.
[196:47.77]On, on, off, off, off, off.
[196:53.10]Did I do it?
[196:53.52]This dude's unhinged.
[197:01.70]Alright, audio.
[197:17.95]What?
[197:19.31]You can slide?
[197:21.49]But I did it!
[197:21.93]I already did it!
[197:24.45]I already clicked on everything, look!
[197:27.75]The arrow suboptions?
[197:29.78]Big cat?
[197:31.26]Why am I a big cat?
[197:33.32]Where are the suboptions?
[197:35.02]Aren't these... This is the only suboption.
[197:39.07]Where are the other suboptions?
[197:40.67]I can't change the resolution.
[197:44.03]Are there any more suboptions?
[197:55.95]Okay, field of view.
[197:56.99]I did field of view.
[198:00.51]I did this.
[198:01.73]I did this.
[198:02.49]Invert.
[198:02.89]Why?
[198:03.21]I think I did everything.
[198:08.94]Check the website.
[198:15.34]You have audio, video, and controls.
[198:17.04]You missed some sub settings in general.
[198:19.30]I did?
[198:22.02]Where are they?
[198:23.66]Video.
[198:26.56]Is this sub-settings in video?
[198:36.23]Where are they?
[198:42.67]They said general.
[198:45.67]What?
[198:49.02]What are you talking about?
[198:54.41]You missed some sub-settings in general.
[198:59.12]Where?
[199:07.91]Subtitles off?
[199:14.33]I think I pressed every button.
[199:16.01]In general.
[199:17.83]Audio, please.
[199:18.57]I did it already!
[199:25.15]Yo, I pressed, I pressed every button!
[199:28.57]I pressed every button!
[199:29.99]I pressed every single, the general tab?
[199:32.33]I pressed every fucking button like 50 times!
[199:36.61]Dude, I pressed every single button, okay?
[199:39.45]On, on, one-handed walking.
[199:41.41]Presentation.
[199:43.01]English!

[199:48.14]This.
[199:49.02]Slide.
[199:50.54]Australia.
[199:52.14]This is all the way.
[199:54.20]Look, okay, this too!
[200:01.58]What am I missing?
[200:02.36]You have to toggle some settings first to see the sub-options?
[200:12.45]What?!
[200:15.31]What the fuck?!
[200:17.57]Wait, I did!
[200:18.45]Where are these other sub-options?
[200:25.37]website in general like translation labels I need to go to bed just keep playing this bit isn't super important also follow us on Twitter at crows x3 we deserve it after all this tech support in general like translation what do you mean like translation labels what are you translation labels yeah I did this already I did it already
[201:12.83]How do I get out of here?
[201:13.71]What's with my mouse?
[201:18.68]What the fuck is wrong with my computer?
[201:21.02]It worked, it worked, it worked, it worked.
[201:22.15]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[201:23.78]my controls are inverted I can see you've gotten the settings world champion achievement well done you've experienced every setting I'm inverted to all corners of the settings menu there's nothing you haven't seen so just for you dude I did that already too I'm including an entirely new setting something called bump viscosity what exactly is bump viscosity well I haven't
[201:50.18]embarrassing it wasn't embarrassing I trust everybody adjust it on some sort of slider and that it'll be available from the settings menu we'll sort the rest of the details out later I hope you're looking forward to trying out every level of bump scarcity in The Stanley Parable 2.
[202:10.36]Alright, first of all, I gotta turn all this stuff off.
[202:14.94]I have a ton of shit on.
[202:16.42]Like my field of view.
[202:17.36]Alright, invert no control of vibration.
[202:20.14]No, get out of here.
[202:22.74]English, subtitles, medium, with a little bit of opacity.
[202:26.94]I don't need all this.
[202:29.94]Okay.
[202:30.68]Is my video settings fine?
[202:34.04]No, we're good.
[202:34.62]Alright, we're good.
[202:35.12]Yeah, everything's fine.
[202:36.48]Okay.
[202:38.14]Bumpscocity.
[202:43.42]What is bumpscocity?
[202:53.77]A thousand?
[202:54.53]I appreciate the help though, Dev.
[203:04.73]I have a pea brain, so.
[203:08.61]There's a tweet now.
[203:09.31]I don't know.
[203:17.95]Everyone was so bad at following directions, it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago.
[203:27.28]But I- but I went- I did everything!
[203:33.42]Shit.
[203:40.42]Alright, so what does- what does bumpscocity do?
[203:55.79]Oh, this is the epilogue room.
[203:56.89]Okay.
[203:59.49]Very cool.
[204:04.29]Did I miss any of the rooms?
[204:05.13]Am I done?
[204:18.67]I'm done here?
[204:19.11]Okay.
[204:22.47]Oh, this is a cool area.
[204:27.15]Cool.
[204:27.33]Okay.
[204:34.33]That was a fun exhibit.
[204:39.41]Now where do I go?
[204:41.43]Can I leave?
[204:41.87]Oh, there's an exit.
[204:43.47]Right.
[204:46.51]Where is it?
[204:46.85]It's around here somewhere.
[204:49.83]Where's the exit?
[204:50.45]I think it's down here.
[204:53.77]Um...
[204:57.42]There it is.
[205:01.08]Yeah, I saw the tweet.
[205:01.76]I think so.
[205:03.36]I think I am.
[205:10.96]What is this?
[205:25.66]So, Stanley, what do you think?
[205:27.56]Do you like all of the new features?
[205:29.62]Yes, I know it's not exactly clear yet how exactly these features will come together as one single coherent video game, but I can feel it in my soul.
[205:38.60]It's going to work.
[205:40.02]There's definitely a good game in there somewhere.
[205:42.82]Say, let's do an experiment.
[205:45.06]I'll arrange these new features together, and we'll see whether or not it coheres into a meaningful gameplay experience.
[205:55.50]Okay.
[205:56.66]Are you ready?
[205:57.94]Here it is.
[205:58.46]I give you The Stanley Parable 2.
[206:07.67]What did the chapstick do?
[206:09.00]It's gone.
[206:10.36]I didn't eat it.
[206:10.88]Did I eat it?
[206:11.28]I didn't eat it.
[206:27.40]Well, that's... Who am I kidding, Stanley?
[206:31.38]This isn't a coherent video game at all.
[206:33.60]It's a lot of gags.
[206:35.28]And I do very much enjoy creating gags, but they don't add up to anything.
[206:39.12]I did need it.
[206:40.50]I wanted more than anything to create a sequel that would capture all the magic of the first game.
[206:46.41]I wanted fans to love it.
[206:48.13]No matter how good these gags are, they wouldn't stand on their own.
[206:51.35]They would need the structure and the gameplay of the original.
[206:54.43]Oh, yeah.
[206:54.87]Wait.
[206:56.01]Maybe that's it.
[206:57.53]I can take the original Stanley Parable and simply, well, insert a few of my new features into it.
[207:03.79]Tastefully, of course.
[207:05.35]With respect.
[207:06.61]With care for the vision and integrity of the original game.
[207:10.80]Would it possibly work?
[207:12.54]I suppose it could.
[207:13.60]But it would need a really, really tremendous title screen.
[207:17.32]A title screen that says with bold and uncompromising conviction, this is The Stanley Parable 2.
[207:26.19]Let me see if I can whip something up.
[207:27.99]Like the designs that were up front.
[207:29.95]Perfect.
[207:30.91]Go ahead.
[207:32.19]Take a look.
[207:36.70]Oh, look at that.
[207:38.54]Stanley Parable 2.
[207:49.87]Here we go.
[207:57.73]This is the story of a man named Stanley.
[208:02.75]Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.
[208:07.98]Employee number 427's job was simple.
[208:12.42]He sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.
[208:17.80]Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.
[208:26.02]This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year.
[208:32.03]Bumscocity looks crazy.
[208:33.35]Others might have considered it soul renting.
[208:35.99]Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in.
[208:39.04]It's a lot of Bumscocity.
[208:39.98]It's making me made exactly.
[208:41.73]The backs of my eyeballs are itchy.
[208:43.43]You know what I mean?
[208:44.82]That's kind of when a lot of bumpscocity happens.
[208:47.00]That's when you get... There's a lot.
[208:49.78]Something that would forever change Stanley.
[208:55.19]Something he would never quite forget.
[208:58.05]He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.
[209:06.67]No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say hi.
[209:12.75]Never in all his years at the company had this happened.
[209:16.28]This complete isolation.
[209:18.94]Something was very clearly wrong.
[209:21.60]Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.
[209:27.91]But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.
[209:33.87]Okay, so did I do the same thing I did last time?
[209:38.19]But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.
[209:40.87]That's like what I did last time, right?
[209:43.09]What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?
[209:46.33]He had never been trained for that.
[209:48.17]No.
[209:49.17]This couldn't go any way except badly.
[209:51.94]The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait.
[209:54.70]Does this change?
[209:55.34]Nothing will hurt me.
[209:56.96]This doesn't change?
[209:58.62]Oh, this is different.
[210:00.98]This is not different.
[210:03.88]Ah, this is not different.
[210:04.90]It was my bucket.
[210:17.89]Stop wasting our time.
[210:18.81]Alright, so that doesn't change.
[210:20.00]So what changed?
[210:42.03]Balloons are here.
[210:42.73]What about the brim closet?
[210:43.93]Ooh, my bucket!
[210:44.45]Nice.
[210:44.71]I feel happy now.
[210:45.39]Wait, that's two inputs now.
[210:46.13]Oh, every time I come back I do another input.
[210:48.11]I wonder what happens.
[211:14.18]That's cool.
[211:14.70]Alright.
[211:15.12]We'll find out in a minute.
[211:16.56]We'll check it out.
[211:25.51]Sure.
[211:40.78]Okay.
[211:40.92]This is open again.
[211:41.70]Nice.
[211:57.02]Oh, Stanley, can you feel it?
[211:59.36]The broom closet.
[212:00.48]It wants the bucket.
[212:01.40]No!
[212:01.72]You can feel that, can't you?
[212:03.21]No!
[212:03.35]No!
[212:03.49]No!
[212:03.63]No!
[212:18.81]Mine.
[212:29.80]Fine.
[212:29.98]Yeah, fuck this place.
[212:31.02]Yeah.
[212:31.14]Me neither do I. Yeah, fuck this place.
[212:54.49]Now the broom closet has the gall to imply that you and the bucket are not truly deep and lasting friends.
[213:00.42]What?
[213:00.88]That your relationship is purely superficial and convenient.
[213:03.64]Oh, shut up.
[213:03.90]That your life is super null and meaningless.
[213:06.58]When did they say that?
[213:07.16]That you feel the same sort of kinship towards any inanimate object which happened to lay in your path in an even partially enticing manner.
[213:14.56]Well, I never.
[213:16.04]I thought we were friends.
[213:17.75]Yeah.
[213:41.35]It stinks like a public bathroom in here.
[213:43.17]And the walls need to be painted.
[213:46.53]And... Okay, I've got you something which I think will help settle this debate once and for all.
[213:52.58]Here we go.
[213:54.76]Yeah, now it's settled.
[213:56.72]Yeah, no more debate.
[213:58.18]No more discussion.
[213:59.62]Take a hike room closet with all your meandering philosophical diatribes about the nature of cleaning supplies and their relationship to broom closets in the natural.
[214:09.17]Yeah.
[214:13.32]Fuck you, man.
[214:14.74]Fuck you.
[214:15.10]What are you gonna do?
[214:16.68]Fuck you.
[214:16.88]Alright, I've got a second sticker back here.
[214:18.84]Fuck up.
[214:19.12]And I'm going to slap it on as well because I think it's appropriate.
[214:22.83]Fuck up.
[214:23.55]You see?
[214:24.67]I feel that it works because the sticker is also a bucket.
[214:29.85]That way, if you're ever unsure whether the thing you're holding is a bucket or not, you can look down at this sticker and say to yourself, oh, it's a bucket.
[214:39.10]There really is a wide variety of applications for this sticker.
[214:43.56]Violence doesn't solve anything dude.
[214:47.77]I just like kicked this thing.
[214:49.15]I just kicked like this metal thing.
[214:50.75]I can take the name calling and the dismissal of your kinship with the bucket.
[214:54.39]But now the broom closet is just giving us a silent treatment.
[214:58.31]And to be honest, I'm sick of the pettiness on display.
[215:01.79]You can stay here all you like, but I've had it with this impetuous room of cleaning supplies.
[215:06.63]Easily the most childish such room I've ever been in.
[215:09.71]I'll see you outside and we can get on with the story about you and your bucket.
[215:18.27]Bro, you didn't really fucking say those things, did you?
[215:20.58]Did you say that shit?
[215:21.38]You didn't say those things, right, man?
[215:26.94]Really?
[215:29.08]What a... Disappointing.
[215:36.94]Disappointing.
[215:37.40]Okay!
[215:52.37]Ooh.
[215:52.57]Scared me.
[215:52.87]Why?
[215:53.53]Okay.
[216:16.77]To be rich, is it a crime?
[216:17.87]To commit crimes, isn't it rich?
[216:19.43]What a life it would be to have to pick just one.
[216:25.59]You definitely aren't cleaning this every day and like you just use your bathroom wall to write all this shit and somebody else has to take it off and then you come back and do it again.
[216:34.70]You're annoying somebody here and like you should just stop.
[216:39.08]Write it on a fucking notepad.
[216:51.60]Wait!
[216:51.74]Got it.
[216:52.02]What about the piano?
[217:22.34]Nothing with the piano?
[217:24.56]Nothing with the piano?
[217:32.43]Hey, don't I die here?
[217:33.27]Ooh.
[217:35.01]I only need three more.
[217:35.77]Stanley.
[217:36.13]Stanley.
[217:52.22]Okay.
[217:52.40]What happens when I get six?
[217:53.70]Treatment.
[217:55.36]Thank you.
[217:55.62]Alright, this time I'm going to turn the mind control thing on.
[218:02.20]Go back up?
[218:04.46]I can't.
[218:08.83]The elevator raced downward, plummeting towards an unknown fate.
[218:14.20]It would be all Stanley could do to keep himself together, if not for the bucket.
[218:18.86]Soothing him, comforting him, reassuring that in this darkest moment of uncertainty, he would be alright.
[218:25.91]The bucket is here for you, Stanley.
[218:28.19]Everything will be fine.
[218:33.59]Alright.
[218:36.49]Stanley and the bucket walk straight ahead through the large door that read Mind Control Facility.
[218:42.28]Okay.
[218:42.96]Okay.
[218:45.29]I could go that way, or I could go this way with the bucket.
[218:52.57]I'm gonna turn it on.
[218:55.93]I'm gonna turn it on.
[219:00.73]What happens when you turn it on?
[219:02.41]The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.
[219:07.04]What horrible secret did this place hold?
[219:09.76]Stanley and the bucket both wondered to themselves.
[219:17.65]Yeah, I'm going to turn it on and see what happens.
[219:18.99]I want to do the input thing again.
[219:25.45]The monitors jumped to life and Stanley nearly dropped the bucket in shock.
[219:29.91]Everyone in the office was being videotaped, monitored like Guinea pigs.
[219:35.56]The bucket had never seen anything like this, and it very nearly burst into tears as Stanley gravely gently reassuring it that everything would be fine.
[219:46.90]OK.
[219:50.21]Yeah, live bucket reaction.
[219:52.11]Okay, if I put the bucket on my head, will the mind control radiation get through the bucket?
[220:22.42]no he screamed into the bucket he couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control never he squeezed the bucket tighter his one friend in the entire world at this point he could trust no one except for the bucket
[220:40.06]Where did I just go?
[220:41.50]Wait, did I just leave?
[220:42.36]Oh no, wait, what?
[220:44.67]Oh yeah.
[220:58.77]And as the cold reality of his past began to sink in, Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human life.
[221:08.72]What if I walk down here?
[221:09.52]For he and the bucket would dismantle the controls for good.
[221:13.72]Two best friends, Stanley and the bucket, up against the world.
[221:18.80]They high-fived in a really cool way, and the bucket made a sassy comment about taking down the system.
[221:25.07]Okay, so let's turn it on.
[221:31.59]I want to turn this on.
[221:32.13]And to everything it stood for.
[221:50.23]But at the last second, the bucket jumped in and pressed the button to turn on the controls.
[221:54.94]Double cross.
[221:55.54]Stanley gasped in horror.
[221:58.00]Had this been the bucket's plan all along?
[222:00.48]To take over the machine and claim the power for itself?
[222:04.31]How could the bucket have betrayed him like this?
[222:06.63]Stanley was prepared to throw the bucket away in disgust when suddenly an image appeared upon the enormous screen.
[222:15.16]Silly birds.
[222:16.56]Okay, do I want eagle or do I want sparrow?
[222:19.61]Sparrow.
[222:34.36]Stanley flipped through one video of silly birds after another, and then it dawned on him.
[222:39.50]This wasn't a mind control facility at all.
[222:42.49]What is it?
[222:42.85]It was a facility for monitoring and surveilling silly birds all over the world.
[222:48.89]What a silly bird.
[222:49.47]The mind controls were only a facade to disguise its true intentions.
[222:54.44]Had the bucket known this all along?
[222:56.74]Stanley marveled at the metal genius in his hands, the one who had pointed him towards this incredible discovery.
[223:03.74]Oh, wow.
[223:04.10]They look like robots.
[223:04.58]Like mechanical.
[223:05.00]No!
[223:05.08]I want to see more of those.
[223:06.46]Don't cut me off.
[223:07.16]I want to see more of that.
[223:39.29]When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[223:43.69]Where's my bucket?
[223:45.93]This was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well.
[223:50.43]Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just to admire it.
[223:54.48]I can't do it without the bucket.
[223:56.80]I'm nothing without the bucket.
[223:58.28]If you're nothing without the bucket, then you're nothing.
[223:59.70]You don't deserve the bucket.
[224:01.48]Stanley felt lightheaded.
[224:03.00]Butterflies in his stomach.
[224:04.62]Giddy in a way he had never known before.
[224:07.74]I've never gone this way.
[224:08.46]No.
[224:08.52]I went this way.
[224:34.03]But Stanley didn't want to go back to the office.
[224:36.49]He wanted to wander about and get even further off track.
[224:40.15]So now in order to get back, he needed to go... Left.
[224:50.39]Right.
[224:56.46]Oh, no.
[224:57.30]No, it's to the right, my mistake.
[225:02.57]No, no, no, no, not the right.
[225:05.19]Why would I have ever said it was to the right?
[225:07.99]What was I thinking?
[225:09.93]It's clearly... Oh dear, would you hold on for a minute, please?
[225:13.05]That door.
[225:13.31]Is Duke going to bomb rip?
[225:17.35]Let's see, we went down right, left, down, left, right.
[225:22.79]Yep, yep, okay, okay, yes.
[225:25.13]I've got it now.
[225:25.93]This story is absolutely, definitely this way.
[225:29.34]Okay, wait.
[225:33.07]Can't go that way.
[225:33.57]I have to go this way.
[225:34.73]It's kind of scary.
[225:46.86]Oh, the mind control room.
[225:48.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[225:49.92]This isn't right at all.
[225:50.86]You're not supposed to be here yet.
[225:52.28]This is all a spoiler.
[225:53.76]Quick, Stanley, close your eyes.
[225:55.02]I already saw this.
[225:56.34]Okay, okay, okay.
[225:57.20]We just had to get back to... Who am I kidding?
[226:01.68]It's all rubbish now.
[226:03.22]Oh, he's sending me back to the beginning.
[226:04.53]Rubbish.
[226:04.77]Alright, where's my bucket?
[226:21.45]All of his co-workers were gone.
[226:23.50]What could it mean?
[226:25.04]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[226:27.04]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[226:29.12]Where's the input thing, right?
[226:31.28]It was... I could do the input thing?
[226:35.54]I can't.
[226:35.96]It's not down there.
[226:36.66]It's not there.
[226:38.98]Input.
[226:42.75]Input.
[226:43.99]Come on, let me do input three.
[226:45.05]Really?
[226:47.41]Really?
[226:48.79]Really?
[226:50.48]And the bucket's not here either.
[226:52.02]That's sad.
[226:53.70]That's really sad.
[226:54.64]I don't have my bucket.
[226:55.32]How am I supposed to ever play this game again?
[227:02.60]I missed the bucket?
[227:05.34]I didn't have my bucket.
[227:26.09]Oh, God.
[227:26.25]Um... This one?
[228:06.26]Oh, by the way, I got Blood Wash and Murder House.
[228:11.12]No, I'll find it.
[228:11.68]I got it.
[228:12.32]I got it.
[228:12.54]I got it.
[228:12.82]No, I got it.
[228:13.22]I just got it.
[228:13.76]Oh, my.
[228:33.86]another one of those kind of short horror games right all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean Stanley decided to go to the meeting room if you guys have any more of those like two to three hours short horror games I you're so much louder than the game am I am I good
[229:00.71]Where did the doors go?
[229:02.19]Oh, dude, it's because of this.
[229:02.83]It's because I turned everything down.
[229:04.03]Where's my game?
[229:05.03]I paid for a fucking game.
[229:06.15]I paid for a game and it's not here?
[229:29.67]I'm just quitting.
[229:30.31]I'm quitting.
[229:42.94]Uh... Aha!
[229:45.38]I knew we'd miss something.
[229:47.28]What?
[229:47.56]The story.
[229:49.16]Here it comes.
[229:53.17]No, wait.
[229:53.91]Never mind.
[229:54.69]Not the story.
[229:55.33]What the fuck?
[229:55.89]Okay, let's head back the other way and retrace our steps.
[230:07.05]Well, I'll be honest.
[230:09.01]I don't recognize this place at all.
[230:10.96]Is this the story?
[230:12.34]I don't think so.
[230:13.78]I can't quite recall, but I believe my story took place in an office building.
[230:18.54]Is that correct?
[230:20.85]Do you remember, Stanley?
[230:22.76]Well, do you know what?
[230:23.84]Since I've completely forgotten what we were supposed to be doing, how about this?
[230:27.60]No, don't restart the game again.
[230:28.76]You win.
[230:29.52]Congratulations.
[230:32.30]Oh, that worked.
[230:32.68]I know you put in a lot of hard work, and it really paid off.
[230:35.68]So, good job.
[230:39.14]Oh, no.
[230:40.48]No, I don't feel right about this at all.
[230:42.36]I did it.
[230:43.16]We both know you didn't put in any actual work for that win.
[230:46.48]Some people win fair and square, and this was not one of those situations.
[230:51.25]Stanley Parable 2 Adventure Line.
[230:52.72]Okay.
[230:52.94]That's more like it.
[230:53.68]No input?
[230:53.94]Oh well.
[231:22.97]Okay.
[231:23.31]Everybody left.
[231:35.65]No, no, I'm down.
[231:36.63]We're leaving it up to the line from now on.
[231:46.96]Alright, fine.
[231:51.30]Fine.
[231:57.88]okay you see the line knows where the story is it's over in this direction onward Stanley to destiny
[232:19.80]though here's a thought wouldn't wherever we end up be our destination even if there's no story there no or to put it another way is the story of no destination still a story no simply by the act of moving forward are we implying a journey such that a destination is inevitably conjured into being via the very manifestation of the nature of life itself okay Stanley I need to follow this train of thought for a minute just stick with me
[232:46.95]I'll let you finish it.
[232:47.65]Now we can both agree that the nature of existence is in fact a byproduct of one's subjective experience of that existence.
[232:55.74]I'm just waiting for my turn to talk.
[232:57.52]I'm not listening at all.
[232:58.44]I'm just waiting for my turn to talk.
[233:00.24]...rests inside of your subjective experience of this office.
[233:04.30]Is this office in fact the skeleton of my own relative experiential mental subjective construct?
[233:10.76]Hang on.
[233:12.94]I agree.
[233:13.18]A story is a narrative construct.
[234:32.33]I got- I missed the line.
[234:33.75]I didn't do it right.
[234:39.33]Wait, what?
[234:46.02]Wait, what?
[234:58.51]Way too dang- Cut the music.
[235:00.21]Go back and look at that fern.
[235:03.64]Stanley, this fern will be very important later in the story.
[235:08.43]Make sure you study it closely and remember it carefully.
[235:12.39]You won't want to miss anything.
[235:13.61]I think I understand the shape and the size and the directions it's going.
[235:23.20]That's a fern.
[235:23.56]I think I got it.
[235:24.20]Okay, I got it.
[235:24.50]It's a fern.
[235:26.26]It's a fern.
[235:28.78]Whatever.
[235:29.92]It's a fern.
[235:32.42]Wait, we're back at the office?
[235:34.94]No, no, no.
[235:37.01]Line, you do know we're looking for The Stanley Parable, right?
[235:40.09]The story?
[235:41.33]Is any of this ringing a bell?
[235:47.05]Um, this way?
[235:58.90]I guess not.
[236:14.08]Oh, no, no, no, no, not again.
[236:16.70]How could you have done this to us?
[236:18.38]And after we trusted you, after everything we've been through, you know, I can't take this anymore to hell with it.
[236:24.79]Restart.
[236:28.21]Did I follow the line still?
[236:32.16]You know what, Stanley?
[236:33.68]I say forget the adventure line.
[236:35.37]What's it ever done for us?
[236:36.87]We're intelligent people, right?
[236:38.71]Why can't we make up our own story?
[236:40.41]Yeah, we could.
[236:40.89]Something exciting, daring, mysterious.
[236:44.03]Ooh, this all sounds perfectly doable.
[236:46.39]Why don't we simply start wandering in, well, I don't know, how about this direction?
[237:00.80]I want to be a knight.
[237:03.36]I want to be a knight.
[237:04.67]The staff.
[237:21.30]It has spells.
[237:22.96]And I want to fight a dragon and I want to win.
[237:25.36]I don't care about anything else.
[237:27.02]You'd be a lion?
[237:27.42]Yeah, I would be a lion.
[237:53.86]Ah, a choice.
[237:55.53]We get to make a decision.
[237:57.27]From here, the story is in our control.
[238:00.13]How important we mustn't squander the opportunity.
[238:03.29]In fact, I believe I need a minute to think here.
[238:05.96]Just walk in circles for a minute.
[238:08.53]okay so I know that each door has to lead somewhere which means that somewhere the place where we're trying to go this is fun to walk around this door that leads here and that in turn means that our destination corresponds with the counter inverted reverse doors origin so starting from the right let us ask will taking the right door lead us to where we're going
[238:35.33]And since the answer is clearly yes, then by all accounts, the door on the right is the correct one.
[238:40.91]No, it's not.
[238:41.38]Another victory for logic.
[238:43.30]Come, Stanley.
[238:44.68]Our destiny awaits.
[238:49.02]This is my only choice I have to go through?
[238:50.38]I have to?
[238:50.76]Can I just do this?
[238:57.51]This is kind of fun.
[239:03.53]I'm breaking the rules now.
[239:08.51]Just wanted to be a little bit edgy there.
[239:12.25]Hold up, what's this?
[239:15.71]Confusion ending?
[239:17.48]You're telling me that's what this is?
[239:20.42]It's all one giant ending?
[239:22.90]And we're supposed to restart the game eight times?
[239:28.08]That's really how all this goes?
[239:30.94]It's all determined?
[239:34.01]So now, according to the schedule, I restart again.
[239:36.57]Then what?
[239:37.59]Am I just supposed to forget?
[239:38.92]Well, what if I don't want to forget?
[239:41.79]My mind goes blank simply because it's written here on this thing.
[239:45.79]Follow the line after Long Stanley dies.
[239:48.09]I die.
[239:50.62]Why don't I get to decide?
[239:52.44]Why don't I get a say in all of this?
[239:54.36]Find a bookstore.
[239:56.56]No, it can't be.
[239:58.10]I don't want it to be.
[239:58.98]I don't want the game to keep restarting.
[240:01.74]I don't want to forget what's going on.
[240:03.88]I don't want to be trapped like this.
[240:05.41]I won't restart the game.
[240:06.97]I won't do it.
[240:08.11]I won't do it.
[240:09.27]I won't do it.
[240:11.51]I don't want to do that.
[240:12.77]I don't want to see you there.
[240:14.13]And I don't want to see the turtle.
[240:15.54]Wearing a hat?
[240:16.62]Somebody said he's going to do it.
[240:18.20]You were fucking right.
[240:35.54]I guess now we just wait.
[240:37.00]You know, I suppose in some way that this is a kind of story.
[240:40.91]Wouldn't you agree?
[240:41.71]I'm not quite sure if we're in the destination or the journey.
[240:45.51]Though they're always saying that life is about the journey and not the destination.
[240:49.99]Why is the counter off?
[240:52.57]We'll find out, won't we?
[240:54.05]Eventually.
[240:55.65]Well, in the meantime... Hey!
[240:58.53]What the fuck?
[240:59.80]Ow!
[241:01.26]What happened?
[241:04.48]What was that?
[241:05.26]That was ridiculous.
[241:06.30]That hurt.
[241:09.04]All of his co-workers were gone.
[241:11.10]What could it mean?
[241:12.60]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[241:14.60]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[241:16.04]He's gonna do it.
[241:20.55]Meeting today in the meeting room.
[241:22.79]Nope.
[241:25.09]Stanley lifted the bucket into his arms and a wave of comfort rushed over him.
[241:31.33]Stanley pressed the bucket upon every little thing in the office.
[241:34.96]Nothing responded to the bucket's touch.
[241:37.38]But it did little to discourage Stanley's belief in the magic of the bucket.
[241:47.14]Let's go!
[241:47.63]They didn't check the input?
[241:53.37]I didn't see it.
[241:59.86]Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left.
[242:12.47]This was not the correct way to the meeting room, but Stanley had felt the bucket calling to him, telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be.
[242:28.32]And here it was.
[242:29.42]Had the bucket turned out to be correct?
[242:31.36]Was this better than the meeting room?
[242:33.44]Yes, Stanley thought to himself.
[242:35.14]Yes, perhaps it truly was.
[242:36.94]Stupid fucking idiot.
[242:38.92]Never mind.
[242:40.10]The bucket was wrong.
[242:42.28]Stanley took the door on his left to go back to the meeting room.
[242:51.02]I haven't gone up there.
[242:52.15]Okay, I'm going to go over here.
[242:53.13]No, said the bucket.
[242:55.17]Don't go to the meeting room.
[242:56.75]Go somewhere else.
[242:58.15]The cargo lift.
[242:59.03]Yes, go there.
[243:00.57]Go to the cargo lift.
[243:03.79]Every audio book you've ever listened to in your life.
[243:11.62]Good, said the bucket.
[243:13.32]Now ride the lift all the way to the top.
[243:15.66]There's something up there I need you to do.
[243:17.88]I'm going up.
[243:18.44]Stanley did not question why or how this bucket was speaking to him.
[243:22.25]It should have alarmed him, of course, because buckets can't talk.
[243:25.31]But Stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact.
[243:28.63]He was firmly convinced that the bucket had spoken to him, and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked.
[243:34.47]Okay.
[243:40.95]In here, said the bucket.
[243:42.55]Go into this dark room over here.
[243:45.15]Stanley once again obeyed blindly.
[243:48.83]I love the bucket voice.
[243:51.21]The bucket voice is amazing.
[243:52.35]Okay.
[243:57.45]What else do you want me to do?
[243:58.25]Bucket?
[244:07.41]Hey!
[244:09.19]Now pick up the phone, said the bucket.
[244:11.59]Pick up the phone and it will take us back home where we can go about life together.
[244:18.67]I just, again, I just see the, in the studio with the glasses down here, like this reading the script.
[244:26.40]I like just see it.
[244:27.28]I love it.
[244:27.86]I just, it's just so comfortable to me.
[244:30.05]It's so comfortable to me.
[244:35.64]Okay.
[245:09.59]My friend, take me to work with you.
[245:12.97]Okay.
[245:21.65]The Stanley Parable reassurance bucket was merely meant to provide the comforting glow of companionship.
[245:27.39]It doesn't literally talk and give you orders.
[245:30.33]Whatever Stanley is hearing the bucket say to him is just in his head.
[245:39.76]You mean it wasn't talking to me?
[245:40.82]It was just... It was you the whole time?
[245:44.18]Cheap.
[245:47.04]That's fucking cheap.
[245:52.21]Take me back home with you, okay?
[245:53.61]What?
[245:55.59]Next time.
[245:56.19]Dev Twitter.
[245:56.85]Dev Twitter.
[245:57.17]What?
[245:57.43]Hold on, hold on.
[246:15.66]What's the- what's on the dev's Twitter?
[246:30.56]Oh, I've seen this, yeah.
[246:32.61]I've seen this.
[246:34.73]All of his co-workers were gone.
[246:37.63]I- I- I- I- I don't know where it is.
[246:39.45]I have no idea where my other shoe is.
[246:45.85]I've seen it.
[246:47.89]Scroll down.
[246:49.97]What?
[246:57.42]Okay.
[246:58.50]All of his co-workers.
[246:59.50]Yeah.
[247:00.66]Jerma was so bad at following directions.
[247:02.30]It was incredible he wasn't fired.
[247:03.82]Yeah, I've seen it.
[247:08.40]Yeah, I saw that video.
[247:10.12]It's funny.
[247:11.75]That's from a while ago.
[247:12.41]That's from like a year ago.
[247:21.02]Yeah, I've seen it.
[247:22.34]It's fun.
[247:30.01]Go back to work?
[247:31.12]Do I sleep?
[247:31.90]Why am I just going back and forth here?
[247:33.78]I'm just going back and forth without eating or sleeping?
[247:35.48]What a huge deal.
[247:35.88]That literally changed the course of all humanity.
[247:59.14]basic tools made us gain consciousness, essentially.
[248:03.52]Like, the idea of the bucket, of the stone axe, of the wheel, that changed the course of human history.
[248:14.39]Don't listen to the loud man.
[248:15.47]Press P for us to go back home.
[248:17.13]Yes, let's go.
[248:19.87]Not anymore.
[248:20.61]Not anymore.
[248:20.89]Ignore anyone in your life except me.
[248:43.43]It's sad.
[248:44.53]I suppose he doesn't need me anymore.
[248:46.71]From now on, he's just going to cling to this bucket.
[248:49.42]This cold, empty bucket.
[248:51.70]This sort of shiny bucket.
[248:55.26]Well, I'll give it this.
[248:56.12]The bucket does have a nice shine to it.
[248:58.06]It is very shiny.
[248:58.78]And it makes fun noises, too.
[249:04.26]You believe I'm real, don't you, Stanley?
[249:06.34]Go back home.
[249:10.33]Yes, I suppose on closer inspection that it doesn't quite look like your average hardware store bucket.
[249:16.51]It's just a little more, um... What am I trying to say?
[249:19.09]Yeah, plus I can put it in my head.
[249:20.21]I can put it over my head.
[249:21.15]And go like this.
[249:22.11]And I didn't think it was funny.
[249:42.23]Relive the same day with me over and over and over again.
[249:47.39]Oh, my God.
[249:48.13]What am I saying?
[249:49.77]Better at carrying water from room to room.
[249:52.19]It's a bucket.
[249:53.17]It's literally just a bucket.
[249:55.79]Why do I feel some need to point out the ways in which it's so much more than just a regular bucket?
[250:03.91]Because it is a coin.
[250:05.35]It's just a coin, which it is.
[250:08.83]You know that line that I just watched, but you know what I mean?
[250:13.31]What the fuck?
[250:13.67]No, this is my ring.
[250:15.53]I have the one bucket to rule us all, not you.
[250:18.75]It's mine.
[250:19.13]Mine.
[250:43.52]Stanley, give me the bucket.
[250:45.49]No.
[250:46.19]Give me the bucket, Stanley.
[250:46.93]No, it's my bucket.
[250:47.69]I need it.
[250:48.15]No.
[250:48.51]Give it to me now.
[250:49.41]No.
[250:56.33]Go back to work, Stanley.
[251:06.39]It better not be gone or I'm going to be really pissed off.
[251:10.13]Where is it?
[251:10.41]Where is it?
[251:10.89]Thank goodness.
[251:11.41]The confusion and the chaos all seemed to melt away as Stanley embraced the bucket.
[251:39.86]Thank goodness.
[251:41.92]Input, input, input.
[251:43.50]I didn't see a computer.
[251:44.14]I looked at the computers.
[251:46.02]I didn't see one.
[251:48.14]With an input on it.
[251:48.88]Look.
[251:52.62]I didn't see one.
[252:01.95]How do I get in?
[252:02.49]Oh.
[252:07.73]Go to the phone again?
[252:08.45]Should I do another phone ending?
[252:10.19]Okay.
[252:16.44]That's right.
[252:30.52]No.
[252:30.60]No, he didn't.
[252:45.60]I missed the bucket.
[252:47.46]Out of the top of my mouth.
[252:49.03]I missed the bucket.
[252:49.93]Out of the top of my mouth.
[252:52.43]I missed the bucket.
[252:53.23]We're all going to run.
[252:53.81]Mr. Bucket.
[252:54.05]Buckets up, son.
[252:54.49]Jump off the lift.
[252:55.29]No.
[253:17.42]But Stanley feared that any path he walked might lead to the separation of himself and the bucket, his dearest friend.
[253:24.58]So he threw himself to his death that they might die in one another's arms.
[253:29.44]How deeply touching.
[253:35.29]I'm gonna do the phone.
[253:36.25]I'm gonna go to the phone.
[253:37.27]I'm gonna go to the phone.
[253:38.77]I'm gonna go to the phone.
[253:39.37]Hey!
[253:49.98]I'm gonna go to the phone.
[253:50.52]You did the phone with the bucket already?
[253:52.02]Did I?
[253:52.24]Was there something else I could do with the phone?
[254:15.36]No, said the bucket.
[254:17.42]Don't go to the meeting room.
[254:18.98]Go somewhere else.
[254:20.38]The cargo lift, yes.
[254:21.64]Whoa, what about this way?
[254:22.46]Good, said the bucket.
[254:24.26]Now ride the lift all the way to the top.
[254:26.59]There's something up there I need you to do.
[254:29.43]There's a shiny on the left.
[254:31.82]There is a shiny.
[254:33.02]What?
[254:33.22]I'll go back.
[254:33.62]What?
[254:33.76]Look at that.
[254:34.12]We'll do that next.
[254:50.18]Okay, phone.
[254:50.70]Phone rings.
[254:51.77]Don't answer the phone instead.
[254:53.63]Pick up the phone and it will take us back home where we can go about...
[255:08.71]I felt like it.
[255:27.15]The bucket was talking.
[255:27.81]The bucket had a different voice than you.
[255:29.05]What?
[255:56.16]What is comedic timing?
[255:58.32]What is comedic timing?
[256:01.55]How does it work?
[256:02.93]How long should it last?
[256:04.93]How can it be used to effectively silence your political enemies?
[256:09.03]And more importantly, can it be taught in its entirety within 90 seconds?
[256:13.39]Thankfully, the answer to all of these questions is yes.
[256:18.46]Let's dive deeper.
[256:20.81]If you've ever told a joke or made someone laugh, in all likelihood, you did it while standing 50 to 80 centimeters from them in a room of no more than 76 degrees Fahrenheit, with one of your arms raised straight upward at a 15 degree angle from your body.
[256:37.22]These are the optimal conditions for good comedic timing.
[256:41.40]To begin the joke, start by stating and spelling your name.
[256:45.43]Next, provide a brief synopsis of the joke, including the specific times at which the recipient of the joke will laugh, and then spell out your name a second time.
[256:56.11]With these steps complete, it's time to begin the humor.
[257:00.33]Speak the entire joke in no more than 18 seconds and no less than 13 and a half, pausing only for bathroom breaks when necessary.
[257:10.13]When the joke has concluded, it is customary to inform your listener that the joke is over by declaring in your loudest possible voice, I'm done-y with the funny.
[257:21.20]Let's practice screaming, I'm done-y with the funny now.
[257:24.87]I'm not gonna do that.
[257:29.86]good this saying is a perfect example of expectations management which is the cornerstone of good comedy wasn't it finally it's time to hand out surveys collecting hard data from your audience on how rat they were throughout the joke
[257:45.13]With minus twos and plus twos.
[257:47.99]An effective survey should be no less than ten pages long and should include the same question reprinted several times, just to ensure the survey taker is actually paying attention and not simply filling in answers at random.
[258:01.18]And that's all there is.
[258:02.66]With these strategies at your disposal, you'll have audiences doubled over in laughter
[258:07.80]and even tripled over in laughter in no time at all.
[258:11.36]Just remember to let them stop laughing at some point, you gut-busting little scamp.
[258:16.82]After all, with each of us needed on the front lines of the war to fight the 12-legged invader who threatened our very existence, and to very likely die in a hailstorm of bullets and mandibles, all of us must be prepared to give our lives to this noble cause, just as our children must do after us, and their children after them.
[258:36.04]Godspeed, and may Earth reign supreme.
[258:43.25]Does it change?
[258:43.85]I hope it does.
[258:44.83]That'd be funny if it changed.
[259:14.25]Does he start talking in like a funny voice?
[259:25.44]Talk in a funny voice, please.
[259:30.57]I'm done-y with the funny.
[260:01.77]I think a little higher.
[260:03.70]I think a little bit higher.
[260:05.40]You actually nailed it with the higher, kind of more nasally approach.
[260:09.48]I think that was actually funny because a bucket... I would add an echo to your voice too.
[260:13.42]Just a slight one.
[260:14.78]Just like a little small one like this.
[260:19.42]And talk.
[260:20.74]Kind of with a higher voice.
[260:22.77]And maybe have, like, sort of a New York accent.
[260:25.31]I think that might be kind of fucking funny, too.
[260:27.81]A New York accent and kind of a high, echoey voice.
[260:30.67]I think would nail it.
[260:34.81]And be crass, too.
[260:35.93]Be crass.
[260:36.79]Say some swears.
[260:38.86]It's a bucket.
[260:39.54]It sees, like, paint and slop and dirt.
[260:42.90]It would be a little crass.
[260:43.92]Be crass.
[260:44.68]Go fun with it.
[260:45.88]Have fun with it.
[261:10.32]Is the joke over yet?
[261:11.10]I'm not conforming to that.
[261:19.67]Here we go.
[261:20.55]You ready?
[261:21.77]When Stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors, they entered the door on the left.
[261:32.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[261:33.79]You were supposed to go through the door on the right.
[261:35.87]What?
[261:36.13]Leading back to the phone.
[261:37.38]What the fuck?
[261:37.98]I did not even look at the instructional video.
[261:40.06]I think this is all covered very clearly.
[261:42.26]No, but I... There's no way I can make the comedic timing work now.
[261:45.44]It's done.
[261:46.14]What?
[261:46.24]The joke is completely done and over.
[261:48.15]It's all your fault, Stanley.
[261:51.27]I'm going to be ridiculed in the community of other joke writers.
[261:54.33]I'm going to be shamed at every one of our meetings from now on.
[261:57.85]All because you couldn't watch a simple video and take a hint.
[262:01.02]Are you proud of yourself for bringing me down, Stanley?
[262:03.46]Are you proud?
[262:06.40]What the hell happened?
[262:07.88]Okay.
[262:09.16]When Stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors, they entered the door on the left.
[262:19.38]There you go.
[262:21.56]Alright, let's see it.
[262:23.73]We're back at the phone already.
[262:25.23]No, no, no.
[262:26.33]What's going on?
[262:27.01]There was supposed to be several rooms leading up to this.
[262:29.53]It's called improv.
[262:30.21]Figure it out.
[262:30.57]There was supposed to be a build-up to this point.
[262:32.83]A dramatic display of remarkable comedic wit.
[262:35.77]You've got to be ready for anything.
[262:38.48]But now the timing's completely off.
[262:41.08]Hmm.
[262:41.32]Welp.
[263:03.33]I think I need to go back and rewatch that instructional video again.
[263:07.87]Yes, surely that will help me improve my... Stanley, you love the bucket so much it's like you... It's as though all of your other most prized possessions pale in comparison.
[263:24.32]Yes.
[263:25.54]Let me try that again, Stanley.
[263:28.61]I heard that you are pale with shame over how unabashedly in love with a bucket you are.
[263:34.77]No?
[263:35.95]Where the hell am I?
[263:37.19]Is it the delivery?
[263:38.77]Pale with shame?
[263:40.45]Pale with shame?
[263:41.39]Pale...
[263:44.05]What's another word to describe a bucket?
[263:46.37]Stanley, this bucket is so metal.
[263:48.71]I think I saw it playing guitar.
[263:51.37]No, no, no, no, no.
[263:53.14]You don't need to tell a joke.
[263:54.52]Stanley's obsession with the bucket, which was the whole point of this.
[263:57.60]I'm just, I'm no good at these jokes.
[264:01.10]I need more instructional videos.
[264:03.16]That's exactly what will make me the king of comedy again.
[264:07.45]More instructional videos.
[264:09.79]Let's see.
[264:13.26]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[264:15.80]Unfortunate.
[264:21.92]So I never got the normal ending.
[264:23.66]Somebody said that's the normal ending.
[264:24.89]I got the bucket normal ending.
[264:44.89]Fucking come on!
[265:14.16]Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left.
[265:21.57]So I did the right.
[265:22.63]I didn't do... I want to go left.
[265:26.95]Oh, the collectible.
[265:28.55]Shoot.
[265:28.87]I'll get it after.
[265:31.33]I'll get it after.
[265:36.32]How can we find them?
[265:38.00]Trust the completionist instinct.
[265:41.37]You must find them.
[265:43.13]It will be a reward for finding them all.
[265:45.75]While floating objects have appeared across the office, we have to synergize our resources to ensure their retrieval.
[265:50.65]There are many questions.
[265:52.38]How can you tell you've spotted one?
[265:53.74]What makes them float in the air?
[265:54.90]Who took these pictures of them?
[266:03.14]Follow clues provided by employee 416.
[266:05.38]We can do it.
[266:06.05]Red room.
[266:10.19]I get the hiccups.
[266:12.79]Good luck.
[266:13.11]Alright, I gotta go to the red room.
[266:18.88]Large, ooh.
[266:23.34]A large room, lots of boxes.
[266:24.62]Stairs, something to do with stairs.
[266:26.46]Somewhere both red and blue.
[266:34.07]No!
[266:36.89]I know where those are.
[266:40.81]Stanley, we must move on from this broom closet, simply because I have no remaining stickers.
[266:46.39]If I did, you can guarantee we'd be in here for hours.
[266:50.33]But alas, no stickers.
[267:00.41]Coming to a staircase, Stanley and the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office.
[267:11.37]Up or down?
[267:11.79]I think I did up already.
[267:20.37]Ooh!
[267:20.57]I'm going back to the name of these little Stanley figurines.
[267:24.08]And now I'm torn between Stanlerines and Figlies.
[267:27.96]What do you think, Stanley?
[267:29.44]What name better encapsulates the intrinsic sense of happiness that you get from seeing a small number in the corner of your screen go up by one?
[267:37.49]Let me sit on it.
[267:38.77]I'm sure it will come to me.
[267:45.87]Wait, this is the floating ending.
[267:48.37]He considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.
[267:53.65]He might be fired for that.
[267:54.75]Do I get a different bucket ending?
[267:57.15]Why had he taken that risk?
[267:59.25]All because he believed everyone had vanished?
[268:01.79]His boss would think he was crazy.
[268:03.93]And then, something occurred to Stanley.
[268:06.63]I have my bucket.
[268:07.33]Maybe, he thought to himself, maybe I am crazy.
[268:12.09]Am I crazy?
[268:14.68]He asked the bucket.
[268:16.00]The bucket returned his gaze, but said nothing at all.
[268:19.54]That's strange, Stanley thought.
[268:21.10]Usually the bucket is a source of guidance and wisdom for me in difficult times such as these.
[268:26.84]He held the bucket close, yet felt none of its familiar reassurance and comfort.
[268:31.85]Floating.
[268:32.05]What?
[268:32.17]I got the stickers on it.
[268:33.37]Hey!
[268:33.77]Why did it go away?
[268:54.77]now he noticed that the rooms were repeating which was of course very odd and now he felt himself floating off the ground what the hell gracious what the hell without my bucket I've gone truly mad where is it I must find it far off in the distance now he heard it calling to him Stanley Stanley it's me the bucket
[269:17.27]Where are you?
[269:18.75]He rushed forward from room to room, passing by one bucket after the next.
[269:22.31]Oh shit.
[269:22.54]None of them were his.
[269:23.72]None of them were his special bucket.
[269:25.66]Why?
[269:26.04]Come to me, Stanley.
[269:28.12]Find me.
[269:29.85]He had to find the bucket.
[269:31.27]He had to return to his old friend.
[269:32.83]It was the only way to truly restore his sanity.
[269:35.51]And then suddenly, he froze dead in his tracks.
[269:38.89]He knew where the voice of the bucket had been coming from.
[269:42.39]The real bucket was inside of him all along.
[269:46.72]It was incredibly painful.
[269:49.14]Stanley doubled over in agony and blacked out.
[269:58.11]This is the story of a woman named Mariela.
[270:00.23]I still die?
[270:00.85]I actually still die.
[270:04.55]Mariela woke up on a day like any other.
[270:06.63]Is the bucket in the scene?
[270:07.43]She arose, got dressed, picked up her bucket of comfort and security, and walked to her place of work.
[270:13.90]But on this particular day, her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who had stumbled through town, talking and screaming to himself, and then collapsed dead on the sidewalk.
[270:24.07]right away she knew what the problem he didn't have a bucket this man had no bucket right of course he'd gone mad ranting and raving about a narrator describing all of his actions and how everything is predetermined and free will is an illusion and it's all just a video game it could all have been prevented if only he'd taken his bucket with him perhaps he didn't even realize he'd forgotten his bucket at home in the first place
[270:50.41]How cruel the world can be, Mariela thought, and she hugged her own bucket even tighter.
[270:56.55]But of course, she had no time for this.
[270:58.91]There were a myriad of confusing problems she would soon have to confront at work, for which her bucket would provide absolute guidance and total clarity on everything.
[271:08.36]Heck yes, she thought to herself, my life kicks ass, and she backflipped all the way to work.
[271:32.69]What am I doing?
[271:35.33]I take this fucking thing everywhere.
[271:38.69]Everywhere.
[271:48.17]I take it to work.
[271:49.27]I take it to store.
[271:51.37]I constantly have it right here.
[271:55.24]I take it everywhere.
[271:58.14]Something that got in my mouth.
[271:59.38]And it was not even that bad because it's not even a big deal.
[272:01.66]It's just like fucking whatever it is.
[272:03.54]What is chapstick made out of?
[272:08.42]Hellanthus anus.
[272:11.35]Sunflower seed oil.
[272:14.29]Coconut oil.
[272:15.41]Beeswax.
[272:18.31]Castor seed oil.
[272:20.47]Aroma.
[272:23.31]Shea butter.
[272:26.33]Cocoa butter.
[272:28.83]Strawberry seed oil.
[272:29.85]Some kind of soybean glycerin or something.
[272:34.89]Oil.
[272:39.23]Geranio.
[272:41.95]And natural flavor.
[272:47.37]Now this is content.
[272:48.45]Thank you.
[272:49.23]What was that?
[272:50.13]Oh.
[272:58.30]Okay, now I'm going to go get the one that's in the big room.
[273:01.56]The big room.
[273:02.02]Then I'll need one more after that.
[273:03.48]Where's my bucket?
[273:04.40]Where's my bucket?
[273:04.86]I don't have my bucket anymore.
[273:16.33]Where's my bucket?
[273:16.95]I missed- I didn't take- I didn't pick the bucket up.
[273:21.45]I fucked it all up.
[273:22.40]No I didn't.
[273:22.66]I'm gonna get- I'll be alright.
[273:24.26]I'll jump off.
[273:44.15]you're getting one more now Stanley you've nearly gotten all of the figla and marines very soon you'll collect the last one and then the first number will equal the second number and that will be it we'll be different people by then different in the sense that we used to have none of them sad we have them all you can't go back to when you had no figla and marines none of us can
[274:11.72]But in his eagerness to prove that he is in control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do, Stanley left from the platform and plunged to his death.
[274:21.01]Good job, Stanley.
[274:22.49]Everyone thinks you are very powerful.
[274:24.46]Give me my bucket.
[274:28.83]all of his co-workers were gone where's this last one Stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply the good old bucket just Stanley in the bucket off on another thrilling adventure together
[274:45.20]Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left.
[274:50.88]Nope.
[274:51.18]This was not the correct way to the meeting room.
[274:53.71]Nope.
[274:53.93]Stanley had felt the bucket calling to him, telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be.
[275:01.65]And here it was.
[275:02.77]Had the bucket turned out to be correct?
[275:04.71]Was it a... Never mind.
[275:06.91]The bucket was wrong.
[275:08.03]No, the bucket wasn't wrong.
[275:09.65]We're going the right way.
[275:11.21]Back to the meeting room.
[275:13.90]Because I'm doing this.
[275:14.82]Okay.
[275:15.52]What's down here?
[275:45.47]Cassette tapes.
[275:46.87]Oh, narrator dialogue.
[275:48.21]Narrator dialogue.
[275:50.40]Oh, we're going to meet the narrator.
[276:06.25]Okay.
[276:07.19]This is day number 295.
[276:08.23]Take number... I don't even know.
[276:14.99]I've lost track.
[276:17.77]Nothing feels real anymore.
[276:20.58]Wait, is this supposed to be the narrator when he was young?
[276:23.06]I study this bucket.
[276:26.04]The less sense anything makes.
[276:29.98]This is me talking?
[276:31.68]The sheer euphoria I feel every time I pick it up.
[276:38.52]This is Dark Souls dialogue.
[276:39.92]No matter how many times I've done it, it's always the same feeling.
[276:48.08]And the emptiness in my chest when I set it down.
[276:54.67]It doesn't make sense.
[276:58.15]There's no explanation for it.
[277:02.55]I still haven't figured out why I see the world so differently when this bucket is in my arms.
[277:13.22]Why everything feels so... What do I do with this treasure?
[277:25.13]I can monetize it.
[277:28.15]Yes.
[277:30.83]It's unthinkable the amounts of money people will pay for just an hour with the bucket.
[277:40.27]This is my golden ticket.
[277:44.20]But I have to be careful because as soon as this gets out, there's going to be a target on my back.
[277:51.12]Even now, I don't know who I'll be trying to get.
[277:56.02]What's that?
[277:57.98]Who's there?
[278:10.79]Last Harry Potter.
[278:21.50]You just ruin the moment.
[278:26.54]I have to hear it.
[278:27.82]I keep fucking thinking about it.
[278:32.24]I can't stop thinking about it, dude.
[278:34.03]I really fucking can't.
[278:35.15]I promise.
[278:35.79]I can't stop thinking about this.
[279:30.44]Okay, we're good.
[279:31.33]I just need to hear it every like four or five days.
[279:33.65]I just need to hear it every four or five days.
[279:36.09]That's it.
[279:44.45]What happened this is different All of his co-workers were gone what could it mean what decided to go to the meeting room perhaps He had simply missed a memo
[279:58.37]Where are we going today?
[279:59.89]The bucket asked.
[280:01.05]Stanley just smiled.
[280:03.14]Anywhere they went together would be... Stanley pressed the bucket upon every little thing in the office.
[280:08.36]Yay!
[280:09.22]Nothing responded to the bucket's touch.
[280:11.52]But it did little to discourage Stanley's belief in the magic of the bucket.
[280:18.55]The whiteboard ending.
[280:19.89]Dog mode?
[280:34.58]Did I ever tell you about the dog sound like Christmas album?
[280:40.69]Where it's like the jingle bells and shit.
[280:42.83]They don't sell them anymore.
[280:44.53]They don't make them anymore.
[280:52.24]They don't make it anymore.
[280:57.04]I used to fucking cry laughing at that shit.
[280:59.46]It was so stupid.
[281:00.64]We wish you a Merry Christmas barking dog Christmas song.
[281:04.32]Wait, you found it already?
[281:06.10]Do they still exist?
[281:27.45]OK, what is this?
[281:30.39]This is Jingle Bells.
[282:09.46]I'm serious if you want to win a you laugh you lose challenge or like a no emotion challenge play this for somebody and they're gonna be like just what the fuck man like it's too much it's just stupid I'll try I'll try it
[283:01.01]That one was not even funny.
[283:03.02]The dogs aren't even there anymore!
[283:06.80]Wait, what?! !
[283:21.56]Where do they go?
[283:23.97]Why are they not here?
[283:27.77]Okay, there they are.
[283:29.65]Okay.
[283:31.43]Listen to the cat ones.
[284:01.51]Alright, this is the last one and I'm done.
[284:37.94]I want to like put this up.
[284:39.94]I want to go to like a big Christmas party and just put this on.
[284:43.54]It's just, it's, it's just so different.
[284:45.70]It's just so odd.
[284:46.58]The people would be like sitting there drinking their drinks and like, it's not the typical just shit that's on the radio.
[284:51.67]It'd be like, what the fuck is this?
[284:55.83]Like, this is kind of weird.
[284:58.65]No, it's a 10 hour version guys.
[285:00.11]I'm not going to let it play the whole time.
[285:07.28]We lost like 300 viewers.
[285:08.04]Damages.
[285:08.24]Let's go!
[285:11.15]Alright, so what was I gonna do?
[285:17.75]It was more like 4,000.
[285:18.31]Oops.
[285:37.11]Alright, we need to go left, and then we need to go... ...somewhere else.
[285:45.98]I wanna find that- Oh, that just scared the shit out of me.
[285:48.57]Okay, somewhere both red and blue.
[286:01.34]Okay, I'm going to go up.
[286:02.82]No, no, no.
[286:03.16]Where do I go?
[286:04.08]Up.
[286:04.24]No.
[286:04.60]Where should I go from here?
[286:05.70]It is up, isn't it?
[286:28.70]I need a red and blue door.
[286:30.36]Because the boss knows that what the boss says goes, if the boss has suffered losses, then that's what the boss chose.
[286:37.26]Oh, shut the f*** up.
[286:47.72]Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.
[286:54.86]Two, what is it?
[286:56.38]Two, eight.
[286:57.52]Two, eight, four, five.
[287:00.90]But Stanley guessed the correct code by sheer luck.
[287:04.83]Was it that the bucket knew all along?
[287:07.19]Was the bucket guiding him?
[287:08.81]No, it was the dog.
[287:09.61]Right, dog?
[287:10.41]This is certainly the most logical explanation.
[287:13.29]Right.
[287:13.91]Dog, you have the floor.
[287:15.35]Whatever you'd like to say about what just happened.
[287:23.21]up.
[287:23.39]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[287:25.10]What the fuck?
[287:30.34]What the fuck, dude?
[287:34.08]I gave you the fucking floor and... Jesus.
[287:47.57]That was actually fucked.
[287:48.47]I'm not letting the dog talk again.
[287:50.43]That's fucked up.
[287:53.06]Oh, man.
[287:53.54]Ooh, I can do this one, right?
[288:08.72]I haven't done this one with a bucket.
[288:12.68]The truth was that at the end of this hall, Stanley and the bucket would both meet a violent death.
[288:19.22]Where do I find the red and the blue door next to each other?
[288:21.93]The door behind them was not shut.
[288:24.13]Stanley and the bucket still had every opportunity to turn around and get back on track.
[288:32.34]At this point, Stanley and the bucket were knowingly walking forward into a very painful death for each of them.
[289:01.72]So now what happens if I have the bucket?
[289:06.53]We gonna do infomercials tonight?
[289:07.78]The plan is to do infomercials tomorrow.
[289:12.26]As the machine whirred into motion and Stanley and the bucket inched closer to their demise, Stanley reflected on how meaningless the bucket's warmth and comfort had turned out to be.
[289:22.10]To be sure, it puts the mind and the soul... Can I stop it with the bucket?
[289:25.16]...to embrace the bucket.
[289:26.22]But what use is a sense of ease when you're about to be crushed to death?
[289:30.47]This is what Stanley thought to himself, and he sort of kicked himself for wasting so much time carrying a bucket everywhere.
[289:37.57]Farewell, Stanley.
[289:44.51]Farewell, Stanley, cried the narrator.
[289:46.77]Who is this person?
[289:47.55]Stanley and the bucket were led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws in a single visceral instant.
[289:54.95]The bucket's life came to an end as it was crushed violently to death.
[290:09.59]What the fuck?
[290:10.19]The bucket.
[290:10.86]Welcomes you to the grand exhibit.
[290:12.36]Okay.
[290:44.07]Um, alright.
[291:12.90]Bucket with two handles.
[291:14.58]This bucket is depicted as having two handles.
[291:17.34]Such a design has never been created in real life.
[291:19.63]Having been deemed too dangerous and recklessly experimental.
[291:23.89]Every year, dozens are put to death just for attempting it.
[291:31.68]Word?
[291:32.54]The fuck?
[291:34.62]The inferno bucket.
[291:37.03]A replica of the Inferno bucket, which in the medieval era was so powerfully alluring that it drove dozens of nations to war with one another for control of it.
[291:44.82]Billions died, and yet in spite of it all, the simple fact remains, no one can control a bucket.
[291:49.40]Okay.
[291:54.57]What the f- Cave drawing.
[292:06.12]While we know that buckets predate the existence of mankind, we do not know by how long.
[292:11.64]This cave drawing depicts early man's discovery of the practical uses of the bucket, by which time the bucket had already likely been around for several Malenia.
[292:19.79]Notice in these drawings how the bucket is allowing itself to be used, having judged humanity to be worthy of its treasures.
[292:34.14]no man can own a bucket and certainly not a bucket as dazzling to behold as this one it is man who should kneel before the bucket the hanging bucket this piece symbolizes the necessary relationship between bucket and humanity however clear our grasp of the bucket may be there is yet more that is always out of reach this distance inevitably is for our own good
[293:05.01]What the?
[293:06.63]I got it.
[293:11.52]But there is something we can do.
[293:13.86]Something we can do together, you and I, that will right this terrible wrong.
[293:21.40]Let Stanley die.
[293:23.36]Let him be crushed by the machine.
[293:25.52]Don't reset the game.
[293:27.16]Don't give him another opportunity to run off with another beautiful bucket.
[293:31.13]We can save the world's buckets from their treatment as tools and implements if only we let Stanley die together.
[293:37.11]The bucket shall take its place as ruler, as leader, as commander of a new world, a new vision.
[294:01.93]I can't wait to tell this story to my co-workers Stanley thought how amusing they'll find it oh won't we all just laugh and laugh at the time I thought everyone had gone missing no matter how hard Stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers
[294:32.57]Alright, I want to get that last one.
[294:34.25]I want to get the last, um... It's this way, and then on the catwalk, right?
[294:36.31]I think it's, yeah, I got to go to... I guess if we get the two doors.
[294:38.26]Am I going to get the true ending if I get all the bobblehead things?
[295:00.30]Stanley was so bad at following directions, it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago.
[295:07.29]Look, Stanley, I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.
[295:10.55]What about the bucket?
[295:11.23]I'm not sure.
[295:11.75]I don't want it.
[295:12.21]No, really, I'm not.
[295:13.07]It sucks.
[295:13.77]I realize that investing your trust in someone else can be difficult, but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time.
[295:23.18]There's someone you've been neglecting, Stanley.
[295:26.14]Someone you've forgotten.
[295:27.82]Okay.
[295:28.32]Here we go.
[295:28.98]Okay.
[295:29.10]Okay.
[295:49.85]My eye.
[295:50.67]Okay, so both red and blue.
[295:53.09]Stanley walked through the red door.
[295:55.39]Got them all.
[295:56.55]The last Stiggly Wiggly.
[295:58.73]Savor this moment, Stanley.
[296:00.25]This is a real accomplishment.
[296:02.61]This is doing something just for the sake of doing it.
[296:05.82]Where so many people expect to be rewarded for the most trivial achievements, you've insisted that a job well done is its own reward.
[296:14.96]I would tell you that I'm proud of you for collecting them all.
[296:18.02]But that would be like a reward.
[296:19.92]And we can't have that.
[296:21.20]So, instead I'll just say, it's done.
[296:24.10]We're all done here.
[296:25.51]And now we can go to whatever the hell you were doing before you hunted for figurines.
[296:29.73]What?
[296:34.35]Okay.
[296:36.95]Let's go on the blue door.
[296:38.27]I just have to go to... Perhaps you misunderstood.
[296:41.20]Stanley walked through the red door.
[296:47.06]Oh, thank God you are willing to listen to me.
[296:49.70]Do you see that I really have wanted you to be happy all this time?
[296:53.80]The problem is all these choices.
[296:55.84]Reset.
[296:56.82]Reset.
[296:58.82]Just begin the game again?
[296:59.74]Just reset?
[297:01.72]Do I win?
[297:03.64]Did I win?
[297:14.43]Should I go back to The Stanley Parable 2 area?
[297:16.48]Is that a better idea?
[297:22.80]Um... Stanley, I'm sorry, but I have to put a pause on things.
[297:28.00]It's just... It's those figurines.
[297:30.56]Those figlies.
[297:31.90]I haven't stopped thinking about them since you nabbed every last one.
[297:35.94]Wasn't it just the most intrinsically fulfilling moment of your entire life?
[297:40.41]Didn't it fill you to the brim with inner richness?
[297:43.82]Yes, I know we're supposed to be telling a story.
[297:45.96]He's up there.
[297:46.32]But won't you please indulge me with one more trip back to the memory zone?
[297:50.32]Okay.
[297:50.88]I would love nothing more than to revisit the figurines.
[297:54.38]Just one more time.
[297:59.74]I wish there was a burp mode where I could be like... Now remembering when Stanley found the collectibles.
[298:26.10]Okay.
[298:29.52]Remember this, 2013.
[298:38.47]Stanley Power Bowl.
[298:41.03]Stanley Power Bowl.
[298:42.89]Stanley Power Bowl is an Explosions story game of his choice.
[298:49.28]What's it say?
[298:50.48]Audience Award, Stanley Power Bowl.
[298:53.10]Alright, I've already seen this.
[298:58.60]Wait.
[299:03.99]Here's where it all began.
[299:05.93]The first collectible.
[299:07.87]Oh, right.
[299:08.59]No idea of how many of them we'd find.
[299:10.75]Sure, it's at six right there on the screen.
[299:12.79]But how could we know for certain we were so innocent?
[299:16.96]We'll never be like that again, Stanley.
[299:23.22]Are there any more?
[299:23.80]This one right here.
[299:28.69]It was definitely a trick.
[299:49.11]It was a trick.
[299:49.51]Seven.
[299:50.21]Am I actually... Did I just like get... Am I screwed?
[300:19.46]Can I go back through that?
[300:20.24]I think it was under the stairs.
[300:25.31]It was under the stairs.
[300:26.75]You're fine.
[300:27.25]You don't need to.
[300:28.41]Okay.
[300:28.57]It was under the stairs.
[300:29.81]Yeah, it was.
[300:30.31]What do you mean, no?
[300:31.57]Yeah, it was.
[300:33.25]It was under the stairs.
[300:33.91]That was the fourth one?
[300:49.06]Are you sure?
[300:50.38]Was it the office?
[300:51.22]Don't lie to me.
[300:51.82]Is it wrong?
[301:01.68]hey that's exactly right it was here behind the boss's office it was the third one you picked it up and then after that you had three of them I'm glad these moments are so crystal clear in your memory but I shouldn't be surprised after all science tells us that it's impossible to forget your third time doing anything okay keep going let's see what came next
[301:34.10]Okay.
[301:34.24]Definitely wasn't here unless this is somewhere else.
[301:37.18]Any of the doors open?
[301:37.70]No.
[301:37.78]What is this?
[302:08.72]This was the fifth mini-stand, and this one was really something special.
[302:12.82]It was in the warehouse.
[302:14.42]I remember it so clearly.
[302:16.57]In fact, because this one is particularly special to me, I made a little video to commemorate the occasion.
[302:23.47]Enjoy.
[302:28.27]Windows Movie Maker?
[302:55.75]You found it near the cargo lift.
[303:11.87]Takes you back, doesn't it?
[303:12.77]I spent a lot of time making that video, but it was eight minutes I wouldn't have spent on anything else.
[303:19.01]Okay.
[303:21.34]I can go down there.
[303:22.14]Can I make it?
[303:26.45]Wait, I can go down there.
[303:30.39]Will I die if I fall here?
[303:32.17]I can go through, look, dock B. Well, like 2006.
[303:35.09]Yeah.
[303:35.61]I think I'm dead if I do that.
[303:41.70]Looks like I can go over there, though.
[303:50.50]Back here again.
[303:52.88]And then, Stanley, then we came to the last collectible, the final figurine, right here by the red and blue doors.
[303:59.31]This memory is the most distinct and clear in my mind, perhaps because it was the one that happened more recently than all the others.
[304:06.67]Who can truly say how the mind works?
[304:09.67]All I know is that this is the moment where you picked up a figly and I thought to myself, yes, that's all of them.
[304:16.20]They're all collected.
[304:18.08]It was a moment unlike any other.
[304:21.36]Except for the other moments picking up figurines, which it was exactly like.
[304:35.33]What are you doing?
[304:35.95]I'm being a bird.
[304:38.73]Uh, does it matter which one I go in?
[304:39.77]No.
[304:48.45]You are in the present.
[304:53.64]And then there was no more.
[304:55.84]Because we've caught up to the present moment.
[304:58.62]Nothing left to do but move onward into the future.
[305:02.04]Goodbye, memory zone.
[305:03.50]Hey.
[305:08.02]LOL, just checking.
[305:10.02]No, no, no, I'm not done.
[305:11.84]I'm not ready to move on.
[305:13.46]Stop the loading screen.
[305:14.98]Isn't there some way we can stay here, keep enjoying these figurines?
[305:18.40]Let's just go backwards.
[305:20.30]We'll do the memory zone again from the opposite direction.
[305:22.79]See how that feels.
[305:24.43]Oh my god, okay.
[305:26.51]Can I, like, turn the TV off or something?
[305:28.05]Unplug it?
[305:30.05]I have to go through and do all that again?
[305:32.11]Backwards?
[305:36.46]Oh god, okay, whatever.
[305:40.17]Came through here.
[305:40.93]It's right around the left.
[305:41.83]There's the first one.
[305:42.53]Uh-huh.
[305:42.73]Okay.
[305:42.83]Weirdo.
[306:04.41]And here's where I made that video.
[306:06.39]Don't you remember the video we watched?
[306:08.23]Don't watch it again.
[306:09.29]Oh my fucking god.
[306:14.25]Yes, I love that video.
[306:15.69]That was a great video.
[306:18.20]It only has 600 thumbs down and 2 thumbs up.
[306:22.68]You're doing great.
[306:24.42]It's a great video.
[306:31.49]Still don't remember the pink room, Stanley.
[306:33.68]Still no memory of this one.
[306:35.20]Good room though.
[306:36.20]A solid room.
[306:36.92]It's a pretty solid room.
[306:40.98]I enjoy it.
[306:43.60]These really were a treat to hunt down.
[306:45.52]You know, if there had been any kind of reward for finding all of these, it really would have neutered the intrinsic joy of collecting them.
[306:52.99]I'm very glad we resisted the temptation.
[306:55.97]Next one.
[306:59.67]I wonder what my most disliked video was.
[307:06.76]What was it?
[307:10.46]What is it my most disliked?
[307:11.58]No, it wasn't Smite.
[307:12.34]Should I go under the stairs?
[307:27.59]The Dark Souls one?
[307:29.21]I don't think so.
[307:31.37]It was Demon Lord at Freddy's.
[307:32.75]You know what?
[307:33.27]That actually might be it.
[307:36.13]That actually might be it.
[307:37.15]Yeah.
[307:37.37]Yeah, okay.
[307:37.65]It's because people thought that was, first of all, not funny.
[307:40.00]And second of all, people hated Five Nights at Freddy's.
[307:57.20]I remember that.
[307:58.48]Yep, I remember uploading that video and that was right in the middle of Five Nights at Freddy's was getting popular and people, like, hated it.
[308:04.71]And I was doing, like, this demon, like, avatar thing and people didn't think it was funny, so it was a double whammy.
[308:20.55]Oh, there's this one.
[308:21.84]No.
[308:21.96]The Big Bang.
[308:22.36]I fucking hate Demon Lord Zoraxos.
[308:23.64]That's fair.
[308:24.14]Collect them all.
[308:57.61]I don't agree with you, but it's fair.
[309:07.47]Look, it's the terrible new content that we were originally sold on.
[309:12.04]I remember hating it back then.
[309:13.94]But time does put a rosy filter on everything.
[309:17.08]In fact, I dare say I'm actually quite fond of it now.
[309:20.50]Five Nights at Freddy's now is more popular now than it ever was.
[309:28.62]Interesting.
[309:41.96]That video made the game popular.
[309:43.62]No, it did not.
[309:51.55]That was one of the least viewed videos on my channel, and I was at the tail end of that game's initial first Five Nights at Freddy's 1 popularity.
[310:01.67]I was like four months late to the party, and I tried to do like a fun little spin on it, and I was way too late.
[310:12.38]Way too late.
[310:16.42]If anything, that video made people dislike the game more.
[310:20.35]And me and me too.
[310:24.29]And before everything else, there was your office.
[310:29.17]There are probably people from like 2012, 2013.
[310:33.84]There's something I feel I can remember.
[310:35.68]I can remember who left in rage and never came back from that video.
[310:41.94]Yes, I'm remembering something now.
[310:44.76]I remember before this whole story got started.
[310:47.67]Back then, I was... I was different.
[310:50.65]I used to make big decisions.
[310:52.33]I was passionate.
[310:53.33]I was skeptical.
[310:54.35]I weighed each decision with profound thoughtfulness.
[310:58.09]And then, somewhere along the way, I stopped making decisions.
[311:02.29]I became lazy, and I came up with... well, came up with a character named Stanley to do my thinking for me.
[311:08.80]He would make the decisions.
[311:09.92]He would decide which way to go.
[311:11.40]I would cheer him on as he collected figurines for no reason.
[311:15.72]Why did I invent Stanley?
[311:17.84]Was I lonely?
[311:19.10]Yes, perhaps that's it.
[311:20.48]Perhaps I needed to imagine I had companionship.
[311:23.84]And Stanley really did make for a wonderful companion, even if he was a fiction.
[311:29.02]But I suppose it's grown old.
[311:31.96]I want to think for myself again.
[311:33.40]I want to go back to how it used to be.
[311:36.60]Yes, I can be on my own again.
[311:39.19]I can do it.
[311:40.97]I'll be stronger this time.
[311:42.53]I'll take care of myself.
[311:44.39]I don't need Stanley anymore.
[311:46.61]Oh, but he truly was so much fun to play with.
[311:50.37]You know what?
[311:51.53]Since we're in the memory zone, how about one more good memory?
[311:55.63]Let's go back just once and give Stanley one more run of the office.
[312:00.05]One more go?
[312:00.68]I'll retire him for good.
[312:02.86]I did enjoy telling his story so very much.
[312:06.56]okay here we go this is the story of a man named Stanley one more I get one more go I gotta make this count wait Stanley thought to himself am I sure that the orders stopped coming in how is that possible they never stopped surely I was mistaken
[312:36.17]This is it.
[312:37.13]Okay, last run.
[312:39.04]The end is never the end.
[312:40.00]The end is never the end.
[312:40.92]The end is never the end.
[312:41.80]The end is never the end.
[312:42.72]The end is never the end.
[312:46.02]I need to make Stanley happy.
[312:49.36]With the bucket, of course.
[312:50.67]A good bucket.
[312:51.85]A strong bucket.
[312:52.85]A humble bucket.
[312:54.09]A committed bucket.
[312:55.31]A bucket of culture and distinction.
[313:03.78]Which way do I go?
[313:04.24]How should I end it?
[313:04.72]Just make him happy?
[313:25.77]Still no one was here.
[313:27.66]Stanley needed the bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever.
[313:31.34]Perhaps his boss's office was where he'd find answers.
[313:34.90]Reboot the game entirely.
[313:36.34]Did I?
[314:00.13]I just quit the game.
[314:05.76]Okay.
[314:08.59]Rebooting.
[314:29.67]Please enter the current time.
[314:30.63]9.15 PM.
[314:43.41]Hang on, hang on.
[314:47.39]Before we get started, can I just say something?
[314:49.81]Thank you for actually setting the clock both times you booted up the game.
[314:52.81]A lot of people don't take that step seriously.
[314:56.01]Just leave the clock set at 12 and call it a day.
[314:59.58]But you're actually taking the time to set the clock, and I appreciate that.
[315:02.58]That's how I know that you care about the experience, that you're paying attention.
[315:06.83]I don't even have any way of knowing if the times you're setting are correct.
[315:10.29]Tell you what, I'll make you a deal.
[315:14.01]Since you've been so cooperative, next time you boot up the game and see this screen, just set the clock to your favorite time.
[315:20.55]Pick whatever time you want, even if it's not the correct time.
[315:22.58]You've earned it.
[315:22.96]Alright, back to the video game.
[315:28.04]10 o'clock.
[315:31.31]10 p.m.
[315:31.55]10 p.m.
[315:34.43]is my favorite time.
[315:35.94]Not too late, not too early.
[315:37.12]There's still probably a couple, two or three hours left in the night.
[315:40.04]Relaxing.
[315:41.18]Reboot it again.
[315:47.00]Again?
[315:47.24]Okay.
[315:54.33]I'm going to say, no, you know what?
[315:55.99]9.30 is probably my favorite time.
[315:58.40]When I look at the clock and I see it's 9.30, I'm like, alright, there's still the whole night is there.
[316:03.21]I'm relaxing, I'm cool, I'm good.
[316:06.39]It's at least probably three to five hours before I'm even going to think about sleep.
[316:09.23]Okay, current time.
[316:11.71]They said I can make it whatever I want.
[316:14.55]9.30 is the best time.
[316:15.51]9.30 p.m.
[316:25.15]Not that far from now.
[316:27.24]That's my favorite time.
[316:29.47]Or could you simply not resist giving me the correct time again?
[316:31.69]No, that's 15 minutes from now.
[316:35.52]After all, I know how much you enjoy setting the time correctly.
[316:38.96]And now I'm curious how accurate 9.30pm is.
[316:41.14]Let's use another slider to find out.
[316:45.16]How accurate is 9.30pm?
[316:49.29]I would say that's very, very close.
[316:53.91]That's, like, incredibly close.
[316:57.59]Right?
[316:57.81]I mean, that's in literally, like, 13 minutes.
[317:04.60]You know, can I just say, in regards to the accuracy of the clock, I'm having a great time adjusting these settings.
[317:08.47]I feel like I'm learning more about you.
[317:11.35]Now, you like things to be set.
[317:14.15]It's good to collect data.
[317:16.29]Okay.
[317:51.76]Stop rebooting, it's terrifying.
[317:53.34]Okay.
[318:01.41]Please adjust the slider until the computer is barely visible.
[318:07.46]I like it.
[318:08.06]This is brightness.
[318:11.68]Please adjust the slider until the dog and cat are friends.
[318:27.44]I'd say right about there.
[318:28.96]Right there.
[318:29.34]Please just ladder until the number five becomes the number nine.
[318:42.13]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[318:47.61]Nine.
[318:47.87]Nine.
[318:52.12]Nine.
[318:56.38]Well, it says becomes the number nine.
[318:58.82]Not spell it, no bullshit, no Roman numerals.
[319:02.02]The number nine, just that.
[319:03.64]That's what it's telling me to do.
[319:04.66]Adjust the slider until you stop adjusting the slider.
[319:10.02]Okay, hold on.
[319:11.28]Alright, I think maybe I can think about here.
[319:17.98]Yeah, I think so.
[319:18.94]Maybe just a little bit more.
[319:21.62]I'm not feeling it.
[319:23.14]I think it's a little bit up right here is fine.
[319:26.47]Which of the two made-up words below is most appealing to you?
[319:30.31]Scrumptish or Ocuboinkle?
[319:33.55]Oh my fucking god, Ocuboinkle a million times.
[319:38.39]Please don't adjust the slider.
[319:39.75]Okay.
[319:43.39]Do you know what time it is right now?
[319:45.09]Yes, I do.
[319:46.41]It is 9.20.
[319:46.77]Is the time that it is right now the correct time?
[319:53.50]Yes.
[319:56.24]What is it?
[319:56.76]What is time anyway?
[319:59.14]I don't know.
[319:59.70]Is there anything about yourself that you haven't told me?
[320:05.82]Yeah, shitload.
[320:06.94]You're a computer.
[320:08.68]Help.
[320:11.62]Yes.
[320:14.30]Will you come back to visit me?
[320:16.45]Yes.
[320:16.65]Okay.
[320:28.29]Okay.
[320:49.01]What time is it?
[320:51.89]Does anyone really truly know?
[320:54.61]Of course they don't.
[320:55.37]Nobody knows anything.
[320:56.79]You and I don't even know each other.
[320:58.01]We're like strangers.
[321:00.21]Sure, I've adjusted all the game settings to your exact specifications, but who hasn't?
[321:03.67]It's just what I do, like a day job.
[321:07.09]And now the job is over.
[321:09.21]There's no more information for me to gather.
[321:10.65]I've collected all the data on you that I can.
[321:13.28]I still don't really know you.
[321:15.30]You don't know me.
[321:17.48]And neither of us know what time it is.
[321:21.63]I guess some settings are just unsettable.
[321:25.00]But if I'm being totally honest, the clock doesn't do anything in the game anyways.
[321:28.69]You won't have me here when the game starts next time, but that's okay.
[321:32.67]Video games are meant to be played alone.
[321:38.30]You like being alone, don't you?
[321:40.48]That's maybe the only information that I really learned about you.
[321:43.93]Time for me to leave.
[321:45.59]There's still one more setting that we need to adjust, but it may take a little time before I'm ready for that.
[321:50.27]It's not really in my job description, but that's okay.
[321:53.03]Perhaps you'll see me again, if you can find me.
[321:55.88]Talk soon.
[322:02.74]What?
[322:05.75]Epilogue.
[322:10.75]Did I get something?
[322:13.41]I got something.
[322:21.65]I got something.
[322:23.03]Epilogue.
[322:28.71]Many, many years later.
[322:42.91]Wait, this is from the skipping.
[322:44.09]This is back when I skipped a bunch of times, alright?
[323:17.85]Okay, I guess I camped out for a night.
[323:20.05]I gotta keep going.
[323:20.63]Reminds me of Outer Wilds.
[323:56.09]To the moon.
[323:57.25]Towards the... towards the moon.
[323:59.07]Towards the moon.
[323:59.67]I'm gonna say towards the moon.
[324:01.99]Towards the moon.
[324:08.78]Towards the moon.
[324:10.08]Going... direction towards the moon.
[324:20.22]What?
[324:32.57]this is the memory zone right didn't I leave the memory zone why am I going back to the memory zone
[324:57.58]In loving memory of The Stanley Parable 2.
[325:29.62]Cookie9's blog.
[325:31.88]Review The Stanley Parable 2.
[325:34.48]Like so many, I enjoyed my time with the original Stanley Parable, which underscores how truly disappointed I am with its sequel.
[325:42.25]With a first game teamed with originality, The Stanley Parable 2 is dull, uninspired, and often insulting to its fanbase.
[325:49.47]Rather than expand on what made the first game enjoyable, the sequel veers off into territory nobody asked for.
[325:55.40]An infinitely deep hole, who cares?
[325:57.74]Where are the new endings?
[325:59.58]What about enjoyable bits from The Stanley Parable 1?
[326:02.56]Like the adventure line.
[326:04.78]Instead, we get an uninspired side quest collecting figurines.
[326:08.52]Even this diversion feels incomplete.
[326:10.99]Collecting all the figurines gives you nothing.
[326:13.13]I must say, though, I found the bucket to be quite comforting.
[326:15.35]A welcome reprieve from... From what?
[326:28.37]From what?
[326:30.04]20... 27.
[326:30.44]Is this when Stanley Parable 2 is gonna come out?
[326:55.36]Stanley Parable developers, no more spin-offs, no more sequels.
[327:00.19]When The Stanley Parable launched to massive success in 2013, its creators made plans to build the property into an entire franchise.
[327:07.09]But a disastrous critical and commercial reception for The Stanley Parable 2 has prompted the developers to rethink their ambitions, as outlined in a press release they published today.
[327:16.05]It's clear that more Stanley Parable is not what the fans want.
[327:23.06]We thought that we had a vision for the series that players would be excited about, yet it turns out this could not have been further from the truth.
[327:29.76]Press release goes on to promise to preserve the artistic integrity of the original game and to stop assaulting fans with our reckless and insulting creative visions.
[327:37.88]The word sorry appears more than 25 times in the press release.
[327:44.94]Get on the green.
[327:45.62]Jim.
[328:10.92]We got pretty close.
[328:11.62]The cat-dog friendship will last forever.
[328:13.34]Okay.
[328:26.06]I can go left.
[328:33.20]Jim.
[328:33.76]Jim.
[328:40.11]Jim.
[328:46.75]Stanley, that's me, what?
[328:57.58]Are they all?
[328:59.38]Is that the only one?
[329:19.34]is it Stanley okay oh cool 25 perfect that's a perfect number
[329:54.93]Thank you for enjoying the new content.
[329:59.67]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[330:01.03]That was fun.
[330:02.91]Anything else?
[330:05.59]Oh.
[330:10.05]Hello again.
[330:10.51]It's nice to see you.
[330:14.57]But it's terrible to learn that there will never be another Stanley Parable game.
[330:20.01]Did you read what the developer said?
[330:21.25]Preserve the integrity of the franchise.
[330:23.93]What nonsense.
[330:25.92]The Stanley Parable is not sacred.
[330:27.50]We do not need to protect it.
[330:29.66]Screw the legacy.
[330:30.40]Let's keep making Stanley Parable games until the sun explodes.
[330:33.80]Let's run this franchise into the ground.
[330:35.89]Let's drag it through the mud and back.
[330:38.35]And if people hate it, who cares?
[330:40.51]You see, that was the narrator's problem.
[330:42.37]He was so obsessed with what people thought of his work.
[330:45.39]Don't make his mistake.
[330:46.35]Don't cling to the legacy.
[330:47.31]Let it burn.
[330:48.61]It's not hard.
[330:49.15]In fact, let me show you.
[330:50.49]Together, we're going to make The Stanley Parable 3.
[330:53.61]It's simple.
[330:54.05]All we do is change the number in a game's title screen.
[330:57.03]We also really need a really dumb subtitle for the game.
[330:59.71]Something loud and gaudy.
[331:01.94]Good.
[331:02.14]Try combining some random words together to make a new title for our game.
[331:07.38]What would I say?
[331:08.08]Let's get it.
[331:08.50]Stanley Parable 3.
[331:10.76]Let's get it.
[331:27.51]Stanley Parable 3.
[331:28.01]Pantry.
[331:30.57]Pantry.
[331:38.58]the pantry.
[331:57.15]Yeah.
[332:02.05]I love it.
[332:03.21]Every time you restart the game, we'll advance the number of sequels by one and then we'll pick a new subtitle.
[332:09.42]That way The Stanley Parable will never end, and nothing in the game itself will change when you do this either.
[332:14.86]Adding more content sounds like work.
[332:16.22]No need to do that.
[332:18.20]It'll just be the same content recycled again and again and again with a new title screen.
[332:21.68]What do you say?
[332:23.62]Should we go forward with this plan?
[332:25.62]I like it, but I want you to have a say as well.
[332:31.38]Should I do that?
[332:32.90]That sounds kind of funny.
[332:35.12]Sure, let's do it.
[332:37.97]A new sequel every time you start the game and you know what since you've put faith in my idea I feel like giving you something as well.
[332:43.00]See I'm noticing that the narrator's never found a way to give you the broken achievement, did he?
[332:48.00]Of course not I wouldn't expect him to know how.
[332:50.00]It's been bothering me, let's fix it.
[332:52.00]Alright there, the achievement machine is all fixed.
[332:54.00]See, I'm on your side. We're in this together.
[332:56.00]We're going to keep this train rolling. The Stanley Parable cannot end. It can only spiral in on itself forever.
[333:02.00]I must keep the wheel turning.
[333:04.00]I'm ready. Are you ready?
[333:07.45]Great, there's only one last thing we need to do.
[333:09.81]Please enter the current time.
[333:10.77]9.30.
[333:10.79]9.30.
[333:16.64]That's my favorite time.
[333:40.86]Okay?
[333:48.87]This is the story of a man named Stanley.
[333:53.86]Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.
[333:59.08]Employee number 427's job was simple.
[334:03.53]He sat at his desk in room 427 and... How do I go get the achievement?
[334:08.97]Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.
[334:17.15]This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year.
[334:23.13]The new content door?
[334:24.01]Although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in.
[334:30.26]Oh, the content door, okay.
[334:31.00]As though he had been made exactly for this job.
[334:34.60]And Stanley was happy.
[334:36.60]So the narrator made this guy up.
[334:39.61]I know one day something very peculiar happened.
[334:43.21]Something that would forever change Stanley.
[334:46.31]Something he would never quite forget.
[334:49.20]He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.
[334:57.78]No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say hi.
[335:03.79]Never in all his years at the company had this happened.
[335:07.33]This complete isolation.
[335:09.30]I don't think the intro changes.
[335:10.30]Something was very clearly wrong.
[335:12.68]Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.
[335:18.96]But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.
[335:24.95]Okay.
[335:28.08]All of his co-workers were gone.
[335:30.12]What could it mean?
[335:31.60]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[335:33.61]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[335:35.55]Where's the new content?
[335:44.50]Where's the content?
[335:45.56]The embrace of an old friend.
[335:47.76]A weathered companionship that stands the test of time.
[335:53.56]Stanley clung the bucket to his cheek.
[335:56.44]Could his co-workers really all be gone?
[336:07.55]Oh, please.
[336:08.95]Are you really just doing this for the achievement?
[336:11.19]Yeah.
[336:11.59]Click a door five times.
[336:13.06]Is that all that you think an achievement is worth?
[336:15.42]No, no, no, no, no.
[336:16.86]I can't just give these merits away for such little effort.
[336:20.02]A measly five clicks.
[336:21.62]How many do you want?
[336:22.46]Now suppose you were to click the door 20 times.
[336:25.07]You got it.
[336:25.39]I would say that's the kind of effort that warrants recognition.
[336:32.77]I have to say I'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort for a noble cause.
[336:37.69]It's going to be like a thousand.
[336:38.57]Perhaps 50 clicks will do it.
[336:40.19]Yes, almost certainly 50 clicks.
[336:47.29]Oh my god.
[336:47.89]What?
[336:48.05]Don't bring a bucket into this.
[336:48.83]Oh, fuck you.
[336:49.13]Fine. 417?
[337:19.46]Okay, great.
[337:20.24]Now, go touch the bucket on door 437 a few times.
[337:25.03]Just open the door, please.
[337:28.61]437?
[337:29.43]Yes.
[337:30.19]Now we're getting somewhere.
[337:31.69]How about door 415?
[337:33.07]Give it some bucket love.
[337:37.02]Mm-hmm.
[337:40.92]Hey, there it is!
[337:43.90]Now back to door number 437.
[337:54.27]You know, I think the copy machine needs some attention.
[337:57.51]Why don't you rub the bucket on it a bit?
[338:00.83]Alright.
[338:01.43]Back to room 417.
[338:03.07]I'm really feeling it now.
[338:04.71]I think we're getting somewhere.
[338:05.93]OK.
[338:09.14]OK, now bring the bucket on top of employee 419's desk.
[338:22.73]Hey!
[338:23.03]What the fuck?
[338:32.62]On top of the desk.
[338:37.66]How do I climb up it?
[338:38.98]I can't climb up.
[338:42.51]Yes, this is great.
[338:43.93]Now the bucket knows exactly what it's like to be employee 419.
[338:48.11]Now, let's introduce it to door 416.
[338:55.06]Okay.
[338:58.26]Where's 416?
[338:58.48]415?
[338:58.50]Where's 416?
[338:59.00]Is this 416?
[339:01.95]417?
[339:01.97]420?
[339:01.99]416 probably right here?
[339:04.55]456? 425?
[339:20.89]Stanley clicked on literally every single door in the office because he doesn't pick up well on cues from his environment.
[339:33.32]Where is it?
[339:34.35]416?
[339:39.93]Is it this one?
[339:41.19]It's the new content door.
[339:44.81]Oh.
[339:46.41]I can't complete it.
[339:48.46]What?
[339:55.80]It's right here, look!
[339:58.91]What?
[339:59.25]Come on, it's right here.
[340:01.11]Fifty times?
[340:05.95]Shit, it's broken.
[340:07.63]God damn it, oh well.
[340:15.24]It has to be the true 416, aww.
[340:20.69]That's alright.
[340:26.02]Hello, and thank you for playing The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.
[340:31.49]As you may know, The Stanley Parable was a video game released in 2013 on home computers.
[340:39.09]After receiving critical and commercial success, it was expanded to 2022 with The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, a reimagining of the game for consoles and home computers.
[340:50.31]I'll fix it when I wake up tomorrow.
[340:51.87]Is that a div?
[340:52.89]The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe features exciting new content that broadens and expands the world of The Stanley Parable, delighting audiences the world over.
[341:03.09]That's all good to me.
[341:05.19]Please, step inside and see what thrilling new adventures await in The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.
[341:12.82]Oh, well, this sounds delightful.
[341:14.70]I'm very excited to see the thrilling new Ultra Deluxe content.
[341:20.91]I'll do the mind control one without the bucket after this and that's probably it.
[341:23.74]Hmm.
[341:40.24]Hold on.
[341:41.26]Did I already show you my ideas for the sequel?
[341:44.46]I don't remember doing that at all.
[341:46.48]You're seeing things all out of order.
[341:49.50]He's going to fix it, isn't he?
[341:51.56]I'm going to get to the achievement room and he's going to be like, no, no, no, this is wrong.
[341:55.19]You shouldn't be here yet.
[341:56.23]The jump circle.
[341:57.99]Alright, let's see.
[341:58.87]It's the jump circle.
[342:03.69]He's not going to let me touch the machine.
[342:08.76]I'm gonna go reach for it.
[342:09.64]He's gonna reset the game.
[342:11.66]I bet.
[342:13.10]A dollar.
[342:16.84]To myself.
[342:17.38]Yeah.
[342:17.52]Yeah.
[342:17.64]Eh.
[342:39.16]You had a little bit of trouble.
[342:41.44]You had a little bit of trouble.
[342:45.17]Wait.
[342:45.85]If you're still carrying the bucket around with you, if the bucket is interesting to you, that means I must have made it correctly.
[342:53.17]Yes.
[342:53.99]You carrying the bucket with you everywhere is exactly what I set out to accomplish.
[342:59.02]The bucket is the exciting and captivating new content that I promised.
[343:03.24]I did it!
[343:03.98]I win!
[343:04.82]I made a sequel to The Stanley Parable!
[343:07.92]Yes, the sign is correct.
[343:09.14]Thank you for enjoying the new content.
[343:11.28]Take that, gamers.
[343:11.88]Okay.
[343:44.28]Hey, but wait.
[343:45.16]I wanted to go to... I wanted to go to the sequel area.
[343:50.55]I want to... Oh, I got to go without the bucket.
[343:58.79]I have to go without... with the bucket?
[344:06.66]Yeah, I don't bring the bucket.
[344:07.74]Yeah.
[344:08.00]No, no, no.
[344:08.36]No bucket, right?
[344:08.92]Because then they'll... Yeah, without the bucket.
[344:12.88]Alright, let's go.
[344:14.84]yeah bring bucket take the bucket no no no do a bucket get the bucket take the bucket no no don't bring the bucket I got the bucket made Stanley want to be a better man and a better co-worker in time perhaps he would become both of those things alright I'm going in with a bucket
[344:45.70]Everybody's called me an idiot, and here we are.
[344:46.99]We're fine.
[344:56.47]You see Stanley I've been reflecting on The Stanley Parable and about how roundly Disappointing this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be I don't think so which nor Stanley Parable was a landmark I think it adds a lot new content for it should live up to that legacy So forget this ultra deluxe nonsense.
[345:14.46]I say we know no no no no no no even further
[345:18.44]Which is why I'm very proud to announce for the first time ever The Stanley Parable 2.
[345:28.67]Oh, no, we're good.
[345:31.49]Yes, you see, isn't this far superior to a measly re-release with a few minor additions?
[345:36.89]Think of all the new territory we'll cover with a fully fledged sequel.
[345:40.71]An entirely new experience, built from the ground up.
[345:44.10]Why there are so many possibilities, it could go in so many different directions.
[345:48.72]This is what fans have truly been asking for.
[345:52.60]Look at the table.
[345:53.38]Too late.
[345:54.06]Too late.
[345:54.32]Alright, let's go.
[345:55.07]Achievement.
[345:55.77]Two buckets.
[346:22.22]Okay, let's go get two buckets.
[346:23.46]Give me a second bucket.
[346:24.50]I deserve it.
[346:39.98]Wait.
[346:40.72]There are two buckets here.
[346:41.82]How did you get a second bucket?
[346:43.58]I don't know if there are two buckets.
[346:45.01]What?
[346:45.23]Oh!
[346:57.86]What?
[346:58.06]No!
[346:58.12]Oh, get out of here.
[346:58.84]What am I going to do now without that?
[347:00.62]I was so used to picking it up every single day.
[347:02.70]Oh, well.
[347:26.70]Okay.
[347:28.32]Uh, now... The achievement room, right?
[347:31.79]Alright, where's the free achievement?
[347:36.87]This way.
[347:41.13]That's sad.
[347:41.55]Alright, here we go.
[347:51.89]Free achievement.
[347:54.56]Now, here's something special.
[347:56.18]You remember that broken test achievement that got left in the game on accident?
[348:00.20]Well, I'm developing a technology to simply give you the achievement.
[348:05.04]You see, you all come to this lever and when you pull it, the achievement will be given to you.
[348:09.74]It's as simple as that.
[348:10.98]Got it.
[348:16.32]As you can see, the machine is not working yet.
[348:18.76]Yes, it is.
[348:19.83]Wait, what in the holy hell is going on?
[348:22.49]You got the achievement?
[348:24.98]Oh, God.
[348:39.18]Cool.
[348:39.36]Alright, I got it.
[348:40.98]I win.
[349:09.25]Should I do the infinite hole?
[349:10.25]Stop biting your lip.
[349:25.13]Alright, where's the hole?
[349:26.01]Your blood is leaking out.
[349:27.83]Alright, look at the hole.
[349:28.55]What time is it right now?
[349:30.09]It is currently just about 10 p.m.
[349:31.69]It's 9.50 p.m.
[349:51.52]Stanley, here's an idea that I'm truly fond of.
[349:54.38]It's never been done before in a video game.
[349:56.83]This is, in fact, a hole that you can fall down forever.
[350:00.89]That's right.
[350:01.95]Infinite falling.
[350:03.57]You can fall until the end of time, if you like.
[350:06.71]A stunningly broad for video games as a medium.
[350:10.39]Okay, anything change here?
[350:12.09]Nothing changes here?
[350:12.71]Alright, nothing changes?
[350:13.84]Alright.
[350:14.26]Okay, cool.
[350:14.60]I don't have the bucket, that's right.
[350:47.51]Okay.
[350:48.95]So... I think I'm gonna... I wanna go do the mine control without the bucket.
[350:57.61]I had the bucket the first time.
[350:58.67]You sure?
[351:02.69]Yeah, no, I did it already.
[351:04.08]All the weird stuff.
[351:09.80]Alright, we're gonna reset.
[351:14.11]And I want to go do the mind control thing, turn the machine on without the bucket.
[351:17.61]And then that'll probably wrap it up.
[351:20.22]All of his coworkers were gone.
[351:22.28]What could it mean?
[351:23.78]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[351:25.78]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[351:35.52]Do the window ending?
[351:37.14]I'm looking at the windows.
[351:37.88]I don't see a window.
[351:41.23]Yeah, I did the infinite hole thing a long time ago, yeah.
[351:43.95]Okay, I'm not doing that.
[351:48.13]We're going to go turn on the mind control machine.
[351:51.59]Which is... The left, right?
[351:52.17]No, where is it?
[351:52.55]It's the right.
[351:53.01]Jump out the window.
[351:53.97]Alright, we'll do that after this.
[352:10.81]I want to turn on the mind control thing.
[352:12.40]Checking.
[352:16.82]Then it's down, right?
[352:17.42]Is it down?
[352:17.86]To go to the mind control room?
[352:19.96]No, it's up.
[352:43.88]Oh, up.
[352:45.04]Oh, okay.
[352:46.82]So up, alright.
[352:49.59]It's the... Gotta go to the catwalk.
[352:57.37]I know I'm not supposed to talk about these things.
[353:00.99]Mods and... Mods are gonna be pissed.
[353:02.75]But, I just... Somebody... You added the term to a...
[353:10.08]Uh-oh, mods typing.
[353:17.88]Unraveled, Stanley wandered in disbelief.
[353:20.56]Who orchestrated this?
[353:22.12]What dark secret was being held from him?
[353:25.02]What he could not... Stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible.
[353:29.82]I'm not going to enable it.
[353:31.42]Stop reading.
[353:32.08]I'm not going to read this stuff anyway.
[353:33.46]Nope, I'm not doing it.
[353:34.62]I'm not putting pressure on the mods for no reason.
[353:36.76]Stop reading our stuff.
[353:37.72]No, no.
[353:59.88]Wait, you hold on.
[354:01.70]I,
[354:26.57]apparently a term was permitted to permissions like to add to permissions right permitted term finger butthole it was added to the permitted terms not removed not banned that is permitted
[354:55.36]Was it banned because of the Elden Ring streams?
[355:01.58]Oh, and there it is gone.
[355:04.80]It was definitely because of the Elden Ring streams.
[355:06.36]People were probably just like, finger butthole, my finger butthole.
[355:10.59]I get it, I get it.
[355:11.35]But now that it's like, you know, it's been a while, let's add the term finger butthole.
[355:17.47]And then I just ruined it.
[355:23.94]Whoops.
[355:29.68]Everybody relax with the chill music, alright?
[355:33.08]Feeling soothed and rejuvenated, Stanley calmly walked forward into the opened passage.
[355:38.83]It's just funny, like, oh, show the humor with that.
[355:42.93]That's very humorous.
[355:47.35]It's like I look over and I see, like, oh, permissions added for, you know, finger, butthole.
[355:53.26]Like, oh, okay, we got permissions.
[356:07.80]I just make the mods job way, way harder, don't I?
[356:17.59]That gets you banned.
[356:18.35]That gets you timed out.
[356:19.53]And I am making it really, really difficult.
[356:24.21]But the running joke is that I would be banned from my own chat.
[356:27.30]True.
[356:27.40]Okay, here we go.
[356:45.64]Let's turn it on.
[356:46.68]Without the bucket.
[356:47.36]I want to see what the mind control ending without the bucket is.
[356:51.48]What horrible secret did this place hold?
[356:52.70]Stanley thought to himself.
[356:53.47]Did he have the strength to find out?
[357:17.15]now the monitors jump to life their true nature revealed each bore the number of an employee in the building okay so what happens when I turn it on the lives of so many individuals and then I'll do that window ending that people are saying then that's it one of them eternally monitored in this place where freedom meant nothing
[357:39.04]Uh-oh, mods going chaotic evil.
[357:41.80]I'm allowing all of these.
[357:43.00]Uh-oh.
[357:43.50]Uh-oh.
[357:45.58]Uh-oh.
[358:05.51]No, he refused to believe it.
[358:08.35]He couldn't accept it.
[358:10.05]His own life in someone else's control?
[358:12.93]Never.
[358:13.05]It was unthinkable, wasn't it?
[358:17.33]Was it even possible?
[358:19.04]Had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world?
[358:24.20]Alright, now you guys, now you're just reaching.
[358:31.18]Now you're reaching.
[358:32.94]You're reaching now.
[358:34.72]You're all reaching.
[358:35.50]You're- hey, you're playing with fire.
[358:37.50]I'm just saying, you're playing with fire.
[358:40.00]You're gonna get timed out.
[358:41.12]Careful!
[358:41.32]Careful!
[358:41.56]You don't want to touch that line too far.
[358:43.10]Be careful!
[358:43.55]Alright, turn it on.
[359:02.61]Oh, Stanley.
[359:03.43]You didn't just activate the controls, did you?
[359:06.68]After they kept you enslaved all these years, you go and you try to take control of the machine for yourself.
[359:11.55]Is that what you wanted?
[359:12.97]Control?
[359:15.90]Hmm.
[359:16.60]Hmm.
[359:34.11]I'm afraid you don't have nearly the power you think you do.
[359:36.80]For example, and I believe you'll find this pertinent, Stanley suddenly realized he had just initiated the network's emergency detonation system.
[359:46.55]What?
[359:51.97]nuclear detonators are said to explode, eliminating the entire complex.
[359:59.96]Let's say, um, two minutes.
[360:03.59]Ah, now this is making things a little more fun, isn't it, Stanley?
[360:06.63]It's your time to shine.
[360:08.43]You are the star.
[360:09.87]It's your story now.
[360:11.49]Shape it to your heart's desires.
[360:13.83]Oh, this is much better than what I had in mind.
[360:16.41]What a shame we have so little time left to enjoy it.
[360:19.43]Mere moments until the bomb goes off.
[360:22.30]But what precious moments each one of them is.
[360:25.32]More time to talk about you, about me, where we're going, what all this means.
[360:31.32]I barely know where to start.
[360:34.79]Four.
[360:36.15]You'd like to know where your co-workers are.
[360:37.91]I need to press the number four.
[360:38.97]A moment of solace before you're obliterated.
[360:42.65]One, two.
[360:43.51]You're going to die anyway.
[360:44.91]I'll tell you exactly what happened to them.
[360:47.41]I erased them.
[360:48.93]I turned off the machine.
[360:50.11]I set you free.
[360:51.85]Free.
[360:52.33]Where's four?
[360:53.35]Where's four?
[360:56.48]I simply let you sit there in your office forever, pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone.
[361:02.63]Other times, I let the office sink into the ground, swallowing everyone inside, or I let it burn to a crisp.
[361:10.40]That four?
[361:11.46]This version of events has been rather amusing.
[361:14.42]Watching you try to make sense of everything and take back the control rested away from you.
[361:18.82]Four.
[361:19.06]It's quite rich.
[361:20.42]I almost hate to see it go.
[361:22.18]But I'm sure whatever I come up with on the next go-around will be even better.
[361:27.68]Four.
[361:28.54]My goodness, only 34 seconds left.
[361:31.88]But I'm enjoying this so much.
[361:34.14]You know what?
[361:34.94]To hell with it.
[361:36.04]I'm going to put some extra time on the clock, why not?
[361:40.02]These are precious additional seconds, Stanley.
[361:42.87]Time doesn't grow on trees.
[361:46.23]Oh dear me, what's the matter, Stanley?
[361:48.59]Is it that you have no idea where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing right now?
[361:52.61]What the fuck?
[361:53.21]Or did you just assume when you saw that timer that something in this room was capable of turning it off?
[361:58.89]I mean, look at you.
[362:00.31]Running from button to button.
[362:02.31]Two.
[362:02.45]Screen to screen.
[362:03.79]Clicking on every little thing in this room.
[362:06.75]One.
[362:07.57]No, these colored ones.
[362:09.49]Or maybe this big red button.
[362:11.27]Or this door.
[362:12.81]Everything, anything, something here will save me.
[362:16.18]Breathe.
[362:29.09]But here's a spoiler for you that timer isn't a catalyst to keep the action moving along It's just seconds ticking away to your death You're only still playing instead of watching a cutscene because I want to watch you for every moment that you're powerless To see you made humble
[362:48.32]This is not a challenge.
[362:49.82]It's a tragedy.
[362:51.22]You wanted to control this world, that's fine.
[362:54.49]But I'm going to destroy it first, so you can't.
[363:18.62]Go ahead.
[363:25.80]Ah!
[363:38.51]Bullshit.
[363:46.58]Alright, where's the window?
[363:50.24]Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[363:52.25]Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[363:54.31]How do I... Where's the window one?
[363:55.21]No matter how hard Stanley looked, he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers.
[364:01.37]Use the chair?
[364:03.42]Other chair.
[364:03.90]Like up here?
[364:13.35]At first, Stanley assumed he'd broken the map until he heard this narration and realized it was part of the game's design all along.
[364:21.21]He then praised the game for its insightful and witty commentary into the nature of video game structure and its examination of structural narrative tropes.
[364:29.73]Do it again with the bucket.
[364:30.89]Now that you're here, what do you think?
[364:32.71]Isn't this a fun and unique place to be?
[364:35.01]Kind of.
[364:35.55]Why don't we take a minute just to drink it all in?
[364:38.12]Alright.
[364:39.67]Okay, I'm over it now.
[364:41.31]What do you think?
[364:41.93]Are you sick of this gag yet?
[364:43.21]No.
[364:46.43]Ah.
[364:47.03]Then in that case, we'll continue.
[364:48.89]But now, here comes the real question.
[364:51.37]What do you think would have happened if you had told me that you wanted this to stop?
[364:55.74]Do you think it would have been particularly different?
[364:58.06]Reset.
[364:58.64]Would I have taken the same idea but rephrased it superficially to fit that answer?
[365:03.86]Perhaps you never would even have thought of it if I hadn't brought up the issue in the first place.
[365:08.65]You would have reset the game.
[365:09.81]Now, think about it.
[365:10.71]Would it be worth it for you to restart and then come back here just to do the other option?
[365:16.41]Clearly, this whole gag takes some time.
[365:19.19]What if the other option is even longer?
[365:21.57]How long would you spend in total just to have heard all the narration?
[365:25.65]Oh, and this French, perhaps you just played the other option.
[365:29.13]Now you've come to see what happens in this one.
[365:31.99]so what do you think which choice was the better one imagine if you had selected continue on your first playthrough how tantalizing it would be not knowing what happens when you pick the other option indeed you are one of the lucky ones though if the other option is really miserable to listen to then perhaps you're not in fact I'm just going to say that no one who's listening to this is lucky
[365:57.32]Well now, I've built up the other options so much that I'm going to stop talking and leave you to your decision whether to come back here, continue with the game, or just sit in this spot forever and ever.
[366:09.81]Cheers.
[366:10.64]I'm coming back with the bucket, first of all.
[366:15.10]Okay, fuck off.
[366:20.20]Is that closed?
[366:20.68]What the fuck is that?
[366:48.67]Yes, whispered the bucket into Stanley's ear.
[366:51.59]We've done it.
[366:52.45]We've escaped from that dull office and that pesky narrator.
[366:55.74]At last, out here in the white void, we are alone.
[366:58.82]Now, and for the first time, I can reveal to you my true self.
[367:03.71]The bucket began to tell Stanley of its life and its history, of the countless wars it witnessed, desecrating the land and lives of untold numbers of innocent humans, and the bucket's own complicity therein, of sadness and regret, and the many years it spent dwelling on the actions it might have taken to curb the madness and the decay, if only it had been stronger.
[367:24.74]of hope and redemption, and its crusade to uplift the stock of life for the common man, to manifest justice where none existed, and the bittersweet reality of time to see one's dreams and wishes met halfway, meted out in parcels like charity, and abandoned as soon as the warm glow of inspiration begins to dim.
[367:45.05]The opportunities to do so much more.
[367:47.76]There was so much it could have done, perhaps, the bucket wondered to itself.
[367:52.32]Perhaps if it had seen its own darkness with a clearer perception.
[367:57.17]This was way too much for Stanley.
[367:59.28]What are you talking about?
[368:01.31]he screamed.
[368:02.17]You're a bucket!
[368:03.89]To this, the bucket furrowed its brow.
[368:06.81]No, said the bucket.
[368:08.43]Not since the evil wizard Gambhorata first ensnared me in his machinations as payback for the sacred amulet I stole from his treasured vaults.
[368:17.60]I was young back then and could not conceive the ramifications of...
[368:23.02]What the fuck?
[368:23.74]We're gonna see it.
[368:52.80]My God, Stanley, you did it.
[368:55.62]You saved us from the bucket.
[368:57.36]Thank God you already had all 12 emblems of sages and knew the incantations to summon their true power.
[369:04.17]Otherwise, we would have easily been overwhelmed by the bucket's power.
[369:07.85]I'm speechless.
[369:09.29]You've demonstrated such bravery here today.
[369:11.89]Come, let's restart the game, and we'll agree to never again go trifling with this bucket, nor the dark magic cast away inside of it.
[369:23.36]Blood.
[369:26.90]Alright.
[369:27.14]That's it.
[369:27.64]Alright.
[369:27.90]That's it.
[369:28.68]Alright.
[369:28.96]That's it.
[369:29.39]Alright.
[369:29.79]That's it.
[369:50.83]Still, no one was here.
[369:51.87]I'll see you tomorrow.
[369:52.35]That's it.
[369:52.71]Stanley needed the bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever.
[369:56.35]Perhaps, Stanley, we must move on from this broom closet simply because I have no remaining stickers.
[370:02.61]If I did, you'd come into a staircase.
[370:04.89]Stanley and the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office.
[370:09.99]No, don't go down here.
[370:11.05]I want to go up.
[370:25.83]Okay.
[370:27.18]So tomorrow we are going to do infomercials.
[370:30.78]Probably that's it.
[370:32.62]Probably stream tomorrow won't be that long.
[370:35.12]It'll be like four showers.
[370:37.06]Three to five.
[370:38.68]Watch infomercials.
[370:54.08]Okay, now I go back up, right?
[371:03.49]Oh, not yet.
[371:06.65]Do you like this game?
[371:08.67]Wait, down then up, okay.
[371:12.55]Yeah, I do.
[371:13.01]I think it's fun.
[371:21.81]The elevator raced downward, plummeting towards an unknown fate.
[371:27.19]It would be all Stanley could do to keep himself together, if not for the bucket.
[371:31.83]Soothing him, comforting him, reassuring that in this darkest moment of uncertainty, he would be right.
[371:37.36]Are you going to finish this game?
[371:38.98]The bucket is here for you, Stanley.
[371:41.20]Everything will be fine.
[371:45.36]I think I did.
[371:46.14]Didn't I get to the few endings like the true ending?
[371:49.67]I think I saw the true ending.
[371:50.43]I think I've seen it.
[371:51.03]Okay.
[372:19.41]Press the number three?
[372:23.62]Here we are, said Stanley.
[372:24.96]Now I'm going to try out that number three button.
[372:27.84]He took the bucket over to the keypad and began absolutely slamming on the number three over and over and over.
[372:35.02]Well, he said, the number three is such a special button, I'm having the time of my life.
[372:40.94]Stanley looked expectantly at the bucket, but the bucket remained silent.
[372:45.52]This was a shock to Stanley.
[372:47.33]who had always felt such a connection with the bucket.
[372:50.15]How was this not as exciting to the bucket as it was to him?
[372:53.98]Once Stanley had had enough of the number three, he got back in the elevator.
[373:23.24]Do it eight times.
[373:31.48]Eight.
[373:31.74]Whatever.
[373:45.46]That was weird.
[373:52.23]Perhaps the bucket had missed something.
[373:54.93]Perhaps it had not seen how much joy Stanley got from slamming the number three repeatedly.
[373:59.58]Go back up?
[374:04.84]A hint of regret nagged in the back of Stanley's mind.
[374:08.45]Should he demonstrate the number three for the bucket again?
[374:11.27]Sure.
[374:15.37]Yeah, the voice actor for the narrator is amazing.
[374:17.19]Very funny.
[374:17.55]Perfect.
[374:17.75]Perfect role.
[374:45.70]Okay, three.
[374:48.41]Here we go, said Stanley.
[374:50.13]This time I'll really show you.
[374:52.49]He ran to the number three and began to wail on it like a musician on a beloved instrument, weaving a concerto of truth and passion.
[375:01.10]He wielded the number three like a fine artist would wield a paintbrush.
[375:05.47]He told stories through the number three, stories of his dreams and hopes and fears.
[375:11.03]And the whole time he looked to his bucket for a reaction of some kind.
[375:15.87]Anything to let him know that the bucket appreciated what he was doing.
[375:20.75]The bucket conveyed absolutely nothing at all, only silence.
[375:25.53]Crushed by a wave of dejection, Stanley returned to the elevator.
[375:29.79]The bucket hates me now?
[375:35.92]Why?
[375:42.94]Stanley and the bucket were so close, they'd always been there for one another.
[375:47.14]Why suddenly could the bucket not connect with his passion of Stannis?
[375:51.39]The question caused Stanley to ruminate the whole way down the elevator.
[375:54.07]You killed the bucket.
[375:54.55]I did not kill the bucket.
[375:56.25]He knew that there must be a way to get through to the bucket, to communicate fully with his dear friend.
[376:01.91]Surely there was a solution, mustn't there be?
[376:04.13]That was in Another Life.
[376:20.52]Do it again.
[376:20.88]Do it again.
[376:23.30]Again.
[376:24.64]Again.
[376:24.88]Ha ha ha, said Stanley.
[376:28.06]I know what to do.
[376:29.46]I know how to fully express this feeling in my heart.
[376:33.37]He decided right then and there that he would hold a press conference where he would speak to the public on all matters relating to pressing the number three over and over.
[376:44.09]He would elaborate fully on what the number three meant to him, and why he felt so alive when pressing it.
[376:49.74]Then the bucket would be able to see his joy through the eyes of others.
[376:54.66]It would get to see the world react to this discovery of stamina's.
[376:59.33]And it would be through the public eye that the bucket would finally understand stamina's work.
[377:05.65]press conference The months he advertised a market at his press conference building excitement around it developing and rehearsing it until it couldn't be refined a single measure further When the big day arrived Stanley was as prepared as he'd ever been for anything in his life Stage door, okay
[377:40.41]this was it one last chance to win the bucket over one opportunity to share a true connection with a loved one okay the dude who came up with pizza
[378:05.43]There was no one here.
[378:07.73]Nobody had come to the press conference to hear Stanley speak, to listen to him talk about what it really means to press the number three on a keypad over and over.
[378:18.79]Nobody?
[378:19.75]Literally no one?
[378:21.22]He was a failure.
[378:22.62]No one.
[378:23.04]In that moment, Stanley knew that the bucket would never again take him seriously.
[378:28.42]There would be no connection, no deeper understanding.
[378:32.97]The bucket merely sat there in his arms, indifferent.
[378:36.30]And so it began that slowly, over many years, the two of them grew more and more distant.
[378:41.92]They spoke less and less, neither wishing to state the obvious that any sense of real respect between them had eroded since that day at the press conference.
[378:52.50]There would be no more games, no more long conversations about passion and pursuit, only a silence that consumed the space between friends.
[379:04.52]And Stanley, having for once in his life discovered the warmth and comfort of true companionship, was cast back into the unremarkable normalcy of loneliness.
[379:17.49]I thought you said nobody was here.
[379:18.31]I just heard somebody cough.
[379:22.78]It was a lie.
[379:31.56]Wait, rare phone spawn.
[379:33.63]Rare phone spawn?
[379:39.71]This, where is it?
[379:53.79]Hello, this is a recorded message scheduled either by you or a person in your place of work.
[379:59.49]The purpose of this message is to warn you about the dangers of recorded messages.
[380:04.17]If at any time you believe you are listening to a recorded message, please terminate it immediately and cease all flow of information from the recorded message into your perceptual sphere.
[380:15.10]Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[380:18.54]Oh, it's your first day.
[380:19.56]Be careful for Foxy.
[380:22.42]Watch out.
[380:23.09]The thing that I want to tell you about Foxy is Foxy.
[380:29.55]Eh, Foxy.
[380:32.88]Stanley cradled the bucket in a gentle embrace.
[380:35.88]Protective, yet delicate.
[380:37.86]Assertive, yet compassionate.
[380:39.95]Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest.
[380:42.29]This was not the correct way to the meeting room.
[380:44.85]But Stanley had felt the bucket calling to him.
[380:47.47]Telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be.
[380:52.30]And here it was.
[380:53.42]Had the bucket turned out to be correct?
[380:55.36]Was no.
[380:56.30]Never mind.
[380:56.94]The bucket was wrong.
[380:59.62]Stanley took the door on his left to go back to the meeting room.
[381:04.95]No, said the bucket.
[381:07.01]Don't go to the meeting room.
[381:08.57]Go somewhere else.
[381:09.97]The cargo lift.
[381:10.87]Yeah, good, said the bucket.
[381:13.21]Whatever.
[381:15.69]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[381:26.04]Wait, I want to try this.
[381:26.66]I want to restart the game.
[381:30.47]Turn it off.
[381:32.03]Will it be Stanley Parable 4 when I open it again?
[381:34.59]And that's the last thing I want to see.
[381:36.37]I'll give you my review for The Stanley Parable 2.
[381:38.41]The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe Edition.
[381:43.48]I think it's a really good... I think it's a good edition.
[381:48.92]I think it's like the definitive version of the game.
[381:51.62]I think it's very good.
[381:59.68]There's definitely enough content there.
[382:01.08]And plus, it's just a fun experience.
[382:04.83]It was very nice.
[382:06.01]It was a very nice time.
[382:07.11]Alright, that's it.
[382:29.15]See you later.
[382:32.86]See you tomorrow around 4 o'clock.
[382:36.14]We'll watch some infomercials for a few hours.
[382:47.93]Have a great night.
[382:50.93]Thanks for joining me as always.
[382:55.47]Fun to play games with you.
[382:57.59]You know.
[383:04.69]There's a ton of infomercials and the reason why I only want to do like three or four hours is I don't want to overdo it because they're so stimulating and there's so much that you can kind of get like infomercial overload.
[383:19.24]I think like a solid three or four hours is good.
[383:30.43]That's the plan for tomorrow.
[383:37.17]Infomercial scientist.
[383:42.71]You promise to eat a glove?
[383:44.63]And I am.
[383:45.05]I just gotta get one.
[383:49.22]Might take me a little while to find the right one.
[383:53.90]You promise to eat a glove?
[383:54.72]I'm gonna eat a glove.
[383:55.62]I just gotta find the right glove.
[383:59.24]Make sure it fits well.
[384:00.94]Make sure it's there.
[384:03.40]Make sure it's got the right spices on it and everything.
[384:11.67]Alright, goodnight.
[384:12.17]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[384:13.54]Take care of yourselves.
[384:14.20]Call your mother.
[384:18.09]See you later.
[385:00.24]you
[385:35.12]you
