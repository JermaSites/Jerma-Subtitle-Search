[00:01.16]Good afternoon.
[00:03.68]Hi.
[00:11.68]Hello, everybody.
[00:15.88]Do you know how much your turnips are?
[00:17.70]No.
[00:18.30]Okay, you know what?
[00:19.03]No, I do know.
[00:20.55]My turnips every day are worth 12, 10 bells for a stack.
[00:28.76]So you don't want to... My island sucks.
[00:31.80]You don't want to come to visit my... They're worthless.
[00:33.96]See?
[00:34.30]And they're worthless every day.
[00:37.24]Twelve bells a stack.
[00:38.24]Yeah, it's bad.
[00:39.94]So now people don't need to know.
[00:42.23]Don't come to me!
[00:44.53]Is that like shove the fucking gold bars under the bed?
[00:47.21]My turnips are worthless!
[00:56.28]He's got
[00:58.07]Yo, Jerma.
[00:59.15]Yo, hey.
[01:02.26]Is he playing No More Heroes?
[01:03.78]Yo.
[01:05.36]Yo.
[01:06.40]Yes, I am.
[01:06.96]I played it yesterday.
[01:09.42]Were you here yesterday?
[01:14.77]I'm probably at like the 40%, 30% point in the game.
[01:20.97]The idea is to try to finish this today.
[01:23.55]And if I don't, then we'll finish it tomorrow and do something else after it's done.
[01:29.78]I had to go early yesterday.
[01:37.15]Is the cat still a fat boy?
[01:40.15]Uh, well, you'll see.
[01:43.93]So here's the plan.
[01:45.39]Here comes the remainder of the week.
[01:46.79]I'll give it to you.
[01:48.28]No more Heroes 2 tonight.
[01:50.06]Trying to finish it tonight.
[01:52.42]If I finish it tonight, then I'm playing Resident Evil 3 Remake tomorrow.
[01:56.66]Hopefully finishing that in one stream too.
[02:01.74]on Thursday if that's the case if I beat this today beat Resident Evil 3 tomorrow and on Thursday we're going to get a special treat of tiny toons wacky sports and maybe one other super Nintendo game of my choosing the plan now this plan falls apart if I do not beat this tonight
[02:24.41]If I still have another 2, 3, 4 plus hours of content in No More Heroes 2, then I'm going to play it tomorrow.
[02:33.68]And then when it's done, gauge the environment.
[02:37.30]And see if there's enough time for me to do Tiny Toons Wacky Sports.
[02:40.72]And then do Resident Evil 3 on Thursday.
[02:45.28]Or potentially the start of the next week.
[02:48.09]I'm not sure yet.
[02:49.21]But Resident Evil 3 will happen.
[02:52.39]We'll see.
[02:54.18]Don't stall and start.
[02:55.24]I spent three minutes.
[02:58.40]We need every moment to make sure you can beat this.
[03:01.34]Every single second counts today.
[03:06.33]Dude, every second counts today.
[03:09.91]Alright, fucking alright, alright.
[03:14.71]I'm ready.
[03:15.37]Now he's stalling.
[03:19.41]I'm not stalling.
[03:20.67]It's been four minutes.
[03:24.57]Don't make me put on the anime, I will.
[03:26.07]Alright, let's go.
[03:29.35]You caught us, uh, if you haven't been here since yesterday.
[03:32.87]Uh, we're... No More Heroes 2, this is the sequel.
[03:41.56]I tried to, uh, wait.
[03:45.54]Didn't I do... Oh, right, right, right.
[03:46.78]No, I opened it once and said, no, I'm done.
[03:48.76]Okay, I remember.
[03:52.42]I'm gonna do... How much money do I have?
[03:55.86]I'm ready for the next mission.
[04:02.28]Love this series, bro.
[04:03.93]Yeah, I can't wait for the third one.
[04:07.79]Oh, I forgot.
[04:08.43]You can press B. Um...
[04:18.38]I read the tweet and thought it was Nioh 2.
[04:20.42]No, not Nioh 2.
[04:29.50]Hey, that's true.
[04:31.42]The paper boy's a genius.
[04:32.60]Does anybody else feel like if you stood in one of those, it would just make you shit?
[04:35.78]Like, I'd have to go to the bathroom in five minutes after that happened.
[04:39.37]It's just shaking you and vibrating all your, like, intestines and stuff.
[04:42.61]Yes, the association resorts to this when there isn't much activity in the rankings, or when there are too many strong fighters, or sometimes when we just get bored.
[04:53.17]If you're like, Gerba, I'll give you $10,000 if you drink a full coffee and stand in one of those for 12 minutes and not have to go to the bathroom.
[05:01.63]I'd probably lose.
[05:02.23]P.R.
[05:14.30]We like Fortnite.
[05:15.02]You guys.
[05:15.40]Fucked up.
[05:15.94]Fucked up.
[05:16.60]Mature streamer.
[05:17.78]I'm just keeping it on permanently.
[05:18.88]I put that on for the drug stream and then I never took it off and I'm never going to take it off.
[05:43.93]Okay, so we got ranking battle.
[05:47.55]I... Let's go.
[05:51.81]Oh, Destroy Man!
[05:54.28]Wait, is Destroy Man in this?
[05:55.64]Is he?
[05:56.80]I don't remember.
[06:01.58]Destroy Kena!
[06:04.44]Is it actually Destroy Man?
[06:06.10]I love watching a group battle.
[06:08.80]In all its chaos.
[06:11.26]But those fighters.
[06:13.17]Poor things.
[06:14.87]They never have a chance.
[06:17.01]And where's the fun in that?
[06:18.87]I don't know why.
[06:20.17]In my brain, she's playing hand simulator.
[06:22.13]That's like a hand simulator setup.
[06:24.69]To dial the phone number.
[06:25.97]Why am I thinking that?
[06:26.71]And there was much to reveal.
[06:37.95]He's trying hard not to talk about- No, I'm fine.
[06:47.76]Damn, is it my turn yet?
[06:50.42]Uh, anybody work here?
[06:53.04]This is taking forever.
[06:55.32]Open the gate so I can kick some ass.
[06:58.89]What's that meme?
[06:59.65]Did it work?
[07:00.77]You connect the legs?
[07:01.85]Somebody do it.
[07:15.99]The game is stalling.
[07:17.01]What?
[07:21.01]Visual sensors suggest carnage- Oh, it's this guy.
[07:24.63]Who is my next victim?
[07:26.25]Question mark.
[07:27.55]Surprise gasp.
[07:29.19]You are identified as Travis Touchdown.
[07:32.19]Luck is an irrational concept, but your presence defies probability.
[07:36.31]Do you remember me?
[07:37.51]Question mark.
[07:38.41]I do.
[07:39.05]You died.
[07:39.83]Last game.
[07:40.67]I don't know who or what the fu- Wait a second.
[07:48.88]yeah you're that fifth ranked freak Henry sliced up before I got it's gonna happen again right it has to affirmative after near fatal decimation I had no choice but to take this modified looks to me like you just gained a few pounds
[08:05.81]Hardware was effective, but my pride was not.
[08:09.57]With determination levels maximum, I thought only of winning.
[08:13.59]It was meaningless, futile, illogical.
[08:16.39]But such is the curse of being run by a human brain.
[08:24.54]It's a 5G tower.
[08:27.28]Why is that always funny?
[08:29.54]But if you want to take it out on me, go ahead.
[08:33.09]All I desire is a duel with you.
[08:36.49]Desire level 100%.
[08:38.93]Revenge on primary target was previously accomplished.
[08:42.56]Behold!
[08:43.90]Same dramatically.
[08:45.38]So Henry makes a cameo.
[08:47.64]Before fighting you, I elected to
[08:51.97]What does this shirt say?
[08:54.03]I love that saver.
[08:55.71]We actually do have to fight him.
[09:26.75]Is it gonna be a maze?
[09:34.58]I hope not.
[09:38.20]Shit, we have to actually fight it.
[09:43.36]I thought it was gonna be another joke.
[09:45.65]Let's go!
[09:48.67]What happens to the floor?
[10:00.28]Okay, that hurt a lot.
[10:01.30]That almost instantly killed me.
[10:03.48]Uh, alright.
[10:06.82]Oh, this is safe.
[10:07.52]This is a safe spot.
[10:08.52]Okay, I get it.
[10:09.18]The ones that don't move.
[10:17.65]Come here!
[10:20.73]Oh, shit.
[10:23.17]I gotta go get on that one?
[10:29.90]Do I wait for him to move?
[10:31.20]Wait for him to move.
[10:31.98]Where you going?
[10:38.24]Oh shit, this is not gonna work out, is it?
[10:41.88]Is it?
[10:44.34]Holy shit, this thing is powerful.
[10:52.91]Okay, easy, easy, easy.
[10:54.09]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[10:55.03]Find a good spot to stand.
[10:57.72]Where, where, where, where, where?
[10:59.14]Right here.
[11:01.62]Oh!
[11:02.82]Okay, wait for him to move.
[11:05.22]Wait for him to move.
[11:10.75]What's this?
[11:11.17]What's that?
[11:13.93]Jesus!
[11:14.49]Okay, that's a... I can dodge that, I think.
[11:17.05]It says I don't like this.
[11:22.93]I don't like the extreme explosive noise that pops up.
[11:28.58]Come here.
[11:33.00]I can... I'm safe right next to him.
[11:36.34]Yes!
[11:41.95]Alright, this ain't so bad.
[11:42.79]This ain't so bad.
[11:43.28]Just don't be an idiot.
[11:44.02]Nice.
[11:47.74]Okay.
[11:48.54]Easy.
[11:49.26]Wait.
[11:50.06]Okay.
[11:55.02]Oh god.
[12:04.67]Oh god.
[12:08.53]It's not safe.
[12:15.88]Oh, it hit me in the face.
[12:18.44]That wasn't safe.
[12:19.34]It got like the corner of my mouth.
[12:24.08]Oh, fuck.
[12:24.60]Did I dodge it?
[12:25.16]I think so.
[12:25.69]I don't know.
[12:26.01]Oh.
[12:36.06]He sliced off my nose?
[12:37.52]Let's just move!
[12:41.21]Let's just move!
[12:44.41]Where's he going?
[12:49.03]Oh god.
[12:50.88]Oh god.
[12:52.98]I know I say it a lot, okay?
[12:55.88]Is it safe here?
[12:56.54]I need that health.
[13:06.81]Alright, where's the health?
[13:10.83]There's a health box.
[13:16.02]It's the same, no!
[13:17.10]Don't move!
[13:21.54]Fine.
[13:29.42]Oh my god!
[13:32.35]I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[13:36.60]I'm not okay.
[13:38.02]Shake everything!
[13:38.78]Shake everything, right?
[13:42.42]Okay, good.
[13:44.82]No!
[13:45.06]How are you missing?
[13:50.08]What?
[13:52.32]Okay, I'm fine.
[13:59.71]Ooh, he tried to hit me with a dive.
[14:02.97]Can't make it..
[14:08.10]It's so hard to determine, man.
[14:10.12]It's so scary.
[14:11.20]Alright, is he gonna move?
[14:14.16]Alright, I'm good.
[14:25.95]Bang.
[14:28.39]Get!
[14:29.46]Nope.
[14:29.88]Easy.
[14:39.54]um I'm too scared I'm terrified of that alright he's gonna fly forward where's he going nope he's gonna do do it right there
[15:08.84]Again?
[15:09.08]Again?
[15:10.50]Alright, one more time.
[15:15.00]Don't move.
[15:16.24]Is he gone?
[15:18.61]This is it, I win.
[15:42.98]Game over.
[15:43.38]Boss dead.
[15:43.92]This is a scary one.
[15:48.86]Scary one.
[15:52.94]What were those disgusting sounds?
[15:55.90]That was just me opening my mouth and closing it to talk.
[16:01.49]Ah!
[16:01.61]That just didn't do it.
[16:08.95]Pin!
[16:22.10]What is it?
[16:22.46]Okay, I don't even know the origin of this.
[16:24.06]I don't even know what this is.
[16:26.44]But I've seen it.
[16:27.46]Okay, it kind of worked, I guess.
[16:49.94]Master?
[16:51.34]It's been a long time.
[16:53.27]Shinobu?
[16:54.63]How did... Wait, what did you say?
[16:57.27]Did you call me master?
[16:59.49]I don't have time for apprentices.
[17:01.37]You have any idea how much pro wrestling is backlogged on my VCR?
[17:06.17]I came to tell you I got back safely from Asia.
[17:08.69]You should be happy.
[17:09.63]I didn't even know you left.
[17:12.21]Are you listening?
[17:14.21]I'm not your master.
[17:17.10]My only desire was to become strong like you, master.
[17:20.52]So I trained hard, and I fought to become the champion of Asia.
[17:24.60]Here's my belt.
[17:26.60]No way.
[17:27.60]You won this?
[17:28.98]That's pretty badass.
[17:30.90]When I get married, I'm not getting a ring.
[17:33.20]No.
[17:33.46]I'm getting a championship belt that you have to wear forever.
[17:37.65]Overburdened?
[17:38.85]Who told you that?
[17:40.95]Sylvia.
[17:42.09]She said I should come back and help you.
[17:44.85]What?
[17:45.73]Who's that bitch think she is, my nanny?
[17:48.59]Listen up, Shinobu.
[17:49.97]This is my war.
[17:51.29]I don't need help from anybody.
[17:53.63]Well, the thing is, it's kind of too late for that.
[17:57.68]Huh?
[17:58.72]What are you talking about?
[18:00.90]With her arm gone, yeah.
[18:02.04]I'll explain later, master.
[18:03.86]But you should go to the bathroom first.
[18:05.96]Seriously, it's a long story.
[18:08.20]Ugh, we're gonna get a lore dump.
[18:10.14]But I'm not your goddamn master.
[18:15.41]Gonna get a lore dump.
[18:26.91]Oh, we went from 23 to 10.
[18:28.09]Looks like we skipped a few.
[18:36.75]Ah yes, it's that time again.
[18:37.73]It's time to activate the one guy squad and tell them to play God Hand.
[18:42.14]Did you pay attention?
[18:42.82]No.
[18:43.14]Not at all.
[18:45.48]Uh, sorry.
[18:46.33]Somebody says it about God Hand.
[18:54.57]Yeah, I'll play it.
[18:55.85]July 30th or something.
[18:58.19]Something, something.
[18:58.87]July 30th.
[19:01.87]Sorry for interrupting your time abroad, but will you fight for Travis?
[19:08.19]Sure.
[19:09.29]I'm eager to kill, so hurry with the details.
[19:12.49]Straight to the point.
[19:13.90]I like that.
[19:15.14]Can you handle two of our top ten?
[19:17.16]Two?
[19:17.96]Only two?
[19:19.04]That's nothing.
[19:20.38]Why don't I just take them all?
[19:22.60]You've grown confident.
[19:25.44]Yeah, but not overconfident.
[19:28.28]Unlike you, I can see myself objectively.
[19:31.87]Easy bake never.
[19:34.11]Don't forget your promise.
[19:35.11]It's happening on like the 15th, 14th, whatever.
[19:37.65]And you're dead.
[19:38.15]What are you talking about?
[19:39.71]I already gave you a hard date for that.
[19:43.55]You're not worth the stain on my blade.
[19:47.69]That's just bad steel.
[19:52.54]Staining your blade?
[19:54.74]You must not have a fucking Cathy Mitchell copper pot.
[19:58.29]Wait, I have to play as her.
[20:06.50]Jump.
[20:08.18]Hold A then release.
[20:09.04]Long range.
[20:10.40]Press A while jumping.
[20:11.28]Jump attack.
[20:12.26]Press B while jumping.
[20:13.14]Flying attack.
[20:15.40]Oh, they've added a jump.
[20:17.08]That's all it took.
[20:21.45]Let's do a long range attack.
[20:25.68]Well, that was fucking awesome.
[20:27.24]Can I play with this character the rest of the game?
[20:36.50]Whoa!
[20:37.33]I took cash from the toilet!
[20:49.03]Ball F. It's emulated.
[20:55.40]Shut up!
[20:56.71]Uh, small F, that's my fault.
[20:58.61]Don't worry, it's always my fault.
[21:00.97]Just blame me for everything.
[21:08.12]Holy shit, that was good.
[21:09.50]Dude, these quick slashes!
[21:12.34]Oh!
[21:17.61]I mean, yeah, I got a VPN.
[21:19.55]I'm on a VPN, so... It makes sense.
[21:23.09]Don't worry.
[21:25.35]It ain't gonna... This stream ain't gonna... It's not gonna, like, turn off.
[21:28.59]It's not gonna fucking lose, like, 10,000 frames.
[21:31.58]It's just... I'm going through a... If you haven't heard of the term... It's called a VPN.
[21:36.82]V-E-E-P-I-A-N.
[21:38.36]VPN.
[21:39.26]VPN.
[21:46.28]designed to help with, like, traffic flow and... Where is this other person?
[21:57.30]Where is this person?
[22:00.54]Oh, there you are.
[22:01.14]Can't go through the window?
[22:02.88]Damn it!
[22:03.78]Alright, I'm going.
[22:15.13]Long range, right?
[22:15.75]Let's go.
[22:16.03]I want to do it.
[22:16.92]I'll do it.
[22:17.40]This move is cool.
[22:17.92]There it is.
[22:43.94]What is she saying?
[22:44.80]You have no Moe?
[22:50.52]Are you fucking with me?
[22:55.90]Moe.
[22:56.70]Oh, it's Moe.
[22:59.24]Where's this last guy?
[23:00.06]Oh, there's a chest over here.
[23:09.40]Apologize.
[23:10.08]You're saying Moe.
[23:12.54]Is that a word that nobody wants me to say?
[23:14.17]Is that added to the banned list of words that streamer can't say?
[23:18.35]I bet you are.
[23:21.41]Wait, you just were here but now you're not here.
[23:25.73]You just were here but now you're not here.
[23:27.49]There you are.
[23:30.57]You're nowhere close to master.
[23:48.72]Meester.
[23:49.12]You're not even close to meester.
[23:55.54]Holy shit, that was loud.
[24:02.83]This is like every roommate scenario when they're playing Counter-Strike and you can hear them through the wall.
[24:16.59]Like, dude, settle down, man.
[24:18.15]Dude, he's kicking my ass.
[24:21.13]Dude!
[24:21.67]God!
[24:44.63]Kano wins.
[24:59.80]This fucking screen.
[25:01.54]It's like, dude, just... I know, input lag sucks.
[25:04.66]That's why I don't play online video games that have precise inputs because it's like a quarter of a second delay.
[25:13.27]That's why I don't play them.
[25:25.03]People just keep spawning.
[25:34.94]I'm gonna get some blocks in here.
[25:38.24]That was sick.
[25:39.54]Careful.
[25:40.52]You need more practice.
[25:52.03]Alright, long range.
[25:53.63]Bingo!
[25:54.73]Here comes a bingo!
[25:55.23]Dude, I was listening to your stream when you were playing No More Heroes 2, and you did this thing where you said, bingo, bingo, and I fucking hated it and I flinched out of my seat.
[26:03.80]See you next week when somebody sends that as a message.
[26:06.25]What's going on with the voice here?
[26:07.13]That was weird.
[26:22.53]Somebody was in the middle of typing it, I'm sure.
[26:24.49]Well, this looks fun.
[26:26.21]Sneak through.
[26:26.63]That was easy.
[26:32.47]She had another weapon?
[26:44.93]Just one weapon?
[26:45.75]I have to go one weapon.
[26:47.82]The one-time thing, so no.
[26:49.26]Fuck.
[26:51.66]Fuck it!
[27:10.62]There's money in here?
[27:22.71]Holy shit.
[27:25.63]That's a lot of money.
[27:29.63]Alright, watch it.
[27:31.81]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[27:38.72]That was a chainsaw guy.
[27:41.08]Don't even let him... Oh my god, I tried to dodge.
[27:45.50]Alright, back up.
[27:50.07]Stop taunting!
[27:51.65]She gets up and goes, you have no moe, and I can't control her.
[28:11.10]Whoa!
[28:13.04]Whoa!
[28:40.88]She says that every time, huh?
[28:45.02]You have no moe.
[28:50.52]Kill.
[28:55.90]Apologize.
[28:56.60]What's it mean?
[28:59.44]What's it mean?
[29:00.42]What does that mean when I say that?
[29:02.42]What is moe?
[29:06.22]What's the word mean?
[29:13.25]It means you're not cute?
[29:17.78]The anime term for cuteness.
[29:19.36]I thought that was kawaii.
[29:23.56]I thought kawaii was an anime cute word.
[29:30.77]Same thing.
[29:33.03]Oh, so what would make somebody say moe over kawaii?
[29:41.26]What does Kawaii have that Moe doesn't?
[29:44.62]Or the other way around?
[29:48.58]Can I jump off this?
[29:53.07]I have no idea.
[29:53.87]Okay.
[29:55.13]Thanks for the help, guys.
[29:58.71]I can rely on you.
[30:00.55]Fucking anime terms.
[30:11.14]Come on, get it.
[30:13.72]No!
[30:18.34]Is this a Reddit chat?
[30:23.00]I don't think it is, unless you're all pretending to hate it.
[30:37.01]Unless you guys really actually love that site and you're pretending to hate it.
[30:41.66]Okay, I can't lock on to that.
[30:45.46]Uh, where can I go?
[30:47.04]Over there?
[30:50.02]Oh, that sucks.
[30:50.63]Is there another way to get up there?
[31:00.75]Huh.
[31:08.88]Okay.
[31:10.02]Yeah, I just... Apparently just didn't do it good enough.
[31:16.81]Just didn't do a good enough job.
[31:18.17]Just don't.
[31:19.21]Please.
[31:19.49]Can somebody learn from Gacha Force and have the camera be in the right place?
[31:23.43]Gacha Force did it.
[31:24.19]Why can't everybody else do it?
[31:32.40]Well, I... How did you miss?
[31:34.64]Okay.
[31:37.32]Do I actually have to make this jump?
[31:38.64]I'm not gonna make it.
[31:42.36]I told you.
[31:43.00]Like, I wasn't gonna- It's weird.
[31:44.14]It's fucking weird.
[31:45.16]It's like a fucked up weird- I told you.
[31:47.80]It's odd.
[31:50.06]It does- It- It's- Okay, I feel like I'm crouch jumping in the Source Engine.
[31:54.40]That's how this feels.
[32:14.12]God, okay.
[32:15.22]Where's the last one?
[32:27.85]Oh, I see it.
[32:28.39]I see it!
[32:28.83]I see it!
[32:29.29]I see it!
[32:40.82]I can't.
[32:41.12]Oh, this is going to be in the ass.
[32:43.92]I already said anime sucks.
[32:56.21]Whatever.
[32:58.07]I'm not even going to address that.
[33:02.12]Unbelievable.
[33:03.60]I'm not even going to fucking address that.
[33:12.77]If you're going to the bathroom in the shower, this is like the go to the bathroom save point.
[33:19.60]Wait.
[33:21.34]She showers and he shits.
[33:28.13]How come he never takes a bath?
[33:30.59]Hey, thanks Ben for the five community subs, appreciate it.
[33:36.25]Five subs from Ben Eldor.
[33:38.77]Is he Ben?
[33:41.52]Welcome to the Jermamites.
[33:44.49]No, actually, I get that.
[33:45.97]I screw up the way that I say that usually the first or second time.
[33:48.35]I did it right that first time.
[33:49.37]I feel like I'm going to hate this fight.
[34:00.74]Golden gun.
[34:12.53]If you kill me, you can fight Travis.
[34:15.23]But that's a huge itch.
[34:17.33]You talk a lot of trash.
[34:19.15]For a child.
[34:21.33]Let's get to the fun.
[34:22.69]Done.
[34:24.05]Okay.
[34:26.21]I'm not going easy on you just because you're a girl.
[34:33.00]Wait.
[34:33.32]I wanted to fight you.
[34:35.70]Now what?
[34:36.68]Where is he?
[34:41.38]I'm not going to go easy on you just because I have you I'm not going to you
[35:07.49]I'm not done yet.
[35:08.43]Oh, fuck.
[35:31.49]Alright, spring it together.
[35:33.51]Block it!
[35:34.49]Fuck!
[35:35.99]Fuck you!
[35:39.01]Why does everybody say fuck?
[35:47.72]Block it.
[35:48.22]Oh!
[36:02.30]Walk, walk, walk, walk.
[36:04.92]How many does it shoot?
[36:05.48]It shoots one, two, three, four, five.
[36:07.06]Why can't I walk up the stairs?
[36:12.17]Hey!
[36:18.25]Damn it!
[36:18.63]Fuck you!
[36:19.95]I'm not going to go easy on you.
[36:21.39]You're a drug.
[36:35.63]This guy's nuts.
[36:37.52]Oh, fucking platforming.
[36:40.61]Oh, this is not designed.
[36:42.29]This game wasn't made for this.
[36:52.84]I knew I was gonna not like this part.
[36:56.32]I'm not gonna go easy on you.
[37:00.58]He's freaking me out.
[37:01.72]How did I not make that jump?
[37:06.08]I'm just swearing.
[37:09.25]Alright, it's one, two, three, go up.
[37:23.96]Pick the fucking thing up, man.
[37:35.34]Where?
[37:35.66]I don't even know where I can stare at the camera.
[37:41.32]Did you say money?
[37:44.18]I love money.
[37:47.10]Is he below me?
[37:51.14]Okay, block.
[37:57.53]How am I not blocking?
[37:59.85]Oh, that's right.
[38:00.21]She taunts after every attack.
[38:01.47]I forgot.
[38:05.02]Okay, hard job.
[38:38.84]What are you not going to do?
[38:39.84]Oh, don't jump over him!
[38:47.53]This motherfucker can dodge better than anybody!
[38:56.13]Why is it not blocking?!
[39:00.61]I'm ho- I'm hella- I'm blocking up!
[39:03.96]What the fuck are you doing?
[39:09.04]Fuck!
[39:10.26]Fuck!

[39:17.34]Kill!
[39:17.80]Kill!
[39:18.24]Fuck!
[39:36.58]What the fuck?
[39:37.89]Why did I not block the other ones?
[39:47.25]Where is he?
[39:47.59]Did you?
[40:07.21]You don't have anything else but two voice lines?
[40:09.64]Where even is this dude?
[40:11.48]He's down here?
[40:21.22]Okay.
[40:22.87]It's what?
[40:23.53]Seven shots?
[40:24.31]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[40:25.37]I'm down.
[40:25.69]One, two, three, four.
[40:29.27]I don't even have a 50% health, man.
[40:30.43]Tell him it's trouble.
[40:47.28]Try to get in front of it.
[40:51.02]Don't even let him shoot!
[40:51.82]Don't let him shoot!
[40:52.30]Don't let him shoot!
[40:54.25]Don't let him shoot a gun!
[40:56.27]Fine!
[40:59.39]Don't even let him shoot the gun!
[41:02.35]Suplex him!
[41:03.72]But you don't have any moves!
[41:15.10]She doesn't watch wrestling.
[41:18.92]Really?
[41:19.26]Okay, I know the strategy.
[41:23.66]It's just don't let him attack.
[41:24.70]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[41:32.76]She won the championship belt.
[41:34.02]She should know.
[41:34.52]No.
[41:43.21]Okay, we got this in the bag.
[41:48.18]Don't let him get any shots off.
[41:49.66]Alright, get up there quick so I can... Okay.
[41:55.70]What?
[41:56.70]I... You have to fucking wonder.
[41:59.19]You have to wonder!
[42:02.15]You have to take into consideration the fact that this... I... Why?
[42:14.25]No, don't eat that pizza.
[42:19.39]I better not get hit.
[42:21.23]Oh my fucking god.
[42:22.19]You gotta be kidding me.
[42:24.23]Don't let him shoot.
[42:38.50]Don't let him!
[42:39.40]Don't let him!
[42:46.36]What do you think you're gonna shoot?
[42:50.90]Yeah, he's stuck.
[42:52.66]He's stuck.
[42:53.20]He wants to shoot me so bad, but he's not going to ever.
[42:56.88]He's not gonna... Don't let him shoot you.
[43:06.22]Don't let him do it.
[43:07.60]Oh, we almost did.
[43:11.85]He's so confident.
[43:14.19]He's knocking.
[43:14.61]I cheese.
[43:16.03]I cheese.
[43:17.81]Spread it.
[43:21.07]You don't know anything about wrestling, I guess.
[43:26.70]No.
[43:32.26]I broke him out of his spell.
[43:39.58]Store up.
[43:41.96]Store up.
[43:51.68]Another Counter-Strike roommate.
[44:00.27]No more heroes, too.
[44:02.77]Desperate Counter-Strike.
[44:13.96]That was way easier than I thought it would be.
[44:20.26]No moe heroes.
[44:28.06]Any last words?
[44:30.08]Just give me your name.
[44:36.83]When the gatekeeper to hell asks who sent you, tell him it was Shinobu Jacobs.
[44:42.26]Can't talk.
[44:49.14]Come on.
[44:52.26]How are you speaking?
[44:54.34]That's not how that works.
[45:11.70]laughing my ass off.
[45:22.15]What?
[45:27.04]Yeah, that's what I asked.
[45:30.08]She doesn't even know what it means.
[45:39.84]He says it every five seconds and you don't even know what it is.
[45:41.84]That's so funny.
[45:53.37]Who's this?
[45:59.15]Were you friends?
[46:00.19]Yes.
[46:01.07]We never met in person, but we knew each other well.
[46:04.99]We exchanged many letters, even though our countries and languages were different.
[46:11.22]That's like a fucking knife on his back.
[46:13.46]That's a big, huge sword.
[46:15.44]I am very much indebted to him.
[46:17.98]He gave me courage.
[46:21.05]Oh, I'm just rambling.
[46:23.21]Don't mind me.
[46:24.87]That looks like a type of shitty luggage you'd buy on SkyMall trying to save space.
[46:33.30]It fits under the- IT FITS UNDER THE SEAT!
[47:01.52]yeah shinobu the next match is ready on my way this better be good wait is this the match the rocket launcher I wonder what it is
[47:28.40]Oh, outdoor.
[47:30.40]Outdoor zone.
[47:31.56]What you got there?
[47:34.78]I didn't see the second guy.
[47:44.05]You thought it was just one guy.
[47:45.99]Wait.
[47:47.09]Secret!
[47:56.31]Can I get up there?
[47:57.65]Or is it... Do I eventually get over there?
[48:00.05]I think I eventually get over there.
[48:02.75]Okay.
[48:09.22]On the ground.
[48:15.28]Kill now.
[48:23.77]Why did he walk like the Heavy?
[48:26.69]What do you mean?
[48:32.31]Both of us will have trouble.
[48:34.44]Attack!
[48:51.77]Forward!
[48:57.30]Kill!
[48:57.82]Yes!
[48:59.86]This ridiculously high streamer can't even do a Tetris puzzle.
[49:03.08]That was fucking yesterday.
[49:06.21]I haven't even opened up Tetris this whole game.
[49:09.23]What am I talking about?
[49:22.86]I thought I could kill him before he got out of the car.
[49:32.03]Now that would have been epic.
[49:39.78]Everybody's so vulgar.
[49:44.80]Everybody just screams fuck.
[49:52.01]When are you gonna do a cigarette smoking stream?
[49:57.07]What, I just sit there and smoke?
[50:04.61]What the fuck would the point of that be?
[50:07.16]I don't even know you-
[50:19.84]There's no reason why I would smoke on stream, let alone smoke in real life.
[50:32.23]Another carload of people?
[50:37.35]I'm gonna smoke every brand of cigarettes and let us know what the best one is.
[50:48.14]A guy that's never smoked cigarettes before in his life.
[50:58.63]You want to do a cigarette smoking first time impressions channel.
[51:05.37]Like guys, I'm not going to... This is not opening Breath of the Wild for 10 minutes and then writing a review about it.
[51:13.35]That's not how this is going to work.
[51:18.03]Because then I'll get addicted to smoking cigarettes.
[51:22.85]I don't want to smoke cigarettes.
[51:24.71]That shit's gross.
[51:28.91]Do it.
[51:31.37]You gotta be cool.
[51:47.26]No, sorry.
[51:47.74]The only thing I think is fucking cool is the McDLT dance.
[51:52.08]Nothing else is cool.
[51:52.90]I'm sorry.
[51:53.52]You're wrong.
[51:56.83]Okay, boomer.
[52:06.63]Wouldn't the boomer be the one that had the cigarette in his mouth right now?
[52:11.90]Me having a don't smoke stance.
[52:15.06]Wait, how is...
[52:22.30]Guys, you would know I was a boomer if I... I would be smoking in my house right now.
[52:32.77]Like cigarettes in the house.
[52:36.85]I'm like, oh no, I'm gonna step outside.
[52:39.01]No, no, no, no.
[52:39.53]I smoke in my office.
[52:46.38]There's no facecam to prove that you aren't smoking.
[52:48.62]I'm not.
[52:55.66]Wait till he stands up.
[52:58.20]Make it embarrassing.
[53:04.38]Uh, that missed a lot of money.
[53:06.15]Can I go over here?
[53:11.37]Is there the, uh... Look at those chests.
[53:14.91]Do I eventually get up there?
[53:15.81]I don't want to miss the chests.
[53:27.95]I wrap around him.
[53:32.01]Are you prepared, hell?
[53:34.90]Are you prepared, hell?
[53:37.06]Are you prepared, hell?
[53:47.75]Alright, here we go.
[53:53.13]Over this way.
[53:56.18]I'm wearing heels, stupid!
[53:57.35]Okay, where are those, uh...
[54:29.75]I gotta go pick up all the junk over here.
[54:36.51]Is it on top?
[54:37.39]Where are these two?
[54:39.61]Where are these two?
[54:41.75]Oh!
[54:52.74]Sure I am.
[54:54.00]What are you gonna do about it?
[54:58.76]These guys are freaking me the fuck out.
[55:00.50]I'm just gonna go.
[55:02.50]Wait, no.
[55:02.78]I gotta go down every hall.
[55:04.17]Oh, this is gonna be a pain in the ass, but I have to do it.
[55:13.31]There's money in these.
[55:21.64]I can't tell if that's faster or slower.
[55:23.22]It's probably slower.
[55:26.30]Charge is a... Charge is...
[55:29.61]Oh, fuck.
[55:30.57]That's awesome.
[55:31.41]Thank God he told me that.
[55:39.07]Cash, good.
[55:40.01]Ooh, snitched.
[55:45.41]Look, that makes all of our lives easier.
[55:47.61]Because I don't sit here for more than, like, more time than I need to.
[55:54.21]What do you mean, snitched?
[56:00.56]Can I get that from here?
[56:14.28]Please don't tell me I have to kill those guys, do I?
[56:15.86]Do I have to kill those guys?
[56:18.56]Yeah, I gotta kill those two guys.
[56:20.38]Now we're standing.
[56:25.59]Yeah.
[56:28.43]Yeah, I do.
[56:32.29]Don't smoke.
[56:32.93]Stop.
[56:33.17]Why would you smoke?
[56:34.81]Why smoke?
[56:35.35]Don't do that.
[56:35.79]What are you talking about?
[56:36.79]Don't smoke.
[56:42.99]Okay.
[56:46.78]Oh, I can go.
[56:52.74]You smoked CBD oil.
[56:54.92]No, I didn't.
[57:07.66]Sorry, the proper use is a tincture?
[57:10.50]A tincture?
[57:13.94]Tincture?
[57:14.36]Okay, this is where we go.
[57:27.21]This game is so bad.
[57:29.41]Like, did anybody play this?
[57:33.31]When they were in the middle of making...
[57:48.08]Wait, now I'm back... No, go over here.
[57:55.55]Wait, now I'm turned around.
[57:56.73]Wait, what?
[57:59.95]Is this the right way?
[58:00.83]It's all the same fucking car.
[58:11.93]Oh my goodness gracious.
[58:26.66]That's the reason why Legend of Zelda never had a fucking jump.
[58:30.35]It would be this awful.
[58:31.37]Dude, like, let me walk across the board.
[58:41.71]It's this camera.
[58:44.64]Stuff changing.
[58:45.68]They're like going.
[58:48.30]Holy shit.
[58:49.00]Jesus.
[58:59.19]I can't do an attack without falling off the fucking roof.
[59:20.85]Shinobi levels are low-key awful.
[59:24.45]Uh, I mean high-key.
[59:27.11]Like, sing it as high to pitch as you can.
[59:29.17]Like, see?
[59:31.09]Like, I'm just trying to walk fucking straight.
[59:35.02]Like, what the fuck?

[59:53.44]Oh my fucking god.
[60:03.43]Like, this is like high-pitched Break the Windows high-key awful.
[60:07.78]Not low-key.
[60:09.24]Low-key would be... No, this is like...
[60:25.42]Where the fuck am I going?
[60:26.88]Why did I go this far?
[60:28.06]I can't wait till I get the jump deleted from the game.
[60:41.67]That happens like immediately after this is over, right?
[60:46.01]And we never have to do this again.
[60:48.59]Like, I mean like instantly.
[60:52.31]We don't get a jump, right?
[60:53.15]Ever again?
[61:03.89]Okay, let's walk across the bridge.
[61:10.21]Okay, please.
[61:19.20]Like, shift the camera.
[61:31.43]Don't go off the edge, I'll be so bad Don't Jesus
[62:07.36]Turn another bridge don't fucking fall off Okay, no no no no no no no no no no it is it is it is Un-fucking-bearable.
[62:22.22]Holy shit.
[62:24.36]Oh my god
[62:35.47]Can I jump up from here?
[62:37.19]Where do I go?
[62:37.81]This way, right?
[62:48.36]Is it over here?
[62:48.92]Where the hell is it?
[62:52.70]I'm on the other side.
[62:54.98]It's right fucking here.
[62:56.17]Ugh.
[63:05.60]How do I forget?
[63:06.26]I'm not forget- I'm just insanely angry.
[63:09.36]Holy shit.
[63:25.70]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[63:34.79]This is harder than crouch jumping in the fucking source engine Dude, stop
[64:05.85]Oh my god, this thing.
[64:07.87]What a fucking journey to cross a bridge.
[64:11.63]Okay.
[64:13.73]I can't turn the camera.
[64:15.86]And even in the tiniest little movements make you fucking go frantic in this game.
[64:21.54]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[64:23.60]They're deliberately trying to make me fall.
[64:26.49]Lakitu, get on it.
[64:27.85]What are you doing?
[64:40.11]Don't even go over there!
[64:56.56]Can we fucking fight somewhere else besides the edge?
[64:59.12]I don't want to fight on the edge.
[65:02.14]The edges guaranteed fall off the fucking edge.
[65:06.58]Okay.
[65:06.96]Don't move.
[65:29.82]Is that chest?
[65:31.76]Wait, is that bridge over here?
[65:33.10]No, no, no, no.
[65:34.12]Don't do this again.
[65:34.76]Okay, I gotta just jump over here.
[65:55.75]I almost didn't make it.
[65:57.57]I almost didn't make it.
[66:05.18]Oh my god.
[66:06.20]I don't want to be facing like this.
[66:08.52]It's gonna happen.
[66:10.30]I'm gonna be so slow.
[66:11.38]You have no idea.
[66:12.14]Let's just hug the fucking wall.
[66:22.93]Okay, we're good.
[66:24.95]Holy shit, that sucked!
[66:28.23]Suda!
[66:29.61]What the hell was that?
[66:31.21]Suda!
[66:32.29]Suda wasn't in on this one.
[66:50.25]to direct this one.
[66:52.47]Oh.
[66:52.63]So this is the Dark Souls 2 of the franchise?
[67:04.18]Oh.
[67:05.10]Well, that's alright.
[67:06.28]It's still fun.
[67:07.60]I still like it.
[67:08.18]I just don't like this part.
[67:10.97]I don't like the jump.
[67:12.93]Jump?
[67:13.31]I don't like it.
[67:14.27]Send it back.
[67:15.59]Send it back.
[67:16.89]Return it.
[67:20.51]Dark Souls 2 is good.
[67:21.85]I didn't say it was bad.
[67:23.21]I just said it was the Dark Souls 2 of the game.
[67:30.77]Dark Souls 2 also was not made by the same director, right?
[67:35.66]He kind of took a little hands-off approach, right?
[67:37.70]From what I remember.
[67:40.30]Why does he hate this?
[67:43.94]Am I supposed to be doing this right now?
[67:48.27]I'd love to look down there.
[67:55.39]Press the C button.
[67:58.50]Yeah, that just spins the camera.
[68:04.68]Yeah, if I was doing that on the bridge, that'd be bad.
[68:06.44]It would rip the camera.
[68:08.36]Then I would walk the wrong direction for a tenth of a second and fall off the bridge.
[68:21.69]Another one here?
[68:27.09]There's probably another one right here somewhere.
[68:38.86]Wait, is this a truck stop bathroom?
[68:40.46]Why does it look like this?
[68:41.20]This is like the nicest random warehouse bathroom ever.
[69:05.27]Alright, let's go.
[69:11.17]Why doesn't she shit?
[69:12.11]I don't know.
[69:16.23]Why do you want that to happen?
[69:24.74]Why do you want anybody to shit on camera?
[69:28.92]What do we have here?
[69:30.56]A young lady?
[69:32.40]You know, it's dangerous coming to a place like this alone.
[69:36.41]You ought to be more careful.
[69:37.59]Seriously, terrible things can happen.
[69:40.71]I see it on the news all the time.
[69:45.11]Maybe that's why she came.
[69:47.11]It's what she wants.
[69:49.13]Two grown men to keep her company.
[69:54.16]Horny slut.
[69:55.28]My master's got his hands full, so I'm taking his place.
[69:58.78]Not that it matters.
[70:00.22]The result's gonna be the same.
[70:02.40]I don't have time for this.
[70:03.54]You're taking Travis's place?
[70:06.00]Wow.
[70:07.05]I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty disrespected.
[70:08.97]Just shut up and fight.
[70:10.17]Oh, listen to this whore.
[70:12.26]Acting like she's some kind of femme fatale.
[70:14.86]Shut up and fight, she says.
[70:16.42]She's really pissing me off.
[70:18.48]Seriously.
[70:19.35]And she's so rude.
[70:21.07]Reminds me of my complaining customers.
[70:22.81]Now, Travis, he knew how to fight like a gentleman.
[70:26.87]Sliced me in half, sure, but he did it with grace.
[70:29.63]I mean, come on.
[70:31.44]Put her there.
[70:31.86]Don't do it.
[70:33.40]You know, let's shake hands.
[70:35.90]sportsmanship is paramount to a fair and clean fight hurry up and shake dirty nympho whatever but which one it doesn't matter your choice destroy spark what the what was this supposed to spark
[71:07.81]I'd rather have to fight two at the same time.
[71:09.25]This is going to be terrible.
[71:09.99]Oh boy.
[71:10.17]And his jumping involved.
[71:10.93]Oh, he's already mad about it.
[71:12.11]Watch it.

[71:52.76]What's it floating?
[71:53.62]Wait, I'm just going to focus on one?
[72:11.65]Destroy Spark behind him.
[72:25.42]Alright, go get that one.
[72:28.02]No, just fight this one, I guess.
[72:35.66]The other guy's just raining hell on me.

[77:21.28]Hey!
[77:25.00]What is this?
[77:25.62]Did he just revive him?
[77:30.92]Wait a second!
[77:35.51]They both have to die at the same time?
[77:42.47]Are you kidding me?
[77:43.21]They have to die at the same time?
[77:46.69]No... Now I have to... That's so unfortunate.
[78:12.71]There's health up here.
[78:15.57]There's health up here.
[78:16.83]If only I could get it.
[78:19.03]I'm not going to make it to the pizza.
[78:34.46]Do I got anyone left in me?

[78:45.22]Oh my goodness.
[78:51.42]Okay.
[78:52.78]Well, I don't... I have to... They both have to die within, like, the saving moment.
[79:24.56]Why soy beans?
[79:27.78]That's not what he's saying.
[79:32.75]That's what you deserve.
[79:34.37]You deserve that.
[79:46.24]Stop it!
[79:57.45]I was away!
[79:59.97]I'm trying to dodge backwards!
[80:17.10]I'm trying to get you to stay out of the way of all his attacks.
[80:20.14]Alright, hit him right in the fucking head.
[80:37.84]WHAT?
[80:39.10]AHH!
[80:42.69]You're just doing destroy beam the whole time.
[80:45.29]Get that shit, get that smash from this bullshit tactic out of here.
[80:51.25]Playing at Hyrule Castle, a fucking person playing as Samus just sits there and presses standard beam across the map and doesn't even play the game.
[81:00.60]You've refreshed Twitter more than you've played.
[81:02.44]This is getting fucked up.
[81:28.55]Don't let him do it!
[81:30.51]Can I interrupt this?
[81:36.11]Oh my god, oh my god!
[81:36.99]I don't think I can.
[81:37.63]Can I interrupt it?
[81:44.32]Alright, I need the health.
[81:51.10]I need health 1.
[81:51.70]You seriously just spin around and hit me with that?
[81:57.47]That's next level homing missile, dude.
[81:59.85]Come on.
[82:01.16]What the fuck?
[82:10.92]Oh, come on.
[82:14.65]What the fuck, man?
[82:20.91]I can't even get the fuck out of here.
[82:23.59]I'm gonna die from this.
[82:26.27]Alright, where's the- where is it?
[82:33.49]Give me that fucking pizza.
[82:36.83]I don't even think about it.
[82:38.95]You fucking asshole.
[82:54.68]Alright.
[83:00.57]Oh my god.
[83:08.23]Is it safe back here?
[83:09.37]Is it safe right here?
[83:18.09]Hey.
[83:19.71]Holy shit, it hit him.
[83:20.43]It hit him.
[83:21.91]It hit this guy.
[83:23.21]Alright, kill this guy and then spawn camp his body.
[83:40.26]Nice!
[83:53.53]Don't let it go!
[83:54.07]Alright, what are you gonna do?
[83:57.75]You gonna land?
[83:58.23]I don't think so, motherfucker!
[84:02.42]Hey!
[84:06.46]Don't!
[84:09.22]Get outta here!
[84:11.24]You're not gonna revive this guy?
[84:13.26]No, you're not!
[84:13.82]I'm not gonna let you do it.
[84:18.92]Not gonna happen.
[84:23.37]What's that?
[84:32.13]Don't let him revive him!
[84:33.05]No!
[84:33.59]No!
[84:34.59]Don't do it, please!
[84:36.17]No!
[84:38.11]That thing was homing for like 30 straight seconds!
[84:45.38]How long can you have a device follow you the fuck around?
[84:49.44]I've gotta kill him before they get this off!
[85:04.49]Dude, I don't... What the fuck is happening in this fight?
[85:21.76]Holy shit, I'm gonna fucking cry.
[85:24.36]This is horrible.
[85:30.64]Come here.
[85:33.27]Shoot a fucking homing bomb out.
[85:36.15]Why?
[85:37.35]Why does it take you so long to finish that animation?
[85:41.31]Oh my god.
[85:42.47]I'm almost done with it.
[85:43.97]I'm almost done with it.
[85:49.77]I'm almost done with it.
[86:04.64]He's directing the third one, right?
[86:06.32]Are we certain of that?
[86:07.88]Do we know that?
[86:09.89]Do we know that for sure?
[86:10.85]Are we certain?
[86:13.05]God, I hope so.
[86:34.60]What is he doing?
[86:35.52]This guy's freaking me the fuck out.
[86:37.48]Hey!
[86:55.20]I'm gonna go up there to try to fight him.
[86:56.38]He's gonna come revive this motherfucker and I'm gonna scream.
[86:59.94]Here he comes.
[87:01.06]That's my chance.
[87:04.45]I don't even... Get out of here.
[87:06.07]Get out of here.
[87:09.33]Go ahead.
[87:10.03]Fly away.
[87:13.86]I do need that fucking health, though.
[87:20.94]I need the health that's up there.
[87:23.76]Where is he?
[87:27.96]Where is he?
[87:35.24]Get out of here!
[87:38.40]I'm just scaring him away.
[87:39.49]Ugh, okay.
[87:40.23]I have to make a move.
[87:47.26]He wants me to make a move so bad so he can come down and do this.
[87:49.48]I gotta make a move.
[88:04.70]Get the fuck out of here.
[88:11.01]This is stupid.
[88:12.63]This is stupid, okay?
[88:13.85]This is stupid.
[88:14.89]This is stupid.
[88:17.17]Please.
[88:40.04]Don't do this.
[88:43.57]Don't even think about it.
[88:45.69]Get out of here.
[89:00.11]Mercy.
[89:01.83]Go off.
[89:07.58]This is going to take forever.
[89:10.82]I have to get in there and fight him.
[89:13.30]I can't just do this.
[89:14.38]This is dumb.
[89:19.04]I have to fight him.
[89:20.60]I have to fight him.
[89:40.47]Holy shit, you let me heal.
[89:41.55]What a fucking asshole.
[89:45.17]Go get him.
[89:46.03]Okay, I'm ready.

[91:03.35]Get away.
[91:03.65]Get out.
[91:11.93]Alright, now we play safe.
[91:14.23]I'm not fucking around.
[91:16.58]He's gonna hit his head right on the pole.
[91:34.51]Okay, we're good.
[91:35.65]I'm gonna follow him this time.
[91:42.30]He went the other way.
[91:55.98]Uh-oh.
[92:01.18]He's gonna get it!
[92:04.45]He's gonna get it!
[92:07.01]Settle down.
[92:07.57]It's alright.
[92:08.46]Settle down.
[92:09.44]Which way is he going?
[92:10.58]I gotta get up this way.
[92:13.69]I don't wanna...
[92:37.87]Now we kill him.
[92:40.31]He goes this way.
[93:06.11]One last shot, huh?
[93:07.03]I win.

[104:40.20]Come on.
[104:40.98]Oh.
[104:51.91]I guess you could bring them all up here and just let them go, but I don't know if I want to do that.

[107:19.98]This is gonna be the second hardest.
[107:22.27]It's $10,000.
[107:23.17]I don't want to blow this.
[107:59.47]Oh my...
[108:38.88]If the game can't even register you pressing it like that I better have done it!
[109:09.70]Wait, I can do a no.
[109:12.32]Oh, no.
[109:13.84]Back to back?

[110:19.99]Done.
[110:20.59]The story's over.
[110:21.23]I don't have any Wendy's stories.
[110:39.93]Tell us the story.
[110:41.89]Tell us that story.
[110:42.85]That was a quick change.
[110:51.49]Come on.
[110:51.87]Don't do that to me.
[111:00.04]That means there'll be another one for this, right?
[111:07.22]I'm almost at max.
[111:08.26]Oh, yeah.
[111:08.80]There's only...
[111:13.82]There's one more level of this.
[111:15.42]Both of them.
[111:20.00]At least I spent all my money.
[111:21.36]Okay, here we go.
[111:27.09]This one's not hard.

[114:16.74]Kill all enemies within the time limit.
[114:21.22]This is not the new Saber, though.
[114:23.08]What's the new Saber?
[114:31.74]Dual welding?
[114:33.29]Wait, it's a dual welder?
[114:36.25]Okay, let's go.

[114:40.03]Bam!
[114:47.11]Everyone in this corner!
[114:52.22]Let's aggro everyone.
[114:52.98]Sooner or later I'm going to be able to do the move and I'm going to fucking cut all their heads off.
[115:09.44]Did somebody's health go to zero?
[115:26.45]I'm taking the fucking Peony back out.
[115:37.54]The range of this is too small.
[115:46.01]Let's take out a real Saber.
[115:59.70]Maybe I shouldn't have aggroed every enemy.
[116:07.71]Why do these guys have so much health?
[116:18.70]Aren't these just default enemies?
[116:20.58]Holy shit.
[116:31.98]Finally!
[116:32.96]Alright, I gotta- I need that health.
[116:36.92]Just a second.
[117:01.52]I do who has the guns people just who's just spamming who has the spam
[117:21.76]There we go.
[117:22.78]Hopefully I do this in the time limit.
[117:32.25]I have 14 seconds to kill three people.
[117:36.11]This is the last person.
[117:53.78]Where was the final person?
[118:00.86]I was trying to target something.
[118:03.43]There's nothing there.
[118:04.55]It was you.
[118:09.51]Okay, well this time I'm going to use the actual weapon I should be using.
[118:23.40]This is the good one.
[118:27.50]3, 2, 1, 0.
[118:28.98]Aye!
[118:29.28]Kill the cunt.
[118:32.57]He's done.
[118:52.63]Alright, bam.
[119:24.57]This game's too violent.
[119:28.43]Sorry.
[119:30.07]What's the range?
[119:33.87]It's the best item in the whole game.
[119:38.26]I saved up.
[119:39.50]That's what we did all stream yesterday.
[119:40.96]It was me doing minigames to make $300,000.
[119:42.00]That's what we did yesterday.
[120:00.35]we wait for a spawn or use rose nasty on the boss yeah I'll use it just for something like this you got to kill him quick okay how much was that for
[120:42.64]Rose Nasty does a lot of stagger, especially if you Dark Step.
[120:47.80]I'll give it a try.
[120:48.52]I'm going to use it.
[120:49.06]I'm going to put it on.
[120:55.17]man from the east had acquired power real power beyond brute strength or deadly weapons beyond technology or gimmicks it's the power all humans have but few learn to harness it subdues all enemies with the sheer force of its will when fighters who wield this clash the battle is epic they see it in each other and form a brotherhood
[121:25.91]It becomes a test of their souls.
[121:29.03]Yeah, it's fine.
[121:29.85]Maybe someday we'll be the spectators of such a battle.
[121:32.81]Alright.
[121:43.22]Can I... Uh...
[122:03.67]There's a motorcycle fight?
[122:10.41]I want the whole nerd outfit.
[122:21.66]We actually are on the motorcycles.
[122:23.62]No, we're not.
[122:24.38]Wait, yes we are.
[122:25.24]Accelerate.
[122:26.56]Brake.
[122:27.86]Nitro.
[122:29.26]Steer.
[122:43.05]How far was this gulch?
[122:45.09]That is so far.
[122:48.11]Holy shit.
[122:51.43]You can see the water.
[122:52.33]They weren't this high up.
[122:55.13]Let's do this.
[123:00.79]The obvious fall joke.
[123:03.73]That's gonna happen unironically a thousand times.
[123:06.65]What are we supposed to be doing?
[123:10.43]Is this a race?
[123:21.68]I can't hear him.
[123:27.37]Wait, it's Mario Party!
[123:28.97]It's a Mario Party game where you gotta be Yoshi and you gotta like bump into people until they fall off, right?
[123:32.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[123:35.24]What?!
[123:38.16]Okay, the trigger to the event is closed.
[123:49.93]I'm gonna fucking watch this.
[123:51.19]He's gonna go right off the edge.
[123:52.17]It's gonna be perfect.
[123:52.83]Let's go.
[123:54.59]Ready?
[123:57.62]Oh yeah, I was the best at Mario Party.
[124:00.50]Okay, follow me.
[124:04.78]I was trying to turn.
[124:18.87]I was trying to turn.
[124:21.07]The nitrous makes it so you can't turn very well.
[124:25.35]It's not fun.
[124:26.11]I'm not.
[124:27.11]It's not funny.
[124:27.77]You're right.
[124:28.73]That's not funny.
[124:30.17]It's not.
[124:32.19]Look at how huge of a turn that is.
[124:33.95]Did I get him?
[124:35.97]Okay, here we go.
[124:48.07]Almost.
[124:48.35]Hold on.
[125:07.66]You're making this- you're making this fight- you're making this fight so lame.
[125:12.02]What am I-
[125:22.64]Back up.
[125:30.48]Back the fucking car up, dude.
[125:32.42]Did he just...
[125:54.72]Hey, he's got a fucking wall.
[125:57.16]That's not fair.
[126:02.19]Wait.
[126:09.13]Hey, that turn!
[126:10.39]What the fuck?
[126:16.28]They made this in dreams?
[126:21.42]You don't drift with a back tire and then fly forward.
[126:29.52]I'm going right in.
[126:30.12]Give me the skull.
[126:35.01]And then get him to turn this way.
[126:40.19]Oh, come on!
[126:42.65]I just roadrunnered him and it didn't work?
[126:44.15]Okay.
[127:00.20]Can I leave?
[127:00.82]Can you... Can I... Okay, can I leave?
[127:05.66]Can I... Nope, I can't.
[127:23.62]D'oh!
[127:27.90]Okay, um...
[128:00.45]Oh, okay.
[128:17.00]Wait, how did you... You not get in trouble from that?
[128:35.33]Fuck, he's invulnerable!
[128:37.23]Don't drive off!
[128:38.71]This feels like it should be at x2 speed.
[128:55.16]That's seven times.
[128:55.94]I'm...
[129:06.79]I'm using Nitro.
[129:22.18]I'm holding Z. Let's do this.
[129:26.40]Veto this game.
[129:27.38]No, I can't.
[129:28.96]No.
[129:31.18]I can hit him when he's revving.
[129:32.24]No, I can't.
[129:32.86]Watch.
[129:44.66]Hey!
[129:54.16]Turn!
[129:55.96]Turn!
[129:57.28]Turn all the way!
[129:58.64]Turn!
[129:59.58]Okay, shh.
[130:09.78]It's not even... I'm just kidding.
[130:14.06]It's not even fair.
[130:17.68]It's not even fair.
[130:19.08]I can't.
[130:22.12]Okay.
[130:22.86]How many?
[130:23.10]I don't know.
[130:23.75]Nine?
[130:24.83]I have to gift subserver?
[130:25.99]No!
[130:26.51]That doesn't work.
[130:35.97]Come on!
[130:47.02]Hey!
[130:48.63]Let's go!
[131:05.30]It's hard to control.
[131:06.42]I could give you every excuse in the book.
[131:08.26]It's fucking weird, man.
[131:10.24]I don't know what's going on.
[131:11.88]Half this game is just weird shit that they threw in for some reason.
[131:17.24]This is it.
[131:17.50]I'm going to get it right here.
[131:18.97]I just won.
[131:43.92]Oh.
[131:51.35]Actual phase is real fight.
[131:52.77]That's fine.
[131:55.07]That's a cool saber.
[132:01.22]If I die, do I have to restart at the...
[132:12.01]See?
[132:17.53]Oh, I dodged it too.
[132:21.95]That was so much greed.
[132:31.65]Not even funny.
[132:40.98]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[132:49.31]That's a long charge!
[132:56.59]I'm almost out of battery.
[132:59.40]Alright, battery time.
[133:09.49]How far does it go?
[133:14.87]Time out!
[133:18.05]We got him.
[133:24.34]I should try to Dark Step that, shouldn't I?
[133:27.86]That would be sick if I did.
[133:37.94]Oh, that would be sick.
[133:41.14]Whoa.
[133:49.22]Do I run from that?
[133:57.93]Still out.
[134:13.52]Shit!
[134:14.70]He's low.
[134:20.22]Oh fuck, here comes that, like, snake thing.
[134:22.18]Ah, he's just out of reach.
[134:38.12]Give me this weapon.
[134:38.66]Give me this thing.
[134:42.24]Thanks for letting me post.

[137:55.69]Oh, I got so careless.
[138:00.17]It's bad reading this.
[138:03.35]Oh, God.
[138:03.87]This is bad, dude.
[138:05.35]What the fuck?

[140:13.32]Unless there's no cutscene.
[140:17.06]Alright, I'll be back after you get to see this part.
[140:31.35]Start the clock.
[140:32.44]Yeah, that'll take me two minutes.
[140:34.04]You're back.
[143:35.73]I had to flush first.
[143:49.72]Is this guy still in the bed?
[144:05.93]Who's this little cutie?
[144:08.41]Is she real?
[144:09.03]Is she dangerous?
[144:09.69]How'd you do that?
[144:10.81]Read your thoughts?
[144:15.22]Well, you gave them to me.
[144:29.84]That doesn't make any sense.
[144:31.73]I was hoping you'd wander around some more.
[144:34.45]Explore.
[144:35.21]Explore.
[144:37.19]Yes, you.
[144:38.23]You did not want to go back, so you reached out to my consciousness instead.
[144:42.87]Now we are one.
[144:44.71]Let's play.
[144:45.45]Away with you.
[144:47.66]I said be gone.
[144:49.12]You should stay here forever.
[144:51.46]No way.
[144:52.68]We live together.
[144:54.10]I'll never leave.
[144:55.38]I'm going back.
[144:57.90]If you want to go to the other side, then I have no choice.
[145:01.41]I've got to kill you.
[145:02.87]Why don't you come with me?
[145:04.45]You like it there?
[145:05.65]I have a weapon?
[145:06.01]I know you're trying to trick me!
[145:07.43]Congrats, Jerma.
[145:16.09]You now have to fight Ayaya.
[145:23.53]Oh, yeah, he's got the Kylo Ren saber.
[145:26.92]attack.
[145:27.78]Dash?
[145:28.96]Hold A then release for long range.
[145:30.52]This is the Bloodborne character?
[145:38.06]That's a dash.
[145:38.78]I like it already.
[145:45.20]Ooh, beam.
[145:45.87]Oh, I missed.
[146:00.17]Whoa, I can't even... Where's the beam?
[146:08.65]Jeez!
[146:10.77]I just got... I got slapped.
[146:16.72]Oh, come on.
[146:17.64]Is there health in a dream?
[146:36.65]Get in there and slash!
[146:49.24]What happened?
[146:58.95]What, I have like a magician ball?
[147:05.37]Wait, how many...
[147:08.82]Whoa.
[147:24.49]This looks good.
[147:41.94]He's zoning.
[147:44.63]Hey!
[147:47.63]I probably just scared someone.
[147:50.07]That was like you just dropped food on the ground.
[147:55.81]And like an animal went to go get it.
[147:57.15]Like, no, no, no, hey, hey!
[148:02.04]Somebody, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[148:19.41]No, I'm not.
[148:22.99]Am I chewing?
[148:26.13]I'm not chewing anything.
[148:32.58]I'm getting way too gritty with this bullshit.
[148:35.52]Let's go back to the tried and true, uh, arcade missile.
[148:50.07]Okay, now we have to fight.
[148:51.89]No we don't.
[148:57.45]Alright, going for the kill.
[149:18.36]Don't chew tobacco.
[149:24.43]That was not a... That was like a knight.
[149:29.37]That was a knight?
[149:41.78]That was very clearly a... Like, I'm a knight and I have a big suit of armor on.
[149:49.98]A tournament?
[149:50.52]That was not what you think it is.
[149:52.05]Watching the video.
[149:58.55]What the fuck?
[150:18.62]I'm watching... Close my door, I'm watching anime.
[150:52.52]What if that's when your mom walks in?
[150:54.64]Forgive your big brother who was too much of a shitebag to thank you face to face.
[150:59.18]You're the big brother?
[151:00.10]How do you know I didn't pop out first?
[151:04.07]The point is, there's no honor in getting rescued by my younger, baby brother.
[151:09.21]So I took it upon myself to proper kill Scott Gardner, Greg Cantrell, and Massimo Bellini.
[151:15.63]You've got to be kidding me.
[151:17.17]Would you fucking people stop stealing my kills?
[151:19.95]This makes us even as far as the rescue goes.
[151:22.75]You and I still have a score to box off, but that's another subject entirely.
[151:27.57]KSing.
[151:28.39]Until we have a chance to finish our fight.
[151:32.88]Damn it, Irish ass.
[151:35.10]He could at least have told me more about those assassins.
[151:37.34]And in case you were wondering, I took pictures of the three scangers as souvenirs.
[151:41.28]How long is this message?
[151:43.68]I feel like I could do it.
[151:45.18]When I do an accent like this, you guys scream at me.
[151:48.89]Pics came out nice, though.
[151:50.35]I could probably make good wallpaper for you.
[151:52.97]I'm fine.
[151:53.85]Well, I've got a lot of things to say.
[151:58.73]I'll hang up now.
[152:00.01]Long message, isn't it?
[152:02.05]Good boy.
[152:06.46]Hello?
[152:07.06]Travis, it's me.
[152:08.58]I have arranged the next flight.
[152:09.52]You're Irish, though.
[152:10.78]Come to my office.
[152:12.46]Gotcha.
[152:14.14]Why would I speak with an Irish accent?
[152:17.55]If my, like, ancestors are from Ireland.
[152:22.01]I'm not from there.
[152:22.77]I was born, like... What?
[152:35.04]Dude, this dude's Irish.
[152:35.88]He can't even do a fucking Irish accent.
[152:38.48]How is that even possible?
[152:49.88]Freddy just gave $200.
[152:51.92]When did you do this?
[152:54.12]Like two minutes ago?
[152:54.96]Holy shit.
[152:59.66]That's $220,000.
[153:02.26]That's $200, Freddy.
[153:07.52]Freddy, you shower me with money.
[153:10.11]That's a lot.
[153:10.95]Thank you, dude.
[153:13.57]And they say it was a very clear night.
[153:15.73]Uh-huh.
[153:16.15]See?
[153:16.53]Thank you.
[153:19.07]It's just like how every time I go, ayayay, or like, ayayay, it's not like, oh, he's doing this, I hate him, burn him!
[153:27.73]Punch him!
[153:31.96]I go like, ayayay.
[153:34.22]I don't have any money.
[153:42.58]But, Freddy, thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.
[153:50.49]Cat.
[153:50.79]Cat.
[153:50.97]I don't have any money for the cat either.
[153:52.03]I need to do side job.
[153:54.43]Which one is it going to be?
[153:59.25]Which one do I want to do?
[154:04.97]Coconut grabber.
[154:15.68]Don't play the mini games?
[154:18.46]I'm not playing the minigames for fun.
[154:20.14]I'm playing the minigames because I want to make money.
[154:23.08]I'm not just like going to the arcade.
[154:26.98]It's not even about having fun right now.
[154:33.77]It's about how much money can I make?
[154:37.91]And look!
[154:38.99]The dollar signs are going up!
[154:43.74]Four.
[154:54.99]Oh, I didn't save it.
[155:01.15]Oh, you motherfucker.
[155:07.66]Fuck it, who cares.
[155:21.18]I fucking finger slipped.
[155:22.94]It still worked.
[155:37.35]Just catch it.
[155:38.07]Then this one's gonna explode this way.
[155:51.56]I like this one, though.
[155:52.24]This one's fun.
[155:54.32]Really?
[156:14.62]How?
[156:15.30]How?
[156:47.54]Alright, I got 20,000.
[156:48.60]I want to see the speedrun for this shit.
[156:55.29]It's probably so ridiculous.
[156:56.73]That didn't go in.
[157:05.61]Come on!
[157:09.59]Get in the basket!
[157:10.99]I got it, okay.
[157:15.97]The scorpion was freaking me out.
[157:20.17]Faster.
[157:49.36]Dammit!
[157:50.08]I can't do it!
[157:51.65]I tried to get it.
[157:57.43]Is Redeemed a JermaWink?
[157:58.75]Oh shit, they're almost at 15!
[157:59.91]What do I do?
[158:04.95]One more opponent!
[158:11.64]They got it!
[158:12.54]They got it!
[158:18.22]15 out of 15?
[158:19.10]Are you kidding me?
[158:19.88]Oh, man.
[158:25.36]Okay.
[158:27.37]I didn't think you guys were going to do that.
[158:30.23]You surprise me every day.
[158:31.25]I've got to give you your reward?
[158:48.61]See that shit?
[158:49.50]And go.
[158:51.86]Oh.
[159:16.82]Out of my way!
[159:23.47]Nice!
[159:23.77]Alright, what did you guys want me to wink?
[159:26.33]Oh, my webcam's not plugged in.
[159:31.15]It's not plugged in, and if I plug it in, it might break the computer.
[159:36.41]That sounds like a lie, and I know.
[159:38.09]I know that sounds like the worst lie you've ever heard in your life.
[159:40.23]If I can assure you, I will break my computer if I plug this in.
[159:52.17]Send a picture to us.
[159:53.13]I could do that.
[159:53.89]I think I might be able to do that.
[159:55.37]I gotta get this.
[159:56.61]This is $14,000.
[159:57.19]I gotta get this right.
[159:59.17]This is the hard one.
[160:00.39]The hardest one in the game.
[160:44.16]Gotta be it.
[160:44.56]It's gotta be it.
[160:45.56]That's gotta be it.
[160:47.78]Don't ever doubt me ever again.
[161:00.15]That's the last attack power upgrade, and then we've got the final stamina upgrade.
[161:12.22]Wink.
[161:12.84]Hold on.
[161:19.13]You know, I'm going to be here for another couple hours.
[161:20.81]You know that, right?
[161:21.41]At least.
[161:23.25]I'll be here.
[161:23.73]I can do it soon.
[161:24.65]You know, I can do it on July 30th.
[161:27.81]The next wink will be on July 30th, probably.
[161:32.51]Trying to plan this stuff out.
[161:48.99]Good job.
[161:54.25]Time for the mission to begin.
[161:55.43]I did want to get the nerd pants though, didn't I?
[162:00.15]Cat.
[162:01.85]Oh yeah, I'll get the cat.
[162:11.51]What do you get for putting the cat back in shape?
[162:24.78]A healthy cat.
[162:26.82]Good jump.
[162:31.16]Let go.
[162:36.65]Come on.
[162:37.55]I need a bigger one than that.
[162:43.05]That was a big one.
[162:53.42]That's the biggest one so far.
[162:54.32]0.4 pounds.
[162:56.71]Stretch!
[162:57.19]Enormous weight loss.
[163:31.92]Lifting with your back.
[163:34.68]Looks like it.
[163:38.40]Our big chunkies.
[163:41.23]Well found!
[163:43.49]I'm going for record.
[164:00.76]12 pounds.
[164:01.26]That was close.
[164:29.03]The whistle sounds like someone's trying to stop me, like, to get my attention.
[164:36.11]Like I stepped out of bounds or something, and like... Come here.
[164:40.03]There's a soccer ref back there, being like, that's a foul, that's a foul, that's a foul, that's a foul, that's a foul, that's a foul.
[164:48.92]You know, I don't have enough cards for this.
[164:52.62]That's gotta do it.
[164:57.94]There we go, premium.
[165:04.34]Alright, 11.6 pounds.
[165:05.32]That's good, right?
[165:06.58]I don't want the cat to be too thin.
[165:20.98]Push the belly to... Wait, I have to look at the shelf to learn these?
[165:31.88]Ellie to back waist.
[165:36.76]Dude.
[165:41.03]Well, I got a lot of moves to learn.
[165:42.75]He finally noticed.
[165:54.48]The cat to negative 25.
[165:55.64]I don't think that makes any sense.
[166:08.79]We got a whole game of moves here.
[166:10.43]Damn, I really didn't do any of these.
[166:25.52]The shown weight of the cat is extra weight that you need to remove, not the weight of the actual cat.
[166:32.50]What?
[166:35.20]So you tell me this cat was supposed to be 40 pounds?
[166:40.35]45 pounds?
[166:41.01]I don't think that's true.
[166:45.19]Alright, let's save this.
[166:48.19]You have to get the cat under 10 pounds.
[166:56.88]Okay.
[167:02.02]Do the mission.
[167:14.47]8 to 10 pounds is average That should decide their lifestyle Rank 4 nerd pants I will after this mission
[167:41.34]Take a seat.
[167:42.50]There's something I want to talk to you about.
[167:44.52]Another rule change?
[167:47.32]No, it's about Henry.
[167:48.88]I want to clear the air.
[167:51.40]Why?
[167:53.10]We are divorced now, you know?
[167:54.59]There's not a snake on those things.
[167:56.07]I don't want to hear any of that shit.
[167:59.23]The last time when you and Henry fought each other...
[168:04.00]Snake was the only game that we could play on our old cell phones.
[168:07.26]It was a huge deal who had the best snake account.
[168:11.05]I did not want you to have to kill your brother or die yourself.
[168:17.09]What the hell does that mean?
[168:19.27]You told me a killer wins by killing.
[168:22.77]Now you say you want us both to live.
[168:25.15]Make up your damn mind.
[168:27.87]They're our fights.
[168:29.43]And we know how to end them a lot better than some bitch in the box stand.
[168:33.30]She is telling me not to kill.
[168:35.93]How many personalities do you have?
[168:40.45]So what?
[168:41.91]You want revenge, right?
[168:44.25]Your opponents could not care less about that.
[168:50.30]Once I'm number one, these bullshit ranking fights are over.
[168:54.46]Got it?
[168:55.64]Assassins aren't tools.
[168:57.18]As fucked up as we might be, we're humans too.
[169:08.89]Ranking battle.
[169:09.83]It's time to go.
[169:25.35]Need pants, need pants.
[169:26.63]After this mission, I don't deserve the nerd pants until I can be a nerd.
[169:31.27]I can beat this without any problems and without any huffing and puffing.
[169:36.00]You know, and what I mean by that is... I don't even understand!
[169:38.72]What is this?
[169:40.18]What the fuck is dumb?
[169:41.82]This is stupid!
[169:42.92]None of that.
[169:43.98]No huffing and puffing.
[169:46.71]I don't deserve the nerd pan.
[169:47.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[169:52.63]You.
[169:53.87]Goodbye.
[169:54.43]Anybody have any money?
[170:17.95]Everybody else coming out?
[170:19.63]Yep.
[170:20.64]Oh, I just fucking destroyed that guy.
[170:25.06]I want to do a new wrestling move.
[170:26.58]To you.
[170:27.08]Oh, he was queuing it up.
[170:48.46]That was awesome.
[170:51.65]This is the best weapon.
[170:52.65]Why would I take this off?
[170:54.57]I spent good money on this.
[170:55.87]Why would I ever remove it?
[171:16.81]Alright, guys, who's got a gun?
[171:20.55]Gun guy's got to go.
[171:23.77]Special delivery.
[171:25.87]You got a gun?
[171:27.05]You got to go.
[171:28.93]He's a cake.
[171:30.41]Ice cream.
[171:32.93]You're a joke.
[171:33.66]He's a cake.
[171:46.93]Then we get to collect all the trinkets.
[171:49.91]Only a few more.
[171:54.31]That's an instant kill.
[171:56.48]It's so good.
[172:14.33]There it is.
[172:14.89]No more enemies.
[172:15.97]Or is there?
[172:16.91]Oh.
[172:17.15]Oh.
[172:17.31]I got it.
[172:17.73]Can this be it?
[172:44.19]No more enemies.
[172:46.05]30 minutes?
[172:46.83]Oh, I don't.
[172:47.89]It's showtime!
[172:50.17]Bring it on!
[172:50.77]Bitch ass!
[173:13.27]Come on!
[173:13.97]Projectile!
[173:15.09]What are you aiming at, Kravis?
[173:18.00]They're on my way!
[173:22.00]Help!
[173:26.73]Nope, this is literally 30 minutes long.
[173:30.40]Is this?
[173:30.72]Hold on.
[173:31.08]Nice dodge.
[173:52.64]I need to get some of these presents.
[173:56.50]Gotcha.
[173:57.18]Start playing music.
[173:59.94]Yeah, where is the music?
[174:01.53]Gotcha.
[174:18.39]Not right now
[174:59.50]I got a present.
[175:00.62]Cold cheese.
[175:03.75]Cold cheese.
[175:04.47]Cold cheese.
[175:05.87]Not cold cheese.
[175:07.19]They probably heated up.
[175:07.97]They probably... I never had one.
[175:10.05]They discontinued that shit before I got to be 10 years old.
[175:16.74]I would have loved to have tried it.
[175:20.00]Special delivery.
[175:29.57]Alright, is this ac- hold on a second.
[175:33.42]I can leave?
[175:33.96]I can't.
[175:40.83]You weren't kidding.
[175:42.61]Kill quickly!
[176:01.56]frozen cheese.
[176:02.38]There's no frozen cheese on a McDLT.
[176:04.62]It was just... Perfect time to just... Stop.
[176:09.82]Get in.
[176:10.22]Get in.
[176:35.74]These cars are still having people come out.
[176:37.98]This fucking clown car scenario here.
[176:42.40]There's definitely a tube in the middle of this car.
[176:44.60]And it goes underground.
[176:46.84]And there's like 500 people down underground somewhere.
[176:51.31]It's not all in this car.
[176:55.61]It's still going.
[177:04.38]Get off me!
[177:06.44]Get out of my way!
[177:08.93]Change my weapon?
[177:11.83]Why?
[177:12.49]I'm clearing... Get out of my way!
[177:14.85]Piece of cake!
[177:36.00]Okay, here we go.
[177:40.98]How many more cars are there?
[177:45.75]Jerma, don't reset the level.
[177:55.48]Don't reset, don't reset, don't reset.
[177:57.30]This is a jade.
[178:07.24]Levels glitched.
[178:08.34]Don't stop.
[178:08.82]Don't listen to them.
[178:11.98]But wait, I don't know what to believe.
[178:24.27]Don't listen.
[178:27.21]It's not bugged.
[178:28.81]It really does take this long.
[178:30.07]Bitch ass!
[178:34.82]Alright, I wanna try another.
[178:35.54]I'm gonna go back to one of my other weapons.
[178:36.82]I know you guys should.
[178:41.19]What should I do?
[178:41.79]I'm gonna give these.
[178:42.79]I wanna actually try the dual welding.
[178:46.33]Let's look at how many cases are here.
[178:56.01]This does feel like it shouldn't be happening. ...
[179:05.36]Reset startup, it's common.
[179:06.62]Don't!
[179:06.96]No, a mod said that this takes this long.
[179:10.78]No, it's common.
[179:15.67]Alright, so just...
[179:36.08]Just get killed.
[179:37.02]What the fuck?
[179:43.01]What the fuck?
[179:46.95]No, no, no, no.
[179:48.17]What do you mean no?
[179:52.27]I gotta look this up.
[179:53.53]I don't know who to believe.
[179:55.13]Everyone just freaked out when I started getting hit.
[179:59.89]Are you actually fucking with me?
[180:01.81]He's a king.
[180:07.96]I don't know Okay, there's like a thousand pizzas on the ground I'm gonna have to go get some
[180:36.14]Guys restart
[181:01.93]If I restart and it was a lie, I'm gonna be so sad.
[181:05.23]Use the guide.
[181:06.97]Alright, I'm gonna open up a guide.
[181:12.63]Don't reset, I'm lying.
[181:33.10]I just got hit by the fucking car.
[181:39.34]Okay, I think it's fucked up.
[181:44.34]Now I think it is.
[181:46.16]Now I know.
[181:47.20]I think it's messed up now.
[181:48.54]I think it's screwed up.
[181:56.75]I think it's messed up.
[181:57.81]It's been too long.
[181:59.01]There's no way this would be this long.
[182:00.71]It's done wrong.
[182:02.75]It's a bug and it shouldn't be this long.
[182:04.89]I'm starting to misunderstand.
[182:07.33]You're gonna have to do this again.
[182:26.80]No, there's no way.
[182:29.01]There's no way it's this.
[182:30.63]Yeah, I know.
[182:31.57]I agree.
[182:37.71]No, not yes way.
[182:38.85]There's no way.
[182:40.01]This is not the way it's supposed to be.
[182:43.21]It's bugged.
[182:45.21]I believe it now.
[182:52.10]No, it's not!
[182:52.92]This just got spawned over here.
[182:56.70]Oh my god, I was gonna turn it off.
[183:01.38]I was gonna reset it.
[183:23.77]Wow.
[183:26.23]Like, that's shocking to me that that's not... That's shocking to me that this is real.
[183:35.75]I was about to reset the game.
[183:38.19]I was gonna let him just beat the shit out of me and start it over and do it all over again.
[183:40.95]You guys, so many of you were so correct.
[183:44.85]And so many of you were just gaslighters.
[183:53.49]I can't believe it.
[183:55.05]I don't want to do that again, so I want to save it somewhere.
[184:05.60]Okay, I have a question.
[184:09.06]Was this made to make you go, whoa, that was too long?
[184:15.08]What was that?
[184:15.54]Is that supposed to be like that?
[184:17.38]She was called the Goddess of Death.
[184:22.98]Making fun of consumerism.
[184:27.92]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[184:29.50]Like the overconsumption of... Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[184:32.61]I get it.
[184:33.09]Other people don't.
[184:33.65]We do.
[184:33.85]I passed out for an entire week.
[184:35.49]If I'd heard it up close...
[184:52.82]I can scarcely imagine.
[184:56.28]Forget it.
[184:57.90]Let's talk about happier things.
[185:08.07]Reset.
[185:08.47]It's not too late.
[185:09.41]It's still glitched.
[185:14.49]My favorite comment I think of the whole night.
[185:20.93]Dude, you're right.
[185:21.55]I should probably get out of this.
[185:23.55]Or it's too late.
[185:27.18]That combo.
[185:33.92]Oh, the combos just keep going.

[202:17.70]Three to go.
[202:42.55]Alright.
[202:44.29]Three more people.
[202:47.71]That fight was bittersweet.
[202:52.39]Was it?
[203:08.13]Play Devil's Third?
[203:09.18]I did.
[203:09.66]I did for about 30 minutes and I took it out.
[203:14.12]Yeah.
[203:14.32]Yeah, that was part of one of the Wii fuckface nights.
[203:33.62]I played, what, 20, 30 Wii games over the course of like two or three streams.
[203:42.86]Yes, I'll take care of the cat.
[203:47.91]Let's start with some jumping.
[203:52.39]That's 151.
[204:04.18]One more.
[204:05.88]774.
[204:05.96]That's a new record.
[204:08.87]That's gotta do it.
[204:24.26]10.95... Jean's looking good!
[204:29.72]Watching Jean's slick moves has inspired a new technique.
[204:32.68]You learn the step-and-slice attack.
[204:36.16]Shake the nunchuck to perform the step-and-slice attack.
[204:41.05]Wait, is this how you unlock Dark Step?
[204:52.99]Ten pounds.
[204:53.61]And then Premium Capture.
[205:20.37]Stop, you're gonna make her underweight.
[205:22.12]10.2 pounds.
[205:22.76]Okay, no, that would do it.
[206:00.20]Can I do it?
[206:02.04]That's got to do it.
[206:07.08]That was close.
[206:09.08]Play, get you happy, and then we feed you premium hand food.
[206:36.98]Starving to death.
[206:39.14]No, that's gotta do it.
[206:40.80]Nine?
[206:41.10]Is that too much?
[206:41.78]No, that's okay.
[206:42.90]Now we feed tons of food.
[206:45.78]There we go.
[206:51.49]All done.
[206:57.13]Oh, she's happy.
[207:01.84]Any more weekly backdrops?
[207:05.40]Nope.
[207:07.91]Save it and let's see if I can do any upgrades.
[207:10.26]I wanted to hit yes.
[207:16.78]And I moved left.
[207:20.38]But you have to wait until it's fully done loading.
[207:25.26]It's whatever it wants to be done loading.
[207:26.82]Save it.
[207:34.17]What was the last boss's name?
[207:36.35]Uh... Margaret.
[207:42.10]I believe that's the answer.
[207:48.42]Go get the nerd pants.
[207:51.93]There's probably something new to unlock that you guys are going to want me to do.
[208:01.32]He's so bully-able right now.
[208:03.92]Ooh, me?
[208:08.73]What are we doing with the gym?
[208:16.13]I feel like there's gonna be one more, right?
[208:18.20]Getting maximum?
[208:18.92]Or are we at maximum?
[208:24.33]Come back.
[208:24.81]Yeah.
[208:25.71]There is... Yeah, that's it.
[208:28.53]I am at maximum attack power and maximum stamina.
[208:34.87]Music.
[208:35.37]Oh.
[208:42.64]What about Naomi?
[208:46.32]Oh, no.
[208:52.49]Yo.
[208:59.36]There you go.
[209:01.98]How's that?
[209:03.56]A little better?
[209:04.04]There ain't nothing here.
[209:10.73]No upgrades at all?
[209:19.46]Only two purchasable blades?
[209:23.84]One's just $300,000?
[209:29.18]No weapon parts or battery parts or... Come on.
[209:38.16]Alright, let's take a look at the closed store.
[209:41.75]Alright.
[209:56.17]How much are nerd pants?
[210:00.64]I got 59,000.
[210:01.10]Wait, there's dude pants, though.
[210:06.08]Hold on.
[210:06.48]Hmm...
[210:30.31]No, I don't want... I don't think I can... No, I don't want the dude outfit.
[210:46.64]Belps?
[210:59.04]I got Crocs on.
[211:00.08]That's what I thought it was.
[211:02.40]Look at my Crocs.
[211:14.71]Alright, I'm ready.
[211:26.57]Who is number three?
[211:28.57]Oy.
[211:31.88]Again with this?
[211:34.24]How do I do nitro?
[211:52.03]Why can't I go this way?
[211:57.91]There's a jump right there.
[211:58.95]Look.
[212:02.12]There's a jump right there.
[212:03.30]Are you telling me I can't do that?
[212:05.18]That's sad.
[212:10.12]That's how I got into the level.
[212:20.39]Yeah, but I...
[212:28.80]That was bad.
[212:32.08]Alright, here we go.
[212:35.70]I'm trying to get on the other side.
[212:37.10]Dude, this is just like that Battletoads level.
[212:44.43]Whoa!
[212:51.53]That was big.
[212:59.16]Yes!
[213:00.64]Dude, huge air.
[213:05.04]Yes!
[213:07.86]No, you can't do it.
[213:09.36]Don't even tell me I can.
[213:10.48]Look, you can't.
[213:12.06]See?
[213:12.54]It protects you.
[213:15.37]It puts bumpers on my bowling alley game.
[213:21.05]Yes!
[213:28.83]yes I'm supposed to be doing that yes uh it was pointless Santa destroy is a magnet for the bizarre
[213:52.33]There are things I still don't understand.
[213:55.41]It is a melting pot.
[213:57.61]Not only of cultures and people, but even space and time.
[214:02.44]You can't lose.
[214:04.92]You can't die.
[214:05.60]Nothing happens.
[214:06.68]You just drive on your bike.
[214:09.04]You could have cut scene to me for 10 seconds, man.
[214:19.72]Alright, here we are.
[214:21.32]It's not over.
[214:22.72]It ain't over.
[214:23.98]I gotta say, that was kind of strange.
[214:39.31]I thought that was a big deer.
[214:41.89]Like a moose or an elk.
[214:46.41]You have to admit, that was very elk-like.
[215:05.02]Oh, that was scripted.
[215:06.18]Okay.
[215:08.56]I jumped over it and I still hit it.
[215:18.43]I thought that was the boss.
[215:19.63]I was like, oh, this guy looks ridiculous.
[215:22.58]He's like a bubble gum guy with funny shoes on.
[215:29.86]That's a pretty sick engage on his chest.
[216:03.51]He has like a big orbital beam.
[216:05.61]Alright.
[216:06.97]Right to the point on this one, huh?
[216:08.53]I don't think I want this.
[216:10.69]Let's try the dual welding.
[216:34.21]Summons rocks?
[216:38.92]You gotta go around him.
[216:42.74]Whoa.
[216:50.66]Get up!
[216:51.18]Alright, so he's like loading.
[217:06.04]You know when the grass starts getting in the way?
[217:09.11]There's a problem.
[217:10.93]When the wheat on the ground starts getting in the way.
[217:13.11]Then you have a small issue.
[217:30.61]Please respond?
[217:34.27]Why does he keep saying, please respond?
[217:46.40]Oh, it's because he's... I see.
[217:51.62]I think I'm taking out the big guy.
[217:55.12]Yeah, I'm taking out the big guy.
[218:02.37]More damage, let's go.
[218:06.61]I'll take one good hit.
[218:15.64]Oh shit, I don't know where that's going.

[230:31.02]Look for the Hero Space.
[230:33.96]Sorry, that's all the information I have.
[230:36.00]Maybe you head out and get there.
[230:46.74]I feel like the national anthem of Santa Destroy.
[230:51.44]It's everywhere.
[230:52.10]It's on TV.
[230:52.82]It's on the radio.
[230:53.72]It's on phone calls and shit.
[230:55.76]It's everywhere.
[230:57.40]Cat?
[231:00.24]Oh, Cat's done.
[231:00.86]I did everything I could do with Cat.
[231:07.02]All I can see now is I can see if there's any more weapons.
[231:16.36]You've heard about two of the supernatural gateways in Santa Destroy.
[231:21.56]The third led to the most fitting mystery of all for a city fixated on the ranks.
[231:27.82]Sealed from the cacophony of modern life, there lived the last ascetic.
[231:34.55]Abstaining from all worldly indulgences, the ascetic spent every waking hour in training.
[231:41.71]Battle had become an obsession for this warrior.
[231:44.79]The end all, the raison d'être.
[231:48.85]You know I've never abstained from anything.
[231:52.36]Still, I can relate.
[231:55.12]When you're so focused on any goal, it can make you blind to what you truly desire.
[232:12.84]Somebody said, chat is cringe, and then somebody said, the game is cringe.
[232:20.01]Alright, anything else I can do?
[232:21.17]All we need is somebody saying that I'm cringe in the middle of that, and you've got the perfect, total spectrum of what people think of a stream.
[232:41.69]No more moves.
[232:42.75]Okay, that's it.
[232:57.51]So what's the point of having money now?
[232:59.11]There's no weapons.
[233:02.41]There's no buy clothes.
[233:04.67]There's all these interesting side jobs.
[233:06.17]I guess... What's the point of doing them?
[233:11.10]Close and Naomi Naomi hasn't had anything new for like seven or six or seven in-game hours Nothing here
[233:40.66]I kind of miss being able to come back and buy upgrades and new stuff.
[233:44.39]If I have a store, there's going to be two items to buy.
[233:49.93]Do a revenge mission?
[234:15.33]Revenge.
[234:15.81]Kill the target within the time limit.

[261:22.47]Yeah, perfect.
[261:33.00]Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where? Where?
[261:43.00]She hit face as wraith?
[261:45.00]It does. It cleans your teeth. I'm using it, often.
[261:51.44]Some would say once or twice at least, once or twice a day.
[261:53.62]That was long, huh?
[261:55.06]Yeah, ResidentSleeper.
[261:56.28]Bring it on!
[262:24.19]Is there a toothpaste shield?
[262:26.39]How do you clean your teeth?
[262:29.23]What do you guys use?
[262:32.55]I would say that would probably be a very, very bad idea if it were me.
[262:38.74]I wouldn't do that.
[262:55.95]Anybody else?
[262:57.13]Yeah.
[263:05.47]I use water toothpaste.
[263:10.31]It makes my stomach hurt.
[263:11.95]I use water toothpaste?
[263:14.21]Like water-based toothpaste?
[263:15.69]Or you use water?
[263:16.50]Are they all toothpaste?
[263:21.52]Water-based toothpaste?
[263:22.60]Like if...
[263:34.84]every time I say that we're based based based on what why do you guys do that
[264:05.05]Do you swallow too much toothpaste?
[264:08.25]Well, the goal is not to swallow any toothpaste.
[264:11.99]How much toothpaste are you using?
[264:15.62]Imagine using half a tooth of toothpaste every time you brush your teeth.
[264:35.49]How much toothpaste is one serving?
[264:38.91]It's one pea-sized amount, right?
[264:41.01]Do you like a little dollop?
[264:46.87]That's not me trying to be funny.
[264:48.99]That's actually supposed to be pea-sized.
[264:50.49]P-E-A.
[264:50.69]P-E-A.
[264:51.31]P-E-A.
[265:08.52]Alright, we're ready for the second rank battle now.
[265:14.30]This was a long one.
[265:26.45]You're thinking of thermal paste.
[265:27.79]What do you chase your toothpaste with?
[265:36.80]I don't.
[265:37.06]I spit it out.
[265:39.62]I hate using mouthwash.
[265:43.58]I really do.
[265:45.38]It sucks.
[265:47.32]You put it in there, and then you just want to get it out as soon as possible.
[265:52.56]You swish it around.
[265:53.09]You're like, I can take this.
[265:54.33]It's not bad.
[265:54.89]It's been 10 seconds.
[265:55.71]I'm good.
[265:56.51]And then that's when it starts to really, like, your brain just starts to scream at you that it hurts.
[266:03.05]And you just go, no, I don't care.
[266:04.17]I spit it out.
[266:16.21]It hurts good?
[266:17.03]It's not a good hurt.
[266:19.33]It's a... It's like I ate too many sour candies hurt.
[266:23.70]Like... I hate it.
[266:27.36]I hate that feeling.
[266:28.52]Yeah, that's me.
[266:29.18]The no more hero.
[266:34.81]How unfortunate.
[266:36.75]Right when I'm about to reach the top, you have to find me.
[266:41.10]I was hoping we'd fight after I became number one.
[266:45.20]Sorry to crush your dreams.
[266:47.54]I hate to do it.
[266:48.98]But I've got business with that son of a bitch.
[266:52.00]And I can't let you get to him first.
[266:55.27]It's me.
[266:56.55]The No More Heroes 2.
[266:57.33]Desperate Struggle.
[267:10.02]I've seen a lot in my journey up the ranks.
[267:12.28]An endless cycle of violence now broadcast to the spectators.
[267:16.42]Everybody else get a shitload of anxiety when popcorn pops like this in the microwave?
[267:19.78]Why do so many assassins join if we are all going to end up killing each other in the end?
[267:22.70]I feel like it's going to explode every time.
[267:24.24]Does it really matter why?
[267:26.51]To me, it does.
[267:28.41]It matters more than anything.
[267:31.11]We've all become trapped, don't you see?
[267:33.51]Addicted to the violence, to a life in the shadows.
[267:36.79]Once we join the ranks, we can never get out.
[267:39.88]Don't be stupid.
[267:41.14]If you get tired of the battles, just fucking quit.
[267:44.28]But that's why we all want to fight you.
[267:46.40]To learn your secret.
[267:48.12]Don't you get it?
[267:48.86]$300,000.
[267:48.88]At Naomi's.
[267:50.62]They only sell one product.
[267:51.54]You can't miss it.
[267:52.62]Well, I'm back now, aren't I?
[268:03.85]With your displacement, you are no more heroes.
[268:07.78]Show me your passion.
[268:09.28]Release me from this cycle.
[268:10.72]Free us all in a crimson sea.
[268:16.36]You asked for it.

[295:14.51]Outfit.
[295:21.71]Is it no pants too?
[295:26.23]Have to do it at the hotel.
[295:49.55]Alright, how about, like, Bellabong?

[296:06.46]Alright, let me make some money real quick.
[296:31.33]Etrus, no.
[296:31.87]I'm gonna do the meat one.
[296:33.89]This one's the easiest one to understand.
[296:36.43]Because I like this song the best.
[297:03.35]Is it square?
[297:04.01]Yep, it is.
[297:06.69]Just listen to it.

[297:37.00]Delicious.
[297:39.97]Well done.
[297:53.80]There was a game called River City Ransom.
[297:59.79]This just reminds me of River City Ransom.
[298:01.75]You would go to this shop.
[298:02.97]It would be like a bakery or like a coffee shop.
[298:05.31]And you'd sit down and eat food for health and bonuses.
[298:10.35]You'd pick up the whole plate and eat the whole plate.
[298:12.12]Or you'd eat the cup too.
[298:13.08]If you were buying a cup of tea, they would put the cup of tea in their mouth and crunch it down and eat it.
[298:25.82]I wonder if that game still holds up.
[298:27.95]Does that game hold up?
[298:28.67]Anybody know?
[298:42.32]Jeremy, you got good at the steak minigame?

[301:30.05]Okay, now we can go get our clothes.
[301:36.98]Succeeded in making about $70,000 or $80,000.

[301:38.58]$54,000.
[301:38.60]Okay.
[301:58.00]Alright.
[301:58.52]Let's go get the hotel.

[302:37.06]Take the pants off Yeah You can't
[303:18.09]When you're at the convention and you have a big costume, and after two or three hours of walking around in the big top part that has a bunch of foam and shit, you probably get so... This is... Like, I'll walk around in the bottom half.
[303:28.82]That's fine.
[303:30.76]With my t-shirt.
[303:37.70]I don't need anything spectacular up here.
[303:42.26]Pursuit.
[303:43.82]Any suit.
[303:44.84]Anything.
[303:45.24]It could be a mascot.

[303:53.83]Cat, you idiot.
[303:54.59]Okay, bye, cat.
[303:56.62]Good.
[303:56.96]You saw the extent of what I could play with the cat.
[303:59.06]Fine, I'll make it a little bit more heartfelt.
[304:02.34]Bye, Gene.
[304:15.36]Act surplus.
[304:24.79]Watch the anime one more time.
[304:26.23]You mean just the first part?
[304:32.45]The intro part?
[304:42.63]Giant swing kick ass.
[304:45.46]Giant Swing.

[304:51.34]Huh.
[305:16.97]Okay.
[305:19.65]That's cool, I guess.
[305:25.64]Coward.
[305:30.34]Naomi has new stuff, are you sure?
[305:31.76]You guys like it that I treat that anime intro thing the same way that I treat watching ads on YouTube?
[305:46.96]I've seen the same Bizarre Jerry ad on YouTube.
[305:50.11]Just skip it in five seconds.
[305:51.19]I don't want to see it anymore.
[305:56.76]You ain't got nothing new!
[305:58.16]Stop lying to me!
[306:17.20]You know the reason why they keep telling you to go see her.
[306:21.05]Not going to address it.
[306:22.99]Not going to address it.
[306:27.91]Get the final outfit.
[306:31.75]Okay.
[306:38.30]Shirt.
[306:38.54]It's important.
[306:43.42]I kind of like that.
[306:52.44]Pull out.
[306:55.10]Space age.
[306:55.76]B. B to R-M.
[307:02.98]Hide you.
[307:10.20]At the B?
[307:11.04]Hold on.
[307:15.43]The line?
[307:15.87]I like the line, sure.
[307:17.89]What's this weird?
[307:18.65]Look at that thing.
[307:19.55]I want that.
[307:24.58]Peter?
[307:32.18]Light my fire.
[307:46.97]Joker?

[308:10.02]Okay, how about these?
[308:18.37]Hey, why are these for $60,000?
[308:40.47]I like these ones.
[308:46.22]Belt.
[308:46.44]A new belt.
[308:47.00]I'll take it.
[308:49.58]It was so expensive.
[308:58.23]How about these?
[309:02.65]How about these?
[309:04.09]Yeah, I like these.
[309:05.07]I don't have enough money for all of it.
[309:10.37]I'll take it onto those pants oh I want these I'll take it
[309:47.13]This is it.
[309:48.96]I ain't gonna go do any more money games.
[309:57.76]Okay, alright.
[309:58.34]How about this?
[309:58.78]If I can do the Tetris tile in 60 seconds, then I win.
[310:08.15]I guess.
[310:09.25]Okay.
[310:09.51]60.
[310:09.53]Give me 60.
[310:10.41]One minute.
[310:10.81]If I can do it in one minute, I win.
[310:30.28]So,
[311:16.39]Okay, double another.
[311:19.48]Another 60 seconds?
[311:22.10]Double what I get.
[311:42.82]That's too big.
[312:17.33]Let's go.
[312:48.87]Play the Hyperdimension series on July 30th.
[312:53.67]Fine.
[312:53.97]It'll be a busy day on July 30th.
[312:54.65]It'd be nice to go home too.
[313:15.16]since it's the last day are you expecting something special what are you expecting why do you listen well it doesn't matter I never really expected to know anybody even on that phone you came here almost every day paid to hear me ramble on and that gave me as much happiness as I can hope for
[313:41.82]Why does the stream have the exact same camera angles when I come back after a while of not watching?
[314:02.01]Because it's like a 20% chance there's gonna be a close-up of a girl's chest on this game Let me hear what you sound like who you are Just once
[314:29.58]...as your trust.
[314:32.12]Shut up.
[314:34.76]It matches me!
[314:35.38]Look!
[314:48.73]What do you mean, no it doesn't?
[314:50.53]My belt matches!
[314:51.29]Fucking suck.
[314:58.76]Well, we don't have to see it.
[315:00.24]And it's fine.
[315:01.84]Back in time.
[315:04.00]Keep going.
[315:16.87]More spawns.
[315:17.51]I want to make this happen.
[315:19.71]It's happening.
[315:25.07]fast Dead Rising this kind of looked like Dead Rising you're right
[315:55.22]I'm gonna try the new, uh, special move.
[315:57.92]This is my little hot puppet.
[316:03.49]Are they all?
[316:06.91]I mean, no.
[316:32.36]Are you gonna make Stackem?
[316:35.94]I mean, I could show you guys my secret Stackem threshold, but I don't know if anyone wants to see that.
[316:43.29]I'm gonna do a Stackem's livestream.
[316:58.81]Maybe I will.
[317:07.20]Maybe I will, maybe I'll do it, maybe I'll bake some of my world famous fucking steak and sandwiches.
[317:13.56]When should you do this, when are you gonna do it, on July 30th?
[317:26.13]Ahhhh!
[317:28.89]I don't know, what, July 30th?
[317:30.28]Maybe, uh, see if we got anything else going on.
[317:32.64]Yeah, plan for, like, somewhere late July.
[317:34.12]I'm not sure if there's anything else going on that day, but I'll, um, plan for, like, late July, like, July 29th, 30th, something like that.
[317:45.06]If there's something going on, you know, who knows?
[317:47.84]Like, a new game might come out of it, but I'm just kidding.
[317:59.71]Take him with the Easy Bake Up.
[318:04.47]Uh, that will probably break.
[318:06.03]And I don't want to break it.
[318:10.13]Break into the chainsaw, guys, before it runs up.
[318:14.85]Okay.
[318:28.49]This is very, very painful.
[318:33.19]Wrestling!
[318:55.40]I really hope the Easy Bake oven turns on.
[318:58.39]I really need to make sure the thing actually works.
[319:01.71]I gotta do a trial run to like, heat it up a little bit before I even... Yeah, this would be bad if it didn't work.
[319:08.13]Let's test this shit before the stream is like a week.
[319:18.90]Why do I know exactly what you mean by Toontown villains?
[319:23.59]What?
[319:55.05]Guys from the commercial.
[320:03.22]Wait, are these guys the... You know what?
[320:09.88]I'll just do the impression.
[320:12.46]And the goons are gonna take over Toontown!
[320:14.38]They talk like that, right?
[320:25.67]Something like that.
[320:30.90]Is there just one person back here?
[320:32.24]There's no voice acting in Toontown?
[320:35.12]I remember the commercial though.
[320:36.72]It was like a guy that looked like Goofy.
[320:38.64]Had a pie gun.
[320:40.10]He would like shoot pies at people's faces.
[320:43.48]The voiceover in the background talked like that.
[320:45.30]It was just like, how are we going to save the Toons?
[320:47.88]You got to get out there and make an account at Toontown.org.
[320:51.79]Ask your parents permission first.
[320:54.59]I remember watching it.
[320:57.59]My mother didn't let me play it.
[321:03.97]I forgot to see what you guys were talking about.
[321:08.37]I didn't like how violent it was.
[321:23.54]Where's the last person?
[321:34.83]Old person!
[321:39.33]Stick to sticks!
[321:40.71]Stick to sticks!
[321:43.91]What is that?
[321:45.37]Where's that coming from?
[321:53.22]What is that?
[321:59.42]Game breaking bug.
[322:00.44]Delete the stream.
[322:01.26]No, it's just this one person hiding behind a wall.
[322:20.37]What's the point?
[322:23.60]Bastards!
[322:24.60]Help!
[322:25.38]Help!
[322:28.75]Save the toon!
[322:34.10]Were there any Disney characters in that game?
[322:37.22]There was.
[322:42.79]There was like Goofy and Donald Duck and Mickey and stuff there.
[322:53.90]Okay, this is where we switch.
[322:56.90]Switch to your guy's favorite weapon.
[323:01.67]And... go!
[323:12.16]The welding would be so bad.
[323:40.33]I feel like it would be a pain in the ass to accidentally hit yourself and shit.
[323:43.86]It would be hard to... Oh, just give me a big heavy shield and then a small knife.
[323:51.02]I just want a huge steel shield that blocks everything.
[323:55.36]And then like a paring knife, like a cheese knife.
[323:58.90]And I get in close and just like... Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap in the neck.
[324:09.87]I smalled, like, a dagger.
[324:11.03]A little one.
[324:13.39]You mean a shield?
[324:14.09]That's what I'm saying.
[324:14.73]I just said shield.
[324:17.51]Shield with a small paring knife.
[324:22.89]You weren't always like, I would do a two-handed broadsword.
[324:25.60]No, you wouldn't.
[324:26.58]Those things are like fucking 700 pounds.
[324:28.32]No, you wouldn't.
[324:30.76]I'd use a double-sided katana.
[324:32.80]No, you wouldn't.
[324:33.36]You'd cut your whole, you'd cut your legs off.
[324:36.09]No, you'd use a cheese knife.
[324:37.77]With a big shield like the rest of them.
[324:40.98]You guys don't know, it took four people to lift up a broadsword.
[324:50.68]One person to hold the shaft.
[324:54.51]Two people to hold that guy up by the shoulders.
[324:57.33]And then a guy to sit on.
[324:59.57]In case you fall down.
[325:14.17]Come here.
[325:16.39]Spawn already.
[325:17.01]He is pretty nice.
[325:27.62]He's not spawned in.
[325:28.86]Come on.
[325:37.59]For most of us that are like, man, I would love him.
[325:39.91]Just like an old knight, like King Arthur.
[325:42.65]I would want a big sword like King Arthur.
[325:45.83]You would pick that thing up, do a huge swing with it, and throw your back out and put it down and be like, nah, never mind.
[325:54.00]You get like a muscle spasm trying to hold it straight in the ear.
[326:04.78]And don't even get me started on using a whip.
[326:20.16]You will swing that whip around and try to get practice hit and that thing will come back and crack you in the face.
[326:25.06]And you're gonna lose the top half of your lip.
[326:40.37]What's the best weapon?
[326:42.29]Uh, it's very easy.
[326:44.09]Either a small cheese knife or a spear.
[326:49.04]Just a long-ass spear with a big, pointy, really light, big, pointy thing of the enemy.
[326:56.04]Walk and stick it toward him.
[326:58.14]Spear.
[327:08.44]Big spear with a shield.
[327:16.37]Or a big rock.
[327:20.53]No, yeah, I can see that.
[327:22.31]Like a big stone.
[327:23.17]Like a big rock to throw at people.
[327:25.54]Like hit them in the head with.
[327:29.76]Spear and shield, yeah.
[327:32.80]That means people can't come near you.
[327:34.20]And if they do, they're going to hit the shield.
[327:37.72]Open the door.
[327:41.01]Oh, I have to open the door.
[327:42.23]Yeah, somebody's got it.
[327:46.49]You do the thing where you all have a shield and a spear.
[328:10.24]You stand back to back to back to back to back and you walk like a crab.
[328:16.40]No one will ever touch you.
[328:21.52]Phalanx.
[328:25.44]Phalanx formation.
[328:27.18]Yeah.
[328:33.33]Shit works.
[328:41.46]Who's weak to firebombs.
[328:45.42]Um, they'll just update it and have like a powder guy.
[328:49.00]That has like a bunch of water and like powder and shit.
[328:50.76]They're like, dump on the- if there's a fire.
[328:53.73]You gotta even have a weapon.
[328:58.99]Fuck, man!
[329:03.99]Oh, just make a big umbrella.
[329:05.61]No, okay, let me improve the balance.
[329:07.73]Just have a big umbrella made out of shield material that a guy in the middle holds up.
[329:12.85]So you get six phalanxes that they're facing out with their spears of shield.
[329:16.70]Then you've got a guy with an umbrella in the middle who walks with them.
[329:19.80]He covers everybody with the steel shield umbrella.
[329:22.38]You're a joke!
[329:42.29]I mean, you might not win any battles or anything because eventually you'd have to advance and what are you gonna do?
[329:52.78]Only one, but for defensive purposes, you never could touch it.
[330:04.03]lose every battle.
[330:04.97]No, it's called only fight on your own home turf.
[330:09.83]And everybody does that.
[330:17.71]And everyone would be practicing the whole time.
[330:19.52]Even the waiters and waitresses and the cook staff at restaurants would be doing it too.
[330:24.98]Back to back to back, walking backwards.
[330:26.40]Need to learn.
[330:27.86]It's hard to do.
[330:30.12]Bring it on!
[330:37.93]Bring it on!
[330:46.09]what about tanks yeah but we're talking about not current we're talking about like medieval weapon stuff yeah yes the solution if I had a phalanx right now oh you just snipe me from a mile away
[331:13.11]Why are the shortest men the best generals?
[331:15.89]I think you're making a reference to Napoleon.
[331:19.66]Napoleon lost 70% of every fight he was in.
[331:22.16]He was really good at chess.
[331:46.52]He's historically illiterate.
[331:53.92]Wait, wasn't Napoleon like so good at what he did they like shot him out of a cannon on an island or something and he wasn't allowed to come back?
[332:22.89]And he came back and everybody was just cool with him.
[332:30.75]Why do I... Okay, hold on a minute.
[332:32.93]I'm going to be talking about potential...
[332:36.91]potential spoilers for the Marvel Universe, especially a character that's very large and very green.
[332:43.22]So if you don't ever want to hear anything to do with a very large, green person in Marvel, I want to talk about some stuff that happened in the comic book and have a little comic book session.
[332:53.06]So...
[333:12.75]I'm just giving enough time for people to not want to listen to this.
[333:17.18]It's old, but it's still, you know, what if you're, like, in the middle of it?
[333:19.50]What if you're in the middle of, like, reading Marvel comics right now?
[333:24.02]You're on the next page.
[333:27.54]You're on right now.
[333:28.22]I don't want to do that to somebody.
[333:30.76]Okay.
[333:32.21]Here we go.
[333:33.73]Um...
[333:40.38]So, we're going to talk about the Incredible Hulk.
[333:44.06]On issue whatever the fuck it is, for the series, which was called the Civil War series.
[333:49.78]Didn't they shoot Hulk out of a cannon?
[333:55.71]Like, get rid of him?
[333:57.71]He's like Napoleon.
[333:58.43]They did the Napoleon show.
[334:00.11]Shit!
[334:00.47]Shit!
[334:00.87]Shit!
[334:01.89]Shit!
[334:08.19]They did this, right?
[334:09.07]So, okay.
[334:10.89]Make sure I got that right.
[334:18.91]Fuck, that was the next page.
[334:20.55]It's him getting shot out of a cannon with his hands all the way to his sides.
[334:25.88]Flying towards the camera with like a... And big speed lines behind him.
[334:31.40]And the cannon in the distance with smoke.
[334:33.90]Sorry.
[334:35.14]I ruined it for you.
[334:43.88]Wait, save the game.
[334:45.47]There's no save.
[334:45.99]About to die.
[335:03.93]Is there a reason why I just have this every five seconds?
[335:12.21]I like it, don't get me wrong.
[335:14.94]It speeds things up a lot.
[335:28.85]What the hell are you... You talk too much on your livestream broadcast.
[335:41.32]Dude, stop talking on this live broadcast with a mic on your face.
[335:45.78]I just wanna hear... Fuck it!
[335:48.12]What the fuck?
[336:02.68]No commentary playthrough.
[336:04.34]When was the last time you watched one of those?
[336:05.70]From my understanding, everybody skips those fucking videos.
[336:13.23]Please, tell me more about the data that you have.
[336:27.96]Next panel.
[336:29.12]Urban at 8-5, firing out of cannon.
[336:33.92]Hands down by side.
[336:35.02]Screaming into the camera.
[336:40.31]All the way down, zoomed out, all the way.
[336:42.33]It's a computer with chat on it, laughing.
[336:51.69]Out of my way!
[336:54.65]Out of my way!
[337:04.81]Chat controls the cannon.
[337:06.13]New move.
[337:06.70]That was a new move but it wasn't the one.
[337:17.90]Come here.
[337:45.09]That's the easiest way to get rid of all those guys.
[337:50.75]There's a guy behind there.
[337:53.17]Chainsaw.
[337:53.53]Chainsaw.
[337:53.73]Chainsaw.
[338:02.08]That works too?
[338:14.60]we talked about this which does surgery on somebody right the thing that I didn't know if I could do it or not where like I am on camera and I'm like okay guys I'm looking forward to it you gotta do surgery on me I'm in like a hospital
[338:39.72]Like, I swallowed, like, a toy car.
[338:41.63]Which you guys have to get.
[338:43.67]Yeah, I swallowed a toy car.
[338:45.89]Don't ask me how, but I did.
[338:47.01]It just was in my food.
[338:48.09]And you guys have to get the toy car out by doing surgery.
[338:51.25]And, like, I lie down, and the camera cuts for a second.
[338:53.27]It comes back, and there's, like, a... Like, a dummy lying there.
[338:56.14]Do you guys have access to, like, a scalpel?
[339:00.50]Like, a pair of scissors and shit to, like, get in?
[339:02.62]And it's all... I didn't know if I could do this or not.
[339:07.22]Because...
[339:10.08]It would be, you could like go in there and it'd be like fucking meat and goo and shit.
[339:15.27]You'd have to find the car.
[339:17.27]And when you were done and you like sealed me up, I just, you know, the camera cut away for a second.
[339:20.61]I got out of the bed and I was like, oh man, I feel pretty good.
[339:22.72]Nice job, Jack.
[339:24.64]IRL surgeon simulator, yeah.

[340:24.33]Doctor, this is... We're supposed to be going into his stomach to find the toy car.
[340:28.01]Are you sure you want to be up there on his... on his head?
[340:31.09]You're going down to his feet.
[340:39.65]You don't need... Okay, you don't need to take off his...
[340:43.65]I feel like there's something I probably couldn't do this some you know, I feel like Hey here we are a final confrontation
[341:19.49]Back!
[341:20.63]There you are!
[341:24.46]Travis, took you long enough.
[341:27.12]Thought the suspense was gonna kill me.
[341:29.52]How will he make his entrance?
[341:31.10]Is he emo or grunge?
[341:32.86]What's his fighting style?
[341:34.42]How's his broke-ass face gonna look when he dies?
[341:37.63]So much hostility.
[341:38.95]Why?
[341:39.85]Why'd you kill him?
[341:40.63]Ironic question coming from an assassin.
[341:43.29]Did you honestly think you could take so many lives and never suffer retribution?
[341:47.31]Have you never even seen a kung fu movie spot?
[341:50.94]I used to have that outfit.
[341:52.98]I'm glad I didn't walk in here with the same outfit.
[341:55.72]Not only did you murder my father, but my two brothers as well.
[342:00.45]That is why I took your best friend's life.
[342:03.27]Makes sense, Travis.
[342:04.97]It's called poetic justice.
[342:08.07]Go to hell.
[342:09.41]Don't ever compare Bishop with your shithead family.
[342:15.04]This is the shark tank room.
[342:16.99]Oh my goodness.
[342:34.71]Now you're feeling it.
[342:35.79]That's your life losing all meaning.
[342:38.42]You've got nothing left except this fight.
[342:40.92]Now I know you'll put all you have into this.
[342:43.34]Yeah, those are cakes.
[342:44.66]Very highly detailed cakes.
[342:47.10]Yes.
[342:48.34]A fight to the death.
[342:50.46]Get angry.
[342:51.88]So angry you start convulsing.
[342:54.84]Now, draw your katana.
[342:57.60]I'll relish every moment, every second of this kill.
[343:01.89]May you savor your death as well.
[343:04.41]Enough!
[343:08.45]Let the final battle begin!
[343:10.67]This is the beginning of the end!
[343:19.07]I can't hit him.
[343:20.65]Alright.
[343:21.25]There he goes.
[343:23.27]He did that.
[343:24.10]Can I suplex him out of the car?
[343:51.29]So you gotta have that beam hit him.
[344:04.89]It really is the broomer.
[344:06.95]Alright, hit him.
[344:15.10]I'll wait for it.
[344:16.58]What happened?
[344:24.64]Alright, fire that laser at him.
[344:30.70]Fire the laser at him!
[344:36.67]Fire!
[344:36.97]Fire!
[344:55.96]Yeah, what the fuck?
[344:59.22]Alright, here we go.
[345:01.13]Holy shit, okay.
[345:30.77]Is that 100 subs from Freddy?
[345:34.93]Holy shit.
[345:39.65]Freddy gave 100 subs.
[345:45.39]That's bullshit.
[345:46.37]I'm sitting here spamming.
[345:47.91]What?
[345:48.19]Wait, it's supposed to happen.
[345:58.70]I already gave 100 community subs.
[345:59.58]Yeah, so he's not dead.
[346:00.18]That's fucking so much money.
[346:03.26]Thanks so much, Freddy.
[346:04.00]Thanks, bro.
[346:29.61]Oh, I wasn't in the right spot.
[346:32.81]Is there a... Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[346:40.33]Out of battery.
[346:44.64]Is there any healing anywhere over here?
[346:51.04]I didn't see any of them.
[346:52.58]Is there a box?
[346:54.68]Yes, there is.
[347:02.87]What is he doing over there?
[347:05.55]Go.
[347:29.73]I've been waiting for this Let's see the game Bring it on
[348:01.15]No, no, not yet!
[348:10.19]The show has just begun!
[348:12.86]Oh, of course he has to do the injection thing.
[348:24.73]You gotta be shitting me!
[348:29.86]This is a fight to the death.
[348:31.99]Sure it is.
[348:33.01]Okay.
[348:36.13]I've walked.
[348:42.92]That hurt.
[348:47.82]With my friend.
[348:48.42]There we go.
[349:01.27]Dodge!
[349:01.88]Move!
[349:04.06]I'm gonna do it!
[349:09.50]The spin, finally!
[349:11.08]Shit!
[349:30.87]Ace two.
[349:31.29]Oh, fuck.
[349:33.15]I almost hit a battery.
[349:38.63]Oh, shit.
[349:39.73]Oh, shit.
[350:00.01]Watch out for that crab!
[350:02.71]No!
[350:03.31]I tried to get away from it.
[350:06.25]It's a huge... Oh, that's not even that much health.
[350:07.49]I'm fine.
[350:07.87]Freaked out for no reason.
[350:25.60]That's what I'm talking about.
[350:27.28]Back in the action.
[350:34.35]Oh shit Oh fuck you
[351:08.45]Don't get in the window.
[351:11.81]Wait, can I throw him out the window?
[351:29.59]Get me up!
[351:33.45]Cheater.
[351:34.59]Battery.
[352:01.14]What the fuck just happened?
[352:04.86]No!
[352:06.14]Alright, get him out.
[352:15.82]Throw him out of the window.
[352:44.99]Do I get health?
[352:51.09]Back to the window.
[352:51.71]I mean, no, back facing the... I need that health right now.
[353:05.90]Give it to me.
[353:09.52]Give me that fucking pizza, please.
[353:26.78]HOLY SHIT, THANK GOD I WAS IN FAITH OF THE WINDOW!
[353:45.11]Is he bigger?
[354:01.79]No!
[354:04.15]What the fuck?
[354:09.11]Dude, I can't even tell if I'm dodging.
[354:32.67]Why does the camera keep going back into this fucking corner?
[354:38.68]Where the fuck am I?
[354:48.28]Oh my god.
[354:57.56]Let's do this.
[355:04.35]This is a fight to the death!
[355:12.92]Wait, what, just TH?
[355:15.96]When he Hawkeye?
[355:37.78]Don't go out the window.
[355:40.52]Get rid of him!
[355:44.06]Out the window.
[355:48.59]Do it.
[355:51.23]He's close enough.
[355:53.61]Ah!
[356:05.61]Don't have me go out the window.
[356:06.89]That would be bad.
[356:07.79]Oh, he's right here.
[356:20.22]Get out of here.
[356:36.73]Okay, now we do it again, but we're not even close.
[356:43.44]I almost have the tiger.
[356:49.72]I have the tiger in two seconds.
[356:54.66]I have the tiger.
[356:55.92]Turn it on quick.
[356:59.48]I was spamming it.
[357:06.65]Where's it brought it?!
[357:26.84]I win.
[357:29.12]Through the window?
[357:43.74]Is he even bigger?
[357:47.58]Elmer Fudd.
[357:48.78]I think there was an episode where Elmer Fudd did the superhero thing.
[358:05.31]Wait a second.
[358:06.71]You're already here.
[358:08.39]You might as well keep fighting.
[358:10.09]It's not happening, brother.
[358:11.17]The Lego building.
[358:12.59]I mean, I've got standards for fuck's sake.
[358:16.20]Suit yourself.
[358:17.94]Now, I'm gonna get my revenge once and for all.
[358:22.64]Come on, Prez.
[358:23.86]Unleash your hate, your anger, everything.
[358:27.16]I'll take it all and fucking kill you with it.
[358:31.11]Oh my god.
[358:34.83]I don't... How do I hit him?
[358:38.05]You gotta hit him right in the stomach.
[358:56.80]I feel like this is one of those, let's get a really great angle in our indie fighting film because we don't know how to hit each other.
[359:04.97]So let's just have crazy fucked up angles.
[359:08.81]We have no training at all.
[359:28.51]Is he dead?
[359:32.83]It's my computer.
[359:37.61]Oh, hit him in the nose.
[359:43.77]Oh, he's hitting right in his big nose.
[359:48.85]Is this supposed to be happening?
[359:50.21]Is this how you beat this guy?
[360:06.77]Holy shit, okay.
[360:08.13]It's lice.
[360:35.88]Jasper Batt Jr.
[360:37.55]is dead.
[361:03.10]Yeah, he still hit the ground.
[361:08.06]Nice catch.
[361:18.74]No more heroes, too.
[361:20.06]In the bag.
[361:21.28]Is there a secret boss in this one?
[361:30.71]There might be.
[361:48.68]I think we're off to the end of the credits.
[361:49.96]Are you going to play the third game when it comes out?
[361:56.81]Oh, absolutely.
[361:58.13]That was the reason to play these this year.
[362:00.97]It was because I knew that the third one was coming out.
[362:04.43]I'll play the Travis Strikes Again, too.
[362:05.93]Let's see how far I get in it.
[362:08.70]That's a long game, though, isn't it?
[362:10.68]It's much longer than these first two, isn't it?
[362:13.18]We'll see.
[362:14.06]I plan on playing it.
[362:19.34]Is the third game gonna be on Steam?
[362:20.86]I think it's gonna be on Switch.
[362:24.97]Exclusively.
[362:27.79]Right?
[362:35.67]Yep.
[362:38.17]Switch is gonna overheat.
[362:41.15]Nintendo actually funded it?
[362:45.07]Well, that's good to hear.
[362:51.24]But we did it.
[362:52.22]It's over.
[362:54.36]So that means, you know what that means.
[362:56.85]That means tomorrow we're going to play Resident Evil 3 Remake.
[363:00.21]I'm going to try to beat that tomorrow.
[363:03.37]Then Tiny Toons Wacky Sports Adventure on Thursday.
[363:21.14]Switch the order?
[363:22.90]Oh!
[363:28.07]No, I think that's a good order.
[363:29.91]That's a good order.
[363:43.93]I want Tiny Toons tomorrow.
[363:45.18]No, we're doing Tiny Toons on Thursday.
[363:47.60]And probably, uh...
[363:50.04]Another secret game for the Super Nintendo.
[363:55.02]No, not tomorrow.
[363:59.67]I mean Thursday.
[364:01.77]These credits are in the game, they're not pre-rendered.
[364:19.98]Please play Donkey Kong Country 2.
[364:29.99]I played Donkey Kong Country 1 pretty recently on my own time last year.
[364:33.95]And I rage quit at the... I believe it was turn the lights off, turn the lights on level.
[364:42.47]Died like seven or eight times.
[364:43.77]And I was like, nah, fuck this game.
[364:44.91]I'm done.
[364:55.72]Oh, that's deep.
[364:56.34]That's deep in the game.
[364:57.08]That's level... That's level probably, like, 18.
[365:20.77]Doom eventually, too.
[365:21.87]Yeah.
[365:24.81]Alright, come on.
[365:25.45]What's the secret cutscene?
[365:49.20]There we go.
[365:58.68]Eh.
[366:00.38]That wasn't an after-credits cutscene.
[366:05.09]Oh.
[366:05.61]Never mind.
[366:13.01]Finally.
[366:14.13]Here she is.
[366:16.01]Sylvia.

[366:30.13]That's fun.
[367:03.41]Rank 1.
[367:07.23]11 hours and 52 minutes.
[367:09.00]11 hours and 10 minutes.
[367:09.88]A lot of that was... TED Talk?
[367:13.78]Is TED Talk sound?
[367:17.74]What?
[367:18.09]Oh, it's Ubi.
[367:18.81]Okay.

[367:58.27]things about it I'm gonna make my own opinion on it I've heard it's very short I've heard it's not as good as the second one remake I've heard it's for the first time you know I'm going in with some muted uh dialed back expectations done one hit not even the same dimension as the Resident Evil 2 remake
[368:27.80]Yeah, I'll play it.
[368:29.57]We'll see tomorrow.
[368:31.47]We'll see tomorrow.

[368:47.05]See you tomorrow.
[368:54.34]What the hell is that?
[369:01.76]Why is that on... when I pressed outro on my stream deck?
[369:08.30]Why is that connected to outro?
[369:14.56]Oh.
[369:16.18]Because it was the first... okay.
[369:22.79]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[369:24.83]It was the image that was blown up.
[369:28.31]Alright.
[369:28.67]See you tomorrow.
[369:29.87]Let's go back and do the bits.

[371:32.45]I will play the remaster when it comes out.
[371:34.45]Yes, absolutely.
[371:36.63]I never played the original.
[371:39.36]A Frito Man, thanks for the $15.
[371:41.68]Everyone asks, where are the aliens?
[371:44.48]no one realizes they are all around us to travel to other stars and even galaxies we have to go beyond reaction-based propulsion and manipulate space-time itself the achievement of this feat will then allow us to travel beyond the fourth dimension we inhibit as gravity the ultimate force in the universe travels through all dimensions it is through reaching this that aliens will stop hiding and reveal extra-dimensional existence
[372:10.59]Did you just copy and paste the top part of your paper you were doing for your project?
[372:15.25]I mean, it's pretty good writing so far.
[372:23.24]Everyone asks, where are the aliens?
[372:25.56]That's a great opener for a school paper.
[372:29.66]Great.
[372:30.30]I would have done that.
[372:32.98]Open with a question.
[372:33.70]Open with a, where are the aliens?
[372:35.48]I'm your teacher.
[372:36.02]Now you got my attention.
[372:38.08]Then I say, where are they?
[372:39.04]Yeah, they're right.
[372:40.89]Educate me.
[372:41.49]School me.
[372:43.77]Nobody ever asks, how are the aliens?
[372:46.86]No, they don't.
[372:49.26]Thanks for the $15.
[372:50.04]You're going to get an A. Hey, Yoda985.
[372:54.12]Thanks for the $2.60.
[372:55.14]Hey, Mr. Jerma, sir, if you have one, who is your favorite Transformer?
[372:58.23]Bumblebee.
[373:05.97]There it is.
[373:11.79]See, the next thing you should ask is, name another Transformer.
[373:25.84]Optimus Prime is the only other one I can think of.
[373:28.68]Besides the Decepticon.
[373:32.18]But I think that's a group of evil doing robots.
[373:36.69]I don't know who the, uh, Omega Red?
[373:40.73]Is that the name of the bad one?
[373:42.03]What's the bad guy's name?
[373:47.53]Omega Lul Red.
[373:51.67]No, Omega, hold on.
[373:58.80]No, that's a X-Men character, never mind.
[374:03.42]Uh...
[374:05.02]Megatron, that's right.
[374:06.56]Okay, there you go.
[374:07.37]That's my favorite.
[374:10.75]Yeah, I- I- yeah.
[374:11.39]And when I would go to- Um, this is bad.
[374:13.53]I-
[374:33.02]In my art classes, I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[374:37.01]And every time there was a project to come in with something, this is not a joke, one time, I actually did a full project in crayons.
[374:45.81]Because I was too lazy to go buy all the art supplies needed to actually do the project.
[374:51.40]And actually do it for real and right.
[374:53.88]So I did it in crayons.
[374:56.04]And I, the best part about art, anything can be anything.
[375:02.06]Anything can be anything.
[375:04.04]So I went in there after doing a full crayon picture.
[375:08.96]And I was like, yeah, the childlike way that I used the crayons for the medium.
[375:15.05]And it was like, oh, shit.
[375:19.67]What they didn't know is that I just didn't buy the supplies yet.
[375:26.73]Um.
[375:28.80]Because people would come up with this really, really awesome shit.
[375:31.60]Wow, that's an amazing actual detailed full person's face in charcoal.
[375:37.42]Alright, Mr. Elbertson, come on up.
[375:40.64]This is my picture of a house that I did in crayons.
[375:45.11]I did it on purpose.
[375:47.77]Oh, you did!
[375:48.47]Yes.
[375:49.77]Wow.
[375:50.97]Excellent work, Mr. Elbertson.
[375:52.45]Thanks.
[375:55.05]I did it hard.
[375:56.01]It was very hard.
[375:58.72]people happy.
[376:03.35]But there were actually some.
[376:05.12]Forget about drawing.
[376:06.52]I can't draw.
[376:07.04]And I've refused to try to learn because I've tried a million times.
[376:09.94]And I don't have the patience for it.
[376:10.98]I have no patience for it.
[376:11.96]I'm never going to learn.
[376:13.06]It's okay.
[376:14.62]I like clay.
[376:16.18]I like molding.
[376:16.98]I like sculpting.
[376:18.24]I don't like to do it, but I enjoy it.
[376:22.29]I enjoy clay.
[376:24.77]Because it can be mushed around and molded.
[376:26.47]And you can make statues with it and stuff.
[376:30.09]It's cool.
[376:30.55]And yeah, the Bugleberry Pottery.
[376:32.81]Yes.
[376:36.41]Physical media crew unite.
[376:40.27]Just interesting to me.
[376:41.36]I like the way it feels.
[376:46.72]He's never going to draw manga.
[376:48.62]Probably not.
[376:55.31]Yeah.
[376:56.43]I did do it.
[376:57.91]And I learned a lot.
[376:58.59]There's a lot of things in art history that was interesting.
[377:00.51]If I remember correctly.
[377:04.49]Not enough to tell you what they were, but that I remember how interesting they were.
[377:10.53]Thanks for the $3, though.
[377:14.41]Hey, The Dinkster, thanks for the $5.
[377:16.63]Haha, Jerma smells.
[377:20.17]I don't, actually.
[377:20.91]I smell pretty good.
[377:23.03]LM, man, thanks for the $2.50.
[377:24.75]Jerma, since you like No More Heroes, have you considered playing Mad World?
[377:27.61]That disc is right behind me.
[377:31.12]That actually is, is it going to be kind of sad to say, that is one of only, I think, three or four more games for the Wii that I have to play on this stream.
[377:44.55]The supply is running dry.
[377:48.61]We've got Pikmin 2.
[377:51.74]No, that's for the GameCube, but still, I count them both because I play it in the Wii.
[377:59.40]Mad World.
[378:00.00]What else is back here?
[378:01.54]Hold on.
[378:02.02]Let me see.
[378:10.51]Mad World.
[378:12.87]Cooking Mama World Kitchen.
[378:19.55]And... Eternal Darkness.
[378:23.89]Pikmin.
[378:28.18]And that's it.
[378:30.25]That's it for the GameCube and Wii era of video games that I have.
[378:34.41]And then Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door.
[378:37.84]I don't have that one.
[378:43.60]Yeah.
[378:46.56]I will probably... That doesn't mean we're never going to play Wii ever again.
[378:49.12]But that's just what I have now.
[378:56.47]A unpronounceable offspring.
[378:58.59]Thanks for the $10.
[378:59.49]Just want to say I've been watching your streams for years through YouTube clips.
[379:02.90]I want to show my appreciation.
[379:04.00]Have you thought about checking out War of the Monsters?
[379:08.20]Cheers.
[379:08.50]Well, thanks for the $10.
[379:09.84]I think... I think we've talked about this game before.
[379:15.57]This is a fighting game, right?
[379:16.61]Yeah, we talked about this before.
[379:20.23]I just have to get it.
[379:27.33]Did they remake it or something?
[379:28.31]Why am I seeing stuff from 2015?
[379:29.35]Did they put it on PSN?
[379:33.78]They did, right?
[379:34.40]Okay, we'll put it on the list.
[379:38.68]War of the Monsters was a good PS2 game.
[379:45.67]I'll give it a try.
[379:49.55]Let's roll the credits.
[379:53.33]We will see tomorrow.
[379:54.45]Still have a few more bits to do, but
[379:57.70]Let's run the credits.
[379:58.66]Credits are probably going to be much faster than they were yesterday.
[380:04.04]Considering the hundreds of community subs that came in today.
[380:07.04]Does that font look smaller to you?
[380:15.24]The font is smaller.
[380:16.04]It's getting more.
[380:20.64]No?
[380:21.76]This font looks a little smaller.
[380:25.60]Thanks, everybody.
[380:26.22]There was insane sub drops today.
[380:30.10]Freddie Dredd gave a fucking hundred.
[380:33.08]So, thank you, Freddie.
[380:37.55]And the hundreds of dollars on top of that.
[380:41.03]Freddie, you single-handedly... Freddie, you single-handedly pay my bills.
[380:47.99]Like, just you.
[380:49.00]Holy shit, man.
[380:57.01]I really appreciate it.
[380:58.84]You give a lot of fucking money to this stream.
[381:00.64]I can never tell you how much I appreciate it and how much I gotta say thanks.
[381:03.68]I mean, like, hundreds of community subs, like, thousands of dollars.
[381:16.24]Thanks, Freddy.
[381:18.86]Really appreciate it.
[381:24.27]Let Freddy stream for a day.
[381:31.77]We love you, Fred.
[381:37.02]Where does he get the money?
[381:41.26]Well... I mean... Pretty big deal.
[381:50.18]I don't know how much you guys know this.
[381:55.32]Freddy's a big fucking deal.
[382:07.32]Go ahead.
[382:07.74]Go look him up one day.
[382:16.15]Got songs on Spotify.
[382:17.51]That's how you know.
[382:21.61]He's supplying you CBT.
[382:25.99]Why did I read that?
[382:27.46]I don't know.
[382:28.58]I was going to say CBD.
[382:30.60]Whatever.
[382:33.10]Hey, Z...
[382:37.25]Hey, Zyxy.
[382:39.43]Z-Y-X-Z-I-I.
[382:41.14]Zyxy, thanks for the thousand bits.
[382:43.10]Peony, MVP.
[382:45.28]Yes, I agree.
[382:48.84]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the five community subs.
[382:51.88]That's a five dollars.
[382:52.88]That's not a five community subs.
[382:54.16]I just saw the five and I said subs.
[382:56.54]It's not what it is.
[382:58.20]It's 500 bits.
[382:59.32]If you had to dress up as someone at like Comic Con or something for a whole day, who would you choose to be?
[383:06.70]Uh, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
[383:09.78]No one would know it was me, and I could just walk around and have a bunch of pictures taken of me and be in a big air-conditioned suit.
[383:16.04]So, that's exactly what it would be.
[383:18.24]Old A?
[383:19.54]Yeah.
[383:21.31]I get to be in the breeze of the AC unit that's in there, filling up the suit with air.
[383:24.37]Thinking face.
[383:27.39]Hey, Rain, thanks for the $2.50.
[383:29.09]Jeremy, can you please measure your foot and show that it's 10.2 inches?
[383:32.55]I'm not a freak, I just want to be proven right.
[383:34.67]Absolutely not.
[383:37.18]Uh, that's just, that's just, uh, that's a, that's just a no.
[383:41.93]That's an absolutely no.
[383:44.11]Um, hey, just like measure, just like, uh, show it.
[383:48.23]Uh, hey, like what, what, what kind of sneakers do you have?
[383:51.43]Show them.
[383:53.65]You know what somebody tells you?
[383:55.11]Show them.
[383:56.97]You know, you probably should know that it's like, uh, no.
[384:06.84]You know, hey, Jeremy, can you please measure your foot and just prove that it's 10.2 inches?
[384:10.62]I just want to know.
[384:11.82]Jeremy, can you please measure your foot and show that... Oh.
[384:14.54]You want me to show it?
[384:16.02]Okay.
[384:17.14]See, now I know.
[384:17.76]Hey!
[384:26.29]You're just mad.
[384:27.07]Ten point?
[384:27.73]What are you talking about?
[384:29.27]Rip Alex Trebek, thanks for the 500 bits.
[384:30.94]Jeremy, great stream.
[384:31.80]Just want to update you on the status of the custom Jerma985 Funko Pops you commissioned from me last stream.
[384:37.54]Factory is pumping them out at max speed.
[384:40.25]Adjust the payment advance a couple weeks earlier.
[384:43.63]Also, they use a non-polymer paint that causes birth defects.
[384:47.19]Can't wait to deliver them to you.
[384:48.57]And all tax-free.
[384:53.41]I'm not reading the rest of this.
[384:55.01]I'm not reading the message anymore.
[384:56.11]That's what I actually believe.
[384:58.64]I actually, yeah.
[385:04.10]I'm not saying that.
[385:05.64]I don't want to say that.
[385:06.68]Like, I don't want to say that.
[385:12.05]I don't want to say, I like don't want to say those words.
[385:18.64]No, I'm not going to read it.
[385:20.00]They say something about them having... They don't... Something about... Alright.
[385:24.68]They say the IRS.
[385:26.50]They say... Gosh darn it, I'm paying my taxes.
[385:30.99]Yeah, we all pay them.
[385:32.37]We all have to pay them.
[385:33.83]Welcome to life.
[385:35.59]Bugsmoke, thanks for the $2.50.
[385:38.61]Jerma, a few days ago I donated and talked about my first experiences watching your content.
[385:42.60]I wrote that I used to hate your videos before being a fan.
[385:45.40]That seemed to hit you the wrong way.
[385:46.60]Huh?
[385:48.55]Wanted to send this to clarify my wording.
[385:50.13]Before watching you, I just assumed you were a typical tuber and that I would have hated your videos.
[385:54.81]Okay.
[385:56.07]That was obviously an incorrect judgment.
[385:57.89]I've liked all the content I've seen you do, even the escape stream.
[386:01.78]Keep up the content.
[386:02.74]You mean the unlock stream?
[386:05.84]Well, that makes one of you.
[386:07.62]One of us.
[386:11.86]He's a tuber.
[386:12.38]I'm a tuber at heart.
[386:14.71]Right?
[386:15.19]I am.
[386:16.64]I'll always be a tuber.
[386:19.22]You know, that's not going to grow out of me.
[386:21.60]I'll always be a tuber.
[386:24.19]Now I'm just a Twitch tuber.
[386:29.13]Thanks to the 250.
[386:31.41]Glad you don't hate my videos.
[386:33.84]A dream boom.
[386:34.76]Thanks for the five dolls.
[386:35.70]Thanks for streaming a series I love.
[386:37.97]Did you check the extended trailer of No More Heroes 3?
[386:40.43]I have.
[386:41.43]By the way, Killer7 was also made by Suda51.
[386:43.15]And has a good remaster on Steam.
[386:45.79]Check that out whenever you have the time.
[386:47.19]I'm sure the chat will love it.
[386:48.29]Keep up the great work.
[386:50.57]It's been on the list for a while.
[386:53.61]But I feel like No More Heroes 3 will come out before I have the... Before I want to play Killer7.
[387:00.22]I feel like that's going to happen first.
[387:05.15]Halo 7's a stoner game.
[387:07.19]That's alright.
[387:09.57]Hey, it's Boo.
[387:10.49]Thanks for the $3.
[387:11.43]Seeing you play some more Suda51 games, I'd like to see you play Shadows of the Damned for the PlayStation 3.
[387:16.05]This production team had a hand in it.
[387:19.11]Sadly, the sales weren't up to par, but it was a very unique experience.
[387:22.37]And I'm sad to see not a lot of people have played.
[387:26.27]What was the game that was a Suda51 game?
[387:31.45]Where at the very beginning, there was this big frog boss.
[387:37.76]We played it.
[387:39.70]What was the Suda51 game that we played with the weird frog thing in the beginning?
[387:47.22]Never Dead.
[387:47.80]That's what it was.
[387:48.54]Okay.
[387:54.89]That was a marvelous entertainment game, right?
[388:02.39]That's not Suda51?
[388:04.79]Never Dead's not Suda51?
[388:05.49]This is not?
[388:09.79]And we're dead.
[388:13.29]Uh... Director knows... No.
[388:20.54]Hold on.
[388:24.74]This had nothing to do with Suda51?
[388:35.29]I think I just thought it was a Suda51 game and it became fact in my brain.
[388:39.65]Oh, that's interesting.
[388:42.36]Yeah, I'll check it out.
[388:46.54]See you tomorrow.
[388:50.02]Have a good night.
[388:50.80]There's still two or three more bits.
[388:52.54]Just want to say goodnight to you right now.
[388:56.88]Convo breaker thanks to 250.
[388:59.74]Dear Jeremiah, I'm sorry for causing you distress sometimes, but I cannot hold back from jumping when all the chat is yelling at you blatant lies and or misinformation at the same time.
[389:09.05]It's just too funny.
[389:10.29]Kind of like my addiction to picking food up off the floor, saying, when in doubt, radish it out, and then eating it.
[389:15.19]I can't stop myself.
[389:16.49]Please help, dear God.
[389:17.43]Also, I don't know how much people like JRPGs, but Xenoblade Chronicles is like Chrono Trigger, like a Chrono Trigger tier JRPG of the decade.
[389:28.10]I know, I know, and I don't know what's real.
[389:29.82]It's hard to determine what's even real.
[389:34.94]Never played it.
[389:35.36]Xenoblade is 1,000 hours long.
[389:40.77]You probably won't see it on this stream.
[389:42.95]There's a strong cutoff on this channel where if a game is going to take more than 40 to 50 hours on paper, that means it's going to be 1 to 200 hours on this stream.
[389:56.94]I don't think I have the brain to commit to that.
[390:07.99]But I will play Chrono Trigger because I know everything about it.
[390:10.67]Blueberry Juice, thanks for 250.
[390:13.16]No, you can't just use the Peony for the entire game.
[390:18.00]You're the one that said the caveman thing.
[390:22.70]Ah, Stacoms.
[390:23.24]And it's fun to say, too.
[390:41.64]Hey Drumager, thanks for the $2.50.
[390:42.92]What the fuck happened to Resident Evil 4 on Wii?
[390:44.60]That was the stream I was looking forward to the most.
[390:46.90]July 30th.
[390:50.58]July 30th.
[390:51.14]I already said it.
[390:55.52]What happened to it?
[390:58.27]July 30th.
[391:03.65]It's on my list for July 30th.
[391:04.77]I have a lot of things for July 30th.
[391:09.11]The FTK stream is also July 30th.
[391:15.41]July 30th.
[391:19.00]Pretty good.
[391:20.94]See you guys tomorrow for Resident Evil 3.
[391:23.62]Goodbye.
[391:24.25]Goodnight.
[391:45.10]Thank you.
