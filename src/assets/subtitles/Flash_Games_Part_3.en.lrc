[00:01.34]What's up?
[00:01.66]How you doing?
[00:02.52]There's a bird at my window.
[00:06.16]Sorry, I was like one minute late.
[00:08.40]I had to see it.
[00:09.34]I heard like a tapping, like tap at the window.
[00:12.00]I was like, that's a bird.
[00:13.74]That's definitely a bird.
[00:16.46]I was like, I gotta see him.
[00:20.64]I missed him.
[00:21.48]Didn't see the bird, unfortunately.
[00:24.83]Listen to me.
[00:25.59]You hear the voice, right?
[00:26.33]Kind of getting back to normal.
[00:28.75]It's a little grungy, but you know.
[00:32.03]That's a good excuse.
[00:35.05]So those of you that didn't know.
[00:36.63]The reason why I've been gone for the last like four or five days.
[00:40.57]Is specifically because I couldn't talk.
[00:44.35]I was sick.
[00:45.59]For about a week and a half.
[00:47.81]With some type of cold or flu or something.
[00:49.76]I tested negative for COVID.
[00:53.62]That's a good thing.
[00:55.40]But I blew out my voice.
[00:59.58]The day after that last stream.
[01:02.51]I sounded like this.
[01:03.57]I couldn't even talk because I blew my voice out somehow.
[01:11.92]How am I talking now?
[01:12.78]Because that was a week ago.
[01:21.74]Joan Rivers, yeah.
[01:25.15]No, the last time, yeah, don't we know?
[01:26.84]When I turned the stream on last, that's the last time that I was, like, alive.
[01:31.70]I just go into, like, a hibernation.
[01:33.69]I go, you just power me off, and then you turn me back on.
[01:36.11]Hold on, I gotta get auto.
[01:57.67]but now I'm feeling a lot better I haven't been sick for probably at least a few days but I've just barely last night into today I haven't had a just completely constricted horrendous voice so I didn't want to talk I'm trying to keep my mouth shut and here we are now I should be fine scrap this for an auto stream
[02:26.67]Oh, I just want to like chill and like play flash games.
[02:29.34]What do you mean scrap this shit?
[02:30.82]People have been asking for flash games for like a year.
[02:33.20]I'm not going to play Cyberpunk.
[02:39.46]I probably, I don't know.
[02:40.12]I probably will never play Cyberpunk.
[02:42.98]You want me to be honest?
[02:46.23]It's probably cool.
[02:47.27]I don't know.
[02:51.37]Maybe eventually.
[02:53.48]I mean, like, look, I'm like... I play new games a year after they come out.
[02:59.48]Or, like, at least a few months.
[03:00.52]What is this?
[03:02.98]Hold on.
[03:06.92]Cyberpunk sucks.
[03:08.70]Does it, though?
[03:09.10]I mean, I don't think it does.
[03:10.70]Who told you that?
[03:14.77]We had a bunch of subs come in.
[03:15.69]Thank you.
[03:16.41]Nukable, SuperBruce, Bananarism, and TheFoolie.
[03:20.01]All for five community subs.
[03:21.33]Back to back to back to back to back.
[03:24.52]Thanks, guys.
[03:29.42]All bugs, no snacks.
[03:31.80]But yeah, is it any good?
[03:35.14]Do a cheese and wine tasting stream.
[03:37.42]I didn't even tweet this stream out yet.
[03:38.84]Hold on.
[03:39.68]It says in the title, just chill, okay?
[03:46.68]Five subs from any neb subs here.
[03:49.06]I don't know.
[03:52.26]Are there?
[04:02.82]Irma, please, we need the funny.
[04:05.74]That's what I'm doing here, man.
[04:06.94]I'm trying to come back so I can give you the funny.
[04:09.50]I almost just like coughed, like phlegm puked on you.
[04:12.65]And that would have been horrible.
[04:13.97]Some of you heard it.
[04:15.31]Some of you were like, I heard that.
[04:16.83]That was like phlegm coming up from like your esophagus all the way into your mouth.
[04:20.60]You heard it.
[04:21.08]I know some of you did.
[04:22.32]That's why it took a little bit of time.
[04:26.01]Also, we have to talk really quickly about, of course, that an anonymous gifter has given five give me 30 subs.
[04:33.80]Besides that, in the Discord right now, guess what channel just opened?
[04:42.37]Come on, let's see some slug pogs.
[04:44.90]The New Year's Eve nomination and discussion channel is open.
[04:49.21]You're going to be able to nominate stuff.
[04:51.29]Maybe even add categories.
[04:52.75]It's just open for discussion.
[04:54.23]It's going to be up there for another probably 8-10 days.
[04:59.30]Voting will commence after that.
[05:02.42]So you got about 10 days to figure out your nominations for the year.
[05:09.71]Cyberpunk in two hours.
[05:11.03]I don't care.
[05:14.19]Look, I'm not playing Cyberpunk.
[05:23.82]That's a Reddit game.
[05:24.80]That's not a Reddit game.
[05:28.54]No, that's a mainstream huge video game.
[05:31.46]So many people are waiting for that.
[05:33.02]That's not just like Redditors that are waiting to play Cyberpunk.

[06:09.74]Although, I kind of do that anyways sometimes.
[06:11.54]I do that for fun all the time.
[06:14.13]I didn't even say a title.

[10:06.48]I seriously feel like I got hit in the head by a frying pan.
[10:09.94]I got hit right in the fucking head by a frying pan.
[10:11.94]I gotta turn this on in my mixer.
[10:15.36]I feel like that's what it would feel like.
[10:18.34]Jesus.
[10:18.76]I'm gonna end up with like... Okay.
[10:24.74]Is that better?

[11:13.84]Okay.
[11:14.30]Wait, now it's not zoomed in for me, though.
[11:15.95]This needs to be zoomed in.

[15:09.32]How do I keep dying from the same person?
[15:12.00]It's like, have I not burned in my memory that that person is here?

[15:24.48]What's this game called?
[15:27.63]Bouncy Castle?
[15:36.06]Dev here?

[16:21.85]I gotta beat this level though.
[16:22.80]I'm not pretending.
[16:26.04]By the way, speaking of pretending, that is a new category in the 2020 best of worst of the year.
[16:36.14]Your nominations for the new category of worst he is pretending moment where you thought I had to have been making it up.
[16:42.46]There's no way it would be fake.

[16:45.63]I mean, you know.
[16:57.65]I swear to God.
[17:03.79]I promise.
[17:06.53]Bouncy louncy?
[17:08.62]What?

[17:11.16]I don't know what they said.
[17:11.90]Alright, I'm done.
[17:13.76]I'm done with bouncy castle.
[17:14.88]I don't want to play it anymore.
[17:16.46]No more bouncy castle for me.
[17:19.70]This is so easy.
[17:20.68]I'm just not paying attention.
[17:22.41]Pay attention!
[17:37.24]I'm so glad I didn't decide to play Spelunky 2 today.
[17:39.73]It's just not one of those days, right?
[17:41.17]You can already tell.
[17:42.41]It's not one of those days.
[17:43.77]I beat it, see?

[18:04.11]Boink.
[18:05.05]Boink.
[18:08.24]Stop breaking them, you dickhead.
[18:12.72]I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
[18:13.80]Can you see the mouse?
[18:14.62]Oh, shit.
[18:15.36]That's what everybody was yelling at me for.
[18:16.58]I'm sorry.
[18:17.78]Everybody was screaming at me.
[18:19.62]They were like, get it off the screen.
[18:22.00]Get it off.
[18:22.40]Alright.
[18:26.48]I got to beat one more level in bouncy quest, and then we're going to move on to the next one.
[18:30.60]Whatever it is.
[18:31.04]I don't know.
[18:32.60]I'm like, no, we're done.
[18:38.47]How about Idle Racing?
[18:40.59]Simplified racing game where you don't actually race but manage cars, garages, and races.
[18:45.50]Each race has its upgrades in racing.
[18:50.84]Our choice now.
[18:51.82]Okay.
[18:52.98]Well, it has to be on a page.
[18:55.70]Let me choose.

[23:04.98]Standalone game with all unlocked features is coming to Steam on December 15th, 2020.
[23:10.90]Uh-oh.

[23:24.17]Hold on, it's too zoomed in.
[23:28.22]I'm not going to put my email in anywhere.
[23:29.64]How would I put my email in?
[23:39.89]Do it.
[23:40.25]Do it.
[23:41.69]Guys, some of you might remember.
[23:43.95]Back in the day, there would be a mall.
[23:48.89]Of course, there would be a mall.
[23:50.56]You know, back then when there were malls.
[23:52.88]At your mall...
[23:54.48]There used to be a little drop box where you would just sign up to try to win something.
[23:58.34]You would put all your information on it and drop it into a little box and hope you, like, got, like, your name on a list or something.
[24:03.15]Or you got where... This is like... This is dropping your name in that, like, mall box of signing up for shit.
[24:11.61]You're just giving an email to somebody.
[24:14.23]And what are they going to use it for?
[24:15.09]Are they going to tell you about beta testing?
[24:17.79]They might.
[24:21.82]That's a bad analogy.
[24:23.32]No, it's not.
[24:24.84]Maybe you just write their full addresses and shit and put it in that slot.
[24:28.13]Your email address is your like on- your email address is your online address.
[24:32.19]You don't want anybody to have that shit that you don't want.
[24:33.85]That's why it's called email address.
[24:37.33]It's your internet e-address.
[24:40.80]No, it's not.
[24:41.34]Yes, it is.
[24:42.80]You gotta be careful.
[24:43.42]Don't fuck around.
[24:48.76]It's your IP.
[24:49.60]No, it's not.
[24:50.00]It's your email address.
[24:54.98]Okay.
[24:55.12]Okay.

[26:07.29]Get out of your shelter and start exploring for resources to survive the post-apocalyptic era.
[26:13.07]Your group of survivors is small, but maybe you can find others.
[26:16.63]Start by exploring the area around your shelter.
[26:19.45]There have to be resources we can use around here.
[26:21.51]I'm not nexting already.

[26:29.49]Okay.
[26:29.95]Assign some citizens to focus on exploring and look for resources.

[27:13.75]Water and food are critical.
[27:14.89]Drinking water... Oh, um... Okay.
[27:20.89]I guess... You know when you, like, you self, uh... When you get, like, yourself in trouble here?
[27:29.12]Because I did- I was too lazy to type in armorgames.com.
[27:32.52]I searched armor games.
[27:34.48]Is armor games a safe website?
[27:38.26]I couldn't just write armorgames.com.
[27:41.20]No.
[27:42.04]I had to search for it and then click on it.
[27:51.77]That's lazy, but that's lazy for all the wrong reasons because it's adding extra steps.
[27:57.44]That's kind of bizarre.
[27:59.60]Okay.
[27:59.70]What should I play?
[28:03.14]What's this on the front page?
[28:04.30]Oh, wait.

[36:07.19]I must find a way to stop.
[36:08.91]No, there's no way I'm talking about like a game ending, like any spoilers or anything.
[36:14.23]I like ended the stream, and I like went, fuck, I'll play Breakout, who cares?
[36:17.31]Dude, without the ball.
[36:24.40]That was a bad save.
[36:25.66]Look, I'm just, who cares?
[36:31.07]Actually, I almost just dropped it.
[36:36.97]I don't feel well.
[36:39.07]What was he talking about?
[36:39.95]I'm going to be sick.
[36:41.98]We just kind of spoiled the end of Bugsnax.
[36:43.94]So I just desperately tried to pretend like we didn't.
[36:47.26]For the one person that doesn't think that we did.
[36:50.82]Oh no.

[37:04.11]How is this even remotely like that, by the way?
[37:06.17]Like, how is it?
[37:07.17]This doesn't make any sense.

[86:42.72]Why is there a question mark?
[86:45.12]Oh, about 20 centimeters off the ground.
[86:46.72]Never been.
[86:49.70]Why is there a question mark?
[86:51.56]It's true.
[86:59.39]It's one of... It's never been.
[87:01.27]No!
[87:03.03]God damn it.
[87:09.92]Oh, nostalgia.
[87:12.89]Hey, do you guys remember?
[87:15.05]Hey, who remembers this?
[87:17.29]Nostalgia gaming.
[87:19.81]Everyone's probably playing Cyberpunk right now.
[87:21.61]No, not me.
[87:22.29]I'm a contrarian asshole.
[87:26.25]New game that came out.
[87:26.89]It's a big AAA game.
[87:27.35]People have been waiting for years.
[87:28.37]No, not me.
[87:28.91]Contrarian.
[87:29.61]I don't do that here.
[87:44.11]No, we do things that, like, go, we, like, kind of do things that are, like, under the radar.
[87:49.65]There's tons of streams you can watch me play Cyberpunk, but not for a minute playing Boss of the Cliffs.
[87:57.61]I yell that to myself in the mirror every stream.
[88:04.96]28.
[88:05.64]Abundance.
[88:06.70]Egg mayonnaise.
[88:08.32]Don't screw it up.
[88:10.32]Triple woof.
[88:15.09]What are you guys- There's no answers that I'm looking for.
[88:16.86]How was you guys week, by the way?
[88:21.70]How was you guys, like, Thanksgiving and stuff?
[88:23.52]Wait, I streamed after Thanksgiving, didn't I?
[88:25.96]Yeah, what am I talking about?
[88:26.98]I almost fucked that up.
[88:32.17]You guys can't even answer me.
[88:38.27]Wait, which one was it again?
[88:39.48]Top right, right?
[88:40.62]Yes.

[88:49.67]Wait, which one?
[88:50.27]Is it okay?
[88:51.55]I forget.
[88:52.07]I forget this one already.
[88:52.97]I think it's okay.
[88:55.39]Do I forget this one already?
[88:56.35]Okay, I got it.
[89:01.04]Kind of looks like Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life.
[89:05.68]Alright, but Pa?
[89:11.42]Why is there a question mark?
[89:13.28]Shit.
[89:13.58]Shit.
[89:16.30]Is indeed the largest city in China.
[89:21.15]Oh my God.
[89:22.11]So it's the fourth one.
[89:24.83]Oh, about 20 centimeters off the ground.
[89:26.26]Oh my God.
[89:27.36]What is the digestive system?
[89:29.46]A serious... Oh God.
[89:30.78]Serious work is to break down food and extract energy and nutrients.
[89:33.12]Cheese.
[89:33.32]Cheese.
[89:45.23]I thought it was going to be a meme answer or something.
[89:50.20]At least I got to that point now.
[89:54.86]The best part about this is every time I start over, it's just a wave of rested sleep.
[90:00.86]It's like, isn't that the nature of the game?
[90:02.72]To like have to go through it a bunch of times.
[90:06.69]It's like, that's the whole point.
[90:14.68]I'm gettin' that hundred million off, I'm tellin' you.
[90:16.76]It's gonna happen.
[90:30.03]Cyberpunk 2024.
[90:30.77]2040- what is it?
[90:31.59]20- 2470- 2044?
[90:31.77]2077?
[90:31.85]No, that's 2024 is the one that I have.
[90:34.77]2024, right?
[90:44.92]Who cares?
[90:49.84]Why did they just name it Cyberpunk in the future?
[90:51.74]But like, it's just Cyberpunk.
[90:55.78]Why does it have to have a year on it?
[90:57.07]Because you know what's going to happen.
[91:02.65]In like 2080 in real life, people are going to be laughing at that game.
[91:06.57]They're going to be looking back and going like, yeah, look what they thought was going to happen.
[91:12.26]Don't ever put a year.
[91:17.55]Look at how much we make fun of, like, Danger Will Robinson, Danger Will Robinson.
[91:21.15]They thought that was going to happen in, like, 1992.
[91:24.73]Didn't.
[91:29.70]You get this question wrong, no way.

[92:38.47]Okay, here we go.
[92:39.61]A series of organs that break down food?
[92:41.77]A games console for whole meal biscuits.
[92:44.75]A series of... This one.
[92:46.05]Something best by... This one!
[92:47.81]Okay, it's top right.
[92:50.20]It was top right.
[92:53.08]I do remember.
[92:53.62]It was... Wait, remember the color or remember where the placement was?
[92:57.46]It was red.
[92:59.40]Shit, it was placement.
[93:05.51]There's a wave of ResidentSleepers It's so predictable at least do it okay at least do it by question 30 You can't just do it at question 1 through 10 and then stop
[93:28.90]Just do that yes like the whole time, but don't do it the whole time because that's like what the hell Don't do that the whole time Okay blue orange green green yellow you better be getting the next game ready because I'm gonna beat this soon I
[93:58.50]I have this weird memory that's coming back to me right now of it was four or five o'clock in the morning I was in college and I was incredibly tired and just over exhausted and I was playing this and my body and brain wanted so badly to go to sleep but I wouldn't I had like class the next day
[94:24.24]And I just was sitting there just with my eyes just burning.
[94:28.37]Just, I was on like question 50.
[94:30.33]Go to the beginning.
[94:31.19]Go through, go through, go through.
[94:32.28]Question 55, go to the beginning.
[94:34.94]And I think I'd closed my laptop.
[94:37.20]I was like, I have to go to fucking bed now.
[94:39.67]I can't do this anymore.
[94:46.45]You know when you're lying down in bed and you know that you should be sleeping, but you just don't?
[94:51.09]Because your mind just needs to just continue to do something?
[94:57.43]Sleeping is too boring for your brain at that moment.
[95:00.19]Even though your brain and body are like, just dude, just fucking put your like iPad down.
[95:04.28]Put your phone down.
[95:04.96]Just close your eyes.
[95:05.62]You'll be asleep in 30 seconds.
[95:06.94]It's like, no, I don't want to do that.
[95:09.92]I like want to keep playing the impossible quiz.
[95:12.28]I want to keep watching this woodcutting video.
[95:24.35]So judging by all the ResidentSleepers, it feels like a lot of you guys are doing that right now.
[95:27.97]This one.
[95:39.79]Okay, here we go.
[95:40.91]This is where it gets a little.
[95:41.64]Okay, I got to remember this.
[95:43.60]Is it placement?
[95:45.28]It's placement.
[95:46.12]So it's right there.
[95:47.66]Right here.
[95:48.00]Right kind of in the top kind of center.
[95:54.85]I thought it was color.
[95:55.57]Oh, by the way, anybody know how long are the game awards?
[96:02.83]How many hours?
[96:07.65]Just write yay and write how many hours it is.
[96:11.85]Judging by the amount of ResidentSleepers, whatever.
[96:16.67]Okay, four ResidentSleepers is four hours?
[96:18.53]Three hours?
[96:18.87]Is it three hours?
[96:24.93]Okay, four, resident sleep is four hours.
[96:26.53]Three, okay.
[96:27.05]Alright, here we go.
[96:30.55]I hope I remember it.
[96:31.25]It's right here.
[96:35.09]Right there.
[96:36.83]What?
[96:37.79]What?
[96:37.99]That doesn't make any sense.
[96:39.57]What?
[96:43.41]What are you talking about?
[96:45.36]Is it hidden somewhere?
[96:48.72]What?
[96:49.94]It was the red one.
[96:52.36]But it was up here.
[96:53.44]I clicked red last time and it was wrong.
[96:59.13]What just happened?
[97:01.29]What?
[97:10.05]What the fuck was that?
[97:16.43]What?
[97:17.49]No!
[97:18.17]What?
[97:19.95]What?
[97:22.48]What?
[97:22.74]I don't understand.
[97:26.96]It was correct for a second.
[97:28.52]Alright, turn off.
[97:36.09]Turn off emote only mode.
[97:37.15]I want some suggestions.
[97:38.71]I'm going to do the same thing I did when I was in college.
[97:40.33]I'm going to get to question 60 and just close the laptop and be like, fuck this.
[97:53.43]Blue, red, blue.
[97:57.33]Oh, okay.
[98:00.23]I get you now.
[98:01.33]I see what you're saying.
[98:02.63]Okay.
[98:03.15]This is the worst game ever.
[98:05.51]It's a classic.
[98:07.75]It's like saying that like Super Mario is the worst game ever.
[98:20.86]Stop.
[98:21.46]You made your point.
[98:24.20]Wait, what?
[98:24.46]You guys think I'm... You think I'm making a point?
[98:27.78]What do you mean?
[98:28.30]I'm trying to get through this.
[98:29.44]I have 100 million on the line.
[98:31.36]The deal's off the table.
[98:32.40]What?
[98:32.60]What are you talking about?
[98:35.04]There's no deal.
[98:37.20]The deal's off the table.
[98:40.94]How is it off the table?
[98:43.26]I cheated?
[98:44.62]When did I do... What are you talking about?
[98:47.24]When did I cheat?
[98:50.47]Off the table.
[98:51.17]No deal.
[98:51.77]You had one shot.
[98:56.26]So wait, it's been in emote only mode this whole time, and you guys have desperately been telling me that I don't have to keep doing this because I've lost the bet already?
[99:08.34]Oh.
[99:11.16]Well, now I'm kind of, now I kind of want to just do it.
[99:20.08]Keep going.
[99:21.84]I know I'm close to the end.
[99:23.61]It's like 80 questions or something, right?
[99:27.90]We have to pay him to stop.
[99:29.16]No, you don't have to pay me to stop.
[99:31.56]Don't pay me to stop.
[99:34.40]Okay, blue, red, blue, yellow.

[100:25.02]To be honest, did you manage to do the last question on your first go?
[100:32.19]Yes, I did.
[100:32.73]Is that a button?
[100:51.60]If thimple, click the moth.
[100:56.97]If thimple, click the moth.
[100:59.95]What?

[102:58.84]I feel like that's gonna... I don't know.
[103:01.44]I feel like that's gonna take a while.
[103:02.28]I feel like it's like a strategy game or something.
[103:04.75]Yes, do that.
[103:05.37]Is that like an idle game?
[103:06.69]You guys are gonna be mad at me for that one.
[103:11.63]Do Age of War.
[103:16.92]I will after this.
[103:17.42]Alright, I'm gonna see if I can get through here.
[103:29.23]Cookie clicker?
[103:30.13]I did an idle game already.
[103:34.61]Swords and sandals.
[103:36.07]I'm seeing a lot of that.
[103:36.87]Is that good?
[103:43.73]I... No.
[103:45.57]I legit refuse to play Happy Wheels.
[103:48.97]I refuse.
[103:55.16]Ever.
[103:56.22]I'm never going to play that game.
[103:57.40]Ever.
[103:57.60]For any reason.
[104:03.70]Both swords and sandals?
[104:05.00]Is it good?
[104:09.98]Any reason?
[104:10.54]I wouldn't even do it for a million dollars.
[104:23.13]Play Roblox.
[104:24.07]Hey, I'll play Roblox when their IPO comes out.
[104:27.78]We can celebrate it.

[105:44.33]Oh my god.
[105:44.97]Damn it.
[105:46.06]We'll figure it out the next game.
[105:47.02]We're just figuring.
[105:47.44]We're getting the next game figured out.
[105:48.56]We're gonna play swords and sandals.
[105:50.18]Possibly.
[105:51.54]Any other things that you guys have up your sleeve.
[105:56.72]Swords and sandals.
[106:00.75]Balloons.
[106:01.23]Tower defense is a pretty good idea.
[106:08.11]Swords and sandals is long enough.
[106:09.51]Okay.
[106:09.93]Alright.
[106:10.59]Madness interactive.
[106:11.83]That's an interesting game.
[106:12.67]But please, why don't you guys explain?
[106:14.25]Tell me about it.
[106:16.15]What is the premise of madness interactive?
[106:18.97]What do you do?
[106:20.74]Tell me.
[106:21.02]I'd like to read about it for the next five to ten minutes.
[106:25.06]Balloon 6.
[106:27.19]It sucks.
[106:27.97]Okay, well, that's why we're having this debate.
[106:30.13]That's why we're spending the time here.
[106:32.07]To make sure we get everybody's opinions on the matter.
[106:33.59]Top Tropica.
[106:39.50]Hmm, that's interesting too.
[106:40.76]I'll have to check that out.
[106:44.26]Interactive Buddy.
[106:46.80]Wait, is that the one where you just kind of throw the guy around a room?
[106:49.82]And you like punch him in the face and stuff and like throw stuff at him?
[106:57.39]This is the last attempt, I swear to God, no matter what.
[107:00.05]And I'm going to open up sword and sandals.
[107:07.00]No matter what, this is the final attempt.
[107:11.08]I'm looking at the capas.
[107:12.52]Okay.
[107:13.22]Let's make this interesting.
[107:14.26]If I do another attempt, add a billion to the debt.
[107:17.50]How's that sound?
[107:18.40]Right?
[107:18.94]I got it.
[107:19.30]Now I have to.
[107:28.40]This is the last attempt.
[107:31.77]Cruise, okay.

[107:40.25]Okay, put it on the list.
[107:41.24]Play the world's hardest game.
[107:50.60]No, let's play something fun.
[107:53.18]Not that that game's not fun, but you know.
[107:58.88]Age of War.
[107:59.52]I got that.
[108:00.12]It's on the list.
[108:04.52]Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[108:09.07]Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[108:11.31]Okay, one.
[108:13.21]Shepherd's pie.

[108:25.86]Thumbs up.
[108:27.53]Moss.
[108:28.79]Tasteless white filth.
[108:30.23]Egg.
[108:30.95]Click the largest.
[108:32.03]Okay, now the next one is the Armageddon one.
[108:36.47]It's the end of the world.
[108:38.97]Oh, shit.
[108:39.53]Here we go.
[108:39.99]Can I show this?
[108:40.73]What do I do?
[108:41.61]What do I do?
[108:42.28]What do I do?
[108:44.86]What do I do?
[108:45.26]What do I do?
[108:46.04]Okay, it's a big hairy asshole.
[108:47.20]Whatever it was.
[108:47.68]What?
[108:55.33]Oh, you have to pet the cat.
[109:09.16]Okay.
[109:11.02]Are you enjoying the quiz?
[109:12.10]I love all 69.
[109:14.62]My dog's got no nose.
[109:16.10]How does it smell?
[109:17.00]How am I supposed to know?
[109:19.60]Terrible.
[109:20.16]Like piss.
[109:24.65]Terrible.
[109:25.25]Fuck!
[109:27.44]How am I supposed to know?
[109:31.54]Using... My dog's got no nose.
[109:33.42]How does it smell?
[109:34.18]How am I supposed to know?
[109:40.69]Using its anus?
[109:42.31]Oh, Christ.
[109:46.22]Search.
[109:55.18]What am I searching for?
[110:25.60]I got it.
[110:26.98]Question mark.
[110:31.68]I don't know.
[110:32.32]I don't know.
[110:32.82]I don't know.
[110:33.08]I don't understand.
[110:33.58]What is it trying to ask me?
[110:38.60]It's just the same one.
[110:39.36]How many questions does this quiz have?
[110:41.24]100.
[110:42.88]No one knows that.
[110:44.61]You can't really class this as a quiz.
[110:46.41]200.
[110:49.21]It's not 200.
[110:50.21]It's 100.
[110:57.76]Skip it, I don't know.
[110:59.44]Skip it.
[111:00.62]Be prepared.
[111:01.34]Skip it, skip it!
[111:06.34]You are my candy girl.
[111:08.92]Sugar, dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[111:12.10]Oh, honey, honey, dun dun dun dun dun.
[111:15.96]You are my sugar.
[111:17.50]Honey, honey, dun dun dun dun.
[111:20.16]Okay.
[111:20.84]What is this?
[111:22.64]It's a tea bag.
[111:23.62]A testicle.
[111:24.66]Mr. T's oven glove.
[111:26.54]Question 77.
[111:27.15]It's a tea bag.
[111:33.83]But I don't know if it is.
[111:35.03]I don't know.
[111:35.55]It could be wrong.
[111:36.29]Yep.
[111:39.36]Deja vu.
[111:40.06]Plus one life.
[111:42.74]Give it to me.
[111:44.50]No!
[111:49.27]No!
[111:49.77]I'm so close to the end of the game!
[111:51.53]I'm so close!
[111:58.87]There's like three questions left!
[112:02.05]Ah!
[112:02.69]No!
[112:03.13]I ha- It's a billion dollars!
[112:04.93]What's it at now?
[112:06.97]No, I don't- I can't!
[112:08.01]That's a billion!
[112:08.87]That's too much to add!
[112:14.57]No, I can't.
[112:15.07]It's too much to add.
[112:15.61]What's the next one?
[112:16.13]Sword and sandals?
[112:18.23]Sword and sandals.
[112:18.81]Let's go.
[112:21.09]God damn it.
[112:21.63]I really want to beat it too.
[112:24.96]Swords and sandals.
[112:26.22]Wait, this is on Steam.
[112:27.28]I have to buy this on Steam?
[112:39.47]Hey Wiggly Joe, thanks for the 15 community subs.
[112:43.77]15 subs.
[112:44.55]You can if you want.
[112:45.42]Where do I get it?
[112:45.98]Where can I just play it?
[112:47.78]Is it on congregate?
[112:52.42]Sword and sandals?
[113:02.39]Where the hell is it?
[113:05.73]Swords and souls.
[113:07.21]Swords and sandals.
[113:10.24]Swords and Sandals Crusader.
[113:12.58]Swords and Sandals 1.
[113:13.96]Swords and Sandals 2.
[113:16.24]I guess I'm just going to do the first one.
[113:17.52]Loading game info.
[113:27.01]Okay.
[113:31.51]Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[113:35.82]Hold on.
[113:40.55]Is this game any good?
[113:52.82]Swords and Sandals 2, waiting room.
[113:54.32]But hold on.
[113:57.70]I just, I have, this is the first game.
[113:59.60]Can I even play the first one?
[114:09.92]Okay.
[114:11.50]Play.
[114:11.90]How to play.
[114:12.52]Click here to get an overview.
[114:14.46]Swords and Sandals is a... Oops.
[114:16.74]Is a mini-epic gladiator game.
[114:19.38]Wait, two is just the same thing, but better.
[114:24.99]It's just the exact same thing.
[114:27.59]Yes.
[114:28.07]Two is way better.
[114:28.83]Just play it.
[114:29.37]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[114:30.79]I've seen a couple of no's, but... I...
[114:38.99]Sword and Sandals 2, Emperor's Reign.
[114:40.75]Why are there different versions of this?
[114:43.23]Swords and Sandals 2.
[114:45.13]Why are there different versions?
[114:51.09]The game will start after this message.
[114:52.35]What message?
[114:56.91]The game brought to you by Third Sense.
[115:06.61]I have to zoom this in.
[115:09.74]Graphics on high, obviously.
[115:11.84]This is way too far.
[115:14.74]I need to go in closer.
[115:15.68]Hold on.
[115:20.03]Okay.
[115:20.41]Why is there a chat?
[115:30.13]I remember not being able to put games on high.
[115:34.00]Every game had to be, I had to right click every game and put it all, put like the shockwave player down to low.
[115:40.04]Because it would run at like two frames a second.
[115:45.16]Okay, that looks alright.
[115:45.98]Alright, let's go.
[115:47.29]How to play.
[115:48.33]Much has changed since Swords and Sandals 1 apparently chat.
[115:53.34]But for those who have played the first game, the basic premise is the same.
[115:58.30]Create your gladiator and battle your way to fame and fortune.
[116:02.12]Tool tips will guide you through the specifics of the game, but the basic pattern of the game is as follows.
[116:06.80]Create, build up your character, buy weapons, armor, spells, and potions, defeat gladiators to win experience and gold, and do it all over again.
[116:14.29]Okay?
[116:17.91]Your ultimate aim is to defeat all the arena champions and reign as champion yourself.
[116:21.89]Alright.
[116:27.78]Become a member of the Playaholics to save and load characters.
[116:32.57]I am not going to do that.
[116:35.71]Name.
[116:41.27]Uh, how about... Killer.
[116:47.16]The Killer.
[116:50.38]Yeah.
[116:51.58]The Killer.
[116:52.12]How about, um...
[116:58.55]Great.
[117:03.31]Uh... Tholomule.
[117:04.67]Tholomule.
[117:06.81]Tholomule.
[117:07.87]Okay.
[117:09.53]Uh... Oh.
[117:30.61]Well, I feel like this looks like a South Park character.
[117:33.87]Okay, uh, hairstyle.
[117:36.49]Should I give him the... Wait, I gotta find the Jerma985.
[117:42.69]These all could be Jerma985.
[117:44.21]I have different hair every day.
[117:48.26]Um... No, how about just, uh...
[118:00.63]I don't know.
[118:00.93]Should I do like the poop hair?
[118:08.76]No, that's too wild.
[118:13.52]Oh, Dragon Ball Z character.
[118:15.00]Yeah, like it's gonna be one of the Dragon Ball Z characters.
[118:17.08]The ones that like don't fight that much.
[118:20.95]They're like smaller.
[118:27.28]No, Piccolo fights all the time.
[118:30.46]There's a little green guy that doesn't fight all the time, right?
[118:35.97]Who's the little green guy that doesn't fight?
[118:40.23]Krillin.
[118:41.57]Yeah.
[118:42.15]What color is his hair?
[118:46.61]Dendi?
[118:47.87]Yeah, I don't know.
[118:48.81]What color is Dendi's hair?
[118:54.23]Do I have this right?
[118:54.83]Hold on.
[118:56.49]Dendy?
[118:57.81]Dendy.
[118:58.27]Okay, yeah, it's this guy.
[119:04.51]No, is it Dendy or is it Krillin?
[119:07.21]Who has, like, the hair?
[119:09.27]No, Krillin is... Yeah, it's Dendy, but is there a Dendy with, like... Is there a Dendy with, like, the hair?
[119:19.80]No, okay.
[119:20.70]I guess... Whatever.
[119:23.85]I love that.
[119:25.31]I like that.
[119:25.99]Okay.
[119:27.40]Okay, strength, agility, attack.
[119:29.38]Let's just make my character, right?
[119:33.90]Yeah.
[119:36.10]Okay, so the great STAR_ once said that if I had a character sheet in real life, every single point would be in luck and charisma, and I'd have a zero in everything else.
[119:50.13]So, I mean, I don't know how accurate that particularly is.
[119:54.44]But I feel like I'll lose every match.
[120:04.94]I wanted to be kind of strong.
[120:06.23]I don't even know what these do.
[120:08.43]Can I look?
[120:10.41]Strength.
[120:11.73]Definitely needs... Okay, stamina and vitality.
[120:14.11]What's the difference?
[120:17.63]5 strength, 2 agility, 3 attack.
[120:32.15]Is that going to work?
[120:35.49]I don't think that's going to do anything.
[120:37.57]I'm going to probably die.
[120:40.49]Tooltips are at the bottom.
[120:42.27]They are?
[120:44.53]Oh, shit, okay.
[120:46.17]Strength determines how much damage your character dishes out and your skill with axes and clubs.
[120:50.67]It also affects the height and weight of your character.
[120:53.14]Stronger characters can push weaker characters further.
[120:55.36]Okay, well, I'm not the biggest guy in the room, but, you know, I'm also not the smallest guy in the room, but I can keep that at a one.
[121:01.42]Agility represents your character's speed, skill with swords, and ranged weapons.
[121:04.31]Faster characters can move in and out of combat more easily and perform spectacular, acrobatic leaps.
[121:10.27]with my kind of medical stuff recently I haven't been able to move around too much like that fast or that much so having some you know trouble that's probably should be a one um attack your attack is overall offensive weapon skill gladiators with high attack scores tend to hit their enemies more often finding gaps in armor with masterful precision um I have trouble like opening up Amazon packages with like a pair of scissors
[121:33.11]I can never quite, like, cut the tape.
[121:35.14]And I end up, like, just ripping it up.
[121:36.44]I just grab the edges, and I just fucking pull as hard as I can.
[121:39.50]And the tape is starting to give, but it hasn't given yet.
[121:42.38]And I pull as hard as I fucking can until it just breaks.
[121:45.60]So I probably wouldn't be very good at that either.
[121:47.78]Defense is a vital part of protecting oneself in combat.
[121:50.72]High defensive stat means you'll get hit less.
[121:54.46]Uh...
[121:56.31]I mean, I do a lot of sitting.
[121:57.49]I just sit here.
[121:58.01]I mean, if you threw, like, a rock at my window right now, it'd go hit me right in the head, so I don't think I'd be very good at that either.
[122:04.11]Your vitality represents your overall health.
[122:06.63]That's one.
[122:08.27]Charisma reflects your overall charm and likability.
[122:10.77]Characters with high charisma please the crowd, winning you more gold for winning fights.
[122:15.60]Shopkeepers will lower their prices by 1% for every charisma point you have.
[122:21.39]I feel like I'm right at home here.
[122:23.73]I feel like I can do this pretty well.
[122:26.01]I feel like I have energy sometimes and I can really speak to a crowd of people.
[122:30.17]Are you guys ready?
[122:31.31]Are you excited for Jerma985's YouTube account?
[122:34.79]I think I should be 10.
[122:36.29]Stamina.
[122:38.31]Every leap, every parry or hack you perform in the air arena takes some of your energy.
[122:44.69]I got some energy.
[122:46.41]Well, no, I don't.
[122:46.95]I stream for like four hours.
[122:48.97]What about Magicka?
[122:50.90]You cannot harness the power of magicka in your combats.
[122:53.84]To cast magic spells and potions, you'll need a high magicka.
[122:57.32]Each magicka point you have also adds 1% resistance to magical damage.

[154:05.67]Oh, hi.
[154:06.69]As it has been some time since you've known a lady, you pluck up the courage to ask her out for a meal.
[154:12.11]Will you be extravagant, spoiling the lady with a fine restaurant, or take her for a simple meal at the tavern?
[154:18.54]I will take her for beers and snacks at a cheap tavern.
[154:21.38]I know I won't.
[154:24.53]Bear maiden is insulted and refuses to go with you.
[154:27.39]She storms off.

[160:45.26]You pluck up the courage to ask her for a meal.
[160:48.36]Will you be extravagant or just take her out for beers?
[160:50.90]Fifteen hundred gold?! !
[160:54.36]She accepts your offer, and that night you meet at one of the finest restaurants in town.
[160:58.36]The meal is splendid.
[160:59.10]The conversation flows, and soon enough, the next morning, the maiden gives you a kiss and a rose.
[161:03.15]You shall be her champion.

[220:03.66]I don't need them.
[220:14.40]I don't need them and I can't buy them anyways.
[220:27.23]This game looks better than Watch Dogs.
[220:28.69]I mean... God.
[220:33.88]That game.
[220:34.60]I swear to God.
[220:37.32]That's... Okay.
[220:38.16]That's not nominated for anything at the Game Awards, right?
[220:41.70]Is that nominated for even one award?
[220:44.68]I hope not.
[220:45.80]Is it?
[220:46.52]No, it's not.
[220:47.00]What is it nominated for?
[220:50.60]No, it is not.
[220:51.20]Bullshit.

[221:02.67]Where'd he go?
[221:05.63]What?
[221:16.82]Grandma, I worked so hard on that game.
[221:18.86]Stop, don't... Hey, that's not... Dude, quit hitting your bong.
[221:32.41]I don't think I could hit a bong, man.
[221:33.83]I really don't think I could in real life.
[221:35.29]I would probably fucking fall down.
[221:39.77]I would hit the bong, it'd be like...
[221:54.37]My head would just fucking hit the table.
[221:56.69]I'm not doing that.
[222:03.56]No, I want to be able to control exactly what I'm doing.
[222:05.66]Imagine how much I'm taking.
[222:17.27]Yeah, and why did I just do that like I was eating spaghetti?
[222:21.15]That was not a good bong sound.
[222:22.89]That was like you're slipping up like spaghetti and meatballs.
[222:27.90]What is that?
[222:33.96]This is... I'm not even having fun.
[222:36.92]This is just like screaming.
[222:38.18]I feel like I'm not even playing.
[222:40.33]I'm just like looking at you guys and talking.
[222:41.99]What?
[222:45.05]I've kept my mouse in the same place, I think, for the last four or five straight minutes.
[222:48.83]Play Doodle God?
[222:59.14]Oh, I played the absolute hell out of that a long time ago.
[223:02.60]Okay, Son of Stylonius.
[223:11.50]Not yet.
[223:21.95]They do look out right now.
[223:24.64]Link it to me!
[223:25.94]Turn off the stream.
[223:37.79]What?
[223:39.05]I'm not done yet.
[223:50.71]Trimmer hits the bong and dies.
[223:52.13]Hold on.
[223:52.51]Trimmer hits the bong and dies.
[223:59.11]Let's hear this.
[224:15.39]Oh, I'm... I gotta be...
[224:20.71]Not what I intended for that to sound like.
[224:22.07]I wanted that to sound like this.
[224:23.31]I wanted it to sound like this.
[224:28.92]For some reason, when I go through the stream, I don't know why, but I'm going to leave it on this for a little while.
[224:37.79]Mitch McCall.
[224:40.87]Hold on.
[224:41.39]Is it?
[224:41.99]Let's find out.
[224:44.04]Let me find out if it's... Let me find out.
[224:46.74]Let me find out.
[224:48.72]Now, let me tell you.
[224:51.90]I am not... Madam Secretary, I am not going to stand out here and not give a stimulus.
[224:58.75]No, no.
[224:59.41]The American people are going to be just fine.
[225:01.35]They're going to be fine.
[225:07.55]Mitch McConnell has a joker laugh, by the way.
[225:10.81]Listen to Mitch McConnell laugh at something.
[225:12.46]He does the Jared Leto Joker.
[225:16.74]Seriously, it's like... How do you laugh like that?
[225:33.43]Think about people that, you know, when you laugh, you just go... Or like...
[225:39.62]That's political?
[225:49.08]Political.
[225:49.52]Alright, here he comes.
[226:00.56]Son of Stylonius.
[226:03.27]Scream at him.
[226:04.43]I win.
[226:04.85]Scream at him.
[226:05.49]I win.
[226:06.25]Scream at him.
[226:06.95]I win.
[226:07.37]Nice fart.
[226:07.95]I can match your fart with a fart too.
[226:09.33]You want to get farts on?
[226:10.17]Alright, fine.
[226:13.79]Let's go.
[226:20.18]Oh, he's charging something.
[226:22.12]Nice.
[226:22.56]Okay.
[226:22.92]You missed.
[226:34.04]People are wildly entertained by that too.
[226:36.66]Oh, he's burnt.
[226:44.13]Burned.
[226:45.73]I'm going to piss on him.
[226:47.29]You can't even pee on people in this game.
[226:49.75]And if you can, I don't know.
[226:51.17]I'm not going to probably unlock it yet.
[227:05.85]I won.
[227:09.05]Congratulations, you have won.
[227:10.32]I feel like I didn't win anything.
[227:13.84]I kind of feel like I have not been in the arena yet.
[227:19.81]Okay.
[227:20.49]Emperor Antares has granted you 22,500 gold.
[227:22.09]Thank you.
[227:28.67]The hour is late.
[227:30.23]Okay, find a tavern.
[227:31.73]Sleep peacefully.
[227:33.43]A6.
[227:33.91]Alright, that was fun.
[227:46.95]I'm going to move on to Doodle God now.
[227:50.61]Let's do Doodle God.
[227:53.07]This game is cool, but I don't know.
[227:55.15]I don't want to just yell at people for another hour or something.
[227:58.40]That's too much.
[228:00.56]I like it.
[228:00.94]It's a really fun game.
[228:01.76]And I remember it.
[228:02.40]It's very nostalgic.
[228:04.85]But we are going to do this.
[228:12.47]Doodle God.
[228:15.41]I remember this game.
[228:17.90]Might be a little too big.
[228:20.70]Let's make it a little bit smaller.
[228:23.74]Okay.
[228:25.86]A little.
[228:26.50]Just a little.
[228:27.24]Okay.
[228:29.62]Remember, you normally just yell at us for hours.
[228:31.34]What?
[228:31.50]No, I don't.
[228:32.98]You do that to me.
[228:33.40]Alright, Doodle God, play.
[228:37.26]You can now play Doodle God on your phone.
[228:39.66]Check it out.
[228:40.40]iPhone version has priority in getting updates.
[228:45.00]In the beginning, there was only Doodle God.
[228:49.13]Doodle God created the four basic elements.
[228:51.09]Earth, water, fire, air.
[228:55.03]From Earth, Doodle God created the planets.
[229:00.83]From water, seas, and oceans were created.
[229:04.71]From fire were created volcanoes and other stuff.
[229:08.38]And from air, you know.
[229:10.32]The world is still vast.
[229:11.60]I know what the game is.
[229:12.34]Okay, here we go.
[229:14.62]We're going to do fire.
[229:15.86]And we're going to do Earth.
[229:18.98]And that is going to make...
[229:21.78]stone lava if your heart is a volcano how shall you expect flowers to bloom they get quotes okay cool there's a new element in the group now yeah there is now we have lava we can do lava and Earth Earth and lava equals the same thing Earth and fire do how about air and lava steam stone
[229:50.10]We have stone and water equals sand.
[229:58.52]Cool.
[229:58.94]Now we can do, let's do air.
[230:03.32]Air and sand.
[230:05.83]Air and Earth creates dust.
[230:09.75]How about fire and sand?
