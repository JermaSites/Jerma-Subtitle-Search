[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.49]Hold on now.
[00:02.05]Hold on.
[00:02.45]Just a second here.
[00:05.22]I need to go like this.
[00:11.96]Okay.
[00:13.16]So we are going without notifications tonight.
[00:17.93]So there will be no sub or bit notifications on the screen because obviously this is Jerma Wrestling.
[00:24.23]This is Jermania 2018.
[00:31.97]I'm gonna give it a little bit for people to show up because I heard that there were some issues with Twitch.
[00:38.98]I don't know how widespread they are.
[00:41.68]I don't know how fucked up they are.
[00:44.27]But I want to make sure that this stream actually goes through to people and, you know, works.
[00:56.39]So give me just a moment.
[00:58.37]I know I wanted to start originally like 20 or 30 minutes ago, but we're gonna take a little bit of time.
[01:06.89]So I wanted to make sure I was done before 5 Pacific, because that's too long.
[01:11.75]But it's ready.
[01:12.47]It's done.
[01:12.91]It's ready to go.
[01:15.17]So just give me a moment.
[01:17.05]We'll talk.
[01:17.45]Actually, we could bring up a couple of things before this starts.
[01:20.43]You know, I'm gonna milk the absolute hell out of this.
[01:22.85]You know what I mean?
[01:23.75]Hold on a second.
[01:24.57]Let's talk about a few things.
[01:26.89]Because the stream is probably only going to be two or three hours long.
[01:32.19]Because, you know, it is what it is.
[01:34.76]But give me one second.
[01:36.26]I will be right back.
[01:39.34]Ta-ta for a second.
[02:11.91]Shouldn't I be a little more excited for this?
[02:18.09]The rumble is here!
[02:21.75]I'm like, okay guys, let's talk about a few things, first of all.
[02:29.02]Okay, so let's go over just a few stream-related things.
[02:32.41]No, but this is very, very, very important.
[02:35.57]Next weekend is the green screen movie night.
[02:40.60]Now, if you have not submitted your piece of art, then I advise you to do so before the 29th.
[02:51.99]If you are curious of the rules, they're all posted in that Discord channel.
[02:56.21]There's a pinned message.
[02:57.29]Go read on the green screen submission channel.
[03:01.06]There's a pinned bunch of rules.
[03:02.60]Read them.
[03:02.92]You gotta have your video on YouTube.
[03:04.74]It's gotta be uploaded to YouTube.
[03:06.88]No Reddit videos, no Discord videos.
[03:09.14]It's gonna go into a giant YouTube playlist.
[03:13.21]So, please go read those rules.
[03:15.35]I want to make sure I say that again because we're doing that next weekend.
[03:18.79]So, if you're like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[03:20.85]Just go take a look.
[03:22.49]Pin message.
[03:25.05]Alright.
[03:27.35]So, I was at Starbucks today.
[03:30.37]And man, what's the deal with their large?
[03:33.77]You know what I mean?
[03:34.51]It's like not even bigger than the medium.
[03:37.02]It's like two ounces bigger.
[03:42.98]Are you guys ready?
[03:43.52]Are you guys ready to do this?
[03:44.80]Okay, the reason why I'm stalling.
[03:48.80]It's only been four minutes.
[03:49.84]What?
[03:50.28]I'm not even stalling.
[03:52.38]But here's the reason why.
[03:54.10]The last couple times I've done this, a bunch of people have missed the first two matches or so because, oh shit, I got a notification.
[04:02.43]The stream just started.
[04:05.43]I spent like 44 hours on this, so I'm going to milk it.
[04:08.41]I'm going to sit here and talk about my Starbucks trip.
[04:18.04]Play a 10-minute drum roll.
[04:22.78]Uh, by the way, um, there are, there are 36 characters.
[04:29.62]And I think only two or three of them are returning characters.
[04:34.90]I went, I went fucking crazy and just made 35, 34 people.
[04:37.96]So, there's a, it's not, let me put it this way, it's not just like
[04:49.07]Because, you know, usually I spend a lot of time on these.
[04:52.75]But, you know, I got the complaints about Falco, about Wolf, about Star Fox.
[04:57.50]I got the complaints about it.
[05:01.18]Nobody wants to see seven serpents in a rumble.
[05:08.05]So... There are no clones.
[05:12.67]Well, actually, hold on a minute.
[05:13.89]That might not be entirely true.
[05:19.94]and everybody's here except for everyone beside like from like a year ago none of them are there from like a year and a half ago it's all people from the last year so everyone from this last year is here except for the everybody else there you go alright what do you say we get it done let's start gymania 2018 what told you I was gonna look I told you I was gonna get done before December
[05:47.83]Everyone was yelling at me.
[05:49.31]Oh, there's no way he is going to have enough time.
[05:51.81]Oh, yeah?
[05:55.16]36 fucking characters.
[05:56.38]Can you hear it?
[05:59.82]You can hear it.
[06:00.28]I don't know.
[06:00.74]I don't want to spoil it.
[06:01.52]Hopefully this is set up correctly.
[06:02.90]If not, I'm going to fucking shit my pants.
[06:06.63]But anyways.
[06:08.21]Welcome, everybody.
[06:11.43]Torture Mania 2018.
[06:27.18]Here we are!
[06:29.48]Where are we?
[06:30.10]Hey, where do you think we are?
[06:30.84]Where do you think we are right now?
[06:33.26]I'll tell you where we are.
[06:34.58]We're in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada!
[06:38.48]Just waiting for it to pop up on the screen to prove that I'm in Las Vegas.
[06:43.48]San Diego!
[06:44.49]Hey!
[06:45.19]What?
[06:48.39]San Diego!
[06:50.47]That's not real.
[06:55.97]There we are, ladies and gentlemen, in San Diego.
[06:59.77]I turned the music off.
[07:01.27]I don't want this.
[07:02.19]I'm gonna get copyright strike.
[07:03.58]Alright, here we go.
[07:13.12]It's time for it to begin.
[07:15.51]First match of the evening coming up right now.
[07:18.65]It's an Extreme Rules match.
[07:20.87]One on one.
[07:24.07]I fucking hate this music.
[07:28.60]Don't delete me.
[07:29.76]How do I, like, hold on.
[07:30.94]I gotta, like, be really, really loud.
[07:34.00]Because this is gonna mute the VOD.
[07:39.33]Don't delete this.
[07:43.20]But anyways, guys, welcome to the first match of the evening.
[07:45.98]This is one that I'm going to put this to rest forever.
[07:49.59]I cannot wait until this argument that I've made for the last almost full fucking year is just stupid at this point.
[07:58.21]And you'll see what I'm talking about.
[08:00.29]Oh, you didn't do it.
[08:00.99]You didn't do it.
[08:01.45]You didn't kill this guy.
[08:02.51]You didn't beat this guy first try.
[08:04.71]That's fine.
[08:05.79]We'll find out tonight what really is going on.
[08:11.08]Because we got the first match of the evening out of five total here Is Jerva985 In a one-on-one match Looking old as shit Losing his hair, that's what I look like right now Somebody just went, ow!
[08:31.69]Jerva985 is uh Getting a little higher in age as I just said 30 uh 33 I feel 53
[08:41.64]And it's funny, because every time we do one of these rumbles, I always make me how I currently feel.
[08:51.02]That's how I feel right now.
[08:51.99]Like, the last time I was, like, fat, and you did boo me, and that's fine.
[08:56.13]You boo me on my own channel, I don't give a shit.
[08:59.87]But who could I be facing to finally put this bullshit to rest forever?
[09:11.01]Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent for the first match of the evening is one of the easiest bosses in Dark Souls.
[09:20.47]That's right, we're talking about a person that I absolutely did not lose to.
[09:23.83]That's Pinwheel!
[09:27.41]Extreme rules, one-on-one.
[09:31.94]Will I beat Pinwheel again without dying?
[09:34.26]Because that's what I did.
[09:44.18]Will I do it?
[09:45.71]And then we can stop this.
[09:47.27]Whatever happens here on out.
[09:51.67]If I lose, I'll accept it.
[09:53.52]If I win, you all gotta stop that shit.
[09:55.22]This ain't even a meme stream, but I'm telling you.
[10:00.33]We're making the cannon tonight.
[10:04.96]Go get him.
[10:06.12]Go get him!
[10:07.52]What is he doing?
[10:08.18]He's being a... I don't know.
[10:10.67]He's being a slow Dark Souls boss.
[10:12.73]An easy boss.
[10:14.13]But I will absolutely beat within five minutes.
[10:17.77]Because I'm the one in control.
[10:20.64]As you'll see very plainly.
[10:21.58]But I've gotten older.
[10:22.48]No entrance music.
[10:23.68]And there's a very good reason for that.
[10:26.01]Apparently, you can get in trouble with copyrighted music these days, so I've heard.
[10:31.19]No entrance music.
[10:34.67]Really is.
[10:41.54]Let's go!
[10:42.54]Hurry up!
[10:43.10]Get the fuck in there, pinwheel!
[10:45.80]He has taken a long time.
[10:50.70]What?
[10:51.08]Jerma's outside the ring getting ready.
[10:53.67]Starting his new exercise routine, while Pinwheel really milks this intro for good measure.
[11:01.97]What a good way to make sure everybody gets here.
[11:04.47]And there it's all angry, oh dear, you suck, you lost to Pinwheel!
[11:07.47]No, I didn't.
[11:08.65]And I'm about to prove it right now.
[11:10.39]Welcome to Jermedia 2018.
[11:12.83]Ring the bell, one-on-one extreme rules, Jerma versus Pinwheel!
[11:17.46]Couple of right-handed punches there to start.
[11:20.02]Jerma is old, but can still hang with a young kid.
[11:23.44]Right into the turnbuckle, his face goes twice.
[11:25.34]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[11:30.76]Eleven times.
[11:34.43]Ooh, Jerma with a little stomp there, but he missed.
[11:36.68]Got him in a headlock.
[11:37.76]No, he's going to go... Ooh, elbow to the face.
[11:40.00]Pinwheel now on the reversal.
[11:41.82]Into the corner, Jerma goes.
[11:43.10]Pinwheel.
[11:43.60]Uh-oh.
[11:44.82]He's turning him upside down.
[11:46.70]He's tying him.
[11:48.00]He's tying Jerma to the turnbuckle and now stepping on his face.
[11:53.54]That was an interesting tree of woe there by Pinwheel.
[11:56.42]Is that made out of concrete?
[11:59.59]That's not going to win.
[12:00.47]No, no, no.
[12:00.93]That's one.
[12:01.91]That...
[12:02.88]There's no way I'm going to lose that one.
[12:05.28]I'm not going to get pinned after getting my hit.
[12:07.10]Oh, what a beautiful breakdance move into a Jerma suplex by Jerma.
[12:10.81]Absolutely fantastic.
[12:13.79]You can hear the crowd, half of them really getting behind me, half of them yelling about how short I am.
[12:20.17]And another 200 people screaming about how I lost.
[12:24.64]You can really hear the, oh, what a miss by Pinwheel there.
[12:27.82]Can Jerma capitalize on it?
[12:30.12]No, he's gonna get... Oh, what a reverse neckbreaker there by Pinwheel on Jirba985.
[12:35.10]He dropped to 985 recently in recent years.
[12:37.18]I'm not sure why that is.
[12:39.14]Maybe it's because... No!
[12:40.26]Ooh!
[12:41.60]Beautiful reversal.
[12:42.59]Maybe it's because numbers... Back in the day of YouTube where everybody had a numbered channel.
[12:48.05]But you didn't even really... I don't know why.
[12:49.73]People had their birthdays.
[12:51.87]Why would you ever put your birthday online for a bunch of people to see?
[12:55.45]And now it looks like Jirba is gonna try the same technique on Pinwheel!
[12:59.54]The crowd didn't really like that, but it wasn't gonna be enough.
[13:01.62]Let's see, one!
[13:03.14]No, only one.
[13:05.60]Only one.
[13:06.10]Now this, remember, this is an Extreme Rules matchup.
[13:08.82]So that means... I'm pretty sure... Whoa!
[13:14.52]What a Hurricane Ron, a springboard!
[13:17.02]We saw him do these moves in the green screen.
[13:18.60]Now he's setting up for a special move, I think.
[13:21.02]Yep, it's called the Whoops-a-Daisy!
[13:22.92]That's old Jerma's special technique, the Whoops-a-Daisy.
[13:27.37]He grabs you by the wrist and just falls backwards as you lie down on your back too.
[13:32.79]Jerma into the corner.
[13:33.83]Are we going to see?
[13:34.43]Uh-oh.
[13:36.39]Are we going to see it?
[13:37.93]Are we going to see the diaper?
[13:38.87]No, that wasn't the diaper.
[13:39.91]I thought it was going to be the diaper.
[13:42.39]That was the double-fisted.
[13:43.53]Uh-oh, he's going to the top rope.
[13:45.65]Got up there real quickly.
[13:48.03]What are we going to see from Jerma?
[13:50.37]Oh!
[13:50.89]The stomp!
[13:52.59]The step on your chest!
[13:54.65]And that's gotta be it!
[13:56.31]That has to be it!
[13:57.23]One!
[13:58.32]Two!
[14:00.04]Oh!
[14:00.28]Just barely!
[14:01.12]He didn't make it!
[14:01.74]Pinwheel just barely got out of that one.
[14:06.62]I think somebody better check his shoes.
[14:09.52]Somebody check Jeremy's shoes.
[14:11.13]I think there's fucking weights in there.
[14:13.65]He might be cheating!
[14:15.78]He doesn't want to be lambasted and accused and made fun of for the rest of his life.
[14:20.37]People are cheering.
[14:21.07]Pinwheel now.
[14:21.55]He's got him in a submission lock.
[14:23.09]Is Jerma going to... No!
[14:24.75]He... Oh, I thought he tapped out for a second.
[14:27.33]I was about to scream.
[14:30.84]Oh, out to the outside we go.
[14:32.38]And Jerma's feeling the adrenaline.
[14:34.66]You can just smell his armpits from here.
[14:37.32]They smell like dove men plus care.
[14:39.40]And he's going to the top rope.
[14:40.90]He's pointing down.
[14:41.70]This is a daredevil move here from Jerma.
[14:44.72]Wheelie, what's he gonna do?
[14:45.68]Holy shit!
[14:49.36]I don't know why that was so unnecessary.
[14:51.04]That hurt Jerma probably more than it hurt Pinwheel.
[14:54.69]All I did was hurt my legs.
[14:57.23]Why wouldn't you kick him?
[14:58.33]Why wouldn't you jump on him?
[15:00.71]And now a DDT into the concrete.
[15:04.72]And he stepped on his balls too.
[15:06.58]For good measure.
[15:07.28]Are we gonna get a pin on the outside?
[15:08.62]Where are they taking this?
[15:10.78]Just too extremely tal- Uh-oh.
[15:14.60]Pinwheel is going underneath the- And he's got a pool cue.
[15:18.51]No, he doesn't want it.
[15:19.51]I don't want that.
[15:20.69]He didn't- Oh!
[15:21.65]Big mistake.
[15:22.29]A capitalization from Jerma.
[15:23.37]The slap.
[15:25.29]Is he going to go into the- No, it's a reversal.
[15:27.47]Back down.
[15:28.21]I'm not sure why he picked up that pool cue there.
[15:30.79]He's not even going to use it.
[15:31.72]I think he- I don't think he wants to cheat.
[15:34.38]I think he wants to beat Jerma fair and square.
[15:36.16]I'm like, uh-oh.
[15:37.80]I think Jerma might be dead.
[15:39.85]Jerma's face just erupted.
[15:41.83]The red marker means you're in trouble.
[15:43.59]Is Jerma going to tap out here?
[15:44.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[15:45.17]He's not going to tap out.
[15:46.21]He's not going to tap out.
[15:46.91]Jerma's got more perseverance than this.
[15:48.77]Good reversal there by Jerma.
[15:52.11]As the referee is standing there awkwardly just trying to figure out what to do about this whole thing.
[15:56.79]And they're going up the alley.
[15:59.21]Jerma gets thrown into the entranceway.
[16:02.93]I think he might have a headache.
[16:03.77]Trying to get back in.
[16:04.67]Both going at the same time.
[16:06.17]The pool cue is still on the ground.
[16:07.50]Nice DDT.
[16:09.66]Perfectly executed.
[16:10.64]And Jerma is bleeding from the head.
[16:15.02]Did Jerma get... He didn't... What happened?
[16:17.18]Oh, right into the concrete.
[16:18.16]That's right.
[16:19.78]Ooh, two clotheslines.
[16:21.40]Three clotheslines.
[16:22.55]Will it be enough?
[16:23.23]Is he going to go for a pin potentially here?
[16:24.59]No, he's going to pick him up.
[16:27.61]And punch him in the face.
[16:29.21]Does Jerma know any other moves?
[16:31.61]A reverse suplex.
[16:33.05]Ooh.
[16:34.37]That was a reverse suplex.
[16:36.03]Could that be it?
[16:36.55]That's gonna be it, I think.
[16:38.29]One!
[16:39.41]Two!
[16:40.64]Three!
[16:40.84]That's it!
[16:41.58]That's it!
[16:43.22]Jerva beats Pinwheel first try!
[16:46.90]He got him with the reverse suplex!
[16:51.26]And everybody's booing, and they can boo all they want.
[16:54.52]It's proven.
[16:56.36]That's it.
[16:57.00]No more of this bullshit.
[16:58.43]I beat Pinwheel on stream first try.
[17:01.65]Look at all these awesome moves that I did I was surprised that the double stomp diaper trash did not seal the deal there for him We did have a nice move by Pinwheel here, it was a DDT People in the audience right now, in the arena are screaming right now Hold on, Jerma's got something to say See, first try, he's holding up the one finger, first try
[17:32.12]I'm as angry as he is.
[17:35.96]He's taunting Twitch chat right now, saying, yeah, like, look what I did.
[17:45.22]By the way, that's an actual picture of my face.
[17:47.72]Just in case anyone was wondering.
[17:52.94]Moving on to the next match.
[17:54.92]We've got, uh, this is going to be a fan favorite one here.
[17:58.06]After Jerma very, very clearly beats Pinwheel first try.
[18:08.72]Pre-recorded and rigged.
[18:09.98]No, we're watching it live.
[18:14.34]Hey, scream over the... Hold on.
[18:16.28]There we go.
[18:16.98]I can just do that.
[18:17.42]Now we don't have to worry about the VOD getting deleted.
[18:20.82]But the next one coming up is going to be quite an interesting match.
[18:25.64]It is a six-man ladder match.
[18:30.35]Six people in the ring have to climb up to the top and grab the briefcase.
[18:35.49]Six people.
[18:44.30]I wonder who's going to win this one.
[18:48.49]Oh, it's still loading.
[18:49.53]A lot of people are in this one.
[18:59.11]Well, might as well bring it up here.
[19:02.11]We've had a short little intermission.
[19:04.27]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the six-man ladder match.
[19:12.10]The six participants are a lot of people that you guys know.
[19:17.34]There's the Money in the Bank.
[19:18.82]It's two $20 bills.
[19:21.12]I said there's like 100 grand in there, but I lied.
[19:23.22]And there's Chuck Schnoswell!
[19:25.14]Contestant number one.
[19:29.29]In the Money in the Bank six-man.
[19:34.69]Grab the briefcase challenge.
[19:38.77]Chuck Schnauzwell, one of the murderers of The Sims murder house.
[19:44.69]And you probably could guess who the other five contestants are.
[19:48.08]Maybe you can't.
[19:52.20]Everybody loves Chuck.
[19:54.74]The Schnauz, as they call him in the locker room.
[19:58.56]Because he's got really great teeth.
[20:02.03]That's what they say.
[20:09.86]Oh, Twitch chat really seems to like that.
[20:11.68]I wonder... Oh, hold on a minute.
[20:13.42]Who's the next contestant in the six-man ladder match?
[20:16.94]Six-man?
[20:17.54]Why don't you add six-woman?
[20:20.47]That's D56TAFO98.
[20:23.65]One of the other members of The Sims Murder House.
[20:28.87]D56.
[20:31.43]Very adamant on coming in here and winning.
[20:38.78]Landed on this planet.
[20:41.58]10 years ago.
[20:42.08]Nice slide!
[20:44.70]You can't practice that five times.
[20:47.12]B56 trying to show off to the crowd.
[20:48.70]Get some people to back her endeavor here.
[20:57.97]You got to let them have at least a few minutes in the ring.
[20:59.67]You know what I mean?
[21:01.71]You can't skip their beloved entrance.
[21:06.16]Contestant number three coming in here.
[21:08.18]No, no, she's got more to say!
[21:12.10]No.
[21:12.66]Well, I can't really hear what she's saying.
[21:14.52]Because she's not mic'd up.
[21:16.31]But anyways, here comes the third contestant in the... And they're getting booed here.
[21:21.45]There are loud boos coming in for Fru-Fru.
[21:28.62]And if you could wildly... If you could guess... Yeah.
[21:35.82]This is... They're all here.
[21:38.93]Fru-Fru.
[21:41.18]One of the worst people in the whole house.
[21:43.90]Nobody liked him.
[21:44.50]I don't like him.
[21:46.00]And people ironically like him, but he sucks.
[21:50.12]I hope he doesn't win.
[21:56.01]I'm glad he's getting booed.
[21:57.91]Nice anime stance.
[21:58.89]He's a big fan of anime.
[22:00.13]That's what he says.
[22:00.77]But that's what they say in the locker room.
[22:07.25]You know, because of his hat.
[22:11.68]I like him.
[22:12.45]I like him.
[22:13.01]Well, that's fine.
[22:15.45]He's ready.
[22:16.85]Contestant number four.
[22:20.89]Let's see who it is.
[22:23.02]That's Gavrit.
[22:26.10]Gavrit from the murder house.
[22:31.54]Just kind of a regular guy with a weirdly shaped head.
[22:33.79]There wasn't really anything crazy about him.
[22:41.15]He's practicing his Sims dance, because they are Sims, right?
[22:45.55]That is very important for you to realize.
[22:47.02]They've been computer-generated scanned into the Jerma wrestling universe.
[22:53.16]You think you'd have any other moves besides put your fists out back and forth?
[23:01.87]Get him the fuck out of here.
[23:09.71]By the way, that t-shirt took like an hour and 40 minutes to make.
[23:13.87]So, let's just be real about that.
[23:15.75]That's not in the game.
[23:22.09]Coming up next, number five.
[23:25.25]After Garrett.
[23:28.21]I really hope that people are prepared for this one.
[23:31.60]It's Adam Sandler!
[23:34.52]He's coming out doing his patented...
[23:44.97]He's known for that.
[23:46.75]One of the most talented comedians of our generation.
[23:50.53]Probably ten generations.
[23:56.86]Such comedic routines as Baby Noise.
[24:02.86]Does the same weird voice.
[24:06.50]And thinks they're way funnier than they are.
[24:11.40]And no, I'm not describing me.
[24:13.08]I mean, I am.
[24:13.82]But... I mean... Look, he's a fucking funny guy, okay?
[24:20.63]He's really talented.
[24:21.69]He's really funny.
[24:25.57]And this commentator's coming to a very strong realization right in the middle of it.
[24:30.23]Don't matter.
[24:30.93]Somebody said that before, didn't they?
[24:32.47]It doesn't matter.
[24:32.97]Here comes Wally Wheat.
[24:33.95]Wally Wheat's the real contestant.
[24:35.35]And he's gonna wipe the floor with all these motherfuckers in the ring.
[24:41.54]Here are your six.
[24:44.90]The Sims rumble.
[24:46.94]The Sims murder house ladder match.
[24:50.62]These people in this ring right now.
[24:53.08]All of them are insane.
[24:54.92]They will kill.
[24:56.80]They will kill.
[24:58.57]They have no problem with it.
[25:01.23]Half of them are not even from this planet.
[25:04.05]Dangerous people.
[25:05.07]Incredibly dangerous people.
[25:11.89]What do you say you ring that bell?
[25:13.75]Six-man ladder match, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:15.31]The Sims Murder House.
[25:16.43]Chuck wasting no time.
[25:18.59]He's going outside to go to the ladder.
[25:20.54]Adam Sandler now with a reversal on D56.
[25:23.64]Chuck does not want this to last long.
[25:26.14]He's got the ladder all ready.
[25:27.52]It hadn't even been 10 seconds.
[25:28.90]While FruFru is going to see if he can make that a different story.
[25:33.04]Well, head to the apron outside the ring for Chuck.
[25:36.23]Adam Sandler now with the offensive.
[25:37.77]There are no teams here.
[25:39.17]Keep that in mind.
[25:40.47]Nobody is on any team.
[25:42.72]Whoever gets to the top of that ladder first wins.
[25:45.37]Now Adam's saying... Doing his patented funny noise.
[25:49.05]Let me see if I can top him.
[25:51.73]Let me see if I can top him.
[25:53.19]Hey, it's me, it's me.
[25:54.05]It's me, it's me.
[25:56.02]We're not so different, you and I, Adam.
[25:58.68]Adam's just...
[26:03.67]Adam Sandler goes over the top ropes.
[26:06.67]And now they're outside while D-56 is got Adam Sandler by the head.
[26:14.15]Smashing his head into the steps.
[26:18.30]Well, Garrett.
[26:19.66]Something we didn't know about Garrett.
[26:20.96]He seems to be a pretty talented submission artist.
[26:24.20]While FruFru is on the outside trying to get his composure.
[26:28.54]No one has touched the ladder or anything else for that matter.
[26:32.42]Well, speaking of the devil here, Wally Wheat's got the ladder going over to Garrett.
[26:36.34]No, Garrett's gonna rip it out of his hands.
[26:38.65]No, I don't know what the deal is with that.
[26:40.05]Why do they put it down?
[26:41.07]You have a weapon.
[26:42.43]You're a bloodthirsty murderer.
[26:44.89]Use it.
[26:46.43]What a wonderful bulldog by DF5694.
[26:52.05]Whatever your name is.
[26:53.34]You're not supposed to be able to understand it.
[26:55.00]It's not even English.
[26:55.64]It's like a weird alien.
[26:57.34]It's a weird alien dialect.
[26:59.68]Garrett with, oh, what a reversal by D56.
[27:04.66]And a scoop slam coming up.
[27:05.78]No!
[27:06.70]Is D56 gonna dump him over the rails?
[27:09.52]No!
[27:10.70]She holds back.
[27:12.18]She does hold back.
[27:13.95]As Wally Wheat now in the corner.
[27:15.17]Chuck Schnoswell.
[27:17.07]It seems that they've all been training vigorously.
[27:20.51]Oh, what a pose by FruFru!
[27:23.73]That's the... You gotta... You have to get him out of the ring.
[27:25.45]You know what I'm saying?
[27:26.85]There's six people.
[27:28.51]No one's ever gonna climb to the top of this thing.
[27:30.14]You gotta throw him over the top.
[27:31.24]You gotta go get a weapon.
[27:33.31]Go grab like a grenade or something.
[27:36.21]And now we've got three in the ring.
[27:39.17]This could end very quickly.
[27:40.69]Garrett thought about it for a second.
[27:41.75]Now we're going to get the ladder.
[27:43.03]Garrett's got the ladder.
[27:43.99]No, I don't want that.
[27:46.19]I think I'd rather pick this guy up like a backpack.
[27:48.69]Oh, that's the backpack.
[27:49.89]That's Garrett's special move.
[27:52.81]I can't believe we just saw that.
[27:53.99]That's the backpack.
[27:56.11]Adam Sandler now coming in with a couple of punches.
[27:58.19]What a reversal by Garrett.
[28:01.38]Garrett is on fire here.
[28:04.48]If I'm going to make a bet here, I'm going to say Garrett's going to be the one to take the money in that briefcase and win the murder house... drawl, as we're going to call it.
[28:12.52]What a fireman's carry.
[28:14.08]Knee smash to the spinal column.
[28:15.48]That's the name of her move.
[28:16.30]That's her special move!
[28:18.08]That's her special move!
[28:20.54]As D56 is going to grab... No!
[28:21.94]And finally we get to see the ladder used.
[28:26.86]D56 is going pretty much all in on Adam Sandler.
[28:31.07]Oh, it gets taken, and nobody's really trying to do anything with the ladder besides small pushes to somebody's face.
[28:38.85]We could see blood here.
[28:41.75]Dean56 now.
[28:42.25]Trying to work that bad knee on Chuck Schnoswell.
[28:47.70]Because his nose is so large, other parts of his body are weaker.
[28:52.08]He's got bad knees, bad elbows, but he's got a real strong fucking nose.
[28:56.02]Garrett now.
[28:58.02]Has got the lad... Didn't even phase her at first.
[29:00.74]That was a little odd.
[29:03.22]Dropping the ladder again.
[29:04.12]Garrett's going for Chuck Schnosswell into the corner.
[29:06.96]He's facing the... Ooh, what an elbow to stop that.
[29:09.90]Oh, another reversal.
[29:13.26]They all trained in the same dojo, by the way.
[29:15.28]From what I'm being told on my desk here.
[29:18.12]When they first got there... What?
[29:19.97]She throws it over the top ropes!
[29:22.66]Essentially handing it to somebody on the outside.
[29:25.54]Adam Sandler contemplating his next movie script.
[29:27.91]Will it involve a giant Pac-Man?
[29:29.07]I'm not sure, but it's going to involve a broken neck!
[29:31.57]Nice reverse back neck breaker by Adam Sandler.
[29:35.75]And a Russian Leg Sweeper, too.
[29:37.39]We've got a problem here, though.
[29:38.75]Chuck Schnoswell on the top with... D-56.
[29:41.87]It's going to be a superplex.
[29:44.52]Off the top turnbuckle!
[29:46.12]Oh, that's a broken alien spine.
[29:52.29]G is out.
[29:53.41]G is out cold.
[29:56.05]Maybe not.
[29:58.14]But what I was going to say is they all trained at the same dojo from what I got on my paper here.
[30:02.68]And weirdly enough, they were thrown out of every dojo.
[30:06.11]They ended up going to some back alley dojo.
[30:09.71]It's not even sanctioned.
[30:12.01]It's not even, you know, it's not... It's not like unionized.
[30:17.77]It's just like it was an alleyway that they were allowed in because they kept bringing glass tubes.
[30:22.32]They were bringing knives into the other dojos to try to fight each other.
[30:25.52]And they were just like throwing the fuck out.
[30:26.82]People were saying, you can't bring those in here.
[30:30.96]So they ended up getting trained by an unnamed sensei.
[30:38.55]and uh that they're the sensei question mark and I'm not that's actually the word question space mark that's the person's name so anyway garrett's going up there just barely everyone just kind of stopped doing something for a minute here no no no no garrett's gonna get that is he gonna get that money does did garrett just sneakily no he stopped that garrett almost just sneakily got up there and picked up that entire that was insane
[31:09.34]I can't believe they just almost let that happen.
[31:11.10]And now Chuck has got the ladder.
[31:14.06]We are seeing fatigue settle in right now.
[31:20.10]As Chuck is going to try to get the ring cleared.
[31:23.30]There goes D56.
[31:24.88]Chuck Schnoswell is going up there.
[31:27.14]Will it be enough?
[31:29.02]Wally Wheat is out cold.
[31:31.26]Chuck Schnoswell's got the briefcase.
[31:33.30]Is he gonna... Oh, they're gonna help.
[31:35.18]They're gonna work together.
[31:36.00]Oh, just hit Adam Sandler in the face.
[31:40.58]I can't believe they actually work together.
[31:44.10]Oh, not for long.
[31:45.06]Not anymore.
[31:47.94]And the alliances stop right there.
[31:51.17]Molly Wade is getting killed by the ladder.
[31:54.21]Garrett now is going to make another attempt here.
[31:56.73]Is he going to be able to get up there?
[31:58.59]This could be it.
[32:00.17]Garrett's got to chase.
[32:01.39]What a punch to Adam Sandler's face.
[32:04.47]Come on, D56.
[32:05.21]You got to get up there.
[32:06.62]Garrett's going to get it.
[32:07.70]Garrett's going to get it.
[32:09.69]No!
[32:12.37]Is this gonna be it?
[32:14.59]Garrett is on the edge.
[32:15.65]They're both on the edge.
[32:16.97]Garrett just fell off while he weaned out.
[32:19.51]Can D56... Can she make the attempt?
[32:23.50]Uh-oh.
[32:24.60]He... No!
[32:26.30]She...
[32:33.44]Why did she step down?
[32:35.49]Why did she step down off the ladder?
[32:39.77]Anyway, oh.
[32:42.31]And now we've got a forward object in the middle of the ring here.
[32:46.89]FruFru is now going absolute ham on the back of D-56 with that big piece of steel.
[32:53.24]Adam Sandler just keeps finding his way outside and getting hurt outside.
[32:56.92]Ooh, what a clobber into the forehead.
[33:02.42]That at least 30 pounds of steel.
[33:06.32]Not even gonna set it up, he's just doing... No, it's gonna get reversed again.
[33:10.43]Reversed again.
[33:11.75]Doesn't want the ladder, does want the ladder.
[33:14.13]Who knows what the fuck they're doing.
[33:18.81]Just a little tap to make sure that you wouldn't get again.
[33:34.16]What was that?
[33:36.28]Wally Wheaton now sees an opportunity after FruFru just broke Garrett's back with his knees.
[33:43.60]Is this ever gonna end?
[33:45.04]Is there ever gonna be an opportunity for one of these psychos to put this shit up and go grab that money?
[33:50.84]Adam Sandler now in the ring for the first time in probably five minutes.
[33:53.72]Nice snap neck breaker there.
[33:57.95]Setting him up for it.
[33:59.41]Look at the exhaustion.
[34:00.25]Everybody's so tired.
[34:01.59]I don't think... No one's going to be able to climb to the top of this thing.
[34:06.16]Garrett's been really consistently the only one that's cared.
[34:11.36]And he currently still has the ladder.
[34:13.36]Adam Sandler.
[34:17.40]Adam Sandler's got Chuck Schuss.
[34:19.02]What a Chuck Schuss.
[34:29.78]He tried to do it again.
[34:31.00]He tried to do it to somebody else.
[34:35.06]He tried to do two in a row, but he couldn't get it.
[34:36.88]He missed with the other one.
[34:37.98]That's Garrett now.
[34:39.58]These two have done this over and over and over again.
[34:42.80]Back and forth, trading the ladder.
[34:46.21]What a somersault heel kick by Garrett.
[34:52.56]Garrett now, what a leg drop there.
[34:54.30]The ladder is finally set up and Garrett has a beautiful, sneaky opportunity here.
[34:58.86]Can he get the briefcase?
[34:59.88]He's got two of his hands on it.
[35:01.53]Can he unclip it?
[35:02.85]I think he might be able to get it.
[35:03.97]D56 now is barely, no, barely just stopping it.
[35:08.19]Is D56 going to be taking a capitalization here?
[35:11.97]This is it.
[35:13.46]This is gonna be it!
[35:15.06]D56 has almost got it!
[35:16.86]FruFru has seized an opportunity to push it over!
[35:20.81]Nooo!
[35:21.61]And she's still holding on!
[35:26.77]That's gotta be it.
[35:28.15]That's gotta be it.
[35:30.60]That's it.
[35:31.42]FruFru just has to climb up and grab it.
[35:34.52]He is completely, he's got a free, no traffic, no lane.
[35:39.38]Uh-oh, Chuck is seeing, they're both seeing it now.
[35:43.00]But was it too late?
[35:43.80]They were too busy fighting each other.
[35:45.04]What is Wally Wheat doing?
[35:47.64]Why would you do that?
[35:48.41]Why would you, what?
[35:49.51]She can't push it.
[35:50.57]No, he wins.
[35:54.49]She couldn't push it.
[35:56.01]She didn't, she ran out of strength.
[35:59.67]Fru Fru is your winner of The Sims Murder House ladder match.
[36:05.47]The fucking worst character just won.
[36:14.33]Why would you put that?
[36:15.85]Of all the things.
[36:20.18]Guys, don't worry.
[36:20.88]There's fucking snakes in there.
[36:23.38]He's gonna open that and his life is gonna end.
[36:25.58]So... Don't worry.
[36:30.40]Wally fucked it up.
[36:31.18]No, he just ran out of gas.
[36:34.89]D56 got up, trying to push the ladder over and just didn't have enough strength.
[36:48.16]The Sandler chokeslam.
[36:51.34]Ugh, that's fucking great.
[36:57.40]Can I edit people's chances to win a match?
[36:59.67]I think I can, but no, I don't.
[37:02.05]They gotta earn it, man.
[37:04.11]I don't give... I don't hand anybody victories here.
[37:06.58]You gotta earn it.
[37:07.32]I'm not gonna predetermine who wins.
[37:10.60]It's a... Whoever wins, they get in there and they fucking fight.
[37:18.75]If you thought... Okay, if you guys thought I could rig these matches... Why the fuck would I have this guy win?
[37:25.09]Why the fuck would I do that?
[37:30.69]Hey, I got an idea.
[37:31.41]Let me have like the shittiest character win.
[37:35.67]We got a table match coming up here.
[37:37.91]This is a 2v2... 2v2 table match.
[37:43.53]Tag match.
[37:47.27]Oh, whoops, I forgot.
[37:47.97]I have to mute the audio.
[37:49.63]Sorry about that.
[37:55.50]We are going back to a different era here.
[37:59.98]On the channel.
[38:01.24]By era, I mean...
[38:04.11]Different console generation.
[38:07.61]Different console generation than you're used to.
[38:21.51]Oh, fuck.
[38:25.58]Some could say that we are going back a few generations.
[38:30.52]Some could say.
[38:33.85]Let's go and get it started.
[38:36.85]2v2, table match.
[38:43.37]Let's see who it is.
[38:46.87]Hailing all the way from Monster Rancher.
[38:50.39]That's right, ladies and gentlemen, that's Beanbag Sonic!
[38:53.91]Are we gonna get to see it?
[38:54.98]Are we gonna get to see it?
[38:55.70]There it is!
[38:57.84]Beanbag Sonic making his first appearance ever.
[39:01.44]In the Rumble.
[39:06.89]Top seed Yep And BeamBagSonic's partner BeamBagSonic's partner Looking to see another dab Oh nice, that was a nice move
[39:35.83]Is it the mosquito?
[39:36.74]It's not the mosquito.
[39:38.66]It's somebody else.
[39:42.68]Somebody equally as important in the Monster Rancher streams and the PlayStation 1 streams in general.
[39:49.43]Beanbag Sonic's partner for the table match is... SweetRind.
[40:11.64]Rewind to the Rhine.
[40:12.88]Ladies and gentlemen, there is Sweet Rhine.
[40:14.40]Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Rhine.
[40:21.55]He is fucking huge.
[40:29.73]Well, they're very large.
[40:31.87]They're monsters.
[40:32.63]He's a giant wall.
[40:33.41]What do you expect?
[40:34.23]And they're opponents!
[40:36.00]From Point Blank!
[40:38.88]That's Dr. Don!
[40:42.76]Can you guess who his teammate will be?
[40:52.40]Who?
[40:53.18]That's Dr. Don from Point Blank.
[40:55.02]You guys don't know who this is?
[41:04.01]Well, then you're not going to know his partner, Dr. Dan.
[41:12.16]Wait, did nobody watch those streams?
[41:13.98]I streamed that like four times.
[41:23.55]No, wait, no.
[41:24.31]Yeah, you did.
[41:25.03]Yeah, you guys were there for those streams.
[41:35.85]Did those streams have low viewers?
[41:37.23]Well, some of you guys know who Dr. Don and Dr. Dan is.
[41:47.95]It's not a clone.
[41:48.89]That's not a clone.
[41:49.65]That's a different person.
[41:54.72]It's not a copy and paste.
[41:56.26]Go look him up.
[41:56.96]Dr. Don and Dr. Dan.
[42:04.45]I hope they fucking win.
[42:06.87]I hope they fucking win.
[42:08.63]I hope they destroy these two.
[42:21.70]Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ryan versus Dr. Don and Dr. Dan's PlayStation 1 battle.
[42:26.08]And it is a table match.
[42:37.05]Dr. Don is getting a table immediately.
[42:39.45]And Sweet Ryan has got a table.
[42:41.55]The match has just begun.
[42:42.75]Beanbag Sonic.
[42:45.09]Two tables are inside of the ring right now.
[42:47.29]Sweet Ryan is huge.
[42:49.52]SweetRide is too big.
[42:51.36]How do I edit this in the middle of the stream and make him like 30% smaller?
[42:55.55]Dr. Don with a nice spinning heel kick!
[43:01.21]Beanbag Sonic using his upper body strength on Dr. Dan.
[43:05.39]I may have mixed the two of them up.
[43:07.02]No clones, by the way.
[43:08.22]Ooh, what a delicious right-handed punch into the face of the- Well, does SweetRide have a face?
[43:16.74]I can't even tell.
[43:17.54]I don't know.
[43:18.00]Does SweetRide have a head?
[43:21.51]DDT, they're a big fan of that.
[43:22.87]Wait, now we got, hold on, there's a problem here though.
[43:25.58]Dr. Don and Dr. Dan are both in the ring.
[43:27.82]Beanbag Sonic is outside in pain.
[43:32.16]All it takes is one of those tables to get set up and this could be over.
[43:37.74]Yeah, Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, they're not clones.
[43:39.62]Dr. Dan has three inches of reach, a larger head.
[43:43.86]Ooh, right under the table, which is probably a better surface to land on.
[43:49.09]Are we gonna see the Sweet Rhine special move?
[43:50.73]I'm not sure.
[43:51.29]I did make sure to put it in.
[43:53.57]I wonder if we'll see it.
[43:54.48]Alright, I can't tell who did the move there.
[43:59.28]What a jumping scissor kick to Beanbag Sonic's stomach.
[44:05.86]Everybody talked all this shit about Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, but they are some of the top competitors we've seen in probably three years.
[44:15.32]They weren't allowed to bring their guns.
[44:16.62]He accidentally just hurt his partner there.
[44:19.45]I don't know how.
[44:22.31]I would say at this point it's a 70-30.
[44:25.09]With Dr. Don and Dr. Dan.
[44:26.61]Dr. Don, you just fucked up.
[44:29.67]What?
[44:30.27]You blew everything.
[44:31.42]You absolutely blew it.
[44:32.32]Sweet Ryan, that's like a 4,000 pound hunk of concrete on the top rope right now.
[44:36.84]Waiting for Dr. Don to get up.
[44:39.02]While Dr. Dan has Beam Bag Sonic up in a fireman's carry.
[44:42.44]Beautifully executed.
[44:43.65]While still waiting...
[44:47.56]Didn't even affect him!
[44:50.26]He just got him with the tip of his toes.
[44:52.38]He just scratched under his mustache with that kick.
[44:55.32]He waited so long to time that, too, but they're not known for their agility.
[44:59.24]Wall-type Monster Rancher monsters are very... They're known for strength, not for finesse.
[45:06.70]Just going onto the back of Sweetrine.
[45:11.12]Dr. Dan now.
[45:13.92]Sorry, there is a blockage in the way.
[45:15.76]I don't know what happened.
[45:18.66]You have a giant person standing in front of the camera.
[45:21.08]Uh-oh.
[45:23.72]Has the momentum shifted here with Beanbag Sonic and Dr. Don and Dr. Dan?
[45:28.75]No!
[45:29.25]Just when you thought it could have changed.
[45:32.15]The reversals here.
[45:33.13]Seems to be the reversal king is Dr. Don.
[45:36.21]I probably said their names backwards five times.
[45:40.52]He just dropped them on his head.
[45:42.70]He just picked them up and just dropped them on his head.
[45:45.12]Beanbag Sonic...
[45:47.88]Just absolutely, oh, he was going for a dab there.
[45:50.76]Never taunt in the middle of a match.
[45:52.14]He was going for a dab and he got caught by Dr. Dan.
[45:54.84]Dr. Dan now double teaming Sonic.
[46:00.04]Caught him right in the back.
[46:02.10]Ooh!
[46:05.67]I'm not sure Dr. Dan's getting up from that one.
[46:10.57]Throwing the table outside for some strange reason.
[46:13.37]Sweet right now.
[46:16.01]I have really no idea what they're doing.
[46:18.82]It's the first person to go through a table that their team loses.
[46:23.23]He's wrapping up both of his arms now.
[46:24.77]Throwing it behind a Jerma suplex with his arms tied behind his back.
[46:30.49]The AI is... His AI is really dumb.
[46:33.31]He's desperately trying to figure out how to pick up the table.
[46:36.94]He got confused there.
[46:38.44]They must... What the hell was that?
[46:41.90]No, don't, don't, don't set it up and then get thrown through it, beanbag.
[46:45.46]This could be it.
[46:47.38]He doesn't move through this table.
[46:48.46]This is it.
[46:48.88]It's game over.
[46:49.95]Beam back Sonic.
[46:51.21]This is it.
[46:52.39]That's it.
[46:55.09]Powerbomb through the table.
[46:57.01]Beam back Sonic and Sweet Rider, you're winners.
[47:05.00]Unbelievable super kick.
[47:06.42]That was intense.
[47:07.20]That's what set it all up.
[47:13.06]And here's the finisher here.
[47:14.16]He just throws him through the table into the corner.
[47:20.44]I think he may have gotten injured there himself.
[47:23.28]It's alright.
[47:24.36]We're going to give you meat tonight.
[47:26.16]Well, I'll give a potato to Sweet Rind.
[47:28.55]But... He's getting meat and he's getting candy.
[47:32.79]There they are.
[47:34.21]Two best friends.
[47:36.49]From one of the best PlayStation 1 games ever.
[47:42.07]Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, thank you for participating.
[47:45.95]But it's time for you to go home.
[47:47.65]Because you two are not in Rumbles.
[47:50.82]So, go home.
[47:52.68]That was a fucking bismal.
[48:00.08]You just got shit-canned on the air.
[48:08.43]But, anyways, beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ron to the winners.
[48:11.97]Getting ever so closer to the main event here.
[48:19.90]How many matches did I miss?
[48:22.30]Uh, this is the third one.
[48:25.08]Or is it another way?
[48:25.64]This is, yeah.
[48:27.22]So you got, you got two more.
[48:29.32]You got the next match, and then you got the Rumble.
[48:31.26]Rumble's gonna be like, probably 30 or 40 minutes.
[48:35.59]Three fixed matches?
[48:36.89]I didn't fix anything!
[48:38.75]I wanted Dr. Don and Dr. Dan to win.
[48:40.57]Alright, let's go with the next one.
[48:48.60]What was the first one?
[48:49.60]The first one was me versus Pinwheel.
[48:53.16]And I made it look really easy.
[48:56.48]Second match was a six-man ladder between The Sims Murder House.
[49:00.90]Dr. Don and Dr. Dan versus Sweet Ryan and Bean by Exonic.
[49:03.96]And then you got this one.
[49:04.72]A backstage brawl.
[49:08.42]Oh.
[49:09.28]No, okay.
[49:09.96]I know what this is.
[49:12.33]They make a lot of money.
[49:13.57]So I kind of let them use the space here at the Jerma Arena.
[49:18.74]So, it's okay though.
[49:20.32]I don't think this will take very long, so.
[49:24.72]Yeah, this won't take very long.
[49:30.96]Yeah, they're filming a YouTube video.
[49:34.43]Oh, that's Gary the Fuck Up and Bill Crazy.
[49:36.21]I let them... Were they supposed to come out... Yeah, they're making like a hardcore, like, we're fucked up YouTube video.
[49:44.79]Okay.
[49:48.74]So that's Gary the Fuckup.
[49:49.50]That's the cameraman.
[49:50.30]I'm not sure what they're doing back here though.
[49:51.66]I'd let them use the space.
[49:56.39]They make like 30 million dollars a year, guys.
[49:58.17]They're one of the most subscribed YouTube channels.
[50:03.92]It's something I heard.
[50:04.46]I've been wondering about the feet there.
[50:07.79]uh apparently for a top youtube dares thing that he did a long time ago he had his feet severed and had bird feet put on surgically so I I guess that he he's kind of up he's kind of up guy watch out for the camera though so they're filming oh that look that might look nice on the uh on the youtube channel
[50:37.17]Ooh, that was insane.
[50:38.57]Wow.
[50:40.25]He just jumped into the wall.
[50:44.78]Smashing his face on the ground.
[50:46.06]These guys are fucked.
[50:49.72]What else are they going to do for the video?
[50:51.40]Ooh, right into the... His head just hit the top of that amp there.
[50:55.20]What are they going to do again?
[51:01.19]No.
[51:01.31]Okay, I took like a $60,000 or $70,000 commission for this.
[51:04.97]Into the wall.
[51:05.63]Cool.
[51:14.15]No, this is just what they do.
[51:16.79]They jump into pools with fucking... Like, blood pools.
[51:23.13]They shoot baseballs at each other out of a pitching machine.
[51:26.29]I think number three or four most subscribed, like I said.
[51:34.13]I'm not sure, like, how this is gonna...
[51:37.16]Oh, they fucked that one up.
[51:39.00]They'll take care of that in editing.
[51:44.29]They'll edit that one out.
[51:52.31]Oh, he's setting up the shot.
[51:54.01]He's setting up a really good camera angle here.
[51:56.60]Oh, right in the balls!
[51:59.14]Dude, they just got a ball shot.
[52:00.88]I can't wait to see that in a compilation.
[52:12.67]Kicking dirt on him Oh no!
[52:32.27]That might be the last video he's ever made
[52:42.37]You can't just, like, st- stomp on somebody's head.
[52:49.77]He survived way worse.
[52:51.93]That's it?
[52:53.92]You've been, like- You've jumped off a building before, man!
[52:57.28]You've been electrocuted!
[52:58.50]You get, like, your head stepped on and you die?
[53:00.64]Ugh.
[53:12.93]I almost want to do it again.
[53:14.21]Because that's so... There's so many ways for them to do fucked up shit back here.
[53:21.23]They can... I may... I checked a bunch of boxes.
[53:24.01]For them to like fucking like kill each other back here.
[53:26.39]And you step on his head and that's it?
[53:27.81]He's dead?
[53:33.17]No, I can't I can't I can't do it I can't do a rematch that ends this whole thing But I kind of can't do a rematch you know what I mean We can do a rematch after we'll do like an encore presentation Alright
[54:01.86]That concludes that.
[54:03.34]Hopefully that upload is good and it gets 50 million views and they sell all their merch.
[54:10.06]This is the main event here.
[54:12.84]Here comes... Okay, I muted it.
[54:18.87]I almost broke something.
[54:19.89]Hold on, I freaked out.
[54:22.92]So, uh, something that you need to know is just because you were in the pre-matches does not mean you are in the Rumble.
[54:37.03]I had to make room for a lot of fucking people, so.
[54:46.37]There are a lot more characters that you have not seen.
[54:53.00]I can't get over that.
[54:54.18]I was thinking they were going to throw him through a TV.
[54:55.94]I can't.
[55:00.48]I can't.
[55:00.86]I got to, like, compose myself here.
[55:05.87]Alright.
[55:06.65]I'm ready.
[55:10.67]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event.
[55:11.91]This is the Jerma Rumble 2018.
[55:13.24]I hope you enjoy it.
[55:17.12]Let's get it started.
[55:23.53]You know the rules.
[55:25.63]Every minute or so, another contestant's going to come out to the ring.
[55:30.98]There is no commentary, so you cannot hear what this person is saying.
[55:37.50]The first 10 usually have an incredibly, incredibly high disadvantage.
[55:42.56]But it is very possible.
[55:44.70]Welcome to the Jerma Rumble 2018.
[55:49.35]Stream edition.
[55:50.79]They're all stream editions at this point.
[55:54.52]Over the top ropes, you're out.
[55:55.76]That's the only way.
[55:58.04]That is the only way.
[56:02.55]30 contestants.
[56:03.91]30.
[56:06.37]That's right.
[56:09.63]30.
[56:11.89]Mic muted.
[56:12.65]Well, her mic is muted.
[56:13.71]That's fine.
[56:14.27]Mine's not.
[56:14.83]Mine's open.
[56:18.11]I wonder who the first contestant is.
[56:19.15]It's all random.
[56:20.65]It's completely randomized, so I have no idea.
[56:23.91]I'm watching this at the same time as you guys.
[56:27.27]The first contestant coming out.
[56:29.77]Why is there music?
[56:32.65]Why is there music for Jex?
[56:35.71]There shouldn't be any music, but there's Jex, the first contestant.
[56:43.64]Making his first ever appearance.
[56:45.72]One of the most highly skilled video game players to ever live.
[56:55.22]There he is.
[56:55.64]He's got... Oh, he had an embroidery down, I see.
[57:01.97]That's a pretty nice embroidery.
[57:05.35]I will say, it looks pretty nice.
[57:08.65]Can we see some Jex's in the chat?
[57:10.29]I would like to see, maybe.
[57:11.53]We already see them.
[57:13.66]He's at a severe disadvantage, though.
[57:15.72]Because Jex is number one, which is nearly impossible.
[57:24.81]Maybe he'll go all the way.
[57:26.93]We've seen stranger things, for sure.
[57:33.64]Tag me in.
[57:35.28]No, that's not going to happen.
[57:36.30]Contestant number two.
[57:38.38]The first two.
[57:40.38]Who is number two?
[57:43.56]I'm excited.
[57:44.22]I'm ready.
[57:45.80]That's SweetRind.
[57:47.12]SweetRind is contestant number two.
[57:49.83]Just coming off of a victory with Beanbag Sonic.
[57:54.98]Sweet Ryan and Jex are the first two.
[58:01.34]I wonder how long it's gonna take.
[58:06.72]David and Goliath.
[58:09.64]Well, this is Jex we're talking about.
[58:11.94]This ain't just some shitty regular Jerma.
[58:15.16]You know?
[58:16.26]This is my alternate personality.
[58:18.04]JEX!
[58:19.14]2018 Jermania Jerma Rumble has started!
[58:23.14]Ooh, game almost crashed at the very beginning.
[58:25.30]That would have been real bad.
[58:28.48]But we got Jex and SweetRind in at the very beginning here.
[58:32.10]Trying to get us up the leg there.
[58:34.04]Nice.
[58:34.94]Throwing them backwards.
[58:37.02]And we already have another contestant coming in here.
[58:40.36]Already.
[58:40.85]It hadn't even been 20 seconds.
[58:43.55]Contestant number three coming in as Jex does a patented Jerma move.
[58:47.51]Garrett's coming in next.
[58:49.75]From The Sims Murder House.
[58:52.77]As contestant number three.
[58:53.91]There he is.
[58:58.23]Making his way.
[58:58.81]Ooh, nice fireman's carry.
[59:00.09]Tossing him over the shoulder there.
[59:02.47]Blocks that punch.
[59:03.25]Jex is going to be in it.
[59:04.44]I would triple or quadruple or septuple team Jex.
[59:08.44]He has the highest stats in the whole game.
[59:10.86]He's literally unbeatable.
[59:13.22]He is 100% unbeatable.
[59:16.16]I'd like to see what they do here.
[59:19.11]As Garrett is just taunting the crowd, here comes contestant number four.
[59:23.77]It's Pinwheel!
[59:26.18]Pinwheel with a small eye.
[59:28.16]He just picked him up and made him do a leg drop onto Sweet Ryan's head.
[59:36.32]That was a tag team effort there.
[59:38.80]That was not somebody doing a move.
[59:40.26]That was an actual double team on Sweet Ryan.
[59:43.97]So you got Jex, Pinwheel, Garrett, and Sweetrine in the ring right now.
[59:47.65]And Sweetrine is going to try to eliminate the competition here.
[59:50.19]Can Sweetrine get rid of Jex?
[59:52.20]Is Jex going to go out first ever?
[59:54.52]No, that can't be.
[59:55.32]It's impossible.
[59:56.22]It's impossible.
[59:56.80]It's impossible.
[59:57.54]I told you.
[59:59.46]Here comes contestant number five, Lou.
[60:02.30]Oh, of course.
[60:03.06]I know who Lou is.
[60:05.73]That's Lou Elbertson from the Elbertson family.
[60:11.83]Jeremy's Uncle Lou.
[60:15.15]Jex and Uncle Lou, both incredibly powerful.
[60:19.27]He was so excited to come here.
[60:20.69]He was so excited he was gonna make his first appearance.
[60:23.47]And he's gonna eliminate Pinwheel for Jeremy!
[60:26.80]Because he knows he hates his fucking character and he hates all the chat memes.
[60:30.60]No, he's not strong enough and without even thinking, Sweet Ryan has been eliminated.
[60:36.04]And now we've got Jex giving a powerbomb and here comes Glue Man!
[60:41.38]Glue Man making his appearance.
[60:45.01]Jax seems to, for some reason, have powerbombed Uncle Lou.
[60:48.88]And he's... Glue Man is going to go right for Jax.
[60:52.36]He is certain that if he wants to win this Rumble for the first time ever, he's been a part of every single Rumble.
[60:58.20]He has to take out the strongest competitor, but it's going to be very difficult for Glue Man.
[61:05.18]We've got a very, very full ring here.
[61:07.40]Sweet Rhyme first to be eliminated.
[61:10.04]Jax with a jumping dropkick on Blue Man.
[61:12.88]This is going to be a tough one.
[61:14.32]And Dr. Schmeichsen.
[61:16.33]The lie detector doctor.
[61:18.79]Making his first ever appearance as well.
[61:20.79]A lot of first timers here.
[61:22.33]Dr. Schmeichsen.
[61:24.47]Trying to go for a diving facebutt.
[61:27.79]But he did not make it.
[61:28.62]Garrett now is going to get over the top ropes.
[61:30.02]Is it possible they're going to double team Garrett here?
[61:31.70]Lou and Pinwheel.
[61:32.44]There he goes.
[61:34.00]Garrett has been eliminated by Uncle Lou and Pinwheel.
[61:41.72]Dr. Schmoykzen, Blue, Jex, Blue Man and Pinwheel.
[61:46.61]Here comes another contestant.
[61:49.05]I'm hearing a lot of boos.
[61:51.55]Oh, is that Bill?
[61:53.83]Oh, did he get up?
[61:54.77]Did he actually get up?
[61:57.99]It's Bill Crazy!
[61:59.63]He's actually not dead.
[62:01.80]Dr. Schmoykzen is about to eliminate Jex.
[62:05.16]No, it's impossible.
[62:07.12]It's literally not even possible.
[62:09.70]Good luck.
[62:11.43]He's the most undisputed video game champion to ever live.
[62:14.81]Billcrazy now has Uncle Lou in a POWERBOMB!
[62:17.95]Is he gonna- Jax did not like that.
[62:22.16]His Uncle Lou has been eliminated.
[62:26.96]Oh my god.
[62:28.00]Is he gonna do- Majestek from- He's naked.
[62:37.03]He's naked.
[62:38.73]MagicStank from Oblivion is going to get instantly eliminated.
[62:42.47]BillCrazy is gone.
[62:43.77]Lou is gone.
[62:44.53]Jex doing some fancy footwork taunting the crowd.
[62:47.65]He knows he is an undisputable champion.
[62:49.53]He'll never be beaten.
[62:51.74]Nice right hand on the MagicStank.
[62:54.80]Or the Flew for those of you that are keeping track.
[62:56.92]Pinwheel now two weird characters from very different games.
[63:00.66]Is it possible?
[63:02.65]Will pinwheel be limited by?
[63:04.07]No, not by Majestank the Flew.
[63:06.11]Dr. Schmoiksen now, he's got a cure for the Flew.
[63:08.53]It's called two right hands and an elbow to the back of the skull.
[63:11.19]He's got a cure for the Flew.
[63:14.02]Ladies and gentlemen, coming in here next is the Car Valet from Sleeping Dogs.
[63:22.77]Somebody order a car?
[63:24.85]I think so.
[63:27.02]There he is!
[63:28.44]The Car Valet!
[63:30.04]Ooh, and immediately gets stopped by Glue Man.
[63:38.49]We got the Dr. Schmoyza now, who seemed to have... Oh no, whoa, is the Car Valet gonna actually eliminate Glue Man?
[63:46.17]This would be so sad!
[63:46.99]This would be so sad for Glue Man!
[63:48.51]He's tried so many times!
[63:50.23]He's tried... Jex is about to be eliminated by Pinwheel!
[63:52.65]Don't you fucking dare!
[63:54.35]No!
[63:55.68]Yes, it's impossible!
[63:58.78]Don't do it.
[63:59.78]Do not.
[64:00.18]Pinwheel, do not eliminate Jax.
[64:02.60]Please, God.
[64:04.40]Thank God.
[64:04.76]Here comes the green screen.
[64:07.70]Put whatever character you want here.
[64:09.10]This is the green screen from last weekend.
[64:10.80]If you want to put, like, Super Mario here.
[64:14.58]Or you want to put, I don't know, like, the fat guy.
[64:17.51]Or, like, Peter Griffin or something.
[64:19.23]He's there for you.
[64:20.01]He's marked.
[64:22.74]He's huge.
[64:23.20]Well, the green screen is huge.
[64:24.24]Dr. Swanson now going with a couple of kicks into Jex's face.
[64:29.22]There are so many people in this ring.
[64:31.84]It's actually getting ridiculous.
[64:36.91]What?
[64:38.43]Is that actually Sans from Undertale?
[64:42.45]That's Sans from Undertale.
[64:44.57]There he is.
[64:48.88]There are too many people in the ring.
[64:50.64]Sans making his first appearance in Gerber Rumble.
[64:55.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, and there are eight people in the ring.
[64:59.01]This glue man is going to get his elimination here on Dr. Spikeson.
[65:03.54]This is assault on another person.
[65:06.92]Ooh, but he reverses it.
[65:08.42]Green screen now.
[65:09.06]We got the car valets in a bad spot.
[65:12.44]Dr. Schmoiks are now trying to... Oh no!
[65:15.68]The green screen!
[65:16.94]The green screen almost just eliminated Sans!
[65:19.32]In what seems like three or four seconds.
[65:23.56]How do you fight a green screen?
[65:24.92]You just get tangled up in it.
[65:25.98]You can't even go near it.
[65:28.24]You're gonna cast shadows on it.
[65:29.52]People are gonna scream at you.
[65:31.08]Glue Man though trying again.
[65:33.44]Trying to do it!
[65:34.32]No!
[65:35.04]No eliminations!
[65:36.28]With eight people Glue Man reverses it now.
[65:38.32]Is he gonna push him out?
[65:39.98]There's a lot of possibilities here.
[65:42.90]Jex just eliminated the car valet.
[65:46.08]That's another elimination from Jex.
[65:49.90]He was the first one in.
[65:50.96]Will he be the last one in as well as to go after Pinwheel?
[65:54.76]Dump him out of here.
[65:57.50]Jex is unbeatable.
[66:00.18]And I mean that.
[66:01.20]I mean it.
[66:01.64]And he's not going to lose to Pinwheel.
[66:04.41]No, like old shit Jerma beat Pinwheel.
[66:07.31]Jex cannot lose to Pinwheel.
[66:09.49]That would... Don't do it.
[66:10.91]Please don't do it.
[66:12.19]Fight back, Jex!
[66:13.33]Do something!
[66:13.79]Jex the Groff!
[66:14.85]There we go.
[66:15.61]Thank God.
[66:18.49]The green screen now has got Dr. Schweixen while Sans is in the corner.
[66:23.84]Is he going to go for elimination?
[66:26.60]I wonder what character is about to eliminate Dr. Schweixen.
[66:30.22]He's got a chance!
[66:32.10]No!
[66:32.90]No, he's not gonna!
[66:33.83]Pfft!
[66:38.29]A shooting star press from MagicStank, and there goes Dr. Schmoykson.
[66:42.80]Dr. Schmoykson is gone.
[66:44.94]Pinwheel is just taunting.
[66:46.90]Pinwheel is taunting everybody.
[66:48.80]Sans did not like that.
[66:50.30]Sans is gonna come up with Pinwheel, now gets chopped to the face for his efforts.
[66:55.39]Here it comes.
[66:55.93]What is with the moves from MagicStank?
[67:00.27]Another competitor that seems like ages since we've seen somebody new.
[67:04.50]And it's Beanbag Sonic.
[67:06.78]Coming in somewhere about at the midway point.
[67:10.06]That's a pretty good place to be, being Vaxonic.
[67:12.73]Making his first ever appearance in the Rumble.
[67:15.41]What happened?
[67:16.53]Wait, wait, did Jax... Wait, hold on!
[67:19.13]Hey!
[67:21.45]No!
[67:22.83]Hold on, Jax... I didn't even see it.
[67:25.19]Who eliminated Jax and Gloomin?
[67:27.67]Those are the two favorites.
[67:29.11]They're not gonna win.
[67:30.33]Jax and Gloomin are both gone.
[67:34.53]Did the green screen eliminate Jex?
[67:37.32]No fucking way.
[67:40.24]God damn it.
[67:41.34]I was looking at like... I was looking at... Ugh.
[67:44.38]They're both doing the same animation.
[67:46.68]There it goes.
[67:48.04]Jex and Glue Man.
[67:49.21]Glue Man will never win.
[67:50.89]He's just never gonna win.
[67:53.23]Well, take your pick in here.
[67:54.31]I'm rooting for Beanbag Sonic.
[67:57.35]I think he deserves it.
[67:59.87]Yeah, Beanbag Sonic and Sans both equal weight here.
[68:04.79]Sonic is fresh.
[68:06.05]Beanbag Sonic is brand new, so no fatigue.
[68:09.84]While Sans... What does Sonic have in mind here?
[68:13.70]What's he doing?
[68:14.92]Beanbag Sonic... You hear that crowd scream?
[68:21.02]Is Beanbag Sonic going to go around and eliminate every person?
[68:25.91]That is elimination number one for Beanbag Sonic.
[68:29.61]Dropped him on his head.
[68:30.55]Here comes another contestant.
[68:34.01]All the way from the one stream that everybody hated.
[68:37.93]Soon to be on a Christmas special.
[68:39.98]That's BF Bugleberry.
[68:42.14]Resident Scary Storyteller.
[68:48.88]There goes Pinwheel.
[68:50.29]The green screen is too strong.
[68:51.99]The green screen is too strong.
[68:52.99]I don't know why it's this powerful.
[68:56.35]BF Bugleberry.
[68:57.79]Sans is gone.
[68:59.61]Green screen now looking like the person to beat here.
[69:05.73]Sans is still outside.
[69:08.23]Beanbag Sonic, the green screen.
[69:10.45]Willem Dafoe is number 15 at the halfway mark.
[69:12.67]We have made it to halfway through the 2018 Rumble.
[69:17.25]And there is Willem Dafoe.
[69:18.43]Something of a... Something about a scientist.
[69:21.95]There he is.
[69:23.39]Half of one of Jeremy's emotes.
[69:25.83]And please get rid of the fucking green screen.
[69:27.53]Do it, Dafoe.
[69:28.77]Channel the goblin.
[69:29.51]You can do it.
[69:30.59]Channel the green goblin.
[69:32.07]He's green.
[69:33.28]He didn't even want to do it.
[69:34.08]He didn't care.
[69:35.56]What?
[69:37.12]Why did you do that?
[69:39.52]Let the goblin take over.
[69:40.92]Don't just let him eliminate you.
[69:42.38]What are you doing?
[69:43.10]Oh, Bugleberry is gone.
[69:48.41]Bugleberry.
[69:49.71]I wanted him to win.
[69:50.55]Bugleberry's gone.
[69:51.43]Gets eliminated by Beanbag Sonic.
[69:52.71]And in comes Binary Man.
[69:53.91]0-1-1-0-1-10-0-0-2-2.
[69:54.23]From the detective stream.
[70:04.66]He's incredibly strong.
[70:06.56]No, he's not.
[70:07.84]Oh, no, he's not.
[70:08.64]Is Beamback Sonic about to... Yeah, BinaryMan011010011.
[70:17.01]Welcome to the Rumble.
[70:18.85]Nice cartwheel by the Green Goblin, a.k.a.
[70:21.15]Willem Dafoe.
[70:22.39]Just testing the mat, I guess.
[70:25.91]Beamback Sonic, it would be a shame if BinaryMan eliminated you.
[70:30.31]It's alright.
[70:31.61]Because I just heard something.
[70:34.13]I just heard... The green screen's about to come out.
[70:35.98]Green screen's coming out.
[70:36.62]Maybe.
[70:37.08]Wall Dad's coming in.
[70:39.50]No, it's... Oh, what a right hand by Wall Dad.
[70:43.80]I just heard a sledgehammer break over on the side of the wall there, and I heard it, but... What does he have for a t-shirt?
[70:50.57]What is that?
[70:51.91]Is it...
[70:53.24]Okay, he's wearing his son's Minecon shirt.
[70:56.74]Okay.
[70:57.82]That's fine.
[70:58.70]I mean, he has to find a way to put clothes on if he's hiding in the wall.
[71:03.59]Wall Dad from House Flipper.
[71:07.29]What's that smell?
[71:09.83]That smells delicious.
[71:10.65]That smells kind of like a Red Blend wine to me.
[71:14.53]Binary Man has been eliminated as Red Blend.
[71:17.10]The wine glass with the cork head comes in.
[71:22.15]Binary Man is gone.
[71:23.27]Beanbag Sonic is still in.
[71:24.55]Magistank is still in.
[71:25.51]Willem Dafoe is still in.
[71:26.39]Greenscreen!
[71:28.15]Sonic is about to get eliminated by the Red Blend.
[71:30.89]Oh, that would be unfortunate.
[71:35.05]That does taste great, though.
[71:37.69]Beanbag Sonic is on the ropes.
[71:40.06]No!
[71:40.60]Wall Dad misses a punch there from the Greenscreen!
[71:44.64]Oh, and here comes Adam Sandler!
[71:46.36]No!
[71:47.58]No!
[71:50.05]No!
[71:50.81]The green screen needs to be eliminated.
[71:52.83]Adam Sandler going right for the green screen using his comedic comedy technique.
[71:57.47]Will he eliminate the green screen?
[72:03.55]Pick him up.
[72:03.93]He's fired up after that loss.
[72:06.99]Adam Sand... And there goes the red blend.
[72:08.54]Beanbag Sonic has eliminated another contestant.
[72:12.12]Red blend is now gone.
[72:14.66]But... It is good.
[72:19.33]So you got Willem Dafoe, Beanbag Sonic, Greenscreen, Adam Sandler, and Magistank.
[72:22.81]Except maybe not for long.
[72:24.43]Big dropkick there by Willem Dafoe.
[72:27.44]Don't.
[72:27.96]The Greenscreen's about to eliminate another person.
[72:35.36]No!
[72:36.42]No!
[72:38.90]Somebody has to stop him.
[72:40.44]Somebody stop the Greenscreen before he eliminates like 50 people.
[72:43.52]Hopefully it'll be Elvis.
[72:45.12]Hopefully it'll be Elvis from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[72:50.42]Come on, get in there, Elvis!
[72:52.34]Jerma's move to Vegas has proved to be successful.
[72:56.56]Elvis, of course.
[72:57.92]And look at how many people it takes to try to get the green screen out.
[73:00.82]You need three.
[73:01.70]Elvis, get over.
[73:02.24]Don't touch Beanbag Sonic.
[73:04.35]Go after the green screen.
[73:05.51]He's unbeatable.
[73:06.91]He's the Jex of this competition.
[73:08.31]What are you thinking?
[73:10.07]Nice reverse.
[73:11.07]And there goes Beanbag Sonic.
[73:12.39]Elvis eliminated Beanbag Sonic.
[73:14.43]Sad day.
[73:15.89]But he may eliminate the green screen.
[73:18.35]That's unfortunate.
[73:20.70]Oh, fucking great.
[73:21.50]How did he get in here?
[73:24.26]Really?
[73:29.95]He fucking... He hacked my... He hacked my fucking game.
[73:32.29]Put himself in.
[73:32.91]The fucking loser.
[73:35.57]That's GrillmasterXBBQ.
[73:38.99]The guy that I made a video with or something.
[73:42.19]He's a really, like, streamer.
[73:43.80]He sucks.
[73:44.92]Oh.
[73:47.47]This is his, like, haha, ultimate, like, I got you, right?
[73:50.31]Like, you come in here at the Jerma Rumble, like, my fucking thing.
[73:54.76]I don't even know what he made of stats.
[73:58.78]But, that's fucking annoying.
[74:00.08]Anyways, GrillmasterXBBQ, an old cooking channel from YouTube, is going to be welcomed by GaryTheFuckUp.
[74:08.57]Maybe GaryTheFuckUp can get some more YouTube footage of him hurting people.
[74:14.17]As he's got Willem Dafoe over the shoulder here.
[74:16.17]No, gets reversed by Willem Dafoe.
[74:20.51]Elvis, Grillmaster.
[74:21.67]The green screen.
[74:23.25]Gary the fuck up.
[74:24.71]Magic Stank.
[74:26.61]And speaking of Grillmaster, is he going to eliminate Elvis?
[74:30.53]Elvis is not eliminated.
[74:32.77]He's still in the ring.
[74:33.83]And here comes Otto.
[74:35.96]Otto the Dachshund.
[74:38.10]It's taken me four or five years to put him in.
[74:40.86]But there he is.
[74:41.54]There's Otto.
[74:47.76]Hey, come on.
[74:48.52]At least let him get in the ring for a second.
[74:52.68]Gary the Fuckup is gone.
[74:54.08]Willem Dafoe with a lariat.
[74:56.28]An absolutely hellish lariat to Gary the Fuckup.
[75:00.61]Both the duo of Bill Crazy and Gary the Fuckup are gone.
[75:04.35]Otto comes in.
[75:05.07]The longest person that's been in here.
[75:06.83]The green screen has been in here the absolute longest.
[75:09.19]It's been almost 20 straight minutes.
[75:13.10]Oh, right.
[75:13.64]I forgot.
[75:14.70]There comes Jerma Raptor.
[75:20.96]Most embarrassing thing I've ever done.
[75:22.36]He's now in the ring.
[75:24.58]I feel like he deserved to be there.
[75:26.78]And I would make it... I would be so happy if you threw this guy out right now.
[75:30.81]I would be ecstatic if Jerma Raptor threw Grill Maxtor at XBBQ out right now.
[75:36.25]What are you doing?
[75:36.79]Are you using him as an exercise ball?
[75:38.29]Are you gonna let him do that to you?
[75:41.01]Really?
[75:42.45]Willem Dafoe taking a little bit of a break.
[75:45.77]as the green screen is just knows how strong he is and knows that no one stands a chance he just pushed dermaraptor and thank god thank you elvis elvis just eliminated grill master x barbecue to never return they'll never be in another rumble ever again I'm deleting the character why did he is he eliminating himself what the fuck was that what what did Otto just do or did Otto just fake him why did you remember raptor just jump over the ropes for no reason
[76:16.87]Well, it's okay.
[76:18.69]Jerma Raptor will get replaced by another Jerma character.
[76:21.36]Here comes Odd Michael.
[76:23.60]You can't put capes on in this game for some reason, but there's Odd Michael.
[76:28.61]This is going to get interesting.
[76:29.57]There goes Willem Dafoe.
[76:30.49]Magistang throws Willem Dafoe over the top ropes.
[76:32.45]You've got Elvis and Odd Michael in the same spot.
[76:36.29]Will they work together?
[76:40.33]I would love to see a Jerma, Odd Michael, and an Elvis collaboration here.
[76:46.35]Going after his own dog while the fucking green screen is about to throw another person over the top ropes.
[76:52.34]Thankfully Elvis ain't down with that.
[76:55.92]As he breaks out of what could have been a terrible situation for him.
[77:01.62]No, they're fighting each other.
[77:02.68]Don't fight each other.
[77:03.44]You should be helping each other.
[77:04.50]The three of you.
[77:06.16]Yes.
[77:06.72]Just get taunted by the green screen while he just does a boot party on Elvis.
[77:13.81]MagicStank is still something.
[77:15.51]Just like the ear clap.
[77:16.99]He just crushed us.
[77:17.91]He just gave him a migraine.
[77:19.35]Otto now has odd Michael while the green screen, thank God, has not eliminated a seventh person potentially.
[77:27.84]No, there it is.
[77:29.87]There goes Elvis by the green screen, but I have high hopes for the Nintendo Labo.
[77:37.05]I have extraordinarily high hopes.
[77:41.86]Taking a long time to get in here.
[77:42.94]There he is.
[77:44.58]The Nintendo Switch Labo.
[77:46.40]And he just goes right after Jerma for making such a terribly boring stream three times.
[77:51.56]Make sure you do it on the fold lines.
[77:53.78]Crease the fold lines well when you throw them out.
[77:56.39]Otherwise, what the fuck are you doing, Oddbiker?
[77:59.86]There was absolutely no reason to do that.
[78:05.43]This would be pretty poetic if Odd Michael were to be eliminated by the Labo.
[78:10.61]As the green screen is in a very bad position for the Quiet Man to come in.
[78:15.60]Quiet Man number 27.
[78:19.52]27 in comes the Quiet Man from literally the worst game ever.
[78:27.64]As he picks up Odd Michael over the shoulder.
[78:30.98]No, a reversal.
[78:35.10]The Quiet Man is one of the last three.
[78:37.03]Get him out of here.
[78:39.53]Get the green screen out of here.
[78:41.43]Of all the people.
[78:43.01]I can't fucking believe he's still in this.
[78:44.97]He's about to throw a magic snake over the top ropes.
[78:46.71]Is it going to be possible?
[78:47.59]There he goes.
[78:50.32]Chuck Schnoswell, number 28.
[78:53.36]Will somebody stop him?
[78:56.04]Somebody please.
[78:58.78]He's just... He's just the new Jex.
[79:03.66]Chuck Schnoswell.
[79:05.86]Coming in.
[79:06.33]Will he be the hero that we all hope for?
[79:09.27]Come on, Chuck.
[79:10.77]He feels the crowd.
[79:11.65]He feels the energy of the audience.
[79:13.49]Will Chuck Schnoswell eliminate the most impossible to eliminate contender?
[79:17.77]He's got him over the top, just barely pushing his legs.
[79:21.32]Come on, Chuck.
[79:22.72]Use the fucking nose.
[79:24.36]Use your nose, Chuck.
[79:26.74]Get it!
[79:27.84]Get it!
[79:28.96]No!
[79:31.64]Otto is about to throw on Michael over the top ropes.
[79:35.80]And here comes a hornet from the fucking wall of the old house.
[79:40.71]If there's anybody that can do it, it's definitely him.
[79:44.71]And the quiet man is about to throw.
[79:46.67]No, thank God it was just a scope slam.
[79:48.65]Chuck Stoswell now for that insolence.
[79:51.49]And that...
[80:00.53]No.
[80:02.23]No.
[80:07.17]Well, somebody sprayed the Hornet.
[80:10.19]He's gone.
[80:11.90]That was all it took.
[80:13.98]He just swatted him.
[80:14.92]What an overhead press by the client family.
[80:18.42]On to Otto the Dog.
[80:19.74]Odd Michael.
[80:21.30]Trying to put work into the green screen.
[80:23.98]Huge choke slam.
[80:25.44]And there goes Odd.
[80:26.70]No.
[80:27.24]There goes... Who the fuck was it?
[80:29.52]Who just got thrown out?
[80:31.58]Otto!
[80:31.98]Oh god, it's Otto the dog has been eliminated.
[80:36.02]By the quiet man.
[80:36.96]And the quiet man's about to powerbomb the Labo.
[80:41.27]He is incredibly strong.
[80:42.77]Greenscreen still cannot get thrown out after being double teamed.
[80:47.55]We only have two more people coming in.
[80:49.75]Nice miss, OddMichael.
[80:53.19]You're a shitty Doctor Strange.
[80:55.70]This boo's coming in.
[80:58.94]Could this be?
[81:00.56]Can we get the last person?
[81:02.66]The last person is Fireman!
[81:06.82]What the?
[81:07.40]What is he?
[81:08.16]Holy shit!
[81:13.15]He's fresh and he's the last contestant.
[81:16.45]Get rid of that fucking green screen!
[81:19.71]The green screen is dazed.
[81:21.05]He's tired.
[81:21.87]He's confused.
[81:23.23]Fireman!
[81:24.67]Oh!
[81:26.00]No, just barely.
[81:27.76]You didn't do it.
[81:28.68]I think he's so stupid.
[81:29.54]He thinks he did it.
[81:31.58]He thought he eliminated him.
[81:32.74]He couldn't tell.
[81:33.22]He was invisible.
[81:34.10]Somebody keyed him out.
[81:35.39]Somebody keyed the green screen out.
[81:37.69]No.
[81:38.07]There goes Odd Michael.
[81:39.81]Whoa.
[81:42.61]Fireman fighting for his life.
[81:44.85]The green screen just can't seem to do it.
[81:47.07]One of these contestants will win.
[81:49.43]One of these contestants will win.
[81:51.25]The Labo has just been limited by Chuck Schnozwell.
[81:53.47]Fireman, green screen, and the Quiet Man.
[81:55.71]One of these four will be your 2018 champion.
[82:01.19]It's just absolute bullshit that he can just be keyed out whenever he wants.
[82:06.42]He can turn invisible.
[82:07.26]He can turn into other people.
[82:08.12]He can turn into you, and you think you're in the ring.
[82:11.50]What a reversal by Fireman.
[82:14.51]Will Fireman come in as the last spot and clean up the whole ring?
[82:19.39]No, not quite.
[82:20.37]Quiet man.
[82:21.05]Gets dropped on the knee there.
[82:25.72]What is he pointing to?
[82:27.69]I think he's just trying to get some energy here.
[82:29.97]Chuck Schnoswell doing a dab from one of his best friends, Beanbag Sonic.
[82:33.61]They've become really close friends, actually, since those videos.
[82:36.59]And can Chuck Schnoswell, with the strength of 50... No!
[82:41.44]No.
[82:41.98]With the strength of 50 bats, be able to throw him over.
[82:47.94]Uh-oh.
[82:48.38]Quiet man with a big right hand.
[82:51.76]We've got to see an elimination here.
[82:53.40]We've got to see a green screen quiet man elimination.
[82:56.16]Chuck Schnoswell with a huge suplex.
[83:00.25]You've got two fan favorites.
[83:03.45]A character that I put in because of a stream I did three days ago.
[83:08.62]And the green screen.
[83:10.80]Who is going to win?
[83:12.97]Chuck Schnoswell now in the air.
[83:14.25]The green screen.
[83:16.15]Just seems to pick up all these characters like toys.
[83:19.95]As Fireman is going to see an opportunity to pick up the Quiet Man and maybe get something done here.
[83:26.00]Scooping him up over the shoulder.
[83:28.08]Throwing him backwards into the ground.
[83:30.88]Ooh, knees to the face.
[83:33.32]That's got to hurt though.
[83:33.98]He might get burnt.
[83:35.85]The top of the head of Fireman is very, very strong now.
[83:39.39]And I don't know what he's doing here.
[83:41.64]He's trying to break his leg.
[83:43.08]As the green screen gets reversed by Fireman.
[83:48.90]Not in a good position.
[83:49.80]Quiet Man has Chuck on the... This is not good for Chuck.
[83:54.31]Quiet Man could see an elimination here and would be down to three.
[83:58.38]Fireman is awaiting the consciousness.
[84:02.36]Do it.
[84:03.12]Come on, Fireman.
[84:05.28]Oh, no.
[84:06.04]He gets stopped by a stray punch by Chuck Schnoswell.
[84:14.13]I will say, though, these four, they're giving it all they got.
[84:19.07]Chuck is just getting punched after punched in the face over and over again.
[84:24.47]Thank God he's got that nose armor.
[84:27.40]And now Chuck is in the grasp of the green screen.
[84:32.18]No man, no thing, no person has been able to stop him.
[84:39.11]As you see, the quiet man.
[84:41.87]Chuck Schnoswell is gone.
[84:42.89]It's quiet man.
[84:44.17]No!
[84:45.27]Thank goodness.
[84:46.97]Come on, fireman.
[84:48.37]Fireman, stop it.
[84:49.67]Fireman, no.
[84:51.48]No, fireman.
[84:52.34]Do what you can.
[84:52.92]No!
[84:54.98]Oh no!
[84:55.64]It's... It's the green screen versus quiet man How many eliminations has the green screen done?
[85:10.01]This is like 12 eliminations Is he gonna throw him over the ropes right now?
[85:21.92]There's no way.
[85:23.36]I can't, I would be so shocked.
[85:26.61]If the Quiet Man eliminates the green screen.
[85:30.73]Oh, that's it.
[85:32.25]That's gonna be it!
[85:33.09]That's it!
[85:34.25]The winner of the 2018 Rumble is the green screen.
[85:39.43]I can't believe it.
[85:41.83]He destroyed everybody.
[85:42.99]It wasn't even a chance.
[85:43.95]Nobody had a chance.
[85:50.12]Nobody could even match his strength.
[86:02.46]The green screen.
[86:06.76]There you go.
[86:10.16]Yep.
[86:12.06]See ya, WrestleMania.
[86:13.11]This is WrestleMania.
[86:17.20]He lasted a very, very long time too.
[86:19.38]That was so long.
[86:22.77]He was like number what?
[86:23.57]Like 11 or 12 or something?
[86:24.49]He stayed in the whole time.
[86:25.65]Holy shit.
[86:35.54]But it could be anybody.
[86:37.24]This could be anybody.
[86:45.58]Correct the timeline.
[86:47.04]I can't that is the timeline Fucking green screen God damn it Alright, well I if I rematch it's not gonna randomize them again I'm gonna have to just do another one
[87:18.45]The green screen winning is worse than the pencil.
[87:21.29]I don't think that's true.
[87:22.15]Alright, well, I'll do another one for fun.
[87:26.88]We'll do the encore here.
[87:29.50]Congratulations to the 2018 Jermania Rumble for the green screen.
[87:35.91]At least it wasn't the Quiet Man.
[87:38.57]Oh, thank God.
[87:42.31]There's nothing... I would have been so upset.
[87:49.04]Alright, let me, uh... Let's just do another rumble.
[87:57.05]So, this next one is not canon, but it's just for fun.
[87:59.17]I guess we could throw... How about this?
[88:08.15]It's canon.
[88:08.79]No, that green screen wins.
[88:14.92]It's out of my hands.
[88:22.76]Alright, let me get this set up.
[88:25.20]Let's put the same people in at random.
[88:35.15]Show the stats of everybody?
[88:38.09]They're all very, very similar.
[88:40.71]I'll show you.
[88:41.15]Hold on.
[88:44.45]I think the green screen has...
[88:48.31]I don't think the green screen has that high of stats.
[88:50.43]Yeah, he doesn't.
[88:51.89]Lou has more stats than the green screen.
[88:54.09]Like, we'll just put it that way.
[88:55.73]Like, look.
[88:57.87]Lou is 100 overall.
[88:59.56]Green screen is 92.
[89:00.14]Like, you know what I mean?
[89:06.62]He's a fucking 100.
[89:11.40]But everybody... I never put anybody under, like, 85.
[89:15.16]Like, ever.
[89:16.48]Like, 90.
[89:19.88]Because it's more fun that way.
[89:21.50]Because if you have... It doesn't really matter as much.
[89:25.92]Oh, and it's 92.
[89:26.80]No, they're all like in the 80s and 90s.
[89:32.75]What does Sandler have?
[89:40.42]Never mind.
[89:40.96]That's not true.
[89:41.62]He's 79.
[89:42.22]Alright, but...
[89:54.03]Alright, let's get everybody in here.
[90:03.22]See, well, Binary Man's 80.
[90:04.84]Yeah, everybody's within like 80 to 100, 80 to 95.
[90:07.88]So then it's not like unfair for anybody.
[90:17.79]Fucking green screen.
[90:19.55]GaryTheFuckUps100.
[90:20.39]Yeah, I don't know why he's stronger than Bill.
[90:25.36]He should not be stronger than Bill Crazy, but he is apparently.
[90:34.10]Yeah, 94.
[90:37.09]Except for Sandler.
[90:38.43]You really want me to make Adam Sandler the strongest person?
[90:41.31]Alright, hold on.
[90:44.15]Let me get rid of you.
[90:45.43]Who's not in it?
[90:50.06]Wait, I don't think she was in it before.
[90:51.44]Oh, you can be in there this time.
[90:57.86]Binary Man.
[90:58.72]Binary Man was so bad.
[90:59.86]Did you even get to see his face?
[91:04.28]Look at his face.
[91:04.82]He's got like... You can only have eight numbers or letters on a character.
[91:12.37]green screens of weight and stats uh yeah but wouldn't that be the same thing with um like the labo and the the labo is the same stats he I know for I am certain that he is like a super heavyweight Bugleberry I made him like four or five hundred pounds
[91:39.24]Let's go here.
[91:40.14]But if you were just joining us for the festivities there, thank you for joining.
[91:45.34]There's a lot of people here.
[91:47.68]So, thanks a lot.
[91:50.19]Thanks for sticking around.
[91:51.91]Now we're going to do the encore.
[91:59.89]Here they all are.
[92:05.16]Carry the fuck up.
[92:09.07]Otto versus Jeremy.
[92:10.17]Yeah, but see how it's just random?
[92:12.80]Like, I can't... I don't... You can do it.
[92:16.12]See, entry order?
[92:16.82]I can do it.
[92:18.18]But that's not fun.
[92:20.06]I'd rather let the cards lie however they lie, you know?
[92:23.40]Okay.
[92:33.32]No.
[92:34.32]But look at these other wrestlers.
[92:35.33]Like, 73.
[92:35.55]70.
[92:35.57]Come on, man.
[92:45.81]Poor Blue Man.
[92:46.55]Blue Man's never gonna win.
[92:53.72]Green screen first.
[92:57.08]But you can't... We can't do that.
[92:58.64]I have to at least give the... It's not random at that point.
[93:08.77]Alright, we got Red Blend.
[93:10.33]Chris Jericho's not going to be in it.
[93:14.00]Uh, there's real fast.
[93:17.38]Sans, yeah.
[93:21.36]There was no BF.
[93:24.14]Do I deserve to- I didn't put myself in the rumble.
[93:26.38]I'm already there like three times.
[93:29.54]Do I deserve to be there this time?
[93:37.70]Alright.
[93:39.65]I guess I deserve to be there on the encore.
[93:44.39]It's not canon, so it's fine.
[93:45.50]No, these two, these two aren't being in it, Labo.
[93:52.80]I don't know who the hell you are, but you're not in it.
[93:56.02]Jax, I really thought he was gonna go far.
[93:58.36]Look at his stats, come on.
[94:00.56]Elvis is 88.
[94:01.64]Who eliminated Jax?
[94:05.77]Leave John Cena in.
[94:07.11]Alright, John Cena can replace Elvis.
[94:13.66]Who the hell is John Cena?
[94:21.53]That's so odd.
[94:22.83]Oh, Chad Gable.
[94:23.83]Chris Jericho.
[94:24.49]Oh, Curt Hawkins.
[94:25.37]Oh, okay.
[94:26.63]DDP.
[94:27.75]Nice.
[94:28.72]Oh, Dr. Dan and Dr. Don.
[94:30.64]You belong in this universe.
[94:37.66]Now, who the hell is he?
[94:42.27]Seth Rollins.
[94:47.86]Let's see.
[94:49.04]Where's John?
[94:50.66]Oh, this is Champions.
[94:51.60]Okay.
[94:56.36]Jim.
[94:57.04]John Cena.
[94:58.04]Why the fuck am I putting him in this?
[95:00.53]He's not even as strong as Jex.
[95:01.81]Why?
[95:02.39]You shouldn't even be here.
[95:03.07]Adam Sandler stays.
[95:03.99]Beagleberry stays.
[95:09.89]Alright.
[95:11.35]Poor Wall.
[95:17.98]How is Pinwheel 96?
[95:20.48]Because it wouldn't have been fair.
[95:23.85]If I made Pinwheel like 10 and me 90 or 80, that match would, you'd be able to say that's not fair.
[95:31.11]I beat him as a fucking 90 plus.
[95:35.98]Uh, Wally Wheat will have been foe.
[95:37.64]Pinwheel.
[95:40.38]Okay.
[95:41.86]Yeah, you're out of here.
[95:44.32]Never allowed in another Rumble ever again.
[95:46.60]Alright, so we put Sweet Ryan, Odd Michael, Magic Stank, or Fru Fru, or Elvis.
[95:55.37]Put Pinwheel at 10.
[95:56.33]Alright, Sweet Ryan.
[95:59.67]So yeah, the green screen's staying in.
[96:00.97]We can't, just because they're all powerful doesn't mean that they're impossible to overcome.
[96:09.53]Alright, looks good.
[96:16.01]uh yeah you can't do anything in a rumble momentum is normal entrances are fine uh we could do fast momentum I usually put it on normal fast alright let's do it alright let's go here's the encore rumble let's see what happens
[96:45.54]And then we'll do a hardcore cage match or something with random people.
[96:57.51]But that was a lot of fun.
[97:00.07]It always is.
[97:16.51]Alright, we already know how the rules work.
[97:18.41]Skip.
[97:19.39]Can I skip?
[97:22.78]Oh, yeah.
[97:23.00]I forgot John Cena is in the game.
[97:25.36]Well, look.
[97:25.64]I'm going to get another drink.
[97:30.02]We'll do another match or two.
[97:30.98]Don't worry.
[97:33.22]Alright, I'll be right back.
[97:33.96]I'm going to grab a drink.
[97:35.40]Just let this play out.
[97:36.44]I'm not even going to know who the first two are, so I'll be right back.
[97:45.35]Oh, somebody said no Avril Lavigne.
[97:46.81]I tried.
[97:48.41]The problem is you can't have... I'm pretty sure you can't have female and male wrestlers in the same ring at the same time.
[97:58.25]I'm fairly certain about that.
[98:01.49]Unless they changed it.
[98:02.89]But I don't think they did because I couldn't do it.
[98:05.61]So... Avril Lavigne was supposed to be in place of one of the...
[98:13.14]One of, like, the red blend.
[98:14.86]Like, the fucking wine.
[98:17.72]That was the last character, by the way.
[98:19.34]I just, like... Oh, shit.
[98:20.67]I gotta have, like, a 36th person.
[98:22.39]Oh, come on.
[98:23.07]I don't want to see this.
[98:24.49]I'll be right back.
[100:47.38]Alright, what'd I miss?
[100:50.26]Wait, is this... This entrance has been going on for so long.
[100:56.47]This is all you've been seeing.
[100:59.45]Alright, well here's the alternate timeline.
[101:11.07]Let's do it.
[101:13.11]Welcome to the Encore Rumble.
[101:14.47]BF Beelgeberry, my favorite character.
[101:17.75]It's probably gonna get eliminated in like 15 seconds.
[101:21.17]Here we go.
[101:23.87]And different camera angle for some reason.
[101:26.10]That was nice.
[101:27.92]Can we get more?
[101:28.84]Cannon match?
[101:30.36]No, this is the alternate fucking timeline.
[101:33.80]You know like Civil War or Marvel?
[101:36.38]How like, that happened in its own universe.
[101:42.33]Number three coming in is Bill Crazy.
[101:46.00]Why do they wipe the dirt?
[101:47.70]I don't understand.
[101:48.42]This is canon.
[101:52.12]This is not canon.
[101:55.26]It's not canon because Bugleberry is going to get eliminated first.
[101:59.24]And that just angers me.
[102:05.99]Billcrazy now has got Pinwheel.
[102:09.23]Hopefully, eliminating you first because you're the worst character.
[102:13.31]So please get rid of Pinwheel.
[102:16.33]Get rid of him.
[102:19.23]Yes!
[102:19.67]Thank God!
[102:22.11]And, hey, are you sure you guys want this cannon?
[102:23.93]Because Beanbag Sonic's coming in at number four.
[102:25.81]Are you sure you want this to be cannon?
[102:27.49]You sure?
[102:29.07]Or do you want to write your fanfiction where Beanbag Sonic wins and eliminates 29 people?
[102:33.45]What the fuck?
[102:37.33]No, no.
[102:37.97]This is my favorite character.
[102:39.59]Don't do it.
[102:40.63]Don't you fucking dare.
[102:44.26]Come on, BF Bugleberry.
[102:45.86]Pull a green screen.
[102:49.16]Yeah, by the way, I told you this already.
[102:50.64]You'll be seeing this guy real fucking soon on Christmas.
[102:53.92]Christmas spooktacular.
[102:55.02]Gonna be the scariest fucking Christmas screen you'll ever see.
[103:03.60]Ooh, what a beautiful move by BF Bugleberry.
[103:06.76]Quiet man coming in number five.
[103:09.63]Thank God.
[103:14.09]Why would you roll to the outside of the ring?
[103:15.39]What are you doing?
[103:16.95]Why would you ever do that?
[103:18.09]For what reason?
[103:20.37]Bill Crazy is still taking punches here from the Quiet Man.
[103:23.25]Going for his bird feet kick.
[103:26.21]The claws there is going to rip.
[103:28.60]I almost just said something really fucked up.
[103:30.92]Let's just pretend.
[103:31.54]Let's just say we kicked him.
[103:33.46]Dermaraptor coming in number six.
[103:37.32]That guy back there is really excited.
[103:39.58]In the white shirt.
[103:42.81]Trevor Raptor.
[103:45.04]Which, by the way, again, next weekend is the movie night for the green screen stuff.
[103:50.16]If you have a submission, please go check out the Discord and check out the rules associated with that.
[103:54.92]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[103:57.04]I've already seen a couple submissions and they are... What the fuck?
[104:00.21]That was crazy.
[104:02.23]This is now canon.
[104:03.61]Just because of that.
[104:04.21]Like, he's been practicing for his YouTube channel.
[104:10.41]Here comes Garrett.
[104:10.87]Garrett.
[104:12.32]From Sim's family house.
[104:14.64]I did that on the green screen.
[104:16.54]I did that six days ago.
[104:18.28]That exact move.
[104:21.28]Nice reversal there by Garrett.
[104:30.62]BFBugleberry is still in.
[104:31.94]There goes the Quiet Man.
[104:32.92]Thank God.
[104:35.50]If there was a straw poll right now, he would be... Yeah, there goes BVACSonic by BFBugleberry.
[104:41.64]If I did a poll right now, I think the Quiet Man would be number one.
[104:46.68]Okay, that... What the hell is that?
[104:49.67]A lot of weird shit in this one.
[104:51.85]The computer's trying to load a bunch of random things.
[104:56.01]We got two Sims murder house.
[104:58.81]Nice recover there by Chuck Schnoswell.
[105:00.59]I mean, they all hate each other, so it makes sense why they would be fighting each other anyways.
[105:05.42]Belly-to-belly suplex.
[105:08.86]No, he's just kind of hugging him really tightly.
[105:12.94]Not much he can do to Bill Crazy that he has not done to himself already.
[105:16.92]And JermaRaptor is about to learn the hard way here.
[105:19.24]He's going to get scooped out and possibly thrown over by Bill Crazy.
[105:23.04]Is it possible?
[105:23.70]Is he going to get it done?
[105:24.80]BF Bugleberry now coming in to aid Bill Crazy.
[105:28.07]And they get it done.
[105:28.87]JermaRaptor is gone.
[105:29.93]Bugleberry showing lots of strength here.
[105:35.27]He crossed arm.
[105:36.63]Check into Bill Crazy.
[105:38.18]After the help, I think it's time for me to fuck up your face.
[105:42.01]Car valet comes in.
[105:47.65]He's probably a little confused because this is the second time that somebody has called in the last 30 minutes.
[105:55.51]He keeps parking cars out there.
[105:56.89]By the way, his entrance is him riding it on a motorcycle and stopping.
[106:02.70]But, you know, you don't get to see that because this is the Rumble.
[106:06.90]And it didn't make it.
[106:08.38]Number 10 is Sans Undertale.
[106:13.58]You left after the last one?
[106:14.52]Yeah, we're just doing an encore one for fun.
[106:16.64]That is now officially canon because Bill Crazy did a backflip, so now it's canon.
[106:24.73]Saiyan's coming at number 10 and probably instantly eliminated by Bill Crazy.
[106:28.29]Taunting is a bad move here.
[106:29.92]Why would you do that?
[106:34.50]He did the Hulk Hogan and he kind of looks like Hulk Hogan.
[106:37.62]I didn't intend that to happen, but it just happened.
[106:44.22]Otto the Dog coming in at number 11.
[106:46.52]Bugleberry looks like he's in.
[106:48.10]No.
[106:48.20]Come on.
[106:50.64]Make this cannon.
[106:51.88]Big suplex to Garrett from the Car Valet from Sleeping Dogs.
[107:00.05]I thought that Phil Crazy was going over the top ropes there, but no.
[107:03.85]Big wow.
[107:04.73]Oh, big wow.
[107:06.49]Otto is gone.
[107:07.23]God damn it, man.
[107:08.20]Can he catch a break?
[107:11.08]Bugleberry is top seed right now.
[107:17.78]He... He didn't even get to take a second breath.
[107:22.31]He inhaled, walked into the ring, got eliminated and then exhaled.
[107:27.65]He didn't get to even breathe.
[107:30.29]Well, Otto the Dog is gone.
[107:31.35]Here comes Sweet Rind.
[107:36.64]Still getting close to the halfway point.
[107:40.32]On our Marvel Ultimate... Alternate Universe!
[107:46.11]Oh, there goes the car valet, Sweet Rind.
[107:48.41]With a big right-handed punch.
[107:49.59]Throws him over.
[107:50.19]He's gone.
[107:51.25]Sorry if you were betting on him.
[107:56.99]That was just wild.
[107:58.25]Just swinging in every direction was Bill Crazy.
[108:00.95]He didn't even care.
[108:01.63]He was just going to hurt anybody that was near him.
[108:04.27]Powerbomb.
[108:07.15]Potentially over the top ropes to Sweet Rind from Bill Crazy.
[108:10.07]Are we going to see it?
[108:10.93]Holy shit.
[108:12.27]That happened twice.
[108:13.38]They both did it.
[108:15.56]Bugleberry and Phil Crazy.
[108:18.66]With the double.
[108:21.74]In it comes John Cena.
[108:26.84]They're chanting his name.
[108:27.86]Stop chanting his name.
[108:29.34]Shut up, everybody.
[108:30.60]Stop saying that.
[108:32.92]No, he's going to eliminate Chuck Schnozwell.
[108:34.76]You happy about that?
[108:35.92]Is that what you guys want to see?
[108:39.11]Don't say that.
[108:41.31]John Cena comes in.
[108:44.21]I forgot he was... I thought there was a mistake.
[108:46.27]I forgot I put him in here.
[108:48.48]Good.
[108:49.18]The drop kick him over the top.
[108:50.38]Fireman coming in at number 14.
[108:53.58]The EF Bugleberry has Bill Crazy now in a bad position.
[108:56.94]Fireman coming in instead of 30 at 14.
[108:59.42]Yeah, I want to see Fireman.
[109:03.23]I don't want to see John Cena.
[109:06.25]And now they both are working on Bill Crazy.
[109:08.25]There goes Bill Crazy.
[109:09.09]He's out.
[109:12.70]Add him to the list of people eliminated by BF Bill Blueberry.
[109:16.88]Ooh, right into the turnbuckle.
[109:18.02]Big fireman with an overhead throw.
[109:19.96]Throws over Chuck Schnoswell.
[109:23.44]And they're chanting... They're chanting some shit for John Cena.
[109:28.65]Oh, that's great.
[109:29.53]I'm so happy about this.
[109:32.63]Is he gonna do the thing where he puts the hand in front of his face?
[109:34.69]And, like, sneezes?
[109:36.53]Nice!
[109:36.93]The Hornet comes in with a big right hand.
[109:41.33]Will the Hornet stay in for more than 5 seconds this time?
[109:44.31]Maybe Cena John Cena So here's the question I have to ask you guys Is Is it possible here that Fireman near the Hornet Can we get an up in smoke potential scenario here?
[110:02.96]Glue Man coming in at 16 If you had one opportunity Glue Man it's right now Here's your shot
[110:12.78]By the way, I just want to make this very clear.
[110:15.30]The Glue Man shirt will be back on sale here.
[110:19.24]Oh!
[110:22.66]Not going to waste any time.
[110:24.05]Get rid of Cena, too.
[110:25.09]Fire yourself up, man.
[110:26.11]Come on.
[110:27.25]Get rid of Cena.
[110:29.27]Bingo.
[110:30.05]That's a double elimination, too, from Glue Man.
[110:33.73]He's like, fuck this, man.
[110:34.77]If this is going to be canon, I'm going to make this shit canon.
[110:38.19]I'm going to win this shit.
[110:40.37]Red blend wine coming in.
[110:45.32]Will Glue Mane and Bugleberry make this cannon?
[110:47.22]I wonder.
[110:51.12]That was odd.
[110:52.38]But nice work, Red Blend.
[110:54.00]Let me go ahead and... Ah.
[111:00.69]Glue Mane with a reversal to Red Blend.
[111:04.89]The best kind of wine you can drink.
[111:07.01]It actually is.
[111:09.37]A lot of wines are gross.
[111:10.59]Red Blend is the best of all red wines.
[111:13.25]Highly recommend it.
[111:15.97]You're a fucking weirdo.
[111:19.00]I know, that's not even true.
[111:19.92]That's not true.
[111:21.88]Alright, come on, Bugaberry, throw him over.
[111:23.74]Here comes the green screen.
[111:24.70]The green screen's stuck on the ropes.
[111:26.72]No, fuck you, green screen.
[111:36.91]No, he ruined another one.
[111:38.81]He ruined another rumble.
[111:40.73]He ruined another one.
[111:42.89]He's stuck on the ropes and he can't- the game crashed.
[111:50.29]It's like if I ain't winning, I'm bringing the whole fucking thing to the ground.
[112:03.46]I love and hate this.
[112:05.52]I fucking hate this because we were in the middle of this like it was- we were doing something.
[112:10.08]Fuck the green screen.
[112:16.49]Now it has to be canon all you guys that were so upset about this What what would you have me do about this you understand?

[112:42.79]I
[112:48.29]My computer is hard locked.
[113:06.71]The green screen is about to turn the stream off.
[113:08.37]You understand?
[113:13.61]That's un-fucking-believable.
[113:15.33]Hold on.
[113:20.98]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[113:21.68]I got it.
[113:21.96]I got it.
[113:24.16]No, I don't.
[113:26.51]I have access to my mouse, but I can't force quit the game.
[113:33.81]Oh, my God.
[113:34.53]I can't do anything.
[113:35.39]It's stuck here forever.
[113:36.59]There's nothing I can do.
[113:38.85]I have to, like... Control-Alt-Delete.
[113:45.26]I can't see the task manager because it's behind the game.
[113:53.22]Hold on.
[113:53.66]Can I pull it up from here?
[113:56.81]No, I can't.
[113:57.39]Yeah, alt-tab doesn't do anything.
[114:01.37]Hold on, wait a minute.
[114:01.89]Come on, come on, come on.
[114:05.79]No, I can't do anything.
[114:07.01]It's fucked.
[114:10.99]I'm force quitting the game right now and it's not doing anything.
[114:24.56]Why, of all things, I can't get out of it.
[114:32.32]Start a new desktop.
[114:37.86]Put Windows into a shutdown, then force the AXE to stop.
[114:41.06]Yeah, but then the computer turns off.
[114:45.92]Let me try this.
[114:48.33]Control Windows D. What does that do?
[114:53.19]Hold on.
[114:54.07]No.
[114:55.78]Oh, the whole thing's fucked.
[115:00.90]Physically remove your hard drive from your computer.
[115:04.54]If I could just get the task manager to, like, hold on, what if I do this?
[115:08.39]I gotta make one of my other monitors the main display.
[115:11.63]How the fuck can I even do that without seeing it?
[115:13.75]Uh-oh.
[115:19.68]Did I get it?
[115:22.32]Oh god, what the fuck have I done?
[115:25.56]Oh god, what's happening?

[115:42.17]Fuck!
[115:44.71]I can't do it!
[115:47.65]Why?
[115:48.11]Son of a bitch.
[115:57.26]I'm gonna have to, like, turn off the screen.
[116:01.74]I can't even see chat anymore.
[116:07.49]Force quitting it doesn't do anything.
[116:09.85]Fucking green screen.
[116:11.21]God damn it.
[116:13.95]No, I refuse to give up.
[116:17.71]What is this?
[116:19.07]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:23.94]This is bad.
[116:29.71]I'll be right, hold on, I'll be right back.
[117:03.05]Hey, how are you doing?
[117:12.06]Yeah, I had to force boot my computer.
[117:19.57]That's canon.
[117:20.05]I'm not changing it.
[117:20.73]There's no way.
[117:21.39]How can I change that now?
[117:22.15]Are you going to do another one?
[117:30.26]I mean, at this point, that's the way it is.
[117:38.77]Let's do something different.
[117:39.83]Let's do another one.
[117:40.41]Let's do like a, instead of a rumble, the universe is making me not do one.
[117:44.39]So let's do, let's do like a hardcore cage match or something with random characters.
[117:55.24]Hell in a Cell.
[117:55.78]Let's do Hell in a Cell.
[118:02.19]Green screen versus me in backstage rumble.
[118:04.67]I'm gonna lose.
[118:05.43]It's gonna crash the game.
[118:06.51]Look at all these fucking people.
[118:21.64]Jesus Christ.
[118:24.44]Alright.
[118:25.14]Are we talking about like alternate me or actual like old shitty me?
[118:34.45]Does anybody know what that picture is from?
[118:37.23]Please tell me you do.
[118:42.64]Yeah, that's from Twitter.
[118:50.88]Alright, let's do... See, I'm 97!
[118:53.50]Yeah, I do low blows, so I'm an asshole.
[118:57.46]Alright.
[118:59.66]Let's see if I can take the green screen down once and for all.
[119:02.86]See, 90- look, everyone that was talking shit about how the green screen is so powerful, you made the green screen, too.
[119:09.02]See, 92 versus 97.
[119:10.16]92!
[119:14.22]He's not that good.
[119:15.65]There's people that are like eight points higher than him.
[119:19.79]He's too big.
[119:20.55]Hey!
[119:23.41]No, he's not.
[119:23.93]Look at the Labo.
[119:25.03]Labo- okay, the Labo is just as big, just as heavy, and 95.
[119:30.58]And, uh, also, by the way, SweetRind is 92 and bigger.
[119:34.62]He's bigger than the green screen.
[119:42.40]Hold on, how is the green screen a super heavyweight?
[119:46.96]And nobody else, do I have, is he the only super heavyweight?
[119:50.96]How?
[119:51.70]How does that make any sense?
[119:56.75]Why is he a super heavyweight?
[120:04.35]There's another super heavyweight.
[120:05.70]Alright, I'm fucking kicking this guy's ass.
[120:10.70]He has poison mist.
[120:11.86]It's green.
[120:13.30]I figured maybe he was going to spit out green mist and it'd be funny.
[120:15.90]Alright, let's go.
[120:20.01]Backstage brawl.
[120:20.63]I'm going to kick the fucking green screen's ass.
[120:22.69]He even has like old 33-year-old shit Jerma.
[120:32.25]The green screen has to be big.
[120:33.53]He's huge.
[120:34.11]He's the size of a wall.
[120:41.15]Let's- Oh god.
[120:44.97]And here's the worst part about this.
[120:46.93]This is very keyable.
[120:48.58]You can put whatever you want there.
[120:50.74]So now I just fucked myself for like another four years.
[120:57.93]Come on!
[120:58.57]Get up and fight him.
[121:00.27]Get up and do anything.
[121:01.47]Do something.
[121:03.82]No, don't let him beat you like this.
[121:06.38]Somebody has to beat the green screen.
[121:13.16]Come on, dude.
[121:18.43]There it is!
[121:18.81]Ooh, he tripped.
[121:21.55]It's a little slippery over here.
[121:22.69]Alright, let's go into the bathroom.
[121:24.87]I'm gonna like flush you down the toilet.
[121:29.38]What?
[121:32.09]Oh, no.
[121:32.91]No.
[121:33.37]We're going to the TV.
[121:35.55]There's a desk.
[121:36.27]There's a table.
[121:38.67]Raw.
[121:39.83]Come on.
[121:40.07]Reverse it, Jerma.
[121:43.22]No.
[121:43.46]Get back in here.
[121:44.24]There's so much more interesting shit in here.
[121:47.32]God.
[121:47.66]This is going to turn into Scooby-Doo, isn't it?
[121:50.50]Alright.
[121:50.84]Into the TV.
[121:52.88]Just like... Nice.
[121:55.14]Nice lariat.
[122:05.87]Who the fuck is that?
[122:08.31]Who is this lady?
[122:09.87]What?
[122:10.21]Are we in somebody's office?
[122:14.45]Oh no, not the chair.
[122:17.75]Not the chair, green screen.
[122:19.44]Come on, it doesn't look like he's had enough already.
[122:25.82]This is a porn intro.
[122:28.76]Just key out the green screen.
[122:30.82]Can somebody please do that?
[122:32.78]For the green screen stream next weekend.
[122:35.09]Key this fucking guy out of here.
[122:37.27]What?
[122:38.57]No, don't do it.
[122:40.69]No.
[122:47.62]I'm still alive.
[122:48.94]I'm still alive.
[122:51.98]I'm persevering.
[122:52.88]That's one thing I got guaranteed for you.
[122:58.35]It didn't break.
[122:58.97]I don't weigh enough for it to break.
[123:01.76]I'm like 148 pounds.
[123:05.44]No, put him through it.
[123:06.66]Pick him up, Jerma.
[123:07.38]You can do it.
[123:16.30]Do something!
[123:18.64]Punch him!
[123:19.36]Throw him!
[123:20.84]Throw him through the TV!
[123:22.28]No, don't- not me!
[123:23.62]Oh my god.
[123:25.27]I tripped over the chair that was in the way, seriously.
[123:30.29]This is just sad.
[123:31.33]I'm just... It's like... I'm just getting bullied right now.
[123:42.01]I feel bad about this whole thing.
[123:45.40]Nobody can stop him.
[123:48.66]I lost.
[123:49.08]That's it.
[123:49.46]The game's over.
[123:52.28]No, it's not.
[123:54.06]Stay alive.
[123:55.44]Stay... Just... Just fucking electrocute him.
[123:59.77]Just like hitman style, walk him into water and fucking throw like a toaster at him.
[124:21.06]Come on!
[124:25.81]No, I got a better idea.
[124:27.25]I know who can fucking stop this motherfucker.
[124:54.51]Now you're fucked.
[124:56.60]You're dead.
[124:57.82]I'm channeling my Jax.
[124:58.94]I beat Jevil first try, guys.
[125:01.12]I beat Jevil first try.
[125:07.70]You want me to first try this guy too?
[125:10.19]Turn on the Jax.
[125:10.79]A little bit taller.
[125:16.47]Yeah.
[125:17.01]Yeah, push him.
[125:17.55]Come on.
[125:19.67]What the fuck?
[125:24.30]No, come on!
[125:26.42]This is my ultimate character.
[125:29.15]You can't get embarrassed right now.
[125:31.29]Oh my fucking lord.
[125:33.27]Don't get embarrassed.
[125:35.87]Kick his ass.
[125:44.11]All the germers fail to the green screen.
[125:46.61]No.
[125:47.41]That's not gonna happen.
[125:48.23]Jex is gonna come back.
[125:50.23]And he's gonna hit him in the head with an iron.
[126:01.21]He's a fucking hundred.
[126:03.41]You can't have better stats than Jex.
[126:08.03]Who's ironing?
[126:08.89]I'll open up a closet and find one.
[126:11.27]I don't need to have an iron.
[126:12.43]I'll find an iron.
[126:14.39]Alright, wipe the floor with him, Jex.
[126:15.63]Come on.
[126:17.61]Why won't you walk with him?
[126:19.53]You can't toy with the green screen.
[126:22.11]End him.
[126:28.07]That's not it, right?
[126:28.75]Okay, we're good.
[126:33.61]Come on, come back here.
[126:38.24]Nice, nice, very good, very good.
[126:46.72]Why do I care this much about this?
[126:49.68]I'm so upset with the green screen.
[126:51.80]Somebody has to beat him.
[126:57.21]Where are you taking me?
[127:00.23]Where are we going now?
[127:01.35]Oh my, I tripped over the speed bump.
[127:03.31]Give me a break.
[127:04.29]That's not a Jex move.
[127:08.59]What the fuck?
[127:10.42]There are attendants?
[127:11.88]There's a truck?
[127:19.02]Go to the car.
[127:20.62]Can we like run somebody over with the car?
[127:22.36]I will lose my mind if that happens.
[127:25.52]If Jekyll gets in the car and runs him over, I'll die on screen.
[127:29.64]You'll see me die on screen.
[127:37.58]Come on.
[127:39.30]Twist the elbow.
[127:40.06]He's like, no, I can't take that.
[127:42.28]There it is.
[127:42.72]There's the Jeremy Elbertson family line.
[127:45.66]I grab your wrist, I fall down, you fall down.
[127:48.94]That's been for generations.
[127:50.27]My father taught me that.
[127:52.50]You want to fuck somebody up in a fight?
[127:54.04]Just grab with two hands their fucking wrist and fall down as hard as you can.
[127:57.79]You're going to fuck them up.
[127:59.37]Guaranteed.
[128:04.35]Break his neck.
[128:05.63]Snap his neck.
[128:07.05]Come on, Jack.
[128:07.77]Snap his fucking neck.
[128:10.21]Ugh.
[128:15.35]No, come on.
[128:16.57]What?
[128:16.79]Give me a break.
[128:22.40]And watch out for the electricity.
[128:24.96]No, no, don't... Did I die?
[128:28.86]Is that... What?
[128:36.35]No!
[128:37.27]No!
[128:38.77]No!
[128:41.08]No!
[128:42.50]Come on.
[128:43.44]There's no way.
[128:49.50]I got fucking electrocuted.
[128:50.86]The thing that I said I wanted to do to him, he does to me.
[128:55.35]And I'm still alive.
[128:57.73]You can't stop, Jax.
[129:00.61]Even with electrocution.
[129:09.82]Get over to the cars.
[129:11.62]I want to see a car death.
[129:18.41]We need Super Jex.
[129:21.21]Should I make Super Jex?
[129:23.77]Just make him like seven feet tall?
[129:28.80]Just turn him like green and make him like fucking eight feet tall?
[129:37.34]Why is this turning into a DBZ timeline?
[129:41.09]Oh, I can't beat him as regular Jex, so I have to go Super Jex!
[129:52.25]That's it.
[129:57.13]No, that's not it.
[129:58.15]What?
[129:59.65]No, don't taunt.
[130:00.59]What are you doing?
[130:22.65]What the fuck did we just watch?
[130:51.49]Oh, my fucking back hurts.
[130:55.01]I thought I won.
[131:00.07]It's time to bring in Adam Sandler.
[131:04.81]Fuck it.
[131:06.51]We're going with the real, the real S tier.
[131:18.86]Get it.
[131:19.28]Fucking Adam Sandler.
[131:20.26]Where is he?
[131:28.35]Somebody.
[131:28.87]Come on.
[131:29.17]He's 79.
[131:29.97]He sucks.
[131:37.54]Let's go.
[131:38.46]Come on, Sandler.
[131:40.88]If it doesn't work, we're going to combine Jex and Sandler.
[131:44.04]We're going to make super Adam Sandler Jex.
[131:47.97]Alright.
[131:48.23]Come on, Sandler.
[131:49.95]It's always backstage.
[131:51.79]I wonder what's going to happen.
[131:52.65]He's going to push him and he's going to punch him in the face.
[132:05.89]We just said Adam Sandler to his death
[132:31.31]This wasn't even an attempt.
[132:32.45]He's 79 and he's a piece of shit.
[132:38.67]I really thought he was gonna snap his neck right there.
[132:40.29]I was about to fucking lose my mind.
[132:43.91]Get electrocuted!
[132:45.31]Electro- Sandler, electrocute!
[132:48.03]Sandler, use electrocute!
[132:52.71]No, don't get electrocuted.
[132:54.69]Oh my god.
[133:00.32]Come on, fight back.
[133:02.18]Use the Metacritic score of your last six movies to combine into like 72%.
[133:06.52]God damn it, man.
[133:11.34]I'm gonna die.
[133:23.32]Where are you taking him?
[133:24.22]This is just bad.
[133:26.19]Take him into the car.
[133:28.21]Powerbomb Adam Sandler through the roof of the car.
[133:31.97]And I will piss my pants.
[133:33.15]Pee will come out of my fucking penis.
[133:35.55]It just... That will happen.
[133:38.91]Oh, what a reversal!
[133:40.45]Holy shit!
[133:42.41]That was an absolute... That was a beautiful reversal.
[133:50.24]Oh, come on.
[133:50.82]Don't let that be the end.
[133:52.54]Is that the end?
[133:55.66]It always ends right here.
[133:57.26]Can we not end in the fucking hallway?
[134:00.13]Excuse me.
[134:01.85]Excuse me, attendant.
[134:02.97]Fire extinguisher.
[134:03.71]Get it.
[134:05.67]Sandler, if you're smart, you're gonna get that fire extinguisher and you're gonna throw it in his face.
[134:11.95]Nice.
[134:12.33]Come on.
[134:15.03]He did it.
[134:15.61]Is that it?
[134:17.15]No, it's never it.
[134:17.89]He's like Michael Myers, man.
[134:19.35]You can't taunt before...
[134:26.64]These really are like Microsoft 3D Movie Maker sound effects.
[134:38.58]Get out to the cars.
[134:39.52]At least finish it on the cars, guys.
[134:42.46]Nice parry.
[134:44.68]No, don't take him back here.
[134:54.02]Uh, I'll tell you one thing.
[134:55.32]Green screen is slow to get up.
[134:59.33]Now where are we going?
[135:01.41]All the way down this hallway.
[135:03.45]Wherever the hell this is.
[135:04.35]He's doing the, I'm gonna end this taunt.
[135:08.94]Uh, that's it.
[135:09.88]He's gonna taunt.
[135:11.10]While he's lying on the ground, you had an opportunity there.
[135:13.54]Nice job.
[135:15.10]Fucking idiot.
[135:21.77]This is three matches in a row.
[135:22.89]He's tired.
[135:29.95]And now people are booing.
[135:30.85]I don't blame them.
[135:31.49]I would be booing too.
[135:32.37]No, that... he's... Come on, Sandler.
[135:38.53]No, is it over?
[135:39.33]What's going on with his legs?
[135:43.53]I mean, he's prepping up like a finishing move.
[135:47.66]No, that's... he does it every time.
[135:49.66]And he wins with that every time.
[135:53.41]What are you doing?
[136:01.11]Adam Sandler is fine.
[136:03.33]No, he's not.
[136:03.90]What are you doing?
[136:13.42]He's gonna break his leg.
[136:19.87]Get up.
[136:20.97]Don't get choked out.
[136:22.23]Oh my god.
[136:27.18]Look, he's limp.
[136:28.42]Did you see that leg?
[136:29.41]Did you see how fucked up that was?
[136:31.91]This is bad.
[136:34.73]Adam Sandler is limp right now.
[136:36.35]This is fucking sad.
[136:39.10]Saddler.
[136:41.10]And with that, a reversal!
[136:45.14]He's not gonna be Adam Saddler for all.
[137:05.04]Come on Sadler He's got him in the chokeslam!
[137:08.88]This is his finishing move Do it!
[137:11.80]Holy shit, did he win?
[137:14.91]He wins right?
[137:15.61]Come on, that's the Sandler chokeslam Dude, no!
[137:27.56]You can't.
[137:31.30]Oh, this is going on for a long time.
[137:45.51]I'm gonna fucking die.
[137:46.71]I need to stop.
[137:48.27]I need to like look away from the screen.
[138:00.49]Come on.
[138:07.65]Break his neck.
[138:11.60]Oh, what a fucking recovery.
[138:30.07]Oh my God.
[138:30.89]Oh, I need to stop.
[138:32.51]I need to stop looking at the screen.
[138:41.60]This is fucking stupid.
[138:52.25]Alright, it's done.
[139:01.23]Is that like Super Jax?
[139:02.69]Fuck this guy.
[139:06.82]Are you kidding me?
[139:28.36]It sounded overclocked for me.
[139:30.02]Why is it Willem Dafoe?
[139:31.44]I don't know.
[139:33.41]Okay.
[139:33.67]Alright.
[139:34.47]It's time to make fucking super jacks.
[139:42.13]Let's fucking power them up.
[139:43.07]You know what I mean?
[139:44.11]Like, feed them up.

[140:35.11]That looks gross because it's so good.
[140:42.73]Fucking veins everywhere.
[140:49.32]We are meticulously making a creature, a person that will absolutely never be beaten.
[140:55.66]Ever.
[140:59.61]Give him a nice ass, too.
[141:01.11]No, no, no, no.
[141:01.67]It's gonna be like a fatter one.
[141:04.47]What?
[141:06.73]What the fuck am I talking about?
[141:07.89]No.
[141:14.14]There we go.

[141:17.10]The huge ones.
[141:18.86]The fucking Thanksgiving turkey legs.
[141:24.10]And we're gonna make them glow.
[141:26.35]It's gonna be obnoxious how much he glows.
[141:29.09]Look at these.
[141:30.25]Nobody has legs like this.
[141:31.34]Gonna put oil all over his body so it's slippery and shit.

[141:46.83]We're not even done.
[142:18.22]Fucking RGB glasses, look at those.
[142:20.86]Those are like a thousand dollars.
[142:37.67]Make them fucking shine.

[143:12.15]100. 100.
[143:26.35]Gold hair, too?
[143:27.11]Oh, you better believe it.
[143:35.44]And he's getting fucking DBZ hair.
[143:47.53]Yeah, fuck this material.
[143:49.07]If it ain't glowing in gold, I don't want it.
[144:06.27]That's maximum gold intensity.
[144:14.50]Look at that shit.
[144:15.40]He looks fucking absolutely fabulous.
[144:18.40]Alright.
[144:19.56]Now it's time for the hair.
[144:29.32]Macaroni pants?
[144:41.16]He thought I was kidding.
[144:41.84]We're actually doing, like, the Super Saiyan hair.
[144:58.27]Ah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:59.06]Hold on.
[144:59.30]Excuse me.
[145:11.88]And... And he's getting an Infinity Gauntlet.
[145:24.17]This... I want to make sure he fucking wins guaranteed.
[145:54.48]We can only have one stone.
[145:55.90]The power stone.
[146:00.70]That's the only fucking one that matters anyways.
[146:05.34]Give him two infinity gauntlets.
[146:08.54]Okay.
[146:14.64]Was it the mind stone?
[146:15.62]What's the other most expensive fucking thing in the world?
[146:18.92]Expensive.
[146:21.48]I mean, you know what I'm saying.
[146:23.02]It's blue, right?
[146:26.86]Give him a Sans Eye.
[146:29.00]I can't give him a Sans Eye.
[146:32.64]I can't make a Sans Eye.
[146:37.14]There's no, I don't have a, I can't make a Sans Eye.
[146:42.59]Sans Eye, Sans Eye.
[147:19.68]Close enough.
[147:33.16]Wrong eye.
[147:34.82]Well, he can have it in both eyes.
[147:39.32]No, I can't do wrong.
[147:40.98]I can't change the eye.
[147:43.43]Do you understand?
[147:44.13]It's only that.
[147:45.33]That's it.
[147:45.85]That's your Sans eye.
[147:55.64]You can?
[147:56.16]What do you mean you can?
[147:57.06]How?

[149:06.57]That's what we're gonna do.
[149:09.65]In fucking, like, blood.
[149:22.56]Now, you know what else he's gonna fucking have?
[149:25.63]He's gonna channel fucking beanbag Sonic.
[150:11.12]No, there's a reason why I didn't put him in the game.
[150:13.65]You understand?
[151:05.89]Now I have it on my chest.
[151:06.85]That means it's fucking real.
[151:26.83]Okay.

[153:54.96]Level... Level three.
[154:06.19]Done.
[154:16.43]Let's see it.
[154:21.42]All level three.
[154:21.98]You can't have everything level three.
[154:25.08]Let's watch the absolute destruction of the grand screen.
[154:34.01]All level three.
[154:36.37]Hold on.
[154:37.19]Where is he?
[154:47.61]Oh, that's great He's a hundred everything Okay, let's do this
[155:16.10]Everything level 3.
[155:17.88]Literal god.
[155:19.22]And the payback is, look at this.
[155:21.34]Teleport behind your opponent.
[155:23.08]Uh, sure.
[155:24.34]Instant recovery.
[155:27.08]The buff enhances your... Buff.
[155:33.23]Save it.
[155:34.09]Let's go.
[155:55.42]He's ready.
[155:55.76]Alright, now let's play... What's that song from... What's that song from fucking My Hero Academia?
[156:07.75]I don't like watch anime.
[156:09.29]I've watched like one.
[156:15.31]I've only seen one anime.
[156:22.45]One on one.
[156:25.26]Backstage Brawl.
[156:28.26]Super Jax.
[156:29.38]Good fucking luck.
[156:30.56]92.
[156:30.58]Give me a break.
[156:31.12]Okay.
[156:31.32]Okay.
[157:09.64]Acid base.
[157:11.02]Good call.
[157:16.44]That's a good call.
[157:25.30]Let me get it ready.
[157:28.26]What am I going to chat?
[157:38.89]We're gonna get to see Super Jex fucking just absolutely dunk on somebody, so.
[157:45.61]Here we go.
[157:50.97]Make sure it's fucking loud enough, you know what I mean?
[158:05.80]Come on, Super Jex!
[158:07.74]This is what you were made for.
[158:09.24]You were created for this one fucking moment.
[158:11.41]Super Jax versus green screen.
[158:17.57]Oh, you think you're tall?
[158:18.75]You think you're like as tall as me?
[158:20.60]I don't think so.
[158:24.10]You wanna talk shit?
[158:25.60]Let's go!
[158:39.63]Super Jack!
[158:44.11]Come on, Super!
[158:51.26]No fucking way!
[158:54.46]Come on, turn up, Super Jacks!
[158:55.94]Turn the fuck up!
[159:08.39]What?! !
[159:24.79]Dude, are you really going to let Adam Sandler do a better job than you?
[159:28.28]Give me a fucking break.
[159:30.62]Powerbomb him through a glass table.
[159:35.82]You got two Infinity Gauntlets.
[159:37.92]Two Infinity Gauntlets.
[159:44.45]That's 640 pounds.
[159:47.01]He's immutable.
[159:49.07]He's unbeatable.
[159:51.85]Come on, Super Jack.
[159:59.95]Where are you taking him?
[160:01.43]Oh my god.
[160:03.89]He's only fighting at 20%.
[160:04.73]No, I mean very clearly he's lit the fuck up at like 120%.
[160:07.75]This is the comeback right here.
[160:11.69]What are you doing?
[160:14.80]What?
[160:15.20]You just missed like four times.
[160:17.54]You can't... What are you doing?
[160:22.10]Wait, why is the meme funeral about to play autoplay?
[160:39.08]What the fuck is pla- BREAK HIS NECK!
[160:42.09]BREAK HIS FUCKING NECK!
[160:43.73]SNAP IT!
[160:45.03]COME ON SUPERJECK!
[160:58.25]Yes!
[161:02.71]Oh, shut up.
[161:02.97]No, I don't.
[161:03.35]We did it.
[161:03.71]Super Jax.
[161:32.23]Timeline has been restored.
[161:33.45]Now I need to make a super green screen.
[161:45.84]No.
[161:47.56]And then we got to put him in a fucking hell in a cell.
[161:56.20]Oh, God damn it.
[161:57.16]Why?
[162:10.52]Hold on.
[162:12.46]I gotta duplicate it.
[162:16.86]And make him gold.
[162:18.81]And then I gotta put him in a Hell in a Cell.
[162:21.63]The ultimate battle.
[162:24.29]Look at how good that Willem Dafoe is.
[162:26.67]I'm sorry.
[162:27.24]That's fucking perfect.
[162:29.34]What a perfect Willem Dafoe.
[162:43.92]He's as big as he can get.
[162:46.00]He's six.
[162:46.86]He already is there.
[162:50.78]Make him a blue screen.
[162:52.59]Super gold screen.
[162:54.09]Well, no, he has to be a gold screen.
[162:56.51]Blue screen?
[163:04.31]God damn it.
[163:08.01]Sans blue screen.
[163:09.37]Forget about the sans.
[163:19.24]Let's see, gold?
[163:21.14]He kind of has to be a gold screen.
[163:25.46]I mean, he just does.
[163:34.71]Blue or riot?
[163:35.87]Can he have a gold head?
[163:39.17]Blue?
[163:45.79]Can he have like a gold face?
[163:54.74]This is going to be unbearable to look at.
[163:56.58]This is going to be awful on the eyes.
[164:04.79]Gold X's?
[164:05.59]Okay, that makes sense.
[164:09.82]It's going to be a pain in the ass to put all those up.
[164:17.74]Jesus fucking Christ.
[164:19.88]It already hurts my head.
[164:37.51]time if you guys are curious as to how long it makes to make a character like just to make one I mean you painstakingly go through and do this that's not showing up well
[165:08.65]Maybe orange will work.
[165:10.35]Like a dark orange.
[165:13.43]Give it a gold look.
[165:23.78]It's just Dr. Manhattan.
[165:24.90]That's what it's turning into.
[165:27.08]And then make Giga Sandler.
[165:31.31]We're going too deep, I think.
[165:35.37]If I make the material different...
[165:40.38]Gigasandler.
[165:44.31]I'll just make it darker blue.
[165:46.21]That's the only way it's gonna work.
[165:58.60]That's okay.
[166:00.34]No, that's fine.
[166:02.88]It's glowing.
[166:03.46]Anyways, the blue is a different looking blue, but because it's glowing, I wonder if we can make it darker.
[166:17.21]Yes, we can.
[166:17.83]But I don't want to go to like purple though.
[166:22.29]That looks good.
[166:23.97]That's the correct looking blue, I think.
[166:27.42]Remember, it is glowing.
[166:30.10]He looks like a tube of toothpaste.
[166:31.30]I'm sorry.
[166:31.72]Well, it's fucking super green screen.
[166:35.60]You think I'm going to change his name?
[166:52.70]Super sweet, right?
[166:54.12]We're going too deep.
[166:55.34]That's too deep!
[167:12.21]That looks good.
[167:13.97]I gotta fix the other one though.
[167:22.50]Giga rind.
[167:25.60]You gotta see how you can just get lost in these games, right?
[167:39.51]What the fuck does that person even mean?
[167:42.43]What does that mean?
[167:45.40]What does that even mean?
[167:46.68]I can't even, I don't even know what that means!
[167:56.97]Alright, that's fine.
[167:57.69]Wait, is that the right color?
[168:01.31]Is that the right color?
[168:06.01]Now it is.
[168:11.12]There's so many X's on him.
[168:21.36]I'm going as fast as I can.
[168:30.95]1, 2, 3, 1... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[168:48.64]Thankfully, it's already in place, and I have to spend like an hour making this.
[168:53.30]Takes about 30 to... 30 minutes to an hour to make every character.
[168:56.96]Think about how easy they are.
[168:59.92]So if you can imagine 36 characters, it was about 30 to 40 hours to make everything.
[169:06.30]But I love it.
[169:08.48]I have so much fun just making weird shit.
[169:16.82]No, don't emboss it.
[169:21.68]I need to make it glow, man.
[169:23.58]Material.
[169:25.20]There we go.
[169:36.12]because even like this this shit I'm doing right now you wouldn't imagine it would take long but time just melts the fuck away and this shit is already here and this guy is like a fairly simple person glue man god form okay that's alright and then the one the two in the back oh he's got four in the back actually
[170:05.29]Well, here's a little behind the scenes of how things work when you make characters in these games.
[170:19.55]Fuck.
[170:20.07]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[170:25.59]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[170:40.21]Still angry that the game crashed when he was doing it, when Gloomit was doing it.
[170:42.99]I know!
[170:43.47]I don't know why that seems to happen every time we do these.
[170:49.23]Blue screen of death, green screen.
[170:51.89]Alright, almost done.
[170:53.53]Only two more.
[171:04.62]Thankfully, I'm familiar with the menus too, because I'd be like, wait, where do I go?
[171:08.36]What, what, what, what does this do?
[171:19.51]Why is his head there?
[171:20.41]The head will be changed, don't worry.
[171:22.71]The head's gonna get changed.
[171:25.13]Alright, there's all the markers, gold markers glowing.
[171:31.33]So now we're gonna go to the head.
[171:34.78]Hands too need to be changed.
[171:36.38]Edit them.
[171:39.90]That's fine.
[171:40.76]Make them glow.
[171:41.52]And make them that blue.
[171:44.24]That matches pretty well.
[171:49.52]Good.
[171:51.16]Pretty good.
[171:52.13]Okay.
[171:58.57]Fucking giga blue screen.
[172:02.15]That's it.
[172:04.07]Let's make his head the right color.
[172:11.28]He's already glowing.
[172:12.18]That's good.
[172:17.96]Matches pretty well.
[172:18.66]I'm going to change the material, though.
[172:20.18]No, I'm not, because that would take the glow off.
[172:22.04]That's good.
[172:26.65]He's so oily and shiny.
[172:33.24]Alright, gotta do his feet.
[172:35.94]He's wearing just green socks.
[172:41.64]That doesn't match.
[172:44.48]It's weird because sometimes you pick the same color, but it just doesn't match.
[172:48.13]That's close enough, I think, right here.
[172:52.93]Maybe a little bit darker.
[173:03.82]Oh, because it needs to be glowing, right?
[173:08.96]Alright, he's done.
[173:11.40]There's Giga Blue Screen.
[173:16.62]I don't know how... There he is.
[173:20.62]Hair?
[173:21.08]I can't put hair on him.
[173:26.19]put goku hair on him I can't I can't I can't should I just take the mask off and give him goku hair I can't hair can't go here's the thing here's the most infuriating thing about WWE since 2k14 okay here's a major complaint you
[173:51.13]Half of the stuff for clothing and masks and face masks and headgear is not compatible with half of the other stuff in the game.
[173:58.83]So, for instance, look at this.
[173:59.73]Ready?
[173:59.93]Like, appearance, right?
[174:01.74]Even clothing.
[174:02.96]Let me go to, like, upper body, for instance.
[174:04.50]And, like, oh, jackets.
[174:06.20]So, there are a bunch of shit.
[174:08.26]Like, I can't put any of these on.
[174:10.84]None of these can go on.
[174:12.46]See that in the lower left corner?
[174:15.20]That means it can only be put on during an entrance.
[174:19.78]Look at, that's like half the fucking list is unusable.
[174:23.76]And then you run into the problem of, you see the ones with the, these on the X's here?
[174:26.92]See the lower left?
[174:28.42]I literally have to take off my mask to put this jacket on.
[174:34.40]Oh, you want to put this shirt on?
[174:35.63]No, no, no, no, you have to take off the mask.
[174:38.71]I don't, I don't understand why.
[174:40.27]More than half the options are not usable together.
[174:45.21]And that's been happening since 2K14.
[174:48.33]It seems like 2K, whatever, ukes and visual concepts, they're so concerned.
[174:53.81]They are so fucking concerned about clipping that they make it so you can't customize the character.
[174:59.77]Like they're so scared that if I put this on, it's going to clip through the mask.
[175:05.03]Who gives a shit?
[175:09.50]It limits so many of the, like I thought, like, oh, this is a cool, look at this jacket.
[175:12.72]The puffy blue jacket, this exact thing.
[175:14.62]Nope.
[175:14.90]Can't use it.
[175:15.31]Sorry.
[175:15.79]Move on.
[175:16.81]I can use this one though.
[175:19.83]It's the same reason why you can't put on, like, look at this.
[175:25.27]Like, see, like, uh, like torso accessories or something.
[175:27.77]They see, look like, why can't I put this on?
[175:30.39]I can't put this on, but I can put these on.
[175:34.40]Why?
[175:34.54]Why?
[175:36.60]Is this- what?
[175:38.00]I could put a fucking rubber ducky on for an entrance, but I can't put on a scarf.
[175:43.65]I have to take off the mask.
[175:47.67]Put it on.
[175:55.29]Did you see?
[175:56.57]See how dumb this is?
[176:06.26]Go back, go back.
[176:07.98]See, now if I make that mistake, I have to put everything back on.
[176:13.58]See, I have to go all the way back.
[176:16.84]Neck accessories.
[176:17.70]What have we got for neck accessories in WWE?
[176:20.70]Oh, I can put headphones.
[176:21.80]No, you can't.
[176:22.80]No, you can't do that.
[176:24.36]Oh, what about... No, sorry, you can't do that either.
[176:26.28]Oh.
[176:27.62]Oh, and all of these I can't use unless I'm at an entrance.
[176:32.02]I can't... No, I can't put that on.
[176:36.94]Visual Concepts and Yuke's.
[176:38.04]If you're watching this right now, nobody gives a shit if it's gonna clip through the fucking back of the mask.
[176:43.19]Nobody cares.
[176:44.61]Put it back.
[176:45.43]Let us fucking put the shit on that we want to put on.
[176:46.95]For the love of God.
[176:52.29]Like nobody gives a shit if this is gonna like clip through my head or if this is like, I can only put this on an entrance.
[176:57.79]No, I don't care.
[176:58.79]I can't just have this on in the match.
[177:00.99]Why?
[177:05.11]It just doesn't make any sense.
[177:08.53]But anyways, use the neck feathers.
[177:24.76]Like why can I use this but not like the headphones?
[177:28.84]It doesn't make any sense.
[177:42.04]Golden duck, you're not even gonna get to see it.
[177:45.59]The duck is only, I can't even put it on.
[177:47.05]Oh, sorry, you can't use this.
[177:50.13]Let's limit 45% of every item in the whole game.
[177:54.15]You know, I do consulting work, 2K.
[178:01.00]I do consulting work.
[178:03.88]You need a consultant.
[178:10.98]Gold neck, alright.
[178:16.29]Still glowing, that's fine.
[178:23.47]Well, if we're going that far, we might as well do this.
[179:36.61]I don't even care about Sans.
[179:40.03]Stop this right now.
[179:42.38]What am I doing?
[179:43.10]I'm just like adding.
[179:47.70]I'm adding and adding and adding and adding.
[180:10.36]No, I don't like these.
[180:11.26]I don't like them.
[180:11.94]Get rid of them.
[180:21.09]Alright, stats.
[180:28.75]No, that was... It's like a fucking cartoon character.
[180:35.84]Put his name on his chest.
[180:37.22]Super green screen, right?
[181:04.96]There you go Take it off!
[181:26.72]No, it's a blue screen of death!
[181:40.41]Ruined what bringing ruin It's nasty remove it I'm gonna keep it Disgusting No, it's staying there
[182:08.54]Give him a gold thong.
[182:12.09]I mean, I kind of have to.
[182:13.35]I can't.
[182:14.25]I can't do that.
[182:15.69]Would you like me to do that?
[182:17.51]Oh, look at all these options.
[182:19.02]Look at all.
[182:19.44]Wow.
[182:19.86]Look at these options.
[182:21.08]Oh, wow.
[182:23.39]Oh.
[182:25.04]I sure wish I could put him on.
[182:26.56]No, look at the hundreds of fucking options.
[182:29.78]No, no, no, no.
[182:30.56]I can't.
[182:30.86]Sorry.
[182:31.24]You can't do that.
[182:32.06]Sorry.
[182:32.36]It gets underneath.
[182:33.24]You can't put it over.
[182:34.24]I'm sorry.
[182:35.48]Sorry, sir.
[182:36.51]Did you want to create a custom character?
[182:38.19]No.
[182:45.71]Get a JPG of a thong.
[183:00.83]Give me a second.
[183:36.33]Uploading it now.

[184:59.89]I'm putting a fucking gold thong on him.
[185:09.76]Why the thong?
[185:10.46]Somebody told me to do it.
[185:17.02]If you're new to the stream...
[185:19.34]Just listen, this is important.
[185:21.36]If you're a new viewer or if you're an old viewer, you're not sure.
[185:24.88]If one person, one guy, one person said to do that, okay, you will eventually be the one guy that I take the request.
[185:36.27]You'll be the one guy at some point.
[185:38.39]You can't give shit to the one guy when you'll be the one guy some point soon.
[185:43.92]Let me download my community fucking thing.
[185:51.27]It's not even- it's pink.
[186:00.16]Well, that kind of fucks that whole thing up, doesn't it?
[186:07.72]Super blue screen of death!
[186:11.27]I can't even change the color.
[186:13.03]That person's right.
[186:13.97]That one guy's right.
[186:18.42]I'm not making super willow, no, hold on, just wait.
[186:43.29]It's only the front.
[186:45.64]It's only the front, just hold on.
[186:53.11]I can't even, yes I can, I can change the color.
[186:55.68]No, I can't.
[187:28.09]I gotta at least make it match.
[187:44.92]It's like riding up his ass so bad.
[187:55.82]What the fuck did this achieve?
[187:59.96]This didn't cheat anything.
[189:25.85]No, what am I doing?
[189:26.65]I'm thinking like an arrow.
[189:28.09]Get this out of here.
[189:29.04]Delete this.
[189:30.08]What am I- what are you doing?
[189:31.56]No, no, no, no.
[189:32.42]Get out of here.
[189:34.56]Okay, we're fine.
[189:36.70]Oh, fuck.
[189:37.25]Juicy's gone.
[189:59.20]What was I doing?
[190:01.78]Arrow to like my crotch.
[190:16.45]Alright, we're good.
[190:24.35]It went off the rails real quick, really quickly.
[190:31.14]Alright.
[190:31.44]No, I gotta do the stats.
[190:32.18]I gotta make sure the stats are 100.
[190:36.81]Remember the fight?
[190:39.67]Yeah, I do.
[190:47.78]So many fucking people.
[190:49.00]Where are you?
[191:06.03]Okay, SuperBSOD from Las Vegas.
[191:10.63]It's true.
[191:11.83]Alright, let's go.
[191:19.20]Wasn't this supposed to only be like a two to three hour stream?
[191:22.06]Yeah, this is the encore.
[191:25.60]I mean, the event already happened.
[191:27.44]The green screen won.
[191:28.68]Twice.
[191:31.98]So, we're just kind of having fun, sticking around now.
[191:46.25]Alright, actually 100.
[191:47.99]All level 3 skills.
[192:00.53]And here is the final match of this particular circuit.
[192:06.33]We spent so much time on these two idiots.
[192:11.57]Menu pose.
[192:22.71]done he's doing a jojo pose no he's not thank you for the thong you're welcome one guy out of 7 000 people what have I done to him I made him that much more powerful alright let's go
[192:46.82]While this loads, I'm gonna go grab another drink.
[192:49.14]Because why not, right?
[192:52.64]One-on-one Hell in a Cell.
[193:01.26]Super Jex versus Super Blue Screen of Death.
[193:07.96]There are no rules in Hell in a Cell.
[193:16.82]Alright.
[193:18.46]For the entrances, here they come.
[193:19.68]I'm going to grab a drink.
[193:21.52]I'm not sure these two even have entrances.
[193:25.03]I'll be right back.
[193:26.43]See you in a second.
[193:27.33]Watch the intros.
[193:31.07]I can't... Why can I not turn my... My stream doesn't want to... Hold on.
[193:38.11]It really... It's going to be so much brighter than this.
[193:40.89]Because that's not even a rendered light source.
[193:49.72]I still can't do it.
[193:50.74]Why the fuck not?
[193:52.86]Well, apparently I can't mute my microphone, so whatever.
[193:55.19]We're in Illinois.
[193:56.03]See you in a second.
[193:57.99]It's going to be the same two entrances back-to-back because I never gave them that.
[196:29.88]It started.
[196:30.98]It started already?
[196:32.06]What?
[196:33.56]Oh my god, what did I miss?
[196:35.60]What did I miss?
[196:41.89]Nothing.
[196:42.27]It just, okay, just started.
[196:43.37]Good.
[196:44.81]So if you don't know the Hell in a Cell rules, the only way you can win is by pinning.
[196:50.41]You just have to pin the guy.
[196:51.19]That's it.
[196:53.45]But, but, super juicy, by the way.
[196:58.36]We've got the two strongest competitors that have ever been in a Jerma Rumble.
[197:01.86]Ever.
[197:04.70]We've got the Super Blue Screen of Death.
[197:07.40]And Super Jex.
[197:11.21]Mere mortals are in attendance right now.
[197:15.67]What about Zaraxos?
[197:17.45]Well, Zaraxos is the most powerful in the Underworld.
[197:20.63]We're talking about on Earth.
[197:24.78]I wonder if... I'm going to go for a pin here.
[197:26.91]Super Jax on blue screen of death.
[197:29.87]No, not even a one count.
[197:30.99]This is going to be like a four hour long match.
[197:36.95]We're just watching gods fight each other.
[197:42.58]That fucking thong.
[197:46.16]So Raxos is not even in their league.
[197:48.06]He's a commoner.
[197:48.86]I mean, he doesn't glow, so there's that.
[197:56.68]I wonder if we're going to see any... Alright, now we're going to the outside here.
[198:00.19]Are we going to get to see some hell in a cell mayhem?
[198:06.47]They're locked in here until somebody wins.
[198:09.55]Reversal there by Super Blue Screen of Death.
[198:12.72]On to the corner.
[198:15.94]Falls over the steps.
[198:18.32]Play music.
[198:21.64]Hold on, mute...
[198:25.74]Uh-oh, you can- ah, this is a spoiler right here!
[198:30.70]You can like, see their stats!
[198:36.48]Fighting music.
[198:40.58]This is called best fight music.
[198:48.95]Okay, so here's best fight music.
[198:53.01]Oh, people are gonna hate this.
[199:15.80]Let's get the stream copyright-striked, what do you say?
[199:22.78]Oh, what a reversal by Blue Screen of Death!
[199:28.19]No, that better not be it.
[199:30.56]One, two, oh.
[199:37.24]Jax is bleeding from the face.
[199:41.66]The signature choke move from Blue Screen of Death.
[199:44.80]They've both evolved since the beginning of this stream.
[199:51.24]Can Super Jax make it a two for two?
[200:05.92]That's the fucking move.
[200:07.32]Pass down the Elbertson line.
[200:13.28]Nobody can stop Super Jax.
[200:15.73]Not even God himself.
[200:20.59]Here it comes.
[200:22.07]Here it comes.
[200:22.49]The diaper.
[200:23.63]The diaper.
[200:32.57]On the top rope.
[200:34.00]This is live, by the way.
[200:35.26]Look at the top right corner.
[200:36.06]It's live.
[200:37.84]Hurricane Rana.
[200:39.36]No, no.
[200:39.98]Reversal.
[200:47.05]And a spear.
[200:48.47]Can he get the pin?
[200:49.91]What a pathetic way to end.
[200:56.43]Does Jex have it in him?
[200:57.55]Can Jex possibly recover here?
[200:59.38]I don't think it's possible.
[201:03.36]Reversal!
[201:04.66]Oh!
[201:11.13]There's nothing that can be done.
[201:12.53]Jex is going to lose.
[201:18.65]He's going to the top rope to crash the computer.
[201:22.40]Wait a minute.
[201:24.50]Wait a minute.
[201:27.30]Can he?
[201:28.60]No, he can't.
[201:34.10]No, he can't.
[201:35.68]He can't.
[201:36.86]He can't.
[201:37.88]But wait, he dodged it.
[201:39.98]No, they both suck.
[201:42.18]Gods among men.
[201:49.20]Out to the outside again.
[201:57.31]Do a spirit bomb.
[201:58.57]Do anything.
[202:00.76]Climb on top of the cage and fucking kill somebody.
[202:06.17]Powerbomb him from the top of the cage and kill him.
[202:14.00]Backwards.
[202:15.74]Oh, there it is.
[202:18.62]The backwards move.
[202:19.90]Is that gonna be enough?
[202:21.56]One.
[202:21.70]Two.
[202:23.23]No.
[202:23.61]No.
[203:25.42]Let's go!
[203:32.47]That's... Powerbomb pin?
[203:35.41]Two!
[203:36.31]Three!
[203:36.65]No, that's not it!
[203:37.39]That's not it!
[203:39.89]Wait, what is it?
[203:40.51]What?
[203:42.25]Why is the referee running away?
[203:45.71]What are you doing?
[203:47.57]Check him!
[203:56.49]What is happening?
[204:01.27]This is so loud.
[204:02.65]This is so- He just pinned him again?
[204:04.99]One... Two... He didn't get- It's too much for me.
[204:47.97]Crash it.
[204:51.27]Ooh, two!
[204:54.47]And a backspinning soccer ball kick!
[205:00.12]Can he go all the way here?
[205:04.08]All he needed was the default YouTuber elevator music.
[205:08.50]Was that gonna be enough?
[205:10.74]One!
[205:11.72]Two!
[205:13.10]Three!
[205:13.32]He just did it!
[205:14.26]He did... That was lame.
[205:16.66]That's... They didn't even go on the top of the cell.
[205:25.37]That's fucking stupid.
[205:26.53]I don't even want to see this.
[205:47.47]8-man.
[205:47.73]8-man fucking ladder match.
[205:52.71]No.
[205:52.97]8-man battle royale.
[206:01.91]8-man ladder?
[206:02.61]That's not gonna work.
[206:05.35]Ladder tag?
[206:06.21]4-way?
[206:06.99]Ladder 4-way tag?
[206:11.52]What is it I tell him?
[206:13.94]Turn entrances off.
[206:16.64]Battle Royale.
[206:17.50]Can I change the rules?
[206:25.67]Oh, let me see here.
[206:28.85]Ladder.
[206:29.79]What if I don't do Ape Man?
[206:36.65]Is it Rumble?
[206:37.82]How do I... Rumble Tournament.
[206:42.11]Let me see here.
[206:42.75]Extreme, Iron Man, Last Mission, Custom Match.
[206:47.97]Oh, fuck it.
[206:48.39]Let's put, like, the shittiest characters in an 8-man fucking ladder match.
[206:51.33]Who gives a shit?
[206:53.05]This is gonna be impossible.
[206:55.49]Uh, who are the worst characters in the whole thing?
[206:58.14]Dr. Donna, Dr. Dan?
[207:02.74]And put Super Jax in it.
[207:03.98]Alright, Adam Sandler.
[207:08.78]Adam Sandler sans...
[207:17.34]The Hornet.
[207:22.68]95.
[207:26.68]Hold on, you.
[207:27.16]I can let Otto out here in a second.
[207:30.64]No, I refuse to put Quiet Man in here.
[207:32.60]He sucks.
[207:34.35]Let's put Fire Man.
[207:35.51]I just want to put Fire Man in the match because he's in 99.
[207:37.95]I believe he deserves it.
[207:46.51]The Hornet.
[207:49.29]Oh, he's already there.
[207:52.74]No, pinwheel sucks.
[207:55.98]Super blue screen of death.
[208:00.51]Hold on.
[208:01.45]Come on, let's go.
[208:25.27]And this will probably be the last one of the night.
[208:30.43]This is, uh, I'm going against the grain here.
[208:34.09]Usually I do the event and then that's it, but I've been having a lot of fun.
[208:39.10]Alright, so let's, uh, let's put the car valet in there.
[208:41.70]Deserves to be there.
[208:42.40]Let's get rid of the paybacks, though, because they're not fair.
[208:52.32]wall dad put in super jacks but that's gonna be so they're gonna win super jacks is gonna win alright we'll put wall dad in blue man alright glue man deserves to be there you're right and last one auto now willem defoe I agree
[209:18.92]Alright.
[209:19.90]Sandler, Hornet, Sands, Fireman, Baldi, Willem Dafoe, Carvel, Egg, Lumen, and an 8-man ladder match.
[209:24.28]Before it was 6-man.
[209:26.12]And I thought that was too much.
[209:27.36]So.
[209:31.39]Entrances, entrances off.
[209:35.29]They all, like, look, I didn't make entrances for people that weren't going to be in the, like, actual card.
[209:40.71]Let's go.
[209:43.95]Place your bets.
[209:45.33]On who's going to win the 8-fucking-man ladder match.
[209:51.62]I have Sandler.
[209:55.11]What a bunch of fucking dumbasses.
[209:59.25]Alright, good luck.
[210:00.75]Good luck to who?
[210:02.11]Wow, what a joke.
[210:04.51]This is an absolute joke.
[210:06.89]Nothing's gonna get done.
[210:10.71]Nothing's gonna get done.
[210:15.40]There's too many people.
[210:16.54]There's two ladders?
[210:18.48]What a reversal by Willem Dafoe.
[210:21.14]Car valet is already outside.
[210:22.35]Adam Sandler in the car valet.
[210:23.41]Alright, what time is it?
[210:27.21]It's 8.09 Pacific.
[210:29.43]I bet you this takes 30 minutes.
[210:32.51]Hope to God you guys like watching this.
[210:34.91]Because this is going to take an hour.
[210:44.08]Duel.
[210:45.53]Hornet and Wall Dad outside there.
[210:48.09]It's interesting because there's a pair for everything.
[210:51.33]2, 4, 6, 8.
[210:51.95]It's funny the pairs.
[210:55.05]Wall Dad and Wall Hornet are fighting.
[210:57.97]Which is weird.
[210:59.05]Kind of strange.
[211:01.81]Blue Man and Willem Dafoe.
[211:06.41]Wall Dad's really trying to get rid of those Hornets.
[211:10.90]Sandler and Carvalhe.
[211:17.56]Is this... Is this louder than it typically is?
[211:19.86]Why is it so loud?
[211:24.36]Sans and Fireman.
[211:27.40]The two... It's weird.
[211:28.26]The two fucking weird characters are fighting.
[211:31.69]The two human characters are fighting.
[211:34.03]And the two comic book characters are fighting.
[211:37.63]I... You saw me do it.
[211:39.37]I didn't fucking do it.
[211:40.49]Wall Dad, Wall Hornet.
[211:41.73]Two normal guys.
[211:43.29]Car Valet, Adam Sandler.
[211:44.51]Comic book characters.
[211:46.31]Blue Man, Willem Dafoe, and the two weirdos, Fireman and Sans.
[211:51.33]I didn't do that.
[211:53.23]It just did it itself.
[211:59.54]Baldad is like, I'm doing this.
[212:00.86]I'm doing this for my son.
[212:05.20]Fucking Minecon.
[212:08.02]Big clothesline there from Willem Dafoe on the car valet.
[212:13.53]Great commentary!
[212:18.87]Minecon.
[212:23.33]What's with the ring?
[212:24.21]Why is the... Holy shit!
[212:27.90]Wall Dad just absolutely annihilated the Hornet.
[212:32.52]Just punched him in the face so hard that he fell into the ladder.
[212:37.70]Blue Man now getting a couple of shots on Fire Man, who has rolled out to the outside.
[212:43.78]Wall dad with a wall knee.
[212:46.83]Glue Man is going up.
[212:47.61]He wants to win at least one competition.
[212:50.27]Right?
[212:51.71]You have to.
[212:52.47]Glue Man has to win a fucking competition.
[212:54.52]He's been around for like six years.
[212:57.84]Can he please win something?
[213:00.50]No, apparently not.
[213:04.93]Willem Dafoe puts a quick work of glue man while the two human characters are still fighting.
[213:14.24]Sandler and Carvalhe are still fighting each other.
[213:19.37]Adam Sandler is kicking his ass somehow.
[213:25.76]Why is Fireman just sitting there?
[213:29.02]Fireman does not understand what to do.
[213:30.72]I mean, he does have like four brain cells, so you really can't put that on him.
[213:35.83]He probably could have won the match right there, but he decided he's not going to do it.
[213:41.63]He'd rather throw Glue Man out and go after him rather than win the match.
[213:46.99]He could have just won.
[213:47.69]And now the Hornets going up there to try to win the game.
[213:50.28]Adam Sandler now is the only person in the ring that has any eyeballs.
[213:54.60]And he's not doing anything.
[213:55.86]He's going to go up the other side of the fucking ladder.
[213:58.48]Stops the Hornet potentially.
[214:00.98]Adam Sandler now has an opportunity.
[214:02.90]But Wall Dad coming in to take a fucking wall down.
[214:07.37]He's not strong enough.
[214:08.87]He's not strong enough.
[214:12.59]Come on with all your dad strength.
[214:14.87]Take the fucking wall down.
[214:17.64]There it is!
[214:20.46]He's from House Flipper, he's fucking strong!
[214:22.84]Oh my god.
[214:30.84]He did it!
[214:32.44]Wall Dad saves the day.
[214:38.13]And this is never gonna get done.
[214:42.57]Big... No, I thought it was going to be a powerbomb.
[214:44.51]Willem Dafoe on the ground.
[214:45.39]Now Sands going after Willem Dafoe in the back with the ladder.
[214:49.35]And now on the stomach.
[214:50.37]Hornet is taking a break.
[214:52.35]While Glue Man has like three dead bodies in front of him.
[214:56.79]Adam Sandler is unconscious sitting up.
[215:00.53]No, he seems to be coming too.
[215:03.18]Sands Undertale, or should I say Deltarune, going up to the top of the fucking top rope to get the briefcase.
[215:08.66]Willem Dafoe is the only one that can see.
[215:10.64]Wall dead!
[215:12.03]Get the fuck out of here.
[215:13.93]I'm the only one that stops this.
[215:15.19]No, he doesn't care.
[215:15.87]Willing to fall.
[215:16.43]No.
[215:21.49]Come on, Wall Dad.
[215:22.47]Take another wall down.
[215:26.91]Wall Dad again showing his brute House Flipper strength.
[215:36.95]Ball Dad receiving a lot of punishment for his saving the match.
[215:41.15]Car Valet.
[215:43.11]Is that a car?
[215:45.79]DeClaire.
[215:46.79]He's going up to the top to get the briefcase.
[215:49.54]Can Car Valet end this right now and cause a conniption?
[215:56.30]No.
[215:56.66]Hornet's going up top.
[215:59.70]The conniption is over.
[216:02.98]Is it though?

[221:18.68]What a bunch of bums.
[221:21.43]Lou is a hundred.
[221:23.59]As he should be.
[221:25.91]Oh, it's actually a tag match.
[221:27.45]Walldad is in there first, so it's not Tornado Tag.
[221:33.27]Snickers?
[221:35.68]Oh, yeah, there's like Snickers logos in the game.
[221:41.34]Oh, with the elbow drop there for Wall Dad.
[221:43.98]He's got that knee brace on.
[221:45.00]He's got a bad knee.
[221:50.21]Please beat him right now, Wall Dad.
[221:53.47]Oh, well.
[221:55.41]Super Chex versus Snickers.
[221:57.59]I'm not making... That's it.
[221:59.36]Game's over.
[222:04.25]Wall Dead somehow is destroying Jax.
[222:07.25]No, Super Jax with the overhead throw there.
[222:15.69]Super Wall versus Super Jax.
[222:17.38]That's right.
[222:19.48]Dragging him to the middle of the ring.
[222:21.30]Super Jax is going to grab his arm.
[222:24.10]What's he doing here?
[222:24.86]Oh, of course.
[222:26.12]The secret fucking technique.
[222:29.62]Doesn't matter how strong you are, that always works.
[222:33.25]He's got Wall Dad in as submission here.
[222:38.16]Hopefully we get a tag in.
[222:40.18]Otherwise Wall Dad looks like he could be... No!
[222:41.94]What a knee to the face of Super Jex.
[222:44.80]Two Infinity Gauntlets is not enough for a Minecon 2013 gift bag with two stickers and a diamond pickaxe plastic toy.
[222:54.60]It's not enough!
[223:01.42]He's got Dad Instinct.
[223:05.89]Nice.
[223:06.45]What a just charging dash.
[223:08.59]And here comes Jerma Raptor.
[223:11.23]The worst person you could have tagged in.
[223:12.51]You should have tagged in in the loop.
[223:14.85]Jerma Raptor now is going to get instantly powerbombed.
[223:22.03]Okay.
[223:22.75]Good work.
[223:24.09]Good work.
[223:25.22]Shittiest thing ever.
[223:28.14]He's just beating the shit out of his head.
[223:30.98]He's already done.
[223:31.66]He's dead.
[223:32.96]Game over.
[223:36.29]Come on, do like a Raptor move.
[223:43.42]Fuck you, Super Jax.
[223:44.44]You get two Infinity Gauntlets.
[223:45.78]I get a mask from Walmart.
[223:49.60]This is embarrassing again.
[223:52.32]Get Lou Elbertson in there.
[223:53.63]He at least has a chance.
[224:00.05]Dermaraptor is about to go extinct.
[224:03.22]Just stepping on his head.
[224:04.36]Going to the top rope.
[224:05.30]Somebody get in there, please.
[224:11.97]Oh, he missed with a stomp.
[224:14.15]This is Jerma Raptor's chance.
[224:15.93]Into the corner.
[224:17.75]Tag him in.
[224:18.27]Let's get a double team here.
[224:20.65]There we go.
[224:21.37]Beautiful.

[224:26.13]Whatever that means.
[224:28.02]Team work.
[224:32.58]Waldad now going to the corner.
[224:33.84]SuperJex now.
[224:34.73]Why would you tag it?
[224:35.57]Waldad is so tired.
[224:38.29]Oh dear.
[224:39.29]That's not good.
[224:39.99]We got a one.
[224:40.97]We've got... No, only one.
[224:42.81]Only one.
[224:45.71]Trying to... You got nobody to tag in, Wal.
[224:55.42]Jermog... What the fuck is this?
[225:01.57]Oh, no.
[225:02.69]He just put his legs in the air and put them up and down.
[225:06.79]Some super jacks.
[225:07.75]Throw them outside.
[225:09.17]Let's get Lou in here.
[225:10.17]Wall dad going to Lou, maybe.
[225:11.49]No.
[225:13.70]Tagging back in Jerma Raptor.
[225:16.94]What is this?
[225:19.78]Jerma Raptor didn't do anything.
[225:22.34]He pretended like he helped.
[225:24.10]All he did was jump off the ropes.
[225:25.18]That's it.

[226:06.33]JermaRaptor has Jex in the corner.
[226:09.39]You could have guessed that was going to happen.
[226:11.95]Big crashing downward spiral into the mat there.
[226:15.19]JermaRaptor is in a lot of trouble in the corner.
[226:19.21]SuperJex is on the top rope again.
[226:21.07]The same flipping scoop powerbomb thing.
[226:24.03]And Walldack can't handle it.
[226:25.96]Walldack's like, this is bullshit.
[226:27.20]He's got 100 stats.
[226:28.18]It's not fair.
[226:32.54]Wall dad coming out of the walls.
[226:34.88]Behind the wall, you could say.
[226:36.20]Look at this dad instinct.
[226:39.98]Save the day.
[226:41.88]Oh, jermaJex.
[226:42.90]SuperJex is going for the next snap.
[226:45.04]Will he get it?
[226:46.78]No, he will not.
[226:50.83]He's powering up here.
[226:51.75]The two Infinity Gauntlets.
[226:53.73]He's got the Mind Stone and the Power Stone.
[226:55.43]He can control all of reality.
[226:57.65]And that's all it took was one, two punches.
[227:01.23]and a belly-to-back suplex on his neck.
[227:05.39]They're both reaching out desperately to get a tag from JervaRaptor.
[227:08.99]They know he's the shittiest character in this entire Rumble.
[227:13.49]No, JervaRaptor, no.
[227:15.23]Nobody cares.
[227:16.37]It's not cool.
[227:17.89]Tag out.
[227:19.01]You have to tag out now.
[227:24.26]Before you keep embarrassing yourself.
[227:26.62]Tag Lu in.
[227:28.50]Tag out.
[227:30.49]No, stop proving yourself.
[227:33.05]This is the worst joke you've ever made.
[227:35.19]Stop trying to prove it.
[227:36.23]It's worth doing.
[227:38.19]See?
[227:38.63]Look what happened.
[227:40.49]He's like, no, no, I can make it funny.
[227:41.61]I'll go.
[227:43.14]No, it's not funny.
[227:44.28]It's not going to happen.
[227:44.94]It's not going to be funny.
[228:09.50]Sherma gets out of the top rope.
[228:10.72]What a reversal there by Sherma Raptor.
[228:13.80]All the shit we just talked.
[228:16.04]But he, oh boy, he got hit right in the skull.
[228:20.99]You don't stand a chance against Super Jax.
[228:22.77]Use your teammates.
[228:23.63]Use your friends and your family members.
[228:25.31]There's one right next to you with 100 stats.
[228:27.03]Stop staring at him.
[228:31.95]He scoops him up.
[228:32.89]How can he pick him up?
[228:33.72]He's like a thousand pounds.
[228:35.70]Holy shit.
[228:37.96]Holy shit.
[228:40.24]He's got a lot to prove.
[228:41.72]Dragging him to the middle of the ring.
[228:58.23]And he's going for the pin!
[228:59.69]Can we get a... One!
[229:01.86]Two!
[229:02.60]Oh, a two count.
[229:03.42]Oh, unbelievable.
[229:04.28]I can't believe he got out of that one.
[229:06.26]JermaRaptor had a chance there.
[229:08.32]A small chance.
[229:09.22]Oh, what a lariat with the leg.
[229:10.90]A leg lariat, as you would say.
[229:13.24]My Super Jax.
[229:17.49]There it is.
[229:18.85]There it is.
[229:19.53]The Spindiddle.
[229:21.07]I've said that word like 30 times already.
[229:23.47]It's tagging.
[229:25.23]Wall dance coming in.
[229:28.58]Lou is essentially a manager right now.
[229:30.46]And the Super Jax is like, fuck this.
[229:31.86]I'll see you next time on the next episode.
[229:34.00]And it's the next episode.

[229:46.92]He got him on the back!
[229:48.46]Backwards elbow by Walldad.
[229:52.41]Scoops him up with a choke slam.
[229:54.03]Could that be it?
[229:55.15]That's one!
[229:56.91]That's two!
[229:58.33]Can he get the third one?
[230:00.19]He got the third one!
[230:01.87]Can Walldad close this one out?
[230:03.53]Can it be the end of the situation here for SuperJex?
[230:07.51]Can we get to the end of the season already?
[230:11.02]Into the corner he goes.
[230:12.90]Walldad.

[230:59.86]Here comes the pin!
[231:02.20]One!
[231:03.54]Oh, only one.
[231:04.48]I wonder why.
[231:06.02]I wonder why that happened.
[231:09.26]Maybe if you pinned him after doing the move, it might not have happened.
[231:14.82]As Walldad goes into the corner, we've got a... Oh, he did the diaper.
[231:19.88]That's a super diaper.
[231:22.25]Superject with a super diaper on his super fucking face.

[237:29.04]Maybe.
[237:29.30]I don't know.
[237:30.20]He gets her!
[237:31.11]Right hand!
[237:32.11]Lou Elbertson!
[237:33.99]And that's called the Thanksgiving turkey chicken dinner!
[237:37.11]Didn't even get a chance.
[237:42.92]Oh, he threw his hand into the ground.
[237:44.82]Unbelievable.
[237:45.58]Going for the neck break.
[237:48.70]Can somebody finally get the neck break to end a match?
[237:53.49]Nope.
[237:56.29]Let's go for it again.
[237:57.15]No, he gets reversed and a close line by Super Jackson to Lou Elbertson.
[238:01.96]Elbertson.
[238:04.97]Trying to take his head clean off of his shoulders.
[238:07.95]Did not seem to work in this scenario.
[238:09.59]Now we've got... Oh, he's dragging him around like fucking dirty underwear on the ground.
[238:14.69]He's kind of by the neck.
[238:15.57]That's a very bad position to be in.
[238:18.31]Is he going to break Lou's neck?
[238:20.57]No, Lou reversed it somehow.
[238:23.39]Ooh, took a slap into his face.
[238:25.73]Oh, my face.
[238:27.39]Now he's got a backwards suplex into the diaper.
[238:30.11]The diaper 2.0.
[238:38.09]Why would you... Alright.
[238:39.69]One!
[238:40.61]Not even a one count on Lou Elbertson.
[238:47.13]Why is every move the diaper?
[238:49.25]That's the diaper 2.0.
[238:50.49]The diaper 1 is the double... The feet jump into the ground.
[238:54.08]He jumps in the air and kicks you.
[238:55.92]Diaper 1, diaper 2.
[238:59.16]Just taunting Lou Elbertson here.
[239:02.74]As Lew does not look good.
[239:04.64]He's got great stats, but he can't go up against the Infinity Gauntlet.
[239:08.10]He throws him outside.
[239:09.20]He doesn't give a fuck.
[239:11.74]He's going to wait.
[239:12.62]Is he going to go up top?
[239:14.26]He's like, I like this one better.
[239:15.70]He's up top.
[239:16.64]Is Jermaraptor going to cause a problem here for him?
[239:18.64]No, I would go back to this one.
[239:21.28]No, no.
[239:22.46]I think I'm going to do this one.
[239:24.98]Let me try this one.
[239:26.68]No.
[239:27.14]Top left is better.
[239:30.52]I think I'll just go out there.
[239:32.26]My brain is fucking addled Swiss cheese.
[239:37.98]And there he goes.
[239:38.78]Lou Elbertson goes down.
[239:40.30]Now we got two count.
[239:41.79]20 count means the end of the match.
[239:44.25]Nice reversal into the balls.
[239:46.71]Will it be enough to stop Super Jax?
[239:49.55]I don't think so.
[239:50.29]Is he going to throw him into the crowd?
[239:55.02]No.
[239:55.36]Just into the banister here.
[239:56.36]Five seconds have elapsed.
[240:01.20]Right hand, left hand, right hand.
[240:03.31]This is bad.
[240:04.35]This is really bad.
[240:05.21]Oh, come on.
[240:10.17]A count-out is literally the worst thing you could ever do.
[240:13.36]Why is the ref not counting?
[240:14.98]That was the longest eight seconds I've ever seen in the history of the Jerma Arena.
[240:19.56]And there goes Jerma... jermaJex is in the ring.
[240:24.43]The...
[240:41.18]Oh, make sure you show Lou clapping though, that's great.
[243:40.15]He doesn't need to be maxed.
[243:42.78]He doesn't need that.
[244:14.10]Here's a wall dad and here's a wall chat.
[244:18.06]2.0 What's the difference?
[244:24.75]You have a glowing hat.
[244:26.29]Let's go.
[244:43.67]You can't beat Minecon 2013.
[244:46.35]TLC match.
[244:47.81]Wall Chad 2.0 versus Super Jax.
[244:53.55]Wall dead.
[244:58.22]The only thing that needs to glow is his helmet.
[245:01.64]Look, you can't even fucking do anything versus Minecon.
[245:05.88]Remember when they announced sheep?
[245:07.80]They're like wolves.
[245:10.34]He was there for that.
[245:12.73]He stood in line.
[245:13.63]He was there for that, don't you understand?
[245:16.31]Let's get some tables in here.
[245:17.37]Do a mega version rumble?
[245:19.11]That would take so long.
[245:41.17]Hey, uh, I mean, like, I know, hey, I just want to say that, you know, little, uh, little Jason is, like, such a huge fan of your channel.
[245:49.88]He really loved when you played, um, the Hunger Games.
[245:54.66]Do you mind if I get, like, a picture with you?
[245:56.56]Which is, well, him, not me.
[245:58.46]Thanks, man.
[246:10.33]Minecraft Hunger Games.
[246:13.27]I'm not going to play Minecraft music.
[246:15.48]This is probably the last match of the night.
[246:25.52]Fucking my... No.
[246:27.04]What the hell just happened?
[246:30.80]That was the equivalent of two planets colliding and now they're outside under the tables.
[246:34.52]The commentators are getting up.
[246:38.49]We got a table from SuperJex, but Walchad 2.0 is gonna stop that from happening.
[246:45.08]They're bigger than the tables.
[246:51.22]Uh-oh.
[246:53.04]Where is SuperJex going?
[246:55.65]Possibly to the ladder, it seems.
[246:58.09]Yep, you gotta get that.
[246:58.93]You gotta get the money up top.
[247:01.07]You gotta get your free two tickets to MineCon.
[247:07.21]And Wall Dad is getting a table.
[247:13.77]There's the ladder set up.
[247:15.31]Nice dodge by Super Jex.
[247:17.53]Wall Chad can't seem to get right into the table.
[247:22.35]Now that is devastating.
[247:26.74]Super Jex is going to the outside for some reason.
[247:29.96]I'm not sure why.
[247:30.66]Yeah, Wall Dad brought out his own wall.
[247:35.30]And...
[247:38.61]While that is... Going and getting the briefcase.
[247:44.95]SuperJex is... An observer.
[247:51.00]And... He's fiddling with the... The hook there.
[247:59.52]And... Trying to get it.
[248:02.40]It's a tough hook.
[248:04.50]Almost got it.
[248:04.98]No, he kind of fucked it up there.
[248:06.16]He's going to try to get him.
[248:09.78]It's a tough lock.
[248:12.34]Might take four, two sets of hands there.
[248:14.64]Oh, he's got a... There it is.
[248:33.85]Yeah, this is where my son... Yeah, I can't believe it.
[248:40.44]This is signed by all the YouTubers!
[249:08.95]Well.
[249:21.06]That's it.
[249:31.85]I don't know what the hell that was.
[249:41.75]That was fun.
[249:44.27]Well, the first, like, hour and a half of the stream was, like, the real shit, and then the last, like, three hours was bullshit.
[249:51.91]But it was fun.
[249:54.40]Uh, thank you so much, everybody, for coming.
[249:58.18]There were a lot... I... There was so many people here tonight.
[250:01.06]I can't even believe it.
[250:02.30]There was almost 10,000 people at the stream concurrently.
[250:05.68]That's fucking out of control.
[250:08.40]So, thank you for participating.
[250:10.54]Thanks for being part of the community.
[250:13.22]Because a lot of these random characters are, you know, at least half of them, more than half of them, because we thought they were fun and funny, you know what I mean?
[250:25.89]So, thank you for participating, everybody.
[250:29.59]It's always a blast.
[250:32.83]Good night.
[250:34.44]Take care of yourself.
[250:35.38]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[250:38.08]I'm gonna take tomorrow off, because I really, the last four days straight, I've kind of just been making characters.
[250:45.71]So, I'm gonna take tomorrow off.
[250:47.03]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[250:48.03]We'll probably... You know, I have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do on Tuesday.
[250:52.21]That's a good question.
[250:57.07]But, if you're new, thanks for dropping by.
[251:01.13]If not, then... Hey, good to see you again.
[251:03.29]We're probably going to have fucked up credits because of the... I had Streamlabs turned off.
[251:11.78]Just for the sake of... Because I wanted to have no notifications on the stream.
[251:16.12]So... This might be difficult to do this.
[251:19.45]Let's see.
[251:19.87]I think it's still here, but...
[251:30.43]Try Soul Calibur.
[251:31.71]Here's the thing about Soul Calibur.
[251:33.95]It's got a really great character creator, but I would get to the game, the actual... We'd make like five characters in Soul Calibur, and then I'd get to the video game and go, I don't know about this.
[251:51.63]See you guys on Tuesday if you're taking off.
[251:53.09]Thanks for sticking around.
[251:54.07]Let me see if I can pull up the...
[251:58.38]Might be tough to pull up the... at least the bits.
[252:01.42]Let's see.
[252:07.10]Soulcalibur is great.
[252:11.75]It's for PC, right?
[252:14.79]Soulcalibur is PC?
[252:17.93]But we do this once like every eight or nine months.
[252:21.13]Once there's enough characters or new ideas to put into a rumble.
[252:25.86]So thank you so much everybody for sticking around.
[252:31.57]I don't have any of the subs, I don't think.
[252:33.24]Let me see.
[252:35.74]I'll run the credits either way, because I didn't have Streamlabs going, but it's okay.
[252:42.42]No, actually, how the fuck did I delete it?
[252:44.08]What the hell am I doing?
[252:49.75]People gave so much money tonight.
[252:50.97]There was at least $50 from Ney.
[252:53.53]From NeyMeansNey.
[252:54.45]Thanks for $50.
[252:56.36]Streams the best birthday present ever.
[252:58.16]Thank you so much.
[253:00.22]$10 from RiggleRat.
[253:01.66]They said, Jack's God.
[253:03.00]$10 from Elizabeth.
[253:04.42]I love your stuff so much.
[253:05.30]Please take these bits.
[253:06.82]Thank you.
[253:10.86]Um... OBS!
[253:14.44]Make sure you get OBS Studio.
[253:19.89]Thank you, guys.
[253:22.51]OBS hijack.
[253:24.97]On Tuesday, we'll be live again.
[253:30.07]Peaked at 9,000 viewers this stream.
[253:32.04]Holy shit.
[253:33.56]Are you kidding me?
[253:38.96]I saw like eight.
[253:40.68]God damn.
[253:42.78]Thank you, everybody.
[253:44.46]Hope you had fun. 9,085.
[253:48.99]Really?
[253:49.49]Are you serious?
[253:51.21]9,085.
[253:53.01]Jesus Christ.
[253:57.63]Well, that's a lot of new people.
[253:59.49]If you're new, hopefully I'll see you again.
[254:01.50]We try to do fun stuff like this on a monthly basis.
[254:06.24]Top WWE streamer.
[254:13.47]But, I think I'm going to end it here.
[254:17.95]I've gotta go take care of Otto.
[254:19.97]He ran downstairs and I gotta go let him out and feed him and shit.
[254:22.47]I gotta go.
[254:28.40]You guys are fucking incredible.
[254:29.42]Thank you everybody for subscribing, for giving money.
[254:36.00]Thank you so much.
[254:39.28]And I'll see you next weekend.
[254:40.72]There's even more.
[254:41.60]We're not fucking stopping.
[254:42.68]The brakes don't... We don't fucking hit the brakes anymore.
[254:45.89]Next weekend...
[254:48.46]is the movie night for the green screen.
[254:51.46]That's gonna be a fucking ton of fun.
[254:54.53]I've seen some of the shit you guys have made so far and it's hilarious.
[255:00.09]So, that's next weekend.
[255:01.28]Every fucking weekend we're doing something new.
[255:05.47]Again, if you don't know, in the Discord, there is a channel called Movie Night.
[255:11.99]There's a pinned message.
[255:13.74]The video has to be uploaded to YouTube.
[255:16.18]You can't just put it on like Reddit or something.
[255:17.70]It's got to be a YouTube video.
[255:18.64]It's going to go in a YouTube playlist.
[255:24.02]It has to be there by next Thursday, 29th, Thursday or Friday.
[255:30.19]Join the Discord.
[255:30.83]A lot of great people there.
[255:34.52]And that's where I'm gonna end it.
[255:35.74]So... I have my stream.
[255:38.28]Unfortunately, I'm sorry I can't do the subs tonight.
[255:43.47]And I gotta go take care of the dog, so... All your subscriptions, all the money you guys gave the stream is fucking incredibly appreciated.
[255:50.49]I can't believe people paid money to this stream.
[255:53.01]But that's why I wanna do stuff that's fun, or at least I try.
[255:58.04]If I'm having fun, hope you guys are too.
[256:02.03]Cheers.
[256:03.11]Much love to you.
[256:03.65]See you guys on Tuesday.
[256:06.21]Take care of yourselves.
[256:08.86]Ta-ta for now.
[256:34.54]Thank you.
