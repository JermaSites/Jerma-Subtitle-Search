[00:01.19]Hello.
[00:03.93]How are you?
[00:04.73]How you doing?
[00:09.64]It's good to be back.
[00:12.10]You haven't heard my voice in like two months.
[00:17.10]Well, except that maybe three or four times I popped in and said, look at me.
[00:22.10]During the rerun streams, which, oh yeah, I did plenty of those.
[00:25.98]I did two of them.
[00:28.01]And then they never happened again.
[00:33.05]All these community subs.
[00:35.05]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:39.28]I'm hitting the community sub lottery right now.
[00:43.16]There's so many.
[00:44.12]I can't eat this.
[00:45.20]Thank you for the like 200 community subs right off the bat.
[00:48.02]Like 30 of you.
[00:51.42]Oh my God.
[00:54.31]Yeah, I'm here.
[00:54.99]I'm back.
[00:56.73]We are not going to start streaming yet.
[01:00.97]We got a lot to talk about first.
[01:04.26]We are not ready to just go into the stream.
[01:07.33]There are some things.
[01:12.33]Oh, I'm already seeing the MonkaS's.
[01:14.51]Well, you should be MonkaSing because we got some changes that are going to be made.
[01:21.48]As of today, I'm here.
[01:24.24]I will be here.
[01:26.32]Oh, MonkaS.
[01:27.36]It feels so good to do that.
[01:29.12]I haven't done that in a long time.
[01:35.62]So many of these.
[01:37.70]Yeah, no, we got a lot to talk about.
[01:39.16]I'm not just going to get right into it.
[01:41.04]I'm going to get right into talking about things, though.
[01:45.00]But very importantly, though, before we really get started, I've got to talk about steakums.
[01:50.46]They sure are the most delicious thing I've ever had in my life.
[01:54.98]You can make a sandwich out of 100% pure whole wheat beef.
[02:02.12]This is how I like to do it.
[02:04.60]I like to fold it over.
[02:06.92]But... Alright, it looks like dog food.
[02:12.85]Alright?
[02:13.47]It looks like dog food.
[02:15.41]But it doesn't taste like... I promise you, it doesn't taste like dog food.
[02:19.21]It tastes like 100% whole grain beef.
[02:25.91]Mm-hmm.
[02:28.57]July 30th, you promised, number one!
[02:30.49]Pimped!
[02:39.57]Hopefully.
[02:40.03]Did I just spit all of you?
[02:41.42]I hope not.
[02:44.14]And you got a haircut!
[02:46.12]A little... Yeah, I did.
[02:51.08]Can you see?
[02:51.46]See, I'm fine!
[02:56.66]Everybody thought I may have been, like, being, like, decrepifying.
[03:00.71]No, I'm fine.
[03:02.81]Well... Well...
[03:06.25]Not really.
[03:07.97]Ah, that's what we're going to talk about today.
[03:11.39]Well, you know.
[03:16.39]So, the first thing we're going to... I would eat this whole thing right now, but it's been sitting here for about like 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[03:29.67]It's kind of cold.
[03:31.03]That doesn't mean that it's not delicious.
[03:41.79]Where's my camera?
[03:43.25]Is this fucking... There can't be... Is this 10,000 people here right now?
[03:48.35]What the fuck is happening?
[03:52.95]Why are there over 10,000 people here?
[03:55.75]There's 12,000 people here.
[04:03.66]I... Hey!
[04:04.28]Remember me?
[04:07.32]Your favorite streamer.
[04:11.76]fuck now I'm like on the spot shit I thought there was gonna be like I thought there's gonna be like 1600 people left ah hey um welcome to the channel everybody no no I'll get real it's time to get real stake him's brand stay comes this is not an ad oh hey doesn't this look like an ad something about the steak comes packaging this it just looks like an advertisement
[04:43.39]Like, if this was just sitting back here, that's an ad, right?
[04:46.41]In the freezer, this is an ad.
[04:53.26]Oh, by the way, can we just quickly look at the back of this?
[05:00.24]What's that say?
[05:01.90]Hey, can somebody read me one of the ingredients, please?
[05:05.22]What's the ingredient?
[05:06.62]What is that?
[05:07.04]What's it say?
[05:09.16]Wait, it doesn't say 100.
[05:09.82]It just says beef.

[05:40.94]Oh, he's stalling.
[05:41.76]He's stalling.
[05:42.48]Alright, I'll get to the real bullshit.
[05:44.38]I'll get to the real shit.
[05:45.28]I'm going to get to the... Let's get to the real shit, okay?
[05:47.79]Fuck, I haven't streamed for two months.
[05:53.45]Alright, so anyways.
[05:54.25]If you don't know, there are 13,000 people here now.
[05:59.99]This is the most people I've had on my stream in like fucking a year.
[06:03.74]Okay, so I took a leave of absence.
[06:07.56]I was gone for about two and a half months for the sole reason to try to help let me focus and diagnose an issue I was having.
[06:14.14]I have back pain and chest pain that seems to be coming from a mystery source.
[06:20.07]And I can announce to you right here today
[06:23.66]That I still don't know what's wrong with me.
[06:26.15]I am currently on painkillers.
[06:28.49]Not, no, no, I'm not on narcotics.
[06:31.41]I'm on non-narcotic painkillers.
[06:34.03]And I had two injections in my ass.
[06:37.49]At the same time.
[06:39.68]One on either side.
[06:42.50]And... Okay.
[06:43.90]Yeah, on my hips.
[06:47.16]I'll say hip.
[06:48.44]I had two injections in my ass.
[06:52.25]And they're supposed to keep me going.
[06:55.10]Painkillers, I don't want to get to a point where I'm taking these every day for the rest of my life.
[07:00.78]But, while I'm on these, I'm going to just continue to stream.
[07:06.61]I'm not going to disappear for another three or four months.
[07:09.03]I really didn't want to have it go more than two or three months.
[07:12.71]I want to stream.
[07:13.45]I want to be here.
[07:15.56]I've got God Hand to play, goddammit.
[07:17.10]One of my promises that I have to keep today.
[07:20.36]Oh, by the way, there is a promise on here.
[07:23.54]We'll get to it.
[07:24.32]I'm just not doing it.
[07:30.01]A lot of people are saying, take care of yourself.
[07:33.27]We waited.
[07:34.31]We'll wait more.
[07:35.01]I appreciate that.
[07:37.43]But I don't want to wait anymore.
[07:40.13]There's so many things that I want to do, so many things that I have planned.
[07:43.47]I don't want to just not be away anymore.
[07:47.63]So what's going to happen here is because I'm still in the process of figuring this out, that doesn't stop.
[07:54.66]So we're going back to the pre-Vegas stream schedule.
[07:59.16]I'm going to be streaming three days a week.
[08:01.72]That will let me have time to be able to continue to focus on this, but still stream and still be here, right?
[08:08.27]secondly and this is the biggest change of all and this is something that a lot of people are probably going to be sad to hear this but it's necessary and it's something that I have to do and I'm going to say it just right now we're going to rip the band-aid off the end of the stream wind down is going away I am no longer reading bits on the channel it's gone as of today
[08:32.39]And the reason why I have to do this is because if I can only stream a few times a week and I know that my streams are only going to be about four to six hours,
[08:44.38]I want to be able to have as much time as possible doing whatever it is I'm doing.
[08:50.09]And those of you that have been here for a long time, you know that if a stream was four, five, six, seven hours, that actually meant the stream was about eight or nine hours because of the time after the stream, right?
[09:01.77]The post-stream wind down.
[09:04.01]So it's going away.
[09:05.77]And it allows me to sit here if I'm still comfortable and not have to focus on, hey, it's been like four or five hours, I'm okay, but I know I got about an hour or two after the stream maybe to do the bit readings.
[09:20.85]So that was a hard decision to come to because I don't... I know a lot of people like that, and I like that too.
[09:29.71]But what will replace it
[09:32.42]And when I say replace, I mean like not, it's not going to happen all the time.
[09:35.46]It'll happen very, very sparingly is I'll start doing them in the middle of streams.
[09:41.12]If there's a game or if there's a comb stream or we're just hanging out or something, and I'm able to be able to kind of split my attention, I'll just do it in the middle of streams.
[09:52.56]No TTS.
[09:53.34]I'm not doing that.
[09:54.02]I will never turn that on for any reason.
[09:58.33]So that will happen.
[10:00.17]It's not going to happen all the time though.
[10:01.75]That's going to happen once in a blue moon.
[10:06.13]So TL;DR before we really get started.
[10:10.90]My problem still persists.
[10:12.70]I'm on pain medication.
[10:14.48]So I'll be, I'm alright.
[10:16.46]But I got to still figure out what the hell is wrong with me.
[10:19.77]We've ruled out a shitload of really scary things.
[10:23.31]So now we move forward into trying to figure out what the hell this actually really is.
[10:29.05]Thanks for the gold, kind streamer.
[10:31.15]You're welcome.
[10:33.52]Although I didn't give you anything.
[10:37.12]At least the bad shit is ruled out.
[10:39.98]Yes.
[10:41.60]And we are continuing to do that because at this point when you get to a scenario where this is just such a strange problem that I'm having, all I'm doing at this point is ruling out bad things until somebody goes, oh, I think we got it.
[11:00.83]There are 15,000 people here.
[11:02.97]Holy shit.
[11:07.81]Alright.
[11:08.57]Are you guys ready?
[11:10.31]Are you guys ready?
[11:15.53]What's the first thing I'm going to say on stream?
[11:19.00]What should the first thing be?
[11:22.74]Hold on.
[11:23.12]I got to reheat these steak.
[11:27.56]How the hell?
[11:28.04]Okay, let's do 25 minutes.
[11:30.68]What happens if... Okay.
[11:33.40]No, I don't even want to say that.
[11:36.14]Did the Mythbusters ever do this?
[11:37.64]Like, did you ever microwave a ham sandwich for 30 minutes?
[11:40.34]What happens?
[11:41.28]I'm not going to do it.
[11:41.80]Don't do that.
[11:42.92]Did the Mythbusters do this?
[11:44.92]Did the Mythbusters ever turn a microwave on for a long time?
[11:47.54]What happens?
[11:53.00]Oh, shit.
[11:53.72]Okay.
[11:54.69]Dude, I've got so many stories locked up here.

[12:40.34]I'm going to get to the first time that somebody says, and then I'm going to turn it off.

[16:55.75]Alright, if I fail this, I have to eat a steak and shoot.
[17:03.22]I am hearing them.
[17:17.92]I haven't played No More Heroes in a really long time.
[17:22.33]Do you remember my last stream was... My last stream was like three months ago.
[17:28.19]Before that, when was No More Heroes 2?
[17:31.37]Like, fucking four months ago?
[17:34.25]You suck, LOL.
[17:34.97]Yeah, well, whatever.
[17:36.29]I don't remember the fucking move.
[17:45.14]I got a minute and 30.
[17:45.96]I'll be fine.
[17:52.20]Why do I care so much about proving to you guys this is real when it very obviously isn't?
[17:58.06]Why is it still in my head?
[17:59.18]Like, somebody's gonna think I'm fucking lying.
[18:00.48]I don't even care.
[18:01.70]Do I really care that much about that?
[18:04.80]Dave is still alive.
[18:13.78]Well, it's alright.
[18:14.30]It's only gonna be on the screen for, like, another minute and four seconds.
[18:22.89]Why is he playing this?
[18:36.88]There it is.
[18:45.68]Promise done.
[18:47.82]That was Revenge Mission 7 with the Rose Nasty.
[18:51.00]Unhard.
[18:51.50]Maybe.
[18:55.46]Alright, how we doing on, uh... How we doing on, um... You know what I'm saying.
[19:04.01]God Hand!
[19:07.25]Uh, wait.
[19:11.99]Oh, I gotta delete this.
[19:20.51]I'm switching between my sources, guys.
[19:26.03]Alright, I'm ready.
[19:26.77]Alright, I just freaked out for a second because... Hold on a second.
[19:36.01]You gotta see this.
[19:41.06]So I got this... High capacity PlayStation 3, right?
[19:47.30]And yeah, I may have like... I may have torn it open.
[19:53.43]I needed that.
[19:54.23]Alright, I have to hold this together.
[20:00.61]Whatever.
[20:00.99]Okay, here we go.
[20:05.68]Make sure you guys recycle, okay?
[20:07.46]Mass Effect?
[20:12.63]Okay, so this is, you want to know just how much of a fucking idiot I really am?
[20:16.89]So I bought a PlayStation 3 because I needed one for God Hand, obviously, and I used to have one, but I got rid of it, right?
[20:22.55]So I get this, and I don't know why I thought this, but I did.
[20:30.05]This says, as you see, okay, like, includes, right?
[20:33.65]Like, includes all this stuff, okay?
[20:36.11]Like, oh, look, it includes.
[20:37.99]What does it include, that is?
[20:39.75]I thought there was 2,500 games and 190 fucking movies on this thing.
[20:45.23]I was like, what?
[20:47.11]Hold on.
[20:48.67]Like, why is it preloaded with 73,000 songs?
[20:53.50]Is one of these, like, fucking hack boxes?
[20:55.02]I was like, there's 2,500 games.
[20:57.46]Oh, yeah, right.
[21:00.43]I forgot about that I forgot that PlayStation 3 was back in the age when space was a really big deal and talking about that you could have like 67 million mp3 files on your hard drive was a huge deal not in 2020 you could have over 66 trillion jpegs it's like wow that's a lot
[21:35.14]Oh, that's why you're saying Mass Effect.
[21:37.98]Why is it telling me to download God Hand again?
[21:39.78]I don't want you to see that.
[21:45.40]That's a spoiler.
[21:48.46]Get out of here.
[21:52.70]Why am I... I don't have to download God Hand again.
[21:54.70]I just did.
[21:55.14]I just installed.
[21:55.98]Hey, it's a good thing I could put 2,500 God Hands on here.
[22:04.91]Okay, now I have to actually make the audio different.
[22:13.56]Is it the updater?
[22:14.32]No, no, no.
[22:14.98]I'll be ready in a second here.
[22:15.90]You hear that?
[22:18.75]okay god yeah alright here we go it's time I've been promising one here's the thing there are 15 000 of you here right now okay I have been promising one person for the last probably year and a half that I was going to play this game oh please there is a signal is there and it was me warning you have it okay okay let me do this too
[22:50.68]God, it feels good to be playing games in front of an audience.
[23:02.84]Oh, my God.
[23:04.23]Clover.
[23:05.71]Wow, now that's loud.
[23:11.19]This game contains scenes of violence.
[23:13.39]Oh, my God.
[23:13.97]There's so many community subs.
[23:15.79]So much money has come in.
[23:17.83]And I'm... I...
[23:21.06]Freddy Dredd just gave a fucking 100 community subs, like, Jesus, man.
[23:27.04]Oh, wait, hold on, I gotta turn off, uh, the Wii thing.
[23:31.32]No!
[23:32.42]No, did I just turn- I think I just closed all windows on my computer.
[23:34.96]Did I do that?
[23:38.70]Why is that even an option?
[23:41.52]No!
[23:43.09]Close all- no, no, no, okay, we're good, we're good.
[23:44.95]Are we good?
[23:46.67]I don't fucking- am I still alive?
[23:49.97]I think so.
[23:50.65]Just don't touch me then.
[23:57.53]I like this music, though.
[23:59.46]Ah, shit.
[23:59.84]Did I already make a joke about this music?
[24:01.20]Like, two years ago?
[24:03.84]They said it was beach music?
[24:06.10]This is another hundred fucking subs from Freddy.
[24:09.78]Why can't I press start?
[24:11.10]Uh-oh.
[24:15.97]Wait.
[24:17.05]What's going on?
[24:21.85]Alright, help me here.
[24:22.56]Ready?
[24:22.98]That's another hundred fucking subs from Freddy.
[24:24.92]Freddy, you guys are gonna... It's a ton of money, dude.
[24:29.14]Thank you.
[24:30.58]And the next time you're in Vegas, hit me up.
[24:35.06]Okay, so you guys gotta help me here.
[24:37.57]He's insane.
[24:38.95]No, I'm a little rusty.
[24:42.89]Okay, you ready?
[24:44.07]One, two, three.
[24:46.87]One, two, three.
[24:48.67]One, two, three.
[24:50.99]Are we matched up?
[24:57.15]Load game.
[24:57.95]New game.
[24:58.63]Load game.
[24:59.07]New game.
[24:59.57]We good?
[25:01.13]Is it delay?
[25:02.01]Not at all.
[25:08.44]There's not a 10 second delay.
[25:10.54]Get out of here.
[25:11.60]Mod.
[25:11.92]I need a mod to do this.
[25:13.24]Mod.
[25:13.60]Is it alright?
[25:15.50]Is it too... Is it too early or too late?
[25:18.46]I don't even have any mods.
[25:24.58]That's kind of a bad test.
[25:25.89]Fuck.
[25:28.58]Alright, ready?
[25:30.60]When I make noise... Use it.
[25:39.00]Alright, how about this?
[25:40.84]Ready?
[25:41.04]Okay, you got it?
[25:44.62]Turn that off.
[25:45.36]Oh, vibration.
[25:47.24]One, two.
[25:48.19]One, two.
[25:49.21]One, two, three.
[25:52.01]One, two, three, four.
[25:54.29]Good.
[25:57.61]So I'm late.
[25:59.49]Am I late?
[26:00.03]There's a slight delay.
[26:02.21]Me?
[26:02.51]Am I late?
[26:04.17]Or is the game... Am I early?
[26:09.21]I'm late.
[26:09.63]My voice is a little late.
[26:10.93]Okay.
[26:11.29]Got it.
[26:11.65]Check it out.
[26:12.03]Ready?
[26:14.55]Here we go.
[26:15.09]Ready?
[26:17.10]One, two.
[26:17.74]One, two.
[26:18.52]One, two.
[26:19.64]One, one.
[26:20.56]One, one.
[26:21.50]Up, up, up, up, up.
[26:25.32]Okay.
[26:30.30]I thought that just said enemy lifeguard.
[26:33.44]What the hell does that mean?
[26:34.16]Here we go.
[26:34.52]New game.
[26:34.84]I'm ready.
[26:35.12]No more stalling.
[26:40.55]Well, I'm not that good at video games.
[26:46.87]Oh, this is ugly.
[26:53.22]Like, really ugly.
[26:54.04]I thought this was supposed to be PlayStation 2 on the PlayStation 3.
[26:56.58]Upgraded graphics.
[27:02.83]Easy means normal?
[27:08.52]Well, why didn't you tell me that?
[27:10.70]Alright, how do you play?
[27:11.58]Didn't I hate this game when I played it for 10 seconds?
[27:13.08]I swear to God, I hated this game.
[27:13.96]I was like, oh, this game's stupid.
[27:15.54]Is there a reason why I stopped playing this?
[27:18.30]Probably.
[27:34.79]Why am I playing this again?
[27:36.30]Okay.
[27:39.22]Alright, you got square, square, square.
[27:45.66]What's block?
[27:46.55]Is there no tutorial?
[27:51.87]Okay, is there a... Is there a lock-on?
[27:57.99]The game is actually terrible.
[27:59.31]Stop.
[28:00.95]Okay, hold on.
[28:02.71]There's a dodge.
[28:03.63]Let me just check out the moves.
[28:04.51]Okay, how do I turn?
[28:05.55]R2?
[28:06.95]Does R2 do anything?
[28:07.85]L2.
[28:08.43]Boring.
[28:09.76]L2 does the Dark Souls.
[28:10.86]Oh, shit.
[28:12.10]The guy fell down.
[28:12.74]What an idiot.
[28:16.50]God, I hope the guy is here.
[28:18.68]That has requested this game a million times.
[28:21.28]Snoozen, are you here?
[28:21.96]That's the only reason why I'm doing this.
[28:27.47]It's like playing a fighting game in the arcade.
[28:32.01]Stinger!
[28:33.45]What is that?
[28:34.85]What button is that supposed to be?
[28:38.01]Pretty good DDT.
[28:40.09]He's not here.
[28:48.07]He's not even here.
[28:49.23]He's gonna shit his pants when he realizes he missed this stream.
[28:59.78]It's actually kind of fun.
[29:00.84]Alright, R1 does like a super move.
[29:03.20]Shockwave.
[29:03.82]Ball Buster.
[29:04.76]Can you string stuff together?
[29:18.21]Can I move?
[29:18.93]I can't move the camera back.
[29:19.87]This game was made in like 1998.
[29:23.99]Kind of like Dark Souls.
[29:25.29]Okay, cool.
[29:27.49]I made that joke already.
[29:28.45]Fuck, I'm pretty rusty.
[29:29.27]Sorry.
[29:29.55]Guys, I haven't made any jokes in two and a half months.
[29:37.19]You understand that, right?
[29:39.39]I've been lying down watching The Chase on my iPad for two months.
[29:46.11]I know a lot more trivia than I did before, but my comedy might be a little bit diminished.
[29:53.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[29:54.96]God stomp.
[29:56.00]Holy shit.
[30:00.05]Did it again?
[30:02.07]Okay.
[30:05.07]That's an EU game show?
[30:12.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:13.30]You don't understand.
[30:14.02]I watched the American version.
[30:15.48]So, it's the beast.
[30:18.54]Alright, let's get on with this.
[30:22.22]That's really all the content I have.
[30:24.78]It's just the chase.
[30:25.94]I don't have any other content.
[30:26.94]It's all my content.
[30:30.38]Shit.
[30:38.19]Wait, this is a... This is a... Oh!
[30:41.07]Wait, go back.
[30:41.55]Back, back, back, back, back, back.
[30:42.43]Run, run, run, run, run back.
[30:43.60]I don't even know what way is back.
[30:50.57]Tutorial.
[30:51.09]Right.
[30:51.41]Use the right analog stick to evade.
[30:53.07]What was that?
[30:59.53]Food?
[31:00.83]There's coins and shit.
[31:02.32]Alright, nice.
[31:02.76]Okay, so I got 400 gold.
[31:04.48]This is a way.
[31:12.60]I think I'm getting the hang of this.
[31:19.33]Is it 30 FPS?
[31:20.53]I mean, it is a PlayStation 2 game.
[31:22.11]What about circle?
[31:26.25]Wait, whoa, hold on a minute.
[31:27.29]Triangle's a move too.
[31:28.37]Hold on.
[31:30.98]Okay.
[31:31.66]Triangle, X, and square are punches, kicks, and... Got it.
[31:35.44]Alright.
[31:37.92]What is this?
[31:38.48]Do you buy stuff?
[31:39.96]I'm starting to like this game.
[31:40.88]He's got a weapon.
[31:41.42]Can you use weapons?
[31:42.56]Ooh, alright.
[31:47.86]Can I pick that up?
[31:48.65]Yeah, I can.
[31:49.15]This game just got way cooler.
[31:51.63]Oh yeah, this game just got way cooler.
[31:57.59]You can make your own game.
[31:59.27]What?
[32:00.35]You can make your own game?
[32:02.66]I think I may have read that wrong.
[32:09.22]Carry?
[32:09.92]Oh, cool.
[32:10.46]Alright.
[32:13.29]Level 1?
[32:16.98]I can't wait for him to never play this again.
[32:19.12]Well, this is the goal for me, is to play this.
[32:22.56]Press start.
[32:27.39]Roulette?
[32:33.73]Wild pitch.
[32:36.01]Select a technique to exchange.
[32:37.33]I want wild pitch.
[32:39.99]What?
[32:42.89]Oh, uses one orb, uses two orbs.
[32:46.07]Or three orbs.
[32:49.21]There's a dev here?
[32:49.91]That'd be interesting.
[32:56.49]Doesn't this studio not exist anymore?
[32:59.35]Techniques.
[33:02.96]Okay, so I can- wait.
[33:06.18]So that's left jab.
[33:08.24]Straight left hook uppercut.
[33:11.69]Oh yeah, okay.
[33:14.75]Dude, okay.
[33:15.69]You know what this... You guys have played WWF No Mercy?
[33:22.11]Do I unlock moves?
[33:23.67]You guys have never played No Mercy?
[33:32.01]Oh yeah, that's right.
[33:32.71]I'm an old guy.
[33:34.85]I don't think I have anything I can do about this, right?
[33:37.78]Guard breaker, charged... Wait, charged punch.
[33:43.77]I think so.
[33:45.15]Wait, I already have that.
[33:47.09]That's down and triangle.
[33:48.87]Alright.
[33:50.33]I like that one.
[33:54.55]I'm an old guy.
[33:55.41]Yeah, I am.
[33:59.25]Jerm is the only person streaming this game on Twitch.
[34:01.43]I feel like you could say that about almost every stream that's done on this channel.
[34:06.08]With the exception of, like, Mario Sunshine.
[34:09.40]Alright, let me see this thing.
[34:10.20]This is important.
[34:12.71]So you can cycle choices.
[34:13.97]Oh, alright.
[34:15.15]Well, how do I throw this at this guy?
[34:21.46]Alright.
[34:21.86]Nice.
[34:22.12]I'm into it.
[34:24.02]I'm into it.
[34:24.58]Why is this controller so sticky?
[34:27.34]It's kind of grossing me out.
[34:30.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:32.54]Level down?
[34:33.14]What do you mean level down?
[34:34.52]You can level down?
[34:35.42]Wait, level down?
[34:45.45]What happens if you die?
[34:54.30]PS3 controllers are just sticky by default.
[34:57.40]You know what?
[34:57.96]I actually... I'm dead.
[34:59.84]I believe that.
[35:00.66]I actually believe what you just said.
[35:05.92]Continue.
[35:06.40]Yes, of course.
[35:10.52]They're just sticky.
[35:11.50]It's just the way it is.
[35:13.37]Somebody paints it.
[35:14.47]Alright, so I have- I can't- No more fucking around.
[35:16.70]Let's go.
[35:17.00]I'm gonna beat this right now.
[35:17.70]I used to be able to do that.
[35:29.23]Yeah, okay.
[35:30.65]Yeah, now you got me in my game mode.
[35:38.13]Use Guard Breaker?
[35:38.87]Okay, he will.
[35:39.83]It's just a... Alright, I gotta... I'm not gonna... What's wrong with him?
[35:50.82]Get!
[35:53.92]Oh yeah, I remember laughing at that.
[35:54.86]I thought it was so funny.
[35:59.42]Stomp him!
[36:06.44]Cool.
[36:10.84]Oh, that's a lot of money.
[36:11.76]I think I did better, so I got more money.
[36:19.42]There's not a time limit or anything, right?
[36:27.77]There was a hundred subs?
[36:28.93]When?
[36:29.13]Alright, now let me try this.
[36:32.09]Ready?
[36:32.23]Check this out.
[36:32.57]Ready?
[36:34.07]Okay.
[36:34.77]Divine Smash.
[36:42.79]That was pretty good.
[36:44.25]That was pretty cool.
[36:49.21]I can't wait to just make uppercuts only.
[36:50.98]Give me that.
[37:01.96]If you're looking for insane combos, you're not going to get them from me.
[37:04.42]I'm pretty much... Guys, remember when you watched me play Lord of the Rings?
[37:09.09]Remember how everyone was so mad that I was just doing the XXX combo the whole game, even though I had other stuff?
[37:15.98]Oh, wait!
[37:28.94]Snoozencopter's here?
[37:31.16]Snoozen, what's up?
[37:33.95]I have- I have to read this.
[37:35.43]This person gave $100, and thank you for that.
[37:37.58]But I need to read this, because this is like- this person's been waiting for this stream for like two years.
[37:42.30]I'm so happy you're finally playing it.
[37:43.78]It's the best one-week early birthday gift I could have gotten.
[37:47.78]This is the only time I'll ever give $100.
[37:49.50]There's so many moves to unlock once you get the hub world.
[37:52.89]There's a baseball home run swing as a special move.
[37:55.17]Chat was lying.
[37:55.99]I never missed this stream.
[37:56.99]I was here for the No More Heroes section.
[37:58.75]You liars.
[38:01.67]Well, you're gonna be really disappointed when I give up on 15 at the exact same place that I stopped last year.
[38:15.44]Shit, I wasn't fast enough.
[38:16.82]You gotta be fast.
[38:20.12]What the hell?
[38:21.44]Why did I watch so many episodes of this chase and not like play games?
[38:33.74]Oh my god.
[38:34.90]What the fuck?
[38:37.12]Wait, I can't do a move.
[38:40.82]Wild pitch.
[38:45.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[38:46.71]Do it again.
[38:47.03]Do it again.
[38:47.59]Step on it.
[38:48.01]Step on it.
[38:48.81]Stop his head.
[38:56.35]Run, run, run.
[38:57.21]Is there any... Where's the cherries?
[39:03.72]I want to do Wild Pitch.
[39:04.72]Ball Buster!
[39:05.22]Alright, what is that?
[39:14.65]Okay, somebody tell me what the bar on the bottom means.
[39:16.63]What's the bar mean?
[39:20.57]Oh my god, he's gonna follow me.
[39:21.47]He's gonna follow me.
[39:21.93]He's gonna follow me up here.
[39:22.61]He's gonna follow me up here.
[39:23.35]He's gonna follow me.
[39:25.55]R2.
[39:25.77]Please do R2.
[39:28.55]What?
[39:29.21]What is this?
[39:29.87]Is this the God Hand?
[39:31.09]Oh shit, this is the God Hand!
[39:32.99]Get the fuck over here!
[39:45.69]I didn't know what that was.
[39:58.65]Alright, you can stop playing now.
[39:59.97]Yeah, maybe I will.
[40:02.69]It feels good to be back.
[40:09.63]Don't kick that, right?
[40:10.47]This is a red barrel.
[40:12.15]Alright, what the?
[40:12.97]That would have been really bad.
[40:13.89]Okay, where am I taking this?
[40:24.17]You're the God Hand.
[40:29.48]Holy shit.
[40:30.52]That broke the whole room.
[40:33.40]Ooh, burgers.
[40:34.20]Alright, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[40:46.43]I should have given this game more of a chance.
[40:48.82]I feel bad that I didn't.
[40:49.96]That was a pretty good juggle right there.
[40:53.78]You know?
[40:55.38]For the nine-year-old that's playing the Mortal Kombat cabinet.
[41:00.00]That's the kind of combo where like six people around this little kid are like, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[41:04.38]And he's like, yeah!
[41:14.35]Don't fuck this up here.
[41:15.19]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[41:16.23]What am I doing?
[41:23.31]Upstairs, go upstairs.
[41:24.08]I'm not fucking around with this.
[41:28.14]Okay, yeah, there's probably food in here.
[41:29.54]Where is he?
[41:39.32]Oh, shit.
[41:39.74]Oh, my God.
[41:40.12]That just made him mad.
[41:42.30]That just made him mad.
[41:42.80]Is this cardboard?
[41:43.50]Did this even hurt?
[41:49.68]I gotta be honest.
[41:50.54]I don't think that would hurt.
[41:51.86]Is that weird for me to say that?
[41:53.82]Like, an empty wood box like that, I feel like that wouldn't hurt that much.
[42:01.77]If it was an empty box and it wasn't that heavy.
[42:03.37]Don't you think it would just kind of like bounce off your chest and like hurt a little?
[42:07.39]You'd get like a bruise.
[42:09.37]L1 is quick turn.
[42:10.25]Holy shit.
[42:10.95]Give that person mod.
[42:12.56]No, don't.
[42:16.52]I don't want that person to have power.
[42:20.12]It's a wooden crate, not cardboard.
[42:21.74]I still, I mean, I still don't think it would hurt that much.
[42:27.49]The fuck?
[42:28.23]I didn't know he was right next to me.
[42:29.41]Alright, am I gonna start at the very beginning if I lose?
[42:34.73]Wait.
[42:37.73]Yes, oh shit, okay.
[42:42.46]I unlocked something.
[42:43.52]Uppercut?
[42:45.04]Ooh, right hook.
[42:46.28]Wait, okay, left jab.
[42:49.44]Oh, fuck that.
[42:50.84]Left hook, right hook.
[42:52.72]Left hook, right hook.
[42:59.43]Left hook, right hook.
[43:02.03]Left hook, right hook.
[43:06.74]Why not?
[43:08.30]I can't do the same move more than once?
[43:10.86]Oh, that's fine.
[43:12.86]Okay, yeah.
[43:15.38]That's alright.
[43:15.82]That's fine.
[43:16.58]That's fine.
[43:32.38]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose!
[43:35.86]Where's the food?
[43:36.44]Where's the best place to get food?
[43:39.92]You too.

[55:48.82]Yeah, that's angry.
[55:49.88]So it should be like... Yep.
[55:51.39]Alright, I'm good.
[55:59.92]Did I get any new roulettes or anything?
[56:07.14]No.
[56:08.83]Okay, let's go.
[56:11.79]I took two bites of that Steakums sandwich and all I smell is what the pan smells like after you make it.
[56:23.80]Not even the Steakums, I'm talking about the pan.
[56:33.62]Oh shit!
[56:37.72]I'm sorry, I should have prefaced.
[56:38.64]That was what my burp smelled like.
[56:40.94]Sorry.
[56:45.66]My burp just smelt like the pan.
[56:48.48]Oh, there's a next area.
[56:49.72]Okay.
[56:51.32]Finally.
[56:53.00]Save the game.
[56:59.22]Thank god.
[57:05.81]Okay, enter.
[57:08.59]There's a casino in this game?
[57:13.29]That's...
[57:19.57]alright wait oh wow no way I can't believe this is in here video poker oh yeah this is great okay
[57:46.71]Ah, we're gonna, we're gonna hold on to those two kings and we're gonna see if we can get a three.
[57:51.55]Alright, that's 200 bucks.
[57:54.07]Play high or low?
[57:55.11]Sure.
[57:58.65]Oh, it's gonna be lower than that card.
[58:00.21]Thank you.
[58:02.29]I'll take the 400.
[58:02.89]Let's do it again.
[58:06.61]Oh, that's gonna be much higher than a three.
[58:08.21]Why would it be lower than a three?
[58:09.83]The odds of that happening are impossible.
[58:18.10]That's a perfect number.
[58:20.12]No, it's not.
[58:20.66]What are you, fucking 12?
[58:21.72]Come on, Jeremy.
[58:26.62]Grow up.
[58:26.96]What is this one?
[58:29.41]Wait, I... Can you get thrown out of the casino?
[58:34.49]Why are lows the game to play if you're into double or nothing?
[58:39.41]That's only if you guess right.
[58:50.25]You can.
[58:51.59]Oh, should I have to fight him?
[58:56.24]He just almost insta-killed me.
[58:58.44]Kick him with the ball!
[59:15.70]Oh shit, I didn't even hurt him.
[59:28.70]What's his name?
[59:29.28]Mr. Satan from Dragon Ball Z, right?
[59:33.22]Didn't he suck?
[59:33.70]I remember playing Dragon Ball Z, Budokai, whatever the fuck it was called.
[59:38.78]And when you picked Mr. Satan, you didn't do any damage to anybody, which is kind of funny that they put him in the game in the first place.
[59:46.59]That's what I just felt like right there.
[59:51.61]What is this?
[59:53.59]Well, you don't lose any money.
[59:56.39]I'm going back in there.
[59:57.33]I'm going back in.
[60:10.32]Do the dog race?
[60:11.58]I don't know what that is.
[60:13.94]Is it blackjack?
[60:15.40]There's a pool.
[60:17.06]There's a huge pool table.
[60:20.87]Is it with bowling balls?
[60:22.15]That looks gigantic.
[60:23.01]Am I nuts?
[60:25.39]Okay, I want to play slot machine.
[60:36.56]Whenever you clear a stage, you can try new missions at the fighting ring.
[60:40.78]According to the street chat, this is a nice bonus for clearing all 40 missions.
[60:46.04]Who's this?
[60:54.26]Blackjack!
[60:57.73]Ah, yes.
[60:58.31]Okay, here we go.
[60:58.89]Bet max.
[61:00.09]Deal.
[61:02.73]That's a 15 versus 3.
[61:04.41]Oh, shit.
[61:06.21]Oh, shit.
[61:07.11]I'm gonna stand...
[61:10.44]Whatever.
[61:10.76]That's shitty.
[61:11.36]That's shitty.
[61:12.64]Do it again.
[61:16.80]Tax it out again.
[61:20.72]That's a 20.
[61:21.20]You know what?
[61:22.36]I'm just gonna stand.
[61:23.38]You probably got a 22.
[61:23.92]Oh!
[61:24.20]Oh!
[61:28.94]Where was the insurance?
[61:30.35]Although, who does that?
[61:31.35]Why even say insurance ever at any casino?
[61:33.37]No one ever does it.
[61:34.05]13 versus 5.
[61:36.03]You're gonna have to stay on that one.
[61:45.06]Did I just did I just get Omega lulled by staying with anything over with if you have anything over a 12 and They show five or six and I'm getting Omega lulled on that one Bet max I am betting max It's a $500 table
[62:12.32]Oh, yep.
[62:12.90]This is 11.
[62:13.91]You double down immediately versus 6.
[62:22.99]That was the worst thing that could have happened.
[62:25.75]11 with a showing of 6.
[62:27.33]You double that every day.
[62:30.68]That's not good.
[62:35.56]Alright, we're doing alright.
[62:37.84]Doubling down on 11...
[62:40.34]Yeah, you do that every time.
[62:42.62]I'm not gonna lose all my money.
[62:47.65]But I'm not getting up off the table until I get to 10 grand.
[62:55.47]Safe.
[62:57.65]Draw.
[62:57.79]It's called a push.
[63:03.12]Why is this in here?
[63:04.42]This is why you wanted me to play this game so bad, huh?
[63:07.90]You better not have blackjack or I'm gonna fucking scream.
[63:12.90]Look!
[63:14.14]Wait, look at it.
[63:14.70]We're at, what, 59?

[63:26.50]I'm going for it.
[63:27.00]Let's go.
[63:42.14]There's an ace.
[63:49.94]You know what's funny?
[63:50.68]Sometimes the drunk guy at the table has no idea what's going on.
[63:56.99]How many does that have?
[63:58.72]Uh, showing an ace.
[64:00.20]What do I have?
[64:00.76]17?
[64:01.50]I'm gonna double that down.

[64:45.02]Shit.
[64:45.97]Oh no.
[64:48.67]What does double down mean?
[64:49.73]Double down means you have to take another card and you put up double your bet.
[64:55.52]It's only for advanced players.
[65:03.75]No, what happened to my money?
[65:05.27]I had $6,900.

[75:51.83]Can't you just tell the person to come over behind the counter and show them how to do it?
[75:58.11]I can't teach that move.
[75:59.01]I don't remember what it is.
[76:00.20]Once I tell somebody else, it's deleted from my brain.
[76:03.42]I don't know what... I have no idea.

[77:55.14]I don't have any money.

[78:23.17]I have- I've been- It's been two months!
[78:51.21]If I was quick with it, it would have been Aisha and Tuma.
[79:01.01]Gotta give me some slack for the first time back.
[79:11.67]I don't know why I thought she was gonna say bed.
[79:16.53]It's time to get to bed.
[79:25.47]Why does it say God Hand on it?
[79:37.38]Is that like official stationery of the game?
[79:39.56]Why does it have a brand on it?
[79:40.72]Why does it have the game on it?
[79:42.32]That's weird.
[79:47.17]What happened?
[79:55.10]Oh, from when the bouncer beat the shit out of me.
[79:57.50]Okay.
[79:57.80]Alright, I remember.
[79:59.96]Alright, let's go.
[80:03.60]I don't understand the whole level up thing.
[80:09.67]Whoa, that was a cool reversal.
[80:14.97]Can I eventually get new moves to the ground?
[80:19.09]Okay.
[80:25.06]Hey!
[80:26.18]Holy shit, that guy just backflipped and that was cool.
[80:44.26]Really?
[80:46.12]Oh yeah, I forgot Jerma Plays is there too now, isn't it?
[80:51.76]Yeah.
[80:55.88]Step on his head!
[81:09.67]That's the best move in the game.
[81:13.89]They still do it even when they move.
[81:15.61]You know what?
[81:15.97]I just wanna... That was cool.
[81:23.17]Kind of a waste, but you know, whatever.
[81:29.99]Use guard when they're blocking?
[81:33.17]Does it knock them around or knock them down?
[81:43.90]Is it... What's case sensitive?
[81:47.68]Wait, what's going on?
[81:55.44]Alright.
[81:58.14]I'm going to take... Ooh, coin.
[81:59.38]Alright, let me take the explosive.
[82:00.46]Hi.
[82:02.96]Alright, what's this tutorial?
[82:08.65]Pressing the left analog stick forward twice will...
[82:31.89]Uh-oh.
[82:33.73]Mm-hmm.
[82:39.27]That's me.
[82:41.93]Level two.
[82:42.49]Alright.
[82:43.17]What does that mean, though?
[82:45.59]What does that mean?
[82:46.23]I fucked it up.
[82:49.24]I'm so...
[83:00.98]Can you fall off?
[83:02.66]The game is harder when you level up.
[83:05.08]Do you get more money?
[83:10.90]Nice.
[83:13.42]What are you doing?
[83:14.20]Why is he go- Okay, that was weird.
[83:15.50]He just actually was walking towards that guy.
[83:17.47]Like, locked onto him still.
[83:26.47]Stop doing that.
[83:28.55]Sure.
[83:28.81]No, I swear to God.
[83:30.76]Look, if I was making a laugh out loud, I fell off the edge, Joe.
[83:32.98]Don't you think I would have walked off the edge?
[83:37.31]Why stop at the edge there if you're not gonna make the leg?
[83:39.53]What?
[83:40.13]What happened?
[83:43.39]Somebody right now is screaming right now that I didn't fucking far break him.
[83:57.99]I'm not making very much money to go gamble.
[84:05.93]Charge that punch for more damage?
[84:14.14]I'll try.
[84:20.52]Azel, as the newest member of the four devas, you had better have a good reason for calling us here.
[84:28.40]That is Cosmo from the Fairly Oddparents.
[84:31.24]Thank you.
[84:31.62]I'll take 100 points.
[84:32.66]I'll take 100 points for that one.
[84:42.79]Sure about that?
[84:45.45]I can feel it.
[84:48.05]Mine is a hundred.
[84:48.83]It is!
[84:49.65]Look it up!
[84:50.15]It is.
[84:51.68]He is a God Hand.
[84:57.90]God Hand is so blasé.
[85:03.16]Call me the devil hand.
[85:05.31]I don't care what you call yourself.
[85:07.73]I don't trust dirty humans.
[85:09.17]Devil hand.
[85:11.21]Your kind is so incredibly stubborn.
[85:14.22]Humans will be nothing but worker bees creating honey in our Paradise.
[85:18.92]I can think of other things to do with mortal men.
[85:28.66]So many uses.
[85:30.78]They can be such wonderful toys.
[85:34.14]You loco chica, no way!
[85:36.93]Let me deal with this human cabron.
[85:40.13]Shut up, fat ass!
[85:41.01]Stop, you're gonna get hurt.
[85:41.91]Get your legs off my tail!
[85:45.64]Doesn't that hurt your hands?
[85:46.74]You need to use those.
[85:47.58]That was it.
[85:49.98]Oh, shit.
[85:50.78]No, it's not even worth it.
[85:55.59]600 bucks.
[85:56.79]Not even worth it.
[86:02.59]What, am I going to go play one hand of blackjack?
[86:07.50]No.
[86:17.58]I want to play at least five hands of blackjack.
[86:25.58]This stream cannot be 50% gambling.
[86:28.83]This thing stinks.

[87:48.06]And that's not even that big of a deal.
[87:49.66]This really has been, what, sitting here maybe an hour?
[87:51.68]Two hours?
[87:53.28]I, like, was like, oh, yeah, maybe I'll bite that.

[91:41.53]Wait.
[91:42.09]Hold on.
[91:45.61]This is really important.
[91:49.81]Who is this?
[91:52.59]Let me put this on the screen, because this is important to me.
[92:01.23]Cameo.
[92:03.19]I don't know who this is.
[92:03.89]Wait, do I?

[92:48.80]What the fuck is happening?
[93:03.14]I hate computers.
[93:03.82]What the fuck?
[93:08.82]What's going on?
[93:15.39]Pitcher Josh Taylor here.
[93:17.11]On behalf of the Jerma Mites, we'd like to wish you, Jerma, a healthy return to streaming.
[93:22.51]I also saw some of your work in TF2, and I think you'd be a great addition to the team.
[93:28.41]On second thought, I don't think you meet the height requirements.
[93:31.89]Remember that story in JermaCraft, episode one, where you talked about giving the double middle finger to the kid out of the back of the school bus?
[93:39.10]Look at him now, man.
[93:39.86]I don't think you're making the team anytime soon.
[93:43.08]Welcome back, brother.
[93:45.22]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[93:46.80]Boston Red Sox pitcher Josh Taylor here.
[93:49.66]On behalf of the Jerma Mites, we'd like to wish you, Jerma, a healthy return to streaming.
[93:54.88]I also saw some of your work in TF2, and I think you'd be a great addition to the team.
[93:58.85]That's the best part.
[94:00.77]On second thought, I don't think you meet the height requirements.
[94:02.65]To the Red Sox?
[94:04.27]Remember that story in JermaCraft, episode one, where you talked about...
[94:13.63]Do you think he's... Do you think he's played TF2 before?
[94:16.05]Or do you think that was him being like, I don't know what the fuck this is.
[94:19.53]He has to have, right?
[94:20.49]Who hasn't played Team Fortress?
[94:27.01]Oh.
[94:29.50]Well, that was pretty cool.
[94:33.54]I guess if I tell you the idea that I wanted to do, where I just did cameos for the whole stream, but they didn't cost anything.
[94:41.22]I literally just did them for six straight hours.
[94:46.18]It was like, we would put it at... It would just... Well, it would have to cost something.
[94:51.22]It would have to cost something.
[94:52.06]It would have to cost something.
[94:56.18]Because otherwise, how the hell would that happen?
[94:57.56]It would be your bit message comment.
[95:01.02]And it would be me doing the cameo for you.
[95:03.16]Do it with channel points.
[95:08.19]Maybe.
[95:09.35]That's so funny, though.
[95:13.65]That's... I love it.
[95:16.80]Jermamites hearing other people say that it's just it's so odd to hear that the Jermamites he's gonna be a money milker let's get back to this unfortunately you don't meet the height requirements but you don't even know how tall I am
[95:46.72]Alright, let's go.
[95:52.19]This is a little loud for me.
[95:53.65]I'm going to turn it down.
[95:56.85]Aderma, you're so slow.
[95:59.75]I know, and I'm working on it.
[96:05.44]Go.
[96:05.78]Holy shit, he just beat the shit out of me.
[96:17.23]Somebody said you can charge it?
[96:29.77]Wait, I can pick him up off the ground?
[96:32.17]Oh, that's too bad.
[96:33.03]Jesus.
[96:37.48]What the fuck was that?
[96:39.10]Give me this!
[96:44.91]You can charge it.
[96:45.83]I thought you guys were lying.
[96:55.60]There we are.
[96:56.52]Okay.
[96:58.10]Beating a dead... Whoa, that was cool.
[97:06.93]Bot machine, can I play it?
[97:10.15]Oh, he was...
[97:20.54]Oh shit!
[97:22.04]Oh shit!
[97:22.68]I came up at the wrong time!
[97:23.74]He started stomping!
[97:26.70]I know that's his secret move!
[97:32.13]Holy... Let's go.
[97:49.67]Nice.
[97:52.35]What's in this box?
[97:55.29]Chop.
[97:55.71]Acquired.
[97:56.21]Yep.
[98:02.20]Mmm.
[98:04.48]This is... Wait, that's 10?
[98:07.56]Why the hell would I have something that's 3?
[98:08.86]Okay, we're gonna do Chop.
[98:11.70]Chop.
[98:14.78]Chop.
[98:18.97]Get rid of that jab, too.
[98:22.15]Uppercut.
[98:23.91]Drop, uppercut, right hook, back fist.
[98:27.86]That's better.
[98:28.26]It's slow.
[98:30.10]It's alright, though.
[98:32.98]Dude, what a cool combo.
[98:34.12]That's a nice combo.
[98:35.92]Is that sarcastic, or do you actually mean that?
[98:38.91]Let's try it.
[98:40.33]What's that?
[98:53.19]I can't fucking believe there are like still 14,000 people here.

[99:10.18]I just did it.
[99:20.63]That move is pretty good.
[99:21.81]I'm telling you, that move is really good.
[99:25.23]It's been so long.
[99:29.00]Entertain us with a tuber voice.

[101:11.15]That's full health.
[101:13.56]Of course the strawberry Gatorade is the best flavor.
[101:16.22]Why did I take that?

[101:18.86]That was a huge mistake.
[101:19.68]I wasn't paying attention, wasn't I?
[101:27.61]Uh, purple Powerade and strawberry Gatorade.

[104:51.30]Alright, I was gonna say, no way.
[104:58.70]He's in your house as a sandwich.
[105:06.99]That was such a bad idea.
[105:09.97]Hahaha.
[105:13.16]I can't even max vet anymore.
[105:14.68]Oh, what am I doing back in here?
[105:18.75]Why am I in here?
[105:19.73]I had like 1500.
[105:29.84]Shit.
[105:35.08]Give me a 10.
[105:37.50]No!
[105:39.98]He's gonna flip over my ace.
[105:40.94]Watch, ace.
[105:44.04]I love blackjack I love gambling I don't actually 16 versus a two yeah he loves it alright 1600 go back up to exactly where I want it here we go
[106:11.26]And that's how you do it, right there.
[106:12.40]You just stay on 17 and you just put both hands hard, really hard down.
[106:17.57]So all the chips and all the cards all go up a quarter of an inch off the table at the same time.
[106:36.41]No!
[106:37.79]Oh my goodness.
[106:38.85]How many threes and fives have I gotten in this?
[106:41.51]At least I can take my last hundred dollars and
[107:08.43]Comeback.
[107:09.63]Here comes the comeback.
[107:10.47]This is the comeback, Raider.
[107:15.21]You can't softlock yourself in this game.
[107:17.69]You can just go and beat up people for money.
[107:22.90]Oh, those are eights.
[107:24.40]Stand.
[107:24.92]Always stand on eights.
[107:47.76]You all think I'm going to punch him.
[107:48.88]I'm not.
[107:53.08]You're never going to get to high roller.
[107:54.76]No, I probably won't.
[107:57.00]That's okay.
[108:02.31]I don't want to be a high roller.
[108:04.77]Guys, high roller means you do $10,000 per hand blackjack hands.
[108:09.17]I don't want to get there ever.
[108:18.59]If you can, in like 10 minutes, I've paid for college already.
[108:25.50]No, I don't ever want to get there.
[108:34.49]Where am I?
[108:34.79]What is this? $10,000?
[108:49.45]Well, no, you can do like two, you could probably do like three or four blackjack hands.
[108:54.59]And no, you can probably do five, ten blackjack hands in ten minutes.
[108:57.56]They go quick.
[108:58.12]That's not a high roller.
[109:10.44]Still gambling when I come back.
[109:12.82]When's Resident Evil 4?
[109:13.90]Oh, right.
[109:14.16]That's right.
[109:14.84]Wait, what?
[109:46.61]I'm not doing it.
[109:48.17]I'll do it, I promise, the next time he walks.
[109:49.59]Told you.
[110:01.00]What's the plot of this game?
[110:02.80]Doesn't matter.
[110:05.56]Guy is angry and has superpowers.
[110:07.52]Other guy is angry with superpowers just like this guy.
[110:10.71]They may or may not be related.
[110:13.59]There you go.
[110:15.07]That's all you need to know.
[110:29.11]He almost walked into it for me.
[110:31.32]Oh, that was so off.
[110:32.24]I feel bad.
[110:32.64]Maybe I should walk into it so he feels better about himself.
[110:37.70]I got him.
[110:39.22]Got him.
[110:39.42]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[110:42.02]Come on.
[111:05.82]Jeremy, do it.
[111:12.68]That's so good.
[111:13.60]Why the hell am I not doing that?

[113:18.06]What the fuck was that?
[113:21.06]Okay, here we go.
[113:23.78]Did I just pick up two?
[113:47.49]Alright, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

[115:50.76]I'm gonna save the god mode until a little bit later.
[116:19.07]Somebody asked if this was a rerun.
[116:21.01]No.
[116:21.97]No, it's not.
[116:22.67]I'm here.
[116:31.00]This is a rerun.
[116:34.96]Aren't you?
[116:36.80]Oh!
[116:38.70]I like streams when Jeremy makes noises that consist of... Oh!
[116:42.32]Oi!
[116:43.64]Whoa!
[116:53.18]Oh, jeez.
[117:00.98]He's right behind you.
[117:02.50]What?
[117:03.76]This guy was flying down.
[117:15.04]Oh, no!
[117:15.92]How do I stop it?
[117:16.54]Can I say no?
[117:19.49]I didn't want to do that.
[117:23.78]Okay, let's go.
[117:24.26]Alright.
[117:25.50]No, I didn't.
[117:28.35]And let's go!
[118:00.56]Oh, yeah!
[118:02.58]Damn it.
[118:08.97]Stomp him!
[118:17.02]Oh, come on!
[118:17.92]What the hell was that?
[118:19.26]I need to- No, that's not food.
[118:34.34]Oh no, what's that?
[118:34.82]They're gonna- I've never seen them do it because I always stumble with the thing.
[118:40.72]Got it.
[118:42.68]He's never getting up.
[118:43.42]Shit.
[118:50.64]Oh my goodness.
[118:57.52]Uh-oh.
[119:08.05]Oh my god, what's this book do?

[120:05.11]He must have lost his balls in the war.
[120:06.98]What?
[120:07.16]Why do you buy costumes like this?
[120:13.69]Now I got 5,400 bucks, I'm good.
[120:25.61]IGN couldn't beat this part?

[121:39.35]Ooh, okay, good.
[121:43.89]IGN gave it a 3 out of 10.
[121:46.67]Guillermo, I'm feeling sleepy.
[121:52.29]Can you tuck me in?
[121:53.05]Yeah, sure.
[122:00.63]No, we're not doing this.
[122:01.49]No, no, no, no.
[122:03.41]We're not doing that.
[122:05.67]I was about to just like... That would have gotten weird.
[122:21.56]Tuck him in now.
[122:23.61]Alright.
[122:25.69]Fine.
[122:34.05]No.
[122:34.87]How do you tuck?

[122:54.49]Don't get too many crumbs in the bed.
[122:56.19]No!
[122:56.47]Alright, goodbye.
[122:57.01]We're done.
[122:57.43]I'm not doing this anymore.
[122:59.10]I'm done.
[123:05.76]You got, like, five seconds.
[123:08.00]That's all you're getting.
[123:12.79]Our slot prizes are fit for a king.
[123:14.39]Right now, hitting the jackpot will earn you a new technique?
[123:18.13]Holy shit.
[123:20.53]You're a bad father.
[123:22.01]I'm not your father.
[123:23.15]Don't you think that's... I'm not your dad.
[123:25.77]I'm not your guardian.
[123:26.77]Don't you think that's a little strange?
[123:38.24]Sad, sad, sad.
[123:41.56]Like, I'm not your guardian, right?
[123:44.60]I'm not your, you know, fatherly figure in your life.
[123:47.72]Or mother, doesn't matter.
[123:49.10]The motherly, fatherly.
[123:51.95]I'm a guy.
[123:52.68]Would you want just a guy to come in and tuck you in?
[123:57.65]Double that down please.
[123:58.39]Thank you.
[124:11.69]yes to be honest do it again perfect yeah that's how you do it that's how you do two double downs in a row
[124:43.59]That was such a bad time to do that too, it is blackjack.
[124:46.13]I had to turn it over.
[124:49.73]Oh, that's fine.
[124:56.42]This is some pretty sick, like, Ghostbusters for the regular Nintendo music.
[125:02.87]Love it.
[125:11.91]Getting close to 10k.
[125:12.99]We're almost there.
[125:13.63]I'm going to go buy some moves.
[125:21.66]5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[125:26.64]You have to stand here.
[125:27.50]You have to stand.
[125:28.16]You can't
[125:32.20]You don't win that no matter what.
[125:37.85]You don't hit that.
[125:38.55]You don't hit that.
[125:42.53]You don't hit that.
[125:43.09]Guys, I have won $75,000 playing Blackjack.
[125:46.43]I've also lost about $88,000 playing Blackjack.
[125:48.11]I think I know.
[125:50.19]Playing Blackjack.
[125:59.68]There it is.
[126:01.18]There's your 10k.
[126:03.84]10,600.
[126:03.94]That means we got a clean...
[126:21.77]Okay, uh, I don't I don't know.
[126:24.14]I don't know what this is That's like 5 or 15.
[126:27.48]But then when another ace comes up, I I don't know what that does I don't know what this is.
[126:32.14]I have no idea I don't I don't know what that is What is this?
[126:41.99]This is now 16 Five I just got three thousand dollars to have five cards
[126:54.93]Holy shit.
[127:02.09]No blackjack.
[127:04.05]Up.
[127:05.31]Fuck you.
[127:09.12]Just leave.
[127:09.72]Well, when I get to 15 now, I can leave.
[127:13.98]Every hand is the last hand unless I win.
[127:16.44]Don't you know?
[127:16.92]That's how it works when you go to the casino.
[127:22.78]Please stop gambling.
[127:38.36]I got 13 grand.
[127:40.70]I don't like the low maximums.
[127:44.02]Where's the $5,000 maximums?
[127:53.23]Stop wasting our money.
[127:59.56]Do the slots for good moves.
[128:01.10]Let me go see what's available at the shop before I do that.
[128:04.24]What's this?
[128:06.92]I've seen people say this.
[128:12.35]Warm up room.
[128:15.23]Extreme fighting ring.
[128:18.90]Take the techniques on sale in the shop for a test spin.
[128:21.60]You can set up your techniques as normal using the menu.
[128:23.69]Okay.
[128:27.67]No, I don't... I don't... Is this just like a training dummy?
[128:31.93]I didn't even hit this thing.
[128:39.94]Okay.
[129:06.84]Oh, should this guy be allowed out here?
[129:08.24]Alright.
[129:17.63]So, let's, uh, let's do it.
[129:21.63]Let's go into the extreme fighting ring.
[129:27.39]Subs, subs.
[129:28.05]Yeah, there's been so many.
[129:32.95]Poor Gore gave 50 community subs.
[129:34.71]Aroob just gave 10.
[129:37.22]There's been hundreds and hundreds of fucking subs today.
[129:44.23]It's just, it's overwhelming how much money you guys are giving me today.
[129:50.22]Thank you.
[129:51.42]I do want to make sure I make this clear again because it's been obviously a couple of hours since the beginning of the stream.
[129:58.45]I'm making some changes to the stream.
[130:00.73]I'll go over it very quickly just to make sure I can keep people aware.
[130:04.39]I'm going back to the pre-Vegas schedule where I'm only going to stream about three days a week.
[130:11.58]and after that I'm also getting it's hard for me to even say it because I feel bad and I liked it and it's just it just has to go away though the end of the stream bit reading is going away I know a lot of people probably maybe don't know that as of today it's I'm only going to stream and then we're going to do a little like maybe 10 minute wind down every stream
[130:36.38]The reasons for this are because I still haven't figured out all the medical stuff.
[130:40.18]I'm still doing it.
[130:41.00]It's still ongoing.
[130:42.40]I didn't want to just not stream for like six months.
[130:46.83]I just didn't want to.
[130:47.59]I wanted to be here.
[130:48.35]I want to stream.
[130:49.03]I like doing this.
[130:49.67]It's fun.
[130:50.73]I enjoy it.
[130:51.19]10 minute in quotes.
[130:55.69]Right.
[131:02.75]And it allows me to stream.
[131:07.07]Like, let's say the streams are going to be four to six hours because they will be just because of trying to keep myself comfortable.
[131:13.70]Those streams won't actually be like three to five hours and then like an hour of bits.
[131:17.78]They'll be four to six hours.
[131:21.67]How do I go in here?
[131:22.21]426.
[131:24.15]Am I doing something wrong?
[131:31.70]Welcome to extreme fighting.
[131:32.52]You may enter the ring after you have completed stage one.
[131:41.41]Wait, I haven't beaten the first stage of the game?
[131:44.33]That seems impossible.
[131:49.99]Somebody asked, is it temporary?
[131:51.45]I don't think so.
[131:57.19]Because I'm going to be very honest with you.
[132:01.25]If this turns out to be a long term management scenario, because it's very clear that this is not just something just, oh, yeah, I have X and I'm going to take medicine for a week and it's going to go away.
[132:14.97]I don't know what that scenario is.
[132:17.30]This could end up being a more longer term management thing.
[132:22.48]So if that's the case, then, you know, obviously that's.
[132:24.68]I think it's probably going to be permanent.
[132:34.03]Stages are like worlds, so okay.
[132:43.38]I want some- I want a new move.
[132:45.20]How come I can't get new moves?
[132:47.78]Ooh, wait.
[132:48.50]Smoothie.
[132:50.08]Wait, this increases your HP?
[132:52.14]Now that's not just like a thing that you store that you can drink for 20 health.
[132:57.07]That means you go up permanently by 20.
[133:03.82]Oh, shit.
[133:04.98]Okay, I see what this does now.
[133:06.60]Increase number of attacks by one.
[133:09.92]Increase TP by 30.
[133:16.12]What's TP?
[133:21.85]TP?
[133:22.15]Yeah.
[133:29.39]Yeah.
[133:32.77]Okay, my TP went up by 30.
[133:34.79]I hope that's a good thing.
[133:37.82]Ooh, long straight.
[133:41.88]Alright, let me try these.
[133:53.23]Sell?
[133:53.59]Let me see.
[133:58.99]So what, can I find rare techniques and sell them?
[134:09.97]yes that's actually really cool now it's ten six changing that one long straight oh what is right hook five no no
[134:43.59]But I can put these just on the regular move?
[134:48.83]I'll keep the right hook.
[134:53.36]It's fine.
[134:59.52]See what it looks like?
[135:04.61]Also, you have a lot of community content to catch up.
[135:06.55]Yes, I do.
[135:08.65]That's going to be... That is going to be very, very difficult.
[135:14.33]That's... We're talking now... Like... Hold on.
[135:16.59]Sorry.
[135:16.85]Hold on.
[135:17.87]Wait a minute.
[135:22.49]Okay.
[135:22.99]I can't even mute my microphone from my stream deck anymore?
[135:27.02]What happened in the last two months?
[135:29.02]Hold on.
[135:37.38]Morty.
[135:39.22]Anyways.
[135:40.02]I have no idea what I was just saying.
[135:42.20]I forgot everything.
[135:43.70]Right.
[135:44.12]Community content night.
[135:46.70]There's like four months of backlog.
[135:48.83]There's a four month backlog.
[135:56.63]I don't even know what the hell is going to happen.
[135:57.87]I'm going to have to figure that out.
[136:01.39]And the DLC Movie Night also has like three months of content now.
[136:10.11]We're gonna be busy on some of those days.
[136:12.98]Oh god.
[136:15.24]What?
[136:16.32]Are you guys looking for porn or something?
[136:29.83]Oh, come on.
[136:39.09]Watch out.
[136:47.44]Oh, what the hell?
[136:48.92]Counter?
[136:49.38]Do R2?
[136:50.90]No, I don't want to waste it.

[172:12.62]Elvis, what happened?
[172:15.85]See, boss, that's definitely 100% pure God Hand.
[172:24.79]Elvis, I'd love for you to take one puff of your cigar.
[172:29.79]What's that crazy gringo?
[172:33.50]You first, boss.
[172:34.76]It's been four years.
[172:36.32]This guy sounds like fun.
[172:38.90]No way, he's mine!
[172:40.44]Damn it, make up your mind!
[172:48.80]Alright.
[173:23.94]So do I get the new thing now?
[173:28.54]That's stage one.
[173:29.66]Yeah.
[173:38.21]I can buy more health now?
[173:40.19]That's important.
[173:40.87]Alright, so where... You said it was outside?
[173:44.75]This is just a complete lie.
[173:53.42]This game is going to get very hard.
[173:56.31]Yeah, I'll probably give up by then.
[173:59.11]Maybe I won't.
[174:02.55]Entry into the ring is free.
[174:06.81]Alright.
[174:10.17]Fighting ring.
[174:10.81]Number one, level two, level three.
[174:17.29]50.
[174:17.39]Alright, let's just do level one.
[174:25.88]Cool.
[174:26.52]Is there a time limit?
[174:31.11]This is not hard.
[174:38.78]This is not even hard!
[174:43.46]This is not even hard.
[174:57.21]This is literally level 1.
[174:58.89]Yeah, I know, but still.
[175:06.55]Level 1.
[175:07.12]Okay, level 2.
[175:12.74]Alright, if I just do level 6, can I get all the prizes from 2 through 5?
[175:19.31]That makes sense, right?
[175:29.01]Shit Hey Also, I'm level three This is just hard
[175:58.85]well that'd be fun for some of you that play this game and uh do that and beat this level because you're having fun playing level three that'd be fun when you do it if you feel like it running
[176:39.98]No, the only thing I know how to do.
[176:45.00]They figured me out.
[176:46.04]I don't want to do that one.
[177:06.92]Here's a tip.
[177:08.34]Can we all make him see this?
[177:09.76]Jeremy, it might help you if you incorporate a guard breaker into your square combo.
[177:16.33]That's not a bad idea.
[177:25.47]Wait, ooh, that's cool.
[177:28.99]I think I want to change this.
[177:37.27]This.
[177:37.87]That's quicker.
[177:52.30]It sucks.
[177:53.94]Oh, this sucks.
[177:54.96]But I'm going to use it for a little bit.
[177:56.16]Alright.
[178:03.91]Now I'm going to just quickly...
[178:07.59]Very quickly.
[178:11.47]Save the game.
[178:12.05]Go to the shop.
[178:25.18]Okay, Tropical Smoothie.
[178:27.46]HP by 40.
[178:27.94]First Roulette Wheel Orbs by 1.
[178:32.04]That's pretty big.
[178:35.60]Or number of attacks.
[178:36.46]Probably the health, right?
[178:38.50]It's always health.
[178:44.89]I'll get health.
[178:50.57]Straight two.
[178:52.45]K up.
[178:56.42]Kin music.
[178:57.06]Ooh, this is two.

[179:08.42]Drunken Fist.
[179:09.04]That's awesome.
[179:15.29]Alright.
[179:16.25]I'm going to have... Yeah.
[179:16.93]Let's go with Chin Music.
[179:17.83]Chin Music and... Can I afford anything else?
[179:23.69]Not really.
[179:26.53]Alright.
[179:29.06]Let's put that in.
[179:36.64]let's start with chin music into a chin music apparently what start with chin music into a roundhouse kick into nope that's too slow
[180:07.41]Into a pimp hand?
[180:10.39]Into a... Cup?
[180:12.37]Uh... I don't know.
[180:14.33]Probably this.
[180:24.10]Alright, how's it look?
[180:41.08]I want to change this to spin.
[180:42.36]That's not what I want.
[180:43.52]Low kick, maybe?
[180:45.68]High sidekick, yeah.
[180:47.94]Let's go.
[181:10.69]Guard break.
[181:11.46]I'll do it.
[181:12.26]I will do it.
[181:20.63]Use guard breaker.
[181:21.53]You need guard breaker.
[181:22.87]That's not on there?
[181:27.09]Yeah.
[181:31.34]Oh, Gene, you're back.
[181:32.62]Turn the music off, please.
[181:33.47]Don't you're back, me.
[181:34.95]I just about died because of you.
[181:36.61]But the God Hand saved you, didn't it?
[181:39.51]It's strong, but it's a pain in the ass.
[181:42.43]You should try it for a while.
[181:44.09]Let's axe it.
[181:46.33]Nice one.
[181:48.79]You want to keep it, huh?
[181:50.15]You say worst character?
[181:51.83]The main character?
[181:53.11]That's a problem when you say that.
[181:55.39]You want me to check it out.
[181:58.45]Ah, you volunteer.
[182:02.73]Why aren't all the cutscenes in this game in the same room?
[182:19.61]I feel like we've been in that bedroom for every cutscene.
[182:24.23]Can we be anywhere else?
[182:25.13]Can we go somewhere else?
[182:30.77]Let's try it.
[182:31.49]Cool.
[182:31.99]Yep, you're right.
[182:38.41]It's got to be on there.
[182:52.38]Okay.
[183:04.12]Can you stomp from that part?
[183:05.36]Get out of here.
[183:10.08]I just did it.
[183:14.16]Ooh, Keith.
[183:18.33]I think I can stomp.
[183:20.03]Let me try that.
[183:28.21]Yep.
[183:29.57]That is what I'm going to be doing, boys and girls.
[183:37.14]Can I do like a... He was giving me a prompt when he was going down there.
[183:51.61]Oh, shit.
[183:52.17]This is not an old stream.
[183:53.53]This is a new one.
[184:07.05]sure sure it is elbow spin one when am I gonna get elbow spin two or anything two I think I only have two moves that are two he's gonna shoot me in the face right well I know what to do I thought you throw it at the trebuchet but that was wrong
[184:56.50]Show us today's newspaper to prove this is a stream today.
[184:59.26]Guys, I haven't picked up a newspaper with my hands since I was probably 11.
[185:04.22]And I hate touching them.
[185:11.45]That weird, sandpapery, inky, horrible feeling when you touch a newspaper, I hate it.
[185:20.15]If I touch them, it makes me just revile.
[185:36.92]He's right.
[185:37.34]Yeah, I know.
[185:52.88]okay there we go give us the news I don't I I guys I don't I don't know what I don't know the news thank god it didn't hurt me I love when that happens I love when that happens
[186:29.95]Not really right now.
[186:34.64]I didn't say that, what?
[186:42.18]You didn't?
[186:45.65]What did you say?
[186:46.69]Alright, hold on.
[186:51.67]I'm getting my ass kicked right now.
[186:53.57]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[186:56.09]Hold that thought.
[186:58.69]I'm going to lose again.
[186:59.93]I don't like these guys.
[187:00.97]They're the worst.
[187:01.63]Those guys are the worst guys to fight anyway.
[187:06.90]You sound tired, Jeremy.
[187:09.26]I probably am.
[187:13.76]I am on painkillers.
[187:15.16]So, I mean, maybe that makes me a little tired.
[187:18.17]I don't know.
[187:23.65]He's on coke.
[187:24.59]How would coke make me tired?
[187:29.41]You know, I'm really thinking about just, like, relaxing and, you know, getting some tea, getting to bed, and doing a line of coke off my bed stand.
[187:37.02]You know, just to really unwind and go to bed.
[187:40.78]You know, so I just lie there in my bed, facing up at the ceiling, just scream.
[187:59.62]I haven't gone up here.
[188:00.20]What's up here?
[188:09.57]That move never gets old to me.
[188:12.01]It really doesn't.
[188:12.91]I love it.
[188:14.87]It never gets old.
[188:23.66]He didn't deny it.
[188:24.56]Guys, I am... Yes, I am on drugs right now.
[188:27.62]I'm on drugs right now.
[188:32.23]I had two shots into my ass and I'm on drugs right now.
[188:40.88]Prescribed by a doctor that are non-narcotic.
[188:44.66]Come on.
[188:46.06]Give me a break.
[188:58.98]Shockwave.
[189:02.02]on each cheek yes that is what happened is the guy using the power of his mohawk to do that that's really I love it okay let's just do it I'm not messing around anymore here
[189:36.74]Oh!
[189:38.63]Ass implants.
[189:39.57]Guys, my ass is huge.
[189:42.99]I don't want those, trust me.
[189:55.45]I have a huge ass.
[189:57.62]It's fucking gigantic.
[189:59.24]And I've come to terms with it.
[190:00.94]I have to come to terms with it at some point in my life.
[190:13.78]He jumped over it.
[190:16.63]Wow.
[190:20.85]Why would you say that?
[190:23.61]I don't know.
[190:27.99]Why?
[190:28.51]That's a good question.
[190:29.65]Because I just did, alright?
[190:32.09]It's canon now.
[190:37.89]It always was canon.
[190:46.35]Please come in.
[190:48.79]Okay.
[190:54.67]I need help from you?
[190:59.67]Are you going to give me help?
[191:08.32]Oh, I also have to talk about this because I didn't really mention this at all.
[191:13.46]This is really, really sad, actually.
[191:16.06]So, those of you that, during the course of the last two months, that have been popping into the Discord and the chat sometimes, I've been talking about a stream that was gonna happen where it was gonna be a baseball stream.
[191:28.93]It was gonna be two full teams.
[191:30.08]It was gonna be a full baseball game with a bunch of crazy shit.
[191:33.60]It was gonna be as big as the carnival.
[191:35.52]The deposits were already paid.
[191:39.44]I lost a deposit on this.
[191:41.60]It was ready to happen at the end of August.
[191:46.28]But it's been postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus.
[191:52.16]I did want to talk about that too because that sucked.
[191:55.90]We thought that maybe we could have had it happen if we had everybody tested.
[192:01.57]Logistically, it just wasn't going to happen.
[192:03.07]This guy is smashing me in the head over and over again with a problem.
[192:06.05]And now I'm going to just eat my stomach from it.
[192:13.96]Into the fire.
[192:46.85]Well, at least he died.
[192:54.23]He did get the last laugh, but it doesn't matter at that point, right?
[193:14.99]But it sucks because that was going to be so much fun.
[193:19.33]To give you a little gist.
[193:20.33]By the way, it's still going to happen.
[193:22.81]Everything is done.
[193:23.65]Tons of stuff has already been paid for.
[193:26.37]Everything is ready to go.
[193:27.34]It just can't happen until it's safe to have 30 or 40 people in the same spot.
[193:33.38]Reliably.
[193:34.86]Because I really didn't want to have it be the case where I was putting people in danger or we were doing something that we really shouldn't be fucking doing.
[193:44.88]The idea was that...
[193:47.02]two three months ago was like okay well hold on a minute let me see if this is uh you know over the next few months doesn't do we get like a treatment does something happen or is it do we start your cases start going down and we had that big spike in a couple of the states a few weeks ago it was just really clear it was like no we can't fuck around here we just can't do it
[194:09.37]But, um... It will happen.
[194:13.11]It's gonna happen eventually.
[194:14.61]And I cannot wait for that stream.
[194:16.81]It's gonna be my favorite stream ever.
[194:19.87]Probably like I've been wondering how the fuck why.
[194:22.71]It's just you'll see.
[194:23.47]I can't wait.
[194:23.93]It's gonna be the best stream I've ever done.
[194:27.87]Until the fucking next one, right?
[194:37.84]Will it be better than the carnival?
[194:41.79]That's tough because it's two completely different genres.
[194:48.19]It's going to be a ton of fun.
[194:54.28]Alright, fine.
[194:54.86]I didn't even lose any health.
[194:55.66]I didn't get hit once.
[194:59.78]What he's saying is I should just skip all the screens until that one.
[195:03.40]If you only want to see stuff like that, then sure.
[195:05.88]It's up to you.
[195:10.09]You're going to be waiting a long time, though.
[195:12.48]That's not going to happen for at least the next four or five months.
[195:15.18]At least.
[195:18.40]Okay, bye.
[195:18.96]No.
[195:19.02]Don't.
[195:19.98]Yeah.
[195:20.68]You don't have to.
[195:23.22]Where am I going?
[195:26.70]Is this all that was up here?
[195:27.53]Just a cool weapon?
[195:35.55]Damn.
[195:35.81]Alright.
[195:36.17]It was just for the weapon.
[195:45.49]More promises?
[195:47.63]What are the other promises?
[195:59.75]Oh yeah, Resident Evil 4.
[196:04.33]I already ate the Steak Em Sandwich.
[196:14.38]Oh, FTK.
[196:15.55]I know jokey, jokey FTK.
[196:18.05]This is a noob right here.
[196:22.29]Oh yeah, July 30th.
[196:24.17]No.
[196:25.44]FTK is done.
[196:26.10]It's ready.
[196:27.84]That will also be soon.
[196:29.96]That will probably just replace where the baseball stream is going to be.
[196:35.89]It's been 100% redesigned.
[196:38.03]It's not even close to the same thing that you saw before.
[196:40.79]It's actually like a full-on experience.
[196:42.77]It's not just dump 300 people in a Minecraft server and break the server, have everybody lag, and then have me die four times while 1,000 people run in a circle.
[196:54.09]Oops.
[196:55.05]Okay.
[196:55.45]That was...
[197:01.42]It has been... It's been being worked on since that stream happened.
[197:06.74]It kind of just haven't stopped.
[197:11.52]I didn't kill anybody.
[197:12.45]I just... I just accidentally punched.
[197:15.85]How did we leave?
[197:20.57]What does FTK stand for?
[197:21.61]It stands for Fuck the King.
[197:32.65]I I told you shit was just gonna start coming to me all stream.
[197:36.45]I have 15 webcams The webcam stream is gonna happen probably within the next couple weeks Forgot about that.
[197:43.32]I have like 16 webcam.
[197:47.30]I Don't know how you forget that but I did yeah, I have them I'm ready
[198:03.58]Not the top rope.
[198:08.19]That's going to be such a hard... I'm going to need some time to really set that up.
[198:12.53]You know how hard that's going to be to do?
[198:14.35]If I delay 15 different webcams to be happening at different times, I will lose total control.
[198:21.96]That stream is going to be terrible.
[198:24.96]I'm going to lose total fucking control.
[198:27.55]And I won't even be able to know which webcam is which.
[198:30.47]It's going to be a mess.
[198:39.06]It's gonna be the worst stream.
[198:41.42]Well, we'll see if it gets nominated.
[198:43.20]Wait, it could be best stream though, right?
[198:45.50]It's possible.
[198:46.22]One of the things I want to do... Look, it's not just gonna be a mess.
[198:56.56]I'm gonna have various activities.
[198:59.38]I told you, one of the things I want to do is I want to take a piece of my body or my face and have it be 15 different pieces that I have to put together.
[199:28.78]you did that already I did that already with like two or three webcams copied a few times I never did that with 15 webcams copied like 20 times
[199:46.65]I'm probably gonna break my USB bus driver or something.
[199:52.08]My bus driver is just gonna absolutely just... It's gonna shit the bed.
[199:55.54]Does what I say make any sense to anybody at all?
[200:03.36]I feel like I just kind of made that up hoping people wouldn't think that I like... I was like pretending to know what that was, weirdly enough.
[200:08.86]That was weird, right?
[200:11.25]I like my USB bus driver.
[200:14.93]Maybe like a hundred of you were like, oh, he knows what that is.
[200:18.26]Does that mean anything?
[200:19.38]Did I fool a hundred of you?
[200:29.53]Is there such thing as a USB bus driver?
[200:45.55]No, yes, it's redundant.
[200:47.91]How is it redundant?
[200:48.81]What does it mean?
[200:49.93]Universal... Universal Serial Bus Driver?
[200:56.82]Why do I think this is so funny?
[200:58.08]It's not even that funny.
[201:12.94]What the fuck?
[201:18.12]Serial bus driver.
[201:19.44]Okay, do you know what I'm trying to say though?
[201:29.76]Can I actually even plug in 15 webcams into my computer?
[201:35.10]Or am I going to overload the system and it's not even going to work?
[201:41.61]Because wouldn't it need to take up a certain amount of slots?
[201:47.01]Not like actual physical slots, but the USB bus driver.
[201:50.25]It can only handle like 8 or something, right?
[201:58.44]Will it work?
[201:59.72]It depends.
[202:00.14]If you have a splitter, it will work.
[202:11.81]There's like 24 seats on the bus.
[202:15.29]Okay, so that means I can technically have 24 things plugged into a USB, in quotes, even if it's an adapter or an extender.
[202:28.44]Does it matter?
[202:28.98]Does it matter, like, what operating system?
[202:40.01]You might need a USB PCIe card.
[202:44.02]See, that's the person answering the real question that I'm asking.
[202:54.72]Why are you asking this after buying 16 webcams?
[203:09.66]I didn't even... Not even one single Google search about this.
[203:14.86]Are they all 1080p?
[203:33.60]I don't even know I don't guys okay so you know how there's those companies like logitech the logitech c920 right the c250 these are not logitechs these are the ones that get sponsored on Amazon
[204:05.34]Amazon's choice.
[204:09.00]Look, they could... I'm not even sure they're HD, which is probably a good thing.
[204:13.56]What am I doing?
[204:18.10]I'm going against my... Stop losing.
[204:25.21]Stop.
[204:29.43]I'm getting such shitty hands.
[204:30.97]This is not even fair.
[204:37.60]okay somebody got it thank you thank you I want this person to be known somebody said it I have to scroll up hold on here we go this is from tree fitty thank you you have a minimum of 16 lanes which means 16 devices for the pci slots so that guy isn't far off thank you
[205:00.04]So, there you go.
[205:02.02]Imagine if I have to buy a PCI USB SWAT thing.
[205:15.55]Alright, come on.
[205:19.16]Give me the five cards, three grand.
[205:20.78]Here we go.
[205:30.42]Well, well, well.
[205:32.21]It was worth a shot.
[205:33.39]I almost had it, but not quite.
[205:36.71]Oh, I forgot everybody hates that voice.
[205:40.09]Right.
[205:41.13]In a couple months, I forget.
[205:42.41]This is bad.
[205:47.55]What is that?
[206:00.39]What is that?
[206:00.81]What is that?
[206:01.21]What's that mean?
[206:03.11]That's 2.
[206:03.43]That's 3 or 13.
[206:05.41]Plus K. Is... Okay, now that's 20.
[206:11.02]Is this 20?
[206:11.28]It is, yeah?
[206:21.64]Alright, coming back.
[206:26.16]Why would I hit that?
[206:28.40]That's 20.
[206:28.66]What the heck?
[206:29.02]4, 5, 6.
[206:29.10]7, 8.
[206:29.14]18.
[206:29.16]How many 21s is he going to get?
[206:48.88]Okay, finally.
[206:50.36]21, yeah.
[206:56.94]Can we get a shuffle, please?
[206:58.33]Can you shuffle that deck?
[207:04.25]How many times I've gone to this buffet here?
[207:10.70]I think I can request a shuffle.
[207:13.56]Thank you.
[207:22.19]How much money did I have when I sat down?
[207:31.26]I'm feeling a streak coming with like a wicked sad guy.
[207:34.50]What is that?
[207:57.01]No!
[207:59.91]No!
[208:01.07]No!
[208:02.39]I'm doing that a lot today.
[208:06.14]Oh my.
[208:15.44]That's the funny Reddit guy.
[208:17.02]You think I'm the funny Reddit guy?
[208:18.42]That's me, the funny Reddit guy.
[208:23.19]I keep losing.
[208:32.37]What the fuck, man?
[208:33.69]I'm not gonna... I can't lose...
[208:52.02]The number of webcams that can be connected to your computer is limited by the USB bus.
[209:04.68]and the video resolution in general it should be fine to connect three to four webcams you want to connect more you have to increase the usb bandwidth by adding pci to usb cards I told you I told you alright I'm gonna get a how many pci slots do I have to take the video card out okay so how many pci cards do I need
[209:42.26]wait the easy solution the problem is to buy an inexpensive usb hub usb standard supports up to 127 devices and usb hubs are part of the standard I mean that's I bought a usb hub
[210:09.35]127, then you're fine.
[210:10.69]Okay, so that's... Oh, that's zero dollars.
[210:18.58]Unless you reduced every webcam FPS output to 15, your PC would be rendering 1680 frames per second, which would melt your computer.
[210:40.31]Oh, okay.
[210:40.69]That's alright.
[210:42.07]You absolutely need either 1x16 card or 2x8.
[210:46.39]Huh.
[210:46.81]Set up a fan?
[211:10.63]Did I just take the side of my computer off?
[211:13.91]And just put one of those little fans just blowing right on the graphics card?
[211:17.61]That would be even worse.
[211:33.15]That's not how computers work.
[211:42.00]This intake, exhaust.
[211:43.60]What if I just made an extra... Oh shit, I have to stomp these out.
[211:58.61]Get the right guy for the job.
[212:06.66]Close back out, not back in.
[212:09.95]Just put a bunch of hot air on the computer.
[212:12.51]Get out of here.
[212:15.53]Don't do that.
[212:16.93]Don't do that.
[212:20.33]Just seriously jump over that.
[212:29.04]They're screaming.
[212:29.90]All those cameras at like 20 feet would be kind of hilarious.
[212:32.72]Oh my god, I have to play the game.
[212:37.82]What are the specs of the birdhouse?
[212:38.92]I need to know so I can recommend a suitable formula for seasoning your motherboard.
[212:45.45]Please just stop listening to these people.
[212:46.75]You just need a powered USB hub and you'll be fine.
[212:50.47]Finally.
[212:51.65]We need a new house.
[212:55.27]Wire.
[213:09.32]No, I really do remember.
[213:10.36]You know how I know this?
[213:12.38]Because I remember a long time ago, I had a ton of things plugged into USB.
[213:18.87]And I couldn't get a controller to work because I ran out of USB bus driver slots.
[213:24.33]And I remember it stuck with me forever.
[213:25.47]This was probably 10 to 15 years ago.
[213:29.03]I remember this happening.
[213:38.51]A USB hub is not going to give you bandwidth.
[213:40.23]Yeah, that's what I'm concerned about.
[213:55.37]Oh, shit.
[214:00.24]Oh, shit.
[214:03.76]There we are.
[214:05.66]Give me that melee.
[214:11.69]Throw it.
[214:12.81]Throw it!
[214:14.85]Holy shit, that does a lot of damage.
[214:16.23]Give me yours.
[214:16.67]Let me tell you guys the story about how me and Burger Boy went to go get iced coffees before.
[214:25.53]And he got two huge iced coffees and he drank them both in five minutes.
[214:29.79]And then he looked at me and he said, I'm done with mine.
[214:32.89]Give me yours.
[214:35.55]He wasn't even kidding.
[214:36.25]He was like, he actually wanted me to give it to him.
[214:49.75]That's fucking based?
[214:52.69]What?
[214:55.47]He went right into the fire.
[215:00.64]Daisy Cutter acquired.
[215:02.16]What's that?
[215:06.72]We got more computer scientists.
[215:09.62]A USB 3.0 controller has a theoretical maximum transmission speed of 625 megabytes a second, which is capable of handling 34 cameras.
[215:19.01]Thank you.
[215:23.81]Automatically assuming that I bought the nice one that has USB 3.0 and not like 10 USB 2.0.
[215:30.55]So what does USB 2.0 have?
[215:32.13]Can somebody do that math for me, please?
[215:47.57]Don't use... The USB 2.0 controller has an effective throughput of 35 megabytes a second, being able to handle two cameras.
[216:13.83]Alright, but I always thought that you needed a 3.0 USB device to use a 3.0 capability.
[216:20.84]I can put a two- Didn't I have this problem like three months ago on the green screen?
[216:44.01]What is this thing I got?
[216:46.97]It's called daisy cutter.
[216:51.24]What is it?
[216:51.84]Wait a minute.
[216:56.70]Is it one of these?
[216:57.32]Oh shit, it is.
[217:01.17]Okay, cool.
[217:03.51]I'll try it.
[217:07.41]16 camera outputs.
[217:09.57]Would cause a high-end CPU to reach a temperature... I can't even read it.
[217:27.74]400 degrees Celsius.
[217:30.98]That's gotta be a troll, right?
[217:32.47]That's gotta be fucking made up.
[217:40.92]is hotter than your engine of your car.
[217:45.42]That's not even real.
[217:52.64]That's like a jet engine.
[217:54.69]40 Celsius is like the surface of Mercury.
[218:02.19]I don't think that you're accurate.
[218:21.86]Let's try it.
[218:22.28]What's it called?
[218:24.20]Daisy Cutter.
[218:25.08]Let's go.
[218:27.40]Ooh.
[218:29.70]Okay, that was awesome.
[218:31.67]Turn them into firewood.
[218:50.54]He was right about Mercury?
[218:52.63]Yeah, sorry.
[218:53.07]Somebody paid attention in fucking geology.
[218:56.69]Whatever class taught you this.
[219:08.72]I love it.
[219:15.57]Yeah.
[219:15.89]Study of rocks.
[219:16.55]Geology.
[219:17.07]Yeah.
[219:17.31]You understand that your planet is just a huge rock.
[219:21.33]We have gravity that spins it around the sun.
[219:22.98]They're just huge rocks with moss and water on them.
[219:28.36]Atari.
[219:30.02]A planetologist.
[219:33.48]Space.
[219:33.94]What are they called?
[219:34.40]Seriously, I'm being stupid right now.
[219:40.86]What is something that studies space?
[219:45.73]Astrologist?
[219:49.09]Is it astrology?
[219:49.93]Is it astronaut?
[219:52.96]No, not astrology.
[219:54.46]Yeah.
[220:02.38]Astronomy?
[220:04.68]What is astrology?
[220:10.50]It's not astrology?
[220:15.40]Astrology is a pseudo-science that claims divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative possessions of celestial objects.
[220:42.43]Alright, safety.
[220:44.57]What's my horoscope?
[220:45.51]Let's find out.
[220:46.03]I'll read it for you.
[220:53.32]Let's see what the horoscope is.
[220:56.87]I feel like if I go to one of these astrology websites, like, hey, what's my horoscope today?
[221:00.61]Like I'm literally about to download a bunch of fucking viruses.
[221:07.02]MSN.com?
[221:08.21]MSN still exists?
[221:09.19]I thought that got liquidated like 20 years ago.
[221:12.53]MSN?
[221:14.77]The Microsoft Network?
[221:20.64]Okay.
[221:22.23]Okay, here we go.
[221:23.47]For July 30th.
[221:25.25]Today.
[221:25.89]This is today.
[221:27.67]Everyone knows that nothing can stop you when you are determined to get something done.
[221:32.07]As long as other people are on your side today, you'll be amazed at all the things you are able to accomplish.
[221:38.01]But don't get too excited, because it's also time to take care of all those thankless tasks that no one seems to want to deal with.
[221:45.86]You may need other people's help to get them done.
[221:50.43]I didn't even... I don't think I read anything.
[221:54.95]I think that was just a full paragraph run-on sentence that said, do your best today.
[222:00.10]Alright, what about my love horoscope?
[222:06.64]You should be feeling good about yourself today, even though your tendency is towards too much self-criticism.
[222:13.92]You drive yourself very hard, and your ambitious nature can sometimes make life too stressful.
[222:19.34]Try to relax and enjoy the company of loved ones today.
[222:23.04]You'll be in the mood to see a movie, get together with friends, or even go out for a long hike today.
[222:31.81]AKA every single fucking activity that exists lumped into three different statements.
[222:41.04]Your head should soon clear and your emotions begin to stabilize.
[222:43.96]What about your career?
[222:51.31]You can find that a lot of issues are left up in the air today.
[222:54.35]You might finish a meeting with coworkers and think that everything has been settled, only to find out later that there are still many unanswered questions.
[223:02.62]Make lists of important issues that need resolution today and double-check the information that bosses or clients have conveyed to you.
[223:09.10]You may find that small errors are easy to overlook today, so pay attention.
[223:12.56]I don't have any coworkers.
[223:17.45]Alright, here we go.
[223:18.01]Finance.
[223:18.51]This is important.
[223:19.39]Come on, you know, it's like, ka-ching, you know what I mean?
[223:22.47]Today you might experience insights as to how to advance yourself in business.
[223:26.84]These could come your way through dreams.
[223:30.82]Sudden revelations, or perhaps even through visions.
[223:35.14]Why am I having, like, finance fever drug dream?
[223:40.18]Don't hesitate to put them into action simply because of the unorthodox way they came to you.
[223:45.78]Some of the most progressive and successful ideas have come to us because the inventor had a vivid dream.
[223:51.34]Write down your insights and go for it.
[223:52.93]Time to act on weird fucked up shit that happens in my dream tonight.
[224:08.94]Okay, hold on.
[224:09.34]This is for tomorrow.
[224:10.20]They already know.
[224:11.66]They already know tomorrow.
[224:15.49]This is tomorrow.
[224:16.97]A group with which you are affiliated might be all inflamed by supposed events and issues that could prove well to be nothing more than a rumor or gossip.
[224:28.52]If the discussion about it seems to be turning into an old-fashioned brouhaha, don't be afraid to stand up and suggest that someone be assigned to check the facts.
[224:37.92]All is done as it seems, and it's useless getting all excited over nothing.
[224:46.22]affiliated with might be inflamed is this is this because I didn't play the anime game like I'm not gonna play that anime game and tomorrow someone's gonna be really mad about it and it's gonna be a whole thing isn't it okay and finally my well-being let's see
[225:16.91]I'm getting a little inflamed.
[225:20.25]That's a weird way to say that.
[225:22.81]Inflamed?
[225:25.74]What is it, like a paper cut that you didn't put any fucking vasotracin on and it got infected?
[225:30.36]What are you talking about?
[225:31.42]Your well-being.
[225:33.98]Today you might want to go for a hike or a bike ride.
[225:36.38]You'll have a lot of energy, so you probably won't want to stay in the house all day.
[225:39.75]Try to get outside and do something athletic.
[225:42.21]You'll always enjoy being out in nature, so why not visit a park?
[225:46.51]Being outside for more than 30 seconds at a time just inflames me.
[226:13.07]This horoscope wants me dead.
[226:14.91]Why?
[226:32.29]Show Otto's horoscope.
[226:33.89]I don't know what Otto's birthday is.
[226:36.17]He was a rescue.
[226:36.85]I don't know his exact birthday.
[226:39.81]I'm not sure what his exact birthday is.
[226:42.37]But all I know is that he should probably wear a mask.
[226:47.55]Don't be fucking stupid going outside without a mask on.
[226:50.97]Don't be dumb.
[227:10.13]You guys know who that is?
[227:15.77]Oh, we got two guys.
[227:20.37]That wasn't Bernie?
[227:31.68]That was Dr. Fauci!
[227:49.74]everybody's burning alright I'm gonna lose if I don't can I get up there what does that mean what's it want me to do oh
[228:21.07]How do you like this game?
[228:23.35]I think it's fun.
[228:24.87]I think it's a fun game.
[228:25.69]I wish this game was, like, redone and made in the current time.
[228:31.93]And that there was more stuff to do.
[228:35.74]Oh, shit.
[228:36.34]That was... You're right.
[228:37.00]No, that actually was something that was on the list of promises.
[228:44.52]Another one.
[228:45.12]Done.
[229:06.22]Okay.
[229:19.07]Jerma, I've done some research.
[229:20.27]This is all capitals.
[229:21.19]Jerma, I've done research.
[229:23.85]A YouTube channel did a test with 15 webcams running on a single computer.
[229:27.91]One of the CPU cores combusted, causing the computer to go up in flames, reaching 368 degrees.
[229:33.17]If you do this, you'll cause a house fire.
[229:37.51]That's not even real.
[229:50.05]Why was it so specific?
[229:51.81]15 webcams?
[229:53.39]It can't be real.
[229:56.44]Is it real?
[230:00.40]Uh-oh.
[230:03.98]You guys are getting inflamed.
[230:10.85]Whoa, it's a huge giant enemy.
[230:15.77]Yeah, the thing.
[230:23.99]Dead.
[230:29.01]I need help.
[230:36.52]Alright, I'm going to go into Homer Simpson.
[230:38.90]Okay, here we go.
[230:41.97]In three, two, one.
[230:47.05]Hey.
[230:48.53]Or should I say, dough.
[231:15.93]I fucking, that was horrible.
[231:18.11]Wait, I haven't even done like one of these yet.
[231:21.37]Hey, everybody.
[231:29.25]Morse?
[231:29.67]Alright, I'll do Morse code.
[231:30.45]You ready?
[231:30.67]I'm going to turn this down because it's probably going to piss off a bunch of people.
[231:48.53]Maybe that was something maybe I said Wow, where is this guy get I'm got to wait for him to put his hands down He's being held hostage You just say about my wife
[232:23.11]Oh, come on.
[232:27.66]Come on.
[232:42.22]50 USB webcams.
[232:42.98]We're still on the webcam.
[232:52.33]It's been a long time.
[232:53.31]I've been away for so long that I forgot how funny this was.
[233:00.29]Somebody said, I think you just activated a sleeper agent.
[233:04.14]Kill it.
[233:25.04]They can kick the bomb over there.
[233:28.22]Oh.
[233:37.83]This game is a sleeper rager.
[233:39.27]Alright.
[233:41.81]Easy.
[233:44.16]Slow down.
[233:45.32]Slow it down.
[233:49.68]I'd like to see that person timed out to five minutes.
[233:52.63]That would be wicked funny, really relevant, and no one's allowed to be funnier than the screamer, otherwise they get the boot.
[234:03.23]I think it was dead.
[234:09.44]Okay.
[234:24.72]I wish there was a more efficient thing than the stomp, but it's just so good.
[234:28.57]It's so efficient.
[234:33.57]You can't ban us all.
[234:38.48]Yes, I can.
[234:41.30]I can, though.
[234:42.16]Like, I really can.
[234:43.26]It'd take a long time, but I could.
[234:45.32]I don't want to do that.
[234:47.80]And I like you.
[234:57.46]I'll get these webcams to work.
[234:58.96]Don't you worry.
[235:11.26]Wait, he's so angry.
[235:13.18]What's going on?
[235:17.56]I kind of feel bad for that door.
[235:39.10]There.
[235:40.42]Baraka?
[235:43.00]You know I used to be scared of Baraka when I was younger?
[235:48.17]By the way, I thought his name was Butterupka.
[235:50.85]That's the way the guy said it.
[235:53.69]Butterupka.
[235:55.69]I thought it was Butterupka.
[236:17.04]Butter up.
[236:18.02]I can't do it.
[236:19.58]Nobody can do that guy's voice.
[236:20.60]There's only three people in the world that can do it.
[236:22.26]Him.
[236:22.44]Two other people.
[236:25.46]They all do movie shit.
[236:45.06]I think I'm building up a little too much lactic acid in my right foot.
[236:49.56]Too many reps.
[236:50.64]I can't do it anymore.
[237:19.72]acid is, right?
[237:24.02]Oh, not lactating.
[237:26.05]Lactic acid.
[237:27.83]Lactic acid.
[237:34.13]Where's this door?
[237:54.23]What is this door?
[238:03.88]Wow.
[238:07.00]Galactic ass-eat.
[238:12.18]Yes.
[238:13.38]Uh, you did a- you sat- that took you a little while.
[238:16.86]You were sitting there thinking, okay, galactic acid.
[238:21.20]Okay, galactic acid.
[238:25.00]Come on.
[238:27.68]You spent a long time on that one.
[238:38.53]Over here?
[238:43.84]Am I nuts?
[238:45.32]Where's this door?
[238:46.92]There's supposed to be a lock on it.
[238:48.77]Am I nuts?

[282:25.73]Six?
[282:28.51]That's it.
[282:31.49]Wait, was I supposed to jump up the ladder?
[282:37.19]I don't think I was supposed to wait.
[282:47.01]My god.
[282:47.52]I'm not fucking around here.
[282:57.40]Stop, please!
[282:57.96]You dead?
[282:58.46]Short, uppercut, one.
[283:05.26]Do I even have that?
[283:09.08]I think I already have this.
[283:16.55]Oh, that's...
[283:27.71]That's it.
[283:30.77]I'm moving on.
[283:31.05]Damn.
[283:33.97]That was fun.
[283:34.49]I didn't expect the game to be that hard.
[283:38.81]I have it saved if I ever want to go back to it.
[283:42.89]Now it's time to play Resident Evil 4 for like 10 minutes.
[283:50.20]How am I going to do this?
[283:54.04]I'm going to do it like this.
[284:05.75]That soundtrack could use a little work.
[284:10.28]That's really the only complaint I have.
[284:11.44]And I wish there was a lock-on.
[284:13.66]It was really fun.
[284:18.56]No More Heroes 2 has been open the whole time.
[284:23.46]Yes, it's been open.
[284:30.27]Just paused at that screen.
[284:35.70]Alright, final promise of the evening.
[284:37.98]No, I'm not playing that Neptunia game.

[285:09.89]You're a liar.
[285:11.09]That's okay.
[285:12.03]I can lie about that one.
[285:26.77]Everybody's seen this cutscene.
[285:28.83]Who cares?
[285:29.25]I just need to shoot a guy.
[285:40.87]Alright, remember, the first is, and then that's it.
[285:45.57]I don't even have to kill the guy.

[286:58.82]Forastero means outsider.
[287:00.32]Okay, there you go.

[291:22.04]I'm going to die anyways.
[291:23.22]You think I'm going to die on easy in Resident Evil 4?
[291:28.54]If I die before the third... I will give 5,000 subs to the channel.
[291:55.11]Somebody say it.
[292:03.26]Somebody say it.
[292:08.62]Holy shit.
[292:09.04]They all said the same line.
[292:10.56]That's impossible.
[292:11.61]What?
[292:15.97]Why are you doing this?
[292:17.23]Come on.

[293:03.92]How many people am I triggering right now?
[293:08.54]Let's see how I'm using the weapon.
[293:10.33]Alright, if I don't kill this person, if I don't hit this person with a direct headshot, but not kill, if I do not hit this person directly in the head with a shotgun headshot, I will give 10,000 subs to the channel.
[293:33.12]It's so easy, but holy fuck.
[293:34.34]Oh my god, I fucking messed it up.
[293:47.30]Holy shit, this is too hard.
[293:48.36]This is actually hard to do.
[293:53.82]Thank god, holy shit.
[294:02.45]Like my credit card can't even charge that much money a day it would be impossible Oh
[294:16.21]Okay, do you see right there if that was still going on?
[294:18.57]I wouldn't have to give 10,000 subs.
[294:20.57]Do you see how that was kind of in the ear?
[294:21.73]Holy shit, I got her right in the nose, like right in the forehead.
[294:25.88]Holy shit.
[294:26.32]Imagine if they did that, that little shimmy.
[294:33.42]Stop gambling.
[294:34.36]That's not gambling.
[294:37.36]What do I get from that?
[294:39.32]That's just losing.
[294:50.70]Alright, I'm going to keep going.
[294:52.44]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[294:57.28]I probably am going to play Resident Evil 4 for real.
[295:00.47]Not fucking around.
[295:05.71]So, the end of the stream is still going to exist.
[295:11.58]But it's only going to be about five minutes while we just say goodbye.
[295:19.28]Are you going to play the Wii version?
[295:21.16]Isn't the Wii version the best version?
[295:29.64]Yes, it is.
[295:30.04]It definitely is the most fun.
[295:33.32]The one problem that I think I might have to be careful of with the Wii version is how you have to hold your arm up.
[295:40.23]think I might have to come up with some kind of solution for that because like holding my hand up and forward and tilting would I don't know that would be that might mess me up like my back like like shoulder chest bullshit we'll see but it is good to be back thank you there was a ton of people here and there was a shitload of fucking money a ton of people gave money a ton of people subbed
[296:04.15]It feels good to be back.
[296:06.20]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[296:08.06]It's going to be a mystery stream tomorrow.
[296:10.96]There's a ton of games that have come out and there's a ton of things that I still have.
[296:18.22]Let us say our goodbye.
[296:19.00]Is it going to work?
[296:27.46]I'm going to figure this out too.
[296:29.16]Why is it doing this?
[296:31.36]Stop it.
[296:34.32]Oh, it's a fake windowed mode.
[296:35.94]I forgot.
[296:40.32]Okay.
[296:40.62]Hey, there we are.
[296:43.90]So we are going to... What is this?

[296:58.28]Okay, let's put...
[297:04.09]The... Where's the... Where's my... There they are.
[297:10.75]Okay.
[297:11.03]Make sure they're still here.
[297:11.79]I'm going to run the credits.
[297:14.24]This could be very, very, very insane.
[297:16.22]This is going to be... What the fuck?
[297:18.38]Okay.
[297:18.72]So, hold on.
[297:19.26]This is... I got to... This is... There were about 2,600, 2,700 subscriptions today.
[297:29.82]Yesterday and the last five hours.
[297:33.42]This is going to be out of control.
[297:40.09]Thank you guys for just dumping that much money here.
[297:45.80]I really appreciate it.
[297:47.51]I'm sorry that I was gone for so long.
[297:50.56]And I know that I was doing it for health reasons and all that shit, but still.
[297:55.26]I really didn't want to be gone for that long.
[297:56.68]And it is, I'll be a little bit real with you, it is a little frustrating.
[298:00.78]Knowing that the entire reason why I left was to get this kind of figured out.
[298:04.81]And it's still happening.
[298:07.87]So, just kind of bear with me while I continue to try to figure out what's going on.
[298:16.39]I hope we're just going to keep doing it.
[298:18.53]We're just going to keep trying to figure out.
[298:19.81]I have doctor's appointments every week.
[298:22.89]I just need to know what's going on.
[298:25.11]And I need to start getting treated for it.
[298:28.05]So, here we go.
[298:29.99]Here come the subscriptions today.

[298:44.71]What?
[298:46.87]What do you mean?
[298:47.37]Uh... Right.
[298:59.50]This is not right.
[299:05.49]Let me see why this is doing this.
[299:10.83]Uh...

[299:28.91]This is gonna be eight hours of credits.
[299:32.59]Okay, let me try this again.
