[00:04.98]Hey!
[00:23.55]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Mogul Chess Boxing Championship presented by Fans League.
[00:32.09]My name is Jerma985.
[00:34.25]I will be your announcer tonight.
[00:36.29]Looks like we got some people here.
[00:38.23]Are they here?
[00:38.79]Are they here?
[00:43.62]Are they here?
[00:53.05]Are they over here as well?
[00:57.10]Welcome to beautiful Los Angeles, California.
[01:00.26]We're ready to get started.
[01:01.44]We have nine cards for you tonight.
[01:06.14]Everybody get prepared because we've got somebody to introduce.
[01:11.78]I don't know.
[01:12.46]Who could it be?
[01:13.79]Who could we be introducing to come give you some introductions?
[01:17.13]It's none other than Ludwig!
[01:19.47]Holy shit!
[01:22.10]Jerma, how are you?
[01:23.74]It's great to see you as always.
[01:25.64]Great job rolling out the crowd earlier.
[01:27.26]Appreciate that.
[01:28.10]They're ready.
[01:28.52]They're ready to go.
[01:29.28]Boxing event.
[01:30.76]Sounds kind of wild.
[01:31.98]Sounds wild to me.
[01:33.91]And Ludwig, I do have a very important question.
[01:36.35]Yeah.
[01:37.63]I don't see anything here.
[01:40.53]Jeremy.
[01:41.47]Well, I don't... Tell them, tell them.
[01:43.57]What's going on in the middle of the ring?
[01:45.43]Look up.
[01:46.45]Because we have the Fansly Sky Table.
[01:49.53]Holy smokes!
[01:50.87]This is where champions will be made, Jeremy.
[01:53.63]Right here.
[01:54.93]You got a TV and everything.
[01:57.23]Yeah, from the 90s.
[01:58.45]What are they doing here, Smash Brothers?
[02:00.68]Yeah, one of these old Super Smash Bros.
[02:02.18]One of these old TVs.
[02:03.98]Be multi-cast in not just English, but also French and Spanish.
[02:09.10]Let's go, let's hear it.
[02:11.92]Multicast!
[02:12.98]Multicast!
[02:14.18]You look like a ring announcer, the way you are bald and wearing a tuxedo.
[02:17.72]I feel like maybe I should have been.
[02:19.60]Why is Jerma down here?
[02:21.26]Come on, come on.
[02:21.88]This is his job.
[02:23.98]I couldn't find one.
[02:24.56]He couldn't help me with the bow tie.
[02:26.70]His bow tie's a clip-on.
[02:27.62]We won't tell that, though.
[02:29.02]Gentlemen, today we have two cards that you guys are going to.
[02:31.10]Our first card of the day.
[02:32.64]Jerma, please take it away.
[02:34.00]By the way, it was scary when that came down.
[02:36.15]Yeah, it can kill a man.
[02:37.29]Yeah, make sure you're in the sides.
[02:39.03]I'll be over here.
[02:41.62]Are you guys ready for the first card?
[02:45.90]Okay.
[02:46.50]Why don't we get started?
[02:48.78]The first card.
[02:49.96]We're going to play a video very quickly.
[02:53.29]For our first match of the night, let's get ready for the Fansley Walkout Jerma.
[02:59.35]Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for our first card?
[03:08.06]In the red corner, at 6'2", weighing in at 168 pounds, he is the crown saint!
[03:17.42]And in the blue corner, at 6'1", weighing in at 157 pounds, we have... Spud!
[03:29.59]Toussaint getting it done through New York in the building.
[03:32.25]Wow, that was something.
[03:33.85]New York in the building.
[03:35.15]New York in the building.
[03:36.55]We've got a belt here for you and everything.
[03:39.20]Step over here.
[03:40.02]On any block.
[03:40.82]It don't matter.
[03:41.38]Step over here to the camera.
[03:42.58]Step over here.
[03:43.38]Toussaint, take your belt.
[03:46.52]Can we get a declare of the winner?
[03:48.44]Let's go.
[03:51.82]Very, very impressive.
[03:55.32]Now, Toussaint, Toussaint, if I could catch you for one moment over here, Toussaint.
[03:59.83]That was a very, very impressive first round.
[04:03.26]From smash right into the boxing.
[04:06.56]What was going through your head during the smash portion, at least?
[04:10.19]My left hand felt like I couldn't move it at all.
[04:13.19]Yeah, so like my aerial dribble was really bad.
[04:15.71]But his sharking was amazing, so he capitalized really well.
[04:19.99]I mean, your boxing was incredibly impressive.
[04:22.93]Both of you should be very proud of yourselves.
[04:24.93]Fantastic performance by Two Saint.
[04:26.92]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of the first round, first card, Two Saint.
[04:31.82]And there it is.
[04:33.38]Let's do our Fansly walkout.
[04:36.25]Take it away, Jerma.
[04:38.31]Are you guys ready for the second Smash Boxing?
[04:42.89]In the red corner.
[04:43.99]This is just so cool.
[04:44.87]Weighing in at 168 pounds.
[04:47.64]At 5 foot 10.
[04:49.38]We have 69% fiction.
[04:54.00]And in the blue corner.
[04:56.66]At 168.8 pounds.
[04:59.08]At 6 feet even.
[05:01.42]Kalindi.
[05:03.73]Jeremy, please take it away.
[05:05.57]That was unbelievable.
[05:07.25]How do you feel?
[05:07.83]You look pretty tired.
[05:09.75]I'm feeling good.
[05:10.23]I can go a couple more rounds.
[05:11.29]You can go more?
[05:11.97]There we go.
[05:14.33]Give him another fight!
[05:15.37]Walk me through... Walk me through winning those Smash Bros.
[05:20.11]rounds and then having to get in the ring and fight.
[05:24.22]Walk... I'll get closer.
[05:25.50]It's not the volume, it's the clarity.
[05:27.40]Walk me through you fighting after winning Smash.
[05:31.20]Were you confident in Smash?
[05:32.42]More confident in boxing?
[05:33.48]As soon as the boxing starts, I forget that I was even playing Smash.
[05:36.78]Really?
[05:37.50]Same thing with Smash.
[05:38.45]I forgot I was even boxing.
[05:40.23]Wow!
[05:41.69]That's unbelievable.
[05:42.57]Well...
[05:43.92]You deserve it.
[05:44.68]There you go.
[05:45.30]Ladies and gentlemen, Fikshen, your winner.
[05:50.36]Excellent work.
[05:52.21]Fantastic.
[05:52.97]You owned it.
[05:55.39]Excellent work as well.
[05:56.59]It's a tiring thing.
[05:58.35]We'll go back to the booth here to get some more commentary on what just happened.
[06:01.87]Let's let Jerma take it away with our Fansly walkouts.
[06:05.88]Introducing first, in the now white corner, ladies and gentlemen, at 6'2", 194 pounds, give it up for Box Fox.
[06:16.93]And in the black corner, weighing in at 195 pounds, at 6'1", they call him Heavy Hands Stams.
[06:27.99]And let's hear from the crowd for these two fighters.
[06:30.91]Put your hands together.
[06:33.12]And let's toss it over to Jerma in the ring.
[06:36.16]What a fight!
[06:37.55]Oh, my goodness, what a fight!
[06:39.59]Foxbox, looked like you were down a little bit in the chest portion, but ended up coming back here.
[06:45.19]How do you feel?
[06:46.63]Yeah, I can barely talk with my mouthpiece on.
[06:50.44]He's got the mouthpiece still in!
[06:52.22]You want to take the mouthpiece out?
[06:53.82]Let's get the mouthpiece out.
[06:57.46]So we can hear.
[06:58.60]He's a sweet, earnest man.
[07:00.04]Yeah, I was told by some friends that do chess boxing that there's a special term for getting hit in the head and then blundering.
[07:08.85]I don't know the name of it, but if I didn't get hit in the head, I'd probably remember.
[07:15.95]On the second round of chess, my queen was in danger by a rook, and I was just like, this is fine.
[07:22.80]LAUGHTER
[07:25.61]Well, you put in an unbelievable performance.
[07:28.05]Congratulations, BoxBox.
[07:30.37]You won.
[07:31.40]There's your belt.
[07:32.78]And there's your winner.
[07:34.98]And again, it takes a lot of guts to be up here.
[07:38.70]Takes a lot of guts.
[07:40.00]Remember that.
[07:41.68]Unbelievable performance from both contestants.
[07:44.70]The fight led up by Chris Broad.
[07:47.25]Let's let Jerma, with the Fansley walkout, bring out our two fighters.
[07:53.61]Are you ready?
[07:55.54]Ladies and gentlemen, our first combatant in the white corner, weighing in at 180 pounds, 5'8", he is Mr. Affable himself, Chris Abroad in Japan!
[08:13.87]And in the black corner, weighing in at 185 pounds, at 5'11", we have Overtflow.
[08:24.15]And what a performance.
[08:25.95]Obviously, we have jermaOn stage.
[08:27.57]He's going to interview our winners and our players.
[08:30.46]Jerma, take it away.
[08:31.88]That was unbelievable.
[08:34.86]Overtflow, we got to talk.
[08:36.74]We got to talk, Overtflow.
[08:38.78]So you lost on time.
[08:40.52]I know, I know.
[08:41.58]What happened?
[08:42.34]You know, he's Mr. Affable, his calves are huge, and his chess game is even bigger.
[08:46.05]Absolutely amazing job.
[08:48.95]Very proud of him for getting in there, and I appreciate that he accepted a fight with me when it was supposed to be somebody else.
[08:54.93]I had a great time, and thank you, Ludwig.
[08:56.77]Thank you, Happy Punch.
[08:57.75]Thank you, Mogul Moves Boxing.
[09:01.01]You're the man.
[09:01.59]Appreciate you guys.
[09:02.66]You put on a hell of a match.
[09:05.92]Hell of a match.
[09:07.85]Hey, come on over here.
[09:11.09]So you lost to Queen.
[09:12.69]I did.
[09:13.65]And walk us through that.
[09:15.53]The moment I lost to Queen, I was like, I'm done.
[09:17.55]I fucked it, right?
[09:19.05]Because PJ's punches were so much stronger than mine, so much better at boxing than I am.
[09:24.58]And I thought, straight off that first round, I was like, if I have to go two more rounds, I'm fucked.
[09:30.35]So to get to that last round of chess, I knew I had an extra minute.
[09:33.98]I thought I could win it.
[09:35.70]Fuck me, that was close, though.
[09:36.88]That was, like, the full fucking experience, but thank you so much to Nicolas Patas, my coach, to Ryosuke back home as well, to my friends, family, viewers for supporting me, and for Sharla for putting up with me.
[09:49.68]Thank you.
[09:51.96]Well, you guys went all the way.
[09:53.38]What an unbelievable match.
[09:55.30]Give it up for your winner, Chris Abram in Japan.
[10:04.13]There he is, raising the bell to 300,000 online, thousands in person.
[10:10.09]He had a journey, a goal.
[10:11.81]Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for our Fansley player introductions.
[10:17.42]Coming in first, in the white corner, weighing in at 163 pounds, at 5'9".
[10:21.40]Ladies and gentlemen...
[10:27.92]Toph!
[10:28.82]And in the black corner, weighing in at 165 pounds, at 5'7", the DreamHack Dallas 2019 World Champion, Dignitas Huggs!
[10:43.37]And of course, now we have to let Jerma talk to our competitors.
[10:46.03]Take it away, Jerma.
[10:48.43]Toph, come on over here, Toph.
[10:50.33]So...
[10:51.60]During that first round, I see you got a little bit of blood going on the nose here.
[10:55.16]How do you feel?
[10:56.30]Actually, you wouldn't believe it.
[10:57.62]It feels amazing.
[10:58.72]It's good.
[10:59.28]I love that energy.
[11:02.04]Let's give it up.
[11:03.28]Give it up.
[11:04.59]Give it up.
[11:05.85]That was the first thing I realized, man.
[11:07.65]My first sparring session, like, it don't hurt that bad.
[11:11.01]It feels good.
[11:12.71]Well, the energy is there, and the heart is there, too.
[11:15.39]Excellent job, Toph.
[11:17.29]Let's go ahead and announce the winner.
[11:19.66]Your winner is Huggs!
[11:23.72]Nice voice crack!
[11:26.22]Huggs!
[11:28.20]Now I'm going to scooch over this way because we have to talk to you.
[11:32.58]Because that was very impressive, very quick.
[11:36.96]Thank you.
[11:37.34]First, I want to shout out my amazing opponent.
[11:40.33]I know he fucking grinds, so I knew that I had to put everything into it to even be in the ring with him, to be on the board with him.
[11:46.13]I know how much he grinds, so nothing but respect for you, Tobi.
[11:49.67]Unbelievable.
[11:50.47]You deserve it.
[11:51.27]Take the belt.
[11:52.83]Pound it.
[11:54.19]Give it up for these two.
[11:57.95]Congratulations.
[11:59.01]Good fight.
[12:00.43]Let's go back to the desk for our Fansly walkouts.
[12:04.06]Take it away, Jerma.
[12:07.02]Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for our sixth fight?
[12:11.08]Fighting out of the white corner at six foot even, weighing 183 pounds.
[12:15.04]Give it up for...
[12:19.46]Aman!
[12:20.66]And fighting under the black corner, at 5'11", weighing 187 pounds, Lawrence the Immortal, Trent!
[12:29.97]Let's go to Jerma in the ring for the interview and the winner.
[12:35.43]So, that was a crazy one, but your winner by TKO, Aman!
[12:43.54]Ahmaud Hamilton, the Grandmaster, takes it down.
[12:48.32]The two hug it out.
[12:49.18]Lawrence.
[12:50.72]Lawrence, come on over here, if you will.
[12:52.78]You can have a few words, I'm sure.
[12:54.08]Now, Lawrence, you seem pretty upset about that last... I'm not hurt enough.
[12:58.12]It's ridiculous.
[12:59.34]I mean, come on.
[13:01.74]Like, if I'm on the floor, fine.
[13:04.04]If I'm coherent, I can talk, my eyes are fine.
[13:08.48]I don't get the stoppage.
[13:10.24]Like, what's going on?
[13:12.04]Unfortunately, it's the ref's decision to stop the match, which is unfortunate, but you did fight a hell of a fight.
[13:18.95]I didn't.
[13:19.37]We barely made round one.
[13:20.45]I'm disappointed, you know?
[13:22.63]Well, let's get Amon over here if we could.
[13:25.67]Amon, congratulations again.
[13:29.15]Quick fight, but it was a good fight.
[13:31.15]I did it.
[13:31.71]How do you feel about the chest portion?
[13:33.28]Everyone thought that that was going to be a pretty evenly matched potentially.
[13:37.56]Was there a chest portion?
[13:47.99]How do you feel about the boxing then?
[13:50.17]I feel proud.
[13:50.79]I put in the work and it showed.
[13:53.89]You put on a hell of a show.
[13:55.15]Came out aggressive.
[13:56.62]Came out ready to fight.
[13:59.24]And he's your winner.
[14:00.86]Aman.
[14:02.30]Your winner.
[14:03.66]Let's hear it for Shasha Brown.
[14:04.92]We're proud.
[14:06.04]Well, hey, we won't stall you guys any longer.
[14:08.10]Let's kick it over to Jerma with our Fansly Walkouts.
[14:11.35]Jerma, take it away.
[14:13.69]Gonna need you to get loud for this one.
[14:15.73]Fighting out of the white corner, at 5'6", weighing 135 pounds, Andrea Botez!
[14:26.90]And her opponent, fighting out of the black corner, at 5'5", weighing 125 pounds,
[14:37.59]My head hurts from screaming.
[14:39.19]I don't know about you guys.
[14:40.13]God.
[14:40.65]My God, what a freaking matchup.
[14:43.01]That was so much fun to watch.
[14:44.57]Alright, let's kick it over to Jerma, who's going to make the announcement.
[14:53.12]Alright, wow.
[14:55.76]That's all I can say right now is wow.
[14:58.98]That was an unbelievable contest.
[15:01.74]But let's decide, let's show the winner first, right?
[15:06.69]before we talk about what just actually happened.
[15:13.71]I think I almost had a heart attack.
[15:19.95]And your winner, by checkmate, Dino!
[15:23.26]Come on!
[15:23.62]Come on!
[15:34.38]Come on!
[15:37.06]Now let's, let's, Andrea, come on over here.
[15:42.45]Andrea, boxing, absolutely phenomenal boxing.
[15:47.27]You knew you had the checkmate coming.
[15:50.59]I tried to stall, but unfortunately, I thought this was a chess boxing match.
[15:54.89]It felt more like hide and seek.
[16:01.00]Well, you put up a hell of a fight.
[16:02.68]Anything else you'd like to say before we turn it over to Dina?
[16:05.96]Dina, the better chess player won.
[16:07.62]Congratulations.
[16:12.07]Now, Dina, Dina, turn this way for me, if you would.
[16:16.27]You knew you were potentially up against that boxing, trying to maybe do a little bit of dodging and weaving.
[16:22.26]You knew you had the checkmate.
[16:23.56]Tell us about it.
[16:24.94]So, to be completely honest with you, I think I was subjective, and I knew that Andrea had a great cardio, and I knew she was training way harder than me in boxing, so I assumed her being a better boxer, and my goal was to show that I can also box.
[16:44.47]I trained every day ever since I got the invitation, and once again, I esteemed her to be a better boxer, and my goal was to...
[16:55.20]to show the crowd that I can also box and obviously win on the chessboard.
[17:02.75]It happened this way and I still can't believe it.
[17:06.90]I mean, you two put on an unbelievable show.
[17:10.69]Everybody was standing.
[17:12.43]Sorry, I also want to thank my coach, Brandon, as well as Temple No More Out in Paris, a place where I used to box every day, as well as Immortal Game, my sponsor.
[17:23.28]Without you guys and your support, this wouldn't be possible.
[17:25.66]Thank you so much.
[17:26.66]And of course...
[17:29.06]And of course, huge thanks to my opponent, who actually really motivated me for this fight, and that has been an absolute pleasure to be fighting against you, Andrea.
[17:41.16]This is yours.
[17:42.66]Your winner, Dina!
[17:45.46]Give it up!
[17:46.11]Give it up!
[17:46.79]Give it up!
[17:47.79]That was an unbelievable match for both of them.
[17:51.65]Should we kick it over to Jerma?
[17:53.15]Let's get it to Jerma to get these two competitors in the ring in the fight underway.
[18:00.29]Are you ready?
[18:02.49]Ladies and gentlemen, fighting out of the white corner, at 5'11", 177 pounds, he is... Meth!
[18:10.08]And his opponent, fighting out of the black corner, at 165 pounds, standing at 5'9",
[18:25.28]Without further ado, let's kick it over to the myth, the man, the legend, Sherma985.
[18:32.97]Alright.
[18:34.77]So, ladies and gentlemen, in the seventh round, by decision of timeout in chess, your winner, Myth!
[18:46.92]A deserved win, both on the board and in the boxing ring.
[18:51.94]Yeah, all I can say about this is they need to play less chess.
[18:54.80]They need to just box.
[18:55.88]They got to get in there.
[18:56.98]Come over here for a second here.
[18:58.94]Journeys, I mean, I mean, probably the best chess of the entire year.
[19:03.20]We don't we don't have to talk about that.
[19:04.56]Let's talk about the technical boxing, because that was impressive.
[19:08.69]Yeah, I had to pee the whole time.
[19:11.69]Do you think that helped?
[19:13.37]Yeah, it might have helped.
[19:14.77]But, you know,
[19:16.75]It kind of hurt.
[19:18.65]When was the last time you urinated?
[19:20.85]What?
[19:21.33]When was the last time you urinated?
[19:22.51]They didn't have bathrooms in the back, so I couldn't pee the whole time.
[19:26.03]We have bathrooms.
[19:26.61]Fake news.
[19:28.40]That's what a Gatorade bottle is for.
[19:30.64]And I had a tummy ache, too, so... He's got the excuses lined up.
[19:35.22]Well, a hell of a technical boxing match.
[19:37.26]You did a great job, although it goes to decision with the time running out.
[19:42.47]Hell of a job.
[19:43.07]If you have anything else to say.
[19:44.39]I didn't get knocked out this time.
[19:45.69]It was kind of cool.
[19:46.65]I like that.
[19:47.91]Yeah.
[19:48.25]That's true.
[19:48.67]He's damn right.
[19:49.33]He's damn right.
[19:50.21]His last fight was a knockout within 30, 40 seconds.
[19:52.19]Vince, come over here.
[19:53.67]This one, he proved his weight.
[19:55.25]You were the favorite.
[19:57.01]So how does it feel going into this with a favorite needing to prove what you're capable of?
[20:02.67]I think so.
[20:03.17]It was a lot of fun overall.
[20:05.25]Yeah, I just had a really good time.
[20:07.29]And shout out to everybody that voted for me.
[20:09.23]That's fucking sick.
[20:10.63]Thank you.
[20:12.51]But yeah, and then also shout out to Churblis.
[20:14.23]He like came in.
[20:14.95]This fight wouldn't be possible if he didn't step up to the plate and get into the fucking ring.
[20:19.01]And he's the man of the arena.
[20:19.99]So big shout out to him.
[20:20.81]Round of applause to Churblis.
[20:22.93]Myth, you're a class act.
[20:24.47]And you get this belt.
[20:25.91]Give it up for your winner, Myth.
[20:28.59]Are you ready for the main event?
[20:35.24]Louder than that!
[20:36.24]Louder than that!
[20:37.10]This is your main event!
[20:40.70]Let's go!
[20:41.60]Go!
[20:42.04]Go!
[20:42.46]Go!
[20:42.92]Go!
[20:43.34]And his opponent, fighting out of the black corner, at 5'7", weighing 141 pounds, Disguised Toast!
[20:54.48]Kick it over to our ring announcer, Jerma, before our special Cash App surprise.
[21:02.25]Wow!
[21:03.91]That was a slobber knocker, as they say.
[21:08.14]Aggressive, big brain.
[21:11.76]Unbelievable, but in the very end, let's get the decision here.
[21:19.35]Ladies and gentlemen, are we gonna move this away?
[21:22.23]Let's go ahead and do it right now.
[21:25.69]Your winner, by checkmate,
[21:31.09]by Checkmate, Disguised Toes!
[21:35.74]...encapsulated.
[21:37.12]Absolutely great effort by both fighters.
[21:40.65]Obviously a lot of love and respect between the two.
[21:44.11]I would, but I have a chest hole, plus, you know, I haven't trained boxing.
[21:47.50]I had to commentate.
[21:48.36]I'm tired.
[21:48.96]It's... Ludwig, Ludwig, hold on.
[21:51.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:52.00]Hold on a second.
[21:53.30]Hold on a second right now.
[21:55.02]Just give me one moment, please.
[21:57.32]This is Mogul Chess Boxing Championship.
[22:00.65]Yeah, so what?
[22:01.53]Who gives a shit about the name?
[22:03.01]I made it up yesterday.
[22:04.61]You don't think that Ludwig should probably fight tonight?
[22:08.45]What?
[22:10.41]Yeah!
[22:12.39]No.
[22:13.68]Uh, hold on a minute.
[22:15.28]Do you think that Ludwig should fight in this ring right now?
[22:23.93]No!
[22:24.79]No!
[22:24.97]No!
[22:25.33]No!
[22:25.93]No!
[22:26.33]No!
[22:27.05]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, chill, chill, chill.
[22:30.75]Jerma, Jerma, hey, love that dollhouse thing you did?
[22:33.85]Could you shut the fuck up?
[22:34.99]I haven't trained boxing.
[22:36.09]I don't know how to fight.
[22:37.59]Could I, could I see a show of hands on who would like to fight him?
[22:45.57]Are there any children in the crowd?
[22:47.87]Raise your hands.
[22:50.49]Do you want to go?
[22:53.85]I don't know how to box.
[22:54.83]They don't know how to box.
[22:55.57]You don't have to box.
[22:57.57]You don't have to box at all.
[22:59.07]You can do something completely different.
[23:01.23]Like what?
[23:02.39]I don't know.
[23:02.95]You get a table in here and maybe get somebody to go on the other side of the table and do a little bit of a slap boxing.
[23:11.11]Slap boxing?
[23:15.87]a little whack a little whack I'm not russian I'm not built for that just stay right here what is about to happen is this this really happening this is really about to go down Jerma pick me Jerma Jerma you don't have to do this you have to do this you have to do this no you guys don't want to fight me you don't want to fight me I I I'm very strong hey very strong I think I might have found somebody right over here is that c-dog
[23:45.52]What?
[23:48.74]Are you in?
[23:49.40]You in?
[23:53.39]I think it's time to embarrass you in your own event.
[23:57.63]Oh, it's interesting.
[23:58.49]A table just showed up right in the middle of the ring.
[24:00.85]What the heck happened?
[24:02.11]How?
[24:03.15]How does it work?
[24:04.35]Well, from my understanding is you're going to stand on one side.
[24:09.38]C-Dawg's going to stand on the other side.
[24:11.50]Oh my goodness, I almost went over.
[24:13.78]Hopefully there's more room.
[24:15.48]And you're going to take turns slapping each other in the gosh darn face.
[24:19.94]He's going to run out of time at this rate.
[24:21.04]Ludwig, five seconds, I believe, on the clock.
[24:22.50]Four, three, two, one.
[24:25.88]Oh, my gosh.
[24:26.78]And Ludwig loses.
[24:28.49]Ludwig has lost on time.
[24:30.09]Yeah, that's personal, man.
[24:32.83]A fraction, a fraction of time you lose.
[24:36.89]Unfortunately.
[24:39.27]Both mics.
[24:40.45]Jerma.
[24:41.94]Just give me the fucking bell.
[24:43.10]I paid 1.5 mil for this.
[24:44.74]Just give me the fucking bell.
[24:45.82]And your winner... Cedar!
[24:53.96]Hold it high, hold it high, hold it high.
