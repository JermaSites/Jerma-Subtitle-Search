[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]No, no, no, no, no.
[00:21.92]Hey, everybody.
[00:22.48]We're back, and it's time for Dota Fortress 2.
[00:25.36]It's going to be awesome.
[00:28.07]On the couch joining me right now, the banana man, Mr. Slin.
[00:32.32]I think enough bananas have been eaten on this stream.
[00:34.10]It was making me uncomfortable.
[00:35.46]I was sitting over there.
[00:36.20]And I love bananas.
[00:36.73]I was like, what's going on over here?
[00:38.01]Yeah, it was weird.
[00:38.39]And then Admirable, who did eat an entire apple off camera.
[00:41.57]So he does it in his personal life.
[00:43.10]I've eaten many apples.
[00:44.26]And we're just going to get right into Dota Fortress 2.
[00:46.42]We've got nerds over here that may or may not be picked.
[00:48.53]It depends on if Star and Jerma want to pick them.
[00:51.09]And we're going to get right to it.
[00:52.13]So we're going to play three games.
[00:53.34]I think the first two are going to be standard 6v6.
[00:55.72]We did it last year.
[00:56.54]I'm still a little confused as to all the details.
[00:59.11]Star and Jerma, I think next year will...
[01:00.73]I'm not confused on any of the details.
[01:02.87]Shamba had lectured them.
[01:03.85]They know.
[01:04.29]I'm always confused.
[01:05.88]Are you guys ready to go?
[01:07.44]Pick some teams.
[01:08.40]We're ready to go.
[01:09.34]I'm so ready.
[01:10.34]We have the first two matches are 6v6.
[01:13.78]The third one is going to be 8v8 just because there's that many people.
[01:16.50]First map is Badlands.
[01:19.21]And we're, you know, people want to see Jerma versus Star, but we're trash at the game.
[01:25.19]So we're going to just be kings and make people play for us.
[01:28.10]Like, they're our little pawns.
[01:30.72]Yeah, I'm ready to rock.
[01:33.42]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[01:34.64]This should be a lot of fun.
[01:35.30]This is one of the best events every time.
[01:37.21]Last time we did it was the first year we did it, so this is the second time around.
[01:39.51]I think this is where Robin Walker had his hacked rocket launcher.
[01:44.62]Wow, spoilers for watch backers.
[01:46.84]Sorry.
[01:47.46]It's just a super cool idea.
[01:49.83]Mini gun, rocket launcher, nuclear bomb, projector thing.
[01:53.89]I think it was on my team and we still didn't win.
[01:56.62]Robin Walker has never won.
[01:58.68]He always cheats and never wins.
[02:01.46]That's a spoiler for Playbackers.
[02:03.04]So the way this is looking, I'm going to get the first ban.
[02:06.57]And I just... Yeah, let's pass it over to the screen.
[02:11.07]Here's the full screen.
[02:13.47]Oh, yeah.
[02:15.36]Dude, look at that.
[02:16.40]Oh, just gazing.
[02:17.92]I'm banning, Slim.
[02:18.86]You're not playing.
[02:21.08]That's rough.
[02:23.02]Rest in peace.
[02:25.36]That was quick, man!
[02:27.46]I just sat down and finished!
[02:29.57]He actually named me first thing!
[02:31.17]Aw, well, alright.
[02:35.09]That's your first ban.
[02:37.06]And my first ban is gonna be... Max is my first ban.
[02:42.87]Don't want snipers on the Badlands.
[02:47.05]Second ban, second ban...
[02:51.09]Flynn isn't up there again.
[02:54.16]I'm going to ban Clockwork.
[03:00.17]Ooh.
[03:00.87]See that?
[03:01.67]Now you're talking.
[03:02.89]Now you're speaking the language.
[03:04.41]You see the deep strategy, the deep, deep set strategy if you really want to win.
[03:08.00]I was thinking way too hard, and I went too hard last year.
[03:10.42]You ban Clockwork twice, the third map is Viaduct.
[03:12.87]You win no matter who you pick if you get Clockwork.
[03:14.95]But we're not going that deep this time.
[03:18.80]Okay.
[03:20.22]My second ban is going to be Bloodsire.
[03:25.83]No snipers.
[03:27.41]He's over there sitting in the chair going, what the heck?
[03:31.56]Jeremy, you also get first pick on this one.
[03:33.26]I do get first pick.
[03:34.78]My first pick.
[03:37.19]Here we go.
[03:37.75]Ladies and gentlemen, the first picker that's going to be Malem.
[03:42.43]Mela first pick.
[03:44.79]You know, just to counter, just to like, because no matter what team Mela's on, I need to pick Tag on the other team so they can look across monitors and every time Tag gets the luckiest shot of his life, they can like have that moment and have Mela feel bad about it.
[04:00.57]Well, I think that might have been a huge mistake because my second pick is going to be the Fragile.
[04:09.39]The Fragile.
[04:11.26]Man, damn.
[04:13.90]Hopefully he wasn't banned.
[04:16.38]If only you didn't ban Selene, you could have.
[04:21.83]I think we're fiddling with the graphics here, but yeah, so Melo's on Jerma's team and Fragile as well.
[04:27.87]Yeah, sorry if we're going too fast here.
[04:30.38]I think you're fine.
[04:31.00]This is the right pace.
[04:32.24]I think that they're having a little issue at the controls here.
[04:38.35]Yep, tag should be on Ster's team.
[04:43.24]Oh, okay.
[04:44.54]We're just going to send them back to the player pool.
[04:46.44]Those guys are just joining us, by the way.
[04:47.62]These are some of the best players in North America.
[04:49.96]I'm just looking at the names.
[04:50.99]I love it.
[04:51.51]There's so many old-school names and, of course, some Highlander players as well, 6v6 players.
[04:56.77]There is so much talent represented on here.
[04:59.14]Everyone going, oh, stars.
[05:00.96]God, I'm not on anyone on this list's radar.
[05:04.24]So that's why I have to be the king.
[05:06.20]They're the pawns.
[05:07.50]And me in this situation, I'm on a separate island on a different planet in another galaxy.
[05:12.51]Alright, so it looks like they've got the team set up right.
[05:15.49]Mela and the Fragile on one team, and then Tag by himself with the sword on the blue team.
[05:21.34]So, Ster, you are ready to go.
[05:22.49]I am ready to, you know,
[05:28.42]It's a tough day to not double up on soldiers.
[05:32.73]I'm getting Tyrone.
[05:37.78]Some wang.
[05:38.88]Well, everyone needs some wang in their life.
[05:42.06]Two soldiers, huh?
[05:45.87]Okay.
[05:46.98]Well, I need a scout.
[05:49.88]I need a scout.
[05:51.19]Who's the scout?
[05:52.79]Who's the scout?
[05:53.85]By the way, anyone who's watching, there is a class limit of two.
[05:57.31]You can only have one medic, but we can have two Demoman.
[06:00.84]We can have two of anything.
[06:02.38]Get two of anything else.
[06:07.68]I'm going to have to go with Shrugger as my scout.
[06:14.35]Nice.
[06:14.61]Good choice.
[06:16.97]Didn't Trugger win MGE?
[06:18.37]Trugger won MGE.
[06:19.47]Can't go wrong with him.
[06:20.57]He's very, very good.
[06:21.67]All the scouts are good.
[06:23.32]Well, didn't MGE, Mike, win MGE?
[06:25.92]Oh, yeah, he won.
[06:26.84]Oh, because he won Lapo.
[06:29.02]Getting second place is like, yeah, he won.
[06:33.59]Um... You know what?
[06:35.97]You want to get a scout?
[06:39.45]Uh... Nah, give me Kydus.
[06:44.63]Hmm.
[06:46.41]Well, isn't that interesting?
[06:50.25]So now that makes that you've got two.
[06:52.36]You don't have a medic yet.
[06:54.26]Yeah, I can wait.
[06:54.78]You already have one.
[06:55.50]You're not going to pick another one.
[06:56.70]I know.
[06:57.12]I'm just going through.
[06:58.25]Are there second rounds of bans in this, or no?
[07:01.37]No, we're still in the bans.
[07:02.41]No, just picks.
[07:03.05]Okay, good.
[07:04.51]I ban those two snipers because I want pretzel on this team, so pretzel heavy is my next pick.
[07:09.60]Oh.
[07:11.08]I like how he went for the meta right there.
[07:12.71]He's like, ban all the snipers, get the goodies.
[07:14.75]I was already thinking, you know what this team needs?
[07:18.18]You know what Badlands needs?
[07:20.04]I watched Stabby Stabby not do so well on his sixes Badlands.
[07:23.43]I have to fix Stabby.
[07:24.75]I have to.
[07:26.48]it's it's rough as a sixes spy but like if there's a heavy I'm all in on it yeah yeah last time Jim I got stabby and uh that was his first pick so that was my following to the uh second fourth pick but that's yeah that might be a major mistake he might be the sleeper pick that started he's incredibly good all you purists out there going off spy on a sixes team and all have like
[07:47.27]This isn't your 6v6 pro league.
[07:50.51]You're countering the heaviest.
[07:53.40]You guys are getting dealt some weird cards.
[07:55.36]How are you going to deal with it?
[07:56.66]I want to see the strats.
[08:00.57]My next pick is going to be Duatna on demo.
[08:03.33]Duatna.
[08:05.65]World champion recently at August I-55.
[08:11.28]I got to say, Jerma's team looks really good.
[08:14.49]Looks really, really good.
[08:15.55]I got to say, Jerma's team looks like it's pretty good.
[08:24.36]You got Tyrone though, Star.
[08:25.92]Yeah, I'm going to take a second to figure this out here.
[08:28.64]I'm just going to grab the Medic for now and grab Pure.
[08:33.81]Big Brad, TF2 legend.
[08:36.23]Nice.
[08:36.69]He can handle his weirdness.
[08:38.34]He'll metagame Star's team out of this.
[08:41.50]This is Badlands, right?
[08:43.18]Yep.
[08:44.88]Well, my final pick, good luck capping, it's going to be Jordan on Engineer.
[08:50.85]Wow.
[08:52.37]I was joking before this.
[08:55.05]You pick two engies, two demos, no one wants to watch, but boy would something not happen.
[09:02.90]Good thing I only have one of each.
[09:06.15]You know what, you have a head, like, I was thinking maybe I need to get a scout.
[09:10.63]Maybe this team is, you know, looking kind of slow, but I got the soldiers.
[09:13.43]You got a heavy.
[09:14.22]You're going to be dragging that heavy and that engineer across the field.
[09:17.22]I am not even going to go into the realm of scouts.
[09:22.98]You know, no scout?
[09:24.77]No, scout... Scouts are for capping points, and none of... I think I have to, though.
[09:34.33]I'm looking at the list.
[09:35.44]I think I'm pretty locked into...
[09:39.16]Well, remember, all the classes are limited to two.
[09:42.49]And if you're not going to go with Scouts, you could pick a Demoman, because Demoman are good against heavies and engineers.
[09:46.62]Why don't you let him figure it out, Slynn?
[09:48.10]I'm just giving you some hints.
[09:49.18]No, no, no, no.
[09:50.42]Give me suggestions.
[09:51.23]I'm just discussing it here.
[09:52.41]You have two geniuses over here.
[09:53.97]Just throwing out ideas, you know?
[09:55.85]Maybe back off a little bit, alright?
[09:58.44]Star knows what he's doing.
[10:00.10]I do know what I'm doing.
[10:01.42]I do.
[10:02.27]mommy mommy I know I'm picking smack up I feel like smack oh my smack is in the running here I didn't even see him oh boy wow two demos required a lot of heels but they have brad the god of medic
[10:20.47]Alright, Star, Jerma, what do you think of your two teams?
[10:23.50]I can hear someone laughing, saying this is the worst team.
[10:27.79]That's Brad Vincent being salty over there.
[10:30.32]I don't know.
[10:30.80]Is it over there?
[10:33.19]Was it over there?
[10:36.34]There is a gentleman's agreement that we have to have, you know, non-standard Sixers classes on a team.
[10:44.41]I just want to see how they can handle this.
[10:46.54]They're all good players.
[10:47.54]They should be able to adapt.
[10:49.10]Banny gets up and walks out, not getting picked or banned.
[10:52.61]He might have just quit TF2.
[10:54.42]He's so offended, he just laughed, you know?
[10:58.75]Alright.
[10:59.23]Well, we're going to get in the server.
[11:00.99]Star, Jerma, what do you guys think?
[11:02.18]Are you happy with your teams?
[11:03.98]No.
[11:05.00]I made some mistakes.
[11:07.27]I think I am extremely happy.
[11:08.96]I think I'm ready.
[11:09.96]I'm ready to... I told you I watched the tapes.
[11:13.67]Listen, here's the situation.
[11:15.94]I have faith in my team.
[11:17.18]I picked them for a reason.
[11:18.24]I think two demos, two demos, and Stabby is the unknown.
[11:23.97]Did you see him in the pub a moment ago?
[11:26.25]He is on point right now, so that's actually not a bad statement.
[11:32.32]And picking a spy into an NG, I mean, he's got plenty of stuff to do.
[11:35.70]Did you see Tag eat that banana?
[11:37.12]Were you there when Tag ate that banana?
[11:38.82]I unfortunately was like 10 feet away.
[11:40.71]It was...
[11:42.07]Yeah, Bear and I were sitting next to each other going, uh... What are we doing?
[11:45.77]For the kids.
[11:46.25]Did we lose the stream?
[11:47.54]That was good.
[11:48.85]Nope.
[11:49.67]I think people are getting into the game here.
[11:51.53]So I'm not sure if we're going to keep Star and Jerma in during whatever we're going to be doing here on the couch.
[11:56.84]I'm not sure.
[11:57.78]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[11:58.60]I'm totally down for that.
[11:59.32]I don't know.
[11:59.76]I didn't see Baron and Myrable be casting last year.
[12:01.92]We're going to try to cast this mess, but I think we're just going to have a little bit of fun with it.
[12:06.19]And yes, it's going to be kind of a best of three here.
[12:08.21]So we've got some money on the line.
[12:09.81]Myrable and I have put $100 down.
[12:11.71]So wait, whose team do I have?
[12:13.01]Star's?
[12:13.85]Oh.
[12:15.28]Although my PayPal's broken, I can't pay anyway.
[12:18.02]Yeah.
[12:18.36]Well, I think I might be paying.
[12:19.70]I don't know.
[12:20.14]I think Star's team's got a chance, but it's going to have to be some good smart healing because you have a lot of people to heal.
[12:26.07]Demos need healing.
[12:26.85]Well, yeah, this is 6v6, but it's not the traditional 6v6.
[12:29.37]I mean, we have two Demoman on one team, and the other team, you're going to have an NG heavy.
[12:32.97]It's the unlock situation.
[12:34.39]It's on Badlands.
[12:35.98]It's on Badlands.
[12:36.88]It's a classic map.
[12:37.54]Everyone's going to know it.
[12:38.34]Everyone's going to know it, but it's going to play a lot more like I'm a small pub.
[12:42.19]But with calls.
[12:43.21]Everyone is so talented, though.
[12:44.71]Yeah, we'll see.
[12:45.78]It's going to be fun.
[12:47.02]I'm excited to see it.
[12:49.08]How many times have we played Badlands in this game?
[12:51.52]6v6.
[12:52.13]A few million.
[12:53.45]I don't know if we've ever seen it like this.
[12:55.53]I think the rules are you're not allowed to off-class, you're not allowed to switch off.
[12:58.71]No, they have to stay on their class all the time.
[13:00.26]But they can switch their loadouts.
[13:01.80]I don't know if we'll see a mini century, and if we do, how mad people will get.
[13:04.91]Star's team has a lot of mobility.
[13:05.85]He's got two soldiers and two Demoman.
[13:07.93]So he's got a lot of mobility.
[13:08.78]Even if he didn't pick scouts, he's got a lot of moving around going there.
[13:10.74]But Jerma went the other way.
[13:12.08]He went very defensive, right?
[13:13.63]Heavy, Engineer.
[13:14.91]He's going to play it slow.
[13:16.49]But we'll see who wins, the turtle or the hare.
[13:20.36]Got to bag the two demo men.
[13:22.13]We could even throw in two demo nights there and make things interesting.
[13:25.85]I'm guessing one of them will because you're going to have to divvy up the heels.
[13:28.94]By the way, we are still taking your donations.
[13:30.96]We're marching close.
[13:31.90]We are $5,800 away from breaking two.
[13:36.41]hundred thousand dollars which is absolutely incredible I have a feeling we're gonna get there at some point during uh the Dota fortress I'd be shocked if we didn't um so keep the donations coming we don't have any timed raffles during this event um but we have so much stuff that you can still enter in to win I mean all the raffles will be done at the end of
[13:53.37]Dota Fortress, I think that's when they're going to start compiling results and somehow trying to dish all these items out to people.
[13:59.00]I mean, Lang was sort of racking his brain like, this is going to be really hard.
[14:03.92]We had this awesome quilt that was knitted.
[14:06.01]Who was it knitted by?
[14:07.41]Enraizmum.
[14:08.65]Yeah.
[14:08.91]And this thing, I mean, how do you put a price tag on this?
[14:11.70]It's one of a kind.
[14:12.70]It's literally a one-of-one item.
[14:14.82]The other side we had up yesterday, which is all the TF2 logo, and it's like that orange TF2 color.
[14:19.93]I don't know if you wouldn't use it.
[14:21.77]It's so soft, though.
[14:22.47]I mean, how could you not?
[14:23.05]All the stitching there comes through the other side as well.
[14:24.66]I don't know.
[14:25.04]It's really cool.
[14:25.92]It's cool.
[14:27.16]Yeah.
[14:28.16]I think we're ready to go.
[14:29.02]People are filing into the servers here.
[14:30.50]That shirt, by the way, adds.
[14:32.63]I wonder if we can get a second print of those shirts, the platinum shirts.
[14:35.55]Those are so good.
[14:36.49]I want one of those so badly.
[14:37.56]We'll have to talk to Carl Yangsheng.
[14:39.30]Oh, man.
[14:39.50]Damn it.
[14:40.08]CEO of Classic Mixup.
[14:41.80]The best.
[14:42.20]We did get another $100 donation from Carl Yangsheng, who is Enigma, the proprietor of Team Fortress.TV.
[14:48.75]That was while we were on break.
[14:50.39]We are still getting all of your donations in with the comments as well.
[14:54.60]We'll try to find time to read them.
[14:55.94]But of course, once the action starts, we go into the game screen.
[14:58.99]We're going to get right to it here.
[15:01.53]We'll try to get to as many as we can.
[15:03.57]We do have a $166 donation from Brad Pitt.
[15:08.48]I saw that name at some point.
[15:10.36]Community Head, I think?
[15:13.21]Is it backpack.tf?
[15:16.51]Backpack.tf.
[15:17.41]He was controlling the prices of all the items in Team Fortress.
[15:21.76]He's like laughing at the unboxing.
[15:24.42]I actually don't see the comments right now on my thing.
[15:28.21]So I don't know if Brad left a comment.
[15:30.41]I'm sorry, Brad.
[15:31.21]I'll try to refresh this and get the comments up, because obviously all your donations, the comments, we should read them and try to get to as many as possible.
[15:38.67]$166, that's really great.
[15:41.15]So thank you very much.
[15:42.25]And keep them coming as we are approaching 200K.
[15:45.84]By the way, that's double what we did last year.
[15:47.60]It is, yeah.
[15:48.54]Last year we did 108, and this year... Well, if we actually did get doubled up, we got to 216...
[15:53.35]We still have to count all the auction items.
[15:55.47]Those are still available on the Steam forums.
[15:59.66]If you look in the chat, the chat will give you a link to how to do that, and it's one-of-one hats, signed in-game items from Star and Jerma.
[16:07.68]Those are really high right now on the bid war because people absolutely adore those, too.
[16:11.97]I love them, too.
[16:12.95]I don't know if I'd spend $800 on a signed... I mean, how could you not?
[16:16.81]I always forget how to do that.
[16:20.69]Hey, Star and Jerma, will you guys be joining us on this cast?
[16:22.78]Yeah, do you know?
[16:24.72]I think I heard their voice maybe, but I'm not quite sure.
[16:27.16]Maybe they can't hear us.
[16:28.13]Are we loading into the game right now?
[16:29.23]I do look over at Mila's screen.
[16:30.59]He looks like he's playing video games.
[16:31.83]Yeah, red team is ready.
[16:33.47]Looks like they're both ready.
[16:34.39]So I think we're going to go into the game now, and we're going to play some TF2 like we've never really seen it before, and I'm excited.
[16:40.66]Hey, just to clarify, right now there's some audio issues.
[16:43.44]We can't hear you guys talking, so I didn't even mean to say it.
[16:46.46]Sorry.
[16:47.35]We cannot hear you guys through Bumble.
[16:51.03]Oh, so we just talked for a lot without it meaning anything.
[16:54.78]That's cool.
[16:55.48]Okay.
[16:56.30]I think the stream still heard us, I hope.
[16:57.95]Oh, the stream can still hear us?
[16:59.15]We can hear you guys.
[17:00.26]Maybe Mumble can't hear us?
[17:01.88]We're monkeys sitting on a couch in a chair.
[17:05.85]We don't know what's going on.
[17:07.01]I got a tablet over here.
[17:08.33]That's all I got.
[17:09.01]I didn't see it last year.
[17:11.52]It looks like we're getting into the game here now.
[17:12.92]So Team Gemma versus Team Star.
[17:14.48]Alright, let's go.
[17:15.04]I'm ready.
[17:15.92]So it's going to be interesting right off the bat to see the rollout.
[17:18.43]I'm not sure if we're going to be able to see both, to see how many of these demo men are able to make it to mid with health.
[17:24.66]But, yeah, looks like we do have...
[17:28.21]Samaka is just going to go slow, putting as many heals as he can.
[17:31.33]I think I hear the Quick-Fix being run by Pure, and yeah, that is actually a thing.
[17:35.77]So he's going to be able to fly with his Uber team, but he's already dead.
[17:39.48]We're going to switch over to the Stabby Stabby Cam, and he's going to get shut down as well.
[17:43.00]I think he already got his Dead Ringer rung, and it doesn't look good right now for the Star team.
[17:47.40]In fact, only two up.
[17:49.62]Oh!
[17:49.97]Oh, my goodness.
[17:50.81]Mayla.
[17:51.19]Mayla welcomes Tyrone back to TF2.
[17:54.29]The Eye by Power rep, he's going to be respawning.
[17:57.17]That was a big shot.
[17:58.19]I hear the players getting hyped.
[18:01.38]Yeah, I was getting stoked.
[18:03.56]Mela running the direct hit because it's for the kids.
[18:06.52]Wow.
[18:07.66]And we have the Tomislav heavy.
[18:09.32]That's going to be so hard to deal with coming into last right now.
[18:12.35]The fragile is going to be able to pop.
[18:14.25]Brad still running the Quick-Fix, but even that quick building weapon, not going to get done in time.
[18:19.57]Here comes the Mela uber.
[18:20.59]He's missing those direct hit shots, much harder to connect with.
[18:23.26]He's going to bump in and kill Tyrone again.
[18:25.22]Of course, pocketing because he can't do anything else.
[18:27.38]Oh!
[18:27.42]Oh, shoot.
[18:28.62]Taggerung gets this bell rung.
[18:31.59]Wow.
[18:32.23]Jeez.
[18:32.77]And that's round one.
[18:34.95]Hold on.
[18:35.13]Let me go get this $100 out of my wallet.
[18:37.33]Oh, my goodness.
[18:38.11]Oh, my goodness.
[18:39.18]Alright.
[18:39.90]Mirable.
[18:41.06]These guys are already running away with it.
[18:43.54]Let's go keep Jerma.
[18:44.28]This double Demoman rollout is great, by the way.
[18:45.99]Katus is rocking the Sticky Jumper here.
[18:47.61]Sticky Jumper for Katus.
[18:48.29]Shenanigans incoming.
[18:49.35]Still gets to mid with no life.
[18:50.37]Bombs up with a Loose Cannon.
[18:51.35]Pre-fire in the house, but nobody's there.
[18:53.68]He hasn't got the timing down yet on this opposition roster.
[18:59.03]But now we've got the tag cam here, he's getting his buffs, he's getting ready to jump as he's bringing Pure with him with that Quick Breaks tags into the enemy valley here, but manages to kill himself off, or Mila killed him.
[19:08.80]Direct hit again.
[19:10.57]Already Mila has Tag's number, a nemesis in the making here.
[19:14.43]Oh, yeah, Melee is on fire.
[19:15.57]He's doing so well this game.
[19:16.68]But there's just so many Domemen on the field.
[19:18.34]Like, there's so many projectiles just flying all over the place.
[19:20.14]It's crazy.
[19:20.58]Yeah, but you can't heal.
[19:21.36]And with that Thomas Lobb at the back of the car just dumping damage consistently, there's so much for Pure to do.
[19:26.71]And I believe he already popped his Quick-Fix, and we didn't even see it, so it didn't do much.
[19:30.97]Fragile has his regular Uber.
[19:32.93]Shrugger is going to beat Smaka to death.
[19:35.48]I don't even know if Smaka plays TF2 anymore.
[19:37.52]But Shrugger definitely does, and he just hit a home run there, or at least a ground rule double.
[19:42.19]And Red is going to be able to cap the point.
[19:43.61]And Fragile has Uber, and he's so safe, because he just has a sandwich-eating, Tomislav-wielding Heavy, who's just going to kill everything.
[19:50.68]Yeah, this turtle strategy is working out pretty well for Team Germany.
[19:53.11]What are you going to do?
[19:57.08]Oh!
[19:57.20]Calm down, calm down.
[19:58.02]Good one, honey.
[20:00.18]Well, Mila still had control of that Spire, though.
[20:02.56]He's doing a pretty good job.
[20:04.49]I'm not sure if Tigers even got a single frag yet, but Mila is dunking on him right now.
[20:09.35]Yeah, this is where the two demos are going to play a bigger role.
[20:11.78]A lot of spam angles and lanes to throw those stickies.
[20:15.54]And here's the Quick-Fix.
[20:16.24]It does get popped, and Pure is like, here, have some health, and now we're going to die.
[20:20.57]There's a wrangled sentry gun over there.
[20:22.49]Let's have fun.
[20:23.13]We're playing TF2, boys.
[20:24.95]And there come the two demos, trying their best to do anything, but they don't even have an uber, Smaca is dead yet again, and Pretzels is creeping his way into the base of Mirable with that minigun.
[20:37.29]pouring out damage.
[20:38.23]Yeah, this Thomas Lab is so powerful now.
[20:40.11]So good.
[20:40.59]Buffed in the gunmetal update, but a lot of heavy mains just using it outright now.
[20:45.90]Here we see this stabby cannon.
[20:47.49]It's looking under gray bridge here.
[20:49.35]Golden Knight.
[20:49.81]The audio issues have been solved.
[20:51.35]We are now here.
[20:52.29]Hello.
[20:52.77]Hey!
[20:53.47]Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[20:54.80]We had audio issues, but it looks like Star and Jerma have rejoined us.
[20:57.40]And Jerma, you're up on the board.
[20:58.70]1-0.
[20:59.18]I'm pretty disappointed.
[21:00.21]You know,
[21:00.43]Everyone's going to be like, Ster, you picked the wrong thing.
[21:02.95]Oh, you did it wrong.
[21:04.17]Tag has the rocket jumper.
[21:06.37]What's going on?
[21:07.09]I was going to ask.
[21:09.08]If this is Dota, you should be able to buy your team.
[21:11.24]You should be able to pick what unlocks they use.
[21:13.52]Maybe Pure should use the uber gun instead of the Quick-Fix.
[21:16.15]I know.
[21:16.69]You're a soldier.
[21:17.73]Use some freaking physical power items, you moron.
[21:21.81]Chewing them out right now.
[21:23.29]Yeah, and Kydus actually is running these sticky jumpers.
[21:25.35]So two of your big classes deciding not to do damage.
[21:28.52]So they don't care.
[21:29.54]And it's going to cost me $100.
[21:32.21]Another round on the board.
[21:33.59]There's still two matches.
[21:34.73]There's two matches.
[21:35.65]I'm liking the Mini-Sentry by Jordan here.
[21:37.90]What changes do you think you're going to make if this stays the way it does?
[21:41.29]Heading into the next one.
[21:42.43]Uh, gonna pick Clockwork.
[21:45.41]Pick people who don't pick it seriously.
[21:47.58]Clockwork will troll the most.
[21:49.56]And we're gonna go to mid here.
[21:50.35]Can Blue do anything?
[21:51.23]Can Star's team pick up the pieces?
[21:52.59]Duatna's going absolutely crazy, but doesn't do anything, actually, and gets blasted by Stabby with the... I don't even know what gun that is.
[21:59.33]Is that the Ambassador?
[22:00.45]Yeah, he's got a golden one.
[22:02.13]Yeah, the gold gun right there.
[22:03.22]One shot, one kill.
[22:04.40]Shrugger is just absolutely dominating everybody in this game.
[22:07.16]Smack is being dominated, and he's just going to run buck wild, killing everybody.
[22:13.22]I made up words over there.
[22:14.32]Don't worry about it.
[22:16.04]Star's team is going to make a brief appearance in mid and then leave.
[22:18.77]There is a Quick-Fix being popped.
[22:20.17]I'm sure Star is really happy about Pure running that weapon.
[22:22.75]But he can't die right now.
[22:23.77]This flank from Mela.
[22:24.78]Big pick there onto the Medic.
[22:26.04]And it looks like Team Jerma completely wiped Team Star.
[22:29.38]This is not looking good for Team Star at all.
[22:30.97]Destroyed right there.
[22:33.11]Star, how much did you say you'd pay if Jerma beat you?
[22:35.63]400.
[22:36.77]Let's make it 500.
[22:37.32]Oh, wow.
[22:39.00]Ooh.
[22:39.64]He's going to make a two-map comeback.
[22:42.12]Because I already did.
[22:43.46]Oh, my God.
[22:46.43]Oh, Shrugger just showing off there with the... What's that?
[22:51.35]I don't know.
[22:52.44]It's a cleaver, buddy.
[22:53.42]Some of those stun guillotines, those are looking pretty sweet.
[22:57.30]yeah he's absolutely a monster stab he's coming in trying to get us that does get mayla and his dead ringing out doesn't even have to and there's actually a uh red presence on spire blue have to just fall back trying to build uber with a spy pretty strong tactic I think I like that a lot I think your top sixes team will see that shrugger is going to beat
[23:15.70]Oh, my goodness.
[23:17.98]The Sandman puts him to sleep.
[23:20.16]Finally could miss a few shots.
[23:21.46]That's fine.
[23:22.28]Here comes the Uber 4 Red, the fragile and company marching in towards last.
[23:26.73]There's a back half attempt here, but a heavy has a shotgun as well.
[23:30.07]They can give him the best class in the game.
[23:31.68]It's hard to defend last without a medic, you know?
[23:33.60]And that sick pick there by Shrugger is looking like it's going to –
[23:37.14]close out this round.
[23:37.94]There's only one player alive for Team Star.
[23:39.83]It's going to be Smaka.
[23:41.15]He's hiding around that top right side.
[23:42.93]Storing sticks onto the point.
[23:43.89]Another pick there from Duatna.
[23:45.08]Kits the medic down pure.
[23:46.92]And now it's the Duatna-Smaka 1v1.
[23:48.90]Oh, soldiers coming in to try and help out.
[23:50.29]Duatna does get that pick, and they're trying to close out.
[23:52.59]Fragile just throwing syringe needles at the point, trying to get this cap down, and it looks like they're going to make it 3-0.
[24:00.58]How the hell did he make that work?
[24:02.09]The big spawn wave came and there's like four guys, but somehow... None of them do any damage.
[24:07.61]They've all got gimmick weapons, jumping weapons.
[24:10.32]So, Star, how do you feel about Tag at two points right now?
[24:15.03]Was that a good... They're not in the channel.
[24:17.91]They moved them out on us.
[24:19.73]That's too bad.
[24:20.20]I feel sad about it.
[24:20.64]I don't feel very good about it.
[24:21.88]I feel great about it.
[24:22.56]Tag, got to step it up over there, buddy.
[24:24.82]Slin is calling Tag out across.
[24:26.36]He can't hear him because these headphones are so robust with the sound cancellation.
[24:31.75]Actually, we are done.
[24:33.13]That was it.
[24:33.48]We're playing to three, apparently.
[24:34.88]Mercy rule?
[24:36.53]We're playing to five.
[24:37.57]Config bug.
[24:38.99]I think we're going to swap out different players into the couch each time.
[24:41.80]So why don't I tap out and get your old casting buddy in here.
[24:47.36]He's sitting here.
[24:48.14]He's eating check mix.
[24:50.36]I'm going in.
[24:51.02]I'm not exactly sure, guys, what's going on with the server.
[24:55.19]That's going to be the first round there.
[24:56.89]No, it's not over.
[24:57.85]It was only 3-0.
[25:00.06]Maybe Star left our channel to go talk to his team.
[25:05.81]Ask, plead with them.
[25:07.05]Tag, please.
[25:07.61]We're on a rocket launcher that does damage.
[25:09.43]Yeah, they're going to the team huddle right now and trying to convince the Tigers.
[25:12.94]I'm sorry, we're back.
[25:13.98]We have some more stuff going on, you know, important stuff.
[25:16.84]We're trying to buy groceries online, and, like, it's a bad time.
[25:22.63]I don't know what my boys are doing.
[25:24.44]Can you get into their channel, maybe give them a little pep talk?
[25:28.96]I wish, but I don't want to talk to them.
[25:31.69]You're scared of, like, what Smack will say?
[25:33.83]No, I'm scared of, like, losing.
[25:37.77]I don't want to degrade them.
[25:38.96]I don't want to make them feel bad.
[25:40.85]Hey, it's alright.
[25:42.15]There's two more games.
[25:44.62]Is the Fragile lagged out, or is he just that confident?
[25:49.34]Probably that confident.
[25:50.66]So we are trying to figure out what's going on with the server.
[25:53.55]I haven't gotten word.
[25:54.79]They say that they are going to fix it.
[25:56.29]I think they're going to play the rest of this first to five like you would a normal.
[26:00.12]Lang is fixing it, so once you hear a computer fix booming throughout the LAN center, I think we'll be okay.
[26:06.24]Lang has like three community weapons.
[26:07.89]He's just so good at fixing stuff.
[26:09.93]So he's got what?
[26:11.31]He's got one for MG.
[26:12.71]I think he has three rocket launchers too.
[26:14.15]I think he didn't even pick three different community weapons.
[26:15.91]No, he has two.
[26:16.58]He has two community weapons.
[26:18.16]Two community weapons?
[26:18.82]How many do you have?
[26:20.32]One.
[26:21.48]Sad face.
[26:23.12]Mario, how many do you have?
[26:24.46]I got a nice community uber, so it serves me well.
[26:28.05]Bear, what do you have?
[26:28.87]Oh, I don't have anything.
[26:30.11]What?
[26:30.37]I don't even have a backpack.
[26:31.07]They took it.
[26:31.97]They took your backpack?
[26:32.85]Yeah, they gave it to Star.
[26:34.21]He didn't want it, so.
[26:35.71]Hey, I just got to say, I mean, the server's messed up.
[26:39.20]Hey.
[26:40.56]You know, none of this was my team's fault.
[26:42.76]Right, right.
[26:43.42]Are we going to restart?
[26:44.39]The odds were against them.
[26:45.79]0-0?
[26:46.59]Just to give this a... Just to give it another go so we can see them get through it.
[26:49.72]Let's smack a warm-up on these plates here, too, in a couple years.
[26:53.63]Is this a coincidence?
[26:54.23]Like, Star's team goes 3-0 down and the server mysteriously has an issue?
[26:58.50]Yeah.
[26:58.58]Looks like we're back in it, so I think we're just going to start it at 15 minutes, 3-0.
[27:03.05]So we'll call that like an old halftime.
[27:05.17]Didn't you used to go to halftime at 3?
[27:06.93]Used to be at 3.
[27:08.11]That's old halftime.
[27:09.29]Now we do 4-0.
[27:10.29]Intermission in the old days.
[27:12.58]In the old days.
[27:13.40]I think Baby, to an extent, Tag is trying to be a fat scout and just is trying to counter the Strugger who is so good at dodging the rockets.
[27:21.06]Maybe he's just big boat and stuff.
[27:22.07]Doesn't have confidence.
[27:23.91]Gotta have confidence, dude.
[27:25.99]GOT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE.
[27:26.77]MAYLA JUMPING IN.
[27:27.49]WE'RE KEEPING IT ON THE MAYLA CAM BECAUSE HE'S HIT SOME INSANE DIRECT HIT SHOTS.
[27:30.69]PRETZEL'S GOING TO WALK ON TO THE POINT.
[27:32.41]THAT Thomas WILL HAVE 300 BIG HEALTH POINTS.
[27:35.62]AND LOOK HOW LOW THAT BLUE TEAM IS.
[27:37.02]TYRONE AND COMPANY NEED TO GET OUT.
[27:38.62]PURE ACTUALLY HAS A Medi Gun NOW.
[27:40.50]WE DO HAVE A SPY.
[27:41.54]SPY IS BEHIND, BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.
[27:43.42]THEY'RE FINDING HIM, AND THEY'RE KILLING HIM.
[27:45.40]OF COURSE, ENGINEER'S VERY GOOD.
[27:47.95]HIGHLANDER ENGINEER'S VERY GOOD AT FINDING SPIES.
[27:50.33]PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DO MOST OF THE GAME.
[27:52.17]AND NOW RED IS LOOKING TO END THIS PRETTY QUICKLY, MR. ADMIRABLE.
[27:55.96]Tag has decided to switch up to a weapon that actually does damage.
[27:59.46]It also gives him health as well.
[28:00.81]This black box is keeping him on life support here, but he has shown himself in the house.
[28:05.20]They're slightly distracted here, but he's just running away.
[28:09.63]He's running around picking up mud packs here.
[28:11.94]SPYRE HASN'T GONE DOWN YET.
[28:13.28]TAG'S TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ON THE BACK.
[28:15.58]HE'S GOT THAT.
[28:16.28]IT'S A GOOD BACK-HAPPENING WEAPON.
[28:17.16]HE CAN KEEP REGENING HEALTH, AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD TACTIC FOR TAG, BECAUSE THEY'RE SLOW.
[28:22.09]THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF JUMPING CLASSES, SO THAT HEAVY HAS TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET BACK, BUT HE'S GOING TO GET ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED BY SHRUGGER.
[28:27.57]BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE IS A DOUBLE KILL OUT ON SPYRE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE TEAM STAR IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEMSELVES UP.
[28:32.76]THERE'S AN UBER COMING IN TOWARDS THEM RIGHT NOW, AND LOOKING AT BRAD, HE'S ONLY AT 50% UBER
[28:41.91]Getting healed, dude.
[28:43.81]Wow, I didn't even see that.
[28:45.09]Some missteps, man.
[28:46.48]Stabby was getting healed.
[28:47.82]Starting up, he's three health with the Dead Ringer right now, but did get a big kill on the heavy.
[28:52.37]Needs to do that a lot more if Team Star has a chance in this game.
[28:55.90]Yeah, that's what we hoped for, that he'd be that hard counter to the heavy smart pick there.
[29:00.50]Jordan set up his Mini-Sentry on middle.
[29:02.67]We're going to see a little bit.
[29:03.53]It's the wrangled Mini-Sentry just to make Star as mad as possible.
[29:07.13]Dewatna running that.
[29:09.16]The newest Demoman unlocked.
[29:10.72]He's got his quickie bomb launcher and the iron bomber.
[29:16.25]Smack is running it too, actually.
[29:17.53]So, I don't know.
[29:19.91]That guy must be pretty good.
[29:21.07]Quickie Bomb is actually kind of bonkers.
[29:26.60]Especially if you're going to have a team for some reason with two Demoman, you can afford to have it.
[29:31.41]Here comes the Uber, and Fragile doesn't have it yet.
[29:34.37]The Heavy is held up to dry.
[29:35.77]He's going to die.
[29:36.73]Fragile does get away.
[29:37.69]He's at 55 health somewhere.
[29:38.81]I'm not sure if they're going to close down on him.
[29:40.06]So many jumping people here.
[29:41.90]Kydus jumps around the world trying to find the Medic.
[29:44.80]But Fragile somewhere is smiling like a kitty cat.
[29:47.18]He's just fine.
[29:50.15]They're gonna take this fire.
[30:08.00]Fragile still has Uber.
[30:09.40]He's going to let his entire team die, though.
[30:11.05]It does finally pop on Mela, who has the Spire weapon, the direct hit, and he's going to see Stabby shoot Stabby, but, of course, dead ringering, increasingly making people mad with that weapon.
[30:20.38]Stabby is probably the best dead ringerer in the world, and just so frustrating with it.
[30:25.58]Shrugger's going to beat him to death with a baseball bat, though.
[30:28.14]Oh, my goodness.
[30:28.77]And that's the hard counter to the Dead Ringer.
[30:31.37]You just get beaten to death with a baseball bat.
[30:33.40]Yeah, Shrugger just running around causing little bits of chaos where he can.
[30:37.60]He's got more kills with the bat than Smaggot has with all weapons.
[30:41.30]Oh!
[30:43.56]Tyrone!
[30:44.84]Not the best tactic against the direct hit to do a slow lollipop jump.
[30:51.25]It's a Euro TF2 circa 2009 right there, so good.
[30:55.02]The tag is going to go down as well, and the Team Star lose two soldiers, and now they're going to have to go back onto probably their second point, as Fragile does have Uber right now.
[31:05.07]So probably we haven't seen more crits or silliness.
[31:07.54]Stabby tries to make a play, but he goes to his Dead Ringer, so he's not dead.
[31:10.76]He's going to run around, but they know he's still there.
[31:12.94]Mela misses a pretty easy one, but that's fine because there's a sentry gun to shoot Kytus and make him very, very mad.
[31:20.14]Yeah, I think he juggled him up for the sentry.
[31:23.14]He's tagged, though.
[31:24.24]Ooh, roamer strats right here.
[31:25.56]Oh, a real gun.
[31:27.17]Oh, ooh.
[31:28.47]Ooh, getting almost 100 damage with that demo.
[31:31.09]Yeah, maybe about 60.
[31:34.67]Back cap right now, but I don't think anyone's going to be able to stop Spire, and that's going to obviously cap faster.
[31:41.76]Good attempt, though, by Team Star.
[31:43.22]Now they're going to get pushed on to last.
[31:44.41]Fragile still has that same uber.
[31:45.77]It will finally pop.
[31:47.17]Heavy's going to sprint in with the Thomas Love behind and just set up and artillery gun down whatever blue person is stupid enough to try to stop this.
[31:55.04]And I don't think that there will be enough to try, and that is going to be the fourth round.
[31:59.40]I think good attempt might be a little bit too generous for Team Star.
[32:01.75]They're getting rolled pretty badly here.
[32:03.43]That was a more competitive round.
[32:04.59]This team Jerma is looking pretty strong.
[32:06.82]It's pretty strong.
[32:07.88]I think it's really well thought out as well.
[32:11.30]The NG heavy is a good combination.
[32:13.43]The NG is able to really stop any bombing from coming in with those little Mini-Sentry popping everybody up.
[32:19.26]But who knows?
[32:19.80]We could have the comeback of dreams.
[32:21.08]We have 9 minutes and 40 seconds.
[32:22.86]It's going to be kind of like a nightmare.
[32:24.69]Kytus is having the time of his life jumping around.
[32:27.33]Still with 52 health even with a gun that does no damage to him.
[32:30.41]We were talking about this before, Star.
[32:37.33]Maybe you were saying picking the item they had to use would be...
[32:41.58]Yeah, we thought maybe that would be interesting.
[32:43.50]I didn't expect to see this much of weapon variety.
[32:47.71]I even like seeing Mini-Sentries.
[32:50.29]I'm like, oh yeah, I guess they can do that.
[32:54.27]They can do Mini-Sentries.
[32:55.65]It's a thing they have.
[32:56.36]Yeah, they're going to have such a slow energy to come around.
[32:58.78]I can afford two demos.
[33:00.16]But he is out and about in the world with an item.
[33:04.68]Yeah, your arch nemesis item.
[33:08.17]Just forget it exists.
[33:09.89]He's doing work, too.
[33:11.75]OH, THIS COULD BE IT RIGHT HERE, THE FINAL PUSH-IN.
[33:14.52]WE ARE PLAYING FIRST TO FIVE.
[33:16.20]TEAM Jerma LOOKING INCREDIBLY STRONG.
[33:18.18]THERE ARE A COUPLE KILLS THERE.
[33:19.06]KAI JUST DOES HIT A PIPE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE BLUE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS, BUT STILL A LOT OF RED PRESENTS ON THE POINT.
[33:24.95]STRUGGER STILL HAS A BASEBALL BAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
[33:27.33]PEAR FELT THE POINT OF THOSE SWINGS, AND THERE'S A GG.
[33:31.20]TEAM STAR PUT UP A, LIKE I'D SAY,
[33:35.13]Oh, they're going to keep going, I'm told, from production, making the decision that they're going to drag on the embarrassment for Team Star.
[33:44.34]I mean, they did better than they were doing before.
[33:47.31]Give them some slack here.
[33:48.51]So we're going to play the last eight minutes of this match here, and it looks like Team Jerma up 5-0.
[33:55.12]Maybe they can keep it going, or can Team Star get around on the board?
[33:58.39]I don't know.
[33:58.67]Maybe Star can take this time to reevaluate what his plans for the next 6v6 run-through is going to be, where his plan may have gone wrong and what he can do in the future here.
[34:07.44]Of course, these players will be ineligible.
[34:09.72]The banned players will be back and able to be picked.
[34:12.57]Banny, not picked or banned, could still play a game of TF2 tonight.
[34:17.14]depending if anyone wants them.
[34:18.07]I don't know why you would.
[34:19.17]There's a lot of good players left open.
[34:21.21]Maybe I just wanted to get some losers out there first.
[34:23.62]Tag's gone.
[34:27.92]He's over there smiling away.
[34:30.63]He's on your team right now.
[34:33.65]Tag has never been on my team in anything.
[34:36.84]I'll deny it.
[34:38.91]SEE, RIGHT NOW IF YOU WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, TAG.
[34:41.20]OH, BIG STAB.
[34:43.34]YEAH.
[34:43.46]MAYBE YOU'D GIVE HIM THE WIND UNDER HIS WINGS, SO TO SPEAK, TO PUSH FORWARD AND COME BACK AND DO IT SIX WINS IN A ROW.
[34:52.46]I mean, they could.
[34:54.19]Absolutely could.
[34:55.51]It'd be tough, though.
[34:56.15]We're guessing no.
[34:56.89]They are using rocket launchers now.
[34:58.43]Quick-Fix is out for Brad.
[35:00.10]Pure decides that that's a good idea.
[35:02.14]I'm not sure about that one, but we'll see.
[35:04.60]He would be able, in theory... Hey!
[35:06.57]Stabby, stabby.
[35:07.65]Gets the backstab on the heavy for the second time.
[35:09.97]And I actually think there's a pretty good chance that Spire's going to go down here.
[35:13.16]Tyrone's rolling in.
[35:14.84]He gets a frag onto Maela.
[35:16.64]And that's good stuff.
[35:18.54]Got this Quick-Fix.
[35:20.08]There he goes, Quick-Fix.
[35:20.80]Brad's popping it in.
[35:22.16]Bradgill's at 90%, but oh, he will sneak in there.
[35:25.33]Nimble like a kitty cat into second spawn.
[35:28.70]Now he has Uber in second spawn, and it looks like Shrugger has a baseball bat.
[35:33.95]Aw.
[35:33.99]Yeah, Tyrone brushing off that rust.
[35:35.62]He's finally getting some frags and getting back in there.
[35:38.26]Tyrone.
[35:39.14]He just gets picked up by Jordan right now.
[35:41.44]And Shrugger's on fire too, getting up to 2k.
[35:44.53]Yeah, I think you'd have to put Shrugger as the MVP of Team Jerma so far.
[35:49.14]Really carrying.
[35:49.68]Tag the LDP.
[35:51.04]But Mantle's been hitting some crazy shots too, though.
[35:53.16]I mean, it's been good across the board.
[35:54.58]They've all been good.
[35:55.46]Yeah.
[35:56.13]We hit Tab really fast.
[35:57.09]I think Shrugger has like 150 points.
[36:00.67]It's just real fun to watch people be very good at this video game.
[36:12.25]Who do you think the MVP of your team is, Jeremiah?
[36:15.47]If you had to give the award out.
[36:17.56]If I had to give the award out?
[36:19.36]You split it six ways.
[36:21.65]I don't know.
[36:22.01]I'm going to have to see Jordan.
[36:23.09]I am.
[36:23.77]I think he's been doing a whole lot of denial.
[36:25.66]You see the mini centuries.
[36:26.74]It's been incredibly difficult to deal with.
[36:29.56]He's been landing plenty of shotgun hits.
[36:31.51]I'm going to go with Jordan as my current MVP.
[36:33.73]I think without him, without that area denial, it might have been maybe a different story.
[36:38.90]I think he's really the thorn in Stabby's side.
[36:41.66]Yeah, that too.
[36:42.30]Which I think could be with the reverses, like the Spy would be the thorn in the Engie's side, but it's... Yeah, but Stabby's really going, trying to make the plays, and, you know, maybe he's not so worried about the Engineer.
[36:50.06]It's like, ah, he's just an Engie.
[36:50.92]This guy from the South is shocking.
[36:52.24]What's he going to do?
[36:53.28]It's again, I forgot the Minis.
[36:54.49]Like, you're going to go sap a Mini?
[36:55.69]Who cares?
[36:56.49]Right, yeah.
[36:56.85]No one cares.
[36:58.23]True, and then he, you know, no dispensers, no teleporters.
[37:00.96]Who cares about that either?
[37:02.48]Oh.
[37:02.52]Here comes Team Red, the death ball, the heavy coming in.
[37:05.64]Fragile doesn't have Uber.
[37:06.78]Tyrone's going to hit 100 rockets on a spun-up heavy, feel pretty good about it.
[37:10.11]And now he's one-on-one with the medic.
[37:11.79]You know, he's got his medic with him.
[37:13.05]He's going to jump up to try to stop that spire cap.
[37:16.25]Maybe he could have jumped that medic, but whatever.
[37:17.73]Now he's squaring off with Mela, who has the direct hit and is just pelting him with direct hit shots.
[37:24.08]And the demo as well, shooting a bunch of damage up there to him.
[37:26.50]But Red is on the ground, low on life.
[37:29.44]Fragile does have Uber.
[37:31.38]Fragile has Uber.
[37:33.72]He doesn't have a pocket, but that's okay.
[37:35.84]He has Duatna.
[37:37.89]I'm loving these quick-fix shenanigans, too, from Pure, because he's able to just fly around the screen, like up on top of Spire, defending that.
[37:44.60]Now he's over here against this Uber that's coming in from Shrugger.
[37:47.46]Shrugger missing quite a few shots, though.
[37:49.74]He should have pulled the bat up.
[37:53.05]We'll go down to Tyrone.
[37:54.51]And Attaro maybe getting a little bit of that rust off, playing back to his old form.
[37:59.34]Does kill the medic with that Quick-Fix.
[38:01.48]Probably doesn't know what that item does, but that's okay.
[38:05.21]Schmacka using the Iron Bomber right now.
[38:07.91]That's awesome.
[38:08.97]What is the Iron Bomber for us that don't know?
[38:11.07]It doesn't roll when it hits the ground.
[38:13.64]It does very slightly less damage.
[38:15.70]I think you also take less damage if you jump off of it, so it's meant to sit in the spot so you can jump.
[38:21.02]You've seen it before.
[38:21.64]It's cool to see a bunch of different items.
[38:24.87]Yeah.
[38:26.47]Definitely.
[38:27.75]Because isn't it usually, like, you wouldn't see somebody use an Iron Bomber in a... I don't think anyone is using stock weapons besides, like, I think Shrugger is using the Scattergun.
[38:38.19]I think the Fragile is using a stock Metagun here.
[38:40.63]Yeah.
[38:41.09]Yeah.
[38:43.65]It's a... I want Team Star to get on the board, but they're having a tough time here.
[38:48.66]Stabby's running around trying to make plays.
[38:50.48]He is, and, you know, the spy's at his best, most effective when there's a lot of carnage going around, and, you know, he needs his team to come in and distract so he's able to do stuff, but, you know, they're just dying really fast.
[39:00.30]Shruggers whipping those butcher cleavers around, and Jordan's got 4K spree because he murders Stabby, and all that's left is a tag.
[39:08.71]Yeah, Jerma picked quite the crew for this first match here.
[39:12.74]I don't know what the rest of his playbook says, but he did a good job.
[39:15.60]He did a great job.
[39:16.38]Maybe took a little flak last year for picking Stabby first, and Team Star was pretty dominant in that series, at least the first game.
[39:23.09]In fact, I think Robin Walker was blatantly cheating in the second game, and I believe he still lost that game.
[39:29.38]Yeah, he still lost that game.
[39:30.52]But that's okay.
[39:31.54]Robin Walker was flying around the map, shooting crit rockets at every corner.
[39:36.59]The realness?
[39:37.65]If Paolo was cheating, that's why they won.
[39:40.36]We had a cheater on each side.
[39:43.49]Secrets revealed.
[39:46.33]Duana pushes in with the Uber.
[39:47.81]Brad gets avoided.
[39:49.09]Was Robin Walker even on?
[39:50.05]I don't even remember.
[39:50.93]It's so muddled.
[39:51.65]I was so embarrassed.
[39:53.06]What was he what?
[39:56.34]He had that minigun crit rocket throwing thing.
[40:00.67]And it's 6-0.
[40:02.11]Yeah.
[40:02.83]The chat is chanting, come back, come back.
[40:05.66]But it's 6-0 right now.
[40:08.44]Unless Robin Walker comes in.
[40:10.83]I'm not sure if we reached out to him this year.
[40:16.73]I think that was one of the highlights, certainly one of the big highlights last year, was him coming in and showing us his little bag of hack tricks.
[40:23.68]I don't know.
[40:24.16]We wouldn't mind seeing that again, but he's probably out doing some super secret Valve stuff.
[40:31.17]What are we playing until?
[40:38.23]Until the time limit is up.
[40:39.60]So one minute and whatever.
[40:41.18]So you guys can start thinking about what your next team is going to look like.
[40:44.69]Jerma, pick another unbelievably good team.
[40:46.82]If I get banned again, I'll be pissed.
[40:48.14]I'm just saying that.
[40:49.01]That's right, Slim.
[40:49.51]You could actually play.
[40:50.97]Yeah, I can play the next one.
[40:52.78]Bloodsire AA is in the pool.
[40:54.66]Got banned against all odds.
[40:56.72]Let me tell you who's going to get banned next time.
[40:59.41]No, you don't.
[41:00.49]Mr. Sher Lin.
[41:03.15]I've been working very closely with my playbook.
[41:04.97]Me and John Madden have been working closely.
[41:07.12]I'm learning from the greats.
[41:08.80]Bill Belichick gave me his playbook.
[41:10.24]We talked about it.
[41:11.86]Oh, Billy B.?
[41:13.16]Yeah, he was like, you know, Jeremy, let me tell you something.
[41:16.55]You should be picking first Maywa.
[41:19.86]And I was like, thank you, Bill.
[41:21.12]And go Patriots.
[41:23.14]Hooray.
[41:24.52]Tom Brady is an innocent man.
[41:26.17]And I will say to the day that I die to Tom Brady, those balls already would have flayed it.
[41:34.88]Something along those lines.
[41:38.00]Thank you for distracting everyone from another humiliating defeat in those two minutes that we had.
[41:43.41]There's maybe 10 seconds left just for it to sink in a little bit more.
[41:46.94]I think I'm going to have to hit my own playbook a little harder with other famous names from sports I don't know.
[41:53.55]You have to do a pretty good impression to top that.
[41:55.25]I've never seen someone destroyed so badly in an exhibition match.
[41:59.29]I mean, we've seen some NA versus you.
[42:02.02]Test storms.
[42:03.08]Alright, so that was your first game.
[42:05.66]Yay, games.
[42:06.81]I would just like to apologize.
[42:08.77]I had a plan.
[42:10.51]I thought it could work.
[42:11.44]I wanted to see what two demos could do, but then Shrugger dodged everything anyone ever shot.
[42:18.99]Tag is slowly walking out of the room, disappointed in his performance.
[42:22.24]Tag, come over here.
[42:22.76]I want to get to...
[42:23.97]Close match interview.
[42:25.23]Alright, we're going to go on to another game.
[42:27.16]I think it has to be better than that one, or at least closer.
[42:29.52]That was fun.
[42:30.04]I still had fun.
[42:31.34]Yeah, the engineer, Jordan, he was great.
[42:33.67]He was like a seventh man there.
[42:35.11]I could be getting by next time on new engies.
[42:37.45]You know, Jordan picked an amazing team.
[42:41.10]But we learned from the errors.
[42:43.76]We learned why it was bad.
[42:47.55]Real quick, what's the next map?
[42:49.14]I don't know what the next map is.
[42:50.24]I haven't been told yet.
[42:51.94]Next map is Process.
[42:54.45]I'm on point over here.
[42:56.29]I don't know if I have that in here.
[42:57.97]Long open map.
[42:59.64]Process, Process, Process.
[43:02.26]You should see the smile on Milo's face right now.
[43:04.86]It's so big.
[43:05.93]He's so happy.
[43:06.85]He's so happy.
[43:08.47]Can you guys hear me?
[43:09.25]No.
[43:09.43]We can't hear you now.
[43:11.34]Sorry.
[43:11.48]Real quick, guys, before we get into the second game, we are at $195,406.
[43:17.59]Let's get to $200,000.
[43:20.07]It's real.
[43:20.87]It's happening.
[43:21.51]It's happening soon.
[43:23.03]Get those donations in.
[43:24.10]We have so much cool stuff that you guys can win.
[43:26.42]And this final push...
[43:28.06]I can't even say enough.
[43:29.76]I think we're going to get 200,000.
[43:32.03]This is the end of day two, the final day.
[43:34.53]This is our last chance to get your chances in here.
[43:39.10]One of our fabulous donations.
[43:40.80]Who would have ever thought that Team Fortress 2, we played a little CS Source, but not really.
[43:46.28]We unboxed nothing.
[43:48.19]And then there was some surfing.
[43:49.09]But really, it's been TF2.
[43:50.61]$200,000 almost has been raised.
[43:53.39]Yeah, and it goes towards a great cause, one-step camp.
[43:56.08]I mean, it's going to be amazing.
[43:57.66]So keep the donations in.
[43:59.28]I would like to read them, but we're going to keep the action going.
[44:01.32]In fact, I think we're ready for the second game, so we're going to go right into the picks and bans here.
[44:05.45]I think that means that Jerma gets the first ban, I believe.
[44:11.54]I'm fairly certain of that, right?
[44:13.96]Yes, I think Star banned the first one.
[44:15.39]Yeah, I banned first last time.
[44:17.07]You grab the first ban over here.
[44:19.15]Okay, first ban.
[44:21.98]Let me take a look.
[44:25.17]Alright.
[44:27.17]See, this is going to be... First ban.
[44:37.32]It's obvious, dude.
[44:39.13]Is it, though?
[44:39.65]It's so obvious.
[44:41.73]But I don't know.
[44:42.33]What if you don't pick that person?
[44:44.80]There's a lot of people to pick.
[44:46.40]Yeah, but what if you don't pick that person?
[44:48.18]That's like... I'm playing mind games here.
[44:51.22]Here we go.
[44:51.49]I'm going to ban...
[44:56.67]This is the hardest decision of my entire life.
[45:02.98]I know.
[45:03.60]The pressure is on, especially after that one.
[45:05.42]I'm going to ban Seagull.
[45:07.79]Seagull?
[45:08.39]That's a good one.
[45:09.41]Dude, that was a good one.
[45:11.75]You know, I respect that.
[45:16.02]Alright, Seagull's banned.
[45:17.22]So, Ster is going to ban Mr. Slin, and we're going to move on.
[45:21.96]Uh...
[45:24.16]Or will he?
[45:25.00]Am I?
[45:25.95]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[45:28.25]Hey, everybody listen.
[45:30.49]I'm banning Blaze.
[45:33.14]Ooh.
[45:34.52]Blaze gets banned.
[45:35.50]Alright.
[45:39.49]And what does that mean now?
[45:40.81]I need to ban... He's still on the table, but I don't want to leave him there.
[45:49.76]Clockwork, you're banned.
[45:51.33]Wow.
[45:52.61]Alright.
[45:54.04]You were going to first pick them.
[45:58.62]I have my hand to the Bible.
[46:01.95]I don't think I was going to.
[46:03.25]Really?
[46:04.01]Oh, damn it.
[46:05.59]See, I'm double blind gaming you, and I got one more ban.
[46:09.28]And I have just the person in mind who's sitting on the couch waiting to be banned.
[46:18.52]It's Mr. Slin!
[46:19.78]Oh, it's too bad, because Mr. Slin already got up.
[46:22.64]Oh, he's still banned, so it's fine.
[46:24.05]You win, but Banny's actually sitting here now.
[46:26.57]Why did you ban Mr. Slin?
[46:28.17]His eyes just got really wide, because he wants to play TF2.
[46:30.61]So, just pointing that out.
[46:31.68]Alright, Mr. Slin is banned.
[46:33.36]Yeah, you can just go home, Slin.
[46:38.47]I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm not nice to anyone.
[46:41.15]Why are you not nice?
[46:43.31]I don't know what happened to me.
[46:45.70]I think that means I'm first pick, actually, because Jermban first.
[46:50.07]That is what it means.
[46:51.47]Yep.
[46:52.56]We're here.
[46:54.04]We're here on the map.
[46:57.25]On the process.
[46:58.88]I'm picking Banny first, you know?
[47:00.84]Oh, thank you.
[47:01.99]I need you to pull my shit out of the garbage.
[47:06.73]I can advise you on the rest of the picks if you want.
[47:09.87]No.
[47:11.04]You need to get a few more subscribers before you do these picks.
[47:16.72]Okay.
[47:16.84]That's motivation.
[47:20.33]Alright, Banny, the first pick.
[47:21.91]Team Jerma is going to pick.
[47:28.60]Let me take a good long look at this.
[47:30.60]This is process, right?
[47:37.84]Yep.
[47:41.58]Okay, I'm going to go with
[47:46.67]I'm going to go with Messer.
[47:48.05]Go.
[47:48.77]Messer.
[47:50.46]First pick, Messer.
[47:51.44]I don't know if this guy's played TF2 in five years.
[47:54.22]I really don't know.
[47:55.00]You know what?
[47:55.66]He was so good back in the day.
[47:57.12]My playbook said that specifically.
[48:00.25]Bill Belichick asks Jerma to take a risk.
[48:03.27]Bring him out.
[48:04.07]Risk reward.
[48:05.75]Alright.
[48:06.73]Stern.
[48:07.85]I know who it is already.
[48:09.21]I know that I want Max.
[48:14.08]max process a long map with a lot of good sight lines max one of the best snipers I'm sorry blood sire like blood sire has been insane in every pub like he's been on point well don't worry don't worry because blood sire is on my team that's my wow the rick flair woo from the corner blood sire is happy he's getting it in the games he's gonna play they picked the short guy yes
[48:37.69]Alright.
[48:38.43]You know Max is like 6'4"?
[48:40.57]Of course he is.
[48:41.37]Everyone is in TF2.
[48:41.97]So was Abraham Lincoln.
[48:43.47]We're doing good here.
[48:44.75]Give me my boy, Mr. Pharaoh.
[48:51.26]Alright.
[48:51.62]Star's boy, Pharaoh.
[48:58.30]Okay.
[48:58.44]Then I'm going to take... Let's take Indust.
[49:08.60]I think I've got the plan here.
[49:18.52]I've got it figured out and I'm going to take Platinum.
[49:29.41]Do you actually want Platinum or do you want Admirable wearing Platinum's face across his chest?
[49:34.13]I do not under any circumstances want Admirable unless he's pretending to be on Jerma's team.
[49:40.04]Pretending?
[49:41.44]Yeah, just you're not even actually on it, you're pretending to be on it.
[49:45.67]Is Platinum playing Soldier or Demo?
[49:46.91]I can't tell with his thing.
[49:47.95]He's actually on Soldier.
[49:49.35]Okay.
[49:54.02]Okay.
[49:55.85]I got a dog here that's helping me out.
[49:57.91]He's making some noises.
[49:58.79]He's giving me some good clues.
[50:04.38]Tag, in a moment of desperation and being fed up, asks, why would he pick a serious team the second time?
[50:13.34]He learned, Tag.
[50:15.68]Look at the chemistry.
[50:16.54]Last year I went too hard.
[50:26.98]Frank or Z. Frank or Z. Frank or Z is in.
[50:37.28]I'm going to go with... What a guy.
[50:40.20]You've got a great team here.
[50:44.53]Let's get Sideshow in there.
[50:47.11]Sideshow?
[50:48.80]Well-cured.
[50:50.00]Wow.
[50:50.38]Didn't see that pick coming.
[50:53.18]I also did not see that pick coming.
[50:55.52]I was looking in a mirror.
[51:00.49]I couldn't see much else.
[51:02.67]I think my team is too good.
[51:07.66]I think this is the pick that takes them down a little bit.
[51:14.65]I'm going to go with Satan on Pyro.
[51:17.38]Satan on Pyro.
[51:22.52]I mean, you spend that much time in the underworld, I mean, you know a thing or two about pyro.
[51:25.91]Yeah, I mean, second nature to him.
[51:29.89]Alright.
[51:30.41]And not to say Satan's so bad, I'm taking it down a notch.
[51:36.12]Just getting the pyro in there.
[51:37.60]Pyro, not traditional.
[51:39.07]I don't want to be a meaner right now.
[51:40.63]It's like the best pyro in the game.
[51:42.17]Yeah.
[51:44.21]I think, I don't know, I think I might be going to a scout here.
[51:48.84]Ooh.
[51:53.06]And that is actually what I'm... Sizer.
[51:55.39]Oh my god.
[51:56.83]No, dude, I knew... I saw into the future.
[51:58.37]I know right now Sizer is begging you to pick you.
[52:01.17]All sorts of... Because he doesn't want to be on my team.
[52:03.50]He was so disappointed at my picks last time, he said he doesn't want to be on my team anymore.
[52:08.96]Wow.
[52:11.43]So I just got one medic left to pick.
[52:17.54]Ninja Nick.
[52:21.80]I would've got Slynn, but I think he's banned.
[52:25.23]I was gonna pick Slynn, too.
[52:27.47]I know you were.
[52:28.97]I was, like, lining up for Mr. Slynn.
[52:33.42]Alright, so my final... Let me take a look.
[52:36.14]Probably... This is very important.
[52:50.58]This is extremely important.
[52:54.62]Show no mercy.
[52:56.97]I need to... This is going to be a pick.
[53:00.05]This is going to be a pick that you'll never see coming.
[53:04.38]Okay?
[53:05.14]Just know that.
[53:06.26]Closing my eyes.
[53:07.53]Close your eyes.
[53:08.79]Look in the mirror.
[53:09.47]Close your eyes because here comes Sigafoo.
[53:11.96]Oh, my God.
[53:12.90]No demo, man.
[53:15.84]No demo.
[53:16.96]We're going no demo.
[53:18.34]So the NG Scout Soldier Medic Sniper Scout Team.
[53:25.34]I don't know.
[53:25.66]You better believe it.
[53:26.43]Hey, this is process.
[53:27.51]They do a blood sire.
[53:29.96]They do.
[53:30.94]Looks like Ster has an incredibly good team.
[53:33.87]Everybody, this is Banny.
[53:34.89]He'll be playing in this game.
[53:35.79]I will.
[53:36.49]And he's going to go right now.
[53:37.23]And I think we're subbing in for you the tall bald man or the tall shaved man.
[53:42.20]Or not.
[53:42.63]Or yes or no.
[53:43.31]Or yes or no.
[53:44.85]Banny very happy.
[53:46.41]Banny just wants to win, win, win.
[53:48.28]He's ready to win, win, win.
[53:49.40]We are creeping up to 196.
[53:52.09]We want to get to 200,000.
[53:54.13]That's good, but it's not 200,000.
[53:55.43]It's not 200,000.
[53:56.71]It's really good.
[53:57.58]I expect more from your Twitch chat.
[53:59.10]Wow.
[53:59.62]We're calling out the Twitch chat.
[54:01.78]This is going to be on process.
[54:03.03]Hello, Mr. Mike.
[54:03.95]Hi.
[54:04.67]How's your back?
[54:06.09]It's still there.
[54:07.54]Still feeling awesome?
[54:09.32]Yeah.
[54:09.52]Yeah.
[54:10.44]I'm in Chicago.
[54:11.43]I would like to get a couple of these donations read while we have a chance, while people are getting into the servers, because we are getting quite a few of them in right now.
[54:18.06]Remember, we still have all of our incentives up.
[54:20.30]You can donate, get in on these raffles.
[54:22.61]Those are going to come to an end pretty soon.
[54:24.33]We still have the auction.
[54:25.33]We have a couple one-of-one hats that you guys can go get.
[54:28.44]And we also have a couple signed items from Ster in Jerma.
[54:31.82]If you want to spend quite a bit of money on any one of those items.
[54:35.35]They're expensive but awesome and certainly one of a kind.
[54:39.09]Do they make you play any better?
[54:40.21]Do they have any special properties?
[54:42.40]Yeah.
[54:43.28]Give you 15 extra health.
[54:45.28]Yes.
[54:46.74]Thanks for asking.
[54:53.51]We have auctions, guys.
[54:54.51]They're closing in 10 minutes.
[54:56.60]Oh, that's what he said in the thing.
[54:57.70]Yes.
[54:58.76]The auctions are closing in 10 minutes, and we've talked about this all through the day.
[55:02.38]As of right now, you've got 10 minutes to go and join and put your bids in for the auctions.
[55:07.81]And how do they do that, Mike?
[55:08.93]Well, I'm glad you asked.
[55:10.56]You go to the Steam group, the discussions, and that's where it's all located.
[55:13.84]It's the tip of the hat, Steam group.
[55:15.82]There are items signed by some of our pubber.
[55:19.51]It's rude to call StarDream a pubbers.
[55:21.49]YouTubers.
[55:22.20]That's really mean.
[55:23.38]That was rude.
[55:23.98]That's not really mean.
[55:24.56]That's going to beat me up.
[55:25.50]But you got 10 minutes.
[55:26.76]There's a craft number one tipped lid.
[55:29.29]There's a ton more stuff.
[55:31.07]I haven't even looked at all of them because there's several.
[55:33.09]These are auctions.
[55:33.80]You know what you're bidding for, so there's no randomness.
[55:36.64]Go do it right now.
[55:37.34]10 minutes from this second.
[55:39.07]Now it's less than 10 minutes.
[55:40.39]Yeah, and also, guys, if you bid and you get outbid, there's still a chance that you might win it because sometimes, or I think last year, there was only one person, which is, I think, pretty phenomenal, that didn't pay.
[55:51.77]And so if the person who wins it doesn't pay, then the next person gets the item.
[55:55.95]So it's like, oh, I got outbid, so whatever, I'm done.
[55:58.74]But you still might win.
[55:59.54]Anyway, let me read a couple of these before we get into it.
[56:01.94]I'm not sure how we're standing.
[56:03.53]Bloodsire's not even into TF2 yet.
[56:05.43]He's trying to figure out... He moved to the 120 Hz monitor because that helps a lot for all of you that don't know.
[56:13.85]You can see him right there shifting around, wearing his extra small shirt, being a gamer.
[56:18.60]He's going to have to do some hard lifting, I think, or heavy lifting.
[56:21.14]Oh, and hey, let me toss this in as well.
[56:23.40]Raffle-wise, there's some raffle entries still open as well.
[56:27.11]Auctions and raffles.
[56:28.89]People will see this stuff when they go in through the tracker to make their donations.
[56:32.08]We're not done yet.
[56:33.32]There's still stuff to give away.
[56:35.10]When we get to the end of the tip of the hats, there's usually like a pile of stuff that is still there to be won.
[56:42.25]So I just wanted to put that out there.
[56:43.93]Those are the auctions that are ending.
[56:45.16]The raffles aren't in ten minutes.
[56:46.72]Yeah, sure.
[56:51.34]I'm being told raffles.
[56:54.09]I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly the auctions.
[56:57.13]Okay.
[56:57.68]Well, anyway, let me read a couple of these while we have a chance here.
[57:00.38]So this is just from Paola who said, been watching a lot of the stream.
[57:04.92]Thank you so much for making this weekend entertaining, especially for a great cause.
[57:08.17]I just got into the game and Jerma and Star's videos basically introduced me to such a great community.
[57:13.34]So shout out to them.
[57:14.72]And we're getting just a ton of those type of donation comments of,
[57:18.68]you know, liking to, you know, inside jokes of Star and Jerma's YouTube videos, but really saying that, you know, they were the reason that they're watching slash are part of the community.
[57:27.80]And that's really cool to see.
[57:28.62]And I know Star and Jerma really appreciate all their fans and all the people that say the kind of things about us.
[57:33.22]Whatever gets you here.
[57:34.30]Yeah.
[57:34.94]And that's just, there's a lot of people that follow that.
[57:37.89]Like Grittison the Gay, who says, Jerma versus Star, Jerma versus Star, Jerma versus Star, everybody wants to see it happen.
[57:44.08]This is a way of doing it.
[57:45.10]That's pretty funny.
[57:46.58]Yeah.
[57:47.28]The pressure is on like never before.
[57:49.78]Well, you picked a murderer's row of teams.
[57:51.75]Jerm, are you afraid of this very, very strong team that Starz picked?
[58:01.10]I'm going to take that as a yes.
[58:02.44]He's dead.
[58:02.76]He's still, like, thinking about the picks, like, what did I do wrong?
[58:05.64]Maybe cardiac arrest.
[58:06.71]He's just on the floor.
[58:07.57]He had to go to the bathroom.
[58:09.05]Okay.
[58:09.63]To have a heart attack type emergency.
[58:12.35]He's actually muted.
[58:13.33]If you don't realize, you're muted.
[58:14.82]Oh, wow.
[58:15.74]Okay.
[58:16.10]Okay.
[58:16.18]So the fear overwhelmed him and he's actually mute.
[58:20.25]He's just panicking.
[58:21.77]You'd hear him pacing his room.
[58:24.41]People are rallying around in the donation comments for Jerma.
[58:27.66]Aaron Rose says, beat him up, Jerma.
[58:29.34]$20 donation.
[58:30.87]That $20 will give Aaron one of those pins.
[58:34.27]A jaunty pin.
[58:35.13]A jaunty pin.
[58:36.06]If you donate $20 or more,
[58:38.94]I guess at one time, or if you donate, say, $5 four times, you are going to get a jaunty pin.
[58:44.61]I got my jaunty pin.
[58:45.45]You got yours?
[58:46.35]No.
[58:47.45]Well, I got a donate.
[58:48.49]When are you going to donate?
[58:49.28]Well, I have $100 riding right now, so this could end it right now.
[58:51.92]Guys, can we... Twitch chat needs to tell Seaver to get his sugar together here and get his freaking donation in.
[58:57.61]We're in the server, so I don't know if Jerma is praying to a god.
[59:02.33]I'm sorry.
[59:03.32]I'm back.
[59:04.58]I don't know if anyone was trying to talk to me.
[59:06.00]My dog.
[59:06.30]I had to let my dog out.
[59:07.86]No?
[59:07.94]Okay.
[59:08.06]I'm here.
[59:10.08]Alright.
[59:10.94]Here we go.
[59:11.30]The game is underway.
[59:12.68]Bloodsire is using the classic.
[59:15.31]Bloodsire is using the classic here.
[59:16.81]We do have Satan.
[59:17.49]We're watching this perspective.
[59:19.16]He's whipping flares across the game.
[59:25.25]SIGIFU, NO MERCY.
[59:27.37]WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS COUNTER SNIPER MAX.
[59:29.08]AND THERE'S A RANGLED CENTURY.
[59:30.28]MAX IS ABLE TO DROP SIGIFU.
[59:32.07]AND HEADS ARE GOING TO BE ROLLING IN THIS GAME BETWEEN BLOODSIRE AND SIGIFU, TWO VERY GOOD SNIPERS.
[59:36.84]BANNY'S GOT Crit-a-Cola.
[59:38.82]BLOODSIRE, THOUGH.
[59:40.25]That's why Bandy was getting animated earlier.
[59:42.23]We are out of the delay, but I can see in real time the players react to things.
[59:45.85]And Meyer, what do you think about this matchup so far?
[59:49.04]Team Star coming out of the gates, looking strong.
[59:53.18]Saito with the gimmick, trying to come in for the market guard.
[59:56.25]Can't connect it.
[59:57.31]So close, though.
[59:58.47]How did he miss?
[59:59.37]Must have been the ping, man.
[60:00.31]He's playing from England.
[60:02.21]That's true.
[60:02.71]We only blamed the ping a few hundred times today, so we'll make it 158.
[60:05.70]If a Euro ever misses, it was the ping.
[60:10.02]more uh... quick fiction I think it's important that's in fact one of the Quick-Fix it is uh... perhaps the best medical
[60:18.91]Yeah, I gotta say, actually, I'm really, like, happy to see people trying some new things, but also with matchmaking on the horizon and nothing potentially going to be banned from matchmaking, this could actually be maybe a little bit more representative of, like, you can take advantage of all this stuff probably very soon.
[60:35.19]We've got a cowmangler over here, too, don't we?
[60:37.23]Oh, my God.
[60:39.09]Bloodsire AA says goodbye to Platinum.
[60:42.65]Wow.
[60:43.17]What a close-range AA shot.
[60:45.00]We could see the sequel 20 years later, guys.
[60:49.06]Max, though, his counterpart's going to be able to drop him with a Jurati mini-crit kill, if that was what that was, at least a mini-crit.
[60:55.31]And he's going to go far left, looking for a shot.
[60:57.68]Max, one of the best Highlander snipers ever.
[60:59.42]And hopefully we can show why right here as I praised him.
[61:03.62]Oh, we'll miss the Engineer.
[61:04.97]It's hard to miss that flaming head, but Max has managed to do it a couple times there.
[61:08.61]Very close, but it's not going to matter.
[61:09.67]Team Star is going to walk on the point, put their little footsies on it, and win.
[61:15.02]1-0, Ster.
[61:16.84]How does it feel, Star, to finally get around?
[61:19.47]Um, I feel this team's taking it like another 5-0.
[61:23.30]Like, we're just going to have back-to-back.
[61:25.80]I think it was an 8-0.
[61:27.93]Well, if it goes that far, it'll go that far.
[61:30.47]But someone's going to call an end to it because there's going to be so much blood.
[61:35.00]We have bomb medics.
[61:37.04]They just needed to spin it around to get familiar with what, you know, everything's going on.
[61:42.61]Oh, good.
[61:43.57]Red team looking to be in shambles here.
[61:45.71]We see Sigafu just barreling in.
[61:47.31]He's actually able to drop the pyro.
[61:48.70]That's going to be the only kill at mid.
[61:50.58]The whip is out.
[61:51.18]Platinum is smacking his team.
[61:52.74]He's making them go quick.
[61:54.80]We have marshmallows being consumed.
[61:58.61]He's just demolishing this bag of marshmallows.
[62:01.57]I thought you were laughing at the concept of dropping a pyro on a mid.
[62:06.96]The only death.
[62:07.80]That was a pretty nice right click.
[62:09.40]I saw the right click from the Cow Mangler.
[62:12.70]the charge shot.
[62:13.98]And Ninja Nick has his Quick-Fix ready.
[62:15.55]Both medics, of course, are running that useful tool.
[62:18.56]And he's going to be able to heal at an alarming rate at some point should he decide to pop it.
[62:24.63]Looks like a slow push.
[62:25.83]Oh, hey.
[62:26.93]Mezzer is going to turn the corner and say hello to a Loch and Lode pipe from your home country, or I guess no.
[62:34.01]That's Scottish, isn't it?
[62:35.49]I'm Ulster skeleton.
[62:37.33]Bloodsire.
[62:38.37]He's playing very well right now.
[62:39.70]He just gave me the look and the nod.
[62:41.12]He's come to play.
[62:42.90]One of the few Team Jerma members that are.
[62:45.91]He's going to die here to Platinum and it looks like it's going to be another round here pending some heroics.
[62:50.41]I don't think so.
[62:51.11]Messer's going to get put into the ceiling and shot.
[62:53.55]Many crits galore.
[62:54.48]Banny on a 48k.
[62:55.96]But there is a wrangled level 9 sentry gun.
[62:59.00]Sizer gets reflected by Satan.
[63:01.66]No one can cap this thing.
[63:05.33]He is so good, but it's just...
[63:07.78]Boy, it's almost impossible to kill a wrangled level three sentry gun, as all of us know.
[63:13.04]But it's also hard to win when you don't have a team alive.
[63:16.69]It's the banning effect, man.
[63:17.75]When was the last time Grunvinson lost off lane?
[63:20.53]Here he is in person playing here.
[63:22.86]I think he's just, he's the talisman.
[63:25.02]Jermo, how are you feeling right now?
[63:26.42]Does your team have a comeback in them?
[63:28.80]I think there's still potential.
[63:30.91]I don't know.
[63:33.23]You've got to get banning off this game.
[63:36.35]Banny taking this game very seriously, running the regular Scattergun.
[63:40.13]And Bloodsire is able to drop the medic there with a fully charged body shot and platinum from the double kill.
[63:45.48]There it is.
[63:46.30]He's making eyes at the casting couch.
[63:49.32]Bloodsire, how's your back?
[63:50.82]How's your back over there?
[63:52.16]Mom, get the camera.
[63:53.35]Heavy lifting for Bloodsire.
[63:54.93]And he's going to get shot easily by Banny, who is just murdering everybody on the map.
[63:59.63]Sideshow has the Cow Mangler now.
[64:01.54]I'm not sure if he was the one that was using it or if he's joined in.
[64:04.12]Yeah, he was.
[64:04.96]Okay, so he's still using that awesome item.
[64:06.79]I really, I don't understand it.
[64:08.77]I mean, I know what it is, but the skin, what it's shooting.
[64:12.00]It's just a rocket launcher.
[64:13.28]I get it, but like it's shooting cow lasers.
[64:16.42]I don't know.
[64:16.93]Space stuff.
[64:18.83]Space projectiles.
[64:21.54]I vouch for Saito.
[64:22.52]I recommend him as a player for this event.
[64:25.70]And he is not disappointed so far.
[64:28.07]Another fully charged guy.
[64:29.81]You might want to ask Jerma if that's true or not.
[64:33.10]Both medics have... Oh, there's a Kritzkrieg actually in the hands of Indus, and that is a good thing.
[64:37.10]Oh, here comes Sigafoo.
[64:38.43]With the Kritzkrieg... I don't remember the name of that gun.
[64:42.11]The Widowmaker.
[64:43.29]Inferno as long as he hits.
[64:44.72]Look at this.
[64:45.62]And if you don't do enough damage, it takes metal.
[64:47.80]And wow, that just cleaned up.
[64:49.60]Max is still alive, though.
[64:50.51]Does drop.
[64:51.01]Max is still alive, though.
[64:52.13]Says goodbye to Sizer.
[64:53.21]Can he make it three?
[64:54.17]They're finally going to bomb him.
[64:55.77]But Max gets a sudden double kill.
[64:57.58]And that's going to even it up a little bit.
[64:59.10]Mezzer has the force of nature out.
[65:01.22]Admirable.
[65:01.82]A gun that I haven't seen a lot of in a long time.
[65:04.69]But Mezzer likes it.
[65:06.71]Yeah, you got some extra movement potential there, but in a straight-up fight, you know, you'd expect Banny's scattergun to win.
[65:19.60]What is life over there, gentlemen?
[65:21.92]I don't understand.
[65:23.16]There's abuse being traded here across monitors between Banny and Bloodsire.
[65:27.77]both times in disbelief.
[65:29.17]He's just taking his hands off the mice and keyboard.
[65:30.76]He doesn't know what to do.
[65:31.88]Well, Satan with a big flank, he's actually just going to go light everybody on fire and back off.
[65:35.89]Does battle with his arch nemesis, the Engineer, and brings him to hell.
[65:39.77]And brings Sizer to hell with him, too.
[65:42.04]Wow, a double kill with the flare gun.
[65:45.60]That's not the flare gun.
[65:46.26]That's the one that explodes.
[65:48.08]Remarkable what's that one called?
[65:49.59]The Scorch Shot?
[65:50.33]The Detonator.
[65:51.09]The Detonator?
[65:51.47]Thank you.
[65:52.88]This game used to be easier to know when there's like 10 items out of 10,000.
[65:57.39]Get that cap!
[65:58.87]Get that cap!
[65:59.33]That cap for Sideshow!
[66:01.04]Oh, my God.
[66:01.80]Fist pump coming in for a marble.
[66:03.30]His boy does something in the game.
[66:04.84]Biffs a jump a little bit.
[66:05.80]He's going in towards last.
[66:07.85]Oh, boy.
[66:08.47]Oh, that would have been so incredible.
[66:11.39]Sideshow hit the trap card, and Banny murdered him.
[66:14.28]InDust is going to get an Ubersaw onto Pharoah, onto mid, and this game has actually gotten a lot closer, so Jerma has faith in his team, and they've tightened up and putting on a much better show here.
[66:22.83]Backcaps playing a little scrappy, but Bloodsire gets it.
[66:25.82]They're figuring it out.
[66:26.78]I mean, he's pocketing Sigafoo, and it's working.
[66:30.57]When you can fire, like, 80 shots.
[66:33.51]Ooh!
[66:34.99]Max, though, with the headshot.
[66:36.45]Three kills in a row for him.
[66:37.55]Satan is coming in.
[66:38.01]He's going to have to deal with his last scout.
[66:40.85]And he will do that with a... Powerjack.
[66:44.52]You need some help?
[66:45.92]Dude, I'm so sorry.
[66:46.74]Like, this is not the mode for old Seabears.
[66:50.33]I know Powerjack.
[66:50.93]I just don't remember the name.
[66:51.85]That came out a long, long time ago.
[66:54.73]I don't know.
[66:55.17]Star, are you worried?
[66:57.01]I have zero concerns.
[66:59.00]Zero concerns.
[67:01.18]If things get too hot, my boys will handle it.
[67:04.86]I think that's probably accurate.
[67:08.03]My team's putting up a fight right now.
[67:11.45]That's all I can ask.
[67:12.28]That's all I can ask of my team.
[67:14.20]Go up, do your best.
[67:16.33]You know, whatever happens, happens.
[67:17.93]Don't use the classic.
[67:20.47]My god, please win.
[67:23.53]No, I'm kidding.
[67:26.86]No, I'm kidding.
[67:27.32]Lose.
[67:27.82]It was just Platinum in there.
[67:33.73]I don't think there is a blue team.
[67:36.36]I kind of forgot Platinum was playing.
[67:37.66]That's the first time he's been on camera at least.
[67:40.27]Alright, real quick, just so we make sure people know, we are the 30-minute warning for the raffles.
[67:46.05]Those are ending at 11.59 Eastern or 10.59 Central.
[67:51.36]And that's all the raffles, I believe, unless I'm told otherwise.
[67:54.47]So if you want to get money in in time to be eligible to win, all this awesome stuff that we have being raffled off, you have 30 minutes to do that.
[68:02.68]So get in on it, boys.
[68:04.36]We are creeping towards that $200,000 goal.
[68:08.25]We are under $3,000 away as the blue team is pushing in.
[68:12.19]Scrappy fight here by Team Jerma, but Max is heating up.
[68:15.05]He's on a 6K spree.
[68:16.22]Oh, my goodness.
[68:17.26]He is just unstoppable right now, but they're going to try to get himself.
[68:19.98]Miser gets his head ripped off.
[68:22.51]What is life right now?
[68:25.23]Unbelievable play and there's a sentry gun doing all it can.
[68:28.80]Miser is shooting.
[68:30.04]Max does go down finally to Bloodsire who has the answer for his sniper counterpart and that is a gwadishwat.
[68:37.15]Satan is everywhere doing everything but they still haven't capped.
[68:40.26]I'm not sure what's going on.
[68:41.99]Big Mezzer stepping up there with the 2K.
[68:44.93]Team Star down to two players.
[68:46.81]We're going to see the push out here from Team Jerma.
[68:48.77]They're finally starting to get something going.
[68:51.44]This could be the turning point.
[68:53.96]Platinum gets turned into Goo, or I guess Dust, and the Cowmangler 5000.
[68:58.14]Sideshow's jumping up to try to cap this point here.
[69:01.59]He's going to have to deal with a Max in a little bit.
[69:03.59]He wants to rip his head off his shoulders.
[69:05.17]We'll see if he does.
[69:06.45]They're going to get that cap, so Team Jerma.
[69:09.19]much more resilient than I thought.
[69:11.05]They're holding right in here as we look at there's 9 minutes and 40 seconds left.
[69:14.63]They're going to have to do more than just hold ground as Banny is rolling in trying to get behind with the bonk energy drink and he's in a 2v1 and actually lose that to Sigafu who is a really, really good DM engineer and he's actually probably the MVP of Team Jerma.
[69:30.83]Would you say so, Jerma, your NG superstar?
[69:33.16]Jerma's biased to engineers.
[69:34.78]Oh, MVP, last one, engineer.
[69:36.54]I just love NGs.
[69:37.94]Well, I just want to
[69:38.38]Here's why.
[69:41.21]Here's why.
[69:41.67]You're about to see why.
[69:42.49]Well, after this.
[69:45.07]Next time.
[69:45.67]You'll see it.
[69:46.65]After he's done getting blown up.
[69:48.07]Alright.
[69:49.50]Still, this cap, I have faith.
[69:53.50]Bloodsire taking these.
[69:55.90]Oh, he just got headshot by Max and shut down.
[69:59.63]Just can't get it rolling, Dermot.
[70:02.63]Well, they haven't lost.
[70:03.75]They're doing great.
[70:06.73]How long is left on the clock here?
[70:08.02]It's kind of obscured.
[70:08.92]It's hard to see it.
[70:09.54]It's right underneath the tipped lid.
[70:11.01]But I believe it's like 8.40.
[70:12.53]Yeah, it's 8.40.
[70:14.18]Loads of time.
[70:15.00]Loads of time.
[70:15.95]And Mesler and company are going to do all they can.
[70:20.28]You need to get something going here.
[70:21.33]He does have a sentry gun set up.
[70:23.15]Doing quite a bit of damage, actually.
[70:24.27]He's going to help take down Platinum and the Medic, so Messer and the Engineer, the unstoppable duo, the combo is down.
[70:30.62]Star, you're getting a little worried.
[70:32.09]Your team seems to be playing a little goofy, a little without care.
[70:35.97]That's what I'm saying.
[70:36.71]When the heat comes... They'll try again?
[70:38.80]I think they're going to try really hard.
[70:40.22]I don't think... Like, Banny would cry tonight if he lost.
[70:43.27]He probably would, and he doesn't know how not to try.
[70:45.85]We'll see.
[70:47.35]There's a lot of people in the sewer.
[70:48.51]At least one.
[70:48.91]There's a pyro in there.
[70:50.17]He's not going to the sewer.
[70:51.63]There's a guy with a flamethrower in there, and we're going to kill him, though, because Mezzer is warming up.
[70:55.86]Returning to his old form.
[70:56.94]Medic caught out, though, and Indus does go down to Banny, who is jumping around, dealing out the meat shots.
[71:02.86]The sword has come out.
[71:03.83]He is slicing and dicing.
[71:05.43]Six health.
[71:06.79]He'll die.
[71:07.51]Killed himself because he stabbed himself accidentally.
[71:10.07]Cut his wrist there.
[71:11.37]Platinum has the...
[71:13.25]Beggar's Bazooka?
[71:15.24]Beggar's Bazooka.
[71:15.74]You can shoot more than one rocket at once.
[71:17.42]Thank you very much.
[71:18.50]I like the Sigafoo strategy.
[71:20.10]Look at the strat.
[71:22.15]He's being a corner creep.
[71:22.99]I like that.
[71:24.29]Looking for Sigafoo right now on our stream.
[71:26.31]He has crits and a gun.
[71:30.00]Oh, he's going for the medic.
[71:30.84]He just walks right by Max.
[71:32.68]Oh, doesn't kill him.
[71:33.22]He's got the fists out now.
[71:34.96]Oh, my God.
[71:35.66]He's trying to punch his way.
[71:37.15]Does finally kill Max.
[71:39.61]Jerma cheering on his team.
[71:41.30]That Mini-Sentry is still there.
[71:44.66]Cap going down.
[71:45.76]Pharaoh whipping bowling balls out.
[71:49.79]Looks like that's going to go.
[71:50.97]Parachutes opened up.
[71:52.79]Unlocks galore here.
[71:53.85]Yeah, those are cannonballs, CBR, not bowling balls.
[71:56.88]You tell them you can't bowl with those?
[71:59.66]If you put your mind to it, I guess you could do anything.
[72:01.65]You got pins right there.
[72:02.73]You could throw a bomb at a pin.
[72:04.35]Goes down.
[72:06.34]Use your imagination.
[72:07.26]That's a good point.
[72:08.13]Thank you.
[72:09.17]And it looks like Team Germany, yet again, pushed back to their last.
[72:12.35]Need to find a way.
[72:13.04]I think going down 3-0 would be tough to come back.
[72:15.78]Saito!
[72:16.26]Oh, another lag miss shovel attempt, and Max takes his head off his shoulders.
[72:20.97]So that lag, Amarable, you know, just so brutal.
[72:23.42]I think Saito's actually just dying.
[72:25.94]Bloodsire behind everybody.
[72:28.67]turns around, winks at the casting coach as he gets a headshot, pulls the knife out, platinum doesn't share.
[72:34.12]He will not turn around.
[72:35.48]Keeping his team in it right now with the push on the other side of last.
[72:38.76]Banny is in on the ground.
[72:40.38]Three shots, Messer.
[72:42.39]It'll be tough for Blue to hold onto this sideshow in this lag.
[72:45.27]We have Bloodsire back on the field.
[72:46.61]He's going to go down.
[72:47.45]Mr. Satan just demolishing, sending people to the underworld.
[72:51.18]But he's in there by himself now.
[72:52.44]He needs to back out.
[72:53.96]Stars team, I think, is performing better, but they just can't cap this last point in Marable.
[73:00.06]Zayn's going to work the flank now.
[73:01.98]He's just going in.
[73:03.19]What is this Medic doing?
[73:05.77]I think they're just throwing right now.
[73:07.18]They seem to have given up all hope here on Team Jerma.
[73:10.48]Don't say that.
[73:11.23]That's not true.
[73:13.45]He's at a momentary lapse of judgment.
[73:16.82]We're down to the 5 minute and 35 seconds as Platinum comes in and evaporates Bloodsire.
[73:24.01]Only two remaining, but it is Sigafu and he's done, he's worked miracles so far.
[73:28.12]I don't know, Jeremiah needs another miracle right here.
[73:31.20]His favorite class, he pulled it out.
[73:33.49]I don't know I don't think so he's still alive somehow just will not die 150 health with the uh with the uh wrangler no mini century hand thank you and uh three zero mini century hand yeah the Gunslinger thank you it's tough this is crunch time now you know three round deficit it's now or never you go for it right well sideshow's gonna pull out the rocket jumper when you go down three zero generally you want to take out the rocket jumper because it does no damage
[73:59.49]He wants to hit one shovel.
[74:02.59]Wow.
[74:03.42]Makes the caster eat his words.
[74:04.90]What a play by Sideshow.
[74:06.90]And, yeah.
[74:09.09]Pretty sick.
[74:09.67]Your boy.
[74:10.19]He's getting a little bit complacent here.
[74:12.01]He's whipped out the BB.
[74:13.33]He got it, but it didn't kill him.
[74:17.29]Sizer gets body shot down by Max.
[74:20.06]Red does have him in there.
[74:20.90]The Quick-Fix is going to get popped.
[74:22.52]Both medics have switched to it.
[74:24.24]Mezzer is putting on a show now.
[74:25.75]Does drop the sniper.
[74:27.53]Sees the Quick-Fix combo.
[74:29.31]And Banning does take care of him.
[74:31.50]Bloodsire looking for a shot.
[74:33.70]Medic snuck by.
[74:38.99]Peed all over that medic.
[74:40.80]Oh, Banny's using the Baby Space Blaster.
[74:43.16]Like, you forget some of these items exist.
[74:45.56]That they're a choice in here until you're like, oh yeah, dude.
[74:48.07]We got mid.
[74:49.29]We got mid.
[74:51.67]Keep the spirits high.
[74:53.13]Keep the momentum going.
[74:54.01]You got it.
[74:54.93]Four minutes to get three caps.
[74:56.21]I think your boys can do it, Jerma.
[74:59.40]Crazy thing to happen.
[75:01.64]Sure.
[75:01.76]But yeah.
[75:03.72]Let's do it.
[75:04.68]Pull out all the stops.
[75:07.50]They're about to get another one right now.
[75:10.74]Team Star getting a little cocky right now.
[75:13.06]Oh, there's Platinum coming in and getting that medic pick.
[75:15.90]Yeah, I've never, I don't remember seeing Platinum using the direct hit too much back in his heyday, but Bloodsire's going to creep in, able to drop Max, and just barely misses a shot right now.
[75:24.50]He's going to dodge some arrows right now.
[75:26.82]Banny's going to take him down.
[75:28.07]And the sentry gun, though, is going to kill Banny.
[75:30.63]And I can actually sense Banny getting a little angry.
[75:32.45]That does not like sentry guns at all.
[75:34.93]They are unfair.
[75:35.69]He's a cheating engineer trying to solo Dream Cap.
[75:38.38]Actually, Mezzer was there as well.
[75:39.92]But Pharaoh's very good.
[75:41.20]Drop stickies everywhere.
[75:42.60]Claps are coming in.
[75:43.40]I don't want to ruin the surprise right here.
[75:47.06]Platinum's trying to run bats with that direct hit.
[75:49.16]Hits the medic down to very low.
[75:50.81]Single digits health.
[75:51.97]It's going to be alright.
[75:52.57]Ninja Nick does have his Quick-Fix.
[75:54.05]Both medics running.
[75:54.79]It's still admirable.
[75:57.03]What's going to happen here?
[75:58.24]The brown bear's coming up behind it.
[75:59.60]He's going to maul them.
[76:01.96]He's in onto Max, kills off that sniper.
[76:06.25]Sizer jumping forward, but the back half's on at the same time.
[76:11.06]We're back at the game.
[76:12.08]Team Jerma, let's go.
[76:14.02]Keep the ball rolling.
[76:15.60]Sizer at the back half.
[76:16.48]Rolling up like a fruit roller.
[76:18.13]What's the time left?
[76:18.89]Is that 3.35?
[76:20.53]That is 2.35.
[76:21.19]2.30.
[76:21.97]That makes it tough, but we'll see.
[76:23.81]That's enough for three rounds.
[76:24.84]Let's go.
[76:25.66]We're going for the win here.
[76:27.38]Team Jerma.
[76:28.33]really help I'm rooting for team start thanks I've got a hundred dollars on what's in the same here he's just got a back-to-back the devil money trial rebate based in the other
[76:45.98]We still have Bloodsire up, still have Indus, both medics are up.
[76:49.93]Satan, oh my goodness, he's just gonna destroy Sigafu.
[76:52.95]And Bloodsire did get out-sniped by Max on the other side of the map, and that should be Team Ster's mid, and probably Team Ster's game, but we do have Indus who's not gonna give it up.
[77:01.63]He's gonna charge Max, and we have a battle medic situation on our hands here.
[77:05.74]We just had a $3,300 donation.
[77:08.42]We had a $3,300 donation, which means we anticipated this could happen.
[77:13.08]If you look top left of the screen, ladies and gentlemen, we have done $200,000.
[77:18.79]Tip of the hat.
[77:21.54]Yes.
[77:23.41]Let's hear it around the world.
[77:26.35]We can get more.
[77:28.19]That's not bad.
[77:28.93]That's pretty good.
[77:30.08]In fact, we are $201,000.
[77:32.38]Let's find that donation right now.
[77:34.46]I believe that was from the auctions, I believe.
[77:36.51]$3,300.
[77:37.99]Those cleared up, and that did indeed push us over.
[77:40.93]So congratulations to everybody, to our community, everybody involved.
[77:46.24]An amazing achievement.
[77:47.74]We're not even done yet, man.
[77:49.08]Not even done yet.
[77:49.92]Yeah, we still have, I think, about 15 minutes or so left.
[77:53.79]About 17 minutes if you want to get on those raffles and get a donation in.
[77:58.18]We still see him filing in.
[77:59.48]Bloodsire with a sick shot onto Ninja Nick.
[78:02.93]Somebody needs to get this Bloodsire guy on an invite roster.
[78:06.20]Wow.
[78:07.40]Max one-ups him possibly with a close-range headshot.
[78:11.51]Indus does kill him off with the Ubersaw, which is going to give him almost a full uber.
[78:16.08]He's at 90% right now.
[78:18.04]Messer looks dangerous with the cleaver in his hand.
[78:20.43]What will he do with that thing?
[78:21.59]He might chop someone's hand off.
[78:24.48]back cap right now, but I don't know if anyone's going to be able to stop it.
[78:26.92]Yeah, they're going to barrel right in there.
[78:28.30]The combo actually will try to stop, and Indus says, you know what, you guys aren't doing it fast enough.
[78:33.11]Oh, Blood Sire with another sick shot.
[78:35.98]Wow, he will get... Did he die there?
[78:38.94]No, he did die.
[78:39.72]I didn't see how he died, Jessa.
[78:40.85]I'm sorry, buddy.
[78:41.81]Big plays, big plays.
[78:43.47]I think there's just not enough time, though, for Team Jerma.
[78:45.96]Put up a heck of a fight, though.
[78:47.76]But in the end... That was a good match.
[78:49.33]I'd say, without the time limit, I think if this went another two or three, I think you would have seen a... Because they clicked.
[78:58.67]They started to really click after that first couple of games.
[79:01.32]Yeah, GG.
[79:02.26]That was a fun game to watch.
[79:03.86]Process seems like we get pretty good games in Process.
[79:07.10]We do have one more Dota Fortress game.
[79:09.85]It's going to be the dreaded 8v8.
[79:12.23]The big one.
[79:12.89]So everybody that's left is going to play.
[79:16.17]So I don't know if we're even banning people.
[79:18.66]I don't think we can, right?
[79:20.04]Because we have 16 people left.
[79:21.80]I do not think we are banning anyone.
[79:23.08]Balls to the wall then.
[79:24.22]Okay, so everyone has to get picked.
[79:25.66]Even more strategy.
[79:27.57]We'll see.
[79:28.39]I'm not sure what the class limit situation is going to be.
[79:30.46]I think there's only going to be one Medic still.
[79:33.60]Do you remember when 8s was a thing?
[79:34.90]8s was a thing at one point.
[79:36.30]Let me put on my TF2 historian hat.
[79:38.34]There used to be, back in the day, a league called STA where we played 3 8s.
[79:43.71]That was the thing.
[79:45.41]Double everything.
[79:46.77]They used to have crits in competitive play too.
[79:49.01]Back.
[79:50.17]Okay, we're going to get right into picking right now.
[79:53.16]$200,000 though, boys.
[79:54.16]What do you think?
[79:54.74]Gosh.
[79:55.52]Let's keep going.
[79:56.38]He nailed it.
[79:57.00]We can get more.
[79:58.22]He's hungry for more.
[79:59.60]Alright, we're going to get right into it so we can start this second game.
[80:02.59]I believe that the first ban is back.
[80:04.85]Well, we don't have any bans.
[80:06.95]No bans.
[80:07.25]I'm going to give, out of the kindness of my heart, Jerma, the first pick.
[80:11.48]Wow.
[80:12.36]This one here is going to be on Viaduct.
[80:14.30]This is Viaduct.
[80:15.12]So King of the Hill Viaduct will be the last map played.
[80:18.65]Well, I mean, there he is.
[80:21.00]He's there.
[80:21.58]He's been sitting.
[80:22.22]He's been banned.
[80:23.88]He hasn't been picked.
[80:25.18]Mr. Slin!
[80:27.12]Everybody thought, you know, he's one of the best players in the entire game.
[80:32.23]You know, it starts with an S. You know, Mr. Slin, baby, first pick.
[80:38.63]Mr. Slin, first pick.
[80:42.00]Oh, my God.
[80:42.96]You always have to follow up with a joke.
[80:45.68]I was being nice, and you...
[80:49.05]Is that like you don't want my first pick?
[80:52.43]Mr. Slim high-fiving Bonnie here.
[80:54.15]The ultimate strategy by Star to give Jerma the first pick, knowing that he would pick someone weird and someone that likes to eat bananas.
[81:01.76]I was going to pick Slim because I felt bad.
[81:03.90]But I guess either way, you got first picked.
[81:06.93]He's so happy right now.
[81:08.45]He's crying.
[81:10.55]Banny consoling him with tears of joy.
[81:12.87]Clockwork.
[81:15.62]This was the plan.
[81:16.94]I get Clockwork on Viaduct.
[81:18.42]A pretty even first pick.
[81:22.19]Slin, pretty much the straight counter to Clockwork.
[81:26.61]So we'll see how that works out for him.
[81:27.87]I love that pick by Jerma.
[81:29.86]Can't wait to see what he picks next.
[81:33.46]Uh... You know what?
[81:35.45]I'm gonna have to think.
[81:36.05]I'm gonna have to think.
[81:36.89]This is 8v8, right?
[81:39.15]Mm-hmm.
[81:39.31]Correct.
[81:39.55]I gotta round this out here.
[81:40.50]Pretty much everyone's getting picked.
[81:41.76]Yeah, I know, but I'm just thinking, like, I gotta... I'm going with the... Get Akuma in there.
[81:48.54]Aw, that was my pick, dude.
[81:49.90]Yep.
[81:50.74]That actually was my pick.
[81:52.48]You gotta think a few picks ahead of time with this, I think.
[81:55.53]Sir, I heard a siren, so someone... Yeah, I'm actually in a hospital right now doing this cast, so I hope you appreciate what I'm doing for everyone.
[82:03.67]For the kids.
[82:05.26]Yeah, I know.
[82:05.82]I gotta get... I gotta get... Zalox.
[82:13.40]I mean, I got $500 on this.
[82:15.40]Wow.
[82:16.94]You can pick both Demoman.
[82:18.12]North American Demoman.
[82:20.34]Very, very, very good.
[82:22.25]Jerma sitting with a Medic and a Spy.
[82:25.19]Seagull.
[82:25.39]What will he pick next?
[82:26.41]Seagull is going to get picked, ladies and gentlemen.
[82:28.43]Good pick.
[82:28.65]That is a good pick.
[82:29.38]He is very good at this map too.
[82:32.76]The ball back in Ster's court.
[82:34.74]Dude, it's... He has an unbelievably good team already.
[82:38.13]Will he pick Blaze?
[82:40.10]I want to go so hard and pick two Demoman again.
[82:43.48]Do it.
[82:43.92]Do it.
[82:45.09]It's Viaduct, dude.
[82:46.93]But like... You basically win.
[82:51.03]I don't want to basically win on the Demoman.
[82:53.81]We did the two Demoman.
[82:54.97]Two Demoman, you can sit out now.
[82:56.86]I'm going to get... This picks from the heart.
[83:03.56]What is Tip of the Heads?
[83:05.20]Oh, boy.
[83:07.00]Ruben.
[83:08.75]Sesko, the big donation earlier.
[83:11.05]He's going to play.
[83:11.92]Scout, he's a very, very good scout too.
[83:14.81]So no slouch.
[83:19.22]Alright.
[83:21.02]Hold on, hold on, hold on, guys.
[83:23.10]Before you're picking, I have to say, apparently Siegel, who is here or was here, can't play.
[83:29.89]So he has to do homework, I'm told.
[83:33.40]So homework has taken Siegel out.
[83:35.26]Hashtag homework.
[83:36.21]I'm not sure what they want to do, if they want to sub in somebody for him or if we want to let Tag play.
[83:41.15]He did really well before, so...
[83:44.87]Brandon has changed his mind the middle has flown in he's taking his perch at the water flocked by a seagull so everyone just calm down This moment he's kind of my ace in the hole right now you're
[84:08.41]Your heart palpitations.
[84:11.75]Nothing against any other players, but Seagull flying in with his majestic wings is going to really scoop this one up, and I write up.
[84:20.08]Like a french fry on the barbed wire.
[84:22.04]Alright, so is it my pick?
[84:23.60]It is your pick, yeah.
[84:25.87]I'm going to go with Deadbolt.
[84:26.69]I need a demo.
[84:27.69]Alright, Deadbolt demo.
[84:28.43]I don't want you to have two.
[84:30.11]I love his portrait.
[84:30.83]Yeah, I don't think I would want to crush you that bad, so...
[84:36.22]hook me up with laser oh boy Mr. slinn looking over his shoulder at the team being picked puts his hands up in the air saying what can I do thinking this might be a one-sided affair but it's why they play the game slinn you're the first pick you got to play yeah he's gonna come over here and say words slinn you are you are I that was very much intentional
[84:58.68]You've got a very, very positive attitude right now.
[85:01.20]You're going to bring the positivity.
[85:02.44]This is going to roll into the victory.
[85:04.60]Yeah, apparently there's a saloon.tf thing up for this matchup.
[85:08.39]And with every pick, it just goes more towards Team Star.
[85:12.71]Every pick just makes it go Team Star.
[85:15.15]Oh, man.
[85:15.75]Those have to be the most one-sided bets so far.
[85:20.98]Well, what's the medic situation here?
[85:27.22]There's only one left.
[85:29.10]It's nursing.
[85:29.76]You picked Mr. Slim.
[85:31.25]That's the better situation.
[85:32.35]No, no, no, I'm just saying for you.
[85:35.13]Okay, I'm just wondering.
[85:37.01]I was just looking at it.
[85:43.34]I'm going to get the heavy.
[85:44.58]Kresnik is now on this team.
[85:46.66]That's a big pick.
[85:47.68]That's a good pick.
[85:50.18]Area denial.
[85:51.83]That's a really good pick.
[85:54.61]I'm seeing a connection here that I need to make.
[85:59.56]And I'm going to get Goldfish.
[86:01.85]Wow.
[86:06.72]So now there's Seagull and Goldfish on opposite teams.
[86:09.24]That seems like a mismatch.
[86:10.80]Yeah.
[86:11.22]One eats the other sometimes.
[86:13.27]Like the natural predator, yeah.
[86:14.59]The Goldfish is the natural predator of the Seagull.
[86:16.73]But Sesko eats both of them.
[86:18.88]That's a good point.
[86:21.58]This is going to be an 8v8, so there are three picks left for both teams.
[86:24.69]Everybody that's left will be picked.
[86:25.67]They won't show up on screen, by the way.
[86:27.23]I like Ster's tactic of not picking the Medic, knowing that he will pick it last.
[86:33.56]He will get what he wants in this game.
[86:35.21]Well, we'll see.
[86:35.91]I believe that was part of the gentleman's rule.
[86:38.71]That is the gentleman's rule, yeah.
[86:39.83]Did we have a gentleman's agreement?
[86:40.96]A Medic, that was a gentleman's agreement?
[86:45.33]What, did we?
[86:46.85]I think you're both just gentlemen.
[86:48.15]There's a medic limo, wasn't there?
[86:50.80]I don't know.
[86:51.96]Alright, so we are sending Jorma's pick.
[86:54.74]Jorma.
[86:58.79]I could be real well-rounded here, but I need a scout.
[87:06.46]Which one of these three dapper gentlemen?
[87:16.48]faces just like you could just pick based on the face here um good look how hard power gun's going I know paragon is like on he's on like fire in there he's like he's like going full super saiyan um okay let's go with let's go with paragon alright
[87:39.95]The gentleman's agreement was to have some off-class.
[87:46.36]Fathom is one of the last ones left.
[87:49.15]So before you keep picking all the heavies, I gotta get Fathom.
[87:52.56]That's the rules.
[87:58.49]We both have two picks left, right?
[88:00.91]Not that there's off-classing in 8v8.
[88:05.25]So that leaves... I'll take Milo as the second soldier.
[88:11.58]Alright.
[88:14.99]So we're not going to be able to see that on the thing, but Milo is on the red team.
[88:18.34]Team Jerma.
[88:21.34]I... Is that going to work?
[88:25.13]Then I'm going to have four scouts.
[88:27.19]Or no, three.
[88:29.07]I'll end up with three scouts.
[88:30.28]Yeah, I should probably... I'll take another scout.
[88:33.48]That's probably a better idea.
[88:36.19]Wait, either way, I have two scouts, two soldiers.
[88:37.91]Either way, I guess it doesn't matter.
[88:39.83]Are we... yeah.
[88:42.28]I should probably just take another scout then.
[88:45.58]Because then that would be... I'd have two, and then you'd have two, right?
[88:50.62]Clockwork and says they'd have three.
[88:52.33]Yes.
[88:53.17]Okay.
[88:54.09]There's really no way to do this at this point.
[88:58.08]I'll take Aporia.
[89:00.24]Aporia is going to be on Team Jerma.
[89:02.81]And that's leaving me with Milo and Mercy.
[89:06.66]And then I will have Alpha.
[89:09.00]Alpha, who is an incredibly good player, will be the last pick.
[89:11.55]Love Alpha.
[89:12.27]Love Alpha, the Vampire TF2.
[89:13.93]This music's giving me high blood pressure.
[89:16.70]It's so suspenseful.
[89:17.88]Yeah, it really is.
[89:18.48]It's stressful.
[89:19.25]Okay, we're going to get into the 8v8.
[89:21.13]It's on Viaduct.
[89:22.05]That's a lot of people to put on Viaduct.
[89:25.45]Any other thoughts on the draft?
[89:27.14]Anyone?
[89:27.86]Team Jerma, looking good.
[89:29.22]Yeah, Solynda TF is implying that Team Star might be the favorite, but I like some of Jerma's picks.
[89:35.37]What are the odds?
[89:35.97]Do we know what the odds are in this match?
[89:38.08]Can we get an update on the odds?
[89:40.52]James is going to look it up here, Mr. McDonald.
[89:43.53]Slyn is just looking desperate over there.
[89:46.19]He looks defeated already.
[89:47.69]There's that Slyn smile, that boyish smile.
[89:50.78]He's not... My rebel's going to write it down.
[89:53.16]I went to salon.tf.
[89:54.70]Server not found.
[89:55.88]Going to write it down here.
[89:57.57]Can't do it.
[89:58.11]And check out the odds, man.
[89:59.95]Got no connection here in this laptop.
[90:02.11]I'm going to eat another apple.
[90:04.24]No idea, boys.
[90:04.92]Tell me I have connection issues.
[90:06.44]Yeah.
[90:06.84]The internet's kind of been a little spotty here.
[90:08.40]It's been down, yeah.
[90:09.82]Yeah.
[90:09.90]The internet's dying, man.
[90:12.03]Pretty good.
[90:12.61]Yeah, thanks.
[90:13.63]Can he do it, Captain?
[90:15.67]I'm not sure.
[90:16.48]I guess I'm curious, but it doesn't really matter.
[90:18.38]I would love to read some of these donations, but my thing... Oh, no.
[90:21.12]Comments are back.
[90:23.05]One more time.
[90:23.83]Over 200,000.
[90:24.67]201,000 and counting.
[90:27.29]And a raffle.
[90:28.10]Yeah, and I should say before we get started in this... It's going up and up.
[90:31.52]What is it?
[90:31.86]91%?
[90:31.98]91%.
[90:33.22]91% for Team Ster.
[90:35.53]Wow.
[90:35.83]91%.
[90:37.59]That's daunting.
[90:38.69]You could get some good odds there, Jeremiah.
[90:40.30]Why don't you go put some of your... How about we put our 2-0-2 size in there?
[90:44.04]Yeah, I don't know about those odds.
[90:46.31]Thanks for the skins.
[90:47.59]And just rig it.
[90:49.35]Yeah, I don't know.
[90:49.79]I feel bad if anyone actually loses or wins skins on this.
[90:52.10]I'm going to go ahead and bet myself that the bet's closed.
[90:55.00]Mike's logging in right now on his Steam thing.
[90:56.55]Put up some buds.
[90:57.73]I should say, before we get too silly here, we are a couple minutes away.
[91:02.24]So if you want to put any more money into the raffles, they are closing in two minutes.
[91:07.17]That is midnight Eastern, 11 p.m.
[91:10.77]Actually, it's 1159, I'm told.
[91:12.66]I want to be exact.
[91:13.32]I don't want people to donate and feel like they've missed out on something.
[91:16.73]So...
[91:17.49]We have so many good items you can bring down the list.
[91:19.65]I could not possibly list them alright now, but there's so much cool stuff that you guys can win.
[91:24.47]Valve swag, a $1,500 computer from iBUYPOWER, a ton of unusuals.
[91:29.84]This quilt right here, perhaps the most unusual item of all.
[91:33.54]Admirable you can win as well?
[91:35.10]You can't win Admirable, unfortunately.
[91:37.11]They're deporting him immediately.
[91:38.53]I live in your house as a trash disposal.
[91:40.57]All the other apple cores and everything, you know, no problem.
[91:44.33]The human goat.
[91:45.96]I have a quick question.
[91:47.60]You said 91%.
[91:49.26]How many of those percentage points is because he has clockwork on the team?
[91:53.65]Probably... Like 64?
[91:56.13]It was probably 50-50 to start with, and then when you picked Mr. Slim first, I'm guessing it was like... 88% after that.
[92:05.75]Steve... It's like you can't stop doing it.
[92:09.60]Just wait, Mr. Slin.
[92:12.00]Slin, I got faith.
[92:14.30]You guys want to make your jokes.
[92:16.36]He's going to turn this around and bada-boom.
[92:19.15]That's all I got to say.
[92:20.53]By the way, the last match was 81% to 19% in my favor as well.
[92:26.64]Okay.
[92:27.96]Did they have odds on the first match?
[92:30.76]I don't believe the first match was on the website because it's not here.
[92:34.42]Okay.
[92:35.74]I feel like Star's been kind of programmed in Jerma.
[92:38.00]He bans Mr. Slin the first two games, like inflates his price, and fools Jerma into picking him first here for the big race.
[92:44.23]I wanted Slin on my team in the first game, and he banned him.
[92:46.75]It's the ultimate metagaming.
[92:47.65]So I want to be exact when this stuff is ending.
[92:50.15]I'm not sure if we're going to start this game before the raffles end.
[92:53.38]It's really, it's in seconds.
[92:55.04]And actually, it just went to 10.59 on my tablet.
[92:58.84]I don't know how official that is.
[93:01.18]But I believe the raffle's over.
[93:02.59]Doesn't mean you shouldn't keep donating, because it is a great cause, and every little bit counts and helps, but I think they are over.
[93:10.90]Friends.
[93:11.96]Do I not have this map?
[93:13.52]I can't connect to the... You don't have Viaduct.
[93:16.00]That's interesting.
[93:16.74]Oh, it's different, okay.
[93:17.70]It's Pro-aduct RC8.
[93:20.01]Oh, oh, oh.
[93:21.03]Very, very RC.
[93:22.35]We have Pro-aduct now, Seabear.
[93:23.81]Yeah, that's nice.
[93:25.33]Can you help me with these items?
[93:28.79]Mike, please.
[93:29.99]Shot him with the... That's a thing.
[93:31.78]It's like a stuffed animal that shoots stuff out of its thing.
[93:35.59]Mm-hmm.
[93:37.48]We have, guys, raffles running in five minutes, as Seabear alluded to.
[93:41.37]Five minutes.
[93:42.79]And I'm going to start counting it down.
[93:44.27]300, 299, 298.
[93:47.34]Oh.
[93:49.64]Don't stop.
[93:50.18]Don't try to stop me.
[93:51.34]I'm not.
[93:52.47]Five minutes are left.
[93:53.71]We've got five minutes left, and that's it for the raffles.
[93:56.77]Okay.
[93:57.61]So they pushed them back a little bit, I guess.
[93:58.92]2015 tip of the hats, guys.
[94:01.21]Yeah, so if you want to get those last-minute donations in, up your chances of winning whatever awesome thing that you want to win, please get those in.
[94:07.21]Now, the donations, those never end.
[94:10.12]No.
[94:10.28]You can always donate, but if you want to win stuff as well...
[94:13.87]That's just under five minutes.
[94:15.67]And I believe that all the winners are going to be announced right after this segment's over as soon as they're able to get them.
[94:20.13]It might take a little bit of time because there's so much stuff to sort through.
[94:23.56]But I think winners should be announced on stream.
[94:25.44]You're correct.
[94:26.44]I think that's why we have all these cameras here.
[94:28.35]I hope so.
[94:29.63]Well, I mean, we need a camera to announce who wins.
[94:32.19]Tune into the after show podcast that we'll be having.
[94:35.34]Yeah.
[94:35.70]And how rigged will it be?
[94:37.34]How ringed is it?
[94:38.70]Yeah.
[94:38.98]How many will Star win?
[94:41.29]That's a really great question.
[94:42.65]Yeah.
[94:43.11]Thank you.
[94:43.59]That's why I'm here.
[94:44.51]That's why they're paying me the big bucks.
[94:46.33]They're paying you big?
[94:47.28]I hear a TF2 in my ears.
[94:48.46]I think it's harder to get 16 people into a game.
[94:51.16]I think the saloon people are ready to go.
[94:52.75]They want to see whether or not they're going to double, triple their skins.
[94:56.55]They know nothing.
[94:57.21]Last minute Jerma bets.
[94:59.82]You're getting pretty good odds there.
[95:00.84]Go ahead.
[95:01.62]I kind of want to on this laptop right now.
[95:05.72]When all your skins?
[95:08.99]I have actual confidence here.
[95:13.30]We are just taking a quick little pause.
[95:16.86]We're still here.
[95:17.64]We're still here.
[95:19.47]There's a bug that's being squashed over on the table.
[95:21.71]We're seeing donations coming in fast right now.
[95:23.39]Mike, where are we at in the countdown?
[95:24.59]Hot and heavy.
[95:25.37]What second are we at?
[95:26.49]In terms of the countdown?
[95:27.35]242, 241.
[95:28.36]I got to start over, I think.
[95:30.38]300, 299.
[95:33.80]I can only count anything over 40 is pushing it.
[95:37.35]I tend to lose my place.
[95:39.57]That's not so good.
[95:40.47]I am Canadian.
[95:41.43]Hey, we're in the game.
[95:42.43]Thank you.
[95:42.84]Alright, it's going to be a little bit weird.
[95:44.32]It looks like the HUD actually holds up okay, and I think this game has started.
[95:48.04]We see the laser pistol.
[95:50.43]Mike?
[95:50.89]It's called the Righteous Bison.
[95:52.31]That's right.
[95:52.75]I knew that one.
[95:54.68]Blaze's black box is going to heal him up with rockets, and it's actually a three on three mid after all this.
[96:00.85]Sezko actually getting a double kill, and we do see Akuma with a headshot onto Sezko, so very close first mid.
[96:08.04]It's going to be hard with all these respawning, all these players on this map.
[96:10.83]It's going to be pretty hectic.
[96:12.25]There's going to be a lot of carnage going on here.
[96:16.85]Do you have two pun intended?
[96:18.55]No.
[96:19.21]Here comes Akuma.
[96:22.54]What?
[96:22.82]What?
[96:23.40]The Quick-Fix and the shield charger combined to take both the bikes away from him.
[96:28.99]He swings, he misses.
[96:30.47]Oh, man.
[96:31.73]So the first cap is going to go to Team Star.
[96:33.53]Fock with the company.
[96:36.14]Cesco, actually, the MVP of that mid, I think, got a triple kill.
[96:40.40]Blaze jumps in far left.
[96:41.90]He's going to drop a Porya.
[96:44.66]and what does Team Jerma have to do here, Admirable?
[96:47.06]They have a lot of that utility stuff, Kuma, Spy.
[96:48.75]You're going to have to get some picks here.
[96:51.25]Yeah, they should play very recklessly right now because they are not in control of the point.
[96:57.16]They will spawn faster, so just go in and try and get trades.
[97:00.04]Take those 1v1s and just use your superior respawn wave at times there to just overwhelm your opposition.
[97:09.81]And you do see Team Star kind of backing out a little bit.
[97:12.28]Team Jerma...
[97:13.40]Not really taking advantage of that window of opportunity.
[97:16.40]They are regrouping now, but it's gonna be seven on seven here.
[97:19.04]It's about to get messy.
[97:22.07]Alpha, the last pick, just barely dodges out here.
[97:25.05]So much carnage going on.
[97:27.37]Just people falling everywhere.
[97:28.81]Seagull somewhere flocks into two kills.
[97:30.69]We didn't get to see him.
[97:31.37]One was on Clockwork, so every Clockwork kill's gonna be so big.
[97:34.44]Guy went 80 and 20, I think, on an I-55 match on this, a closer match, and he's just dominant on this map, able to jump around and scout.
[97:41.88]But there you go, Team Jerma, coming back.
[97:43.65]Uh-oh, Blaze is bugling in.
[97:46.17]He's got the mini-crit bugle.
[97:48.39]That thing is devastating, but he doesn't have his team there to take advantage of that mini-crit aura.
[97:53.24]Did Mr. Slint just drop?
[97:55.34]Did Mr. Slint drop Uber?
[97:56.98]Has he dropped before?
[97:58.89]I don't think that can happen, but we'll check.
[98:04.84]Parachute again?
[98:05.62]I didn't see it go down, but...
[98:09.15]I didn't see what you're talking about here.
[98:11.18]A Mr. Slim drop is like a Muhammad Ali getting knocked out situation.
[98:14.40]It just can't happen.
[98:15.82]I'm not making any jokes.
[98:18.31]Right.
[98:21.03]Blue's able to recap the point, but some time runoff.
[98:23.40]Team Jerma's putting up more of a fight than people expected to lead so far in this first round.
[98:26.54]Alpha gets his head chopped off by Zalox, and so does Aporia, just chopping heads off left and right there.
[98:31.63]He's going to collect them, get even buffer, run around the speed of light.
[98:34.76]He's going to get a third head on the Paragon.
[98:37.16]And now he has 500 health when buffed, I believe.
[98:39.67]And unstoppable monster that is Demoknight.
[98:44.28]Oh my god!
[98:45.86]He's going to charge right into the spun-up heavy.
[98:48.15]Not totally advisable.
[98:49.65]His health just melted there.
[98:51.80]Yeah.
[98:51.92]280 points of health just went away.
[98:53.34]Two soldiers parachuting, fighting each other.
[98:56.62]I like that a lot.
[98:57.55]And when they fall down, it looks like red team is going to have an advantage.
[99:01.07]Can they get the point?
[99:02.35]One minute left on the clock.
[99:03.54]The stopwatch timer for Team Ster.
[99:06.58]Jerma's team has two minutes and 20 seconds left.
[99:08.56]They have to cap and get a big chunk of time left.
[99:11.83]Yeah, a lot of players running these unlocks, you know, you can build up the power of over time.
[99:17.54]Like the airstrike here, the more frags you get, the more rockets you can launch from when airborne.
[99:22.55]And then we have the demo nights, the head collection.
[99:25.28]Ooh, that was a good stab.
[99:28.99]Jerma, what do you think?
[99:30.17]Your team has a mountain to climb in this first round, but they've got the point right now.
[99:33.78]Can they do it?
[99:34.84]I don't know.
[99:35.70]The two scouts, the top two on the team, seem to be getting a lot of good picks here.
[99:40.00]Let's hope they can keep it up for another two straight minutes.
[99:42.99]Siegel with that airstrike is just going crazy.
[99:45.59]It looks insane when he shoots all those rockets.
[99:47.15]He got a double kill there.
[99:48.10]Yeah, he's doing well, too.
[99:49.64]They're doing good.
[99:50.38]They're holding the fort down.
[99:51.68]Yeah, you got your heavy spun up on the stone there.
[99:53.06]I'm going to have to get out of there.
[99:55.01]I don't know.
[99:55.29]Heavy doesn't want to move.
[99:56.47]He's got a million billion health regen.
[99:59.68]He's moving forward.
[100:00.89]He's just going to hold the point off.
[100:02.11]There it is.
[100:02.77]Wow.
[100:03.33]The Quick-Fix.
[100:04.41]So good.
[100:05.05]He's still up there.
[100:06.33]He's still there.
[100:07.48]He's still got 260 health.
[100:08.66]Who cares?
[100:09.96]Can't take him down.
[100:11.18]And he's got Akuma shooting those ambassador headshots over his shoulder.
[100:14.95]And that's a big hold right there.
[100:16.27]This time is coming down to be pretty even here.
[100:19.01]I think there's a lot of nervous bettors on the saloon website.
[100:21.96]I think all the blue has bet on Jerma's team.
[100:26.42]Drones might be real, boys.
[100:27.55]They are the 9%.
[100:29.60]Blaze comes in.
[100:30.51]He's got the black box.
[100:31.29]That looks like he's cycling everyone.
[100:33.13]Look at Seagull.
[100:34.01]What is going on?
[100:34.45]What is life?
[100:35.62]He just shot 14 rockets.
[100:37.58]Look at him loading every rocket.
[100:39.44]He's picking up rocks off the ground and putting it in there.
[100:41.65]He doesn't care.
[100:44.50]Team Jerma unable to get a foothold on this point again.
[100:48.55]Seven seconds remaining.
[100:50.08]They're really throwing bodies on there.
[100:52.20]They are going to claim that cap, but if it changes hands again, it's probably going to be over for Team Jerma for this round at least.
[100:58.85]Kresnik is doing a lot of work here.
[101:02.06]Look at Seagull!
[101:04.86]Yo, Seagull has, I think, eight rockets right now loaded, and that is so much damage that if he's able to find two or three guys clumped up, he's just going to destroy them.
[101:15.71]And that Seagull, that's called the air strike.
[101:17.53]I don't care what it's called.
[101:18.71]It's awesome.
[101:19.17]He got the med pick.
[101:20.41]Oh, the air shot from Depple.
[101:22.71]He's going to finish it off.
[101:24.17]Wow, no, he did get Zalox.
[101:25.72]Jerma with those head shots.
[101:27.16]Wow.
[101:28.10]Jerma standing on his chair right now, rooting his boys on.
[101:31.86]This is the best posture I've had all week.
[101:34.62]They're going to come in here in the enemy's form.
[101:36.91]Oh, he gets spotted out, though, and will drop.
[101:40.02]But still, Seagull never died, so he still has... What's the max number of rockets you can have in the air strike, gentlemen?
[101:45.67]I believe it's eight.
[101:46.63]I believe it is eight, yes.
[101:48.40]Is that enough, do you think?
[101:49.34]It's pretty good.
[101:49.98]It's plenty, yeah.
[101:52.00]Such a compact map as well.
[101:53.71]Eight players in each team, you know, you're going to be getting lots of bonus damage there for sure.
[101:58.65]Yeah, he's going to have to come up big with it.
[102:00.09]He's still alive on the field somewhere, but seven, or actually all eight alive now, and he has three teammates down.
[102:06.42]Porya gets beasted by Sesko.
[102:08.00]Here he comes.
[102:08.56]He's going to try to get those rockets off, but no, Sesko is able to shoot him down.
[102:13.70]Counting down, it's not going to be over yet.
[102:15.45]Five seconds left for Star, but I don't think there's going to be enough presence for Red to run this back.
[102:19.97]No, that was close.
[102:21.37]Wow, so close.
[102:22.09]What a round.
[102:22.73]Two seconds.
[102:24.01]That is 90% better than what people thought.
[102:27.15]That was really, really close and really awesome.
[102:29.22]Star, are you worried now?
[102:31.82]No, I'm not.
[102:34.08]Jeremy, you think you're going to come back?
[102:36.14]Hey, they did that.
[102:37.14]Yes, I do.
[102:39.87]That was seriously, that was, you know, good job, gentlemen.
[102:45.55]First three kills go to Team Jerma.
[102:49.37]First four or five kills go to Team Jerma.
[102:51.78]Finally, Blaze is going to get one.
[102:53.80]He has the bugle.
[102:54.76]He might be able to get those mini crits, but there's no one left to heal or to give that aura to a full wipe.
[102:59.91]White seven stay up.
[103:02.22]What is going on?
[103:03.18]What do you think I got these plays?
[103:04.20]Bill Belichick is sitting right behind me.
[103:06.42]Thanks a lot, Bill.
[103:08.09]I knew it would play out in the long run.
[103:09.75]Oh, Akuma gets spotted out by the Pyro, gets set on fire, but unbelievable.
[103:14.04]Star, what would worry you?
[103:16.06]Yeah.
[103:17.52]A wipe at mid.
[103:22.67]Quick-Fix is in the hands of Slim.
[103:24.56]He popped it.
[103:25.30]He's going to give everybody a million billion health, but it doesn't happen.
[103:28.16]Here comes a Demoknight rolling in the side, but Zalox is having trouble.
[103:31.85]And look at Kresnik.
[103:32.87]Three straight kills with the heavy weapons goon staying with just the regular minigun, the Sasha.
[103:39.16]Guys, worth mentioning, the win limit on this map is actually two.
[103:42.90]It is two.
[103:44.58]Wow.
[103:44.96]Win limit two.
[103:46.13]Win limit two.
[103:47.31]So this is must win for Jerma.
[103:50.33]When this is through, we'll have an intermission, so it's do or die time.
[103:54.30]Okay, when people win as much as they win on Saloon TF, like, donate.
[104:00.35]That's what I have to say.
[104:01.56]Yeah, absolutely.
[104:02.28]That's a good point.
[104:02.94]It is a good point.
[104:04.34]Star has summoned you to do so.
[104:05.83]Still plenty of time to donate, guys.
[104:08.35]Slim's going to pop his...
[104:10.94]Quick-Fix and here are a million kills.
[104:13.40]Team Cherma playing like the best 8v8 team ever and possibly the only one left.
[104:20.17]Clockwork goes down.
[104:21.71]Slin with that clutch.
[104:23.71]He's got this look of intense concentration on his face.
[104:27.78]Seagull's down.
[104:28.72]You can't let him build up those eight rockets.
[104:31.30]You can't let him sit around and have that.
[104:33.72]They've had that momentum.
[104:36.07]Maybe you go tag somebody in, tell them they have to run the airstrike as well, make it even.
[104:42.41]GET SOME COACHING IN THERE, SUMMON BILL BELICHICK OR
[104:46.31]Some football coach do something.
[104:49.11]Puma with the best fight ever right there.
[104:50.75]One of those football coaches.
[104:53.26]Trying to think of the second most recognizable current football coach, and I can't really think of it.
[104:58.40]I'm not even sure I could.
[105:00.40]Tiger Woods?
[105:01.87]Tiger Woods, yeah.
[105:02.77]Tiger Woods get out there.
[105:03.71]You got it.
[105:04.19]I'm going to give the preliminary potential, at least this round, MVP to Kresnik.
[105:09.28]He's been amazing, yeah.
[105:10.32]He has been all over the place.
[105:12.16]He's just using the standard minigun as well.
[105:17.04]It's gold-plated, but standard.
[105:19.78]Well, the gold makes it better, and that's just sort of the science.
[105:22.98]Yeah.
[105:24.41]And, wow, look at this.
[105:25.55]Tetenster has zero seconds off the clock.
[105:28.49]Jerma about to do a full ace on the clock.
[105:31.84]Very rare.
[105:32.58]It was basically an even match last round.
[105:36.72]What would make you worried?
[105:38.99]I don't know.
[105:41.66]Well, don't worry, buddy.
[105:42.52]You're going to get a cap right now, so it's going to be just fine.
[105:46.28]Are we, though?
[105:48.56]I don't know.
[105:49.09]I don't think so.
[105:50.31]Heavy's coming in.
[105:51.31]No, no, no.
[105:51.97]There's a distraction.
[105:52.43]We've got a distraction.
[105:52.97]Yet another Quick-Fix.
[105:54.37]After that first drop, he's played Impeccable Medic, channeling his 2012 days.
[105:59.94]And look at this.
[106:01.30]Red trying to recap Star's team in shambles.
[106:04.40]Oh, look at what he says.
[106:05.50]Go catch his Slim Medic Dive.
[106:07.81]But is it going to matter at all?
[106:09.15]I mean...
[106:10.46]Seven alive.
[106:12.50]Three, two, one.
[106:14.41]That's going to be it.
[106:18.53]Wow.
[106:19.95]And here we go.
[106:21.13]The last official TF2 element of Tip of the Hats is going to go down to the golden last King of the Hill round.
[106:30.02]Can I just say, Nersi has let me down at every opportunity he has ever had.
[106:36.05]Alright.
[106:36.35]Who do we think is going to win it, boys?
[106:39.12]I'M CALLING Jerma'S TEAM.
[106:40.94]REALLY?
[106:41.30]YOU THINK Jerma'S TEAM WILL PULL IT OUT?
[106:43.60]WELL, MUCH MORE EVEN MID SO FAR.
[106:46.38]THREE DOWN FOR THE RED TEAM, MAKE IT FOUR.
[106:48.37]IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF THIS ACTION.
[106:49.43]DON'T GET MAD, GET EVEN.
[106:50.63]WOW, LOOK AT THIS DOMINATING WIN.
[106:52.25]THERE'S A CRITZ JUICE BEING CONSUMED.
[106:54.95]SIEGEL IS DOWN AS WELL, SO WE CAN'T GET THOSE MILLION BILLION AIRSTRIKE RIFLES GOING.
[106:59.96]CRITZICOLA DIDN'T ACTUALLY PAN OUT, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SCOUT STAYED ALIVE, RAN AWAY.
[107:04.52]GOLDFISH IS GOING TO WHIP HIS MEDIC IN THE FACE, MAKE HIM GO FASTER.
[107:07.89]Look at this, Team Stirrup.
[107:09.84]Everything they want, point and full control.
[107:13.42]Righteous bisoning his way.
[107:15.75]I love that weapon.
[107:16.89]I think it's the Quick-Fix, really.
[107:18.21]Like, Nersi switched.
[107:20.65]That thing is doing too much work.
[107:21.89]They couldn't build up an uber last game.
[107:24.30]That's true.
[107:25.20]Seagull flying around, you can't get it.
[107:27.18]Now, Mr. Slin did just get a crit Ubersaw kill onto Blaze, and that's going to give him bonus.
[107:32.81]He's actually going to pop his seagull.
[107:34.69]He's going to say hello.
[107:36.57]Hello, Nersi.
[107:37.09]Nersi's going to say goodbye right there.
[107:38.49]Paragon as well.
[107:40.57]SEES THE SOLDIER WITH THE PARACHUTE FLYING AROUND IS ABLE TO DROP HIM AND LOOKING AT THE CLOCK THOUGH STILL STAR RUNNING DOWN A 50 SECOND CHUNK I BELIEVE RED IS JUST ABOUT TO CAP RIGHT NOW TWO MINUTES AND EIGHT SECONDS SO IT'S A PRETTY INTENSE MATCH DIDN'T THINK THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY END UP HAVING ONE OF THESE BUT THIS IS AWESOME THERE'S A WAY OF THESE ALWAYS JUST BEING AMAZING DURING TIP OF THE HAT SO THEY JUST KIND OF WORK OUT THAT WAY
[108:03.25]Yeah, sometimes they don't, but, you know, this time, yeah.
[108:05.64]Kuma with the Dead Ringer can do his stabby stabby.
[108:08.42]Makes a lot of noise when he comes back into existence here, but he's going to have a melee fight.
[108:13.49]He's got a scout ringer there.
[108:14.97]Oh, wow.
[108:15.41]There's a pick there.
[108:16.65]He sets the pick.
[108:17.41]That's awesome.
[108:20.53]Seagull shoots 100 rockets.
[108:22.88]Look at this.
[108:23.70]Oh, no, Nursey does go down.
[108:24.92]She did surf everything, but needed to surf just a little bit more.
[108:28.64]Alpha.
[108:30.44]getting pocketed by Slinn, who might be the red MVP, Jerma.
[108:33.60]I don't know.
[108:34.17]Slinn has played amazing.
[108:35.43]He's living up to the first pick.
[108:37.23]He really has.
[108:38.13]First pick, Slinn.
[108:39.61]Unbelievable.
[108:40.09]We know why he was banned.
[108:41.34]You can write the story, man.
[108:41.96]No, it's insane.
[108:42.68]He's playing the game of his life.
[108:44.26]Banned twice by Star, only to undo him in the last match.
[108:47.24]Dripping down Mr. Slinn's...
[108:48.67]FOREHEAD RIGHT NOW.
[108:50.21]SEND THIS KID TO LAND.
[108:51.15]IT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO BLUE.
[108:53.14]WE'RE GOING TO PASS EACH OTHER AT 159.
[108:55.22]SLINN, 50% UBER.
[108:57.41]HE'S GOING TO BUILD IT UP.
[108:58.91]HE HAS REALLY PLAYED IMPECCABLE MEDIC.
[109:00.65]HE'S GOING TO GET YET ANOTHER UBER, WE HAVE TO THINK.
[109:04.11]BONKING SCOUTS GOING TO TRY TO GET IN BEHIND, BUT BLAZE SAYS NO, NO.
[109:08.23]BACKSTAB ONTO ZAYLOCK, SO DEMO IS DOWN.
[109:10.31]AKUMA PLAYING VERY WELL AS WELL, GETTING A LOT MORE DONE AS SPY THAN WE SAW WITH STABBY STABBY, BUT DEFINITELY A LOT MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO OTHER STUFF.
[109:19.95]GOLDFISH NOW HAS THE AIRSTRIKE AS WELL, SO THIS HAS GOTTEN VERY IMPORTANT.
[109:24.68]HE'S GOING TO SHOOT ROCKETS UP AT THAT RED SOLDIER.
[109:27.32]UBER DID GO IN, BUT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH DONE, AND STAR'S TEAM'S GOING TO PICK UP A LOT MORE TIME HERE, BOYS.
[109:32.57]WORRY TIME FOR Jerma.
[109:33.94]THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET OUT THERE.
[109:36.88]I'M STARTING TO FEEL THE HEAT.
[109:41.60]Hey, but like they say, if you can't take the heat, don't go in the kitchen and cook anything because you'll get burnt.
[109:48.11]It's the old saying.
[109:49.47]Scots are able to recap this.
[109:50.63]So 114 for Stars team.
[109:52.10]Jerma now counting down.
[109:53.78]And those picks are going to give them control.
[109:55.92]Akuma shooting those ambassador shots, trying to find those head shots.
[109:59.21]Alpha does go down.
[110:00.37]The black box of plays.
[110:02.01]We're staying on Akuma cam here, though.
[110:03.43]He's had some big plays here.
[110:05.13]He sees basically everybody on the blue team on that right side.
[110:08.40]Quick-Fix Medic is going to jump in.
[110:10.20]Looks like Blue wants to push.
[110:12.16]They don't want to give too much time up here, boys, but Red's with a good hold.
[110:16.01]Team Jerma, resilient.
[110:19.73]Milo getting on the airstrike game now as well.
[110:22.45]It's the best gun I've ever seen, frankly, so let's all use it all the time.
[110:26.36]It's very good.
[110:27.10]Goldfish is also using it.
[110:28.46]They have learned in the meta that this gun is actually insane.
[110:32.30]It has very little damage reduction.
[110:34.32]If you kill one person, it's a rocket launcher that shoots faster in the air.
[110:38.89]Hopefully Valve is watching for when Competitive comes out.
[110:42.28]Presnick is kiting the world right now, juking everybody, but he's on fire, we'll go down.
[110:47.44]Nersi's got the needles out, and on fire, oh my gosh, the needles is gonna kill Deadbolt.
[110:53.05]Looking at the clock right now, Jermis' team's still counting down, but they are, I believe, losing this fight.
[110:58.06]They have the, ooh, no, not the Frontier, what's the shotgun that crits in the air, friends?
[111:04.31]name Rescue Ranger thank you Ster that's why you are who you are buddy they still haven't kept it time's a ticking yeah I think wow you know it's just kills coming off clockwork's gonna run up there he's got regular Scattergun he's gonna take this seriously now will that be enough and it's gonna give the cap to steam Ster Jerma 21 seconds you gotta think one more cap might be the game for team Jerma
[111:30.70]I hope they know it's the two.
[111:32.81]I hope they're not holding anything back here.
[111:35.93]I don't know.
[111:37.43]Mr. Slinn's basically got his Uber.
[111:39.36]Seagull's coming in.
[111:41.90]Oh, he doesn't have a million rockets loaded, though.
[111:43.60]There he is.
[111:45.22]He's going to just rip Nercy in pepperonis.
[111:49.39]Seagull's having the time of his life with this gun.
[111:51.39]He's going to beg to get it unlocked.
[111:53.51]That's going to be it.
[111:54.32]That's going to be it.
[111:55.66]Team Jerva with the recap and the win.
[111:57.72]Mr. Slinn, get the camera on this boy.
[112:01.95]He's running in here.
[112:03.09]Steve.
[112:03.27]Camera's still not on him.
[112:04.09]Come back in.
[112:04.73]It's right here.
[112:07.23]Hey!
[112:08.29]That was great!
[112:10.22]GG's!
[112:10.54]I'd just like to shout out to all the StarFanboys.
[112:12.98]Thanks for the easy skins on saloon.tf.
[112:15.02]Give me your energy.
[112:15.95]Wow.
[112:16.45]Yeah.
[112:17.03]Stirr called it too, by the way.
[112:18.77]I owe $100 to the stream.
[112:20.43]Everybody on Froyotech was a 9%.
[112:23.26]Blaze and Clockwork just like, yeah, sure, we'll give you this money.
[112:26.92]Wow.
[112:27.52]What a match.
[112:28.22]What a game.
[112:29.28]That was a good finish.
[112:30.38]Stirr felt salty.
[112:33.47]How mad are you, Stirr?
[112:34.74]I'm glad that that was a good match.
[112:37.86]After the first one being a mess, second one got a little better, and that was a great finish.
[112:43.57]Yeah, good sport as always.
[112:44.81]That was a really good game.
[112:48.18]GG.
[112:48.90]I have spoken.
[112:50.86]I believe the raffles have ended.
[112:53.66]Raffles have ended.
[112:55.55]If you want stuff, well, you know.
[112:59.17]Too bad.
[113:01.70]We're at $204,272.
[113:02.76]I believe, Star, in Germany, you're going to stay around for the announcement of who's won stuff.
[113:08.01]Both of you have donated quite a bit, so you have, of course, a great chance of winning stuff.
[113:12.26]Actually, one of us has to donate $500, so I'm going to get on that.
[113:15.95]Go ahead and do that.
[113:16.95]Yeah, I have to donate $100 myself, too.
[113:18.85]We had a donation from our good buddy, TooMuchAwesome, who donated $250.
[113:22.85]That brings him to $1,250 this weekend.
[113:26.54]So shout-outs to him, TMA.
[113:28.36]Yeah, he's a true legend.
[113:29.92]And thanks to everybody who donated.
[113:31.70]Everybody.
[113:32.73]The TF2 community.
[113:33.47]I think we're going to have the sort of wrap-up where everybody comes in and says their bit of piece of, you know, wrap this whole thing up.
[113:40.67]We're going to take a break and we're going to fill this room.
[113:42.70]We're going to fill the room with nerds.
[113:43.78]The table's going to be moved out of the way here.
[113:45.80]Somehow even hotter than it is right now.
[113:48.42]Both figuratively and literally.
[113:50.53]Ster and Jerma are going to stay along as well.
[113:53.97]But yeah, we did it.
[113:55.67]200,000, 204,000 and counting.
[113:58.61]Plus 600 after we donate.
[114:00.94]Slow clap.
[114:01.80]Bud's always trying to get a clap going.
[114:03.64]It was one loud one.
[114:04.80]It's a slow clap.
[114:06.18]Alright, so we're going to throw to a break here.
[114:07.66]We're going to collect ourselves after that crazy game.
[114:10.27]We're going to figure out who's won what and we'll announce it when we come back and wrap this thing up.
[114:15.21]Thank you.
