[02:07.05]I love it how effective this fire, this fire pistol is against flesh.
[02:12.55]Yeah that's pretty sick.
[02:15.19]Alright, let's try and find this gate or something.
[02:19.53]Let me just replace this really quickly.
[02:27.40]Not enough ammo with this thing.
[02:31.68]We have to go up over here.
[02:36.71]Even though I think we just came from here, no big deal.
[02:39.95]Yeah, we definitely came from over here, but there's much-needed ammo here.
[02:48.93]Yeah, I think we collected everything we could.
[02:51.37]What's that?
[02:53.01]Rowdy machine gun.
[02:57.08]Wait, we have to go to the either-or trouble firestone.
[03:04.62]You need health.
[03:05.36]Yeah.
[03:07.98]I've needed health for at least, like, 15 minutes, but... Oh, jeez.

[03:28.37]I love how it stuns them temporarily and I can just keep doing this.
[03:33.71]Yeah.
[03:35.57]We both just sit there.
[03:37.51]Oh, there's a guy behind me.
[03:39.66]There we go.
[03:40.36]Level up.
[03:42.30]There's a guy still on the ledge.
[03:45.58]Can't do anything about it.
[03:46.26]I'll get him.
[03:52.38]Jesus Christ.
[03:54.60]John, next to you.
[03:55.04]Watch out next to you.
[03:56.04]Oh, let me get him.
[03:56.76]Let me get him.
[03:57.29]I got him.

[03:59.53]There you go.
[04:02.17]There we go.
[04:03.33]Beautiful.
[04:04.59]Thank you, sir.
[04:05.45]Beautiful.
[04:06.17]Wait, I just need to switch this gun out.
[04:08.29]I need some ammo.
[04:12.13]This is a bunch of horse manure.
[04:15.35]Oh, an incendiary SMG.
[04:17.51]Oh, shit.
[04:18.01]I don't have enough for that.
[04:20.81]Violent SMG.
[04:22.17]This thing was good before.
[04:25.07]Let me look at these points for a second.
[04:30.03]Oh great, I'm out of ammo with this thing too.
[04:31.49]What about the bone shredder?
[04:36.75]And I'm out of ammo with this.
[04:37.85]TK's wave.
[04:40.19]At least I have freaking ammo with this.
[04:45.05]I wish I just didn't have this one gun to use.
[04:48.07]Oh, I got him.
[04:56.89]Ooh.
[04:59.31]New grenade mod.
[05:00.24]Explosives rubberized.
[05:01.52]Explosives rubberized.
[05:02.84]Oh, I'm full on it.
[05:04.22]Wait.
[05:11.86]Shit.
[05:12.22]I got a guy on my right.
[05:13.55]There's a couple of guys over here, too.
[05:15.55]Careful.
[05:15.95]Careful.
[05:16.23]There's a lot of barrels here.
[05:18.23]Explosive barrels.
[05:32.88]Time to sneak up on this guy.
[05:35.98]Finally.
[05:36.94]Got ammo for this gun.
[05:38.16]I haven't been able to use this gun in, like, at least ten minutes.
[05:41.01]Help!
[05:41.17]Get the guy that's on my right!
[05:42.67]I'm about to die.
[05:43.75]Can you kill that guy?
[05:49.45]Yeah.
[05:50.43]Let me get this guy.
[05:52.41]Because, yeah, I'm dead.
[05:54.11]I am so dead.
[05:57.95]Shit.
[05:59.10]I'll try and help you up.
[06:01.73]I'm trying just to get headshots.
[06:02.97]Alright, I'm alright.
[06:04.23]My shield is charging back up again.
[06:06.87]I'm getting hit hard.
[06:07.71]Alright, I'm coming.
[06:13.87]I'm coming.
[06:16.02]Hang in there.
[06:25.64]You're weakening.
[06:27.16]He's gonna kill me.
[06:33.51]Throwing the bird.
[06:34.15]Trying to get the last hit.
[06:37.33]There you go.
[06:42.52]Oh, you need health.
[06:43.56]Holy shit.
[06:44.64]I'll be alright.
[06:45.86]How are your shields?
[06:46.60]You have zero health.
[06:48.38]No, there's health right here.
[06:50.14]I got it.
[06:52.66]Alright, um, so is this the gate switch or what?
[06:56.01]Wait, give me a sec, give me a sec.
[07:05.13]Alright.
[07:11.56]We got stuff in here.
[07:15.56]What do we have to do?
[07:16.10]We have to find the gate switch.
[07:17.91]Alright.
[07:18.61]Is it down there?
[07:19.19]I think it's over there.
[07:20.59]I could be wrong, though.
[07:21.35]Yeah, we haven't investigated this house yet, though.
[07:28.36]Anything of interest in that house?
[07:33.14]you can see over here this like this computer over here it's a big monitor I was gonna beat you to it but then I saw you running towards me so I was like I'm gonna beat him to my place where I already am at let's see what's in these chests okay so is this uh is this it or what we have to go to sledge's safe house
[08:01.73]no I mean do we die but I think I think we're like a uh... a step ahead of ourselves but this is we are in sledges house sledge I'm gonna buy stuff you did and I want to read this to see if we're we're going
[08:31.25]Alright.
[08:32.61]Well, with $707, I don't think I can buy much stuff.
[08:36.13]Sorry to break it to myself.
[08:38.16]Yeah, we went so far ahead of where we were supposed to go.
[08:46.84]That's so funny.
[08:49.06]Yeah, we're like two quests ahead of ourselves right now, I think.
[08:52.35]Oh, you're glitching out, dude.
[08:53.79]Am I?
[08:53.93]Your voice.
[08:54.83]Your voice is glitching out.
[08:56.91]How about now?
[08:59.11]A little bit better, yeah.
[09:01.88]I was going to say, I think we're lucky at least.
[09:05.16]Oh no, you're glitching out with your call.
[09:06.69]Here, call me back.
[09:07.65]Okay.
[09:08.01]Which one do I have equipped here?
[09:17.87]Standard unyielding shield.
[09:20.53]Oh god.
[09:21.67]Really?
[09:21.99]Ayayay.
[09:28.85]That's the one I need.
[09:29.55]I'm going to trade this one away.
[09:36.18]There we go.
[09:36.88]You back?
[09:37.50]Better?
[09:37.92]Better?
[09:38.56]Yeah, there we go.
[09:39.12]Alright.
[09:39.74]Alright.
[09:41.46]Let me see, I just need to sell my shield over here.
[09:47.27]How much money did I get for that, even?
[09:56.20]Speaking of money, I need to... I need to heal up.
[09:58.88]Get some health.
[10:05.80]Oh yeah, so do I. What was I doing?
[10:10.18]Yeah, I'm getting the minor healing kit.
[10:17.21]And then I'm gonna use it.
[10:20.49]Because it regenerates it over time, so... Do I have any skill points I can use?
[10:27.55]No, I don't have any skill points.
[10:34.50]God, this phoenix.
[10:35.76]Killing an enemy causes you to deal fire damage to nearby enemies and makes your shots not always cost ammo for a few seconds.
[10:44.43]That's awesome.
[10:47.13]I can use melee attacks while phasewalking.
[10:52.85]That's boss.
[10:54.01]You ready?
[10:54.89]Hold on, I gotta buy that shield.
[10:57.86]Here, I think we beat this guy and then we'll stop there.
[11:01.06]Alright, cool.
[11:04.54]Get this fire shield.
[11:06.38]There we go.
[11:06.88]Now I'm gonna be able to take damage like nobody's business.
[11:10.08]Alright, where are these guys?
[11:14.53]Oh shit, we're already getting fired at.
[11:16.77]Go down.
[11:17.23]Are you ready?
[11:23.55]I'm going ready.
[11:25.55]Oh, Jesus.
[11:27.69]Come here.
[11:28.51]Hello, brute.
[11:34.87]Oh, you're dead.
[11:35.57]Careful.
[11:36.67]These guys, oh man, these guys.
[11:38.41]I think these guys are behind us.
[11:43.04]50, a little bit.
[11:45.40]I'm headshotting this guy over and over again.
[11:47.80]It's not doing anything.
[11:49.42]Same.
[11:51.26]Oh, man.
[11:51.84]Maybe I can kill it.
[11:53.61]Oh, I'm dead.
[11:54.67]Oh, I am dead.
[11:56.65]So dead.
[12:09.79]Wait, let me let me get the let me get the final kill Come on give me the kill.
[12:13.09]Give me the kill.
[12:14.39]Give me the kill.
[12:14.99]Damn it.
[12:15.29]Come on.
[12:15.62]Yeah I'm gonna use my medic kit
[12:35.24]We need to finish that quest.
[12:37.36]That one that we were doing before.
[12:40.54]Oh, beasted.
[12:41.80]We're in like a... I'm really good at this.
[12:46.66]Oh shit, I'm so out of ammo in this gun.
[12:48.44]Wait, I need to switch this gun around.
[12:55.14]According to the quest log, this thing says that we should have... It's like after we did that jump, when we jumped with the car...
[13:04.73]It was barely right there.
[13:09.79]So we went like five miles in the wrong direction.
[13:14.13]And now that we finished this area, now that we left this world, we left the arid hills, all those guys are going to be back there again.
[13:22.83]Well, I guess if it's any consolation, we leveled up a lot.
[13:27.93]Yeah, and we'll have more chance to level up on guys that we can now take.
[13:31.39]Yeah, we'll be able to smoke those guys easily now.
[13:34.19]Yeah.
[13:34.41]Alright, well, I think we'll end here.
[13:36.85]Cool.
[13:38.37]That was fun.
[13:38.99]I hope these guys enjoyed it so far.
[13:41.84]We did, like, three hours of this.
[13:43.52]Four.
[13:44.08]Two.
[13:44.32]Three.
[13:44.52]I don't know.
[13:45.40]I'm sure people will take me there.
[13:46.82]Obviously, if people are fans of the game, I think they'll love it.
[13:50.09]Yeah.
[13:51.09]Awesome.
[13:52.21]Alrighty, well, we'll all see you guys next time.
[13:56.11]Look at him.
[13:56.85]Look at him.
[13:57.43]His face.
[13:58.44]His face is right here.
[14:00.56]Alright, see you guys.
[14:01.56]Take care, guys.
