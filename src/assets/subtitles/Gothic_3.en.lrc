[01:32.42]Gothic 3 is the worst game ever made?
[01:35.00]Gothic 3 is actually terrible.
[01:40.97]It's got graphics!
[01:49.73]Look at this, this looks good!
[02:03.13]This is very, very loud.
[02:12.26]Pretty good opening cutscene.
[02:13.14]Remember the orcs from that first game.
[02:23.42]It's got a good selling point.
[02:27.80]It has graphic.
[02:29.76]That is true.
[02:36.16]Can somebody go take the super mod powers?
[02:38.95]Change the game to Gothic 3.
[02:39.91]Look at that guy's head.
[02:47.51]Look at how tiny that guy's head is.
[02:48.79]Guy in the middle.
[02:50.15]His head is fucking tiny.
[02:52.43]He looks like a WWE character that I made.
[03:00.07]Go get the community mod.
[03:08.29]No one's even saying any words.
[03:19.84]Why do they all have biker beards?
[03:29.20]I love these orc beards.
[03:31.06]You guys don't like this game?
[03:32.20]This game is fucking fantastic.
[03:42.09]I judge how much I like a game based on, like, if there's somebody with a funny beard.
[04:00.94]Dead.
[04:01.58]He's not gonna make it.
[04:02.36]Pub Battlegrounds.
[04:03.22]You're not gonna make it.
[04:03.82]You're gonna be outside that.
[04:04.50]You're gonna be inside that circle.
[04:08.20]Ah, they didn't make it inside the circle in time.
[04:10.04]They didn't make it.
[04:17.93]Not one piece of dialog besides the word, yeah, by the way.
[04:24.01]There's the fucking guy with the tiny head.
[04:26.29]So they took over the city.
[04:31.12]There's the ruling orc power over there.
[04:32.82]If I walk up, I gotta walk up and get, like, judged, right?
[04:41.60]Beautiful, right into the gameplay.
[04:44.12]There's a quick slot bar at the lower edge of the screen.
[04:46.14]By pressing the corresponding number key, you can use an item.
[04:49.80]Wait.
[04:52.16]Well done.
[04:52.56]Why are you... There's a battle going on right now.
[04:55.74]Why are you doing this?
[04:58.09]Move up close until his name appears above him.
[05:00.31]You can then deal out blows by clicking the left and right mouse buttons.
[05:05.21]Holding down right mouse buttons.
[05:06.47]This is a bad place for a tutorial, man.
[05:10.57]Okay.
[05:12.69]Hey, that's so unf- What a way to fucking put me into the game and just die.
[05:23.26]Dude, the guy with the wooden staff is doing better than me.
[05:25.24]Alright, pull the sword.
[05:28.51]How do I turn my character?
[05:33.29]I can't turn my character.
[05:34.61]I just took out a torch and the game like fucking froze.
[05:44.59]I'm so useless.
[05:54.84]I'm just like sleeping.
[05:57.46]Get up, come on.
[05:59.85]How do I turn the camera?
[06:02.33]There is no, there's no turn camera, I guess.
[06:06.87]I would love to.
[06:10.09]Oh my goodness.
[06:11.19]I don't know what to do, I'm so scared.
[06:15.04]What happened to my weapon?
[06:22.09]They're just moving all the way back here, huh?
[06:26.29]Alright, I don't know what happened there.
[06:33.16]Where's my weapon?
[06:35.46]One is my sword, right?
[06:40.54]Hold the left mouse button in order to draw the bow.
[06:44.28]What?
[06:47.36]I'm drawing the bow.
[06:49.60]No, I'm not.
[06:50.22]I can't even draw the bow.
[06:53.30]I think when I died, the game fucked up and I can't do anything now.
[07:01.92]Oh, my God.
[07:04.73]Because, yeah, I need to re... We need to re... Wait.
[07:07.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:07.95]Q and E turn the character, guys.
[07:10.45]Figured it out.
[07:11.71]We're going to load a new game.
[07:20.05]Actually worse than Gothic 1.
[07:26.63]Off to Gothic 4.
[07:28.08]No, not yet.
[07:30.84]Q and E turn the character.
[07:32.50]Not the mouse.
[07:37.06]New game.
[07:38.40]Skip the cutscene.
[07:39.88]Here we go.
[07:41.02]Draw the sword.
[07:42.66]Yes, yeah.
[07:43.74]I understand.
[07:46.00]There he is.
[07:47.18]Left mouse button.
[07:57.01]And I put the sword away.
[07:58.38]I can't swing the sword.
[08:05.38]I'm just showing him the sword.
[08:08.48]Oh my god.
[08:12.53]Hold on.
[08:12.93]I need the community patch.
[08:13.95]The mouse is not going to work without the community patch.
[08:22.25]Uh...
[08:26.90]It's the Steam overlay doing this.
[08:29.90]This game has such potential, though.
[08:31.36]Like, I have to play it.
[08:32.18]You can tell that's the leader.
[08:35.84]I wasn't here for Gothic 1.
[08:42.23]Go back to Gothic 1.
[08:43.27]Wait, wait a minute.
[08:51.63]Hold on.
[08:53.50]Just bear with me for a second.
[08:57.50]We need to go get the mouse.
[08:58.64]We need to go get the make the mouse work patch.
[09:01.68]I didn't know I needed.
[09:03.08]Until right now.
[09:06.01]Alright, so you're telling me to get the Gothic 3.
[09:10.13]I have a second Gothic 3.
[09:14.41]I have the Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition.
[09:19.32]What am I thinking?
[09:20.26]Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition.
[09:26.54]I'm just going to open this one.
[09:27.89]Do I need a patch for this one?
[09:31.69]We're going to play the enhanced edition.
[09:38.19]There's probably more graphics.
[09:40.26]Let's open it up.
[09:41.80]Let's try this one first.
[09:46.80]Yeah, sure thing, Windows.
[09:51.94]Get the community.
[09:52.53]This is trying to fix a broken game.
[09:56.89]It's going to even be worse somehow.
[10:00.28]So the Enhanced Edition is just... Oh, the Enhanced Edition is a standalone DLC.
[10:06.74]Well, God, it's opening right now.
[10:08.88]There might be more graphics in this one, though.
[10:10.86]That's good.
[10:13.86]Holy fuck.
[10:14.64]I don't know if you just heard that explosion.
[10:20.42]But there was an explosion in my ear.
[10:24.03]This is like the DLC for that last game.
[10:27.40]So, okay.
[10:27.90]Let me go get the patch.
[10:29.18]Give me one second, guys.
[10:30.97]I'll be right back.
[10:31.91]Sorry again.
[11:07.83]All these websites are like .de.
[11:11.23]How come all the... These are like sketchy websites, aren't they?
[11:16.22]1.75.
[11:16.38]Is it 1.75 the one that I want?
[11:20.96]I can't believe I have to get a patch for my mouse to work.
[11:32.59]I guess I'm going to download this one.
[11:33.61]Hopefully I don't get a fucking virus.
[11:38.39]Gothic 3 EN 1.75.
[11:48.64]This is the change log.
[11:52.64]There it is.
[11:53.10]Okay.
[11:56.73]Downloading it now.
[11:58.05]It's going to take like, you know, it's going to take just enough time.
[12:04.22]It's gonna take just enough time for us to turn on the webcam and just hang out.
[12:11.83]Yeah, we got like 10 minutes.
[12:14.43]Let's just fucking turn on the IRL for a minute, you know what I'm saying?
[12:19.18]Here's my camera.

[13:15.19]Why would that be a thing?
[13:16.41]Like what do you mean no naked pictures?
[13:17.89]There we go.
[13:24.60]I look like I'm getting like my face pissed in.
[13:26.90]That's great.
[13:29.74]No, I didn't go to UNH.
[13:31.82]I just own the shirt because I like the shirt.
[13:37.12]47 minutes.
[13:42.64]Cat meals.
[13:45.50]These are not, these are cheese.
[13:47.38]I just haven't cleaned up yet.
[13:50.26]Cat meals behind you.
[13:57.30]Yeah, here are my cat meals.
[14:00.01]Why is it going up to an hour?
[14:01.45]I gotta get a different one.
[14:04.60]What the flying fuck?
[14:06.50]I just wanted to play Gothic 3 on stream.
[14:09.42]Is that like so hard to ask?
[14:15.02]Apparently it is.
[14:20.18]Where did this go?
[14:21.44]Get over here.
[14:27.56]What did I say?
[14:28.08]What?
[14:28.36]What's back here?
[14:31.67]There's a guy right there.
[14:34.97]That's a guy right there.
[14:36.71]That's a guy in a fucking costume.
[14:38.53]See his head?
[14:39.69]There's the head.
[14:41.05]There's his arms and stomach.
[14:42.77]There's his shoulder and there's his leg.
[14:44.07]Someone's going to come out of there in five minutes.
[14:45.71]That's the joke of the whole stream.
[14:47.69]They're going to come up and grab me from behind.
[14:49.31]It's going to be fucking hilarious.
[14:56.63]I can't believe this is going to take an hour.
[15:02.08]I need to find a different site.
[15:03.26]Then this site was like a legit site.
[15:05.18]Now I have to go to like a non-legit site to download this patch because it's gonna take a fucking hour.
[15:09.87]So we're gonna cancel this one.
[15:12.37]I'm gonna go back and we're gonna... 1.75.
[15:15.47]This one is... This website is called Patches Scrolls.
[15:20.25]I don't like these websites that I'm clicking on.
[15:22.63]This website looks like it was made in like 1991.
[15:25.76]Before the internet even existed.
[15:32.89]1.75.14 I gotta scan this for a virus before I do anything, man.
[15:44.39]I ain't opening this shit unless I fucking scan it first.
[15:50.81]We're gonna watch my computer burn on screen.
[15:55.53]This one's gonna take an hour.
[15:57.51]What's with all these patch websites?
[15:59.24]It's gonna take an hour to download.
[16:00.34]Two hours!
[16:03.25]Nope, we ain't doing that one.
[16:06.82]Cancel that one, please.
[16:11.80]What about like... Oh my god, what a fucking disaster.
[16:17.58]Um... World of Players.
[16:23.78]We're gonna go to World of Players.
[16:30.20]This is like a torrent.
[16:32.34]Of course I gothic three.
[16:37.98]Jesus.
[16:38.50]Okay, here's a bunch of mirrors.
[16:45.11]I don't even know.
[16:45.71]I'm scared to click this, but this one's World of Gothic.
[16:51.11]Okay, this place is called E-Prison.
[16:54.83]E-Prison.
[16:56.37]I don't want to click on E-Prison.
[16:58.07]That's a bad name for a website.
[17:00.20]I ain't going to E-Prison.
[17:03.78]I'll go here.
[17:04.32]I'm going to go to Atomic Gamer.
[17:12.97]This site can't be reached.
[17:15.61]Do any of these work?
[17:17.55]Or do we have to go to Gothic 4?
[17:26.53]I think I got one.
[17:28.17]Okay, good.
[17:29.11]We're good.
[17:29.91]I got the patch.
[17:30.75]It's downloading right now.
[17:32.98]Not going to E-prison.
[17:35.04]Not today.
[17:35.32]What the fuck was that?
[17:43.18]What the fuck was that?
[17:43.88]My computer just made a really weird thing.
[17:46.16]What just happened?
[17:47.16]What was that?
[17:47.72]Like, what was that?
[17:48.40]Really?
[17:51.18]I am fucking... We're on the way to E-prison.
[17:53.48]We're gonna get E-handcuffs.
[17:58.41]I actually am, like, kind of scared right now.
[18:00.90]This is like an exe file.
[18:02.48]You gotta- many of you guys had me download here.
[18:05.54]Yeah, just go get this fucking exe file from e-prison.
[18:08.66]Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
[18:10.64]It's to play this old shitty fucking RPG, Gothic 3.
[18:19.79]Thank you for sticking around though.
[18:21.35]We're not done.
[18:23.89]I'm at least playing through the first like two hours of this game.
[18:26.35]No, we're not done.
[18:29.27]Get e-rested.
[18:31.53]Get an E arrested from the E fucking police.
[18:34.06]The E police.
[18:40.40]That patch got canceled.
[18:47.85]Somebody came to my computer and canceled that patch.
[18:51.77]No, no, okay.
[18:52.43]There it is.
[18:53.57]So I opened this.
[18:54.93]I opened this shit.
[18:57.19]In...
[18:58.81]I like put this, do I just open the EXE?
[19:00.91]Do I have to like put this EXE in my Steam folder?
[19:03.81]Because it gets weird like if I don't want to fuck this up because I want to get right back into playing my favorite RPG of all time.
[19:11.15]The blanket moved.
[19:13.35]I told you there's a fucking guy in there.
[19:14.65]He's coming out to get us.
[19:17.27]Just open the EXE.
[19:18.43]I don't have to do anything else.
[19:20.18]After I scan it for fucking every virus that's ever existed, sure, I'll do that.
[19:26.58]I have no idea what you downloaded.
[19:27.85]I downloaded Gothic 3 EE patch.
[19:30.67]What's it called?
[19:33.49]Show in folder.
[19:35.67]Unconfirmed.
[19:37.09]CDR.
[19:37.91]No, that's not it.
[19:38.93]It'll be there in a second.
[19:39.65]You'll see.
[19:42.55]Freaky stuff is happening.
[19:43.49]No, freaky stuff's not happening behind me.
[19:45.05]We're fine.
[19:48.73]Just open lostboy.exe.
[19:50.83]I'm like lost.
[19:57.00]It's worth the effort.
[19:57.78]Gothic 3 has cool beards.
[19:59.00]And bits aren't even showing up on fucking screen.
[20:02.04]Let's bring them over here.
[20:04.45]Hey, Amph.
[20:07.27]Amphotur.
[20:08.75]Hey, thank you for the 15 bucks.
[20:11.89]Hey, Jeremy, I recently took a better job and enjoy your entertainment while I make up for some work at home.
[20:17.66]Thanks for being a real streamer and not selling out.
[20:20.14]You're not going to see that from me.
[20:21.98]Not going to see that from me.
[20:24.02]In fact...
[20:26.78]He ain't ever going to see that from me.
[20:39.85]That's refreshment.
[20:43.13]Where are we at?
[20:43.53]Two minutes?
[20:45.03]35 seconds.
[20:47.11]35 seconds remaining until we can break my computer and get a virus into it and I'll have to return my computer to Walmart where I bought it.
[20:56.64]I really hope the customer service desk at Walmart is like ready to hear my complaint about how like that my computer fucked up.
[21:07.91]Ready to go.
[21:08.93]Okay, we're ready.
[21:10.05]So double just open the patch.
[21:12.21]No, don't open the patch yet.
[21:13.39]Show in the folder.
[21:14.83]It's Gothic 3 EE patch 1.74.14 underscore int underscore full.
[21:21.51]Is that correct?
[21:23.49]Is this correct?
[21:26.50]Make a restore point before I do anything.
[21:34.43]Do I have the right one?
[21:43.37]I love how someone just wrote, no idea.
[21:46.60]I love it.
[21:48.56]So I'm going to scan this for fucking viruses with our virus scanner.
[21:53.86]Scanning for viruses.
[21:57.31]50... 45 files scanned.
[21:58.77]50 files scanned.
[22:00.73]And we're halfway there.
[22:03.41]It's taking a long time.
[22:04.31]I don't know if I'm okay with this.
[22:05.33]This is like... They might be like... They might be like evading.
[22:07.61]There might be some like fucking virus evasion here.
[22:14.20]Norton.
[22:14.64]Why the fuck does anybody... Norton comes for free on Walmart computers.
[22:17.82]You don't think I caught that?
[22:20.50]Of course I know that all Walmart computers and Best Buy computers come installed with Norton antivirus.
[22:26.70]Like 2013.
[22:27.06]And that's not what I have.
[22:33.34]What do you guys think I have?
[22:35.18]Hmm?
[22:35.80]What do you think I have for a virus scanner?
[22:38.99]There are not... There are... There are 2,600 files in here.
[22:46.47]No threats.
[22:48.95]Here we go.
[22:51.95]Just double clicked it.
[22:53.49]I just opened up a fucking Pandora's box.
[22:56.99]What is it doing?
[22:57.51]What's happening?
[23:02.06]I'm just getting the wheel of death right here.
[23:03.14]This is actually... This is freaking me out.
[23:10.06]What's going on?
[23:12.60]What is going on here?
[23:20.89]It didn't do anything.
[23:23.75]It didn't do anything.
[23:24.41]I didn't get... Whoa!
[23:31.28]I just got jumpscared by a patch.
[23:36.34]Fellas.
[23:41.83]Okay, it's in Steam.
[23:42.87]Steam app's common.
[23:43.75]There it is.
[23:46.29]Install.
[23:53.45]That was way too dramatic.
[23:54.65]Too dramatic for me.
[23:59.79]Here we go.
[24:01.69]It only took us 2 hours and 20 minutes to get to a game that I could play.
[24:04.87]No, the Gothic one was fun and funny for like an hour.
[24:09.04]That's a game that you play with your kids.
[24:10.42]You know what I mean?
[24:10.94]Like, when I'm like 100.
[24:11.76]And I will make it to 100.
[24:15.80]That's the guy.
[24:16.16]I'm gonna like load that up with my kids.
[24:18.56]Like their kids and be like, this is the old games we used to play when I was a fucking teenager.
[24:23.72]And then they'll be like, wow, that's so nostalgic.
[24:26.77]And then they'll remake Gothic 3 like fucking four times.
[24:30.09]Gothic 3 will have like four versions.
[24:31.87]There'll be like the HD version, there'll be the 4K version.
[24:34.41]And then like in a hundred years, there'll be like the fucking SK version, like super core.
[24:38.53]Like in the core is spelled with a K. If you're curious.
[24:46.11]Okay, it's installed.
[24:47.63]It's finished installing the enhanced edition patch on my computer.
[24:51.75]Okay.
[24:54.57]There it is.
[24:58.33]When am I gonna release Skyrim again?
[25:00.09]Yeah, that's a good question.
[25:04.30]How have I gained viewers?
[25:05.30]I haven't done a fucking thing in like 40 minutes.
[25:12.66]How did I gain like 400 viewers?
[25:17.35]Why?
[25:17.67]This is like the worst part of the stream.
[25:21.27]Is this better than when I was like, fucking, well, I guess it is better.
[25:26.28]That is better.
[25:26.98]You're right.
[25:30.44]Hey, well, ta-ta for now.
[25:32.98]We got a fucking video game to play, boys.
[25:35.88]And girls.
[25:40.13]Well, this.
[25:41.93]This is the best part.
[25:44.49]Now we're gonna lose people.
[25:45.56]I'm fucking laughing about it.
[25:53.78]Alright.
[25:54.26]Will this work?
[25:56.26]I have faith that it will.
[25:57.88]Let's open it up.
[26:01.84]Be careful for your ears.
[26:02.90]It might be very loud.
[26:06.09]It might be very loud and it might hurt your ears.
[26:09.43]It might stink a little.
[26:10.39]It might, like, stink.
[26:12.21]Does it stink?
[26:13.85]Oh, yeah.
[26:19.07]Does the game open?
[26:20.36]That's like what I care about.
[26:21.30]Okay, the game opens.
[26:27.02]It has like a weird... Okay, it worked.
[26:29.18]You guys are going to have to tell me what the fuck any of this means.
[26:33.74]Because I don't know what it means.
[26:39.64]Like what the fuck does this shit mean?
[26:41.12]Close that.
[26:45.56]Get that over here.
[26:46.33]Over there.
[26:46.57]Okay.
[26:46.69]Okay.
[26:48.63]We're in business.
[26:49.97]Just need to turn the fucking audio on.
[26:52.05]In business.
[26:55.92]Can you see?
[26:57.16]Yes!
[26:57.60]Okay.
[26:58.68]Uh, what does alternative balancing mean?
[27:03.86]Nudity incoming.
[27:05.14]I just downloaded a nudity patch.
[27:10.01]Alternative balancing?
[27:11.15]Is it gonna keep it on?
[27:16.99]Any new options?
[27:19.69]Very high.
[27:22.55]Video.
[27:23.35]So, 120 hertz!
[27:25.39]Woo!
[27:27.11]Audio.
[27:27.89]Uh, yeah, let's, let's... Okay.
[27:34.12]Yeah.
[27:35.10]Yeah.
[27:35.86]Subtitles on.
[27:36.62]Speaker set up.
[27:37.10]We got it English and stereo.
[27:40.20]Now, let's play a new game.
[27:41.92]Pretend like you didn't see it.
[27:44.41]Really want to start a new game with alternative balancing.
[27:46.65]Sure.
[27:48.69]Sure.
[27:50.82]That's just one of my emotes.
[27:55.56]That was a fucking jermaMoon emote.
[27:57.94]That was a planet.
[28:05.12]Just laughing about it a little bit.
[28:07.30]Kind of.
[28:07.68]Slightly.
[28:08.06]Not really.
[28:10.00]We already saw this.
[28:11.44]Alright.
[28:12.56]Here we go.
[28:12.94]Draw your weapon.
[28:14.64]Enhanced edition.
[28:16.14]Left click to attack an opponent.
[28:19.23]It works.
[28:25.38]Now we're having fun.
[28:29.26]Now we're having some fucking fun.
[28:30.60]Is this a baseball swing, people?
[28:40.61]That's the thing, you gotta hold it down to do a super swing.
[28:50.38]You guys don't like this game?
[28:51.72]How fucking dare you?
[28:52.98]Alright, hold down the left mouse button in order to draw the bow.
[28:57.68]The white aiming guide in the middle of the screen shows where your arrow will land.
[29:01.34]As soon as you release the left mouse button, the arrow is shot.
[29:03.36]The longer you hold the mouse button, the farther the arrow will fly.
[29:06.52]Easy, get out of the way!
[29:23.21]Get up.
[29:23.67]Come on.
[29:25.75]I'm gonna hit this guy right in the head.
[29:29.99]Ready?
[29:30.22]Here we go.
[29:36.02]Come on.
[29:36.54]Get him in the head.
[29:37.08]I'm just filling this guy with arrows.
[29:45.00]He's dead.
[29:45.30]Okay, what about the scout right there?
[29:48.29]Got him.
[29:55.67]Alright, can we get out of this?
[29:57.66]I'm getting flashbacks.
[30:02.56]It takes that long to drink a potion?
[30:08.12]Wow, that's fucking unbelievable.
[30:09.60]Alright, I gotta lure them over here.
[30:15.48]This 2v1 thing ain't fair though.
[30:20.80]That's a parry.
[30:24.02]Okay, this game has at least better action than the first one.
[30:28.50]It's like drinking an Estus Flask.
[30:36.09]Alright, drinking Estus.
[30:45.27]Alright, my sword is gone.
[30:49.93]My sword's on the ground.
[30:56.43]Come on.
[30:58.89]Can I pick up that axe?
[31:04.42]What's the goal here, by the way?
[31:07.38]What's the goal?
[31:09.48]Do we have a goal?
[31:15.27]We're getting overrun.
[31:16.41]Holy shit.
[31:17.91]That's really a Dark Souls character.
[31:21.29]That's exactly what a guy that you would summon looks like in...
[31:28.50]I can't do a new game.
[31:29.32]We're supposed to survive.
[31:34.64]That's what I have to do.
[31:35.38]I can't even get the fuck up.
[31:47.19]Let me up.
[31:47.73]Please let me play.
[31:49.99]I just want to play.
[31:51.79]The guy that I summoned is doing a lot of good things.
[31:56.50]Why won't it just kill me so I can fucking reload?
[32:01.09]And now I drop my bow.
[32:04.01]There's nothing else I can do.
[32:04.93]Give me the bow.
[32:08.83]How do I jump?
[32:19.94]Can you die in these games?
[32:22.40]No, wait, just wait.
[32:24.82]Okay, we're good.
[32:25.42]What's that?
[32:25.98]Nope.
[32:27.24]Go.
[32:28.76]Pick up the stool.
[32:36.81]Sword.
[32:47.86]Where did the sword go?
[32:50.46]Get away from me.
[32:53.73]I gotta... Just back it up.
[32:55.33]Back it up.
[32:58.31]We're almost done with the first bit of the tutorial.
[33:03.39]Got it!
[33:04.61]That's such a lucky Estus.
[33:10.52]What are you doing?
[33:11.30]Take it all.
[33:11.78]Yeah, sure.
[33:21.34]I can't believe this is still going.
[33:23.72]I can't believe this wasn't just part of a cutscene.
[33:26.09]Nobody's losing.
[33:39.95]Nobody's winning or nobody's fucking losing.
[33:44.67]No, it's tough drinking.
[33:46.39]It's tough drinking.
[33:47.23]And pick up the sword and get... Just do a fucking exercise in front of him.
[33:57.12]Got it!
[33:57.38]Better than the sword.
[34:04.90]Watch out.
[34:05.44]Drink.
[34:10.69]Drink it.
[34:11.13]Drink it!
[34:19.15]Just killed him?
[34:20.01]Ah, easier said than done.
[34:25.23]No, I wish I could just pick up this shit, man.
[34:28.04]Give me the sword.
[34:31.62]Get the sword.
[34:32.12]This worked last time.
[34:40.95]Might as well make it work again.
[34:49.40]Got it.
[34:49.62]Okay.
[34:50.22]Give me that.
[34:53.24]The orcs have been defeated.
[34:54.30]You can now put your weapon away by pressing the space bar.
[34:58.71]What do you mean?
[35:01.27]Defeated?
[35:01.73]They haven't been defeated.
[35:06.21]They're running away.
[35:16.32]Get over here.
[35:17.28]Oh, shit.
[35:17.60]Now there's a bird following us.
[35:22.34]Fine, let him run.
[35:23.06]God damn it.
[35:29.40]Why am I not running?
[35:30.30]Alright, I got experience.
[35:32.78]Okay.
[35:38.47]So.
[35:40.93]That was interesting.
[35:43.23]This music needs to sincerely stop.
[35:50.61]Take all...
[35:56.37]Okay.
[35:58.84]The music is just restarting again.
[36:04.16]Oh, it's Diego!
[36:07.74]Remember Diego from the first game?
[36:15.15]How do we talk?
[36:20.09]You jump real high in this game.
[36:26.00]Give me this.
[36:26.38]I missed the tutorial because I was getting fucking chased.
[36:31.95]Who do I need to talk to?
[36:32.85]Healing potions.
[36:35.63]Reduck.
[36:45.69]Why, what's there?
[36:46.23]He said the name wrong.
[36:47.77]Am I the same character?
[36:48.49]Okay.
[36:48.71]Gordy.
[37:05.85]Now what should I tell these rebels when I find them?
[37:07.90]Tell their leaders to send us fighters.
[37:10.70]We don't stand a chance by ourselves.
[37:13.36]Now we're all so in it up to our necks.
[37:17.34]The Dark Souls character is dead over here.
[37:20.76]Wait, there's like three Dark Souls characters.
[37:25.35]Alright, so give me like all this shit.
[37:29.99]Is this free shit?
[37:30.37]That's just gonna cause more trouble.
[37:35.75]I think this is free shit.
[37:37.51]Well, it is now.
[37:40.34]Alright.
[37:41.18]Long, rusty two-hander.
[37:44.14]How do I get to my inventory?
[37:45.22]Like, where's the inventory?
[37:53.19]I?
[37:54.13]All items that you pick up appear in your inventory.
[37:56.13]There are different item categories that you can select in the upper right corner.
[37:58.95]Left-click on items to use or equip them.
[38:02.45]Okay.
[38:05.61]I don't have enough strength, so I'm just going to throw them away.
[38:17.79]I can't use these.
[38:21.73]Spells.
[38:23.83]Fireball.
[38:24.51]Good old Fireball.
[38:25.43]Let's put that down there.
[38:26.75]Light.
[38:28.73]We're going to be a Magician.
[38:30.93]Teleporter's Stone and Heal Other.
[38:36.49]All attributes and talents of the hero are shown here.
[38:38.53]Whenever the hero goes up a level, he will receive learning points that can be used with trainers.
[38:42.90]Any talents already mastered are shown in color.
[38:44.62]For more information about the various talents, move your mouse over a talent.
[38:47.28]Okay, holy shit.
[38:49.18]Alchemy skills, magic skills.
[38:54.32]Um, this is a lot.
[38:56.13]Okay.
[38:57.81]I need 50 ancient knowledge.
[39:02.01]Which I don't have.
[39:02.71]Okay, that's fine.
[39:05.52]As soon as the heroes learn a spell, the corresponding icon will appear in the color book.
[39:10.18]It'll appear in the coloring book.
[39:16.31]Yeah, quick slot.
[39:20.81]Okay, magic with dominance.
[39:24.41]Summoning magic.
[39:26.22]Transfer disease.
[39:28.24]Poison.
[39:29.24]Amnesia.
[39:30.44]The target forgets all the hero's crimes.
[39:32.30]This could be fun.
[39:33.96]Summon demon.
[39:38.64]I can make animals attack.
[39:41.00]I can transform into an animal.
[39:45.30]Holy shit.
[39:47.90]Banish evil.
[39:48.78]Okay, this could be really, really interesting stuff.
[39:51.39]Smithing blueprints.
[39:53.77]Gotta find an anvil.
[39:54.63]Okay, well there's no anvil here.
[39:58.91]I don't have any shit.
[40:01.57]Okay, all missions.
[40:02.37]This menu shows the hero's missions and the reputation he has gained through successful missions with the various factions.
[40:10.01]Okay, this is just like a map of Disney.
[40:12.76]Here's like Frontier Town, and that's like in purple.
[40:16.54]This is like Mickey Mouse Land, and over here is Tomorrowland.
[40:19.20]Like, this is meaningless to me right now.
[40:21.98]Current.
[40:22.40]Successful.
[40:22.96]Fill.
[40:23.21]I have no quests.
[40:23.83]Thought I just had one.
[40:27.47]And we gotta turn this music down, because boy, is it really annoying.
[40:32.01]That's better.
[40:36.28]24-hour stream of Gothic.
[40:39.29]Uh, no.
[40:41.05]Let's save the game, though, for sure.
[40:42.69]I'm glad I have access to my mouse.
[40:50.99]Hey, thank you, Borislav, for the 15 bucks.
[40:54.27]Spiral Staircase, Rhinoceros Beetle, Ruined Street, Fig, Secret Emperor... What is this?
[41:03.21]What does any of this mean?
[41:07.27]I need my sword.
[41:07.97]I gotta talk to Diego.
[41:10.79]Another fine mess we've got ourselves into.
[41:14.96]What happened here?
[41:16.84]The orcs have won their war against King Robar.
[41:19.46]And now the orcs are sweeping through the land.
[41:21.68]Enslaving the humans.
[41:23.02]I'm now a gothic streamer.
[41:26.95]Okay, Lester.
[41:28.08]What happened?
[41:28.44]Oh, this is Gorn.
[41:29.06]Just like old times, huh?
[41:30.90]The orcs weren't all that strong.
[41:33.24]There must be other puffers.
[41:35.72]That took a long time.
[41:36.96]Wasn't he going to get some reinforcements?
[41:39.16]I think he was.
[41:41.84]Like, this dude was kind of elaborate.
[41:44.28]What does he got?
[41:44.72]Does he got a world map?
[41:46.52]It's a mana plant and booze.
[41:49.47]Cool.
[41:49.81]What about you?
[41:51.31]You got anything to say?
[41:52.27]I just can't go.
[41:52.75]See you later.
[41:53.29]Keep your chin up.
[41:59.32]Okay.
[42:00.78]So... What's going on here?
[42:04.88]What's my first mission?
[42:05.62]I like this guy.
[42:06.26]Shkeep, shkeep, shkeep, shkeep.
[42:28.45]Alright, let's go!
[42:29.01]Give me my, get my bow back.
[42:32.77]Alright, got my bow at least.
[42:33.85]My sword was in the grass over there.
[42:41.11]Sorry, dude.
[42:41.96]Sorry, like, Dark Souls Dan.
[42:45.54]What am I doing?
[42:46.06]Stand up.
[42:48.36]Should I just get out?
[43:01.50]Alright, well, it looks like, let me, Diego, let's move, buddy.
[43:06.76]We'll talk later.
[43:08.58]Okay.
[43:11.10]Where's my sword?
[43:14.86]It's out in the fucking orc's lair.
[43:16.45]There it is.
[43:16.93]Got it.
[43:19.69]So I just do whatever I want.
[43:23.33]That sounds like fucking fun.
[43:25.05]Alright, where am I right now?
[43:28.51]We're just gonna go explore?
[43:33.35]What's this sign say?
[43:34.31]Montero, Cape Dun, or Cape Dun.
[43:45.46]There's two Cape Duns.
[43:47.00]We're gonna go to Cape Dun 1.
[43:53.26]It's very pretty.
[43:55.12]This, like, rivals Breath of the Wild.
[43:56.96]It really does.
[43:58.00]Look at the fucking determinations.
[43:59.74]Go get a car.
[44:00.22]Cape next.
[44:00.56]Yeah.
[44:21.83]What are we going to do now?
[44:22.59]Please don't say that.
[44:23.09]That's what I had to do.
[44:24.25]You guys are lucky, man.
[44:24.85]That could have taken me weeks.
[44:25.93]Breath of the Wild isn't that great.
[44:27.41]Uh-oh.
[44:27.75]Be easy, man.
[44:48.28]saying Breath of the Wild isn't great is literally like saying you hate bacon you hate the smell you hate the taste and you hate the way it looks be careful saying that around here like these are video gamers in the chat be careful what's up pirates those rotten bastards made off with our treasure looks like it we'll have to deal with that later I'm afraid I want an apple see we have a problem what problem go talk to the village elder
[45:13.24]Bacon's not that great.
[45:14.50]Whoa!
[45:14.92]Straight up lie.
[45:15.34]I didn't talk to anyone.
[45:15.98]Alright, where is he?
[45:37.17]And where will we get new equipment now?
[45:39.15]But you know how this works.
[45:40.23]I love the texture of bacon.
[45:41.25]I love the smell of bacon.
[45:42.85]And don't let anyone take it from you.
[45:44.81]I love cooking bacon.
[45:45.39]And since the orcs are now the rulers of Matana, we will get some fine equipment from them.
[45:50.17]Sure.
[45:50.94]Hey, what are you doing?
[45:51.68]What are you doing, dude?
[45:52.86]You know me.
[45:53.94]Matana is now orc territory.
[45:56.62]But kissing up to orcs just isn't my thing.
[45:59.18]I will go south.
[46:00.98]I bet there are some opportunities.
[46:02.56]You can set out with Gorn.
[46:04.49]Alright, Gorn.
[46:05.56]You and me.
[46:06.38]You heard him.
[46:09.68]Let's go.
[46:10.34]You and me.
[46:11.16]We got things to do, man.
[46:12.26]Someone just said, fuck you, Jerma.
[46:14.92]What happened?
[46:15.54]What did I do?
[46:18.26]That person was like a voice changer?
[46:20.84]Alright, well, I'm gonna walk out and hopefully he comes.
[46:24.98]Alright, Gorn.
[46:31.37]Are you coming with me?
[46:32.05]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[46:34.59]That took a long time.
[46:39.30]I will go search for the rebels.
[46:42.00]I bet they're not all dead yet.
[46:44.20]Okay, show me where they are.
[46:45.42]Here we go.
[46:49.32]Gorn shows you the rebels' hideout.
[46:52.63]We got our first quest.
[46:54.21]Our first real quest.
[46:59.41]I got fireball.
[47:00.25]I'm ready to cast a fireball.
[47:03.51]I thought we had something special.
[47:04.69]What are you guys talking about?
[47:07.51]Because Breath of the Bacon isn't like a great game or something?
[47:09.77]I don't understand.
[47:10.37]Or Bacon of the Wild isn't fun?
[47:14.26]There's a guy behind you.
[47:15.96]Guy behind you.
[47:18.04]Baby dinosaur behind you.
[47:21.89]Turn around.
[47:24.55]It's not the smartest thing to keep running when there's a baby dino.
[47:31.65]Got it.
[47:31.91]Don't worry, I broke his neck.
[47:34.84]Easy.
[47:38.24]I hit him and his neck turned into spaghetti.
[47:39.92]We're fine.
[47:40.50]Al dente.
[47:44.12]He's got reputation.
[47:47.62]Way too many, like... Way too much shit.
[47:53.09]Like, Comic Sans just popped up on my screen.
[47:55.59]What happened?
[47:56.07]We found the hideout.
[47:56.91]Are these bad guys or good guys?
[48:00.01]Did he make that clear yet?
[48:05.57]Okay, sure.
[48:05.91]These are lumber workers.
[48:06.75]Let's head down here.
[48:07.55]Rebel Garfield.
[48:08.03]Alright, what's up, Garfield?
[48:08.59]Okay, I was going into the cave.
[48:09.59]I haven't saved it in a long time.
[48:35.82]Alright, let's go.
[48:41.22]What is even down here?
[48:43.92]Toad sweets?
[48:45.66]I'll take them.
[48:51.51]Left click in order to cast the spell.
[48:52.99]To improve your chance of success, hold down the left mouse button.
[48:55.31]What?
[48:56.85]I haven't used magic yet.
[49:07.37]You'd rather me take the sword out?
[49:10.56]Stop doing magic.
[49:14.40]Don't start the Garfield shit train.
[49:15.88]Well, I already did.
[49:18.10]I apologize for it.
[49:21.72]A Garfield shit train has started.
[49:23.50]There's no stopping it now.
[49:24.72]Welcome, stranger.
[49:25.90]Do you need food, clothes, or maybe a hefty swig from the bottle?
[49:30.16]Marlow will sell you everything.
[49:33.23]He just told me who he was.
[49:34.05]I don't need to worry.
[49:35.05]I am Marlow.
[49:36.31]I am the best merchant on the coast.
[49:38.07]Who's fucking talking?
[49:40.87]What interests me most are valuable items.
[49:43.83]Items such as silver, gold, and jewels.
[49:49.39]We have people in the cities who take care of our supplies.
[49:52.85]Marlow and Garfield.
[49:55.91]What do you do?
[49:56.79]I know ways to convert this stuff into... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:00.60]You got it.
[50:01.90]Show me your goods.
[50:02.46]Show me your goods.
[50:04.01]Here you can buy goods, sell them, or barter.
[50:05.43]Simply drag the items you want to buy from the vendor's inventory to the field in the lower left.
[50:10.03]Then drag any items you want to sell or trade in the field in the lower right.
[50:13.95]If the goods are of equal value or a trade is made, a trade is made.
[50:17.17]If the values are not equal, you can make up the difference by clicking on gold balance.
[50:22.60]I have 265.
[50:22.84]He has 13,000.
[50:23.08]Holy shit, this guy has 13,000 coins.
[50:41.16]Should I just fucking murder this guy?
[50:46.02]Why would you put that on your shop wall, by the way?
[50:48.68]I got like 13 grand.
[50:50.77]Not a big deal.
[50:53.49]Whatever.
[50:53.79]I don't need anything right now.
[50:58.75]I should just scam him?
[51:02.09]How many of you guys remember the old ring trick from Diablo II?
[51:05.29]That happened to me.
[51:08.91]I got a history story for you.
[51:09.91]So the ring trick in D2.
[51:12.05]While we talk to this guy.
[51:13.01]Once I have a second, we'll talk.
[51:14.77]I need weapons.
[51:15.27]We drove the orcs.
[51:15.69]Oh.
[51:35.21]Okay.
[51:35.49]You did it!
[51:35.99]You're wearing a pa- How can I support you?
[51:39.15]No, I don't want to ask my father!
[51:41.11]Oh god, ask your mother.
[52:05.66]So anyways, the ring trick in Diablo II was, if you don't know much about D2, D2 had very, very, very rare, unique rings in the game.
[52:16.37]And they had really, really shitty, like, blue-texted, like, plus one to, like, plus 10% faster hit recovery, right?
[52:24.79]Like, terrible, like, blue rings and, like, really, really great, like, fucking legendary-type rings.
[52:30.25]So the problem is they all shared the same art.
[52:32.52]There was only like four pieces of art for rings in Diablo II.
[52:37.10]So what would happen is you would put your shit in a trade window and somebody would put in like, for instance, like a stone of Jordan, which was like the currency at that given moment for Diablo II.
[52:47.63]And you would look at it and say, Stone of Jordan, cool.
[52:50.27]It would be like a red ring with like an opal in the middle.
[52:53.90]And okay, there it is.
[52:54.90]And you'd put up a bunch of your shit.
[52:56.12]And I put up a worm skull, which a worm skull, it was a pre-patch worm skull, which was very, very sought after.
[53:02.64]Very, very, very good shit.
[53:04.34]And I was an idiot at the time.
[53:06.05]I was like a child.
[53:07.35]So I didn't know that a pre-patch worm skull was worth like 25 stones of Jordan.
[53:12.81]It was something like that.
[53:13.47]It was something crazy.
[53:14.63]But I'm an idiot, and I just wanted a nice cool ring.
[53:18.43]So I put up my pre-patch worm skull, and this guy puts up the stone of Jordan.
[53:23.83]And he says, oh, hold on one second.
[53:25.07]Give me one second.
[53:25.81]My inventory is full.
[53:26.69]I've got to make some room.
[53:27.87]And he went back to his stash, came back,
[53:32.39]And said, oh, where's the worm skull?
[53:33.77]I put the worm skull up.
[53:34.75]And then he put up a ring that was the same exact art.
[53:38.93]But it wasn't the Stone of Jordan.
[53:40.29]It was like a blue shitty ring.
[53:41.37]And he instantly pressed the accept button.
[53:43.31]And then I pressed accept.
[53:45.29]And I got like scammed.
[53:46.17]I got like a really shitty ring.
[53:47.23]And what I did is I got really, really sad about it.
[53:50.19]And I sent him a bunch of direct messages talking about how like my brother gave me that worm skull.
[53:54.60]I went off on like a fucking giant tangent about it.
[53:57.06]I was like, my brother gave me that and he's like, we don't see each other ever and he's my best friend.
[54:02.24]I was lying.
[54:02.74]I was just making up a fucking extreme story to this guy.
[54:06.90]But that was the ring trick.
[54:08.76]And then obviously because it happened to me, I started doing it to people too because that's how it worked.
[54:14.09]And then I got really guilty about it.
[54:17.83]You're going to take a break.
[54:20.55]It's me, our brother.
[54:23.75]Like, when bad shit happened to you in a game, like, when you got scammed in a video game, then you started doing it, too, because you got angry.
[54:29.95]It's a fucking vicious cycle.
[54:31.35]Break the cycle.
[54:38.27]I did it once.
[54:39.27]I did it one time, and, like, I felt really bad, so I, like, gave it back.
[54:44.26]I couldn't do it.
[54:45.60]I couldn't go through with it.
[54:49.51]Liar.
[54:49.75]Liar.
[54:50.19]No, it's true.
[54:50.67]Dude, you know how many times I got fucked over in Diablo II?
[54:54.37]I did the thing where somebody told me we could like dupe items.
[55:11.33]Like, some guy told me we could duplicate all my items, and I had a bunch of good shit.
[55:14.87]So, like, there was this thing called, like, the pop, where you filled your fucking belt with potions, and your inventory with potions, and you died, and, like, if you had no room in your inventory, your character would pop, and all your shit would fall on the ground if you were killed.
[55:27.63]That's happened to me before.
[55:29.09]I've done the thing where you put the fucking items in the corner in the Rogan camp, and somebody telekinesises the shit through the wall.
[55:38.11]I've done it all.
[55:38.73]I've had it happen to me, all of them.
[55:45.19]I fell for all that shit.
[55:48.33]The orcs don't know about this rebel camp.
[55:50.21]I was like 14.
[55:51.88]I was like 13 or 14 or something.
[55:54.92]I was barely 15.
[55:57.70]Maybe.
[55:59.88]Tell me more about the rebels.
[56:01.47]We are the only... I would be the guy that falls for it.
[56:04.81]I was a kid.
[56:06.21]Orc patrols are up last night.
[56:09.01]Where are the orc patrols?
[56:09.73]Where are the orc patrols now?
[56:11.31]One orc patrol is constantly on the move.
[56:13.85]Right now, they are between us and our... I'm just a chronic sucker.
[56:17.29]...on a farm to the east.
[56:18.67]I was like fucking 14 or something.
[56:20.75]...take care of them now.
[56:23.96]I will go visit the orc patrol.
[56:26.04]I will go visit the orc patrol.
[56:27.82]Be careful.
[56:29.40]If they take you for a rebel, they will chop you to pieces.
[56:33.36]Alright, that's fine.
[56:35.80]So where are they?
[56:37.38]I'll take... do that.
[56:39.08]Where were they?
[56:40.18]Reddick and Adria.
[56:41.40]Okay.
[56:41.66]Okay, Reddick and Adria.
[56:44.44]Let's take a look.
[56:49.97]Where are we?
[56:54.85]Map.
[56:57.66]I want to look at the map, but it keeps like... Reddick and Adria.
[57:00.92]Why can I not look at the fucking map?
[57:07.12]World map.
[57:07.76]There we go.
[57:08.58]Okay, Reddick and Adria.
[57:10.40]There's Adria.
[57:11.10]Where's Reddick?
[57:16.17]What do you mean?
[57:17.05]Are you serious?
[57:17.87]Where's Reddick?
[57:24.15]Anybody understand this shit?
[57:33.10]I'm at Reddick.
[57:34.58]Why is it not on the fucking screen?
[57:35.60]Why is it not on the screen?
[57:38.29]Shouldn't it be popped up on the screen by now?
[57:42.43]You're on Reddit right now.
[57:44.39]Am I?
[57:46.01]Hey, what's up, Reddit?
[57:46.80]What's going on, guys?

[57:56.00]You know what I mean?
[57:57.22]Give me a follow.
[57:59.65]If you like what you see, give me a follow.
[58:00.79]Toss me a follow, man.
[58:04.87]Okay, so where is this place then?
[58:11.77]Between Reddick and Adria- Isn't it- We got- What in the name of God?
[58:25.07]We did- We just got pigs.
[58:27.79]This is- Am I seriously fucking running from pigs right now?
[58:34.93]Are you guys seriously doing this?
[58:36.14]Am I being chased by pigs?
[58:40.78]There's the orc camp.
[58:41.72]Oh shit.
[58:44.68]Get out of here.
[58:46.50]God damn it.
[58:47.22]This guy, that guy has a gun.
[58:53.50]Are they helping me?
[58:56.34]I think they're helping me.
[58:59.76]Okay, this is my chance.
[59:06.75]Get the fuck away from me, you stupid bird dinosaur.
[59:15.53]And now I'm not gonna be able to do anything.
[59:16.55]He's gonna keep doing this shit.
[59:19.47]Where'd my sword go?
[59:20.79]The boars are still alive.
[59:22.25]What a fucking nightmare.
[59:30.71]Why are the animals more dangerous than orcs with armor and shit?
[59:35.11]Alright, now I can just watch.
[59:36.71]None of this matters anyways.
[59:37.79]Alright, here.

[60:06.82]Wait, these are not bad guys.
[60:09.30]These actually are good guys.
[60:10.36]Is this my first choice of the game?
[60:16.91]Okay, we got a choice.
[60:30.57]Okay, that's just a light.
[60:31.67]I thought it was going to call down like a thunderstorm.
[60:34.41]Whenever my sword...
[60:37.68]Bundle of weapons.
[60:39.56]Okay.
[60:42.56]Can I take all this shit and it doesn't even matter?
[60:45.60]You can actually side with the orcs in this game.
[60:53.97]Interesting.
[60:55.07]Oh.
[60:59.87]Okay.
[61:01.31]They can't see me now.
[61:02.17]I'm in the clear.
[61:10.44]With that vest.
[61:20.19]Did you just call me a moron?
[61:33.54]I hit him right in the face with that one.
[61:34.90]Give me a parade game.
[61:45.77]This is... How many times do I have to hit you?
[61:51.31]I got an arrow coming out of my fucking head.
[61:54.47]Now he decides to take the sword out.
[61:56.87]Got him.
[61:58.99]Shit.
[62:03.01]Well, I'm glad we're going through Gothic 1, 2, and 3.
[62:04.61]There will be no fighting here, moron.
[62:11.40]You have gold for me.
[62:14.16]Well, I gotta get that back.
[62:15.02]This weapon belongs to me now, Mora.
[62:17.70]This weapon belongs to me now, you moron.
[62:25.26]Burn, heathen!
[62:27.80]Another one of those annoying beasts.

[62:48.39]Give me a lunch gold.
[62:55.79]Keep going.

[63:38.17]I can't even get up and move.
[63:42.96]Can I block his attacks?
[63:44.21]I can't block his attacks.
[63:45.25]No, there's a boar!
[63:57.27]Wait, he's not dead?
[63:59.11]He wants revenge.
[64:04.82]This is fucking chaos.
[64:07.16]He's not dead.
[64:12.92]Good.
[64:13.48]Now stay down.
[64:16.45]Revenge wasn't worth it.
[64:17.51]Give me my gold back.
[64:18.81]Thank you very much.
[64:19.67]Are those two still fighting over here?
[64:25.79]Yeah, they are.
[64:26.93]This is not going to end.
[64:29.40]Kill the aggressive wild boars.
[64:33.56]I got achievement for that.
[64:35.90]I got achievement for that.
[64:45.21]Give me an achievement for that one too.
[64:46.43]Alright, does this guy have any gold on him?
[64:50.77]No, that's too bad.
[64:51.49]That would have been fucking hilarious.
[64:55.13]Alright, so what am I doing?
[65:02.04]Apparently I had to do that.
[65:03.86]There's still more orcs to kill.
[65:05.04]Get him.
[65:19.13]Jesus Christ Dude I've spent I spent this Look here the Mora brought gold with him Look here the Mora brought gold with him
[65:50.01]I love this game.
[65:53.53]I just need to drink.
[65:54.93]Just drink it.
[65:57.13]I need to make friends.
[66:01.02]I need to like kill these guys first.
[66:05.66]And I don't even have a weapon.
[66:06.76]Might as well put on like a fucking dunce helmet.
[66:12.79]Give me my weapon back.
[66:17.14]Well, so, uh... Can I pick the sign up?
[66:22.20]Well, that's a very direct answer, thank you.
[66:26.55]Tomorrow, we're going to be playing Red Faction Guerrilla.
[66:33.45]Don't pick fights you can't finish.
[66:34.73]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[66:35.59]I'm trying to finish the fight.
[66:47.54]Do I have any other weapons?
[66:50.60]God damn it.
[66:51.34]Alright, I'm gonna... This guy's gonna get baited off the cliff and he's gonna die.
[67:01.20]No.
[67:02.16]Did I see Orc Slayer?
[67:03.22]Where's my weapon?
[67:04.16]Fuck me.
[67:04.62]Alright, off the cliff with you.
[67:08.13]You're gonna fall.
[67:08.93]No, you don't leash that far.
[67:13.03]My weapon's just on the ground somewhere.
[67:18.04]I love how we went through Gothic 1, 2, and 3, and, like, technical game problems caused me to do them all in one night.
[67:25.38]I had this pipe dream, guys, where I was gonna do Gothic 1, and, like, then Gothic 2, and then Gothic 3, and no, that ain't, that did not happen.
[67:35.11]I'm just a fucking moron walking around.
[67:37.11]I completed one quest.
[67:40.61]I completed one quest in three hours.
[67:44.83]That's hilarious.
[67:49.88]What a wonderful stream.
[67:52.56]One quest in three hours.
[67:57.18]Three Gothic games in three hours.
[68:03.56]Oh, God.
[68:05.72]Should I play Fortnite?
[68:06.62]I actually was thinking about playing it.
[68:08.38]I played it on the PS4 for like a minute.
[68:09.98]Okay, here's my big finale.
[68:13.49]Alrighty, big finale.
[68:16.41]You do all the work.
[68:19.41]He took my weapon, yeah.
[68:20.34]Well, now I'm gonna get it back.
[68:23.18]Get him.
[68:25.22]See, you act- He's hitting you with his sword.
[68:27.20]Don't you wanna fight him?
[68:28.86]There we go.
[68:29.56]I'm gonna heal him.
[68:37.27]This doesn't do anything.
[68:38.01]Have I ever played the Portal games?
[68:42.81]I've never played the Portal games on stream, no.
[68:46.45]Fortnite's a good time killer.
[68:48.19]It seemed pretty fun from what I tried.
[68:55.91]It's very addicting and fun.
[68:58.07]I could see that.
[69:00.42]Well, I hope you guys enjoyed the stream, because this is what you got for three hours.
[69:07.20]I'm holding a book in my hand.
[69:11.63]Whoa, this is an intense battle.
[69:13.85]This is very tense.
[69:25.44]What if you die?
[69:26.22]Okay.
[69:39.32]I'm just a camera now.
[69:41.52]Let's just use our sightseeing camera.
[69:48.14]Still alive.
[69:53.98]This has been a lame stream.
[69:58.02]I'm sorry to hear that.
[70:05.47]Well, there's the stream in a nutshell.
