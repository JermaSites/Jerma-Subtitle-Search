[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.20]Hello.
[00:11.04]Uh, so, uh, we are exactly on time for the time that I told Ster, which was three 30.
[00:20.87]Oops.
[00:23.01]Uh, I thought it was three.
[00:25.19]Uh, accidentally I said three 30 and oopsie daisy.
[00:29.78]Here we are at three 30.
[00:30.76]Exactly on time.
[00:33.54]Okay, sorry about that.
[00:35.26]But hey, you know, I usually start at six.
[00:37.18]We're about two and a half hours before earlier than that.
[00:39.90]Yeah, here we are.
[00:42.51]How you doing?
[00:45.03]I'm going to wait one or two minutes because I have something I want to very important to talk about.
[00:50.37]Very, very important Grotto Beasts information that you need to know.
[00:53.59]I want to make sure it's very clear and I'm going to make sure you know what's going on.
[01:01.90]So let's wait a minute.
[01:06.58]Why do you sound like a teacher?
[01:07.46]Get out of here.
[01:18.94]I played it with my friend and it was fun.
[01:20.82]That's awesome to hear.
[01:25.57]We hope you like it.
[01:27.55]Like we've said many times.
[01:28.33]Okay, I'm going to be playing Orcs Must Die 3 with Ster.
[01:34.41]It was in the call right now, but we are muted.
[01:38.07]He's using his teacher voice.
[01:39.51]Uh-oh.
[01:41.45]Uh-oh.
[01:41.77]That's how you know something is actually... This is actually really important, though.
[01:45.07]For real.
[01:49.22]It is an update on the shipping issue that some of the early orders have been seeing.
[01:57.32]And I want to make sure people know what's going on.
[02:03.18]This guy hates orcs.
[02:05.51]No.
[02:05.59]No.
[02:11.76]So just to give you a little bit of context, the Grotto Beasts project, uh, we had a pre-sale and a lot of people that ordered in that first week, they got an estimated ship date.
[02:25.75]And I want to, just anybody listening right now, if you have an estimated ship date in March, if you're one of the people with an estimated March ship date and you have not heard anything yet,
[02:37.15]represent is going to reach out represents the fulfillment company by the way so at some point tomorrow morning represents going to come out with a statement to everybody explaining kind of what happened and it's unfortunate that we have to do this but those early orders are going to have to wait a little bit longer and we're doing on our end here every single thing possible to make it so those early orders get fulfilled
[03:03.14]But Represents gonna come out with a statement.
[03:05.23]They're gonna explain what happened on their end.
[03:07.95]And that's pretty much all that we can do from here.
[03:13.34]But...
[03:15.69]the early orders that still have estimated March shipping dates, they now, they have complete priority.
[03:20.99]So this is not a case of, oh shit, I'm gonna have to wait till the May estimated shipping date.
[03:27.43]No.
[03:29.33]It's a manageable amount of orders that we think working with Represent here on correcting some of these issues, that they can actually fulfill these in not that much time.
[03:42.66]I'm really sorry that it came out like this.
[03:44.64]This is not, obviously, a lot of orders have already gone out.
[03:48.82]But Represent is aware of the problem on their end.
[03:51.46]And they're going to figure it out.
[03:53.35]And they're going to be sending out... You shouldn't have to do anything.
[03:57.09]There's probably nothing you have to do.
[03:59.29]They're going to reach out.
[04:01.47]As of tomorrow.
[04:04.19]So...
[04:06.45]That's the thing to talk about.
[04:08.57]That's the thing I wanted to point to.
[04:10.29]If you have an estimated March shipping date, keep an eye on your email.
[04:15.32]They're going to reach out in the next day.
[04:22.44]And they will tell you exactly the issues that they're having.
[04:29.55]And that's pretty much all I can say.
[04:32.95]We're really happy with people that have gotten it.
[04:34.91]Everyone seems to be excited about it.
[04:36.93]We're excited about it.
[04:38.45]People seem to be having fun.
[04:39.57]People are getting their orders.
[04:41.70]But that doesn't... I want to make sure that people that fucking ordered in the first few days get treated better.
[04:48.10]And that's exactly what's happening right now.
[04:49.78]And we're doing it literally the last two weeks.
[04:53.60]We've been desperately trying to make this problem solved.
[04:56.95]And Represent wants to as well.
[04:58.97]So they're going to handle this.
[04:59.91]If you have a March estimated ship date, please spread this around too.
[05:05.21]If you know of people that have a March estimated ship date that didn't get any information yet, tell them to keep an eye on their email as of tomorrow.
[05:19.45]I can't tell if what you're saying is real.
[05:20.87]This is very real.
[05:22.15]This is very real.
[05:23.57]This is not like a routine.
[05:25.39]I want to be very, very upfront and clear about this.
[05:32.42]But like I said, it's a manageable amount of orders that we can completely expedite it.
[05:37.60]Everybody that's an early order now has complete priority.
[05:40.62]And it's... It's not going to be, oh, now you have to wait all the way through May, like the May estimated ship dates.
[05:48.63]That is not happening.
[05:50.47]I can assure you of that.
[05:51.25]But anyways, let's go talk to Stirr.
[06:02.15]You have to defeat Corporate Andy.
[06:03.55]I mean, I have to.
[06:04.53]I mean, people are spending money on this shit.
[06:07.29]And I want to make sure that we can assure everybody that they're going to get what they ordered.
[06:11.18]And that's exactly what I'm fucking doing.
[06:14.00]You know what I mean?
[06:14.42]Like, people spent money on this shit.
[06:16.68]I got to be up front.
[06:19.86]So, we're taking care of it.
[06:22.60]Shouldn't be that much longer.
[06:23.59]There'll be a really comprehensive update tomorrow.
[06:27.13]Check your emails if you have a March estimated ship date.
[06:31.35]Ster isn't laughing at you.
[06:41.21]Hey.
[06:41.45]It's 3.30.
[06:42.21]Oh, it's 3.38.
[06:43.35]Oops.
[06:48.32]How the stream needs to progress.
[06:50.24]Yeah, I did.
[06:51.12]I did.
[06:51.62]I gave Ster a schedule.
[06:53.60]I did.
[06:55.24]So I assume your apology took a little longer than expected.
[06:58.30]Is everyone everyone very angry?
[07:01.30]No, no, it was, it was very clear.
[07:05.22]Oh, wait, you can still hear this.
[07:06.24]There you go.
[07:08.66]Yeah.
[07:08.76]But can you hear this?
[07:12.41]You fart?
[07:13.53]No.
[07:14.89]That's usually when, that's usually when you put a fart in.
[07:17.47]Just want to make sure you understand.
[07:18.83]Making sure everything was working.
[07:20.39]Alright.
[07:24.13]You, so are we, are we, we're playing Orcs Must Die 3?
[07:28.53]Yes.
[07:33.20]Did I press play?
[07:33.92]A new Orcs Must Die.
[07:35.31]You're the party leader.
[07:37.59]You are the operational manager.
[07:39.33]Oh, wait.
[07:40.55]I am.
[07:40.75]Oh, boy.
[07:41.63]Hold on.
[07:41.91]I'm not leaking, like, a room code or something, right?
[07:44.89]I have no idea.
[07:46.97]I didn't even, like, look at that.
[07:49.43]I don't think so.
[07:50.36]I think we're good.
[07:51.46]Oh, I think I have to ready.
[07:53.44]I'm ready.
[07:53.82]I just want to make sure it wasn't, like, there wasn't, like, a friend code.
[07:55.54]Alright.
[07:57.88]So this is why you want to explain why we're playing Orcs Must Die 3.
[08:00.54]You said that you were into it.
[08:01.44]You wanted to check it out.
[08:03.95]We're playing Orcs Must Die 3 because you contacted me and said, hey, do you want to play a game?
[08:08.59]And then I came up with a bunch of ideas.
[08:11.79]Five Nights at Freddy's?
[08:12.51]Because all of your ideas weren't very good.
[08:14.71]Five Nights at Freddy's Watch Along?
[08:16.57]Excuse me?
[08:16.93]Wasn't that also my idea?
[08:18.31]No.
[08:18.97]That was yours on like a whole other stream.
[08:21.09]Excuse me?
[08:21.61]Can I just get credit?
[08:23.13]Excuse me?
[08:24.39]The Five Nights at Freddy's Watch Along?
[08:25.79]I don't know.
[08:26.59]I thought that was your face for a second.
[08:29.60]I don't know why.
[08:30.12]I just saw a face on my screen.
[08:31.58]I thought it was you.
[08:32.34]Wait, you want to skip this?
[08:34.22]No.
[08:34.88]Oh.
[08:35.20]What's the lore?
[08:36.78]I don't know.
[08:56.61]don't don't you want to know the lore capabilities yeah a real ogre would have eaten you by now that's a crazy voice wow it's like you're allergic to saying smarts for an ogre right time is over
[09:28.69]I just want to kill some orcs, man.
[09:32.81]I want to get in there in game, man.
[09:35.01]Alright.
[09:36.21]Do we have to choose between?
[09:36.91]Who do you want to be?
[09:38.13]Wait, do they have different weapons?
[09:40.05]Do you want the magic longbow or do you want the blunderbuss?
[09:44.10]Gun or bow?
[09:46.40]I want the bow.
[09:47.08]I think the bow is the person who has to run around and do things more.
[09:50.14]Sounds good to me.
[09:50.94]At least that's how it was in the second one.
[09:57.76]It's like a YouTube video thumbnail.
[10:01.22]Enemies through the rift reduces rift points, right?
[10:03.50]So don't let them get through.
[10:05.40]This is your loadout.
[10:06.94]And then Blazing Trap spends money.
[10:09.09]Do we share money?
[10:11.79]I don't know.
[10:12.71]This is world first.
[10:14.63]No one's ever played this game before.
[10:16.07]Alright.
[10:17.33]Enemies through the rift.
[10:18.65]I think I'm playing at like 720p, by the way.
[10:21.11]I'm back at the menu.
[10:22.95]You are?
[10:23.95]Yeah.
[10:24.54]Like I'm back at like ready up again.
[10:26.40]Oh.

[10:30.85]Trap placement is critical.
[10:32.11]Click the trap you want to place.
[10:35.17]And look at the surface.
[10:37.77]Are we playing on a split screen?
[10:41.05]Oh, no.
[10:41.65]No, no.
[10:42.21]I failed to connect.
[10:43.49]We're not playing together at all.
[10:47.11]Waiting for player to connect.

[11:51.93]Well, uh... I guess we could do the tutorial?
[11:59.18]Wait, let me make sure my game is... That's so funny that that happened right when we connected into a game.
[12:06.26]That makes me very upset.
[12:07.83]Somebody was just sitting there waiting to press the button.
[12:14.59]Alright, am I... What frame... What...
[12:19.24]Graphics quality.
[12:19.98]Yeah, I think it's good.
[12:26.61]Good, uh, so.
[12:29.67]You guys just need to play Roblox instead.
[12:31.79]I don't think I could convince her to play Roblox.
[12:35.07]That would take an unbelievable amount of convincing, but we already did.
[12:38.45]Yeah, but a second time.
[12:42.43]Didn't we do everything there was to do?
[12:45.53]Didn't we play literally every game mode?
[12:50.46]Hmm... yeah uh people are saying Five Nights at Freddy's watch along but the plan was I was gonna raid Ster and stay in the call so I could get it in real time.
[12:59.46]So we're not- we're not quite ready for that, I would just- I would have just turned my stream on to make a Grotto Beasts shipping update and then raid you.
[13:07.46]So that's- is that the stream?
[13:09.46]Welcome to the corporate stream.
[13:10.00]Is that what we're doing today?
[13:12.00]No, we're playing Orcs Must Die. Maintenance only takes like 30 seconds, right?
[13:17.00]I- sometimes it takes like 30 minutes.
[13:26.69]And you're the one who wanted to start this early.
[13:30.07]What?
[13:30.49]No, that's not true.
[13:34.24]You are the early Andy.
[13:40.08]I start at 6 p.m.
[13:42.29]Pacific.
[13:45.58]Let's do a podcast.
[13:47.06]Alright.
[13:47.40]I mean, let's meet.
[13:49.94]I mean, I have a long questionnaire for you.
[13:53.54]I've been waiting for your judgment on a very particular situation.
[13:56.40]Okay.
[13:57.52]But what do you want from me?
[13:59.80]You're going to have to stay with me the whole time because I feel like as I'm starting to explain this, you're going to cut me off.
[14:04.36]But I really want you to be the judge and like, arbitrate this situation.
[14:10.44]Okay.
[14:10.62]Are you down?
[14:11.06]Um, no, but I think you're going to ask it anyways.
[14:14.23]Okay.
[14:14.99]You are, you're like a judge in a court.
[14:18.00]It is, it is your decision to like figure out if I'm guilty or not.
[14:22.58]Um, I
[14:24.78]As an individual, I knew that there was a police sting operation going on, you know, where they like be like the guy walks in the room and like buys prostitution.
[14:31.56]Okay.
[14:32.22]And the cops jump in the moment you like hand over the money and there's an exchange.
[14:35.80]They run the room.
[14:37.04]You're arrested and they take you away.
[14:38.50]Okay.
[14:39.34]Okay.
[14:39.60]So I come in there, um, knowing that it's a sting operation.
[14:45.72]Cause I'm trying to, I'm trying to get one over on the police.
[14:49.48]I do the whole thing.
[14:50.42]I hand over the money.
[14:52.95]But as it's revealed later, I have no genitals.
[14:58.37]So I end up in court.
[15:00.33]Am I guilty of a crime?
[15:01.59]If I'm like, oh, hey babe, why don't you knock on my wood?
[15:04.92]And then I don't even have any genitals.
[15:07.26]I'm completely smooth.
[15:08.72]You're the judge.
[15:09.30]What do you say?
[15:13.72]What?
[15:13.98]Well, because the crime is purchasing prostitution, but I can't, I can't.
[15:22.31]I'm giving her money for something that I don't have well uh hold on there though you you are the exchange the exchange has happened and you're you're exchanging I'm being I would ask her for something very specifically requiring the the having genitals part
[15:42.25]I'm just being nice and not going into explicit detail because I know there's a lot of like six year olds here.
[15:47.24]But alright, but but but okay, but your intent was not Oh, come over and like play cards.
[15:52.72]Your intent was in a sexual nature.
[15:55.38]Is that incorrect?
[15:58.20]Yeah.
[16:00.36]But I can't.
[16:03.08]I'm a smoothie.
[16:06.43]okay um well I'm not I'm not a judge so I don't think I can give you an answer here but I I wonder if intent would be a case here I have no idea I'm not a fucking lawyer I thought you went to law school I've been wondering about that for I don't know I don't know what the answer to that question is well if the answer is no then could you counter sue
[16:34.09]Who is countersuing you?
[16:36.01]No, I'm countersuing because you get brought to court and, like, you get arrested for, like, something, like, a crime you didn't commit.
[16:46.64]What's your diet like the last few months?
[16:49.16]My diet?
[16:49.68]Yeah.
[16:50.02]Are you getting enough, like, B vitamins?
[16:52.56]I started doing fasting again.
[16:54.56]I'm on attempt number two.
[16:56.53]Two meal a day.
[16:57.21]You're getting, like, all your B vitamins, right?
[16:59.33]And, like, vitamin, like, C and E and everything?
[17:02.17]I'm eating, like, nothing.
[17:06.05]I haven't eaten anything in like two weeks.
[17:09.26]You should probably consume some food.
[17:12.02]I would recommend a nice balanced salad with maybe some lean protein, maybe turkey, maybe some fish on it or something.
[17:18.00]Well, not on the salad, but you know, in general.
[17:21.20]Do you eat breakfast?
[17:23.80]No.
[17:24.20]Start doing that.
[17:26.70]Is that what you think this is?
[17:27.80]You're the judge.
[17:30.60]I come into court and you're like, you're eating breakfast, kid.
[17:33.65]How much breakfast are you eating?
[17:36.35]Are you getting like a bunch of whole grains?
[17:38.29]Because they're necessary.
[17:40.77]No.
[17:43.21]What about sunshine?
[17:44.98]Are you out of the house?
[17:45.90]At least you are.
[17:48.08]I got a blood test and my doctor was like, you need to take vitamin D. Yeah.
[17:53.16]And then I did.
[17:54.00]And then she's like, okay, take less vitamin D.
[17:58.79]Yeah, I would say going outside, even for five minutes, just to let the sun hit you in the face for five minutes is something everybody should be doing.
[18:09.05]I go outside.
[18:09.61]Okay, so, yeah, I've ruled.
[18:12.49]Go outside and eat, guess what, B vitamins.
[18:16.25]Okay, so I don't go to prison.
[18:19.57]I didn't say that.
[18:22.39]Oh.
[18:25.29]Touch grass.
[18:28.62]Alright, is it back up?
[18:29.90]Is Steam back up?
[18:30.80]It's not.
[18:31.52]It's not, unfortunately.
[18:36.73]Shit.
[18:37.59]We're gonna have to talk to each other.
[18:39.35]Oh, no.
[18:40.45]You're gonna have to, like, talk unfiltered for more than 10 minutes?
[18:44.99]I'll be unfiltered.
[18:47.76]Also, you know, what are you doing for fun nowadays?
[18:50.16]You know, on a nice day out.
[18:51.78]Oh, no.
[18:52.48]I got a topic for you.
[18:53.32]Listen to this.
[18:54.26]Okay, so you're in kind of the art world.
[18:57.26]You're an artist.
[18:58.72]Yeah.
[18:59.02]Do you know what I started doing recently?
[19:01.58]Art.
[19:02.42]I guess based on that, you started doing art recently.
[19:05.66]What kind?
[19:07.44]Pottery.
[19:09.20]Close.
[19:10.40]Like clay.
[19:11.68]Yeah.
[19:12.66]Like clay shaping.
[19:14.88]I have been molding clay and just kind of messing around, making little creatures and objects and stuff.
[19:26.09]That's so you.
[19:27.25]What?
[19:29.43]That's- that's very you. Creatures. How are the- do you have any creatures you can show off like on cam? You got a creature you can grab?
[19:35.00]I could... I could get a creature right now.
[19:39.00]Could you?
[19:40.00]Yeah. You want me to get a creature?
[19:42.00]Yeah.
[19:44.00]I'll be right back.
[19:47.00]So for a lot of like um-
[19:49.00]give me one sec.
[19:50.00]A lot of uh... troubled young children around Jerma's age, they would have- Roger Rabbit.
[19:53.59]Oh by the way, I just want to make sure that um it's very clear too that you are no longer coming through my stream so however you want to- yeah I just want to make sure that's- because every time I walk away uh you-
[20:05.00]Are you walking away for that long?
[20:06.00]No for like maybe 30 seconds.
[20:09.00]Okay well, you've been explaining this for like 30 seconds.
[20:11.00]Okay, so yeah but- you just- you're not- you're not going to come through my stream.
[20:16.00]Okay.
[20:18.00]Yeah he's not coming through.
[20:23.87]Nobody can hear him.
[20:24.77]Alright, I'll be right back.
[21:22.98]Okay, I'm back, I'm back.
[21:24.12]Oh shit, I just, like, broke it!
[21:25.70]Look what you did!
[21:27.36]Look what you just did!
[21:28.24]Look, you just did this.
[21:30.09]I did this.
[21:30.69]I walked in here and I sat down and I heard- I was rushing because I thought you would make me weird.
[21:36.23]Wait, I- wasn't I muted?
[21:38.13]Yeah, but I don't know, you're- I don't want you to be weird on your stream either.
[21:41.49]Oh yeah, and like, do another jump scare on your stream somehow.
[21:44.34]Alright, here we go.
[21:46.36]You ready?
[21:48.42]Are you ready to see one of the creatures?
[21:52.06]I'm ready.
[21:59.88]I broke him, but he's not supposed to look like this.
[22:03.08]He's not supposed to look like this.
[22:05.32]Hold on, it's... He had wings and I accidentally ripped him off.
[22:16.99]He's like a... I don't know.
[22:20.29]What the hell is that?
[22:21.99]It's not painted.
[22:23.05]It's not painted yet.
[22:24.45]And it's not even fully sculpted.
[22:25.77]You didn't even see the texture.
[22:28.75]You didn't even see the texture.
[22:31.59]This is just a prototype.
[22:37.65]It's a prototype.
[22:41.41]It looks like Jar Jar Binks.
[22:44.03]What?
[22:45.35]No, it doesn't.
[22:46.77]You look very happy in the picture I took to show my stream.
[22:50.27]I've never seen you smile this much or have this much joy.
[22:53.92]So I'm glad you found a hobby that really works for you.
[22:57.28]What's his name?
[22:59.00]I didn't... Well, I can't name him until I put the wings back on.
[23:02.21]I accidentally ripped his legs off, too.
[23:03.53]Oh, wait!
[23:06.11]There's another... Let me get another one.
[23:07.27]This one... This one... This was just a prototype.
[23:08.85]Hold on.
[23:11.19]There's more.
[23:22.08]oh hey guys did he leave me unmuted when he walked away I'm gonna tell you about my giblets okay he did I am over I
[23:40.10]Does Jermis stream with anyone else where he's like, I need to be, like, I need to show caution?
[23:46.30]When he plays with, like, Vinny, is it like, oh, dude, like, I'm going to get up.
[23:50.32]I can't let him, like, talk to my chat.
[23:59.32]What is he saying?
[23:59.76]What's he doing?
[24:02.22]Stop.
[24:02.66]Stop it.
[24:03.10]Stop it.
[24:04.22]What?
[24:04.52]Ready?
[24:04.80]Let me show some more.
[24:05.94]I'm ready.
[24:06.88]This was the, alright, let me show this.
[24:10.62]Um, this is like a kind of like a ghost or something?
[24:17.86]Do you like it?
[24:21.25]Oh, what?
[24:22.71]It's a ghost.
[24:24.43]That one doesn't look like anything.
[24:25.67]Yes, it is.
[24:27.01]Look at this.
[24:27.63]It's a mouth.
[24:28.15]You see it.
[24:31.47]Look, there's a side profile.
[24:32.49]He's going...
[24:37.02]I liked the other one.
[24:38.66]I can't.
[24:40.22]I can't understand this one.
[24:41.42]You can't see this.
[24:42.70]Oh, I kind of see it now.
[24:44.90]Okay.
[24:51.23]What about making beehives?
[24:54.91]I might make some bees.
[24:55.75]It's a golf ball, dude.
[25:01.17]Shut up.
[25:01.55]He fucking picked up a golf ball.
[25:04.55]This is the start of a kind of a half rhinoceros, half elephant creature.
[25:12.69]Started his head.
[25:14.87]Why am I taking... Yeah.
[25:22.72]He's going like,
[25:27.25]This is the start of kind of like a bird, like a weird duck or something.
[25:31.93]That's his mouth.
[25:32.73]I'm going to put big eyes on top.
[25:38.12]And he's going like... Okay, that one also doesn't... It's like very nice shapes and contours, but it doesn't look like a bird.
[25:46.57]It's not done.
[25:46.93]It doesn't look like anything.
[25:47.77]This is the head.
[25:48.69]This is literally the face.
[25:49.87]I've made the face, like the head.
[25:51.07]Do you have like a kiln in your house?
[25:54.13]No, this stuff is air dry.
[25:58.12]Some of this is air dry or what?
[25:59.62]Some of it's not.
[26:03.76]You didn't say how can you can't see the ghost?
[26:09.20]Yeah, you can.
[26:09.58]It's just not close enough.
[26:13.66]I just like burger the mic.
[26:16.80]What were those things that growing up as kids where you like threw them on the ground?
[26:21.73]they were all they were all like monsters like that there was a whole game for it it was kind of like pogs but there was like little creature figures or something this could be a pineapple I don't know I don't remember this could be a pineapple and sometimes hey those of you artists out there sometimes you start with an idea crazy and you can turn it it can turn into something else
[26:47.71]do a creature sculpting stream only if sir does it with me I'll do it with you 100 I just I actually don't want to do with you okay probably do that like Holly instead I mean I'm kind of artistic and I could I could probably you know meet you halfway on that would you actually want to like you want to do like a creature craft off yeah I mean I got a little bit of experience on you man
[27:13.69]I mean, I'll make something that looks like something.
[27:16.27]Okay, hold on.
[27:20.68]Crazy bone crafting session.
[27:24.16]Hold on a second.
[27:25.88]You think you're going to do better than the rhinoceros elephant?
[27:30.90]I mean, art is subjective and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[27:34.82]But I think I can beat that.
[27:37.63]Okay.
[27:41.40]He's cute.
[27:42.12]I like that one a lot more than the ghost.
[27:45.08]See?
[27:45.62]You didn't even give it a chance.
[27:46.98]And it's not even done.
[27:49.18]Can you see the texturing that I did?
[27:51.22]Have you painted any of them?
[27:52.68]No.
[27:55.42]It's hard to see the texture.
[27:59.99]Oh, yeah.
[28:01.61]I sat there and individually put little bubbles all over them.
[28:08.70]There's more too, but kind of just prototypes.
[28:11.18]This sounds, this is great.
[28:12.46]This sounds like this is being on the toilet for you, but like without being in the bathroom.
[28:20.41]What?
[28:21.83]Like it's relaxing.
[28:23.47]You can just take your time with your craft.
[28:24.99]You don't have to like, you don't have to be on the toilet.
[28:33.78]But why do I have to?
[28:39.61]What does that matter?
[28:41.09]Say everything you just said one more time.
[28:42.09]When we were playing Elden Ring, you were saying that your most relaxed time is when there's nothing else to do.
[28:46.84]You're in the bathroom.
[28:47.82]No, that was Ember.
[28:49.06]You're 45 minutes on the toilet.
[28:50.48]985.
[28:51.52]Oh, no, for sure, yeah.
[28:53.78]Okay, well, this is like pooping
[28:57.12]But it has like a better outcome.
[29:00.30]I'm going to do so much crazy stuff too.
[29:01.56]I'm going to like, I don't know.
[29:03.90]I'm just saying, you know, I'm one of those people that makes like 15 different heads of various shapes.
[29:10.62]You're going to go any bigger?
[29:12.46]I want to get a Jerma original.
[29:14.26]I want a Jerma original signed.
[29:16.34]I'm going to put it in a vault.
[29:19.36]I want to make like a big building and have like a bunch of these weird creatures just hanging out in front of it.
[29:28.00]But if you want it- you want to put it in the vault, you can.
[29:34.00]Hold on, this comment-
[29:35.00]Somebody's saying I'm ignoring- ignoring- I ignored you?
[29:38.00]St- someone in your chat said Ster remembers what Jerma says and it's awkward bringing it up because you don't.
[29:45.00]No.
[29:47.00]It's like what is he talking? The bathroom?
[29:52.85]I just- I- sometimes like audio comes in this way and then just like goes out that way.
[29:57.27]And it's just it's just gone.
[29:59.43]And it depends.
[30:02.01]Or sometimes I'll just talk and let me OK, let me ask you a question, Mr. Let me get this on you.
[30:08.42]So you asked me a question in court.
[30:10.78]I'm asking you a question in court now.
[30:14.18]How many words do you think you have said recorded?
[30:20.00]What- why is this being brought before a judge? The judicial system.
[30:24.00]Because the reason why- the reason why I have so much time remembering things is because I feel like I- I say so many things every day and I'm recorded so much.
[30:33.00]Oh you say so much so like- like 90% of it is- you can just throw it out.
[30:37.00]No, it's just- like it's like millions and millions of sentences over like 15 years- like 12 years, whatever it's been on like YouTube and Twitch and stuff.
[30:48.02]No, no, I mean, like on a grand scale, I agree that I forget most of the things I say on stream, even when people bring it up like two days later.
[30:54.42]And that's the judgment right there.
[30:55.77]Thank you very much.
[30:56.45]You can go home now.
[30:59.37]But like things that like someone says to me or that I say to someone, like conversations with like a real human, I'll remember that because, you know, like I respect you.
[31:07.67]Well, I remember major things that I talked, but like just random, just stuff that we just bring up on a regular kind of daily basis, sometimes just gone.
[31:16.12]I feel like shitting for 45 minutes a major part of your life.
[31:19.18]Well, I know I know what I'm talking about.
[31:20.86]But you but you but I knew that I did that.
[31:23.22]I know that I use the bathroom for a long period.
[31:25.56]But you were equating it to like crafting creatures.
[31:28.96]And I was sitting there for a second going.
[31:31.28]It's not.
[31:32.94]I had to connect that.
[31:33.62]Well, like wasn't this recently too that like you had a like your family was in town or something.
[31:38.94]You went out for like a big fancy dinner.
[31:40.38]Like everyone got all dressed up.
[31:41.92]And you got up to go to the bathroom.
[31:43.56]And you were gone just like the whole night.
[31:48.56]No! What?
[31:49.09]Yeah. Yeah, like before you went to the bathroom, you like dug in your backpack that you brought.
[31:52.09]Like you're in- you're in like a suit in a nice restaurant. You dug in your backpack and had all your toys and stuff to like keep you entertained.
[31:56.09]You picked out an iPad and you were just gone for two hours in the bathroom.
[32:01.09]Um no this- this is- this is not a real. I don't know where you got this from.
[32:06.09]There was a squeaky toy in it too, like everything you could possibly need for a moment you're like oh I'm gonna get bored at dinner.
[32:14.09]You... told me...
[32:17.66]You were not going to bring up the squeaky toys that I like to have.
[32:21.53]I'm going to have to talk to you off stream about this.
[32:25.87]Because my backpack of squeaky toys is something that you said we weren't going to be discussing ever.
[32:30.35]But now we're going to?
[32:34.42]It seemed like appropriate to bring up considering you were pretending to not remember.
[32:38.84]You're looking kind of big, by the way.
[32:40.84]What do you mean?
[32:44.10]No, fuck off.
[32:46.06]Are you serious?
[32:48.74]Have you been making your webcam bigger?
[32:51.44]I mean, it's bigger than yours.
[32:53.14]Are you fucking kidding me?
[32:53.90]I'm making sure.
[32:54.56]No, it's not going to be like that.
[32:57.72]Is it webcam bigger?
[33:01.34]Like I'm trying to like react to what you're doing and you're like, I should be the prominent focus of the fucking what's going on.
[33:09.71]I don't think so.
[33:10.71]I'm just trying to make sure that my webcam is bigger than yours.
[33:15.12]I thought you were doing a small webcam.
[33:16.30]I just wanted to make sure I was bigger than it.
[33:19.58]Steam up!
[33:20.28]Steam is up!
[33:23.52]Imagine sitting on the- Imagine you go into the bathroom and somebody's playing with dog toys.
[33:29.22]Well, you wouldn't see them.
[33:30.00]You'd just hear, like, squeaking coming from, like, one of the stalls.
[33:33.30]Like, childlike laughter.
[33:34.96]Alright, let's go for it.
[33:37.96]Hey, that was kind of fun.
[33:39.36]That was cool.
[33:40.90]Yeah, well, I started a new hobby recently.
[33:43.44]Let's play work to my style.
[33:46.58]Oh, did you... Wait, I... What are you... Is this a funny joke?
[33:50.26]Mine's not, like, cool.
[33:52.00]Who cares?
[33:52.32]It's probably cool.
[33:53.16]New hobbies are always interesting.
[33:54.24]What are you talking about?
[33:55.56]I started, um... I bought some rollerblades.
[34:00.51]How is that not cool?
[34:02.21]Is that... Is that cool or not cool?
[34:04.03]I feel like rollerblades are the most not cool thing you can wear.
[34:07.89]No, I don't think so.
[34:10.47]It's like a fun outdoor activity where you can... It takes, like, a little bit of a skill.
[34:14.47]Yeah, so I've been outside.
[34:15.57]I've seen grass.
[34:15.91]It takes a lot of skill, actually.
[34:20.35]No, that's cool.
[34:22.01]Do not ever doubt something that you're doing.
[34:24.47]And if it's, like, cool or not.
[34:25.67]Do you want to do it?
[34:28.74]Yeah.
[34:29.62]Then it's cool.
[34:32.04]Then it's cool.
[34:32.52]You understand?
[34:35.54]Yeah.
[34:38.48]Okay, I think we can play.
[34:43.60]I'm ready.
[34:44.00]Oh, there's no audio.
[34:51.15]Do we have audio?
[34:52.01]Yes.
[34:52.41]Alright.
[34:53.65]Do we need to see this?
[34:54.99]You saw this already?
[34:58.38]Yeah, we saw it.
[34:59.00]Skip.
[34:59.10]Skip.
[34:59.22]Alright.
[34:59.52]So Orcs Must Die three.
[35:12.92]They say this is the third in the series, but it's actually the fourth or the fifth, or maybe even the sixth.
[35:18.64]Let me turn this up.
[35:20.24]Okay, so we have... Do you want help with the basics?
[35:23.04]Is what it's asking me to ask you that?
[35:25.43]Yeah, I think it's just giving you like a quick rundown.
[35:27.49]Let's try out these traps for real.
[35:37.82]Okay.
[35:38.32]Roll over enemies or gear to learn more.
[35:40.79]Okay.
[35:42.15]Okay.
[35:42.59]So I think it just works like all the other ones, right?
[35:45.47]Yeah.
[35:46.09]I wonder if we share currency though.
[35:50.98]Yeah.
[35:52.18]Okay.
[35:52.52]Back to basics.
[35:55.92]Okay, so I've got the spike wall and the spike ground on my loadout right now.
[36:01.00]I think that's all we can use, right?
[36:02.40]Oh, I can use the bow too.
[36:04.18]We got like a whole inventory to buy stuff.
[36:06.83]There's someone talking to me.
[36:07.75]Alright, do you have 1,400 or do we share?
[36:12.73]I have 2,000.
[36:13.11]Okay, so we don't share.
[36:14.67]I'm going to put two here.
[36:16.29]On the mini-map, I can see where you are.
[36:18.92]And then I'm going to go one right down the middle here.
[36:25.27]And then one right down the middle there.
[36:27.34]And I'm out of money.
[36:28.14]Good luck.
[36:28.46]It's up to you.
[36:30.44]Okay, I'm doing spike walls.
[36:33.28]The horde's coming when you press G. Oh, so we're not on a time limit.
[36:40.19]Is there a reload?
[36:40.73]No.
[36:42.01]Alright, let's just do it.
[36:45.37]There's a slow-moving projectile and a fast-moving projectile.
[36:54.83]Good.
[36:55.47]Oh, it's mouse scroll.
[37:06.60]It's easy to switch that way.
[37:12.04]Now it's too loud.
[37:12.74]I'll fix it in like an hour.
[37:17.82]I wonder if you can pull aggro and make them walk over it too.
[37:23.69]Why are you not talking?
[37:26.55]My game FPS is really low.
[37:27.65]I'm sorry.
[37:28.05]I'm sorry.
[37:28.77]I'm sorry.
[37:29.35]I know that like in the play-by-play, the minute-by-minute, I was supposed to make a joke right now.
[37:34.49]I'm sorry.
[37:37.43]More enemies on the way.
[37:41.79]Do you forgive me?
[37:43.53]Yeah, I do.
[37:45.03]Okay.
[37:46.37]I'm going to fill this up.
[37:51.09]Fill what up?
[37:52.00]Oh.
[37:53.00]Yeah.
[37:54.00]Yeah it's the tutorial, you know? It'll be fine.
[38:02.00]Somebody just said roller skating is NOT cool.
[38:07.00]I was watching a whole video about how not cool roller skating is... on the break.
[38:17.00]Nice job.
[38:20.22]I'm- I'm curious actually because a lot of the like roller skating isn't cool is like very much like a 90s thing where like... where all the extreme sports were popular.
[38:30.00]So like if someone missed out on the 90s because they were just like in a black void before being born-
[38:35.00]Well, I think it's roller skating-
[38:35.00]I wonder what their opinion on roller skating would be? Given they didn't get the whole like smear campaign that skateboarding put on roller skating.
[38:43.00]Well there's roller blading and roller skating, right?
[38:48.00]I mean they're basically the same.
[38:49.00]But are you talking about the four um kind of the two and then two two in the front and two in the back or you mean like the blade like rollerblade?
[38:57.74]Inline skates they're in- inline. Like-
[38:59.00]Okay so... yeah... so we're talking about inline skating then yeah that's I think that is pretty synonymous with being cool.
[39:13.00]I think you're fine.
[39:17.00]I gotta be cool.
[39:18.00]And even if it was rollerskates, well whatever, fucking own it.
[39:22.00]I think- I think they're making a comeback roller skates.
[39:27.14]There's a whole bunch of like weird roller derby things that are like, guys, let's go fucking, let's derby it up.
[39:32.77]Is that something that you're, are you into the idea of kind of doing like a roller derby thing?
[39:37.45]No.
[39:40.31]No, I'm not.
[39:42.41]Okay.
[39:42.59]But I know that it's like, I've seen more and more of it.
[39:46.09]And certainly Austin has a lot of weird stuff like that.
[39:49.45]Vegas probably has a lot of it.
[39:50.78]I don't know.
[39:51.42]There's a lot of like weird hobbies.
[39:54.24]Yeah, I would imagine.
[39:55.06]I bet there is.
[39:59.03]I think you need to unleash the horde.
[40:01.47]I'm doing it.
[40:01.93]It's a good thing we're on, like, baby mode.
[40:08.38]We're on the... I don't think we can even select a higher difficulty.
[40:10.52]I just did the regular one.
[40:18.26]But... Imagine how badass you'd look pulling up to Jerma's house and skidding to a stomp in Rollerblades.
[40:25.73]Seriously badass.
[40:29.84]Yeah, I'm imagining you doing that.
[40:32.23]And then you go like, whoa!
[40:34.33]Alright, dude, let's go get something to eat.
[40:35.77]And I'm like, hold up.
[40:36.51]And I have to take my skates off for 40 minutes.
[40:39.27]I'm imagining you doing the big, like going super fast and doing the thing where you go inside and kind of do the kind of spin out thing.
[40:48.50]Yeah.
[40:48.90]But you were going a little too fast and you have to do like the run in place kind of thing while you're falling and you fall, fall, fall, fall, running, running, running.
[40:56.06]And then you go right into the grass.
[41:01.76]Okay, but what if I like didn't fall?
[41:03.50]And then I just close the door.
[41:08.16]You're sending some mixed messages.
[41:09.80]Is it cool or is it not cool?
[41:12.06]That is like super mixed message.
[41:14.54]No, it is cool.
[41:20.07]Wait, upgrades?
[41:27.13]Upgrades, dude?
[41:28.93]Yeah, I think you get to like buy new...
[41:32.57]Oh, and like your weapon might have a way to unlock the next tier.
[41:39.63]I have to get 50 headshots with my bow.
[41:41.51]Oh, we should probably figure this out then.
[41:46.53]Because we don't want to upgrade the same stuff.
[41:49.61]I'm upgrading my bow.
[41:55.60]Purchase upgrades, complete milestones to unlock a unique upgrade.
[41:58.62]Okay.
[42:02.86]Blade Staff?
[42:06.14]I kind of like this.
[42:07.94]I'm kind of confused.
[42:12.85]Reduce mana cost?
[42:16.89]I went all in on this.
[42:17.63]I don't know if that's a stupid idea.
[42:19.19]It seems like everything has its own upgrade points.
[42:25.92]I used everything on my bow and I still had more for the other traps.
[42:31.66]I went all in on the weapon.
[42:33.97]I mean, yeah, I skipped the tutorial.
[42:40.12]Was that the worst weapon?
[42:41.26]Oh, that's alright.
[42:49.59]What's your favorite kind of meat?
[42:52.83]uh harami skirt steak is really tossing us into the deep end of the pool I like brisket brisket's good sessions on on that note I have a good question if you could have the animalistic trait from one animal finally what would it be to be real heroes like maximilian I will settle for you two staying alive keeping the orcs um that's interesting
[43:21.67]I mean, the easiest thing is, say, lion, because you'd be super strong and fast, but I don't know, maybe like chimpanzee.
[43:27.57]I got a good one.
[43:29.23]I was thinking about this long and hard, and I have a really good one.
[43:32.07]The male anglerfish.
[43:35.14]Explain.
[43:35.96]Specifically.
[43:37.72]They attach to a female anglerfish, and they just sort of become part of their body.
[43:45.48]They sort of like meld into the female, and they're almost like a parasite.
[43:50.51]Because at a certain point they just sort of like absorb into their body.
[43:58.31]Well, I'd be a chimpanzee because they can like jump around fast and they're like very noble.
[44:03.89]Yeah, looking good.
[44:04.91]They're very noble.
[44:05.87]No chimpanzees like known for ripping people's faces off.
[44:11.31]Very noble.
[44:12.61]What's the most noble animal do you think?
[44:15.41]We didn't even put traps down.
[44:16.61]What's going on?
[44:17.47]I did.
[44:18.08]It took two seconds.
[44:21.81]The most noble animal?
[44:24.99]Noble as in like born to a noble family or like... I don't know.
[44:32.43]Elephant?
[44:33.15]Okay.
[44:38.89]Oh, he just went... I screwed that up.
[44:43.37]Oh, there's another door.
[44:47.25]Oh, no one was coming out of it yet.
[44:49.47]Do you want me to focus on this one?
[44:51.39]Yeah.
[44:55.53]I'm so bad at this.
[44:58.59]Be nice to yourself, you know?
[45:01.07]That's true.
[45:01.73]That's right.
[45:03.16]You're a lot better at this than you are at sculpting.
[45:19.97]We doing okay over there?
[45:26.60]Enjoy your roller skating.
[45:29.59]I mean, as long as you enjoy it.
[45:33.53]But you made a competitive.
[45:35.65]That was you when you said that.
[45:38.11]I wouldn't be able to out sculpt your Rhino.
[45:39.99]I was kidding though.
[45:40.75]I was like a little jab that wasn't real.
[45:43.09]Oh, mine was a jab too.
[45:45.79]OK, we're good.
[45:46.65]They're not coming from here anymore.
[45:50.15]OK, mine are getting through.
[45:53.01]They actually.
[45:54.77]It's a little bit.
[46:00.68]Sword is the worst weapon in the game.
[46:01.82]What are you talking about?
[46:04.52]But there's a sword.
[46:05.32]That's what I told you.
[46:06.56]I was upgrading it.
[46:07.12]I want a sword.
[46:08.82]Look.
[46:19.11]Let's do this thing.
[46:20.71]Yeah, it's a I got three upgrades in it.
[46:25.62]I like it.
[46:28.18]Remember, this is a spear.
[46:31.73]It's kind of both, isn't it?
[46:33.71]Maybe it is a spear.
[46:34.37]You're right.
[46:41.72]It's a glaive.
[46:42.72]Yeah.
[46:46.50]Did you press G?
[46:47.86]I did.
[46:48.16]I wasn't.
[46:48.66]I was adjusting my settings.
[46:53.91]Webcam better not be bigger than mine.
[47:03.32]Wow.
[47:04.44]That is a lot of drop.
[47:06.72]This is pretty fun.
[47:24.31]This is just the beginning.
[47:25.51]This is just baby mode.
[47:29.98]I was very, very confused, and you tried to explain this to me before we started.
[47:34.42]So they did Orcs Must Die 1 and 2, and then they made a shitload of other games that were not Orcs Must Die 1.
[47:43.51]We played one of them together once.
[47:45.17]I can't remember what it was actually called.
[47:47.35]It was like Orcs Must Die Forever.
[47:50.91]And it was a mobile game.
[47:52.75]And it was meant to be a live service forever.
[47:57.53]And it was not good.
[47:59.57]And then I think they tried something like that again.
[48:01.49]But Orcs Must Die 2 was a great game.
[48:06.83]So we were excited.
[48:07.61]The first couple were good, yeah.
[48:08.86]Might remember.
[48:12.38]Looks like you need some help over here.
[48:14.78]Oh, sick!
[48:18.22]Is that the Blade of Unrelenting?
[48:26.43]Wow.
[48:28.31]That's the strongest weapon in the game.
[48:30.19]The game was a Stadia exclusive for a while.
[48:33.25]Oh, that too.
[48:33.99]That too, yeah.
[48:36.24]What?
[48:39.10]I'm remembering that.
[48:46.87]The Stadia.
[48:49.15]It's just, it's so wild how, just how fast that came out and how fast it went away.
[48:54.33]Yeah.
[48:54.49]Did you own a stadia?
[48:57.62]No.
[48:58.50]I mean, stadia came out.
[49:00.28]It's called Xbox game pass and it's awesome.
[49:02.32]Like that's like the actual stadia in my opinion.
[49:07.66]Play it.
[49:07.94]You can play shit on the cloud.
[49:09.37]It's just to me that that's where it evolved into.
[49:15.47]Oh, can you tell me more?
[49:18.12]I know it's like a meme that I talk about Xbox Game Pass.
[49:21.28]Every time we have played a game together, like the last four times, you've brought it up.
[49:25.84]I know.
[49:26.24]I know.
[49:26.50]And people are like, not this shit again.
[49:27.81]Shut the fuck up.
[49:28.29]I know.
[49:29.13]I know.
[49:29.39]That's why I'm not going to say anything.
[49:33.91]But if I were to say anything, it would... I like this Fortnite dance.
[49:55.90]Five star or five skull.
[49:57.76]Sorry.
[49:58.04]Alright.
[50:04.38]What about some of these other there's the tar trap.
[50:07.21]There is the gravity pillar.
[50:09.23]There is.
[50:10.75]Oh, I didn't see it.
[50:11.33]You could just unlock.
[50:12.23]You can just like use your skulls to unlock stuff.
[50:15.67]It seems like a lot of things.
[50:17.59]There are a lot of things.
[50:20.07]You're using the broadsword.
[50:22.73]sprays aoe acid fountain damaging enemies and applying acid maybe I think I'm gonna get the acid plate I'm gonna try the wizard staff wait were you using the wizard staff I am using the blade staff okay there's a broadsword broadsword looks pretty cool
[50:52.15]Mom, he got the cool one.
[50:55.11]I did.
[50:58.59]Wait, can I not?
[50:59.33]Oh, it's six.
[51:03.13]That's not fair.
[51:05.68]I think I'm already.
[51:11.72]I'm not.
[51:14.68]He doesn't realize they have this on Roblox.
[51:19.65]Should we just go play Roblox?
[51:22.96]That's not what we're playing today.
[51:24.20]If only the oldest living war mage can open rifts, wouldn't that mean... Yes, Kelsey.
[51:29.66]The oldest is Master Cygnus, if he is still alive.
[51:33.24]But why would Master Cygnus open rifts for orcs to pass through from other worlds?
[51:37.18]If we didn't pick any upgrades?
[51:38.54]I know rifts provide magic, but this magic is not a positive force.
[51:43.09]Alright, so how big is the acid trap?
[51:45.55]I must travel elsewhere for answers.
[51:47.93]So they can only... Can they come from the other side over there?
[51:53.51]On the top middle?
[51:54.57]No.
[51:55.39]So they only can come from here.
[51:57.21]Yeah.
[51:57.59]The mini map shows the one exclamation point at the moment.
[52:00.87]I'm doing... I only have enough to do acid and then I'll maybe slow them down.
[52:09.19]You can do whatever you want.
[52:11.33]I did it.
[52:12.05]I'm ready.
[52:12.35]We want Roblox.
[52:13.67]We want Roblox.
[52:22.94]Can you hold two weapons?
[52:31.00]Do you have like the staff and the gun?
[52:33.42]Yeah, it is treated as if it is just an item slot.
[52:41.02]So you can probably have up to as many as you want.
[52:50.36]You're just slaying!
[52:58.60]You're getting some kills, too.
[53:09.31]I wonder if we can turn up the difficulty, because we are kind of destroying this.
[53:13.95]Yeah.
[53:14.63]Yeah.
[53:15.25]We say that now, but we'll see.
[53:17.79]I was kind of born for this.
[53:26.34]it is Wednesday after all yep oh sparkle on you're letting a few through I was getting another acid spewer
[53:59.35]Let me see your... Did you... Oh, no, you didn't do anything.
[54:04.85]You didn't buy anything, right?
[54:06.05]I didn't... I didn't buy anything.
[54:11.82]You like the strategy here?
[54:14.88]They're coming from the other door now.
[54:16.78]Exclusively the other door.
[54:18.66]Would have been nice for you to say that.
[54:22.90]Like, more than a minute ago.
[54:27.42]More enemies on the way elsewhere Come Come
[54:52.13]You're taking all the kills.
[54:53.39]I'm not going to get any experience.
[54:54.57]I can't buy anything.
[54:55.53]I almost fully upgraded this thing.
[55:00.59]You're unstoppable.
[55:04.22]Well, let's turn it up to hard mode.
[55:14.73]How do they stop you?
[55:17.66]You're getting kills.
[55:19.48]How are you not doing the... Mom!
[55:22.54]I'm getting the hang of this.
[55:23.90]I think they're going to come from both, probably.
[55:29.03]Yeah, both.
[55:30.05]Do you want me to stay over here, or do you want to... I don't know.
[55:34.29]We'll adapt.
[55:34.59]I mean, you are Ster.
[55:35.55]Look at that parkour he just did.
[55:37.76]More enemies on the way!
[55:39.96]Press jump once.
[55:41.12]Oh!
[55:48.16]I'm shooting them from here, dude.
[55:50.80]Nice.
[55:53.56]We're really doing it.
[55:54.32]Oh my god.
[56:01.20]Alright, this right click on this weapon is very good.
[56:08.19]It's incredible.
[56:09.71]Yeah, well you got mana.
[56:12.37]Okay, I think they're just coming from over here now.
[56:19.25]Oh, I missed.
[56:26.56]Am I grenades launching over there correctly?
[56:28.74]Yeah.
[56:36.51]These orcs should go another way.
[56:38.63]That sounded like an angry bird.
[56:45.19]Uh-oh.
[56:46.71]Sir, shoot over here.
[56:48.07]I was kind of tunnel visioned.
[56:52.01]What?
[56:52.67]It's too busy looking at you.
[56:59.45]Maybe we got to stay on easy.
[57:05.51]I thought... Yeah, you told me they were only coming from the other side.
[57:10.29]I lied.
[57:18.20]Yeah.
[57:19.70]I lied.
[57:21.64]That's not very fucking nice.
[57:25.78]Oh my God, you can spam that.
[57:27.48]How'd you enjoy talking to me about playing PoE for a whole week and then not playing?
[57:32.63]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[57:33.71]Hold on a minute.
[57:34.29]Excuse me.
[57:35.47]I hit you up two different times.
[57:38.21]Yeah.
[57:38.73]And you were not available.
[57:40.25]You were not ready.
[57:42.21]That is not true.
[57:46.29]Yes, it is.
[57:51.42]I believe your exact phrasing was, sorry, I haven't slept in three days.
[57:56.06]You said I'll play tomorrow, and I was like, yeah, I'm going to bed.
[58:00.63]I'll see you then.
[58:01.85]But I asked you if you wanted to play over the weekend, and you didn't say anything, and then you said, sorry, I was asleep for three days, or I haven't slept in three days.
[58:09.01]You ghosted me for like a week.
[58:12.80]That's not true.
[58:14.08]Say that again?
[58:14.48]That's simply not true.
[58:16.94]Interesting.
[58:20.22]Interesting.
[58:23.53]And then I asked, I was like, oh man, but like, I want to, it's a complicated game.
[58:27.21]I kind of need some help figuring it out.
[58:29.08]And you said, what was it?
[58:29.78]I believe it was.
[58:30.54]Oh, no, I'm not going to give you that much info.
[58:33.10]Like you'll just like, you'll figure it out.
[58:35.14]You said you were going to play with Holly.
[58:38.58]Yeah.
[58:38.92]We wanted a guide.
[58:39.98]Okay.
[58:44.18]Not fair.
[58:54.12]but honestly though I I do I'm like interested in playing it I I I opened it and I looked at um I looked at like what it was and I I got to I got to the point where you have like skill gems and then I saw the gigantic I got to the gigantic spider web though I just looked at like the spider web of points to put in I was like
[59:20.94]It was something else.
[59:21.90]You got to level two.
[59:23.82]Yep, I was looking for my guide.
[59:25.64]My guide didn't sleep for like a week and ghosted me.
[59:30.40]I've been playing.
[59:31.36]I was there.
[59:32.05]I've been playing.
[59:32.75]I don't know how this is on me.
[59:38.27]This is all you.
[59:39.21]I asked you for help and you said you didn't want to give it to me.
[59:42.11]Actually, I like the acid.
[59:50.38]The acid?
[59:51.72]The acid's pretty good.
[59:57.13]Okay, are we going?
[59:59.03]Are we done?
[59:59.39]Yeah, let's keep going.
[60:02.04]I don't think we can even do the higher difficulty.
[60:05.43]I don't think it's, like, unlocked or anything.
[60:07.31]I think we have to beat, like, the game on the regular difficulty.
[60:10.71]Weren't we allowed to select difficulty before we started?
[60:16.39]Yeah, but I think there's three difficulties, though.
[60:19.77]One, two, three.
[60:20.49]Three was grayed out.
[60:21.33]And we're on two.
[60:21.78]We are on two.
[60:22.90]Okay.
[60:23.12]There are passive things as well.
[60:24.38]This is a passive trinket.
[60:36.48]said I hope Steam goes down again I'm the person up for five minutes okay so we got I am going to get this side situated okay but do you see you see the top mini map now there's like no one coming from this side yet yes but I feel like I'd want to prepare eventually okay you can save your money
[61:06.28]you're a grouchy old man I'm fine okay you didn't have to go there but okay somebody's kind of a cool no I think I'm kind of cool young hip guy with my rollerblades
[61:32.18]Somebody was saying that about me, not you.
[61:33.76]I was responding to that.
[61:35.42]We kind of said it out loud to me.
[61:38.57]You're going to have to watch your tone.
[61:46.09]I'm fragile.
[61:51.11]I think you're pretty strong.
[61:54.39]Wait, so does Holly talk in my chat?
[61:56.07]Because you won't see it?
[61:58.39]That's kind of sad.
[62:01.09]Holly's one of your mods.
[62:04.27]Yeah.
[62:05.45]You modded her.
[62:08.21]And you're not a mod.
[62:09.00]You won't even mod me.
[62:11.76]Yeah, I unmodded literally everybody.
[62:13.70]Like a sacred pact.
[62:15.62]Yeah, I know, but you've... Okay, you know what?
[62:18.34]Don't unmod me on yours.
[62:19.32]I was grandfathered in.
[62:26.04]Yeah, I wouldn't unmod you.
[62:28.26]I trust you.
[62:29.60]Like, if I walk away from my computer, I won't have to mute you.
[62:33.58]Who has a longer sub to the other person?
[62:39.71]Fuck.
[62:40.29]I remember this being a thing.
[62:42.43]Who has a longer sub to the other person?
[62:45.03]Well, to counter that, I am the longest sub to my own channel.
[62:50.32]I have the first subscriber badge to my own channel.
[62:53.02]Yeah, everybody has that.
[62:54.22]No, they don't.
[62:54.80]Type in your chat.
[62:55.36]You don't have it.
[62:57.66]Watch this, guys.
[63:03.15]Waiting.
[63:06.47]Nope, doesn't have it.
[63:07.19]What do you mean, don't have it?
[63:10.64]Mine has a founder.
[63:13.06]a founder like you know, when like someone is the like, it keeps track of the first 50 subs to a channel or I'm, I'm the fifth subscriber to my channel.
[63:21.90]How is that possible?
[63:22.63]Because isn't every streamer just automatically has the sub badge of their own channel?
[63:27.47]Exactly.
[63:28.33]So how does that make any sense?
[63:29.23]What you can't even subscribe to yourself?
[63:30.99]Yeah.
[63:31.25]So what happened?
[63:32.69]I'm, I paid for my own subscription to my own channel for like three years.
[63:38.67]What?
[63:40.52]So I've been subscribed to me longer than you've been subscribed to me.
[63:43.51]So I'm my number one best enemy.
[63:46.75]That's true.
[63:50.89]No, Twitch, you used to not be able to use your own emotes unless you were subscribed to your own channel a long, long, long time ago.
[63:58.00]Way, way, yeah, right when they switched over to Justin.
[64:00.30]So I paid Twitch to let me use my emotes.
[64:04.02]And now it's funny because they added the... Like, you're your own first subscriber badge.
[64:16.93]Oh, the misery.
[64:17.67]Don't trust anyone, not even yourself.
[64:23.65]Honestly?
[64:24.05]Yeah.
[64:26.55]You know how many times I've, like, left reminders for myself and I just fucking forgot about them?
[64:30.09]You know how many times I've said, oh, I need to, like, oh, yeah, I really should, like, put away that fucking spaghetti.
[64:37.28]And I don't do it.
[64:38.14]And I say, I'm going to do it.
[64:39.04]I'm going to trust myself.
[64:48.34]Alright, they're coming from both.
[64:49.90]What a... What a... What a difficult life that must be.
[64:55.28]What?
[64:56.95]I don't even trust myself.
[64:59.49]What?
[65:01.15]To put spaghetti away.
[65:02.95]Well, I gotta put the spaghetti away.
[65:03.99]I'm like, oh, you piece of shit, you're not gonna do it, are you?
[65:07.27]You ate food that sat out for like a week.
[65:10.12]You have no say in this.
[65:13.14]One day, and also it was my wife that left it out.
[65:17.14]So...
[65:19.81]Not me.
[65:21.15]Oh, so now you're deflecting now.
[65:24.56]What do you mean I'm deflecting?
[65:27.56]So now the deflection.
[65:28.76]Every ounce of anguish in my life is her.
[65:35.36]Jesus.
[65:40.70]I think you can handle that.
[65:41.46]I'll stay over here.
[65:44.52]Honestly, it's not going well.
[65:46.16]Really?
[65:46.48]Okay.
[65:47.38]These little runners.
[65:50.23]I don't have a giant cleave sword.
[65:56.08]Watch the right side, though, because they're actually going to probably start going that way in a minute.
[66:00.22]Well, when they do... Oh, there they are!
[66:05.29]Yes, I did have... Yeah, I know someone's going to say that.
[66:07.61]I do have to look down at my keyboard to press 5.
[66:09.31]Alright, stop.
[66:12.48]Somebody was thinking it.
[66:13.88]That's sad.
[66:24.15]So good on the left, yeah.
[66:33.98]Man.
[66:36.08]It'd be pretty sad to be classified as a light horse.
[66:40.88]What like you just like smaller?
[66:42.95]Yeah.
[66:45.35]Like oh shit.
[66:51.14]I thought you were reacting to what would happen if you were classified as a light orc.
[66:56.52]I'm reacting to the light orcs getting past us.
[67:05.58]Alright, next wave coming.
[67:06.52]Next wave.
[67:07.70]Get your head in the game.
[67:09.57]My head's in the game.
[67:10.49]Head's in the game.
[67:14.19]I think we just stay in the middle.
[67:15.91]We should just be staying here.
[67:19.47]That makes a lot of sense.
[67:24.87]I mean, I know this looks like shit, but it's for practicality, not for looks.
[67:28.89]I don't think they walk through here.
[67:30.05]They don't walk to the middle where you're putting the trap.
[67:34.12]Oh.
[67:48.34]Left side is clear.
[68:09.95]I believe it.
[68:20.28]truly epic alright so let me sell all this then because if they're not going to come through here maybe they will eventually or no I just no you can see the path they're taking on oh my goodness you can alright hold on yeah you're trying to you're you're copium I am three of those there
[68:44.36]Yeah, but anyway, Holly was saying that she's extremely sad that you didn't play PoE.
[68:51.36]She's really looking forward to it.
[68:53.71]I was too.
[68:56.27]And it's kind of messed up.
[69:00.65]Maybe don't ghost me.
[69:01.75]Maybe don't ghost me for like five days.
[69:06.36]Okay.
[69:14.49]It's totally okay for you to do a Roblox birthday party when we had prior plans.
[69:22.41]Again, I just want to make this really clear.
[69:28.42]I'm sorry, but somebody's birthday party is going to take priority.
[69:33.84]That's a little selfish of you, don't you think?
[69:37.22]Who?
[69:37.86]Whose birthday was it, are you asking?
[69:39.12]Whose birthday was it?
[69:39.94]Yes.
[69:40.92]Oh.
[69:41.52]Local eClown.
[69:43.18]It was their birthday.
[69:45.06]Oh, just pushed that right back at you, didn't I?
[69:51.01]Which mod just, like, told you that?
[69:52.43]Nope.
[69:52.83]There was not enough time.
[69:53.85]You know about stream delay.
[69:55.25]There wasn't enough time.
[69:55.97]Aren't you on, like, Quantum?
[70:00.01]You're not on Quantum yet?
[70:00.79]Nope.
[70:04.57]I switched to Quantum.
[70:05.60]My mods are responding to things that I haven't even done yet.
[70:07.76]They're like, dude, no, no, no, don't say that.
[70:09.34]That's too much.
[70:11.54]They caught me a couple times already in the stream where, like, I was gonna... I'm sorry.
[70:16.43]That thing happened where I'm just not hearing anything.
[70:18.91]What happened?
[70:23.11]I'm sorry.
[70:23.67]It happens a lot.
[70:24.35]But, like, you...
[70:32.09]I'm sorry.
[70:33.63]No, it's not.
[70:34.75]It's, uh, no problem.
[70:37.19]What's the best class in PoE?
[70:43.25]Um, best for what?
[70:46.46]I don't know.
[70:46.84]Room clear.
[70:52.56]I don't know.
[71:01.56]I don't know, man.
[71:02.40]What do you play in PoE?
[71:04.00]Can you even answer that?
[71:04.90]There's like 5,000 classes in PoE, isn't there?
[71:09.04]um there are actually there's nine ascendancies yeah or nine classes or dude I don't know there's a lot um they're all good at different stuff I think which is probably still the most played is poe 2 when is it coming out uh exile con which is gonna announce poe 2 stuff is the end of July
[71:38.14]is it worth waiting for that or is it better just to play like I mean I kind of I'm like I want to play it my take would have been wait but like if you're really interested it's I think poe 2 is going to be different enough that you'll be able to like
[71:53.45]You'll get like two different play experiences of playing now and playing later.
[71:56.73]You're not really going to like miss.
[71:59.81]Yeah.
[72:00.91]Or I don't know.
[72:04.10]I don't know how to phrase it.
[72:05.96]They're different enough.
[72:08.12]It's not an Overwatch 2 situation where it's not going to be any different at all.
[72:13.56]There's slated a lot of changes.
[72:16.50]And it's a whole completely different campaign.
[72:18.10]So if you played through this campaign, it would be very different if you played PoE 2 later.
[72:23.62]Yes, I'll play it then.
[72:25.24]I'll still play it.
[72:30.50]Oh my God, he remembered?
[72:31.53]Yeah, I did.
[72:33.13]I remembered your birthday.
[72:35.89]When's my birthday?
[72:38.60]August, I don't know.
[72:45.56]oh yeah okay alright so there we are hold on so there we are you can't say that you cannot fight me on this one I'm not like googling my hands are up cops you got me I'm gonna I'm just gonna throw a guess out but I'm gonna think for a second because you would have done like a like drama drama stream a birthday-a-thon and I'm just thinking if there was one I'm gonna say may 4th not even in the right season okay
[73:16.95]Oh, man, you were.
[73:18.91]Oh, no.
[73:19.33]You were coming at me.
[73:21.03]That's Star Wars.
[73:22.49]What?
[73:22.61]That's not you.
[73:23.65]May the 4th be with you.
[73:24.37]That's Star Wars Day.
[73:26.07]Yeah.
[73:26.91]All I'm saying, but if you're going to come at me with that kind of a, hey, when's my birthday?
[73:32.03]Then you better know my birthday.
[73:33.65]You know what I mean?
[73:34.31]You better know mine.
[73:38.07]September?
[73:38.59]Oh, I wonder if you were reading a chat room.
[73:42.99]No, I'm remembering.
[73:44.03]I'm remembering.
[73:46.69]Our long lasting friendship and all of the birthdays that we shared together.
[73:52.50]May 4th.
[73:53.74]May the 4th be with you.
[73:55.46]That's so funny.
[73:56.54]Alright, what do you upgrade?
[74:00.42]I don't know.
[74:01.44]Alchemist satchel.
[74:02.38]I thought I upgraded.
[74:03.40]I didn't have it with me.
[74:05.12]So you got to like equip weapon differently.
[74:07.20]Yeah, you just put it on your loadout.
[74:10.98]Where do you modify the loadout?
[74:13.50]In the game.
[74:14.00]Like when we're actually in the game.
[74:15.02]It's B. Oh, okay.
[74:18.37]Well, I'm ready.
[74:20.63]I think.
[74:23.33]Yeah, you can do your loadout before we get the first wave.
[74:28.19]Okay, then I'm
[74:34.90]What's this title?
[74:36.46]That's pretty bad.
[74:37.22]Block path.
[74:37.60]Oh, we can change their route.
[74:39.20]With that new thing we got.
[74:58.63]I'm going to leave that up to you because I... There's like math involved with that and game mechanics and game awareness.
[75:05.72]I'm going to leave that up to you.
[75:06.52]Yeah, there's like math.
[75:12.63]Okay.
[75:13.69]I'll be the blocker.
[75:15.59]Alright, so how do you want to handle this?
[75:17.51]Do you want to block everybody from like this way so they have to go up this staircase?
[75:23.62]I feel like that's a good idea.
[75:25.28]I think we can just block the stairs and then yeah, then they go to the other stairs.
[75:31.21]Okay, so they can't like walk around here, are you?
[75:35.58]Then we'll just focus on one stair.
[75:37.92]Yeah, so then we just focus on the stairs.
[75:40.86]And I'm going to go like this.
[75:42.49]I'm going to save my money.
[75:45.07]And then... Oh, we got a teleporter.
[75:48.45]There is a teleporter.
[75:49.21]Where does it go?
[75:50.37]It goes all the way to where we're defending.
[75:52.75]The top of the stairs.
[75:57.36]That was a big staircase.
[75:58.98]It's pretty big.
[75:59.60]But I think if we can keep people funneled this way, we should be fine.
[76:04.40]uh what'd you do for your last birthday um okay if you don't even remember how am I supposed to remember when your birthday is I feel like I was like really busy during that period like there's like just a lot going on yeah it sounds like I get a pass I didn't uh
[76:27.79]You know, I didn't get a message from anybody on it, though.
[76:32.21]From what I remember.
[76:35.25]It's okay.
[76:36.51]Sometimes we forget each other's... You know, that's alright.
[76:41.92]Let's just play.
[76:42.36]Yeah, that's fine.
[76:46.96]Let's go.
[76:48.11]Yeah, I'm good.
[76:54.86]open okay I'm throwing these green potions don't drink any
[77:24.14]oh I've been stunned I've been I've been stunned I was dead yeah they don't even have to like swing if they just walk on you you get stunned I don't like that charge I'm gonna die can I revive you I don't know I just auto revived here this is all your fault
[77:54.62]What is this difficulty curve?
[77:57.60]Hey, they taught us how to play, and now they're giving us the real deal.
[78:01.95]Okay.
[78:04.35]The leash is off, as they say.
[78:06.41]Okay, so they obviously are going a little too fast.
[78:10.59]So, I mean, I'm gonna... Yeah, we should do some slowdown.
[78:14.75]Followed by more poison.
[78:17.62]Followed by... I think that's alright.
[78:22.06]We just need to stay in one spot.
[78:24.50]But we need to make sure they're bullied at the door.
[78:26.90]Okay.
[78:27.26]We're ready.
[78:29.08]You know what?
[78:29.98]Here.
[78:31.46]Might as well.
[78:34.33]Alright.
[78:34.77]Let's do it.
[78:35.89]Okay.
[78:36.71]I think it's going to be a lot of big.
[78:46.25]Ready.
[78:47.57]And...
[78:57.57]I'm killing them.
[79:05.72]I'm killing them.
[79:08.20]Wait, what?
[79:09.46]How'd they get in?
[79:10.72]These little runners just don't care.
[79:13.40]Nobody got by me.
[79:28.99]How do you regenerate mana just over time?
[79:30.81]I think it just does.
[79:31.55]Oh, shit.
[79:43.95]There's mana potions that kind of lie around, healing potions.
[79:46.43]I wonder, do they spawn randomly?
[79:49.09]I wonder.
[79:50.09]I don't know.
[79:52.35]I think probably random when you kill things.
[79:55.51]Alright.
[79:56.41]Alright.
[80:07.45]Fuck, I love streaming.
[80:09.17]Okay.
[80:15.08]Do I have to... Wait a minute.
[80:18.10]Do you have to have the artifacts out for it to heal you?
[80:21.04]Or is it just... I think it has a passive effect and you can use it and it will heal.
[80:25.56]Really?
[80:26.03]Okay, that's good to know.
[80:28.93]Ooh, that's a good idea.
[80:30.01]I'm going to put this one here.
[80:37.33]But then they have to walk that way.
[80:40.21]I would sell that.
[80:41.44]Yeah.
[80:42.44]Here, I got you.
[80:43.72]Okay.
[80:45.14]Why?
[80:47.30]Don't we want them to be coming down like a really narrow?
[80:50.14]Which orc is walking into this corner?
[80:54.06]When enough of them come up here.
[80:55.63]Do you see the ghost walking by?
[80:57.19]Yeah, but when there's enough of them walking, they're going to hit collision.
[81:00.35]They're going to have to spread out.
[81:02.53]And we want them in a narrow, narrow place.
[81:07.31]That's as narrow as it's going to be.
[81:08.41]All I'm saying is if like a dozen orcs walk this way, then you owe me $1,000.
[81:11.85]Okay.
[81:12.07]Well, I'm just saying that the barricade is like the most expensive thing we can build right now.
[81:17.17]Okay.
[81:18.23]And you put it in the corner.
[81:22.35]Runner!
[81:24.06]We got to kill these little gobos.
[81:26.30]Yeah.
[81:28.16]Watch out, big guy.
[81:34.32]No.
[81:47.86]You owe me $1,000.
[81:48.20]Wait, one guy behind me.
[81:51.76]Wait, why do I... Space, I did a U and I didn't listen to anything that you said.
[81:55.83]You owe me $1,000.
[81:56.95]Why?
[81:57.39]Because somebody went... They were walking off the traps to the right.
[82:00.29]I'm not feeling so good.
[82:04.45]Okay, was that a problem?
[82:05.65]Like such a problem that we lost?
[82:08.20]Tell me.
[82:16.96]Dude, it's been like an hour and a half into the stream and you haven't, we haven't brought up like a food topic.
[82:22.61]What's going on here?
[82:24.09]A food, a food.
[82:25.95]Um, do you want to, I don't know what's like, you talk a lot about sauces.
[82:29.27]What's a, what's a good sauce?
[82:30.53]What's your favorite sauce right now?
[82:31.69]Blue cheese.
[82:32.36]Bingo.
[82:33.38]Blue cheese sauce.
[82:35.02]Yeah.
[82:35.88]I would classify it as a sauce.
[82:38.94]Not as a cheese.
[82:40.40]Well, like blue cheese sauce.
[82:42.26]Like it's blue cheese, but it's also part of like that base, right?
[82:45.37]What's, what's the base?
[82:47.41]um I actually don't really know what is like in the blue cheese sauce because blue cheese is obviously like blue cheese crumbles but what is it what is it what's the base of it is it ranch I don't know if it's if it's ranch every time is this milk oh so you're allowed to talk about milk okay kind of weird
[83:21.38]You know what I'll tell you?
[83:24.71]There might be doubters in the chat and that's alright.
[83:26.87]You might be one yourself after I say this.
[83:30.64]But a thin crust pepperoni pizza with Tabasco sauce, just like a pool of it, like a little pool of it on the side and a pool of blue cheese on the side.
[83:40.68]And you just smear that shit all over it and take a bite.
[83:44.64]It's going to change your entire life.
[83:46.86]And I know people like it.
[83:48.67]I know that you haven't seen the light yet.
[83:52.76]And the light, it was blue cheese with Tabasco sauce.
[83:56.20]It has to be specifically... Hold on.
[84:02.66]We're going to lose.
[84:09.98]Where's our limit of how many people can go in before we lose?
[84:14.16]It's tough.
[84:15.54]10.
[84:15.86]It starts at 20.
[84:22.49]Alright, I got a lot of money, so let's make sure we get this right.
[84:27.15]Let's slow him down.
[84:31.71]I agree.
[84:32.47]I want them to be slugs coming in here.
[84:35.13]Here, here, come up here.
[84:37.87]Eat buffalo wings?
[84:38.69]No, no, no.
[84:39.57]Oh, do you have money left?
[84:40.32]I do.
[84:41.78]If we did like a tar pits all the way around this whole corner.
[84:49.10]That's all I have.
[84:53.08]okay that's all I got so um so yeah you were talking about dipping a sauce in a sauce no no no what it sounded like for a slice of pepperoni pizza and you get a little bit of tabasco on it and then you dunk that into the blue cheese like sauce there are not go on pizza yes of course
[85:18.27]I know, question, I know, question mark, question mark, but one day you're gonna do it.
[85:21.99]It's because, like, oh, that fucking weirdo, that, like, e-clown, like, moron that I watched last night.
[85:28.63]And then your eyes are gonna go, and you're gonna go, what happened?
[85:31.64]How did I not know about this?
[85:41.52]And then you will be, officially, a pepperoni pizza blue cheese Tabasco decidedly.
[85:48.80]It sounds stupider now that I understand the whole combo.
[85:53.17]All those words just don't go together.
[85:56.35]What?
[85:56.73]Jerma's been having ChatGBT make his food.
[86:07.48]Come on, man.
[86:12.93]This was a good idea.
[86:13.67]Okay.
[86:16.54]I'm just telling you one day someone's gonna try it and they're gonna just like the tuna fish and pretzels and everyone's like oh my god dude you what what wait what I haven't heard of this is this all is this the thing I'm unaware of some of you guys just really need to see the light and you just won't and that's fine more for me oh if you jump while you're in the air you do a thing maybe that's just a bow thing that I didn't know oh you can like float yeah you do like a ground pound
[86:46.62]Are we just going?
[86:47.19]I think we are just... I guess so.
[86:50.21]I wasn't ready.
[86:50.77]Let's get that same concept over here.
[87:08.67]There's some enzyme.
[87:10.47]I don't know what it is.
[87:11.35]It's something to do with the enzymes of this food.
[87:15.59]But like a pretzel stick into a fresh thing of good tuna, like solid albacore tuna.
[87:24.17]It's just something about it.
[87:25.29]The same thing with the blue cheese, Tabasco and pizza.
[87:35.19]There's some sort of enzyme that validates your bad taste.
[87:39.75]No.
[87:40.77]I'm going to make this for you.
[87:43.38]I saw you licking your lips to the dog food the other day.
[87:51.66]That was a joke, though.
[87:52.86]We're talking about a piece of comedic work.
[88:03.29]So like laughing at the cars was awful a bit.
[88:05.47]They're attacking a barricade.
[88:09.44]I don't actually think cars are funny.
[88:12.24]No, I do.
[88:13.84]Okay.
[88:15.03]Making sure we're not like.
[88:17.29]I think that heals you too, by the way.
[88:19.47]Yeah.
[88:25.68]Oh, I got a stun.
[88:27.02]That's good to know.
[88:28.67]Yeah, but you can't give me shit for the car thing.
[88:31.47]When back in the old days of YouTube, you were like the king of the car go fast into like a wall joke.
[88:39.37]I think cars are funny.
[88:40.53]Oh, okay.
[88:41.85]So you weren't... I was just bringing it up because you felt like really self-conscious about... Oh, no, then we're on the same page then.
[88:48.26]I have some complex feelings that I think cars are both funny and also I hate all cars and I wish I could destroy them all.
[89:00.39]I'm getting this giant flip trap.
[89:05.81]Ooh, mega boom barrel launcher.
[89:13.92]That's kind of cool.
[89:19.29]I can't upgrade them.
[89:27.28]Can I fully upgrade the acid duration?
[89:31.76]What's the difference here?
[89:32.70]Increase duration or increase melting duration?
[89:35.82]What does that mean?
[89:37.93]I don't know what the difference is.
[89:49.27]I feel like this is the actual damage and this is how long it sprays for.
[89:52.38]Yeah, I'll do that.
[90:01.38]okay I'm good I'm just gonna keep shooting my bow there's also I think there's a refund all your upgrades it looks like it's some dumb choices I'm doing it what are you doing oh no we skipped we okay never mind I was gonna refund all my upgrades and we got oh hey hold on lore lore boss
[90:42.59]Oh, Master Cygnus taught my hero Maximilian.
[90:47.43]Uh, yes, he tried to teach your hero.
[90:51.06]He was my teacher as well.
[90:52.66]Didn't you turn evil for- Don't test me!
[90:55.20]Sorry, sorceress.
[90:56.84]What is not known is the story of his best friend, the elf Vorwick.
[91:02.70]Human and elf fought side by side, the most talented war mages of the Order.
[91:08.80]Before infighting forced the horde into small factions, they used massive traps and defeated the largest.
[91:15.93]You watching this?
[91:18.19]Cygnus and Vorwick were the best young war mages of their generation.
[91:22.59]But when their final test came, only one of them would pass.
[91:28.05]Are we getting new characters?
[91:34.09]Maybe.
[91:34.65]I know you're going to want to be the elf man, right?
[91:37.78]I like elves.
[91:39.36]In the same way that I like cars, that I think they're funny and stupid and they shouldn't exist.
[91:48.48]Cane, lightning staff, or short swords?
[91:51.27]I don't think we're probably not going to have a choice.
[91:53.43]It's going to just give us either one.
[92:03.77]Oh, we're in nostalgia vision.
[92:04.89]Oh, I was going to say, that would be so funny.
[92:06.13]10,000.
[92:06.15]We need to think about this.
[92:06.97]They're giving us 10,000.
[92:07.81]Oh, well, you can equip the legendary stuff now.
[92:10.00]Right?
[92:10.20]It's not letting me drag them on.
[92:27.01]nonetheless you probably need to yeah you have to like match for my strength oh they require two slots knowledge of rift magic is that what is that large amounts of enemies maybe it is two slots it says war scenarios only which this is oh they're like ultimate shift one and shift two you always have them oh okay I guess well let's what where are they coming from
[92:53.68]They come from here.
[92:54.28]We should probably do a block scenario.
[92:59.46]What's the most efficient way to block this?
[93:05.78]Just kind of go from here across?
[93:09.26]Or from like here to like here?
[93:19.98]Or just wait till they get up to the stairs.
[93:24.16]Didn't just fight?
[93:24.64]Yeah, fight on the bridge.
[93:27.24]I guess we could make them just go... Yeah, let's fight on the bridge.
[93:29.40]Do you want to funnel them through just one little zone on the bridge?
[93:32.51]Like, block a couple of zones here?
[93:39.41]I don't know, man.
[93:42.45]It seems like a smart ideaberger.
[93:45.87]I'll do it.
[93:46.55]Very good.
[93:47.63]So they have to walk through here.
[93:49.46]Here?
[93:49.72]Okay.
[93:50.62]So then I'm going to get them with the poison.
[93:53.60]Boom right here.
[93:55.04]Here's where they will blow.
[93:58.18]I fucked it up.
[93:58.80]It's whatever.
[94:00.92]Oh.
[94:03.36]I see.
[94:03.84]An excellent location.
[94:06.98]OK, so they're going to have to cross through there.
[94:08.88]And then they have to cross through here.
[94:14.94]Go like this.
[94:16.58]No better spot than here.
[94:18.02]OK.
[94:22.90]This is an Omega launcher, right?
[94:25.16]Yeah.
[94:25.84]Just send him into the lava.
[94:28.52]Should I put one of these down too on the other side?
[94:30.74]Do you move this back a little?
[94:32.10]And I'll put one going the other direction?
[94:35.02]Can you move things?
[94:36.32]Do you sell stuff at full value?
[94:38.22]Why do I gotta move mineberger?
[94:38.98]Why do I gotta move mine?
[94:40.57]Because we should put another one right here.
[94:41.65]Right?
[94:43.25]Because they'll go like... This is just... I think this is in the way.
[94:49.15]I think this is the only place we're gonna be able to put one of these like...
[94:53.02]lobbers because I don't I don't know like I well I wonder if we need to put I'm selling your things why are you selling my stuff I'm snaking them oh you're doing like the tower defense strat okay
[95:21.16]We should just do that again.
[95:22.20]Just pull this thing back.
[95:23.78]Let's just make him do another snake.
[95:28.80]Then we'll go like this, right?
[95:29.94]Right here.
[95:34.70]That's all I can afford right now.
[95:36.48]Okay.
[95:37.43]Yeah, I'm out of money.
[95:38.01]Alright.
[95:38.73]Let's go for it.
[95:44.14]Okay.
[95:45.58]That was weird.
[95:46.08]I just did a full front flip and landed right on my back and knocked the wind out of myself.
[95:51.68]Waiting for a player.
[95:52.66]I think it's a heal.
[95:54.46]Um, I fell.
[95:56.42]What do you mean?
[96:03.32]Ow.
[96:04.34]What did you do?
[96:05.33]Oh, you're good.
[96:15.63]I'm coming.
[96:19.53]Wait, you fell too?
[96:20.73]You jumped in?
[96:22.05]You couldn't resist because someone fell and you had to fall in?
[96:26.15]But mine was cooler than yours because I did a front flip.
[96:38.30]The barricade is under attack!
[96:44.07]Dude, this is like hell deep!
[96:48.45]Right?
[96:49.87]What does a right click on this even do?
[97:02.82]They can actually shoot at us.
[97:04.40]I'm dying.
[97:05.94]We'll pull back.
[97:06.58]Look at all this time we got.
[97:08.12]I got you.
[97:11.76]I got you.
[97:23.16]It's okay.
[97:23.42]We both did that.
[97:24.84]Alright.
[97:26.70]Watch out.
[97:27.26]Big thumper coming through.
[97:28.58]I want to see him go off.
[97:32.00]I want to see him go.
[97:33.36]After it happens, laugh like really hard.
[97:35.28]Okay.
[97:42.04]That's the thumbnail.
[97:44.08]Why did it not launch it?
[97:46.40]It launched one of them.
[97:47.60]Like a little guy.
[97:48.28]It did?
[97:48.84]Yeah.
[97:50.36]I didn't see that.
[97:53.20]okay well we got some orcs to kill can you react I didn't see anything it's not happening on my screen uh they're they've they they have reached where are you they're in the back here they're getting through did you see it that time this one got lost
[98:21.65]Am I the only one being a tuber?
[98:23.71]Did I evade it?
[98:24.87]I'm trying to not lose.
[98:25.79]They're getting through.
[98:28.63]Do something about it.
[98:29.41]Uh-oh.
[98:35.92]Heavy orcs.
[98:40.16]This kind of reminds me of playing Dynasty Warriors.
[98:47.47]One time I was playing Dynasty Warriors and just running around just going like this.
[98:51.33]And I think I'm pretty sure I fell asleep doing it and I was still pressing the button.
[98:58.59]Target demographic right there.
[98:59.93]And I woke up.
[99:02.92]And it wasn't that long.
[99:04.42]Probably was like maybe five seconds, ten seconds.
[99:07.68]Pops.
[99:08.62]Oh, these are traps up here.
[99:10.40]You can pour them.
[99:14.14]I loved that game.
[99:15.16]That game was so fun.
[99:16.42]Especially the first few.
[99:18.42]I've never actually played one.
[99:20.02]Really?
[99:21.18]Yeah.
[99:22.64]The first two or three were awesome.
[99:26.30]Especially like, yeah, the first like five.
[99:29.11]Which one was the best one?
[99:29.85]What was the best one?
[99:31.03]Yeah, it was one of the early ones.
[99:33.93]Are we keeping the same strategy going?
[99:36.39]We got more money.
[99:39.02]Have you even seen this catapult shoot?
[99:42.12]Do we need to do it?
[99:43.76]I haven't seen it happen.
[99:46.26]I think we might need to tell it to fire.
[99:49.42]I'm selling your stuff because... Why did you not make it flush?
[99:58.83]What?
[99:59.65]I sold your two things.
[100:00.69]You didn't make it flush.
[100:02.67]I didn't flush.
[100:03.33]It was an inefficient use.
[100:07.14]Oh, okay.
[100:07.90]I built them in a panic.
[100:12.25]I can hop in this and use this thing.
[100:19.57]I almost feel like we should sell the launcher and just make a longer S. Yeah, honestly, I feel like that thing is not helping us that much.
[100:26.84]Have you used this thing?
[100:27.86]The one that I'm in this big, like, cannon thing?
[100:30.24]No.
[100:31.04]Don't sell my cannon.
[100:31.78]I want it.
[100:32.56]Oh, that's what I mean.
[100:33.58]You can sit in it.
[100:34.27]Okay, I haven't used it once.
[100:36.73]The launcher is strong.
[100:38.21]How can we... Why are we not doing it right?
[100:41.09]I don't know.
[100:42.47]I think it's like a U problem.
[100:44.69]He's being such an affliction warlock right now.
[100:49.34]Me or who?
[100:50.68]I don't know.
[100:51.12]I just read it.
[100:53.83]What does that mean?
[100:54.61]I don't know.
[100:58.01]Can you catapult them from there?
[100:59.23]I can.
[100:59.73]Take a look.
[101:01.75]Watch this.
[101:03.88]Oh, whoa, dude.
[101:06.48]This is just like Helm's Deep.
[101:07.84]What a view you got.
[101:09.18]What a view you got.
[101:13.00]Alright, these things are actually amazing.
[101:14.82]That's going to mentally scar me for years.
[101:17.04]Definitely should make more of these.
[101:18.38]Because we could just sit back and do this.
[101:19.90]Alright, big guy coming in.
[101:44.60]I hope this doesn't hurt our stuff.
[101:46.77]Let's find out.
[101:48.91]Does that like hurt?
[101:49.69]Am I hurting like the... It doesn't look like it did.
[101:52.25]Okay, because this does a crazy amount of damage.
[101:59.24]Honestly, we should just put two of these side by side and just hang out.
[102:01.26]Alright, bet.
[102:08.13]OK, well, do you got the money for one?
[102:09.35]Uh, not yet.
[102:12.76]We will soon.
[102:14.58]Yeah, you're cheating.
[102:20.84]Oh, starting to get through.
[102:31.29]Is that an ultimate or something you're doing?
[102:32.77]Oh, that was the right click of the staff.
[102:35.68]Hauls down a bunch of beams.
[102:40.36]It does use some mana.
[102:44.20]Oh, those things cost 3,000.
[102:44.92]I'm on it.
[102:46.32]I'm getting through.
[102:48.68]I'm on it, boss.
[103:09.03]I have enough money to make another one.
[103:10.53]I'm going to get out and I'm going to make you one.
[103:15.51]OK.
[103:15.67]Alright, get in.
[103:26.87]You good?
[103:28.17]I'm dealing with these ogres.
[103:29.41]I'm good.
[103:31.12]Focus on yourself for once.
[103:34.26]God.
[103:36.38]Is it too close?
[103:40.11]I think it's a good spot.
[103:41.96]Well, I still have.
[103:42.90]Let me do this.
[103:47.32]Too close.
[103:52.37]Should I put it back like here?
[103:55.73]But he can't.
[103:56.19]He won't be able to see there's there's a whole other platform back on the other side where we can like kill all the guys in the beginning.
[104:03.77]You know what I mean?
[104:04.33]We should put the big launcher then.
[104:06.45]Put it over here.
[104:06.99]Put it over here.
[104:07.67]Put it over here.
[104:09.97]Put it over here.
[104:11.27]Because we should just be double teaming with these.
[104:14.50]Yeah, I'll double team with you anytime.
[104:16.24]Let's fucking go.
[104:16.88]Put it here.
[104:20.42]I got to make sure it's the right way.
[104:21.74]Put it.
[104:24.66]It has to be like here.
[104:26.56]Because it won't.
[104:27.12]I can't aim in the right direction.
[104:28.63]Do you want this one or do you want the one on the bridge?
[104:30.31]I want this one.
[104:30.83]Alright.
[104:33.17]Let's go.
[104:33.61]I'm ready.
[104:34.75]What's your highest score in Papa's Freezeria?
[104:38.13]In Papa's Freezeria?
[104:42.20]What?
[104:43.98]Did I not speak clearly?
[104:50.66]What?
[104:52.64]Pay attention.
[104:53.10]We have to get the Orcs.
[104:55.93]I'm paying attention.
[105:03.96]How many people can play this at the same time?
[105:05.30]I think 64.
[105:07.10]It's no fair.
[105:12.31]You can actually hit them from there.
[105:29.63]It's almost time to put your attention onto the bridge.
[105:33.46]Wait, one of them got knocked all the way up here to me.
[105:39.26]It's time to focus on the bridge.
[105:40.12]We got five big guys about to come through.
[105:44.87]Okay.
[105:51.24]How are they getting up here?
[105:52.22]I don't know.
[105:54.66]Are they getting launched here by the other launcher?
[105:57.62]Little, little, uh oh.
[105:59.99]I got him.
[106:00.49]Oh, you're good.
[106:06.83]Yeah, they are getting launched.
[106:09.09]Dude, that thing I think is launching them.
[106:11.17]The thing behind us.
[106:12.37]Yeah, it's launching them the whole way.
[106:14.43]I'm going to go sell it.
[106:19.75]I can't sell it.
[106:22.89]Whoever built that's a moron.
[106:24.57]They're overwhelming us.
[106:26.33]Nice.
[106:42.99]enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates where's the fan art oh it's the title where's the thunder
[107:13.31]You know what I'm talking about?
[107:14.33]Big guy.
[107:16.19]I need you to focus up.
[107:17.23]We got five big guys coming in.
[107:18.87]Focus up.
[107:22.99]Coming.
[107:23.47]I'm coming to help.
[107:35.82]Ow.
[107:39.00]Ow.
[107:39.34]Ow.
[107:39.89]Ow.
[107:42.24]stop dude I'm gaming I have never reached this level what's your favorite game dude we've had this conversation and we just agree every time isn't that boring it's like Diablo II Bloodborne but actually it's path of exile
[108:11.60]Name me your top 10 games that you think are your favorites.
[108:15.22]That's too hard.
[108:17.26]I'm going to be thinking for like hours before I say some stupid shit that I'm going to regret that everyone's going to quote me for years because I said this one time on this drama stream that I said like that My Little Pony Ponies Are Forever is like my favorite.
[108:30.20]Can you slowly tell me about what you had for breakfast this morning?
[108:34.50]Slowly.
[108:35.04]Like, very slow.
[108:36.16]I had a leftover Jersey Mike sandwich with some milk.
[109:02.16]alright perfection wait you wait you drank you just you had a a sub with milk you shut the up wait wait wait wait but what about my eating habits oh dude blue cheese is gross man you I'm gonna drink milk with a sub it was muscle milk
[109:27.63]So I think that gives it a pass.
[109:29.51]Yeah, I guess so.
[109:31.03]Perhaps one of these.
[109:32.08]Why don't I just do that?
[109:35.40]Alright, we need to figure out... They're going to breach this, so... Do we want them going around here, like through here?
[109:44.54]No, no, no, do that!
[109:45.91]Look, because you can pour these.
[109:49.05]Okay, well, then we want it over here.
[109:51.43]No, because there's one on each side.
[109:54.42]Okay, well, then we don't need it.
[109:55.82]And then we need to figure out what to do after they get through that.
[109:58.00]Oh, my God.
[109:58.70]Then maybe we should put some tar down there.
[110:00.94]Maybe we should go like this so we can start the snake again.
[110:05.31]Ah!
[110:06.81]This should work.
[110:09.09]Is that... Are you okay with that?
[110:10.39]So then they have to snake through here?
[110:11.41]I'm fine with that.
[110:11.95]Alright.
[110:14.87]You ready?
[110:15.53]Get in your launcher.
[110:32.03]When we're hitting these guys, are we getting like a Hellwork Packard logo?
[110:36.11]Like, what is this?
[110:37.84]I honestly don't even know what words you just said.
[110:42.74]A what logo?
[110:46.90]They make like printers and... Hewlett Packard.
[110:50.30]Something like that.
[110:50.94]Yeah, Hewlett Packard.
[110:51.90]What did you say?
[110:52.58]I don't know.
[110:56.50]Hellwort?
[110:58.22]What did you say?
[111:00.74]Hellwort Packard?
[111:02.58]Hellwort.
[111:03.17]I don't even know what I'm... Are you shooting your bombs?
[111:08.75]I am.
[111:09.31]I'm focusing on the bridge.
[111:12.85]That didn't even hurt anybody.
[111:13.79]What?
[111:14.21]Okay, well, there's a lot of guys on the bridge.
[111:15.72]Oh, goodness.
[111:19.96]Oh, my goodness.
[111:21.68]It's under control.
[111:22.36]It's under control.
[111:27.31]One little guy getting through.
[111:28.05]Nothing I can do about it.
[111:35.32]How do I do this?
[111:42.06]How do I do this?
[111:55.01]hair in my mouth dude did we get do we get like an end of the game scorecard I don't know we get to compare each other and see who is more valuable
[112:16.89]uh possible general electric logo is that what it is that looks more like the
[112:52.09]Don't worry, I've got you.
[112:53.29]I'm clicking left click.
[113:06.75]Now.
[113:10.24]Who launched one off nice?
[113:14.30]We were lucky this time.
[113:15.94]Alright, this is the last wave.
[113:22.98]All the orcs sound like Bugleberry.
[113:34.25]This is too big, you can't put anything down, so I guess we're just gonna do this.
[113:43.98]An excellent location.
[113:47.13]I think I'm going to upgrade the slow trap thing.
[113:50.85]I feel like it's really useful, and with any points in it, it would be way better.
[113:55.88]I'm liking the slow.
[113:56.84]I'm just ready.
[114:05.16]I don't think these things are even a threat.
[114:15.75]these things invading our castle.
[114:19.21]Oh shit, it's Krag!
[114:20.41]Krag?
[114:20.55]Should we just go fight and kill that thing right now?
[114:33.73]um yeah maybe because we're kind of just going to let him walk all the way up here I'm I'm aiming at him and I'm aiming my bombs I don't even know oh he's right there I missed I'm missing I got a direct hit oh he's he destroyed our thing okay I'm gonna go fight craig I I will handle the enemies that come up through here and try to get through the bridge you handle craig
[115:07.12]Crag is incoming.
[115:09.32]Can we start bombing Crag?
[115:12.72]I am.
[115:17.40]Hard to get in here with all these ogres.
[115:21.13]I am currently bombing Crag.
[115:24.01]People are getting through.
[115:29.19]Someone important.
[115:31.17]Important enough for our perfect rating.
[115:32.63]Fight four!
[115:37.77]Yes!
[115:39.27]Nice.
[115:49.20]Okay, we got a whole situation here, pal.
[116:04.63]You got the heal thing?
[116:06.07]I do.
[116:11.83]You've got to be trolling, mate.
[116:15.61]They're going to get through the gate.
[116:23.85]OK, I think I think if you just deal with those guys and I keep bombing.
[116:30.22]I will try.
[116:33.06]I think I upgraded this thing.
[116:35.15]Upgraded?
[116:35.67]Alright.
[116:41.35]They are all done.
[116:42.37]All the ones that got by are killed.
[116:44.03]I can now make my way in front of you for some cleanup.
[116:55.20]They're just walking off the edge and dying.
[116:59.37]Why is there passing making them go just walk up?
[117:01.41]No, I think that's there's the.
[117:04.03]The thing that's boosting him down there.
[117:11.45]Shit.
[117:17.74]Have you noticed this is kind of just like home steep?
[117:19.68]I think that's kind of the idea.
[117:24.14]Inspiration.
[117:27.66]What?
[117:28.97]I said, I think that's kind of the idea.
[117:30.25]It seems like it's inspired by big, you know, one of the rings type stuff.
[117:35.61]OK, there's no ladders or anything.
[117:37.25]That's a five star.
[117:42.51]You know?
[117:44.58]Perfect.
[117:47.54]All castles must be helms deep.
[117:49.58]Yeah, I'm a five star man.
[117:54.65]Alright.
[117:55.35]The tar trap.
[117:56.53]This is good.
[117:57.25]Increases slow.
[117:58.29]Absolutely.
[117:59.01]More.
[118:00.10]More.
[118:00.46]I just put all my points into this.
[118:04.24]So this thing can be amazing.
[118:08.00]I remember the ice amulet being cool.
[118:13.31]I think we can probably swap through heroes now.
[118:24.86]How many orcs does it take to break into this fucking base?
[118:27.82]Why do they keep doing the same strategy?
[118:30.02]Yeah, it's true.
[118:32.62]You think that after like a thousand years, orcs wouldn't just walk at a building anymore.
[118:38.85]You think that they would develop some new type of way to attack a base or something?
[118:45.17]Yeah, the walk at structure strategy.
[118:46.89]I don't think that's fair.
[118:48.95]Every orc only gets to try once.
[118:52.95]How are they going to learn?
[118:55.93]Well, that's what I'm saying, that all the orcs collectively have not learned that walking with a big sword or a big club is the way to do it.
[119:06.58]Sorceress, I've read all about Master Cygnus, but I don't remember Vorwick.
[119:12.40]Vorwick was the equal of Master Cygnus and just as heroic in defense of the Order.
[119:17.71]But all record of his accomplishments was wiped from history.
[119:21.71]And you're going to tell us why?
[119:23.66]I will.
[119:24.53]But first, you must deal with these orcs.
[119:27.55]Uh, hello?
[119:28.37]Are we not going to talk about how this Vorwick guy is clearly in love with the orcs?
[119:31.69]Long-range multi-shot ice attack.
[119:34.93]No, that's me.
[119:35.49]You can't copy me.
[119:36.21]I'm playing ice shot.
[119:37.97]Okay, what is this?
[119:42.60]Earthling.
[119:44.86]Weak against arcane and ice.
[119:47.56]Strong against physical damage.
[120:02.71]shoot that fast it's not fair yeah well maybe you need to get the upgrades why did we I didn't we didn't put why did we both press the button I pressed the button I'm not scared I think this is super we just we just defended helms deep I wonder how much the slow is now here they come wow it even freezes them
[120:32.49]I think it freezes him now.
[120:34.73]That was me using the ice handle.
[120:38.55]Oh, shit.
[120:39.99]Oh, shit.
[120:40.77]Oh, crap.
[120:42.35]You're right.
[120:43.23]Oh, dang it.
[120:52.83]Oh, yeah.
[120:58.50]Oh wait.
[121:00.87]Are you freezing them?
[121:03.31]No, that's you doing that.
[121:05.41]Oh, you're absolutely doing that.
[121:14.25]That's a pretty good impression.
[121:16.01]I think I can do a pretty good Bugleberry.
[121:21.05]Oh yeah.
[121:23.37]Depending on how many cards you have.
[121:24.89]I think that's pretty close.
[121:37.70]You want to be in charge of building the block?
[121:40.80]Yeah, I'm just building barricades.
[121:48.66]Actually, let me complete it.
[121:49.78]Alright.
[121:51.36]Probably a good idea.
[121:53.03]I'm out of money.
[121:53.79]Alright, I got some cash.
[121:57.35]Do you think you could drink this slime?
[121:59.59]It might kill you.
[122:11.85]The Earth Lord?
[122:13.29]Watch out!
[122:14.37]It's an Earth Lord.
[122:16.61]Oh no.
[122:16.87]Oh no.
[122:40.51]Oh, no.
[122:51.76]Wait, you knew you were doing this because you were shooting at people.
[122:55.08]Yeah.
[122:55.68]Oh, you were messing around with me.
[122:58.42]That thing's actually kind of fun.
[123:04.31]It's got like a, you know, like a ice floor Nova too.
[123:08.01]Yeah.
[123:08.25]I mean, I remember from the older games being like one of the best things you could get.
[123:12.15]Yeah.
[123:12.45]That's got one.
[123:13.53]Yeah.
[123:16.53]I'm, I'm usually like the ice guy.
[123:17.93]So like that, I'll probably be doing that.
[123:20.20]You can do like fire or something.
[123:21.26]You're like, you're just like the fire guy.
[123:22.82]I mean, like I are.
[123:23.56]Okay.
[123:23.74]We're going to have to, I'm going to have to refund all my upgrades.
[123:25.76]I mean, you know, I'm like, usually I like ice.
[123:27.74]Like I like, like ice chill and water and like, I usually I'm going to be ice.
[123:33.38]I think.
[123:34.24]I don't think that's actually true.
[123:37.66]If you need to pick an elemental wizard, honest, honest, you're joking about being an ice person.
[123:44.74]What is your elemental wizard casting?
[123:49.45]Bowling balls.
[123:49.93]Oh, so you're an earthbender.
[123:54.24]Now I'm a bowling ball vendor.
[123:57.30]And bowling balls are made of Earth.
[123:59.96]Bowling balls are made out of a synthetic material.
[124:03.96]You know, listen to this.
[124:05.08]Do you know that bowling balls... I'm going to fucking blow everybody's mind that has not seen that one YouTube video.
[124:11.38]Okay.
[124:11.82]You know, when you think of a bowling ball, what is a bowling ball?
[124:14.77]Like, what is it?
[124:15.77]It's just like a big ball, right?
[124:18.15]Yeah.
[124:19.21]No.
[124:20.27]There is shit in the... Let me fucking talk.
[124:24.45]There is... There's shit in the middle of a bowling ball.
[124:28.81]There's a core.
[124:29.85]There is a bowling ball core that is different for every bowling ball.
[124:35.50]It's like this weird metal core that's weirdly shaped depending on what kind of ball you want.
[124:42.86]it's crazy I did not know that I thought it was just a big ball of like like plastic or whatever they are next next thing you're gonna tell me is that there isn't like an underdark to the Earth and that there's also an Earth core literally incorrect I work at a bowling ball manufacturer you must not be paying attention then that's what's inside a bowling ball has a like a core in the middle
[125:11.10]do we want to make it so they have to go like through here just really stuff them in here that's only for the pro ones yeah and you're not you're not good enough to use those we said apologize to Ster what why
[125:39.45]I don't know why, but you probably owe me one.
[125:41.66]Oh, it's because I said like, what did I say?
[125:46.90]Like, shut up.
[125:47.52]I'm talking or something.
[125:48.36]I don't know.
[125:49.22]I don't think so.
[125:52.39]Shut up.
[125:52.71]You're going to want to hear about the bowling ball.
[125:54.51]You need to hear about my bowling ball facts.
[125:56.33]I'm so much smarter than everybody.
[125:58.43]I thought what was in the center of a bowling ball was your fingers.
[126:02.85]No, that's drilled in.
[126:05.59]well yeah because you like if you've got like really long fingers then your fingers are going to the core and then you're probably going to have to off balance the holes that are on one side only the pro bowling balls yeah well it's in bowling balls but it's oh that's not even true
[126:36.67]I feel like we're the bad guys I felt cool killing the orcs because they're like made in a vat and they don't even really have true sentience but as soon as like Earth elementals were against us it was like okay the Earth is is is not okay with what we're doing that's true we it was the actual orcs Earth
[127:03.24]Yeah, it's not.
[127:04.14]Orcs Must Die.
[127:05.47]And also the soul of the Earth.
[127:09.09]That's true.
[127:10.19]Also the soul of the Earth is a problem.
[127:12.63]Wrong side.
[127:32.13]Another mind-blowing fact, the Earth 4 has mountains in it.
[127:40.42]What?
[127:41.92]Go in.
[127:46.33]The Earth 4 has huge, lumpy mountains, apparently, inside of it.
[127:52.52]What are they planning in there?
[127:54.76]If we keep talking about weird facts none of us really know anything about, there's just going to be a Joe Rogan podcast.
[128:00.40]Wait.
[128:01.79]Wait.
[128:02.23]You're telling me what?
[128:03.25]There's what in the Earth?
[128:05.23]Somebody said mountains are a liberal lie.
[128:20.33]What the hell is it?
[128:20.93]What the hell is even in the core of the Earth?
[128:24.12]Isn't it like... You want lava?
[128:28.34]True.
[128:31.86]Would you be surprised if there was a fucking Duncan in the... Alright, hold on.
[128:34.69]I gotta help him.
[128:36.97]Satan's Duncan.
[128:54.86]Do you think Earth splatter or are you into the fruit roll up model?
[129:01.98]Fruit roll up?
[129:03.06]Yeah, it's like the Earth is flat, but it's actually rolled up on top of itself like a fruit roll up.
[129:11.85]I think the bigger question to ask is like, I don't know, don't you think it's kind of ridiculous?
[129:18.02]It's ridiculous.
[129:19.70]Like how plants function, like how we put these things in the ground, they become these gigantic fucking monstrous things.
[129:25.67]That's ridiculous, isn't it?
[129:26.63]Isn't that like kind of crazy?
[129:29.01]I wholeheartedly and completely agree.
[129:31.87]Plants are fucked up and anyone who's doubting it is like these things.
[129:37.04]Okay.
[129:37.22]So you're telling me they're alive.
[129:38.98]They live for hundreds of years, like thousands of years, like the great Redwood Oaks and shit that are like, you could drive a car through these fucking things.
[129:48.85]And they're just, they're just living.
[129:51.17]True.
[130:01.95]Yeah, it's so... Growing sunflowers kind of really changed my view of everything.
[130:09.33]It's kind of funny how... I'm serious.
[130:12.09]Okay.
[130:12.55]No, I'm...
[130:14.32]Hold on.
[130:14.96]Let me cook for a second.
[130:16.24]Was it laughing at sunflowers changing your perspective of reality?
[130:20.33]Something funny happened in the game.
[130:21.67]You put one seed in the ground, and this thing grows to be 10 feet tall, and then hundreds of other seeds appear inside of this thing's head, which then you can individually put in the ground that turn into this thing, which also produce hundreds of things to put in the ground.
[130:41.44]Isn't it kind of the same thing with people, though?
[130:44.24]You just put one seed in?
[130:47.12]And you could end up with hundreds of people?
[130:48.70]Yeah, but no, no, no.
[130:49.65]I mean, kind of, in a way, but no.
[130:54.25]Because we're talking about, like, thousands and thousands of seeds.
[130:58.05]Okay.
[131:02.26]One person doesn't have thousands and thousands of babies.
[131:09.06]I mean, back in the old days...
[131:17.44]Speak for yourself.
[131:25.53]What does he mean?
[131:27.45]One person who doesn't get thousands of seeds.
[131:32.18]What is he saying?
[131:34.62]I mean, there's no real point of what I'm saying.
[131:36.10]I'm saying it's kind of remarkable that that look like a corn.
[131:39.87]A corn?
[131:41.77]That's wild.
[131:46.22]It's wild.
[131:46.80]I agree.
[131:47.40]I agree.
[131:48.50]I'm dead.
[131:49.52]You know what about nature gets me?
[131:52.07]If we're going to take a step back from corn for one second.
[131:56.29]How you get all of these in a rainforest in this really tiny ecosystem, you'll get like...
[132:02.00]One bug or a plant.
[132:04.18]We'll stay on plants.
[132:05.28]A plant that evolves its flowers to look like a very specific kind of butterfly to attract that.
[132:11.39]Like, how does the plant wake up in the morning and go, I know that, that like monarch.
[132:16.99]I'm going to be that monarch.
[132:22.44]Or let's talk nature.
[132:24.06]You want to hear nature?
[132:25.06]What's that bird that can literally imitate the sound of a chainsaw like it's a recording?
[132:37.46]they can play back sound effects exactly the way that they sounded it is a recording what was that guy's name from police academy he got so much credit and birds were doing it already
[132:57.41]All we need now, Ster, is we need that YouTube Shorts fucking music thing to play in the background while we talk about this.
[133:04.75]The one that goes... I know that there's one that plays.
[133:15.00]I didn't know that it went... Like a Christmas Halloween witch.
[133:20.72]Okay, we're having some trouble.
[133:21.86]We're having some trouble.
[133:23.14]What?
[133:24.14]At the rift.
[133:25.68]What do you do?
[133:27.47]There's some guys here.
[133:28.45]You're dead.
[133:33.58]We win.
[133:40.30]That's Michael Winslow.
[133:42.28]Yeah, the sound effects guy.
[133:43.58]Michael Winslow is so talented.
[133:45.00]It's unbelievable what Michael Winslow can do.
[133:47.61]The X-Files?
[133:48.67]Oh, I was thinking the other one.
[133:49.61]Whenever someone's like, like speaking like the truth, it's got this like low, rumbly, edgy, sort of, I don't know how to put it.
[134:00.88]Are you planning on doing anything with fire?
[134:02.70]And I know I made this stupid joke that I want to be the ice guy, but one of the unique upgrades on this is enemies that are in the tar trap take more fire damage.
[134:15.61]Go for it.
[134:18.34]I'm the ice guy looks like are you guys uh is there not even a fire weapon yet I don't even know why I picked that I don't know I don't really know I don't really want anything new kane what about dwarven worm
[134:47.09]Stone Staff.
[134:49.19]Physical Attack.
[134:51.07]Wind Belt.
[134:53.51]Flame Bracers.
[134:55.17]Okay, I'm almost ready for it.
[134:56.65]Is there anything else I can do?
[135:08.70]We're using the barricades a lot.
[135:09.92]I want to reduce their cost.
[135:12.63]I'm refunding all my upgrades.
[135:15.41]Don't start.
[135:15.89]I have nothing.
[135:16.95]I already did.
[135:17.73]Don't start.
[135:18.25]Don't!
[135:18.55]Don't!
[135:19.43]You pressed it already.
[135:20.45]Wait, we have a new thing.
[135:23.44]I don't!
[135:23.86]Look at how cool this looks.
[135:25.44]Should we go back?
[135:25.92]Can we?
[135:26.10]I refunded every upgrade right before we started.
[135:29.66]I guess we could just go back.
[135:41.52]Or do you want to... Do you think you can handle it?
[135:44.22]I think I can handle it.
[135:45.28]You're supposed to be a gamer.
[135:46.66]Actually, no, no, no, no, no.
[135:47.44]I don't want to be responsible for fucking up this whole thing.
[135:49.26]So, we'll go back.
[135:50.94]I mean, do you not trust me?
[135:52.72]No, I just don't... I'm the only one that can place stuff on the ground and I will... I can place stuff.
[135:57.03]Oh, you can?
[135:58.11]Yeah.
[135:58.71]It's just I don't have... None of my stuff is upgraded.
[136:01.23]What's this new archer thing we got?
[136:04.47]Oh, we got a lady.
[136:05.21]What is it?
[136:06.79]We just make ladies.
[136:10.78]Guardian Archer.
[136:11.96]Medium range unit.
[136:13.10]Committed to defending order rifts.
[136:14.95]Deals... Okay, I think... What do you do to say to someone who doesn't like cheese to convince them that they are wrong?
[136:24.89]You take a step back and understand that people have preferences that are not yours.
[136:30.28]And you relax.
[136:37.15]Okay, what do you say to someone who thinks corn is like normal?
[136:39.65]You get fucking furious.
[136:42.07]Wait, no, no, no.
[136:42.75]You said normal.
[136:43.63]No, that's fine.
[136:46.02]Weren't we just talking about how weird corn is?
[136:50.16]I'm just going to block one of these.
[136:51.66]That'll work.
[136:54.12]Can they cross the lake?
[136:57.06]Probably not, right?
[137:02.61]Perfect placement.
[137:08.68]Okay, I guess we're ready.
[137:09.36]Yeah, I'm good.
[137:12.62]Good.
[137:12.74]Watch out, here they come.
[137:13.71]The funny way you do, yeah.
[137:15.13]Stones?
[137:16.57]Oh, stones.
[137:17.97]There.
[137:19.61]Ster, that'll be $1,000.
[137:20.13]I didn't ask.
[137:20.69]But I want you to pay for it.
[137:22.27]Here they come.
[137:33.06]no okay you know what last time last like four times you did this joke I paid you I'm not doing it this time um you're gonna kill the troll troll yeah but I mean I appreciate that
[138:09.56]Yeah, me and the elves got this covered.
[138:11.96]So did you play any of, uh, you playing, uh, any World of Warcraft lately?
[138:30.48]No.
[138:32.58]why is that uh because we don't have time to dedicate to World of Warcraft right now but don't you just like get your gear score up to like a certain amount then there's no content to do anyway um so like like how much time do you really need to dedicate to that I mean it takes I don't know I just don't I don't really want to play an MMO
[139:02.32]okay just wondering but why though I I don't know I'm just wondering I know they had like dragon play and like I don't know do you really talk about like wow I haven't played did you put all those archers up there that's actually a really good idea I did I got the goons really smart also they're all loyal to me
[139:40.53]Okay, so now we gotta figure out this part here.
[139:52.72]Now we've got to watch out.
[139:57.90]There's more coming.
[140:00.97]I think we need to block one of these.
[140:04.73]Should I move here?
[140:08.47]Stop pressing buttons on your Go XLR.
[140:11.14]That stopped being funny four or five years ago.
[140:13.26]Wait, you want to block all of them on one side?
[140:14.42]Then they're only coming to one side.
[140:19.69]Like, if we can, like, barricade this whole spot.
[140:22.00]Have you got money?
[140:22.56]Got money right there?
[140:23.60]I do.
[140:23.72]I got money.
[140:24.38]Got money?
[140:25.14]I do.
[140:26.48]Do it.
[140:27.94]That's tar.
[140:29.32]That's tar.
[140:30.04]I messed it up.
[140:30.40]I messed it up.
[140:30.74]I didn't mean to.
[140:31.34]Did you see tar?
[140:33.19]I have it on my bar.
[140:37.13]Okay.
[140:37.45]+2 to Ster.
[140:38.17]-2 to clown boy.
[140:40.91]I don't think that's fair.
[140:47.65]So what about this other side then?
[140:49.39]Where they're going this way?
[140:52.43]So is the idea that they're going to only come up this staircase?
[140:55.09]Yeah, that seems to be how it's going.
[140:57.57]And then they're all going to walk past my archers.
[141:02.21]Well, I guess let's do it.
[141:03.71]Yeah, now's the time.
[141:05.75]I mean, what else is there to do?
[141:08.05]But do it.
[141:10.51]So be prepared.
[141:12.79]Another door is being attacked.
[141:15.12]I should focus on this door first because they got the shortest path.
[141:17.80]I'm just gonna stay up here.
[141:23.39]Would you say you're a nerd, a dork, or a geek?
[141:30.13]Uh, nerd.
[141:31.75]I think I'm a dork.
[141:33.93]I agree.
[141:34.35]I agree with that.
[141:40.62]I thought that was you.
[141:42.48]I thought like you exploded into blood.
[141:45.74]Yes, so they're figuring out they can't go that way and they're turning around.
[141:48.71]Yeah, this is a. Just like in training.
[142:11.66]Corners looking a little little rough.
[142:17.66]Alright, I don't know.
[142:18.74]In my brain, you said, corner is looking a little rough.
[142:24.45]And in my head, we were talking about corn.
[142:27.85]And everybody calls themselves the thing that we're currently... Oh, like Drew Crew!
[142:32.75]Like Drewers and stuff.
[142:34.85]I thought you were talking about people that enjoy corn in the chat.
[142:37.53]Because we were talking shit about corn earlier.
[142:41.34]Like, oh, the corners are looking like they're really rough right now.
[142:46.12]I was like, what is he?
[142:46.70]Why are you saying that?
[142:49.94]Well, I wasn't saying that.
[142:53.28]Is the secret.
[142:54.17]Yeah.
[142:55.55]I know that now.
[142:59.29]Corn crew.
[143:00.07]Yeah, corn crew.
[143:04.91]Corners.
[143:05.51]The corners.
[143:06.11]The corn guys or whatever.
[143:14.22]These archers, with all my upgrade points that I don't have and was unable to use, I think I'm going to upgrade these archers.
[143:21.12]They seem actually really good.
[143:31.65]They can't even get through.
[143:33.45]You've got this completely on lockdown.
[143:50.68]Shout out to you know, actually, I had corn yesterday.
[143:53.70]How is that?
[143:54.72]How funny is that?
[143:55.58]It is not necessarily that surprising.
[143:59.05]Corn is like a base of tons of different meals.
[144:03.67]Yeah, but like raw corn.
[144:08.85]How funny is that?
[144:10.79]Wait, that's funny.
[144:15.07]That's funny.
[144:17.27]Mm hmm.
[144:18.43]What?
[144:26.69]Yeah, I thought so.
[144:28.33]Do you want me to block this so they have to go, like, I guess, like, I don't know, here?
[144:33.54]I don't think you're needed.
[144:34.66]I don't think so either.
[144:36.76]I think we're gonna lose our jobs to these archers.
[145:04.27]Ooh, they are coming this way.
[145:08.07]Don't worry about it.
[145:09.25]My gals will handle it.
[145:14.35]They're already doing this well with two or three points.
[145:16.37]I feel like they're going to be disgusting.
[145:21.52]Two or three points?
[145:22.32]What?
[145:23.94]If you upgrade them.
[145:25.60]Yes.
[145:27.22]Yes.
[145:28.16]Yes.
[145:29.54]You get it.
[145:30.74]Yes.
[145:32.40]This guy fucking gets it.
[145:38.10]Corn on the cob or corn from the can?
[145:41.08]Corn from the can... You gave me the option of like natural from the Earth and canned corn.
[145:51.63]Yeah, but corn from the Earth can be kind of messy.
[145:57.52]I love corn on the cob.
[145:59.14]It's an S tier.
[146:02.82]But it can get kind of messy.
[146:04.69]And you get that thing where there's those weird fibers that go into every single gap in every single one of your teeth.
[146:10.89]uh I'm gonna say uh that we're living in like we're lucky to be living in the like very brief part of human history right before we all start to like live in spaceships and like in vats and we're like grown um right and we're gonna be like one of the last generations that can appreciate like really like grown foods so I'm every time I'm gonna choose something that's not out of a can
[146:37.33]That's just one of the many privileges of living in this era.
[146:41.66]Why are you assuming that the corn that they pull off the cobs and put into the cans is somehow not real?
[146:48.60]I mean, it's every, every, you know, a couple of years, it's getting less and less real.
[146:52.33]This is the problem.
[146:54.01]I can understand that.
[146:59.37]It's going to be all virtual.
[147:06.13]I mean, if Facebook alien guy will have his fucking way.
[147:13.77]Hey, wait in the metaverse to have a meal.
[147:15.41]Hey, we have bombs to drop.
[147:17.39]You see these barrels?
[147:19.06]Yeah.
[147:20.08]Have we done it once?
[147:21.56]No.
[147:21.90]Have we needed it?
[147:23.48]No, but it's kind of fun to do.
[147:26.02]I assumed that they were limited, so I didn't want to waste them.
[147:33.54]but I don't know I'll shoot one I'll do it just wait till we need it corn could be ground hydroponically with spaceships right you wrote ground instead of grown like I'm not going to trust a single thing out of your mouth it's not happening that way well this means corn flour you've had a corn tortilla before well once they start growing it on the spaceships it's gonna be all like
[148:01.95]a barricade is under attack like grown with like super hormones and you know what I mean the barricade is down there are enemies like a strawberry today isn't what a strawberry was in the old days
[148:31.52]Oh, they're gonna get in.
[148:33.58]What happened?
[148:34.63]I didn't do anything.
[148:35.55]What?
[148:39.29]We just almost lost in one second.
[148:41.75]What happened?
[148:42.35]I'm dead.
[148:44.23]I don't know.
[148:44.63]They broke it.
[148:45.93]What?
[148:48.67]Okay.
[148:49.35]I don't know how or why.
[148:51.13]This is fine.
[148:53.83]I rebuilt it.
[148:54.48]One of them was destroyed.
[148:56.42]Okay.
[149:00.13]Should I put some stuff here to hurt them?
[149:03.79]I'm gonna.
[149:05.33]And let's do this too.
[149:08.53]I mean, I'm going to get some shit here.
[149:12.69]So they can slow down.
[149:26.22]Not so tough now.
[149:30.39]Do you?
[149:30.69]OK, here's here's a, you know, continuing down that line of thinking, because my brain went a little bit on it a little bit too long.
[149:35.94]And this is when we get like the truly transcendent takes.
[149:39.78]So they're learning how to make.
[149:43.94]They're growing meat in labs.
[149:45.67]What are you?
[149:46.93]What do you say?
[149:47.39]Are you kidding me?
[149:48.31]What?
[149:48.99]No, they aren't.
[149:50.95]Where did you hear this from?
[149:52.25]Are you fucking kidding me?
[149:53.71]I just read it on the Internet.
[149:56.63]I read it on the Internet destroyed a barricade.
[150:02.74]Have you had your fun?
[150:04.78]Do you want to have a conversation with me or do you want me to shut up?
[150:07.07]Oh, I was going to say that's whatever you said.
[150:09.49]They're getting in the back.
[150:15.61]Oh, it's over, dude.
[150:16.95]It's over.
[150:17.33]How did they do this?
[150:21.24]How did they?
[150:21.64]We're going to.
[150:22.00]Oh, my God.
[150:23.54]It's over.
[150:23.96]Dude, it's over.
[150:26.26]We don't stand a chance.
[150:28.52]I'm staying in the room.
[150:29.44]We're fine.
[150:30.56]We're fine.
[150:36.76]enemies at the rift holy we're in trouble five yeah five the lady archers are up here too they're helping thank goodness there are enemies in our rift room
[151:08.07]Well, that was almost a disaster.
[151:09.89]That was scary.
[151:12.25]That's what I'm talking about.
[151:13.43]We had five stars too.
[151:14.79]You gotta be kidding me.
[151:17.44]Okay.
[151:20.08]Nevermind, I have to do all of my upgrades.
[151:21.96]I'm not getting distracted on this right now.
[151:23.84]There are more important things in life.
[151:26.08]Yes, I will.
[151:27.23]Bank of archers?
[151:28.31]What is a bank of archers?
[151:36.23]So it looks like the only upgrade for the Guardian Archer is health.
[151:42.65]Fire damage.
[151:43.67]I have something that increases fire damage.
[151:46.85]Okay.
[151:47.11]I took the fire damage.
[151:48.08]I put that.
[151:48.68]Because the slow, the Tar Traps, you do more fire damage.
[152:09.19]There's a bunch of other stuff I want to look at.
[152:11.97]Confusion flower.
[152:14.89]This 10 second song is actually fire.
[152:16.97]That's kind of cool.
[152:21.48]So imagine that they attack each other.
[152:27.64]Giant killer beehive tree.
[152:34.82]Dwarven hammer is pog.
[152:35.96]You have to get it.
[152:45.39]The Shock Zapper.
[152:53.76]These all sound like One Punch Man characters.
[152:58.20]Snow Cannon.
[152:59.46]Shock Zapper.
[153:01.58]Ripsaw.
[153:02.98]Sawblade Launcher.
[153:06.34]Tornado in a Box.
[153:08.82]Friend Kisser.
[153:19.57]okay uh where's my thing that I mean let's just say you could like try it I'm gonna get the flame thing okay I've re-bought all new stuff I'm good what I was gonna say is in the future even they're growing meat in labs yeah right
[153:46.98]so at what point will it be considered like you're no longer a vegetarian if you eat grown vegetables like oh this corn grew out of the ground and like that's no we only eat lab grown stuff like if you're eating like Earth grown stuff you're actually a bad person and you aren't a real vegetarian because you're not eating lab grown meat that's the only like truly moral way because plants have feelings too
[154:11.23]Well, I mean, I think that there's a very big question to have about how to have a more ethical meat industry.
[154:17.33]I think that that's a good question to ask.
[154:19.29]I really do.
[154:22.56]But, I mean, that's like a six-hour conversation.
[154:27.98]And you're not ready for that.
[154:29.06]I don't think you're ready for that one.
[154:31.43]Why am I not ready?
[154:34.07]Nice politician answer.
[154:38.43]Well, you know, I think there is a question to be had about ethical meat and how we address that and how we, going forward, we come up with these complex solutions that eventually will put our humanity, obviously, forward and first throughout our galaxy and throughout, obviously, the cosmos.
[154:55.62]But the complex questions and answers that we've been asking about this exact topic
[155:00.58]is absolutely something that we can address and we can move forward when that time comes to that topic.
[155:06.36]And that topic is incredibly important, by the way.
[155:07.94]I want to make sure you understand that.
[155:09.28]The topic at hand we're discussing is this concept that I think a lot of people really, they relate to.
[155:16.07]And I think that it's a very good question and I yield the rest of my time.
[155:26.25]I'm glad you're taking it seriously.
[155:28.43]Oh, Doug, Doug, Raid!
[155:31.54]What's going on?
[155:33.36]Thanks for the raid.
[155:34.87]Welcome, raiders.
[155:36.11]Welcome, DougDoug viewers.
[155:38.23]Thanks, DougDoug.
[155:40.01]Plains of Orcs Must Die.
[155:40.85]We Ster.
[155:42.87]Oh, you came in at a really weird spot when I was... That's kind of funny.
[155:46.89]Yeah.
[155:47.35]Welcome.
[155:47.59]Thanks.
[155:51.13]I saw DougDoug doing a funny thing.
[155:54.39]Trying to get his chat to beat Mario Maker levels.
[155:58.49]He had one life to do it.
[156:01.48]That was pretty fun.
[156:02.30]I'm dead!
[156:03.72]Yeah, welcome.
[156:09.97]You've got to be trolling me.
[156:18.13]I do have a question for Dug Dove viewers.
[156:19.61]Did you actually do it?
[156:21.39]Did you actually do it?
[156:23.23]Did you beat those levels in a row?
[156:27.36]You actually did it.
[156:28.08]Okay.
[156:28.60]Okay.
[156:32.06]No, I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[156:40.85]How are we handling this?
[156:42.57]This is like a big scary one.
[156:44.21]I put a barricade on the left side so they're all going to go on the right.
[156:47.41]And then we have our super abilities this time.
[156:50.32]So I don't know.
[156:51.98]Anything you want to do, man.
[156:54.28]We have new super abilities, though.
[156:55.66]It's important.
[156:56.74]Yeah, I put a whole bunch of ladies up here.
[157:02.06]what should we block I blocked the left side well I mean what sorry let me rephrase that what should I block because I have um ability um um okay here let me let me like grab you by the hand
[157:25.15]Well, I'm just trying to see what... I don't know.
[157:27.59]I really, I don't know.
[157:28.89]But you should make, at the end of here, you should place one of those giant mortars.
[157:34.73]Okay.
[157:35.52]And then we could, like, snake them down this whole way.
[157:37.22]So I'm going to put it right here.
[157:40.42]I could put another one.
[157:41.64]Do you want me to put one up with you?
[157:43.30]No, I think you should make some snakes.
[157:45.20]Okay.
[157:46.58]On this bridge, you're talking at the beginning, go like... Yeah, do like a little... Oh, okay.
[157:52.81]I can make like a...
[157:55.11]Yeah.
[157:55.73]I think that sounds good.
[157:58.38]Is this enough space for them to move through?
[158:00.66]Yes, it is.
[158:04.74]How thin does it have to be?
[158:06.70]For the... Like, can I put it here?
[158:10.24]Will this work?
[158:10.86]Or is that not enough?
[158:13.36]Um... No, see, like, ogres are going to smash this.
[158:16.61]They need two by twos.
[158:21.15]Perhaps one of these.
[158:27.37]That is all I can do.
[158:29.93]I'm going to get into the launcher.
[158:36.03]Do you follow a build guide when you cook?
[158:40.97]A recipe?
[158:42.63]Yeah.
[158:46.79]I guess it depends on what... If it's something complicated, yeah.
[158:51.15]If I already know what I'm doing.
[158:52.11]Can you have fun cooking something you've never cooked before without a build guide?
[158:56.74]I think it can be, yeah.
[158:57.54]I think if you just kind of experiment.
[158:58.85]Then why do you need your handheld for PoE?
[159:04.76]Because there's not 12,000 ingredients in a fucking steak and cheese sandwich.
[159:09.58]There's literally any ingredient in the whole world you could put in it at any time.
[159:13.05]You could randomly even choose to put, like, Tabasco sauce and blue cheese and dip your pizza in it.
[159:20.45]Yeah, but the difference is you are... Oh, shit.
[159:25.95]You got me.
[159:26.86]Fuck you.
[159:27.70]Hold on.
[159:28.98]Give me a minute.
[159:29.46]I'll come up with something.
[159:31.16]Okay.
[159:32.86]Good luck.
[159:33.87]Yeah, there's, like, every ingredient is available.
[159:36.82]Look, laugh at that guy.
[159:38.98]Every ingredient is available.
[159:41.26]So, therefore, like, I'm full of shit because why... Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[159:47.39]Okay, hold on.
[159:48.71]If I go to the grocery store and I know what I want to make.
[159:51.15]For instance, I want to make a, like, a fire mage, right?
[159:56.62]You want to go to the grocery store and you want to cook a fire mage.
[160:00.88]No, you don't get it.
[160:01.60]You don't get it.
[160:02.57]I'm trying to make a...
[160:09.61]Like if I want to go to the grocery store and make like a salmon, like a pan seared salmon.
[160:16.30]I know exactly what I need to buy to do that.
[160:18.56]I'm going to buy salmon.
[160:19.60]I'm going to get, you know, like oil for the pan.
[160:22.54]I'm going to get like some dill.
[160:24.32]I know what that is.
[160:25.44]It's only like four things to make that.
[160:27.87]If I want to make a pan seared salmon in Path of Exile, I need to look at every fucking food that's ever existed.
[160:35.05]What?
[160:37.35]We lost a few.
[160:38.05]Hold the L. Hold the L?
[160:38.81]Yeah.
[160:44.42]on them getting the end.
[160:45.88]Here's what I'm saying, though.
[160:47.02]If you know you want to make a pizza, then you start with pizza dough.
[160:49.44]But if you know you want to make an archer, then you start with a bow.
[160:51.82]It's the same thing.
[160:52.56]Yeah, but it's not.
[160:53.76]But here's the thing.
[160:54.36]If you come to me and say, hey, dude, we're thinking about pizza tonight.
[160:57.70]Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
[160:59.34]What kind of pizza are we going to have tonight?
[161:01.18]And then you back a truck up in my driveway and every single pizza ingredient, every topping ever is put out into the fucking driveway.
[161:08.85]And it's like, oh, yeah, there's like 700 different things that could go on pizza.
[161:12.75]What do you want?
[161:14.41]I don't know.
[161:16.15]How do I just have like a pepperoni pizza and then you have to go, hold on a second.
[161:19.53]And you like dig through all the ingredients and be like, no, that's grapefruit.
[161:22.89]What is this one?
[161:23.78]Oh, that's pineapple.
[161:24.88]Hold on.
[161:25.12]I can find it.
[161:25.68]Let me find the pepperoni.
[161:28.12]It'll take me a minute.
[161:29.88]I need the guidance.
[161:34.16]Okay.
[161:36.74]Here's where they will fall.
[161:39.60]You're not winning this?
[161:41.28]As long as... As long as my constituents care, right?
[161:45.93]Then I win.
[161:48.37]I don't know if my archers were shooting anything.
[161:51.33]Were they not shooting?
[161:53.43]I know they're up like on this hill.
[161:55.62]I don't think anything's walking close enough.
[161:58.84]Wait, that means you guys... Wait, you guys were against me though.
[162:03.30]Shit.
[162:03.52]I'm going to lose the election to Ster.
[162:06.02]I think we both win.
[162:11.59]Oh, you got that flower.
[162:12.67]Is it any good?
[162:13.09]That's the first time I've used it.
[162:19.50]I'm ready to start.
[162:20.70]Yeah, I saw these guys were like stunned every time I looked over here.
[162:26.06]And what is this shift for?
[162:27.88]What is this giant tower?
[162:32.94]What?
[162:35.75]Oh, by the way, all the pizzas... Here's another scenario.
[162:38.55]You've cooked every pizza.
[162:41.60]You back up with a truck and every topping, every combination is in that truck.
[162:46.63]And they're all open.
[162:47.69]Everyone's like opening up like, oh, look, hot and fresh and ready.
[162:49.73]Which one do you want?
[162:51.05]And I'm just like, I don't, that one has olives on it.
[162:54.35]I don't know.
[162:54.69]Do I want olives today?
[162:55.61]I don't think I do.
[162:56.67]Where's the, who's, who has just the pepperoni?
[163:01.00]Who has pepperoni?
[163:01.94]And there's somebody in the back just like screaming.
[163:03.64]I got it.
[163:04.14]I got it.
[163:04.56]But I have to like, this guy's got fucking pineapple on it.
[163:06.50]I don't know what, I don't know which one I want.
[163:10.98]You're trying to min-max your pizzas, your problem.
[163:14.91]You're worried about picking the wrong ingredient for your pizza.
[163:17.37]Election lost.
[163:18.97]This is just like Helm's Deep.
[163:30.77]It is.
[163:31.19]And hey, let me tell you something.
[163:36.65]I am fully prepared to enjoy any pizza.
[163:40.07]I just need to know.
[163:40.71]I need a little bit of help with what it is.
[163:42.55]Okay.
[163:46.49]I'm so ready to open Path of Exile and become obsessed with it.
[163:49.33]I will be obsessed with it.
[163:51.89]I just need to know where to start.
[163:52.93]Why are you speaking like you're the president?
[163:58.17]I'm the president of this channel.
[164:02.33]Aren't I?
[164:06.11]I could see that.
[164:06.63]I could definitely see that.
[164:08.91]I can see how you are.
[164:11.65]Who's the people saying no?
[164:12.97]Who's the president of this channel then?
[164:15.37]Yeah, we got a lot of guys coming through here.
[164:27.32]VRJosh.
[164:29.98]How can I be the VP?
[164:34.35]Would you run for office with me as your VP?
[164:36.45]Am I just like the publicist of my own channel?
[164:38.95]What are we talking about?
[164:41.93]Am I like a PR agent for me?
[164:43.99]Oh, it's me.
[164:46.80]I own this shit.
[164:47.80]Hold on.
[164:53.18]I'm doing like too much goofy stuff.
[164:54.58]I feel like we're going to lose.
[164:56.06]Spent all my money on like towers.
[164:58.78]I think we'll be alright.
[164:59.90]I don't think we're doing anything.
[165:01.46]If we did, it would be fine.
[165:04.98]I don't know if you sell things for full value.
[165:07.79]You're the mascot.
[165:19.46]Yeah, that's fine.
[165:20.48]I am the mascot.
[165:21.64]I get out there in the fursuit and I do dances and put my hands up.
[165:26.54]And then it's like... I'm super getting the crowd pumped up and then I take the fucking helmet off and I'm like, let's talk about the issues now.
[165:37.95]And then everyone listens.
[165:39.73]Why can't I be both?
[165:44.28]You lost me at fursuit.
[165:45.92]I just got distracted.
[165:47.84]I got a heal for you.
[165:53.23]started thinking about legoshi first I don't know for um like mascot costume all these archers are dying and I don't know what to all the way on the top of the tower we're gonna do a recall on you a barricade is under attack
[166:36.98]no better spot than here I am out of money LOL poor if they was if they was pvp you'd be in trouble I'm gonna go sell these giant towers
[166:57.08]Okay, we definitely need stuff in here.
[167:00.07]If I'm going to be barricade... If I'm going to be the barricader, you need to... You need to put some stuff in the middle here.
[167:07.59]Because it kind of just waltzes right through.
[167:11.17]I'm having some trouble.
[167:23.26]Oh, he died.
[167:29.77]I just need a minute.
[167:30.57]Take your time.
[167:31.93]You got time.
[167:40.27]Mods, ban me perma.
[167:41.64]I am bored.
[167:46.42]As a raider from DuckDuck said that.
[167:47.74]I'm going to tell on you.
[168:03.10]OK, I'm tarring it up.
[168:05.56]This spot is perfect.
[168:10.67]So what does the big the big block thing here?
[168:13.89]What does this even do?
[168:16.11]The big block thing that this huge like the tower you can build things on the top of the tree house and the portal takes you to the top of it.
[168:26.23]I was putting archers on the top, but they were still dying, so I gave up.
[168:32.27]I'm ready.
[168:33.47]Waiting for player.
[168:35.07]Is that you?
[168:35.71]Are you player?
[168:36.19]Uh, yeah.
[168:45.32]Are you in the, uh, cannon?
[168:47.24]No.
[168:48.67]It's a very expensive thing that's just sitting there as a giant.
[168:51.35]You're not using it?
[168:54.09]I can come use it.
[168:54.81]Uh, no, I gotta get it.
[168:57.81]I gotta get it.
[169:06.51]Oh my god, you have so... There are so many archers up there.
[169:09.57]It looks like a joke.
[169:10.41]It looks like you spawned them in like Gmod.
[169:12.01]There's way too many up there.
[169:15.17]Can they even shoot?
[169:15.99]I don't know.
[169:18.71]Yeah, they're like shooting like big volleys.
[169:26.55]They're starting to get through a little.
[169:30.20]I think we're alright.
[169:49.38]As long as we just focus on the bridge.
[169:53.23]Keep your eyes on the prize, which is winning.
[170:00.78]We should play plate up again.
[170:02.10]Didn't we beat the game?
[170:03.66]I mean, there's a lot more to it.
[170:10.03]We did win a run.
[170:11.73]I forgot it's kind of like Binding of Isaac.
[170:17.41]You just do it again.
[170:42.73]nice shot thanks pal I really mean it you killed like 10 things or more I'm unleashing my fury
[171:11.10]unleashing my rage we got him so that that that's a confusion flower yeah I don't know what it's doing to him honestly I think it's like it's confusing him it looks like it's eating them or something hard to tell I think it's like eating them and then spitting them out
[171:37.10]I think they're just dying it says that it would confuse them for a while oh no no okay it's not like I thought it was closing around them I think it's just when it opens it puts out like an easy victory nice alright cool do you think do we need more damage down this kind of these rows or do we need them to be slower I think we're set
[172:08.05]Which one?
[172:10.79]You know what?
[172:11.15]You choose.
[172:12.57]I can't.
[172:13.13]I can't make this pizza for you.
[172:14.62]I'm going damage.
[172:17.72]That's going to be extreme.
[172:32.61]That's a lot of archers.
[172:34.41]I was just saying, just making sure we're good.
[172:50.43]Oh man, this is a lot like Helm's Deep.
[172:53.13]Well, now it is.
[173:01.64]That should hit a lot.
[173:06.28]What?
[173:08.70]Wait, what?
[173:10.82]Wait, what?
[173:15.67]You hit me!
[173:28.25]Really guys?
[173:42.60]Reference reference reference reference.
[173:44.20]He made a reference reference reference reference reference.
[173:48.18]Wait attack me what?
[173:50.96]Alright, I gotta get up.
[174:00.85]The archers really do rain just absolute hell down.
[174:06.07]Yeah.
[174:08.36]I think I'm just going to keep buying archers.
[174:30.68]totally under control we actually do have it completely under control you're right I'm I'm curious it feels like these stages they don't intend for you to like
[174:43.94]It's a big stage for them to just walk to the left and go, like, nah, let's all go down this one long row.
[174:50.33]But how would they not expect that to be what happened?
[174:54.65]Well, I think this is a big skeleton.
[174:57.65]I think a lot of it is probably... Won't they start attacking it eventually?
[175:00.75]Or they were before.
[175:01.63]What made them attack it before?
[175:02.92]I have no idea.
[175:06.72]I think the game just wants you to be efficient and says, hey, pick a way to be efficient.
[175:10.01]It doesn't matter how.
[175:12.19]And like, that's fine.
[175:13.71]That's the way that they're going to run.
[175:31.78]every map has special challenges exploding tollbobs do not reroute so they'll just blow up a barricade that's good to know and perhaps that's what happened does it show like what enemies are in the next wave it does uh on the screen before we start it shows a list of everything that's in it
[175:58.88]Should I start making archers, too, for fun?
[176:01.52]How much money do you have?
[176:03.22]4,300?
[176:03.24]Yeah.
[176:07.18]I think you can put some up here.
[176:08.20]You know what?
[176:09.66]I'll do it.
[176:09.98]I'm already here.
[176:15.84]I'm ready.
[176:17.36]I'm ready.
[176:27.37]You can play the hard mode now, by the way.
[176:29.45]Ooh, we should try it.
[176:32.89]Oh shit, it's Gorbache.
[176:35.12]Gorbache, Gorbache, Gorbache, Gorbache, Gorbache.
[176:39.34]Shameless stole the nemesis system.
[176:42.22]He will try and destroy any barricades we have.
[176:51.02]I'm looking forward to the Wonder Woman game made by the same company.
[176:55.35]Oh, I didn't even I haven't seen anything of it.
[177:00.97]I don't know if it's been very much shown, but it's made by Monolith, so I have pretty good hope for it.
[177:17.16]Uh, the left side.
[177:20.12]Yeah, I see.
[177:22.40]We were just talking shit about this barricade and... Oops.
[177:26.58]Okay.
[177:27.32]I got a long way to go.
[177:28.04]Oh, shit.
[177:34.64]Uh, okay.
[177:35.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[177:35.57]I, um...
[177:44.50]You got any money?
[177:46.48]Enough to do that.
[177:54.78]Oh, shit.
[177:55.20]It's okay.
[178:04.58]We can lose one.
[178:05.54]The other ones are starting to get through on the other side.
[178:07.33]I think we're going to have to pull back into these rooms.
[178:10.17]Yeah.
[178:11.63]But it's just like almost deep.
[178:18.66]Oh, there's so many ways they can come in here.
[178:21.32]There are enemies in our rift room.
[178:23.36]They're attacking the barricade.
[178:24.48]They've destroyed the barricade.
[178:27.34]Oh, Gorbash is coming.
[178:28.38]That's why.
[178:29.06]Gorbash destroyed it.
[178:30.10]Oh, Gorbash did it?
[178:32.58]I think we lose.
[178:33.26]No, we're fine.
[178:34.40]The barricade is under.
[178:35.42]The barricade is down.
[178:37.22]Just stop crying.
[178:43.69]Enemies at the rift.
[178:45.75]I need more coins.
[178:50.21]Don't let them in.
[178:55.95]Oh, he's just going around and breaking all of our barricades.
[178:58.13]He doesn't care about anything else.
[179:05.86]Okay.
[179:06.36]Any stragglers are going to get caught.
[179:08.40]He's kind of just standing over there.
[179:12.55]Do we got to go gore bash him?
[179:13.99]I think we... No, dude, he's going all the way back to destroy the other barricade.
[179:18.79]He's not even part of the fight.
[179:20.29]He's slowly going to destroy the other barricade.
[179:23.77]Is he dead?
[179:24.26]Oh, your archers killed him.
[179:26.82]Nice.
[179:29.28]What an idiot.
[179:30.54]They could have won this.
[179:31.30]They had it right there.
[179:32.04]They had it in the bag.
[179:32.74]They couldn't win it because I was here.
[179:37.32]True.
[179:39.43]I wasn't going to make the archers.
[179:46.70]I'll revive these quicker I return from the dead hold on stay alive I can go like this yo are you the lightning guy I have lightning on my staff why do you get to be the frost fire lightning wizard there are enemies you can just you could just use the stick
[180:27.88]I do literally so easy.
[180:35.15]Ooh, we can make knights.
[180:37.35]Knights?
[180:38.15]You could probably do a whole... You could do like a whole chessboard.
[180:40.91]Is this like the power sword?
[180:50.18]Who is the... I want the flame thing.
[180:58.22]well I'm gonna upgrade this scorcher I'm gonna save my points giant killer beehive tree oh I didn't okay you need to like let me know when you're gonna skip
[181:22.35]I keep forgetting.
[181:23.49]I have no control over it and you just don't like me.
[181:26.70]Period.
[181:27.60]I keep forgetting that's not already up.
[181:28.78]I keep thinking it's already up.
[181:30.04]Is this a bigger spike wall?
[181:30.76]I think that one swivels out, like spins out.
[181:51.10]to create armies and hit things and push them back time we've got this how does this work this is like supposed to be a fire does it I don't know what direction is this the right direction I don't know I don't know a friend alright so I don't know how we gotta figure out what we want to do here yeah what are we gonna do
[182:16.32]I'm gonna build ladies yes but I'm making barricades and I didn't know where they should go um looks like I mean down here where do the stairs go oh there's a whole second floor man and it's complicated it's like a it's like a hitman level
[182:41.82]There's two paths.
[182:44.13]Like a hitman level, man.
[182:47.97]What do you say that for a change of pace, we defend here and then defend outward rather than make a barricade?
[182:59.40]So you mean... We could just barricade one path.
[183:02.64]Barricade a path and then go for it from there?
[183:04.64]No, I was talking about the opposite.
[183:06.38]Let's make this the kill room of death.
[183:08.74]Okay, this is the kill room.
[183:10.53]Yeah.
[183:10.73]Yeah.
[183:11.88]I feel like that's kind of scary considering how close we are to the thing.
[183:17.82]I'm not afraid.
[183:18.46]Are you afraid?
[183:20.06]Maybe a little.
[183:21.65]I want you to be a little bit.
[183:22.93]Wait, can't we put it on hard mode?
[183:24.07]They were saying.
[183:24.49]Do you think we're ready for that right now?
[183:28.27]I think we're ready for that right now.
[183:29.25]Alright.
[183:31.51]How about this?
[183:31.95]Do you want to take like a BRB and go pee?
[183:33.59]Get like some water and come out and put it in hard mode?

[189:41.63]Ster will be playing his choice of Five Nights at Freddy's 1 or Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[189:51.46]This will be determined by a poll in STR's chat.
[189:59.23]Is this a lie?

[190:13.98]To put the difficulty?
[190:14.98]Okay.
[190:17.70]Yeah, we have to remake the game because we have the wrong difficulty.
[190:21.89]Do you actually want to play this on hard?
[190:24.65]Okay, well then let me re-invite you.
[190:28.70]Oh, they can't hear you.
[190:30.10]I keep doing that.
[190:32.88]You should really just trust me.
[190:35.54]You should, like, not feel like you need to...
[190:39.93]Like, I don't know.
[190:41.27]So, we're on War Mage right now.
[190:45.45]Yeah.
[190:45.97]We are moving to Rift Lord, which is enemies are stronger, there's less time between waves, they carry shields, and we have half as many rift points.
[190:55.90]So, instead of 20, we'll have 10.
[190:56.96]Okay.
[190:59.31]Okay?
[190:59.89]Alright, now let me get you invited.
[191:02.31]I think I'm still with you.
[191:07.80]You are.
[191:08.90]Okay.
[191:09.20]And yeah, we can see that the bomber guys are on this stage.
[191:13.74]Oh.
[191:15.63]Okay.
[191:15.83]Well, let's get our ass kicked.
[191:18.05]No, we're going to do great.
[191:19.35]We're going to rise to the occasion and we're going to kill guys with your guns.
[191:31.72]So actually, which one should Ster play?
[191:35.30]First one or the second one?
[191:37.84]I would say two, right?
[191:41.84]I may have them both, so I don't know.
[191:49.01]So, uh, what was the point of that story again?
[191:52.85]The gigantic orc army's genius?
[191:55.73]They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus and Vorwick.
[191:59.31]And now, they're back.
[192:01.92]What?
[192:03.34]What?
[192:04.40]Why are you yelling?
[192:06.48]Oh, I'm just scratching my chest.
[192:11.12]Okay.
[192:12.62]I'm, I'm same strat.
[192:16.16]We're not going to do a snake.
[192:17.90]Okay.
[192:18.40]I just wanted to, they were talking.
[192:19.48]So same strat.
[192:21.86]So we're just going to, I'm building up here on one side.
[192:25.61]You build on the other side, the other door, this door.
[192:29.95]And we're just going... You handle the hot corner, I'll handle my corner.
[192:34.02]And this is just... Whoever is doing better wins.
[192:39.62]I don't know what direction this needs to face.
[192:45.35]Do you face grill out or grill... Grill in or grill out?
[192:51.77]I don't think you should call them that.
[192:54.27]It's grill out.
[192:54.97]Oh.
[192:57.95]It's this way.
[192:59.47]The grill shoots the fire out.
[193:00.71]Okay, I wonder what the range is.
[193:02.47]We'll find out.
[193:06.03]I don't know.
[193:07.15]It's hard to say.
[193:09.04]I'll figure it out.
[193:11.50]Okay, I'm ready.
[193:17.05]Okay, ready.
[193:18.59]This is what this game is.
[193:19.83]I had no idea this looked fun.
[193:20.89]Yeah, it is fun.
[193:23.22]This is more like the first and second game.
[193:27.18]Although, I don't remember.
[193:28.02]I could be just making that up.
[193:29.10]No, it's about the same.
[193:29.98]Oh, they do have shields.
[193:30.74]They do exist.
[193:59.12]Wow.
[194:04.30]We're really hurting these enemies.
[194:15.77]Oh.
[194:16.49]Oh.
[194:23.99]See, we didn't even need traps this level.
[194:26.79]I mean, this big guy getting through.
[194:32.55]There is?
[194:34.82]What?
[194:35.60]We lost one.
[194:36.30]I think a runner got by.
[194:37.46]Oh, we don't get to say I'm ready.
[194:41.12]We just have to do it.
[194:43.48]Are you serious?
[194:47.58]Oh, wait, there's a werewolf!
[194:51.10]You thought I was going to do it.
[194:57.05]There's a lot of big ones coming.
[195:00.61]That's a scary wolf.
[195:09.99]Okay.
[195:12.35]Not as scary as I... You gotta... Okay, this is... This is a little spooky.
[195:22.37]I got this under control.
[195:23.23]Don't worry.
[195:24.87]The barricade is under the barricade is down.
[195:29.87]Do you?
[195:30.19]Oh, they destroyed the barricade.
[195:32.75]Alright, now you die.
[195:42.56]I think you're letting a few through friend.
[195:49.15]I was dealing with something very important.
[195:51.17]I think this may be like a reset scenario.
[195:53.71]No, no, no.
[195:54.09]We're fine.
[195:54.85]We're fine.
[195:55.91]Everything is fine.
[195:57.25]They're almost there.
[196:03.62]We threw for the bit.
[196:04.80]No better place than this.
[196:07.76]Yeah.
[196:08.60]It's a regular Wednesday.
[196:09.88]Okay.
[196:11.94]There are enemies in our rift room.
[196:22.89]No, what?
[196:24.63]Okay.
[196:30.03]Okay.
[196:31.25]Not another guy's getting through.
[196:33.48]Am I right?
[196:35.72]You're right.
[196:51.26]I think three more I think this is a reset I think we learned we did we learned we learned let him in let him in we learned let him in I don't think this even attacked anyone nobody even came through here stop them quickly oh I thought we were doing I thought we were dancing
[197:19.99]We can't.
[197:20.80]Oh, it's on you, I guess.
[197:23.66]Alright.
[197:24.12]New strategy.
[197:24.62]Mm hmm.
[197:28.96]I think we've got to actually block a path.
[197:30.72]I think so too.
[197:31.96]So are we looking at... Let's just block this side here.
[197:34.48]Yeah.
[197:34.66]Okay.
[197:35.10]So now we deal with this.
[197:36.56]Should I funnel them with more blocks?
[197:56.07]or no because eventually they are going to be able to destroy those so we can't completely rely on that wait wait wait wait let's trap it okay yeah and eventually we should sell all that hold on sell all of this we need to block further down hmm
[198:28.20]don't slow somewhere you're not attacking yeah that's true then for now let's focus on defending this stair okay so we have um we should probably get a little bit of a walk here this because that's that's cutting the corner there so let's go right here
[198:50.89]OK, first wave wasn't very hard either.
[198:54.04]I think we're good.
[198:56.26]I think I might have missed something.
[199:00.94]So you want to fight up here, right?
[199:02.70]Yeah.
[199:03.88]Just double checking.
[199:06.10]Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.
[199:08.84]The door is down.
[199:10.60]Sponsor stream, what?
[199:17.65]You thought two bros can't have fun in the game together?
[199:28.81]They instantly broke it.
[199:30.73]They did.
[199:33.24]It's probably one of the kobolds.
[199:36.36]Yeah.
[199:37.42]Do you have like an instant retry thing we can do or do we have to let them beat us?
[199:43.22]I can just go like this.
[199:46.87]This wasn't in the book.
[199:50.41]In that case, original plan.
[199:53.77]Let's defend the final room.
[199:56.29]And then as we get more money, we build out.
[199:59.92]Not long after
[200:02.04]We need just damage, damage, damage them.
[200:03.77]There were rumors that Master Cygnus banished him from the Order, afraid of what he might do.
[200:09.39]What's the highest damage Cygnus?
[200:10.51]What was the point of that story again?
[200:12.65]The gigantic orc army's genius?
[200:15.53]They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus.
[200:17.73]Poison?
[200:18.15]I'm kind of afraid to use poison because it won't last long enough, right?
[200:20.99]Kelsey has it right.
[200:22.67]These new red rifts are bringing smaller orc factions together to create armies not seen since Vorwick's time.
[200:30.19]Alright, that's all I can do on this side.
[200:33.62]So we have to put shit here.
[200:36.80]And then they're going to eventually, they're going to come through here.
[200:48.49]Rotate the jump pads.
[200:51.57]These are fire flame pads.
[200:54.19]So they shoot fire up.
[201:02.27]It's backwards?
[201:02.91]Is it, though?
[201:06.88]You good?
[201:08.80]What do these fire things do?
[201:11.96]When people get close enough, it lifts up and breathes fire in their face.
[201:16.61]And the slow trap increases fire damage taken.
[201:22.04]And I don't know if I have it the right way or not, but people were saying grill out.
[201:27.40]I imagine the way the arrow is pointing.
[201:30.20]That's what I thought too.
[201:31.14]But if I spin it the other way, the grill is facing the other direction.
[201:36.48]That looks right.
[201:37.20]That looks right, I believe.
[201:39.10]We'll find out.
[201:40.36]Okay, we'll find out.
[201:41.16]Just know that we can't like sell in between rounds anymore.
[201:44.55]Because there's no in between rounds.
[201:47.61]So it better be right.
[201:48.73]It better be freaking right.
[201:50.99]Let's go.
[201:56.29]Yo, let's get it.
[201:57.08]So the game is hard.
[202:04.90]The game is challenging.
[202:06.54]They're going the other way.
[202:07.75]We got to go back up.
[202:30.10]No, that's correct.
[202:31.08]I want to make sure it's right.
[202:33.26]Okay.
[202:38.99]I think they're getting up the other way.
[202:41.73]They are.
[202:42.77]There are enemies in our rift room.
[202:48.93]Don't let them do it.
[202:50.28]I got it.
[202:50.58]I got it.
[202:53.34]I will be rift room protector for now.
[202:56.44]Okay.
[202:56.64]Okay.
[202:57.56]I will be out in the world trying to thin the herd as possible as much.
[203:17.77]If you're having trouble, let me know.
[203:21.15]I'm okay for now, but I imagine in about five seconds that will change.
[203:26.87]there's also like teleport back to the room trinkets that you can buy that I just never bought because it was easy before this we're okay so far okay I'm imagining we need some of this right here
[203:50.90]Our enemies are breaking through elsewhere!
[203:54.08]Look out!
[203:54.80]Our defenses have been breached again!
[204:01.24]Spray fire!
[204:01.90]What are you doing?
[204:02.96]Oh, it's the wrong way!
[204:04.39]Oh my god.
[204:05.09]I got so in my own head.
[204:06.07]Uh-oh.
[204:09.07]Oh, shoot.
[204:09.87]Uh-oh.
[204:18.45]Uh-oh.
[204:27.94]Uh-oh.
[204:39.31]We're good.
[204:39.79]We're okay.
[204:46.61]This map, it is hard to tell where everything is because it all goes over top of each other.
[204:54.35]They're almost there.
[205:06.40]I wonder if I can spin that around in the next like 3, 2, 1.
[205:10.34]There's a lot of people in here.
[205:22.40]If you're not busy, I think I got it.
[205:25.10]Big guy coming.
[205:38.36]Meth Lord.
[205:50.29]Enemies at the Rift.
[205:51.67]There we go.
[205:52.09]Okay.
[205:52.29]At least one of them is right.
[205:58.79]Why is it not shooting?
[206:00.25]Pure gamer face.
[206:03.27]What's going on with this thing?
[206:08.50]There are enemies in our rift room.
[206:11.12]This guy needs to shut up about them being in our rift room.
[206:15.42]He is not matching the vibe.
[206:16.98]That's a long cooldown.
[206:19.06]God damn it.
[206:19.64]I had a chance.
[206:20.66]That was two seconds.
[206:21.82]More enemies on the way.
[206:28.95]Oh, it gives you like two seconds to sell.
[206:32.01]Yeah, that was not very much time at all.
[206:36.29]What is the yellow on the minimap?
[206:39.72]Oh, it's all these things.
[206:41.02]Those sappers will go straight for barricades.
[206:44.32]Alright, so the yellow on the minimap, that's good.
[206:49.24]Nice.
[206:55.75]They're almost there.
[207:01.81]Oh, boy.
[207:02.17]Hello, running out of mana.
[207:11.39]They're a little spooky or anything.
[207:24.80]Enemies at the Rift.
[207:26.93]Could be way worse.
[207:43.65]Yeah, your tar trap that's actually set up the right way is doing a lot over here.
[207:47.15]There are enemies in our rift room.
[207:51.00]Oh, you need help.
[207:51.74]There's a lot of big guys coming over here too.
[207:53.78]They're almost there.
[208:14.79]Yeah, this isn't a bad strat, but it's scary.
[208:16.53]Oh, one got in.
[208:19.70]Really?
[208:20.60]I didn't see him.
[208:22.30]Oh, shit.
[208:22.56]It was a cheater, though, so don't even worry about it.
[208:24.34]He was just cheating.
[208:36.09]He really is saying that every three seconds.
[208:39.81]Oh, I can tell you this much.
[208:41.49]There's enemies in our rift room.
[208:49.63]Chill!
[208:53.73]In case you didn't know!
[208:54.65]I got it.
[209:02.18]Thank goodness.
[209:03.24]Uh, I'm gonna... If it was going the right way, it'd be good.
[209:13.68]Alright, this room should be pretty protected.
[209:15.16]Guys, I think there's enemies in the rift room.
[209:32.22]I feel like there are.
[209:42.24]gonna keep stat like I really feel like I could just keep building archers in this room and just keep freezing stuff maybe I don't know what just happened I wonder if we should build a barricade like in the corner as like they they go after the archers like no matter what
[210:09.37]Okay, there is a lot of guys coming.
[210:11.31]Yeah.
[210:15.03]This is pretty well defended, though, over here.
[210:18.76]I think we'll be alright.
[210:21.86]I need the sword.
[210:24.54]I wonder if the broadsword's any good.
[210:25.74]This thing's great.
[210:27.59]Sounded good.
[210:29.19]Okay.
[210:38.71]I missed a raid from Sips earlier.
[210:42.72]You're still here from Sips, right?
[210:46.90]Thanks, everybody.
[210:48.16]I don't know if you're still here or not, but missed it.
[210:54.59]Oh, shit.
[210:54.99]Oh, shit.
[210:56.19]Oh, that's bad.
[210:57.09]Sorry.
[211:03.19]They're still only halfway.
[211:05.69]Well, we are halfway through the level, so we just.
[211:08.99]Yes, because these barricades got blown up and I got to spend all my money remaking them.
[211:12.53]They're almost there.
[211:36.87]Uh, I got it.
[211:37.81]Oh, put this back.
[211:40.13]Uh, we're going to go like this.
[211:41.23]More enemies on the way.
[211:43.72]Enemies are attacking on another front.
[211:46.76]Watch out.
[211:47.90]Our enemies have broken through again.
[211:50.28]Where?
[211:51.12]I don't know.
[211:52.36]This guy is freaking me out.
[211:53.72]Okay, where are they?
[211:55.32]Oh, they're going up this way.
[211:58.34]They're going up this left side.
[212:05.15]Hold it.
[212:10.46]I don't think I have any of my traps upgraded this low full upgrade is very useful now this is fun I like this I like want to play more yeah I I like sense you being like oh let's play five minutes of pretties now no no no no no no
[212:39.91]No, no, I'm good.
[212:40.67]This is fun.
[212:52.54]You can play Five Nights at Freddy's in Roblox.
[212:54.92]You can play.
[212:55.38]You can do anything in Roblox.
[213:00.67]I don't know what I would be doing without the free.
[213:19.37]enemies at the rift the baritone is under attack just this hallway that's it nothing else low on mana
[213:36.94]It does show the bombers coming in yellow.
[213:39.00]No problem.
[213:41.52]I still don't know what this plant actually does.
[213:45.06]It's confusion.
[213:47.40]It looks like it was making them walk backwards there.
[213:49.47]I don't know if they were chasing me or confused.
[213:53.11]Oh, next wave.
[213:54.65]More enemies on the way.
[214:09.86]I'm gonna go the other way.
[214:10.74]Yeah.
[214:19.01]Jimmy, you fucked it up.
[214:20.49]I'm alright.
[214:22.17]Hey, all that matters is that they die.
[214:24.03]It doesn't matter how cleanly it is.
[214:25.41]There are enemies in our rift room.
[214:29.16]There are?
[214:29.62]Okay.
[214:30.48]Yeah.
[214:31.48]Yeah, there are.
[214:32.22]Whoa!
[214:32.96]Whoa!
[214:45.07]You good?
[214:47.37]Vaguely.
[214:47.79]There's a lot of people over here.
[214:52.89]Not good, not good, not good.
[214:54.21]Not good?
[214:56.06]Oh, not good.
[214:57.14]A few got in.
[214:57.80]We got to rebuild this barricade.
[215:03.60]We got another barricade to rebuild.
[215:05.84]No better place than this.
[215:08.59]Enemies at the rift.
[215:18.70]I got you.
[215:24.14]Man, if I was an orc, I really hope I'm a heavy orc.
[215:30.89]VOD watchers are smelly?
[215:35.11]Why would you say that?
[215:35.95]No!
[215:36.59]No!
[215:37.07]What happened?
[215:38.71]The fucking elementals just walk by everything.
[215:42.50]The little tiny elementals kept getting by.
[215:44.52]Shit.
[215:49.08]Yeah, that was hard.
[215:51.98]Yeah.
[215:55.93]Yeah, it was.
[215:59.01]We going again?
[216:02.61]Yeah, hold on, let me buy.
[216:03.73]OK, I got I got what I needed.
[216:14.94]I feel like I want to refund points.
[216:17.82]He wants to refund the game.
[216:19.16]I thought you just said you liked it.
[216:22.16]I think I want to refund the game.
[216:25.19]You know, that makes sense because we've just been buying experimental stuff.
[216:30.29]It doesn't refund the stuff that you bought.
[216:33.43]just the upgrades for him uh it's alright after that battle vorwick disappeared there were rumors they were coming up close on the two hour mark if we could refund real quick it's been way longer than two hours so like four what's the point of that story again the gigantic orc army's genius they haven't been seen since the days of master cygnus and borway what are we missing they're back kelsey has it right
[216:59.68]What do we need?
[217:00.52]I am... You have tar.
[217:05.34]I'm going to not buy shit you already have.
[217:08.23]Tar.
[217:11.07]I got these brimstone tiles.
[217:12.41]I'm going to put it at the beginning because it's damage over time.
[217:15.29]So by the time they get to us, hopefully they're less strong.
[217:20.06]And I got the sword.
[217:22.08]Oh, you got the sword.
[217:22.66]Okay.
[217:23.86]I feel like you're going to like it.
[217:32.03]Get crit canteens?
[217:33.27]Okay, I'm ready.
[217:37.45]Are we ready?
[217:37.87]Are we changing strategy?
[217:40.91]Are we keeping the same thing going?
[217:42.05]Are we going back to the rift room?
[217:43.23]Are we going to enemies in the rift room?
[217:44.74]I don't know.
[217:45.26]I'm putting fire down at the front.
[217:48.80]We could just front door and just kill them as they come.
[217:51.92]But then once the side door is open, we got to change strategy.
[217:55.48]Yeah.
[217:57.85]Yeah, delete those.
[218:00.65]Why?
[218:01.07]Because I want to put the slow traps first.
[218:03.76]Because now they take more fire damage.
[218:11.62]okay and then logic and then after they go through the fire let's hit them with the poison let's say they'll turn this way and let's fuck them up uh do you do we know if the uh the bombers only destroy barricades if they're blocking their path or if like I think they probably just run right through a barricade okay
[218:35.31]it almost seems here like with these pouring things that you would want them to walk around this so you can actually make use out of it but if you put a barricade here they're going to instantly just blow it up I wonder if maybe we just have to be really diligent about when they spawn enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates they've broken through a gate
[219:08.67]Okay, yeah, I like this better already.
[219:12.82]This sword is really good.
[219:15.50]Crossword?
[219:16.70]Yeah.
[219:17.44]What is its ability?
[219:19.32]I put down the lightning sword.
[219:21.73]Hold up.
[219:22.21]Stop hitting them.
[219:25.93]Ooh.
[219:27.95]It's nice.
[219:29.43]Yeah, but all I had was the bow, so when they all grouped up, I didn't have anything to shoot them.
[219:43.45]Alright, look at that.
[219:44.13]We're good.
[219:44.73]I'm gonna do some more poison.
[219:48.45]What?
[219:49.69]I don't think we did it.
[219:51.91]We lost?
[219:53.73]Who?
[219:55.07]We two got in.
[219:56.39]Shit, and they're coming through this way.
[219:57.71]We have no defense over here.
[220:02.24]Well, uh...
[220:05.53]I don't like the noises my guy makes when he gets hurt.
[220:35.43]Oh, also the trinkets to like teleport back to the end.
[220:37.79]I think there's something we need.
[220:39.01]Someone needs to have that.
[220:40.17]Yeah.
[220:47.15]Somebody is getting in there.
[220:48.25]They're almost there.
[220:57.93]Yeah, I don't know.
[220:58.57]It looks like the maybe the strategy is to fall back a little bit to the room.
[221:02.09]But that's the first we got without any problems.
[221:05.52]I think we're still good.
[221:06.44]I just wanted to put the fire at the beginning so that they like take a lot of damage by the time they get here.
[221:10.48]Yeah.
[221:13.48]OK, we need to come back to the restroom.
[221:18.86]I'm dead.
[221:19.20]Yeah.
[221:19.32]I don't know where you were.
[221:21.11]Yeah, it's over.
[221:23.15]Okay, I'm going to let him.
[221:24.93]Just restart.
[221:25.47]I thought that was in the game.
[221:37.06]No, I thought that was one of our characters.
[221:38.60]I thought that was my character.
[221:41.36]Let us do Gambo?
[221:43.53]I think those are doubters that want to gamble.
[221:54.97]An easy way to make all my points back.
[221:57.96]Easiest win?
[221:58.54]Yeah.
[221:58.74]I just thought about... I just got like a flash in my brain of you with like a facecam.
[222:03.44]And like...
[222:23.95]And you being like, what the fuck?
[222:25.29]I can't wait.
[222:25.81]I can't.
[222:26.15]It's gonna be so fucking funny.
[222:28.47]What are you talking about?
[222:34.86]Oh, for five nights is for, okay.
[222:36.51]So he does want to quit.
[222:37.91]No, no, no, no.
[222:38.91]I just like, I just got like a huge, I don't know.
[222:41.13]I got like a, a YouTube video image in my brain of you sitting there and the camera zooming in really close after the, uh, after you get scared and being like, what the hell?
[222:52.71]Where did it even come from?
[222:53.87]You know, like a zoom in quick.
[222:54.85]Okay.
[222:57.06]This is going to be one of the most viewed videos on your YouTube, by the way.
[223:01.92]Is it?
[223:02.68]Is it really?
[223:03.32]Yeah.
[223:04.30]Okay.
[223:06.84]You have streams cut up, right?
[223:08.82]You cut up streams and put them up?
[223:10.90]Yep.
[223:11.44]Can I make my own little bet here?
[223:13.93]Your own bet.
[223:14.57]Ster plays Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[223:17.15]We'll have at least 10-20% more views than every video on that channel.
[223:21.57]Is it going to be my crowning achievement?
[223:23.63]I think so.
[223:27.20]At least 10%.
[223:29.32]And if I win the bet, you ready up.
[223:33.36]But I'm scared.
[223:34.00]I haven't put anything down.
[223:35.54]I don't know what the strategy we're doing.
[223:40.06]I think it wants us to do this so bad.
[223:42.94]This is what we had before.
[223:44.94]Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.
[223:48.17]The door is down.
[224:01.67]Feel like I'm playing 40k.
[224:07.35]Same gameplay loop.
[224:09.86]Power stored, nothing else.
[224:25.42]Mine launches them though, so I have CC.
[224:32.75]This will get him off guard.
[224:41.97]Enemies are attacking on another front.
[224:45.05]Watch out.
[224:46.41]Enemies have broken through again.
[224:49.42]Here they come.
[224:50.02]Alright.
[224:51.70]Now are we falling back on backwards?
[224:54.92]We'll fight these guys.
[224:55.58]He's the only guys on the map at the moment.
[224:57.18]The barricade is down.
[225:04.18]Okay, now there's more guys.
[225:05.31]Okay, they're all coming this way.
[225:07.07]We're good here.
[225:07.71]We're good here.
[225:08.25]Yep.
[225:08.95]Keep the communication.
[225:09.95]We're good.
[225:10.29]We're good.
[225:10.83]We're good.
[225:21.96]They already destroyed that one little barricade I put there.
[225:26.84]I'm dead.
[225:27.24]It's fine because you respawn in the rift room, which is actually helpful.
[225:31.74]Dude, we need you.
[225:36.80]I'm gonna die too.
[225:45.71]Wow, they do deal a lot of damage now.
[225:47.99]They do.
[225:52.77]Oh, I may have put this on wrong and it's gonna shoot them.
[225:55.24]Yeah, I did the same thing downstairs.
[225:58.88]No!
[225:59.40]Oh!
[226:09.39]I wonder if upgrading the heal is a good idea.
[226:10.91]I wonder what it does.
[226:11.43]Because it's healing us like full health.
[226:14.77]What would an upgraded heal do?
[226:15.91]Maybe it's like a buff?
[226:19.91]Maybe make you even more healed.
[226:23.57]Shorter cooldown.
[226:24.51]Oh, that's bad.
[226:29.23]I can't believe only one got in there.
[226:38.39]I wish I could spin this alright we got we got um the bomb uh cobalt things those sappers will go straight for barricades so they're fast and they have bombs on their backs
[227:11.69]hey dude I've been counting you've done three you've done 300 lip bites jump up they they're getting in I think I think defender rift room was the strat I think it is too much going on on this map
[227:38.47]Hey, we could be cowards and turn it back down.
[227:42.95]Are you a little baby?
[227:43.97]Are you like a little child?
[227:46.39]It's technically not over yet.
[228:18.27]No, they're not.
[228:21.69]It's always just one small elemental just goes right by.
[228:27.90]Reset.
[228:28.66]Reset.
[228:29.58]Reset?
[228:30.58]Reset.
[228:31.12]We got it this time.
[228:32.02]Defend the Rift Room.
[228:33.70]Easy.
[228:34.34]But we're... We almost got it.
[228:36.68]No, we... No, trust... We got this next one.
[228:40.32]Believers?
[228:42.03]Believers?
[228:42.51]Go all in, Believers.
[228:44.75]Oh.
[228:44.83]Oh.
[228:47.38]Are you sure about that?
[228:48.24]I'm positive.
[228:53.04]I know it needs to be done.
[228:56.86]Okay.
[228:57.70]Are you sure?
[228:58.14]I'm positive.
[229:02.78]Alright.
[229:04.81]I'm positive.
[229:05.19]I'm going to take the barricade off my bar.
[229:08.71]No barricades.
[229:09.95]Just damage.
[229:14.39]And we're only being Rift Room Andes.
[229:17.21]I think Barricade's only at the end so we can defend them.
[229:23.10]Rift Room Andes.
[229:25.16]So do you want to just pick a side and I'll fortify one and you fortify the other and then we'll eventually come into the middle?
[229:31.62]There's three sides.
[229:32.82]Yeah, but they don't start coming down here until later.
[229:37.62]It's the left and right rooms first.
[229:40.08]Are you taking the left side?
[229:42.66]Okay.
[229:43.20]I will fortify this right side.
[229:44.66]This time I'm not going to mess this up.
[229:46.86]I'm ready.
[229:47.24]Oh yeah, I'm ready.
[230:07.63]I'm doubting this time.
[230:08.67]Oh shit.
[230:09.29]OK, there's a lot of doubters.
[230:11.25]I'm going to.
[230:11.57]What's the ratio here?
[230:14.81]Actually, no, it's pretty even never mind.
[230:19.37]Fine is believers.
[230:20.79]They want people believing in your chat, yeah?
[230:35.06]Honest to goodness, let's game.
[230:36.42]Let's game.
[230:38.08]I just hear... You're dead.
[230:56.08]Do you lose money if you die?
[230:57.24]I don't know.
[230:58.20]I kind of did die on... Oh, no.
[231:00.80]The believers...
[231:04.05]I want it.
[231:04.39]I want it to come back quick.
[231:17.52]This map has me paranoid.
[231:32.94]Paranoid.
[231:35.37]enemies at the rift so is there only one level in this game or what streamer just have only seen I've been watching for a while and I've only seen this one level oh right
[232:03.33]there are enemies in our rift room what there are no we're okay they're coming down the middle now I turn around to deal with your problem we don't need to defend the middle walks down the
[232:31.27]I don't even know what you said, but you scared me.
[232:35.89]There was a rat.
[232:37.17]Bro, what?
[232:37.61]I don't know what to do.
[232:38.21]Coming up the middle.
[233:07.59]Alright, now we focus a little bit of building in the mid.
[233:12.63]That hurts.
[233:13.33]There are enemies in our rift room.
[233:30.66]I think there's some element of like dealing the correct damage types to certain enemies we're missing.
[233:36.54]Yes, that is a good point.
[233:39.15]I feel like if you're on hard, you need to do that 100%.
[233:42.09]Alright, still the middle.
[233:49.09]They're coming from your way.
[233:50.13]Yep.
[233:50.42]I'll handle this in here.
[234:00.93]there's a lot and I'm I'm getting hurt this big guy over here there's a lot in the room I'm having some trouble he got me he outplayed me
[234:30.17]Okay, not another one's getting through.
[234:32.79]Are you sure?
[234:36.57]I'm sure.
[234:46.40]Positive.
[234:48.12]Alright, we have a second here after this.
[234:55.12]We have one second.
[234:57.31]Enemies in my rift room.
[234:58.67]More likely than they think.
[234:59.89]Free PC check.
[235:00.95]What?
[235:01.63]Why would I?
[235:02.09]I just got so distracted by that.
[235:03.79]Yeah, you let one in.
[235:05.01]I said no more and you let one in.
[235:06.43]The mods posted something funny.
[235:11.59]Okay.
[235:12.65]I see how it is.
[235:14.08]We just let them into our rift now.
[235:18.62]Okay, watch out for these bombers.
[235:20.94]Oh, they walk over this fire trap and they just blow up.
[235:24.22]really okay don't let them blow up on you nice but yeah they insta died on the fire maybe we just put those out in front of all every door that makes um I'm so tired and owned from saying this
[235:51.20]Exhausted.
[235:52.50]Can we please deal with these enemies in the rift?
[235:56.06]Kind of sounds like the principle from Beavis and Butthead.
[236:00.27]It does.
[236:01.47]Oh, Beavis and Butthead!
[236:04.07]You're both expelled!
[236:07.61]Every episode expelled.
[236:09.97]They get expelled.
[236:11.61]Like every, yeah, every episode.
[236:13.80]There are enemies in our rift room!
[236:15.68]Oh!
[236:25.85]I love the old man voice.
[236:28.57]It's so classic.
[236:31.68]Everybody's got one.
[236:33.60]And it varies, right?
[236:35.58]What is your old man voice?
[236:38.41]It's Deckard Cain.
[236:39.83]Yep.
[236:40.97]There's...
[236:43.11]Oh, I'm an old man.
[236:45.21]Like I do that one sometimes.
[236:47.19]It's also the one with a little more, a little more indecisiveness road area.
[236:53.03]Are you going to talk like that when you're an old man?
[236:55.44]Honestly, probably.
[236:58.26]I feel like I talk like that now sometimes, honestly.
[237:00.30]They're almost in the restroom.
[237:05.10]Fucker.
[237:08.07]There's air, lots of air in this one.
[237:16.74]You can combine them even if you want to.
[237:18.98]The one that's more in the throat can also be used with the one that's more airy.
[237:26.91]I am focused on this.
[237:31.23]I'm sorry.
[237:32.11]I'm sorry about the bit.
[237:33.43]The bit.
[237:34.17]Enemies at the rift.
[237:35.69]I'm not focused on the bit.
[237:37.27]Where am I going to lose?
[237:39.13]I know.
[237:39.61]I don't have the coins.
[237:46.79]I know.
[237:47.17]The outer is salivating right now.
[237:50.92]We were going to win.
[237:52.63]We were not going to win.
[237:53.89]And then there was a bit.
[237:55.85]I didn't know there was going to be a bit.
[237:57.73]There was no bit.
[237:58.85]We were dead from the last five minutes we were done.
[238:05.27]I leaned in and went, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[238:08.98]This trinket.
[238:10.78]Equipping increases Rift Points, makes enemies worth zero Rift Points for a short time if used.
[238:18.19]You can just stand next to the rift when you see those guys.
[238:20.01]Like, oh, there's a whole bunch of... Just cast your empty rift.
[238:23.89]What?
[238:26.67]That's insane.
[238:27.73]We're missing a whole thing here.
[238:34.21]And then there's the Ring of Storms, which defends the rift.
[238:38.53]I'm refunding all my upgrades.
[238:40.77]I am purchasing the Ring of Storms.
[238:49.52]And I'm going to use it.
[238:55.76]I don't know how you feel about that.
[239:00.01]I think, yeah.
[239:01.89]What are some of those... One very important question.
[239:05.55]Is there a kind of list of enemies we can look at?
[239:08.09]Like a... Is it like a tome or something we can open that shows enemies and what their damage types are and everything?
[239:19.35]Because we need to find out what is hurting the elementals, whatever they are.
[239:22.91]The Earth ones the most.
[239:27.58]I don't see it anywhere.
[239:28.68]Get Jar of Ghosts 100%.
[239:33.70]Yeah, we need... We gotta... There's gotta be a new strategy here.
[239:41.88]enemies that hit the player to run away enemies turn and run away so it's like a fear arcane and lightning is what you want so maybe I'll get the arcane staff yeah we had nothing that was arcane long range I have brimstone floor deals arcane damage I didn't even know there was an arcane I'll I'll get the arcane staff staff's real good
[240:12.73]so I need to hurt things with this so I got that upgraded I will use that as a weapon and then what about the grinder I I just got the grinder okay and you can hit me off on grinder if you want alright but priestess the priestess is arcane okay okay
[240:42.86]Do you want it just to be arcane?
[240:46.22]Just do a ton of arcane damage with these priestesses?
[240:50.61]On priestess, it says war scenario only.
[240:53.03]Oh, shit.
[240:53.47]Okay.
[240:54.11]There's a few of those.
[240:54.97]I wanted to get those before.
[240:56.19]Tornado in a box.
[240:59.89]War scenario only.
[241:00.88]Maybe we should... Can you toggle something to make it so you don't get... See them?
[241:06.65]I think push trap.
[241:07.67]We need some pushing.
[241:10.13]Ooh, snow cannon.
[241:11.09]Short-range cannon that freezes and damages enemies.
[241:14.93]This looks like it's on the ceiling.
[241:15.86]Is there a ceiling?
[241:19.84]I hope there's a ceiling.
[241:21.32]In the Rift Room, no, but there's only ceilings downstairs.
[241:27.96]Alright.
[241:28.16]I'm going to get it.
[241:28.94]I'm curious.
[241:29.36]I'm going to try it.
[241:35.20]Wind Belt.
[241:37.47]Short ranged AOE crowd control that pushes enemies.
[241:40.47]Secondary can be used.
[241:41.23]So this is a, I think this is like shooting.
[241:44.36]Is this like a weapon?
[241:46.88]Get Jar of Ghosts.
[241:47.58]Get Jar of Ghosts, please.
[241:48.40]Alright, I'll get Jar of Ghosts.
[241:53.46]Everyone's saying to get it.
[242:01.49]Increase passive fear duration.
[242:03.23]Okay.
[242:09.37]And then I got enough to do like one more or two more things.
[242:13.99]Window of butterflies.
[242:17.42]Distracting enemies.
[242:22.62]Deep freeze.
[242:23.48]I'm ready.
[242:24.83]Ooh.
[242:25.05]I kind of want this, but it's not on the ground.
[242:26.83]I need something on the ground.
[242:27.89]Ceiling lasers.
[242:28.71]No.
[242:34.52]I am so fucking ready.
[242:38.46]What do you have to make sure I can... I've got grinders.
[242:44.38]I've got archer ladies.
[242:46.58]I think I'm going to upgrade the spike wall, the big one that pushes them back.
[242:51.06]Yeah, that makes sense.
[242:53.40]We need some pushbacks.
[242:54.64]I upgraded the floor fire all the way.
[242:58.94]That seemed good against the bombers.
[243:01.62]Yep.
[243:02.52]And then maybe I'll do tar.
[243:06.05]Yeah, I got tar again.
[243:08.37]Enemies remain slowed for a brief time, or they take more fire damage.
[243:15.11]After they walk on it, they're still slow.
[243:18.69]Or enemies take increased fire damage on tar.
[243:24.49]Just keep it slow, maybe.
[243:25.55]I don't know, man.
[243:26.69]I don't know, dude.
[243:29.01]We got some shit here.
[243:30.09]Let's give it a try.
[243:38.17]I'm about to just like... You know what I mean?
[243:42.06]We need to... We need to redo this whole thing.
[243:46.09]There were rumors that Master Cygnus banished him from the order, afraid of what he might do.
[243:51.62]So?
[243:52.40]So, uh, what was the point of that story again?
[243:55.16]The gigantic orc army's genius?
[243:58.04]They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus and Vorwick.
[244:01.62]And now, they're back.
[244:03.51]Putting the fire traps on these corners, so when the runner boys come out, they'll probably just insta-die.
[244:11.45]All my shit is expensive.
[244:13.15]We've got this, sorceress.
[244:14.91]Let's trap it up.
[244:22.34]Let's trap it up.
[244:24.02]Yeah, she did.
[244:24.52]Okay.
[244:26.28]Alright, let me take a look at how this all works.
[244:35.81]Okay.
[244:39.13]Okay, so that's like an AoE.
[244:42.65]Let me see.
[244:43.21]So this has to go on a ceiling.
[244:45.43]Oh, push traps are really cheap.
[244:50.27]Are we doing rift room?
[244:55.07]Yeah.
[244:55.85]Okay.
[245:02.52]I wonder how much range these have because I could probably aim them into the room.
[245:12.48]Okay, so they're going to come this way.
[245:20.78]alright I got this is gonna be disgusting okay yeah and I have this turns the rift into like a lightning storm for one like shit's all getting close to it we're we're we're winning this one we like bought things you know what I mean I think we're good let's give it a try I got snow I got three expensive snow cannons right here aiming right and they're probably gonna be like
[245:55.95]See where they are?
[245:57.97]Yeah.
[245:58.71]I think that's a good spot.
[246:01.37]I want, so I can activate this, but it's a passive, but I can also activate it, and I think it's just a big fear.
[246:07.29]I wonder.
[246:07.57]Okay.
[246:07.95]Ooh!
[246:12.17]Come on!
[246:14.01]No!
[246:22.43]enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates they've broken through a gate this is like very bright yeah I just have like more damage on the sword and everything
[246:57.64]The enemy army is attacking on another front.
[247:00.88]Alright, follow back.
[247:11.89]Someone the other way.
[247:12.61]I have snow cannons over there.
[247:17.49]Okay, I'm back at the rift room to make sure.
[247:21.44]Okay, so are you.
[247:24.72]I really like the corner archer.
[247:26.16]Those snow cannons.
[247:28.16]Those snow cannons fucked them up, by the way.
[247:30.54]There's only like three people here.
[247:34.84]I'm going to load even more.
[247:36.18]I'm going to make this... This is just only snow cannons over here.
[247:43.02]Good luck getting through that.
[247:43.80]Oh, that's a fast one.
[247:49.63]Okay.
[247:50.41]Watch out!
[248:07.07]Okay, we gotta get back.
[248:07.93]They're almost there!
[248:15.39]They're in the room.
[248:22.49]Big or small, I can take them all down!
[248:29.07]enemies at the rift dude what the those little fire guys little firemen okay okay that was a cute
[248:58.47]I guess if they want to do that, that's cute.
[249:00.44]They can do that.
[249:01.04]Everybody gets one.
[249:05.42]Watch that.
[249:06.00]Right.
[249:06.42]Yeah, you got it.
[249:09.84]People in.
[249:10.96]People in.
[249:11.64]I died.
[249:29.23]more enemies in the rift okay I turned on the lightning rift I don't I barely saw it do anything there are enemies in our rift room we're okay
[250:04.19]That could have been way worse.
[250:14.14]This is a little sketchy so far.
[250:15.46]Could have been way worse.
[250:22.44]Dude, I can do that.
[250:42.91]Alright, they're coming through the middle.
[250:52.94]We have multiple elementals.
[251:02.62]They're almost there!
[251:03.88]Uh-oh, left side.
[251:05.42]Oh, fuck!
[251:05.86]Little fires, little fires, little fires.
[251:07.16]They're attacking American.
[251:09.02]Hello, running out of mana.
[251:14.35]We need some barricades up here.
[251:18.51]Anything so they don't just like walk in the street.
[251:20.89]Alright, let's let's regroup a little.
[251:26.96]There are enemies in our room.
[251:30.12]Oh, I see what's happening.
[251:30.98]I need to sell that shit, too.
[251:32.32]Fuck.
[251:41.53]Enemies at the Rift.
[251:42.45]Not happening.
[251:50.97]Why does this feel like the worst we've done?
[251:54.75]It definitely isn't, but it's up there.
[251:58.33]We still have seven.
[252:01.44]Alright, this wave's almost done.
[252:02.28]We gotta rethink the strategy here in a sec.
[252:07.04]Oh, I gotta sell this thing.
[252:10.10]When does the wave end?
[252:11.02]Like when they're all dead, you get a moment to sell?
[252:12.73]When they're all dead, yeah.
[252:16.09]What are you spamming this for?
[252:22.37]There are enemies in our room.
[252:28.73]Got a bandaid.
[252:37.15]OK, OK, OK, OK.
[252:40.79]I wish I had one second.
[252:42.97]Yeah, I really am.
[252:44.73]If I could sell one thing, it would help so much.
[252:47.54]Enemies at the rift.
[252:59.23]Use the tar.
[253:00.29]Yeah, I know, I know.
[253:02.94]Once we get one second here, we'll be alright.
[253:04.58]Alright, this is the opportunity.
[253:10.60]Okay.
[253:12.34]Woo!
[253:13.10]I, um... I'm gonna put some tar in the middle.
[253:25.95]Yeah, all the bombers are just blowing up.
[253:31.63]Yeah, they all died.
[253:32.41]I don't even have to look at them.
[253:33.29]So we can actually set up barricades in here.
[253:35.09]Do you have barricades?
[253:37.15]I don't on my bar, but I do.
[253:41.04]I'm going to focus on that then.
[253:48.28]Which way does it go?
[253:48.76]That way.
[253:51.46]Alright, they're coming up the other side.
[253:52.98]I'll take it this side.
[253:53.66]You go to the other side.
[253:56.21]Okay, okay
[254:29.35]I got to get a snow can up here.
[254:31.61]That would be nice.
[254:32.55]There's not a lot of feelings up here.
[254:35.32]There's a lot of people coming in.
[254:42.40]Behind us, too.
[254:43.46]Yeah, this is where it ends.
[254:46.45]Nope.
[254:54.09]Nope.
[254:57.70]Oh, good freeze.
[254:58.70]Good freeze.
[255:05.28]And I have whatever I still am not 100% sure I activate like super long cooldown for the rift.
[255:13.79]Enemies at the rift.
[255:21.27]It's only these two sides are now.
[255:22.51]I think we're OK.
[255:22.97]Alright, I got a snow cannon going up in a second.
[255:37.70]We can do it.
[255:41.20]This is actually the best we've done.
[255:42.54]We're actually doing alright.
[255:44.62]Yeah, I think that we're not worried about these barricades getting destroyed.
[255:48.07]It's only going to get a little easier.
[255:54.38]Okay, I got a bunch of snow over there.
[255:59.51]Alright, they're coming all the way.
[256:09.70]I think, yeah, the snow can- I got- Remember the snow cannons down here?
[256:11.98]Doing work.
[256:13.58]Yeah.
[256:20.36]That's so much damage.
[256:21.88]Holy shit.
[256:22.44]This board is good.
[256:32.57]Apparently.
[256:33.27]Why are they not shooting?
[256:35.25]Oh, okay.
[256:35.57]I was going to say, what's going on?
[256:36.95]Nice.
[256:48.94]Still only this way, so we're good.
[256:53.82]Could we... Was betting allowed here?
[256:55.60]Because I think we're... This is... This looks like this is the one.
[257:00.09]There's so much fucking ice.
[257:07.07]Yeah, I'm freezing them too.
[257:13.12]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[257:24.09]It's only wave five of eight still.
[257:38.90]I need more mana.
[257:40.12]They've destroyed a barricade.
[257:48.46]That spear actually, thank god.
[257:49.70]Oh!
[257:50.54]Uh oh, I'm dying.
[257:52.92]I just died too.
[257:57.36]It's alright, we're alright.
[258:00.06]I don't know who here destroyed my barricade.
[258:02.07]Something blew up and destroyed everything.
[258:03.75]Alright, where we going?
[258:10.79]There's plenty over here, but let me go like this.
[258:25.00]Alright, where we looking? Where we looking? Where we looking? Where we looking?
[258:28.00]Um, everywhere?
[258:28.33]Middle? Middle and- I'm gonna go middle. You stay on that side.
[258:33.33]I'm on the side where we were, I'm good over here. I think, I don't know this troll... I got them.
[258:45.00]You good?
[258:46.00]Yeah.
[258:47.00]Alright, they're coming on the right side now. You're in- they're in..
[258:55.55]Coms, coms, coms, coms, coms, coms.
[258:57.87]Watch out for the little firemen.
[259:06.95]Little firemen.
[259:13.45]Look guys, look guys.
[259:15.99]Damn, one got in.
[259:18.96]They got the barricade over here.
[259:34.98]I don't know what's causing that barricade to constantly blow up.
[259:37.76]I think they're just running up here.
[259:40.04]There are enemies in our rift room.
[259:41.84]Oh, there's so many.
[259:50.42]No, we were doing so good.
[259:51.44]There's so many.
[259:52.37]It's just an overwhelming amount of enemies.
[259:54.27]Our rift is fading.
[259:57.95]There's way too many.
[259:58.87]There's like a thousand people.
[260:00.49]What the fuck?
[260:03.18]Oh, my God.
[260:05.28]Explosive archers.
[260:07.58]Oh, my goodness.
[260:08.72]That was this.
[260:09.42]We just got overwhelmed.
[260:11.28]I lost.
[260:12.64]I lost.
[260:13.08]I lost in the game and IRL.
[260:18.92]We were doing good, too.
[260:20.17]Yeah.
[260:24.27]I think we can do it.
[260:30.23]I think this is our Placidusax.
[260:33.37]And we could do it.
[260:35.00]This is tough. This is fun.
[260:39.00]I understand what was going wrong.
[260:41.00]What happened?
[260:44.00]I had archers behind the barricade, so things were shooting at the archers at the barricade and blowing up the barricade.
[260:51.65]And if that barricade didn't keep going down, it would have been a lot easier.
[260:55.13]Interesting.
[260:56.01]I feel like I'm going to reduce the amount of... I'm going to reduce the amount of these.
[261:06.96]We... The middle room here, I think, gets overwhelmed to very... These rooms, we get to so... You know what I mean?
[261:13.32]We get overwhelmed.
[261:14.24]I think... Honest?
[261:16.87]You want some honesty?
[261:18.39]Sure.
[261:19.47]I think now that the bombers are just running into my fire traps, we could- we could wall off that whole middle part.
[261:27.00]You- you want to wall off the- because I got- I'm putting stuff up.
[261:29.00]Not- not immediately, but like as soon as like we get pushed back to the rift room and we have some extra money.
[261:33.00]It would be like three barricades for the middle and I can protect them with fire.
[261:39.00]And then they'll only do left and right we won't have to worry about them like just walking in that room.
[261:43.00]Okay.
[261:44.00]Honest to goodness.
[261:47.36]So do we just wall it off and then just fight?
[261:50.92]Should we just keep putting barricades up?
[261:53.90]Just put barricades up every time they get destroyed.
[261:55.36]Just put them up there in the middle.
[261:58.08]Yeah.
[261:59.94]I'll spend the money on it.
[262:01.56]I have them on the bar.
[262:02.32]Alright.
[262:03.76]So I can put it up there if I need to.
[262:06.84]So in that case, I'm going to put some snow shooters in.
[262:11.96]Is this too high, though?
[262:13.74]You think that's too high?
[262:18.43]Or do you think that's alright?
[262:20.41]They should be shooting down.
[262:21.30]OK, well, they're they're ready.
[262:28.60]Will they complete level?
[262:30.06]Yeah, this is it.
[262:32.90]We learned every big learning curve we learned.
[262:37.19]Like I'm I'm a high school dropout.
[262:39.25]OK, so it takes me a second.
[262:44.09]Stay in school.
[262:47.27]Okay, we're good?
[262:48.67]Yeah.
[262:48.99]Let's do it.
[262:57.00]They're destroying the barricade.
[262:58.28]I think I just goofed up the barricade.
[262:59.48]The door is down.
[263:00.06]The door is down.
[263:00.94]It's me, Grandpa.
[263:14.34]They need to sell the voice packs.
[263:16.68]I'd buy the grandpa MLG grandpa voice pack.
[263:22.30]A couple ended up going the other way.
[263:24.56]Double kill.
[263:25.25]Triple kill.
[263:26.97]Quadra kill.
[263:29.47]Penta kill.
[263:44.80]Is there like a mana potion you can buy too?
[263:47.73]I don't know.
[263:48.35]Maybe.
[263:49.21]I think I'm going to go in on that.
[263:50.49]Get feared.
[263:58.23]Enemies at the rift.
[263:59.81]Huh?
[264:02.92]Is that a fake enemies at the rift or are they actually?
[264:04.84]No, they came.
[264:05.50]There is a few in here.
[264:06.68]And yeah, you're slow.
[264:08.44]Your turrets are shooting right as they turn that corner.
[264:10.58]It looks really good actually.
[264:12.08]That's very good.
[264:13.92]There are enemies in our rift room.
[264:16.44]Okay.
[264:17.78]I'm going to do the same thing in the other room.
[264:21.18]I'm going to put two or three over here.
[264:23.55]More enemies on the way.
[264:25.05]They breached another door.
[264:38.51]Just like in training.
[264:57.82]Yeah, once I'm able to have enough money to seal that up, I think it's going to get significantly easier.
[265:09.45]They're coming in the Astoria.
[265:20.08]Oh, that was good.
[265:29.39]And I also think your turrets being up here instead of like downstairs.
[265:34.30]Yeah, I didn't want to say nothing last time.
[265:36.30]Well, I'm really happy about it.
[265:39.08]I did put a few down there because that's the only other way they're coming in.
[265:43.52]Just to slow them down.
[265:55.29]We still got 15.
[266:04.28]We got 15 lives.
[266:05.28]Did you get that trinket thing?
[266:08.24]What trinket thing?
[266:08.86]We have 15 lives now.
[266:10.14]Oh, yeah, I do.
[266:13.98]Oh, fuckers.
[266:14.36]What?
[266:14.50]What happened?
[266:21.02]well we're still ahead of where we would normally be I blocked off this uh that area so I shouldn't be coming from the middle anymore alright good good good
[266:52.66]How about over here?
[266:56.94]How's over here look?
[267:02.21]This hallway I haven't built anything in it yet.
[267:04.45]I've spent all my money on making so they can't come that one way.
[267:07.13]Oh, there are two turrets.
[267:18.44]They trying to go down the middle now, OK?
[267:32.83]uh yeah there's there's guy in here he needs to come back you piece of he got in yeah I used the cooldown so they wouldn't count but a little late
[268:04.70]Alright, watch this side.
[268:21.72]We need to start building stuff in the other hallway for those shotguns.
[268:28.53]I have a little bit of money.
[268:29.51]I have enough to do one of those big spike wall things.
[268:35.81]I wonder if I should put one over there.
[268:51.34]I can't believe it.
[268:52.16]We're doing it so far.
[268:58.51]We're really doing it, honey.
[269:04.93]Is the only side that has anything?
[269:08.63]I'm going to.
[269:10.03]I'm going to run to the other side and put some stuff down.
[269:13.07]Go.
[269:18.69]Like we need something to attack somebody here.
[269:27.34]Well, they're only coming this way.
[269:28.96]Sorry, I have I fucked up.
[269:41.16]Why would it be facing this way by default?
[269:47.88]I gotta be ready to go sell that right now!
[269:58.47]Thank God.
[270:04.55]Do it!
[270:05.67]More enemies!
[270:08.12]oh my goodness no better place than this okay like this this thing this damage in here now okay where are they where are they going
[270:44.22]Alright, I'm going on the other side.
[270:51.47]I like that.
[270:51.97]I like that.
[270:54.17]Is that thing even attacking?
[270:56.45]Yeah, they are.
[270:57.21]I was making sure these things were attacking.
[271:10.60]How's it going up there?
[271:12.48]Really good.
[271:16.02]There's a lot of guys on the mini map.
[271:18.72]I'm going to come here.
[271:24.02]I got one big guy on the other side.
[271:32.87]What are these Orcs Must Die symbols on the ground that you can pick up?
[271:36.41]I think it's money for like the upgrade.
[271:39.05]Oh yeah, I think that skulls.
[271:42.31]Whoa, big guy.
[271:45.19]Oh, okay.
[271:45.83]There are enemies in our room.
[272:15.39]Oh, I summoned the storm above me.
[272:19.99]I think.
[272:24.27]We're just pretty weird.
[272:27.12]Oh, they grouped up.
[272:28.18]That's good.
[272:44.10]Okay, what do we need?
[272:45.54]What are we missing?
[272:46.14]What's the problem here?
[272:48.94]Um... Damn, I need to sell that tar so I can build better barricades.
[272:54.31]What do you need me to sell?
[272:58.81]Uh, this tar over here so I can do a second barricade here.
[273:02.44]I think, um... This one right here?
[273:05.50]Okay, next time I'll do it.
[273:07.20]Alright, they're coming in the left side.
[273:23.97]Okay, bombers are coming.
[273:26.69]This is the only way they're coming up right now, right?
[273:34.93]Nice.
[273:48.98]and make sure they die whatever the yellows are on the map these uh these uh the crossbow guys apparently blow them up too flaming guys okay where are they getting kind of stuck up okay it's over there
[274:18.46]The fear is so good.
[274:21.60]I'm so glad I was bullied into using it.
[274:23.35]I'm just going to keep freezing him.
[274:35.43]I feel like I've been doing good with the staff.
[274:38.52]We got some bombers coming.
[274:39.58]They're down the bottom of the stairs.
[274:47.24]Why?
[274:47.62]Why does it default to... I tried to spin it.
[274:54.24]God.
[274:57.89]Why does it default to facing towards you?
[275:00.19]I wish I could answer that.
[275:08.02]Logically speaking!
[275:10.78]It feels like it's a good idea to die when they're at the rift and you can just spam magic.
[275:16.94]Because when you respawn there.
[275:18.72]Oh, they got one.
[275:21.22]Okay.
[275:22.38]Please.
[275:23.22]Who have I got?
[275:23.86]I'm going to put some more frost up here.
[275:32.65]Like down where they... You know what I'm saying?
[275:34.51]Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[275:41.12]I think I know what you're saying.
[275:58.07]OK, they are going around here.
[275:59.95]We got a lot of bombers coming.
[276:07.42]Hard to read map.
[276:12.28]barricades down over here we got a lot of people coming up in a minute sure do I got a lot of trolls on my side that are going to be hard to deal with
[276:43.82]What?
[276:45.50]What?
[276:45.72]It was shooting through him.
[276:55.97]Okay, we got an issue.
[277:13.23]There are enemies in our rift room!
[277:14.89]Yeah!
[277:15.56]No shit!
[277:16.92]Of course!
[277:18.00]Oh, there are enemies in the rift room!
[277:19.92]Can you see what happened here?
[277:22.96]There's just... There's just too many!
[277:25.10]So many!
[277:26.26]You can't... How do I kill that many trolls?
[277:30.50]What the fuck?
[277:31.14]And then there's still two more waves!
[277:35.85]Oh, they just, like, pile in.
[277:38.23]Just two dozen Omega enemies.
[277:43.15]shit we were doing we were doing alright damn it they're still beating me up I thought we had it too I thought we had a good thing going there is this possible I think part of it is that it expects you to have more of the upgrades from playing the game on the easier difficulty first I'm gonna cope with that and say yeah
[278:12.31]Yeah, that's that's pretty good coat.
[278:16.79]So we went to.
[278:21.53]I mean, I'm I'm I'm an addict.
[278:23.38]I would just keep playing on hard.
[278:27.24]Yeah, man.
[278:29.52]Yeah, man.
[278:32.44]I'm at that.
[278:33.16]OK, here's the strategy.
[278:35.27]Wave Wave 6 was hard, right?
[278:37.69]That's when all the trolls start coming and we had a hard time.
[278:41.25]What if?
[278:42.70]On wave six, after we destroy the bomb guys, we just build more barricades on one side so that they have to go the other way.
[278:50.90]And then we double team one side.
[278:52.62]Okay.
[278:57.07]Are you confident?
[279:01.57]I'm confident.
[279:02.35]That sounds like an actionable plan.
[279:04.55]I'm just going to follow you around and just kill things with you.
[279:09.41]When are you going to do a puppet show?
[279:11.66]Um, I don't know.
[279:15.72]Wait, Ster and I already did that.
[279:17.60]Do you remember the puppet show stream?
[279:20.04]No.
[279:20.12]I actually might need more damage.
[279:21.78]The freeze is great, but I don't think it hurts very much.
[279:36.52]Kelsey has it right.
[279:38.16]These new red rifts are bringing smaller orc factions together.
[279:41.83]I just think you don't need to build that many of them.
[279:45.23]They were doing some pretty good work at the end, but once they got through, they got through and that was it.
[279:55.68]Ceiling lasers.
[279:58.12]People saying ceiling lasers.
[280:00.24]My ceiling lasers.
[280:01.54]Yeah, ceiling lasers?
[280:02.88]Uh, I'm going back and... Let's do another full, like, refund everything and try again.
[280:09.16]A full... Okay.
[280:10.78]I mean, I'm ready.
[280:14.89]But, you know, I'm going to optimize.
[280:17.75]Uh, okay.
[280:18.17]So... Let's do this.
[280:22.23]It's on Rift Lord.
[280:23.87]Uh...
[280:25.80]Here we go, right?
[280:26.70]Oh, shit.
[280:27.24]Can I upgrade my barricades?
[280:30.28]Because I don't think I've done that.
[280:31.46]I've never even looked.
[280:32.56]Oh, wait, wait up.
[280:33.24]What did we rerun?
[280:33.98]What did we rerun?
[280:34.52]Um... Before this?
[280:35.70]Yeah, but... I quit out to here.
[280:37.30]Is it even before this?
[280:38.71]Click the book at the bottom right.
[280:40.77]Oh, it's the book.
[280:42.15]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[280:43.95]Alright.
[280:55.08]I got to get a new strategy.
[280:58.63]People are saying sailing lasers are amazing, so I'm going to get sailing laser.
[281:02.83]Barricades block two spaces, increase cost.
[281:06.35]That's kind of probably good.
[281:11.55]Increase health and... Yeah, what am I... What?
[281:15.23]Okay, game's over.
[281:16.64]Game's over, dude.
[281:17.76]Yeah.
[281:19.10]We win.
[281:20.40]Game's over.
[281:21.06]Yeah.
[281:22.06]Game's fucking... It's all over.
[281:30.16]Okay, the Jar of Ghosts is now a lot better.
[281:35.62]So I got ceiling lasers.
[281:43.47]So what about... What should I use for a weapon?
[281:48.15]I feel like that arcane staff is doing pretty good, but... I think it looked good.
[281:54.41]I think also just focus on as few things as you can fully upgrade it.
[281:59.87]Yeah.
[282:00.77]and then like with your extra buy trinkets okay because I should be able to upgrade it all now at least let's see where is it three secondary radius or mana cost probably that
[282:24.28]Alright, so I have ceiling lasers leveled up all the way.
[282:26.88]I have my arcane staff maxed out all the way.
[282:30.23]I've got the jar of ghosts all the way.
[282:31.91]I can do one more thing.
[282:36.31]Tar all the way?
[282:37.13]If I can.
[282:40.07]Yeah, you do tar and I'm going to do the fire floors.
[282:45.47]I cannot.
[282:46.13]I don't have enough points to do the fire damage increase.
[282:48.62]I just have enough to make it even slower.
[282:53.60]OK.
[282:55.13]And I'm not ready yet.
[282:58.61]Tell me if he wins, I'm going to go play BioShock.
[283:03.91]Which one?
[283:06.45]Did you get the laser ceilings?
[283:07.87]I did.
[283:12.83]I'm just going to put tar traps down and laser ceilings above in those little corner rooms.
[283:19.58]And hope it works.
[283:20.94]OK, I'm ready.
[283:22.32]Alright, let's go.
[283:25.64]are you ready yeah oh now I'm ready yeah I I didn't all of the barricade upgrades are reduced cost so depending how cheap they are yeah they're usually 800 they cost 600. that's a lot
[283:49.34]It's my loadout.
[283:50.08]I'm okay with it.
[283:50.60]How big is it?
[283:50.96]Oh, this thing is huge!
[283:51.76]The laser ceiling thing is across the entire ceiling.
[283:54.06]Well, let's ready up and check.
[284:18.34]So does it aim at them or do they just walk through it?
[284:25.90]You should put it by the stairs.
[284:29.87]Right here where I am.
[284:35.19]You can rotate it long ways.
[284:36.47]Should I do more than one?
[284:39.67]I think you should do one on both stairs, yeah.
[284:43.79]I want to tar it up over here.
[284:50.77]That looks okay.
[284:53.98]I don't have enough to do.
[284:54.92]Should I prioritize the tar or should I prioritize putting another one over there?
[285:00.02]Another one over there.
[285:00.94]Because they should also kill the bombers.
[285:03.84]Okay.
[285:04.14]And you're talking about like over here, right?
[285:05.59]And then I can save money on focusing on barricades.
[285:08.99]Like right here?
[285:11.53]You mean this spot right here, right?
[285:13.63]Yeah.
[285:16.95]OK, then I'm going to put all my money into barricade.
[285:20.57]I can put another one.
[285:21.65]Is there another spot that we need?
[285:22.73]It's going to be all my money, but.
[285:26.82]I don't think so, because upstairs doesn't.
[285:29.68]Then I'll start putting tar down.
[285:32.32]Perfect placement.
[285:35.12]Put one on the other side too.
[285:44.22]okay well I I guess I'm ready I'm a believer we just just remind me when it's like wave six okay and we need to wave six close another doorway enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates they've broken through a gate
[286:40.94]I'm the healer yeah I like to play support I don't spend any of my money I just heal what's with this get away from me we got runners going up
[286:56.26]Are there headshots?
[286:56.90]Probably not.
[286:58.16]There are.
[286:58.84]There are.
[286:59.52]It might depend on the weapon, but yeah, you deal a lot more damage with headshots.
[287:03.97]I think the staff was doing them.
[287:05.13]You have to like aim oddly up into the right.
[287:09.62]We should probably hit things.
[287:12.14]Yeah.
[287:12.74]We got a lot of money now, too.
[287:17.80]Okay, I'm going to put another ceiling shooter.
[287:21.36]It does concern me that you just now realize there's headshots, though.
[287:25.80]I had no idea.
[287:30.20]Oh, boy.
[287:30.78]Oh, boy.
[287:32.50]Yeah.
[287:33.34]Okay.
[287:33.94]You can hurt people with the headshot.
[287:36.73]Sir.
[287:39.66]Yes.
[287:40.60]Yes, you can.
[287:42.30]It hurts a lot.
[287:44.72]You basically can't hurt the elementals without headshotting them.
[287:50.78]Speaking of which, there's some getting into the rift room and they need help.
[287:53.13]Come on.
[288:06.54]I feel like I have actually been instinctively shooting at the head.
[288:09.62]So, I don't think it's a problem.
[288:13.87]I hope so.
[288:15.29]Charlie.
[288:15.81]I hope so.
[288:35.20]There are enemies in our rift room!
[288:42.64]Such a liar.
[288:46.57]Okay good.
[288:54.77]Middle!
[288:57.77]Enemies at the rift!
[289:05.37]I'm trying to save my money so I can block the middle room and defend it.
[289:09.59]We got guys in the room.
[289:11.97]There are enemies in our room.
[289:17.11]Okay.
[289:30.58]I'm blocking this.
[289:32.81]I can do it with two.
[289:36.01]No, don't.
[289:38.21]What?
[289:39.49]Nothing walks here when I block it.
[289:41.73]At the end.
[289:44.08]Okay.
[289:44.46]Well, it's not the end yet.
[289:46.24]Wave six.
[289:47.22]I'm preparing for wave six.
[289:49.94]I'm preparing for wave six.
[289:52.12]Okay.
[289:53.12]They keep coming up there in wave six.
[289:56.22]Okay.
[289:57.83]Make sure you headshot them.
[289:59.41]I will.
[290:13.00]They're almost there!
[290:15.86]You good?
[290:17.62]I might need a little help.
[290:27.99]There are enemies in our Rift Room!
[290:46.43]just seemed like a lot of money you know you got money no I'm saying it just seemed like a lot of money to build those there okay we got guys in here again yeah there's a lot of people on this side though
[291:18.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[291:33.97]We need to go find the shaman who's summoning these.
[291:39.47]No jokes.
[291:40.59]No jokes are allowed until we win.
[291:43.37]Okay.
[291:47.88]I thought I was being serious.
[292:15.98]Hey guys.
[292:17.06]Get in the game.
[292:32.41]Alright, what do we need?
[292:33.35]What do we need?
[292:34.27]What do we need?
[292:36.53]We need to defend this path more.
[292:39.35]And the other path has nothing in it.
[292:41.17]We need to kill the bombers before anything.
[292:42.53]Okay, okay, okay.
[292:47.26]those sappers will go straight for barricades I believe so and they have bombs on their backs they will absolutely smash any female that comes across their path
[293:20.62]Sure are.
[293:21.34]Okay.
[293:31.52]It's looking alright.
[293:34.96]He's focused on his new toy.
[293:36.18]He doesn't care about strategy.
[293:37.38]He just wants to see how many lasers he can buy.
[293:39.42]There's truth to that, but not as much as you think.
[293:43.88]There is truth to that.
[293:44.86]But look at this!
[293:49.03]Check this out.
[293:49.95]Watch that.
[293:50.39]Watch out.
[293:51.03]Watch that left side.
[293:52.82]I'm going.
[293:55.66]Got an ogre coming.
[294:00.18]I'm going to need help.
[294:01.58]Yep.
[294:05.06]You okay?
[294:06.40]No.
[294:07.70]Oh!
[294:09.99]They can't walk in.
[294:10.99]I used my thingy.
[294:14.11]But I think one did get in.
[294:21.60]The barricade is under attack the barricade is down Enemies
[294:54.34]I'm gonna put some more lasers up here.
[295:14.99]Okay.
[295:17.75]Ooh, ow.
[295:25.09]Alright, we're about to get... There's one enemy left.
[295:28.63]We got a second here.
[295:29.50]What do we need?
[295:32.74]I think we need... Why'd you kill it?
[295:36.66]I don't know.
[295:37.80]I don't know what we need.
[295:39.00]We just need more.
[295:40.62]I killed him because I'm in gamer mode.
[295:43.27]No!
[295:43.83]I freaking freaked out.
[295:45.79]I gotta fix that.
[295:46.65]I pressed it.
[295:48.11]You know what I mean.
[295:49.43]Sometimes it goes like...
[295:56.60]I need tar on this side, like right here.
[295:59.41]Yep.
[296:18.99]Is that jar that makes them run just like always active?
[296:22.55]I don't know.
[296:23.75]Does that gnoll hit you and just walked away?
[296:28.10]Alright, car down.
[296:46.86]Same side, right?
[296:48.78]Yeah.
[296:49.36]I need a bigger challenge.
[296:58.52]That staff is really good.
[297:00.90]No, it's great.
[297:02.40]That's awesome.
[297:12.45]There's no way.
[297:16.45]The barricade is down.
[297:18.67]Oh, oh.
[297:18.89]I don't want to hear that.
[297:23.87]I don't spend so much money fixing those.
[297:34.72]These archers, dude.
[297:36.57]Yeah, they're awful.
[297:49.19]Hey, Ster.
[297:49.87]We are about to be on wave six.
[297:52.01]Do not kill that guy.
[297:52.99]Let him roll.
[297:53.55]Oh, he's going to die from the lasers.
[297:55.11]So how are we?
[298:00.63]I'm going to block this whole path.
[298:03.99]Sell this tar immediately once this is over.
[298:06.87]Sell all this right here.
[298:07.91]Sell everything here besides the barricade.
[298:11.09]Okay.
[298:11.27]Even the stuff downstairs?
[298:13.07]No, no.
[298:13.47]Just like this thing on the wall.
[298:15.07]Okay, sell.
[298:15.77]I got it.
[298:16.29]I can sell your stuff.
[298:17.04]And then I'm going to barricade here.
[298:19.06]And then we're going to presume that they're going to go only the other way.
[298:21.66]Alright.
[298:22.16]So now I got money.
[298:24.36]Should I stack middle?
[298:27.34]Or this side needs some help over here.
[298:29.70]Yeah, they're only coming that side now.
[298:32.29]Okay.
[298:34.73]You're talking about where I am right now, right?
[298:44.79]Yeah.
[298:45.14]Oh, eat shit.
[298:45.88]We're ready this time.
[298:48.52]We're ready this time.
[298:49.74]Evil villains!
[298:52.82]You alright?
[298:57.44]Yeah.
[298:58.69]Okay, yeah, they're all only coming this way.
[299:04.61]I have this so many lasers over there too.
[299:07.27]It's ridiculous.
[299:12.97]If you if you turn the corner, you're going to laugh.
[299:14.54]It's a joke how much this how many ways there are.
[299:18.34]OK, I have to go look.
[299:20.96]Yeah.
[299:23.08]Alright, watch that other side.
[299:28.94]Uh, bombers are coming the other way.
[299:30.52]Yep.
[299:31.00]Can't let the bombers get through.
[299:32.30]Alright, we're good.
[299:50.32]We're going over this side.
[299:51.06]Okay.
[299:51.30]I wish we could ping the map.
[299:53.05]I like what we're looking at.
[299:54.83]Any game that doesn't have that now feels like it should have it.
[299:59.33]Alright.
[299:59.91]You head to that left side.
[300:02.57]No, they're not going up.
[300:03.87]Oh, they're not going up.
[300:04.70]That's right.
[300:05.22]Okay.
[300:20.55]Yep, they're not going up.
[300:21.49]Okay, good.
[300:22.87]We just need to, if there's ever any yellow on the mini map, it's a problem.
[300:25.87]Can't cast without mana!
[300:54.98]You don't have those healing snow cannons anymore, do you?
[300:58.56]I do not.
[301:00.48]Bombers are coming.
[301:01.61]I'm going to check the other wall.
[301:02.67]Yep.
[301:08.11]Hopefully they don't break it.
[301:15.26]I can't really look at them right now.
[301:18.44]I'm okay over here if you need to go over there.
[301:21.25]Okay, there's like two layers of walls, so I'm saving my money.
[301:24.79]Alright, this is clear.
[301:27.76]Okay, yeah, they walked around.
[301:28.76]Bombers are coming the other way, though.
[301:30.08]That shouldn't matter.
[301:31.14]Yep, got him.
[301:34.31]I got these two bombers coming in this way.
[301:36.61]I'll take care of it.
[301:45.07]Shit, I didn't heal you in time, sorry.
[301:46.65]No, I'm fine.
[301:47.27]I get to come back in the convenient place.
[301:56.00]Looking good.
[302:04.23]It's pretty messy over here, but it's okay.
[302:07.60]There's one guy left.
[302:09.36]I can clean this up if I do this though.
[302:11.44]I haven't spent my money yet.
[302:19.43]He's gonna die in a second.
[302:20.57]He's literally walking through the lasers right now.
[302:22.51]Okay.
[302:28.97]I pulled some of your tar up here.
[302:32.63]more enemies all the way the optimal spot alright whoa that's a lot of those things thankfully they all came this way okay where are you that was a lot of guys alright I think that place that's safe over there for a little while where are we prioritizing big guys on the left um they should only be coming
[303:02.95]uh on the bridge keeping an eye on the map in case something weird happens like yeah there's uh there's more guys there's more bombers yeah they're not the lasers will kill them instantly when they walk through here alright we've got every angle is is seeing problems
[303:35.03]I'm just keeping an eye on it.
[303:42.33]If anything slips through, I have the they can't go in the rip button.
[303:45.42]There's so many big enemies, it's ridiculous.
[304:03.88]it is uncomfortable that this is still like a how are we ever gonna deal with this before though I don't know one way oh that hurts what is hitting us something is shooting us or something it's like an archer the way that's shooting over bombers okay yeah they're hitting the lasers and dying
[304:31.34]Stacking the barricade where?
[304:34.16]We're good.
[304:34.68]We're good.
[304:36.06]It's right where you were.
[304:37.37]The barricade that's right here.
[304:44.87]God damn it.
[304:46.93]When you put something on the ground and click this, sometimes it not happen.
[304:50.76]No.
[304:51.76]Me problem.
[304:56.52]They're almost there.
[305:09.92]I think uh using these wall grinders have helped a lot too yeah because they deal a lot of damage looking good
[305:29.50]Should be one more wave.
[305:30.78]As soon as this wave ends, be aware of any bombers.
[305:33.67]Yep.
[305:34.19]And then if we can handle that, we're probably okay.
[305:40.14]I'm just going to fill the rest of this room with lasers.
[305:42.62]Like it's going to be the whole hallway.
[305:56.11]I think you should put them in this room where all the grinders are.
[305:58.11]Okay.
[305:58.55]But as they're walking around the barricades, I don't think they go down that far.
[306:02.03]They don't fit on the ceiling.
[306:03.72]Oh, yeah.
[306:04.20]They can't go up there.
[306:07.74]Alright.
[306:08.38]Only a few left.
[306:11.14]Then you should put tar all along that path.
[306:13.52]Yeah.
[306:13.62]I'm going to just go.
[306:17.51]I mean, where the barricades are.
[306:20.77]Where you are right now.
[306:22.09]Yeah.
[306:23.31]So just like tar, tar, tar, tar, tar all over here.
[306:25.51]Yep.
[306:25.89]You got it.
[306:32.35]Alright.
[306:35.47]Here they come.
[306:36.59]Which way are they going?
[306:44.30]They got me.
[306:44.98]I think they're all going to run down this hall, so I think we're alright.
[306:50.98]Yep.
[306:59.60]Alright, how we doing?
[307:01.50]Good.
[307:03.64]They're going to have to come down this hall, right?
[307:08.78]There's no other place they can go.
[307:09.72]Yep.
[307:16.25]Okay, I got this.
[307:19.99]Yep, here they are.
[307:20.83]Okay, they insta-died.
[307:33.36]There's so many enemies hard is ridiculous.
[307:36.42]This is brutal This is fucking brutal His orcs gotta die
[308:06.49]What are the green dots on the map?
[308:08.62]Yeah, I think those are the things that are killing us.
[308:10.60]That are shooting us from far away.
[308:22.65]Yeah, I put these push walls in here.
[308:24.01]It feels like they're just stuck now.
[308:25.23]Ooh, that hurt.
[308:39.12]doubters are shitting and screaming the only way to shit oh the green things I think are mana potions ah okay
[309:17.80]Somebody said I'm ruined Money money always believe in the banana bros.
[309:37.88]That's right We're gonna do it eventually
[309:49.18]I mean we're lapping toad right now like they can't even come in this room second lap yeah we've second lap toad I know and unfortunately chat just told all the doubters that was amazing
[310:18.92]It is kind of hard to hit in the head.
[310:20.36]Here it is.
[310:20.80]I'll take a three.
[310:29.43]Three stars.
[310:30.29]Yeah, let's go.
[310:31.51]Hey, most McDonald's are three.
[310:34.37]I'm okay with that.
[310:36.47]Most McDonald's are three stars?
[310:38.24]Most McDonald's sit between like 2.5 and like three.
[310:41.48]I think that's good.
[310:42.08]I think we're fine.
[310:47.18]I think I got like 14 upgrade skulls from that though.
[310:54.30]Additional lasers.
[310:56.06]I kind of like that.
[311:00.83]Just grab a quick question for you.
[311:02.65]Yeah, just to make sure that we understand the, you know, the remainder of the stream time.
[311:08.81]Are you are we playing this for a while or are you playing Five Nights at Freddy's?
[311:12.55]Are you just what's the deal here?
[311:14.52]uh what do you want I mean I'm up here I'm enjoying this I'm I'm I'm an enjoyer okay I think like we just let me just like got it you know what I mean like like we just got it well the chat seems to disagree chat's like 519 freddy let's go okay I mean we did just play this one level for like four hours that's true
[311:42.19]Well, I mean, we've been gaming.
[311:44.95]Are you like in funny Five Nights at Freddy's mode or do you just want to chill and play?
[311:51.13]Don't pressure Ster in doing this.
[311:53.93]It's whatever Ster wants to do.
[311:56.78]Is Five Nights at Freddy's funny?
[311:58.94]I mean, yeah.
[312:04.44]I want to do the next stage and then we'll see.
[312:07.64]Okay.
[312:08.70]Because I feel like we just comprehended the game.
[312:13.28]I feel like we could beat the next stage first try.
[312:16.46]Okay.
[312:19.32]Let's, uh, let's do it.
[312:29.31]But yeah, I knew I like Orcs Must Die a lot, but as the difficulty ramps...
[312:35.55]I'm remembering why I like it a lot.
[312:37.19]Oh, this is fun.
[312:37.93]This is great.
[312:38.73]This one seems equally as complicated.
[312:40.13]Mhm.
[313:00.96]there's two doors oh I got um I got I got a laser section right here okay we got teleporters as well okay maybe we don't beat it first try just because it's confusing the optimal spot oh they're not long enough
[313:32.16]Okay.
[313:32.76]Spread them out.
[313:39.60]Could I effectively put them at an angle?
[313:43.05]I guess I could go like this and then like that.
[313:45.55]Yeah, I could stagger it out.
[313:47.47]I think ultimately they all are going to have to come down this main bridge.
[313:52.15]Yeah.
[313:53.23]Even if they come from other ways, let's start at the bridge.
[313:56.47]So you think I should put some of my stuff right here?
[314:01.47]Right, like in front of... Is this the only way they can come up?
[314:05.01]Is there no other way they can get up here?
[314:07.53]It appears there's two ways up.
[314:10.44]But they're always going to have to cross that bridge.
[314:13.28]Those stairs go up to like a high ground for us.
[314:15.54]Ah, okay.
[314:18.38]I'm going to laser it up right here.
[314:27.62]Okay, I just clicked like four times and it didn't place.
[314:30.32]That was weird.
[314:30.98]I don't know why it's doing that.
[314:39.06]It seems like a waste.
[314:47.77]Okay, I'm just going to collaborate with the laser village.
[314:52.57]What's this new thing?
[314:54.39]Charge wall?
[314:55.69]The new thing we just unlocked.
[314:58.19]Oh, I don't know.
[314:59.93]It said it dealt lightning damage.
[315:02.95]That's all I know about that.
[315:04.08]I'm going to put the next one back here in a moment.
[315:13.84]What's your strategy?
[315:15.54]I have a strategy.
[315:16.44]Where does this go?
[315:17.20]I am walling this off right here in the front, and then they're going to have to walk around this narrow side.
[315:24.76]I'm going to push wall on that because it goes into the death pit.
[315:31.76]Let's do this.
[315:35.44]My barricades are also metal now.
[315:37.44]Look at that.
[315:39.54]Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.
[315:42.88]Yeah, they were last time.
[315:45.68]Dum dum.
[316:13.41]Here he goes.
[316:17.33]That is a great strategy that works great.
[316:20.85]Yeah, they go into the meat grinder.
[316:22.07]It also appears like I'm just they're trying to attack me and then I keep hopping back on the thing.
[316:45.57]Oh, they broke it.
[316:51.17]Oh, I think I know what happened.
[316:52.57]This didn't work out as well as we wanted to.
[317:02.24]I think I messed it up on purpose or not on purpose.
[317:07.54]I think I messed it up.
[317:09.26]Easy money.
[317:10.10]They're not counting.
[317:11.24]They didn't count.
[317:13.37]I used my scroll.
[317:16.94]Oh, that's right.
[317:17.78]They are not counting.
[317:21.71]Damn it.
[317:27.38]Okay, that one counted, though.
[317:29.60]We tried to fear it, but it was too late.
[317:32.00]Okay, I would be down for a quick reset.
[317:34.46]A quick reset?
[317:35.91]Yeah, because I think I made them blow up all my shit.
[317:41.99]But we don't have to.
[317:43.03]Okay, we did.
[317:43.73]Last one, then it's like Five Nights at Freddy's, maybe, kind of, maybe.
[317:54.62]Five Nights at Freddy's what about my money just refund just refund the money everyone's worried about their money capitalism grinders lasers and then walk the middle I remember oh I think I know what's happening kind of happened when I was around just good timing and luck right no it's not here do the lasers here to use magic
[318:18.84]I think if we're standing on the other side of the barricade things are going to try and shoot at us and it might be why the barricade blew up okay lasers here and then we'll like defend this narrow and then I'm I'm doing um slow here I'll just do a line of slow I will I'll prioritize slow this whole line okay
[318:47.35]Let's go for it.
[318:55.13]I can't wait to stop these orcs.
[318:57.58]I just clicked three times and it didn't... It actually wasn't registering.
[319:00.72]Is something wrong with my mouse?
[319:01.90]Weird.
[319:02.44]I'm missing input.
[319:18.68]Not so tough now.
[319:27.19]Yeah.
[319:34.00]They all want to help.
[319:36.08]They do.
[319:37.30]They're like, hey, they're weak to lightning.
[319:39.54]And then you lightning them for one damage.
[319:43.36]Yeah, that kind of really isn't hurt.
[319:44.68]Maybe these are a little weaker.
[320:00.00]Oh man, the Sonya just floating in here.
[320:06.31]Do a zigzag with the barricades?
[320:22.56]It works?
[320:24.24]Okay, give me money.
[320:26.40]Give me money.
[320:26.86]Look at this.
[320:28.36]There are way too many people in here now.
[320:33.04]Let them in, let them in, let them in.
[320:34.70]They're in?
[320:35.88]Let them in the bridge.
[320:38.90]Never, never.
[320:39.62]I activated the thing so we could just let them disappear.
[320:43.22]Might be too late.
[320:45.61]I don't know how long it lasts.
[320:47.77]Nobody got in.
[320:52.75]Nobody got in.
[320:56.65]You wanna keep smudging it up?
[320:57.39]Something destroyed the barricade again.
[320:58.73]You wanna keep smudging it up?
[321:01.22]Or do you want lasers?
[321:01.76]The army is attacking on another front!
[321:04.46]They've breached another door!
[321:07.58]Don't build anything.
[321:08.70]I think they're coming from the other way, so none of that's gonna even matter.
[321:12.30]Oh, shit.
[321:12.50]Let's go!
[321:24.65]Cannot put lasers here, unfortunately, so I can't really do very much in this.
[321:28.64]You can put them the under path.
[321:29.94]Oh, yeah.
[321:33.22]Go ahead.
[321:38.01]Who got by?
[321:39.55]Oh, a bunch of the little runners got by.
[321:41.99]Not happening.
[321:49.13]Oh, this is fucked up.
[321:53.96]I'm dead.
[322:00.20]It feels like you need a lot of lightning damage.
[322:02.48]That's probably why they gave you the lightning trap right before this.
[322:07.79]What is it?
[322:08.13]Around my sword, but it doesn't feel like it does enough.
[322:12.43]I wonder if the blue highlight mean like a shield or a barrier or something?
[322:18.20]On what?
[322:18.96]Some of the enemies are highlighted blue, some of them highlighted green.
[322:21.50]I wonder what that means.
[322:22.79]Haven't seen it.
[322:31.19]Got bombers coming, make sure you kill them.
[322:34.05]Yeah, they'll die from this.
[322:34.91]Okay.
[322:50.43]I just jumped into that.
[322:55.99]There's a bunch of orcs.
[323:00.33]There's a bunch of orcs.
[323:05.39]Oh, I thought we were going to fight dragons.
[323:09.31]There's a bunch of fucking orcs.
[323:11.69]That looks like a lot.
[323:21.90]okay this is really hard damn this game is hard I I didn't think it would be that big of a difficulty from like normal to hard when normal was like we could win every round no effort
[323:45.51]I mean, that's that's a good thing, though.
[323:47.01]That means it's you know, it's you don't just blow through the whole thing.
[323:51.97]Yeah.
[323:53.41]I think you are right, though.
[323:54.89]I think you play through a bunch of normal upgrade and a bunch of stuff and then we need it.
[324:01.34]We need like your options of it like we don't have.
[324:04.04]We would have to respect every single time like by the wall charger upgrade the wall charger.
[324:08.22]Yeah, the lightning thing like six times or whatever.
[324:12.97]Well, sorry, Believers, but I do have to give you a little bit of a... We didn't know the level, and we didn't know what we were dealing with.
[324:24.66]I know that you should always believe, but we didn't know what we were doing.
[324:28.78]What gave me the middle finger?
[324:33.70]What is this special upgrade as well that items have?
[324:38.21]I was able to do it on the Jar of Ghosts, and I don't know why.
[324:42.83]It was just there.
[324:43.69]I could press it.
[324:47.70]I'm not sure why I could.
[324:51.46]Yeah, I imagine that I don't even know any of them are.
[324:56.26]Just special upgrade.
[324:58.39]For the special enemies.
[325:02.93]It literally tells you why.
[325:06.23]it does no it doesn't they're lying I'm talking about a different thing is it do you have to complete this thing first like fear 100 enemies for instance like the thing in the middle that's for the unique upgrades oh yeah that's right then the special upgrade is just an x it doesn't have like an explanation yeah I don't know what I did but I unlocked it for the jar of ghosts I don't know why I think you just unlock it maybe
[325:34.80]Alright.
[325:35.22]So how are you doing?
[325:37.42]You feel alright?
[325:38.82]You feel like you want to watch along a different night?
[325:44.42]We can do that if you think you have the energy to play it.
[325:47.79]How long is Five Nights at Freddy's?
[325:50.73]Because I'm picturing it as like a 20 minute thing.
[325:54.84]I mean, it's as long or as short as you really want to make it.
[325:58.32]It's probably like, do you want to beat it?
[326:01.10]Do you want to be Ster the Gamer and beat Five Nights at Freddy's?
[326:04.06]Because it'll probably take like an hour or two.
[326:07.32]But if Ster the Gamer does not want to game, it could take like two to three hours.
[326:14.93]Let's do it another night.
[326:17.11]Let's do it like at the start of the stream, another night.
[326:19.43]And this way I also like am forcing you to play something with me again.
[326:27.83]He hates us.
[326:28.55]Otherwise, if we do it right now, it is going to be like a 10 minute, like, haha, oh, the ghost.
[326:34.63]Yeah.
[326:35.57]We want Ster to be really locked in, focused, not after five and a half hours of heavy gaming.
[326:42.45]And then this way you also get an additional Jerma stream.
[326:46.81]Otherwise, he would not show up.
[326:48.91]He's going to be making his claymations.
[326:51.26]I'll be making my clay and molding all that.
[326:53.74]Yeah.
[326:57.44]Alright.
[326:57.90]So what do you um, I'm I'm taking I'm taking some time off.
[327:02.18]I'll be gone for like, four or five days.
[327:07.41]You want to you want to square up and kind of do this on?
[327:13.77]Are you when you when you're ready, I don't really have anything on my schedule except for Fridays and Sundays, I do some stuff.
[327:21.24]Otherwise, I'm totally free.
[327:24.23]Okay, yeah, I'll ping you on Discord with a gameplay.
[327:29.58]Okay, but can we play again on the other difficulty?
[327:33.72]You want to play on the normal difficulty right now?
[327:36.40]Yeah, yeah.
[327:38.26]Yeah, I'll do one more.
[327:39.80]I want to earn some skulls.
[327:42.52]I don't know.
[327:43.66]I'm really enjoying this.
[327:45.52]Yeah, we'll play.
[327:46.48]We can do... Yeah, that sounds good.
[327:48.32]Esther was never going to play FNAF.
[327:51.79]I was... Dude, it's...
[327:54.28]you know what I mean you know what I'm saying no I know what you're saying I mean the energy level no I really do the energy level of the stream right I want it to be yeah it's like it's it's a game where you need a lot of like there's not much going on I want us to be like in our prime 20 year old I want to get in a time machine go back to 2008 when this shit came out
[328:20.61]Jerma's building up now that it's going to be like the greatest content I've ever produced.
[328:27.77]No, you're good.
[328:29.62]It's kind of a big deal.
[328:30.64]It's kind of like, you know, it's kind of building up.
[328:34.30]When you're at peak energy levels, then it'll be more fun.
[328:38.38]That's what matters.
[328:40.30]Okay, so we're on the same level.
[328:43.54]This is on the regular difficulty.
[328:45.96]Do we want to rethink a strategy here or just kind of go?
[328:49.60]I think on regular difficulty, we can just go.
[328:53.11]We're doing what we're doing, I think would be okay.
[328:56.30]alright I'll do I'm gonna take the there's also you gotta do like these special challenges and stuff uh that thing you said like about how I I wanna I wanna try the wind belt and push them off you don't remember your childhood during your mother's favorite teleporting the family cat down from a tree are you sure you sound upset now remember and yes no no no no no no no no you sound you sound like I just I just ruined your night
[329:23.50]to work to use magic hey thanks for ruining my night we were all waiting for now you have work to do I completely understand and plus we're having fun playing this so what's the difference usually see that's the thing usually when I suggest a game to you um you hate it and we only play for like 20 minutes but I I feel like you're enjoying this a lot yeah I mean not everything
[329:53.04]I don't think there's been a game that I genuinely didn't like.
[329:57.56]I could pick one.
[329:58.08]You could do one.
[330:00.68]Oh, I thought you meant like, oh, yeah, I know one you didn't.
[330:03.02]Oh.
[330:03.86]Oh.
[330:04.02]I don't know.
[330:07.68]You're a good sport.
[330:08.74]You just brought me under the bus.
[330:09.56]What is it?
[330:09.84]You're a good sport.
[330:10.60]Alright.
[330:12.79]So I'm just going to put lasers in random places here.
[330:15.47]Okay.
[330:15.79]I did the same thing.
[330:18.03]I'm ready.
[330:19.99]We're doing the same strategy.
[330:20.89]I'm going to go like this.
[330:22.58]Okay.
[330:24.24]But now the enemies will, like, die.
[330:26.94]Keep in mind, if you're betting, this is on normal.
[330:29.06]So, I mean, we could screw this whole thing up.
[330:31.22]That's true.
[330:32.30]There are eight waves.
[330:33.28]There's still armored men.
[330:55.83]Dude, enemies are dying when I shoot them.
[330:57.78]Yeah, you probably shouldn't have bet against us if you did.
[331:02.86]I mean, that's probably not a great idea.
[331:07.82]But see, what a lot of people probably did is they knew that everyone was going to be betting, like, of course they're on normal, they're going to win.
[331:12.87]And they put, like, every dollar they have in their pocket on, you know, on red at the relay table.
[331:18.57]They're just like, oh, I could have.
[331:20.67]Not on red, sorry, on zero.
[331:21.95]On zero.
[331:23.71]That it's like whenever there's like, oh, 80%, yes, this is going to happen.
[331:28.73]90% like, oh, I want to bet on the opposite for the odds.
[331:30.75]We realize the odds are that way because you're going to lose, like, you're going to lose your money.
[331:35.35]Even if you only put a little bit because the odds, you're still losing your money.
[331:41.02]Well, this is not going that smoothly so far, so I'd say that it is.
[331:49.12]I'd say that there is no way we're going to lose.
[331:52.64]Okay.
[331:56.19]I just clicked three times to get that out there.
[331:58.47]I'm going to complain about this the whole night.
[332:01.59]Oh, yeah.
[332:01.96]We get to pause.
[332:02.84]We take our sweet time now.
[332:04.72]They're coming from the other way if you want to set up the lasers.
[332:08.14]Time to throw?
[332:09.02]No.
[332:11.24]I'm prioritizing the tar.
[332:13.03]I feel like that's the best thing to do.
[332:22.50]right in the middle to the easy better oh shit I'm so sorry and then you can set up lasers like after that when they're on their ground and stuff you want to put a laser just like right above that just like wham and wham yeah you got it because they're gonna get all jammed up on that you got it
[332:51.47]more enemies on the way enemies are attacking on another front they've reached another door the barricade is under attack I'm gonna go put archers like in the final room oh they they really they already destroyed it
[333:20.48]see they they knew it was a they knew it was a threat they are wait people are getting by some who got by yeah the little tiny rats I'm gonna I'm gonna go put archers back there so that they catch the stragglers
[333:53.15]Are they coming from both sides now?
[333:55.57]Yes.
[334:13.68]Fear is really great with the lasers because it makes them just walk through them like four times.
[334:21.38]pretty funny if we lost.
[334:23.24]You want to lose as a joke, Sharla?
[334:26.60]That would be unfortunate to all the people that believe in us.
[334:34.88]Yeah, but like how many people really is that?
[334:37.86]Two, three million, I think. ...
[334:58.43]Put it down.
[334:58.97]Come on.
[334:59.35]What the hell?
[335:05.71]Good freeze.
[335:06.69]Good freeze.
[335:08.08]Right in the zapper.
[335:12.60]What is that purple that keeps going on that you're doing?
[335:14.78]Is that the fear or something else?
[335:17.42]The purple I'm putting down is an AOE and then the green is the fear.
[335:25.44]Alright, I think I'm going to goop.
[335:26.84]I'm going to do some goop.
[335:31.44]Start a goop spot right here.
[335:36.87]Probably right so they can slowly go into your things.
[335:42.41]I think.
[335:52.61]Goop.
[335:55.92]I will stay down here.
[335:56.56]Alright.
[335:58.25]I'm going to do the other one because I have the wind thing to push them off on the high ground.
[336:10.48]Is he sleepy?
[336:12.56]No, we're just... He is.
[336:15.00]Why did I point behind me like you were here?
[336:20.61]And I'm behind you.
[336:21.87]Yeah, he is.
[336:22.80]Yeah, that guy over there.
[336:24.44]Oh, they're all coming from up here.
[336:26.70]We got nobody.
[336:48.73]in the head come on here they go I'm like perma stunned oh you're dead yeah which might have been for the best to hold them there longer
[337:19.68]I missed that guy so many times it was embarrassing.
[337:40.64]Good.
[337:42.00]I'm going to continue the goop.
[337:46.02]That's one of my favorite things about you.
[337:52.74]I want yeah, I'm gonna go down Put it down excuse me game.
[338:01.08]I clicked a hundred times Sorry, it's like kind of late to be the one I'm screaming
[338:23.65]You're only supposed to click once?
[338:25.11]I know, but when I click once and it doesn't go, twice and it doesn't go, and then... And then it finally goes.
[338:29.03]I wonder why is that happening?
[338:32.10]That wasn't happening earlier.
[338:32.88]The computer's overheating.
[338:35.22]Uh-oh.
[338:47.96]Good.
[338:48.50]Look at that freeze.
[339:12.50]Big.
[339:13.72]Big.
[339:14.72]Huge.
[339:15.80]Hey, that skull.
[339:20.62]You wanted to collect skulls.
[339:21.40]Look.
[339:21.84]I'm getting it.
[339:22.34]Hey, I want it.
[339:24.72]Share it.
[339:26.06]no talk to me when you've earned one one day I will one day I might even surpass you perfect placement totally right okay you can't keep up
[339:56.33]Can't keep up.
[339:58.28]I'm too fast.
[339:59.60]Looks pretty even, so I guess just stay there.
[340:02.42]Wave six out of eight.
[340:04.25]That went quick.
[340:04.89]I need a bigger challenge.
[340:08.11]I'll need more mana soon.
[340:17.83]Oh shit, you alright?
[340:19.25]Yeah.
[340:19.69]No, I'm good.
[340:22.26]Try to... Try the game.
[340:51.57]We got some problems.
[340:54.34]There's too many orcs.
[340:55.70]Too many orcs?
[340:57.40]Oh, there really are too many orcs.
[341:02.55]There are enemies in our rift room.
[341:12.49]Uh, I'm gonna do we lose money if we let them get in and I do the protection thing?
[341:18.66]I don't think so.
[341:19.74]I think you just get money for killing stuff.
[341:24.14]Yeah, so that we technically lose.
[341:25.74]OK, now that you got it.
[341:27.72]I know you want those skulls, but.
[341:32.76]Be harder.
[341:33.55]Alright, we don't have any time really here.
[341:38.97]I'm going to start gooping here.
[341:41.88]I hope that works.
[341:44.18]This will surprise them.
[342:03.91]I like freezing them in the zap zone.
[342:06.31]It's very good.
[342:11.51]Stop goofing.
[342:13.85]Here comes the collapse?
[342:15.17]Why?
[342:16.01]Can we get a little bit more goop?
[342:18.01]I'm out of... Can we get some more goop?
[342:20.55]I'm out of money.
[342:22.41]Here comes the collapse.
[342:24.87]Don't let them win.
[342:26.04]Don't prove that person wrong.
[342:58.97]There totally was a mana potion, right?
[343:00.95]I want to get that and upgrade that and just be the guy who uses mana a lot.
[343:05.92]I feel like that's very useful.
[343:09.82]Like the wind thing, you can just keep spamming it.
[343:12.42]So once they get over here, I just keep clicking it, but it takes mana.
[343:22.87]This is it.
[343:24.93]This one's for all the marbles.
[343:29.79]I believe you.
[343:46.36]You're welcome.
[343:47.90]What?
[343:50.11]Oh, thank you.
[343:51.53]You know, guys, he has not even noticed that I've been healing his ass.
[343:56.35]I think maybe it's assumed that you heal over time or something.
[344:01.31]No, it's been me.
[344:02.09]It's been me the whole time.
[344:03.98]Oh.
[344:20.56]with me barry got some uh work in the end the this is clear for now I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming dude
[344:46.81]Matt, I'm about to become Twitch's number one Orcs Must Die streamer.
[344:53.05]You already are.
[344:57.85]That right there should be extra credit.
[345:06.70]That's a new high score.
[345:08.38]Two star.
[345:10.44]Oh, that's not very good.
[345:11.82]Hey, at least we beat it.
[345:18.86]uh so I guess streams up to you if there's if uh you know you're gonna cancel Five Nights at Freddy's then uh I'll keep playing till I cancel it I we we had a joint decision it's weird that you canceled it but are you still streaming uh yeah
[345:49.72]but I want to upgrade something.
[345:52.97]I agree with that.
[345:57.45]I think it's just that some items don't have a special upgrade is what's going on.
[346:05.20]I want to try something different.
[346:07.40]I'm doing a refund here.
[346:09.78]Wait, how come I have 98 skulls?
[346:12.31]I had 100.
[346:12.55]What?
[346:13.13]What's going on?
[346:14.37]What?
[346:15.11]You have what?
[346:16.73]98 skulls.
[346:17.49]Oh, do you refund it?
[346:18.91]Yeah.
[346:19.77]Yeah.
[346:19.99]The things that you buy do not get refunded.
[346:23.57]What do you mean?
[346:25.52]It's like if you buy.
[346:27.82]Yeah, it's refunding the upgrades, not the purchases of specific things.
[346:31.62]Yep.
[346:33.99]Everyone wants to see the hammer.
[346:35.01]I'm going to do it.
[346:35.71]Try the hammer.
[346:43.22]Oh, there is a mana potion, but we can't.
[346:46.44]I can't use it.
[346:48.20]Complete mage power to unlock.
[346:50.10]I want it man.
[346:50.72]I'm going to do the poison grenades or poison explosion potions.
[347:03.81]Saw blade launcher.
[347:11.97]What about window of I'm doing window of butterflies?
[347:14.57]It distracts enemies apparently.
[347:25.70]I actually think I can still do sailing lasers.
[347:30.12]Oh yeah.
[347:31.94]Yep, I can still do sailing laser.
[347:34.23]I don't know why so many of these are a war scenario only.
[347:39.19]All the cool looking ones is like, oh, that sounds, oh, I'm not going to buy something that is only for some missions.
[347:46.00]I think they're just, I mean, it's one of them's a gigantic catapult that I feel like it's kind of overpowered anywhere else.
[347:57.11]Are you good?
[348:02.01]He asks, am I good?
[348:03.89]I mean, do you want me to... Yeah, do you want me to press continue?
[348:12.68]Yeah.
[348:15.42]Got a new loadout.
[348:16.12]I want to check it out.
[348:23.38]We'll watch you no matter what because if you're not having fun, we aren't having fun.
[348:27.51]Stream FNAF.
[348:32.56]Ooh, look at this place.
[348:33.96]Wow, we're at the world's edge.
[348:37.18]Oh shit, it's one of these levels.
[348:38.74]Why are we here?
[348:41.70]We're apprentices.
[348:42.96]We just deal with the smaller orc attacks.
[348:44.56]It's in the middle.
[348:45.24]It's in the middle.
[348:46.90]Yeah, this is normal.
[348:47.74]We're playing on normal again, not on hard.
[348:49.93]Where the heck's the rift?
[348:50.73]Lois, maybe?
[349:06.81]Hammer poison.
[349:10.79]I don't have this anymore.
[349:11.75]Okay, you go in the middle and it's a giant castle with 100 stairs.
[349:18.59]And I think it's all the way at the top.
[349:25.82]Lasers was a great choice here.
[349:28.72]Yeah, it's all the way at the top.
[349:30.88]You can take the lasers off, babe.
[349:36.91]And then there's a teleporter all the way up to the top.
[349:39.54]I guess there's a spot for it in here.
[349:42.94]Yeah, Jesus, this is elaborate.
[349:47.60]You know, there's other entrances to that by like I feel like you should just build in the middle.
[349:54.16]And not let him come out now.
[349:57.69]Although if they can come from two different looks like a multiple different directions, this might get overwhelming really quickly.
[350:03.77]Yeah, maybe.
[350:05.63]So where is they come up through these areas here?
[350:09.75]No, where they actually come up to the rift.
[350:16.37]Oh wait, no, there are only two risks.
[350:18.28]I was I'm wrong.
[350:19.10]I was looking at the green doors.
[350:21.78]There's only the two rift, so it's just two sides.
[350:23.60]You take one side.
[350:24.42]I take one side probably.
[350:25.86]Alright, so I guess I'll just be at the top.
[350:36.65]We're gonna have to play some of this stuff, though.
[350:38.23]What is this new thing?
[350:40.13]This big, like... Range.
[350:43.59]This gas range.
[350:46.77]The grill?
[350:47.33]Yeah.
[350:48.19]They just walk over the grill?
[350:50.65]I guess.
[350:55.34]Well, let me read it.
[350:57.18]Snowblower.
[350:57.80]Triggers snow blast that damages and freezes enemies.
[351:02.50]Hmm.
[351:03.44]I kind of like that.
[351:06.91]Putting that out with that.
[351:09.12]Yeah, you take care of your side.
[351:10.60]I'll take care of mine.
[351:11.96]We're taking care of my side.
[351:19.18]OK, this thing is great.
[351:27.34]Can't wait to see this in action.
[351:35.16]There's the spot.
[351:40.48]Okay, I'm ready.
[351:42.64]Ready to go.
[351:48.54]If you fail your side, I'm going to be mad.
[351:58.11]This could work very well, or this might be very bad.
[352:01.27]I don't know.
[352:02.55]I got to put the butterflies down.
[352:04.55]I will.
[352:07.79]I have a strategy, those of you that are question marking.
[352:11.39]I do have a strategy.
[352:15.75]I'm worried.
[352:16.81]Oh, it's only one side right now.
[352:18.91]Totally immune to fire damage.
[352:20.07]Too much stuff that I picked up takes mana.
[352:23.75]That was a mistake.
[352:44.97]Now they're on the other side.
[352:52.30]Ah!
[352:55.39]Man, that's not cool.
[352:57.53]My computer crashed.
[353:03.91]Mine too.
[353:05.04]Fuck.
[353:08.52]No, I'm still in the game.
[353:11.78]What happened?
[353:12.86]No, I got fucking annihilated.
[353:23.38]I mean, my side's going awful.
[353:25.52]Mine's going probably worse, I would imagine.
[353:28.14]I wasn't even here to defend it at the beginning.
[353:36.89]Quick, get distracted by this.
[353:44.68]Oh, and my computer crashed again.
[353:49.63]That's unfortunate.
[353:50.75]Oh, shit.
[354:16.35]Uh, we're gonna.
[354:22.17]We're about to lose.
[354:28.70]Alright, are we?
[354:29.90]Uh, I used my scroll.
[354:32.86]Oh you did roll and I saved the day.
[354:39.37]Okay, I need to go back.
[354:42.05]What?
[354:43.39]Where am I?
[354:44.81]Where's all my stuff?
[354:45.69]Alright.
[354:46.36]This level is weird.
[354:47.74]I kind of just want to build up here.
[354:49.08]Okay, so when we beat this wave, I'm going to get all my money back because this does not work out.
[354:55.76]I agree.
[354:56.16]Alright, so let's do a new strategy here.
[355:05.35]This hammer is kind of a...
[355:09.13]I'm not a huge fan.
[355:10.29]Let's put it that way.
[355:14.13]Takes mana.
[355:19.25]How is that butterfly thing working out?
[355:22.04]I haven't really had a chance to try it.
[355:25.96]So you think we should just build in the middle?
[355:29.80]Honestly, yeah.
[355:31.88]Well, let's go for it.
[355:34.88]We still made it to the next wave.
[355:41.52]I mean, the stairs, the stairs is not a bad idea either.
[355:44.68]But there's a lot of stairs.
[355:45.74]I'm just going to build a whole bunch of archer people out here.
[355:50.76]They got a long way to go up these stairs.
[355:52.48]I feel like they get this choke point in here.
[355:55.40]And that's like the first time where it's easy to do anything about them.
[355:59.36]Because, yeah, it's really it's the stairs.
[356:02.61]So, I mean, I'm just going to pick a spot downstairs on my side and just hope it works.
[356:11.95]You know what I'm saying?
[356:13.79]I know what you're saying.
[356:15.09]We could block the top, somebody's saying, and then they'll just have to go around the entire other side.
[356:21.03]Just put barricades up so they have to literally come all the way up here and walk all the way around up to the other side.
[356:26.23]That makes a lot of sense.
[356:30.16]I blocked my door.
[356:31.28]It's just this area here.
[356:32.92]Alright, in that case, I'm going to do some butterflies.
[356:36.20]Let's try it.
[356:37.52]I got lasers.
[356:42.61]You know what?
[356:50.44]Load that shit up.
[356:53.06]Butterflies.
[356:59.71]Just keep him here.
[357:00.53]Keep him sitting right here.
[357:09.41]Okay, I'm ready.
[357:13.99]Put it down!
[357:18.11]No!
[357:26.35]Ready up!
[357:27.27]I am ready!
[357:36.39]How would you fight a pack of orcs in real life?
[357:42.28]I would seduce them.
[357:44.20]Okay.
[357:46.80]I would... Yeah, I would fight them with... You'd get destroyed by a real orc.
[357:51.69]You need some sort of cunning guile or charisma.
[357:54.33]You need to riz them up.
[357:56.33]There's no way you're beating an orc in a 1v1.
[357:57.89]I don't even want to hear it.
[358:00.09]They're like, oh, weird that you would... That's the only thing I can try.
[358:03.63]They're going to kill me.
[358:05.64]I would run.
[358:07.30]Thanks for just speaking for me the whole time.
[358:09.84]Okay.
[358:09.96]Okay.
[358:11.82]I would run.
[358:14.16]That's weird.
[358:15.42]That's kind of cowardly.
[358:19.58]At least 25 times.
[358:20.02]Alright.
[358:20.38]How are you doing over there?
[358:22.78]Are you good?
[358:27.05]I goofed.
[358:28.89]Oh.
[358:29.23]They're getting in, but who cares?
[358:30.81]Oh, they're in on your side too.
[358:34.11]Okay.
[358:34.47]Yeah, I thought we were doing a choke point on the stairs because we blocked off one of the stairways.
[358:38.59]No, I fucked up.
[358:39.33]I didn't block one of the stairs.
[358:42.60]Will be fine.
[358:45.40]I blocked the doorway.
[358:46.26]Yeah, they're going away.
[358:49.06]Is there a?
[358:50.66]OK, hope we're good here.
[358:53.66]I'll be fine.
[358:54.22]Where are you?
[358:55.80]Just making shit happen over here.
[359:06.34]They're coming up.
[359:12.91]Yeah, I need help.
[359:15.69]Same.
[359:23.03]I'm okay on my side, actually.
[359:28.47]We're going to lose like one wave.
[359:32.69]It's fine.
[359:41.36]You can look at the map.
[359:42.90]Yeah.
[359:44.66]I don't have any control over this.
[359:48.44]I'm clean over here, by the way.
[359:49.54]Is that your side?
[359:50.22]I don't know.
[359:53.65]Yeah, I need help on my side.
[359:55.29]Probably need some distracting butterflies.
[360:06.11]Where are you?
[360:07.57]Oh, there's stairs.
[360:34.04]Oh, that hurts.
[360:36.40]Emergency Riz needed.
[360:37.86]Yeah.
[360:39.74]So do something quick.
[360:42.55]My side's still okay.
[360:43.87]But I have to go defend.
[360:45.65]Yeah.
[360:50.85]I believe in you.
[360:52.76]It's going pretty well over here.
[360:54.24]I got a room full of distracting butterflies and a bunch of lasers.
[360:59.78]They're not getting through this.
[361:00.88]Alright, come back.
[361:13.71]I need more mana!
[361:18.51]Like, what's wrong with that game?
[361:19.79]Look, dude, what the fuck's happening?
[361:20.83]My game.
[361:22.11]What's happening to your game?
[361:24.41]He didn't even look.
[361:26.75]How am I going to look at your game?
[361:31.78]I was flying above you.
[361:35.70]That's cute.
[361:42.12]Where do you want the choke point to be?
[361:43.72]Like here?
[361:43.98]Because I'll give you some lasers.
[361:45.72]I, I'm, I'll be fine.
[361:48.08]I just, I spent all my money on nothing and I blocked the door the wrong way.
[361:52.58]Well, you can have that.
[361:54.56]No, here's, here's, I just need to block my stairs so they go up your stairs.
[361:58.08]Okay.
[362:00.58]Yeah.
[362:00.88]That's, that's what I'm doing.
[362:02.13]So I, am I safe to get rid of all the things I put here?
[362:05.17]Yeah.
[362:05.31]Alright.
[362:08.73]Okay.
[362:09.03]And now I need to go find where my useless rows of archers are.
[362:16.26]You have orange cream mini Twizzlers.
[362:18.10]Why does that sound amazing?
[362:21.46]Orange cream mini Twizzlers.
[362:26.47]That sounds great.
[362:29.03]Are they not even on my side?
[362:30.47]Brother.
[362:45.68]This is going to hurt my eyes.
[362:51.48]I love traps.
[362:54.10]Yeah, I built all of my archers on your side.
[362:56.24]That's what we want to do, though, right?
[363:00.99]Because theoretically, they all should be coming up this way.
[363:04.61]Don't even worry about it.
[363:05.87]Don't even like just say less.
[363:10.89]Hey, I've already ready to go.
[363:14.10]I'm spending I have ten thousand to spend oh my god just give me a second just please obama's in the chat hey what's up obama I'm feeling this one
[363:44.89]What do you got cooking up here?
[363:47.98]I'm calling them in.
[363:49.24]Because I can hear how impatient you are.
[363:51.56]No, no.
[363:51.90]I was just curious about what your plan was.
[363:54.48]We're a team.
[363:55.94]You need to tell me your plan.
[363:57.24]I'm teaming up with you.
[363:59.15]I'm teaming up.
[364:00.11]You want me to put down the... You want me to put down the Riz here.
[364:03.35]Is what you're saying.
[364:04.39]Down here.
[364:05.29]We're going to Riz them up here.
[364:07.25]Did I say it right?
[364:10.98]I think so.
[364:16.46]Stop that.
[364:17.20]Stop.
[364:17.64]Stop it right now.
[364:21.38]I don't... Okay, Grandpa.
[364:28.51]The old man thinks he's hip with the kids.
[364:33.77]But when... Hold on.
[364:34.47]When Ster says it, that's okay.
[364:35.91]But what you guys don't understand is Ster is also in his 30s.
[364:40.12]You're a lot older than me.
[364:42.84]Not by very much.
[364:44.05]I'm 23.
[364:46.47]I'm young and hip, and it's totally normal for me to go rollerblading.
[364:49.89]It doesn't matter how old you are.
[364:52.07]You can go rollerblading.
[364:57.11]That's what I'm saying.
[364:58.19]But I also just happen to be 23.
[365:12.06]Bring him into the fucking electricity chamber.
[365:15.90]The gondola of pain.
[365:22.53]This actually does hurt to look at.
[365:35.40]I can't tell if the butterflies are good because I think they're doing something decent.
[365:41.57]They open up and they go over there and look at it and they just stare at it for a few seconds.
[365:45.90]Uh, I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess if they're in the death zone.
[365:51.52]I really can't look at this.
[365:53.28]I know, it kind of hurts.
[366:09.44]Cast the spell!
[366:12.58]someone for god's sake cast a fucking spell or something help yeah I like this where they all come up one tiny simple path and then we win the game I don't know if this is killing them no it's just making this take longer but I have to do it for the achievement
[366:46.46]I wonder if it's up that high if it'll still work I think so
[367:21.14]Alright, goop is down.
[367:21.86]Nice.
[367:23.52]Yeah, I think I'm stalling this wave.
[367:30.46]I apologize.
[367:34.84]No, this is better than losing.
[367:36.74]No, I mean, I keep pushing them off and they don't die and they have to walk back up the stairs again.
[367:41.16]Yeah, but it'll be a trail of them coming up eventually.
[367:46.10]But then I push them off again.
[367:49.69]Better than losing.
[367:57.58]Pull back.
[367:58.98]I get a heal in 10 seconds.
[368:11.27]Oh, I couldn't heal you.
[368:18.57]What a shame.
[368:22.97]Unleash the horde.
[368:23.67]We're ready.
[368:25.36]Off we go.
[368:28.84]I'm going to stop pushing them.
[368:33.68]Put the snow things down?
[368:34.88]Actually, if I want to push them, I should do it here so they die.
[368:39.37]I didn't level it up.
[368:54.58]you good oh I wanted to sell these I guess I can't yeah I'm good I have a strat I need eight hundred dollars
[369:44.59]Oh, I have to like, I'm just gonna look this way and just hope that I'm winning.
[369:58.83]Honestly, the blunderbuss or the shotgun or whatever it is with points in it is probably unbelievable.
[370:06.17]I haven't touched anything besides the bow and sword and ice.
[370:09.91]It's a shotgun and then it's got a grenade launcher and the grenade launcher just does so much damage.
[370:14.07]It's got a huge blast radius still.
[370:17.67]Heal me!
[370:18.99]It's not up yet.
[370:19.67]Heal me!
[370:21.81]Five seconds.
[370:24.31]You alive?
[370:24.67]I guess I'll heal myself.
[370:28.14]It wasn't up yet.
[370:31.10]So greedy.
[370:43.65]End the stream.
[370:44.19]I end the stream when I want to end the stream.
[370:48.96]I need to go to bed.
[370:49.84]End your stream.
[371:01.30]It's past Otto's bedtime.
[371:05.02]True.
[371:14.67]So what was the deal with the hammer?
[371:16.15]It kind of stinks.
[371:21.33]Maybe with the other upgrades in it is better.
[371:25.55]So it's a whirlwind, but the whirlwind doesn't really do a whole lot of damage and it takes mana to do it.
[371:31.70]Kind of like, eh.
[371:33.30]Other things have such a better secondary.
[371:36.68]It hits her a lot, but it's kind of slow, too.
[371:39.50]Eh, it's okay. ...
[372:05.87]I hope Otto's doing good.
[372:09.47]Yeah, he's doing great.
[372:12.23]I got a heal for you in three seconds.
[372:17.75]Yeah, you better.
[372:22.99]I guess you can't get stunned while you are in the whirlwind, so that's kind of a big deal.
[372:27.01]So the big guys cannot stop you.
[372:29.09]I thought the big deal was that it said it knocked things away.
[372:34.80]uh it probably does that too have I shit myself yet like once an hour ago but only a little bit big or small I can take them all down yeah I mean you it's okay though what's a little between friends perfect I didn't say anything there's a sprint button
[373:03.81]Alright, is that as bad as me not knowing that you can headshot people?
[373:08.10]Have you been sprinting?
[373:09.84]No.
[373:13.34]So you didn't know that either?
[373:17.30]Yeah, but at least you had something too.
[373:20.34]Oh, that's so good!
[373:21.14]At least you had something too.
[373:22.57]We never pressed shift.
[373:26.25]It's so fast, dude.
[373:27.43]Hold on, we've just been... We've been like Diablo II walking?
[373:31.95]Yeah.
[373:35.71]Wow, I can't believe we didn't press the button.
[373:44.28]I was really like this level takes so long to walk around.
[373:47.36]Does it use mana?
[373:49.88]No, you can just sprint forever, man.
[373:53.00]You really can.
[373:54.08]Technology these days.
[373:55.76]Almost six and a half hours and we pressed shift for the first time in six and a half hours.
[374:01.25]That's incredible.
[374:02.95]You even knew what button it was.
[374:04.57]Yeah, it told us that in the very beginning.
[374:07.07]That's so weird that both of us didn't do it once.
[374:10.07]Why?
[374:11.59]Self-imposed.
[374:12.31]That's crazy.
[374:13.75]I can't believe we did that.
[374:19.19]Well.
[374:19.79]Hey, well, we made it this far.
[374:24.09]Apparently you don't need it.
[374:26.19]Not one time.
[374:29.96]Six hours of RP walking.
[374:32.20]I know.
[374:32.58]What are we doing?
[374:34.04]The older games had a sprint.
[374:35.91]I know for sure.
[374:36.59]And I've done it.
[374:58.81]We have to be the only sorry motherfuckers in this whole world that have... Honestly, a developer probably can like... Oh, let's take a look at the game analytics and see.
[375:07.29]These two clowns have not hit the sprint button for the entire time they've played.
[375:11.84]And I'm not even talking once.
[375:13.76]Go through this whole VOD.
[375:15.84]I have not sprinted once ever not one time I gotta go kill this special guy no I mean like to realize I could do it a second ago I pressed it once like shift by accident and my character moved weird I was like what was that you and I just created a game development study on hold on why was that why did they do that a customer did that why fast for some reason why
[375:44.66]Where is this guy who's destroying everything?
[375:48.89]I think they're going up.
[375:50.37]I think they broke.
[375:51.05]What?
[375:52.99]No, they didn't.
[375:53.45]No, everything's good.
[375:54.13]Everything's good.
[375:55.49]My stomach just went... This is also why...
[376:00.01]in game development you make things like excessively easy and you you get the zelda games where you have the characters hand holding you that everyone hates but like we we're the reason we're contributing to that we are actually the reason why the game freezes and says hey press the sprint button right now or you cannot go to the next screen
[376:22.65]It's pretty incredible we beat that hard level.
[376:24.99]We beat that hard ass level without sprinting once.
[376:29.73]That's an achievement.
[376:31.93]That's unbelievable.
[376:32.97]I actually cannot fucking believe that.
[376:48.59]We wonder why it was so hard.
[376:49.89]Man, this game is so hard.
[376:51.69]We would like running around.
[376:53.16]I hated this level because of how big it was.
[376:55.28]It feels so big and empty and there's no way to get around.
[376:58.03]I didn't like it.
[376:59.38]I was like, this is kind of awkward.
[377:00.68]It's a good thing we can lock up that one door.
[377:03.56]You guys are the reason why the Resident Evil barrels are bright yellow.
[377:09.38]No, that's because of how the contrast is different in... No, there's a real reason for that.
[377:16.51]Did you play Resident Evil 4?
[377:18.27]I did not.
[377:20.61]Did you ever play any of the Resident Evil games?
[377:23.83]I played Resident Evil 1.
[377:28.82]those are great I feel like he was I've watched them be played and I enjoy watching them but I just I don't the moment a puzzle shows up I'm gonna quit I'd rather just watch it like the moment I have to match like a green gem red gem and a blue gem what ordered like I'm out I'm just you know what
[377:52.50]That's fair.
[377:54.36]Well, when you get there, just hand it to me and I'll do it for you.
[377:56.02]I'm pretty good at those.
[377:58.94]That's a good two-star mission.
[378:04.02]We got the thing that I wanted.
[378:06.18]Scramble unlocked.
[378:07.25]What is Scramble?
[378:10.83]I don't know.
[378:11.15]Aren't you excited?
[378:12.91]What is it?
[378:18.76]Reduce damage while spinning.
[378:21.24]First, move speed while spinning.
[378:22.90]I'm not a big fan of the hammer.
[378:24.86]I really don't like it.
[378:25.42]Alright, dude.
[378:29.14]I'm going to get going.
[378:30.82]Really?
[378:31.10]Yeah.
[378:32.38]I'm getting tired.
[378:34.22]Really?
[378:37.03]Are you still swimming?
[378:40.18]uh I would feel weird playing Orcs Must Die without you now I'm gonna go to bed it's late for me you know I'm I'm an early I'm an early sleeper you got me out here at midnight oh it is is it midnight yeah I always forget that being on the west coast you're always just time travel behind everybody in the united states
[379:04.53]Alright.
[379:05.63]Well, no, no, I think you're on on the west coast.
[379:10.27]Oh, I see.
[379:10.85]Okay, seriously.
[379:12.13]Yeah, like I'm Yeah, also, if you're saying that's like, Oh, I'll host you like I'm done.
[379:16.58]Like if you hosted me and I didn't play five minutes at Freddy's.
[379:20.36]Yeah, that's disgusting.
[379:21.42]There'd be an uproar there would.
[379:24.36]You'd look over a chat and be like, when is he playing five minutes of Freddy's five minutes of Freddy's?
[379:28.23]Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[379:32.58]Yeah, it's game over.
[379:34.58]We'll figure out when to do it.
[379:36.42]But that was a lot of fun.
[379:37.18]I actually had a really good time.
[379:39.00]Yeah, same.
[379:39.60]That's a great game.
[379:42.04]Maybe we can play it again.
[379:43.02]Hey, maybe we play this before Five Nights at Freddy's again and just play this for six or seven hours again and not play Five Nights at Freddy's for a second time in a row.
[379:51.16]There's two DLCs to the game as well.
[379:53.44]I heard one of them was bad, but one of them's good.
[379:57.66]So, a lot of content.
[379:59.24]Anyway, bye.
[380:00.32]I'm going to let you go.
[380:01.99]Let me know anything.
[380:05.51]Yeah.
[380:06.33]Thanks for playing, Ster.
[380:07.67]Yeah.
[380:07.81]Yeah.
[380:07.91]Everybody say bye to Ster.
[380:10.29]Oh, a closing statement?
[380:11.27]Mm-hmm.
[380:12.37]Good night.
[380:13.82]That's a pretty good closing statement.
[380:15.82]See you later, Ster.
[380:20.28]Alright.
[380:22.14]Yeah, that was fun.
[380:23.94]That was a good time.
[380:25.42]Thanks for watching because that is going to be it.
[380:28.84]How many levels are there in this game, in the base game?
[380:32.51]18.
[380:32.53]And then there's DLC.
[380:39.40]Cool.
[380:42.94]We got pretty far then.
[380:44.40]We're almost near the end, if that's the case.
[380:51.52]But yeah, I will see you guys later.
[380:52.80]I'm going to take a break for a while.
[380:57.42]Probably like four or five days.
[380:58.94]Actually, the next time you see me, it might just be Five Nights at Freddy's, Mr. Imagining that might happen.
[381:05.28]Oh, not VRB.
[381:05.96]What am I doing?
[381:11.80]I want to reiterate one more time.
[381:15.71]Get back out of here.
[381:17.59]I want to say this one more time because I don't know how many people trickled in during the stream, but at the very beginning, I want to say the thing that I said before.
[381:24.82]If you have, if you were part of the presale and you bought Grotto Beasts and you had a March estimated ship date,
[381:34.39]Represent is going to be in contact.
[381:36.41]They're going to be sending out an email tomorrow.
[381:38.77]There was a shipping problem that they had.
[381:41.19]It was an error or whatever it was.
[381:43.93]I mean, we obviously know.
[381:46.47]But there's going to be an explanation.
[381:49.93]And we're going to be, as soon as humanly possible, putting a shitload of resource into it.
[381:57.86]Expediting as fast as we can.
[381:59.42]The March estimated orders...
[382:04.30]We're all very aware of what's going on over there.
[382:07.14]And if you were part of the March estimated ship date, you're going to get an email tomorrow explaining sort of the next steps.
[382:17.62]If there were two estimated ship dates, I'm sure you probably know there was a May, somewhere mid to late May was an estimated ship date.
[382:24.54]If you are one of these people that was affected by this, you are not going to have to wait until May.
[382:30.68]You're not going to have to wait until the end of May.
[382:33.03]These people, these early orders that had some kind of problem with the shipping, with the error, whatever happened with represent, they're going to tell you, and we're going to go from there, we're going to expedite those orders first.
[382:55.05]That's what's going to happen.
[382:56.29]You're going to get your order.
[382:58.47]It's not a May estimated ship date.
[383:00.27]I've seen that question pop up a lot.
[383:02.41]Obviously, it's been pretty frustrating.
[383:03.77]It's been pretty stressful.
[383:05.61]That's something I did not want to have happen.
[383:08.05]But it did.
[383:09.94]It did.
[383:11.62]And Represent is going to figure it out and fix it.
[383:15.52]So that's all we know.
[383:17.54]That's what we're going on.
[383:21.86]Who is he talking to?
[383:28.06]And again, thankfully, the amount of these early orders that have not been fulfilled yet, it is a manageable amount of orders.
[383:36.02]So we can expedite this process and make sure that you get product.
[383:44.13]So it'll all be explained in an email that you'll get from Represent Tomorrow.
[383:49.33]It's frustrating, and I'm obviously pretty upset about it, but it is what it is.
[383:54.41]We're doing everything we can to make sure that whoever is part of this group in March, for the March estimated orders, they get it as soon as fucking humanly possible.
[384:03.06]As soon as possible.
[384:08.06]So just keep an eye on your email, and we'll go from there.
[384:16.72]so confused all you need to know the march estimated orders there was a error on represents front where they were fulfilling orders in the wrong order is essentially how it played out and they're going to explain that to you and we're going to go from there we're going to try to make everybody happy
[384:38.07]Trust me when I say this has been the thing that me, Holly, Jake, we've been on this all day, every day for two weeks, trying to get this situated.
[384:53.58]But the problem, everybody's aware of this problem now, and we're just going to fix it.
[385:00.26]So there you go.
[385:06.16]Is your mic cutting out?
[385:07.14]Wait, really?
[385:08.55]Shouldn't be.
[385:20.04]Oh, you're good.
[385:20.56]Okay.
[385:23.40]But yeah.
[385:24.30]Also, if you want to keep up to date on a lot of this stuff, we, uh, the whole team has been talking in the Grotto Beasts chat that's in the Discord.
[385:34.30]We're giving updates there pretty much every few hours as we get them.
[385:37.98]So, let's just go from here.
[385:40.90]I'm very confident that we'll get this situated very quickly.
[385:50.31]And, obviously, this is not the way I wanted it to play out.
[385:55.67]But it is manageable enough that we can fix it in a relatively short period of time.
[386:01.38]Because a lot of people have gotten it already.
[386:03.56]And a lot of people have shared wonderful, wonderful things.
[386:07.10]All their unboxings and all their cards they're getting.
[386:09.67]And it's awesome.
[386:10.77]And we're super fucking excited to see people having a good time with it.
[386:15.05]But there are people that were early orders that got sort of left out.
[386:21.73]And that makes me unhappy.
[386:23.67]So I'm doing everything in my power to make sure that that is fixed as soon as fucking humanly possible.
[386:29.66]Alright.
[386:30.95]Have a great night.
[386:32.43]I'm going to take a little bit of a break.
[386:34.45]Not long, maybe like four days, five days.
[386:37.61]But this whole last two weeks, I feel like I've been running essentially in a full sprint.
[386:44.00]Obviously, part of the reason why you didn't see me for a while before was getting some other Gartleby stuff situated, the commercial stuff.
[386:49.68]And I think I want to take a little bit of time, at least a few days, probably three or four days at least.
[386:54.50]Keep an eye on the sus.
[386:57.18]Take care of yourselves.
[386:57.84]Call your mother.
[386:59.53]Thank you for watching.
[387:02.85]And again, if you know somebody that has a March estimated ship date that is like, where's my order?
[387:08.54]Let them know to keep an eye on their email as of tomorrow.
[387:15.84]Thanks, guys.
[387:16.76]See you soon.
[387:17.62]See you in at least three or four days.
[387:23.18]Have a great evening.
[387:24.49]Have a great night.
[387:27.17]And yeah, let's fucking go.
[387:28.45]Five Nights at Freddy's coming up soon.
[387:30.09]We're screwed.
[387:44.11]I'm going to laugh so hard if we do this again.
[387:47.29]And we just play Forks Must Die.
[387:51.49]Is Five Nights at Freddy's Watch Along with Ster going to be the new thing that just never happens?
[387:55.70]We just do other stuff every single time it might be.
[387:58.78]We'll have to find out.
[388:01.34]Alright.
[388:04.46]Take care of yourselves.
[388:05.25]See you later.
[388:05.61]Call your mother.
[388:07.57]Said it already, but I'll say it again.
[388:08.55]Have a good night.
[388:19.08]Thank you.
[388:54.04]you
