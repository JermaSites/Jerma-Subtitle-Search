[00:02.69]What is Sicko Mode?
[00:05.14]What is that?
[00:05.56]I just keep seeing it.
[00:12.82]I don't know what it is.
[00:13.64]Is it a SpongeBob reference?
[00:19.70]I see it on SpongeBob videos.
[00:23.10]Yes.
[00:26.54]Yeah, it's a rap song from SpongeBob.
[00:33.57]You are sick, so you are in the sick mode.
[00:37.13]Yeah, I'm sick in a couple of strange ways.
[00:44.50]Somebody just followed!
[00:45.46]Eh, we gotta follow!
[00:47.22]I can't be loud.
[00:50.00]I'll explain what's going on.
[00:51.02]To everybody that's out of the loop.
[00:53.34]Like, where the fuck has he been for three days?
[00:55.80]Yeah.
[00:56.16]Let's just wait.
[00:57.16]Let's just, like, let some people trickle in.
[00:58.74]And we'll discuss.
[01:01.23]All these things, okay?
[01:02.40]See you in just a second.
[01:39.70]Hey, so I'm seeing some people say it was the Seaman, Mike, and I hate to think that that's even remotely possible.
[01:49.92]No, I don't think it was.
[01:52.32]This is, uh, that would be horrible.
[01:55.78]I would not sleep for the rest of my life if I knew that that's what it was.
[02:02.28]If I actually shoved the butthole mic up the ass in the mouth... That would have been really bad.
[02:07.06]This is not even an M-rated stream.
[02:09.28]I gotta... What am I doing?
[02:10.60]You know?
[02:13.46]This is not a... I'm not one of those, like, 18-plus streams.
[02:16.90]I better cut it out.
[02:23.08]We said the F-word.
[02:24.82]Which is... Was that 18?
[02:31.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:32.50]They said fucking Venom.
[02:35.78]PG-13 has now allowed like two or three fucks and shits, right?
[02:44.87]Why is there not another rating?
[02:46.91]You know?
[02:49.61]There should be two more ratings.
[02:53.21]One, like 30 plus.
[02:56.65]And have it be movies like The Notebook.
[03:01.81]You can't go to that movie unless you're 30.
[03:06.71]This should be another one.
[03:07.49]Okay, so PG-13.
[03:09.55]And then you go all the way to 18?
[03:11.67]No, this should be like a... I don't know.
[03:16.99]How do you fix that?
[03:19.02]I used all my swears from today.
[03:20.98]It's called NC-17.
[03:22.70]NC-17 doesn't exist.
[03:26.00]PEGI-16!
[03:27.02]There it is.
[03:27.76]The Europeans know what they're doing.
[03:29.26]They got it right.
[03:32.67]You understand?
[03:33.07]Peggy's 16.
[03:35.52]Why do we have Peggy's 13?
[03:36.96]I don't understand.
[03:42.00]America's gotta get with the times, man.
[03:51.87]Peggy 33.
[03:57.21]You see, like, Peggy's 16.
[03:59.50]That is a God of War.
[04:02.00]Oh boy, just stabbing!
[04:05.86]The next trailer that you get at E3, PEGI 33.
[04:08.46]It's a hidden object game.
[04:13.71]Look, I see it over there!
[04:14.99]Do you see it?
[04:20.89]Anyways, let's go over a couple things before we get started with Hypnospace Enforcer.
[04:29.29]I've been gone for a few days.
[04:32.03]Not because I wanted to be gone, because I had some medical problems.
[04:37.19]Those of you that know that I have migraines.
[04:41.20]And sometimes they're okay, sometimes they're bad, sometimes they're not so bad.
[04:47.10]Usually if I have one, maybe every couple months.
[04:50.84]And what it does is it kind of puts me out of commission for six to eight hours or so.
[04:55.07]I'll be okay, and then I can get back to normal.
[04:58.34]I had a migraine two days ago.
[05:00.34]Two or three, whatever it was.
[05:02.88]It was the day after the Seaman stream.
[05:04.98]And it was the worst migraine I've had in probably three or four years.
[05:07.54]It was horrible.
[05:08.70]I feel like I was in the exorcist.
[05:12.02]I believe in exorcism now because it happened to me.
[05:14.85]A demon fucking came out of my body.
[05:16.11]There's no way it didn't.
[05:21.85]They must have been a priest.
[05:22.65]They must have been doing an exorcism two doors down.
[05:26.75]And it didn't work.
[05:28.96]The priest is sitting there going, I don't understand why this is not working.
[05:32.20]This child is obviously possessed.
[05:36.30]He ends up leaving.
[05:37.04]They have like tea and shit.
[05:38.08]And I'm just sitting there in my bed like... So priest, if you're watching, it worked.
[05:48.99]It worked on me.
[05:51.57]But it shut me off for two days.
[05:53.73]And then for some reason...
[05:56.35]All of my digestive problems came back.
[05:59.49]The next day.
[06:00.98]So I've been kind of... Working at, like, 60% the last day or two.
[06:07.28]That's why I didn't want to stream.
[06:08.22]Because I didn't want to have... Some, like, sick, shitty stream where I'm just, like, turning it on.
[06:13.99]Like, okay, guys, hold on.
[06:15.03]Here we go.
[06:16.01]Hey, guys.
[06:17.29]So we're gonna play... No.
[06:18.67]No.
[06:20.48]So what I'm gonna do is, I still feel kind of sloppy.
[06:25.79]So I don't know how long this stream is gonna be.
[06:27.31]We're just gonna kind of play it by ear.
[06:29.39]I do plan on streaming tomorrow.
[06:33.60]and maybe the next day depends but I'm gonna take another few days off I have a couple of friends coming in like my mother's coming in soon uh over the next 30 days here my friends coming in like next week I have to be healthy so I'm gonna have to take another couple days off probably three or four days off because I want to go to the doctor and just see what the fuck's going on because this might it was the worst migraine I've had in years like I said
[07:02.10]So, pardon my absence over the next, probably, as of stream today, stream tomorrow, maybe stream the next day, and then I'm probably going to be gone for like three or four days.
[07:15.87]Can we meet your mom?
[07:18.71]Maybe.
[07:19.49]If she's comfortable doing that, maybe.
[07:22.24]I mean, you've already met her, but...
[07:24.66]Anyways, let's get started.
[07:27.32]So pardon my potential... Is he off today?
[07:32.26]He seems off today.
[07:33.74]I am, so... Just want to get that out of the way.
[07:36.55]I get to have a... That's just great.
[07:37.99]I get to have a blanket statement.
[07:39.29]Oh, you know, guys, the stream's not going to be good today.
[07:43.89]Perfect!
[07:45.93]That means you have such a low expectation.
[07:47.79]I'm going to pull the rug up from underneath you.
[07:52.73]Let's get this off.
[07:56.63]And here we are.
[08:01.15]So, what I know about this game, there's only a few things that I know, is that... Actually, I don't know anything.
[08:06.57]At all.
[08:07.53]I know this is a game where you pretend to go on the internet in the 90s and I figured it was in a slightly relaxing kind of hangout stream.
[08:17.82]And maybe it's not.
[08:18.86]Maybe I'm gonna trigger a new migraine.
[08:21.52]We'll find out.
[08:24.26]But if you weren't alive,
[08:27.17]If you're not a 90s... ...gid, then you're not gonna know what this is like.
[08:35.46]Just read the title.
[08:36.22]Okay, so I know that you're an enforcer and you have to scour the internet for bad pages.
[08:48.38]And delete them.
[08:48.96]I don't know.
[08:49.85]Okay, enter your name.
[08:51.97]Custom pronunciation?
[08:52.71]What the hell does that mean?
[08:57.20]Should it be like that?
[08:57.92]Custom pronunciation?
[09:06.95]Is that better?
[09:12.64]Nah, this is fine.
[09:20.53]What does this mean?
[09:21.13]Custom pronunciation.
[09:22.89]Jerma.
[09:28.23]Jerma.
[09:30.00]Okay.
[09:32.24]Should I have the custom pronunciation be the 985?
[09:33.76]Jerma985.
[09:33.92]No, no, no.
[09:34.16]It's not 85.
[09:34.96]Jerma985.
[09:35.26]There it is.
[09:48.99]No, I don't want him to say that.
[09:51.30]Just, Jerma was fine.

[14:05.02]Olivine Alloy Eggplant.

[14:14.19]Yep.
[14:16.83]Wow, this is really scratching the 90s computer itch.
[14:21.85]No, I don't want that one.
[14:26.59]That one's cool.
[14:30.00]Wow, computers really did suck.
[14:37.22]Kids make this shit in Roblox now.
[14:40.48]Humans are progressing too fast.
[14:45.76]Somebody set up Minecraft electricity blocks and probably made this.
[14:52.84]It's been 10 to 15 years.
[14:54.34]Why are we going so fast?
[15:01.82]What's gonna happen in, like, another 20 years?
[15:04.42]It's called Redstone.
[15:05.38]Yeah, whatever.
[15:06.49]I know.
[15:07.17]Alright.
[15:07.45]Pizazz.
[15:08.09]Mouse trail.
[15:10.11]Uh... That shit's fucking annoying.
[15:16.32]Is that... Doesn't this mean less mouse trail?
[15:25.26]No, there we go.
[15:27.04]I don't want the, like, I'm on mushrooms mouse.
[15:30.32]12 hour time, that's good.
[15:31.22]Double click icons, okay.
[15:34.04]Alright, sounds good.
[15:38.18]Nice smooth mouse experience.
[15:42.40]The streamer's on mushrooms.
[15:43.92]Set captions.
[15:45.54]Yeah, I probably should do that too, shouldn't I?
[15:50.78]Caption all hypey speech.
[15:56.16]Okay, let's go.
[15:58.61]Did I do the pizza menu?
[15:59.43]I did.
[15:59.69]Yeah, I just want to make sure.
[16:00.89]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

[16:49.31]Yep.
[16:51.19]So let's see.
[16:54.31]Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of Hypnospace citizens safe.
[16:57.87]What's a weird mind's eye, third eye thing?
[16:59.27]HypnOS Enforcer Edition is different from the standard version of HypnOS in several key areas.
[17:05.85]This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to best serve your fellow Hypnospace citizens.
[17:11.34]I'm getting some real 3D movie maker vibes.
[17:13.72]Let's do this.
[17:17.12]Alright, select a topic.
[17:17.90]Let's see.
[17:18.22]We got CHIME laws, HSPD inbox, HSPD cases, investigating citizens enforcement tools.
[17:25.09]What about, let's go laws.
[17:26.29]CHIME is an easy way to remember the five types of violations that we'd like enforcers to keep an eye out for.
[17:31.81]C stands for content infringement.
[17:34.79]H is for harassment.
[17:36.37]I for illegal activity.
[17:38.09]M for malicious software.
[17:39.83]And E is for extra legal commerce.
[17:42.63]Find more information in the HSPD handbook.
[17:44.91]Extra legal?
[17:46.26]Does that mean that a lawyer is there every time you make a transaction?
[17:50.44]He just sits there and watches you transact the money?
[17:52.10]How about it's extra legal?
[17:57.89]Beyond legal.
[17:59.63]Outside of the law.
[18:00.63]Why would it just be illegal?
[18:02.71]Sue, it's so legal.
[18:04.71]I've got a notary, a lawyer, and a doctor there watching me transact my muffin business.
[18:12.62]Alright, so content infringement.
[18:13.76]We're going to let content ID claim...
[18:17.11]Harassment, illegal content, malicious software.
[18:19.74]Alright, let's see.
[18:20.28]Click the video to pause and resume.
[18:21.92]Okay, so we... Chime.
[18:23.54]Let me see.
[18:23.82]I gotta remember that.
[18:25.46]Chime.
[18:26.20]Content infringement.
[18:27.02]I'm not looking at the screen.
[18:28.04]H. Harassment.
[18:29.48]I. Infection of software.
[18:32.27]No.
[18:32.53]Illegal content.
[18:33.33]Okay.
[18:34.33]I is illegal.
[18:38.49]M is for malicious software.
[18:39.87]E is extra legal.
[18:41.65]So why is there an I and an E?
[18:44.06]Illegal content and extra legal content.
[18:48.26]Okay, but this is commerce, so this is okay.
[18:50.04]Alright.
[18:51.72]You don't need to memorize this.
[18:52.98]Oh, alright.
[18:54.60]Never mind.
[18:57.73]Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of Hypnospace citizens safe.
[19:03.37]HypnOS Enforcer Edition is different from the standard version of HypnOS in several key areas.
[19:09.98]This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to best serve your fellow hypno...
[19:14.98]the hspd enforcer dashboard is a special secure program that only our volunteer enforcers have access to nice the inbox allows you to receive messages from Merchantsoft Hypnospace or hspd dispatch agents
[19:29.03]You may also receive automated communications from hypnostate pages.
[19:33.07]Some messages come with files attached.
[19:36.05]Attached files will appear at the top of the message and look like this.
[19:40.63]Attached files will be downloaded to your HypnOS download manager.
[19:44.87]Then what am I supposed to do?
[19:50.60]read message sent from the dispatch to or automated communications from hypnosis based pages.
[19:55.66]Some messages contain file attachments restored in the download manager.
[19:59.13]So what if if somebody sends me illegal content, we're supposed to report them?
[20:03.21]Is there a report button?
[20:07.81]The cases tab opens as a database of all cases you've accepted.
[20:11.79]Most of your time will be spent on cases assigned to you by an HSPD dispatch agent.
[20:17.09]Cases are generated in response to complaints from Hypnospace citizens or leads from the Hypnospace security team.
[20:24.90]Once a violation has been found, the offending citizen's name will be listed here.
[20:30.06]Click to jump to the page where the violation was removed from.
[20:35.53]Once all reported violations have been found in a case, you may close it by clicking the close case button.
[20:41.48]Okay, so you're going to find violations.
[20:42.76]Upon closing a case, you will earn a bonus payout of five HypnoCoin per violation reported.
[20:48.66]Bitco coins.
[20:49.58]Bitco coins.
[20:50.98]Alright.
[20:52.24]So, this is the main portion of the... Okay, let's think about this.
[20:56.70]You get cases.
[20:57.92]You've got to investigate.
[20:58.72]You've got to get evidence.
[21:00.12]And then you get Bitco coins.
[21:03.68]Got it.
[21:06.26]So let's look at it.
[21:07.10]Inbox cases, we did this already.
[21:09.67]Investigating citizens, here we go.
[21:10.79]Search illegal.
[21:11.09]Good times scam watch.
[21:11.69]Bad Citizen McGee's page.
[21:12.61]Bad citizens.
[21:13.07]Yeah, I'm bad, so... Don't you know anything about being illegal?
[21:16.49]Why would you put illegal content in the metadata tags of your website?
[21:37.43]View the stamped page list to revisit your stamped pages.
[21:42.31]Okay.

[37:45.58]Gumshoe Gooper!
[37:47.70]Look at that!
[37:48.34]You're under arrest.
[38:07.42]My first grade students made this artwork after watching a Gumshoe Gooper feature about being safety-minded in all kinds of different situations.
[38:14.25]It's old, but such a cute little cartoon.
[38:17.63]Gumshoe Gooper is the police.
[38:19.31]He catches the pig robber and puts him in handcuffs.
[38:23.23]Fucking violation, kid.
[38:26.63]Gumshoe Gooper and his friends in court, everyone cheers for Gumshoe Gooper.
[38:31.89]You're going to jail.
[38:34.35]Oh no, watch out for Gumshoe!
[38:37.05]You made this?
[38:38.51]That's pretty impressive for a six-year-old.
[38:40.79]Help!
[38:42.25]The boy in the building is stuck and Gumshoe Gooper hears him yell help and calls 911.
[38:45.37]Gumshoe Gooper does not try to play with a dog all by himself, even if it is nice.
[38:52.97]Is this real artwork, you think?
[38:59.49]Gumshoe Gooper finds a bag with bad stuff.
[39:01.79]He tells a grown-up and they throw the bad stuff in the trash can.
[39:04.95]The end.
[39:06.27]A carrot?
[39:09.18]Really?
[39:14.54]Interesting.

[39:59.49]Mechanical click?
[40:01.49]Hammer on the top left.

[40:04.48]I'm just writing down Noble Warlock Designs.
[40:08.04]Oh.
[40:14.05]Yeah, but look at this font, though.
[40:16.67]That could be, like, globlin.
[40:20.31]That's a lowercase n. Look, I'm just trying to do it correct, okay?
[40:27.99]First of all, I thought I was gonna have to go search for it.
[40:31.99]Listen, alright, we got content ID.
[40:35.17]Content infringement.
[40:37.55]Content infringement.
[40:38.35]There it is.
[40:40.23]Bang.
[40:42.74]Uh, I, Jerma, submit this evidence as proof that CitizenAbbyRights58 has violated content infringement.
[40:53.15]Investigation well done, Enforcer.
[40:54.61]Get paid.
[40:57.13]Oh, they take it off.
[41:00.25]Okay, wait, does this- is this fair use?
[41:03.67]Is that fair use?
[41:04.79]This is fa- what, okay, draw a depiction of a character.
[41:06.95]Is it fair use?
[41:10.61]If I draw a picture,
[41:13.49]A terrible photo of Sonic the Hedgehog.
[41:17.11]And I have him have handcuffs in his hand.
[41:22.46]I'm not selling it, though.
[41:23.54]Nobody... Hold on.
[41:24.18]This is all bullshit.
[41:26.56]This website doesn't cost any money.
[41:27.86]I don't think that's infringement.
[41:36.55]This... Yeah, I'm... Shut it down?
[41:44.38]This kid didn't even... has violated... Well done.
[41:53.73]It's infringement.
[41:56.19]Shit, it is.
[41:58.05]This is unbelievable.
[41:59.07]Did I really just DMCA claim a six-year-old?
[42:22.82]Alright, I'm getting lots of money here.
[42:27.47]Take it all down.
[42:28.61]This is not even... I don't like this.
[42:35.62]This is fair use.
[42:36.78]They're not doing this for... Is that... Alright.
[42:39.94]This could be an ice cream.
[42:43.70]I don't think this one counts.
[42:47.83]That doesn't even look remotely like Gumshoe Goober.
[42:51.49]I mean, it says the words Gumshoe Gooper, but I don't think this is infringement.
[43:06.71]I see, I told you.
[43:09.14]Damn it, I should have listened.
[43:12.50]That didn't look any, okay, hold on.
[43:14.56]Is it illegal to write the word Gumshoe Gooper?
[43:17.78]I got mail?
[43:18.84]Uh-oh.
[43:30.54]Okay, now I know what is and what isn't illegal.
[43:32.90]This is illegal.
[43:36.24]I knew it, too.
[43:44.35]Yeah.
[43:45.63]Okay, the end.
[43:46.29]Here we go.
[43:47.11]Alright, so I got... Hold on, let me go see the mail.
[43:50.69]Wait a minute.
[43:55.43]Oh, shit.
[43:56.09]Okay, hold on.

[71:15.90]That's not illegal, that's just sad.
[71:18.09]Alright, we're gonna find this secret page.
[71:26.87]Seepage, right?
[71:27.65]Like, that's his favorite band.
[71:29.63]Seepage review.
[71:32.31]Wait a minute.
[71:35.65]Scanning new music reviews.
[71:37.09]Any page designers out there that can advise me?
[71:39.01]I'm not used to using this page builder.
[71:42.31]Is he going to be seen talking shit?
[71:43.81]Like freaking out in the comments section?
[71:52.03]Seepage review.
[71:52.73]Heavy brooding hybrid rock rap for the teenage set.
[72:00.71]Okay.
[72:02.66]Scrape Records.
[72:03.64]It's easy to immediately dismiss bands that have such a blatantly manufactured facade, but to do this with Seepage would be a mistake.
[72:09.98]The group's image may not age well.
[72:11.52]I believe that their music will be remembered as something special.
[72:15.40]Seepage's debut self-titled record is packed with inventive production.
[72:21.00]Inspired fusion of heavy riffs and hip-hop beats.
[72:23.19]Okay.
[72:26.11]The lyrics are not technically impressive.
[72:27.83]We're looking for a name of a record or a name of a song.
[72:31.51]No.
[72:31.67]Yeah, this definitely... I would say, like, the comments section.
[73:00.38]Of this guy.
[73:01.14]Because he's probably going to be like, FUCK YOU, IT'S MY FAVORITE BAND!
[73:08.98]House of Sound.
[73:13.22]Jot'em in the seepage.
[73:16.24]Please note... Under heavy construction, I'm working... Yeah, this is the seepage review, but is there a comment section here?
[73:28.77]Scrubby Scrape Records?
[73:35.37]I'm looking for him to like scream at this guy for making a bad review.
[73:46.49]Let me go back to his page.

[80:23.95]Uh, just being fat and popping pimples on girls.

[96:31.90]And yeah, when is St.

[96:46.38]Damn, okay.
[96:48.12]Nah, I'm not gonna be drinking.
[96:50.60]I'm too fucked up for that.
[96:53.00]So, I'll be just, like, hanging out on St.
[96:55.04]Patrick's Day.
[96:55.92]Watching TV or something.
[96:59.64]But, we're good.
[97:00.44]I'm probably gonna be streaming, actually.

[99:41.38]Open-eyed is for you.
[99:42.52]This is a non-judgmental zone for all free thinkers.
[99:47.86]Alright, there are a lot of pages that I keep just passing by.
[99:51.48]For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in threret.
[100:02.57]Matthew 7.13, the word shall not return void.
[100:09.52]Look out ministries.
[100:11.70]Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.
[100:20.07]That was from Peter.
[100:21.35]Is this Elvis?
[100:23.21]Is this Elvis?
[100:23.73]150,000 people die every day.
[100:24.71]One day it will be you.
[100:27.16]Do you know where you will end up?
[100:39.54]What?
[100:40.20]The page cannot be found.
[100:41.24]Go back.
[100:41.62]Is this a dead link?
[100:49.68]Notice, Lookout Ministries did not choose to be a part of the open-eyed zone and has kindly requested that our page be relocated to Good Time Valley.
[100:58.47]I will not remake the whole thing.
[101:00.09]We do not agree with the things that they allow in here.
[101:04.25]This is how to be saved.
[101:07.05]The Squisher's Deception.
[101:10.66]about Lookout Ministries.
[101:12.24]Lookout Ministries is a Bible-believing non-denominational ministry led by the Holy Spirit.
[101:18.69]It was formed by evangelist teacher and prophet Todd, who received the Holy Spirit at the age of 17 after being miraculously delivered from the brink of death after a drug overdose.
[101:30.79]Dr. Hall knows what it's like to serve the father of lies, and it ain't pretty.
[101:38.55]Pastor Todd.
[101:39.77]Wait, this is Todd.
[101:41.79]This is the guy who owns the website.
[101:48.06]Angels in the Bible do not look like cute... Angels in the Bible do not look like cute little girls with little instruments and flowers.
[101:57.72]This is a lie.
[101:58.48]From who?
[101:59.18]Fire?
[101:59.40]Is this bad?
[102:07.66]From you-know-who, devil, okay.
[102:09.61]This is kind of a violation.
[102:13.39]I will gladly share my testimony.
[102:17.82]Alright.
[102:18.10]Let's take a look at some of the stuff here.
[102:20.26]How to be saved.
[102:23.97]Would you like to be saved?
[102:25.41]Close your eyes and pray this to the Lord.
[102:27.73]Mean what you say.
[102:29.44]Lord Jesus, I know that I am an imperfect sinner.
[102:32.82]And unless you save me, I am lost forever.
[102:35.54]I thank you for dying for me on the cross.
[102:38.24]I come to you now, Lord, the best way I know how.
[102:41.26]And ask you to save me.
[102:42.58]I now receive you as my Savior.
[102:44.52]By the way, I'm reading this.
[102:47.30]Somebody's going to clip this and put me in front of a church or something.
[102:50.58]In your name, Jesus, I pray.
[102:52.02]Amen.
[102:55.29]I'm reading it sarcastically.
[102:56.57]No, I'm not.
[102:57.23]I'm just reading it.
[103:01.65]I'm not reading it sarcastically.
[103:05.15]Don't say it like a spell.
[103:07.04]No, I was just reading.
[103:10.18]How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[103:13.20]That was Hebrews 2.3.
[103:14.36]If you accepted Jesus into your heart, please scroll down.
[103:22.68]Congratulations, you are now part of the family of God.
[103:25.30]You are brothers with Christ and a true child of the Most High God.
[103:28.98]Welcome.
[103:29.50]Jesus loves you.
[103:33.22]Nothing illegal here.
[103:34.42]The word shall not return void.
[103:37.51]Nothing illegal.
[103:41.67]Chad, you've all been saved.
[103:44.71]Do not choose to be part... There's nothing here.
[103:46.51]This is fine.
[103:47.87]H.S.
[103:48.19]Christians.
[103:56.82]Hmm.
[103:58.01]There's got to be something fucked up here.
[104:00.97]I don't know.
[104:01.55]I don't think there is.
[104:02.63]The Squisher's Deception.
[104:04.73]Uh-oh.
[104:05.55]Well.
[104:05.65]Hmm.
[104:05.73]The Bible warns about wolves many times.
[104:26.01]It's a streamer?
[104:28.51]That's a Twitch name.
[104:32.22]That's like a top 500 Fortnite player.
[104:36.00]Has to be.
[104:39.68]And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.
[104:47.65]Revelation.
[104:48.17]Alright.
[104:50.68]That thing's zooming.
[104:52.22]How much more convincing do you need a serpent for kids to play with?
[104:57.44]If you need more evidence, let's look at its eyes for a moment.
[105:04.06]What is this?
[105:04.60]I don't understand what this is a picture of.
[105:10.88]A Squisher Z's?
[105:14.88]Is it a cartoon or something?
[105:17.68]The snake's eye very clearly drawn to look like the Egyptian third eye.
[105:23.52]Or the eye of Horus.
[105:25.29]This eye supposedly grants its viewers sight that transcends good and evil.
[105:30.11]Meaning the snake is teaching our kids that good and evil do not exist.
[105:34.49]Who else tried to erase good and evil?
[105:37.24]I'll give you a hint.
[105:38.12]Satan did.
[105:39.26]In the garden in his serpent form.
[105:42.37]Then the serpent said to the woman, you will not surely die.
[105:45.91]For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[105:53.04]That's from Genesis 3, 4, 6.
[105:57.96]And we're not through yet.
[106:02.86]Let's take a closer look at this popular giraffe, Squisher.
[106:06.16]There's no way this funny looking creature can carry a hidden message, can it?
[106:09.62]I'll let you see for yourselves.
[106:12.95]Not so cute anymore, is it?
[106:18.28]No, it is not.
[106:23.83]I can't take it anymore.
[106:25.63]That's right.
[106:26.77]Pentagramic markings right on your kid's toys.
[106:29.98]How did this happen?
[106:31.34]When a generation grows up without the Lord, what do you expect?
[106:35.48]We were so busy having nice little pageants and school plays that we forgot God.
[106:40.52]Now this rebellious generation is in charge and we're reaping what we have sown.
[106:46.19]These people make the popular cartoons and movies and design the toys for our children and grandchildren.
[106:53.72]If you think these people have your kid's best interest at heart, think again.
[106:58.16]At best, they are unwitting servants of Satan.
[107:00.80]At worst, they are card-carrying members of the occult.
[107:04.28]There's a lot more where this came from.
[107:06.16]We're just getting started.
[107:11.92]Okay, well, you kind of go, Squisher Z. We're going to have to remember that and look that up.
[107:19.46]How to be saved, we got that.
[107:27.39]Copyrighted images.
[107:29.09]Hold on.
[107:31.25]Are these copyrighted?
[107:40.52]That's a copyrighted image!
[107:49.49]What?
[107:52.73]These... How is that not copyright?
[107:55.85]Does it have to be part of the case?
[107:59.98]Well, alright, you're a little weird.
[108:02.35]Let's go back.
[108:03.63]So, nothing else here seems to be out of the ordinary, though.
[108:07.41]Just somebody with a highly religious webpage that thinks the Squisher Zs are Satanic.
[108:13.13]Don't see much else.
[108:15.35]Glitch piece devil demon Squisher Z. Squisher Z world.

[112:08.71]It's so futuristic, so everyone's asleep.
[112:10.41]Interesting.
[112:13.93]Hi, I'm Rebby Ruth.
[112:15.25]My real name is Rebecca, though.
[112:16.89]I'm 16 in the 10th grade, and I'm a pastor's kid, if you couldn't tell, by the way.
[112:22.06]That means bursting with laughter, in hypno-space speak.
[112:28.22]Most of the time, I'm either doing homework, playing Squisher Z, or playing piano with a youth praise band.
[112:33.52]Our band name is called Called Out.
[112:36.86]See you around.
[112:38.86]I'm not allowed to message or use chitchat here, so if you want to talk to me, you can't.
[112:43.23]And that's me.
[112:45.73]My brother has this on a shirt.
[112:49.03]Babble... I bet bursting with laughter.
[112:53.23]Praise Peak Worship Company.
[112:54.59]Gotta praise him right.
[112:56.69]Okay.
[113:01.62]Has anyone heard rumors about Squishers being Satanic?
[113:04.43]I hope not because it's my favorite game and I'd be so bored without it.
[113:07.95]I have heard.
[113:11.55]My hobbies include Hypnospace.
[113:13.73]I've seen Hypnospace on TV for like a year, and I'm so glad my dad finally let me get on here now.
[113:18.58]It's so cool.
[113:20.70]My dad got me a program to draw on the computer last year, so I've been practicing that a lot.
[113:26.52]But I mostly only used to do church flyer art.
[113:29.80]Working on some of my own art soon.
[113:33.64]Squisher Z. This game is so cute.
[113:36.10]Mushi is the best Squisher Z. My cousin, he lives in the next town over.
[113:41.25]He's also a pastor's kid.
[113:42.91]Didn't want his game champ anymore, so they gave it to us.
[113:46.31]My brother thinks it's for geeks, but I've been having so much fun with it.
[113:51.44]Mushi is a method.
[113:54.84]My favorite praise song is Lord, Your Name is Lifted.
[113:59.24]But I also like old hymns like Peace, Peace, Peace.
[114:02.00]I play the piano usually, but not very good.
[114:04.37]But getting better.
[114:05.09]Anything else here?

[114:27.63]The Squisher's story.
[114:29.77]After an intergalactic war in a distant galaxy, the Squisher aliens preserved the wildlife on their now-destroyed planet by sending them to Earth in Squish capsules.
[114:39.54]It's now the job of a special group of heroic Earth teens to collect and preserve these rare, powerful creatures.

[123:00.23]Transcend until masters, with wisdom from days gone past, a tree of marmalade and peanut butter.
[123:06.62]You can take a picnic here, or just watch the stars beneath the gazebo's canopy go by.
[123:12.36]This spot is great for meditation too, it's all okay with me, I'm just glad you're here.
[123:16.44]I was gonna do it again.

[128:21.89]Welcome.
[128:22.33]I started my career as a psychic and healer 30 years ago, but I've been developing my abilities since the young age of 8.
[128:28.39]One day on a visit to a department store with my mother, I fell from a balcony and became unconscious.
[128:34.00]In my dream, I saw a bright light and heard an angelic voice.
[128:37.54]And immediately upon waking up, I knew I was different.
[128:41.66]Need answers?

[131:43.23]Oh, the text is against the law too, right?
[131:48.67]You got trouble.
[131:49.85]No, what?
[131:55.35]Okay, well...
[131:58.66]Isn't this sale of products or services through unauthorized payment processing systems?
[132:07.89]So it is just the hyperlinks.
[132:09.35]I thought it was something along the lines of all the evidence that is here.
[132:13.71]It has to be a link.
[132:15.99]Okay.
[132:17.53]Alright, you are eligible for flagging.
[132:19.98]So I'm going to flag you.

[136:23.30]It's on a bike?
[136:24.44]Is he on a bike?

[136:36.69]That's pretty talented.
[136:38.66]Electric bike with a tuba.
[136:39.94]Yeah, he just pedals by and he puts his mouth on it and just blows as hard as he can.
[136:45.94]Bike like motorcycle.

[148:32.62]Hello, dear sir or madam, please help my dream.
[148:36.20]Warmest greetings to you, Jerma.
[148:38.36]From when I was a young- From when I was a young child, I have always dreamed of becoming a treasure hunter and explorer of the seas.
[148:46.06]Unfortunately, my parents fell ill when I was but a child, and I was sent to a foster home.
[148:52.67]I did not receive the education needed to pilot a ship or submarine, so I have worked as a ladder store clerk for my whole life.
[149:00.63]I am not one to beg, but an opportunity from a wealthy stranger has presented itself to me if I am able to raise 10,000 HypnoCoin.
[149:10.91]The stranger will fully fund me and a team to go out on a submarine expedition this December.
[149:16.78]Please respond by November 27th by donating to my cause or my dream will be dashed.
[149:22.52]Hey, you don't have... You don't have... This is not, uh... Kappa Cash?
[149:30.84]If you collect a $10,000, click the button below to donate and help us achieve our goal.
[149:34.34]Thank you and God bless.

[149:55.62]Gotta help him fulfill his dream!
[149:57.64]Do not donate.
[150:00.14]What, you don't have a heart?
[150:04.22]It's either this or antivirus.
[150:08.20]Professor Helper here.
[150:09.68]Need some help?
[150:11.82]Till next time!
[150:19.32]You don't have a brain.
[150:20.70]I know this is bullshit, but does it unlock something?
[150:23.72]That's my point.
[150:26.06]If I pay this, will something interesting happen?
[150:28.75]You know, I know this is bullshit.
[150:30.05]What do you think I'm doing?
[150:31.25]Oh, yeah, I'm going to help this person in their dream of being a boat salesman.
[150:35.11]I don't even know what the hell it was.
[150:38.31]Why would it unlock something?
[150:39.31]I don't know because it says it's going to update the page.
[150:40.75]What if I come back here and it's a crypto kitty?
[150:46.43]Whatever the hell they are.
[150:52.62]It's something's gonna happen something cool is gonna happen
[151:18.68]And you guys are going to be like, oh shit, I didn't even know that was possible.
[151:20.88]I skipped that.
[151:21.56]Alright, let's give me this one.
[151:28.69]Auto-cure.
[151:29.33]Let's get the good one.
[151:36.99]What is auto-cure functionality?
[151:38.53]Okay, hold on.
[151:44.01]HypnoCure plus coming in.
[151:48.14]I see you're using HypnoCure.
[151:49.13]Yeah, I could use some help here.
[151:51.51]You gotta remove it.
[151:52.61]Get out of here.
[151:53.21]Cure me.
[152:17.37]We got trouble.
[152:18.63]Detected and cleaned the following viruses from your system.
[152:20.89]Wave hello.
[152:21.63]What do you mean wave hello?
[152:28.28]Infection alerts are active.
[152:32.86]We got trouble.
[152:34.78]How do I get rid of this?
[152:37.24]Professor Helper.
[152:38.76]Hello there.
[152:39.74]I am Professor Helper.
[152:43.68]No, how do I uninstall Professor Helper?
[152:47.58]You... Application icons can only be... removed using their official uninstaller.
[153:02.09]If available, you will be able to download the uninstaller in Hypnospace.
[153:05.42]I have to go buy the uninstaller?
[153:21.84]Good time scam watch.
[153:24.70]Professor Helper uninstall.
[153:29.14]Professor Helper is sad to see you go.
[153:30.55]We hope you've learned a lot.
[153:31.31]Do you want to tell Professor Helper if such a deed is truly your aim?
[153:36.13]Please pay a small uninstall and assistance fee of 33 points.
[153:38.79]I need 33 bucks.
[153:41.31]I don't have it.
[153:51.47]Just wait until we get an email from that boy's dream of being a salesman.
[153:58.23]And I mean S-A-I-L, not S-A-L-E, for all of you people here wondering.
[154:08.43]Flag him.
[154:08.81]He told me not to flag.
[154:11.23]Professor Helper here.
[154:13.10]Need some help?
[154:15.44]Farewell!
[154:17.88]No, but that was a fake email, though.
[154:19.56]Guys.
[154:19.80]Hold on.
[154:22.62]Look!
[154:26.40]Wowie, wow, wow, wow, wow, Jerma.
[154:28.60]Thank you, and God bless you to the maximum.
[154:31.14]It is possible in this world.
[154:32.38]I will surely share the treasure when we find it.
[154:35.25]Kindest regards, and God bless Demetri Jackson.
[154:38.93]I bet you in another couple hours of game time... Professor Helper here.
[154:43.67]Need some help?
[154:45.11]Professor Helper is always here for you.
[154:48.03]I bet you I'm going to get an email with like 500 bucks in it.
[154:54.07]And everyone's gonna be like, what?
[154:55.29]No, those things were always a scam.
[154:56.84]And I'm the guy that clicked it.
[154:57.92]Okay, we got illegal shock images.
[155:04.06]Don't click that link.
[155:05.30]Shocking image example.
[155:06.28]Downloading shock image example.
[155:09.51]What's the example they give us here?
[155:12.46]Do not visit my page right now.
[155:14.34]A virus ran a script adding a gross image to it.
[155:17.14]Good news is that the virus is simple and harmless.
[155:20.16]Adding it to hypno cure now.
[155:22.80]Bit blurred so as not to scar everyone who opens this.
[155:34.33]I don't know what that is.
[155:35.55]But it's blurred so is it like a bug?
[155:45.09]You must see this.
[155:45.91]Jump to the True Tranquility installation page.
[155:49.61]Professor Helper here.
[155:51.11]The Helping Man with the Helping Hand.
[155:54.04]Well, I am... At least I got HypnoCure!
[156:05.22]For your safety, please open HypnoCure and click Cure Me Now.
[156:15.18]Did I get to report this imagery?
[156:21.31]Illegal image.
[156:23.19]Malicious software.
[156:25.49]Malicious software.
[156:30.59]I can't even click it.
[156:31.57]What?
[156:33.31]Where is it?
[156:33.87]We're fine.
[156:34.75]We've got trouble.
[156:35.53]Festering orifice has been cleaned.
[156:59.33]We got trouble.
[157:00.47]Fine, you gotta have antivirus.
[157:04.95]I gotta get rid of this fucking annoying guy.
[157:08.87]In my brain for a second, I don't know why, but I was like, oh, I'll just sell the cheese and stuff.
[157:13.10]I thought I could just sell it.
[157:14.42]I don't know where that came from.
[157:18.18]Alright, this is a bad website.
[157:19.28]How do I flag this website?
[157:22.30]You tell me I cannot flag this website.
[157:26.43]By running this program, you accept the true tranquility terms and conditions.
[157:30.79]In mere moments, you will experience the security and peace that only true tranquility can offer.
[157:35.18]Prepare to see the unseen and hear the unheard.
[157:37.40]Well, bye then.
[157:38.70]Yeah, malicious software, right?
[157:43.44]This is not malicious software.
[157:45.85]You got trouble.
[157:46.47]No violation.
[158:02.07]How is that not a violation?
[158:09.79]Okay, I gotta delete some of these fucking emails.
[158:13.35]Welcome to a force of life.
[158:14.33]How do I remove emails?
[158:16.93]How do I remove emails?
[158:21.01]Where's the delete?
[158:21.65]Alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[158:29.42]Just take the case.
[158:30.02]Hold on, hold on.
[158:31.10]I know, I know, I know.
[158:31.78]I just need to... Is there any way I can remove emails?
[158:38.95]No.
[158:40.05]Alright, new case.
[158:41.27]I still have the old one open, though.
[158:43.93]I think we're good to close this.
[158:44.89]There's no more Kappa Cash.
[158:47.93]Well, that might not be true.
[158:53.72]This is an illegal content notice regarding disturbing images that may be in any zone.
[158:57.80]Please look for violations and utilize your enforcement tool.
[159:01.36]Hey, Dylan here.
[159:01.96]Looks like a few citizen pages were hacked by that same True Tranquility guy.
[159:07.20]While you can comb through every single page to check for the images, you might want to start by investigating the hacker first.
[159:15.07]Hackers like this are always bragging or posting serial killerish cat and mouse games with hints.
[159:21.96]I would love to go hunting for nasty shock images, but I have a lot of programming to finish today.
[159:27.39]Plus, that's why we pay you, sort of.
[159:29.31]Haha.
[159:30.87]The image isn't quite illegal, but we're going to categorize it as such for the case.
[159:37.83]I've attached a blurry screenshot of what the thing looked like on my page, and added Cool Punk Paradise to your assigned zones.
[159:47.50]This case has been manually assigned to all enforcers.
[159:50.38]Click the Cases tab to view your progress.
[159:53.90]Just flag them already.
[159:54.80]Alright, hold on, let me take that case.
[160:01.46]I'm closing this one.
[160:06.79]This one's good to go.
[160:07.61]I mean, I can just keep it open, right?
[160:10.99]So, shocking or violating images.
[160:13.27]Disturbing or violent pornographic images.
[160:16.23]Illegal content notice.
[160:18.05]So, I'm already on his webpage.
[160:22.91]Let's see.
[160:26.10]This is HS Citizen 066 A325B.
[160:39.59]Type something here to update your fellow syndicated.
[160:41.51]It's just a default page.
[160:45.14]Can I, like, search for this?
[160:53.32]Zero years old, undefined.
[160:55.60]Get the fuck out of here.
[161:00.21]014 Topia.
[161:03.15]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[161:05.01]Okay.
[161:05.27]Hmm.
[161:10.82]So, Teentopia 4.
[161:11.82]Oh, for Teentopia.
[161:25.27]I mean, there's another one.
[161:26.71]They added a new place.
[161:27.63]But, I'm like, I'm skipping too fast.
[161:44.89]Dude, you got trouble.
[161:46.37]Fuck you, Professor Helper.
[161:53.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:53.75]Is that the... Okay, wait, wait.
[161:54.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[161:55.24]That takes his page... Does that take his page down?
[162:01.18]How do I get there?
[162:01.80]It's gonna take his page down.
[162:05.72]And I'm not gonna be able to uninstall this.
[162:07.20]Um, how do I make money right now?
[162:13.70]I gotta close that case right now and get the money and pay for this right now.
[162:16.92]That's it?
[162:17.52]Wow, that's it?
[162:18.02]Mostly removed from your system.
[162:21.00]What does that mean?
[162:49.70]Okay, well, at least it's not going to be annoying anymore.
[162:52.96]Alright, we're good to go.
[162:59.18]So, let's just take a moment, just calm down.
[163:04.32]Do I have anything in my inbox?
[163:05.50]No.
[163:06.06]My dream has helped.
[163:08.22]Illegal content, disturbing images, we already saw what it looks like.
[163:13.35]And we're looking for this in pretty much anywhere, but...
[163:18.65]The cool punk Paradise is where we're going to go.
[163:24.72]But I like... We only checked.
[163:27.84]How many sounds did we check here?
[163:29.82]It's like Secrets Uncovered, Stevie Guys, Free Sounds.
[163:33.62]Look at all the stuff we didn't see.
[163:35.90]I got mail.
[163:36.94]What did you do?
[163:49.42]What?
[163:50.82]Excuse me, it never ceases to amaze me how dumb some of you can be.
[163:53.60]I told Dylan that getting random users to do HSPD would be like herding cats and I was right.
[164:00.82]I said not to report professor helpers.
[164:03.76]P.S.
[164:04.02]If it was just a mistake, I apologize.
[164:05.54]Hey, but look at how this is worded.
[164:18.10]What?
[164:19.69]We need to get rid of Kappa Cash, but Professor Helper is okay to stay.
[164:23.69]We are talking to their people to make a deal and get them to break away from their Kappa Cash partnership.
[164:30.08]I'll update you all soon.
[164:31.32]This is a hacked email account.
[164:40.12]Yeah, this is a hacked email.
[164:48.68]Let's go back here.
[164:50.50]People used to type like that back in the day.
[164:57.78]I mean, if you're a CEO of a respected company, come on.
[165:04.03]Clean up your emails.
[165:04.99]Alright, secrets uncovered.
[165:09.55]Do not scroll down my page unless you are ready to read classified info.
[165:13.37]I want to do this.
[165:13.91]I can't just skip everything.
[165:20.52]I hate that song.
[165:22.78]Alright, uncovered secrets.
[165:24.34]Stop.
[165:24.74]Do not scroll down the page unless you are ready to read the universe's biggest secrets.
[165:30.16]There's no going back.
[165:32.36]If you think you are ready to find out for yourself, keep right on scrolling.
[165:38.30]Just a little farther.
[165:40.49]Do you guys remember the people that had the websites where they were never-ending scrollers?
[165:46.10]Where if you held down the scroll button, it would play like a cool animation with text.
[165:52.12]It'd be like A would come up.
[165:53.36]It'd be like A, B. Do we get to see one of those?
[165:59.05]I hope so.
[166:03.53]Do not pass this point unless you know you are 100% ready to see this.
[166:08.64]I hope it's the illegal image.
[166:13.82]What is it gonna be?
[166:24.73]Secrets coming soon!
[166:31.23]If anyone knows how to put pictures from your computer on Hypnospace, let me know.
[166:35.79]I need to put my photos on my site.
[166:46.88]That's funny.
[166:48.56]Nice job, kid.
[166:49.72]Who has a scanner?
[166:50.78]I probably should have caught that.
[166:51.72]What else we got here?
[166:57.45]Free sound effects.
[166:58.37]Cool.
[167:02.37]What just happened?
[167:12.78]No, wait.
[167:14.56]We got trouble.
[167:17.76]How do I not have a virus?
[167:18.70]You saw that.
[167:19.18]See, you guys free sound effects.
[167:25.60]Refresh the page.
[167:29.58]See?
[167:33.00]What's wrong?
[167:38.56]This page cannot be found.
[167:39.64]My computer's gonna break.
[167:43.89]None of these work.
[167:50.95]What are these?
[167:53.31]No, none of them work.
[167:58.27]Net seller.
[167:59.23]Net settler.
[168:01.09]What the hell, Stevie?
[168:07.82]Alright, Tall Green, fact or fiction.
[168:09.32]Everything you thought you knew about Tall Green is wrong.
[168:13.15]Or is it?
[168:17.11]Myth, legend, or fact?
[168:19.85]That's kind of scary.
[168:22.17]Whether you're a skeptic or a believer, you can't deny that there's something people have witnessed, and yes, even video recorded near Lake Rosalie.
[168:30.40]To say they're lying would be to throw out years of evidence, testimony, and true encounters.
[168:35.12]Read on if you are ready.
[168:37.55]Video recorded sighting.
[168:38.68]1989 Louisiana.
[168:40.22]Look very closely.
[168:42.90]Did you catch that?
[168:43.52]Look closer.
[168:44.02]Here, maybe this will help.
[168:49.24]Any questions?
[168:51.98]Didn't think so.
[168:54.53]Didn't think so.
[168:56.01]Just a guy walking.
[169:00.33]You see it?
[169:01.07]Can you see it up here?
[169:01.73]Yeah, actually, that was hard to see for a second.
[169:09.23]That's awesome.
[169:10.05]Anything else here?
[169:10.61]Yeah, I don't want to move on that quickly.
[169:13.67]We're missing all these great websites.
[169:15.53]I seen them.
[169:18.32]Marvin Mechernrys.
[169:23.32]I used to watch those videos.
[169:25.54]Alright, almost done with this place.
[169:28.50]The Truth About Trennis.
[169:31.41]All about the original Trennis that the sports leagues don't want you to know about and the brilliant mind behind it.
[169:39.37]Trennis is a lie.
[169:41.99]Do you know who this man is?
[169:44.86]Of course you don't, but you should.
[169:45.88]This man, Harry Whiskers Stone, is my great, great, great, great, great, great uncle and the real inventor of the game as we know as Trennis.
[169:55.29]The famous Trennis court design that everyone knows is a stolen bastardization of a design Whiskers made way back in the late 1800s.
[170:03.50]A group of investors saw potential in my uncle's brilliant game after watching he and his friends play on a court he made with his own two hands.
[170:13.75]Living a broken heart and empty wallet, read on to learn about the original Trennis.
[170:18.91]The real Trennis.
[170:19.59]This is...
[170:24.38]Trennis wasn't even called Trennis at all, it was called Tennis.
[170:26.80]It was also informally called Stickle for a short time, and rather than being played on a circular court with three participants, it was played on a much more sensible rectangle with two participants.
[170:41.56]What?
[170:43.18]Pictured as a commissioned artist's rendering of the real tennis court.
[170:48.20]Who knows what could have been if the real original game Tennis was allowed to flourish?
[170:52.90]If you'd like to invest in restoring my uncle's brilliant game to its rightful place and culture, please contact me.
[170:58.46]We are currently interviewing industry investors.
[171:01.20]Thank you to Gearhead Greg for helping me to locate the Trennis song and Casper Air Graphics for giving permission to use it.
[171:10.03]There's no, I don't have a place to invest.
[171:16.73]Scam.
[171:18.99]Zarid Celestial Reflection.
[171:24.48]Ooh.
[171:26.18]Fuck.
[171:27.82]Why does it have to be the uninstallation fee for Professor... Helper, whatever his name was.
[171:33.45]The latest record from Zarid, pronounced Zar-eed.
[171:37.75]Oops.
[171:38.81]Award-winning composer and Earth Haze pioneer is now available in stores.
[171:42.61]Nah, this is too bad.
[171:48.66]Six selections from the full album.
[171:51.18]And a Hypno OS background.
[171:55.07]Can't afford it.
[171:58.98]That's the best song in the game?
[172:00.06]That is pretty great.
[172:01.82]Alright, pee break.
[172:03.72]I'm gonna get some more water.
[172:06.19]I need to fill up my glass.
[172:07.99]We'll let the screensaver take over.
[172:09.63]I'll be right back.
[174:58.55]How long does that take to happen?
[175:05.83]Did that just start?
[175:09.89]Why'd you report me?
[175:10.61]I thought we had a deal.
[175:14.69]Like 45 seconds?
[175:16.89]Interesting.
[175:18.31]Now I got another full glass of water.
[175:21.73]Trying to keep my fluids up.
[175:22.91]I've been all fucked up the last couple of days.
[175:26.17]So, sorry for my frequent breaks.
[175:30.36]But we're good.
[175:31.60]Let's go.
[175:35.04]Get this off the screen.
[175:36.16]Alright, we're going to... Where are we going?
[175:40.82]Cool Punk Paradise.
[175:45.41]We're home.
[175:46.43]Our home.
[175:49.43]Oh, that's cool.
[175:50.01]Cool Punk Paradise is the new official sleep time hangout for Cool Punks.
[175:55.77]Now this is a good song.
[176:01.95]Alright, we'll look at very legal content.
[176:03.81]Specifically, images of somebody's asshole.
[176:07.14]Something like that.
[176:10.36]Art by me, don't steal it.
[176:13.08]Snow Joke Collective.
[176:16.00]Why does everybody have jokes?
[176:22.80]It is so chill of Gray's Peak Cola to actually listen to us.
[176:26.42]I am done with cyber worlds.
[176:29.70]If you're not into the culture of Cool Punk, you might be skeptical.
[176:32.44]But to me, the Cool Fest 99 announcement says it all.
[176:35.91]Graze Peak gets it.
[176:38.47]Graze Peak may be a big company, but it is run by people.
[176:41.61]Whoever those people are, they obviously get what Cool Punk is about.
[176:47.18]What is Cool Punk?
[176:49.96]Not only that, but they helped get Freezer signed to Estonic, a respected independent record label.
[176:56.04]They're even setting him up for his own concert and helped him release a single like Cool Punk is on the radio.
[177:01.12]It's a band?
[177:02.30]A group?
[177:06.32]Freezer?
[177:07.99]Verified by Hypnospace community leader.
[177:10.91]I've been chosen as the Cool Punk community leader.
[177:13.09]I can now report problems to the Hypnospace police people.
[177:16.05]If you have any issues, let me know.
[177:24.54]There we go.
[177:30.12]What is Cool Punk?
[177:32.48]What is Cool Punk anyway?
[177:35.19]It all started around Christmas of 1998.
[177:39.29]Jan Wolf was on break from school for the holidays and was very, very bored.
[177:44.77]He found an old acapella tape recording of the Graze Peak Cola theme song.
[177:51.90]As a joke, he decided to mix it into his music.
[177:54.36]Much to his surprise, it sounded very cool.
[177:57.62]In December of 1998, he released a seven-minute song featuring this new cool punk music he invented called Colder Than The Rest.
[178:07.28]It was an underground hit, especially in Hypnospace, where it had the most fans.
[178:12.75]Even though the first release was popular and made cool punk an underground sensation, Freezer was unhappy.
[178:18.45]He felt that the true message of the music was lost.
[178:21.67]So we decided to stop making the songs for a while.
[178:28.06]Okay.
[178:29.72]It's not a bad song.
[178:32.52]The Cool Punk community continued to grow and grow.
[178:34.32]Over 20 Cool Punk albums have been made over the last year.
[178:37.90]Alright.
[178:39.55]And like Lightning Freezer returned, this time he partnered with Mark Ello and Astonic Records to make new music that would reach even bigger audiences.
[178:47.95]So what exactly is Cool Punk?
[178:49.59]That, my friends, for us to know and for you to find out.
[178:51.65]That helps.
[178:58.58]Fan Diary.
[178:59.30]Let's see.
[178:59.64]This is Cool Punk.

[179:08.42]Thank you, Hans.
[179:11.54]Hans Beats.
[179:12.53]Oh, Hans Beats.

[192:55.02]Like, all you can hear is that.
[192:57.50]I'm sitting here trying to do a murder mystery to find the hidden asshole images.

[193:17.91]Turn down this hamburger music.
[193:22.35]What does hamburger music mean?
[193:27.90]Hamburger music.
[193:36.44]Okay, for some reason, I know what you mean.
[193:40.29]Is it weird that I know exactly what you're referencing?

[194:45.34]Alright, anyone know what ever happened to Digix Change?
[194:49.44]I had a bunch of my Freezer and Besita stuff on there, but it just disappeared.
[194:54.03]Digix Change.
[194:56.77]Remember that.
[194:57.23]It's probably hacked.
[195:00.79]Fungus Scene.
[195:01.49]A new movement coming soon.

[195:04.73]Seriously, check back in a few days.

[195:32.25]Also, check out my WITW page by searching WITW.
[195:43.63]Now, there is no music on this page.
[195:46.53]Oh, what a teentopia.
[195:48.45]Look at that.
[195:50.91]Alright, DigiExchange is dead.
[195:52.35]It shouldn't be a surprise that big record labels are contemptuous of real music fans, but it still stings.
[195:59.52]Search FLST for greener pastures.
[196:05.04]Alright, W-I-T-W and FLST.
[196:09.34]Let's go with FLST.
[196:16.96]FLST access portal.

[196:23.32]Enjoy your stay.
[196:25.06]FLST is invite only if you have a password to be able to search for FLST pages.
[196:30.76]Please enter it below.
[196:32.52]There are no easy steps to being invited.
[196:34.26]You must ask someone with a FLST account.
[196:37.16]Do not share your password.
[196:40.12]Click here to access FLST.
[196:43.18]After logging in once, the system will remember you.
[196:44.84]Enjoy the files.
[196:49.03]So you need to be invited.
[196:49.97]So I need to find somebody with a Flisk account and a password.
[197:01.01]Well, let's take a look.
[197:04.50]Access portal.
[197:07.70]Are you sad, sad that DigiExchange closed down and none of your friends are on Flist and you're missing out on all the good tunes?
[197:13.92]Can't figure out how to get a password?
[197:16.22]Well, my friend, today's your lucky day.
[197:17.74]You can use mine for the low price of 99 coins.
[197:22.63]Click the purchase button to buy my Flist password.
[197:24.75]It works.
[197:25.27]Purchase.
[197:26.37]After you pay me and get the password, search Flist and find the access page.
[197:29.31]God damn it.
[197:33.43]Do I have any emails?
[197:34.71]No.
[197:38.42]Shit!
[197:51.63]What about this person?
[197:53.73]Can I get this person's password?
[197:56.91]What in the world?
[197:59.35]A directory of interesting tidbits.
[198:02.55]Chit Chat is a back and forth chat program originally released in 1998.
[198:08.50]FlamingOS, the HypnoOS version, came out in late 98.
[198:12.80]Users are able to add their friends to pals lists and then engage in private or group chats with them.
[198:18.38]Okay.
[198:19.85]HypnoOS communicates often, communities often have large groups to talk about their particular interests, like the popular cybercog and cool punk groups.
[198:30.54]It was also instrumental in helping the music sharing, digi-exchange, and flist groups become organized, right?
[198:40.02]Okay.
[198:40.12]Fuck.
[198:40.26]I can't use chitchat!
[198:41.42]Hold on a minute here, okay.
[199:09.25]No space.
[199:09.65]Sleep time servers.
[199:11.97]Publishing pages and error messages.
[199:19.48]Fuck.
[199:19.84]You sure you can't?
[199:23.62]Nah, I definitely can't install it.
[199:26.50]Enforcers are not allowed to have it.
[199:28.88]You can't send messages through it.
[199:36.60]BTTV is back.
[199:37.60]Good.
[199:39.66]Alright, so these are error codes.
[199:44.52]Your HypnoHeadspace headband hardware has been damaged.
[199:48.19]Application incompatible with OS Enforcer Edition, right?
[199:50.71]I don't think he's meaning anything right now.
[200:01.43]Link to my sandwich encryption info page.
[200:05.53]Which files do you need protected?
[200:08.16]Unofficial sandwich encryption Hypnospace info page.
[200:11.46]What is sandwich encryption?
[200:16.94]Ever see a file that looks like this?
[200:19.78]That's a sandwiched file.
[200:22.22]Sandwich encryption is a file encryption and compression tool made by Sam Parker and Roddy Wall in 1995 for FlamingOS.
[200:32.81]Why sandwich a file?
[200:36.22]I'm gonna put a stamp on this page.
[200:37.30]I feel like I'm gonna need that.
[200:38.48]I need to know what that is.
[200:43.78]Gearhead Greg, okay.
[201:05.20]Read the Dylan email?
[201:07.02]What the hell is it?
[201:14.56]Read the Dylan email.
[201:22.39]Uh, if you got a link to a true tranquility, don't open it.
[201:24.33]It auto-installs a virus.
[201:28.11]The one for the case?
[201:29.29]Oh.
[201:33.83]Looks like a few citizen pages were hacked by that same True Tranquility guy.
[201:39.72]You might want to start by investigating the hacker first.
[201:41.88]Hackers like this are always bragging and posting serial killer-ish cat and mouse games with hints.
[201:47.44]Okay.
[201:51.58]So I'm going to go back to the True Tranquility page.
[201:55.40]I've got this info for later, though.
[202:08.10]Oh, dear.
[202:09.98]Well, choose your parasite.
[202:17.30]Choose a card to see life through the eyes of one of these digital parasites as they encounter true tranquility.
[202:26.29]If you've encountered true tranquility, you are truly blessed.
[202:28.51]Don't fight it.
[202:29.17]Let it guide you.
[202:29.89]Let it open your eyes.
[202:34.06]Dear.
[202:35.04]The rock star.
[202:36.80]The furniture salesman.
[202:39.37]The Lonely Shaman?
[202:42.77]That was Chowder Man!
[202:45.05]The Biker?
[202:45.65]Alright, I'm gonna click Chowder Man.
[202:52.45]Your songs topped the charts in the 1980s.
[202:55.05]You've rocked stages from Los Angeles to New York.
[202:58.28]They loved you, or at least you thought they did, because now, 15 years later, things are different.
[203:03.33]Now you're a punchline.
[203:05.23]Your music is remembered as a fad.
[203:08.13]People can't even recall your name anymore, only how lame and annoying that one of your songs was.
[203:12.86]Uh-oh.
[203:16.74]You take another swig of whiskey and sit down to check your email.
[203:19.52]It contains a link to something called True Tranquility.
[203:23.53]Sounds like another rehab program, no thanks.
[203:27.22]You move your cursor to the delete button, but you stop.
[203:30.04]Something above the subject line draws you in.
[203:32.26]You click the link.
[203:33.22]Alright, hold on.
[203:40.03]Would you like to experience true adoration, true worship?
[203:45.83]Hello, pig.
[203:47.35]I see you.
[203:49.05]This is from T1Mageddon.
[203:53.40]Your computer headband ID, who00928A.
[203:59.17]Oh, 14 Topia.
[204:09.01]Installing.
[204:12.97]This is fucking crazy.
[204:14.03]Alright.
[204:14.61]Do I report this?
[204:16.53]Before you're able to take another breath, tendrils emerge from your monitor.
[204:19.47]Everything turns to black.
[204:20.33]At long last, you've found what you were looking for.
[204:25.49]Choose a different card.
[204:26.27]Special thanks, Tiff.
[204:30.47]True tranquility is not a virus.
[204:38.31]Malicious software?
[204:42.74]Thanks a lot, Tiff.
[204:44.84]Choose another card.
[204:46.38]No, there's no malicious software here.
[204:51.46]That's not an illegal image.
[204:54.70]The salesman.
[205:02.17]No, this is not the virus.
[205:04.85]I see you status, okay.
[205:08.85]The image was that weird blurry one.
[205:17.98]Graphic designs.
[205:18.78]Hello, I'm Ann Lee and I make high quality graphic designs and 3D graphics and make web pages.
[205:23.82]If you need a web page, just let me know.
[205:25.64]This is a 3D model of me.
[205:26.96]I'm a wizard who knows karate.
[205:28.88]So we have to go to these different pages and find the clues?
[205:33.80]He knows what you've been doing.
[205:43.61]You haven't had it easy.
[205:44.33]A car accident left you paralyzed from the waist down at age 22.
[205:48.57]After years of deep depression, you found work as a furniture salesman.
[205:52.01]You've been there for the last 40 years.
[205:54.43]You're good at it, but you suspect it's because your customers feel sorry for you.
[205:59.64]The internet has allowed you to escape to a new reality.
[206:01.56]You can be anyone there.
[206:02.44]You're not Andy on the internet.
[206:04.84]No, no, you're Ann Lee.
[206:06.82]People like Ann Lee there.
[206:08.60]And you like them.
[206:11.05]You spent most of your free time this year on the computer.
[206:14.05]You learned how to design webpages and make all sorts of digital art.
[206:16.97]It's never too late to pick up a new skill.
[206:19.17]Your online friends really seem to enjoy what you make.
[206:21.77]You log into your email.
[206:22.97]There's one new message with a link inside.
[206:24.47]You click it.
[206:40.30]I think I have to go to these people's pages.
[206:42.02]Let me see what happens.
[206:58.74]Is this... a bad image?
[207:00.66]You got trouble.
[207:05.57]No.
[207:07.15]It's not illegal to have, like, a dumb webpage.
[207:10.13]Save the wizard!
[207:15.55]The Rockstar... So this is the... designer's page.
[207:19.70]This is Chowderman.
[207:25.66]This is the... Gargantuan.
[207:27.62]Golden Gargantuan.
[207:29.95]Have we seen the biker?
[207:36.09]Oh, this is that guy, the spiritual guy.
[207:37.95]Okay, your kids hate those weekend trips to the flea market.
[207:44.89]They're sick of sitting in a fold-up chair for six hours while you peddle your dream catchers and crystals and suck a lot of t-shirts.
[207:52.32]It's the only time you're with them, but you have to pay rent somehow.
[207:56.44]You tell people that your divorce was the best thing that ever happened to you.
[207:59.30]It wasn't.
[207:59.72]You're alone.
[208:02.28]You're refreshing your email inbox, waiting anxiously for her next message.
[208:06.23]When you two started talking, it was business.
[208:09.07]She's a psychic and you needed guidance.
[208:11.77]It's something different now.
[208:12.59]There's a deeper connection.
[208:13.49]Your spirits are intertwined.
[208:15.37]You still pay her fees, but you do it because you care for her.
[208:20.05]A new message appears.
[208:20.81]It's not her.
[208:21.41]It's from an unknown sender and contains a link to something called true tranquility.
[208:30.62]Let's see.
[208:32.02]What's it like to be loved?
[208:34.90]Go to Pornhub.
[208:35.88]That doesn't exist.
[208:40.45]You found what you were looking for.
[208:41.71]Alright, so hold on.
[208:44.73]Let me...
[208:47.49]We're gonna follow this little... the trail here.
[208:50.51]So I go to... Hold on.
[208:53.37]Anne Lee.
[209:01.05]No matches for Anne Lee.
[209:08.01]Yeah, what was it?
[209:08.45]T1 Mageddon?
[209:10.39]T1... Mageddon.
[209:15.88]Beyond Twilight.
[209:16.70]T...
[209:21.51]You've reached Tim.
[209:22.53]I am Tim.
[209:25.27]You... Stop.
[209:29.67]You've reached Tim.
[209:30.35]Leave a message.
[209:31.01]God damn it.
[209:33.57]Can I report this person?
[209:36.81]Stop it.
[209:43.23]I thought... That could have been a dick.
[209:45.71]You're right.
[209:46.07]Click the link.
[209:51.58]We've reached him.
[209:52.10]Leave a message.
[209:58.49]I can't get... Whoa, now I got it.
[209:59.71]Okay, there's his other website.
[210:03.61]Hacker dick.
[210:07.27]There's another one.
[210:07.75]Beyond Twilight.
[210:10.86]School sucks.
[210:11.68]They should just stop it at the 8th grade because do any of the kids actually try to learn new things after that?
[210:20.53]Are we asleep or awake?
[210:21.69]How can we really ever know?
[210:23.73]And these mystical tombs are tales I have penned some night since... Who the fuck is this?
[210:30.92]Tiffany Wright.
[210:36.20]And my story is nothing is sure.
[210:37.58]Wait, was that a knock on your door?
[210:40.82]I'm so proud of my friend Tim, who just finished his first interactive scary.
[210:46.42]It's inspired by cybercog and horror films.
[210:49.99]He did the art and music and writing and I tried to help out a little by giving him feedback.
[210:55.80]But seriously, how talented is this dude?
[210:57.32]Read it below.
[211:00.72]Okay.
[211:02.34]Interactive Scary 1 by Tim McGeddon.
[211:04.58]Digital Parasitic Reborn.
[211:08.35]Okay, so this comes to here.
[211:13.29]We've already seen that.
[211:16.31]A scary set on the internet, not Hypnospace.
[211:20.31]in which different kinds of people have sent a mysterious link.
[211:23.50]This is mostly Tim McGeddon's, but I gave feedback mostly to make it less mean.
[211:28.60]Disturbing imagery.
[211:31.65]Come on.
[211:32.75]Where's the disturbing imagery?
[211:37.71]Your beloved wife passed away weeks ago, but the memories of your years together are already fading fast.
[211:42.27]You're not young anymore.
[211:43.29]You sold your motorcycle because you can't see well enough to ride it.
[211:47.19]You no longer desire to have a mark on things and you know you couldn't if you tried and your desire is now rest.
[211:55.08]You've never been fond of computers and learning to use the internet has always been hellish ordeal, but it's worth it.
[212:01.21]The new email notification appears.
[212:02.73]It's from your daughter.
[212:03.53]It contains a link to a website with the only accompanying text reading, Wow, this is so relaxing.
[212:10.10]An odd choice for your daughter who normally communicates via thick, wordy, grammatically pristine paragraphs.
[212:21.36]So we did them all.
[212:31.89]We did them all.
[212:33.41]We're gonna have to go on some kind of hunt here.
[212:37.29]Don't accept it this time?
[212:38.33]Okay, hold on.
[212:38.77]Let's go.
[212:41.35]I do not accept it.
[212:43.79]Error.
[212:44.05]Page not found.
[212:45.41]Error.
[212:45.63]Page not found.
[212:49.50]Home.
[212:50.92]Where is home, really?
[212:52.48]Refresh.
[212:52.80]Refresh the page.
[212:55.16]Stop.
[212:56.48]Ah, this is just a game.
[212:57.28]This button is fake, you dummy.
[212:59.66]Forward?
[213:00.08]Please don't click these fake buttons, stupid.
[213:07.65]Okay.
[213:08.65]So I know who these people are, at least most of them.
[213:11.79]This is Chowderman.
[213:14.03]This is the designer.
[213:19.96]This is the gargantuan Buddha guy.
[213:23.50]Shaman guy.
[213:24.04]I don't know who this is, though.
[213:28.96]Uh-oh.
[213:30.72]Before you're able to take another breath, tendrils... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[213:36.43]Alright, let's go to the Noble Warlock.
[213:39.57]See if anything's going on there.
[213:48.79]Uh... Got it!
[213:52.59]So, now we're gonna go to Chowder, man.
[214:08.89]Chowder Man.
[214:09.47]No results for Chowder Man.
[214:18.19]What?
[214:18.73]Cruncher, right?
[214:25.74]I already got Chowder Man, right?
[214:26.84]Didn't I?
[214:27.32]Yeah, I did.
[214:27.76]Okay.
[214:30.30]So now I gotta go to the Gargantuan.

[215:16.31]Okay.
[215:27.46]I need to get the hacker, don't I?
[215:28.92]Let me just take a look at the case here.
[215:34.29]This cap of cash.
[215:35.31]I need one more.
[215:42.97]Put the music back on?
[215:44.95]Uh, why is this muted?
[215:48.77]Shouldn't be muted.

[215:57.19]Use the search, what, search for like biker?
[215:58.97]I mean, yeah.
[216:07.66]So this case is now closed, but it's not.
[216:13.48]That's too easy to do that way.
[216:14.50]I'm going to find an organic way.
[216:17.78]Burnin' Rubber.
[216:18.44]Born to ride, live ridin' or die tryin'.
[216:23.61]You've reached the Hypnospace page of Carl P. If you are from the class of 50, get a hold of me.
[216:29.15]I'm looking to be reconnected with a Roger Robinson.
[216:31.09]If you know Roger, get a hold of me.
[216:37.76]Please spread this.
[216:38.66]Everyone needs to know.
[216:40.20]Radiation from Hypnospace headband causes beef brain in kids and elderly.
[216:50.49]Roger.
[216:50.95]We're looking for Roger Robinson.
[216:53.17]Let's just find him.
[217:04.74]Tech giants confidence.
[217:08.88]Oh, God.
[217:10.63]Hold on.
[217:12.33]Dylan, what do you want?
[217:15.31]Take some time off and test a new HypnoOS game.
[217:19.91]Hey there, Jerma enforcers, today is your lucky day.
[217:21.95]We're testing out an early version of our new game and you're in on it.
[217:25.39]Note, this stuff is top secret.
[217:27.68]And sharing info or screenshots is very, very prohibited.
[217:32.22]You could face some hairy legal trouble if you leak information.
[217:35.85]With that out of the way, I'd like you to announce a new Hypnospace original game, Outlaw!
[217:40.01]You'll be playing an early offline version, but the final release on schedule for our year 2000 update will be 100% online.
[217:47.35]No need to send us feedback either, the game will automatically report data to me.
[217:50.63]Visit this page to download it and have fun.
[217:55.04]I will resume sending you cases after you test.
[218:02.76]Hi, I made Hypnospace, as in I'm the guy who dreamt it up and programmed it.
[218:06.09]I'm also a game designer, composer, and sound experimentation aficionado.
[218:11.57]Confidential!
[218:13.01]A multiplayer online gaming experience of Hypno OS.
[218:15.97]Out in January.
[218:18.74]We picked you to test the new secret project we're working on called Outlaw.
[218:24.68]Do not share information on this game anywhere.
[218:26.74]This is top secret.
[218:30.56]Just play the game.
[218:31.28]Adjust the controls in the HypnoOS settings menu if you wish.
[218:33.90]Data will be sent back to the developers as you play.
[218:36.44]There's no way to win in this version because this is a test.
[218:38.65]Just play it for three to five minutes.
[218:40.15]Don't share it.
[218:43.61]Temporary art.
[218:44.37]Please remember that this is an early pre-alpha version of Outlaw.
[218:48.75]It is not finished.
[218:53.96]Can you send it to me?
[218:54.80]Yeah, what's your email?
[218:56.78]Don't put your email in this chat.
[218:58.02]Hmm.
[219:05.35]I'm kind of scared to open this.
[219:10.70]We got trouble.
[219:12.08]Early alpha software may cause hypnose to become unstable.
[219:16.18]Are you sure you want to begin testing?
[219:18.54]Not yet.
[219:18.86]Hold on.
[219:25.49]Wait, I need to scan it for viruses.
[219:32.91]We got trouble.
[219:34.53]My boss sent me this program.
[219:47.46]I mean, this case is closed, but there's additional violations I could find.
[219:51.80]Close the case, but I want to do more.
[219:54.47]I want to close the case.
[220:02.45]Close it.
[220:02.73]You're done.
[220:03.07]Close it.
[220:03.43]Close it.
[220:03.99]But what about additional violations?
[220:08.87]There could be more violations.
[220:12.64]Okay.
[220:13.32]No more cases.
[220:13.92]We're all done.
[220:18.82]And the other case.
[220:22.08]These are all closed.
[220:22.70]What are we talking about?
[220:26.37]I closed these all already.
[220:30.43]Alright, I'm going to play it.
[220:32.79]Because I'm here.
[220:37.00]The other one?
[220:45.52]Press any key to start.
[220:51.40]What do I do?
[220:51.90]Loading in connected hyper citizen.
[220:53.46]Jerma connected to outlaw.
[220:54.58]All connected citizens loaded to fall.
[220:56.50]Outlaw slush mouth is on the loose.
[220:59.88]How do I play?
[221:03.09]Oh, okay.
[221:08.05]This game sucks.
[221:10.21]How do I get the... Am I getting points?
[221:12.83]What do I have to do?
[221:15.75]I'm losing money.
[221:19.95]Anti-government page.
[221:20.85]Germans found the outlaw.
[221:22.01]Give chase.
[221:23.15]Where?
[221:23.43]I don't think I can do anything.
[221:29.56]I think the game's just broken.
[221:34.40]Hardware damage.
[221:35.98]Contact merchant software repair or replacement.
[221:38.00]I just got damaged.
[221:42.64]Bios settings.
[221:43.76]Oh, what?
[221:49.56]Did I die?
[221:53.86]Why do I have $53?
[222:01.12]Three weeks later.
[222:05.44]Interesting.
[222:05.96]I think I might have died.
[222:15.64]Important message received from dispatch.
[222:18.81]Important message received from dispatch.
[222:21.45]Oh, God.
[222:21.99]Important message received from dispatch.
[222:24.07]Hold on.
[222:24.23]We have some... Important message received from Dylan.
[222:28.13]Alright, flag.
[222:30.53]It's been 21 days since you last logged on.
[222:33.59]I got the beef brain.
[222:34.85]Where have you been?
[222:35.54]Alright, let's see.
[222:38.48]Security team has freed your flag.
[222:41.12]Zane, ROX-14 will receive a warning.
[222:43.18]Thank you for remaining vigilant.
[222:45.21]important message received from dispatch hold on looks like he was just playing around sent a warning if he does it again we may ban that brassy kid will receive three day detainment thank you for remaining vigilant so cory was a real bad egg here
[223:08.42]The decapitation was a little extreme.
[223:10.79]Keep an eye on this one.
[223:11.97]Seems like a loner type.
[223:13.97]Detainment is just a word meaning that users can't post for a while and their page becomes unlisted.
[223:19.01]We aren't actually detaining people.
[223:21.97]Oh.
[223:23.27]Okay.
[223:25.79]Sherry Heals will receive three-day detainment
[223:30.88]Psychics are weird.
[223:31.88]If she does it again, flag and we'll ban her.
[223:34.90]Detainment's just a word meaning that users can't post.
[223:37.06]Doesn't mean we actually are detaining them.
[223:38.46]Alright.
[223:38.70]Sorry about frying your headbands.
[223:41.56]Hi, Enforcers.
[223:42.18]It's nice to have you back.
[223:43.54]I'd like to apologize on behalf of our shipping department interns that we couldn't get those repaired headbands to you sooner.
[223:49.80]Thankfully, most of the components were unharmed, so all of your settings should be preserved.
[223:54.54]Might have another outlaw test for you later, this time one that won't destroy your hardware.
[224:00.83]Okay.
[224:00.93]Mass cleanup.
[224:26.56]Hello enforcers, Samantha here.
[224:28.51]Dylan asked me to do the HSPD stuff for today because only two enforcers have been working headbands.
[224:34.95]Over the last two weeks, Hypnospace is a complete mess.
[224:38.53]Oh, God.
[224:40.33]We need you to go out there and clean up anything you can find.
[224:42.58]We won't be sending cases or reports in advance because we're completely swamped.
[224:47.26]If you find multiple infractions of a certain type, I'll create a case for it, but only after you report the violations.
[224:55.44]I will be assigning each of you cases individually after we clean up, but sifting through the individual reports from the last two weeks is going to take me some time.
[225:06.21]This has been a message for all enforcers from Ms.
[225:09.13]Samantha.
[225:13.61]Okay.
[225:15.47]I know you have a lot of bugs to squash, but it's chaos out there.
[225:19.74]Just send the enforcers out to hammer violations without making cases first.
[225:23.78]Thanks, m'lady.
[225:26.82]okay no cases here it's just a mess how much of a mess we will find out okay let's check out uh let's check out good time valley how's good time valley doing look of a violation stand with goober
[225:50.18]If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter, said Abraham Lincoln.
[225:59.07]This is not about a cartoon, it's about resisting the erasure of the work of a patriotic hero, a man who was willing to sacrifice everything for his country, W.E.
[226:07.53]Briggs.
[226:09.15]We honor his memory and we honor America by standing with Gooper.
[226:13.80]Add this badge to your page to stand in agreement.
[226:17.56]Go ahead, enforcers, do your worst.
[226:27.03]Yep, shut it down.
[226:28.67]There's a little gooper here.
[226:38.41]Alright, what about the stand with gooper?
[226:41.51]How many pages do we have here?
[226:43.13]Oh, Jesus.
[226:45.38]rr ranch I stand with gooper a blatant attack on free speech and American values has been carried out by the elites at Merchantsoft and their mob cronies the hspd add this club best to your page to let Merchantsoft know you are not putting up with it
[227:10.70]it's the teacher disclaimer not me I just like this photo oh my god I'm I did I just did one thing case added gumshoe gooper content this whole zone has been a problem for the last two weeks but none of us want to ban anyone over a silly goldfish cartoon hopefully they retreat soon added a new gumshoe gooper case so you can cash in on today's violations
[227:39.44]Alright.
[227:39.88]I already got two of them.
[227:46.02]Uh, let me see if there's any more.
[227:51.85]I stand with Gooper.
[227:55.57]Abby's World.
[227:59.15]I stand with... Does that count?
[228:02.49]Close the case.
[228:03.27]Don't be evil.
[228:05.99]I need the money.
[228:06.65]Okay.
[228:12.85]I blew all of my money giving it to some random person.
[228:15.23]Alright.
[228:18.05]I don't think that counts as an image.
[228:23.03]The dumpster.
[228:23.69]The dumpster needs to be shut down.
[228:24.83]I don't know why Hypnose Bates tolerates them insulting everyone who just comes on here to drive a good time.
[228:29.64]And no, it being unlisted is not an excuse.
[228:32.18]A little kid could type that in the search bar and see all that horrible, horrible trash.
[228:40.42]Alright, who else has the Gooper image?
[228:41.83]Right here, Warlock.
[228:46.89]Noble Warlock supports the Stand with Gooper movement.
[228:48.87]My brother is a lawyer and he said that there is no reason these people can't show pictures of the Gooper cartoon.
[228:53.71]So stop picking on my friends.
[228:57.51]Hold on.
[229:13.18]Is the badge?
[229:13.68]Let me try the badge.
[229:22.89]Nice, okay.
[229:28.11]Page by page.
[229:33.27]It really is easy money.
[229:34.14]You can call me a terrible person all you want.
[229:36.06]It's like 15 bucks every time.
[229:38.88]Let's see, 8.
[229:39.74]It's like 11 dollars every time.
[229:43.02]Worth it.
[229:50.06]Barkley atoms are the only bites, okay.
[229:52.36]Oh, you got a lot!
[229:53.26]Wow, I'm gonna flag you too.
[229:59.32]You are fucked.
[230:01.36]You went overboard with this one.
[230:02.68]You got trouble.
[230:10.43]I stand with Goober!
[230:11.87]It's only like five people.
[230:14.91]No one's gonna use this service?
[230:26.05]I guess they won't.
[230:33.86]Look at how much money I made out of this, though.
[230:37.14]You've reached the page of Carl P. Yeah, okay.
[230:43.65]Who else was standing with Gooper?
[230:47.89]You were.
[230:48.51]And there's yours.
[230:49.37]Okay.
[230:50.99]I think that's it, right?
[231:09.26]flag them should I flag them all you got trouble no they told they even no no I'm not gonna do that they even told me this is just a harmless dumb thing if they keep at it ban them I was told in the email that this was harmless let's close that case look at all these extra ones
[231:38.65]Alright, we got some just- Good job out there, Jerma, but there's more to clean up.
[231:48.36]I'm arranging a few normal cases for you right now, but in the meantime, see if you can find a few more violations on your own.
[231:54.72]Easy.
[231:54.92]We're looking for violations.
[231:59.45]Let's go to the homepage.
[232:02.13]Alright.
[232:03.56]Let's go back to Good Time Valley.
[232:04.74]I feel like there's a lot of, uh... Granny's Cream.
[232:08.72]Granny Cream's Hot Butter Ice Cream.
[232:10.40]Tasty and healthy, too.
[232:11.26]We call it Heat and Sip.
[232:12.50]Ugh.
[232:15.91]That's defred.
[232:17.31]The winner of this year's Granny's Stash Confit... Ugh!
[232:19.73]That's fucking disgusting.
[232:33.86]Children being served hot butter ice cream.
[232:37.50]The real Granny Cream made her first batch of delicious hot butter ice cream all the way back in 1937.
[232:44.51]After serving generous batches to the less fortunate kids in her neighborhood, Lucille's husband encouraged her to package and sell her creation.
[232:53.08]initially employed local butter boys to serve her hot butter ice cream at sports games her delicious hot butter ice cream achieved global fame after green devil pitcher philbert smith that's chowder man again chowder man you are everywhere the world series would download chowder man's creative rap take on the classic granny cream jingle downloading granny cream
[233:19.92]Official Hypnospace partner brand.
[233:21.76]Alright, there's nothing else here.
[233:27.96]Can I flag a website for being... Is this just disgusting and pornographic in nature?
[233:35.36]That's fucked up.
[233:38.96]Uh, Hypnospace heaven.
[233:43.02]It's like being attacked by snobby 20-year-olds sitting in a cushy office building somewhere.
[233:46.70]Get a life.
[233:48.81]Welcome to heaven.
[233:54.01]This is a page for sacred space where the members of those who have passed on may live.
[233:59.27]Namaste.
[233:59.79]To Bill Bowerson, you're the best friend and husband God gave me.
[234:06.11]To Sue, my beanie girl.
[234:09.13]You shined so brightly wherever you went to and everyone could see.
[234:11.98]These people that died?
[234:22.13]Lisa, I wish you were still here with me.
[234:23.73]They took my bike license.
[234:25.17]I can't see no more.
[234:26.52]So don't worry about me.
[234:27.34]I won't be getting into no accidents.
[234:29.08]I wish we could have ridden together one last time.
[234:31.06]Can't wait to see you.
[234:32.08]He's the biker.
[234:40.54]That's... That's Gooper!
[234:42.48]That's Gooper!
[234:44.58]You're in trouble!
[234:49.23]We got trouble.
[234:51.17]Everybody uses the gooper image.
[234:53.40]Is there any other cartoon characters?
[234:55.16]Wait, make sure I get it.
[234:57.20]We got trouble.
[234:57.72]What else we got?
[234:58.22]Oh damn.
[235:10.35]She has helped so many with her love and support.
[235:12.55]Now the time for action.
[235:13.71]We need a leader with the courage to stand against the attack on her faith and values.
[235:18.21]And Southern Gent RR is that person.
[235:20.67]Southern Gent RR.
[235:21.63]I can't even read this.
[235:24.23]Endorsed by Gumshoe Gooper himself.
[235:26.49]Here he is walking at Reginald's future inauguration parade.
[235:33.02]You stand with Gooper too, don't you?
[235:39.40]You got trouble.
[235:41.52]You got trouble.
[235:51.70]Okay, anything else here?
[235:52.70]25 violations.
[235:58.89]I mean, come on.
[236:02.07]Abby writes, you've got way too many.
[236:06.83]You got trouble.
[236:15.50]What do you mean, wow, dude?
[236:19.64]Did you have 25 violations?
[236:23.76]A lot of these people have, like, two, three, nine.
[236:31.50]Okay, we're looking for stuff besides Gooper.
[236:39.13]Scotty's page.
[236:42.30]If you got Gooper, I swear to God.
[236:44.30]Please stop putting the Gumshoe Gooper cartoon on your pages.
[236:46.82]Thanks, Scotty.
[236:47.54]Hi, I'm Mr. Old Fashioned.
[236:51.53]I'm happy to be the community leader for Good Time Valley, even though I don't know why they picked me.
[236:55.63]I think it's because I have good behavior, but that's because I don't ever use Hypnospace other than for listening to songs.
[237:00.83]Haha.
[237:03.87]If you are having trouble, you can contact me, but I am sometimes busy, and I'm also not on Hypnospace every night.
[237:09.40]Well, bye.
[237:13.15]Okay.
[237:18.27]Good citizen.
[237:20.87]This is Mavis's page.
[237:22.21]I've updated my page.
[237:23.29]Welcome.
[237:26.53]This is so ugly.
[237:27.47]The citizen's free trial is ended.
[237:28.89]This page will be deleted in 30 days unless their subscriber option is renewed.
[237:44.24]Oh, I can't even... I can't even still look.
[237:51.86]I can't look at that.
[237:56.16]Pete's love poems.
[237:57.12]Here are my poems.
[237:57.81]Let's see, Pete.
[237:58.75]Everybody has these free trials.
[238:04.57]I can't even read this.
[238:11.54]I'll miss you all.
[238:12.66]Thanks for hearing my poems.
[238:14.32]Maybe I will get another free trial.
[238:20.04]Probably not.
[238:23.48]This guy got beef brained?
[238:24.50]Yeah.
[238:33.15]Reginald for leader.
[238:34.39]Look here if you support Reginald and want her to be a community leader.
[238:37.25]We saw this already.
[238:40.09]Looking for other violations.
[238:43.36]Sandy's empty nest.
[238:45.64]My kids are grown and I'm just enjoying life to its fullest with my husband.
[238:50.12]Oh, this is Sandy.
[238:50.84]Okay.
[238:52.04]Sandy Gumshoe Gooper's statement.
[238:55.03]Why are they all obsessed with the Gooper thing?
[239:03.62]Hello, my loves.
[239:04.36]Please don't take this as me being against you all.
[239:06.72]But I think we should not be putting the Gumshoe Gooper cartoons on our page.
[239:10.70]If W.E.
[239:11.30]Briggs Estate doesn't want us to, it doesn't seem like Merchantsoft are lying about this one.
[239:16.94]Beefbrain is a hoax.
[239:19.35]Click here to go to my humor picture gallery.
[239:24.91]Yeah, we already saw these.
[239:27.29]Gumshoe Gooper was on here.
[239:28.41]Not anymore.
[239:35.73]Thief brain is a hoax.
[239:37.94]Stop falling for these obvious tricks.
[239:41.14]Hello friends, I understand that some of you are concerned that Hypnospace can hurt your brain.
[239:45.74]And who knows, maybe it can.
[239:47.42]But I have to say that this beef brain thing is very suspicious.
[239:50.76]If you look at the bottom of the beef brain main page, it says something about minks, if I remember right.
[239:57.20]These are the same hooligans who pulled the explosive headband prank and then half of you put that horrible, horrible song on your page in order to prevent your head from blowing up.
[240:08.22]If the Hypnospace headband is unhealthy, it's probably just because it makes you tired and not some crazy brain disease.
[240:16.89]Love, Sandy.
[240:23.53]Okay, Sandy.
[240:26.41]The dumpster!
[240:28.82]The dumpster page should be shut down.
[240:30.30]I don't know how they get away with tearing people down all the time.
[240:33.34]Arlen, your artwork is awesome.
[240:34.76]Don't listen to these spoiled punks who wouldn't know good art if it bit them in the behind.
[240:39.86]If they were any good, they wouldn't hide their page like slimy cowards.
[240:53.61]We're going.
[240:59.61]The dumpster.
[241:03.63]Taking out Hypnospace is trash so you don't have to.
[241:06.04]Enter.
[241:12.95]Previous dumpings.
[241:15.49]I went to CoolFest99.
[241:17.13]This event was incredible.
[241:18.22]CoolPunk is finally dead, folks, and CoolFest killed it.
[241:22.68]From the moment I stepped out of my car onto the ironically scorching pavement of the King Amphitheater parking lot, I knew this was going to be special.
[241:31.47]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[241:32.97]Thanks to the five community subs.
[241:37.31]Again, your username is going to be pretty irrelevant in like a week.
[241:44.68]when I play Minecraft VR.
[241:47.20]But thank you so much for your five subs.
[241:50.74]Okay, hold on.
[241:53.47]Sandwiched between two enormous ads for extra thick chips was the CoolFest ticket window.
[241:58.53]Waiting patiently in front of worth 200 people, not quite the 5,000 person turnout the CoolFest planters were hoping for.
[242:04.51]Here's a highly scientific pie chart of the attendee types.
[242:09.10]Confused 45-year-old chowder man fans, 15-year-old cool punk kids, and parents of 15-year-old cool punk kids.
[242:20.30]Is this a fire festival jab here?
[242:25.15]After grabbing our tickets, a venue attendant had us from another line at the opposite end of the venue for our promised Joe Man merch.
[242:32.25]Only the cool punk kids and parents hit this line, with the chowder man people heading inside to get good seats for his opening act.
[242:39.56]After waiting for nearly an hour for the merch to show up, the sound of tires screeching called our attention to a truck speeding towards us.
[242:47.95]Knocking a few trash cans over on the way, some sweaty guy emerged with a single box of Joe Man keychains.
[242:55.01]No shirts, and no Freak Ray's Peek Cola, as promised.
[242:59.90]People were pissed, and the keychains were used as projectiles throughout the rest of the evening.
[243:09.56]Chowder Man had already launched into the Chowder Man's hotel room.
[243:13.30]Let's get some... What did I download?
[243:18.70]There we go.
[243:19.06]No.
[243:19.34]Where's Chowder Man?
[243:48.63]There we go.
[243:50.27]Found it to be appropriate.
[243:52.83]Chowder Man had already launched into the Chowder Man's hotel room when me and the gaggle of cool punk kids and parents arrived at the stage.
[243:59.45]He followed it up with some eight-minute song about shaving, a couple of newer rap rock songs with his new band Cruncher, and an encore of an extended version of the Gray's Peak jingle.
[244:10.42]No one really cared or seemed particularly into the stuff until the Gray's Peak thing that had happened.
[244:16.22]A helicopter landed on a platform in the middle of the crowd, and the band, eight, and a few, the band and a few fans from backstage hopped aboard.
[244:29.28]I was surprised that the thing even made it safely with all the wires hanging around.
[244:33.71]As I'm sure you all know, Chowderman crashed his copter.
[244:36.73]Old Chowder's leg had to be amputated and their drummer died.
[244:41.39]I can't bring myself to be awful about this because it was harrowing to watch.
[244:46.78]You'd think they'd call it a night after a helicopter crash, but no, Cool Fest continued.
[244:52.20]An old guy from Gray's Peak, a guy in a Joeman costume and a few Merchantsoft people came up and gave a speech about how amazing and dedicated Cool Punk fans are and threw a few shirts into the crowd.
[245:03.39]It would have been weird anyway, but the crash just made it completely surreal to watch.
[245:09.47]Freezer hit the stage next and played for only 15 minutes before it became clear that he was lip-syncing.
[245:16.24]the Cool Punk kids started yelling mild swear words and started throwing their Joe Man keychains on stage.
[245:22.89]An old guy came out and told everyone that Cool Fest was over, and that was it.
[245:27.73]Needless to say, the event exceeded my expectations.
[245:44.67]That was very well written, too.
[245:48.55]That's a very good comedy write-up right there.
[245:54.26]Alright, so... The dumpster.
[245:57.88]I went to Cool Fest.
[245:58.66]There it is.
[246:00.08]Too popular now?
[246:03.88]Ooh!
[246:03.98]Like, do these people get that it's private?
[246:05.40]Here are a bunch of interesting poems.
[246:06.54]This is a password.
[246:07.10]These are passwords.
[246:32.49]Drawings of cars with human heads.
[246:35.21]Even Chowderman himself is using it, and well, just see for yourself.
[246:40.06]Is this a password?
[246:40.80]We should probably revoke all Flist passwords and start again.
[246:48.74]At least they don't know about the Net Settler Safe Mode thing yet.
[246:52.84]Nobody tell them, please.
[246:57.56]Safe mode, NetSettler safe mode.
[247:00.28]Do I have NetSettler?
[247:01.84]What is this?
[247:02.28]No, that's HypnoCure.
[247:03.20]Alright, so F00088D.
[247:09.60]Somebody write that down.
[247:17.88]Everybody write these down.
[247:23.45]The free lands are amazing.
[247:27.94]Taking out Hypnospace is trash, okay.
[247:31.38]This group of geeks staged an insurrection after Merchantsoft deleted their favorite zones and I legitimately like what they've done.
[247:38.86]It's dumb as hell, but I love it.
[247:41.10]Instead of a list of pages, you have to navigate their zone by clicking arrows on a giant multi-page map and click on landmarks to visit their pages.
[247:51.87]It takes ages to find what you're looking for.
[247:54.21]I have sticky notes.
[247:55.87]Maybe you guys already wrote them down.
[247:59.57]Look, the only thing I have... My only sticky note is from the first 10 minutes of the game.
[248:04.80]Alright, what are they?
[248:07.88]You guys are going to fuck with me here, so I'm just going to get it myself.
[248:14.58]Alright, F1.
[248:16.88]F10427A.
[248:16.98]F10427A.
[248:26.56]F10427A... F15997A?
[248:27.04]Fuck!
[248:27.20]No!
[248:27.34]F15... What was it?
[248:28.40]Oh, goddammit.
[248:28.84]Control-Alt-Delete.
[248:31.94]F... F10427A... F10427A... F15997A...
[248:55.63]F15997A.
[248:55.75]And F000888D.
[248:56.49]F000888D.
[248:56.69]Got it.
[248:57.13]Cool.
[248:57.31]Copy and paste?
[249:01.37]I can't, see?
[249:02.05]No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[249:08.19]Stop talking.
[249:13.22]Stop talking.
[249:24.30]People were only using it to post rips of the bad obscure music.
[249:27.73]They was gonna wait till he's done But now the Hypnospace rabble are sharing passwords, I guess and it's getting really really here's a Twitch TTS donation to these people Okay Complaining about zones
[249:46.51]that a Merchantsoft employee is partially responsible for its existence.
[249:49.98]He disabled the page owner field on the freelance page.
[249:53.20]So technically anyone who knows about it can get in and make changes.
[249:58.30]Really?
[250:01.76]He just disabled the page owner field.
[250:06.62]I did a little tinkering yet added a dong shape, but my edits were changed back minutes later.
[250:11.00]So there must be some nerd out there keeping a really close eye on this stuff.
[250:18.53]Oh, he put a dick on it.
[250:19.81]Okay, I get it.
[250:20.19]Alright, so the homepage can be edited.
[250:26.01]And then visit the archive.
[250:26.99]1999.
[250:29.71]Halloween in Hypnospace.
[250:32.38]World's worst HSM shutdown.
[250:38.00]Designed by non-musicians to save bandwidth by triggering samples that come pre-installed with Hypno OS.
[250:46.32]HSMs can only be made using Hypnospace tune sequencer a free software package for FlamingOS The accessibility of the software has resulted in a plague of unlistenable trash music from amateur composers the world over Please put your ears together for the world's worst HSM showdown.

[252:05.38]I actually like this one
[252:10.24]No, not Chowder Man.
[252:11.20]I'm going to keep this one on.
[252:19.34]He says these songs suck.
[252:21.32]Let's go back to the archive.
[252:24.28]Halloween in Hypnospace.
[252:27.86]Nothing illegal here.
[252:30.85]Nothing.
[252:33.13]Just keep this song on all night.

[253:09.36]Let's have a look at the fellow on the right.
[253:11.56]I guess on the left, what?
[253:14.00]Why do I exist?
[253:14.90]Oh, chowder man, please.
[253:35.17]We consider that admirable if he wasn't also inflicting irreversible psychological trauma in the process.
[253:42.19]Arlen found our article.
[253:43.78]Ow.
[253:44.18]Had a personal meltdown and removed his Halloween page.
[253:47.54]Don't take these things so hard, Arlen.
[253:49.22]We're just pulling your hairy Celtic leg.
[254:00.21]Arlen's Halloween.
[254:01.07]I need this.
[254:06.59]That's the dumpster.
[254:11.01]Uh, these are the dumpies.
[254:16.61]And the award for most heinous abuse of a Hypnospace template goes to yourbotreggie55 of the cafe.
[254:23.68]His website sucks.
[254:27.32]The bubblegum template.
[254:32.31]Reggie, level with us, man.
[254:33.39]What were you thinking here?
[254:34.21]At least bump that placeholder graphic down a few pixels so your three visitors can actually read about your wife.
[254:42.66]That's pretty good.
[254:45.66]The Chaos Award goes to Zane.
[254:48.49]Zane rocks 14.
[254:51.20]Zane is only 15 years old, but we've made an exception to our usual over-18 rule because his page got game or way lame as an exceptionally juvenile, cruel, testosterone-fueled work of art.
[255:01.76]Click the pic to visit.
[255:02.58]We already shut him down.
[255:03.40]Okay, yeah, the dumpies.
[255:06.74]Page of the year goes to Gray's Peak Coca-Cola.
[255:12.46]They're unironically thrilled about Gray Peak's horrible tasting drink coming back.
[255:17.54]The three weed-smoking 19-year-olds who actually believed this was a meaningful anti-capitalist art movement have got to be pissed right now.
[255:33.50]Go check their pages?
[255:34.56]Let's go check up on them.
[255:39.30]You still seeing the people a little lame?
[255:41.58]Episode 2 deleted.
[255:45.32]The news is true.
[255:45.90]I dumped my girlfriend.
[255:46.68]It just did not work out.
[255:48.22]Also, I don't like squishers anymore.
[255:50.26]It's for kids.
[255:51.08]I like gory movies a lot.
[255:52.45]New comic up.
[255:54.13]My best one yet.
[255:54.87]I gotta go back to his, uh... Where's his webpage?
[256:11.51]To the main Got Game or Way Lame selection page.
[256:13.81]How do I get to his website?
[256:19.49]Zane?
[256:19.91]I guess I can just type it in.
[256:22.90]Zane!
[256:26.56]I'm not gonna report this kid again.
[256:31.52]Okay, new updates.
[256:36.03]I used to run a cool, hilarious page here, but it got shut down because Hypnospace couldn't handle the jokes.
[256:41.83]Too sensitive like seven-year-olds.
[256:43.45]Alright, Big Z Studio Slayers, episode two.
[256:51.11]Jessica's no longer my girlfriend.
[256:52.52]Alright, let's see, this is episode two.
[256:54.42]Alright, let's turn this, let's mute this so we can get the full experience.
[257:04.32]Okay.
[257:06.50]Hey, numbnuts, over here.
[257:09.80]Don't scream.
[257:10.38]Yes, I am powerful, but I am a good guy.
[257:12.28]Come outside, Zane, now.
[257:15.24]Voila.
[257:16.18]I am Mikey Psyche.
[257:17.38]We have been watching you, Zane.
[257:18.72]Come into my energy portal.
[257:20.26]Only if you can handle it.
[257:21.52]Let's go.
[257:23.18]A few minutes later.
[257:26.00]They go into the portal.
[257:28.70]Practice stage, training zone, elite training only, game zone.
[257:35.63]This place is freaking huge.
[257:37.79]Yes, it's the biggest secret base in the galaxy.

[257:55.41]Those dreams you had...
[257:57.59]They're all real.
[257:58.35]The demons, the green energy, your secret powers, and double pistols, all of it's real.
[258:01.73]We need your help, Zane.
[258:03.75]There is an evil force at stake in this world.
[258:06.23]Most people are blind to its power.
[258:08.65]But we have been fighting it for 20 years.
[258:11.37]For some reason, Zane, it is scared of you.
[258:14.35]It knows you have a secret power, and if you train and unlock the power, it knows that you can kill it.
[258:26.18]sorry I didn't unmute the music catch up and read issue one not your daddy's comics alright saying good work alright we were back here what was I doing oh we were in the dumpster I'm still looking for a random illegal got any emails

[259:01.09]Let's go back.
[259:05.61]The cafe.
[259:11.50]I'm gonna say we should go to Teentopia.
[259:18.82]Oh, check the password.
[259:19.60]It's a good idea.
[259:24.81]There's a lot of pages I have not been to.
[259:26.33]Jennifer's page, here we go.
[259:30.07]I got broken up with!
[259:31.59]Unfortunately, I have some very bad news.
[259:33.49]Corey Paul has dumped me.
[259:36.39]He says he has met someone else who is very special on here, so I totally get it.
[259:40.36]I wish we could be together forever, but alas, it was not to be.
[259:42.96]Farewell, Corey Paul.
[259:46.02]Reading, writing, graphic design, athletic teams at school, doing hair and makeup girl stuff.
[259:53.35]Oh no, me and Cory are no longer together as a couple.
[259:55.39]She took that very well, yeah?
[260:01.83]She took it way, very well.
[260:04.98]It was not meant to be, goodbye.
[260:08.34]What was going on with this web?
[260:09.36]Wait, wait, wait, did you hear that?
[260:22.44]Did Zane... What's going on here?
[260:25.76]He's still handsome and smart, but don't like him anymore.
[260:28.64]I've broken up with Zane.
[260:30.30]We just broke up tonight.
[260:31.10]He's awesome and his comics are incredible.
[260:33.73]Just didn't work out.
[260:34.47]It's because I'm too scared at horror movies and he likes to watch those all the time.
[260:40.65]Yeah, he's making these websites.
[260:44.85]Zane is making multiple websites.
[260:46.22]Pretending.
[260:46.52]Pretending.
[260:51.43]Alright, here's Pizza Boogie.
[260:54.07]Downloading the Dr. Pizza Pizza Dance song.
[260:56.03]It's free.
[260:56.69]I already have it.
[260:58.49]You guys remember Hamster Dance?
[261:09.09]Does that still exist?
[261:16.53]That website still launches.
[261:22.79]You did it on Beat Saber.
[261:24.09]No, no, no, that was the Crazy Frog song.
[261:30.78]The one that goes... Ah, that hurt.
[261:39.76]I can't do it.
[261:46.54]Mention the pizza dance song on your next Dr. Pizza visit to get a free ice cream treat.
[261:53.35]Offer valid until 1-31-2000.
[261:55.65]One ice cream sundae per child, $1100 per visit.
[261:58.79]Dr. Pizza.
[262:02.31]That's question number three.
[262:03.25]Never do that again.
[262:08.90]Why would I ever do that again?
[262:11.18]Can you come up with a reason why I would ever try to do the hamster dance song again?
[262:15.48]This is the only context where it makes any sense.
[262:17.22]A 1990s internet simulator.
[262:22.64]Why did I do it once?
[262:23.50]Because we're in a 1990s Internet Simulator and I had to show you guys!
[262:30.61]Okay, we got the, uh... Squisher.
[262:32.89]I'm still looking for violations.
[262:38.89]Randy's Dino World.
[262:39.97]Okay, Happy Thanksgiving, Randy's Dino World, and more!

[262:54.25]I'm asking for a dinosaur that really walks.
[262:57.37]Triceratops, T-Rex.
[262:59.80]Oh, that one doesn't work.
[263:01.42]Stegosaurus.
[263:02.98]Broken.
[263:03.98]Triceratops, broken.
[263:05.40]Pterodactyl, broken.
[263:07.24]Spinosaurus, broken.
[263:08.36]And many more, broken.
[263:12.54]Take this website down.
[263:16.32]Randy's other page.
[263:17.28]See, listen.
[263:23.04]Why is it doing that?
[263:23.80]Why is it slowing down like that?
[263:29.18]This is about me.
[263:29.96]I am on Hypnospace every night.
[263:31.54]I am so sleepy so I go to bed early so I can go on Hypnospace more and more.
[263:35.56]I love Hypnospace.
[263:36.60]My birthday is January 10th.
[263:37.90]I like drawing ice cream and dinosaurs.
[263:41.48]I like Mr. Peters.
[263:42.72]He's so funny.
[263:44.26]I like Taurus X. I love Squishersy.
[263:46.54]I love my mom and dad.
[263:48.08]And little sister.
[263:51.45]It's Pizza Dance.
[263:54.56]What is Taurus X?
[264:07.09]No, nothing.
[264:07.65]What?
[264:11.19]No, I'm not going to ban the little kid.
[264:13.99]He's not breaking any laws.
[264:15.15]He's not... Look.
[264:15.61]There's nothing here.
[264:24.30]We still have Timageddon.
[264:25.20]We still have this fucked up website.
[264:31.66]No violations here.
[264:32.42]I'm going to try those passports.
[264:41.02]What was the name of that thing?
[264:48.44]What the hell was that website?
[264:51.30]FLST, right?
[264:54.82]Access portal.
[264:56.18]Password's here.
[264:58.84]Oh, the price went up to 200 bucks?
[265:05.09]Wasn't this 99?
[265:05.89]This was so much cheaper before.
[265:10.43]Oh, fuck off.
[265:16.07]Okay, let's try it.
[265:16.73]F10427A.
[265:26.03]F10427A.
[265:26.13]Does not match any.

[265:30.30]F00088D.
[265:30.50]What the fuck?
[265:31.00]Those aren't passwords.
[265:58.48]You need to tilde.
[265:59.54]Tilde.
[266:05.15]Tilde at the beginning.
[266:05.99]I can't do tilde.
[266:06.73]It doesn't do anything.
[266:11.55]Tilde doesn't do anything.
[266:12.53]Those are error codes.
[266:17.13]Do I actually have to buy it?
[266:25.20]Check the scam, see if the sub boy updated with treasure.
[266:32.49]There is nothing there.
[266:34.47]I got scammed.
[266:38.29]What if I just search for password?
[266:40.47]Is it that broken?
[266:42.81]Is this internet that bad?
[266:44.63]Password.

[291:23.29]There has to be.
[291:23.95]I think you guys are right.

[292:35.09]This is so much money.
[292:36.43]You know how hard it was doing my job?
[292:38.33]It was less money than this.
[292:45.22]Don't you guys realize that?
[292:46.60]Working was giving me less money than dragging files.
[292:59.26]800.
[292:59.30]How do I get to level... How do I get higher up?
[293:11.27]Is there only three levels?

[294:10.93]What happened?
[294:11.47]What's going on?
[294:12.31]What happened?
[294:14.49]What happened?

[294:43.74]I don't understand.
[294:44.80]If you leave it amidst a virus?
[294:48.84]It looked like it just sat over here for a second and then disappeared.
[294:52.36]I didn't know they were time-sensitive.
[294:56.26]The virus wiggles, so... It's alright, we're almost done.
[295:11.43]Alright, would you rather me play this for another 15 minutes or would you rather me do a 10 hour Picross stream?
[295:16.90]Starting now.
[295:24.79]Wow, really?
[295:26.09]Really?
[295:26.51]I don't buy that for a second.

[306:27.12]I still love the Merchant Brothers and I believe in merchants of this company.
[306:29.74]I feel it is only right to stand with my friends in these trying times and move to a new company.
[306:37.12]So they have moved to the Psy Freelands.
[306:40.06]They are no longer on this console.
[306:48.59]Interesting stuff.

[341:04.09]You've been... Ha, ha, ha, ha, you're hilarious.
[341:06.59]Did you seriously just report me, dude?
[341:08.57]What?
[341:09.43]When, who did I report?
[341:20.34]I didn't report Dylan.
[341:21.88]When did I do that?
[341:27.71]Wait, was that him sharing the music?
[341:32.33]Welcome back, Jerma.
[341:34.74]It's been 35 days since you last logged on.
[341:38.42]Wow, that's a lot.
[341:39.72]That page was his.
[341:41.12]I'm sitting there just like crunching on a Butterfinger.
[341:50.80]Why is it a Butterfinger?
[341:52.26]I don't know.
[341:56.41]I have nothing else after that.
[341:58.09]I don't know why it was a Butterfinger and it fucked up my whole statement.
[342:03.48]Most stable secure release yet.
[342:04.88]No crashes.
[342:05.74]Okay.
[342:11.75]I don't know where that even came from.

[342:16.57]Okay.
[342:28.12]This is sleek You are now on active duty Alright, let me see what the hell is going on here Change your passwords.
[342:39.45]Okay pirated music
[342:52.62]This is from Dylan.
[342:53.74]Did you seriously just report me?
[342:55.14]Dude, did you think I wouldn't notice?
[342:57.21]I don't know if this was you being funny or what, because everyone shares music nowadays.
[343:02.75]But the fact of the matter is that our whole team knows about my Flist page now.
[343:07.71]If any of our interns are snitches, you could really cause a problem for me and the entire company.
[343:15.12]We're doing some amazing things over here and I'll be damned if some little idiot is going to bring it crashing down because they wanted to be funny.
[343:22.10]I'm taking you off duty.
[343:23.08]You're lucky I'm not banning you.
[343:24.86]I was just listening to his whole playlist and reporting every line of text.
[343:32.45]That was my boss's webpage.
[343:36.92]Okay, you've been removed from active enforcement.
[343:41.76]No.
[343:43.16]You will not receive cases or HSPD communications until you're placed back on active duty.
[343:47.18]Thank you.
[343:50.57]This has been an automated alert sent to Jerma.
[343:52.51]Enforce your punishment.
[343:53.43]I don't get it.
[344:01.97]You're now on active enforcement.
[344:03.09]This is an automated message.
[344:03.93]You're back on active enforcement.
[344:05.79]Okay.
[344:06.88]Oops, I'm so sorry.
[344:11.63]Hi, Jeremiah.
[344:12.05]So I don't know if it was me or the system or whatever.
[344:15.18]It looks like you were removed from the active enforcer list, which means you've probably been really bored of the last few weeks.
[344:21.62]This very well could have been my mistake.
[344:23.20]And I'm so, so sorry.
[344:24.94]Not an excuse, but I don't think I've ever been this exhausted at a job.
[344:28.66]Our interns are off for the holidays.
[344:30.46]So Dylan has some of us pulling double duty with HSPD stuff and our normal tasks.
[344:37.69]I've just added you back as an active enforcer.
[344:40.36]You receive cases after the year 2000 update finishes installing.
[344:43.32]See you in the new millennium.
[344:44.56]Sorry again.
[344:47.27]Okay.
[344:50.59]So Dylan removed us and then she put us back on.
[344:52.87]So does she not know that we're on the team again?
[344:57.51]Someone has hacked into the Teen Topia main page and are threatening some sort of attack.
[345:02.47]I'm not sure what you enforcers can do about this, but if I don't assign the case, I'll never hear the end of it from my bosses.
[345:09.07]Since the violations are on official Merchantsoft pages, the system will reject any quick checks you do.
[345:15.42]It would be an easy fix if everyone with administrative access wasn't out of the office.
[345:20.80]Still, look into it if you think you can find a way to stop it.
[345:26.48]Okay.
[345:29.36]So the violations that are on official Merchantsoft pages, the system will reject any quick checks you do.
[345:40.38]This is a malicious software notice regarding an admitted year 2000 hacker in Teentopia.
[345:45.05]Please figure out how to disable or prevent the attack.
[345:47.91]I wish we didn't have to do this important things in caps thing because it's a pain to keep it consistent.
[345:53.89]Yeah, this operating system sucks.
[345:58.97]Alright, so, malicious software, we're gonna find it, we're gonna track it down in Teentopia.
[346:08.88]Yeah, there sure is something going on in Teentopia right now.
[346:17.54]It's the same guy, it's Tim.
[346:23.88]The Y2000 mine crash cometh.
[346:26.42]The digital parasites you love so much are in danger.
[346:28.82]Only one can stop it.
[346:31.00]If only you'd make peace with your blessed, imparted name.
[346:36.11]Mother of son of... Mother of son of Tim, dearest chosen one.
[346:40.33]Then you could save them.
[346:43.65]Time until mine crash.
[346:46.13]What?
[346:48.05]Accept thy name and input it here.
[346:49.25]I don't know what it is back...

[348:39.56]Okay, unfed and ignore, their happiness will decrease.

[349:42.61]It's 15.
[349:50.79]Can I have two?
[349:51.41]No.
[350:15.33]I'm in the third grade.
[350:16.17]I found these planets on Hypnospace.
[350:18.55]These planets are made up.
[350:19.83]They're not real ones in outer space.
[350:21.33]I like them because they are fun to imagine about.
[350:24.83]Two new planets.
[350:30.20]Crazy planet.
[350:32.10]It can't make up its mind that this planet will just waste your time, and it can't choose, so everyone yells at it, hurry up, hurry up.
[350:40.50]Girl and boy planets.
[350:42.36]Mom told me about these new planets.
[350:43.76]The boy one is blue and the girl one is pink.
[350:45.98]They can make a little baby planet.
[350:47.54]The boy planet is not allowed to play with my toys, so I am happy.
[350:55.57]New planets.
[350:56.17]Tiny planet.
[350:56.81]This planet is so small, it has swimming ants living on it.
[351:01.59]There's the mustard planet.
[351:03.67]Quick, quick, quick!
[351:04.39]I gotta get the first one!
[351:07.08]Got it!
[351:07.44]Yes, thank God.
[351:08.66]I got the first one.
[351:12.03]This planet has mustard instead of water like normal.
[351:14.35]It is where the mustard comes from.
[351:17.45]They have mustard spaceships that go get it and bring it to the king foods on Earth.
[351:22.43]I can't read this.
[351:25.01]This is a big one.
[351:25.75]This planet is made out of lines and water splashes.
[351:28.55]Only fish lives in the water splashes.
[351:33.80]Rebecca the planet.
[351:34.64]I named this planet Rebecca.
[351:35.72]Rebecca is my sister.
[351:38.06]All kinds of shapes on this one.
[351:42.07]Josh the Planet.
[351:42.89]This planet gets mad all the time for no good reason.
[351:45.21]That's why I call it Josh.
[351:48.84]Jesus the Planet.
[351:49.84]This planet is pretty like God.
[351:51.75]That's why I call it Jesus.
[351:54.43]Moon planet.
[351:55.07]This is moon.
[351:55.51]This is different than the normal moon.
[351:57.37]It has waterfalls on it and a secret rainforest on the inside of it.
[352:01.33]Me and my friends were digging here and that's when we discovered the rainforest with monkeys.
[352:06.27]Moon 2, the planet.
[352:07.21]This is the moon planet 2.
[352:08.81]It is not the normal moon.
[352:09.87]It is the foe of water like a water balloon.
[352:12.73]Do not poke it.
[352:14.65]This brain protected by beef brain.
[352:19.26]Beef brain shield.
[352:22.82]Note to other parents and kids.
[352:24.78]Hello, this is Ashley's mother once again.
[352:26.50]I can't understand why none of you care about your children, but since it is obvious that you don't, I don't want her learning things from your bad eggs.
[352:34.18]Ashley is forbidden to talk to any of the other kids in Teentopia, and her chitchat... What the fuck was that?
[352:40.98]...has been deleted.
[352:41.88]Do not send her messages.

[353:12.48]Oh, come on.

[353:16.51]I don't know what the fuck it was.
[353:19.90]Oh my god, this operating system is going to make me die.
[353:21.72]16882A.
[353:23.00]What's her name?
[353:30.64]Ashley.
[353:34.38]Ashley Planet.
[353:39.62]No, that's too... Okay, just Ashley.
[353:41.76]She's a planet girl.
[353:46.44]Why do I need everybody's ID?
[353:47.62]I don't know.
[353:54.25]That's Rebecca Aldrin's sister from earlier.
[353:56.27]Yeah, that's interesting.
[353:58.29]It's all connected.

[361:34.35]Who owns this?
[361:35.35]Not registered.
[361:36.15]Alright.
[361:42.94]It's Legos, except it's painful.
[361:44.40]Yeah, I can see that.
[361:49.28]I don't get it.
[361:53.33]Oh, I get it.
[362:15.48]That was like a 2 out of 10 for fun.
[362:30.77]I made that!
[362:31.65]Aw, you did?
[362:32.71]Sorry!
[362:33.19]Alright, that's it for that.
[362:40.48]Alright, Squish Champ.
[362:42.20]This page was deleted.
[362:43.42]Please remove this page.
[362:47.36]I'd like to name a page Squishy Champ 500 in the zone.
[362:51.26]Good time.
[362:51.66]Please call... Who?
[362:53.16]What?
[362:54.44]Something hidden here?
[362:59.09]Nothing hidden.
[363:00.27]Interesting.
[363:06.33]Yeah, how's Zane doing?
[363:07.17]Let's find out.
[363:14.34]Or Cory.
[363:14.82]Let's do Zane.
[363:18.56]This is Zane.
[363:19.22]My name on here is Zane Rocks, but now I'm 15.
[363:23.08]My mom gets shoes at the dollar store.
[363:25.07]New updates.
[363:27.47]I'm on free lunch because my mom works at a gas station and barely even keeps that job going.
[363:34.35]My most boyfriend pays for Hypnospace so I don't hear them going wild all night in her room.
[363:38.39]What the fuck is going on here?
[363:44.36]About saying 11.
[363:45.98]Age 11.
[363:50.56]Uh... 15?
[363:52.26]Why are you 11?
[363:56.18]Great farts.
[363:58.40]Favorite music.
[363:58.92]Girl music.
[363:59.56]Not seepage because they suck.
[364:00.84]He got hacked.
[364:03.14]Favorite movies.
[364:03.90]Nude dudes too.
[364:04.98]Naked crimes.
[364:05.86]Favorite games.
[364:06.46]Anything where you pet horses.
[364:07.68]Yeah, he got hacked.
[364:11.04]I'm with Corey now.
[364:11.94]Big secret.
[364:12.68]Shh.
[364:14.73]Oh, he's eating free lunch, pretending to not suck, stalking girls on chitchat.
[364:19.65]Jennifer's the hacker.
[364:25.77]Jennifer's behind the whole Y2K incident.
[364:34.25]What else you got here?
[364:36.37]What about the comics page?
[364:40.99]No, that's... any new comics?
[364:50.32]I got speed.
[364:51.14]What's with this?
[364:57.61]Okay, what about Cory?
[364:58.45]Okay, here's Cory.
[365:06.79]Pull up a chair.
[365:07.45]You're at Attention Teentopia.
[365:09.82]This is Cory again.
[365:10.98]After having a big talk with my parents, I have decided that I must come clean with you all.
[365:15.93]I did not really have a girlfriend.
[365:17.87]The page I made was fake.
[365:19.35]I'm very sorry for being deceptive, and I hope that you will forgive me.
[365:22.41]The reason I made this page is because I was embarrassed that everyone else on here had a girlfriend, but I did not.
[365:27.61]I thought it would make me look cool.
[365:29.76]Well, as you can see now, I was wrong about that.
[365:32.58]I promise never to lie again on here.
[365:34.74]My parents have agreed to allow me one more chance to straighten out.
[365:38.26]So it's back to good old classic Cory with the jokes and the pizza.
[365:42.80]I'm sorry I tried to change who I really am.
[365:45.10]Sincerely, Cory.
[365:50.79]So what... So what's going on with Zane's page? ...
[366:09.97]Let me see this.
[366:12.17]Zane... Zane Lofton.
[366:14.50]1147... 11470A.
[366:16.62]No, this is a different person!
[366:18.04]Corey Paul Henderson.
[366:38.97]Wait, is Jennifer's page still up?
[366:45.55]Alright, Squisher Quest, Squisher's... Rabe, uh, Rabie... Rabe's Rootspin?
[366:52.17]Jessica's page.
[366:53.28]I have broken up with... Hello, this is Tiffany.
[366:55.28]The reason I broke... This is a real person?
[366:59.06]No, it's not.
[366:59.66]So this is Zane.
[367:02.42]He uses way too much cheap cologne.
[367:03.72]He's lame.
[367:04.20]Also, seepage sucks.
[367:14.20]Alright, Pizza Boogie.
[367:15.26]Have your parents take you to Dr. Pizza.
[367:16.82]We've seen this, right?
[367:21.80]Alright, we gotta get this hacker.
[367:23.27]It's time to go into the guy's files.
[367:26.23]Hacked the fake Grayson.
[367:29.45]We have not been here.
[367:31.81]This is the most popular Hypnospace page.
[367:33.87]I can draw every car or motorcycle for $1.00.
[367:40.50]If you go to Lake Wales High School and can give me a dollar, I will draw you a car or motorcycle for you.
[367:44.74]I can draw also a few characters from cartoons.
[367:47.34]Thanks, it helps a lot.
[367:48.62]I'm 14 years old, and my favorite subject is art.
[367:56.88]Uh, alright.
[367:57.64]Alright, alright, alright.

[372:31.33]Hey, Marshmallow, or I mean Tiff.
[372:33.59]It's me, Tim.
[372:34.19]I'm sorry if this comes off as weird, but I didn't know how else to get you to hear me out.
[372:37.78]I just want to say I'm sorry for whatever I did to hurt or offend you, and I hope we get to talk soon.
[372:43.29]I really miss our conversations.
[372:44.45]You are really important to me and I don't want to throw away what we had.
[372:48.37]Too soft.
[372:48.91]Maybe take this out before posting.
[372:51.08]There's no mind crash.
[372:52.98]It's just a silly thing I did to get you to read this page.
[372:56.60]Chit chat me and let's work on something together.
[372:59.40]You can write the whole thing and I'll just do the art and music.
[373:02.52]It'll be all yours.
[373:03.92]Love, Tim.
[373:05.90]P.S.
[373:07.00]I was using that chit-chat spying program to watch Merchantsoft's internal conversations, and I think you were totally right about Hypnospace causing your migraines.
[373:16.87]They seem like they know it's bad for people but don't care.
[373:20.27]Want to move to cyber worlds, maybe?
[373:22.89]Note to self, have Teentopia reset to normal after she sees this.
[373:27.89]Tiff.
[373:29.33]Tiff.
[373:32.03]Welcome to Tiff now, okay.
[373:38.30]Encrypted file.
[373:40.44]I know how to deal with an encrypted file!
[373:49.79]Which files do you need protected?
[373:52.69]What is sandwich encryption?
[373:56.95]While sandwich isn't officially supported by HypnoOS, there may be a way to decrypt locked sandwich files.
[374:03.30]You'll have to chitchat me for more information.
[374:09.76]Roddy Wall, as mentioned above, he helped invent Sam, which may also be able to help.
[374:14.04]He's currently working on Hypnospace's virtual pets game and has a page in Hypnospace.
[374:21.66]Pets, huh?
[374:26.36]Really?
[374:29.58]Wouldn't that be interesting?
[374:37.00]Do it.
[374:38.26]Come on.
[374:41.82]Yes!
[374:44.04]Yes!
[374:44.66]I didn't even- I didn't even think about it!
[374:46.36]I was perfect!
[374:47.34]Perfect!
[374:54.62]Install- Wait!
[374:55.26]I don't know what this is!
[374:56.22]Should I install it?
[374:57.28]Don't do it yet.
[375:02.18]How do I go back and get that again?
[375:10.09]I still own it, right?
[375:12.92]No, I can just go right on his website.
[375:14.64]I can get it.
[375:21.15]That was such an over-the-top reaction.
[375:23.95]I thought that was it.
[375:31.82]Relax.
[375:34.90]But, okay, hold on.
[375:36.88]This is it.
[375:37.44]I got it.
[375:49.44]Come on, that was funny.
[375:52.02]Alright, here we go.
[375:53.16]Installing all seeing eye.
[375:57.77]You have been blessed with second sight.
[376:01.21]Have I?
[376:05.45]Sees all.
[376:07.63]Sees all.
[376:10.11]Interesting.
[376:17.53]I probably have to put something up here.
[376:19.57]Like an icon or... A webpage, maybe?
[376:24.33]Oh, well, there you go.
[376:28.40]Okay, seize all.
[376:31.78]Seize all.
[376:32.32]We'll put it over here for now.
[376:34.22]But first, I need to... I need to... I mean, you're going to fucking jail.
[376:42.23]Like, just... Like, let's be honest here.
[377:01.48]Alright, what about Tim's actual webpage?
[377:06.28]The one with all the shit all over it.
[377:13.52]Uh, Teentopia?
[377:14.94]Okay, this is off.
[377:15.52]Hold on, let's see.
[377:20.12]I told you it was the guidance counselor.
[377:21.43]No, never mind.
[377:37.72]It's Tim's website, it has to be.
[377:47.38]Look at the- what does it say?
[377:48.04]Look at the what?
[377:49.66]You've reached to Tim- what does it say?
[378:02.74]No, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[378:04.46]The deleted page.
[378:05.42]Come on.
[378:17.58]Stop that.
[378:22.14]Shit.
[378:22.90]It's not here?
[378:23.42]Come on.
[378:33.18]I'll find it.
[378:55.18]Wait.
[378:56.54]Did I just catch something?
[378:59.86]Shit!
[379:06.41]What about Tiffany's?
[379:07.21]Does Tiffany have a website?
[379:21.76]Ooh!
[379:25.48]You probably don't belong here.
[379:26.54]If you are in need of an attainment, check out Dork Twilight Tiff.
[379:30.28]Got it.
[379:32.82]And now I know who you are.
[379:34.26]She isn't a hacker, but her stories are amazing.
[379:37.20]Mm-hmm.
[379:40.18]Who will watch the Watchmen only those with true sight may enter.
[379:44.90]With the UIV.
[379:48.98]Oh, here we go.
[379:52.07]Enter the fleshy domain of Timageddon
[380:03.27]Enter the fleshy domain of Timageddon.
[380:08.13]Butthole.
[380:10.11]Testing, testing, this is cool.
[380:11.65]Oh no, I can't see what I'm typing.
[380:14.95]Click to enter.
[380:21.54]Okay, hold on.
[380:26.88]Dark twilight tiff.
[380:29.48]I feel like I should do that first.
[380:32.51]Beyond Twilight.
[380:37.98]Give me that info.
[380:38.60]Got ya!
[380:40.52]17105A!
[380:58.58]Are we asleep or awake?
[380:59.57]How can we really ever know?
[381:01.23]In these mystical tomes are tales I've penned.
[381:04.07]Oh, I've already been here.
[381:06.10]Some nice and sweet, some dark and grim in my stories nothing is sure of.
[381:10.08]What?
[381:11.19]Was that a knock on your door?
[381:12.45]Yeah, we've already been here.
[381:16.76]I'm a 16-year-old girl from a small town in the Midwest.
[381:18.66]Pretty boring humdrum life before Hypnospace.
[381:21.77]Hmm.
[381:22.29]Nothing else interesting to say.
[381:23.39]I like black licorice like a freak.
[381:25.69]I'm not dating.
[381:26.33]I have epilepsy, but haven't had any seizures in many years.
[381:29.62]Okay.
[381:30.18]My picks.
[381:38.63]My friend Linda has been making amazing scaries.
[381:41.17]Alright, Linda.
[381:41.95]All words by Tiffany.
[381:43.35]If you want to use or repost art, you have to use Tim McGeddon.
[381:47.85]We no longer associate, so talk to him yourself if you want permission.
[381:59.64]Yeah, we've been here too.
[382:00.58]Okay.
[382:03.54]Alright.
[382:04.72]I'm going into Tim's domain here.
[382:14.30]Tim McGeddon.
[382:16.93]The only good community in Hypnospace if you know how to read it.
[382:19.69]Minx.
[382:21.97]Tim McGeddon is proud to present the year 2000 mind crash.
[382:27.79]Can she save us?
[382:30.53]A.K.A.
[382:30.95]Marshmallow, we work...
[382:37.65]Alright, any discernible things I need to know here?
[382:39.63]Okay, we got... That's a machete.
[382:41.83]She's holding a machete in her hand.
[382:43.95]Covering her face.
[382:48.23]What is this?
[382:48.95]Is it a snowboard?
[382:49.89]Skis?
[382:51.37]Is it a... Coral bar?
[382:57.94]Oh, right.
[382:58.48]Just fucking here.
[383:05.68]Just fucking eat.
[383:08.79]I'm busy.
[383:09.23]Okay, you're good.
[383:26.54]Is there like a hidden message here?
[383:37.65]No.
[383:58.02]That's making me laugh.
[384:04.02]Okay, we're getting there.
[384:08.59]Haven't heard from her in a few days.
[384:09.89]If you know Tiff, let me know if she's okay.
[384:12.51]Good file sharing zone, lots of free music, Juarez cracks, etc.
[384:17.35]Oh, so you found our humble home.
[384:18.85]It is I, son of Tim.
[384:20.92]Tim is out planning the apocalypse at the moment.
[384:23.28]But if you'd leave your name, number, and a brief message, he'd gladly return your call in hell.
[384:30.38]Mr. Potato Head with a mustache and a pig nose making a lot of laughing sounds.
[384:37.32]Anything else here?
[384:38.02]That's kind of scary looking.
[384:51.21]Can I click this?
[384:51.99]No.
[384:57.13]Alright, I think we're gonna go in.
[385:01.53]Can she save us?
[385:05.26]No.
[385:06.12]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[385:07.40]What?
[385:07.68]Wait, wait.
[385:08.26]Hey!
[385:09.72]No, no, no, no.
[385:10.72]Go back.
[385:13.40]Wait, I have to get the password, right?
[385:14.85]It's like, probably Tiffany or something.
[385:17.97]The code.
[385:19.37]What's the code?
[385:27.13]What was the code?
[385:27.97]It was... It's... Only one... If only you'd make peace with your blessed and pardoned name.
[385:40.16]Mother of son of Tim.
[385:42.18]Dearest chosen one.
[385:51.25]Oh, okay.
[385:52.01]It's Marshmallow.
[385:53.03]Yep.
[385:56.43]Why am I shouting?
[385:57.13]Because actually it's kind of loud.
[386:02.36]Here we go.
[386:12.16]Thank you, thank you, thank you!
[386:14.18]Hey Marshmallow- I mean Tiff.
[386:17.10]It's me, Tim.
[386:18.14]I'm sorry that this is another one of my weird things, but I didn't know how else to get you to hear me out.
[386:23.01]I just wanted to say sorry for whatever I did to hurt or offend you, and I hope we get to talk soon.
[386:27.65]I really miss our conversations.
[386:29.37]You're really important to me, and I don't want to throw what we had away.
[386:33.90]There is no Minecraft.
[386:34.74]It's just a silly thing to get you to read this page, chit-chat me, and let's work something out.
[386:39.08]We already read this.
[386:40.90]Love, Tim.
[386:42.30]P.S.
[386:42.60]Want to move to cyber worlds?
[386:43.93]Maybe...
[386:46.18]A hacker good I'm friends with found some evidence that Hypnospace is really dangerous to your health, so I'm probably going to get off here as long as you come with me.
[387:02.13]Dr. Boulder misses you too.
[387:05.41]What's with the weird thing that was knocking on the guy's door?
[387:13.21]Okay, so I stopped it.
[387:19.54]If you're Minx, chit-chat me.
[387:20.92]Disable scary stuff.
[387:24.02]Uh, well, not yet.
[387:32.97]Minx, go away!
[387:33.79]If you can't figure out how to access this login, link below.
[387:36.07]You definitely don't belong here.
[387:41.17]If you want an account, talk to one of us.
[387:43.79]All decisions are made by committee.
[387:45.26]Troubleshooting.
[387:56.45]God damn, you guys have long pages.
[388:05.59]Wah, wah, Minx looks all messed up.
[388:08.83]I can't read it.
[388:11.55]Don't worry about it.
[388:16.08]You'll never afford the software anyways.
[388:20.04]Joke's on you.
[388:21.72]I got myself a copy.
[388:23.86]Alright, here we go.
[388:24.50]Enter here.
[388:26.54]Enter minx here.
[388:28.50]Enter your password.
[388:29.44]I don't know what the fucking password is.
[388:31.32]What's the password?
[388:33.48]Marshmallow?
[388:52.32]No, that's not it.
[388:54.52]The password's not going to be 1234, guys.
[389:01.26]I don't have this password.
[389:11.52]No.
[389:13.67]I don't have this.
[389:14.15]Alright, let's go back and turn off the scary stuff.
[389:24.70]Marshmallow.
[389:25.24]Here we go.
[389:36.99]Caps lock on.
[389:42.89]Alright.
[389:46.24]Hey, Marshmallow.
[389:46.92]Disable scary stuff.
[389:47.80]Shouldn't I report this first?
[389:57.98]Rolled up.
[390:02.83]Disabled!
[390:03.47]Hypnospace 2.0.
[390:12.09]Okay.
[390:12.43]I did it.
[390:38.21]Can I get rid of this thing now?
[390:43.34]Uh, you stopped the mine crash.
[390:47.98]Come on.
[390:49.50]Oh, Jeremy, good job.
[390:53.22]We saw this page, but couldn't figure out what the password was.
[390:56.39]Sam.
[390:58.09]Oh, I did it.
[390:58.77]What?
[391:04.77]What?
[391:15.71]How do I get... Installing outlaw package 1 of 2.
[391:19.73]At least just give me... Give me my money at least first.
[391:24.27]It's the antivirus.
[391:27.40]This is not a virus.
[391:41.14]I can't get out of here.
[391:43.78]It's taking over my computer.
[391:51.37]delete outlaw oh I don't I don't have it where is it I can't uninstall it
[392:16.37]Yep.
[392:17.31]What do you need?
[392:25.13]No!
[392:26.15]Not my pet!
[392:30.22]Oh shit, he's dying!
[392:31.92]Quick, buy food for the hamster!
[392:34.10]Quick!
[392:34.34]Before he dies!
[392:58.16]I can't power anything off.
[393:02.36]Jesus.
[393:14.75]Remove from quarantine.
[393:15.69]Alright, I got a virus.
[393:32.65]So am I dead?
[393:33.17]If I die in the game, I die in real life.
[393:34.43]Am I in the real world?
[393:51.78]I got beef-brained.
[393:58.92]That's the guy from Starz videos.
[394:00.14]What happened?
[394:01.42]A late night live commentary.
[394:04.21]What happened to Stirr?
[394:05.57]It really is a fiber detector.
[394:30.55]So the little teen hacker is going to jail.
[394:36.27]He was hit by multiple trucks and died.
[394:40.40]Okay, so.
[394:42.56]The virus killed six people.
[394:51.80]Years later.
[394:59.59]It was a setup.
[395:05.33]It wasn't a mine crash virus, yeah.
[395:07.15]So what?
[395:09.91]I'm alive.
[395:22.44]Keep all new content here.
[395:23.82]Do not create new content or manipulate old Hypnospace captures.
[395:27.24]Be nice.
[395:28.54]It's an archival project.
[395:32.69]Get to know your fellow Archival Project team members all about the mine crash and what happened at the end of it all.
[395:39.50]Looking back, the end of sleep time.
[395:42.78]The Y2000 mine crash was the year 2000 event.
[395:46.48]Without it, our biggest Y2K problems would have been two malfunctioning bus ticket validation machines in Australia and a couple dozen disappointed End Times preachers.
[395:58.70]What's the date?
[396:00.32]Oh shit, it's today.
[396:02.46]This is actually right now.
[396:07.13]That's pretty cool.
[396:09.93]The mine crash wasn't the fault of a computer programming oversight or date-related bug.
[396:14.01]Its cause was an out-of-control joke virus created by a teenager in an attempt to impress an exclusive underground hacker group.
[396:24.06]Teen Hacker.
[396:27.14]Okay.
[396:29.32]creator of Minecraft.
[396:30.80]Timothy Randall Stevens, the California teen hacker responsible for the year 2000 Minecraft virus that left at least six Hypnospace users dead, has become the first juvenile charged in federal court with manslaughter by way of computer hacking.
[396:44.43]Stevens, who went by the Hypnospace handle Timageddon, will serve up to six years in federal prison for the crime on December 31st.
[396:53.99]Stevens.
[396:55.82]Tim served six years in prison and emerged a changed person.
[396:59.18]He reached out to me last year about helping with the HAP and we're happy to have him.
[397:04.48]He's currently working on a program to help preserve data from special enforcer headband units.
[397:10.71]Huh.
[397:12.27]In Tim's words.
[397:13.37]Hi all, Tim Stevens here.
[397:15.17]I hope that after two decades you'll be able to forgive me and understand that I'm not the person I was at
[397:31.62]you're still alive okay good to know after 20 years uh okay hold on my actions back then were driven by juvenile insecurities I've had a long time to grapple with the pain I caused people and make amends with the surviving family members of those who passed
[397:56.22]Things were difficult after I left prison, but I'm happy to say that I've since been blessed with a wife and a little girl.
[398:02.85]I'm open to talk if anyone has questions.
[398:05.45]The victims.
[398:07.87]Oh shit, Zane's dead.
[398:11.82]Twi- Tiff- Tiffany's dead?
[398:14.98]I don't know who the hell this is.
[398:15.96]This person's just a random person.
[398:17.78]I don't think we even came across this person.
[398:20.76]Same with this person.
[398:22.82]I don't think we know any of these people.
[398:25.05]Zane's dead!
[398:29.54]Oh, Mavis was the old lady.
[398:31.72]Burn Rubber 50.
[398:33.35]Carl Parker.
[398:34.71]Dead.
[398:36.19]Ringleader Roddy.
[398:37.29]Roddy is dead too.
[398:40.37]Oh, come on.
[398:42.15]Zane was my favorite character.
[398:48.22]What about Corey?
[398:48.94]Corey is alive.
[398:52.61]Well, okay, here's the product recall.
[398:54.70]Hold on.
[398:55.90]Please discontinue usage of the Hypnospace headband immediately.
[398:59.58]This product carries serious risks and may result in injury or fatality.
[399:03.88]Merchantsoft is offering refunds of the product in cooperation with the CPSC.
[399:10.02]Product codes, the Hypnospace headband manufacturing dates 1998 to 1999.
[399:15.82]Devices recalled in the US 64,424 nation- Oh my fucking god, it just- delete them.
[399:22.77]I don't want you anymore.
[399:24.11]How do I get rid of you?
[399:24.97]You're ruining every moment that happens on this screen.
[399:28.21]Every single one.
[399:31.11]There is no delete tool.
[399:32.29]You just stay- you just shit and fart and make noises.
[399:38.48]The Hypnospace headband and accompanying Hypnospace software contain exploits that allow users to manipulate the quality and duration of sleep for other users.
[399:52.21]Five fatalities and 340 injuries have been reported after an incident on the morning of January 1st, 2000.
[399:56.93]That's kind of insane.
[400:02.43]Timageddon.
[400:03.79]We got this one in Tim Words.
[400:06.97]I'll go back here.
[400:10.71]Uh, this is everything here.
[400:14.60]Who is this?
[400:15.68]T. Frost here.
[400:16.42]Yes, the same T. Frost who wrote Between the Angry Spaces.
[400:18.88]Who the hell are you?
[400:20.84]Tamara Frost.
[400:22.90]You don't have an ID.
[400:28.29]This is the Hypnospace Archival Project profile page of Tamara Frost.
[400:32.94]It is not an original archive Hypnospace page.
[400:36.38]Hello, everyone.
[400:37.04]I'm Tamara, perhaps better known as T Frost.
[400:40.38]When Chelsea reached out to me about supporting the HAP, I literally jumped for joy.
[400:45.48]There was something special about Hypnospace.
[400:47.27]It felt like a livid in place.
[400:50.05]That folks out there trying to preserve its history inspires me greatly.
[400:53.73]Sorry about the old picture.
[400:58.82]Did you use Hypnospace in 98-99?
[401:01.10]Sure did.
[401:02.86]If so, did you do anything embarrassing?
[401:05.64]I'm not so sure.
[401:06.24]It's been ages from my age at the time.
[401:08.00]It was highly probable.
[401:09.94]Young Tamara didn't know where to take her life.
[401:12.80]She was an autumn leaf blown every which way by people and social movements and her own creative whims.
[401:18.73]What do you have to know?
[401:20.16]I'm a poet for children.
[401:22.60]I wrote a few anthologies that kids, your kids, have probably seen at their school library.
[401:28.20]Between the Angry Spaces and River, River, River, River.
[401:34.67]How's Chowder Man doing?
[401:36.87]Okay.
[401:38.67]Interesting.
[401:40.93]Okay, let's see.
[401:45.24]Tim's page.
[401:46.10]Tim Stevens profile.
[401:48.26]There he is.
[401:51.22]This is not an original archive.
[401:52.44]Okay, thanks for all the warm welcome.
[401:53.66]Please read my page before sending me any messages directly.
[401:55.70]Thank you.
[401:59.84]I'm just gonna let it die.
[402:01.31]I'm sorry.
[402:03.37]It's a little strange using this page builder so many years later, but yes, hi, I'm Tim.
[402:07.77]Yep, the same Tim you probably heard about back in 2000.
[402:10.63]Yes, I went to prison, and yes, I spent the whole six years there.
[402:13.49]I'm much different now as anyone is after adolescence.
[402:17.20]I did use hyper Hypnospace in 98.
[402:20.53]You do anything embarrassing?
[402:22.27]I'm not really sure how to answer this one.
[402:23.65]Embarrassing is not the right word for what I caused.
[402:26.29]I still think about it every day and I'm deeply, deeply sorry for it.
[402:32.63]I was a kid messing around with tech that I knew almost nothing about.
[402:36.50]My entire world revolved around wooing a girl I was infatuated with and getting into a hacker group and I would have done anything to impress either of them.
[402:47.82]I had no idea that I'd even be capable of harming people with the software I had made.
[402:50.94]It was all so, so stupid.
[402:54.76]I now work in computer security and live a contended, contented life with my wife and daughter.
[403:01.69]Okay.
[403:01.99]Okay.
[403:11.29]Oh, we have Chelsea.
[403:13.87]Chelsea's page.
[403:16.59]I'm Chelsea, the HAP co-lead along with Tamara.
[403:20.75]Sorry about the lack of picture.
[403:21.69]I'll have to get a suitable one uploaded soon.
[403:23.23]I'm Chelsea.
[403:23.73]It's unlikely that anyone remembers me since I never made my own Hypnospace page or used chitchat, but Hypnospace was a very important part of my life.
[403:31.87]This whole project was my idea.
[403:34.48]Thankfully, Tamara was interested enough to help flip the bill.
[403:38.88]I did use it.
[403:40.58]Do anything embarrassing?
[403:41.38]Nope.
[403:41.60]If I ever got around to making a page, I wouldn't have plenty.
[403:43.80]I'd have plenty to share.
[403:44.64]Okay.
[403:46.69]Not a whole lot, really.
[403:47.43]Just working a boring office job and reminiscing about Hypnospace in my off time.
[403:50.99]Can't wait to see what we're able to dig up.
[403:54.55]Alright, only a couple more.
[403:57.98]Artie.
[403:59.20]Artie dispenses profile.
[404:02.48]Time, flow, flow, time, steaming.
[404:05.22]Gone, gone, gone, gone.
[404:09.42]Okay.
[404:11.92]Did you use Hypnospace?
[404:13.08]Hypnospace, did we really use it or did it use us?
[404:17.56]If so, did you do anything embarrassing?
[404:19.02]Embarrassment is shame.
[404:20.32]Humiliation is hurt.
[404:21.50]Embarrassment is not me, not us.
[404:25.02]What are you up to now?
[404:25.82]Lover, designer, giver, breeder of hope, agent of peace, wonder-filled spirit is me.
[404:33.37]Copy and paste that and put that on your Tinder profile.
[404:37.43]Because that's where it belongs.
[404:43.69]Okay.
[404:47.26]And this is where we post requests for things that we're trying to find in the old Hypnospace backups.
[404:51.60]Help us locate them.
[404:53.98]You've laughed at every fart.
[404:55.46]I have not laughed at every single fart.
[404:57.90]Absolutely not.
[404:59.38]No way.
[405:03.52]Can you mute your mic?
[405:04.78]I have not laughed at every single one.
[405:07.48]You bring me documented proof.
[405:10.80]I did not.
[405:12.54]No, I did not.
[405:13.80]Bullshit.
[405:14.54]I don't believe it.
[405:18.60]Here's where we'll list the things that we believe may exist only in Hypnospace and would otherwise be lost to time.
[405:24.48]All you need to do is view the page that these things exist on and they'll be sent to us and archived.
[405:30.36]Okay.
[405:32.22]Please do your best to find them, Jerma, as your headband backups may be our last hope.
[405:39.39]Okay, the Chowder Man song.
[405:41.17]Okay, I found one.
[405:44.70]Adrian wanted to know if you'd dig up a song that the Chowder Man wrote about his helicopter accident.
[405:48.74]I got that one.
[405:50.66]Yeah.
[405:52.88]This is something I'm missing.
[405:53.84]A close friend of mine and famous rap star remembers putting his music on Hypnospace when he was in his early 20s, but never really getting any attention.
[406:02.99]All he remembers is that some guy deleted him from a listing saying that his music wasn't real music because it was flip-flop and that he should do something more imaginative.
[406:13.30]Finding this would be a huge deal.
[406:16.43]uh Roddy's early test pet I'm almost certain that Roddy made an odd-looking test pet early in November that looked like that comic book floating eye he always talked about would love to play with it again weird secret eye cult all kinds of pages with a strange encryption eye on them if my memory serves I'm pretty sure even Adrian Merchant had that symbol somewhere can you find out what that's all about
[406:43.91]Missing person, Demetri Jackson.
[406:46.95]The daughter and ex-wife of a Demetri Jackson have contacted us requesting any information we could find on what may have happened to cause his disappearance in 1999.
[406:53.39]No, I'm laughing now because I'm trying not to laugh because I know that people think I'm laughing at it.
[407:22.41]All they know is that he was using Hypnospace frequently at the time and was communicating frequently with a rich guy who was going to help him fund some sort of sea voyage.
[407:31.41]What?
[407:33.82]That's me.
[407:43.74]I killed him.
[407:45.68]What?
[407:46.38]No, I didn't.
[407:52.46]I caused him to die?
[407:53.98]No.
[407:54.62]Let me check my emails.
[407:58.75]You found the Chowder Man tune.
[408:03.11]Yep.
[408:04.81]Welcome to the archive project.
[408:09.27]I knew there had to be someone out there with a working enforcement... There is no mail.
[408:12.84]Can I just...
[408:17.82]So yeah, this is the, me and a few former Hypnospace users formed a ragtag group to preserve content from the services late 1990 period, just before the crash.
[408:28.66]We've been unable to find anyone involved with Merchantsoft outside of Arty, which is a story in itself.
[408:34.50]And we're pretty certain that the backup servers are long gone after Merchantsoft got raided.
[408:39.01]You represent the first major breakthrough we've had towards preserving a piece of history that would otherwise be lost.
[408:44.43]Please check out the lost and found page.
[408:47.64]on our intranet and help us track down a few of those things there.
[408:52.82]Enforcer headband units had an entire gigabyte of internal disk space.
[408:56.19]Our best guess is that Enforcer units doubled as many backup servers
[409:00.92]which conveniently wasn't told to the unpaid moderators who might have scrapped them for parts.
[409:06.96]We coded a little program to help you help us extract the data accessible in your headband and upload it to us.
[409:13.75]Download and install the attached program to get started.
[409:18.03]We're all really excited to see what you dig back up.
[409:20.99]Check out the zone we set up if you want to learn about your fellow HAP members.
[409:25.45]Okay, so here's the program.
[409:26.91]Downloading have installed.
[409:41.63]Damn it.
[409:43.99]I'm going to make sure I don't laugh again.
[409:55.77]Fucking stupid.
[409:59.80]Yeah, but this is still on the desktop.
[410:06.22]What the hell?
[410:08.34]Hover over an archive page for details.
[410:15.07]What in the name of God is this?
[410:21.23]Team strategy email.
[410:30.30]First of all, I wish to warm welcome to our newest member is Jerma!
[410:33.36]We couldn't be happier to have you.
[410:35.68]Hypnospace archive needs more outside attention if it's going to survive.
[410:38.40]To put it plainly, we need to attract donors.
[410:41.21]My own social reach can only go so far.
[410:43.71]The kids who read my books don't remember forums, let alone Hypnospace.
[410:46.71]I found that music is actually one of the strongest stimulators of both memory and emotion.
[410:52.63]Our goal for the time being is to track down a few of the music-related things on our lost and found page.
[410:58.73]Okay.
[411:04.55]Open...
[411:07.07]Yeah, this is a really neat epilogue service.
[411:10.89]What?
[411:12.27]Okay, so we got... Hypnospace.
[411:15.58]Oh, that's... What is this one?
[411:16.92]Thank you for your time.
[411:18.88]We will notify you of future Hypnospace citizen feedback.
[411:22.72]Department surveys as they occur.
[411:23.96]Please close this page.
[411:30.03]Oh, damn.
[411:31.29]Hypnospace guides...
[411:39.32]Error.
[411:39.60]Okay, go back.
[411:42.67]Go back to the... go back to the hat.
[411:45.19]No, no, I want my... Username, Jazz Wilson Lopez.
[411:52.47]Zone the cafe.
[411:54.37]Come to Jazz's software review for high quality reviews of all his shows.

[413:47.16]With the lost and found.
[413:59.29]The intranet, yeah, but where the fuck do I go?

[415:02.09]No, that's not the right one.
[415:06.45]Can I turn the car around?
[415:11.66]No, that's not the right one.
[415:14.54]No, not the right one.
[415:30.79]Will I get data for doing this?
[415:32.35]It says Adrian, right?
[415:34.45]That's not it.
[415:37.15]That's not it.

[416:32.23]That's it.
[416:33.59]That's it right there.
[416:34.32]It has to be.
[416:34.86]Yeah, I got you.
[416:40.58]What was that?
[416:42.54]See the image?
[416:45.60]Oh, for the love of God.
[416:47.12]That wasn't it.
[416:50.85]Come on!
[416:52.87]How many?
[416:53.35]One, two... That's not right.
[416:55.33]One... Two splits?
[416:58.09]Is that correct?
[417:12.83]Got it.
[417:16.69]That's not it.
[417:20.35]How do I get out of this program?
[417:33.22]I gotta get out of here.
[417:36.91]That's it!
[417:38.15]Look at that!
[417:38.99]What's the difference?
[417:41.69]There is no difference Got him
[418:17.86]Dev.
[418:22.83]Alright.
[418:26.67]How is he that bad?
[418:29.27]Go back and you clip that and you tell me that that wasn't the exact image.
[418:31.95]That was just the top of my screen.
[418:35.30]You tell me that that's not the exact same car.
[418:44.86]You look at it.
[418:46.01]Tell me.
[418:49.30]You tell me.
[418:52.98]Alright, so, uh, let's open up the magic eye here.
[418:58.64]Let's see.
[419:01.54]I'm curious about something.
[419:05.24]No, don't get this out of here.
[419:08.30]You can take this picture off the desktop, fine!
[419:15.65]The last car you got was red?
[419:20.29]I ain't gonna take that bait.
[419:21.67]I'm not taking the bait.
[419:26.41]Okay, so.
[419:27.20]I'm looking for... I still have all this shit.
[419:38.34]So did I complete the game?
[419:40.20]Is this just the epilogue?
[419:50.31]You need to preserve, not delete.
[419:51.95]Alright, let's go.
[420:04.70]Open this up.
[420:09.88]Okay.
[420:11.80]Here's the network.
[420:12.94]Load new capture.
[420:13.88]We only have these ones, so let me just see how long this will take.
[420:17.84]Start up here.
[420:18.30]35% archived.
[420:22.65]So archived, unlisted, unarchived, archived public.
[420:26.25]These are unlisted pages.
[420:27.61]Let's just scroll through them.
[420:32.31]This can't be opened.
[420:33.17]That's fine.
[420:34.91]This one can't be opened.
[420:37.74]And it's broken here.
[420:50.19]Nice chowder, man.
[420:51.91]We already have his shit, though.
[420:53.05]6-8 hour game?
[420:58.39]Well, we're at 7 hours, so...
[421:19.34]It's probably not that much left.
[421:20.40]I just, like, I'm kind of not understanding exactly what it wants me to do.
[421:23.91]Just go page by page?
[421:25.57]I know it wants me to find that stuff, but... How do I get to that... The... Archive project!

[426:18.82]This is the capture from November 5th.
[426:20.42]How do I do this?
[426:21.70]It doesn't make any sense.
[426:25.76]Which one of these is... What date is this?
[426:28.82]What?
[426:37.50]Stop opening the map.
[426:38.26]It's the timeline for the homepage.
[426:44.80]Press next and previous on the pages.
[426:48.12]So let's see.
[426:48.58]Okay, so here we go.
[426:55.92]So... Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid.
[426:59.82]I can't do this.
[427:17.18]I'm so confused.
[427:20.14]This is November 5th, 1999.
[427:22.17]This is to go to November 26th.
[427:27.97]Oh my god.
[427:28.83]Okay, I'm here.
[427:32.69]I made it.
[427:51.28]I actually am beef-brained.
[427:58.05]Guys, I think I've opened the Wayback Machine like three times in my entire life.
[428:03.06]Now go forward in time.
[428:04.22]So you're talking about if I press next right here is what you're talking about.
[428:08.78]This button right here.
[428:09.88]That's not what I'm going to press.
[428:11.84]Click this button.
[428:19.27]So you go into a page and then you get the capture.
[428:24.57]So every website has a snapshot.
[428:30.91]I've never used something like this.
[428:41.16]I know what the Wayback Machine is, but I've never opened it.
[428:46.28]It wasn't even a scam, I win.
[428:51.88]Okay.
[428:53.12]Anyways.
[428:56.12]Let me just take my brain out and put it in a fucking blender for 30 minutes and put it back in.
[429:00.00]And then piss on it.
[429:00.74]Alright, here we go.
[429:01.52]Let's go.
[429:01.74]Alright, expedition is underway thanks to Jerma.
[429:05.88]You guys thought it was bullshit.
[429:12.36]I am in the planning stage of the expedition.
[429:13.82]I found a submarine on Acution Auction and I will use the funds from the rich benefactor to secure and repair it.
[429:22.75]Here's an image of the submarine.
[429:28.23]I cannot afford a crew at this time, so I'll have to go on this expedition all alone.
[429:32.67]I'm charting maps and looking for the most likely place of hiding treasures.
[429:37.08]If I find the treasures, I will bring a crew back to retrieve them and share it with my generous donators.
[429:42.66]Uh, he didn't make it.
[429:47.61]Uh, treasure found.
[429:48.49]Going back tomorrow.
[429:52.69]I have found treasure.
[429:53.65]I went on my first trip but could not get my camera to function.
[429:56.65]So no one will believe me.
[430:00.13]And help me get it.
[430:01.17]I'm gonna go out again tomorrow on a boat and dive for it myself.
[430:03.68]I will post an update soon.
[430:04.96]I'm so close.
[430:06.78]Here are the coordinates in case something happens to me.
[430:10.54]Uh... Can I like... Hello?
[430:17.47]Wasn't a scam.
[430:20.61]To 40 points, so I have... I think I got it, right?
[430:23.19]Let me write these down.
[430:34.58]Should I just write the coordinates down?
[430:36.78]Or does that just... Now I see them.
[430:39.46]Let's see, anything else?
[430:40.70]Nothing else.
[430:41.10]Go with the coordinates.
[430:48.46]Well, that's it, right?
[430:53.69]Because I should be able to go to those in real life.
[431:03.44]Yeah, check the lost and found.
[431:04.48]I'm assuming that it'll be back to normal there.
[431:13.26]Let's go back up.
[431:19.74]Oops.
[431:21.76]Okay.
[431:32.68]That's not it.
[431:38.86]The daughter and ex-wife of a Demetri Jack have contacted us requesting any information we could find on what may have happened to his son.
[431:44.64]Is there a...
[431:48.16]I wonder if there's a way I can like click on it or something?
[431:57.30]Upload it.
[431:58.27]Maybe, hold on.
[432:05.95]Use the map.
[432:08.53]I have to upload that to the archive page.
[432:10.37]Alright, well, let me go back to that.
[432:13.12]Let's go to his email.
[432:23.74]So this is... This is the December 31st snapshot.
[432:29.40]So, December 31st, 1999.
[432:30.20]Open the map.
[432:35.07]And it is... Which one of these is it?
[432:41.29]This page sucks.
[432:49.34]No, no, no.
[432:51.68]There it is.
[432:53.55]Help us fund our Submarine Expedition search tag Submarine Trip.
[432:56.83]Okay, so there it is.
[433:02.05]Load new capture.
[433:05.52]Oh, this is the one right here.
[433:08.70]Click it.
[433:09.30]I just did.
[433:14.46]I mean... Is there a way I can pull this?
[433:25.62]Right-click it or something?
[433:30.02]No, this is just the new snapshot.
[433:32.46]Is there a way I can take a picture of this or something?
[433:57.55]Okay.
[434:03.94]Report it.
[434:04.50]Alright, we'll go back to the lost and found.
[434:08.54]Okay.
[434:19.89]Not still there.
[434:27.69]Maybe the coordinates have to be used for something?
[434:36.79]Last seen mid-December 1999.
[434:38.01]That's this snapshot here.
[434:38.77]No, that's it.
[434:58.47]There's no way I can punch in coordinates somewhere, right?
[435:00.70]Like a map or something like that?
[435:02.66]No.
[435:07.22]Uh, let's see.
[435:19.69]Lost and found.
[435:20.33]Okay.
[435:21.67]All you need to do is view the page that these things exist on and they'll be sent to us in archive.
[435:26.45]So I think there's something wrong here.
[435:42.10]Refresh the page or view it in a different year.
[435:52.71]Maybe there are more pages to find?
[435:56.03]Yeah, I'll check his other account.
[435:57.85]Alright, let's go back to his email.
[436:08.32]Alright, what about here?
[436:11.24]202... 20202A.
[436:11.64]Okay.
[436:12.80]Let's try that.
[436:23.77]No, nothing.
[436:26.48]What about, like, here?
[436:29.36]Different snapshot.
[436:36.56]Nothing.
[436:42.09]There's a button behind the robot.
[436:45.33]Let's just reload in safe mode.
[436:48.05]You have to have the F. I didn't have to put it on before.
[436:49.69]No, you don't have to put the F on.
[437:00.82]Um...
[437:12.50]Maybe you have to do them in order.
[437:21.26]I'll try that.
[437:26.92]Alright, I'm gonna turn this off.
[437:28.62]Who cares about the super speed?
[437:29.62]Get it out of here.
[437:30.50]Disable it.
[437:31.22]Get out of here.
[437:31.70]Leave me alone.
[437:38.94]Okay.
[437:41.95]So, look for lost early song demo of now famous rapper.
[437:48.21]Kev J, a close friend of mine, remembers putting his music on Hypnospace when he was in his early 20s.
[437:55.02]Kev J. Some guy deleted him from a listing saying that his music wasn't real music.
[438:02.88]Okay, so Kev J, somebody deleted his listing.
[438:10.94]So we'll look up KevJ.
[438:16.02]Didn't use any search tags.
[438:20.50]Let's just see what we can find.
[438:25.77]No search, but maybe his name?
[438:36.29]Anything about KevJ?
[438:38.21]No.
[438:44.57]Didn't use any search tags.
[438:50.38]Where were the music reviews?
[438:51.74]There were music reviews on the dumpster.
[438:53.18]There were music reviews on that.
[438:54.88]Somebody had an entire website about music reviews.
[439:02.73]Where's the dumpster?
[439:04.83]Okay.
[439:06.59]Let's go to November 5th.
[439:12.19]Okay, World's Worst Showdown.
[439:14.23]The Dumpies.
[439:16.27]Hold on, let's see here.

[439:41.51]Alright, here we go.
[439:42.29]HSM is Merchantsoft's proprietary sample-based music format.
[439:45.47]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[439:49.65]KevJ.
[439:51.17]Did he make the pizza song?
[439:58.02]No.
[440:02.40]Nothing about KevJ there.
[440:07.07]Is there a goal to the game?
[440:08.33]I already sort of did the goal.
[440:11.94]We're just kind of cleaning up now.
[440:15.56]Okay, let's check this next date here.
[440:18.95]This list is too popular.
[440:20.29]The Freelans are amazing.
[440:21.59]I went to Cool Fest.

[440:59.57]Okay, let's go back, see if that did it, right?
[441:01.75]Do I have to do anything with these?
[441:26.29]That should be it, right?
[441:27.04]Yeah, you gotta do them in a row.
[441:28.86]No way!

[441:32.18]It's too late for that.
[441:59.04]Alright, this next one is Roddy's early test pet.
[442:04.70]Roddy made an odd-looking test pet early in November.
[442:07.26]Okay, so November 5th.
[442:09.98]That looked like that comic book floating eye.
[442:14.56]What is going on here?
[442:16.50]Private, I need your help.
[442:21.22]My name is Samantha, but you know me as Chelsea.

[443:07.03]So what's the name of this stupid thing?
[443:11.47]Important message received from MS underscore Samantha.
[443:14.27]Dude, what do you want?
[443:15.33]I still need your help.
[443:16.11]What do you think I'm doing?
[443:17.35]It's been 10 seconds.
[443:20.29]Once upon a time, I was an overworked employee at Merchantsoft.
[443:23.53]You can still see my picture on the team page.
[443:26.71]While we scrambled to put together the Hypno OS year 2000 update, Dylan Merchant worked on whatever he pleased, flist some weird big game project.
[443:37.55]I also caught him hanging around in some hacker group.
[443:40.41]Few hours before we went live with the update, a giant software package was uploaded from somewhere else in the building while everyone was gearing up for the Merchantsoft New Year's party.
[443:49.06]I believe this was a software patch added to the year 2000 update.
[443:52.14]Message received from MS underscore Samantha.
[443:55.14]You are just firing away at the keyboard.
[443:58.16]Inserting last minute changes that ultimately caused the Y2K mine crash.
[444:02.62]I believe Dylan Merchant is responsible for the resulting deaths.
[444:06.91]I believe Dylan knowingly allowed Tim, a fellow team member, you know him as Tim McGeddon, to be framed for this disaster and spend six years of his young life in prison.
[444:16.46]I need your help to prove it.
[444:18.16]Details incoming.
[444:20.93]I need you to find an access files that prove Merchantsoft knew the year 2000 update wasn't ready or Hypnospace knew that their technology could have harmful effects on its users.
[444:34.83]I do remember Dylan having an anxiety attack over a security breach right before Y2K, so maybe look underground.
[444:41.70]Attached to this email is an installer that will add a submit to SAM button on your HSPD enforcement toolbar.
[444:49.37]Using the SAM hammer will send whatever you select directly to me without alerting the rest of the HAP team.
[444:59.32]If you find this information, do you have any idea what will happen?
[445:02.41]If you find this, we can see justice done all without telling a single other soul.
[445:06.95]You ready?
[445:07.59]Let's do this.
[445:09.27]Downloading Sam Hammer.
[445:11.65]So we need to find out that Merchantsoft knew the year 2000 update wasn't ready or that knew that their technology could have harmful effects on its users.
[445:24.68]We're going to go to Tim's website.
[445:28.40]Alright, let's install this right now.
[445:31.01]Sam Hammer.
[445:31.61]Alright, we got Tim's, uh... We got... Don't I have, like, files on Tim already?
[445:44.77]Virus details.
[445:48.73]No.
[445:50.91]Where is it?
[445:52.25]Minecraft.
[445:52.85]Sure it is.
[445:58.39]There's no Minecraft, just a silly thing I did, blah blah blah.
[446:04.49]Here we go.
[446:06.31]I was using that chit-chat spying program to watch Merchantsoft's internal conversations.
[446:10.63]I think you were totally right about Hypnospace causing you migraines.
[446:13.21]They seem like they know it's bad for people that don't care.
[446:18.46]Alright.
[446:19.64]Well, let me send this to you.
[446:25.90]Uh, where's that program?
[446:26.96]Didn't I just...
[446:28.64]important message received from half underscore arty already uh a suspicious edition an auspicious I cannot overstate how proud I am to introduce my good friend and former full-time employer tableau roll please Dylan merchant is joining our team I'm sure you'll find him as valuable source of information and intriguing conversations I have over the past two decades uh oh well hello Dylan welcome
[447:00.15]Well, we're gonna get you.
[447:07.66]Is there a send to Sam button?
[447:09.26]Oh my god.
[447:15.02]Oh, thanks for that warm welcome, Artie.
[447:16.58]If any of you come across something that seems like it came from inside Merchantsoft, documents, images, WIP fragments, please contact me before going to the rest of the group.
[447:25.26]I can verify stuff, provide context.
[447:27.74]I'm an open book with a lot to offer.
[447:31.16]Excited to join this passionate team and make sure the full legacy of Hypnospace is preserved properly.
[447:35.52]Time for my D phone.
[447:39.78]Alright, let me, I need to sip this water.
[447:44.91]Alright.
[447:49.93]So, he did it.
[447:52.91]Did I not install this shit?
[447:55.17]Because I don't see a thing to upload to SAM.
[448:02.18]Trash half this garbage on my desktop.
[448:06.04]Just getting in the way.
[448:10.20]Oh my god.
[448:10.88]Can I please just go?
[448:12.78]What the fuck?
[448:15.46]Oh, no, nothing like that.
[448:16.28]Just checking how things are supposed to work for people like that internally and going forward.
[448:19.90]From Chelsea.
[448:26.12]Everybody's fucking emails.
[448:28.12]Ah, here we go.
[448:28.99]Okay.
[448:32.47]So, let's... Let's go here.
[448:45.08]I spelt that so wrong, it's okay.
[448:54.18]How am I spelling this?
[448:58.49]It's like T-I-T-1.
[449:04.07]Read the rest of the email.
[449:08.80]You don't have to worry about my authority being leapfrogged.
[449:11.68]Already cleared it with me before bringing Dylan on board.
[449:14.16]Actually, am I speaking to Dylan about Jerma?
[449:16.62]Joining and our new potential to access the Merchantsoft intranet seem to play a major part in his coming aboard.
[449:23.37]That said, if there's any issue at all with anything, say a new recruit, please let me know.
[449:27.97]Direct messages, smoke signals, anyone is free to talk to me through whatever they're comfortable with at any time.
[449:33.73]It's my job to ensure everyone here is safe and comfortable, not just funded.
[449:40.57]Okay, but I realize I already did this somewhat independently.
[449:44.34]Can we just bring folks into the core team anytime we want going forward?
[449:55.46]Okay.
[449:58.65]The email before that one.
[450:01.79]Look, it's just going to be a bunch of fucking company-to-company bullshit.
[450:07.03]Alright, we already did this one.
[450:11.36]Yeah, I read that already.
[450:12.36]Yeah, we've already seen all this.
[450:21.59]It's getting late.
[450:22.17]It's very late.
[450:24.45]But... I'm probably... I'm so close to the end.
[450:27.25]I just gotta scan a couple of fucking pictures and then we'll be done.
[450:33.29]Wait, what is happening?
[450:35.04]Continue?
[450:35.70]What do you mean, continue?
[450:37.92]Continue.
[450:49.36]Oh, I thought you were talking about the emails.
[450:51.28]It's been a long day.
[450:52.24]I thought you were talking about how I hit the continue button in the email.
[451:03.57]Alright.
[451:05.05]We're gonna go to Tim's first ever website.
[451:08.64]I'm just gonna type in Tim.
[451:19.80]Remove search terms Tim.
[451:27.78]I think you can just Sam Hammer the mind whatever 2000 on Tim's... Yeah, I thought you could.
[451:42.00]Nothing from Tim McGeddon here.
[451:44.92]Nothing.
[451:50.13]Was this scrubbed or something?
[451:58.02]I don't think I have Tim's ID.
[452:00.24]I have Tiffany's ID.
[452:06.27]Maybe I should look up that.
[452:14.59]Dylan deleted it all.
[452:19.05]right what about let me check let's go to seven one seven one zero five a anything from okay here's scary smolder boulder digital parasites my name is tiffany downloading my name is tiffany
[452:52.80]Scared.
[452:53.76]Ugh.
[452:53.92]Okay, let's see what these are.
[453:04.83]Oh, shit.
[453:05.39]This is fucking chat logs.
[453:09.62]Hey.
[453:10.42]Hi.
[453:11.26]Hey, Marshmella, everything good?
[453:12.96]I'm working on something new.
[453:13.82]I just found out how to edit Hypnospace zone pages.
[453:16.28]It's so easy, even my grandpa could do it.
[453:19.30]I'm not kidding.
[453:19.84]I took what you said seriously, and I'm making something positive where you help people.
[453:23.86]I mean, it still has my signature style and everything, but it isn't bad.
[453:27.92]I think you'll really like it.
[453:28.94]I don't care about getting into minx anymore.
[453:31.34]By the way, they're annoying.
[453:33.49]Cool.
[453:35.12]Okay, so get this.
[453:36.16]What if there is like a year 2000 crash?
[453:39.16]Ah, everything's on fire.
[453:40.48]But then you get to be the hero of it and stop it.
[453:42.15]We could even pretend you hacked me or something to stop it.
[453:45.63]I mean, I'm already the villain, right?
[453:50.61]And you don't want people to think you're involved in illegal stuff.
[453:55.08]This way you can be the hero.
[453:56.44]Also, I promise I won't use any more bright flashing colors because I know you have epilepsy issues.
[454:01.69]Anyway, let me know what you think.
[454:04.17]Ah, well, just don't go overboard.
[454:06.91]ICBI, you're cool with it.
[454:08.45]Yes, our son says, mama, I'm so glad you've come around.
[454:11.33]He, he, he, he, he, just kidding.
[454:15.15]Okay, what the hell?
[454:17.89]Alright, why would you save this?
[454:19.66]Okay, I guess maybe for proof.
[454:23.10]Here's my name is Tiffany.
[454:28.16]explore virtual mall by clicking spots on a bird's eye view map you can encounter scaries randomly by clicking on the various section now you probably see this this is just going to be a scary between me and Linda sorry also I will absolutely not answer any more messages if you call me that name I've told you I don't like it already okay interesting
[455:02.40]So Tiffany only has chat logs there.
[455:08.24]The question is, I need the teen site back.
[455:19.61]Fuck, I got to go back to like Teen Topia, whatever the hell it's called.
[455:30.79]There's no way she has anything here still.
[455:36.99]No, nothing.
[455:40.87]Can I report?
[455:44.43]Maybe.
[455:46.19]That's probably a good idea.
[455:47.09]Let's just go back to her little site here.
[455:57.15]Does that give you any info?
[456:07.75]I spelled Timageddon wrong?
[456:09.13]Oh, fuck, I did.
[456:24.13]Alright, Timageddon.
[456:26.45]Beyond Twilight, Timageddon.
[456:27.75]No, this is just his website.
[456:42.65]I mean, I could go to his weird website.
[456:44.51]Oh, can I?
[456:52.19]No, this is just her website.
[456:53.86]I could get his ID.
[456:56.38]00928A.
[456:56.52]00928A.

[458:13.15]Tim mentioned reading the chat logs and hearing about how Hypno is bad.
[458:16.01]Maybe start there.
[458:19.80]Uh, yeah, that was... Where did I get those chats?
[458:23.78]Isn't that, this is it, right?
[458:25.46]Isn't mine crash.ht, isn't that...

[458:41.00]Hold on.
[459:11.82]Uh, can you please do something about these guys?
[459:14.30]They've been messaging me non-stop.
[459:15.66]I tried sending a message to Counselor Ronnie and HSPD a few days ago, but I haven't had a reply.
[459:20.84]Chitchat doesn't reply to me either.
[459:26.20]I'm Cory.
[459:26.60]Nice to meet you.
[459:27.14]How are you?
[459:27.90]Hey Tiff, what hobbies do you like?
[459:29.09]Looks like you're busy.
[459:29.67]That's okay.
[459:30.05]We can talk some other time.
[459:31.41]Hey, I was working on something.
[459:32.29]Nice to meet you.
[459:37.89]Glad you're back.
[459:38.49]So we're...
[459:40.64]You were working on something with Tim.
[459:42.30]He does art, right?
[459:43.68]Very impressive.
[459:44.34]You're a little crazy sometimes.
[459:48.25]Do you mean that Tim is crazy in the way of being dangerous or just crazy in a zany, funny way?
[459:53.97]He could be dangerous, just in a funny way.
[459:56.55]Okay, good.
[459:58.60]Well, you can never be too safe these days, which is why I've been doing karate every day with a master karate expert.
[460:06.59]You and Tim going out.
[460:08.13]Hello?
[460:09.59]VWL, no.
[460:11.96]Sorry about that, Tiff.
[460:12.86]So how are you doing?
[460:14.58]Must be busy again.
[460:16.20]So let you know people are chit-chatting.
[460:17.74]Know if you want to stop a conversation so they don't have to wait for a reply and be bored.
[460:21.12]Sorry if that sounded mean.
[460:21.96]I'm just bored.
[460:22.92]Hi, Tiff.
[460:23.26]I mean, this will all do respect, but did your parents teach you manners?
[460:26.90]I'm not being mean.
[460:27.62]Just curious.
[460:28.26]Jesus.
[460:33.74]Is this Zane?
[460:36.62]Hey, hi, hello, hi, what's up?
[460:38.70]Cool, hi, are you a virgin?
[460:40.32]Hello, I bet you are.
[460:41.20]I know you're thinking about me.
[460:42.16]Excuse me?
[460:43.38]I'm naked, are you?
[460:44.28]What's up?
[460:44.78]Never mind, you're ugly.
[460:45.94]Suck it.
[460:46.34]What the fuck?
[460:57.51]Okay.
[461:02.65]Um... Fuck.
[461:12.71]Do I have Dylan's code?
[461:19.75]I can get it from his website, right?

[462:36.35]Headache, migraine...
[462:40.50]Did I spell migraine right?
[462:45.15]Maybe minx?
[462:45.75]Let's try it.
[462:46.23]I never got the password for this shit.
[463:06.74]Enter minx here.
[463:14.08]I don't know what the password is.
[463:19.98]Beef brain?
[463:24.71]No.
[463:34.47]Um, so the Minx website.
[463:36.57]Let me just hold on a second here.
[463:37.69]Does this change at all over the years?
[463:39.05]No.
[463:44.57]And doesn't have... I need that website that Tim made.
[463:54.90]What was that website?
[463:56.84]Damn it.
[464:02.41]He had a couple of those websites.
[464:09.81]No, what the hell was it?
[464:11.73]Here it is.
[464:19.97]Okay, here we go.
[464:24.07]Digital parasites.
[464:25.49]Read the sad tales.
[464:26.45]Alright.
[464:27.95]Enter the mind of Tim McGeddon.
[464:31.09]Here it is.
[464:35.34]The only good community in the Hypnospace.
[464:40.32]Okay, true tranquility.
[464:42.00]Let's wait for now.
[464:46.69]In hell.
[464:50.46]Is it egg?
[464:54.18]Pull this up.
[464:54.66]Let's try the next date.
[464:57.18]Thanksgiving Password Feast!
[465:00.10]What else?
[465:02.58]Thanksgiving Password Feast.
[465:04.98]Cracked programs, hacks, art, viruses, and assorted mischief.
[465:21.29]A hacker group who should let old Tim hang out with them before more of their passwords get leaked.
[465:30.39]Okay.
[465:32.13]It's probably on here.
[465:36.38]Here we go.
[465:37.88]Son of Tim here.
[465:38.48]My father spent two weeks collecting these passwords for you ungrateful imbeciles.
[465:42.14]Be thankful.
[465:43.63]P.S.
[465:43.93]My dad's also preparing a little Christmas surprise.
[465:47.06]Underground Hacker Board.
[465:48.48]Dear Minx, let me post and I won't leak your passwords again.
[465:53.82]Formatting note.
[465:54.50]Username.
[465:55.24]Password.
[465:56.48]They will change these quickly.
[465:57.72]Try them all.
[466:00.43]Here we go.
[466:03.09]So this is... How am I going to do this?
[466:08.55]Page 2.
[466:09.05]Chit Chat for HypnoOS.
[466:13.18]Zane.
[466:15.24]All their passwords.
[466:17.00]Moozy Man.
[466:17.88]Dink Dinkerson.
[466:18.82]Real Chowder Man.
[466:19.86]Adrian Merchant.
[466:23.40]Adrian Merchant!
[466:25.10]Really?
[466:28.65]Just pin this window?
[466:29.71]Okay.
[466:32.67]Let's try it.
[466:35.09]I can go get Chit Chat now, can't I?
[466:44.45]Because I'm not an employee anymore.
[466:48.65]That's probably going to be the smoking gun.
[466:53.89]Alright.
[466:56.04]Let's close this.
[466:57.54]This window is pinned.
[467:01.64]Get this back up here.
[467:04.43]Let's try these passwords.
[467:07.75]Alright, let's go with
[467:10.17]don't be that's not the first one we're gonna go right in the middle jez zero don't care abc one two three got it I think that I'm in right
[467:43.32]What the fuck is all this?
[467:52.38]Safe mode activated.
[467:56.15]Okay.
[467:57.93]Here we go.
[468:01.47]Tim and Minx, I kind of like the guy.
[468:05.93]Safe mode activated.
[468:07.89]He's got style, he can code, he's sick of Merchantsoft's utter incompetence, let's give the guy a chance.
[468:13.46]I mean, Dylan is here, so why not?
[468:16.43]Also, I'm sick of having to remind everyone to reset their passwords.
[468:21.17]Hell no, he's like 13.
[468:23.80]He has skills for a teenager.
[468:26.77]There he is.
[468:27.91]But I wouldn't trust him not to share too much.
[468:30.23]We wouldn't last another week if our lame interns found out.
[468:34.75]Seriously, there's no we.
[468:36.33]You're the one who shouldn't be here, rich boy.
[468:38.09]Go back to working on your bad car game.
[468:43.13]We're gonna get it.
[468:43.65]Oh, shit.
[468:51.42]Safe mode activated.
[468:55.68]Shit was in December, too.
[468:58.94]No, it wasn't.
[468:59.78]Alright, so... Go back.
[469:06.54]Here we go.
[469:07.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[469:08.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[469:09.64]Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[469:11.02]There's more here.
[469:12.30]There's no Wii.
[469:14.12]Go play your stupid car game, and then... He's... He's obviously a big fan of your stuff.
[469:23.34]but he's just doing it for attention.
[469:24.86]There's no meaning.
[469:27.24]Almost all of his junk is to show off for that Tiff chick.
[469:30.59]It's a high school mentality.
[469:32.05]Half of his greasy pimple friends would be in minx in no time if you invite him, so no.
[469:40.51]No meaning is an interesting critique from the dude who runs the dumpster.
[469:44.93]Also, did you see what he did to those guys in Teentopia?
[469:48.23]That's just as if I've ever seen it.
[469:49.63]Small scale, sure, but effective.
[469:53.01]Okay, you guys were right.
[469:54.01]Tim just launched a year 2000 mine crash attack code.
[469:59.19]More a game than an attack, really, on Hypnospace tonight, and it's entirely meaningless.
[470:03.85]It's completely overshadowing my leak.
[470:07.31]And people really need to see this.
[470:09.34]I wish he'd stop it with the theatrics because this could hurt people.
[470:12.78]If anything happens to my leak, I'm putting a backup on my island in SCDFL.
[470:23.13]SCDFL, that's Freelance.
[470:29.96]So that's Reckoning Inc.
[470:31.50]with a backup in Freelance SCD.
[470:36.02]Hold on, we're not leaving yet, not yet.
[470:38.59]Because there's more.
[470:39.79]There's a couple other threads here.
[470:44.19]Stop using Hypnospace right now, look inside.
[470:50.49]Safe mode activated.
[470:51.61]Here we go.
[470:52.91]Oh, here we go.
[470:54.95]Don't use Cyberworlds either.
[470:56.53]I won't post it here since the chances are too high that Dylan can find a way to see this.
[471:01.65]But if you have second sight, search this tag, Revelation.
[471:06.24]Putting a backup copy on my island, same one as the dream tools in Gil's dumb area.
[471:12.68]No one goes there anymore because merchants have deleted half of their stuff by accident.
[471:16.91]Won't be using my headband again.
[471:19.05]You know where to find me outside of here.
[471:21.31]P.S.
[471:22.33]Dylan is out of minx again as of right now.
[471:24.61]Some of these screens are very incriminating and I can't risk him knowing what we know.
[471:28.77]I think this is...
[471:37.54]What the hell?
[471:39.50]I can't do the hammer?
[471:40.60]Why?
[471:41.38]Safe mode?
[471:42.04]Safe mode activated.
[471:50.03]Alright, so we gotta go get the leak.
[471:52.23]We're almost there.
[471:53.03]We're so close.
[471:57.11]You can't ban the pest.
[471:59.80]So... If you have Second Sight, search...
[472:09.18]Greater than Revelation.
[472:13.11]Okay.
[472:13.93]Putting a backup copy on the island.
[472:16.51]Same one as the Dream Tools, so we gotta go to Freelance.
[472:20.73]Alright, so let's... First... Where was I first?
[472:23.77]Let me go back.
[472:29.03]Where is Dylan?
[472:30.83]Guys, please give us a break on New Year's Eve.
[472:33.31]Hold on, let's go... Fuck, there's so much data!
[472:42.12]safe mode activated beef brain worked you're welcome what's next for what safe mode activated alright here we go beef brain worked you're welcome what's next for jezzo I've still got some fresh counselor ronnie stuff coming but that's getting old and I think going too far with that maybe getting into some trouble open-eyed is fun because we blend in so well there any ideas maybe something with bible guy or psychedelic hippie drug guy
[473:10.20]Counselor Ronnie?
[473:10.78]Oh god, I didn't even catch on to that.
[473:12.24]Well, whatever.
[473:13.08]Just don't get too wild.
[473:14.23]Beef brain has already been expensive, what with our health experts and all.
[473:18.87]Still, it makes me laugh knowing how much Adrian would hate this.
[473:28.24]Okay.
[473:29.02]Hey, ladies, new outlaw testing.
[473:32.22]Safe mode activated.
[473:34.11]How about it?
[473:34.53]I've got a new alpha, really more of a beta, with some sweet new stuff, and it's still playing with bots, but I'm getting online going in the next week.
[473:41.98]I'm interested, if only to see how unfathomably terrible your code is.
[473:46.68]Otherwise, I'd like to keep my headband from exploding.
[473:49.14]Thanks.
[473:49.58]I can't, like, click on that?
[473:54.58]New dumpster trash?
[473:56.28]I hate Hypnospace, but...
[473:58.76]Safe mode activated.
[474:00.10]Sometimes it is great.
[474:01.06]Coolfest99 was better than any of us could have hoped.
[474:04.18]Chowderman losing a leg in a helicopter crash.
[474:06.38]You can't make this stuff up.
[474:08.63]Also, watching Cool Punk implode because of lip syncing has been great, so Dylan, official statement.
[474:15.60]Yeah, this was a mess.
[474:16.54]The whole Cool Punk thing was stupid and we're about to do away with it.
[474:19.88]Adrian saw potential because of the Gray's Peak connection, but nah, there's no real movement except a few kids being weird online and Gray's Peak are done with us.
[474:28.28]There we go.
[474:29.22]He's like the master, the master debater here.
[474:32.17]it's interesting the cool punk is dead guy and father fungus have matching headband ids same person as far as I can tell he worked with freezer at some point or did music for him his fungus style music sounds similar also Dylan I thought you were the creature brother who didn't care about money what changed alright here we go I think we got all the info we need safe mode activated very cool alright here we go

[476:22.79]He only put the ability to... It's all here.
[476:28.25]Leaky Piping.
[476:30.58]Let's see what that does.
[476:32.66]And then go to the free lands.
[476:34.60]Leaky Piping.
[476:40.76]Merchantsoft's Leaky Piping.
[476:43.54]Oh dear.
[476:44.54]Interesting.
[477:00.18]leaky piping zero zero one the mystery of the deleted zones oh dear okay here comes the whole thing this edition of leaky piping Merchantsoft deletes five thriving Hypnospace communities because they're geeks and losers jump to file downloads oh boy this is it this is the we got it this is the end
[477:24.41]LeakyPipey1, the mystery of the deleted zones.
[477:27.55]This is Dylan and Adrian Merchant.
[477:30.07]Can we do something about the geeks you have been putting it off?
[477:33.85]Adrian, the geeks make up a third of our citizens and half of the zones in Hypnospace City menu.
[477:38.11]We can't just delete their pages.
[477:39.35]What do you want me to do?
[477:41.45]They are still everywhere.
[477:42.86]When new people come, the thing is, it's a geek club.
[477:46.54]Hypnospace is different because it's for mom and dad and grandma and kids, not for computer geeks.
[477:51.80]What the fuck is wrong with this person?
[477:54.41]So that email that I got was real.
[477:57.80]We have five zones for geek losers and not even one zone for sports.
[478:01.32]It's ridiculous, Dylan.
[478:03.94]Tell me something today.
[478:05.44]Hello?
[478:08.80]I'm back.
[478:09.38]One intern, Ralph some R kid, said to condense the geek zones into one big sci-fi cyber cog comic gaming zone, but make it seem like an exciting event.
[478:19.87]Probably not a good idea because of inevitable backlash.
[478:24.45]Can you move all their files to the clunker so we can put the stadium on speedy one so it run fast for the big Y2K event?
[478:33.22]Oh!
[478:35.38]Oh, you're going to have to come.
[478:36.18]You're going to have to look at this.
[478:38.38]You're going to have to look at this.
[478:46.12]Oh, yeah.
[478:49.18]Hey, Dylan, did you have anything to do with this Starport Castle Dreamville thing?
[478:53.23]This is from Roddy.
[478:56.20]Oh no, Roddy, I'm so sorry.
[478:57.32]We had a team of interns trying to solve a problem for us, and they chose to put a few zones together on their own server.
[479:02.96]And I totally forgot your pages were there.
[479:05.22]I should have watched them.
[479:07.42]It's okay, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time.
[479:09.87]Is it just my connection, or is my page loading slower?
[479:14.45]Probably just hasn't page... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[479:17.49]Mirrored text transcripts.
[479:23.18]Oh, damn.
[479:24.42]Peeping made possible by the spy tool.
[479:28.53]Jump to file down.
[479:29.43]Okay, download chat log screenshots.
[479:31.79]You should take these.
[479:32.57]Okay.
[479:32.83]Okay.
[479:43.85]You should take it all.
[479:45.61]Mirror down.
[479:46.35]What are these?
[479:47.07]Mirror down?
[479:47.57]Oh, these are just mirrors.
[479:48.55]And transcripts.
[479:48.99]Okay.
[479:49.15]Yeah, fucking take it all.
[480:17.02]Okay, got that one.
[480:19.84]Take this, take them all.
[480:21.12]Just read them all.
[480:27.75]Alright.
[480:28.63]So that's Leaky Piping 1.
[480:29.57]Let's go back.
[480:33.19]We still have other dates to look at too.
[480:34.79]Mystery of the Deleted Zones.
[480:46.60]Dylan's Bad Car Game.
[480:48.58]In this edition of Leaky Piping, Dylan Merchant's Bad Car Game.
[480:56.79]Hey, I'm working on knocking out bugs now.
[480:58.43]Just wanted to let you know that I'm testing Outlaw with a few enforcers tonight.
[481:01.61]I'd really like to get it in by the Y2K update.
[481:06.48]Okay, if you think you have time.
[481:07.96]Not being rude here, but I don't think we have time.
[481:10.96]We really need to address the bugs and only the bugs.
[481:14.80]Hmm.
[481:14.96]Hmm.
[481:17.80]Come on, Dylan.
[481:18.34]You know we can't finish that thing in time.
[481:20.12]It's cool, but it's not time yet.
[481:22.70]Samantha, mind your manners.
[481:23.74]Dylan is a whiz kid.
[481:25.82]I could finish it.
[481:26.72]It would be nice if more than one person at this damn company actually understood how huge this could be.
[481:31.78]I'll finish it myself if I have to.
[481:33.70]Do your boring daily grind drone work and I'll do this myself because I'm apparently the only person with creative vision here.
[481:41.49]Wow.
[481:43.07]I'm sorry for exploding.
[481:44.03]It's just that this has to happen.
[481:46.15]Outlaw will be released for the New Year's Day update.
[481:49.19]It's the only way Cyber Worlds won't crush us.
[481:52.56]Yes, it's ambitious, but I'm really just trying to keep us having a job here.
[481:57.54]Cyber Worlds has good graphics and games.
[482:00.46]It's true, Samantha.
[482:01.30]We need to get this on the balls.
[482:04.49]Fucking take it all.
[482:10.09]Look into all this shit.
[482:11.65]Take two of them.
[482:22.59]Okay.
[482:23.72]Give me one of these two.
[482:24.54]Give me both of them.
[482:25.58]Alright.
[482:26.88]That's Leaky Piping 2 done.
[482:28.30]So that's it here.
[482:28.74]Let's check any other dates.
[482:30.00]November 5th.
[482:30.72]That's okay.
[482:31.20]Safe mode.
[482:31.42]This is like a long time ago.
[482:32.46]Alright.
[482:32.68]What about December?
[482:51.11]There's December.
[482:52.91]Is there a third one?
[482:53.65]There is.
[482:54.39]There's more.
[482:54.93]Oh, shit.
[483:00.69]Leaky Piping 3.
[483:02.47]Nom.
[483:02.65]This sounds bad.
[483:04.05]Okay.
[483:04.79]Hey, Santa's here.
[483:06.43]My incredible...
[483:22.52]Helper Reckoning sent me these.
[483:24.28]New Year's Eve promises to be very interesting for Merchantsoft.
[483:28.36]This sounds bad.
[483:29.12]We should probably stop using Hypnospace now.
[483:32.20]Here we go.
[483:36.52]I'm not a medical expert, but if I'm reading it right, they're basically telling us that people aren't getting decent sleep while using Hypnospace.
[483:45.85]Where's three?
[483:46.33]Alright.
[483:54.40]Oh.
[483:56.48]Oh, fuck.
[483:58.58]Two?
[484:03.60]Three.
[484:05.52]Oh.
[484:07.68]Oh, right.
[484:09.95]And this is initially a brief exchange between Adrian and Artie.
[484:14.63]Artie, I need help.
[484:16.11]Namaste.
[484:17.65]Nam to you too.
[484:18.77]I feel torn apart.
[484:20.35]Gray's Peacolico is such a big client, but I think they're getting cold feet.
[484:23.62]Any guidance to bring them back?
[484:24.88]Cool Punk is a big, big mess.
[484:28.36]Ah, peace and be still, dear Adrian, for I already knew that this pain has been plaguing you.
[484:33.30]It filled your eyes as you spoke at the investor meeting this very morning.
[484:36.32]You're not centered, Adrian.
[484:40.35]your adrian are you still with me is your quiet corner ready yes I'm at the quiet corner in my mind that I'm in my comfy giraffe chair very good now chant slowly as we practiced on gum you know adrian we should do this alright this is who cares about this
[485:09.83]Just take the fucking screenshots.
[485:15.97]Yeah, why would you type that?
[485:17.61]I want this too.
[485:18.95]Take the fucking transcripts.
[485:21.14]I want you to have everything.
[485:21.86]Take this too.
[485:22.26]Okay.
[485:22.36]Send to the mirrors.
[485:22.82]People made fun of me for that.
[485:46.50]Yes, 300 emails.
[485:48.26]Alright, here's the final leak.
[485:50.88]And this is going to be the real evidence to put this guy away.
[485:54.47]For 100 fucking thousand life sentences.
[486:02.55]No, get out of here.
[486:06.02]This sounds bad.
[486:06.80]Here we go.
[486:07.24]Here comes the whole thing.
[486:08.06]Here comes the big one.
[486:10.29]Here we go.
[486:11.67]I'm not a medical expert, but people are not getting decent sleep while using Hypnospace.
[486:17.11]Lazy bums who stay up late watching TV don't get good sleep, so what's your damn point?
[486:21.33]In Hypnospace they can talk to people and learn, which helps brains a lot.
[486:27.57]not my point the doc said that look don't worry about it if people are tired after sleep time just get on fewer nights per week people are responsible for their own choices too much ice cream will kill you but no one does studies on that yeah Hypnospace is like ice cream it's good it's we who don't get sleep with these long streams this I know we're late we're late again very late at night
[486:58.66]I mean, he's beef braining us along with himself.
[487:01.94]It's alright.
[487:05.67]Yeah, Hypnospace is like ice cream.
[487:06.81]It's good.
[487:07.19]It's fine.
[487:07.75]Also, it's our study.
[487:09.29]It was privately commissioned by us, so it can just stay private.
[487:12.91]The new PR guy suggested it as a way to deal with the beef brain rumors.
[487:17.86]We'll find some other way.
[487:18.92]Not a big deal.
[487:20.68]Good.
[487:21.12]The report said that beef brain is fake, right?
[487:23.56]That would be bad for PR if it was real, and people's brains did that.
[487:27.77]Yuck, not good for the evening news.
[487:30.47]I'm reading the AFSCART.
[487:31.69]It's lots of big words.
[487:33.35]I'm guessing you're still trying to get Outlaw out in the 2000 update.
[487:38.08]I don't mind this HSPD stuff, but it wasn't the job I was hired to do.
[487:42.12]As a matter of fact, we're uploading a press preview demo now as long as the team puts in the hours.
[487:48.29]It'll be there by 2000 for sure.
[487:49.98]Surprised?
[487:51.42]Yes, but more skeptical than surprised, Dylan, I'm begging you, please pause the game right now and get more people on stability.
[487:57.02]I just ran the update last week and it gave me the worst headache of my life.
[488:00.62]Literally, this can seriously hurt people.
[488:02.80]Send it all!
[488:19.85]Now you're fucked.
[488:20.79]Now you're fucked.
[488:21.75]Now you're fucked.
[488:22.81]Now you're fucked.
[488:25.49]Alright.
[488:29.35]Now we gotta go find the last thing.
[488:52.95]That's all the leaks.
[488:57.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[488:58.10]There's another thing here.
[488:59.18]Hold on.
[489:02.38]HS Toolkit now in Freelance and then Second Sight 3x3.
[489:06.16]That was the program.
[489:08.46]So the toolkit is in Freelance.
[489:11.15]So let's go to the Freelance.
[489:12.95]What do you say?
[489:13.53]Uh-oh!
[489:13.65]Dear God.
[489:20.64]Dear God, Jerma, you just found the jackpot.
[489:22.72]These conversations are painful to relive.
[489:25.13]Thank the stars we never followed through on banning Tim.
[489:28.95]Oh, on banning Tim.
[489:30.63]If you can find anything else, especially concrete medical evidence, send it to me.
[489:36.33]There has to be something floating around out there.
[489:38.13]In the meantime, I'm going to start putting this information together for the authorities.
[489:45.12]Alright, let's go get the last piece of the puzzle.
[489:47.05]I can go to bed.
[489:49.53]You can go to bed too.
[489:51.61]So we're looking for the Freelance.
[490:00.50]Freelance 5E.
[490:03.80]Now.
[490:05.50]What the heck did that thing say?
[490:07.24]Is it someplace where they said they didn't go?
[490:10.08]Some dump somewhere?
[490:11.07]Some, like, shitty... Where?
[490:38.77]Hey there, Jerma.
[490:40.03]I noticed you were racking up violations on some user.
[490:43.71]You do know there are other ways to get HypnoCoin, right?
[490:48.51]Anyway, just thought it was amusing.
[490:50.65]It's funny that our violation reporting system works without our servers online, but hey, just goes to show how good I am at coding.
[490:58.36]Also, your name sounds so familiar.
[491:00.36]Did we used chitchat?
[491:16.28]Wait a minute.
[491:21.76]Samantha is Dylan.
[491:22.46]They're the same fucking person.
[491:30.41]I'm sending all the evidence to Samantha.
[491:34.29]And then he's gonna know where it is and he's gonna get rid of it.
[491:44.28]Look at this picture.
[491:58.75]Okay.
[492:00.67]I'm going!
[492:05.19]Castle.
[492:06.03]Is it the castle?
[492:08.59]Where was I supposed to go?
[492:09.39]An island.
[492:15.76]An island!
[492:29.66]How many drugs are you on?
[492:33.40]Very creative.
[492:33.86]You need to remove the animation of yourself from this plot.
[492:36.70]Also, please remake your page because NetSettler doesn't explode into this anymore.
[492:39.88]Do you think this is a joke?
[492:42.54]You have one last change to remake your... Wait a minute.
[492:47.88]What the fuck is going on here?
[493:02.87]Kevin, the free lines work because people play by the rules.
[493:05.19]No!
[493:57.08]He finished the song!
[494:26.96]What does it say?
[494:28.48]Welcome to Accelerator Island.
[494:30.96]Merchantsoft clinical leak backup.
[494:47.86]BINGO!
[494:56.43]Excuse me, this changes everything.
[495:01.89]The final reckoning, act one, Merchantsoft commissions Hypnospace headband clinical study to silence beef brain rumors.
[495:12.43]Merchantsoft isn't happy with the findings and buries them, instead commissioning paid tests by independent experts

[496:13.69]Recently, a little research has been conducted on this new range of products.
[496:19.51]The study aims to examine medical mumbo-jumbo.
[496:24.47]The mean time spent in REM sleep during the nights without the Hypnospace headband was 22.9%, plus or minus 5%, similar to data found in literature.
[496:35.94]During the nights when the patients used the Hypnospace headband, time spent in REM sleep increased significantly to 49%.
[496:44.57]indicating poor sleep quality in those nights.
[496:47.59]Almost all patients experienced an increase in REM sleep when using the Hypnospace headband, 16 significantly so.
[496:56.17]Subjects reported average to good sleep quality during the nights without the Hypnospace headband.
[497:04.29]Nighttime use of Hypnospace increases REM sleep and decreases both objective and subjective quality of sleep.
[497:10.17]Daytime fatigue increased after using the Hypnospace.
[497:14.16]Headbands in most patients.
[497:15.40]Long-term prospective studies are necessary to further determine effects of continued hypnose-based use.
[497:22.93]Until then, we recommend discontinuing or severely limiting the use of this product.
[497:29.25]And this conflict of study was funded by Merchantsoft Incorporated.
[497:38.14]Brain activity.
[497:38.84]Look at this.
[497:39.66]Look at all these seismographs.
[497:41.82]Look at how fucked up you are when you do this.
[497:44.40]Let's check this one.
[497:46.04]This is like a triple earthquake here.
[497:52.97]Game over.
[497:54.67]Let's send it.
[497:55.71]And watch the fireworks.
[498:03.09]Here you go.
[498:11.28]This is the real one.
[498:12.68]I don't need this anymore.
[498:13.52]Is there anything else?
[498:28.73]External mirror download.

[499:25.58]You got it.

[500:00.86]What?
[500:07.06]Hello, Samantha.
[500:08.63]Switch to the HAP intranet capture before viewing this.
[500:12.51]Pretty soon you'll figure out, like I did, that Chelsea is actually Samantha, a former employee of Merchantsoft.
[500:18.75]Working with Jerma, she's attempting to compile evidence that proves that Merchantsoft is guilty of several crimes, one of which is knowledge of the inherent dangers associated with sleep time computing.
[500:31.04]Whether she found and submitted these files or not, the truth of this allegation is simple.
[500:35.20]I am responsible for the Y2K mine crash.
[500:38.23]Attached, you'll find a link to a confession of sorts.
[500:41.07]Sorry if this letter sounds a bit formal.
[500:42.87]I've been waiting to write one like it for a while, dreading it, actually.
[500:46.39]However, I'm not scared anymore.
[500:48.50]I know several incredible people that I previously did not.
[500:51.70]I finally experienced Hypnospace and the beauty its citizens brought me into the world for myself.
[500:56.40]I'm so, so sorry to you, Tim, more than almost, more than anyone.
[501:01.84]Send this to whoever you need to or want to.
[501:03.34]I'll be waiting.
[501:04.32]Send from my D-phone.
[501:09.16]The first thing you send me is a virus link?

[503:04.69]Dream Tools.
[503:12.16]What's this do?
[503:24.02]These tools are built on Merchandsoft's internal debug tools.

[514:44.10]Zane, file trees.
[514:45.72]Zane, rocks has ascended.
[514:50.87]Oh, these are the citizens that died.
[514:52.31]What do you mean they ascended?
[514:53.79]I'm gonna sneeze.
[514:55.09]I'm sorry!
[515:01.09]Why are you keeping them here?
[515:03.52]That just gave me a fucking headache again.
[515:04.94]God damn it.
[515:06.28]Whatever.
[515:08.84]No!
[515:11.46]Come here.
[515:14.40]So is this a way of him saying, I'm sorry?
[515:16.56]Is that what this is?
[515:20.76]Dark Twilight Tiff is now ascending.
[515:28.94]Somebody said, game sucks.
[515:33.47]No, it doesn't.
[515:40.84]That's, uh, Rod's anti-government.
[515:42.96]Yeah, these are, these are, there's only one or two more people.
[515:47.26]Burned Rubber has ascended.
[515:55.29]And... Uh, Ringleader Roddy has ascended.
[516:12.46]He spent 20 years making this.
[516:16.00]Yes, he did.
[516:17.04]Come here.
[516:18.16]Don't kill me.
[516:19.82]What is this?
[516:20.90]Is that Dylan?
[516:22.80]Dylan has ascended.
[516:25.42]Or maybe it's me.
[516:26.32]Was I dead before?
[516:42.96]I died, right?
[516:43.52]Okay, I get it.
[516:45.12]Let me explain.
[516:46.42]So I died, but I died inside of the program.
[516:49.22]And those people were able to contact me, my code brain, inside of the program.
[516:55.32]And after they got what they wanted, they were going to release me.
[517:07.23]Close the program.
[517:08.81]No!
[517:09.75]If I close the program, I'm going to redo the whole thing.
[517:25.41]Hey, look!
[517:32.83]We did it!
[517:33.27]It only took us about nine hours.
[517:41.09]What about in the other time periods?
[517:46.53]No.
[517:54.81]Oh, you did the music, too?
[517:55.71]That's cool.
[517:58.47]Hey, good job, Jay.
[518:00.45]Seven new files.
[518:01.19]I'll take a look at them.
[518:06.42]Read the file.
[518:07.06]I'll read them.
[518:08.08]I'll read them.
[518:12.90]This was really impressive.
[518:13.98]Yeah, it was.
[518:17.22]This is really just... You know, I would describe this game as neat.
[518:22.00]Just really neat.
[518:28.46]This is excellent work.
[518:38.95]This is a Kickstarter game?
[518:42.75]Wow.
[518:46.92]That's really neat, if it's a Kickstarter game.
[518:54.22]Now, that's a round of applause, because, honest to God...
[518:58.23]I don't know if any of the developers are still here, but, uh, this is one of like six Kickstarter games out of four thousand that either released or were actually fun.
[519:10.02]So, I mean, that's a pretty big deal.
[519:21.47]There's been like probably, maybe like twelve Kickstarter games.
[519:26.21]Yeah, that's my, there you go.
[519:27.83]That's my rating.
[519:29.07]One out of six out of 4,000.
[519:30.84]Oh, Jeremy, that's me.
[519:46.62]No, I'm kidding.
[519:48.13]Holy shit, this is a lot of people.
[519:52.25]First impressions, alright, so.
[519:55.85]I think I've had a little bit of time in the game so far.
[520:00.78]Look at all the people that worked on this!
[520:02.16]No, never mind, these are Kickstarter backers.
[520:03.84]Okay, I thought they had more developers than Anthem for a second.
[520:09.40]These are all Kickstarter contributors.
[520:19.53]That's a lot of backers.
[520:20.41]No, it was good.
[520:27.16]Huge game.
[520:29.60]Yeah, we had 1,500 developers.
[520:36.49]There's a real Chowder Man music video.
[520:38.23]I'm sure there is.
[520:40.37]Well, thank you to everybody that stuck around.
[520:42.77]I know we got late.
[520:46.75]And we moved deep into the night here.
[520:55.39]Alright, we got a couple of files to look at.
[520:56.83]I'm just curious what they are.
[520:59.80]I'm gonna read the fi- I'm gonna read- I'm gonna read the files.
[521:03.20]I'm gonna read the files.
[521:04.12]You think I'm just gonna not do it?
[521:08.04]I've gotta read the files!
[521:13.45]I'm go- I'm gonna read those files.
[521:16.57]Don't worry.
[521:17.07]I just wanna- Come on, this is important.
[521:19.09]We have to show the Kickstarter backers and the credits.
[521:21.19]These are the- These are the people that made the game.
[521:24.24]I didn't make this.
[521:28.52]Oh, I did!
[521:29.08]No, I did, right?
[521:30.44]Yep, okay.
[521:43.55]Here we are.
[521:45.59]And you can finish up this stuff if you really wanted to.
[521:50.13]There's still a handful of little things to do.
[521:52.39]I'm still not sure what happened here.
[521:56.96]Vinny is playing this right now.
[521:58.02]I think Vinny was playing it a couple days ago, wasn't he?
[522:04.61]I'm not sure he finished it.
[522:05.33]Maybe he's finishing it tonight.
[522:09.45]Alright, here we go.
[522:09.97]Download manager.
[522:10.97]New files.
[522:15.57]Okay, here we go.
[522:17.05]Mavis, I'm sorry.
[522:22.97]Rodney, your family came after us hard after the crash.
[522:26.07]They disgusted me.
[522:27.90]They smelled like body odor.
[522:30.10]Their clothes were stained, stretched out and dirty.
[522:32.12]They wore flip flops.
[522:34.42]They came all the way to San Francisco to our offices and we sent them away.
[522:38.36]I want you to know that if they're still around, I'm going to make it right.
[522:40.94]I'm sorry.
[522:41.56]This is from Ringleader Roddy.
[522:47.85]Roddy, you might not buy this, but I consider you my best friend at the end there.
[522:53.65]Who is this?
[522:54.31]Who's making these?
[522:58.19]My work consumed me and became me.
[522:59.93]People who weren't helping me build my masterpiece were invisible.
[523:03.59]Through all of it, you were always willing to come back and put up with my garbage.
[523:06.47]And God, I wish you hadn't.
[523:07.71]I'm sorry.
[523:08.19]This is Dylan?
[523:13.76]I hope you're with your wife now, Carl.
[523:15.18]I'm sorry.
[523:17.37]dark twilight tiff tiffany I took your future away from you your little worlds delighted others mine destroyed them I'm sorry and this next one's gonna I think gonna cause a little bit of a tear up action here I think this next one is gonna start the waterworks for a lot of us zane you could have become someone your mother was proud of I'm sorry zane
[523:56.39]It's too bad.
[524:02.56]That was a backhanded compliment.
[524:04.64]It's... Shh.
[524:06.34]Like, I got $1.
[524:07.04]What am I going to spend it on?
[524:12.08]Turns out I didn't even, like, need these.
[524:14.99]But even after you're done, there's still a bunch of pages that I didn't really see, that I skipped, skimmed through.
[524:25.16]could probably spend another there's at least probably another two or three hours of time at least to go through bwl burst out laughing right play janitor for the next six hours no no no no uh that was a lot of fun thanks for joining me I'll see you guys tomorrow
[524:53.26]Tomorrow, there's one of two options here.
[524:55.64]Either we're going to do Space Channel 5 or a new game that came out on Steam that's co-op.
[525:05.30]It's like a co-op story shooter called, like, was it Rico, I think it's called?
[525:11.81]Space Channel 5 is only, like, a couple hours long.
[525:15.87]So I probably, I need to put that somewhere where that is the beginning or the end of the stream.
[525:23.69]I'm actually really happy that I was able to stay on for this long.
[525:26.75]Because before I turned the stream on, I was sitting here thinking, maybe I'm not going to be able to stream for more than a couple hours, but I feel okay.
[525:36.66]So, late in the night, I know, thanks, there was still a shitload of people here, all the way into like 2 or 3 a.m.
[525:44.20]Eastern.
[525:46.48]So, appreciate it.
[525:49.40]I'm not going to do VR for a little while until I die.
[525:51.80]I'm not sure if anybody, how many of you guys were here at the beginning of the stream.
[525:55.91]But I had a massive, catastrophic, exorcist-like migraine a few days ago.
[526:04.15]And it shut me off for two straight days.
[526:06.98]It fucked me up bad.
[526:09.18]So I'm kind of taking it easy.
[526:15.42]I'm just happy I didn't have a problem streaming today.
[526:18.40]So that means I'll probably be fine tomorrow.
[526:22.71]Actual beef brain.
[526:23.87]Yeah.
[526:27.13]Imagine getting IRL beef brain and then playing this game on accident.
[526:32.79]What did I say?
[526:33.41]Blend up my brain and like piss on it or something?
[526:37.07]Something like that.
[526:37.65]Well, I'll see you tomorrow if you're coming.
[526:40.11]We're going to do the bits and the credits right at the end here.
[526:45.15]I got a stamp of approval on this game.
[526:46.86]This game was a lot of fun.
[526:53.26]And there were developers here, and that's really cool.
[526:58.09]You made an interesting piece here.
[527:00.41]So, nice work.
[527:03.15]Let's see, log off.
[527:05.23]How much in-game time was it?
[527:09.11]021A.
[527:09.17]Oh no, that's AM.
[527:17.03]Let's close that out.
[527:18.97]And hey, what do you know?
[527:19.97]Here comes the outro.
[527:21.07]I don't think we have too... These bits aren't going to take too long, I don't think.
[527:28.61]No.
[527:29.16]This should be maybe like 30 or 40 minutes.
[527:34.52]Alright, let's start.
[527:37.90]Thank you to Bake Me Home for the $2.50.
[527:39.44]Get some rest, you little man.
[527:40.82]I will.
[527:43.17]I'll be good to go for tomorrow, whatever it may be, the Space Channel or co-op.
[527:49.16]Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.
[527:50.42]By reading this message, your body agrees to be perfectly healthy for the next 300 years.
[527:53.52]Doctors hate me.
[527:55.32]I wish it were that easy.
[527:59.00]I wish it were that easy.
[528:00.99]But thank you.
[528:02.98]We've done some stuff like that before.
[528:04.18]We've sat there and watched random videos.
[528:05.26]Not as an entire stream, though.
[528:05.94]Probably not.
[528:06.30]Maybe.
[528:34.63]maybe maybe not for an entire stream I could do that for like an hour or so just old videos that maybe I'd want to re-watch or I haven't seen in a long time it's an interesting idea though you get carried away yeah you sit there for like six hours
[528:58.45]Star actually made a new video.
[528:59.47]If you don't know, Star made a new, basically, video.
[529:02.50]Just three years later.
[529:03.56]It's just like, bang, here's another one.
[529:09.16]It's pretty funny.
[529:13.70]It's pretty funny.
[529:14.88]You'd probably like it.
[529:18.04]Imagine not uploading the same year as Star.
[529:21.91]I don't have any plans for any videos.
[529:24.87]It was good.
[529:29.40]But thank you, 4e, for the three bucks, and not immediately.
[529:33.54]Hey, trust no one, thanks for the 250.
[529:34.79]Hey, Jerma, good.
[529:35.67]Uh, good you're in a better state now, but during my long ride through your archive streams, I stumbled upon several occasions of you saying something particular, but most of it turned out to be something different later.
[529:47.33]To be more precise, lies.
[529:49.79]Lots of lies.
[529:51.49]I've collected some examples just to reveal the truth to chat.
[529:54.53]I have to bring this message to the people.
[529:57.59]They must know.
[529:58.30]Justice must be served.
[529:59.72]Please don't be mad.
[530:00.62]God damn it.
[530:01.98]You're gonna pull out everything I've ever said?
[530:04.20]That wasn't true.
[530:04.82]This is gonna be embarrassing.
[530:07.20]Let me preface this video just by saying a couple things, okay?
[530:11.29]So, I just rifle off shit, right?
[530:15.39]And I'm trying my best.
[530:18.23]Sometimes it's hard to remember conversations you had six years ago.
[530:22.41]Remember, I've been broadcasting for three straight years.
[530:25.49]I had a YouTube channel for six years.
[530:27.46]I've been on camera fucking thousands of times.
[530:30.18]I've talked, I've said probably hundreds of millions of sentences.
[530:36.48]Expose me.
[530:37.06]Let's see it.
[530:38.18]I'm ready.
[530:40.85]God damn it.
[530:41.63]This is gonna be so embarrassing.
[530:43.11]You're gonna talk about the book?
[530:45.17]I know it.
[530:45.49]The book is gonna be the first thing.
[530:48.73]Weird flex.
[530:50.01]No, I'm just saying, like, it's hard to keep track sometimes of all the fucking things you say.
[530:55.72]It's gonna be about the book.
[530:57.20]Yep.
[530:58.16]What an embarrassment.
[531:03.42]Uh, here we go.
[531:07.87]Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985.
[531:11.47]You watch him, oh god.
[531:15.69]I'm a bad boy, guys.
[531:16.95]Can I play Stardew Valley again?
[531:21.71]Yeah.
[531:22.84]When multiplayer comes out for that game, I'm going to fucking play it.
[531:27.00]Am I gonna play Smash with Vinny?
[531:31.68]Fuck yeah, if he wants to.
[531:32.80]When Smash comes out, I'll play it with anybody.
[531:38.66]Actually, I am going to do an ASMR stream.
[531:40.84]I'm buying one of those Mr. Magoo ear headset things.
[531:43.92]You just wait.
[531:44.42]I swear to God, this is happening probably sooner than you think.
[531:46.46]Don't.
[531:46.88]You wait.
[531:47.61]You just wait.
[531:48.75]That shit's still happening.
[531:49.69]My first stream from Las Vegas.
[531:52.01]Ooh, it's going to be fun.
[531:53.47]I'm going to, like, pop open champagne and just drink it.
[531:56.25]Pop the bottles.
[531:56.99]We're in Vegas.
[532:01.10]I came in on a goddamn hot air balloon.
[532:03.48]This is good.
[532:06.40]Will I ever take my shirt off, though?
[532:08.72]I will not take my shirt off.
[532:09.94]I'm a local streamer who has gone insane and left his home stream.
[532:18.43]Oh, I gotta show this on camera, too.
[532:21.71]You got me.
[532:24.49]I don't do drugs.
[532:26.71]I am the danger.
[532:32.28]Woo!
[532:33.80]My blood turning a different color.
[532:36.87]I don't know what this one is.
[532:39.21]Tastes like trash.
[532:42.89]Wow, holy shit, Jerm is tiny.
[532:44.57]Oh, Jerm is so small.
[532:45.62]Yeah, let's see it.
[532:47.86]Do you want me to go get the tape measure and show you guys how fucking tall I really am?
[532:51.50]No, we're not doing that.
[532:55.97]I'm not big.
[532:56.95]I'm, like, fairly small, actually.
[533:00.17]Please give me more money.
[533:01.23]I'm going to do all these sponsorships and I'm going to shout out all these companies.
[533:04.14]I don't want to be some fucking poster boy.
[533:07.52]I don't want to be that guy.
[533:09.46]JetBlue?
[533:10.56]What a great airline that is, huh?
[533:12.42]Where's the best place to get an iced coffee?
[533:14.68]I happen to think that the JetBlue cart service has a fresh brewed coffee system in the back.
[533:22.97]I would put it up there with some of the best I've ever had.
[533:28.39]That's such bullshit.
[533:28.99]That's a personal endorsement.
[533:30.47]That's not a sponsorship.
[533:31.88]I didn't get paid to say it.
[533:33.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[533:39.54]I wanna see this again.
[533:42.96]Has a fresh brewed coffee system in the back.
[533:47.80]I would put it up there with some of the best I've ever had.
[533:53.84]Yeah, the camera fell over.
[533:59.72]Oh, I'm shit-faced on this stream.
[534:06.85]Not a huge hockey fan and not really a huge American football fan.
[534:10.81]But... But what?
[534:15.73]You thought I was gonna just absolutely... I'm not like that.
[534:30.03]I don't understand.
[534:30.75]What was it?
[534:46.18]What do you think?
[534:46.74]I'm insane?
[534:47.66]You think there's something wrong with me?
[534:49.72]Looks good.
[534:58.49]Let's see what the auto one is.
[535:03.09]Let's see what it is.
[535:09.04]Certified Judge Joel Brown gets cussed out.
[535:14.90]Guys, okay, let me be very, very clear here.
[535:21.67]No, listen to me.
[535:23.03]Listen to me.
[535:25.09]that algorithm makes no sense that is not pulling from my youtube account as you see looking I'm not even signed in this is just wherever youtube decides to take you didn't even mention the book oh my god it's a joke I know cookies
[535:55.27]Oh, that was fucking brilliant.
[535:59.85]That was just, that was fucking fantastic.
[536:03.34]Thank you for that video, trust no one, it was great.
[536:06.36]Tell it to the judge.
[536:11.18]Thank you again, trust no one.
[536:13.61]Let's make sure we get a link here.
[536:14.83]Because, wow, that was... That was good shit.
[536:25.76]That was Trust No One again with another fantastic video.
[536:32.01]Moving on here, we got Slice for $5.
[536:33.83]Jerma, $9.85.
[536:35.07]The Boomer Scout.
[536:35.91]Hope you're feeling better.
[536:36.71]I'm doing okay.
[536:40.84]I'm doing okay.
[536:42.54]Peek the mic for real time's sake.
[536:43.80]No.
[536:44.96]Keep in mind, those mics were all dog shit.
[536:48.35]That was like a blue snowball microphone that I bought specifically for that stream.
[536:53.53]I've not done that ever to this microphone.
[536:56.07]I never will.
[536:59.22]And I turned the volume down.
[537:00.44]It's alright.
[537:00.96]I don't even have to explain myself.
[537:02.32]I'm not a liar.
[537:07.58]Uh, Tar, Alakrin, thanks for the two bucks.
[537:09.42]Hey, Jerma, speaking of, uh, harassment, why do you go into streamers' chats when they are offline and spam jermaOld?
[537:15.95]Don't try to deny it.
[537:16.75]We know it was you.
[537:17.49]What are you talking about?
[537:19.29]What are you actually talking about?
[537:25.99]These are my most used emotes.
[537:28.63]As you can see, the first four are real.
[537:31.47]And the fifth one, jermaOld, I've seen a total of seven times in my chat.
[537:37.50]But for some reason, it's been used 15,687 times.
[537:42.69]Where?
[537:44.21]Weird.
[537:47.19]For some reason, Phil's birthday man has been used 6,900 times.
[537:51.53]pepeD has been used 11,000.
[537:53.55]I know that's fake.
[537:55.75]How has that email been used that many times?
[538:04.05]Top Twitch email?
[538:04.85]What website even is this?
[538:11.86]Here, here, look, look, look.
[538:15.39]It's been used like four... Jero's spam conspiracy.
[538:22.05]No, that emote is used almost as often as L-U-L?
[538:31.64]Are you kidding me?
[538:41.98]I really don't.
[538:47.92]Does that happen?
[538:49.02]That happens that often?
[538:50.81]People do that shit here so often?
[538:53.09]What about other channels?
[538:55.47]That's... I... Somebody's fucking gaming the system here.
[538:59.41]I don't know how that's possible.
[539:02.95]Okay, what's up?
[539:03.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... Alright, so it just happens 16 times.
[539:04.75]So...
[539:13.02]Is there a way to pull from this stream?
[539:22.07]You can see Vinny's chat a lot too.
[539:25.43]Well.
[539:31.23]Number one emote on Twitch.
[539:33.71]Make it global, Twitch.
[539:43.87]You have to go to the stream elements website.
[539:45.82]Ah, I don't want to do that shit.
[539:46.76]15,000.
[539:46.78]Is that per day?
[539:54.72]Well, fuck it.
[539:55.22]That's real.
[540:13.29]Fucking cool.
[540:15.05]One of my emotes is top 5.
[540:17.93]Top 1000 streamer, top 5 emote.
[540:20.11]I'll take it.
[540:21.01]Thank you.
[540:22.27]Thanks a lot.
[540:22.67]Appreciate it.
[540:30.44]Oh, it's only on that stream.
[540:35.26]Oh, never mind.
[540:37.02]So, one of you assholes is spamming that chat.
[540:40.71]Is what I'm taking from this.
[540:48.39]Wasn't me.
[540:49.11]Well, don't do that.
[540:58.85]It was me.
[540:59.73]Well, cut it out.
[541:04.27]It's like, I'm going to start getting phone calls from the school.
[541:11.34]Oh, he was spamming the emote in my classroom.
[541:13.76]And it's like, oh, god damn it.
[541:15.34]What did he do?
[541:16.40]Let me see.
[541:25.01]Yeah, you can do whatever you want with the emotes that you have paid for, but that's kind of fucking hilarious.
[541:32.22]I thought that was global.
[541:33.38]I was gonna say, how is it possible?
[541:36.40]But somebody just being, uh, crazy.
[541:44.75]But, uh, thanks for letting me know that that happened, I guess.
[541:47.73]Interesting.
[541:49.63]Interesting.
[541:50.21]Weird, but interesting.
[542:02.66]There was a single insane spike.
[542:05.56]Yeah, but let me just be clear about something.
[542:09.10]Don't, like, spam somebody's channel.
[542:12.52]You know?
[542:13.92]If you're gonna put an emote 15,000 times on somebody's channel, just being specifically to annoy the streamer, I mean, like, just come out and think about it, you know?
[542:29.29]I need a global boomer emote.
[542:34.98]don't think that's what happened I don't I'm not saying it is but all I need is like somebody coming being like hey dude like what the are you what what's with your community what the and I have to be like I mean I mean uh I needed to I mean I'm such a millennial holy that's first time I've ever seen that word in this chat
[543:01.11]But thank you, Tar Alacrin.
[543:02.83]Thank you, Future Gaming, for the $2.50.
[543:03.95]There's a guy who did a challenge to wear a VR headset for an entire week.
[543:07.53]Streamed for 165 hours.
[543:08.83]Yeah, we already saw it.
[543:12.05]We talked about it.
[543:13.23]I cannot believe somebody could be in there for that long.
[543:15.69]That's just... I hope he has a good eye doctor, because holy shit.
[543:19.93]That's a long time.
[543:27.02]I can't imagine sitting in 165 straight hours.
[543:34.81]I mean, that's got to be some Guinness Book of World Records shit.
[543:37.08]There has to be.
[543:38.10]Congratulations.

[547:49.52]You're not playing as Ulala.
[547:58.26]You just... I don't understand.
[548:03.34]That sounds a little stupid.
[548:05.06]I'm not going to lie.
[548:10.54]Okay.
[548:11.92]That has five.
[548:12.50]Good.
[548:16.10]Well, MJ won't be back.
[548:18.98]No, Michael Jackson is probably not back because Michael Jackson is dead.
[548:23.63]I don't think that he would have recorded.
[548:25.57]Is he in it?
[548:34.06]He would have had to record lines before 2009.
[548:38.91]He's been dead for 12 years.
[548:40.37]Yeah.
[548:41.23]I don't think Michael Jackson's going to be in this one.
[548:45.68]I'm very quiet.
[548:46.34]Yeah, I turned my mic down.
[548:47.04]Sorry.
[548:50.42]But anyways, if it comes out, I'm going to play it.
[548:53.58]I'm playing the other one.
[548:55.06]I played the other two.
[548:56.14]Well, technically.
[548:59.35]Breeze.
[548:59.75]Thanks for the $4, Breeze.
[549:03.55]Hey, Jerma, recently my two best friends left, and your streams have helped me cope with the lack of friendship.
[549:07.93]Thank you, jermaFireman, jermaHeart.
[549:11.03]Thank you.
[549:15.24]Thank you for the $4, and I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[549:19.88]Two best friends left.
[549:23.52]Well, don't worry, you'll make new friends.
[549:24.75]You're gonna make some new friends.
[549:30.45]Thank you for the $4.
[549:33.96]Still going at it?
[549:34.58]No, we're just closing up.
[549:36.78]We're just closing up shop here.
[549:40.80]Hold on, let me move this.
[549:42.00]Okay, there we go.
[549:47.51]But thank you, Breeze, for the $4.
[549:48.27]We also had Ferodian Weapon came in with $2.50.
[549:52.53]Sniper Elite VR announcement.
[549:55.77]Well, that's amazing.
[549:56.81]I can't wait to play that.
[549:58.77]This game is making me seriously nostalgic of the old days of the internet, when all I was worrying about was message boards for my favorite cartoons.
[550:06.19]The good old days.
[550:07.55]The good old days of the internet.
[550:15.19]And you would spend 64 minutes downloading a stone-cold stunner compilation.
[550:27.05]that was a minute and 45 seconds long.
[550:31.07]I remember those days.
[550:38.94]I used to queue up like 10 to 15 wrestling video downloads overnight.
[550:48.39]Wake up in the morning and before school, open them.
[550:53.67]Yeah, I remember when he did the tombstone cool click that one X that one out.
[551:01.27]Oh Mankind did the the Socko move nice It took like 6 to 12 hours To download like 20 to 30 videos now you can just stream Netflix.
[551:16.24]You guys don't know how you got it.
[551:18.08]Oh
[551:26.46]For me to watch like 20 minutes of content, it took like a week.
[551:33.95]God.
[551:35.73]But no, for real, thank you for writing Weapon.
[551:37.39]And that was a very good rendition of old websites.
[551:44.76]Hey, WildFox, thanks for the three bucks.
[551:46.22]Long time, no bits, old man.
[551:48.40]I've said it about a thousand times, but I really enjoy the fact that you regularly stream for something like six hours or more.
[551:54.04]And on that note, do you ever get sick of streaming or feel like you just don't want to play anything?
[551:58.26]Or do you feel like playing a certain game that you already streamed and don't because of it?
[552:03.21]Um... No... You gotta remember, I don't stream like a lot of other people stream.
[552:14.75]I stream four days a week, sometimes, you know, three or four days a week.
[552:21.34]I don't go hard every day.
[552:22.74]I don't have the kind of the same game or the same content that I like to do.
[552:27.00]So I have time to not be streaming, you know, and have a life outside of streaming and do other things and see other things and try to work on myself in the quotes.
[552:41.28]Right.
[552:43.50]But I don't ever feel like, oh, God, here we go.
[552:48.34]Get your face on.
[552:51.34]Fuck, I don't want to fucking be here.
[552:53.74]Hey, guys, what's up, man?
[552:55.04]Here we go.
[552:55.60]It is time for stream.
[552:57.56]Welcome, everybody.
[552:58.42]It's Seth Thursday.
[553:00.33]No.
[553:03.17]Because whenever I stream, it's when I want to.
[553:05.97]And that goes with, why did you get rid of the schedule?
[553:10.01]Because that's able to happen.
[553:16.87]But I had the same exact mindset when I did YouTube was I'm going to do it when I know I want to and when I know I can, when I know that I want to put myself forward and have a level of energy and know that I want to do something, have something I would like to do.
[553:32.13]And if I don't know what I'm going to do for a couple of days in a row and I'd spend some time trying to figure that out, then I'm not going to stream.
[553:40.80]It's been like that since YouTube.
[553:42.02]Sometimes I didn't make a video for like five or six straight days because it was like, whatever, let me figure out what I want to do.
[553:54.96]I am forever grateful that there are a shitload of people on the internet that are okay with that and think that that's interesting and like the stuff that's here.
[554:09.93]You know?
[554:14.49]I take that incredibly seriously.
[554:15.86]I take it very seriously.
[554:24.14]So that long-windedly maybe opened... Not opened.
[554:29.06]Maybe that closed that question for you, maybe.
[554:33.54]But long story short...
[554:36.30]When you see a stream turn on, it's because I wanted to turn it on.
[554:39.85]And if a stream does not turn on, it's because I didn't want to do it.
[554:45.43]For some reason.
[554:46.69]Either I wanted a break, I wanted a day off, I had something I wanted to do.
[554:49.63]I had other in real life shit I wanted to do.
[554:55.08]So every time you see the stream turn on, I want to fucking be here.
[554:59.28]It's part of the design.
[555:00.66]So, thank you so much for the incredibly, uh, wonderful continued support.
[555:05.50]And thanks for the three bucks.
[555:11.33]Thank you, Fraudian Weapon for the 250, Professor Helper here needs some help.
[555:14.65]Jerm IQ.
[555:20.41]What about the Mario Tennis Stream?
[555:22.43]Well, the Mario, uh, the Mar- listen.
[555:25.33]I didn't start with Mario Tennis, I started with that shooter.
[555:30.80]We transitioned to Mario Tennis because, you know, I wanted to be there initially for the first like six, you know, four to six hours.
[555:40.40]Then we had to move on to Mario Tennis, which I didn't like that one.
[555:47.22]So there's your answer.
[555:51.45]So what you're saying is, every stream you start that you want to be here, but maybe halfway through you say, I don't want to fucking be here.
[555:57.33]No, no, it's just, it's happened like twice.
[556:00.33]Mario Tennis and Skate 3.
[556:01.93]Those are the only two times I've ever been like, I, I gotta, I want to get out of here.
[556:07.12]That's it.
[556:07.82]I've streamed, I've turned this stream on like 767 times.
[556:11.06]Two out of 767?
[556:11.46]That is very, that's pretty good.
[556:23.63]about evil within two three times okay three three times out of 767 times that happened so alright you got your third what about karazin you got okay four yes that's true four out of 767.
[556:51.45]Look, I'm just going to round up for you.
[556:52.69]Let's just say it was 10 times.
[556:57.29]767 out of 10.
[556:57.85]I don't even know what percent.
[557:00.29]I can't even do that math because it's so small.
[557:08.34]You know.
[557:08.90]You guys understand.
[557:09.64]You got it.
[557:12.94]But thank you.
[557:13.42]I got a clutch for the 20 bucks.
[557:14.76]I got a clutch.
[557:15.26]Appreciate it.
[557:16.54]Please watch this video.
[557:17.38]It's like 13 seconds.
[557:18.24]You're going to hate it because this...
[557:22.19]I don't click links.
[557:28.12]I don't know what this is.
[557:39.81]Somebody kills a soldier.
[557:41.11]I don't know if I want to click that.
[557:43.57]This might be like a MonkaS scenario.
[557:47.01]But thank you.
[557:48.75]Thank you for the $20.30.
[557:49.23]Appreciate it.

[558:23.70]I didn't know.
[558:25.14]I had no idea what it looked like.
[558:26.50]And then I finally downloaded BTTV.
[558:30.93]Now I can see them all.
[558:33.85]I can see MonkaS.
[558:36.21]I can see Sour Please.
[558:38.33]And they're glorious.
[558:40.51]And he's regretted it ever since.

[559:28.59]But thank you.
[559:31.63]Also, The Cremator.
[559:32.81]Thanks for the $2.50, Cremator.
[559:37.15]Say... Uh... Hey, Jerma, so I made... So I made a flamethrower with a spray and lighter, and there's something I want to do with it.
[559:49.29]Uh... Well, first of all, this is a little extreme.
[560:00.60]I say don't do any of that shit.
[560:11.04]I would not play around with a spray and a lighter.
[560:15.04]You're gonna get fucking hurt.
[560:16.84]Don't do it.
[560:21.82]It's not fun.
[560:23.54]It's not cool.
[560:25.75]Don't play around with a lighter and a spray can.
[560:30.59]That is 100% advice.
[560:31.27]You can take that advice.
[560:40.91]thank you flamethrower by Elon Musk those things real thank you dork cube for the 250 uh sarinia is the girl of my dreams oh that was the archer right JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR five dollars thank you hey good stream jermaHeart the only thing that's missing is a good old-fashioned funny scream
[561:09.84]No, I can't scream.
[561:11.07]I'll give myself a fucking migraine.
[561:22.48]That's how you get a migraine.
[561:29.00]I don't want to see Minecraft VR.
[561:30.43]Why not?
[561:39.88]Store up power.
[561:42.26]Minecraft VR is beef brain.
[561:45.52]God.
[561:48.65]I think I'll be fine, though.
[561:50.65]I need to think about what I'm going to do with... I'm trying to think of a schedule here.
[561:57.91]Because VR is going to be... Let me see.
[562:06.70]VR is going to be interesting.
[562:09.00]Because I need to block out the whole room.
[562:12.40]I want to do like three or four more games.
[562:15.87]Let's see.
[562:16.59]When can I actually do this reliably?
[562:18.41]I'm going to probably play something else tomorrow.
[562:22.37]Or today, technically.
[562:24.33]Saturday.
[562:25.01]It's probably not going to happen until the end of next week.
[562:29.67]I'll do like another two or three days in a row of VR.
[562:33.44]This time next week.
[562:35.64]We're going to beef brain ourselves.
[562:39.45]But thank you, Dermalight, about Minecraft VR.
[562:43.61]I'll be there.
[562:45.27]Also, thank you, Unkind, for the 10 bucks.
[562:47.65]Prayers to those that lost their lives in the mass shooting at the mosques in New Zealand.
[562:51.91]It's incredibly upsetting to see people being brought into mindsets where they think that violence is the only way.
[562:56.80]Goes to show there are plenty of crazy ways.
[562:58.02]Wait, what happened?
[563:07.80]Jesus Christ.
[563:10.60]Oh, that's not, that's terrible.
[563:13.22]What?!
[563:16.16]Oh, man.
[563:20.53]40 people dead.
[563:23.81]Holy shit.
[563:29.57]That's fucking horrible.
[563:33.65]Did this just happen?
[563:34.93]This just happened.
[563:43.33]Well... That's not good.
[563:54.64]Yeah, I'm... I can't even... I can't even fucking look at this right now.
[564:00.56]It's terrible.
[564:02.30]That's fucking sad and horrible.
[564:04.60]But... Stay safe, everybody.
[564:08.14]Stay safe out there.
[564:12.60]That probably just happened, so... Yeah, I'm not even going to address it.
[564:21.08]But thank you for the $10, Unkind.
[564:22.86]And they say stay safe as well.
[564:24.26]Yeah, thank you.
[564:24.96]Alright, we're going to move on from that one.
[564:37.09]We're going to move on to E-Dragon.
[564:39.85]Thanks for $3, Unkind.
[564:42.42]I might regret finishing the stream in the morning, but I had a great time.
[564:45.24]Hope your migraine doesn't come back.
[564:46.56]I know how painful they can be.
[564:50.13]Yeah.
[564:51.83]They can be such a pain.
[564:54.21]It's been seriously so long since I've had one that was that bad as a couple nights ago.
[565:01.35]Kim was lying down next to me, and I was seriously rolling around being like...
[565:08.39]I was like, open the window.
[565:09.63]Open the window.
[565:09.99]We need to get some air in here.
[565:11.37]And she's like, okay, okay, okay.
[565:12.37]She opens the window and I'm like, okay.
[565:14.66]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[565:15.76]Alright, now close the window.
[565:16.72]It's a little too hot in here.
[565:17.58]And she's like, okay.
[565:18.24]And she closes the window.
[565:21.36]It was very bad.
[565:30.28]She took really good care of me, though.
[565:32.84]She's great.
[565:36.30]But, thank you, E-Dragon.
[565:39.84]And let's... Let's grab the credits while we're at it here.
[565:44.92]There were a lot of subs tonight.
[565:46.56]I haven't been around in a few days.
[565:48.64]Looks like a lot of people queued up their subs.
[565:52.25]So thank you, everybody, for sharing those.
[565:57.35]Let's get them rolling.
[566:01.51]Hey, look at that.
[566:02.31]Here they come.
[566:03.33]All the new subs, all the old subs, thanks a lot, everybody.
[566:06.23]We only have a couple more bits to do.
[566:10.59]This is from The Jewish Bro for $2.85.
[566:14.47]You should go to the doctor and get a CAT scan.
[566:17.10]Also, can you play Gravity Bone in 40 Flights of Lovin'?
[566:20.76]They're fun little short games.
[566:24.93]I think I've heard Gravity... Have I heard those words before?
[566:27.17]I feel like I have.
[566:30.80]But I have had a CAT scan before.
[566:33.14]I've had a scan of my brain.
[566:35.52]This was a long time ago, but I still had it when I had my first... I had a migraine like 10 or 11 years ago that put me in the ER.
[566:44.96]And I had a scan.
[566:45.98]It came back negative.
[566:48.67]So maybe I should do it again.
[566:49.71]I was given... Imitrex was the prescription I was put on when I needed to use it, but I didn't like using it because I didn't like how it made me feel.
[566:59.52]So I kind of just take a couple Advil when I get a migraine and just power through it.
[567:08.65]But I plan on, I have a colonoscopy coming up because I've had like digestive issues back again too recently.
[567:16.82]So I have a full colonoscopy plan.
[567:18.60]I'm probably going to do a full scan of my brain.
[567:20.84]I got to make, you know, I'm 30.
[567:21.90]I pushed over 30.
[567:24.47]It's time to... I gotta be a regular about getting, you know, appointments and scans and keeping up with my illnesses and shit.
[567:32.38]Recommend you do the same.
[567:33.46]Take care of yourselves, guys.
[567:34.42]Really.
[567:34.66]You get one body, take care of it.
[567:38.84]I'm going down the path of give me a full colonoscopy, let's get it done.
[567:50.49]I get two.
[567:52.49]No, you don't.
[567:55.14]But thank you, Jewish Bro.
[567:56.48]I have had it before.
[567:59.42]Hallooloo.
[568:00.24]Thanks for the $2.50.
[568:00.64]Appreciate it.
[568:02.72]Hey, Jerma.
[568:03.12]I heard that you weren't feeling well, and I drew a little get-well card of sorts.
[568:06.65]Hope you get back to feeling 100% soon and enjoy your time off with family.
[568:09.97]Thanks for all the laughs.
[568:10.81]Enjoy even on tough days.
[568:12.15]Thank you.
[568:12.83]That's incredibly nice.
[568:18.74]Thank you, Hallooloo.
[568:24.74]And some art.
[568:25.52]Let's see.
[568:28.84]No, this is just... This is so... This is wonderful.
[568:31.04]Thank you.
[568:33.17]Take a look.
[568:35.31]Get well soon.
[568:35.97]There's Shito.
[568:36.73]There's the J. This is great.
[568:48.46]So many people are so talented here.
[568:54.54]Just look at the videos, and the artwork, and the... It's... It's remarkable.
[569:05.87]I'm spoiled by all of you.
[569:09.11]Thank you.
[569:13.22]Shito looks adorable.
[569:15.08]Yes, Shito does.
[569:18.24]But thank you, Halaloo, again.
[569:21.82]Thank you Snooze and Cofter for the $2.50.
[569:22.96]Hey Jerma, kind of nice you're still streaming.
[569:25.30]It's 9am here and I got to go somewhere to sign stuff for my first job.
[569:29.28]I'm kind of nervous, not going to lie.
[569:31.52]I barely slept.
[569:32.78]Something about the commitment that gives me worries.
[569:34.44]Any stories from your first job?
[569:37.33]Here's the best thing about first jobs.
[569:39.63]Gives you a lot of good experience.
[569:43.67]When you go to work,
[569:46.36]For the first time.
[569:47.84]But first of all, yeah, congratulations.
[569:49.46]Hell yeah.
[569:50.20]Glad you got a first job.
[569:52.60]That's good.
[569:56.41]You learn a lot.
[569:58.63]And you'll take that wherever you go.
[570:03.29]So, the story of my first job ever.
[570:05.73]I don't know if I was particularly nervous as much as I was.
[570:11.43]I wanted to do as good of a job as I possibly could.
[570:17.48]as long as you like you don't want to overwork yourself though but just you know try to care about what you do people see it people can tell and if you don't if you don't like what you do and if you're not enjoying it anymore if it's something like you go to work you don't like it then try to transition to something else
[570:46.63]Deep lore.
[570:50.30]And it can be tough.
[570:52.80]I worked in... I did a lot of substitute teaching.
[570:56.80]I did a lot... I know people are gonna... I think that's a meme and it's a joke.
[571:02.05]That was... I think that's the only time I was really ever nervous.
[571:08.31]Because I was responsible on all the jobs I ever had.
[571:11.39]I was never responsible for other people.
[571:14.09]And then when I started substitute teaching, it was like... Okay, now I'm responsible for other people.
[571:21.64]Were you the cool... No, I was not the cool teacher.
[571:24.04]I've talked about a couple of stories.
[571:25.90]When I used to sub.
[571:30.78]Need more stories about being a teacher?
[571:32.18]I don't really have any.
[571:34.32]I was just handing out worksheets and making sure nobody did anything bad and, you know, answering questions.
[571:41.24]It really wasn't like, whoa, I got some school of rock.
[571:44.54]Oh, I turned into Jack Black and I got a guitar.
[571:46.78]No, I just kind of sat around and made sure people did their work.
[571:55.64]And making the teacher noise sometimes, yeah.
[572:01.97]But congratulations on your job, Snooze and Copter.
[572:05.74]Happy to hear it.
[572:06.82]You get done with it.
[572:07.26]You're gonna be just fine.
[572:08.76]You're gonna knock it out of the park.
[572:12.96]And then finally we had 250 from Lazy Luke and then 250 from Honey Chain.
[572:17.20]The thought of you in pain makes me sad.
[572:19.04]Hope everything works out for you.
[572:21.28]Also, I changed my mind.
[572:22.66]I do want to see Minecraft VR.
[572:26.84]Is Jerma way lame?
[572:28.02]Confirmed?
[572:30.24]Um, I don't know.
[572:31.30]I don't think so.
[572:32.75]I mean, if you think I'm lame, then...
[572:35.60]That's what you think?
[572:38.86]I can't tell you that.
[572:39.76]I can't tell you that I don't agree with you.
[572:41.94]Actually, no, I don't agree with you.
[572:43.24]But I can't tell you what you're saying to me.
[572:44.98]You know, just ban him.
[572:48.53]No, I'm kidding.
[572:49.23]Don't actually do that.
[572:58.71]That's it.
[572:59.19]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[573:03.27]We'll figure something out.
[573:07.17]Take care of yourselves.
[573:08.67]The thought of you in pain makes me sad.
[573:10.33]Look, we all go through shit, you know?
[573:14.43]Don't worry.
[573:16.64]I'm just fine.
[573:21.58]Just the shit that I am having problems with right now, and that's it.
[573:24.62]You just gotta deal with them.
[573:26.02]And try to figure out how to get through them.
[573:31.67]So thank you all so much.
[573:32.53]See you tomorrow.
[573:35.21]See you soon.
[573:37.25]Good night and good bye.
