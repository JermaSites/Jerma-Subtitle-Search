[00:10.80]It'll kill him.
[00:11.74]That's what brought me back to life that one time.
[00:13.82]When we both fell.
[00:16.10]Just the damage over time.
[00:17.78]Oh, boy.
[00:24.44]Oh, shit.
[00:24.72]Watch out.

[00:31.86]Oh, watch out.

[00:33.68]I'm going to take out the spitter.
[00:37.78]So the bird...
[00:40.24]It goes for one sweep, and then it runs away.
[00:43.78]Oh boy.
[00:45.08]Careful there.
[00:45.58]Where's the spitter?
[00:47.30]He's leaping around over here.
[00:48.37]Oh, that's a whelp.
[00:51.11]There he is.
[00:57.81]Oh, health!
[00:58.83]Right when we needed it.
[01:02.33]God, the melee that I have comes in so useful.
[01:07.32]There's more health over here for me, I mean.
[01:09.60]Anyone need help?
[01:11.50]Yeah, you do.
[01:11.98]Anyone need help?
[01:12.62]And I just took it.

[01:29.05]Do I have any extra skill points left over?
[01:33.49]You think you get one every level.
[01:34.61]Oh yeah, I have one remaining point.
[01:36.57]What am I doing?
[01:39.49]Um... Increase your resistance to damage after... That's nice.
[01:45.48]Increase damage to, um... After leaving the phase thing.
[01:52.02]What's this thing right here?
[01:53.76]These are the seeds we need.
[01:55.77]From those weird-ass plants, alright?

[02:50.35]I haven't seen any of these before.
[02:53.29]Yeah, we have.
[02:54.19]Earlier.
[02:54.37]Yeah?
[02:54.47]He was level 5.
[02:55.67]Yeah, those were the guys that were attacking me.
[02:57.33]Oh, he was level 9.
[02:59.39]Shit, where is this guy?
[03:00.15]He's behind us, just melee him to death.
[03:03.21]Ah, spit.

[03:08.71]Yeah, these guys are low.

[03:10.97]You get the last shot.
[03:12.87]Careful, there's another one.
[03:15.85]Help me.
[03:16.17]Do you need health?
[03:22.40]No, I'm good.
[03:22.78]I need it, I need it.
[03:23.58]You take it.
[03:24.60]You have better health, uh, damage resistance.
[03:26.96]Your shield is better.
[03:28.42]Yeah, my shield, uh, I get health just from having the shield on.
[03:35.12]So did we just come... Oh, weapons.
[03:37.20]Oh, cool.
[03:38.80]Oh, sniper.
[03:39.76]What's with the sniper rifle again?
[03:41.16]Oh, this is a glorious havoc.
[03:42.69]Whoa, okay, let me look at this.
[03:43.99]Oh, I need this.
[03:44.41]This is better than what I have.
[03:46.25]Oh, shit, this is an LMG.
[03:48.73]Oh, wow.
[03:51.36]Oh, no, it only has 19 freaking bullets?
[03:57.26]I just used up half my bullets.
[04:00.30]Just testing the gun, you just lost all your ammunition?
[04:05.21]Yeah.
[04:06.27]Here, come over here.
[04:11.89]Oh, here's another one of the plants.
[04:14.47]Seeds, so we need, what, four more?
[04:15.85]Alright, careful here.
[04:18.43]It looks like, yeah, here they are.
[04:19.47]Where are they?
[04:21.03]Up top.
[04:22.75]I just threw my little dude up there.
[04:26.40]Oh, wow.
[04:27.32]Oh, nice.
[04:30.94]That was intense.
[04:34.56]No scope.
[04:37.45]No scope.
[04:44.06]I need ammo.
[04:50.97]Wow.
[04:52.03]You have what, like two health left?
[04:53.77]Oh, Jesus.
[04:58.31]Open that mouth.
[04:59.69]Open that mouth wide.
[05:01.65]Oh yeah, when you level up, it gives you full health.
[05:06.19]Oh, I'm so out of ammo right now.
[05:08.11]Oh, oh, oh, I have ammo.
[05:18.61]Oh, this thing is so powerful.
[05:20.93]Holy Jesus, but the reload time is complete shit.
[05:24.46]Yeah, that's the problem with the sniper rifles, man.
[05:26.58]There's a lot of health on the ground over there.
[05:29.16]Here, wait, I'm going to increase my... Let me see.
[05:35.60]Picking up a bunch of stuff.
[05:39.73]What do I want?
[05:40.77]Hit and run.
[05:41.33]Gain increased melee damage and phasewalk duration.
[05:44.33]Enforcer.
[05:44.85]Killing an enemy increases whatever radiance you deal shock damage to nearby enemies while phasewalking.
[05:50.52]That's nice.
[05:52.04]Yeah, you're just going to be like an atomic bomb running around.
[05:54.80]Dramatic entrance.
[05:55.72]Your phaseblade can daze enemies, reducing their movements.
[05:59.32]Your phaseblast.
[06:02.39]That's nice.
[06:05.18]Let me just get all my points from around, not just one area.
[06:11.57]Yeah, there's another plant right here.
[06:12.79]Is that five?
[06:14.79]Wait, I need to change my focus.
[06:17.27]No wonder.
[06:17.97]By the seat of your pants, I choose you!
[06:20.50]Oh shit, it says we missed one.
[06:23.98]Oh, really?
[06:24.52]We gotta go back.
[06:27.04]We gotta go back.
[06:35.89]I'm going back to try and find one.
[06:37.71]Wow, you are already all the way down there.
[06:42.14]Did we miss one in here?
[06:43.18]Oh, I'm looking around up here.
[06:46.10]I don't see anything.
[06:49.10]No, we have to go all the way out.
[06:51.02]I see it.
[06:51.58]I see one.
[06:53.77]I see one right here.
[06:54.47]I already got that one.
[06:56.41]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[06:57.45]You did.
[07:02.32]I swear, if there are any damn guys around here... Are you sure we missed it?
[07:07.40]I'm looking at the little icon thing.
[07:09.99]Let me just go back around and try and find it.
[07:15.83]Wait, it says I can't get up there, so... Come on.
[07:26.26]Yeah, maybe there's still one left in the cave.
[07:31.19]You go check that out.
[07:32.13]I'll look back here.
[07:33.75]Oh, can I make the jump?
[07:34.85]I made the jump.
[07:36.41]Oh, there it is.
[07:37.11]I got it right here.
[07:37.85]You're not special.
[07:38.83]Is it right here?
[07:40.90]There we go.
[07:41.40]So that's six.
[07:42.12]That's six out of eight.
[07:43.84]Let's just keep going in the cave.
[07:45.52]We'll see what we can find.
[07:47.48]I am completely out of ammo for my fire SMG.
[07:52.82]Yeah, once we get back to town.
[07:54.31]Uh-huh.
[07:55.07]I'm faster than you, sucker.
[07:56.39]Okay.
[07:57.94]Yeah, I turn around and I'm like, oh, what's that?
[08:00.62]A nice little piece of grass?
[08:02.32]And then I turn around and you're just gone.
[08:05.28]Running like the Flash.
[08:14.89]I really did not actually expect you to be there.
[08:18.14]Really?
[08:18.98]Even though I saw your name.
[08:22.78]I'm trying to act surprised.
[08:24.44]We gotta give the viewers something to like, to think we're like cool, right?
[08:30.13]Yeah.
[08:30.99]Oh, watch it, watch it.
[08:32.07]Skaggs.
[08:35.31]Oh, oh god.
[08:36.29]Oh shit.
[08:37.05]Badass Skagg, huh?
[08:39.41]Oh my god.
[08:40.55]Fight him down here.
[08:41.17]Run down to the bottom of the pit.
[08:42.37]I'm gonna whip a bunch of grenades up there.
[08:47.70]Oh, he's done.
[08:48.62]He is done.
[08:51.50]I'm completely out of ammo in this thing.
[08:53.26]Oh, he's dead.
[08:54.38]He is dead.
[08:56.45]Sucks to be you.
[08:57.35]T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag, T-Bag.
[09:02.27]Oh, here's the seventh one.
[09:04.27]Alright, so the last one must be right around here somewhere.
[09:06.65]Alright, keep on the lookout for another one of those badass gags.
[09:11.34]Those things are fun.
[09:12.24]What do we got in here?
[09:14.52]Oh, we got an SMG.
[09:16.56]That's for you.
[09:18.08]No, I don't need it.
[09:19.58]Oh, you don't need it?
[09:20.76]Nope.
[09:22.03]I'll sell it.
[09:23.97]The only thing I need is fire ammo.
[09:26.03]There's grenades here.
[09:26.87]Which is right here.
[09:29.13]Nope, right there.
[09:30.81]We are out of real estate, man.
[09:32.13]We need to find the last one.
[09:35.23]Let's just go back around here.
[09:36.23]Maybe it leads us to the last one.
[09:39.03]I wouldn't be surprised if that's how they made the level.
[09:43.46]Yeah, you're right.
[09:44.06]It's right there.
[09:45.38]Up on the right.
[09:46.02]Oh yeah, I missed it.
[09:49.34]Do the honors.
[09:50.96]See if I can get up there.
[09:51.72]Or I will.
[09:52.78]Oh, let's see who can get there first.
[09:54.46]Damn it.
[09:55.50]Oh, I got here.
[09:56.42]I got stuck.
[09:57.62]I got it.
[09:57.88]It's because I can't jump.
[09:59.60]Alright, this is the way we have to go out.
[10:03.64]Somewhere around here.
[10:04.20]I don't know.
[10:07.04]Jeebus.
[10:09.02]Oh, Krimbus.
[10:10.33]Where's the way out?
[10:12.37]I don't know.
[10:13.99]Maybe the... Oh, this way.
[10:15.59]Let's come back this way.
[10:18.27]I think this is the way out.
[10:20.19]Looks like there's a little road leading up here.
[10:25.07]Looks... Ah, maybe not.
[10:26.63]Wait, wait.
[10:28.63]We came this way, didn't we?
[10:30.64]Yeah.
[10:32.04]So, turn around.
[10:33.28]Maybe it's the other way.
[10:34.02]Maybe up here.
[10:39.70]Is there a way to go up here?
[10:40.76]Around?
[10:42.76]Yeah, over here.
[10:46.34]Hardy har har.
[10:50.05]So now we got like three or four questions.
[10:52.35]I was like, I'm not taking shit from this guy.
[10:56.84]Mess him up.
[11:00.74]Open that up.
[11:01.46]Open wide.
[11:02.08]Oh, you bastard.
[11:06.48]Oh, you're screwing up my aim there, Skag.
[11:15.03]God, this gun is so powerful.
[11:17.51]Oh, yeah, you...
[11:19.27]You're killing people before I even have a chance.
[11:21.53]That's awesome.
[11:22.65]I'm gonna need that.
[11:23.67]I don't have enough ammo, though.
[11:25.40]The gun has so little ammo, it's ridiculous.
[11:27.74]Once we get back to the town, you can buy up a bunch of the ammo.
[11:31.68]There, I just found some more.
[11:39.02]These things are really useful.
[11:40.13]Breaking these, it's great.
[11:43.87]Wait, where are you going somewhere?
[11:45.71]Oh, shit.
[11:46.09]I think it's up here, it says.
[11:49.42]Oh, boy.
[11:50.20]I just saw a big guy dive across the bridge.
[11:55.18]Dumbass opens the door.
[11:56.70]Over here, big boy!
[11:58.82]Big boy?
[12:00.57]Big boy!
[12:02.01]I love watching Onyx Pranks.
[12:03.77]Oh, yeah.
[12:04.33]Look at somebody!
[12:08.87]I want to... I don't even know how he does that, man.
[12:12.23]Like... God, that thing is nice.
[12:17.40]Never-ending...
[12:18.56]Welp, Brigade.
[12:19.64]Alright, so let's... Oh, there's the way out.
[12:24.70]Too bad I'm going to get there before you suck them.
[12:28.06]We're going to get a bunch of money right here.
[12:32.28]Yeah, when we finish the... What's it called?
[12:35.36]Oh, a grounded shield.
[12:36.52]It has shock resistance.
[12:38.61]It's 6,000 and I don't even have close to that much.
[12:41.49]It's great.
[12:42.13]I like the one I'm using right now.
[12:43.33]The one I'm using right now is pretty good.
[12:47.51]It's pretty much worth it.
[12:48.79]Oh, let's see.
[12:53.27]Yeah, I need to get ammo.
[12:54.38]That's what I need to do.
[12:56.00]So what is this even?
[12:57.44]The gun I currently have?
[12:58.90]Oh, you can upgrade the amount of ammo you can hold.
[13:02.36]Really?
[13:02.88]See, if you go to the grenade station thing with the ammo station?
[13:07.58]Oh, yeah, wait.
[13:09.16]I don't know what I have.
[13:10.02]That's the problem.
[13:11.60]Is it a combat rifle or explosive longbow?
[13:16.55]Dude, there's longbows?
[13:19.03]I guess, huh?
[13:21.06]Explosive longbow?
[13:25.20]Wait, what is this gun that I have?
[13:26.86]I don't know.
[13:29.00]I gotta get more ammo.
[13:31.77]It's a TCH-29 Glorious Havoc.
[13:35.57]It's a Vladov.
[13:37.05]Does it say anything about where it, uh... Nope.
[13:45.16]Maximum amount of ammo, that doesn't make any sense.
[13:54.93]Alright.
[13:56.57]Can hold more ammo now, that's good.
[14:00.19]Shields, let me buy some grenades.
[14:01.67]Oh, I already got full grenades.
[14:05.49]Do I have a combat rifle or a SMG?
[14:08.85]Whatever, I'll buy the SMG one because that's what I usually use.
[14:13.22]And, nope, didn't upgrade, but okay.
[14:15.63]I mean, I can sell stuff anyways, so whatever.
[14:18.05]The RF repeater I can sell.
[14:20.91]The cheap repeater I can sell.
[14:23.19]The fangroot repeater I'll... No, I don't like it.
[14:27.91]I'll keep the relentless essence.
[14:29.99]No.
[14:34.60]Yeah, I'll sell this one too.
[14:40.28]Wheelin' and dealin'.
[14:44.96]Oh wait, why don't I have my reinforced thermal shield equipped?
[14:49.08]That's great.
[14:51.44]Oh jeez, that's bad.
[14:53.72]Re-equip my shield, which I needed.
[14:57.30]You are in your menu, you look like a badass.
[15:00.70]You look like you're flexing your skinny arms.
[15:03.69]I totally was flexing.
[15:07.33]Shut up.
[15:07.85]Here we go, travel!
[15:10.71]Totes.
[15:13.23]Hi, I'm Claptrap.
[15:14.79]I'm an annoying son of a bitch.
[15:23.28]Okay, where do we go now?
[15:24.16]Let's go turn these in and... Let's go.
[15:32.44]I'm enjoying this.
[15:33.20]This is fun.
[15:34.08]Yeah, watch out behind you.
[15:35.10]Hello!
