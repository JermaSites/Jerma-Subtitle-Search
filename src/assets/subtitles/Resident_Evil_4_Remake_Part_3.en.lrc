[ve:60.16.100]

[00:22.23]Alright, hello.
[00:22.95]Sorry about that.
[00:25.23]Sorry about that.
[00:34.15]I was in pre-stream chat talking for a little too long.
[00:38.66]Didn't manage my time well.
[00:42.48]And I'm technically 50 minutes late.
[00:46.16]Although I did update it and technically I'm 20 minutes late.
[00:50.16]Sorry.
[00:53.95]It was good talks.
[00:54.61]It was a good talk.
[00:55.59]It was a good talk.
[00:56.61]It was.
[01:00.51]Yeah.
[01:00.71]Hello.
[01:02.79]Welcome back.
[01:05.31]You were here yesterday.
[01:06.11]We're going to do the same thing we did yesterday.
[01:07.70]We're going to keep going through Resident Evil 4.
[01:13.68]I think I'm about halfway through the game.
[01:18.97]Seems like I'm about, there's probably another, probably 12 hours left.
[01:26.24]So after tonight's stream, if I stream for, you know, five to seven hours tonight, there'll probably be one more at some point midweek next week.
[01:45.66]After I finish Resident Evil 4 Remake, we're going to go back into Breath of the Wild.
[01:55.61]I'm not going to promise that I'm going to complete Breath of the Wild in this time period next week, but I'm going to continue progressing through it.
[02:07.34]Maybe one or two streams of Breath of the Wild.
[02:11.81]And we'll see.
[02:12.37]I don't want to rush through Breath of the Wild.
[02:13.61]I don't want to sprint as fast as I can through it.
[02:16.55]I saw some concerns saying, hey, dude, you're going to sprint as fast as you can through that because you want to just be done with it, don't you?
[02:24.95]And I typed yes, but then I deleted it and said, no, that's not going to happen.
[02:30.25]So I don't want to do that.
[02:36.18]No, I'm kidding.
[02:37.10]I'm going to take my time through it like I already have.
[02:40.99]When does the new one come out?
[02:41.97]May?
[02:50.15]May.
[02:50.65]May 12th.
[02:51.21]I got plenty of time.
[02:53.76]I don't think I'm going to play the new Zelda game the day it launches.
[03:00.08]There's plenty of time to play the new one.
[03:01.86]I don't know.
[03:02.22]Maybe I don't.
[03:03.04]Do I?
[03:03.64]We'll see.
[03:05.39]Breath of the Wild came out in 2016.
[03:08.67]It took me like seven years to play it.
[03:11.27]So I don't know.
[03:12.39]Well, I don't know.
[03:13.09]We'll see.
[03:13.53]I'm already setting him up for disappointment.
[03:18.96]I'm already setting you guys up for disappointment.
[03:22.32]Well, you know what?
[03:22.88]It took me six years to play the other one.
[03:25.78]Like, why wouldn't it take me years to play the new one?
[03:29.23]There's a lot of sadges in chat, I think, after that one.
[03:37.73]2017, yeah.
[03:40.94]What about Hylics 2?
[03:42.14]Oh, yeah.
[03:47.18]I don't care, bro.
[03:49.80]Actually, that's, like, kind of cool.
[03:52.76]Yeah, that's, like, that doesn't bother me.
[03:55.50]To me, you just said, hey, man, I don't even care.
[03:57.99]Do whatever you want.
[03:59.97]Alright, thanks.
[04:00.45]The one guy of the year.
[04:03.19]That's one guy of the year.
[04:05.07]For me.
[04:14.31]I care.
[04:14.83]I care.
[04:16.54]It's alright to care.
[04:17.24]Hey, I care too.
[04:21.00]Yeah, I'm already really late, so we're just going to go.
[04:24.04]What was the last thing I did?
[04:29.63]I'm already late.
[04:31.49]I stall for 20-30 minutes every stream anyways, so let's go.
[04:35.23]I was in the castle.
[04:41.60]There he is.
[04:47.25]yes facecam facecam yeah I turn it on this is the time to turn it on I told you guys the 2023 philosophy I feel like turning it on I'm gonna turn it on I feel like I felt like turning it on the last like couple weeks going off real goddamn soon alright let me take a sip
[05:13.81]Ooh, okay.
[05:16.29]So, what was the last thing we did?
[05:19.81]Head for the ball.
[05:20.25]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:22.45]I just did the shooting gallery, shooting game thing.
[05:28.37]What is in here?
[05:31.43]Oh, it's one of these like square key things.
[05:35.53]There's three of those.
[05:36.29]Ooh, you have the stench of battle on you, mate.
[05:49.77]Thank you.
[05:51.35]Want a tip?
[05:53.41]If you want to do a good laugh, a good kind of laugh like I just did.
[05:58.26]A lot of people think, oh, breathe in.
[06:01.24]No, no, no, you do it.
[06:02.02]That's not correct.
[06:03.94]Get a little bit of air out first.
[06:08.50]Because then it's literally just like your diaphragm doing the work.
[06:13.73]Don't go too hard, though.
[06:14.51]Be careful.
[06:18.22]He's doing theater lessons.
[06:19.52]Yeah, theater lessons.
[06:25.59]Dude, your breath smells.
[06:32.12]Yeah, so here's the difference, right?
[06:33.22]Listen to the difference.
[06:40.83]Which one sounded better?
[06:50.27]The second one.
[06:55.15]Yeah.
[06:57.38]It's all about, you know, breathing control and diaphragm control.
[07:02.10]Now that that does not mean go and like choke.
[07:08.96]It's all about just breathing and diaphragm.
[07:12.63]I'm not expelling that much air when I do that.
[07:17.91]What is he talking about?
[07:21.45]I don't know.
[07:24.11]Who got us on this?
[07:24.85]Alright, we're going to go this way.
[07:27.98]Cool.
[07:28.46]Sweet.
[07:30.04]Turn it up for me.
[07:30.86]How's the volume?
[07:31.46]Is it kind of low?
[07:33.56]Turn it up a little bit.
[07:38.22]You did.
[07:42.21]Sorry.
[07:45.11]Alright, there's the head.
[07:45.83]There it is.
[07:53.29]Oh, it's one of those people.
[07:54.69]We're sandwiched, alright?
[07:59.52]Oh yeah, you almost turned into a sandwich.
[08:02.90]I'm in a fucked up mood tonight.
[08:04.12]I'm sorry it's already starting.
[08:20.26]Where is he?
[08:30.24]Oh, you piece of shit.
[08:31.36]Whatever.
[08:34.42]I know where he is!
[08:41.25]No!
[08:48.65]No!
[08:57.00]Stop backseat gaming, Ashley!
[08:58.88]Come on!
[09:02.93]Stop backseating!
[09:04.03]She's backseating!
[09:09.63]Quick, die!
[09:33.30]What is this head made out of?
[09:34.88]Fucking metal?
[09:36.78]What is... Oh my god, this is a bad start.
[09:38.89]This is off to a really fucking bad start.
[09:41.55]This is a bad start.
[09:43.19]Did he suplex me?
[09:44.39]Alright, that was a bad start.
[09:50.19]That was a bad start.
[09:51.11]That's a bad start.
[09:58.61]It was a bastard.
[09:59.55]My arrows were bouncing off of his head.
[10:01.37]They were just bouncing off of his face.
[10:03.51]Alright.
[10:11.42]This time, I'm not going to let him do that.
[10:16.36]We're not gaming tonight?
[10:17.80]Yeah, we are.
[10:20.94]I gotta just get back in the swing of it.
[10:25.02]Huh.
[10:25.68]Won't open.
[10:28.08]I'm taking this guy out immediately.
[10:43.41]Eat this.
[10:48.11]No!
[10:50.26]Blow it up!
[10:50.94]How do I blow it up?
[10:52.48]How do I blow the mine up?
[10:56.35]Take the food out of the microwave.
[10:57.72]How do I do that?
[10:59.48]How do I blow it up?
[11:01.20]How do you blow up the mine?
[11:05.06]How do I blow the mine up?
[11:11.27]It's a proximity mine.
[11:12.81]Oh.
[11:18.49]It's a proximity mine.
[11:24.10]So, if I attach it to his body, does that count as movement?
[11:35.62]Yes, so I just have to aim better.
[11:37.12]Got it.
[11:42.91]Okay, here we go.
[11:47.31]He's still alive?
[11:47.99]Oh my god.
[12:05.17]Get up!
[12:08.20]I thought she said she was okay.
[12:13.32]She just dropped.
[12:16.24]Stop!
[12:18.07]Why is this so stressful?
[12:29.32]What?
[12:29.56]No!
[12:29.86]Are you dead?
[12:39.33]She keeps getting fucking suplexed.
[12:47.56]He's finally dead.
[13:02.06]That was so horrible.
[13:15.59]You hurt?
[13:16.17]I'm good.
[13:16.79]Thanks.
[13:29.18]You know that move that they do in wrestling where they take your body flat and you're lying kind of down facing down and they press you up and they hold you there and it's like and then they let you go.
[13:45.33]That happened to her like five times.
[13:49.09]They just like push you up and then let you go after a while and you just like pancake onto the mat.
[13:58.43]Yeah, it's called the Gorilla Press.
[14:00.93]Yeah.
[14:05.03]Wasn't that the Ultimate Warrior's finishing move?
[14:09.69]The Ultimate Warrior would sprint.
[14:11.27]Oh, the Ultimate Warrior was ridiculous.
[14:15.01]The Ultimate Warrior, if you don't know what his shtick was...
[14:19.95]He had this superhero symbol was painted on him, whatever it was, I don't remember.
[14:27.69]He was in a Speedo and his entrance music, he would sprint as fast as he could into the ring.
[14:37.11]He never spent, I don't think it was ever more than three seconds it took him to get to the ring.
[14:43.94]He would just sprint out there, running as fast as he can, and then he would just be going... Like, for 20 minutes in the beginning of the fight.
[14:53.80]And he would grab the ropes, he would grab the top ropes, you know those three ropes?
[14:58.48]He would grab the top one, and fucking shake it!
[15:02.36]Like this.
[15:04.16]Like four or five times during the match.
[15:06.92]It was fucking crazy.
[15:14.68]That was his finishing move.
[15:16.08]He would press you in the air while doing the... And he would fucking let you go.
[15:21.48]That was enough to, like, kill you, apparently.
[15:23.50]Whatever it was.
[15:24.02]Ugh.
[15:29.34]Old wrestling was just so... Out of control.
[15:32.42]This dude loves violence.
[15:50.37]Irma loves murder.
[16:06.90]Wrestling is... I mean, those guys, they put their bodies through hell.
[16:18.67]But to me, I always loved wrestling because it was sort of like a series of real-life Looney Tunes gags.
[16:24.28]Just kind of chained up together.
[16:25.60]There's a lot of athleticism that goes into being a wrestler.
[16:31.58]I just loved the... It was like a cartoon.
[16:34.07]It was like a living cartoon with real superheroes.
[16:37.91]It was great.
[16:38.43]Alright, is there anything else here?
[16:48.20]Whoa.
[16:48.36]How many more of those are in here?
[16:52.14]Alright, there's only two more.
[16:59.43]Did I miss any other items?
[17:03.30]Maybe.
[17:18.51]Did I already go up there?
[17:21.63]There's bullets I didn't get.
[17:22.65]Where is that?
[17:23.37]I think it's on the actual thing over here.
[17:26.08]Yeah.
[17:34.48]Are you frozen?
[17:41.63]I shouldn't be.
[17:42.07]If I'm frozen on your screen, then I might need to refresh.
[17:52.26]Alright, there's that one.
[17:58.46]Watch out!
[18:04.00]What?
[18:04.22]I bounced off this guy.
[18:05.48]But this guy, honestly, it's the tank.
[18:08.57]You know what I... Yeah, you specced into tanking.
[18:11.55]You already have a tank behind you.
[18:12.77]You ruined the fucking party.
[18:16.67]Ashley!
[18:21.31]You're right.
[18:23.68]And look what happened.
[18:25.83]The overzealous DPS ran in, took one hit, fucked everything up.
[18:30.29]The tank went in front of the tank.
[18:32.41]Then the tank dies because there's no DPS.
[18:36.51]They're probably swearing at each other in a Discord call right now.
[18:43.24]We're talking real friend-ending shit right there.
[18:59.69]OK.
[18:59.83]Let's go.
[19:02.97]Here I got everything in it.
[19:04.31]I'm going to save it though.
[19:07.79]You could cosplay as Leon and pull it off.
[19:11.59]I would need to wear tall shoes, I think.
[19:16.11]Isn't Leon like 6'2 or something?
[19:19.32]Leon's like 6'3.
[19:21.52]Breaks over, I suppose.
[19:33.23]I got a lot of money.
[19:35.47]He's 5'11"?
[19:35.89]He's 5'10".
[19:36.52]Really?
[19:37.78]Oh, maybe he is.
[19:39.32]That's alright.
[19:40.26]That's only like three inches that I need.
[19:42.50]I can do that.
[20:11.31]Alright, let's go... I can't go that way.
[20:15.77]Down this way, probably.
[20:23.00]5'11"?
[20:23.08]Well, I'm 5'7", 5'8", with shoes.
[20:38.17]You don't get carsick or anything, do you?
[20:42.50]I love wearing dress shoes.
[20:48.11]Dressing up for an event.
[20:48.89]Because those things give you at least, at least like 0.8 inches.
[20:54.09]Like at least one full inch.
[20:56.19]That's great.
[20:56.59]I walk around like a fucking boss.
[20:58.53]You know what I mean?
[20:59.47]Every time I wear dress shoes and I got that extra inch, extra inch and a half, I walk around like I fucking own the place.
[21:06.40]You know what I'm saying?
[21:17.76]Ooh.
[21:22.61]That's a lot.
[21:26.19]Do I have enough to finish this right now?
[21:30.57]It's three square three.
[21:32.13]I could put it all in here and probably make 100 grand.
[21:34.05]Should I do that?
[21:42.10]Alright.
[21:42.60]What's better?
[21:43.18]Filling this with only reds.
[21:48.37]or taking those over here and finishing it it's just filling the crown up and selling it we're better than just putting all reds in here in red all red all red if you have all different colors it's 100k I don't know if I'll be able
[22:15.94]Oh, wait a minute.
[22:16.96]I can do that.
[22:17.60]I'm going back.
[22:18.24]Hold on.
[22:18.94]I can do that.
[22:20.54]I have enough to do that.
[22:23.92]I think I have enough.
[22:30.69]I don't?
[22:31.09]No, yeah, I do.
[22:32.53]I have green, purple, and red.
[22:34.21]And then I have red and... Wait.
[22:39.78]Can I not do it?
[22:42.13]I need a blue gem.
[22:43.41]I wonder if he sells one.
[22:44.73]What does he sell?
[22:45.31]OK, so we got.
[22:56.00]Green.
[22:56.34]Purple.
[22:56.48]Red.
[22:56.66]Oh, then red.
[23:10.36]Wait, I can red yellow?
[23:16.38]So if I had a blue instead of this red one, it would be worth $100,000.
[23:19.38]What does he say?
[23:24.49]Alright, I'm going to hold on to it then.
[23:29.57]Because I don't think I've ever done that before.
[23:34.47]I need a blue gem.
[23:38.29]That's a guaranteed 100K if I can find a blue.
[23:42.53]Pretty sick, pretty cool.
[23:44.20]Come on.
[23:45.56]No problem.
[23:46.44]It's an achievement as well.
[23:48.16]Oh cool.
[23:54.54]We're here.
[24:01.09]Talk about A Fox in Space again?
[24:03.09]Yeah.
[24:04.55]I had the privilege of cameoing in the second episode of A Fox in Space.
[24:11.77]Can we get a link to it?
[24:13.42]Can one of the mods put it in the chat?
[24:14.98]It was really, really cool.
[24:17.68]I don't want to spoil anything, but it's very quick.
[24:21.44]It's like...
[24:24.62]10 seconds, I think.
[24:26.44]So... If you see it, you'll see it.
[24:29.68]It's really, really cool to be any part of that at all, so... There it is.
[24:45.09]Do more voice acting.
[24:48.99]Yeah, I... Over the years...
[24:55.00]So I had a lot of passion to do like voices and stuff and make sound effects.
[24:59.65]You guys know that.
[25:00.35]It's like 70% of every live stream.
[25:04.41]But I think my happiness and my passions lie in kind of doing it here.
[25:09.26]Like I just have fun doing it in front of you guys.
[25:12.66]Rather than other characters or something.
[25:15.08]I think it's just fun to do it.
[25:15.94]I know you have three voices, Andy.
[25:17.84]Four voices, Andy.
[25:18.77]I know.
[25:19.11]But it's still fun to do it here.
[25:21.27]I have, like, more fun doing it kind of here.
[25:24.63]Rather than, like, in a studio booth or, you know, under a recording session.
[25:28.25]I actually have more fun doing it just walking around.
[25:30.68]I don't want to miss anything.
[25:50.03]Somebody asked like how did I might be making this up and somebody just say like, how did you learn that you could do that?
[25:54.79]Or how did you like want?
[25:55.93]How did you know you wanted to or something?
[25:59.84]I've always just been an incredibly high energy person.
[26:04.38]Even when I'm sitting around, and that's ADHD, right?
[26:07.80]That's part of it.
[26:10.00]But it was always... I just had to expel fucking energy, and that was kind of the way I did it.
[26:17.72]And that sort of bled into my adult life, which is kind of weird, but...
[26:25.76]I always just had a lot of energy.
[26:27.26]And it was actually kind of a problem when I was younger.
[26:29.80]It got me... Hold on.
[26:35.42]Oh, they're climbing!
[26:36.74]They're climbing!
[26:43.35]What just happened?
[26:44.47]Put me out!
[26:44.99]Put me out!
[26:45.75]Do something!
[26:46.21]Put me out!
[26:55.74]Oh, shit.
[26:57.74]Well, Ashley, what are you?
[27:14.36]Like a grenade.
[27:25.66]No, no, this is auto-saved.
[27:35.77]Wait.
[27:40.31]I knew I heard it.
[27:44.83]Take that damn mask off of Ashley.
[27:47.58]I...
[27:53.59]It's unlockable.
[27:54.85]It's only been on for like two minutes.
[27:59.49]Why did I open this?
[28:03.70]Hey!
[28:07.86]Hey!
[28:09.48]Stop that!
[28:15.99]Alright.
[28:17.01]Come over here.
[28:27.92]I gotta go kill the guy that makes all the flog us come out of your head.
[28:34.28]That guy's gotta die now.
[28:36.20]Like, immediately.
[28:47.45]I'm sprinting right to that guy.
[28:48.75]And, you know what?
[28:51.23]Stay back.
[28:51.97]Don't even come over here.
[29:39.87]Shit.
[29:40.21]Where is the mage or whatever it is?
[29:51.36]Where's the mage?
[30:03.07]Where's the mage?
[30:07.05]Oh.
[30:08.57]Oh, you're dead.
[30:09.19]Alright, cool.
[30:10.13]I guess I accidentally killed that person.
[30:13.10]With a grenade?
[30:18.26]Finish the story.
[30:19.14]What was I saying?
[30:21.64]Give me like one keyword and I'll help figure it out.
[30:24.85]What was it?
[30:32.32]Eye energy as a kid.
[30:33.38]Oh, I mean, that kind of stuff gets into trouble, right?
[30:35.93]Like, trying to not being able to be quiet and always having to, like, I needed to move around all the fucking time.
[30:44.23]And it was kind of a detriment a lot of times.
[30:53.77]But over the years, I've obviously gotten a little better at... I don't need to be down here.
[31:15.33]I think I had higher energy as a kid, but I was better at masking it.
[31:21.68]Yeah, I mean, everybody's different, right?
[31:25.10]So my situation versus your situation versus somebody else's situation is always going to be different.
[31:31.77]But I had a lot of, you know, communication with, you know, doctors and family and it was, uh, everybody's different.
[31:41.01]That's why it's kind of a, usually a case by case basis a lot of times.
[31:46.29]Alright, where do I need to go?
[31:47.39]I'm going the complete wrong direction right now.
[31:51.81]How did I end up going back here?
[31:53.70]Why did I go back here?
[31:57.12]I mean, it was cool.
[31:57.90]I got some kills, right?
[31:59.42]But what am I doing over here?
[32:09.22]I'm sitting here explaining how I've had, oh, ADHD over the years.
[32:13.41]And as I've been walking fucking backwards the whole time.
[32:18.11]That's just par for the course, I think, isn't it?
[32:23.42]I rode the train all the way back here.
[32:36.67]Alright, that was actually a nice.
[32:38.13]That was actually a lot of help.
[32:39.65]I appreciate that actually.
[32:50.82]Not bad, right?
[32:52.14]Did you forget how to parry?
[32:53.80]No, I just feel like people have been behind me the whole time.
[32:56.82]Alright, let's just go.
[32:58.34]Just go.
[33:01.59]Do the suplex.
[33:02.87]I will.
[33:04.94]I tried to parry that, and you can't parry that.
[33:07.08]Get out of here.
[33:13.77]I'm getting money, at least.
[33:25.74]I could have taken the cart back.
[33:28.30]It's alright.
[33:40.01]I'm walking through the whole game again.
[33:43.23]This is just absolutely quintessential.
[33:47.95]I know where I'm going.
[33:50.14]No, you don't.
[33:52.52]I'm already in too deep, though.
[33:53.50]I have to keep going.
[33:56.84]At least every door is open.
[34:04.50]Hi.
[34:04.76]Yes.
[34:10.11]I seriously went so fucking far away.
[34:12.41]I have to go through the whole maze again?
[34:13.79]Should I just restart?
[34:22.73]No, I can go through here.
[34:24.09]No big deal.
[34:34.73]It's just a straight path from here, is it?
[34:39.48]Is it a straight path from here?
[34:49.95]Let's do a factory reset.
[34:55.61]No, I'm just gonna run.
[34:56.85]We're good.
[35:04.01]Glad I came back.
[35:04.63]It's 200 bucks.
[35:19.83]I did not think that that was going to be here.
[35:21.25]Hey, we made it and I got the goat head, whatever it is.
[35:27.58]This took us an extra five minutes, sorry.
[35:44.65]Ah, this shit is ice cold today.
[35:45.89]Perfect.
[36:01.52]Okay, so I was going the right way.
[36:05.52]I went back here from the cart, which I did not want to do that.
[36:14.74]I need to go up this way.
[36:17.80]Through here, maybe?
[36:23.42]This is locked.
[36:31.00]Here we go.
[36:33.81]Rats have infested a section of the castle and are gnawing away at all the precious books.
[36:39.88]Okay.
[36:40.80]Get rid of the rats.
[36:42.32]In the Grand Hall Library.
[36:44.00]Imagining that's in here.
[36:49.70]I really don't like doing this, but I'm gonna.
[36:52.36]I really don't like it.
[36:54.22]I don't want to shoot these rats.
[36:57.91]I don't like it.
[37:02.38]That's something sacrilege about what I'm doing.
[37:11.61]This is... I don't like this.
[37:12.69]I really don't like it.
[37:13.93]I don't like it.
[37:14.45]I don't like it.
[37:31.58]Betrayed.
[37:32.19]Betrayer.
[37:35.63]Oh.
[37:40.13]Puzzle time!
[37:44.05]Okay, the stork is looking at that chair right there, and that chair is sitting across from these drapes.
[37:48.08]These drapes are spread open.
[37:49.78]That means two.
[37:50.68]One and two on either side, which are these two.
[37:53.00]These two are exactly...
[37:55.85]15 feet apart, which is 15, count to 15.
[37:58.85]One, two, three, that counts as four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[38:06.21]There are only 10 seats, so subtract 10, so that means five.
[38:09.04]The answer to the door is five.
[38:10.16]So, you do a lot of missions like this?
[38:15.72]Well, yeah, but I'm not used to having such good company.
[38:20.68]Is that a compliment?
[38:23.50]Take it however you want.
[38:31.42]E is the fifth letter of the alphabet.
[38:34.35]Alright, I'm done.
[38:45.23]It's like grandpa's birthday picture.
[38:54.76]Are they eating napkins?
[39:01.70]Alright, two knives, fork, spoon.
[39:05.50]Three knives, two forks, spoon.
[39:14.63]Okay.
[39:28.70]And it was- that's his.
[39:32.56]We had two knives eating a napkin.
[39:38.44]Two knives, fork, spoon.
[39:43.87]No.
[39:44.91]No.
[39:48.59]This is it right here?
[39:57.52]Have a seat.
[39:58.86]No problem.
[40:12.44]Take it.
[40:22.82]Serpent head.
[40:28.90]The last one is over here.
[40:29.92]I probably unlock it somehow.
[40:31.88]What is this item?
[40:33.19]Oh, it's this.
[40:42.09]Hmm.
[40:42.77]Oh, okay.
[40:52.82]Cool.
[40:54.04]Put this back on.
[40:54.96]Hmm.
[41:17.57]You hear it ticking?
[41:26.05]Alright, I need the... I need the last head.
[41:33.77]Was it a lion?
[41:35.45]Alright, I need the lion head.
[41:49.19]How do I get this?
[41:55.16]Oh shit, I missed an herb.
[41:58.86]What season are you?
[42:08.02]I like summer and winter both equally the same.
[42:12.84]Who is this red herb?
[42:15.53]Oh, it's on the table.
[42:20.96]Summer and winter are my two favorite seasons.
[42:26.66]Although if you're talking about smells, fall smells the best.
[42:30.08]Fall has the best smell.
[42:31.06]Fall has the best smell.
[42:37.65]Summer has the best body feel.
[42:42.03]Spring has the best visual.
[42:45.22]And winter has the best togetherness.
[42:54.62]There you go.
[43:00.40]Oh, I had a big raid.
[43:01.04]We got a big raid came in.
[43:02.61]Linkus, thanks for the raid, Linkus.
[43:09.67]Appreciate the raid.
[43:10.27]Welcome, everybody.
[43:12.46]Togetherness, yeah.
[43:13.52]Usually, you can't really... Winter is kind of an indoor season.
[43:19.24]I mean, unless you're going skiing or you're out, you gotta really bundle up.
[43:23.30]To me, winter is more like I'm drinking a hot coffee or hot cocoa or something and I'm inside and we're watching a movie.
[43:28.32]You know what I'm saying?
[43:36.64]I think that's pretty accurate for me.
[43:37.84]Maybe it's not accurate for you.
[43:39.29]We're different people.
[43:41.58]This dude's addicted to coffee.
[43:43.10]I mean, probably.
[43:44.50]Alright, what am I... Where's this last head?
[43:51.47]Here?
[43:52.65]Is there a door here?
[44:17.07]Oh look, there might be a door there.
[44:18.53]There actually might be.
[44:19.45]Yeah, welcome raiders.
[44:28.55]There is a door there.
[44:38.92]Hey Leon, there's some armor.
[44:40.86]Bet you could use it like a bulletproof vest.
[44:43.86]Little old fashioned for my taste.
[44:46.96]These are gonna move.
[44:55.35]I don't remember what happens in here, but... We'll see.
[45:01.83]There is one more of those right here.
[45:10.78]What is making that sound?
[45:18.23]Irma, I lost all my channel points voting for a turtle in pre-stream.
[45:22.17]Sad.
[45:24.98]I don't even know the context of what you're saying.
[45:27.68]What does that even mean?
[45:31.43]Where was there a turtle?
[45:54.31]There it is.
[45:58.66]Whatever health.
[45:59.22]I need some yellow herbs.
[46:24.93]These guys move.
[46:25.91]These guys move.
[46:27.57]There's no way these guys don't move.
[46:59.48]Get all the items first.
[47:01.88]That's Resident Evil 101.
[47:03.88]Welcome to class.
[47:05.95]When you touch the thing, 25 enemies are going to run after you.
[47:10.35]Collect everything first.
[47:14.19]Everything.
[47:15.03]That is Resident Evil 101.
[47:17.23]Welcome to the lesson.
[47:20.35]We're clear.
[47:21.57]I'm ready to start the encounter.
[47:32.09]That count?
[47:46.18]Oh, you can't parry that.
[47:47.72]That's not getting parried.
[47:55.63]Jesus.
[48:14.85]Oh, shit.
[48:17.77]Oh, shit.
[48:18.33]Uh-oh.
[48:47.81]What do you just do what's going on actually it's okay just stay safe just
[49:25.75]Dude, I'm out!
[49:27.79]I'm out!
[49:33.54]I'm gonna have to switch over to this.
[50:01.77]Damn, I'm almost out of everything.
[50:02.95]I got no ammo.
[50:10.35]I'm almost completely clean out of everything.
[50:14.57]No, I'm good.
[50:16.57]Is this where this weapon is going to really shine?
[50:21.70]Because I got nothing.
[50:34.76]Time to utilize the weapon that has infinite ammo if you're good.
[50:43.39]Ashley.
[50:44.65]Got it.
[50:51.55]Stop minus twoing Leon.
[51:00.46]That's kind of rude.
[51:01.38]Yeah.
[51:02.48]Stop.
[51:03.26]You don't think they're going to move, do you?
[51:06.76]Ooh, there it is.
[51:08.04]I got the cube.
[51:12.50]Hold on, I forgot to blink for like 45 minutes.
[51:14.20]Oh, damn.
[51:24.95]Okay.
[51:39.64]Damn it, I need to save this ammo.
[51:50.62]There's one more somewhere in here.
[51:58.39]One more rat.
[52:03.19]Hook up a shock collar to have -2 and +2 activated.
[52:08.62]If it's really bad, I just get electrocuted.
[52:12.88]How would that work?
[52:14.10]If there's more than, like, 500 minus twos in chat, I get shocked.
[52:17.86]Uh, I don't think so.
[52:24.18]What happens if I get a bunch of plus twos, then?
[52:27.14]What's the reward that I get?
[52:35.96]You get candy.
[52:37.28]A cookie, a candy dispenser.
[52:39.54]A candy dispenser?
[52:45.59]What kind of weird experiment is this?
[52:49.23]There's just like a device that's in the corner over here that if I get enough plus twos, like a little candy comes out and I'm like, I run over there and I unwrap it.
[52:57.29]What the hell kind of, what is the stream that you're referring to?
[53:08.60]That's the idea.
[53:09.40]Matilda.
[53:12.36]I don't like it.
[53:13.08]I don't like first fire.
[53:16.86]I always land the first shot and the other two just miss.
[53:44.36]I'll hold onto him for now.
[53:50.46]I'll buy almost anything.
[53:56.13]I don't always have this in stock, stranger.
[53:59.53]Stocking up while you can.
[54:01.03]Wise choice.
[54:02.98]Anything.
[54:03.32]Don't get yourself.
[54:44.89]Say something.
[54:50.54]I'm fine.
[54:57.02]I need to do a big turn in here.
[54:59.21]I've got like $200,000 worth of shit in my inventory.
[55:11.31]W-A-S-D-Q-E.
[55:12.91]Okay, I need that on the bottom.
[55:16.13]Is that correct?
[55:24.25]Yeah, that's it.
[55:34.41]Where's the... There's another one of those.
[55:35.75]Where is it?
[55:40.69]It's over here, isn't it?
[55:45.29]That's it right there, right?
[55:56.36]Alright.
[55:56.70]I don't even know what the fuck that person's saying.
[55:58.66]Alright.
[56:02.03]It's back there.
[56:03.31]I'm going to take the car because I want to go do the other cube thing because I will forget and I will not do it.
[56:10.99]It also might be over here too.
[56:14.73]Let's go.
[56:17.45]Okay, time to go on the car.
[56:27.04]Just behind me.
[56:34.84]This way.
[56:36.16]Okay.
[56:41.58]What are you saying?
[56:45.28]It's a fancy car.
[56:50.68]I don't know.
[56:51.83]Melt that thing down and go rebuild a fucking school.
[56:53.87]You know what I'm saying?
[56:55.73]Like, this thing, that could be made out of wood.
[56:57.61]It could be made out of... You could put some nice gold trimming on it.
[56:59.51]You know what I mean?
[57:00.21]Like...
[57:09.41]Does that gotta be a $10 million?
[57:10.55]It could be a $1 million cart.
[57:12.43]Does it gotta be a $10 million cart?
[57:13.68]Alright, where is it?
[57:23.36]Is it up or is it across?
[57:24.70]I think it could be a $5 million cart.
[57:31.19]That could be a $5 million cart.
[57:34.33]All good.
[57:41.47]He's molding over golden pixels.
[58:06.64]I had breakfast this morning.
[58:09.36]If anyone is curious.
[58:20.22]No, he's supposed to fail.
[58:21.42]He's supposed to fail those puzzles for 20 fucking minutes.
[58:33.36]I wasted my candy.
[58:36.35]Where's the candy?
[58:37.07]Dispense.
[58:43.07]But acting superior.
[58:50.92]Imagine... If I ever have a Disneyland ride to go to the kitchen, pause the movie and go to the kitchen to get the popcorn, you need to get on a Disneyland ride to get there?
[59:13.13]I don't know, man.
[59:14.83]I think that's a little much.
[59:16.11]I think that's a little much.
[59:24.14]I hate big fucking spaces.
[59:25.98]They piss me off.
[59:27.38]I don't know why.
[59:28.80]I do know why, because I lose shit all the time.
[59:30.92]I need just a few rooms.
[59:38.78]You know what I'm saying?
[59:40.34]Too many places for me to... I would get lost.
[59:49.63]You gotta take Splash Mountain to get to your living room.
[60:00.48]I mean, that's like fucking funny.
[60:10.94]That would be so annoying after a while.
[60:14.15]Okay, but what if you do the Splash Mountain ride to get to the kitchen?
[60:21.03]And then you take the monorail back to the living room.
[60:25.12]And then you realize, I left my fucking phone on the counter in the kitchen.
[60:28.90]You have to ride Splash Mountain again.
[60:33.02]That would suck.
[60:34.80]You'd be like, I don't want to ride that again.
[60:40.33]Or is it a case of you have so much money that there's a phone in every room?
[60:51.92]You know what I always did want?
[60:53.04]This is back when cell phones really weren't a thing.
[60:57.85]I always wanted one of those phones next to the toilet.
[61:02.89]You know how much shit I would be able to get done?
[61:10.58]I'd be able to get so much stuff done.
[61:29.46]This is loud.
[61:32.79]What are you getting done?
[61:33.69]Meetings.
[61:34.03]That'd have to be a bunch of sound dampening.
[61:46.16]There's gotta be a bunch of sound dampening in that run.
[61:51.30]In that room.
[61:52.32]I just said run because I'm about to run and my brain replaced the word.
[62:00.34]God, hold on.
[62:12.25]Shine forward.
[62:18.40]That sounds like motivational speak.
[62:24.34]Shine forward.
[62:43.37]Don't scare me like that.
[62:51.44]That rat was fast as fucking... Oh my god.
[63:08.93]Is that a clock?
[63:12.94]Resting forbearer's answer to the chosen time.
[63:15.98]It is... If it is the Lord's blessing you seek, have courage and fear no darkness.
[63:26.39]Chosen time.
[63:28.23]What time is it?
[63:40.14]The hands move.
[63:43.67]I gotta watch.
[64:02.28]Hmm.
[64:09.84]You know what's really, really interesting about all this?
[64:17.22]Are these real paintings?
[64:19.84]Or were these made specifically for the game?
[64:25.49]Think about the time and the effort that an artist went into to do this.
[64:31.62]And it lives as this set piece to create this environment.
[64:35.98]It's really cool.
[64:51.05]You don't really even think about it, right?
[64:52.51]So as I walk through these doors, somebody had to make all this.
[64:57.17]Somebody had to put all this here.
[64:58.99]That turtle was placed here, very particularly by somebody.
[65:03.59]I think we kind of forget that a lot.
[65:14.26]Sorry, but you're losing all your money.
[65:19.54]Or whatever happened to you.
[65:29.99]I'm sorry I just ruined that whole moment I was having there.
[65:33.48]I hate that.
[65:40.36]I don't like when they're under that.
[65:52.90]Hidden staircase.
[65:57.50]Must lead to a secret room or something.
[65:59.84]Shit!
[65:59.94]I don't have that device.
[66:23.09]Bunch of keys.
[66:26.95]Break this.
[66:34.94]Ashley can't kick that?
[66:59.24]God damn it.
[67:26.67]It can't get in here, right?
[68:29.01]My god, it's this one Whoa, what was the fucking door close the door close it close it close it close it close it close the door.
[68:46.02]Oh
[68:53.99]Oh shit, no.
[68:55.23]Leon!
[68:58.99]Help!
[69:33.56]Ooh.
[69:33.64]Wait, what time is it?
[70:03.70]It is exactly almost 4 o'clock.
[70:10.11]Oh, wait.
[70:13.33]Do I know what this is?
[70:14.13]I mean, hold on.
[70:26.68]Let me... I don't want to open that yet.
[70:35.97]1104.
[70:36.73]1104 o'clock.
[70:39.89]I bet that works.
[70:54.22]I didn't use one of these keys.
[70:59.04]So I missed out on something, but whatever.
[71:07.42]One hundred thousand dollars.
[71:14.79]There it is.
[71:18.59]Let me save it first.
[71:19.52]I don't think I did.
[71:36.93]Alright, 11.04 is right here.
[71:46.64]Give me a candy!
[71:47.38]Yeah, I got a blue gem.
[71:51.14]Give me a candy!
[71:51.88]What's this slot for?
[72:07.19]Alright, the other one is 1104.
[72:08.35]God damn it.
[72:25.53]By the power of the blinding light, I sentence you to hell!
[72:29.61]It works!
[72:30.43]Oh my god, it works!
[72:31.17]I forgot it worked.
[72:31.73]I thought I was making a stupid joke.
[72:49.70]1104, 1104 quickly.
[73:30.67]Am I good?
[73:31.09]Am I safe?
[73:34.74]This is the scream stream I've been waiting for.
[73:40.34]Well, just that section is just... Come on!
[73:46.91]Come on!
[74:16.57]Did they take the- Did they take the elevator?
[74:19.51]Oh, I thought they took the elevator down.
[74:21.79]I was like, why do they have intelligence like that?
[74:23.57]Alright, don't press any buttons until I know what the hell's going on in here.
[74:47.06]Okay, bird, moose, seahorse, snake.
[74:54.34]Bird, moose, seahorse, snake.
[74:57.02]Bird.
[75:02.33]Bird.
[75:05.31]Whatever, snake.
[75:14.13]That's true.
[75:15.39]It does.
[75:16.38]That's the best line of the whole game so far.
[75:19.30]This sucks.
[75:31.91]Whoa.
[75:35.97]Oh my god.
[75:36.61]This doesn't close.
[75:39.57]That person... Wait.
[75:40.81]There was a gem in that eye.
[75:43.32]How do I get it?
[75:44.05]I don't know.
[76:15.08]Okay.
[76:16.00]I need the... I get it.
[76:17.50]I get it.
[76:17.74]This sucks!
[76:29.09]That was great delivery too on that line.
[76:32.89]That was very... That was like 10 out of 10 delivery.
[76:35.31]Is that correct?
[76:45.97]I need to flip these.
[76:46.73]There we go.
[77:05.72]That was an insane puzzle.
[77:20.39]Oh, I don't even remember.
[77:21.49]I don't even have the thing.
[77:23.97]I don't even have the lantern.
[77:25.07]Did I fuck that up?
[77:28.75]Oh, God.
[77:31.21]What am I... The only one I haven't used.
[78:08.16]I just almost exited the game.
[78:17.59]Holy shit, how did I... What the hell?
[78:20.87]Come on, come on, come on.
[78:27.45]Suck.
[78:31.45]I wonder if that's harder on professional or hardcore.
[78:36.39]It's not over yet.
[78:53.78]God damn it.
[78:55.16]God damn it.
[79:10.80]Oh shit, I don't know where to go.
[79:20.54]Dude, I don't know where to go.
[79:21.40]I have no idea where to go.
[79:33.58]Where do I go?
[79:39.96]Around this way?
[79:40.76]This is wrong.
[80:08.48]It's over here, isn't it?
[80:16.63]Straight.
[80:19.69]No?
[80:23.07]Wait.
[80:24.23]It's not right here?
[80:28.48]Wait, are you serious?
[80:30.02]No, I'm going the right way.
[80:33.26]Stairs with a diamond is the right way.
[80:36.26]Oh, I knew that.
[80:58.11]Go!
[81:09.67]Thank you.
[81:12.52]Thanks for the help.
[81:19.54]Change the outfit?
[81:20.40]I will.
[81:25.60]That was terrifying.
[81:29.63]Give me a sec.
[81:30.15]I'll get you out.
[81:35.26]Helpers.
[81:41.08]Hey, try this.
[81:51.15]Oh, you need to be really sure about that, bro.
[81:52.95]I can catch you.
[81:57.53]Yeah, I think so.
[82:20.79]Oh yeah, there are the two weird predator enemies.
[82:23.13]Forgot about that.
[82:35.62]Cool.
[82:36.78]That was a long chapter.
[82:38.73]That was all the hedge maze and everything.
[82:53.80]Time for a break?
[82:54.74]No, not yet.
[82:55.86]Maybe like another half hour, 40 minutes.
[82:57.70]Maybe like an hour.
[83:05.56]So, what's become of the Amber?
[83:09.51]sorry nothing yet but my little helper is creating quite the commotion everything will work out just fine as long as you can keep your dog under control seven minutes he's a good boy predictable fine keep your mutt but don't come crying to me if you get bit
[83:53.37]How about a FaceTime call?
[84:13.17]That's such a funny concept.
[84:15.41]Imagine getting facetimed by Ada in this situation.
[84:17.65]It's like, yeah, alright.
[84:20.03]Hey, I need to do the thing where you're like, hold on, wait.
[84:22.11]I need to make the corner way bigger so I can see how ugly I am.
[84:28.46]Hey, Ada.
[84:28.66]You know what I mean?
[84:31.60]Like, we got to make sure I look alright.
[84:36.94]Okay.
[84:44.99]I have $100,000 waiting for me over here.
[84:46.45]Well, I'm about to do a cool thing.
[84:53.31]Here we go.
[84:53.69]So... We've got... She has it.
[84:54.77]She has it in her inventory.
[85:19.57]Oh well.
[85:20.29]Well, this is the ultimate shotgun.
[85:22.11]Body armor is less expensive now.
[85:24.69]Yeah.
[85:24.87]Look at all this stuff I have.
[85:26.39]I have to sell something.
[85:52.97]I'm min-max Andy right now.
[85:54.97]I have to sell something.
[85:59.67]She dropped it.
[86:00.41]They're on the ground.
[86:03.15]What?
[86:03.59]Is that for real?
[86:14.04]She dropped it.
[86:18.24]Oh, I am so glad that you said that because she didn't do that.
[86:24.46]She didn't say, hey, Leon, turn a little sack over and all she threw was the key.
[86:31.37]Alright.
[86:31.57]Well, good to know.
[86:35.47]Let's do it.
[86:41.16]Green.
[86:43.20]Purple.
[86:44.72]Red.
[86:47.02]Blue.
[86:49.76]Yellow.
[86:52.68]100,000.
[86:53.52]It's a full two times bonus.
[86:57.12]Yeah.
[86:59.02]I think this is the best possible thing you can do in the whole game, right?
[87:03.96]Is there another five slotted item?
[87:09.05]Cool.
[87:10.35]Alright.
[87:13.15]I could do this one too.
[87:15.01]I want money.
[87:16.63]I'm doing it.
[87:20.02]I want money.
[87:23.66]This can be filled in.
[87:26.02]You can do all red on this one, which would be pretty cool.
[87:31.11]Look at this.
[87:33.25]Quad bonus.
[87:36.23]Oh, yeah.
[87:42.43]That's... I don't think I've ever seen that much money in the game.
[87:45.28]Here we go. 100,000.
[87:50.55]60,000.
[87:50.63]I just got an achievement for that.
[87:52.47]Alright.
[87:52.85]Now we're gonna make some decisions here.
[87:55.69]I'm gonna sell this shotgun.
[88:12.59]It's another 152.
[88:13.51]Wait.
[88:13.93]I'm going to put that thing on.
[88:16.19]Hey.
[88:16.51]3 or 4K is 3 or 4K.
[88:17.91]You know what I'm saying?
[88:18.51]3 or 4K is 3 or 4K.
[88:20.13]I'm doing it.
[88:20.63]Yeah.
[88:20.73]Yeah.
[88:48.10]Alright, I have $292,000 to get this thing to be ridiculous.
[88:49.94]Semi-automatic shotgun.
[89:19.27]Okay.
[89:19.49]Hold on.
[89:20.03]Oh my god.
[89:20.29]It's so expensive.
[89:21.31]But it's crazy.
[89:37.75]I need some reload speed.
[89:38.95]Alright.
[89:39.39]This thing is disgusting right now.
[89:43.23]This thing is filthy.
[90:09.11]You just emptied your whole account.
[90:10.45]Yeah, into this.
[90:11.13]You don't have any ammo for it?
[90:15.72]Fix that right now.
[90:17.10]Wait.
[90:20.16]I want to put the shotgun ammo thing on.
[90:41.98]Shotgun shells craft bonus.
[90:52.24]Okay.
[90:54.48]Shotgun craft bonus is on.
[91:02.45]Six.
[91:02.67]This thing has 18 shots.
[91:14.13]Damn.
[91:14.57]Alright.
[91:15.41]I can't wait to use that thing.
[91:16.59]That thing is disgusting.
[91:23.38]It can hold 25.
[91:24.02]And I still... Remember, I still have... What?
[91:34.65]Like 20 shots in the revolver?
[91:38.15]I've got 20 shots.
[91:42.30]I am ready to kill any boss in like four hits.
[91:44.24]Alright, how we looking?
[91:47.92]Got some decent heals.
[91:51.62]I got pretty bad on ammo.
[91:55.36]But that's why I'm going to use this for a little while.
[91:59.68]I'm going to replace... Let me put this in a better spot.
[92:06.82]Alright, let's move.
[92:17.53]Outfit change.
[92:21.37]After this next little bit here.
[92:25.95]So where to?
[92:26.79]I did that.
[92:28.09]Now the idea is I have to go this way.
[92:32.11]So.
[92:33.91]Let's go.
[92:36.63]I want to go into the library.
[92:38.37]Back this way because I want to get the cube thing.
[92:47.11]Wrong way.
[92:53.15]And then it's... Come to the right.
[92:57.16]Right?
[92:57.94]Right.
[93:02.32]Ashley is literally dead.
[93:06.42]Ashley is not dead.
[93:08.15]Wait, what's this?
[93:13.93]Okay, this is game progress over there.
[93:16.49]But I don't want to do that yet.
[93:22.37]I seek a brave soul willing to dispose of that monstrosity of a knight.
[93:26.98]Be warned, as much stronger than the others, he cut down our best of the singles to defeat the strong threat in the mausoleum.
[93:47.99]I don't think I need it.
[93:48.67]I don't need it.
[94:03.75]I don't even need it.
[94:16.05]That's done.
[94:41.87]I actually do need to do this because I need ammo and there's a lot of stuff to break down here.
[94:45.92]Let me turn over here.
[95:16.42]I missed every single shot.
[95:19.69]I should get an award for that.
[95:20.82]I should be given something for that.
[96:02.14]Hi!
[96:11.92]Trying to save ammo.
[96:21.19]Ooh, right in the throat.
[96:40.49]Alright, I'm missing a couple arrows.
[96:41.77]Where are they?
[96:42.17]Am I missing arrows?
[96:53.21]Okay, so the thing is... Yellow diamond, nice.
[97:03.78]Not quite that way yet.
[97:14.02]I'm looking for that cube.
[97:18.81]Cube thing.
[97:19.81]I think it's actually upstairs.
[97:26.25]They never break, but they can go out of reach.
[97:33.28]There it is.
[97:33.62]Alright, what the hell's in here?
[97:46.88]Oh my goodness.
[97:51.52]CQBR assault rifle.
[97:55.63]Damn.
[97:57.85]This is free.
[97:58.47]It uses rifle ammo.
[98:18.27]I'm probably just going to sell this.
[98:20.29]And just put it all into the striker.
[98:23.39]That's really cool though.
[98:24.01]Alright, what else we got?
[98:30.56]I'm going all in.
[98:33.80]Yeah, that's how I play it.
[98:34.80]I don't spread it out.
[98:36.32]No, no, no.
[98:37.18]I pick one weapon and I put a million dollars into it.
[98:40.20]And it kills every enemy in one shot.
[98:43.38]Yeah, I gotta be careful.
[98:45.12]I gotta aim the shots well, but it kills every boss in three hits.
[98:49.72]Just put a million dollars into one weapon.
[98:51.70]And you don't have to worry about using other weapons.
[98:53.66]Use other weapons.
[98:55.52]Why?
[98:58.52]Having 24 shotgun shots that deal 5 million damage.
[99:03.12]Why use the rifle?
[99:03.86]Why do you need to do that?
[99:07.50]Alright, let me go out this way.
[99:13.51]There's another one up here too.
[99:19.19]It's in here.
[99:21.12]Yep, there it is.
[99:33.70]You can only kill 24 enemies.
[99:36.41]That's not accurate.
[99:37.93]Golden links, nice.
[99:41.22]Well, the boss.
[99:42.00]A boss, it has a lot of health.
[99:54.25]I could finish this right now.
[99:55.61]Or I could finish this one too.
[99:57.57]With the triple.
[99:58.09]I wonder what's worth more.
[100:04.79]I think that does it.
[100:07.33]So now I'm going to go this way.
[100:09.01]That's the game progress route.
[100:17.33]You are so bad.
[100:18.17]Why?
[100:19.76]What are we talking about?
[100:25.77]Oh, you don't want to have like an Omega shotgun?
[100:45.57]Alright.
[100:45.73]Triple.
[100:46.13]37k.
[100:46.31]That's pretty good.
[100:47.03]37.8 versus...
[101:12.56]40.
[101:12.58]Alright.
[101:13.74]It's more economically viable to do this one.
[101:16.86]It isn't?
[101:21.97]1.2 versus 1.4.
[101:22.45]This is going to affect the economy.
[101:25.51]It's fine.
[101:28.05]It's alright.
[101:42.23]Yeah, it's fine.
[101:43.43]It's fine.
[101:43.93]It's fine.
[101:44.89]This thing's worth 20k.
[101:46.99]What is it to make the shotgun ammo?
[101:49.19]I need the blue one.
[102:13.04]Let's go.
[102:13.36]16.2 damage.
[102:14.32]This thing is disgusting.
[102:26.29]It's gonna kill everything in one hit.
[102:44.81]Striker is the weakest shotgun by far.
[102:47.37]I can't... I'll be... You'll see.
[102:49.67]I'll be fine.
[102:50.53]You'll get it.
[102:56.29]I made a new save file just in case I completely fucked myself here.
[103:13.89]Magnum's already on, and Shotgun is already on, right?
[103:17.10]There we go.
[103:25.42]So we got Shotgun, melee crit hit rate, and Magnum crafting.
[103:33.87]The first Shotgun has 25 points when maxed.
[103:36.15]Yeah, but you can't go, and get the cutscene.
[103:38.93]You know what I'm saying?
[103:43.57]Boss, I make the boss drop down to one knee.
[103:46.07]The Plagas comes out.
[103:47.71]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[103:49.33]Cutscene.
[103:49.69]I think I'm going to be alright.
[104:00.30]Alright, back to it.
[104:09.49]Here and then left.
[104:15.66]Alright, we'll see, somebody said.
[104:17.06]Alright, we'll see.
[104:17.86]Okay.
[104:24.22]I gotta sit closer to my desk.
[104:26.30]I have to, like, reach over to get my drink.
[104:28.66]I'm too far away.
[104:30.40]There you go.
[104:43.92]The people want a new outfit.
[105:02.95]I'm saving ammo.
[105:07.35]Look.
[105:08.31]Look at how good I'm being.
[105:15.32]Fucking monsters.
[105:21.46]You just chose the most controversial weapon in the Resident Evil community.
[105:24.16]How do you feel?
[105:27.96]Same as I did 10 minutes ago.
[105:37.49]What do you mean?
[105:37.99]What do you mean controversial?
[105:39.67]Why is it so controversial?
[105:57.10]Ow!
[106:13.88]That was a... Oh, okay.
[106:15.22]That fucked with me.
[106:17.22]That was a really long window.
[106:18.63]I did not think that window was going to be that long.
[106:23.35]I committed, then I didn't commit, and I committed, then I didn't commit.
[106:28.27]Lost an arrow.
[106:28.87]I think I shot him in the ceiling.
[106:39.29]You must smell awful.
[106:40.27]I don't think so.
[106:58.82]Shotgun.
[107:05.70]This thing doesn't even have a full... Slugs.
[107:23.91]Nice.
[107:29.90]Ooh.
[107:31.46]Good.
[107:35.12]I have a lot of health.
[107:38.02]Alright, what's controversial about what I did?
[107:43.85]Jerma, try not to make every single chat message as mean and referring to him challenge.
[107:57.54]Now, if one of these birds just went WHAM, that would be scary.
[108:12.75]Oh, purple herb.
[108:13.83]That's max health, max ammo, and a full heal.
[108:18.65]I can't fucking believe I found one.
[108:22.61]Alright.
[108:23.81]July two years since my awakening, Master Ramon has bestowed upon me a truly righteous undertaking to improve upon the flaws of our human form, to seek perfection as observed in our anthropoidal siblings.
[108:39.88]To this cause, I shall willingly devote my life.
[108:43.60]January four years since my awakening my efforts to transfuse the black liquid into the body are at a precipice of success the womb is the key if your soul proves to be a highly malleable and adaptive subject and then a bunch of other bullshit they did or something well you can read it on your playthrough
[109:31.15]It really was like another paragraph or two.
[109:32.89]Alright, I promise I will read the notes from now on.
[109:41.09]I will read the notes.
[109:43.30]I promise.
[109:43.78]From now on.
[109:56.72]Wow, you are really slacking on your pest control.
[110:14.98]Hey.
[110:30.24]Oh my goodness.
[110:31.24]It didn't even fucking flinch.
[110:41.17]Where is this last one?
[111:10.29]Where is this motherfucker?
[111:21.53]This gave me a headache.
[111:22.53]I have a fucking headache now.
[111:34.27]Where even was he?
[112:30.53]Nice.
[112:31.57]Ow, my finger.
[112:38.96]How do I get over there?
[112:57.86]It's been like 15.
[112:59.04]I don't want you to die there because I won't be able to get the item.
[114:17.57]I don't think they stopped spawning.
[114:22.26]What the fuck?
[114:23.20]That thing was made out of stone.
[114:24.58]Get out of the fucking way.
[114:58.02]Get!
[115:00.02]Get!
[115:11.55]Okay.
[115:13.43]There's still a treasure.
[115:18.91]Where's the treasure?
[115:24.23]Get away!
[115:24.63]I'm trying to get the treasure.
[115:25.46]Fuck off.
[115:27.96]Oh my god, you're an annoying little shit, aren't you?
[116:02.48]Okay.
[116:04.62]How do I get out of here?
[116:22.03]That way.
[116:22.33]Oh, wait.
[116:22.97]I want all the items.
[116:24.33]Everything.
[116:25.43]Come on.
[116:27.87]Um...
[117:21.94]I feel like I've been walking around here for like an hour.
[117:24.88]How long have I been walking around this place?
[117:34.65]Wait, what did that just open?
[117:36.39]Did that not open this?
[117:39.33]Wait, what just happened?
[117:42.92]I didn't open that gate?
[117:46.74]There's one on the other side, isn't there?
[117:55.76]I can feel you right behind me.
[118:02.63]That way.
[118:03.94]I have to fight.
[118:05.90]Up the ladder.
[118:38.72]I'm getting so many blue um sapphires.
[119:01.37]Finally.
[119:17.47]Pretty good farm spot?
[119:19.15]Yeah.
[119:20.29]I'll take it.
[119:33.30]Got a lot of handgun ammo.
[119:41.08]How come he skipped the knight boss?
[119:44.84]Oh.
[119:47.89]Yeah, I did.
[119:48.35]I didn't mean to.
[119:48.93]I forgot.
[119:49.29]Why is it painted?
[120:16.77]Oh.
[120:18.79]That's why.
[120:24.27]You're able to go back right now?
[120:27.86]I really don't want to run through all these bugs again.
[120:29.80]Are they gone?
[120:33.04]No, they are not.
[120:41.22]I missed it.
[120:41.80]It's alright.
[120:42.24]I missed it.
[120:42.62]That's all there is to it.
[120:46.93]I missed it.
[120:50.13]It's okay.
[120:50.85]Another time.
[120:55.57]Oh shit.
[121:27.36]Shit that those I was silent before now.
[121:29.52]I'm not oh Okay, okay, I'm not quiet anymore They just they got up they're out they're out alright, this is why I this is the reason why I got this weapon I
[121:56.95]I'm fucking dead.
[121:57.87]I'm dead.
[122:07.14]Just like I fucking planned.
[122:08.54]It's gonna be ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom in the back and I'm gonna kill one in a second.
[122:11.88]Ready?
[122:14.72]Here we go.
[122:15.28]Flashbang going out.
[122:24.06]What is this?
[122:26.30]What?
[122:34.08]What happened?
[122:39.05]I couldn't shoot him.
[122:41.97]It's not hitting him.
[122:44.99]What's going on?
[122:48.49]Is the armor on the back have to be taken care of?
[122:52.25]I think it's the armor on the back is not gone.
[122:54.43]I shot the wrong one.
[122:56.98]Whatever.
[122:57.58]Alright.
[122:57.98]It's the point still stands.
[122:59.26]That would have been awesome.
[123:02.26]Okay.
[123:04.04]And dude, only use this.
[123:08.72]They can't hear this.
[123:10.06]It's silent.
[123:13.98]Just wait till they come over here.
[123:14.93]Take them out one by one.
[123:16.19]Quietly.
[123:19.35]Only headshots.
[123:20.27]Only.
[123:38.93]Can I pull him out of his head?
[124:13.75]buy it.
[124:14.89]We have been silent.
[124:17.06]We're very good.
[124:19.01]Extra bolts.
[125:09.87]I hate it.
[125:10.53]No way, dude.
[125:42.88]Somebody just threw something at me.
[125:53.56]I think they just spawned forever.
[126:05.11]They do.
[126:05.53]They just spawned forever.
[126:06.59]Okay.
[126:08.53]Well, you know what?
[126:09.89]Then... Come on, then.
[126:12.37]Come on, then.
[126:13.27]Come on.
[126:35.27]What?
[126:35.65]Why can he hear me?
[126:55.14]I don't want to use it.
[127:11.37]Oh my fucking god.
[127:12.61]Okay, alright.
[127:18.49]I gotta fucking... I gotta...
[127:24.03]I got a flashbang.
[127:27.57]Nice shotgun.
[127:28.31]I haven't even had an opportunity to use it.
[127:29.87]Don't even give me shit for that.
[127:35.03]I've got to make the Plagas come out and then unload.
[127:43.10]I'm just going in.
[127:46.90]I'm going in.
[128:38.99]I thought he was dead.
[128:43.33]I fucked it up.
[129:32.59]What the fuck just happened?
[129:35.71]I'm made out of fucking... Alright, I'm gonna do it fucking... I'm gonna do it for real now.
[129:45.77]I'm gonna do it for real and not get... Shit.
[129:49.72]Shit.
[130:19.76]Plus four, why can I not press a button on my fucking keyboard?
[130:26.56]I always press like two accidentally.
[130:59.16]Get out of my fucking way!
[131:34.10]yeah not bad right I got a beer back I shit my pants
[132:07.27]Alright, two unicorn horns.
[132:08.99]That was so scary.
[132:09.91]Does anybody else have this problem where you got 1, 2, 3, 4 on your keyboard?
[132:18.12]And from W, going from W to 3 or 2, I always end up going like this.
[132:27.38]I hit just like three of them, but I just, I can't do it.
[132:47.53]It was worth it.
[132:48.32]I could have used the mines.
[132:53.43]Nah, I made this bed.
[132:54.20]I have to sleep in it.
[133:17.01]Remember the magnum that you're never gonna use?
[133:18.45]I- I will use it.
[133:20.69]I'll use the magnum, just wait.
[133:21.51]I just, like, stabbed myself in the eye with my fingernail.
[133:27.97]I was- That's so annoying.
[133:30.63]I so badly wanted to scratch my eye with my other hand when I could have just used the right- the actual- the left hand.
[133:35.95]Just too busy gaming.
[133:38.52]No, we're good.
[133:47.19]What treats do you want?
[133:52.98]I'm good right now.
[133:53.56]I think I got everything.
[133:57.06]Alright, let's go.
[134:03.79]I also didn't even have a working knife that whole time.
[134:07.93]Turn the lights off?
[134:08.59]They're already off.
[134:46.06]Ashley!
[134:46.98]Leon, stop!
[134:47.90]No, don't come any closer!
[134:49.76]Are you hurt?
[134:53.08]Watch out!
[134:54.30]Please, do continue.
[134:59.33]Do not resist, my dear.
[135:03.93]It serves only to make your suffering all the worse.
[135:09.67]Please, please, stop!
[135:15.17]She's got a mask on.
[135:16.58]You sick fuck!
[135:18.06]Aquí nos despedimos, señor Kennedy.
[135:43.11]Yay!
[136:16.57]Hang in there, Ashley.
[136:19.03]I'm coming for you.
[136:34.81]I'll be fine.
[136:40.15]Give up the ghost?
[136:47.71]Anything down here?
[136:53.22]Oh, I remember this part is so scary.
[136:55.00]If I remember it's when.
[136:56.42]Yep, uh-huh.
[136:57.66]Oh, I hate this part.
[136:58.52]It's the sewer, right?
[137:00.62]Oh, it's the worst.
[137:03.92]It actually is awful.
[137:14.96]Talk about sticking the landing.
[137:25.65]What the hell?
[138:14.97]Get the fuck away from me!
[138:26.14]Where is it?
[138:27.02]Where?
[138:49.79]Fuck this place.
[138:52.93]Lots of blue gems though.
[138:53.99]You guys weren't lying.
[139:14.80]Don't do that.
[139:22.29]Oh, shit.
[139:23.06]Okay.
[139:52.91]They move so fast through the water, it sucks.
[140:03.28]Probably an item down here.
[140:04.10]Just gonna run.
[140:06.76]Item run.
[140:07.14]Just run.
[140:14.68]Item run.
[140:20.06]Nothing?
[140:31.23]Really?
[140:31.59]Nothing?
[140:34.01]Nothing at all?
[140:46.57]I guess a little bit of... These things heal for 100% health.
[140:53.73]If I put that keychain on.
[140:55.79]Maybe I should farm a couple here.
[141:18.95]There's another place to go.
[141:19.75]Yeah, there's an item over here.
[141:31.64]Do this IRL.
[141:35.72]Twix or payday candy bar?
[141:37.20]The people need to know.
[141:38.00]Twix every day.
[141:38.66]Twix all day, every day.
[141:47.65]Let's just...
[141:53.07]Can't get that.
[141:59.09]I really, really want that.
[142:03.24]Which, which, but left or right Twix?
[142:05.38]I open the package and close my eyes and just like spin it around and spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, and then I just take one.
[142:10.20]I can't decide.
[142:10.64]Probably drop down or something.
[142:29.52]I'll read it.
[142:30.86]Another one dead.
[142:32.02]How long has it been since I was thrown down here?
[142:34.56]The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are gone and they don't give us anymore.
[142:39.22]The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable.
[142:42.30]Most have resorted to drinking the black water.
[142:45.34]The first to turn was Hermenio.
[142:49.61]He was so weak that he couldn't even walk, but then suddenly became mad.
[142:54.51]By the time his rampage ended, two were dead.
[142:56.99]I think we shouldn't drink that dark liquid.
[143:00.13]Dear Abelardo has passed.
[143:03.83]Though he fought until the very end.
[143:06.31]The only thing I can do now is honor the bodies and pray that their souls find peace.
[143:11.14]Oh Lord, why do you test us so?
[143:18.84]Another crown.
[143:23.50]Another crown?
[143:31.04]I can do a triple in here.
[143:31.88]We'll see.
[143:40.73]Okay, I really do badly want that item down here.
[143:43.91]And I'm going to get it.
[143:56.24]There we go.
[143:57.36]Okay, finally.
[144:02.61]No, no.
[144:02.85]I already have one made.
[144:07.77]Cool.
[144:15.65]I need to repair this.
[144:39.80]Let's get this thing filled back up.
[144:59.13]Very nice.
[145:06.58]It's this part.
[145:07.74]I hate this part.
[145:10.29]I'm just going to warn everybody.
[145:11.09]I'm probably going to scream at least five to ten times during this part.
[145:14.29]There's nothing I can do about it.
[145:23.17]This is where the game turns into a granny-like.
[145:27.47]And it's a granny-like on crack.
[145:30.38]Uh-huh.
[145:31.14]It's not going to be fun.
[145:32.38]I'm very much not looking forward to this.
[145:34.52]This is probably my least favorite part of the whole game.
[145:36.46]Is this next hour or so.
[145:59.65]Yeah, well, I'll take a break.
[146:01.55]Let me just do this first.
[146:03.02]Ooh, that's a lot of gunpowder.
[146:04.80]You have anything new?
[146:06.34]Alright, let me take a look at this shit.
[146:33.35]Three blues will fit in here, and I'll be just fine.
[146:44.12]Although, is that going to be bad for later?
[146:45.72]25k.
[146:45.76]I think it's fine.
[147:01.81]7 000 so let's do let's just get these in here okay back anytime welcome got a selection of good things on sales a deal well struck
[147:26.41]You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.
[147:30.48]If you're interested in something more, well, you catch my drift.
[147:35.40]Those two rolls are gross.
[147:36.82]Alright, here's the problem.
[147:38.58]It's 30.
[147:39.12]A well-tuned weapon can make up for a... So this could have almost 50 shots in it.
[147:47.16]You don't even have the ammo to fill one magazine.
[147:49.36]I'm alright.
[147:52.02]I still got money to put into this.
[147:55.02]See, everything's going to be fine.
[148:02.24]You're the worst Resident Evil 4 player.
[148:04.03]No.
[148:06.87]I'm using a gun you don't like.
[148:08.09]Let's just get this.
[148:14.26]We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friends.
[148:25.63]I use these so often.
[148:26.49]I'm just going to use it.
[148:27.89]You know what I mean?
[148:28.45]Very cool.
[148:52.77]I could put the thing on and just use this and get a full heal.
[148:55.14]Let's top myself off.
[149:00.20]I'm gonna get topped off.
[149:21.30]Okay.
[149:22.48]I'm going to BRB.
[149:23.14]I'll be right back.
[149:25.46]And from here, I'll put on a new costume.
[149:30.31]And we'll be right back.
[149:31.55]Give me like two, three minutes.
[149:32.71]Maybe five minutes or so.
[149:33.41]See you in a minute.
[151:19.67]you
[152:27.01]Thank you.
[153:45.95]you
[154:54.71]Thank you.
[157:23.37]Thank you.
[159:11.35]Okey-dokey.
[159:12.85]How are you?
[159:22.74]Refilled my drink.
[159:25.60]Got a little bit of stretches out of the way.
[159:29.76]Move my legs a little.
[159:33.52]Preparing myself for this part coming up.
[159:40.15]I'm talking this up like crazy.
[159:41.57]Watch this not even be a big deal.
[159:45.41]No, there's no way it's not.
[159:55.98]Okay.
[159:56.88]Hello.
[159:58.64]Can you see me?
[160:00.24]Not yet.
[160:00.74]You will be in a minute.
[160:03.82]Okay.
[160:04.40]Get comfortable.
[160:09.09]Turn the...
[160:10.95]gamma down on this.
[160:14.89]Is the lighting fine on the... I'm a little orange.
[160:19.22]I mean, it kind of looks like that in here anyways.
[160:31.14]Eh, whatever.
[160:33.18]I'm good.
[160:42.13]Let me know if the audio is not any good because I had to change it for the music.
[161:00.97]How bad would you laugh if in 10 hours I can't beat the game because of the shotgun I have and I have to go back and do this and get the rifle?
[161:08.40]I would laugh out loud.
[161:09.60]Oh my god, I would laugh out loud.
[161:13.66]Outfit change?
[161:14.82]You're right.
[161:19.80]You're right.
[161:35.71]Hero or villain?
[161:42.71]Villain in cutscenes I think would be really funny.
[161:45.34]We'll do villain for now.
[162:02.10]I guess we'll do that for now.
[162:12.34]Bro, take the glasses off.
[162:21.28]No, the glasses stay.
[162:22.96]The glasses stay.
[162:25.88]I look like I'm in the fucking Night's Watch.
[162:27.71]This is going to be so distracting.
[162:30.59]I already know it.
[162:31.17]I can't wait to turn it off.
[162:31.95]I already hate it.
[162:33.53]Everything's good.
[162:42.01]Move.
[162:46.11]Looks like a Bloodborne character.
[162:47.37]Yeah, the Bloodborne mod.
[162:50.80]What is... I hear it.
[162:54.94]Where is it?
[163:00.47]There it is.
[163:07.74]Okay, no more stalling.
[163:09.68]It's time to go.
[163:11.76]But there's a treasure over here and I'm going to get it.
[163:13.56]Ooh, I think I can make a new thing.
[163:27.10]Oh, not even close.
[163:34.21]Criss Angel.
[163:47.31]Do you get partial credit for that little side quest, or do you have to get all 16?
[164:02.37]Dude, you look like a buzzard.
[164:03.79]You gotta get them all.
[164:08.02]Installation of the liquid nitrogen showers that were requested last month have been completed.
[164:12.55]Caution, liquid nitrogen is extremely hazardous.
[164:15.70]Yep.
[164:17.40]It's this part.
[164:22.43]I'm not going to scream.
[164:46.67]May, nine years since my awakening.
[164:48.97]Upon the release of this valve, black liquid shall enter my veins and circulate throughout my entire body.
[164:58.82]I expect this will be the most painful experience of my life.
[165:02.40]I await the trial with great anticipation.
[165:05.01]It is an honor to suffer through the holy labor of rebirth.
[165:08.97]The next time I awaken, it will be as a true servant of Master Ramon.
[165:13.71]I, Isidro Uriarte Talavera, make this vow.
[165:19.28]I will surpass the limitations of man and become a true servant of God.
[165:22.60]I will find the heretics and serve as their executioner, their verdugo.
[165:38.18]Gunpowder.
[165:47.42]These people are not right.
[165:50.88]Took you a long time to figure that out, Leon.
[166:04.19]Oh, a boot knife.
[166:09.07]Put that on.
[166:09.65]Put the boot knife on.
[166:10.49]Because I think I can use it to kick, right?
[166:13.07]Especially for this part.
[166:17.44]Hold on.
[166:18.30]There's more shit here.
[166:18.88]Okay.
[166:18.98]Great.
[166:50.39]Where is it?
[166:50.75]I can hear it.
[166:54.10]Oh, I'm looking right at it.
[166:57.20]Nice.
[166:57.46]Make sure I get everything.
[167:01.30]I think I've got everything.
[167:06.97]Alright.
[167:49.26]Did I waste it?
[169:09.36]Oh, it's at C. C is the worst place for that.
[169:16.61]I can't reliably press C. Let me get all the items in here first.
[169:35.44]I know there's probably a couple.
[169:49.12]Let's go.
[170:14.40]Pfft!
[170:36.67]Why did I not do this?
[170:38.55]Why did I not do this earlier?
[170:40.41]Why did I not do this earlier?
[170:43.14]Why did I not do that earlier?
[170:44.42]What's your move?
[171:01.81]Press the button!
[171:02.89]Press it, please!
[171:24.62]Get her!
[171:43.24]Oh, my God!
[171:55.10]My God!
[172:18.62]Get off me, get off me, get off me!
[172:32.11]Oh my god, press the button, please, you fucking dumbass!
[172:35.41]Press the button, where's E?
[173:01.67]Oh shit!
[173:27.57]It didn't work!
[173:29.97]Oh my god.
[173:30.97]Oh my god.
[173:31.45]I'm so fucking greedy.
[173:35.46]I'm so greedy.
[174:09.38]Fucking gross.
[174:47.23]Got him.
[174:48.57]Alright, we're not leaving yet.
[174:56.57]Imagine that on a higher difficulty.
[174:59.32]Oh, yikes.
[175:06.16]That's my least favorite part about the whole game.
[175:08.60]Not because I don't like it, but because it's just so scary and so stressful.
[175:11.28]It's a granny like this.
[175:12.10]He's just constantly running after you.
[175:14.46]Oh, yeah.
[175:17.07]There was one more nitrogen?
[175:18.45]Oh.
[175:21.88]I was panicking too much.
[175:25.04]It's not easy on hardcore.
[175:27.04]I do not envy people playing on hardcore or professional against this fight.
[175:32.23]Because it fucking sucks.
[175:39.51]I want to get in there.
[175:47.81]Uh, this door, right?
[175:59.20]Good.
[176:00.82]Ooh.
[176:02.02]I'm really glad I came in here.
[176:05.44]You made that look pretty easy.
[176:06.72]Um, the only reason why I did not lose probably three or four times there is just because I've done it before.
[176:16.51]I knew you had to do the nitrogen spray, but it still kind of doesn't matter.
[176:20.96]It's still a big scary monster running after you.
[176:31.43]Um, I should... How am I doing on items and stuff?
[176:46.96]Now, here's a little tidbit.
[176:48.34]You actually don't have to kill that thing.
[176:53.69]I think most people's first playthroughs, they'll probably just get away.
[176:59.31]You actually don't have to kill it.
[177:02.88]but I wanted to you can outweigh it yeah you just kind of run around a circle that's why I made all the flash bangs by the way beautiful now your suffering came in
[177:31.28]just as it has for our newest daughter, who has joined us in communion, and now she is of our flesh, of our blood.
[177:44.92]My faithful disciple will show her the path.
[177:49.29]Go now.
[177:50.79]Deliver to these vagrant children their salvation, as you wish.
[178:05.39]Coming back to that is just not... You're never prepared for it.
[178:17.36]I've already turned.
[178:23.85]My character has already turned.
[178:26.23]I'm completely infected at this point.
[178:31.93]Oh, you get points for actually killing it.
[178:33.14]That's cool.
[178:37.60]Pretty good score.
[178:40.48]That's pretty good.
[178:41.80]I'm not playing on hardcore, but I think that's... I think that's pretty good.
[178:44.97]I'll take a 90.
[178:50.65]Second playthrough will be hardcore.
[178:52.73]I don't think I'll ever do professional, though.
[178:55.13]You need to be next level with your aim and awareness and... I think it's like you die in like one or two hits, right?
[179:04.66]Feeling better.
[179:06.53]Yeah.
[179:07.55]Seems like it worked.
[179:10.22]Bad news?
[179:11.90]All we've done is buy you some time.
[179:14.16]There's no auto saves or anything?
[179:16.68]All too soon.
[179:17.38]Can't you only save like five times or something in professional?
[179:20.79]Something awful?
[179:21.59]Don't worry about me.
[179:23.51]Ashley is the priority.
[179:26.69]In that case, we know what we have to do.
[179:29.71]Fifteen.
[179:30.17]Then come, Sancho Panther.
[179:32.85]Let us rescue the Princess Dulcinea.
[179:35.18]You're gonna hurt yourself.
[179:37.32]This character does not belong here.
[179:39.69]Nice OC.
[179:40.01]I haven't got the red contacts in.
[180:10.12]Make your way to the surface.
[180:14.36]Everybody's so winded in the remake.
[180:29.87]October 11th.
[180:31.21]Today was the worst day of my life.
[180:32.87]It's my daughter's fifth birthday, but here I am stuck on a mangy boat heading out to some backcountry dump.
[180:40.06]If it weren't for the pay, no one would be willing to work out in the middle of nowhere.
[180:43.20]A week later.
[180:46.57]Those in the castle are always reminding us to take care during the excavation, but a few workers collapsed after inhaling some dust.
[180:54.16]There's something going on here that they're not telling us.
[180:57.30]There are too many secrets.
[180:59.06]I've started coughing, too.
[181:00.16]I should sleep.
[181:02.82]Something's really wrong with me.
[181:04.24]I threw up blood three more times today, and I'm so weak I can barely move.
[181:08.66]Shit, I never should have come down here.
[181:11.08]I came for the money, but instead I'm the one paying the price.
[181:14.18]I'm a terrible father.
[181:15.98]I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
[181:17.72]You deserve better.
[181:20.38]Since morning, my... Since morning, head don't work.
[181:23.70]Why?
[181:24.12]More blood threw up.
[181:25.12]Many insects crawling.
[181:26.38]I hear a voice.
[181:28.65]This is what I'm talking about.
[181:30.27]This is what I wanted.
[181:32.43]New day.
[181:33.53]A fine day to work.
[181:34.69]Digging brings me so much joy.
[181:36.15]I am full of happiness.
[181:37.24]I offer it all to you.
[181:38.88]Everything for you.
[181:41.02]Do you know what I mean?
[181:41.92]This is the caveman kind of talk that I was looking for.
[181:45.84]Since morning, head don't work.
[181:47.28]Okay, you're having something wrong.
[181:48.62]Yeah, your head hurts.
[181:49.76]Why?
[181:50.35]You threw up blood.
[181:51.09]I puked.
[181:51.79]There's insects everywhere.
[181:52.91]And I hear things.
[181:54.15]We don't need all this.
[181:55.67]You know what I mean?
[181:59.39]Me like small word.
[182:00.73]I've got some new items in stock.
[182:03.74]Welcome.
[182:05.00]I've got something new for you.
[182:09.72]Ooh, there's only one.
[182:11.14]How have we procured these curiosities?
[182:15.17]It's limitless, though.
[182:18.47]Should I just piss off every single person here and just save for this and just get 50 rounds in the shotgun and that's how I end the playthrough is to have 50 bullets in the shotgun at the last boss?
[182:32.21]That's so stupid.
[182:36.43]Came into some other bits and bobs too, Nate.
[182:39.85]It's 60,000 and that ticket.
[182:42.95]And I'll have 48 shots in this gun.
[182:50.64]Why not?
[182:51.32]It's stupid and fun.
[182:52.64]Might as well try it.
[182:54.46]It's 60,000.
[182:55.32]Oh, or the ticket.
[182:58.22]Oh, I thought it needed both.
[183:01.96]I can make that happen.
[183:02.75]Look at that.
[183:07.82]30 000 won't do you much good in the grave so if you kill that um that boss you get 30k that's pretty cool stranger nice I'll pay a pretty penny for that will that be all then oh I can make bullets you'll get some bang for you I don't always have this in stock stranger
[183:36.78]grenades.
[183:37.96]Nah, I'm a flashbang kind of guy.
[183:42.73]These are close.
[184:03.16]Although I should probably save it for here.
[184:05.48]What's the...
[184:08.02]five right five colors so I would need to do green purple red okay so I'll take these out don't get yourself killed by not voting in the 100k
[184:35.03]green purple I need a purple and then I could do blue yellow I see a purple we get another 100k be on the lookout for purple gem because I need one alright in the meantime what can I do I think I'm gonna save the money
[185:02.66]Although... Fix it up.
[185:11.95]I might as well just keep one of the... I've been using this a lot more frequently.
[185:15.31]Have you noticed that?
[185:16.17]I think I'm going to use... I've been using this a lot.
[185:34.25]Starting to see why this thing is really great.
[185:40.00]Is it worth 27,000?
[185:51.39]I could always sell it in the end.
[185:53.53]This could be the difference.
[185:54.29]This thing already has saved me at least two or three times with me being able to shoot and not worry about ammo.
[185:59.41]So, I think it's alright.
[186:02.86]Oh, no.
[186:15.98]I already have enough If you want to make quick work of the targets if you can live with the lack of precision that
[186:44.33]ooh okay nice red nine and then two oh handgun only try it out
[187:14.20]I need to check.
[187:15.82]We gotta check.
[187:20.95]I need to check this shit.
[187:25.32]They hide in the barrels sometimes with the skulls.
[187:41.48]I wonder if they're anywhere in the barrels.
[187:42.66]How many are there actually?
[187:48.34]Oh no, there are no hidden ones.
[187:49.86]Okay.
[187:51.64]Let's see what you can do.
[188:12.95]Can't look easy.
[188:41.13]That's it?
[188:42.75]No bonus round?
[188:45.36]Was it not fast enough?
[189:12.54]Wait for the fucking grenade guy!
[190:04.07]Where's the... That's all I fucking care about!
[190:09.59]Okay, good.
[190:10.15]Alright, I don't care about anything else.
[190:12.51]I don't care.
[190:15.22]I wanted the gold coin.
[190:17.88]There it is.
[190:18.28]We're good.
[190:22.88]We want the S and we want 100%.
[190:23.68]I need those gold coins.
[190:26.38]Alright, Punisher.
[190:29.08]Is this the one that shoots?
[190:33.42]Whoa.
[190:34.14]What the hell?
[190:36.08]Wait, that's confusing.
[190:37.04]This thing shoots through people?
[190:58.63]You looking greasy?
[190:59.45]You don't think I know that?
[191:12.53]You don't think the first person is telling me that I'm a greasy motherfucker?
[191:28.21]Fuck.
[191:29.35]I gotta wait a lot longer than that.
[191:34.69]Yeah, I gotta wait longer.
[191:35.91]It's about piercing eight.
[191:38.88]There are eight of those?
[191:41.38]Holy shit.
[191:45.14]I don't think I'm doing that.
[192:11.78]Come on, man.
[192:17.81]Come on, man.
[192:18.69]What are you talking about?
[192:19.55]It was right there.
[192:59.78]I gotta wait a long time on this one.
[193:01.96]When they line up.
[193:02.92]Ready?
[193:03.70]Right there.

[193:19.77]Thanks, Criken.
[193:20.31]Welcome, everybody.
[193:20.99]Thanks for the raid.
[193:23.67]Claim doesn't even rule.
[193:24.85]Five?
[193:25.39]It's four.
[193:26.53]Why do I keep saying five?
[193:41.62]Welcome, everybody.
[193:47.97]I didn't wait.
[193:48.55]Again.
[193:48.89]I don't like this one.
[193:55.11]I'm not a fan.
[193:55.51]I don't like this one.
[193:56.03]I have to wait too long.
[193:57.21]I hate waiting.
[193:58.26]I hate waiting.
[194:01.98]I hate this.
[194:02.28]Let me shoot.

[194:53.59]I hate it.
[194:59.01]Get out of the fucking way!
[195:35.15]How do I get to the bonus round?

[196:55.58]Oh, no.
[196:57.46]I didn't get them all.
[197:00.52]Which one did I miss?
[197:02.94]Shit.
[197:04.50]I wonder which one I missed.
[197:05.42]I didn't see it.
[197:14.06]I'm one of the pirates.
[197:15.98]Wait, restart.
[197:18.80]What's the condition on this one?
[197:24.96]10 shots or less.
[197:25.80]Okay, let's try it.
[197:29.08]Three.
[197:56.00]Four.
[198:00.82]Five.
[198:05.86]Oh, come on, dude.
[198:07.00]You gotta be shitting me.
[198:09.88]That was bait.
[198:10.64]No, what are you doing?
[198:11.62]No, I'm just shooting.
[198:12.40]I fucking hate these.
[198:27.28]Gonna eat my fucking microphone.
[199:14.94]How do I do that one?
[199:16.40]I guess it's bait.
[199:17.60]Alright, so some of these are bait.
[199:34.88]That's three, right?
[199:41.38]Four.
[199:46.20]Five.
[199:51.08]What are you talking about, video game?
[199:53.61]Are you on fucking crack?
[199:55.69]I shot it directly in the face.
[200:04.48]Did it hit the ceiling?
[200:13.45]What the fuck?
[200:14.57]Perfect.
[200:23.47]Perfect.
[200:45.69]Put your head down, put your head down, put, get down!
[201:11.82]That's it, right?
[201:12.42]I gotta have gotten it right there.
[201:13.60]That's it, right?
[201:15.19]Yeah!
[201:17.25]Try this one more time.
[201:19.57]What the fuck?
[201:43.42]How did it hit the guy?
[201:45.33]It was the fucking triangle.
[202:27.11]Fuck!
[203:00.12]And that would have been 100%.
[203:00.86]It would have been every single fucking one.
[203:07.12]I'm done.
[203:08.30]2-1 or should I just go 3?
[203:40.68]That's actually kind of good.
[203:41.44]I would have loved that earlier.
[203:45.68]Ooh.
[203:59.91]That kind of sucks.
[204:07.02]Another rare.
[204:08.06]Epic.
[204:09.99]30% off body repairs.
[204:11.47]That's really good.
[204:12.31]But is it actually 30% or is it full of shit?
[204:14.43]Because the other one was bad.
[204:15.53]Dude, Ashley is dying and you're buying gumballs.
[204:22.99]I mean, I gotta relax a little.
[204:28.05]Rare.
[204:37.55]100% recovery item?
[204:39.47]Resale value?
[204:44.71]Like, if I... Herbs and stuff?
[204:46.69]Why would I sell herbs?
[204:54.16]Looks cool, though.
[204:55.06]Feels cool.
[204:59.04]Nice.
[204:59.30]That's it, right?
[205:05.48]He scared the shit out of me.
[205:06.74]I forgot he was here.
[205:08.46]I just saw a guy with a gun walking towards me and I was like, what is happening right now?
[205:14.80]I love the shooting range.
[205:17.15]I love it.
[205:18.55]I don't like that other gun though.
[205:21.81]Green, red, yellow, herb combo sells for $20,000 with that trinket?
[205:29.09]What do you mean?
[205:29.79]Hold on.
[205:34.97]Where's the typewriter?
[205:36.15]Let's take a look.
[206:08.19]Alright, let's I'm curious.
[206:11.84]Welcome got a selection of good things on sale stranger.

[206:25.16]So this is normally 2000.
[206:25.84]Alright, so let me take it off and see what it does.
[206:37.75]Uh, I think, yeah, the gunpowder one's, I think, the one I want.
[206:40.82]Melee.
[206:42.52]Alright, get this off.
[206:48.36]I'll keep the shotgun one on.
[206:58.99]I'll just keep the chicken one on, maybe.
[207:01.71]Yeah, just keep the chicken.
[207:02.65]If I run into an egg, I run into an egg.
[207:07.37]Beetle, chicken, fish.
[207:08.15]Yeah, but there's no reason to have this on right now if I'm not going to be near the merchant.
[207:26.76]So now let's see.
[207:28.42]What does that sell for now?
[207:31.04]Yeah.
[207:31.74]So that's pretty cool.
[207:35.05]I think I'm gonna go okay very very fun very cool what an exciting experience let's go a little hard for me to put my faith in someone who used to work for umbrella so you heard huh
[208:01.39]Ooh, stuff.
[208:01.85]Oh yeah, this is a mine shaft.
[208:31.98]Don't you actually ride a minecart?
[208:36.12]I definitely shouldn't use this then.
[208:37.62]I'll lose all the bolts.
[208:40.74]What are we doing on crafting?
[208:41.58]Can I craft anything?
[208:48.83]If I'm going to use it, I'm going to use it.
[208:54.27]I'm seeing the light on this one.
[208:57.59]Dynamite has been relocated to the M4 storeroom.
[209:01.97]When using explosive cave-ins or a frequent occurrence, watch out.
[209:05.48]Okay.
[209:09.96]Cool.
[209:16.27]That's going to be a fun puzzle.
[209:19.79]Looking forward to it.
[209:32.13]Crossbow's been carrying these last few chapters.
[209:34.09]It actually kind of has.
[209:36.43]I talked a lot of shit about it.
[209:38.03]Oh, we're going over.
[209:52.00]This looks really, really nice down here.
[209:55.58]Oh, shit.
[209:56.40]Okay.
[209:58.40]Okay.
[209:59.88]Time for this thing to shine.
[210:01.23]Are you ready?
[210:01.73]Ready?
[210:03.17]This is where this shines.
[210:04.43]Come on over here.
[210:05.05]Run over here.
[210:05.57]Do what you want to do.
[210:06.35]Watch this.
[210:09.11]Hello.
[210:09.41]He fucking just clocked me in the head with the shovel.
[210:26.56]I would be out for a...
[210:36.05]What up?
[210:36.91]What's up now, huh?
[210:43.65]Ow.
[210:49.83]Stop.
[210:51.01]How many fucking bombs do you guys have?
[210:54.36]Put that down.
[210:55.54]Put it down.
[210:56.82]Put it down.
[210:58.24]Put...
[211:29.02]Oh, she's just punching.
[211:42.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[212:06.49]I gotta press a button or something, right?
[212:27.01]Alright.
[212:29.47]Where's the... There's gotta be a lever or something.
[212:46.26]Another chainsaw?
[212:57.20]Why would you knock her out of that?
[213:02.95]Ow.
[213:04.67]Shotgun is fucking stacked.
[213:10.45]Stacked.
[213:15.46]This way?
[213:20.53]Do we have to do, you know, throw him up there?
[213:26.31]Here we go.
[213:35.38]Let's just have him.
[214:03.33]Edgar Allan Poe looking at us.
[214:26.33]Shit, broken.
[214:30.81]How do I...
[214:37.41]He just... Alright.
[214:39.05]Dynamite.
[214:39.93]Alright, let's go walk around.
[214:41.19]Jeremy, can you pause the stream?
[214:43.95]I gotta go to bed.
[214:48.75]Um... That's a good nap.
[215:12.01]OK, time to walk around and make sure I didn't miss anything.
[215:14.91]Which there's a bunch of shit.
[215:19.23]Yep.
[215:22.15]Very cool.
[215:28.02]Just screenshot the stream.
[215:29.40]Alright, there are actually a couple of few things I missed.
[215:46.31]Up there.
[215:46.89]Okay, there's one over this way.
[215:51.74]Herb.
[215:53.90]Yep.
[215:54.08]There's my bolts back.
[216:03.13]I hear one of those things.
[216:05.15]Where is it?
[216:17.66]The other treasure is up there.
[216:19.98]Alright, let's get out of here.
[216:37.94]I missed the legendary loot.
[216:45.18]Oh, I think I got everything.
[216:49.87]I have to go around and drop down
[217:18.36]Alright, see you in like an hour when I finish this.
[217:24.01]That's not a puzzle.
[217:24.79]That's not a puzzle.
[217:29.15]Jesus.
[217:31.47]Ah!
[217:37.48]Imagine seeing that as... I didn't know it was going to roll all the way.
[217:46.46]I thought it was going to cave in.
[217:50.49]Wait a minute.
[218:04.06]Why did it take arrows from me?
[218:07.34]I had 12 before.
[218:13.02]Okay, I just almost freaked out.
[218:14.28]I was going to say, you don't have to do the whole thing over, right?
[218:18.32]Okay, there we go.
[218:20.17]I gotta get all the stuff again.
[218:21.71]This one.
[218:27.81]And it's hanging up here.
[218:30.37]That one.
[218:37.66]And there's one across there.
[218:39.70]That way.
[218:45.16]Where is it?
[218:45.92]No, it's in that little quarter.
[218:54.94]It's my favorite tea.
[218:57.02]I really like green tea.
[218:58.72]Oh, no.
[219:00.71]I already did this one.
[219:01.63]It's up here.
[219:03.39]I like green.
[219:05.77]I like... Um... I like white tea.
[219:25.96]Actually, black tea kind of has a very distinct kind of bitter flavor that I don't really love.
[219:32.14]I love it when it's... Here's the thing.
[219:34.68]I know a lot of you probably are going to agree with this and we're just going to talk about it for a second.
[219:39.35]If I make... If I brew black tea and I put sugar in it or I sweeten it somehow, I don't even... It doesn't... It's different than if you were to buy an iced tea from the store and drink it as just a sweetened iced tea.
[219:54.68]It tastes way better to me
[219:57.01]And I can never figure out why.
[219:59.83]Brewing black tea and putting sugar in it still tastes kind of bitter with sugary sweetness flavor.
[220:05.42]But getting an iced tea like a brisk or like a Lipton iced tea or something, it tastes different.
[220:13.38]Is it just more sugar and just more lemon?
[220:21.13]Green tea is my favorite though, for sure.
[220:23.83]I love green tea.
[220:40.36]Need to heal.
[220:42.96]I was like, where's my bass?
[221:00.85]I ate that two hours ago.
[221:03.77]Did I tell you guys it just kind of reminded me?
[221:05.23]I was like, where is it?
[221:05.87]Where's my bass?
[221:06.45]Where's my bass?
[221:07.83]I won it!
[221:08.21]Wait, so what happened to my bass?
[221:10.15]Just unlocked a memory when I was younger.
[221:11.85]Uh... I wanna say when I was like... Maybe like... Late teens, I wanna say?
[221:20.66]I remember I scratched a scratch ticket.
[221:24.70]And won a- I won a couple hundred dollars on a scratch ticket.
[221:28.54]When I was like, I don't know, maybe... I'd have been like 19 or something.
[221:32.66]And I was like, HOLY SHIT DUDE FUCKING 300 BUCKS!
[221:36.93]And I kept looking for that money for like a year and later.
[221:40.49]I was like, no, wait, I got money because I won that.
[221:42.57]I scratched off that fucking 300 bucks.
[221:44.49]I got money.
[221:45.01]And it was like, no, you don't.
[221:49.65]You don't.
[221:50.89]It's been spent.
[221:51.93]It was spent.
[221:52.43]It's been like two years, dude.
[221:54.07]You didn't.
[221:54.43]The money's not there anymore.
[222:03.50]You spent it all on Diablo II.
[222:08.25]After you, I insist.
[222:10.07]Such a gentleman.
[222:12.83]I wasn't even looking and it scared me.
[222:14.57]I was reading chat.
[222:27.25]Now you owe me.
[222:28.45]Please, heads up!
[222:32.66]Oh shit, I forgot about this.
[222:34.90]This is gonna be awful.
[222:37.29]I forget there's a strategy here.
[222:38.95]This is an unfair tag team.
[223:24.63]I just... I'm dead, dude.
[223:33.70]I'm dead.
[223:36.62]I'm looting the fucking area.
[223:44.95]I get stomped.
[223:46.47]Pay attention, dude.
[223:49.73]I got my head bitten off.
[223:52.14]Oy, oy, oy.
[223:54.40]I have to do that because I just... I'll forget to pick up his stuff.
[223:58.95]Let's go.
[223:59.53]What?
[224:11.31]Oh, dump him, dump him, dump him, dump him, dump him.
[224:22.44]Get him to chase!
[224:23.00]Get him to chase!
[224:42.22]Over here!
[224:46.04]Get over here!
[224:49.74]Come over here!
[224:58.76]Luis, get him over.
[225:14.80]Come over this.
[225:15.56]What are you doing?
[225:25.40]Why does he keep moving?
[226:25.00]Oh, fuck you!
[226:38.23]Alright, there's one.
[226:44.05]There's one.
[226:48.39]Get... Get off!
[227:05.34]Where you going?
[227:09.02]Where is he?
[227:16.00]Where'd he go?
[227:16.40]It moved.
[227:34.96]That's a lot of dynamite, man.
[227:41.96]What do you want?
[227:55.41]Just for you.
[227:57.01]Shoot it.
[228:11.51]No, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.
[228:13.07]What am I doing?
[228:15.46]Shit, I was supposed to drop him.
[228:21.62]I... It was a stupid indicator popped up on the screen.
[228:27.76]No, I... Stop shooting him.
[228:37.67]Stop shooting him.
[228:38.55]Let him get into the...
[228:44.28]Stop shooting and let him get into the middle.
[228:56.74]No, he's getting out again.
[229:02.23]Stop shooting.
[229:03.05]Stop shooting.
[229:26.97]RIP items.
[229:39.58]RIP items?
[229:40.28]I don't... I don't get anything for, uh... Well, here's the argument I'm gonna make to you.
[229:55.48]I probably would have gone through a bunch of this ammo.
[230:00.18]Right?
[230:00.60]So, technically, I saved ammo.
[230:02.74]But I didn't get, like, $20,000, $30,000.
[230:03.76]Oh, well.
[230:04.24]It's alright.
[230:16.77]I actually have a ton of ammo now.
[230:27.21]That everything.
[230:29.87]Nope.
[230:35.20]That's everything.
[230:42.70]Come on.
[230:44.21]That's fun.
[230:50.29]How's it look?
[230:59.36]They only drop rubies.
[231:01.18]That's kind of sad because I think I need a ruby.
[231:06.25]Purple gem and amethyst doesn't drop from either one of those two, right?
[231:09.59]Because that would actually be bad.
[231:11.49]I would actually restart for that.
[231:16.99]It's random.
[231:18.55]Yeah.
[231:27.87]Illuminato's pendant.
[231:28.75]Saying that sentence winded him.
[232:02.78]You just fought two giants.
[232:05.62]Yeah.
[232:07.00]An hour ago.
[232:18.13]Time moves much differently in this game.
[232:20.51]I think we're here for like six or seven days, aren't we?
[232:24.14]And it's kind of each chapter is like another day.
[232:27.82]I'm making all of that up.
[232:33.98]You're not suggesting we ride this thing?
[232:36.38]Do you see any other way?
[232:47.97]He hasn't pissed one time.
[232:49.13]Oh.
[232:53.68]You don't know that?
[232:54.20]Hmm.
[233:09.01]Need a yellow herb.
[233:11.03]Very badly.
[233:22.48]Let's go.
[233:22.88]Give us a push, Sancho.
[233:25.58]What were you calling, Sancho?
[233:26.74]Let's get an ammo on this.
[233:31.50]There.
[233:32.16]It's moving.
[233:33.34]This should speed things up a bit.
[233:35.25]I can't believe I'm doing this.
[233:36.91]Hey, we're in a hurry, right?
[233:39.57]That was a little shit drop.
[233:49.66]Wasn't even scary.
[233:51.02]Oh, you have to lean.
[233:57.35]Why is it going to flip?
[234:00.31]Why are we going so far off the rails?
[234:01.93]We're going to crash.
[234:19.00]Dude, dude!
[234:34.05]Shot the gun out of his hand.
[234:35.15]Please shake them off.
[234:49.09]Jesus I'm on it
[235:21.03]What was that guy doing?
[235:32.92]Why are we going so slow?
[236:00.21]Got it.
[236:02.39]That was fun.
[236:05.43]That was pretty sick.
[236:06.35]Hold on.
[236:06.63]I hear... Like a...
[236:52.38]Whoa.
[236:54.30]What?
[237:05.55]Watch this.
[237:11.59]Don't ever hold your hand out like that.
[237:13.75]You should have been behind your back or something, man.
[237:27.90]Any eggs in here?
[237:42.16]Hold on.
[237:43.18]Is that it?
[237:45.26]There's something else over here.
[237:49.40]Besides this.
[237:49.99]There's something else, right?
[237:54.43]No.
[237:54.61]Wait.
[237:54.95]Can I climb that?
[237:55.49]No.
[237:57.41]Okay.
[237:59.01]Pretty cool.
[238:00.71]I got all my arrows back.
[238:09.23]Alright, cart ride part two.
[238:13.53]Alright, let's go.
[238:19.29]Ugh, not this again.
[238:26.36]Play Donkey Kong music?
[238:27.44]Actually, it would be kind of funny.
[238:28.86]I can't really alt-tab right now, though.
[238:35.41]Did they die from that?
[238:47.88]Or is it... I don't know.
[239:00.15]I just wanted to see.
[239:10.52]They really just throw you right in, huh?
[239:25.59]What the fuck?
[239:32.01]Are you shitting me?
[239:40.06]I feel like that's another player playing Mario Kart or something.
[240:13.69]Ugh!
[240:55.36]What's wrong with Luke?
[240:57.40]What's wrong with him?
[241:01.74]Why is he just lifeless right now?
[241:29.25]We're good.
[242:07.66]That didn't work.
[242:08.48]Kitchen Nightmare sounds... It really kinda works.
[242:38.69]That's so stupid.
[242:42.21]Wait a minute.
[242:43.51]There is a jewel over there.
[242:46.39]How do I get over there?
[243:11.97]How do I get over there?
[243:22.80]Shit.
[243:24.42]Did I miss it?
[243:31.13]Maybe from here?
[243:31.67]Oh well.
[243:42.38]Maybe it's under me.
[243:44.94]I didn't even see it.
[243:46.40]I missed it.
[243:51.08]You know what?
[244:03.05]It's the sound effect for me.
[244:04.57]It's just a loud sound.
[244:07.23]Unexpected loud sound effects.
[244:10.37]Maybe I can get it.
[244:13.17]Wait a minute, what's down here?
[244:23.86]I definitely can get it from here.
[244:24.84]I knew it!
[244:31.81]Stay sharp!
[244:33.27]These guys have camouflage!
[244:48.75]Destroy all the entrances to the hive.
[244:53.90]Too many have lost their lives in the never-ending swarm of insects.
[244:56.58]It's a plague.
[244:57.68]Destroy the entrances to their gigantic hive.
[244:59.44]You got it.
[245:28.33]Alright, entrances.
[245:29.84]That's an entrance right there.
[245:34.52]Is it not?
[245:36.86]Oh my god, no.
[245:38.24]Wait, is it?
[245:38.78]That's it.
[245:41.63]Yeah, it is.
[245:46.09]That's it.
[245:46.77]Am I wasting ammo right now?
[246:04.33]Body armor's not looking great.
[246:37.96]Oh, Sapphire.
[246:47.96]Alright, we need to jump up this.
[246:51.64]Can we not jump up this together?
[246:52.58]Are you kidding me?
[247:06.33]What the duck is that?
[247:08.71]I don't know.
[247:09.01]Good question.
[247:13.28]I hate insects.
[247:15.14]Take care of them for me, would you?
[247:16.52]Not bad, right?
[247:18.76]What is... You know what to do.
[247:34.65]That's not... That's gone now, dude.
[247:58.15]Hooray!
[247:58.97]What happened to Ashley?
[248:03.75]Um... That's a very, very good question.
[248:07.95]She was taken and then... I kind of lost track after I started doing the gumball machine over and over again.
[248:15.29]But... We'll be good.
[248:35.35]There is that over there.
[248:40.20]There's a gem or jewel over there somewhere.
[248:44.60]That was not very good.
[248:52.09]I could do that better.
[248:53.53]There's all kinds of gems and jewels.
[248:57.07]That one's better.
[248:58.49]Use that one.
[249:12.77]That's a weird place for that.
[249:13.71]I don't know why it's here.
[249:14.39]Maybe I have to run back with a bunch of things attacking me.
[249:23.52]Yes.
[249:30.94]Can I destroy the hive?
[249:31.86]Why am I still getting attacked?
[249:51.75]Ooh.
[249:57.29]What's in here?
[250:00.72]Oh!
[250:03.14]You're welcome.
[250:03.58]I could buy a bunch of these.
[250:04.94]Okay.
[250:25.68]Look at how many sapphires I have.
[250:26.86]Holy shit.
[250:32.66]I'll do two blue.
[250:44.05]Put the one green in here.
[250:45.13]Change clothes.
[250:51.51]I will in like six or seven days.
[250:59.54]Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave.
[251:03.84]Stranger!
[251:04.50]Ooh, I'll pay a pretty penny for that.
[251:11.81]Your weapons are in good hands, mate.
[251:15.01]I'll see you right.
[251:19.17]It doesn't get any better than that.
[251:21.85]It's a veritable work of art, mate.
[251:24.75]Will that come back any time?
[251:31.95]Now the quest to make a shitload of shotgun ammo begins.
[251:37.42]Okay.
[251:43.22]I want to make sure I have my shotgun thing on.
[251:49.01]Gunpowder is the case that I have on.
[252:01.28]Go for it.
[252:05.13]Come on!
[252:08.98]Come on!
[252:09.64]21.
[252:14.16]The quest to get this to 50.
[252:20.50]Welcome.
[252:21.60]Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger.
[252:39.11]Don't get yourself killed now.
[252:58.12]Welcome.
[252:59.32]What can I interest you in?
[253:03.92]Ruby's all rubbish.
[253:05.00]It makes no difference.
[253:06.50]Pleasure doing business with you.
[253:10.18]You're wearing a Zoolander outfit.
[253:23.81]Dude, just wait until I put 48 rounds in this thing.
[253:30.16]I'm going to shoot 50 times in a row at the last boss and it's going to be fucking hilarious.
[253:37.84]I'm going for the comedy run at this point.
[253:45.71]Let me kill this.
[253:46.81]Can I not get up there?
[253:55.99]I don't think I can do it.
[253:56.76]Oh well.
[254:11.22]Oh well.
[254:20.61]Aren't you cheating at this game?
[254:24.87]I turn unlimited ammo on when I have trouble.
[254:29.48]So it's like half the game.
[254:32.34]Unlimited ammo and invincibility usually is turned on every few minutes or so.
[254:38.26]It makes me feel better.
[254:40.58]Be straight with me for once.
[254:43.04]Los iluminados.
[254:45.96]I was working for her.
[254:48.22]See?
[254:48.78]There you go.
[254:50.21]Helping the two of you doesn't make up for it.
[254:52.79]I know that.
[254:54.37]But still, I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
[254:58.87]In that case, you better get serious.
[255:04.40]Harsh words for a squire.
[255:05.98]How'd he get the outfit?
[255:06.76]I, um... I paid an extra ten dollars.
[255:10.64]Where the hell
[255:17.05]Fresh air is calling our names.
[255:19.65]For free!
[255:22.31]Gus, if we made it all this way, you know it means we're almost... Almost what?
[255:34.53]Luis!
[255:40.01]Long time no see, rookie.
[255:43.43]Major Krauser?
[255:45.31]What the hell?
[255:46.83]Why?
[255:47.13]For covering stolen goods.
[255:52.99]And killing a few rats along the way.
[255:57.89]Easy work.
[256:00.63]Ashley, it was you who got you quick.
[256:05.65]Didn't I teach you?
[256:07.69]Knives are faster.
[256:10.03]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[256:13.81]Oh yeah, you fast enough for that?
[256:44.82]Ow!
[256:45.04]Ooh!
[256:45.40]Getting parried!
[257:17.25]Oh, you got parried five times in a row, man.
[257:20.37]I can understand.
[257:29.48]What happened was unforgivable.
[257:51.83]This is a fun fight with the parry.
[258:23.82]Ugh, no.
[258:24.16]I got it for ya.
[258:55.87]I go, smoking is bad for you.
[258:58.69]Don't smoke.
[259:01.31]I don't do it.
[259:32.71]Shit.
[259:35.83]Crazy.
[259:36.25]A lot of points.
[259:46.48]Oh, the exclusive upgrade, right?
[259:50.18]Ooh, parry all of Jack Krauser's five consecutive attacks.
[259:57.78]That's pretty good, too.
[260:05.52]I was wondering.
[260:06.04]I felt like I got those up pretty well.
[260:20.61]You were a fine night, Don Quixote.
[260:26.47]I gotta pee again.
[260:33.42]I'll be right back.
[263:39.02]I'm back.
[263:40.46]Do you guys like that I do that now?
[263:43.52]I give the little... So it's not so crazy.
[263:50.67]I like somebody said he saw the cigarette and needed to have a smoke break.
[263:53.61]And we just really had to pee.
[263:55.83]We drank a lot of water.
[263:58.40]Trying to stay hydrated.
[263:59.34]Well, not a lot.
[264:00.04]That's not necessarily true.
[264:13.72]Okay.
[264:20.69]You don't have to hide it.
[264:21.61]We know you want to cry.
[264:23.17]What do you mean?
[264:29.32]Oh, because of... Oh, I see what you're saying.
[264:42.39]Costume change?
[264:42.99]Yeah, I'll put Hero on.
[264:46.94]Let me... I just saved her, right?
[264:50.57]Give me a sec.
[265:11.77]Might as well just try them all.
[265:18.81]We haven't seen Ashley yet, so... Just make it normal?
[265:28.70]We gotta see all the costumes.
[265:33.02]Oh, hold on.
[265:33.42]You can't see.
[265:34.64]There you go.
[265:37.60]We gotta see them all.
[265:44.76]It's not like we're not going to do this.
[265:47.32]After we play this for like a chapter... I'll take it off.
[265:55.53]We'll go back to the... Actually, I like this one.
[265:57.75]This one's actually good.
[266:01.89]They're all good for different reasons.
[266:03.53]They're all fun.
[266:08.84]Alright, let's go.
[266:10.18]Sunglasses are going to be taken off.
[266:14.18]I know shocking.
[266:15.89]Let's go.
[266:40.17]No sound of shit.
[266:42.67]You won't get away with this Krauser.
[266:46.74]Geez.
[266:57.74]I feel like I should have a sword.
[266:58.81]Alright, there's lots of actually there.
[267:04.39]I gotta loot this whole area.
[267:05.69]This whole place.
[267:13.00]There's one other herb over here, right?
[267:14.58]Okay.
[267:24.71]You're a rogue with a crossbow and daggers.
[267:27.97]Actually, kind of true.
[267:30.36]I do have a crossbow.
[267:31.20]That's right.
[267:31.62]I am playing the part.
[267:46.99]Tonight with a shotgun.
[267:49.41]And a cell phone.
[267:50.53]Turn on some fantasy music.
[268:15.46]Oh my... That was jarring.
[268:20.00]Someone help me recover a stolen jewel snatched by a thieving crow.
[268:24.73]I bet it can be found in the vile thing's nest.
[268:28.29]It's an heirloom.
[268:29.17]Okay.
[268:37.47]Even the very sight of his image makes my skin crawl.
[268:39.95]Do me a service and find some way to deface the portrait of him in the room shown in the photograph, will you?
[268:47.01]I'm not particular about how you do it.
[268:48.30]Hitting it with something might do the trick.
[268:53.86]Where is that?
[269:06.09]Throne room?
[269:25.34]Leon looks like he's got lost on his way to the Renaissance Faire.
[269:29.90]Welcome.
[269:31.16]Welding.
[269:32.08]What can I do you for?
[269:34.54]Still can't do anything.
[269:35.69]Suit yourself, stranger.
[269:40.89]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[269:42.51]Did I get everything over there?
[269:43.59]Did I get everything over there?
[269:46.53]There's the clock tower.
[269:51.95]Hang in there, Ashley.
[269:55.30]Shit, I'm going back.
[269:56.46]I look pissed.
[270:22.94]Sorry Ashley, this items.
[270:32.04]Okay, that was worth it.
[270:36.74]You know what I kind of want to do?
[270:41.14]Do you remember all the way back in the very beginning of the game where the... Where's the village?
[270:51.37]The actual village?
[270:52.29]Village?
[270:59.83]I'm kind of very far away from it, aren't I?
[271:01.73]There's a couple of locked... It's gone.
[271:04.43]Is it gone forever?
[271:05.12]It's locked off.
[271:07.26]Shit.
[271:07.46]Because there's a couple of locked drawers.
[271:14.08]That are in the very beginning of the game.
[271:15.36]And I was like, maybe I want to go back and get those.
[271:19.39]There are locked drawers back in the beginning.
[271:24.77]They probably just have gold bars in them, I'm assuming.
[271:40.12]Check your drawers.
[271:47.11]Okay.
[271:59.25]Okay.
[272:05.90]A lot of treasure in here.
[272:16.95]All the side missions are back in the castle.
[272:46.85]The painting one seems very easy, so why not?
[272:49.52]Sorry, Ashley.
[272:50.38]I'm going back again.
[272:53.42]Sorry, Ashley.
[272:54.24]I keep having second thoughts.
[272:57.42]I'll do the painting one.
[273:01.89]The night one is cool, too.
[273:11.24]Don't skip the cigarette minigame.
[273:33.49]Not down here.
[273:34.35]Oh, fuck.
[273:35.53]I just was on autopilot.
[273:39.60]There's an achievement for riding back and forth?
[273:49.15]I'm really very indecisive ever since I put this fucking costume on.
[274:05.84]Alright, so where are these requests?
[274:11.90]Duel thief.
[274:12.57]I already did that.
[274:16.33]Defeat the strong threat, the knight.
[274:19.29]Maybe I'll do the knight.
[274:32.35]And then this one too.
[274:33.89]I'll do the knight and I'll do the painting one.
[274:41.72]Jewel thief takes like two minutes.
[274:46.64]How come I rode down and immediately rode back up?
[274:48.66]Well, that's because I was confused and I was not supposed to go down.
[274:53.08]I was supposed to go that way.
[274:56.80]Prone room one is a minute too.
[274:58.30]Yeah.
[275:01.72]We go this way.
[275:02.34]Can you stop being confused?
[275:10.06]Uh, that's hard.
[275:13.06]Considering that's baked into my personality.
[275:17.33]And I don't think there's ever going to be a time when I can stop that.
[275:22.15]It's kind of who I am at this point.
[275:25.01]So, I think I have accepted that.
[275:30.68]Understandable, yeah.
[275:36.80]Alright, where's the throne room?
[275:40.84]Courtyard, wine cellar.
[275:42.10]There's a lot of stuff here.
[275:46.35]Oh, yeah.
[275:46.99]I mean, this is all going to get locked off, so I might as well just do a little bit.
[275:53.37]I have keys.
[275:56.95]Treasury.
[275:59.21]So what's faster?
[276:01.29]Taking the train back and going this way or just walking from here?
[276:20.57]Alright, looking for locked drawers.
[276:26.66]I know there's one or two over here.
[276:32.40]Okay.
[276:32.64]Is this the Grand Hall?
[276:41.99]How did I not open this?
[276:51.32]Alright, courtyard.
[276:52.20]There's one in the courtyard.
[277:00.28]Someone help me recover a stolen jewel by thieving crow.
[277:03.51]There's a nest in the courtyard.
[277:06.67]I'm gonna go to the courtyard first.
[277:21.51]Got it?
[277:22.71]Is that right?
[277:24.80]I just saw a huge bird.
[277:27.92]Alright, nest.
[277:42.59]There's apparently a nest here.
[277:51.50]broken away from me what oh there it is alright scratched emerald don't mind if I do that's that one the knight is in the mausoleum
[278:21.35]I failed that one.
[278:24.33]Alright, so this one, where is this?
[278:25.43]This mausoleum and then this weird throne room.
[278:31.35]Audience chamber?
[278:38.12]Audience chamber, right?
[278:45.16]Ooh.
[278:45.36]Ooh.
[278:51.88]It's the far right.
[278:52.86]Is it over here?

[279:04.95]Yeah, there's a lot of shit over here.
[279:33.46]Okay.

[279:40.48]I want to check.
[279:40.94]I got to check.
[279:46.73]This way is open now?
[279:49.05]No, I need two.
[279:51.01]No!
[279:51.45]Damn it.
[280:02.10]Okay, there's a bunch of shit in here.

[280:13.96]100k.
[280:14.12]100,000.
[280:28.11]It's already worth coming back here for the 100k.
[281:07.84]Alright.
[281:11.27]No, my bolt.
[281:15.51]This game is freaking legit.
[281:16.83]Yeah, it is.
[281:24.69]Nice.
[281:25.86]Extravagant clock.
[281:26.86]What else is in here?
[281:37.28]There it is.
[281:42.86]Nice.
[281:43.12]Big money coming up.
[281:52.05]The bolts are not real bolts.
[281:54.19]It's in the wall.
[281:55.09]Now down here.
[281:55.95]Ooh.
[281:58.67]Alright.
[282:01.64]There's a bunch of... I'm just going to go through this.
[282:03.02]This game is bussing.
[282:06.54]Yeah.
[282:26.48]Nobody said that.
[282:27.84]Yeah, they did.
[282:28.22]I just read it.
[282:31.38]Somebody said it.
[282:40.01]Is the knight down here?
[282:40.91]I'm going to run into the knight, aren't I?
[283:07.44]I'm good.
[283:10.58]Now from here.
[283:14.28]I could go this way.
[283:51.04]There's a treasure down here.
[283:52.08]Let me just see where it is.
[283:54.22]Is it up or down?
[283:58.56]Block chest or something, maybe?
[284:15.71]It's... He's totally baked doing side quests.
[284:20.98]Where's this treasure?
[284:50.10]I should never come down here.
[284:54.93]God damn it.
[284:55.53]Alright, I need to go back or something because there's like a treasure here, but I'm just getting stuck.
[285:13.70]What was that?
[285:14.58]I shot you in the head.
[285:48.02]Here I go.
[285:56.92]OK, is that it?
[285:59.25]I don't think so.
[286:03.93]Out of the way.
[286:22.29]Try to get a suplex.
[286:31.21]Got it.
[286:32.91]Finally.
[286:37.11]Get out of the way.
[286:46.37]Ah, it's up on its...
[287:00.37]Over here.
[287:00.87]And then up.
[287:02.25]What did that do?
[287:44.76]He can't aim.
[287:45.78]Yes, I can.
[287:50.06]Nice.
[287:50.72]Always worth it, for sure.
[287:51.84]Absolutely worth it.
[288:13.11]Nice.
[288:14.55]I hear.
[288:14.75]Where is it?
[288:15.17]I don't think I'm going to get them all, but.
[288:39.63]Jerem of Bussin.
[288:45.92]Alright.
[288:47.16]Now, let's make this.
[288:49.54]I think I'm just going to take it.
[288:52.58]I'm almost at max health.
[288:56.50]Stop saying that.
[288:57.30]Alright.
[288:59.70]I'm sorry.
[289:03.58]I'm sorry.
[289:08.22]I can probably take one more hit, so maybe not.
[289:12.01]Alright, now here's a good question.
[289:12.83]How do I get the hell out of here?
[289:13.97]And where do I need... Where do I want to go from here?
[289:15.75]This way, right?
[289:32.18]Straight through here, right?
[289:39.73]Maybe?
[289:39.85]Maybe?
[289:58.33]I haven't been this way.
[289:58.93]Alright, another treasure.
[290:06.77]Did I just... Oh, there's a gunpowder.
[290:14.30]Nice.
[290:33.63]Windy out?
[290:34.09]What's going on here?
[290:35.89]Is it windy?
[290:36.61]This person has a hundred million HP.
[291:07.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[291:08.48]I can't get that ammo back.
[291:09.54]Why not?
[291:10.56]Is that for real?
[291:19.46]No, I can hit... There's a thing, right?
[291:21.16]I can shoot?
[291:22.64]Usually there is.
[291:27.18]Why would you... Why would... I can't get back up here now.
[291:30.14]What are you doing?
[291:43.54]Where the hell is this thing?
[291:53.00]See ya!
[291:53.94]It's a long way to go.
[292:19.81]Ooh, it's in there.
[292:20.73]Okay, I know what to do.
[292:27.43]They fall like The Sims.
[293:00.63]That is all the treasure here.
[293:01.95]I should be able to get across, right?
[293:19.36]This gets me all the way across.
[293:22.52]And then back to here.
[293:24.34]So where am I going now?
[293:25.82]Where's the mausoleum?
[293:33.56]Should I go across here and just up?
[293:35.70]I can't make it across this, right?
[293:38.50]It's the place where you were with Ashley.
[293:45.74]Get the bolts.
[293:46.50]Can I?
[293:46.82]I don't think I can go up.
[293:54.55]Could I have gone up?
[293:55.15]I just didn't see it.
[293:56.35]Okay, I can.
[294:01.37]Thank you.
[294:23.27]What?
[294:31.89]I think they actually are gone.
[294:32.79]Shit.
[294:44.47]I don't see one of those balls to drop either.

[296:20.61]Alright, hold on.
[296:26.60]It was right here.
[296:27.54]It was the grand hall.
[296:29.02]So grand hall.
[296:29.90]To...
[296:35.56]Can I get in this door now?
[296:41.24]Some rare things for sale.
[296:42.87]That's the fastest way to get back there.

[298:21.28]Hell yeah.
[298:21.62]Molding a weapon to suit your specific needs.
[298:24.70]It's a thing of beauty, isn't it?
[298:49.51]You are as you wished.
[298:54.66]This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.
[298:58.60]Little bit goes a long way.
[299:01.36]You will see.
[299:11.60]Heavy grenade?
[299:13.12]Never had that.
[299:14.40]Well, that's our choice to make.
[299:19.72]I'm just going to get rid of the laser sight.
[299:24.85]Yeah, what's the point of having this?
[299:25.75]I'm not going to use it for anything.
[299:27.85]I'm not using any of these weapons.
[299:31.69]Let's max this thing out.
[299:33.05]Alright, 100,000 to make this thing disgusting.
[299:35.13]For...
[299:47.92]You can get the ticket.
[299:49.00]I can get the ticket.
[299:50.36]I think that's the play.
[299:51.52]I'll get that after beating the knight.
[299:52.52]I need to make some herbs here.
[300:20.34]Wait, I already... Wait, what's going on?
[300:28.74]What is... It looks like I had a yellow.
[300:31.16]I don't.
[300:39.45]Give me the proc.
[300:46.32]There's 30 shots in this.
[300:48.10]Oh my god.
[300:52.05]30.
[300:52.47]We're getting there.
[301:02.52]What about the broken butterfly?
[301:04.38]Do the ticket on the broken butterfly?
[301:05.60]I don't know if I'm going to have enough money to upgrade the broken butterfly.
[301:11.60]Maybe much later in the game.
[301:14.09]Alright, so we need to go this way.
[301:16.19]I need to go right.
[301:18.13]Right.
[301:18.39]Right.
[301:19.79]Right.
[301:22.59]Right?
[301:23.29]Right?
[301:23.97]Right?
[301:25.17]Right?
[301:28.81]Right?
[301:39.63]Right?
[301:43.83]Right?
[301:58.35]Let's go.
[302:11.18]Good luck.
[302:23.99]These side quests are really, really fun.
[302:27.70]It makes backtracking way more interesting.
[302:30.20]Okay, hope all is well.
[302:45.30]Okay.
[302:46.44]Right back.
[302:47.20]Right back at you.
[302:53.68]That's the knight.
[302:55.25]The golden knight.
[303:02.96]I'm loading a fucking bomb on this thing.
[303:19.81]Whoa!
[303:21.23]Yeah!
[303:21.51]Another one!
[303:56.53]Ow!
[303:57.07]Shit!
[303:58.47]That hurt.
[304:13.61]Pop it!
[304:14.27]What?
[304:14.59]What's going on?
[304:17.52]Blow up!
[304:17.94]Why is it not blowing up?
[304:19.80]What's going on?
[304:22.92]It's on the ground.
[304:35.90]Wow.
[304:41.46]Jeez.
[304:51.71]What do you get?
[305:01.67]You get all three colors.
[305:06.75]Stop yelling.
[305:07.31]You're going to wake my parents up.
[305:13.79]Very cool.
[305:14.45]Alright.
[305:15.77]That was really cool.
[305:16.37]That was fun.
[305:16.81]I like these little mini bosses.
[305:18.22]That's so... What a cool addition.
[305:23.66]Found a use for those.
[305:29.66]The mines I think carried... This thing is so good.
[305:32.08]I talked way too much shit about this.
[305:37.20]This new weapon, the crossbow thing, is really good.
[305:43.41]It's really good.
[305:45.23]I talked a lot of shit about it.
[305:50.31]Nearly infinite ammo.
[305:54.63]And has bombs on it.
[305:56.47]Did I lose the arrows?
[305:57.89]Did I shoot them into the ceiling or something?
[306:01.49]I think I did.
[306:16.69]rock finally there we go that's so I can't wait to shoot this like 30 40 times in a row
[306:46.62]Now the throne room and that's it.
[306:49.03]We've done pretty much all the side things in the castle.
[306:53.24]And then we're in the end game, Peter.
[307:15.23]So I just need to go out through here.
[307:18.30]So straight, right, straight, straight.
[307:24.31]Straight, right, straight, straight.
[307:49.63]again.
[307:51.19]Did I unlock this door?
[307:52.21]I hope I did.
[307:54.36]Yeah, I did.
[307:57.02]And then it's straight again.
[308:04.18]What?
[308:07.52]Oh, right, right, right.
[308:08.28]It's fine.
[308:17.69]Got everything here, right?
[308:19.05]Yes.
[308:21.96]Throwing room time.
[308:33.34]Did I... I left this place in a pretty sorry state, huh?
[308:56.19]Jesus stop stop running.
[309:03.73]Oh My goodness First I'm gonna have a head What the fuck man
[309:39.69]I didn't have a head and he was still running at me.
[309:42.19]It's kind of a mess.
[310:04.03]OK.
[310:06.55]What is something scary in here?
[310:20.12]Ooh.
[310:20.26]October, eight years since my awakening.
[310:24.16]Alas, my noble pursuit progresses to its final stage, the fusion of human and insect.
[310:29.47]The housekeeper has graciously volunteered herself for the experiment.
[310:32.65]I shall pour my whole heart into this endeavor in order to transcend humanity and make Master Ramon proud.
[310:40.56]March, nine years since my awakening.
[310:43.69]A glorious union has been made.
[310:45.23]The housekeeper has endured much suffering, but not for naught.
[310:48.99]Behold, the fruits of our labor and all of its beauty.
[310:51.99]I shall consecrate this perfect life form with the name you three, where three is the most beautiful and complete number.
[310:58.58]I think 10 is, I think 10 is like a complete number.
[311:10.62]April, nine years since my awakening.
[311:12.04]You three, my dear hound, Pezenta, has been chosen to serve as the right hand of Master Ramon.
[311:18.99]But is two not better than one?
[311:21.63]Now it is my turn to demonstrate my loyalty.
[311:24.15]His humble servant, Isidro Urarite Talavera.
[311:31.49]The best things come in threes.
[311:32.75]I did like 100, though.
[311:38.94]Denominations of 100.
[311:39.58]100, I think, is a complete number.
[311:41.63]10.
[311:41.65]10, 100, 1,000.
[311:41.71]10,000, 1,000,000.
[311:41.97]10,000,000, 100,000,000.
[311:42.01]There are treasures here.
[312:06.65]Why are there chickens everywhere?
[312:07.95]How do I make them lay eggs?
[312:10.94]Why are there chickens in here?
[312:16.51]Why are they in here?
[312:24.44]Oh, Master Ramon.
[312:25.96]With tomorrow's procedure, I shall finally surpass the limitations of this mortal shell.
[312:30.14]What's left of me now shall be gone soon.
[312:33.20]Magnificent, the holy body is a wondrous miracle.
[312:35.79]The fealty I've sworn to Master Ramon is the sole light that illuminates my path.
[312:40.99]Our fates shall be entwined until the very end.
[312:43.67]Have you ever known such loyalty?
[312:45.01]Ooh, nice.
[313:00.71]That's a golden egg.
[313:04.06]I'll be taking this.
[313:05.56]I'll be taking that one.
[313:14.38]Nice.
[313:27.35]Cool.
[313:30.54]Now the painting.
[313:31.36]I feel like my hair looks like that sometimes.
[313:36.79]Where's the painting?
[313:41.25]Are you laying eggs?
[313:52.45]Where's the paint?
[313:53.93]What am I looking for?
[314:04.28]Got that one.
[314:04.90]Got that one.
[314:10.94]To face Ramon's portrait.
[314:15.70]Oh, it's just... Okay, I thought it was... So just destroy it.
[314:18.10]Okay, I can do that.
[314:19.06]That didn't work.
[314:34.19]I need an egg.
[314:34.77]Throw an egg at it.
[314:42.28]That's a golden egg.
[314:46.18]I don't want to throw the golden egg.
[314:50.32]Give me an egg.
[314:55.53]Egg?
[315:00.19]Just wait for the chickens.
[315:01.15]Don't chase them.
[315:36.64]There actually is.
[315:37.32]I'm dressed in the right outfit too.
[315:45.87]Elden Lord.
[316:01.40]I need an egg.
[316:12.38]Is this the right guy?
[316:28.26]Lay an egg already.
[316:29.48]I have an egg.
[316:31.12]I don't want to throw a golden egg.
[316:32.60]This thing is worth a lot of money.
[316:34.54]It's worth like 10 grand.
[316:37.60]Lay an egg yourself.
[317:00.52]Alright, I'm just going to sit right here.
[317:01.70]I'm not going to bother them.
[317:02.87]I'm going to let them do their thing.
[317:15.77]Shoot one?
[317:17.32]No, I don't want to shoot one.
[317:35.07]shoot the air scare them they'll drop one this chicken does not give a shit they don't care
[318:04.77]Pet the chicken.
[318:15.00]You can't.
[318:19.58]I feel like an egg is supposed to drop here, but the game does not want to give me one.
[318:26.46]Very clearly, this chicken's in this room because we're supposed to shoot it.
[318:32.62]I don't, what if I shoot it?
[318:34.32]Shoot it?
[318:37.88]I gave you one.
[318:38.70]No, I had to get the puzzle box to get one.
[318:41.08]Oh!
[319:03.36]you can actually even that's funny you can do that you can throw eggs at people just wait until a few weeks go by and somebody does a egg percent where they just farm eggs fill their inventory put on all the egg charms and kill the last boss with eggs this is gonna happen
[319:29.90]Alright, thank you for the eggs.
[319:30.90]I appreciate it.
[319:32.62]Have a nice... Got another one.
[319:37.25]I got a better idea.
[319:37.79]I'm just gonna fucking... I have a charm that heals me 100%.
[320:02.13]Two is enough.
[320:03.33]Two is enough.
[320:03.89]You've done a good job.
[320:07.51]Two is enough.
[320:09.21]Three would be great.
[320:10.21]Two is enough.
[320:11.39]Three would be great.
[320:13.83]Two is enough, though.
[320:15.87]Two is enough.
[320:17.21]Three would be fantastic.
[320:19.17]Two is enough.
[320:22.85]There you go.
[320:25.38]Alright.
[320:26.82]I wish you very long chicken lives.
[320:32.83]Good day.
[320:42.82]Very nice.
[320:45.52]So, turn in.
[320:47.04]And then we're going to make our way that way.
[320:56.17]Back to where we were.
[321:08.87]I got work at 6 a.m.
[321:10.05]Speed it up.
[321:12.41]I can assure you that I am at least at least 6 to 10 hours away from completing this game.
[321:23.08]At minimum.
[321:31.45]Are you seriously going to do that right now?
[321:36.89]You're not going to actually make me take this.
[321:38.59]A bunch of shit.
[321:44.39]I can't believe I actually had to do that.
[321:45.75]Alright.
[322:08.46]Let me just go turn these in.
[322:10.66]I'm going to upgrade this.
[322:12.66]No, I'm not.
[322:13.04]I'm going to get the ticket at least.
[322:19.74]Eight spinals.
[322:21.34]Four spinals.
[322:22.34]Alright, I'm going to buy one of these.
[322:26.19]So now I have it.
[322:27.01]And then... Ooh, wait a minute here.
[322:35.99]Oh yeah.
[322:47.32]The ticket is pointless.
[322:49.28]The ticket is not pointless because I don't want to spend $100,000 on this.
[323:02.23]Essentially, the ticket is worth $100,000.
[323:05.37]So, if I plan on upgrading this at all anymore, or the Magnum, that's $100,000 that I can actually upgrade a third weapon with.
[323:18.95]So, it's worth it, especially for the expensive stuff.
[323:22.79]You're essentially trading this for $100,000.
[323:23.79]Okay.
[323:33.69]Very nice.
[323:38.57]Let's continue.
[323:41.45]Next place I'm going is just progress, which is this way, right?
[323:51.81]Yeah.
[323:54.41]Yes.
[323:55.33]Because I had to ride the trolley.
[323:57.25]Okay.
[323:58.93]Bang a right.
[323:59.45]Bang a right.
[324:01.87]Straight.
[324:14.33]Upgrade.
[324:14.73]What?
[324:16.01]You didn't use it.
[324:16.67]Use the ticket.
[324:17.37]What?
[324:21.04]No, no, no.
[324:21.90]I don't want to.
[324:22.70]Not yet.
[324:24.86]Not yet.
[324:25.16]Oh, I walked in a circle.
[324:30.76]Not yet, because I want to know if I upgrade the other stuff, I want to make sure I have a ticket.
[324:36.85]It's called hoarding.
[324:40.31]I haven't made a decision.
[324:41.61]What if I want to use the ticket on the revolver?
[324:44.21]What if I want to use the ticket on the bolt gun?
[324:48.05]You know what I mean?
[324:49.00]It's called hoarding and it's called having remorse for selling or whatever it is.
[324:55.06]That makes no sense.
[324:55.84]Yes, it does.
[324:56.24]What do you mean?
[324:59.54]Then it wouldn't be worth 100k.
[325:09.38]The tickets do not require it to be fully upgraded.
[325:11.90]What do you mean?
[325:19.75]No, you have to... You fully upgrade everything.
[325:23.57]Spend 60k on the bolt gun and you... I don't have 60k.
[325:25.85]I'm just going to hold it.
[325:28.41]I'm going to hold.
[325:29.59]I'm holding it.
[325:31.73]You can use the ticket on any weapon without upgrading it.
[325:33.79]What?
[325:36.73]What?
[325:38.23]I thought it was either spend money or the ticket.
[325:41.63]Hold on.
[325:42.13]I'm confused now.
[325:43.55]Now I got hit.
[325:44.31]Just let me get back up here so I'm not as confused.
[326:05.81]Give me a second.
[326:12.04]Where the hell am I going?
[326:18.11]Is it down and then... Wait, where am I going here?
[326:20.41]What the fuck's happening?
[326:33.25]Why is that closed?
[326:35.07]Where am I going?
[326:42.49]Bro, where am I going right now?
[326:44.43]Where am I going right now?
[326:46.99]I'm like running back to the... This room sucks.
[326:55.48]They just never-endingly spawn.
[327:01.84]Bro, where am I going?
[327:16.26]Alright, let me look at this one more time.
[327:17.60]So... Okay, so let's... So I don't have... So I... This will upgrade the whole thing.
[327:25.59]So this will max the whole weapon out, is what you're saying.
[327:48.16]No, it only gives the exclusive.
[327:51.40]So then what's the problem then?
[328:02.59]There is no problem.
[328:04.31]You don't need to max it out to get the exclusive.
[328:09.57]Oh, okay, okay.
[328:10.91]I see, I see, I see.
[328:11.99]Sorry, there's like music in my ears.
[328:15.15]So, it just, you don't have to upgrade it all the way.
[328:18.45]I get it.
[328:18.91]But I don't, do I want to use this on the revolver?
[328:23.30]There's three weapons that I want to get to max.
[328:25.64]And I don't know what two of them there are.
[328:28.96]There's this one, there's this one, and then there's a revolver.
[328:33.70]I don't know, because I've got to figure out which one I want to do that to.
[328:39.81]Do I want to do it to the bolt gun and the revolver?
[328:42.99]Or the handgun and the revolver?
[328:45.25]Or the handgun and the bolt gun?
[328:51.00]This is the most logical decision.
[328:54.06]So I guess we'll do this one.
[329:00.04]This thing is now amazing.
[329:05.24]So now I'm going to focus all of my money...
[329:10.23]Into the revolver, I think.
[329:12.41]Well, the Magnum.
[329:13.23]I should be able to do it to three of them.
[329:15.87]Why is the third...
[329:38.67]Save point gone.
[329:40.53]That's freaking me out.
[329:41.13]Alright.
[329:44.35]I am ready to go, and I want to make sure I get this the right way.
[329:47.03]So, it's... How did I fuck this up?
[329:49.73]It's out here, to the right, to the... Okay.
[329:54.67]Is it from the ballroom?
[330:00.90]The autosave was the... Oh, okay.
[330:03.96]It's north of the bug room.
[330:07.18]I feel like I was going that way.
[330:11.98]You were actually going the right direction.
[330:13.52]Oh shit, I just freaked out.
[330:17.85]So it's in the bug room, left.
[330:28.28]Just don't go up the stairs.
[330:40.17]Alright.
[330:40.69]You know, I thought this was blocked off.
[330:42.35]That's my problem.
[330:46.80]I thought it was blocked off.
[330:55.66]Alright.
[330:56.18]Time to actually get game progress.
[330:57.64]Probably not going to stream for that much longer.
[331:02.52]Maybe to the end of this chapter, I would say.
[331:05.70]Maybe the boss.
[331:06.36]I think we're getting close to the boss.
[331:19.11]Right up here.
[331:21.82]Alright Ashley, I'm finally here.
[331:24.06]Sorry I had to communicate with a bunch of people on upgrades.
[331:39.07]You are nothing if not unyielding, Mr. Kennedy.
[331:44.35]However, I'm afraid it ends here.
[331:47.66]Expel this intruder!
[331:53.08]You wish.
[331:55.44]To the top of the tower.
[332:13.28]Always make sure to know when to run.
[332:22.57]I wanted to suplex the guy because everybody was yelling at me to do it.
[333:03.26]I'm almost out of ammo.
[333:20.19]God, I like this gun.
[333:22.03]I picked wrong.
[333:22.73]I have seller's remorse.
[333:25.03]Buyer's remorse.
[333:26.85]I should have upgraded this all the way.
[333:33.19]I'm just gonna restart the whole game.
[334:24.01]Spray.
[334:50.18]Probably a treasure from that.
[334:52.36]There's a treasure from that, right?
[334:55.42]Right?
[335:16.41]I don't want to miss everything.
[335:20.70]Nice.
[335:22.54]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[335:23.74]There's a lot of stuff in here, right?
[335:55.15]It's 10k right there.
[335:56.61]Simple, easy.
[336:06.30]I guess that big statue does not drop anything.
[336:22.58]I know I'm being map Andy right now, but I just want to... You gotta check it every so often.
[336:27.40]No?
[336:34.00]My god!
[337:10.54]Where's the ball?
[337:12.48]That's a slow ball.
[337:16.83]You're gonna make it, aren't you?
[337:19.73]You gotta be kidding me.
[337:20.67]You actually made that?
[337:22.33]That's impressive, but fuck you.
[337:45.32]Am I safe here?
[337:47.28]Yeah.
[337:48.30]Damn it.
[338:14.58]Alright, there is a treasure somewhere here.
[338:17.34]Okay.
[339:20.91]Looney Tunes.
[339:25.77]This weapon is so much better now.
[339:27.07]I'm glad I listened to you guys.
[339:30.65]I like the bolt gun, but, you know, it's okay.
[339:32.24]It's all good.
[339:38.80]Hmm.
[339:52.07]Here's one.
[339:57.23]Mirror with pearls and rubies.
[339:59.05]Nice.
[340:01.41]The other treasure is over there or over there.
[340:05.17]I think I can just go.
[340:21.53]Nice.
[340:23.77]Hey, I gotta go to bed.
[340:24.63]Hope you're enjoying Resident Evil 4 Remastered.
[340:26.75]It is fantastic.
[340:31.30]There's one more.
[340:33.14]Oh well.
[340:38.86]Did he drop his staff?
[341:11.21]Oh!
[342:30.38]Don't push me off, please!
[342:45.55]Shit!
[342:46.73]Need to drop some weight.
[343:12.31]Let's go!
[343:12.77]Don't miss that.
[343:36.33]Just a silver token?
[343:37.79]That sucks.
[344:14.61]So out of place it really is I completely forgot that she was in that oven Almost there
[345:09.07]Fuck.
[345:13.19]Damn, a rifle would be pretty good here.
[345:14.66]Ban that person for five minutes.
[345:16.84]No, ban that person for six minutes.
[345:20.71]We're going over.
[345:21.39]We're going overboard.
[345:22.35]We're going over.
[345:43.64]We're going overboard.
[345:51.96]Nice shot.
[346:11.36]She's getting kicked out of the My Chemical Romance concert.
[346:24.15]alright I got another I think I'm at max uh health this should do it right that little bit that's left that should give me 100 max HP so then we don't really care about yellow herbs anymore which is interesting that's good welcome well then what can I do you for
[346:51.67]Ruby's all rubbish.
[346:52.65]She makes no difference.
[346:54.49]Thank you.
[347:06.60]Do I complete the clock?
[347:19.20]Red is the shittiest, right?
[347:45.19]Not quite.
[347:46.27]We need a red or... I could take the green out of this.
[347:52.99]That'd be a four color.
[347:54.03]Yep.
[347:57.72]Yeah, that's good.
[348:00.20]I still apparently have... I didn't use all these keys.
[348:09.78]Stranger.
[348:12.23]I'll pay a pretty penny for that.
[348:15.77]Okay, now the question becomes, I have 100,000 gold.
[348:19.57]I'm going to pull out the revolver.
[348:30.69]What can we do here?
[348:32.67]Welcome.
[348:38.81]A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.
[348:52.82]I've made my decision.
[348:54.08]I've made my choice.
[348:54.80]I'm gonna max this out.
[348:58.06]And I'm gonna be so fucked up in the end.
[349:00.94]I'm gonna be so fucked up.
[349:23.70]I'm going to have like 25 magnum shots and 50 shotgun shots that are all going to come out in 10 seconds.
[349:29.61]I could go up.
[349:39.55]What is going up to?
[349:42.11]What is up?
[349:43.32]What's up, dog?
[349:50.52]First aid spray.
[349:57.41]What the fuck?
[349:58.41]Oh my god.
[349:59.47]So, you got me.
[350:01.23]Who got me?
[350:01.90]Okay.
[350:05.68]Actually, let me save it because I'll forget to do that again.
[350:14.06]How's my eye twitching?
[350:16.50]Annoying.
[350:21.91]Give it... I have 15 saves.
[350:24.05]I'm such a... I save every two seconds.
[350:27.94]No way I'd be able to ever do that.
[350:32.56]This is dark Jerma today.
[350:33.94]No, it's not.
[350:36.54]I think this is pretty neutral.
[350:38.06]No, I think this is definitely not dark Jerma.
[350:42.98]Oh, you've seen dark Jerma before.
[351:00.76]Here we go.
[351:01.28]50 shots in this thing, and they all come out in 5 seconds.
[351:07.19]I got it.
[351:08.17]48 shotgun bullets loaded.
[351:10.09]And just because I want to know, I want to know.
[351:14.29]I want to see.
[351:18.76]I want to time how long it takes to unload the whole thing.
[351:22.16]I want to test it.
[351:22.80]Okay.
[351:28.80]Let's test it.
[351:40.47]This thing is fucking crazy Gun rhymes with fun for a reason sir
[352:07.96]Oh shit, I'm out.
[352:19.62]So I have to just open the, you know, when like the eye opens or whatever, just go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[352:24.43]Do that like three times and I win.
[352:26.69]Okay, let's go.
[352:38.59]I want to... Wait, let me load this because I upgraded it, didn't I?
[352:51.10]You know what kind of stinks?
[352:52.50]It's not a big deal.
[352:54.22]I can't mouse scroll to the other weapon.
[352:57.21]I have to press 5.
[352:57.99]Look at this thing.
[353:08.43]20 shots in this thing it's middle click oh it is okay thank you took me to the last third of the game to figure that out and so
[353:34.45]I have delivered the girl to you as promised.
[353:40.20]Do tell our lord to not forget the loyalty of his servant, Ramon.
[353:53.92]Ashley!
[353:55.12]Leon!
[353:59.87]Such a fool, Mr. Gennady.
[354:03.23]Uh oh, not the bubbling boss sound.
[354:06.47]Not the bubbling sludge boss sound effect.
[354:34.60]Being granted by my master, the power of the god!
[354:40.34]Stage is set for the final act!
[354:51.07]You are no match for my script, Mr. Kennedy.
[354:56.55]So don't get too carried away.
[354:58.56]Your biggest sin is over.
[355:08.95]Let's go!
[355:11.97]That is not fair RNG.
[355:13.65]Look at that.
[355:28.61]Just give me the go-ahead and I'm gonna fucking unload on him.
[355:34.35]Give me the go-ahead!
[355:52.53]Give me the- give me the green light!
[355:53.57]Give me the green light!
[356:01.04]GAAAAAAAH!
[356:08.85]What are you gonna do, motherfucker?!
[356:11.55]What are you gonna do about it?!
[356:17.15]Hm?! !
[356:20.44]Fucking go!
[356:21.76]Let's go!
[356:25.00]Let's go!
[356:25.56]Cue the cutscene!
[356:27.64]He didn't even get a chance to say half his lines.
[356:42.31]And I still got half my bullets.
[356:48.00]We're good.
[356:53.06]So fucking stupid.
[357:00.02]I made him come out of his shell like five times.
[357:07.20]You just got clown makeup?
[357:12.37]That was fucking fun.
[357:13.81]I told you it was worth it.
[357:18.17]Alright.
[357:19.35]That was fun.
[357:22.32]I got everything in the room, right?
[357:23.34]Let me just check.
[357:26.32]No, I did not.
[357:26.82]Just go around and look at this.
[357:27.90]All these things that wanted me to use.
[357:30.64]What's in here?
[357:32.20]Handgun ammo.
[357:33.42]Oh, I ran out of ammo.
[357:34.72]Craft.
[357:35.70]What's this?
[357:36.00]Oh, a bunch of gunpowder.
[357:38.47]Make some more arrows.
[357:40.69]Oh, I have to dodge that.
[357:41.73]Shit.
[357:42.25]Oh, I got hit.
[357:55.09]Nice ego.
[357:59.99]That was so funny.
[358:01.53]I loved every second of that.
[358:02.69]I think I cleared out everything.
[358:08.44]Yep.
[358:12.90]It probably would have been cheaper to buy an RPG and just shoot him once.
[358:19.00]Where's the fun in that, though?
[358:21.96]That is kind of fun, but, you know...
[358:25.00]No time to lose.
[358:34.21]Come on.
[358:34.73]Let's start replenishing it.
[358:46.68]Already almost there.
[358:56.61]Alright, next save point, I'm gonna call it.
[358:58.07]And then I'll give you the schedule for this coming week.
[359:08.68]Still four chapters left.
[359:12.59]Five chapters left.
[359:24.67]16, wait, where are we?
[359:25.55]Number 11 or 12?
[359:27.05]We still, yeah, this Krauser.
[359:29.43]There's at least two or three other encounters left.
[359:39.28]First playthrough?
[359:39.82]Nope.
[359:40.34]This would be, well, of the remake, yeah.
[359:44.48]But this is probably the third or fourth time I've played through Resident Evil 4.
[359:51.89]There is no...
[359:55.29]Yeah, we still have the scary chapter or two.
[359:58.51]There's at least two or three hours left still, at least.
[360:02.94]Might even be like four.
[360:04.96]So this will be another stream for sure.
[360:07.32]Yeah, the lab.
[360:08.00]Yeah, this is at least four plus hours.
[360:12.71]Where's this?
[360:13.15]Oh, it's in here.
[360:33.38]Hanging?
[360:33.66]Did I miss it?
[360:34.16]Yeah.
[360:38.98]Still top 20?
[360:41.14]Yeah, I would say... I mean, the Resident Evil 4 video game is definitely top 20, top 25 games of all time.
[360:51.25]I failed you, my lord.
[360:52.39]I was unable to fulfill your final commandment and keep the boy from the path of wickedness.
[360:59.36]got a glimpse of Master Ramon's evil temperament during his younger years.
[361:03.79]When he discovered a servant mocked him by uttering, Pulgarcito behind his back, he summoned her to his private chambers.
[361:11.91]After forcing her to kneel before him, Ramon doused her face with a vial of vitriol he pulled out of his pocket.
[361:21.21]The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed in agony as the skin melted from her face.
[361:26.93]His twisted grin still haunts my dreams to this day.
[361:30.03]As time passed, Ramon's treachery only deepened, and that infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his vulnerable heart.
[361:36.46]Curse the fiends!
[361:39.45]Shit.
[362:15.53]perfect won't have to swim after all cool yeah next safe point I'm gonna call it what's the worst feeling texture ah damn it chalkboard looking for something
[362:51.38]Yeah, there it is.

[363:14.73]And that is it.
[363:17.27]Thanks for watching.
[363:19.09]We are at chapter 13.
[363:20.25]There are three chapters left.
[363:23.67]Each of these will probably be about an hour and a half or so, hour.
[363:27.15]Sounds like it's about three or four hours plus.
[363:29.38]It's probably one more stream.
[363:30.66]Maybe do some more side content.
[363:33.04]Also unlocking the other stuff after beating the game, which should be fun to play for like an hour or two.
[363:39.72]So here's the deal.
[363:41.40]The next time you'll see me live will probably be 1 a.m.
[363:45.69]Holy shit.
[363:48.78]Let's see.
[363:53.57]Probably Wednesday.
[363:54.33]Maybe we'll do Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.
[363:59.21]We'll finish Resident Evil 4 on Wednesday.
[364:03.96]And then... We will go to Breath of the Wild on Thursday or Friday.

[366:07.61]This man just scammed an innocent viewer.

[366:15.76]And I said that I would be playing it again.
[366:17.90]Hey, watch out.
[366:20.40]You gotta make sure you ask the right question.
[366:24.42]He didn't say.

[366:27.62]He said, continue playing.
[366:31.69]I would choose your words more carefully next time.
