[00:05.20]Hello.
[00:06.96]Hi.
[00:08.28]Yes.
[00:08.64]I'm currently... I'm currently late.
[00:11.76]But it's okay.
[00:12.68]It's a very good reason to be late.
[00:14.02]And I'll show you the reason.
[00:15.00]Well, he's running out.
[00:16.08]He ran out of the room.
[00:16.84]Never mind.
[00:18.23]He ran out.
[00:20.81]He was here.
[00:21.37]Arto.
[00:24.67]Hold on.
[00:25.25]Ready?
[00:27.41]Arto, look.
[00:28.41]Arto, come over here.
[00:30.09]Go.
[00:30.39]Go over there.
[00:31.82]Quick, I need to show you on stream.
[00:36.19]Ato, what's this?
[00:37.27]Ato, what's over there?
[00:38.01]Ato!
[00:40.89]Hey, Ato!
[00:42.21]Ato!
[00:43.41]Ato!
[00:44.75]You saw his tail.
[00:45.76]Alright, whatever.
[00:46.72]I was trying to get him to be on camera.
[00:51.68]And it's like bed.
[00:53.68]It don't matter.
[00:54.16]Alright, go back to the intro.
[00:55.04]You saw his tail.
[00:55.96]See?
[00:56.34]There he is.
[00:59.94]Maybe he'll show back up.
[01:00.78]Ato!
[01:01.36]Ato!
[01:06.65]What's that, a biscuit?
[01:09.71]A biscuit!
[01:10.15]Alright, I'll get out of the way, alright.
[01:17.69]Alright, alright, alright.
[01:19.49]Back to the intro.
[01:21.85]Is Otto a tortoise?
[01:23.60]Um, he's kind of as fat as a tortoise.
[01:38.56]Just in time to see Otto.
[01:40.65]Yeah, he chased a little milk boat in here.
[01:46.95]Otto is a wise beast.
[01:48.43]Alright, yeah.
[01:52.69]We're going to play more Elden Ring.
[01:54.06]Hello?
[01:54.98]Let me just tweet this.
[01:56.84]I just did want to show that because people were asking, where is Otto?
[02:01.88]Oh, there's Otto.
[02:05.62]Now let's let the intro play out for a minute.
[02:07.19]Hold on.
[03:10.75]Okay, I'm back.
[03:16.15]Okay, so you're also probably noticing something very important.
[03:18.89]This is very, very important.
[03:20.29]There's no drop frames, and there shouldn't be.
[03:28.19]I have absolutely no idea why that's been happening, but I think I've fixed it.
[03:38.93]I did a bunch of stream tests on a bunch of different servers.
[03:44.85]And I found a server.
[03:46.41]I found one of the Twitch servers.
[03:47.81]A server that is working well.
[03:51.69]I've streamed to the same server for like two years.
[03:55.24]And I can't stream to it anymore, I guess.
[03:58.64]I don't know why.
[03:59.18]I have no idea.
[04:07.65]Nothing changed on my end, it's just... I don't know if the traffic has started getting routed in a different way.
[04:13.76]But... I guess cross your fingers, because I think this is going to be fine.
[04:22.24]Please stop playing Elden Ring.
[04:23.82]Is this your retirement special?
[04:25.58]What, like I'm just going hard and then I'm never coming back?
[04:29.44]I lo- Okay.
[04:30.70]Okay, listen.
[04:32.62]Games like these only come around like once every half a decade.
[04:37.75]So, no, look, I'm not gonna go play, like, fucking bathtub simulator right now.
[04:43.60]Elden Ring comes along once every fucking half decade, right?
[04:46.96]Maybe once every decade.
[04:51.56]We'll, I promise, we'll go back to, like, we'll go back to fucking screwdriver simulator in, like, a week, alright?
[04:57.79]Alright?
[05:03.39]Where you play as a screwdriver and you have to roll around and get to checkpoints only using your body to roll.
[05:09.66]We'll go back to those.
[05:10.78]Just give me some time.
[05:18.52]Art simulator.
[05:21.76]Actually, it's funny because we actually might play Mario Golf in a couple days or something.
[05:28.43]That's a pretty good way to break up Elden Ring, right?
[05:32.59]That one person that said you should play Mario Golf, and I was like, no, that sounds like a dumb idea.
[05:37.93]Well, I'm just going to play Mario Golf.
[05:42.63]So, maybe the next stream after this will be Mario Golf, and then we'll go back to Elden Ring.
[05:48.42]But currently very into it.
[05:49.72]At least into it enough to keep streaming it.
[05:52.84]We'll see.
[05:53.42]I don't... This game is massive, so I don't know how far I'm going to get.
[05:57.08]All I know is right now I'm super interested, so let's go.
[05:59.42]You guys ready?
[06:01.96]Better be.
[06:04.52]Make sure I'm in a good spot.
[06:06.26]Make sure that the camera's in a good spot.
[06:10.55]And, I mean, are we good?
[06:12.65]We should be.
[06:13.07]Still just hanging out?
[06:17.77]He's still hanging out.
[06:18.83]I can't promise he'll be here the whole time.
[06:20.47]He'll probably start running around.
[06:23.51]He's an explorer.
[06:25.73]he auto does not have one particular place that he likes um I've had to get like three different little dog beds because he I want to be in this room no no I want to be in this room he'll go down into he'll go into another room and lie on a pile of clothes and it's like
[06:47.38]What are you doing in here?
[06:48.14]I could get you a bed.
[06:50.32]And then a bed, I'll get a little bed in that same spot where the clothes were.
[06:55.61]And he sits in that bed all the time.
[06:57.05]It's one of his, like, bonfires.
[07:00.13]Otto has literally bonfires all around every place I've ever been in.
[07:08.33]And some of them, I got him a really expensive bed and he doesn't like it.
[07:17.39]I wasn't calling Otto fat.
[07:20.17]No, well you can call Otto fat because he is a little fat.
[07:24.90]Alright, you guys ready?
[07:27.70]I'm very happy that the internet seems to be good.
[07:29.40]I seem to have found the server that works.
[07:32.52]So, let's hope that continues.
[07:36.75]You're probably wondering why I have 20,000 souls when I had like two last stream.
[07:41.51]That's very important.
[07:43.48]It's because I was testing the internet.
[07:45.67]So I was just running around doing like a stream test.
[07:49.23]And just trying to replicate the problem.
[07:52.05]And the problem has not been replicated.
[07:55.49]So, yeah, whatever.
[07:56.65]And I may have like... I may have like fucking... I may have read a few things.
[08:04.77]I may have like read a lot.
[08:07.97]What level am I right now?
[08:09.11]I am level 73.
[08:09.71]So...
[08:22.32]Let's do this first, because we do this every stream.
[08:24.44]Let's take a look at what we can do here.
[08:28.44]Some of this stuff needs to be updated.
[08:30.48]For instance, Light, Fires, and Nokron.
[08:33.60]We already did that.
[08:35.94]Rennes is closed for now.
[08:37.24]It is no longer closed.
[08:38.54]We got to it.
[08:41.47]This is still accurate.
[08:42.83]This is still accurate.
[08:44.81]This is still accurate.
[08:45.81]Can I get rid of this?
[08:51.16]Door next to spawn is blocked shut.
[08:54.78]Should I just remove that?
[08:57.70]I feel like that's completely irrelevant.
[09:02.40]Alright, whatever.
[09:04.78]So the last thing that I did, I was about to go down here.
[09:06.97]We're currently doing Renna's quest.
[09:10.87]Which is going to lead us apparently down here.
[09:15.05]No audio.
[09:16.19]Let me fix that immediately.
[09:20.78]Let's go.
[09:23.08]Oh, well, I already see a huge problem.
[09:24.64]Facecam is not even in the right spot.
[09:28.94]It's already a big problem.
[09:33.50]That's better.
[09:35.62]Is it better?
[09:37.52]It is.
[09:39.06]Kind of.
[09:41.50]Okay.
[09:42.40]Okay.
[09:42.92]Okay.
[09:44.75]Alright, let's go.
[09:48.72]If you're wondering the kind of character I'm playing, I'm playing a little bit of intelligence, a little bit of dexterity, a little bit of int.
[09:55.28]I think I'm probably about to run into something that I'm not prepared for right now.
[09:58.30]But, whatever.
[09:59.02]It's Elden Ring, baby.
[10:01.06]You just fucking gotta go.
[10:01.90]Are you doing a bimbo build?
[10:11.17]Um, I don't, I don't know.
[10:15.31]I actually was laughing my ass off.
[10:17.73]I was, I was, okay.
[10:19.13]So before I fell asleep last night, I was laughing.
[10:23.14]I couldn't stop laughing because I was thinking about the me strong.
[10:29.32]Like, no, you have to do one stream as me strong, but you have to be high on, on THC.
[10:36.01]and I just I don't know I started laughing so hard about it because like you imagine this this fucking this guy this caveman like a loincloth and a big turkey leg club just like ate a bunch of berries he found and he's just like fucking fucked up and high and he's the guy that can like he can like kill Margit no that guy would die instantly that guy would die without even anyone attacking him
[11:02.52]I'm just imagining this, like, just completely hallucinogenic, high caveman.
[11:08.00]Just walking around and killing stuff.
[11:09.64]And it's just like, why are you in this universe?
[11:11.66]You should not be in this universe.
[11:16.75]And, like, that's what would be happening.
[11:17.99]It would just be... I would be... inebriated, I guess, in quotes.
[11:23.85]And I would be just roleplaying as this weird caveman.
[11:27.79]That's how the ancestors did it.
[11:29.03]Yeah, that's like kind of fucking weird.
[11:31.11]That's exactly what happened.
[11:34.12]This bush.
[11:35.62]Colorful bush.
[11:40.34]Oh.
[11:42.28]You.
[11:43.78]I kill you.
[11:44.66]Like, no, no, no.
[11:45.28]Don't kill me.
[11:45.78]What are you talking about?
[11:46.62]Don't hurt me.
[11:48.42]It was fucking nonsense back then.
[11:57.52]That's... What got me on that is... You want to talk about bimbo gameplay?
[12:03.12]That's not how weed works.
[12:04.10]I'm not saying weed.
[12:04.84]I'm saying, like, back in, like, the fucking... Before the prehistoric medieval times.
[12:09.83]Where, like, cavemen were eating, like, random hallucinogenic berries and fucking killing each other.
[12:14.55]Of course that's not what happens if you have, like... What are you talking about?
[12:19.75]Alright.
[12:23.04]I actually think I can level up.
[12:23.88]Let's do it.
[12:27.79]Ooh, that's a clean 10k.
[12:31.19]That's a clean 10k.
[12:34.61]31, okay.
[12:44.49]Why is that a clip on command?
[12:47.87]I didn't see it.
[12:48.47]What was it?
[12:54.09]Alright, I think...
[12:58.25]I can't see.
[13:00.31]I can't see.
[13:01.09]He can't see.
[13:01.61]I can't see.
[13:02.35]Why am I doing so many mad, mad, mad, mad world references?
[13:04.81]Maybe it's because I watched it recently.
[13:06.84]I'm going to say... Should we just dump intelligence and try to get it to 50?
[13:12.82]Or do I need to seriously put more points in endurance?
[13:18.85]Endurance is not an issue in this game.
[13:21.01]It really isn't.
[13:25.34]Something that's changed in this game, I don't know what they did, or what kind of math or calculations they've been making in Elden Ring.
[13:31.50]I don't even feel like endurance is the bar.
[13:35.13]It feels like it's very, very forgiving, to a point where, like, you don't even need to put points into it.
[13:42.85]Unless you're doing, like, a heavy character, yeah.
[13:45.09]But it used to be, you would need to put endurance points in because the stamina bar was hard to manage.
[13:50.54]Alright, how do I get down here?
[13:58.12]Can I jump from here?
[13:58.94]I have to jump?
[14:08.43]Are you kidding me?
[14:09.21]I'm gonna die if I fall down here.
[14:14.72]No, I can't do that.
[14:16.12]So where do I go?
[14:16.74]There's a lip right here.
[14:22.32]Oh, shit.
[14:26.32]Okay.
[14:26.46]Okay.
[14:32.03]Golden Centipede.
[14:33.49]Sick.
[14:34.29]How do you like your eggs?
[14:35.09]I want to know.
[14:36.63]Over medium.
[14:40.46]I don't think eggs should be eaten over easy or sunny side up.
[14:43.50]Unless the yolk is not... I like a jammy yolk.
[14:46.73]I do not like a runny yolk.
[14:48.09]I find that to be... It gets everywhere.
[14:49.89]It gets all over everything.
[14:52.70]A jammy yolk is able, you get the benefits of having it be a little bit runny, but it doesn't get all over your whole plate.
[14:59.65]And you don't need, like, five napkins to go like this and shit.
[15:03.59]And sometimes, I don't know, whenever I have a runny egg, it gets all over me.
[15:06.38]I don't know why.
[15:13.95]I don't understand how, but it just does.
[15:17.53]Like, it'll get, like, here or something, and then it's, like, here, and then it's, like, on a napkin, and then it, like, starts solidifying.
[15:22.35]No.
[15:23.55]No runny yolk.
[15:25.11]It's all over everything.
[15:29.22]Hey, do you want eggs?
[15:30.04]This, this, and this?
[15:32.32]Oh, sorry.
[15:32.80]What you meant to say was put egg all over all the stuff that I have.
[15:36.46]I want egg yolk all over everything that I have on my plate.
[15:39.82]Now, separate it.
[15:40.72]I like having it with... I like a jammy yolk.
[15:44.29]Because it's still a little runny, but it doesn't get everywhere.
[15:50.62]I don't think that's such a weird take.
[15:52.56]You eat like a two-year-old.
[15:54.26]Enjoying jammy yolks is not a two-year-old thing.
[15:57.42]A two-year-old would be, Mommy, I'm like, I'm scrambled.
[16:00.12]So, no, I don't think your take is accurate.
[16:08.13]Oh, I hate these guys.
[16:14.77]Jeez, your attack patterns are fucking weird.
[16:21.70]718 damage.
[16:23.06]Why would I even normally swing?
[16:28.36]Why would I even swing the katana if I'm doing that much damage?
[16:34.15]Pests?
[16:34.79]Alright, hold on.
[16:35.41]I can't look at that yet.
[16:39.21]You're making a mess when you shouldn't.
[16:44.31]I mean, honest to God, this is the best.
[16:46.41]I don't know how this is scaling with my intelligence.
[16:49.11]That magic ability is unbelievably good.
[16:52.46]I'm actually concerned they're going to nerf it.
[16:55.14]It's that good.
[17:04.56]700 fucking damage.
[17:05.92]Versus, like, 200 or 300 damage a swing.
[17:08.80]300 damage a swing.
[17:11.16]And the range is unbelievable.
[17:12.60]That's getting nerfed.
[17:22.03]Sword of the Night and Fire is better.
[17:23.89]It's 2,000 damage.
[17:27.51]Really?
[17:27.81]Holy shit.
[17:28.58]Alright, well, let's go.
[17:41.75]He's such a weirdo.
[17:42.43]I don't like this guy.
[17:43.15]You know what I mean?
[17:47.18]Sometimes he'll go down, but he doesn't swing.
[17:50.42]Late game is stupid, so it makes sense.
[17:53.95]Okay, that's a good to know.
[17:55.81]So wait, that's like not crazy?
[17:57.27]I feel like it is though.
[18:04.69]Late game is nutty.
[18:06.80]Oh.
[18:08.12]Alright, well, I want these items, and I don't care if I die, because I'm item-run Andy.
[18:12.28]So, I don't... I know, like, some people you've probably seen play this game just look over here and go.
[18:16.30]Nah, I don't give a fuck.
[18:22.67]What?
[18:22.93]Hello?
[18:24.99]What is this thing?
[18:30.58]What?
[18:30.92]Oh my god!
[18:35.24]Get out of here!
[18:41.85]Okay, well, this is like a rot dragon.
[18:43.67]It really is just that guy that I... How much health does he have?
[18:53.13]Alright, well, I can't... I'm literally going to die from the rot.
[18:59.25]Oh, just come.
[19:01.60]Damn.
[19:01.98]Alright, well, that's a kind of weird mini-boss over there.
[19:10.56]But look at how wise this guy is.
[19:12.08]He's got a white beard.
[19:13.94]Speckles.
[19:19.15]There aren't many bosses now.
[19:20.19]They're just normal mobs.
[19:24.65]Well, that's kind of nuts.
[19:30.76]I got the items.
[19:31.74]Something wrong?
[19:35.92]What's going on?
[19:40.87]Come on here.
[19:47.27]Come on.
[19:50.81]Fucking game crashed.
[19:55.65]The game just literally crashed.
[20:01.15]I hope that's not... No.
[20:04.22]It should be fine.
[20:14.72]Are we getting Fs?
[20:15.93]Well, we're getting Fs.
[20:16.57]That was a hardware F. Because that almost just crashed my whole computer.
[20:23.11]That was not an internet F. Yeah, that was a hardware F. Damn, this is not running well either.
[20:41.64]This is bad.
[20:42.07]This is bad.
[20:46.66]Alright, well, whatever.
[20:54.47]Yeah, I know, I know, I know, whatever.
[21:01.95]Laugh my ass off.
[21:02.67]Elden Ring sucks.
[21:03.63]I think... So I'm... I just...
[21:16.31]Where the hell... Where am I?
[21:17.35]Why am I over here?
[21:22.43]Why did you put me over here?
[21:28.85]What?
[21:31.10]My souls are over there.
[21:32.02]Yeah, my souls are down here.
[21:38.62]What level am I?
[21:41.82]74, yeah.
[21:43.30]I think the game put me in a different place.
[21:48.21]I died I this is exactly where I died the game like crashed and like dumped me in another location Well alright, let's go Yeah, I mean there are there are some technical issues sometimes with the game, but whatever I'm gonna stop me from fucking playing
[22:15.75]I don't even care about these souls really.
[22:17.39]Was it like 5,000?
[22:17.73]2,000?
[22:17.77]Would you say that you love this... Oh, it's actually 10,000.
[22:26.02]Never mind.
[22:27.22]Would you say that you love this game?
[22:28.40]I don't think I'd be playing it as much as I am if I didn't.
[22:35.95]Really, really easy for you guys to know that considering.
[22:45.41]considering how much I play games on this stream.
[22:55.62]Me playing a video game for more than four hours and going, yeah, I'll play that tomorrow.
[23:01.93]Oh my God.
[23:04.13]Not paying attention.
[23:05.75]I played this game for more than two streams in a row, which means it's like the best game that's ever been made.
[23:09.45]Oh, there you go.
[23:15.61]Don't fucking crash again, yeah.
[23:17.91]No, we're good.
[23:18.43]Alright.
[23:18.77]No, come on, come on, come on.
[23:19.87]These guys hurt a lot.
[23:21.68]What's the damage they're doing?
[23:22.98]Like, thrust?
[23:28.96]If Jerma985, that's me, is gonna play your game for more than 10 hours on stream, you've got something really special.
[23:38.88]Real special.
[23:43.02]That does not, hold on, let me make, I gotta make it clear to you guys.
[23:45.72]That does not mean that I have some incredibly high standard.
[23:49.54]Like, wow, you're impressing me?
[23:50.68]Wow, what a feat that is.
[23:54.17]No, I'm saying that it's so difficult to hold my attention on anything, that you holding my attention is ridiculous.
[24:03.23]Like, is really actually impressive.
[24:06.43]Because stuff does not hold my attention that well.
[24:09.27]And it's not because it doesn't matter how good or bad something is.
[24:11.93]I usually move on very quickly to the next thing.
[24:17.07]I don't even want to fight these fucking things.
[24:26.75]What an ego.
[24:28.31]I'm telling you, it's not an ego thing.
[24:44.43]Okay.
[24:46.11]These guys do... How many souls each?
[24:49.23]Jesus, that's a lot.
[25:00.40]You referred to yourself in the third person.
[25:03.24]Yeah.
[25:04.36]As a joke, I don't actually do that.
[25:06.66]That's...
[25:13.04]That was a huge burp, and if I opened my mouth, I would've threw up.
[25:26.21]What a bad attention span.
[25:28.09]I do.
[25:28.61]I've had attention issues my whole life, man.
[25:32.53]Even going into my 40s.
[25:35.05]It's going to be... I'm not 40 yet, but you know what I mean?
[25:37.37]It's going to get even... I don't know.
[25:39.75]You know I'm really concerned.
[25:40.89]You want to know what my major concerns are?
[25:42.93]Kind of growing up and getting a lot older, older.
[25:46.33]So I have really bad attention problems.
[25:48.55]I have my whole life.
[25:49.91]I've taken medication for it.
[25:51.67]Decades ago, right?
[25:52.75]I've always kind of had issues that way.
[25:55.61]When you get older, you slow down.
[25:58.21]So, when I'm into my, like, mid-40s, into my, like, mid-50s, as my brain starts to slow down, am I gonna be able to, like, do- am I- am I gonna be able to think about anything?
[26:12.20]Like, I'm gonna have, like, bad ADHD and, like, dementia at the same time.
[26:17.33]Like, as everybody kind of slowly goes to that, like, kind of, like, degrading brain into, like, your 50s and 60s.
[26:23.89]That's gonna be really strange.
[26:26.57]I'm going to make sure I drink.
[26:27.55]I'm going to take a ton of vitamin E. I'm going to make sure I eat fish every day.
[26:33.52]Like seriously.
[26:34.42]Take care of yourselves.
[26:36.76]What am I doing?
[26:44.33]I just aggroed the whole camp.
[26:45.81]What am I thinking?
[26:58.64]I'm good.
[27:03.09]Attention deficit hyperactivity dementia.
[27:14.15]I mean, I'll be honest, that seems like, fuck, like, I don't know.
[27:17.90]I'm gonna make sure I'm gonna take, like, I'm gonna make sure I'm, like, eating right.
[27:34.88]Jesus!
[27:53.45]I thought he was behind the pillar.
[27:54.57]I actually thought he was behind the pillar.
[27:59.16]I changed that, by the way.
[28:01.44]Made that to heal over time instead of the stamina.
[28:03.24]Because stamina is not a problem.
[28:15.52]You shouldn't be eating four McChickens.
[28:24.65]Guys, okay.
[28:25.95]It's time for defense mode Andy.
[28:29.76]Just because my McDonald's order is a little elaborate is a little excessive.
[28:36.28]That's... What's going on?
[28:39.24]I thought that was an item.
[28:42.74]What's this?
[28:46.73]I don't order it every day.
[28:57.17]No, I'm not- I don't want to go down the fucking river.
[28:59.49]What the fuck?
[29:08.13]That'd be so- okay.
[29:09.75]Huge missed opportunity from FromSoftware.
[29:11.91]If you died, just showed up on screen right now.
[29:15.71]Just- Oh, that would be so funny.
[29:20.55]What a missed opportunity, unfortunately.
[29:32.12]I actually didn't want to go in there.
[29:33.26]You eat McDonald's every day?
[29:37.56]Eric.
[29:48.03]Now what?
[29:50.99]He eats more than my whole family of five.
[29:54.35]I am not eating that much McDonald's.
[29:59.75]Where the fuck am I?
[30:00.68]This is going to be like a boss.
[30:08.52]Please give me a bonfire so I can at least level up before I lose all these souls.
[30:24.16]Look, I love McDonald's.
[30:25.42]McDonald's is the absolute best.
[30:29.26]Nothing will ever compare.
[30:32.41]You know, it's kind of weird.
[30:35.11]I've been to five-star restaurants.
[30:37.93]I've eaten five-star meals.
[30:41.39]But the way that my brain reacts to eating, like if I'm hungry, a double cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[30:50.52]Nothing compares.
[30:51.90]Like that.
[30:52.72]I'm really hungry.
[30:53.82]Double cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[30:55.60]Bam.
[30:56.08]That four seconds.
[30:57.54]One, two, three, four.
[31:00.66]Nothing compares to that.
[31:01.66]And like, oh, what's this?
[31:03.98]Parsley dusted chicken thigh.
[31:07.57]I don't know.
[31:09.79]Whatever it is.
[31:10.95]And like, oh, interesting.
[31:15.25]Interesting flavors.
[31:18.53]Into the napkin.
[31:21.46]What do you have?
[31:32.25]Fuck, I don't... There's no bonfire.
[31:34.21]There's a statue, but I'm gonna lose 35,000 souls.
[31:41.32]No, I'm not doing it.
[31:42.94]I'm not doing it.
[31:53.61]I'm not doing it.
[31:54.17]I have a level.
[31:55.15]Why would I throw a level away?
[31:56.43]That's an extra point in intelligence.
[31:59.89]What are you, dumb?
[32:01.41]What are you, dumb?
[32:07.36]Now I'm just going to run past everybody.
[32:08.64]Do you have matcha today?
[32:19.56]Of course I do.
[32:23.44]Like there's, I would assume at this point there's more matcha powder fragments than red blood cells in my body.
[32:30.33]The last like two weeks.
[32:37.97]How come I'm in a public school bathroom?
[32:39.39]What are you talking about?
[32:41.03]Like right now?
[32:42.27]I don't know many public school bathrooms that have like shelves with like video games on them.
[32:55.27]Dude, okay.
[33:11.43]Does this actually kill you?
[33:12.57]I need to see, because if it doesn't, then I'm just gonna do it.
[33:14.76]No, it's gonna kill me.
[33:17.46]Heat-seeking missiles.
[33:18.52]Yeah, then they shoot a thousand of them.
[33:28.58]They're talking about where the game is right now.
[33:30.82]Oh.
[33:36.10]That seems... Public school bathroom.
[33:39.52]I swear to god if that kills me again.
[34:09.43]Okay.
[34:12.81]There was a chest here.
[34:19.14]Scorpion Stinger.
[34:22.09]Oh, that looks cool.
[34:22.95]Whatever that is.
[34:23.54]It's definitely not intelligence, but it's probably so cool.
[34:26.36]I gotta remember this for a future playthrough, because I probably would really like this.
[34:28.90]It's a dagger.
[34:29.80]Oh, it's a scarlet rot buildup.
[34:39.50]Oh, and it's got fuzz.
[34:41.90]This thing is hairy.
[34:48.46]This is awesome.
[34:54.39]And it does like this stinger slash.
[34:59.97]Alright.
[35:05.45]I like want to use this.
[35:13.48]That's so cool.
[35:14.50]Scorpion.
[35:16.52]Very cool, unfortunately.
[35:20.30]That's not the kind of character I'm playing.
[35:23.56]That's where it is, if you're wondering.
[35:27.45]Grand Cloister.
[35:29.25]What's the weapon info?
[35:31.21]The weapon info is... Okay.
[35:48.90]So that's all I need to do there.
[35:49.94]Now... I hope the flask allocation is good because this looks like a boss.
[35:56.22]So we're just gonna go... I don't care about those souls.
[35:58.42]Who cares?
[36:01.29]Go get in the coffin.
[36:05.61]It's literally like a thousand... I almost said shares.
[36:11.13]It's literally just a thousand shares.
[36:12.97]Doesn't matter.
[36:14.33]How many shares do I own of this?
[36:17.05]What do I mean shares?
[36:22.93]stalk Stanley okay here we go double headphones going in time for me to pay attention I appreciate everybody's help I appreciate everybody's you know hey dude you're doing pretty good hey dude you're doing awful but I'm gonna have I'm tuning you out for the next two three straight minutes there's a statue here so I can come back I have two eight and two I want hopefully it's enough I don't know
[36:54.57]uh in the Astel Naturalborn of the Void why does everybody have one of those can I can I complain why does every boss have that move they all have it they're like welcome to the arena boom
[37:25.36]This thing is great.
[37:25.94]It's like a whole solar system.
[37:29.49]Alright.
[37:37.51]A lot of big explosive AoE.
[37:39.19]You have to jump and hit.
[37:44.42]Yeah, you gotta jump.
[37:48.66]You're so big.
[37:49.44]I can't even...
[37:52.69]Aw.
[37:53.21]Oh my god.
[37:53.61]Okay, so that does one, two, three.
[38:06.56]Jesus.
[38:07.24]Okay.
[38:09.22]You have so many moves.
[38:11.70]You have that too?
[38:13.14]Okay.
[38:13.54]And that's not magic.
[38:15.00]That's not magical at all.
[38:17.60]That's not magical at all.
[38:24.42]That was not magical at all.
[38:27.76]This is crazy looking boss though.
[38:31.84]Okay.
[38:32.86]Well, very interesting.
[38:38.87]This is probably one of the cooler looking bosses I think that they've made.
[38:43.23]There was a tier list for interesting boss look, like design.
[38:47.05]A lot longer than that.
[38:50.81]I think this guy would be up pretty high.
[38:55.92]that's oh man that's hard it does like it comes down but it doesn't hit Jesus okay he goes like before he does it
[39:28.71]Fuck, I was out of stamina.
[39:34.33]Fuck.
[39:38.77]Oh!
[39:38.93]Maybe... Maybe I shouldn't hit him in the face.
[39:46.60]I wish I hit him like inside.
[39:47.80]Oh my God.
[39:49.00]He doesn't like that.
[39:49.62]Okay.
[40:05.47]He's got like 15 move, 20 plus moves and counting.
[40:10.28]This is going to be fun.
[40:16.58]He's just a nerd's rope.
[40:21.68]Oh yeah, wicked cool dude.
[40:22.89]He's a nerd's rope with like fangs.
[40:27.19]I think you can outrun it.
[40:28.01]Let me see if you can outrun it.
[40:29.23]Nerd's rope.
[40:32.69]Nerd's rope.
[40:42.74]Maybe, like, in his back legs.
[40:44.46]I think facing him head on is way too dangerous.
[40:49.68]Maybe I can, like, break one of his little... He's got these, like, little crab legs.
[40:54.27]I should be able to break them.
[40:55.39]Maybe I can stun him.
[40:59.29]How are you supposed to get the fuck away from that?
[41:02.15]That's an instant kill move.
[41:04.83]Of course.
[41:05.33]Of course, this is Elden Ring.
[41:07.09]Every major boss has an instant kill move.
[41:09.69]I forgot.
[41:10.39]I forgot what video game I was playing.
[41:17.48]okay I wonder can I dodge that when he does it like right before he does it maybe I cannot use the horse here unfortunately I'm still gonna go for the legs I think the back legs you get these little tiny little like lobster legs I think I can probably like hurt them or break them
[41:44.89]I don't think so.
[41:53.60]Maybe not.
[41:55.00]It's definitely his head.
[42:02.00]It's absolutely his head that hurts the most.
[42:04.80]Right in his cracked skull.
[42:19.23]Jesus.
[42:40.78]Fuck.
[42:41.02]I couldn't see where his arm was.
[42:44.34]I wonder how much magic damage I'll do.
[42:45.80]Let's try it.
[42:52.41]Oh baby!
[42:54.33]That's a lot.
[43:10.81]Shit!
[43:37.04]Should I go in now?
[43:44.65]hey alright alright alright
[44:11.07]Where?
[44:43.55]What the fuck?
[44:45.73]Hey, yeah, that move sucks.
[44:47.41]I have that too.
[44:48.11]It's terrible.
[44:57.07]Shit.
[45:01.69]What the fuck is that thing?
[45:07.71]Oh, fuck you.
[45:25.85]so
[45:45.31]Oh shit, in my pants!
[45:53.12]Oh my god, it did it fucking three times.
[45:58.14]Oh my god, it does it three times again.
[46:01.73]Get out, get out, don't be over here.
[46:04.87]Get away from him, there's no reason to be there.
[46:08.84]okay that's what I was talking about we're fine so
[46:36.02]Holy shit.
[46:36.90]What?
[46:38.30]Don't die from that.
[46:39.12]Don't die from that.
[46:39.70]I got enough.
[46:40.76]I don't have enough.
[46:47.57]He appeared fucking behind.
[46:48.79]I didn't know where he was going.
[46:50.85]Alright.
[46:51.11]Well, here's the thing.
[46:53.41]Here's the thing.
[46:55.33]I can get him.
[46:58.62]I should have brought an extra.
[47:00.82]I'll get him.
[47:10.39]I thought I had him.
[47:12.15]Alright, I'm getting it.
[47:13.45]But that sucks.
[47:15.01]It's too fast.
[47:16.53]Alright, let's go.
[47:22.46]I might... If I don't beat him in the next couple of tries... I may... Dude, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[47:44.92]Oh fuck.
[48:04.43]so so so so
[48:33.15]Oh, that was a close one.
[49:13.11]That shit took up the whole script.
[49:57.18]Thank you.
[50:33.19]No!
[50:33.65]Fuck you, dude!
[50:34.85]It's so hard to- No!
[50:35.69]I don't think I'm dead!
[50:36.35]I'm alive!
[50:37.59]Oh my god!
[50:38.63]Fuck that move, dude!
[50:42.53]Like, he just- He appears fucking somewhere behind you, and it's like you lose lock on, and he's just right in your fucking face!
[50:51.28]That move is so stupid!
[50:57.45]Come on.
[51:01.41]That's fucking dumb.
[51:02.75]That's stupid.
[51:03.77]Because, like, where the fuck even is he going to be?
[51:09.40]He's behind you.
[51:10.08]You lose lock on.
[51:12.08]And then he's just right on your ass.
[51:13.56]Like, dude, should I just spam dodge?
[51:16.52]He'll catch me.
[51:17.80]It's such fucking horse shit.
[51:20.73]Oh.
[51:33.49]I think I'm dead.
[51:36.03]Insta-kill moves are fucking dumb.
[51:37.49]I don't care.
[52:03.60]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[52:07.31]It's just gonna come down to, like, when he does that shit.
[52:11.05]I guess just, no matter where he is, just instantly dodge?
[52:16.44]I don't, I, is he, I don't, I have no idea.
[52:28.68]Oh, fuck.
[52:29.70]Did that twice in a row.
[52:39.59]No, I'm just tilting.
[52:40.81]It's over.
[52:41.15]Yeah, I'm just tilting.
[52:46.69]I'm just full tilt because of that fucking dumb grab move.
[53:18.64]The gravity... No, the gravity move is not instant kill.
[53:20.48]It's just like an 80%.
[53:23.20]The grab move might actually be instant kill.
[53:26.54]Or at least like 95% or something.
[53:28.40]I don't know.
[53:30.06]What do I have?
[53:30.55]30 vitality?
[53:34.59]That was the one, too.
[53:35.49]It's just so fucking frustrating.
[54:00.05]Thank you.
[54:29.00]That was close.
[55:06.51]Okay, okay, okay, okay
[55:20.16]I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AND I FUCKING- Where are they?
[55:30.67]Thank you.
[56:01.28]Thank you for watching.
[56:33.78]Where'd he go?
[57:13.28]What the fuck is that thing?
[57:33.34]Trying to bait out the base pit.
[58:12.36]Oh yes fuck Oh
[58:56.56]Where the fuck am I?
[59:26.89]Oh, bro!
[59:27.35]I'm alive.
[59:29.61]I'm gonna be alive.
[59:30.17]I'm gonna be alive.
[59:31.05]I'm gonna be alive.
[59:52.14]WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
[59:52.92]I'M AGAINST A FUCKING GODDAMN SKYBOX WALL!
[59:55.56]I'M AGAINST A WALL!
[59:56.10]THERE'S A WALL!
[60:08.82]Shit.
[60:16.32]Oh fuck you, game.
[60:26.29]Shit.
[60:48.72]No!
[61:16.33]Thank you.
[62:04.55]AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
[62:37.07]Game's fucking easy.
[62:37.85]It's not even a hard game.
[62:38.79]Instant kill moves are stupid.
[62:39.93]Delete them.
[62:40.77]Pass them out of the game.
[62:41.45]Instant kill moves are fucking stupid.
[62:42.39]Delete them from the game.
[62:43.04]Instant kill moves.
[62:43.56]You should never have put those in the game.
[62:45.00]They're fucking stupid.
[62:45.76]Nobody likes them.
[62:46.36]Nobody.
[62:46.62]Not one person likes them.
[62:54.42]Like, you remember when Jay Leno used to walk around on the street and be like, oh, hey, so what do you think about like this?
[62:59.40]Hey, what do you think about like a Chevy?
[63:01.62]Right, no, no, no.
[63:02.30]If it was like, oh, hey, I got a question for you.
[63:04.58]In a video game, if something could kill you in one hit instantly, do you like it?
[63:10.52]No, no, and I don't know.
[63:12.01]No, Jay Leno, I don't like it.
[63:14.03]Oh, well, we got another person here.
[63:15.27]What do you think about instant kill moves in games?
[63:17.89]I fucking hate them.
[63:18.53]They should never be in a video game.
[63:21.19]We're getting interesting responses.
[63:33.07]I hate them!
[63:35.31]It's like one little move, and it's like... Even if it's not... I know that it is, though.
[63:42.06]It is.
[63:46.88]Your health is just too low.
[63:47.80]He doesn't have any instant kill moves.
[63:50.32]Okay.
[63:51.16]If I... If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead!
[64:01.85]You're probably going to... Not you, I'm just saying, like, if somebody were to, like, push you into a meat grinder, and, like, one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not going to pick it up and go, well, see?
[64:14.58]It wasn't an instant kill move.
[64:17.54]You still got, like, this part of your finger left.
[64:24.50]I'm not gonna put you into a me-crunch.
[64:26.84]I'm not gonna put you into a me-crunch.
[64:30.06]No, I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if I, like, if I were to get, like, fucking killed, I don't know.
[64:39.28]You know what I'm saying.
[64:47.68]If, okay, if you were to, no, okay, we're gonna take humans out of this.
[64:52.15]If Alien Glob-Glob-Glob-Glo 1... Fucking shoots a disintegrating ray at Alien Glob-Glo 2... If there's only fucking teeth left... It's fucking... You're dead!
[65:07.46]You're dead!
[65:08.08]If I were to put you in a meat rocket... God damn it!
[65:21.17]That's so fucked up.
[65:30.67]You don't understand what I'm saying though.
[65:31.81]I'm not actually saying I'm going to put somebody in a meat grinder.
[65:34.79]God damn it.
[65:44.70]Whatever.
[65:46.40]Let's go.
[65:54.43]What's the context?
[65:55.27]The context is, if he does 95% of your health in one move, it's... It's still the same.
[66:03.40]Because who... I want you to find... Do me a favor.
[66:06.28]Find somebody that plays this game that has 100% HP.
[66:07.88]No one's at 100% HP.
[66:08.26]100% HP.
[66:08.56]Usually people are at like 80, or like 90, or like 85.
[66:11.14]You can never get it right.
[66:21.09]A 90 plus percent damage move is effectively killing you.
[66:24.76]You're dead.
[66:27.48]MonkaS, I agree.
[66:32.26]I fucking... I had to use the meat grinder analogy, but it works.
[66:42.07]Still not an instant kill.
[66:45.57]Okay.
[66:46.77]Fine.
[66:54.45]Alright, well that was fun.
[66:57.42]I wonder if I should start doing this.
[67:00.17]Is it 40?
[67:02.73]Let's play.
[67:07.35]Don't grind me up.
[67:08.99]No, whenever... Okay.
[67:10.67]Whenever I say you, I mean, like, collectively, like, a thing.
[67:15.18]Right?
[67:15.38]Like, you don't... Like, let me tell you something.
[67:16.96]You know?
[67:17.44]Like, I say you know.
[67:18.30]Like, you know?
[67:19.24]I don't actually... I don't actually know if you know.
[67:21.98]I'm just saying you.
[67:23.58]Like, yeah.
[67:24.26]Like, you know?
[67:24.86]You?
[67:25.60]Collectively, you know?
[67:26.46]You.
[67:26.85]Like, if you... You know, if you did... You know, if you... Trust me.
[67:30.37]No one's going to be crying.
[67:31.73]I promise.
[67:36.31]Now what do I do?
[67:54.27]He means you specifically.
[68:08.07]Uh, I can go.
[68:08.63]I can go back.
[68:09.17]So what did I get?
[68:11.50]This is part of the quest for... Oh, there's a place I can go.
[68:20.18]Are you going to play the new Destiny 2?
[68:22.12]That joke was like three months in the making, and it already happened, so I'm sorry.
[68:25.86]You're never going to see that ever again.
[68:52.68]Hey, dude, like, um, it's actually not an instant kill move.
[68:56.10]If I were to put you in a meat grinder!
[68:58.04]Whoa!
[69:00.76]Whoa!
[69:06.49]I'm sorry!
[69:07.73]I didn't, I was just talking, I was, like, turning, I was just speaking collectively, like, just, like, a thing that happens.
[69:21.63]Oh, man.
[69:24.33]God damn it.
[69:26.57]I'm going to take this to the grave, though.
[69:28.07]Like 95... Sorry, like 95 plus percent damage moves.
[69:34.92]I got to move on.
[69:37.28]I got to move on right now.
[69:38.72]I have to... I'm going to move on right now.
[69:40.92]So we're going to continue to play.
[69:42.00]We're going to just keep playing.
[69:43.92]Elden Ring.
[69:44.70]Elden Ring.
[69:45.16]No meat grinders.
[69:45.88]Nobody's going in a meat grinder.
[69:47.52]Like...
[69:48.20]I beat the boss.
[69:49.04]It was hard.
[69:49.56]He was crazy.
[69:50.72]I got a little tilted in the middle there.
[69:52.74]But no, there's no meat grinders anymore.
[69:54.34]Look at all these pigs.
[69:55.20]They're actually interesting.
[70:04.63]Stop it.
[70:05.79]Stop it.
[70:06.21]Okay.
[70:07.99]This is... I actually wanted to explore this area.
[70:10.27]Why don't we explore?
[70:11.17]Let's take a quick look around.
[70:13.07]Oh, look at this thing over here.
[70:14.37]We're gonna mark some stuff on the map because that's what we do in Elden Ring.
[70:17.90]Let's check out some stuff.
[70:19.82]Uh, new zone.
[70:21.88]There's a few places I think look kind of interesting here.
[70:23.86]Uh, there's a farm over there too, but guys, I think we're gonna check this out first.
[70:31.45]We're gonna check that out first just to see what's over here.
[70:35.87]We'll start with, uh, this one.
[70:37.09]I think this is a church.
[70:38.13]Potentially get a sacred flask.
[70:49.72]What the fuck?
[70:50.76]I don't want to fight you.
[70:52.28]I don't want to fight a glintstone dragon right now.
[70:59.10]I just had a boss fight.
[71:05.45]Who did you just kill?
[71:06.33]Was that an NPC?
[71:07.63]I hope that wasn't an NPC.
[71:15.45]Oh my god.
[71:21.32]Oh my god.
[71:22.18]That's a glintstone dragon.
[71:27.18]Of course magic's not going to do well against a glintstone dragon.
[71:39.29]What was I thinking?
[71:43.92]This is a really bad place to fight a dragon.
[71:46.96]Actually.
[71:53.39]I don't know what's going to happen here, but okay.
[71:55.75]That hurt.
[72:15.81]I'm not fighting this thing.
[72:16.95]I'm still shook up from the last one.
[72:19.41]I do need my souls though.
[72:20.99]I want to see what's in there.
[72:26.90]Put him in the meat grinder.
[72:27.86]It's going to take a while for this community to get over that one.
[72:36.77]Oh, it is a cathedral.
[72:48.59]Starlight shards.
[72:52.28]Starlight shards.
[72:54.18]Starlight shards.
[72:55.10]Starlight shards.
[72:55.86]These are everywhere.
[73:04.40]These are rare.
[73:07.28]They're purple lights.
[73:08.12]That means it's rare.
[73:20.25]Neat grinder.
[73:20.89]Apology.
[73:34.90]Okay, so... Let's get all these.
[73:37.46]Why not?
[73:37.80]These are a pretty rare resource.
[73:47.91]Starlight Shards.
[73:48.75]I'm gonna look it up in a minute.
[73:49.85]Let's get this.
[73:52.91]Dude, I wouldn't even apologize.
[73:54.35]I spent the last, like, 20 straight minutes apologizing.
[73:57.91]We're talking about me grinding people.
[74:00.00]But my point still stood very solid, I think.
[74:16.16]Okay.
[74:18.94]Very cool.
[74:19.82]That was what was here.
[74:22.66]Ooh.
[74:26.87]Wait a minute.
[74:27.27]Are there ruins under here?
[74:32.51]There is.
[74:34.97]What?
[74:40.26]Am I dead?
[74:40.62]Am I going here?
[74:44.85]There's a ledge.
[74:45.25]There's a ledge.
[74:47.87]There's a ledge.
[74:48.39]There's a ledge.
[74:48.89]There's a ledge.
[74:49.37]There's a ledge.
[74:51.01]And I have starlight.
[74:57.76]I'm gonna put that on.
[74:58.66]Okay, let's do it.
[75:21.93]What keeps dying here?
[75:30.33]Oh, thank God for Starlight.
[75:33.26]What is this?
[75:43.10]Sting?
[75:52.46]It's a hand, it's one of those fingers.
[76:07.38]Clear ring.
[76:08.24]This guy, all that's left of this guy is his fucking hand.
[76:18.40]All that a kill move?
[76:19.68]Is that an instant kill move?
[76:21.12]Or does his hand still exist?
[76:22.60]Alright, I'm moving on.
[76:23.32]No more talking about this.
[76:27.26]I'm kind of afraid of this.
[76:28.12]Should I put the... I don't want to put the ring on, though.
[76:29.86]The ring raids will come get me.
[76:35.15]I feel like this is bad.
[76:39.43]Wait, that's Renna.
[77:02.53]Oh, I thought I was going to take that ring that she had on and take it off and put it on me.
[77:07.05]I look, this is so out of place.
[77:20.23]I look like I belong in like a fucking Saturday morning funnies page in the paper.
[77:24.29]I don't belong in this scene.
[77:37.58]Oh.
[77:40.61]So Renna's back.
[77:42.93]So it was thee who would become my lord.
[77:46.91]Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.
[77:49.51]I am pleased, however.
[77:52.35]Thou art a fitting choice.
[77:55.09]I go now to the night sky.
[77:58.19]It is there I shall find mine order.
[78:01.00]I bid thee travel the path of the lord.
[78:04.80]And once all is done,
[78:07.50]Alright.
[78:14.49]Very cool.
[78:16.21]Ways my reward.
[78:18.27]Here it is.
[78:21.46]Dark Moon Greatsword.
[78:34.45]Dude, this is so... But 16 strength?
[78:37.65]What is this?
[78:41.53]It's the FromSoftware weapon.
[78:47.38]This is how you get the Moonlight Greatsword.
[78:50.46]It's the FromSoftware weapon.
[78:52.20]We found the FromSoftware weapon.
[78:56.66]Okay.
[78:58.04]Let's take a look at it.
[79:01.36]It's very pretty, isn't it?
[79:06.27]It is.
[79:12.83]It is very pretty.
[79:13.81]That does not use mana, by the way.
[79:23.86]How long does it last?
[79:30.02]Ooh, looks really cool here.
[79:43.74]I don't think you have an option here.
[79:46.77]I mean... I think I do have an option considering I need 16 strength.
[79:54.21]Which... I'm going to have the intelligence for it.
[79:58.35]It is THE intelligence weapon.
[80:06.82]Yeah, but this is too.
[80:10.21]You can just two-hand it.
[80:14.23]Yeah, but then I'm essentially obliterating all my sorceries.
[80:17.53]Put on the strength talisman.
[80:23.94]This actually lasts a while.
[80:28.46]Alright, so what happens if it's just a normal two-hander?
[80:36.52]Okay, I have some decisions to make because this is a big deal.
[80:40.28]I'm going to give you one reason why I'm not too keen on using this item.
[80:46.10]It's because for the entire video game, I have been... I have these swinging patterns down with the one-handed.
[80:54.63]And even two-handed, it's a lot faster.
[80:57.89]I don't know.
[81:02.11]I'm going to have to get used to this all new swing timing with a big two-hander.
[81:14.19]It's very cool.
[81:15.15]I don't know.
[81:15.87]I don't know.
[81:17.19]I don't know.
[81:17.71]It's a slow swinger.
[81:21.69]Yeah.
[81:23.11]I don't know.
[81:25.41]Well, let me finish this up.
[81:27.13]Let me just continue to do what I was doing here.
[81:31.19]That also, is that going to make me heavy?
[81:32.79]This is important.
[81:37.21]Guys.
[81:42.92]I, unless I don't have anything in my offhand, this is heavy.
[81:46.08]It's a heavy load.
[81:46.86]I'd have to start putting points in endurance.
[81:50.08]I can't have an offhand.
[81:55.70]Unless I respec, I don't think this is happening.
[82:01.47]I'm more inclined to go into this than I am to that.
[82:06.88]This thing is pretty cool as well.
[82:09.54]It does this thing.
[82:11.42]Oh, hold on.
[82:16.72]This thing's awesome.
[82:23.43]But, I don't know.
[82:26.85]Because that's strength int, not dex int.
[82:29.55]But it does scale with dex.
[82:31.36]It does.
[82:33.18]And it's frost?
[82:35.92]Alright.
[82:36.28]Well, we're going to have to do a lot of soul searching here, I think.
[82:39.18]Yeah, it's going to take some... Because this is what I'm going to take into the endgame.
[82:43.07]Whatever I'm taking to the second half of this game is what I'm going to be using for the whole game.
[82:49.29]So, this is going to be interesting.
[82:52.12]Because I actually don't know what to do here.
[83:01.64]But, in the meantime, let's do this.
[83:03.84]Anything else down here?
[83:08.80]That was a really cool quest line.
[83:20.99]In the meantime, I can go further.
[83:23.15]I can go further down, can't I?
[83:25.12]I can.
[83:26.66]Wait.
[83:27.56]Wait.
[83:29.36]Didn't I come from down?
[83:30.13]I think I came from this way.
[83:32.55]Yeah, okay, I did.
[83:38.36]What if I go back to Ren's Rise?
[83:39.54]That's a good idea.
[83:40.76]You're gonna get plenty of materials to spec several weapons really high.
[83:49.90]Yeah, but if this is like the other FromSoftware games, and I'm imagining it is because, you know, instant kill move.
[83:58.25]If it's like the other FromSoftware games, there's probably only like three or four of like the plus 10 or plus 20, whatever item.
[84:10.22]So I'm imagining there's probably less than five or less than maybe even three.
[84:14.70]There was two.
[84:15.02]There was two.
[84:17.03]In each playthrough of Bloodborne, I remember, like, the super gigantic plus ten item.
[84:21.33]I imagine there's probably two or three.
[84:24.28]There are more than four?
[84:26.96]There's four.
[84:29.88]Okay, so it's not like the other ones.
[84:32.50]Because I remember the other ones, it was like, you're gonna find... Maybe two of, like, the super Titanite, like, mega slabs, and that was it.
[84:40.79]Okay.
[84:41.71]So there's enough.
[84:42.67]Alright, well then, then it's not, and I'm not worried about it then.
[84:48.38]I want to keep exploring this area, though.
[84:55.15]Got that.
[84:56.23]I didn't... Yeah, I want to check out some of this other stuff.
[84:59.05]Because I'm probably not coming back to this island ever again.
[85:07.63]But if you're wondering how to get the Moonlight Greatsword, like, if you don't feel like looking at a guide, it's Renna's questline.
[85:17.08]That was a long, winded journey.
[85:22.98]Get us to a spot that I'm not entirely sure.
[85:28.02]I don't know if I want to use it.
[85:30.16]Okay, well.
[85:38.64]Alright.
[85:41.76]Ooh, golden.
[85:46.65]Is this one single person?
[85:53.14]That's one single person.
[86:03.84]Holy shit!
[86:04.72]Okay, I did not take that seriously enough.
[86:09.06]Why did I start freaking out?
[86:14.59]Where's this gonna take me?
[86:15.91]I just, like, Don Cholani just was doing that.
[86:17.81]Okay, um... Where's this gonna take me?
[86:21.21]Should I do... Was there a statue?
[86:24.51]Or is this gonna take me back way before?
[86:26.25]I don't know.
[86:26.81]I don't remember.
[86:41.36]Okay, yeah, it's here.
[86:43.36]Well.
[86:43.58]Alright.
[86:45.86]Nope.
[86:46.48]Do not.
[86:47.36]Do not just nonchalantly walk through that area.
[86:49.77]I want to be in there.
[86:58.37]Ooh.
[86:59.84]That's pretty.
[87:02.58]Alright.
[87:04.20]I want to go underground.
[87:04.94]There's definitely a dungeon here that I'm going to do.
[87:08.09]And after I do this island, I'm gonna go do a main story place.
[87:12.95]Which I'm gonna go to Caelid, I think.
[87:14.97]And go up from Caelid.
[87:18.35]That's my plan.
[87:19.19]If you don't like my plan, then... I don't care.
[87:24.69]Alright, let's take this more seriously.
[87:27.96]Holy fucking shit.
[87:36.10]Oh my...
[87:40.33]Okay.
[87:40.65]Kinda got stuck in the wall.
[87:55.17]That guy can't even be in the game.
[87:57.07]He's just like bugging out and freaking out.
[87:59.61]Okay.
[88:03.11]Damn.
[88:04.05]Alright.
[88:04.54]Well, let's try this again.
[88:10.37]Let me get off the horse.
[88:11.09]I feel like maybe that's better.
[88:13.33]Or is it, though?
[88:16.41]So many people spawn here.
[88:18.01]Alright, let's go.
[88:29.12]He appears behind you.
[88:36.01]Jesus.
[88:52.92]He's making the bird sounds, by the way.
[88:54.36]He's making the FromSoftware bird reverse suck in breathing sound.
[89:07.69]Holy shit!
[89:08.99]Dude, I don't even know when I should attack him.
[89:20.34]I drove into a fucking telephone pole.
[89:21.96]Like, fuck you.
[89:30.18]Fuck, man!
[89:33.04]Where is he?
[89:38.83]Fuck!
[89:42.03]What the fuck?!
[89:43.89]I'm alive, but... No!
[89:46.11]Jesus!
[89:49.71]Okay, um... I want to kill this guy just because he's fucking irritating.
[90:05.91]Get off the horse?
[90:06.79]Oh, I think that is guaranteed death.
[90:10.11]You see how fast this guy moves around and he like teleports?
[90:12.49]No way you fight this guy off the horse.
[90:21.20]I'll dodge roll once and get killed.
[90:24.80]Dude.
[90:29.96]Oh my god.
[90:30.88]This is harder than some of the bosses.
[90:32.42]Okay.
[90:41.54]Can I parry him?
[90:42.02]I don't think there's anything to parry.
[90:43.14]Good luck.
[90:45.08]Get off the horse, please.
[90:47.68]I'm telling you right now, I'm going to die in literally one second.
[90:51.38]If I get off the horse.
[90:54.31]But I'll do it.
[91:18.79]I can't even fucking take a second to drink.
[91:22.79]I can't even take a sip of my fucking flask.
[91:41.71]I wish I could summon a friend here.
[91:42.85]Alright, we're gonna stay on the horse.
[91:49.75]Because there's no way I'm gonna reliably and he'll teleport behind me and fucking kill me.
[91:55.85]And I'll complain.
[91:56.45]And I don't think you want to hear me complain.
[92:07.46]He literally blended into the ground.
[92:10.12]I can't even get up.
[92:13.66]What the fuck?
[92:17.47]How did he get over that?
[92:22.59]How did he get over the wall?
[92:23.65]Alright, I think I'm taking out my boy.
[92:32.66]My boy Oleg's coming out here for this one.
[92:41.86]No, you know what?
[92:42.86]Let's bring out the boys.
[92:56.71]We can be annoying too.
[93:06.05]Oh shit.
[93:10.00]Where is he?
[93:11.12]Where is he?
[93:16.58]My god Which way to me is he No get away from me
[93:47.65]There's so much fucking shit in the way, too.
[93:49.54]Like, seriously.
[93:50.22]Like, how am I supposed to... This enemy...
[94:19.77]Wait, can he get up here?
[94:22.44]Yeah, he can.
[94:47.90]Motherfucker, when can I even attack him?
[94:56.97]Fuck off!
[95:14.62]What an asshole.
[95:16.04]What an asshole of an enemy.
[95:18.09]Oh, good thing I got the Ghost Glove Warp.
[95:24.86]Oh, no, no, please!
[95:25.92]Uh-oh.
[95:26.28]Ooh, there's one of those things.
[95:45.21]Wash your hands?
[95:46.23]I...
[95:49.76]I'll wash up in a minute.
[95:55.22]What?
[95:56.40]I'm sitting here.
[95:57.86]Wait, you guys want me to go wash my hands?
[96:03.23]Should I go wash my hands?
[96:13.01]No one's touching this besides me.
[96:14.95]And I'm going to clean it with alcohol wipes after this.
[96:17.82]Don't worry.
[96:19.13]You must... Oh, God!
[96:23.15]Should I wash my hands?
[96:25.33]What if I wash... No!
[96:26.29]This is where this goes wrong.
[96:28.33]If I go wash my hands right now, I've grabbed onto this.
[96:31.63]I need to wash the controller.
[96:33.90]Don't you get it?
[96:34.34]I have to wash the controller, too?
[96:37.22]I'm going to do that afterwards.
[96:41.84]My monitor's not covered.
[96:42.82]It looks fine.
[96:44.02]Alright.
[96:45.42]I want to do this.
[96:47.60]I don't know why this is here.
[96:59.05]What?
[97:09.44]What was that for?
[97:17.03]What was that for?
[97:29.69]That took a long time.
[97:33.05]Why did that take so long?
[97:42.73]Alright, something cool.
[97:43.35]Let's go.
[97:46.96]It's really an Amber medallion +2.
[97:51.94]Holy shit.
[98:00.44]That's a hundred percent more mana.
[98:19.23]Fastly raises maximum FP.
[98:22.83]Wait.
[98:25.04]Oh.
[98:26.68]Never mind.
[98:27.18]It's 10.
[98:37.86]Why is this even in the game?
[98:48.46]This is the plus 2 version of this.
[98:55.53]How many levels is 11 FP?
[98:57.71]So it's 10%.
[98:58.05]I mean, that's maybe 1 point?
[99:01.95]Maybe 2 points?
[99:03.97]Maybe?
[99:14.64]I wouldn't consider that vast.
[99:21.30]About two levels.
[99:26.38]It's three or four points.
[99:30.05]That's really not a big debt.
[99:32.11]For how good some of the other talismans are in the game, there's no reason to put that on ever.
[99:38.93]I could see how that would maybe be okay if you were putting more than 20, 30 plus points in mine, but why would you ever do that?
[99:48.49]I can't think of a reason why you'd have more than, like, 40 points in mind.
[99:52.13]Disappointing.
[99:57.28]I used a key for that.
[99:58.08]Oh well.
[100:07.36]You said there's a fake wall?
[100:08.56]Is there?
[100:08.78]Are you fucking with me?
[100:31.72]Please can you do a quick Seinfeld routine about the word vast?
[100:39.75]What even is vast?
[100:40.53]What's that supposed to mean, vast?
[100:42.71]Just say big!
[100:43.76]Just say large!
[100:45.08]Say big!
[100:47.79]Why do we need names for so, why do we have so many names to describe what is effectively big?
[100:53.22]Just say big.
[100:53.96]Oh my god, okay, it's bear.
[101:25.03]Horrible.
[101:27.01]He screamed at me.
[101:30.21]Alright, there was a couple other places I wanted to go.
[101:31.87]I wanted to go here.
[101:32.55]To, uh... He vastly underperformed.
[101:48.90]He didn't perform well.
[101:51.12]He largely underperformed.
[101:53.37]The vast ocean.
[101:55.46]It's a big ocean.
[101:56.89]The ocean's big.
[101:58.59]That's a good one.
[101:59.33]It really is.
[101:59.79]Because, you know, he would, like, stay that way.
[102:02.95]He would move his hand.
[102:04.51]He'd move his hand like this.
[102:06.66]I don't want to fight this thing.
[102:07.74]I just want to look at the ruins.
[102:08.60]Because there's something under here that has to be here.
[102:33.21]There has to be something here that's not just... Look at... Yeah, of course.
[102:37.63]There's something here.
[102:43.01]Underneath, under the ground.
[102:44.41]Up above.
[102:47.56]There's something up above.
[102:49.48]Oh, we already... Yep, yep.
[102:50.34]Never mind.
[102:50.68]I already did this.
[102:51.30]I already did this.
[102:54.48]Oops.
[102:55.82]Sorry about that.
[102:56.44]Alright.
[102:57.48]We need to go here and here.
[103:00.08]And... Yeah.
[103:02.37]Okay.
[103:02.49]Okay.
[103:03.20]Yeah.
[103:04.30]One and four.
[103:04.84]Let's go.
[103:08.44]Oh, yuck.
[103:14.55]That's gonna... I'm gonna die if I do that.
[103:15.83]Don't be stupid.
[103:16.35]I'll go to one.
[103:28.43]Donald and Goofy.
[103:29.21]Donald and Goofy.
[103:30.59]It's Donald and it's Goofy.
[103:40.56]Is your shirt drenched?
[103:42.40]I don't think so.
[103:44.88]It probably isn't.
[103:45.48]I haven't been playing for that long.
[103:50.17]Just de-aggro, please.
[103:53.89]My shirt is not drenched.
[103:57.33]It's fucking fine.
[103:58.92]See?
[104:10.49]What?
[104:12.35]Is this a different dragon?
[104:15.52]Why is he here now?
[104:16.72]What?
[104:17.02]Why are there two?
[104:19.80]Why are there two of them?
[104:25.82]Is it a different person?
[104:27.49]You're not fighting me.
[104:29.25]Is it a different dragon?
[104:30.07]This one doesn't have a health bar.
[104:31.63]Okay, that's just an enemy.
[104:35.73]But what?
[104:38.09]That one doesn't have...
[104:41.51]Oh my god, it is a different dragon.
[104:44.19]They're everywhere.
[104:46.12]What?
[104:47.88]I'm sorry, but excuse me?
[104:49.48]Holy shit.
[104:57.01]Don't die from that.
[104:58.41]I'm fine.
[105:01.29]The island of dragons.
[105:04.67]Alright, now we go this way.
[105:11.89]Not these guys again.
[105:17.47]No, you know what?
[105:18.21]Fuck off.
[105:21.39]No, I'm not fighting any of these people.
[105:24.45]I do like the... They make a really cool sound.
[105:41.25]What are you doing here?
[105:42.17]This is the island of mini-bosses.
[105:45.13]Okay.
[105:45.83]I'm... Smithing Stone.
[105:49.07]I'm safe right here.
[105:49.87]Come on.
[106:07.19]Fuck, he's coming in.
[106:08.78]He's getting in.
[106:10.12]He's getting in.
[106:25.44]Oh, fuck, he got in.
[106:26.61]He got in.
[106:29.49]Okay, now he can't get out.
[106:30.35]This is perfect.
[106:48.22]Get away from me!
[106:49.76]Get away from me!
[106:51.22]Get away from me!
[106:53.76]What the fuck?! !
[107:10.01]This island might be too hard for you.
[107:19.81]No, that was not that sound.
[107:21.61]That was a different one.
[107:25.21]There's got to be a better way I can get down here.
[107:26.87]I don't want to go all the way around.
[107:31.62]That was not the... Dude, dude, dude, dude.
[107:33.82]That was the crystal people.
[107:39.09]A guy with a spear that goes wham.
[107:41.39]Wham.
[107:42.37]Wham.
[107:43.49]That's what he does.
[107:44.27]That's a different character.
[107:45.60]Grow up.
[107:50.44]Okay.
[107:51.84]Now I'm gonna wrap around.
[108:06.85]Why are you telling us to grow up?
[108:07.94]It should be you that grows up.
[108:09.40]I'm already a grown up.
[108:12.22]I'm a grown up.
[108:12.78]You're not a grown up.
[108:13.82]I'm a grown up.
[108:17.29]Missed a spell off the edge.
[108:18.01]We gotta go all the way around.
[108:19.65]There's no safe way.
[108:35.72]And what?
[108:36.00]Be old like you?
[108:37.98]I'm not even old.
[108:39.52]You can say that in five years.
[108:40.76]Because then I'll be into my early 40s.
[108:45.34]But I'm not old right now.
[108:47.18]I'm a young man.
[108:50.76]I'm into skateboarding.
[108:51.52]Okay.
[109:02.38]I don't want to get killed here.
[109:05.87]That's 20,000 souls.
[109:06.81]I gotta go get it.
[109:07.45]I gotta.
[109:09.23]I can't just leave it.
[109:10.03]That'd be such a... Like, what a fucking idiot that would be.
[109:14.79]What a... What a motherfucking idiot that would be if I didn't go get these souls.
[109:34.11]What level is the character?
[109:36.41]74?
[109:36.43]75?
[109:41.07]Why are my souls over here?
[109:42.03]Didn't I die, like, way the other way?
[109:49.42]Oh, I forgot to get eye drops.
[110:01.74]There's other items that I gotta get there, too.
[110:07.00]on the cliff.
[110:12.06]Remember, you're stuck in your ways.
[110:14.98]Um, I don't think so.
[110:16.00]I thought he just jumped off the cliff.
[110:26.73]He did.
[110:29.37]Can they not jump off the cliff?
[110:30.67]Will he not fall off?
[110:32.81]They like programmed that in.
[110:33.95]Don't fuck with me.
[110:35.93]I just want the stones.
[110:36.73]He's just right behind me.
[110:50.53]Okay, now we go down to the church because there's definitely something there.
[110:53.19]I'm not fighting this guy.
[111:04.59]Are you actually going to follow me down here?
[111:11.27]What's the Elden Ring?
[111:12.00]Does it let you fly?
[111:12.86]I don't think you can fly when you put on the Elden Ring.
[111:16.44]I'm not even sure what the Elden Ring is.
[111:17.80]The Elden Ring might just be a theory or something.
[111:20.66]Like a myth.
[111:21.12]There probably is no Elden Ring.
[111:32.20]How could something that powerful be able to exist?
[111:36.06]Okay... I believe... So, here we are.
[111:50.26]What is this?
[111:50.62]Do we have a Bobby Hill impression?
[111:56.34]I'll try.
[112:01.03]I can't.
[112:02.37]But I tried.
[112:04.31]Seek three great wise turtles.
[112:07.52]Seek three wise turtles.
[112:09.88]I hate having face cam on.
[112:21.97]Could they be anywhere on the whole island?
[112:24.67]Because if that's the case, then I'm just going to fucking... Does this count?
[112:32.64]No, this is not a magical turtle.
[112:35.66]It can be anywhere on the whole island.
[112:37.78]Are you kidding me?
[112:40.56]They are everywhere.
[112:41.76]They can be anywhere on the whole island.
[112:46.57]Dude, there's not a chance I'm going to do this.
[112:56.99]Three.
[112:57.49]Okay, I need to find three.
[112:59.05]Oh my goodness, I found one.
[113:20.17]What am I supposed to do about it?
[113:20.97]I can't target it.
[113:30.00]I can't target it.
[113:30.58]That's so sad.
[113:37.73]Alright, there's one.
[113:47.40]If they're that big, then they have to be around there, then.
[113:49.74]Alright, I'm just gonna go around the perimeter.
[113:52.74]What a pain in the ass.
[114:01.13]I also need to do this too.
[114:02.51]People are gonna think I'm nuts, but I don't care.
[114:04.49]There was one here.
[114:10.78]I'm gonna just mark where I've been.
[114:34.24]Because I will just walk in circles.
[114:35.72]There's nothing here.
[114:37.08]Alright, where is this on the map?
[114:50.70]Alright, there's nothing here.
[114:53.30]Or there.
[115:05.30]OK.
[115:06.62]Nothing here.
[115:07.10]I don't see anything over all the way over here.
[115:44.40]That's nothing, man.
[115:45.44]You're stressing me out, dude.
[116:08.04]This should be not stressing you out because I'm actually marking where I've actually seen.
[116:24.21]The other tower is down here, so... Why are you assuming that they're all on the edge?
[116:32.68]I don't know, because they're huge?
[116:35.17]And that's really... I can't think of any other place to hide them.
[116:41.14]It's one of these things.
[116:56.09]Okay.
[116:57.05]Okay.
[117:00.65]So, take a look at this.
[117:01.67]I can see this whole line.
[117:03.79]I don't see anything on this edge.
[117:07.35]Nothing here.
[117:10.67]Oh my god, fuck this.
[117:11.62]This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[117:15.04]I'll remove this.
[117:24.86]It's going to be such a pain in the ass to individually remove all these.
[117:28.09]I don't want to remove all markers.
[117:33.09]I have stuff marked that I don't want removed.
[117:39.89]Okay.
[117:40.23]We're going to go over there.
[117:48.08]What?
[117:50.68]This thing is here.
[117:56.56]Let's go!
[118:04.83]What's this?
[118:08.15]It's a boss, right?
[118:10.93]Electo Blackknife Ringleader.
[118:21.80]Holy shit, dude.
[118:26.69]Jesus.
[118:30.17]Okay.
[118:30.67]Well, that was interesting.
[118:38.25]That guy didn't feel like he wanted to stop attacking.
[118:40.67]I feel like this is a backstab encounter.
[118:48.35]Maybe like a backstab.
[118:51.85]18k souls gone.
[118:52.53]They're right here.
[118:55.97]They're right there.
[119:03.80]Alright, this guy's got some moves.
[119:09.86]We'll try some of the intelligence explosions.
[119:15.87]That's pretty good.
[119:16.91]I think I can get a backstab.
[119:26.86]But, holy fucking moly.
[119:34.45]Holy shit!
[119:35.45]Alright, so... When he jumps in the air like that, that's when you go around, that's when you get the backstep.
[119:45.84]You dodge through it.
[119:48.49]And then, wham!
[120:10.31]Oh, dude.
[120:11.53]These are cool.
[120:15.15]This is cool.
[120:15.83]They're just kind of like, oh, hey, look, there's a boss right here.
[120:30.58]What?
[120:31.16]I didn't get it.
[120:31.56]I don't think I was close enough.
[120:37.90]What are you doing?
[120:48.70]Wow, that lasts a long time.
[120:50.18]That lasts a lot longer than I thought it did.
[120:59.06]Oh my goodness.
[121:05.87]Dude, fucking stop swinging at me.
[121:07.83]No, I got it wrong.
[121:39.20]Ah, I went for it.
[121:39.84]Alright, I'll get it down.
[121:53.10]Yeah, you can't... You cannot get the amount of iframes needed to dodge that attack, so you have to run.
[122:14.09]Summon somebody?
[122:15.82]Not until I understand what this guy's all about.
[122:24.98]They don't seem to give you very many opportunities to attack this guy.
[122:30.13]I can't summon.
[122:30.63]So I think this is going to be one of those fights where I just run away.
[122:45.65]Damn.
[122:49.35]Thought I had it.
[123:00.09]Jesus, what the fuck?
[123:04.75]That's huge.
[123:06.27]That's a massive area.
[123:10.65]Okay.
[123:10.91]Yeah, I'm going to try parrying.
[123:17.38]Give me the little parry shield.
[123:30.53]What shield is the best parry?
[123:33.43]I'm not sure it matters.
[123:46.24]Need a buckler.
[123:47.80]Don't go there without touching that.
[123:52.81]I'll try him one or two more times.
[123:53.95]I'll try to parry him.
[123:56.15]He just, he's very elaborate with his moves.
[123:58.91]He does a lot of just regular swings.
[124:01.67]I wonder how effective it'll be.
[124:02.55]Let's find out.
[124:08.72]That was weird.
[124:12.58]Fuck you.
[124:18.54]I didn't have time to do that.
[124:21.00]Jesus, man.
[124:22.16]He's just... There's just almost no opportunity to attack him.
[124:28.87]If I could get the parry, it's just... Whatever.
[124:48.13]I just want to get a successful parry so I can know if I can do it later.
[124:50.75]You should just shoot him?
[124:54.55]Oh, yeah.
[124:54.93]My, like, my... Yeah, Elden Ring added, like, machine guns and, like, handguns.
[125:03.79]Oh, no way.
[125:06.05]Got that wrong.
[125:12.67]His swing timings are so all over the place.
[125:15.98]It's like...
[125:19.85]It's hard to even understand when to do this.
[125:30.05]I could try the guard.
[125:30.94]No, the guard parry would be horrible.
[125:32.56]Because if I did, he'd just attack me and kill me.
[125:43.45]I just want to parry him once.
[125:44.97]And that will be my victory.
[125:46.09]And then I'll leave.
[125:51.08]I just need to parry him one time.
[125:52.40]That's how I win this encounter.
[125:53.90]That's a victory for me.
[125:54.82]I thought he was going to die.
[126:02.22]I thought he was going to dash forward.
[126:04.12]No fucking way, dude.
[126:05.08]This guy's unbearable.
[126:06.86]No way.
[126:13.25]Five more attempts.
[126:13.87]That's it.
[126:24.85]I just want to parry him.
[126:26.59]Five attempts if I parry him.
[126:28.17]That's not what you're betting on, I don't think.
[126:29.43]Just one parry.
[126:44.73]Alright, get over here.
[126:45.33]Looks like I can parry you once.
[126:50.73]That looks pretty good.
[126:53.23]That looks pretty good.
[126:56.60]Didn't it though?
[126:57.12]I don't understand.
[127:03.42]I don't know how you get away from that.
[127:04.84]I really don't get it.
[127:05.76]What do you do?
[127:28.12]I didn't mean to press the button twice.
[127:29.20]I just did.
[127:33.62]Fucking way.
[127:34.30]Okay.
[127:38.12]If you can parry this guy, like, three or four times in a row and, like, not get hit, you're from a different planet.
[127:43.86]You have to be.
[127:45.02]I would actually, like, start to contemplate, like, what potential alien species you could be.
[127:51.37]I'd be like, I have fucking superhuman intelligence.
[127:54.33]I must be from a different planet.
[127:55.23]I have to be.
[128:10.48]Yes, sir.
[128:11.14]What is your reasoning for trying to join the Mensa Academy?
[128:15.38]Uh, the streamer said he was going to meat grind a bunch of people, told me that I had a super genius IQ because I could parry this boss and Elden Wing three times in a row.
[128:25.80]Any mathematics or any English or any medical background?
[128:32.03]No.
[128:32.23]I just got shit-faced one night and was able to parry this guy three times.
[128:36.25]And this streamer told me... Who's this streamer?
[128:38.11]What are you talking about?
[128:56.81]think you can I don't think you can can you bury him like I mean I at some point you just like guess at some point Jesus at some point just guess
[129:18.73]I'm not even trying to fight the boss.
[129:20.81]What's he doing?
[129:22.64]I'm just trying to parry.
[129:23.96]That's the only thing I'm doing and I'm leaving when I get one.
[129:30.36]People come to the stream and they see a guy like, I don't understand what's happening.
[129:34.29]It's like, that's what happens.
[129:35.35]You give your friend the control.
[129:36.29]You're like, hey, play Elden Ring.
[129:37.25]They're going to be like, what do I do, man?
[129:42.61]Where should I go?
[129:43.65]I'm telling you, I'm just practicing parrying.
[130:03.91]This guy's fucking moves are impossible to predict.
[130:08.20]What?
[130:10.68]I mean, honestly though, like holy shit, man.
[130:15.01]It's fucking crazy.
[130:29.76]I'm not leaving until I get a parry once.
[130:33.59]I'm not leaving this area.
[130:36.51]Until I get a... I just want... And then I'm going to alt-f for the game and then come back.
[130:43.09]Try it with one eye.
[130:46.94]It'll be easier.
[130:47.76]Fine.
[131:21.33]I looked like I hit it.
[131:24.42]That second one, I think I hit it.
[131:26.20]I don't think I can parry him.
[131:32.92]He's a smaller shield.
[131:53.32]Okay.
[131:54.10]Last try.
[131:54.96]Last try, that's it, and I'm not coming back.
[131:59.61]Oh.
[132:18.76]Oh, fuck you!
[132:23.50]No, I'm going out- I'm going out on my own terms!
[132:26.06]Hey.
[132:53.05]Wait, where does it say my souls are?
[132:54.51]Wait, why am I all the way over here?
[133:07.62]Oh, I chose the bonfire.
[133:19.15]Fuck.
[133:19.83]Oh well, that's it.
[133:21.77]I'm not going back.
[133:24.12]I'm not going back to that guy ever again.
[133:30.01]Jumping bypass the stake.
[133:31.75]Oh.
[133:32.87]That sucks.
[133:41.89]I still... Just tell me where the turtles are.
[133:43.59]I don't even care.
[133:45.25]I'm not going to sit around for four hours looking around this whole island for the turtles.
[133:48.33]Where are the other two turtles?
[133:49.21]Tell me.
[133:49.87]Just tell me where they are.
[133:51.47]I don't care.
[134:02.20]No, I want four hours of suffering.
[134:05.12]Where are the turtles?
[134:07.12]Where are they?
[134:07.55]Somebody said one of them's flying.
[134:09.25]That would be really funny, but I don't think I believe you.
[134:11.49]What?
[134:15.11]Why are they throwing frisbees at me?
[134:17.11]Stop.
[134:19.53]One is literally flying.
[134:20.99]No, it's not.
[134:28.16]What is this?
[134:32.62]Is that gonna kill me?
[134:34.08]Okay, I was supposed to be so upset.
[134:36.59]What is that one?
[134:37.23]What's that for?
[134:40.37]Wait.
[134:43.32]Could I?
[134:43.90]Where was that?
[134:46.10]Why is it gone?
[135:09.39]Mark that.
[135:11.23]Where is it?
[135:22.90]Fortnite bounce pad, dude.
[135:26.38]I just need to get down there.
[135:27.52]I just need to get down there.
[135:29.52]Get down there.
[135:38.03]I just walked off the edge.
[135:41.54]I just want to go down!
[135:44.10]Thank you.
[135:52.12]Alright.
[135:53.07]Where's the turtle?
[135:53.63]Where is he?
[135:54.55]Tell me now.
[135:54.97]There's a shitload of turtles right here.
[136:11.26]Why are there so many turtles here?
[136:18.54]Seal on the Rise opened.
[136:22.06]What?
[136:25.02]What's the Rise?
[136:35.33]I did it?
[136:40.46]I did it.
[136:40.82]I did?
[136:42.18]Not the three?
[136:51.92]You broke the encounter.
[136:54.14]Wow.
[137:05.48]What did I do?
[137:05.90]No, it was three.
[137:07.86]It was three turtles.
[137:08.70]It said find three wise beasts.
[137:11.42]One big or three small turtles or one big turtle.
[137:16.53]Where was the big turtle?
[137:18.09]Wasn't the big turtle on the cliff?
[137:21.21]I'm very confused how I'm allowed in here right now.
[137:33.09]It was in the air.
[137:34.25]I didn't see it.
[137:38.89]This is kind of a spooky place.
[137:45.63]We're in the sky.
[137:46.45]Oh.
[137:46.77]What's on my head?
[137:49.41]Um... A bug or something.
[138:14.22]I wonder what this was all for.
[138:15.97]It's gonna be for... Something that's gold.
[138:24.37]Manny's Dark Moon.
[138:29.23]What is that?
[138:33.99]68 intelligence.
[138:34.63]I have 45.
[138:41.71]Uses the caster as a... Oh, it's the thing where you go into the moon.
[138:49.40]That caster boss.
[138:58.28]I wonder how good that is.
[139:00.76]Alright.
[139:01.68]I think I've pretty much fully explored this island.
[139:04.64]There's like three dragons here, but I don't care.
[139:07.12]I'm not going to fight them right now.
[139:08.46]Or ever.
[139:09.80]Or ever.
[139:11.62]So, time to make a decision.
[139:15.12]Up from Caelid or kind of up right from the manor, carry manor.
[139:25.13]I have two choices here.
[139:28.76]Up from Caelid or right.
[139:35.70]You know, I actually don't even really care.
[139:39.10]I would do either one of these.
[139:44.22]I'm going to take a quick pee break, and we get a poll in chat.
[139:48.78]Right from Manor, up from Caled.
[139:54.54]Right from Manor, which is this way, or up from Caled.
[140:01.44]Get a poll going.
[140:02.47]I'll take a quick BRB.
[140:03.41]I'm going to pee.
[140:03.81]I'm going to refill my drink, and I'll see you guys in a minute.
[140:06.73]See you in like two minutes.
[142:18.00]you
[144:24.51]Thank you.
[146:28.62]Thanks for watching!
[146:57.51]I got 50 subs an hour ago.
[147:00.39]From Brock Lee, thank you.
[147:03.71]That's a lot.
[147:07.83]I still owe subs.
[147:09.19]Which, maybe I'll try that again.
[147:10.33]I hopefully got that sorted too, but we'll see.
[147:16.67]So where are we going?
[147:20.87]What are the, uh... What was the general consensus?
[147:26.48]63% said up from Kaelin.
[147:28.27]Okay.
[147:35.05]Okay.
[147:37.23]Sounds like a plan.
[147:47.45]27% said, uh, far to do-do.
[147:50.01]That wasn't an option, so sorry.
[148:05.25]the right sound effects on.
[148:06.69]Alright.
[148:09.72]And we go.
[148:10.22]So, up from Kalid.
[148:12.18]That sounds like a plan.
[148:14.10]Very cool.
[148:15.02]Very interested.
[148:21.26]Also, according to the notes, the Dragon Barrel... No, we're already over there.
[148:28.53]That's just... That's not going to happen.
[148:31.11]That's way later.
[148:33.69]Kalid's not Dragon Barrel.
[148:35.90]I really hope this bowling pin isn't going to be your hat always.
[148:39.38]I don't know.
[148:41.24]It's by far the best intelligence hat that I've found so far because specifically, it does not reduce my stamina like the other ones do.
[148:50.04]Alright, let's go.
[148:50.46]I'm just going to go up from here.
[149:02.65]So, this way.
[149:06.57]Which would be actually this way.
[149:11.05]Alright.
[149:15.03]Okay, let's go.
[149:21.32]Swamp of Aonia.
[149:27.98]Can't really... Can I go this way?
[149:30.46]This is rot.
[149:31.02]This is another rot area.
[149:32.22]Okay, it's not...
[149:42.33]Oh, I remember these guys.
[149:43.35]Yeah, I was freaking out about these guys before.
[149:45.57]He's dropping gold.
[150:19.66]Ah, okay.
[150:20.28]Come here.
[150:24.27]Mm-hmm.
[150:36.42]It's like the rabbit from Mario 64.
[150:46.81]What?
[150:47.19]Fuck.
[150:47.61]Oh, scarlet rod.
[150:48.51]Wait.
[150:48.95]Stand over here.
[150:50.21]Where is he?
[150:51.11]What's his pattern?
[151:01.51]Where?
[151:01.87]This pattern is so... Wait.
[151:02.87]Hold on.
[151:12.38]Am I... Am I stupid?
[151:20.27]What?
[151:21.85]Am I stupid?
[151:30.80]I'm going up here.
[151:31.48]That's what I can actually see.
[151:32.68]I mean, obviously, right?
[151:38.99]Like, come on.
[151:45.13]What the fuck happened?
[151:47.11]What?
[151:48.47]Oh, I had the scarlet rod.
[151:51.61]Still locked in.
[152:02.88]Stop by the shack.
[152:08.37]At the southern gate.
[152:16.81]Okay.
[152:25.62]What if I, like, block?
[152:35.53]Where you going?
[152:42.16]Where are you going?
[152:43.02]What?
[152:43.90]You don't go this way anymore?
[153:18.99]Phew!
[153:19.67]What?!
[153:20.89]I don't get it!
[153:38.79]Come here, you little shit!
[154:05.35]Got him!
[154:06.95]Poison armament.
[154:12.28]Uh-oh.
[154:13.68]Fellas.
[154:14.12]Sold out.
[154:18.92]Poison armament.
[154:19.96]Cool.
[154:23.48]Alright, I gotta go up that way, I think, right?
[154:29.46]It's useless.
[154:30.50]Is it?
[154:32.16]It's useless?
[154:32.92]Alright, I'm going kind of the right way, but I almost want to go that way.
[154:38.45]I want to follow the golden thing.
[154:46.11]Celia, Tower of Sorcery.
[154:49.83]What's wrong here?
[154:50.45]I can't go this way.
[154:53.81]I guess not.
[154:54.67]So this is like...
[154:57.59]I guess progression?
[155:00.07]But... I can't go in there.
[155:04.11]Why not?
[155:06.77]Why not?
[155:26.04]Shit!
[155:26.50]I can't go in here.
[155:32.28]Is he firing at me?
[155:33.00]I can go up there.
[155:35.44]Alright, I'm going to do some rooftop jumping here.
[155:46.37]Is that a hole?
[156:19.52]Oh, yes.
[156:20.24]Hi.
[156:21.10]I'm Sigurd.
[156:21.76]It's all up there.
[156:39.03]My god.
[156:39.67]Alright.
[156:40.25]Um... Stop!
[157:01.34]STOP!
[157:02.20]STOP!
[157:02.62]Alright.
[157:08.91]Whee!
[157:39.06]Get the fuck out of here dude.
[157:49.06]Stop!
[157:49.54]I just want to get up here.
[157:50.40]What's in here?
[158:05.15]Another entrance I can't get in.
[158:14.90]You are such a shitty little enemy, too.
[158:16.56]And like, I... Get out of here with this bullshit.
[158:25.83]And you disappeared, too.
[158:37.70]I can get back on the roof.
[158:38.59]I want to go get those items.
[158:39.81]Item Andy.
[158:40.45]Item Andy.
[158:41.03]Item Andy.
[158:41.63]I know.
[159:04.59]Okay, back to the tree.
[159:05.53]Fuck.
[159:21.76]I think I can do it from here.
[159:22.52]If I didn't have somebody up my ass, I would be able to do it.
[159:34.26]If I didn't have somebody constantly up my ass, I'd be able to do it.
[159:46.39]I can't stop!
[159:47.21]Oh my god, if I didn't fall off the fucking roof to begin with.
[159:53.34]If the horse didn't have to make a gigantic 10 meter circle if he wanted to turn around.
[160:13.00]You pain in the ass.
[160:26.55]My god.
[160:27.11]I fucking hate these guys.
[160:31.69]I just want to get on the fucking roof.
[160:33.91]Just get me on the roof.
[160:35.33]I'm just going to go all the way back to where I was before.
[160:37.75]And just get up there.
[160:38.75]I'm getting out of this foggy bullshit, and I'm just going to go from here.
[160:43.65]Oh, my God.
[160:47.98]Fuck all of you.
[160:48.72]Fuck you, dumbass little whatever.
[160:58.12]I can't get up there.
[160:59.18]I'm going to...
[161:13.29]Don't even fucking think about it.
[161:14.33]Don't even think about it.
[161:31.28]Hit him!
[161:32.68]Get off!
[161:33.46]Oh, no, no, no.
[161:34.08]Thank you.
[161:34.54]I appreciate that.
[161:35.10]You actually helped me.
[161:35.70]That actually helped.
[161:36.24]That would have been very mad.
[161:40.32]Okay, there's a ladder right there.
[161:45.14]I don't give a shit about it.
[161:46.12]Never mind.
[161:46.50]Fuck the items.
[161:47.04]Nope.
[161:47.72]How dare you say fuck the items.
[161:49.30]Item ante.
[161:53.96]That guy's going to fuck this whole thing up because he's going to throw a grenade or whatever.
[162:18.10]Ooh, nice.
[162:18.66]Worth it.
[162:21.35]Worth.
[162:22.57]It's worth it.
[162:27.07]Worth it.
[162:33.33]What's this?
[162:35.97]Ooh, light of fire.
[162:37.70]Seal was broken in town.
[162:38.86]Ah.
[162:38.92]So that's how you do it.
[162:45.20]Okay, so there's another one over there.
[162:50.31]So I have to destroy the magical seals.
[162:56.47]I'm so impatient.
[162:57.99]But fuck it, right?
[163:09.70]Okay.
[163:13.53]That's hard to get up to.
[163:31.12]What was that?
[163:41.17]Red.
[163:42.33]Main.
[163:42.93]Painting.
[163:44.99]Oh shit.
[163:45.75]Alright.
[163:46.73]Holy shit.
[163:47.70]What the?
[163:48.30]I would've just won a hundred times.
[163:55.24]It's you.
[163:55.86]Good.
[163:56.24]Now you get to die.
[163:57.10]And you get to die too.
[164:09.65]He's alive?
[164:12.69]Okay.
[164:13.23]Alright.
[164:13.63]Alright.
[164:13.99]Alright.
[164:16.27]Leave.
[164:17.43]Leave.
[164:17.81]Leave.
[164:18.17]Leave.
[164:18.59]Leave.
[164:19.35]Leave.
[164:20.01]Leave.
[164:36.07]I can get that.
[164:37.86]I'm certain of it.
[165:23.62]Hey!
[165:39.32]Well.
[165:39.52]We're going that way.
[165:46.64]He's not enjoying this game at all, you can tell.
[165:49.07]No, actually, that's completely opposite.
[165:57.13]He's not enjoying the game at all.
[165:59.07]Like, he's just desperately trying to fucking hold it together before, like, freaking out on stream one day.
[166:08.93]As you can tell, he's just holding it in.
[166:10.41]He wants to so badly fucking talk about how he hates this.
[166:14.31]He hates what he's doing.
[166:15.83]He hates streaming this game.
[166:17.31]He fucking hates the game.
[166:21.30]Okay.
[166:25.48]It looks like there's a lot of these, so I don't know how many of these I'm supposed to be doing.
[166:32.02]I have two.
[166:48.12]Oh, I got it!
[166:49.42]Double slash!
[166:52.68]Seal's broken up there.
[166:59.18]There's one more that I'm gonna go get.
[167:04.95]Which is over here.
[167:05.55]Then I'm just gonna go in the front door.
[167:12.41]Easy snipe.
[167:13.21]Easy snipe.
[167:14.63]Hell yeah.
[167:17.82]I'm not sure I can get this one from here.
[167:23.84]Hmm.
[167:26.21]Hmm.
[167:27.61]Holy shit.
[167:28.63]That's a face.
[167:30.97]Holy crap.
[167:35.53]Um.
[167:36.55]Well.
[167:36.75]A little awkward.
[167:46.82]A little awkward, but whatever.
[167:47.88]I'm just gonna go in the front door.
[167:56.05]Holy crap, dude.
[167:57.41]Yeah, holy crap.
[168:00.41]Would you guys rather I say, holy crap, or say, like, fuck?
[168:06.11]Which one's, like, you think more appropriate?
[168:07.38]I'm just gonna go in the front door.
[168:17.04]I don't want to just be like a swear guy, you know what I mean?
[168:19.14]I'm gonna start saying like... Holy shoot.
[168:23.30]Oh my god.
[168:24.61]Oh my goodness.
[168:25.31]Holy- What the- Oh crap.
[168:31.65]Um, there's a chest just sitting here.
[168:38.50]Night Comet?!
[168:40.18]Holy crap!
[168:43.69]That was a genuine holy crap.
[168:45.91]That one was genuine, I can promise you.
[168:49.19]That was a genuine holy crap.
[168:57.40]Holy crap, a night comet?
[168:59.18]Alright, well let's do this.
[169:03.68]I got this one open.
[169:06.48]I got another one open too.
[169:07.40]Should I do the one that's lower?
[169:08.89]This one downtown.
[169:10.53]Why am I saying downtown?
[169:11.49]You know what I mean?
[169:16.42]I do need a map fragment, which is here.
[169:22.40]Why is it pointing that way?
[169:28.31]Excuse me?
[169:32.03]Go up this way and now go that way.
[169:37.19]What are you talking about?
[169:45.94]Please do your best Australian accent.
[169:47.98]Ah, no.
[169:49.98]No.
[169:51.62]I'm not gonna do... No.
[169:54.24]No!
[169:55.48]No!
[170:18.86]It's so funny Accents like people just get so rage filled if like someone's doing an accent and they don't sound like their neighbor.
[170:28.49]You know what I mean?
[170:28.99]Wait Is he doing an Australian accent?
[170:37.18]Oh, he doesn't sound like my fucking neighbor mate.
[170:39.82]Get him!
[170:40.76]But it's just an accent.
[170:42.58]It's just an accent.
[170:43.70]It's just an impression.
[170:56.59]You guys got a lot of health.
[170:57.47]Oh fuck.
[170:58.25]Okay, pay attention.
[171:09.21]Oh, I'm getting double attacked.
[171:23.72]Don't let him put himself back together.
[171:25.52]Did you do Jack Sparrow?
[171:44.27]My career is over.
[171:45.13]I'm ending my career.
[171:46.26]It's over today.
[172:07.26]Listen, I have two headphones in it.
[172:09.48]Let me explain.
[172:11.51]The reason why I never have two headphones in is because I can't hear myself talk.
[172:15.93]When there are two headphones in, I can't hear myself speak, and it kind of speech jams me and messes up pretty much everything.
[172:23.60]So, I don't know how I sounded right there, but I know it sounded... I imagine a walrus with like a big mustache that goes like this.
[172:34.10]Like when he's talking?
[172:34.95]Does that make sense?
[172:38.19]That's like all I heard, and that's all I saw.
[172:42.66]Where'd he go?
[172:44.70]Okay.
[172:47.18]Ooh.
[172:50.45]I can get on top of the building.
[172:52.21]Okay.
[173:12.47]No, Your Grace.
[173:13.49]From the last Grace.
[173:17.78]God, he sucks.
[173:18.46]I... She's quiet.
[173:23.58]He sucks.
[173:24.24]I'm like... I'm trying to jump across the building.
[173:26.58]No, I actually... I don't suck.
[173:31.30]Excuse you.
[174:02.76]Okay, you can't make that jump.
[174:03.94]It looks like you can.
[174:05.22]It actually looks like you can make the jump.
[174:09.66]What the fuck?
[174:10.34]I didn't want to go to the statue.
[174:11.94]There's probably another way around.
[174:25.07]I thought it was possible to make the jump if you did it like perfectly or something.
[174:31.66]There's another way to get up there.
[174:33.70]Which is probably... I actually don't know.
[174:39.23]Can't go from here.
[174:40.09]Maybe I can.
[174:41.65]Okay, whatever.
[174:46.75]Alright, let's keep going.
[174:59.54]So...
[175:02.95]I need to go... Where do I go from here?
[175:09.06]That way?
[175:11.80]This way, up around?
[175:17.26]Alright.
[175:19.19]Let's continue our trek through Elden Ring.
[175:26.07]Items though, hold on.
[175:30.79]Maybe, probably that way, but let's just go.
[175:37.59]He keeps dying in such comically avoidable ways.
[175:40.30]Well, but I mean, if you're... Okay.
[175:42.06]But I'm exploring.
[175:43.24]I am exploring the game.
[175:48.63]So of course I'm going to fall down somewhere if I've ever been there and I'm going to try to jump up there or something.
[175:53.84]Like what?
[175:54.44]I'm a huge Breath of the Wild fan.
[175:57.20]One of the cool things about Breath of the Wild was you could actually go wherever you wanted.
[176:02.00]It wasn't like, oh, you have to go here, you have to go there.
[176:04.30]That's why this game, I'm comparing it to BOTW.
[176:08.52]But you can just kind of explore.
[176:11.76]And that's what I like about this game.
[176:12.84]So that's how I'm going to play it.
[176:43.02]Okay, what?
[176:45.99]That was very odd.
[176:47.19]Is it still there?
[176:49.43]Why do I feel like it's still up there?
[176:56.93]Don't you feel like it's still up there and it's going to reappear?
[176:58.91]Okay.
[177:13.41]El Balo.
[177:31.07]I can't wait till it's actually a boss.
[177:34.46]If El Balo is really a boss.
[177:37.88]With a health bar.
[177:39.95]And it plays like that.
[177:41.93]El Balo.
[177:59.36]Will you officiate?
[178:01.55]I'm not officiating any weddings.
[178:04.91]Is it?
[178:07.48]Oh, yes.
[178:09.40]One sec.
[178:10.45]Oh, my God.
[178:12.61]One second.
[178:21.87]Oh, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.
[178:30.10]There's a person here.
[178:30.82]Okay, hold on.
[178:31.34]Let me look.
[178:34.18]Let me see.
[178:34.58]What have we got?
[178:35.08]What have we got?
[178:35.54]What have we got?
[178:35.96]What have we got?
[178:39.07]Hey, hey, I'm trying to, hold on, I'm looking at, like, what's, I'm looking at food.
[178:48.71]Stop!
[178:49.09]No, I have to just touch that thing.
[179:03.45]Okay, alright.
[179:05.36]Oh, the old girlfriend wants to ask what you want for food to get you killed in Elden Ring.
[179:11.88]Honey, it didn't work.
[179:17.55]Alright, hold on.
[179:18.23]Give me one second.
[179:18.81]I want to actually look at this.
[179:48.73]Okay, of course.
[179:49.33]Of course, my usual order.
[179:54.19]Usual order.
[179:55.12]Five McChickens.
[179:57.46]Extra blue cheese.
[180:04.82]Alright, there's somebody here.
[180:14.18]He's pretending he has a girlfriend.
[180:37.58]Hold on, guys.
[180:38.38]I gotta check in with the girlfriend.
[180:41.22]It's just I'm making it up.
[180:43.06]What if I'm just making that up?
[180:46.32]That's so fucking... That'd be weird.
[180:51.61]Okay, so this person... Is there like a cure I can give this person?
[181:02.97]Ooh, what's this?
[181:22.25]Well, there's nothing else here.
[181:26.04]Is the mic audio fucked up today?
[181:27.68]It shouldn't be.
[181:28.30]I don't know.
[181:29.54]I don't think so.
[181:34.72]Alright, that's good.
[181:36.28]Did I actually get enough to do this?
[181:37.26]Four golden seeds.
[181:40.14]Damn it.
[181:40.38]Okay, so you're infected with scarlet rot.
[181:47.60]I've actually made my way to a road, which is pretty pog.
[181:52.12]Pog.
[181:53.96]Oh, spells, right.
[181:56.62]What did I got?
[182:06.29]Oh, no, no, no.
[182:07.41]I need 68 intelligence to use it.
[182:16.35]How close am I to actual 52, though?
[182:21.91]What would I rank Elden Ring?
[182:23.23]You mean like on the... What are we going to call these now?
[182:27.39]Right?
[182:28.19]Before it was like Dark Souls, Souls-like, or Souls game.
[182:32.03]Then Bloodborne came out, and it became a Souls-borne game.
[182:36.96]Sekiro came out, which wasn't really a kind of Souls kind of game.
[182:42.20]It was close.
[182:43.40]But this one is.
[182:46.17]Are we going to call these, like, Soulsbrings?
[182:49.63]Souls... Soulsbrings?
[182:53.50]Alright, what do I rank this in the Soulsbring franchises?
[182:57.60]Soldenbring.
[183:02.16]Solden... Soldenbringborn.
[183:05.35]Soldenbron.
[183:06.29]Soldenbringer.
[183:07.41]Ringborner.
[183:08.97]Soldenbring.
[183:14.35]Soulbringborn.
[183:23.62]Okay, Soulbringborn is good.
[183:28.38]I don't know.
[183:28.82]Probably like one or two.
[183:31.57]I want to pass the time because I'm curious if she dies.
[183:40.51]Still alright?
[183:46.52]Well, you seem to be perfectly fine from this morning.
[183:49.20]You need to go to the shack.
[183:58.90]Oh, alright.
[183:59.30]Well, I don't know where the shack is.
[184:00.84]Is it on the map?
[184:08.25]Find the shack.
[184:11.98]Oh, that's a grave.
[184:12.82]What's that?
[184:13.36]Is that a shack?
[184:27.22]Don't fucking die, please.
[184:28.22]Nope.
[184:34.35]Not fighting you.
[184:35.03]I think there's an NPC here.
[184:46.64]South of the town.
[185:00.19]You're screaming because you're gonna get hit by that.
[185:03.31]That's like what I do.
[185:16.09]Okay, so there's an NPC here.
[185:18.39]That's not an NPC, whatever.
[185:23.70]What do you got?
[185:41.68]There's something weird over there though.
[185:42.88]What's that?
[185:54.65]Drawstring Poison Grease?
[185:59.74]Whatever.
[186:12.32]That was a fully charged R2.
[186:13.52]Feels good when you hit that shit.
[186:28.22]What is... Oh, that's... Ah, okay.
[186:32.56]That's where the festival was, and then we fought down there.
[186:35.98]Okay, I get it.
[186:36.57]This game's fucking... Never mind, I don't want to be an idiot.
[186:44.09]I don't know what's going on here, but there's butterflies.
[186:48.53]Your thinking face looks dumb.
[186:54.01]Let's see your thinking face, man.
[186:57.01]I don't know why that got me.
[186:59.22]That got me.
[187:00.90]I don't know why that got me.
[187:03.32]That got me angry.
[187:05.25]I don't understand why, but it did and it tilted me to a point where I got killed in the middle of that.
[187:10.29]Those guys die in one hit.
[187:30.05]I don't know what's safe and what's not safe to fall.
[187:31.90]Alright, let's go.
[187:34.28]There's a clown on the top right of your screen.
[188:00.08]Where?
[188:00.28]Where?
[188:00.48]Where?
[188:00.68]Where?
[188:00.86]Where do we go?
[188:01.38]Where do we go?
[188:08.00]Big guy.
[188:09.57]Oh, big guy.
[188:41.15]No problem.
[188:44.77]Hot.
[188:48.12]Why is nobody spamming that?
[188:49.92]You guys get over that in one day?
[188:57.82]You guys got over that in literally 24 hours.
[189:02.83]Omega Law, what an old meme that is.
[189:04.55]That was yesterday.
[189:05.85]I don't think so.
[189:20.29]This is bringing me just back to where all the dog man farming fighting is.
[189:34.73]Okay, that looks like a shack.
[189:39.11]What else looks like a shack here?
[189:40.48]This could be a shack.
[189:44.64]I mean, maybe one of these.
[189:46.38]Something over here could maybe be a shack.
[189:51.04]Something right here could be a shack.
[189:56.38]I don't see anything here that's shack-like.
[190:06.41]It's a shack like over here.
[190:09.47]Oh my goodness.
[190:10.21]We're fine.
[190:12.73]Alright, so you mean like right here?
[190:14.17]Like over this way?
[190:14.75]That looks like a shack right there.
[190:16.59]I think that's a shack.
[190:19.33]I think we found the shack.
[190:22.40]I think we found it.
[190:25.08]I did everything.
[190:25.76]You didn't do anything.
[190:27.56]I found it.
[190:29.04]Not we.
[190:29.38]Me.
[190:29.52]I did everything.
[190:45.50]There are two of you?
[190:48.90]That's weird.
[190:53.62]Oh, you're invisible.
[190:55.08]Oats.
[191:05.54]I can definitely level up again.
[191:07.18]Ooh.
[191:09.11]You know what this reminds me of?
[191:12.73]This reminds me of Neverhood.
[191:16.43]Stuff like that.
[191:17.75]Those big bulb, almost like clay-like trees.
[191:24.90]Okay, so I gotta go up here and apparently the shack is right there.
[191:34.43]I mean this looks like a shack.
[191:35.25]It might not be.
[191:44.05]I thought it looked like it could be an NPC.
[191:49.51]It was not an NPC.
[191:54.47]I have no mana.
[192:00.01]We don't need it.
[192:09.97]Swamp Lookout Tower.
[192:17.90]Eternal Darkness.
[192:23.90]Oh, that's right.
[192:24.38]I did get the... I got the Night Comet.
[192:28.56]And the... Okay, cool.
[192:31.43]What does Eternal Darkness do?
[192:38.75]Can I do anything else with this?
[192:40.09]Probably not.
[192:41.19]Maybe I can.
[192:41.71]Hold on.
[192:44.04]This might be kind of a weird thing to try, but whatever.
[192:49.78]Like... It looks like I can get in there.
[192:55.07]Yeah, look.
[192:55.61]See?
[192:57.07]On the tree?
[192:57.45]Can I climb the tree?
[193:00.35]And jump from the top?
[193:04.01]Or does it just look cool?
[193:10.98]Alright.
[193:12.00]That's not the shack.
[193:15.00]It's a cool tower.
[193:24.73]This... Okay, this is a good vantage point.
[193:30.91]That a shack?
[193:43.48]Right there?
[193:43.88]That could look like a shack.
[193:50.64]Just south of town, it's in the canyon.
[193:53.48]Like here?
[193:54.02]Shack?
[194:13.73]Jack, probably down here.
[194:16.72]Alright, Jack.
[194:51.37]Stop by the shack.
[194:54.63]Is it even on the map?
[194:55.63]It's not.
[194:56.34]I mean it kind of is.
[194:57.26]It sort of blends in.
[194:59.44]Wait.
[195:00.46]How am I supposed to stop by the shack?
[195:01.40]You have a big dog.
[195:15.12]Okay.
[195:24.81]Back time.
[195:32.05]What do you got?
[195:32.63]What's here?
[195:39.81]Secret.
[196:12.35]What do you got?
[196:12.85]I know where she is.
[196:13.53]Maleficent?
[196:14.09]No way.
[196:14.41]Okay, what about her?
[196:35.37]I have these like pink boogers.
[196:53.12]Deep Scarlet Swamp?
[196:53.66]Don't I have it?
[196:54.44]I actually think I have it.
[197:20.44]Bro.
[197:22.38]Bro, I already own it.
[197:25.04]Here it is.
[197:26.52]Gold needle.
[197:27.14]Okay.
[197:28.66]That's not the right one.
[197:30.16]So it's in the deep swamp.
[197:43.50]Swamp of... ...somewhere.
[197:47.16]Deep in the swampy area.
[197:48.70]Okay, cool.
[197:50.26]Let's keep going.
[198:01.87]Um... I think I'm gonna just port back here.
[198:04.17]And just go up.
[198:10.57]Add that to the notes.
[198:13.02]Yeah, deep in the, what was it called?
[198:32.87]What did he say?
[198:33.29]He said a bunch of words.
[198:34.66]Deep in the swamp of the scarlet, swamp of the, whatever he said.
[198:38.06]We all know, we get it.
[198:52.09]Just rub these pink and purple boogers all over you and you'll feel fine.
[199:01.52]I think I even have one.
[199:11.61]I will go into the mouth.
[199:19.45]Crazy.
[199:21.61]These guys don't care.
[199:24.39]Crazy looking.
[199:31.97]That looks cool from far away.
[199:40.10]Almost.
[199:42.24]That was close if I had spent even one more second caring about that view.
[199:47.84]Nice try, though.
[199:49.84]Very nice try.
[199:50.73]Alright, I definitely can get to there from here, can't I?
[199:55.47]Did another one just drop and I missed it?
[200:05.26]That's where I came from.
[200:06.40]Is there a way to keep going up?
[200:09.08]I guess I have to go that way.
[200:15.47]Who's rolling the balls?
[200:16.43]I don't know.
[200:16.89]It's a magical ball roller.
[200:22.20]This road... There's no more road here.
[200:25.88]Ooh, there's a jumpy.
[200:28.95]Try going this way.
[200:45.13]Can I go up?
[200:54.75]I'll go that way.
[200:57.49]This place is cool.
[200:58.09]I like this place.
[201:00.85]More starlight shards, but what am I even going to use these for?
[201:03.30]I didn't even look what they did.
[201:05.50]The game really wants me to do like a funny little go down here thing.
[201:11.32]Look at these platforms.
[201:15.18]Or is it just one platform and my brain is stupid?
[201:17.58]I think that's what it is.
[201:18.36]No.
[201:20.48]Why is this here?
[201:23.26]You see what I mean?
[201:23.70]Like, what's the point of these?
[201:24.42]Guide and gatekeeper for those returning to the roots.
[201:46.14]What do I just do?
[201:51.18]Gamer statue.
[201:54.30]What do these do?
[201:55.08]What is that?
[201:56.88]Showing you where it points to a dungeon.
[201:58.84]Uh-huh.
[201:59.44]Okay, okay, okay.
[202:01.38]The dungeon down there?
[202:02.58]Okay.
[202:11.79]Oh, god damn it.
[202:12.69]Okay, so this is what you want me to do?
[202:23.64]No.
[202:26.45]No, I don't know.
[202:26.91]I'm gonna keep going.
[202:34.63]Shit.
[202:37.28]Hmm.
[202:41.90]I gotta go up.
[202:47.82]Fall, fall, fall.
[202:48.83]I'm not gonna fall.
[202:50.99]I'm not fighting any of these guys for no reason.
[202:57.01]Okay, cool.
[202:58.61]Back over here.
[203:06.99]Just seeing if there's anything interesting.
[203:08.71]There is not.
[203:09.35]Beast blood?
[203:17.89]Wait, don't I know this guy?
[203:26.39]Isn't that the guy that was at the festival?
[203:30.13]Oh, we'll never know because I fucking killed him.
[203:42.04]That... I guess I'm gonna use it.
[203:53.42]Definitely go on top of the head.
[203:54.38]There's no way there's not something cool up here.
[203:58.09]Yep.
[204:00.33]Of course there is.
[204:03.07]Smithing stones.
[204:06.63]Multiple smithing stones.
[204:10.40]Nice.
[204:12.40]That's a lot of smithing stones up here.
[204:14.34]Oh, fuck.
[204:19.51]Is that alive?
[204:22.59]What's that?
[204:27.03]What's that?
[204:28.63]What's that?
[204:30.53]Alright, let's do it.
[204:31.51]I'm very intrigued.
[204:32.25]Is it alive?
[204:51.26]What's happening?
[204:51.76]What's going on?
[204:52.24]Is this thing alive?
[204:54.70]It is.
[204:56.48]It's hurt though.
[205:24.77]I thought it was a statue.
[205:26.03]It's alive?
[205:29.03]That is crazy.
[206:06.48]35,000 3,500 souls alright that what I need to go examine that thing that's crazy There's so many dragons everywhere I
[206:24.11]Can I ride him?
[206:25.01]Can I get on his back?
[206:26.99]Alright.
[206:27.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[206:28.57]I gotta get... We're going to get the map fragment.
[206:31.47]I'm not going to do that right now.
[206:33.29]Map fragment.
[206:34.43]Very important.
[206:35.54]I'm not going to fight ten dragons at the same time.
[206:38.74]And the omega dragon.
[206:39.84]That's not happening.
[206:59.48]Don't fight me.
[207:07.48]Neat.
[207:11.29]Alright.
[207:11.61]Map, Fragment, and maybe a Bonfire?
[207:15.65]This is Dragon Barrow!
[207:21.09]This is Dragon Barrow.
[207:22.13]This is where the other half of the Medallion is.
[207:27.08]Alright.
[207:28.04]I need a... ...funk bar now.
[207:30.12]I don't see one.
[207:44.79]I'm gonna head this way.
[207:51.28]That's grass.
[208:01.04]There we go.
[208:01.80]Alright.
[208:03.56]We can also level up probably once or twice.
[208:05.10]Perfect.
[208:07.30]So, we're... Dragon Barrow, far to the east of the other half of that Resident Evil coin thing.
[208:15.64]Well, it was called... It was a fort.
[208:19.89]It's like, oh, Seek Fort something, right?
[208:25.97]Fort... Fort... Fort Faroth.
[208:28.17]Fort Faroth, yeah.
[208:30.48]Alright, that's where we're going.
[208:31.48]I'm going to find that fort.
[208:37.44]I think I can level up twice because this might be 10,000.
[208:50.58]We'll find out.
[208:59.65]Okay, I might be a little short.
[209:06.30]Yeah, I'm a little short.
[209:10.55]Okay.
[209:20.16]Although...
[209:28.23]Let me... Okay, that's definitely not a fort.
[209:32.51]This could be.
[209:36.67]That could be... Okay, let me clear all the shit I have out.
[209:42.02]This could be a fort.
[209:44.62]This... I don't think that's a fort.
[209:50.68]This looks like it.
[209:52.30]That's probably it right there.
[209:55.51]I'm going to guess it's one of those two.
[209:57.81]I'm also going to mark this because I want to go to it.
[209:59.29]Yeah, it's definitely two.
[210:02.77]There's no way it's not two.
[210:03.99]But I'm closer to four.
[210:05.07]Let's just mark all this stuff because I'm going to be experimenting.
[210:10.35]Four is closer.
[210:13.35]So that's where I'm going to go.
[210:15.57]Just to see what it is.
[210:24.24]Be careful.
[210:25.15]There are dogs among us.
[210:35.19]Take a little shot.
[210:35.91]Wait.
[210:36.87]Why is it... Why are you fighting me?
[210:39.22]What?
[210:39.48]I didn't do... Why are they attacking me?
[210:41.56]Why are the goats attacking?
[210:48.36]Get away from me.
[210:49.20]I don't want to kill these goats.
[210:53.56]No animal in the whole game is attacked besides these guys.
[210:55.88]There's another bonfire.
[211:10.10]Oh, merchant.
[211:11.62]Merchant shack.
[211:14.69]Maybe I'll buy something.
[211:16.83]Well...
[211:18.87]There's been an age since I've seen a customer.
[211:22.15]How can I help here at the end of the Earth?
[211:28.51]Dragon wound grease.
[211:30.81]Travel stone.
[211:35.67]Jewel pot.
[211:37.75]Spiked.
[211:38.97]Cestus.
[211:43.25]Ooh.
[211:46.94]Note gateway.
[211:48.38]Note imparting knowledge in brief.
[211:50.88]Hidden cave.
[211:55.46]Let's get these.
[211:56.50]I'm going to read them right now.
[212:05.01]I'm going to mark this.
[212:14.15]And I'm going to read those notes.
[212:21.19]Where are they listed here, right?
[212:23.41]Okay, note.
[212:23.99]Gateway.
[212:26.35]Fort Gale in Caled houses a gateway that leads to Red Main Castle.
[212:34.00]Okay.
[212:36.04]There is a hidden cave in the town of Celia.
[212:38.29]Look beyond the graveyard at the precipice.
[212:40.31]Okay.
[212:42.23]Okay.
[212:44.67]This painter is said to have captured the landscape seen during the last moments of those welcomed into Death's Embrace.
[212:50.83]The soul of the painter and vestiges of the dead's last moments can be discovered by visiting the location depicted even now.
[212:57.20]These are cool because you have to go find this spot and find this exact place.
[213:09.67]Find that exact view and it's probably like look down and hit A.
[213:15.17]I think that's close.
[213:20.79]That seems close.
[213:21.99]I'll look at it later.
[213:28.58]Didn't Breath of the Wild do this?
[213:30.54]Yeah, I know.
[213:31.24]B-O-T-W.
[213:32.30]B-O-T-W is one of the best games.
[213:38.47]Alright, so that's that.
[213:40.05]Let's go... I'm gonna go...
[213:46.05]Probably not.
[213:47.31]Let's go.
[213:48.26]Whatever.
[213:49.12]This is lazy, but I don't care.
[213:58.19]Any chapstick?
[213:58.93]Thank you for reminding me.
[213:59.77]Appreciate that.
[214:16.52]Ow.
[214:16.68]Alright, so now I'm going to go this way.
[214:20.89]We're just knocking out all the markers just because I feel like it.
[214:23.01]That's what we're doing.
[214:23.69]That's where we're going.
[214:43.06]Really?
[214:48.83]You got a lot of health.
[214:49.83]So what's this thing?
[215:02.85]Alright, be careful.
[215:11.84]He's so scary.
[215:29.91]Go all the way up.
[215:36.03]Divine Tower.
[215:36.73]There's epic lootations in there, and it activates a great rune.
[215:41.10]Ooh, that's cool.
[215:42.94]What he's saying is, let's go.
[215:43.98]Get up there.
[215:51.94]Why does this seem like the worst and best?
[215:54.74]Okay, you're supposed to do this.
[215:56.12]Holy shit.
[215:57.48]Okay, I just like Dark Souls.
[215:59.24]I pressed the sprint button.
[216:21.41]Geez, this is so fucking stressful, okay.
[216:23.88]He's gonna get in the way, so get rid of it.
[216:42.27]Happy birthday, what?
[216:45.69]Happy 4000th birthday.
[216:52.22]Where's Lanya?
[216:53.58]I've been looking for them the whole game.
[217:01.25]Right.
[217:05.23]That is a... One of these.
[217:08.93]Divine Tower of Caelid.
[217:15.80]Very, very, very, very nice.
[217:24.47]What's in the tower is the question.
[217:44.34]Oh, there's a door here.
[217:46.16]Oops.
[217:59.89]Yeah, this is going to... Yeah, that's right.
[218:01.27]It activates the gray rock.
[218:16.78]That's intriguing.
[218:17.60]That's intriguing.
[218:18.46]That's intriguing.
[218:19.28]That's intriguing!
[218:25.18]See it?
[218:30.17]You see it?
[218:43.10]I can jump halfway into the thing.
[218:50.39]How much longer till you finish the game?
[218:51.65]A very, very long way.
[218:54.59]An exceptionally long way.
[219:03.03]Restore the power of Great Ruin.
[219:07.35]Dianne's Great Ruin.
[219:11.53]What does that one do?
[219:19.08]Raises maximum HP, FP, and stamina.
[219:29.00]Um, okay, so this one is... Okay.
[219:32.84]Godrick's gives you plus 5 to all stats.
[219:38.27]Verdansk gives you increased HP, FP, and stamina.
[219:43.37]But... It's 5 vitality better than the max HP you get from this.
[219:48.36]You know what I mean?
[219:49.36]I feel like you get more from this, unless this is a lot.
[219:58.02]Because this is effectively vigor, mind, and endurance.
[220:04.10]Whereas this is all of them.
[220:07.16]I wonder how much it actually is.
[220:09.46]To me, that would have to be very significant to not use the other one.
[220:17.82]That's cool.
[220:18.32]Alright.
[220:20.16]So, the fort is definitely right there.
[220:24.34]Very cool.
[220:31.23]HP's probably higher.
[220:34.17]Dan is only good once you've hit the soft cap of stats.
[220:38.17]Oh, that makes sense.
[220:40.64]If you get to 40 vitality, right?
[220:42.90]40 vigor.
[220:44.38]That makes sense.
[220:46.02]That would be better then.
[220:47.16]Not that useful.
[220:49.20]Maybe not.
[220:53.45]What about the rest of the tower?
[220:55.91]Oh, there was another way to go.
[220:57.11]You're right.
[220:57.73]I even freaked out about it.
[220:59.39]Let me do this part.
[221:00.03]I'm going to do this first.
[221:05.85]This is... got me.
[221:07.45]This has got me hooked.
[221:08.55]This part here.
[221:09.83]There's also the huge dragon here, too.
[221:11.51]Alright, I'm gonna go kill the huge dragon.
[221:19.77]I'm gonna go... stab the dragon in the face.
[221:22.86]I wonder how much damage it does.
[221:25.82]Is this, like, just Garrett?
[221:26.52]Am I gonna die here?
[221:32.28]He summons a shitload of dragons.
[221:33.50]I'm just gonna die.
[221:43.14]Can I sneak up?
[221:48.42]Wow.
[221:50.64]Get in the face?
[221:51.95]Jump on top?
[221:53.99]I don't know what to do.
[221:56.85]Can I actually climb on top?
[222:02.64]Oh, that was another dragon.
[222:36.06]Why are they just letting me?
[222:37.40]I'm stuck here.
[222:39.36]I think I got the strat.
[222:41.64]Get away from me.
[222:45.20]Don't move.
[222:51.04]I just did 13,000 damage?
[222:55.80]How?
[222:55.98]Lead.
[223:33.85]So... I mean, I had kind of a cheese ball strat right there.
[223:38.09]But... I wonder if it's...
[223:44.57]Maybe I should try... How big is he?
[223:46.45]Ooh, there's a Gravestone.
[224:12.73]Alright, maybe I should go along his body.
[224:16.80]He probably, I guarantee you, they probably got like a big bulbous pimple on their back that I can just whack.
[224:25.02]Right?
[224:26.57]It's probably a huge pimple.
[224:33.99]Let's go find out.
[224:44.49]Where's his body?
[224:52.86]Why is he just... Why is he all head and neck?
[224:57.12]This is a huge neck with wings.
[225:04.33]Where is his body?
[225:17.35]Gonna go further up the mountain.
[225:37.68]He's all head and neck.
[225:39.44]His legs are gonna be this big and he's gonna have like tiny little feet.
[225:52.49]Okay.
[225:55.45]Okay.
[225:55.87]There's his head.
[225:57.85]Lying down.
[226:00.39]Theoretically, his tail should be this way.
[226:06.08]Where are my souls?
[226:10.76]Okay.
[226:11.30]I need my souls.
[226:12.84]You're just sitting on top of him.
[226:14.24]That's so dumb.
[226:15.64]Whatever.
[226:16.70]Okay.
[226:36.10]Okay.
[226:46.07]I don't like doing this I feel bad This actually makes me sad This makes me sad
[227:15.27]That's a lot of ruins.
[227:36.89]Stop it.
[227:38.49]I love how in the middle of stop it, stop it.
[227:40.33]Dude, what the fuck?
[227:41.17]Come on, stop.
[227:42.41]Literally ruining the game is come to Brazil.
[227:56.23]I'm not gonna stop.
[227:59.67]I... This is actually stupid.
[228:02.11]Should I not be doing this for like storyline reasons?
[228:08.83]Is there actually a reason why I shouldn't be doing this?
[228:19.04]It's a story NPC.
[228:23.42]14,000 damage on a bleed.
[228:52.53]My guys like alright Okay, my god.
[228:56.66]I feel like I've been chopping wood all day Use the rune boost.
[229:01.25]You're right.
[229:01.89]Holy shit.
[229:02.33]It's gonna be so much more How about both item discovery and rune boost?
[229:40.95]He's dying!
[230:06.78]I feel like bad.
[230:07.70]That was so sad.
[230:10.16]64,000 souls?
[230:15.76]A new power is available though.
[230:17.20]Alright.
[230:24.19]I'm sorry.
[230:24.63]I wouldn't be able to do this.
[230:25.39]It would smell like rotten eggs right here.
[230:27.81]It would smell like just rotting eggs.
[230:30.39]This thing was lying down for probably like a century.
[230:33.75]This would kill you.
[230:35.21]The power of the smell right here would kill you.
[230:40.32]Alright.
[230:40.88]Turn around.
[230:42.44]Right there.
[230:43.02]Unless... Was he... Lying on top of something, right?
[230:58.69]Item or something?
[231:03.32]Doesn't look like it.
[231:03.98]I was seeing if there's an item here.
[231:08.24]New power is available, though.
[231:09.44]I wonder what that is.
[231:13.13]And here's the fort.
[231:19.81]Alright, now we're going to be able to combine that coin once I get it, whatever's here.
[231:26.36]Hurry up and go kill stuff with that buff activated.
[231:28.22]You know what?
[231:29.04]You're absolutely right.
[231:31.20]But... Yeah, you're right.
[231:33.38]You're absolutely right.
[231:34.06]Let's go.
[231:35.38]Hold still a minute.
[231:44.57]Port Harov.
[231:47.65]Yeah, absolutely.
[231:52.81]Kill stuff.
[231:53.23]Hurry up.
[232:06.22]This whole room is filled with fucking dirt.
[232:08.82]What is going on?
[232:15.55]That's a beefy guy.
[232:28.60]I'm not going to lose the souls.
[232:50.35]They're right here.
[232:55.36]all the minus 120k omega LOL it's not they're right here
[233:23.33]I believe we're at 48.
[233:25.39]I need a little bit more.
[233:39.42]How much more do I need?
[233:43.50]52 gets me the new staff.
[233:48.64]Oh, I can.
[233:49.14]What am I, stupid?
[233:55.49]Alright.
[233:57.27]I'm going to get... Let's go.
[233:58.55]Here we do it.
[234:00.15]I'm also going to do this because why not?
[234:02.27]No reason not to.
[234:06.95]So I can just see what's going on in this freaking room.
[234:09.84]Okay.
[234:26.66]I'm dirt in my eyes.
[234:28.32]God, motherfucker.
[234:32.17]Alright, you... How come I can't... There's no critical there.
[234:37.87]I feel like there should be.
[234:53.18]There's no crit!
[235:00.83]He's gonna grab!
[235:15.49]Fucking soap.
[235:29.48]Soap.
[235:30.31]I think the soap is bait.
[235:31.23]I don't think it actually does anything.
[235:32.93]Oh, look.
[235:33.45]There'll be an enemy in the game that eats the soap.
[235:36.11]There'll be a random person that eats the soap.
[235:39.62]And, oh, bring me soaps.
[235:40.84]Bring me 50 soaps.
[235:43.66]That's the only reason why it exists.
[235:58.06]Aimer doesn't know what to do with soap.
[236:10.49]Why is there a drop down here?
[236:11.41]Oh, here we go.
[236:17.29]It's going to be the coin.
[236:20.91]Ectus Medallion, right.
[236:23.73]And now that I have them both, what do I do with it?
[236:27.64]What do I do with it?
[236:32.08]I wonder.
[236:32.44]Oops.
[236:37.25]Oh, well, there might be something over there.
[236:38.61]Did we craft them together?
[236:48.28]Yeah.
[236:49.34]Um...
[237:07.17]Left half is said to reside... Yeah.
[237:10.57]Right half of a split medallion.
[237:13.09]Left half of a split medallion.
[237:14.45]Do we have to bring it to somebody?
[237:19.05]Yep.
[237:23.21]Okay.
[237:27.37]Okay.
[237:38.95]Maybe the blacksmith?
[237:40.87]That's what I'm thinking too.
[237:41.77]Maybe the blacksmith will say something about it now.
[237:46.78]I'll go ask.
[237:55.85]Interesting.
[238:07.37]I'm gonna go down.
[238:11.20]Oh, don't care.
[238:11.72]I don't have to fight you guys.
[238:27.49]Going down here.
[238:33.98]Read the middle part of the item description.
[238:45.64]Granting the medallion with both halves conjoined will activate the Grand Lift of Dectus, connecting the Atlas Plateau to Lerunia.
[239:00.19]Grand Lift of Dectus.
[239:04.07]Grand Lift?
[239:12.40]Twelve.
[239:12.86]I thought they stopped at ten.
[239:16.90]Where's the Grand Lift of Dectus?
[239:20.60]I already got to the Atlas Plateau.
[239:23.82]Yeah.
[239:26.02]I don't know.
[239:27.78]Grand Lift.
[239:48.82]An extra area you can jump to.
[239:50.12]Yeah, I wasn't gonna just run away.
[239:57.82]Where?
[239:58.16]Over here?
[239:58.78]In the raptors?
[240:21.36]Don't let a regular enemy kill you.
[240:26.88]Okay, so... If I go up here again... Get Shido off the dirty floor.
[240:41.75]This floor is very clean.
[240:44.29]It was vacuumed.
[240:45.73]It's always been... I put soap, carpet soap on it.
[240:53.08]Okay, so from here, I jump from here to there.
[240:56.58]Or do I just go around this way somehow?
[241:02.66]Save Shito.
[241:19.33]Other ladder?
[241:25.71]Wait, there's an item right there.
[241:36.11]It's so clean, lick the floor then.
[241:57.16]Alright.
[241:58.58]Back in that rafter area.
[242:00.82]Down here.
[242:14.37]Oh, fuck!
[242:16.15]Okay.
[242:17.66]Let me get... Hold on.
[242:18.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[242:19.02]I fucking fell down.
[242:19.86]Why is this guy respawning?
[242:25.98]Why are they respawning?
[242:26.91]They shouldn't be.
[242:27.41]This is not how this game works.
[242:32.51]Eat spaghetti off the floor.
[242:41.54]Even if it was a clean carpet, imagine eating spaghetti off a carpet.
[242:58.98]I was just like, you know what, I'm gonna try to jump to that because there might be something there, like an item on the edge, and it looked like I really could get to it, and I didn't think it was gonna go that far down.
[243:14.40]It's right here, whatever.
[243:26.21]Hey, there's a gold item in there!
[243:43.36]That's the one.
[243:44.46]Oh, nice.
[243:46.36]Very nice.
[243:57.73]The other one, right?
[244:03.27]Down here.
[244:07.99]Okay, so how do I drop down from there?
[244:10.55]That was tough.
[244:30.20]Wait, it's like over there.
[244:31.16]It's over there.
[244:34.16]Oh shit.
[244:39.00]Don't make this joke anymore.
[244:40.30]Alright, so it's underneath me right now.
[244:59.85]So... I can just...
[245:06.40]Jump from here to there.
[245:07.14]I'm gonna get hit by a bat in the air.
[245:12.72]No, I need my starlight.
[245:13.72]You got a lot of fucking health, don't you?
[245:33.58]Oh, fuck!
[245:34.10]Alright, so that was crazy.
[245:41.32]I'm glad I had the light.
[245:55.71]But what's this?
[245:58.17]Radagon's Soar Seal.
[246:01.95]Ugh.
[246:08.86]greatly increases attributes, but also increases damage taken.
[246:14.46]That's a lot.
[246:18.46]That's plus five to... How come not intelligence?
[246:20.96]Oh, because I'm looking at the intelligence one, right?
[246:28.36]No int?
[246:32.99]It's plus five to everything, but not plus five to intelligence.
[246:36.47]Why not?
[246:42.69]not our mind I wonder what increases damage taken this legendary talisman is an eye engraved with an elden rune said to be the seal of king consort Radagon greatly raises vigor endurance strength and dexterity but also increases damage taken by a similar measure solemn duty weighs upon the one who beholden are not unlike a gnawing curse
[247:12.89]I wonder what the damage increase is.
[247:15.67]Because it's a separate one from magic.
[247:16.95]I guess that makes sense.
[247:18.09]But that was cool.
[247:19.64]Alright.
[247:21.00]I've cleaned up this area a little bit.
[247:22.48]There's a couple things I could probably still do.
[247:26.64]Where is this pointing me?
[247:27.76]Down here?
[247:32.92]So I wonder... Celia...
[247:41.51]Deep swamp of Aeonia.
[247:44.30]Or do I try to activate that lift?
[247:50.44]So the world ends here.
[248:00.15]So there's no more way to go up this way.
[248:02.39]There's probably a place to go here.
[248:06.29]This is a really weird map.
[248:10.98]Look at how weird this map is.
[248:16.57]So there's an area here and an area here.
[248:21.65]Nothing in the middle, nothing.
[248:22.77]It's like a big giant like circle.
[248:29.04]It looks like this land right here.
[248:32.40]Here, right?
[248:34.24]So it's a big giant circle.
[248:37.58]It's a ring!
[248:38.72]It's a giant Elden Ring!
[248:40.52]The El- the ring is the land!
[248:42.82]It's not a material thing.
[248:45.38]It's the Elden Ring is the- it's the world is really old.
[248:49.50]It's the ring.
[248:50.16]The world is the Elden Ring.
[249:00.65]Alright.
[249:03.29]Uh, somebody said go back in the tower.
[249:13.02]We did it.
[249:13.46]We beat the game.
[249:18.60]I do want to level up one more time, though.
[249:22.18]Almost there, right?
[249:27.02]39,000.
[249:27.04]I need a couple more.
[249:30.07]How much does this give?
[249:31.47]A thousand?
[249:49.76]Can't go wrong with vitality.
[249:51.50]Just can't.
[249:51.90]I'm gonna take soap off the bar because it's kind of fucking me up.
[249:56.64]And this thing is also fucking me up too.
[249:58.16]Okay, so there's more in here, somebody said.
[250:01.88]They were like, dude, go check.
[250:05.28]I was like, alright.
[250:12.64]There's another ladder that way.
[250:13.92]I'm just gonna go down there.
[250:15.14]I'm just curious.
[250:42.14]I can't It's gonna be tricky, but I'll try
[251:10.98]Newman's Rune?
[251:15.87]Newman.
[251:22.21]Used to gain a multitude of runes.
[251:24.20]The Newman are said to have come from outside the Lands Between, and are in fact of the same stock as Queen Marika.
[251:32.74]Is it like 10,000?
[251:33.32]20,000?
[251:33.50]Yeah, how much is a multitude, I wonder?
[251:38.61]Probably 20k.
[251:40.23]Or 10.
[251:40.37]Okay, well, let's go down here.
[251:58.27]Okay.
[251:59.26]What?
[252:00.04]What?
[252:01.02]Huh?
[252:01.82]I can't walk across that?
[252:02.96]I thought I could walk across it.
[252:07.18]That looked like a lip I could cross.
[252:15.49]Hold on.
[252:18.11]I don't buy it.
[252:19.05]I actually don't buy it.
[252:29.86]I don't buy it.
[252:48.92]Why would this ladder be here if you can't cross that?
[252:54.20]This ladder makes no sense unless you keep continuing this way.
[253:07.79]Yeah, what?
[253:10.31]What did I do wrong?
[253:20.55]Now what?
[253:31.77]Now what?
[253:34.43]What the hell?
[253:34.87]That's a trick.
[253:44.24]He's pointing.
[253:44.86]What the hell?
[253:46.18]Why is this ladder here?
[253:54.63]That ladder doesn't even need to be here.
[253:56.59]There's nothing I can do here.
[254:00.33]I drop down?
[254:10.29]I'm gonna just... I don't know.
[254:13.21]I don't know.
[254:13.53]I think I'm dead if I drop.
[254:18.61]Come to the gap on the other side.
[254:43.50]Okay, well, I went that way last time, right?
[254:45.56]Let's go this way.
[254:46.12]Probably inside the tower.
[254:55.70]Is it a room down here that I ran through or something?
[254:57.86]I ran by?
[254:58.32]Okay, it is right here.
[255:18.17]Don't go off the fucking edge.
[255:25.43]Oh, fucking how much can you... How can you both be copying each other's moves?
[255:32.28]You're not original.
[255:38.90]Alright.
[255:43.61]Cool, so what is this?
[255:48.63]Oh, shit.
[255:51.51]I can jump around this.
[255:56.57]Wait, investigate.
[255:58.18]Does not open from this side.
[255:59.62]Of course it doesn't.
[256:24.04]This is such a far way down.
[256:27.22]Oh my god.
[256:27.94]Okay.
[256:39.23]Um.
[256:42.36]Now what?
[256:58.96]Big golden rune?
[257:02.68]I don't have to jump on that, right?
[257:04.66]I actually have to land on that thing?
[257:10.86]I've gotta jump onto that little thing?
[257:13.77]That was way off!
[257:21.29]That was way off!
[257:23.01]Oh, there's a bonfire down here!
[257:26.25]It's a bonfire!
[257:27.73]Okay, at least I know, I know there's a bonfire where- There's a bonfire at the- That is so far, by the way.
[257:35.21]Do you see how far that is?
[257:36.89]This is gonna take me an hour.
[257:38.45]It's gonna take an hour to get down there.
[257:42.33]What the hell?
[257:46.57]I free fell.
[257:47.87]I sky dove down this whole thing.
[257:52.97]That was very far.
[258:00.34]They don't fall with me, do they?
[258:02.08]Yes, they do.
[258:02.70]Well, they're not going to make it.
[258:03.94]Oh my god, what do I do?
[258:04.56]This way.
[258:15.08]I panicked because he was following me and I forgot which way it was.
[258:19.56]Here comes the big... Yeah, this is that dumb tree area in Dark Souls 1.
[258:24.82]When we just fall down the whole... What's it called?
[258:27.36]The root?
[258:30.52]We still only have 2k runes, that's fine.
[258:31.79]I don't have the patience.
[259:11.63]They weren't even close.
[259:28.14]Oh.
[259:43.41]Maybe just a single roll?
[259:45.45]Just one singular roll.
[259:47.61]Just... And that's it.
[259:50.54]Just a single... A single roll.
[259:52.90]What about a walk?
[260:11.15]I'm gonna go for the one just...
[260:41.09]I was waiting for someone to go right by the screen.
[260:51.75]Alright.
[260:52.03]Alright, it was just walk.
[260:58.71]It was just walk.
[261:06.49]Okay.
[261:18.10]Oh my god, that one was kind of hard.
[261:20.72]And then...
[261:22.97]This one is I don't think I can make that one.
[261:49.33]I'm not fucking with this guy.
[262:14.28]I don't care how cheese ball this is.
[262:16.10]This dude lives on a ledge.
[262:19.44]Yeah.
[262:20.90]What is the point?
[262:21.64]Why is that guy here?
[262:22.58]I thought it was longer.
[262:47.80]I thought it was lo- I thought it was longer.
[262:49.82]I've been trying- I've been walking off on all these.
[262:54.27]Alright.
[262:54.49]Let's go.
[263:01.05]Let's freaking go!
[263:01.99]Oh shit, I forgot!
[263:11.86]I forgot!
[263:13.06]It's this way.
[263:14.32]Oh fuck!
[263:15.11]Oh fuck!
[263:15.53]How do I get away from these guys?
[263:17.39]God damn it!
[263:18.13]I forgot!
[263:20.01]It's not all the way and then on the ledge.
[263:21.83]It's on the ledge.
[263:22.57]I'm gonna speedrun this.
[263:25.90]I'm gonna get there now.
[263:56.24]Okay.
[264:21.19]I forgot to kill that guy.
[264:23.35]Oh, don't.
[264:33.81]He's too stupid to walk over here.
[264:42.72]Who died?
[264:43.24]Did somebody fell off?
[264:57.51]So,
[265:22.54]Just looking for items.
[265:25.00]You're not going to put an item over here FromSoftware?
[265:27.82]Yes, you are.
[265:28.64]Why wouldn't there be one in the corner?
[265:30.08]Right there.
[265:30.82]Right there.
[265:31.38]It should be.
[265:32.04]Why?
[265:32.30]Don't even let me go over here.
[265:35.48]Unless you're going to put... Wasting my time.
[265:38.79]Absolutely wasting my time.
[265:43.80]Dude, where are you getting this half-priced ganja?
[265:47.06]You smoke half-priced ganja.
[265:48.58]What is that?
[265:50.08]I got bad weed, so my brain is fucking slower?
[265:53.29]What do you mean?
[265:53.77]I don't want to go up.
[265:57.93]I want to go down.
[265:58.81]I don't want to go up.
[266:00.71]Why is this taking me up?
[266:11.43]Wait, where am I?
[266:13.90]Oh, shit.
[266:16.43]That was like a Chad walk, by the way.
[266:18.23]This guy is just... This guy... What a Chad male.
[266:28.85]He killed me.
[266:38.04]Ah!
[267:12.05]Come on.
[267:38.31]Thank you.
[268:03.10]Got him!
[268:11.64]Blackflame Monk Gauntlets.
[268:19.95]What was he hiding?
[268:27.85]Of course you were hiding an item.
[268:29.18]Of course you were.
[268:29.86]And?
[268:31.22]Aw, that's disappointing.
[268:39.85]Why can I do this?
[269:03.07]That doesn't make any sense.
[269:34.22]I want to go up the ladder though.
[269:35.21]I want to go up the ladder.
[269:44.53]I don't think I can get there from here.
[269:45.51]I think I'm stuck down here.
[270:02.38]I don't get to swing that many times in a row.
[270:04.68]That's not fair.
[270:24.02]Ooh, somebody got stuttered!
[270:26.30]It's a boss.
[270:35.28]Let's see what it is.
[270:45.02]Godskin Apostle.
[270:58.25]Thank you.
[271:29.67]Fuck you!
[271:43.20]I was healing!
[272:14.17]so so
[272:34.27]You just wait until I fucking heal before you dickhead does that throw move.
[272:39.73]You just literally stand around until I put the fucking flask up and then you throw it at me.
[272:48.64]I think I got it.
[273:04.78]Thank you.
[273:58.19]What the fuck happened?
[273:59.87]Was that a bug?
[274:01.09]No, it's a...
[274:07.01]That's a lot of damage.
[275:01.67]That's such fucking bullshit fuck that I
[275:28.47]That's a lot of damage.
[275:58.08]Thank you.
[276:40.03]Let's go!
[276:40.55]Fuck that!
[276:52.84]You drink the potion and he throws his thing at you!
[276:56.90]Ooh, I got the whole set.
[277:00.40]Bodskin Apostle Hood.
[277:02.65]Robe.
[277:03.63]Bracelets.
[277:04.61]Trousers.
[277:10.18]Fuck!
[277:17.94]That was crazy.
[277:27.67]Wood made by sewing together patches of smooth skin.
[277:30.47]Oh!
[277:30.65]Ew!
[277:32.77]Overreaction for the YouTube video!
[277:34.81]Yucky!
[277:35.37]It's skin?
[277:45.26]No bonuses to anything.
[277:53.98]That's a lot of magic resistance though.
[277:56.58]It's actually just skin.
[278:06.05]Look at that poise.
[278:06.81]That poise is awful.
[278:10.57]Let's see what it looks like.
[278:17.88]No gloves?
[278:20.70]Where are they?
[278:34.55]Oh my god.
[278:35.93]I don't want to look at that.
[278:38.44]This is horrible.
[278:54.02]Oh, it's so awful.
[278:55.48]Like, it just looks... I hate every second of that.
[278:59.85]Give me back my fucking dunce comedy outfit.
[279:11.43]Wait, maybe I'll keep the... Oh, actually, that actually matches the helmet.
[279:23.21]Okay, I like the pants.
[279:24.53]They match the head.
[279:28.47]I got 100,000 souls, and I gotta be careful here.
[279:35.12]Human skin versus comedy outfit.
[279:36.74]There's a chest in here, too.
[279:40.70]Is this a joke chest?
[279:41.52]Why would there be a chest here?
[279:51.21]Oh, don't put that in here.
[279:52.53]God Slayer's Greatsword.
[280:03.48]What?
[280:05.10]Sacred Sword of the Dusk-Eyed Queen who controlled the Godskin Apostles before her defeat at the hands of Maliketh.
[280:13.70]Black flames wielded by the apostles are channeled from this sword.
[280:17.60]Unique skill, the queen's black flame.
[280:21.41]Set the blade ablaze with the god-slaying black flame before delivering a sweeping slash.
[280:27.43]Additional input allows for a follow-up attack.
[280:31.44]Black flames will continue to wear down HP for a while.
[280:34.70]What?
[280:37.94]This thing is insane looking.
[280:41.62]Look at this thing.
[280:45.22]Wow.
[280:46.74]That's probably the coolest weapon in the game.
[280:49.06]Like, in regards to how it looks.
[280:51.40]I don't have enough mana to do it.
[281:00.34]That's so cool looking.
[281:06.83]I can't- I don't have any mana to do the thing, but it still looks awesome.
[281:13.50]This is one of the best weapons in the game.
[281:15.04]You should use the flame.
[281:16.18]I imagine it's pretty similar to what these guys are doing to me up here.
[281:26.43]Okay, but that's not the only thing that's down.
[281:28.33]I, like, ran away.
[281:31.05]I'll check that out in a minute.
[281:32.02]Look at how many cool weapons are in this game.
[281:36.10]You know, I will say Elden Ring versus all the other Souls games...
[281:41.58]There's a lot less, at least maybe my brain is remembering this wrong.
[281:46.19]I feel like there's a lot of really cool items.
[281:51.67]It's not just like short sword, long sword, zwander, claymore, right?
[281:57.01]I feel like there's a ton of these unique weapons.
[282:00.69]A lot more.
[282:04.70]90% of them are suck, though.
[282:06.72]Yeah, but I don't think that matters.
[282:08.15]I think it's fun to take... Decide on a playthrough where you're gonna use... You know what?
[282:13.35]Like, I'm... I'm using the Reduvia in this playthrough.
[282:20.51]Only about that's really, like, actually interesting.
[282:23.56]Like, the dismounter.
[282:24.46]I'm gonna use this.
[282:24.94]Alright.
[282:28.94]So, that was cool.
[282:32.46]Actually, I don't want to lose these souls, so I gotta be really careful here.
[282:34.98]Yeah, uh, we're not gonna do this.
[282:37.17]I can now put the staff on.
[282:54.67]Oh, I need one more!
[282:59.74]Shit.
[283:03.27]I got this thing, too.
[283:07.52]I gotta go back to the town.
[283:08.94]I got a lot of shit to look through.
[283:10.46]Hold on.
[283:10.80]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[283:12.34]Here's what we're gonna do.
[283:13.06]I'm going back to town.
[283:16.98]I gotta go find it, because that's a boss soul weapon.
[283:25.18]That is a boss soul weapon.
[283:32.88]cool int weapon or it's just another level which I'll take either one alright what's what is this bastard stars what is this thing what is this thing
[284:00.54]It's a flail?
[284:01.56]It's a magic flail?
[284:03.20]What?
[284:04.16]Oh my goodness.
[284:12.63]It's a solar system flail.
[284:18.41]Ash of war, waves of darkness.
[284:23.63]It's like a big... No.
[284:42.31]D&C scaling.
[284:43.36]It's a flail.
[284:45.32]It's dex int.
[284:48.10]YouTube reaction for the YouTube video.
[284:52.80]Look, it needs 22 dex as well.
[284:54.92]Like, this is an annoying, weird weapon to get, right?
[285:00.02]Because you have to put, like, 10 to 15.
[285:02.36]You gotta put, like, at least 10 points in dex to have this item, and nobody's gonna do that.
[285:10.22]Like, that's... I don't... I mean, at least not till late, late game, probably, right?
[285:17.41]It's expensive, and... I got it.
[285:22.64]I just want to look at it.
[285:38.65]What the hell?
[285:39.63]It's so weird.
[285:43.89]It's actually a solar system.
[285:52.88]I wanna see what the- I wanna see what the power does.
[285:54.40]We're just gonna go to, like, Lengrave or something.
[286:02.36]It's a baby rattle.
[286:09.19]Baby rattle alright.
[286:10.65]I need to take the helmet off take the shirt off put a diaper on Okay, does anything look like a diaper in the game because I will use the baby.
[286:16.85]I will be baby character Okay, let's see Oh
[286:47.13]Let's test it out on some sheep.
[286:54.42]That does a lot of damage just like in general.
[287:02.98]It's not even leveled up.
[287:05.27]That was 256 damage from the swing.
[287:07.37]And it has not even... It's not... It's zero.
[287:08.93]Plus zero.
[287:17.62]But it's... But I have so many cool fucking weapons, though.
[287:20.82]That's the problem.
[287:32.01]Does it have an L2 combo?
[287:36.08]That was not... Let me try it again.
[287:41.26]L2, L2... I mean, you're very vulnerable right here, because it's like 1, 2, 3, 4.
[287:50.63]It's about 4 full seconds.
[287:52.61]Alright, it's decision time.
[288:00.85]This is a big decision.
[288:02.83]I want all of you to... We're going to do this democratically.
[288:13.63]We're gonna do this, we're gonna do this democratically.
[288:15.57]That's how it's gonna work.
[288:27.59]Where's the, where is it?
[288:36.11]Okay, are you guys ready?
[288:37.21]We're gonna devote this one out of four items here.
[288:44.21]L2, R2.
[288:52.08]Alright.
[288:53.22]Baby flail.
[288:58.42]Baby flail.
[288:59.88]I want you to get a good look at it.
[289:02.21]I'm gonna see... I am a big baby.
[289:05.99]No, don't... Okay.
[289:07.79]People are gonna vote for this because of that.
[289:09.63]People... Everyone's gonna click on this because of what they're looking on the screen right now.
[289:14.21]I need to put a pair of pants on so people don't fucking automatically pick this because... Okay, that made it worse.
[289:20.77]That made it way worse.
[289:23.11]That made it way worse.
[289:25.25]Something that doesn't look like a fucking baby diaper.
[289:27.42]Okay.
[289:30.82]Okay.
[289:31.78]Here we go.
[289:32.42]Baby rattle.
[289:34.18]Cool animation.
[289:35.65]It's got the big explosion thing.
[289:38.13]It's pretty cool.
[289:39.39]It's pretty sick.
[289:43.21]Pretty cool weapon.
[289:45.59]Let's take a look at that again.
[289:47.69]Bang.
[289:48.05]Boom.
[289:48.63]Pretty cool.
[289:50.22]We also have... Bug arm.
[289:53.86]Bug leaf.
[289:56.16]So this thing is like a scimitar.
[289:58.58]Got a pretty good swing.
[290:00.76]Also has does not take intelligence to do this.
[290:05.60]It has a big intelligence scaling magic weapon.
[290:11.93]Also, it's got its own version of the baby rattle, although this one is better.
[290:19.91]That happens faster.
[290:20.91]It might not do as much damage.
[290:21.97]I'm not sure.
[290:24.74]Bug wing.
[290:28.92]That does not take intelligence.
[290:35.06]Pretty sick.
[290:36.18]We also have Moonvale.
[290:39.79]Now if you don't know what Moonvale is, Moonvale is the thing that has been carrying us through the entire midgame.
[290:44.31]We'll call it the Styrofoam sword.
[290:48.20]If you want to get a good look, it's Styrofoam.
[290:51.50]So, styrofoam sword.
[290:52.86]Boom.
[290:54.55]Take a look at this.
[290:55.55]Wham.

[290:58.11]Whoosh.
[290:59.33]Big intelligence move.
[291:00.87]Unbelievably beautiful.
[291:02.63]Everyone's not going to vote for this because the katana.
[291:05.25]And all katanas are shitty loser weapons in these games, from what I've been told.
[291:10.02]So, but it's incredible.
[291:12.72]Finally, we've got this.
[291:23.80]Finally, we've got the Moonlit Greatsword.
[291:28.97]A staple in FromSoftware, and a weapon that is, in every single one of these games, it can turn into a big bright night light, which then has this awesome beauty.
[291:40.64]It's frost damage, shoots out these cool projectiles, also does not take mana to do that.
[291:53.79]Very cool.
[291:57.03]So.
[291:57.09]What do we have?
[292:00.23]AB Rattle.
[292:02.54]Styrofoam Katana.
[292:05.22]Bugwing.
[292:06.96]Moonlit Sword.

[292:41.83]I don't think I have enough ability.
[292:43.17]I can't turn it on.
[292:44.13]The game won't let me turn the cool thing on.
[292:52.32]Alright, is it Baby Rattle or Bugwing?
[292:57.62]Okay, Baby Rattle is currently winning.
[292:59.80]Bugwing is really close.
[293:07.15]I can't even activate the power because I'm not tall enough.
[293:12.19]Unfortunately.
[293:13.15]You're going to have to do a redo.
[293:18.51]Alright, Baby Rattle won.
[293:21.13]I'm thinking...
[293:26.27]This weapon better be fucking good.
[293:47.46]The baby!
[293:48.26]I don't think I... Actually, I don't know if I want to play as the baby.
[293:52.57]Should I not play as baby?
[293:56.33]Okay, we're gonna do a vote between baby rattle and bug wing because those are the two that won so now everybody gets a choice Baby rattle and bug wing are now you get the real choice of real choices here Pretty damn cool, but what about this one?

[295:18.85]Okay, baby.
[295:20.54]Oh, what about the bug wing?
[295:34.35]I can't.
[295:35.23]It's been pacified.

[295:49.86]But have you seen... But have you seen Bugwing?
[296:31.62]fucking like Redesign your character to look like a baby Okay, I'll be honest people like saying oh no he's doing a meme now, and he was doing so well this apparently is one of the best intelligence weapons in the game, so I
[297:10.56]How do I not have a regular Somber Smithing Stone?
[297:15.74]Doesn't seem impossible.
[297:24.29]Alright, I know what I'm doing, but...
[297:29.14]Can't do it yet.
[297:29.84]I can almost put this on, which is going to be a huge deal.
[297:33.38]I can go back to actually casting sorceries again.
[297:35.24]Are these better?
[297:51.52]Kind of are.
[297:56.98]Yeah, they just are.
[298:04.18]I know.
[298:04.52]Boo, boo, boo.

[298:30.85]Holy shit.
[298:45.35]This blacksmith sells those stones?
[298:47.07]Does he?
[298:47.59]Can't buy them.
[298:55.79]The fat guy on the bridge has a literal diaper.
[298:59.91]Are you being serious?
[299:09.55]Plus eight mimic, by the way.
[299:13.58]Oleg's next.
[299:14.20]There's gonna be two babies running around.
[299:20.28]A giant blacksmith.
[299:26.87]Alright, where is the giant blacksmith?
[299:33.01]He's over here somewhere, right?
[299:35.97]He's like this way, isn't he?
[299:39.52]He's like, don't go over to the manor.
[299:41.52]You'd be foolish.
[299:42.48]Alright, what do you got?
[299:55.87]Oh, there you are.
[299:57.13]Have you heard?
[299:59.34]Lady Ranni has departed on her journey along the dark path of the Empyrean from Renna's Rise.
[300:07.32]Blame the teething ring and become the baby lord.
[300:10.18]It would not have been possible without you.
[300:13.26]As Lady Ranni's war counselor and moreover her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude.
[300:23.62]You and both.
[300:31.44]Talk or talk?
[300:33.06]No, talk or talk?
[300:56.34]E-scaling coming up.

[301:03.39]Got them.
[301:08.61]What is that?
[301:12.63]What is this?
[301:13.59]What?
[301:15.53]Lowers FP consumed by skills.
[301:17.33]I didn't see that.
[301:18.05]The skill technically is... Okay, I need 6,000 souls.
[301:23.64]Shouldn't have upgraded that fucking gimmick.
[301:26.80]Alright, let's just go get some souls.
[301:36.10]What's the quickest place for me to get souls right now?
[301:41.00]I could go fight the baby diaper lady.
[301:44.84]Where was that?
[301:45.34]It was like here somewhere, right?
[301:46.62]Yeah.
[301:54.65]Go get the diaper.
[302:00.63]I'll try.
[302:04.66]I will, honest to God, try.
[302:05.94]Uh, not here.
[302:12.10]Wrong bridge?
[302:13.64]Where was it?
[302:14.00]Well, this is the right bridge, right?
[302:21.75]Oh, no, it's this one, isn't it?
[302:22.83]I think it's this one.
[302:28.41]This is it.
[302:37.41]Alright, let's do it.
[302:42.78]I'm a lot more leveled up now.
[302:44.08]This should be a pretty decent encounter.
[302:46.66]It shouldn't be too hard.
[302:52.96]The bug is way cooler.
[302:53.84]It's too bad chat voted.
[302:55.46]Thing is, there's enough materials.
[302:56.98]I could use them both.
[302:59.22]Let's kill it.
[302:59.80]But I'm going to lean into this for just a few moments.
[303:04.47]Let's go.
[303:20.01]it's going way better still hurts
[303:43.47]Stop rolling!
[304:02.36]Ouch.
[304:17.13]Wow, even with the bubble on, that fucking hurt.
[304:23.51]Wow.
[304:51.63]Nonsense!
[305:24.53]SWING NO FUCKING STAMINA REMAINING IN MY INVENTORY!
[305:29.32]Get outta here.
[305:40.26]Old skin noble hood?
[305:42.74]Noble robe.
[305:44.47]Noble bracelets, noble trousers.
[305:46.35]What?
[305:48.35]There's more of this shit?
[305:58.40]Apostle noble No
[306:44.66]It has a bib.
[306:50.34]Let me look at this, because I... Actually, the defense is really not that bad.
[306:59.73]Defense is okay, actually.
[307:01.29]I'm not against it.
[307:09.07]It's like baby birth... It's like birthday boy.
[307:13.55]It's my birthday.
[307:15.03]Fuck, okay.
[307:26.93]I need pants though, dude.
[307:28.19]I can't just run around like a fucking idiot.
[307:35.56]No, no pants.
[307:50.81]We're on the commoner's trousers.
[307:53.49]You can- Whoa, you can see my ass!
[307:58.19]Wait, you can see that much?
[307:59.87]He's naked!
[308:03.77]You can see so much?
[308:06.45]What the fuck?
[308:12.08]That's fucking ridiculous.
[308:14.26]Why?
[308:17.90]What- Hold on.
[308:18.94]What does that actually look like?
[308:23.70]I feel like there's less when I have this on.
[308:34.29]Is it like... Is it... Is it like... He's an ass... No, I'm not ass inspecting.
[308:41.99]I'm not... I'm just... That was weird to see.
[308:44.61]Okay, I'm going back to the blacksmith room.
[309:02.99]Where the fuck am I?
[309:19.12]Where is he?
[309:23.07]Oh.
[309:23.97]I thought he was a rock.
[309:26.29]Well, as the war comes...
[309:32.86]I don't think I have enough to level up, do I?
[309:37.56]Alright.
[309:42.65]This actually, I'm not even kidding around, is probably going to end up doing a ton of damage.
[309:49.43]I need another thousand souls.
[310:08.32]We're gonna get 1,000 souls.
[310:09.46]We're gonna get like 5,000 souls quick.
[310:12.84]Like very quick.
[310:21.43]Dogs down here.
[310:22.15]I guess I could just go.
[310:23.17]But no, they're only giving like 200.
[310:24.43]Maybe just sell some weapons and armor.
[310:30.33]People got mad at me when I did that last time.
[310:33.21]I'm just gonna go to where I kind of like this area here.
[310:35.77]There's a bunch of random shit I can kill.
[310:40.72]So did I?
[310:41.26]Is that it for Kalid?
[310:44.06]I don't think I did this.
[310:48.90]Yeah, let me investigate some of this stuff here.
[310:56.76]Because there was this thing here.
[311:03.19]Where is this?
[311:04.15]Because this is like along this road.
[311:05.53]Alright, I'm going to go here.
[311:11.29]I'll go do that dungeon.
[311:17.25]This is not upgraded all the way, and this is not final.
[311:20.70]But I'm curious how much damage this does at like a plus 4 or plus 5.
[311:32.62]I mean, for having a bunch of enemies... If you get surrounded by enemies, that's like an absolute oh shit button.
[311:38.93]Let's try it.
[311:49.04]To be interrupted.
[312:01.51]It's doing a decent amount.
[312:05.15]Once it's leveled up, it'll be better.
[312:19.58]Staggers.
[312:20.06]It's really pretty.
[312:25.38]It sucks.
[312:25.96]Stop!
[312:26.56]It does.
[312:28.92]I wasted.
[312:29.44]No, I didn't.
[312:29.98]I'm going to wait until it's leveled up a little more.
[312:38.85]It's not even leveled up.
[312:42.19]Wait till it's leveled up.
[312:43.39]Another two, three times.
[312:47.39]Look at that.
[313:02.45]It staggers big time.
[313:27.25]The baby sucks.
[313:39.81]It's not fair to talk about it yet.
[313:47.59]I'm not giving up on it yet.
[313:56.35]It seems like it's... This is not leveled for the enemies I'm fighting.
[314:06.38]That's stupid.
[314:07.18]I don't care.
[314:08.38]Instant kill moves are dumb.
[314:12.68]Instant kill moves are dumb.
[314:17.19]Let me say it again.
[314:19.37]Instant kill moves are stupid.
[314:25.77]Alright.
[314:42.88]You're not fully armored?
[314:43.78]I know.
[314:47.20]Ratio.
[314:48.00]Don't ratio me.
[314:49.04]Actually, it is getting a lot better.
[315:12.04]157 plus 148.
[315:13.30]It's starting to get actually pretty good.
[315:17.02]What's the katana right now?
[315:25.37]Katana is plus 8.
[315:26.67]It's 187 plus 148.
[315:42.63]168 plus 166.
[315:45.63]Kana is so much better by like an insane order of magnitude.
[316:04.97]You want me to try it with the boss and give up after 30 minutes and rant about how much it sucks for 30 minutes?
[316:14.77]Yeah, no.
[316:16.01]What the hell?
[316:16.49]Did you hear my voice?
[316:17.31]Yeah.
[316:18.67]What was that fucking weird thing that I just did?
[316:20.83]Alright.
[316:50.17]Let me take a look.
[316:50.87]157 plus 148.
[316:51.63]187 plus 148.
[316:51.88]This is plus 7.
[316:53.64]This is plus 8.
[316:54.18]I'll try it for a while.
[317:20.77]I do need some more souls to get it to the same place.
[317:23.59]Okay, so I... How many plus nine smithing stones do I have?
[317:30.92]I only have one plus nine Smithing Stone right now.
[317:35.44]And I am abso-fucking-lutely not going to use it on the baby rattle.
[317:38.51]And... Until... Stars have higher int scaling.
[317:55.23]Alright.
[317:55.47]Because I can get this to... I'm willing to get this to plus eight.
[318:03.11]And try it.
[318:03.53]But I need some more souls.
[318:06.19]I'm going to sell a couple of things.
[318:07.37]That's easy.
[318:09.31]I can't.
[318:09.77]Let's talk talk.
[318:10.49]You get so many somber stones.
[318:12.95]Yeah, I know.
[318:14.25]Wait, blight.
[318:14.71]Blight.
[318:29.24]My purpose is nearing its end.
[318:32.79]I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember.
[318:36.45]It has been a long and wondrous journey.
[318:40.39]Now Lady Ranni is in your hands, I pray that you serve her well.
[318:46.04]Okay.
[318:46.30]What about Blade?
[318:47.18]Send underground?
[318:48.76]What?
[318:49.12]I already did that, man.
[318:50.40]Alright.
[318:50.86]I need 1575.
[319:14.66]So, let me just go get a thousand souls in two seconds.
[319:22.98]If you kill one boss with a baby weapon, then it deserves a plus nine.
[319:36.89]Why did I come here?
[319:37.53]This is my least favorite area in the whole game.
[320:02.65]I haven't been able to swing
[320:17.88]Why did I come here?
[320:18.58]This place sucks ass.
[320:20.28]Why would I... Why did I come to this area?
[320:34.07]No, it's not the weapon.
[320:35.17]The baby rattle is gonna be sick.
[320:37.41]Trust me.
[320:42.56]It's gonna work out.
[320:43.48]It's gonna work out.
[320:44.02]It's gonna be good.
[320:52.12]Just out of spite, I'm going to murder this motherfucker right now.
[321:05.78]Okay, that's hitting for pretty hard.
[321:07.58]480?
[321:09.63]That's actually not bad.
[321:11.47]That's actually really good.
[321:13.19]Okay.
[321:26.48]Did I baby rattle too hard?
[321:29.34]What's wrong with the baby?
[321:31.00]What's wrong with the baby?
[321:33.41]What's happening to the baby?
[321:47.59]I can't even fucking run away from these things.
[321:57.10]Thanks for the thousand souls.
[322:02.77]Now fucking eat my ass.
[322:08.13]I need a little bit more.
[322:10.47]Just attack them.
[322:12.10]Add a forehead to your comment because I- I just- I'd say forehead too.
[322:40.99]Junior, cover your ears.
[322:42.09]Junior, cover your ears, he's cursing again.
[322:49.69]Here we go.
[322:50.89]I am willing to get this to plus 8.
[322:53.11]It's there.
[322:53.55]I am at plus 168 plus 166.
[322:56.34]This becomes C scaling here, by the way.
[323:01.48]Dex C. Int B. This is doing a lot of damage now.
[323:09.36]I'm not willing to do plus 9 on this.
[323:11.07]I don't know what I want to do plus 9.
[323:16.62]Now we're gonna actually play the game.
[323:19.20]I've got some good shit.
[323:21.00]I'm ready.
[323:21.38]I'm all geared up.
[323:24.92]I'm ready.
[323:27.38]I wanted to go check out this down here.
[323:32.81]How do I get here?
[323:33.85]Let's start from here.
[323:36.23]No wrong.
[323:48.20]This is wrong, right?
[323:50.86]Yes, this is wrong.
[324:00.77]Okay.
[324:04.95]So, where is this dungeon?
[324:08.37]I'm assuming probably on the road.
[324:11.33]Go down from the road, maybe?
[324:15.41]If I were to go... Get this way, maybe.
[324:19.09]I don't know.
[324:21.41]What boss has been the scariest so far?
[324:24.05]Um... Scary as in design?
[324:28.90]Or scary as in... God, I don't want to do that fight ever again.
[324:32.74]Which one?
[324:33.08]Okay, so I need to go up here.
[324:42.52]Ulf?
[324:43.82]Well, I never want to do that fight ever again.
[324:45.28]It's probably overdone.
[324:47.36]I just found that fight to be just a monster gimmick.
[324:51.36]It was just like a frustrating gimmick fight that I hated.
[324:54.69]I'd say that one.
[324:56.61]If you're talking about like scary and creepy and just designed really, really... Probably the big... The thing where I got the baby rattle from.
[325:06.92]Big astral like centipede bug praying mantis thing.
[325:22.85]Yeah.
[325:22.97]The nerds rope.
[325:24.41]Astral.
[325:24.95]Yeah.
[325:25.65]The nerds rope boss.
[325:27.65]That was just crazy looking.
[325:29.01]It had the whole solar system on its tail.
[325:30.89]It was really cool.
[325:32.96]Alright.
[325:33.84]So now the idea is can I go... Where's this road?
[325:51.58]That's not a road.
[325:52.57]It's not a road?
[325:53.21]What is it?
[326:00.47]So where's the dungeon?
[326:02.85]Down at the boss area?
[326:08.14]So what, do I have to go up this way from the boss area?
[326:11.10]Because I can't get down there from here.
[326:12.20]I guess so.
[326:25.03]Interesting.
[326:25.76]Okay, so it's this way.
[326:32.69]Let's go, big baby.
[326:33.79]We're gonna go find... We're gonna go prove to everybody that this was not a stupid idea to waste a bunch of somber smithing stones.
[327:02.18]It's the painting.
[327:07.02]It is the painting.
[327:07.82]Is this just a painting dungeon?
[327:44.42]Soul of the Painter.
[327:45.51]So that's up though.
[327:48.85]That's right there.
[328:15.54]That kind of looks like it's right here.
[328:18.42]Maybe a little bit higher?
[328:38.64]It's like up there.
[328:40.12]Where am I right now?
[328:43.00]Yeah, it's right here.
[328:45.15]Okay, I'm going to mark this with an actual marker.
[328:49.50]Called, um... That.
[328:53.79]It's definitely right there.
[329:15.46]Dude.
[329:17.58]How much further down is this dungeon?
[329:36.69]Holy shit, there it is.
[329:38.11]You look like such a fucking jackass.
[329:54.02]I want the ones that match.
[329:55.10]Match, right?
[329:58.42]I want the ones that matched.
[330:00.98]I think it was these ones.
[330:10.71]Yeah, this matches.
[330:21.43]War dead catacombs.
[330:25.49]Let's try it.
[330:29.52]This place is very hard.
[330:34.86]Well.
[330:37.32]Great opportunity to try the baby rattle.
[330:58.34]Let's go.
[331:26.77]Who just hit me?
[331:30.99]That.
[331:33.50]Fuck you for standing here like an idiot.
[331:49.30]so so
[332:20.80]Where'd he go?
[332:21.24]Where's the big guy?
[332:34.72]I mean, I'm gonna die from the rot, so... What's the point?
[332:37.60]Just run around for a minute.
[332:40.08]Oh, there you are!
[332:40.80]There's a chest right there, bro!
[332:52.09]Oh, come on.
[333:00.70]Collapsing stars.
[333:05.38]I got it.
[333:12.16]I'll be able to put some of these new insane sorcery moves on soon.
[333:24.22]I got at least 3 or 4 that I need at least 50.
[333:27.42]Which I'm getting there.
[333:28.74]I think I need one more point in intelligence.
[333:30.16]Yep.
[333:32.52]I need one more point in intelligence and we can get started with that sorcery shit.
[333:40.76]Okay.
[333:41.32]Let's just keep going.
[333:51.00]I don't think it's even worth fighting a lot of these guys.
[333:55.79]I got the chest.
[333:56.63]There's probably something else down here.
[333:58.53]Maybe another time.
[334:01.35]Ooh, Grave Glove Warp.
[334:24.24]If they're just going to fight each other, then they're just going to fight each other, so who cares?
[334:26.70]Huh?
[334:34.70]He shot me through a wall?
[334:43.53]I didn't know the timings on it, but I got hit through a wall.
[334:46.51]He hit me through a wall.
[334:51.37]That was dumb.
[335:00.94]No, it wasn't.
[335:01.58]Yes, it was.
[335:02.30]Nobody argues with the giant baby.
[335:06.95]I'm playing the perfect streamer character.
[335:11.95]This is my punishment.
[335:13.91]Be like the big whiny baby character.
[335:27.46]Oh fuck.
[336:13.61]So, let's go.
[336:33.23]Thank you.
[336:59.88]BabyRage.
[337:00.84]I can go that way, but not yet.
[337:13.59]Holy shit, you got a lot of health.
[337:19.06]Damn man.
[337:48.10]Get out of my way.
[337:48.74]155 damage.
[337:51.08]Oh, mega lul.
[337:51.90]It's not bad.
[337:52.86]It just needs a little getting used to. ...
[338:18.52]Okay.
[338:23.01]You're getting used to sucking.
[338:26.91]Oh, good thing I fucking dodged that accidentally.
[338:49.24]Holy shit.
[338:54.26]They should be able to get hit more than once with that.
[338:57.86]Baby rattle would be a lot better if they could get hit by more than one of those.
[339:04.17]That would be actually awesome.
[339:07.97]Instead, it gives them invulnerability.
[339:10.29]You know that word.
[339:14.78]You got a spear.
[339:15.62]I hate spears.
[339:22.01]Holy shit.
[339:22.65]He's got a teleporter.
[339:25.15]I thought I had time.
[339:33.99]This is...
[340:04.94]Punk.
[340:05.10]Actual punk.
[340:43.12]Can we get out of the fucking corridor?
[340:45.57]GET OUT OF THE CORRIDOR!
[341:08.56]Oh!
[341:20.72]Fuck!
[341:23.68]Oh...
[341:33.73]AB needs his- I'm not gonna say that out loud.
[341:57.93]It was just- what?
[341:58.89]There was just fucking flowers in here?
[342:00.83]That's why I fought all the way through that?
[342:05.50]Flowers.
[342:05.91]I did that for a flower.
[342:32.28]Those alive?
[342:32.88]Those are alive.
[342:42.95]Hey!
[342:45.31]Oh, through the window.
[342:46.57]Yup.
[342:47.01]Thanks.
[342:47.83]Yeah, right.
[342:53.75]Through the window.
[342:55.89]Bullshit.
[343:04.98]I have no mana left.
[343:05.74]I'm gonna pull him.
[343:12.76]Come down here and fight me.
[343:15.34]Come over here, coward.
[343:16.84]Coward.
[343:17.18]Come over here, coward.
[343:18.64]Come over here, coward.
[343:20.18]That guy flipped me off.
[343:35.00]Ayy!
[343:39.06]Never leave your post!
[344:06.18]Somebody else can fucking deal with you, man.
[344:11.43]Oh, don't forget about the glove ward.
[344:12.75]Of course.
[344:13.23]That's why I came all the way down here.
[344:47.23]Did I do everything?
[344:49.93]There's probably a boss down here.
[344:51.07]I feel like I didn't see everything.
[345:07.19]Alright, back to it.
[345:09.29]So wait, which way did I not go?
[345:10.57]Oh, straight through.
[345:14.21]I didn't go straight through here.
[345:33.18]Need to level up.
[345:36.91]Walked by a contraption.
[345:39.89]Oh, great.
[345:42.83]Fuck this game.
[345:47.31]Walked by a contraption.
[345:58.03]Fuck this game.
[345:59.41]And... They take so long.
[346:01.21]It's like... One... Two... Three... Then he lets go.
[346:10.37]this game yikes
[346:37.83]I'm not dodging, I don't care.
[346:53.92]Okay.
[346:56.96]What the heck's happening here?
[346:57.90]I see... stuff.
[347:00.10]Does it matter?
[347:00.60]What do I need to do?
[347:02.72]Holy shit!
[347:03.52]I didn't know he was fucking... I thought he was shooting the bow and arrow!
[347:06.40]Why did he come over here?
[347:23.26]What the fuck?
[347:24.26]I hate you.
[347:28.06]I don't know.
[347:33.73]Um...
[347:43.01]this way.
[347:59.67]I had that back stab.
[348:17.70]I don't want to fight him anyway.
[348:21.34]I don't want to fight that guy, so I don't care.
[348:24.18]There it is.
[348:30.35]Thank you.
[349:16.46]I'm farming for soul, so I don't want to die to the boss.
[349:18.42]The boss is probably going to be hard.
[349:35.49]Yeah.
[349:39.43]Well, it's open, but... There's no boss fog?
[349:43.97]Yeah, there is.
[349:44.33]Okay.
[349:44.61]Alright, this is gonna be fun.
[349:47.65]Ah, this is gonna be fun.
[349:51.74]Time to throw a tantrum.
[350:02.00]I mean it does a lot of damage it just takes a long time to happen and it's cool
[350:23.42]When it hits, it's really cool.
[350:34.83]I mean, it's awesome.
[350:36.41]It's really cool.
[350:37.09]The move is amazing when it hits.
[350:50.82]That does like 900 damage if it actually lands.
[350:59.37]550.
[350:59.43]I mean, it's good.
[351:00.21]I mean, look at that.
[351:07.04]600.
[351:07.12]That did 1200 damage if it hits.
[351:16.17]I think I have enough.
[351:27.04]What is it?
[351:30.72]40,000?
[351:30.74]42,000?
[351:30.76]Kill one more.
[351:31.10]Okay.
[351:41.00]If it hits, yes, that's true.
[351:43.28]Not fighting that guy.
[351:54.23]Grab the katana again.
[351:58.95]Um... I mean, I love the katana.
[352:04.45]42, of course it is.
[352:07.78]I'll just walk it off.
[352:10.44]This weapon's driving me insane.
[352:12.84]Why is this weapon... Why is it driving you insane? ...
[352:41.62]It's a cool weapon.
[352:59.64]It's bad.
[353:00.16]Yeah, it is.
[353:01.30]But that doesn't mean you can't have fun with a bad weapon.
[353:06.08]It's not even a bad weapon.
[353:08.12]It's really not.
[353:17.22]She's got bad range.
[353:18.48]Yeah.
[353:27.69]You know why the katana really is better?
[353:29.73]And why the katana is like one of the best weapons in the whole game?
[353:32.40]Because it has bleed.
[353:38.75]Alright, we just unlocked a very important milestone.
[353:41.63]I have 52 intelligence, which means... Boys and girls.
[353:53.98]Got it.
[353:54.28]I can actually use this thing.
[354:02.51]Actually use it.
[354:09.30]Look at the speed!
[354:10.04]Look at the speed!
[354:10.84]How much is the long... That does happen way faster.
[354:20.48]If you don't know why I've been putting points into intelligence, not just for the scaling, also because this thing makes all of my sorceries cast speed way higher.
[354:34.37]And new spells too, that's right.
[354:36.05]But, we will play with those very shortly.
[354:40.83]What I want to do right now is just go get my ass kicked from a boss that's in this room.
[354:44.31]I don't care.
[354:47.67]I'm not trying to... I'm just trying to see what the boss's moves are.
[354:50.82]I don't really give a shit about beating it to the start.
[354:55.10]It's going to be really fun when I start actively... actively complaining about how bad this weapon is.
[355:02.98]After losing to the first... The boss is going to do two moves and hurt me and kill me.
[355:08.28]Putrid Tree... It's just another one of these.
[355:27.28]Still hit me?
[356:15.17]Fuck, wrong, fast!
[356:23.54]Shit, it's a little longer.
[356:40.84]Oh, fuck.
[357:06.17]Wasn't bad.
[357:10.86]Okay.
[357:19.88]Wasn't bad.
[357:20.34]It actually did some pretty decent damage.
[357:24.09]What?
[357:27.06]We're gonna do a test.
[357:27.78]Let's see.
[357:31.32]Let's see how this is.
[357:35.06]The bit is over.
[357:36.28]Go back to the real weapon.
[357:44.27]I think it's actually doable.
[357:51.65]Because that was doing about 1200 damage, but it just takes a long time.
[357:55.01]Let's see how much this does in comparison.
[357:58.57]I know.
[358:02.14]It's not even a fucking contest.
[358:14.25]Like, that's not even a contest.
[358:24.05]Happens so much faster.
[358:59.59]And the stagger.
[359:21.58]And Grady.
[359:25.22]This thing is fucking... This weapon is unbelievable.
[359:44.70]Thank you.
[360:28.18]Goodbye.
[360:42.41]First try with the fucking katana.
[360:44.99]Fucking fucker.
[360:46.27]The katana's insane.
[360:48.57]The katana's insane.
[360:58.99]Katana is staggering like a two-handed hammer.
[361:04.85]Damn.
[361:14.24]I think we're just spoiled by how good the Katana really is.
[361:17.90]And that's a new name spirit, too.
[361:23.95]Alright, so here's the play.
[361:25.25]Here's your play.
[361:27.57]I want to play with the baby rattle.
[361:29.83]I actually do want to play with it.
[361:31.15]I don't think we gave it enough chance.
[361:32.99]By the way, it's time to upgrade sorcery shit.
[361:41.44]I got a flask upgrade.
[361:44.44]I want to go back to using sorcery.
[361:50.14]So, this is how we do it.
[361:55.72]I got a bunch of new sorceries I can do.
[362:02.02]And look, if a boss is giving me too much trouble, then whip out the fucking katana and slit his head off.
[362:14.88]Okay, so I got a lot of souls.
[362:16.00]It's time to leave.
[362:16.52]I got a bunch of ashes too, right?
[362:27.44]There's a casting speed talisman?
[362:29.18]Wow.
[362:32.24]Where is this?
[362:33.42]Right here.
[362:35.43]A-Lid.
[362:36.65]This edge here.
[362:37.47]I mean, that boss was like kind of... Alright.
[362:41.17]The reason why... So that boss...
[362:45.54]Remember the first time I fought that boss?
[362:48.03]It was like 10 levels underleveled for it.
[362:51.51]We've seen that same snake, lizard, monster enemy like three times now.
[362:56.75]So I kind of already knew the moveset.
[362:59.65]So I was pretty prepared for that.
[363:04.38]It was the same exact moveset.
[363:06.02]The only difference was it was rot instead of lightning.
[363:11.16]So there's quite a few of those.
[363:14.67]Let's level up.
[363:28.66]Alright, it's time to examine some spells that I can now use.
[363:31.60]This is a shitload now that I want to try.
[363:34.38]Especially with this new, incredibly better scaled.
[363:38.43]And I'm going to go upgrade it again.
[363:39.51]So here we go.
[363:41.95]First slot.
[363:45.47]Swift Glintstone is good.
[363:48.88]It's good just to kind of like... Oh, I got Comet now.
[364:03.92]That takes a whole fucking mana bar.
[364:08.65]That takes so much mana.
[364:17.01]I wonder how much damage that actually does.
[364:19.40]Alright, but anyways, I think Swift, Glintstone, Shard is good for just aggro.
[364:26.56]It's good for chip damage.
[364:29.10]I'll do Comet after that.
[364:34.80]And where are the other ones?
[364:36.14]Okay, there's Eternal Darkness.
[364:45.75]Forbidden Sorcery.
[364:47.91]Creates a space of darkness that draws in sorceries and incantations.
[364:50.77]The sorcery can be cast while in motion.
[364:52.37]Okay.
[364:54.89]I got another one, too.
[364:55.67]Where is it?
[364:56.03]There it is.
[364:58.95]Night Comet.
[365:01.82]Fires a semi-invisible magic comet.
[365:04.34]The sorcery can be cast repeatedly.
[365:05.98]Okay.
[365:10.18]Collapsing Stars is another one.
[365:14.28]And then...
[365:16.86]What else?
[365:18.58]Magic downpour?
[365:19.32]No.
[365:21.02]Crystal release.
[365:22.70]Crystal release.
[365:26.28]Okay, let's check these out.
[365:27.00]Alright.
[365:41.45]That's awful.
[365:53.76]I can't move during this.
[365:57.86]That's... You have to stand completely still.
[366:02.92]Okay, what about... I gotta know... Eternal Darkness.
[366:07.38]Whoa.
[366:09.30]What does this do?
[366:15.70]I only have one active.
[366:17.56]Wait, this sucks up sorceries?
[366:21.38]So I could literally just sit here and cast.
[366:23.48]Okay, that's actually good to have on the bar.
[366:26.84]Night Comet.
[366:34.57]What's the difference between that and regular Comet?
[366:40.79]That looks good.
[366:42.37]I like the way that one looks.
[366:46.89]Stealthier.
[366:55.81]Not enough seeds.
[367:04.09]It absorbs spells.
[367:06.22]It's harder to see in PvP.
[367:08.80]This thing actually looks pretty insane.
[367:13.42]I wonder how much damage that does.
[367:14.98]We gotta test it on somebody.
[367:16.18]That one looks good.
[367:21.93]Comet with 60 plus intelligence and you never would have to melee anything again.
[367:29.63]Yeah, but the problem with that is I need way more mana.
[367:32.49]Let's test it on this person.
[367:36.17]I don't know if that was me hurting him or if he fell and he literally did that little damage to his body.
[367:50.83]Well, that's fucking dog shit.
[367:59.05]Did I just stagger him though?
[368:08.22]Oh, I upgraded it.
[368:10.34]This is more than the other one is.
[368:11.86]Hold on.
[368:17.23]It's probably this enemy type.
[368:19.83]Yeah.
[368:27.45]Try on some normal guys, yeah.
[368:30.29]It's really cheap to cast.
[368:31.38]I want to see how much Comet does.
[368:33.92]Not on these guys, because these guys are obviously beefy, bulky bozos.
[368:42.16]But I'm still going to do it.
[368:49.15]That's actually insane for how much, you know what I mean?
[368:56.77]466 damage.
[368:59.51]These guys are insanely resistant.
[369:08.04]That's big.
[369:08.90]Alright.
[369:11.64]What else do I got?
[369:15.01]This thing's cool.
[369:15.93]This is cool, but I don't think I want it.
[369:20.58]I think I keep on Loretta's Greatbow.
[369:22.24]It's been tried and true.
[369:24.44]This thing is stupid, so it's coming off.
[369:33.75]We're still barrage.
[369:34.51]I remember this.
[369:35.55]This thing was... We laughed at this.
[369:37.01]We made fun of this.
[369:43.73]I wonder if this is better with more scaling.
[369:49.81]Alright, I need to go upgrade.
[369:54.78]Big time.
[370:00.97]And I have to go check out the dragon stuff too.
[370:02.57]What time is it?
[370:05.99]How long have I been streaming for?
[370:20.00]What am I missing?
[370:20.68]I probably need some more.
[370:21.57]Yeah, I need Smithing Stone 5 for this.
[370:25.45]I don't think the giant sells 5.
[370:28.59]I have to go get him, find him somewhere.
[370:34.11]This goes to S scaling after this.
[370:35.87]I mean, that's a huge fucking deal.
[370:39.89]S scaling.
[370:45.24]Uh, I'm gonna P. I'll be back.
[370:49.62]We'll figure this out.
[370:51.10]ERB.
[370:52.64]In three minutes.
[370:53.04]I'm gonna get some water.
[374:42.79]Thank you.
[376:09.53]Okay.
[376:12.43]How are you?
[376:12.87]How you doing?
[376:14.53]Good?
[376:14.67]Good.
[376:19.16]You gone?
[376:19.54]Uh, I need to figure out where to get... Somber... Smithing Stone 5.
[376:28.44]Oh, I didn't have any music.
[376:33.83]Shit.
[376:33.93]Oops.
[376:37.01]Oops.
[376:50.81]Did you beat the big boss in the desert?
[376:52.65]Are you talking about Rodan?
[376:53.85]Because I did.
[376:56.79]He was horrible.
[377:05.88]Alright.
[377:10.02]Let's come back now.
[377:11.12]I think we're going to have to...
[377:33.00]I don't know.
[377:37.52]I need smithing stones.
[377:41.02]I could also probably do with another sacred tear or two.
[377:44.38]And another flask.
[377:51.39]And that seems, that's alright, but.
[377:52.89]Alright, I have no more love warts.
[378:03.92]Okay.
[378:08.06]So, what are we doing?
[378:11.75]I got the coin.
[378:13.69]Where is that grand lift?
[378:18.03]That's what I want to do now.
[378:19.65]No, I don't.
[378:20.11]I want to see what this is.
[378:20.93]I'm going to do that.
[378:26.95]North Lirinia?
[378:27.65]I want to see what that does.
[378:29.91]I spent a lot of time getting it.
[378:33.36]First of all, we're going that way.
[378:39.36]Hmm.
[378:44.13]That swamp outside Celia.
[378:46.87]Yep.
[378:48.71]Let me do this first, though.
[378:55.03]This thing's really... World-shaking.
[379:05.90]Yeah, in there.
[379:06.48]Oh, but that's a gigantic pot.
[379:13.59]That pot's, in fact, as big as a building, so you guys must be thrilled right now.
[379:26.84]Sky shot.
[379:34.56]Ah.
[379:43.94]Oh, I gotta go around.
[379:54.59]Haven't been here.
[379:55.23]Excuse me.
[380:06.92]I gotta go all the way around, dude.
[380:08.52]Come on, really?
[380:09.28]This is gonna kill me, isn't it?
[380:13.38]Oh, come on!
[380:14.50]Look out!
[380:14.96]That's not that far!
[380:27.75]Alright, where's the fastest fucking way to get over there?
[380:41.42]I don't know.
[380:42.08]Probably from here.
[380:47.25]That was so far.
[380:48.25]No, it's not.
[380:49.15]It's not that far.
[380:49.97]It's not.
[380:53.21]It's not far.
[380:57.17]I don't want to hear it.
[381:04.88]What if you fell from that far?
[381:06.04]I'm not a magical baby, okay?
[381:09.92]If I was a magical baby, I don't think I would die if I fell from that far.
[381:38.14]No, I'm not.
[381:39.12]Sorry.
[381:39.60]Contrary to popular belief, I'm not a magical baby.
[381:46.22]Now we go this way.
[381:47.06]And then from here... I have to keep this in mind because I gotta go around, but... Where's a safe place I can go around?
[382:00.55]That way.
[382:02.13]No?
[382:04.59]What's the best way to get over there from here?
[382:13.49]It's a magical baby.
[382:20.96]That would have been bad.
[382:29.98]Alright, I see a dungeon down there and I want to go look at it.
[382:33.73]So I'm gonna.
[382:37.23]Big war machine things.
[382:42.83]This is just a boss.
[382:47.87]No, no, I want a bonfire.
[382:49.11]What happened here?
[382:51.95]I want a bonfire.
[382:57.41]What the fuck?
[382:59.83]Why am I like a rodent?
[383:01.39]Get... What the... Hold on.
[383:11.47]Oi!
[383:43.98]Oh my god!
[383:45.04]Press the right button for once in your life!
[383:56.31]700 fucking damage?
[383:59.99]That was crazy.
[384:01.15]Alright, Comet is good.
[384:03.51]Very good.
[384:07.29]Comet is very, very good.
[384:11.49]I need a bonfire here.
[384:12.89]There's gotta be one right here somewhere.
[384:25.42]There's one.
[384:44.78]Anything looks good compared to Crystal Barrage.
[384:47.90]I mean, I think Comet really is just a fantastic move, though.
[384:50.97]Always has been.
[384:54.09]I want to go in that dungeon.
[384:55.45]But... Probably need to level up one more time.
[384:58.62]But... See if I can do it.
[385:00.56]But...
[385:34.18]Explore a little bit.
[385:35.52]Let's check and see.
[385:36.36]I do want to level up one more time.
[385:46.12]What the fuck?
[385:56.72]What was that?
[385:58.97]Oh, it's these guys.
[386:11.48]Shut up.
[386:13.30]Alright, it's time for the baby rattle to really show us why I got it in the first place.
[386:31.12]Not bad.
[386:41.92]I think that's it for here.
[386:47.32]That's sick.
[386:47.82]Yeah, I know it is.
[386:56.09]That's some sick shit.
[386:57.13]You're right.
[386:57.73]It's very cool.
[386:59.71]It's a really good ambush weapon.
[387:06.52]Oh!
[387:07.76]Look what the internet taught me.
[387:28.40]31,000 damage.
[387:34.26]The guide told him that.
[387:35.46]No, I saw a gif.
[387:40.85]I've been avoiding everything Elden Ring, but I saw this gif.
[387:44.90]I was like, that was fucking cool.
[387:46.98]That was a pretty sick gif.
[387:48.98]It wasn't a gif in the guide.
[387:50.68]There's no guide.
[387:56.16]It's fun to do that, though.
[387:57.44]Alright.
[387:58.79]It's cool to do this.
[388:01.47]Y'all know it.
[388:03.69]Like that spin.
[388:04.59]I think that pretty much wraps it up.
[388:10.63]I need...
[388:19.79]I'll go down and there's probably something cool down there.
[388:34.85]There's so many of them!
[388:45.95]I'm only getting 25 souls for each one of these idiots.
[388:48.50]It's not even worth doing.
[388:54.12]That was... That was like 30 people that I just killed.
[388:55.88]Alright, I need to find a little space to level up.
[389:09.77]There we go.
[389:16.67]dungeon here uh was it just a boss though it looked like just a boss door or am I stupid and misremembering the thing that I just looked at it looked like a boss door
[389:40.23]not a hard boss so what you're saying is I should just get in here and kill this thing and this shouldn't be a big problem and I I it's probably pretty easy boss alright so I gotta prove myself here then what are you saying I got 35 000 uh souls on the line and I gotta prove that I don't I'm not just like a katana crotch andy that's what you're saying
[390:06.97]Okay, I get it.
[390:09.21]I can see how you could think that.
[390:18.89]Yeah, I can see that.
[390:20.81]I can understand that criticism.
[390:22.63]Alright, fine.
[390:25.43]I'll go do it right now.
[390:39.23]I'll go do it right now.
[391:06.24]Let's go!
[391:07.16]What an opener!
[391:19.19]That was like the fight to you.
[391:21.97]This is like the baby rattle fight.
[391:26.17]That was actually the baby rattle fight.
[391:29.58]That was like the item to bring here.
[391:41.92]Oh my god.
[391:55.11]Some bronze shield depicted in the face of a Fire Giant.
[391:57.67]Several tongues leap from its open mouth.
[392:05.35]Tongues of fire?
[392:08.85]Really?
[392:09.15]Holy shit, this thing is big.
[392:17.24]This thing is irritatingly large.
[392:31.08]This thing's a dud!
[392:31.81]I'm too weak.
[392:41.35]Oh.
[392:44.63]That's a crazy item.
[392:47.60]That's what I use?
[392:51.28]That's the best parry shield in the game.
[392:52.92]Yeah.
[393:00.64]Can I two-hand it?
[393:06.36]Try.
[393:18.25]Still doesn't work!
[393:22.35]Imagine how shit you could have a playthrough be if I mean like I know it's like funny and shit But wow how unbearable would this be?
[393:41.63]I can't use it I know people do it though people do shield
[393:48.72]They upgrade the fuck out of the shield, and I mean it doesn't- I mean that's bad, but it probably scales okay.
[393:56.34]See the people running around with two shields?
[394:03.73]Like this?
[394:06.81]I remember this strat.
[394:08.53]People used to do this shit.
[394:11.63]He's like, okay buddy.
[394:19.42]Having a good time?
[394:26.88]Looks like I'm trying to make myself a makeshift 1910 flying machine.
[394:31.96]That's what this looks like.
[394:35.70]I've got like the big puffy airbag.
[394:38.06]I've got aerodynamic head.
[394:40.35]I've got weird shit on my back like a sail and wings.
[394:43.99]This is the 1910.
[394:46.09]We have to get somebody in a personal flying machine.
[394:52.85]okay that's very cool that was cool alright now I just need to level up a little bit let's get the comet out what do you say the 1910 cotton candy build
[395:27.25]It's got splash damage on it too, which is crazy.
[395:33.63]What is that thing?
[395:52.62]Get it away from me.
[395:59.96]Brattle can't be good.
[396:00.92]I can't believe it.
[396:01.48]This is fucked.
[396:03.20]Well, you better believe it, because it's actually not a bad item.
[396:07.06]Alright, what was the goal?
[396:12.04]The goal was to get to this building up here, right?
[396:15.97]I gotta focus.
[396:17.15]I have to level up, but still, I gotta focus on what the hell I was doing.
[396:23.89]Are you...
[396:28.33]Oh my god.
[396:29.25]Oh my god.
[396:30.40]Oh my god.
[396:31.70]I'm dead.
[396:34.58]I saw that come from a mile away and I didn't do anything about it.
[396:37.76]I just like, I stood there.
[396:40.98]I was just sitting there looking at him.
[396:43.90]In my mind, it was, there's no way he's going to come this far.
[396:46.78]There's no way he's going to come all the way over here.
[396:52.26]He just kept his head down like this and just dragged it on the ground across what seemed to be the entire game.
[397:18.42]That makes such a funny sound.
[397:21.87]Alright, stop fucking around and just leave.
[397:24.25]I don't even need to be- He just hit his friend.
[397:27.19]Do I even have to level up yet?
[398:13.01]I'm sick of you.
[398:14.01]Why is there fire everywhere?
[398:21.69]Who's shooting the fire?
[398:25.75]Dude, you can double it up.
[398:26.89]Did you see that?
[398:29.88]So you can go charge it, wham, wham, and that's 1,300, 1,400 damage at least.
[398:33.88]It's actually insane.
[398:37.32]Okay, cool.
[398:39.02]I need more intelligence, and I need to get this thing leveled up so it scales better.
[398:48.63]It looked like Scrappy-Doo in the Scooby-Doo movie where they get all fucked up from the souls.
[398:54.15]I don't know.
[398:54.67]That's very specific.
[398:55.63]I don't think I know what you mean.
[398:56.55]I don't know what that means.
[399:11.29]I think I have enough.
[399:13.53]Even if I don't.
[399:17.26]The one with Mr. Bean?
[399:24.82]You know what we're doing?
[399:25.44]We're doing sorcery again.
[399:26.28]We're doing intelligence again.
[399:29.63]I'm getting this shit to 50 intelligence before I do anything else.
[399:33.09]Alright.
[399:38.43]Now, the plan was I was going to go there.
[399:42.33]So that's what I'm going to do.
[399:46.46]need mind alright the next time I get like two or three points it's a lot of it's going to mine
[400:10.87]There's really another one right here.
[400:16.76]Mine gets better as you level it up, I think.
[400:22.50]Basically the opposite of all the other stats.
[400:24.38]Really?
[400:34.04]There is one of these trees over here, too.
[400:36.90]Aren't they usually like a weird tree boss?
[400:39.12]Well...
[400:44.54]Thank you.
[401:25.68]Stop it!
[401:26.46]Just get out of here!
[401:32.88]I was doing something.
[401:46.54]Great sword.
[401:47.36]Just a regular great sword.
[401:48.58]Eh.
[401:51.92]I mean, it has to be in the game, right?
[401:57.70]So I have a question for all of you souls fanatics.
[402:03.25]Is there a reason to use a great sword like that when all these other wacky fucking items in the game exist?
[402:23.10]Force Iron Lump of Ultra Greatsword.
[402:30.38]Oh, this is the Guts Sword.
[402:32.04]Yeah.
[402:34.46]Because, I mean, like, but... If you... I mean, it's cool.
[402:40.38]But, if... I feel like there's so many... There's tons of interesting weapons.
[402:46.29]It's almost hard to justify using just a regular weapon.
[402:49.98]Like for instance, is anybody just using a longsword?
[402:54.16]Just like this?
[402:59.64]Like who's using like the dagger?
[403:04.20]I'm just, yeah, I'm using the just dagger.
[403:06.90]It's the regular dagger.
[403:08.78]Is it?
[403:10.06]So many cool things, it's hard to justify you.
[403:11.92]And they're probably fine.
[403:12.94]They probably scale really well.
[403:14.94]It's like, holy shit.
[403:15.95]The scorpion stinger.
[403:18.21]The reduvia.
[403:19.75]The miserecorde.
[403:21.13]Like, there's so much cool shit.
[403:25.13]Oh, I'm going to use the S-Dock.
[403:27.15]Are you?
[403:28.48]Because, like, there's so much other crazy shit in the game.
[403:35.52]You can swap out blade arts on normal weapons.
[403:37.77]Okay, so that's a big deal.
[403:40.65]That's a big deal.
[403:43.89]That justifies a lot of reasons to use it.
[403:45.91]Because you can put whatever you want on it.
[403:47.35]Okay, alright, that makes sense.
[403:49.85]That's, okay, I get it.
[403:55.88]Blade art plus infusion.
[403:57.50]That's true.
[403:58.18]Yep, okay, yep, you're right.
[404:00.50]I stand completely corrected, you're right.
[404:07.59]But there's going to be one of those bosses here, right?
[404:09.23]Isn't there always one of those weird tree death root or something?
[404:21.08]I think there is, yeah.
[404:30.75]Go find out.
[404:46.30]Hmm.
[404:51.80]Another dungeon.
[404:56.13]Point me into the direction of the dungeon.
[404:59.93]Oh, interesting.
[405:00.99]Is the dungeon down there?
[405:05.11]I gotta go down that way anyways, so let's go.
[405:08.09]Okay, that's how you get down there.
[405:22.79]Is that a church?
[405:29.67]Is that an NPC?
[405:46.37]Oh, fuck it.
[405:48.63]Alright, let's go.
[405:54.57]That is a church.
[405:55.19]Alright, I'll get a tear from this.
[405:56.11]Why does this place look so weird?
[406:09.54]Smoldering church.
[406:14.48]There's a cookbook.
[406:16.01]And another cookbook.
[406:21.23]Is there no secretary here?
[406:24.90]Usually there's a tier, right?
[406:26.96]Where's the tier?
[406:41.64]No tier?
[406:47.54]What kind of church is this?
[406:55.90]What kind of church is this?
[406:57.04]There's no tear.
[407:17.14]Can I already look at this?
[407:17.84]It's the guts, right?
[407:22.53]Invaded by Anastasia Tarnished-Eater.
[407:25.57]Where are they?
[407:28.17]Oh.
[407:29.39]Did you look at you?
[407:29.97]Oh, fuck.
[407:46.86]Ooh, that hurts you a lot, doesn't it?
[407:53.54]Easy.
[408:01.77]Sacred Scorpion Charm.
[408:07.94]Lord Godfrey, at last, at the end of his campaign, his golden armies, unvanquished and unbowed, it finds Grace lost, tattered, and faded.
[408:18.49]Talisman.
[408:24.68]Raises holy attack.
[408:26.24]Ah, that's not me.
[408:29.92]That's not me.
[408:32.06]But I'm surprised there's no sacred tear in there.
[408:36.30]I need to go down that tree.
[408:51.25]You just beat that poor man's ass.
[408:52.95]Yes, I did.
[408:55.46]Yes, I did.
[408:56.12]Very much so.
[408:56.74]Okay, where was the way to get down there?
[409:07.78]This way.
[409:12.08]There's only a couple exceptions.
[409:13.38]Usually they're in the churches of Marika.
[409:15.16]Okay.
[409:20.95]Well, there's a boss.
[409:24.18]I'm not going to fight that while the enemy is surrounding me.
[409:30.20]Fucking surrounded by idiots.
[409:35.73]Alright.
[409:36.67]You know what I'm doing.
[409:37.53]You know the time.
[409:38.29]Fuck off.
[409:56.48]What the fuck do you guys keep coming from stage left and stage right?
[410:01.10]Where do you people keep coming from?
[410:02.35]There's somebody just constantly behind me.
[410:07.87]Stop!
[410:15.42]Alright.
[410:16.22]What do you got?
[410:16.74]Who's this?
[410:26.50]Earth Tree, Avatar.
[410:27.32]Not bad.
[410:32.67]Way better.
[410:38.13]Way better.
[411:16.25]Hello!
[411:27.58]Fuck!
[411:47.39]I didn't know that they- that she was- Look, they just blew up the fucking round.
[411:52.33]You know what?
[411:57.35]Fuck the horse.
[412:00.79]Baby time!
[412:02.21]Fuck.
[412:20.78]What are you doing?
[412:21.34]Why is there so much rot everywhere?
[412:31.38]Why is there so much shit everywhere?
[412:32.58]Why am I rotted?
[412:35.84]What?
[412:36.12]Okay.
[412:46.97]Holy damage and rot damage.
[412:49.75]Okay, please.
[412:52.81]I mean, I'm gonna destroy this thing.
[412:53.77]Get the fuck over here.
[413:26.75]Get this fucking puke off me.
[413:33.29]It's a pot.
[413:33.89]It broke the pot.
[413:34.63]It broke the pot.
[413:35.35]Okay, it breaks the pot.
[413:36.52]I didn't know it was gonna break the pot.
[413:37.70]Okay.
[413:58.02]Maybe Rattle is not bad.
[413:59.98]It's really not.
[414:01.52]Talked a lot of shit about it, but it actually is pretty good.
[414:05.98]That move is the only reason to have it on.
[414:08.40]It's pretty easy to predict.
[414:14.54]Ooh.
[414:17.02]So, okay, it's one, two, three, four.
[414:21.34]It takes a while, but if you get an opportunity...
[414:24.16]Okay, if it didn't have the first hit, this weapon, literally throw it into the ocean.
[414:29.36]Right?
[414:30.42]The first hit makes this worth having.
[414:38.87]It's slow, but it's good.
[414:39.79]Yeah.
[414:40.69]If it didn't have that first hit, it'd be terrible.
[414:45.48]Okay, cool.
[414:47.62]May have been a little over-leveled for this one, but I haven't been here.
[414:53.36]Very curious about what that is.
[414:57.72]It's flask.
[414:58.40]I didn't even know it existed until fucking halfway through the goddamn game.
[415:03.45]Where is that flask shit?
[415:05.21]Okay.
[415:09.15]Rarely boost stamina recovery speed.
[415:10.63]Rarely boost stamina.
[415:12.86]So stamina or stamina recovery speed.
[415:14.72]Boost fire attack.
[415:19.54]I gotta go to all these trees because I guarantee it is like an intelligence one or like a magic one.
[415:31.38]The arrow keeps pointing this way still.
[415:40.91]There it is.
[415:42.49]Okay, so here's the dungeon.
[415:46.55]I'll get off my horse.
[415:47.17]We'll do this.
[415:53.21]Minor Ur-Tree Catacombs.
[415:56.85]It's one that gives you unlimited FP.
[416:04.75]That would be insane.
[416:14.18]I have to imagine I could probably just come in here and clean up, because... Although, I mean, this is not... This is pretty early, okay?
[416:21.37]If I were to, from Limgrave, go up, you know, like three days ago, I may have come across this area.
[416:29.77]So, I'm probably a little over-leveled for this stuff, but it's free shit, and I want it.
[416:52.88]Is this rot?
[416:54.36]It is.
[417:02.99]Oh, those things are rot on the ground.
[417:11.86]Hey.
[417:12.44]You know what we're gonna do, boys and girls?
[417:34.25]Very good.
[417:35.51]Okay, so... Why is it still building?
[417:37.79]What's... Why is it still building?
[417:39.04]I'm not even standing in it.
[417:40.00]What was that?
[417:40.46]Huh?
[417:42.58]I'm not even... Why is it building?
[417:50.36]Why is it building?
[417:51.24]I'm not standing over here.
[417:52.14]How do I go up from here?
[417:55.44]How do I go up?
[418:17.72]Can I go up?
[418:21.46]Soap doesn't do anything.
[418:26.82]I don't see a way to go up.
[418:30.33]I don't know.
[418:32.65]Am I insane?
[418:35.51]No, there's no... Maybe back up the elevator?
[418:41.27]There's no way to go here.
[418:51.84]Coming all the way down the elevator for what?
[418:53.60]For that?
[418:54.84]Oh no, right here.
[419:15.81]Don't!
[419:16.65]I can't die in here.
[419:17.39]That would be embarrassing.
[419:30.23]Even if you're over leveled for an area, Imp Cat Head.
[419:38.12]Whoa, this thing's awesome.
[419:43.74]Oh, it's Trace Amount of Intelligence?
[419:46.76]Wait.
[419:55.84]I lose one intelligence, but that's so much more defense.
[420:00.30]Cat baby.
[420:07.11]Is that worth taking off the intelligence?
[420:08.73]I mean, I'm... So much more immunity, robustness.
[420:14.89]Maybe it's worth just putting on, keeping on.
[420:18.13]This is the worst outfit.
[420:20.82]I feel like I came out of the trash.
[420:28.02]I look like, like dumpster melted action figure baby.
[420:37.33]Like this is an action figure that you melted and threw it away.
[420:40.91]Just dumpster.
[420:44.13]Dumpster action figure.
[420:49.06]Forked greatsword.
[420:57.59]This is an Action League Now character.
[420:59.69]This is a Rick and Morty joke.
[421:12.16]Or, or, okay, the costume for every horror movie, villain.
[421:18.08]From, like, 2000, like, 2, forward.
[421:26.49]Every, like, scary person outfit.
[421:37.81]Every door is open.
[421:43.90]I kinda like it, though.
[421:45.16]I'm a little too dirty.
[421:49.98]I think I'm gonna alter this and take the bib off.
[421:55.31]I think I've got my character.
[421:56.31]Okay, heavy door opened.
[422:11.34]It's like burnt yucky skin, dude.
[422:13.06]What did you expect?
[422:18.14]Um, where was the heavy door after?
[422:26.91]Or a heavy door.
[422:32.91]No?
[422:35.99]Is there a heavy door down there?
[422:42.95]Let me... Oh, I'm gonna alter this.
[422:43.87]Let me see what it looks like.
[422:44.67]Aww.
[422:51.23]I can't take the weird, gross skin off of
[422:55.16]Really?
[422:55.40]I have to keep the growth skin on?
[423:37.46]I don't want to go through this.
[423:40.24]Do I have any more of those anti-rot things?
[423:47.36]Okay, first time crafting ever.
[423:49.62]Time to make some.
[423:52.09]Scarlet Rot.
[423:53.01]Make seven of them.
[423:56.85]Okay, I have seven.
[424:08.61]I need to eat soap.
[424:11.49]Okay.
[424:16.09]Let's go.
[424:23.40]Okay, there's a way to go this way.
[424:26.72]This character makes so much noise now with this baby rattle.
[424:40.01]Oh, no.
[424:42.15]Rabs.
[424:43.83]Oh, shit.
[424:44.35]I just... What's up here?
[425:18.93]You're not real!
[425:35.99]Excuse me.
[425:39.65]What?
[425:40.03]I can be a wolf head?
[425:41.75]This is endurance.
[425:50.34]Endurance and okay, so you can do endurance or intelligence It's kind of more like an alligator than it is a wolf I think I'd be a wolf
[426:16.25]Sacramento Bud.
[426:17.17]This place is kind of big.
[426:19.45]There's a ton more down there.
[426:21.03]Uh, that's just the beginning of the dungeon, right?
[426:30.86]Yeah.
[426:32.32]Right?
[426:32.76]I think so.
[426:34.64]Beginning of the jungle.
[426:41.16]He looks like Alf.
[426:44.39]It did kind of look like Alf.
[426:52.17]It was Alf.
[427:01.83]I don't know.
[427:02.87]Better keep the cat away from me.
[427:04.36]I'll eat the cat.
[427:05.34]That guy fucking ate cats.
[427:07.72]Right?
[427:08.20]Like, that's kind of weird now, thinking about that, like 25 years later.
[427:13.91]I'm gonna eat your cat!
[427:14.97]Like, you're gonna eat the cat of the household, like our pet?
[427:20.64]He was always talking about like eating their cat.
[427:24.14]Like, Alf.
[427:25.56]Fuck off.
[427:26.50]You live here for free.
[427:27.90]You stay in here for free.
[427:29.70]We feed you.
[427:30.38]You don't have to do anything.
[427:31.92]You run like a weird like ham radio fucking station out of the basement.
[427:36.47]You're not eating Mr. Fluffy.
[427:38.17]It's not gonna happen.
[427:49.73]Boomer show, can't relate, plus old.
[427:52.01]Eh, maybe one day you'll binge it on Netflix.
[427:56.25]If it ever goes there.
[428:02.98]Dated reference, all those references are dated.
[428:05.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[428:07.27]Sorry, sorry, I'm 36.
[428:19.53]Sorry I'm 36.
[428:21.14]I remember Al.
[428:53.56]Is there a boss down here, or what?
[428:56.26]There is, and that's a long run, so I better be able to one-shot Andy.
[428:59.34]I better be able to one-shot Andy this, because it's probably a very easy encounter.
[429:03.26]Don't say that, because if you lose, you're going to look like an idiot.
[429:05.14]It's two of those cats.
[429:15.31]Oh shit!
[429:17.05]Oh my god, I did so much damage.
[429:22.40]Hey, let's watch.
[429:25.08]What do you guys say?
[429:26.90]You want to watch?
[429:30.32]Let's watch.
[429:31.26]Alright, don't... Okay, let's watch.
[429:48.89]Go get him!
[429:53.77]Come on, baby!
[429:54.53]He's plus eight.
[429:59.61]He better be good.
[430:18.21]Do something!
[430:19.03]He's drinking a potion!
[430:24.85]Is he alright?
[430:25.45]He might do it.
[430:29.11]No, you can do it.
[430:30.15]Come on.
[430:32.07]Drink another potion.
[430:32.79]Drink another potion.
[430:33.67]Another potion.
[430:34.17]You got another one.
[430:35.07]Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[430:36.83]Drink.
[430:38.62]What is he doing?
[430:39.32]That's the worst move in the game.
[430:42.26]That's the worst move in the game.
[430:47.80]so so so so so
[431:34.41]Fuck off!
[431:56.94]Mad pumpkin head ashes.
[431:58.26]Okay, that's kind of cool Mimic has your genes.
[432:03.54]I'm sorry.
[432:04.04]I would not cast collapsing star at this enemy
[432:12.30]He was just sitting there getting pummeled.
[432:14.50]His brain couldn't figure out what to do.
[432:17.78]Discharge R2 does so much damage.
[432:19.32]Yeah.
[432:20.66]This thing is actually good.
[432:22.12]We just been... We gave this way too much shit because the katana is just like a broken, unbelievable weapon.
[432:27.93]It's the best weapon probably in the whole game.
[432:29.71]So everything else by comparison is like, wow, that thing sucks.
[432:32.07]But no, this thing's actually really good.
[432:36.17]If you can get this down...
[432:40.42]Especially during boss encounters, it's like 1200 plus to 1500 damage when you do it.
[432:49.23]This thing's really cool.
[432:52.69]Like 8 out of 10 PvPers are using that katana.
[433:00.50]Yeah, I mean that, holy shit.
[433:03.54]I like it.
[433:04.42]I think it's actually really cool.
[433:05.50]I think it's fun.
[433:07.06]It's really cool looking.
[433:07.86]Alright, so now that I did that.
[433:11.03]Let's head back to the entrance.
[433:17.36]Striking damage, yeah.
[433:18.12]That's what I'm saying.
[433:19.50]If you can get both... If you hit the... That part... And the explosion will just... Is an extra.
[433:31.25]Especially when I... And you know what?
[433:35.19]Alright.
[433:43.05]Alright.
[433:44.77]Decision has been made.
[433:59.64]Let's go.
[434:13.72]Plus 10.
[434:13.98]Or plus 9.
[434:19.46]I think this thing, this is going to carry us.
[434:32.41]Stake?
[434:32.87]I don't think so.
[434:33.69]Because I honestly think that that left trigger is... Arguably... Arguably better...
[434:43.90]and the katana's uh l2 for one reason because it gives you more than one opportunity to hit it this is a one trick andy weapon that's fine this is going to scale well within it's already doing as much damage right now as the katana
[435:10.26]I'm going to stick with my decision to get the baby rattle to plus 10.
[435:23.79]Let's do a little bit of an examination here.
[435:25.53]179, 189.
[435:26.55]We're at... Where can I see this?
[435:29.93]Okay. 553...
[435:42.51]545.
[435:42.53]This has bleed.
[435:46.85]It does.
[435:47.55]Which makes it ridiculous.
[435:48.83]But... This is starting to fall off with magic scaling.
[435:55.44]If both B and C... This would be like 580 maybe.
[435:59.46]With plus 9.
[435:59.90]You can compare it.
[436:04.89]Okay, here we go.
[436:07.23]So...
[436:16.92]Why is it lower B?
[436:19.87]Is it a lower B?
[436:20.67]Is it like a B minus?
[436:23.95]Is it a plus 10?
[436:24.47]No, it's a plus 9.
[436:26.75]Plus 9 versus plus 8.
[436:31.95]Oh, it's because of... Yeah, right.
[436:34.14]I mean, this is obviously a better weapon, right?
[436:37.06]Let's be obvious.
[436:39.26]But I think this thing is going to really shine somewhere.
[436:51.49]Okay.
[436:52.39]What time is it?
[436:52.87]We're getting close.
[436:58.04]We're getting close to the end of the stream.
[437:03.36]Not quite yet.
[437:04.50]I want to do a couple more things.
[437:08.12]I didn't even go to the area that I wanted to go to.
[437:12.69]Why is this marked?
[437:13.55]No.
[437:13.99]I wanted to do this.
[437:17.67]Yeah.
[437:18.23]I want to go to this urn tree.
[437:19.17]Okay.
[437:24.87]Because I want to do that painting thing.
[437:35.82]So I need to go... I need to go this way.
[437:40.82]Actually, just mark it.
[437:48.83]I want to see the painting.
[437:55.51]And there's probably an Urge Tree Avatar that I didn't do here.
[438:03.79]You don't die if you do this, right?
[438:04.75]I thought you didn't.
[438:06.97]You jumped into those things.
[438:09.74]I thought you didn't if you jumped into the wind thing.
[438:12.20]Like, if you jumped down into it?
[438:16.36]Really?
[438:16.62]I missed.
[438:19.82]I wasn't close enough.
[438:25.68]Oh, well, I made it.
[438:39.20]What is... What's with all the pots?
[438:41.35]There's so many of them.
[438:48.83]But that's accurate though, right?
[438:50.29]If I land in that, I don't get... That's accurate, right?
[439:04.93]Okay, yeah.
[439:05.53]I just thought I was losing my mind for a second.
[439:07.83]Alright.
[439:11.90]Go.
[439:12.14]Go.
[439:34.17]Ooh, very putrid.
[439:35.37]Too putrid.
[439:36.05]Holy shit!
[439:38.85]Okay, well not, uh... I think we were on the horse for this one.
[439:50.97]This seems like a horse one.
[440:14.50]That's it for this video.
[440:26.97]Thanks for watching.
[441:07.81]What?! !
[441:34.36]Alright, watch out for this.
[441:35.30]Holy shit.
[441:43.02]Holy shit.
[442:16.28]Get that rod out of here!
[442:52.49]Alright.
[443:06.82]Again?
[443:15.02]Friendship.
[443:15.78]Friendship.
[443:16.72]Again.
[443:19.61]Yikes.
[443:20.69]Go.
[443:46.43]Not a third swing?
[443:55.64]I'm fucking paranoid.
[444:08.97]There is a third swing.
[444:42.32]You kill it by hitting it.
[444:46.34]You don't... There's no time limit.
[444:49.90]100,000 souls.
[444:50.42]What are you doing?
[444:55.82]There's no time limit to beating a boss in Elden Ring.
[445:01.41]You want me to get in there and act like an idiot?
[445:03.51]And go too overconfident and hit him like five times?
[445:06.01]Wrap around and hit him five times and get killed?
[445:07.73]No.
[445:08.73]No.
[445:11.22]That's a lot of souls.
[445:12.14]Okay.
[445:15.16]What do those do?
[445:21.41]Okay.
[445:24.97]Makes attacks more likely to break enemy stances.
[445:27.69]That's really good.
[445:31.85]Rarely boosts all damage negation.
[445:38.77]Uh.
[445:46.67]So this is like this.
[445:48.19]This takes one hit.
[445:50.91]This is temporary for a while.
[445:52.65]This one's kind of cool, but I feel like this would be actually the meta.
[446:03.88]Something tells me you drink this before a boss fight.
[446:05.64]You go fight a boss and you'll be breaking this dance every five seconds.
[446:12.07]I was hoping for a magic one, but that's not what we got.
[446:16.56]Let me go see the painting.
[446:21.24]Alright, this is it right here.
[446:22.52]This is it.
[446:26.62]I'm too high.
[446:42.61]Down there?
[446:42.99]I got a hundred thousand souls dude.
[446:50.12]I got a hundred thousand souls.
[447:24.63]Is that it right there?
[447:25.23]That's it right there.
[447:27.22]Is it safe to go down here?
[447:34.24]That's literally it right there.
[447:35.97]Right there.
[447:36.35]I don't know how safe this is to go down this way.
[447:42.13]I might have to go to that.
[447:52.49]Can I drop right here?
[447:59.79]Please, God.
[448:03.47]Please teleport.
[448:04.77]Mark it and come back, please.
[448:15.62]Alright, fine.
[448:42.32]I'm gonna get into 50 and then we're doing Mind and Vigor the rest of the game.
[448:51.94]I actually might.
[448:53.30]No.
[449:06.92]Alright, I want to do that.
[449:08.12]That looks really cool.
[449:10.45]That's a secret, difficult parkour to get to this little thing and there's a teleporter there.
[449:17.45]You bet your ass I'm going to go do that right now.
[449:30.94]Oh, right.
[449:32.54]I can just do that.
[449:38.31]Let's go.
[449:41.61]Right here.
[449:49.45]Wait, what was it?
[449:50.19]Where was it?
[449:50.83]Like right here, right?
[449:56.14]Where was that?
[450:01.38]Wait, where was that?
[450:07.20]Oh, right there.
[450:07.68]Okay.
[450:30.71]Get off the horse.
[450:32.30]I can't get off the horse.
[451:05.66]I didn't want to fall through the middle.
[451:07.96]Nice aim.
[451:10.96]The one... The one spot that I couldn't do that on is where I fucking didn't.
[451:21.88]Way too cautious.
[451:24.68]Fuck.
[451:32.24]At least it wasn't 100,000.
[451:32.72]No, it wasn't.
[451:45.13]Alright, I'm not hesitating.
[451:46.07]Let's go.
[451:46.57]Where even are the souls?
[451:47.87]Are the souls down here?
[451:52.89]Oh, they're... Okay.
[452:00.00]They're there.
[452:03.72]Oh!
[452:04.40]They're there.
[452:04.88]What?! !
[452:15.79]What happened there?
[452:16.47]What was wrong with that?
[452:21.71]What happened there?
[452:22.61]I gotta land on the branch?
[452:38.91]What kind of fucked up masochistic sadist
[452:45.57]Made it so you had to land on the branch and not the pillar.
[452:49.83]Otherwise you die.
[452:51.19]What kind of... sadistic... fucking masochistic... Where am I going?
[453:14.57]Honestly, what the fuck am I doing?
[453:16.33]Where am I going?
[453:22.86]There's a bonfire down here.
[453:23.86]Don't jump.
[453:24.62]Are you fucking out of your mind?
[453:35.12]I didn't get this bonfire?
[453:45.56]I guess not.
[453:55.61]Well, that would have made this a million times easier.
[454:08.13]Alright, so now I gotta go to this... Alzheimer's.
[454:12.96]I...
[454:18.29]What is my goal?
[454:19.17]My goal is there's a very, very big, deep, super large, on sale, valuable secret.
[454:27.52]That's down here.
[454:28.30]I just have to get it.
[454:32.04]I just have to get there.
[454:32.90]There's a very super valuable, interesting secret.
[454:42.43]Super cool.
[454:43.13]And it's not this way.
[454:46.25]It's over here.
[454:49.30]Watch and learn.
[454:49.93]I'm so mad!
[455:21.59]I know, and that's not like, oh, watch and learn.
[455:23.39]Here's a funny clip.
[455:27.07]I am not going to do Cordo... No, get out of there.
[455:29.98]Get out of there.
[455:30.36]I'm too old for that.
[455:31.44]I'm fucking 36 years old, man.
[455:32.96]I'm not going to start doing, like, Cordolio.
[455:36.14]Way too old.
[455:37.38]I'm too old for that.
[455:39.24]Actually too old for that.
[455:41.84]Okay, like a decade later, I would have looked at that clip of me being like, I am Cornholio!
[455:49.05]And I would have been like, fucking come on, dude.
[455:52.49]I just walked off the edge.
[455:58.33]I can't do Cornholio.
[456:01.83]Mm-mm.
[456:02.72]Mm-mm.
[456:04.40]Mm-mm.
[456:05.78]No.
[456:29.12]Don't go up this one.
[456:30.56]I want to go on that branch.
[456:39.29]I'm sliding.
[456:43.25]Get this shit out of the way.
[456:44.19]Okay, where from here?
[456:46.97]Right there.
[456:51.45]Okay.
[456:52.75]I did it.
[456:53.95]I think I actually did it.
[456:58.21]That branch right there.
[457:02.37]Don't fucking die.
[457:03.57]FUCK!
[457:29.35]I am Cordolio.
[457:37.16]I can't wait for this to be just a Smithing Stone.
[457:39.28]You know what?
[457:41.54]You're probably right.
[457:43.84]It's probably a Somber Smithing Stone 4.
[457:47.83]But I'll be damned if I'm not going to do this.
[457:51.67]I'm going to get to the bottom of that.
[457:53.51]I'm going to do it.
[458:23.17]Don't overshoot it.
[458:23.77]I got it.
[458:27.89]Let's go.
[458:29.37]Fuck yeah.
[458:36.73]What's up here?
[458:51.88]Cracked a plot.
[458:55.13]That's an enemy That's an enemy Why is there an enemy here?
[459:23.88]It's a fucking ruined arc.
[459:31.08]What the fuck?!
[459:36.36]Go off the cliff!
[459:51.38]What is this guy?
[459:53.22]Why is this dude a Steven Spielberg?
[459:55.38]That guy, did somebody die?
[459:57.98]What happened?
[459:58.36]Did he kill that guy?
[460:01.38]What just happened?
[460:04.14]Why was that guy doing like a Steven Spielberg thing?
[460:07.88]I think he killed that thing.
[460:30.13]Don't even fucking do that.
[460:51.13]Fuck you!
[461:15.11]Break his legs!
[461:30.58]Maybe it's the sword.
[461:31.80]No, it's his arms.
[461:33.68]It's the arms.
[462:04.37]I want to kill that guy.
[462:08.39]I'll try one more thing.

[464:39.55]You don't have to jump.

[480:58.78]No matter what has ever happened in my life, you have always been there for me.
[481:05.67]No matter what has ever happened in my entire life, you have always been, like, this guy doesn't know me at all.

[481:48.86]I don't know about anything, whatever's happened in my life.
[481:53.76]It's so funny.
[481:54.68]They used to charge for this.
[481:57.87]I remember watching the ads on TV and it was the funniest fucking thing.
[482:15.55]I know you know this, but I want to say it again.
[482:20.08]I'm so glad we're friends.
[482:22.06]That's the other one.
[482:23.38]That's the other one.
[482:25.51]He leans in really close to the microphone.
[482:31.08]No matter what has ever happened in my life... Where's the double jump?
[482:35.04]Fuck you!
[482:35.74]I'm done.
[482:36.54]I'm done.
[482:36.84]I'm done.

[482:37.60]And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever... Where was the double jump?
[482:41.24]I would have got under there.
[482:42.16]You saw that.
[482:42.96]Where was the double jump?
[482:44.70]I would have nailed that.
[482:45.90]Where was the double jump?
[482:50.97]We're here for you.
[482:54.47]We believe in you.
[482:58.12]I'm so glad we're friends.

[483:46.83]I don't need the horse.
[483:48.93]Fuck it.
[483:51.98]I know you know this, but I want to say it again.

[484:14.01]And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever receive.
[484:17.75]The greatest gift anyone could ever give.
[484:19.70]You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know.
[484:28.22]Look up love in the dictionary, and there's your picture.
[484:43.58]No, you don't.
[484:45.78]Thank you, my friend.
[484:58.91]He's flying the wrong way, you piece of shit!
[485:16.00]YOU FUCKING LOCKED ME IN!
[485:52.54]Congratulations.
[485:53.82]You did it.
[485:55.61]You didn't let anyone or anything stop you.
[485:58.49]I didn't actually.
[485:59.33]All your hard work has paid off.
[486:01.53]I actually didn't do it.
[486:02.61]You knew where you were headed and you kept walking a straight line toward that goal.
[486:08.09]You took the obstacles and made them rungs on a ladder.
[486:11.89]And now success is yours.
[486:17.46]And it's all because of your commitment to yourself.
[486:20.10]You've earned it.
[486:21.20]You deserve it.
[486:23.51]Feels good, doesn't it?
[486:25.25]I didn't win yet.
[486:26.71]Success is yours!
[486:41.82]Thank you.
[486:42.94]Thank you for believing in me.
[486:45.46]Thank you for a million things.
[486:48.68]for your love and your support and your persistence and your patience and your courage.
[486:54.77]When life was the craziest, when I didn't have a clue who I was, when I kept going down the wrong road, you were always there.
[487:09.10]And you never gave up hope.
[487:10.52]You never said good luck or on your own.
[487:13.12]You never walked away.
[487:14.52]You stood nearby.
[487:16.50]And you prayed your prayers and you knew the truth.
[487:20.63]And it worked!
[487:22.71]I wouldn't be who I am today if it were not for you.
[487:32.75]And together...
[487:42.46]Do a move!
[488:00.82]Here it goes!
[488:17.82]What, he fell over again?
[488:18.90]Listen, listen up.
[488:36.80]All this is for you.
[488:47.59]But it is.
[488:49.27]So don't give up.
[488:50.23]You're almost there.
[488:51.83]You can have what you want.
[488:58.33]You can do it.
[488:59.55]Don't stop now.
[489:00.87]Just keep going.
[489:02.73]The finish line is closer than you think.
[489:05.84]We can see it.
[489:10.14]Hear that?
[489:12.00]It's your turn.
[489:18.77]Take it in.
[489:20.01]Take it in.
[489:21.55]It's your turn!
[489:31.08]Drop his ass!
[489:37.34]Holy shit, the rocks can hit you.
[489:38.96]I thought it was a cosmetic.
[490:05.58]To you the glass is always more than half full.
[490:27.04]You're smart, and you're creative, and you're courageous.
[490:34.45]You tell the truth.
[490:35.89]You stand up for what you believe.
[490:38.17]You learn from your mistakes.
[490:40.03]And you laugh easily, often at yourself.
[490:45.26]You're a good friend and you've got good friends.
[490:51.68]You have passion.
[490:53.06]You love life.
[490:55.26]And when you dream, you inspire others to dream.

[491:55.16]Please!
[491:56.46]Fire block this thing!
[491:59.06]Fine.
[492:03.28]Oh my god, I thought that was the other one.
[492:11.23]Oh my god, he killed me in one hit.
[492:13.09]He killed me in one fucking hit.
[492:14.45]He killed me in one fucking hit.
[492:15.79]He killed me in one hit.
[492:16.73]He killed me in one hit.
[492:17.59]I thought I got under his legs.
[492:19.54]I didn't... I don't know how he hit me with that.
[492:21.76]I was between his legs.
[492:25.21]I was between his legs, wasn't I?
[492:27.27]The fucking axe didn't even touch me.
[492:28.59]The thing didn't even fucking touch me.
[492:31.41]What the fuck?
[492:32.05]Fuck you.
[492:32.75]What?
[492:34.09]No.
[492:34.81]No.
[492:35.83]No way.
[492:37.82]No way.
[492:38.82]No way.
[492:40.06]No way.
[492:40.64]There's a blade on the hilt?
[492:46.80]No!
[492:47.58]No way!
[492:48.64]No way!
[492:49.49]Alright, fuck this guy.
[492:53.95]No way!
[492:58.11]How?
[492:59.01]I was- I was literally in between his fucking legs!
[493:01.49]I'm pissed.
[493:12.14]You weren't completely healed.
[493:19.11]So it did 97.5% of my HP.
[493:25.60]You've got to be fucking kidding me!
[493:27.16]That's so fucking annoying!
[493:55.15]Time for the meat grinder.
[493:56.47]There's time... I... Like... What the fuck?
[494:05.65]I could... I couldn't stagger... You can only stagger, it seems, with this... Alright.
[494:18.28]I can't fucking believe he killed me in one hit.
[494:23.64]I'm gonna run away.
[494:27.26]That would have been such a great end, too.
[494:29.86]You annoying little fuck.
[494:37.58]Couldn't stagger him.
[495:19.07]I wouldn't- I would be very mad if he didn't, like... I... fucking can't believe it.
[495:31.82]That's why I was so desperately trying to keep at full health, too, because, like, god damn it, man.
[495:36.60]That- the fucking move, and it's just... I- I want to look at that clip, because I want to see how I got hit.
[495:46.51]on doom music fuck this enemy he's gonna drop he's gonna drop a smoldering butterfly but I'm gonna shove this sword down his throat and just twist it around in a circle I I fucking hate this guy sucks he's in a shit area he's got instant fucking kill moves it's got he's got one hit kill moves I don't care who you want
[496:31.90]Before I go again.
[496:33.50]People are saying hit his legs.
[496:36.10]I don't think it staggers him.
[496:37.26]It only staggers where the smoldering molten is, right?
[496:41.36]It's like you have to break the smoldering stuff.
[496:52.65]You can.
[496:53.21]You can do his legs.
[496:55.90]You can stagger anywhere.
[497:02.91]This version, he has his legs covered.
[497:08.66]No legs, don't.
[497:09.64]No, no, no.
[497:10.06]You have to do the arms.
[497:12.12]You don't have to do the arms.
[497:14.42]It staggers, but it's weaker.
[497:15.52]His wrist is weak, yeah.
[497:21.79]Whatever.
[497:22.11]How loud is this going to be?
[497:29.20]No, I want like a from the first age, from the first dagger, from the first blood.
[497:36.50]There it is.
[497:39.90]Gonna be loud.
[497:40.66]Gonna be loud.
[497:41.86]Warning.
[497:42.14]Gonna be loud.
[497:46.09]I'm not kidding.
[498:03.08]What?
[498:33.44]I can't support that.
[500:08.34]I don't know.
[500:34.91]I don't know what I'm doing.
[501:04.23]Fuck you.
[501:18.31]Music, get the music pumping.
[501:20.09]What's with this lull moment?
[501:31.59]Come on.
[501:46.91]Get it!
[501:47.35]Get it!
[502:39.00]I tried to dodge the second one, it's okay.
[503:13.69]My right trigger, my right trigger got fucking stuck, I swear to god I'm not making that up.
[503:17.74]I swear to god.
[503:56.37]What's happening?
[503:57.01]Why does that keep happening?
[504:15.19]Oh.
[504:15.33]My.
[504:15.45]Fucking.
[504:15.87]I'm dead.
[504:16.99]It's over.
[504:18.32]It's bad news.
[504:29.54]My right trigger's fucked.
[504:48.90]What the fuck?
[505:05.34]Did I break my controller?
[505:06.30]I got the Golem's Halberd.
[505:13.86]I think it was just really sweaty, and I was slipping on it.
[505:19.29]It seems overly sensitive right now, though.
[505:21.29]Like, literally, look at this.
[505:22.17]Really, like... Like... It's weird.
[505:31.85]Alright, nice.
[505:33.63]It was nothing.
[505:41.25]What?
[505:41.72]I already had one of those.
[506:15.85]Yeah, just right here.
[506:18.55]Oh, dude, but I can do dual wielding.
[506:36.60]That was not worth doing at all.
[506:41.53]There's no reason to kill that guy.
[506:46.47]There's actually no reason to kill them.
[506:50.30]Unless you want to... That was cool.
[506:59.29]That was kind of cool.
[507:03.11]Alright, so is there anything else here?
[507:14.89]Yeah, but now you're the one person that killed that guy.
[507:19.28]Am I?
[507:19.48]How come he's not achieving for it?
[507:21.68]I got the spell, yeah.
[507:24.94]There's nothing else here.
[507:25.62]How do I... Teleport.
[507:28.16]I'm not going to put a magical, gigantic, giant golem over there and not have something be cool that drops a giant golem magic sword.
[507:37.06]Alright, well, what did I get?
[507:39.54]Yeah, I...
[507:43.74]I'm not streaming for the next couple days, so... We're gonna keep going.
[507:57.13]Not for long.
[507:57.81]Not for long.
[507:58.37]Not for long.
[507:58.89]Not for long.
[508:01.71]Only like 20 to 30... Look at how red I am.
[508:06.88]Only like 20 to 30 minutes tops.
[508:09.87]There's something I... I want to go to that pot.
[508:12.81]I'll forget about it.
[508:13.55]The one that I was going to do before.
[508:15.09]This is my voice.
[508:16.19]Holy shit, I'm all fucked up.
[508:19.98]Okay, it's an Ash of War.
[508:24.92]Grants, affinities, and skills.
[508:27.38]Reign of Arrows.
[508:32.81]Archery skill.

[508:36.11]This is the bows.
[508:41.38]not seen any of these yet okay uh I want to do oh we can take that I want to do this
[509:09.67]From here, probably.
[509:10.57]How do I get there?
[509:11.39]I forget.
[509:11.79]I think it's from here.
[509:13.71]Over here.
[509:22.46]Okay, because I got to go down to that way.
[509:30.90]Okay, I'm going this way.
[509:32.76]Let's go.
[509:35.42]Got to go to Sea Offer River.
[509:38.80]The Gargoyle Locked Elevator.
[509:40.06]Is that the place for my notes?
[509:44.11]The offer has a stone sword key elevator.
[509:46.15]Is that what it is?
[509:46.71]Whoopsie.
[509:55.95]Look at that guy.
[510:07.35]That was crazy.
[510:08.07]I'm not fighting that one.
[510:11.53]The elevator is required.
[510:13.85]Looks like I can get here from here.
[510:15.71]No, I can't.
[510:29.34]Did I do this tree?
[510:30.42]Yeah, I think I did, right?
[510:34.20]Did I do this tree?
[510:36.36]Yeah.
[510:40.33]You can jump up the crystal, but it's probably not intended.
[510:42.56]Alright.
[510:47.92]I have tons of those keys.
[510:48.82]I'll do it.
[510:49.14]Go through the swamp.
[510:52.10]There's an exit to the north.
[510:53.70]Oh, shit.
[510:59.15]I can't get there if you're over this way.
[511:09.81]I have like 12 of those keys.
[511:11.25]I'll do it.
[511:16.86]Okay.
[511:36.94]Let's see where this goes.
[511:40.92]This game looks so pretty.
[511:41.92]It is pretty.
[511:46.71]This is going to take me up.
[511:48.95]I'm going to be inside that building.
[511:50.52]Okay.
[512:12.37]A long elevator.
[512:13.17]Okay.
[512:28.04]Ah.
[512:29.98]Very, very interesting.
[512:31.16]Okay, so this is how you have to get here.
[512:32.76]And there's one of those things over there.
[512:34.14]We're just going to investigate this line here and then I'm done.
[512:42.54]And then we're going to figure out what to do with this game going forward.
[512:45.56]I'm going to play Mario Golf.
[512:48.26]I don't know which one.
[512:49.08]I don't know which one do you want me to play.
[512:50.90]Which one do you want?

[513:59.10]He just shot himself.

[514:22.90]Oh, he didn't.

[516:57.31]Alright, I actually have to let go.
[517:04.51]I gotta get up tomorrow.
[517:07.75]This is it.
[517:26.11]How do I move him?
[517:28.57]I need to go to 6 AM Mass.
[517:30.23]No.
[517:32.39]That is not what I'm doing.
[517:33.55]What do I do?
[517:35.33]I'm back.
[518:01.99]Someone's on the ground?
[518:13.85]There are summoning signs.
[518:16.16]Well... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[518:22.02]I'm out of gas.
[518:25.07]Oh, shit.
[518:25.53]These... Okay.
[518:27.03]These are red.
[518:30.08]Knight of the Great Jar.
[518:33.62]And... Wait.
[518:38.65]I'm running Adversary.
[518:39.63]I don't get it.
[518:45.25]Okay.
[519:25.27]What's this fucking camera?
[519:31.73]Wrong move.
[519:35.57]Okay, like, that just fucked me up so bad.
[519:37.89]I'm like, why are we stuck?
[519:38.93]I, like, was moving my...
[519:41.55]I had the wrong spell equipped.
[519:42.71]Like, I could have beat that guy in literally fucking five seconds.
[519:51.42]It's not bad time.
[519:51.98]No, no, no.
[519:52.94]Oh my god, that's far away.
[520:00.14]One more.
[520:04.26]And, like, the weird invisible wall that was behind me, that just threw me off.
[520:07.87]And then, like, I had this... Like, I don't even know why it's on my loadout.
[520:11.19]I don't even know why three of these are on my loadout.
[520:12.93]What's the point?
[520:20.41]Let me just kill it.
[520:22.42]Just kill it, please.
[520:25.26]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[520:27.40]I'm not streaming tomorrow, and I'm not streaming for, like, a couple days.
[520:31.55]And I'm gonna play Mario Golf for like 30 minutes to like just to like do something else so people don't think I'm like a fucking one game Andy.
[520:38.60]And then I'm literally gonna play this game.
[520:46.22]We're gonna open the menu of Mario Golf and I'm gonna do my settings and then I'm gonna go back in Elden Ring.
[521:00.78]Okay.
[521:04.43]Where are those signs?
[521:08.07]Right here?
[521:13.32]No.
[521:14.40]Yeah.
[521:22.99]That's not going to be bad, is it?
[521:32.13]That's what I deserve.
[521:53.66]Ooh, nice guard counter!
[521:56.51]so so
[522:28.08]Alright.
[522:32.99]You happy?
[522:35.55]Are you happy?
[522:40.23]Duelist Knight of the Great Jar has died.
[522:41.87]Are you happy?
[522:43.12]You gonna let me in now?
[522:53.29]You got to kill them all, don't you?
[522:56.27]Of course you do.
[523:23.40]Oh, fuck.
[523:23.86]Alright, I'm being greedy.
[523:24.56]Stop being greedy.
[523:25.16]Stop being greedy.
[523:26.54]Actually, stop being greedy and play.
[523:51.03]Okay.
[523:55.12]We're at three.
[524:07.24]Last one.
[524:14.30]This guy looks to be the strongest of the three.
[524:16.78]We'll find out.
[524:20.53]No cheese.
[524:21.19]I'm wasting time.
[524:22.51]Don't attack yet.
[524:23.15]That's a lot of swords.
[524:45.65]Don't use magic.
[524:46.37]Don't use magic.
[524:47.07]Don't use magic.
[524:50.90]No time.
[525:17.54]I jumped over his fucking head?
[525:31.45]He actually hit me.
[525:32.25]Fuck you.
[525:44.41]He's getting closer.
[525:45.27]Gravity Well!
[525:53.92]Whatever this is.
[525:57.36]I'm dead.
[525:57.86]Fuck.
[526:00.05]Heal?
[526:00.37]I don't have any heals left.
[526:16.86]I'm fighting him first.
[526:28.95]The Eternal Darkness is a good idea.
[526:30.37]I just...got it.
[526:34.95]We're going 1, 3, 2 because the second guy is the easiest.
[526:46.53]Dude, get that shit out of here.
[527:05.81]You're a righteous little shit.
[527:19.82]Okay.
[527:21.44]One, three, two.
[527:31.27]I'm gonna get Eternal Darkness ready.
[527:37.61]It should absorb the spells.
[527:50.14]Actually fucking amazing.
[527:56.42]I was too busy marveling at how cool that spell was that I'm gonna die.
[528:13.35]Damn it.
[528:13.69]It's like it's them all the buttons you have to press to fucking do it.
[528:16.28]I just got to keep them Thanks empty Oh
[528:38.76]This guy's really on that much pain in the ass, but the tank is literally on empty.
[528:43.56]This guy is the fucking worst of the three without a doubt.
[529:03.20]He just has so much shit to do.
[529:19.81]He's like five times faster than me and has... I don't know.
[529:31.09]This guy is the fucking worst.
[529:32.35]The other two, like, literally just go home.
[529:34.07]Like, why would you... What's the point of having the other two guys home?
[529:38.06]You are... You are not even close to being as good as this guy is.
[529:41.64]Like, not even close.
[529:43.15]Not even fucking close.
[529:45.07]Both of you go home.
[529:46.29]Oh, don't come back either.
[529:48.08]He doesn't- We don't need three bodyguards.
[529:49.68]We have this guy.
[529:50.43]We have- We have Dualist.
[529:52.69]It's not his- Alright, it's time for bed.
[530:00.31]His name is... Dualist.
[530:03.11]Right.
[530:04.18]Not Dualist.
[530:07.18]Not Dualist.
[530:09.14]He's a dentist!
[530:13.88]I made it up for fucking content.
[530:15.14]Relax.
[530:16.99]Let's go.
[530:51.61]I think this guy is just the hardest of the three.
[531:01.72]Use the katana?
[531:04.20]I feel like the katana is cheating at this point.
[531:09.58]Alright, I'm done.
[531:10.80]I'm done.
[531:11.32]I'm done.
[531:11.66]I'm done.
[531:11.96]I'm done.
[531:12.31]I'm done.
[531:12.71]I'm done.
[531:13.11]It's over.
[531:13.87]It's over.
[531:14.35]It's over.
[531:21.60]It's ending in precisely 60 seconds.
[531:28.18]One.
[531:33.26]No, no, no, don't count yet.
[532:00.65]Okay, they just doubled at the same time.
[532:07.44]Sure.
[532:12.94]Alright, we gotta get a confidence boost fight.
[532:15.77]Confidence boost fight, that's this guy right here.
[532:17.89]Confidence boost fight, bring him up.
[532:27.06]This guy's a piece of shit.
[532:28.04]He's a chump.
[532:29.10]He's awful at everything.
[532:30.14]He's not very good.
[532:31.52]And I'm going to get a backstab right now.
[532:32.68]Three, two, one.
[532:33.34]I can't reason with this fucking thing with these idiots.
[532:52.31]Please.
[532:54.96]Oh, I would normally dodge that.
[532:56.94]Oh, I have to unplug the fucking ethernet.
[533:02.28]I would normally dodge that without a problem at all.
[533:04.10]I gotta unplug the ethernet cable.
[533:08.44]Look at how sloppy these dodges are.
[533:11.80]This is bad.
[533:12.90]This is ugly.
[533:23.58]There's no way I missed that in any other scenario.
[533:31.32]There's no way I missed that in any other scenario.
[533:43.10]Alright, we gotta summon the fucking Great Gatsby, whatever this guy's name is.
[533:49.88]I will say though, I'm really glad that I fixed the internet thing.
[534:03.86]It was the server.
[534:04.82]It was the Twitch server.
[534:10.09]Unfortunately, it is.
[534:11.21]I don't know what that means, though.
[534:14.87]Because... The server that I normally stream on, I don't have any fucking mana.
[534:26.20]Really?
[534:27.96]That was greedy.
[534:30.02]But I'm gonna get you killed.
[534:39.93]This will though.
[534:43.79]Okay.
[534:55.85]Alright, so what I was going to say was I've been streaming on a server for like two years and I can't stream to it anymore.
[535:08.31]I don't know what happened.
[535:11.05]Alright.
[535:20.48]Just dodge and swing and attack.
[535:24.19]Forget about dealing with the black hole thing.
[535:26.51]That doesn't matter.
[535:27.23]Just kill him.
[536:01.71]Yes!
[536:35.20]Let me in!
[536:42.56]Greatjar's arsenal?
[536:43.70]Is that it?
[536:53.73]That can't be it.
[537:06.96]Max equipment load.
[537:08.12]Can I get in now?
[537:21.39]Oh.
[537:22.07]Did he move out of the way?
[537:22.93]I'm supposed to just start smacking him.
[537:30.55]Really?
[537:30.79]I can't get in here?
[537:33.95]Well, I'll have to figure this out another time.
[537:42.55]Pretty cool, though.
[537:51.40]Looks interesting over there.
[537:52.24]Alright.
[537:56.24]Pretty cool.
[537:56.98]There might be something else I can do there, but I am going to just go back to the town.
[538:02.17]We're going to do one quick little thing to wrap it up.
[538:04.47]Actually, I'm going to put the credits on the screen.
[538:11.89]That makes sense, right?
[538:13.21]Doesn't it?
[538:19.84]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[538:20.68]Appreciate it.
[538:27.60]I'll see you guys.
[538:30.48]I will see you guys.
[538:31.58]Oh, that needs to go down here.
[538:40.35]I'll see you guys in two days.
[538:44.08]So, Monday, Tuesday.
[538:45.20]I'll see you guys on Wednesday for Mario.
[538:48.96]I'll see you guys for Mario.
[538:53.45]Mario Golf.
[539:08.25]It's like a little face cam.
[539:10.37]I'll see you guys at Mario Golf, and then... This is me talking.
[539:13.05]I can't even speak.
[539:17.32]Well, that'd be technically three days, but it technically is the next day right now.
[539:26.10]It is technically Sunday.
[539:29.32]That would be three days, technically.
[539:31.50]Right?
[539:31.70]Two and a half?
[539:32.36]Whatever it is.
[539:40.46]Thanks for all the subs.
[539:41.16]There were a lot.
[539:41.62]There was a couple of major gifted subs.
[539:45.02]Thanks, guys.
[539:45.42]Appreciate it.
[539:46.94]I still can't upgrade this.
[539:48.22]I can't upgrade.
[539:48.70]I need a five, which I don't know where I can even get one.
[539:52.44]Let's figure that out in a few days.
[539:55.46]But it's awesome.
[539:56.58]I'm having a bunch of fun.
[539:57.46]I haven't done really any of the main campaign stuff, really.
[540:00.15]Besides, obviously, the Rena stuff, which was really difficult.
[540:06.35]I'll see you from Mario Golf.
[540:13.94]Thanks for watching.
[540:24.26]Sunday.
[540:25.22]Wait.
[540:25.94]Sunday.
[540:26.54]Oh, shit.
[540:27.44]Yeah, you're right.
[540:28.16]That's true.
[540:28.59]That would be three days.
[540:29.65]Right.
[540:29.85]Because it is the next day.
[540:31.93]So, yeah.
[540:32.15]I'll see you Tuesday.
[540:34.09]I mean, yeah.
[540:34.65]Right, right, right.
[540:35.19]My brain was just trying to figure that out.
[540:36.49]Because the day is already here.
[540:38.41]Right, right, right, right, right.
[540:40.62]I'll see you guys on Tuesday the 8th at 4 p.m.
[540:45.24]Pacific.
[540:49.57]Yeah, I meant it to be two days, not three days.
[540:52.85]See you guys on Tuesday.
[540:55.71]Mario Golf and probably more Elden Ring.
[541:00.91]Great evening.
[541:02.03]Great night.
[541:03.25]Thanks for watching.
[541:04.69]Bye.
[541:05.61]Good night.
[541:06.65]Take care.
[541:09.91]Take care of yourselves.
[541:13.25]Uh, raid.
[541:14.39]Who's even live right now?
[541:22.36]How many, who's even live?
[541:31.26]Uh, let's see.
[541:38.61]Pray Bob Ross.
[541:52.60]Let's see.
[541:53.02]There's a few people I could do it to.
[542:09.13]No, not Bob Ross.
[542:10.23]I'm not going to raid Bob Ross.
[542:27.46]Just go to bed.
[542:28.28]Chat, go raid whoever Atelum Jerm has sent you.
[542:36.59]XQC is live, yeah.
[542:39.37]BoxBox is live.
[542:41.25]Um... MoonMoon is live.
[542:44.53]I don't... You know what?
[542:45.53]Just spread out.
[542:46.17]I don't know how to do this, too.
[542:48.83]And I got... I am fucking dead, and I need to leave now.
[542:54.46]Does everybody just spread in five or six different directions?
[542:59.44]Some of you go to BoxBox, some of you go to XQC, some of you go to MoonMoon, some of you... Wherever you want to go.
[543:07.23]Just scatter.
[543:09.67]Iron Mouse is doing, yeah, the sub-a-thon, so... Yeah, there's a lot of places to go.
[543:15.98]I just can't decide.
[543:16.86]I can't pick.
[543:18.40]I'm too tired.
[543:20.58]Good night.
[543:21.86]We'll do a proper... We'll raid somebody proper next time.
[543:30.29]Good night, guys.
[543:32.63]Remind me to do a proper raid.
[543:36.81]Tuesday at 4 o'clock.
[543:37.89]That's correct, Pacific.
[543:39.30]See you soon.
[543:40.64]Good night, guys.
