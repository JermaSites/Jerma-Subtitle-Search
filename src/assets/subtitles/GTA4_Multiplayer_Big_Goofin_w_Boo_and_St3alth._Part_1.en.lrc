[00:09.84]Hey!
[00:11.52]Head and run.
[00:12.06]Don't you stab me.
[00:13.14]Dude, did you just kill that guy and I killed you at the same time?
[00:19.21]Yeah, I had to make sure that all... Alright, Boo, what are you doing?
[00:22.87]I'm being stealthy.
[00:23.87]There's a cop there.
[00:25.97]Oh, God.
[00:27.79]Oh.
[00:31.05]Alright, let's... Alright, get it... Alright, we... Get all these people out of their cars.
[00:34.67]We're gonna make a barricade.
[00:37.98]Hold on, I think I... Am I wedged in between these two things?
[00:42.57]Okay, uh, never mind.
[00:44.17]Get out of the car.
[00:45.55]And go get another one.
[00:46.43]So, it was just... Hold on, is there already a police barricade right here?
[00:52.01]What are you... I'm having a hard time figuring out how to... Alright, get out of the car.
[00:57.93]Get out of your cars.
[00:58.47]We're gonna make it... Get behind... Oh, my God.
[01:01.33]Get behind... Everyone get behind the cars.
[01:04.01]We don't have guns.
[01:04.69]We have, like, pistols.
[01:06.13]Attack.
[01:06.55]I have a sauna.
[01:08.11]I just got destroyed.
[01:10.47]Make a barricade with the cars so the police, like, can't get to us.
[01:13.89]So line them up.
[01:15.31]Line them up like dominoes.
[01:17.71]Okay.
[01:17.99]You see where I am?
[01:18.69]See on the mini-map where I am?
[01:19.55]Ow.
[01:20.11]I have car.
[01:20.61]Who's this dead guy?
[01:21.63]I just, I shot that guy in his face.
[01:23.75]He was being annoying.
[01:25.53]Alright, well, get out of the way!
[01:27.11]I'm gonna, like... You didn't shoot this person.
[01:29.85]Dude!
[01:32.36]Hey!
[01:34.68]Alright, so line them up like... Line them up like an army of cars.
[01:38.32]There we go.
[01:39.39]Yeah, alright, we're good, good.
[01:40.57]And instant three stars for shooting a cop in the head.
[01:43.57]She was headbutting.
[01:44.57]Alright, we just need... Once we get in the middle here, we can really start to... This is where it gets crazy.
[01:51.33]Oh my god, I've just found a fucking striker shotgun.
[01:54.08]I'm not even kidding.
[01:55.96]Keep it, because we're going to need it.
[01:58.46]It's like a... Oh my god.
[02:00.88]Ow.
[02:02.68]Alright, alright.
[02:03.38]Everyone get in between.
[02:04.85]Get in between so we don't get in trouble here.
[02:06.63]What kind of parking was that?
[02:07.69]Oh hey, by the way, the hit... What is it?
[02:10.31]How do you get, like, next to the car?
[02:11.45]Hey, hey, what are you doing?
[02:12.23]I'm trying to use that.
[02:14.19]I'm trying to use that, you idiot!
[02:17.65]Oh my god, there's so many enemies.
[02:19.51]Alright, let's do it.
[02:20.41]Oh my gosh.
[02:22.53]I got shot.
[02:22.87]What?
[02:23.01]How did I die?
[02:28.44]Wait, the bullets went through the car?
[02:30.34]Look at all these freaking cops.
[02:32.71]Oh, no, it's this guy with the shotgun.
[02:36.53]Oh, stealth.
[02:37.47]A shotgun behind you.
[02:39.11]That asshole with the shotgun is dead.
[02:41.27]There's like five cops right here.
[02:46.46]Are you serious?
[02:53.25]They're killing me so quickly.
[02:54.84]No, we gotta get in an alleyway.
[02:57.20]Can you auto-aim?
[02:58.12]I'm kicking their ass.
[02:59.28]Can you auto-aim?
[02:59.90]How do you get behind cover?
[03:01.86]Hey, baby.
[03:04.20]You looking to go for a ride, sweetheart?
[03:06.94]Dude, don't shoot the... Oh, my God.
[03:09.56]Look at this mess of cars.
[03:15.46]Get in.
[03:16.38]Get in the car.
[03:17.76]Get in.
[03:18.40]Calm down.
[03:22.57]Oh, this guy is not happy.
[03:23.69]Look at that mess.
[03:24.73]Oh, my God.
[03:26.99]Oh, the music.
[03:28.03]Oh my gosh.
[03:28.91]Hey, thanks for blowing out the tires.
[03:30.21]That, like, really helped.
[03:31.71]That really helped our escape.
[03:32.77]Alright, boo again.
[03:35.73]You want me to get this two-seater?
[03:37.85]Oh, is there?
[03:38.69]No, there's no.
[03:39.27]You can get in the back.
[03:40.59]How do I turn the radio off?
[03:41.77]There's no off?
[03:42.62]Alright, let's go.
[03:44.32]Oh, so we're gonna do drive-bys in this piece of shit?
[03:47.40]Oh, by the way, you can thank MLC_St3alth for shooting out the tires for fun.
[03:51.94]I can't even drive this damn car.
[03:53.86]Hey guys, I have a story to tell you.
[03:56.56]You ever hear the one about the guy that... Oh my god.
[04:03.91]I jumped out too.
[04:05.85]Yeah, thanks.
[04:06.39]We can ditch that stupid car.
[04:10.07]That's like playing Battlefield where they just ditch a helicopter midair.
[04:14.43]We can get six to out somebody.
[04:16.57]Stealth, did you shoot the damn tire out?
[04:18.31]Yeah.
[04:19.35]Oh, you son of a... I did that the second you were about to get in my car.
[04:24.89]Oh, my God.
[04:26.13]What is with you?
[04:26.89]Don't shoot the tires.
[04:27.83]We need them.
[04:28.77]I thought I shot both of them.
[04:29.87]Only that one.
[04:31.03]Alright.
[04:31.53]New plan.
[04:32.23]Can I shoot the tire from right here?
[04:33.29]I don't know.
[04:35.23]Oh, that poor guy.
[04:37.30]Oh, grandma.
[04:38.18]Alright.
[04:39.92]Well, Stealth, you brought this on yourself.
[04:42.60]Oh, no.
[04:45.31]Oh, I would land in the water.
[04:46.73]It didn't even work!
[04:49.25]My guy jumped out the car and landed over the fence.
[04:52.06]Why did that not even work?
[04:53.18]That was stupid.
[04:54.00]Oh, jeez.
[04:55.12]Alright, that's your punishment for shooting the tires off.
[04:59.90]I had a shotgun.
[05:02.46]Alright, what have we learned today?
[05:04.13]We've learned that it's impossible to get six stars when you play with MLZ stealth.
[05:10.45]Oh, fuck.
[05:10.95]Here comes... The coppers are coming to get him, sniping him.
[05:15.11]Are you back there?
[05:15.67]Alright, good.
[05:16.59]This is actually a great spot.
[05:17.59]This is a great spot.
[05:19.27]This is a fantastic spot.
[05:25.65]This thing's automatic, my god.
[05:27.27]I hear a helicopter.
[05:28.31]Yeah, that thing shoots really fast.
[05:30.79]Oh, there's a lot of them.
[05:32.40]That's a SWAT team right there.
[05:34.26]Wow, I'm not even near you guys.
[05:35.92]I'm running.
[05:36.48]This thing's gonna explode.
[05:37.42]Run!
[05:37.84]Get off!
[05:38.36]No, why am I jumping on top of the car?
[05:41.06]No!
[05:41.24]Make a run for it!
[05:45.51]Oh, I just barely got away from that.
[05:47.55]Holy crap.
[05:50.97]I've had a grenade launcher.
[05:52.11]There's going to be plenty of guys for you to snipe here in a second.
[05:54.19]Hey, can you see those choppers up there?
[05:56.11]I can.
[05:57.05]Okay, just wait for me there.
[05:58.85]Oh, dude, I just got sniped.
[06:02.97]Oh, wait, let me get in that SWAT car too.
[06:05.51]Oh, wait, that's you.
[06:06.01]Oh, wrong button.
[06:07.25]Whoops.
[06:08.44]Alright, so let's get in the SWAT car.
[06:10.92]Yeah, if you climb in, you get body armor.
[06:12.34]Alright, I got full body armor.
[06:13.70]I can protect you guys.
[06:15.43]I can't, there's cowboys around me.
[06:16.93]I have to shoot them.
[06:17.83]Alright.
[06:19.07]This guy's like, this guy's like sandwiched.
[06:21.40]This thing's gonna blow.
[06:22.38]Hey, that thing right next to it's gonna blow.
[06:23.92]That thing's gonna explode.
[06:26.50]Run away!
[06:27.48]Run away!
[06:30.06]Oh, it's intact, it's intact, it's intact.
[06:32.86]Oh my god!
[06:37.29]Why, there's so many people here.
[06:39.17]Wanna see something cool?
[06:40.61]Yeah, I do.
[06:41.88]Okay.
[06:42.64]Feast your eyes.
[06:44.56]In 3, 2, 1... What did you just do?
[06:45.30]Oh my god!
[06:48.08]You just blew them all up!
[06:49.25]Hey, I just shot one too.
[06:50.35]They're on the left.
[06:51.59]Look at that guy!
[06:52.33]Look at that guy flying!
[06:55.95]Hold on, Jerma.
[06:59.15]Let me in.
[06:59.99]Alright, get in.
[07:00.41]I think you have to get in the back, Boo.
[07:03.15]Oh, is it still intact?
[07:04.76]Yeah, this thing's ready to go, I think.
[07:07.06]Can you get in?
[07:07.96]Oh, yeah, hell yeah.
[07:10.00]Now we are unstoppable, baby!
[07:13.47]How are we gonna kill those helicopters above us?
[07:15.95]How do you switch weapons well on this thing?
[07:18.25]I don't know.
[07:19.75]I don't wanna press buttons.
[07:20.57]You ram into them.
[07:22.09]Head on.
[07:24.99]Oh, this guy.
[07:25.55]Bad day for you, buddy.
[07:27.63]Oh, that was epic.
[07:30.10]Oh, you shoot him out of the back?
[07:31.94]Yeah, you cut right through, and I shot him up, and he kind of flipped the car.
[07:34.87]Now he's on his... Oh, he's on his back.
[07:36.83]That's unfortunate.
[07:39.09]This thing is slow as shit.
[07:42.41]I hope we see, like, I hope we railroad somebody straight ahead.
[07:45.51]This would be so funny.
[07:47.33]Oh, too bad we didn't get that guy.
[07:50.43]Alright, it's already his.
[07:51.05]We're gonna do a break.
[07:52.41]He's gonna ram right into the back of us.
[07:54.25]Oh god, he's gonna hit me.
[07:58.36]Oh, come on, you can't take all of it, Jack.
[08:00.72]Yeah, I can't, I can't, like, shoot these guys.
[08:03.76]I can only shoot if they're, like, right to my right.
[08:06.22]I wish we had, like, an ice cream truck.
[08:07.94]Oh my god.
[08:13.47]Um, you have to really piss them off for six stars, don't you?
[08:17.89]Uh, yeah, I know, really.
[08:19.39]Oh my god, we've been with five stars.
[08:20.35]Do you have any, like, grenades or any molotovs or anything?
[08:22.84]I don't know how to change guns.
[08:23.76]I have like a grenade launcher.
[08:26.34]How do you change guns?
[08:27.34]Oh, I have molotovs.
[08:28.54]What just happened?
[08:30.08]I got shot out.
[08:31.18]You got shot out of the car?
[08:32.64]Yeah, they shot me out.
[08:34.16]Oh, no.
[08:35.30]Oh, no.
[08:36.12]I've lost my molotovs.
[08:39.58]I left you for dead.
[08:40.74]What?
[08:41.56]I'm still alive.
[08:42.34]You left you for dead.
[08:43.46]That's what you did.
[08:45.52]No, I didn't.
[08:46.45]I got this cruiser now.
[08:50.36]I'm in the cruiser!
[08:51.90]Oh, no I'm not.
[08:53.18]I'm flipping over.
[08:55.10]Alright, so we're good human beings?
[08:56.28]What the hell is going on?
[08:57.35]Why is this helicopter like... Oh my god.
[08:59.79]Wow.
[08:59.99]Oh, he can't get in that.
[09:01.37]Oh, the pilot's still... Can we get inside and do nothing with it?
[09:04.39]The pilot's still in there?
[09:05.95]Yeah.
[09:06.91]Or the passenger.
[09:08.03]Oh, come on.
[09:09.42]Um... He's... I don't think it's glitched out.
[09:15.70]Hey, let me on, let me on.
[09:18.44]Alright, let's go.
[09:19.84]How do you do a wheelie?
[09:21.54]Um, just drive really fast.
[09:24.21]Into a car.
[09:27.69]Oh, yeah.
[09:29.15]Everybody's working for the weekend.
[09:48.94]I didn't even get like hurt.
