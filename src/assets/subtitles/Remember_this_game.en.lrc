[00:40.80]Hi, guys.
[00:43.28]Welcome to a secret TF2 stream.
[00:45.28]Don't tell anybody about this.
[00:47.05]It's important.
[00:50.03]I haven't played this game in a very long time, so I just wanted to check it out.
[00:54.23]See how the game was doing.
[00:55.77]I'm probably going to regret this.
[01:04.26]In fact, I may already be regretting it.
[01:12.20]Jerma's a fat man?
[01:13.08]I'm not... What?
[01:13.74]What are you talking about?
[01:17.18]I am fucking physically fit and I refuse just to believe otherwise.
[01:28.99]I know.
[01:29.43]Ronnie, what the fuck am I doing?
[01:31.89]Why am I doing this, Ronnie?
[01:34.21]What point... What purpose does this serve right now?
[01:37.85]I don't know.
[01:43.90]But we're going to play TF2 for the time being, at least.
[01:50.37]Look like I just ran a marathon.
[01:51.71]I did just get back from the gym.
[01:53.87]Well, not just get back.
[01:55.19]It's like 12.
[01:55.79]Like three hours ago I got back from the gym.
[01:58.85]And I'm one of those dirty fucks that gets back from the gym and just doesn't even care.
[02:05.96]You think I care?
[02:09.08]Am I even on camera right now?
[02:10.42]Yeah, I am.
[02:13.59]You guys get to look at me tonight.
[02:15.93]In all my sweaty fucking dog shit glory.
[02:24.54]Get some stuff situated.
[02:26.04]I forget how to play.
[02:26.64]I don't know how to play this game.
[02:28.12]I forget how to play TF2.
[02:29.48]You know what I mean?
[02:33.52]You know, you just like completely forget how to do everything in a game.
[02:36.48]That's me.
[02:37.97]We're gonna see what they added.
[02:39.13]Alright, am I like buttons still the same?
[02:47.09]Kind of Feels weird to be playing this why I'm no I'm not gonna play engineer right now.
[02:52.81]Are you serious?
[02:54.19]I'd be a really stupid idea What do I even have for items I have no idea what I even have on this character How do you change classes how do you fucking change classes in TF2 Sensitivity is all fucked up
[03:13.89]Oh, look.
[03:15.00]Look, that's me.
[03:16.48]I'm on the screen.
[03:17.34]Look at that.
[03:18.92]Look, I get to be on the TF2 screen.
[03:22.04]I forgot they added this.
[03:22.90]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[03:33.59]I like that.
[03:34.01]It feels weird watching this game be played.
[03:38.97]It feels weird opening up this game and playing it, if I'm honest with you.
[03:44.03]Alright, let me just go to mouse.
[03:48.85]I believe it was 263, if I'm not completely mistaken, which I don't think I am.
[03:55.88]No, I don't think I am.
[03:59.30]You guys ready to get back in the swing of things?
[04:00.60]Look at that rocket jump.
[04:03.26]That's how you know we're getting back.
[04:04.46]Oh, God.
[04:05.06]I have a rat at school, little honey.
[04:07.91]I will kill you just for... Just for help.
[04:13.93]Your wish is thanks so much for subscribing.
[04:16.38]Welcome to the channel.
[04:18.54]Your wish is my fucking command.
[04:24.32]I still feel like it's a little low.
[04:28.95]It's a little low, I think, still.
[04:32.75]We'll go 290.
[04:33.27]290.
[04:33.29]Should cut it, right?
[04:41.27]Alright, guys.
[04:42.11]Don't make fun of me.
[04:45.05]Who is it?
[04:47.85]Who is it?
[04:48.67]I missed it.
[04:50.11]I tried to look.
[04:52.99]Shit.
[04:53.73]I gotta, like, alt-tab in a second.
[04:55.77]I'll get you in a second, buddy.
[05:01.10]Oh, my God.
[05:01.42]I'm so used to, like... I'm so used to Overwatch.
[05:03.44]Like, your own bombs don't hurt you in Overwatch.
[05:06.14]Well, they do, but not a Junkrat's thing.
[05:08.10]You know what I'm talking about.
[05:08.80]Alright, let me see who that was.
[05:14.18]Who was it?
[05:14.52]Who was it?
[05:14.82]Who was it?
[05:18.30]Why did it not pop up?
[05:20.88]Oh, there we go.
[05:21.78]Nthrash.
[05:23.36]Welcome, Nthrash.
[05:24.16]Thank you for subscribing.
[05:25.73]Very much so.
[05:27.99]Welcome to the stream.
[05:29.37]I much appreciate it.
[05:31.55]I hope you enjoy your stay.
[05:34.31]As they say.
[05:35.35]I probably shouldn't be using the direct hit.
[05:40.14]That's probably not the greatest idea I've ever had.
[05:45.61]Still feel like it's low.
[05:53.41]Oh, I still got it.
[05:54.25]Wait, what?
[05:55.27]Still got it.
[05:56.71]Dapio, two months, man.
[05:57.89]Thanks a lot.
[05:58.33]Appreciate it.
[06:02.67]Two months in a row.
[06:08.23]No air shot.
[06:13.18]That's a crit.
[06:14.24]I'm not even using my secondaries.
[06:16.00]I'm going to start doing that, man.
[06:18.20]What are your thoughts on the game Team Fortress 2?
[06:23.58]I don't know.
[06:26.29]It's alright.
[06:28.03]It's an okay video game, I guess.
[06:29.73]If you're into that sort of thing.
[06:35.29]I want to play.
[06:35.99]Oh!
[06:41.78]Oh!
[06:43.80]Ah.
[06:45.56]Oh, you're still alive.
[06:47.86]Shit.
[06:52.09]Am I on Snapchat?
[06:53.59]I actually... Actually, I just, like, downloaded Snapchat and was just, like, taking random pictures of my face.
[07:00.21]With, like, the old clown lady.
[07:05.52]I broke the Twitch video curse?
[07:09.84]What does that mean?
[07:10.70]The Twitch video curse?
[07:17.06]You know, I think it's because I haven't, like, streamed this game in, like, two... Ah.
[07:26.73]We're okay.
[07:28.46]You suck it, Pharah.
[07:30.50]Well, that's not fair.
[07:31.24]This is the Soldier, man.
[07:35.95]Come on.
[07:36.47]Where'd he go?
[07:39.84]Give me your Snapchat later.
[07:41.21]I don't even know how to use the damn thing.
[07:43.83]I just, like, installed it.
[07:47.77]See ya.
[07:47.95]Shit.
[07:48.07]I thought he was gonna jump.
[07:58.08]Whoa.
[07:58.86]Too many people.
[08:02.82]Ah.
[08:03.10]See ya.
[08:04.08]Already you guys are giving me commands.
[08:05.68]You're giving me commands already.
[08:07.55]I just turned the stream on.
[08:12.88]Oh, hey, Maddy.
[08:14.77]Hi, Maddy.
[08:16.73]You don't remember anything about this game?
[08:17.87]Well, the only thing you need to know is that it's fantastic.
[08:20.47]That's all I need to know.
[08:23.29]Oh, let's change it up.
[08:24.33]Let's go.
[08:24.91]I'm gonna go sniper.
[08:33.35]I'm gonna be this guy.
[08:34.07]I'm gonna be that guy right now.
[08:42.98]Alright, I have pee.
[08:43.58]I forgot about the pee.
[08:47.44]Excuse me.
[08:49.02]I'm in need of medical attention.
[08:59.43]Chaos Zwi.
[09:02.03]Welcome, Chaos Zwi.
[09:02.95]Thank you for subscribing.
[09:05.41]We all love you so much.
[09:06.55]Can we get some fucking moons in the chat, please?
[09:09.79]For these new three subs that we just got.
[09:11.51]Back to back to back.
[09:18.63]Sniper's probably not the best thing to come back to.
[09:21.75]No, it definitely is not.
[09:24.50]I didn't even play Widowmaker in Overwatch, so... This is not the character I should be playing.
[09:31.58]I'm just gonna be bodyshotting the absolute hell out of people.
[09:36.99]Maybe not.
[09:39.13]Maybe not!
[09:46.46]Shit.
[09:47.32]Alright, we're going for melee.
[09:48.54]Only melee.
[09:49.32]No, we're not.
[09:49.80]No, we're not.
[09:50.14]No, we're not.
[09:50.44]We're gonna run.
[09:50.98]Run, run, run, run, run.
[09:51.63]Get away.
[09:51.91]Get away.
[09:52.17]Get away.
[09:59.01]I still love TF2.
[09:59.93]It'll never not be a great game.
[10:01.07]I just haven't wanted to play it in months.
[10:03.92]I'll be honest with you.
[10:04.68]I'm playing it right now because I can't play Overwatch.
[10:07.85]I know that's a fucking sin to say.
[10:09.81]Past LQ, thanks for three months, man.
[10:11.31]Welcome.
[10:12.62]I know I shouldn't be streaming TF2 and talking about Overwatch, but... You know.
[10:18.04]It is the thing that's coming out, like, next week.
[10:20.10]So... Sometimes... Sometimes you have to talk about it.
[10:27.94]Fuck... My face.
[10:30.53]How could you be so bad at one game?
[10:32.37]I don't know.
[10:33.63]Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.
[10:34.41]I hurt heavy.
[10:36.39]What is that?
[10:40.89]Why can't you just be good?
[10:43.93]Why am I shooting these guys?
[10:44.81]Throw a P at them.
[10:47.15]That only got... That got the medic.
[10:48.48]That's it.
[10:49.30]Are you kidding me?
[10:49.88]Well, at least I killed the fucking guy.
[10:54.58]Well, welcome to chat.
[10:59.28]I pre-purchased Overwatch today.
[11:00.61]I cannot wait till that game comes out.
[11:03.71]I'm going to lose my mind.
[11:08.05]This game is so old, but Jerma's so bad still.
[11:11.71]I don't know if you're aware of this, but this is the first time I've played this game in probably like seven months.
[11:20.07]I'm happy that I have a positive KD right now.
[11:22.26]That's pretty much what I'm... Blizzard, Valve...
[11:34.28]We're not going to have a Blizzard versus Valve chat.
[11:37.52]It's just the games are good.
[11:38.78]I want to play matchmaking, but doesn't it not exist right now?
[11:45.09]I can't even hit this guy.
[11:45.99]I told you sniper is a bad idea.
[11:54.27]Come the fuck on, really?
[11:56.85]I'm just going to fucking throw myself off the cliff in a second.
[12:03.66]Alright, you know, that's like eight misses in a row, so we're just diving off the fucking edge.
[12:08.00]And I'm playing a different class.
[12:08.98]Give me demo with... What do I want to put on?
[12:22.73]I can't wait until the TF2 matchmaking releases.
[12:26.05]You should have did a pogchamp right there.
[12:27.75]That's the wrong... You did the wrong face.
[12:30.54]Loosed cannons still suck, or is it good?
[12:33.25]I'm out of the loop, as they say.
[12:35.05]I don't know if it's any good.
[12:36.05]I remember this thing was actually pretty fun to play with.
[12:46.56]Way back when.
[12:47.42]Is that guy dead?
[12:50.59]Oh.
[12:59.24]Everyone's just doing... I just said Pob Champs.
[13:03.34]Everyone's doing their Pob Champs.
[13:06.40]What a dummy.
[13:13.38]Something does not feel right in the sensitivity department to me right now.
[13:16.33]I really don't know why.
[13:17.13]It almost feels like the game is... I'm going to turn off local recordings.
[13:23.66]Something does not feel right.
[13:26.28]At all.
[13:28.02]At all.
[13:28.54]It's almost like there's an input delay when I'm moving my mouse around.
[13:31.56]I don't have an explanation for that.
[13:42.26]Paw, yeah.
[13:43.42]Can I see some paw champs in the chat, please?
[13:51.39]I need to mess with this.
[13:52.69]I need to back it up.
[13:56.00]V-Sync?
[13:57.18]Why would V-Sync be turned on?
[13:59.88]I have an uninstalled TF2.
[14:00.86]TF2's been installed for like four years.
[14:04.72]I play games good.
[14:05.70]Well, then you should stream.
[14:10.24]People like to see that.
[14:21.56]Maybe I gotta, like, take a look at the settings, make sure, like, nothing reverted on me or something.
[14:27.14]Does it feel like something could have?
[14:30.10]Wow, I don't have anything loaded either.
[14:32.71]This is gonna be a wasted Uber.
[14:33.55]Well, maybe not totally wasted, but wasted nonetheless.
[14:44.05]Whoa, excuse me, excuse me.
[14:50.78]Ugh!
[14:52.78]Alright, let me... What is my... What is going on here in my graphic settings?
[14:58.36]Something does not feel right.
[15:05.07]No, this is all... It should be the way it is.
[15:08.15]Nothing's changed.
[15:13.97]I'm gonna cut it to full screen.
[15:15.37]Uh-oh.
[15:19.24]Tone?
[15:22.50]Tone man zero.
[15:30.30]That actually feels a little better.
[15:35.30]Maybe something to do with running out of the window.
[15:36.50]I don't know.
[15:41.65]Oh, we lost.
[15:47.41]We lose.
[15:47.83]I'm going to move this down.
[16:01.54]Moving things around.
[16:05.16]Are there really already 1,400 people here?
[16:08.74]God damn, I forgot this game is popular.
[16:11.46]I forget that sometimes.
[16:12.46]I'm going to play Medic.
[16:22.75]Please, please don't do that to me.
[16:24.93]I need to be able to see if people subscribe.
[16:26.69]There you go.
[16:28.45]Alright, what do I got?
[16:29.03]Crits?
[16:30.17]What does that guy got?
[16:31.53]Okay, I'll do crits.
[16:32.95]I'm gonna do crits because this guy's doing that.
[16:34.20]There's a thing where Microsoft is forcing vSync for applications.
[16:43.32]It dubs games.
[16:44.12]If you go to the Xbox smart glass tile, you can... I got Windows 7, man.
[16:51.15]I don't got Windows 10.
[16:58.87]Germany.
[16:59.37]What did I cause?
[17:00.01]What did I do?
[17:03.09]Want more bad things?
[17:05.78]Just gonna... Alright, go, go, go.
[17:09.60]Get some kills, buddy.
[17:11.52]Oh, the double uber.
[17:13.24]The double uber.
[17:15.36]That guy just got everybody.
[17:20.73]Very good.
[17:23.37]Windows... Yeah, I don't want Windows 10.
[17:25.63]Why would I want Windows 10?
[17:31.85]Still got it.
[17:32.29]You guys, some people in the chat didn't think I, you know, that I still got it.
[17:36.59]Still got it.
[17:42.37]No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[17:48.01]Very bright, too.
[17:49.63]It's hurting my retinas.
[17:54.28]What's wrong with Windows 10?
[17:55.04]Nothing's wrong with Windows 10.
[17:56.96]I don't have, like, a problem with Windows 10.
[17:58.30]I just, I'm too lazy to actually do the upgrade.
[18:04.30]Where'd you go?
[18:04.70]Where'd you go?
[18:13.10]Wait, what did that person say?
[18:14.00]I was thinking about getting Windows 8.1 near the end, but then Windows 10 came out and just ruined everything.
[18:24.00]I hated Windows 8.10.
[18:25.10]8.1.
[18:25.18]Windows 8.1 was an atrocity.
[18:26.79]I hated every second of it.
[18:35.16]Obvious Ninja.
[18:36.08]Is that three months?
[18:38.28]That is three months.
[18:40.50]That's a triple, man.
[18:41.20]Thanks a lot.
[18:41.64]Welcome back.
[18:44.01]I'm, like, deeply in deep-seated love with you.
[18:47.01]I gotta stop saying that, because some people are gonna take that, like, actually seriously.
[18:50.37]I should probably chill on the deep-seated love conversations.
[18:56.46]Yeah, do I just have, like, two medics as a medic?
[18:59.64]And this guy's just being a fucking statue over here.
[19:03.03]He's gone.
[19:04.07]See you later.
[19:05.23]Bye.
[19:05.61]Maybe I'm going to pop out.
[19:09.11]I'm going to play something else.
[19:10.09]I'm going to play a different class.
[19:13.11]Just start shooting your crit needles.
[19:15.83]Get some kills with the crits.
[19:18.80]Oh, you failed me.
[19:20.38]You failed me, dude.
[19:21.54]You fucking failed me.
[19:22.62]Wait, what?
[19:24.36]I can't really move right now.
[19:30.42]And that would be...
[19:32.40]How long is it, four months?
[19:34.96]Like, I don't even fucking, like, I don't give a shit about this game right now.
[19:37.77]Like, four medics.
[19:39.91]Two medics.
[19:43.19]I'm gonna go back to... You wanna do the real do you still got it test?
[19:49.65]I'm gonna see if I actually still got it.
[19:52.70]This is the surefire way for me to tell.
[19:57.74]Do you still got it?
[19:59.92]Hmm.
[20:19.60]Don't still got it.
[20:21.44]Oh no, I do not still got it.
[20:25.61]Nope.
[20:28.53]I'm going to go regular.
[20:30.21]Regular default rocket launcher.
[20:34.63]Oh no, I fucking forgot about all this stuff.
[20:38.78]Still have this thing.
[20:41.30]Hanzo, play the game incoming.
[20:43.86]No.
[20:46.72]Still framerating.
[20:47.42]I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[20:49.40]It's starting to piss me off.
[20:52.91]Ranger Latham.
[20:54.47]Thanks a lot, man.
[20:55.47]Welcome back.
[20:55.91]Just wanted to get something in my eye.
[20:58.89]Both eyes.
[20:59.41]That was odd.
[21:06.48]How about scout?
[21:07.40]Not here.
[21:07.80]We're gonna get rid of the sentry.
[21:09.20]Sneak attack.
[21:12.89]Crits win games.
[21:15.27]Crits win games, guys.
[21:16.55]Remember that.
[21:17.01]That's a tip.
[21:20.07]Teleport down.
[21:28.26]Kinda doing stuff right now.
[21:32.16]Just jumping around in circles.
[21:33.68]Fuck it, who cares.
[21:38.50]Also, I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I kinda just wanted to play this to chill and like, re-chat and talk to you guys, rather than give a shit about the cart.
[21:46.14]So.
[21:47.32]Take that for what you will.
[21:48.86]Take that for what you will.
[21:49.68]Look at all these fucking, look at all these, look at this, like, 200 Ubers going on right now.
[21:56.68]Are you guys fucking for real?
[22:04.69]Overwatch jokes.
[22:07.13]Don't launch me over here.
[22:07.89]Do not launch me over to the fucking engineer.
[22:16.64]No bullets left.
[22:17.40]Did I get it?
[22:20.26]Haberslash.
[22:21.16]Haberslash, welcome, man.
[22:22.20]Thank you so much for the subscription.
[22:25.22]You are... I almost just said the L word again, but I don't want to get anybody's hopes up.
[22:31.19]Holy fuck, that guy got fucking strapped.
[22:34.11]Holy fuck, guys.
[22:35.47]I'm like, I don't even like care.
[22:37.87]What is like wrong with me tonight?
[22:40.39]I'm trying to like, look at how excited I just was about that.
[22:48.48]Don't kill me.
[22:49.32]Please don't kill me.
[22:52.20]I died.
[22:56.46]Can you tell us about what you didn't?
[22:57.64]Can you tell us about method gaming?
[23:00.52]Did you just say method fucking gaming?
[23:03.16]Holy crap.
[23:06.43]That was like 60 years ago.
[23:07.89]I'm surprised you know what that was.
[23:09.17]At least I killed somebody.
[23:19.35]Pushing without a Reinhardt.
[23:21.51]You messed up.
[23:30.18]Feels like my interp is a bit... Yeah, I don't know.
[23:33.66]I don't know.
[23:34.34]What the fuck is going on with this guy?
[23:40.27]Method Gaming was an old YouTube community channel that I was a part of.
[23:44.57]That was a long time ago.
[23:49.83]You know, that's how I met Boo.
[23:51.19]Boo and MLC Stealth were both in Method Gaming.
[23:53.15]That's how I met both of them.
[23:58.12]Whoa.
[23:59.98]I think I might have just killed somebody.
[24:01.84]Maybe.
[24:07.98]No!
[24:12.86]When the going goes tough, you just rip open the sunflower seeds and just start chewing them.
[24:36.18]Holy shit, somebody actually completed Jupiter.
[24:37.86]That's kind of crazy.
[24:40.78]You got an odd name.
[24:48.30]Sergeant Nipple?
[24:49.96]Am I getting that right?
[24:52.82]Sergeant Nipple.
[24:53.74]Oh, God, another one.
[24:55.04]Hold on, can't look.
[24:56.80]And Glow Rails.
[24:59.22]What was it?
[24:59.48]How long was it?
[24:59.90]Two months?
[25:01.02]Welcome to both of you.
[25:01.64]Thank you so much, both of you, for subscribing to the channel.
[25:09.69]Shit, you're going to medic on me.
[25:19.19]You want to keep watching when things are happening?
[25:21.25]Well, thanks for coming out, Fib.
[25:23.15]I'm glad you showed up for as long as you did.
[25:26.43]Thank you.
[25:27.23]I was certain he was his partner.
[25:40.00]A girl saw my glue man shirt and said, what the hell is that?
[25:42.21]So thank you.
[25:44.65]Did you explain it?
[25:45.57]Did you get an opportunity to explain what the hell it was?
[25:49.03]You should have.
[25:49.39]You should have been like, this is the world's greatest superhero to ever live.
[25:54.82]I want to like a rocket jump, but I'm kind of scared to.
[26:02.34]I just got insta-killed.
[26:08.99]Doesn't Holy Macbeth III handle your stream highlights?
[26:11.85]Yes, he will.
[26:13.99]He's going to be the guy that's going to take care of all of it.
[26:17.78]Whoa.
[26:19.72]Should I play Spy?
[26:20.34]I feel like I'll be less irritated playing Spy.
[26:36.12]One more go at it.
[26:39.14]Do I like garlic bread?
[26:39.93]I love garlic bread.
[26:40.77]It's incredible.
[26:41.71]John.
[26:42.15]Action sloth, too.
[26:43.27]Damn, that's like two people back to back.
[26:45.53]Holy crap.
[26:46.19]Holy crap.
[26:47.21]Holy crap.
[27:01.25]Forgive me for not seeing exactly who you were.
[27:03.74]I will look in one second.
[27:04.82]But both of you, back to back, thank you so much.
[27:06.64]I saw one of you.
[27:08.48]Welcome to the stream.
[27:09.50]Thank you.
[27:10.14]Thank you.
[27:10.70]That's all I can say is thank you.
[27:11.64]I'm dead.
[27:16.05]What a fucking sick... Spoke a little too soon there.
[27:21.21]Just a tad too soon.
[27:22.57]I want to play Spy.
[27:27.53]You want to see if I still got it?
[27:29.96]I still fucking got it.
[27:35.78]What is my spy loadout right now?
[27:37.30]Dead Ringer?
[27:41.08]Where are my emotes?
[27:41.68]You got them.
[27:42.26]Action sloth, thank you.
[27:43.08]And then there was John, too.
[27:43.98]Where's John?
[27:44.40]I want to see John write something so I can say thanks, John.
[27:48.78]Alright, we're just going in as a scout.
[27:54.52]We're going to be the biggest shitty in the world.
[27:58.26]Look at how bad we're being right now, and it doesn't even matter.
[28:01.26]Look at just how terrible I'm being.
[28:04.06]I wasn't even looking.
[28:05.24]I'm going to kill this guy.
[28:09.35]I would have killed that guy.
[28:10.43]You saw it.
[28:10.89]I can't believe this game came out in 2007.
[28:19.61]It's a shock.
[28:20.31]It really is.
[28:21.03]It's insane that this game has been out for as long as it has.
[28:25.36]Okay, let's go with the wrench.
[28:28.83]Usually there's a sentry gun up here around the corner And I'm sure there is and you knew You knew I'm dead What the fuck just happened?
[28:49.61]Whose head did I just bounce off of?
[28:51.23]I just like springboarded off of somebody's fucking head What that was doesn't make any sense
[28:58.60]Alright, I need to open up a thing for a second.
[29:00.67]Hold on.
[29:03.21]I would have killed that engineer.
[29:04.07]That guy, that engineer was dead.
[29:06.09]Certain.
[29:08.43]Oh, well.
[29:14.55]Dashboard.
[29:16.50]Okay, now I can see the subscriptions.
[29:21.26]So thank you to Captain Fordo, who just subscribed.
[29:25.21]Action Sloth and John Slaughter.
[29:27.19]Both of you.
[29:27.69]1, 2, 3, back to back.
[29:28.37]Thanks so much, guys.
[29:29.92]I appreciate it.
[29:30.50]You guys rock.
[29:33.22]Much love.
[29:41.18]How much do I bench press?
[29:42.16]Not very much right now.
[29:43.05]I can tell you that much.
[29:50.13]Back in my heyday, I could bench press like 175, 180.
[29:53.93]That was my max.
[29:57.44]I'm not paying any attention.
[29:59.46]Again, I'm not paying any attention to this game.
[30:02.10]I'm just walking around in circles talking.
[30:04.65]This guy's dead.
[30:30.21]I'm just gonna play fucking Stardew Valley instead.
[30:31.91]I want the actual... the actual invisibility watch.
[30:38.56]None of this bullshit.
[30:51.34]You sucks.
[30:53.43]You probably do.
[30:55.03]Oh, I know I do, actually.
[30:58.95]Do you see what is going on here?
[31:02.45]I backstabbed that heavy and a second later he died.
[31:05.77]What is my ping?
[31:08.15]I don't get it.
[31:09.31]This is the shit I was talking about.
[31:11.91]I don't have any idea.
[31:17.17]Things are happening a second too late and my ping is 55.
[31:20.55]I don't know.
[31:25.61]I'm going to have to eat some... Yeah, that's right.
[31:26.69]I'm going to have to eat some stress sunflowers.
[31:28.23]That's correct.
[31:33.70]Remind me again why N is next to B for me to press it.
[31:42.37]Oh, for the love of God.
[31:46.79]Get me out of here.
[31:55.23]Server must be shitty.
[31:56.85]Seems like it's fine.
[31:59.59]I got all my bars, man.
[32:04.49]Let's go.
[32:05.03]We're going to go default with the Chargin' Targe.
[32:18.87]Something's not right.
[32:19.51]That's all I know.
[32:25.88]How many hours do I have in TF2?
[32:27.78]Thousands.
[32:28.42]Literally probably like three or four thousand.
[32:40.17]Hmm, I gotta hit there.
[32:40.95]Where's the sentry?
[32:50.78]Right across?
[32:57.00]Yikes.
[32:59.66]Oh, I'm dead.
[33:02.64]Please no text wall.
[33:03.72]Yeah, don't, like, spam, like, walls of text.
[33:06.15]It'll anger me.
[33:13.76]It also, like, doesn't help that, um...
[33:18.41]That has been so long since I've played this game.
[33:21.09]Can I, like, be, like, a MOBA?
[33:22.65]Can I make, like, a smurf account?
[33:25.07]Like, temporarily?
[33:25.83]To, like, get back into the swing of things?
[33:27.91]Fucking spy.
[33:36.44]These people are just everywhere right now.
[33:52.42]That was weird.
[33:55.16]That was real weird.
[34:03.57]I know you're a spy.
[34:04.43]I'm not going to let you backstab me.
[34:06.98]Well, you're a Dead Ringer.
[34:08.04]There you go.
[34:14.84]Shit.
[34:15.80]Shit!
[34:22.28]Take me up the chat elevator.
[34:23.67]A subscriber.
[34:37.86]Ramirez the gnome.
[34:42.22]Thanks a lot dude, welcome.
[34:45.44]Welcome to the uh... Welcome to the piss drinkers where we drink piss on stream.
[34:51.42]I'm going to change servers.
[34:53.28]So, in the meantime, hang tight for just a second.
[34:57.51]It needs to be a secret where I'm going.
[35:00.07]People isn't going to figure it out in two seconds anyways, but it's okay.
[35:10.70]What do I want to play?
[35:17.46]I don't know.
[35:22.85]It's been so long.
[35:23.83]Where do I want to go?
[35:25.89]The opportunities are endless.
[35:31.05]How about... Yeah, fine.
[35:39.56]Whatever.
[35:39.82]I'll play here.
[35:45.28]That works.
[35:46.06]Uh-oh.
[35:46.80]I think I lost TF2.
[35:47.42]I did.
[35:52.09]Oh well.
[35:53.39]No, it's back.
[35:54.24]It's back.
[35:55.54]Don't ever say never.
[35:57.80]Never say never, guys.
[36:04.34]Yeah, Nathan is... I haven't figured out if this is the biggest mistake I've made in the last, like, two months.
[36:09.34]Is playing this game again.
[36:11.68]We'll find out.
[36:20.44]Hydro?
[36:22.13]Does anybody even play on Hydro?
[36:23.43]Can you, like, actually even still get on a server in Hydro?
[36:28.19]Stream's over, guys.
[36:29.01]Go home.
[36:33.36]I'll play heavy.
[36:34.08]When all else fails, just play heavy.
[36:39.66]What am I up at 1am for?
[36:40.84]That's a really, really, really good question.
[36:45.10]I have no idea.
[36:47.22]I just wanted to try this game for the first time in a long time and see if I still like it.
[37:00.44]I probably would have been better off streaming Stardew.
[37:03.80]Probably.
[37:19.15]Rinny02.
[37:21.90]Welcome.
[37:22.36]Thank you for subscribing.

[37:27.02]Play Rage Medic if you want.
[37:29.37]Don't bother me.
[37:29.83]Do we have any Engineers?
[37:32.29]Two, yeah.
[37:37.96]I don't know if we have any Medics.
[37:52.42]Remember what I said?
[37:52.96]Three games?
[37:55.16]Just gotta play three games.
[37:56.36]What is on me?
[37:59.02]Give me some of that juice, please.
[38:00.00]Give me some juice.

[38:08.38]We're going Pyro with the default setup.
[38:12.35]I am the raddest girl in the honey.
[38:14.79]I will kill you just for you.
[38:16.95]Just for him!

[38:23.88]Is it actually Mexican Tea Radio?
[38:26.50]Mexicant Radio.
[38:28.68]Thank you for subscribing.
[38:29.56]Welcome to the family.
[38:31.62]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[38:33.22]Why am I not matchmaking?
[38:34.46]How do you do it?
[38:36.16]Can you actually do it?
[38:38.06]I don't know how to do it.
[38:39.71]I don't know how to matchmake.
[38:40.75]I really just don't.
[38:47.83]Is it in like a special list or something?
[38:56.82]That's a spy.
[38:57.64]That was great, but it didn't hit him.
[39:12.11]Yup.
[39:16.61]Shit.
[39:19.15]You have a million that I have not used?
[39:20.69]A million what?
[39:24.07]I didn't catch the first part of that conversation.
[39:28.76]I have a beta pass.
[39:29.48]Do you want the beta pass?
[39:31.92]I mean, maybe.
[39:35.14]I don't know.
[39:35.94]Do you want me to do matchmaking right now?
[39:38.76]After like a seven-month hiatus, do you want me to come in and just get shit on?
[39:41.86]If you think I'm getting beat in pubs, you have no idea how bad I'll get beat in matchmaking.
[39:51.24]Extra passes.
[39:51.84]Well, we'll see.
[39:53.30]Let me play for a little bit.
[39:55.33]Figure out how to actually play the game again.
[39:57.29]And then we'll go from there.
[39:58.07]I don't know.
[39:58.65]We'll see.
[40:04.29]Thought that was gonna hit him.
[40:10.88]You want me to invite you?
[40:11.70]To this game?
[40:13.26]It's... I... I can give you the IP in like a whisper before I get into a game.
[40:22.78]TF2 is notorious for... Magi... That's going to be a hard one to say.
[40:34.39]Magi Rush... Magi Rush Strawberry?
[40:38.05]Magi Rush Strawberry?
[40:39.11]Am I saying that right?
[40:41.73]Probably not, but thank you anyways.
[40:43.37]Welcome.
[40:45.85]Yeah, I'll give you the IP when I change.
[40:47.82]What is this?
[40:48.20]What?
[40:51.91]Alright.
[40:53.96]Let's open it.
[40:55.10]Somebody just gave one to me.
[40:56.22]Thank you very much, whoever just gave that to me.
[40:59.06]Is there a special... No, don't delete it.
[41:00.96]There's a guy in my face.
[41:10.27]One more round.
[41:12.13]One more round and then I'll dip my toes into the pool of matchmaking.
[41:16.91]It's gonna be a fucking disaster, I can tell you that.
[41:30.49]Damn it.
[41:32.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[41:35.97]Oh, God.
[41:36.75]Am I out of ammo?
[41:38.67]I'm just going to Annihilator him.
[41:41.73]Neon Annihilator.
[41:42.36]That's what I'm going to do.
[41:43.22]That's what I'm going for.
[41:50.18]Stay alive, Medic.
[41:52.96]I did stuff.
[41:53.76]I kind of did stuff.
[41:54.78]A little bit.
[41:57.77]a bit rusty you could yeah you could say that it's only been like six hundred years since I played this game I'm gonna go scout I feel like I could I could probably still Twitch aim maybe possibly
[42:27.84]What was that guy doing?
[42:29.74]That kill didn't count.
[42:30.48]That was a free kill.
[42:31.36]That one doesn't count.
[42:41.09]Fuck.
[42:44.95]I'm not happy right now.
[42:56.49]God, another subscription?
[42:58.83]Oh, Spider-Man!
[43:01.37]Spider-Man, of course it's Spider-Man.
[43:05.72]Thank you, Spider-Man.

[43:30.88]I mean, you can't say, everyone's gonna say it.
[43:33.22]There's no way he's gonna, you're never gonna get that.

[43:44.08]Thank you.
[43:44.96]That's all I can say.
[43:47.10]That's all I can say.
[43:48.28]Where should this go?
[43:49.22]I don't even know, like Cactus Canyon at all.
[43:55.82]Not over here.
[43:56.36]Maybe over here.
[44:06.19]Someone found you.
[44:07.97]It's pretty easy to find somebody in a TF2 pub.
[44:12.01]Unfortunately, you can't really hide.
[44:15.65]Not that I want to, like, hide or anything, but, you know, can't really do it.
[44:25.01]What's the ammo on this map?
[44:25.97]I know there's one, like, right next to me, but... What?
[44:30.63]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[44:33.85]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[44:37.75]How do you say this?
[44:39.25]Whoa!

[44:49.18]I'm dead.
[44:49.70]He's going to crit rocket it too.
[44:57.34]I feel like going back to fucking heavy.
[45:01.28]What is going on right now?
[45:03.29]What is going on?
[45:08.79]There's another one.
[45:12.68]Hold on, I gotta move this back.

[45:19.04]Thanks a lot, dude.
[45:19.68]Welcome.
[45:21.07]Appreciate it.
[45:23.93]I love how you take a second to say the name.
[45:25.53]Thanks.
[45:25.99]Well, yeah, of course I am.
[45:27.29]I'm not gonna... People are gonna subscribe.
[45:30.58]I'm gonna say thank you.
[45:31.68]I don't wanna not say thanks.
[45:36.65]Wyrtec.

[45:39.70]Are we still going?
[45:41.12]Smeechy.
[45:41.48]And Smeechy, too.
[45:45.66]I can't even pay attention to what's going on the screen.
[46:03.58]Thank you, everybody.
[46:05.26]That's very, very generous, very kind of you all.
[46:08.04]Thank you.
[46:11.41]It is not necessary, though.
[46:13.77]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[46:15.35]Is that a spy that just... No.
[46:21.77]I get insta-killed.
[46:23.10]I'm okay with that.
[46:23.62]I'm okay with getting crits.

[70:05.73]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[70:11.65]It is getting really late.
[70:13.81]I only wanted to stream for like a couple hours or something.
[70:15.75]Now I'm like exhausted after that last calamity that was the sub train.

[70:52.36]I want to play with Nate.
[70:54.02]I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be streaming.
[70:55.95]It's getting late here.
[70:59.84]Uh, you know what we're gonna do?

[72:26.34]I'll be right back.
[72:29.62]And I'm gonna give that IP to Nate.
[72:31.66]And then, Nate, if you'd like to join the... People aren't gonna hear you talk, unfortunately.
[72:37.52]If you still... Oh, I think I might need to give you the new TeamSpeak.
[72:40.19]I wonder if anybody's even in here.
[72:48.52]Do you have the new TeamSpeak, Nate?
[72:51.53]I wonder.
[72:54.97]Yeah, Hypo, you can hop into.
[72:57.71]I'll PM you both.
[73:00.31]How the hell do you send a PM?
[73:01.17]Alright, here's the server info.
[73:19.42]Can you pass this along to Hypo as well?
[73:25.07]Nate, when you get it.
[73:26.99]Just because I'm currently looking at this stuff.
[73:43.78]Okay.
[73:44.30]Pass that along to Hypo.
[73:47.50]And alright.
[73:48.28]Are we good?
[73:50.24]Are we good?
[73:53.12]I think we're good.
[73:53.80]I think we good.
[73:55.94]Maybe we get to play some video games.
[74:01.03]I hope people can hear them when they come in.
[74:04.35]Can you make a highlight of that sub train?
[74:05.71]Go for it.
[74:07.01]Yeah.
[74:08.13]Do what you got to do.
[74:10.83]Do what you gotta do.
[74:12.91]Blood Baron, thank you for six months.
[74:14.69]That is a six-month sub right there.
[74:17.21]Thank you so much.
[74:20.63]Six months.
[74:22.77]Captain Pringles.
[74:23.65]Look at that.
[74:24.11]We got Captain Pringles in the sub.
[74:26.76]Welcome, dude.
[74:27.44]Thank you.
[74:27.78]Welcome, Captain Pringles.
[74:29.30]You are cool, man.
[74:31.10]Awesome.
[74:33.96]I want to make sure that Nate got that.
[74:44.78]And I'm currently in the streaming room, if you are curious.
[74:51.52]I sent it to you on PM on Twitch.
[74:56.24]I Twitch PM'd you.
[75:02.68]So I'm going to pocket medic you, and you can just do whatever the hell you want.
[75:05.36]I'm going to pocket both of you guys.
[75:08.94]So I'm in there.
[75:11.02]And then I'm going to give you guys an IP when I get in there.
[75:18.18]Alright, let me go here.
[75:21.30]Hold on.
[75:21.78]Sorry.
[75:22.98]What a bad streamer.
[75:25.28]I'm just all disheveled right now, guys.
[75:29.14]I'm sorry.
[75:31.83]I need Nate to come in here and help me.
[75:39.65]Make sure I can hear him.
[75:44.99]This has to come through a different line.
[75:53.50]And here we go.
[75:56.72]Away we go.
[76:05.93]Yeah, I whispered you.
[76:06.89]I already whispered it to you.
[76:09.27]I'll do it again if need be.
[76:29.38]This is supposed to be a TF2 and chill stream.
[76:32.40]Okay, there you go.
[76:40.74]There you are.
[76:45.85]There you are.
[76:47.13]Okay, here he comes.
[76:49.03]Here comes Nate.
[76:52.39]The actual voice actor for the TF2 scout, by the way, if you don't know who he is.
[76:57.16]He's a good dude.
[76:59.39]And I'm going to paste an IP, Nate, into the TeamSpeak chat.
[77:11.54]It's hard for me to add people on Steam because I have so many ads and I'd have to do it later.
[77:15.94]It would take too long.
[77:17.00]My brain can't do it right now.
[77:22.52]But here is a server.
[77:24.09]I'll give you a server.
[77:33.39]Guys, we're starting soon.
[77:42.88]We're going to go here.
[77:48.64]IP is going to be in the team speak.
[77:53.45]When you get around to getting in, you'll see where I am.
[78:01.45]And it'll be in there.
[78:03.87]Alright, I'm going in there.
[78:06.78]I'll just make sure you get in, so I'll give it to you here, too.
[78:11.10]And then pass that info on to Hypo, if you can.
[78:13.30]Actually, I can give it to Hypo.
[78:17.30]Hypo, Hypo, Hypo, where are you?
[78:22.30]Hypo!
[78:28.74]Hypo, speak to me!
[78:36.98]Did you get in?
[78:37.52]Alright.
[78:45.05]Switching back over.
[78:45.93]Thank you for your patience.
[78:48.57]I am sorry that it had to be that way.
[78:52.35]But it did.
[78:54.24]But it did.
[79:00.66]And the round's like starting right now.
[79:06.33]Did you get in?
[79:07.65]What is your name on here?
[79:09.03]Anyways.
[79:16.29]We're pretty... I really don't even like this map and we're on it though.
[79:21.46]Butts.
[79:22.46]Hey, there's the guy.
[79:23.90]Hey, how's it going?
[79:25.88]What's going on, man?
[79:27.02]How are you?
[79:28.38]Doing good, dude.
[79:29.36]How about...
[79:31.43]The sub train?
[79:33.39]The thing that will remain nameless?
[79:35.63]The name of the... That was fucking crazy.
[79:39.56]My favorite part was when somebody subbed.
[79:43.44]Oh, yeah, I like that part too.
[79:46.62]That was crazy.
[79:49.70]That happened to me one time before.
[79:51.50]Yeah?
[79:51.82]And not even close to that fucking crazy.
[79:55.40]It was like 80 people, maybe?
[79:58.33]Like...
[79:59.58]I don't even know.
[80:00.84]Yeah.
[80:02.26]I have no idea.
[80:03.24]The only thing that I know is I almost died during that.
[80:07.77]I did see that.
[80:09.61]I did see the near-death experience.
[80:11.29]Yeah, again, guys, if you don't know, again, this is... How do you say your last name?
[80:15.61]Vetterlein.
[80:16.39]This is Nathan Vetterlein.
[80:17.82]This is the actual, for real, real TF2 voice scout.
[80:21.72]Oh, God.
[80:23.32]Hi!
[80:23.70]What's happening?
[80:25.52]Uh, it says the server's full, but I don't know.
[80:28.92]Uh, it shouldn't be.
[80:31.20]Yeah.
[80:32.00]My connector says it is.
[80:34.14]Heh.
[80:34.68]Well, we can go somewhere else.
[80:36.88]Sure.
[80:37.24]That map sucks anyway.
[80:38.24]Let's be honest.
[80:38.82]What?!
[80:39.44]You don't have Borneo?
[80:40.02]Uh, I, I, uh, no.
[80:42.49]It's fine.
[80:43.19]I love it.
[80:43.61]Borneo is fucking unbelievable, dude.
[80:45.93]Borneo.
[80:46.93]That's in Switzerland.
[80:48.77]I love Borneo.
[80:52.32]And we get right in and we get right out.
[80:54.49]That's how this works.
[80:58.97]Yeah, I know what you're saying about the friend thing.
[81:00.83]I'm sure you have it way worse than I do too.
[81:03.41]I have like 250 pending invites and I was like, I can't even... I'm never gonna... It's hard to just like... Once you're like Steam Pro, anybody can have anybody's name and it just gets odd.
[81:16.58]Okay, here's the new... I do want to give this to Hypo because he wanted to play.
[81:21.44]Yeah, I'll get them.
[81:22.02]I got them on Steam.
[81:22.66]Oh, you already got them?
[81:23.44]Okay.
[81:23.74]I got them on Steam, so if you post it in chat, I can... So if you look under the TeamSpeak, under the streaming room?
[81:29.41]Yeah.
[81:29.73]Okay.
[81:30.33]Make sure to get into that one and then make sure he gets it.
[81:32.78]Okay.
[81:33.08]I'll post it to him.
[81:35.34]Okay, I'm sorry to have to say this, but literally every single person in my chat right now is losing their mind and they're saying he has to do a voice line.
[81:43.79]Do I have to?
[81:44.95]You don't have to, but the people are speaking right now like crazy.
[81:48.50]People say all kinds of things.
[81:53.24]Do it again.
[81:53.86]Do it again.
[81:54.34]Do it again.
[81:54.78]Do it again.
[81:55.72]I don't want to do it.
[81:58.41]I kind of have to.
[81:59.31]Alright.
[81:59.61]I will.
[82:00.07]I will.
[82:00.35]I'll do it.
[82:01.49]Alright.
[82:01.95]But we got to kill some shit first.
[82:03.33]We will.
[82:03.65]We will.
[82:04.35]Because you've been streaming for an hour and a half and I don't think you've killed anything yet.
[82:07.07]I don't think I've killed a person.
[82:08.23]You're right.
[82:08.51]No, I don't think so.
[82:10.09]Which team are you on?
[82:11.91]I am going on to... Med.
[82:14.64]I'm going on to whatever team I happen to get on.
[82:17.36]Okay.
[82:17.46]Okay.
[82:19.51]I'm bbqstupid.
[82:21.01]Alright, I'm on red.
[82:22.83]Did Hypo get in?
[82:24.55]I sent him the thing.
[82:26.81]Looks like he's coming.
[82:28.83]You'll know.
[82:29.19]His name's Hypo in here for sure.
[82:31.62]I'm friends with him on Steam, I think, too.
[82:33.96]If he gets in... Same.
[82:36.46]I'm gonna bump it into my microphone and shit now.
[82:40.26]Yeah, I turned my stream on more than an hour and a half ago.
[82:43.34]And it seriously just... I had fucking done that damn thing.
[82:50.38]I got, like, mad at, like, the fact that I wasn't playing well.
[82:53.24]And then all of a sudden, my life changed.
[82:55.35]You had a near-life experience.
[83:03.78]A near life experience.
[83:08.12]At the very end of the stream, I'm going to say thank you to every single person.
[83:12.63]Right now, my body and my mind is having trouble keeping up.
[83:15.97]Yeah, you just need to kill stuff.
[83:18.15]I just need to do things.
[83:19.49]I need to actually play a video game.
[83:20.97]I'm on twitch.tv right now, guys.
[83:23.68]Oh, that's a pretty good site, I heard.
[83:25.61]Runbyamazon.com?
[83:27.53]It's run by Amazon.
[83:28.59]I thought it was just bought by Amazon.
[83:30.05]Really?
[83:31.23]Um, I mean, it's kind of the same thing, right?
[83:34.63]They call the shots.
[83:36.22]They know that they call the shots, yeah.
[83:39.62]Oh, fuck, okay.
[83:40.36]This is the only bad thing about TF2 is my backpack is completely full and I just found a steak.
[83:48.66]I'm having trouble hitting this heavy in the head.
[83:58.27]I'll be right there.
[83:59.21]I got you.
[84:01.91]I gotta throw something over there.
[84:04.59]Thanks for the heals, Trisha.
[84:06.07]Thanks for the heals.
[84:09.25]Alright, whatever.
[84:09.93]I gotta keep this steak.
[84:10.97]I gotta have steak.
[84:13.36]I think you're in a new tax bracket now, as somebody said.
[84:17.29]Probably.
[84:18.43]Probably.
[84:18.95]You're in a new tax bracket?
[84:22.67]I was saying you should buy an island and just retire from games altogether.
[84:26.69]Just never play a video game again.
[84:28.54]Just do the sub stream and then never play a game ever again.
[84:33.20]Dude, that's an amazing stream.
[84:34.60]If you just turn your stream on and it's nothing but subs for an hour.
[84:38.66]That is...
[84:40.34]I mean, some streams are like that, man.
[84:42.39]Some streams actually are like that.
[84:44.43]I know.
[84:45.07]I don't know if I want to be one of those streams.
[84:46.91]Well, there's a give and take, I suppose.
[84:49.09]But yeah, sometimes you just kind of want to play some games.
[84:54.45]That guy just walked right by me.
[84:57.76]That wasn't his head.
[84:59.46]That was, apparently.
[85:00.32]Oh, fuck.
[85:05.70]Oh, that's a double fuck.
[85:08.56]I got this.
[85:09.30]I just want to die.
[85:10.18]Just kill me.
[85:11.10]No, no.
[85:14.74]We got this.
[85:15.38]Uh-oh.
[85:15.56]Wait.
[85:15.70]You haven't played this in forever?
[85:18.39]Seven months, probably.
[85:28.84]It could be even more than that.
[85:30.36]I have no idea at this point.
[85:32.54]I'm having trouble actually playing.
[85:34.01]I really am.
[85:35.11]Well, you've had some distractions.
[85:36.53]I think it's valid.
[85:37.75]Okay, I'm going to play heavy.
[85:40.47]That's why I play heavy, dude.
[85:41.43]What are you playing right now?
[85:42.77]Heavy.
[85:43.65]Alright, I'm going to pocket you.
[85:45.19]What do you want?
[85:46.05]Uber.
[85:46.17]He wants the real Uber gun, guys.
[85:47.15]I just like to stand there and shoot.
[85:49.81]Yeah, that's true.
[85:50.69]That's true.
[85:58.46]I pretty much just play Pyro or Heavy when I'm streaming because that way I can just hold one button and look at chat.
[86:05.33]Where are you right now?
[86:06.93]Give me an E. I'm in the sky.
[86:09.37]The sky?
[86:09.91]Are you TCLing?
[86:11.33]Are you doing TCL?
[86:13.75]Why?
[86:14.59]What's going on here?
[86:15.29]Why am I doing this?
[86:16.43]Is that a drug?
[86:17.81]Somebody's drugging me right now.
[86:18.89]Look at this.
[86:20.61]Yeah, I don't smoke.
[86:22.39]Hey, neither do I. Nice.
[86:25.07]I'm a non-smoker.
[86:27.27]Are you a drinkist?
[86:28.63]Yes, I do, but not very much.
[86:30.85]Sure.
[86:31.59]Well, yeah, you're too old now.
[86:33.13]Now it's social.
[86:38.52]Okay, I just jumped onto the cart into two heavies and a medic.
[86:41.10]This may have been a bad decision.
[86:42.42]Did somebody just say too old?
[86:45.06]Yeah.
[86:47.26]Yeah.
[86:47.64]Yeah, he's right.
[86:48.46]I am.
[86:50.07]You gotta get up in the mornings.
[86:53.66]No, I get up in the morning.
[86:54.56]It's hard for me to do that.
[86:55.92]I know.
[86:56.28]That's what I'm saying.
[87:00.12]How old are you?
[87:01.59]Are you like 20s, 30s?
[87:03.99]What are you?
[87:05.59]I'm 33.
[87:05.95]Oh, you're a triple three?
[87:07.81]Yeah, dude.
[87:09.07]Wow.
[87:09.87]Alright.
[87:10.71]I know.
[87:11.65]That's why it's okay for me to say it because I can relate.
[87:13.77]Yeah, I can relate to that.
[87:16.25]I can relate to a triple three.
[87:17.85]I mean, I'm a single three.
[87:19.03]I'm just a single three.
[87:20.31]Yeah, give it time.
[87:22.13]And by the way, ladies, I do happen to be single.
[87:25.00]A single three.
[87:26.42]I'm standing still.
[87:28.68]Stop doing dumb jokes and play Team Fortress 2.
[87:31.72]Where are you?
[87:32.28]Here.
[87:33.46]Is that you?
[87:33.80]Oh, yeah.
[87:34.80]You're a barbecue man.
[87:35.51]Alright.
[87:36.11]Let's go.
[87:36.49]Okay.
[87:37.15]Fuck them up.
[87:37.71]Literally.
[87:39.39]Literally.
[87:44.48]Didn't we talk about this?
[87:46.14]Can I say it over?
[87:47.56]It is over.
[87:48.58]Oh.
[87:49.34]You're dead.
[87:51.69]Yeah, that happened.
[87:52.73]You're dead.
[87:53.81]Alright, wait.
[87:57.93]That was a mistake.
[88:01.03]And lagged.
[88:02.55]Thank you for the sub.
[88:04.33]We're going to do a, like, it's going to be hard.
[88:07.03]I'm going to have to go back and, like, just look at all these names and send you, like I said, Christmas cards.
[88:11.33]Yeah.
[88:15.97]I'm healing you.
[88:16.47]I got you.
[88:16.93]I'm healing you.
[88:17.33]You don't have to get free going.
[88:18.23]I'm coming back.
[88:20.07]Did Hypo get in?
[88:24.34]I don't think so.
[88:25.48]He said he was trying now.
[88:26.48]That's the last thing he said.
[88:28.88]Maybe he didn't make it.
[88:30.04]We'll get him in the next one.
[88:32.08]Alright, I'm back.
[88:37.08]I'm going to try not to charge in completely this time.
[88:40.81]I got an Uber.
[88:41.55]You ready to cause some carnage?
[88:44.26]Sure, let me get ammo.
[88:45.74]Get some ammo, and then we're gonna cause a mayhem.
[88:49.95]Ready?
[88:50.17]Ready for some mayhem?
[88:51.39]Yeah, I'm ready.
[88:51.79]I'm going in.
[88:52.87]I'm just charging straight in.
[88:53.73]You gotta call for the mayhem.
[88:56.25]Yeah, yeah.
[88:56.97]Mayhem.
[88:57.35]Mayhem.
[88:58.73]I called it.
[88:59.23]Alright, here we go.
[88:59.71]I did it instead.
[89:00.99]Yeah, you had it.
[89:01.67]Nice.
[89:03.06]God, what a stupid barbecue.
[89:05.76]What a stupid fucking barbecue that just was.
[89:08.62]That was fucking stupid.
[89:12.93]Did you guys see that fucking stupid barbecue?
[89:20.02]I'm just dumb delirious right now guys.
[89:21.52]I'm sorry I Was already like kind of tired and now I'm like I've lost all are you in that energy?
[89:29.80]Are you in that weird tired state where everything?

[89:47.15]And you want to stop and then you, like, stop and then you go, like, oh, no, I got to keep going.
[89:51.95]That's what's happening.
[89:52.51]It was like your mind just starts vomiting words and you're not even processing them.
[89:56.77]Yeah.
[89:57.93]Yeah.
[89:58.75]I doubt it.
[90:00.26]Yes, it does.
[90:00.90]It kind of starts happening to me at the end of the work week.
[90:06.66]Oh, we're 14.
[90:07.26]Thanks for the sub.
[90:09.36]Which is kind of a bad thing.
[90:10.48]I'm sorry if I missed people that actually, like, came in and subscribed, not knowing, like, why.
[90:14.75]Like, they're just like, why did you not say anything?
[90:17.73]Uh... It was an incident that happened earlier.
[90:20.17]It was an incident.
[90:22.25]That's all I'll tell you.
[90:25.31]Ooh, thank you.
[90:25.93]Are you ready?
[90:26.45]Yeah, eat that.
[90:27.95]I'm gonna need you to do some fuckin' super-duper, super-duper, scooper-pooper.
[90:32.41]Oh, no!
[90:32.85]Wrong guy.
[90:34.49]It's okay.
[90:35.15]Um... Lag.
[90:37.01]What is... Why is that...
[90:39.08]No, I just thought I was on you and I Ubered the wrong guy.
[90:43.84]I'm what they call a bad player.
[90:47.28]Yeah, see if you call me a bad player after this one.
[90:50.60]Let's see if you see a fucking failed fish in the chat after this one.
[90:55.94]That's it?
[90:57.26]Come on, let's see.
[90:58.28]Oh, I can't believe it.
[90:59.53]You see that one?
[91:00.53]Yeah, it looked like skill-based play from where I was.
[91:05.49]Yeah, alright.
[91:05.85]Next Uber, we'll MLG this.
[91:08.21]Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[91:19.14]Scout over on the left.
[91:20.22]Scout over on the left.
[91:21.88]Oh, that's a spy.
[91:23.32]I healed the shit out of him, too.
[91:24.76]Did he kill you?
[91:26.56]No.
[91:27.22]I'm good.
[91:28.44]I'm on the front.
[91:29.76]Oh, this bee got me, too.
[91:31.86]Oh, that fucking spy.
[91:33.42]Spy.
[91:39.34]You guys.
[91:39.78]You guys are something else.

[91:55.53]Star is on vacation right now, guys.
[91:58.11]Come on.
[91:59.07]We don't talk about Star.
[92:00.09]We don't talk about mean things about Star.
[92:01.69]He's on vacation.
[92:03.29]He's trying to decompress.
[92:05.28]That's a spy.
[92:09.76]Don't let him kill me.
[92:10.52]Please don't let him kill me.
[92:12.04]Where are you?
[92:12.72]I'm alive.

[93:08.22]Yeah, yeah.
[93:09.07]Just run.
[93:09.43]Just trust me.
[93:09.85]Run.
[93:12.29]Like the wind.
[93:13.31]I didn't trust you and I stopped running.
[93:15.09]By the way.
[93:15.47]I don't know why.
[93:17.21]Give me that sandwich.
[93:18.69]Nice.

[93:32.61]No, I... I'm playing just pub medic.
[93:36.05]I'm just healing people and giving... You know, I'm just stuffing it up Nate's ass, essentially.
[93:41.96]I just killed everyone.
[93:42.84]Hey.
[93:44.10]MandyF35, thank you so much.
[93:53.82]We're the greatest heroes in the history of Team Fortress.
[94:02.93]The video game.
[94:04.69]And Bear... Bear Rot the Great.
[94:10.75]Or Barrow the Great.
[94:13.28]I'll try to invite Hypo again.
[94:15.02]Yeah, if not, we can change again.
[94:21.93]It looks like there's space in here.
[94:23.23]Barbecue on top?
[94:24.89]Did we see a barbecue on top there?
[94:26.73]Is that what people are saying?
[94:29.25]Barbecue?
[94:30.21]They were saying you were on the top of the scoreboard there, weren't you?
[94:33.91]I was third, but we were separated by a single point.
[94:36.64]Therefore...
[94:39.26]Uh, I was robbed.
[94:40.66]It's going 100% Demoknight like a total shithead.
[94:43.90]Okay.
[94:44.94]Are you on red now?
[94:46.02]Did you get auto-balanced?
[94:46.86]Oh, you did.
[94:47.28]Hey, we're against each other now.
[94:49.38]Once friends, now mortal enemies.
[94:51.54]Now enemies.
[94:52.16]It's okay.
[94:53.78]We'll be alright.
[94:54.80]We'll get through it.
[94:55.34]Alright.
[94:58.90]Mission begins in 10 seconds.
[95:09.52]Changing server won't work.
[95:10.64]Well, it will work when we get him in first.
[95:13.10]You know, we tell him what the IP is before anybody else.
[95:15.94]Yeah, because he can follow off me too.
[95:17.96]That's good.
[95:21.11]We're going one hundo Demoknight and see if we can make it happen.
[95:24.19]One hundo?
[95:25.41]One hundo Demoknight.
[95:28.27]Straight up hundo.
[95:29.27]Not to be confused with the 50 Demoknight.
[95:36.93]Really?
[95:37.25]Every time he kills Jerma, he's got to say bonk.
[95:39.61]Oh, dear.
[95:39.97]I don't know if you're up for that.
[95:41.81]You up for that?
[95:42.29]Oh!
[95:44.51]I'm dead.
[95:45.51]Oh, did you hear it?
[95:46.07]You guys heard it.
[95:46.87]He did it.
[95:47.41]He just did it.
[95:47.95]No, I didn't.
[95:48.31]That wasn't it.
[95:48.81]He just did it.
[95:49.43]That was it.
[95:50.33]No.
[95:50.81]That was your line.
[95:51.91]That was your line.
[95:52.61]You did it.
[95:54.40]Do you have a favorite line?
[95:56.12]If you have a favorite line, I'll do it.
[95:57.42]I do.
[95:58.04]What's your favorite line?
[95:58.66]My favorite scout line is the car windshield one.
[96:02.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[96:03.78]That is the greatest scout line ever.
[96:09.36]Can you say it?
[96:10.36]I never remember him.
[96:11.31]If you link it for me, I can... Or say it.
[96:15.35]I need to say it out loud, too.
[96:17.41]It's... You're like a car crash in slow motion.
[96:21.23]You're like a car crash in slow motion?
[96:22.13]It's like I'm watching you fly through the windshield.
[96:24.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[96:26.86]Alright, yeah.
[96:27.84]Okay, I can do it.
[96:28.78]I'm like fanboying right now.
[96:30.58]I can't wait for this.
[96:33.13]Alright, I'll do it after this round, okay?
[96:35.03]Okay, alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[96:42.17]That was a double kill.
[96:43.31]But I have to kill you first.
[96:47.87]Dude, actually, it was really weird.
[96:49.35]I've never had this happen.
[96:50.49]Today, I was randomly in the Safeway by my work, and some guy comes up to me.
[96:55.50]He's like, hey, I know this is a little awkward.
[96:58.08]Are you by chance a voice actor?
[96:59.61]I'm like, I am.
[97:01.09]Really?
[97:01.73]How did you know this?
[97:03.07]Yeah, that's weird.
[97:04.01]Just some random dude?
[97:05.60]Yeah, and I was like, have you been watching my stream or something?
[97:08.54]That's the first time that's ever happened.
[97:10.08]People always ask me, they're like, do people notice you on the stream?
[97:12.49]I'm like, fuck no, dude.
[97:13.81]I'm a voice actor.
[97:14.97]Nobody knows me.
[97:18.01]People don't notice me on the street either.
[97:19.89]It's at conventions, baby.
[97:22.35]Yeah, and you actually do videos and stuff too.
[97:24.86]That's awesome.
[97:26.08]That's cool.
[97:26.46]Yeah, just imagine you're walking out of the gym.
[97:29.28]And somebody's just like, hey, Jerma.
[97:31.00]Are you Jerma?
[97:31.90]And you're like, yes.
[97:34.02]Yeah, I would shake his hand.
[97:35.83]I'd say hello.
[97:36.41]I'd talk for him.
[97:36.91]Hell yeah.
[97:37.49]I took a picture with him.
[97:38.27]He's like, we took a picture.
[97:39.03]I'm like, hell yeah, dude.
[97:39.91]Let's take a picture.
[97:40.65]That sounds great.
[97:43.43]Fuck.
[97:44.37]Fucking.
[97:45.61]I suck.
[97:47.21]I don't know.
[97:47.53]I just thought it was funny.
[97:49.37]I thought it was cool.
[97:51.26]I'd never been a part of something like that.
[97:53.64]No, it's awesome.
[97:54.42]That's fucking cool, dude.
[97:56.57]I'm living the dream, guys.
[97:58.11]You are living the dream.
[98:00.29]You're the TF2 scout.
[98:01.53]That's a dream to live.
[98:03.35]Random people know me.
[98:04.89]The dream.
[98:05.21]Do you want me to sign my chest?
[98:09.79]I'm not currently at your location right now, but... Sorry, I'm going to have to respectfully decline.
[98:17.58]You can E-sign it.
[98:18.72]Shit.
[98:18.94]I don't want to die down there.
[98:22.12]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[98:25.85]I was killed by the homie knight.
[98:33.35]Shit, he died.
[98:34.41]Shit.
[98:36.49]This is not working.
[98:37.33]Not working.
[98:38.07]Not working.
[98:38.57]We're going to recalibrate our sensitivity in our brain and we're going to play something else.
[98:42.11]We're going to play... What the fuck am I going to play?
[98:47.27]Maybe I'll play Scout.
[98:49.76]Yeah, I'll play Scout.
[98:51.67]Did you play Scout a lot when you used to play?
[98:55.33]No, not necessarily.
[98:56.79]I mean, Scout was always fun, but my favorite class is Engineer by far.
[98:59.80]I love Engineer.
[99:01.88]Engie?
[99:02.52]Oh yeah, Engineer's my favorite class.
[99:03.82]I fucking love it.
[99:04.94]Okay.
[99:06.80]Every time I play Engie, I spend the entire time trying to build my shit, and then a spy comes up, and then I have to start all over.
[99:13.75]You gotta get that spy awareness.
[99:16.43]Yeah.
[99:18.79]Oh, speaking of subscriptions.
[99:23.11]Oh boy, Etalyx.
[99:27.86]Oh boy, Etalyx just subscribed.
[99:29.16]Ladies and gentlemen, that is Etalyx.
[99:31.30]If you don't know who Etalyx is, then shame on you.
[99:34.72]If you don't know who Etalyx is.
[99:37.30]Can we get some Etalyx spam in the chat, please?
[99:42.11]Can one of the mods please link all of his channels?
[99:44.67]As if that's what we do around here.
[99:50.46]No, thanks.
[99:50.88]Welcome, dude.
[99:52.32]I'm currently in the TeamSpeak up in streaming right now.
[99:56.74]If you want to come say hello, we're just kind of hanging out up there.
[99:59.50]You are more than welcome to come say hello.
[100:01.92]There's someone healing me right now named DoTheVoice in all caps.
[100:06.19]He's going to do the voice.
[100:07.27]He's going to do it.
[100:08.17]We just have to wait.
[100:08.69]We have to be very patient and we have to wait for him to do the voice.
[100:14.38]Oh wait, you're not on my team.
[100:16.03]Never mind.
[100:16.47]I didn't say that.
[100:17.33]Ugh, eyes.
[100:18.89]Why do eyes need to blink?
[100:20.43]We should just be able to keep the pride open with forks.
[100:24.24]Yeah.
[100:30.92]Why is my name the final chapter?
[100:32.20]That seems kind of odd.
[100:33.48]Can we ban him for spamming, please?
[100:37.90]That's a lot of spam, too.
[100:42.03]You have way too much privilege.
[100:44.03]Way too much privilege, Etalyx.
[100:45.61]How did you get this power?
[100:47.79]I guess, yeah, he is a mod.
[100:49.35]I forget that sometimes.
[100:50.17]You are a mod, Etalyx.
[100:51.79]I am a mod.
[100:54.13]Unlimited power.
[101:09.95]What's the TeamSpeak IP?
[101:11.87]That is a private TeamSpeak?
[101:15.17]Only for Scout Voice Actor and Jerma and Etalyx.
[101:20.98]Exclusive.
[101:23.72]Nathan.
[101:25.48]Alright, Chilly, Nathan, Chilly, Nate, like what is like you would like call, if you were to tell me to call you something, call me that.
[101:34.47]You can call me Nathan.
[101:35.93]Just Nathan.
[101:37.07]Most people, most people in the stream do.
[101:38.89]Okay.
[101:39.67]Two.
[101:40.35]Alright.
[101:41.19]I think I asked you that before, but I don't think I stuck with anything, did I?
[101:45.29]If it's any concept, I don't remember.
[101:47.26]Hey, Boo, both of you guys, get the fuck up here.
[101:50.00]Etalyx and Boo, get the fuck up here, what are you doing?
[101:52.40]Come hang out with us.
[101:53.68]I'm not going to be streaming for that much longer.
[101:54.98]Come hang out.
[101:56.42]Come talk a bunch of shit.
[102:00.61]God, are we even friends?
[102:07.69]Oh, my.
[102:10.63]Somebody wants to know if you have any Valve weapons.
[102:12.73]Do you?
[102:13.56]Hi.
[102:14.66]Hi.
[102:15.58]Boo is such a huge fan, by the way.
[102:18.59]I'm such a huge fan.
[102:19.45]Hey dude, how you doing?
[102:20.39]Nice to meet you.
[102:21.23]Hello.
[102:21.47]Hi.
[102:21.53]This is Boo.
[102:24.17]Nice to meet you too.
[102:25.27]This is Boo and Etalyx.
[102:25.97]Nice to meet you, Boo.
[102:26.63]Both content creators, both good dudes.
[102:29.33]Hello, good dude.
[102:29.77]My most played class in TF2 is Scout.
[102:31.59]Why, lots of hours.
[102:33.38]He's my second least played.
[102:35.64]Is he really?
[102:36.08]Yeah, I'm terrible at him.
[102:39.72]I have to wonder what it would be like to play a character that, you know, when you play it all the time, all you can hear is just you.
[102:45.70]I don't know.
[102:46.02]It doesn't really bother me, but it's like... I think it's a voice actor thing.
[102:51.18]I don't know.
[102:52.57]Maybe.
[102:53.09]See, I've always pictured myself voicing a World of Warcraft boss, and then one day going to that raid with my guild and then killing that boss over and over, and I don't know if I'd feel happy or sad that I was killing myself.
[103:05.31]King or 2005 thanks to the resub?
[103:07.29]Oh, boy.
[103:07.59]Yeah, it's... Fuck.
[103:09.45]Like, I understand the moral dilemma that you're facing.
[103:12.25]You thought that was funny?
[103:15.19]But I think you kind of like... You kind of like... It's not you, you know?
[103:18.15]It kind of reminds me of those, like, people who have one famous movie, and then they have seven other movies that they really care about, and then they go to Comic-Con, and they get really mad when you only know them for that one movie.
[103:33.11]What?
[103:33.94]Who reminds you of that?
[103:36.21]This is what we're talking about right now.
[103:37.85]You play the scout, but you're like, I'd rather play this other character instead of my namesake.
[103:45.05]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[103:48.61]It's not so much rather, it's like I legitimately cannot play that character.
[103:52.57]I just get destroyed.
[103:55.65]It's not a choice.
[103:56.75]It's a mechanical deficiency.
[103:58.94]Yeah, you turn a corner, you get killed by a sentry.
[104:01.12]You and Germans should be mortal enemies.
[104:03.58]I just told him that, that an engineer is my favorite class.
[104:06.47]And he was just like, why, you stupid?
[104:11.61]Why?
[104:12.39]There was something along those lines.
[104:13.62]Short and sweet.
[104:14.24]I forget what it was.
[104:15.38]Yeah.
[104:15.82]It summed it up.
[104:19.86]Are you guys surprised that I'm playing Team Fortress 2 again?
[104:23.30]You should be.
[104:24.88]I saw the tweet and I was like, I had to check it out.
[104:27.80]I was real busy at the time too.
[104:29.92]I had to stop exactly what I was doing.
[104:33.10]Overwatch looks old.
[104:36.92]We have a very specific rule on this stream, Etalyx.
[104:40.80]We don't talk about Overwatch and TF2 in the same sentence.
[104:46.74]I didn't mention the other game.
[104:48.32]I just said Overwatch only.
[104:50.18]I'm going to play the other game.
[104:51.84]Guys, I'm going to play the other game.
[104:56.88]That's all there is to it.
[104:59.82]Hey, I'm a mod.
[105:00.58]I'm allowed to say whatever I want.
[105:02.42]The power!
[105:03.36]That privilege can be taken very quickly.
[105:05.92]I can strip that power.
[105:09.21]You know, Ronnie?
[105:10.65]Unmod him.
[105:11.77]He deserves it.
[105:14.04]Does Ronnie have that kind of power?
[105:15.18]How do I make Ronnie the, like, king mod?
[105:17.16]Is it possible?
[105:19.54]Can you make somebody, like, the prince mod?
[105:22.26]You'd have to ask Twitch for that.
[105:23.52]Like, the delineation of mod that's above mod.
[105:26.27]Yeah, what's the mod hierarchy?
[105:28.47]Alright, well, we're about to find out.
[105:31.33]It would probably be either Ronnie or Hypo.
[105:34.61]Or, I don't know, there's, like... We're about to do some science here.
[105:37.95]There's, like, three or four.
[105:38.89]Let me see.
[105:40.55]Who's, like, actually in the...
[105:43.13]There's a good, like, three or four mods that I would say are, like, top dog mod.
[105:47.52]Alright, let's do it.
[105:49.02]We did the round, right?
[105:50.44]Oh, hey, everybody, shut the fuck up.
[105:53.58]Okay, what's... What's the line?
[105:56.00]You're like a car crash in slow motion.
[105:57.23]It's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield.
[105:59.21]You're like a car crash in slow motion.
[106:00.47]It's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield.
[106:01.63]Okay.
[106:03.03]Uh, I gotta take my headset off for this.
[106:05.23]So I won't be able to hear you.
[106:06.95]So let me do it.
[106:07.45]One sec.
[106:09.58]Alright, I gotta warm up real quick.
[106:11.48]So I have to say die hard.
[106:15.33]Glass?
[106:16.27]Who gives a shit about glass?
[106:17.53]Who the fuck is this?
[106:19.87]Oh, you're in charge.
[106:21.35]Well, I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.
[106:22.87]From up here, it doesn't look like you're in charge of Jack shit.
[106:27.96]Fucking awesome.
[106:30.78]You're like a car crash in slow motion.
[106:32.78]It's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield.
[106:36.66]Can we get a round of applause, please?
[106:38.08]Can we get a round of applause?
[106:38.97]That was fucking awesome.
[106:40.68]Yeah, there you go.
[106:42.56]That was quality.
[106:43.46]That was quite the fucking cool shit, dude.
[106:45.25]Cool shit.
[106:45.99]So what you like warm up as, you do like die hard to warm up to do this guy?
[106:50.23]Yeah.
[106:51.09]Yeah.
[106:51.65]That's fucking crazy.
[106:52.65]That's awesome.
[106:53.75]That's where I got the voice from watching Die Hard.
[106:55.77]Oh my god, that's amazing.
[106:59.57]That's some insider info.
[107:00.75]That is some true info.
[107:01.43]Well, I'm putting that straight on the wiki right now.
[107:03.47]Give me a sec.
[107:04.80]Yeah, fill out that wiki page.
[107:08.57]Oh, God.
[107:09.55]You blew up chat.
[107:11.08]Chat blew up.
[107:11.56]Oh, no.
[107:12.90]Chat has exploded.
[107:13.68]I feel bad for the guys to moderate this shit.
[107:20.52]I'm pretty sure they've given up at this point.
[107:22.24]I'm pretty sure it's just all hell broke loose.
[107:24.78]I think most of them are just playing now.
[107:27.21]Yeah, I think that's true, too.
[107:31.96]Are you still on blue?
[107:33.18]Yeah, I'm on blue.
[107:33.76]I'm just playing Medic.
[107:35.20]Medic is a class I can play and stream because I can actually communicate.
[107:39.41]Yeah.
[107:41.47]I'll tell you, this is much harder to stream than Overwatch.
[107:44.74]You think?
[107:45.26]Oh, yeah.
[107:46.95]I mean, it's just because... There's so many more characters.
[107:50.03]There's so much more going on.
[107:51.99]When you die in Overwatch, you can kind of take a second.
[107:54.89]I feel like it's hard to stream TF2 for me because it takes way more of my brain to have to pay attention.
[108:01.28]Well, you also haven't played in a long time.
[108:03.84]That's also true, yeah.
[108:05.51]That's true.
[108:06.15]When it's more familiar, you just kind of turn off and...
[108:10.02]Like, I can't play Roadhog right now, you know what I mean?
[108:13.00]Like, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[108:14.42]It's really like, you're just gonna zone out and play.
[108:17.32]I can't play, like, Roadhog.
[108:19.76]You can't play, like, Mercy and just hold... Well, watch out, 3D Glasses guy, watch out.
[108:27.36]Boo has such a soothing voice, it's lovely.
[108:30.62]Everyone agrees with it.
[108:33.87]That's why Boo should do way more.
[108:36.74]Audio.
[108:38.62]He should read... Boo, when are you going to read another Christmas story?
[108:43.44]Can you just do that?
[108:44.42]I know it's like June, but just do like the Grinch or something.
[108:47.68]You could probably do a pretty good Grinch.
[108:50.34]Someone just said I got the line wrong.
[108:51.74]What's the line?
[108:52.24]Did I not say it right?
[108:54.06]Yeah, you got it right.
[108:56.10]It's like a car crash in slow motion.
[108:58.32]It's like I'm watching you fly through the windshield.
[109:00.42]That's what you said, right?
[109:02.23]Yeah, I think that's right.
[109:04.77]I mean, what?
[109:05.56]Did we miss like an A or an and or a uh?
[109:08.82]Who knows?
[109:09.22]I usually listen to the voice clip before I say them, but... No, that was perfect.
[109:14.36]Perfect.
[109:15.80]Yay!
[109:17.22]Oh, Ronnie, is that... Did I just get killed by top mod?
[109:19.90]Is that what just happened?
[109:22.85]Okay, Ronnie.
[109:24.97]Hypo was like here.
[109:26.27]You were like here.
[109:26.85]You just kind of, you know... You're supposed to be top mod.
[109:30.83]That's not a top mod play.
[109:32.93]That's not a top mod play.
[109:36.07]Just picturing you doing like a top 10 video of your best mod plays.
[109:39.60]Who's the best mod?
[109:41.24]Yeah, like the best bands.
[109:42.68]What a bad video that would be.
[109:44.68]It'd be so fucking awful.
[109:47.82]Who's the best mod in the stream?
[109:50.14]There's something funny about trying to hype it up when it's not hype at all.
[109:56.73]Somebody asked, do you do voice work for other things?
[109:59.79]Me?
[110:00.23]Yeah.
[110:02.83]Not really.
[110:05.24]I was in Left 4 Dead.
[110:07.12]Oh yeah, Ding Dong, right?
[110:09.24]Yeah.
[110:09.88]I remember that guy.
[110:12.11]That guy's a great character.
[110:14.15]Which part is this?
[110:15.29]Left 4 Dead 1 or 2?
[110:16.93]1.
[110:17.25]Yeah, Left 4 Dead 1.
[110:18.61]I forget this.
[110:20.41]He's in the church.
[110:21.11]He rings the bell.
[110:22.87]Oh.
[110:23.09]I haven't played Left 4 Dead in years, but I do remember this.
[110:26.07]Ding Dong.
[110:26.89]Ding Dong.
[110:27.59]Ding Dong.
[110:28.29]I can't do it.
[110:29.15]I can't do the voice.
[110:31.23]Speaking of Left 4 Dead, is this the year?
[110:35.96]Is this the year?
[110:37.00]Is this when they're going to make Leopard a three?
[110:40.20]That's the rumor in the rumor mill.
[110:42.28]I don't know.
[110:43.09]That is a good question.
[110:44.89]I know nothing.
[110:45.57]He knows things.
[110:47.77]Don't listen to him.
[110:48.95]Oh, yeah, good job.
[110:49.67]That's Pocketmatic Barbecue Squid.
[110:52.77]Wait, that's not your name.
[110:53.37]Barbecue Stupid.
[110:54.45]What is it?
[110:54.73]Barbecue Squid?
[110:56.43]Barbecue Squid?
[110:57.17]I just called you Barbecue Squid.
[110:58.91]Is Barbecue Squid a thing?
[111:00.17]I'm sure it is.
[111:02.06]It's probably pretty good.
[111:03.20]But is it a good thing?
[111:04.10]I don't even like squid and I would probably eat it.
[111:06.26]Wow.
[111:08.38]Barbecue adds, like, plus 50 taste to just about anything.
[111:13.54]Yeah, it does.
[111:14.66]It does, you're right.
[111:18.68]When isn't it in the rumor mill?
[111:20.18]That's true, Moss.
[111:21.60]That is true.
[111:22.48]It's always just in the rumor mill.
[111:25.57]And I'm not even punching the fucking...
[111:31.88]I wasn't even hitting it.
[111:33.48]Etalyx, you are not top, bud.
[111:34.92]How dare you.
[111:39.10]That guy used stealth crown.
[111:41.11]I need to, like, go to bed.
[111:42.11]I'm so, like, just... I, like, I had a long fucking day today.
[111:49.35]Can I tell you this?
[111:49.91]Can I tell you?
[111:50.33]Can I tell you guys?
[111:50.87]Can I tell you?
[111:51.27]Let me tell you guys.
[111:52.26]Tell me about your day.
[111:53.72]I had to go... I had to wake up wicked early this morning.
[111:57.50]I had to get a passport.
[112:01.62]Is that it?
[112:02.08]Hold on, somebody's crying.
[112:05.12]Yeah, that's a brutal day.
[112:09.37]Yeah, what a brutal day.
[112:11.63]I had to wake up.
[112:12.57]I had to get a passport.
[112:14.61]Today sucked.
[112:15.33]I had to get a passport.
[112:16.87]Today really sucked.
[112:17.71]I had to wake up.
[112:18.38]No, I fucked it up because I brought in my papers.
[112:21.24]You can get a passport in like two days, right?
[112:23.20]It's easy peasy.
[112:25.16]Uh, if you go to like the agency buildings, right?
[112:27.46]So I go to the building and I'm, I'm walking in with my papers and you know, it's, it's like, it's scary.
[112:31.53]It's like, it's a scary thing because you don't know if the people that, you know, you give them the documents, like, where are you going?
[112:36.85]Oh, I'm going to, uh, XYZ.
[112:39.07]Oh, are you?
[112:40.11]Okay.
[112:40.57]And they like stare at you.
[112:41.75]They look at like your ID and they look at you and they, you need to give them like a birth certificate.
[112:45.21]It's just very, I don't know.
[112:46.53]It's very nerve wracking.
[112:47.43]You feel like I'm gonna throw up the whole time.
[112:50.11]Guilty until proven innocent.
[112:51.83]Yes, but anyways, after that long-winded one-sentence story I just told, I didn't have my right birth certificate.
[113:00.34]You have a different birth certificate?
[113:01.64]I had to go to City Hall in Boston to get my birth certificate.
[113:06.38]I'm jumping around as a spy.
[113:07.86]I'm not playing the game.
[113:08.55]I had to go to City Hall because I was born in Boston.
[113:14.19]Thank God I was actually born in the city.
[113:16.77]Otherwise, I would have been fucked.
[113:20.18]Had to go back.
[113:21.66]Brought that shit back.
[113:24.25]They said okay.
[113:26.87]Train was delayed.
[113:28.37]Didn't tell you that.
[113:29.15]Train was fucking delayed.
[113:31.47]City of fucking Boston, right guys?
[113:34.74]At least you have public transit.
[113:37.54]Yeah, that's true.

[113:51.46]I've been alive for like 21 hours.
[113:53.39]Oh no, everyone's saying show your birth certificate.
[113:57.55]No wonder his birth certificate wasn't right.
[113:59.83]He's only been alive 21 hours.
[114:02.21]Show you a birth certificate.
[114:05.27]Uh, no.

[116:45.73]Okay!
[116:48.20]What should it be about?
[116:48.88]You heard it here?
[116:51.38]Alright, so I got this idea.
[116:52.48]It's fucking Wild West.
[116:54.48]Right.
[116:56.14]And Arnold Schwarzenegger is there.
[116:57.10]I'm waiting for Etalyx to laugh.
[116:58.44]Etalyx should have laughed at that.
[117:01.59]What am I supposed to say?
[117:02.91]I said it's a game.
[117:04.15]I said we're going to make a game.
[117:05.01]It's going to be the Wild West.
[117:08.25]Oh.
[117:08.67]I thought you were going a different direction with that.
[117:10.41]See, the better joke would have been, alright, we're going to make a game.
[117:13.81]It's called Life Sucks.
[117:15.35]Yeah, Life Sucks is a good idea.
[117:21.11]That would have been the one that I got, but now that you've pointed out, I remember what you're talking about.
[117:25.65]And all the video game is, is some way to record your own life.
[117:30.96]And then you watch it back.
[117:31.96]It's just a Snapchat story.
[117:35.12]Yeah.
[117:36.40]It's just a mirror.
[117:38.24]Yeah, it's a fucking mirror.
[117:39.42]That's the game.
[117:40.01]Ooh, I actually got him.
[117:43.88]fuck uh but no that's that's fucking cool are you like a programmer or like a designer yeah I'm a designer that's awesome that's uh right now I do like um uh combatant design it's just like bad guys like ai that's really cool I always wanted to do like game stuff but I'm not good enough at anything
[118:11.83]We would be one of those generic people who think they can work for a game company and just tell other people what to do.
[118:17.01]I'm not good at anything to do with, like, design work at all.
[118:21.54]You're good at collecting subscribers.
[118:24.44]Yeah, I guess I'm kind of good at collecting subscriptions on Twitch.
[118:29.03]Gotta catch them all.
[118:29.89]That's a very practical application for a game design.
[118:33.23]That's very practical.
[118:38.55]Someone just threatened you.
[118:41.37]They said, give us your Snapchat or restart subscribing again.
[118:46.35]You don't want my... I just installed it today.
[118:49.07]Mr. Pinky, thanks for three months.
[118:51.65]I just downloaded it today.
[118:53.91]You don't need it.
[118:55.15]Maybe eventually.
[118:56.73]Maybe I'll do a sub Snapchat thing.
[118:59.07]Once a month I'll take a nude.
[119:03.53]That's a joke.
[119:04.23]That's a joke.
[119:05.35]It's a joke.
[119:06.59]It's only going to be once every three months.
[119:09.13]It's not going to be every month.
[119:10.73]By the way, you misheard me.
[119:11.89]I would take a picture.
[119:12.99]I would take a newt.
[119:14.31]N-E-W-T.
[119:15.25]Please, guys.
[119:15.93]Get your mind out of the gutter.
[119:18.75]It's a... Are newts amphibians?
[119:23.76]Yeah.
[119:24.90]No, don't want to kill me with this.
[119:26.34]Fuck!
[119:29.80]Not a joke.
[119:30.30]That was a joke.
[119:33.50]You ain't getting any of my nudes.
[119:35.78]The joke was only one a month.
[119:39.84]I get way more than that.
[119:42.97]You know what's funny?
[119:45.01]I'm going to cut this off.
[119:46.83]I'm just going to cut it off.
[119:48.79]Have you ever seen me naked?
[119:52.34]I feel like all my friends have seen me naked at least once.
[119:56.62]I have an Uber.
[119:57.64]Uh... Maybe.
[119:59.50]It's a little... It's a little... It's a little... The memory is a little fuzzy.
[120:05.48]Hey, Star has seen me naked.
[120:10.48]Is that supposed to be news?
[120:14.48]He's just trying to make you jealous.
[120:15.48]Anybody that's here, watching TF2 gameplay, I'm so fucking goddamn sorry that you're here watching this right now.
[120:20.48]This is- this is a travesty of gameplay.
[120:25.48]This is the Jerma talks and walks into enemies stream.
[120:29.56]I hope it was worth it.
[120:33.71]Oh, we actually got to hear cool shit, too.
[120:36.29]Come on, let me just, like, fucking... Yeah, I got it.
[120:41.97]Alright, boo.
[120:43.63]Let me ask you something.
[120:46.14]Why are you popping your chest like that?
[120:47.64]You're making me nervous.
[120:48.68]Let me ask you something.
[120:50.20]No.
[120:50.96]Don't.
[120:51.60]I'm asking.
[120:52.87]It's late.
[120:53.43]My brain is not all quite... How big... Oh, what?
[120:57.65]Gosh.
[120:57.99]How big is your heart?
[121:03.08]Pretty goddamn big.
[121:06.46]I have a heart this size.
[121:08.52]Sorry, what was that?
[121:10.30]What did you say?
[121:11.06]I was gonna say, trumpet.
[121:13.59]Thanks a lot, entrance.
[121:15.91]Welcome, entrance.
[121:17.29]Trumpets are very noble.
[121:17.87]I thought you were gonna say, my heart's as big as my dick.
[121:22.32]Trumpets are very noble, so...
[121:26.52]You know, if you had a trumpet-sized heart, you'd have a very noble... They're also brass, which rhymes with ass.
[121:35.66]That is potentially true.
[121:37.96]I'll have to look into that.
[121:38.84]Oh, this thing is going to be funny.
[121:44.48]Nah, it's not going to be funny.
[121:45.37]Never mind.
[121:50.09]Alright, it is currently 2.15 in the morning.
[121:53.53]I'm probably gonna play like one or two more rounds and then I'm going to go collapse in my bed because it's been a long, long, long day.
[122:02.30]Oh, you think it's late?
[122:03.48]Why don't you ask Boo if it's late?
[122:05.76]Hey, that's a good idea.
[122:08.08]I'm gonna fuck off.
[122:10.90]It was a pleasure.
[122:11.72]I'm actually gonna leave now.
[122:13.53]What?
[122:13.99]Did you scare Boo away?
[122:15.79]I didn't mean to.
[122:16.63]I made him look at the clock.
[122:18.64]You actually scared our good friend Boo away, didn't you?
[122:22.62]Is he gone?
[122:24.15]No, but I am going.
[122:25.73]Okay.
[122:26.73]Bye-bye, folks.
[122:27.35]It was fun.
[122:28.39]Yeah, thanks for coming.
[122:28.93]Yeah, it was nice meeting you.
[122:30.41]You too, dude.
[122:31.35]Have a good one.
[122:32.25]See you, Boo.
[122:32.61]See you around.
[122:33.01]Yeah, Boo.
[122:34.01]He's already gone.
[122:35.47]Say bye.
[122:38.26]I didn't mean to.
[122:38.96]You sure fucked that up.
[122:41.15]Okay.
[122:42.51]Etalyx should really drop the ball on that one, I'm just not gonna lie.
[122:45.63]We could've had- we could've had Boo's sexy voice in here for at least another, like, 10 to 20 minutes.
[122:51.77]He has a great voice.
[122:53.19]Yeah, he does.
[122:53.77]I am so sorry.
[123:00.26]I forgot his one weakness is the clock.
[123:02.90]Yeah, looking at the clock is the thing he can't handle.
[123:08.00]Snapchat, I can't even talk.
[123:10.38]Snapchat, sneak peek.
[123:13.94]7.15 a.m.
[123:14.36]How do you use Snapchat?
[123:15.20]How does it work?
[123:16.82]You take a picture and you accidentally send it to everyone that's following you.
[123:20.62]Okay.
[123:21.12]And then you just wait.
[123:25.48]And then things happen.
[123:27.05]Yeah.
[123:30.15]That's when the real magic begins.
[123:33.95]Then you probably make sure it's only set up one way so other people can't use it.
[123:38.14]Did I play Army Grog?
[123:39.12]Yes, I did.
[123:40.18]Otherwise it's dick pics.
[123:42.84]I streamed all of Army Grog from start to finish.
[123:48.80]Bad idea.
[123:49.66]Really bad idea.
[123:50.94]Is that you with the saw?
[123:52.58]Yeah, it was me.
[123:58.97]Bug Catcher Varms.
[124:00.91]Thanks a lot, dude.
[124:01.37]Welcome.
[124:04.90]I'm doing some lip licking right now.
[124:06.38]I need to moisturize.
[124:09.10]It's getting bad.
[124:13.28]Well, good night, Squishy.
[124:14.14]Thanks for coming, man.
[124:15.98]Hope you enjoyed the stream, as they say.
[124:21.78]Alright, where is anybody?
[124:23.38]I need to give this to somebody.
[124:24.06]You're on the other team.
[124:25.26]I'm still on the other team.
[124:26.54]Have you been on the other team for the last 65 days?
[124:29.80]Yes.
[124:31.22]Well, whatever.
[124:37.28]Getting stuck, getting stuck, getting stuck.
[124:40.34]I want to hear more about the Bungie stuff.
[124:41.90]Is it stuff you can talk about or stuff you can't talk about?
[124:44.82]No, I can't actually.
[124:45.82]Okay.
[124:47.11]I can't actually talk about a lot of that.
[124:49.29]Alright, that's fine.
[124:52.49]Sworn to secrecy.
[124:54.65]What about in the past?
[124:57.43]I actually just started there.
[124:59.46]Oh.
[125:01.16]I think I just finished my first month.
[125:04.34]Really?
[125:04.62]Yeah, that's brand new.
[125:06.94]We just gotta keep prying and we can get them fired.
[125:08.95]Do they watch your streams or anything like that?
[125:12.97]God, I hope not.
[125:15.27]Oh, one of those situations.
[125:19.25]I'm much more professional at work than I am on stream.
[125:21.71]Are you one of the people in their Twitter profile?
[125:23.44]What I say is not representative of Bungie.
[125:26.26]I haven't put that up there, but they recommend it.
[125:27.94]How can I not kill you?
[125:29.78]God.
[125:32.97]My thoughts are my own and my opinions are mine.
[125:35.31]I honestly, like, they do recommend you put that on your stuff.
[125:39.38]I probably should.
[125:39.98]I am an idiot and Bungie does not approve of what I say.
[125:42.70]My thoughts are mine and mine alone.
[125:48.28]How long am I going to stream for?
[125:49.32]For maybe another five to ten minutes after this round.
[125:51.90]I think it's going to be done.
[125:54.62]I need to... I have to cook some food too.
[125:57.58]I haven't done that either.
[125:59.64]I'm a train wreck today.
[126:01.18]What a train wreck.
[126:01.96]Make a nice peanut butter and jelly.
[126:06.74]Hey, that one guy ate 31, thank you.
[126:09.28]You're Mr. Fish right now.
[126:10.63]Thank you so much for coming out.
[126:12.95]And... Potentially... Potentially... Mm-hmm.
[126:22.13]Got really quiet.
[126:25.09]It was a hard name.
[126:25.63]Because I fucking can't talk.
[126:29.23]I thought my internet died for a second, actually.
[126:34.13]Jeremy, you look kawaii.
[126:36.20]Thank you.
[126:37.54]My waifu.
[126:40.06]Aww, am I?
[126:41.62]That's so sweet of you, Etalyx.
[126:48.99]More than a feeling.
[126:50.97]Something like that, right?
[126:57.05]Yeah.
[126:58.37]Exactly.
[127:11.29]Come on.
[127:11.79]Don't let them win.
[127:13.11]I know.
[127:13.39]I alarm you, and I'm pushing the cart.
[127:16.27]No!
[127:16.89]He's dead.
[127:17.87]And so am I. Bye.
[127:22.00]I'm gonna play Sniper and I'm gonna just be bad for the remainder of the run.
[127:30.30]Is this real life?
[127:31.60]They haven't done one in a while.
[127:34.42]Yeah, I don't know.
[127:35.42]The next big one coming out is the competitive stuff, I think.
[127:40.21]Is matchmaking technically still in beta?
[127:42.91]Yeah.
[127:45.85]I haven't tried it though.
[127:46.64]I have the ticket thing too, but I haven't tried it.
[127:49.96]Should I hit him in the head?
[127:52.54]I'm not gonna fucking get humiliated when my stream ends.
[128:03.11]Do you feel like you've been able to assess the state of the game or your opinions on it?
[128:06.99]Or has it just been pretty much subscriber stream still?
[128:10.23]Honestly, the last like hour and a half has kind of just been a blur.
[128:14.04]I'm not gonna lie.
[128:16.49]I just was... He really killed me.
[128:23.38]You have points somehow.
[128:27.24]How?
[128:27.70]I don't know.
[128:33.56]You're on the board.
[128:36.46]Yeah, that's my purple range.
[128:38.28]The one thing I'm good for right now.
[128:39.78]Wait, what?
[128:40.56]I have a purple range.
[128:42.22]And is Muse Elk watching the stream right now?
[128:46.11]Muse Elk, three months.
[128:49.21]Muse Elk is one of the secret keepers, by the way, guys.
[128:51.03]If you don't know what that... We're getting destroyed.
[128:54.59]Secret keepers?
[128:55.50]We're getting fucking destroyed.
[128:56.48]Am I a secret keeper?
[128:58.86]Yes, you are.
[128:59.70]Etalyx is a secret keeper.
[129:01.68]Oh?
[129:02.98]Who is a secret keeper?
[129:04.07]Star is a secret keeper?
[129:04.79]Not even I know the secret.
[129:07.09]Who else have I told?
[129:08.57]I told a bunch of random fucking people at PAX.
[129:12.89]I definitely shouldn't have.
[129:14.01]That was a mistake.
[129:14.75]I was just like, hey, everybody, guess what?
[129:16.63]I just had to tell somebody.
[129:20.75]I'm moving to America.
[129:22.38]I'm finally moving to America.
[129:26.46]I'm a real boy.
[129:29.66]Who's this Pyro?
[129:31.54]No.
[129:32.36]No, no, no.
[129:33.61]Stop that.
[129:36.37]Is this a spy, or what is... Hold on a second, I need to... There we are.
[129:51.18]Uh...
[129:58.33]Cronkidile?
[130:00.89]Did Cronkidile just subscribe to my twitch.tv stream?
[130:06.57]It doesn't matter what I do.
[130:07.31]I walk out and die.
[130:09.22]What's up, Cronkidile?
[130:09.90]Thanks a lot, man.
[130:10.98]Hope all is well.
[130:13.34]Hope life is treating you well, my friend.
[130:18.28]I'm using your now mod, so don't abuse your power, please.
[130:23.18]Or just abuse the shit out of it.
[130:24.99]I could care less.
[130:26.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one.
[130:32.55]I swear to God, I feel like I'm playing a Nauta game.
[130:34.82]I'm not playing TF2 right now.
[130:35.84]I'm playing, like, open a door and die the game.
[130:41.72]It's The Stanley Parable.
[130:43.28]Yeah, I'm just playing Stanley Parable.
[130:45.60]That is a perfect way to describe it.
[130:51.20]I'm going to play a character that won't die instantly when he walks out of a door.
[130:54.66]Spy and stealth?
[130:56.74]Uh, heavy.
[130:58.74]You'll probably still die.
[131:00.41]Yeah, probably.
[131:01.45]But at least it won't be as quick.
[131:05.07]Still pretty quick.
[131:09.66]It was still pretty quick.
[131:12.42]It was pretty quick.
[131:13.34]But you got out of the door.
[131:15.46]Thankfully, I did get out of the door.
[131:16.86]You're right.
[131:17.92]And when you're right, you're right.
[131:19.70]And you, you're always right.
[131:22.22]Spaceballs, the movie.
[131:27.20]Alright, guys.
[131:27.78]Uh, I... Oh, no.
[131:30.18]Oh, no.
[131:30.84]That's what... Oh, my God.
[131:32.68]Oh, my God.
[131:33.12]Oh, my God.
[131:33.44]Oh, my God.
[131:33.78]Mr. Slinn is streaming.
[131:34.98]Everybody.
[131:35.93]Everybody, hold on a second.
[131:36.91]Chill the fuck out for a second, everybody.
[131:39.05]Don't move.
[131:39.95]Don't move a muscle.
[131:41.79]We are going to raid the absolute fuck out of Mr. Slinn right now, okay?
[131:47.99]I don't know what a raid is.
[131:50.61]They know what a raid is.
[131:51.40]We've raided.
[131:53.38]So here's where you're going to go.
[131:54.42]You're going to go to Mr. Slim's Twitch right now.
[131:57.28]He's streaming right now.
[131:58.08]I think he's doing sixes.
[131:59.20]He's doing 6v6.
[132:02.02]Here's his... What emote do we spam?
[132:06.31]The moon, of course.
[132:08.70]Everybody, right now, go to Mr. Slin.
[132:13.08]Go there.
[132:14.54]Raid Mr. Slin.
[132:16.74]Get him, boy.
[132:17.68]And hey, tell him Jerma sent you.
[132:20.96]Tell him Jerma sent you.
[132:23.72]And that's going to wrap it up, guys.
[132:26.22]Thank you so much, everybody, for watching.
[132:27.46]I'm going to do a heart-to-heart here with everybody.
[132:31.12]I'll talk to you guys in a little bit.
[132:33.54]Again, Nathan, thank you for coming out and being part of the stream.
[132:36.88]Yeah, it was cool meeting you.
[132:38.11]Yeah, thanks for having me.
[132:38.87]It was fun.
[132:39.17]Please put your social media and shit in the chat, your Twitch, where you can find you.
[132:44.05]Sure, thanks.
[132:44.65]Follow Nathan, please.
[132:46.41]He's a fucking great streamer, great caster.
[132:48.82]Etalyx?
[132:49.20]You guys know Etalyx.
[132:50.20]It's Etalyx.
[132:51.24]He's the man.
[132:52.40]I'm just that guy, yeah.
[132:54.98]Raid Mr. Slim, everybody.
[132:56.50]Let him know that you love him.
[132:58.96]I'm going to duck out for a second.
[133:00.10]I'll talk to you guys later.
[133:04.45]Okay.
[133:04.81]Before I end the stream, I just want to say we're going to go full screen for this one.
[133:09.49]That was fucking crazy.
[133:11.03]That was unbelievable.
[133:12.29]I've never experienced something like that.
[133:15.03]Ever.
[133:15.47]In the whole time I've been on Twitch.
[133:16.69]So... Thank you so fucking much to all the people that subscribed in that huge chain.
[133:22.67]That was truly... I have no words.
[133:25.39]I don't know how to take that type of shit.
[133:28.51]And look at... I'm like sweating.
[133:30.49]I'm tired.
[133:31.71]I'm ready for bed.
[133:32.63]But... I love you guys all.
[133:34.87]Thank you so much for doing that.
[133:35.95]That you didn't have to.
[133:36.69]There was no reason to do it.
[133:38.10]But...
[133:39.46]I salute you all.
[133:40.34]I'm sorry I couldn't get everybody's name.
[133:41.78]I couldn't read everybody's fucking name and shit, but much love regardless.
[133:46.40]So head over to Slim's channel.
[133:49.07]Tell him that you think he's a great medic and that didn't give him some moons.
[133:53.65]So good night, guys.
[133:55.33]Take care.
[133:56.39]I'll see you later.
[133:57.89]Goodbye.
