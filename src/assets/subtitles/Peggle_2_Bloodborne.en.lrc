[ve:60.16.100]

[00:15.27]I just scared the shit out of so many people.
[00:17.23]I'm so sorry.
[00:19.05]It just was so loud.
[00:20.01]I'm so sorry about that.
[00:21.45]But anyways, hey look!
[01:50.42]Well, hopefully this works.
[01:52.60]Don't ask me what that was all about.
[01:54.20]But anyways, hi.
[01:55.08]Welcome back.
[01:56.88]Welcome back this time.
[02:00.44]Please let it die.
[02:02.26]We'll play that after this.
[02:03.93]Let's move on here.
[02:04.99]And...
[02:18.61]Oh, come on.
[02:20.22]Yay!
[02:23.96]Just gonna play some Peggle and be sick.
[02:28.50]Sorry about that.
[02:29.42]I wasn't anticipating my computer to suck.
[02:34.46]But it's alright.
[02:34.88]We're not even streaming from my computer anymore.
[02:39.10]We're streaming from my PlayStation 4.
[02:40.88]So we don't have to worry about our piece of shit 4770K not being able to handle the Hitman update.
[02:51.15]Something to do with the snow or how that is rendered or something.
[02:54.73]I guess my computer can't handle it.
[02:58.11]And it can play every other mission in the game.
[03:03.66]24 hour stream.
[03:04.54]Actually, this is going to be good because I can just chill and play Peggle.
[03:07.96]We can talk about stuff.
[03:08.92]We can hang out.
[03:10.48]I missed a bunch of subs too during that whole thing.
[03:14.16]So thank you for subbing, everybody, over the course of that.
[03:17.37]I'm not sure if I can get to everybody.
[03:18.61]Let's see.
[03:18.97]Tungsten Spartan, Tom Bombad, thanks for the eight months.
[03:22.55]ItGoff, thanks for eight months.
[03:23.93]FeelBetter985, thanks, man.
[03:26.47]TheChangsta, Dyrantheus, Plumblue, FunkyTown, or FunkyTunk, thanks for four months.
[03:33.84]PhillyQ, DarkAxe, Lanet22, NoodlesForNerds, and JiveTalkingPanda, thanks a lot, guys.
[03:41.53]Felix, thanks for the bits.
[03:44.16]Sam gave $500.
[03:44.82]Yeah, you guys gave some money there, too.
[03:48.40]I'm just a sick, bad piece of shit streamer.
[03:52.79]And I'm not feeling well, so let's play some Peggle.
[03:55.55]What do you say, guys?
[03:59.53]I can't believe I'm actually playing Peggle right now.
[04:04.43]We have to try to 100% stuff.
[04:05.80]I don't even know what this guy's power was.
[04:09.86]Thank you, Jorah the Explorer.
[04:13.38]Am I going to do a makeup tutorial this weekend?
[04:16.62]No, I'm doing a makeup stream.
[04:25.25]I have your attention.
[04:25.91]I am Norman.
[04:30.27]Okay, Norman.
[04:30.89]Hitman doesn't work.
[04:32.21]Yeah, I don't know what the hell was going on with it.
[04:35.73]Last for one shot.
[04:36.45]Uber vault.
[04:36.98]Yeah.
[04:39.24]Let me, uh... Options...
[04:43.10]Let's just bring the sound down a little bit.
[04:47.30]Well, that didn't work.
[04:48.70]Yeah, it did.
[04:51.29]Ah!
[04:52.41]Alright, let's go for some trick shots here.
[04:55.31]Haven't seen Peggle in forever.
[04:58.93]Peggle 2 is especially... Especially annoying that it didn't really come out on PC until a long way away from when it released initially.
[05:07.43]What does this thing do again?
[05:09.87]It shoots like an electro-zapper?
[05:14.16]Pretty good.
[05:14.60]Pretty decent.
[05:18.08]Ooh, 50,000 points and get in the basket.
[05:23.43]Absolutely touching that this sick boy is able to still enjoy things around him.
[05:26.75]Like a good game of Peggle 2.
[05:27.85]That is true.
[05:30.10]At least I can enjoy Peggle 2.
[05:33.30]Doesn't burn my CPU into the ground.
[05:38.18]Get in the bucket.
[05:42.73]Thanks, Good Burger, for the three months in DHM.
[05:45.11]Coolboy and Jorah the Explorer.
[05:46.25]I think I got you, Jorah, already.
[05:47.17]I did.
[05:49.17]High skill gameplay.
[05:54.09]If you wanted to come to a stream to see a guy clear every single fucking peg, you came to the right place.
[06:08.64]I'll get all the oranges.
[06:09.92]I got plenty of balls left.
[06:11.06]And I got this super ball.
[06:13.15]Alright, let's go with the... How do you do the finesse?
[06:14.71]Is it L1?
[06:15.09]Yeah, it's L1 and R1.
[06:17.67]I want to get it, like, right in there.
[06:24.35]High octane.
[06:27.17]I love how that one guy just fail fished.
[06:28.69]He's like, fuck this.
[06:32.47]That wasn't even a good shot.
[06:33.52]Fuck you, guy.
[06:37.16]What's the lore here?
[06:37.80]I don't know what the lore would be with this guy.
[06:39.56]We might be able to actually get them all.
[06:42.64]Come on!
[06:47.32]Let's clear these ones.
[06:51.68]It's gonna be close.
[06:54.20]If I get these two together... Yep.
[06:57.45]Do it!
[07:00.21]Shit.
[07:00.75]Come on, I gotta get these both.
[07:03.09]Alright, let's try to go... Get in the bucket!
[07:08.39]Get in the bucket!
[07:09.71]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[07:11.83]Unbelievable.
[07:17.84]Oh, he's going to get it.
[07:19.12]He's going to get it.
[07:20.64]Two balls left.
[07:21.48]Easy.
[07:22.75]With an extra ball.
[07:23.53]Come on.
[07:24.73]Oh, don't miss this shot.
[07:26.15]You'll be a fucking sad man if you miss this one.
[07:29.31]I fucking missed it.
[07:35.09]Okay, hold on.
[07:36.33]Hold on a second.
[07:37.71]Okay.
[07:38.77]I almost missed it again.
[07:39.57]I almost missed it again.
[07:42.86]Get in that hard thousand.
[07:44.18]Oh, man.
[07:52.88]It's a good thing I didn't choke there, though.
[07:58.70]350?
[07:58.74]I got... Dude, um... I'll take all the optional objectives, please.
[08:02.60]Thank you very much!
[08:03.80]Alright.
[08:09.82]My heart's kind of beating a little faster.
[08:11.35]I don't think my heart would get this high.
[08:13.89]Plank Peggle, too.
[08:14.71]Okay, there's little bungee jumpies here.
[08:26.67]So shit, it's fine.
[08:28.93]There's a lot of, you know, I think I can just... Let's try to bounce it off this one and down the hole.
[08:35.31]Come on, give me a slide.
[08:37.66]Give me a gopher slide.
[08:39.10]Come on.
[08:41.38]Holy shit.
[08:43.38]You just did one of those emotes, one of the super emotes.
[08:47.08]I want to go see that.
[08:48.94]Shadow Vaults with the $100 cheer emote.
[08:53.10]Look at that fucking thing.
[08:54.66]That's insanity.
[09:00.25]A hundred bucks, dude.
[09:03.26]Thank you.
[09:08.20]I just looked over and I saw this guy's mouth going in and opening and screaming.
[09:16.22]Oh, come on.
[09:18.26]That's very kind of you, dude.
[09:23.54]Merry Christmas.
[09:25.25]Happy holidays.
[09:25.99]Thanks a lot, man.
[09:29.01]I hope you're enjoying this high-octane peggle play.
[09:33.83]Did I even hit anything?
[09:35.49]Did I miss everything?
[09:37.21]I'm gonna have to lose this one.
[09:39.85]Right there.
[09:41.43]Come on.
[09:42.39]That's a lot of dog shit.
[09:46.56]I'm trying to slide it.
[09:51.84]I gotta make this count.
[09:53.34]I'm gonna go this way with it.
[10:00.25]Give me an extra ball.
[10:00.87]Come on!
[10:01.41]Extra ball!
[10:04.37]Terrible shot.
[10:08.30]I don't think I'm gonna get this.
[10:11.04]Oh my fucking god.
[10:13.58]It's cause I'm sick.
[10:14.50]I don't feel good today.
[10:18.30]And that was just the bait right there for this to be like the best fucking peggle shot you've ever seen.
[10:23.22]Look at all those oranges I just got.
[10:25.14]Can I get a free ball too?
[10:25.96]Just kidding.
[10:29.11]Alright, we're gonna go down here with this.
[10:36.21]Oof.
[10:37.78]Free ball.
[10:38.34]Alright, we got five to get.
[10:44.08]Get those two.
[10:44.74]Come on, you fucking stupid braid.
[10:46.58]These braids are really killing me here.
[10:51.92]Alright, I can get it.
[10:53.08]I got one more.
[10:53.88]I gotta sneak it in there.
[10:55.73]Right there.
[10:57.01]One, two, three, shoot.
[11:00.19]Best peggle player you've ever seen in your life.
[11:05.01]You find me another peggle player that can do a shot like that and I'll give you a fucking hundred.
[11:10.64]I'll give you a fucking hundred bottle caps.
[11:18.02]That was pretty bad.
[11:18.94]Sorry.
[11:21.30]Yeah, this is like... I just kind of got depressed and sad.
[11:26.59]That I couldn't play Hitman and do the holiday mission because my computer sucks.
[11:31.75]Apparently.
[11:34.51]So... We're doing the stream joke from three days ago.
[11:40.52]Except it's not a joke.
[11:41.38]I'm actually doing it.
[11:44.14]I fucked that one up, sorry.
[11:46.08]Oh, this is gonna be so satisfying.
[11:47.40]Watch this one.
[11:50.75]Come on.
[11:52.03]Look at this.
[11:53.45]Oh, come on!
[11:55.65]I gotta, like, get it.
[11:56.71]Oh!
[11:57.09]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:58.57]Retry.
[12:02.29]No, retry again.
[12:05.28]There we go.
[12:10.14]I wanted to be a wicked bad cheater.
[12:11.34]I don't think it's gonna work, though.
[12:19.43]Sometimes you gotta cheat Sometimes how do you speed up time?
[12:28.06]What's the time speed up select start?
[12:29.70]Go for a super slide here see that slide into the bucket Extreme jokes except every time he makes a joke.
[12:44.40]He's serious No, not necessarily
[12:51.45]Get it right in the butt cheeks.
[12:52.46]That's a double.
[12:56.52]So, how's everybody's week going?
[12:58.14]Good?
[13:00.18]Hope it's going well.
[13:02.46]Besides being sick, it's been a pretty decent... Dude, I am just a free ball master right now.
[13:10.25]I don't think anybody can compare to my free balling skills.
[13:14.29]Get in the bucket!
[13:17.05]Get in the bucket!
[13:18.95]Oh, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
[13:22.63]That's unfortunate.
[13:28.10]Get in the bucket.
[13:30.80]Oh shit, but you made it look pretty good.
[13:35.46]Are you looking for a Peggle 2 team?
[13:38.80]Back in my old YouTube days, when I would watch YouTube videos... I say back in my old YouTube days like it was... that long ago.
[13:48.80]I'm used to watching videos of people get like the insane shots like that.
[13:54.76]I think there was a YouTube video of a guy clearing every single peg on a certain level in one shot and it was like insane.
[14:04.32]Alright, we got some opportunity here to get everything.
[14:08.26]Let's try it.
[14:13.22]Was that right?
[14:17.74]Come on, come on!
[14:26.47]I love looking over and seeing the PogChamps.
[14:29.23]It just feels so right, you know?
[14:33.61]There we go, it's square.
[14:34.53]I don't want to hit that one.
[14:36.40]I've got plenty of balls left.
[14:42.52]Got to go for the points.
[14:43.26]Because it might be a possibility that if you go for the points, then you'll get an extra ball.
[14:54.98]No!
[14:56.78]Oh, well.
[14:57.16]It's okay.
[15:00.92]What are you getting?
[15:01.54]Get in the hundred.
[15:04.23]So calculated.
[15:06.69]Thank you, space swap, for your three months.
[15:08.07]Wow, is that just a...
[15:12.96]Also, thank you to Sandwich Man for the bits and ACG Schmuck for nine months.
[15:17.78]Thanks, dude.
[15:20.72]When did I get sick?
[15:21.98]A couple days ago.
[15:24.82]And you know I'm sick because I go like this.
[15:28.62]Get one extreme slide shot.
[15:30.44]Oh, look at that.
[15:32.28]There's an opportunity for us to get an extreme slide.
[15:35.10]I gotta get this right.
[15:41.42]I'll get it.
[15:41.78]I wish this could get out of the way.
[15:50.79]Come on!
[15:53.21]Sometimes you gotta cheat to win.
[15:54.79]We'll go this side.
[15:57.91]This side's probably a bit better for me.
[16:03.09]I'll get out of the fucking way.
[16:06.86]Come on!
[16:07.82]Come on!
[16:10.68]That's bullshit.
[16:16.82]That's what I'm talking about, extreme slide, baby.
[16:21.61]What?
[16:22.73]Oh shit, let's just do it again.
[16:25.87]God damn it.
[16:30.13]It's not cheating, it's winning.
[16:31.31]I don't know what the hell is going on over there.
[16:37.43]Bounce, bounce.
[16:41.25]I think I can get one over here, too.
[16:42.42]No, not quite.
[16:46.08]I don't think I'm going to get this one, even with that extreme slide.
[16:53.78]Give me a free ball.
[16:56.29]Come on!
[16:56.89]Where are the free balls at, man?
[16:58.05]I'm going to make this one really count if I have any chance.
[17:01.23]No, I actually have this.
[17:07.00]Oh, you dog shit-eater.
[17:08.76]Where are my free balls?
[17:13.90]Sneak this one down there.
[17:15.06]Come on.
[17:15.36]Give me the two orange ones.
[17:16.98]Get in the bucket at least.
[17:20.20]So snowy.
[17:21.81]What is this ice cold thing that I keep seeing in the chat?
[17:24.87]Is that like a new emote or something?
[17:26.13]A new like better twitch.tv thing?
[17:28.17]Two balls left.
[17:32.09]Get over there.
[17:33.54]Get in the bucket at least.
[17:35.26]I just like broke my neck turning it around.
[17:37.50]Last ball.
[17:40.68]No, I gotta go down here.
[17:45.69]That's how you get it done.
[17:47.41]That's how you get it done.
[17:49.83]This is how you get it done.
[17:51.59]Shit.
[17:53.11]This is how you get it done, guys.
[17:54.75]You ready?
[17:56.59]You guys ready to get it done?
[17:59.13]I'm ready to get it done!
[18:00.25]That didn't happen.
[18:03.75]Pretend that didn't happen.
[18:04.47]That was a joke.
[18:05.81]I'm glad it was that funny.
[18:06.71]It's gotta be up here.
[18:17.00]I didn't even get the green.
[18:18.04]That was the problem.
[18:19.72]I didn't get the green that time.
[18:23.84]That's all that happened.
[18:24.68]It's alright.
[18:29.90]Ooh, extreme slider!
[18:35.27]Get in the bucket, too.
[18:35.95]Come on.
[18:37.89]That's a much better start.
[18:42.55]Double choke.
[18:47.54]That was good.
[18:49.60]I'll scoop up these.
[18:50.56]No, no, no.
[18:50.96]We're going over this side.
[18:52.70]There's much more over this side.
[18:53.84]It's alright.
[18:59.80]I guess I could launch them off that way, too.
[19:01.50]I probably should be doing it like that.
[19:04.23]Oh, fuck you, game.
[19:07.31]Change the stream title.
[19:08.09]The stream title is changed.
[19:09.17]If you refresh the page, I'm sure you'll probably see it.
[19:19.07]Unless for some reason Twitch didn't want to update it.
[19:22.31]Do I play RPGs?
[19:23.73]Uh, yeah.
[19:26.73]I play any game that I think I'll like.
[19:29.19]Actually, you know.
[19:30.47]That was awesome, but too bad it didn't go in.
[19:31.95]Let's try to get point.
[19:38.84]Let's skim the point ball.
[19:41.64]Down to the oranges.
[19:44.46]Perfect.
[19:44.80]Come on.
[19:45.66]More oranges.
[19:51.32]What am I, like a French guy?
[20:00.62]Always followed up with fucking something awful, right?
[20:03.76]Always.
[20:14.65]Just make sure we get the job done.
[20:22.09]PogChamp right into the failfish.
[20:23.89]It's great.
[20:26.59]Oh, come on.
[20:27.85]God damn it.
[20:29.57]I just want to get this one stupid ball.
[20:32.31]Oh my fucking god.
[20:34.82]What a disaster.
[20:36.26]Needs to be lower.
[20:46.80]I guaranteed we'll get it.
[20:49.43]Oh, no.
[20:49.69]Actually, no.
[20:50.03]This thing's in the way.
[20:51.99]Get everything... Get all the stump shit out of the way, and I'll be fine.
[20:56.53]Rollercoaster of emotions.
[21:02.86]Alright.
[21:04.04]I have one chance to not fuck this up.
[21:05.52]I just have to shoot it in this exact same spot.
[21:13.78]Tenant asks, thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[21:16.57]Important question considering you're a man who drinks a lot of coffee.
[21:18.95]I want to know if I'm not alone.
[21:20.79]Does coffee make you pee smell weird?
[21:26.94]Uh... I don't... I don't think so.
[21:30.40]Nothing I'm aware of.
[21:35.72]Incoming trial.
[21:36.68]Oh.
[21:38.51]Zap him!
[21:40.27]Zap him.
[21:40.71]Alright.
[21:43.63]I'll cast some zaps.
[21:46.07]Use one uber vault shot to zap the blocked orange peg.
[21:53.25]What?
[21:53.93]I don't understand.
[21:54.47]I don't get... What?
[21:57.68]I don't get it.
[21:58.10]Do I just need to... Oh, okay.
[22:02.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:04.36]I get it.
[22:04.74]Watch.
[22:05.44]Easy.
[22:05.92]Easy.
[22:08.96]Actually, this ain't gonna be easy.
[22:11.95]Come on.
[22:12.59]Get it.
[22:14.86]It has to bounce up and then hit it.
[22:16.92]Oh, man.
[22:23.80]What if I just hit it directly?
[22:25.63]Alright, I just was playing chess.
[22:29.11]I thought I had to bounce it off the bottom into the top.
[22:31.43]I don't know why I was playing chess right there.
[22:33.73]I said to play checkers.
[22:34.53]That was dumb.
[22:42.13]Yeah, that was easy.
[22:42.79]I just like... I thought I had to bounce it up from the bottom.
[22:48.19]What were the objectives here?
[22:55.39]Get 50,000 points in one shot.
[22:58.23]Sounds like a plan, sir.
[23:05.72]That wasn't in the way.
[23:06.62]Actually, this would be good.
[23:07.88]If I can do this correctly.
[23:09.02]Let's see how correctly I can do it.
[23:13.80]pretty correctly.
[23:15.34]I would call that correct.
[23:19.11]Check out Crypt of the NecroDancer.
[23:23.97]That might be a little too much for my brain.
[23:25.29]I'm not really into rhythm games too much.
[23:33.91]That was not good.
[23:34.85]I can't really sneak it in there now.
[23:39.19]Come on.
[23:40.89]Get in the bucket.
[23:48.99]There's actually... No, let's just go for it.
[23:52.69]Oh, fuck me.
[23:54.08]Really?
[23:55.10]That was dumb.
[23:58.58]So was that.
[23:59.08]I should have waited.
[24:06.33]In the bucket?
[24:07.07]No!
[24:08.87]Well, I'm in deep trouble here.
[24:10.45]I need to get rid of these things.
[24:13.69]They're in the way.
[24:14.21]There we go.
[24:15.19]Okay.
[24:17.46]I wish I could get a slide here, but it's not gonna really work.
[24:21.04]Get back in there.
[24:26.30]Yes!
[24:30.68]It's not gonna work, but I can at least try.
[24:39.16]Come on!
[24:42.29]Nice!
[24:43.11]There's my 50,000 attack bonus.
[24:47.55]Let's see what we can do.
[24:49.57]Oh, whatever.
[24:54.13]I was really hoping it was going to bounce the other way.
[24:59.84]Let's go!
[25:00.70]Let's go!
[25:01.42]I love how enthusiastic you guys are about this game.
[25:09.69]Now we have a chance to do something like crazy, right?
[25:12.55]Let's try to bounce it into the bucket.
[25:16.31]Well, let's just keep going.
[25:18.95]Do I dare?
[25:20.39]Do I dare?
[25:22.57]I don't dare, do I?
[25:24.75]I dare.
[25:25.59]I'm sorry.
[25:26.13]It was pretty much guaranteed.
[25:30.79]Every time I say it's not going to work, it goes flawlessly.
[25:35.95]Let's pebble for it.
[25:38.06]Hey, Walmart customer service.
[25:39.46]Thank you for three months.
[25:42.26]And, uh, dead?
[25:43.96]Dread Roberts for two months.
[25:47.36]And thank you, tenant, for your coffee question.
[25:48.90]But no, I don't think my pee smells weird after drinking coffee.
[25:56.45]10k.
[25:59.85]Get one orange attack style shot.
[26:01.75]Okay, this is weird.
[26:02.43]It sounds like a conveyor belt.
[26:05.01]Well, let's get it right in the butt cheeks.
[26:06.13]No.
[26:08.56]Didn't get it right in the butt crack.
[26:09.64]It's alright though.
[26:10.86]Should get in the bucket.
[26:12.00]Nope.
[26:13.91]This is going to be awesome because this super power is going to... I don't think it really matters.
[26:19.21]I have to wait until... Until there's a lot of space.
[26:22.43]I want to get the power shot here.
[26:24.95]Hurry up.
[26:25.71]Right there.
[26:30.98]Ah!
[26:31.46]Let's get the free ball.
[26:41.92]Ah, off the bucket edge again.
[26:43.91]How does my pee taste after drinking coffee?
[26:48.41]What?
[26:48.53]There we go, that's what I was looking for.
[26:55.41]Every time I get screwed over though.
[26:57.90]Every time.
[27:04.59]Hit the bonus one, dude.
[27:05.61]Come on.
[27:06.69]Screwing me over here.
[27:11.05]Come on!
[27:11.73]That's like the third or fourth time in a row where I've gotten destroyed by the bounce.
[27:24.35]There we go.
[27:25.05]There's actually a lot more to get here.
[27:30.14]I need a couple of bucket shots, otherwise I'm going to have to retry.
[27:33.83]That's not a bucket shot.
[27:34.79]Let's wait for this.
[27:35.33]Ah!
[27:35.45]Well, it looks like we're going to have to retry.
[27:54.64]I've got to get really lucky here or I'm going to have to retry.
[28:04.06]Come on, give me some lucky shit here.
[28:06.72]Give me some lucky dog shit!
[28:08.82]Come on!
[28:09.74]Yes!
[28:10.58]Alright, there's only two left.
[28:15.90]Alright, okay.
[28:17.00]Gotta be easy.
[28:17.86]Easy.
[28:18.96]Easy.
[28:19.50]Don't rush it.
[28:21.69]Hold on.
[28:24.61]This actually is gonna be hard, because it's right in the way.
[28:31.51]Oh!
[28:32.93]Free, free, free!
[28:35.07]Oh!
[28:35.61]Okay, do it again.
[28:53.00]Oh!
[28:53.14]Okay, hold on.
[28:54.36]I gotta stop this shit and get it.
[28:56.02]Just do it, it's not hard.
[28:57.00]It's right here.
[29:00.84]Okay!
[29:04.36]Jesus Christ!
[29:10.38]Ow!
[29:11.53]We got it, it's okay.
[29:12.55]We got it.
[29:16.15]My butt was never this tight before, God.
[29:19.41]Thank you, Tsunami, for your seven months.
[29:22.43]And puking victory for your 100 bits.
[29:25.29]How dare... Did you hear that, like, puke?
[29:28.07]I hope the music just, like, covered that up, because I just puked.
[29:32.03]I legit just, like... Thank you, Puking Face, for being a puke.
[29:41.10]You have a perfect name.
[29:42.36]How dare you underestimate the competitive capability of the Peggle 2?
[29:46.56]I've been playing Peggle for years, and this is a disgrace to the Peggle community.
[29:50.06]How dare you?
[29:54.68]I hope the music covered that up.
[29:56.38]Because that was disgusting.
[29:58.51]I'm sick.
[29:59.05]I'm sorry.
[29:59.67]I don't feel well.
[30:01.31]I'm sorry, guys.
[30:06.21]I can't help it.
[30:09.81]Shoot at the bucket and get infinite 5,000?
[30:11.12]I guess you could.
[30:16.06]I really, really, really need to...
[30:19.71]Just get one of these.
[30:20.73]And then just come on.
[30:24.29]Go right down the middle.
[30:25.91]Now that's a- Ah!
[30:27.51]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[30:29.03]Perfect.
[30:30.45]Now check this out.
[30:31.47]This is gonna be nuts.
[30:33.85]You guys ready for the pla- Hey, you got- Are you guys ready for the planters?
[30:36.99]Going nuts!
[30:37.71]Shot of the day!
[30:43.33]Fuck.
[30:46.34]I wanna restart right now so bad.
[30:54.82]I really want to restart right now.
[30:59.03]Can't shoot up there?
[30:59.95]Come on.
[31:07.69]Okay, if I didn't get that, I would have restarted.
[31:13.55]Although those up there are going to be extremely difficult to get.
[31:16.59]I think I should restart.
[31:19.71]I'm going to bounce it off this thing.
[31:25.12]Good bounce.
[31:26.78]In the bucket.
[31:27.24]Yeah.
[31:28.88]I'm a lawyer for planters nuts.
[31:31.82]Well, have a field day with this one.
[31:35.30]Planters sucks.
[31:38.22]Planters sucks.
[31:38.78]They're like tiny little razor blades.
[31:40.55]They cut up your mouth.
[31:42.95]What are you gonna do?
[31:45.37]You gonna sue me?
[31:46.29]Come on.
[31:46.99]Come get it.
[31:50.63]One time I ate planters, and I shit blood for a month.
[31:55.37]Are you going to sue me for defamation?
[31:56.85]Come on!
[32:01.88]That was uncalled for.
[32:03.14]I actually don't mind eating nuts.
[32:05.36]From Planters, the peanut version.
[32:12.18]Thank you, Apollo.
[32:12.98]Apollo 900 for the 10 bucks.
[32:14.74]Hey, Jerma, first time donating.
[32:17.04]Have you seen the Glue Man vs. Pizza Man official fan trailer?
[32:20.11]You're my favorite wheelbarrow streamer.
[32:23.51]Uh, I actually have- I've seen that, it's on the Jerma Reddit.
[32:25.91]I fucked that up, but it's fine, here we go.
[32:29.44]Uh, I saw that.
[32:32.14]I do- like I said before, I do browse the Jerma Reddit sometimes just to see... ...what, you know, people are talking about, what people are making fun of me and all, and... ...how ugly I am.
[32:42.06]Get in that bucket and just... Gah!
[32:45.24]Uh, what a troll.
[32:47.64]It trolled me.
[32:50.37]C-seriously, what the fuck?
[32:53.95]How... but how... I'm doing this so wrong.
[32:56.70]I gotta... further over like this.
[33:03.64]Right?
[33:05.72]Yeah.
[33:07.94]Not quite.
[33:08.36]There we go.
[33:11.77]Give me something here.
[33:13.93]Fuck.
[33:14.41]Last ball, I got two more.
[33:15.93]Time to do the prayer.
[33:18.47]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time... for the planters!
[33:26.26]Cashew extravaganza I Wanted to remember when I said I wanted to restart at the very beginning I should have Nice

[34:24.85]Let's go now.
[34:25.83]Got it.
[34:28.46]Wasn't worth it, but it's okay, because we're gonna go right down the middle like this.
[34:34.64]Yes!
[34:39.64]Excellent.
[34:42.94]Excellent!
[34:49.09]Excellent!
[34:53.85]Excellent!
[34:54.95]This one's actually pretty hard.
[35:01.96]They don't give you very many balls to work with here.
[35:15.67]Shit!
[35:26.10]Excellent!
[35:29.55]What the fuck am I doing?
[35:32.65]I don't want to hit the top here.
[35:34.01]Right, right, right, right, there.
[35:35.90]Uh-oh, how am I gonna get that one?
[35:40.10]Oh, shoot.
[35:42.27]Ooh, come on.
[35:43.83]Whoa, excellent.
[35:44.97]No, no, excellent.
[35:46.79]I got three tries to hit this ball.
[35:49.79]It has to be bounced off this.
[35:54.59]Oh, fuck me.
[35:55.47]This is not going to work.
[35:56.17]Uh-oh, what do I do here?
[35:59.27]Uh-oh.
[36:01.35]Uh-oh.
[36:01.93]Uh-oh.
[36:06.04]Uh-oh.
[36:09.94]Oh, fuck.
[36:13.67]I can't get this.
[36:22.55]Oh no.
[36:25.34]I don't think I can actually.
[36:26.48]I have to bounce it from across the whole map.
[36:28.52]Off this one.
[36:30.40]Here we go.
[36:34.02]Bounce it off the bucket.
[36:34.92]That's so risky.
[36:36.40]That's so risky.
[36:38.20]Hold on.
[36:38.58]I'll get it.
[36:40.12]Watch this.
[36:41.36]You guys ready for a fucking cashew streamer?
[36:44.28]No, that's not gonna work.
[36:48.81]Shit!
[36:53.97]This one's hard, man.
[37:04.41]I need to get it in there.
[37:05.85]Right inside of here.
[37:12.23]There we go.
[37:14.75]What a throw.
[37:16.21]How else was I supposed to get that one?
[37:17.47]These dumb little things are in the way.
[37:18.77]I got another shot, too.
[37:19.59]This is going to be good.
[37:24.59]Keep it in there.
[37:26.73]Right in the bucket.
[37:27.47]Yes.
[37:29.49]Good start.
[37:30.31]Good start.
[37:31.73]Very good start.
[37:33.49]Let's keep it up.
[37:34.83]That's not keeping it up.
[37:36.99]That's being terrible.
[37:38.09]Don't be terrible.
[37:39.43]What did I just tell you?
[37:42.90]Told you not to do shit like that and you did it again because you're just impatient.
[37:46.69]Look at how impatient I am.
[37:48.35]Stop just shooting the second it comes ready.
[37:50.77]Go now!
[37:52.55]You fucking dickhead.
[38:07.58]Getting these ones is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[38:11.06]Oh my god, I might have to restart here.
[38:26.04]How am I going to get these ones again?
[38:27.38]Again, the same problem like last time.
[38:33.26]That same stupid fucking orange ball from last time.
[38:35.60]I'm not going to be able to get it.
[38:36.60]This is such a crock of shit.
[38:40.31]Give me a free ball here.
[38:46.93]Two free balls.
[38:47.59]Okay.
[38:48.83]I have to... God damn it.
[39:02.98]Get the fuck over there, please.
[39:16.67]Oh, you shit.
[39:18.05]You stupid shithead.
[39:20.07]No.
[39:25.53]Get the fuck out of the way.
[39:27.05]Get out of the way.
[39:30.29]What?
[39:31.28]What?
[39:32.80]What?
[39:33.12]Why did it not hit it that time?
[39:36.42]Why?
[39:36.98]Okay.
[39:37.24]Excuse me.
[39:38.29]Excuse me.
[39:39.71]Why is it not hitting it now?
[39:42.85]What?
[39:45.43]It hit it.
[39:46.04]It's not hitting it anymore.
[39:58.63]That's not what I wanted to do.
[40:00.89]I can't believe it's the same one again.
[40:03.01]It's the fucking same one again I have to go off the I'm gonna have to go off the hoop Did it
[40:31.83]I did it.
[40:32.65]Yeah.
[40:34.65]That one was hard, man.
[40:41.79]That was a hard level.
[40:42.63]That was a hard game.
[40:47.21]Let's go, baby.
[40:48.08]Let's do it.
[40:52.06]I got some bits here.
[40:53.55]Thank you, MostlyToastedToast.
[40:57.81]Are you jealous of my one trillion cookies on Cookie Clicker?
[41:02.33]I loved Cookie Clicker.
[41:04.37]That game was so much fun.
[41:06.53]And then they made a hundred clones of it.
[41:09.79]And they still do.
[41:11.15]If you go to the App Store, there's always an idling Clicker game that's on the front page.
[41:17.57]They come out every week.
[41:18.55]A thousand of them.
[41:22.93]It's actually kind of insane.
[41:24.53]And that was also kind of insane too.
[41:26.86]Bounce up there.
[41:31.70]I'm going for some maniac shit here.
[41:37.52]Come on, give me some free balls.
[41:41.35]Of course, you're a clicker.
[41:44.03]Well, I didn't like it.
[41:44.71]It was a fun game.
[41:47.21]It was like unheard of at the time.
[41:54.41]I love this chain lining.
[41:56.32]Nice.
[41:56.56]Alright.
[41:56.90]I got plenty of balls to work with.
[41:57.84]I shouldn't get this much issue.
[41:59.70]Although I say that now.
[42:02.08]And I just fucked it up again, Jeremy.
[42:05.99]You fucked it up again, Jeremy.
[42:12.65]You fucked it up again, Jeremy.
[42:19.05]Come on into the bucket!
[42:22.52]Into the bucket too!
[42:24.18]It's alright, I get a free ball.
[42:28.94]And there we are.
[42:30.04]That was a little yonky yoink.
[42:31.10]I got some time to fuck around here.
[42:37.82]I'll just get this one.
[42:41.08]Well, that's unfortunate.
[42:44.61]I got three shots.
[42:45.75]Let's try to make something happen here.
[42:48.37]Yeah.
[42:49.03]Point boost.
[42:52.80]I can get even more free balls.
[42:53.90]Let's try to make this really work then.
[42:57.06]Let's really work for it.
[42:58.02]What do you say?
[42:58.46]I don't know.
[43:07.42]Nice to deal with Peggle.
[43:09.43]I'm just too... I'm too sick to... Apparently, my computer sucks, too, so I can't, like, do anything else right now to, like, figure out why that's happening to Hitman.
[43:21.38]Look at that.
[43:21.74]I meant for that to happen, too.
[43:23.28]And what'd you guys do?
[43:23.86]Go, like... Whoa!
[43:29.74]Ugh.
[43:31.67]Also, thank you to Verilic for the bits.
[43:33.81]Just wanted to let you know that if Resident Evil 7 is your first VR experience, you better be on cam while streaming it.
[43:39.52]Oh, it's gonna be a full-body camera.
[43:40.94]Are you serious?
[43:43.72]I'm doing a full-body standing-up camera for Resident Evil 7.
[43:47.76]First VR.
[43:48.46]First time with VR.
[43:52.79]Absolute thanks, Verilic, for the bits.
[43:55.19]Thank you, Pajagallo, for the bits as well.
[43:57.35]Mr. Hybee...
[43:59.79]Thank you for the $5, dude.
[44:02.51]We cashew now.
[44:04.58]Yeah, this is a sponsored cashew stream.
[44:08.58]Full body nude camera.
[44:14.02]Win without the gnome power?
[44:15.37]How is that even possible?
[44:17.87]Don't you have to hit them?
[44:25.31]That would have been cool if I got it in the box, but... You know... You know, sometimes it just doesn't work.
[44:33.01]Really great thing about having a... No, I can't even do it.
[44:35.75]I'm too sick to be able to do that.
[44:38.63]I honestly didn't even know I had that power.
[44:40.37]I was too busy pretending to make jokes.
[44:46.19]I might just restart this.
[44:47.35]Yeah, fuck this.
[44:48.31]We're doing this again.
[44:51.35]Can I have a diaper on too?
[44:53.39]Yeah!
[44:59.08]Who doesn't play Resident Evil in a fucking diaper?
[45:00.84]What are you talking about?
[45:05.22]Oh my god, that was so delicious.
[45:07.62]I loved it.
[45:12.03]Let's shoot this over here and get these out of the way.
[45:21.89]Come on.
[45:22.75]Look at that.
[45:24.47]It made a Windows beep sound because I did so good.
[45:27.86]I have 11 balls.
[45:29.14]Let's try to... I'm gonna sneeze and I can't mute it.
[45:32.42]I'm gonna sneeze.
[45:34.34]Well, I think I can do... Hold on.
[45:38.12]No.
[45:41.04]Come on.
[45:44.08]It's like trying... Trying to do it.
[45:49.66]Come on.
[45:52.48]It won't do it.
[45:53.14]It won't.
[45:55.23]Seriously, just won't fucking do it.
[45:58.43]And it hurts.
[46:03.36]My eyes are watering and it won't do it.

[50:13.55]Let's see.
[50:14.70]Let me tell you something.
[50:17.08]I was sick this afternoon.
[50:18.36]I was a little sick.
[50:19.52]Not a big deal.
[50:22.40]I took a little bit of NyQuil.
[50:24.59]Beautiful, unbelievable NyQuil.
[50:26.91]Best medicine, believe me.
[50:28.65]Eh, I guess it's not that bad.
[50:39.69]The latest and greatest form of political humor.
[50:45.27]Well, let me tell you something.
[50:49.60]We're all about political humor here, okay?
[50:53.76]Listen, listen to me.
[50:55.80]I am out.
[50:56.74]I'm going to sneeze again.
[50:57.78]I wish I just sneezed as Trump.
[50:59.12]That would have been fucking funny.
[51:01.19]Oh, look, the moon.
[51:03.27]There's the moon.
[51:04.99]What does her power do?
[51:07.29]Trump Moon.
[51:08.41]Trump Moon.
[51:13.42]Seriously.
[51:14.70]Seriously, Donald Trump is the moon.
[51:17.42]That is honest to God.
[51:20.14]He's the fucking moon.
[51:23.88]I need to clear these just so you can see.
[51:29.91]What?
[51:30.71]Why?
[51:32.17]Why?
[51:50.64]Seriously, this is the Donald Trump mood.
[51:52.20]He's gone!
[51:52.66]Where'd he go?
[51:53.32]What the fuck does this do?
[51:55.58]What?
[51:57.62]What is going on?
[51:59.34]Wow, that's an awesome power.
[52:01.84]It makes you...
[52:06.70]Oh, the moon, let me tell you.
[52:08.41]The moon is huge.
[52:10.09]The moon is absolutely huge.
[52:13.09]This power is pretty cool.
[52:15.97]Although I just... I'm too busy being a fuckface.
[52:22.15]There it is.
[52:22.71]There's the Donald Moon.
[52:23.57]I'm so fucking happy that that is Donald Trump.
[52:35.21]I think I'll still get it even though I've been doing nothing this whole run.
[52:43.11]Alright, what's this one?
[52:46.15]Yep.
[52:47.75]No!
[52:51.13]Oh, shit.

[52:55.21]Verilic with the 5,000.
[52:56.19]That's 50 bucks.
[52:57.17]$50 to President-elect Donald Moon.
[53:06.11]Thanks a lot, dude.
[53:08.21]Feralik says, you're a cool dude and I hope you get to feeling better soon.
[53:12.05]Mr. Trump, good luck as president.
[53:17.09]I can't fucking believe that.
[53:18.07]We start talking about Donald Trump and all of a sudden he's the fucking moon.
[53:22.39]That's unbelievable.
[53:24.87]But thanks a lot, Feralik.
[53:25.69]That's very generous of you.
[53:27.63]50 bucks, dude.
[53:28.87]50 bucks, dude.
[53:31.11]Appreciate that.
[53:32.47]Y'all appreciate that a lot, man.

[53:37.31]Donald Moon for president.
[53:38.59]Jesus.
[53:41.13]Chewy Rock, thanks for the seven bucks, 700 bits.
[53:43.10]Hey, Jeremy, everything of doing a movie night of your old vids with commentary like Star did.
[53:47.52]Um... I don't know, maybe.
[53:49.74]I mean, they did, like, an in-real-life thing now, didn't they?
[53:52.20]In Twitch.
[53:54.46]So, can't you... Can't you just, like... Can you watch just, like, YouTube videos on Twitch now?
[54:00.05]Is that allowed now?
[54:01.83]And, by the way, I think I made... No, no, no.
[54:04.55]I'll get it.
[54:06.31]I've got to be very, very precise with this.
[54:07.95]No, it's not going to work.
[54:11.79]Yes, it is!
[54:12.57]What am I talking about?
[54:13.57]Get in the 100k.
[54:18.83]Come on.
[54:24.59]I can't get over that shit.
[54:27.89]I can't fucking get over it.
[54:31.15]Why is that there in the corner?
[54:36.13]But thanks a lot, guys.
[54:37.85]Thank you to CJHockey77War2Studios.
[54:43.04]You have a long name, dude.
[54:44.46]But thanks a lot, Hockey, for the sub.
[54:48.74]And Hexbreed.
[54:49.85]Hexbread.
[54:50.41]I keep calling you Breed.
[54:51.15]I don't know why.
[54:51.65]Thanks for the four bucks, dude.
[54:54.55]Much appreciated.
[54:59.88]He's going to be there for the whole time we're here, isn't he?
[55:03.19]I will tell you, I'm the best and biggest.
[55:06.66]I will tell you, I'm the best and biggest moon you will ever see.
[55:10.52]I promise you.
[55:11.20]Believe me.
[55:11.98]Trust me on this.
[55:14.76]I'm the biggest moon there ever was and there ever will be.
[55:17.80]Okay?
[55:18.32]Listen.
[55:20.31]Hillary.
[55:21.33]Hillary is Pluto to me.
[55:23.61]Okay?
[55:24.61]Pluto.
[55:25.07]How big the moon is compared to Pluto?
[55:30.43]Pluto.
[55:33.10]Very big.
[55:34.35]Unbelievably big.
[55:37.71]Except the moon is probably like 30 times smaller than Pluto.
[55:44.37]I don't want to get too political here, because it's a very touchy subject.
[55:58.24]Why is Trump the godfather?
[56:02.56]Ooh, that's a little bit of... That was a three-piece.
[56:15.53]Give me the four-piece.
[56:16.69]And get in there.
[56:18.87]Give me at least five here.
[56:20.19]Ooh, and you get six.
[56:22.31]If you ask for five, you get six, and you're gonna get seven.
[56:25.20]You're gonna get that seven.
[56:28.31]Feels great.
[56:30.48]To be fair, these aren't politics.
[56:31.80]No, I know, but you know... The 2016 election is like... The most insane thing to talk about now.
[56:41.64]Just because it's... On either side, people get very, very, very, very, very heated.
[56:46.24]So, I'd like to stay clear of that if I could.
[56:57.81]Cheesy cheeseburger.
[56:58.65]Thanks for the two months.
[57:02.47]And... Kira Kane.
[57:05.42]Kyra Kane.
[57:05.94]I hope I'm saying that right.
[57:06.72]Thanks a lot.
[57:07.40]Welcome.
[57:10.58]Welcome... to the Dude Club.
[57:14.58]No, that's not the Dude Club.
[57:16.66]It's the... Um... The...
[57:28.96]I have no fucking idea.
[57:38.67]I'm sick.
[57:39.17]I can't come up with things anymore.
[57:40.71]Solid.
[57:43.17]Solid.
[57:50.96]Hey, Bosco.
[57:51.72]Thanks for the nine months.
[57:52.52]Hey, Jerma.
[57:52.86]Hope you start feeling better.
[57:53.84]Thanks, dude.
[57:55.98]Douche Nugget.
[57:57.80]Thank you.
[57:58.24]I'm gonna call you D-Nugget.
[58:01.86]Thanks, D-Nugget.
[58:05.12]Give me another 100%.
[58:06.30]So I look like a good boy.
[58:09.14]Another 100%.
[58:12.65]It's... It's possible, but it's not plausible.
[58:18.53]Just got a little bit more probable now.
[58:22.67]no it didn't unless I get that back okay it's still possible not probable not probable it's still possible it's still it's definitely a pop probability it's definitely a proper probability no it's still the thing we got with its potential
[58:44.61]Now there's a lot of potential here.
[58:47.11]There's perfect potential.
[58:48.43]There's a 100% profitability that I'll get.
[58:52.49]Check this out.
[58:53.95]Just gonna fuck this up.
[58:58.46]Almost fucked it up.
[59:07.45]probability.
[59:09.31]Power to the players, thanks for the bits.
[59:12.11]He wouldn't get sick of your style.
[59:14.47]Well, I haven't seen Star in a while.
[59:18.33]Me and Star are on... No, actually, what am I talking about?
[59:22.77]We played like EDF like a week ago.
[59:25.45]He's in like Las Vegas right now.
[59:27.39]I told him, I said, when he's in Vegas, because I'm a gambling man.
[59:32.34]I know the games and I understand how they're played.
[59:35.61]If you want to call me out on that, back a rat.
[59:37.13]Player hand, banker hand.
[59:38.83]Player hand doesn't have... The banker hand is a little bit of an edge in the casino because they've got to take a commission because it's pretty much a 50-50 game.
[59:44.86]So what your strategy is, you want to make sure that you... You want to put, like, the martingale strategies.
[59:50.56]You put $5 down.
[59:52.42]If you lose, you do $10.
[59:54.37]If you lose again, you do $20.
[59:55.69]And if you win, you go back to your original $5 bet.
[59:57.77]Call me out on that.
[59:58.35]I don't know what these things are.
[60:00.37]So... I told him...
[60:03.27]I told him, put a thousand dollars on the banker hand and back a rat.
[60:07.45]And then fucking get the fuck out of there.
[60:10.40]A thousand bucks, one.
[60:18.60]Tomorrow's my birthday.
[60:19.32]It feels like I've been six years old forever.
[60:25.51]That strat works a hundred percent.
[60:26.83]It's a martingale.
[60:28.31]Martingale strategy, whatever it's called.
[60:29.79]It's called one of those things.
[60:30.55]Extreme sliding coming, by the way.
[60:34.65]Did I say one?
[60:35.27]I meant to say two extreme slides.
[60:36.79]Did I say three?
[60:40.29]I meant to say two.
[60:40.93]I meant one.
[60:41.51]I meant two.
[60:50.08]Baccarat.
[60:51.04]You gotta play Baccarat.
[60:54.64]Baccarat has like the lowest house edge in the whole casino, unless you're gonna play Poker or Blackjack.
[61:05.29]Why did that move around so weirdly?
[61:09.09]Scary game, though.
[61:10.83]I'm gonna puke again.
[61:12.49]You're about to hear that puke sound again.
[61:17.90]No, maybe not.
[61:20.82]Well, I know what I gotta do here.
[61:22.00]Straight down.
[61:22.72]Try to get it stuck in here.
[61:28.13]Ah, it was worth a shot.
[61:29.21]It would've worked.
[61:30.85]I gotta do that again, though.
[61:34.18]Why is it doing that?
[61:35.08]I thought it was supposed to go through these dumb things.
[61:37.80]Whatever.
[61:41.68]I need some free balls here or we're going for a restart.
[61:47.50]Come on.
[61:48.35]Bounce over and get in there.
[61:49.61]Come on!
[61:50.95]That's not a free ball.
[61:52.13]How is that not a free ball?
[61:53.01]That's ridiculous.
[61:54.91]Ridiculous.
[61:57.71]Ridiculous.
[62:00.67]If you back her out, it's a card game.
[62:03.02]Give me a combo here.
[62:08.12]Into the bucket.
[62:11.28]Into the bucket!
[62:12.66]Into the bucket!
[62:14.36]Ugh, why?
[62:22.29]Well, here it comes.
[62:26.25]It's win or lose.
[62:30.04]What am I talking about?
[62:30.90]This is the best walnut inspired fucking sponsored stream we've ever been on.
[62:38.79]Blames he knows gambling but doesn't know Texas Hold'em.
[62:42.09]I know about the river card, come on.
[62:49.99]I know all about the river card.
[62:54.23]Ooh, scary.
[62:58.69]Sponsored, sponsored stream.
[63:02.49]No.
[63:05.08]Let's be real.
[63:06.66]What kind of fucking idiot would sponsor a Peggle 2 stream right now?
[63:11.60]Hey, you know that game that came out like fucking two years ago?
[63:17.40]Yeah, we want to like pay you to play it.
[63:21.48]It is fun though.
[63:25.42]I will say it is fun.
[63:28.07]Can we get a slide here?
[63:34.67]Nope.
[63:35.19]I feel like I can get a slide over there, I think.
[63:38.04]No, that's not smart.
[63:39.12]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[63:45.66]I completely blew that.
[63:47.90]It doesn't even matter.
[63:48.54]I think I can still win it.
[64:02.11]I just got way too impatient for some reason.
[64:03.91]Don't ask me why.
[64:04.51]Yeah, I'm restarting.
[64:09.81]I was shooting for no reason.
[64:15.59]Get down there and slide.
[64:16.77]Into the bucket.
[64:18.57]Look at that.
[64:18.91]Better start.
[64:21.49]This is only two years old, isn't it?
[64:22.95]2014 or something?
[64:23.93]2013?
[64:23.95]Something like that.
[64:31.31]Why?
[64:31.65]Because I didn't like that run.
[64:34.42]It wasn't a good run for me.
[64:39.00]Too bad.
[64:42.00]I actually would rather for this level for these to be here.
[64:45.03]Bounce up more things.
[64:50.29]The girl's face is scary.
[64:53.43]She is supposed to be like a ghoul.
[64:59.94]hmm what's gonna be the hardest one to get those ones down there no not really maybe this one oh oh too bad that was beautiful oh that would have been fantastic oh well
[65:27.97]She's doing the Pee Wee Herman thing.
[65:29.55]Apparently I'm going to blow this somehow.
[65:34.50]I don't know how the fuck I'm doing that.
[65:35.88]Somehow I'm going to end up blowing this.
[65:40.16]You know I will.
[65:42.84]Stop doing that.
[65:43.70]That is fucking weird.
[65:46.32]Oh my god.
[65:47.10]Eat my asshole.
[65:48.68]That was very inappropriate.
[65:49.76]I'm sorry.
[65:52.18]Had to be simple.
[66:00.71]This one is actually going to be hard to get.
[66:05.93]Woo, snuck it in there!
[66:07.77]Snuck it in there under the rug.
[66:09.89]Underneath the rug, we're good.
[66:20.66]Literally the worst.
[66:24.34]That wasn't that bad.
[66:30.47]Let's take a look here.
[66:33.63]Uh, the dude, 97,000 for four months.
[66:34.65]Thanks a lot, dude, says.
[66:36.23]Dude, Jerma, last month I mentioned that I nearly died in my sleep because I started laughing so hard I was coughing during your Archmage beckon stream.
[66:43.92]But I forgot to actually mention why.
[66:45.34]It was your clippet joke.
[66:47.48]Thanks for nearly killing me.
[66:49.92]Well, if it makes you feel any better, uh, dude.
[66:53.34]I almost died too.
[66:56.20]I was like drinking shit when that happened.
[67:00.79]That was fucking crazy.
[67:03.43]But I'm glad you're still with us.
[67:06.53]But thanks for the four months.
[67:08.79]Orthocone, $5, 500 bits.
[67:11.23]Here's that sponsor money I owe you.
[67:14.39]Who gave the 300?
[67:14.83]How come it doesn't say their name?
[67:17.97]Who gave the 300 bits?
[67:18.77]Just out of curiosity, when's the next Let It Die stream?
[67:20.81]Why is Twitch Alerts not showing that to me?
[67:24.83]Thank you for your $3, dude, whoever you are.
[67:28.16]And Sam, thanks for the bits.
[67:29.68]Power to the players of the bits.
[67:30.68]I think I got you all ready.
[67:32.46]And Sonicite.
[67:33.11]This is the best walnut stream I've ever watched.
[67:35.99]Thanks, man.
[67:41.11]Get two long shots.
[67:42.49]Okay.
[67:45.57]Oh, speaking of walnuts, we got like annoying walnuts now.
[67:50.34]You gotta take off their shell before you enjoy the creamy center.
[67:55.70]I don't like this level.
[67:56.42]I hate levels that have these... Brownie face.
[68:00.46]You know what I'm talking about when I say that.
[68:05.36]I hate these levels.
[68:06.18]I don't like them.
[68:07.66]Give me everything on the top row.
[68:10.60]Come on.
[68:11.24]Everything on the top row.
[68:13.91]And in the bucket.
[68:15.99]No, you're killing me.
[68:17.27]You're killing me.
[68:17.91]You are actually killing me.
[68:24.16]Oh, you're killing me!
[68:28.18]Six more shots is... Into the bucket!
[68:33.75]Yes!
[68:34.67]You're no longer killing me.
[68:36.49]Thank you.
[68:37.69]Thank you, game.
[68:39.53]Thank you, video game.
[68:40.95]Although, this is not good.
[68:42.54]It's not great.
[68:45.20]It isn't great.
[68:59.97]I'm sorry.
[69:03.67]I'm sorry.
[69:05.25]Oh, don't throw.
[69:06.07]No, now's not the time to throw.
[69:07.73]Now's not the time to throw the game.
[69:09.33]Stop throwing the game.
[69:10.31]No, I'm fine.
[69:11.71]I got four.
[69:12.09]I had to do that.
[69:18.12]Come on, get one of those.
[69:23.56]Ah.
[69:27.36]Shit.
[69:28.26]This is not good.
[69:31.26]This is very, very not good.
[69:39.35]Get both of them!
[69:40.29]Yes!
[69:41.53]Oh, still gonna lose?
[69:49.47]Am I still gonna lose?
[69:53.01]I don't think so.
[70:02.04]How is that not a long shot?
[70:08.61]Thanks, Mr. Kool-Aid, for the 500 bits, the five bucks.
[70:11.33]Here's bits to all the people we lost during the clip-it stream.
[70:17.39]Let's try something thrilling.
[70:18.29]Get fever and 750,000 points.
[70:19.29]Yeah.
[70:19.39]Score of 750,000 points.
[70:29.40]Are you shitting me?
[70:30.12]That seems a little hard.
[70:31.16]I'm gonna get like a million points.
[70:34.54]How many was that?
[70:43.60]That's like 40,000 points.
[70:48.11]Oh my god, I'm not 70.
[70:54.75]Actually, that's not gonna be too horrible.
[70:58.69]What?! !
[71:00.84]You're killing me!
[71:01.42]Game, you're killing me!
[71:03.44]I'm actually not even close.
[71:11.95]But, you know.
[71:14.21]Where's the point ball?
[71:17.92]Am I gonna have to restart this if I don't get something?
[71:25.08]Or is that just, hey, try to get that.
[71:31.68]Well, that was a shitload.
[71:33.70]How much was that?
[71:37.93]200.
[71:37.95]Oh, I'm not even fucking close.
[71:44.96]Did I get it?
[71:57.17]I got it, right?
[71:57.79]Yeah.
[72:00.33]I got it.
[72:00.91]Easy.
[72:01.13]I'm sorry you're hearing these fucking noises.
[72:05.42]I can't help it.
[72:09.20]Try Nightshade later on when your multiplier is higher.
[72:13.02]Okay.
[72:16.65]Okay.
[72:25.70]I wish that got all of them, because I would like to... Get the fuck out of there.
[72:29.34]I thought this was a make-up stream.
[72:36.05]No, this is just a regular stream.
[72:38.59]Make-up streams not until this weekend.
[72:40.69]Probably Sunday.
[72:42.55]Hopefully I can figure out what the hell was wrong with Hitman.
[72:46.57]Well, this is a pretty good alternative.
[72:48.79]I'm fine with this.
[72:52.43]Let's go right... Come on, right there.
[72:56.44]Give me a super slide.
[72:58.48]Slide here!
[73:00.74]Get the orange one.
[73:01.42]At least get the orange one.
[73:02.74]No, you're gonna do this to me again.
[73:06.23]Makeup tutorial.
[73:07.35]Yeah, I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial.
[73:09.99]That was good.
[73:18.29]What happened to Hitman?
[73:19.35]Uh... I opened it and my CPU went to 100% in the new mission.
[73:24.37]So... Something to do with how that new mission is rendered?
[73:28.33]My CPU can't do it.
[73:29.85]For some reason.
[73:31.41]Though, unfortunately, we couldn't play it.
[73:34.37]Couldn't play it.
[73:35.11]Oh well.
[73:38.51]Got a big basket, too.
[73:39.69]Nice.
[73:43.20]Ah!
[73:44.96]God damn it.
[73:45.58]That would've been great if it went in the bucket.
[73:48.59]Okay.
[73:51.95]I need to get two.
[73:57.91]That works.
[74:08.22]That works.
[74:09.46]That doesn't work for me.
[74:11.70]I really need to get this one over here.
[74:21.21]Come on.
[74:23.41]Well, let's just do this one.
[74:24.61]It's right here.
[74:26.75]Into the bucket.
[74:27.91]You have to seriously do that to me.
[74:29.17]Nice.
[74:34.05]Alright.
[74:34.71]This one ain't going to be easy.
[74:38.04]It's not going to be easy, but it's okay.
[74:39.46]We're cheesy.
[74:44.42]Is this going to do it?
[74:45.32]If I just...
[74:51.94]Shit.
[74:54.20]Shit!
[75:00.10]Shit!
[75:03.44]Give me a fucking free ball!
[75:06.32]Hey, I know which one I have to get first.
[75:14.04]This stupid fucking one over there.
[75:16.50]God.
[75:21.08]I can't even shoot the damn thing over there, either.
[75:23.15]This sucks.
[75:26.97]Ugh, you fucking bag of shit.
[75:36.07]No, I have to- that hound ha- I- If I don't get rid of that one, like- No, look!
[75:39.09]It's not over there anymore!
[75:40.30]Take it away!
[75:41.06]Take it away!
[75:41.48]It's not over there!
[75:43.44]The one impossible one to get, and we moved it this time.
[75:49.98]game of the year.
[75:51.66]Right?
[75:52.30]Was this even game of the year?
[75:53.68]I don't think so.
[76:03.36]I'm okay with that.
[76:11.25]No swearing.
[76:13.63]I didn't promise no swears this trade.
[76:20.05]Game of the month Keep bouncing and in the bucket skills Wait bounced off two things and in the bucket and let's do it again.
[76:40.61]Yeah, that wasn't very skillful It's okay
[76:53.29]That hurts my throat when I do that.
[76:59.40]I can't do that anymore.
[77:01.60]Only a couple more.
[77:14.77]What the hell was that?
[77:25.74]That would have been perfect.
[77:26.94]That would have actually been really perfect, considering I could have just won right now.
[77:31.17]Well, I have a guaranteed victory, so let's just try as many as we can.
[77:34.21]100%.
[77:39.19]I can do this.
[77:41.33]Good enough.
[77:42.99]Smart enough.
[77:45.27]Doggone it.
[77:47.89]People like me.
[77:50.52]Come on, Stuart.
[77:56.28]Now that was high quality.
[77:59.74]That was high quality.
[78:04.12]That was low quality.
[78:05.29]I just wanted to make sure you could tell the difference.
[78:11.25]High quality.
[78:17.61]This one's going to be a pain in the ass.
[78:23.62]Maybe bounce it off this one instead.
[78:34.69]Give me the ball back.
[78:40.81]That's fucking low quality.
[78:52.32]Yes!
[78:54.20]I just gotta do that again.
[78:55.66]I need one more ball!
[78:59.16]What, do I have an opportunity to shoot this straight through?
[79:01.11]I don't think I do.
[79:05.50]Keep giving me those back at rat 50-50s.
[79:07.50]Fuck.
[79:10.92]Get in here.
[79:11.90]Get in the extreme fever.
[79:13.84]In the extreme fever.
[79:14.80]Come on.
[79:16.36]Come on.
[79:16.78]Not right into the 10,000.
[79:17.62]I tried.
[79:31.05]Go for it.
[79:32.97]I would not have gotten it.
[79:38.84]Thanks a lot, Kyle.
[79:40.00]Thanks for eight months, Kyle.
[79:42.92]And Rudolfo.
[79:45.66]Play RimWorld?
[79:48.86]Uh, I don't think... RimWorld's not really my type of game.
[79:55.38]I'm not really into those types of games.
[79:59.27]What are these spider egg sacs?
[80:01.53]Okay, I wanted to shoot it to see if it did anything, but apparently not.
[80:05.58]We're gonna go ahead and restart, because I want to know if the egg sacs did anything, if like a spider came out, but no, they don't, so... No, fuck it.
[80:12.00]We can start over.
[80:18.74]Crunchy!
[80:22.04]That's gonna be the hardest ones.
[80:27.70]Let's try to get the tough ones first.
[80:30.18]Oh.
[80:30.78]Please.
[80:39.33]Oh, my God.
[80:42.43]Can't seem to catch a break with these things.
[80:47.32]That was awful.
[80:51.26]My nose is too stuffed up.
[80:52.52]I'm trying to do, like, an Irish thing.
[80:54.44]No, not gonna happen.
[80:55.74]If I had a clear nasal passage, I'd be able to do it.
[80:59.68]I'm not good with accents anyways.
[81:02.42]Why am I trying?
[81:05.36]Fucking loser.
[81:10.23]No, not the accent.
[81:11.69]Not the accents.
[81:16.15]Don't do the accents.
[81:17.13]Don't kill us.
[81:17.89]You're doing it too fast.
[81:29.25]It's because my nose hurts.
[81:31.13]I have to do it fast.
[81:31.97]Somebody just got a full Widowmaker.
[81:33.73]How the fuck did you do that?
[81:40.81]Come on, I kicked it off the chute.
[81:42.37]Get out of the way.
[81:46.12]Stupid egg sack.
[81:47.16]Fuck off.
[81:47.98]Got it.
[81:54.60]Three pegs to get.
[81:56.55]Four shots.
[81:58.01]I need to get two.
[81:58.77]Actually, these would be pretty easy to get.
[82:03.81]Just gotta line it up correctly.
[82:05.29]Hopefully that's in the right spot.
[82:08.85]It is.
[82:09.21]Free ball.
[82:11.48]Now let's not fuck this one up.
[82:13.36]Alright, well, I got two tries to do this.
[82:23.05]Give me the 100k.
[82:25.39]You can always tell it's a lady spider because of the body.
[82:31.63]Wait, what?
[82:36.43]The game's too loud?
[82:38.13]Should I turn the game down?
[82:40.57]It also might have something to do with the fact that I'm, like, lower than usual because... I'm stuffed up.
[82:45.75]That might be what it is, but if it's not, I mean, I can... I'll drop it a little bit more.
[82:51.11]We'll go down to, like... Here.
[82:58.65]It's fine.
[82:59.84]Volume's fine.
[83:00.60]No, no, no!
[83:01.70]Oh, shit!
[83:03.02]Turn it up!
[83:03.86]Oh, sorry.
[83:04.28]Sorry.
[83:07.35]Boost it.
[83:08.23]Boost it back.
[83:10.41]I can't... I'm having trouble hearing now, guys.
[83:12.13]Didn't I tell you that?
[83:16.17]My ears are clogged.
[83:16.99]My nose is clogged.
[83:18.25]I can't even tell if I'm screaming right now.
[83:19.71]Am I actually live?
[83:20.60]I don't even know.
[83:22.66]This is...
[83:34.71]Nice.
[83:35.69]Nice.
[83:36.26]Very nice.
[83:36.96]Very nice.
[83:37.28]Very nice.
[83:38.66]Let's take care of the ones back here because holy shit, I'm never going to get those.
[83:44.62]That's how you get it done.
[83:48.61]That's how you get it done.
[83:50.90]If anyone ever asks you in your life, look, Dave, how do I get it done?
[83:58.12]You watch that clip.
[83:59.87]You watch what just happened, and that's how you show them.
[84:01.89]That's how they know.
[84:03.45]You say, well, here's how you get it done.
[84:04.73]You show them the clip, and they go, fuck.
[84:07.15]That's true.
[84:07.95]That is how you get it done.
[84:10.52]I should probably do that.
[84:22.13]Which is the voices in your head.
[84:25.05]That would be fucking... That would be really weird.
[84:29.95]I'm just not even streaming at all.
[84:31.24]I'm just seeing text on my screen.
[84:37.38]Look, just in case somebody... You know, show that... You show that one, too.
[84:40.00]In case somebody wants to know how to get it done.
[84:43.40]I'm friends.
[84:44.87]Why don't you get a show on that one, too?
[84:50.70]You know, one of your friends, if they ever ask you how to get it out, show them that one.
[85:02.96]We can mess around a little here.
[85:03.94]I try to get 100%.
[85:04.65]Am I sick?
[85:06.83]Yes, I am.
[85:09.83]I am.
[85:10.81]Give me 100% here.
[85:11.57]It's been like five.
[85:13.75]Not going to happen, no.
[85:17.85]Any tips on how to make broccoli good?
[85:20.95]There's a lot of ways, man.
[85:24.53]Broccoli.
[85:25.85]Steamed broccoli with salt.
[85:27.17]A little bit of butter and some oil.
[85:31.14]That shit's... A little bit of cheese, maybe?
[85:33.18]Replace the butter and the... Well, you can keep butter in there, but... See, I'm... I'm, like, speaking and I'm just shooting balls into nowhere.
[85:41.52]But, okay.
[85:44.12]Yeah.
[85:44.34]A little bit of butter and salt.
[85:45.24]Pepper.
[85:46.02]Steam them.
[85:46.34]A little bit of oil.
[85:50.02]You know.
[85:50.94]It's not okay.
[85:51.88]It's not a big deal.
[85:53.80]Don't steam it?
[85:55.48]Why not?
[85:55.90]Put it in the Ster fry, too.
[85:58.10]Put it in the pan.
[85:58.74]You know what I'm saying?
[86:03.55]Take some broccoli and throw it in the pan.
[86:05.41]You're all set.
[86:15.77]I used to eat raw broccoli.
[86:16.67]Okay.
[86:18.06]Kind of disgusting, actually, now that I think about it.
[86:21.86]Just cold, raw, crunchy-ass broccoli.
[86:31.62]Excellent!
[86:35.82]Why is this the Fable soundtrack?
[86:39.62]Soundtracked?
[86:40.72]Soundtrack.
[86:41.18]Listen to this.
[86:41.80]This is Fable.
[86:45.33]Listen.
[86:49.46]Turn this shit off.
[86:50.44]I want to hear the actual song.
[86:54.44]Isn't that like Fable 1?
[87:05.22]It is.
[87:18.08]It is!
[87:21.73]Any time you want your friend to show you how to be a fucking hoe, get it done.
[87:30.20]I can do that fucking pretty fast.
[87:35.98]What do you guys think?
[87:40.81]Okay, let's go.
[87:45.27]Nah, it's too loud.
[87:48.47]One more.
[88:01.69]You're going crazy.
[88:05.91]I haven't been taking cold medicine.
[88:08.47]I think I am crazy.
[88:13.73]This one's not a good run here.
[88:17.69]Needs improvement.
[88:19.41]Zero out of ten.
[88:25.19]I wasn't looking for a letter score.
[88:30.97]With some lucky bucket drops, this actually is pretty doable.
[88:39.24]Yep.
[88:42.20]Uh-oh.
[88:44.08]Uh-oh.
[88:44.72]I need to get like one or two here.
[88:47.90]One or two.
[88:49.75]This is bad.
[88:52.15]I really need to get... No, this ain't gonna happen.
[88:57.85]Actually, no.
[88:58.29]Ah, I got a free ball.
[88:59.09]It's okay.
[89:02.24]I need to get these two.
[89:06.31]Alright, this just got potentially doable.
[89:09.13]Potentially.
[89:17.35]Come on.
[89:19.83]Shit.
[89:25.93]Ah!
[89:26.41]What?
[89:28.27]Shit!
[89:30.05]Alright, here we go.
[89:35.24]Come on, bounce it back.
[89:38.00]You fucking god damn it.
[89:42.53]I knew it wasn't gonna work.
[89:46.41]I'm gonna just start itching my head.
[89:48.71]God, I've got, like, I've got fucking fleas!
[89:50.71]Now it is turning into, like, a fever dream.
[89:59.30]I got bugs on me!
[90:14.55]Nah, this is, this is, I'm gonna do this shit again.
[90:17.80]This is bullshit.
[90:23.66]They're very spread out.
[90:25.80]I don't like how, I don't like how spread out they are in this one, you know?
[90:31.42]Getting so fucked.
[90:35.20]Can you stop fucking me here?
[90:39.35]I'd, like, appreciate a little bit of non... non-getting-screwed-over.
[90:44.18]It's not gonna happen.
[90:53.70]It's not gonna happen.
[90:54.56]Just... Okay.
[90:56.18]Fine.
[90:57.25]Can't even... Can't catch a break.
[90:58.53]Usually it's these ones that, like, a big, huge point score will happen now.
[91:02.87]Nope.
[91:04.47]Not gonna catch a break.
[91:05.45]Ever.
[91:05.63]Nope.
[91:08.72]Look at this.
[91:09.02]Look at this.
[91:10.64]This is nonsense.
[91:11.52]Nonsense.
[91:13.18]What is this RNG?
[91:14.60]What is this RNG bullshit, you know?
[91:17.79]Look at this.
[91:18.07]Look at that RNG.
[91:18.87]Are you serious?
[91:20.71]How is that even possible?
[91:22.03]Is that what people say?
[91:34.28]I'm getting so fucking screwed.
[91:41.49]How it feels to chew five gum.
[91:48.66]I almost just got screwed.
[91:52.06]I still don't think it was enough though.
[91:54.72]Gonna do some skimmage here.
[91:55.80]Okay, that's alright.
[92:02.60]Wacky shit has to happen for me to win here.
[92:04.64]Come on.
[92:06.58]Get over there quick!
[92:13.55]Come on, it was over there!
[92:14.85]Come on.
[92:19.44]Come on, this is supposed to be a cashew stream.
[92:22.48]I can't let the fucking cachettes down.
[92:31.73]I can't let them down!
[92:32.63]You guys think I'm gonna be able to let you guys down on a cashew fucking stream?
[92:39.27]No, I don't think so.
[92:51.70]The cashettes.
[92:52.46]You know that.
[92:53.24]C-H.
[92:53.74]How do you spell cash?
[92:55.70]C-A-S-H.
[92:58.04]E-W.
[93:00.30]C-A-S-H-E-W.
[93:03.42]E-T-T-E-S.
[93:06.13]The cashwettes.
[93:07.05]Yeah, you guys are the cashwettes.
[93:12.45]That's what I'm calling you guys from now on.
[93:14.41]What's your stream name?
[93:27.54]Ooh.
[93:31.46]Look at the smiley face.
[93:32.26]Is that a smiley face or is that a guy with buttons?
[93:34.06]Can't tell.
[93:36.30]Good joke.
[93:37.34]That's not a joke.
[93:37.98]That's just to give you the fucking cash sweats, man.
[93:44.29]The one problem with Peggle is sometimes you do get in a situation where you see where the two green blocks are.
[93:50.49]There was no way I could actually get those.
[93:52.39]So you end up just restarting instantly.
[93:56.30]But I didn't.
[93:57.20]It's okay.
[94:03.56]It got out.
[94:04.30]It actually escaped.
[94:06.28]That's not cool.
[94:08.75]Yeah.
[94:15.24]Is this my favorite game?
[94:16.26]No, it's just fun to chill and play and just talk to you guys.
[94:19.78]I mean, I am sick.
[94:20.86]It's a good just relaxing hangout game where nothing really matters.
[94:23.96]It's not a big deal.
[94:27.62]You can just hang out.
[94:28.35]Not get angry or anything.
[94:33.47]You can still get angry, but not necessarily that angry.
[94:40.55]You're playing Peggle.
[94:41.29]Are you eight?
[94:44.03]No, I mean, well, you missed the story while we're playing this game.
[94:52.00]That's not the story.
[94:55.10]That's the beginning of the story, I'm sick.
[94:57.26]We were going to play Hitman, the new holiday mission, but for some reason... It's like, it's bricking my computer.
[95:04.02]My CPU goes to 100% when I load the new mission.
[95:08.95]It's the only mission in the whole game that does that, I don't know why.
[95:12.13]But it does.
[95:21.68]Oh, shit.
[95:24.18]These two weren't in the way.
[95:25.34]Let's try this.
[95:27.37]Beautiful.
[95:30.03]Actually, not beautiful.
[95:35.79]That was beautiful.
[95:36.43]Uh-oh.
[95:41.36]Uh-oh.
[95:46.02]Can I get it over there?
[95:47.12]Can I skim it?
[95:50.94]Shit.
[96:03.56]What's the point of Peggle?
[96:04.78]Peggle, you have to clear all the orange blocks.
[96:09.26]If you do not clear all the orange blocks in the allotted balls that you have, you lose.
[96:17.25]The blue and purple pegs and green... Well, the green pegs give you power-ups.
[96:22.74]Depending on what hero or character is currently there.
[96:30.52]The purple power-ups are point multipliers.
[96:35.84]The blue are just there to kind of get in the way and they add points.
[96:42.08]Did I just beat the game?
[96:43.86]Congratulations, you beat the game.
[96:46.70]Oh, no, it's not over.
[96:49.80]Now you have to buy the DLC.
[96:51.76]What?
[97:00.95]Celestial Realm?
[97:02.25]No, we're not over.
[97:04.31]We're not over yet.
[97:05.57]We're not done yet.
[97:06.23]Well, let's see what it is.
[97:13.36]How the egg ended up there is a huge story.
[97:15.44]Let's see what it is.
[97:16.80]Select a master.
[97:18.24]Oh, this is where it gets interesting.
[97:19.44]You actually can pick what you want.
[97:20.44]I'm going to go with the boulder guy.
[97:24.36]I like the boulder guy because I like his music.
[97:32.91]Does it play his music?
[97:41.64]It does.
[97:41.92]Let's turn it up.
[97:43.58]This guy's got the best music.
[97:57.63]Best music and the best sounds.
[98:05.52]And the best goats.
[98:12.49]How can I get it to slide?
[98:15.33]Slide it!
[98:15.97]Slide it!
[98:16.83]Slide it!
[98:17.47]Shit.
[98:24.73]Alright, now we drop the boulder.
[98:30.21]It's going right up Main Street.
[98:37.11]Probably could've timed that better.
[98:38.07]Alright, we're doing it again over here.
[98:45.30]Come on, hurry up!
[98:50.92]Oh, thanks for the reminder.
[98:52.47]I... didn't read any subs for, like, the last, like, 20 minutes.
[98:56.33]Thank you, Kleiner Finn, for two months.
[99:00.97]It's the story!
[99:03.88]This isn't a story game.
[99:08.08]That would've been amazing.
[99:09.44]Still might be, still might be!
[99:10.70]No.
[99:13.29]Thanks a lot, Kleiner.
[99:14.37]Following Snail, thanks for the sub.
[99:16.71]Shock, thanks for the three months.
[99:21.52]LOL, no, I'm Dirty Dan.
[99:23.08]Thanks for the bits.
[99:24.40]Pinwheel64, thanks for the three bucks.
[99:26.04]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[99:26.72]Bloodborne would be a pretty chill stream.
[99:28.90]You can play Bloodborne now.
[99:29.98]Yeah, I could.
[99:32.84]I could just open Bloodborne right now and just attack things.
[99:37.35]Or I could do Let It Die.
[99:38.75]We'll see.
[99:40.94]Thank you, Croucher, for the bits.
[99:42.42]And Mr. Kool-Aid for the bits as well.
[99:44.80]And Mamba, thank you for the 130.
[99:50.16]Much love.
[99:50.60]Oh, that's what happens when I just don't pay attention.
[99:53.36]I can still do it.
[99:55.76]No, I can't.
[99:56.18]There's so many over there that I didn't get.
[99:58.21]I'm just screwed right now.
[99:59.37]I need to shoot the ball over there.
[100:00.63]No, I'm going to have to restart.
[100:09.77]Ah.
[100:11.07]Alright, what do you guys think?
[100:13.25]Here's what we'll do.
[100:15.11]I'll give you a poll.
[100:17.52]I beat everything in Pekka, like 100% of the game, so we're all set with it.
[100:22.26]Let's do a straw poll.
[100:26.82]The thing is about Bloodborne, I mean, I could just start a new game or something.
[100:31.02]We'll see.
[100:32.78]I'm not going to stream for too much longer because I do need to take medicine and go lie down again.
[100:36.70]I just wanted to make sure I did a stream.
[100:39.22]It was supposed to be Hitman, but, you know, I could tell that story again, but I'm not going to.
[100:44.43]Bloodborne.
[100:49.87]Let it die.
[100:50.59]Or what else is on PS4?
[100:53.83]What else can I just switch to?
[100:58.23]I'll just put, like, or more Peggle, I guess.
[101:02.06]Let's see what you guys have to say.
[101:03.34]Bloodborne, let it die, or... Peggle.
[101:08.42]Thanks for sticking around, though, guys.
[101:10.08]There was, um... Had to restart the stream once, and there was all the bullshit with technical problems.
[101:16.91]So I do appreciate people hanging out and powering through it.
[101:29.48]What about the channel update?
[101:31.51]Uh, did you refresh?
[101:33.43]Wait, what?
[101:35.57]The channel update?
[101:36.75]Oh, excuse me.
[101:37.62]Excuse me, you're talking about this beautiful video.
[102:01.12]And there we are.
[102:01.66]For those of you that didn't get to see that earlier.
[102:09.74]Bloodborne is currently winning.
[102:11.62]Another couple minutes.
[102:16.79]It's close between Bloodborne and Let It Die.
[102:21.29]Peggle was fun though.
[102:23.91]You know, Peggle can be my go-to just game if like shit plans just don't happen.
[102:28.22]I can just come and play this and just chill and talk to you guys.
[102:32.54]The sun is orbiting?
[102:33.86]That's what it's like in the solar system, dude.
[102:36.91]Everything orbits the moon.
[102:39.13]The moon is the center of the universe.
[102:41.25]It's five times bigger than Jupiter.
[102:45.75]Oh, this is close.
[102:46.45]I'm going to go with like ten more seconds.
[102:49.33]Between Let It Die and Bloodborne.
[102:56.94]This is a little too close to call at the moment.
[103:01.16]Peggle was hype.
[103:01.78]Well, I appreciate that, dude.
[103:04.32]Happy you enjoyed it.
[103:05.80]It's a fun game.
[103:11.10]39 to 36% for Bloodborne over Let It Die.
[103:14.42]Let's see the video again.
[103:15.24]You'll see it again, you know, Sunday when I stream again.
[103:31.95]Alright, 10 seconds.
[103:33.84]And then I just switch the blood.
[103:34.76]It's going to be easy to switch the Bloodborne.
[103:38.38]Pegalin midday streams in dice.
[103:39.54]Yeah, and the reason why I'm starting so early today is so I can just be in bed by like 8 or 9 rather than start at 7 o'clock and go till like midnight.
[103:51.21]Why is Skate 3 not in the poll?
[103:52.71]Because we don't talk about Skate 3.
[103:57.03]Alright, Bloodborne it is.
[103:58.63]Didn't win by very much, but Bloodborne it is.
[104:01.77]Thank you for voting.
[104:03.74]I'll just go, I don't know, maybe I'll just kill the first boss or something.
[104:07.74]And then call it.
[104:08.88]We'll see.
[104:09.56]See if I can get into it again.
[104:15.42]But I'll be live on Sunday to make up for not having a stream yesterday.
[104:24.71]Rigged?
[104:26.29]It's not rigged.
[104:30.54]Why am I always sick?
[104:32.28]I haven't been sick like this in a long time.
[104:35.02]Stuffy nose boy and shit.
[104:38.72]Do an AMA?
[104:40.92]No.
[104:42.48]You guys already know how I feel about everything.
[104:44.26]I pretty much do an AMA every stream.
[104:46.58]I just talk about shit.
[104:48.66]Have I played Bloodborne before?
[104:49.82]Bloodborne is one of my favorite games ever made.
[104:51.64]Yes, I played it a bunch of times.
[104:53.47]And no death run?
[104:56.74]Bloodborne again?
[104:57.70]I've never played Bloodborne on stream.
[104:59.76]It's the first time I've ever done it.
[105:02.84]Alright, let's get it up.
[105:06.85]If those of you that aren't sticking around, thanks for hanging out.
[105:11.41]Sorry for the impromptu nonsense stream.
[105:15.35]You know what?
[105:15.93]We'll just do this.
[105:16.97]We'll put the starting soon thing on while I get it ready.
[105:19.68]Be right back.
[106:23.55]Alright.
[106:26.19]Let's move it over here.
[106:26.97]Skip.
[106:32.84]No, let's just do something generic.
[106:53.08]Something very generic.
[106:54.36]We're just doing this until I feel like going to take some medicine.
[106:57.24]Let's just do skill.
[106:59.12]Yeah, let's do professional.
[107:03.90]Appearance.
[107:05.26]Let's just do a random fucking face.
[107:08.59]Of course he's aged.
[107:10.13]Aged.
[107:11.79]Large head.
[107:14.07]And, uh, yeah, very large head.
[107:15.65]Very small chest.
[107:19.74]I'm only here for the starting soon screen.
[107:25.49]Well, it is very good starting soon screen.
[107:30.39]Witch, what?
[107:38.78]Kind of looks like a fucking witch.
[107:46.80]Okay, we're done.
[107:48.04]Good, that was fun.
[107:54.32]Alright, let's go.
[107:57.34]We're just making a random dumb guy.
[108:00.30]Oh shit, I gotta fucking change my... I gotta update my stream thing.
[108:05.36]Sick boy plays Bloodborne.
[108:08.35]We're not gonna play it for very long.
[108:09.53]I don't know how many times I have to say that shit.
[108:14.19]Before I, like, don't say it anymore.
[108:15.89]You're not gonna do it for long.
[108:16.81]We're not gonna do it for long.
[108:17.65]We're gonna play Bloodborne not for very long, though.
[108:21.73]Good.
[108:22.74]Okay, zero hit run.
[108:23.94]Here we go.
[108:24.28]You guys ready?
[108:26.56]My PB is 41 minutes.
[108:30.54]No hits.
[108:33.30]Soul level zero.
[108:34.50]Here we go.
[108:39.30]Not really, though.
[108:39.96]Alright, let's do it.
[108:41.42]If you guys don't know this game, this is the FromSoftware, the guys that made Dark Souls.
[108:48.42]Seven hours later.
[108:49.30]Alright, speed run.
[108:51.74]Here we go.
[108:56.30]See how fast I just did that?
[108:57.28]Alright, I dare you to hit me.
[109:06.40]No, no, no.
[109:06.82]Yeah, just die.
[109:07.36]I gotta die.
[109:07.82]Quick, quick, quick.
[109:08.24]Kill me.
[109:08.48]This is a speedrun.
[109:09.50]Kill me.
[109:09.80]Quick, quick, quick.
[109:15.26]Come on.
[109:15.48]This is supposed to be a speedrun.
[109:16.40]Hurry up and kill me.
[109:22.46]Put on your splits.
[109:27.82]I have to reset.
[109:29.70]Ah, damn it.
[109:36.64]That was worth a shot.
[109:44.64]Oh, hi.
[109:45.98]Oh, no, it's a doll.
[109:46.68]Yeah, we're gonna go... We're gonna do Sawcleaver, because Sawcleaver is... Maybe we can do Cain.
[109:54.56]Cain sucks, though.
[109:59.30]No, we'll just do Sawcleaver for now.
[110:02.13]You know what?
[110:02.63]Fuck it.
[110:02.91]We'll do the cane.
[110:03.89]Who cares, right?
[110:12.69]So, if you don't know how Bloodborne works, I'll tell you.
[110:15.51]This is why it's fucking cool.
[110:18.25]Blunderbuss.
[110:21.84]Dark Souls copy.
[110:24.30]It's made by the same guys, man.
[110:25.48]Alright, the reason why Bloodborne is awesome...
[110:30.03]This will get you guys ready to go.
[110:33.83]So, there's not very many weapons in Bloodborne.
[110:37.31]But, oh shit, I just realized it's set to 60 FPS and it's only showing at 30.
[110:40.07]Oh well.
[110:43.13]Every single weapon in Bloodborne, even though there's less than 25 of them or 30 of them in the game, they can all do this.
[110:52.71]They turn into different weapons, pretty much.
[110:55.79]They're called trick weapons.
[110:58.60]Which allow you to have like two completely different play styles.
[111:03.30]At the same time.
[111:05.46]It's very cool.
[111:07.22]I wish they put it in Dark Souls 3.
[111:10.01]But they didn't.
[111:12.01]For some reason.
[111:20.79]Can I act like I've never played the game before?
[111:22.33]Yeah, sure.
[111:22.83]Okay.
[111:24.87]Let's act like I've never played the game.
[111:26.90]Here it comes.
[111:34.30]I sure got tricked.
[111:35.08]What are these loading screens?
[111:38.04]Come on.
[111:38.80]Peggle 2 didn't have these loading screens.
[111:41.43]Should have played Peggle 2.
[111:42.69]Alright.
[111:47.51]Let's go kill this thing.
[111:52.77]Hey, bad guy.
[111:54.82]Okay.
[112:04.26]Come here, I gotta look good.
[112:05.36]Come here, I need to look good for my stream.
[112:13.46]Oh, fuck it.
[112:13.94]I'm not gonna do the fancy shit.
[112:15.18]Just kill it.
[112:15.60]I wanted to parry it.
[112:21.24]Because you parry it with a gun in this game.
[112:25.73]Oh, shit.
[112:25.99]I'm supposed to not even know that.
[112:29.91]Trying to show off and it's gonna give me guilt.
[112:34.91]Should you pre-order this game?
[112:35.91]Absolutely.
[112:37.51]Pre-order Bloodborne.
[112:43.71]There are girls watching?
[112:48.36]Yeah, you have to get hit there for the speedrun.
[112:49.88]You gotta get, like, two times.
[112:53.72]Alright, let me try to, like, remember where everything is.
[112:56.34]No, what the fuck?
[112:56.94]No!
[112:57.54]Oh, what was that?
[112:58.06]Blood vial?
[112:58.48]What do these do?
[112:59.66]Heal?
[113:00.10]Cool.
[113:02.10]This game's kinda cool.
[113:05.41]Whoa, watch out!
[113:06.23]Shit!
[113:08.51]This guy almost fucking got me.
[113:13.57]What is that?
[113:13.95]Is it like a werewolf?
[113:16.37]Interesting!
[113:23.66]Holy shit, look, this guy's like waking up.
[113:25.14]Oh, interesting!
[113:33.40]I've never play.
[113:33.98]I've never played the game.
[113:34.70]I'm just oh fuck.
[113:36.00]I'm so used to playing Dark Souls That like triangle is to switch weapons not l1 Take a look at this frog for one second just one second.
[113:49.10]How is the audio too low?
[113:50.10]How is it?
[113:53.02]What's that?
[113:55.64]Wow Did you hear that shit?
[113:58.06]It was like a screaming guy oh?
[114:02.18]I think I might need to turn it up a little bit.
[114:03.48]I don't think I even can.
[114:08.70]I need a face cam?
[114:10.33]I look like shit right now.
[114:12.41]I don't think you guys understand how fucking bad I look.
[114:24.65]Alright, this guy is a bad guy.
[114:28.42]He's a bad guy.
[114:29.24]Yeah!
[114:29.48]Yeah!
[114:30.06]Yeah!
[114:32.53]No, I don't even know.
[114:33.47]Who is that?
[114:33.83]I don't even know.
[114:34.31]Who cares?
[114:39.31]Don't you know this is a Dark Souls game?
[114:41.26]You don't even, like, you just skip everything.
[114:42.58]Speedrun.
[114:42.98]I need to turn up the voices, though, if I'm gonna play this game.
[114:46.78]Alright, let's go.
[114:56.62]Dude, I'm sick, too.
[114:57.78]You guys, I don't think you guys understand how terrible I look.
[115:01.98]I look like a zero out of ten right now.
[115:04.37]That was weird.
[115:07.35]Something that this game does that Dark Souls doesn't do is called a rally system.
[115:13.27]Hit me.
[115:14.61]Watch my health.
[115:18.58]You can refill your health bar by attacking enemies in a certain period after you get hit.
[115:23.76]See the little thing up there?
[115:26.08]Pretty cool.
[115:27.45]It's called a rally system.
[115:35.46]There's a lot of guys down here.
[115:36.62]Come upstairs.
[115:49.41]Come on.
[115:51.51]Come on, you piece of shit.
[115:53.87]Bring your friend, too.
[115:54.95]Bring your brother.
[115:55.77]Bring your siblings.
[116:08.98]Uh, the whip, I think, is the... I think the worst weapon in the whole game.
[116:12.63]But, it's okay.
[116:14.57]This is a... Because this is a speedrun.
[116:21.27]Oh, why?
[116:21.72]Oh, why?
[116:22.14]Yeah, this game has got the best voice lines from enemies.
[116:25.70]It's great.
[116:26.86]Alright, let's go get our ass kicked by the guy that's down here.
[116:31.39]Alright, let's see.
[116:31.92]Let's see if I'm good at this game.
[116:33.92]See if I remember.
[116:41.65]This guy's bad.
[116:42.47]He's scary and he kills you in like one hit.
[116:46.63]Like that.
[116:59.33]Ha!
[116:59.45]The cane is fantastic.
[117:01.77]I hate the cane.
[117:04.16]I really don't like the cane.
[117:09.40]It's cool.
[117:10.30]The cane is really fucking cool.
[117:11.58]I don't know.
[117:13.06]I like high damage weapons.
[117:14.58]But we're doing a skill build for some weird reason.
[117:16.57]Don't ask me why.
[117:17.39]Is there anything even over there?
[117:22.37]I don't think there's anything even on that side.
[117:25.35]Top 10 gaming speedruns.
[117:28.56]As a joke, I was gonna put that in the title.
[117:31.16]But that would be so stupid because people like actually watch... I watch them.
[117:35.90]Like Dark Souls speedruns and Bloodborne speedruns.
[117:39.56]And... If you came to this stream thinking it was a speedrun, you would... You'd be very upset about it.
[117:43.74]You'd be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[117:45.82]This ain't a speedrun.
[117:46.66]That leads back here.
[117:47.36]Kind of a useless skip.
[117:48.64]Doesn't need to exist.
[117:52.34]Where's Peggle 2?
[117:53.30]I came for Peggle 2.
[117:56.47]We're doing this until I die, and then I'm... Once I die, it's over.
[118:04.31]Don't worry.
[118:05.45]This is a fucking speedrun.
[118:06.29]You know what happens when the speedrunner dies?
[118:08.67]He runs over.
[118:09.61]Alright, you ready?
[118:15.41]I'm gonna get this item.
[118:16.91]Oh, cool, an item.
[118:18.89]Whoa!
[118:20.73]Got you, huh?
[118:21.25]It's scary, huh?
[118:25.07]Did you shit your pants?
[118:25.83]I shit my pants.
[118:29.59]Whoa!
[118:33.75]Permadeath run.
[118:36.05]Add funny music.
[118:39.07]No, no funny music.
[118:46.50]You're coming up here, aren't you?
[118:47.50]Ooh, lots of ya!
[118:50.44]Lots of ya!
[118:52.42]Nah, I got greedy, but it works.
[119:00.03]My girlfriend's shit her pants, too.
[119:01.91]Shit!
[119:02.47]Oh my god, that's gonna kill me.
[119:05.73]The fact that Triangle is mapped... It's the same... In Dark Souls, that's how you switch your weapon to two-handed or one-handed.
[119:13.80]I'm gonna complain about that, like, ten more times.
[119:16.60]I promise.
[119:19.20]Want me to get Acid Base on here?
[119:20.56]I can't... How am I gonna do that?
[119:23.50]Kane is bad.
[119:25.70]The cane is bad.
[119:27.56]Just watch when I fight a boss.
[119:28.84]It's going to take me like a thousand years to do it.
[119:40.69]I'm getting these souls pretty much for no reason.
[119:43.64]You can't even level up unless you go very far into the game.
[119:46.46]Get it on YouTube?
[119:49.58]No, we asset base in a boss.
[119:57.67]Just get up the stairs.
[120:02.57]Get up the stairs.
[120:04.11]Come on, please.
[120:05.01]I don't want to go down there.
[120:08.43]I don't want to get shot by the dumb guy that kills you instantly when you're dumb.
[120:13.17]There's dogs down here and shit too.
[120:14.83]I'm going to pull out.
[120:18.22]It would be very bad if I died here.
[120:19.38]I want to go around this way.
[120:21.04]I want to aggro them.
[120:22.46]Alright, come on.
[120:23.76]Aggro.
[120:25.26]No, no, we'll do this.
[120:27.85]Mm-hmm.
[120:38.77]This is Dark Souls PvP.
[120:39.65]He's holding block forever.
[120:43.58]What?
[120:43.96]Bullshit.
[120:44.32]We didn't do that.
[120:53.09]Get whipped!
[120:57.51]Pro speedrun strat is aggroing them one by one as slow as possible.
[121:01.76]Well, it's also the stay alive strat too, so I'm okay with that.
[121:10.01]cold uh cold broodoo or whatever the hell it's called you know yourself that's the uh equivalent in the game to the little soul crunchies whatever they're called called crunchos come here you little come here dog on the stairs I don't like it
[121:42.34]Go, go, go.
[121:43.22]I think there's an item down here.
[121:48.36]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[121:49.86]Why are you not shooting?
[121:52.04]Okay.
[121:52.28]I thought there was a guy there.
[121:57.96]And let's get this item right here.
[122:00.42]Okay, I got the item.
[122:02.32]What the?
[122:02.64]Whoa!
[122:03.24]Oh, someone's coming in the door!
[122:05.42]Whoa!
[122:06.46]Oh my fuck!
[122:07.96]Intensity.
[122:12.50]It's the copy-paste enemy dog from Dark Souls.
[122:18.71]Time for the hourly failfish.
[122:20.03]How have I failfished?
[122:21.21]I haven't done anything wrong.
[122:22.09]A long time ago, I posted a link to funny music.
[122:28.84]We're doing the funny music when we get to the first boss.
[122:31.18]And then I'll die to the first boss and we can all laugh.
[122:33.62]Because I hate skill builds in every Dark Souls type game.
[122:43.63]Even though they're very scary and they're very loud.
[122:54.92]And something, some lore to note here.
[122:57.72]We're in central Yharnam right now.
[123:00.70]That's it.
[123:01.06]That's the lore.
[123:02.64]You hear the music box there?
[123:05.06]That's the lore.
[123:08.13]Here's the guy that's banging on the door.
[123:09.27]What do we do about this guy?
[123:11.74]Uh-oh, what's up?
[123:18.43]Dex build.
[123:19.03]I don't like dex builds either.
[123:21.69]I usually do strength.
[123:25.75]Although I think I did a dex build on my Dark Souls 3 for my first character.
[123:29.26]Just kind of scared.
[123:34.92]Move over, baddie.
[123:39.39]Alright, let's die to the Cleric Beast.
[123:41.79]Spoiler alert, it's the Cleric Beast.
[123:44.69]I mean, you're like, kind of, sort of, slightly, kind of supposed to die to the Cleric Beast.
[123:52.11]Only because you can't level up until you die to the Cleric Beast.
[123:56.90]Hey!
[123:57.06]Whoa, scary!
[123:57.70]Actually, it did kind of scare me.
[124:01.26]I thought he was back there more.
[124:05.64]This is a tough pull.
[124:06.54]It's a tough pull here.
[124:13.25]Tough pull.
[124:13.79]Going balls in.
[124:27.62]Double tap.
[124:28.66]Easy.
[124:30.85]Tell us more lore.
[124:31.67]I don't know anything about lore in this game.
[124:36.77]Although, it does have a very interesting story.
[124:38.49]If you actually do care.
[124:41.47]If you actually care about story, there is a good one.
[124:47.05]This part is fucking horrible, though.
[124:48.93]And I actually might die here.
[124:52.33]It is possible for me to die here, because these are too hard enemies.
[124:55.67]Let me open up some first.
[124:59.83]Let me get it.
[125:00.63]Where is it?
[125:00.93]Down here?
[125:02.95]Is this to go to... No, it's an item, though.
[125:06.98]Shitty pebbles.
[125:08.04]Yep.
[125:12.00]Speedrun it.
[125:12.58]I actually want to go open the door because I probably will die here.
[125:18.10]I'm rusty.
[125:20.19]If I can get a good parry on this one.
[125:23.01]Alright, time to put on the gloves.
[125:31.66]Oh, come on.
[125:32.26]Bullshit.
[125:35.08]No, no, no, no.
[125:45.28]Wee!
[125:47.22]That, ladies and gentlemen, is why this place sucks.
[125:54.81]And that's why this fucking item sucks.
[126:08.92]See ya!
[126:16.19]We'll come back later.
[126:16.95]I can open the door over here.
[126:24.78]Don't worry, I can get this.
[126:30.32]What?
[126:30.92]What?
[126:31.58]Why did that not... I did it.
[126:33.11]Why did it not do the animation?
[126:34.93]Bullshit.
[126:37.79]There we go.
[126:40.15]No acid base, I know.
[126:41.53]That's why.
[126:43.61]That's why I couldn't do it.
[126:46.80]You are right.
[126:49.60]Give me my free shit.
[126:57.23]It's first time play.
[126:58.45]Yeah, it's my first time playing ever.
[126:59.87]I don't know like all the ins and outs.
[127:03.17]I don't know like what all these things do.
[127:12.51]This opens this thing up, which allows you to very quickly go to the next area.
[127:17.67]But we're just going to get it open.
[127:23.64]Oh, somebody gave some money here.
[127:24.78]Hold on.
[127:28.28]Laddie596, 14 months.
[127:31.62]Hey, friend over here.
[127:33.46]Thanks for the 14 months, dude.
[127:34.52]Over a year, Laddie.
[127:38.09]Uh, Psychoblat 2015 for 10 months.
[127:41.15]What a vile sniffler trying to be Etalyx on the WoW stream.
[127:44.21]It was actually MLC stealth.
[127:46.11]But yeah.
[127:47.59]Here's one for you.
[127:48.99]Sucan, thanks for the sub.
[127:50.25]PattyD, thanks for the two months.
[127:52.56]OverlySensual, thank you for three months.
[127:56.04]Uh, AnamusedWalrus, thanks for two months.
[128:00.86]Prenn, thanks for five months.
[128:03.40]I'm gonna puke again.
[128:04.10]What's with being like this puke shit?
[128:08.00]It was Daintek that gave the $15, 1500 bits.
[128:11.42]Show us you're the real lore master.
[128:14.00]With the winking Kappa.
[128:15.34]That's fucking awesome.
[128:19.32]Cakeless Knight, thanks for the 100 bits.
[128:21.32]Hand Shoes for 500 bits.
[128:22.74]When's the Mario speedrun stream?
[128:24.36]Didn't Mario come out with a new game for mobile?
[128:26.87]Mario Run?
[128:29.07]I think that's what it was called.
[128:30.55]Like, this sucks because I have to go, actually.
[128:32.31]You can't level up until you die to the first boss.
[128:34.49]I'm not even sure why I'm doing all this.
[128:35.68]I should just run to the first boss immediately.
[128:38.42]Uh, but thanks for the bits, guys.
[128:39.50]Thank you, Handshoes.
[128:40.72]And thank you, uh, Lanot for the bits.
[128:42.84]And MambaBits.
[128:43.86]Bits, bits, bits, bits, lots of bits.
[128:46.74]And Mr. Man.
[128:47.94]Thank you for three months.
[128:48.68]Be funny or riot.
[128:50.21]Okay, fine.
[128:57.53]Didn't kill me.
[128:58.07]Okay, never mind.
[129:01.17]Okay, never mind.
[129:02.01]I tried to be funny.
[129:04.59]Never mind.
[129:14.95]Can I open the door here?
[129:15.79]I don't think I can.
[129:20.42]It has to be open from the other side.
[129:21.46]Oh, maybe not.
[129:22.04]No, I can open it from here.
[129:22.82]This is a quick way to get here.
[129:30.85]I thought I was going to die.
[129:34.35]I really shouldn't be getting all this stuff.
[129:35.77]It's fucking stupid.
[129:38.97]You really just need to sprint to the first boss.
[129:42.60]I could have opened that.
[129:43.36]I don't care.
[129:44.02]Let's just go die to the first boss already.
[129:47.58]Let's have no confidence and lose to the first boss.
[130:00.78]Time is the Peggle 2 stream.
[130:01.98]Joseph.
[130:04.05]Joseph of Aromanthia.
[130:05.85]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[130:07.33]You missed it.
[130:08.57]You missed the Peggle 2 stream already.
[130:11.37]Sorry.
[130:13.47]Thanks for the $10, dude.
[130:15.95]Much appreciated.
[130:16.98]So, we got it on this side.
[130:18.34]Now we don't have to deal with the two assholes.
[130:20.88]Let's go lose to the cleric pieces.
[130:22.10]It's going to be fun.
[130:24.22]I can get some bits from these guys.
[130:25.90]Some bits.
[130:26.50]Some fucking vials.
[130:36.92]Scream or Peggle, too?
[130:37.82]I plan on it.
[130:38.24]Peggle, too, is just one of those games you can just chill and play, like I said earlier.
[130:47.04]Easy just to kind of kill and do it.
[130:50.55]Alright, here we go.
[130:51.45]Let's go lose.
[130:55.35]What's down here?
[130:56.81]It's like a dead end?
[130:57.51]Nah, it's just a dead end, guys.
[131:01.16]I guess I'll see if there's any items.
[131:03.28]What is that thing?
[131:03.96]It's a giant alien!
[131:05.94]It's... It's cleric bait!
[131:13.23]Look at how much damage I'm doing.
[131:14.33]This is going to take a thousand fucking years.
[131:37.96]I hate this weapon.
[131:42.17]Nope.
[131:48.47]Nope.
[131:57.26]Here we go.
[131:57.82]Kill me.
[131:58.80]Kill me so I can level up in this game.
[132:11.57]Does it give me more damage when I hit him with this?
[132:15.33]Not by very much.
[132:29.86]Hear that bell clock?
[132:35.50]Cartoon music!
[132:36.14]Oh shit!
[132:37.00]Somebody put the link in the chat, quick!
[132:49.56]Dammit, come on.
[132:53.40]I'm so bad at parrying this guy because he's just too tall.
[133:02.38]He's gonna hit the enrage timer.
[133:13.52]Come on, you suck.
[133:14.86]You suck.
[133:22.56]Oh, he's got me!
[133:26.35]He's still alive.
[133:26.89]I thought that was an instant kill.
[133:35.67]Stuck on walls.
[133:37.19]We'll do it for the next attempt.
[133:40.23]I'm definitely not going to kill him here.
[133:52.49]Come on, what the fuck, why are there these enemies?
[134:08.81]Kill me already, so I can level up.
[134:12.33]I would appreciate it.
[134:13.11]He does have some pretty good monster sounds.
[134:34.38]I shouldn't have picked the fucking cane.
[134:37.86]You can't parry.
[134:38.42]No, you can't parry.
[134:39.08]You can stagger him, though.
[134:40.53]He was fire, right?
[134:46.73]Hey, look, because we died and we saw a boss.
[134:49.15]Take a look at the top right corner.
[134:52.62]We have an insight, which means now we can actually level up.
[134:55.96]So that's a mistake I made.
[134:57.24]Just not running to the Cleric Beast.
[134:59.92]I'm using the fucking cane.
[135:01.73]Well, speed runs over.
[135:02.57]I think I can upgrade the cane once or twice.
[135:11.99]Let's take a look.
[135:13.73]Hey, look, this guy.
[135:14.59]This is the Jerma.
[135:15.69]He's cool.
[135:19.49]It's three.
[135:19.93]I have two.
[135:20.57]I can't do it yet.
[135:27.15]Wait, how do you know?
[135:27.87]I thought this was your first time.
[135:28.93]Oh, uh... I have the wiki open over here.
[135:35.39]Is it an article?
[135:35.99]And you need, like, this shit too.
[135:37.29]There's a lot of early game things that need to happen in this game for you to succeed.
[135:44.34]Let's go.
[135:45.54]Let's do it again.
[135:49.84]No, no, ah, wrong place.
[135:53.86]Garmin?
[135:56.53]Did I miss the fight with Gas Quack?
[135:57.99]Nah, I just started playing, like, 20 minutes ago, 30 months ago.
[136:02.27]Thank you, I never hold, I never fold for 10 months.
[136:07.29]You don't need that armor?
[136:08.17]Oh, you, come on, it makes it easier.
[136:09.93]I should have just picked the Saw Cleaver like a good boy.
[136:29.35]Alright, where's Acid Base?
[136:30.71]So I can play it on my next attempt.
[136:40.43]Upgraded Peggle 2 graphics.
[136:45.47]Axe is the best.
[136:46.67]The Axe is amazing early game.
[136:49.12]Like, you will shred Cleric Beast with the Axe.
[136:56.16]Let me see.
[137:00.38]I can't believe this is online.
[137:03.32]Can you guys even, like, hear this shit?
[137:05.84]Oh.
[137:08.68]Oh, god.
[137:12.48]Saw cleaver is boring.
[137:13.99]Yeah, that's why I picked the cane, because... I don't know, I figured maybe it'd be fun, but... I don't think I'm, like, good enough at this game to, like, utilize the cane, because it's fucking trash.
[137:27.51]It was so loud.
[137:29.91]I couldn't even hear it.
[137:30.95]Why can I not hear it?
[137:34.67]Let me see.
[137:36.07]Louder?
[137:44.82]How's that?
[137:48.64]Is that a good volume?
[137:55.52]Alright, there we go.
[137:56.94]I'll get this ready.
[138:00.14]Um, I need blood vials now.
[138:02.06]These guys are easy to farm for vials.
[138:03.60]I'm just gonna farm these guys and then... put some points in and then go fight plenty.
[138:10.37]Do it louder?
[138:10.97]You guys really want it to be louder than that?
[138:28.67]Max it out.
[138:29.29]I don't think I want to do that.
[138:40.34]Don't worry.
[138:40.82]I'll make it.
[138:41.26]I'll make it.
[138:41.66]Oh, fuck.
[138:42.18]I thought I killed him.
[138:48.29]Coins?
[138:49.85]What is this dog shit with coins here?
[138:51.73]Come on.
[138:55.29]There is the skip, but I don't have it.
[138:58.03]I think I actually might just go down and just fuck the Cleric Beast for now.
[139:03.75]Gas coin is actually probably arguably easier than the Cleric Beast.
[139:09.71]Depends on how you play it.
[139:16.70]Hurry up before these dogs get out of their cages!
[139:26.08]Oh, come on.
[139:36.49]I need the coins.
[139:37.35]I need the coins!
[139:42.32]And there's like NPCs in this game just like there are in Dark Souls.
[139:46.30]You knock, knock, knock on the door and you can interact with them, talk to them, you know, the whole nine yards.
[139:51.76]No!
[139:56.28]Oh, my throat is actually starting to really fucking hurt right now.
[140:02.54]Oh, BabyRage.
[140:07.32]I might have enough cold dues now to actually level up without needing to get my souls back.
[140:11.08]But let's just keep going.
[140:12.49]Oh, BabyRage.
[140:13.33]Oh, my throat hurts.
[140:14.81]Where?
[140:19.93]Oh, my throat hurts.
[140:20.87]Where?
[140:21.25]Here's an interesting thing.
[140:24.13]Look at this.
[140:25.19]Cool, huh?
[140:27.34]There's something in the door.
[140:29.20]This person over here.
[140:33.86]Ooh, wait a minute.
[140:34.48]Who's up here?
[140:36.85]Oh, you're a hunter.
[140:41.44]Yes, I am a hunter.
[140:43.46]This is Eileen the crow.
[140:48.66]I only know that because I looked over at my Wikipedia page.
[140:52.74]She gives you a quest.
[140:56.40]To do a bunch of stuff, like any Dark Souls game.
[140:58.70]And if I attack her... Kill her right now.
[141:01.50]That's not gonna happen.
[141:03.10]I would need to parry and visceral attack her like 40 times.
[141:08.09]I'm not good enough at this fucking game to do that.
[141:10.55]No.
[141:11.93]That's how you start it, villain.
[141:19.52]Let's get this.
[141:20.80]Let's get the cold brew do.
[141:22.14]I only knew that was there because, like I told you, I have my game shark open next to me.
[141:29.26]Let's go kill that guy.
[141:32.13]Let's just go down there.
[141:32.97]Careful now.
[141:46.94]Easy, easy.
[141:49.06]And be careful down there.
[141:49.84]There's rats.
[141:50.82]Just like every other game that has... This is gonna kill me.
[141:54.72]Hopefully it doesn't.
[141:55.36]Give me your vials.
[142:08.61]I need them.
[142:09.33]I need them bad.
[142:10.21]I need them bad, bro.
[142:19.70]He just said, motherfucker.
[142:22.37]Did you hear it?
[142:24.05]I heard it.
[142:28.49]Hey, you.
[142:29.91]You with the funny face.
[142:39.65]Somebody gave pits.
[142:45.76]Those are some slow bullets.
[142:48.33]Yeah, they can be very finicky, too.
[142:50.69]You'll try to parry somebody and you'll, like, shoot over their head.
[142:53.41]Or, like, to the left or the right of them.
[142:56.65]Gotta get better at that shit.
[142:58.31]Alright.
[143:04.86]Let's go over there.
[143:09.32]What do you call a funny face?
[143:11.48]That guy kinda has a funny face.
[143:14.54]Alright, I should have enough to level up now.
[143:17.19]At least a couple times.
[143:19.70]And then we'll go lose to the cleric beast again.
[143:23.14]Actually, I'm just gonna get this skip.
[143:25.00]To the gas coin.
[143:25.82]Why not?
[143:27.22]We're already down here.
[143:27.94]Might as well.
[143:31.48]Did I miss anything up here?
[143:32.68]I don't think so.
[143:33.34]Make sure you're gonna have funny noises.
[143:38.45]Every time you do something, like, different... Ah, wrong side.
[143:40.75]Fuck me.
[143:45.23]Oh, the Saw Spear!
[143:46.21]Saw Spear!
[143:46.79]I forgot about the Saw Spear.
[143:47.63]We can play the game.
[143:49.59]Watch out for the rats.
[143:54.11]I completely forgot the Saw Spear existed.
[143:55.69]Never mind, we're good.
[143:57.07]Game on.
[143:59.57]Saw Spear is like the best weapon in the whole game.
[144:01.39]So, yeah, we're fine.
[144:02.17]Wait, what?
[144:16.84]Rats, rats, rats, rats.
[144:18.76]And I'm gonna go back to, uh, after I get the skip.
[144:21.65]Sawspear, where are you?
[144:23.53]Look at you!
[144:24.07]Look at you, Sawspear.
[144:26.39]I love the Sawspear.
[144:27.47]It's so good!
[144:29.01]Alright, I'm using the Sawspear.
[144:37.35]Fuck the cane.
[144:37.87]The cane's gone.
[144:40.83]I know, I lose, like, scaling with the- I just- this item's just much better.
[144:46.14]The sauce bear.
[144:47.52]Alright, let's go back this way.
[144:50.32]I want to kill the guys, get some souls.
[144:53.70]Sauce bear!
[144:56.88]Everybody loves the sauce bear.
[144:58.68]See, it's a very good, quick weapon, and you can flip it out to turn it into the thing, into the giant butter knife.
[145:06.13]Whoa!
[145:10.25]If you want to cleave, it's got a pretty good attack.
[145:15.28]Sauce Bear.
[145:16.18]Alright, let me see.
[145:17.04]Thanks.
[145:19.56]Special thanks to Obey the Kitten with the 150 bits.
[145:22.58]Thanks.
[145:22.76]You make this game look easy.
[145:23.68]I just started playing it.
[145:25.26]I've... This is like one of my favorite games of all time.
[145:28.31]So... If I'm like rushing through zones and areas, I've beaten this game probably six times.
[145:36.43]This is like in my top five best games ever made.
[145:40.28]Ever made.
[145:40.70]So... If that's why, that's why.
[145:44.88]Cakeless Knight.
[145:45.52]A thousand bits.
[145:46.18]Sauce beer.
[145:46.84]Where is it?
[145:47.30]I can't see.
[145:49.79]Thanks a lot, Cake.
[145:53.15]A fine specimen.
[145:54.05]Thanks for the bits.
[145:55.51]Puking Victory.
[145:56.71]Put on the damn cartoon music.
[145:57.93]I will when we get to the boss.
[145:58.71]Don't worry.
[146:01.67]And Subwise, thank you to Inkbite.
[146:04.26]For the new sub.
[146:04.90]Dampy123 for three months.
[146:06.38]Just watched Rogue One.
[146:07.38]Such a good movie.
[146:09.20]Having that amazing wow feeling that you get after watching a movie.
[146:14.79]My eyes glossed over.
[146:15.75]I just couldn't read.
[146:19.37]Just watched Rogue One.
[146:20.49]Such a good movie.
[146:21.03]Having that amazing wow feeling that you get after you watch an amazing movie at the moment.
[146:24.67]At least the second half of the movie.
[146:25.79]Well, that's good to know.
[146:26.43]Because there was potential for that movie to bomb.
[146:32.10]But thanks a lot, Dan.
[146:34.68]Bada bing, it's Ben.
[146:35.64]Thanks for two months, never full for ten months.
[146:37.26]Lizbian69.
[146:39.65]Oldramon, MrMan165.
[146:42.31]Thanks for your subscriptions, guys.
[146:47.11]Thanks!
[146:50.78]What does this lead to?
[146:51.88]Don't forget.
[146:54.10]RogueOne is out.
[146:55.94]Is it out?
[146:56.96]I thought it comes out like tomorrow.
[146:58.42]No, yeah, it's out.
[146:59.98]It's out, boys.
[147:01.54]Boys and girls.
[147:05.46]I think this actually just leads up to where I was.
[147:07.24]Yeah, it does.
[147:10.47]Could have gone this way, but, you know.
[147:13.15]Those souls and all.
[147:16.37]Come on, get it out of your system.
[147:18.65]Get it out of your system.
[147:23.64]Come on, get it out of your system.
[147:27.96]Isn't there, uh, boxes and shit you can break through down here?
[147:31.30]I think there is.
[147:31.84]Leads you to a secret.
[147:33.96]Hey, shithead!
[147:39.42]Ah, this opens up the back door here.
[147:42.24]You can talk to the... daughter.
[147:50.11]Only eight blood vials.
[147:51.17]How the fuck did that happen?
[147:53.59]You liked it more than the Force Awakens, really?
[147:58.24]Well, that's pretty good.
[147:59.68]That's good to hear.
[148:05.26]I'm glad it's good.
[148:07.21]All this does is you can talk to this girl here.
[148:09.79]For people that haven't played this game, I'm not going to spoil all this shit.
[148:14.77]But there's certain things you can do.
[148:16.83]I don't want to fucking ruin your experience, though, by just being a speed boy.
[148:24.04]It's a very good game.
[148:25.62]But I want to stay down here.
[148:30.34]The armor... There's an armor redesign?
[148:34.54]In The Force Awakens, really.
[148:37.71]Did I do the secret thing over there?
[148:39.95]No, I didn't.
[148:40.29]Who cares?
[148:43.85]What was the armor redesign?
[148:45.01]There's a bunch of little shit.
[148:52.39]Wicked, wicked easy enemies to kill down here.
[148:54.26]And they probably give a lot of souls.
[148:55.46]If I remember correctly, so it's gonna be.
[149:01.23]I don't do very much damage right now, do I?
[149:04.62]If I die to these fucking simple enemies, I'm going to be very, very upset with myself.
[149:08.28]Remember the cane I talked about hating so much?
[149:13.78]We're going to put it back on.
[149:15.22]Mm-hmm.
[149:32.67]Talk about wasting vials, because it's so stupidly easy.
[149:35.70]I'm like touching the hands, just barely.
[149:42.28]Wait, what?
[149:51.42]Wait, what?
[149:53.44]At least I got my vial back.
[149:55.20]Oh, there's two more of these weirdos with the hats.
[150:03.26]We're fighting over some BULLETS!
[150:05.10]In certain situations, the cane ain't bad, but for an actual do damage weapon, it's not.
[150:23.45]This sick boy made his channel look real good.
[150:25.63]Oh, you like it?
[150:26.47]Good.
[150:26.69]I'm glad people like it.
[150:28.83]It's only gonna get better.
[150:36.13]Shit, I thought it was open for some reason.
[150:45.35]No!
[150:45.65]Quit that shit, man!
[150:53.96]And I don't know why I'm not using the best fucking weapon in the game, the Hunter Axe.
[150:59.30]This is the best weapon in the game, but the Hunter Axe is the best weapon in the game.
[151:01.98]You know what I mean?
[151:03.78]You know what I mean, Varden?
[151:04.90]I can't use that anymore.
[151:06.32]Stop saying that.
[151:08.28]Come on, come down on me.
[151:09.43]You would have scared me if this was my first time playing.
[151:11.35]Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[151:21.41]Well, look, more assholes.
[151:25.28]Look at those birds.
[151:32.51]Look at what's down that hallway.
[151:36.59]I see something.
[151:40.44]Something scary.
[151:42.44]What the fuck am I doing?
[151:44.44]Am I doing drugs today?
[151:50.19]I had like two doses of NyQuil over the last like 12 hours.
[151:54.49]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[151:57.53]See, look at this guy.
[151:58.09]Look at this guy right here.
[152:00.05]Uh-oh.
[152:01.23]I think he might just kill me.
[152:03.41]Here he comes.
[152:06.98]Hey!
[152:07.68]Hey!
[152:10.10]I'm gonna get you!
[152:13.24]Holy shit.
[152:13.82]I didn't dodge that?
[152:14.40]Why did it look like I dodged that?
[152:19.28]That's his ass.
[152:24.18]Come on, I gotta get it.
[152:25.66]I gotta show you guys like the thing you can do to the pigs.
[152:29.86]Super important.
[152:33.57]Right up his asshole.
[152:42.44]Bye, pig.
[152:42.78]And there's the Saw Hunter badge that unlocks stuff in the store.
[152:45.98]A little cold blue dude.
[152:50.48]Good.
[152:50.86]I need it.
[152:56.72]And then there's a secret down here.
[152:58.60]You gotta get right- Don't fucking do it as a joke.
[153:03.96]See, on your first playthrough of this game, you'll just walk straight and be like, Oh, there's something-
[153:11.42]And you're the Goofy from the Disney Channel.
[153:16.32]Not me.
[153:17.66]I've played this game before.
[153:18.54]I think there's actually armor up here.
[153:28.14]Is this a fresh playthrough?
[153:29.02]This is a... I don't want to call it a playthrough because I'm not sure if I'm going to play this whole game, but... This is a... This is a fresh game.
[153:39.05]Gas coin?
[153:44.67]What?
[153:46.01]What?
[153:47.89]Okay, what the fuck was that?
[153:51.10]I want to get Skip before I fight Gas coin.
[153:53.30]Skip is back here.
[153:58.32]Down this way.
[154:00.32]Boulder is over here, but we missed it.
[154:01.88]We didn't get hit by it.
[154:04.84]We're going to go level up, and then we're going to try to fight Mr. Cleric Beast.
[154:11.62]And lose again, and then be sad.
[154:13.87]Because we keep losing.
[154:16.55]Alright, there it is.
[154:18.51]Hey, remember that elevator that was over here?
[154:19.75]Oh, look at that.
[154:22.66]This game has guns?
[154:23.52]Yes.
[154:25.36]There are quite a few of them, actually.
[154:30.35]Quite a few of them.
[154:38.21]And by quite a few, I mean, like, they don't really do a whole lot.
[154:41.57]I think there's only one... If you level up the Bloodtinge stat, which is the stat that scales damage on your firearms, if you level the absolute hell out of that and get, like, the best highest damage weapon in the game, I still don't think it's any good.
[155:01.35]Dark Souls with werewolves and guns.
[155:04.34]But better than Dark Souls, in my opinion.
[155:07.80]I think this is the best game that FromSoftware ever made.
[155:11.34]You know?
[155:14.70]Bunch of people will disagree with me on that.
[155:17.28]But I think you give this to people on PC at 60 FPS with one more DLC pack.
[155:22.60]I think I've said this in the past.
[155:24.59]But if there was like one more batch of DLC for this game, not only are you talking like game of the year, you're talking like this is like a thousand times better than any of the Dark Souls games.
[155:34.96]But opinions are like things on your butt.
[155:37.97]Everybody's got one, right?
[155:39.85]Funny jokes here.
[155:49.41]Let's eat them all.
[155:50.07]Alright, how many times can we level up?
[155:53.27]What are we leveling up?
[155:54.21]Let's do this right.
[155:56.14]I need, obviously, well, that's a tiny amount of vitality.
[156:00.48]Let's do... Yeah, this is the Firelink keeper lady.
[156:05.18]How many times can I level up?
[156:07.60]Quite a few.
[156:08.48]Let's go to 10 vitality.
[156:14.39]Um... Hold on.
[156:17.41]I want to see what this skill's with.
[156:19.43]Is this D and everything?
[156:23.05]Did I even get enough to do it?
[156:25.45]Shit, how did I not get another chunk?
[156:26.81]That's kind of bullshit.
[156:29.70]I'm going to put one point in strength and then a couple into decks just because I'm going to need it to equip certain weapons.
[156:42.06]That looks good.
[156:44.40]10, 10, 18.
[156:44.56]I think the most... You thought Dark Souls 3 was disappointing?
[156:54.38]Yeah, I don't think it was disappointing.
[156:55.70]I think that... I mean, it was a great game.
[156:59.50]I think Bloodborne is still a better experience.
[157:04.83]Dark Souls 1 is a little older and clunkier.
[157:07.49]That's... Yeah.
[157:08.33]Yeah.
[157:10.25]Dark Souls 1 is probably, like, the best game out of all of them, but it actually ends up not being the best out of all of them because it's just, like, old and clunky.
[157:20.88]How long am I going to stream?
[157:21.68]I need to go to bed?
[157:23.36]Um, probably not much longer.
[157:28.59]I've been going for about three hours.
[157:32.11]And I knew I wanted to have, like, a shorter stream today just so I could recover my voice and throat and everything, you know?
[157:40.15]Dark Souls 1 is overrated.
[157:44.84]It's, you know, I can't, it's hard to say that.
[157:47.52]And I'll tell you one reason why.
[157:48.66]Because Dark Souls 1 came out.
[157:53.42]It was like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls.
[157:56.99]And for its time, for like when it came out in what, like 2010?
[158:02.95]It's like comparing a game like Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3 to Dark Souls 1.
[158:07.42]There was a lot of shit that they improved going through the series.
[158:12.13]But, like, for its second in moment in history coming out, it was probably like, oh, wow, that's why people probably say, holy shit, it's the best game ever.
[158:19.85]Like, you don't have any idea.
[158:20.97]Like, five or six years ago, it was perfect.
[158:24.77]I never completed Dark Souls.
[158:26.32]I got really frustrated with Dark Souls.
[158:29.67]One.
[158:30.33]Just because you can't teleport until more than halfway through the game.
[158:32.90]And I find that to be... The word I'm looking for is annoying.
[158:37.18]But I don't want to say annoying because I don't want people to think I'm a jerk.
[158:42.10]I should buy some of that armor.
[158:45.12]Let's get the garb.
[158:56.43]I can sell something right now, right?
[158:59.84]So the cool part about... Well, it's both cool and bad at the same time.
[159:02.93]You can buy the healing potions in this game just from the vendor.
[159:08.57]I need those for the Bloodstarved Beast, but who... I'm not going to play against the Bloodstarved Beast.
[159:13.03]We're not going to get that far.
[159:16.87]Let me... No, that's what I just bought.
[159:19.67]Purchase.
[159:24.03]What gives me the most armor?
[159:25.11]Probably the hat.
[159:26.84]Yeah.
[159:31.26]The world is fabulous.
[159:35.48]I can agree with that.
[159:36.60]Like, Dark Souls is just designed so flawlessly, right?
[159:40.80]That's what people tend to say about it.
[159:43.38]Actually, I probably can level up.
[159:44.20]If I get rid of the cane, I can probably level up again.
[159:48.29]It's barely better.
[159:49.21]Okay.
[159:51.63]Let me... Unequip the cane.
[159:54.77]Fuck the cane.
[159:57.21]Get out of here, cane.
[159:58.07]Okay.
[159:58.87]Okay.
[160:07.12]The torch.
[160:10.10]I just think I can afford it all now.
[160:15.02]I can.
[160:17.96]And we'll buy blood vials.
[160:19.92]Alright.
[160:22.05]I'm ready to go fight the blood starved beast and lose.
[160:27.75]Because I'm not very good.
[160:29.55]I'm actually very fucking bad.
[160:36.35]I look cool now.
[160:37.17]I have interesting clothing.
[160:43.31]Thank you, Dovabed, for the two months.
[160:44.69]This used to be a Mayonnaise stream.
[160:46.80]Yeah, like a year ago.
[160:49.52]Ten years.
[160:50.58]Ten years.
[160:51.84]Ten months in a row for Mr. Squishy.
[160:53.54]Thanks, Mr. Squishy.
[160:56.92]Saint612, thank you for the sub.
[161:01.52]And... Cakeless Knight, thanks for the bits.
[161:04.40]Obey the Kitten, thanks for the bits.
[161:05.44]You make this game... Oh, I already got you, Cakeless.
[161:07.16]But, Cakeless, you've been... You've been throwing money around, dude.
[161:10.26]Thanks a lot.
[161:11.74]Why have you been streaming all day?
[161:12.94]I... I've only been going for a few hours, man.
[161:15.58]Not that long.
[161:17.50]Alright, let's do it.
[161:25.65]I need to pop my ears.
[161:28.05]Why don't you yawn to pop your ears, right?
[161:32.51]Fuck.
[161:34.83]Let's get to that point where it's... I'm starting to hear myself in my own head.
[161:40.83]Because I can't pop my ears.
[161:48.04]I wanted to play Bloodborne, but I can't get a PS4 now.
[161:53.54]Yeah, I just really wish.
[161:55.12]The game is so... Yeah, but I don't...
[161:58.91]This game is like so awesome.
[162:01.75]It's such a shame that they just wouldn't fucking put this on the other systems.
[162:07.47]Or on the PC.
[162:10.74]It's so good.
[162:12.04]Why?
[162:12.32]Just do it.
[162:15.56]Let us have it.
[162:16.20]I didn't even buy the lantern either.
[162:18.72]What a piece of shit, huh?
[162:27.89]oh wow that guy just how did you not hit me although I can't get my echoes let's get some more blood vials for storage I don't want to kill you the regular way your annoying old friends are really making this harder
[162:57.26]Who wants to fight you the normal way?
[162:58.78]Not me.
[163:10.09]One more little shit.
[163:13.31]Is this my first playthrough?
[163:14.29]No, it is not.
[163:16.26]I'm just kind of spending a little more time in it.
[163:18.82]Alright, hold on.
[163:19.60]I know.
[163:19.90]I won't forget the music.
[163:23.58]This is going to fuck me up, by the way.
[163:26.38]Blasting acid base is gonna make me lose.
[163:29.22]I'm gonna, like, miss dodges and die.
[163:31.87]Well, here we go.
[163:34.19]Oh, by the way, I have to beat him before the song is over, okay?
[163:37.96]Here we go.
[163:54.84]I fucking hate this song.
[163:56.72]Oh, it's so fucking loud.
[163:58.24]It's too loud.
[163:59.24]It's too loud.
[164:00.04]Too loud.
[165:31.05]Song's almost over!
[165:46.38]I'm rushing because the song's over.
[165:53.18]Song's over.
[165:53.61]I lose.
[165:54.89]It's gonna auto-play something.
[165:55.93]I don't know what it's gonna play.
[165:57.95]It's about to auto-play something.
[166:01.44]I don't know what it is, hopefully it's not something like bad.
[166:05.80]What the fuck is this thing?
[166:18.35]What is this thing?
[166:37.16]Not like this!
[166:50.45]Not like this!
[166:51.84]Not like this!
[167:03.73]I'm fucking crying.
[167:05.27]Die, please.
[167:13.82]It's the fucking movie.
[167:15.08]It's the stupid fucking movie.
[167:20.24]I can't fucking believe it, man.
[167:24.09]Why?
[167:25.29]Why?
[167:37.89]Oh, God.
[167:38.76]Well, Cleric Beasts.
[167:39.58]That's a Cleric Beast.
[167:42.36]He's kind of hard.
[167:43.70]Kind of.
[167:44.48]At the very first level.
[167:46.92]He's not that bad, though.
[167:54.91]Oh, my throat is killing me now.
[167:57.21]That fucking slayed me.
[168:07.56]Alright, let's try to go kill Gascoin and see if we can do it first try.
[168:11.58]It's just auto-played in the background.
[168:22.84]Thank you, Backdoor Bill, for the two months and the group for two months.
[168:27.24]Thanks a lot, guys.
[168:28.20]And CheesePizzaCat during that game of 10 bucks, 1,000 bits said AcidBase.
[168:33.70]That's the one.
[168:34.80]That is the one.
[168:37.87]Alright, let's go back and level up and then go.
[168:40.07]We already have the skip to go fight Gascoigne immediately.
[168:42.99]So, let's go do it.
[168:45.55]Let's go give it a try.
[168:54.04]God, that was perfect.
[168:59.15]Let's get... 12.
[168:59.57]Let's just do that.
[169:09.17]I didn't pick up another... Ah, shit.
[169:10.97]I shouldn't have done that.
[169:11.95]I need vials.
[169:13.05]Ah, fuck it.
[169:13.55]Let's try to fuck vial.
[169:16.20]Fuck the vials.
[169:16.92]You know what I'm saying?
[169:17.46]Let's see if we can kill Gascoigne with like 10.
[169:21.50]Ugh.
[169:28.37]I'll go for 11.
[169:31.71]He's parryable.
[169:35.69]And, okay.
[169:37.03]Let's go to Central Yharnam.
[169:38.67]Down to the skip.
[169:40.81]This isn't Peggle.
[169:42.49]Does it not say Sick Boy Plays Bloodborne?
[169:44.64]I thought it did.
[169:50.68]It says it on my screen right now that it's Bloodborne.
[170:03.96]It was like the burps and the farts that were getting me, man.
[170:06.22]All the farts and shit that were in those first couple movies that I made on the movies.
[170:13.54]Ugh.
[170:14.68]Alright, let's go beat Gascoigne without even trying, you know?
[170:21.67]Actually, I might be able to get another two or four vials from these guys.
[170:37.27]I never said I was.
[170:38.21]This is a very specific vomit, burp, fart, and puke stream.
[170:50.44]Play the movie.
[170:53.22]Gas coin is a very intense fight.
[170:57.20]I can't, like, I can't do it.
[171:00.31]But thank you, Sarcasm.
[171:01.27]Thank you, Will.
[171:02.25]And Suicidal Spree with the 500 as well.
[171:06.49]Streamer promises to do 24-hour stream.
[171:08.43]Fans anger that Comcast sucks and the stream crashed.
[171:11.93]Turbine985 is currently on a murderous rampage in Bloodborne to release his frustration.
[171:18.19]That actually sounds pretty accurate.
[171:20.09]That sounds pretty accurate, man.
[171:24.90]I mean, I'll fight Gasco into another song.
[171:28.04]But I'm not gonna open... No.
[171:29.62]I can't do that.
[171:31.86]There's a lot of dodging and I need to time the parries and shit.
[171:35.44]Come on, throw it down here.
[171:36.42]What the fuck, dude?
[171:38.36]Am I not close enough to have him?
[171:39.62]Yeah, there it is.
[171:40.64]I don't think you can get any money.
[171:52.05]Alright.
[171:54.59]Play Sweet Tea.
[171:57.03]Alright, you give me a link to Sweet Tea.
[171:59.81]Oh, no, no.
[172:00.48]Happy Stride.
[172:01.06]There we go.
[172:01.62]That's a good one.
[172:05.23]Alright, this one's only a minute and 38, so I have to beat him in a minute and 38.
[172:08.83]That's not going to happen.
[172:10.03]No way.
[172:18.67]Asset base for every boss fight.
[172:21.67]No.
[172:29.04]This is gonna make me laugh.
[172:30.68]And I'm gonna die.
[172:31.76]And then I'm just gonna, like, go to bed.
[172:33.97]At, like, 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[172:46.15]Solo you out!
[172:53.36]No, I got them both!
[172:57.34]I will get, like, comboed here.
[173:02.52]What?
[173:03.06]What?
[173:03.66]What?
[173:04.18]What?
[173:04.76]What?
[173:07.60]Hey, there's a shard.
[173:08.82]I could go level this up right now.
[173:11.21]It's probably a smart idea to do that.
[173:13.93]That's probably smart, but you know what?
[173:15.51]We're not smart.
[173:17.91]Oh.
[173:20.10]Gascoigne.
[173:20.95]This is Father Gascoigne.
[173:22.01]If you've never seen this game or played it before.
[173:23.62]And I'm not going to play the music until after the cutscene.
[173:25.90]Because the cutscene is cool.
[173:58.12]Beasts all over the shop.
[174:01.31]You will be one of them.
[174:02.89]Sooner or later.
[174:09.67]Not the gas coin!
[174:37.32]Where am I?
[174:39.60]What am I stuck in?
[175:06.72]Okay That was I'm surprised.
[175:14.31]I stayed alive as long as I did I Was just wedged in that that tiny little fucking corner.
[175:21.21]I
[175:27.90]Well, I like parried him like three times.
[175:31.14]That was just stupid.
[175:34.06]I should not have gotten stuck there.
[175:39.52]A little wedge in the wall.
[175:41.18]Are you shitting me right now?
[175:42.38]Give me a break.
[175:50.09]Because you can get stuck between like gravestones, I guess.
[175:52.23]That's why he's annoying.
[175:54.29]But...
[175:56.53]I guess there's like one of those developer walls right there.
[175:59.88]Somehow.
[176:02.42]Uh, I want to level this thing up anyways, so.
[176:08.10]I can sell.
[176:08.82]Oh, fuck this.
[176:09.32]Just sell it.
[176:11.26]And sell.
[176:12.10]Who gives a shit about these?
[176:13.60]Not me right now.
[176:14.49]I want to level that up.
[176:21.81]If that shit don't happen, he dies, man.
[176:27.68]And you all know it.
[176:29.74]Better than Dark Souls.
[176:32.14]I've actually never had that happen to me before.
[176:33.96]Alright, left, whatever.
[176:36.84]I have enough for one bullet.
[176:39.66]Might as well just do it.
[176:44.63]Alright, let's go, Gascoigne.
[176:45.53]This time, don't get me inside of your wall.
[176:55.85]Should go to bed.
[176:56.92]After this, I will.
[176:59.04]I'm going to kill Gascon and then go to sleep.
[177:03.02]Thank you, Crocher, for the five bucks.
[177:04.28]Ragtime saloon piano for all boss fights.
[177:10.16]That was so loud, too.
[177:15.07]I still can't get over that.
[177:19.65]You can't send Jerma your wacky music.
[177:26.19]What am I sick with?
[177:26.71]I just have, like, an annoying face cold, throat hurts, nose hurts, and I'm, like, stuffed up.
[177:34.09]What are those?
[177:35.81]They're not fun.
[177:45.07]Somebody asked earlier, and I want to address it.
[177:48.37]They said, is this game worth getting a PlayStation 4 over?
[177:51.95]Yes.
[177:52.93]Yes.
[177:55.37]Yes, it is.
[177:56.65]If you buy... If you get a Bloodborne machine... That's what it is for you.
[178:03.32]It's absolutely worth it.
[178:07.40]This is by far one of the most interesting, most fun games I've played in like 10 years.
[178:15.94]Oh, I'm a bad... I'm an idiot.
[178:17.12]I didn't pull the lever.
[178:17.80]I didn't step on it.
[178:20.57]It is exclusive PS4 only, unfortunately.
[178:23.53]Not even close.
[178:24.23]What?! !
[178:35.62]Come on, guys.
[178:36.34]You don't... I like Bloodborne not worth PS4's price.
[178:40.73]Isn't the regular PS4 only, like, $190 or something?
[178:45.37]Wasn't it, like, on Black Friday?
[178:47.63]Like, less than $200 or something?
[178:52.33]Plus, I mean, PS4... Doesn't PS4 have, like, obviously Final Fantasy XV?
[178:56.14]Come on, do it.
[178:57.68]Do it.
[178:58.62]I'm waiting.
[178:59.26]Thank you.
[179:05.91]uh you got like death stranding and there's a lot of ps4 exclusives there's not very many xboxes I was like having this conversation the other day about how Xbox One versus ps4 at the moment nothing exclusive has come out for Xbox One that's like worth playing unless you're talking about like halo
[179:29.78]I have both.
[179:30.42]I have a PS4 and... Jesus, buddy.
[179:32.93]Slow down.
[179:33.35]Come on.
[179:34.19]I can't... I forgot.
[179:35.51]I forgot.
[179:36.45]You can't visceral attack them on stairs.
[179:39.25]It's very important.
[179:45.77]But there's a lot of PS4 exclusives that have come out.
[179:48.13]And that are coming out.
[179:50.43]Xbox One doesn't have...
[179:53.59]Nothing really that I cared about.
[179:55.77]Alright, let's go.
[179:57.18]No music, no music.
[179:58.88]Let's just kill Gascoigne.
[180:11.01]I don't like exclusive either, but... They serve a really annoying purpose.
[180:22.45]I'm going to heal after this.
[180:31.68]Because out comes the two-hander.
[180:33.82]He's using the weapon I want to use.
[180:43.75]He's stuck in a wall now.
[181:06.31]Shit!
[181:07.71]Wow!
[181:11.23]Come on, fuck you.
[181:42.09]Here we go.
[182:29.73]Woof!
[182:35.53]Wow, that kick!
[182:37.59]Fuck!
[182:38.71]That fucking kick!
[182:40.47]I just blew it.
[182:43.29]I usually parry him, but fuck me.
[182:45.01]I just got too cocky.
[182:50.94]Ah, I just wasn't parrying him.
[182:52.28]I was just too locked in.
[182:53.48]Fuck me.
[182:54.04]That was stupid.
[182:59.46]I got too defensive.
[183:00.30]Yeah.
[183:04.25]I'm screwed now.
[183:07.41]Time to go to bed.
[183:08.09]Yeah, I'm going to blame that on not being able to hear, but I could use every excuse in the book.
[183:17.12]I just wasn't parrying him and I was just too scared and too cocky about dodging.
[183:21.23]I beat this kid six times.
[183:30.01]Like a year ago.
[183:30.77]Wait, what?
[183:44.51]Can I get more blood?
[183:45.87]I need more stuff.
[183:48.25]It's my first time playing the game.
[183:50.31]Oh, that was too bad.
[183:51.25]If I didn't get kicked.
[183:53.17]If it was that stupid bullshit kick that fucked it all up, I would've been fine.
[184:07.07]Use the Happy Meal shotgun.
[184:19.15]Is my character a man or what are my characters a man?
[184:27.57]I got kicked out of Peggle too.
[184:29.38]Too many kicks.
[184:45.39]Are you allowed to play sorcery on stream?
[184:49.74]Why wouldn't you?
[184:50.42]What do you mean?
[184:52.07]Like, play sorcery?
[185:00.21]I need, uh... Can't do it on the stairs.
[185:04.43]Don't do it on the stairs.
[185:05.15]Do it over here.
[185:08.87]The blunderbuss is too slow.
[185:11.13]Yeah, I don't know why I picked the blunderbuss.
[185:14.49]It has more parry frames, but it is, like, painful.
[185:18.84]I don't have any shots.
[185:20.50]Great.
[185:24.50]That's not good.
[185:30.46]Come on, boys.
[185:33.69]No, uh, do I really have to do this?
[185:35.77]I think I might have to do this.
[185:37.27]I don't want to, but I think I have to.
[185:45.55]I think I'm just getting too tired.
[185:47.51]Oh!
[185:49.31]I'm going to bed.
[185:51.57]I can't hear.
[185:52.27]I can't breathe.
[185:53.01]It's not going to happen right now.
[186:00.08]It's over.
[186:03.84]If you hit up on the D-pad, you get blood bullets.
[186:13.01]Which takes some health.
[186:14.11]Well, I'll show you what it does.
[186:19.15]You get like 30 HP.
[186:21.70]30% HP gets removed.
[186:23.34]But you gain 5 shots.
[186:24.66]As you can see here.
[186:30.30]You can do it as many times as you want, but you can only have 5 at a time.
[186:32.46]But yeah, I...
[186:37.65]Yeah, I need to, you know what I need to do?
[186:38.93]I need to go into like the shower and just blow my fucking nose and then my ears maybe will pop and it'll feel better.
[186:44.86]Because right now it's like I'm underwater right now.
[186:50.16]There's two hands covering my ears.
[186:53.42]But it's all good.
[186:55.04]Bloodborne is fucking fantastic, by the way.
[186:56.90]Like it's one of my favorite fucking games ever made.
[186:58.90]So if you have a PS4 and you don't have it and you like games that kick your ass, I highly recommend it for sure.
[187:08.53]But this weekend I'm gonna make sure I get some streams in here.
[187:13.81]I'm gonna stream on Sunday to make up for a no stream yesterday.
[187:20.76]But it was fun.
[187:21.22]I'm glad even though Hitman kinda shit the bed.
[187:25.12]I'm glad I could at least show you guys Bloodborne.
[187:26.94]Even though I died at Gascoigne when I should have killed him.
[187:30.56]Which is bad.
[187:33.80]Underwater streamer.
[187:37.49]That was very unexpected hilarity that I was not ready for.
[187:39.05]That was the reason why I got worse.
[187:39.89]My sickness increased by 400% after that.
[187:42.05]But it was worth it, for sure.
[187:43.15]But thanks a lot, Will.
[187:43.83]Very generous of you.
[188:06.46]Also, thanks to Neela.
[188:08.04]Thanks to the bits Neela obey the kitten with 250 the music makes the game so much more intense Ragtime yeah, I didn't have the piano on last time.
[188:16.32]That's what happened Blame the ape movie But yeah, thanks a lot guys wolfie.
[188:26.58]Thanks for two months master your dragon nipple
[188:30.36]Thanks for your new subs.
[188:32.50]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[188:34.44]Probably at a similar time, because I'm probably going to be getting over being sick.
[188:41.43]Hopefully.
[188:41.87]I hope this is not one of those stupid situations where you have, like, a cold for, like, seven or eight straight days.
[188:48.61]That's so annoying.
[188:49.43]I hate when that happens.
[188:52.59]But, thanks for sticking around.
[188:54.74]Maybe if I can get Hitman to work on Sunday, I'll play Hitman.
[188:58.70]If not, we'll find something else to do.
[189:00.54]Probably Dara... Demon... Not Demon's Souls.
[189:03.02]God, see, this was... I can't even think.
[189:05.46]Dead Rising.
[189:06.72]I might start Dead Rising 4 on Sunday.
[189:09.78]And, with that, we are going to... Good night.
[189:17.99]Good luck, guys.
[189:19.03]Have a good rest of your night.
[189:20.87]See you guys all soon.
[189:21.98]Goodbye.
