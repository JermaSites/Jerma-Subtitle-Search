[00:00.47]Oh, I'm gonna read this one.
[00:01.79]Viva Pinata ran its course.
[00:04.45]ResidentSleeper Drew Crew is out in full force.
[00:08.38]Oh.
[00:10.60]So we didn't run Drew Crew's course with, like, five streams and, like, 17 hours of gameplay?
[00:18.67]I think you're holding on to something there.
[00:28.84]Three and a half hours of Viva Pinata.
[00:34.54]Do you guys act like I've streamed this game for the last, like, four years straight?
[00:42.10]Holy shit, Viva Pinata!
[00:44.60]It's been 75 hours of this game straight!
[00:50.18]I played it yesterday for, like, three hours.
[00:56.75]I need to check on my animals.
[01:02.36]And that's what we're gonna do.
[01:14.05]Check on your Animal Crossing village?
[01:15.77]I can't!
[01:18.33]It's not here!
[01:19.25]I got- My girlfriend needs something- I gotta have something to do!
[01:29.68]She's playing Animal Crossing.
[01:31.22]I'm playing my version of Animal Crossing, which is animal related.
[01:36.19]And it's called Viva Pi√±ata Out of Control.
[01:39.25]What was the name of the game?
[01:46.18]Trouble in Paradise.
[01:47.02]That's the one.
[01:58.54]It's the Animal Crossing Wannabe.
[02:00.21]They both came out at the same time!
[02:01.65]I'm opening it up!
[02:02.63]Wait, go on.
[02:06.55]This is what I want to play, and this is what we're gonna play.
[02:10.15]Where's my headphones?
[02:12.61]What?
[02:15.91]What the fuck happened?
[02:16.71]Where are my headphones?
[02:21.80]Why am... Why are my headphones not in this room?
[02:24.26]Wait, they were connected yesterday!
[02:25.84]What?
[02:29.80]Hold on a second.
[02:30.30]Why are my headphones not here?
[02:36.75]What the fuck?
[02:38.57]I didn't take them out of here.
[02:39.53]This doesn't make any sense.
[02:44.69]Clear.
[02:44.87]I got them.
[02:48.61]I got them.
[02:49.01]They were wrapped up in the bottom of the chair.
[02:50.71]Okay, we're good.
[02:52.81]No, it wasn't Kim.
[02:54.43]It wasn't Kim.
[02:55.07]Alright, I got them.
[02:57.61]We're good.
[03:02.42]Imagine that.
[03:06.57]Alright, here we go.
[03:08.75]Can we just get bits?
[03:09.67]We did.
[03:14.75]Uh, we did.
[03:15.29]Right now.
[03:15.90]Very nice!
[03:18.56]Gave 20 dollars in bits.
[03:20.88]Can you guys even hear this?
[03:27.04]Yeah, you can, okay.
[03:28.33]20 bucks if it's 2,000.
[03:30.35]Love you, Jerma.
[03:30.91]Always stay safe, bro.
[03:32.79]That's been very nice.
[03:34.69]Well, I think that's very nice, so... Thank you.
[03:39.27]Don't mind me just passing through.
[03:40.85]Alright, what were we doing?
[03:47.24]I wanted to get... Okay, here we go.
[03:52.30]Aw, yes.
[03:52.94]There they are.
[03:53.58]It's been so long since I've seen you two.
[03:57.84]Wouldn't they just drown?
[04:04.56]Wouldn't that frog be, like, swallowing water?
[04:09.99]Wake them up.
[04:12.05]Alright, so let me, let me, okay, right, right, right, this is what I was gonna do.
[04:21.27]I got a plan.
[04:26.18]We're gonna get cats.
[04:27.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:30.66]Cats eat mice.
[04:32.26]Mice have sex.
[04:33.78]Mice make more mice.
[04:35.66]Feed cats.
[04:37.20]Cats have sex.
[04:39.18]What do cats need?
[04:42.14]We'll find out maybe eventually here.
[04:43.36]Okay.
[04:46.41]Give me my shovel.
[04:48.41]I need crabs, too.
[04:50.21]Wait!
[04:51.93]Alright, send that person off in a cannon.
[04:55.71]I'll level up if I do this, right?
[04:56.99]Yeah!
[04:58.09]Anyways, I didn't do an intro.
[04:59.50]Hey guys, welcome to the stream.
[05:01.52]Fucking cool!
[05:08.78]What's that?
[05:09.10]What's the cannon box?
[05:10.92]There it is.
[05:19.77]That was lame.
[05:20.45]Do it again.
[05:20.93]No, I already did my intro.
[05:26.07]This isn't like 2012.
[05:26.79]I don't need to be like, hey, what's going on, everybody?
[05:31.71]It's Jerma here with another stream.
[05:36.05]No, this is 2020.
[05:36.62]That was better.
[05:44.58]He's unprofessional.
[05:59.84]Gameplay.
[06:03.16]Wait, how come it's not shooting at all?
[06:07.05]How many do I need to pack in here?
[06:09.49]Did I not pack it?
[06:15.77]I did, so why is the cannon not shooting?
[06:20.05]Like my post if you're here from the Discord.
[06:21.95]I got it.
[06:22.24]I am
[06:24.72]That has to be a new... Oh.
[06:26.32]So did I just remove that person for no reason?
[06:27.84]Kind of annoying.
[06:29.28]Alright, what's most, uh, what do I want?
[06:34.89]Like my post if you're here from the Discord.
[06:36.99]Alright, what do you think?
[06:44.69]I'm thinking sand.
[06:45.67]I'm thinking sand over this way.
[06:50.08]Yep.
[06:50.94]That looks good to me.
[06:54.21]I don't want that much sand, though, because don't the snakes not like sand?
[06:57.07]Fix the noise gate on your microphone.
[07:01.25]Don't worry.
[07:02.37]In, like, in a week, I won't even be in the same place.
[07:07.77]We'll fix that some other time.
[07:10.11]Why, does it sound fucked up?
[07:14.18]I mean, it seems like it's working.
[07:22.05]What's wrong with it?
[07:35.46]Yeah, it's working.
[07:39.10]It's working.
[07:41.64]It's fine.
[07:45.65]Do a stream from the back of the moving van?
[07:49.50]Like, I'm just sitting back there.
[07:51.82]Just like... Sitting at a desk, trying to, like, stream something.
[07:57.53]Now, what happened to my... Why doesn't my right analog not work now?
[08:07.14]What the fuck?
[08:10.14]Why can I not... Up and down on my analog doesn't do anything.
[08:12.28]Uh...
[08:19.38]Okay.
[08:20.74]What the hell is going on?
[08:27.64]Uh... What's that?
[08:33.74]What's that mean?
[08:41.31]What's that?
[08:41.81]What's that mean?
[08:43.61]Battery?
[08:44.01]Well, why can't I go forward and why can't... Wait, there's no battery going to the right analog?! !
[08:51.78]Battery going to X!
[09:01.37]What?!
[09:01.77]Hold on, I do I... He's orange!
[09:09.43]Stop!
[09:16.05]I just wanna play with my animals!
[09:20.10]Why does the right analog not fucking work?
[09:23.04]What does this take for batteries?
[09:26.39]Two double A?
[09:27.69]Got it, right here.
[09:29.15]Oh, right!
[09:29.63]Okay.
[09:36.85]Oh!
[09:37.55]Surgery.
[09:39.43]Surgery on stream.
[09:40.63]I didn't even sedate this guy.
[09:41.87]I didn't even, I didn't, he didn't even get anesthesia.
[09:49.49]Sorry.
[09:52.96]Which way does it go?
[09:53.48]Which way does it go?
[09:58.87]Wait, you can't take that serial number and, like, fucking, like, do anything to me, right?
[10:10.43]Alright, let's, where's, uh... How does it go?
[10:14.31]Wait, oh, fuck!
[10:17.63]God damn it, they're all the same brand!
[10:20.60]And I just dropped them!
[10:22.71]I think, wait, I don't remember.
[10:23.83]I think this is it.
[10:32.42]My brand.
[10:34.92]Why are you orange?
[10:37.58]Because this fucking white palette isn't set up right now.
[10:40.14]I don't know.
[10:50.83]What?
[10:54.26]Okay, L, the triggers don't work.
[10:58.67]The bumpers work.
[11:01.11]B doesn't work.
[11:04.55]What's going on?
[11:07.11]Those are the right batteries.
[11:09.16]Okay, up and down works.
[11:11.04]Start works.
[11:13.84]B does work.
[11:14.76]So why does the right analog not work?
[11:16.64]The triggers don't work either.
[11:23.12]Hold on, I gotta, I gotta like restart the fucking game?
[11:28.72]Smash the controller in the closet.
[11:30.78]No, no, no.
[11:32.23]Let me, hold on.
[11:33.49]This doesn't make any sense.
[11:38.33]Controller style?
[11:42.94]What?
[11:45.60]What?! !
[12:15.24]Why would they do that?
[12:17.02]Why would that even be an option?
[12:21.00]Simple controls.
[12:22.08]Well, all simple controls does is just remove the function of half of your controller.
[12:28.69]Alright, okay, let's go.
[12:38.71]Okay, I want to do more, I want to do more grass over here.
[12:48.56]Dude, that's like all dirt over here.
[12:54.92]Get the crab?
[12:55.72]I'm gonna.
[12:56.76]I'm gonna.
[12:57.44]I'm trying.
[12:57.96]I'm just trying to make this look a little better.
[12:59.34]I just got an expanded... I got an expanded ground.
[13:12.41]Cheeto puff controller?
[13:13.93]Let's do... yeah, over to here.
[13:17.66]Get rid of this... yeah, that's like a little beach.
[13:19.22]That's fine.
[13:20.32]The snakes don't like this, though.
[13:21.54]I'm gonna... let me change this.
[13:35.15]Turn the orange cam back on.
[13:41.17]Fine.
[13:43.97]No, I don't like this, because you can see my fucking red eyes from, like, sleeping two hours a night.
[13:51.22]No, I don't like that.
[13:51.96]You guys can see my fucking, like, two hours of sleep eyes.
[14:02.23]You should wink.
[14:03.07]I'm not fucking winking.
[14:04.47]He's high.
[14:12.62]Please.
[14:14.90]I'm trying to make this place look better.
[14:18.32]What shit are you wearing?
[14:19.70]What shit?
[14:23.32]It's a Pac-Man t-shirt.
[14:24.84]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[14:30.33]Look at how messed up this is.
[14:33.67]It doesn't matter.
[14:34.53]I'll fix it.
[14:35.11]I just don't want this to look so shitty.
[14:39.17]This looks awful Look at how much cleaner this is gonna start to look now How's David doing?
[14:56.34]I don't know.
[14:57.80]I don't know who David is Alright, that's better.
[15:01.66]We got a little pond over there now.
[15:04.07]Let's put this way Now I'd like why you what what are you doing?
[15:09.03]What the fuck is she doing?
[15:10.73]It's the guy you stole the Xbox from.
[15:17.61]I didn't steal any Xbox, actually.
[15:19.37]This was... I bought it.
[15:23.19]Alright, now we need a little bit more... We'll do desert over here.
[15:25.66]How do I get you to get in here?
[15:27.66]Just eat one of these mice.
[15:28.50]Hurry up.
[15:28.80]Let's do desert over here.
[15:31.34]No, no, no.
[15:37.94]You bought a stolen Xbox.
[15:47.28]I don't... I don't think that's what happened.
[15:49.08]I think I made that name.
[15:52.94]I don't know why, but maybe... I don't know.
[15:55.22]I did for some reason?
[15:56.66]I can't think of a reason why.
[16:02.68]That's a liar.
[16:05.52]I don't know.
[16:06.04]Maybe I'll check and see what David's, like, play history is.
[16:10.76]Right?
[16:10.98]Alright, that's good.
[16:14.72]Alright, this is a daisy.
[16:19.48]I need some more.
[16:20.22]Look at this.
[16:20.58]This is starting to come together.
[16:21.44]What's in here?
[16:22.82]What the hell is this?
[16:25.10]Oh, shit.
[16:25.32]It's another water tube.
[16:29.99]Wait, what happened to the other water tube?
[16:31.65]Did somebody eat it?
[16:34.97]Who ate it?
[16:35.35]Did somebody eat that old water tube?
[16:39.05]Oh, it's like a little lily pad.
[16:45.15]I did.
[16:45.99]Well, you fucking shouldn't have done that.
[16:53.89]How much water can the watercress take in?
[16:58.15]Too much.
[17:06.80]Okay, so we have to get the... This is good.
[17:09.50]So what does it take for a crab again?
[17:10.76]We need much more water.
[17:12.74]So I'm thinking... So we got a little sand portion over there.
[17:16.02]We need more sand.
[17:16.88]I'm thinking another sand portion this way.
[17:19.20]Right?
[17:19.48]Because this is where we could bring the crabs in over here.
[17:21.48]That's what I'm thinking.
[17:25.14]You're right.
[17:25.48]I shouldn't have done that.
[17:28.91]The streamer is pissed.
[17:32.07]Why am I pissed?
[17:34.49]Is it because I'm, like, red-
[17:43.13]You know what we're gonna do tomorrow?
[17:47.70]And for the next 30 to 40 straight days.
[17:53.42]This.
[17:59.24]I'm gonna play Viva Pinata every single fucking goddamn day.
[18:07.90]for the rest of my life until I'm 100.
[18:09.23]Because I'm making it to 100, okay?
[18:13.97]You know how many green vegetables I eat on a weekly basis?
[18:20.64]Not enough.
[18:21.82]Probably like one serving a week, which is bad.
[18:24.16]You should do like a green serving of vegetables every fucking day.
[18:27.44]At least every other day.
[18:29.96]But now that I think about it, I'll probably... Nutritionally speaking, I'll probably make it to like 61.
[18:36.66]That's why I gotta start now.
[18:37.76]I've got to start eating green vegetables on every meal.
[18:42.86]Oh, seeds.
[18:49.26]You gotta start like 20 years ago, dude.
[18:54.11]I actually... I actually eat very well.
[18:57.89]I eat at least one green vegetable at every meal.
[19:03.45]Can I even do this with a straight face?
[19:08.52]Ooh, the trick stick.
[19:09.18]We should try that.
[19:11.68]Tahini.
[19:12.20]I have tahini pasted every meal.
[19:13.84]Um... What plant dried out?
[19:20.36]Didn't I just overwater this, like, five fucking seconds ago?
[19:26.61]Another $20 donation just came in.
[19:29.91]From VeryNoise.
[19:30.95]Another one.
[19:31.55]2,000 bits.
[19:32.63]Thanks, dude.
[19:34.43]Thank you for that.
[19:34.93]That's 4,000 bits total in the last, like, 10 minutes.
[19:39.43]Thank you.
[19:41.34]The cheez-its have made him orange.
[19:45.80]Should I fix it?
[19:46.48]You want me to fix it so it's not orange?
[19:50.78]You want me to put, like, a handsome filter on?
[19:55.31]No.
[19:55.95]What?
[19:56.41]Why?
[20:01.47]Put the handsome filter on.
[20:11.22]Hold on.
[20:15.31]Wait, this is wrong.
[20:20.85]What?
[20:21.07]Hold on.
[20:28.14]Something's wrong here.
[20:39.37]I can't get it right.
[20:40.29]It looks wrong like this and it looks wrong like this.
[20:42.33]Okay, here we go.
[20:45.73]Right?
[20:46.65]Yeah.
[20:48.01]Alright, we'll put the handsome filter on here in a second.
[20:53.63]There.
[21:13.44]I could be anything!
[21:15.08]You can imagine the rest of my features!
[21:17.02]See how handsome this is?
[21:37.52]What's going on?
[21:38.02]No, fuck!
[21:43.17]You know what the worst part about this is?
[21:45.85]You know when you're watching a streamer, and they have autofocus on, which, by the way, you want a streamer tip, turn autofocus off.
[21:52.21]Because what happens is it gets like this, and they don't even know it's like that, and the camera is fucking struggling so hard to just please refocus it.
[22:02.28]And it could be like this for about two to three straight minutes.
[22:11.08]But we're going to keep it here for five straight minutes.
[22:14.85]Wait, how else can I change this to make it... How else can I change it to be like, hey streamer, something's wrong with your webcam?
[22:20.99]How about this?
[22:30.14]Alright, this is... This is... I just plugged it in.
[22:36.26]yeah this is I just plugged the webcam in and didn't even do one setting I just turned the stream on after even this is not even default I just plugged it in and turned it on now actually that would be more like this that this is more accurate if you just plugged it in for the first time and didn't even do any settings
[23:05.47]Let's make me a little bit more handsome, though.
[23:18.16]Now this is just the side image for every copypasta villain or monster you've ever read about.
[23:36.47]Yeah, like... Turn the blur off?
[23:49.75]Yeah, it has to be forward and like eyes wide open and mouth wide open.
[23:55.75]We'll get you a better one, hold on.
[24:00.48]Really close too, like... Is somebody dead?
[24:05.97]This is actually scary.
[24:09.63]It's delayed.
[24:10.29]Oh.
[24:18.12]Whoa.
[24:19.74]Look at that guy.
[24:20.58]Kind of looks alright.
[24:47.94]I'm scaring me.
[24:48.64]Alright, get this off.
[24:51.68]Go shave.
[24:53.40]It's a process, okay?
[24:55.29]It's a, you know, you know when Jarvis goes like this and he gets like right into the fucking camera and he goes like.
[25:03.96]Keep the cam on.
[25:04.82]No!
[25:05.30]Alright.
[25:06.48]People, animals are over here.
[25:07.96]What?
[25:08.12]Oh, shit.
[25:08.56]Real face.
[25:09.84]This is what I really look like.
[25:12.23]Come on, man.
[25:12.71]We can't do that.
[25:30.40]There we go.
[25:33.28]This hurts my fucking eyes, I'm done.
[25:43.17]Oh, there he is for real.
[25:44.43]Now let's go the other way.
[25:47.53]Oh!
[25:47.71]This is what I look like!
[25:50.91]Oh shit!
[25:53.25]Oh!
[26:01.08]Fuck!
[26:19.17]Okay
[26:27.69]This sound is freaking me out.
[26:30.59]My skin doesn't look like this.
[26:32.42]What's with my lips?
[26:33.70]Alright, I've just burnt.
[26:35.28]I can only stream for like three or four hours and I've already burnt like, burnt, burnt.
[26:41.10]I've already burnt.
[26:42.24]Stay in, do it right.
[26:43.35]I've already burnt like 30 minutes.
[26:48.35]I just burnt it.
[27:00.44]Nothing's real!
[27:01.42]Nothing is real!
[27:02.56]Nothing is real!
[27:03.26]Alright, what the fuck was I doing?
[27:27.01]Sounds fucking with my head!
[27:28.13]Alright, let's go.
[27:36.37]I need a surfboard in the garden.
[27:37.51]You got it.
[27:45.97]Where do I get it?
[27:47.15]Who sells a surfboard?
[27:49.37]It's de-synced?
[27:50.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[27:52.12]It's not de-synced.
[27:53.42]It's not de-synced.
[27:54.10]What?
[27:54.22]It's not.
[28:03.33]No, it can't be.
[28:04.35]It can't be.
[28:04.81]I refuse to believe them.
[28:05.61]Don't believe them.
[28:06.97]Alright, so we need toys.
[28:08.51]Surfboard, right?
[28:11.47]Toys?
[28:12.77]Woo-woo train?
[28:14.56]Where do I get a surfboard?
[28:19.24]It's code voice.
[28:20.58]It's horribly desynced.
[28:22.32]Okay, I don't believe you.
[28:25.32]The camera is set to be... Hold on.
[28:31.70]Now, the camera is set to be delayed by 650 milliseconds.
[28:35.85]The microphone is 650 milliseconds.
[28:38.67]Ready?
[28:39.95]This is how you know.
[28:42.17]I do know, because they're both set for 650.
[28:44.07]Yes, so now it's 650.
[28:50.64]My mic is 650.
[28:56.50]You're burning time!
[28:58.75]You guys are burning time!
[29:01.24]I've got three hours!
[29:02.28]You're burning time!
[29:06.30]My voice is early.
[29:11.97]My voice happens before the mouth moves.
[29:20.37]Yeah.
[29:21.21]Yeah.
[29:21.85]Yeah.
[29:22.73]Yeah.
[29:23.49]Yep.
[29:24.03]Yep.
[29:25.35]How's that?
[29:32.18]Somebody said fucking go.
[29:37.00]No, they're right.
[29:37.62]They're right.
[29:38.32]Okay.
[29:40.88]I need a surfboard.
[29:41.74]Do I not have access to a surfboard yet or what?
[29:50.22]I don't have a surfboard.
[29:54.89]When do you get a surfboard?
[29:55.85]Anybody know?
[30:00.81]Stop sign?
[30:01.55]It's gonna be in the toys.
[30:02.51]They probably don't have it.
[30:07.15]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[30:09.89]No one plays this game.
[30:11.49]This is such a... People love this game.
[30:13.86]You guys are being mean to this series for no reason.
[30:17.38]This is like a fun game.
[30:19.06]Like the pinata animals.
[30:20.66]Come on, what a fucking idea.
[30:23.06]A new pinata's been spotted in the desert.
[30:24.48]Ooh, let's go.
[30:27.02]He's scared of the duck.
[30:28.14]I don't know.
[30:28.60]I don't have a surfboard.
[30:31.12]Like, pinatas.
[30:32.88]Like, that's so... Look at how cool that is.
[30:44.44]Alright, you gotta explain to me how catching fish in Animal Crossing is pog, but watching frog in lake is un-pog.
[30:59.83]I need an explanation here.
[31:06.35]Neither are pog.
[31:08.94]Neither.
[31:15.08]You tell me that serpent one is un-pog.
[31:19.69]But if I...
[31:24.04]That was pretty un-pog.
[31:25.24]Okay.
[31:25.34]So, let's go over this again.
[31:26.76]So this is un-pog, but if I took the head off this snake and put it on a standing body, gave him a shovel, and had him go like this.
[31:32.44]That would be pog.
[31:59.51]I just want to make sure I get the facts correct with my brain.
[32:02.49]Yes.
[32:07.37]Yo, that's fog!
[32:10.85]Why does this guy hate Animal Crossing?
[32:13.19]I love Animal Crossing!
[32:16.16]But I don't, I don't, I refuse to believe that this is an Unpog moment right here.
[32:25.44]That was not a good example.
[32:54.56]both and they both are fun and I can't wait for Viva Pinata 3 on the road again coming soon for the Xbox Scorpion I'll be the guy that plays it alright what does this person want alright you guys I know what you're doing so fucking tactful
[33:24.69]You're distracting me.
[33:25.71]You're derailing things so we can... You're burning time.
[33:29.84]Fucking smart.
[33:32.30]Real smart.
[33:32.86]That's a pretty good idea.
[33:38.72]And I get it now.
[33:43.95]I'm very easy to... I'm very manipulatable, apparently.
[33:49.39]It's still working.
[34:00.51]Alright, I'm gonna go back to what I was doing in my pog experience.
[34:09.56]Oh, digging holes in this game sucks, but if you dig a hole in Animal Crossing... I can't even put it there.
[34:32.83]I want to put two images side by side.
[34:35.01]I want to put this with ResidentSleepers, and then I want to put the Animal Crossing dig with like a bunch of pogs.
[34:42.09]Somebody get on it.
[34:45.01]Somebody get on it.
[34:45.59]Oh, this has to be desert, desert, desert, desert, desert.
[34:52.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:56.23]That's a terrible meme.
[34:57.90]I'm not making a meme.
[34:58.82]That's from my personal collection.
[35:02.02]I'm gonna have that playing on a Roku stick behind me in a frame for the next six weeks.
[35:23.31]Where does this go?
[35:24.77]What the fuck is this thing?
[35:27.11]Does this go in the desert?
[35:30.02]What's- this is not the right- as if- as if to go on soil.
[35:34.65]Oh, fuck.
[35:39.97]Dreamer sucks at this game.
[35:45.70]It's a Reddit joke.
[35:48.94]I have a feeling that all the people that talk all this shit about Reddit have like a post history that's like 30 pages long.
[35:58.63]Fuckin' Redditor.
[36:00.13]I can't believe he uses Reddit.
[36:02.90]And if you go to the, like, u slash fuckin' whatever the name is.
[36:10.08]There it is.
[36:10.86]Like, ten pages.
[36:12.75]Like, r slash Smash Brothers.
[36:14.53]They've been on, they have, like, 600 posts.
[36:17.01]And they're all at least a paragraph each.
[36:26.75]That's un-pog.
[36:27.69]Alright, I gotta go back to the desert.
[36:29.45]I wanna find the new... The Bork, you're doing a good job.
[36:33.01]Look at you guys.
[36:33.63]Look at you go.
[36:38.87]Look at you go.
[36:39.85]Uh, no.
[36:41.61]I don't wanna go to the Arctic.
[36:49.11]I want a gecko.
[36:51.15]Yes, I do.
[36:53.01]I don't think I've been here at night.
[36:57.89]Irma actually made me have fun.
[36:59.63]How does he do it?
[37:03.55]What do you mean I made you?
[37:04.80]What?
[37:07.34]We're just hanging out here, man.
[37:08.76]We're just having fun, man.
[37:18.65]You're forcing fun.
[37:22.66]What did you guys think I have some like fucking streamer playbook on how to like... We're having fun in a jail cell.
[37:37.66]I've never heard of a java prison system where the doors are all unlocked and you can leave the prison at any time.
[37:49.13]Yeah, sir, you're sentenced for 20 years in prison.
[37:51.97]By the way, uh, the doors are all open and you can just, you can leave whenever you want, sir.
[37:57.69]This is, what do you mean, prison?
[37:59.97]You can just walk out of your cell, walk out the door, and go to the nearest Wendy's and go, what are fucking number four?
[38:04.82]What are you guys doing?
[38:46.93]I love the 4% battery.
[38:48.67]Alright, I need to lock this fucking thing in place.
[39:03.86]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[39:07.60]Would you... Would you swipe left on this person?
[39:12.14]Wait, is it right?
[39:13.40]Would you swipe... Alright, would you swipe right on this?
[39:22.56]Yeah.
[39:25.82]I think this is one of those cases where you go, ooh.
[39:29.62]I mean, it's alright, but you got any, like, other pictures?
[39:34.56]And then the next four pictures are me, like, with my face blocked out like this.
[39:40.33]And this is another person, and this is another person.
[39:43.13]And I'm, like, I'm, like, peeking through like this.
[39:46.13]This is where they are.
[39:47.31]It's like this.
[39:59.73]I'd fucking... I'd... I'd swipe right on that person.
[40:04.60]Because that person's me.
[40:05.92]If I was on Tinder, I'd be like, oh, yeah.
[40:08.20]That guy looks alright.
[40:09.62]I'd fucking hang out with that guy.
[40:14.30]Gecko alert!
[40:15.27]Gecko alert!
[40:23.17]You're an egomaniac.
[40:26.31]Set off early and catch some good stuff.
[40:28.80]I like your style.
[40:30.40]of the smartest people ever were in the most successful the coolest people ever were egomaniacs like um
[41:04.57]Who's like an egomaniac that was really successful that now everyone doesn't look back and go, oh, that person sucked?
[41:12.42]Is that gonna happen to me?
[41:16.90]In like 40 years, are you guys gonna be like in your 40s and 50s and look back and be like, oh, wow, that guy sucked?
[41:26.78]Shit.
[41:28.04]Alright, we're gonna dial it back.
[41:31.12]I'm like a... Look, here's the safe way to answer any of these questions.
[41:35.48]Oh, what?
[41:36.38]How good looking do you think you are?
[41:37.59]I'm like a 7.
[41:39.43]I'm a 7, I think.
[41:41.31]And then people are like, okay, that's not too high, but that's not too low.
[41:43.73]You got, like, some confidence.
[41:45.17]Alright, I'm a 7.
[41:45.77]Just say 7 for everything.
[41:49.43]Oh, I just, I just, that was a home cooked meal.
[41:50.99]I just cooked it for you.
[41:51.77]And I, what did you think?
[41:53.11]If you didn't like it, that was like, that was seven.
[41:56.41]I was into it.
[41:56.89]75.
[41:58.81]Sounds pretty good.
[42:02.19]Or if you are reviewing, if you're reviewing any movie, TV show, video game, or book, just do that too.
[42:09.52]It works everywhere.
[42:10.10]75 is terrible.
[42:22.16]75 is not terrible.
[42:25.64]75 is... I thought this was terrible, but I didn't want to tell you that it was terrible.
[42:33.25]Fuck!
[42:34.03]Don't listen to that.
[42:34.95]I've done this like 10 times already on this stream.
[42:37.97]Uh-oh.
[42:39.89]No, now everyone's gonna go back and look for all the sevens I gave the games.
[42:44.59]Oh, shit.
[42:49.89]Uh, what have I done that to recently?
[42:55.11]He gave a 7 to Outer Wilds.
[42:57.72]I did not.
[42:58.28]No, I did not.
[42:58.78]I gave that an 89.
[42:59.76]Get out of here.
[43:01.70]I did not give Animal Crossing a 7.
[43:03.06]I did not.
[43:04.68]Outer Wilds was an 89.
[43:09.22]He hates Mario Sunshine.
[43:10.51]I didn't even score Mario Sunshine.
[43:13.63]What are you talking about?
[43:14.57]He gave a 7 to that Ninja game.
[43:23.68]Oh, okay.
[43:24.18]This is the image I was looking for.
[43:29.07]Rate Animal Crossing.
[43:39.29]No.
[43:40.15]I can't.
[43:42.25]Because if I give Animal Crossing a score, it's either too low throw rocks at his house, or it's too high.
[43:48.28]That game is boring.
[43:49.18]What an idiot.
[43:52.90]I don't think I can take a position on there.
[44:03.82]Get the rocks!
[44:04.78]They're in my eye.
[44:10.02]I'm having fun!
[44:13.25]It doesn't matter!
[44:13.83]It could be anything in the fucking screen right now.
[44:16.05]Alright, what was it?
[44:18.89]Here.
[44:38.04]I like Animal Crossing.
[44:39.72]This is, this is just a little like, this is just a little shtick, you know what I mean?
[44:43.46]But it's, I like, I really like, I really like Animal Crossing.
[44:50.41]No one, wait.
[44:52.27]Why, why is there, why is there, why is there dialog in the left one?
[44:57.90]Why is there dialog in the left one?
[45:01.92]Who's Lily?
[45:03.88]Lily, League of Legends team?
[45:05.82]What the fuck did you get this from?
[45:10.62]Isn't there a League of Legends team?
[45:18.39]Where did you get this fucking image from?
[45:20.35]Alright, anyways...
[45:26.75]What was I just saying?
[45:28.31]It's a random screen cap.
[45:30.91]Oh yeah, I need a trap.
[45:32.27]Business Edition.
[45:34.85]That's unnecessary.
[45:38.79]You are a boomer.
[45:41.80]Alright.
[45:43.10]What do you want me to say?
[45:45.38]Yes, I am.
[45:47.46]Yes, I am.
[45:50.14]I'm a boomer.
[45:51.90]How do I respond to that?
[45:54.30]What's the proper way to respond to somebody saying that now?
[45:59.88]Alright, now I need a... What do they... They want a snow thing?
[46:08.49]They know.
[46:09.03]I don't even know... I'm... That's the thing.
[46:13.61]I'm not even.
[46:17.93]Alright, come on.
[46:18.75]No snake.
[46:19.75]You go get this.
[46:22.03]I want... Look at... Look at that.
[46:23.00]Look at that.
[46:23.30]Look at that.
[46:23.60]Look at that.
[46:23.92]Look at that.
[46:24.24]Look at that.
[46:24.56]Look at that.
[46:25.16]Look at that.
[46:25.50]Yep.
[46:25.84]Look at that.
[46:26.16]Yep.
[46:26.46]Look at that.
[46:27.40]Got it.
[46:48.69]ResidentSleeper, ResidentSleeper, ResidentSleeper, ResidentSleeper.
[46:53.34]You know, I'm going to record something right now, and when I see them, I'm just going to... Hold on.
[47:07.90]Yeah, let's go back.
[47:16.11]Well, there's a cooldown on it.
[47:17.81]I know you guys are just doing it for fun now.
[47:24.42]Alright, where's my... Let's go get it.
[47:27.10]I finally am going to get a gecko.
[47:31.45]We're not.
[47:31.93]This is boring.
[47:34.69]I'll press it right now.
[47:36.67]And it'll, you'll be, wait, this is not even centered.
[47:39.62]This looks fucked up.
[47:42.96]What did you guys do?
[47:45.60]Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, what the fuck did you just do?
[47:51.94]What did, what did you do?
[47:53.86]What did you do?
[48:05.23]I'm sorry.
[48:13.46]Alright, here we go.
[48:15.06]You don't like the frogs.
[48:18.08]Frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:20.12]There's a frog at the bottom.
[48:22.12]There's a leg in the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:24.96]There's a leg in the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:27.38]There's a sea, there's a sea, there's a hole in the bottom of the sea.
[48:29.72]There's a ward in the, ward in the leg in the frog, ward in the leg in the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:36.19]There's a ward in the leg in the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:39.55]There's a hole at the bottom of the sea.
[48:42.81]There's a fly on the bottom of the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:48.12]There's a fly on the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[48:53.77]There's something down there at the bottom of the sea.
[48:56.71]There's a hair on the fly in the water, the frog... There's a... There's a hair... There's a hair on the fly in the... There's a hair on the fly in the water, the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea.
[49:10.92]There's a hair on the fly in the water, the frog in the log... Fuck!
[49:19.29]You guys didn't go to preschool?
[49:20.91]How many... Wait, you guys... Ow!
[49:36.14]Look what you made me do.
[49:36.90]I'm not American.
[49:37.24]What you guys didn't have?
[49:38.82]Like, there's this, and then this, and then this, and then this, and then this or that.
[49:45.00]And then everyone's like laughing and it's fun and everybody's like moving around and cheering and stuff.

[51:23.39]Shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[51:25.47]But this one's good too.
[51:32.68]This one's also good.

[52:02.80]I want... Where's the gecko?
[52:03.96]Did you guys make me lose my gecko?
[52:07.48]I think you actually made me lose the gecko.
[52:10.17]I think he left.
[52:12.33]You gotta be kidding me.
[52:13.11]I can't believe it.
[52:15.93]I can't believe it.
[52:18.19]Gecko's gone.
[52:25.49]Play... Play Tokyo.
[52:26.87]No.
[52:28.37]I'm gonna play Ikaruga.
[52:33.50]Hold on.
[52:44.92]I'll play Ikaruga tomorrow.
[52:49.71]Can beat that game in like two or three hours.
[52:56.97]You guys don't think I'll be able to do Ikaruga?
[52:58.55]Oh, you've got something.
[53:00.35]You'll see.
[53:08.29]You should play... That's a guaranteed no.
[53:12.43]You don't have to beat every game in one stream.
[53:18.16]I mean, Ikaruga's only... I looked up time to beat, and it said an hour and a half.
[53:23.40]So I think I could do it.
[53:27.55]Remember, this is important.
[53:28.29]Please, can you pretty please get me a kitty?
[53:30.47]Yeah, sure.
[53:32.05]The cat doesn't want to come over here.
[53:32.99]There's plenty of food over here.
[53:36.67]Alright, now...
[53:38.69]Where are the ducks?
[53:39.87]Ducks need to eat crabs.
[53:40.87]I need a taffy.
[53:45.11]Sergeant Boomer.
[53:46.13]Sorry about that.
[53:46.81]I played Resonate before, goddammit.
[54:09.15]Is this... Is this just shout games that you like... hour?
[54:20.16]Is this just yell games that you like... hour?
[54:23.06]Play Gex?
[54:23.42]Oh shit!
[54:35.89]I have a 3DO.
[54:37.13]I have like 15 3DO games and I have a 3DO.
[54:43.20]I was supposed to do that very recently.
[54:45.62]I was supposed to play 3DO.
[54:49.24]But for some reason I did not do it.
[54:51.18]I said I was going to do it like next week, but I didn't do it though.
[54:54.84]Weird that I... Weird that I... Weird... Kind of weird that I...
[55:06.51]Kind of weird that I... Kind of weird that I... Kind of weird that I... Okay.
[55:11.88]Something fucking happened there.
[55:13.64]I think I messed up.
[55:15.90]Kind of weird that I bring that up.
[55:21.51]Because I was supposed to play Gex like three weeks ago.
[55:26.83]Real voice revealed?
[55:28.05]Fuck you, go on about it.
[55:37.79]This game's boring.
[55:38.49]Play Fortnite.
[55:43.40]I'm never going to open Fortnite on this stream.
[55:45.95]Ever.
[55:47.71]Ever.
[55:49.81]I will never open that video game on this stream.
[55:52.30]I got real close.
[55:56.89]Those of you that know what the Fortnite stream was going to be, it's the only time I was going to open it.
[55:59.77]That was going to be the vape pen stream.
[56:02.75]Remember?
[56:04.23]I was going to be in like stunner shades and like really bright colors and just smash on a fucking vape pen.
[56:14.89]And I was going to have, over the course of like an hour of playing it, I was going to fill this room.
[56:18.82]I was going to have, well not this one, but I was going to do something where I was safe to do it.
[56:22.94]And have fog machines just fill the fucking room with just vapor.
[56:27.80]And I'm just gonna sit in there until I disappeared completely.
[56:30.64]And it was gonna be like a... And I was gonna still just be fucking doing it and still talking and like just like going for like fucking headshot.
[56:50.42]That stream is gonna be like 40 minutes long.
[56:54.85]But I didn't because that means I'd have to open Fortnite.
[56:58.75]That's a struggle for me.
[57:12.89]That was going to happen like two years ago.
[57:21.21]Who's never did it?
[57:28.84]Someone's just gonna steal that joke.
[57:30.48]Well, I hope it's funny.
[57:34.95]You're a sport.
[57:36.17]Ah!
[57:36.41]I have to play fucking Viva Pinata!
[57:57.42]This is a calm stream with a video in the background.
[58:05.91]You don't even want to play this, you know it.
[58:07.47]No, you are wrong!
[58:09.11]You are wrong!
[58:10.69]You are wrong!
[58:11.53]I think this is fun, and I think it's cute.
[58:18.01]He's not even playing.
[58:18.75]What do you mean, not even playing?
[58:22.81]This is... Look at the title of the stream.
[58:24.83]This is like looking at an aquarium that you've reached in sometimes.
[58:29.93]This is an interactive screensaver.
[58:32.46]I am playing.
[58:33.20]Okay.
[58:43.52]Look at how much fun they're having!
[58:46.40]Alright, slow down.
[58:50.74]I can't believe that you guys aren't getting behind, like... I can't believe, like, Quack Crew is not... Where's the Quack Crew at?
[58:58.20]Where's Quack Crew?
[58:59.22]Can I manufacture one?
[59:01.74]Can I, like, force one of these?
[59:03.23]I don't think I can do that, can I?
[59:05.97]Where's the Quack Crew?
[59:07.15]No, it doesn't work that way.
[59:09.27]This is like when some, like, company on social media desperately tries to make their own fucking version of a meme.
[59:14.35]And everyone's like, wow, that was fucking stupid and lame and shitty.
[59:18.12]Yeah, I can't.
[59:31.60]Quack pack.
[59:32.28]Yeah, where's the quack pack?
[59:35.80]Look it.
[59:37.40]Guys, where's the quack pack?
[59:40.70]Wow, nice game, Omega Lull.
[59:43.52]You didn't just think that that was fucking cute when he just drank the water out of the dirt there, like he just like licked it up off the ground.
[59:48.30]It was like cute.
[59:48.84]He like was laughing up like a dog.
[59:50.86]Like, fuck.
[59:52.10]Grimp.
[59:52.56]Grimp.
[59:53.32]Grimp.
[59:53.74]Grimp.
[59:54.32]Grimp.
[59:55.78]Grimp.
[59:57.06]What?
[59:59.66]But that's not what that noise makes.
[60:03.08]It's like... That's not Grimp.
[60:08.81]Grimp?
[60:09.85]Grimp?
[60:11.58]Stop distracting me!
[60:21.54]Okay.
[60:23.13]I gotta... I gotta water this.
[60:25.05]Is it already watered all the way?
[60:26.17]It's sitting in water.
[60:26.97]I heard he gets stupid.
[60:27.81]Alright, kill this.
[60:33.07]He sounds like a sim.
[60:42.56]Gemma, are you okay?
[60:44.64]Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
[60:46.92]What?
[60:47.22]What?
[60:47.50]What?
[60:49.02]Shit!
[60:50.66]Put this down!
[61:01.05]I'm fine.
[61:03.17]No, guys, I'm not gonna, like, after this... I don't know, some of you guys think I, like, after the stream is over, I, like, go and take a hot shower and just, like, scream into the water.
[61:11.81]Like...
[61:17.69]Like... I don't just fucking yell in the shower.
[61:20.23]I mean... I mean, I do... Everybody does that, though.
[61:25.25]Who... Alright, let me ask something.
[61:27.01]Who doesn't fill their mouth with water every, like... 45 seconds in the shower?
[61:33.40]And then just go... Spit it out.
[61:35.92]Everybody does that.
[61:38.00]Everybody just goes... And then just goes...
[61:43.28]If you don't, you're a liar if you don't do that.
[61:45.68]That's a lie.
[61:47.66]Everybody fills their mouth with the fucking water every, like, minute, and then just, like, just flushes it off their, out of their mouth.
[61:56.66]Yes, you do.
[61:57.32]I, no way.
[62:16.97]Bullshit.
[62:19.78]I don't think people watch me drink water.
[62:21.38]It freaks me out.
[62:26.24]I admit it.
[62:26.72]Laughing my ass off.
[62:27.54]Good.
[62:30.04]You seriously?
[62:30.50]Yes, you do.
[62:33.24]Imagine... Can you imagine lying about if you put water in your mouth and spit it out in the shower into the ground?
[62:39.69]Come on.
[62:44.53]I'm sorry, we don't- I don't drink it!
[62:46.35]I just- you go... And you go- who goes like this?
[62:58.06]Everybody does.
[62:59.70]You get in the shower and you go... Yes, you do!
[63:09.91]Yes, you do!
[63:12.66]You get in the shower and you go like this, and like, yes you do!
[63:16.56]Everybody does that!
[63:17.44]Next time you take a shower, I want you to be very aware of what you're doing.
[63:26.60]See, you don't even realize you're doing it.
[63:27.86]You get in, and like, the shower, you're waiting for the shower, because you're blocking the shower.
[63:30.96]It might not be hot enough, or too cold, or too hot.
[63:33.02]So you're like, just getting it ready, and then it... Yes, it is.
[63:35.36]I want you to be aware of it next time.
[63:38.06]And then you're gonna go, you're gonna get in the shower, you're gonna be like, that guy Dermot's a fucking idiot.
[63:42.26]He's so fucking weird.
[63:43.80]He's like the weirdest guy I've ever known in my life.
[63:49.36]He was right!
[63:56.31]And then I go, in a week, you're gonna fucking come to the stream, and you're gonna say, hey man, I've done a week of showers.
[64:01.98]And you were right.
[64:03.42]And I'll be like, I know.
[64:05.58]Welcome back.
[64:14.81]And then you're gonna do something that I don't even do.
[64:16.61]You're gonna go like this.
[64:22.91]And then you're going to be like, whoa, I do disgusting shit in here, apparently.
[64:26.87]And, oh, whoops.
[64:28.44]Oh, yeah, that's, oh, no.
[64:30.58]Gerber's the weirdo.
[64:31.62]Gerber the weirdo.
[64:32.74]He puts his hands up and, like, puts water in his mouth.
[64:35.88]Hold on a second.
[64:41.36]Unbelievable.
[64:44.06]Unbelievable.

[80:52.82]This is me pretending to be really excited for Battlefront.
[80:56.44]I need to explain this?
[80:57.72]Are you sure?
[80:58.74]I didn't play Battlefront.
[81:05.29]You need me to explain this?
[81:07.41]You can't get that from there.
[81:09.81]I don't have one minute in Battlefront.
[81:11.13]I need to apologize for this.
[81:21.26]You were 30 when you tweeted this.
[81:26.66]No, you just did the same thing!
[81:29.66]You just did the same fucking thing.
[81:31.38]This doesn't work.
[81:32.72]This does not work because you did the same exact thing.
[81:36.59]It did not change at all.
[81:43.46]This doesn't work.
[81:48.91]The only thing that happened was I was ready for the picture on the left one, and I wasn't ready for the picture on the right one.
[81:57.61]This is like the 30 selfies you take, and then you delete 28 of them.
[82:02.17]And you pick the one that you're like, wait, whoa, I look like a fucking weirdo in that one.
[82:09.50]You know just how much your face can fucking change in... Here's an experiment, okay?
[82:15.10]So we're gonna do this.
[82:17.27]Here's an experiment.
[82:18.25]What I'd like you to do is we're gonna... Remember, I'm taking selfies of myself over the course of three or four seconds.
[82:23.91]I would like for whoever wants to do this to take a frame, every frame of this, and we'll go over them.
[82:29.56]And we're gonna see how shitty half of them look.
[82:33.62]You ready?
[82:40.19]Here we go.

[82:56.98]Okay.
[82:59.20]So, um... At least... 40 of those 50 frames were terrible.
[83:04.67]They were terrible.
[83:12.81]Every frame is bad.
[83:16.35]Why are my eyes so huge?
[83:17.97]What?
[83:26.31]I've got big fucking eyes!
[83:29.65]There's no filter on.
[83:51.51]T minus hour and 40 minutes.
[83:54.69]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[84:05.46]Alita Battle Angel.
[84:08.42]They're not that big.
[84:09.58]That looks nice.
[84:12.72]It didn't even look good.
[84:13.88]Alright, look at me.
[84:15.41]I know everything about paving.
[84:27.21]That looks good.
[84:29.29]Yeah, that looks alright.
[84:36.49]That's fine.
[84:37.17]Somebody just said, you're surprised that I know what Alita Battle Angel is.
[84:44.92]Do you think that, okay, so after every stream, after every single fucking stream, there's just sand outside.
[84:53.31]And I just am like, alright, I'm done with the broadcast today.
[84:57.07]It's been swell.
[84:58.12]Okay, good night, everybody.
[84:59.68]And then 12 hours go by.
[85:03.76]Shh.
[85:24.52]Oh, fuck!
[85:26.28]That looked really bad.
[85:30.27]It looked like it was fake.
[85:34.17]Fucking goddammit.
[85:39.23]Stop playing.
[85:40.89]We're in it... No, we got an hour and a half left of this particular broadcast.
[85:46.52]We're all in at this point.
[85:47.74]I'm making at least one more duck.
[85:52.02]Worst hair.
[85:52.70]Worst hair.
[85:53.20]Fuck.
[85:53.90]It's alright.
[85:54.50]Whatever.
[85:55.40]It's not gonna win.
[85:56.16]Don't worry.
[85:57.56]I'll have a greasy ass head in like four months.
[86:00.79]What is this?
[86:04.19]What, do you guys think that changing the game is gonna change what's going on in the chat now?
[86:07.79]And what the stream is derailed into?
[86:10.59]This is not- This is- This is what we're doing.
[86:16.17]Why can I not open this image?
[86:23.53]That's Bill and Ted hair.
[86:25.11]Wait, somebody, wait, what?
[86:30.74]Bill and Ted?
[86:32.52]Why can I not, I can't even connect to the internet.
[86:37.42]No, does somebody have a comparison?
[86:40.86]Bill and Ted.
[86:42.30]Why can I not connect to the fucking internet?
[86:44.99]Am I stream still on?
[86:54.01]I can't open up any of these links.
[87:02.50]Is Discord having problems?
[87:13.89]Nice link, dude.
[87:22.23]What?
[87:25.90]What the fuck is this?

[87:41.31]This is normal eyes.
[87:43.33]Hold on.
[87:45.27]Normal?
[87:49.39]Right eye and right eye.
[87:51.09]What?
[87:52.17]What?
[87:55.20]Who looks better?
[87:55.74]This is left and left.
[88:01.68]Left and left doesn't look good.
[88:05.63]And this is eyes swapped.
[88:09.89]Which one looks the best?
[88:13.23]Alright, bottom right and bottom left look fucking awful.
[88:16.45]Top right, I think, looks the best to me.
[88:18.16]What do you think?
[88:22.04]Okay, if we're gonna rate these on order... Okay.
[88:27.74]Number one is top right.
[88:29.34]Number two is top left.
[88:31.78]Alright, fourth... I swapped as number three, and at the bottom is left.
[88:36.04]And my left eye is not the strong eye, huh?
[88:38.96]This eye is not the strong one.
[88:43.90]Look where top right is looking.
[88:45.14]I don't get it.
[88:52.59]Left and left is himbo-Jerma.
[89:07.70]I... No comments?
[89:18.57]What do you mean, no comments?
[89:25.85]Where's kitty floss?
[89:59.49]Thank you for watching!
[90:49.95]It's like the same face!
[91:06.45]It's the same- the same energy is coming off of these images!
[91:10.91]The same actor!
[91:26.41]Okay.
[91:27.95]That's enough.
[91:29.77]I'm done with this.
[91:33.47]Grow a beard?
[91:34.29]I can't grow a beard.
[91:35.99]You think I can grow a beard?
[91:37.21]This is the extent of what I'm capable of.
[91:40.27]You don't want to get it up close and personal here.
[91:42.09]You're gonna see all my nose hairs.
[91:43.65]They need to be trimmed.
[91:44.41]They're very, very long.
[91:46.32]They're very long.
[91:48.60]You don't want to see them.
[91:49.78]I don't want to get that close so you can see them.
[91:51.32]Then you can count how many.
[91:54.02]No.
[91:54.80]No, I haven't had time to do any trimming or any of this stuff.
[92:01.17]There's a spider on the ceiling.
[92:03.89]Oh, wow.
[92:06.45]There's a spider on the ceiling.
[92:07.93]Get a load of this guy.
[92:10.09]What the fuck?
[92:23.63]What the fuck am I doing?
[92:24.91]I just, like, stopped.
[92:36.45]Did you see that?
[92:39.10]You just watched the train leave the station on camera.
[92:42.66]It just, like, I was just here.
[92:45.44]I stopped.
[92:46.06]It was, like, I halted.
[92:48.78]It was like...
[92:54.77]His brain was empty.
[92:55.95]Alright, time to fill my brain with knowledge.
[93:00.28]What was I doing?
[93:01.04]I have no fucking... Oh, there's been no experience gained.
[93:05.30]Nothing's happened.
[93:07.10]And we're like halfway through the stream.
[93:11.20]What?
[93:11.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[93:28.82]I feel like this is one of the Muppets.
[93:45.99]Next ResidentSleeper.
[93:48.31]There is no next.
[93:49.70]There's a next tomorrow.
[93:51.52]There's an Ikaruga tomorrow.
[93:54.66]Not right now.
[93:56.38]Let me at least do the one thing I wanted to do.
[93:58.52]Please.
[94:00.27]Please.
[94:00.83]And that one thing was... Okay, I got the two ducks.
[94:06.78]They need to eat crabs.
[94:08.04]I need a crab.
[94:08.74]I need a surfboard, first of all.
[94:15.50]Odama tomorrow?
[94:17.40]I... I need to say this on camera because people apparently don't want to get this solidified into their brains.
[94:26.72]I will... Why am I blinking so much?
[94:30.37]I will never play Odama, the GameCube, ever again.
[94:35.53]Okay.

[95:44.96]Like, for me, that frog is like this.
[95:46.68]Like, not like this!

[107:04.18]Now I need a gecko house.
[107:13.86]Ooh, cool.
[107:17.16]Somebody said Resident Evil 4 sucks.
[107:20.28]Do you guys understand there's no way I could ever make all of you happy?
[107:23.92]Even if a majority of you guys want to see Resident Evil 4.
[107:27.79]Somebody just said Resident Evil 4 sucks.
[107:32.31]You know what I mean?

[108:56.41]I'm gonna buy a couple more of these.
[108:58.25]I'm gonna buy like four or five watercresses and put them along the edge here.
[109:01.85]Do I have enough money for that?
[109:05.72]Do a voice?
[109:06.52]I can't do... Oh, fuck.
[109:08.08]He's on fire.

[109:17.71]I think I get it.
[109:18.21]Just give me a minute.
[109:24.44]I think that, uh, I... Like, I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here, Scoob!
[109:32.79]Oh, yes!
[109:33.77]Ready!
[109:34.33]Like, maybe we should stop streaming, Scoob!
[109:40.35]I think maybe that's a good idea!
[109:41.81]Yes!
[109:43.25]Yes!
[109:43.73]Maybe stop streaming!
[109:49.81]Yes!
[109:49.93]Don't say, I didn't fucking try.
[109:52.11]Come back soon and try again.
[109:56.45]Okay Scooby-Doo isn't a Yoda horse.
[110:23.54]Um, what the fuck are you talking about?
[110:25.58]Oh
[110:28.58]Yes he is.
[110:32.97]Scooby-Doo can be absolutely described as a Yoda horse.
[110:43.51]Are you serious?
[110:46.96]Are you kidding me?
[110:51.70]It's true.
[110:54.54]What?

[111:27.18]I'm crying.
[111:28.02]There's not going to be a kitty floss.
[111:30.06]Because there are no kitty flosses that care about my house.
[111:33.61]They don't care about this place.
[111:37.25]Oh, look, a geckie.

[114:13.40]How do I get a moth drop to come stay?
[114:16.82]Permanently.
[114:20.57]Let's look it up.
[114:22.55]This is a baby game.
[114:23.45]Play dead or alive.
[114:24.33]Does anybody actually play that game?
[114:32.29]Like, do people play that game?
[114:35.19]Isn't that a fighting game?
[114:38.67]Did they just give up and just start making fucking, like, beach simulations?
[114:45.11]Did they still make Dead or Alive the fighting game?
[114:52.98]Isn't it good?
[114:53.82]Isn't Dead or Alive a good game?
[114:55.56]Like, fighting game-wise?
[114:57.20]Isn't it, like, a good game?
[115:04.10]It was.
[115:08.33]The old ones are pretty good, yeah.
[115:09.95]I'm just saying what I've heard.
[115:15.35]Alright, I don't think I even have any info.
[115:19.99]How do I attract one?
[115:21.11]There we go, moth drop.
[115:24.26]Peer requirements, nighttime in the garden.
[115:28.94]Alright, but have a light in the garden, nighttime in the garden.
[115:33.04]How do I make you stay?
[115:35.91]Wait for nighttime.
[115:45.85]Play Dead or Alive.
[115:46.71]I don't play fighting games.
[115:49.38]No, I don't play them.
[115:50.26]It's not even just like, oh, I don't stream that.
[115:52.82]It's just not.
[115:54.04]I just don't.
[115:54.56]Alright, there's a moth drop right here.
[115:59.29]Has eaten one bluebell flower.
[116:01.33]Here we go.
[116:02.27]Check this out.
[116:02.73]Bluebell flower.
[116:03.53]Plant him.
[116:11.16]Put a couple here, right in their spot that they like.
[116:22.54]Well, this is so pog.
[116:26.06]This is a pog-only stream, okay?
[116:31.96]I'll do fertilizer on these.
[116:32.94]Does it matter?
[116:33.40]Just blue fertilizer, right?
[116:34.52]Kind of pog, I guess.
[116:39.26]Pog only.
[116:42.24]So let's do, uh, fertilizer, plant a bunch of shit, and then get a bunch of fertilizer.
[116:50.58]What should I do first?
[116:51.27]Plant first, then fertilizer?
[116:52.61]Was it fertilize first, then plant, or plant, then fertilize?
[116:58.05]Fertilizer goes on afterwards, right?
[117:01.00]I know, like, you smeared my face up a little bit.
[117:09.38]God, I'm so... Okay.
[117:11.19]Very un-pog of you.
[117:12.17]I hope the same people doing ResidentSleeper do the same thing for Animal Crossing.
[117:15.65]People are happy.
[117:18.77]Um, I think that half the people doing that are doing it because they just want to cause chaos.
[117:25.64]They just want constant fucking conflict.
[117:31.52]I know, I saw it.
[117:32.56]I saw it.
[117:34.02]It's fertilizer after, right?
[117:36.23]We need bluebells.
[117:42.56]Do I not have it in my bag?
[117:43.78]Fuck.
[117:48.08]Ah!
[117:49.72]Mean flower.
[117:55.92]Just watch Family Guy funny moments.
[117:57.50]Why would I do that right now?
[118:01.42]Why would I watch Family Guy funny moments?
[118:08.21]There's no reason for me to do that.
[118:12.30]Alright, I need bluebell flowers.
[118:14.14]We need to feed these people.
[118:15.04]And then they're gonna go.
[118:17.38]And they're gonna, we're gonna have gecko.
[118:18.74]They're gonna have gecko babies.
[118:23.40]Watch TikTok compilations.
[118:24.72]Alright, fertilizer and seeds.
[118:26.76]I need seeds first, then fertilizer.
[118:28.16]No, no, no.
[118:28.54]Where's bluebell?
[118:44.29]Why don't I have access to this shit?
[118:47.50]Bluebell.
[118:49.20]Need to react.
[118:55.09]What I need to do is... Holy shit, he's zooming around.
[118:57.77]You see that?
[118:58.15]Look at them.
[118:58.57]Look at how fast they're running.
[119:11.61]Well, don't touch it then!
[119:12.77]Don't touch the fire!
[119:14.19]Are you stupid?
[119:14.99]Alright, here we go.
[119:17.21]Plant.
[119:18.01]Fertilize.
[119:19.80]Action!
[119:25.06]Jerma, play my favorite game or I unsub.
[119:27.42]Good morning.
[119:28.72]Can I interest you in something seedy?
[119:31.26]No, I don't mean like that.
[119:33.10]That's what you could title this stream.
[119:35.66]I could just change the title of this stream to Jerma play the game I like or unsub.
[119:40.00]That could be the title today.
[119:47.81]Alright, we need blue fertilizer.
[120:00.85]Fertilize.
[120:04.70]Fertilization.
[120:08.24]Didn't get this one, did I?
[120:11.22]Yep.
[120:12.02]What about this one over here?
[120:12.88]Did I get this one?
[120:16.56]Yep.
[120:17.48]Okay.
[120:19.64]Water.
[120:22.14]He's not playing Farming Simulator.
[120:28.57]I am... I am gonna lose it.
[120:34.55]Play Monkey Island.
[120:35.61]I am gonna lose it.
[120:39.50]Play Touhou.
[120:43.92]Until like four days ago, I didn't even know what that was.
[120:49.59]It's... Can I... Give me a second!
[121:00.22]It's really good.
[121:01.78]Alright!
[121:02.22]It's like... Wait, why can I not do this anymore?
[121:11.40]Here they go.
[121:15.42]Alright, bluebells are up.
[121:22.35]This is like you recommended a movie.
[121:24.69]Hey man, you should really go see Star Wars Return of Skywalker.
[121:29.59]Okay.
[121:31.29]Yeah, that sounds like a good movie.
[121:32.59]Maybe I'll check it out eventually.
[121:34.14]Maybe I'll do it.
[121:34.72]Yeah, I'll probably watch it.
[121:36.06]No, go right now.
[121:38.28]I don't want to go watch the new Star Wars movie right now.
[121:41.40]I've got some stuff to do.
[121:42.28]No, go right now or I'm not your friend anymore.
[121:45.58]Um...
[121:47.10]Can I just give me a couple days to figure out?
[121:49.76]I gotta look at movie times.
[121:51.42]There's one plane at 5.30.
[121:53.44]Go now.
[121:54.48]Here, let me help you.
[121:55.47]And you start pushing me out of my house.
[121:57.93]Let me help you.
[121:58.89]Just go out there.
[121:59.93]You open the car door.
[122:01.51]Get in.
[122:03.03]I don't want to go see the movie right now.
[122:04.25]Get in and drive the car now.
[122:06.25]Alright, fine.
[122:07.19]Jesus.
[122:08.51]And then you stand there straight in the air like a pencil until I come back.
[122:15.42]Then I get out, I'm finally out, like, God, if I get back from the movie... You're still there.
[122:20.54]Like, and I pull the car into the fucking driveway, and the lights hit you, and you're fucking still there, standing, staring.
[122:28.61]And then the... Of the door opening.
[122:32.39]What's that best movie you've ever seen in your life?
[122:34.99]Um, well, I... Yeah, I know, I liked it too.
[122:37.24]It was my favorite movie I've ever seen in my whole life.
[122:38.94]That's your favorite movie you've ever seen in your whole life, right?
[122:41.70]Uh, sure.
[122:42.68]I thought it was great.
[122:43.94]Cool.
[122:44.04]Cool.
[122:45.67]What are you doing tomorrow?
[122:48.68]Um, I don't know, man.
[122:49.86]You should go see this movie.
[122:52.50]I'll stand here.
[122:53.00]I'll be ready.
[122:56.36]I tried to kill it in time.
[123:01.12]Did I get it?
[123:02.50]I did.
[123:06.98]Can you stop with the movie recommendations?
[123:11.02]Never.
[123:21.06]He hates it.
[123:24.18]Why were you friends with this person in the first place?
[123:32.99]Why were you friends with this person in the first place?
[123:42.33]Because they were a pretty normal guy until the subject of movies came up.
[123:54.57]Kitty, please.
[123:55.87]I can't... Look, the kitty's gonna come eat... The kitty's gonna come eat a bug if the kitty wants to.
[124:07.48]Oh, crap.
[124:11.60]I still can't get a surfboard.
[124:14.86]Here we go.
[124:15.60]Alright.
[124:16.78]Where's my gecko friends?
[124:22.52]Four daisies in the garden.
[124:23.90]Oh, fuck.
[124:26.53]You should play Roblox.
[124:29.81]And that's another one, right?
[124:32.19]Like, Roblox is so much shit.
[124:33.89]It's like, Roblox is not, like, the game Roblox.
[124:36.91]It's the infrastructure Roblox.
[124:39.69]And I've seen that often, too.
[124:40.69]And that's the equivalent of not telling me to go see a specific movie.
[124:43.55]That's telling me to go just spend my whole day in the movie theater.
[124:48.91]Right?
[124:49.23]And just, hey, can you, like, pick a cool movie to watch in the movie theater?
[124:55.68]I... I... I guess.
[124:56.76]What are you doing?
[125:09.53]You're not even... You don't have to live here, man.
[125:12.49]Don't watch all the Star Wars movies.
[125:14.15]Alright, I need to wait until night time.
[125:16.73]Are these ready to be harvested?
[125:20.67]Choo!
[125:23.22]Choo!
[125:23.38]Choo!
[125:23.64]Choo!
[125:23.80]Choo!
[125:24.10]Choo!
[125:24.24]Choo!
[125:29.12]Let's get some info here.
[125:44.31]Okay.
[125:46.05]He's eaten one moth drop.
[125:47.73]I gotta get the moth drops to show up.
[125:52.74]He never went back to that game?
[125:54.30]Yeah, because I bought like a bootleg copy of it and it fucked up.
[126:00.58]Do I have my sneeze button still?
[126:01.78]Uh, I don't know.
[126:02.44]What is this one?
[126:04.36]What's that doing?
[126:08.46]No, I don't.
[126:09.02]Actually, it's gone.
[126:10.26]That's sad.
[126:10.62]Alright, here we go.
[126:16.37]Here come the moth drops.
[126:18.65]Eat these bells.
[126:22.17]Hurry, hurry, I'm only 400 pounds!
[126:25.89]Hurry, feed me, feed me more!
[126:27.25]I'm only 350 pounds!
[126:30.09]I think that's the the thing of the arcade from like 20 years ago that then you throw the balls in the lady's mouth and she gets fatter
[127:00.88]Come on, what?
[127:08.14]I'm under Wi-Fi.
[127:09.04]Something like that, yeah.
[127:10.42]Alright, where are the fuck are these moths?
[127:13.11]Look it, I got everything they want right here.
[127:18.49]You promised me a kitty.
[127:20.53]I can't unless the kitty decides to come over here and eat one of the mice.
[127:26.39]I'm trying to make the geckos do the gecko dance because I want to see it.
[127:33.13]That game used to terrify me as a kid.
[127:40.28]Yeah.
[127:43.04]It... Yeah, it was fucking crazy.
[127:46.66]Check its visit requirements.
[127:47.68]Yeah, it needs blue... It needs these bells and needs these lights.
[127:51.61]And it says nighttime.
[127:53.55]So where is it?
[127:56.93]Excuse me.
[127:58.11]Are you here yet?
[128:00.23]Moth drop.
[128:01.39]Eat a bluebell flower.
[128:03.68]Look what's over here, eat it!
[128:15.61]Yes.
[128:18.41]No, wrong image.
[128:20.03]Uh, yes.
[128:22.78]This is Big Bertha, and what you would do is you would throw balls into this, there was a little ball thing that was underneath down here, and it was like a little tray, and you had to throw the balls into her mouth, and there was an inflatable thing underneath where her shirt is.
[128:40.81]And every time you put another ball, a ball went in, it would inflate a little more until Big got huge.
[128:53.81]And points were weight.
[128:56.79]And every time you'd get, like, two or three, four, five balls in, she'd say, like, I'm only 200 pounds!
[129:01.90]I can be much fatter than this!
[129:04.46]And then it'd be like, I'm only... You'd cut it off sometimes.
[129:06.72]So if you had, like, three or four friends all doing it at the same time, it was like, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[129:11.64]It would be like, I'm only three!
[129:13.68]I'm three!
[129:14.08]I'm 400!
[129:14.72]I'm only 500 pounds!
[129:15.94]You can do better!
[129:17.42]And then the timer would run out, and then she would laugh.
[129:21.48]And then you'd put 25 cents in and you would do it again.
[129:25.44]Until you were out of money.
[129:27.08]And then you'd go buy four Tootsie Rolls at the counter with the tickets you won.
[129:31.94]Did I get a moth drop yet?
[129:37.86]Bingo.
[129:39.10]Bah.
[129:39.78]Bah.
[129:40.14]Bingo.
[129:41.12]Do it.
[129:43.78]Please.
[129:49.90]Eat one of these.
[129:51.56]8-1.
[129:52.32]Yeah!
[129:54.34]Alright, go.
[130:12.14]Now we have a resident mop drop.
[130:15.66]We need another one.
[130:17.24]And then we can feed the geckos.
[130:22.39]He's still playing pinata.
[130:25.21]Yeah, I mean, for now... For now, yeah.
[130:30.89]And I'm probably not going to play this tomorrow.
[130:32.57]I just want to make a couple more geckos.
[130:36.17]I'm playing Ikaruga tomorrow.
[130:37.94]Oh, they're actually kind of cool looking.
[130:47.57]He hates Viva Pinata.
[130:49.36]He hates Viva Pinata.
[130:50.90]No.
[130:52.18]No, you hate Viva Pinata.
[130:55.52]You hate Viva Pinata.
[130:56.88]Not me.
[130:58.26]At least don't need to be a plant dried out.
[131:12.03]What?
[131:12.13]What?
[131:16.76]Stop fucking touching this.
[131:18.38]You're gonna get hurt.
[131:19.24]Come here.
[131:19.55]Alright, now... I need another moth drop.
[131:28.48]You need to eat one of these moth drops, but not yet.
[131:32.17]We need another moth drop, two moth drops, we're going to have moth drops, and then we're going to have a gecko baby.
[131:37.13]Why are your lips so red?
[131:38.77]They're not.
[131:39.61]They're not.
[131:40.33]The white balance on this camera is tilted to a point where it's all red.
[131:46.53]My eyes are red, though, because I've only slept like two or three hours a night the last five straight days.
[131:50.91]So that's accurate.
[131:55.56]Doc, Patch here.
[131:58.50]where am I needed I'm ready for healing and stuff that's an exaggeration it's probably been like four it's probably been like four hours a night maybe four and a half I'll make a little liar it's maybe like three or four plus maybe four and a half four
[132:30.93]Stop streaming and go to bed.

[159:08.58]Wait, can you both just eat it together?
[159:09.88]It just dropped a peanut.
[159:12.46]One more to eat!
[159:13.73]Maybe they don't have, maybe I can keep that one moth.

[159:46.57]That's not the right moth.
[159:49.09]Why do you not live here?
[159:51.25]Are you- Moth- No, this is not even the right one.
[159:55.31]Where is this motherfucker?
[159:56.35]Did somebody help me out here?
[159:59.35]Where's this other moth drop that moved in?
[160:08.84]On the sand building?
[160:12.48]Oh, I thought that was part of the fucking- I thought that was part of the decorat- the design!

[160:53.88]Wow.
[160:55.10]Whoa.
[160:56.00]Unbelievable.
[160:57.10]Unbelievable.
[160:57.82]You do the fucking Barney the Dinosaur character, and everybody decides it's time to go now.
[161:17.82]Actually mad.
[161:21.22]Alright, let's do it.

[161:42.01]I just started singing the apples and bananas song from Barney the Dinosaur, and you think that's me pandering views.
[161:53.74]It's time to see what this sex thing is.
[161:59.62]What, are you saying that the audience is like 10 years old?
[162:05.64]What is that thing?
[162:07.32]Sour Profitimal.
[162:16.60]Well, just hit him in the head with a fucking hammer or whatever this is.
[162:23.97]Hit him in the face with a shovel.
[162:25.67]He'll go away.
[162:35.59]Where is he?
[162:38.50]Are you guys ready to see the dance of the geckos?
[162:42.36]You ready?
[162:42.66]This is gonna be sick.
[162:44.14]Here it comes.
[162:47.67]We've been waiting two days for this.
[162:49.37]Alright, let me see.
[163:04.33]So we go... bottom?
[163:07.11]I don't know, who cares.
[163:17.85]This is really hard to control.
[163:19.25]It is.
[163:19.93]Trust me when I say that.
[163:21.13]This is very difficult to control this.
[163:24.45]It's very, very sloppy.
[163:31.57]Change camera.
[163:32.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[163:53.70]Term of the time, I'm fine.
[163:54.82]Alright, let's see the dance.
[164:01.40]Let's go!
[164:04.84]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, I gotta get back to the house!
[164:09.97]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, she's coming over!
[164:12.05]Oh my god, oh no, no, no, no, no, I gotta make sure, is the bed clean?
[164:14.75]Does the bed smell?
[164:16.59]Oh fuck!
[164:17.71]Is there trash in my fucking counter?
[164:20.65]Shit, yeah, just one second!
[164:23.31]Throw it on the fucking ground and push it in the corner.
[164:24.81]Where's the Febreze?
[164:27.33]Alright, we're ready.
[164:36.63]Come on, come on in.
[164:37.69]Fuck, come on in.
[164:54.63]I love this one.
[165:00.32]That was great.
[165:07.88]That was awesome.
[165:09.78]I want to see what the duck one is so bad.
[165:11.94]What about this?
[165:16.18]Can we see the snake one at least?
[165:18.67]Raw bean.
[165:24.88]Egg delivered.
[165:28.63]Maybe we'll get to see the cat one.
[165:33.91]New seeds.
[165:43.09]A new pi√±ata's in the desert?
[165:44.79]A new pi√±ata's been spotted in the keen arctic.
[165:49.63]Let's go check it out.
[165:52.72]Wait.
[165:54.26]Evil.
[166:05.39]Dermacursed.png!
[166:06.43]He's probably going to be like... I mean, that's pretty cursed.
[166:09.33]That's pretty cursed, you're right.
[166:27.20]Now all we need this to do is we need this to move.
[166:30.36]So the mouth is constantly moving forward and another head's coming out of the mouth.
[166:34.15]You know what I mean?
[166:34.59]Like those weird images that just keep going forward at you.
[166:38.33]Or keep going backwards or whatever it is.
[166:51.37]That's a JoJo reference?
[166:53.17]Oh.
[166:54.51]Sorry.
[166:55.49]Sorry, I just gave you a JoJo reference.
[166:59.35]I'm waiting for him to come in.
[167:00.07]He'll come in in a second.
[167:02.55]Right when you cross that line, that's it.
[167:04.07]That's it!
[167:04.57]You crossed it!
[167:05.45]You crossed it!
[167:08.17]That's the line!
[167:09.21]You're off sides!
[167:17.13]If only you'd stayed over there, I wouldn't have hit you.
[167:32.08]Wait, there's another one?
[167:35.30]The fuck?
[167:43.55]This reminds me of a song.
[167:47.25]I want attention.
[167:50.71]Only 11 minutes remain in the stream.
[167:54.07]Only 11 minutes remain in the stream.
[167:58.69]I have no... What's wrong?
[168:04.61]Oh, I got it.
[168:05.19]My phone just started.
[168:05.89]Oh, I got a notification.
[168:09.01]Okay.
[168:09.43]I only have a little bit more time left.
[168:10.95]I got the notification.
[168:11.79]11.
[168:18.98]That's it?
[168:19.30]The fuck?
[168:23.82]I thought I had more time than that.
[168:24.80]That's weird.
[168:33.08]Alright.
[168:33.52]Oh, what was I doing?
[168:35.91]I need that cat.
[168:37.19]A cat has to show up.
[168:38.29]Wait, isn't that a cat?
[168:39.79]This is your cat right here.
[168:42.71]No, it's not.
[168:43.25]Ooh, apples.
[168:52.52]These don't sell for very much.
[168:59.92]Just keep them.
[169:04.81]Hazelnut seed.
[169:06.67]Who wants one of these?
[169:07.55]Oh, there he is!
[169:09.33]He's so cute!

[170:50.21]That doesn't even fit on his face.
[170:51.27]There's nothing more than these teeth.
[171:06.20]Funky to- Ooh, a tie!

[177:11.71]They can't- Can they breed together?
[177:13.81]Can I do that?
[177:14.47]Does it have to be duck and duck or can it be duck and juicy duck?
[177:18.07]Can I do that?
[177:26.71]No, I can't.
[177:29.61]It's gotta be duck and duck.
[177:31.32]And now there's no-
[177:39.76]Just buy a duck.
[177:41.08]Should I sell Juicy Duck?
[177:43.60]That's a lot of money.

[179:07.31]Yeah, we haven't done this yet, so we'll be able to send him to the party.
[179:14.13]Yeah, we're going to get a lot of experience for this.
[179:19.01]Fire him away.
[179:22.98]Award for sending to a party.
[179:24.12]Yes!
[179:24.62]More, more, more!
[179:25.10]Level 17?

[179:48.40]They come back.
[179:54.80]They come back.
[180:07.01]Sent to the party!
[180:11.03]No, they come back.
[180:11.65]They're just going to the party.

[180:21.12]Sell.
[180:22.52]Sell.
[180:28.88]No, don't sell this.
[180:29.64]Okay, sell.
[180:35.92]They do come back.
[180:36.72]Going to the party means you get your guts.
[180:38.78]What?
[180:53.18]Anytime these things are within two or three pixels of each other, or like 200, whatever they are, it's so hard to select anything.
[181:01.53]There's snapping in the game, and it's wonky.
[181:08.64]Cat alert.
[181:10.38]Milk time!
[181:13.80]I did promise before the stream ended that I was gonna go get a cat.
[181:22.10]Attention, chat has detected cat.
[181:25.13]Milk.
[181:25.55]No, milk is not a vegetable.
[181:32.43]Milk is not a vegetable as much as the American food pyramid would like for you to know and believe.
[181:42.17]Bone.
[181:46.81]14 fucking hundred.
[181:47.55]This is so much money.
[181:50.64]I hope you like this.
[182:25.63]Get rid of this shit.
[182:27.41]Hey!
[182:27.67]Fuck!
[182:28.77]Get out of here!
[182:36.54]Don't, Juicy Goose, don't eat that food.
[182:39.42]It's bad for you.
[182:47.63]Do not eat that food.
[182:49.05]Leave it alone.
[182:49.49]Don't touch it.
[182:50.37]Nobody touch this food.
[182:51.27]It's bad.
[182:51.65]It's poisonous.
[182:53.41]Was this a mushroom?
[182:54.61]What is this?
[182:55.01]Is this alive?
[182:59.80]Oh.
[183:03.94]I don't know what it was.
[183:06.76]Okay, now...
[183:17.91]These apples.
[183:19.31]Who needs to eat one of these?
[183:21.22]Somebody has to eat one.
[183:21.96]Where's my duck?
[183:24.52]I need a crab, too.
[183:25.72]I need a surfboard.
[183:26.74]Fuck.

[183:50.09]There's no... Where do I get it?
[183:53.77]Garden item?
[183:58.89]Surfboard.
[183:59.37]There we go.
[184:01.31]Alright, good.
[184:11.18]Now I can bring crabs in.
[184:12.06]What the fuck is a...
[184:16.46]Evil bat.
[184:17.06]I know.
[184:17.40]I see him.
[184:26.55]Go to the desert?
[184:27.33]I will after I get rid of evil bat.
[184:44.68]So I have two apples that I think I can... Attention.
[184:50.40]You have over five minutes of your allotted minutes allowed on stream.
[184:55.81]Each minute after this momentary interruption will cost the streamer $15 per minute.
[185:06.30]The clock is still here, though.
[185:08.74]That should be fine.
[185:10.95]Got a text.
[185:11.97]I don't... I don't know who's texting me right now, but I'm getting, like, notified.
[185:15.59]I don't want to fucking even see it.
[185:17.13]I'm streaming.
[185:17.95]What the fuck?
[185:30.78]Where's a cat?
[185:38.66]Where's a crab?
[185:42.34]Oh, a duck!

[187:24.63]I'm waiting to tame a cat.
[187:29.27]And I'm waiting for a crab to show up.
[187:32.15]When a crab shows up, I can breed the ducks, play Lisa the Painful.
[187:40.03]What on Earth?
[187:41.49]What?
[187:46.05]Alright, we're gonna get the camera onto this one.
[187:48.31]I probably will never play Lisa the Painful on this stream.
[187:57.21]I've got to make all these statements today.
[188:05.15]No, I said probably.
[188:07.05]I... Alright, I said probably.
[188:08.25]I gotta fix that.
[188:09.57]I will never play Lisa the Painful on this stream.
[188:14.22]There you go.
[188:14.78]I have to... Sometimes you gotta fucking just pull the band-aid off.
[188:26.34]Go to the Desert of Riot.
[188:29.37]I'd like to see you try.
[188:38.01]I don't see anything new.
[188:44.61]I see Chad Bird.
[188:45.35]I see everything that I've seen already.
[188:50.96]Where's a new pinata?
[189:02.06]The box.
[189:03.88]The box.
[189:05.12]What box?
[189:08.64]Go to the... They were telling you to play Desert Bus, not go to the desert.
[189:15.08]I already did play Desert Bus, and I gave up after about 15 minutes.
[189:19.28]I did Desert Bus VR, and I was like, oh, this is kind of... I'm done.
[189:22.85]Wait.
[189:24.69]Wait.
[189:37.05]Let's reload the area.
[189:50.32]Why won't you play Lisa the Painful?
[189:51.76]Because I don't want to.
[189:54.88]I don't want to play that on stream.
[189:56.58]I'm not going to.
[189:58.24]That's all the reason I need.
[189:59.22]I have to give you a written essay as to why I'm not going to play Lisa the Painful on this stream?
[190:07.47]Is that my homework for next time?
[190:25.04]Wait!
[190:25.76]Nope.
[190:28.44]Let's go to the Arctic.
[190:35.36]Lisa's like Dark Souls, though.
[190:36.66]No, it's not.
[190:38.08]It's not.
[190:39.78]It's like an RPG.
[190:40.86]Like a top-down.
[190:41.64]It's not.
[190:43.08]Yeah, nice try, though.
[190:45.30]You would've got me to play it.
[190:50.65]Oh!
[190:51.03]Penguins!
[190:55.49]It isn't top-down?
[190:56.97]My whole world is upside-down.
[191:00.09]Pengum!
[191:03.41]I kind of wish I'd, you know, made a... Really wish I made kind of an ice place.
[191:06.08]What are you doing here?
[191:07.20]Should I bring... Will a penguin be able to exist in my land?
[191:09.40]Maybe I should get him.
[191:10.64]Alright, let's get him.
[191:32.67]It's never too late for a well-placed... That's got a lucky feel.
[191:36.23]Alright, what is he like?
[191:43.92]Something hot.
[191:45.82]Something hot.
[191:49.25]Alright, I can do... How about a... Is it a Holly berry?
[191:55.11]What's hot?
[191:57.81]Is a Holly berry hot?
[191:59.03]Is this hot?
[192:08.87]No, hey!
[192:12.41]Get out.
[192:13.55]You... idiot.
[192:16.49]And now they're running away.
[192:19.24]Just...
[192:35.09]Alright.
[192:36.35]Where did we get a crab?
[192:38.46]Juicy duck having a fun time.
[192:41.98]Seed guy.
[192:42.50]Come here.
[192:53.14]Gold.
[192:53.48]Gold's more valuable.
[192:54.42]Gold is.
[192:54.96]I was just saying something that stupid.
[192:57.30]Is this a yam?
[193:08.66]Fear tree?
[193:14.88]Punish him with a shove of- You guys are twisted.
[193:21.10]You guys are twisted!
[193:21.94]You guys are so fucking twisted.
[193:25.48]I can plant some more of these trees.
[193:28.56]Uh, how about over here?
[193:31.70]I'll do some more of these trees.

[193:44.36]Well, there's milk just sitting there.
[193:47.84]Look, I can't... What's that old saying?
[193:50.26]You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
[193:55.78]What do you want me to do?
[194:06.19]Stop being so cool and go over here.
[194:09.81]Get over here!

[238:05.32]Sneakers.
[238:06.36]I don't have enough money.
[238:09.59]I don't care.
[238:17.29]I won't say bye.
[238:18.03]I don't have enough money.
[238:26.41]There he goes.
[238:27.75]What does it take to romance for a cat?
[238:33.25]He's eating a can of dairy.
[238:40.87]I want to wake you up because I want to get a good view of you.
[238:59.86]Fucking just bizarre.
[239:02.00]Okay.
[239:08.84]Name the cat.
[239:09.64]Name the cat what?
[239:18.93]Whatever.
[239:22.55]Save that.
[239:24.95]Name the cat Fart.
[239:26.21]Sure.
[239:40.70]Here's the best part about this.
[239:41.74]Eventually... Uh, if somebody else ever gets a hold of this Xbox for any reason... Like, if I get rid of it or if I don't, like, if I get to wipe the drive or whatever... Someone will be able to actually open this if they have Viva Pinata.
[239:55.04]You think I'm gonna delete the save?
[239:56.02]Why would I do that?
[239:58.98]There you go.
[239:59.80]There's Bart the cat.
[240:04.03]Can I get, like, the band of all, like, the weirdos?
[240:06.11]Come here.
[240:16.41]What the fuck?
[240:20.41]Now what?
[240:32.50]It seemed very necessary.
[240:33.96]It's time to... me?
[240:35.42]Alright, I want to take a good picture of all the weirdos.
[240:39.00]Come here.
[240:39.50]Wait, where are you going?
[240:41.34]Oh no, world 15 is one that's sick.
[240:44.35]Oh.
[241:08.74]cut cut a cut no no bark bark
[241:33.94]I have a dog and a cat.
[241:35.44]I think the bark bark has been drawn to your garden by its rival.
[241:38.46]What do you mean rival?
[241:44.99]You have puzzle gums to scare the ruffy in a way.
[241:49.09]Have a kitty floss in the garden.
[241:58.97]So how do I make him stay?
[242:00.13]Oh no, he's sick too.
[242:02.80]Call the doctor.
[242:05.20]I need a bouncer.
[242:06.68]Don't worry.
[242:07.40]Whatever.
[242:07.68]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[242:11.04]Oh, there he is.
[242:11.64]What do I do?
[242:13.89]How do I take care of him?
[242:16.75]What does he do?
[242:20.25]No.
[242:20.41]I didn't want to hit the fucking duck.
[242:21.99]Is this like a boss?
[242:29.10]Did he shit his pants?
[242:39.89]What do I do about this?
[242:57.05]I don't really want to get close enough to add to... This dude just fucking runs up on my shit.
[243:03.11]Alright, who's the bouncer?
[243:20.47]That was the cat.
[243:29.80]See you tomorrow.
[243:35.82]God damn it.
[243:36.44]Whatever.
[243:37.50]Did I save it before that?
[243:39.08]Who cares.
[243:41.32]Fuck.
[243:44.64]Inhaling the candy.
[243:46.56]He's inhaling.
[243:47.76]He's inhaling fart.
[243:58.36]That's where we end it.
[243:59.46]Goodnight.
[243:59.88]Goodbye.
[244:00.84]See you tomorrow.
[244:01.46]We're gonna play Ikaruga tomorrow.
[244:08.12]Holy shit.
[244:10.12]All that just to have him be instantly killed.
[244:12.18]That's fucking horrible.
[244:13.78]Alright, let's do the bits and hang out for a little bit.
[244:17.12]See you guys tomorrow.
[244:18.80]For Ikaruga.
[244:22.54]Good night, everybody.
[244:27.77]Let's go back in time to earlier today.
[244:32.13]We had 250 from StyxRenegade.
[244:35.13]I say, hey everyone, Jerma here.
[244:36.77]Just bought this new clown car here.
[244:38.13]It's fun to drive up here in the Las Vegas strip, but you know that, you know what I like more than materialistic things?
[244:43.28]Jerma knowledge.
[244:44.80]Okay, in fact, I'm a lot more proud of these seven new shelves that I had to get installed to hold 2,000 new bottles of CBD oil that I bought from my boomer back.
[244:53.88]Like the trillionaire Barry F. Bugleberry says, if you don't have LinkedIn, you gotta get on LinkedIn.
[245:02.96]CBD oil, what the fuck?
[245:06.06]What's Ikaruga?
[245:06.94]It's a bullet hell game.
[245:07.99]It'd be really fun.
[245:20.85]Thank you, Trans Scout, for the 500 bits.
[245:22.93]Jerma, tell us about the cat you mentioned having.
[245:25.25]Also, thanks for playing Viva.
[245:26.35]It's nice to have a chill stream in the background while writing.
[245:29.97]You're referring to Young Soi, which is Kim's cat, or was Kim's cat, until it was given to one of her friends as we moved and didn't really have the opportunity to bring the cat to Las Vegas.
[245:57.57]And originally, that was Kim's... Kim sort of got young Soy... It was sort of, I think, from my understanding, it was she was taking care of that cat temporarily.
[246:15.60]Because that was not really hers to begin with, I guess.
[246:19.12]It was like a stray, and she was just doing her best to take care of the cat until she sort of figured out what we were going to do.
[246:38.13]Would you ever want a cat?
[246:40.68]I've had lots of cats before.
[246:43.30]My family had at least six, five or six of them.
[246:47.44]One of my old cats was actually in a video.
[246:51.76]And... I mean, that cat has since left this Earth.
[246:57.59]But I've had cats a lot.
[246:59.91]At least five or six of them over the couple decades where I was in my parents' house, you know.
[247:07.21]update the wiki but the purpose we were trying to we were trying to get young soy a good permanent home that was the plan what video
[247:37.05]Uh, what video was that cat in?
[247:42.13]Is Jerma's voice higher than usual?
[247:44.29]Wait, it shouldn't be.
[247:46.49]How's that?
[247:48.48]It was in the egg video.
[247:49.98]What?
[247:56.14]It was in the egg video?
[247:58.60]Oh, fuck!
[248:00.37]I completely forgot that the egg video was not an- It was not the egg video!
[248:05.94]It was, here's a setup video, right?
[248:09.34]Wasn't half that video, I was like so scared to upload like a weird fucked up video, so I was like, this is a setup video.
[248:14.96]Here's my computer, here's the specs, and here's a wicked fucked up video now, right?
[248:21.20]That was back when I was scared to show you how fucked up of a person I really was.
[248:25.09]Yeah, that makes sense.
[248:29.31]Yeah, that makes sense.
[248:40.63]But thank you to Invaders for the 250.
[248:42.83]It's been a minute since I've sent a rat update.
[248:48.73]Rat update.
[248:49.23]We ended up putting all four of them in a huge rat condo together.
[248:52.71]They're very happy.
[248:54.05]But since all this pandemic stuff has been going on, I haven't been able to visit them at my sister's house.
[248:59.77]Anyway, thanks for keeping my spirits up while I waste away at home.
[249:02.77]Here's a cute pic of the rat boys.
[249:05.57]Oh, wow.
[249:12.64]Look, they're all chewing something.
[249:14.66]That's the best part.
[249:20.31]Look at this.
[249:21.83]Every single one of them is like, I'm going to chew this.
[249:23.63]I'm going to chew this one.
[249:25.33]This is mine.
[249:25.87]Everyone get out of here.
[249:26.47]This is mine.
[249:33.38]Okay, everybody has something to chew.
[249:35.62]I'm chewing on this ball.
[249:36.62]I'm chewing on this thing.
[249:38.42]I'm chewing on this over here.
[249:42.17]Oh, these are so awesome.
[249:43.93]They're so cute.
[249:46.19]Pretty sick rat update.
[249:47.39]Thank you.
[249:49.80]And we had, uh, Alex gave 500 bits.
[249:52.54]No message, just Alex92, 500 bits.
[249:53.44]VeryNoise gave, I think, almost $100 here, total.
[250:05.13]$20 in bits.

[250:09.10]They say one more for the road.

[250:12.18]That was very nice.
[250:15.68]Thank you.
[250:18.64]I missed big bits here from freshly brewed cider.
[250:25.89]That's $50 that I missed a couple hours ago.
[250:30.96]I'm sorry that I missed this, but you got a great name.
[250:34.53]Uh, thanks for the $50.
[250:35.09]Hey Jerm, I've been watching you since the TF2 days, and I want to thank you for the hours of laughter.
[250:39.83]You're without a doubt the best E-clown the world has ever seen.
[250:44.25]I'm glad you think that.
[250:45.41]By the way, Bugleberry is an amazing character, and anyone who says otherwise couldn't recognize genius if it hit them in the face.
[250:53.64]What a fucking intelligent person.
[250:55.36]You know what I mean?
[250:59.23]You can get the smarts on this one, seriously.
[251:02.65]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[251:03.29]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.

[253:09.17]I'm happy to be your favorite any streamer, so thank you.
[253:13.45]SuperBruce, thanks for 500 bits.
[253:16.14]Jeremy, I've seen a lot of recognition to groups like the Quack Pack, the Drew Crew, the Bugle Bunch, etc.
[253:21.25]But when will you acknowledge Chat's original fan group?
[253:24.57]We're still here, Jeremy.
[253:26.59]The Floygan flock does not forget.
[253:28.81]We demand Floygan Brothers.
[253:31.04]No.
[253:34.26]Okay, so go get a Dreamcast and go buy Floygan Brothers and play it.
[253:39.75]I'm not playing that fucking game.
[253:41.47]I'm sorry.
[253:42.93]Like, there's no reason to ever open that.
[253:46.81]Like, let me tell you, you could play Floygan Brothers if you want to.
[253:50.31]If you're part of the Floygan flock, just get a Dreamcast forehead, just get Floygan Brothers forehead, and just play Floygan Brothers forehead, right?
[253:59.62]Something like that.
[254:03.31]I played Floygan Brothers for like 40 minutes.
[254:06.80]Not even, like 35 minutes.
[254:09.41]There's not enough time for you to make a go-kru about it.
[254:14.28]quack pack I mean I've streamed viva pinata like four times now okay right that makes sense drew crew we've played through at least two full drew crew games and like another six five or six streams of the drew crew moo crew I played both black and whites at least four or five streams of black and white I mean but like the floygan flock I that's like it's like 27 minutes of on-stream camera time
[254:41.31]Wink, dink, citizens.
[254:42.35]Okay, maybe, but yeah.
[254:44.91]Because the winks were a thing for like two months.
[254:47.96]It was fucking gold.
[254:49.08]Alright, okay.
[254:52.12]I'm not going to play Floygan Brothers again.
[254:53.66]Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to slam this water.
[255:00.95]We want Floygan.
[255:02.19]No!
[255:02.51]I'm not playing Floygan Brothers.
[255:04.69]Okay.
[255:06.05]But thanks for the $5, though.
[255:07.55]Hey, Noodle is bad at gaming.
[255:08.59]Thanks for $2.50.
[255:09.32]Not gonna lie, I do the shit you said in the shower.
[255:12.34]Thank you.
[255:13.20]On a separate note, how do you feel about a stream where you hire an actual therapist and get group therapy for you and chat?
[255:20.65]I don't think I would want that.
[255:21.89]I don't think I want to go to a therapist on stream.
[255:25.21]Because I don't want to sit there and have them analyze me.
[255:28.55]And then it would be like, what if they come up with some fucked up shit?
[255:31.92]You know what I mean?
[255:32.50]Like, I don't want to do that.
[255:34.52]I feel like that would be out of my comfort zone, I think.
[255:43.18]What if they're like, let's talk about your childhood or something.
[255:45.49]And I'm just like, okay.
[255:47.61]How many people are watching?
[255:51.82]And SuperBruce, thanks for the five community subs as well as your bits.
[255:56.62]Thank you.
[255:59.12]Fucking egomaniac.
[256:00.20]You guys already know that.
[256:04.75]You guys already know this shit.
[256:12.01]Ego, ego, ego, ego.
[256:15.64]Fuck, I really am going to piss my pants.
[256:17.30]Can I go to the bathroom?
[256:18.92]I'll be right back.
[256:19.96]Let me just go pee.
[260:52.86]oh boy okay you know when you pee and you pee a full an entire piss you drain your bladder is completely drained and then four or five seconds go by and then I did your hair here you go again here comes again it's round two that happened like three times like I've I've pissed storage somewhere else where
[261:19.20]If you do a full piss, and then you do another full piss, where's that coming from?
[261:24.76]How many bladders do you have?
[261:25.70]Doesn't make any sense.
[261:27.39]The P comes from, okay.
[261:28.73]Yeah, I'm sure it does.
[261:32.07]I'm sure it does.
[261:32.73]Hey, Yenwen, thanks for the 250, Yenwen Len.
[261:36.77]I think we have a new finished picture.
[261:43.58]From my understanding, let's see.
[261:47.38]It says... This artwork I've done was probably the most difficult for me to complete.
[261:51.12]No matter what I was doing, my mind wasn't happy.
[261:55.20]Now, because of all the virus that's going around, all the schools are closed.
[261:57.56]That's right.
[261:58.54]I forgot about that.
[262:00.36]All the schools are closing and shit.
[262:03.42]This meant my training provider suspended me from teaching.
[262:05.96]I have a lot of free time now because of this, and I will admit being shut in all the time by the government is getting me down.
[262:13.68]Here is the artwork.
[262:17.11]It's fucking crazy.
[262:18.41]It's awesome.
[262:20.11]It's fucking unbelievable.
[262:26.85]Alright, solidified in history is an image.
[262:32.77]It's an image of me eating a rotten turkey sandwich.
[262:36.77]It's solidified in history now.
[262:42.73]It wasn't even rotten.
[262:43.55]It tasted fine.
[262:44.27]It just was probably bad.
[262:47.40]That's fucking incredible.
[262:49.04]As always.
[262:49.50]They all say, also I can confirm, when I draw you, I always initially draw your eyes too small.
[262:56.99]Your eyes are huge, dude.
[263:02.63]Are they?
[263:03.05]I don't, are they actually?
[263:05.31]They're not, though.
[263:07.43]Do I have big eyes?
[263:16.01]This is fucking fantastic, though.
[263:17.85]Like everything else you've done.
[263:21.47]It's 10 out of 10.
[263:23.65]Holy shit.
[263:25.88]Thank you again for this fucking ridiculous, incredibly detailed piece of artwork.
[263:33.74]Makes me want a turkey sandwich actually really bad.
[263:45.49]Frame it in your house.
[263:47.01]Imagine how much of a psycho I would be if I had just a bunch of framed paintings of me all over the whole house.
[263:54.29]That'd be scary.
[263:59.39]People would come over and be like, dude, are you like... You really like you, huh?
[264:06.74]Like, yeah, I like me.
[264:08.88]Look at me.
[264:09.48]Do you see me?
[264:10.90]We have a clip here.
[264:13.84]This is... Hold on.
[264:17.20]Hold on a second.
[264:20.10]This is, uh, Swiggity Swanky gave 250.
[264:23.22]They say flushed.
[264:25.26]Flushed.
[264:26.82]I don't know why they said flushed.
[264:28.38]We're about to find out.

[265:05.40]What was that?
[265:08.73]I don't even know what the context could be for that.
[265:11.81]I'm searching.

[265:56.29]It is.
[265:56.77]I've said that sometimes.
[265:58.79]That's a scary person.
[265:59.91]That's a person that, like, if you're on the subway and you look over, you're like, I'm moving five more seats to the right.

[266:58.18]What other image?
[266:59.94]There's two?
[267:00.38]Well, there was one underneath it.
[267:04.54]Oh, I didn't know there was two.
[267:08.85]But this is, this is just me opening my mouth.
[267:11.01]This is not even edited.
[267:12.26]This is just a, like, this is just my face.
[267:15.16]This is, that's an image of my face.
[267:19.94]It's not like smeared or like smudged.
[267:24.14]Or is it?
[267:26.65]It might be.
[267:27.89]Wait, is it?
[267:28.51]It's not?
[267:30.21]No, that's my face.
[267:31.29]It's not smudged or smeared.
[267:34.55]That's just my real face.
[267:36.11]It's okay.
[267:39.40]But thank you, Pluto, passing by for the 1500 bits.
[267:41.66]Appreciate that.
[267:42.21]$15 is a lot of money just to say pug.
[267:45.35]Thank you.
[267:47.67]Avery dropped dead thanks to the 530 bits.
[267:50.47]Hey, E-Clown, can you do an impression of a gorilla's character?
[267:53.77]There you go.
[267:55.57]There you go.
[267:56.47]Thank you.
[268:11.72]Uh, EmbeddedDan, thanks for the 300 bits.
[268:14.66]Thank you for the years of entertainment.
[268:15.68]In the past, in the past, I subbed seven months.
[268:18.80]Thanks, dude.
[268:19.38]Also played Resident Evil 4.
[268:25.94]I will.
[268:27.04]I will.
[268:28.10]Just not today and not tomorrow.
[268:30.34]Maybe someday soon.
[268:32.64]We still have to do No More Heroes 2 and both beautiful Joes.
[268:37.69]Those are very, very fantastic, incredible video games that I want to play, and we're going to play them.
[268:44.03]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the 1,500 bits, 15 bucks.
[268:46.70]You can't disagree with me on this because I'm right, but this is 100% a crack stream.
[268:52.20]They always happen during games that chat sees as boring.
[268:55.44]The other crack stream being Hidden Folk.
[268:58.20]Anyway, the worst hair bit made me cry, so thanks.
[269:03.28]Um...
[269:05.26]I disagree.
[269:07.12]I disagree.
[269:08.40]We had a very recent crack stream that had a very, very, very fast-paced, action-packed video game in the background that everybody wanted me to play.
[269:16.02]You know what it was?
[269:19.24]What was it?
[269:23.44]It was not Odama.
[269:29.12]Nope.
[269:30.90]It was Mario Sunshine.
[269:33.14]That's correct.
[269:35.88]At least one of those Mario Sunshine streams was a full-blown crack stream.
[269:41.48]And that was like two weeks ago.
[269:45.88]That was more meth-based.
[269:47.08]Did anybody hear that?
[269:49.24]Yes, because I opened my own stream because I wanted to see what games I played recently.
[269:53.40]I know there was a crack stream.
[269:54.44]It was Mario Sunshine.
[270:07.64]He's a ghost.
[270:09.10]It was the second one.
[270:09.96]It was the second Mario Sunshine stream.
[270:11.61]Yes.
[270:13.01]So it doesn't have to be a game.
[270:13.95]It doesn't matter what the game is.
[270:14.99]It depends on what the feel is.
[270:17.07]See, tomorrow when I play Ikaruga, that's a gamer stream.
[270:20.19]I'm going to play that game.
[270:21.18]I'm going to play it well.
[270:22.36]I'm going to do very well.
[270:24.18]So that one's going to be tomorrow.
[270:26.12]Little crack tomorrow.
[270:27.36]Just game.
[270:28.50]Gaming.
[270:33.03]But thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[270:34.39]Thank you, Boneless Bacon, for the 10 bucks thousand bits.

[270:45.86]Thanos beatbox.
[270:50.41]What is that?
[270:51.49]Anybody know what that is?
[270:56.01]I can't do it.
[270:57.01]I'm sorry.
[270:57.85]I can't do something I don't know how to do.
[271:00.37]But I really appreciate it.
[271:00.99]Thank you.
[271:04.53]-2 on that guy.
[271:06.63]What?
[271:09.99]Look it up.
[271:11.65]Thanos beatbox?
[271:13.41]Was it just, it's Thanos beatboxing?
[271:19.69]Thanos beatbox.
[271:20.87]Cartoon beatbox battles.
[271:24.59]Wait, what?
[271:26.50]Okay, this is a nose What are you doing what that was like pretty good the actual technique there was pretty good I

[272:29.93]It would be Kim.
[272:33.59]I mean, what do you want me to say here?
[272:35.84]Hey, Anarchy the OP, 300 bits, no message, just money.

[272:41.55]Man, thanks for another 500 bits.
[272:43.07]Jeremy, the wrestling company of AEW is making a wrestling game.
[272:45.69]Would you switch to that when it's released?
[272:48.51]If it has a better creative suite than the WWE games and has a good amount of features and can actually have a good rumble with more than five or six people in the ring at the same time and the computer can all play it.
[273:00.94]Yes, absolutely.
[273:02.46]Definitely.
[273:04.49]A Spaghetti Dude, thanks for the 10 bucks, thousand bits.

[273:15.54]Well, fuck.
[273:18.38]Let's show the... I'm gonna bump you in the face a little bit here.
[273:22.50]Sorry about that.
[273:24.49]Let's get the credits on the screen.
[273:26.89]All the subs from today.
[273:30.83]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[273:32.83]We'll be back tomorrow around the same time for Ikaruga.
[273:38.07]Thanks for the subs.
[273:42.69]Whether you subbed yesterday, whether you subbed today, or whether you subbed two years ago and never again.
[273:48.76]Or if you're not even subbed.
[273:51.08]It's all good.
[273:52.67]Thanks for even considering.
[273:53.53]Thanks for being the oil in the streamer car.
[274:01.90]Thank you.
[274:04.13]Well, it depends on how well Ikaruga goes tomorrow.
[274:05.89]Maybe.
[274:06.07]I don't know.
[274:06.45]Paper Mario?
[274:06.91]Probably... Yeah, probably.
[274:07.89]Maybe.
[274:08.01]Not immediately.
[274:09.05]Not for a while, though.
[274:28.79]Hey, Gold Ruby Production, thanks for the 250 bits.
[274:32.19]I enjoy tuning into the stream on a regular basis.
[274:34.91]But getting to watch on my birthday is even more special.
[274:37.51]Happy birthday, first and foremost.
[274:39.33]Thanks, Jerma and Chat.
[274:40.57]I hope some cake and ice cream is on its way.
[274:43.07]I hope it was.
[274:43.57]Hopefully you had a lot of it.
[274:46.47]Lots of ice cream.
[274:47.25]Two, three, four scoops of ice cream and two pieces of cake for this guy.
[274:53.35]Thanks for the 250.
[274:53.85]Appreciate it.
[274:56.26]Hope you had a good one.
[274:56.84]Happy birthday.
[275:00.08]silent serenity thanks for 250 do you think you'll ever play House Flipper again I re-watched those streams again and realized how super chill and fun they were love you Mr. Jerm if they add a significant update to it probably the last time I went back to it it was garden flipper if they add some more significant stuff to do that would last more than five six plus hours then yeah
[275:29.31]Absolutely, I love that game.
[275:30.55]I think it's a ton of fun.
[275:32.71]Just needs to be enough content for me to want to play it.
[275:34.29]Hey Reaper, thanks for the 250 bits.
[275:37.95]Nobody actually liked Bugleberry unironically, not even you.
[275:41.37]You only like him because the initial response was so negative that it was funny.
[275:46.54]No, I unironically like that character a lot.
[275:48.72]Just a lot of layers there, sorry.
[275:51.84]You misread me here a little, I think.
[275:57.16]Thank you, though.
[275:59.11]Thank you, Opster Narwhal, for the $3.09.
[276:03.73]When Bugleberry is around, you should... Bugleberry's a cool character.
[276:10.47]Bugleberry's a cool character, is what they said.
[276:12.58]Thank you, Opster Narwhal.
[276:14.96]Appreciate that.
[276:15.68]I also think he's a cool character, too.
[276:19.92]Both of you.
[276:20.46]Reaper, back-to-back, I think he's a cool character.
[276:25.28]Thanks a lot.
[276:27.03]Titan Claws, again, another 2,500 bits.
[276:29.79]25 bucks from Titan Claws.
[276:31.89]Thanks a lot, dude.
[276:33.29]Thanks again for the dope streams.
[276:34.69]I won't be able to watch for the next 10 months because I'm deploying.
[276:38.67]Yeah, same guy as before.
[276:41.09]Yep.
[276:43.07]Hope you're not playing such shitty games when I get back.
[276:45.85]Such shitty games.
[276:54.21]Stay safe.
[276:55.61]Good luck to you.
[276:58.52]We will absolutely welcome you back.
[277:03.96]Thank you for sticking around.
[277:06.32]Much love to you.
[277:08.41]When you get back, I am sad to say, though, you're probably going to tune in during, like, Blink the Cat.
[277:18.25]So I'm just going to give you some fair warning there.
[277:27.88]That game's good though, isn't it?
[277:28.78]Is that game any good?
[277:31.98]During Gex.
[277:35.44]Blinks the cat.
[277:36.32]Yeah, blinks the cat.
[277:40.15]I was hovering over the buy button on Amazon.
[277:43.07]And I was like, fuck, this game looks kind of like shit.
[277:46.09]But there's time travel.
[277:47.61]I don't know.
[277:48.83]I can't.
[277:49.37]I was thinking about it.
[277:53.38]But good luck to you, Titan Claws.
[277:57.48]I wish you the absolute best.
[278:00.88]Thank you so much for a huge amount of money.
[278:08.90]And then finally, we are going to end the stream here.
[278:12.67]We got one more.
[278:14.49]Let's do our proper The End.
[278:18.45]The second Blinks game is better.
[278:21.29]I didn't even know there were two.
[278:22.61]I thought it was just the one.
[278:25.32]Uh, DSGZ, thanks for the 500 bits.
[278:27.76]Jerma, love you lots.
[278:29.36]You've been making my day for as long as I can remember.
[278:32.00]And there hasn't been a time where I show up and don't laugh my ass off.
[278:36.93]Wish I could give you more, but this is all I got.
[278:40.03]Anyway, hopefully this pandemic ends soon, so you can take that chocolate factory tour.
[278:45.39]Here's a little something I made in anticipation of the occasion.
[278:53.55]Jeremy Alfredson in Jerma sewage factory.
[279:00.83]Oh, God.
[279:08.20]Let's hope so, too.
[279:08.80]Because not just... Not just for me to do a stream, like a comedy stream.
[279:17.39]More so, so the world can kind of get back to normal.
[279:19.35]I think that's more important.
[279:23.09]But thanks to the 500 bits, I look forward to it as well.
[279:28.63]Finally, Obster Narwhal, thanks for the 513 bits.
[279:31.45]Why did you make up something for my bit message?
[279:35.97]Why did I make up something?
[279:39.74]Um, I don't understand what you... I was under the assumption that a pre-stream chat was...
[279:50.84]You talk about things in pre-stream chat and don't spoil things.
[279:56.11]I thought we all had an agreement on these things.
[279:58.67]I guess not.
[280:00.15]Apparently not.
[280:04.79]I thought that was an agreed upon thing.
[280:09.95]But, z-z-z-zippin'.
[280:12.19]Zippin'.
[280:13.23]Shh.
[280:14.15]That's a Joker voice?
[280:15.37]Was it?
[280:15.95]No, it wasn't.
[280:16.47]That was a lean in, and, uh, that was... Oh, fuck, it is.
[280:20.31]Hey, Goobery Juice!
[280:21.45]Welcome back.
[280:21.89]You're not banned anymore.
[280:22.83]I unbanned you yesterday, if you didn't see.
[280:24.59]Maybe you didn't even see that whole thing, but thanks for the $2.50.
[280:29.46]Congratulations on being unbanned, you and Tar Alacrin.
[280:35.12]Gene Wilder or Johnny Depwanka?
[280:37.98]Uh, Gene Wilder a hundred times.
[280:40.83]Johnny Depp zero times.
[280:42.79]Okay?
[280:43.82]That's the easiest question I've had all day.
[280:46.48]Alright.
[280:47.32]I will see you guys tomorrow for Ikaruga.
[280:50.47]Good night.
[280:50.81]Take care of yourselves.
[280:53.05]Have a good one.
[280:54.77]And good night.
[280:56.57]Goodbye.
[281:09.20]Uh, Lokio250 just comes in right at the end and says, Jeremy, the Blinks game killed my cat in my mom's garden.
[281:14.35]Do not buy it.
[281:14.95]It's evil.
[281:17.13]Are you referencing what just happened at the end of the stream earlier?
[281:20.15]Is that what this is?
[281:20.65]I don't understand.
[281:21.73]Alright, goodnight.
[281:27.25]Goodnight.
[281:27.69]Bye.
[281:27.99]I think I'm still delayed.
[281:28.89]Yeah.
[281:29.45]Goodnight.
[281:30.03]Bye.
[281:30.23]There you go.
