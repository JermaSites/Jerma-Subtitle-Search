[00:33.48]What is happening?
[00:36.70]Hello, everybody.
[00:39.25]Hey, what is going on?
[00:40.93]Hey, happy Monday.
[00:45.67]Welcome back.
[00:53.29]Gonna be playing some video games today.
[00:58.55]With my good friend, Squeaks.
[01:06.64]Yeah, Squeaks and I, we got our Nintendo Switches synced up, linked up.
[01:12.53]We're going to be doing some Nintendo Switch.
[01:17.47]Mainly sports games.
[01:18.64]I think we're going to be doing some sports.
[01:19.82]Probably playing a little bit of golf.
[01:22.56]Probably playing a little bit of Yahtzee.
[01:28.45]Probably playing a little bit of tennis.
[01:32.86]Probably playing a little bit of that dogshit Twitch game that sucked.
[01:37.16]It wasn't even, not even remotely as good as Wii Sports.
[01:40.97]The dogshit one, you know the one?
[01:48.87]Maybe?
[01:51.00]Oh, we might just play one game for four hours.
[01:53.00]I have no idea.
[01:56.44]Let's get the ads out of the way.
[01:58.04]They should be starting any second here, hopefully.
[02:03.89]And we'll have an hour.
[02:06.28]Get rid of the pre-rolls.
[02:08.06]You know the drill.
[02:12.13]It's Ad Hell Monday.
[02:15.69]Yeah, guys, I'm thinking about trying a new thing here.
[02:18.86]Yeah, Ad Hell Monday, where it's this 20 minutes of ads an hour.
[02:24.65]And we laugh about it.
[02:25.79]And we laugh about it.
[02:29.65]We start laughing after the 15th ad in a row.
[02:33.09]We laugh.
[02:36.10]And I'm in there in the chat laughing with you, you know, typing like, what the hell?
[02:39.32]Like there's so many.
[02:45.49]Is this as a joke?
[02:46.48]Yeah, it would be as a joke.
[02:53.57]You should play Mario Golf.
[02:55.68]I have a confession to make, and I'll wait for Squeaks to be in the call before I get cut off by the ads.
[03:03.76]All the Nintendo sports games after 2010, I've not enjoyed any of them.
[03:09.81]Is that going to get me... Does anybody want to fight me now?
[03:16.70]I'll talk to him about this after the ad break.
[03:25.40]How could you enjoy them in the first place?
[03:28.48]That's a hot take.
[03:29.85]I think it actually is a hot take.
[03:30.89]By the way, where is... Yeah, Josh, you just put it up there.
[03:33.55]Where is Mario Baseball?
[03:35.99]Where is a new Mario Baseball?
[03:37.57]A good one.
[03:40.50]For the Switch.
[03:43.94]Those were great.
[03:45.20]Who wanted a fourth tennis game?
[03:48.16]I'm sorry.
[03:49.59]Let's apologize before anybody gets angry.
[03:51.87]Who wanted a third or fourth tennis game?
[03:54.41]We wanted Mario, Super Nintendo All-Stars, Mario and Bowser versus the SEGA Genesis All-Stars baseball game.
[04:11.72]Hey, Squeaks just canceled the collab after hearing your take.
[04:16.43]If you lose to Squeaks at all today, you have to take a shot from the lava lamp.
[04:20.21]Hey, lava lamp ain't even in frame today.
[04:22.84]I might not even turn it on because of that comment.
[04:39.07]How can we sound high-pitched today?
[04:40.25]We're not doing this every single time I turn the stream on, by the way.
[04:43.70]I'm not, you know, and I think people know it makes me annoyed.
[04:47.55]The last three streams, there's only two of you.
[04:51.21]Why am I even addressing it?
[04:52.61]I'm moving on.
[04:53.80]Forget everything I just said.
[04:56.84]Forget the whole thing.
[05:03.37]It's the Twitch high pitch.
[05:06.47]You're going to play the Number Factory game?
[05:08.62]I don't know.
[05:09.06]I don't know.
[05:15.93]Dude, you sound like Alvin.
[05:21.77]Why are you getting so defensive?
[05:26.00]I'm up here with a parry shield and I'm just... It's remarkable how good I am at parrying.
[05:40.82]Well, actually, no.
[05:41.38]I let the arrow hit me directly in the head.
[05:43.89]and then get angry at it.
[05:44.86]No, I'm not good at parrying at all.
[05:46.28]I'm, okay, I'm good at taking the arrow to the face, pulling it out, looking at the arrow, and screaming at it for five minutes, and then healing.
[05:54.92]So I'm good.
[06:03.35]You get it, you're engaged with counter attacks.
[06:12.24]You're going to finish the candle?
[06:14.57]Absolutely not.
[06:18.39]Absolutely not.
[06:23.04]What about Oblivion?
[06:24.82]Hey, all you Oblivion heads.
[06:27.42]Listen, I got something for you.
[06:32.05]The next two or three streams in a row after this, we're going full Oblivion.
[06:40.12]We're doing, and it's probably not going to be until a little bit later in the week, but I'm thinking like a Thursday, Friday, like a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or like a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Oblivion.
[06:51.91]Just play it, have fun, take time with it, pick some locks, you know, pick some locks.
[06:59.52]You know the deal.
[07:03.22]Alright, these ads haven't started yet, so I think whatever, they're just going to have to play.
[07:07.49]And we're good.
[07:09.78]Let's check in, see if Squeaks is here.
[07:21.49]Hello there!
[07:22.31]Is anybody there?
[07:29.80]Hello?
[07:31.50]Hi!
[07:32.42]You just scared me so bad.
[07:34.22]I did?
[07:35.38]What did I do?
[07:36.06]Yeah, just like relaxing music.
[07:37.54]I just hear this, this voice.
[07:41.57]What?
[07:41.89]I just said, hello.
[07:43.09]Yeah, but it was so, it just came from nowhere.
[07:46.22]It was like a deep, scary voice.
[07:48.86]Deep sca- What do you mean deep, scary voice?
[07:51.99]Well, it just, it just came from nowhere.
[07:53.33]It just went, hello there.
[07:57.01]Oh, well, you should have said deep, soothing voice.
[08:01.02]I mean, it was soothing.
[08:02.12]It was scary.
[08:02.71]It was just the context, Jeremiah, which is what really scared me.
[08:05.96]Okay.
[08:06.64]Okay.
[08:06.82]Well, hi.
[08:08.61]Hi.
[08:10.16]Are you ready for Sports Day?
[08:11.82]I'm ready for switch day.
[08:13.50]Um, by the way, I was gonna, I didn't bring this.
[08:15.42]Oh, what was that?
[08:16.19]What would I want to ask him?
[08:18.29]Oh, okay.
[08:19.05]I remember.
[08:20.27]Um, so the Nintendo games that have come out over the last 20 years.
[08:25.46]Yeah.
[08:25.68]Are, are you a, are you a switch?
[08:29.12]No, not a switch.
[08:30.27]Are you a Nintendo sports post 2010 hater?
[08:34.65]Or are you an, are you a Nintendo sports post 2010 fan?
[08:39.53]I'm a post-2010 Nintendo Switch hater.
[08:45.24]Good.
[08:45.56]But I'm at, like, the point where they're so bad that, like, I'm at the point where it's kind of fun that they're so bad.
[08:54.35]It's kind of like watching a really bad movie and then saying Chicken Jockey.
[08:58.35]You know what I mean?
[08:58.85]Right.
[08:59.48]And then messing up the movie theater with Popcorn.
[09:01.47]Just want to make sure you understand, I said chicken jockey in that tone, and I tried to pull it off.
[09:08.28]Didn't work.
[09:08.72]I did this two days ago.
[09:10.56]It was an embarrassment.
[09:12.48]You know what's so funny, Jerma?
[09:14.44]I was in your stream when you said chicken jockey.
[09:16.65]You were there?
[09:18.13]Once again, context.
[09:19.37]You just were off of an anecdote about how you don't trust public pools because you don't trust people wipe their asses.
[09:26.42]And then chat didn't respond, so then you said chicken jockey.
[09:30.81]So once again, it's about context, Jeremiah.
[09:34.40]Well, listen, how do you feel about that?
[09:37.88]About chicken jockey or people wiping their asses?
[09:40.93]No, about getting into a public pool where you don't know how many people live.
[09:43.99]You know, like you did like the scanning, like the scan thing pops up.
[09:48.28]And there's 15 people.
[09:50.16]Yeah, you do the terminating thing.
[09:51.28]There's 15 people in your frame and seven of them have not wiped their ass today.
[09:57.45]Or maybe they did, but not well, but not good enough.
[10:00.02]Jeremy, you know what the difference is between you and me?
[10:01.87]I just believe in the goodness of people wiping their asses.
[10:04.45]I guess I'm more of an optimist.
[10:06.79]Alright.
[10:07.21]Well, I don't know.
[10:09.04]OK, well, I just think people are cleaner and people, you know, by default want to see the goodness of all.
[10:15.43]And I believe that the world can be one beautiful, clean pool.
[10:18.91]I disagree.
[10:20.36]okay well then where do you draw the line like why even say the pool why not the world like maybe people are pooping their pants and the air is polluted like why even leave the house you know what I mean you need to have a air purifier going 24 7 you need to have clean a water filter coming in that's what I'm saying like where do we draw the line Jerma I'm sorry I draw the line where if I'm gonna gulp a mouthful of water that you in that's where I draw the line
[10:47.09]That's my line.
[10:47.99]Okay, that's fair.
[10:49.77]I mean, we just installed a bunch of games.
[10:51.39]How do you know it's not a frickin' virus?
[10:53.76]I'm just saying you can't live your life like this, Jerma.
[10:56.02]You're gonna frickin' drink poop water.
[10:58.06]No!
[10:58.86]No, I will not!
[10:59.74]Yes, you are!
[11:00.34]Yes, you are!
[11:01.25]The Nintendo Switch has a curation guy.
[11:04.89]There's a guy that sits there, and when a game comes in, he goes, and he runs malware bytes on it.
[11:12.46]And he goes, alright, that one works.
[11:14.32]I don't know what he does.
[11:15.04]He might do something like that.
[11:16.81]Have you ever scrolled through the recent releases in your Nintendo Switch?
[11:20.38]It's all inappropriate games.
[11:22.12]Yeah, that's kind of dumb shit.
[11:24.27]It's pretty bad.
[11:25.85]You think there's a guy sitting there with like a green and red button?
[11:29.34]Give me a break.
[11:29.73]Hey, that guy needs to stop pressing the button so much.
[11:32.39]Yeah, he's spamming.
[11:34.70]I mean, that guy shits in the pool for sure.
[11:36.68]At least.
[11:38.06]Yeah.
[11:38.56]Alright.
[11:38.88]What do you want to start with?
[11:40.39]There's 51 of these.
[11:41.77]We're playing that clubhouse games.
[11:43.01]51 clubhouse games.
[11:45.51]Yeah, let's play them all.
[11:47.84]There's half of these.
[11:48.62]I don't even know how to play.
[11:49.68]Do you know how to play half of these?
[11:52.87]No, I have no clue.
[11:54.35]Hey, let's skip to the good shit.
[11:55.87]Alright.
[11:56.21]Skip to the good shit.
[11:58.01]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[11:59.31]I actually have to put it on my screen.
[12:01.10]I don't even have my switch here.
[12:04.84]Well, okay, so are we just like breaking the sports?
[12:07.62]We're not doing sports.
[12:08.58]We can do any fun game.
[12:10.53]Yeah, I mean, I guess we could start with the golf one.
[12:13.33]No, I hate that.
[12:14.25]I hate golf.
[12:15.49]Anything but golf.
[12:16.17]You hate golf.
[12:18.22]You want to do like Connect Four?
[12:20.47]yeah that sounds good that's a good sport that's classic and that's a sport like chess is a sport this one here four in a row well it's four in a row don't use brand language please oh you're right alright so just uh we're gonna do it here we go okay good luck I know how to play this do you uh you know those are soft games
[12:43.57]There we go.
[12:45.30]Just skipped it.
[12:46.98]I'm sorry.
[12:48.10]I think I was coming through your... Did you hear that?
[12:50.55]You heard that a lot, didn't you?
[12:51.81]No, no, no.
[12:53.15]It was coming through my speaker because I have it in my speaker too.
[12:58.28]And then I had to turn it down.
[13:00.16]Okay.
[13:00.28]I'm just making sure that that was not my speaker coming through your speaker.
[13:03.37]Alright.
[13:04.35]I freaked out for a second.
[13:05.29]We just looped our speaker.
[13:07.55]We have the same ailment, whatever it is.
[13:10.71]Alright, I know how to play four in a row.
[13:13.49]We don't need the explainer.
[13:15.78]No, but you can explain it maybe for the chatters at home.
[13:19.06]Alright, so this is how it works.
[13:21.09]You go, I go.
[13:22.07]You go, I go.
[13:23.05]Get four.
[13:24.43]Don't shit in a pool.
[13:26.98]Well, I'm just saying, like, you know.
[13:29.12]I don't think the default mode is to shit in the pool.
[13:31.88]I'm yellow.
[13:33.41]Oh, is that your move?
[13:34.17]Yeah.
[13:36.73]Okay, wait, do you want to like make like a fun, like if someone loses, like what they have to do?
[13:42.06]You probably play this shit all the time.
[13:43.38]You probably know exactly.
[13:44.32]You probably have the calculation of, oh, he put it over in the right side.
[13:47.38]I'm going to put it in the middle.
[13:48.77]Ready, watch this.
[13:49.89]He probably just calculated everything that I'm going to do.
[13:52.05]No, I didn't.
[13:52.67]I'm just making it up.
[13:54.11]I just have like a fun idea.
[13:57.18]What if you lose for like three hours on stream one day?
[14:02.75]You have to wear like a red clown nose.
[14:05.31]No, I don't do this anymore because I lose every single time.
[14:08.29]I don't do these bets with anybody anymore because I don't think I've won a single one ever.
[14:12.68]What do you mean?
[14:13.48]Maybe it's a good thing, but you can never acknowledge that you're wearing a nose for the three hours and you never have to mention why you're wearing it.
[14:23.21]Okay.
[14:25.13]Let's see what he just did.
[14:27.05]Oh my God, dude.
[14:27.95]Wait, now I'm scared.
[14:30.64]Three in a row here.
[14:31.86]Oh boy.
[14:33.92]Wait, now I'm actually scared.
[14:37.23]Oh boy.
[14:37.93]He didn't even, he doesn't, he doesn't even understand the four.
[14:42.05]Wait, don't, are you?
[14:46.28]I play this game.
[14:47.54]I play this game like everybody else plays this game.
[14:50.20]You put them in random spots and who cares if you lose?
[14:55.28]Okay, you're acting like I know this game intimately.
[14:59.89]I do not.
[15:00.83]Oh, here we go.
[15:01.75]Nah, I'm joking.
[15:04.43]Boom.
[15:06.52]Yeah, give me a game where we fucking mash the button.
[15:10.18]No, no, no.
[15:11.00]Do it again.
[15:12.14]Do it again.
[15:14.50]I had no idea that was four in a row.
[15:15.89]I thought I was just blocking yours.
[15:17.49]I didn't either.
[15:18.95]Everyone's laughing at me.
[15:19.81]Stop laughing at me.
[15:21.63]Hey, come on.
[15:22.27]Don't laugh at him.
[15:25.05]I appreciate that.
[15:26.77]I got your back, man.
[15:27.85]Do I hit reset?
[15:30.20]Yeah.
[15:31.58]Oh, I just deleted your win.
[15:33.06]What?
[15:35.10]Oops.
[15:36.42]Alright.
[15:36.86]Let's have you go first because I feel like that's why.
[15:41.93]I feel like you knew what that reset did.
[15:44.03]Alright.
[15:44.91]Best two out of three.
[15:47.29]Okay, but that counted as one.
[15:48.70]Oh, yeah, and the loser has to stand up and put their hand up and punch themselves in the dick as hard as they can, right?
[15:55.23]No, no, no, no.
[15:56.37]Listen, we're just playing for fun, you know?
[15:57.81]We don't have to do any of this.
[15:59.16]Here we go.
[16:03.76]You all do this corner thing.
[16:05.24]I don't know.
[16:06.22]Yeah, it's to get the... No, I don't like when you do that.
[16:08.67]Where you build up.
[16:09.73]Don't build up.
[16:10.85]What do you mean?
[16:11.89]I don't like when you're doing a corner thing already.
[16:13.63]And now look, you've got the... I don't even like this game.
[16:15.81]This is like the vase.
[16:16.62]It's a vase strat.
[16:17.90]You haven't read the manual?
[16:20.60]You don't know like... I skipped the how to play.
[16:25.12]You can't get four that way.
[16:26.41]I don't know.
[16:29.33]I guess it's called zoning.
[16:33.03]I guess lost.
[16:35.76]I lost.
[16:36.32]Oh, yeah, you definitely did.
[16:39.22]Yeah, now you're in trouble.
[16:43.27]Why?
[16:43.37]Now you're actually in trouble.
[16:44.29]I'm actually nervous.
[16:45.35]No, no, no, I'm actually nervous.
[16:46.43]Hold on, let me just think.
[16:47.75]You breathe a little.
[16:50.00]Uh-huh.
[16:51.22]Okay.
[16:54.00]I like this music.
[16:56.01]Me too.
[16:56.61]It's like Mumford and Sons.

[18:14.24]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[18:16.46]They still make it on CDs.
[18:20.29]Jerma, I think I lose.
[18:21.63]I'm getting red in the face.
[18:24.41]I feel so embarrassed.
[18:25.43]I don't think you lost.
[18:26.35]People are making fun of me.
[18:30.96]They're making fun of both of us.
[18:32.63]Look, they're making fun of both of us together at the same time.
[18:34.73]Your chat is making fun of you.
[18:35.75]My chat's making fun of me.
[18:36.87]We cancel each other out.
[18:39.60]You know, I really needed to hear that.
[18:40.96]That makes me feel better.
[18:54.96]Oh, no, I wouldn't.
[19:01.14]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[19:03.56]I really fucked it up this time.
[19:05.58]Didn't I?
[19:07.12]I don't know the rest of the song.
[19:10.36]That's all I know, too.
[19:11.97]All I know, it was your heart on the line.
[19:17.07]That's it.
[19:17.95]And then the banjo comes in.
[19:23.22]Oh!
[19:25.46]You're still in trouble.
[19:27.56]Why?
[19:29.82]You just are.
[19:31.34]Go to your room.
[19:32.06]Like in the game?
[19:38.87]Hey, Jeremiah, do you still buy, like, um, plushies and stuff?
[19:43.02]Like, collectibles?
[19:44.98]I didn't mean that to sound mean.
[19:46.12]What are you talking about?
[19:46.92]What do you mean, do I still buy collectibles and plushies and stuff?
[19:50.68]What do you mean, do I still?
[19:52.51]When have you ever... When have you ever seen me with one of those?
[19:56.65]You and I have never seen each other in real life.
[19:59.07]Yes we have!
[20:00.11]Like four, like five times.
[20:01.59]Yeah.
[20:01.87]Yeah.
[20:02.33]You're actually one of the, you're like a creator.
[20:04.50]You're actually probably one of the creators I've seen the most.
[20:08.71]When have I ever had, what was I carrying, was I carrying around a plushie with me last time we hung out?
[20:14.07]What was it?
[20:15.03]I'm just making an assumption.
[20:16.73]I just feel like I have Yoshi plushies and stuff.
[20:20.80]It's cool.
[20:21.56]Do you see anything back here?
[20:23.60]I got... Wait, hold on.
[20:24.84]Listen, I feel like I hit a sore spot.
[20:26.30]It's cool to have plushies.
[20:27.75]I didn't mean to accuse you of anything.
[20:32.13]I feel like if I open a closet in your house, a million plushies are going to come out.
[20:35.52]Like a bowling ball and shit.
[20:36.72]It's like a bunch of fucking Sonic the Hedgehog plushies.
[20:39.96]Like, it's cool, Jeremiah, if you collect plushies, it's fine.
[20:42.25]Alright, I see what you're doing, because you know you're going to lose this next one right here.
[20:46.21]Oh yeah, for sure.
[20:50.00]So I guess the answer is yeah.
[20:50.98]Where are you trying to go?
[20:53.76]No, I don't collect, I don't collect plushies.
[21:00.97]See, well, hey, you know what?
[21:02.29]What I was, hey, from where I'm from, we call them stuffed animals, okay?
[21:07.58]From where I'm from, we call them stuffed animals.
[21:10.04]Right, right, sorry.
[21:10.68]I was just plushy shit.
[21:12.06]Plushy, no, it's a stuffed animal.
[21:15.03]Right.
[21:15.61]It doesn't matter if it's, it could be Luigi.
[21:17.45]That's a stuffed animal.
[21:19.35]Right, right.
[21:29.40]I think we both just have no idea what the hell we're doing.
[21:32.78]Actually, um... Or are you working on something that I can't see?
[21:37.41]No, no, no, no.
[21:38.05]You're good.
[21:39.35]Oh, my God.
[21:40.34]I actually... What the fuck?
[21:42.66]I didn't even... You were talking about fucking Luigi stuffed animals.
[21:46.37]You brought up Luigi.
[21:47.57]It's a plushie.
[21:48.47]Put down this one.
[21:48.89]You win.
[21:49.17]It's best two out of three.
[21:49.77]You won.
[21:50.15]Okay.
[21:50.51]Okay.
[21:51.43]Okay, so, like, you have to punch yourself in the dick.
[21:53.50]Oh!
[21:56.28]Come on!
[21:57.82]You tell me if you punch yourself in the penis, you go... Like you were Luigi?
[22:07.21]Alright, that one was fun.
[22:13.51]You want to play... We're supposed to play sports.
[22:17.30]Okay, we can change the sports.
[22:18.48]We just got distracted.
[22:20.48]Alright, one game of checkers and we'll do sports.
[22:25.01]Actually, I'm not...
[22:27.47]This is so embarrassing.
[22:30.13]Maybe I DM this?
[22:31.21]I'll just say it.
[22:31.77]I don't know how to play checkers.
[22:33.19]You don't know how to play checkers?
[22:35.53]No.
[22:36.01]It is... So you know when you open up Doom?
[22:39.66]Yeah.
[22:40.60]And you play Doom, and Doom has like the seven difficulties, and the first one is sweet.
[22:45.42]The second one is, oh, spicy.
[22:47.57]And then there's destructive, and then there's death.
[22:50.13]Yeah.
[22:51.05]So this is, if that was chess, this is the sweet version of Doom of chess.
[22:56.22]Oh, okay.
[22:57.14]I don't know how to play it.
[22:58.28]Yeah, that helps a lot.
[23:01.09]That's a verb.
[23:02.87]Have you actually never played this?
[23:04.81]I played it when I was like a little kid.
[23:06.36]It's fun.
[23:08.18]That was a long time ago for me.
[23:12.46]Alright, so you're red.
[23:13.79]I'm black.
[23:14.45]I'm red.
[23:15.11]Yeah, good luck.
[23:16.03]Okay.
[23:17.15]So all I remember is check.
[23:18.65]It tells you where you can move.
[23:19.61]You have to jump.
[23:21.30]Why would I tell you this?
[23:23.10]To capture a piece.
[23:25.58]Oh, okay.
[23:25.98]Yeah, yeah.
[23:26.30]I think I do remember.
[23:27.23]I don't want to tell you the rules of what a good strategy is because neither... I don't know either.
[23:31.57]And you just won the first one.
[23:35.09]Because we're keeping track.
[23:36.36]Okay, so you want to play like that.
[23:39.14]You don't want to tell me the rules of a strategy, okay?
[23:45.69]Oh, shit.
[23:46.23]That was so dumb.
[23:52.71]Okay, that's okay.
[23:53.31]This is like sweet mode.
[24:00.90]By the way, this is a sport.
[24:06.45]You have to move something eventually.
[24:09.49]I'm thinking.
[24:22.04]Where are you going to go now?
[24:24.34]Right here.
[24:26.27]Yeah.
[24:26.39]Where are you going to go now?
[24:31.68]uh right here right here we're gonna go now and you know I'm just probably just gonna go right here what about you right there oh alright alright uh how about right over here okay and what if I went right here
[24:59.49]That's an interesting move.
[25:01.42]Can't go backwards.
[25:02.88]He tried to go backwards.
[25:05.50]You don't know my brain.
[25:09.81]I did try to go backwards.
[25:13.23]Uh, okay.
[25:14.49]This is interesting.
[25:17.23]You play this so much, don't you?
[25:19.74]Not only get dumped, get double dumped or jumped, I mean.
[25:23.32]And King me, by the way.
[25:24.96]What is that?
[25:26.50]Oh, excuse me.
[25:27.32]You can move back.
[25:28.49]I don't know.
[25:31.22]Wait, so the, what do you mean you don't, so the king can go backwards now?
[25:33.88]I don't, where'd you hear that from?
[25:36.74]Because I just, what do you mean?
[25:38.07]I just hovered over your king and you can go backwards.
[25:40.19]I don't know what, that's, that's not canon rules.
[25:44.37]That's non-canon.
[25:46.39]That's non-canon, that's extended universe checkers rules?
[25:49.08]That's extended universe checkers, yeah.
[25:50.50]I'm not up to date.
[25:51.26]Okay, okay, okay.
[25:51.62]I haven't read the novel.
[25:53.02]Um, okay, uh, I don't know what to do.
[25:57.27]How about this?
[26:02.86]What are you going to do now?
[26:03.62]I don't know what to do.
[26:07.52]That was actually a smart thing.
[26:09.09]That was a smart thing to do.
[26:11.19]That was good checkers.
[26:12.55]Okay.
[26:15.23]Am I dead?
[26:15.82]Oh, that was dumb.
[26:23.33]I'll take the trade.
[26:26.15]Why do I feel like you played this so much?
[26:34.90]You can't move backwards.
[26:41.31]You can't move.
[26:42.55]No, no, that's that's if you have a move that you picked up your king, if you have a if you have a kill move, you have to take it.
[26:51.81]OK, OK.
[26:53.55]That's what I have to take it.
[26:55.27]I have to take this.
[26:57.79]Yeah, just because I touched the king.
[26:59.52]No, I put it back down really quick.
[27:03.90]no no no not my king oh the setup is real the setup is so real now oh what a setup it is destructive disgusting this is gonna be disgusting wait hold on there must be something I'm missing oh this is
[27:33.71]Good luck trying to get a king now.
[27:36.56]Absolutely destructive.
[27:38.64]Okay.
[27:39.52]I feel like you're missing one key move.
[27:43.70]What about this one?
[27:45.27]That's okay.
[27:51.89]Okay.
[27:53.35]You think you're smarter than me?
[27:55.56]What about this one?
[27:56.94]I think I'm Doom 64 spicy level easy smarter than you.
[28:02.67]You mean sweet.
[28:03.95]Let's play chess after this.
[28:07.60]Uh, sure.
[28:09.60]No, actually, I take that back.
[28:12.09]Do you know how to play chess?
[28:13.03]I'm terrible.
[28:13.89]I know how to play chess, but I'm so bad.
[28:18.74]You ever play Counter-Strike?
[28:21.98]Yeah, when I was 16.
[28:23.12]Alright, let's do that.
[28:26.33]Let's go.
[28:28.36]No, no, no.
[28:28.84]That's a lie.
[28:29.58]I pretended to be excited for CS:GO like 10 years ago.
[28:34.75]And you never played it?
[28:37.15]I mean, I played it for maybe three days.
[28:39.01]There's probably videos on my channel from 11 years ago.
[28:42.46]Me playing Counter-Strike and desperately trying to... Hey, look guys, I'm playing Counter-Strike now and it's a big deal.
[28:48.07]It's a huge new game.
[28:49.21]Anybody want to watch?
[28:50.31]Anybody want to watch this?
[28:51.89]And it got like 10% of my normal view count.
[28:55.90]Jeremy, you know I was a Counter-Strike streamer for six years?
[29:00.68]How about you and the Mario guy?
[29:02.52]I know.
[29:03.52]I had three viewers for six years, and then I switched to Mario.
[29:07.75]Oh, you were a Counter-Strike streamer?
[29:10.05]Yeah, but for three viewers.
[29:13.78]Wow.
[29:14.58]I didn't know that.
[29:15.42]I actually did not know that.
[29:17.24]Wow.
[29:17.98]So are you good?
[29:19.18]You must be good.
[29:20.16]Yeah, I am.
[29:20.81]I love Counter-Strike.
[29:24.94]Oh, no.
[29:27.78]Oh, it's heartbreaking.
[29:28.76]One, two, three, four, five.
[29:29.90]If you can... Now, if all of you guys back home, if you can count.
[29:34.43]Oh, no.
[29:35.91]So you're just... You're owning me.
[29:38.44]No, I would... Still, I could mess this whole thing up.
[29:40.64]Don't.
[29:42.30]You have to have more confidence in yourself.
[29:43.76]I think you can do it.
[29:44.51]Oh, I know I can do it.
[29:50.11]Okay, I wouldn't be that confident.
[29:52.30]I mean, after all, you have a plushie collection, so...
[29:56.19]It would have been a perfect opportunity for us to discuss this before, like a few days ago, and I just go get a shitload of stuffed animals, put them in the closet behind me, and then prove to you that there's not a bunch in there, and the actual, oh my god, look it all fell on the bowling ball thing happens.
[30:11.39]That would have been really funny.
[30:12.17]We gotta play something like that.
[30:18.02]Every single one of your moves has been calculated.
[30:21.66]My moves?
[30:22.85]Every move that you could possibly just do right there has been calculated.
[30:27.21]Yeah, of course.
[30:30.61]Oh, Jerma.
[30:31.97]You don't think I want you to take that?
[30:33.99]Big mistake.
[30:34.71]You don't think I want you to take that?
[30:36.54]Go ahead.
[30:36.74]Go get a king.
[30:37.16]I don't care.
[30:38.08]It's over for you.
[30:39.54]You have no move.
[30:40.80]Where are you going to go?
[30:41.36]Where are your moves?
[30:42.30]Besides that one right there.
[30:48.63]Where are you going to go?
[30:50.91]You can't go backwards.
[30:54.10]got no moves every time you bring up stuffed animals it screws everything up you actually may have just won the game I just don't understand your heart rate is clearly elevated I think I lost the game I lost the game I actually lost a completely innocent question I'm thinking about like funny routines to do and then I'm moving right now whatever I don't care I lose
[31:23.01]No, you don't.
[31:23.67]Come on.
[31:31.34]You're throwing right now?
[31:32.35]I stopped paying attention to the game five minutes ago.
[31:35.93]Okay.
[31:37.57]What can I do?
[31:37.93]Be nice.
[31:38.68]Be nice.
[31:39.06]You're not throwing.
[31:40.70]I can't even fucking do anything.
[31:41.76]You're just going to win now.
[31:42.58]I actually fucking threw.
[31:50.37]It's actually over.
[31:56.96]uh king me I got a good defense I guess wait how do so the king can go backwards that's the only difference it's the only difference backwards and forwards okay uh
[32:25.90]Come chase.
[32:26.79]That's fine.
[32:29.29]Oh, shit.
[32:29.73]Wait.
[32:30.01]I'm going to lose.
[32:33.56]Wait.
[32:33.78]I kind of have to rush forward.
[32:36.20]Right?
[32:37.36]Wait.
[32:37.58]Are we chased?
[32:38.40]Like, I can't catch up to you.
[32:40.09]How does this work?
[32:41.55]You could try.
[32:42.41]You can.
[32:42.93]No, I don't think I can.
[32:48.98]Because you're going to get two kings here.
[32:50.44]Are we going to have the exact same mirrored setup?
[32:53.31]What the hell is going on right now?
[32:56.04]actually think we are because if I move uh wait if I move here if I move to here you hop over wait this is insane what an insane game I don't know what happened I think I lose I don't know no no I think honestly we might have both we're both
[33:24.02]I don't think either one of us can make a right move.
[33:28.01]So we... Wow.
[33:36.40]Okay.
[33:38.74]Boom.
[33:40.06]King me.
[33:42.35]No, but now you can take... You can take this.
[33:46.93]Maybe.
[33:47.31]I don't know.
[33:49.08]Wait, no, you win?
[33:51.38]What do you mean?
[33:52.84]what do you mean you don't know hey don't open up that closet behind you have all those plushies fallout squeaks very sensitive about these plushies I mean I'd even bring up the luigi plushie that was completely brought on by yourself I don't know what oh you really want what's going on oh hold on thinking okay
[34:27.67]Can't do that.
[34:28.48]I hate that you can see me trying that.
[34:33.22]It's so humiliating.
[34:34.46]Okay, what if I do this?
[34:37.08]Problem.
[34:37.94]Oh my god.
[34:38.85]That is a big problem.
[34:42.43]I have thrown way easier things than this.
[34:46.53]Just to let you know.
[34:49.30]Oh no.
[34:50.96]No.
[34:52.10]My legacy.
[34:58.07]I mean, you could do the thing where you could build one half bullshit farm in Warcraft 3 in the corner of the map.
[35:04.92]Oh, yeah?
[35:05.74]The equivalent of, like, a proxy pylon.
[35:11.50]Okay, let's play Starcraft 2.
[35:12.47]That's a sport.
[35:13.13]It's an eSport.
[35:17.15]Jerma, you play any sports?
[35:19.84]In real life?
[35:21.24]Yeah.
[35:23.80]Yeah, I have.
[35:26.18]Like, which ones?
[35:27.19]Wait, I feel like I gotta hold on a second, because... I need to start to move shit.
[35:32.62]Wait.
[35:32.98]What do you mean?
[35:33.54]I'm just... Can I just get... Everybody just get... Can I get everybody king?
[35:36.65]Like, everybody become king?
[35:38.83]But then he's gonna have three kings, and I'm gonna have four kings.
[35:41.03]Who cares?
[35:42.35]We're gonna be... Just say pickleball, I guess.
[35:44.66]Message received.
[35:47.28]Pickleball and plushie guy, huh?
[35:53.19]Bro, you're gonna have five kings.
[35:56.89]Yeah, but I don't want to... All we're doing is swapping our starting zones, and we just have kings sitting at each other, looking at each other.
[36:07.53]It's like you're deciding on an apartment to buy.
[36:11.61]Just kill me.
[36:12.33]You got three kings, Jerma.
[36:14.88]Oh my god, I screwed up.
[36:16.52]Oh no.
[36:17.10]That was so bad.
[36:21.31]Wait, what?
[36:21.95]Gotcha.
[36:24.25]Why can't I go again?
[36:25.23]If I capture...
[36:26.78]because you can't you cannot kill anybody that's on the left or right side oh I didn't know that oh no and yes I'm using the word kill here not defeat okay sorry very harsh um alright I can I can still come back from this
[36:54.39]I gotta I gotta not this up hold on let me just you no you got this you got this wait what if I just sit in the corner you can and then we just I mean hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait like what would you do
[37:22.92]I'm just saying, you introduced this game as sweet mode in Doom.
[37:26.37]Every move you make is you lose, by the way.
[37:30.36]Every move I make, I lose?
[37:31.48]Every single move you make.
[37:37.71]Just give me enough time to get up there.
[37:39.09]That's what I'm looking for.
[37:40.07]Okay.
[37:41.44]Okay.
[37:50.88]This is the equivalent of building a farm.
[37:53.69]You're building one farm in the corner.
[37:55.19]I am.
[37:55.99]I am.
[37:56.89]I'm lifting my command base in Starcraft.
[37:59.59]Bring it on.
[38:01.80]What?
[38:01.98]I'm not going to... Obviously, I'm not going to concede.
[38:06.72]Concede.
[38:07.52]You need to concede.
[38:08.71]Yes, you have to.
[38:09.91]There's no button to concede.
[38:11.11]Look, there's no way you can win.
[38:12.11]Look at 1, 2, 3, 4 versus 1, 2.
[38:13.79]It's over.
[38:14.17]You have to concede.
[38:16.10]Once again, I'm an optimist.
[38:18.80]Two kings...
[38:20.55]At the end of the day, the king and the pawn go in the same box.
[38:25.24]So, imagine.
[38:26.92]You have to concede.
[38:28.36]I'm going to fight for my life.
[38:31.71]Am I going to checkmate you in checkers?
[38:33.73]Is that what we're doing?
[38:34.43]Do I have to checkmate you?
[38:37.80]We can see if you can pull it off.
[38:39.30]God damn it.
[38:40.54]Okay, hold on.
[38:46.11]It's a skill check.
[38:46.87]It's like Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls 1.
[38:58.32]Just like encroaching.
[39:03.74]There's a very threatening aura.
[39:08.97]How do I concede?
[39:09.89]Is there a concede button?
[39:12.25]You can play it out if you want.
[39:13.23]It's over.
[39:15.00]Okay.
[39:23.31]There's still a chance.
[39:32.10]Okay, I can do the same thing.
[39:33.34]No, but how do I actually beat you if you... Wait.
[39:42.15]No, you have to make a move here.
[39:43.27]Yep, it's over.
[39:44.07]GG.
[39:44.23]No.
[39:47.46]Okay, I'll concede.
[39:49.10]No, let me get the win.
[39:49.94]Let me get the W. Okay, I'll concede, man.
[39:52.70]GG.
[39:57.19]Nice, dude.
[39:57.85]And if you go back and forth from yours to the other, you get a triple king.
[40:06.02]I know what you're doing.
[40:07.90]What?
[40:08.24]I'm just moving around.
[40:15.47]Oh!
[40:16.73]No, actually, I fucked up big time.
[40:18.21]I fucked up big time.
[40:19.37]No, I thought you were going to concede.
[40:21.59]I fucked up huge.
[40:22.72]You never opinion upon.
[40:25.98]Hold on a second.
[40:27.04]You said you were conceding.
[40:28.92]At the end of the day, the plushies always end up in the same closet.
[40:32.55]Hold on a second.
[40:33.23]You have one king, I have two.
[40:35.01]I have to think about this for a second.
[40:36.25]That's unbelievable.
[40:38.77]Let me tell you, you never concede.
[40:40.43]You never concede.
[40:42.05]You always fight.
[40:44.19]Okay, now you lose.
[40:46.10]Oh my god damn it.
[40:47.78]Okay, hold on.
[40:50.74]I'm chasing around like a Scooby-Doo routine.
[40:53.37]You're the worst checker player alive.
[40:54.53]I'm opening a door, I'm showing up somewhere else.
[40:56.69]This is BM.
[40:57.13]If we were at the World Championship of Checkers, when I had those four there, a referee would have come over and he would have blown the whistle and gone, alright, get this guy out of here.
[41:06.56]This is BM.
[41:06.96]That's what would have happened at the World Championship.
[41:09.11]You're telling me I would have been escorted out of the building?
[41:10.91]I would have been respected for the play.
[41:13.17]They would have reviewed, they would have studied the play for years and years.
[41:15.77]I would change the checkers meta.
[41:17.80]They would never forfeit after this game.
[41:20.20]You could just run away forever.
[41:21.80]Never give up.
[41:22.78]Yes, exactly.
[41:23.78]It'll change the game.
[41:27.35]Never give up.
[41:28.19]Seriously.
[41:28.67]Someone in chat needs to hear that.
[41:31.47]Alright.
[41:31.69]Can somebody help me?
[41:32.70]How do I stop?
[41:34.94]Hey, mods, no backseating.
[41:38.18]There's a huge, there's a big rule, obviously.
[41:52.23]Careful.
[41:54.27]Yeah, but you're always gonna be able to... Okay, I know.
[41:56.80]I gotta zone the fuck out of you now.
[41:59.24]Now, you actually lose.
[42:00.92]God damn it.
[42:09.81]Who's your favorite king, Jerma?
[42:15.58]I hate this game!
[42:17.97]I was supposed to be out of this!
[42:21.46]never give up never surrender so what how does anybody ever win no I lose I lose no I don't you know this is gonna be the whole stream what are you doing it's gotta be a tie I think this ends in a tie no matter what no way hold on this is the art of war
[42:53.20]Dude, if there was an F6 right now, I stopped even paying attention to the game.
[42:58.06]We were talking about dinosaurs and if they were extinct or not.
[43:05.01]You had five kings?
[43:06.38]Yeah, and he ran way down to the bottom of the fucking screen.
[43:11.54]Alright, hold on.
[43:12.28]I need to fucking do some math.
[43:14.75]Alright, here we go.
[43:17.27]Here we go.
[43:41.12]Wait, if I go there, if I go up and you go to the left, you're dead.
[43:52.56]It's a stalemate.
[43:59.28]This is never going to end.
[44:01.44]The referee would have blown the whistle.
[44:02.81]The referee would have blown the whistle.
[44:04.47]Nobody can win.
[44:06.65]It's impossible.
[44:07.77]There's no winner.
[44:12.49]It's impossible for any of us to win.
[44:16.18]Hold on.
[44:19.88]The referee would have blown the whistle back when you were talking about whatever you were talking about.
[44:24.24]There's no winner.
[44:28.19]Now we have to do rock, paper, scissors to do this.
[44:31.01]You could have won.
[44:32.37]I won in my head.
[44:34.79]Well, in your head cannon?
[44:36.48]I thought we were saying that it's still me.
[44:38.40]Something's happening.
[44:40.30]Three-fold repetition.
[44:44.20]So we both have to punch ourselves in the dick.
[44:48.05]Great.
[44:48.93]Nobody would.
[44:49.31]I take that as a win.
[44:50.01]I take that as a win.
[44:51.14]I take that as a win.
[44:52.38]What do you mean?
[44:52.98]No, that's a win for me.
[44:53.98]You won.
[44:54.68]What do you mean?
[44:55.91]It was a comeback.
[44:57.37]I won.
[44:58.85]A referee would have walked in.
[44:59.79]A referee would have blown the kazoo and it would have been over.
[45:02.58]The referee would have had a tear of joy seeing how I never gave up.
[45:07.54]The audience would have applauded me, Jerma.
[45:10.11]What do you mean?
[45:10.81]Of course.
[45:12.15]I would have gotten screaming at the audience.
[45:15.35]I would have been screaming at the audience.
[45:17.17]No, no.
[45:17.83]The audience would have been screaming my name.
[45:19.66]They would have been so excited for me.
[45:21.02]It would be like, I would be... Let's play a game I'm good at.
[45:26.54]Oh, okay.
[45:26.86]Here we go.
[45:28.49]That was the biggest throw I've ever seen in my life.
[45:31.05]Right.
[45:31.99]It wasn't your fault.
[45:32.93]I don't know what I would do.
[45:34.75]I don't know how to play checkers.
[45:35.95]Whoever's closest to 21 without going over.
[45:37.95]So blackjack's a sport, right?
[45:39.18]We're doing a sports day.
[45:40.52]This all counts as sports.
[45:41.74]We don't play a single sport, by the way.
[45:45.38]Whoa, careful.
[45:45.98]You're going to get the blackjack and checkers community really mad.
[45:50.05]A lot of people are coming over from the Squeaks chat and they're saying, how did you lose?
[45:56.09]How did you lose?
[45:56.83]I didn't lose.
[45:58.09]It was a draw.
[45:59.16]My friend says it's time to stand.
[46:01.19]Hey, come on, Squeak Shatters.
[46:04.25]Not one person did that, by the way.
[46:09.04]Are you ready?
[46:09.70]Yep.
[46:10.40]You ready to do this?
[46:13.09]Yep, I'm ready.
[46:17.23]Good luck.
[46:18.07]Oh my god, we have CPUs.
[46:19.24]We've got to beat the CPUs.
[46:20.38]We have to get at least the first two.
[46:23.86]Communication error has occurred.
[46:25.41]What?
[46:26.75]Please try again later.
[46:29.74]So that means that I won in my head canon.
[46:33.12]Well, let's try this again.
[46:34.92]Okay.
[46:35.87]Okay, online.
[46:38.45]Mm-hmm.
[46:38.61]Play with friends.
[46:40.89]Create lobby.
[46:43.43]Okay, choose a lobby.
[46:47.70]Oh, you know the new Switch 2 is coming out soon, Jerma.
[46:52.10]New Mario Kart.
[46:53.22]It's going to be as much as a car.
[46:55.25]I don't know.
[46:58.01]Yeah, it's crazy.
[46:59.57]you get a pre-order no okay what do you think okay what what's different about it no do you know what no no no I've got a take for you alright let's hear it I would rather them just start naming consoles like madden
[47:22.07]The Nintendo 2025?
[47:23.97]Yes.
[47:25.05]Not where it was the Wii, then the Wii U, then the Switch, then the Switch 2.
[47:28.72]Just call it the Nintendo 2026.
[47:33.38]Ah, okay.
[47:34.19]So you can just keep track.
[47:35.51]But then it's like really bad because the Nintendo Switch came out like what year?
[47:41.34]Yeah, it'd be the Nintendo 2016.
[47:45.22]So we'd be playing the Nintendo 2016 in 2024.
[47:49.11]That's like when they came out with new Super Mario Bros and people still call it new Super Mario Bros like 20 years later.
[47:55.41]Yeah, but on the box, it would be Nintendo 2016.
[47:58.86]I see.
[48:01.46]And then people just call it the Nintendo 2016?
[48:04.66]It would be the Nintendo.
[48:06.81]It'd be like, oh, did you get the Nintendo?
[48:10.03]Dude, do you have a Nintendo?
[48:11.29]Well, fuck, which one?
[48:13.36]The Nintendo 2016.
[48:16.15]Is that the white one?
[48:17.27]Or is that the green one?
[48:18.44]Or wait, is that the one with discs?
[48:20.16]Oh no, that was Nintendo 2003.
[48:21.66]Yeah, you're right.
[48:24.92]I love how in your own fantasy conversation, there's confusion.
[48:29.91]Like you could have made a scenario where there is no confusion.
[48:32.27]Oh, 50?
[48:33.91]Let's go.
[48:34.95]50.
[48:36.18]I'm going to do 51.
[48:38.38]Oh, excuse me.
[48:39.06]Oh, a 13 in this bet.
[48:41.98]Oh.
[48:45.36]Something low.
[48:45.80]Something low.
[48:47.31]Oh, boy.
[48:49.13]Oh, and they have a nine.
[48:52.35]Do I hit with a 15?
[48:54.96]The book says yes.
[48:58.66]Oh.
[48:59.88]The book says yes again.
[49:00.91]At this point, it's up to you.
[49:03.09]I stand.
[49:03.49]I stand.
[49:06.21]Well, that sucks.
[49:13.48]What?
[49:15.20]Alright, now I'm winning.
[49:16.60]I'm beating you by $1.
[49:17.94]By $1.
[49:20.21]Well, now I'm going to bet one under you.
[49:25.11]Dang it.
[49:25.79]You're going all in?
[49:26.81]Hey, sometimes you got to fucking... Sometimes you got to take a little bit of risk.
[49:31.30]Okay, I see.
[49:32.78]I'm going to go 41.
[49:35.29]So I have eight.
[49:38.33]Oh, that's... Hit.
[49:44.20]Hit.
[49:46.37]I'm gonna stand.
[49:47.23]Don't stand on a six.
[49:50.05]Are you crazy?
[49:50.73]Why?
[49:51.53]Why?
[49:52.01]Then I win.
[49:52.55]No, you don't.
[49:54.02]He can take... Oh, you're talking about the standing.
[49:57.46]I get it.
[49:59.62]Oh.
[50:00.51]Boom.
[50:02.63]This guy stands on a 16 and still... This is where I would take a huge haul of my cigar.
[50:07.27]I would drain it down to the fucking filter.
[50:10.00]And I would just be like... And I would put gas out and then I would get up and leave.
[50:16.72]You would do the whole, you'd just show the entire party.
[50:19.71]I can go negative.
[50:20.95]What is that?
[50:21.91]You can go negative in a Nintendo Switch game?
[50:24.57]Do you think that's like irresponsible?
[50:28.18]Actually, kind of.
[50:29.94]That's insane.
[50:30.84]Alright.
[50:32.44]Let's see what you got.
[50:33.10]Don't give me this.
[50:33.98]Don't give me this.
[50:34.52]But wait, actually.
[50:35.62]Yeah, right.
[50:38.63]Double down.
[50:39.19]You can double down?
[50:40.23]What?
[50:40.91]I can double down with negative 200?
[50:42.65]What are you doing?
[50:44.45]Wait, can you just go negative a thousand or something?
[50:46.27]I don't know.
[50:47.03]But if I win this, then I actually... Am I... Do I get my... Wait, this is crazy.
[50:53.86]Oh, no.
[50:55.04]What do you mean, uh-oh, negative 200?
[51:00.81]What the fuck, you, man?
[51:02.27]I'm back down to negative.
[51:04.75]I'm back to zero.
[51:05.43]We're looking at computers, Jeremiah.
[51:07.39]This is humiliating.
[51:08.78]There is no... It's just the cards that come out of the machine.
[51:13.34]Yeah, but, I mean...
[51:14.74]We should at least have some sort of, you know, human... CPU 2 is going to lose.
[51:21.69]Are you able to bet?
[51:23.91]Yeah, it says you're in control.
[51:25.84]Wait, I can't bet.
[51:26.90]Yeah, I can.
[51:29.00]Okay, good.
[51:32.73]Oh, let's freaking go.
[51:33.87]I'm getting 14, 14, 15, 14, 14.
[51:36.31]Oh, here we go.
[51:41.52]This sucks so bad.
[51:42.42]Two sucks.
[51:43.24]And I hate that.
[51:43.76]I hate that I have to do this.
[51:45.11]I hate that I have to do this.
[51:47.71]I hate it.
[51:49.41]You're going to stand?
[51:50.19]I hate it.
[51:51.57]Hit, hit, hit, hit.
[51:53.04]I can't.
[51:53.82]Come on.
[51:55.16]Come on.
[51:57.36]You piece of shit.
[51:58.20]I was going to stand.
[51:59.16]Well, it didn't matter anyways.
[52:06.07]Oh, damn.
[52:06.27]Actually.
[52:06.61]I mean, come on.
[52:07.88]No, it didn't matter anyways.
[52:09.56]I just fucked the whole table.
[52:13.63]This is the worst table ever.
[52:15.22]We're going to get so unlucky.
[52:16.38]The comeback rider.
[52:21.54]Okay, you're going 100.
[52:22.58]I guess I should bet like... I want to bet a lot.
[52:26.55]Oh, this is the last round.
[52:27.59]Yeah, look.
[52:30.45]Bottom right.
[52:30.97]Five out of five.
[52:32.58]Oh, that's big.
[52:35.00]Alright.
[52:38.30]Stand.
[52:39.30]19.
[52:40.04]Oh, shit.
[52:42.85]10.
[52:42.99]I should hit.
[52:44.63]Oh, if he flips over at 20, I'm going to be real mad.
[52:48.02]Oh, my God.
[52:52.94]This dealer is insane.
[52:58.35]Alright.
[53:00.99]I'll take third.
[53:01.83]We lost the computers.
[53:05.54]That's the kind of score you get if your controller gets unplugged in the middle of the game.
[53:11.38]Wait, how did that?
[53:12.58]That was just unlucky.
[53:13.72]That wasn't your fault.
[53:15.53]Obviously.
[53:16.03]But you're good at blackjack.
[53:19.35]We're doing this one.
[53:19.91]Are we doing another one?
[53:21.47]Yeah.
[53:24.54]I thought you played blackjack.
[53:25.84]Yeah, it's called a three, a six, a four, a three.
[53:30.82]I can't control what cards come out of there.
[53:33.47]Yeah, it's just unlucky.
[53:36.01]Alright, I'm going to be conservative.
[53:39.25]I'm going all in.
[53:40.52]Why does my hair look like a dried rat carcass?
[53:42.39]Ban that person for a year.
[53:45.41]I hate this game.
[53:46.81]Are you going to be fucking kidding me?
[53:51.20]How do you have 21?
[53:52.20]I got five.
[53:54.37]Are you serious?
[53:57.29]I bet 10 chips.
[53:58.25]Oh.
[54:00.78]And now you're going to get 21.
[54:01.88]No.
[54:03.12]Oh, no.
[54:08.01]Oh no.
[54:09.42]Now you're in my position.
[54:10.40]Now you're screwed.
[54:13.50]Oh no, I should have stood.
[54:16.16]That's so sad.
[54:17.46]CPU 2 is insane.
[54:24.53]I'm going to clean out CPU 2 right now.
[54:29.28]Are you supposed to stand on 15?
[54:31.02]What's the rules?
[54:32.60]It depends on what card is showing.
[54:36.53]Do you play poker?
[54:38.22]No, it scares the shit.
[54:39.14]I'm afraid of getting followed into the parking lot.
[54:42.13]Oh, yeah?
[54:42.73]You're that good?
[54:43.75]No, I just, I don't know.
[54:44.61]I always feel like if I play poker at a casino or something, it's going to be like, Oh, yeah!
[54:49.34]Oh, no, I got a full house!
[54:50.86]Oh, woohoo!
[54:52.28]Yeah!
[54:52.72]I'll take all those chips!
[54:54.90]And there's like just five people just sitting there like, The fuck did you just take?
[54:58.83]I don't know.
[55:00.19]It scares me.
[55:01.13]I don't know.
[55:01.47]I don't like playing against the house.
[55:03.02]I don't like playing against other people.
[55:04.80]That freaks me out.
[55:06.78]Or they'll be like, oh my God, Jerma, minus 200.
[55:09.30]Are you okay?
[55:13.23]Do you want us to spend time with you?
[55:17.23]Are you hiding your hairline with your bangs?
[55:19.21]Who are you?
[55:19.87]What are you talking about?
[55:22.28]It's because I've been really struggling with my hairline recently.
[55:25.60]Your hairline is fine.
[55:30.19]What are these people talking about?
[55:31.66]Like, fine as in thin?
[55:32.94]Or... No, it looks good!
[55:34.57]Somebody said, Squeaks, you're bald.
[55:39.91]Squeaks is... No, he's not!
[55:42.07]Listen, it's... It's alright.
[55:43.52]It's just been... It's been a couple years.
[55:46.00]Like, six, seven years.
[55:47.06]It's been receding.
[55:48.48]It's been speedrunning up.
[55:52.43]Jeez.
[55:54.03]I know.
[55:55.23]It's... It's rough out there.
[55:56.61]I got, like, a good two or three years.
[55:58.71]And then it's gonna be... See you later.
[56:01.26]And I said, you're both beautiful and radiant.
[56:03.71]Hey, thank you.
[56:06.19]We are.
[56:06.63]Oh, you got a blackjack.
[56:10.48]Hey, hey, hey.
[56:11.40]Hey, what's up, man?
[56:13.92]If you're sitting right there, if we're at a casino in real life and you're sitting right here to my left, I'm going to give you, I'm going to nudge you like, I'm going to, hey, blackjack, look at this guy right here.
[56:23.31]I'm going to whack you in the chair, like right here.
[56:25.68]Like, hey, look at this guy.
[56:27.80]And then I'd smile and take a sip out of my gin and tonic.
[56:31.28]You know what I mean?
[56:35.31]You there?
[56:39.59]You like gin and tonic?
[56:41.29]Ew.
[56:42.69]What?
[56:43.38]Gin and tonic tastes like pine salt.
[56:46.32]I just like how it makes me feel.
[56:48.82]Like with the, you know, all the stuff, the lime and stuff in it, I just like it.
[56:54.69]Folding it with a little straw, I just like it.
[56:57.75]You ever have a bush light in your life?
[57:01.32]You know what?
[57:02.06]I have.
[57:03.12]And, uh, I think it's alright.
[57:06.79]Like, it's fine.
[57:07.67]It's good.
[57:09.03]Oh, we're waiting for you.
[57:11.27]Oh.
[57:13.52]Oh, what?
[57:14.02]It doesn't auto-stand when I hit 21?
[57:17.68]I stood.
[57:18.46]I stood.
[57:19.77]Wait, do you like Bush Light over, like, Mikolov Ultra?
[57:22.75]Uh, I think All Beer is not good.
[57:25.23]Okay, I actually agree with you.
[57:28.96]But you know what's really good?
[57:30.19]White Claw.
[57:31.37]I think White Claw is the end game of alcohol.
[57:34.40]It's... I don't know.
[57:36.11]It tastes like...
[57:38.88]I don't mind it.
[57:40.59]It's okay.
[57:41.75]But it tastes like... It's just like this fizzy... Like I can taste it in my nose.
[57:49.88]When I take a sip of White Claw, like I taste it through my membranes in my nose, not in my mouth.
[57:54.74]I don't get it.
[57:55.36]I don't know why.
[57:55.96]Your nose in there?
[57:56.71]Like, what do you mean?
[57:58.09]I taste it through the membranes in my like eyes.
[58:02.88]Because it's, like, so intensely flavored.
[58:05.45]I like that about it.
[58:06.25]It's like a Jolly Rancher.
[58:07.21]That's so good.
[58:08.08]It's like candy.
[58:09.86]That's what I like about it.
[58:10.97]Like, I feel like some drinks are so muted.
[58:14.08]Ugh.
[58:14.84]Yuck.
[58:15.74]It's like an insecure drink.
[58:17.11]I like one that's like, boom.
[58:18.69]I'm a freaking cherry.
[58:20.17]Hey, right now I look over at you and I go, oh, nice 20.
[58:24.78]You've been getting that all night.
[58:26.30]I wish I was in that chair.
[58:28.20]I wish I was in that chair.
[58:29.38]Oh, you put the good chair.
[58:30.73]And I take a freaking big draw from it.
[58:33.99]And then I go, huh?
[58:34.79]85?
[58:35.69]You still sitting here?
[58:37.36]They let you here on this table?
[58:39.60]Yep.
[58:40.56]Yeah, and that's fine.
[58:41.60]And I would give it to you.
[58:42.32]I would let you take a sip out of the cigar.
[58:44.28]That's fine.
[58:45.79]Alright, good.
[58:47.51]Boom.
[58:49.18]Ooh, this is a big deal.
[58:50.92]Big deal coming up.
[58:54.10]Alright.
[58:54.68]I'll go negative for this one.
[58:55.66]Give me 10.
[59:00.73]Oh.
[59:01.03]Hey, somebody's in the hot seat.
[59:07.47]Let's go.
[59:07.97]Good.
[59:08.42]Alright, that's the last round.
[59:10.80]And I just won.
[59:13.20]Oh, my God, you did.
[59:14.26]That's a GG right there.
[59:16.02]Wait, that's insane.
[59:17.48]On that last bet.
[59:19.82]Shoot.
[59:20.44]I didn't even realize.
[59:23.34]Dang it.
[59:23.92]It's all that fricking gin and tonic talk.
[59:26.11]I got excited.
[59:26.99]Can I ask you a very, very personal question?
[59:32.19]Absolutely.
[59:33.63]What is it about gin that you like?
[59:36.28]And I need it explained in three distinct points.
[59:40.46]Okay, wait, can I have like a very personal answer?
[59:42.50]Sure.

[60:20.21]Okay.
[60:21.85]Oh, this actually looks kind of fun.
[60:25.52]Yeah, it's like the Wii, except we don't have to wave our hands.
[60:30.00]We haven't gone past one game, by the way.
[60:33.25]No, we haven't.
[60:36.25]Alright, long stream.
[60:37.35]I'm in.

[60:47.86]Boom.
[60:49.20]Boom.
[60:50.35]What the fuck just happened?
[60:52.29]Wait, we played tennis in real life.
[60:54.15]During the, um, shuffle-a-thon.
[60:56.43]Oh, it's the, ah, the game.
[60:57.87]That's right, this is my game.
[61:00.58]Boom.
[61:03.16]It's, okay, it's the B and the A, the left and the right, it's freaking me out.
[61:07.44]That's alright.
[61:11.78]It's freaking me out.
[61:12.80]It's two different buttons.
[61:15.28]I've played this before.
[61:16.08]I've actually played this a lot.
[61:18.39]You've played this?
[61:20.17]Yeah, yeah.
[61:21.23]For like four hours.
[61:22.35]One flight.
[61:23.36]I don't know why.
[61:27.44]I don't know why.
[61:27.96]I just played this one specifically.
[61:29.97]Like a ton.
[61:33.37]Alright, I'm taking a break.
[61:34.31]I'll be back in two and a half minutes.
[61:36.15]Okay, me too.
[61:39.25]I didn't know.
[61:40.17]What am I supposed to do?
[61:41.54]It's you.
[61:42.64]I can't explain it.
[61:45.90]Me too.
[61:46.48]Alright.
[61:51.03]See you guys in the next video.
[61:53.16]Yeah, I could hear him laughing.
[61:54.14]He's laughing at me.
[66:46.46]So, uh, headphones.
[66:50.59]Yeah, yes.
[66:52.19]Do you think that right and left should be, instead of having a tiny little etch on it that says R or L that you have to have a fucking microscope to see it, do you think it should be color-coded?
[67:07.96]That's a great idea, but I also think it should be etched R and L so you can just feel the R and L. That's a great idea.
[67:16.19]R could be red and L could be blue, and they should be etched out.
[67:20.61]Boom.
[67:21.87]I actually think that's a great idea.
[67:23.77]I think we could really change the world with some of our ideas.
[67:26.35]What the hell just happened?
[67:28.10]Boom.
[67:28.46]Wait, how are you doing that?
[67:30.90]It's timing-based.
[67:32.48]Oh my god.
[67:34.46]Whoa, you're moving forward?
[67:37.66]Wait, what?
[67:38.64]You are playing totally different.
[67:41.72]Did you like look up some guides in the bathroom?
[67:43.63]No, I just got an extra, I got a little bit more coffee.
[67:47.19]Okay.
[67:51.60]Uh, what kind of coffee do you drink?
[67:56.22]Shit.
[67:57.48]Damn it!
[67:59.09]Uh, I drink, uh, I like Pete's coffee.
[68:03.09]Ah, so you go, you get it?
[68:06.31]I thought you were going to.
[68:08.52]I'm trying to distract you.
[68:09.66]Are you a Pete's fan?
[68:12.40]Well, I just do instant coffee.
[68:15.35]Okay.
[68:16.83]I just got, like, that powder.
[68:18.54]And then, like, I have that electric kettle.
[68:24.45]Just warm it up.
[68:25.72]How am I getting owned?
[68:27.22]I'm trying to distract you and it's backfiring.
[68:29.66]It's a tie game.
[68:30.54]What do you mean getting owned?
[68:32.35]I've sacrificed like so many hours of my life to stuff like this.
[68:39.73]Well, uh... Sorry.
[68:45.36]Just trying to blow me out like a candle.
[68:47.58]What was that?
[68:49.58]That was, uh...
[68:53.63]Why did I do that?
[68:54.75]I did the B goes left, A is right.
[68:57.20]People that have never played this before, you don't get it.
[68:59.24]Shut the fuck up.
[69:04.11]Oh my god.
[69:07.29]Okay, what are we risking?
[69:10.54]Uh, getting a Luigi plush that you have behind you at all times.
[69:17.45]Forever?
[69:17.87]For the rest of our lives?
[69:18.75]Okay, deal.
[69:19.23]It's the left and right shit.
[69:28.92]Oh, no, no, no.
[69:35.99]Oh, my game's frozen.
[69:44.74]Best of three, obviously.
[69:46.12]Okay, that's fine.
[69:50.39]Alright.
[69:50.61]I'm telling you, something is different.
[69:53.37]The coffee changed your gameplay that much.
[69:58.08]Find out.
[69:59.86]Oh, it's iced coffee.
[70:00.91]That's a huge detail.
[70:02.03]Ooh, iced coffee.
[70:04.13]Iced coffee is the only way.
[70:05.87]You're East Coast, right?
[70:08.17]Yeah, New York City.
[70:09.63]So you understand that iced coffee just doesn't matter.
[70:12.86]It's always iced coffee.
[70:16.02]What does that mean?
[70:17.08]It could be two degrees outside and it's iced coffee.
[70:21.61]Yeah.
[70:22.49]Yeah.
[70:23.33]Wait, explain what that means.
[70:25.35]that you will drink an iced coffee even if it's like negative five degrees.
[70:29.73]Oh, of course.
[70:30.99]Of course.
[70:31.75]Yeah, a lot of people think that is crazy.
[70:33.08]I think that's an East Coast thing.
[70:34.62]I'm going to say something controversial.
[70:36.08]Go ahead.
[70:36.72]I don't like cold brew.
[70:38.18]That's fine.
[70:40.16]Good.
[70:40.82]Maybe that's an East Coast thing too.
[70:42.31]I hate when a place just has cold brew and doesn't have iced coffee.
[70:46.23]Like it's totally different.
[70:49.11]Oh my God.
[70:50.76]You're bringing up coffee and now I'm getting self-conscious.
[70:59.32]How are you so good?
[71:02.26]Okay.
[71:02.64]Hold on.
[71:03.88]Alright.
[71:04.10]You can set up if you want.
[71:05.88]Okay.
[71:06.00]Hold on.
[71:06.22]Let me just... Okay.
[71:09.37]I promise I win this one.
[71:11.55]Cold brew?
[71:13.33]It tastes a little syrupy.
[71:16.67]It's a little too... It's thicker somehow, right?
[71:21.76]Best of five.
[71:22.36]Best of five.
[71:23.14]I want to see that Luigi plush.
[71:27.38]I don't have a Luigi plush.
[71:30.21]I have a Mario riding a Yoshi plushie.
[71:32.94]Oh, that counts.
[71:33.44]That's fine.
[71:34.96]You want to see it right now?
[71:36.26]No, no, no.
[71:36.72]That counts.
[71:37.22]That works.
[71:37.73]You can just take Luigi off Yoshi.
[71:41.03]You got a sewing kit, don't you?
[71:43.39]No, I don't have a sewing kit.
[71:45.14]I'm not into sewing.
[71:48.20]You mean like for the rest of my life, for the whole time, I have to have this stupid plushie.
[71:53.83]Wait, we have to play that again.
[71:55.05]One more time.
[71:56.65]That was by one, two out of three.
[72:00.37]I'm gonna look that's gonna haunt me forever.
[72:02.99]Alright, well then I'll just do we'll do three out of four and then I want you to 3D print that fucking Luigi.
[72:10.92]Why are you so good at this?
[72:12.18]I actually don't get it.
[72:12.98]It's amazing.
[72:17.55]It's you moving up.
[72:24.46]One of us is gonna croak eventually.
[72:29.22]OK, OK, I'm ready.
[72:31.77]Oh, I'm sorry, you asked me about gin and tonic.
[72:34.06]I don't think I ever answered your question.
[72:36.62]No, yeah, I wanted three bullet points as to why you think that gin and tonic is something that anybody should ever put into their stomach.
[72:42.39]Wait, what do you not like about it?
[72:43.91]It just tastes like pine trees.
[72:47.66]Yeah, but with alcohol, I actually, like, a lot of it is just how I think I look holding the cup.
[72:57.43]Stop!
[72:58.79]2015.
[72:58.91]2015.
[72:59.53]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[73:02.54]You're a glass swirling Andy?
[73:04.34]Is that what I'm hearing?
[73:05.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:06.35]Exactly.
[73:07.17]Like, sometimes, like, I like to just hold the cup and, like, I'll pretend like I look like Don Draper or something.
[73:15.31]Do you want to make sure you have ice in it so it goes...
[73:19.56]exactly exactly and then like I'll use like I'm not even kidding you Jerma like if I'm talking to someone and we're drinking alcohol I'll like pause in the middle of my sentence to drink as like a power move that's cool that's fine see isn't it cool and if there's ice in it like it just adds to the tension well okay by the way are you are you uh Two Fingers Three Fingers four fingers what do you what do you do
[73:45.43]Well, it depends.
[73:46.01]Like, if it's like, um, if it's a gin and tonic, I'm like Three Fingers at the top.
[73:50.98]Okay.
[73:51.16]So, so you, okay.
[73:52.38]So yeah, I'm, I'm, I, I, Two Fingers.
[73:54.57]Two Fingers of whiskey.
[73:55.73]Two Fingers of whiskey.
[73:56.87]That's irresponsible.
[73:57.93]Two Fingers is nothing.
[73:59.03]Two Fingers is like a, it's, that's like the way it should be done.
[74:03.20]Whoever's doing four fingers of whiskey, fucking slow down.
[74:05.73]That's too much.
[74:06.33]Okay.
[74:09.33]Two Fingers.
[74:09.95]Okay.
[74:10.68]You ever have somebody order five fingers of whiskey?
[74:12.96]It's like the whole glass.
[74:16.82]Give me a freaking solo cup.
[74:19.00]Oh my god, wait, I love this.
[74:20.53]This is going to be so good.
[74:22.65]Soccer.
[74:23.25]Wait, we're back to sports.
[74:25.23]Yeah, we're still doing sports.
[74:27.15]We're good.
[74:27.53]We've been doing sports from the beginning.
[74:29.23]Yeah, we're good.
[74:32.00]I'm not going to lie, I'm already like sweating.
[74:34.08]I am too.
[74:35.80]Okay, good.
[74:36.36]Alright, hold on a second.
[74:37.98]It's moving.
[74:47.52]Yes!
[74:49.66]Yes!
[74:49.96]You just press buttons like everybody else does.
[74:51.60]No, I'm not.
[74:52.22]I'm actually being so tactical.
[74:54.14]You know, I've played soccer my entire life.
[75:00.81]This is just what it looks like when bugs fight each other.
[75:03.07]This is like an anthill war.
[75:05.74]Here we go.
[75:08.10]We're... I'm... What is it?
[75:13.19]What do people say when Ronaldo scores?
[75:14.71]They go, sui...
[75:16.56]I've never watched a single minute of soccer on television in my whole life.
[75:22.23]Except right now.
[75:24.69]But this is not on television.
[75:26.95]Twitch television.
[75:28.68]It counts.
[75:35.25]Oh, we're going to get a replay?
[75:36.45]That's so cute.
[75:39.51]No, it's...
[75:43.24]I figured if I didn't move, maybe... I know, I figured if I didn't move, maybe you would screw it up and score on yourself.
[75:49.28]No, no, no.
[75:52.37]See, that's why I told you I'm completely in control.
[75:57.15]Here we go.
[75:58.31]Come on.
[75:58.71]Whatever.
[75:59.01]You're the weirdo at the foosball table, aren't you?
[76:03.30]Yeah, I'm the one spinning everything.
[76:05.02]Trying way too hard.
[76:06.08]Of course I am.
[76:07.68]What?
[76:08.10]You go to the ping pong table first?
[76:10.96]No.
[76:12.01]Like a real grown-ass man.
[76:17.19]I go to the giant Jenga.
[76:20.16]Of course.
[76:20.68]That's the first thing I go to.
[76:23.80]Jenga, please.
[76:25.06]Oh, come on.
[76:28.85]Jenga is so destructive.
[76:30.51]I actually get real anxiety when that tower comes crashing down.
[76:36.55]Maybe the big joke is scary.
[76:38.83]It's really scary.
[76:39.53]Like I got a bar or something.
[76:41.09]I don't like it.
[76:41.91]And everyone always kind of yells a little too loud when it's happening.
[76:44.09]So you're going to go here.
[76:45.22]It's going to.
[76:46.82]Okay.
[76:46.96]This one sucks.
[76:48.38]No, this one's awesome.
[76:49.22]This one doesn't know skill at all.
[76:50.80]This one is just.
[76:51.36]This is so tactical.
[76:53.37]I'm not even kidding you.
[76:54.97]I feel like right in my element.
[76:56.77]Additional.
[76:57.15]I didn't even move.
[77:01.54]This one feels like checkers to me.
[77:04.51]You know what?
[77:05.89]I feel like I was born for this one.
[77:13.94]Oh, my God.
[77:14.35]The goalkeeping.
[77:15.31]Insane.
[77:16.61]GG.
[77:18.21]Why does Jerma have eyeliner?
[77:20.70]Oh, the Eyelander.
[77:24.04]What's the Eyelander?
[77:27.09]It's got something back there.
[77:29.60]Wait, people say I look like I have eyeliner, but I just don't sleep well.
[77:34.95]It's so sad.
[77:39.63]But sometimes I just pretend like I'm wearing makeup.

[79:16.73]What are you talking about?
[79:19.47]That's not what I meant.
[79:20.95]I'm just saying.
[79:22.82]My life is not interesting.
[79:24.16]I don't do anything.
[79:24.96]That is very interesting.
[79:26.24]You're just wearing your underwear.
[79:27.84]With just like a pair of shoes on.
[79:29.41]Dude, do you know what I think is the funniest thing?
[79:32.45]Do you think...
[79:34.24]Have you ever done this for fun?
[79:35.32]Just like being a weirdo in your house.
[79:37.70]You're in your underwear and you put on shoes and socks with your underwear on and just kind of walk around and just make yourself laugh.
[79:45.20]You ever do that?
[79:47.12]No.
[79:47.82]It's funny.
[79:48.68]It's funny.
[79:49.08]Like you're alone and you just put on shoes and socks and your underwear and you're laughing.
[79:52.03]And you kind of just like walk around.
[79:53.19]You're like, oh, look at me.
[79:54.25]I'm getting ready for the day.
[79:55.21]You're in your underwear and you're in shoes and socks.
[79:58.99]That's like just a joke to yourself.
[80:00.84]It's just a joke.
[80:01.34]It's just for fun.
[80:02.06]For like a minute.
[80:03.82]For a minute.
[80:04.30]And then you like, but then you know what's sad about that, Jeremiah?
[80:06.86]And then you have to sit down.
[80:08.24]Okay.
[80:09.24]Like you have to sit down and take off your shoes and socks.
[80:12.13]Dude, I'm sorry.
[80:13.09]But the image of the dark side of the joke is taking off after your laugh subsides.
[80:20.37]You know?
[80:20.79]There's something so funny to me about like just underwear and being in like shoes and socks.
[80:25.74]That's crazy.
[80:27.16]Yeah.
[80:28.56]Yeah, but for like a second.
[80:30.38]Yeah, but isn't it funny for a second?
[80:33.61]I mean, it's just like, it's sort of like, you know, like, are you big into magic tricks?
[80:38.48]I used to be when I was young.
[80:40.36]Yeah, like, I love magic tricks.
[80:41.88]Like, when I worked in an office, I was, like, the big, like, magic... I, like, did a little magic show, magic guy.
[80:47.99]And so that was, like, my icebreaker.
[80:52.52]So my boss was like, oh, my God, like, you should put on a magic show for us.
[80:56.56]So then the next day, I come to the office super early, and I'm hiding cards everywhere.
[81:01.21]I'm stuffing my suit with, like, a handkerchief, and I'm super-duper excited.
[81:05.10]I wake up at, like, 4 a.m.,
[81:06.48]And then the next day, they just completely forget about the magic show.
[81:10.79]So I'm walking around all day with a sweaty handkerchief.
[81:15.05]It's like such a dark side of magic.
[81:17.78]And then like a week later, he's like, why is there a seven of hearts in my drawer?
[81:22.37]Is that weirder than making yourself laugh by walking around doing like the Yoshi with shoes on and in your underwear?
[81:30.00]yes that's way weirder the walking around by yourself in your underwear alright and jumping and going and going like and just pretending that you're the animal
[81:43.62]Yes, that's way weirder.
[81:45.38]What do you mean?
[81:46.16]Why do you have to be in your underwear for that?
[81:48.69]Like, what does that add to the Yoshi impression?
[81:51.33]Because Yoshi's in his underwear and shoes.
[81:54.72]No, he's not.
[81:55.70]He's not going, Yoshi just is in underwear.
[81:58.81]What character is in what it looked like a pair of underwear and just shoes?
[82:05.20]There's a character that does that.
[82:10.15]Like Tommy Pickles?
[82:12.21]Donald Duck.
[82:12.95]No, Donald Duck has... You've got to reverse.
[82:14.65]Donald Duck has no pants on in his shirt.
[82:16.49]And he doesn't have shoes on.
[82:17.62]Ban that person for an hour.
[82:19.26]Toad.
[82:19.60]Toad.
[82:19.96]The controls on this are... I don't like it.
[82:25.97]It's very sensitive.
[82:29.19]I actually really like this one.
[82:30.13]It takes... It's very precise.
[82:34.05]You watch curling?
[82:37.25]no actually I've yeah I have is this where this is where somebody with the broom falls around and goes yeah it's my favorite I actually think this is awesome like the sensitivity is just all wrong here oh I felt like I was going right are you using a joy-con by the way no I'm using a pro controller okay me too
[83:02.48]Okay, should we do like a couple more in this game?
[83:06.62]There's so many games we have to get through.
[83:08.20]We have a lot.
[83:09.19]Yeah.
[83:09.61]We have a lot.
[83:10.59]Alright.
[83:12.33]How about... Oh, let's do baseball.
[83:14.65]Oh, you're going to get destroyed at baseball.
[83:17.12]This is my favorite sport.
[83:19.58]I played it a little just to check it.
[83:22.06]You are going to get destroyed.
[83:24.76]And I think that if you're going to do channel point bets shit, bet everything on me.
[83:28.91]Oh, you're sure?
[83:30.07]Yes.
[83:30.87]Okay.
[83:31.47]Alright.
[83:32.21]Well, you know, baseball is it's more of like a mental game.
[83:35.78]You have to really get into the head of your opponent.
[83:38.52]Yeah, right.
[83:39.70]In 2005, I actually was a runner up T-ball champion.
[83:43.63]Hey, well, you could also bunt and run wicked fast to first base and get a massive on base percentage.
[83:50.26]Wait, how do you do that?
[83:50.98]I don't think you can do this game.
[83:54.20]Oh, shit.
[83:54.96]Wait.
[83:55.94]Alright.
[83:56.22]So what am I blue?
[83:58.75]Yeah.
[84:00.44]Okay, so the ball goes really fast.

[84:40.15]This is way harder than I thought it was going to be.
[84:43.64]It's so tough.
[84:46.80]I don't think either one of us is going to get on base.
[84:50.00]I don't think so.
[84:51.65]It's so hard to be a batter.
[84:53.13]Oh, my God.
[84:53.75]That was so slow.
[85:05.11]Dude, why?
[85:05.87]You shouldn't be able to pump the machine.
[85:07.49]You shouldn't be able to pump the machine like that.
[85:09.39]Alright, two can play this game.

[97:03.80]Why did mine go so much?
[97:04.95]I did the same speed as yours.
[97:09.16]You want to say inbounds.
[97:14.59]That was the same exact speed and placement of yours.
[97:19.56]Wait, you have to calculate.
[97:21.02]It's 183 yards to the hole, Jerma.
[97:25.64]Nice.
[97:26.18]Dude, double bogey.

[97:37.20]It's fine.
[97:39.76]Okay, that's like part of your like strategy or something.
[97:47.57]Oh, what a risk.
[97:51.39]You can do it.
[97:55.42]That should be the perfect drive.
[97:57.00]Oh my God.
[98:00.32]Further than you.
[98:02.18]Yeah, but I have the perfect putt.
[98:04.99]Watch this meter.
[98:07.73]Because if he drains this and I do the same meter...
[98:11.23]Okay, so let's all, let's all be reminded what he just did.
[98:17.88]Okay.
[98:20.64]Birdie.
[98:22.08]Oh, so you're just copying my meter.
[98:26.45]That's smart.
[98:28.55]I might give me like little tutorials.
[98:30.51]Hey, you're going to get a triple bogey on this one.
[98:33.86]I think you're wrong.
[98:36.16]Wait, why do I go first?
[98:37.86]Hit it into the trees.
[98:38.68]I know you want to do it.
[98:40.14]I won't.
[98:40.80]I actually want to be safe.
[98:44.44]Okay, that's... Ooh, bogey incoming.
[98:50.03]Oh, no, come on.
[98:51.69]That's insanity.
[98:55.22]Jerma, come on.
[98:56.24]That is irresponsible.
[99:03.37]This is way good.
[99:07.41]What's up?
[99:09.82]That was actually sick as hell.
[99:11.52]That was actually so cool.
[99:14.70]I'll come back.
[99:16.45]Just like the Yankees did this season.
[99:18.89]Hey, hey, hey.
[99:19.39]Shut up.
[99:21.95]Big Red Sox guy, huh?
[99:23.55]Explains a lot.
[99:27.60]Damn it.
[99:28.46]Shut up, dude.
[99:36.95]Damn it.
[99:37.13]What?
[99:39.63]Oof.
[99:43.15]Sink it.
[99:45.15]Here we go.
[99:48.65]This one you have to have like a really delicate touch.
[99:51.92]Ready?
[99:52.24]Don't mess it up.
[99:52.68]Just a little.
[99:53.96]Oh my god.
[99:56.88]Oh.
[99:57.30]I didn't think it registered.
[99:59.62]Oh.
[100:01.72]Oh.
[100:02.81]That's still fine.
[100:03.93]Hey.
[100:05.01]Rip.
[100:07.27]Hey.
[100:09.13]Does that put us in even?
[100:12.03]No.
[100:13.17]Oh, I'm negative one.
[100:14.15]You beat me by one stroke.
[100:16.89]That's huge.
[100:18.13]No, it's not.
[100:18.53]Like in the game of golf at the top level.
[100:20.62]Yeah, that's the difference between Tiger Woods and Golfer 2.
[100:23.66]I can't name another golfer.
[100:27.16]Golfer 2.
[100:27.80]Yeah, I couldn't name a single one.
[100:30.73]I choked.
[100:32.09]Alright, what do you want to do?
[100:33.59]We could do boxing.
[100:34.67]We could do air hockey.
[100:35.65]I mean, we could just move on.
[100:36.49]Oh, let's do air hockey.
[100:38.22]There's a lot of fun stuff.
[100:39.06]I love air hockey.
[100:40.46]I know.
[100:40.94]Air hockey.
[100:42.97]No, let's just do them all.
[100:44.45]They're so good.
[100:45.27]I don't need to explain anything.
[100:47.40]Alright, we're good.
[100:47.96]Yeah, we don't need an explanation.
[100:50.82]Yeah, come on.
[100:52.45]Play to five points?
[100:54.75]Wait, so you completely made fun of me for playing foosball, but you're a defender of air hockey?
[100:59.74]You think air hockey's cooler?
[101:01.04]uh air hockey is so much cooler because uh when you can you put your hand down on a foosball table and get the that cool crisp air to blow at like 10 different spots on your hand and it feels pretty cool we're gonna get a three two one go oh shit okay ready wait I what do you we don't get three two one go
[101:26.73]Are you right?
[101:28.23]The rules of battle.
[101:29.07]You didn't have the rules.
[101:30.35]Hey.
[101:32.15]Alright.
[101:32.39]Ready?
[101:32.61]Three, two, one.
[101:34.75]Go.
[101:36.86]Wait.
[101:37.16]Have you ever been laser tag?
[101:39.92]Like laser tagging?
[101:41.04]Yeah.
[101:41.92]What's your favorite part about it?
[101:44.42]Well, I just like running around.
[101:45.87]I don't know.
[101:46.47]Something about it.
[101:47.03]It just feels so cool.
[101:48.69]Laser tag is really fun.
[101:49.61]All the time.
[101:50.57]All the time.
[101:50.87]I think that if I would rank laser tag of like that.
[101:53.41]What about paintball?
[101:54.03]Do you like paintball?
[101:55.26]I've never been.
[101:56.54]Really?
[101:57.14]That's fun.
[101:57.77]Yeah.
[101:58.79]Really?
[101:59.01]Is that a laser tag?
[102:00.29]Oh yeah.
[102:00.67]Paintball is awesome.
[102:01.77]Especially, you know, I have to be, I'm a wuss.
[102:05.34]I get the vest that makes it so you don't get hurt.
[102:08.80]Oh yeah.
[102:09.08]I do that too.
[102:09.86]Yeah.
[102:11.21]But it doesn't matter.
[102:11.95]So if you have the, you do all the armor and shit, but it doesn't do anything because if somebody gets you in the neck, one ends up sneaking up and hitting you in the neck and it sucks.
[102:22.70]Nice point, by the way.
[102:23.56]Didn't that give you, like, a welt?
[102:25.56]It sucks.
[102:27.41]Yeah, it's terrible.
[102:29.13]Wait, you're camping.
[102:30.71]That's, like, really frowned upon in the community.
[102:33.50]I was just talking.
[102:39.53]Oh.
[102:44.25]Oh, I wonder if it should be better.
[102:51.44]Because here's the thing.
[102:52.56]Like, I loved going to laser tagging when I was in college.
[102:57.43]But the problem is most people who laser tag are like eighth graders.
[103:01.58]So we would just basically ruin an eighth grader's birthday party.
[103:06.54]You do a thing that I just did, which is you just talk and I score myself.
[103:10.33]What do you mean?
[103:11.25]No, I'm just saying, you know, it's just so fun.
[103:15.94]Damn it!
[103:18.59]Alright, do you do the thing in laser tag where you you find the one unsuspecting Sorry, son of a bitch that you see that they have like, you know You've got the spot to shoot on their shoulders the spot to shoot on their back and their chest and they don't realize that you're kind of targeting their shoulder and you just go And you just follow this person around for like 20 minutes
[103:48.10]Yeah, of course.
[103:49.53]Yeah, they have no clue.
[103:50.75]You farm this person.
[103:52.95]You farm them for like half an hour.
[103:54.81]Yeah, and they're like an 8th grader.
[103:56.62]And you just pulse up your points and it's this guy's birthday.
[104:02.35]We're not going to have 3-2-1?
[104:04.53]Oh, I'm sorry.
[104:05.15]You can get a point if you want.
[104:07.95]Do you want a point?
[104:08.82]No, no, it's good.
[104:11.34]I'll make a comeback.
[104:12.88]Alright.
[104:17.60]Okay, putt-putt golf.
[104:19.97]Nice shot, actually.
[104:21.07]I hate it.
[104:22.51]Thank you.
[104:23.19]Absolutely despise it.
[104:25.55]Something about mini golf, it increases my rage meter for some reason by 10 million.
[104:32.10]I don't know why.
[104:33.53]I don't know why.
[104:34.23]It's so whimsical.
[104:35.23]It's like a windmill.
[104:36.25]No, it's painful.
[104:39.12]I would think you'd like it no it sucks because if you usually you go with three or four people and by the way good gg you go with like what usually about three to five people uh-huh I feel the same way about bowling
[104:53.21]When you are bowling and there's two or three people that are just draining strikes and they're doing so good.
[104:59.74]Oh, well, dude, nice 7-10 split.
[105:01.18]You actually hit it.
[105:01.94]Oh, dude, nice spare.
[105:03.58]Oh, oh, dude, Mike, Michael, nice spare.
[105:06.73]And then you go up and you gutter ball five times in a row.
[105:09.53]You don't want to be there anymore.
[105:10.41]You hate being there.
[105:12.92]If you're bowling a 40 and four of the people are bowling a 150 or something, it's just like, why the fuck am I here?
[105:19.31]It's just embarrassing.
[105:20.33]And they're just looking at you.
[105:22.01]mini golf is very similar because somebody oh dude oh whoa you just so close to the hole and then you go and you hit you it up you hit oh it bounced out it bounced out of the play area oh well that's two strokes I guess and then you have to do the thing where you drag the ball around in a circle around the hole because you're seven or eight strokes
[105:42.03]Yeah, but like, do you go to these places to like win?
[105:44.73]Like it's supposed to be just for fun, Jerma.
[105:46.47]Like it's not like a, you're not like competing in the PGA or whatever.
[105:49.92]Like you're just supposed to like try to get into the windmill and stuff.
[105:53.02]Exactly.
[105:53.78]Everybody, that's true.
[105:55.63]Everybody has fun doing these things until you do so poorly that it becomes noticeable.
[106:03.68]Right.
[106:03.98]That's the problem.
[106:04.88]Oh, there's no three, two, one.
[106:06.10]That scared the shit out of me.
[106:07.32]That's fine.
[106:10.85]When you drag the ball into the hole for like the fourth hole in a row, you're kind of like, what the fuck am I doing here?
[106:18.68]I could be mowing the lawn right now.
[106:21.56]Oh, that's your alternative instead of playing mini golf with your friends.
[106:25.41]To mow the lawn.
[106:27.25]That's your example.
[106:28.25]You could have been saying like playing Oblivion or something.
[106:32.51]That's your afternoon.
[106:33.39]That's true.
[106:34.29]That's true.
[106:36.12]Okay.
[106:36.57]Hey, are you a spiral or are you a horizontal row, vertical row when it comes to mowing the lawn?
[106:42.38]Well, I live in New York City, so I don't have a lawn.
[106:44.94]Hey, I live in Las Vegas.
[106:45.84]Me either.
[106:48.51]So you're a hypothetical lawn.
[106:50.89]Gotcha.
[106:53.77]Oh.
[106:56.64]Damn it.
[106:58.18]Why is this so difficult?
[106:59.26]I feel like I'm barely in control of this stupid paddle.
[107:01.52]Oh.
[107:02.20]Hey, it's not stupid.
[107:03.66]Did you say the stupid paddle?
[107:06.71]It's stupid.
[107:07.61]I hate it.
[107:08.29]Oh my God.
[107:09.51]Hey, somebody don't invite this guy to bowling next week.
[107:13.54]Yeah, big bowling outing you're planning.
[107:15.62]You probably like it with the freaking railings.
[107:19.73]That'd be the worst stream ever, I think.
[107:22.01]Bowling?
[107:22.75]Getting like a bunch of streamers together to bowl.
[107:25.09]I feel like I wouldn't want to.
[107:26.05]I wouldn't want to do that.
[107:27.75]No, I'd be terrible.
[107:28.79]He's like, oh, here comes Jerma.
[107:30.99]Oh, he misses again.
[107:33.26]Gutterball.
[107:34.04]It would suck.
[107:38.90]Alright, GG.
[107:40.91]Okay, so what's up?
[107:41.81]You want to just keep going with this one?
[107:42.95]We've been playing this for two hours.
[107:44.27]I mean, we could do the next one, but there's so many good games.
[107:49.10]There are a lot of good ones.
[107:50.18]What about Shooting Gallery?
[107:53.14]Oh, is this an aiming one?
[107:54.41]Like, do we have to use joycons, I wonder?
[107:56.22]Uh, maybe.
[107:57.42]Let's see.
[107:59.28]If it's Joy-Cons, then that'd be fun.
[108:01.56]Hold on, I got my gin and tonic here.
[108:06.21]I don't know what it looks like on camera, but I hear it.
[108:09.27]It sounds like just like an aluminum cup.
[108:12.38]Like this large aluminum cup with like a ton of ice.
[108:14.84]I don't know what that sounds like.
[108:17.58]It's a prop.
[108:19.39]Like, what is that?
[108:21.01]That is exactly what it is.
[108:21.99]Alright, do we need the Joy-Cons?
[108:24.33]Uh...
[108:25.75]I don't know.
[108:28.03]It's not prompting us.
[108:29.39]It is not prompting us.
[108:30.39]Let's see.
[108:32.78]How confident are you with analog?
[108:36.30]Not confident.
[108:37.68]Oh, my God.
[108:38.08]It is with our stick.
[108:40.62]Cool.
[108:42.25]Wait, do we just do random balloons?
[108:45.13]I think so.
[108:50.67]We got a spammer here, it seems like.
[108:53.12]Wait, how are you?
[108:53.90]You're beating me.
[109:04.51]That was a blue shell equivalent.
[109:07.12]What do you mean?
[109:07.60]No, that wasn't like a handicap or whatever.
[109:14.97]Dude hits a blue shell.
[109:16.33]Dude hits a blue shell and fucking wins.
[109:19.20]Let's freaking go.
[109:33.45]Oh shit, there's some negatives!
[109:35.27]What the fuck, I hit all of them!
[109:38.78]Oh god!
[109:38.94]We can't just spam.
[109:41.84]I'm actually glad that they added that.
[109:45.17]God, it's so close.
[109:50.17]How did you spam so fa- You got one of those turbo buttons?
[109:59.64]I just started locking in so fast okay I'm gonna lock in oh god oh careful careful careful careful careful you got the fucking blue shell again bro
[110:27.89]My aim is so bad.
[110:29.55]They don't show us the scores anymore.
[110:33.02]I don't like that.
[110:40.09]Oh, my God.
[110:41.49]You owned.
[110:42.81]No, that one is.
[110:44.59]Hey, do it.
[110:45.21]Can you do it?
[110:45.91]Come on.
[110:46.80]Come on.
[110:48.08]No.
[110:48.52]I feel like you can do it.
[110:50.66]Oh, he did it.
[110:51.42]What did you say?
[110:55.41]Sorry.
[110:55.65]I was relishing in my victory.
[110:58.33]nothing I just feel I said I feel like you do at bowling or mini golf and everyone's just watching me miss uh oh the sport of course battle tanks let's keep it going versus tank let's go alright do you have sports in your stream title because I think I do I have uh yeah I have sports with a basketball yeah
[111:25.94]I don't even know if... Is the game selected?
[111:28.36]I don't know if one of my mods changed.
[111:30.83]Maybe they did.
[111:32.79]Alright, so we'll shoot each other.
[111:34.83]Yeah, I think it might be on, like, scary games.
[111:38.26]Okay, it is.
[111:38.74]Alright, cool.
[111:43.89]Oh.
[111:44.07]One of my mods changed the game.
[111:46.51]What does your game say?
[111:48.77]I think mine just says, just chatting.
[111:53.90]Sorry, I did not check.
[111:55.06]Just chatting.
[111:58.33]It's like sports.
[112:00.67]Wait, how do you aim up?
[112:02.63]How do you do that?
[112:03.11]Looking at the instructions.
[112:05.32]Don't make this like a teachable moment.
[112:07.14]Oh, here, up.
[112:08.14]Here we go.
[112:10.72]Alright, good luck.
[112:14.71]So much destruction.
[112:17.05]It's so evil.
[112:19.00]What the fuck?
[112:19.86]It's one hit kill?
[112:21.00]I didn't know that.
[112:22.10]Oh my god.
[112:25.39]30 seconds?
[112:26.55]Wait, what if I just avoid you?
[112:27.79]No shit!
[112:36.64]They go infinitely!
[112:39.67]That scared the fuck out of me.
[112:40.53]I thought you were going to spawn in front of me.
[112:42.81]Wait, I guess it's the same spawn every time.
[112:51.38]We're doing this one again.
[112:53.12]We're doing this one again.
[112:53.92]I didn't know that you spawned in the same place.
[112:55.86]This one's awesome.
[112:59.03]This one's actually sick.
[113:06.18]After this stream, walking over to the garbage can, taking the switch off the dock, holding it like this, opening and boop, dropping it into the trash.
[113:17.60]After all the games you downloaded?
[113:19.56]Come on.
[113:20.34]This is a part one of 12.
[113:24.61]Like, what are you talking about?
[113:26.41]There's so many games now.
[113:28.83]It's so funny that you were like, hey, man, like, maybe we should, here's like five games.
[113:33.26]I'm like, oh, I got like four or five too.
[113:34.60]Here's a couple.
[113:36.62]We just got too excited.
[113:37.50]We got too excited.
[113:39.18]We got way too excited.
[113:40.18]Oh, that's a good game.
[113:41.10]That's a good game.
[113:41.84]We just kept going and going.
[113:43.23]Oh.
[113:47.23]Look at you, like, shoulder peeking.
[113:49.22]Wait, you really did love CS:GO.
[113:54.63]Dude, I like Counter-Strike where it was gun game.
[113:56.55]That was fun.
[113:57.79]Oh, I loved it in Source.
[114:00.49]They should make a game where it's just gun.
[114:02.32]That's only gun game is the whole game.
[114:05.26]Yeah.
[114:05.96]Wait, remember, like, Xbox Live Arcade 1 versus 100?
[114:08.95]That's what I want.
[114:12.55]Oh my god.
[114:13.27]What is this, like, angle?
[114:16.28]strategizing playing worms oh no okay come here my control where are you going where are you going where are you going where are you going oh this angle oh man we gotta go again obviously we have to go again obviously tiebreaker
[114:43.11]This one is fun.
[114:44.69]This one's so good.
[114:45.63]This one should be a full game.
[114:46.95]I think we can change the field.
[114:48.58]We've been on the same field the whole time.
[114:50.70]Oh, it's like a different map?
[114:51.88]Yeah, we should try that.
[114:56.47]Okay, good luck.
[114:57.35]I wonder what the spikes are in the middle.
[115:01.01]Oh, shit.
[115:01.53]How did that go over you?
[115:04.34]It went right through me.
[115:07.34]Wait, can my bullets hit me?
[115:08.94]No.
[115:09.87]No.
[115:12.12]Dude, that angle is nasty.
[115:14.30]I don't get it.
[115:15.44]Oh, nice.
[115:34.70]Easy.
[115:35.10]Careful.
[115:38.41]We traded.
[115:39.13]Dang it.
[115:41.68]Alright, lobbing.
[115:47.17]That shit out of here.
[115:47.89]10 seconds?
[115:48.31]I wish these rounds were longer.
[115:55.88]Oh!
[115:55.96]What if I do it off this wall?
[115:57.88]Hey, that's another draw.
[115:58.98]Damn!
[116:00.08]We're so equally matched.
[116:02.80]Somebody said, are you going to put your hand in a man bun?
[116:05.26]Wait, you know what's so fun?
[116:06.67]Jerma topgolfed.
[116:10.12]you've got to try top golf have you tried oh okay that's like a good like not mini golf but like you just get to hit the ball as hard as possible that's true have like little fun little mini games like you can do like angry birds top golf or whatever that would be a great stream ah maybe for like five seconds is there a guy okay but is there a guy in a full suit of armor that walks around with a sword and like kind of swings it around out there
[116:35.24]In Topgolf?
[116:36.40]Yeah.
[116:37.57]No, no, there's no guy like that.
[116:39.03]There's nobody in a full clown costume driving around with like a bunch of protection around them and like honking a horn and stuff and being like, you're never gonna get me.
[116:46.90]No, no, I think that's something else.
[116:49.18]There's a car.
[116:52.11]Why, why?
[116:52.53]Is that something you think that's missing from Topgolf?
[116:55.37]I feel like that'd be kind of fun if it was somebody in like a full, completely protected suit of armor where they were never gonna get hurt.
[117:00.84]Yeah.
[117:01.14]And they just run around.
[117:02.14]Right.
[117:03.49]Just around while people are just distracting people and helping?
[117:06.77]No, just like try to get them.
[117:09.64]Oh, like in the field?
[117:11.02]Yeah.
[117:12.72]Oh, yeah.
[117:13.12]Wait, that's a great idea.
[117:14.34]Yeah, we're talking head to toe, like total protection.
[117:18.17]Like whatever scientific method they need to make it so it's impossible for this person to get hurt.
[117:24.65]Oh, you tried to change it up and it was a bad idea.
[117:27.59]Damn it.
[117:30.37]Damn it.
[117:33.74]And they could be out there giving the finger and stuff.
[117:37.30]Like an insult.
[117:39.49]Like an affair.
[117:40.23]Like an insult guy where you have to throw balloons.
[117:42.31]Wait, this is actually a genius idea.
[117:44.33]Because there's just a guy in a cart out there.
[117:46.14]Yeah, he's doing donuts in a circle and he's got his middle finger hand out the window.
[117:51.16]He's mean.
[117:51.70]He's like, your fucking swing sucks.
[117:53.71]And dress him up in other sports teams, rival teams attire.
[117:59.07]If you know you've got to be like the Boston Red Sox.
[118:01.44]Yeah.
[118:01.74]Like, let's say you've got a big like a big party's coming in.
[118:03.50]Like, oh, yeah, it's me and my and my my my my Boston mates.
[118:07.22]And we're all from Boston.
[118:08.12]We all love the Red Sox.
[118:09.13]I can plan something around that.
[118:10.85]This guy, this guy's a big clown costume.
[118:12.35]He's wearing like the Yankees outfit.
[118:14.99]Wait, that's a great idea.
[118:16.21]And he's running around going like, um... He has like a big megaphone, and he's screaming into it, going like, Oh, yeah!
[118:23.64]Remember?
[118:24.40]Uh, 2003!
[118:24.74]2003!
[118:25.78]Uh, David Ortiz ain't shit!
[118:28.42]And it's like, wait, what the fuck did he say?
[118:31.75]Then they really start fucking aiming for him.
[118:33.89]Aim for the head.
[118:34.55]Wait, I gotta kill you, Jerma!
[118:39.08]What's happening?
[118:40.46]You're distracting me.
[118:42.62]Oh my god.
[118:43.38]No...
[118:45.97]What's happening?
[118:46.95]This is like your plushie incident, but I'm getting distracted by your great ideas.
[118:51.75]Now I'm hiding.
[118:55.45]Dude, don't talk about Big Papi like that.
[118:57.22]Hey, I'll tell you, I remember watching the 2004 World Series.
[119:00.83]That was one of the greatest weeks of my life.
[119:03.67]2004 World Series.
[119:05.34]Oh man, it was Red Sox.
[119:06.50]It was so awesome.
[119:07.78]Biggest comeback ever.
[119:08.84]They swept it.
[119:09.58]They came back and blew out the Yankees.
[119:12.45]They kept going.
[119:13.07]They won everything.
[119:13.87]It was the greatest week of my life.
[119:16.53]Wait, so you actually like baseball?
[119:18.66]I used to.
[119:19.04]That's cool.
[119:23.40]Actually, I wish I was into sports.
[119:29.03]I'm just into esports.
[119:31.35]Well, you're into toy tennis.
[119:33.70]Well, not anymore.
[119:35.64]I'm gonna uninstall this game after this.
[119:39.00]Alright, we gotta do one Ring of Bowling.
[119:41.16]That's it.
[119:42.57]Yeah, deal.
[119:44.19]And then we're switching to another game, obviously.
[119:46.01]Yes.
[119:47.47]I'm gonna get up and take another break in about two minutes.
[119:50.78]Sorry.
[119:51.76]I'm so hot in here.
[119:54.70]I need to turn on the AC.
[119:58.18]Just by playing sports games.
[120:00.29]It's hot, yeah.
[120:02.13]You're moving around.
[120:04.56]I'm sitting here.
[120:06.36]I'm leaning in.
[120:07.04]I'm leaning out.
[120:07.72]I don't get it.
[120:09.85]Oh, we can do both.
[120:11.03]Oh, wait.
[120:11.93]We have to use touch Joy-Cons.
[120:14.07]That's fine.
[120:14.65]Do we need to beat both or just one?
[120:17.30]A single Joy-Con?
[120:18.56]Is it a single?
[120:19.26]Oh, we can do both.
[120:20.02]Let's do both.
[120:22.30]Oh, no.
[120:22.58]It must be.
[120:23.26]Oh, my God.
[120:24.04]My computer just crashed.
[120:25.75]We good?
[120:26.39]Wait.
[120:27.33]I can hear you.
[120:28.05]Can you hear me?
[120:29.45]I'll do the single.
[120:32.79]Let's do single.
[120:34.46]OK.
[120:37.95]OK, I'm ready.
[120:39.31]OK, I'm ready.
[120:40.05]I think it's your turn.
[120:41.87]Alright.
[120:42.21]So aim.
[120:46.35]Oh, my God.
[120:46.69]Wait, this is like your big fear.
[120:48.79]This is a huge fear of mine, actually.
[120:50.20]Yeah.
[120:51.16]Guys, hearts in the chat for Jerma, no matter what happens.
[120:54.04]Don't call him gutter boy or whatever.
[120:59.72]Be so rude.
[121:02.37]Oh, my God.
[121:03.21]What a start.
[121:06.41]Wait, that was awesome.
[121:07.57]Call me Gutter Boy again.
[121:08.77]No one's going to call you Gutter Boy, obviously.
[121:12.64]That was incredible.
[121:13.80]I mean, the good news is, no matter what, you got your plushie collection.
[121:18.52]I don't know why I'm like, oh, Gutter Boy.
[121:24.21]Oh, no.
[121:26.86]This is my worst fear.
[121:28.20]Okay, hold on.
[121:30.36]I think it's my, it must be the Joy-Cons, you know?
[121:33.83]Okay, hold on.
[121:34.93]Here we go.
[121:36.36]I'll snooze my ads.
[121:38.42]We got five minutes.
[121:46.48]That was pretty good.
[121:47.10]Why is my ball not going fast?
[121:50.84]Because you're not putting a lot of rage behind it.
[121:55.17]You're right.
[121:55.57]I should have had my protein shake before this.
[122:00.66]What was that?
[122:02.58]I just heard, like, a gust of wind.
[122:05.77]Did you actually?
[122:07.31]Yeah, I heard, like, a gust of wind and nothing happened.
[122:14.04]I'll get this.
[122:15.04]Let's see it.
[122:18.38]I feel like in this one you're trying extra hard because of your bowling anecdote.
[122:23.27]Like, you really don't want to.
[122:24.67]This is fun.
[122:25.33]Like, I've never seen you like this.
[122:27.32]Okay, here we go.
[122:30.65]Hey, there you go.
[122:32.25]There we go.
[122:33.61]There you go.
[122:36.92]That's alright.
[122:37.98]You just made it interesting.
[122:39.10]Now it's interesting.
[122:41.20]Okay.
[122:42.80]Good luck.
[122:47.19]Oh, man.
[122:51.64]That's a tough one.
[122:52.84]You got a spare though here for sure.
[123:01.53]I'm playing this in a recliner.
[123:03.07]I need to stand up and do the... This is how old people do this.
[123:08.48]I'm standing up every time.
[123:09.52]This is how old people do this.
[123:14.03]Ow!
[123:24.46]How did I get caught in my pocket?
[123:28.99]I got caught in my pocket.
[123:31.53]You OK?
[123:33.47]Are you OK?
[123:39.06]I just hear these crazy noises.
[123:43.00]The balls.
[123:44.27]I don't know how I could come.
[123:46.09]Wait, I just hear like a crackle.
[123:47.73]What's going on?
[123:50.71]Why is this lagging?
[123:52.15]The switch is lagging.
[123:53.90]It actually is lagging.
[123:59.42]What?
[123:59.96]Oh, here we go.
[124:03.36]You piece of shit.
[124:06.22]That was unlucky.
[124:08.48]Okay.
[124:09.89]If you don't get a strike here, I got an opportunity.
[124:12.77]Oh, I got a strike.
[124:16.22]Okay.
[124:17.62]Wait, what?
[124:18.24]My aim isn't working.
[124:23.17]Okay, that's fine.
[124:23.77]Damn.
[124:24.61]Damn, damn, damn.
[124:26.91]I'm not going to be able to hear you for the next one, but it's okay.
[124:30.44]Why?
[124:30.56]Are you putting off your headphones?
[124:31.54]I'm going to take my headphones off and I'm going to stand up.
[124:33.88]Okay.
[124:34.08]Alright, good luck, Jerma.
[124:40.58]Thank you.
[124:40.98]This is the last one.
[124:41.62]I gotta make a comp.
[124:43.06]Good luck.
[124:44.09]Alright, here we have Jerma for the final bowl of the career.
[124:48.98]Standing up, take an aim.
[124:51.12]A lot riding on it.
[124:52.24]$1 million on the line.
[124:55.42]A lot of pressure.
[124:56.22]Let's see if he's able to perform doing his stretches.
[124:58.86]Aiming for the right side.
[124:59.80]He has a really good bowl rate at this side.
[125:02.17]A really good maneuver.
[125:03.55]Take an aim.
[125:04.71]Unable to completely miss the ball.
[125:08.73]Here we go.
[125:09.05]Take an aim.
[125:09.74]Missing strike two.
[125:11.70]Strike two.
[125:12.14]Here we go.
[125:12.48]Take an aim.
[125:13.88]Oh, and it's just three strikes.
[125:15.68]But we're going to give him another attempt here.
[125:17.77]There he goes.
[125:19.23]Strike to the right.
[125:20.95]But he's still got another attempt.
[125:22.57]Let's see if he can get a spare.
[125:25.79]Here we go.
[125:26.39]It's still possible.
[125:27.31]Jerma with another attempt.
[125:31.60]Let's see if he can do it.
[125:38.70]It looks like Gutter Boy is better.
[125:42.39]And it looks like his shot at winning ends with a whimper.
[125:46.39]Dude, nobody would be funny if you threw it in the gutter.
[125:49.51]Here we go.
[125:53.18]What the hell is not working?
[125:56.23]Shit.
[125:58.28]Your fly is down?
[125:59.32]I don't have a fly in these pants.
[126:00.92]Damn it.
[126:04.40]Now I... I suck so bad.
[126:06.45]Man, have we talked about bowling at 50?
[126:15.91]Oh my god, that was... What a rush.
[126:19.18]Good game.
[126:19.48]My hand hurts.
[126:20.20]My fingers hurt now.
[126:22.44]Are you okay?
[126:23.67]I don't know.
[126:24.39]I thought I was going to have to postpone the rest of the stream.
[126:28.90]Getting stuck your hands in your pocket sounds brutal.
[126:31.88]It was fun.
[126:35.17]I'll be back in like three minutes.
[126:37.91]Okay.
[126:38.49]And then we'll move to another game.
[126:40.51]Perfect.
[126:41.77]Honestly, there's 51 games in this thing.
[126:43.63]That was a lot of fun.
[126:44.53]I think this is worth it.
[126:45.44]It's great.
[126:46.20]It's amazing.
[126:46.66]It's a perfect travel game, honestly.
[126:49.94]Alrighty.
[126:50.60]See you guys in a minute.
[131:36.45]There is a special request that I'm seeing.
[131:41.32]And that is a special request to play Yahtzee.
[131:46.88]Hold on.
[131:47.20]Let me put this over here.
[131:50.29]Oh, shit.
[131:50.87]I don't know how to get that to work.
[131:55.93]Squeak still might be BRB.
[131:58.12]We're good.
[132:01.92]Is it still on?
[132:04.68]Great.
[132:06.93]Is it?
[132:14.14]I have to change my grip order.
[132:24.33]Hello?
[132:24.79]Hello.
[132:26.91]What's up?
[132:27.51]You beat me.
[132:28.67]I did.
[132:29.36]I've been here for like 10 minutes.
[132:33.03]Are you serious?
[132:33.89]No.
[132:35.50]Okay, I was going to say, I was like, wow, time flew.
[132:40.98]We got to play Yahtzee, apparently.
[132:43.09]There's a special request for it.
[132:45.41]Yahtzee?
[132:46.53]There is a special request for it.
[132:48.05]Like a dice game?
[132:48.92]In Clubhouse Games.
[132:49.94]In Clubhouse Games.
[132:52.14]Let's do it.
[132:53.24]I don't think, I'd have to get a refresher on how to play Yahtzee, though.
[132:57.13]So Yahtzee, it's like dice poker?
[133:01.57]Where is it?
[133:05.37]Ooh.
[133:07.81]Wait, I played Mario Yahtzee, actually.
[133:10.07]It's perfect.
[133:11.83]That is exactly what we're doing.
[133:13.60]Okay, perfect.
[133:15.00]So you roll stuff, and you're trying to get the best kind of poker combination with the dice you have.
[133:21.51]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[133:22.65]I think I do remember.
[133:24.49]Yeah, so I think if I claim one, I don't think you can claim it.
[133:29.36]Maybe you can.
[133:30.02]Oh, so we're sharing dice?
[133:34.38]Do we share it?
[133:35.47]Huh, the three ones could be something.
[133:38.05]Yeah, I'll keep those and try the other two again.
[133:41.48]I forget like the strategy.
[133:42.52]Is this going to be another checker situation though?
[133:46.87]Where you like pretend and then you have like four or five kings on the board.
[133:50.59]It's funny, you said Mario.
[133:51.69]It's quite simple.
[133:53.12]You said Mario Yahtzee.
[133:54.74]I think we both played it at the same time.
[133:58.00]That's the last time both of us have played it.
[133:59.63]Because I played Mario Yahtzee the last time I ever played Yahtzee.
[134:02.86]Oh, you're kidding.
[134:03.92]Wait, the one on the... on DOS or whatever?
[134:06.27]That's the one.
[134:08.29]That's so funny.
[134:09.35]Alright, here we go.
[134:10.04]It's such a relic.
[134:14.77]Okay.
[134:14.91]Okay.
[134:15.89]I go... Ooh!
[134:18.84]Wait, that's insane.
[134:19.76]That's insane!
[134:24.16]And just to be clear, Yahtzee is a sport, just in case the chatters are curious.
[134:28.46]Oh, yeah.
[134:29.08]We're counting this.
[134:29.76]Yeah, it's a huge sport.
[134:31.96]And I'm putting this under small straight.
[134:39.11]Two, three, four.
[134:40.97]Wait.
[134:43.04]19 isn't bad either.
[134:43.96]Oh, for choice, you just get to decide, hey, I want to take the points.
[134:49.27]okay wait four numbers in ascending order wait I can re-roll can't I I can I think you can you can re-roll the fifth oh okay let's go for a big straight oh my god I guess I can roll again oh that's alright I'll take the small straight
[135:16.20]mark it good luck okay so now I have to beat that no you just have we just have to get the highest points at the end of all this wins so you could try to make whatever you're trying to make here you got uh you got two sixes you got two twos you could go for a full house but that's a full house with twos and sixes which that's alright yeah could be worse you know what I might go for a full house oops and I'm gonna re-roll this
[135:45.64]You're looking for a six.
[135:47.59]Yep.
[135:47.73]Okay, that's good.
[135:48.95]And I get it.
[135:50.59]That's alright.
[135:52.47]Perfect.
[135:52.75]Yeah, that's good.
[135:54.50]Mark it down in full house.
[135:58.04]Wait, that's so lucky.
[136:00.36]How did that work?
[136:02.01]You could have also tried to go for four sixes or five sixes.
[136:05.93]Oh, that would have been insane.
[136:07.03]That would have been insane.
[136:09.70]Oh, but then I can't get another full house, right?
[136:11.80]Nope.
[136:12.28]Because it's a weak full house.
[136:14.06]Oh, okay, gotcha.
[136:15.90]Alright, you know what I'm going for?
[136:17.30]I'm going for the fours.
[136:20.33]Four fours?
[136:21.15]I'm going for fours.
[136:23.25]Wow.
[136:30.24]Shit.
[136:30.64]Wait, Yachty's awesome.
[136:32.78]I'm doing it again.
[136:34.40]Okay.
[136:37.21]Alright, I could do... Choice is not a terrible thing here.
[136:41.28]17 for choice.
[136:42.12]That's not terrible.
[136:43.74]That could be worse.
[136:45.05]Oh, choice is just like you add up all of them?
[136:47.07]I believe choice is... That's a waste.
[136:50.55]Wait, just do two pair?
[136:52.42]I don't know if I want to do two pair.
[136:53.60]There is no two pair.
[137:01.79]Just do the twos.
[137:05.33]Yeah, that's true.
[137:08.97]Good luck.
[137:10.42]Thank you.
[137:10.98]Oh, I'm going to go for threes.
[137:18.28]I'm going to go for threes.
[137:21.67]Good luck.
[137:23.31]Yahtzee's fun.
[137:24.93]Yahtzee's awesome.
[137:29.52]Is that the same roll we just had?
[137:33.82]Yeah.
[137:33.94]Alright, here we go.
[137:34.82]Threes.

[138:11.56]All five have to be it.
[138:12.44]Okay.
[138:12.56]Five of a kind.
[138:18.31]No, no.
[138:18.47]I don't want to do that.
[138:20.95]Alright.
[138:21.15]I'm going for fives.
[138:23.07]Throw it.
[138:26.46]I believe...
[138:28.57]That one looked like it was going on a five.
[138:31.64]That was dog shit.
[138:32.62]Wait, they hate you.
[138:33.66]They don't like me.
[138:35.02]They hate you.
[138:36.40]They're rigging it against you.
[138:38.45]What the hell?
[138:40.51]That's unlucky.
[138:41.33]I'm taking choice.
[138:44.96]I don't care.
[138:45.72]Choice.
[138:46.32]Wait, that's a good choice, though, because it's such a high roll.
[138:48.56]Yeah, it's not bad.
[138:53.69]That helps.
[138:56.52]Oh, I'm going for five fives.
[138:58.51]That's what I just did.
[138:59.17]Be careful.
[139:00.27]Oh, shit.
[139:01.83]Yeah, but I got it.
[139:02.70]Ready?
[139:09.41]Don't even think about it.
[139:10.07]Don't do it.
[139:11.11]Boom.
[139:12.87]What the fuck?
[139:16.72]You might get a Yahtzee with this.
[139:17.88]If you get a Yahtzee, you're pissed.
[139:19.78]Come on!
[139:22.15]Yeah!

[139:52.39]I might just go for ones, honestly.
[139:55.55]I'm going for ones.
[139:57.74]If I roll a bunch of sixes, I'm going to be pissed.
[140:02.54]I mean, Yahtzee is gambling, right?
[140:05.26]I could try to get a full straight here.
[140:06.80]I'm going for the straight.
[140:12.05]Alright, let's see it.
[140:13.03]No, no, no.
[140:13.53]I need... I need wave.
[140:16.25]No.
[140:16.63]I'm not going to do it.
[140:20.37]I'm doing it.
[140:20.92]Let's go.
[140:21.32]I'm doing the sixes.
[140:22.00]Fuck it.
[140:23.61]This is such a bad idea.
[140:24.81]This is such a stupid idea.
[140:25.81]No, no, it's a good idea.
[140:26.69]It's a good idea.
[140:27.27]You have to will it.
[140:29.36]Okay.
[140:29.48]There we go.
[140:30.14]Alright.
[140:30.56]That's a damn good full house, by the way.
[140:34.14]Yeah, but you're going for sixes, I thought.
[140:36.00]No, that is a damn good full house.
[140:38.15]Take the sixes.
[140:44.27]Oh, no.
[140:47.94]Come on.
[140:51.20]I could go for a straight.
[140:54.72]Oh wait, two, three, four.
[140:57.27]Yeah.
[140:58.23]You look at one, two, three, four.
[141:00.11]You need a small straight is four.
[141:05.10]Yeah.
[141:05.68]So you'd want a one.
[141:11.23]Or I can get a five, no?
[141:14.17]Six, five, four.
[141:14.91]Yep.
[141:15.27]Five or a one is good.
[141:17.29]Yeah.
[141:17.69]So I want to roll this.
[141:24.90]There we go.
[141:25.72]Wow, I'm so lucky.
[141:26.92]Now you could roll it again for five, which would be pretty PogChamp.
[141:32.45]Okay, but if I... So I'm going to roll this for the five.
[141:36.03]Oh, fuck.
[141:36.23]Think about it.
[141:36.83]No, don't do that.
[141:38.13]Don't.
[141:38.59]Why?
[141:40.20]One, two, three, four, and then I reroll this.
[141:45.76]Boom.
[141:48.70]That's okay.
[141:49.75]Same.
[141:49.89]Alright, it's whatever.
[141:50.61]Small, straight...
[141:54.19]We both hit 15 on that.
[141:55.88]Okay.
[141:57.24]I gotta get us something big here.
[141:58.19]I mean, you're up by one point.
[142:04.97]I'm going for fours.
[142:10.61]That can change so quickly, though.
[142:12.38]Ooh.
[142:14.12]What?
[142:14.46]Going for the Yahtzee.
[142:15.84]Wait, you're not trying to say... Someone just said you're using your sabotage voice.
[142:19.57]Can you corrupt... Is that true?
[142:21.55]What's your sabotage voice?
[142:22.87]If I get a Yahtzee, we'll see.
[142:25.11]Oh, no.
[142:26.40]Yahtzee!
[142:30.24]Oh, my God.
[142:30.48]Are you kidding me?
[142:30.88]Are you kidding me?
[142:32.68]I've been played, haven't I?
[142:35.37]Totally played.
[142:36.73]Isn't this fun?
[142:39.91]This is fun.
[142:40.81]I love this.
[142:42.49]You know what?
[142:42.91]I can imagine us sitting around with our gin and tonics with a squeeze of lime in it.
[142:48.80]Yeah.
[142:49.30]But now you're sold on gin and tonic.
[142:51.03]Yeah, there we go.
[142:51.71]And then it's like, Yahtzee.
[142:52.89]We both turn around and go, Yahtzee.
[142:55.59]Y-A-H-T-Z-E.
[142:59.00]Right?
[143:00.24]Yeah, for sure.
[143:00.96]And it turns into a musical.
[143:03.77]Yahtzee.
[143:04.47]Okay.
[143:06.50]Hey, why am I shaking these?
[143:07.58]I fucked up.
[143:09.95]Oh, did you fuck it up?
[143:11.85]I fucked it up.
[143:13.13]No, what am I doing?
[143:14.01]I'm going for sixes.
[143:16.04]You gotta go big.
[143:17.08]Here we go.
[143:18.66]You could go big and you could get three sixes.
[143:22.70]Yarno, I am so freaking lucky because I hit shit like this.
[143:25.23]If you get a Yahtzee with sixes, I'm going to put my foot through my monitor.
[143:33.32]There's no way.
[143:33.88]Can you imagine?
[143:35.04]Can you imagine?
[143:36.17]I can, I can.
[143:37.72]Don't do it.
[143:39.25]Because I'll do it.
[143:41.26]Six.
[143:45.94]Hey, you know what, though?
[143:47.18]Hold on a second.
[143:47.94]Hold on a second.
[143:49.11]I can see us having... We're playing Yahtzee all around and sitting around saying, Yahtzee, having our gin and tonics together.
[144:00.87]You know what I mean?
[144:01.83]Yeah.
[144:02.69]But here's the thing.
[144:03.49]Here's the thing.
[144:05.49]Yahtzee is the same no matter what.
[144:07.20]It's 50 points.
[144:08.26]You could have done five.
[144:09.68]You could have done five sixes.
[144:13.14]Why did you wait to tell me that?
[144:15.27]I tried to tell you.
[144:15.97]I tried to stop you.
[144:16.77]Well, you did it.
[144:17.27]You did your sabotage voice.
[144:19.23]Oh, what's this?
[144:19.79]The chat was right.
[144:20.48]Time for me to go for it.
[144:25.06]You said, oh, well.
[144:26.46]Hmm.
[144:28.71]There is one little thing, Squeaks, you are not considering.
[144:31.79]That's what you said.
[144:33.12]Oh, well.
[144:41.34]Alright, give me one more six and I actually might win.
[144:45.19]Yo!
[144:46.67]That's a big deal.
[144:48.23]You're kidding me.
[144:49.41]That is a big deal.
[144:55.50]I got mogged.
[144:58.37]Come on.
[144:59.03]I got straight up mogged.
[145:00.75]I tried to tell you.
[145:03.76]You were doing like an evil villain monolog.
[145:05.94]It's not guaranteed that you will get another Yahtzee though.
[145:08.54]That's always the right call.
[145:11.36]Or maybe not.
[145:12.80]It's not guaranteed to get a Yahtzee.
[145:14.93]It's actually hard to get.
[145:17.73]Oh, true.
[145:18.81]Okay, perhaps I should go for threes, right?
[145:24.34]Whatever you think is going to be more in your favor.
[145:26.88]Or a straight two, three, four, five, six.
[145:31.83]Get rid of the three.
[145:32.95]Oh, my God.
[145:34.21]Two, three.
[145:34.65]You would need a four.
[145:36.85]I just have to hope for a four.
[145:38.50]If you get a four, that's a big deal.
[145:42.16]Come on, come on.
[145:43.84]Four.
[145:47.57]Okay.
[145:48.09]It's just a five.
[145:49.65]It's just a five.
[145:51.31]This time for sure.
[145:52.55]Come on.
[145:54.14]Four.
[146:01.91]Yep.
[146:05.15]You have anything to tell me?
[146:06.64]Does this seem alright?
[146:09.72]No, that's a good thing to do.
[146:12.31]I'll get I'll get one of those right now alright let's see it two three four oh excuse me are you serious two three five I need scripted I need a one or wait I need a one or a is that it oh yeah no wait hold on what's going on I need a one two three four you need a five I need a five how did I not know that

[146:51.96]Oh, a four.
[146:53.28]Nice try.
[146:56.80]I like this music.
[147:08.08]Feels like we're like watching the Rugrats.
[147:10.53]I'm taking a zero on the ones.
[147:13.06]I'm taking a zero on the ones.
[147:15.70]Wait, so do we have to go through all of the categories?
[147:18.28]You got to go through all of them.
[147:20.45]Okay, cool.
[147:21.21]Okay, now I'm going to go for the threes.
[147:30.48]Yeah, you can only get a four of a kind.
[147:35.24]Ones, twos, fours, or sixes.
[147:37.89]That's all you're looking for.
[147:41.95]You can use it for anything.
[147:43.12]I already have threes?
[147:44.72]You've done threes already.
[147:47.22]Oh.
[147:50.45]Oh, so I should go for four of a kind.
[147:53.35]Oh.
[147:53.43]Yes.
[147:54.71]But you have to mark something at the end of the turns, which could be zero.
[148:02.55]Stop sabotaging him.
[148:03.45]I just told him.
[148:04.27]I could have just sat there and just drank my drink and laughed at him.
[148:10.12]Okay, here we go.
[148:13.66]okay okay that could that could be what wins you the game because I took a zero boom oh shoot three points I need a big three I need a big four of a kind right now this could be okay huge wait hold on no
[148:40.87]I need... Do I just go for sixes for every kind?
[148:45.83]You can do it.
[148:46.37]I believe.
[148:49.06]Just do twos?
[148:49.88]I'm not smart enough to sabotage you.
[148:51.80]Two will go home.
[148:52.24]No, you can get six.
[148:53.30]Don't you see?
[148:53.88]Don't you believe in yourself?
[148:56.93]I do believe in myself.
[148:59.09]Try it, won't you?
[149:00.07]Try the six.
[149:02.06]I actually have to get this.
[149:03.52]Give in to the temptation.
[149:04.70]I actually have to get this.
[149:05.92]You can do it.
[149:07.24]You can do it.
[149:07.92]I need a two.
[149:10.08]I have to get it.
[149:19.13]Oh, I thought it was a two.
[149:20.23]Shoot.
[149:21.13]This is bad.
[149:21.63]This is a loss if I don't get a two.
[149:26.46]Oh, you stupid game.
[149:28.24]Why are you doing this?
[149:31.57]Someone check if there's a magnet in that dice.
[149:33.81]That looks so weird.
[149:34.47]Oh, no.
[149:35.01]This is bad.
[149:35.76]I have to mark the three as dog shit.
[149:38.59]Hmm.
[149:39.66]Shame.
[149:40.10]Take the eight points for the four.
[149:42.68]No, I got to mark the three.
[149:45.53]I'll take the fours.
[149:46.67]Two fours is, you're going to get more than two fours.
[149:51.46]Four is better.
[149:52.22]We'll get big threes.
[149:53.78]No, we'll take the three.
[149:56.36]Everyone's yelling at me.
[149:57.44]Three, three.
[149:58.17]Don't listen to them, Jeremiah.
[149:59.35]Play with your heart.
[150:03.38]Hey, why are you laughing?
[150:05.27]What?
[150:05.97]I'm not laughing.
[150:06.67]I just thought it was a funny joke.
[150:07.63]You still need your sixes, which could kill you the game.
[150:10.91]Wait, you're right.
[150:13.74]You know what?
[150:14.22]You know what's crazy?
[150:15.76]I also need fives.
[150:16.94]Oh, no, I have fives.
[150:19.61]What if I re-roll everything?
[150:21.33]You could do that.
[150:21.79]Oh, I need fours.
[150:22.59]I need fours.
[150:26.78]Mm-hmm.
[150:26.94]Roll those away.
[150:27.60]Try to go for the fours.
[150:28.96]But you're not going to get them.
[150:29.70]You just stay with two.
[150:30.72]Come on.
[150:31.46]Come on.
[150:32.18]Come on.
[150:34.91]That's alright.
[150:35.55]Okay.
[150:36.57]There's no way you're going to get four.
[150:37.73]It is not possible.
[150:39.59]You don't think it's possible?
[150:40.45]The gods are not going to let it happen.
[150:44.30]I'm blessed by God, gods, and science.
[150:47.74]Boom.
[150:49.00]We're good.
[150:53.27]Now you could take the two here if you want to try to go for more.
[150:56.75]You could take the two.
[150:59.47]Just saying.
[150:59.81]No, no.
[151:03.26]I'm going to go for the fours.
[151:05.48]Alright, I need something big here.
[151:07.63]Big four of a kind.
[151:11.55]Alright, one, two, three.
[151:12.69]I need a three.
[151:13.29]Wait.
[151:13.99]Six, five, four, three.
[151:15.52]I need a three.
[151:16.04]One, two.
[151:19.46]Oh, this is not a bad roll.
[151:23.01]I need six, five, four.
[151:24.81]I need a three.
[151:26.39]Give me a three.
[151:28.97]Okay.
[151:30.13]Come on.
[151:34.70]Oh, nice try.
[151:45.71]Take those fours.
[151:52.04]I'm not talking anymore.
[151:55.99]This is a. I still need a four of a kind and a straight.
[152:00.50]I need to still.
[152:01.02]Listen, I need sixes.
[152:03.12]You can win for sure.
[152:04.18]Yeah, you haven't gotten your sixes.
[152:06.02]This guy could still win.
[152:07.83]I know it's really bad.
[152:09.05]Do I go for twos?
[152:12.65]So bad.
[152:15.43]Hey, I get sixes as a four of a kind and that that could be GG.
[152:20.52]This is so bad.
[152:22.00]If this is this is my really screwy.
[152:27.34]I mean, I still have choice.
[152:29.66]You do still have choice.
[152:30.95]Damn it.
[152:31.47]That's right.
[152:33.11]You're in a much better position than I am.
[152:34.79]Okay.
[152:38.09]Dog shit, but I mean, that's fine.
[152:40.83]I could go for choice here.
[152:44.73]Eh, whatever.
[152:45.89]We're tied on twos.
[152:47.65]Alright, I need fives.
[152:53.93]Not quite.
[152:56.12]What do you do?
[152:57.24]I see when it comes down to the wire, you're kind of forced into taking it.
[153:00.54]It gets a little tricky.
[153:01.94]I have to go for fours.
[153:02.80]The further the game goes on.
[153:05.73]Wait, you mean four of a kind?
[153:07.69]Yeah, I gotta go for four of a kind fours.
[153:11.07]Yeah.

[153:18.58]That sucks.
[153:20.37]This is game over.
[153:21.69]This is game over.
[153:22.39]No, no, no.
[153:22.89]You can do it.
[153:23.41]You can do it.
[153:23.93]You can do it.
[153:25.32]No.
[153:31.19]No.
[153:39.08]Have you ever heard the saying, fuck my chungus life?
[153:43.59]Never say that again.
[153:47.21]You had the straight?
[153:48.33]What do you mean I had the straight?
[153:49.75]I didn't have the straight.
[153:52.47]Uh... Okay, hold on.
[153:53.84]Two fives?
[153:57.36]This sucks.
[153:59.50]I can go for four of a kind.
[154:02.20]Do I even have a win condition?
[154:04.33]If I get five... If I get six... If I get five six... If I get five fives...
[154:13.81]You had a large sprite and you rolled it?
[154:15.75]What?
[154:15.89]No, I didn't.
[154:18.41]That was one off the sprite.
[154:19.33]I had to go for the fourth.
[154:21.46]Oh my god!
[154:22.68]Let's freaking go!
[154:25.36]How do you exit the game?
[154:27.38]How do you?
[154:27.62]What's?
[154:27.90]The Xbox button's not working.
[154:32.12]Wait, hold on.
[154:32.54]It gets even better.
[154:33.21]You're not going to want to miss this one.
[154:34.39]Ooh.
[154:37.61]Oh, shit.
[154:38.89]Okay, I'm taking the sixes.
[154:41.81]Obvi.

[155:17.65]Well, that's a GG.
[155:20.23]That's sad.
[155:21.81]Well, at least go for points here.
[155:24.09]You've rolled some pretty crazy rolls.
[155:25.36]Let's see it.
[155:27.26]I need four of a kind.
[155:28.30]Or roll for the highest points.
[155:31.78]For the highest points?
[155:33.28]Yeah, let's do that, actually.
[155:34.41]I'm just going to get rid of... I'll keep this and this.
[155:38.75]And reroll everything else.
[155:39.65]You could get a monster choice.
[155:41.67]Oh, two, three, four, five, six.
[155:43.90]Wait, I have a large straight.
[155:45.16]You already did it.
[155:46.67]Oh, wait, hold on.
[155:49.66]Oh, yeah, I already have that.
[155:50.60]You already got it.
[155:51.10]Okay, then let's do that.
[155:52.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:54.20]This is sad.
[155:56.33]It's Yahtzee.
[155:58.19]Put out at a funeral.
[155:59.23]Oh, that's good.
[156:01.47]This is, like, really depressing.
[156:03.11]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[156:04.38]I'm actually so sad.
[156:05.98]I feel so sad right now.
[156:07.94]I read a comment of, like, how are they so bad?
[156:10.95]And we're talking about, like, baseball.
[156:14.71]They're just throwing dice in the air.
[156:18.21]Wow.
[156:18.83]This is so depressing.
[156:23.42]This ruined my evening.
[156:25.06]I'm going for fives.
[156:26.18]Let's go.
[156:26.70]Ooh.
[156:31.81]Okay.
[156:32.77]There we go.
[156:33.59]Kind of big.
[156:34.63]You can do it.
[156:39.24]Alright.
[156:39.54]Oh, shit.
[156:39.98]Wait.
[156:41.14]Whoa.
[156:41.32]Wait a second.
[156:41.92]Wait a second.
[156:43.10]Alright.
[156:48.01]Now we got to get four of a kind.
[156:49.47]Oh, my God.
[156:53.58]The sixes would be ones or sixes.
[156:55.36]The sixes would be great.
[157:00.77]Imagine.
[157:02.73]No, it would be cool.
[157:04.65]Three sixes in one roll.
[157:07.48]The frickin articles would go crazy.
[157:09.84]Oh, you almost had an article.
[157:12.98]Not quite.
[157:14.23]Not quite.
[157:16.87]Close.
[157:18.05]Hey, congratulations on your first game ever of Yahtzee.
[157:22.26]Let's freaking go.
[157:23.36]That was what a rush.
[157:24.48]My heart is racing.
[157:26.17]I wouldn't have played it with anyone else.
[157:28.27]What a dream.
[157:29.43]Yahtzee.
[157:30.87]That was a great game.
[157:31.96]Alright.
[157:32.20]So it's been three hours.
[157:34.08]You ready to play the second game?
[157:38.55]I'm absolutely ready.
[157:39.41]At this rate, we'll be doing like a 62-hour stream here.
[157:42.80]Alright.
[157:44.34]I got maybe Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
[157:48.55]Let's do it.
[157:49.05]Right?
[157:51.67]Yeah, let's do it.
[157:52.55]I'm down.
[157:52.97]Alright, let's go.
[157:55.00]So this one I have played like two years ago.
[157:58.34]I think I played this and got mad at it and stopped and never played it ever again.
[158:03.09]Okay, that was my experience with it too.
[158:05.39]So maybe playing against another person is fun.
[158:08.05]Yeah, it'll be fun.
[158:09.15]I think the playing it online is very particularly frustrating in the most fun way possible.
[158:16.98]Really?
[158:18.18]Yes, because it like is a little laggy, but yeah, it'll be fun.
[158:22.99]It'll be really fun.
[158:24.45]That's the charm of it, Jerma.
[158:26.35]This person just doesn't is just doing a fucking like League of Legends move and just hitting everybody.
[158:33.20]Are you watching the beginning?
[158:35.50]Yeah, I'm going to watch the intro.
[158:37.28]Okay, me too.
[158:37.90]Should we have the Joy-Cons for this?
[158:40.93]Yes.
[158:41.53]Okay.
[158:53.88]Shit.
[158:54.00]I pulled it out of the dock.
[158:56.80]What?
[158:57.82]What?
[158:58.88]When you tried to take the Joy-Cons out?
[159:00.37]Yeah.
[159:06.33]Get off.
[159:15.77]I gotta change my grip order, hold on.
[159:18.33]You're good.
[159:31.53]I just exited the game.
[159:33.09]Wait, no, whoops.
[159:40.38]What's going on?
[159:41.84]Okay, wait, I do remember like four of the games work.
[159:46.21]Wait, the games don't work?
[159:48.25]I think some of them do not work.
[159:50.40]But we'll figure out which ones those are.
[159:51.78]No worries, no worries.
[159:56.82]This is loud.
[160:04.61]Alright, you can YouTube the intro.
[160:09.20]I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about everybody else.
[160:11.54]I actually skipped the intro when you said that.
[160:15.10]Like, I just listened.
[160:16.92]I just hit A. It just ruined the vibe completely.
[160:19.27]Like, I was so into it.
[160:23.39]Like, my heart was racing.
[160:24.88]Okay, I picked United States.
[160:29.26]So, choose how you want to play on this screen.
[160:33.49]Alright, online play.
[160:35.55]Yep.
[160:36.13]Is there, like, a lobby code that we don't want to leak or something?
[160:39.17]I'm not sure here I'll try to ranked match oh wait play the various events people from around the world I think we should do ranked right I think it's got to be like free play right can we do like a play with just you uh select an event to play online yeah there's got to be a way maybe it is just free play
[161:08.83]because I can't imagine you can do ranked free match free match and then I guess I select an event 100 meter dash oh gather in rooms and compete in various events okay maybe this one let's do gather and play and then I can create a room I don't want to leak the code alright friends only two players is there a code I can leak
[161:38.04]I'm just hiding my screen just in case.
[161:41.25]Oh, I see your room.
[161:42.09]You see me?
[161:43.39]Yeah.
[161:44.37]I don't think there's a code.
[161:45.10]Maybe there is.
[161:45.52]Alright.
[161:46.80]Let's do room settings.
[161:47.60]Hold on.
[161:47.88]I clicked A and my whole screen is frozen.
[161:50.10]Oh, I'm in.
[161:51.13]There you are.
[161:51.51]Alright.
[161:52.83]So how do we pick?
[161:54.43]Okay.
[161:54.71]So how do we pick?
[161:58.48]I just hit ready.
[162:00.34]I just hit ready.
[162:01.58]What event are we doing?
[162:04.13]Oh, here we go.
[162:05.69]We can vote.
[162:06.40]What do you want to do first?
[162:07.72]Let's do 100 meter dash.
[162:10.82]Yeah.
[162:12.39]Let's do it.
[162:12.95]I had to do the 100 meter dash in high school.
[162:16.49]Dual controllers?
[162:17.89]Yeah, let's do a dual.
[162:22.28]Do you just have to go like this?
[162:24.68]I think you just have to...
[162:26.90]I'm not even kidding you, Jeremiah.
[162:28.16]I mean, you just have to, like, swing the controller.
[162:30.02]It'll go over the instructions.
[162:32.32]I don't have wrist straps, by the way.
[162:33.95]We're going fucking... Oh, me neither.
[162:35.85]I'm freaking wrist strapless.
[162:37.91]I'm freaking ready.
[162:39.51]Oh, okay, so I can play as any character?
[162:41.62]Yeah, go ahead.
[162:44.74]Who's your main?
[162:47.38]I'm not going to tell you.
[162:48.23]I'm counterpicking.
[162:50.95]Should I be the big crocodile?
[162:54.35]I'm just saying it's a big mistake.
[162:56.40]It's on a meta pick for sure.
[162:58.06]I'm going to be Dr. Eggman.
[163:01.18]Sonic is the fastest character, so... Is Sonic actually fast?
[163:08.20]I don't know.
[163:08.92]I have no clue.
[163:10.52]I have no idea.
[163:11.46]I'm going to bump my microphone.
[163:12.73]I'm going to punch everybody in the face.
[163:15.07]Okay, hold the Joy-Con.
[163:17.77]Like that?
[163:21.13]How do you play?
[163:22.33]So you hold them like this and then, oh, how to play.
[163:25.20]Oh, here we go.
[163:25.52]Controls.
[163:27.74]Hold the Joy-Cons horizontally to charge power.
[163:31.16]Swing up at go and start running.
[163:33.16]What?
[163:36.33]So you do go like this.
[163:39.49]It's like we're milking a cow.
[163:42.55]What the fuck is this?
[163:43.01]So you got to go like that and then you go boom.
[163:45.79]Like swinging and then thrust forward.
[163:48.84]Okay.
[163:48.96]I don't understand.
[163:49.80]Okay, that's fine.
[163:50.56]Let's go.
[163:51.83]Alright.
[163:54.07]I gotta move this mic out of the way.
[163:56.54]Okay.
[163:57.14]Joyce?
[163:57.66]I don't- just standing is so... stupid.
[164:00.56]I don't- can anybody hear me still?
[164:02.59]On your marks!
[164:12.50]I can hear you.
[164:12.82]Ready!
[164:12.96]Go!
[164:13.08]Go!
[164:16.89]Dr. Robotnik is not any- no way.
[164:34.23]Dude, we gotta see that fucking replay.
[164:37.05]That was a photo finish.
[164:39.39]Somebody check the shoes.
[164:41.77]Oh my god.
[164:42.69]Wait, how?
[164:44.90]Would you do differently?
[164:47.16]Why are we so out of breath?
[164:49.69]Dude, I swear to God, my back hurts.
[164:52.15]Oh my God.
[164:52.83]Wait, were you standing up?
[164:55.99]No, I was sitting.
[164:57.88]We need a drug test on this guy.
[165:01.04]I don't trust that.
[165:01.78]There's no way that was a freaking premiere performance.
[165:06.35]That's it?
[165:06.79]You get the gold medal just like that?
[165:08.39]We're playing again.
[165:09.27]Do you want to do that one again?
[165:10.89]Oh, 100%.
[165:12.76]I'm gonna have to go to the doctor after this.
[165:17.07]I'm ready.
[165:18.21]I told you it's sports day.
[165:19.19]We have to be ready to sweat.
[165:20.45]I'm ready.
[165:23.29]Okay.
[165:23.41]Now let me dehydrate the fuck out of myself by drinking coffee.
[165:27.10]Out of your large aluminum cup.
[165:29.72]That we can all hear.
[165:31.17]Okay, I'm ready.
[165:44.89]Why did I just stop?
[165:47.07]Wait, did I win?
[165:47.77]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[165:50.38]Oh my god, did I win?
[165:51.40]I was so close.
[165:53.56]Did I win?
[165:53.90]Yes.
[165:55.04]Yes, I won by .7.
[165:57.13]One second.
[165:59.47]That's what I'm talking about.
[166:01.91]Sonic wins again.
[166:03.07]Dude, that little twirl I did at the end was fucked up.
[166:07.93]Is that like an early celebration?
[166:09.57]I don't get it.
[166:10.29]Yeah, why is he celebrating?
[166:11.61]I don't know.
[166:14.29]There's no way that's your boost.
[166:16.12]Okay.
[166:16.24]Alright.
[166:22.97]I'm ready.
[166:24.27]Okay.
[166:24.89]I'm ready.
[166:25.23]I'm ready.
[166:25.49]I'm ready.
[166:27.67]I moved around a little too much.
[166:30.38]I'm tired.
[166:32.62]Okay.
[166:33.00]I'm good.
[166:33.56]Okay.
[166:34.42]Yep.
[166:36.30]We're just waiting for other players.
[166:40.49]Did anybody hear that?
[166:42.58]I just burped into the mic.
[166:43.52]I'm sorry.
[166:44.79]Yeah, I heard that.
[166:47.18]It's probably because I'm sore from going to the gym today.
[166:50.65]Alright.
[167:06.13]Oh, my God.
[167:07.15]Unbelievable.
[167:08.11]Unbelievable.
[167:09.70]What just happened?
[167:10.44]The boost was perfect.
[167:16.55]Oh, my God.
[167:17.23]We both got really fast.
[167:19.34]Shit.
[167:19.92]Oh, my God.
[167:21.55]Somebody check Sonic's- sorry, somebody check Sonic's shoes.
[167:24.70]I can't even talk shit, I'm 40.
[167:33.07]Somebody check Sonic's- someone check Sonic's shoes.
[167:38.62]Something's happening.
[167:40.84]Oh my god.
[167:43.16]Oh, good game.
[167:45.41]Alright, you ready?
[167:46.29]For the next one?
[167:47.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[167:49.36]Maybe there's something like we can sit down and play Yahtzee in this game.
[167:53.06]Wait, somebody check this out.
[167:57.23]Return to room.
[167:58.25]We got like 50 other games in here to play.
[168:00.97]Yeah, this is game two, Jerma, of like 15.
[168:04.96]Which we both downloaded, by the way.
[168:07.28]Yeah, we both have, I think, 12 different video games.
[168:11.61]At least.
[168:12.65]Oh, man.
[168:13.53]Okay, I'm ready.
[168:14.57]Let's go.
[168:15.17]Let's do it.
[168:16.61]That was a good one.
[168:17.86]I feel like that took a lot of skill.
[168:20.12]It actually did.
[168:20.97]You have to decide when to dash.
[168:22.51]There's hurdles.
[168:23.73]Do we dare?
[168:26.07]What about triple jump?
[168:29.29]Okay, well.
[168:29.79]Skateboarding?
[168:32.42]What about canoe?
[168:34.58]Just a thought.
[168:35.30]Oh, we got to do disk throw.
[168:37.08]What is dream karate?
[168:39.28]Yeah, what is dream karate?
[168:41.61]Alright, let's do disk throw.
[168:42.49]No.
[168:43.67]Oh, okay.
[168:44.67]We'll do dream karate after.
[168:46.73]Okay, I'm ready.
[168:49.32]Oh, I know the climbing one's pretty fun.
[168:53.82]What?
[168:54.10]Time ran out?
[168:55.03]Oh, we get solo Ramon.
[169:02.22]Okay.
[169:05.30]Oh, man.
[169:07.30]We don't have to spin around in the room to do this, right?
[169:10.69]I don't know.
[169:11.71]I don't think so.
[169:14.55]I don't have the switch strap, by the way.
[169:16.91]Sorry.
[169:17.05]I know some people are mad.
[169:18.43]07.
[169:19.05]07 monitor.
[169:22.52]We're going to get that out of control.
[169:25.70]Hold the Joy-Con so you can press L and R. Like, I don't want to win that bad.
[169:30.51]I'm going to chuck this into my monitor.
[169:33.07]No, I think just the outermost button.
[169:36.65]Okay.
[169:37.15]Oh, my God.
[169:37.53]I hit next.
[169:39.32]Alright.
[169:39.54]How to play?
[169:41.50]Wait, how do you play, Jeremiah?
[169:42.72]I can't go back.
[169:43.84]Okay, hold the Joy-Con up close to your left shoulder.
[169:46.58]Then hold R to take your stance and get ready.
[169:50.19]Okay.
[169:51.25]Okay.
[169:52.39]While holding R, slowly swing the Joy-Con to your right and back to charge the power gauge.
[169:57.46]Then you bring it back.
[169:59.42]Okay.
[169:59.92]The power gauge is hidden.
[170:03.10]Then swing the Joy-Con up diagonally to throw... You can't read the instructions?
[170:09.77]Alright, hold on.
[170:10.67]I gotta move my...
[170:12.70]Wait, why do I have to go first?
[170:15.96]I don't get it.
[170:17.20]Wait, am I going first?
[170:18.35]It looks like Eggman, right?
[170:19.47]I'm Sonic.
[170:21.77]Wait.
[170:22.03]Oh, this is practice.
[170:23.47]Find the best position, then press this to compete.
[170:31.00]What the hell did we do?
[170:32.60]This is... Wait, what?
[170:36.95]Wait.
[170:37.43]Get ready.
[170:39.29]That was horrible.
[170:42.60]Oh, like a frisbee.
[170:47.25]Okay.
[170:49.13]Should I go?
[170:49.81]I don't understand.
[170:52.35]Yeah, I think I'm ready.
[170:54.10]Alright.
[170:54.78]Remember what you practiced in the throw.
[170:59.80]This game sucks.
[171:02.74]What the hell was that?
[171:04.79]It's not like accurate.
[171:06.19]I feel like it's not my throw at all.
[171:10.87]Alright.
[171:11.15]Beat that, Jerma.
[171:12.81]Yeah, right.
[171:13.77]Did you get more than zero?
[171:17.04]Oh my god.
[171:17.44]Wait.
[171:17.60]We're going at the same time.
[171:20.47]I got 22.
[171:21.57]How did you not get... I got zero.
[171:25.71]I held R and then just like swung my hand and let go.
[171:31.00]Wait, how did you get zero?
[171:36.40]Oh, that's gonna be... That's gonna be good.
[171:39.49]Oh my god, I got perfect.
[171:46.59]These are not for real?
[171:52.93]I don't understand.
[171:54.52]I just did so well for some reason.
[171:57.14]Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.
[172:04.33]This game is so bad.
[172:07.61]I don't get it.
[172:08.36]I was just saying, waiting for other players.
[172:15.00]I got 37.
[172:17.33]Oh my god.
[172:18.74]41.
[172:19.72]What the hell?
[172:21.16]I don't get it.
[172:22.92]I did the same swing as the first time, but it just said perfect.
[172:29.63]How did you get two or three more points than I did?
[172:32.55]I don't know.
[172:34.19]I don't know.
[172:34.99]I guess I am pretty athletic.
[172:38.57]I am.
[172:38.73]You want to do another one?
[172:40.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[172:42.96]I like it.
[172:44.12]I think we got to rapid fire these ones, I think.
[172:47.24]For sure, for sure.
[172:49.67]Don't strain your deteriorating body.
[172:53.09]Why do you think it's deteriorating?
[172:55.62]Yeah, hey, come on.
[172:57.12]This body's not deteriorating.
[173:00.40]Are you like a big gym guy?

[175:32.91]Oh, I thought you were- I thought you were way ahead.
[175:42.66]I thought you were- I didn't even understand what we had to do!
[175:46.06]I think you have to, like, shake the controller with your teammate.
[175:52.09]Let's be in the same paddle.
[175:53.89]You're so ahead.
[175:55.84]Wait, no, let's be in the same paddle.
[175:57.36]This one might be fun.
[175:58.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[176:00.50]With our forces combined.
[176:01.94]Let's be return to room.
[176:06.31]Yeah.

[176:13.25]I actually am sweating.
[176:17.25]Yeah, me too.
[176:17.53]Like, actually.
[176:18.72]So Squeaks, I do... That's just the updating tracking data?
[176:22.38]What, are they tracking us?
[176:24.41]When the host is ready, the game will advance to the event setting.
[176:27.17]Only the host can change the room setting.
[176:30.75]Uh-oh.
[176:31.76]They're tracking us.
[176:33.86]Yeah, Mario and Sonic devs are still checking.
[176:36.86]By the way, 2020.
[176:38.47]2020.
[176:39.83]They are.
[176:40.31]They have just an absolute insane amount of data.
[176:46.22]They're clicking canoe in 2025.
[176:47.88]Alright, so here's the thing.
[176:50.84]Yeah?
[176:52.84]So we've got like 15 Switch games.
[176:55.99]Yeah.
[176:57.17]We're definitely not going to get through all of them in the next two to three hours.
[177:00.86]Right.
[177:01.32]How long do you want to play?
[177:02.14]How long are you here for?
[177:03.10]What's your schedule?

[177:22.22]Yeah, same.
[177:23.68]Besides that, hey, we could be Switch best friends.
[177:27.56]We could do this again.
[177:29.02]Let's do it.
[177:30.67]Yeah, I'm down.
[177:31.99]Switch Sundays, but on Monday.
[177:37.40]Switch Sundays.
[177:40.29]Don't stamp that, though, because we're probably not going to play this for, like, three months.
[177:42.95]Yeah, for, like, months and months.
[177:46.38]It's Sunday.
[177:47.30]What's happening?
[177:48.20]Hey, what's going on?

[178:49.38]How did we lose by once?
[178:50.42]We almost just did it.
[178:52.18]We have to try again.
[178:53.30]We can do it.
[178:54.44]Okay, okay, okay.
[178:55.20]We cannot leave unless we win.
[178:56.63]We can't leave this until we win.
[178:59.07]Okay, deal.
[178:59.61]Do you want to just shake the controller the whole time?
[179:03.21]No, no, we have to shake it at the end.
[179:05.06]Like, at the end, there's, like, the last sprint where you just, like, for some reason, they just, like, throw the rules in the air and they're like, just shake.
[179:12.76]Alright.
[179:13.08]Last freaking sprint.
[179:14.31]I will go to my tempo, okay?
[179:17.03]Okay, you'll be the shot caller this time.

[180:06.70]Alright.
[180:08.17]One.
[180:08.73]One.
[180:08.91]One.
[180:10.81]One.
[180:11.13]Shake, shake, shake, shake.
[180:15.20]I don't think we're ever going to beat this.
[180:18.37]Alright.
[180:18.55]Go on your own timer.
[180:19.27]You can't say I'm taking a break.
[180:20.50]We can't say you can't say I'm taking a break in the middle of the water.
[180:25.07]You had to turn a competition.
[180:27.33]I'm taking a break.
[180:28.25]Hey, man, I know we've been training for three years for this, but hey, I got to take a quick break.
[180:33.76]And before the freaking starting line, your shot caller goes... Get up.
[180:41.25]I'm going to just turn around and just swing and hit you in the face with the oar.
[180:46.42]Alright, let's go.
[180:48.00]Alright, I'm ready.
[180:48.48]I'm ready.
[180:49.56]Okay, I'll try shotcalling.
[180:52.04]It's just going to be super simple.
[180:55.83]Okay.
[180:57.13]Okay.
[180:58.31]No, we're not doing the music shit.
[181:05.62]No more music shit.
[181:07.13]Just when your guy lifts his hand up.
[181:10.45]Okay, okay.
[181:15.56]Hey, careful!
[181:16.44]What are they doing?
[181:16.97]They're drunk!
[181:21.39]Chicken tonic!
[181:35.56]Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[181:50.24]How do you beat them?
[181:52.70]How do you beat them?
[181:54.30]This is impossible.
[181:55.34]I don't get it.
[181:56.61]I don't get it.
[181:57.47]It's impossible.
[181:59.91]You said we have to beat them, Jerma.
[182:03.74]Alright.
[182:05.43]Wait, should we do it?
[182:06.21]This is the inaugural Switch Sunday once every three or four months.
[182:10.73]That's true.
[182:11.15]That's right.
[182:11.96]Alright.
[182:12.24]So here's my strategy.
[182:14.62]Yeah.
[182:14.90]I think we're doing it.
[182:15.72]We're taking too long between does.
[182:18.33]So.
[182:18.89]Okay.
[182:19.61]Oh, wait.
[182:19.83]Somebody said we could do alternate.
[182:21.11]So what if it's like you go, I go, you go, I go, you go, I go.
[182:25.60]I don't think we can do alternate.
[182:27.24]I think we can.
[182:27.86]That's a sabotage.
[182:28.72]That's a sabotage chat.
[182:31.40]That's one guy?
[182:32.02]That's his sabotage.
[182:32.88]Alright, but what if it's like one, one, one, one, one?
[182:37.45]We can do that, right?
[182:38.55]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182:39.85]Like a metronome?
[182:40.85]Yeah, just dun, dun, dun, dun.
[182:43.26]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[182:45.20]Okay, I'm going to play that in my head.
[182:47.08]So just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[182:50.46]Okay.
[182:56.83]Ready?
[183:04.86]Shake shake shake shake!
[183:31.66]That's it.
[183:31.98]That's the one.
[183:32.38]We got it.
[183:33.36]We're so good.
[183:34.90]Let's freaking go.
[183:37.61]All we had to do is shut the fuck up.
[183:41.09]And don't go.
[183:47.04]We destroyed them.
[183:47.60]We decimated them.
[183:48.86]We destroyed them.
[183:49.54]Annihilated.
[183:50.20]Not even close.
[183:51.79]Oh my God.
[183:52.95]It's too easy.
[183:54.61]I'm ready for the real Olympics.
[183:58.09]Oh yeah.
[183:58.67]We got it.
[184:00.00]That might be the world record.
[184:04.35]Alright, what else is even in this game?
[184:08.07]Just a bunch of shit like that.
[184:11.11]Like it's like the same game, we're just shaking the controller and hoping it inputs.
[184:17.18]And just trying not to strain our backs.
[184:19.78]Dude, I threw my back out on the first one, I'm not even kidding.
[184:22.61]I feel bad, I mean you also, I thought you got seriously injured during bowling.
[184:31.02]I got, I was seriously injured.
[184:34.62]I just heard a crack.
[184:37.51]But it was probably just the Discord or something.
[184:39.97]It was me throwing the controller.
[184:42.73]Alright, what about... Do the surfing?
[184:45.90]Oh, we gotta do the gymnastics.
[184:49.46]Are you kidding me?
[184:51.60]Oh, yeah.
[184:52.03]Let's do gymnastics.
[184:53.09]Also, I'm pretty sure I remember badminton being really good.
[184:56.39]Okay.
[184:58.01]Has it already been an hour?
[185:00.66]Of this game?
[185:01.74]Have we been playing this for an hour?
[185:04.17]You're kidding.
[185:05.05]Oh, my God.
[185:07.95]Well, I'm taking a break in about two minutes.
[185:11.32]So you better do something good.
[185:14.28]Alright, gymnastics.
[185:16.38]I'm going to be Super Mario for this.
[185:21.51]I wouldn't.
[185:21.95]Bowser, 100%.
[185:23.87]I'll be Yoshi.
[185:26.30]Did you do a good Bowser impression?
[185:29.20]You could have just said no.
[185:36.05]Sorry, I'm just kidding.
[185:40.89]Alright, we got one minute.

[185:51.00]Yeah, yeah.

[192:54.46]I should do them.
[192:55.42]I feel so rejuvenated.
[192:58.15]It gives you an opportunity to get up, move around.
[193:00.45]I mean, I've been trying to do more of that.
[193:02.28]Instead of sitting for an hour straight, I just try to get up for a minute or two.
[193:06.86]Yeah.
[193:07.48]Wait, I get it.
[193:08.46]It's nice.
[193:09.13]You get coffee.
[193:10.01]You get water.
[193:11.49]Stretch your legs.
[193:13.43]It's good.
[193:14.19]I like it.
[193:15.14]Let's get some water.
[193:17.46]Okay, you ready for some gymnastics?
[193:20.86]Yeah, for real.
[193:22.35]For real.
[193:24.71]Yeah, let's do gymnastics.
[193:25.39]You dressed to sweat now?
[193:26.21]We got all the sports ones ready.
[193:28.07]I am wearing shorts today.
[193:31.14]I'm not.
[193:32.58]What are you, in jeans?
[193:33.36]I feel so underprepared.
[193:35.36]No, I'm in sweatpants.
[193:38.83]That's alright.
[193:41.29]Yeah, I'm definitely not ready to sweat, but that's alright.
[193:45.81]Okay, we doing gymnastics again?
[193:47.99]We are.
[193:48.77]You're going to get schooled.
[193:52.24]Okay.
[193:53.98]I'm on.
[193:54.46]I think last time you got a 10.
[193:57.40]10.6?
[193:58.76]Yeah, but that didn't count.
[194:00.27]Hey, can you juggle the Joy-Cons?
[194:02.69]Yeah, sure.
[194:05.59]We don't have time.
[194:06.25]Yeah, right.
[194:06.95]Yeah, right.
[194:07.55]You can juggle the Joy-Cons.
[194:08.42]We don't got time.
[194:10.36]What do you mean?
[194:11.08]It takes two seconds.
[194:12.52]We don't got time.
[194:14.11]We don't have time for you to juggle the Joy-Cons.
[194:15.89]I want to be prepared for this.
[194:18.65]I think you're lying.
[194:20.16]Oh, what's a good team?
[194:21.34]About Knuckles?
[194:23.22]Oh no, it's not teams.
[194:24.04]We're not doing Rowan again.
[194:27.33]Wait, what is my controller paired to?
[194:31.77]Oh dude, you're on my Switch!
[194:33.79]Wait, what the hell?
[194:34.61]What the hell?
[194:35.68]Wait, I swear it's... Are you pairing to like a neighbor's house?
[194:40.56]I don't know.
[194:42.93]Oh yeah, it was just one.
[194:45.28]Were you doing two?
[194:46.46]Yeah, well I was confused.
[194:49.08]That's probably why I lost.
[194:52.63]I'm so confused.
[194:53.89]Okay, now I get it.
[194:54.63]Now I'm gonna get a 10 out of 10.
[194:55.58]Good luck.
[194:58.94]Timing is everything.
[195:02.41]A.
[195:13.29]So, Jerma, what's your, like, ideal lunch?
[195:16.53]Well, you know... What is your voice?
[195:25.68]Oh, well.
[195:29.13]My controller's... Oh, my God.
[195:33.77]My controller's broken.
[195:37.32]Don't stop.
[195:38.44]I hate that that works.
[195:58.62]Beat that.
[196:01.74]I think you won.
[196:05.34]What'd you get?
[196:05.91]7.6.
[196:07.49]That's pretty good.
[196:11.21]What'd you get?
[196:12.90]You have to hit next.
[196:22.17]Did somebody settle this prayer?
[196:25.43]What?
[196:27.49]It's 14?
[196:27.93]I thought I won.
[196:28.73]I got a 12.
[196:29.98]I was so excited.
[196:33.26]I wasn't ready to get so excited.
[196:36.55]Dang it.
[196:41.73]You want to go for one more?
[196:43.47]Are you celebrating by drinking your cold brew or whatever?
[196:47.23]What I've been doing is I've been putting water into that.
[196:51.40]I've been slowly diluting that until it is a homeopathic coffee at this point.
[196:58.98]It was an iced coffee four hours ago, and I keep putting water into the ice.
[197:06.73]It may as well be homeopathic.
[197:09.59]So now it's just water flavored with like brown.
[197:12.42]It's water that is coffee that has been diluted so many times that it's almost like not even detectable.
[197:18.58]Ew.
[197:19.83]Now it's like ice with a side of coffee.
[197:22.93]Ew.
[197:23.55]Horrifying for some reason.
[197:25.55]Alright, let's do it again.
[197:26.19]Disgusting.
[197:27.46]You want to do gymnastics again?
[197:29.00]Yeah.
[197:29.18]This is the finale.
[197:30.02]Best of three.
[197:30.78]Finale.
[197:31.18]Best of three.
[197:31.56]Well, I've won two of them, so.
[197:33.66]Well, the first one didn't count.
[197:34.89]That's true.
[197:35.39]Because ads are running.
[197:38.03]True.
[197:38.15]Okay.
[197:38.35]This is the finale.
[197:39.03]Good luck.
[197:40.81]Okay.
[197:41.25]I'm actually going to start trying now.
[197:42.21]I thought you muted your microphone.
[197:44.81]No.
[197:46.02]Of course not.
[197:50.32]Don't want to have to do this.
[197:59.67]Why does that miss?
[198:08.24]Why does that miss?
[198:14.29]I can't do it.
[198:34.28]I'm faltering.
[198:42.31]Yeah.
[198:57.20]Knock knock knock.
[198:58.45]How are you?
[199:00.93]I feel so silly.
[199:02.65]What'd you get?
[199:03.09]I got a six point.
[199:05.02]You didn't.
[199:06.40]You obviously didn't get a six.
[199:08.32]You wouldn't go knock knock knock.
[199:10.37]That's true.
[199:11.43]Yeah, you don't start with a knock knock knock if you're not happy.
[199:15.93]No, nobody happily knocks.
[199:19.44]I got a 9.4.
[199:24.05]I messed up big time.
[199:26.40]I don't understand this one.
[199:29.28]Yeah, of course you like it.
[199:30.18]You're winning.
[199:30.98]How many spins are you doing in the final round?
[199:34.48]Like 14.
[199:35.03]Okay.
[199:36.53]So you got it.
[199:37.95]Well, this one I didn't even unlock spins because it was such a bad performance.
[199:41.99]Oh.
[199:43.56]Yeah.
[199:46.04]Okay, let's skip.
[199:47.42]Gymnastics sucks for me.
[199:49.48]That's just not my sport.
[199:50.36]Congratulations.
[199:52.39]Can you guys see it?
[199:52.93]You win gymnastics.
[199:57.09]It's fucking disgusting in there.
[199:59.80]Wait, your coffee?
[200:00.48]I wanna see.
[200:02.68]Wait, hold it up again?
[200:10.24]Here.
[200:10.36]How did I just pour that on my speakers?
[200:12.48]That was stupid.
[200:14.73]Well, that's not good.
[200:15.43]Hopefully I didn't fuck it up.
[200:20.82]Alright, let me skip.
[200:21.46]You want to get a good look?
[200:23.08]Yeah, I want to get a good look.
[200:24.32]I hear it, but I don't see it.
[200:26.27]See it?
[200:27.61]Oh, I don't see any coffee in there.
[200:30.49]Why are you diluting it?
[200:32.07]Why not just get a fresh cup?
[200:34.44]Can you see it?
[200:36.14]Yeah, it just looks like water.
[200:39.74]Now, there's some dark liquid in there.
[200:42.41]It is kind of gray, isn't it?
[200:45.73]It is gray.
[200:46.93]Oh, man.
[200:49.93]Why?
[200:50.39]Try it.
[200:54.77]Dishwater.
[200:57.12]Ooh.
[200:58.26]That's a little kick.
[201:03.12]That's pool water.
[201:04.27]You're polluting your own pool water.
[201:05.85]This is like an allegory.
[201:06.93]It all links together.
[201:07.83]It all links.
[201:10.57]Don't you see?
[201:11.15]Now I get it.
[201:13.34]So I put a little bit of water in my coffee.
[201:16.46]I made an Americano, actually.
[201:20.10]That's not an Americano.
[201:21.88]That's it's obviously women.
[201:24.95]It's pollution.
[201:26.73]Oh Yeah, let's do badminton.
[201:29.11]Oh shit.
[201:29.43]I did swimming Okay.
[201:31.35]Well, we'll see singles.
[201:35.56]Oh It's gonna randomly choose Yes, alright This is a single Yeah, good luck Who would be good at shoes?
[201:48.96]I feel like Tails would be really good at Batman.
[201:51.16]I feel like this is a Peach game.
[201:52.20]I feel like this is a Peach would excel.
[201:55.80]Oh, you're so right.
[202:04.05]Okay, good luck.
[202:04.99]Okay, so you can press this button.
[202:12.80]Hold the controller and press this.
[202:15.24]Okay.
[202:21.27]Uh, that's the only instruction?
[202:24.62]Surely not, right?
[202:27.66]How come you get instructions?
[202:31.07]So you swing, and then you can move around with the stick.
[202:36.37]You will automatically move to it.
[202:39.06]It's swing with the shuttlecock, or whatever the fuck this thing is.
[202:42.38]The joycock.
[202:43.12]I don't even know what this thing is.
[202:44.04]Whatever it is.

[202:58.25]Oh.
[203:00.78]Oh, here we go.
[203:01.38]I don't even know how you did that.
[203:02.40]I don't know either.
[203:04.02]I'm just swinging around.
[203:10.53]Wait, this one takes... Are you just spamming?

[204:04.78]Oh, you killed me.
[204:06.81]You killed Tails.
[204:08.27]You murdered me.
[204:09.69]Good.
[204:11.53]How dare you?
[204:16.98]Oh, man.
[204:18.34]I'm not good at this.
[204:19.41]How are you randomly like so good at these games?
[204:23.05]Oh, but you forgot about my secret move.
[204:26.50]Yeah.
[204:32.14]I'd rather go to the dentist than lose.
[204:35.09]I'd rather just go to the dentist I need to go to the dentist it's been a while I do too for real are you a flosser be honest no me neither I I'm a flosser an hour before the dentist to prove that I didn't but they can see right through it I always have a condescending dentist though they always make me feel so bad they're like oh have you ever brushed your teeth
[205:00.42]Like, I've never heard of a toothpaste before, you piece of shit.
[205:05.01]Like, Jesus.
[205:06.49]Yeah, I... Dude, I used to lie to the dentist and say that I chewed Trident gum.
[205:12.86]Because I heard that it... Because I was on a commercial, and the commercial said, Trident, chew Trident, four out of five dentists recommend, whatever it said, right?
[205:20.08]And I would lie to the dentist and say, Oh, how are you taking care of your teeth?
[205:24.45]Yeah, yeah, I'm chewing Trident gum.
[205:27.16]Because the commercial said that, and they just kind of laughed.
[205:29.82]They were like, oh, wow, okay.
[205:31.98]You think maybe they were the one of five?
[205:34.61]I say keep going for it, Jeremiah.
[205:36.19]I think you're just getting unlucky.
[205:37.75]I think certainly one time there's going to be a dentist that's going to be like, wow, damn, that's really good.
[205:44.28]Thank God you're taking care of your teeth.
[205:46.06]It's so funny that they do that.
[205:47.02]The four out of five dentists recommend this.
[205:48.83]What is the fifth dentist?
[205:50.37]What is his deal?
[205:52.87]He's just like, he has a, he just doesn't fuck with tried and come.
[205:56.11]He just hates it.
[205:57.04]Oh, four out of five dents recommend this toothpaste.
[205:58.76]Why does that guy, does that guy just not recommend that?
[206:00.70]Why?
[206:03.09]Yeah.
[206:03.57]No, no, don't put that, don't put that shit in your mouth.
[206:07.31]Yeah, but that dent is fucking, that dent is sucks.
[206:10.20]Alright, what are we doing?
[206:11.04]No one likes the fifth one.
[206:12.90]Um.
[206:13.06]Swimming?
[206:14.02]Oh.
[206:17.84]Oh my God.
[206:18.40]Watch it be discus throw.
[206:20.73]Just quit, quit, quit.
[206:22.51]We just quit.
[206:24.89]How do we quit?
[206:26.19]We can't quit.
[206:28.01]We can't quit.
[206:29.52]Who made this game?
[206:31.36]It's so crazy.
[206:35.20]Nintendo and SEGA collaborated.
[206:37.78]You ever think this was going to happen in your life when you were like 15?
[206:39.87]Never.
[206:41.41]I didn't think we'd ever see Sonic and Mario in the same game.
[206:45.21]And now it happens all the time.
[206:46.85]Yeah.
[206:47.97]Let alone in the Olympics game.
[206:49.73]Yeah, they really kind of diluted it.
[206:51.11]It was cool, and now it's just, eh, whatever.
[206:53.75]Yeah, like, who cares?
[206:55.49]Like, even in Super Smash Brothers and everything, Mario Kart, it's insanity.
[207:00.32]Yeah.
[207:00.64]Like, Snake from Metal Gear is in Super Smash Brothers.
[207:05.27]I'm still not over that.
[207:07.01]I'm just crazy.
[207:07.87]I just can't believe Al Bundy was gotten, which is crazy.
[207:11.31]Al Bundy?
[207:11.85]Yeah, I know.
[207:12.23]What an insane time to be alive.
[207:18.34]Damn it.
[207:19.78]Wait, are we playing discus throw?
[207:21.83]We can quit.
[207:22.73]Oh, we can?
[207:23.89]Yeah, yeah.
[207:24.47]Hit start.
[207:24.93]Main menu.
[207:31.15]You see the Minecraft movie?
[207:34.83]Uh, no.
[207:36.86]Okay, loser has to see the Minecraft movie.
[207:39.84]I'd rather go to the dentist.
[207:41.40]How about loser has to go to the dentist?
[207:44.36]Oh, shit.
[207:45.31]But he should be going to the dentist.
[207:47.71]Loser has to go get his teeth cleaning.
[207:50.97]Oh, that's my worst nightmare.
[207:51.97]I don't want to do this.
[207:54.17]Well, I guess I can.
[207:55.01]Whatever.
[207:57.10]Alright.
[207:57.40]Do you want to move on from this one?
[207:58.90]Yeah, yeah.
[207:59.20]Let's move on.
[207:59.78]Alright.
[208:00.00]What do you want to do next?
[208:00.82]These games are slightly broken.
[208:03.64]Let's do... I don't want to spoil the list, so let me see.
[208:08.79]What have we got?
[208:09.32]Oh, okay.
[208:09.92]I'm actually, like, scrolling through the game.
[208:12.73]Oh, you're scrolling through it.
[208:14.81]Oh, let's do Nintendo Switch Sports.
[208:18.07]Can we do Super Dodgeball?
[208:21.04]Sure.
[208:21.80]I've never played it before.
[208:22.74]Oh, wait.
[208:22.98]Should we hold that one for next Switch Sunday in three months?
[208:26.80]Switch Sunday every Sunday, sometimes every three months?
[208:30.05]You want to do the Switch Sports?
[208:32.35]I feel like that's a good one.
[208:33.72]Okay, wait.
[208:34.24]I feel like Switch Sports is very similar to Clubhouse Games, so maybe that's a good one to wait for the next time.
[208:39.41]Do you know what I mean?
[208:40.15]Okay.
[208:40.27]Since it's a collection.
[208:41.75]Okay.
[208:42.09]Let's do Super Dodgeball.
[208:43.20]Super Dodgeball is absolutely lit.
[208:46.02]Let me just tell you.
[208:47.78]It's lit?
[208:48.50]No cap?
[208:50.11]I don't know.
[208:50.73]What?
[208:52.95]No cap.
[208:54.45]So, for those of you that don't know, this is the Dodgeball for NES.
[209:01.51]And this game is crazy.
[209:05.56]And I am going to beat Squeaks so badly that he might cry.
[209:11.89]I should wear a cap.
[209:13.35]Someone just said.
[209:15.21]Okay, I haven't cried in so long.
[209:17.03]I need a good cry.
[209:17.81]Online play.
[209:21.09]Connecting.
[209:22.72]Okay.
[209:24.06]I can create a room.
[209:26.68]The room is for only friends.
[209:30.17]Two players, and we'll do three matches versus play.
[209:35.25]Let me know when you see it.
[209:37.30]Um, do I... Okay, online play.
[209:40.74]Connecting to the internet.
[209:42.06]Find a room.
[209:44.81]Um... Do I do search by friend?
[209:48.29]You... I think that would work.
[209:50.61]Okay.
[209:51.63]So this is a game.
[209:52.23]It's dodgeball.
[209:53.70]All your characters have powers.
[209:56.38]I'll teach you.
[209:57.36]I'll teach you.
[209:58.90]Okay.
[210:01.56]Wait, my guy kinda looks like me.
[210:04.34]That's pretty sick.
[210:08.37]Okay.
[210:09.11]So.
[210:11.67]I think you can play this with one controller, but maybe not.
[210:14.86]So we wanna do a versus play.
[210:17.04]Skill level is fine, that's normal.
[210:19.80]This matters, by the way, because everybody has different moves.
[210:25.15]Oh, cool!

[211:08.22]Okay.
[211:08.57]You can pass it.
[211:10.59]It depends on what... There's only three buttons.
[211:12.29]There's pass.
[211:14.05]There's jump.
[211:15.70]Jump is... You can figure it out, right?
[211:18.64]Are you moving around right now?
[211:20.48]Uh, yeah.
[211:21.08]And then there is throw.
[211:22.37]If I throw, you would see, oh my god, there's a so much stronger than yours.
[211:27.66]What the hell?
[211:28.41]This game is fucked up.
[211:34.62]Okay, so let's teach we're gonna teach Okay If I throw the but if I throw it at you, okay, you can catch it with the throw button.
[211:56.71]So I'll get throw it Ow

[212:03.30]Different reasons.

[212:08.35]Okay, so here's the thing.
[212:09.99]You can run.
[212:10.87]If you go, if you double tap left or right, you'll go sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[212:15.30]You want to tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, and then throw, and you'll do a super powered move.
[212:19.20]Wait, like, wait, sorry, like, left, like with this analog stick?
[212:22.83]Yeah, yeah, see how you went da-da-da-da-da?
[212:25.19]If you do that and throw it, each character that you have here has a special move.
[212:29.80]my goodness okay and by the way these the people on the outside they can they can throw it back so let's do a test so throw you can throw it at me from outside I caught it oh gotcha I'm good okay no pass is a different button you can do some okay you can do some funky here where like watches I can kind of like go like this jump yeah pass it I could pass it across the and you could jump up and catch that if you wanted to I get that and go like this boom
[212:56.65]What happened?
[212:57.17]You alright?
[212:58.73]Wait, did I pause?
[213:01.74]I thought it just went slow-mo for a second.
[213:04.62]Ow.
[213:05.70]Alright, so you get it, you understand.
[213:07.27]Those guys aren't in the game.
[213:08.67]Those guys aren't in the game.
[213:11.03]You can kill people in this game.
[213:13.50]Okay.
[213:14.22]If your health goes to zero, the character's dead.
[213:18.08]I just want to make sure that's clear.
[213:19.85]Jesus.
[213:20.13]Oh, and the health bar is at top.
[213:21.76]And how do you jump?
[213:22.26]The health bar is the top.
[213:23.14]Jump is... I don't know what it's set for.
[213:25.78]It's set for, I think, A or B?
[213:30.09]Okay.
[213:33.31]Okay, that's... Sorry for pausing.
[213:36.08]Wait, I can't jump.
[213:37.00]But see, everybody has a superpower.
[213:39.24]My players don't jump.
[213:42.43]My players don't jump, Jeremiah.
[213:43.93]Wait, can you... Can you change your controls if you hit the menu button?
[213:49.94]Control manual.
[213:51.20]There you go.
[213:52.75]Button 1 and 2 is A. So if you press A... Wait, but my players don't jump.
[213:58.25]They should jump.
[213:59.76]They're not jumping.
[214:00.72]Can you set it to something else?
[214:05.46]Uh... No.
[214:06.84]You probably can hit the menu.
[214:10.47]Oh, maybe.
[214:16.30]Dude, that guy just went flying.
[214:18.28]Okay.
[214:18.82]Okay.
[214:19.63]But you want to go back to the menu?
[214:20.73]Oh, I can jump, I can jump.
[214:21.61]Oh, you got it?
[214:21.99]A plus B. I see.
[214:23.31]Oh, yeah, you can set it to be, okay.
[214:26.30]You ready to give it a try?
[214:27.08]Oh, you can set it to be one thing?
[214:28.16]Yeah, let's do it.
[214:28.81]I'm down.
[214:31.19]Wait, let me actually, let me read the controls, like, fully.
[214:35.16]Button two while jumping with the ball is a jump shot.
[214:41.29]Yeah, you can run and jump.
[214:43.89]You can pass it.
[214:44.78]You can pass it to different people on the team.
[214:48.40]This is a classic NES game.
[214:50.88]Okay, cool.
[214:51.76]Press button one to duck.
[214:53.98]Button two to catch.
[215:00.33]What does it say?
[215:01.53]Okay, yeah, I'm ready.
[215:05.83]I'm down to try it.
[215:09.76]There's two buttons.
[215:14.40]Oh my god.
[215:15.78]Yeah, this game goes pretty crazy, by the way.
[215:20.01]And does it auto-switch who you're controlling?
[215:22.73]Oh my god.
[215:23.42]It will, but if you will have ac- I think you can set who you want to have controlled.
[215:28.34]If I go over here, right?
[215:29.93]If I pass it, for instance, right here, right?
[215:32.67]Now I control this character now.
[215:34.67]I see.
[215:35.35]Good catch.
[215:38.94]You can do that too.
[215:42.92]Why would you do that?
[215:44.30]That's evil.
[215:45.30]He's not even in the game.
[215:46.34]He's not in the game.
[215:49.09]Okay.
[215:49.21]Alright.
[215:49.47]I'm good.
[215:51.19]Oh, went over the line.
[215:52.23]Went over the line.
[215:53.17]You went over the line.
[215:54.09]Oh, that's why.
[215:59.38]What is that?
[216:00.78]Everybody has a superpower.
[216:01.72]You're doing combos.
[216:04.32]You're doing combos.
[216:05.88]Bro, the ball's still in the air.
[216:07.14]He can't get it.
[216:09.36]Good luck.
[216:11.62]Wait, I... Like, in that case, do I'm supposed to try to catch it?
[216:14.83]Yep, you want to try to catch it if you can.
[216:16.43]We'll get out of the way.
[216:26.78]Oh, shit.
[216:27.62]That was a good... Alright, I'm sorry.
[216:30.62]Alright, hey, hey, hey.
[216:33.97]Oh, no.
[216:40.59]Oh, shit.
[216:45.36]Nope!
[216:46.94]Pause abuse!
[216:49.44]I'm griefing.
[216:52.87]It's hard to tell if you're passing it to your own guys or throwing it at me.
[216:56.10]That looks like... You gotta throw the jumps in, you gotta do the superpowers.
[217:06.23]What's happening?
[217:08.44]Why did I just hand it to you?
[217:09.96]What was happening?
[217:12.07]You sprinted over the line.
[217:13.43]I did not cross the line there.
[217:14.99]You sprinted over the line.
[217:15.97]You did.
[217:16.15]You sprinted.
[217:21.58]You, what the fuck?
[217:25.10]Oh, you think that's funny?
[217:27.74]Damn it.
[217:29.02]Damn it.
[217:32.25]And if you, by the way, if you tap, like if you run sprinting and you tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, then you throw, you'll do your super move.
[217:37.55]Oh, shit.
[217:39.16]Everybody's got a- and everybody's got a different move.
[217:41.88]Oh my god, sorry, I keep pausing.
[217:43.48]By the way, you just took a fucking- you almost killed me.
[217:47.27]I keep hitting the pause button on accident for some reason.
[217:49.87]I swear it's not on purpose.
[217:52.52]You believe me, right?
[217:53.50]I do, actually, because it's bound to, like, X. It's- yeah, it's, like, bound next to all the other buttons.
[217:58.89]What the f- I don't want to pass it to your guy.
[218:00.45]Here we go.
[218:09.87]Okay.
[218:18.32]Oh my god!
[218:18.74]Why is it doing one damage to you?
[218:21.46]I'm strong.
[218:22.74]Good job, Rajiv.
[218:26.04]That's my freaking guy.
[218:28.67]Fuck!
[218:29.31]Oh!
[218:34.95]Come on!
[218:35.49]I gotta get you with the fucking swirly.
[218:38.07]Is that because you double tapped right?
[218:39.97]So you have to go like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, you spam it, and then you do it.
[218:44.63]Okay, okay.
[218:47.09]Oh, he's dead.
[218:51.36]Pick it up.
[218:54.18]Oh.
[218:57.44]Wait, Baja is dead.
[218:58.74]You killed him.
[219:00.31]Don't you think this dodgeball stuff is going too far?
[219:02.39]You're killing my guys.
[219:04.47]Like, where's the humanity?
[219:06.31]Oh, nice, I blocked it.
[219:09.82]Why is it only doing one damage?
[219:13.17]Wait, that's... Shit.
[219:20.76]You gotta watch your back.
[219:22.93]I'll turn around.
[219:26.53]Oh.
[219:29.38]BM.
[219:30.82]What the fuck?
[219:36.07]Ooh, not...
[219:38.36]He didn't even try to take one.
[219:40.12]He tried.
[219:41.53]He just got hit.
[219:45.83]Get it!
[219:46.61]Pick it up!
[219:50.50]Oh my god, he's got... Good grab.
[220:00.09]Okay.
[220:01.05]Okay, hold on.
[220:01.62]I have an idea.
[220:05.98]I just gave it to you.
[220:07.97]I'm trying to, like, tap to the right.
[220:13.73]Uh-oh.
[220:13.87]Oh, my God.
[220:14.15]He's facing the wrong way.
[220:15.74]Classic Rajiv.
[220:19.60]This is my best bet.
[220:20.66]Oh, my God.
[220:20.98]You blocked it?
[220:24.07]Ah, he dodged.
[220:26.65]Come on.
[220:27.05]What?
[220:29.13]Oh.
[220:29.61]I caught that.
[220:31.26]Nah, facing the wrong way.
[220:33.83]What am I gonna do it?
[220:35.21]What am I gonna do it?
[220:35.93]I'm ready.
[220:36.51]I'm ready.
[220:37.39]I'm not scared.
[220:39.22]He's over the line, referee!
[220:41.80]You killed him!
[220:42.60]3v1.
[220:44.15]Alright.
[220:47.93]Swami's gotta go cr- No!
[220:52.32]Oh!
[220:54.12]Come on, get it!
[220:54.74]Get it!
[220:56.15]He's fucked up!
[221:00.49]Nope.
[221:04.02]This is bullying.
[221:08.62]I just keep fucking kidding you.
[221:11.51]Wait, come on.
[221:12.15]You can't go over the line to pick up the ball.
[221:13.93]If you run fast enough, you can.
[221:16.13]I can catch it in midair.
[221:21.60]Come on.
[221:27.31]Boom.
[221:29.11]I haven't even taken out one of your guys.
[221:32.07]We can pick characters next time.
[221:36.24]Yeah, I gotta pick a different place.
[221:40.86]Dude, I swear.
[221:42.09]Are you on Joy- I should get off Joy-Cons.
[221:44.79]Alright, so I'll give you a pro tip.
[221:47.07]Don't use the analog, use the other buttons down on the lower left.
[221:51.39]Oh!
[221:52.49]Wait, you should have told me that!
[221:55.59]It's just a warm-up.
[221:56.09]Tell me that after my friends Rajiv and Bata are dead... It's just a warm-up.
[222:00.56]...you let them die.
[222:01.80]You got blood on your hand, man.
[222:06.06]Shit.
[222:06.47]Oh!
[222:06.55]Okay, I'm ready.
[222:08.53]Ow!
[222:14.44]Oh, this could be the end.
[222:15.14]Oh, man.
[222:16.32]No, it's not over.
[222:20.78]Come on, get it!
[222:23.03]That shouldn't be allowed.
[222:24.43]I'm, wait, I'm spamming... B. Get it!
[222:27.75]Is that the wrong button?
[222:29.71]Uh, to get up?
[222:31.38]No, to like, grab and catch?
[222:34.16]I, my buttons are different, I think, than yours.
[222:35.50]My, Y for me is throw and catch.
[222:38.35]Oh, you rebound them.
[222:39.35]I rebound it.
[222:45.65]Okay.
[222:45.77]Okay.
[222:45.89]Oh!
[222:45.99]Oh, what?
[222:46.28]You still got it.
[222:46.84]That's not fair.
[222:48.78]Oh!
[222:49.60]Double kill.
[222:54.46]Oh, man.
[222:56.31]I got a rebind.
[222:59.79]I love how you played this.
[223:01.56]You're just clowning on me.
[223:03.30]Okay, good.
[223:04.58]No, hey, this is the warm-up.
[223:05.96]This is not even a real one.
[223:06.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
[223:10.73]Good catch.
[223:11.31]Oh, there we go.
[223:18.32]Surely when it's... Oops.
[223:20.38]Nope.
[223:23.81]Woah!
[223:25.83]Big damage!
[223:26.17]Henry is dead!
[223:27.13]You just did 23 damage!
[223:29.36]Henry is dead.
[223:31.64]What the hell was that?
[223:39.87]Alright, Scott, it's time to end it.
[223:42.45]Come back!
[223:43.35]No, no, you won't.
[223:48.34]Oh, Swami down!
[223:51.70]Alright.
[223:52.27]Wait a second.
[223:53.03]Wait a second.
[223:54.11]You figured it out.
[223:55.97]If I use my power, it does so much damage.
[223:59.40]It does a lot.
[224:00.08]Okay.
[224:01.34]Okay.
[224:01.64]Okay.
[224:01.82]I see.
[224:02.58]I didn't know there was, like, different damage levels.
[224:04.12]Okay.
[224:04.28]Wait.
[224:04.68]I get it now.
[224:05.87]Are you good?
[224:07.09]I'm good.
[224:07.73]I'm ready.
[224:09.73]Okay.
[224:09.85]I'm going to be America.
[224:12.80]USA.
[224:14.22]I'll be Japan.
[224:14.80]Okay.
[224:16.88]Alright.
[224:17.34]I'm going to change some positions here.
[224:22.15]I want... I believe people would do... I want John to be number one.
[224:30.30]I feel like some of the people that are usually on the back row have crazy moves.
[224:37.07]Alright, you ready?
[224:40.75]Yeah, I'm ready.
[224:41.43]Oh, you gotta set him.
[224:43.69]Oh, I have to change positions?
[224:45.32]Well, I think you said yes.
[224:47.93]Oh.
[224:49.15]Sam is pretty great.
[224:50.16]I'm gonna say no.
[224:50.86]Oh, okay, yeah.
[224:51.18]There you go.
[224:51.50]Alright, you ready?
[224:52.20]There we go.
[224:52.80]Yeah.
[224:53.50]Ooh, big luck.
[224:55.02]Good luck.
[224:55.32]Alright, good luck.
[224:55.74]This is a real one.
[224:56.91]This is real.
[225:04.22]It's supposed to be a real one.
[225:07.72]Yeah, it's real.
[225:08.24]It's real.
[225:10.57]Ooh.
[225:10.67]Ooh.
[225:11.07]Oh my god.
[225:11.83]Big moves on the back line here.
[225:13.15]Huge moves on the back line.
[225:17.13]This is monstrous what's going on right now.
[225:20.73]Wait, you can't cross the line, right?
[225:23.32]Oh my god, this is just a complete decimation of Team USA.
[225:28.05]We should play Counter-Strike after this.
[225:29.31]I think that'd be really good.
[225:31.34]Super Mario speedrunning?
[225:34.38]Alright, I can't get it from here.
[225:35.53]Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[225:42.07]Oh!
[225:43.33]You jumped into it!
[225:45.91]I thought that was a lob.
[225:47.79]There we go.
[225:48.65]Mistake.
[225:50.36]Shit.
[225:53.82]I still come back, I believe.
[225:57.34]Okay, here we go.
[226:00.79]Okay.
[226:01.19]Boom!
[226:01.99]That's a hit.
[226:02.45]I'm gonna do it.
[226:05.43]I'm not scared.
[226:07.45]I'm so ready to react.
[226:15.75]Remember, make sure you give yourself enough space to run.
[226:18.79]Right, right.
[226:19.53]I just start from way back.
[226:24.36]There we go!
[226:25.42]That one hurt a lot, actually.
[226:27.63]No shit.
[226:32.19]Damn.
[226:35.68]That guy's diving.
[226:36.86]Okay.
[226:40.18]Oop!
[226:45.01]Ooh, looks like John's gonna be the last one left.
[226:49.60]How did you kill my guys so quick?
[226:52.92]Oh my god.
[226:53.42]I did a lot.
[226:54.60]Pick it up, pick it up!
[226:59.07]Alright, there could be some backline bullshit here.
[227:00.83]Don't let it happen.
[227:03.57]Good.
[227:04.19]Good.
[227:05.07]BM.
[227:06.12]Good.
[227:07.98]That's just rude, poor backline.
[227:10.44]Yep, fuck him up.
[227:12.46]Be careful, you never know.
[227:17.61]You can't, that's like so hard to catch.
[227:21.36]It is actually hard.
[227:24.80]Damn it.
[227:33.23]No, it turned around.
[227:35.31]I'm not, I'm fine.
[227:38.78]How?
[227:39.24]Oh, is there like a cooldown when you try to catch?
[227:41.52]I think you can only go like one, it's a good one or two second cooldown, I think, yep.
[227:45.62]Oh, okay, okay.
[227:47.58]Okay.
[227:48.06]Boom.
[227:50.33]Oh, you're next?
[227:51.45]Boom.
[227:51.95]Okay.
[227:54.67]Oh.
[227:55.67]Oh.
[227:56.58]What the fuck?
[227:57.34]How did you catch it?
[228:04.02]Oh, mean.
[228:04.87]Oh, mean.
[228:07.29]So evil.
[228:11.96]Oh, I tried to block.
[228:15.14]Oh.
[228:15.84]Please.
[228:16.02]Come on, keep rolling over here.
[228:16.84]Please.
[228:17.04]Come on.
[228:18.14]Nope.
[228:20.67]Yoink.
[228:26.43]Good catch.
[228:31.14]How?
[228:31.74]What a quick turnaround.
[228:34.16]You're just juggling my poor guy, John.
[228:36.48]Come on, I can get it.
[228:37.80]It's so evil.
[228:39.34]Let me just practice jumping.
[228:41.24]Nope.
[228:43.73]Jumping is this.
[228:44.79]Okay, cool.
[228:46.14]Yeah, you could, if you want to just run, yeah, you, ooh, seven.
[228:49.20]There we go.
[228:50.19]He wouldn't.
[229:02.27]Oh, I spiked it right into your head.
[229:04.13]Okay, okay, we got to play this again.
[229:05.59]I'm done.
[229:06.37]We got to.
[229:07.13]It's fun.
[229:08.52]It's so fun.
[229:09.44]How did I get it?
[229:12.02]That was illegal.
[229:14.83]How'd you catch that?
[229:15.97]That might be seasoned.
[229:18.71]Rematch, rematch, rematch.
[229:20.19]Alright, yeah, rematch.
[229:21.34]I'm checking your hours to see how many hours you put into this.
[229:24.22]You rebound the controls?
[229:26.04]You know who to play as?
[229:27.34]Like, I'm getting swindled.
[229:30.27]We'll pick different countries.
[229:32.77]Okay.
[229:34.63]You're like, yeah, I totally changed everything.
[229:36.83]You gotta be comfortable.
[229:39.74]Alright, how about Iceland?
[229:40.56]I'll be Iceland.
[229:42.42]Okay.
[229:43.84]I'll be... I'll be, uh... You can be the all-stars if you want.
[229:51.23]That's fine.
[229:52.49]Oh no, because then if I lose, it's embarrassing.
[229:54.78]But I've played.
[229:55.54]I've played a lot.
[229:56.02]This is like me playing against you in Counter-Strike.
[229:58.72]Okay, I'll be all-stars.
[230:01.07]Okay.
[230:01.81]Let's go.
[230:03.05]We got Jack, Tom, Fred.
[230:05.37]Why is Iceland so crazy?
[230:07.98]Maybe you should play as Iceland.
[230:09.74]Hold on.
[230:10.63]Wait, why are my stats so low?
[230:13.27]They're supposed to be the all-stars.
[230:15.66]Yeah, wait, what?
[230:19.34]Good start.
[230:20.20]That was very good, actually.
[230:26.09]They might have low defense.
[230:32.37]Oh, good luck catching that wacky one.
[230:34.51]Okay, they got low defense.
[230:35.92]They got low defense, I think.
[230:37.50]Oh, I see, I see.
[230:42.19]Oh my God.
[230:43.63]Oh my God.
[230:44.73]That one actually is hard to catch.
[230:46.25]You guys are so strong.
[230:47.17]Dude, let's go.
[230:52.18]Don't.
[230:58.91]That would have been bad.
[231:00.43]That would have been real bad.
[231:07.07]Shit.
[231:07.33]Okay.
[231:07.57]Well, it worked.
[231:10.26]I didn't catch it.
[231:12.38]Alright, good, good.
[231:15.80]That's mean!
[231:17.69]That's a freaking legend you're hurting back there.
[231:19.73]Oh fuck, I didn't want to do that.
[231:24.65]Okay, please?
[231:29.26]My guy just goes flying.
[231:31.60]Oh my god!
[231:34.01]You're sick, you're sick.
[231:35.63]Okay.
[231:37.74]Okay, by the way, that can go through people.
[231:41.35]Holy.
[231:46.79]Get it?
[231:52.50]Pick it up!
[231:53.12]Oh my god, what is my guy doing?
[231:54.91]Oh, good luck catching this one.
[232:00.90]Be careful, careful, careful, careful!
[232:03.24]Actually...
[232:08.77]It's a lot.
[232:10.30]It's a lot.
[232:12.96]I got nervous.
[232:14.08]It was going too slow.
[232:15.10]Oh, no.
[232:18.56]Oh, no.
[232:20.75]I have to say it to you again.
[232:21.51]I'm going to do it to you again.
[232:22.57]I got nervous.
[232:23.23]I got so nervous.
[232:27.57]Oh, no.
[232:27.75]Oh, God.
[232:28.33]Alright.
[232:31.90]Nice.
[232:32.02]You got it.
[232:32.28]You got it.
[232:32.64]You got it.
[232:32.90]You got it.
[232:33.18]There we go.
[232:33.64]Let's freaking go.
[232:36.52]What the hell?
[232:44.27]Fred's already dead.
[232:45.57]Fred's dead.
[232:47.65]Wait, why is my guy not charging?
[232:50.38]Like, aren't these guys supposed to be all-stars?
[232:53.00]They're not that good.
[232:54.02]I think you should play Iceland.
[232:56.33]Honestly, I think I've been accidentally playing all the top tier countries.
[233:00.61]Accidentally?
[233:02.16]Yeah, right.
[233:02.66]Your heart's racing.
[233:03.54]You want to win so bad.
[233:09.22]Let's go.
[233:09.84]Oh, shit.
[233:14.37]Oh, no, please.
[233:15.37]Good luck with this one.
[233:17.03]Okay, I'm ready.
[233:18.12]Yeah, I'm ready.
[233:18.86]I promise I catch this.
[233:29.32]He's dead.
[233:31.77]Oh, that was crazy.
[233:33.51]I can't see it.
[233:35.09]How am I supposed to catch it?
[233:37.89]I don't know how you're supposed to catch it.
[233:40.60]That's so BM.
[233:41.24]Do you want to play Iceland?
[233:43.06]Yes, yes, I want to play Iceland.
[233:44.62]Alright, remember, if you jump and you do the super move, it's a different move.
[233:49.03]Probably should have told you that.
[233:51.15]Wait, wait.
[233:51.89]If I jump and do the super, it's a different move versus just on the floor.
[233:55.24]Yep, if you do run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, jump and then throw it, you'll do a different move.
[234:01.38]Oh, versus just run, run, run, throw.
[234:03.74]Okay.
[234:04.09]Who do you want me to play as?
[234:05.35]I'll do Iceland.
[234:05.91]I'll do Iceland.
[234:06.39]You be Iceland.
[234:07.33]They're good.
[234:08.25]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[234:08.95]Who should I be?
[234:09.81]You pick the team.
[234:11.25]You be India.
[234:12.44]Okay.
[234:14.48]Okay, good luck.
[234:25.41]Okay.
[234:25.53]Oh, no.
[234:26.96]Alright, here we go.
[234:33.02]Uh, okay.
[234:33.88]I feel it.
[234:34.44]I get it.
[234:35.81]Just passing around.
[234:36.67]Just passing around.
[234:38.07]Okay.
[234:39.53]Boom!
[234:42.32]That thing split into three.
[234:43.46]That was a triple shot.
[234:45.14]Oh, my God.
[234:45.38]Wait.
[234:46.11]India rules.
[234:48.63]Oh, good luck catching that.
[234:49.91]Good luck catching it.
[234:52.54]Wow.
[234:53.28]Wait.
[234:58.72]I was just joshing around.
[235:01.55]I got nervous.
[235:07.39]I think I got too nervous.
[235:10.46]Okay.
[235:11.08]I only did two.
[235:12.78]I think India has high defense.
[235:14.26]I think I have really high defense.
[235:16.13]Oh, okay.
[235:16.57]That's why your health is so low.
[235:19.71]Oh, and high offense.
[235:21.55]I think so.
[235:26.44]Oh, yeah.
[235:26.68]Like, that does... Well, it wasn't...
[235:29.57]Okay, I'm ready.
[235:30.53]Alright, hold on, I wanna... Make it happen.
[235:34.40]Bring it on.
[235:35.50]Make it happen.
[235:37.50]Oh shit.
[235:40.35]Okay.
[235:41.59]Grew it up, it's fine.
[235:43.25]Oh.
[235:44.43]I didn't have enough runway.
[235:47.76]No!
[235:50.18]Get the ball!
[235:50.88]Oh shit, get away.
[235:55.27]What?!
[235:55.61]I did not wanna throw it that way.
[235:56.83]Oh!
[235:58.54]Why don't my linesmen, like, catch it?
[236:03.95]I don't know.
[236:04.23]I think you can control them if it's coming near them.
[236:07.16]Oh, okay.
[236:13.24]There we go.
[236:14.17]That's not good.
[236:14.61]I'm gonna lose somebody.
[236:16.51]Good.
[236:18.59]I'm gunning for Bata or Swami.
[236:22.14]Oh!
[236:23.04]Fuck.
[236:24.68]Get it.
[236:26.76]Yes!
[236:28.27]Okay.
[236:30.79]Alright.
[236:31.95]Now the gloves come off.
[236:32.58]Now we got a little game.
[236:33.94]He jumped in!
[236:37.90]You were trying to have that hit to him.
[236:39.27]I spit everywhere, by the way.
[236:42.67]Oh!
[236:43.23]Seven!
[236:43.59]Wait, let's go!
[236:44.33]You just jumped and hit your head on a ceiling.
[236:51.61]I was going for a header.
[236:57.61]Oh, nice catch.
[236:58.75]Oh my god, seven for that?
[237:00.87]It's not even a special.
[237:01.95]Ah, it's another slow one.
[237:04.30]I got it.
[237:05.22]Come on.
[237:11.42]You don't think I can catch this?
[237:12.91]I'm a, I'm a Hans.
[237:14.93]Come on.
[237:16.39]There we go.
[237:17.59]Let's just keep doing that to you.
[237:19.79]There we go.
[237:20.47]Alright.
[237:22.08]I actually have to, I'm going to start trying as hard as I can now.
[237:25.86]Oh yeah?
[237:34.29]Oh shit!
[237:37.46]Why was I standing so close?
[237:40.14]Oh shit.
[237:41.92]No!
[237:42.46]2v2.
[237:49.13]Oh, that's a bad, that's huge, that's a big deal for you.
[237:51.60]That's insane!
[237:58.89]Shit.
[238:01.51]That does one damage.
[238:03.72]That's insane.
[238:08.21]Dude, the jump!
[238:09.27]The jump timing!
[238:10.75]You just gotta jump over the edge.
[238:13.32]Alright, there you go!
[238:20.38]Like, what the fuck is that?!
[238:23.57]Oh shit!
[238:23.75]What is that?!
[238:25.53]What is that?!
[238:26.61]It's like an ultimate!
[238:30.80]Like, oh man.
[238:31.76]Hans is gonna 1v2.
[238:34.62]You ready?
[238:35.08]This is going to be a montage.
[238:35.94]Yeah, I'm ready.
[238:36.38]You ready?
[238:36.80]Bring it on.
[238:37.40]Yeah, bring it on.
[238:40.75]I got it.
[238:41.19]I got it.
[238:41.63]I got it.
[238:42.07]I got it.
[238:42.47]I got it.
[238:43.53]Look out.
[238:48.52]Uh-oh.
[238:50.48]Oh, here we go.
[238:56.54]That's nine damage.
[238:59.82]Yeah, but I got it.
[239:01.36]You can't dodge Hans.
[239:02.98]I've been training for this.
[239:04.44]Why are you so close?
[239:07.63]That's a big mistake.
[239:10.25]That's a big mistake.
[239:11.97]No, no, no, no, no.
[239:13.67]I stop this no matter what.
[239:20.38]Like, all my health had four bars, man.
[239:23.35]That was devastating.
[239:25.13]That was horrifying.
[239:27.31]Damn.
[239:27.85]Yeah, this game is awesome.
[239:29.57]This game is really fun.
[239:31.01]We gotta play Beanball, because I think it's free-for-all.
[239:34.81]Beanball?
[239:35.55]It's called Beanball.
[239:38.62]Oh, let's do it.
[239:39.52]Are you ready?
[239:40.68]Yeah.
[239:41.92]Wait, free-for-all for everybody?
[239:43.44]It's free-for-all.
[239:45.82]Let's do Iceland.
[239:47.44]Okay.
[239:47.58]Four players.
[239:49.87]Oh, no, no, no.
[239:50.31]We want two players.
[239:51.59]Oh, shit.
[239:52.23]Wait, so for every character?
[239:54.11]Yeah.
[239:54.39]Oh, shit.
[239:54.71]We gotta go back.
[239:57.92]Can we go back?
[239:59.54]No.
[239:59.74]We can't.
[240:01.08]Oh, no, you can leave game.
[240:03.78]If you hit start.
[240:05.97]Oh, okay, yep.
[240:08.23]Wait, but I think that might... Oh, the host... Oh, it's alright.
[240:12.11]I can just make another one.
[240:13.82]Okay, okay.
[240:14.06]Alright, friends only, two players.
[240:18.78]Alright, we're good to go.
[240:21.45]Searching for room.
[240:27.46]Isn't this game fun, though?
[240:29.09]It's so good.
[240:29.75]It was on the NES?
[240:31.03]Yep.
[240:31.71]I can't believe I've never played it.
[240:33.13]It's really good.
[240:35.28]I just need to get the timing of catching it, but... Especially with how fast some of them move.
[240:42.65]It is a timing thing, yeah.
[240:44.03]Yeah, yeah.
[240:45.01]Alright, so this is... We're doing two players.
[240:47.56]Okay.
[240:49.16]Right?
[240:49.52]Technically?
[240:50.22]Is that how this is going to work, maybe?
[240:52.54]Oh, it says... Okay, perfect.
[240:55.22]Two players.
[240:56.57]So can you, are you picking?
[240:58.15]There we go.
[240:58.65]I'll be Bjorn.
[241:00.17]Alright.
[241:00.41]I'm going to be, I'm going to be Nils.
[241:03.11]Alright.
[241:03.35]Free-for-all.
[241:04.36]Good luck.
[241:11.28]Wait, so we're just attacking each other.
[241:12.79]It's just, it's just free-for-all.
[241:14.75]I see.
[241:17.17]Shit.
[241:20.14]Oh, I just destroyed that guy.
[241:20.88]Oh my God, what damage.
[241:24.99]I'm running.
[241:28.56]Good, good.
[241:29.20]They're bullying me.
[241:30.16]This is such a disaster.
[241:35.46]I feel like it's smart to just run away.
[241:36.90]Yeah, you just don't want to be in the line of fire of any of this.
[241:45.13]Shit, I'm going to go the other way.
[241:46.56]Oh, God.
[241:49.40]Oh, the CPU got you.
[241:52.65]Why is he gunning you?
[241:53.69]They hate you.
[241:54.97]This guy hates you.
[241:56.67]Who is that guy?
[241:59.14]I don't know.
[242:00.08]Is it- no.
[242:01.36]Elgy?
[242:04.74]That guy hit himself.
[242:05.99]The ball bounced back and hit him in the face.
[242:09.13]Oh man, that's a lot.
[242:12.81]I've never even got the ball yet.
[242:15.04]I'm just staying alive.
[242:16.04]I'm just- I'm playing in a corner.
[242:21.08]I'll win via 1v1.
[242:24.99]But what if it's a 1v1 versus me?
[242:28.56]I'll win.
[242:29.52]100%.
[242:29.80]Because you're going to be weak.
[242:32.78]I could be.
[242:41.82]Ooh, 7 damage.
[242:44.74]Oh, but Hans is going down.
[242:46.43]Look at that.
[242:51.07]Why did some of them throw it against the wall?
[242:55.38]I don't know.
[242:55.66]I have to imagine the AI that's programmed into these is like a stick figure.
[243:02.73]It's just, if you have balls, throw.
[243:06.72]It doesn't matter what direction you're facing.
[243:08.41]Oh, 10.
[243:09.13]Oh my god.
[243:10.39]Brutal.
[243:15.13]Are you targeting me?
[243:16.04]I saw that.
[243:17.88]You turned around.
[243:18.86]No, wait a second.
[243:19.68]I'm trying to.
[243:20.30]Hey, you're the only competition here.
[243:22.09]The rest of these guys pick up all in front of the fence.
[243:24.43]Actually, that guy didn't.
[243:27.67]Oh.
[243:35.03]Oh, I just killed that guy.
[243:36.53]21 damage.
[243:38.49]Brutal.
[243:38.93]Oh, my God.
[243:39.51]I am just laying out people left and right.
[243:42.00]Oh.
[243:50.57]I love doing the big jump and turn one.
[243:52.78]Me too.
[243:52.98]It's like my favorite one.
[243:53.80]It feels so good, especially if it's like a special move.
[243:56.98]This guy's... It feels so satisfying.
[244:00.29]Oh.
[244:02.21]Oh.
[244:02.97]I'm being way too aggressive.
[244:05.92]He's just pulling you.
[244:11.76]Big hit.
[244:12.06]Oh my god.
[244:12.42]21 damage.
[244:16.05]You're just bouncing it off my head.
[244:18.81]No.
[244:20.14]Oh, how are people sprinting?
[244:22.10]I love the music.
[244:24.00]That guy's gone.
[244:26.38]I'm telling you, it's going to be a 1v1.
[244:36.76]Hey!
[244:39.26]This guy's hit me so many times.
[244:40.72]Wait, you think there's like a host advantage?
[244:46.65]Uh, yeah.
[244:47.55]I think there is.
[244:48.27]Oh, that's why.
[244:49.53]On LAN, I catch all of these.
[244:53.57]Oh, shit.
[245:04.45]Oh.
[245:06.15]How does that hit me?
[245:07.01]I thought it was past me.
[245:08.25]Oh, man.
[245:08.73]I'm going to let him just do his thing here.
[245:12.28]No, no, no.
[245:12.52]Alright.
[245:12.74]That guy's gone.
[245:13.96]Hey, good luck.
[245:14.36]It's me.
[245:14.80]Let me get the ball.
[245:17.07]I just passed it to you.
[245:19.64]In dodgeball fashion, it's only fair... Okay.
[245:27.29]Alright, what's your proposition?
[245:29.75]Uh, good luck.
[245:43.65]Okay.
[245:43.77]Come on, come on!
[245:44.43]Bring it on!
[245:44.83]Do it!
[245:45.47]Do it!
[245:47.43]You don't have it in you.
[245:59.16]No, Bjorn.
[246:01.73]I'm gonna get you.
[246:02.21]I'm gonna do it.
[246:02.73]I'm gonna do it right now.
[246:03.29]No, you're not.
[246:03.61]I'm gonna do it right now.
[246:04.29]You can't do it.
[246:07.27]Damn it.
[246:08.80]No.
[246:09.24]Good catch.
[246:09.64]That was an ender.
[246:12.26]Damn it.
[246:17.54]Here we go.
[246:18.44]Big comeback.
[246:20.14]Oh.
[246:24.41]Don't.
[246:26.19]Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it.
[246:27.23]I catch it.
[246:29.59]I was turning around.
[246:31.06]Like a fool.
[246:32.88]Like a total fool.
[246:37.06]Oh, no.
[246:37.82]I'm so embarrassed.
[246:39.11]Someone said I've been wearing the same shirt since last stream.
[246:41.07]No, I haven't.
[246:43.10]How many shirts do you wear in a week?
[246:44.95]Probably four.
[246:45.25]Be honest.
[246:46.29]Yeah, okay, same!
[246:47.97]Like, sometimes I'll wear the same shirt, like, two times or three times in the week.
[246:53.16]What's the big deal?
[246:53.88]I don't see the big deal.
[246:55.77]That's not so gross.
[246:56.37]As long as they're clean?
[246:57.59]Yeah.
[246:57.81]As long as they're clean, it doesn't matter.
[246:59.71]Yeah, like, if you're wearing them in the house, what's the big deal?
[247:05.09]Hey, sometimes you have a circulation of two or three shirts, and that's it.
[247:09.22]Yes.
[247:09.70]Then you just clean them.
[247:10.28]Yeah.
[247:11.14]Yeah, and they're clean, and they're, like, my favorite shirts.
[247:14.14]Yeah, sorry.
[247:14.78]Why even buy more?
[247:15.58]How many times have you gotten in a position where you have, like, one-y different shirts, and you only wear three of them?
[247:21.43]Yeah, that's everybody.
[247:22.51]Everybody.
[247:23.31]All the time.
[247:23.89]That's every single person.
[247:25.95]Yep.
[247:28.24]Do you want to keep going with this, or do you want to do another one?
[247:29.94]I use Old Spice Swagger.
[247:31.66]You owe Old Spice?
[247:32.58]Do you do...
[247:34.60]No, no, no, I use the deodorant.
[247:36.19]I don't like the spray.
[247:37.79]Oh, yeah.
[247:38.47]Me either.
[247:41.16]It's okay if you use the spray.
[247:42.36]I don't.
[247:42.92]Yeah, you do.
[247:44.73]And you have blushies, like, once again.
[247:46.41]No, like, you clearly change your voice when you're... I'll be right back.
[247:51.59]One second.
[247:52.25]I'll be right back.
[248:32.38]Change my shirt real quick.
[248:43.88]Right.
[248:46.08]Much better.
[248:46.56]Nobody tell him.
[248:47.38]Nobody tell him.
[248:48.00]Nobody tell him.
[248:49.16]Nobody tell him.
[248:51.68]Nobody tell him.
[248:55.01]Tell me what?
[249:00.53]Tell me what.
[249:01.09]Why do I have that?
[249:03.91]Tell me what.
[249:06.69]You have a plushie, don't you?
[249:10.46]I knew it!
[249:11.20]I knew it!
[249:11.72]I got a fucking full-size Luigi.
[249:13.92]I got a full-size Luigi stuffed animal.
[249:16.71]I'm not gonna call it that.
[249:19.51]What's wrong with a plushie?
[249:20.92]It's okay for it to be a plushie.
[249:22.82]It's a stuffed animal.
[249:24.85]It's a plushie.
[249:26.21]You got a plushie.
[249:27.11]You got a plushie collection.
[249:29.48]I've had that thing for a decade, okay?
[249:31.12]I've had it for 15 years.
[249:32.14]It's the only one I have.
[249:33.36]I'm not coming at you.
[249:34.34]I think it's cool that you have a plushie.
[249:36.11]Like, that's fine.
[249:36.73]I'm just wondering if you have a plushie collection.
[249:39.85]You got a Luigi full... That's a collection of one.
[249:42.39]That's one of one.
[249:43.02]Yeah, but it's a full-size plushie.
[249:47.34]That's cool.
[249:48.34]Good for you.
[249:49.36]Like, I have a plushie, too.
[249:51.05]Dude, what do you got?
[249:51.65]Show it.
[249:52.79]I have, like, a full-size Yoshi plushie in the other room.
[249:56.04]Do you want me to go get it?
[249:57.10]No.
[249:57.56]Should I go get it?
[249:58.30]No?
[249:58.86]Okay.
[249:58.98]Oh, not really.
[249:59.46]I love the good for you.
[250:06.68]Good for you.
[250:09.46]That's sweet.
[250:10.22]There's another one.
[250:11.02]Wait, full-size?
[250:12.38]That's implying that Luigi is, like, a foot tall.
[250:16.09]I mean... I actually don't know how tall Luigi is.
[250:22.00]I think that's a good time for a break.
[250:25.57]Yeah.
[250:26.71]It's been an hour already?
[250:27.85]It's been an hour, dude.
[250:28.83]We have blown through this.
[250:29.86]You're kidding!
[250:30.18]Yeah.
[250:30.50]Dude, this is crazy!
[250:32.44]Uh, we're back in- That one was so fun!
[250:36.63]That was a good one!
[250:37.21]Wasn't that really fun?
[250:38.07]Yeah, it's a good one!
[250:39.17]I am an expert, though.
[250:40.55]I do apologize.
[250:41.51]I do know how to play it.
[250:42.97]That's my fault.
[250:43.58]Uh, practice.
[250:44.26]I'll have to practice that one.
[250:47.38]Alright, we're back in, like, three or four minutes?
[250:49.50]Okay.
[250:49.78]What is wrong with the game?
[250:54.20]That was fucked up.
[250:54.98]I made a loud sound.
[250:59.95]Oh, yeah, because you left the game.
[251:00.94]Okay.
[251:01.86]Alright.
[251:02.18]I'll be right back.
[251:03.12]See you in three or four minutes.
[251:05.87]Alright.
[251:06.09]Yeah.
[251:06.23]Be right back.
[251:07.23]Ads are going to start in about a minute.
[251:08.65]I want to get water that's not brown.
[251:12.18]Be right back.
[256:16.84]I literally just sat down too.
[256:19.02]Not even kidding.
[256:20.16]Whoa.
[256:22.22]That's crazy.
[256:24.47]And I got a little Coke.
[256:27.73]I got a banana.
[256:31.90]I love bananas.
[256:34.78]Alright.
[256:35.00]So what's up next?
[256:35.54]Bananas and strawberries.
[256:37.29]Those are my faves.
[256:38.37]What do we do?
[256:39.23]I imagine we're going to only be able to do one or two more of these.
[256:42.91]Yeah.
[256:43.46]What's one you want to do?
[256:45.69]Let's see.
[256:46.41]There's so many.
[256:48.80]I'm down to do Nintendo Switch Sports.
[256:53.64]Okay, yeah.
[256:55.40]Wait, do you eat a bruised banana?
[256:57.37]Like, if it's bruised, you just throw it away?
[256:58.75]Throw it in a smoothie.
[257:02.33]Oh.
[257:02.84]But would you ever eat, like, a banana on its own bruised?
[257:06.20]Or is it too scary?
[257:10.35]It depends.
[257:12.35]On what?
[257:13.31]I don't know.
[257:14.05]How bad do I want a banana?
[257:16.78]You're like middling.
[257:18.60]You're like, oh, I'm not that hungry, but it's like a little snack.
[257:21.68]I could do something else.
[257:22.88]No, that's getting frozen and it's going in the smoothie.
[257:25.67]Oh.
[257:26.93]If I'm like a 7 or 8 out of 10 wanting a banana, then yeah.
[257:32.39]Depends.
[257:33.96]Okay.
[257:34.24]That's actually a fair answer.
[257:36.54]For some reason, I love when it's bruised.
[257:40.46]You like a bruised banana.
[257:42.24]It tastes more flavorful.
[257:45.23]Well, is it ripe or is it bruised?
[257:47.47]Because flavorful is ripe.
[257:50.35]It's like slightly brown.
[257:53.39]Okay, but that... Like certain points of it.
[257:56.26]You know what I mean?
[257:56.74]Like it's like a fun little texture.
[257:57.96]Like a fun little surprise.
[257:59.64]It kind of tastes like somebody spit the banana into your mouth, though.
[258:04.01]Yeah.
[258:08.81]I tried to mitigate that.
[258:10.84]I love how you're judging me when you have been putting this entire stream, water, mixing it into your coffee.
[258:19.01]Like, and now you're having it like ice.
[258:21.34]And what is water?
[258:22.50]Coffee and water makes coffee.
[258:25.30]Coffee, beans, and water is coffee.
[258:27.97]The concoction.
[258:29.21]I understand.
[258:30.39]But it's twisted.
[258:32.17]You can say that all you want.
[258:34.74]It's still coffee.
[258:35.96]Water over beans is coffee.
[258:39.09]Alright, so play with friends single player?
[258:42.12]Yeah.
[258:42.90]Alright, alright.
[258:45.00]Play with friends.
[258:48.30]I'm all banana-ed out.
[258:49.91]Alright, do we single player play with friends or two player play with friends?
[258:52.31]I don't get it.
[258:54.19]I feel like it has to be single player play with friends.
[258:57.44]Single player play with friends.
[259:00.88]Make sure you have enough space around you.
[259:02.70]Uh-oh.
[259:02.84]I thought you were going to say space on my hard drive.
[259:06.31]No, no, no.
[259:07.63]This is all downloaded.
[259:08.73]I had to uninstall so many great games.
[259:12.18]Oh, yeah, the Switch has a terrible... Okay, I think we have a password.
[259:17.56]Oh, okay.
[259:19.55]Okay, room ID.
[259:20.75]Anyone invite via ID.
[259:22.41]Friends, will you just search?
[259:23.59]No, we don't want that.
[259:25.77]So, room maximum two.
[259:27.15]Okay, I think only you can join.
[259:30.68]Only I can join?
[259:31.56]I think so.
[259:33.53]So you can join it.
[259:34.57]Can you join it here?
[259:35.21]Play with friends.
[259:36.01]Single, single player.
[259:37.49]Yep.
[259:38.01]And then I think it should pop up.
[259:39.90]Oh, I guess I've played this before.
[259:48.39]Join room.
[259:50.09]Was it drinking watered down coffee, playing single player with friends.
[259:55.73]There you are.
[259:56.97]Your name is cat dad.

[260:34.53]What is this bullshit?
[260:36.18]I'm serious.
[260:37.52]Wii Sports.
[260:40.38]Okay, think about what Wii Sports had.
[260:42.77]Wii Sports had a bunch of awesome shit in it.
[260:46.25]I feel like they added, like, I don't want to do badminton, volleyball.
[260:49.77]Volleyball in any game is 0.0.
[260:51.56]Do you agree?
[260:53.56]No, not Mario Party.
[260:55.02]I don't know.
[260:55.50]I think it's a 0.0 in every video game it's ever been in.
[260:58.11]I love how you had a point zero.
[260:59.43]Like, what game do you rank on a tenth decimal?
[261:03.05]I don't know.
[261:03.49]Like, you play tennis and you're like, point one, seven, point eight.
[261:07.22]There's no baseball.
[261:08.62]What were they doing?
[261:10.88]Baseball was the most fun thing in Wii Sports, and they just didn't even put it in the game.
[261:15.15]Why?
[261:16.45]Why?
[261:16.89]I don't know.
[261:17.91]That's insane.
[261:19.27]It's insanity.
[261:21.07]You want badminton or do you want baseball?
[261:25.10]I mean, yeah, you're right.
[261:27.27]I don't understand what was going on at the board meeting there.
[261:29.41]I don't get it.
[261:29.93]And you know what the worst part is, actually?
[261:31.43]They didn't add basketball until later.
[261:33.65]Yeah, this is new.
[261:34.48]This was not here the last time I played it.
[261:36.84]I don't understand what's going on here.
[261:38.48]I know.
[261:38.74]They messed up big time.
[261:40.72]Yeah, it was tennis, golf.
[261:42.18]And they're not adding it to the Switch 2.
[261:45.75]Huh?
[261:46.97]There's no Wii Sports for the Switch 2.
[261:49.47]There's a tech demo that's going to cost money.
[261:52.96]What?
[261:54.18]I know.
[261:55.32]It's crazy.
[261:57.24]Alright, what are we doing?
[261:57.96]What are we starting with?
[262:00.66]Let's play bowling.
[262:03.89]Sounds good.
[262:04.35]Is there bowling?
[262:05.47]By the way, I love Nintendo.
[262:07.67]I've got a big Luigi stuffed animal.
[262:09.98]I'm a big fan of Nintendo.
[262:11.50]It's a plushie.
[262:12.30]It's a plushie.
[262:13.08]I don't want to prove it.
[262:14.77]It's a stuffed character.
[262:16.73]I don't know what's wrong with plushie.
[262:18.61]Do you have action figures as well?
[262:21.22]We're not playing with 10 people.

[263:01.93]They don't have the strap.
[263:03.45]Don't tell me what to do.
[263:05.71]Did we get annoyed by those?
[263:07.94]What?
[263:08.54]Those like, hey, be careful.
[263:10.10]We mean be careful.
[263:11.06]Don't tell me how to live my life.
[263:13.74]Yeah, it just reminds me like maybe I'm too old to be doing this.
[263:17.26]That's true.
[263:18.08]I'm like, ugh.
[263:20.07]It's like watching the Nintendo Treehouse and it's like...
[263:23.06]Set sail for adventure in the new Legend of Zelda.
[263:26.39]I'm like sitting there in my underwear.
[263:28.33]That's true.
[263:32.08]Set sail in The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

[263:47.16]Oh shit.
[263:47.96]That didn't fucking work.
[263:49.94]You have to like let go at a weird spot.
[263:54.27]Here we go.
[263:58.33]Alright, not bad.
[264:00.32]I just hit my hand again.
[264:04.50]I have to crouch down or you're not going to be able to hear me.
[264:07.56]That's fine.
[264:10.83]Alright, I got to nine.
[264:15.36]Wait, what happened?
[264:20.99]I got zero points.
[264:22.41]Hold on.
[264:22.79]Why?
[264:23.65]I need to put this microphone up.
[264:26.47]I'm connected to a wire.
[264:38.13]Damn.
[264:41.65]Wait, stop.
[264:45.11]Wait, what?
[264:45.95]What's happening?
[264:46.97]I got a strike.
[264:47.71]You got a strike?
[264:50.08]Holy shit.
[264:51.56]Ooh, look at that spin.
[264:53.40]Wait, that was pretty good.
[264:56.26]All lanes done.
[265:00.85]Um... What if I do one of these?
[265:05.25]Strike!
[265:08.49]Ooh!
[265:08.95]You got a strike again.
[265:10.34]Is that what you're telling me?
[265:11.76]Yeah.
[265:12.12]Yep.
[265:13.51]Oh my god, we can see each other next to each other.
[265:16.51]I feel like I'm like praying to this thing.
[265:18.22]Whatever this is supposed to be in front of my face.
[265:22.40]Oh, I messed up.
[265:26.73]Did I win?
[265:27.11]30 to 27 right now.
[265:29.79]I'm doing good.
[265:31.96]You got two strikes in a row?
[265:34.00]I mean, you got... It's crazy that your first one got zero.
[265:37.90]And you're beating me.
[265:40.19]Oh, dude, I'm locking in.
[265:44.07]Fuck my chungus life.
[265:47.11]I'm so mad that that's on fucking camera.
[265:52.16]Yes!
[265:53.30]Spare!
[265:55.02]Alright, I still got it.
[265:57.33]I'm coming back.
[265:59.91]Spare's good.
[266:00.25]Alright, what's your technique?
[266:04.73]You just go right down the middle?
[266:07.64]Uh, yeah.
[266:10.62]Okay.
[266:12.32]Then why are you getting so many strikes?
[266:17.41]I'm just... Oh, strike roll?
[266:19.17]Different!
[266:20.35]Squeaksy.
[266:23.73]There we go.
[266:24.81]I still got it.
[266:25.58]Let's see.
[266:26.26]Did you get a strike?
[266:27.16]Yeah.
[266:30.50]I look like... I know I look really small, but I'm kneeling right now because it's the only way I can play this and I'm draining strikes over and over again.
[266:38.31]You got a strike too?
[266:39.03]Don't change anything.
[266:39.91]Don't... Yeah, I got a strike.
[266:45.55]Strike.
[266:50.50]Let's go double.
[266:53.18]That's a turkey.
[266:54.18]I got a Thanksgiving turkey.
[266:56.39]You got a strike?
[266:57.81]Yeah.
[266:59.21]Oh, yeah.
[266:59.61]How are you getting strike after strike?
[267:02.16]I'm just doing it.
[267:09.15]Wait, is this game easy?
[267:11.43]This game might be very easy.
[267:14.58]Ow, my legs hurt.
[267:21.45]First place.
[267:27.54]I'm in first place.
[267:29.18]Yeah, that's what it says.
[267:29.90]It says first place.
[267:31.50]Your title is Former Party.
[267:33.43]What does that mean?
[267:35.37]I don't know.
[267:36.57]I was a partier.
[267:38.69]Were you?
[267:40.61]Party era?
[267:42.31]Like a Mario partier?
[267:44.80]Oh!
[267:46.94]Ah!
[267:47.70]Didn't get a strike there.
[267:50.56]It means retired, yeah.
[267:54.41]Here we go.
[267:58.17]I tilted it.
[268:00.94]Sometimes it just spins on its own.
[268:03.50]I don't understand.
[268:08.94]You caught up.
[268:10.28]Alright, I gotta get a strike right here.
[268:14.43]Okay.
[268:18.47]What are we risking on this one?
[268:19.55]The same exact shit just happened again.
[268:24.80]We're risking... You have to... Get a strike in bowling in real life.
[268:34.31]And you have to record it.
[268:39.12]gonna happen.
[268:40.52]No, never.
[268:41.34]Both of us are never gonna do that.
[268:47.57]Alright, what's the score now?
[268:49.55]It's close.
[268:50.27]154, 142.
[268:51.27]This is a huge deal.
[268:56.16]Okay, last one.
[268:57.52]Good luck.
[268:59.40]Yeah!
[269:01.73]No, mine tilted.
[269:03.81]No.
[269:04.71]No.
[269:13.96]Damn, I don't know what happened.
[269:16.00]I was getting strike after strike and then completely something changed.
[269:20.35]You got one more opportunity.
[269:27.04]Beautiful.
[269:27.56]I can nail that.
[269:33.62]Come on, come on.
[269:34.45]I'm watching you.
[269:36.27]Strike.
[269:36.43]Strike.
[269:41.82]Did I win?
[269:44.39]Oh, let's freaking go.
[269:52.72]Cat dad.
[269:53.44]How do I change that?
[269:54.82]It's humiliating.
[269:57.43]How do I change that?
[269:58.43]Why did I ever set that?
[269:59.83]From what?
[270:02.37]I was on my knees the whole time.
[270:06.24]So the mic would pick up?
[270:08.36]No, because it was easier for me to go under the mic.
[270:13.48]Okay, well, okay.
[270:14.82]That was a good game.
[270:15.62]Let's do the next one.
[270:16.66]One that's not uncomfortable to play.
[270:20.87]I guess I could have prepared the room.
[270:24.13]Let's do basketball.
[270:24.83]This one sounds fun.
[270:26.55]Okay, deal.
[270:29.20]CPU strength?
[270:32.08]We're on a team with other people?
[270:35.20]Oh, yes.
[270:35.72]Two on two.
[270:36.18]I think so.
[270:37.54]Oh, people are joining.
[270:40.55]Two on two.
[270:41.19]We got Susanna and Ren.
[270:43.48]Oh, no.
[270:45.33]Select a hand to shoot with.
[270:51.43]I think it actually is just pairing us with people because that's how the game works.
[270:55.92]Oh, okay.
[270:56.60]That's fine.
[270:57.78]At least I hope so.
[271:00.75]They're just like auto-fills?
[271:03.87]Uh, people saying they're AI.
[271:08.11]Make sure you have enough space around you.
[271:11.46]God.
[271:13.51]You ever play VR?
[271:15.17]Yeah.
[271:17.23]Have you ever like... I feel like in that, I get so into it.
[271:21.03]I just like completely run into things without... I've hurt myself many times.
[271:25.60]I think if you play VR, you get hurt.
[271:27.62]Oh, okay.
[271:28.22]Yeah, big time.
[271:29.74]Oh, how do you play?
[271:30.47]Just go in the air?
[271:31.39]I think you just go in the air and shoot.
[271:34.17]Steal the ball.
[271:39.06]What the fuck is this?
[271:41.87]What do I do?
[271:43.87]It's so goofy.
[271:47.94]What the fuck?
[271:49.44]I don't even know what happened.
[271:51.30]Okay, hold on.
[271:51.86]Start dribbling.
[271:56.09]I didn't get to dunk?
[271:58.93]Wait, this one is so goofy.
[272:01.07]How do you get a pass?
[272:03.11]Steal a pass?
[272:06.23]You threw it right to him.
[272:07.74]I didn't do that.
[272:09.46]No, no, no.
[272:10.00]We got it.
[272:10.24]Why did you throw it right to him?
[272:11.89]Me?
[272:12.99]We just intercepted it.
[272:13.86]And we're on different teams.
[272:19.81]Nice.
[272:20.89]I thought we were on the same team for some reason.
[272:31.23]I just hit you in the face.
[272:34.39]I'm so sad they look so innocent.
[272:38.43]I feel so bad.
[272:40.01]Nice.
[272:40.38]Oh my god, what a block.
[272:41.90]Nice job, Susanna.
[272:43.36]Susanna.
[272:43.72]Oh, man.
[272:45.56]My teammate is not, um... Oh!
[272:50.23]Swatted away.
[272:51.39]This is bullshit.
[272:54.65]Here.
[272:54.77]Ren.
[272:56.10]I feel like we're not in control.
[272:58.08]I have not felt in control this whole time.
[273:02.40]What is this?
[273:04.96]Oh!
[273:05.89]Oh, no.
[273:07.39]No, and that's you!
[273:10.75]Boom.
[273:11.11]No.
[273:13.37]Alright, I get it.
[273:16.08]You shake the Wii mode, and that's how you dribble.
[273:24.83]Pass.
[273:26.21]I would love a pass right, but you waited until the last second.
[273:38.01]I jumped so much.
[273:39.29]What the hell was that?
[273:40.91]What was that shot?
[273:42.11]Dude, you picked me up and you threw me like I was like a baby or something.
[273:48.30]Oh my god.
[273:49.00]It's 46 seconds here.
[273:51.52]We're getting owned.
[273:52.60]Okay.
[273:53.80]Oh.
[273:55.56]Oh my god.
[273:58.59]I hate relying on our speed.
[274:01.69]Like, here we go.
[274:03.01]Hooray.
[274:03.77]Yay.
[274:04.39]Oh.
[274:06.71]this is the slowest 40 seconds ever I love it imagine seeing it imagine seeing a basketball game that was four to two there are soccer games that have more points than this for real and this is the real game it's just like going up against someone and getting it just like oh here we go boom there we go tied it up baseball is not here but this is
[274:34.64]And they added this later so they had time to develop this.
[274:39.34]And they copy strike YouTube channel.
[274:43.89]They have the time to do that.
[274:46.21]Boom.
[274:48.71]Your hair looks like a speed cycling helmet.
[274:51.87]Ban that guy.
[274:58.04]Oh my God.
[274:59.52]How do you even make shots in this game?
[275:02.10]And where's baseball?
[275:09.13]What?!
[275:10.33]That was so close!
[275:14.32]Are you on any hair regimens?
[275:17.60]Damn.
[275:19.05]Uh, eye condition?
[275:20.43]You condition?
[275:22.39]Yeah.
[275:24.31]That's so basic.
[275:27.42]Oh!
[275:29.00]Wow, what a terrible shot that was.
[275:30.82]Damn!
[275:32.28]Damn it.
[275:32.81]That was awful.
[275:33.47]I know.
[275:36.93]Aww.
[275:39.37]This is such a silly game of basketball.
[275:41.01]Alright, I'm gonna go for a shot.
[275:42.66]Ready?
[275:46.02]Are you having fun?
[275:48.10]Are you having fun?
[275:48.64]I'm trying so hard to get it over your... Susanna's gonna pass to you?
[275:57.94]What is that shot?
[275:58.94]Is there overtime?
[275:59.78]I don't know.
[276:01.46]Wait one second.
[276:02.98]Please, Red.
[276:04.68]Ren doesn't even shoot it at the shot clock.
[276:08.13]Oh my god.
[276:11.79]I would not clap.
[276:13.07]None of them should be clapping.
[276:14.59]We're not playing this.
[276:15.41]We're skipping the basketball one.
[276:20.06]Obviously.
[276:22.00]Obviously.
[276:26.48]Sorry?
[276:27.95]I think there's another game mode.
[276:31.61]In basketball?
[276:32.33]I think so, yeah.
[276:33.13]Look.
[276:35.48]Oh wait, is it not?
[276:37.20]I thought there was.
[276:37.72]I can't see your screen in this one.
[276:39.43]Isn't there another game mode?
[276:41.87]Apparently there's a three-point contest.
[276:43.47]That's what I'm saying.
[276:44.37]Isn't there a three-point contest?
[276:46.27]I looked at this.
[276:51.28]Is it solo only?
[276:53.66]It's only local?
[277:02.92]Alright, let's go.
[277:04.18]Come to New York.
[277:05.22]We're going to play the three-point contest.
[277:07.29]Let's do tennis.
[277:08.91]Yeah, classic.
[277:10.53]Thank God they added tennis.
[277:13.15]Dude, tennis on the Wii Sports was so fun.
[277:17.04]Yeah, let's see if it's any good on this piece of shit.
[277:20.49]Yeah.
[277:22.59]Yeah, what happened?
[277:23.21]I feel like it's so easy to make a Nintendo sports game.
[277:26.35]Like, what are they doing?
[277:28.06]Even Mario Strikers on the GameCube was so fun.
[277:31.69]Mario Strikers for the GameCube is probably one of the best sports games ever made.
[277:34.89]Yeah.
[277:36.78]I don't know if it's any good on the Twitch.
[277:38.50]Let's see if this holds up.
[277:39.92]Already don't like it.
[277:40.72]We have two ghost characters.
[277:42.44]Already hate it.
[277:43.53]I hate this.
[277:44.31]I hate it.
[277:44.69]This is like the Gooigi version of us.
[277:47.17]Oh my god, wait.
[277:47.79]The tracking is cool.
[277:48.89]I'm ready.
[277:51.32]Is this like one where you have to actually swing?
[277:54.60]Go.
[277:54.98]Yeah!
[277:57.93]Good!
[278:03.97]Get the ghost.
[278:04.51]I don't want the ghost character.
[278:06.64]My arm hurts.
[278:15.60]Okay, wait.
[278:15.93]This is awesome.
[278:19.13]Oh, no.
[278:20.11]No.
[278:21.91]Yes.
[278:23.75]What is that hit?
[278:24.79]Nah, don't worry.
[278:25.82]Everything's fine.
[278:27.40]It must have been your computer.
[278:28.64]Oh, my God.
[278:29.34]It was probably your computer.
[278:33.88]Wait, did you see that hit?
[278:35.70]Yeah, I did.
[278:36.44]Did you see my dive?
[278:37.92]See what I'm talking about?
[278:46.59]This is insane.
[278:56.02]It's so glitchy.
[278:57.40]I love this.
[279:01.33]Oh.
[279:02.56]And how come they don't go, love 30.
[279:04.36]40 on.
[279:07.69]Where is the narrator?
[279:09.37]Where's the silliness?
[279:11.23]Where's the me's?
[279:12.83]These look like Bratz dolls.
[279:16.32]Oh.
[279:17.36]No.
[279:20.28]I think it's all based on timing.
[279:23.19]This game sucks.
[279:24.21]This game sucks.
[279:25.19]This game sucks.
[279:26.69]Look at us.
[279:27.07]We're like...
[279:28.15]We should just play the Wii.
[279:30.83]We should do a Wii Sports Day next.
[279:34.45]Let's do it again.
[279:36.38]Do you want to do a Wii Sports Day?
[279:38.18]Yeah, you want to go across the whole country to do that?
[279:41.04]Yeah, I'm down.
[279:42.29]That'd be kind of fun.
[279:43.49]That'd be super fun.
[279:45.85]There's so many random Wii Sports games.
[279:49.74]Wait, Jeremiah, have you ever played the Burger King games?
[279:52.04]Oh, yeah.
[279:53.84]Those are so good.
[279:55.05]I 100% am one of those on stream.
[279:58.08]Which one?
[279:58.58]Did you do pocket bike racing?
[280:00.03]Sneak King.
[280:01.79]Oh, Sneak King is really good.
[280:03.22]I got every single achievement.
[280:04.40]I got the platinum achievement on it.
[280:05.59]And I remember I got like two or three thousand unfollows that day.
[280:11.97]So people like tuned in.
[280:13.77]They're like, let's try out what this Jerma guy's all about.
[280:15.94]And then they saw you playing sneaking for like 13 hours.
[280:19.24]And they're like, no, it was, it was a six, it was 17 hours over two days.
[280:22.81]And I remember actually getting an email, one of my old email that was like, Hey man, like I've been a fan of yours for a while, but like, don't do shit like that.
[280:29.54]It's like boring and everyone hates it.
[280:33.06]And I just went out of their way to email you that.
[280:35.46]And I just went, I replied and I just wrote LOL.
[280:38.23]That's it.
[280:39.86]That probably, that's so mean.
[280:44.21]Oh!
[280:44.77]See ya!
[280:47.75]LOL.
[280:51.50]I can't imagine unfollowing.
[280:53.22]Isn't that so, don't you think that's like based?
[280:54.70]That's so diabolical.
[280:56.90]For one stream.
[280:58.69]Unfollowed.
[280:59.43]What did your chat say?
[281:00.19]Did your chat think it was funny?
[281:03.09]Oh no, I've never streamed it.
[281:04.07]No, no, but like what I just said.
[281:05.99]Do you think there's like a chat move, what I just said?
[281:09.26]Yeah, totally, Chad.
[281:10.56]Thanks.
[281:11.12]They loved it.
[281:11.78]A lot of plus twos.
[281:13.16]A lot of omega lols.
[281:18.79]A lot of Ws, too.
[281:20.95]Oh, that's good.
[281:21.69]Gigachads.
[281:22.47]Gigachads.

[281:28.84]I was very impressed.

[281:37.88]Like you wrote it out.
[281:39.20]You said something like, happy, excited, poggy face, like dancing or something.
[281:47.95]I just want to feel included.
[281:49.59]I don't even know how I hit that.
[281:54.20]I probably wrote, I don't know, probably like thinking face or something, right?
[282:00.38]No, I could pull up your logs.
[282:01.97]Don't do that, man.

[282:58.20]Wait, okay.
[282:58.70]Can we do... Why am I getting distracted?
[283:02.17]I'm so novice of me.
[283:04.73]I wrote the letter B?
[283:06.50]Yeah, you wrote capital B. No, you wrote capital B. I don't know.
[283:13.61]Like you wrote the word capital B. Go 10 messages before that.
[283:16.88]We got to go again.
[283:17.50]10 messages?
[283:19.28]Go 10 messages before that.
[283:20.34]No, no, I'm not falling for this.
[283:23.35]I'm not doing this.
[283:24.81]Like, why am I?
[283:26.17]Obviously, I'm not falling for this.
[283:29.74]Dude, you're demented.
[283:30.77]Hey.
[283:33.25]Not you.
[283:34.95]Somebody said that to me.
[283:37.19]Listen, I know it's all fun and games here, but you gotta relax.
[283:40.33]It's just tennis.
[283:41.44]Out.
[283:55.23]Wait, you actually hate this?
[283:57.15]No, this is actually kind of fun.
[283:58.65]Yeah, it's good.
[284:01.47]Oh, we got a beautiful volley.
[284:03.59]Oh, that's out.
[284:06.24]Watch that replay.
[284:06.82]It wasn't on the line.
[284:08.84]Referee.
[284:09.94]Check this out.
[284:11.43]Doink.
[284:12.07]Oh, that was completely out.
[284:15.37]That was completely out.
[284:18.18]Okay.
[284:19.00]That's how you want to win, huh?
[284:22.38]Anything for the victory.
[284:23.11]Anything.
[284:26.27]There we go.
[284:26.97]Boom.
[284:28.79]See, my guys are diving for it.
[284:30.39]I can't imagine why that doesn't count.
[284:36.62]Sure does.
[284:39.29]That's actually not even close.
[284:45.18]Oh.
[284:47.60]Watch this come back.
[284:48.38]I actually promise I come back.
[284:53.03]Oh.
[284:53.27]Oh.
[284:53.67]Oh, my God.
[284:54.93]Oh, what?
[284:56.89]Yes.
[284:58.17]Yes.
[284:58.37]Would have been sick.
[284:59.53]I'm still in it.
[285:00.84]That was a mistake.
[285:07.87]That was a rookie move.
[285:08.79]Come on.
[285:09.23]Absolute rookie move.
[285:09.69]That would have been crazy.
[285:10.89]That would have been crazy.
[285:13.84]Okay.
[285:14.14]Good luck.
[285:23.23]That was a rookie move too.
[285:25.01]I didn't want to hit my microphone.
[285:26.89]Hold on.
[285:27.09]Oh my god.
[285:27.79]That's the difference between you and me.
[285:29.58]You gotta sacrifice it all for the win.
[285:32.30]We ain't in the little leagues anymore.
[285:33.94]Bruh.
[285:38.14]Oh my god.
[285:49.56]Yes!
[285:51.84]Oh no.
[285:53.87]So much pressure.
[285:56.92]Hey, hey, listen, Jerma, no matter what happens, good luck.
[286:00.62]Like, let's just... Oh my god!
[286:03.59]I'm such a fool!
[286:04.71]Dare I even say I'm a bozo.
[286:10.19]Yeah, you are.
[286:12.26]Oh, you're supposed to say no, you're not.
[286:13.96]Ugh!
[286:16.16]Damn.
[286:18.78]Oh!
[286:20.79]You hit the net!
[286:26.07]Okay.
[286:27.01]Dial in.
[286:27.55]How come you get to serve this entire time?
[286:29.84]Giga chat.
[286:32.84]Giga chat.
[286:36.95]Oh my god!
[286:39.01]Yes!
[286:40.54]You didn't read the manual of tennis?
[286:44.36]Only if during a serve, you're not allowed to.
[286:48.85]Only on the serve.
[286:58.42]My ghost is such a fool.
[287:09.58]I'm glad he's a ghost.
[287:14.34]Are you implying that he's dead?
[287:15.86]You're glad he's dead?
[287:18.33]Yeah.
[287:21.87]Okay, how come you get to serve?
[287:26.70]Right?
[287:28.51]Am I just crazy or does this feel rigged?
[287:31.27]Let's watch that again one more time.
[287:33.39]Do you guys feel like this is like... That was a well-earned win, though, for real.
[287:39.62]Actually, W. I don't mind.
[287:42.89]Can we switch sides?
[287:44.55]Can we switch sides?
[287:50.02]How do we switch sides?
[287:51.70]Oh, I don't know.
[287:52.24]That's okay.
[287:54.72]If it's hard, it's all good.
[287:56.76]He's going to hold that against me for the rest of my life.
[288:00.34]I will.
[288:00.98]I'll say, remember when you didn't let me serve?
[288:04.21]Why am I serving every time, though?
[288:06.17]Yeah.
[288:08.73]That is a little unfair.
[288:11.11]This is unfair.
[288:12.92]Oh, you have to do best of three.
[288:14.20]Oh, because you stole.
[288:16.74]There's no way to do a single where I serve.
[288:20.36]I guess not.
[288:23.25]Okay, well, I can just come back here.
[288:24.72]Yeah.
[288:27.02]Oh, sure, Mom.
[288:29.14]What?
[288:29.60]It just wasn't fair that you couldn't serve.
[288:31.45]Oh, okay.
[288:36.29]It wasn't fair.
[288:37.75]Yeah, out of fair play.
[288:40.19]Hey, you want to play volleyball?
[288:42.78]Yeah, you hate volleyball.
[288:44.78]Hooray.
[288:45.88]You say 0.0.
[288:46.74]0.0.
[288:47.36]Yeah, but what if you have fun?
[288:50.28]You're going to have to go back on your word.
[288:51.78]That'll be a 0.1.
[288:53.69]Okay, we have teammates.
[288:56.04]Okay.
[288:56.16]Okay, I want you to give, like, a very fair assessment.
[288:58.46]I will.
[288:58.68]Like, let's play this with a completely fresh palette.
[289:01.80]Because this might surprise you.
[289:03.03]Maybe, you know, you might change your mind.
[289:07.67]Maybe a 0.1.
[289:09.41]I will give it a fair assessment.
[289:10.76]I don't like any volleyball games that I've ever released.
[289:14.84]Okay, do you like volleyball in, like, real life?
[289:16.66]Yeah, I think it's cool.
[289:18.41]Okay.
[289:18.93]Okay.
[289:19.31]But not the games.
[289:20.41]I think the games, it just doesn't do it for me at all.
[289:24.14]Okay, don't stand too close to the television here.
[289:27.12]Okay, I'm gonna move the mic.
[289:31.29]My pants are riding all the... My thighs are all completely exposed.
[289:35.55]If the camera was pointing down, this would be a disaster.
[289:39.70]My shorts have rid all the way up my ass at this point.
[289:41.70]I'm wearing, like, sweatpants.
[289:43.14]I look like an idiot.
[289:45.09]Alright, so we go... Wait, how do you play?
[289:49.85]Find out.
[289:56.54]Oh, you have to move?
[290:00.32]Oh, bumped it!
[290:01.32]That was a good bump.
[290:02.04]Actually, good bump.
[290:03.91]Wait, why was I just standing there?
[290:05.17]Oh.
[290:06.51]Okay, you gotta jump.
[290:08.99]Wait, I actually really like this.
[290:11.65]I'll give you an assessment.
[290:15.10]Oh yeah, you're right.
[290:15.76]I can't give you a bias.
[290:23.87]Good block.
[290:25.33]That was actually good.
[290:33.56]hell was that oh my god zero wait we're not over yet again who knows what will happen this time right that's right I I can't help but to notice like I feel like when you lose the game it ruins your enjoyment just a little bit no not really no that's nothing to do with it gotcha
[291:00.43]0.5!
[291:06.07]Completely unrelated to the point, right?
[291:13.54]Oh!
[291:17.87]Nice!
[291:18.79]What are you doing, Midori?
[291:19.99]Get over there!

[291:25.09]You just did the Daria.
[291:27.58]Don't Daria me, please.
[291:30.90]Trying her hardest.
[291:32.80]Oh my god, what a... She's insane.
[291:36.21]That was an insane spike.
[291:37.55]That was pretty good.
[291:39.19]That was amazing.
[291:43.78]Okay, let's see what my CPU's got.
[291:47.84]Terrible.
[291:48.85]That was so slow.

[292:20.43]I'll tell you... I hate this game.
[292:23.46]I'm pretending to have fun right now, but it is fun.
[292:25.68]Yeah.
[292:27.24]You're pretending to have fun, but it's fun?
[292:29.71]That should not have gotten that.

[293:39.31]I was distracting you and it distracted me instead.
[293:45.98]Oh yeah, what's your ideal lunch?
[293:50.77]Chicken parm sandwich with a dusting of parmesan cheese.
[293:55.48]Buffalo chicken.
[293:56.12]Just a dusting, but it's a chicken parm.
[293:58.56]Buffalo chicken sandwich.
[293:59.82]Buffalo chicken sub with crispy buffalo chicken with blue cheese all over it.
[294:05.88]Oh my God.
[294:06.90]Yeah.
[294:07.10]That's like very specific.
[294:08.62]Good stuff.
[294:09.25]Okay.
[294:09.39]Let's not play that piece of fucking junk ever again.
[294:13.91]So 0.0.
[294:14.59]You hate volleyball.
[294:17.81]It was fun.
[294:18.23]It was fun.
[294:18.98]Oh, you can be honest.
[294:19.74]You hated it.
[294:21.40]I can feel it.
[294:21.96]I sense it.
[294:22.84]Let's do weird volleyball.
[294:26.78]What's weird volleyball?
[294:28.23]Badminton?
[294:29.09]Yeah.
[294:31.21]Wait, didn't we play badminton the other one?
[294:33.76]Would you call it shuttlecock?
[294:36.86]Whatever, something about joycock.
[294:41.33]It's not joycock, it's shuttlecock.
[294:46.09]Okay, good luck.
[294:48.89]I can't imagine this one is different than tennis.
[294:52.82]I actually like badminton.
[294:54.66]You can hit the ball as hard as you can and it just goes... It just completely loses all its momentum.
[295:01.05]You're right.
[295:01.55]I love it.
[295:02.07]I kind of like it.
[295:04.54]Do you play pickleball?
[295:07.06]I've heard of it.
[295:07.80]It's fun.
[295:08.74]You've never played it?
[295:09.73]I played it in an old gym class.
[295:13.81]Here we go.
[295:15.23]It's like something I like doing.
[295:17.66]Why did I fall down?
[295:21.56]No, what the hell was this?
[295:24.45]What do you mean?
[295:24.99]You didn't even get up.
[295:26.59]I hit my mouth on the ground.
[295:30.00]Wait, is your...
[295:31.71]Is your thing like calibrated?
[295:33.65]You have to point at the screen and hit X. Oh, yeah, I go.
[295:36.01]I'm good.
[295:38.21]Yeah.
[295:40.42]Oh.
[295:44.16]And this might be my sport.
[295:45.74]This is a ten out of ten for me.
[295:46.98]I'm glad.
[295:50.91]Now I'm the server.
[295:54.23]Are you ready?
[296:02.56]So, have you played Call of Duty?
[296:06.50]Yeah, my KD ratio was 0.2.
[296:09.75]Oh my god.
[296:17.28]This one's a 2.
[296:17.96]I'm telling you.
[296:20.08]This one's a 2 out of 10.
[296:21.82]I'm talking like so much shit about this.
[296:23.57]This is fun.
[296:24.09]I like it.
[296:26.29]You hate it.
[296:27.37]It's so obvious.
[296:28.61]I can tell.
[296:32.93]There we go.
[296:37.60]I feel like... I don't feel like I'm in control.
[296:44.83]Oh, there we go.
[296:46.49]There we go.
[296:48.70]We should play zombies in COD.
[296:52.02]That's the good stuff.
[296:53.52]They keep making new ones, right?
[296:56.11]There's a new Call of Duty every two years.
[296:58.15]Is the last one any good?
[297:00.05]Um, not really.
[297:01.67]Was it Call of Duty Destroy the World or something?
[297:03.87]What was it called?
[297:05.61]Black Ops 2.
[297:06.47]I think it was Black Ops 4 that just came out.
[297:09.72]Oh, was it?
[297:10.66]I think they remade... Wait.
[297:13.62]Someone correct me.
[297:14.46]Didn't they remake the second Black... Oh, no.
[297:19.67]Black Ops 6.
[297:20.61]Sorry.
[297:23.05]Black Ops 6?
[297:23.39]I know.
[297:24.29]And then they, like, have remade the old game mode.
[297:26.81]Call of Duty 2025.
[297:31.39]Same thing with Nintendo.
[297:33.05]Call of Duty 2K5.
[297:36.13]Yeah, but then when like moms are buying their kid Call of Duty, they'll be like, oh, can we get the one from 2025?
[297:40.76]Yeah.
[297:42.04]That'd be so easy.
[297:44.68]Yeah.
[297:45.36]You got to do your research.
[297:47.73]I guess.
[297:48.83]Or like you can't go back.
[297:50.47]Like it just has to be a number.
[297:52.45]Like Call of Duty 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[297:55.34]It should be illegal.
[297:57.64]Like the Jason movies.
[298:00.58]What do you mean Jason?
[298:01.36]Jason 1?
[298:02.00]Like the Jason movies.
[298:03.08]It's like Jason 14 or something, right?
[298:06.17]I don't know what the Jason movies are.
[298:09.19]Jason?
[298:11.19]What's Jason?
[298:12.22]You don't know what the Jason... Hold on.
[298:15.38]Jason the horror movie.
[298:19.19]I don't know the Jason horror movie.
[298:20.89]Jason!
[298:21.67]Jason 1, Jason 2.
[298:22.83]Oh, it's Friday the 13th.
[298:24.31]Friday the 13th 1.
[298:25.36]Oh!
[298:25.58]Oh!
[298:28.30]It's not Jason.
[298:29.67]Oh, I know Friday the 13th.
[298:31.67]Friday the 13th.
[298:32.49]Yeah, I know that.
[298:33.95]Friday the 13th one.
[298:36.24]Okay, wait.
[298:36.74]I'm so confused.
[298:37.94]I guess, like, Jason 1, 2, 3.
[298:39.46]Aren't they called the Jason movies?
[298:42.09]Like, oh, yeah, the Jason movies, right?
[298:44.93]I've never heard anyone refer to Friday the 13th the Jason movies.
[298:49.23]Yeah, right.
[298:50.15]This weekend, do you want to see the Jason movies?
[298:53.46]Yeah, that's cool.
[298:54.86]No, I've never heard that.
[298:56.34]If you said, hey, bro, hey, we're going to play Wii Sports and let's do a marathon of the Jason movies, I'd be like, holy shit.
[299:02.45]Yeah, one, two, three, four, five.
[299:03.59]Those are the good ones.
[299:04.93]I've never heard that.
[299:06.39]Jason X was the only one.
[299:09.80]Yeah, well, at least they did it once.
[299:13.50]Yeah, but I mean, that completely is contrary to your point.
[299:19.72]The point is that Jason X, Jason 11, Jason 12, Jason 13.
[299:23.15]Hey, Final Fantasy figured this out 40 years ago.
[299:27.51]Yeah, true, but it sucks for people like me who are too stupid to understand Roman numerals.
[299:33.14]Like, whenever I see a Final Fantasy, like, in writing, I'm looking at my friends, I'm like, which one is this?
[299:38.41]16?
[299:42.79]The last one was pretty good.
[299:43.91]The music was awesome.
[299:45.73]Oh, yeah.
[299:47.58]How do you fire?
[299:48.92]I love the remake.
[299:50.60]I've been playing the remake, actually.
[299:52.30]I keep hearing it's good.
[299:53.22]Is it good?
[299:54.51]It's really good.
[299:55.61]They did a good job.
[299:57.55]Oh, my God.
[299:57.91]Wait.
[299:59.73]Soccer?
[299:59.89]Wait.
[300:00.31]One-on-one soccer?
[300:01.73]It's just Rocket League, dude.
[300:02.98]This is literally Rocket League with humans.
[300:04.76]Watch.
[300:06.36]Yeah.
[300:06.82]They just clearly copied.
[300:08.56]It actually is because there's no kick.
[300:10.37]It's Rocket League, but you're a person.
[300:13.74]Just pretend that you're a car.
[300:17.92]Oh my god.
[300:18.40]I actually just- Wait, you can't kick!
[300:23.31]Wait, you actually can't kick.
[300:24.59]That's what I'm telling you.
[300:26.31]This is so goofy.
[300:29.08]Where are you, by the way?
[300:30.16]Where is you- Why did you run away?
[300:31.52]I got- There's a jump.
[300:34.64]There's a jump.
[300:36.73]Try jumping?
[300:40.29]Wait, how'd you do that?
[300:41.07]You can kick.
[300:44.52]It's just soccer.
[300:47.20]No, this is Rocket League.
[300:50.81]Wait, I'm out of stamina.
[300:53.53]You can't tell me this is not Rocket League.
[300:55.05]This is not soccer.
[300:57.84]Boom.
[301:01.28]No, 100%.
[301:01.86]You're right.
[301:03.94]Oh, my God.
[301:05.25]Wait.
[301:05.53]See, this is where I'm, like, I'm mushing your controller.
[301:08.67]I'm reaching over and, like, grabbing your controller and shit.
[301:11.35]Yeah, no.
[301:12.45]Nope.
[301:12.57]Um...
[301:14.54]Oh my god, wait.
[301:16.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[301:17.32]I'm out of stamina.
[301:18.50]Is it violence?
[301:20.77]Don't, no, no, no.
[301:21.73]It's Nintendo.
[301:23.69]We're so bad.
[301:33.44]Own goal.
[301:34.04]Why did you skip the replay?
[301:36.28]Oh shit, I did.
[301:37.35]I did skip it, you're right.
[301:39.97]That was rage skipped it.
[301:41.79]You ready?
[301:42.15]Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.
[301:50.21]Alright, good luck.
[301:53.66]How do you aim?
[301:54.00]You fucked that up so bad.
[301:55.44]How do you aim?
[301:56.38]I don't get it.
[302:02.07]Come on, do it.
[302:03.69]40 seconds, dude.
[302:05.37]Oh my god, the ball's going crazy.
[302:10.24]Back!
[302:14.74]Oh my god, you can put your whole body into it.
[302:16.75]Oh, careful!
[302:21.80]You had such a good setup right there, too.
[302:24.95]No, I got it.
[302:25.73]I have the perfect setup.
[302:28.59]Oh, shit.
[302:30.69]Don't!
[302:31.11]Yeah!
[302:36.44]No!
[302:37.22]It's nine seconds!
[302:39.26]Oh, it's heartbreaking.
[302:40.74]No.
[302:44.08]How come I can't skip the replay?
[302:45.52]Why didn't I just... I drank that like an alien.
[302:47.85]That was weird.
[302:48.43]It's gonna hold Joy-Cons.
[302:50.71]Good luck.
[302:53.19]Oh, it's actually terrible.
[302:55.68]Okay, we got to play this again, obviously.
[302:59.90]Oh, right at the buzzer.
[303:01.70]Oh, it didn't count.
[303:02.61]Yeah, we're definitely doing this one again, for sure.
[303:04.39]Yeah, now I get how to play.
[303:06.15]This one is a high ranking, by the way.
[303:07.75]This is a good one.
[303:08.50]A lot.
[303:09.08]Good.
[303:09.44]This is a good one?
[303:10.24]Oh, yeah.
[303:12.82]Okay, where are you putting it on your list?
[303:14.80]Top, like, out of ten.
[303:18.05]In this particular game right now, this is probably like a nine.
[303:22.96]Holy shit.
[303:24.06]Yeah, this is probably like an 8.6.
[303:27.04]Out of 10?
[303:28.05]Yeah.
[303:28.23]I think they're supposed to have more players.
[303:31.11]Like, I think this would be like a 3v3.
[303:32.95]I think it's fun just one-on-one.
[303:34.12]It's good.
[303:37.34]Right, and nothing to do with you winning.
[303:38.78]No, not at all.
[303:40.63]Right.
[303:41.37]Yeah!
[303:43.17]Oh, shit.
[303:44.31]Wait, you're good at this.
[303:45.93]You're actually good at this.
[303:47.20]Crazy.
[303:47.70]I didn't even watch it go in because of this thing.
[303:49.32]Fucked up.

[304:42.18]I don't have to do anything.
[304:46.45]Oh.
[304:47.55]You've missed the setup.
[304:48.89]It was right there.
[304:49.64]You had it.
[304:51.33]How do you aim?
[304:51.97]I feel like it doesn't go where I'm aiming.
[304:59.67]Oh, good block.
[305:04.96]Oh, shit.
[305:09.46]No.
[305:12.15]Dude, this golden ball is everything to me.

[305:21.69]Dude, I don't understand this one.
[305:25.62]I don't get it.

[305:29.61]Hey, it is a ball that I have to throw at something.
[305:34.26]Wait, that's insane.
[305:36.17]I got destroyed.

[305:45.48]You kicked my behind in Checkers.
[305:49.64]Remember?
[305:50.14]Do you remember that?
[305:50.68]That felt like 15 years ago.
[305:52.97]That was so long ago.
[305:54.45]That was like four breaks ago, Jerma.
[305:56.65]It was.
[306:00.13]Yahtzee?

[309:44.81]I can't believe it.
[309:47.07]Sneakers and underwear.
[309:47.87]He's going grocery shopping again every day.

[309:52.25]Out the door once again.
[309:54.13]Hey, you kicked the shit out of me in golf.
[309:56.09]Remember that.
[309:58.85]Yeah, but that was completely different.
[310:00.42]That was a top-down perspective.
[310:02.88]I think you got the power down, the swing power and the timing and stuff.
[310:08.12]I think you got it.
[310:09.56]Okay, you're right.
[310:10.79]I have to be more confident.
[310:12.13]You should be more confident.
[310:14.03]You know what?
[310:14.49]I needed to hear that.
[310:15.67]And I think that you should be more confident and you should get to it after these messages.
[310:21.80]Oh my god, it's been an hour again?
[310:23.44]It's been an hour again, yep.
[310:25.00]Time is freaking flying!

[310:56.67]I was just giving us a joke.
[310:57.70]We're just kidding.
[310:58.32]We're just... I'm just giving them a little punch.
[311:02.67]I'll be back in like three or four minutes.
[311:04.29]Ads will start in about 45 seconds.
[311:06.90]Maybe.
[315:45.83]Hello?

[315:47.25]We did it exactly again.
[315:49.05]I just sat down.
[315:50.45]That's impossible.
[315:52.56]What do you mean?

[316:49.70]I am, yeah.
[316:51.86]And it matters, by the way.
[316:54.46]It does.
[316:54.81]It's fun.
[316:55.31]Germites being so mean today.
[316:59.99]Jesus.
[317:01.70]First time chatter.
[317:05.85]They said that over on my channel, too.
[317:08.80]I think it's the same person.
[317:10.76]You think so?
[317:14.45]You really rubbed that guy the wrong way for some reason.
[317:17.63]You think that guy's like Model Libra?
[317:19.99]They probably went over to your channel.
[317:24.00]Jesus.
[317:24.68]No, this has been fun.
[317:25.66]This has been actually a lot of fun.
[317:28.03]Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
[317:30.97]Okay, golfing.
[317:34.20]This is your expertise.
[317:36.12]This is my expertise.
[317:37.29]I've taken golfing lessons before.
[317:39.13]Actually?
[317:41.47]Yeah, like for when I worked the job.
[317:47.06]Okay, I'm ready.
[317:49.58]Oh, we have to stand up for this one.
[317:51.66]Oh, okay.
[317:54.77]Okay.
[317:55.65]I don't know if you can hear me.
[317:57.61]I can still hear you.
[317:58.99]Can you hear me?
[318:00.15]Yeah, yeah.
[318:03.82]Alright, point the controller down.
[318:09.19]Okay.
[318:10.77]Here we go.
[318:12.69]Oh, shit.
[318:17.28]What, um... A driver.
[318:19.90]I'm not even... Where's the ball?
[318:21.72]You have to hold ZR.
[318:24.85]Here we go.
[318:26.71]Where are you going?
[318:28.23]Stay on your own...
[318:30.77]Get off my screen!
[318:32.43]That was gonna go up your ass, by the way.
[318:35.89]That was gonna be like a gloody tune.
[318:39.04]Like, it's crazy.
[318:39.72]You're like, get off my side.
[318:42.42]Can I actually hit you?
[318:44.40]No.

[319:00.11]Oh, actually, no, never mind, never mind.
[319:01.37]I'm good.
[319:02.25]Mine's better.
[319:02.77]Is mine better?
[319:03.26]No, yours is better.
[319:03.98]Mine's better.
[319:04.38]Mine's better.
[319:04.82]Yours is way better.
[319:08.00]There we go.
[319:08.82]Wait, I'm a born golfer here.
[319:12.74]Okay, here we go.
[319:18.81]Oh, shit.
[319:22.35]Why does it tilt to the freaking left?
[319:25.81]What are you supposed to do?
[319:27.75]I don't know.
[319:29.78]Can I look over here for a second?
[319:32.06]How do I get out of this?
[319:33.78]Where are you?
[319:34.46]I was doing a funny thing.
[319:35.34]Okay, now we're good.
[319:37.89]Oh, okay.
[319:38.37]I see you.
[319:42.85]Nice shot.
[319:44.81]Oh, my God.
[319:45.96]Nice shot.
[319:46.52]That sucked ass.
[319:47.10]Where's that going to land?
[319:47.98]What?
[319:48.16]It was awful.
[319:48.82]What in the sand?
[319:51.00]Nice.
[319:51.86]On.
[319:54.45]Here we go.
[320:04.27]Good.
[320:08.64]I just can't.
[320:09.32]I can't do it.
[320:10.90]You can do it.
[320:11.34]Yes, I can.
[320:11.76]Yes, you can.
[320:12.16]Yes, I can.
[320:12.78]Dude.
[320:20.47]Boom.
[320:23.22]Did you just block my ball?
[320:24.76]No, I saw you.
[320:25.92]Did we get a replay of that?
[320:27.04]You blocked my ball.
[320:29.02]No, I didn't.
[320:29.68]Did I?
[320:30.30]Yes, you did.
[320:30.82]Referee.
[320:32.13]100%.
[320:33.13]What?
[320:34.88]I got a bogey.
[320:36.99]I got a bogey.
[320:38.71]Hey, if I didn't try to hit the ball at your character three times, I would have probably won that hole.
[320:44.20]Wait, what did you get?
[320:45.88]Oh, plus four.
[320:47.16]I swung three times and hit the ball the other direction.
[320:52.13]You're trying to kill me.
[320:53.15]That's a well-earned plus four.
[320:55.01]This is a 9.5.
[320:55.88]Yeah, this is incredible.
[320:58.62]I'm excited to play Mario Golf at some point.
[321:03.50]Oh, that's right.
[321:03.90]We have that one.
[321:04.60]Yeah.
[321:04.88]Alright, this time, here we go.
[321:08.65]You ready?

[321:16.20]That's going into the fucking trees.
[321:17.36]Oh, I got a nice shot.
[321:18.68]I thought you were saying nice shot to me being a dick.
[321:22.26]No, not to me.
[321:22.96]What, do you think I'm some evil guy?
[321:24.95]Nice shot, you fool.
[321:31.19]What the fuck?
[321:33.96]I gotta wedge it.
[321:36.91]Oh, I fucked up big time.
[321:42.66]This is hard.
[321:45.30]Are you okay?
[321:49.89]Sink it!
[321:50.98]Get in there!
[321:52.66]Oh no.
[322:01.42]Oh, somebody... That was a far putt though.
[322:06.60]I don't have control over my Joy-Con.
[322:11.03]I don't understand it.
[322:13.63]You're gonna have to drag it around.
[322:18.10]You have to drag it with the end of the club.
[322:20.78]I'm trying to be so delicate.
[322:22.74]Okay, there we go.
[322:29.71]There we go.
[322:31.24]I'll come back here.
[322:32.50]I'll come back.
[322:35.34]Oh, I'm on a hill.
[322:36.38]Yeah, you're on a hill.
[322:37.20]You have to compensate for it.
[322:40.37]Okay, okay.
[322:42.47]Plus four.
[322:44.17]It's fine.
[322:46.71]We're tied.

[322:49.11]Okay, we got this.
[322:50.66]I feel confident.
[322:54.40]Plus, oh yeah, we're exactly tied.
[322:58.44]Is this a three-hole game?
[322:59.95]I think it's, yeah, three-hole.
[323:02.20]Best of luck.
[323:04.94]You leave it all on the line.
[323:06.17]Good luck.
[323:07.35]This one looks like a doozy.
[323:12.01]Wow, this is beautiful.
[323:21.12]Jesus.
[323:25.69]Get over there.
[323:27.15]Through the leaf.
[323:33.79]Nice.
[323:37.77]There we go.
[323:38.81]Beautiful.
[323:45.12]Stop.

[323:49.16]What even hit a tree?
[323:50.04]It says hit a tree, dot, dot, dot.
[323:53.99]That's like the meanest use of ellipses I've ever seen.
[323:56.41]Destructio hit a tree, dot, dot, dot.
[324:01.72]Ouch.
[324:02.85]Oh, wait, do I go through this tree?

[324:47.06]Wait.
[324:54.87]Okay.
[324:57.03]This is hard.
[324:58.06]This is so difficult.
[324:59.96]I'm gonna get the W here.
[325:03.77]Yeah, right.
[325:05.23]You hit a tree.
[325:10.06]What the fuck are you talking about?
[325:11.98]Did you see how slow I did that?
[325:14.40]Come on!

[325:47.31]Wait, did you hit it?
[325:48.01]What was hitting a pole?
[325:49.61]I saw like a notification.
[325:50.87]What did that mean?
[325:51.95]My fly has been down the whole time, dude.
[325:54.09]It's so embarrassing.
[325:57.18]That's humiliating.

[326:03.52]Germomod, delete the VOD.
[326:04.78]Delete the clips.
[326:06.65]No.

[329:58.52]You shouldn't.
[329:59.92]Ready?
[330:00.38]I don't.
[330:05.65]Nope.
[330:06.31]Oh, my gosh.
[330:07.03]Somebody got blocked.
[330:08.57]Oh, someone got blocked.
[330:19.36]No.
[330:20.81]Why do you have two swords?
[330:21.93]It's not fair.
[330:23.70]Oh, no.
[330:25.02]Because I'm a dual welder.
[330:28.39]A dual welder?
[330:29.57]Well, I respect the profession.
[330:33.11]Good for you.
[330:36.04]Did we both read our chats at the same time on how to block, by the way?
[330:42.42]Yes.
[330:43.14]Just Libra stuff, you know?
[330:45.43]Yeah, we're so cosmically connected.
[330:52.98]Boom.
[330:53.76]Let's freaking go.
[330:55.34]Time to juggle.
[330:56.46]Finish.
[330:57.33]Juggle your joy cons.
[331:00.39]Nice.
[331:00.63]Everyone's waiting to see it.
[331:06.08]This one's fun.
[331:07.72]Yeah, that one was really good.
[331:10.42]Do I get to choose my weapon?
[331:14.05]Oh, you should.
[331:15.03]It's one of three different... Oh, maybe we have to go back out.
[331:18.76]I'm okay with these.
[331:19.94]I mean, I'm okay with my single wield.
[331:21.84]It's okay.
[331:26.09]I actually really like the look of my guy.
[331:27.57]Don't knock that over.
[331:31.57]Okay, good luck.
[331:32.27]The first rule of any type of fighting is to make sure you can withstand punishment.
[331:50.13]Whoa, you're so brave.
[331:52.56]How about you withstand punishment for one more round?
[331:55.74]Ready?
[331:57.00]And now, you will see what I mean.
[332:01.54]Okay.
[332:01.66]Oh my god, how'd you know?
[332:02.72]K.O.
[332:14.68]Finish.
[332:17.98]How come I didn't block it?
[332:18.90]I don't know if there's a way to block that for some reason.
[332:23.32]I thought I could.
[332:25.40]I thought so, too.
[332:26.36]You're supposed to hit him?
[332:28.55]Dude, my aura just lost.
[332:30.07]No, my aura is massive.
[332:31.77]It would fill up this whole room with light.
[332:35.24]You definitely have aura, I'm pretty sure.
[332:39.32]Do you think I have aura?
[332:44.89]Yeah.
[332:45.75]Oh, yeah.
[332:46.31]Thanks.
[332:47.13]Oh, I needed to hear that.
[332:48.40]I genuinely believe it.
[332:49.42]Yeah, I think we both have aura.
[332:50.92]Both of us.
[332:52.67]Don't listen to your chat or my chat.
[332:54.68]We, for sure, have aura.
[332:55.74]Alright, is there any of these that you want to do one more time?
[333:00.43]Um... Because I'm probably going to... I'm hungry.
[333:05.75]Yeah, me too.
[333:06.03]We've been going for about five and a half, six hours.
[333:08.80]Yeah, let's do... Which one was your favorite?
[333:12.48]Which one did you give a 10 out of 10?
[333:14.53]Tennis was pretty great.
[333:16.29]Yeah, let's do tennis.
[333:17.75]This is for all the marbles.
[333:19.35]Best of three.
[333:19.97]Finale.
[333:21.36]Loser has to... Oh, have a Luigi stuffed character?
[333:30.03]You changed it.
[333:32.83]It's cool.
[333:33.67]I have stuff.
[333:34.47]I have plushies too.
[333:36.70]I used to have a bunch of Mario memorabilia too.
[333:42.34]Like a Reddit shelf.
[333:44.01]I love that.
[333:46.22]Yeah.
[333:46.74]Speaking my language.
[333:47.18]There's nothing wrong with that.
[333:49.26]Alright.

[334:49.31]I wonder what the lore is behind this game.
[334:53.25]Like, why are there ghosts?
[334:56.36]Because... I'd rather just do singles.
[335:00.15]Wait, was it doubles?
[335:01.73]Was it doubles in the Wii one?
[335:04.15]Yeah.
[335:05.43]It was default doubles.
[335:07.16]That was a good hit.

[341:49.87]That wasn't so bad.
[341:50.85]Yeah, I think that's the common thing, because you can't be going into a store and be like, hey, do you have any stuffed animals?
[341:57.64]Actually, you can.
[341:59.44]I take it back.
[342:00.08]I think that's normal.
[342:01.10]It feels fine to say, now that I think about it.
[342:04.10]Hey, where are your squishy toys?
[342:08.01]Hey, give me all your squishies.
[342:09.99]Ew.
[342:11.25]Yeah, I don't like that one.
[342:12.13]Yuck.
[342:12.87]Yuck.
[342:13.35]There's definitely a lot of wrong answers.
[342:15.98]Can I have all your squishies today?
[342:19.79]Here to pick them up in mass.
[342:21.73]So yeah, we got through three of 15 Switch games that we have.
[342:29.11]Yeah, I'm going to have to definitely get an SD card for my Switch because, yeah, I'm out of space.
[342:38.28]But yeah, we got excited to download all the games, but we'll have to do it another time.
[342:42.56]No, that was a lot of fun.
[342:43.48]It was obviously good hanging out with you, dude.
[342:47.43]Yeah, likewise.
[342:48.13]It was a blast.
[342:49.35]Thanks for playing.
[342:50.19]That was Squeaks, everybody.
[342:51.23]Squeaks is a very funny dude.
[342:52.63]He's really cool, and you should follow him.
[342:54.81]Please follow Squeaks.
[342:55.66]He's cool.
[342:56.90]Cool dude.
[342:59.06]And that was Jerma.
[343:00.72]Jerma rules and follow Jerma.
[343:03.83]Smile.
[343:04.71]And you can cheer on Squeaks at the upcoming House Flipper Invitational on May 17th.
[343:11.64]Yes, I'm so excited.
[343:13.22]I had so much fun.
[343:14.88]I heard there's like a co-op.
[343:17.23]It's going to be co-op 2v2 in real time this time.
[343:21.41]So that should be really fun.
[343:23.53]Yeah, it'll be super fun.
[343:25.65]Yeah, I'm excited.
[343:26.67]Yeah, well, not three months.
[343:28.28]We'll do another Switch Monday.
[343:31.90]Switch Monday?
[343:32.84]Switch Monday and then maybe Nintendo Wii one of these days.
[343:37.63]I'm down.
[343:38.83]I think it'd be great.
[343:39.61]Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[343:41.49]Alrighty.
[343:43.06]Thanks for playing.
[343:44.72]You too.
[343:45.58]Goodbye.
[343:48.74]Quicks is hilarious.
[343:50.59]Glad we got to play something together.
[343:52.98]But yeah, that's going to be it.
[343:55.20]I will see you guys probably for Oblivion.
[343:58.66]Probably in a few days.
[344:00.84]I'd say probably Thursday.
[344:05.99]We'll do maybe Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[344:07.91]Maybe we'll do two or three days in a row of Oblivion.
[344:09.55]Because I want to play it.
[344:10.29]I actually want to play it.
[344:11.85]Put some time into it.
[344:19.66]But yeah, that is it.
[344:23.52]We were so convinced that we were going to get through some of these, but okay.
[344:28.18]This one, for instance, you knew we were going to play at least 20 minutes into each one of these.
[344:34.77]So each one of these has 10 games in it.
[344:38.22]I love that 51 game.
[344:41.08]I want to, I just play some more of that by myself.
[344:47.31]Don't be surprised if you see that just pop up.
[344:49.13]That's really fun.
[344:54.92]Thanks to the subs, obviously.
[344:58.09]Appreciate it.
[345:00.73]Oblivion?
[345:01.09]Oblivion's going to be Thursday.
[345:03.05]I might start kind of early, too.
[345:05.90]You don't be surprised if you see that stream start earlier.
[345:09.12]Probably around like 11 or 12.
[345:12.23]Like noon-ish.
[345:18.21]Hey, fix your noise gate compressor.
[345:20.56]Was it still a problem today?
[345:21.76]Well, I mean, I was standing kind of far away from the mic for half of that, so.
[345:28.66]It still was?
[345:29.46]I still got cut off?
[345:32.24]I thought I turned it off.
[345:35.51]It ruined your toad impression.
[345:37.05]I literally turned it off.
[345:38.57]It shouldn't even be on.
[345:44.76]That's weird.
[345:46.82]Well, I'll try to get it fixed.
[345:48.18]The toad scream got cut off.
[345:55.59]Get your skinny ass some food.
[345:59.10]Dude, I've gained like 15 pounds in the last two months.
[346:05.69]I've put on weight.
[346:07.13]And that's a good thing because actually I was starting to lose it six months ago.
[346:13.37]I'm like 153.
[346:13.87]I was like 140, 135 or something back when I was pretty sick six months ago.
[346:21.04]It was not good.
[346:30.23]We're going to do some bush light for the Oblivion streams.
[346:32.50]Um.
[346:36.12]Probably not.
[346:37.72]I think the bush light nights are going to be situated for mainly kind of hanging out at night.
[346:45.63]Drinking and playing scary games.
[346:48.31]Like once or twice a month.
[346:50.14]Maybe like once a month.
[346:55.52]But I don't know.
[346:56.28]We'll see.
[347:01.84]Alright, take it easy.
[347:03.60]Take care of yourselves.
[347:04.34]Call your mother.
[347:04.82]You know the deal.
[347:06.93]See you soon.
[347:07.39]Thanks again if you're here from Squeaks' channel.
[347:09.61]Is Squeaks gonna still stream?
[347:11.03]Is he still going?
[347:12.20]Or is he ending too?
[347:14.94]I will raid Squeaks if he is still going.
[347:19.57]He ended, okay.
[347:21.55]Well, yeah.
[347:22.81]Take care.
[347:23.31]See you soon.
[347:24.53]See you probably on Thursday.
[347:28.54]Bye-bye.
[347:52.16]you
