[00:08.40]I feel like our team's gonna lose, so I'm just gonna spend all my time coming after you.
[00:12.90]That's okay.
[00:13.28]Oh, I can see you.
[00:15.50]I just saw you.
[00:16.08]I don't see you.
[00:18.34]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:20.34]Jerma here with a Tribes Ascend gameplay commentary, and this is going to be a live commentary.
[00:27.64]This was taken from Starz livestream last night.
[00:31.49]We did this at like, god, maybe 3 or 4 in the morning is when this all actually ended.
[00:37.25]So, went pretty late, it was very fun, and I wanted to cut up the last...
[00:41.75]Maybe 15-20 minutes of the stream and that is what you're watching right now.
[00:46.50]And again playing with Star.
[00:49.63]His link will be in the description, as well as MLC_St3alth.
[00:53.17]But you guys already know Stealth, so I don't have to do an introduction for Stealth.
[00:56.71]You probably know who Star is, too.
[00:57.77]What am I talking about?
[00:58.87]But yeah, they will be in the description.
[01:00.87]Go check them out.
[01:01.53]They're really cool dudes.
[01:02.92]But this video, this is a... Not so much a gameplay video as it is a me running for my life video.
[01:10.36]Because Star is really good at this game, and I'm not so good.
[01:14.06]So...
[01:15.02]It's me pretty much just running away from Star and him trying to melee me to death.
[01:18.71]So it's pretty entertaining.
[01:20.89]But I'll let the live commentary kick in, guys, now.
[01:22.89]So I will see you all next time.
[01:25.53]Take care, everybody.
[01:27.75]You guys want to do the double team?
[01:30.47]I'll just smash you in the face.
[01:32.91]Where are you?
[01:33.77]I gotta shoot you.
[01:37.49]You have a YouTube channel.
[01:45.26]Oh, I keep missing this guy.
[01:48.38]Now he's dead.
[01:49.54]Me too.
[01:49.96]Where are you at, Shazbot?
[01:52.02]Shazbot.
[01:53.58]Shazbot, Shazbot, Shazbot.
[01:57.56]No, I just heard noise.
[01:58.94]That was this guy.
[02:01.88]It was this slippery snake.
[02:06.26]I missed so much with this gun tonight.
[02:07.90]Oh my god.
[02:11.06]I keep getting scared that you are right here somewhere.
[02:14.88]One of these times, I will be.
[02:18.44]This guy is teleporting.
[02:23.03]Fine, go over there.
[02:23.73]I dare you.
[02:23.95]You're going to get hit by that grenade.
[02:26.51]Go over there.
[02:28.23]Where I just threw a grenade.
[02:30.84]There's a lot of over there's.
[02:32.06]I don't know where you guys are going.
[02:34.26]I'm very, very, very confused.
[02:37.74]Undo it.
[02:39.96]Un-unconfuse yourself.
[02:43.31]Whoa, whoa, what was that?
[02:46.35]Die!
[02:47.11]Was that... was it... were you just aiming a sniper rifle at me?
[02:51.05]Ah, get... blue plate mailed, whatever it's called.
[02:53.68]Oh, knife!
[02:58.88]Is this like medieval times?
[03:00.86]Plate mail!
[03:01.68]Plate mail.
[03:02.84]Blue plate special mail.
[03:05.63]It's very special, my blacksmith made it this morning.
[03:12.17]Oh, come on, just... Oh yeah, E-grenade!
[03:20.39]Maybe if I'm, like, really unpredictable, I can't, like, be predicted.
[03:23.92]No, I'm gonna punch you.
[03:25.16]Oh, is that the definition of that?
[03:26.34]I'm over here.
[03:27.68]Maybe if I'm, like, really unpredictable, I can't be predicted.
[03:30.10]Oh, come on!
[03:32.60]Come here!
[03:34.42]No!
[03:34.70]Goddammit!
[03:35.06]Humiliation!
[03:45.48]Oh, you were so lucky that things didn't go my way.
[03:50.12]This guy, you're going to walk right into that man and it's going to be your demise.
[03:56.13]How did that hit me?
[03:56.73]I don't understand.
[03:58.23]So is there an item in this game that when you hit somebody it plays like music?
[04:01.03]What?
[04:03.27]Seriously, I just got hit by a grenade and it was like... I don't think so.
[04:09.93]I promise.
[04:10.41]Maybe that was Skype?
[04:11.39]I don't know.
[04:14.24]No, I refuse.
[04:17.14]No.
[04:18.38]No, this cannot happen again.
[04:19.52]Not a second time.
[04:22.34]Grenade.
[04:25.14]Fine.
[04:26.20]Fine.
[04:27.20]You die a normal death.
[04:29.30]Oh, God.
[04:32.18]Oh, I got an assist.
[04:33.62]I got destroyed.
[04:34.60]I got the assist.
[04:39.08]What do you know?
[04:40.56]Alright, I gotta go to the... There is a blacksmith.
[04:42.10]See, there's the anvil right there.
[04:44.96]I don't see it.
[04:47.12]What's this, like, rhino?
[04:48.24]Oh, it's a tank.
[04:52.50]I thought that was an animal.
[04:57.06]What is this guy doing?
[04:59.52]I want to ride the rhino.
[05:00.38]Come on, it'll be fun.
[05:07.20]How do we get it?
[05:07.74]I want a vehicle.
[05:11.84]Then I'll be the coolest guy in school.
[05:13.70]There's, like, circles on the ground, and when you stand on the thing on the circle... Oh, I just called him out here.
[05:21.06]It says, a vehicle.
[05:22.34]Alright, I'm gonna go look for it right now.
[05:27.15]Hope you weren't lying to me.
[05:30.21]He probably was Shaz, but... I have to kill that guy.
[05:41.27]Oh, no.
[05:42.03]It's MLC.
[05:46.16]How do you pronounce that?
[05:48.26]MLC.
[05:49.38]What are you talking about?
[05:50.85]They're just letters.
[05:52.67]Oh.
[05:54.87]They're just letters.
[05:56.77]No, it's actually milk.
[05:58.67]Milkstone.
[06:01.04]Sherman, why do you have so many people like AFK back here?
[06:04.00]Because this team is fun.
[06:07.90]Oh, I didn't get the kill.
[06:10.86]So, um, where's that Jerma guy?
[06:13.16]I see him.
[06:13.62]He's way on the other side of the map, though.
[06:15.98]He is gonna get punched.
[06:17.78]Wall hacks.
[06:20.00]Let's see where I am.
[06:21.14]Motocrossing for extra points.
[06:23.32]Is that true?
[06:24.10]Alright.
[06:26.36]That's not a thing, is it?
[06:28.60]We're gonna catch you.
[06:32.22]Oh, I got you.
[06:33.16]I got you.
[06:34.40]Oh, your teammate just walked by and was like... He wanted nothing to do with that.
[06:39.10]Yeah, why?
[06:39.66]That was weird.
[06:41.21]Like, oh, you two can have your fun.
[06:42.49]Bye.
[06:42.79]Yeah, you're just punching each other.
[06:46.01]They really need a weapon in this game that's like the sandwich for Heavy, where you can just walk around and everyone will understand you're stupid.
[06:52.88]Wait, what?
[06:54.14]You just walk... Oh, no.
[06:57.70]There he is again.
[07:05.27]I'll shoot it behind me.
[07:06.09]What?
[07:06.43]Different tactic.
[07:07.13]I can't believe I missed.
[07:10.33]Some brute killed me.
[07:12.15]Some brutish guy killed me.
[07:14.67]Oh, hi!
[07:16.52]Okay, so where's the Jerma?
[07:18.20]Where's that guy?
[07:19.24]Here's some more, like, noise grenades.
[07:21.70]Whoa, I just ranked up.
[07:23.01]It's doing good, right?
[07:25.23]No, seriously, listen.
[07:27.29]I'm like, listen, you guys can't even hear it.
[07:28.87]Blue plate special.
[07:30.99]I threw two grenades at you, Jerma.
[07:32.67]See, I'm going to make a video of this, and I'm going to turn that up so everyone can hear it.
[07:37.63]I want people to know that that's music plays.
[07:39.75]It's like elevator music.
[07:41.19]When you do what?
[07:41.85]When I get hit by that noise grenade.
[07:45.55]Impact nitro?
[07:46.61]There it is.
[07:47.86]It's like an ear ringing noise.
[07:49.58]Every time I just...
[07:51.98]Or maybe you're talking about fractals, because that's totally a disco party.
[07:57.06]Fractals.
[07:57.80]Oh, so this one doesn't go to 300.
[07:59.02]It depends on the amount of points there actually are.
[08:02.61]So this one doesn't go to 300.
[08:05.07]Sorry.
[08:05.57]Oh, how many times am I going to have to hit you?
[08:09.69]What is no joy?
[08:11.71]When you killed someone who was on a streak.
[08:13.59]Oh, cool.
[08:14.93]I don't know.
[08:20.16]What?
[08:20.48]Wait, where'd you just go?
[08:22.24]No, I'm not falling for this one.
[08:24.04]Who are you talking to?
[08:25.08]You're a freaking infiltrator.
[08:31.47]Where's your health?
[08:32.87]How'd you get the health back?
[08:33.69]I don't know.
[08:36.53]I'm running.
[08:37.05]I'm getting out of here.
[08:38.12]I'm going down the slide.
[08:39.84]You're a juggernaut.
[08:40.42]You can't run.
[08:42.92]Over here.
[08:44.62]Get away from me.
[08:45.72]Get away from me.
[08:48.58]Grenades!
[08:52.02]I'm coming in from the top.
[08:53.13]Oh my god, I got skinned.
[08:54.41]What?
[08:56.15]It said I suicided.
[08:57.29]After all that.
[09:00.87]Hold on, did I throw the grenade at you and then walk over on my own grenade?
[09:03.81]I think that's really what happened.
[09:05.63]Oh, what a smart person I am.
[09:10.01]Hey!
[09:11.19]We did it!
[09:11.62]Hey, good game.
[09:15.26]Shazbot, everyone.
[09:18.22]Oh, it's 12 and 14.
[09:19.52]My goodness.
[09:20.90]Oh, and 18 and 11.
[09:24.28]Unlock's available.
[09:25.24]What am I unlocking?
[09:30.06]Ooh.
[09:32.78]Should I unlock the Doombringer or the Infiltrator?
[09:38.62]You should get a weapon for a class you already have.
[09:42.58]Oh, but it's so... Don't get Doombringer.
[09:45.18]Don't do it.
[09:45.50]Oh, okay.
[09:46.70]Fine.
[09:47.74]Unless you like standing around doing nothing.
[09:51.34]Well, I am pretty much a slug in this game, so... You should probably go Doombringer then.
[09:57.14]You get like a minigun.
