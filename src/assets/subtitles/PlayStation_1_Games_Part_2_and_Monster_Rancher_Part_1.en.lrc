[00:44.93]Hello!
[00:45.37]Hi.
[00:48.67]Give me one second.
[00:50.69]I've got to... I've got to move something, because it's in the way, and I don't like where it is.
[00:58.08]So, un momento.
[01:29.95]Let me just make a tweet and grab a drink and we'll get started here very shortly.
[01:35.42]Hold on to your seats.
[03:35.23]Alright.
[03:37.77]Attention!
[03:39.03]Attention!
[03:41.83]Here's the plan for the next couple days.
[03:45.19]So what we're gonna do is we're gonna play some more PlayStation 1.
[03:47.65]Let's see, let's count them.
[03:53.06]No, I'm gonna count them.
[03:54.70]You guys don't count them, I'm gonna count.
[03:56.02]Ready?
[04:00.14]We got like five other PlayStation 1 games to play.
[04:03.93]These ones are the cream of the crop.
[04:07.18]Don't be fooled by thinking that these aren't the best games that we have for PlayStation 1.
[04:13.47]Except for this one, except for this one.
[04:16.43]Like, the thing that you look at on the screen, this is not one of those.
[04:20.97]You're gonna get one of those probably pretty soon.
[04:23.73]Not right now, though.
[04:26.48]Uh, this is, uh... PlayStation 1, and then maybe, it depends on how long we go tonight.
[04:34.90]It depends on how long it takes to get through some of these.
[04:37.63]We might save the best for last, which would be tomorrow.
[04:42.29]So we're gonna play UFC, the ultimate, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship video game.
[04:49.79]Load the system data, that's fine.
[04:54.91]I've absolutely no idea.
[04:55.97]This is gonna be old characters that you, old UFC characters.
[05:00.98]I guess I'm calling them characters.
[05:02.00]I should be calling them athletes.
[05:04.96]They're athletes, right?
[05:08.64]One free block, would you like to create it?
[05:10.00]Sure.
[05:12.60]Okay versus no.
[05:13.56]Why wouldn't it be yes?
[05:18.33]Why is the okay spread out so much?
[05:23.81]That looks like that O face.
[05:27.23]Here we go.
[05:27.69]Do we get to create our own fighter?
[05:29.85]I hope so.
[05:32.30]Alright, create fighter.
[05:34.04]In this mode, you can create your own fighter.
[05:35.84]Also, you can edit the abilities of non-champion-graded fighters with the points that you have earned.
[05:40.26]Okay.
[05:42.82]Then we have to make our own person first.
[05:45.94]O-W-O-K.
[05:49.52]Welcome to the stream!
[05:50.28]Let's get started!
[05:51.04]Okay!
[05:56.35]Was that the old Ultimate Fighting Championship logo?
[06:00.59]There's a huge, giant guy.
[06:02.05]Like, that's a gold's gym.
[06:03.72]Alright, create a new fighter.
[06:04.66]Alright, wrestling, boxing, strength.
[06:10.86]How do we, uh... Alright, we need a name.
[06:16.07]Uh, I gotta have a good name here.
[06:17.37]This is the first name.
[06:18.15]I was gonna say Albert Einstein, but that's not funny.
[06:24.34]Uh...
[06:28.36]Let's just be like Prince.
[06:30.16]Let's only have a first name.
[06:35.31]How scrumptious.
[06:40.37]That's it.
[06:44.59]How do you spell... How do you spell... It's scrumptious, right?
[06:50.94]It's scrum... Hold on.
[06:53.26]Go back, back, back, back, back.
[06:54.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:56.14]How do I go back?
[06:58.07]Scracious.
[06:59.61]Scrum... Scrum?
[07:02.59]Scrumptious.
[07:03.51]I don't think it's going to be fit.
[07:11.90]Yeah, we're going to have to do scrumptious.
[07:19.28]Oh, you...
[07:22.73]Yeah, we're going to fix this.
[07:25.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:26.54]Don't end this mode.
[07:28.34]Just go back.
[07:32.44]How does it... C-H-U-S.
[07:36.84]That works.
[07:37.56]Scrumptious.
[07:39.66]I'm done.
[07:39.96]And put your full name.
[07:45.86]Okay.
[07:46.80]Scrumptious?
[07:49.82]Last name.
[07:50.30]Alright.
[07:50.82]Last name.
[07:56.45]I don't want it to be numbers.
[07:57.53]Why do I have to be numbers?
[07:59.76]Alphabet.
[08:00.06]There it is.
[08:02.78]Scrumptious, um... The sound's a bit off.
[08:06.24]It probably is.
[08:10.12]How off is the sound?
[08:11.14]I mean, it's off for me, too, a little.
[08:19.23]I think that's just the game.
[08:21.97]Scrumptious, uh...
[08:26.08]Scrumptious O'Leary.
[08:27.28]There you go.
[08:35.25]That's a pretty good name.
[08:41.61]Alright, there he is.
[08:42.19]Scrumptious O'Leary.
[08:43.29]5'10".
[08:43.45]See, he's going to be 6'2".
[08:48.85]Alright, he can only be 250.
[08:51.02]Alright, his rage is going to be like 100%.
[08:56.74]Alright, 6'2", 250, 40.
[09:02.58]Discipline, wrestling, boxer, doesn't matter.
[09:05.66]Boxing, sumo.
[09:07.28]Is there anything with sumo wrestler?
[09:12.52]Sumo.
[09:13.60]Ancient Japanese sport martial art that is steeped in tradition.
[09:17.98]He's gonna be sumo.
[09:21.02]Yeah, O'Leary.
[09:22.34]That's a real Japanese name.
[09:23.86]Strength.
[09:25.18]Good wrestling.
[09:27.25]World-class wrestler.
[09:28.49]Enormous power.
[09:33.09]I don't understand.
[09:33.59]What are these thought bubbles?
[09:36.44]Huge for a middleweight.
[09:38.74]Good puncher with long reach.
[09:40.34]Experienced.
[09:43.74]Ground specialist.
[09:44.74]A lot of MMA experience.
[09:46.24]What's 65?
[09:46.48]Let's go all the way back.
[09:48.96]Strong.
[09:51.52]Very effective side choke.
[09:53.96]Powerful knee strikes.
[09:55.04]Wrestling background.
[09:56.96]This is like a personality test.
[09:58.54]Physical strength.
[09:59.52]Strong physical strength.
[10:04.05]And... No, not well-rounded.
[10:09.77]Good punching power.
[10:11.17]Is there another strong, used to be, used to bottom fighting?
[10:16.05]Excellent takedowns.
[10:17.51]Devastating puncher.
[10:19.85]Strong strength.
[10:21.51]Devastating punches.
[10:24.23]His home...
[10:27.87]Utah.
[10:35.72]Alright, that's fine.
[10:36.42]He's from Utah 5.
[10:38.26]Country... UA... USA.
[10:41.52]Egypt.
[10:44.42]No, he's from... He's from fucking Utah 5, Sweden.
[10:51.42]Oh, I think I broke the game.
[10:52.91]No, there we go.
[10:53.53]Abilities.
[10:56.86]Yeah, he has to have 100 power.
[10:58.86]Speed.
[11:00.80]Endurance, I'd say probably 100.
[11:03.78]Stamina, 100.
[11:06.06]Octagon control.
[11:06.88]I don't know about that.
[11:07.78]Ground skill.
[11:10.23]His speed doesn't matter.
[11:11.07]He's a sumo wrestler, for God's sake.
[11:16.08]They're like 10.
[11:17.05]Because I do want to make sure he has enough octagon control here.
[11:21.39]Life, power, speed, endurance.
[11:23.15]That's all we need.
[11:26.27]Okay.
[11:27.05]How do I make the guy?
[11:30.18]Oh.
[11:33.98]It's just Twitch emotes.
[11:37.42]Every PlayStation 1 game just has Twitch emotes for all the characters.
[11:40.20]I like this one.
[11:43.09]That looks like our guy.
[11:45.05]He's got the hair.
[11:46.29]He's got the glued down hair.
[11:49.59]Or this one.
[11:53.94]It's definitely this one.
[11:56.26]Clothing.
[12:02.34]Such customization options.
[12:04.86]He's gonna have the lightning pants.
[12:08.40]And way too much.
[12:09.26]He's gonna have a foot diaper and a knee diaper.
[12:11.73]That sounds good to me.
[12:14.07]This is for Player 2.
[12:14.79]Doesn't matter.
[12:17.57]There's gonna be... There is no Player 2.
[12:22.34]Jesus Christ, okay.
[12:24.92]Save this character, yes.
[12:32.03]Now it's time to play the game.
[12:34.19]I can't wait to do... I'm glad we killed like 10 minutes there.
[12:37.51]Because we're gonna play this for like 5 minutes.
[12:48.32]Looks like he got hit in the face with a shovel.
[12:50.44]Why am I creating new data?
[12:56.25]What?
[13:01.85]Was that to create fighters?
[13:03.59]Save system data, sure.
[13:06.26]They needed a save system for every possible scenario.
[13:09.56]With an old memory card here.
[13:11.89]I forget these days.
[13:14.19]Checking memory card.
[13:15.51]Overwrite data.
[13:16.61]Sure.
[13:17.35]Why am I in an overwrite data loop?
[13:19.93]Don't power the console up.
[13:21.13]Complete.
[13:23.91]Wow.
[13:27.28]That was intense.
[13:28.24]Alright, let's go with... Let's just do an exhibition.
[13:32.84]I need to figure... UFC tournament...
[13:37.37]You can select from any of the real UFC fighters or UFC fighters that you've created.
[13:40.07]What about Road to the Championship?
[13:45.44]Oh god, wait, no, I have to actually win.
[13:46.98]Alright, let's do UFC Tournament.
[13:56.95]Uh, no, I don't know any of these people.
[14:01.69]Oh, you gotta remember guys, pick your fighter!
[14:05.84]Matt Hughes, Eugene Jackson, Chuck Liddell, Evan Tanner, Scrumptious O'Leary.
[14:16.48]Yes, I want to be Scrumptious O'Leary.
[14:21.00]Look, that guy's doing the Donkey Kong pound.
[14:22.54]So who are we going at?
[14:23.68]Who's fighting first?
[14:25.42]Frank Shamrock, Ken Shamrock's little brother.
[14:29.11]You can tell this is old because he looks like he's like 22.
[14:35.29]First start.
[14:37.51]So how do we play this game?
[14:42.27]Age 40, 6'2", 250, Utah, Sweden.
[14:46.23]These are all wrong.
[14:47.53]This is just somebody mashed on the randomize button, and they didn't care what they got.
[14:51.91]Alright, let's go, Scrumptious.
[14:59.39]Beat his face in.
[15:02.95]Entrance music?
[15:06.71]No, it's just a Casio keyboard rendition of the actual UFC zone.
[15:17.53]What are these camera angles?
[15:25.90]Oh boy.
[15:26.56]Alright, that's all you get.
[15:30.96]Everyone has the same entrance.
[15:36.62]I want to skip this, it's the same thing.
[15:45.92]It's the symphony of fucking geese.
[15:49.62]Here it comes.
[15:56.00]Crave Entertainment presents the finest mixed martial artists in the world who will compete here tonight in the world's ultimate proving ground, the Octagon.
[16:05.37]Crave Entertainment.
[16:06.55]What else?
[16:11.27]And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to begin the ultimate... That's not what he says.
[16:22.46]Fighting Championship!
[16:30.95]Let's begin UFC!
[16:35.05]This is back when UFC only probably had 10 people in the crowd.
[16:39.59]This is 1997.
[16:40.39]Beginning with a fighter standing to my left.
[16:50.39]He is a submission fighter.
[16:53.21]Standing 5 feet 10 inches tall.
[16:55.44]And weighing in at 192 pounds.
[16:59.60]He's not that heavy.
[17:02.62]What's he going to say about me?
[17:04.96]From Utah 5, Sweden.
[17:13.24]I'm going to lap my ass off.
[17:14.22]He's going to go.
[17:15.44]And in this corner.
[17:16.24]Player one.
[17:18.58]That's what they used to do.
[17:36.90]Got it!
[17:39.50]He said it!
[17:41.92]He said, that's me!
[17:42.70]I'm player one!
[17:43.71]It's me!
[17:45.23]And when the action begins, our third man in the octagon is our referee... Wait, the referee's the guy in the middle with his saw?
[17:54.07]Is that guy gonna get up halfway through and be like... playing tapes for us?
[18:02.06]Here we go.
[18:02.88]Scrumptious.
[18:03.24]I don't know how to play.
[18:03.78]Are you ready?
[18:05.18]Are you ready?
[18:06.70]Well, let's get it on!
[18:07.88]Here we go.
[18:08.24]Alright, go!
[18:09.04]Take them to school!
[18:12.60]I don't know how to play.
[18:16.54]Remember, I'm a strong fighter.
[18:19.01]How do you get- how do you get a guy- Oh, he's- The match is over.
[18:27.15]He just shattered my fucking arm in half.
[18:29.25]That's the fastest- What a waste of a $120 pay-per-view that was.
[18:40.28]That's the only replay they can show.
[18:41.94]That's the only thing that happens.
[18:47.55]Hey, show me some more replays.
[18:50.40]Why?
[18:50.88]My guy has like a hundred health and a hundred endurance.
[19:03.18]No, restart.
[19:04.97]Let's go.
[19:05.39]Remember, guys, there were no tutorials back in like 1996.
[19:11.33]I don't know what to do.
[19:15.83]I don't have the game manual.
[19:17.19]How about this game used?
[19:21.41]I got this in a little bit of bubble wrap and a jewel case.
[19:25.36]This didn't have anything else.
[19:26.40]Maybe we're gonna do this again.
[19:38.14]The tutorial is the menu.
[19:39.38]Actually, I could probably get started.
[19:48.18]I have to at least get a few punches in.
[19:55.02]The tale of the tape.
[19:59.41]Use the internet to find out?
[20:00.75]I mean, I guess I could, but do we really want to sit here and learn how to play UFC?
[20:05.99]Maybe I do.
[20:06.57]Let's see if there's a move list.
[20:09.41]Okay, here we go.
[20:15.46]Somebody just screamed.
[20:16.28]Oh, there's no move list.
[20:22.57]holy that's an overhead smash is that me saying that am I saying go no no don't get on the ground this happened last time get him off you get him off you get him off you what the why is he instantly tap out to everything that guy didn't even do a move he just put his hands on my head
[20:53.80]I tapped out before he even started to do a move.
[20:59.64]This guy sucks.
[21:03.24]Alright, hold on.
[21:03.78]How do you... Let me see.
[21:04.98]UFC PlayStation 1 controls.
[21:10.14]Um... No.
[21:18.58]There ain't, no, there ain't nothing here.
[21:21.04]UFC, original UFC game.
[21:23.41]Original UFC game.
[21:26.43]Controls?
[21:28.33]No, all they have is for the new ones.
[21:31.09]I have to win a fight.
[21:32.57]I'm not moving on.
[21:33.25]We're not playing another game.
[21:34.23]I'm not doing a goddamn thing until I win.
[21:37.02]That's for damn sure.
[21:39.20]Damn sure.
[21:42.30]I have to beat one person before we do anything else for the rest of the evening.
[21:49.16]What happened to the chat?
[21:49.96]Oh, there it is.
[21:53.30]Let's just go.
[22:00.69]Maybe I should edit my character.
[22:01.95]I don't know how I would even do that though.
[22:06.91]Don't ask me.
[22:07.69]Alright, let's go.
[22:13.92]There's gotta be like a grapple system maybe.
[22:28.13]Skip everything again.
[22:29.83]Let's go.
[22:30.41]I'm not wasting fucking time.
[22:32.91]We're gonna beat this.
[22:42.83]And by the way, this is not even fair.
[22:45.32]I'm in a different weight class than this guy.
[22:50.66]Just keep mashing and I'll be fine.
[22:51.88]You think so?
[22:52.26]I mean, this is back in the day.
[22:53.92]You do probably have something there.
[22:57.07]Alright, let's go.
[22:57.63]Come on.
[22:58.27]Let me get this going here.
[22:59.17]Let me just, like... Oh, already on the ground.
[23:03.84]I didn't even do... Why?
[23:15.02]Why?
[23:16.20]I can't do anything.
[23:19.98]Oh, goddammit.
[23:28.11]I actually really don't want to sit here all night.
[23:34.83]Take him to school!
[23:40.86]I don't know what to do.
[23:42.84]I'm gonna try.
[23:43.44]Maybe a different character?
[23:44.68]Is Scrumptious O'Leary that terrible?
[23:56.09]Change his stats to make him... I mean, he's got pretty good stats.
[24:07.13]The octagon control... Alright, if I lose again, we're gonna go back and we're gonna make octagon control and speed higher.
[24:13.73]Is it because he's 40?
[24:17.37]It actually might be because he's 40 years old and he just can't handle it anymore.
[24:24.81]I just gotta get into this.
[24:26.49]Here we go.
[24:29.47]I didn't even have an opportunity!
[24:31.85]Get up, please!
[24:49.50]Unbelievable.
[24:50.34]Okay, we're gonna try to edit his stats and see.
[24:52.90]I'm gonna make him like 22.
[24:58.74]That's so stupid.
[25:01.87]Is there a train?
[25:03.39]Is there a train?
[25:07.41]What?
[25:07.63]I'm gonna be a different person.
[25:11.77]I'm gonna be Chuck Liddell.
[25:12.71]He's the best.
[25:13.15]Isn't he like the best guy that ever lived or something?
[25:18.81]I'm fairly certain that Chuck Liddell is the... He was probably on the cover of this game when it came out.
[25:28.33]Chuck Liddell is like 50 now.
[25:30.21]That's how I can tell.
[25:41.29]Here we go.
[25:42.21]Chuck Liddell.
[25:45.18]It's time.
[25:46.56]Make it happen.
[25:48.64]Are you ready?
[25:52.10]No!
[25:52.66]This is Chuck Liddell.
[25:53.50]He's like the best in the world.
[25:56.56]You're not going to do it to Chuck Liddell.
[25:58.00]He is by far the strongest, the best.
[25:59.90]He was on the cover of the game.
[26:00.87]He was on the cover.
[26:01.33]Ladies and gentlemen.
[26:23.16]Oh, that was fun.
[26:24.66]That was fun.
[26:25.76]We're gonna move on now.
[26:29.49]It's just me?
[26:31.29]What do you mean it's just me?
[26:33.07]What am I supposed to do?
[26:39.09]Am I hitting a button to tap out?
[26:40.93]No way.
[26:46.13]Let me go back.
[26:46.91]How do I get back to the menu?
[26:49.85]How do I escape?
[26:50.77]Yeah, return to the main menu.
[26:56.47]How much did this game cost?
[26:57.97]I don't know, probably like $6.
[27:01.24]Here we go.
[27:01.86]Options.
[27:02.54]Take John's training!
[27:06.90]There we go.
[27:07.42]Don't even need a manual.
[27:15.45]I'm ready.
[27:16.55]Sumo.
[27:18.55]John McCarthy.
[27:21.51]Let's make the difficulty really fucking easy so we can know what's going on.
[27:28.20]See?
[27:29.14]John McCarthy's 40.
[27:30.02]This is the same character.
[27:32.96]Look, he's from a made-up place too.
[27:34.58]Stevenson Ranch, all one word.
[27:37.10]He did the same thing I did.
[27:38.26]Alright, so how do I play the game?
[27:54.03]Even the training!
[27:54.97]You don't even let me train!
[27:56.17]Stop it!
[27:57.45]Oh my god!
[27:58.91]He just grabbed me by my head!
[28:01.15]Okay, man.
[28:14.50]Wait a second.
[28:21.72]Okay, run forward, run backwards.
[28:23.96]Backward step grab is those two together.
[28:27.56]Jump grab.
[28:29.34]So it's two, you'd have to hit two buttons at the same time.
[28:32.36]Grab is those two.
[28:34.97]Jump grab choke hold.
[28:38.07]Low air, so it's all just a combination of either square and triangle.
[28:42.35]Straight upper.
[28:45.39]Alright, what is tap out?
[28:48.66]What is get up?
[28:50.18]Escape short upper.
[28:55.05]Okay, this is standing.
[28:57.07]How do I go to the next command?
[28:59.19]Here we go.
[28:59.55]Okay.
[29:00.35]Upper mount position.
[29:02.68]Under mount position.
[29:03.68]Struggle escape is left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.
[29:08.32]Okay, so you have to go like... Alright, I think I get it.
[29:14.36]Escape is those two.
[29:16.00]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[29:20.83]Let's go.
[29:30.94]I'm never gonna... I'm never gonna... I think I did it.
[29:37.90]I got up.
[29:39.56]You have to do it insanely fast.
[29:50.48]Let me try to get a grab in.
[29:52.34]No!
[29:52.68]God damn it!
[29:59.10]Get off it!
[29:59.50]Get off!
[30:14.47]We're going to play the next game.
[30:19.65]Let's move on to the next one.
[30:25.39]What the fuck am I supposed to do about that?
[30:29.16]I was going so fast.
[30:30.24]Alright, this next one.
[30:32.26]This is also a fighting game, but this one's a little different.
[30:36.88]I feel like we might be on this one for a long time.
[30:40.31]I did a little bit of research on this, and this could turn out to be one of the greatest games that anyone has ever played, and I'm not kidding.
[30:47.53]That's not a joke.
[30:48.75]I'm dead serious.
[30:51.79]This could, after tonight, make it to my top 10 best video games ever made.
[30:57.15]Let's see if it ends up being real.
[31:02.49]This one is called Fighter Maker.
[31:05.71]You make your own fighter and you can make any move.
[31:10.72]You do your own animations.
[31:13.12]We're going to be on this for probably a pretty long time.
[31:30.33]This could turn out to be one of the best.
[31:34.94]This is from Age Tech.
[31:38.17]Fighter Maker.
[31:38.95]Copyright 1998.
[31:45.27]Normal mode versus mode option edit mode.
[31:50.25]We're going to have to go to edit mode first probably.
[31:57.54]Alright.
[31:58.50]So.
[32:01.20]I have no idea what's going on.
[32:03.04]We're going to just do new.
[32:05.07]All stored data will be lost.
[32:06.34]Yes.
[32:07.14]Yes.
[32:08.40]Yes.
[32:09.92]I guess this already is new.
[32:11.04]Profile.
[32:15.90]Uh... This is just making the sounds as if this was a xylophone.
[32:25.16]Uh, name... We're not gonna... There'll be a new name here.
[32:32.85]Um...
[32:36.09]Scrumptious.
[32:36.57]No, this is not Scrumptious.
[32:37.73]Scrumptious sucks.
[32:38.63]And that is a cursed name for the rest of the time that I ever own this console.
[32:43.01]No.
[32:43.97]I'm not making old leader again.
[32:47.69]How about, uh... I was about to just type in Scrumptious.
[32:50.75]I don't even... Can I go back?
[32:54.09]Yes.
[32:54.65]Okay.
[32:58.33]How about, like... We gotta have something like... Like, hey, how about this one?
[33:03.78]The Predator.
[33:09.58]Predator.
[33:11.88]No.
[33:14.94]The Predator.
[33:15.56]I don't even know what the fuck.
[33:19.48]Jex.
[33:20.93]You want me to make Jex?
[33:25.53]Fine.
[33:27.01]We'll make Jex.
[33:31.11]Jex is good.
[33:31.95]I like that for now.
[33:32.61]Hometown.
[33:34.64]Hometown.
[33:37.46]hometown's gonna be a little Utah birthday must harvest moon menu why am I doing random numbers this is like not even real how about like how about like seven seven twenty seven nineteen nineteen uh
[34:09.72]1977.
[34:09.74]727, lucky seventh, right?
[34:11.86]Can I do 77?
[34:14.98]No, there are only... Oh, well, God, this is the other way around.
[34:20.08]Okay, 777.
[34:24.62]I like it.
[34:28.11]That sounds good.
[34:28.77]He's, uh... Alright, you can do, like, you don't know.
[34:32.81]I mean...
[34:36.21]Is male the house or is male the key?
[34:44.37]Is stick figure woman or is house tree?
[34:48.45]Earth with a house growing out of it.
[34:49.81]Earth with a tree growing out of it, I believe, is male.
[34:52.95]Blood type?
[34:53.49]Who cares?
[34:56.29]Hobbies.
[35:02.25]I got a hobby for you.
[35:05.84]Enforcement.
[35:14.47]None of this matters anyways.
[35:15.59]His hobbies are include enforcement.
[35:20.94]His occupation, here it is.
[35:24.27]He's an officer.
[35:33.00]Fighting style, this is where it gets important.
[35:35.14]Okay, don't matter.
[35:35.80]Law... How is law abiding?
[35:46.89]He's a law abiding citizen.
[35:56.20]Crater.
[35:57.08]Me.
[36:02.43]Sounds good.
[36:05.09]Alright, that's good.
[36:05.77]Save it.
[36:06.27]Alright.
[36:08.85]Slot 1.
[36:09.19]New file.
[36:17.78]Alright, so now that's saved.
[36:22.48]Body.
[36:28.36]I think we just have to pick a template for this guy.
[36:30.88]I like that already.
[36:33.77]No, that's not this.
[36:34.83]Not this.
[36:35.39]Not this lady.
[36:37.57]No, I think it's gonna have to be the skeleton guy.
[36:45.34]No, there's even more.
[36:47.26]Please tell me there's a guy in like a police officer's uniform.
[36:49.68]Ah, there we go.
[36:50.28]That's pretty good, Jex.
[36:52.94]Yeah, absolutely.
[36:54.22]There's Jex.
[36:58.50]Did we switch games?
[36:59.76]Motion.
[37:03.01]Okay, let's go with hit.
[37:03.81]Let's go with new hit.
[37:06.85]The stored motion data will be lost.
[37:08.52]Yes, that's fine.
[37:12.00]Hit one.
[37:12.46]Let's edit hit number one.
[37:17.93]So motion.
[37:32.55]Let's do a little quick math here.
[37:37.01]What the fuck does any of this mean?
[37:40.05]Let's go with body, height, hip.
[37:44.04]Right hand.
[37:44.46]Okay.
[37:59.12]I'm moving him around out of his template.
[38:03.81]I think these are the different frames.
[38:15.08]Insert.
[38:15.74]Yeah, I think, hold on a minute.
[38:16.64]I think I'm figuring this out.
[38:20.78]Insert.
[38:22.28]There's another piece of frame data.
[38:23.72]Okay.
[38:27.47]So now this should...
[38:34.97]There it is.
[38:35.41]Okay, there's our first animation.
[38:40.41]Config?
[38:48.29]This is gonna get real fucking weird.
[38:52.49]Okay, that's hit one.
[38:54.46]We're fig- we're getting- so these are- this is frame- each individual frame.
[38:59.98]So what we have to figure out now is...
[39:03.20]How to get him to do anything with his hands.
[39:06.12]Because I think this is body, right?
[39:08.99]Store the changes there.
[39:09.71]Let me go back and look.
[39:16.19]There's so many here.
[39:16.87]Alright.
[39:17.73]So hit.
[39:18.27]Let's go to hit one.
[39:20.37]Edit that again.
[39:22.25]So there's a keyframes.
[39:25.51]So you go from here to here.
[39:28.69]So when he comes back from here back to here, this should be a punch.
[39:35.67]So what, how, what is right hand?
[39:45.13]How do I get, how do I grab his hand?
[39:49.67]Body, fixed point, there we go, wrist, okay.
[39:55.23]This one.
[40:00.06]What the hell, what the hell is he doing?
[40:02.58]He's giving the middle finger now.
[40:05.79]Fixed point.
[40:07.29]Hand, left hand.
[40:08.45]Adjust.
[40:17.08]Hmm.
[40:19.86]Okay, hand L. Okay, hold on.
[40:30.19]So, okay, I'm figuring it out.
[40:34.85]We got this frame here now.
[40:39.90]Let's check it out now.
[40:43.02]Got it!
[40:44.78]Got it!
[40:45.12]We have to go in and actually move the anchor point.
[40:48.94]So that's a punch.
[40:50.42]We just figured out how to do one left punch.
[40:55.28]Is there a preview?
[41:01.77]Nice!
[41:05.74]So far so good.
[41:07.16]He's a coffin man.
[41:13.37]So right here is when the hand comes up.
[41:16.57]I feel like we need to have the elbow bend a little bit right now.
[41:22.79]So this is where I want the fixed point to be the... Let's do the other hand.
[41:29.78]We'll call this one the Frankenstein.
[41:32.90]So now I got his hand selected.
[41:34.12]Adjust.
[41:38.93]Oh, whoops.
[41:39.73]Okay, wrist.
[41:42.39]Now... Right here.
[41:44.80]Okay.
[41:48.78]Shoulder, elbow.
[41:49.54]This comes up a little bit like this.
[41:54.28]Okay, let's see what it looks like now.
[42:11.58]That's a fake out.
[42:12.29]He's faking out a little bit.
[42:17.79]Oh, I could spend all day on this.
[42:21.03]You guys have no idea.
[42:23.45]I could sit here all night and do this shit.
[42:27.42]We need to move his legs.
[42:30.12]We need to insert.
[42:32.26]Uh, let's... From here, let's insert.
[42:34.94]No, I'm gonna go back on insert.
[42:41.34]Let's get a keyframe in here.
[42:42.44]So it goes from here to here.
[42:43.24]So now we can go to edit.
[42:51.07]New Jerma Rumble game.
[42:52.09]We're just gonna sit here for like two hours and make this guy.
[42:59.19]So knee, the knee has to be bent.
[43:02.87]Okay, the other knee.
[43:14.57]We have to bring him down to the actual ground.
[43:23.64]Back it up.
[43:24.40]Pull him down.
[43:29.87]That's good.
[43:30.81]We can add some frames here.
[43:32.89]He needs to come down.
[43:40.97]Down, down, down.
[43:41.87]How do I bring him down?
[43:44.93]Come down!
[43:47.93]No, no, why is the camera zooming in?
[43:49.27]I don't want to rotate him, I want him to be down here.
[43:52.91]This is one attack.
[44:03.16]Yeah!
[44:04.58]That's the jumping punch!
[44:10.13]We need to move his body.
[44:16.76]Why did the PS1 have so many engines?
[44:18.52]Yeah, that's true.
[44:20.96]He needs to be... His arms, he's a little too stiff.
[44:23.99]Let's get into here and actually edit this.
[44:29.81]I want it to be loose!
[44:33.95]We got like shoulders, right?
[44:35.87]Hips?
[44:36.41]Okay, let's like... Let's make him a little fucking loose, you know what I mean?
[44:41.85]Oh my god, I could do like a backflip kick!
[44:43.73]I could do a triple backflip kick!
[44:46.94]Welcome to the stream, guys!
[44:53.25]This is gonna be what we're doing for a little while.
[45:02.51]I could spin them around a hundred times.
[45:03.72]Uh, I'm gonna need to adjust.
[45:14.80]No, that's okay.
[45:16.54]Alright, let's start over.
[45:17.50]I want to do like a grab move now.
[45:19.12]I mean, unfortunately... This is one of those games where I would put like 100 hours in off stream just to make a fighter.
[45:32.28]I would spend like 200 hours playing this game to like make one stream.
[45:38.17]In fact, I might just do that.
[45:43.03]I think this is going to be an entire stream on its own.
[45:49.68]Because like, I don't know how many people want to sit here and watch me do this for like five hours.
[45:53.63]Because this could be fucking crazy.
[46:02.15]Let's see, I want to see what's possible.
[46:03.51]Alright, throw.
[46:08.44]Throw one.
[46:15.56]This is gonna be insane.
[46:18.01]Just grab somebody and, like, whip them.
[46:22.85]So let's see.
[46:23.37]Edit.
[46:23.63]Let's see what you can do with this.
[46:24.85]So this is a throw.
[46:37.76]My hand tilting around.
[46:38.86]Yep.
[46:44.62]Come all the way around.
[46:45.62]Alright, let's put them both up here.
[46:56.65]His head doesn't move.
[46:57.61]I'm sure, I think I can move his head.
[46:58.99]That's a pretty good time to throw.
[47:07.02]What about head?
[47:09.84]No, there's no, there is no head, it seems.
[47:12.32]Hip, bass?
[47:15.21]I can tilt him.
[47:15.91]Let's see what that looks like.
[47:26.93]Wait, is he grabbing onto the guy?
[47:30.09]There's all the frame data too.
[47:34.33]There's a lot here.
[47:37.43]There's so much for me to learn on this game.
[47:43.33]This could be so fucking funny if I actually sit here and do this, but I think- I don't think I'm gonna do it on stream.
[47:51.25]This is a scenario where I'm gonna like just do this like for a week straight and give you guys like the most- the stupidest fucking stream you've ever seen.
[47:59.37]Cause then it'll be like a surprise for you guys, it won't just be this for four hours.
[48:08.78]Yeah, look at the shit you can do here if I spent actual time on this rather than just on stream.
[48:16.14]You can remove people's heads.
[48:25.91]I wish I could see a better angle of this.
[48:32.41]I wanna like... Okay.
[48:38.16]You can put it to... You actually set what you want it to be.
[48:44.64]How much damage it does, where it hits.
[48:48.74]He just whips his head around.
[48:55.93]I want to see like a wild character that has like one frame.
[49:01.07]There's so much you could do with this.
[49:04.25]But I feel like that's a boring stream.
[49:07.38]And there's a lot of other things to do.
[49:09.39]Like, there's a lot of things I want to do tonight.
[49:12.13]Yeah, I'm putting this in the back.
[49:14.45]I'm putting this in the closet.
[49:16.50]It's going in the pocket.
[49:17.82]And I'm going to put a bunch of time into this.
[49:20.54]Because I want to be able to turn this on and have like five characters created.
[49:26.65]Because it's going to take a ton of time and troubleshooting and me not knowing where I'm going.
[49:32.13]I want to learn the menus.
[49:33.31]I want to figure it all out.
[49:34.95]This is not going to be like an entertaining stream if I do that.
[49:40.60]So you'll see this again real soon.
[49:43.34]And it'll be, there'll be like 10 created characters.
[49:45.62]And then we're going to do like a whole thing.
[49:47.67]It's going to be a PlayStation 1 nightmare rumble.
[49:53.33]So, off stream, I'll take care of it.
[49:55.71]A literal year later.
[49:57.07]No, we ain't gonna do that.
[49:59.91]I need, I, I, I am excited to do this though.
[50:02.02]Alright, so here we go, the Fighter Maker.
[50:05.74]Get ready, get ready for that stream in like three weeks.
[50:11.02]Oh, sorry, blue screen.
[50:16.51]Now let's move on to, let's move on to what you came here for, right?
[50:23.43]Because I've got quite a few things I want to do with this game.
[50:26.69]This is one of my favorite PlayStation 1 games.
[50:32.14]It's a surprise.
[50:33.80]What do you mean?
[50:34.32]It tells you exactly how it is.
[50:36.36]That's not true.
[50:36.96]For all you know, a guy can do three somersaults and do like a roundhouse kick.
[50:44.13]Well, now I just told you what it was.
[50:45.91]We're going to play Monster Rancher.
[50:49.53]The original Monster Rancher.
[50:53.26]This is a... This game... This might turn out to be one of, like, a terrible game, but I remember this being one of my total, total favorite games for the PlayStation 1.
[51:11.92]This is a game about fighting monsters, and you get DNA out of CDs and shit.
[51:15.28]Don't worry.
[51:15.64]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[51:17.46]Here it comes.
[51:18.10]Monster Rancher.
[51:24.25]If you don't know the gimmick of this, I won't spoil it yet.
[51:28.33]But there is a pretty large gimmick.
[51:35.67]It is said that the disk stamp, one almost implied to scribble.
[51:39.50]It is said that one monster is trapped inside each disk.
[51:45.76]The ancient remains.
[51:46.64]Mm-hmm.
[51:54.42]You pull monsters from disk DNA.
[51:56.22]It could be any disk you have in your house.
[51:57.45]There's the gimmick.
[52:01.39]Look, it's real!
[52:06.93]The monster's temple.
[52:10.58]See?
[52:10.94]He's got a coin in his hands.
[52:11.90]He brings it in the temple and that's how you can pull DNA out.
[52:19.42]You get random monsters based on what you put in.
[52:24.23]I'm a father.
[52:24.83]You train them and you fight with them.
[52:29.71]That's really funny.
[52:33.82]There was a show about this?
[52:36.82]And then you fight with them.
[52:38.14]So you understand the basic premise, it's Pokémon, but with an incredibly easy to exploit gimmick.
[52:52.48]He just does his fog puke, it's fine.
[52:55.38]I hope he plays Digimon, why would I play Digimon?
[53:04.70]Now here comes the actual opening cutscene.
[53:12.64]There's a typical- I can't read this.
[53:15.64]Can anybody else read that?
[53:22.45]And I'm ready.
[53:26.02]This should be illegal.
[53:27.66]Why?
[53:32.28]You know you can read discs to make monsters?
[53:34.06]Oh, that's the whole point of the game.
[53:36.56]I'm ready for this.
[53:40.59]New game.
[53:44.79]So, you can use any disk that's ever been made.
[53:51.67]Get a little intro here.
[53:52.47]Hello, I need you to sign here, please.
[53:57.70]Quick!
[53:57.94]No, not JD.
[54:00.98]We're gonna be just me.
[54:02.60]I don't want to be another person.
[54:03.68]This is me.
[54:06.04]This is Jeremy.
[54:06.72]Nobody else.
[54:07.28]There you are, Jeremy.
[54:08.61]See you later!
[54:19.46]Jeremy from FIMBA, congratulations, this is to certify you as a monster breeder.
[54:22.97]Please visit FIMBA first week of April.
[54:29.09]This is not a visual novel.
[54:33.43]You're here to register, aren't you?
[54:36.22]Please wait here.
[54:39.70]Hello, Jeremy.
[54:41.34]Congratulations on acting, acing the breeders exam.
[54:46.82]Good luck.
[54:48.27]You'll be given an assistant.
[54:50.04]Do you know what assistants do?
[54:52.48]No.
[54:53.52]They're trained to help you breed your monster and all other fable regulations.
[54:59.71]Once you get your assistant, you can't make a change.
[55:04.25]Got it.
[55:05.63]Yeah.
[55:06.75]Well then, now I'll introduce you to your new assistant.
[55:11.44]Go get her, please.
[55:15.33]Jeremy, this is your assistant, Holly.
[55:20.98]How do you do?
[55:21.48]My name is Holly.
[55:23.84]I have just completed my training to become your assistant.
[55:28.66]But, don't worry, I'm well trained and familiar with the basics of reading.
[55:35.29]Trust me, please.
[55:38.47]You'll have to excuse her boldness.
[55:41.07]Well, go to town and get your first monster together.
[55:50.73]Let's go.
[55:53.55]Breed!
[55:53.95]Monsters!
[55:54.31]Breed!
[55:54.61]Monsters!
[55:54.97]Look who's here!
[55:55.51]Oh, Holly, how have you been?
[56:01.55]I've been great.
[56:03.25]I've just been assigned to Jeremy.
[56:06.10]Where are you now?
[56:08.10]Jeremy, this is my training teacher.
[56:11.28]He has won the four major tournaments many times.
[56:15.55]win all of the official tournaments.
[56:18.01]Yes, and you can enter the four major ones too.
[56:21.81]So, Tesca is great.
[56:24.59]That was long ago.
[56:25.97]I'm retired now.
[56:27.92]By the way, Jeremy, did you get your monster yet?
[56:32.30]Not yet.
[56:33.66]Your first monster is special.
[56:36.12]Choose wisely.
[56:37.98]You can get additional unique monsters from your CDs and learn a lot.
[56:43.87]Good luck, you two.
[56:46.05]Thank you.
[56:47.77]Ed, remember to take good care of your monster.
[56:51.36]Yes, Master.
[56:54.26]Bye!
[56:57.30]We must try and be as good as he was.
[57:06.87]Nice weather!
[57:08.07]I'm glad to be assisting a nice person like you.
[57:11.43]I was a little worried.
[57:13.62]It is really a pleasure to meet you, Jeremy.
[57:17.46]First, let's get you a monster.
[57:20.71]If you want a basic type, go to the market.
[57:24.15]If you want a monster from CD, go to the shrine.
[57:28.55]Ask me anything.
[57:29.73]Press the O button.
[57:33.10]Let's go.
[57:33.84]Okay, so... Here's the deal.
[57:38.82]What I've decided to do with this is we're gonna, any CD, any DVD, I went through my collection.
[57:45.88]And I made sure to get quite a few of the video captures on.
[57:51.08]Can you see me?
[57:51.76]No, you can't.
[57:52.62]I want you guys to be able to see this shit.
[58:00.87]You know what I mean?
[58:02.99]Yeah, I know.
[58:03.63]Look, I got out of the shower and I didn't comb my hair.
[58:06.83]Get over it.
[58:09.07]So anyways.
[58:11.03]I have a... The game is loud?
[58:22.29]Why is it this loud?
[58:23.27]Let's move this in the corner over here, so we can actually get a good view of everything.
[58:29.95]I actually think I'm gonna move this... Can I move this over here?
[58:39.37]Alright, so what I have here is I have my collection of CDs and DVDs.
[58:44.84]Let me get it.
[58:47.90]First of all, these down here are my favorite movies ever made.
[58:55.62]This is the only... These are like the only dozen movies that anyone should ever own.
[58:59.87]And we're going to use them for the specific purpose of breeding monsters.
[59:03.47]I've never owned any other movies in my life.
[59:06.42]So I decided to get the whole collection here and let's go.
[59:09.56]So let me like... I don't want you to see them before it goes in.
[59:13.54]As we listen to the fucking Tiny Toons music.
[59:20.83]So let's start off.
[59:21.75]I'm gonna move these down for a second here.
[59:26.95]There's so many.
[59:27.65]Alright, let's go to the... First of all, let's go to the shrine so we can start this.
[59:35.24]In this shrine, you'll be able to generate a monster from any CD that you may have.
[59:39.12]Would you like to try?
[59:40.83]Yes.
[59:42.21]It's random.
[59:44.01]This is where you actually start to make monsters in this game.
[59:47.63]So again, we're going to use... We need good quality DNA.
[59:50.14]We need high quality DNA.
[59:52.36]And it's going to start with Meet the Fockers.
[59:55.25]That's a classic Ben Stiller movie.
[59:57.91]It's probably his best movie.
[60:00.01]What's her name?
[60:00.87]She's also an actress.
[60:03.27]Barbra Streisand's in it.
[60:05.07]Robert De Niro's in it.
[60:05.85]He's a pretty good actress.
[60:07.61]Meet the Fockers.
[60:08.23]Let's see what we get from this.
[60:12.81]Again, Monster Rancher is out.
[60:15.06]Monster Rancher's out of the case right now.
[60:16.54]It's not in the PlayStation.
[60:17.60]In goes Meet the Fockers.
[60:20.70]Movie number one.
[60:22.76]Let's see what we get.
[60:27.97]And then press X. Here it comes.
[60:33.44]Here we go.
[60:42.41]See the end.
[61:06.55]DVD is not a CD.
[61:07.79]What are you talking about?
[61:13.58]DVD is a CD.
[61:16.08]And see, look.
[61:22.03]Come on.
[61:22.39]Meet the Fockers doesn't have a date on it.
[61:26.93]Of course it does.
[61:34.67]Here we go!
[61:35.21]Here's the big moment!
[61:36.03]We got a big moment here!
[61:36.99]Meet the Fockers!
[61:37.69]Come on!
[61:44.94]Hey!
[61:45.12]What are we gonna get?
[61:54.76]It's the cat from the first one!
[61:55.98]It's the cat from Meet the Fockers 1!
[62:04.20]Rover Tiger Sub Hare.
[62:14.07]Wow!
[62:14.63]What a monster!
[62:15.57]Good luck raising him!
[62:18.73]That's a good looking monster.
[62:19.69]You have to give him a name.
[62:20.59]What'll it be?
[62:21.03]What's the cat's name from Meet the Fockers?
[62:26.41]I'm gonna call it Urn Cat.
[62:33.28]Urn Cat.
[62:39.59]That's good, alright.
[62:43.33]No, it's not going to be Garfield, it's going to be Earncat.
[62:46.81]You take him in, let's make another monster.
[62:52.59]Can't even fucking read DVDs.
[62:54.63]But can you read Elvis?
[62:56.45]You absolutely can.
[62:58.45]I want to do another one.
[62:59.59]You already have a monster.
[63:00.75]Good luck.
[63:02.12]No, fuck, I don't want the Meet the Fuckers one that I did.
[63:04.44]I want the Elvis one.
[63:05.48]I have a ton of CDs here.
[63:08.20]Alright, let's go.
[63:08.96]Save it.
[63:14.09]We're gonna have to wait.
[63:22.67]Freeze.
[63:24.39]Card one.
[63:25.38]Save it.
[63:33.18]Freeze him.
[63:34.84]What can I do for you?
[63:35.88]I'd like... No, you can't.
[63:36.86]I want you to freeze this guy.
[63:40.12]No, no, no.
[63:40.52]Come on.
[63:40.80]Give me, give me... No.
[63:43.09]Lab.
[63:43.95]Freeze.
[63:47.15]Freeze this one.
[63:49.27]Alright, let's see what we get from Elvis.
[63:53.61]Burn a CD of you screaming.
[63:55.84]Alright, let's go to the lab.
[64:02.96]Let's make another monster.
[64:04.04]No, I don't want to combine a monster.
[64:06.26]I want to go to the shrine.
[64:10.83]Can you please go back?
[64:15.33]There we go.
[64:15.81]Alright, shrine.
[64:16.63]Let's see what we get here.
[64:18.93]Here we go.
[64:19.51]Here comes Elvis.
[64:21.60]Let's try it.
[64:25.66]Insert the CD.
[64:27.44]Monster Ranch is coming out.
[64:31.32]I have all these goddamn DVDs, man.
[64:36.37]Read it.
[64:42.56]Reading the data from Elvis' greatest hits.
[64:50.28]Here we go.
[64:56.63]I'm really excited to see what comes from Elvis Presley.
[65:01.47]That's a fucking classic CD.
[65:03.07]What am I doing?
[65:04.25]I like this CD.
[65:07.92]He's got good songs on here.
[65:12.75]Let's see what we get.
[65:16.15]Five hours of inserting CDs.
[65:17.81]Like, the next one that was coming up was click.
[65:19.91]Alright, now we're not doing it.
[65:24.53]There's like 15 DVDs here that I can't read.
[65:29.12]Ooh.
[65:31.66]That one looks pretty good.
[65:32.50]That's Elv!
[65:35.76]Look, he's like shaking the hips around like Elvis.
[65:38.38]He's the prince of all music.
[65:44.47]I actually kind of like this one.
[65:48.73]Click has a funny fart scene.
[65:55.10]Name it Elvis.
[65:55.80]Yeah, it's gonna be Bunny.
[65:56.96]It's gonna be Elvis.
[66:02.22]Like, these are all my movies.
[66:04.22]And, like, apparently it can't read DVDs.
[66:06.67]It has trouble reading them.
[66:11.67]Maybe I should just do four DVDs at a time and see what happens.
[66:15.32]I'm gonna freeze this one.
[66:17.34]Let's do one more.
[66:18.20]I'm gonna do like a quadruple movie.
[66:19.74]We'll see what we get.
[66:21.72]Freeze it.
[66:24.03]Freeze this one.
[66:24.59]That one's pretty good.
[66:25.27]Alright, so let's go with, uh... Let's see what, like, what do we got here for a movie?
[66:32.35]These are like my top four favorite movies of all time.
[66:36.42]Let's see.
[66:40.29]These are the only DVDs that I own.
[66:41.89]These are the only DVDs that I physically own.
[66:43.87]Uh, we're gonna go with Click.
[66:46.89]And then we're gonna do The Departed.
[66:49.85]And then we're gonna wrap it up with Big Mama's House.
[66:53.52]I mean, like, these are the only DVDs that I own.
[66:58.44]Trying.
[67:02.00]Yes, I would like to try.
[67:03.34]These are all classic fucking movies.
[67:14.01]Get it in there.
[67:15.47]This is click going in first.
[67:17.51]Can you read it?
[67:21.23]It's trying.
[67:22.39]I can hear it.
[67:27.74]Click ain't working.
[67:28.80]Let's just try Big Mama's house.
[67:32.00]Click didn't work.
[67:36.16]One of these has special features.
[67:37.54]One of them might have a soundtrack.
[67:43.35]It's reading it.
[67:44.95]I heard the beep.
[67:49.25]Alright, we'll wrap this one up with, I guess, VeggieTales.
[67:55.29]VeggieTales Easter special, maybe that'll work.
[67:57.89]We're gonna get like a fucked up demon.
[68:02.75]Let's see if it works.
[68:08.23]Splice all the DNA of the monster.
[68:16.93]It read it.
[68:17.43]I heard it.
[68:17.79]VeggieTales.
[68:22.40]That will wrap it up with Celine Dion's greatest hits.
[68:25.86]All from the Titanic.
[68:27.34]All of her songs are from the Titanic.
[68:32.52]What kind of fucked up monster?
[68:33.72]It read all four of these.
[68:44.74]Okay.
[68:45.74]It's taking a long time.
[68:47.15]Alright, what are we going to get?
[68:51.41]Good.
[68:51.69]So this monster was a combination of Click, Celine Dion, Big Mama's House, and The Departed, right?
[69:01.02]Oh, my fucking CD tray won't close.
[69:04.06]Oh, shit.
[69:05.28]There we go.
[69:09.54]Oh, and VeggieTales.
[69:10.20]Yeah, VeggieTales is in there too.
[69:11.28]Let's see what it is.
[69:21.23]What DNA did it pull out?
[69:22.97]It's gonna be the strongest monster ever, because those are the top four greatest movies of all time.
[69:27.43]What is it?
[69:32.32]It's a perfume?
[69:36.10]What the fuck is that?
[69:40.48]Icy gel.
[69:44.62]Alright.
[69:47.46]That's a pretty good monster.
[69:48.52]Look at that!
[69:50.27]It's got the girth of Big Mama.
[69:52.45]It's got the supple elegance of Celine Dion.
[69:56.90]It's blue like click.
[69:59.16]It's green.
[69:59.66]There's a vegetable in there.
[70:00.60]There's a fucking pickle in there for the heart.
[70:05.40]We have a great fucking monster here.
[70:06.96]I'm keeping this one.
[70:18.59]I'm gonna call you, uh... We gotta, this is the one I'm gonna use.
[70:22.43]We're using this one for a little while.
[70:25.70]Uh, let's see, how about... Yeah, the iceberg from the Titanic?
[70:31.66]Come on, how do you not see all this?
[70:33.86]It's all painted there.
[70:37.12]Um... Pickle, we're not doing Pickle Rick.
[70:39.66]Get out of here.
[70:40.37]Come on, what do you think this is?
[70:41.59]Fucking fourth grade?
[70:42.91]It's not gonna be Greg.
[70:50.51]Yeah, but... Let's give it a fucking cool name.
[70:54.25]Like... Project... Project Screecher.
[70:59.91]Let's just put all their movie names together.
[71:01.69]Okay, we got Celine.
[71:03.39]That's C-E.
[71:05.95]C... Celine Mama... C-C-Mom... C-Mom... C-Mama... Veggie... C-Mom... C-Momito...
[71:20.28]Simomitil, uh... Lick.
[71:25.28]Simomitil... Simomit... Simomitilick.
[71:31.18]Simomitilick!
[71:32.96]Seam and deem... Whoa, I just said it!
[71:38.91]How about this... No, no, it's not gonna be C. It is gonna be C. It's just C. Alright, save!
[71:48.97]It's just C.
[71:56.41]Let's go train him.
[72:01.72]See mama to lick.
[72:05.36]Uh, combine- combine with Elvis.
[72:08.08]Oh, my fucking head hurts.
[72:17.27]Should I combine him with Elvis?
[72:18.41]Uh, hold on.
[72:20.51]Wait, wait.
[72:21.09]Go to the lab.
[72:22.51]Alright, combine... You can't as long as you have one on the ranch.
[72:27.06]Who's on the ranch right now?
[72:28.62]Are you going to take C to the ranch?
[72:30.14]I mean, this is a lot of discs.
[72:35.78]You can put any PlayStation 1 game in there.
[72:37.64]I just want to get through my DVD collection.
[72:44.74]So this is where you train the monster.
[72:47.68]Which item do you want to give him this month?
[72:53.62]Potato, fish, or meat?
[72:56.43]Animal feed that monsters dislike.
[72:58.19]Drops loyalty.
[72:59.15]We don't want to do that.
[73:00.65]An appropriate snack for your monster.
[73:02.01]The ocean overflows with this fish.
[73:04.31]Or a feast for a special occasion.
[73:06.73]That's brand new.
[73:08.10]It's our first time we've brought the monster back here.
[73:10.82]We're going to give meat.
[73:13.10]Sea is very well.
[73:14.28]Are you sure?
[73:21.31]Does not... Looks very unwell, actually.
[73:31.28]Alright, so we got data, we got schedule.
[73:34.56]Work, let's do training.
[73:36.48]Let's train C. Excuse me.
[73:41.71]May I help you?
[73:42.93]Can I get some info on the training courses?
[73:45.81]Well, may I have your name and the breeder's name as well, please?
[73:49.51]My name is Holly.
[73:50.45]The breeder's name is Jeremy.
[73:52.84]This is your first visit here, huh?
[73:55.21]We provide training service for a fee.
[73:57.19]Training is four weeks.
[73:58.41]Your monster is away for that time.
[74:00.65]For safety, he trains only on appropriate courses.
[74:05.13]Any questions?
[74:06.49]No, I don't think so.
[74:07.85]Please select one.
[74:08.61]Alright, so we can do... This one gives... Ravage... Power Ravage.
[74:17.49]More life.
[74:20.31]Spot Ravage gives you plus to skill or plus to intelligence.
[74:26.34]I would say this creature is probably lacking in intelligence.
[74:28.82]Because we did just put in... Like 3 out of 4 of those movies were like 19% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[74:36.78]So we should probably get some more intelligence on here.
[74:45.89]He ran away.
[74:46.57]No he didn't, he's right there.
[74:51.29]He's freaking out.
[74:53.26]We combined too many things.
[74:55.72]His DNA is all fucked up.
[75:01.14]Fatigue.
[75:02.10]Alright, let's do it.
[75:03.78]Intimidation and more intelligence.
[75:08.26]It costs two thousand dollars.
[75:09.88]Sure.
[75:10.28]See you in four weeks from dreams.
[75:17.59]Oh, he looks so happy!
[75:21.01]Oh, he failed.
[75:22.85]He got the results of the first week's training.
[75:26.41]Come on, you can do it!
[75:28.17]Be the inflatable pool tube that you wish you were.
[75:30.97]Ten up, intelligence.
[75:34.05]Keep going!
[75:36.36]Keep going!
[75:38.50]Come on!
[75:40.28]Use that perseverance from the departed!
[75:43.26]Use your godly powers from VeggieTales to persevere through this training!
[75:49.51]3 out of 4, that ain't bad.
[75:50.95]What did I tell you?
[75:51.47]3 out of 4 Rotten Tomatoes scores were over fucking 80%.
[75:55.49]See, he's back from training, but he wasn't successful.
[76:00.36]How?
[76:02.56]See, he's sorry.
[76:06.96]He just like fucking farted.
[76:08.96]He did a frontwards fart.
[76:14.27]What item do you want to give him?
[76:15.65]I don't have any more money.
[76:20.69]You're running out of cash.
[76:21.82]Work or compete or you'll go broke.
[76:25.40]See, he's very tired.
[76:27.96]No, no, just rest.
[76:29.18]Rest for like... Rest this week.
[76:38.99]No, he's fine.
[76:40.64]C is well.
[76:43.60]Loyalty 7.
[76:44.18]Alright, let's get, let's get, let's do some... Let's do the battle.
[76:47.54]Where's the next battle?
[76:48.36]Right here?
[76:49.32]Spring E cup.
[76:50.16]Level E. Entries.
[76:52.24]Four monsters.
[76:53.22]Purse 1000 gold.
[76:57.10]C has a little loyalty now and may act confused.
[77:02.50]Alright, we'll do the next one.
[77:03.26]We'll go for D. Spring D. No, I need to do this.
[77:07.18]I get a CD fragment if I do this.
[77:16.86]See, it looks on well.
[77:19.16]Let's do it.
[77:20.40]Watch your monster's will during battle.
[77:22.52]Monster needs will to act.
[77:24.76]Don't get KO'd with low will.
[77:33.07]This is an E cup.
[77:38.07]This shouldn't be too difficult.
[77:40.27]Ladies and centelmen, we will now begin the battle.
[77:45.95]We got C versus Rager.
[77:51.59]Opponent.
[77:52.05]Hit opponent is... The higher C's will is, the better his hit percentage and damage will be.
[77:58.35]So conserve C's will.
[78:00.78]Hit method.
[78:02.08]The distance between C and your opponent will decide what acts you can do.
[78:05.10]Press X to perform.
[78:06.48]Use left, right, up, down directional button on the controller to change moves and actions.
[78:11.17]Move method.
[78:12.77]Move monster with the R1 and L1 buttons.
[78:15.21]He will not go too close to a wall or an opponent.
[78:18.24]If an opponent gets too close to your monster, back him off by pressing square.
[78:23.32]Okay.
[78:25.50]I think we're ready to do it.
[78:28.24]Battle.
[78:31.49]Instructions.
[78:32.77]Good luck.
[78:38.46]It's time for our first fight.
[78:40.26]We can count on C. Make us proud.
[78:47.49]Make us proud, C. You know you can do it.
[78:51.29]Here he goes.
[78:55.90]Life power.
[78:56.96]Is my microphone wicked fucking loud?
[78:58.84]What is going on here?
[79:00.78]Did my microphone turn the fuck up?
[79:02.22]Like, way up?
[79:03.36]Hello?
[79:04.28]Is that better?
[79:06.99]How loud have I been this whole time?
[79:08.42]That was weird.
[79:13.36]He's actually alright, he's not in a terrible spot.
[79:15.18]Alright, ready.
[79:19.45]I don't know, I got STAB.
[79:23.57]Alright, we got STAB.
[79:24.65]Oh, okay, that was a big, that was a whip.
[79:29.66]Tackle.
[79:32.94]He's just confused.
[79:34.38]Remember that whole thing about Will?
[79:42.45]Whip.
[79:43.31]No.
[79:43.87]He doesn't know what he's doing.
[79:52.64]Nice!
[79:52.94]Good job!
[79:53.36]22 damage.
[79:54.14]That's pretty good.
[79:54.62]Back it up a little bit.
[79:55.70]Get your Will.
[79:59.35]No.
[79:59.59]Wait.
[80:01.57]Back up.
[80:03.93]Don't get in the way.
[80:06.55]Disgusting.
[80:09.57]No.
[80:10.05]Stop getting confused.
[80:10.95]Oh, come on.
[80:12.97]Your will is so high.
[80:13.91]What are you talking about?
[80:16.99]That was a big crit, too.
[80:18.05]Come on.
[80:18.47]Nice dodge.
[80:20.09]Excellent dodge.
[80:22.29]It's alright.
[80:22.61]It's alright.
[80:23.01]Just one more hit.
[80:23.55]It's over.
[80:28.58]He lost.
[80:28.92]C is for Comeback.
[80:36.63]But now I'm quiet?
[80:39.91]Maybe not anymore.
[80:40.91]Who knows?
[80:42.67]I have no idea why it's still doing this.
[80:45.90]I'm as confused as everybody else sitting here right now, why that happened.
[80:49.58]Alright, here's another battle.
[80:51.58]I think he'll be alright this time.
[80:54.88]He's alright.
[80:58.29]It was fine before.
[80:59.08]I don't know.
[80:59.62]I'm an idiot.
[81:01.86]It looked like it was just exploding.
[81:04.46]It was like peaking all over the place.
[81:05.66]Now it's doing it again.
[81:09.26]OBS was telling me it was like in the red.
[81:18.55]So now I'm peaking.
[81:21.07]I don't fucking get it.
[81:23.95]I think my, I honestly, I think my, I think my, uh...
[81:27.85]My box just broke.
[81:30.18]Fucking confused.
[81:32.94]Game down now.
[81:33.42]This guy's so fast.
[81:56.82]I'm gonna back up.
[82:07.76]He wasn't ready for this.
[82:10.08]Am I in the other room?
[82:15.40]Speak up a bit!
[82:17.44]I don't understand what's happening!
[82:25.20]Nobody can hear you.
[82:31.66]I really, I'm not even kidding.
[82:33.46]My Scarlett solo, I think, just fucked up and is not working anymore.
[82:38.73]How's that?
[82:39.87]Testing, testing, testing, testing.
[82:44.89]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[82:48.49]Better?
[82:48.89]Fuck!
[82:56.09]That probably was even fucking louder.
[83:00.25]It's so loud.
[83:01.37]I don't know.
[83:02.39]It's fucking broken.
[83:05.57]Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
[83:06.67]It's all fucked up.
[83:12.94]C wasn't ready for this.
[83:14.56]Now it's loud but bad quality.
[83:17.48]I'm going to switch to my webcam mic in a second.
[83:25.85]Yeah, I was actually going to replace this Scarlet solo.
[83:29.59]Because it sucks.
[83:37.52]Oh, it's definitely not my mic.
[83:41.84]It's the compressor that's plugged into right now.
[83:45.63]It's a piece of junk.
[83:50.49]I might actually win this one.
[83:52.47]I say that now, but I just got crit.
[83:56.49]Stop not knowing what to do!
[83:57.61]Alright, should we drop C in Acid?
[84:08.54]I think it's time to dump C into, like, a vat of Acid.
[84:16.59]C sucks!
[84:19.71]I don't even want this stupid character.
[84:21.59]This is a bunch of bad movies!
[84:24.99]We didn't have the right combination of movies.
[84:28.00]This time we'll get it right.
[84:29.26]I promise.
[84:31.50]Let's put him on ice.
[84:33.40]I wanna make another monster.
[84:39.13]This one I feel like we'll have.
[84:40.13]Oh, absolutely.
[84:43.53]I'm sure of it.
[84:44.27]This one's gonna be good.
[84:47.33]Oh boy, this is gonna be the best monster that we've ever fucking seen.
[84:51.04]Guaranteed.
[84:53.42]Oh, this is going to be fantastic.
[85:00.44]My top three favorite movies ever.
[85:02.86]Sure, encourage them.
[85:04.28]Put them on ice.
[85:04.88]I don't have any money left.
[85:13.40]Combine.
[85:15.12]I did it wrong.
[85:16.06]I'm going to do VeggieTales, then Click, then Elvis.
[85:21.83]Yeah, we're gonna go get the movies CD.
[85:26.81]Lab.
[85:29.55]Freeze them.
[85:31.69]We'll do a couple here.
[85:33.91]Let's do... I'm gonna go get the movies right now.
[85:36.55]Give me one sec.
[85:37.23]It's right here.
[85:48.74]This'll be a home run.
[85:54.14]It turned into a cube.
[85:57.23]Alright, so next on the list to make for a monster is... I love when it does that, it freezes me.
[86:04.91]Okay, next on the list is... Let's go to the shrine.
[86:10.50]I would like to do it.
[86:12.60]First of all, we're going with... Oh boy.
[86:16.76]I'm ready for this.
[86:19.42]Gremlins Special Edition.
[86:21.32]Gremlins 1.
[86:23.75]Gremlins 2, couldn't find it.
[86:33.77]One of the best movies ever made.
[86:36.31]Without a doubt, in my mind.
[86:38.99]Rate it.
[86:39.23]Put that over there.
[86:47.15]Okay.
[86:48.79]Well, it's spinning.
[86:51.50]There's Gremlins.
[86:53.60]Who can forget Rush Hour 3?
[86:56.74]There are two discs for Rush Hour 3.
[86:58.28]We're going to use the first one.
[87:06.09]You got classic Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan comedy.
[87:10.25]I mean, it is one of the best movies that's ever been made.
[87:14.76]Wish that one to be done.
[87:19.44]Spinning?
[87:19.82]Nope.
[87:20.16]Okay.
[87:21.50]Not anymore.
[87:23.86]On the same realm of that, we've got Shanghai Noon.
[87:27.66]Another classic Jackie Chan movie.
[87:31.26]This one looks like it was burnt, so maybe this will work.
[87:43.15]Okay.
[87:45.27]And last but not least, let's clean it up with the movies.
[87:49.23]The movies.
[87:49.59]This is the movies with the expansion pack.
[87:54.65]This will clean us up.
[87:55.61]This will get us completely red.
[87:58.97]Here we go.
[88:11.92]Got it.
[88:16.50]What do we get from this?
[88:19.86]Oh, I am so excited about this.
[88:25.30]Put it back in.
[88:31.42]See what it is?
[88:36.32]I'm actually pretty stoked about this.
[88:38.01]Here's the big moment.
[88:53.86]Is it a horseshoe crab?
[88:56.28]What the fuck is that?
[88:57.28]It's like Frampt from Dark Souls.
[89:04.56]Worm, worm, worm.
[89:10.38]Alright.
[89:11.98]I like this guy.
[89:15.51]Wow, what a monster.
[89:16.95]It's already got a good rating.
[89:20.52]There is type you don't want to slay with.
[89:23.73]There is type you don't want to stay with.
[89:26.61]You have to give him a name.
[89:31.99]I love this guy already.
[89:35.67]Name him... Look at how happy he is.
[89:37.45]He's got like a happy face.
[89:38.49]How about, uh... Shplyso.
[89:43.26]I like Shplyso.
[89:45.90]Like S-C-H.
[89:50.72]Spleisho.
[89:55.69]Is it... Should it be Spleisho or Spleishso?
[89:58.95]Spleisho.
[90:00.21]Spleisho.
[90:01.99]Spleish?
[90:04.45]Yeah, Spleisho.
[90:07.41]Spleisho.
[90:08.17]Spleish... Yeah, Spleisho.
[90:12.93]Alright, will it be Spleisho?
[90:15.08]Yes, it will.
[90:17.16]That's too many consonants, now it's not.
[90:18.72]Alright, now how do I make money?
[90:20.68]Let's take him to the ranch.
[90:27.35]Give him a nice fish dinner and then we're gonna train him.
[90:32.45]The only- the movies I have left are... Alright, I've got The Dark Knight.
[90:40.92]And then another Adam Sandler movie, The Cobbler.
[90:44.49]I found this movie.
[90:45.73]I found it!
[90:47.31]I bought it.
[90:50.47]You're running out of cash.
[90:51.29]Work or computer, you'll go broke.
[90:52.59]Alright, we need to work.
[90:54.55]Alright, Splisho is doing well.
[90:59.51]He's terrifying.
[91:00.31]Why is he terrifying?
[91:01.19]He's a horseshoe crab worm monster.
[91:03.33]Alright, let's feed him.
[91:06.41]I don't have any items.
[91:09.21]What do you mean?
[91:10.43]How do I know how- what?
[91:13.10]Work.
[91:14.40]Alright.
[91:16.34]Let me see the data on him.
[91:18.80]He's got 120 skill.
[91:23.05]He's got 140 life.
[91:24.43]That's pretty good.
[91:25.61]Let me move this.
[91:26.13]Let me get my ugly mug out of the way.
[91:29.79]So he's got mostly power and skill.
[91:31.72]He doesn't have very much speed.
[91:35.07]I guess he's alright across the board.
[91:36.13]Let's make him... What do his moves do?
[91:39.33]Run away, hurt, sick.
[91:41.69]Oh, here we go.
[91:43.07]So this is pierce, pierce, pierce, and bite.
[91:51.18]They're all power moves, it seems.
[91:57.93]So let's do, what, cart?
[92:00.13]This one is 150 gold.
[92:01.61]This is, he drops speed and fatigue.
[92:03.63]I don't know if I want that.
[92:04.31]Let's just do cart.
[92:06.39]You want to try this job.
[92:09.41]Look at how cute that is.
[92:12.46]That's so adorable.
[92:14.80]He didn't do it right.
[92:16.44]No, don't punish him.
[92:17.32]He's a good boy.
[92:20.86]He seems to be relieved.
[92:23.60]He's doing well.
[92:24.78]Um...
[92:27.38]I should train him then.
[92:33.60]Please select one.
[92:34.74]Alright, let's do... Maybe skill.
[92:39.89]Or, yeah, skill.
[92:43.21]It'll cost 2,000.
[92:44.27]Gee, I don't have that money.
[92:46.93]Have I already blown it?
[92:49.72]He has to work.
[92:50.28]Alright, do card again.
[92:55.86]I know you can do it.
[92:58.24]Go on.
[93:01.22]He's got it.
[93:02.06]Nice.
[93:02.28]There you go.
[93:02.72]Good job.
[93:05.23]Obtained 100 gold.
[93:06.05]Do it again.
[93:09.67]Here comes the first week.
[93:11.71]Which item do you want to give him this month?
[93:13.09]Appropriate snack.
[93:16.56]Let's give him the fish.
[93:17.26]We can't afford it.
[93:18.42]We can't give him the meat.
[93:21.12]An official tournament comes up at the end of this month.
[93:23.54]Check upon Splishio.
[93:26.98]Uh, Splatio seems to be doing well.
[93:31.18]Alright, schedule.
[93:34.94]Work again.
[93:35.46]These ones cost more.
[93:40.76]Just keep doing cart.
[93:47.95]See, he's fine.
[93:51.37]Make him be the mailman?
[93:52.37]Oh, that's gonna be so funny.
[93:55.48]He's tired.
[93:56.56]No, schedule him for sleep.
[93:59.42]Rest.
[94:00.16]Do you want him to rest?
[94:01.22]Yes.
[94:01.46]Aww.
[94:03.40]Alright, do you guys want- I like the idea of me burning a CD of me screaming.
[94:14.64]I'm gonna burn a CD of me speaking in tongues and see what happens.
[94:21.42]We'll do that later.
[94:26.51]Burn like a CD of me saying like a prayer to get a good monster.
[94:32.03]Alright, schedule it again.
[94:33.09]Work.
[94:35.59]This one, let's do a little bit of speed.
[94:39.44]This one is forest.
[94:44.18]He got it.
[94:45.72]One more?
[94:46.06]Yeah.
[94:50.32]Burn rat movie.
[94:53.36]Official tournament this week.
[94:55.92]I don't think I can do it.
[94:57.12]He's not ready.
[95:00.18]I don't think he's ready.
[95:05.22]Battle... No, he's not ready for this.
[95:13.41]He's not ready.
[95:16.63]Mailman.
[95:17.69]Fine.
[95:18.15]He can be the mailman.
[95:22.67]Girl Scout cookies.
[95:32.83]He seems to be very relieved.
[95:38.21]Which item do you want to give him this month?
[95:41.79]It's all about keeping him happy.
[95:43.03]Alright, let's have him rest.
[95:53.00]He is doing his best.
[96:00.48]Insert the Monster Rancher CD when it asks for one.
[96:06.14]I think that actually happened, the first monster we made.
[96:08.48]16 loyalty, he's getting happier.
[96:10.21]I don't even know if I have a CD burner.
[96:16.73]Do we have any CDs I can put in here?
[96:21.67]Let's train.
[96:26.81]Do I have enough money to do any of this?
[96:28.53]I definitely don't.
[96:30.71]We're gonna have him work.
[96:32.91]Uh, build, mine.
[96:34.15]Okay, circus.
[96:35.11]Come on, that's so cute.
[96:37.51]Join the circus.
[96:42.41]Look at him, he's like a baby seal!
[96:45.23]More power, more speed, more intelligence, and money.
[96:50.23]Excuse me.
[96:52.64]Let's do it again.
[96:53.36]Work.
[96:54.64]Uh, this is... He has to get Mailman, right?
[96:59.40]Mailman.
[97:02.28]He's got it.
[97:03.70]No!
[97:05.95]Ugh.
[97:12.51]He's okay.
[97:13.07]Uh-oh.
[97:17.91]He's very tired.
[97:18.81]He can schedule some rest.
[97:26.11]I'm training the wrong stats.
[97:27.91]I should be training power.
[97:33.52]Give him fish.
[97:36.36]Let's take a look.
[97:38.22]He wants power.
[97:43.52]View.
[97:43.96]There he is.
[97:46.98]We need things that increase power and probably speed.
[97:50.74]Power and defense, maybe.
[97:57.03]Power and speed.
[97:58.37]Because he is really slow.
[98:02.74]What else can I get?
[98:03.30]Power, life, minus speed, and plus fatigue.
[98:08.42]Life, defense, intelligence, skill.
[98:10.54]We need... Alright, well, this one's increasing defense.
[98:16.32]Power and life.
[98:18.13]I want to see them.
[98:18.91]He has to complete them all at least once.
[98:20.25]Let's do card again.
[98:31.26]I wonder what the percentage is for him to actually get this to work.
[98:36.00]Burn a CD of Harvest?
[98:37.70]Harvester?
[98:42.63]Why would he try to fix the bad stats instead of just going whole hog into the good stats?
[98:48.91]Well, we have to... Style easy.
[98:51.65]What does that mean?
[98:52.29]Does that mean he's just chillin'?
[99:02.46]I really should get a Simpson.
[99:03.72]He needs speed.
[99:05.36]He's so slow.
[99:08.64]Forest.
[99:09.06]It means he's lazy.
[99:13.69]He got it!
[99:17.31]I think I'm spoiling him?
[99:22.52]When is the, uh, battle?
[99:24.20]There's a battle coming up here now.
[99:29.95]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[99:32.13]I don't want him to fight right now.
[99:33.13]Let's have him rest.
[99:40.30]Dex build worm.
[99:45.86]Look, he's like, hey, I'm sure happy.
[99:50.50]Power and... I want a double one.
[99:52.86]Power and life.
[99:54.14]Minus speed, that sucks.
[99:57.40]We'll do life and defense.
[100:00.88]We haven't even seen this one yet.
[100:05.14]He's helping!
[100:07.38]What?
[100:10.10]I'm not punishing him.
[100:11.15]Do it again.
[100:19.97]Why did you say Dex build twice?
[100:21.73]Because I'm a weirdo.
[100:26.43]Alright, official tournament.
[100:30.60]What's going on here?
[100:31.72]You're running out of cash.
[100:32.74]Work?
[100:33.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[100:37.13]We need to get him in that mine.
[100:45.51]Is he getting bigger?
[100:46.17]There he goes.
[100:47.73]Defense up.
[100:51.04]Minus 4 skill.
[100:51.92]At least he has much higher health now.
[100:56.18]Very tired.
[100:57.06]Rest.
[100:59.17]Alright, let's try to get him into a fight here.
[101:00.47]The music's bad?
[101:06.67]What are you... what?
[101:08.06]No, it's not.
[101:08.66]The music's cute.
[101:12.06]He's got a much higher loyalty than the last one.
[101:15.64]Um... I don't have enough money to train.
[101:18.50]Okay, like, one more into power and just let him rest.
[101:30.07]Nice.
[101:32.71]132 power.
[101:34.03]I'm definitely way better than any of these chumps.
[101:39.00]Seems to be in shape now.
[101:39.94]He should make a good showing.
[101:42.54]Seems well.
[101:43.18]Alright.
[101:43.64]Let's do it.
[101:44.98]Battle.
[101:45.72]Right here.
[101:46.56]Level E.
[101:46.90]500 gold to win.
[101:47.54]I mean, you just told me he was ready.
[102:00.05]He's gonna immediately tap up.
[102:02.81]Official e-cup.
[102:09.09]Ladies and gentlemen, they will now begin the battle.
[102:11.83]It's Shplicio versus the monster that's in every video game.
[102:15.47]Let's take a look at the data.
[102:21.04]Your opponent, Barura, has little loyalty and tends to act confused.
[102:29.05]Okay, yeah.
[102:29.89]Yeah, yeah, use left.
[102:30.90]Yeah, I know how to do this.
[102:32.66]I want to see the actual data between us, though.
[102:34.54]Can I see?
[102:35.10]Can I match this up?
[102:35.96]Not yet.
[102:38.74]How do I see the actual data?
[102:41.44]Wait, what's going on?
[102:44.09]I just said I'd... Are we just going?
[102:49.83]I guess we're just going.
[102:51.37]Why did it say I can't wait?
[102:52.29]I'm going to kick this guy's ass.
[102:59.09]That's the Dungeons & Dragons monster.
[103:02.47]Oh, wow.
[103:03.77]Say goodbye to this guy.
[103:05.53]He's got higher skill and speed, but I overpowered him and everything else.
[103:09.19]Except he's good in everything else.
[103:11.11]I'm going to lose.
[103:12.98]I'm ready.
[103:19.32]Wow.
[103:21.44]Wow.
[103:23.10]Holy shit.
[103:24.12]That was... You're talking about almost instantly winning this.
[103:28.91]He has no idea what he's even doing.
[103:35.17]Kill it!
[103:39.19]Not ready my ass.
[103:45.86]He's so good.
[103:49.96]Come on!
[103:51.63]Hit him!
[103:54.05]There's a victory right there.
[104:00.72]Splicio is, by far, one of the best.
[104:04.46]Alright, Splicio.
[104:09.54]Give Splicio instructions.
[104:12.91]Against, this is a green dog.
[104:14.21]We're going against a broccoli dog.
[104:16.83]I'm not sure if he's ready.
[104:25.12]Well, that's like a broccoli rhinoceros.
[104:30.05]I didn't check the data on this one.
[104:32.39]Okay, let's see.
[104:33.61]105.
[104:34.76]Oh, wow.
[104:35.40]How did you get to the second round, dude?
[104:43.26]How the fuck did you get to the second round?
[104:49.61]That's a double tap.
[104:50.61]That's a triple tap.
[104:56.77]I didn't even know I had that move.
[104:58.37]He has like a poison scorpion pincer.
[105:00.05]Alright, back it off.
[105:10.04]Now my hit percentage is terrible right now.
[105:11.78]I need more will.
[105:15.98]Nice dodges.
[105:16.56]Good.
[105:17.06]Build up that will.
[105:17.72]That was a crit.
[105:19.28]30 damage.
[105:20.16]Excellento.
[105:22.76]Hey, who knew?
[105:24.72]Are we back to shitty PS1 games?
[105:26.26]This is not a shitty PS1.
[105:27.42]This is one of the best PS1 games ever made.
[105:31.87]Can we Wallace this?
[105:37.81]Crits are fair.
[105:40.39]Uh-oh.
[105:41.59]My internet's dying.
[105:45.24]That's not good.
[105:48.70]My frames are dropping right now.
[105:52.22]We're going to win this thing.
[105:56.48]This is round two.
[106:02.96]The game seems pretty well made.
[106:04.04]This is just yellow Barney.
[106:07.54]This is Big Bird and Barney.
[106:09.10]That's what he did.
[106:09.58]He put in Sesame Street, Sing Along, and Barney Loves You, the baby counting DVD.
[106:16.29]And they cut this.
[106:16.93]This is it.
[106:24.01]Oh, that was a bold move to start off with.
[106:28.34]Again, I'm going for bold, bold moves.
[106:33.70]Alright, let's play it.
[106:34.58]I gotta be smart here.
[106:35.25]This monster's a little confused.
[106:39.27]I'm not gonna go yet.
[106:39.91]I want the wheel to charge up.
[106:41.33]Let's go for a big one.
[106:42.13]21.
[106:42.41]Oh, he got confused.
[106:45.67]Shit.
[106:48.91]Go for it again.
[106:49.77]You can do it.
[106:52.36]Don't get too caught up in it.
[106:53.76]Don't get too caught up!
[106:57.34]Uh-oh.
[107:00.75]There it is.
[107:03.39]I got more health.
[107:10.34]Might lose this one.
[107:12.66]I gotta hit everything else.
[107:14.42]I gotta hit them all.
[107:19.39]Nice dodge.
[107:21.09]Fuck.
[107:22.59]I'm getting so... Yes!
[107:23.83]I won.
[107:27.14]Ooh, 48 to 46%.
[107:29.80]Yikes, that was close.
[107:36.47]Good work.
[107:40.85]TKO.
[107:44.61]Splicio wins, congratulations.
[107:47.47]Swept them all, didn't lose one time.
[107:56.51]I could never delete Splicio.
[108:00.01]1500 gold.
[108:03.75]Did I get some fame?
[108:04.67]Now I can't wait to see Splicio's fame status.
[108:08.05]I got 12 fans.
[108:08.95]12 people liked this video.
[108:12.27]12 people left that arena thinking I was kind of cool.
[108:15.13]Good.
[108:19.34]He's so great.
[108:20.60]Everybody loves Splicio.
[108:23.44]Congratulations on your win.
[108:24.68]You can go on to the next level.
[108:26.74]Praise him.
[108:29.06]Of course.
[108:33.00]Oh, Felicio seems very happy.
[108:37.11]Let's give him... 12 idiots.
[108:43.89]He deserves some meat for that one.
[108:47.91]12 idiots?
[108:48.33]What do you mean 12 idiots?
[108:50.69]Please sign here, please.
[108:53.41]I'm coming.
[108:55.05]Thank you, here you are.
[108:58.23]Oh, it's a fucking burnt cigar!
[109:01.45]What's in there?
[109:03.78]Thought it may be... what is it?
[109:06.60]Jeremy, in recognition of your ability, you are promoted to R1.
[109:09.60]A breeder's rank shows how skilled he is, Jeremy.
[109:13.84]You're on your way.
[109:15.24]Becoming a master breeder is every breeder's dream.
[109:17.45]We must work hard.
[109:20.63]Seems tight.
[109:21.11]Yeah, let's give him a good rest.
[109:24.11]He deserves it.
[109:24.65]What is that on the table in front of him?
[109:36.54]He's doing well.
[109:39.40]Now I can do some more work.
[109:45.24]Let's get that power up.
[109:50.81]Let me see what he's got.
[109:53.47]132.
[109:54.27]His defense is pretty terrible.
[109:56.08]His speed is awful.
[110:00.36]Should I just make him a heavy hitter and miss half the time?
[110:02.85]Doesn't even matter.
[110:03.35]What do you think?
[110:03.73]Let's get his defense up.
[110:09.20]He's the night watchman.
[110:10.98]Oh, is the criminal gonna sneak by?
[110:13.79]Got him.
[110:17.47]He's slow and dumb, but he's powerful.
[110:19.79]He's really strong.
[110:20.55]That's okay.
[110:25.09]Let's do logging.
[110:31.30]Oh no, he failed.
[110:36.13]No, no punishing.
[110:37.09]We don't do any negative reinforcement.
[110:39.35]Not at all.
[110:40.51]He's very happy.
[110:45.36]Let's do it again.
[110:46.78]Guard again.
[110:47.38]I want to get his defense up.
[110:49.70]No, no, he's asleep on the job.
[110:51.16]Don't wake up!
[110:52.78]No!
[110:56.06]Alright, now he's in trouble.
[110:57.32]Like, you're in trouble.
[110:59.08]Bad dog.
[111:00.61]Bad dog.
[111:02.57]Somebody just died because of you.
[111:08.57]I punished C. Yeah, because C sucked.
[111:13.71]He's gonna get spoiled.
[111:17.68]Now you have to only eat fucking potatoes for the next week.
[111:20.12]No, that's... I would never... No.
[111:25.16]Sleep.
[111:30.61]He's... Put him down.
[111:36.47]No.
[111:38.50]Uh, let's do some more work.
[111:39.58]What do we need?
[111:42.66]He needs speed.
[111:43.44]I'm gonna do speed like three or four times in a row.
[111:46.75]Speed and intelligence, but drops power.
[111:48.93]Is there anything that doesn't not drop?
[111:52.35]No, let's do forest like three or four times in a row.
[111:59.77]He did it!
[112:01.91]He's working too hard?
[112:03.01]No, he's not.
[112:08.69]He's doing just fine.
[112:12.47]Look, this guy eats better than most people.
[112:14.99]He gets fresh fish, fresh meat.
[112:18.52]He gets to sleep.
[112:20.24]All day.
[112:20.68]Let's do it again.
[112:24.58]I'm gonna get him above 90.
[112:34.96]That'll get him to 94.
[112:36.12]Let's get him over 100.
[112:38.37]That seems smart.
[112:43.17]Fresh fiss?
[112:45.41]Fresh fiss.
[112:47.33]Which item do you want to get?
[112:48.04]Oh, it's snowing.
[112:50.08]Stay with the fish.
[112:52.20]Is he cold?
[112:54.58]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[112:56.06]We've got to get him ready.
[112:58.77]He seems pretty tired.
[112:59.63]Uh, let him rest.
[113:05.62]Streamer overworks his child for money.
[113:12.64]Speed again.
[113:14.38]You can do it.
[113:17.85]He failed.
[113:18.25]Aww.
[113:22.01]It's okay.
[113:24.01]It's alright, don't worry.
[113:29.97]You do that, I'm telling you, twice in a row, though, and I'm going to have to call you a bad dog.
[113:34.95]There you go.
[113:40.00]Punish.
[113:40.34]Now it's cold outside.
[113:42.60]I'm not going to punish him.
[113:43.54]Here's the tournament.
[113:47.92]You should make a good showing.
[113:51.26]What's it look like here?
[113:52.12]132, 96.
[113:52.36]I don't know if he's ready for this next tournament, man.
[113:58.78]We got a D-grade tournament?
[114:01.24]Oh, he can do E. I don't have to do D. Yeah, let's just stay in the peewee leagues and just beat all the children at football.
[114:10.69]You know what I mean?
[114:14.41]Oh, his fame and loyalty will drop.
[114:17.33]You can't do that, huh?
[114:21.01]He's not ready.
[114:24.27]No, he's not ready.
[114:28.53]Not yet.
[114:32.25]We'll get the next one.
[114:41.10]His frame rate's gonna drop.
[114:46.86]Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
[114:49.58]Now how much is it to get him to actually train him?
[114:53.22]He's become too spoiled!
[114:54.14]What?
[114:55.32]Oh!
[115:05.73]Skill, intelligence, life.
[115:07.61]2,000?
[115:10.71]I don't have it.
[115:12.95]2,000.
[115:13.37]It's all 2,000, isn't it?
[115:19.18]Alright, we're gonna have to work him.
[115:22.46]Get into that forest again.
[115:23.36]Discipline.
[115:29.96]Don't let me ever have children.
[115:31.15]Oh, you only eat the best food.
[115:34.49]You only... You never get punished.
[115:36.97]No matter what happens.
[115:40.01]You're daddy's little angel.
[115:41.93]Nothing you do is ever wrong.
[115:50.84]Stress is gonna take away from his lifespan.
[115:53.02]But look at how happy he looks.
[115:55.82]Don't even tell me that you guys don't treat your dog like that.
[115:58.67]Please, come on.
[116:01.37]Everybody's dog can do no wrong.
[116:05.73]If your dog, like, shits in the house, or if your dog, like, pees on the couch, or rips up something, what do you do?
[116:12.87]You go, hey, don't do, no, don't do that, and then they, like, roll over on their back, and you're like, oh, what a good boy, and you don't even care.
[116:27.88]I do spoil my, I spoil the absolute hell out of my dog.
[116:33.84]My dog sleeps- What the hell is that?
[116:35.58]What, does he evolve?
[116:36.72]He evolved into like a spider!
[116:40.20]What?
[116:42.97]Holy shit, he can do that.
[116:46.77]The dog sleeps in bed.
[116:49.59]And he gets my spot in the bed.
[116:51.71]I have to curl up on the side and lie sideways and be half off the bed every night because my dog gets to sleep in my spot.
[117:02.72]He leveled up.
[117:03.24]Let's do... What does he need?
[117:10.79]I want to get him to level 3 power, which means he needs to be at like 150.
[117:16.73]So let's do that.
[117:17.91]Let's do 150, get him power, just drag the cart.
[117:24.62]He steals the blankets too, yes.
[117:31.55]I just I was told not we got he feels sorry.
[117:33.99]We can't spoil him.
[117:35.51]He'll get complacent We're gonna get that loyalty over 70 136 One stay with the fish
[117:59.11]He seems tired.
[117:59.89]Let's do it one more time, then he can go to sleep.
[118:08.25]Oh, come on.
[118:10.50]He was too tired.
[118:11.64]Don't punish him.
[118:12.22]He was sleepy.
[118:13.88]Put him in bed.
[118:17.02]He's very tired.
[118:18.14]Rest.
[118:18.84]You can sleep.
[118:22.18]Damn it.
[118:27.17]Punish him.
[118:29.84]I need to get him to level 3, and then I might be confident at that point.
[118:36.81]If he gets to level 3 power, then we'll take him to the next tournament.
[118:39.25]140 level up?
[118:43.94]No, it's probably 150.
[118:45.02]Do it again.
[118:56.61]I'm gonna work him to death.
[118:58.37]No, I'm not.
[118:59.13]He's gonna be fine.
[119:02.57]It's a shitty bug.
[119:03.58]What are you talking about just a shitty bug?
[119:07.94]By the way, do you see the year we're in?
[119:10.90]We're in the middle ages right now.
[119:12.30]Alright, here comes the official tournaments coming up here.
[119:15.72]Let's make sure he's rested.
[119:18.93]Make sure he's level 3 power.
[119:20.93]He's been spoiled too much.
[119:21.81]I just punished him.
[119:29.39]I just punished him.
[119:30.43]Alright, we're going to punish him here.
[119:32.87]Please feel sorry.
[119:40.94]He's very... What's the schedule look like?
[119:44.40]Oh, come on, dude.
[119:46.66]You only got... We have one... You have to get to sleep here.
[119:50.17]And then we have to do one more training.
[119:53.27]And then we have to... We gotta...
[120:01.13]You can sleep.
[120:02.95]And then you better get a red circle for this next thing.
[120:07.02]There's a rock monster that grows a beard?
[120:14.34]Stop feeding him so much!
[120:17.29]What do you mean?
[120:18.03]I don't want to just feed him potatoes!
[120:19.55]He won't be able to perform!
[120:27.32]You try to go into a battle sequence with a diet of potatoes.
[120:30.92]God damn it.
[120:47.30]Here comes the tournament.
[120:51.83]How's he doing?
[120:53.07]Seems well.
[120:54.85]We're gonna, uh, style firm.
[120:56.83]Oh, no, no, no, now I'm too, now I'm firm.
[120:58.61]I want to be normal.
[121:00.81]Firm.
[121:01.29]Let's go for it.
[121:11.02]Firm, but fair, right?
[121:12.70]Like, stern, but fair.
[121:20.90]Just like Dad, you know?
[121:22.28]Firm.
[121:24.11]But he gave me... I got to stay out till like 12 o'clock.
[121:26.45]That was my curfew.
[121:27.11]He was firm about that, though.
[121:28.17]You better come back at 12 o'clock.
[121:29.41]And I was like, I better.
[121:30.21]I will.
[121:31.59]He was good about it.
[121:37.18]This is a large battle.
[121:40.44]So we got Shplicio versus... Iguanissu.
[121:46.98]Good luck.
[121:47.86]It's another T-Rex monster looking thing.
[121:54.35]He's getting ready to evolve?
[121:55.39]You think so?
[121:57.33]Should we combine him with Elvis?
[122:02.36]This is the way we separate them.
[122:06.74]Let's see.
[122:07.12]Separate the men from the boys.
[122:11.28]That's pretty comparable.
[122:13.12]We just gotta make sure we land everything.
[122:19.39]Ah, went for it.
[122:24.22]Nice dodge.
[122:26.72]Hmm, he's a little confused here.
[122:29.76]Oh man, he was... Confirmed does not work.
[122:33.26]Confirmed.
[122:34.58]Hey, confirmed doesn't work.
[122:37.60]He just did a ton of damage to me.
[122:51.43]Nice.
[122:51.57]24 seconds.
[122:55.81]His monster's confused.
[122:56.76]Nice.
[123:00.38]Good job.
[123:00.78]Good work, good work.
[123:01.58]Dive.
[123:01.82]I'm gonna say another dive here.
[123:07.36]Alright, we're good.
[123:10.60]Even if I don't get a knockout.
[123:13.43]We're gonna TKO.
[123:15.45]Holy fuck!
[123:17.33]Don't do that again.
[123:18.45]Whoa.
[123:22.97]We win.
[123:26.35]I think somebody needs more defense.
[123:28.96]That sounds like the next course of action.
[123:30.96]It's a rock monster.
[123:38.54]Those things are scary.
[123:40.84]I'm going against the sheepdog, Mopeto.
[123:47.56]This is a big purse if we win.
[123:48.56]This is a thousand dollars if we win this.
[123:49.94]That means we can train him.
[123:52.56]We can go back to the market and buy stuff.
[123:56.72]I love this game.
[124:03.51]Going up against Sif.
[124:09.60]I don't know if we're going to win this one, though.
[124:12.70]He's just better in every category.
[124:13.96]Look at his speed.
[124:15.30]Mopeta was just the top seed.
[124:17.60]We just have to hope that we can dodge.
[124:26.20]And that's what we're talking about.
[124:27.02]We're talking about right off the bat.
[124:29.29]Do it again.
[124:30.65]Oh, don't get confused now.
[124:39.21]Back it up.
[124:45.18]That was a big hit in the beginning, but not gonna happen again.
[124:47.34]He won't let me close the gap.
[124:49.84]Damn it, again.
[124:53.55]Come on, man.
[124:54.39]What's with the dodge?
[124:55.17]That's bullshit.
[124:55.81]Now I'm out of will.
[124:56.63]I needed to hit at least one of those.
[125:00.71]Oh, lord.
[125:02.50]My hit percentage is so low right now.
[125:07.16]He's doing some good job dodging around.
[125:08.86]I don't think I can... No, don't... Wait, wait, wait.
[125:14.01]He's not prepared for this guy.
[125:18.41]He's holding up pretty well, though.
[125:22.61]I will say.
[125:23.11]Yeah, that's gonna be it.
[125:26.00]Wait a minute.
[125:27.82]Ah, it's alright.
[125:31.34]I tried to burn three hearts.
[125:33.62]I would have won there if I had at least one or two of those, but I only had like 20%.
[125:41.43]I was burning Will.
[125:42.79]It's alright.
[125:45.73]That guy's stats were like twice ours.
[125:51.91]I'll fucking freeze him.
[125:56.88]I'm gonna poison him offscreen.
[125:58.26]What are you guys talking about?
[126:03.54]He can still do it.
[126:04.10]I have confidence against, like, the Chewbacca one-eyed cow.
[126:13.55]Normally we would lose something like this, but his health is so low we just have to land a couple of moves.
[126:19.05]Right after that.
[126:21.77]Bingo.
[126:24.99]It's alright.
[126:34.42]41.
[126:37.44]That was a lot of damage too though.
[126:42.80]The hit percentage is too low.
[126:44.98]Come on!
[126:46.96]Give me something higher than 31% hit percentage!
[126:54.67]There it is.
[126:58.57]Really?
[127:03.79]Really?!
[127:08.47]Oh, that's such horseshit.
[127:09.39]Come on!
[127:09.87]Come on!
[127:10.17]Come on!
[127:10.41]Come on!
[127:10.59]Come on!
[127:10.75]Come on!
[127:11.93]Come on!
[127:15.64]Stay the fuck away from me!
[127:16.86]Come on!
[127:18.22]Get it!
[127:18.50]Yes!
[127:35.98]We've won two out of three here.
[127:40.20]Although going up against Goran, who's a giant rock.
[127:47.17]This guy's probably going to have a lot of health.
[127:52.47]This looks like Pokémon Stadium.
[127:53.63]It kind of is.
[127:59.41]This guy is 3-0.
[127:59.99]Okay, I don't know if we're going to beat Giant Rock Colossus Man.
[128:08.14]What has he got for stats?
[128:10.08]Oh, please.
[128:10.82]220 power, but his speed is so low.
[128:15.26]And his skill is low, too.
[128:16.54]I might be able to... If I dodge around... I might be okay.
[128:20.94]Okay.
[128:26.51]Nice, he missed.
[128:28.03]I'm gonna hold on to this for a second.
[128:30.09]He's got a really low percent chance to hit right now.
[128:34.75]Nice.
[128:35.25]Good.
[128:35.77]I'm gonna... Oh, come on.
[128:37.91]Really?
[128:41.49]Hold on to it.
[128:41.95]50%.
[128:41.97]3-0 my ass.
[128:51.16]Come on, I can beat him.
[128:59.70]His speed is so much lower than mine.
[129:01.44]I just have such an opportunity.
[129:02.54]He's just running out of stamina!
[129:04.90]He's got no will!
[129:06.32]I can't close the gap, though.
[129:07.22]I have to wait.
[129:14.73]I can't move back.
[129:15.65]He's too, like, big, I think.
[129:17.85]There we go.
[129:23.78]Didn't even take one hit.
[129:27.13]3-0 my ass.
[129:28.01]Now I'm poised to win.
[129:29.55]I just have to beat the next guy.
[129:36.61]How many times did the first enemy hit me?
[129:44.22]Oh dude, Iguana lost so many times in a row.
[129:46.32]Okay, this is versus Whirl.
[129:48.84]What is Whirl?
[129:49.48]3-1?
[129:51.18]I'm also 3-1.
[129:52.12]This is it.
[129:53.46]This is the championship.
[129:57.83]Yeah, whoever wins this wins.
[129:59.13]So I gotta... This is for the money.
[130:08.14]Using cheat codes.
[130:14.38]Alright, come on.
[130:16.10]He's like a gray dinosaur with red eyes.
[130:19.64]He probably has great stats.
[130:24.34]Yeah, he's just balanced across the board.
[130:26.16]We have to focus on...
[130:31.40]I don't know.
[130:32.62]Everything he has is better than me.
[130:35.01]We have to karate kid this situation right now and use all of our strength.
[130:41.55]Here we go.
[130:52.50]Oh, man.
[130:53.10]Wow.
[130:57.46]This is not... I don't know if this is gonna look good.
[130:58.84]I gotta hit him with something big.
[131:00.46]That's pretty big.
[131:02.90]That's pretty big too!
[131:03.75]No!
[131:05.55]That was a big hit!
[131:30.70]Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back!
[131:36.94]No!
[131:38.94]I didn't do it.
[131:39.52]We're gonna get TKO'd.
[131:43.27]It's alright.
[131:46.37]I held up pretty well for having, you know, like 30% less stats than this guy.
[131:51.33]It's okay.
[131:59.53]Close.
[132:02.22]Put him in the fucking freezer.
[132:06.78]Let's see what the actual standings are.
[132:08.18]I think you get something for being in second place.
[132:10.02]Yeah, Whirl just wiped the floor with everybody.
[132:14.48]Who did he lose to?
[132:17.79]Did he lose to...
[132:21.66]I can't see who won.
[132:23.18]Did I beat him earlier?
[132:24.30]It's alright.
[132:27.66]Here's the prize money.
[132:28.34]I got in second place.
[132:29.46]You still get money.
[132:33.66]I got fans, too.
[132:36.46]He lost to the rock monster.
[132:38.18]Okay.
[132:39.62]It looks like it lost to me.
[132:40.52]That's weird.
[132:44.61]He did a good job.
[132:46.61]He lost to the worst monster.
[132:48.13]The rock monster was 3-0 until I fought him.
[132:52.64]He tried his best.
[132:53.40]Yes, encourage him.
[132:57.87]27 fucking idiots.
[133:05.94]Let's give him some actual training.
[133:10.72]So I can rest.
[133:12.48]We'll put him through training.
[133:23.34]Let's go to town for a second.
[133:26.82]Let's see what we can do here.
[133:29.46]You want to fuse him with Elvis?
[133:31.88]Should we fuse him with Elvis Presley?
[133:34.51]Let's go to the market.
[133:37.29]I got two grand.
[133:39.21]If you have a monster that you no longer need, I'll take him.
[133:42.13]Is it okay to get rid of Splishio?
[133:44.93]No.
[133:47.91]Lab?
[133:48.29]Freeze, revive, delete, combine...
[133:56.65]Um... No.
[134:00.94]Fuse.
[134:01.58]Fuse.
[134:02.46]Sell him.
[134:04.56]No, he's getting bigger.
[134:05.34]He's doing better.
[134:08.34]Delete.
[134:10.24]I'm not deleting him.
[134:11.05]He's too good.
[134:15.11]Cannibalize Elvis.
[134:18.07]Train Elvis first.
[134:19.29]Okay, we're gonna freeze him.
[134:22.44]We're gonna freeze...
[134:26.95]Let's go to the lab.
[134:27.67]Let's freeze Shplicio and bring out Elvis.
[134:32.95]Right.
[134:33.29]Okay.
[134:33.65]Freeze him.
[134:37.13]We're gonna... Now I'm gonna start training Elvis.
[134:39.00]I mean, don't do it.
[134:42.52]He'll be fine.
[134:43.30]He's going into cryogenic sleep.
[134:44.70]He's fine.
[134:45.18]You don't lose anything for doing this.
[134:49.34]You can bring him back.
[134:56.64]Don't make him.
[134:59.52]Now we're gonna bring out Elvis.
[135:06.64]Lab.
[135:08.22]Revive.
[135:09.00]There we go.
[135:09.94]Elvis.
[135:12.12]Elv- Hold- Elv- Elv- Elvis is way better!
[135:14.96]Hold on a second here.
[135:15.88]What the fuck?
[135:18.02]Look at Elvis' stats!
[135:20.78]Hold- Wait.
[135:21.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[135:24.15]What is EarnCat's stats?
[135:30.96]The worm was the worst character that we had!
[135:39.23]Is he fucking serious?
[135:42.79]Let's see, what about C?
[135:44.80]Alright, C sucks.
[135:45.98]C is... Okay, Elvis is way better.
[135:48.44]We're gonna play with Elvis.
[135:53.08]Look at these stats!
[135:57.71]Think about the abilities.
[135:58.85]Yeah, but I mean, we're talking about the 20 or 30 more stat points in almost every single category.
[136:11.65]Alright, let's go.
[136:13.11]Back to the branch.
[136:19.09]Less HP in defense, we can train that.
[136:24.42]Fuse Elvis in the worm.
[136:27.59]I will.
[136:29.26]After we train him a little bit.
[136:33.28]So let's see, what do you got?
[136:34.04]A life.
[136:35.36]Let's train life and defense.
[136:36.62]Because we don't need... He has more power than the bug... He has more power, more intelligence, he's got everything.
[136:43.30]Let's go with life and... What was the other one?
[136:45.98]Life and defense.
[136:46.66]I think there actually is a life and defense, isn't there?
[136:49.14]There's power and life.
[136:52.10]Life and defense.
[136:52.68]There it is.
[136:53.97]Bingo.
[136:56.84]Get in there, bunny.
[137:01.44]He is undefeated at this point.
[137:08.55]Do it again.
[137:12.05]Life and defense.
[137:13.43]I know I'm dropping skill, but it's okay.
[137:15.39]His skill's high enough where he needs life and defense.
[137:17.77]Bad.
[137:18.01]And then we're gonna fuse them together.
[137:27.78]Can you turn down the RPG Maker music a little before I hear it in my sleep?
[137:31.56]Alright, you want me to turn down the music?
[137:37.29]Can I turn?
[137:37.75]I don't think I even can turn.
[137:38.73]There's no, like, audio options, probably.
[137:41.25]Don't decrease his skill.
[137:42.31]Well, he needs it.
[137:43.85]His loyalty is so bad, too.
[137:45.21]Just sleep for a while.
[137:54.56]Loyalty 1.
[137:59.55]Let's give him fish.
[138:02.75]Elvis as well.
[138:08.79]I can't afford actual training.
[138:14.52]Life.
[138:16.08]This is about $2,000 for more life.
[138:20.40]I'm doing it.
[138:22.42]This could end up being our number one.
[138:30.22]Nice hit.
[138:32.82]Do it again.
[138:36.11]One more.
[138:36.43]Headbutt.
[138:37.63]Come on, Elvis.
[138:43.69]Come on.
[138:47.39]Yeah, there's more.
[138:48.39]Six more health, right?
[138:49.37]Yep.
[138:52.01]One more.
[138:52.31]Three to four.
[138:56.64]Wow, you've just wasted $2,000.
[139:02.35]That's a person.
[139:03.17]That's somebody in like a fursuit.
[139:09.11]Splicio worked for that money.
[139:22.04]You get old potatoes.
[139:25.79]Splicio worked for that money.
[139:28.15]How dare you.
[139:33.05]Alright.
[139:33.51]What do we got for a battle?
[139:34.27]How are we doing on stats?
[139:36.70]His loyalty is terrible.
[139:43.98]What a waste of... I got 12 health points.
[139:46.08]Let's do some more speed.
[139:51.29]He is a rabbit for Christ's sake.
[139:57.11]You find it?
[139:57.65]Got a couple of shrooms.
[139:58.43]Good.
[140:03.86]He got rid of the worm and things went downhill real quick.
[140:07.06]You know what?
[140:09.92]If you discipline your monster hard, he may get hurt or run away.
[140:13.74]Skills develop with work.
[140:17.11]Yeah, I don't want him to run away.
[140:19.59]It says even.
[140:21.17]The greater your monster's power is, the more devastating your monster's... I'm going to read some of these.
[140:28.35]The higher int is, the better your monster's long range.
[140:32.16]That's actually pretty important.
[140:35.15]The higher skill, the better your monster's hit percentage is.
[140:37.43]That's also important.
[140:39.65]Speed is... Better monster can dodge upon its attacks, right?
[140:47.92]So, yeah.
[140:50.76]I feel like we need... We need some more skill.
[140:54.48]Do it again.
[140:56.74]I love how they have different animations for every character, and that was a total failure.
[141:03.60]That was me.
[141:07.51]Uh, this guy sucks.
[141:15.37]Elvis seems a bit vulnerable.
[141:16.62]If he gets KO'd, he may die.
[141:18.66]Uh, okay, well... I don't think we should put him... put him in a tournament.
[141:31.53]If he might die.
[141:36.06]Combine him with the worm, but... I don't want to... This guy kind of sucks.
[141:41.24]I feel like we should breed a new one.
[141:42.97]His loyalty is better.
[141:53.27]Just dump the defense and have good speed.
[141:54.87]That's not a bad idea.
[141:55.71]Let's see... Power and life.
[142:00.74]Minus defense.
[142:01.50]Infant skill.
[142:02.52]Speed and power down.
[142:06.36]Let's just go with speed.
[142:13.80]Three.
[142:14.56]Look, he can't do anything right!
[142:16.62]He can't do anything right!
[142:19.19]He's- I've worked him like eight times.
[142:23.03]And he's only succeeded like three times.
[142:25.97]He's terrible.
[142:36.60]I spent two grand on him.
[142:38.68]You want- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[142:40.73]You want me to fuse them?
[142:44.95]Should we try it?
[142:46.81]Alright, we're gonna fuse them.
[142:49.57]This is what everybody wants.
[142:53.83]Combine.
[142:55.15]You can't as long as you have one on the ranch, so I have to freeze him.
[143:00.85]Freeze.
[143:02.61]Combine.
[143:08.10]You need 500 gold to combine.
[143:09.98]I don't have 500 gold.
[143:11.11]Alright, melt them.
[143:21.95]We're gonna train them more.
[143:24.69]Wake up.
[143:25.07]It's time to scan again.
[143:33.65]Sell C. Sell C. Do you get money?
[143:40.67]Go back in the freezer.
[143:46.97]Lab revive.
[143:49.15]Let's revive C and sell him.
[143:52.29]I spent like $3,000 on this stupid fucking character.
[143:55.17]He's back.
[144:04.03]Yeah, monster, I'll take him.
[144:05.49]Is it okay to get rid of C?
[144:06.79]Yes.
[144:07.49]Thank you.
[144:09.43]I got zero dollars for that.
[144:10.83]I didn't get paid any money.
[144:12.05]He just got deleted from my inventory.
[144:15.95]Bye, C. You're never gonna get seen ever again.
[144:18.61]I just got scammed.
[144:28.09]Alright, let's pull the rabbit back out.
[144:29.97]Let's get him in a...
[144:32.70]Hold on, let me see, let me see.
[144:33.42]Do I have any of the CDs?
[144:36.76]I'm gonna go, like, let's go to Point Blank.
[144:39.48]Point Blank is, like, one of my favorite PlayStation games.
[144:41.18]I'm gonna put it in.
[144:41.78]Let's see what we get.
[144:44.31]It's right over here.
[144:57.25]Let's make a new one.
[145:03.79]C got turned into glue.
[145:05.13]Alright, would you like to try?
[145:09.47]Yes.
[145:10.53]So we're going to put in... Here you go.
[145:14.13]We're going to put in point blank three.
[145:16.55]That's what's going in next.
[145:26.79]Read it.
[145:30.70]Small CDs like the GameCube work too.
[145:38.55]Put in 3D Movie Maker.
[145:41.83]Alright, here we go.
[145:42.81]What did we get from Point Blank?
[145:47.29]No, I just... I was about to put Shanghai Noon back in there.
[145:52.99]I was gonna be really freaked out about that.
[145:55.59]Alright.
[146:04.50]Here is the big moment.
[146:09.50]Put in Dark Souls?
[146:10.68]I haven't owned like a PC.
[146:11.88]I actually have a lot of random PC games down here.
[146:14.90]What the fuck is that?
[146:18.59]This is a brick of tofu.
[146:23.73]That's the dumbest monster ever.
[146:25.59]It's just a sponge.
[146:29.04]A mono.
[146:29.70]Mono.
[146:30.24]Mono.
[146:34.02]Oh, cool.
[146:34.44]The dirty sponge.
[146:39.03]Wow, what a monster.
[146:41.85]That's a funny looking monster.
[146:43.15]You have to give him a name.
[146:44.29]Yeah.
[146:45.57]D-Sponge.
[146:52.35]This is just that stupid unlockable Resident Evil character.
[146:59.76]Yes.
[147:01.82]Okay.
[147:03.04]I want to know what the fuck this guy's got.
[147:05.42]What's we got for data?
[147:12.63]That's pretty well balanced.
[147:15.53]It's a pretty balanced monster.
[147:18.46]You got a lot of defense.
[147:20.02]He is just a wall.
[147:20.92]Let's train him a little bit.
[147:26.34]Let's play with him.
[147:26.76]See what he does.
[147:33.49]I want to take this guy back to the ranch.
[147:35.43]What happens if we combine a wall with a worm?
[147:46.17]This is fucking stupid.
[147:49.71]Why?
[147:50.27]Why is this sentient?
[147:54.80]This is just somebody's glass door.
[148:03.79]Okay, uh, what should I do to him?
[148:07.39]Maybe a little more life and, uh... Speed?
[148:10.63]Life and power?
[148:11.23]Okay.
[148:18.85]Like, congratulations.
[148:19.87]Somebody in Minecraft made cobblestone slabs, and I took one.
[148:24.33]And it's alive.
[148:27.27]So let's do power and life.
[148:29.57]Those, I feel like... What is this?
[148:32.05]Minus speed.
[148:32.80]Who gives a shit?
[148:36.97]It has a face.
[148:41.29]What the fuck?
[148:46.07]Okay, no, wait.
[148:46.79]This is just one of those needle... Novelty needle toys that you put your face in and the needles all hit you.
[148:53.78]And it's the outline of your face.
[148:54.98]This guy's freaking me out.
[149:05.16]We need to use this guy for a little while.
[149:11.79]Don't fail again, or you're going into the fucking friolator.
[149:14.85]Oh, god damn it.
[149:31.31]Put this insult to God out of its misery.
[149:36.32]Just go to bed.
[149:37.04]Try again tomorrow.
[149:45.12]Oh no, our sentient duct tape sure is having a lot of fun sleeping.
[149:52.45]What does it eat?
[149:54.27]How does it eat?
[149:58.63]What is this plus life?
[150:01.03]Logging.
[150:08.80]He did it.
[150:09.14]He winked at it and it fell down.
[150:18.20]I'm gonna put him into a fight.
[150:22.40]Next week.
[150:23.10]I wanna see what this guy can do.
[150:26.34]Remember how Wormy never let you down and you still tossed him aside for all these bad monsters?
[150:37.70]Let's let him sleep.
[150:43.72]We'll do the next available.
[150:49.25]Tournament.
[150:53.77]I got the same monster from a Dell install CD.
[150:57.05]He kicked ass in battle.
[151:10.55]That's so fucking funny.
[151:15.11]Let's do life again.
[151:23.37]Why?
[151:23.87]Oh, come on, dude.
[151:27.77]Let's do- time for a battle.
[151:30.63]If- alright, if you- how about this?
[151:32.55]If this guy loses one fight, he's getting put in the fry later.
[151:38.78]We'll let him have one opportunity.
[151:45.72]Battle.
[151:46.82]Here's your one opportunity.
[151:53.20]Good luck.
[151:55.30]He better get in first place or he's getting dunked.
[151:57.78]The cricket cup.
[152:08.28]Battle will begin.
[152:09.71]D Sponge versus Barura.
[152:15.29]I don't know what his moves are.
[152:16.29]Let's see what they are.
[152:19.63]Harsh but firm.
[152:20.97]That's right.
[152:31.36]He's pretty big, too.
[152:34.06]That's such a boring monster to have.
[152:35.76]Why would you want to have this monster?
[152:37.40]That's so dull.
[152:38.32]What is the green move?
[152:44.96]Do I chomp-womp him?
[152:46.18]Like in Mario?
[152:46.62]That's what I'm going to turn into, right?
[152:52.34]You actually do the chomp-womp.
[152:59.72]He's got a laser beam that comes out of his mouth?
[153:03.28]Wait a minute.
[153:08.92]Okay.
[153:12.13]Well, I need to get better percentages here.
[153:16.29]Actually, not that bad.
[153:20.01]I want to hit a laser.
[153:20.93]We need to see what it looks like.
[153:24.62]Oh, you dumb asshole.
[153:26.96]There it is.
[153:29.80]That's pretty good.
[153:31.46]That really is not that bad.
[153:38.50]Why is that a move?
[153:44.20]Lovecraftian nightmare.
[153:52.19]Monels are fucking sweet.
[153:54.79]So what happens if you combine a Monel and a Worm?
[153:57.59]Should I do that?
[154:00.48]I'm gonna have the money to do it.
[154:12.20]The backflips.
[154:15.48]Turn him into a monoworm.
[154:20.80]Combine him and Elvis?
[154:24.92]Yeah, we can't get rid of Wormy.
[154:30.51]I probably will win this tournament though.
[154:35.07]Wouldn't be surprised.
[154:40.72]That burn is awesome.
[154:46.28]Just waiting for that good percentage.
[154:47.80]More than 50 and not even worth swinging.
[154:55.38]Yeah, we got this.
[154:59.01]I'm gonna get a clean 500 bucks, which is enough to meld him into somebody else.
[155:04.66]We're both confused, alright.
[155:13.42]I actually like his move.
[155:14.18]He's got a good long-range move.
[155:18.14]Yo, this wall is actually like the best monster.
[155:20.34]Don't merge him.
[155:24.16]Maybe I shouldn't.
[155:25.98]He really does seem like he's really, really good.
[155:33.42]Yeah, we ain't gonna merge this guy.
[155:34.80]We're gonna keep him.
[155:47.52]Merge Elvis and the worm.
[155:48.82]That's what we're gonna do.
[155:50.82]This guy's too weird to merge him.
[155:52.04]I don't want to turn him into something else.
[155:56.58]This has been a free tournament, though.
[155:58.04]This is as free as you could get.
[156:09.49]Let's go with a really... Let's go with up close.
[156:11.25]Just smash him in the head.
[156:13.41]Let me go for like two or three times in a row.
[156:17.50]Or not.
[156:19.44]Or not.
[156:19.94]Come on.
[156:22.18]Don't lose here.
[156:23.88]That would be embarrassing if you lost this.
[156:28.70]Come on.
[156:30.68]Where's your skill?
[156:31.24]I need more skill.
[156:36.20]50%.
[156:36.26]There you go.
[156:37.22]Oh my lord.
[156:38.66]He's really blowing it right now.
[156:40.92]He's blowing it.
[156:41.64]Look at this.
[156:41.98]I can't do a move.
[156:44.07]He's blowing it, man.
[156:50.51]This is not good.
[156:55.65]Get it.
[156:59.53]What's the percentage here?
[157:00.29]Yeah, I still won.
[157:02.43]Couldn't get anything.
[157:08.29]You chose a bed bug ridden mattress you found on the street over a worm that loves you.
[157:17.58]You're not wrong.
[157:26.40]That's 500 bucks.
[157:33.28]That's not terrifying at all.
[157:36.53]I put my face in the spikes.
[157:39.63]That's a lot of money.
[157:40.63]Why did I get so much money?
[157:44.74]Well, less people care about him than cared about Worm.
[157:52.25]Merge.
[157:53.19]I have enough money to merge.
[157:54.93]We're going to merge the Worm and Elvis.
[158:05.22]He's very tired, yes he is.
[158:08.62]Have some rest.
[158:14.67]Don't do that.
[158:16.39]No, not the worm.
[158:24.12]Merge Elvis in the other thing.
[158:26.86]Alright, fine.
[158:27.42]We're gonna merge Elvis in the cat urn from Meet the Fockers.
[158:34.88]Yeah, that's fair.
[158:35.71]We're gonna merge those two.
[158:39.91]No worm, no wall.
[158:41.97]See what we get from Meat the Fockers.
[158:44.79]And... Let's freeze him.
[158:51.54]Oh, his animation sure does change when he's frozen.
[158:53.36]Alright, combine.
[158:56.92]500 gold to combine.
[159:00.70]Monster mode is gonna be Earn Cat.
[159:05.19]Yes.
[159:07.55]Monster 2 is going to be Elvis.
[159:10.00]Proceed.
[159:12.16]Do you want to use an item?
[159:14.26]Yes, I do.
[159:16.22]No items.
[159:18.02]That's alright.
[159:18.90]We have an opportunity to get a Prince.
[159:22.20]A nice combination.
[159:22.85]You'll surely get a better one.
[159:23.85]Proceed.
[159:25.03]We might get a Rover, Hare, Pulsar, Balloon, Sapphire, or Prince.
[159:34.78]Despun mistake Mono and rabbit is actually really good Do we can always just put like a cup we can always put more CDs in we're doing it What we're gonna get merge them together
[160:03.00]It's another fucking Elvis cat.
[160:22.17]I mean, hold on a minute there.
[160:23.17]I was gonna bring him to the guy and he was gonna be free.
[160:31.02]But he's got 160 power.
[160:36.64]Free as in I was going to bring him to the market and it was going to be free.
[160:40.72]So like, hey, take this.
[160:41.58]Is it free?
[160:42.06]Yes, it's free.
[160:42.70]Take it.
[160:43.00]This guy's really good.
[160:48.72]Okay, we're going to freeze him.
[160:51.47]We're going to put another CD in.
[160:52.79]Let's see.
[160:53.07]Let me... I have a burnable CD.
[160:55.09]Give me a second.
[160:55.67]I'm going to fucking scream into an audio file and put it on a burnable CD.

[165:10.23]I want to see if like, can I even burn discs?
[165:13.77]First I have to scream.
[165:14.65]This is going to take a minute.
[165:16.35]Jesus Christ, hold on.
[165:17.63]Give me another, give me like another two minutes.
[166:47.28]Okay, I got it.

[172:02.29]I'll just show it on just so you guys see that this is no fucking fools.
[172:05.79]No tricks.
[172:09.07]This is actually a burnt CD.
[172:10.95]That was point blank, but look.
[172:13.14]This is an old CD-R.
[172:14.98]A Maxwell CD-R.
[172:17.68]This is legit.
[172:19.56]And you can take it, I don't know if you can see this, look, you can see the burn?
[172:22.60]You see the, the, that you can tell when the CD's burnt?
[172:25.64]See the ring?
[172:27.40]This is for real.
[172:29.46]I'm ready.
[172:29.84]Let's see what it does.
[172:31.12]Let's go to the shrine.
[172:41.96]Oh, I need to unplug this again.
[172:44.94]Sorry, you're gonna get like a Windows notification.
[172:54.10]2000 Aerotechnics.
[172:55.22]We'd like to try it.
[172:55.96]It's going in.
[172:59.95]Insert another CD.
[173:01.69]You got it.
[173:06.49]Why is there hair all over this?
[173:13.76]It's going to crash.
[173:21.82]It's working.
[173:23.67]Done.
[173:24.91]We got ourselves a monster.
[173:34.93]I'm excited to see what this could be.
[173:36.25]Because I have no idea.
[173:42.04]Here is the big moment.
[173:43.06]There's
[173:54.98]What is it?
[174:00.55]It's a T-Rex!
[174:03.59]Oh yeah!
[174:06.33]It's the Rex from Toy Story!
[174:19.02]That's a really good looking monster.
[174:20.38]You have to give him a name.
[174:23.60]What's the Toy Story Rex's name?
[174:30.02]The embodiment of my scream.
[174:34.80]It roared the scream.
[174:38.89]There's my spirit animal.
[174:40.09]It's just like a shitty little tiny dumb T-Rex.
[174:43.63]Great.
[174:44.79]I'm excited about that spirit animal.
[174:46.53]Why can't he be 200 fucking feet tall?
[174:55.52]This is going to be Screech.
[175:00.10]I like Screeks.
[175:04.72]T-Jex.
[175:05.92]Jax Rex.
[175:07.65]I like Jax Rex.
[175:09.03]Jax Rex is pretty good.
[175:11.47]Jax Rex.
[175:14.19]Jax Rex.
[175:26.01]There he is.
[175:28.07]He shall never be deleted.
[175:33.91]We also... I'm going to freeze him because I have a few more CDs here I want to use.
[175:38.37]Just for fun.
[175:40.17]Let's freeze Jax Rex.
[175:41.76]Let's take a look and see if this could be attributed to me.
[175:48.76]Power is alright.
[175:49.44]Skills... This guy... This is awful.
[175:51.98]This is really not that good.
[175:57.92]It's pretty mediocre.
[175:59.30]The stats are not good.
[176:01.32]Shrine, this time... I mean, I feel like we're gonna get something pretty good out of this.
[176:08.66]This is... Um... Yep.
[176:15.68]In this one, we have... We're gonna go for WWF The Music, Volume 3.
[176:23.39]As you can see there, this is a WWF soundtrack for all your favorite wrestlers.
