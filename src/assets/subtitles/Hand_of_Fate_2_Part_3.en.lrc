[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.95]Still dead.
[00:06.25]What?
[00:09.97]No, I'm here, right?
[00:12.13]I'm live.
[00:12.65]I should be.
[00:22.42]I am.
[00:22.80]Oh, you are?
[00:23.22]Okay.
[00:24.56]Well.
[00:27.36]Well.
[00:33.75]Let's just ride this out for a second.
[00:40.73]Everyone's back to voting.
[00:47.74]Yeah, so if you weren't here, I think the Twitch server that I was streaming to... It crashed.
[00:57.25]It died.
[00:58.45]My internet's fine.
[00:59.43]I think it was just... I was streaming to...
[01:02.49]One of the US East servers.
[01:03.87]And I think it may have just collapsed.
[01:06.41]We'll see.
[01:08.33]So we're going to go for one.
[01:09.98]Because that's obviously it.
[01:11.12]And it's not.
[01:12.02]At all.
[01:13.14]And that's the end of the game.
[01:18.78]His skeletal kidnapper is gone.
[01:20.14]And thankfully he's right here.
[01:21.38]Which will give us one opportunity.
[01:26.78]Yeah, some other people's streams died too.
[01:30.10]Well, yeah.
[01:30.46]So it's like a Twitch thing.
[01:33.39]We're back.
[01:33.89]We're here.
[01:34.65]We're good.
[01:36.89]Don't lie.
[01:37.37]You unplugged your internet.
[01:38.60]What?
[01:40.26]Don't tell them that.
[01:43.20]All right.
[01:43.50]We might be able to do this.
[01:44.94]I just don't want to eat any food.
[01:46.18]So we're going to go left and then up.
[01:49.25]And there he is.
[01:51.89]Osman in trouble.
[01:52.93]You find Osman being dragged towards an open tomb by a cadaver of skeletons.
[02:07.16]My viewers keep going to zero.
[02:08.89]I think Twitch is just fucked up right now.
[02:11.65]I have zero viewers right now.
[02:13.83]I gotta pay attention.
[02:14.73]This is important.
[02:20.76]Oh my god, he's dead.
[02:22.58]How do I stop him from... He's gonna die.
[02:27.47]It's game over.
[02:40.93]God damn it!
[02:55.20]Don't die!
[03:00.44]Where is he?
[03:07.02]Don't you dare!
[03:12.69]Okay, I really had to, like, actually pay attention there.
[03:20.24]Twitch is, like, so fucked up.
[03:27.00]Saved.
[03:27.48]Good babysitting.
[03:31.89]Uh, you rummage through the bones or anything of use.
[03:35.73]Braggart.
[03:37.07]Gain plus 15 fame until you lose any gambit.
[03:40.69]Then discard the card.
[03:42.04]Okay.
[03:44.64]Okay, so here we go.
[03:50.64]Go ahead and call me whatever you want to call me.
[03:55.61]You wonder how it's possible that somebody would want to kill Osman this much, even if it's out of love.
[04:00.53]You keep a close eye on the potato farmer.
[04:01.97]Surely he won't be kidnapped again.
[04:03.71]So go ahead and call me whatever you want.
[04:06.87]You can call me a loser.
[04:08.79]Call me a cheater.
[04:10.25]Call me a piece of shit.
[04:12.25]That's okay.
[04:14.57]Oswin has two health.
[04:16.69]And we're going to cheat.
[04:18.29]I'm just going to walk back and forth until I get like five more food.
[04:21.95]Go ahead and call me whatever you want.
[04:27.29]Call me anything.
[04:28.05]I don't care.
[04:28.83]I'm winning this one.
[04:30.89]Wait, give me some food.
[04:32.65]Vote for A. Get A on the plate here.
[04:41.79]We're using cheats now, motherfucker.
[04:47.77]Look at that.
[04:48.33]Here we go.
[04:50.69]That's all I needed.
[04:54.49]That's all I needed, guys.
[04:56.79]Thanks.
[04:57.57]Appreciate it.
[04:59.55]Wait, what?
[05:03.27]Wait, this is not the exit.
[05:04.80]Where's the exit?
[05:07.90]No matter what is in front of you, it allows you to pick a safe path through the wilds.
[05:11.67]Huh?
[05:21.90]Oh, well.
[05:32.06]King of one.
[05:40.15]All right, somebody in the chat just said they were 100% confident that it's two.
[05:46.97]They were 100% confident.
[05:51.10]I want everyone to remember that that guy said that.
[05:55.10]He was 100% confident.
[06:19.28]Where's this card?
[06:20.16]I've always been in trouble.
[06:23.18]General store.
[06:23.72]General store.
[06:24.34]The lovers.
[06:24.78]I've got to go down.
[06:27.78]Fuck.
[06:30.28]Can I have some more food?
[06:31.75]Hey, guys.
[06:33.67]Can I have a little more food, please?
[06:37.75]Oh, wait a minute.
[06:40.29]Don't even need it.
[06:40.83]Because look.
[06:41.21]Here we go.
[06:41.55]Watch this.
[06:44.65]I revealed the whole thing.
[06:46.15]So everything is revealed.
[06:47.03]So I'm going to get the token here.
[06:48.77]Because if you reveal the whole thing and then go here... Now I get money.
[06:55.39]So there are nine revealed encounters except 18 gold as payment.
[07:00.22]Wait, no, I actually don't have them all revealed, do I?
[07:02.24]Yeah, I do.
[07:02.58]Give me that money.
[07:07.02]Spend several hours telling him until it's ready.
[07:08.90]I guess, no, that has to be everything.
[07:11.75]Oh my fucking god.
[07:12.99]Can you wait until we... He's dead.
[07:18.45]No, not if you get it.
[07:19.37]Please get this right.
[07:20.15]Everyone pay attention now.
[07:22.45]Pay attention, everybody.
[07:25.89]This makes or breaks everything.
[07:30.75]Come on, get it right.
[07:33.33]Oswald is dead if we don't get this right.
[07:43.55]hundred percent confident it's three this better not be a boy who cried wolf situation because this is this is a unanimous majority says it's one thank the lord you quickly rise to your feet and draw your weapon
[08:09.64]He still, but he still has 20 health.
[08:11.08]Oh, I gotta do the, I gotta clutch this out babysitter style.
[08:15.83]He only has, he needs like two hits.
[08:24.97]Oh, he's dead.
[08:26.27]Don't say that.
[08:29.11]Just keep them back.
[08:37.13]Keep them back!
[08:38.82]Don't step in any grenades, dude.
[08:42.14]Right in the center of them.
[08:48.71]Is he fighting somebody back here?
[08:50.27]No, he is!
[08:54.29]No, he's being surrounded!
[08:59.31]No!
[09:03.89]I gotta get the guy with the grenade!
[09:04.89]Guy with the grenade!
[09:05.49]Guy with the grenade!
[09:21.95]Not if I haven't anything to say about it.
[09:32.37]Can Oswald die in combat?
[09:34.44]I'm sure he can.
[09:35.62]He's at 6 health.
[09:36.52]10 max health.
[09:39.92]Good.
[09:41.38]5 food.
[09:44.24]Fall back asleep.
[09:46.40]Let's heal him.
[09:47.61]This might be the end here.
[09:55.33]Uh, okay.
[09:56.27]Heal him.
[09:58.29]But I need to get him past 20%.
[10:00.11]Like, I'd rather take damage.
[10:01.91]I'm going to take damage.
[10:05.25]But he needs to live.
[10:07.99]And I can buy food.
[10:12.33]Let's buy food.
[10:15.05]This dude only has one food?
[10:17.87]Why?
[10:18.25]Why don't you... What?
[10:24.45]Shit.
[10:28.34]Well, I'm gonna do it again.
[10:29.48]Okay.
[10:38.11]I need this last food here.
[10:40.24]I think that should be good.
[10:43.54]Break camp.
[10:49.68]Let's do it.
[10:50.54]The lovers.
[10:55.53]With a shout of relief, Osmund announces that Nightshade Copse is just over the hill.
[11:00.91]Go forth to Nightshade Copse.
[11:02.83]The village looks abandoned.
[11:06.26]The sky darkens.
[11:07.40]In the town square stands a beautiful woman, her skin gray and mottled.
[11:11.66]You feel a sudden chill in the air.
[11:14.12]The woman's voice grates and hisses, as if long unused.
[11:19.57]Dearest Oswin, you have come for me?
[11:24.39]Entranced, the potato farmer takes a step.
[11:26.89]You grab his shoulder, breaking the spell and spilling your drink.
[11:31.11]The woman squints in your direction.
[11:34.73]Oswin, who is this?
[11:38.98]Your companion looks to you.
[11:41.12]Still in a daze, you notice that somehow he is clutching a potato.
[11:45.69]Oswin grips the potato in both hands.
[11:47.61]He looks back at his lover in defiance.
[11:51.70]This is my friend!
[11:53.72]A heartbroken screech retches from the woman and she doubles over in pain.
[11:59.64]Horrified, you watch as her face twists and hollows and her limbs lengthen until before you stands a shade swirling with fury.
[12:10.13]Oh, Lord.
[12:10.99]The ghostly figure lifts her arms and begins to rise into the air.
[12:14.67]Hold on.
[12:15.01]Do I already think that's good against ghosts?
[12:21.77]This is it, right?
[12:22.43]I don't have anything else.
[12:24.39]I sold the fucking adventure bomb.
[12:27.59]The ghostly figure lifts and she begins to rise into the air.
[12:32.11]Okay.
[12:34.43]Wish I could use that fucking ghost bomb right now.
[12:44.57]This is the ultimate babysitter challenge.
[12:48.07]Oswald's lover is a wraith.
[12:49.31]Wraiths can drain life with an unavoidable spell.
[12:51.65]Attack them quickly to stop it.
[13:05.08]Oswald, you just gotta... Oh, shit!
[13:06.92]In my diaper.
[13:07.60]Woo-hoo-hoo!
[13:09.84]Just stay... Just Oswald burger boy technique.
[13:11.50]Just stay alive.
[13:12.76]Game over.
[13:13.06]I win.
[13:22.90]Where is he?
[13:24.26]Where is he?
[13:35.69]Give me it.
[13:36.03]I win.
[13:38.41]Burger boy technique all the way.
[13:39.79]Like, in a situation like that, when you're up against the wall in a bad situation, burger boy fucking technique.
[13:49.02]He's alive.
[13:52.07]Oswin kneels over the body of the wraith and begins to weep.
[13:55.78]As a soft rain falls on the village square, you quietly leave the man to his grief.
[14:01.22]I win.
[14:03.10]I gold medaled the lovers.
[14:06.48]Hooray.
[14:07.28]A tale of love concludes with death, as they ever do.
[14:14.32]Let's all go outside and eat a beehive.
[14:19.28]Fetid Fens, Exploding Doodads, Goblin Retainer, and the Road to Goblin Town.
[14:27.63]For saving Oswin, I get the Holy Bomb, the Friend Bomb, New Vial, Dark Thirst, Blinding Brew.
[14:38.91]Okay.
[14:41.02]For your benevolence in battle, your supplies have been added to.
[14:44.02]Healing Spirits.
[14:46.80]We have to go to Goblin Town.
[14:47.86]That sounds like the most fun.
[14:53.86]I think I have unlocked any new... I really can't.
[15:03.93]I don't want to go back to this one now.
[15:06.77]This one is just the curse.
[15:09.58]But I do have to pee.
[15:12.00]So give me one moment.
[15:14.54]I'll take a break.
[15:15.08]I'll be back in Lickety Split.
[15:19.36]See you guys in a minute.
[15:21.16]Pee time.
[15:43.70]Thank you.
[16:30.66]So,
[17:38.39]Hello Well, we had some bits come in here First of all Ben
[17:50.53]Billionaire Ben.
[17:53.15]Ben B, Ben Billionaire.
[17:55.91]50 bucks.
[17:57.61]Continuing his massive amount of payments.
[18:02.77]His bank account is full of cash.
[18:07.86]And he has spoiled the absolute shit out of me.
[18:12.76]What is your total?
[18:13.74]I'm just curious, Ben.
[18:14.68]What's your total at this point?
[18:16.62]You've got to be up past...
[18:18.72]You're in, like, the thousands of dollars at this point.
[18:20.60]You have, you have, like, the, you have, like, the, you have the 1,000 air badge, right?
[18:26.96]You are way too kind, man.
[18:32.08]I have 27 cents on my debit card.
[18:34.91]I remember living that life.
[18:40.51]But, thank you so much, dude.
[18:44.61]Oh, for a billion, he's at a billion dollars.
[18:48.68]Imagine if somebody was that rich.
[18:51.54]I'm going to donate like $500 million to this Twitch streamer guy.
[18:56.76]It's well over $2,000.
[18:58.06]Damn.
[18:59.28]Damn.
[19:00.53]Two grand.
[19:01.97]Well over $2,000.
[19:02.47]Well, thank you so much, dude.
[19:08.43]You are single-handedly... You single-handedly bought me a car.
[19:13.41]I'm going to go buy a car now.
[19:17.07]Much appreciated, dude.
[19:20.40]Moose Man also just came in.
[19:24.96]You're my boy.
[19:25.56]Well, thank you, Ben.
[19:27.60]You are also.
[19:29.92]You're my boy.
[19:31.86]He's my baby boy.
[19:32.89]He's my baby boy.
[19:36.23]But Moose Man, thank you for the $4.70.
[19:37.21]$4.70.
[19:37.23]I met this guy named Dan from Boston.
[19:47.48]He'd like to chase girls and sleep on grass.
[19:51.84]Do I know him?
[19:54.98]I have no idea who that is.
[19:58.56]I don't know who that is.
[19:59.24]I'm sure it's probably some meme or something.
[20:02.08]I don't know.
[20:03.36]But, no.
[20:05.47]Thank you, though, Mooseman.
[20:07.75]Gunther, thank you for the $1.
[20:09.27]Wonderful babysitting.
[20:10.19]Also, Osmond for zero stat character in Gerber Rumble, please.
[20:13.39]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[20:15.13]I'm sure we'll have at least a few characters from here that would go in the next one.
[20:20.86]Oswin will potentially be one of them, I would assume.
[20:23.38]Because he was just too stupid.
[20:27.08]But Ben again, Ben again earlier gave $25 and says, Auntie Dickies.
[20:34.57]Hashtag Auntie Dickies.
[20:37.19]Thanks for the $75 there, Ben.
[20:39.23]Appreciate it, dude.
[20:42.76]Christmas Mania Rumble?
[20:43.76]Yeah, I probably... I'm sure I'll do that.
[20:47.93]Yeah.
[20:48.71]We'll do that.
[20:49.27]That'll be probably what the next one is.
[20:50.37]Because I like to spread them out, like, maybe once every, um... Like, once every, like, four or five months.
[20:56.97]Something like that.
[20:57.77]Every, like, every two or three a year, I'd say.
[21:00.14]Like, maybe one every quarter would make the most sense.
[21:03.42]But remember, I want to have, like, new characters.
[21:06.22]I don't want to just have it be the same people you've seen.
[21:08.08]I want to have it be new every time.
[21:09.64]New characters.
[21:11.44]It's, like, more fun that way.
[21:14.42]We'll see if there's enough new people that I could make in December.
[21:18.40]We'll see.
[21:20.66]But, uh, thank you.
[21:22.78]Also, Gaming Trickster gave $1.
[21:26.52]Thanks a lot, dude.
[21:28.18]Uh, Yumi... Uh, Yumi Suki with $10 said earlier that I unplugged my internet when the stream crashed.
[21:37.34]Uh, I didn't.
[21:39.17]I promise.
[21:40.49]But, thank you so much, Yumi, for the $10.
[21:45.14]And then... Animus, again, for a dollar.
[21:51.66]Minus five food if I don't cheer.
[21:55.57]Well, you've already locked yourself in on that one.
[21:58.69]But thanks for the one dollar, dude.
[21:59.71]Also, Reaper, 500.
[22:00.83]Thanks for the five bucks.
[22:01.49]Do you remember, if you fail this, don't do it again.
[22:05.51]The lover's mission is like babysitting your neighbor's kid who likes the rat poison.
[22:09.46]Jesus Christ.
[22:15.03]Well, I beat it, so we're good.
[22:17.47]Stix Renegade.
[22:18.37]Stix, thanks for the $1.26.
[22:20.19]Hey, German, just want to say if you need us, let us know.
[22:22.67]We're going to be around.
[22:24.03]I mean, we have no place to go.
[22:25.73]If you're feeling down all low when the pretty birds have flown, honey, I'm still there.
[22:31.06]Take a chance on me.
[22:35.22]Thank you, Animus, again for the $1 decoy streamer.
[22:38.64]And I think that catches us up.
[22:42.02]But thanks a lot, guys.
[22:43.83]And then right now, literally two minutes ago, Yumi again with $5.
[22:49.63]No, I don't like to eat on camera.
[22:56.29]I find it, like, strange.
[22:57.35]I find it odd.
[23:00.55]I don't like it.
[23:01.81]I don't like when people watch me eat.
[23:03.68]Because all I think about is, like, thousands of people.
[23:07.14]Like, for instance, right now, like, before the stream died, there was, what, 20, like, 2,100, 2,200 people here at one point?
[23:14.25]If there were 2,200 people sitting in a room watching me eat a hamburger, I would be like, I'd be like kind of cringed up and, what the fuck is going on?
[23:24.23]Leave me alone.
[23:25.51]Don't look at me.
[23:27.35]I'm a don't look at me eater.
[23:29.45]Even when I go to restaurants with friends or like my girlfriend, I'm a don't look at me eater.
[23:35.30]I don't like, you know, when somebody makes eye contact with you when you're at a restaurant, and you take a big bite of your sandwich and you're hungry, you always eat differently.
[23:44.33]I eat differently at a restaurant because I know everyone's looking at me.
[23:47.79]The person across the table, the waitress, the waiter, the cook is peering over the edge to see what's going on.
[23:54.11]You very, very cowardly eat food when you're in a restaurant when you like that.
[23:59.16]When I'm by myself and no one is watching, I eat like a fucking bird.
[24:05.90]I stuff food down my throat.
[24:07.60]I stuff it in and chew it.
[24:11.18]It gets all over my mouth and stuff.
[24:15.59]Eating alone is so much better than eating with other people.
[24:17.35]It just is.
[24:17.69]Alright, let's do... Okay, the wheel.
[24:22.29]The wheel seems interesting, but it's really far ahead.
[24:27.74]No, we're gonna try we're gonna do the chariot the symbol of victory over oppression control and will Properties, I understand sweet d and you will learn Hey, thank you.
[24:39.97]Hey, definitely for the one dollar eat a kid cuisine on stream This shit is gross
[24:45.48]Don't... Kid Cuisine, that's... I swear to God, they made every Kid Cuisine frozen dinner 17 years ago.
[24:53.98]Or like 20 years ago.
[24:55.41]And they haven't made any more.
[24:56.41]They just made like 500,000 of them.
[24:58.21]And they froze them in a cryogenic chamber forever.
[25:04.22]Let's go with... The Chariot seems to be...
[25:08.19]Lots of campfires.
[25:10.08]Lots of... What the hell is that on the top?
[25:12.10]Okay, there's lots of metronomes.
[25:15.26]And lots of artifacts.
[25:17.88]I don't really have anybody.
[25:19.04]Defeat strength, defeat the chariot to unlock.
[25:21.00]Okay, so I get a new companion here.
[25:26.65]So, we're going to go with the wanderer.
[25:32.83]Just because.
[25:33.51]Okay, here we go.
[25:35.03]The road to Goblin Town, obviously.
[25:36.51]Obviously.
[25:38.37]He's in the group now, so we'll do the Shaman.
[25:40.84]A Winding Trail, Fetid Fens, Goblin Retainer.
[25:45.62]We have to win that.
[25:49.54]I don't know how to get this.
[25:54.16]We'll take this just in case I want to do it.
[25:57.63]And that's it for the new cards and some of the old ones.
[26:02.79]This one is a Knockdown Thieves Light and it gives... What's the token for this?
[26:09.51]Kill 15 thieves with a finisher to unlock this token.
[26:14.95]What's going to be here?
[26:16.27]I don't know.
[26:18.11]Dark Thirst?
[26:20.23]No, let's take a look.
[26:22.14]Don't know yet.
[26:22.64]That's fine.
[26:23.88]Winter's Bane.
[26:26.74]Valiant Aegis.
[26:27.70]Blinding Brew.
[26:30.22]Just want to be able to see what these are at this point.
[26:33.22]It's interesting.
[26:34.16]The Gambler's Jewel.
[26:35.51]We've still haven't seen the Ruby Ring.
[26:46.91]Mmm... That's alright.
[26:52.42]Take three, five food, and let's start with... Um... Well, I don't even know what these are, so I'm going to take them and use them.
[27:05.98]Alright.
[27:06.84]A plague of corruption is spreading through the downtrodden denizens in the Old City.
[27:11.65]Aid Estrella and her loyal soldiers and find a way for the citizens to escape.
[27:16.78]Infestation.
[27:17.46]Defeat as many corrupted as possible to find the source of the plague.
[27:21.04]You will need to demonstrate great precision in order to win the day.
[27:24.70]And save innocent townsfolk to access more stock and options at camp.
[27:30.23]Cool.
[27:32.81]So, I don't have any of the Hellsmith precision, but... Don't I have, like, a curse?
[27:37.13]Isn't there a... Whatever, let's just go.
[27:40.68]Let's go.
[27:42.19]The Chariot.
[27:43.71]This game, I believe, is under $30.
[27:44.83]$27, I think.
[27:45.03]I'm not going to eat a Kid Cuisine on stream.
[27:46.59]You can eat... Can't you eat Kid Cuisine frozen and it doesn't even matter?
[27:50.65]It's just food bricks.
[27:52.17]That's all it is.
[28:12.03]You could buy a hundred kid cuisines and keep them in the freezer and lose access to gas and electric and just eat those rock-hard chicken nuggets forever.
[28:26.78]Alright, here we go.
[28:27.62]We gotta get into character mode here.
[28:31.60]City in Peril.
[28:33.77]Sir Malifau looks down from the back of his steed at the soldiers lined rank and file before him.
[28:41.24]The city is lost to the plague.
[28:44.02]We will not waste another soldier on this place.
[28:47.36]He gives the final command.
[28:49.18]In the name of the Emperor, prepare to withdraw.
[28:52.59]Block the gatehouses.
[28:54.11]Let no one through.
[28:55.87]At sunrise, burn the city to the ground.
[29:00.01]Without hesitation, the soldiers march down the cobbled street toward the western gatehouse.
[29:04.39]A single soldier remains, a captain.
[29:07.29]She removes her helm to reveal a
[29:10.98]A quiff of... A quiff... A quiff of golden hair.
[29:19.38]I bet.
[29:31.65]She removes her helmet to reveal... Alright, whatever.
[29:37.29]Let's move on.
[29:39.35]A golden hair and an eye patch concealing a wound from a battle long ago.
[29:43.47]She approaches you and Colby.
[29:46.35]I know how to read English.
[29:47.51]I just almost said that and then I read the sentence before it and it starts making me laugh.
[29:54.82]Many innocent people will die come morning if nothing is done to correct this injustice.
[30:00.18]I ask that you aid my men in their search for citizens to escort out of the old city.
[30:04.80]Hurry.
[30:05.84]Nightfall fast approaches.
[30:08.89]Find and rescue citizens and escort them out of the city.
[30:11.07]Let's ask a couple of questions.
[30:15.76]Ask about the plan.
[30:21.49]What's going on with the plague here?
[30:24.13]A terrible tragedy to be sure.
[30:26.21]While the Empire's eye is on the northern border, it has abandoned its people to this unnatural plague.
[30:32.22]Do not be fooled.
[30:33.64]This is no ordinary m'lady.
[30:36.14]Its affliction mends and warps the minds of those it corrupts, turning friend, family, or lover into a mindless agent of hate and aggression.
[30:48.61]The...
[30:51.88]The Empire is right to fear its rapid spread and potential reach.
[30:55.66]However, there are many who call the city home, who have not been damned, not yet.
[31:02.12]It is these souls I intend to save this night.
[31:11.63]Ask about the plan.
[31:14.36]I anticipated Malifaux's intentions, and my scouts have made preparations.
[31:18.38]To the southwest is a gatehouse, abandoned when the infected broke through.
[31:22.56]If we can clear the corrupted from this district, we can escort any citizens through with minimal resistance.
[31:30.16]Ask about her.
[31:37.32]Oh my god.
[31:38.28]What have I done?
[31:45.82]I hate this.
[31:48.08]Oh, I hate this.
[31:49.96]Oh my god.
[31:50.62]Okay, let's go.
[31:53.82]I need to get away from this person before I lose my mind.
[31:57.39]Defeat blight monster cards to access the gatehouse.
[32:00.77]And there are 60 people to save.
[32:04.61]Ask about her kid.
[32:05.51]What do you think about kid cuisine?
[32:07.99]My coachmen will follow and transport any citizens you might find along the way.
[32:12.21]If you are lucky, they may be of assistance in your travels.
[32:16.16]Search the streets.
[32:17.04]Kill the infected.
[32:18.42]I will send word when they are ready to go.
[32:22.50]Save citizens will add options at the campfire.
[32:26.97]You got it.
[32:30.07]So city streets are city streets.
[32:32.13]Let's go over here.
[32:33.83]Everywhere the rot touches, everywhere bears its stains.
[32:40.54]Fucking A. God damn it.
[32:43.42]I'm never going to get over this, am I?
[32:47.70]Tall buildings line the streets, their lower windows boarded up with planks of wood on imperial order.
[32:53.92]A futile attempt to hinder the spread of the plague.
[32:57.58]What are you sacrificing when you stop to help them?
[33:00.42]Have you asked yourself that?
[33:02.82]You happen upon a group of frightened peasants desperately seeking safety.
[33:08.31]We hear the Empire has abandoned the city.
[33:11.29]Please help us!
[33:13.31]You explain Captain Fiore's plan and help them on the wagons.
[33:16.63]You have saved eight citizens.
[33:19.31]We are grateful!
[33:20.93]A woman says as she steps into the carriage.
[33:23.74]I haven't much food, but should you need some, I would be willing to trade.
[33:29.11]More food is available at the campfire.
[33:31.05]From this street, you can see other paths.
[33:32.73]Okay, winding trail, city streets.
[33:39.33]Let's try to just save as many people as possible, right?
[33:43.39]You dash through the labyrinth of slum streets in the city center.
[33:47.70]Surgery must be done with precision if it is to be effective.
[33:52.57]You find yourself surrounded by the corrupted horde that broke through the gatehouse and wandered into the district.
[33:58.08]They shuffle mindlessly back and forth on the spot, limbs twitching, seemingly unaware of your presence.
[34:04.72]Ambush the corrupted.
[34:08.77]This is why I needed to do this.
[34:11.79]They don't call me Stacker Champion for nothing.
[34:17.43]Maybe if I were to shut up and be quiet, I would have been able to do that.
[34:43.93]Somebody came in and just broke my neck.
[34:46.26]That's what happened.
[34:46.78]It was like... It's alright.
[34:52.06]I got dual butcher's blades.
[34:59.64]Brigand's blades.
[35:00.57]A sharp knife quickly applied under cover of night has long been the tool of footpads and criminals.
[35:07.29]Criminals.
[35:08.19]Wow, there's a lot of people here.
[35:14.96]Oh, plenty of people just spam.
[35:30.29]Oh, the unspeakable corruption.
[35:35.45]Oh, that was quick.
[35:36.17]Uh, he's almost dead.
[35:38.69]Only one person is dead.
[35:48.73]Well, he instantly gets resurrected, that's a good thing.
[35:52.50]Come on, come on!
[35:56.74]Again!
[35:58.50]Again!
[35:59.52]No whack!
[36:19.36]Stay away.
[36:22.38]Over the balconies.
[36:23.04]Throw him over there.
[36:23.62]Good.
[36:24.14]Good for you.
[36:24.64]You did a great job, buddy.
[36:28.68]Okay, we're good.
[36:32.88]I didn't even need to say anything.
[36:33.78]Right off the bat, we got three food from chat.
[36:36.00]Thanks, guys.
[36:37.26]You guys fucking rock.
[36:38.84]Thank you.
[36:42.86]That appears to be the last of them, Kobe remarks.
[36:46.67]You continue to journey through the winding streets.
[36:48.65]You gain four fame.
[36:49.47]From this street you can see other paths.
[36:51.55]So I have to get rid of... to save everybody.
[36:57.13]The shaman... I mean, I'm gonna get food here.
[37:02.91]Let's do his little shaman expedition.
[37:04.71]Why not?
[37:07.77]Got three free food.
[37:10.33]Shamans.
[37:11.53]They are like mages, but they believe otherwise.
[37:15.24]The shamans of the north are known as healers, raid leaders, and curse bringers, among other things.
[37:20.18]She stares warily as you approach, but relaxes at the sight of Kolbjorn.
[37:26.72]Hmm.
[37:27.80]Clan.
[37:28.68]Clan.
[37:29.48]Clan.
[37:30.39]Clan.
[37:30.95]Clan.
[37:32.33]Clan Eyebride Fada and one of the Eastern Belt.
[37:38.35]I have only spilled your people's blood.
[37:41.53]I have yet to see one up close.
[37:44.35]Do you find it hard to move with bones so weak?
[37:49.45]Hope Euron drops a blessing at the door when the shaman allows him to enter.
[37:52.06]Well, bye.
[37:56.84]I hope you had fun doing that, because we can't do it anymore.
[38:03.02]The Pauper district has been hit by looters leaving shops with broken windows and empty shelves.
[38:09.02]Grateful hero.
[38:11.86]The unmistakable sound of combat alerts you to a group of townsfolk being attacked by the infected.
[38:18.08]One brave warrior struggles to hold back the horde.
[38:20.56]You rush to their aid.
[38:29.23]Thank you, Lactose Cow, for the $5.
[38:31.85]Any interest in playing Hive Swap?
[38:33.47]It's a text-based adventure set in the 90s and it's really funny and has pogs.
[38:38.98]Well, um, I'm not against, like, I pretty much compare everything to Sorcery, which is bad.
[38:46.34]Because Sorcery is like the top of the line, best thing ever.
[38:50.24]So, it's kind of like, um, it's kind of like when an open world Grand Theft Auto clone comes out.
[38:56.36]Like, when Watch Dogs 2 came out, it was, oh, this is Watch Dogs 2.
[39:01.95]It's just a terrible GTA vibe.
[39:04.87]I hold everything to the standard of that GTA V, which is, like, so sweet.
[39:08.95]Alright.
[39:13.49]Oh, sorry.
[39:14.31]If anyone, like, likes that game, like, sorry.
[39:15.97]I just, like, hated it.
[39:17.50]I said it was dumb.
[39:18.36]Whoops.
[39:18.78]I'm sorry.
[39:19.16]No, it's not dumb.
[39:19.74]It was alright.
[39:20.86]What?
[39:29.82]Forget I said that.
[39:36.57]It's never gonna end.
[39:39.11]Watchdog 2 was not even bad though.
[39:40.85]I'm just like, I'm obviously just kidding, but... Am I?
[39:47.74]Ben Elnor, Ben with another $25, says, We ain't add nothing but mega a bread.
[39:53.28]Gonna have to start the chant in a minute here then.
[39:59.16]Ben, Ben, Ben Lillionaire,
[40:02.78]Benillionaire.
[40:03.92]Benillionaire.
[40:05.64]Benillionaire.
[40:06.50]Your name always is Billionaire.
[40:07.64]Benillionaire.
[40:09.02]Thanks, dude.
[40:11.10]Also, thank you to Yumi again for the $5.
[40:13.84]Do a Kid Cuisine vs Lunchables taste test.
[40:18.74]I can save you guys some trouble.
[40:20.36]They're both disgusting.
[40:24.31]One just is cut into funny shapes.
[40:27.05]The other one is rotten chicken nuggets.
[40:29.09]They're both gross.
[40:29.61]I don't need to do a taste test.
[40:30.77]They're both going to be a zero.
[40:33.54]You can't divide, you can't times or divide anything by zero.
[40:36.31]Zero times anything is zero.
[40:37.75]Still zero.
[40:42.73]But, thank you for the $5.
[40:45.41]A whole of one zombie, thanks for the $15.
[40:47.23]Hey, turned 30 today.
[40:50.61]Just thought I'd say thanks for making the last year more bearable.
[40:53.07]Hasn't been the best.
[40:54.59]That said, I've cried with laughter at your streams, and as with many of your viewers, it certainly makes life a lot easier to deal with.
[41:01.50]All the best, buddy.
[41:03.12]Well, zombie.
[41:05.20]All the best to you, too.
[41:08.70]I'm also above that dreaded 30 age.
[41:10.36]With 30 brothers.
[41:10.88]But, yeah.
[41:19.77]I just like to have fun, guys.
[41:21.13]I just want to enjoy hanging out, have fun.
[41:24.51]Tomorrow is going to be one of those streams that is just going to be like a fun stream.
[41:30.63]And I look forward to this shit each and every fucking day.
[41:36.25]Trying to find out more ways to hang out with you guys, more interesting, fun things to do.
[41:41.89]That's the most important thing.
[41:44.19]So, if you're here and it's helping you somehow, again,
[41:50.49]like that's so fucking humbling to hear that and hopefully we can continue to do it so much love to you all but thank you zombie happy uh happy 30th birthday how old is chat I don't know how I would say like chat is probably I'm gonna say on average like 41
[42:18.61]41 or 44 is the average.
[42:21.63]A lot of old fucking people on this website.
[42:23.87]Like, over 50 that you guys don't know.
[42:26.01]Like, my father uses this website.
[42:31.47]Yeah, my, like, dad.
[42:34.20]He's, like, 78.
[42:34.56]You know how many dads you... Okay.
[42:40.70]Dude, this Twitch staff in here right now... Twitch staff.
[42:44.20]God.
[42:45.84]How many people on Twitch...
[42:48.87]Do you have, like, listed?
[42:50.47]You can pull up the analytics right now.
[42:52.25]They are at the computer.
[42:53.86]How many people logged in right now over the age of 51?
[43:00.10]He's going to come back.
[43:00.70]It's going to be like 67%.
[43:03.96]I would assume.
[43:06.60]But anyways, let's keep going.
[43:10.76]In this chat?
[43:13.21]Oh, God, no.
[43:14.89]We're data mining.
[43:16.11]Yeah, Nordic, we're data mining.
[43:20.58]Uh, anyways.
[43:24.58]You arrived just in time!
[43:26.70]I don't think I could have held them off from my... I could part with some equipment.
[43:33.45]I don't think it will do much good now.
[43:35.19]See me if you're interested in a trade.
[43:38.19]You've saved five citizens.
[43:39.65]More equipment is available to purchase at the campfire.
[43:43.45]I can't give specifics, but less than one percent.
[43:51.65]I'm the only one.
[43:52.55]Alright, think about that.
[43:54.60]If there are, like, 1,700 people here right now, that means I might be one of the only people that's, like, over the age of 30.
[44:01.50]What the fuck?
[44:08.78]Alright, you explained Captain Fiore's plan and helped the survivors onto the wagons.
[44:12.46]Let's keep moving.
[44:14.31]Still need to save citizens.
[44:16.05]The stench of corruption flows across the cities, tainting everything it touches.
[44:21.55]We bring word from Captain Fiore, the soldier explains with a salute.
[44:25.13]The infected horde at the next gatehouse has subsided.
[44:28.44]The dealer removes the corruption counter from the map.
[44:31.22]Okay, so that's cool.
[44:33.24]But there is a problem.
[44:34.94]Corruption grows from the ground itself, blocking all passage for the wagons.
[44:39.50]It must be destroyed.
[44:41.86]She asks that we join you in your efforts.
[44:44.92]Should you require our assistance, you need only ask.
[44:51.22]Astralis Allegiance!
[44:52.52]Prior to combat, optional draw an Empire Ally card.
[44:55.15]And then discard this card.
[45:08.68]You got it.
[45:10.58]Burp?
[45:10.78]What do you mean, burp?
[45:11.38]What are you talking about?
[45:14.52]That wasn't a burp.
[45:16.75]That was my knuckles cracking.
[45:20.53]Okay, so it's blocked, right?
[45:25.25]No, it's not.
[45:26.15]I want to go to the left here.
[45:27.43]City streets.
[45:27.91]No, I'm going to go right.
[45:31.92]That was a belt.
[45:32.52]No, that was my knuckles cracking.
[45:36.64]Look, I'll do it again.
[45:41.77]See?
[45:41.85]See?
[45:43.67]The pauper district has been hit by looters leaving shops with broken windows and empty shelves.
[45:49.59]There's more corrupted here.
[45:52.13]Ambush the corrupt.
[45:55.68]Don't even think.
[45:56.96]Oh my god damn it.
[46:00.44]I'm overthinking it.
[46:01.32]Stop overthinking and just do it.
[46:02.40]Come on, get it.
[46:02.96]I know I can get it.
[46:03.89]Just do it.
[46:17.33]Let's fight them, okay?
[46:18.51]No, I don't want... I don't want to do that.
[46:21.66]No, don't call any assistance.
[46:28.40]Have I actually gotten the pendulum?
[46:29.95]I got the gold pretty reliably last night.
[46:33.37]That's a lot of people, though.
[46:45.99]Just bounce him around.
[46:47.29]There's a guy that's killable over there.
[46:54.23]Not anymore.
[46:56.41]I'm not even sure I want to do the executions.
[46:58.05]I feel like it leaves you open.
[46:59.01]Unless you're like far enough away.
[47:06.23]See?
[47:08.01]A little awkward.
[47:15.56]Well, he's back.
[47:19.62]Of all the companions so far, this guy might be worse than Oswin.
[47:28.64]This guy has died more times in one fight than I think that Oswin has been kidnapped.
[47:42.57]I got it one time?
[47:43.25]No, I got it like three times last night.
[47:47.01]I got at least two or three times last night.
[47:53.98]Bold claim, because Osman sucks.
[48:04.46]We got money.
[48:06.18]We got money coming in here.
[48:07.20]Trinzy!
[48:07.76]Trinzy with $100.

[49:58.68]It was originally serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump for transfer to the Monthly Magazine.
[50:04.06]So it was in that magazine.
[50:05.70]And it's on Crunch.
[50:07.06]I'm not going to say.

[51:56.00]Give us all your gold or die.
[51:57.92]Attack the cowardly band for daring to threaten you.
[52:00.52]You prepare for combat.
[52:02.96]We don't need anybody.
[52:04.58]We're good.
[52:13.45]Yumi, thank you, Yumi, again for the $15.
[52:14.89]In all seriousness, you've helped me through some bad times, mostly with your YouTube videos.
[52:21.29]Keep enjoying what you're doing and bringing joy to thousands while you're doing it.
[52:25.07]I don't usually chat- I don't usually catch your streams, so it was a treat to be here.
[52:28.27]Well, it's a treat for you to be here.
[52:30.89]Thank you so much for sticking around.
[52:33.61]YouTube is gonna... Look like- like- like an old- like an old oiled machine.
[52:39.20]It's in like the du- the dust- my like lawnmower is in- is in the shop right now, kind of collecting dust in the back, and it's- it's covered in fucking grease and oil and shit.
[52:48.74]It's in the shop right now.
[52:50.04]I called somebody to- to repair my lawnmower.
[52:54.62]And sooner or later that lawnmower is going to be full of life.
[52:57.72]It's going to have brand new rims on it.
[53:01.12]The blade is going to put three triple blades in there so it cuts the grass at three separate lengths and fades it like a haircut.
[53:08.92]It's going to be awesome.
[53:12.24]Thank you so much for your extremely kind words.
[53:20.60]And your bits.
[53:23.64]That's very nice of you.
[53:26.63]Anyways, more just came in.
[53:32.35]Trisney gave another $15.
[53:37.84]Your response and chat response to my bits made my entire year.
[53:41.64]JoJo's is an anime where big buff dudes fight.
[53:45.78]I suggest watching it.
[53:47.74]Well, maybe I'll give it an episode.
[53:49.83]Maybe I'll take a look at one episode.
[53:52.39]At times 25 speed.
[53:56.77]So then I could watch the whole thing.
[53:58.13]And why don't we do that?
[53:58.73]Why don't we do that with more TV, by the way?
[54:01.58]You know, I was like, oh man, I really would love to marathon Breaking Bad, but each episode is like fucking 45 minutes.
[54:07.66]No, just watch it like times 30 speed.
[54:10.26]You can still kind of... Here, look, let me... I'll give you an example.
[54:13.79]Look.
[54:15.91]Just give me one second.
[54:16.67]This is like what I'm talking about.
[54:17.69]I'll be right back.
[54:20.77]This is important because we want to talk about this.
[54:23.05]Give me one minute.
[56:37.69]So, for instance, right?
[56:39.57]If we were to watch one episode of Breaking Bad, like I said, I just have to record this just quickly.
[56:46.43]This is what I'm talking about.
[56:48.34]Let's watch Breaking Bad.
[56:49.86]Listen to me, Jesse.
[56:51.20]Jesse, you need to cook.
[56:53.24]We have to find a way to get past the security guard, Jesse.
[56:56.62]And by the way, also important to know that I am the leader of the Heisenberg movement, Jesse.
[57:03.49]Man, I don't know.
[57:04.81]That's kind of stupid, man.
[57:06.83]I'm kind of curious about some things like a cat, man.
[57:10.32]Jesse, listen to me.
[57:11.56]There's no reason why you need to be scared of that bad guy at the counter.
[57:16.20]Man, I'm a man, man.
[57:18.84]I'm also in this show, and I'm the mean lady that's your wife.
[57:24.91]So let's just pretend that's an episode.
[57:27.51]So if we were to watch that at times like 100 speed, you'd save about like 40 minutes.
[57:33.81]Well, you'd save like 20 to 30 minutes.
[57:36.10]We just saved like 20 seconds.
[57:37.44]You know what I mean?
[57:54.59]Why don't we watch more TV shows like this?
[57:56.23]If you have to marathon a show and you like want to catch up, oh, I got to catch up on Mr. Robot.
[58:00.73]Do that.
[58:01.57]You could still understand what was going on.
[58:03.59]You just like lightning downloaded into your eyes.
[58:15.12]I wasn't trying to make it like a joke there.
[58:16.74]I was trying to make like a point.
[58:21.06]That wasn't, I wasn't like making a joke.
[58:27.19]What was I doing?
[58:28.75]I'm fighting bandits.
[58:47.34]Catch up on the 6,000 hour movie.
[58:52.08]The stream is bizarre.
[58:53.82]Kind of like a JoJo's Adventure Band.
[58:59.36]I'm fucking sorry.
[59:03.51]Uh, anyways, I got, like, I lost a lot of fucking track.
[59:13.32]God, shut up.
[59:14.10]Come on.
[59:14.56]Give me that one.
[59:16.33]Give me that one.
[59:17.43]Don't give me the ha-ha bullshit.
[59:19.41]Like, we were just making a fucking reference to that show.
[59:22.55]And I read something in chat that said that was a meatball.
[59:27.47]That's not a ha-ha.
[59:28.75]That's a meatball.
[59:34.77]Good one, man.
[59:37.83]Listen, Jesse.
[59:39.67]Anyways, I keep getting fucking my brain needs to slow down for a second.
[59:47.62]Uh, first of all.
[59:49.94]Shit.
[59:56.38]I, like, lost track.
[59:57.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[60:00.67]Thank you.
[60:01.23]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much to Trisney.
[60:04.27]Uh, Trinsy.
[60:05.25]Yumisuki.
[60:08.79]Uh, hey, Diffney, thanks for the bits.
[60:11.33]I, like, this is where I am.
[60:16.40]Uh... Kale Gannon, thanks for the $1.
[60:17.66]Did you get a chance to look at PsyOps?
[60:19.80]Love you, son.
[60:20.54]I did not.
[60:21.18]Not yet.
[60:21.46]Thanks for reminding me, though.
[60:24.13]Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[60:25.35]German Jojo is a fantastic show and holds a special place in my heart.
[60:29.65]I'm gonna have to watch it, then.
[60:31.05]Ben, thanks for another $50 fucking dollars.
[60:35.57]And you say, bring back Ren and Stimpy.
[60:38.53]Uh, no, I disagree.
[60:40.07]Because they brought it back and it was stupid.
[60:41.61]It was terrible.
[60:42.94]They made, like, the Brennan Stimpy adult party cartoon show.
[60:46.46]On adult, whatever, what was it?
[60:47.60]Adult Swim?
[60:48.14]It was awful.
[60:49.62]They were, like, trying so hard to be, like, edgy and overly sexual.
[60:53.55]It was fucking terrible.
[60:56.05]It was so much better when they didn't, like, it wasn't, like, the adult party cartoon show.
[61:05.28]But yes, old school Ren and Snippy is fantastic.
[61:11.84]Yeah, they brought it back like 10 years ago now.
[61:14.96]They brought it back for like, I don't know, like a season, a few episodes, whatever it was.
[61:18.00]It was a disaster.
[61:20.68]But thank you, Ben, for the 50 additional dollars.
[61:26.07]Let's go.
[61:26.57]Okay, let's continue.
[61:30.59]With the coward subdued, the thugs plead for their lives.
[61:34.52]Please, for pity's sake.
[61:35.84]We only want to feed our families.
[61:37.28]What else would you have us do?
[61:42.06]Demand they give you their spoils.
[61:43.80]Yeah, give me all your stuff.
[61:45.72]Reluctantly, the bandits hand over their spoils.
[61:51.73]Well, I think I want these.
[61:55.23]But from a flurry of strikes that cause a knockdown against thieves.
[62:00.79]Or, I mean, I feel like, yeah.
[62:03.19]Corrupted, right?
[62:06.95]Let's get the Bastion.
[62:13.56]And we got 10 gold.
[62:20.42]Uh-huh.
[62:20.96]Yep.
[62:21.82]City streets.
[62:23.15]Signs of mass departure are everywhere.
[62:25.05]Homes stand empty.
[62:26.43]I still didn't get over the fact that people were ha-ha-ing me in this chat.
[62:31.31]Can we talk about that for a second?
[62:32.43]What was that for?
[62:35.48]I didn't... More than 10% of you dickies?
[62:38.37]Where are the anti-dickies?
[62:46.59]Signs of... Everything's crumbling.
[62:49.67]You pass through without incident.
[62:58.98]I love fucking around.
[62:59.82]You guys are like... I love just... This is why it's fun to do this.
[63:05.99]Well, there's the golden retriever right there.
[63:08.09]I can't determine whether you're the sort of person to put their faith in goblins.
[63:12.61]I've had too much coffee today, you're right.
[63:13.75]Or merely a sort to give their actions no thought.
[63:18.20]When I drink too much coffee, I turn into a fucking gremlin.
[63:20.60]You know in Gremlins 2 when Gizmo shoots out Daffy from his bat?
[63:27.33]Like, you don't feed me or give me coffee after midnight.
[63:32.81]Turn into the fucking green goblin.
[63:36.16]The tower is in chaos.
[63:37.36]Alarm bells have the garrison soldiers in a panic.
[63:41.02]As you watch, a goblin with a hefty sack leaps from a window, dangling from a makeshift rope.
[63:47.35]He bounces painfully off the wall as he lowers himself to the ground.
[63:51.21]The castle doors fly open.
[63:52.53]Guards assemble, armed and angered.
[63:55.93]The goblin blows his horn, discharging little more than a feeble hiss.
[64:01.82]I need a moment to recharge this.
[64:03.68]Help me and I'll split my takings.
[64:06.12]Before you can fly, he throws you an item from his sack.
[64:08.69]Here's your retainer.
[64:13.07]The guards rush forward.
[64:14.39]Arrest them.
[64:15.19]They're with the goblin.
[64:16.95]Light weapons are the weakest against Empire enemies.
[64:19.29]Let's just go ahead and see.
[64:23.53]No, I want to use these.
[64:24.31]What's the token?
[64:28.58]I'm going to keep it on.
[64:31.64]Goblin ain't going to die.
[64:35.22]That is in no way a goblin's voice.
[64:37.32]I phoned that one in.
[64:38.10]Yes, I did.
[64:41.32]Don't you guys understand?
[64:42.60]After I stream this game doing, like, full voice acting and reading it for, like, three to four hours, that's when I start to phone it in.
[64:51.44]That's the worst part about it.
[64:53.62]I'm phoning this shit.
[64:54.68]I gotta, like, step my game up.
[65:04.82]Um, am I missing something here?
[65:13.49]Yup.
[65:19.13]What?
[65:19.27]I didn't block that?
[65:19.91]Come on.
[65:25.18]Up and at him.
[65:34.80]Only an hour?
[65:35.46]No, I was streaming for like three hours before the ingest server went down.
[65:47.23]Hearing the shouts of additional guards, the goblin summons a portal and drags you in.
[65:51.92]The three of you fall through a seemingly endless tunnel of swirling stars.
[65:57.69]Oh, Lord.
[66:02.86]As long as I just don't get the pain card, I don't care, right?
[66:08.86]That's 20 gold.
[66:09.90]I'll take that.
[66:17.42]You see the goblin ahead, his sack tears open, and his loot tumbles toward you.
[66:23.38]Oh.
[66:24.15]After what seems a lifetime, the portal releases you in a forest.
[66:27.77]You find Colby passed out behind a shrub.
[66:30.73]You help him up and continue on your way.
[66:33.07]Your majestic disappearing act has become the talk of the town.
[66:35.38]So what do we got?
[66:37.86]City streets.
[66:38.96]Let's just keep going.
[66:42.28]Oh.
[66:43.30]Thanks, guys.
[66:45.52]Thanks for the money.
[66:50.22]I'm not paying any attention to the voting up there because it happens so infrequently that I just forget.
[66:55.41]Thanks for the free stuff.
[67:00.01]Buy food, free food, or free food.
[67:05.33]Arguably no reason for anyone to vote for the last one.
[67:12.54]Navigate the maze without incident.
[67:17.64]Alright, here we go.
[67:19.50]Everybody pay attention.
[67:21.80]Well, not yet.
[67:23.18]I'm running out of food, though.
[67:25.12]Good thing I'm going to get a nice supply drop.
[67:30.50]Grateful citizens, here we are.
[67:32.48]You happen upon a group of frightened peasants desperately seeking safety.
[67:36.40]We hear the emperor has abandoned the empire, has abandoned the city, they cry.
[67:39.98]Please help us.
[67:42.30]You explain Captain Fiore's plan and help them on the wagons.
[67:45.43]8 citizens.
[67:45.91]I'm assuming to get the gold for this, you need to get all 60.
[67:52.96]We're grateful.
[67:54.36]A woman says as she steps into the carriage that we haven't much food, but should you need some, I'd be willing to trade.
[68:00.74]I am getting to the point where I'll have food now.
[68:04.14]Okay, pay attention.
[68:07.80]Everybody pay attention.
[68:09.90]We have to get this right.
[68:12.18]No, this is not pay attention.
[68:13.48]I just have to
[68:16.64]I'll keep telling you guys this is for you, and it's for me.
[68:18.87]I just have to get the last one correct.
[68:25.85]Go into the building, save the person.
[68:27.87]Save her fifth husband now.
[68:29.73]Come on.
[68:30.03]That's good.
[68:39.82]Alright.
[68:42.86]Got the first two down.
[68:43.84]Just give me the last one.
[68:46.64]Excellent a wise decision Return to the building last time I'm trying to think of like I'm gonna like hit I'm gonna hypnotize myself Got it.
[69:05.71]Oh god.
[69:06.19]I got it.
[69:07.05]Yes.
[69:07.57]Thank God.
[69:08.01]Oh
[69:12.10]finally after putting this in the deck a dozen times I actually got it slumped in the corner of room you find the woman's husband you put his arm over your shoulder and quickly make your way out of the inferno as you emerge the woman and her children rush to the man's side and embrace him thank you adventurer you've saved my family from certain death I now can take this out of the deck
[69:37.03]While our possessions have been destroyed, and we will never be able to repay you, know that we will speak of your deeds here today for as long as we all shall live.
[69:47.88]Good.
[69:51.04]City streets.
[69:53.42]The pauper district has been lit by looters, broken windows, empty shelves.
[69:58.47]Maybe you should look to regain our strength at the wagon.
[70:01.43]As you make your way through the winding road, the peasants may have food to trade.
[70:04.31]Okay, so I've done everything.
[70:06.15]No, I have not.
[70:08.90]Do not take too long.
[70:10.86]Rescue wagons.
[70:11.58]The city falls around you.
[70:13.58]You approach the horse-drawn wagons.
[70:15.18]Captain Fiore's soldiers stand to attention and the head coachman tips the brim of his hood.
[70:20.84]We'll transport any people you find in these warrens.
[70:24.00]Just keep the wagon out of trouble.
[70:27.56]It's a trade.
[70:28.62]A lot of food.
[70:31.67]Oh boy.
[70:33.31]Let's buy it all up.
[70:37.94]I know you guys are gonna... I'm gonna get five from the voting here.
[70:42.44]But let's just get... Like, one more stockpile there.
[70:47.72]Get it to ten.
[70:50.08]And then equipment.
[70:51.20]Anybody have anything good?
[70:52.42]Dark Thirst.
[70:55.90]Perform a powerful strike that causes 200% damage on a single target.
[71:01.36]Requires less damage to cause knockdown to corrupted enemies.
[71:07.79]Uh, yes, I'm going to take this.
[71:11.45]He's too confident.
[71:12.89]C. Well, it doesn't matter what you do.
[71:16.21]You're going to help me.
[71:19.44]Let's go down.
[71:22.74]Signs of mass departure are everywhere.
[71:24.32]Homes stand empty.
[71:26.48]No new paths.
[71:28.20]So, thanks for the food.
[71:32.91]He's getting too cocky.
[71:34.19]We need to do something about it.
[71:37.66]Let's make our way to the gatehouse.
[71:45.25]It's a tough decision between taking $20 from me or giving me plus 10 max health.
[71:50.41]Yikes.
[72:09.81]It is as the scouts reported that corruption will block the path for the wagons.
[72:14.31]Now make haste.
[72:15.45]We'll protect the wagons with my scouts.
[72:17.52]You two clear the way.
[72:20.78]Let's go.
[72:22.20]You draw your weapon and prepare to face the infected.
[72:26.50]So this is five.
[72:29.94]I probably should call this in.
[72:31.68]Yeah.
[72:33.28]Let's get some scouts here.
[72:34.66]I think this is going to be a lot of people.
[72:48.68]Stop the dickies.
[72:50.52]New enemy?
[72:52.22]Corruption.
[72:52.72]Let's get rid of it.
[72:54.30]Oh, it's shielded.
[72:55.12]Whoo!
[73:17.63]Now that peasant died instantly.
[73:19.14]Let's actually get out of the swamp things.
[73:31.94]Take it off.
[73:37.46]Uh, nope.
[73:38.13]Can't dodge that.
[73:42.17]Whoa!
[73:45.68]I guess I have to evade that.
[73:47.14]Come here.
[73:48.10]Come here, guy that's always in trouble.
[73:50.40]Whoa.
[73:55.53]Take him out.
[74:13.32]Oh, shit.
[74:14.02]That's hard to avoid if you don't see the thing on the screen.
[74:21.54]We finally broke it off.
[74:22.50]Okay.
[74:25.70]Wait, that's it?
[74:26.32]Oh, you just have to break the shield.
[74:27.52]Okay.
[74:27.96]That makes more sense.
[74:36.25]Come here.
[74:37.05]Do your thing.
[74:50.61]Corruption cleansed Corruption cleansed again Fuck the challenge
[75:12.57]Oh, it looks like... It's close.
[75:17.79]It's alright, you can make it a challenge for me if you want.
[75:20.97]You can take some money away from me.
[75:23.72]I say that now and then I'm going to curse all of you.
[75:27.90]In about 15 minutes.
[75:32.46]Captain Fiore addresses you.
[75:35.26]You have a steady swing.
[75:36.58]Excellent soldier.
[75:38.00]It will only be more difficult from here on.
[75:40.68]I bear no ill will towards you if you choose to leave now.
[75:45.26]Leave the old city without the citizens.
[75:46.68]Continue to the next district.
[75:49.25]No.
[75:51.69]No, okay.
[75:52.07]Let's keep going.
[75:55.59]As the captain scouts lead the wagons through to the next district and seal the gates, you ascend the gatehouse tower.
[76:03.06]More citizens need to be saved.
[76:06.11]What is it the towers will watch over?
[76:08.81]A stream of death and despair?
[76:11.63]I gave you explicit permission to vote for B. I still don't think it's going to win.
[76:19.89]I am trying you guys at the moment.
[76:23.25]The tower provides a commanding view over the once impressive city.
[76:26.93]As you pause to catch your breath, you watch the last of the sun's rays disappear over the horizon.
[76:32.32]Kolbjorn shakes your shoulder and points over the battlements to the south.
[76:38.52]Final Refuge.
[76:42.42]There you see the final gatehouse, its tower rising from the wall of the old city to the south.
[76:47.22]The dealer adds a corruption counter to the map.
[76:52.88]That's a lot.
[76:54.78]40 corrupted, holy shit.
[76:57.96]Have you ever seen so many?
[76:59.87]Colbjorn remarks as you watch the infected swarm the city wall.
[77:03.71]How can the Empire let its people suffer so?
[77:06.95]And then abandon those in need?
[77:10.35]As you continue to look, a small glow appears on the horizon beyond the city perimeter.
[77:14.46]Perimeter?
[77:15.30]Perimeter?
[77:16.76]What the fuck?
[77:18.20]First one, then another, and another.
[77:20.34]The Empire!
[77:21.56]They are preparing to burn the city!
[77:23.72]We must get the people to safety!
[77:25.74]Let us hope we are not too late.
[77:29.97]Well, let's hope we're not too late.
[77:32.29]Get it.
[77:35.43]Putrefaction has ravaged this part of the city.
[77:37.78]Narrow alleyways which never see the light of day harbor nothing but misery and pestilence.
[77:42.96]You navigate the maze of streets without incident.
[77:48.08]More city streets.
[77:49.62]We're gonna go this way now.
[77:53.79]The river's water, now a putrid green, emanates with a miasma that turns your stomach.
[78:00.67]You pass through without incident.
[78:05.06]Try to get each row, you know, go horizontally.
[78:08.86]The river's water, now putrid green, is disgusting.
[78:13.04]And then here's burning rubble.
[78:15.06]God, this is not good.
[78:17.42]With a terrible crash.
[78:27.98]Just can't go that way then.
[78:28.92]Okay.
[78:54.76]well let's do hey thanks chat that's 10 max health I will take that gladly uh putrefaction has ravaged the city here is a drudge of corruption that's a lot of people another horde of corrupted is here mindless they seem unaware of your presence
[79:19.05]Let's see.
[79:21.09]Ambush.
[79:23.27]These... Come on, I can get this.
[79:31.65]Let me show you guys that I'm actually worth the gold here.
[79:38.80]Poorly done.
[79:40.86]You must harness your will and find the quiet stillness inside you.
[79:51.18]Before you can land your first blow, Coldburn lets out a scream.
[79:55.72]He got attacked and I know I can't have him.
[79:58.72]But now they're gonna fight me by myself.
[80:02.62]Oh my god, I can't even fucking... I'm like a quarter of a second slow tonight.
[80:08.40]This is what happens when you drink coffee and crash.
[80:15.07]I deserve this.
[80:15.73]I deserve to fight this by myself.
[80:18.69]I'm like a quarter of a fucking second slow.
[80:20.93]I was on top of this last night.
[80:22.93]I'm so annoyed by this shit.
[80:27.07]There's so many people here.
[80:28.69]This is so bad.
[80:29.77]Ah, well.
[80:35.04]Infected enemies are feeble, causing them to become knocked down when health is low.
[80:38.50]Use a finisher.
[80:41.70]Okay.
[80:42.16]Hi, guys.
[80:42.88]Hi, like, tiny area with a bunch of enemies.
[81:03.03]Let's get out the ship guys first.
[81:05.09]These guys can go pretty quickly.
[81:23.36]I wish I could hit more than one person with one swing.
[81:25.88]You really only get that one hit.
[81:41.65]Take it.
[81:43.69]Take it out.
[81:56.18]These guys recover.
[81:56.96]I haven't seen one recover yet, so... Thankfully they're not doing very much.
[82:03.14]Making this fairly easy.
[82:04.52]I say that now and I'm gonna get just collapsed on.
[82:07.82]Watch.
[82:18.30]Are you guys giving me a curse?
[82:23.86]Oh, no.
[82:24.50]You guys are actually voting for the curse.
[82:26.17]This is... Alright, fine.
[82:27.67]Bring it on.
[82:30.19]I'm not scared.
[82:32.39]I have the utmost confidence that I will... I will triumph regardless of the odds.
[82:46.08]Bring it on.
[82:46.60]I probably shouldn't have said that.
[82:50.15]That was probably a bad idea to say that out loud.
[82:55.23]With the Horde decimated, you resume your journey through the winding streets.
[82:58.73]We can see other paths.
[83:01.69]We got... This is new.
[83:03.43]This is a new card.
[83:04.11]Fetid Fens.
[83:04.95]Don't be mean.
[83:07.45]I'm not being mean.
[83:08.11]It's a challenge.
[83:16.18]A miasma hangs in the air, thick and rodulent, of the dead things trapped in the dark waters.
[83:21.70]Just walking this path has been known to leave travelers with a lifelong cough.
[83:26.77]You spy an old carriage through the fog, its wheels locked in the mire.
[83:30.93]The occupants either fled or were eaten by the inhabitants of the swamp long ago.
[83:36.18]Since the fog is thickest around its rotting timbers, there may yet be valuables within.
[83:42.68]Well, I just took 10.
[83:44.72]Okay.
[83:45.74]Enveloped in a thick cloud of marsh gas, you carefully make your way across the stones and fallen logs towards your target.
[84:03.69]I'll take a blue.
[84:04.99]I'll take a blue.
[84:06.33]Not going for gold right now.
[84:09.67]You make your way to the carriage and discover an old crate.
[84:12.27]The lock rips from the sodden wood, giving you access to the equipment inside.
[84:17.66]What do I have here?
[84:18.62]Binding brood, gambler's jewel.
[84:21.88]This is an artifact, isn't it?
[84:25.84]I'm okay with the weapon I have right now.
[84:27.08]Let's see what this is.
[84:29.30]It is a stun bomb.
[84:31.38]Thorough bomb that causes a short stun to an area when activated.
[84:34.35]Less effective against corrupted.
[84:35.61]Well, looks like we're not going to use this.
[84:40.54]This one adds plus two to your final score during dice gambits.
[84:49.89]I mean... Maybe I'll do this.
[84:58.59]What do you think is better?
[84:59.19]The cardinal blade or the... The axe?
[85:02.56]The hammer that I have right now?
[85:06.92]Because both of these are not good for the situation I'm in.
[85:09.22]Maybe I should just do this and...
[85:11.64]It does split in a lot of, um... You think the ring?
[85:16.30]I think the blade.
[85:17.32]I was gonna go... Yeah, I'll go with the blade.
[85:25.11]Yeah.
[85:26.89]Blade it is.
[85:28.63]You flee the wetlands, though the taint of its stench lingers with you.
[85:34.40]I'm gonna go down.
[85:37.98]The river's water, now putrid green, is gross, and now it's burning rubble.
[85:42.17]Okay.
[85:42.93]You cannot go any further.
[85:45.19]You take cover as debris settle in the streets, calming the horses again.
[85:48.15]You turn back the way you came.
[85:52.31]So I might really sincerely screw myself here, because I might be blocking myself in.
[85:58.63]Smoke fills the city and stings your eyes.
[86:00.25]The Empire intends to staunch the infection with fire.
[86:03.35]You pick up the pace.
[86:05.69]More corruption.
[86:08.54]You find yourself surrounded by another horde of corrupted.
[86:10.63]Ambush them.
[86:16.51]And my... Jackpot.
[86:21.75]Got the jackpot.
[86:22.33]Good.
[86:24.28]Quick and precise, you eliminate the first two groups of infected with litter resistance.
[86:27.30]Two monster cards are being removed.
[86:29.34]Now you can get the remaining enemies.
[86:33.56]Aiiiii.
[86:39.56]Don't- whatever. It's alright we're 1 for 2 in that situation.
[86:47.56]You went for the greed. It's okay.
[86:52.56]I got the corruption blade.
[86:57.56]That's the zoll garabzor.
[87:02.49]You know what I'm talking about?
[87:03.19]What's it, the destroyer of worlds?
[87:06.11]It's called like, like Zeander, destroyer, devourer of worlds.
[87:12.35]Let's try it here.
[87:14.67]That's extraordinarily effective.
[87:16.17]I hate to make another WoW reference, but you know, full of them.
[87:34.61]Let's get everybody surrounding me like that.
[87:36.57]That would be cool if I killed them all.
[87:45.58]That is a classic WoW reference.
[87:48.74]None of this expansion shit.
[87:51.94]Thunderfury?
[87:52.50]No, not Thunderfury.
[87:53.82]It's the one that Hakara drops.
[88:02.90]Colby, Destroyer of Worlds.
[88:05.96]Hey, Kilgannon, thanks for the one dollar.
[88:07.44]Have you considered playing Getting Over It?
[88:09.90]By the way, here's that dollar I owe you for that coffee you bought me last weekend.
[88:13.66]See you tomorrow, son.
[88:15.76]Well, thank you, Kilgannon.
[88:17.92]That's the game where you're one of those Mario pot plant people.
[88:22.82]And you have a hammer and you have to jump over a building or something.
[88:26.38]It's really frustrating and there's a lot of people screaming and yelling at it, right?
[88:32.90]You want me to play that game?
[88:36.96]You, like... You want me to play the game that's, like, the game that's not possible to beat?
[88:42.16]And you get to watch the streamer scream in agony and pulling his hair out and shit?
[88:45.98]I mean, is it actually a good game?
[88:53.86]Is it fun?
[88:55.74]Pain blessing.
[88:58.70]What did I just get?
[89:02.27]What did that do?
[89:02.71]I don't think it did anything.
[89:08.07]Well, now you have the potential to really make it not fun.
[89:13.04]It's not fun.
[89:15.90]Let's see... Grateful Merchant.
[89:20.32]You find a merchant and his family.
[89:26.09]You explain Captain Fiore's plan and help the merchant and his family onto the wagon so you've saved eight citizens.
[89:31.91]Thank you, the merchant says, boarding the wagon.
[89:34.43]Should you find yourself short of gold, I'd be happy to give you a good price for any equipment you might want to trade.
[89:41.28]So we got a new guy here.
[89:46.36]The spread of plague has rendered the district a blackened maze.
[89:51.36]There's nothing here.
[89:54.91]But what is this?
[89:56.43]Another one.
[90:00.89]Nothing here.
[90:03.31]Damn.
[90:05.67]Well, there's that.
[90:07.01]I'm not doing that.
[90:07.75]I don't want to run out of food.
[90:11.61]Dead bodies litter the streets.
[90:13.65]More burning rubble.
[90:15.71]I do need to camp and buy some food, though.
[90:19.20]Where have we not gone?
[90:20.44]Right and down.
[90:22.16]Pain, blessing.
[90:25.98]You guys, you could have taken money from me.
[90:28.34]That would have been terrible.
[90:31.94]Let's camp.
[90:33.42]I'm going to camp after this next one.
[90:39.03]Judge of corruption again.
[90:42.25]Ambush the corrupted.
[90:42.99]Let's get a gold here.
[90:47.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[90:54.03]Press it now.
[90:57.57]Sometimes you have to sing a song to get it to work.
[90:59.53]Not even kidding.
[91:01.70]Quick and precise, you eliminate the monster cards.
[91:03.96]Let's try it again.
[91:06.55]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, motherfucking G, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, and then Y, and the Z, and the Z, and the Z, and welcome to me!
[91:15.15]I've... Whatever.
[91:16.27]Don't ever do that.
[91:20.12]Doesn't work that way.
[91:29.97]Whoops.
[91:31.99]Yeah, because the song wasn't good.
[91:33.27]That was the reason.
[91:41.29]These guys really aren't that bad.
[91:44.43]I'll take brainless corrupted over the obnoxious thieves that spam grenades and leap across the map at you.
[91:53.55]And the goblins!
[91:54.97]Thank the Lord!
[91:56.84]There's been no treasure goblins!
[92:01.72]Because holy shit, those guys are unbearable.
[92:03.52]I want to get in the center here and do that again.
[92:10.86]Let's get surrounded.
[92:11.92]Doesn't go that far, I guess.
[92:27.34]Don't make it too easy, chat.
[92:32.93]I don't think this game can ever be too easy.
[92:35.73]Because this still is like a bunch of heavy RNG mechanics, right?
[92:41.04]What is the title of my stream?
[92:49.04]Oh, God.
[92:49.50]I have like a paragraph here.
[92:51.55]No, it's just... God damn it.
[92:56.83]It was just supposed to be this.
[93:04.17]Okay.
[93:04.53]Well, whatever.
[93:09.15]We're good.
[93:14.20]Star Wars?
[93:14.76]Geogia?
[93:15.42]Well, that was a reference from last night.
[93:17.04]What do you mean?
[93:21.80]What happened?
[93:22.80]Did I spell something wrong?
[93:28.41]Did I add a letter?
[93:33.22]What's incorrect?
[93:43.15]That's spelled right.
[93:49.27]R.N.
[93:49.57]Grievous.
[93:50.87]R.N.
[93:51.05]Grievous.
[93:52.05]How's that wrong?
[93:54.44]That's how you spell it.
[94:01.20]I mean, don't tell him.
[94:07.91]Go look it up.
[94:08.37]That's how you spell it.
[94:10.03]I'm not kidding around.
[94:15.63]I'm blind?
[94:17.91]What happened?
[94:18.31]I don't understand what's happening.
[94:25.24]Chat always plays with my brain.
[94:29.68]So we got this.
[94:31.06]Let's see if we know.
[94:32.12]Can't go that way.
[94:37.34]Uh, watch out for the blaze.
[94:41.00]We need to camp.
[94:41.68]I need to buy food.
[94:47.35]Buy food.
[94:49.51]Plenty of food to buy.
[94:50.45]The more citizens you save, the more you can buy.
[94:52.97]Which is a good thing.
[94:54.49]And it looks like you guys are gonna give me 20 gold, so... I'm gonna just buy it all.
[95:08.39]20, 10, or a 10.
[95:09.07]I think I've really got to work on that.
[95:11.59]Work on that here.
[95:12.29]Oh, wait, what is this?
[95:14.75]Well, I know what I'm buying.
[95:17.73]150 damage to corrupted in an area.
[95:19.23]Any corrupted killed will cause a stun and an explosion.
[95:22.58]Yes, please.
[95:23.10]I have some things to sell, right?
[95:31.20]Get rid of this.
[95:34.68]Dark Thirst.
[95:35.48]Yeah, I'm going to use the Cardinal Blade.
[95:39.70]Finish trading.
[95:41.65]Break camp.
[95:44.61]Where have I now gone?
[95:45.27]I can go... I'm going to go this way.
[95:49.56]Because... Free money!
[95:54.92]Free money, guys!
[95:58.53]I skipped around.
[95:59.45]I did hopscotch and got $20.
[96:02.93]Hungry poppers.
[96:06.33]You spy a group of poor urchins loitering in an alley.
[96:10.11]They look hungry.
[96:11.94]As you approach, they scramble into a pile of discarded crates.
[96:16.02]Offer the children food.
[96:18.70]Yes.
[96:22.06]The eldest child reaches out gingerly and snatches the food, devouring it in an instant.
[96:27.26]Hunger overcomes the rest of the group and they crawl from their hiding places to gobble up the food.
[96:31.60]Their trust gained, they board the wagons you resume your journey.
[96:35.26]Eight more citizens.
[96:38.61]I feel like I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[96:43.55]Can I buy more food?
[96:47.89]Yes, I can.
[96:51.04]Oh, what's that?
[96:51.62]You guys are gonna try to take this money from me?
[96:54.58]Twitch chat gonna try to take it away?
[96:56.82]Well, I better spend it all.
[97:04.73]Because you can't take the food from me.
[97:06.45]You can just take the money.
[97:09.65]What else can we buy?
[97:10.63]Winter's Bane?
[97:11.33]I might just buy it.
[97:12.19]Just to show you how much money I have.
[97:15.03]You know what I mean?
[97:17.48]I might just purchase this.
[97:18.42]Jessica, you're like standing behind me.
[97:21.34]I'm not going to spend the money in front of you.
[97:28.47]Let's go left, because then we can probably go up from here.
[97:34.03]No, nothing.
[97:35.12]Damn, that sucks.
[97:41.04]Grateful hero to save these citizens.
[97:45.26]Rush to their aid.
[97:46.20]Everyone's picking C now.
[97:56.91]Give him only the bad things.
[97:58.21]He needs to learn.
[98:01.75]You must learn.
[98:04.07]Learn what?
[98:06.07]Everything.
[98:12.90]That's how it's done.
[98:17.88]Ah, I thought I could hit him before he hit me.
[98:21.52]Oh well.
[98:27.44]These guys are all dead All right, I'm not gonna lose these people am I?
[98:37.65]Should be slightly irritating if you did What the hell am I going?
[98:59.51]Not this time.
[99:08.60]Execute him.
[99:13.46]Chat give and chat take away.
[99:15.08]Well, chat might not have an opportunity to take away.
[99:21.83]I might be finishing the encounter here.
[99:24.41]The mission might be over in the next three steps.
[99:27.55]Well done.
[99:29.23]Got five citizens.
[99:30.29]Corruption is gone.
[99:31.09]Let me get them all.
[99:34.61]Scouts reports.
[99:37.30]We bring word from the captain.
[99:39.02]The infected horde at the gatehouse has subsided.
[99:42.00]The corruption encounter is gone.
[99:44.60]Gates blocked by layers of corruption.
[99:45.88]The wagons cannot get through.
[99:48.08]You thank the scouts and assure them that you'll head to the gatehouse soon.
[99:50.35]I need... He's gonna deal with it?
[99:56.27]Fucking meme face?
[100:02.06]Why does the dealer have a meme face right now?
[100:08.48]What is going on?
[100:14.61]Alright.
[100:18.89]Burning rubble.
[100:22.97]I'm like scared now.
[100:29.45]Is there a developer in the chat?
[100:33.14]Is he gonna, like, hack into my game and put... I bring tidings from the creators.
[100:41.94]Oh my god.
[100:43.80]Is he gonna, like, spawn a hundred enemy zombies?
[100:50.62]Alright, well, let's go.
[100:51.38]Let's continue to try to save this.
[100:52.72]Hi!
[100:53.58]Hi, welcome to the stream.
[100:57.65]This is weird.
[101:02.51]I thought this was the guy talking that was in the game.
[101:10.56]When the dealer started talking, for some reason, I'm so freaked out.
[101:13.82]I thought that was the guy that was in here.
[101:17.66]That'd be fucking hilarious.
[101:19.76]A wounded peasant runs stumbling down the street, chased by a horde of corrupted...
[101:25.73]He falls at your feet and begins to twitch.
[101:28.33]The blood from his wounds boils and blackens.
[101:31.97]No, we fight.
[101:34.73]You ready your weapon as the Horde draw it, because there might be some citizens here.
[101:41.56]Did he delete the thousand gold from me?
[101:43.26]No, I'm like, we're getting so close to the end of this one.
[101:50.28]I'm going to laugh if something gets spawned into this game.
[102:02.27]Are we live on Twitch right now?
[102:03.85]I think so.
[102:07.07]It's possible.
[102:12.26]100.
[102:12.68]No, I thought that was 100.
[102:18.74]Double execute.
[102:19.66]You got it.
[102:24.51]Make sure you go for the karate kick.
[102:28.25]Aw, I could have had an execute there.
[102:29.49]What?
[102:32.10]Well, devs, if you're still watching, your game is very fun.
[102:35.58]And I was a big fan of the first one.
[102:39.84]And I'm like, I'm just gonna start gushing.
[102:41.38]You think it's awesome that a dev could mess with your game while you're on Twitch like that?
[102:48.58]That's cool.
[102:49.36]Yeah, that is pretty cool.
[102:54.69]With the Horde defeated, the Talonsfolk rushed to tend to the peasants.
[102:57.13]They are grateful for your protections.
[103:02.63]Is there gain survivors here?
[103:04.57]I can just press a random thing.
[103:06.22]Doesn't matter.
[103:06.58]Nah, the food would have been good.
[103:13.82]Fifteen health.
[103:14.32]Do I get any more citizens?
[103:15.53]Yes.
[103:15.95]Five citizens.
[103:20.73]This is the road to Goblin Town.
[103:23.13]Oh, we have to do it.
[103:24.23]I have to do it.
[103:25.09]It's right here.
[103:26.72]Good luck taking this token from me.
[103:29.56]Let's get this.
[103:30.58]I was looking forward to this the most.
[103:32.07]I'm going to turn on the acting here.
[103:35.47]I'm a thespian, you know what I mean?
[103:38.17]They say the road to Goblin Town is paved with gold and dead mice.
[103:43.54]Horus, son of the village idiot, has lured you to this forest cave with the promise of a hidden treasure.
[103:49.70]You regret everything.
[103:52.38]Jesuia!
[103:53.55]He points into a dark cavern.
[103:55.43]I saw a goblin hurrying into that hole not a moment ago.
[103:59.07]Goblin town is in there, I'm sure of it.
[104:04.49]Wait, we actually have to do this?
[104:06.40]I'm walking around?
[104:07.14]Huh?
[104:14.08]Oh, this is the old trap encounters.
[104:16.32]Oh, duh.
[104:18.34]I remember these from the first game.
[104:20.54]They were not fun.
[104:23.60]Which way am I going to go?
[104:24.74]This treasure over there.
[104:25.56]Let's get this chest.
[104:32.16]Five dollars.
[104:35.14]Goblins are not the wealthiest, apparently, down here.
[104:39.92]Just wipe out.
[104:40.62]It's not that bad.
[104:47.20]Nah, it's easy.
[104:50.27]Easy enough.
[104:52.17]Ow.
[104:53.75]I deserve that.
[104:54.75]I dashed into that for no reason.
[104:59.91]Anything down here?
[105:03.48]No, I'm just going in the wrong direction.
[105:10.36]Nothing?
[105:11.46]What?
[105:13.56]There's a blood chest over there.
[105:20.44]Good thing I... I was gonna say good thing I corrected that.
[105:23.40]No, no, no.
[105:24.81]Is there anything else over here?
[105:26.87]I thought there was one more chest.
[105:30.47]I can turn and look a little.
[105:33.69]Yeah, there's one here.
[105:35.39]Got the other one over there, right?
[105:36.27]Yep, let's go.
[105:44.25]Goblin Town was not that much of an issue.
[105:47.81]Ten health.
[105:50.83]What am I looking at here?
[105:56.30]The game's too easy for him.
[105:58.22]Plus the vote cheats.
[105:59.36]Something must be done.
[106:03.54]Horace is crestfallen when you tell him that Goblin Town wasn't down there.
[106:09.39]You didn't find a goblin either?
[106:11.93]Probably used their willy magics.
[106:14.13]I tell you what, if you manage to get your hands on a goblin, they might lead you there.
[106:20.11]It's going to be a goblin card.
[106:23.96]Well.
[106:26.28]I'm going to go up.
[106:30.02]Oh, you guys did that to me.
[106:36.81]It doesn't even faze me.
[106:40.09]The river's water.
[106:40.91]Come on.
[106:41.39]No new paths.
[106:50.86]Uh-huh.
[106:52.00]Burning.
[106:52.72]Damn it.
[106:57.46]I hope I can get enough stuff here.
[106:59.54]10 max health.
[107:01.47]Thanks, guys.
[107:03.69]You're so kind to me.
[107:06.79]Well, there is another city streets here.
[107:11.79]Burning rubble again.
[107:17.05]Okay, well I can go, I can get to that last area down there.
[107:23.93]Yeah.
[107:26.73]Let's go there.
[107:27.93]Oh, minus five food.
[107:29.56]Oh, okay.
[107:31.02]Yeah.
[107:32.88]That's fine.
[107:34.22]Watch what I can do.
[107:36.60]Trade.
[107:37.60]Buy food.
[107:39.48]You guys should have taken the money, don't you know?
[107:41.26]You take the money, that's how you cut it off.
[107:44.94]Always go for the money.
[107:46.94]I can buy food with money.
[107:54.74]I can see, I can see.
[107:55.92]Minus five food.
[107:56.84]It doesn't even matter.
[107:58.44]I'm playing the market right now.
[107:59.64]I'm going to have plenty to spare.
[108:06.37]Just watch.
[108:06.77]Everything's going to be fine.
[108:11.69]More plague.
[108:13.97]Fight the corruption.
[108:22.45]Knowing is half the battle.
[108:26.94]Currency can be traded for goods and services.
[108:30.00]Yes, it can.
[108:33.28]This guy is separated from the group, so take him out instantly.
[108:40.74]He swung twice.
[108:41.44]There he goes.
[108:50.13]Oh, shit.
[108:50.75]I messed it up.
[108:58.23]Yeah.
[108:59.83]Come here, you.
[109:04.64]I'm getting the gold medal here.
[109:06.82]It's gonna happen.
[109:14.82]Get him, Colby!
[109:17.26]Let's be flashy with this end, huh?
[109:20.28]Alright, I alley-ooped it.
[109:23.22]Game over.
[109:23.72]No, he missed.
[109:24.30]At least you tried.
[109:34.80]Give us an option for him to do a joke.
[109:40.14]Grateful for your... friendliness.
[109:43.71]Spin the wheel!
[109:46.86]really what happens if I fail I had nothing to okay I was gonna say that's no that would suck if that was the case there oh no you took five food from me guys all right in all actuality though everybody pay attention because some this is he bumps into me he takes some 10 20 gold from me
[110:16.51]Pay attention.
[110:16.99]We need to get this.
[110:17.55]I have to get the token here.
[110:18.50]Please.
[110:21.80]Which one?
[110:25.20]Let's get it right.
[110:25.88]And how come I can't see it?
[110:28.42]I can take more?
[110:29.36]What do you mean you can take more?
[110:38.15]I'm gonna get stuff stolen from me.
[110:43.51]I can take more.
[110:48.89]That is so scary.
[110:51.59]It's one, right?
[110:54.09]We got a 60% consensus.
[110:59.00]Beth, finally, we don't... The thief is nimble, but you manage to gain on them as they negotiate the crowd.
[111:04.99]With the thief almost at arm's reach, they knock over a barrel of apples and attempt to hinder you.
[111:09.87]Oh god, okay.
[111:18.06]Did the devs knock over those barrels?
[111:20.33]Did a dev just knock over the barrels in front of me?
[111:24.23]Did he write that and just put that in the game?
[111:34.72]Dev stole your gold.
[111:37.90]Huge failure is two.
[111:41.94]Now I'm questioning everything I am.
[111:49.07]My god damn it Why didn't I not trust With a snap you feel something being yanked off your person you're being ambushed You turn to see a few goblins running away giggling and pointing at you With no time to check what was stolen you rush after the thieving Devils defeat the goblins before they blow their horn and escape now he
[112:15.28]Don't think this I think that I hate the goblins.
[112:18.30]They're the fucking worst You you bastard I am this is my favorite enemy in the game And he took my weapon the thing that I was like screaming about last night I
[112:43.12]And I was so close to being done with this whole encounter.
[112:46.02]It's alright, bring it on.
[112:50.00]Dude, you're worse.
[112:51.47]Oh, that's funny.
[113:02.87]I'm losing it.
[113:03.71]I'm kind of losing it here.
[113:07.22]I've lost control.
[113:11.16]Fucking goblins.
[113:18.25]Chat's taking stuff from me.
[113:20.73]I got a dev that hacked my video game.
[113:25.15]What should I do?
[113:25.55]Should I call the police?
[113:30.03]Who do I call?
[113:31.57]I gotta call Bill Gates.
[113:39.29]And he put these guys in here too.
[113:41.77]He gave me the same encounter that I was last night was like, I fucking hate this game.
[113:45.11]This game's stupid.
[113:46.03]I don't like it.
[113:50.91]I'm so unhinged right now.
[113:52.94]Alright.
[114:02.63]If I buy the game now, will the devs play with me?
[114:12.51]Alright, okay.
[114:13.55]We got that out of the way.
[114:15.51]We take back the cardinal blade.
[114:17.37]It's something to do with the spot of the goblin in question awakes and flips away from you.
[114:21.04]Giggling, it escapes.
[114:23.26]So goblins are colluding with the thieves guild now.
[114:25.22]With the thugs defeated, you search their bodies for valuables.
[114:28.48]We're going to get an equipment card.
[114:32.20]I don't want this.
[114:34.30]I want to... There's eight citizens left over here.
[114:39.48]We have to save them.
[114:43.78]No, I don't see any dev traps.
[114:46.58]So this is good.
[114:48.92]Here it is.
[114:49.40]Grateful citizens.
[114:53.64]Help us, help us.
[114:54.70]I saved them all.
[114:56.22]I did it all.
[114:58.27]I win.
[115:00.87]Now we have to do the final countdown.
[115:02.47]Not yet.
[115:05.07]Keep the wagons coming.
[115:05.87]I have... Let's get to full health.
[115:14.29]Because I'm going to take one more step, and that's it.
[115:21.74]That sounds good to me.
[115:23.92]Break mission, this is it.
[115:25.54]Let's just beat this with a full 60-60.
[115:31.54]Final... At long last you arrive at the final gatehouse, the exit out of the Old City.
[115:39.07]Leave the Old City.
[115:40.95]You usher the frightened citizens through the gate and to their escape.
[115:45.35]My thanks to you.
[115:47.17]I doubt we could have done anything more for the people of the Old City.
[115:51.47]Halt!
[115:52.47]A voice shouts from beyond the gate.
[115:54.43]You turn to see a troop of Empire soldiers marching through the gatehouse.
[116:00.33]By decree of the Emperor, none are permitted to leave the Old City.
[116:05.02]Captain Fiore, you are to return to the Imperial City at once to report.
[116:10.60]Their captain commands.
[116:12.54]Captain Fiori scoffs, calling to the young captain blocking the gate.
[116:17.18]These people bear no bark of corruption, tree bark.
[116:20.68]All they want is safe passage.
[116:22.96]Emperor decree or no, it is our duty to protect them.
[116:27.89]What good is a soldier who cannot follow commands?
[116:31.63]What is an empire without order?
[116:34.51]The young captain retorts, he's young, proudly.
[116:37.73]By decree of the emperor, none are permitted to leave the old city.
[116:42.44]Captain Fiori draws her pistol gun, standing between the cowering Old City refugees and the Emperor's decree.
[116:49.87]I will not stand down.
[116:52.81]Heavy weapons are recommended against Empire.
[116:54.79]You can change in the inventory.
[116:56.97]I believe I have a rusty axe, so no.
[117:01.64]I'm going to stay with... We're going to stay with the cargo blade.
[117:13.04]I do have the bomb.
[117:13.84]Although it doesn't do anything, does it?
[117:15.70]Okay.
[117:20.20]Well, let's win.
[117:20.92]Time to fight.
[117:28.68]With all 60 citizens on the screen.
[117:31.83]They're just running in the background screaming.
[117:38.15]I sure wish you guys got that food there.
[117:43.09]Captain Sterling, he hears the pleas from the old city but does not weep.
[117:46.75]Orders are orders.
[117:48.37]Captains wear armor that dulls standard attacks, use bash to break it.
[117:51.35]Yes, Captain Sterling, here we go.
[117:54.43]Captain Grand British Sterling.
[117:59.77]British Pound Sterling.
[118:09.20]I jumped over that guy, just jump roped that dude.
[118:14.49]That guy just is pretending to be dead because he couldn't even fucking believe what he just saw.
[118:23.17]Let's get rid of these guys first.
[118:25.65]Somebody's shooting at me.
[118:34.04]Scott Sterling.
[118:36.72]Wait, is that the wrestler?
[118:41.10]Scott Steiner is the wrestler.
[118:43.18]Scott Steiner.
[118:44.38]That's what I thought you were saying.
[118:45.48]The Steiner Brothers.
[119:00.43]The captain remains here.
[119:04.61]You lost your armor, captain.
[119:07.61]Looks like it's the end for you, back against the wall.
[119:14.00]Not much left you can do.
[119:17.44]Jumped over that, too.
[119:20.12]Well, I would have liked a flashier end, but... That was fun.
[119:39.66]Ahhhh!
[119:46.45]And there you have it.
[119:48.65]Hooray, the chariot!
[120:17.12]For finding safe patches through the plague-ridden city.
[120:22.41]The plague.
[120:24.07]Alchemist.
[120:25.97]The alchemist card looks really cool.
[120:28.11]Yvonne's Cottage and Street Fighter.
[120:35.00]Empire's Burden.
[120:36.66]Archer's Bane.
[120:38.52]Belvin's Favor.
[120:39.90]An Elusive Charm.
[120:41.68]For saving a blacksmith from the old city your supplies have been added to.
[120:45.21]Leather Armor.
[120:47.56]for befriending Estrella, the mayor of Farwater, and the soldier.
[120:57.40]For rescuing all of the citizens.
[121:00.39]Hrithgar's Quake and Grifter's Companion.
[121:04.05]That is an item that I would like to put in my deck.
[121:10.63]Finally, for the burning building, right?
[121:15.53]Bitter Winter.
[121:17.91]And Goblin Town, right?
[121:20.21]For Surviving Horus' suggestion, follow the goblin and one drunken knight.
[121:27.16]Oh, that's... Alright, that's cool.
[121:29.18]We got follow the goblin.
[121:40.22]Speaking of goblins... No, I'm not doing that one yet.
[121:49.70]So.
[121:51.38]There's a lot more too, isn't there?
[121:54.24]So we got strength, the hermit, and the wheel.
[121:57.46]The hermit seems pretty interesting.
[122:01.92]Do the kingdom hearts quest?
[122:03.01]That's what we did last night and I failed three times.
[122:07.37]And then a dev is in here and he puts salt.
[122:11.39]They put salt in my wound by making me have to fight them again.
[122:17.63]I'll do one more.
[122:19.79]We'll do one more for tonight, and we'll wrap it up.
[122:22.65]The Hermit or the Wheel.
[122:23.81]What do you think?
[122:24.19]Hmm.
[122:32.58]The Hermit looks like it could be really interesting.
[122:41.02]Hmm.
[122:46.69]Let's go with Hermit.
[122:49.17]The Hermit.
[122:52.79]Rumor has it there is a powerful magician hidden in a devilishly confusing and dangerous forest of eternal snow.
[123:01.87]Finding your way is one thing.
[123:03.18]Knowing where to go is another.
[123:04.50]Avoid danger using map reveal.
[123:07.14]The road ahead may be long.
[123:08.46]Ensure you have enough food.
[123:09.68]This is a long one.
[123:11.66]Prepare for combat against Empire.
[123:16.93]So she does retry precision, melee fighter, and combo attack.
[123:24.95]I'm going to say... I think I want... Devilishly.
[123:38.08]Hmm.
[123:44.98]Let me see what this is again.
[123:47.12]I'm gonna get lost.
[123:48.02]It's gonna be a lot of chance.
[123:52.58]Well, let's just use her.
[123:54.70]It's because she's new.
[124:01.98]Alchemist is what I want.
[124:03.02]I don't want to do her quest right now.
[124:06.36]Yvonne's Cottage.
[124:07.11]Bitter Winter.
[124:08.19]Follow the Goblin.
[124:09.01]One Drunken Knight.
[124:09.79]Street Fight.
[124:12.65]Still have to win that.
[124:14.80]Elder's Gift.
[124:16.24]Because I want the... I want to see what that ring is.
[124:21.80]I'm going to have to put it in, right?
[124:23.28]I have to put in Market Thief.
[124:25.20]Yeah, I do.
[124:28.30]It's not that I like the card.
[124:29.42]It's the fact that I want the coin.
[124:32.35]And I can't do it.
[124:39.47]Hmm.
[124:43.41]Which one of these could help?
[124:46.75]Exploding doodads.
[124:48.31]It gives you artifacts.
[124:53.50]The gnomish exchange was awesome.
[124:55.68]That's a ton of money.
[124:59.38]This is new, but why would you put this in?
[125:03.19]Fight corrupted.
[125:07.15]Oh, okay.
[125:08.69]So this is a fight, but you gain something to the wheel at the end.
[125:12.11]I'll put that in.
[125:16.18]Filter by rewards.
[125:17.22]Yeah.
[125:18.60]That's a good idea.
[125:19.80]That's a good thing.
[125:22.31]I'm just trying to see, like, what I would want to do, like, encounter-wise.
[125:25.47]I guess let's just put hers.
[125:28.27]No, no, no, no.
[125:29.87]Winding Trail.
[125:34.41]Archer's Bane.
[125:35.07]It was Empire, right?
[125:39.36]So we're looking for Armor Breakers.
[125:43.38]Critical Strike.
[125:50.40]Should I put this in?
[125:51.42]Just because.
[125:55.34]Still haven't seen this.
[125:56.53]Still haven't seen this.
[125:57.55]Empire's Burden.
[125:59.79]Put in some of the new... I'm just going to grab these.
[126:05.15]Elusive Charm.
[126:06.61]There it is.
[126:07.07]I can't see what it does, right?
[126:09.21]I want this in here.
[126:12.08]Ruby Ring.
[126:12.54]You can hold a bunch of rings.
[126:17.14]Alright, three equipment slots.
[126:18.42]Let's take an extra five food.
[126:30.51]Who... What is the... What does the Empire count as?
[126:36.73]Yeah, they're like their own thing, right?
[126:42.55]Northerners... They're just like regular people, right?
[126:53.56]Take the leather armor.
[126:55.93]Empire counts as empire.
[126:57.05]What's like the best against empire?
[127:00.35]Probably just a regular sword, right?
[127:07.37]Hmm.
[127:10.84]I don't know.
[127:11.26]Alright, you need like an armor destroyer.
[127:16.66]Yeah, I'll take the axe then.
[127:20.75]All right.
[127:22.37]So let me just... Let me use the bathroom one more time.
[127:27.23]I'm just going to go take a pee.
[127:29.17]I'll be right back.
[127:33.89]I'll see you guys for the final encounter.
[127:37.33]Win or lose here, this is going to be the end.
[127:38.91]I will be back in two minutes.
[127:41.87]See you in a minute.
[128:13.20]Thank you.
[128:43.74]Thank you.
[129:47.46]okay we're back before we start I do want to just catch up with the bits here um down here uh thank you dac thank you dacatastrophe for the one dollar
[130:08.89]Okay, I'm going to clear a few things up for JoJo.
[130:11.19]First of all, avoid looking up anything until you decide if you like it or not.
[130:14.01]This series has spawned a lot of memes that can come across as obnoxious.
[130:18.11]Second, if you find it boring, just stick through it until episode 10.
[130:22.43]I swear to God you will love the very first scene of episode 10.
[130:25.97]You can also skip to 10.
[130:28.10]And then go back to 1 to 9 later if you just want to get a feel for the series.
[130:36.44]Jesus.
[130:37.65]Don't skip 10 episodes.
[130:40.73]Thank you.
[130:42.11]I appreciate the bits and the advice.
[130:45.44]Maybe I'll see you.
[130:47.93]Thank you, The Pat Marson, for the $1.
[130:50.49]Jerjer's Bizarre Stream Adventure.
[130:52.45]You have rallied new allies to your cause, and they have given you their gold.
[130:56.83]Surely some of that should go to me.
[131:00.35]Me?
[131:01.97]For real, though, thanks for the $5.
[131:02.95]I've been recommending you play Megaton Rainfall on stream, so here's a link to the Steam page.
[131:09.26]It's out next week.
[131:10.78]It's available on PS4 and PSVR.
[131:14.26]I will absolutely take a look at it.
[131:16.26]We will check that out soon.
[131:17.96]Maybe.
[131:18.62]Whatever it is.
[131:19.42]I don't even know what it is.
[131:20.42]I keep saying I'm going to look at it, but who knows?
[131:22.50]Maybe I'll just close my eyes and click the link.
[131:26.18]Anyways.
[131:28.14]Thank you, also.
[131:29.24]Thank you, 4realdo, for the $5.
[131:30.84]Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[131:31.76]Hey, Jeremy, it's your dad.
[131:34.19]Just coming in to say your stream sucks lately.
[131:36.57]You've been acting like a real dickie.
[131:38.45]Ha ha ha.
[131:40.52]Oh, sorry, Dad.
[131:41.96]I'll try harder.
[131:43.60]Ben, thanks.
[131:44.38]Another $25 from Ben.
[131:47.14]A wizard is never late, nor is he early.
[131:49.02]Can you finish the quote, Gandalf?
[131:52.29]A wizard is never late, nor is he early.
[131:55.39]Please stop it.
[131:57.25]I don't want a swirly while I'm hanging upside down and being dunked into the school bathroom.
[132:03.57]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[132:05.07]Have you considered playing?
[132:06.19]I already got this one.
[132:11.09]Ben, again, with $25.
[132:12.99]Jesus Christ.
[132:16.25]Thank you for the $300, dude.
[132:19.49]Jesus.
[132:20.63]Damn.
[132:22.63]How's the new PC hardware looking, by the way?
[132:24.43]Well, tomorrow you'll find out.
[132:26.57]We're building a PC from scratch tomorrow.
[132:29.45]I'm going to put those in quotes.
[132:30.89]That's going to be in quotes.
[132:32.60]But it's looking pretty good.
[132:34.46]I think you'll enjoy it.
[132:36.52]Thank you, though, for the massive amount of funds you have deposited into my Twitch TV bank account.
[132:44.16]Killgen, thank you for the $1.
[132:45.98]It's really fucking lame when devs do this shit.
[132:48.67]What?
[132:48.97]What?
[132:50.79]Why?
[132:51.07]He's just having some fun.
[132:53.11]He's just messing around.
[132:53.91]He's just having a laughing about it a little bit.
[132:55.69]Twitch has bank accounts?
[133:05.72]uh it's always the first card says flinchy ferret for one dollar thanks man always I find it to be quite humorous I think it was fun uh max mod thanks for the one dollar jeremy this stream is amazing you plus dev hacking makes my night well thank the dev that's here or was here because that was hilarious that was really funny
[133:26.68]I was absolutely, uh, completely taken aback by that.
[133:29.30]I did not... It freaked me out when the... I thought I... You know sometimes when a game has, like, a 1% chance for something to happen?
[133:37.64]When those glasses came down on the dealer, I just thought it was one of those cases where, oh, I'm... I'm sitting at the menu and I have, like, this 0.02% chance for this weird Mario animation where he, like, sleeps.
[133:53.27]Was here, in quotes.
[133:54.81]Ha ha ha ha.
[134:00.57]I'm still here waiting.
[134:07.75]I better get going.
[134:08.41]I'm like boring the dev.
[134:12.72]But thank you, MaxBotMacaroni.
[134:16.46]Yves, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[134:18.30]I just want to say I love you also.
[134:19.68]I used an old quote of yours as my senior quote, and I was questioned by my school what it meant, and I regret my decision.
[134:27.13]What kind of crazy shit are you writing in your school yearbook, man?
[134:32.72]Look, I'm not a role model.
[134:35.62]I mean, I might be a model, a male model, not a role model.
[134:42.81]But thanks for the $10, dude.
[134:43.79]Hopefully I didn't get in too much trouble.
[134:46.51]Trinzy, thanks for the $15.
[134:47.81]They suggested skipping to episode 10 because JoJo's is split into parts.
[134:52.17]Part 2 starts at episode 10 and has an entirely different story and main character.
[134:56.35]Spoiler alert, dude.
[135:00.29]Take your time.
[135:00.83]Your fate is your own until it isn't.
[135:08.59]I feel like something bad is going to happen in this playthrough.
[135:12.43]Here.
[135:14.53]Here we go.
[135:15.69]But thank you, Trinzy, for the $15 and even for the $10.
[135:17.29]Here we go.
[135:17.63]Stop talking about Jojo, you stupids.
[135:18.65]I didn't say that.
[135:19.17]That was a chatter.
[135:19.93]It's a devilish forest.
[135:21.43]While exploring the wild lands...
[135:38.07]You arrive quite suddenly at the fringes of a curiously enchanted winter forest.
[135:42.87]Where you stand, it is a warm summer afternoon.
[135:45.13]Yet only ten steps away, the cedars are gray with frost and the ground is blanketed in thick snow.
[135:53.70]Horrendous!
[135:54.88]You turn in surprise to face Estrella, but it is not she who spoke.
[136:02.50]An Empire general in an impressively plumed helm approaches you.
[136:07.10]A sizable company of Empire soldiers are arrayed behind him.
[136:11.26]Horrendous, isn't it?
[136:12.84]This smear of obstinate mage filth-staining the land.
[136:17.74]With a start, the general recognizes your companion.
[136:21.42]Captain Fiore, what business do you have here with this mercenary?
[136:27.12]Estrella keeps her demeanor.
[136:29.51]She's got a good demeanor.
[136:31.63]Unofficial business, General Willem.
[136:34.59]He bows in concession.
[136:36.29]Regardless, I'd advise that this frozen waste is far too dangerous for your unofficial business.
[136:41.75]The ground changes underfoot and the blizzards tear your skin to shreds.
[136:47.64]He gestures as his troop and his troops split into small parties and head into the wasteland.
[136:52.50]He turns to you and bows deeply before following the last party in.
[136:57.08]Never fear, citizen.
[136:58.86]This mage will be the blade of the Empire's justice.
[137:04.56]Let's go.
[137:07.92]You notice Estrella relax her hand from her pistol.
[137:11.56]I do not take such powerful magic lightly, usually.
[137:14.62]She gestures to the winter forest.
[137:16.85]However, I believe this hermit deserves a fair warning and a fair fight.
[137:23.62]Raiders, now Raiders blow up the side of your barn and they grab you.
[137:31.84]Party of Northerners charges at you as you break free.
[137:34.33]You got trapped.
[137:37.41]I thought that was, what was his name, Olsen?
[137:54.65]Wilson?
[137:55.07]What was the guy's name?
[137:56.05]Oswald?
[137:57.85]Estrella.
[137:58.27]Having only ever known military life, Estrella's high rank and fame were justly earned.
[138:03.66]When activated, Estrella performs powerful attacks and causes knockdowns.
[138:07.88]Stay close to charge her ability faster.
[138:15.55]Oh shit, I'm trapped.
[138:24.33]You can't riposte, right?
[138:26.11]No, not these guys, unless you have a different weapon.
[138:38.25]So she's kind of just a more... less tanky... Oh my god, did I really just dive into that ship?
[138:45.28]Let's see if she's better than Colby.
[138:50.82]I think anybody's better than Colby.
[138:54.88]If I'm honest.
[138:58.24]I'm probably just not utilizing his left bumper ability well.
[139:02.52]Ah, fuck.
[139:08.41]Thanks for the help.
[139:13.71]He thought this was Thursday, and today was the PC build.
[139:15.55]The PC build is tomorrow.
[139:17.60]I had to do one last final, last second adjustment.
[139:22.10]It is ready for tomorrow.
[139:25.13]Search for spoils.
[139:27.53]Oh, Lord.
[139:27.95]I think it's this one.
[139:32.90]Oh, my God.
[139:33.50]I'm so bad.
[139:34.28]I didn't even give you guys a chance to vote.
[139:36.08]I was so confident that that was... Whatever.
[139:39.78]One of the Northerners grabs you with his last breath.
[139:41.50]He stabs you in the stomach.
[139:46.74]We're looking for the hermit.
[139:47.84]So again, we're going to do the technique where you go in a spiral.
[139:51.40]Bitter winter.
[139:53.50]Across a snow-covered field, you see a lonely homestead.
[140:01.42]As you approach, you are greeted by the occupants, a farmer and his family.
[140:05.72]The farmer wrings his hands nervously as he fights his pride.
[140:10.64]I don't suppose you can spare my family some food?
[140:13.60]We have very few supplies to last us the winter.
[140:16.26]We would be most grateful.
[140:18.56]Fine, take eight.
[140:20.36]Bless your soul.
[140:21.96]The farmer gasps as you hand him the food.
[140:26.86]This is more than I could have ever expected from a stranger.
[140:30.22]I will spread word of this deed.
[140:32.36]And come the harvest, I will repay this gesture as best as I can.
[140:37.24]The dealer adds an encounter card to the deck.
[140:41.32]Harvest.
[140:41.58]Harvest.
[140:43.72]Harvest.
[140:48.03]A balance of resources is key.
[140:50.39]No one wants to perish wealthy, but starving.
[140:53.47]Oh, okay.
[140:55.98]Well, alright.
[140:57.60]I probably should have paid attention to that.
[141:00.88]Further into the forest you hear a smattering of voices carried on the wind from somewhere to the east.
[141:06.33]You motion Estrella to stay behind before cautiously approaching the voices.
[141:10.41]You spy a small empire party taking a break from their zealous manhunt.
[141:16.13]Obscured by fog and brambles, you consider your options.
[141:20.04]If you stay hidden, you might learn more of the forest, but you also risk discovery.
[141:23.12]Stay hidden.
[141:26.12]Here we go.
[141:27.36]It's just only gold.
[141:32.21]Got that gold bar.
[141:35.24]A soldier whistles and sits down.
[141:37.96]It's a good thing the captain thought to give us these shields.
[141:41.06]We'd be wrong to run into blizzards in that blasted imp otherwise.
[141:45.79]You spy a shining shield resting against a boulder just in reach of your hiding place.
[141:50.19]Is this the enchanted shield the soldier mentioned?
[141:53.33]To your dismay, a soldier balancing an overflowing bowl of stew sits down in front of your hiding place.
[142:02.00]Steal the shield.
[142:04.69]Oh, Lord.
[142:13.33]Oh, what the fuck?
[142:15.09]Yes, I would like to retry the pendulum, please do retry.
[142:29.32]What an unfortunate time for your skills to leave you.
[142:36.70]Ugh!
[142:36.96]God damn it!
[142:44.41]Steal the shield!
[142:46.23]I'm gonna get it right now.
[142:47.31]Three, two, one... Who the blazes are you?
[143:00.18]You look up and the guy's there.
[143:02.42]What a disappointment you must be when those who crafted this are watching your fumbling moves.
[143:09.04]Surely you can do better.
[143:13.30]Dev is making fun of me right now.
[143:15.61]He's calling me names.
[143:18.35]You'll think of a clever retort later.
[143:19.93]Well, it's only a matter of time before the sounds of combat attract another patrol.
[143:22.93]Rude Dev.
[143:32.48]Fuck.
[143:35.04]Yeah, I get something.
[143:36.08]I gotta keep... I'm always above.
[143:38.57]I'm always too far forward with that.
[143:44.31]Barely more than a woodchopper's tool.
[143:48.71]Yeah, they will draw attention.
[143:52.66]Well, I'm gonna have to make sure that doesn't happen.
[143:57.02]Hey, the dev that's in the chat, give me like an extra 60 seconds.
[144:01.78]Look at how everyone's fucking with me with this Twitch integration.
[144:04.38]They're gonna take my food away, they're gonna get my max health.
[144:06.82]Look at this bullshit.
[144:07.90]Give me an extra 40% HP.
[144:08.96]Get it.
[144:09.30]Get it.
[144:26.34]See?
[144:26.58]The def was listening.
[144:27.28]He slowed that clock down.
[144:31.28]Half the time.
[144:38.39]Oh, boo-hoo.
[144:39.11]You were taunting us last campaign.
[144:40.85]I know.
[144:41.59]I'm just kidding.
[144:43.55]Loot the bodies and hurry away.
[144:44.65]Get an equipment card.
[144:48.26]This is a knockdown bomb.
[144:50.28]Throw a bomb that causes knockdown to a single target and damage to an area when activated.
[144:56.50]So it hits one person and then knocks everybody down.
[145:00.66]Five uses.
[145:01.34]Sure, I'll take it.
[145:06.16]One drunken night.
[145:08.68]You feel cold stone against your cheek, head pounding.
[145:11.20]You open your bleary eyes.
[145:13.42]The unmistakable scrape of metal wakes you fully from your slumber and you slowly take stock of your surroundings.
[145:20.73]So I'm just shit-faced.
[145:22.43]I just woke up.
[145:26.55]Don't give him health.
[145:27.41]Is this going to be hard to control?
[145:31.49]There's health in here if you can find it.
[145:36.01]Alright.
[145:37.58]I'll take a challenge.
[145:40.44]Let's go right first.
[145:41.98]I'm going to be really careful.
[145:42.90]This is like bear traps.
[145:44.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[145:46.06]Just go, go.
[145:46.78]Just take the fucking damage boost and go.
[145:55.85]I'll take that challenge.
[145:58.97]There's health if you can find it, huh?
[146:01.43]Where's that goblin?
[146:02.29]Let's wrap around the left.
[146:11.14]More money.
[146:13.74]What is that down there?
[146:14.48]Okay, I get to dance for us.
[146:19.40]Look, I am.
[146:19.98]See?
[146:23.08]Clever devs, huh?
[146:24.82]You thought I was gonna, like, dance and get caught up in the thing?
[146:27.00]I'm smart.
[146:27.88]I'm intelligent.
[146:30.72]I didn't make it, like, a great, fantastic video game, but I've got... Look at my smarts here!
[146:36.52]Oh, almost got me there, dev!
[146:43.27]I got a brain, too, you know.
[146:44.25]I'll use it.
[146:51.72]Ooh, nice slap chop.
[146:53.43]Nope, not gonna get me there.
[146:55.87]What's in here?
[146:57.29]Ooh, five watermelons, whatever that was.
[146:59.87]Hey, I did that on purpose.
[147:06.80]Watch out for the spikes.
[147:11.42]I can see them.
[147:18.63]See, here's the health.
[147:19.97]There's health in here if you can find it.
[147:21.15]It's right here.
[147:22.33]20 HP.
[147:22.85]We're good.
[147:23.33]Did I miss anything?
[147:27.53]Tarts, pies, and exotic lies.
[147:29.19]Should I throw a grenade?
[147:31.02]I know where he is.
[147:32.50]Yeah.
[147:33.16]You don't think I know where you are?
[147:35.54]Oh, what's that?
[147:36.46]The dev is down there.
[147:39.58]No, the joke doesn't even work.
[147:40.58]I was going to throw a grenade down there.
[147:43.40]Can I get out of this?
[147:46.33]I don't think... You know, that was going to be kind of potentially funny, but it wasn't at all.
[147:56.19]He was hiding down there in the spider webs.
[148:04.28]Sorry, I made it through.
[148:05.18]Two fame.
[148:07.38]Follow the stairs upward until you emerge in a forest, the morning sun burning your eyes.
[148:11.76]You fumble in your haversack for something to eat.
[148:14.52]Happily, you find a half-eaten pasty and try to find your way out of the woods.
[148:20.74]Very nice.
[148:24.14]Further in.
[148:28.42]I think I got lucky here.
[148:30.34]You find a tree etched with a strange marking.
[148:32.32]Is this a sign pointing toward the hermit?
[148:36.42]The clean snow is marred by heavy footprints.
[148:38.30]The Empire must be ahead of you.
[148:41.27]The Empire draws four days closer to the Hermit.
[148:43.48]Not knowing what else to do, you press on.
[148:46.76]So this is the right way.
[148:48.94]I'm going the right way.
[148:51.52]Yep.
[148:52.54]You find a tree after the strange marking.
[148:54.04]This is a sign pointing toward the Hermit.
[148:57.01]Yep.
[149:00.61]Keep going.
[149:02.63]Winter Trail.
[149:05.87]A bluebird alights on a tree and begins to chirp.
[149:09.45]You wonder whether it is too merely...
[149:14.11]My brain turned off mid-sentence.
[149:17.17]A bluebird alights on a tree and begins to chirp.
[149:19.33]You wonder whether it too is merely a product of the hermit's magic.
[149:23.71]Going the right way?
[149:25.15]Further in?
[149:30.47]It's going to be right down here somewhere.
[149:31.65]Blizzard.
[149:32.05]The devs hacked in my brain too.
[149:39.57]With little warning, a snowstorm sweeps in from the north.
[149:42.19]The snow whips against you like shards of glass and obscures your vision.
[149:45.23]You struggle to find cover.
[149:47.53]The storm tears through the forest, erasing your tracks.
[149:49.89]The empire falls four days behind.
[149:53.91]Oh no.
[149:57.65]Don't even need your help.
[150:00.82]Don't even need anybody's help.
[150:02.08]Instantly got that one.
[150:03.78]You fall half-blind into a cave obscured by rock and bramble, a perfect shelter from the storm.
[150:12.52]I'm a creature of confusion, but no malice.
[150:17.52]A small blue imp materializes on the path ahead of you.
[150:20.92]It grins, revealing rows of needle-like teeth.
[150:25.83]I am Sharptooth.
[150:28.09]The creature rushes at you.
[150:30.57]Arms outstretched, you back away from its enthusiastic embrace.
[150:34.35]Undeterred, Sharptooth merely grins.
[150:35.99]I will move the forest around.
[150:41.81]Say yes, Empire will fall ten days behind.
[150:43.84]I feel like there's a caveat here.
[150:52.90]There's a catch.
[151:00.65]Yes.
[151:02.43]I knew it.
[151:04.51]God damn it.
[151:05.13]It just fucked me up too.
[151:07.47]The forest spasms and the trees on the horizon shift back and forth as it moves by an invisible hand.
[151:13.41]Seemingly content, Sharptooth simply fades from view, waving cheerfully all the while.
[151:19.58]It shuffles the whole forest.
[151:21.60]Well, guess what, guys?
[151:23.52]The hermit's right here.
[151:24.26]Yeah, that would have been fucking great.
[151:29.30]Alright, they're ahead of you.
[151:30.20]It must be... Let's go over here.
[151:33.06]Thanks for the 20 gold, guys.
[151:35.85]Appreciate it.
[151:40.03]nice job 20 gold you guys are great I don't have any food left for money these are actions I'd expect of the user from you I had hoped to see better take it away no don't take it away I need that money now I need it bad one day you come across a bare knuckle competition in an alley an old man with few remaining teeth notes your interest
[152:09.09]When choosing your opponents, remember that your purse, if you survive, will depend how quickly you beat them.
[152:18.88]Fight the Empire.
[152:20.82]You point out the Empire guards nearby who were betting on the fights rather than arresting anybody.
[152:24.75]So we have to take them out fast.
[152:39.51]I can do that.
[152:41.43]This is a phalanx.
[152:43.73]Soldier, the expansion of the empire requires constant conscription of new blood.
[152:49.13]Soldiers block all attacks, greatly reducing their damage.
[152:51.63]Use bash to open them up.
[152:53.73]Okay.
[152:54.45]He just shot his own guy.
[152:56.35]Execute.
[153:12.75]Thanks for taking that.
[153:13.65]Appreciate it.
[153:19.61]Who's left?
[153:20.75]You?
[153:23.83]Forget about it.
[153:24.23]These guys take the most amount of hits, so they have to go first.
[153:26.27]Come on!
[153:31.87]Get out of here!
[153:37.53]Plenty of time.
[153:54.60]Street fight.
[153:58.20]Hey Trinzy, thanks again for the $15.
[153:59.81]We're doing more like JoJo's Bizarre Land.
[154:08.69]Hey, hello, my name is No Impulse Control, and I'm here to inform you that the reason this game is a JoJo's reference is because in part three, there's a prominent stand naming theme that's tarot cards.
[154:19.56]The main character card is the star, while the protagonist cards are the fool, the hermit, the magician, the chariot, and the heraphant.
[154:27.10]The main villain is the world.
[154:29.30]Ooh.
[154:32.89]Well, thank you.
[154:34.59]Hey, no impulse control.
[154:35.95]Thank you, no impulse control for the $15 and that data.
[154:43.60]You are one to be reckoned with, the organizer comments as he brings forward a chest.
[154:46.48]10 life.
[154:49.37]10 gold.
[154:49.73]10 gold.
[154:51.57]This is a great card.
[154:53.77]As long as you can beat it in a short amount of time.
[154:57.15]So let's go up into the land.
[154:58.67]I need to eat food.
[154:59.97]What am I doing?
[155:00.56]Buy food.
[155:03.27]Alright, they're getting close.
[155:06.91]I need to eat.
[155:08.53]Alright, uh, trade.
[155:14.26]Buy food.
[155:16.34]Oh, he only has two food?
[155:17.70]Is there food on that list?
[155:21.76]No, it's just money.
[155:22.54]I don't need money.
[155:30.09]Stun defense.
[155:30.91]Tight pockets.
[155:31.49]Reduces the chance of goblins stealing an item by 50%.
[155:34.29]Reduces gold stolen by 50%.
[155:38.18]Cause a breach stun to thieves who hit the player with melee attacks.
[155:42.74]I don't know if that's worth that much money.
[155:46.98]That's just too much money.
[155:52.16]Let's... I don't know.
[155:53.70]Let me keep it all.
[155:58.71]Just because I don't need money doesn't mean you have to take it from me.
[156:06.26]Okay, I'm going to say right here.
[156:13.72]Mage hunting.
[156:16.08]While trudging through the snow, you hear a shout and the sound of swords being drawn.
[156:21.48]It's only a matter of time before the sounds of combat attract another patrol.
[156:30.01]It's gonna be walking in circles.
[156:31.15]Where's that weird golem guy that can turn the world upside down?
[156:38.05]They will draw time.
[156:38.85]I have a minute to do this.
[156:49.24]Die.
[156:51.90]Can clear out a few of these at the same time.
[156:54.26]One more.
[156:54.78]Come on, stay down.
[156:55.44]Let me get four kills here real quick.
[157:17.80]Last guy.
[157:18.52]Whoa!
[157:22.96]Got him.
[157:25.68]Reverse stream that watches our webcams and pays us.
[157:33.87]What are you talking about?
[157:36.45]Loot the bodies.
[157:38.13]Max HP.
[157:40.00]Five food.
[157:43.04]And up.
[157:46.04]A winding trail.
[157:48.11]Suddenly a tree falls across the path blocking the way ahead.
[157:50.39]Weapons bristle from the trees around you.
[157:52.17]Their wielders face obscured by the undergrowth.
[157:58.19]Attack the cowardly band.
[157:59.37]I'm not going to give them 58 gold.
[158:01.13]No fucking way.
[158:01.77]Just kill them.
[158:07.50]You wish I would show my face right now.
[158:09.06]Well, watch the stream tomorrow.
[158:10.80]The whole stream is my face.
[158:13.22]I'm going to be building a computer.
[158:17.55]I don't know if heavy weapons are really bad for thieves.
[158:29.45]They can avoid them very easily.
[158:31.71]Oh, what?
[158:35.40]I just got riposted.
[158:36.62]He almost did it again.
[158:52.80]You bet I'm ugly.
[158:55.86]Well, it's your own opinion if you want to... You feel that way, you feel that way.
[159:00.42]I can't change your opinion.
[159:04.23]I'm going to demand they give me this boils.
[159:06.83]Because, like, fuck these guys.
[159:12.11]Mercenary garb in this one.
[159:13.59]What is this?
[159:15.24]First kill.
[159:15.72]An enemy is randomly highlighted.
[159:17.44]If that enemy is killed first, gain five life.
[159:21.62]Optionally remove a card from each wheel gambit.
[159:25.01]Um, yeah.
[159:26.07]I think so.
[159:27.35]That sounds great.
[159:28.17]Blizzard.
[159:32.97]They're gonna lose time.
[159:35.19]Empire falls four days behind.
[159:36.57]The storm tears through.
[159:37.53]This is... Gotta get this one.
[159:41.95]I think it's three.
[159:44.21]You guys can help me out on this one, but I think it's three.
[159:54.34]It's funny that it goes, it's like 80% won for the first two seconds.
[160:05.87]Yep.
[160:06.75]You gotta go with your gut feeling.
[160:09.41]I was right.
[160:12.49]Why can't I do that more often?
[160:13.51]Uh, what about over here?
[160:17.49]Another blizzard.
[160:18.80]Oh god, can I get this three times in a row?
[160:21.12]They fell four days behind.
[160:22.22]I gotta get it again.
[160:26.54]I think it was three again.
[160:38.37]How confident am I?
[160:44.71]Two.
[160:49.97]Two?
[160:51.45]Half of you think it's two.
[160:55.37]Wow.
[160:56.85]Okay, I went with the audience that time.
[160:59.27]Glad I did.
[161:01.77]And I got 20 extra gold.
[161:04.01]Can you reach the end of this challenge before you starve to death?
[161:08.31]Time will tell.
[161:11.83]Thanks for the... Thanks, like, dev for telling me that I need to buy food now.
[161:18.93]Trade.
[161:19.61]What do you got for equipment?
[161:20.87]Archer's Bane.
[161:21.47]What is this?
[161:21.81]Oh, absolutely.
[161:24.49]Absolutely.
[161:28.34]250% damage to single target.
[161:29.40]Deal 125% damage to Empire.
[161:31.44]And it can riposte.
[161:34.62]Yes.
[161:35.36]Give this to me now.
[161:38.22]Thank you.
[161:40.52]There's no food here.
[161:43.56]But I'm going to sell the Warrior's Axe.
[161:46.48]I'm going to sell... No, that's it.
[161:48.87]No?
[161:49.59]This is pretty good.
[161:56.48]This frost will kill us if we stay here much longer, she states.
[161:58.84]Matter of fact, we find the Hermit before the Empire does.
[162:04.38]Where the hell is this guy?
[162:07.57]Further in.
[162:09.37]Four days.
[162:09.91]They're getting close.
[162:11.33]They're getting closer than I am.
[162:13.91]The hidden mages.
[162:14.99]You follow the sound of screams and clashing metal to find a company of Empire soldiers tearing down tents and executing cowering mages.
[162:33.70]What do I got?
[162:34.60]Plus five food coming up here?
[162:37.86]That'll be nice.
[162:43.72]I like the way the sword looks.
[162:46.30]They are none so hated by the infantry as archers.
[162:48.97]Small wonder this weapon is prized by them.
[162:58.35]Oh, this weapon is quick, too.
[163:11.27]Right in the back.
[163:14.59]I gotta riposte more.
[163:18.03]Oop, can't dodge that.
[163:22.84]What's that ding-a-ling, huh, with the mages?
[163:40.46]What?
[163:40.68]You can block the riposte?
[163:43.22]Really?
[163:51.04]How good am I at drawing?
[163:52.40]Not at all.
[163:53.42]I'm actually pretty terrible.
[163:57.04]I have lots of trouble drawing stick figures, let alone anything else.
[163:59.26]I can't do it.
[164:01.00]The mages are grateful for your intervention.
[164:03.61]Alright, this... This is important.
[164:09.21]This tent village is well hidden in the sweeping snow and fog.
[164:12.33]You can spend time here in exchange for resources.
[164:18.01]Spend five days for one equipment card gain.
[164:22.22]Ask about the hermit.
[164:24.38]A mage draws a rune in the snow and says, The hermit enchanted the forest to protect us.
[164:30.66]I'm not sure how he does it.
[164:32.72]Perhaps blood magic.
[164:35.56]Talk about sharp tooth.
[164:37.72]A horrible little imp.
[164:40.44]God knows how he does it, but it's probably blood magic or something.
[164:46.36]Well, I'm not wasting days.
[164:52.97]Continue on your journey.
[164:56.53]The mages point you vaguely in the hermit's direction, even they are not certain of his whereabouts.
[165:01.92]Cross the silent river through the twin oaks.
[165:09.68]Empire is 10 days away.
[165:14.45]Mage hunting.
[165:15.99]I need food again.
[165:19.67]I need to... This is not good.
[165:26.58]I am in desperate need of getting another blizzard.
[165:45.75]For a second I got freaked out I am wearing a helmet for the first time the entire entirety owning the game Have I ever had a helmet on in like the 12 hours I put in this game like 10 hours I put in the game so far Shit
[166:08.20]Should have been more prepared for that one.
[166:16.39]Do it!
[166:17.57]Goodbye.
[166:29.32]The backgrounds in the first game were good, but now they are also pretty.
[166:34.69]Yeah, the improvements made on the just game engine itself and how everything looks.
[166:44.18]They spend a lot more time on the detail.
[166:46.38]Empire is a burden.
[166:48.66]Throw a bomb that causes 30 damage and slow to Empire enemies when activated.
[166:54.42]Or elusive charm.
[166:56.88]Escape from snare more easily.
[166:58.31]I mean, we're fighting Empire.
[167:03.10]Might as well just use it and equip it.
[167:06.45]This is where we have the Empire outfit on right now.
[167:13.71]Blizzard.
[167:14.07]Here we go.
[167:16.47]Empire falls behind by four days.
[167:18.24]Huge success again.
[167:22.82]I don't know where it is.
[167:24.06]I lost it.
[167:25.34]I lost it on the second pass.
[167:28.38]I would say it was one or two.
[167:30.04]For real.
[167:31.45]But I don't know.
[167:44.58]Well, I need to camp.
[167:49.86]Buy food.
[167:51.17]They only give you one food.
[167:53.51]Hey, chat.
[167:55.03]You see that plus five food?
[167:56.47]What's it gonna take for you guys to give that to me?
[168:02.09]What?
[168:04.73]Hold on.
[168:04.99]You're just selling that ring?
[168:06.51]Uh, yeah.
[168:09.83]I think I'll... This is the Quake one.
[168:12.21]Sell this.
[168:14.88]What is this?
[168:15.64]You're selling a legendary item.
[168:21.82]Optionally, nudge the result onto the next card during a wheel gambit.
[168:27.68]Oh.
[168:31.98]I don't know if I want that right now.
[168:34.50]That's not a big deal.
[168:36.60]There's been no wheels this whole time.
[168:40.40]Yeah, let's go.
[168:47.73]Take it.
[168:48.27]No, there's tons of money for... I haven't seen any wheels.
[168:55.16]It is a big deal.
[168:55.68]There are no wheels in this whole... Where are they?
[169:01.54]I haven't seen one this whole time.
[169:09.74]Devs, help me.
[169:11.20]No, don't... I made that decision.
[169:14.00]It's my decision.
[169:16.14]And I'm gonna stick to my guns.
[169:18.99]Yvonne's Cottage.
[169:19.69]By the side of a waterfall, you meet a young woman with striking gray hair.
[169:22.57]She's holding a baby.
[169:24.49]Greetings, traveler.
[169:25.71]Treat these waters with caution.
[169:27.58]They are not to be meddled with.
[169:29.64]If you're parched, you're welcome to stop by my cottage.
[169:32.52]I have a pie cooling on my windowsill, too.
[169:35.80]Behind her, a little wooden sign reads, Waterfall of Youth.
[169:39.62]Very dangerous.
[169:40.59]Stay clear.
[169:42.61]I am Yvonne, the woman says as she leads you to her cottage.
[169:46.36]As was promised, a hearty beef pie awaits you.
[169:49.91]You enjoy it with a side of mashed potatoes.
[169:54.59]Nice.
[169:56.03]With the meal finished, Yvonne asks you to help her while she puts the baby to sleep.
[170:00.47]The rare sunsheen flower grows nearby, and she'd like you to go gather a bloom.
[170:06.64]It feels impolite to refuse.
[170:11.28]The sunsheen sprouts from the rocks behind the waterfall.
[170:14.37]If you were careful, you could climb out to retrieve one without falling into the water.
[170:17.97]Let's try to get one.
[170:21.27]Remembering the warning, you inch your way along the rock wall, gingerly moving from stone to stone.
[170:29.82]Okay, this one didn't move.
[170:35.16]If I had failed that one, I don't know how it would have taken me a long time to live that one down.
[170:41.84]You manage to grab a ledge and regain your balance.
[170:44.80]From here, you reach Sunsheen, bag it, and make your way back to the shore.
[170:51.18]Yvonne is delighted to see the Sunsheen.
[170:53.37]Most travelers just eat it and leave.
[170:56.01]And thanks, she gives you a gift.
[170:58.25]This will protect you in your travels.
[171:01.45]Ten health.
[171:03.13]And the coin.
[171:07.86]No, she gives you a warm baguette.
[171:16.17]They're going to get there first.
[171:17.03]I don't know what to do here.
[171:21.23]Winter Trail.
[171:25.06]Five days away.
[171:28.08]Free food.
[171:29.30]A perilous chance.
[171:33.48]Further into the forest you hear a smattering of voices carried on the wind from somewhere to the east.
[171:38.00]You motion Estrella to stay behind carefully.
[171:41.25]You approach the voices and spy a small empire party taking a break from the zealous manhunt.
[171:47.03]Okay, I can stay hidden.
[171:54.04]Stay hidden.
[171:58.64]A soldier whistles and sits down.
[171:59.70]It's a good thing the captain thought to give us these shields.
[172:02.12]Don't steal the shield.
[172:05.62]Just stay.
[172:08.64]Continue to stay hidden.
[172:12.82]It's getting smaller.
[172:18.39]You have done well.
[172:19.27]Okay.
[172:20.27]You overhear the soldiers discussing a nearby landmark.
[172:26.01]Yeah.
[172:29.28]Unfortunately, another soldier approaches and the pair begin an animated conversation about their Kalas Day plans.
[172:37.32]Stay hidden.
[172:40.11]Oh, come on.
[172:40.79]I got like one grain of rice.
[172:45.51]Oh, boy.
[172:47.77]Come on.
[172:50.58]You overhear the soldiers discussing a nearby landmark.
[172:55.22]The Hidden Mages Blizzard.
[172:59.54]Do I want to do the Hidden Mages?
[173:05.63]I think I want to do that.
[173:12.27]Is that the one I want?
[173:14.58]Suddenly, a gruff voice gives the command to move out.
[173:16.96]You breathe a sigh of relief, and the last soldiers trudge away from your hiding place.
[173:23.05]That's the one I want, right?
[173:23.83]Mages.
[173:30.91]In a small clearing, you stumble across another group of exiled mages.
[173:34.68]After some insistence, they lower their guard.
[173:41.02]Ask about the hermit.
[173:42.94]A distracted mage waves his hand towards the forest without looking up from his readings.
[173:47.44]Yes, yes, yes.
[173:48.18]The hermit is that way.
[173:50.08]He doesn't often take visitors.
[173:51.42]I've never seen him anyway.
[173:54.10]God damn it.
[173:57.07]Are they going to find him?
[174:07.17]Continue on your journey.
[174:12.07]They just point you vaguely in the hermit's direction even they are not certain of his whereabouts.
[174:16.05]Stay fast to the path of bluebells.
[174:18.51]If you're at the Great Lake, you've gone too far.
[174:24.54]Holy shit, dude.
[174:27.16]What?
[174:32.95]Oh my god.
[174:34.09]How are you supposed to do this?
[174:39.09]A perilous chance.
[174:41.43]Again,
[174:43.37]Oh, I gotta be good here.
[174:44.95]This is the same thing where I have to stay hidden.
[174:56.10]Soldier Whistle sits down.
[174:56.98]It's a good thing the captain gave us these shields.
[175:01.04]No.
[175:01.88]Stay hidden.
[175:02.42]I need to find a landmark.
[175:05.36]Sometimes you gotta go instantly.
[175:08.65]Sometimes.
[175:11.07]Nearby landmark.
[175:13.52]A perilous chance.
[175:14.48]Again, I don't want to do that one again.
[175:16.32]Fuck.
[175:20.74]Come on.
[175:21.74]Give me that grain of rice.
[175:25.68]Oh, got it.
[175:28.06]Nicely timed.
[175:30.91]Nearby landmark.
[175:33.43]There's a blizzard over here on the left.
[175:36.75]I have two stops.
[175:38.19]I can do that one.
[175:38.85]It'll be four days.
[175:42.98]Without that, the run is over.
[175:47.51]Further in.
[175:49.17]Oh!
[175:51.31]They found him.
[175:52.03]He's dead.
[175:53.47]Wow, this one.
[175:54.31]This one is gonna be hard.
[176:08.51]From an indeterminate point in the forest, a sweep of green melts away all the trace of winter.
[176:12.06]You find yourself blinking in the heat of the summer sun.
[176:15.86]The cards fall with aim A. He is dead.
[176:20.02]There he was.
[176:23.94]Yowzers.
[176:25.34]Challenge failed.
[176:29.45]Wow.
[176:31.45]Well, that one sure is difficult.
[176:34.61]That's a lot of... That's 52 card pickup there.
[176:40.10]Just got a card out of it.
[176:42.46]This is for getting the Sun Sheen flowers perfectly.
[176:44.76]The Yvette's Cottage again.
[176:46.82]Interesting.
[176:49.15]It's playing Minesweeper.
[176:51.71]It really is.
[176:52.23]Okay.
[176:56.95]Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is going to wrap it up for me for tonight.
[177:04.54]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[177:08.26]uh in the two days in a row that I've played for about 10 like 10 plus 11 12 something probably like a little over 11 hours now uh absolute this is this is an absolute recommend go get this game it's very very fun and there's not even I'm not even like halfway through the content
[177:31.00]Because there is at least, let's see here.
[177:33.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[177:34.12]There's like at least maybe 15 more encounters that we haven't even seen.
[177:41.86]And with the completionist aspect of the game, the fact that you can get, obviously you can either complete it or do gold.
[177:48.39]It's less than $30.
[177:53.01]Give it a run.
[177:53.83]It's very hard, very unforgiving sometimes, but that's the nature of the cards.
[178:00.94]I would say this is much better than the first one.
[178:03.82]It's much more elaborate than the first one.
[178:05.72]And I loved the first one.
[178:09.47]So, with that, tomorrow, the PC build stream is going to be tomorrow.
[178:14.95]Just regular time, 7 o'clock.
[178:18.67]The normal time I will be ready.
[178:21.21]Which should be a lot of fun.
[178:22.63]At least I hope it is.
[178:24.85]It's not going to be a very long stream.
[178:28.21]I'm going to warn you on that.
[178:30.53]Once it is done, once that stream is done, I'm anticipating it'll probably be like, maybe like 45 minutes?
[178:39.16]Maybe an hour?
[178:40.18]Would be that stream.
[178:42.60]I'm building a PC in an hour.
[178:44.30]It's not gonna be that long.
[178:52.26]It'll be long enough where it's, you know, you watch me put parts in a computer.
[178:57.15]It's gonna be long.
[179:01.94]It's going to be an awful stream.
[179:03.72]You don't know that.
[179:04.56]I would show up tomorrow if you think that, baby.
[179:09.68]Anyways.
[179:11.16]Thank you for sticking around.
[179:12.88]There's a couple of bits that I missed from a few minutes ago here.
[179:16.84]If the dev of this game is still in the chat, that was a lot of fun.
[179:21.39]I very much enjoyed that.
[179:22.29]Thank you for doing that.
[179:24.91]It was cool to have you hang out for a while.
[179:30.40]bought it, you're really excited to play it.
[179:32.59]Yeah, you should.
[179:33.15]It's very good.
[179:37.97]No games after the PC build?
[179:39.21]It's probably not going to be possible for various reasons.
[179:45.36]Because it's a tough thing to build a PC.
[179:48.16]You have to use all your brain.
[179:50.62]You use your brain for more than 10 minutes?
[179:52.50]It's a little hard.
[179:54.54]Anywho, thank you.
[179:55.21]We're going to move over here now to...
[179:59.90]Say our goodbyes.
[180:01.90]Death Man Jones, thanks for the $1.
[180:05.96]Yo, this was a really fun stream.
[180:07.56]Also, if you do end up watching JoJo, I sincerely hope you enjoy it because it's one of my absolute favorite series of all time.
[180:13.91]Alright, now I'm going to watch the first episode.
[180:17.41]I'm just gonna watch it.
[180:19.45]We've been talking about it for a while now.

[180:48.93]Probably won't be Ben-level donations, though.

[180:53.01]No, don't feel bad about that.

[182:02.00]Just viewer in general is extraordinarily important.
[182:08.35]We talk about this a lot, but it's really true.
[182:15.69]Reverse, reverse psychology.
[182:22.08]Like, I will gladly accept money if you give it to me, but it's not a requirement for you to be here and enjoy hanging out here.
[182:31.71]And I don't want, I feel like some people be like, oh, fuck man, I like watched your channel for five years.
[182:38.21]I owe you five years worth of money.

[183:33.49]But I love you all.
[183:37.08]Don't worry about needing to shower me with gold coins or anything to make me feel any different towards you or think that you owe that to me.

[183:56.23]But... I'm glad that... That you're getting a job.
