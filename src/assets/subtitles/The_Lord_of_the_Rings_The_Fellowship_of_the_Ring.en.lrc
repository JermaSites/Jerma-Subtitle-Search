[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.87]So I'm sitting here, questioning a couple things about the state of media and how... Hear me out.
[00:11.50]So why is it that I can play The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring on PlayStation 2 with a bunch of cutscenes and all the fucking music
[00:27.76]But I can't watch The Fellowship of the Ring on Twitch.
[00:33.70]Why am I not allowed to do that?
[00:35.00]Why can I play The Fellowship of the Ring the game, but I can't watch The Fellowship of the Ring the movie?
[00:39.40]It's... I don't understand.
[00:41.67]Hold on, this thing... What happened to my fucking... My cord got all fucked up first.
[00:46.79]Aren't they under the same boat?
[00:51.35]Is it licensing?
[00:54.15]Alright, but okay, but if Shadow of War came out like two years ago... If I listen to the Hobbit song in Shadow of War... But then I play a clip of the Hobbit song on YouTube, my channel gets muted.
[01:19.08]That's weird.
[01:25.05]Because I don't understand.
[01:30.83]Your audio is sounding nice and crisp today.
[01:33.31]Ha, well.
[01:35.46]Look at you.
[01:37.08]We're playing Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring today.
[01:39.40]Because one person guaranteed I wouldn't get past the first level.
[01:42.64]So... That's what we're doing.
[01:50.71]I don't know why you would say that.
[01:51.95]Because I...
[01:53.91]Weirdly enough, my memory does not remember this one.
[02:00.83]Yeah, there it is.
[02:02.15]Lord of the Rings, you won't make it.
[02:03.17]Here we go.
[02:03.49]Just for context, for those of you that are curious.
[02:06.05]Here's the context here.
[02:10.05]You literally won't get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it.
[02:13.05]I wouldn't...
[02:16.65]Alright, I'm gonna remember your name, because when I get past level one in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking scream your name.
[02:23.54]Right.
[02:24.32]What was your name?
[02:26.30]Fake what?
[02:26.92]It comes into the hype train.
[02:28.52]Wait, I made this harder to do.
[02:30.84]I'm gonna write that next time.
[02:32.18]I increased it.
[02:32.58]Alright, well, here we go.
[02:33.94]Here we go again.
[02:35.26]When I get, when I'm done.
[02:37.73]Fake, alright, fake, fake Brumbo.
[02:39.73]Here comes the hype train.
[02:42.13]When I am done with...
[02:45.48]Thanks for the hype train, guys.
[02:47.98]Alright, three hype trains in three days.
[02:53.94]This is like, alright, when you go to... When you ride at Disney World, right?
[03:01.25]When you get on the hype train.
[03:03.49]And you ride the fucking new Star Wars ride.
[03:05.93]And it's like, holy shit, that was hype.
[03:07.63]That was insane.
[03:09.26]That was incredible.
[03:12.46]Oh my God, when Han Solo like flew by, dude, I shit my pants.
[03:16.77]Let's do it again.
[03:17.93]And you ride it again.
[03:20.07]On the third or fourth ride on the hype train, on the hype ride, you look up and you start to see where the fucking mechanical shit is.
[03:28.22]I, oh, wait.
[03:29.28]Oh, there's Han Solo.
[03:30.14]I can see the wire.
[03:31.74]I can see the wire up there and it's connected to an arm.
[03:35.86]Oh, hi, fuck.
[03:42.11]We're getting just too many hype trains.
[03:43.93]Alright, this is fucking ridiculous.
[03:47.59]Rusty bars.
[03:50.33]Oh, no, wait, hold on a minute.
[03:52.19]Is there a scratch on that LCD screen?
[03:56.22]Yeah, I didn't notice that on the first fucking hype.
[03:59.62]Ow.
[04:01.72]Gary, should we have rode this ride ten times in a row?
[04:07.04]Where are your kids?
[04:09.68]Uh...
[04:10.88]level three complete already level three here comes level four get on the hype train never get off never get off the hype train
[04:30.56]Already level 4.
[04:31.24]You guys are not fucking around today.
[04:32.93]We're just doing it.
[04:35.07]But, okay, that's my point with this whole thing is I gotta tweak some numbers on this because I don't want to ride the Han Solo ride 20 times in a row and every day I'm just sitting here, get hype for the hype train.
[04:47.30]There's Han Solo.
[04:49.76]There he goes.
[04:50.84]Yeah.
[04:52.46]Get hype.
[04:54.32]Oh, fuck, you've given me so much money in four days.
[04:59.35]I don't want it to be, like, just the going through the motions thing for me.
[05:02.61]I'm gonna tweak the numbers.
[05:03.95]I'm gonna make it harder to do.
[05:06.53]Well, see, I thought I already did that, but you guys are fucking... You guys are so generous.
[05:12.64]That, like, even if I keep making this harder to do, you're probably still gonna do it.
[05:17.98]You're still gonna do it.
[05:23.82]Get hype or else.
[05:26.08]Oh, man.
[05:30.27]thanks guys seriously this is fucking too much there's a lot of the rings alright you did hype you did it hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype thank you guys seriously level four oh dude there's only five minutes to get this train out of the station
[06:02.88]four minutes and 30 seconds remain what the let's go start it dude 27 28 come on man we can do this we can do this three days in a row
[06:35.34]It's like, that's gonna get my VOD muted.
[06:37.04]This is, okay, this is mute the VOD day.
[06:47.34]We got Lord of the Rings music, Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring in the background.
[06:50.83]We've got a hype train getting on the ride again, and it's gonna complete, and it's gonna keep going.
[06:56.43]We like to party.
[06:57.53]We like to party more.
[06:58.77]I can't even fucking keep up, man.
[07:00.47]This is insane.
[07:03.66]Oh, my fucking god.
[07:04.82]Get out of that hype train.
[07:08.38]Hey, Elinor, $50.
[07:11.06]I like this video game.
[07:12.50]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[07:13.44]Thanks for completing the hype train.
[07:35.21]Should I just play this song?
[07:38.08]Should I just play this song and that's it?
[07:39.76]And that's what we do.
[07:41.04]And we just ride the hype train and then we get off.
[07:46.66]It's too loud?
[07:47.30]Alright, hold on.
[07:49.95]I just... Let me just be very, very... Did somebody say that the Venga Boys was too loud?
[07:59.35]Um...
[08:01.12]The Vengaboys are only allowed to be played at an audio level of at least 7 out of 10.
[08:08.51]If you play the Vengaboys under a 5 out of 10 in volume, your computer explodes.
[08:15.03]It's like Speed.
[08:17.19]The movie with Keanu Reeves.
[08:24.03]100 dB.
[08:25.33]Anyways, we did it.
[08:26.35]You did it again.
[08:29.88]You did it again.
[08:30.66]You did it again.
[08:32.20]You fucking... You blew through another, like, three, five hundred subs, or whatever it was.
[08:38.58]What is it?
[08:38.96]Let's see what it completes.
[08:39.96]It tells us.
[08:44.76]Play the song.
[08:47.46]You're getting the song.
[08:48.52]Actually, this is kind of the royalty-free version of Fellowship of the Ring, isn't it?
[08:54.59]It is.
[08:56.71]This is not really Fellowship of the Ring, so now I understand why I can play it.
[09:02.77]Where's Jon Snow?
[09:03.97]Wrong franchise.
[09:06.59]You're thinking of Game of Thrones.
[09:12.71]Where's Jon Snow?
[09:18.35]Toss a coin to the streamer.
[09:21.45]Oh my fucking god.
[09:27.28]Another 5,000 bits from numb legs.
[09:31.04]They say hype in all capitals Fucking man, I'm making that goddamn movie.
[09:39.43]I'm making that movie Here's the part about this though all the projects that are like in the pipeline now became
[09:52.23]Like, I just fed all of my Pokémon that, like, magic fruit that makes them all stronger.
[09:57.64]You know, I've got, like, 10 Pokémon in my Pokédex thing, and I just gave them all the magic fruit that makes them, like, 20% stronger, whatever it is.
[10:04.41]What's it called?
[10:05.93]Rare Candy, that's right.
[10:08.13]You guys just gave Rare Candy to, like, the four projects that are coming up in the next, like, three, four months.
[10:20.52]There it is.
[10:21.86]You achieved a hype level of level 5.
[10:25.07]You did it.
[10:26.17]Let's get the Vengaboys on here to show just how fucking hype that was.
[10:29.93]129 subs, 23,000 bits.
[10:32.67]Jesus Christ, guys.
[10:33.49]And in the first 10 minutes of the stream.
[10:45.50]You guys are too much.
[10:48.80]Thanks for sprinkling rare candy all over all my fucking Pokémon videos that are coming out.
[10:52.68]Or streams, you know.
[10:59.60]Anyway.
[11:01.78]Let's play Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring.
[11:03.90]We'll go over all those at the end of the stream like we always do.
[11:08.02]But holy shit.
[11:11.62]Hive is over.
[11:12.36]Back to sleep.
[11:13.18]New game.
[11:14.56]Lord of the Rings.
[11:20.53]Uh, okay.
[11:21.39]I was gonna say, hopefully he doesn't hang.
[11:24.33]He's playing the game.
[11:25.13]Wake me up when he's not.
[11:27.03]We're gonna get a cutscene, I think, here.
[11:30.73]Is it the actors?
[11:31.41]Is it the original actors?
[11:34.60]We'll find out.
[11:35.02]Hello?
[11:45.10]Hello?
[11:52.13]The old PlayStation 2 buzzing sound.
[11:56.21]Here we go.
[12:00.30]That's the Harry Potter memory thing.
[12:05.96]In the shadows of Mordor, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the One Ring to enslave all elves, dwarves, and men of Middle-Earth.
[12:17.44]The free people of Middle-Earth overthrew Sauron, but lost the Ring.
[12:27.55]Now the enemy has returned.
[12:29.57]And from his dark tower in Morkdor, he seeks his ring.
[12:34.64]We must find the ring first and destroy it.
[12:37.96]Who is that supposed to be?
[12:41.10]Don't... I should know this.
[12:44.60]The weak would be corrupted.
[12:46.56]Uh... Dan... Dandryl?
[12:51.07]Dandryl.
[12:52.29]Gabriel?
[12:52.91]Gabriel?
[12:55.01]No, not Gabriel.
[12:56.67]Gala... Galileo.
[13:02.03]I don't know that... I don't know.
[13:03.53]I'm such a fucking shitty fan.
[13:04.85]I don't know her name.
[13:07.19]Not Gandalf.
[13:08.99]Why are there no subtitles?
[13:15.43]Galadriel.
[13:18.38]Welcome back, Gandalf.
[13:19.88]Will we have fireworks?
[13:21.34]Elvish lessons?
[13:22.42]Tales of ancient Numenor?
[13:24.22]Today, we must talk about a shadow of the past.
[13:27.58]The ring you inherited may be very dangerous.
[13:29.72]Is that Ian McKellen?
[13:30.47]Uncle Bilbo's magic ring?
[13:32.49]Magic rings, as you call them, were made by elves.
[13:36.87]But this ring, I think, was made by another.
[13:40.99]Give me the ring.
[13:45.54]That looks like the Christian Bible game show host.
[13:50.27]See, Frodo, it was that easy.
[13:51.93]You just gotta toss it into some fire.
[13:55.05]Let me save you 16 hours worth of movies.
[13:58.13]I see fine lines.
[14:01.29]Lines of fire in a flowing script.
[14:05.10]What does it say?
[14:06.54]One ring to rule them all.
[14:08.70]One ring to find them.
[14:10.44]One ring to bring them all.
[14:12.68]And in the darkness, bind them.
[14:15.86]This is the one ring to rule them all.
[14:19.35]The ancient kings of elves, dwarves, and men used the rings of power to rule their lands.
[14:25.93]See, I don't have to pay attention to this cutscene because I already know this.
[14:29.97]Oh, dude, pay attention to the cutscene.
[14:31.81]We've already seen this movie.
[14:33.45]A strange creature called Gollum found the ring and was corrupted by it.
[14:38.44]Bilbo won it from Gollum and now it is yours.
[14:41.04]So is this just the movie?
[14:42.62]But the Lord of the Rings has returned and all his thought is bent on finding the ring.
[14:49.07]Let's destroy it.
[14:50.99]It can only be destroyed when it was forged in Mount Doom, the fire mountain in Mordor.
[14:56.22]Tidal drop.
[14:57.30]Take it there.
[14:58.36]Take it.
[14:59.20]No, do not tempt me.
[15:01.30]If I bore the ring, I would become the Dark Lord himself.
[15:04.88]Gandalf, it's not like a piece of chocolate while you're on a diet.
[15:08.95]No, don't tempt me with that.
[15:10.43]Oh, is that chocolate cake?
[15:11.55]Oh, but it looks so delicious.
[15:13.77]I'm a danger to the Shire.
[15:15.93]I must leave.
[15:18.51]I could set out on the road just like Bilbo.
[15:21.24]My dear Frodo, hobbits really are amazing creatures.
[15:26.05]But you need not go alone.
[15:27.69]If there are any you can trust.
[15:29.91]But take care.
[15:31.43]The enemy has many spies.
[15:34.59]Uh-oh.
[15:36.47]What was in the window?
[15:37.45]I didn't look in the window.
[15:38.31]Did you look in the window?
[15:39.11]What?
[15:42.32]Well then.
[15:43.54]Samwise Gamgee, isn't it?
[15:46.62]Don't hurt me!
[15:48.72]What are you doing at Bag End?
[15:51.27]Nothing, sir.
[15:52.31]I'm trimming the grass under the window.
[15:54.95]Oh?
[15:55.91]The sound of shears stopped some time ago.
[15:58.25]Bootleg Lord of the Rings.
[15:59.39]We're just watching the Lord of the Rings on stream.
[16:02.42]Finally.
[16:03.34]I get to live my fucking fantasy.
[16:06.22]What have you heard?
[16:09.98]Frodo, don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
[16:13.27]He won't hurt you.
[16:14.41]Just answer his question.
[16:16.31]Well, I heard a lot I didn't understand about lords and rings and a fiery mountain.
[16:22.57]And elves, sir.
[16:23.81]I had to listen.
[16:24.85]I dearly love to see elves.
[16:28.38]Were they?
[16:29.04]Keep it a secret, Sam.
[16:30.78]Or I hope Gandalf turned you into a spotted toad.
[16:33.66]I've thought of something better.
[16:35.06]Why don't they shave their feet?
[16:36.12]We will go away with you, Frodo.
[16:38.78]Me, sir?
[16:39.90]Go and see elves and all?
[16:41.46]Hooray!
[16:42.82]But where should we go?
[16:44.66]Towards danger, but not too rashly.
[16:47.18]Just grab like a wax strip and just... Take time to settle your affairs before you leave.
[16:54.26]Could leave an autumn on my birthday very well, but how come that wasn't like a 40 year old virgin Part of these movies where Frodo gets like his feet Every time they rip it off I'll have to sell bag end the sackville bagginses have been trying to take over this place for years a Shame to let them have it
[17:17.30]Indeed.
[17:18.74]And now I must go.
[17:20.76]I have much to attend to.
[17:22.66]How about that would ruin these fucking movies?
[17:25.78]That would ruin everything.
[17:28.28]They would not get nominated for any Academy Awards across the entire three movies.
[17:32.02]Oh, yes.
[17:33.16]Not a word from Sam Gamgee.
[17:35.00]And that's for certain.
[17:36.12]Once you leave, travel as Mr. Underhill.
[17:38.78]The name of Baggins is not safe outside the Shire.
[17:42.16]And do not use the ring, for it can corrupt the most innocent heart.
[17:49.15]I understand.
[17:49.77]Gandalf, how do you use the ring?
[17:51.87]Elves!
[17:55.57]I'm going to see elves!
[17:56.85]Farewell, Frodo.
[17:58.93]I'll return by your birthday.
[18:01.92]My birthday, but again, I'm gonna get not Gandalf's coming to my birthday party longer I decided you guys might have to leave your game.
[18:08.36]I'll come to your birthday birthday September 22nd I said one final stroll around the Shire Farewell to my wife's and sell my home.

[18:25.59]That's my birthday.
[18:26.81]Oh
[18:37.64]Gandalf, just come to my fucking birthday party.
[18:40.30]Not yours.
[18:48.73]He could be making it up though.
[18:52.27]Alright, let's go.
[18:54.01]Happy birthday.
[18:54.89]Gandalf's coming to my birthday party.
[18:57.86]Oh, I have to get ready.
[19:08.35]You picked a Bag End key.
[19:09.61]Get the key to Bag End.
[19:10.57]Press and hold R2 to view Frodo's inventory.
[19:13.79]Use the left analog stick to scroll through Frodo's inventory.
[19:18.02]Walking stick.
[19:21.72]You can punch and you can hit.
[19:22.94]Alright, so I got the key to Bag End.
[19:34.99]Anything else I need to do?
[19:42.55]Stick in bag end.
[19:48.39]Shut up.
[19:49.21]Alright, let's go.
[19:51.57]I got the key.
[19:56.27]Wait, I don't want to miss any secrets.
[19:58.33]What, hey, by the way, what qualifies as the first part of Lord of the Rings?
[20:04.21]Fellowship of the Ring.
[20:08.25]Getting out of the house here.
[20:09.03]This is the first level.
[20:10.05]Just getting out of the house.
[20:24.30]Find the deed to bag in before leaving.
[20:26.20]Oh, shit.
[20:27.30]Is there a sprint?
[20:35.25]This is a fucking ugly-ass game.
[20:48.11]Yes, I know.
[20:48.69]It is PlayStation 2.
[20:49.97]I know.
[20:51.11]But it's pretty ugly.
[20:53.10]He's gonna quit it.
[20:54.96]He's gonna quit.
[20:56.02]Oh, no.
[20:56.96]No, I'm not gonna quit.
[20:58.28]I can't... He sells his house?
[21:01.84]I don't... Wait, hold on.
[21:03.00]Frodo sells his house in Fellowship of the Ring?
[21:09.96]Where's the deed to the house?
[21:18.97]You never watched the movie.
[21:20.09]Yes, I did.
[21:20.63]I don't remember them being a house sale.
[21:27.50]You didn't read the books.
[21:30.42]No, I didn't read the books!
[21:33.06]Because... Where's his deed?
[21:44.37]the movies were so good that I couldn't read the books okay I'll be I'm gonna be honest the movies were too good so I could not read the books hold on a second let me just do something here
[22:13.08]I think I can turn the brightness up a little bit or something.
[22:15.20]Something's wrong.
[22:16.82]It looks, like, shitty and crusty.
[22:18.97]I think that just might be the game.
[22:20.63]Let me see if I can tweak this.
[22:21.81]Hold on.
[22:33.09]I'm not cheating.
[22:34.45]Alright, here we go.
[22:40.04]Is that better or worse?
[22:40.98]I can't even tell.
[22:42.16]That's like worse.
[22:42.93]Oh, there we go.
[22:50.41]That's a little better.
[23:00.76]Is it worse?
[23:01.22]Do we saturate the colors a little more?
[23:08.62]Alright, now we're looking okay.
[23:12.96]Now it doesn't look like total dog shit.
[23:19.08]Maybe drop the contrast a little?
[23:20.63]Put the gamma down.
[23:25.47]Gamma down, sharpness up, brightness up.
[23:30.03]I don't have access to those.
[23:34.11]That looks better.
[23:34.65]That looks alright right there.
[23:41.88]Oof.
[23:43.22]Looks like I put the ring on.
[23:44.16]Alright, let me walk around for a second.
[23:50.36]Oh, yeah, that's like a thousand times better.
[23:53.76]Before, it was like it hurt my head.
[23:56.72]That's so much better.
[23:57.48]Alright, let's close this back down.
[24:06.51]Am I playing this in a bathtub?
[24:11.74]Yes.
[24:13.14]Yes, I'm in a bathtub right now.
[24:15.10]I'm playing in a bathtub.
[24:16.49]I bathe and play.
[24:17.91]That's how I game.
[24:18.83]That's how you know that I'm... I take it dead seriously.
[24:22.53]Oh, but I have a question.
[24:25.15]I was scared to do this and I didn't know.
[24:28.52]Okay, let me ask.
[24:29.36]This is a real question.
[24:30.80]Because how does electricity even work?
[24:33.42]So, if I... If I bring... Let's say, for instance, if somebody was to hypothetically...
[24:41.16]If you were to, like, be in a bathtub, right?
[24:43.09]Like, if you were taking a bath, and you wanted to... Oh, I have, like, my phone with me.
[24:47.01]Or my iPad.
[24:48.35]Right?
[24:50.25]If you have your iPad in the bath, if you drop the iPad into the bathtub, is it gonna electrocute you?
[25:02.21]No, right?
[25:06.19]No.
[25:06.95]Because there's no current.
[25:08.73]That's...
[25:13.68]There has to be a current, yeah.
[25:15.96]Because there's no, like, current to, like, a... Yeah, okay.
[25:19.59]Oh, that's correct?
[25:20.91]Yeah.
[25:24.53]Because I was taking a bath, and I was like, I want to use my iPad, but what if I, like, slip and drop the iPad into the bath?
[25:30.13]Am I going to get, like, fucking killed?
[25:32.18]I was scared.
[25:41.60]The amp is just too low.
[25:44.36]I don't know.
[25:44.84]It's like, okay, what if you dropped it?
[25:46.64]Listen.
[25:47.48]What if, okay.
[25:48.92]An iPad won't do it.
[25:50.22]But what if you had, like, a big fucking, like, Alienware laptop that has, like, an i7 in it?
[25:57.35]And it's like a $3,000 laptop if you dropped it into the bathtub.
[26:02.30]Would that still do it?
[26:03.66]No.
[26:20.04]Where's this deed?
[26:20.84]Where's this deed so I can tell this person that I beat the first part?
[26:24.32]Alright, I'm gonna check every fucking room.
[26:28.07]We're at the end of the hallway.
[26:30.61]This way.
[26:32.31]Okay, is it in here?
[26:34.37]In the dining room.
[26:40.44]Not in the dining room.
[26:42.20]Nothing sparkly to look at.
[26:53.86]There's nothing in here.
[26:55.04]Okay.
[26:56.44]Next room.
[26:57.98]This one right here.
[27:01.04]No deed?
[27:03.80]No deed?
[27:04.66]Okay, found the deed.
[27:08.69]Complete.
[27:09.15]I got it.
[27:11.09]Hey, fake Grumbo, if you're here, I'm about to fucking yell your name really loud.
[27:27.76]I actually can't get out of the house.
[27:35.82]Hey, I beat the first- this is not the first level, never mind.
[27:43.74]Imagine dropping a whole laptop in the bath.
[27:47.14]What's with the line?
[27:47.76]There's like weird scan lines right now.
[27:50.20]Do you see that?
[27:59.92]Good morning to you, Mr. Frodo.
[28:04.41]Good morning, Sam.
[28:05.91]All ready to set out for Buckland?
[28:07.65]Already?
[28:08.07]Or will be as soon as I tend to Bag End.
[28:10.59]Lobelia Sackville Baggins is buying the place.
[28:13.33]You don't need to weed Bag End ever again.
[28:15.89]I'd like to weed them Sackville Bagginses out of Bag End.
[28:19.27]If you get my meaning.
[28:20.24]What?
[28:21.33]Bag End has the best garden in the Shire, thanks to your work.
[28:24.71]This game is dated as fuck.
[28:27.16]This game sucks, actually, is what you... Wait, but hold on a minute.
[28:29.54]Um...
[28:56.53]What the two towers is like one of the best games ever made what happened I hate this camera is so stupid Okay, let's keep going oh
[29:23.12]No, I can't.
[29:23.58]I can't.
[29:23.86]I can't.
[29:24.10]I'm not stopping.
[29:24.74]Mushroom.
[29:25.12]Okay.
[29:44.33]Hi, Milo.
[29:44.57]I have to complete the first mission.
[29:45.81]I know, that's the... I'm gonna... Somebody fucking...
[30:09.92]Guaranteed that I wouldn't do the first level.
[30:13.80]They guaranteed it.
[30:14.68]I can't let that person win.
[30:21.44]Where do I go?
[30:21.88]I gotta go find Merry and Pippin.
[30:28.80]What is it?
[30:29.34]By the garden or something?
[30:33.40]How Fast Hornblower, number six.
[30:36.22]These people's names?
[30:42.32]Alright, we're out here?
[30:49.83]You probably should have let them win.
[30:53.41]No!
[31:00.47]Is there... Alright, is there a game here?
[31:02.53]Or do I just have to play as a hobbit?
[31:05.81]Don't we traverse mountains and shit?
[31:08.57]Aren't there like big battle sequences?
[31:10.69]What happened in the first movie?
[31:18.21]Right hold on here we go Hello Ted I wanted to say goodbye before I can't you see I'm busy Actually, it was a Ted seem to be just standing about well if you knew about news, you know I'm trying to locate a very important metal pin that must have fallen out of my new wheel Is that why the mill isn't working?
[31:43.30]I have to
[31:43.94]Oh, I thought I... Wait.
[31:44.80]I have to go get... A metal pin next to the... Holy shit.
[32:10.33]Uh... Imagine having a movie that was made with like 150 to 200 million dollars... And your tie-in video game for one of the most celebrated franchises ever in the history of human cinema and human literature... Is find the pin to the fucking watermill.
[32:33.32]Alright, where's that mill?
[32:40.68]This isn't based on the movie.
[32:51.10]It's not?
[32:54.88]Yes, it is.
[32:56.00]Official game based on the literary works of J.R.R.
[32:59.70]Tolkien.
[33:00.83]I call bullshit on that because look at the costumes!
[33:04.99]This is the same, like, this is Peter Jackson costume design.
[33:08.43]What?
[33:14.38]Like, Peter Jackson designed this cape!
[33:17.56]What do you mean, no, it's not?
[33:19.90]That's Ian McKellen's Gandalf!
[33:29.45]No, what?
[33:30.17]The costumes are described in the books.
[33:32.71]No, I'm telling you, we're gonna get... I'm telling you, no, this is based on the fucking movie?
[33:39.71]This... Bullshit.
[33:43.89]Fellowship of the Ring.
[33:46.43]When did it come out?
[33:48.81]What, you just magically decided to- Oh, you just magically, less than six months later after the movie comes out, you decide, we're gonna make a game based on the literary works of the Fellowship of the Ring.
[34:00.58]Four and a half months after the fucking movie comes out.
[34:03.68]Bullshit.
[34:16.58]You can't develop a game in six months.
[34:18.27]Alright.
[34:19.29]One guy's not winning.
[34:21.19]I'm going to do this right now.
[34:24.39]Peter Jackson based the film on this game.
[34:32.09]I have to... Alright.
[34:32.81]Let's go.
[34:33.51]Come on.
[34:34.13]I have to get to the first level.
[34:35.69]Nope.
[34:35.95]Nope.
[34:36.13]Nope.
[34:36.29]Nope.
[34:36.51]I refuse.
[34:36.99]This is why they said it.
[34:39.81]It had nothing to do with the game being hard.
[34:46.04]Fuck.
[34:46.74]I thought it was like, dude, the game's too hard for you.
[34:48.90]Like, the combo meter, you're gonna fuck it up.
[34:50.46]Like, that's in the second and third game.
[34:52.04]I get it now.
[34:52.54]Now I know why he said that.
[34:53.92]I just skipped dialog in the first... Alright, let's go.
[34:55.98]Get hive.
[35:15.92]Ah, yes, my favorite Lord of the Rings character.
[35:18.20]Minto!
[35:21.25]Yes, I know.
[35:22.21]This is... It's okay.
[35:26.17]You're right.
[35:26.83]Yeah, Minto.
[35:27.61]This person isn't even in the movie.
[35:29.53]Got it.
[35:41.64]Wait.
[35:43.46]This is my house.
[35:52.53]Where are you going?
[35:53.40]I don't know.
[35:54.24]I have to go find Merry and Pippin in the garden.
[35:57.70]Where's the garden?
[36:03.56]Fellowship with a fucking ring.
[36:05.40]Oh, I found the well.
[36:08.02]Ladders can be climbed.
[36:09.55]Sure.
[36:10.05]Oh, I wonder how quick my legs would break if I were to fucking fall straight down to the bottom.
[36:14.13]How do I do it?
[36:26.41]Got it.
[36:30.74]Frodo can grab ledges and hoist himself onto them.
[36:33.20]Jump to- What?
[36:33.98]He- There's a- Okay.
[36:36.22]Well, that worked.
[36:39.86]Got the default pig sound.
[36:40.86]That's pretty hype.
[36:44.06]There's- Okay, wait.
[36:44.90]What?
[36:45.20]There's only a mushroom up here?
[36:46.67]Is this a bootleg copy?
[36:51.37]No, no.
[36:52.27]This is a real copy.
[36:55.10]The game was just not... No fucking way.
[37:02.81]No, yes way!
[37:04.61]What does this have on, like, ratings?
[37:06.59]Alright, if I just splatted and I died and I got a game over screen, that would have been very, very funny.
[37:20.38]Click the link, omega LOL.
[37:21.56]Click the link, omega LOL.
[37:22.64]Click the link, omega LOL.
[37:24.16]Alright, hold on, what is it?
[37:28.72]Hobbit Day.
[37:29.66]Hobbit Day is the name used for September 20th in reference to being the birthday of the hobbits.
[37:33.14]Fuck.
[37:35.40]What am I- I can't- How am I supposed to say about this?
[37:46.64]I can't even combat this.
[37:48.52]It's not fair.
[37:49.28]That's not fair.
[37:50.74]That's not fair.
[37:52.92]That's not fair.
[37:58.76]That's not fair.
[38:00.31]Life isn't fair, okay?
[38:07.45]Wax you?
[38:08.43]How hairy are they?
[38:11.29]They're a little hairy.
[38:12.53]They're a little hairy.
[38:27.30]Oh, show, show!
[38:28.29]You think I'm gonna get baited?
[38:32.35]What, you think I'm gonna get baited?
[38:34.67]To, like, be in somebody's permanent folder on their desktop?
[38:45.88]Oh, dude, yeah, you should show!
[38:47.06]Oh, I wonder how rare they are!
[38:48.64]Click that, click that!
[38:49.40]Yes!
[38:50.24]Yes, I got it!
[38:51.97]Oh, yes!
[38:53.94]Okay, hold on.
[38:54.50]Calm down.
[38:55.52]Calm down, Frank.
[38:56.92]Calm down, Frank.
[38:57.51]You just got it.
[38:58.89]Okay, now save permanently to computer.
[39:02.93]Okay, save permanently.
[39:06.23]Make two copies of it.
[39:07.09]Okay.
[39:08.71]Oh, yes!
[39:10.67]I can watch this every... I can watch this every day.
[39:13.23]I can watch it every single day.
[39:14.51]I'm not getting dated.
[39:18.93]I'm not fucking dying.
[39:20.84]He's stalling.
[39:26.18]I don't... Okay, where's the garden?
[39:29.32]I don't care about these little quests.
[39:30.80]I don't want to just go meet the other people in the movie.
[39:34.29]In the book, whatever.
[39:35.15]Oh, Merry and Pippin are in the garden.
[39:42.69]What?
[39:42.91]Where's the garden?
[39:43.87]What garden?
[39:48.96]And where was the metal stick I have to find?
[39:54.36]I don't even have a map either.
[39:55.56]This is the I'm about to grapple.
[40:04.83]Okay.
[40:12.12]Why do I keep hearing cat puke noises?
[40:14.40]I don't know.
[40:20.51]Guys, I don't think you understand.
[40:30.26]What's the over-under on like the- Oh dude, like show!
[40:32.62]Hey!
[40:33.04]Sweat check!
[40:34.08]Sweat check!
[40:34.78]Oh yeah, let's do a sweat check!
[40:36.25]Hey!
[40:36.67]Got it!
[40:38.41]What's the over-under?
[40:47.48]through the game.
[41:09.20]That's a garden, right here.
[41:13.42]Found him.
[41:15.43]Let's go.
[41:19.27]Why can't I talk?
[41:19.75]Goddammit.
[41:22.65]I can't let this person be right.
[41:35.07]I guarantee... I guarantee you're not gonna get through the first part of Fellowship of the Rainbow PlayStation 2.
[41:45.16]Guaranteed.
[41:46.18]Fucking... They can't be right.
[41:48.62]They can't be right.
[41:49.66]They can't be right.
[41:51.37]They can't be right.
[41:54.45]There's... They can't be right.
[41:56.09]I can't.
[41:57.35]You can't win.
[41:59.09]I can't win.
[41:59.57]I have to find a metal stick.
[42:07.02]Next to the old water mill.
[42:09.54]But where is the old water mill?
[42:10.93]He said, you'll never find it.
[42:13.43]You're never gonna find the metal pin needed for this.
[42:15.96]I guarantee it.
[42:17.52]And he looks right in the fucking camera and winks at you guys.
[42:25.13]Hello there, Hal.
[42:26.39]Oh, hello, Frodo.
[42:28.13]You have a beautiful day to begin your trip to Crick Hollow.
[42:31.77]Yes, indeed.
[42:32.99]I'm too old for such long walks.
[42:35.73]I can't even climb high enough to fix my weather vane.
[42:38.71]No.
[42:39.17]What's wrong with it?
[42:40.33]The thing's stuck.
[42:41.85]Sorry to hear it.
[42:43.03]That rascal Sancho Proudfoot was throwing sticks at it.
[42:47.32]Now it won't turn at all.
[42:48.90]I'll take a look at it before I leave.
[42:50.66]I just threw up.
[42:51.18]It's been 45 minutes and I have to fucking do this now.
[42:53.38]The ladder's right over there.
[42:55.70]Ladder.
[42:55.94]Let's go.
[42:59.68]Throw a rocket.
[43:00.72]What?
[43:05.49]Let's go.
[43:05.81]Come on.
[43:11.21]Enter target mode.
[43:11.97]Press L2 and use the analog stick to aim.
[43:21.82]I'm not tall enough to aim at this.
[43:23.82]Wait.
[43:28.82]How do I throw a rock?
[43:31.52]I don't have any rocks.
[43:51.18]Where do I get a rock?
[43:54.22]I don't have rocks.
[43:56.08]Is there a rock like right next to it or something?
[44:02.48]Throw a rock?
[44:09.82]Did he... Wait a minute.
[44:11.22]Are these rocks just sitting right next to it or something?
[44:24.57]Is one... Where is there a... I have to find a rock and come back here and throw it.
[44:33.23]Oy oy oy.
[44:35.55]Holy shit, follow the road.
[44:37.63]Please, for the love of God, go to the next area.
[44:44.90]Okay, find a rock.
[44:45.64]I have to find the pin.
[45:00.43]Can't Gandalf just fucking help me do this?
[45:05.19]Gandalf is waiting at the end of the road Alright, seriously, where's the rock?
[45:09.01]This is... I don't understand
[45:36.82]Don't- Stop walking in circles.
[45:38.33]There is nowhere else to go!
[45:40.09]Guy!
[45:41.63]There's nowhere else to go!
[45:53.37]Minto is a minor character.
[45:54.78]I don't- I don't care!
[45:56.34]I need to find a rock.
[46:02.19]and the pin, and... This book sucks.
[46:17.64]This book sucks.
[46:20.36]Garden... If there's an item on the ground that's able to be picked up, it glows.
[46:28.35]Stay on the road, Jerma.
[46:29.27]Stay on the road.
[46:29.77]Stay on the road.
[46:30.33]Okay, I'm gonna stay on the road.
[46:31.41]Only on road.
[46:32.21]Only.
[46:38.14]Here we are again.
[47:01.63]the bridge to Bywater, the same path Bilbo took when he began his adventure long ago.
[47:06.47]Wait, can I just leave?
[47:24.42]Oh, I thought I had to do the quests
[47:29.06]You just walk out.
[47:30.84]I thought that was like, oh, find my... That has to be the first level.
[47:43.93]The Shire.
[47:44.55]Bywater.
[47:49.05]Holy fuck.
[47:49.95]I can't believe I just did that.
[47:51.09]I thought I had to do all that stuff.
[47:53.35]Turns out I didn't.
[47:54.62]Was that all just a joke?
[48:10.48]I'm gonna be realistic with you guys.
[48:13.46]Do you honestly think a hobbit with a stick is gonna do a goddamn thing?
[48:19.92]Give me a knife or something.
[48:21.34]Or give me like a gun.
[48:24.18]Give me something sharp.
[48:25.60]A hobbit with a stick.
[48:28.54]That's not gonna do anything.
[48:35.63]Or like a bow.
[48:36.23]I don't know.
[48:36.57]Anything.
[48:44.48]Will I see another springtime festival around this maypole?
[48:47.20]I don't know, will I?
[48:49.66]Stay on the road.
[48:51.29]What about the guy playing chess?
[48:52.35]Hello, young Baggins.
[48:53.85]Cheers on your birthday.
[48:55.77]Thank you kindly, Daddy Two-Foot.
[48:57.43]I haven't seen your wizard friend about lately.
[49:00.37]I do miss those fireworks.
[49:02.57]So do I. I remember the day when all those dwarves came to call on Mr. Bilbo.
[49:08.39]Dwarves and a wizard.
[49:10.15]I'm sorry, it's automatic.
[49:11.64]I have to do it.
[49:12.20]Alright, that's enough out of you.
[49:13.24]I don't care.
[49:13.58]Ring the bell?
[49:33.37]Oh.
[49:33.45]Okay.
[49:33.61]Alright, bye.
[49:34.69]Okay, Gandalf, I'm ready.
[49:35.47]Okay, hey, Gandalf, I'm ready.
[50:06.50]This is the way that I came.
[50:14.24]No?
[50:14.54]Yes.
[50:15.36]Is it the way that I came?
[50:16.22]He's so bad.
[50:19.85]What a little dick boy.
[50:21.27]Alright, dude.
[50:24.67]No?
[50:32.13]Did I come this way?
[50:34.81]I did.
[50:35.13]Didn't I?
[50:38.83]Yeah, I did.
[50:39.23]No, I didn't.
[50:40.99]Wait, is this guy again?
[50:41.79]That does kind of look like the Jerm of pain in your face.
[51:06.94]I don't care.
[51:07.52]Find four healing herbs in Green Hill Country for old noaks.
[51:11.74]How about we find Gandalf?
[51:14.43]The guy that I'm supposed to find.
[51:30.80]You're ignoring side quests.
[51:33.94]I'm not.
[51:34.36]Why would I do the side quests in this game?
[51:47.33]The Shire.
[51:47.81]Green Hill Country.
[51:52.61]Okay, what we got?
[51:53.36]When are we gonna get to hear the... Great.
[52:05.88]Yep.
[52:06.06]It's me, Frodo, not Bilbo.
[52:07.30]That's my dad.
[52:08.54]Uncle, uncle.
[52:09.08]I know it's uncle stuff.
[52:11.08]Okay, bye.
[53:03.52]Fucking good devs good devs.
[53:05.51]Good devs.
[53:06.21]Nice work guys.
[53:07.62]Give it up for the devs good devs
[53:25.41]Dev's not in chat.
[53:27.43]Oh.
[53:29.17]Oh, shit.
[53:30.71]Wait, I'm streaming a game and the dev is not here watching me stream?
[53:39.51]Like, what the... Really?
[53:45.32]How many viewers do I have?
[53:47.54]I don't know, I'm just saying.
[53:48.52]What the fuck?
[53:49.56]Why... They're not here.
[53:50.40]Okay.
[53:50.84]What the fuck?
[53:52.40]I'm like...
[53:55.86]I don't want to be annoyed by that, but, I mean, like... Fuck.
[54:03.90]Do not let Farmer Maggot's dog spot you.
[54:06.17]Use rocks to distract the dog.
[54:08.23]I'm not gonna throw rocks at a dog.
[54:09.71]Where's this dog?
[54:17.66]Grip!
[54:18.34]Fang!
[54:19.20]Woof!
[54:20.02]What's all this racket?
[54:22.10]Are there police in this world?
[54:24.36]Who are the police?
[54:25.44]Is the lads supposed to be the police?
[54:47.77]Okay, well... I'm stealing your mushrooms.
[54:51.55]Don't let the dog see you.
[54:53.33]Okay, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna make sure the dog... There's a sneak.
[55:01.01]Use rocks.
[55:01.47]I don't fucking have rocks!
[55:05.12]Why does this game think I have rocks?
[55:08.96]I don't have rocks!
[55:13.62]Put the ring on.
[55:14.40]Does he turn around?
[55:30.52]I have rocks.
[55:31.22]I don't have rocks?!
[55:48.59]Oh my god.
[55:53.01]There are no rocks.
[55:57.28]I don't have rocks.
[55:58.40]They don't exist.
[55:59.34]I don't have fucking rocks.
[56:05.92]L2.
[56:06.06]You have X, circle, Y. X, circle, Y, it's circle.
[56:27.28]What am I supposed to do with these?
[56:41.02]Is the dog distracted?
[56:42.01]Stop!
[56:49.61]Oh my god!
[57:21.08]Turn around!
[57:21.66]What?
[57:21.90]He turned around for one second.
[57:27.35]Alright, hold on.
[57:37.75]I'll get it.
[57:55.35]Oh fuck, where's it going?
[58:01.03]What the fuck was that?
[58:02.01]Get it!
[58:03.87]Healing herb.
[58:04.39]Alright, I did it.
[58:05.89]Go in the doghouse?
[58:06.61]I got it.
[58:13.07]That's all I needed.
[58:13.95]What broke this fence?
[58:37.30]The fence is still fine.
[58:41.54]How do I get in here?
[58:43.15]There's a healing herb.
[58:45.15]For Grandpa.
[58:51.21]Crawl.
[58:53.77]How do you crawl?
[58:54.53]I don't think you can... What the...
[59:08.12]You don't have to be zoomed in for this.
[59:14.62]There is no crawl.
[59:19.36]Maybe the other side?
[59:20.04]Somebody said, why does this look so blurry?
[59:26.00]Well, because this game is from 20 plus years ago.
[59:31.81]And it was... it was not developed with any intention to ever have... Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[59:41.02]Got it.
[59:41.88]That's four.
[59:54.41]Training dummy.
[60:02.13]I got... I completed the sequence, yeah?
[60:04.99]That's one completed.
[60:05.93]Is this the end of the road, though?
[60:10.49]Alright, I got the healing herbs.
[60:13.20]No, there's still more.
[60:14.00]Wait, what's in here?
[60:16.12]Is that just mushrooms?
[60:16.84]Yeah, who cares.
[60:17.66]Can I knock?
[60:25.66]That field of view, though... It's pretty terrible.
[60:34.19]I still have things to attend to before I set out for the old forest.
[60:46.21]Alright boys and girls, strap in, let's go.
[60:58.53]I have my rocks.
[61:00.31]I gotta find the guy's pin.
[61:11.03]Let's go.
[61:15.44]Alright.
[61:16.68]Where's the pin?
[61:17.36]He's mentioned a pin.
[61:19.14]At the old water farm.
[61:20.52]At the old water dam.
[61:21.76]At the old water farm.
[61:22.70]Where is it?
[61:29.37]At the mill.
[61:30.75]Okay.
[61:31.65]I got the healing herbs.
[61:36.51]It's two loading screens back.
[61:38.09]Yeah, but is there anything else out here that I need to do?
[61:47.57]Just check.
[61:48.09]I don't want to have to come back here again for any reason.
[61:52.66]Are you enjoying the game?
[61:54.60]Absolutely not.
[61:56.34]Absolutely not.
[61:57.04]Zero.
[61:57.14]100% zero.
[61:57.78]Um...
[62:07.65]I played my share of pranks when I was Sancho's age.
[62:10.67]But I never took an old man's medicine.
[62:14.79]He can't even beat the first level.
[62:15.89]No, but I... It might get better.
[62:19.37]Cast a lethal arsenal of magic as Gandalf.
[62:22.49]Fight through hordes of enemies as Aragorn.
[62:25.47]Use stealth, cunning, and the One Ring as Frodo.
[62:29.54]Love to see that game.
[62:32.58]I'd love to see that one.
[62:39.04]Where's the old man?
[62:41.84]He actually believes the back of the box.
[62:43.21]This is back when the back of the box was reliable.
[62:47.79]The back of the box in 2001 was more reliable than reviewers today.
[62:52.77]Hello, young Baggins.
[63:00.22]I have found these herbs for you.
[63:01.90]Thank you, young Frodo Baggins, for bringing me these herbs.
[63:05.50]Please, take this as a token of my gratitude.
[63:10.65]You are such a basic fuck.
[63:14.37]Oh yeah?
[63:16.49]Basic, huh?
[63:29.36]Let me show you what you're missing.
[63:47.09]Alright.
[63:48.35]Uh, rock.
[63:50.57]Water.
[63:51.16]Water turn thing.
[63:52.44]What's the thing called?
[63:54.46]What's the water turn thing called?
[63:56.28]He called it something.
[63:57.82]I just don't know.
[63:58.94]I don't know what it was called.
[64:03.16]A mill.
[64:03.42]Oh.
[64:03.94]Is that what it's actually called though?
[64:07.32]What's the divide?
[64:08.04]What's the thing actually called?
[64:09.02]The wheel.
[64:10.14]The water wheel that spins with the platforms on it.
[64:12.44]Is that actually called a water mill?
[64:22.31]Okay, rocks.
[64:23.01]There's nothing back here.
[64:26.45]You're pretending.
[64:27.45]No, I actually don't know.
[64:28.27]I really didn't know.
[64:29.60]I said watermill.
[64:30.42]I didn't know if it was accurate.
[64:31.34]I don't know if it had like a specific term.
[64:35.38]A liquid wheel.
[64:42.40]No, milling is grinding.
[64:43.59]You don't grind water.
[64:45.93]Is that true?
[64:47.09]You use the wheel to turn a shaft that grinds grain.
[64:49.97]Oh, yeah.
[64:50.51]You're right.
[64:51.05]No, you're right.
[64:55.16]That wasn't me that said that.
[64:56.86]I was reading something in chat.
[64:59.66]I know what a waterwheel is.
[65:06.25]I'm pretending for views.
[65:11.05]Don't.
[65:12.07]Oh, I'm a fucking idiot.
[65:13.33]Whoa, what is this?
[65:14.32]Waterwheel?
[65:15.56]Dope.
[65:16.24]Oh, I'm just a fucking dope that don't know.
[65:23.40]View vacuum.
[65:35.95]Worst new character?
[65:42.58]New character?
[65:43.40]How is that a new character?
[65:44.62]What?
[65:44.98]How many times do I have to hit this?
[65:51.50]Alright, Barbara Howell, what's up?
[66:02.95]It's a water-powered mill.
[66:06.76]I know, guys.
[66:07.58]I know.
[66:12.77]What?
[66:12.89]Oh, this is a two-parter?
[66:13.77]Oh my god, we did it.
[66:14.57]We did it.
[66:15.19]I got the pin.
[66:16.01]So... Oh, okay, let's go.
[66:36.58]Where was this guy?
[66:37.16]Anybody remember?
[66:41.12]Wait.
[66:42.05]Now that I can throw rocks... That's not like a secret or something.
[66:50.93]Why do the hobbits paint Illuminati symbols on their houses?
[66:57.00]Does that have any story reference or anything?
[66:58.94]Alright, where was that original guy?
[67:17.44]Use your brain.
[67:18.34]Jerma, click the link, quick!
[67:46.69]That's disgusting.
[67:49.30]I'm gonna be completely real.
[67:50.38]That is gross.
[67:52.88]That's gross.
[67:58.82]Okay, I don't remember where this original dude was.
[68:03.90]He was... I don't remember.
[68:11.57]It was right around here somewhere.
[68:14.66]Next to the bridge?
[68:19.65]Where's this guy?
[68:21.01]It's not this guy, right?
[68:22.61]No.
[68:23.01]It's the guy by the bridge.
[68:40.54]Was it?
[68:46.98]If anyone's in this chat that hasn't seen Lord of the Rings, and you're sitting here thinking, hey, Lord of the Rings, that's a cool, I've heard that's pretty good.
[68:55.67]Don't base that off, don't base anything off of what you're watching right now.
[68:58.79]The movie is a, just read, read the, just read the book.
[69:01.55]Someone in this stream right now is going, I'm never gonna fucking watch this movie, what a shitty movie.
[69:16.85]No, the movies.
[69:17.43]Just watch it.
[69:17.91]Alright, that's it.
[69:20.47]I don't have any more quests.
[69:23.37]It was nothing else, right?
[69:28.11]It's time to leave.
[69:35.48]You forgot about the main quest.
[69:38.84]What do you mean, main quest?
[69:48.25]Find Mary and Pippin.
[69:54.11]The ring is still in your house.
[69:56.99]No.
[69:58.75]Do I have to take it?
[69:59.79]Go to the Green Dragon Inn.
[70:14.92]You're a fake fan.
[70:18.53]I haven't seen Lord of the Rings since I was like 17.
[70:26.92]I don't remember every scene.
[70:28.78]I know he takes, yes, I know he takes the ring, but this is not even the... Okay, you can't, give me a little bit of slack.
[70:35.13]Frodo Baggins doesn't go throw rocks at a guy's weather vane.
[70:40.79]So this is added bonus material.
[70:43.89]In fact, I'm sure a lot of you would probably like that.
[70:47.28]If there was a bonus super extended edition, the Lord of the Rings fans would go fucking nuts.
[70:52.08]If there was a two hour long segment of Frodo just throwing rocks and stuff and picking up mushrooms.
[71:08.02]The new bonus extended, extended edition.
[71:10.27]It's six and a half hours long.
[71:12.77]Then it just... You put the disk in and it starts with this string.
[71:18.35]Where's this inn?
[71:19.59]No, not the inn.
[71:20.37]I gotta go to my... I have to go to my house.
[71:28.67]There it is.
[71:29.01]There's the green door.
[71:30.59]There's the green dragon door.
[71:35.64]That sounds like Pog to me.
[71:41.24]Alright, give me my ring.
[71:51.19]You've walked the area in circles for 40 minutes and you don't know the layout.
[71:54.73]Uh-oh, we talked about this in pre-stream chat.
[71:58.87]I'm going to bring it up one more time here.
[72:01.11]Because it's worth noting.
[72:03.49]If a game has... No, people are going to think I'm an idiot.
[72:08.55]I'm not going to say it.
[72:09.45]If you're in pre-stream, you know.
[72:14.23]Any pre-streamers here?
[72:16.07]Any pre-stream chatters here?
[72:25.41]If your game has move around, dodge, attack, jump... I'm gonna destroy it.
[72:34.45]If your game has no minimap, I will not be able to play.
[72:38.04]Unless it has- follows that category.
[72:40.38]It has to have four buttons or less.
[72:42.84]And it has to be constrained to one small area at a time.
[72:54.15]But!
[72:55.09]You give me that scenario.
[72:56.47]You give me four buttons or less.
[72:59.55]Put me in an area where I just have to fucking do it.
[73:03.20]I'll do it.
[73:04.68]I'll do it better than anybody.
[73:14.29]Where's the... It's in one of these... You're a literal drone.
[73:27.33]I... I am... Just give this thing one specific task to do in one small area, and it'll be really good at it.
[73:37.90]I'm just a fucking sentry gun.
[73:49.67]Where's the ring?
[73:53.64]I even make noises like a sentry gun, too.
[74:01.04]Okay, I- and so I like look over at chat, look back, look over at chat, like I've- Alright, where's the ring?
[74:06.65]It's in here?
[74:07.45]It's- isn't it right here?
[74:10.38]Isn't it in here?
[74:21.06]No, I don't.
[74:22.44]It said I have to pick this up and take this.
[74:25.52]That is the chest with the ring in it.
[74:26.98]So... You don't need the ring.
[74:34.37]Alright.
[74:41.35]You put me in a room with four buttons.
[74:43.19]Mm-hmm.
[74:47.25]You put me in a room with four buttons in a small room, and I will fucking annihilate.
[74:52.19]I will destroy.
[74:54.65]Y'all have seen it.
[74:55.39]I don't even, I don't have to even tell you this.
[75:00.28]I will prove, I had to prove this by people saying, what are you talking about?
[75:02.60]That doesn't make any sense.
[75:04.00]Those of you that watched the, like, two, or what, it was one terrible World of Warcraft streams I ever did.
[75:11.96]This is real.
[75:13.54]I pressed 1 through 5 on my hotbar and clicked everything else.
[75:24.31]I don't... That's not me making it up.
[75:25.61]You can go look at that terrible, awful fucking bot.
[75:30.41]Okay.
[75:32.17]Now, let me focus.
[75:33.23]What was the final task?
[75:35.77]Was to find Merry and Pippin.
[75:41.46]We'll go to the Green Dragon Inn.
[75:44.20]That's the Proudfeet.
[75:48.73]Alright, let's go.
[75:51.41]In the garden.
[75:54.05]Arcane Mage Clicker, Omega Lull.
[76:00.60]I was Arcane Mage before it was cool, by the way.
[76:03.08]Can I be real with you here?
[76:05.40]I was Arcane Mage before it was even any good.
[76:09.18]And then it became the best thing in the whole game, and I quit World of Warcraft.
[76:12.40]That's true.
[76:13.32]That is a real statement.
[76:15.43]Arcane Mage was dogshit.
[76:17.21]They patched it, made it the best thing in the whole game, and I quit World of Warcraft and have never played since.
[76:24.61]I also played Discipline Priest when they didn't have any moves.
[76:27.64]Back in Vanilla.
[76:30.73]Back when Discipline Priests did the- rewind, delete, snip, pull, complete.
[76:37.24]Uh, when Discipline Priests had two spells, and you got kicked out of every party you were in, that was me.
[76:55.89]They had Power Infusion, Omega Lull, yeah.
[77:00.44]That's the worst spell in the whole game.
[77:02.40]Does that spell still exist?
[77:03.92]That's the worst spell in the entire game.
[77:08.34]I just found it.
[77:14.30]Why did you want to do that?
[77:15.26]Because I was different.
[77:18.35]And people would say, oh, they'd say spec in a whisper, and I'd say discipline.
[77:23.64]They'd go LOL, and I would get blocked.
[77:26.24]But I was like, I'm fucking cool though.
[77:28.90]I got power infusion.
[77:30.20]And the one time that we were in PvP, and there was a mage, and this is presence of mind Pyroblast existed, power infusion on that mage, you could one-shot somebody, and I was that guy that let you one-shot the guy from across the fucking game.
[77:50.35]Fire mages were my best friend.
[77:53.99]It's a made-up story.
[77:55.49]If you've played WoW, you know that's fucking real.
[77:57.49]That would take a lot to make up to know all those mechanics.
[78:00.62]Okay.
[78:00.80]Where's Merry and Pippin?
[78:25.85]Here they are.
[78:27.19]Mary and Pippin.
[78:29.35]Hello, Frodo.
[78:30.47]What took you so long?
[78:31.85]Did that sluggard Sam Gamgee forget to tell you that we'd be here?
[78:35.30]Never mind Sam.
[78:36.74]What brings you two scoundrels all the way to Bywater?
[78:39.28]Breakfast.
[78:39.88]No, we're up to lunch now.
[78:42.14]Pull up a chair.
[78:43.12]You came all this way just for breakfast?
[78:44.92]Isn't there a line in the movie?
[78:47.39]Don't tell him I'm too late.
[78:49.63]Our conspiracy is unmasked.
[78:51.27]May as well tell him everything now.
[78:52.83]Since you'll be walking past Old Maggot's farm, we thought we'd have a go at his garden again.
[78:58.47]Three is company, just like old times.
[79:01.58]Remember those mushrooms?
[79:03.06]I remember his ferocious dogs.
[79:04.90]I believe Frodo's afraid.
[79:06.64]Are you afraid, Pippin?
[79:07.84]I'm never afraid, Merry.
[79:09.54]Those dogs are all bark.
[79:11.50]No bite.
[79:12.50]Old Maggot's running to show me their bite.
[79:14.48]Only because he caught you.
[79:16.08]Just be careful this time.
[79:17.82]Remember the smell of those mushrooms cooking?
[79:20.24]I do love mushrooms.
[79:21.89]Ah, go to the farm.
[79:25.03]Okay.
[79:25.55]You're gonna meet me at the farm, huh?
[79:30.83]Fuck out of here.
[79:45.75]Dammit, I'm too tall.
[79:57.80]Alright, I need two points.
[79:58.78]It's gonna bounce off his head and hit him in the head.
[80:04.12]Damn it.
[80:05.90]Alright, fuck it.
[80:06.32]I'm outta here.
[80:06.64]They said more community subs come in from Rhineville on top of the fucking... 150.
[80:18.89]Thank you, Rhineville.
[80:25.70]Fill the bar with rocks.
[80:28.23]That'll take too long.
[80:30.13]And this game is already dragging out, so... That's gonna take way too long.
[80:40.24]Dude, here comes the hype train.
[80:41.34]No, I made the cooldown of the hype train... ...long.
[80:45.96]So it can't happen more than once every, like, four or five hours.
[80:48.68]I'm actually gonna probably make it eight hours.
[80:54.09]So it can only happen, like, once a stream.
[81:04.09]Make it once a week.
[81:05.37]I can't even do that.
[81:14.38]Pipetrain scam.
[81:16.00]Fraud.
[81:29.63]I got in the shower just there.
[81:30.95]I missed it.
[81:31.39]I have no idea what you said.
[81:34.00]It's something about taking a shower.
[81:35.02]I don't even know what it was.
[81:35.70]It was something about taking a shower.
[81:36.76]Whatever it was.
[81:39.34]Can we please move on?
[81:42.79]I'm trying.
[81:44.61]I'm making every effort.
[81:52.83]I'm trying to get there.
[81:55.76]Still in level 1?
[82:06.50]Cell Bag End to Lobelia Sackville.
[82:13.94]How the fuck do I do that?
[82:14.88]What do you mean scroll down there's more?
[82:27.51]No, there's not.
[82:28.49]It's Cell Bag End.
[82:41.62]Okay, I have to sell Bag M. Where does that person live?
[82:50.22]Just throw rocks at Minto.
[82:54.04]Use the map.
[82:54.66]This is a good map.
[82:59.70]Yeah, use map.
[83:01.76]The land of hobbits west of Brandywine River.
[83:05.54]Oh, this helps me.
[83:09.94]A great satellite image.
[83:12.66]Zoomed way the fuck out.
[83:15.32]This is gonna help.
[83:22.44]What's with the title of the stream?
[83:24.62]Um... Just link the clip.
[83:27.01]Link the clip.
[83:27.85]Every time somebody asks about the title, just link the clip.
[83:32.45]Aren't we at the farm?
[83:33.25]Where are they?
[83:39.86]Didn't they say, oh, we'll meet you at the farm?
[83:43.90]Well, where are they?
[83:44.52]Didn't they say they're gonna meet me here?
[84:05.33]You have to... I have to sell Bag End first.
[84:17.68]Alright, so because nobody's actually linking you the real clip, I'll just tell you.
[84:20.88]In the amount of time that it could have taken somebody just to control C, control V, the right one, I could have just told you.
[84:30.53]Somebody guaranteed that I would not get past this first part.
[84:35.07]And I'm proving them wrong.
[84:37.71]That was so easy, that was less than a sentence.
[84:39.87]Why is that so hard for me to do?
[84:48.27]Where's this person?
[84:52.41]Another huge, huge bit donation just came in from Ryanville on top of the community subs.
[84:57.43]Ryanville!
[84:59.75]5,000 bits from Ryanville.
[85:01.29]Huge.
[85:05.82]And they say, what if the hype train is in bits?
[85:10.05]I think it combines them.
[85:11.75]Anyhow, I just moved.
[85:12.63]Had your VODs on while I put together new furniture and such.
[85:15.41]Sitting here doing art.
[85:16.85]You ever want the greedy Grinner to appear in a Magic the Gathering card?
[85:20.16]Let me know.
[85:21.06]Yes.
[85:22.20]Do it.
[85:23.56]Are you serious?
[85:24.22]Oh, wait.
[85:26.44]This is the magic.
[85:27.48]Alright.
[85:27.70]Yeah.
[85:28.20]Yeah.
[85:28.42]Let's go.
[85:33.42]Let's go.
[85:37.95]Put, put, get, alright, I don't know what, I don't know what it's gonna take.
[85:41.55]Get the greedy Grinner.
[85:43.61]Into Magic the Gathering.
[85:51.55]Well, then I would have to play Magic the Gathering and show what you've made.
[85:55.03]And that, I mean, that's worth it.
[86:08.16]Best timeline for Greedy Grinner.
[86:10.06]Alright, where is this person?
[86:11.32]I have to find them in the town.
[86:12.80]That's Rhineville.
[86:17.22]Again, thanks for the 5,000 fucking bits, dude.
[86:24.18]Ultra rare.
[86:25.90]Foil.
[86:32.15]Next to the bell.
[86:33.09]Thank you.
[86:34.07]And that's one of the reasons why I love this community!
[86:39.55]Helping me out!
[86:41.61]Nobody at this bell, you fucking liar.
[86:43.46]What's with this community?
[86:45.96]This community seriously, like, fucking always fucking me up and shit?
[86:51.32]Getting kind of sick of it.
[86:54.31]Oh, there you are.
[86:58.19]Hello, Nobelia.
[86:59.35]Where's the Sheriff?
[87:00.73]Where's that lazy Robin Smallborough?
[87:02.81]I couldn't say.
[87:04.27]Now, about Bag End...
[87:07.38]Sorry.
[87:08.56]Now, Brianville, if you're serious, hit me up in a... I'm going to follow you on Twitter.
[87:19.33]Hit me up in a DM on Twitter.
[87:20.87]Hit me up on Twitter, and then I'm going to follow you.
[87:23.89]And then we'll talk in DMs.
[87:25.47]Because that's funny to me.
[87:27.83]If it's possible, we should work on that.
[87:31.18]We should work on that.
[87:42.99]Am I not tall enough to do this anymore?
[87:44.09]I can't just hit my fucking head on this?
[87:55.16]Didn't I already hit this?
[88:04.64]Now we can leave.
[88:05.88]Now we can leave.
[88:06.74]Now what's going on?
[88:08.16]I don't hold with reckless bell ringing.
[88:10.27]I rang the bell.
[88:11.41]Lobelia wants you to know there are wolves in the Shire.
[88:14.31]Oh, is that all?
[88:15.55]I've heard that rumor, but I reckon no one's seen these wolves.
[88:19.33]Not even Lobelia.
[88:20.63]Oh, if any wolves approach the Shire, the Bounders will chase them off, just as they chase away foxes and such.
[88:26.72]I'm glad the Shire is well protected.
[88:28.68]Now if that's all, I've got a mother to return to in the Green Dragon.
[88:35.48]you know how many club remixes of the shire song exist that might be one of the most sampled songs ever in house music alright show quests sell bag end I can't wait what didn't I just do this
[89:09.43]Wait, where is she?
[89:10.41]I have to talk to her again?
[89:11.51]Wouldn't she just be right here?
[89:13.29]Where is she?
[89:16.33]She's behind me?
[89:18.01]What do you mean?
[89:20.97]You just ding-dong ditched her.
[89:35.63]There she is.
[89:36.49]God damn it, man.
[89:37.83]Give me a room with four buttons and I'll fucking destroy it.
[89:41.01]Hey, how many of you were here?
[89:42.17]How many of you... Alright.
[89:43.59]How many of you are here for Undertale and Deltarune shit?
[89:46.92]That's a box this big on the screen with two buttons.
[89:49.84]Remember Jevil?
[89:50.54]Yep.
[89:52.35]Someone finally came to his senses and rang that bell.
[89:56.03]Now we'll have safety and order in the Shire.
[89:58.70]I do hope so.
[89:59.84]Now then, what did you want to speak to me about?
[90:02.54]Make it snappy, I've a lot of things to tend to.
[90:04.93]It's about Bag End.
[90:06.31]You said you wanted to buy it.
[90:07.53]What?
[90:09.09]Still bragging about it, yeah.
[90:10.33]I'm the only person that's done that on Twitch.
[90:12.37]What, I can't show my gold medal sometimes?
[90:29.36]What?
[90:30.08]Gamgee!
[90:31.02]That dirty potato grubber and his son might plunder all of Bag End in the dead of night!
[90:36.15]Good day, Lobelia.
[90:37.63]Yes, yes!
[90:39.25]A very good day indeed!
[90:41.29]My sweet little Lotho will be so happy!
[90:44.37]Bag End at last!
[90:46.85]Why you consort with that kind, I'll never know, Frodo.
[90:50.77]Having farmers and dwarves and wizards for company, and never inviting your own flesh and blood to tea!
[90:58.43]Honestly!
[91:00.11]Yeah, whatever, lady.
[91:03.12]You look like you're part of a fucking iPad Match 3 gardening game.
[91:06.04]Get the fuck out of here.
[91:16.69]We're done.
[91:17.49]Get the one-
[91:30.11]I remember the first fish I caught here with Bilbo.
[91:32.36]We gotta get the ring.
[91:33.50]We're almost done.
[91:36.65]Let's give it a leave.
[91:38.46]Dude, you've walked up and down this road like ten times.
[91:40.56]I-I-I don't- I don't- I just don't understand how you can continue to not know where you are.
[91:46.09]I-I know, I know.
[91:47.01]I-I just- I don't pay- I pay attention to the- to the wrong things.
[91:50.17]ADHD, and that's what happens.
[91:52.13]No, I know, I understand that you have like- like attention, like, deficit issues, but dude, like, you've done it ten fucking times.
[91:57.69]Just pay attention once.
[91:59.63]I know, I know, but I- like, I'm looking at- I'm talking to chat and shit.
[92:03.55]And I'm like talking, and I'm- I'm walking around.
[92:26.45]He's not going to be able to pass the first mission laughing my ass off.
[92:30.28]We're about to beat the first mission.
[92:32.22]And what was it?
[92:32.70]I was going to get 200 bits if I did it.
[92:38.46]That's what they said.
[92:38.98]They said, Jerma, I guarantee you won't get past the first level.
[92:45.66]I will give you 200 bits.
[92:47.39]Not even enough to trigger the end of the stream message reading.
[92:53.51]And I was like, fuck, dude.
[92:54.57]I'm going.
[92:55.05]Let's go.
[93:11.45]There was a bee next to you.
[93:13.05]A hornet.
[93:13.95]Don't hurt bees.
[93:32.65]Alright, it only took an hour and a half.
[93:35.89]God, it took that long.
[93:37.87]No, it didn't.
[93:38.45]It didn't take that long.
[93:39.41]I think it's time for me and the ring to leave Hobbiton and begin this journey.
[93:45.45]Here we go.
[93:48.95]The one ring.
[93:51.53]Take the bag end key to Gaffer.
[93:56.39]Take the bag end key to Gaffer Gamgee at number three Bagshot Row and take the one ring to Rivendell.
[94:13.29]Put it on.
[94:14.21]Ooh!
[94:16.85]We're getting it previously on the next episode.
[94:19.62]Here we go.
[94:19.88]What happened?
[94:38.49]Shire.
[94:40.91]Save game, save game, save game, save game, save game.
[94:45.83]Save game?
[94:46.43]Save game.
[94:52.56]Oh.
[94:53.62]Holy shit, I... Okay.
[94:56.96]Oh, that guarantee just got fucking stuffed into the ground.
[95:01.46]That... If I lost... I'll go back to the beginning.
[95:05.69]The very beginning.
[95:06.79]Oh, man.
[95:07.43]Oh, man.
[95:08.95]I didn't know that was... Okay.
[95:10.43]Alright.
[95:11.43]That person right now is just sitting there going...
[95:13.56]Fuck!
[95:14.60]No!
[95:15.30]Why did he see it?
[95:16.98]Oh, so... Oh!
[95:20.63]A rider.
[95:25.05]All in black.
[95:25.95]No.
[95:26.59]Mr. Baggins has gone away.
[95:28.33]Left this morning.
[95:29.70]Why did Baggins go?
[95:34.76]Why is none of my business?
[95:36.72]All yours.
[95:37.10]I'm not a rider.
[95:38.04]Why?
[95:38.22]Where did Baggins go?
[95:43.47]That's no secret.
[95:44.57]He's walking to Bucklebury or some such place.
[95:47.15]Is this place far from here?
[95:52.91]They don't know?
[95:53.47]This is, like, weird.
[95:54.85]Yes, quite a ways down the East Road.
[95:57.17]Never been so far myself.
[95:57.97]Why is he acting?
[95:59.13]This is... We're watching, like, a... This is like a Fallout game.
[96:05.69]He's the main character.
[96:06.67]This is, like, dialog options.
[96:07.83]No, I can't give no message.
[96:09.33]Now, good night to you.
[96:21.34]Good evening, Master Gamgee.
[96:22.72]Good evening to you, Frodo.
[96:24.27]A peculiar rider came asking after you.
[96:26.81]I don't wish to make his acquaintance.
[96:28.63]Nor me, since shivers at my back just to hear his hollow voice.
[96:33.15]Where's Sam?
[96:34.11]He was waiting for you, but that dreaded Pippin Toop came to collect him.
[96:39.74]He was making it up in his head the whole time.
[97:04.67]Alright, let's go.
[97:05.77]Avoid being detected by the dark riders.
[97:08.03]Use sneaking to avoid detection.
[97:09.51]Press lightly on the left analog stick to sneak.
[97:13.55]Wait, this is not sneak?
[97:17.00]Okay.
[97:38.34]I... God.
[97:39.48]I guarantee.
[97:43.02]Holy shit.
[97:44.54]I can't fucking believe it.
[97:46.30]I can't believe it.
[97:47.38]I can't believe I actually fucking saved the game.
[97:49.32]Oh my god.
[97:52.95]That's... I can't... You... Seriously.
[97:56.43]Thank you to the savers in this chat.
[97:59.83]Holy shit.
[98:05.13]Who fucking told him?
[98:06.47]Who told him?
[98:09.87]Wow.
[98:12.99]Oh my god.
[98:15.49]Oh my god, that would have been so terrible.
[98:17.65]I'm telling you, that person owes me 200 bits.
[98:41.24]That's unbelievable.
[98:44.28]Okay, where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[98:47.30]Just throw rocks.
[98:49.04]No, not back at me.
[98:50.10]Oh, great.
[98:52.50]Where's he?
[98:59.21]What's that?
[99:00.23]What's that?
[99:01.45]Is that a rock?
[99:02.51]I said another rock.
[99:03.85]Where are these rocks coming from?
[99:06.89]Memo Baggins!
[99:09.83]Who's doing that?
[99:41.53]Wait, there's another one over here.
[99:43.03]What the fuck?
[99:51.82]Oh, ah!
[99:53.80]Shh.
[100:04.72]Oh my god.
[100:08.33]Okay, where...
[100:17.19]Did a fly fly into your mouth?
[100:23.77]That's it.
[100:38.62]Somebody, please, take that clip before the stream ends.
[100:42.42]Somebody do it.
[100:42.98]I don't know.
[100:44.96]Denominate who does it.
[100:46.46]Make a buzz, fly buzzing sound, and then like a fly flying into my mouth sound.
[100:50.59]I have to hear it.
[100:52.15]Oh, this sucks.
[101:03.96]I don't even... Here's the thing.
[101:06.39]I'm such a stupid idiot.
[101:07.55]I don't even know which way is the right way to go to the farm.
[101:10.99]It's this way, right?
[101:13.87]The way I'm facing?
[101:14.59]Guys, the map is meaningless.
[101:33.73]Oh, goddammit.
[101:36.43]Where is he?
[101:36.85]Ain't nobody here.
[101:44.11]Fuck, I don't even know where he is.
[101:57.82]I see such erratic movements, too.
[102:00.52]This is not even the right fucking way.
[102:26.32]Use the ring you penis I don't what do you mean use the ring?
[102:30.09]How do I use the ring?
[102:37.81]Is it not on?
[102:38.47]Is it on?
[102:51.47]There's a button for it.
[102:56.39]Well, I've pressed every button.
[103:00.55]Select.
[103:00.91]It's not select.
[103:01.45]Start.
[103:01.77]It's not start.
[103:02.35]Alright, which way do I go?
[103:03.13]I have to throw a rock over here.
[103:24.08]Write a fucking sign.
[103:28.76]L1 and R1 at the same time.
[103:30.02]That's not it.
[103:34.88]Is he going?
[103:37.70]Look.
[103:38.06]Look over there.
[103:40.14]Crazy, I know.
[103:43.36]Go get it!
[103:47.12]Go get it!
[103:49.50]Look!
[104:02.38]Was I just here?
[104:03.28]Was I just here?
[104:06.86]It's this way.
[104:07.28]It's this way.
[104:07.64]It's not... It's this way.
[104:13.59]Alright, where is he?
[104:16.45]Right there.
[104:16.77]He's coming up the road.
[104:18.39]Oh, fuck.
[104:29.53]He knows I'm over here.
[104:30.54]This is stupid.
[104:32.18]He's not going to leap.
[104:41.94]Where is he?
[104:42.70]Okay, I'll just...
[104:52.18]This thing sucks.
[104:54.06]This sucks.
[104:55.92]I can't even throw a rock.
[105:07.33]I thought he already ran by.
[105:08.39]No, no, no, no.
[105:16.37]I heard like the... I thought he ran by already.
[105:21.18]He's not gonna beat it ever.
[105:23.24]Yes he is.
[105:23.58]Where the hell am I?
[105:29.74]Jesus Christ.
[105:35.03]Okay.
[105:35.67]This is ridiculous.
[105:55.10]Just going.
[106:02.07]Will this hide me?
[106:02.89]Being over here?
[106:21.65]I'm not throwing any more rocks.
[106:24.21]He's trying to come over here and he can't because his Pathic doesn't go this way.
[106:27.52]But... I tried.
[106:59.14]God damn it.
[106:59.76]What is it hitting?
[107:19.74]Just quit.
[107:20.18]I'm not quitting.
[107:25.62]No.
[107:27.46]Can I save it?
[107:28.14]Hold on.
[107:28.98]I can save it.
[107:30.06]Wait, watch this.
[107:36.36]Does it just save your state?
[107:37.92]It does, doesn't it?
[107:38.52]Okay, avoid detection.
[107:58.15]I'm gonna save it right when I get to a safe place.
[107:59.70]Dude, the controls are so bad.
[108:12.58]So bad for a sneaking game.
[108:17.78]Don't throw any rocks.
[108:18.70]He's gonna come over here.
[108:19.50]Wait.
[108:40.46]Fucking had it.
[108:41.14]I was right there.
[108:42.06]I gotta go to the tree on the left.
[108:43.52]Nah, I gotta go to that tree.
[108:46.02]I gotta get to that tree.
[108:56.44]What if I just do it immediately, right?
[108:59.56]I wonder.
[109:01.70]Okay.
[109:02.56]That's the strat right there.
[109:06.48]He's too stupid to run this way.
[109:08.97]They don't have pathing over here.
[109:10.33]Just don't go near a road.
[109:11.89]Save it here.
[109:13.93]No, don't.
[109:14.51]What if he sees me from there?
[109:16.61]Oh my god.
[109:28.20]Alright, does this game have higher than a 2?
[109:31.42]On like Metacritic.
[109:35.83]What?
[109:38.17]Go right and immediate left Hold on Just follow the path out of town but don't walk on it
[110:07.88]It's supposed to sneak, but there's nowhere to fucking hide.
[110:12.16]Oh.
[110:14.44]And I just... It's over.
[110:15.26]I'm just restarted.
[110:20.60]Will the sign protect me?
[110:44.73]You say just sneak?
[110:47.06]The amount of pressure it takes to sneak is the hardest thing in the whole game.
[110:53.70]It's like surgery to sneak.
[110:56.22]It's literal surgery.
[110:59.60]You have to tilt the analog forward a tenth of a centimeter.
[111:04.41]If you go further than that, you're gonna run.
[111:26.42]Don't delete!
[111:29.36]I guarantee.
[111:30.56]I guarantee.
[111:35.96]He started g- I know.
[111:39.69]Can you imagine if I hadn't saved it?
[111:42.13]Imagine getting back here without saving the game and having to do it over again.
[111:47.43]So, it's right and then immediate left.
[111:49.53]Is that correct?
[112:00.50]Wait, fly video's done?
[112:02.29]Is it really?
[112:04.27]Yes, give it to me.
[112:10.55]This is important.
[112:13.86]I gotta put this on screen.
[112:19.48]Fly flies into Jerva's mouth.
[112:30.53]Okay, let's see.
[112:31.85]You can hear it, right?
[112:34.21]Uh, let's get it on screen.
[112:36.55]That'd be good, wouldn't it?
[112:37.91]Oh, oh yeah!
[112:58.93]Jerva hits a grand slam!
[113:01.21]Okay, hold on.
[113:17.47]Let me go back.
[113:19.99]I want to see- No, I want to see the video again.
[113:21.85]I want to see the- Why can I hear myself talking?
[113:25.79]What the fuck is going on?
[113:27.14]Stop, stop, stop.
[113:28.14]I want to see the video again.
[113:30.56]Why can I hear myself talking?
[113:31.72]This is fucked up.
[113:32.66]What the fuck happened?
[113:43.86]Dude, autoplay on YouTube sucks.
[113:46.86]What a stupid fucking feature.
[113:48.79]What a dumbass feature.
[113:55.96]By the time that you get what you want... Oh, that was a good, like, 10-second video.
[114:01.92]How about this one?
[114:02.54]How about that?
[114:03.02]No, no, go back.
[114:03.56]How about that one?
[114:04.40]I'll go back.
[114:06.55]And every time I disable it, it's enabled again.
[114:20.20]I literally...
[114:24.31]That's a fucking thing.
[114:26.29]Just give me a clip of me watching that.
[114:28.75]I want to see it.
[114:30.66]No one knows how to turn it off.
[114:33.08]It's because YouTube is fucking desperate to keep people engaged.
[114:38.12]So these motherfuckers just make you autoplay every single place you go.
[114:41.73]So it inflates the amount of views on the whole website.
[114:54.18]What if you're not logged in, though?
[114:55.90]What if you're on a different device?
[114:58.02]I've been logged in and autoplay's turned on.
[115:00.98]Give me the clip of me watching it.
[115:02.98]I can't... My setup, I got a shitty audio setup.
[115:10.97]Here's the video.
[115:21.25]Alright, I'll just watch the video.
[115:25.40]No, not the ALCS Grand Slam video.
[115:29.71]Oh my god.
[115:30.55]I even have- I haven't copied to my fucking clipboard.
[115:33.13]I'm just gonna watch it.
[115:34.09]I'll be right back.
[115:34.57]Alright, that's pretty funny.
[115:43.06]Good work.
[115:53.42]A thank you, AwakenedFear, for the five community subs.
[115:57.72]Thank you.
[115:58.04]Appreciate it.
[116:00.60]He's stalling.
[116:01.54]Yeah, I am, because fuck this game.
[116:04.56]I can't... I'm gonna get proved.
[116:07.72]There's one person in this chat that's gonna be proven right.
[116:11.43]And this infuriates me at the moment.
[116:22.27]Why won't he walk by?
[116:32.75]Where is he?
[116:33.51]Does he usually come out by now?
[116:37.45]Where the fuck is the... What?
[116:39.31]Where... Did you spawn?
[116:40.97]Did he spawn in?
[116:48.69]I think the play is... Um... Run... I'm gonna try this.
[116:55.15]Run immediately to the right, behind this tree.
[116:56.83]Run.
[116:57.93]Stop right here.
[116:59.61]The rock is blocking me.
[117:00.87]Of course it is.
[117:14.50]I beat this when I was 8.
[117:15.48]I guarantee you didn't.
[117:18.08]I guarantee you did not beat this when you were 8 years old.
[117:20.26]You stopped here.
[117:21.46]And cried.
[117:22.26]And then your mother returned the game.
[117:30.43]You guarantee that, guy?
[117:31.75]Yeah.
[117:32.41]Oh, I guarantee it.
[117:43.73]It comes up this road.
[117:44.94]I'm gonna use this rock.
[118:05.56]Stop running.
[118:06.26]I don't think you understand.
[118:12.00]The amount of movement it takes to go from sneaking to running is less than a hair on your damn head.
[118:33.94]Jesus Christ, what a stupid mechanic.
[118:37.68]What a dumbass mechanic.
[118:39.95]Why have a FPS throw mechanic if there's an invisible wall in front of me every time?
[118:52.66]He's gonna need a YouTube video to beat this one, too.
[119:09.92]If you made this game and you played through this part again, did you give this to somebody to play?
[119:15.78]And say, hey, what do you think about this level?
[119:18.62]Is this just a scenario where you're not going to tell your friend that this whole thing sucks?
[119:25.07]Hey, I made this level, Lord of the Rings.
[119:27.75]It's a literally celebrated human franchise.
[119:31.47]Peter Jackson just made a movie.
[119:32.55]It was like $200 million.
[119:33.61]What do you think about this level?
[119:36.56]Oh, it's great.
[119:39.01]it's really good you should print it it's a book series this game came out like less than 6 months after the fucking 200 million dollar movie
[120:06.09]I got an idea.
[120:06.81]I'm gonna get up and throw fucking rocks at him.
[120:15.90]One of the most celebrated human franchises ever.
[120:21.38]Man, you got a sneaking throw rock mechanic.
[120:29.46]Is it working?
[120:48.46]No, that way.
[120:49.20]That way.
[121:03.53]Save it here.

[121:34.59]Which way do I go?
[121:35.13]This way?
[121:44.53]Which way do I go?
[121:46.91]This way, right?
[121:52.64]7pm Boston time.
[121:53.48]Don't forget where you came from.
[121:54.90]Am I going the right way?
[122:12.06]What if I stay in the water?
[122:22.77]Oh my god!
[122:46.46]This is not even a what the fuck are you talking about?
[122:49.94]Why is the Hippocasus like 5,000 feet tall?
[122:57.76]They're bouncing off the visible ceiling.
[123:00.47]The most celebrated franchise in human history.
[123:13.53]Save it here.
[123:16.38]I think, right?

[123:39.03]Alright, we're good here.
[123:42.25]Just keep him... Don't throw this.
[123:43.59]It's gonna hit the fucking wall.
[123:45.79]It's not first person mode.
[123:47.49]It's just first person camera.
[123:50.09]You're actually just sitting in the same spot.
[123:52.67]It's not a first person mode.
[123:54.17]It just moves the camera in front of your face.
[123:56.70]Where's the other one?
[123:57.34]There he is.

[128:41.37]He's typing.
[128:53.25]Are you in the zone?
[128:54.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[128:55.61]No, there is no zone.
[128:57.68]The zone is I... One person told me they guaranteed I couldn't get past the first part.
[129:02.08]Once I get past the first part, it literally doesn't matter.
[129:06.30]Frodo, I am in your debt.
[129:08.74]If you hadn't come along, I'd be a midnight morsel for that beast.
[129:12.59]I'm glad you're alright, Robin.
[129:14.19]We've not seen wolves for a hundred years.
[129:16.89]So I hear.
[129:17.83]It's an ill omen.
[129:19.39]What could it mean?
[129:20.11]He's not even here anymore?
[129:20.95]What the fuck?
[129:22.03]What?
[129:22.85]Oh, write you off, Frodo.
[129:24.93]And I should get back on patrol.
[129:26.15]Alright, let's go meet him.
[129:26.90]Yes, but tell the other sheriffs to watch for more dangers in the Shire.
[129:30.12]Yes, of course.
[129:31.90]Everyone just got like an opportunity to be like, wait a minute, we can do it now.
[129:35.42]Do it right now.
[129:40.84]No, not right now.
[129:45.53]Let's set it up, actually.
[129:46.55]Let's set it up for real for tomorrow.
[129:49.55]We'll do it tomorrow.

[130:07.99]Come on, that'll be five days in a row of streams He didn't even say that Yes he did On Discord
[130:34.90]You're a liar.
[130:35.60]Leak the DMs.
[130:36.50]You're a liar.
[130:37.06]Leak the DMs.
[130:43.08]What?
[130:44.77]The one ring.
[130:45.75]What do you mean the one ring?
[130:49.23]What's going on?
[130:53.59]Why am I beating up... Why am I getting surrounded by dogs?
[131:07.87]What's going on?
[131:09.22]We need one ring.
[131:10.48]I don't remember this part of the movie.
[131:14.46]I didn't save it.
[131:15.40]Oh, no.
[131:27.17]It's right here.
[131:27.73]It's right here.
[131:28.21]It's right here.
[131:28.67]It's right here.
[131:29.11]It's right here.
[131:29.61]It's right here.
[131:30.47]It's right here.
[131:44.30]Don't forget to save.
[131:45.06]Dying resets you to the last save.
[131:46.98]Don't worry, I won't.
[131:47.80]I will never forget that ever again.
[131:48.98]I will never forget it again.
[131:50.65]I will never forget it again.
[131:51.89]Go.
[132:00.37]Talk.
[132:03.85]Why did we get so close?
[132:05.77]Alright, I'm gonna get up here and save the game.
[132:13.24]And then hopefully I get to play as Gandalf, because I don't want to play as Frodo anymore.
[132:20.43]Frodo's a swell guy, but I don't want to play as him anymore.
[132:25.67]Joel must have told him he'd never get... Well, that's what he said in the DMs.
[132:30.19]He said, yo, man, I just want to let you know, I don't think you're ever going to get past the first part.
[132:35.19]So do you want to just keep doing this or do you want to play the bomb game?
[132:38.71]He's like, I don't think you're going to be able to do this.
[132:40.70]So that's another person that I have to fucking... Somebody's gave a lot of money.
[132:47.12]Hold on.
[132:48.90]Wait, I didn't save the game.
[132:56.70]Uh, Ishanji gave 10,000 bits.
[133:00.42]Thank you, Ishanji.
[133:02.86]Really appreciate it.
[133:03.54]They say, I was going to ask you if you realize you've been baited into playing a game that's basically just a short joke.
[133:09.77]But then you confused candy for fruit and asked if dropping an iPad into a tub would kill you.
[133:16.44]So, yeah.
[133:17.62]jermaIQ.
[133:18.46]Here's to my favorite sentry gun.
[133:21.45]P.S.
[133:22.11]I guarantee you aren't pro gamer enough to build a tower of mammoth tusks that can reach the sun in the PS1 Caveman game, Tale of the Sun.
[133:35.52]Whatever.
[133:36.92]Thanks for the hundred dollars.
[133:38.30]That's a lot of money.
[133:41.48]New challenge.
[133:42.18]I'll have to remember that.
[133:47.68]You got baited into a giant short joke.
[133:49.74]That's fine.
[133:52.98]But thanks a lot for the 10,000 bits.
[133:54.36]This one's for you.
[133:55.14]You can't do it.
[134:08.07]I can't do it.
[134:08.75]But I'm going to.
[134:15.56]The Lord of the Rings and the Fellowship of the Ring.
[134:18.34]Uh, refund the game?
[134:23.09]This game was just 20 fucking years old.
[134:25.44]Alright.
[134:26.34]One ring.
[134:26.70]How do I turn?
[134:27.08]How do I use the one ring?
[134:45.35]Hey, remember the final Lord of the Rings?
[134:47.57]Where Frodo ran from a pack of wolves?
[134:51.61]Does this happen?
[135:11.96]Use the ring.
[135:13.42]I can't use the one ring.
[135:14.58]There's no buttons to do anything.
[135:16.60]Wait.
[135:19.98]Did I put it on?
[135:37.52]Just run.
[135:38.26]You have to activate it.
[135:39.26]How do you activate it?
[135:40.06]Equip it with circle.
[135:45.27]Circle.
[135:46.57]Circle.
[136:00.52]You threw the gring- I didn't throw it on the ground.
[136:26.46]I gotta go.
[136:27.18]I have to leave.
[136:29.84]I think I just have to run.
[136:31.06]I have to run.
[136:32.35]I have to run.
[136:34.13]To where though?
[136:36.41]Am I going the right way?
[136:59.15]Un-fucking-gree-wait.
[137:02.32]Is this Ryan?
[137:02.96]Is this wrong?
[137:08.84]Is this wrong?
[137:13.67]This is wrong.
[137:23.99]I know that sword that is the goblin cleaver.
[137:30.66]Bright as daylight.
[137:34.06]Another dark rider.
[137:36.58]I must stay hidden.
[137:38.61]It's not the right movie?
[137:39.55]Oh.
[137:51.49]Do this bullet drop.
[137:52.49]Use the bullet drop to my advantage.
[138:04.68]Just give him the ring.
[138:05.88]I can't just give him the ring.
[138:08.96]Do you understand how much trouble I'd get in?
[138:15.71]Wait, I have an idea.
[138:17.39]I can hide behind this big log.
[138:19.25]Alright, let's get...
[138:23.11]Where is he?
[138:24.94]Oh my god, get in the log!
[138:26.10]Yee!
[138:26.28]Where is he?
[138:33.84]Save in the log.
[138:35.46]No, I'm gonna softlock myself if I save in here.
[138:37.34]He's, like, still right here.
[138:38.66]Does he know I'm in here?
[138:40.68]Okay, I swear to god, there was a Winnie the Pooh episode where this happened.
[138:45.52]What about...
[138:59.86]Rock.
[139:24.13]I'm trying to walk right now, but it won't activate.
[139:29.83]I hit the horse in the head!
[139:30.95]No!
[139:31.25]Is he coming?
[140:08.97]I did it!
[140:12.05]Where are they?
[140:14.42]I did it.
[140:16.96]Fuck yeah.
[140:19.03]Frodo!
[140:19.83]There he is.
[140:20.81]The old sluggard.
[140:21.95]What kept you, cousin?
[140:23.23]Stopped by the Green Dragon on your way out?
[140:25.33]Never mind why.
[140:26.58]But I can't stay.
[140:27.42]I have to leave right now.
[140:29.68]For Krikolo.
[140:30.90]You mean Rivendell.
[140:32.16]And we're coming with you.
[140:33.54]You thought you were so clever.
[140:35.22]But our conspiracy outsmarted you.
[140:37.60]We know all about the Ring and the Dark Lord.
[140:40.30]So we're going.
[140:41.34]To protect you.
[140:43.02]Do you have sticks?
[140:44.66]How could we not know?
[140:46.03]With you muttering, will I ever see that valley again?
[140:49.89]Bring your best stick, Mary.
[140:52.81]I love food.
[140:53.23]Look at how useful I am.
[140:54.23]Bilbo put on the ring and vanished.
[141:00.52]We kept our eyes open after that.
[141:03.04]We spied on you with Gandalf.
[141:04.64]I'm going to eat double the rations from our troop.
[141:07.88]Until he got caught.
[141:09.04]And Gandalf did say, take those as you can trust.
[141:12.38]It seems I can't trust anyone.
[141:14.16]You can trust us to stick with you to the bitter end.
[141:16.70]We've kept your secret better than you did.
[141:18.82]But you can't trust us to let you face danger alone.
[141:21.54]Even though we're horribly afraid.
[141:23.94]He's not C-3PO?
[141:25.82]Or following after like hounds.
[141:27.48]Oh!
[141:27.90]Master Frodo.
[141:29.55]Yes, they are.
[141:30.85]Please.
[141:33.57]Are you honestly trying to tell me that Merry and Pippin are not the C-3PO of Lord of the Rings?
[141:37.22]Are you out of your mind?
[141:46.10]What's all this chatter at this hour of the night?
[141:48.84]Speak up!
[141:49.46]Good evening, Mr. Maggot.
[141:51.78]Well, if it isn't Peregrine Took.
[141:54.94]You're lucky I know you.
[141:56.81]I was about to set my dogs loose.
[141:58.93]The most outlandish fellow rode through here, asking strange questions.
[142:04.57]Here, who's that with you, Pippin?
[142:06.54]You remember Mariadoc Brandybuck.
[142:08.70]Allow me to introduce Samwise Gamgee and... Frodo Baggins.
[142:15.20]Good to see you again, sir.
[142:16.66]Baggins.
[142:17.89]Now, isn't that strangest of all?
[142:20.77]What do you think that stranger was asking about?
[142:23.33]He came riding up on a black horse in black cloak and hood, and he asked for Baggins' home.
[142:31.05]That would be a different Baggins.
[142:33.12]I told him all the Bagginses are in Hobbiton.
[142:36.22]He says Baggins is heading east on foot, and now Frodo Baggins shows up on my farm.
[142:42.72]The same Frodo Baggins who was one of the worst- Who framed Roger Rabbit, seriously?
[142:47.12]I'm just one of the weasels.
[142:48.36]Frodo's-
[142:49.20]Much better behaved these days.
[142:50.73]I am about to embrace it.
[142:51.71]Where are you headed?
[142:53.15]To my new home in Crick Hollow.
[142:54.99]I can see you're in trouble, Frodo.
[142:57.41]You should never have gotten mixed up with those strange Hobbiton folk.
[143:01.29]I wager that Outlander has come for the gold Bilbo brought back from foreign parts.
[143:06.92]Well, I think it's time we were going.
[143:09.60]No, he'll be waiting.
[143:11.44]You ride out in my wagon, hidden from sight.
[143:14.59]Thank you, sir.
[143:15.57]It's a pity I've been in terror of your dogs.
[143:18.05]I've missed a good friend.
[143:19.03]Didn't I kill one of his dogs?
[143:20.65]Shall we go now?
[143:21.77]I'll ready the wagon.
[143:24.10]Farmer Maggot's wagon carried us safely away from his farm and into the borders of Buckland.
[143:28.76]But the Black Rider was still thundering along the East Road.
[143:32.32]We decided to go south and cut through the old forest.
[143:35.82]Merry had been in the old forest and knew a little of its ways.
[143:39.31]It's a dark, mysterious place, but not as dangerous as a Black Rider.
[143:43.45]Did it.
[143:50.40]I did it!
[143:50.78]I beat the first... I beat the first level!
[143:57.46]In the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring.
[144:06.79]I don't feel fulfilled at all.
[144:08.93]Zero fulfillment.
[144:11.77]I'm gonna get those 100 bits.
[144:12.81]Oh wait, what happened?
[144:18.26]What do you mean?
[144:21.58]Did I get cut-scened out of the first level?
[144:23.00]Um... So I didn't do it.
[144:23.98]I... Saved the game.
[144:25.40]Holy fuck, you're right.
[144:54.56]You did.
[144:55.02]This is level 2.
[144:56.14]Did I?
[144:57.18]Jermoth, you're torturing us.
[144:58.48]What?
[144:59.16]What do you mean it's torture?
[145:10.17]I want to play as Gandalf.
[145:11.79]I just want to play one time as Gandalf.
[145:15.91]Seriously.
[145:19.19]Just play the two towers.
[145:20.95]I know, but I just... Alright.
[145:23.77]Play Half-Life 1, ResidentSleeper.
[145:25.35]You would ResidentSleeper Half-Life 1.
[145:27.03]I know you would.
[145:31.95]I would get to the first... I would be walking around in the first part of Half-Life 1.
[145:35.89]Oh, Gordon, it's good to see you again.
[145:38.97]And I would just see ResidentSleepers.
[145:40.89]The entire chat would be ResidentSleepers.
[145:43.55]This forest, it's as if it had a mind of its own.
[145:49.98]Ah!
[145:51.64]Is that the sun?
[145:54.11]Oh man, I don't like that.
[145:55.15]That sucks.
[145:57.43]The f- What is- Oh fuck, that hurt!
[146:05.51]Help!
[146:05.75]L8!
[146:06.21]Block.
[146:06.79]Did I kill it?
[146:25.17]Say the line, say the line, say the line!
[146:31.61]G-g-g-g-g-g-giant!
[146:34.29]G-g-g-g-g-g-giant!
[146:40.13]Spock, enemy!
[146:44.38]Where are they?
[146:51.80]Over here!
[146:52.54]We're over here!
[146:54.48]This way!
[146:55.20]I found him.
[146:56.52]Watch out for the spider!
[147:07.17]This one's smaller.
[147:11.08]Oh, this one sucks.
[147:15.76]Wait, do you fight with me?
[147:22.65]I have a party now?
[147:24.31]Hold on, I get s- I have a party.
[147:26.87]That's pretty sick.
[147:28.73]Alright, get over here, Sam.
[147:37.66]Sam?
[147:39.58]Fight!
[147:43.24]Fight!
[147:47.67]Is he?
[147:49.49]Kill him.
[147:54.35]False fangs in his head.
[147:56.79]Can he die?
[147:57.35]He's getting fucking destroyed.
[148:09.62]My god, he sucks.
[148:11.49]Yes, he does.
[148:12.65]Alright, I can't get off the road.
[148:18.23]Giant enemy spider.
[148:20.39]Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[148:34.24]That was the orchestral remix.
[148:50.57]Okay.
[148:54.87]Uh, what did I find?
[148:56.01]Do I just have to keep walking around in a circle?
[149:03.83]Morty.
[149:04.63]Big bits, big bits, big bits!
[149:06.21]We have five thousand.
[149:09.61]Fifty dollars from the Mean Machine.
[149:11.55]Five thousand bits.
[149:12.39]Thank you, Mean Machine.
[149:14.27]For your fucking ridiculous amount of money.
[149:23.07]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[149:26.33]Uh, for the love of all that is holy, Jerma, you finished the first level of the game.
[149:31.17]I am literally paying you 25 times the wager of that bet for you to go play with Joel instead of dragging this out.
[149:38.63]Holy shit.
[149:43.55]It's not about the money.
[149:46.65]It's about sending a message.
[150:03.89]Well, if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[150:09.14]I hate this game.
[150:10.50]I do.
[150:10.96]I do.
[150:11.24]You're right.
[150:11.64]I hate this game.
[150:12.54]I do.
[150:12.88]I hate it.
[150:13.42]But if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[150:25.71]But you're not good at it.
[150:26.57]Oh, I found Pippin!
[150:34.13]Alright, now who do we need to find?
[150:36.77]He's only playing games for money.
[150:41.06]No one's good at this game.
[150:44.22]Now who do we need?
[150:44.74]We have... Sam... We have Sam... Merry.
[150:52.24]And we have Sam... Alright.
[150:53.22]We just have to walk around in a circle till we find him.
[150:57.51]Speedrunners... Is it people speedrun this game?
[150:58.93]Are there actually speedruns of Lord of the Rings and the Battleship of the Ring?
[151:07.25]Yeah?
[151:10.53]See, that's the real play.
[151:13.02]You find a game that has nobody playing it.
[151:17.62]And even if you, like, you could have a really... You could have a kind of sloppy PB, and it could be the world record.
[151:24.28]And you're just like, fuck that.
[151:25.32]Who the hell else is gonna play Lord of the Rings besides me?
[151:37.40]Alright, is he over here?
[151:56.71]Lost?
[151:57.07]Well, I mean, this is called the Lost Forest or something, isn't it?
[152:01.13]That's the whole point.
[152:03.65]I have to use the sun.
[152:04.67]I heard somebody scream over here.
[152:07.13]I'm getting close.
[152:07.91]I'm getting close.
[152:08.63]I'm getting close Mm-hmm.
[152:11.68]I'm getting close I'm getting close Mm-hmm My friend did that with the Hello Kitty GameCube game
[152:41.16]Good, good.
[152:42.14]Get a world record.
[152:43.84]Alright, what do you think is a game that exists, that if you just sort of beat it slightly quickly, you would have the world record for the game?
[152:53.55]Should we try to figure that out?
[152:55.61]What if I found a game that nobody cared about and nobody played, that I could actually just get be the world record holder, because I beat it slightly faster than normal, because I'm the only one that cared.
[153:14.96]Lord of the Rings.
[153:16.99]No.
[153:17.65]That's not real.
[153:22.13]Alright.
[153:24.71]Super Frog?
[153:26.47]Nancy Drew?
[153:31.49]Make a route for... I'd screw it up.
[153:35.66]Where is this other character before I lose my mind?
[153:40.53]Do Superman 64?
[153:41.71]I wouldn't know.
[153:42.31]Are you kidding me?
[153:43.25]That's like one of the most iconic shitty games ever.
[153:46.56]Somebody already beat that and did that like a thousand times.
[153:54.63]Use your map.
[153:55.11]Map doesn't do anything.
[154:01.87]The world record for this game is 58 minutes.
[154:05.08]So slightly longer than I've played.
[154:06.80]Slightly shorter than I've... Well, whatever.
[154:09.70]Dead spiders means you've been there.
[154:11.04]I know.
[154:11.28]I'm trying to find a live spider.
[154:17.11]Oh.
[154:19.23]Two mushrooms.
[154:19.79]This could be an indicator that I haven't been here.
[154:23.03]Harry?
[154:23.35]Harry!
[154:25.39]Harry!
[154:31.08]There are no Nancy Drew speedruns.
[154:33.08]I never thought potatoes could smell so good.
[154:35.74]A good meal will definitely ease my mind about this place.
[154:38.92]But where is this place?
[154:40.98]Very close to the Withy Window Valley.
[154:42.72]But we shouldn't get any closer.
[154:45.06]Why not?
[154:45.76]The Withy Window Valley seems to be the strangest part of the whole forest.
[154:49.70]Yes is online.
[154:51.42]5,000 bits.
[154:51.80]Oh my god, this music is just bootleg Firelink Shrine.
[154:54.98]Omega Lult.
[154:56.34]Please stop this madness.
[154:57.64]You already missed the pip and skip.
[154:59.18]It's like they're leading us there.
[155:00.83]Mary thought he knew his way around this forest, but how can anyone find their way when the forest won't stand still?
[155:06.57]Do you know one of those trees stuck a branch out at me?
[155:09.49]Nearly tripped me, it did.
[155:10.91]I'm sorry I led us into such a dangerous place, but at least you're shaking off that black rider.
[155:17.63]Dude, missed pip and skip.
[155:24.82]What does it say?
[155:27.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[155:28.84]What does it say?
[155:30.70]This is important.
[155:31.26]This says... I literally just watched you beat up several spiders with a stick for the past 30 minutes.
[155:36.26]I'm going to haunt you until you sell your 30 minutes of life force to me.
[155:40.32]Did you get it?
[156:05.78]That was 28, but it's alright.
[156:09.38]The extra two minutes were on you for clicking on the stream in the first place.
[156:30.30]I broke the audio?
[156:32.80]Oh, there we go.
[156:35.85]Where are we going?
[156:36.67]I wasn't paying any attention to the last cutscene.
[156:41.73]I didn't see one single line.
[156:43.26]Can't go on.
[156:46.28]No, don't go into the puppies!
[156:48.94]It's cool under the windows.
[156:56.23]Less flies.
[157:02.01]Well, that's a real giant enemy spider.
[157:04.13]Oh, no, it's not.
[157:04.55]It's a tree.
[157:05.01]I thought it was a huge spider.
[157:06.13]Giant enemy tree.
[157:06.77]The sequel's never as good.
[157:08.29]The sequel's never as good.
[157:09.95]The sequel's never as good.
[157:12.05]Is he dead?
[157:33.08]Oh my god, I have to save him.
[157:33.68]No, he's about to hit me.
[158:11.22]Alright Not fair not fair that was unfair Okay, stop playing this game, please.
[158:26.55]We're at the first boss We're at the first boss.
[158:30.74]I gotta continue.
[158:31.82]Oh
[158:39.62]Bed of Chaos.
[158:43.14]Wait, that's wrong.
[158:45.96]Why am I walking?
[158:54.38]Who's walking?
[158:55.10]Alright, go in.
[159:25.46]He squeezed him?
[159:27.29]What, am I just supposed to run around in a circle?
[159:28.61]Do I have to get him stuck?
[159:32.63]They're watching your stream because they're... Whatever.
[159:35.51]Alright, I don't... What am I supposed to do?
[159:38.43]One ring?
[159:38.75]Alright, these dudes even got... Dudes got a magic ring on.
[159:50.26]And I can't walk by this.
[160:19.86]Had the ring on for too long.
[160:20.95]Alright, so I'm gonna say throw and then climb up or jump or...
[160:30.20]Did I just get double tapped?
[160:33.64]What about Sam over there?
[160:34.68]What, go wake up Sam?
[160:48.28]Who's lying on the ground over here?
[160:50.20]Someone's lying on the ground right here.
[160:51.14]What if I just don't move?
[161:07.28]Uh, did I get grabbed?
[161:12.99]Hit him in the hand.
[161:22.79]Did you see how big that hitbox is?
[161:24.27]Okay.
[161:39.48]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[161:46.75]I can't go anywhere.
[161:50.72]Run around him?
[161:51.42]What do you mean?
[161:53.52]There's a...
[162:14.46]Alright, I hit his hand.
[162:24.73]He's got me every time, man.
[162:26.49]That wasn't even close!
[162:46.63]Wait, he did...
[163:23.50]I can't even hurt him!
[163:31.20]Use Gold Pine Resin.
[163:38.08]I... Why can't I hurt him?
[163:41.84]Should I just put the ring on and attack him or something?
[163:57.33]I'm invisible.
[163:57.95]You can't see me.
[163:58.51]Alright, so you can't see me.
[163:59.56]So grab him.
[164:01.22]Can I get up here?
[164:03.84]Take it off, take it off, take it off.
[164:12.45]Um...
[164:26.18]Fucking most celebrated franchise in all of human history.
[164:35.47]Keep hitting the hand?
[164:36.43]I hit the hand like 20 times and not one point of damage.
[165:02.83]I can't even imagine.
[165:05.61]Can you ever even imagine deflating this?
[165:10.21]I would cry if I was a kid.
[165:15.02]Don't walk on the holes?
[165:16.60]Alright, do I need to zoom in and show you this?
[165:20.76]You guys, you gotta check your glasses on this one.
[165:22.82]Alright, don't step on the hole.
[165:24.38]Sure.
[165:24.88]I won't do that.
[165:28.10]Oh.
[165:29.22]That's interesting.
[165:30.49]Want me to zoom in?
[165:31.71]Should I zoom into that?
[165:32.93]Let's zoom in.
[165:41.65]Let's take a look.
[165:43.73]I just have to get lucky and get flown over here.
[166:06.38]This is the equivalent of dying to Pinwheel.
[166:08.22]Do you need me to zoom in?
[166:08.96]I'll zoom in.
[166:12.04]Stay in the grass and not the dirt.
[166:20.05]What?
[166:22.63]I can't go anywhere.
[166:25.89]I'm fucked.
[166:30.76]I think I have...
[166:36.42]Duck it.
[166:36.78]See?
[166:37.00]You see what I have to do?
[166:37.74]I have to trigger that cutscene so I appear in front of him.
[167:00.76]Hit the hand.
[167:01.78]Do you need me to zoom in?
[167:03.64]Do you need me to zoom in?
[167:05.83]You didn't even zoom in on the hand.
[167:07.79]Hit the hand.
[167:09.15]Look at the HP bar.
[167:09.85]You didn't even zoom in for it?
[167:14.63]HP bar, look.
[167:15.51]Want to zoom in?
[167:37.73]How did I get hit?
[167:45.11]I haven't moved.
[168:16.87]I missed his hand.
[168:17.87]I hit him in the armpit.
[168:19.51]Fuck.
[168:25.96]I was trying to time it so it was instant frame perfect.
[169:06.25]I can't tell if I'm doing damage or anything.
[169:08.25]I have no idea what's going on.
[169:30.92]Why didn't anybody tell me this was so loud?
[169:33.14]Why didn't anybody tell me this was this loud?
[169:34.66]Why didn't you tell me it was that loud?
[169:38.46]Nobody told me it was that loud.
[169:39.77]This has been, this is extreme loud.
[169:42.11]That was ridiculous.
[169:43.67]That was horrendous.
[169:52.24]This is not working.
[169:53.20]This is not how you do it.
[169:54.80]This isn't how you do it.
[170:02.94]Oh no.
[170:25.85]There's no way.
[170:26.47]This is absolutely not a chance in hell this is the way you do it.
[170:57.91]No, it's not no, it's not I can't do this anymore hit the tree while you're invisible Thanks
[171:33.83]Throw a rock at him in order to get past his roots without getting hurt.
[171:36.86]Then avoid his hands which slam on the ground and hit his hands with your stick as soon as they touch the ground.
[171:41.28]Keep doing this while running back and forth from side to side while getting knocked to the ground.
[171:44.88]After doing this for a time, Tom Babaldi appears and puts Old Man Willow to rest.
[172:07.29]That didn't even come fucking close.
[172:22.16]I'm trying to run away from him.
[172:24.52]This game is so bad.
[172:26.86]This game is so bad.
[172:28.24]This game is very bad.
[172:30.36]This game is very bad.
[172:35.79]Oh no!
[172:36.13]Somebody fell off down in the Lego well!
[172:39.37]Get the helicopter to save Lego City!
[172:42.48]Wait!
[172:43.40]Hold on!
[172:45.52]Where is it?
[172:48.70]We need to get the... This is Lego City Helicopter 22441.
[172:55.00]We need to land the helicopter down and pick up the guy.
[172:58.60]I got funny fucking voices now.
[173:15.55]I know like a lot of people cried when they watched Lord of the Rings and when they read Lord of the Rings.
[173:21.35]Imagine crying to the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring, the video game, not because the story is touching you.
[173:27.81]Because the tree boss is the worst boss you've ever played in a video game and it makes you sad.
[173:45.88]childhood ruining okay I have to stop I have no I don't not yet I broke an arm hold on does it work I threw I didn't even mean to oh my goodness it's okay
[174:16.01]I'm gonna sneeze.
[174:17.01]There's nothing I can do about it.
[174:24.37]Ow.
[174:25.33]It hurt my back.
[174:41.23]Do it in first... I got the strategy.
[174:43.33]Here's the winning strategy.
[174:44.09]You ready?
[174:59.09]Back up, back up!
[175:00.23]If that was a winning strategy, we'd be fucking... Dammit.
[175:06.29]Come on, closer.
[175:17.82]Closer.
[175:25.04]Closer.
[175:26.40]Wait, just don't move.
[175:33.13]No, I gotta be in first person so I trigger it.
[175:37.61]First person, come on.
[175:42.28]Uh-oh.
[175:45.92]He's baiting me.
[176:30.30]I didn't even get hit by anything in this game.
[176:33.05]I can't believe it.
[176:34.34]I can't believe it.
[177:09.22]Oh my god.
[177:13.08]Did anyone beat this when they were younger?
[177:16.74]I don't know if I would be able to.
[177:18.22]If you're like 12, I don't think you even know what to do.
[177:21.36]I think you just get killed like five times.
[177:23.50]I don't think anybody does.
[177:51.86]I'll send you money equals my student loan debt if you stop playing this game.
[177:55.07]Pay your student loans, don't pay me.
[178:17.00]Oh, steady there, little fellows.
[178:19.49]Where be you gone to?
[178:20.59]Where did you come from?
[178:22.83]What's the matter then?
[178:24.41]Come now, tell me what's your trouble.
[178:26.95]My friends are caught in that willow tree.
[178:28.63]They're being crushed.
[178:30.53]I know the rhyme for him.
[178:33.46]I'll chat his marrow cold if he don't behave himself.
[178:36.30]You let them out again, old man willow.
[178:38.94]You should not be waking.
[178:41.52]Eat Earth, drink water, go to sleep.
[178:46.19]Bombadil is talking.
[178:47.79]Yes.
[178:55.49]Thank you.
[178:56.27]Very much.
[178:57.47]Well, my little fellows, you shall come to the house of Tom Bombadil.
[179:02.71]Where?
[179:03.23]Time enough for questions around the supper table.
[179:06.35]Come now and help Tom find lilies for fair Lady Goldberry.
[179:09.99]After that, we shall sit down to a table laden with cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter.
[179:17.07]Warm butter?
[179:17.99]The sooner we find lilies, the sooner we can eat.
[179:24.98]Look at that stride.
[179:27.40]Find 12 lilies.
[179:49.06]Okay, we're- I love this comment.
[179:51.52]Okay, now we're done now, please.
[179:55.00]Okay, we're done.
[179:57.94]Excuse me?
[179:59.50]Excuse me?
[180:00.12]Is this guy... Is he gonna... Is he... People... Tom.
[180:17.16]Tom, turn around.
[180:18.78]Tom.
[180:20.34]Tom, there's a spider behind you.
[180:23.93]Look behind you quick.
[180:25.81]Oh, no.
[180:26.07]He has ear pods and he can't hear us Okay, where did these all come from?
[180:30.81]What the fuck?
[180:31.75]I have to find 12 lilies
[180:48.91]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[180:50.55]I don't know if we'll be doing this one.
[180:52.31]How many is this one here?
[180:54.71]Oh, Jesus.
[180:56.83]Jesus Christ.
[180:58.83]Why is the entire hive coming after us?
[181:13.29]What?
[181:13.57]Okay, I feel like I'm playing Dragon Age.
[181:18.27]This is just dogshit Dragon Age with no pause.
[181:37.33]We did it!
[181:38.05]Nice job, guys!
[181:39.27]You did a great job.
[181:45.77]Quick, turn it off.
[181:48.42]Turn it off.
[181:48.86]Turn it off.
[181:49.38]Turn it off.
[182:05.19]I'll read a bedtime story if you stop.
[182:06.81]How am I going to hear it?
[182:08.35]This shouldn't be too hard.
[182:16.54]Joel got rejected for this.
[182:18.38]Oh, we're just gonna do it on another day.
[182:35.25]What is that?
[182:35.87]Good thing I'm wearing a diaper.
[182:41.53]I don't know.
[182:42.15]Whose clip is this?
[182:47.97]I don't get it Wow, how many do I need?
[183:08.86]Come on, I need my Dragon Age friends
[183:16.11]Oh, actually, you know how this is more accurate?
[183:18.85]You're playing an MMO, you're really desperately trying to play an MMO with three of your friends, who just made new characters, and they don't know a goddamn thing about the fucking game.
[183:29.80]And they're just watching you destroy everything.
[183:33.40]And they are just following you around.
[183:35.28]Yeah, uh, it's over here.
[183:40.56]Did you guys, how many you guys have?
[183:43.63]I have two.
[183:45.13]Oh, I have all of them already.
[183:46.81]I'm not going to say that, though.
[183:47.81]How many do you have?
[183:48.61]Three.
[183:49.59]What about you?
[183:50.28]Four.
[183:50.94]Okay, cool.
[183:51.46]I have all 12.
[183:53.16]I think I saw some more over here.
[183:55.46]Yeah, I have six.
[183:58.20]I'm still hard to find them, you know.
[184:01.14]Over here.
[184:01.48]Come over this way.
[184:02.10]I think there's some over here.
[184:12.90]And you got that one friend that just keeps casting the same buff.
[184:16.74]And they're the healer.
[184:19.82]It's like, you've been buffed.
[184:21.66]You had 58 minutes remaining from 60 minutes.
[184:25.65]That's not the heal.
[184:26.67]You're doing the wrong button.
[184:28.57]I'm not going to say anything.
[184:40.24]You get the one friend that dies in every fight.
[184:43.92]Every single fight.
[184:45.30]And thank God that you decided that you were going to play a character with a rez.
[184:49.58]Because if you didn't, you would not be playing with these friends.
[184:58.85]Without a doubt, in your mind, if you don't play a character that can take care of everybody, you ain't playing.
[185:16.92]Your Otto voice and your stupid voice are the same.
[185:19.06]Are you implying that Otto is stupid?
[185:22.19]No, I'm implying that Otto is a dog.
[185:35.21]The worst part about playing MMOs, especially with people that don't really care, is a lot of people just don't get it.
[185:43.55]And a lot of your friends will treat an MMO like they're playing a game of Madden.
[185:49.21]Alright, let's go.
[185:50.31]Let's go on a quest.
[185:52.45]30 minutes goes by.
[185:53.07]Alright, that was kind of fun.
[185:57.41]I gotta go, though.
[185:59.72]okay yeah um that's not you can't really play for 30 minutes we just did one quest and I'm gonna like over level the fuck out of you if you log off right now what's I'm just gonna sell my stuff and then leave
[186:21.79]Fuck.
[186:22.55]When he logs back on, I'm gonna be like 20 fucking levels higher than him.
[186:26.40]So what you do is you make another character, you make an alt for your alt, so you can continue to play, and then pretend like you didn't play, and log on the other character that your friend was playing with.
[186:40.51]And then eventually, that second character you made becomes your main character, and your friend never plays again past level 12.
[186:51.94]And you knew that was going to happen.
[186:53.44]You knew it.
[186:53.78]But you tried anyway.
[187:07.73]That animation is so brutal.
[187:09.43]Alright, how many more do I need?
[187:14.22]I don't even know how many I have.
[187:17.62]Okay, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[187:17.98]I need 3 more.
[187:25.80]Two?
[187:26.88]Come on.
[187:28.44]Damn it.
[187:30.92]Did I miss some?
[187:34.10]You had to count to 12.
[187:38.49]We want Bugleberry.
[187:39.81]We want Bugleberry.
[187:41.01]We want Bugleberry.
[187:44.35]One person wants Bugleberry, and they really, really want it.
[187:53.27]No one wants that.
[187:57.35]It don't matter you're gonna it's like a bugle berries gonna return I'm gonna put him in as many fucking things as I can Alright, come on let's go Where are you guys get over here?
[188:20.74]Where are they?
[188:21.32]Oh?
[188:28.11]They're not even gonna be in range for the kills.
[188:41.73]They're turning their quests in.
[188:47.43]Alright, here they are.
[188:49.35]Three more.
[188:57.67]Come on, please.
[188:58.61]Dude, why'd you go back to town?
[189:09.28]He only finished quest one out of five.
[189:14.48]You go to this person's house.
[189:16.10]This is the best part.
[189:17.96]So you eventually go to this friend's house.
[189:22.05]And they are on, hey, I'm playing WoW, cool, or I'm playing Final Fantasy, whatever.
[189:27.12]I'm playing, um, whatever game.
[189:30.10]And you open up their log, their quest log.
[189:33.06]And they have, like, 20, or like 18, gray-ass quests that they never got rid of.
[189:41.55]And you're sitting there going, oh man.
[189:47.52]He just has no idea.
[189:53.60]They could be level 40 and they have a full logbook of shit from the level 10 zone.
[190:02.10]And you go in there and you delete them.
[190:03.70]You delete them for them.
[190:06.07]They don't need to know.
[190:09.03]Delete, delete.
[190:10.47]Stop tracking, stop tracking, stop tracking.
[190:11.87]Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[190:18.44]Oh, I found you.
[190:19.84]There.
[190:22.95]Okay.
[190:23.47]I did it.
[190:24.17]They were doing them for the Lord.
[190:27.19]No.
[190:27.35]They definitely were not.
[190:29.99]How long is this game?
[190:50.55]What?
[190:50.77]Hold on, this game is only five hours long?
[191:08.52]Are you serious?
[191:10.12]I'm not gonna beat it.
[191:12.70]I'm just saying.
[191:13.80]I thought it was gonna be longer than that.
[191:16.62]Speaking of World of Warcraft, that is... That is a default...
[191:36.78]mage, like level 2 green that she's wearing.
[191:39.08]She actually is.
[191:39.66]I'm sorry, I'm on that now.
[191:41.18]Stop making wild ref... I... I'm just... It's my brain!
[192:04.99]Thank You Tom Bombadil
[192:32.71]Okay, can we please play as Aragorn?
[192:34.81]Take the ring to Rivendell.
[192:35.57]Okay, let's go.
[193:03.92]Hi guys.
[193:05.02]Rivendell.
[193:10.55]Is this the road to Rivendell?
[193:12.41]I don't know.
[193:14.57]Save it, holy shit.
[193:15.51]You're right, I haven't saved it in a long ass time.
[193:18.65]You are absolutely a thousand percent correct.
[193:28.48]You should shred this game.
[193:30.80]No, I can't do that.
[193:32.96]I can't do that.
[193:39.91]Don't tell him to save, it makes him more invested.
[193:41.81]Whoever keeps telling him to save, there is a special place in hell for you.
[193:59.78]Oh my god, Jesus.
[194:02.49]Big dog.
[194:06.35]Big dog, here we go.
[194:08.52]Alright, the next area, I'm done.
[194:11.40]I promise.
[194:11.78]I beat the first area, I get to win.
[194:21.68]I swear to God.
[194:22.94]I promise.
[194:25.01]This next area, I'm done with Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring.
[194:34.57]Aragorn is next.
[194:36.73]I don't think that's... I'm gonna die.
[194:45.61]You have to beat this.
[194:48.96]No, nobody really actually wants me to do that.
[194:52.48]I know it for a fact.
[194:58.14]I know it for a fact.
[195:03.85]This is a chill game.
[195:05.05]You know, somebody just said this.
[195:06.31]It is strangely intriguing.
[195:08.35]And it is, like, oddly common to be playing this and just hanging out.
[195:12.15]Play a good Lord of the Rings game?
[195:13.29]I have all of them.
[195:14.79]I have two towers.
[195:16.25]I have Return of the King.
[195:21.03]I have them both.
[195:26.79]Go to the get just play two towers now, but we don't know the story.
[195:29.27]What about the Hobbit game?
[195:42.34]No.
[195:43.98]We're not far from the main road, by my reckoning.
[195:46.54]Splendid.
[195:47.66]If we keep this pace, we'll leave the Barrow Downs by sunset tomorrow.
[195:51.55]Not soon enough for my liking.
[195:53.65]I don't trust what's hiding in the fog on the Barrow Downs.
[195:57.05]You don't believe stories about all dead Barrowites.
[196:00.78]Was there ever a TV show for Lord of the Rings?
[196:03.66]I'm surprised the answer is no.
[196:05.38]A cartoon.
[196:06.20]I could see a cartoon.
[196:20.16]I don't like spending the night among these burial stones.
[196:23.19]They look like giant teeth coming up from the ground.
[196:26.11]If half the stories I've heard about the Barrow Downs are true, we'll need to keep a careful watch.
[196:31.34]Enough storytelling.
[196:32.30]Let's get to sleep.
[196:41.02]No, I don't want to go fetch.
[196:45.82]I don't want to go fetch.
[196:47.08]We already did this.
[196:50.50]You've already done this.
[196:51.84]I've already done this.
[196:53.44]Alright, that's it.
[196:57.98]That's it.
[196:59.15]That's it.
[196:59.37]I'm going to quit the game.
[197:04.32]I said I'm quitting the game.
[197:05.86]You said you were done, and then when you got to a new area, I know, I'm quitting the game.
[197:10.02]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[197:15.23]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[197:17.51]I did it, I did it, I'm done.
[197:22.11]I did, I'm done.
[197:22.79]I did it, I'm already done.
[197:26.76]I'm not even playing right now.
[197:28.30]This is one of those games where if you stop playing for too long, Mario just, like, starts doing weird animations and shit.
[197:33.04]I'm not doing this.
[197:36.65]I don't- I have no idea where I'm going.
[197:47.86]Double or nothing?
[197:48.46]That's a- no.
[197:49.26]That's not how this works.
[197:52.92]No, no, no.
[197:53.64]I'm done.
[197:54.00]I'm done.
[197:54.48]I'm done.
[197:54.86]I'm done.
[197:55.40]I'm done.
[197:56.34]That's it.
[197:56.58]I'm done.
[197:57.82]I'm done.
[198:00.04]I just left him.
[198:01.60]Fuck him.
[198:02.30]Bye!
[198:05.00]Still alive.
[198:11.25]I did what I came to do.
[198:20.07]What's next?
[198:29.01]Just in case I ever decide to come back.
[198:32.18]I might decide to come back one day.
[198:41.55]He did not beat it.
[198:42.79]That was the first part.
[198:46.28]The first part was after the ring rates.
[198:47.96]Alright, that was cool.
[198:51.56]Alright, what do I want to do for the time being?
[198:57.48]Let's quit.
[198:58.12]Let's get this out of here.
[198:58.90]Alright, give me one.
[199:00.14]You know, it's been a few hours.
[199:00.88]Let me go pee.
[199:01.26]I'll be right back.
[199:02.04]We'll figure out what we're going to do.
[199:03.35]Be right back.
