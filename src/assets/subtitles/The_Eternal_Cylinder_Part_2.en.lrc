[ve:60.16.100]

[00:19.26]I have a quick question.
[00:21.26]If I were to say in a tweet, for instance, like I'm out running something out running the cylinder.
[00:28.10]Is it out space running?
[00:29.78]Or is it out running one word?
[00:30.94]Because the other one implies you you're like out.
[00:37.17]It's one word.
[00:37.65]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:38.37]Alright, here in a minute.
[02:32.03]Alright, let's go.
[02:36.25]Let's go!
[02:36.76]How you doing?
[02:39.42]Just wanted to get my tea.
[02:44.40]Got a nice hot tea here.
[02:46.02]We're going to pick up where we left off a day or two ago.
[02:52.09]Still in the Eternal Cylinder.
[02:55.51]Well, still trying to outrun the Eternal Cylinder.
[02:58.51]Let's get that correct.
[03:02.19]Hold on.
[03:02.45]There we go.
[03:06.20]You finished Elden Ring so fast.
[03:07.86]I mean, we did it.
[03:11.32]Took us four streams.
[03:15.62]Each stream was what?
[03:16.84]Between seven and nine hours?
[03:19.24]Took us like 30, 40 hours to do it.
[03:30.17]There we go.
[03:30.89]Okay.
[03:35.21]Alright, are you ready?
[03:36.79]We're moving.
[03:38.78]Welcome back.
[03:40.84]This game's pretty cute.
[03:42.26]It's really fun.
[03:43.84]Let's keep playing it.
[03:47.10]Do we need a recap for anybody that wasn't here?
[03:50.38]Here's the recap.
[03:51.72]It's very loud for me.
[03:52.90]I'm so glad I turned it down for you.
[03:54.08]Okay.
[03:59.84]Alright, so here's the recap.
[04:01.52]I plugged a controller in too.
[04:02.80]I'm imagining it's probably better this way.
[04:06.02]So, recap.
[04:07.65]There's a gigantic cylinder that is crushing everything.
[04:12.95]I can't.
[04:13.21]We can't.
[04:13.57]We have to move now.
[04:15.01]Alright.
[04:16.01]That thing instantly kills you.
[04:17.89]We lost a couple of friends along the way here.
[04:24.12]The last thing that happened is we went inside.
[04:25.86]We went across.
[04:26.82]I can't.
[04:27.10]We gotta go.
[04:28.10]We actually have to leave, like, right now.
[04:41.54]It's not happening.
[04:42.65]No, I'm sorry.
[04:43.25]That's not happening.
[04:45.29]That's just not happening, guys.
[04:46.37]I'm sorry.
[04:46.75]That's not the way it works.
[04:51.99]We gotta go.
[04:52.45]How do I... Okay, that's how I do it on controller.
[04:58.34]Like this.
[05:01.36]Okay, who's the horn?
[05:05.36]Who's the horn?
[05:05.82]You do, right?
[05:09.06]Who's the horn?
[05:09.64]Somebody has a horn.
[05:11.62]Can't tell.
[05:14.83]Who has the horn?
[05:17.31]Oh, no, you do, you do.
[05:18.17]Okay.
[05:20.81]Do it!
[05:21.47]Blow the horn!
[05:23.91]Fuck off!
[05:28.45]Get out of here!
[05:30.69]Alright, good, good, good.
[05:34.49]Okay.
[05:35.29]So, recap.
[05:37.78]Let's get away from that thing, because that thing is horrible.
[05:42.65]You gotta get away from the cylinder every time you leave this, uh, kind of... dome?
[05:47.90]This kind of, like, Fortnite area?
[05:49.86]The cylinder moves.
[05:55.90]Do I wanna do this?
[05:57.50]This is a goo one.
[05:59.31]Whoa, I actually kind of like that.
[06:00.69]Should I do it?
[06:02.45]How many stakes do we need?
[06:03.19]Six?
[06:05.93]Do I have six stakes?
[06:11.61]I have seven stakes.
[06:12.51]Okay, we can get one.
[06:13.65]Let's do it.
[06:17.01]Whoa, this is cool.
[06:20.33]I like the goo one.
[06:23.09]Alright, let's go.
[06:25.51]It's like orange, white, and green.
[06:27.77]Okay, I feel safer.
[06:35.05]Where's our new friend?
[06:36.24]Oh, no, it's pink and red.
[06:39.80]Very cool.
[06:41.64]Alright.
[06:44.56]Is Gunu dead?
[06:45.80]No, Gunu's right here.
[06:48.24]This is Gunu.
[06:50.40]Everybody hungry?
[06:51.56]We're good?
[06:53.91]I mean, this is a hardcore playthrough.
[06:55.79]If Gunu dies, that's over.
[06:58.23]I leave.
[07:00.87]I would be so distraught if that happens.
[07:02.55]I do kind of have to relearn the game, though.
[07:06.10]Because I'm playing on a controller.
[07:11.11]I would cry.
[07:11.79]Alright, here we go.
[07:15.60]A few steaks.
[07:21.36]You know, get rid of some of this bullshit.
[07:22.45]I don't want all this.
[07:27.28]There we go.
[07:28.56]So, I don't have anything on the map.
[07:29.84]The map is kind of all blurry.
[07:31.48]I think we just have to... We have to just keep going.
[07:32.96]You see the big, uh, lit up kind of Sauron eye?
[07:38.23]We have to go over there.
[07:39.59]We did get a new friend.
[07:41.63]I can't see very much on the map.
[07:42.89]So, I don't know.
[07:44.83]I think we're just gonna go.
[07:48.49]So, I crossed that threshold.
[07:50.09]Now the cylinder moves.
[07:52.93]And you gotta make it to this thing, or you die.
[08:06.24]Come on friends, let's go.
[08:07.04]This is your quick recap.
[08:16.12]The Eternal Cylinder is a pretty fun game.
[08:19.08]I don't know how long the game is, but.
[08:24.93]Wait, oh he's sparkly.
[08:27.79]Yeah, I think it's somewhere between 10 and 15 hours.
[08:36.92]We'll get through it.
[08:42.83]So we made it.
[08:43.47]Let's see what happens now.
[08:48.93]It was so weird going across this thing and seeing the actual huge guy.
[08:52.01]Spoiler alert, but there's a huge guy.
[08:54.89]We got everybody?
[08:55.43]Yep, we got everybody.
[09:05.21]Everybody eat.
[09:08.14]Yeah, the mathematician, yep.
[09:11.43]The mathematician was this weird... What is that thing?
[09:17.93]Okay.
[09:19.93]Alright, we're not going over there.
[09:21.84]I'm not going that way.
[09:25.52]Do I still have a map yet?
[09:26.78]I don't.
[09:29.76]How do I make the map not scrambled?
[09:31.34]I want to be able to see where I can go.
[09:36.55]This time, the trebam knew what they were feeling.
[09:40.90]Here was another servant of the cylinder.
[09:43.40]What?
[09:44.52]But what shape would this creature's evil take?
[09:49.21]It did not seem interested in the trebam.
[09:52.80]The servant of the cylinder had released a swarm.
[09:56.38]Small parasites had come from within it and attached themselves to the creatures in this area.
[10:01.86]I'm ready to burn.
[10:03.04]It was somehow using them to corrupt the tower, to turn its protective force into a trap.
[10:10.19]What?
[10:12.85]All Tribum hate parasites by nature, and they hated these even more.
[10:19.85]Burn.
[10:20.09]Should I burn?
[10:25.49]Alright, I'm gonna try... I'm gonna... Everybody stay back.
[10:28.69]I'm gonna try burning.
[10:37.53]No!
[10:38.95]Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[10:43.98]I don't want anybody to die.
[10:45.14]Um, I wonder how I do this.
[10:50.89]I can't save it here.
[10:59.35]Come on, get it off.
[11:01.19]Alright, it's just water?
[11:02.15]There's one.
[11:12.92]Actually, get it.
[11:13.44]No, no, no.
[11:13.70]Move out of the way.
[11:17.30]Another friend over there.
[11:24.35]Bring it.
[11:27.43]Do we get it?
[11:27.89]I don't think so.
[11:29.55]Where is it?
[11:29.93]Where is it attached?
[11:30.77]On the back?
[11:33.10]Get the fuck out of here.
[11:40.28]No, I don't know.
[11:41.48]I don't know where it is.
[11:42.22]It's like on the back leg.
[11:43.66]Did I get it?
[11:50.81]Okay, I got it.
[11:52.57]Oh!
[11:56.03]It completely missed everybody.
[11:57.75]Holy shit.
[11:59.27]I can't believe nobody got hurt.
[12:04.08]Okay, this is a huge pain in the ass.
[12:15.38]How am I supposed to reliably do this without everybody getting killed?
[12:17.37]Alright, there.
[12:22.83]Got it.
[12:26.62]Okay, it hit its head.
[12:28.70]We're good.
[12:30.30]There's one, two more.
[12:31.96]Or one more.
[12:32.36]I wonder what happens when I do this.
[12:51.66]That's three.
[12:52.08]I think I killed it.
[13:00.65]I killed it.
[13:09.43]Did I?
[13:09.75]Yeah, I think I think it's just dead.
[13:27.13]So true.
[13:29.47]Yeah, true, true.
[13:30.85]Alright, let's go back to Guna.
[13:41.67]Pick up the stuff that you sprayed.
[13:44.32]That's a good idea.
[13:46.40]Wait, what is anything on this?
[13:56.58]The one fell over here.
[14:01.86]Why do you hate Gunu?
[14:02.72]Alright, where is it?
[14:05.18]Over here?
[14:08.65]Is that it?
[14:11.39]I don't think that's it.
[14:21.25]Where did it fall off?
[14:23.21]I was too busy trying to... I was panicking because I didn't want to die.
[14:30.92]Alright, can I get this one?
[14:35.08]Three and... No, I can't.
[14:37.16]Sorry, buddy.
[14:37.52]I don't remember where they are.
[14:47.38]I'm too afraid to investigate anymore.
[14:52.28]Yeah, this is just me dying.
[15:01.92]I'm out of here.
[15:10.04]This is definitely an opportunity where I can pick it up again.
[15:11.74]It's all good.
[15:17.78]Move.
[15:25.05]I wish I had a way to defend myself.
[15:27.21]I want a Trebom that has a fucking gun.
[15:34.18]What does this do again?
[15:40.92]Oh, the... The eyes, okay.
[15:43.90]Um, I think... Does somebody already have this?
[15:49.46]Oh my god, will you leave me the fuck alone?
[15:55.35]I can't even have five seconds to look at the menu.
[15:57.01]Alright, come here.
[16:04.74]You... Hey, new guy.
[16:06.76]This is yours.
[16:07.96]Get up!
[16:10.83]Leave me alone!
[16:11.67]I want... Just move!
[16:13.25]Move!
[16:13.91]Move!
[16:16.58]It's gonna be like a chill night.
[16:24.79]These fucking random ass creatures.
[16:26.99]I want to just blow them up.
[16:30.93]There's no way to go.
[16:32.58]I have to just keep moving.
[16:34.06]If I stop for more than 10 seconds, everybody dies.
[16:35.74]Okay, can you... Eat that.
[16:43.32]Oh my god, leave us alone for one second!
[16:46.57]Leave me fucking alone!
[16:59.69]OK, I'm not going that way yet.
[17:07.36]Use the horn.
[17:09.28]I only have one.
[17:10.22]One of my random assholes has it.
[17:12.14]OK, you have the horn.
[17:13.58]I'm just I'm only playing as this character.
[17:16.20]I think the horn actually pisses them off and makes him more angry sometimes though.
[17:25.10]Oh fuck, I went across the threshold.
[17:26.38]I gotta go.
[17:30.30]Um, what?
[17:36.84]I got time.
[17:45.90]Yeah, this time.
[17:46.38]I got plenty of time.
[17:56.10]No, we're good.
[18:02.01]OK, can they not be like 100 monsters everywhere right now?
[18:08.29]Thank God.
[18:09.97]That was horrible.
[18:14.87]Oh my nope.
[18:15.83]OK, never mind.
[18:16.45]It's about to get way worse.
[18:19.33]Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up.
[18:24.89]OK, where's the next one?
[18:28.75]It's OK, we have to.
[18:29.35]We have to keep it in between us.
[18:32.61]Where... Come on, hurry up!
[18:34.25]Hurry up!
[18:36.07]Face toot!
[18:37.21]Whatever... I don't know what that person's name is.
[18:41.24]Don't fall behind!
[18:42.40]Don't fall behind!
[18:43.34]Come on, you can do it!
[18:45.88]Come on!
[18:47.59]Why is he so slow?
[19:02.32]Keep going.
[19:04.14]Oops.
[19:09.52]We got everybody.
[19:10.24]I think we have everyone.
[19:10.88]Everybody's safe.
[19:12.96]We got to stay close.
[19:19.97]We got that.
[19:20.39]That's fine.
[19:25.25]That thing better not swoop down.
[19:26.85]Do not swoop down.
[19:28.06]Do not swoop down.
[19:29.16]Hold on.
[19:29.50]Where's my friend?
[19:30.54]Where are they?
[19:30.92]Where are they?
[19:31.24]Where are they?
[19:31.90]Come here.
[19:33.52]You.
[19:40.10]Leave.
[19:40.84]Leave us alone.
[19:42.05]Leave us alone.
[19:45.49]Leave us alone.
[19:47.33]Leave us alone.
[19:47.95]Leave us alone.
[19:50.43]Leave us alone.
[19:51.29]We're just trying to survive like you.
[19:53.83]Leave us alone.
[20:02.78]Leave us alone!
[20:06.66]Did he get somebody?
[20:07.94]Oh, shit!
[20:13.78]I think we're okay.
[20:16.84]Do not swoop!
[20:18.30]No!
[20:19.56]No, that's... Oh, no, we're good, we're good.
[20:20.90]He got out, he got out, he got out.
[20:24.11]I can't go too far, because if I go too far, then they get struck by lightning.
[20:26.91]We're alright.
[20:28.13]Stick together.
[20:32.59]You need to look where you're going.
[20:35.07]I know where I'm going.
[20:36.47]I can't go too far though.
[20:43.66]Alright, I'm going too far.
[20:44.62]Get away from us!
[20:51.24]Get out!
[20:51.56]Get out!
[20:51.94]Get out!
[20:52.14]Get out!
[20:53.32]Get out!
[21:02.94]Is everybody okay?
[21:03.89]I think so.
[21:06.87]Almost there.
[21:07.45]I can't.
[21:13.57]Not yet.
[21:13.91]I gotta wait.
[21:14.43]I'm too far ahead.
[21:22.86]I need food.
[21:23.56]Does anybody have any?
[21:26.93]You do.
[21:34.83]Okay.
[21:35.23]And now I'm going to cross it.
[21:39.83]Thank God.
[21:40.37]Alright.
[21:40.61]Please don't have that.
[21:41.43]Keep going.
[21:41.95]If this thing goes down too, I'm going to be so pissed.
[21:44.90]Wait, just in case it doesn't eat food.
[21:50.14]Oh my God.
[21:50.60]There's no vegetation here.
[21:52.20]I mean, this is water, but
[22:06.84]No, no, give... Here you go.
[22:08.10]I'm alright with what?
[22:10.17]This doesn't count as food, right?
[22:16.87]Jesus.
[22:18.53]We good?
[22:22.12]Oh, thank God.
[22:23.30]Okay.
[22:24.78]So for those of you... For those of you who don't know what just happened, sometimes that is not enough to stop the cylinder and it keeps going, but if you go too far, everybody gets struck by lightning and dies.
[22:38.99]Let's eat.
[22:40.57]Oh, thank goodness.
[22:41.15]Everybody fill up.
[22:48.02]Need more than that.
[22:52.58]We're all still so hungry.
[22:53.60]Somebody said, dude, that was not chill.
[23:06.39]No, it wasn't.
[23:07.55]It was not chill.
[23:17.35]That doesn't work.
[23:17.82]It was the worst enemy in the game.
[23:21.06]What did I just do?
[23:31.20]Oh shit, I didn't want to do that.
[23:32.76]I ate the wrong thing.
[23:35.31]Oh!
[23:35.97]Burn him!
[23:36.63]Burn him alive!
[23:37.49]Burn him!
[23:37.89]Somebody burn him!
[23:38.81]Somebody burn this guy!
[23:39.53]Burn him!
[23:40.25]Somebody help me!
[23:41.19]Excuse me, help!
[23:42.07]Somebody burn him!
[23:43.11]Can I help?
[23:43.81]Somebody help me!
[23:44.89]Help me!
[23:45.51]Somebody help!
[23:57.16]Fuck you!
[23:58.68]Fuck you!
[23:59.80]Fuck you!
[24:01.02]Fuck you!
[24:06.08]Gonna take more than that.
[24:10.54]Gonna take more than that to kill.
[24:13.99]We womp.
[24:16.05]Wait.
[24:24.02]Let's go.
[24:29.51]Somebody help me!
[24:30.47]Somebody help me!
[24:31.45]Somebody, what was I doing?
[24:32.61]I was gonna fucking do something.
[24:34.73]I mean, I couldn't do anything, but you know.
[24:36.07]Alright, alright, alright.
[24:36.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:37.65]There's a temple over here.
[24:44.71]Somebody help me!
[24:45.54]Somebody help me!
[24:46.22]They're still hungry.
[24:54.42]I get, there's no chill.
[24:55.64]There's no time for me to chill.
[25:00.05]I want to eat stuff, but these dumb flying enemies just ruin everything.
[25:11.02]Alright, now we're full.
[25:14.86]Cool, let's keep going.
[25:25.27]I forget what this does.
[25:35.16]uh what other side probably oh my god don't even this is dangerous now every day
[26:07.60]There we go.
[26:11.38]This place made the Trebam uncomfortable.
[26:14.95]It felt like a place of desperation.
[26:17.79]Where terrible, bitter things had happened a long, long time ago.
[26:23.55]I'm good on food.
[26:34.56]Let's get topped off.
[26:41.77]What is that?
[26:48.42]Did you just die?
[26:51.30]You alright?
[26:55.29]I can't move.
[26:57.41]No, it doesn't mean all of you don't come over here and investigate it.
[27:00.41]Get out of the way.
[27:01.93]It's okay.
[27:02.39]Alright.
[27:03.09]I got an idea.
[27:32.47]And drop anything.
[27:39.26]Who knew power?
[27:43.62]I wonder.
[27:44.02]Alright, I've got legs on here.
[27:47.16]I've got two flames.
[27:51.42]Does anybody kind of miss it?
[27:52.26]You've got water.
[27:54.44]I'm going to give it to you over here.
[27:56.40]I feel like we can see what it is.
[27:59.68]Better off you getting it.
[28:03.40]Alright, Vu.
[28:06.84]Give it to the new guy?
[28:08.97]Oh, yeah.
[28:09.79]That's right.
[28:10.37]I forgot you existed.
[28:18.09]Alright, moment of truth.
[28:28.12]Sucker feet?
[28:32.46]How do I do that?
[28:39.56]Oh, that's very helpful actually.
[28:43.63]I feel like I want everybody to have that.
[28:45.99]That probably prevents being picked up by the birds.
[28:51.51]I'm going to give that to everybody that doesn't.
[28:53.17]Yeah, let's give it to everybody.
[28:54.18]Somebody has 10 of these.
[28:58.04]Who has it?
[29:01.06]Alright, spread it around.
[29:04.10]You have the stomp feat, so I don't want you to do it, but I want... It's going to replace the jumping.
[29:12.01]You still have jump, though, so I think that's fine.
[29:13.93]I'm going to give it to... Yeah, let's give it to Gunu.
[29:16.37]Gunu?
[29:20.12]I didn't mean to do that.
[29:21.80]I pressed... I pressed the wrong fucking button.
[29:25.99]And this is what happens when you didn't play with the controller last time.
[29:29.71]You played keyboard and mouse, you plugged the controller in.
[29:32.39]So B is like the back button.
[29:42.19]Why am I playing with the controller?
[29:43.13]Because it feels way better than WASD.
[29:47.27]Um...
[29:49.53]Well, that's great.
[29:50.65]I guess I could just... Three minutes?
[29:52.41]That's not that big of a deal.
[30:02.90]Yeah, it's not too bad.
[30:05.38]I think it's when we open the door here.
[30:06.76]It is.
[30:07.00]Okay, so let's just bring... Let's use this stomp.
[30:11.68]There you go.
[30:12.59]Okay.
[30:13.47]Let's go.
[30:15.33]This place made the Trebam uncomfortable.
[30:18.90]It felt like a place of desperation, where terrible, bitter things had happened a long, long time ago.
[30:27.50]I don't want anyone to die.
[30:29.16]Let's see if I can do it right here.
[30:35.73]It just picked somebody up.
[30:37.35]Okay, it was about to, like, eat that person.
[30:40.61]Alright.
[30:41.63]So.
[30:44.21]You are gonna do it.
[30:45.91]So just do it.
[30:49.69]So that's a sticky feet for you.
[30:52.22]He's so much cooler now.
[30:59.38]Alright, I love him even more.
[31:01.62]Alright.
[31:03.55]Uh, sticky feet for you.
[31:06.21]Sticky.
[31:08.83]Yes.
[31:11.57]You guys.
[31:22.36]So then we have swimmer, three suckers, a jumper, and a stomper.
[31:30.10]I think that's good.
[31:34.52]There we go.
[31:34.84]Dude, this is the dream blunt rotation.
[31:39.81]No, it's not.
[31:43.47]It's not.
[31:47.73]I wonder if I can break this.
[31:50.45]Yes, it is.
[31:52.17]Alright, you're telling me that these five trebums are your dream blunt rotation?
[31:59.01]The one, two, three, four, wait, these six trebums.
[32:08.38]Yes.
[32:10.68]Oh, okay, we need a... Of course it is.
[32:18.40]You don't want anybody else throughout all of history, all, any character, any celebrity, any, like, I don't know.
[32:26.01]You know, Abraham Lincoln's not in there.
[32:33.89]It's these five, it's five Trevums and Abraham Lincoln.
[32:40.23]Dream fun rotation.
[32:41.91]Alright, what am I supposed to be doing?
[32:51.96]Alright, let's drop now.
[32:55.66]Interesting.
[32:59.02]Ooh.
[33:02.19]What is that?
[33:04.89]What'd it do?
[33:08.53]What'd it do?
[33:11.89]Secret.
[33:13.42]Ooh, what's that?
[33:16.86]Another power.
[33:19.64]Hmm.
[33:20.06]Hmm.
[33:23.41]I don't know who should eat this.
[33:24.61]Probably this one, right?
[33:26.56]This guy, this one doesn't have a body.
[33:32.60]Save scum?
[33:33.10]I can't.
[33:35.40]Alright, new guy, go ahead.
[33:36.46]Uh-oh.
[33:43.81]The mixer mutation allows the Trebim to combine specific ingredients to create offensive projectiles.
[33:49.47]Finally.
[33:50.33]That can be launched at enemies.
[33:54.17]Finally, a gun.
[34:12.32]This new power might be necessary for their survival.
[34:15.90]Thank God.
[34:16.32]Okay, so this is now a gun?
[34:17.18]But they would have to make sure to use it carefully, so they would never become as cruel as the servants of the Cylinders.
[34:24.76]Does this hurt?
[34:26.70]I- What the fuck?
[34:27.92]It's a grenade!
[34:29.38]Wha- OH!
[34:30.64]You alright?
[34:31.53]You- Get out of- Get out of the way!
[34:33.35]What- I don't know what I just did.
[34:34.19]I don't know what I did.
[34:34.79]The chain reaction just- The chain reaction just went off.
[34:39.71]I'm sorry, I'm testing.
[34:41.71]I'm testing it.
[34:49.40]Just mix everything.
[34:52.56]Wait.
[34:53.66]Is this the slot that... No.
[34:59.46]Okay.
[35:01.46]I think this cannot be used.
[35:06.93]It can't.
[35:07.27]Alright.
[35:10.07]Might play the Resident Evil 4 remake.
[35:11.39]100% guaranteed.
[35:15.39]100% guaranteed, yes.
[35:21.43]Can I break this?
[35:22.55]Maybe I can break it with my new grenade.
[35:24.07]Everybody get out of the way.
[35:29.17]Get out of the way.
[35:29.59]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[35:38.34]Can I not shatter this?
[35:40.99]Well, let's get the info.
[35:43.87]Yes, the map.
[35:44.65]Thank God.
[35:51.73]So, this little guy has to survive under any means necessary.
[35:59.96]Without this, we have no offense.
[36:03.50]So, I have to control this character.
[36:08.76]Very cool.
[36:10.16]I think that's it.
[36:16.92]Um, hold on now.
[36:21.35]Who doesn't have a body?
[36:22.81]You don't.
[36:24.61]Fire doesn't.
[36:25.85]You don't have a body.
[36:28.01]You do now.
[36:42.85]Nice.
[36:44.18]Alright, this guy is now total offense.
[36:53.94]These are the floating things, right?
[36:55.52]I feel like I should hang on to maybe one or two of these.
[36:58.56]I wish I could store them somewhere.
[37:00.51]I wish I had a chest.
[37:01.09]Alright, in the meantime, I have projectiles on you.
[37:11.35]Okay, I'm ready.
[37:12.67]I'm ready to shoot a grenade if I need to.
[37:19.07]Gunu is the chest.
[37:20.81]Yeah, but I mean, not like two extra, three extra slots.
[37:24.90]I mean, you know what I mean?
[37:32.62]You can put them on your stored, your teammate.
[37:34.46]He's turning it into water.
[37:43.57]Wait, hold on.
[37:44.43]How come the, why are they over here?
[37:48.25]Why are they split up like this?
[37:49.15]Kind of weird.
[37:59.47]There's a hole back in the wall.
[38:02.71]Was there?
[38:12.28]Gunu is looking svelte today.
[38:15.72]What is svelte?
[38:23.63]Oh, what's up?
[38:25.75]How you doing?
[38:27.01]Um.
[38:29.23]Ah!
[38:34.94]Shoot him!
[38:35.98]Shoot him!
[38:36.84]What?
[38:37.88]What?
[38:38.26]I was shooting.
[38:39.18]What?
[38:40.02]Excuse me?
[38:44.75]I'm literally holding right trigger and he sprayed water at him.
[39:00.42]Yeah, fuck you.
[39:02.87]What's that?
[39:05.19]A new thing?
[39:06.35]Somebody eat it.
[39:07.65]You eat this.
[39:08.29]I don't know what it does, but you eat it.
[39:17.83]Uh-oh.
[39:20.94]Oh.
[39:22.24]Well, that's not good.
[39:25.28]Um... Sorry.
[39:32.31]Okay, well, we're gonna just keep moving.
[39:39.04]I need some ingredients.
[39:45.28]Where, okay, where am I going from here?
[39:47.32]Straight up?
[39:50.28]There's a hole on the left.
[39:51.39]I'm gonna go to the hole.
[40:03.47]Yeah, like over here.
[40:04.37]I don't want to miss all these things.
[40:10.44]There's a lot of good stuff in here.
[40:19.32]This way.
[40:19.66]Okay, this little village area.
[40:23.90]Alright, make some grenades.
[40:32.63]I gotta have a good stockpile of these.
[40:34.15]That's a different grenade.
[40:36.11]That's different.
[40:38.21]I have no idea what that does, but all I care about is does it hurt.
[40:41.19]I don't care about anything else.
[40:45.35]Shit, this is a poison hole.
[40:48.38]A bunch of them still have the poison resist.
[40:53.28]Does that matter?
[40:54.24]What if one of them goes down and doesn't have poison resist?
[41:01.49]Is it OK?
[41:03.61]Find out.
[41:04.22]OK.
[41:14.96]Yep, nice.
[41:26.23]Where am I going?
[41:28.39]Down here, because this one is free.
[41:32.95]You okay?
[41:35.37]I have it.
[41:35.97]I can get him.
[41:36.77]Hold on, what's up here?
[41:41.36]Dude, what is this?

[41:57.83]SICK!
[42:05.69]How many do I have?
[42:06.19]Seven?
[42:12.11]I wonder if I can break these.
[42:15.21]No.
[42:16.48]They made it a point that these were here.
[42:21.56]Why were these incubating?
[42:27.34]Maybe for ammo?
[42:33.66]I... That's a good idea.
[42:35.86]Let's find out.
[42:37.26]So if I give you these... Does that do anything?
[42:47.73]Cluster Bomb?
[42:48.85]Big Cluster Bomb.
[42:51.18]I don't think I can mix it with anything yet.
[43:02.36]Okay, cool.
[43:04.50]It should be seven.
[43:09.20]I don't... That's poison stuff?
[43:10.33]Well, then that's glow-in-the-dark.
[43:11.33]Wait.
[43:11.99]Maybe somebody should be glow-in-the-dark.
[43:18.97]I'm gonna take it for now.
[43:24.17]Chest.

[47:49.18]There's so many decisions.
[47:50.34]It's too cool.
[47:53.66]Egg.
[47:53.76]What was that?
[48:02.45]Can I hatch it from here?
[48:06.09]Yup.
[48:09.86]We're gonna have eight.
[48:14.94]Alright, come on.

[48:33.78]Um... That's not good.
[48:47.75]Alright, I need to mark where that is.
[48:48.88]I think you're just gonna die.
[48:51.30]Sacrifice Gunu?
[48:52.42]No.
[48:53.94]Nobody can be sacrificed.
[48:54.82]They're all...
[49:03.36]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[49:04.16]There's nothing I can do about this.
[49:12.83]I'm not sacrificing anybody.
[49:14.55]Who has the stakes?
[49:15.31]You do.
[49:20.31]I'm not sacrificing anybody.
[49:21.43]I'm sorry.
[49:25.22]There's a storage place.
[49:28.53]Okay, I gotta remember where this is.
[49:30.27]It's right on the kind of corner here.
[49:33.19]And I gotta go over here.
[49:34.71]I'll be back.
[49:43.78]I can store somebody.
[49:46.88]I'll be back.
[49:53.87]Alright, who's getting uploaded?
[50:01.64]Yeah, but do I want us to?
[50:02.66]I mean, I don't know who to upload.
[50:06.82]I guess you could get uploaded.
[50:09.92]You're the swimmer.
[50:10.95]Alright, Woogwool, you're getting uploaded.
[50:12.27]Okay.
[50:23.46]Oh no, sad.
[50:24.54]We can bring them back.
[50:31.94]Okay, wood wall has been uploaded.
[50:33.14]How much does it cost to bring somebody back?
[50:36.80]Too expensive.
[50:38.62]Too expensive.
[50:42.92]Alright, let's go get the other one.
[50:52.13]Somebody have a bomb?
[50:56.05]Don't even think about it.
[50:56.69]Just move, just move, just move.
[50:58.15]It's not worth it.
[51:03.88]Alright.
[51:04.82]Cool hair, friend.
[51:09.51]Aha!

[51:13.07]Alright, Groppo.
[51:14.15]Come with us.
[51:19.93]What the fuck?
[51:23.14]Okay, I think there's one more thing over here.
[51:26.46]What is it?
[51:30.50]You see this?
[51:31.40]Where is this going?
[51:33.69]Oh, yeah.
[51:34.03]Alright.
[51:34.97]It's time to move.
[51:36.41]You guys ready to go?
[51:37.49]Let's eat first.
[51:42.38]You got the steaks.
[51:43.26]Yeah.
[51:44.92]Eat all these steaks.
[51:46.88]Wait, what?
[51:48.46]You have the steak.
[51:54.11]We're good on food.
[51:55.09]Oh, yeah.
[51:55.35]You got all the steaks.
[51:59.61]Alright.
[51:59.85]Continue.
[52:00.79]Continue.
[52:07.01]I'm thinking of going.
[52:08.06]I'm going to just bang around here.
[52:09.92]Yeah, alright, let's go.
[52:21.29]Change his name.
[52:23.07]I don't think I can robo robo.
[52:30.88]Alright, fill up that meter.
[52:33.26]I'm very interested.
[52:34.04]Alright, this is a pretty good party.

[52:48.71]This is not too far.
[52:53.27]Oh.

[53:06.63]never mind I don't know
[53:35.14]OK.
[53:36.52]Everybody safe?
[53:37.78]Yes.
[53:43.90]What was that?
[53:44.74]Did you see that?
[53:48.28]Like a giant tail.
[53:49.66]That was actually kind of terrifying.
[53:52.64]Alright, we got something over here.
[53:58.03]Finally, it's warm.
[53:58.77]Yeah, thank God.
[54:02.75]Another friend.
[54:05.00]Possible.
[54:08.12]God.
[54:08.44]Come on strangely named evil giant was back.
[54:19.05]What was he hunting for?
[54:22.01]What monstrosities would he summon this time?
[54:25.63]Do you want?
[54:39.87]What was that for?
[54:48.57]That's it?
[54:53.29]What is that thing?
[55:02.84]No, we're good.
[55:09.18]The Trebom needed to protect themselves against the creature's terrible light.
[55:13.24]Oh, shit.
[55:14.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[55:15.94]Uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
[55:18.54]Oh, no, it's taking powers away.
[55:20.52]It's taking our powers away.
[55:28.35]It's taking powers away.
[55:39.83]What the fuck is this?
[55:42.91]Wait.
[55:43.65]No.
[55:44.05]What?
[55:44.73]What's going on?
[55:47.87]This... Oh.
[55:49.59]Hold on.
[55:50.07]Go back.
[55:54.45]What am I doing?
[55:55.93]I'm trying to get away from the light.
[56:02.25]It just follows you around.
[56:04.80]Can we stand a...
[56:07.99]I don't... I think this is scripted.
[56:12.25]Because there's nowhere to go.
[56:13.07]I think we're, like, supposed to have this happen.
[56:18.35]For, like, now.
[56:21.07]I can't outrun it.
[56:21.73]Look.
[56:23.01]I literally can't outrun it.
[56:27.19]Uh... What would I need to do?
[56:36.61]I don't understand.
[56:37.23]What does it want me to do?
[56:45.60]Sticky feet?
[56:52.02]Where's the thing?
[56:59.04]Something nearby may help.
[57:00.20]Yeah, I mean that's pretty vague though.
[57:02.08]I don't know if it wants me to like attack somebody or get one of these monsters to move around or just run in the temple or I don't know.
[57:18.87]The strangely named evil giant was back.
[57:23.12]What was he hunting for?
[57:26.06]Fuck you, buddy.
[57:27.70]Alright, get in.
[57:28.50]It's definitely something in here.
[57:33.22]Or maybe not.
[57:57.22]The Tremum found themselves gathering around a mysterious projection.
[58:02.62]They seemed to think it was an Elder.
[58:05.78]This is a recording pool, the projection said.
[58:10.48]I left this message here to help you.
[58:15.08]I have discovered the recipe to permanently imbue my body with the power of this mutation and protect it from the evil light of our enemies.
[58:26.18]Okay.
[58:26.46]Mutation tree?
[58:58.77]This just... Hold on.
[59:02.60]Filter?
[59:03.98]Is this like a permanent upgrade system?
[59:13.35]Okay.
[59:13.95]So track this.
[59:16.43]So this is a toxic filter.
[59:19.93]Oh, you just got Elden Ringed.
[59:24.81]Okay.
[59:26.48]So...
[59:30.46]There's another egg here.
[59:32.94]Nope.
[59:33.46]It's just this person's ass.
[59:36.68]Never mind.
[59:40.48]Hmm.
[59:41.38]I don't think I'm going to have enough for anything.
[60:11.77]I think I'm gonna do health.
[60:12.51]I feel like I want it.
[60:17.15]How come you're referring to everything as a person?
[60:18.72]I don't know.
[60:21.62]Just a little like a little person.
[60:23.50]I don't know a little alien, a little creature.
[60:27.51]I don't know.
[60:29.87]It's definitely not a person.
[60:32.14]It's a creature of some sort of intelligence.
[60:37.84]I don't know.
[60:38.74]They are people.
[60:39.38]Yeah, whatever.
[60:39.96]Okay.
[60:41.93]What do you guys think?
[60:49.41]Health?
[60:50.71]Health is for... Why do I just hold?
[60:53.66]What do you guys think?
[60:58.69]As the Trebom prepared to leave the cave, the apparition spoke one final time.
[61:06.35]If you are lost and wandering helplessly across the land, look to the sky and seek a celestial serpent.
[61:14.77]Yeah, we did that already, and they were mean.
[61:15.95]You will know them by their many tails, which hang down from the clouds as the serpents contemplate the matters of the heavens.
[61:24.66]These serpents guard the way to the wisest of our kind who can guide you to salvation.
[61:31.34]We came across one and it was me.
[61:32.44]I thought of asking the apparition to join them.
[61:35.26]But before they could, it had faded away.
[61:39.41]Like the voice in their minds, it was only a memory.
[61:46.99]Fire.
[61:49.53]I'm doing health.
[62:03.59]Okay, so that's very interesting, because now I have this mutation tree.
[62:12.85]Three of those plus one egg means I can just use it.
[62:16.65]Okay, is there anything I can do to prevent being... Leaping legs, webbed feet.
[62:23.46]Okay, there's a bunch of other stuff I haven't found yet.
[62:30.04]There's a lot of stuff I haven't found.
[62:34.79]Alright, so the play is I gotta get out of here, and I have to go very fast just away from this area.
[62:52.29]Yeah, it should be saved in here.
[62:54.45]Alright, I'm getting all my friends ready to move.
[62:57.89]We gotta go very fast.
[63:06.43]right when we get out we're gonna move do you yawn silently and make dad noises I'm curious um probably are you talking about like the ingredients required for the impervious mutation were all here
[63:29.44]Oh my god.
[63:30.16]Okay, we get... Get out of the way of this.
[63:32.88]Because it's gonna take away our powers.
[63:35.32]Ah.
[64:02.29]So we have to find shrines.
[64:08.37]This area is enclosed by poisonous gas that can't be filtered by the filter trunk mutation.
[64:13.23]However, the nearby servant will not allow you to keep your mutations.
[64:17.97]Find the ingredients requested in the filter trunk node in the mutation tree and activate them there.
[64:22.57]Okay.
[64:25.59]It can.
[64:34.55]So I think it's... I think if I lose mutation... Yeah, I think it's just gonna happen.
[64:40.22]Right.
[64:41.66]Yeah, it's okay.
[64:43.40]It's alright.
[64:43.82]This has happened before.
[64:44.54]Yeah, there's no... There's no hiding, really.
[64:55.32]We just have to kind of do it again.
[64:58.93]How do I get you to get off of there?
[65:16.76]Alright, now get up.
[65:22.66]You know, just take it.
[65:24.46]Just get one.
[65:25.04]I got one.
[65:25.74]I got one.
[65:27.16]Alright, let's get out of here.
[65:28.86]Let's get out of here.
[65:35.67]What do I do?
[65:36.09]I have to break it.
[65:37.81]There's one.
[65:41.83]Now I just need three of these things.
[65:44.92]the trebum had stolen the occyford egg but cracking its thick shell was proving difficult I already got it perhaps the answer lay in the mighty jaws of the fearsome omnigrom I just broke it man what are you going about okay so now I can mix items
[66:10.98]So now they permanently have a filter trunk.
[66:14.48]Mutate.
[66:16.06]Permanently.
[66:16.48]Okay.
[66:24.01]Did that work?
[66:33.47]Is it for everybody?
[66:36.86]That's like a thicker one too.
[66:38.54]Look at that.
[66:40.32]Is it for everybody?
[66:43.71]It is for everybody.
[66:45.55]Oh, that's so awesome.
[66:46.65]Thank God.
[66:48.53]Oh my God, that's so much better.
[66:51.88]Perfect.
[66:52.78]Hell yeah.
[66:53.10]So then what is this?
[67:03.25]What is this saying?
[67:08.19]Is there a person here?
[67:13.70]What the hell?
[67:16.92]It's a puzzle.
[67:20.32]Any more of those?
[67:25.64]Yep.
[67:32.82]This is a Lego Star Wars ass puzzle.
[67:37.49]It kind of is.
[67:44.92]Where's that thing that I'm moving?
[67:46.38]Is it down here somewhere?
[67:51.10]Looks like it's down here somewhere.
[68:01.07]Can I just jump out of here?
[68:02.09]I don't know what's the significance of doing this.
[68:03.63]It's just making stairs.
[68:15.53]All I'm going to stream for, I don't know.
[68:17.23]A lot longer than than right now.
[68:21.13]I don't know.
[68:36.96]Yeah, I don't.
[68:37.72]What's the significance of this?
[68:41.26]This is not like a big deal.
[68:44.16]I have a jumper, I can jump out of this if I wanted to.
[68:58.47]You don't have a jumper?
[68:59.17]Uh, Gunu has the jumper legs.
[69:05.71]Where is Gunu?
[69:15.49]Oh, that's right.
[69:16.33]Everything.
[69:16.97]I was like, where is it?
[69:18.59]Right.
[69:19.35]It's all the powers got removed.
[69:20.82]Okay.
[69:21.22]I was like, what happened?
[69:25.36]So this is not right.
[69:26.84]Where's my, where's my, where's my big friend?
[69:29.32]Alright.
[69:32.35]Cylinder's going to move.
[69:33.07]I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[69:36.29]Didn't.
[69:37.63]Alright.
[69:37.99]Are we good?
[69:40.19]I got to go straight and go.
[69:45.67]I do need water, but it's OK.
[70:05.64]The song reminds me of something that would be played in Rugrats.
[70:12.47]This is a Rugrats theme.
[70:19.09]That like... You've never seen the Rugrats?
[70:38.71]It's an old cartoon.
[70:51.33]Back in the cold.
[71:05.64]Oh OK, hold on.
[71:09.46]Alright.
[71:12.46]There's nothing here technically.
[71:15.63]So just explore a little bit.
[71:18.31]Don't get killed.
[71:23.93]Save it.
[71:31.80]And water.
[71:36.31]Which Rugrat would you be?
[71:39.17]I think I'll be Abby Grandpa.
[71:51.12]Oh, morning, Sprout.
[71:52.62]How you doing morning, Sprout?
[71:54.60]Yeah.
[72:06.95]No, you're stew.
[72:08.49]No, I am not stew pickles.
[72:13.61]Oh, we need jackets.
[72:20.57]Are there any jacket plants anywhere over here?
[72:22.09]There we go, right here.
[72:25.66]I'm not stew pickles, no.
[72:27.48]I refuse to listen to that.
[72:40.95]Aha!
[72:43.60]It is warm again.
[72:55.02]Average Stu reaction.
[73:01.12]Wait, so, hold on.
[73:02.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:02.72]Is Stu... Is Stu the one that talks like this?
[73:06.58]Who's the one that talks like this?
[73:08.84]Who's the one that... Who's the Brian Griffin?
[73:11.29]What's his name?
[73:20.73]Is that Stu?
[73:21.05]Stu?
[73:27.22]Okay, the second one.
[73:29.22]What was Stu's brother's name?
[73:31.48]Both the glasses.
[73:40.69]Drew... Okay, yeah.
[73:42.05]Alright, for a second I thought you were talking about I was Drew Pickles.
[73:44.09]And I was like, bro, I am not Drew Pickles.
[73:47.10]Nah, I can see Stu.
[73:48.66]I can see him.
[73:49.02]That makes sense to me.
[73:49.60]Alright, we're going for that hole over there.
[73:58.27]Remember, why are you making chocolate pudding?
[74:03.82]I actually probably would do that.
[74:10.56]That actually sounds like pretty pretty good idea right now, actually.
[74:20.20]This is moving kind of fast.
[74:25.25]Oh, this one's moving much faster than the other one did.
[74:37.00]I made mac and cheese before at like 2 a.m.
[74:39.16]Yeah.
[74:40.44]But that was a completely different scenario.
[74:42.24]Maybe one day I'll explain that scenario.
[74:50.69]Yeah, alright, so... Yeah, this is a topic for another day.
[75:02.16]Okay, so I'll bring the topic up.
[75:07.92]So... I was... I may have been... I may have had some marijuana.
[75:14.27]This is a couple weeks ago.
[75:16.91]And I posed the question to Holly.
[75:20.19]And this was an incredibly deep conversation.
[75:24.19]I asked... We're talking about, like, food.
[75:26.19]And I was sitting there going... Who made the first sauce?
[75:32.92]Who made the first sauce?
[75:36.42]Because at some point...
[75:39.03]You know, food was for energy.
[75:41.03]Food was to survive.
[75:43.51]Who the fuck decided to make the first sauce?
[75:47.71]And I wrote down on a whiteboard, a shitload of information.
[75:54.19]Cause it was, the questions were, okay, if you're a hunter gatherer, you don't, you can't make a sauce.
[76:00.81]When did pickiness, when did preference become a thing?
[76:04.09]Was it a surplus of food?
[76:07.69]Who made the first sauce?
[76:09.29]Because why would you make a sauce?
[76:11.19]Why would you make a sauce?
[76:12.83]There's no reason for it.
[76:16.41]Oh, today we've got onions and meat.
[76:19.80]I'm going to make an au jus.
[76:21.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[76:21.86]You eat because food was scarce.
[76:24.76]Why would you make a sauce?
[76:29.04]You know what I mean?
[76:30.06]Why would you make a sauce?
[76:32.10]Until preference became a thing, right?
[76:41.12]Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the ancient Romans.
[76:48.98]Okay.
[76:51.64]So, but why?
[76:53.40]If food was, from caveman times to hunter-gatherers, food was, you eat food, eat the food.
[77:00.37]There's no like, oh, give me like four or five hours to make a fucking sauce.
[77:04.13]No, eat that fucking meat that we just got.
[77:06.53]There's four onions out back.
[77:11.99]Yeah, when did- it was- it's taste.
[77:14.02]So when did taste become a thing that you could care about?
[77:17.96]Romans?
[77:30.79]It was rich people.
[77:42.03]Yeah.
[77:42.33]Once abundant.
[77:43.13]Yeah.
[77:43.43]Abundance.
[77:48.17]Hold on a second.
[77:48.97]This is important.
[77:50.99]Okay.
[78:02.03]Okay.
[78:02.47]So what I'm about to present to you, I'm going to present to you something.
[78:10.04]is the whiteboard that I wrote on with the help from Holly.
[78:20.10]And we're going to go over it just very quickly.
[78:23.08]Very quickly.
[78:27.44]I had to write this down because in my brain, I'm like, this is kind of wild to think about.
[78:31.10]Like, why would you make a sauce?
[78:32.52]Like, why?
[78:33.00]Who would do that?
[78:34.54]Abundance.
[78:35.70]Joy.
[78:36.22]Is it happiness?
[78:37.74]Hold on.
[78:38.10]I'll just show it for a minute.
[78:53.51]Where'd it go?
[78:59.67]Hold on.
[79:09.55]Okay.
[79:12.49]What the hell?
[79:16.11]Why can I not save this as an image?
[79:18.41]Hold on.
[79:23.49]I'm going to save it as there it is.
[79:37.42]What the fuck?
[79:41.02]It's a JPEG on my desktop.
[79:43.19]Why is it not showing up on my desktop now?
[79:45.83]I don't understand computers.
[79:47.15]That doesn't make any sense.
[79:48.71]Save to desktop this image.
[79:50.81]And it's not there.
[79:52.89]I literally just did it three times.
[79:54.21]Okay, there it is.
[80:03.88]Alright, let's go over this really, really quick.
[80:21.19]Okay.
[80:29.09]Alright.
[80:30.33]So, let's go over this.
[80:32.64]Really, really fast.
[80:33.88]I don't want to spend too much time on this.
[80:37.42]Who made the first sauce?
[80:39.76]was a caveman?
[80:40.58]No.
[80:41.02]Survival only.
[80:41.82]No time for sauce.
[80:42.60]Food was hard to get.
[80:43.94]Hunter-gatherers.
[80:44.72]People.
[80:45.08]Why make sauce?
[80:46.96]People were nomadic.
[80:48.88]What was the first sauce?
[80:51.28]When was the concept of taste?
[80:53.40]When something isn't just feel?
[80:55.60]What?
[80:56.88]I need this to do.
[80:58.44]Wait, what does this say?
[81:01.02]I need this to taste the way that I want.
[81:03.82]No such thing as picky.
[81:05.36]When did humans allow picky?
[81:07.20]Preferences.
[81:07.84]Smells.
[81:08.72]No matter what, there's no reason to make a sauce.
[81:13.11]There is no reason.
[81:15.19]There just kind of isn't.
[81:18.33]The answer was watch Ratatouille.
[81:21.99]The concept of being picky, luxury, joy, smells.
[81:25.95]Holly told me to watch Ratatouille.
[81:28.50]And I told her,
[81:30.26]I don't think I can handle Ratatouille right now.
[81:33.26]While this whole conversation was happening, I was going from the whiteboard, I was making mac and cheese on the stove at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[81:42.63]I remember just going, slop, like, slop.
[81:46.35]She's like, you should just watch Ratatouille, it's kind of that concept, that same concept.
[81:50.33]I don't think I can handle Ratatouille right now.
[81:54.87]Like, it was, I was like too high for Ratatouille?
[81:58.51]What does that even mean?
[82:07.33]But I don't know how to think about it.
[82:08.51]Like, who made the first sauce?
[82:15.93]Stop saying it like that.
[82:19.85]Like what?
[82:27.53]Cut his mic.
[82:30.37]Ratatouille.
[82:31.51]Ratatouille.
[82:33.07]Ratatouille.
[82:36.44]Well, isn't it about a rat?
[82:38.44]Ratatouille.
[82:39.30]It's not Ratatouille?
[82:43.85]Okay, I gotta go this way.
[82:49.55]Hold on.
[82:51.67]Get rid of that.
[82:53.73]Oh, by the way, um, Holly in the middle of that took over and was writing for me because I went mid-sentence and said, hey, can you do this instead?
[83:02.26]She's like, uh, sure, I guess.
[83:06.14]That's why, like, the handwriting changes, like, halfway through.
[83:08.52]Yeah, but everything that we can talk about, the concept of abundance, or being picky, or preference, or taste, or smells, or just happy, it tastes good.
[83:23.79]That concept, almost, like, why?
[83:27.07]Who decided to, like, make the first one?
[83:30.92]Did you just have too much fucking corn, and you just squished it?
[83:36.76]It's an interesting concept.
[83:39.58]It's not hard.
[83:40.50]No, it isn't hard.
[83:41.44]But somebody had to make that call.
[83:45.60]Am I going the right way?
[83:46.72]Yeah.
[83:49.64]Wait.
[83:56.15]Sure, dude.
[83:57.46]Yeah, somebody had to make that call.
[83:58.96]Somebody had to be like, you know what?
[83:59.98]We have a lot of onions.
[84:01.06]I'm going to just ruin them all.
[84:02.54]What are you talking about?
[84:03.60]Don't do that.
[84:04.02]You're going to mash up like ten of them?
[84:06.46]Yeah.
[84:07.40]We need those to eat.
[84:08.48]Yeah, but I want to make a sauce.
[84:10.75]No, you're not going to.
[84:11.59]What is that?
[84:11.95]What are you talking about?
[84:13.45]Don't touch those fucking onions.
[84:16.43]That's for the next six months.
[84:22.61]I missed a fucking thing.
[84:25.04]It's alright.
[84:32.84]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[84:35.40]What happened?
[84:43.32]It was agriculture.
[84:48.89]Okay, so something went wrong there.
[84:53.21]I probably need heat resistance.
[84:56.63]From what?
[84:57.70]Hold on.
[84:59.66]I kind of was walking back.
[85:00.54]I gotta go back this way.
[85:08.31]First sauce had to have been mayonnaise.
[85:09.75]Think about it.
[85:10.97]I don't think that's accurate.
[85:21.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[85:22.41]Somebody has an answer.
[85:23.57]Hold on.
[85:27.74]Lack of refrigeration in the early days of cooking meat, poultry, fish, seafood didn't last long.
[85:32.59]Sauces and gravies were used to make the flavor of tainted foods.
[85:36.71]So 200 AD, the Romans used sauces to disguise the taste of the food, possibly to conceal doubtful freshness.
[85:48.56]Wow, really?
[85:50.82]Somebody said that can't be right.
[85:51.93]Is that wrong?
[85:52.79]What do you mean wrong?
[85:54.77]That's not real.
[85:55.69]Is that why it's been getting deleted by the mods?
[86:06.21]Is that made up lore?
[86:07.37]Alright, let me go back to paying attention to the game for a minute.
[86:12.79]Who made the first sauce?
[86:13.95]Because every time you think about like who it was, you have to kind of go like, well, why?
[86:18.70]You hunted, you ate, you planted.
[86:21.44]There's no reason to make one.
[86:29.31]This, there was this hole.
[86:34.43]It was me.
[86:41.51]Was I already back here?
[86:43.07]I got really confused after showing my fucking like whiteboard rant.
[86:49.03]I don't think I went down here.
[86:49.81]First off, this was invented by Ronald McDonald.
[86:51.27]It was ketchup.
[87:19.67]This is a new creature.
[87:28.69]You know what?
[87:29.43]I'll tell you though.
[87:30.79]Let's be fucking careful.
[87:32.87]Write shit down.
[87:34.31]Make sure you're documenting things.
[87:36.57]We need to make sure we document history because in a thousand years, somebody might fucking think that.
[87:43.23]Do you understand this?
[87:44.77]There might be a point eventually
[87:48.55]thousand two thousand years in the future where somebody's just like oh who made the first sauce oh well of course it was Ronald McDonald this was god back in the uh 2000 ad we got to be careful with how we documenting history and make sure we keep it accurate we got to make sure it's correct the the water can get really really muddy if we're not careful this is a different kind of fish
[88:20.51]Should I try it?
[88:20.95]I'm gonna try it.
[88:28.82]Electro skin?
[88:33.00]Allows a Trevon to create electrical discharges which can revive an ally.
[88:40.87]Um...
[88:44.15]freezing, everybody's freezing, get out of the water, get out of the water, can I go in here, I'm electrified, no, I'm not, okay, get out of the water, get out of the water, get out of the water,
[89:15.65]Get out of the fucking water.
[89:18.49]Wait, are they cold?
[89:19.73]I don't understand what's going on right now.
[89:20.97]Didn't I get one of the things?
[89:24.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:25.34]I'm so confused.
[89:27.02]I ate one of the fuzzy things and it went on everybody.
[89:31.71]Right?
[89:32.35]That was like five minutes ago.
[89:42.89]You lost it when you got Electro.
[89:44.97]What?
[89:46.86]Hold on a second.
[89:47.96]Wait a minute.
[89:48.58]Wait a minute.
[89:49.22]Wait a minute.
[89:57.51]They didn't all have it.
[90:07.58]No, this is not right.
[90:11.38]Is it the cold water?
[90:12.88]Or whatever it is, I fucking don't know.
[90:15.18]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[90:16.04]I only need one to have it, yeah.
[90:20.50]It's the water, okay.
[90:24.34]It's the water.
[90:26.24]I was gonna say, it doesn't make any sense.
[90:27.52]I don't think it's the water.
[90:34.69]I'm just gonna get out of here.
[90:38.15]You replaced the one that actually had it.
[90:40.86]Well, let me get the fuck out of here.
[90:50.28]Shit.
[91:07.42]Sorry buddy, we gotta go.
[91:23.69]Oh my god, dude, like the hit, the collision detection on some of these fucking rocks, I swear to god.
[91:47.01]This is like the hardest thing I've had to do so far in the whole game.
[91:59.57]Okay, so somebody eat a fuzzy then.
[92:05.00]What the fuck happened here?
[92:09.20]Everyone's still dying from the cold.
[92:13.45]Alright, so that's, I guess that's my fault for, I thought that if somebody ate one, that it just went on everybody.
[92:20.43]And it did go on everybody, but it comes off of everybody if the one person doesn't have it on.
[92:28.79]I, okay, what the fuck?
[92:30.37]How am I supposed, what?
[92:37.18]I thought they all had it, so this guy didn't have it, so they all don't have it.
[92:43.05]Fucking horse shit.
[92:50.18]No, it's fine.
[92:50.76]I'm keeping this one.
[92:53.42]This guy has the electric skin.
[92:57.80]Well, we need to heal now.
[93:10.30]Only six?
[93:11.81]Oh...
[93:13.52]It would have said somebody died.
[93:14.48]Didn't say anybody died.
[93:19.56]Oh my goodness.
[93:23.64]Okay.
[93:24.34]Okay.
[93:24.70]Okay.
[93:25.08]Alright.
[93:25.44]Alright.
[93:25.68]Alright.
[93:25.96]Alright.
[93:26.36]Alright.
[93:26.82]Stop.
[93:35.25]What?
[93:37.09]What just hap- why did he roll backwards?
[93:40.07]Why did he- he rolled backwards?
[93:43.24]I am fucking confused as you could ever be right now.
[93:46.87]He's dead.
[94:02.06]Come on, dude!
[94:03.54]Get out of the way!
[94:05.28]You piece of shit!
[94:17.06]No, it's over.
[94:17.54]We're actually just fucked.
[94:32.11]I don't even know who... Who even died?
[94:39.75]Reload from... 20 minutes ago?
[94:41.94]No.
[94:47.74]Look, the game is designed for... You're not... Everybody doesn't get to stay... Now what the fuck is happening?
[95:01.33]Okay.
[95:04.30]You spent 20 minutes talking about sauce.
[95:05.82]It's fine.
[95:06.18]What are you... Why are you looking at this?
[95:16.08]Is that true?
[95:17.68]True?
[95:17.98]I mean, I did... Alright, I did spend 20 minutes talking about sauce.
[95:29.79]We're good.
[95:35.42]Oh yeah, this is right here.
[95:36.22]We're good.
[95:55.02]Alright, so we're fuzzy.
[95:57.18]Okay.
[95:57.88]So, same deal.
[95:58.76]I wish I could just take one person.
[96:01.07]Having to take everybody is just so dangerous.
[96:03.75]Everybody's going to die.
[96:05.23]I want to get that power, though.
[96:10.85]So, I'm just going in and going out.
[96:29.74]Gonna make it very easy.
[96:31.04]Very quick.
[96:31.46]I'm gonna make it simple.
[96:40.03]I'm not gonna put it on this one.
[96:40.99]I won't.
[96:43.41]Okay.
[96:44.13]Pin that up.
[96:45.77]Get this shit out of here.
[96:47.25]No!
[96:47.67]Don't!
[96:49.17]I don't wanna... Sorry.
[96:56.20]I don't like the buttons.
[96:57.28]I should just change them.
[96:58.42]They're just so fucked up.
[96:59.40]I don't know.
[97:09.71]Please raise your hand in the chat if B is always cancel.
[97:12.99]Or always like get back.
[97:14.79]Always.
[97:15.87]No matter what.
[97:17.98]Or run.
[97:18.72]It's sprint.
[97:19.74]Or back.
[97:22.10]To me B is never use item.
[97:24.00]It's back out of menu.
[97:32.68]Give this to you.
[97:39.22]Okay, let's go.
[97:44.30]Get out.
[97:51.91]It says it.
[97:53.61]It doesn't matter if it says it.
[97:54.97]It's baked into 30 years of me playing video games.
[98:02.30]just change the menu.
[98:06.97]Okay, let's get up.
[98:08.03]I can't save that one.
[98:22.26]Dude, don't do that shit again.
[98:24.24]Alright, everything is back.
[98:27.69]Crisis averted.
[98:28.33]We talked about the sauce.
[98:29.25]Pretty cool.
[98:29.75]Let's go.
[98:31.91]We have to find a way over here.
[98:36.81]I do want somebody to eat this though, but not right now.
[98:40.33]In fact, get rid of this.
[98:42.12]I don't want this fucking thing.
[98:45.12]I want to control... Who's the one that has... No, you're the best one to be controlling right now.
[98:53.40]Alright, let's go.
[98:56.35]Alright, I'm going to get electrocuted.
[99:02.30]Gotta go underneath.
[99:11.21]Get those stakes.
[99:16.36]Stay away from that.
[99:17.54]Alright, can I go under here?
[99:19.44]Yep, because the temple's under here.
[99:30.44]Alright, I got screwed last time.
[99:32.48]Everybody in.
[99:41.30]Let's go.
[99:47.07]Alright, cool.
[99:47.69]We made it.
[99:57.17]So what was in here that I wanted to look at?
[100:04.50]How do you still have all of your powers?
[100:06.20]Holy shit.
[100:10.18]This dude is still stacked.
[100:11.04]Alright, there's a balloon.
[100:13.49]Let me check the other areas, though.
[100:18.19]Okay.
[100:27.37]You... I'll give this to a few people.
[100:33.00]Not everybody needs it.
[100:40.13]OK.
[100:40.21]You go Gino.
[100:42.15]Now Gino is the healer.
[100:48.42]It'll be.
[100:52.06]The laundry detergent here.
[101:04.33]You know what?
[101:06.75]You take one of these two.
[101:41.02]Jesus.
[101:42.36]OK.
[101:44.14]Really pretty in here.
[101:48.19]Save the game.
[101:48.71]I didn't write when I walked in.
[102:02.80]Need a square.
[102:11.95]Square right here.
[102:15.44]We should be a square.
[102:16.36]I think you do square.
[102:25.34]I love the graphics.
[102:33.05]Yeah, it's a very pretty game.
[102:37.24]at six you're watching it at six thousand bitrate even if you're at source um it probably does not do justice with how very pretty the game is the game also has I think a different directx mode I'm on the default mode figured for streaming and probably easier but um yeah it's pretty cool looks really nice
[103:10.26]OK, now we're going to get around.
[103:16.77]How do we get over there?
[103:25.99]Can I go up further?
[103:27.11]I guess maybe I could make that.
[103:30.77]Let's find out.
[103:35.46]This looks like it keeps going.
[103:41.95]Oh.
[103:42.60]Huh.
[104:11.15]Is there a button?
[104:21.04]I don't see anything over here.
[104:26.10]This doesn't count as something, does it?
[104:30.68]Oh wait, is that a button?
[104:32.00]Is this what you mean?
[104:36.40]Hey, friends, that wasn't what I needed to put in there, was it?
[104:40.56]I didn't just shoot that thing that has to go in there, right?
[104:43.92]Friends, that's not what just happened, right?
[104:49.12]No, I doubt that.
[104:50.96]There's another one over here.
[105:01.47]Oh, come on.
[105:02.49]No way, right?
[105:03.93]No way.
[105:08.23]Isn't that... That's just where the cube fits.
[105:11.29]No.
[105:12.61]I don't think so.
[105:15.31]I would be shocked if that's really what it was.
[105:16.65]Well, what the hell?
[105:20.84]I don't know.
[105:38.30]Shit.
[105:42.98]This way?
[105:43.65]Ooh!
[105:43.77]I didn't even see this.
[105:45.53]I'm sorry, buddy.
[105:54.07]I can't help you.
[105:56.37]I really want to.
[105:57.27]I really do.
[105:59.73]That's just sad.
[106:04.12]Sorry, buddy.
[106:13.79]He's cold.
[106:14.45]I know.
[106:14.79]I wish I could give him a blanket or something or like a nice couple of steaks or something.
[106:36.47]What is that?
[106:36.91]Uh-oh.
[106:43.70]Oh.
[106:43.76]Oh, I bet that unlocks, um, permanent upgrade.
[106:47.84]Cool.
[107:14.58]Alright, I need cube.
[107:16.97]Where's cube?
[107:17.49]Where's Vu?
[107:21.63]Come on, Vu.
[107:22.91]You need to get up here.
[107:23.43]Get up here.
[107:34.18]Complete the shrine.
[107:44.86]Get up here.
[107:55.06]Come on up here.
[107:56.08]I need you right now.
[108:02.26]You doofus.
[108:05.90]Come on.
[108:18.24]You are the best.
[108:20.44]Look it.
[108:20.94]You always are on time.
[108:22.06]You always come immediately.
[108:23.70]Look it.
[108:27.07]I'm making sure you're staying alive.
[108:30.47]You're always right behind me.
[108:48.30]God damn it.
[108:49.34]Get up here.
[108:55.45]Where are you?
[108:58.01]Just chilling down here in the water.
[109:00.23]In the freezing cold water, by the way.
[109:09.88]Oh my god.
[109:10.62]He's gonna die.
[109:11.60]He's gonna drown.
[109:15.16]Dude, if you drown, I'm gonna be very, very upset.
[109:57.36]Well.
[109:59.34]I guess I have to eat a cube, but isn't the cube a body?
[110:05.66]The cube is a body, not a head, right?
[110:08.28]I don't know how it works, essentially.
[110:11.39]Just bring a fruit up here.
[110:13.85]Yeah, I was trying to avoid having to do that.
[110:17.89]There's one over here though.
[110:32.12]Float is also body.
[110:33.48]Yeah, somebody else has to eat it up here then.
[110:40.73]One of you has to eat it.
[110:43.37]Come on.
[110:45.37]Let's go.
[110:54.80]Alright, let's try this again.
[111:11.75]Alright, who made it?
[111:13.29]Very, very nice.
[111:15.45]You get it, because you're... I ate it.
[111:37.82]Jump is B. Interact is X. Eat is A. I want Interact to be X. Roll is X. Interact is Y. Eat is B. I don't really like any of these.
[112:06.65]I'll keep it.
[112:07.03]Just have to get used to it.
[112:14.08]So what's down here?
[112:17.44]Ooh.
[112:35.58]Very nice.
[112:37.36]This area is kind of big.
[112:43.31]I've been playing with a different layout.
[112:44.83]Yeah, I was playing with PC controls and then I decided to use controller today.
[112:51.60]Game like this, I probably should have used controller to begin with.
[112:56.34]Pretty much any third person game I prefer on controller.
[113:02.85]Walking around with the analog to me is better than walking around with W and the mouse and like AD.
[113:08.45]Ooh, what's up?
[113:14.36]New mutation?
[113:18.34]No?
[113:20.64]Wait, somebody can turn this into like a bomb or something, right?
[113:37.53]What are your thoughts on your dog?
[113:38.86]Is he a good boy?
[113:39.60]Do you let him cook?
[113:44.26]What?
[113:48.14]What?
[113:48.50]I... Yeah?
[113:49.98]I guess?
[113:50.34]I think so?
[113:55.48]Where's my, um... Where's my offense?
[114:02.51]Oh, whatever.
[114:07.59]this is I don't remember this electricity skin you do it you missed all of them now that that's the fish what is this one
[114:36.90]Oh, it's sticky.
[114:38.02]Sticky.
[114:38.36]Okay.
[114:42.08]Jesus, this looks intense.
[114:44.14]Deep in their memories, the Trebom carried a fragment of knowledge about this temple.
[114:50.94]It had once been a place of learning, where wise Trebom came to study the crystals, which... which... but the memory was incomplete.
[115:02.93]What happened?
[115:05.13]What happened to us?
[115:14.00]Alright, uh, this is gonna be fun.
[115:17.32]Wish me luck.
[115:33.99]Nice.
[115:35.81]Not gonna dump me.
[115:45.85]Pod watchers skip an hour?
[115:47.03]I don't think so.
[116:05.06]Oh, I wanted to do it so bad.
[116:06.44]Fuck.
[116:06.94]It's alright.
[116:07.32]I just should have been patient.
[116:09.24]That's my own fault.
[116:10.32]I should have been patient.
[116:11.49]And I wasn't.
[116:13.37]It's not going to take an hour.
[116:14.39]It's not VOD Watchers.
[116:16.15]I don't have to skip an hour.
[116:17.01]I'm good.
[116:18.33]I got it.
[116:18.71]I got it.
[116:19.01]I got it.
[116:26.93]Okay.
[116:47.49]Fuck!
[116:47.89]No!
[116:48.49]Okay, relax.
[116:49.57]I'm... He's doing it because of the highlight channel.
[116:57.58]No, I'm not.
[116:59.24]I just have no... I just like hate being patient.
[117:06.57]It's so funny.
[117:07.27]It really is.
[117:08.39]I hate it so much.
[117:11.17]So I want to get through this fast.
[117:13.00]I don't want to sit here for this one second.
[117:15.72]This is an eternity to me.
[117:18.16]That right there, that may as well have been 100 years.
[117:25.98]But if I had just done it normally the first time, it would have taken five times less time.
[117:33.19]Like, if I have to stand still in a game or in real life, it may as well be 500 years sitting still.
[117:43.01]That's genuine.
[117:44.07]I mean that.
[118:17.01]this is what I know a lot of people like oh man you should play you know like getting over it or no no I did that and I got maybe I think halfway up the level and I thought I was at the end and when I looked over the chat and they said omega LOL you're only 40 of the way through the game I never turned it on ever again I said well I'm never doing this again
[118:50.78]Oh, Jesus.
[118:51.70]Okay.
[118:53.60]What's the plan here?
[118:54.56]I think I have to drop down.
[119:05.07]Oh, my goodness.
[119:06.09]That's not what I had to do at all, but I somehow made it work.
[119:37.05]Bro is comparing the eternal cylinder puzzle to getting over it.
[119:41.10]No, I'm just saying I don't have very much patience for... I don't have patience.
[120:03.01]That sounds like a you problem.
[120:05.31]Yeah, it is.
[120:07.07]We're all very different.
[120:10.00]Sorry.
[120:12.58]I thought I didn't make it.
[120:18.10]That's some interesting shit right there, whatever this is.
[120:26.72]Who should eat this?
[120:29.00]You.
[120:37.47]I don't know.
[120:38.77]Gunu?
[120:39.11]I feel like Gunu does not have anything.
[120:45.37]I'm giving it to Gunu.
[120:57.50]Nice.
[120:59.94]Part 2?
[121:04.98]There is a Part 2, but hold on.
[121:09.34]Oh, fuck.
[121:10.03]Okay, this is gonna be interesting.
[121:11.51]I need... I can't... I cannot save.
[121:14.63]Look at all these crunchies here.
[121:16.83]It's probably a bad idea, but I'm... I'm about to reset the whole... I'm about to reset the whole thing.
[121:22.73]I'm about to reset the whole thing.
[121:23.77]No, I'm not.
[121:24.09]I'm good.
[121:25.18]Can I breathe in while being stuck?
[121:27.78]I can't.
[121:40.27]Alright, he's gonna face the right way.
[121:46.11]You can still suck while stuck.
[121:48.05]Yep.
[121:58.53]Someone tells me you shouldn't be snorting the random shit on the walls, but whatever.
[122:12.05]I have this game, but you got way further than I did.
[122:18.30]I think it's just a test of... Almost blew it, but we're good.
[122:26.94]You're gonna get lead poisoning.
[122:43.99]This is definitely worth it, even though it's taken a while.
[122:53.56]Sometimes being impatient pays off like right there.
[122:55.42]There was like a 10 to 20% chance that I actually make that.
[123:01.09]But I did.
[123:01.39]So we're good.
[123:15.61]OK, so that's it.
[123:17.43]I just gotta go backwards now.
[123:23.79]It was worth it.
[123:24.29]I got what, three gems?
[123:42.66]Stink bugs are cute.
[123:45.50]Oh, I have a bug story.
[123:55.42]Good thing I fell.
[123:55.94]Alright, so here's the bug story.
[124:07.91]I got it, I'm good, I'm good.
[124:11.17]You know what I want?
[124:19.66]I'm actually probably going to get... Some of you guys are going to pog.
[124:25.24]Some people are going to be like, whoa, I know what that is.
[124:27.89]That's cool, man.
[124:28.89]That's cool.
[124:31.87]I'm going to... If I can.
[124:37.25]I'm going to get... Maybe like three, four.
[124:43.49]And like a little enclosure.
[124:44.91]What's he going to say?
[124:53.51]Blue death-feigning beetles.
[124:58.36]Have you ever seen one?
[125:04.64]I'm at the very bottom.
[125:05.72]Ow.
[125:06.20]I looked over at chat.
[125:07.05]That's fucking whatever.
[125:11.59]I want to get a little enclosure and have some little blue death feigning beetles.
[125:16.45]If you don't know what they are, go look them up.
[125:18.87]They look like the Elden Ring beetles.
[125:21.37]They're this bright blue.
[125:25.31]There are crunchies in the corner.
[125:26.29]Are you full of shit or do you mean that?
[125:33.72]Wait, what do you mean in here?
[125:36.76]I missed crunchies.
[125:39.68]On the bottom you mean?
[125:45.30]Other corner.
[125:48.58]Holy shit.
[125:49.14]This is a lot too.
[125:52.25]That's like a two.
[125:53.17]That's one full crystal rider.
[125:56.69]Actually worth it.
[125:58.19]Alright.
[125:58.51]Let's actually get to the top of this damn thing.
[126:08.55]Yeah, they're apparently one of the easiest things in the world to take care of.
[126:18.26]And they live.
[126:18.90]Do you want to know how long blue death feigning beetles last?
[126:22.77]Nice super villain pet choice.
[126:26.09]Ow.
[126:29.91]My beetles.
[126:36.94]I let them like walk over my fingers.
[126:38.94]Dash the beetles.
[126:40.90]You know about the blue death feigning beetle.
[126:44.38]That's like that.
[126:44.90]That's a monolog moment where like the villain is explaining something.
[126:53.50]Uh, hold on.
[126:53.98]Yeah, so blue death-feigning beetles can live, I think, up to eight to ten years.
[127:03.89]And they're just happy little creatures.
[127:07.57]They eat carrots.
[127:09.95]They like grapes and stuff.
[127:11.53]They're just like little.
[127:12.79]They're not little.
[127:13.51]They're pretty large.
[127:17.37]They're apparently incredibly simple to take care of.
[127:21.29]You just need an enclosure.
[127:22.69]You just need some like sand and shit.
[127:26.30]I would want to make it nice and fun and make sure they had some room.
[127:28.30]What are you going to name them?
[127:44.54]I don't know.
[127:44.90]I need to get them first.
[127:49.14]They're apparently pretty social too.
[127:57.86]They say getting a few.
[127:59.10]They get along with some other insects too.
[128:02.42]I don't think I would do multiple.
[128:03.70]They just were kind of cute looking.
[128:11.48]They do look just like the Elden Ring Dung Beetle though.
[128:15.11]They really do.
[128:15.57]I don't know.
[128:20.07]Just a little friend.
[128:25.91]Can we get a beetle cam?
[128:28.26]That might be kind of fun, actually.
[128:31.74]I'm going to blow this, so I've got to be careful.
[128:34.90]Is anything on the ground?
[128:36.57]Yep.
[128:37.35]Wait.
[128:38.45]I don't care.
[128:39.61]I'm getting it.
[128:45.85]A little beetle camp.
[128:58.59]Okay, that's it.
[129:02.46]Live beetle reaction.
[129:08.14]Recently, I kind of... I think you can call me Bug Andy if you want.
[129:11.86]I don't know.
[129:15.29]It's kind of like a new... I don't want to say hobby, but... There's a lot of really, really crazy beetles and insects and stuff, like scarabs.
[129:23.81]Have you seen some of the scarabs that look like fucking jewels?
[129:29.24]They're remarkable.
[129:30.11]They actually are.
[129:33.07]Some of them are... They're like... Made out of... They look like they have chrome skin.
[129:39.73]They look like emeralds and stuff.
[129:41.01]It's really, really interesting.
[129:43.19]Bro has been watching The Mummy.
[129:45.46]No, I haven't.
[129:52.36]Yeah, so, I mean, I watched The Mummy recently, and now I want bugs.
[130:01.29]Ooh, we found somebody.
[130:11.29]The elder was sad to hear the story of the Trebom and their failed journey behind the cylinder.
[130:18.44]You have been through so much.
[130:21.06]I wish I did not have to place even greater burdens upon you.
[130:25.20]But we Trebom are not meant to live in this cold and cruel place.
[130:30.24]You must continue your voyage.
[130:32.50]You must cross the waters and reach the ancient lands of the desert.
[130:37.25]There lies the only hope for our people.
[130:40.94]You see, we, Trebom, once had the means to sing to the stars and build vessels that allowed us to dance in the heavens.
[130:50.46]Seek one of these floating palaces.
[130:53.21]They may be the key to finding salvation in these times of despair.
[130:58.33]Oh, shit.
[130:59.09]We got to recap somebody here.
[131:01.27]May we meet again someday.
[131:04.06]Somebody said, hey, wait, bro, you went beyond the cylinder.
[131:09.18]We did.
[131:11.40]We did.
[131:12.74]And it was... It was mind-blowing.
[131:17.00]We went to this weird astral heaven world.
[131:20.42]And I'm not making this up.
[131:21.25]It actually happened.
[131:23.01]Go check it out.
[131:23.97]Go check it out.
[131:24.47]Alright, so I gotta find this floating thing in the sky.
[131:27.69]It's just super food.
[131:32.63]Is it just one?
[131:36.52]I thought there were two.
[131:39.14]Cool, alright.
[131:40.74]So let me get out of here now.
[131:45.91]We got 16 rocks here.
[131:50.95]Yeah, I don't know, something about bugs.
[131:55.01]You want, let's get real.
[131:55.95]Let's get real.
[131:56.63]Why not?
[131:57.59]Come on.
[131:59.53]I feel like we kind of treat a lot of insects like they're just random pieces of shit.
[132:04.13]And they're just like meaningless.
[132:07.79]They're like, oh, bug, who cares?
[132:09.29]Crush it.
[132:09.83]Who gives a shit?
[132:10.91]Right?
[132:13.07]There are a lot of really remarkable kind of animals in like the insect world that I think we kind of just gloss over.
[132:26.32]Now, don't get me wrong.
[132:27.28]There are a lot of bugs that are just pieces of absolute dog shit.
[132:36.43]Like, there are some bugs that are just, like, oh, fuck you.
[132:39.53]You know what I mean?
[132:40.83]Like, ticks.
[132:43.13]Murder hornets.
[132:45.05]Like, horribly aggressive wasps and yellow jackets.
[132:48.11]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:50.05]I'm not talking about that.
[132:53.21]Don't hurt us, please.
[132:55.94]What the?
[132:56.66]That scared the shit out of me.
[132:59.80]Is he alright?
[133:01.50]I thought he was gone.
[133:02.60]Alright, I need to heal.
[133:04.07]That actually... Oh, no, I activated it.
[133:07.10]Oh, okay.
[133:07.82]We gotta go.
[133:14.14]I don't know what direction I gotta go from here.
[133:15.56]Alright, right here.
[133:19.59]I feel like a cockroach.
[133:20.83]Yeah.
[133:23.91]Well, the thing is, cockroaches, I mean, it, like, flies.
[133:26.95]They have a very important part of our ecosystem.
[133:30.15]Okay.
[133:34.51]Like decomposing.
[133:36.73]Decomposition, right?
[133:40.21]Hold on, let me get safe here for a second.
[133:49.13]Oh boy.
[133:51.27]No!
[133:53.67]Weewom?
[133:55.55]Who is Weewom?
[133:59.88]Oh no, he's a sad.
[134:07.51]Where are you going?
[134:09.37]Don't go that way.
[134:10.13]Where are you going?
[134:11.35]Why are you going over there?
[134:13.67]Why is he going over there?
[134:14.91]What's his problem?
[134:16.31]What's his problem?
[134:20.58]Do not do that.
[134:27.18]What is his problem?
[134:28.86]What is his problem?
[134:37.75]Jesus.
[134:41.29]Okay, we need to figure out what just happened.
[134:42.83]It's okay.
[135:00.46]I have a lot.
[135:01.04]We can upgrade.
[135:03.80]Reload?
[135:04.22]No, I can't.
[135:09.01]Was Wiwom the trumpet guy?
[135:12.15]The dead one was the mixer.
[135:21.82]Oh, we can't live without Wiwom.
[135:36.13]In fact, I need to control Weewam because Weewam is the one that actually can hurt people.
[135:40.13]Alright.
[135:41.01]Now, before I blow this, turn around.
[135:47.23]Save scum.
[135:48.83]Yeah, that's fine.
[135:52.15]Alright.
[135:52.47]Are we good?
[135:53.67]Let's eat.
[135:56.78]Yeah, it's okay to save scum.
[135:58.68]Wait, we didn't even know what this does.
[136:01.32]Eat it.
[136:12.75]Minerals?
[136:13.13]You can process minerals.
[136:19.09]Interesting.
[136:19.63]So, the crystals.
[136:21.67]I get it.
[136:22.13]Alright.
[136:22.47]Well, let's get to a safe spot here.
[136:25.45]Wait.
[136:25.63]Don't have to go yet.
[136:31.42]So, all those red and blue crystals can be processed by that now.
[136:37.22]Okay.
[136:40.44]What's in here?
[136:43.04]Vegan.
[136:44.80]Vegan.
[136:47.44]Okay.
[137:05.91]Even if I find an egg, I can't hatch it right now anyways.
[137:11.52]Leave him.
[137:12.14]Well, I have to.
[137:14.94]There's an egg here.
[137:18.78]I'm gonna... Can I... Can I bring the egg?
[137:24.55]I don't think I can bring it.
[137:26.81]I'll try.
[137:27.19]Because there's a upgrade temple over there.
[137:34.41]I'm gonna... There's no way.
[137:45.96]I'm sorry bro, you're dead.
[138:08.08]I can light it on fire with my trunk.
[138:09.84]The problem is we can't put him in the party because I only have six or seven slots.
[138:14.26]We can't.
[138:15.98]He cannot join.
[138:16.66]OK, much cleaner than last time.
[138:26.90]Alright.
[138:34.73]The next thing we've got here.
[138:37.67]Jesus.
[138:41.72]Coming up next.
[138:44.96]We got the temple here.
[138:45.76]I can upgrade.
[138:47.36]Which is perfect.
[138:49.17]Plenty of food.
[138:49.79]I got my party.
[138:52.01]I got the mineral processor.
[138:54.61]Which there's going to be a ton of crystals in this cave.
[139:00.20]What's the cube do?
[139:01.64]Cube can fit into cube slots.
[139:04.94]Only somebody that has the cube mutation can fit into a cube slot, which allows to open some doors.
[139:21.81]Alright.
[139:22.35]I got a lot of money.
[139:24.28]It's time to make some real decisions.
[139:27.36]I'm going to have probably 20 crystals.
[139:36.31]Excuse me.
[139:41.01]Lots of crystals in here.
[139:44.81]In fact.
[139:46.69]Let's start this.
[139:47.43]What does it turn it into?
[139:48.65]I wonder.
[139:51.57]What do you do?
[139:53.71]OK, a bunch of crystals pick up everything.
[139:59.66]Let's make food wonder.
[140:05.15]Takes a while, not as fast as some of the other shit.
[140:20.04]What does it do?
[140:30.06]Oh, it gives you crystal dust.
[140:35.73]That's pretty good.
[140:37.65]How much does it give?
[140:38.39]I didn't see.
[140:38.93]Holy shit, that gives a lot.
[140:46.98]That's a. That's a lot.
[141:00.59]Wait, should I eat this?
[141:04.50]I'm gonna eat it.
[141:05.96]Okay.
[141:26.75]No, no, no.
[141:29.31]I feel like it's gonna be a lot.
[141:32.57]The attractive crystal.
[141:33.79]I think it's gonna be a lot.
[141:35.18]You should break it first.
[141:36.02]Maybe I don't think I should.
[141:37.92]I wonder because it's it's counts as a crystal right now.
[141:44.30]Alright, we definitely need leadership.
[141:46.68]I know I'm doing that for a fact.
[141:48.66]Maybe the stamina wheel.
[141:56.56]Give orange meteors to smelt.
[142:04.12]Did I miss any crunchies?
[142:16.45]Water storage.
[142:17.25]I feel like the water is not a problem.
[142:22.34]Alright, let's do leadership.
[142:24.04]Yep.
[142:32.17]Try to do it again.
[142:32.75]We could have nine.
[142:37.67]Give the orange meteorite.
[142:48.17]Oh, you're right.
[142:49.65]Yes, you are absolutely right.
[142:51.19]I've been holding on to these things for a long time.
[142:53.17]Oh, yep.
[142:56.66]Look at how long it's taking, too.
[142:57.80]Alright, we're doing it again.
[143:06.41]Now I can actually get more people, and I'm probably gonna get more from this shit.
[143:12.19]Can you summarize this game in 15 words or less?
[143:13.97]Yeah, sure.
[143:16.26]Little creatures on a planet being destroyed by a huge rolling pin must find a way to activate their memories to figure out why this is happening, and what the heck's going on behind that cylinder?
[143:36.51]There you go.
[143:38.51]Alright, I want to.
[143:39.33]I'm going to wait this out because I want to.
[143:41.44]I bet you I get a lot from this.
[143:47.64]Bro, who made the first sauce?
[143:57.44]This is gonna take awhile.
[144:05.00]Health.
[144:06.62]How much is stamina wheel?
[144:08.88]Alright, I'm doing stamina wheel.
[144:11.52]And... Look at how many more crystals are up here.
[144:17.02]I need them.
[144:18.00]Look at all of them.
[144:18.48]I need them all.
[144:23.91]Holy shit, there's so many crystals.
[144:25.19]How do I... I need to get all of these.
[144:26.49]Every single one.
[144:27.05]I'm not leaving until I have them all.
[144:35.08]Who has the inflating head?
[144:36.94]You do.
[144:37.21]Come here.
[144:38.15]Come here, Kwe.
[144:50.39]Shit.
[144:51.10]Can't get up there.
[144:51.62]Can we shoot them down with water?
[145:09.85]Come on, I need more of those crystals.
[145:13.53]Yes!
[145:30.43]Float up there.
[145:57.46]Look at all these.
[145:58.00]Alright, come over here.
[146:23.06]Get another smelter.
[146:23.86]I could double it up.
[146:28.48]You.
[146:28.66]You're going to be a smelter.
[146:32.82]How much was that?
[146:33.34]Alright, smelter.
[146:37.86]Come here.
[146:41.94]Where did it go?
[146:42.92]Right here.
[146:50.45]This is really fun.
[146:52.43]It is pretty fun.
[146:56.51]I very much enjoy it.
[147:03.49]Okay, how much is this going to go for?
[147:12.92]Nine.
[147:18.26]Well, that was worth it.
[147:19.04]Holy shit.
[147:19.64]Okay.
[147:21.00]Stamina wheel.
[147:25.10]Okay.
[147:30.82]I don't know if I'll be able to get anything else.
[147:32.20]There's more crystals over on the corner, I think.
[147:34.40]There are more.
[147:40.28]Come on, dislodge these.
[148:15.77]That should be enough to do one more thing with the meteorite.
[148:25.39]Uh, there's water in the middle.
[148:26.67]Should be fine.
[148:28.30]What should I do?
[148:30.16]Can you stomp them down?
[148:31.14]Uh, maybe.
[148:32.42]Let's find out.
[148:33.66]Maybe I can, like, blow them out of the wall?
[148:39.54]You can't really aim, so I'm just gonna...
[148:49.39]I think these ones are way too lodged in.
[149:02.06]I'd have to jump all the way up.
[149:04.52]Maybe... There we go.
[149:09.95]Alright.
[149:11.87]I'll give these to the other one.
[149:18.57]I missed a raid, shit.
[149:20.15]I missed... Ramallah?
[149:24.93]That's from a long time ago.
[149:26.55]Oh, shit.
[149:26.92]I'm sorry.
[149:27.28]It's a lot of people.
[149:28.88]You're still here?
[149:29.64]Thanks for the stream.
[149:31.76]Well, thanks for the stream.
[149:33.88]You were streaming.
[149:34.76]Thanks for that stream.
[149:38.24]Thanks for the stream.
[149:42.20]Okay.
[149:42.30]Okay.
[149:45.25]You.
[149:46.45]Process these.
[149:49.64]You fell.
[150:04.18]Don't.
[150:06.14]Yeah.
[150:11.11]Process.
[150:14.89]Alright.
[150:15.83]Now let's go talk.
[150:27.12]I'm sorry.
[150:27.58]I'm so... I am so anal about this.
[150:29.84]I just want every single one of them.
[150:35.48]Thank God.
[150:47.65]Oh, that's not what it is.
[150:51.76]Ignites a small flame.
[150:57.58]I thought I had one of these, like, Jawbreakers.
[150:59.92]I guess not.
[151:06.16]Didn't I have one of those?
[151:08.26]Somebody does.
[151:08.90]I think one of the other people has one.
[151:21.45]What, I said anal?
[151:21.99]Huh?
[151:26.47]I've never heard that phrase before.
[151:34.84]What?
[151:38.81]Have you never heard that phrase?
[151:41.21]What are you on about?
[151:55.95]How have you never heard that before?
[151:57.63]Alright, I... Okay.
[152:02.82]I'm waiting for... this to be completely processed.
[152:07.90]We're at seven now.
[152:09.16]Perfect.
[152:12.02]Digested food is seven.
[152:14.04]I think it's probably a good idea, but what... Hold on.
[152:15.96]Is anything else... I don't think I upgraded something once.
[152:19.13]That's stamina.
[152:19.71]I just did it.
[152:21.69]Is water... Am I neglecting water?
[152:23.69]Is it bad...
[152:30.17]Maybe I shouldn't.
[152:34.93]I feel like I have to do it at least once.
[152:41.49]It's level one.
[152:51.51]People are going to freak out.
[152:53.97]I got two crystal processors now.
[152:56.14]We're going to be fine.
[152:59.72]I haven't upgraded water once.
[153:01.39]It's probably going to be a problem soon.
[153:04.57]Alright.
[153:07.11]I am ready.
[153:11.35]I do need three crystals to make this thing.
[153:15.23]I think there's a jawbreaker in my storage.
[153:18.84]So I think we're good.
[153:22.04]Everyone's healthy.
[153:22.80]Everyone's happy.
[153:23.46]Got plenty of food.
[153:25.52]Let's go.
[153:33.77]The apparition spoke to the trebum.
[153:36.95]Do not leave this cave without extracting its riches, it said.
[153:42.36]The walls hide valuable minerals necessary for our recipes and other important matters.
[153:49.94]Now, while the common trebum has no way of processing them, our crafty ancestors created a mutation capable of performing such a task.
[154:02.26]The apparition faded.
[154:04.63]And the Trebom was sad.
[154:07.39]It was almost like losing one of their elders.
[154:10.23]Oh, that's not... Look at him.
[154:11.49]He's sad.
[154:13.85]He's sad.
[154:14.39]Oh.
[154:17.40]Okay.
[154:29.30]Need three stones.
[154:30.69]They're in every single one of those caves.
[154:39.04]Alright, where to?
[154:41.64]No more points of interest.
[154:44.68]Nope.
[154:45.74]This is going to be weird though.
[154:47.50]I'm going to go to the other side of this.
[154:48.61]Yeah.
[155:02.68]Alright, it's over there.
[155:05.99]Alright, I gotta get the right spot.
[155:09.08]And... Nope.
[155:29.23]This one's quick.
[155:30.85]Uh-oh.
[155:31.19]Uh-oh.
[155:52.87]I had to cut a few of these corners here.
[156:01.17]Okay, I think I'm good.
[156:05.54]Alright, get everybody through.
[156:11.36]We did it!
[156:16.74]Aha!
[156:19.94]Aha!
[156:32.44]There's no light coming off of it.
[156:34.14]No point of interest.
[156:36.53]We might be able to find a few friends.
[156:41.34]Hmm.
[156:42.96]Interesting.
[156:48.00]Interesting.
[156:56.63]Mm-hmm.
[156:58.03]Mm-hmm.
[157:01.14]I haven't really figured out what the deal with these are.
[157:04.54]Is there a deal or does it just look interesting?
[157:06.57]Is it a friend?
[157:07.83]Okay.
[157:44.45]It is pumping.
[157:44.85]Oh, they're all scared.
[157:45.37]What if I do this?
[158:23.82]Hi.
[158:23.94]Are you okay?
[158:26.60]Are we... Uh... I don't know.
[158:42.60]Do I have to fill it up?
[158:43.70]Maybe I have to fill it up.
[158:44.36]Maybe I have to fill it up.
[158:47.67]The warmer it got, the more the monstrous creature seemed to start losing control of its body.
[158:54.67]That must be its weakness.
[158:57.07]Alright, warmth.
[158:58.96]Warmth!
[159:02.28]Oh shit!
[159:03.04]Is everybody alright?
[159:11.46]Who needs health?
[159:18.63]I think I need to heal.
[159:19.17]Alright, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[159:28.92]Where's my fire?
[159:34.77]That's the right idea.
[159:35.43]Alright, fire.
[159:37.73]Come here.
[159:45.58]Fire!
[159:45.92]Breathe the fire!
[160:03.75]Someone's there.
[160:09.11]Got it.
[160:10.85]You get the fuck away from me.
[160:15.52]That's a heart now.
[160:16.56]I can eat that.
[160:18.10]Get out of here.
[160:20.12]Get out of here.
[160:21.26]Get out of here.
[160:22.08]Stop.
[160:23.66]Get out of here.
[160:25.44]I don't know what the hell that is, but I gotta move though.
[160:28.04]Because this fucking annoying thing is just
[160:35.06]Leave me alone.
[160:38.12]Nobody has a horn.
[160:42.74]Okay.
[160:43.84]Let me just double check to make sure nothing else is over here.
[160:47.18]What about this shit?
[160:48.70]This looks fucking cool.
[160:55.08]More fire.
[160:55.62]Alright, I'm gonna... Ooh!
[160:59.19]Alright, alright, alright.
[161:00.35]Hold on.
[161:04.38]I feel like there's something with these.
[161:07.75]Right?
[161:08.37]Like, there's gotta be something I can do with this.
[161:15.93]Stomp them?
[161:19.96]Okay, that worked, but did they drop anything?
[161:29.58]They don't.
[161:30.00]Oh, a hair horn.
[161:34.00]Okay, shit's dangerous.
[161:35.78]Who should eat this?
[161:41.66]I don't know what this is going to do.
[161:46.33]Maybe you in the middle here?
[161:51.43]Goon?
[161:53.71]Goon?
[161:55.65]If this is a body, I guess we do have an extra smelter.
[162:01.98]Yeah, there's still, there's an extra smelter.
[162:04.06]Alright, let's try it.
[162:10.08]I don't want to craft these, but you know, that's as long as I have one, somebody else has to hold onto these.
[162:26.26]You know, you hold onto that energy bomb.
[162:33.09]OK, Gunu.
[162:37.43]Eat it.
[162:37.66]I want the truth.
[162:49.12]Regenerating body.
[162:50.40]OK.
[163:01.23]Somebody should take this too.
[163:05.52]we need a horn very important okay very very cool so that was the big thing here anything else let me get some food
[163:41.37]Hunu sucks.
[163:43.27]What?
[163:43.55]No, he doesn't.
[163:45.19]Alright, it's straight and then right.
[163:49.54]Let's go.
[164:17.52]I got time Can you get somebody?
[164:26.00]No
[164:30.02]Oh, I spent too much time trying to blow the horn against that.
[164:34.08]They're all dead.
[164:34.58]Everybody's dead.
[164:35.28]We're all fucking dead, man.
[164:37.10]We're dead.
[164:37.70]We're dead.
[164:39.12]Everybody's gonna die.
[164:41.70]Everybody's gonna die.
[164:43.81]Oh, no.
[164:50.73]It's alright.
[164:51.21]We're good.
[164:51.53]Alright.
[164:55.93]This time, don't even blow the horn.
[165:00.61]Go.
[165:46.07]I think I got it.
[165:49.85]Get in there!
[165:50.71]Everybody in!
[165:55.53]Come on!
[166:00.33]We made it.
[166:03.07]Dangerous.
[166:07.81]Beware, the voice in their memories cried out.
[166:11.31]The mathematician has been summoned.
[166:14.72]What do we do?
[166:19.19]He's pulling it out with his hands.
[166:20.57]Is that... What does that do?
[166:24.63]What does that mean for us?
[166:25.79]Did he get it?
[166:37.81]He got it.
[166:38.47]Okay, it's gonna be lightning shit.
[166:45.96]it lightning or is it not it's just going uh okay why am I standing around because a lot sometimes it's purple and you have to stay near it but I guess that's not the case right now no there's an egg what the
[167:20.92]That's so far away.
[167:42.08]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[168:05.45]Go!
[168:08.45]Everybody make it.
[168:13.49]I think we got it.
[168:14.05]We got it?
[168:19.33]Everybody's safe.
[168:19.83]I think.
[168:22.81]As the Trebim continued their voyage to the desert, they felt a strange sense of being observed.
[168:30.01]But this was not the cruel gaze of the cylinder and its servants.
[168:34.79]no it was almost as if someone was trying to help them laying out a path for them to find the voice and their memories encouraged them to go forward alright there's a couple points of interest here which we will very much investigate when I go get another tea go pee and come back I'll be right back see you in a minute
[175:00.95]Those of you that are wondering, I did see the emu.
[175:08.76]Pretty cool.
[175:11.90]I know that people in the Discord were very, very adamant that I see this bird.
[175:18.68]What do you mean?
[175:19.72]Okay, so...
[175:25.17]Let me explain.
[175:26.41]For those of you that don't have any idea, you just... Oh, yeah, I saw the emu.
[175:30.25]Like, what?
[175:31.73]Is he alright?
[175:32.30]I don't know.
[175:33.84]Somebody in the Discord uploaded a picture of, like, an emu in my room saying, get an emu pet instead of the beetles.
[175:43.59]And I was like, alright.
[175:44.83]I was like, we need him to see this.
[175:46.93]Okay, I saw it.
[175:53.42]Got a lemon ginger tea this time.
[175:55.87]I'm getting a little wacky.
[175:57.39]Yeah, I'm lemon ginger.
[176:04.33]Slow down.
[176:04.89]No, this is cool.
[176:14.04]Okay.
[176:14.78]I got to let it sit for a minute though.
[176:17.67]The problem I have with tea, hot tea in particular, is I will brew it and let it just sit on a counter or something.
[176:27.36]And the bags just stay in there for 10 minutes and it just ruins everything.
[176:30.02]Because then you get that weird, that bad taste.
[176:35.42]It's got a certain name.
[176:36.16]What's it called?
[176:39.82]There's actually, like, it's a bad thing, right?
[176:42.78]Something leaches into the tea.
[176:44.56]What's it called?
[176:48.89]Tannins, yeah.
[176:50.93]Yeah, tannins leach in there and it's just, eh, it's not good.
[176:58.27]Tannins aren't bad, but they're bitter.
[176:59.62]Yeah, well, not necessarily bad, but bad in the sense of you don't want to taste it.
[177:02.96]Alright, I'll give it... Hey, please remind me, because I will forget.
[177:13.30]In two minutes, take the tea bags out of the drink.
[177:17.11]I know, I can rely on you guys.
[177:18.17]I know I can.
[177:22.41]Let's go.
[177:28.89]Still got everybody.
[177:29.43]I was just laughing about this, though, while I was making the tea.
[177:34.43]I think this game, you're supposed to lose creatures and get new ones.
[177:39.32]But I just keep save scumming with the same ones that we have because I don't want to lose anybody.
[177:45.20]Every time we've come across a new couple of creatures in a new zone like this, I think it's designed for it to be, oh, you lost one back there.
[177:53.06]Don't worry, there's another one here.
[177:54.46]But we just keep passing everybody by.
[177:58.82]We have, I feel so bad.
[178:00.44]We have our team and I don't want to lose anybody.
[178:05.35]Oh, we're going in here.
[178:13.91]A lot of crunchies.
[178:22.44]Uh, jumping legs for this for sure.
[178:26.25]Who could use it?
[178:28.35]And a cube.
[178:28.87]I have a cube, don't I?
[178:31.17]Yes, I do have a cube.
[178:42.02]What'd I do?
[178:42.36]I don't know, but get out of the water.
[178:48.70]What did that do?
[178:52.26]Oh, turn this on.
[178:53.36]There's an egg right there as well.
[178:55.24]I'll come back down and get it.
[178:55.88]I just want to get out of the... Oh, shit.
[178:57.38]Cool.
[178:59.98]You do this.
[179:00.51]You take it.
[179:00.87]Okay, so that's the way to get out.
[179:11.55]Um...
[179:25.37]Oh my fucking god, they're gonna die.
[179:28.57]Come on, man.
[179:29.63]I can't eat it from the menu?
[179:43.32]Why not?
[179:51.77]Thank god I had that.
[180:01.23]Jesus.
[180:01.77]Okay, that was almost a disaster.
[180:05.95]There's a lot down.
[180:06.95]I wish I could just leave people up here.
[180:09.92]Tannins, the tannins, the tannins.
[180:11.12]Okay, I got it.
[180:12.28]Thank you.
[180:17.40]It's really been two minutes.
[180:18.32]Time flies.
[180:20.90]Okay.
[180:25.13]I gotta do the dunk, pull, dunk, pull, dunk, pull, dunk, pull, because I don't feel like stirring it.
[180:32.89]OK, transferring.
[180:36.87]Transfer success.
[180:38.87]No mess.
[180:41.89]Alright, let's go.
[180:43.21]There's a bunch of shit down here.
[180:46.48]I'm getting it all.
[180:52.50]Gotta go quick.
[180:58.92]Crystals, yup.
[181:04.44]Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[181:06.70]The egg.
[181:12.82]I hate jumping on the rocks in this game.
[181:25.34]Hurry up.
[181:27.40]Hurry up.
[181:29.39]Hurry up.
[181:31.83]Guovo.
[181:32.11]Alright, Guovo, let's go.
[181:33.65]We gotta get up now.
[181:40.05]I can't get all this shit.
[181:44.06]Ah, greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[182:01.23]Everybody's alive, just barely.
[182:02.57]I need health so bad.
[182:13.10]It's so dangerous down there.
[182:15.24]Every single one of them just follows you in.
[182:17.88]And they just die in the water.
[182:19.22]Okay, everyone just regen out of combat.
[182:26.93]Pretty good.
[182:32.99]I didn't even get to see the new guy.
[182:37.97]Where is the new guy?
[182:39.59]Is it this?
[182:39.89]Is it you?
[182:41.87]Oh, cool.
[182:44.60]What's up?
[182:55.91]Watch out.
[182:57.87]Alright, anything else I can do here?
[182:59.33]I did the hole.
[183:02.55]There is this.
[183:03.79]Let's go do this.
[183:08.06]I think this is probably a... Yep, let's do that.
[183:16.94]How many crystals do I have?
[183:21.66]Because I can get another party member.
[183:24.50]I can do it.
[183:26.25]I need six mushrooms.
[183:27.53]Do I have six mushrooms?
[183:34.43]I don't think I... Hold on.
[183:35.99]I don't have six mushrooms.
[183:41.13]Guto!
[183:44.04]Alright, I need six mushrooms.
[183:46.46]Keep an eye out.
[183:51.14]Oh, wait, there's an upload tank over here.
[183:52.51]Look at my mushrooms.
[184:02.85]Fire.
[184:08.50]Fire.
[184:14.45]Upload tank.
[184:15.57]I could pull somebody out.
[184:28.60]Who's in here?
[184:34.00]Rutemu and Wugwul are in here.
[184:39.04]I could also revive Govu or Gluwin.
[184:45.14]I do have room for one more.
[184:55.77]Rotemu?
[184:59.49]Hmm.
[185:08.84]Bugwool?
[185:11.22]I mean, this is free.
[185:25.76]I think we're at our capacity.
[185:28.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[185:29.68]Can we have 9?
[185:37.95]What about Govu?
[185:40.21]Govu is still there in spirit.
[185:42.43]Oh, here we go.
[185:50.35]I need one more mushroom.
[185:51.65]Nobody eat one.
[185:55.44]I need one more mushroom and I can go get the other.
[186:00.96]Here we go.
[186:01.84]Okay.
[186:05.86]Rescue.
[186:06.22]Let's go.
[186:18.79]Is it eight or nine?
[186:22.68]If it's 8, I'll just put somebody back.
[186:25.62]Okay, so it is.
[186:30.32]Which one of you is the least interesting?
[186:35.94]Fire Stomp Eyes Regeneration Horn Cube Jump Sticky Feet Fuzzy Air Head Webbed Feet and
[186:53.88]Anti-poison.
[186:57.41]What's your deal?
[187:00.03]What's your deal?
[187:00.71]You got nothing.
[187:04.79]I like the way you look, though.
[187:08.11]That's the new guy.
[187:10.47]Yeah.
[187:13.27]Should we... Should we get Guto?
[187:16.96]Yeah, I want Guto.
[187:18.52]Alright, I'm gonna put Wugwul back.
[187:31.16]rid of the crest 3D white one now you were you were really close that was really funny but you meant to say aqua fresh shower clean that's what it is it's not crest it's aqua fresh
[187:52.54]Joke was there.
[187:53.06]Wait.
[187:53.16]What happened to the... Wait a minute.
[187:55.68]What's going on?
[188:25.78]Jesus.
[188:27.64]Oh.
[188:34.24]Well, this is the group we have.
[188:35.98]What the fuck?
[188:36.54]Crystals though.
[188:50.81]SCORN-like.
[188:52.32]This actually is a SCORN-like.
[188:53.58]I agree.
[189:00.02]I see it.
[189:00.46]I understand that.
[189:02.60]Neve the Elder.
[189:05.16]What is going on?
[189:23.95]uh hi perhaps this strange elder could tell them what was going on but before they could ask the elder spoke the celestial travala have seen your journey and I have been told of your deeds why was it why are they trying to kill us between our people trebum and travala
[189:50.77]We once lived in harmony, but the invasion of our world has split us apart.
[189:56.88]If you do not know their song, the Trophala will not recognize you as a friend, so I am here to help you, as much as I can.
[190:07.71]The floating palaces you seek lie ahead, as you were told.
[190:12.35]but they will be of no use to you unless you reclaim all the powers of our people, which the Cylinder has stolen.
[190:22.10]There is only one way to do so, by entering the portal that links our world to the dreams of the Eternal Cylinder.
[190:31.81]The greatest of the Cylinder's servants, the Mathematician, is the Gatekeeper.
[190:37.71]He absorbs that which is of value to the Cylinder, and his master has become intrigued by the crystals that the Trafalgar wear as crowns.
[190:48.42]Find these crystals and acquire the mutation which will allow you to appear as one of them.
[190:55.38]Wahoo!
[190:55.66]Yehoo!
[191:25.75]hold on so okay we need to get the crystal we're beginning to understand that there was more to this journey than mere survival so far they had acted only for themselves
[191:51.10]But now they had been entrusted with a task that would affect many others.
[191:57.41]And although that was frightening, the knowledge that they were acting for the greater good gave them strength.
[192:04.27]So we're going to look like a crystal that's on top of one of those serpent heads.
[192:14.49]I wonder how we do that.
[192:16.59]It will unfold.
[192:18.19]In front of us, I imagine the next several hours.
[192:21.35]Alright, let's go store one of these.
[192:24.63]Well, that was a cool scene.
[192:41.84]I mean, Wugwool, you just got... Maybe it shouldn't be Wugwool.
[192:46.83]Swimming.
[192:47.23]Hmm.
[192:57.33]Hmm.
[192:58.23]We're in Ice World.
[192:59.35]I don't think we need Wugwool.
[193:00.29]Sorry.
[193:00.47]Well, you got a little bit of exercise.
[193:01.61]I'm going to go back in.
[193:09.43]OK, now let's go get the new character.
[193:25.91]Send his ass back to hell.
[193:27.35]That's not how he's in the cloud.
[193:33.19]Who's this?
[193:33.71]Viv we know?
[193:38.09]This person's... This is different.
[193:41.95]Voino is... kind of way cooler.
[193:47.29]This is not Guto.
[193:51.67]But look at... But look at Voino.
[193:53.71]Hmm.
[194:01.89]Okay.
[194:04.79]Hmm.
[194:06.80]Alright, well, I have the mushroom, so I'm doing it.
[194:08.52]Gotta remember where that was.
[194:12.84]Over here, isn't it?
[194:15.78]Oops, sorry.
[194:19.30]Where is it?
[194:26.40]Yeah, where's Guto?
[194:35.32]Where is that?
[194:37.93]He got replaced?
[194:40.49]Oh, fuck.
[194:44.60]You come near me, I'm going to blow you to hell.
[194:47.46]I'm just saying.
[194:47.98]I'm just saying.
[194:48.78]I'm just saying.
[194:49.30]Did he get replaced?
[195:01.19]I think he got replaced.
[195:03.67]Yeah, I think he's replaced.
[195:07.25]The cutscene replaced him.
[195:16.93]But that's annoying.
[195:22.36]Go get that ice monster.
[195:24.72]I want to upgrade before I do that.
[195:40.88]There are... I did get some crystals.
[195:43.38]Uh-huh.
[195:48.55]Nice.
[195:49.97]There's gonna be a shitload of crystals probably in here.
[196:12.37]I need three of these.
[196:16.50]Make sure I do not get rid of three of these.
[196:21.78]Mushrooms are fine because we're not... Guto's not available anymore.
[196:25.98]So that's all good.
[196:26.64]Five.
[196:36.71]Uh-huh.
[196:38.13]Ooh.
[196:39.41]There's a big one.
[196:59.68]Very nice.
[197:01.26]Yep.
[197:04.89]Can these be broken?
[197:12.87]Well, I currently have a full party, so I'm not too concerned about it.
[197:32.67]Okay, let me get these to the processor.
[197:39.30]Cool.
[198:00.61]Throw the tea.
[198:01.73]The tea's fine.
[198:02.93]Nice and hot.
[198:12.88]Yeah, I took the tea bags out.
[198:14.02]You guys are like 40 minutes late.
[198:15.70]I already did it.
[198:22.32]Alright, I need whatever that is.
[198:24.22]Like a tongue or something?
[198:25.79]What is that?
[198:37.64]Jerma, the tannins.
[198:38.72]Jerma, the tannins.
[198:40.86]Oh, shit.
[198:41.32]Tannins, you're right.
[198:44.69]Ah, it's ruined.
[198:45.69]Okay.
[198:51.45]What do I do?
[198:53.20]Stamina wheel?
[198:54.78]I have 12.
[198:57.58]I don't think you can go wrong with the stamina wheel for health.
[199:09.98]There we go.
[199:13.58]I wonder if I'll have enough to do health.
[199:18.08]In the meantime... Hello?
[199:23.93]The projection shared a recipe with the trebam.
[199:28.03]One which could protect them from the light of the cylinder's servants.
[199:35.59]Permanent inflatable body.
[199:41.92]Oh, I got to start paying attention to this.
[199:51.62]Six mushrooms and three luffies.
[199:58.59]Two fish, two crystals.
[200:04.33]Okay.
[200:06.83]Okay.
[200:08.75]Alright.
[200:09.43]Alright.
[200:12.11]I don't think I can do that for a while, so let's track a different one.
[200:14.72]How about Inflatable?
[200:20.34]Probably this one.
[200:21.44]Yeah.
[200:24.44]Yeah.
[200:28.29]Yep, this was made by the Rock of Ages dev.
[200:30.67]Also Xenoclash.
[200:40.59]How much crystals do I have?
[200:44.82]Two, three.
[200:45.26]Alright, I got more stamina.
[200:48.44]I'm happy with it.
[200:55.22]Gunu is still alive, yeah.
[200:57.60]Wait, let me get some water.
[200:58.37]Okay.
[201:03.75]Okay.
[201:15.15]Okay, I think I'm good to go.
[201:18.06]I've got the crystals I need.
[201:19.36]Is there any water?
[201:26.26]Cool, let's get out of here.
[201:32.84]You should name one of the beetles Gunu.
[201:36.60]That might be cute.
[201:44.02]You dead?
[201:46.99]What the hell was that?
[201:49.76]I need these.
[201:50.20]I need three of these, right?
[201:52.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[202:04.77]Somebody else pick it up, please.
[202:06.17]You.
[202:12.57]It's three fluffies.
[202:19.50]Is the suck sound off?
[202:22.62]Oh, I can't hear the sucking.
[202:38.32]Alright, I need six mushrooms and I can do this one.
[202:47.75]I don't think I want to fuck around with that.
[202:50.60]I'm probably going to need that material to have a permanent upgrade.
[202:55.86]It's terrifying to me and I don't really want to fight it.
[202:59.46]Should I?
[203:41.85]Who's got the horn?
[203:42.45]Who has the horn?
[203:48.14]Who's got the horn?
[203:49.18]I need to use it right now.
[203:50.42]Nobody has the horn.
[203:52.13]Unu has the horn?
[204:15.56]He doesn't even care.
[204:17.89]Why am I hurt getting hurt?
[204:21.96]Don't you an idiot?
[204:45.03]It's actually really annoying to pick people with the controller.
[204:51.63]That's not who I wanted.
[205:07.21]Oh shit.
[205:09.31]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[205:10.43]Dangerous.
[205:10.81]It's dangerous over here.
[205:11.45]It's dangerous.
[205:13.35]Nice.
[205:13.67]Alright, pick it up.
[205:15.41]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[205:16.67]Alright, somebody needs to be just the person that holds everything.
[205:28.22]I think it's gonna have to be Weewam.
[205:33.42]Just don't eat that.
[205:34.38]I need health.
[205:41.16]That could have gone worse.
[205:49.74]See any mushrooms yell.
[206:09.91]Fucking ice monster died from poop rocks.
[206:14.42]It works, it works.
[206:21.67]Use the eye.
[206:28.53]Ah, now you're thinking.
[206:38.15]Ah!
[206:40.47]Yes!
[206:41.23]Need one.
[206:47.37]Six, right?
[206:55.24]I'm going to trip the wall.
[206:59.07]So where am I going from here?
[207:00.73]Actually don't know.
[207:09.60]Is the wall right here?
[207:40.85]Yes, OK, let's do it.
[207:45.42]OK, so this is.
[207:46.24]And the bird skin permanent mutation.
[207:53.60]Are these permanent?
[207:54.34]Because that's pretty big deal if it's permanent.
[208:07.73]What else can I do?
[208:08.31]Okay.
[208:10.21]This one's third eye.
[208:12.15]This is probably the closest one I have.
[208:16.68]I wonder if I can look it up with the third eye.
[208:18.94]Any of these organs anywhere?
[208:25.78]I'll keep it on.
[208:26.86]Alright, well that's good.
[208:29.25]Now they just automatically enable it when they need it.
[208:31.77]That's a big deal.
[208:32.47]Okay, so...
[208:35.36]We are good to continue moving.
[208:38.12]I'm going to select somebody else.
[208:44.18]You got like a missile.
[208:45.04]Okay, you got bombs.
[208:45.86]Did you activate it?
[208:55.77]I don't think I could.
[209:06.88]Check this one last thing over here.
[209:11.86]Actually, I probably should stay with, um.
[209:15.28]We bomb.
[209:16.74]Just in case one of these things pop up.
[209:18.02]Why?
[209:18.34]Why are we getting hurt?
[209:21.00]I'm hurt.
[209:21.42]I shouldn't be hurt.
[209:22.60]Wait.
[209:36.86]Everybody hurts.
[209:42.65]Okay.
[209:43.13]Should I get some more of those?
[209:46.63]I feel like I might need... Wait.
[209:47.95]Do these count as minerals?
[209:52.29]No.
[209:57.80]Alright, we got... Am I pulling somebody out of here?
[210:00.08]I gotta go get... Yeah, we need eight.
[210:03.42]Let's close it up.
[210:19.26]the new guy unfortunately the new guy was randomly rolled to a different new guy and I don't have the materials alright we got a whole crew now and that one can swim get the big power from the river somebody should be big that's true
[210:58.08]Oh, fuck yeah.
[211:01.64]Look at all these crystals.
[211:10.34]Crystals.
[211:10.80]I need food.
[211:24.29]Oh, you got all those steaks.
[211:25.11]Eat them.
[211:25.31]You're just supposed to be a crystal person.
[211:33.58]I need to knock him down.
[211:50.74]Nobody else touch these, please.
[212:12.14]Who can jump?
[212:13.84]Somebody has, you have jumping.
[212:15.30]Come here.
[212:27.19]I don't think I can get the ones up there, but that's fine.
[212:29.65]This is funny.
[212:36.41]Okay.
[212:39.11]What is that?
[212:45.25]This is like a pumpkin.
[212:47.15]Shit, who's going to eat the pumpkin?
[212:48.66]Wait.
[212:50.30]New guy.
[212:50.52]This is for you.
[212:54.86]Oh, you're not even the new guy.
[212:56.02]Where's the new guy?
[212:56.70]Oh, you're over there.
[212:57.28]Sorry.
[212:58.86]I'm sorry.
[212:59.24]I'm sorry.
[212:59.60]I'm losing track.
[213:00.86]Here, you take this.
[213:19.45]Long distance water squirting?
[213:24.69]Oh my goodness, that's far.
[213:32.72]I mean, that's not, I mean, that's kind of, I guess it's kind of cool.
[213:38.46]I guess.
[213:40.82]Well, it was definitely, wait, it might be an egg.
[213:47.30]What is all this stuff?
[213:51.02]I feel like I should probably save some of these.
[213:52.68]Okay.
[213:55.14]Just save the rest of these because this looks like an interesting flower.
[214:00.65]Okay.
[214:15.74]Okay.
[214:18.25]Interesting.
[214:20.23]Oh.
[214:23.01]Wait.
[214:24.85]I need this to get whatever their name was.
[214:34.54]Now we got a full squad.
[214:38.36]We got a full squad.
[214:40.64]It's probably randomized again.
[214:41.78]We got a full squad.
[214:42.76]We got eight.
[214:45.44]Look at it.
[214:46.02]It's a full squad.
[214:50.42]Best way to go.
[214:54.95]Actually, I don't know.
[214:55.83]It's kind of far.
[214:59.17]Let me get a better view.
[215:04.95]We don't even need to be running around with a full squad either.
[215:07.95]It's just, I don't know.
[215:08.87]I feel like they have, they're friends.
[215:10.73]And I wouldn't want just two or three of them to be alone.
[215:13.33]Not cool.
[215:26.96]When we get these steaks.
[215:30.00]You.
[215:33.83]Alright, got plenty sticks.
[215:56.95]So the best way to go is... Okay, straight here, bang a left outside of the force field.
[216:04.51]Yeah, this is the right way to go.
[216:06.38]Let's move.
[216:06.76]Are they fighting?
[216:25.26]Alright, so then from here not go this way.
[216:27.88]It's wait.
[216:28.37]There might be something there.
[216:31.87]But a cave.
[216:33.89]So many things to look at.
[216:34.67]I don't know.
[216:36.53]If I go in there, I'm going to.
[216:37.67]Alright, we're just going to go.
[216:39.63]Eat some food.

[217:59.39]I don't want to do that.
[217:59.91]It might kill me.
[218:11.79]Oops.
[218:12.83]I want... Come here.

[219:53.98]Got it.
[219:55.19]Permanent mutation incoming.
[220:10.63]I need more distance.
[220:13.74]Here we go.
[220:14.22]This should do it.
[220:22.18]Really?
[220:22.38]Are you serious?
[220:48.15]Dude, how bad do you piss on the toilet seat?
[220:56.82]One time recently, I was so tired.
[221:00.80]I don't know what happened.
[221:02.80]But I'm usually pretty good about that.
[221:04.51]I'm usually very good about that.
[221:07.15]But I was, I must have been really tired, like just out of a dead sleep.
[221:11.05]And I think, dude, I just pissed, I think, all over this toilet.
[221:18.22]Because Holly said she went into the bathroom and walked out.
[221:22.98]She was like, nope.
[221:29.52]I definitely just pissed all over it too.
[221:31.52]It was so bad.
[221:32.38]What?
[221:35.59]That was a raid.
[221:39.13]Hey.
[221:40.25]Hey!
[221:41.55]What's going on?
[221:42.17]Welcome.
[221:42.35]Welcome.
[221:43.61]Thanks for the, uh, thanks for the raid.
[221:46.25]That was Honey Goblin.
[221:48.40]Thanks, Honey Goblin.
[221:50.14]Welcome, everybody.
[221:50.82]Hope you had a good stream.
[221:52.80]Pretty cool.
[221:53.42]We were talking about something very, very normal.
[221:56.74]Not anything strange.
[221:58.31]Promise.
[222:01.49]Yeah, we don't even need to, honestly, we don't even need to repeat what we were just talking about.
[222:05.59]This is unnecessary.
[222:11.02]Right?
[222:11.36]There's no reason to even bring it up ever again.
[222:13.47]How come this doesn't work?
[222:22.49]It needs to be like a concentrated P stream.
[222:27.49]Everybody do it.
[222:37.01]Oh, no, no.
[222:38.27]Whoops.
[222:38.69]It's alright.
[222:39.19]Who cares?
[222:44.13]yeah thanks for the ride welcome this is the eternal cylinder give you a quick uh recap of what's going on the point of the game is these little creatures they have different mutations you can do and there's a gigantic rolling pin that's uh crushing Earth I'm imagining we're on some kind of Earth let me do this permanent mutation real quick
[223:16.87]is it this one okay so this is I can make a mixer body alright so I can turn it on cool I well this I don't want to turn it on to everybody though
[223:49.38]Stop bumping into each other.
[223:50.32]Alright.
[223:54.26]What do you got for us?
[223:59.34]The projection from whoever you're controlling shared its wisdom with the Trebon and showed them how to protect it from the evil light of their enemies.
[224:13.08]Good thing I held on to that because this is greatly improves Trebon regenerative capabilities.
[224:18.92]Missing one object, some kind of brain.
[224:20.94]I think it's a brain.
[224:27.78]I'll track it for now.
[224:29.31]Alright.
[224:30.65]Decision time.
[224:33.63]Where's the jumper?
[224:34.21]Okay.
[224:52.66]I'm just getting these for the material collector.
[224:58.14]I know I'm going to spend like a half an hour doing this.
[225:01.06]It's alright.
[225:01.50]Just like, I don't know, wash a few dishes or something.
[225:06.46]You know that gross ass cup that's sitting on your fucking desk right now?
[225:09.89]The disgusting one that you peer in and it's just, wow, that's fucking gross.
[225:15.87]Just go right now while I'm doing this.
[225:17.25]Just go clean that cup.
[225:19.95]I know you all have one.
[225:21.21]Everybody has one.
[225:22.03]Everybody has one gross ass cup that's sitting there that's been there for probably a week and it's fucking filthy.
[225:26.73]Just do it now.
[225:28.60]Do it now while you have a minute.
[225:42.57]I don't use that cup.
[225:46.33]You drinking water with your hands?
[225:47.67]You drinking?
[225:48.19]What are you?
[225:48.93]Are you scooping it up?
[225:51.20]Out of a well with your hands?
[225:52.44]What are you talking about?
[225:53.16]Alright, that's enough crystals.
[225:59.75]No, it's not.
[226:00.29]It's never enough crystals.
[226:02.37]Are you serious?
[226:05.03]You don't think I'm going to get all those up there?
[226:07.99]I have to.
[226:10.41]If I don't get those crystals, I will disintegrate.
[226:13.26]I have to get them.
[226:28.21]Oh, fuck you.
[226:31.57]Not, you know, not you, but, you know, in general.
[226:34.23]Alright, that's good enough.
[226:54.14]That's good enough.
[226:54.94]That's good enough.
[226:56.14]That's good enough.
[226:58.95]Alright, let's give him to the crusher.
[227:01.19]It's almost full stacks of crystals.
[227:22.46]Health, um.
[227:26.39]Yeah.
[227:33.83]Stamina is fine.
[227:34.63]I need three.
[227:42.71]Didn't I already do that upgrade?
[227:45.21]Did I not do that upgrade?
[227:46.10]I thought I did it already.
[227:46.78]I got time.
[227:52.88]Alright.
[227:53.76]Maximum food.
[227:54.56]I'm going to do this next in about 10 seconds.
[228:04.45]I washed a cup.
[228:05.27]Good.
[228:13.00]Do leadership?
[228:14.00]I did leadership twice already.
[228:15.30]I feel like it's going to be way too expensive at this point.
[228:17.72]13.
[228:18.44]Yeah, no, we'll do that later.
[228:21.44]I got eight.
[228:25.48]Wait, spray it.
[228:26.44]Wait, I need three, you said.
[228:28.74]Well, there we go.
[228:29.52]One, two, three.
[228:31.76]Perfect.
[228:37.94]Refill the water and let's get out of here.
[228:45.00]Hey dude, can you please just say yippee?
[228:46.54]Yeah.
[228:48.28]Yippee!
[228:48.54]Is that what you wanted?
[228:52.72]I am satisfied with this.
[229:03.69]I do want to eat.
[229:05.21]Let's give... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[229:09.85]Guelvo!
[229:13.00]Come here, please.
[229:13.48]I'm going to cook us up.
[229:16.80]Why don't you fry us up some of those steaks?
[229:36.13]New York City.
[229:42.12]New York City.
[229:43.56]Alright, there's a hole over there though.
[229:53.41]Let's go in the hole.
[229:57.43]Wait.
[230:01.08]Never mind, go.
[230:18.76]Treasures lie in here for our Trebom friend.
[230:34.91]Oh OK, worth it.
[230:37.43]And there's a shitload of crystals down here.
[230:39.05]You know what I'm doing down here.
[230:40.01]Alright, who can somebody take this?
[230:44.31]You can take them both.
[230:50.98]full health that's a big deal alright I need uh where's my uh refinery I need you down here they're trying to do it through the wall they're trying they're helping
[231:25.49]Alright, you actually have to come down here, though, guys.
[231:27.25]Come on.
[231:39.18]Actually come down.
[231:39.90]There's so many big, thick crystals down here.
[231:51.88]You.
[231:52.74]Don't side-eye me like that.
[231:54.36]You, get down here.
[231:57.26]Get over here.
[231:57.84]Alright, get these.
[232:15.07]These things have a lot in them.
[232:26.59]Seven was like 15 down here.
[232:41.10]Maybe if you all got out of the way, I'd be able to do this faster.
[232:49.16]They get them all.
[232:52.35]One more.
[232:53.89]Two more.
[233:00.13]Camera, are you not helping?
[233:00.99]Okay.
[233:15.66]Cool.
[233:17.44]I'm rooting for the other team.
[233:19.44]You suck.
[233:24.53]Enjoy your ban.
[233:25.37]Hmm.
[233:28.96]Enjoy your band.

[233:56.28]See ya.
[234:05.05]Uh everybody in everybody back in everybody get back in back in back in everybody back in back in back in don't die, please I just spent like 10 minutes mining this fucking goddamn hole if one of you gets sucked up by the alien thing I'm gonna be so upset It says bye
[234:39.59]Oh, you probably giggle when Godzilla cries.
[234:41.52]No, wait, what?
[234:51.60]If you had to pick one of these creatures to be, which one would you be and why?
[234:54.14]Probably this one.
[234:59.96]I can just put rocks in my mouth and turn it into money in my bank account.
[235:04.19]That seems like a great thing to do.
[235:21.86]Alright, I got that.
[235:23.00]We just gotta go this way now.
[235:25.28]And yes, over here.
[235:30.08]Alright, let's move.
[235:30.68]I think we got everything we needed.
[235:38.04]Are we on food?
[235:38.72]I think we're fine.
[235:39.83]I just gotta, let's get it in the right spot.
[235:51.51]Hey, look at that.
[235:52.61]Perfect.
[236:00.00]This is a straight shot here.
[236:03.15]And go.
[236:25.97]Take a break.
[236:31.55]That was pretty uneventful.
[236:54.61]I feel good about that.
[237:06.12]You actually made it.
[237:07.50]Good for you.
[237:08.18]Wow.
[237:09.30]Actually did it.
[237:10.02]Yes.
[237:11.02]These were the crystals that the Trawala used as crowns.
[237:15.97]The Trebam wondered what secret powers they hid.
[237:18.91]Really?
[237:19.77]But there was little time to think about such things.
[237:22.37]As soon, the mathematician would make his terrible entrance.
[237:27.97]Where is the ingredient that would transform their skin into crystal?
[237:33.16]It had to be nearby.
[237:40.17]Let me just reset it.
[237:44.29]You like Oreos?
[237:44.95]I do.
[238:01.18]What's your dream Trebon Blunt rotation?
[238:03.14]We already talked about this.
[238:04.46]You want me to do it?
[238:05.02]Fine.
[238:12.09]This one.
[238:13.17]For sure.
[238:14.47]You want to talk us through some sick fucking fat rips this one could do?
[238:20.38]Okay.
[238:21.56]This one.
[238:22.66]How many can be there?
[238:30.76]Four?
[238:32.42]Including me?
[238:38.44]This one.
[238:42.08]I think that's just cool.
[238:45.60]You bet your ass that he's gonna walk on the wall and just stick there.
[238:48.39]And everyone's gonna go, Whoa!
[238:50.03]Yo!
[238:50.47]What the fuck?
[238:51.31]Okay.
[239:02.61]I mean, one of the cubes.
[239:04.77]I mean, your cube.
[239:06.43]That's just kind of... Don't you feel like this is a... I feel like this would be like a great... I don't know.
[239:13.49]Like just sitting there on the couch like just fuzzy cube.
[239:16.03]Just like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[239:22.48]It's a huge shadow right now.
[239:23.66]I don't know what it is.
[239:26.42]That was so ominous.
[239:29.34]What about me?
[239:32.08]I guess you could hit the blood man, I don't know.
[239:35.52]And the last one.
[239:36.28]You.
[239:40.70]Because I feel like.
[239:44.07]Can play some pretty sick music when we all wanted it, right?
[239:47.93]Everyone's sitting around rotation happens and then.
[239:56.41]Why is the audio still messed up?
[240:00.97]OK.
[240:04.15]I need to get... One of these crystals has to be... We need to get the... Right, skin.
[240:08.77]Okay.
[240:09.77]You.
[240:14.85]One of these?
[240:21.25]No?
[240:22.05]I think it is one of these.
[240:22.91]Do we need to break it or do something to it?
[240:36.78]Maybe I can process it?
[240:40.82]Maybe.
[240:41.08]Hold on.
[240:44.86]Can you do anything with that?
[240:48.85]I can't suck it in.
[240:52.09]Maybe I can burn it.
[240:54.31]Okay.
[241:10.30]it's on fire no it's not I don't know I actually might need to reset the whole game the audio is still kind of messed up for me is that just a me problem or are you can you like hear a lot of this stuff or is it half the audio gone
[241:40.15]It's normal?
[241:41.43]Why does it sound so weird for me?
[241:42.39]Oh, I think I figured it out.
[241:47.91]Okay, yeah, I'm good.
[241:52.21]Um... Well, I have to process the crystal somehow.
[242:04.42]Uh...
[242:06.04]Ow.
[242:06.18]What?
[242:06.30]Okay.
[242:06.58]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[242:08.04]Um... What do I... What do I do?
[242:35.33]That was a terrible enemy But in its rage it had revealed its weakness need to eat the crystal fragments It was igniting like a shooter back against it who's got the health the trebum would have to be nimble and make good use of their trunks But this was a challenge.
[242:54.80]They were fit for I
[243:04.03]God.
[243:04.59]Okay.
[243:05.05]Everyone move, move, move.
[243:05.93]Move out, move out, move out, move out.
[243:07.39]Far away, far away.
[243:08.97]Far away.
[243:17.81]Shoot it.
[243:19.11]Shoot it.
[243:20.48]Shoot him.
[243:21.86]I don't understand how to shoot him.
[243:25.04]I don't get it.
[243:40.66]There's no more crystals.
[243:46.21]Do they have to be glowing to hurt or no?
[243:52.13]I wish there was an aim so bad in this game.
[243:54.01]Like, shoot it out.
[243:55.03]I cannot shoot this.
[243:58.54]I don't understand what's going on.
[244:03.42]Okay.
[244:05.70]He's dead.
[244:10.83]Okay, that was, I swear to God, that was the most awkward thing I've ever done in my whole life.
[244:15.43]It's very awkward.
[245:04.25]I see I can't like get close and there it was the unifier this is weird man I'm saying clever and it's not a way of defeating this dreadful creature so they could claim the ingredient they needed to transform there's no aim you just have to shoot it in a direction hope it doesn't hit the ground
[245:41.46]No!
[245:41.78]Everybody run!
[245:49.31]Do it!
[246:00.95]Fuck you!
[246:01.73]Come on!
[246:14.82]Just don't be bad.
[246:15.81]I don't... Dude, the... You don't understand.
[246:22.19]It's weird.
[246:22.89]I have to get right in front of him.
[246:26.18]It slows the character down.
[246:27.86]And then I have to, like... I mean, it's very weird.
[246:32.18]It's very strange.
[246:33.42]You understand?
[246:47.19]at the high ground.
[246:47.85]I might just shoot it over his head.
[246:57.73]I liked my way better.
[246:59.57]I need more crystals.
[247:12.12]He needs to break them.
[247:29.52]Crystals!
[247:30.02]Swiss cheese!
[247:30.32]Who wants to eat the weird cheese?
[247:31.38]Who wants it?
[247:31.68]You.
[247:31.80]Nice blue cheese.
[248:03.38]It's kind of shiny.
[248:04.20]Alright.
[248:04.76]Who else are you?
[248:05.80]Oh.
[248:05.90]Crap.
[248:06.04]I mean, it's that right there.
[248:37.18]Did it work?
[248:41.00]Oh no.
[248:42.42]It's just you!
[248:43.17]I hope you're gonna be alright.
[248:59.16]Oh god.
[248:59.68]Uh, actually puke.
[249:00.92]Warning.
[249:03.21]Everyone needs to be aware of this.
[249:04.97]This world gets a little weird in mirrors.
[249:06.93]It actually is kind of pure conducive.
[249:08.32]Once again, the Trebom had returned to the strange place in the giant's dreams.
[249:15.12]There were more mysteries to uncover, more memories to take back.
[249:19.81]The voice seemed even stronger now.
[249:22.49]Yes, yes, I can almost speak.
[249:27.55]Let me tell you your story.
[249:32.46]The song of your people is rich and beautiful.
[249:36.94]Don't shoot those, bro.
[249:39.20]What did I just do?
[249:41.80]What did I just do?
[249:43.54]And so you learned to avoid repeating your mistakes.
[249:47.73]Slowly, you discovered the secrets of your world.
[249:50.79]Everyone's alive.
[249:51.69]You built great cities full of wonders.
[249:55.25]And then you sang to the stars to find others like you to share in the joys of existence.
[250:08.85]When you sang to the stars, there were many who heard you and raised their voices in song.
[250:17.58]Most are gone now, save for the Trawana, your oldest friends.
[250:23.76]When we heard your song, it was already too late for us.
[250:29.38]The cylinder was upon us, and there was nothing we could do.
[250:35.08]But we are not that different from you.
[250:38.87]We are also not strong or fast, and we don't have sharp teeth, but we are stubborn.
[250:48.68]The cylinder creates its minions from pieces of what it absorbs.
[250:53.82]So we found a way to help you.
[250:57.75]All of us together, these fragments of my people, the memories of your ancestors,
[251:05.34]And what's left of all those others who shared our fate?
[251:10.01]A conspiracy of ghosts to sabotage the cylinder and give you a chance.
[251:18.21]There is more to be found.
[251:20.62]Memories to be reclaimed.
[251:22.78]And what you need in order to... But our fragments are fading away.
[251:31.60]being absorbed these moments of strength are rare I am I am only but the voice could not continue once more it was only a memory
[252:12.35]Group piss break.
[252:20.68]Okay.
[252:23.74]Wacky.
[252:26.12]Interesting.
[252:29.23]A little scary.
[252:39.31]Where are we now?
[252:50.24]An ocean.
[252:50.58]Are we at the end of the world?
[253:07.32]What was this artificial island on the horizon?
[253:11.84]Could it be what the Trebham had been told to search for?
[253:15.98]We're good on food.
[253:16.42]Eat it.
[253:16.75]Water's cold.
[253:46.05]What the hell?
[253:51.25]So what's the web feed for then?
[253:57.86]Only one person has to have it, so let's go.
[254:03.72]Maybe the web, maybe it's stacked.
[254:05.50]Probably does stack.
[254:06.18]Alright, let's go.
[254:07.80]Are they going to get hurt from this?
[254:09.98]Whatever.
[254:17.19]Web heat makes you jump higher out of the water.
[254:18.67]This is really pretty.
[254:21.23]Looks really nice.
[254:26.27]They're all too cold.
[254:28.03]I'm going to save this.
[254:32.58]Is he a little dinosaur?
[254:33.46]He does look like a little dinosaur.
[254:53.11]Mmm, cube's not looking great.
[254:55.73]Come on.
[254:56.49]Come on, cube.
[254:57.05]Alright, I'm going to eat this.
[255:11.13]Please get out of the water.
[255:13.13]Please get out of the water.
[255:20.18]Ah, cube ain't going to make it.
[255:22.69]The cube is dead officially as of right now.
[255:29.92]Yeah, we're going to lose a couple people here.
[255:37.22]Eat another fish.
[255:40.47]Cube's dead.
[255:48.43]Oh, just barely.
[255:49.41]Alright, get out of here.
[255:54.35]Get up on the island.
[255:55.09]We're going to eat and regen.
[255:57.57]Please tell me everyone's out.
[256:00.75]2345678 OK, we're good.
[256:05.23]Alright, everybody relax region.
[256:12.48]Actually need some of these.
[256:14.56]Or a mutation.
[256:20.62]Get out of there.
[256:31.88]Okay, do that shit.
[256:36.62]Alright.
[256:42.44]So I need one inflatable body thing.
[256:44.46]I think somebody actually has one.
[256:57.47]You know what?
[256:59.13]Eat the swim thing too.
[257:01.21]Eat the fish.
[257:08.22]You're going way too far away from me.
[257:09.52]Oh, you piece of shit.
[257:12.06]It's okay.
[257:12.70]Everyone's still fine.
[257:42.01]Come on, we're good.
[258:01.91]Somebody else should take this, but I don't know.
[258:04.11]Maybe not.
[258:04.57]I think we're fine.
[258:10.87]You idiot.
[258:22.71]I just want to heal.
[258:32.69]Okay.
[258:34.33]Last bit here.
[258:45.96]What's that?
[258:46.42]Whatever.
[258:52.28]Alright.
[258:54.70]Tutmut the Elder.
[258:58.02]Oh, this is alive.
[259:05.43]Is this its face or is this its back?
[259:30.68]oh we're good the trebum were happy to find a friend resting on the island however they quickly realized he was not well the elder told him what a pleasant surprise to find a group of such brave little adventurers
[259:51.53]Oh, I'm glad to see your faces before my end.
[259:55.17]Oh, no.
[259:56.11]I'm sorry to tell you that this structure will not ascend on its own.
[260:01.49]I was hoping someone might bring the lenses that power this palace before the cylinder came, but as I can see, you do not know of what I speak, and this is simply not to be.
[260:14.82]But fear not.
[260:16.42]There are other palaces in the waters of this great desert.
[260:20.46]And resting in the golden dunes of these marvelous plains, you will find the hidden treasures that can awaken and lift to their majestic heights the Trebam palaces that were once the pride of our people.
[260:35.55]Swim over to the other side and seek the trawala that guards my brother's temple.
[260:41.92]He will explain what you must do.
[260:44.58]I wish you luck.
[260:46.32]Know that my spirit will dance and sing when you succeed where I have failed.
[260:52.65]Do we get that big?
[260:55.35]It's kind of remarkable.
[260:57.63]We get to be huge like this eventually.
[261:05.93]Well, don't worry.
[261:07.53]We'll do it.
[261:08.67]I'll make sure we... I'm the leader, so I'll make sure that I tell all these other chumps what we need to do.
[261:17.91]Come on, chumps.
[261:19.89]Follow me.
[261:23.51]Oh.
[261:31.50]Any three of them?
[261:40.34]Hmm, wait.
[261:45.02]This is interesting stuff.
[261:48.20]But you still have the like the weird moon cheese.
[261:50.12]Thought that was water.
[262:08.55]Would you eat a cheese that looked like that?
[262:09.65]I don't think I would.
[262:10.35]Maybe I actually don't.
[262:14.08]Maybe I would.
[262:16.00]Seems kind of good.
[262:22.42]OK.
[262:29.33]Well.
[262:31.83]I guess we have to get on this and.
[262:35.99]What's the plan here?
[262:37.07]We have to like blow it.
[262:49.93]Well, whatever.
[263:03.59]Just go, just go, just go, just go, just go, just go, just go.
[263:13.99]Wait, there's like a what is that?
[263:15.37]I don't know.
[263:16.82]It's something weird.
[263:18.12]What is this thing?
[263:31.79]Ooh.
[263:39.92]It's hot.
[263:42.98]We're kind of burning up here.
[263:45.54]It's gonna be kind of sad.
[263:57.14]You lucky, lucky bastard.
[263:59.90]Yeah.
[264:04.03]They dropped something.
[264:08.89]During the brightest hours of the day, the desert is too hot for Trebom.
[264:11.79]Unless they stay in the shade or get into the water, they will slowly lose health.
[264:17.47]Okay.
[264:17.81]So in the shade or water, it's probably this.
[264:21.78]The Trebom sensed that something was roaming the desert.
[264:26.14]something that did not belong there no doubt the eternal cylinder had once again sent forth its cruel servants perhaps it had taken notice of the trip up and was seeking to stop them from accomplishing their goals get in the shade everybody get in the shade um
[265:04.87]Eat this bug!
[265:05.35]I don't know what it does, just eat it.
[265:11.39]I can run faster?
[265:21.58]That's not what I'm really looking for, man.
[265:30.00]Oh, shit.
[265:34.49]Oh.
[265:42.56]Spray water.
[265:43.80]Let me get in the temple first.
[265:44.84]Wuto.
[265:51.18]There's shit all over this.
[265:58.09]I don't know what this does.
[265:59.17]Oh my god, it's a super crystal.
[266:01.61]Shit, I need to... No, we're all gonna die.
[266:04.13]Where, where, where, where, where?
[266:06.29]This is too stressful.
[266:12.56]Where's this temple?
[266:13.28]Get in it.
[266:24.95]Go, go, go, go.
[266:31.40]Everyone's fine?
[266:34.86]I wonder if I should break this.
[266:35.76]Okay, I broke it.
[266:39.46]I don't know what this does, but... Hmm.
[266:52.57]I don't know who to give this to.
[266:57.19]I like the legs.
[266:58.71]It's cool.
[267:03.99]Maybe the cube.
[267:04.67]Yeah, the cube's been kind of lackluster.
[267:07.87]Wait, we gotta figure out who we haven't been using and who gets the axe here.
[267:13.93]I feel like I haven't used you in a while.
[267:16.77]Floating head.
[267:18.30]I haven't used cube in a while.
[267:19.50]We haven't really needed the light.
[267:24.18]There's two cubes, but this is a jumping cube.
[267:27.08]I don't know if that matters.
[267:28.82]Alright, come here, regular cube.
[267:31.56]Yep, it's you.
[267:35.22]think that's the best way to do it here see what happens camouflage well that doesn't really help it's cool but it doesn't really help
[268:11.91]They would all need to have it.
[268:15.55]Unless I can get the permanent upgrade.
[268:30.80]Lots of crystals in here, but I really want to spend the time to get them all.
[268:42.18]Probably.
[268:44.08]Okay, there's some goofy shit in here.
[268:49.94]I don't know what this does.
[268:50.68]Let's find out.
[268:51.42]Okay.
[268:53.70]That's the spike one.
[268:55.94]This one is the shiny.
[269:04.70]And this is... Should I break it?
[269:13.23]I'm going to break this.
[269:21.72]Sure.
[269:22.00]Why not?
[269:30.41]Oh, it's the plated body.
[269:31.51]Doesn't resist heat.
[269:38.38]Okay.
[269:41.88]Food.
[269:43.18]I don't think I need water.
[269:44.08]Maybe it's health again.
[269:51.28]Health.
[269:53.86]Stamina wheel.
[269:55.56]I could do stamina wheel.
[270:03.70]Leader.
[270:05.98]Also possible.
[270:19.16]You're in the desert, you should do water.
[270:20.42]I didn't even think about that.
[270:22.26]That's probably a problem.
[270:23.08]Yeah, I'll do that.
[270:27.75]Uh, water's the next one, right?
[270:40.64]No, that's smart.
[270:41.12]I think I'll save the rest.
[270:53.60]It's time for some inventory management.
[270:54.94]Okay.
[271:09.47]Eat all the bullshit that I don't care about.
[271:11.15]This.
[271:16.84]I need some of these.
[271:17.80]I can't get rid of any of this.
[271:20.88]This is all just crap.
[271:22.14]Heard all of it.
[271:27.62]This is junk as well.
[271:32.55]Who has the heat management one?
[271:36.97]Huh?
[271:41.69]Oh, he does!
[271:43.29]Okay.
[271:46.39]I needed three of these, though, for the mutation.
[271:48.36]Hold on.
[271:54.53]Didn't I need to hold onto them though?
[271:57.18]Where is it?
[272:04.14]I need one.
[272:04.66]Okay.
[272:11.28]Um, uh, Gunu, I'm going to give it to you and then it should give it to everybody technically, right?
[272:30.07]It's not giving it to everybody.
[272:31.33]Because he already had it.
[272:47.03]That's just for the fire trunk.
[272:48.90]Well, it did say heat resistant.
[272:56.20]That's what the tooltip said.
[272:58.71]A gas-filled membrane that absorbs heat.
[273:02.59]Wait a minute.
[273:04.82]That absorbs heat.
[273:05.80]It doesn't mean you absorb heat if you eat it.
[273:09.60]Well, great.
[273:21.11]Where the hell is it?
[273:33.69]What is this menu scroll?
[273:35.26]There we go.
[273:37.66]It's because the mouse is on the screen.
[273:39.00]God damn it.
[273:50.73]I don't know.
[273:53.30]I don't think it does.
[273:59.55]I don't think we found that thing yet that I need, but I'm going to get out of here.
[274:05.24]Crystal.
[274:05.44]Camouflage.
[274:27.88]I think I just have to find it, but I feel like I'm going to be in trouble.
[274:37.25]Okay, well, everybody's got full health.
[274:40.47]We regenned.
[274:44.69]Cleaned up a couple inventories.
[274:46.35]Although, what about the spike head?
[274:47.59]Did somebody do that?
[275:00.14]Starting to get a... There's a lot of different mutations and I don't really know what one I should have on.
[275:08.93]I'm just going to hold on to stuff because that's all I do in games like this.
[275:13.33]I just hold it forever and I never use it.
[275:16.17]Look at all these fucking crystals.
[275:48.46]Alright, can't get them all.
[275:50.24]You know what?
[275:51.26]Fuck it.
[275:55.44]One more health.
[276:08.38]It is fuck it Friday after all.
[276:12.78]My tea is almost gone.
[276:13.76]I've been sipping it this whole time.
[276:15.50]It's not... Yeah, I'm good.
[276:23.69]Still hot.
[276:27.69]I think it is actually working on... No, it's not.
[276:33.22]Alright, where from here... These crystals, I'm going to suck them all up.
[276:40.00]Come on.

[277:53.27]Okay, I guess I gotta go.
[277:54.91]Oh, fuck.
[278:21.55]This is dumb.
[278:25.77]I'm losing time.
[278:46.46]Holy shit, that just saved everything.
[278:48.36]That just saved the whole entire thing.
[279:04.19]Too bad.

[280:06.79]Okay.
[280:29.90]Okay.
[280:36.76]And here we go.
[280:43.11]Not yet.
[280:43.45]Let me get right to the edge.
[280:51.77]And...
[281:06.03]actually fucking clean.
[281:07.83]Hey.
[281:10.68]Nice.
[281:38.30]It's still hot, though.
[281:40.74]Ah, water.
[281:42.48]Just chill in here for a little bit.
[281:52.38]Ah.
[281:54.31]Shit.
[281:54.57]Everybody alright?
[281:59.55]Don't.
[281:59.99]Just eat stuff in your inventory, please.
[282:02.31]That stuff is very needed.
[282:03.89]It's stuff for quests, and you ate it.
[282:05.33]What an idiot.
[282:15.03]What a dumbass.
[282:21.56]Still no map.
[282:23.58]I think I'm alright.
[282:24.88]Oh, there we go.
[282:25.58]Oh.
[282:35.12]Oh.
[282:41.25]I feel like I can do something with these.
[282:42.81]Can I spray these with water or something?
[282:44.25]Maybe I can blow them up.
[282:48.15]Doesn't it feel like I can do something with these?
[282:53.50]Please leave me alone.
[283:01.49]That did not deter it at all.
[283:04.65]Didn't deter it at all.
[283:06.39]Didn't deter it at all.
[283:08.71]And now we're down in the fucking depths.
[283:13.25]Oh, actually, this is kind of good.
[283:27.61]We can just suck it up.
[283:29.89]Nope.
[283:54.11]Why are you looking at me?
[283:56.13]Breath of the Wild?
[283:57.29]It kind of is like that, isn't it?
[283:59.07]Everybody get out of the way, that's a fucking bomb.
[284:00.85]I thought it was water or shit.
[284:01.61]Okay.
[284:28.04]No?
[284:34.39]Ah.
[284:36.79]Okay.
[284:39.49]Interesting.
[284:47.17]We're very hungry.
[285:02.24]Is this going to squish him?
[285:11.21]How is it?
[285:11.87]How are you doing it?
[285:12.80]I don't.
[285:39.09]Can we just roll it?
[285:45.90]Is this thing even important?
[286:00.51]Camo?
[286:01.57]I think the camo is only for enemies.
[286:05.67]There we go.
[286:11.89]This looks to be something new.
[286:16.21]Do not do that.
[286:18.94]Actually, you know, make some bombs with something else.
[286:21.62]Here, take something like meat.
[286:25.18]We still have a cube, so we're fine.
[286:26.38]Take these crystals and shit.
[286:33.22]What else can you turn into meat?
[286:35.74]Or a bomb.
[286:38.04]There, use this.
[286:41.78]I'm fucking I'm like chilled out right now.
[286:43.79]Who cares?
[286:51.05]I'm so chilled out right now.
[286:52.71]I think that's fine.
[286:57.47]Alright, so what does it do?
[287:10.34]I'm afraid for you to eat this because I want you to be the generator of crystals.
[287:16.76]Somebody's lacking.
[287:17.72]It's you.
[287:18.76]There.
[287:22.52]I know floating is cool, but we haven't needed to use it in like three hours.
[287:39.19]Camouflage.
[288:03.18]Hey, can I change my answer?
[288:04.58]No, no, I was going to, you know.
[288:07.80]Never mind.
[288:08.30]Okay.
[288:25.66]We want this one to exist because we want to walk up that.
[288:32.04]Okay, we'll quit screwing it up.
[288:41.22]Okay, nice and hearty.
[288:45.84]Oh, fucking three head.
[288:48.91]Oh, fucking three head, mate.
[288:54.91]I think about that all the time since last week.
[288:58.15]I really do.
[289:01.09]I'll just be in the shower.
[289:03.43]Just washing.
[289:05.19]I just start going.
[289:06.75]Oh, Left 4 Dead.
[289:07.77]I fucking love that game, mate.
[289:10.61]It's just like fucking Left 4 Dead.
[289:13.12]Fucking three hit.
[289:19.44]I think... I think you can reach that.
[289:25.94]Can you reach that?
[289:29.37]Oh, yep.
[289:31.29]New power incoming.
[289:38.18]Oh my god, we don't have any water.
[289:39.30]We're going to die.
[289:40.18]We're going to starve to thirst.
[289:41.26]Oh, we need water.
[289:43.22]Oh, I look like that.
[289:44.02]Oh.
[289:59.90]Dude, how can you not hit that?
[290:09.22]It's right there.
[290:24.64]I can't aim higher than this.
[290:29.45]Hold on.
[290:36.56]Load over there.
[290:40.42]Ow.
[290:40.88]Oh, I see.
[290:41.40]I have to move with the cutout.
[291:10.74]Let's go!
[291:11.14]Can you do the Minecraft villager hum noise?
[291:20.01]Is that close?
[291:33.49]I feel like that was pretty close.
[291:39.64]Huh.
[291:41.48]Huh.
[291:41.98]Huh.
[291:45.50]Map.
[291:48.22]It's too fast.
[291:55.00]And the Trebom, these curious little shits, figured out that the map is leading them to the serpent far away in the oasis.
[292:08.05]Will they be able to reach it in time?
[292:15.63]Okay.
[292:17.26]I can leave.
[292:17.66]I do need water, though.
[292:25.74]Oh, I need my smoker.
[292:28.66]Okay.
[292:48.13]Ooh.
[292:50.10]Oh, dude, look at how many crystals are back here.
[292:58.58]You know what to do.
[293:06.11]Suck them up.
[293:11.54]And water, thank God.
[293:26.40]Nice.
[293:27.96]Alright.
[293:31.45]No, I don't want you to do that.
[293:32.83]This should give me probably three or four crystals.
[293:44.55]I am excited.
[293:45.25]So we're gonna have to wait here for a minute.
[293:54.07]It's getting kind of late.
[293:56.13]Might call it here soon.
[293:58.17]Maybe at the next checkpoint.
[294:05.74]Yo, I'm telling you, I've been loving these, like, after six o'clock, just kind of nighttime streams.
[294:17.17]I love it.
[294:21.01]I wonder how much is left.
[294:23.22]From over another few hours, maybe?
[294:34.78]You should finish it tonight.
[294:39.60]I don't know.
[294:40.94]We'll see what happens when I get to the next checkpoint.
[294:47.61]Something to look forward to after work?
[294:57.90]Okay, I can leave at this point.
[295:00.18]Got everything.
[295:00.74]This buddy is going to be churning out crystals.
[295:09.20]That's fantastic.
[295:10.72]Alright, let's get to the next tower.
[295:30.01]There's a decent chunk left.
[295:30.85]This is the area which you just started in a whole nother area.
[295:33.33]I imagine it's probably another few hours.
[295:36.13]It's probably three or four hours.
[295:42.84]I'll finish it up.
[295:43.34]Don't worry.
[295:44.78]Alright.
[295:46.52]I got the map.
[295:48.36]Weirdly enough, there is no tower.
[295:50.58]So that's kind of scary.
[295:52.32]Wait, maybe there's one over here.
[296:05.56]Did I go down this hole?
[296:06.38]I don't remember.
[296:06.84]I was kind of panicking.
[296:09.88]I don't think I went down this hole.
[296:13.08]I didn't have it revealed.
[296:13.84]No, I definitely didn't.
[296:27.49]There it is.
[296:35.61]At least another few hours.
[296:38.53]Yeah, that's all good.
[296:39.21]Alright, I'll finish it.
[296:41.95]I got a lot of crystals.
[297:01.48]Okay.
[297:16.44]That's a scary thing happening and I don't know what's going on, but they're not still up there, right?
[297:20.90]No.
[297:21.10]I don't think it doesn't count unless I can see them.
[297:26.84]Alright.
[297:34.86]Nice.
[297:41.82]It's a long game.
[297:44.18]I don't think it's a long game.
[297:45.84]I think it's just 12 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours.
[297:49.38]Alright, there it is.
[298:05.73]Cool.
[298:06.43]I'm going to have like 25 crystals.
[298:08.61]We need to find one of those things.
[298:14.16]Alright, I think I just have to go.
[298:17.06]Wait, we need to eat.
[298:20.14]Anybody have any food?
[298:20.74]Kinda, but I don't want to get rid of those.
[298:25.20]Alright, where's Grappo?
[298:30.96]Where's Grappo?
[298:31.54]Alright, Grappo, you need to feed us.
[298:39.03]Oh, there are steaks here.
[298:54.16]I want full stomach.
[298:58.66]Full water.
[299:02.08]Oh, I don't want to cross there.
[299:03.24]No, no, no, this way.
[299:08.50]You need to feed yourself.
[299:09.86]I'll be good.
[299:10.34]I think Holly was talking about making curry tonight, so that's going to be fog champ.
[299:28.99]I love curry.
[299:30.01]It's so good.
[299:32.35]So easy.
[299:34.81]Get a fucking onion.
[299:36.95]Potatoes.
[299:38.17]Carrots.
[299:39.25]Mix in that shit.
[299:40.22]Oh, it's so good.
[299:44.26]It's such like a nice, filling, hearty dinner.
[299:51.00]With rice too.
[299:54.62]Curry at 11 p.m.?
[299:57.87]What's wrong with that?
[300:02.45]What the fuck?
[300:04.17]Holy shit, that was terrifying.
[300:06.45]That was actually terrifying.
[300:10.41]Um, okay.
[300:11.31]Well, that exists.
[300:12.67]Oh, that just happened.
[300:15.29]I'm sorry.
[300:17.41]Okay, don't fuck around.
[300:18.42]I gotta go now.
[300:19.28]What am I doing?
[300:22.50]Get up!
[300:24.10]No!
[300:25.14]No!
[300:26.28]Acid!
[300:30.96]Please!
[300:31.80]Please!
[300:36.20]Oh!
[300:37.04]Did we get through?
[300:40.59]No!
[300:41.25]LeeWom is dead.
[300:47.62]Seeing the celestial trawalla, the Trebom were reminded of all the many creatures that had fallen before the cylinder.
[300:56.99]Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his sibling's fate, and the Trebom had to wait of the bad news they carried.
[301:09.17]Oh no.
[301:26.40]Somebody else is fucking dead.
[301:27.62]Hold on a second, guys.
[301:29.08]We're going back.
[301:35.82]I know I'm playing... I know.
[301:37.99]This is supposed to be like a roguelike kind of game in a way.
[301:42.73]I know.
[301:43.33]I know.
[301:43.59]Trust me.
[301:44.39]I know.
[301:45.15]I know.
[301:45.51]We're supposed to be losing people and getting more and... I know.
[301:51.32]But I don't... I like... I like this team.
[301:53.90]They're staying.
[301:54.88]Even if I have to save some...
[301:59.24]Alright, here we go.
[302:15.89]Just don't get startled by the weird thing over here on the left.
[302:35.29]Let's wait.
[302:36.37]Let's wait.
[302:51.97]Oh.
[302:58.82]This is dangerous shit.
[303:07.99]Okay.
[303:09.21]That's better.
[303:09.81]Everybody's safe.
[303:16.20]Jeez.
[303:17.52]Stop looking back.
[303:18.42]I have to because what if it's... Is that an egg?
[303:25.55]Always a straggler.
[303:26.69]It's always you.
[303:28.09]It's always we, mom.
[303:32.21]Seeing the Celestial Triwala, the Trebom were reminded of all the many creatures that had fallen before the Celestial Triwala.
[303:40.33]Please leave us alone.
[303:41.57]Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his sibling's fate, and the Trebom felt the weight of the bad news they carried.
[303:54.45]We will fight.
[304:01.99]No, I need that.
[304:02.90]I need that.
[304:03.74]I want that.
[304:04.26]I need that.
[304:04.70]Okay, everybody relax.
[304:09.48]We're good.
[304:13.82]Alright.
[304:16.20]Yeah, I think it's a good place to call it.
[304:18.41]Probably got another three or four hours.
[304:20.19]We'll finish it up on... What's today?
[304:23.05]Today's Friday.
[304:24.05]Technically Saturday.
[304:25.21]How about Sunday?
[304:27.07]Sunday night?
[304:31.52]Sunday night Sunday night Sunday night yeah well these things hurt I was stop walking into him what are you dumb stop you just watched me do it I like this area I like the desert a lot
[304:56.54]Sunday is technically tomorrow.
[304:58.92]Yeah, okay.
[304:59.92]So if you're Eastern or if you're EU or it might even be Sunday already for some of the Australia crowd.
[305:07.05]Yeah, I mean Sunday Pacific at 6 p.m.
[305:20.06]Yeah, I'll be really... I gotta be really upfront with everybody.
[305:24.86]I love this.
[305:26.67]This is just so nice.
[305:27.53]Kind of reminds me of, you know, where it all started.
[305:35.19]I've been really enjoying these.
[305:44.08]The old days.
[305:48.48]Thank you for being honest.
[305:49.46]I gotta be honest.
[305:50.56]I love this.
[305:52.66]Yeah.
[305:54.36]Don't want to go too too late.
[305:55.98]Thanks for watching everybody.
[305:57.28]We will conclude the Eternal Cylinder on Sunday evening.
[305:59.90]Which is just about a day and some change from now.
[306:04.57]We'll see you soon.
[306:10.01]Night streamer Andy.
[306:15.95]I'm very curious of the conclusion.
[306:22.10]We'll see you on Sunday.
[306:24.53]I'm going to go eat.
[306:26.75]See you in a day.
[306:32.06]And yeah.
[306:34.86]Let's go to the other screen.
[306:44.02]Appreciate you sticking around.
[306:44.90]I know this kind of new change of schedule is going to change your pace.
[306:51.76]Appreciate you hanging out though.
[306:59.62]Tea bags are out.
[307:00.38]Tea bags are right here.
[307:09.67]You eat hamburger helper on the toilet.
[307:13.86]I can't think of anything worse to eat on the toilet.
[307:19.52]That sounds like the worst possible food option for when you're in the bathroom.
[307:26.63]Maybe tacos would be second.
[307:30.67]I mean, maybe tacos would be worth.
[307:35.19]Well, it depends if it's like a taco or a burrito.
[307:37.47]Burrito would be fine.
[307:39.25]Why am I even answering this question that you just asked?
[307:43.66]Like this is a real question that I have to ask.
[307:45.72]I have to answer.
[307:47.70]There's no reason to answer this question.
[307:49.20]I could have just let it roll by in the chat.
[307:52.92]It would have just been gone.
[307:55.95]Here we are.
[308:07.84]You have a strange attraction to very weird comments.
[308:12.38]It's fun to read.
[308:13.74]The goofy stuff.
[308:14.72]I like it.
[308:24.65]Yeah, have a good night.
[308:28.93]Oh, and by the way, it'll probably only take three and a half or so hours, three to four hours to do the rest.
[308:36.87]So maybe we'll start something else on Sunday.
[308:47.24]Or maybe we'll do more Breath of the Wild or Frog Detective.
[308:51.92]I keep seeing Pizza Tower.
[308:54.60]Maybe I'll do Pizza Tower.
[308:57.63]I have to finish Breath of the Wild though.
[309:01.57]The new Hitman stuff.
[309:02.55]Yep.
[309:03.03]Hitman freelance mode.
[309:04.75]Seems crazy.
[309:07.11]Yeah, we got.
[309:07.49]There's a lot of options.
[309:08.21]There's a lot to do.
[309:12.72]But I'll see you guys later.
[309:13.58]See you Sunday.
[309:15.40]Thanks for watching.

[309:25.25]See you soon.
[309:49.62]Manual volume decrease, Andy.
[309:53.29]I think about that person every time I do that.
