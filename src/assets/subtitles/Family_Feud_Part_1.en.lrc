[04:05.80]And, in fact, let's go take a look at it.
[04:09.16]Oh, you can see, like, speakers.
[04:10.92]Let me move that out of the way.
[04:17.69]Why?
[04:18.57]Why did I?
[04:19.09]I don't even like, oh fuck, I don't even know like the controls.

[04:41.52]My internet's fucking dying.
[04:43.51]My internet's dying right now.
[04:44.83]Are you fucking shitting me?
[04:48.23]Not even kidding, I just dropped like 300 frames.
[04:52.60]Oh, don't even fucking tell me.
[04:54.80]I just pressed the fucking button.
[04:57.48]I'm dropping frames all over the place.
[04:58.92]Can it handle Family Feud?
[05:01.91]What the fuck?
[05:04.29]Are you shitting me right now?
[05:10.13]Alright, you gotta tell me my internet can fucking handle Family Feud.
[05:14.28]When did this come from?
[05:20.21]Okay.
[05:22.93]I mean, it's still alright, I think.
[05:25.92]I'm dropping frames, but I don't fucking understand.
[05:32.08]That's, uh... That's unfortunate.
[05:36.99]Maybe it's just like a little hiccup, because my stream's still live.
[05:39.69]Alright, well, my internet's all fucked up, but I think it's okay.
[05:46.78]Let's go.
[05:50.58]I need to like... Let me just make sure this is going to work.
[05:55.90]Let me just run something.
[05:56.84]I'll be right back, guys, because I am dropping more frames now.
[05:59.97]Give me one second.
[06:00.61]I'll be right back.
[06:02.11]Don't go anywhere.
[06:02.69]Don't go anywhere.

[06:46.47]Yeah.
[07:22.34]Hmm.
[07:24.06]Okay, I think it's okay.
[07:27.32]I think it's okay.
[07:31.06]From my understanding of what this looks like, it looks like it's going to be alright.
[07:35.95]I hope so.
[07:36.39]I haven't dropped any frames yet.
[07:38.37]That was really weird.
[07:41.14]Well, let me know if it happens again, guys, because I'm trying to monitor it.
[07:43.98]But, alright, let's go.

[08:03.97]Hold on.
[08:06.01]No, not the Burt.
[08:06.71]I don't want to be the Burt's.
[08:09.44]Okay, we're the Burt's.
[08:09.98]Looks like we're gonna- looks like we're gonna be the Burt's!

[08:58.23]That's the easiest one.
[08:59.83]Kids love to go on like the pony ride.
[09:01.21]No, no, no.
[09:01.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:03.47]Yeah, pony.

[12:47.67]Egghead?
[12:49.37]Oh fuck, this is 1996.
[12:50.97]Of course it's gonna be Egghead.
[12:54.07]Fucking hell.
[12:57.35]These are 90s references.
[12:58.57]They're gonna pass it to me.
[12:59.57]Shit.
[13:01.81]Hold on.
[13:03.47]Think of some 90s terms here.
[13:06.17]There's so many of these.
[13:08.31]Egghead.
[13:08.75]Oh my god.
[13:13.60]Like, nerd?
[13:14.75]I don't know.
[13:15.29]It's not the smartest kid egghead.
[13:18.41]I'm gonna go with, like, I'm just gonna go with nerd.

[13:30.27]Doofus?
[13:33.27]Uh... Dweeb.
[13:39.28]Should I put down studious?
[13:40.90]Do you think it would be studious?
[13:44.65]How about studious?
[13:47.39]No, I'm gonna fuck this up.
[13:50.42]What's the number, what the fuck would the number one answer be?
[13:52.08]Goofy?
[13:54.12]Four eyes, that's a good one.
[13:55.28]Like four eyes, right?
[13:57.22]No, but that just means he has glasses on.
[13:58.66]Doesn't mean he's fucking smart.
[14:01.50]F, no, not F-P-T.
[14:05.46]Maybe like, yeah, like Einstein?
[14:06.68]Why should we spell this wrong?
[14:11.21]Wait, what?
[14:14.23]Like, Einstein.
[14:19.20]No, not Einstein, apparently.
[14:25.26]Like, Brainiac.
[14:27.02]That's a good one.
[14:27.58]Brainiac.
[14:27.96]These are going to be the dumbest fucking answers I can already tell.
[14:36.25]Brainiac.
[14:40.47]Number one answer.
[14:41.81]But how am I going to get six more of these?
[14:44.33]I don't even have any answer.
[14:53.27]I'm going to have to say no guess.
[14:56.53]The only other thing I can think of is like a geek.
[15:02.71]No, they're not going to get it either.
[15:04.35]The computer's not going to fucking even know what to do.
[15:07.59]Wait, what?
[15:12.18]Boo.
[15:13.74]Oh, bookworm.
[15:18.57]That's not fair.
[15:19.27]It was programmed into their fucking language.
[15:21.77]Oh, god damn it.
[15:26.47]Teacher's Pet, Smarty Pants, Know It All, Brown Noser.
[15:31.83]Oh, okay.
[15:33.39]I would have never fucking got any of those.
[15:36.21]Give me a goddamn break, video game.
[15:39.89]Give me a break.
[15:42.31]Alright, let's go.
[15:43.63]Next thing.
[15:48.15]Zero points.
[15:49.33]Didn't I win like 15,000 fucking dollars?
[15:58.06]Yeah, the Dunnigan family sure is doing well.
[15:59.94]Alright, out of the 100 people surveyed, top six answers are on the board.
[16:02.30]Name a job you can't believe they can't find anyone to do.
[16:08.94]What does that mean?
[16:09.54]Name a job you can't believe they can't find anyone to do.
[16:13.44]Does that mean nobody does this job?
[16:19.35]Why did I hit the buzzer?
[16:20.37]I don't even know what this is asking me.
[16:22.05]What question is this asking me?
[16:26.63]Streamer.
[16:28.84]They can't... You can't believe... A trash man?
[16:35.14]I don't even fucking know what it wants me to do.
[16:38.60]I'm going to say trash man.
[16:40.82]Is that what it's asking me?
[16:41.90]Eight seconds.
[16:47.81]Fuck.
[16:49.53]I didn't get it right.
[16:59.35]I got it.
[17:00.15]Trash man, number one answer.
[17:02.79]Alright, pass it.
[17:03.71]I don't wanna, I'm not doing this shit.
[17:06.83]Name a job you can't believe they can't find anyone to do.
[17:12.19]Janitor.
[17:14.16]Right.
[17:18.02]Yeah, good luck.
[17:18.94]Good luck getting the other four answers, computer.
[17:20.94]Ain't gonna happen.
[17:24.34]Yep.
[17:26.88]Sewer?
[17:29.12]Sewer?
[17:32.22]What do you mean, sewer?
[17:35.24]Sewer worker?
[17:36.12]Waste management?
[17:37.14]Waste development?
[17:37.96]Like, what do you mean sewer?
[17:38.86]What the fuck does that mean?
[17:39.72]Good!
[17:40.12]We got a no guess.
[17:41.00]We got a no guess here, guys.
[17:43.18]We're gonna be fine.
[17:45.90]We got a no guess.
[17:49.76]We're gonna get another no guess.
[17:52.69]Which wind window washer?
[18:01.19]That has to be one.
[18:02.01]It's so stupidly specific.
[18:03.66]Yeah.
[18:03.92]And like, this is 1996.
[18:04.54]People, there's an automatic window cleaner now.
[18:07.38]You understand?
[18:10.92]No.
[18:13.76]No guess.
[18:14.18]Alright.
[18:14.60]We're good.
[18:15.56]We just got to have one more dumb motherfucker write that.
[18:17.87]And we're good.
[18:18.33]Alright.
[18:21.53]Come on.
[18:24.36]Mmm... More... Mortician?
[18:33.14]Man, I can't believe nobody wants to be a sewer these days.
[18:35.92]Don't get this last one.
[18:37.26]Give me another no guess and let me take it.
[18:44.40]Zoo... Zoo... Zoo... Zoo cleaner?
[18:51.33]That is so fucking vague.
[18:55.10]What?
[18:56.62]What?
[19:03.11]Oh, it's just a zoo cleaner.
[19:04.79]That's not even a real job name.
[19:08.87]That many people wrote that?
[19:09.99]A fucking zoo cleaner?
[19:14.03]That's such bullshit.
[19:20.69]Okay, I really gotta...
[19:24.90]Yeah, but it's a janitor.
[19:26.21]A zoo cleaner is a janitor.
[19:28.57]That's just a fucking zoo janitor.
[19:30.61]That's not fair.
[19:32.71]Name any Civil War general of self.
[19:34.15]Ulysses Hasbray.
[19:42.92]What is it?
[19:43.96]Ulysses?
[19:44.78]How do you spell it?
[19:46.94]I gotta look this up right now.
[19:49.49]How do I look?
[19:50.21]I'm just gonna type it into Google right now.
[19:51.55]You guys are gonna be too far behind.
[19:56.46]Ulysses.
[19:58.11]U-L-Y?
[20:03.35]Y?
[20:05.21]S-S-E-S.
[20:19.74]That wasn't even close.
[20:21.61]That shit wasn't even close.
[20:23.83]That shit wasn't even close.
[20:27.35]Who else was a general?
[20:28.93]Who else was a general?
[20:34.58]I think I'm going to pass this shit.
[20:37.06]Should I pass this or should I play it?
[20:38.78]I don't know.
[20:40.32]I'm not sure.
[20:42.66]Do I know any other generals?
[20:43.88]I don't.
[20:44.32]Well, now we can do Ulysses again.
[20:46.11]We're going to play it.
[20:50.01]Do type it again.
[20:56.20]Ulysses.
[21:05.35]What?
[21:10.58]I don't understand.
[21:11.40]I'm having trouble understanding this.
[21:20.93]You fucking asshole game.

[86:17.91]And that's over.
[86:18.85]I lose.
[86:20.63]I thought there was going to be like two answers that were just so stupidly fucking specific.

[86:30.07]Water is blue.
[86:31.23]That's what I mean.
[86:31.77]Like what I've written.
[86:33.13]I don't think I would have written water.

[124:03.00]How did I lose that? I got it with sweater - pulled it in tight.
[124:07.00]That was a huge victory and socket apparently is not electrical outlet.
[124:14.59]It's a bunch of bullshit, man.
[124:21.03]I love that you can still hear, like, the music playing.
[124:26.56]Yeah, alright.
