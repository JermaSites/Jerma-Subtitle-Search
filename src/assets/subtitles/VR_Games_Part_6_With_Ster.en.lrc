[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.25]Yeah, sorry guys, we're having a little tech talk.
[00:07.43]T-E-C-H.
[00:10.59]Star's trying to figure out some tech.
[00:12.69]He's trying to figure out how to, like, get his tech working.
[00:16.03]And, uh, spoiler for everybody here, didn't get the tease, his tech is still not in a good functioning state, unfortunately.
[00:21.53]Put this up here.
[00:26.49]Uh, but, no, wait, wait, wait, it's not over.
[00:28.03]It's not, the stream is not over.
[00:29.21]We just started.
[00:33.12]Hey, there we are.
[00:36.17]Hi guys.
[00:38.37]Uh, this time I'm back here with Star, who is in fact streaming today.
[00:43.75]From what I understand.
[00:46.36]From what I've been told.
[00:48.10]Uh, we're gonna jump right in to pick up where we left off yesterday.
[00:52.66]Unless, uh, unless he's got anything to say.
[00:59.83]Um, everything I'm going to say is a technical problem.
[01:05.86]So I'm just going to let everyone know.
[01:09.58]Yep.
[01:11.96]I don't care and I'm ignoring them all.
[01:14.18]Oh.
[01:15.38]I mean, I'm just telling you, I've had my little headset handbag in my hands here.
[01:20.04]I've been sitting here waiting for you.
[01:21.84]I'm ready.
[01:22.72]How do we join up in game?
[01:24.78]Oh, my controller's run out of batteries.
[01:26.22]See you tomorrow.
[01:28.61]See you in 40 minutes.
[01:30.09]I have no idea.
[01:31.05]So, hold on, let's like, let's get in.
[01:33.74]Are you like, are you ready to go in?
[01:36.04]I'm ready to go in.
[01:37.04]Hold on, let me close this shit.
[01:47.30]Sorry, we're a little late.
[01:49.02]You know what's great about not using a webcam is you just, I'm nude.
[01:55.96]No one's gonna know.
[01:56.78]Wait, how do you not do a VR stream without a webcam?
[01:59.68]You gotta have like the people watching you do like the funny movements!
[02:03.77]Do you want me to, do you want to wait another 20 minutes?
[02:05.97]No.
[02:07.43]No!
[02:07.63]No, alright, I'm going in.
[02:13.82]The first thing, this is called, uh, Clash of, is this Clash of Chefs?
[02:19.88]I don't know.
[02:20.54]It's a game where we have to compete and cook food together and just hold on.
[02:24.20]Against each other, not together.
[02:26.62]Wait, this is not a together game?
[02:27.94]This is an against game?
[02:29.06]This is not a together game.
[02:30.76]Really?
[02:32.74]I think we're on opposite sides of the room and we're trying to cook the things faster.
[02:37.22]Your shirt is too small.
[02:38.12]And we can like roast up at each other.
[02:41.94]You want to wait another 20 minutes while I go get another shirt?
[02:45.43]No, the dryer.
[02:47.53]That's the advantage right there.
[02:50.22]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:51.62]Wait, is this the right hand?
[02:52.76]Yeah, it is.
[02:55.98]Guys, something you gotta know about buying shirts.
[02:58.60]I learned this firsthand with this one.
[03:01.56]First of all, if you buy a medium, it's gonna turn into a small.
[03:04.70]And don't leave it in the dryer for too long.
[03:10.06]I like this shirt, okay?
[03:12.27]It has to be form factor.
[03:14.83]So my perspiration doesn't get stuck in there.
[03:20.95]Whatever, I don't give a shit.
[03:22.77]You can make fun of my, like, baby shirt all you want.
[03:28.19]Just wait till you see me cook up a fucking couple of dogs here.
[03:30.99]Alright.
[03:36.12]This music's gonna drive me insane, I can already tell you that.
[03:41.72]Are you in my game?
[03:42.94]No.
[03:44.11]Uh, no.
[03:45.04]Hold on.
[03:45.68]I'm going in.
[03:46.88]So how do we do this?
[03:48.58]I'm going in.
[03:50.74]Why does this... Is this game this frame rating?
[03:54.22]That's what I said.
[03:55.94]Do you have the window on your desktop?
[03:58.54]No.
[03:59.14]Did you close it or did you minimize it?
[04:01.75]I didn't minimize it.
[04:02.59]I dragged it to almost non-existent.
[04:05.73]So I minimized it.
[04:07.07]Yeah.
[04:07.67]Open it up and shrink it.
[04:09.41]And then my game
[04:16.94]Shrink it to like barely existence and then move it off the screen That sounds that's very oddly specific how that is did you minimize it after that?
[04:29.95]I think it's just the game.
[04:34.63]We'll get it and see what happens
[04:45.15]Because my CPU is at, like, 11%, so... My CPU is better than your CPU.
[04:50.09]Actually, no, that helped a lot, actually.
[04:51.90]No, that, like, that fixed it for me.
[04:54.74]Yeah, dropping that, yeah, we're good.
[04:56.68]We're good, let's go.
[04:57.38]Alright, menu.
[05:00.48]Multiplayer.
[05:03.44]Uh, play online.
[05:04.60]Invite?
[05:05.14]You want to just invite me?
[05:07.94]Or should I just invite you?
[05:11.47]Uh, you want none of these people.
[05:14.53]Oh, no.
[05:15.35]You want to invite me?
[05:17.47]Uh, what do we do?
[05:18.27]We click the menu.
[05:19.51]I'm way behind.
[05:20.25]We'll play.
[05:21.27]Menu, and then play.
[05:23.37]Invite.

[05:34.38]Who is it?

[06:23.84]It's taken over my... I don't want to open up a mobile hotspot.
[06:27.48]Oh my god.
[06:28.18]Doesn't matter.

[07:34.92]I'm not even this tall for the counter!
[07:37.86]Who is that?
[07:38.36]Is that us?
[07:40.86]No.
[07:42.09]We just determined who us was.
[07:44.13]No, I'm talking about like, is this a surveillance camera of what we were doing?
[07:47.24]That's me.
[07:48.56]You can see what I'm doing.
[07:49.58]Dude, we're getting orders.
[07:53.24]We are?
[07:53.56]Yeah.
[07:54.84]What do you want?
[07:57.06]Are we getting, are you sure we're getting orders?
[07:59.32]Oh, fuck, we are getting orders.
[08:00.46]How do you play?
[08:01.22]Alright, he wants, he wants a cup of mustard and he wants a burger with... Are these workers or are these customers?
[08:08.72]Why are they dressed like workers?
[08:11.27]Well, those are crustaceans.
[08:12.17]Alright.
[08:12.41]Oh, he's work- what?
[08:13.01]These are- these are pre-sliced?
[08:14.67]Who does that?
[08:15.79]Okay, good.
[08:16.43]Uh, buns.
[08:16.91]Buns.
[08:17.59]How many of them?
[08:18.11]Two patties?
[08:19.93]Oh, I- you don't use your bare hand.
[08:22.88]Um, um, where's my spatula?
[08:25.36]Cheese.
[08:25.78]Cheese.
[08:26.32]Oh, he's fucking dumb.
[08:27.62]Here.
[08:27.82]A little squeeze of aioli.
[08:33.94]Okay.
[08:36.90]That's- that- that doesn't take very long at all.
[08:38.76]Where's the trash?
[08:47.37]That just grew.
[08:48.75]Is there trash?
[08:51.21]There's gonna be a fire.
[08:52.21]Alright, hold on.
[08:56.42]Alright, these take two seconds.
[08:58.40]Alright, we got cheese, two buns.
[09:22.97]Where's the aioli?
[09:23.57]Why did we just, like... Where's the aioli?
[09:26.43]How do burgers burn this fast?
[09:28.27]Here's the aioli.
[09:31.67]It's already gone.
[09:32.95]No, this one's easy.
[09:33.73]Shake this off.
[09:34.45]I can do that one right now.
[09:35.89]Just, like, burn it off.
[09:39.34]Okay.
[09:39.72]I thought it was gonna be done.
[09:48.76]Knife.
[09:53.42]We should have done that.
[09:54.16]No, we shouldn't have.
[09:54.82]Tutorials are for fucking dumb casual gamers.
[10:00.40]No, I gotta toast these buns.
[10:01.46]Just get rid of them.
[10:02.22]Where's the trash?
[10:11.12]What are you doing over there?
[10:11.84]Okay, you're actually playing.
[10:13.76]They're all lagging.
[10:14.80]I just need, I just need fresh hamburgers.
[10:18.33]Buns.
[10:21.36]Wait, do you only have to cook one side?
[10:23.80]I'm not agreeing with the physics.
[10:26.06]Okay, how do I pick this up without it fucking dropping?
[10:33.75]I did that one.
[10:36.53]I did that one.
[10:38.43]Take it!
[10:40.13]Hey!
[10:44.36]Gotta season the grill.
[10:48.26]What is in here?
[10:55.49]How did it go through?
[10:57.15]How did it go through the grape?
[11:00.28]Something in it is burning.
[11:01.70]I don't even know what that is.
[11:04.56]Will you come get this burger?
[11:06.82]They keep just switching them!
[11:09.14]Right here, I got one right here for you.
[11:12.08]Wait, I gotta... What the fuck?
[11:20.76]Why?
[11:21.02]What?
[11:27.68]Are we supposed to make all three on the screen?
[11:32.56]The ones that are right out here.
[11:33.86]You have to make them.
[11:34.80]It's like Diner Dash.
[11:37.58]How come it takes longer to fill a cup with a drink than it does to cook a hamburger?
[11:50.49]Because it's a fucking video game.
[11:56.69]Take it!
[11:58.75]Oh, wait.
[12:00.77]Alright, can I?
[12:01.67]Look, look, look, look, look.
[12:02.83]How many, okay, how many red sixes do you have?
[12:05.49]That one.
[12:06.28]I mean, how many, I mean, how many, how many, um, how many, how many, uh, uh, I need a plate.
[12:14.02]What?
[12:16.06]Oh, shit.
[12:19.59]I'm gonna throw up already.
[12:22.95]I don't understand why.
[12:23.99]This just came in.
[12:25.05]I've done the thing.
[12:27.09]Are these green?
[12:27.81]Two cheese.
[12:28.90]That's it.
[12:29.60]This is going to be easy.
[12:30.46]The plate?
[12:31.08]Oh my god.
[12:33.34]My wife is back VR-ing me.
[12:37.72]Who needs plates?
[12:39.80]You mean back VR.
[12:40.70]Does that mean that she's grabbing you from behind and moving your shoulders?
[12:46.97]Alright, hold on.
[12:49.83]The air is making this fall.
[12:51.69]I didn't make that fall.
[13:04.75]I don't know how to play.
[13:06.91]Start over.
[13:07.37]I'm serious, I don't know how to play the game now.
[13:10.66]What?
[13:11.16]Oh my game is printing out.
[13:14.10]I win.
[13:14.68]What do you mean you win?
[13:18.04]How did I?
[13:29.97]It's giving me the advanced, like, super lag mode.
[13:32.77]Oh, me -2.
[13:33.90]What did you do?
[13:34.38]What did you do?
[13:37.18]I got an order in.
[13:40.74]So you got an order in that puts us all in, like, throw-off mode?
[13:43.66]Yeah.
[13:45.64]Why?
[13:47.61]I can't look at this.
[13:49.69]Oh!
[13:54.31]Uh, next.
[13:57.55]Uh, play next match.
[14:03.91]Oh my god, I'm gonna vomit.
[14:05.19]Did you do max match?
[14:07.17]My board is blank.
[14:09.39]It's the patty.
[14:10.45]Wait, is that?
[14:12.01]Did I do it?
[14:15.55]I think I might have fucked up the game.
[14:17.57]Because I think this has been cooking for... You guys did this?
[14:22.10]I think the game's broken.
[14:24.68]Yeah.
[14:24.94]Why are these green?
[14:32.68]Alright, this is getting weird.

[19:29.25]Everything, you just infected me completely.
[19:30.75]Okay, let's play that virus game again.
[19:35.28]It keeps you there long enough thinking you're making cheeseburgers while it, like, gets your serial code, your serial number, your ID, and your birth certificate.
[19:41.99]Alright, hold on.
[19:46.15]I need to, like... Where's my hand?
[19:49.67]God damn it.

[20:29.82]God damn it.
[20:33.34]Why did the chef game have to do this to us?
[20:38.06]Oh my... It completely logged me out of Steam.
[20:41.01]I don't know my password.
[20:43.53]Hold on, dude.
[20:44.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[20:44.43]What are you talking about?

[20:54.27]Yeah.
[21:01.65]How did you get logged out of Steam?
[21:05.88]Tell me that I got my serial key and my card numbers.
[21:19.25]For the love of God.
[21:21.13]Would you guys just go?
[21:22.87]No, no, we're... Technical difficulty stream, welcome!
[21:32.85]You guys are just like floating around.
[21:38.17]I had a profile saved.
[21:39.63]Where is it?
[21:39.99]Why is it not here?
[21:40.67]Oh my god, I'm so confused right now.
[21:49.79]This is like, I'm playing the claw game right now.
[22:00.17]I'm at Dave and Buster's.
[22:01.07]Hopefully I win the fucking big teddy bear.
[22:06.89]There we go.
[22:09.77]Sort of, right?
[22:16.92]This is the kind of shit that, like, that... Why don't you have a fucking stronger password?
[22:28.25]Okay, let me take a look.
[22:30.58]Are you still here?
[22:33.48]Is he gone?
[22:34.44]He might not even be here.
[22:38.20]Gotta come up a little more.
[22:42.41]Gotta come forward.
[22:43.95]Just a little bit.
[22:47.85]He might be gone again.
[22:49.47]Are we infected?
[22:50.23]I don't know.
[22:59.16]I don't think we're infected.
[23:06.47]I think he's the only one that's infected.
[23:09.37]Well, uh, I'm gonna open up Tilt Brush and wait for him to tell me that everything's okay.
[23:16.69]So, uh, give me just a moment.
[23:21.45]This is actually kind of scary.
[23:34.30]Uh...
[23:37.64]I don't think we are infected.
[23:41.42]Alright, let's do Tilt Brush.
[23:42.76]Let's relax while we wait.
[23:52.58]Star is still technically in Discord.
[23:58.86]So, I mean, maybe eventually when we figure it out.
[24:04.11]I'm not so sure.
[24:05.01]We'll hear him.
[24:08.39]That's not him.
[24:11.03]What do you mean, not him?
[24:16.04]Well, let's just see what this game is.
[24:18.88]Tilt brush, I heard it was very, very fun and very relaxing.
[24:25.54]Hold trigger to paint.
[24:26.70]Let me see if I can, yeah, there you guys are.
[24:31.50]Alright, so you hold the trigger down to paint.
[24:36.26]This is... Okay, this is... This is what... This is unbelievable.
[24:44.22]I don't know what to do about this.
[24:45.90]This is un-fucking-believable.
[24:47.34]Swipe thumbpad.
[24:50.78]Point to interact.
[24:52.84]Straight edges, erasers, environment, camera, teleport, mirror.
[24:57.74]Mirror?
[24:58.18]What the fuck?
[25:04.79]Uh, environment.
[25:06.91]Night Sky.
[25:09.37]I'm doing my shirt.
[25:10.87]I'm doing my shirt.
[25:11.51]I'm going to make my t-shirt.
[25:12.37]This is going to be perfect.
[25:19.59]Somebody can edit it.
[25:20.87]How do I erase?
[25:22.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[25:23.11]Redo that.
[25:23.53]Let's erase right here.
[25:26.71]That's really cool.
[25:27.25]Alright, ready?
[25:29.43]Oh, there's more over here.
[25:32.67]Why does it keep changing?
[25:37.14]Sketchbook.
[25:39.78]Environments.
[25:40.53]Night sky.
[25:41.03]Okay, it's there.
[25:41.65]Alright, now, uh... Let's color pick.
[25:48.17]Light.
[25:49.03]Fire.
[25:49.95]Embers.
[25:50.71]Smoke.
[25:51.51]Let's get some smoke.
[25:52.33]What color do I want the smoke?
[25:54.28]How about like, uh... You know, there's a little bit of smokiness here.
[25:58.12]So if this is the shirt right here, we're gonna go... Nope.
[26:09.06]No, that's not going to work.
[26:09.90]Undo that.
[26:13.18]I need to make the brush bigger.
[26:15.02]How do I do that?
[26:19.93]Hard press left side of left touchpad to undo.
[26:22.87]Okay, cool.
[26:25.07]I need a bigger brush.
[26:27.89]That looks good.
[26:28.37]Okay.
[26:33.29]Alright.
[26:34.90]You good?
[26:36.10]I'm fucking drawing my t-shirt now.
[26:38.06]You have to wait.
[26:38.76]You good?
[26:40.40]Are you... You're having a little bit of trouble there, but you good now?
[26:49.20]There's my shirt!
[26:50.74]Hey bro, you good?
[26:51.96]I am good.
[26:52.48]This is so cool.
[26:59.61]Oh, this is amazing.
[27:00.63]I don't want to leave this now.
[27:01.87]Can you come into my game and do this with me?
[27:04.70]Hey, this is the real start.
[27:17.77]Wanna play a game?
[27:19.03]Yeah, I do.
[27:19.63]Do you wanna play Climby?
[27:21.09]Yeah, let's play Climby.
[27:22.75]Alright, I'm gonna have to come back to this.
[27:27.75]Because this is cool.
[27:31.80]Snow?
[27:35.80]Alright, this is really cool.
[27:37.42]But, uh, unfortunately, Star is back.
[27:40.02]So, we've gotta, you know, play with him.
[27:41.78]Oh, sorry.
[27:43.94]This is really awesome, though.
[27:45.16]I'll get to check that out later.
[27:47.88]What were you doing?
[27:48.98]Tilt brush.
[27:51.38]Oh, yeah.
[27:53.36]That and medium are quite nice.
[27:55.74]Alright, you ready for climbing?
[28:00.01]Are you actually good to go?
[28:02.45]I am in climbing.
[28:04.27]Okay.
[28:06.23]You sure about that?
[28:08.25]I am sure about that.
[28:09.43]29 minutes!
[28:12.33]Yeah, there was a foreign man at my front door.
[28:16.47]I gave him my social security and he said now I can play again.
[28:21.99]Is this you talking?
[28:26.68]This is me talking.
[28:32.98]This is a weird scenario here.
[28:37.22]Okay, so, uh, you ready to play this game together?
[28:40.80]I'm ready to play this game together.
[28:42.62]We got checkpoint, start.
[28:44.58]This is called Climby, and it's not what my current, uh, game title is, but that's okay.
[28:52.90]So, um, floor, grid, close, robot, cam.
[28:57.89]What does cam do?
[29:00.51]What did I just do?
[29:04.11]No, turn off camera.
[29:05.31]I don't want this guy fucking spying on me.
[29:09.49]so how do I uh how do we get in the same game alright let's get started um try walking towards it by holding your grip yeah hold on my channel is telling me I'm not live and now they're telling me I'm live they're well I just missed the tutorial because yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna stream VR again he said grip and then what do we do
[29:40.20]Good, good, good, good.
[29:41.02]Get the fuck out of my face!
[29:42.20]You have a new white surface within reach and climb up using the trigger buttons.
[29:46.36]Get out of my way!
[29:47.60]Go ahead and climb up.
[29:49.32]Um... Um... This is really cool.
[29:54.73]I sure wish that one of my friends was around to play this with me.
[29:57.57]Well, how do I join you?
[29:58.75]Hit the green to the finish line.
[29:59.85]Do the tutorial.
[30:01.93]Where's the tutorial?
[30:03.31]Just hit start.
[30:03.79]Help me!
[30:04.65]It's the start button.
[30:06.95]I can't wait to see you later, loser.
[30:08.35]There's no start button.
[30:10.34]What do you mean there's no Stark?
[30:11.12]HELP ME!
[30:14.95]Alright, where are you?
[30:16.39]What menu do you see?
[30:17.99]I'm in the big world.
[30:19.21]I'm in the Gary's Mod room.
[30:20.55]Hold on, just... I can't move.
[30:21.47]Oh, there's a thing!
[30:22.25]I'm gonna have to do this again, because I got, like, Star, the technically illiterate guy, yelling in my ear.
[30:27.21]Doesn't even know how to, like, set up his virtual headset.
[30:44.65]I'm in the, how do I move?
[30:46.71]Oh, this game's gonna be real fun.
[30:51.75]It is.
[30:52.35]It's like climbing.
[30:54.21]Alright, I'll go up.
[30:55.01]Maybe just like, I made it.
[30:59.77]Alright, this one's a doozy.
[31:04.83]Jump climbing.
[31:05.97]Yeah, jump forth.
[31:07.03]Don't worry about jumping.
[31:07.93]Remember when Valve made games?
[31:13.42]Remember when we made the portal?
[31:14.55]This is salty.
[31:17.35]Am I in a tutorial?
[31:19.49]Help me!
[31:22.31]You have Wheatley talking to you, right?
[31:25.13]Wheatley with the helmet on.
[31:29.96]Good.
[31:30.88]Do what Wheatley tells you, and then we'll probably be able to get into a game.
[31:35.66]He's standing in front of me, but he wants me to jump forward.
[31:41.08]What do I do now?
[31:46.90]Oh, shit.
[31:48.16]Get out of me.
[31:48.78]Get out of me.
[31:51.06]I want to play with Jerma.
[31:52.22]I already made that joke.
[31:53.10]You can't make it.
[31:55.46]What joke?
[31:58.89]The get out of me one.
[32:00.65]He's standing and he's fucking body blocking me.
[32:05.97]How do I get out of here now?
[32:12.72]Guys?
[32:15.80]How do I get out of here?
[32:17.25]Oh, oh, up there, okay.
[32:22.29]Next.
[32:23.45]No!
[32:25.53]You can't do that.
[32:30.65]Next.
[32:31.21]Oh shit, I got it.
[32:34.52]Did you make it?
[32:34.98]Get out of my way!
[32:39.40]Why are you like a baby?
[32:42.91]moving platforms!
[32:43.83]I just wanted things to work!
[32:45.55]Jump onto them and you will stay on top, grab onto the side of them and you will hang on!
[32:50.68]It's a marvelous invention.
[32:52.94]Go for it.
[32:53.44]I'm having so much fun with my friend.
[32:57.75]Well, I have to complete the tutorial first.
[33:00.35]Oh, no.
[33:14.90]No, it's too far.
[33:19.20]Oh.
[33:21.17]Oh, what?
[33:26.29]No.
[33:30.83]I'll listen to the baby.
[33:34.22]Stop that.
[33:35.36]You want your bottle?
[33:37.82]You stop that.
[33:38.50]Okay, I'm not doing that anymore.
[33:39.98]That was weird.
[33:40.52]I was pretending to be like his mother.
[33:49.78]And then how do I get over there?
[33:51.70]Oops-a-daisy.
[33:52.48]Easy.
[33:52.86]That didn't count.
[34:01.81]Is this really a tutorial?
[34:03.85]Yes.
[34:04.35]It's teaching you how to climb and jump and grab and swing and dance and move.
[34:09.20]Okay, see you in an hour.
[34:10.17]It's a little bit more challenging than the others.
[34:12.23]Remember, you can put down three checkpoints per level.
[34:15.25]Don't you dare bring that up.
[34:17.15]But if you just push the menu button.
[34:19.47]Menu button.
[34:20.26]Checkpoints, they make it so you don't have to restart the entire level.
[34:23.66]Nice auto-stroller.
[34:24.82]Every single time you fall down, just use them wisely and you'll be much less frustrated by difficult levels.
[34:32.27]Just stand on it.
[34:33.01]You'll stay on it.
[34:45.02]I almost ripped the fucking headset off.
[34:48.10]This is actually fucking cool.
[34:49.24]You don't like this?
[34:49.80]I just want to play with my friend.
[34:56.19]You will.
[34:57.61]And I'm alone.
[34:58.37]I can't even see chat or anything.
[34:59.83]I just feel like a dumbass.
[35:04.94]How about this fucking advanced technique?
[35:06.30]Ah!
[35:12.92]If you press the button to rotate while you're on the moving platform, you fall off.
[35:19.03]What are you talking about?
[35:20.89]Like, if you try and turn your character, I just fall off.
[35:23.83]I heard, like, a ting sound.
[35:29.11]I think I'm almost done with the tutorial, I think.
[35:30.81]I've just been breezing through this.
[35:35.08]Good thing I can see my chat.
[35:42.05]Oh my god, I don't have a checkpoint.
[35:47.95]I'm rushing.
[35:48.39]I'm dead inside.
[35:48.99]Oh fuck!
[36:03.44]Am I okay?
[36:04.26]Yeah.
[36:06.26]Just make sure to not orientate yourself and punch my wall.
[36:14.35]my god that's crazy we have to let you we have to like work together and oh no where I don't know where I'm in my room I gotta be careful
[36:42.11]Got it.
[36:42.73]Skip the whole damn thing.
[36:50.22]How come every game has, like, you can't do a tutorial with a friend?
[36:53.38]To give you confidence.
[36:56.56]Don't make me fucking laugh here.
[36:57.82]I'm almost done with it.
[37:13.64]Okay, this is the hard part.
[37:16.36]What the f- how?!
[37:20.00]Okay.
[37:21.14]One- only two more of this shit and I'm good.
[37:28.05]Got it?
[37:30.07]Okay.
[37:30.85]Last one.
[37:34.67]Bingo.
[37:35.31]First try, hole in one.
[37:41.45]He can't see us.
[37:42.27]We're going to have to let you be free and play the game as you wish.
[37:46.01]As you want to.
[37:47.75]In any sort of way that you want to play the game, you can play the game right now.
[37:51.88]Do not tutorial.
[37:58.44]Set checkpoints with your wrist.
[38:02.01]How the fuck do I do that?
[38:08.01]Wait, you just
[38:18.39]How do I get this off?
[38:20.41]I'm a big strong man.
[38:21.90]Go to the lobby.
[38:24.42]Alright.
[38:24.74]Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.
[38:28.02]Okay.
[38:28.24]I got it.
[38:28.54]I got it.
[38:29.06]Let's uh, main menu.
[38:34.15]Okay.
[38:34.63]Now, um,
[38:39.87]Servers.
[38:40.99]Start server.
[38:42.19]I think we can do it here.
[38:43.91]Go to the main menu.
[38:44.69]I'm just waiting for you.
[38:45.77]I'm doing my jumps.
[38:47.84]I'm doing my solo exercise.
[38:49.76]We've got built in.
[38:51.78]We've got some checkpoint.
[38:53.02]Start server browser.
[38:57.26]Okay.
[38:58.96]How do I do that?
[38:59.54]There are three people looking for a server.
[39:03.58]Oh, ooh, ooh.
[39:10.46]What do I do?
[39:11.36]I'm coming in your room.
[39:13.06]In my room?
[39:13.82]I'm joining you right now.
[39:16.80]Okay.
[39:17.62]I feel like you lied to me.
[39:19.94]No, no, no, go in a room.
[39:21.50]Go, like, open a room.
[39:22.92]I don't, you're going to have to explain.
[39:25.40]Okay, so you're going to go over to built in, okay?
[39:29.98]So you select a level, right?
[39:31.42]Like, let's say climbing 101.
[39:33.14]Start from the beginning.
[39:34.38]Okay.
[39:35.52]Stand, open up your, hit the menu button and open up your wrist menu.

[40:07.42]Okay, I'm in the main menu.
[40:08.74]Take a step to your left.
[40:09.70]What you're going to do is you're going to go to built-in mode.
[40:11.66]You're going to jump over to built-in and workshops.
[40:13.94]You've got a selection of levels here.
[40:16.21]Yeah.
[40:17.39]Click on 001 climbing 101.
[40:19.79]That's the first one.
[40:22.87]Or do 02 jumping 101.

[40:33.07]And then get in there.
[40:33.81]I'm touching it.
[40:34.25]Nothing's happening.
[40:35.31]Get in there.
[40:35.67]You have to probably select it.
[40:36.65]You probably have to say, hey, go.
[40:45.55]Make a private room to you.
[40:47.47]Alright, new play.
[40:48.45]Come over here.
[40:49.56]Come to, okay, the left side.
[40:52.18]You're going to go to create private room.
[40:56.80]Forget about all that shit.
[40:57.92]Forget about everything I told you.
[40:58.98]To the left, next to the options, there's create public, create private, create private.

[42:09.06]I'm in.
[42:14.14]Turn around and see your new best friend.
[42:15.96]Hey, you can hear me in the game too.
[42:19.31]Like every VR game.
[42:20.79]Well, they don't expect you to be like in a Discord on like a stream.
[42:24.67]Where's like the...
[42:26.16]Options.
[42:27.20]Input.
[42:27.58]Uh-oh.
[42:31.20]Mic.
[42:31.88]Turn it off.
[42:33.54]It's in the top left.
[42:36.92]Okay.
[42:38.20]Is that another player?
[42:42.27]It's me and you.
[42:43.19]What is that?
[42:43.55]You have like a lapel?
[42:44.91]What is this?

[45:25.22]Why did VR games decide to, like, undo everything that had been learned from making menus and UI in games?
[45:32.06]I think, no.
[45:32.54]Make things you can touch.
[45:35.67]Gullible is written on the ceiling.

[48:21.68]I'll get over there quick.
[48:31.45]Only one person can do that at a time.
[48:32.76]It's not fair.
[49:07.78]What?

[49:53.41]I grabbed it.
[49:54.11]I thought I grabbed it.
[49:55.33]I thought it said, oh, store has a checkpoint there.
[49:57.39]I don't know, I...
[50:03.36]So wait, you're saying that we both have our own checkpoints?
[50:06.44]I thought if you touched it, then we... No, my ass is achieved.

[50:21.39]And me getting to the end doesn't end the level.
[50:23.54]I'll get there, I've just been rushing because I was trying to beat you.
[50:37.38]Get it, get it, get it!
[50:41.34]Okay, here I am at the checkpoint.

[51:53.13]That's what Mario would do.
[51:54.31]How come sometimes you jump like I'm sliding?
[51:58.29]Because you're trying too hard.
[52:04.36]Are these like ice?
[52:06.34]Oh no, oh no.
[52:09.54]Like I'm not doing anything and I'm just being pushed around.
[52:12.36]Can I not climb this?
[52:15.45]Not doing anything.
[52:18.75]Are you lacking again?
[52:19.69]Is your computer going to blue screen?

[55:56.20]I'm out of checkpoints.
[56:26.85]Where even are you?
[56:28.37]I went all the way to the beginning because it didn't make one checkpoint.
[56:32.59]You should do those.
[56:33.57]I know, but I was about to make one and then you fucking started smashing stuff and I forgot that it was a game.
[56:47.46]Okay, I hit the wall and I don't know what hand is gripped right now.
[56:50.74]I don't know.
[56:52.38]Which one of these hands is gripping the ceiling?

[64:37.72]I was planning and correcting and...
[64:54.54]Are there no checkpoints here?
[64:56.76]You have to make them.
[64:58.36]I tried to press it.
[64:59.62]Oh, it went under.
[65:00.42]What?
[65:01.90]I'm going under.

[66:46.73]Where am I?
[66:47.29]I feel like I went back to the beginning and I have no more checkpoints and this is a hard jump.
[66:57.74]Crawl?
[67:22.65]Okay.
[67:25.11]I guess.
[67:25.45]It was a good thing there wasn't a wall in front of me there, because I would have went through it.

[67:39.99]Hold on, hold on, don't do it yet.

[71:51.45]Are you ready?
[71:51.85]Yeah, I'm ready.
[71:55.61]You sweaty?
[71:56.94]Go!
[72:05.67]I've become a pro at this.
[72:08.99]I did it.
[72:09.31]I'm a pro.
[72:10.59]Let me show him up right now.
[72:12.76]Nope.
[72:16.32]This is my chance to show everybody that I have what it takes.
[72:25.44]You say one thing about it.
[72:26.70]Hold on, this is weird.
[72:29.42]This shit's moving?
[72:34.21]The moving platform is freaking me out.
[72:41.83]Shit.
[72:44.13]Okay.
[72:44.41]I think I'm on top.
[72:47.85]What is this?
[72:49.19]It's weird.
[72:49.65]You gotta move with it.
[72:52.08]It's really odd.
[72:59.42]Bingo.
[72:59.68]I'm not gonna forget this time.
[73:03.33]I think there is ice.
[73:04.95]This is ice.
[73:13.05]Oh, mate.
[73:15.35]Okay.
[73:16.30]That's hard.
[73:24.94]Here we go.
[73:25.38]Gotta line it up perfectly.
[73:31.26]Oh, what the hell?
[73:35.26]Oh my god!
[73:40.06]That was too fast.
[73:47.67]Fuck.
[73:57.89]You going for it?
[74:00.02]This is awful.
[74:01.72]I can't go in a straight line.
[74:02.94]You gotta get right in the middle.
[74:08.04]Oops, trying to look quick at chat.
[74:09.82]I can't do it.
[74:12.00]I can't do it.
[74:14.22]Save the VOD?
[74:15.26]Oh.
[74:17.02]That's right.
[74:18.02]Forgot about that.
[74:22.64]Did I win?
[74:25.08]No.
[74:26.92]What?
[74:29.60]You're gonna win.
[74:30.26]Oh, is that the flag?
[74:32.00]Yeah.
[74:32.86]Yeah, touching the flag doesn't do anything.
[74:42.92]So, can I hold on to the flag?
[74:47.56]Yeah.
[74:49.34]Well, I'm just going to try to do that.
[74:55.23]I didn't get to complete that.
[74:56.19]I didn't get to complete it.
[74:57.57]I thought you said you were at the end.
[74:58.75]No, I didn't actually complete it.
[75:00.91]You took it from me.
[75:01.44]Because you can't.
[75:02.12]You took it from me.
[75:17.40]Oops.
[75:17.62]This sucks.
[75:18.80]Oh, you gotta wait a long time, huh?
[75:27.85]Yeah.
[75:30.51]Okay, let's just stand or skip.
[75:33.51]Skip.
[75:35.83]Why are you waiting?
[75:36.67]We need to skip.
[75:38.07]This is the level where you wait in an elevator.
[75:43.81]Okay.
[75:43.95]What am I supposed to do?
[75:45.07]I have patience?
[75:45.91]Ice cold.
[75:46.89]Careful.
[75:48.41]It's a little slippery.
[75:54.41]That's hard.
[75:55.54]It's got to be very small movements.
[76:07.17]Can I stop?
[76:13.16]Wow.
[76:15.26]This is some Mario 64 shit right here.
[76:19.14]Oh my god.
[76:22.30]You own the funny papers.
[76:29.32]You don't want to go that fast.
[76:30.84]No!
[76:30.92]I didn't want to... Oh my god, look at this shit.
[76:37.32]Look at this!
[76:38.34]How are you gonna do this reliably?
[76:48.59]I'm throwing up.
[76:49.47]That was... Oh.
[76:56.65]Easy.
[77:11.37]Oh, wow.
[77:12.80]I feel like this is gonna be worse than elevators.
[77:23.62]I think you might just have to go for it like this.
[77:25.72]Nope.
[77:30.17]Wait a minute.
[77:31.69]Wait a minute.
[77:33.56]Wait a minute.
[77:53.70]oh oh that's so weird I think you really just have to do it really really slow like a snail's crawl I'm pretty sure you are but you can't I can't do that turn slowly the force you need to do a right angle like sends me just walk just walk walk walk just walk
[78:23.16]Just walk?
[78:24.92]How do you... What do you mean just walk?
[78:28.80]Walk forward.
[78:29.41]Turn.
[78:31.05]Walk backwards.
[78:32.27]No.
[78:33.65]He's on to something.
[78:52.79]Boom.
[78:53.21]Wait, hold on.
[78:53.79]That was close.
[79:00.58]Grip and just pull.
[79:01.80]That's what we're doing.
[79:02.68]But you start flying when you do the second pull.
[79:05.72]So, for instance, ready?
[79:06.52]Grip and, like, pull.
[79:08.54]Like, grip, pull.
[79:09.60]See how fucking... You just start flying.
[79:14.42]Hold grips and swing arms.
[79:18.38]This is how this was intended to be.
[79:40.48]grips not trick wait star look at me for a second yeah what how are you doing that I don't know I'm just like practicing for a while so I haven't got figured out I'm doing a pretty good job I think it's the grips grips not triggers grips
[80:11.08]I need to do a walking animation.
[80:12.22]I don't want to mess up my strategy.
[80:16.70]That's okay, you won't need to.
[80:17.66]Ow.
[80:28.14]This is a great strat.
[80:37.90]Oh!
[80:38.46]Criken!
[80:39.94]Criken?! !
[80:54.47]I'm just like the orangutan.
[80:56.29]Just like... You're like the mom.
[80:59.76]You pulled me.
[81:01.68]You're the mom orangutan, and I'm like the baby.
[81:04.01]Get off of me!
[81:27.36]It cold.
[81:28.66]Find place for winter.
[81:34.01]What?
[81:34.69]Okay, I see.
[81:35.81]That thing makes you fall backwards.
[81:37.55]You can't do it there anymore.
[81:42.59]Oh my god!
[81:44.22]Get us out!
[81:45.30]I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down.
[81:51.84]Just beat it.
[81:56.34]Don't fall, please.
[82:09.78]What?
[82:10.00]I did the swish.
[82:11.02]Oh, my back.
[82:11.80]I just hurt my back.
[82:13.74]I just hurt my back.
[82:15.98]My back hurts.
[82:17.32]You got to say the swish out loud.
[82:18.70]I hurt.
[82:19.18]You got to touch.
[82:20.38]I'm going to sit the next one up.
[82:26.36]I think it was when I did the shake thing.
[82:29.38]Jake, wait.
[82:29.90]You got one of those too?
[82:31.79]No.
[82:33.27]That was my... What's that?
[82:36.25]I hit the ceiling.
[82:39.21]God damn it.
[82:40.85]I have to go to a chiropractor and have him do the fucking Undertaker move where he breaks my back.
[82:50.65]I want to go to a chiropractor that gives me a fucking tombstone.
[82:53.63]I beat it!
[82:54.37]I beat it!
[82:55.05]I beat it!
[82:56.33]I beat it!
[82:58.07]Just bring me to a fucking cane, the fucking chiropractor.
[83:00.57]Have them like scoop me up and do like the fucking tombstone pile driving to me.
[83:05.46]Just end it.
[83:05.92]I beat it.
[83:07.18]I beat it.
[83:08.28]I beat it.
[83:09.50]I beat it.
[83:16.55]Oh, were we playing ping pong?
[83:28.61]Bounce.
[83:29.19]Bounce, you stupid game.
[83:30.93]Dumb.
[83:31.27]Wow, this game is so dumb.
[83:38.48]I'm actually really surprised that we're still playing this and I'm having fun.
[83:42.22]I expected this game to be... No, I told you.
[83:47.35]This is a chat request.
[83:48.35]Somebody in chat last night said you guys should play Climbing.
[83:53.05]They said, you'd probably get a couple of fun, interesting, like, orangutan on the mother jokes.
[83:57.78]And I was like, that sounds like a good idea.
[84:05.86]Oh, my God.
[84:07.12]Oops.
[84:14.03]I win.
[84:14.67]I win.
[84:15.41]I win.
[84:15.73]I win.
[84:17.31]I win.
[84:20.33]Are you literally jumping?
[84:21.49]Stop.
[84:21.87]Stop it.
[84:27.08]Don't, don't go yet.
[84:43.65]You're doing good.
[84:45.83]You sure you want me to end this?
[84:46.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:48.00]Okay.
[84:48.70]No!
[84:49.04]Dremel was just joking.
[84:51.62]He could beat that level any time he wants.
[84:54.82]I was, that was the one!
[84:55.96]High five, right there.
[84:57.32]He was just, he was just joking.
[85:08.94]I just actually put that in my fucking mouth.
[85:10.66]Hit my tongue and mouth.
[85:13.36]Tongue and mouth!
[85:14.48]You're not gonna get me, are ya?
[85:20.33]Get me up to the, get me up to the summit!
[85:25.73]I'm just like the parrot that you bring with you that grants wishes.
[85:28.19]The parrot?
[85:30.25]Yeah.
[85:33.24]What?
[85:39.56]I love the parrot who grants wishes.
[85:46.23]Okay, excuse me.
[85:47.07]Not that fast.
[85:48.43]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[85:48.99]Come here.
[85:51.02]Get on my back.
[85:51.78]I need one of these too.
[85:53.08]Get on my back.
[85:53.92]Why did you push me, sir?
[85:58.40]I was putting a checkpoint down and you pushed me.
[86:01.33]You can't push.
[86:02.39]You pushed me.
[86:03.29]You did.
[86:03.71]I promise.
[86:05.29]I bet you, I bet you 500 cents.
[86:09.54]Call my lawyer.
[86:11.98]You don't have a lawyer.
[86:13.97]I know this because I've sued you before.
[86:16.31]And won easily.
[86:17.53]You showed up there.
[86:18.93]You showed up in a fucking tank top and pantsuit.
[86:22.09]Suit pants.
[86:23.07]You showed up in a fucking chicken costume.
[86:25.09]Yeah, but I was in a goddamn suit.
[86:28.93]Underneath?
[86:32.79]No.
[86:33.09]Yeah, underneath.
[86:34.07]I was in a suit under that chicken costume.
[86:43.74]Where's my, where's my, like, mom?
[86:45.36]I don't want to do this part.
[86:49.96]I feel like, I feel like that's you on every level.
[86:56.67]No!
[86:57.43]What?
[86:59.29]Oh, what?
[87:00.11]What?
[87:07.84]Hey, see you later.
[87:10.62]This respawn is terrible.
[87:12.33]I don't want to get thrown off while I make a checkpoint.
[87:14.93]That'd be sweet.
[87:21.59]Thank you.
[87:21.97]Oh, I see your checkpoint.
[87:26.12]Ow.
[87:28.60]You know what I'm really concerned about with VR?
[87:30.44]I win.
[87:30.72]I win.
[87:31.92]I win.
[87:32.88]Just fire for a second.
[87:34.56]Let me tell you this, because this is unimportant.
[87:37.20]What?
[87:37.38]You know how... Okay, so when you have a VR helmet on...
[87:40.69]It's just... I hear that cheering.
[87:43.75]And it's infuriating me.
[87:48.39]You know when you have a VR headset and your wife cheers for you and it infuriates you?
[87:51.93]So you know when you have... When you have a VR headset on, you know how the glass is really, really close to your eyes, right?
[88:00.36]Yeah.
[88:01.58]It's literally right here.
[88:02.62]Not that it fogs up.
[88:03.96]Not that it fogs up.
[88:04.84]I'm talking about like... I kind of have this weird concern...
[88:08.60]You know how you accidentally, like, smash your face into a wall, you bump, like, your controller into your face?
[88:15.01]What's the testing?
[88:15.65]Have they done, like, extensive safety testing where if, like, I punch my face accidentally, the glass shatters, it's not gonna shoot into my eyes?
[88:21.09]No.
[88:22.55]What do you think about that?
[88:23.97]You know, like, you, like, bang, you hit the headset.
[88:26.61]What if it just explodes the glass straight into your eyes?
[88:28.75]Have they, like, done some tests of that yet?
[88:33.45]Or are we the test subjects?
[88:34.97]Because VR's not really caught on yet.
[88:40.15]You're so smart.
[88:41.91]Okay, next level.
[88:42.77]Just do it.
[88:44.73]Oh, that was it.
[88:46.15]We win.
[88:52.67]It's probably made out of safety glass.
[88:56.86]Is there a level that we didn't do?
[89:00.28]No, that was it.
[89:02.64]We did Skyscraper?
[89:04.72]That was the one we just did.
[89:06.37]Oh, that was fun.
[89:12.30]We did it.
[89:12.64]We beat it.
[89:13.10]I guess it's just workshop stuff after this.
[89:15.65]Oh, there's like an open workshop button.
[89:17.59]Oh, really?
[89:19.85]That's actually pretty cool.
[89:20.83]If you wanted to play more, I don't know.
[89:23.53]We can move on.
[89:24.27]Let's take a little chat poll here.
[89:26.91]What do you guys think?
[89:28.57]You want more Star does really well while I pretend to grab onto him as a baby monkey?
[89:34.37]No matter what game we play, that's going to happen.
[89:38.60]I'm seeing a lot of next.
[89:42.54]My cams like frame rate wrong here.
[89:46.92]Why is my camera's frame rate like fucking off?
[89:59.27]That's a ball that's weird I Think I think every people want us to move on.
[90:08.13]Okay, I
[90:11.64]Uh, so we got... Pavlov.
[90:16.55]We also have... Pulsar, the Lost Colony.
[90:22.95]I don't know which one of those is better.
[90:25.23]We should probably end on Pavlov, because we'll probably be in that for a little while.
[90:32.20]Uh, we had Chef Game that turned out to... Blue screen your computer.
[90:35.46]Hack your computer, yeah.
[90:38.08]Alright, you want to take like a quick little piss break?
[90:39.86]Grab like a water?
[90:42.91]I'm a gamer, so I'm ready.
[90:45.17]That's a lie.
[90:46.11]But you can take a break.
[90:47.03]I kind of need to wipe the glass down.
[90:50.35]Now I'm like afraid it's going to break and shatter into my eyes.
[90:55.56]Okay.
[90:56.92]He's a gamer.
[90:59.72]Alright, let's do Pulsar.
[91:01.96]So we'll get out of this and we'll move on to Pulsar and then we'll go to Pavlov.
[91:04.88]I have the lowest expectations for Pulsar, but I'm coming in with an open mind.
[91:12.18]Okay.
[91:12.38]I don't know.
[91:13.16]I just get the vibe it's going to be like NPC talking to people, reading boards, you know.
[91:18.49]Well, if it is, then we can just move on to Pavlov.
[91:20.39]It's not a big deal.
[91:21.29]And I can't read.
[91:21.97]You know that about me.
[91:23.37]Wait, did somebody just say you literally cannot play this game without five people?
[91:27.87]You can't do this with two people?
[91:29.97]It is driving a ship, so I also worried, like, how... You physically can't play this without five people.
[91:38.84]Pavlov does not... does kind of need a... Can't we do all of it?
[91:46.94]Just do three stream snipers.
[91:51.35]Well, whatever.
[91:53.11]Let's just do Pavi.
[91:55.79]What?
[91:57.15]You don't even want to give that a try?
[92:00.43]Alright.
[92:01.21]You don't even want to give that a try?
[92:02.33]Um...
[92:07.68]Not really.
[92:08.20]Alright, I'll let you think about it.
[92:09.66]By the way, you're up in mic right now.
[92:11.32]Okay.
[92:11.86]I'll let you think about it.
[92:12.60]Whatever you want to do.
[92:13.50]You know what?
[92:14.42]Since we played VR last week, I've been waiting to do this again.
[92:17.54]So, I'm really excited.
[92:18.87]Alright, well, you got a hot mic right now.
[92:23.35]Just want to make sure you know.
[92:24.95]Yeah.
[92:25.61]You're streaming too.
[92:26.27]What the fuck am I talking about?
[92:30.21]Don't talk about your credit card.
[92:31.87]Just go pee.
[92:32.86]Just go pee.
[92:33.88]Alright, I'll be right back.
[95:33.60]Hey, stop.
[95:37.96]Hot mic.
[95:38.56]Hot mic.
[95:38.90]I don't know.
[95:44.77]Hot mic.
[95:46.37]Don't say credit card.
[95:49.99]Hey, do you want to be in the water bottle?
[95:55.29]No, don't say the word credit card.
[95:57.99]Okay.
[95:59.59]You got a hot mic here.
[96:01.37]Okay.
[96:03.35]Wait, was I on hot mic before?
[96:06.42]No.
[96:07.30]Are you sure?
[96:08.70]I can't do that.
[96:10.96]I know you were streaming.
[96:11.82]I just want to make sure I wasn't hot mic'd.
[96:14.66]I'm streaming.
[96:15.86]Yes.
[96:16.48]Oh, okay.
[96:18.46]So when you said your credit card.
[96:20.31]Yeah.
[96:21.59]Probably shouldn't have done that then.
[96:23.85]That's alright.
[96:24.59]Whatever.
[96:24.83]I'll just cancel it.
[96:28.73]Okay.
[96:28.83]Okay.
[96:31.18]sometimes it feels like it's easier to cancel your credit card than cancel payments like like you know how you said we were definitely not done playing edf and then you never played it again uh yeah yeah so I still have the PlayStation subscription but my PlayStation is completely unplugged and the only way to cancel it is to plug it all back in and then I still wouldn't get to play edf sorry I can't hear you with my fresh beard that I just opened
[97:00.45]Let's turn this off.
[97:01.81]Alright, Pavlov.
[97:02.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[97:03.51]Which one are we doing?
[97:04.27]Are we doing Pavlov or are we doing Pulsar?
[97:06.64]They both start with P and they both have L's in them.
[97:09.82]Which P word are we doing?
[97:12.12]Given... Honestly, I think it's going to take 30 minutes to set up a VR game.
[97:17.26]Tradition has shown.
[97:18.10]And then we're going to play Pavlov for 10.
[97:21.32]I mean, not Pavlov.
[97:22.45]Pulsar.
[97:24.75]Alright, okay.
[97:25.71]I'm opening Pavlov right now.
[97:28.15]Okay, Pavlov.
[97:30.72]He just doesn't want to play Pulsar, and that's fine.
[97:32.46]Let me get the VRB screen off.
[97:39.14]Yeah, I know.
[97:40.82]Can we get at least... Can we get a handful of screenshots of every time I have the helmet off in VR?
[97:47.78]So I get a good view.
[97:49.24]I want them compared in a collage.
[97:50.60]You know what I'm saying?
[97:56.40]Whoever has, like, the technology to screenshot a screen, just, you know, use it wisely, though.
[98:02.89]Alright, I'm closing this.
[98:06.53]Kalami was fun.
[98:07.17]It was worth playing.
[98:10.13]Ten bucks.
[98:11.01]Pretty cheap.
[98:14.40]Show the close-up of your face.
[98:18.32]It's still there.
[98:25.13]Alright, so you should be... People can hear you, right?
[98:30.57]People can hear me.
[98:32.89]I feel like we'll be in Pavlov for a little while.
[98:35.77]We're going in.
[98:37.83]I'm launching it as we speak.
[98:39.94]We're going in.
[98:43.20]Okay, I'm going in.
[98:44.48]Not yet.
[98:44.80]Okay, I'm going in.
[98:46.16]Not yet, hold on.
[98:46.92]Ow, my knees!
[98:48.24]Ah!
[98:49.04]Ah!
[98:49.42]Ah!
[98:54.34]I'm excited.
[98:55.80]I heard this is like a full-on shooter.
[99:02.76]I just heard a gnome.
[99:04.44]Is this a gnome?
[99:05.32]It's weird.
[99:05.74]My stream is playing SteamVR.
[99:08.49]I'm not in that.
[99:10.67]Did you guys hear that?
[99:11.51]Did anybody else hear that?
[99:15.81]Okay, hold on.
[99:23.47]I'm not insane.
[99:24.95]That's a bad place to put this.
[99:26.05]Oh, this is totally broken.
[99:30.17]You good?
[99:30.56]No, you're not good?
[99:32.00]Not good?
[99:32.24]You're good?
[99:36.44]I'm really confused.
[99:38.54]What the?
[99:40.20]My stream is showing like the SteamVR menu, but I'm in the game.
[99:45.14]Okay.
[99:47.97]I'll be patient with you.
[100:01.12]What do you want me to do?
[100:04.05]I'm trying again.
[100:04.67]I don't know.
[100:05.07]What do you want me to do?
[100:07.73]Hold on.
[100:08.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[100:08.97]Let me just get in my headset.
[100:11.33]I'm stalling, so I'm trying to get air.
[100:15.70]There's no oxygen in this mask.
[100:20.02]You know, we joke around a lot.
[100:22.66]Yeah, I don't know if I can do this.
[100:25.17]Are you serious?
[100:27.43]Yeah.
[100:29.21]Pavlov is working for you?
[100:32.33]Yeah, I got it.
[100:34.37]Are you using OpenVR?
[100:37.01]Yeah.
[100:40.86]That's what I'm saying.
[100:41.86]My Oculus is showing inside Pavlov.
[100:46.24]How did you launch it?
[100:47.68]Launch it in SteamVR and launch it in OculusVR.
[100:49.86]What did you do?
[100:52.34]I launched it in SteamVR.
[100:53.74]I don't know.
[100:58.25]I got the game here.
[101:00.54]Let me try launching it from, like, the steam couch room.
[101:05.64]Yeah, probably a good idea.
[101:06.44]I'm going to get in.
[101:07.38]You let me know if you're still having problems.
[101:10.40]I'm getting in.
[101:11.56]One last sip of my Coca-Cola.
[101:21.78]It says you're playing it.
[101:27.47]You don't understand the problem.
[101:32.92]Where is this?
[101:33.50]What?
[101:35.14]Yeah, I don't think I can get this to work at all.
[101:38.84]I have no idea what to do.
[101:43.04]What if you open it in Oculus VR?
[101:44.60]Does it work?
[101:46.66]Can you actually physically even get the game to launch?
[101:50.60]The game launches, yeah.
[101:52.28]But you can't get it captured.
[101:54.41]Yeah.
[101:55.39]My screen is showing something that is not happening.
[101:59.29]Really?
[102:00.41]Yeah.
[102:03.75]It's like an infinite loading screen on my stream.
[102:07.37]That's weird.
[102:07.89]Do you want to try something else?
[102:12.31]I'm going to try one thing and see if I can add it as an Oculus game and then launch it from Oculus.
[102:22.04]Why am I moving away?
[102:22.88]Hey everyone, buy an Oculus.
[102:27.51]I keep hearing the gnome.
[102:32.47]Buy an Oculus.
[102:35.49]I think that's a joke where you're not supposed to buy an Oculus.
[102:40.14]Yeah.
[102:40.48]Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.
[102:44.12]That's me.
[102:50.81]Oh, that's because it's this.
[102:52.59]I see.
[102:52.85]I get it.
[102:55.19]Grab rifle using the grip.
[102:58.31]Okay.
[103:08.98]That's the lower quadrant to release the magazine, right?
[103:14.54]Now it's a completely blank screen if I launch it from Oculus.
[103:19.40]Just grab the back of your head and press rip.
[103:24.82]Touchpad display.
[103:29.08]Press menu to open the scoreboard, yeah.
[103:31.79]I'm getting like some resistance here, hold on.
[103:38.21]Why am I getting resistance?
[103:39.15]Okay, that's better.
[103:45.12]Don't jump out the fucking window!
[103:47.76]Okay.
[103:49.64]That's me.
[103:52.54]Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.
[103:55.90]There you go, okay.
[104:03.09]Play offline, play online settings.
[104:09.03]Okay, let me just try shooting.
[104:13.53]Every single game makes you do that, don't it?
[104:25.17]Actually feels pretty good.
[104:27.85]Excuse me?
[104:35.26]No, uh, clip in here?
[104:38.52]Where's the clip?
[104:40.38]Is grenades in this fucking game?
[104:46.44]What do you throw?
[104:55.16]OK, that's how you throw.
[104:57.72]So it's grab, activate, and then left.
[105:06.23]OK.
[105:07.45]The controls are actually really, really good.
[105:13.21]I will say, I want to shoot this gun, though.
[105:14.71]Let me try this thing.
[105:21.65]Excuse me, what are you doing?
[105:25.14]What's the deal?
[105:37.22]What's going on here?
[105:37.95]Why can't I shoot this?
[105:41.09]I gotta cock it?
[105:42.43]Oh.
[105:42.99]Hello?
[105:43.49]Hello.
[105:44.15]Are you good?
[105:45.71]My chat said your game is loud and also we might have to play in the beta branch.
[105:50.29]The beta?
[105:50.77]We both have to be in the beta.
[105:55.03]Uh, okay.
[105:55.31]Do we have to download the game again?
[105:57.64]Uh, no, if you just right-click properties, switch to beta, it's a short download.
[106:05.20]Uh, can you confirm that that works first?
[106:07.64]Yeah, I'm doing that.
[106:10.66]Oh, and then I can launch an Oculus VR mode, so it should work.
[106:13.28]Whoa.
[106:17.85]How does this work?
[106:23.42]Bunch of beta boys.
[106:55.79]Alright, did it work?
[107:02.37]You good?
[107:02.81]Should I, is it confirmed?
[107:11.24]Hello?
[107:13.92]Trying to reach, is everybody here trying to reach a buddy of mine?
[107:16.36]Hello there.
[107:18.30]We confirmed the problem is solved.
[107:22.30]Yes, I'll hold.
[107:29.86]How does this one work?
[107:40.75]Oh, it's just... He's gone?
[107:49.22]Sorry.
[107:55.24]Hello?
[107:55.96]Are you good?
[107:57.22]Yeah, I'm in the game and it works.
[107:58.98]Okay, so I have to go get the beta claim.
[108:01.36]Yeah.
[108:04.18]Okay.
[108:06.22]Oh, that was a nightmare.
[108:10.03]Okay.
[108:10.35]I think I'm going to throw my Oculus in the trash after the stream.
[108:14.69]Why not on stream?
[108:17.41]Well, just... God damn it.
[108:22.41]Okay.
[108:23.17]Let's close this.
[108:28.44]It's fine.
[108:31.26]So I just go get the beta client.
[108:33.12]I will go do that right now.
[108:34.22]I'm done.
[108:38.14]So we're talking... I don't have... Do I have any betas for Pavlov?
[108:45.79]I don't see any.
[108:49.33]Just beta dash.
[108:50.75]There is none listed here.
[108:51.63]Yeah, beta dash is it.
[108:53.71]That's it.
[108:54.31]Okay.
[108:56.99]I'm getting it.
[109:00.90]Update queued.
[109:01.94]Why?
[109:02.26]Go.
[109:09.56]Come on.
[109:10.76]What's going on here?
[109:12.34]Game will launch in approximately three hours.
[109:16.84]No way.
[109:20.04]A second.
[109:22.04]Okay.
[109:30.44]Is there a reason why?
[109:31.30]There it goes.
[109:34.42]Okay.
[109:35.40]Pavlov VR downloading now.
[109:37.72]The beta client.
[109:41.26]I totally am too tall because I can't reach the floor ever.
[109:45.70]I'm always like an inch or two above the floor.
[109:48.32]Dude, this shit's like taking a long time.
[109:53.22]Why is everything always about you?
[109:57.66]I mean, this is... You're almost at strike three, man.
[110:02.61]What are you talking about?
[110:03.98]We had technical problems when we started and now you have technical problems again?
[110:08.48]I'm ready.
[110:09.18]That's two.
[110:09.66]That's strike two.
[110:11.90]Strike three means like... You know what it means, right?
[110:16.70]That's what it means.
[110:17.28]You guys should... That's my chat reading pose.
[110:29.14]I just had to, you know, every once in a while you need to pull your VR headset up and then go somewhere where everyone will tell you everything's your fault and to calm down.
[110:35.53]Give a tour of your VR house, sure.
[110:38.53]This is what it looks like outside.
[110:39.69]If you hold your hand up, a butterfly will land on you.
[110:45.18]Can't do that in an Oculus.
[110:46.78]Apparently you can't play up Apple VR in Oculus either.
[110:51.48]Mark Zuckerberg.
[110:52.50]Ow.
[110:55.65]What was that?
[110:56.25]I hit my mic.
[110:59.40]I'm in the virtual world out here.
[111:07.26]Where's the, where are the butterflies?
[111:08.48]There he goes.
[111:14.93]Hello.
[111:16.35]Butterflies.
[111:16.81]Alright.
[111:20.67]What am I at? 25%.
[111:25.12]Okay, do you have a problem when you wear a VR headset when it's up on your head like that?
[111:28.18]Do you get gamer neck?
[111:30.16]I have gamer neck wicked bad right now.
[111:32.24]Like, look.
[111:33.26]Just open my screen and take a screenshot.
[111:36.98]No.
[111:37.58]I'm waiting.
[111:38.03]30%.
[111:45.19]It just puts extra weight down here.
[111:51.60]Just go?
[111:52.40]I wanted to go, but I have to download this beta client, and it was downloading so slow.
[111:57.15]What the, oh my god.
[111:58.43]Blaine Star, because he, we have, we were ready to go, and he said, and I was like, okay, fine.
[112:08.05]I was like, alright, fine.
[112:11.95]What's that?
[112:12.64]Hey, what do we do?
[112:14.74]Ow, I just like actually hurt my hand.
[112:18.50]My leg right here is numb.
[112:29.90]I just hurt myself.
[112:36.87]I'm good.
[112:37.41]Everything's fine.
[112:38.29]50%.
[112:38.31]Alright, for this, you gotta go on cam and do the fucking default Fortnite dance.
[112:45.89]I'll show you how it goes.
[112:50.24]What's the one that goes like this?
[112:57.20]I don't know what you're talking about ever.
[112:58.96]I'm just burning conversation fire right now.
[113:03.22]Because I'm looking at a window.
[113:04.72]Hold on.
[113:05.95]What if I can't open the beta?
[113:08.21]Hold on.
[113:23.62]Play the painting game?
[113:25.20]It's almost done.
[113:29.13]Climb one of the trees.
[113:29.99]Can you do that?
[113:34.41]You can't climb a tree, can you?
[113:42.51]No.
[113:47.23]How come I... You guys should be on here.
[113:51.48]Hold on a second.
[113:51.96]This is... Hey, Jerma?
[113:54.74]What's happening?
[113:55.16]Is there any reason why OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?
[114:03.05]What did you say?
[114:05.37]I feel like every time I talk to you, you're not there.
[114:08.01]Is there any reason OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?
[114:12.47]I can't think of a reason.
[114:19.17]OpenVR pulls whatever is in your headset.
[114:27.59]What is not doing that?
[114:36.29]No, I'm just kidding.
[114:43.63]So wait, now you can open the game, but you can't capture it.
[114:54.37]Oh.
[114:56.36]It's because I'm on an Oculus, and OpenVR is for Steam games, is what I'm understanding.
[115:02.76]Really?
[115:04.23]yeah uh which is why if you have an oculus it should go in the trash even though it's uh it's quite the expensive bit of technology it's quite unfortunate that nothing works with it so all I have is desktop capture is there is there a way hey chat is there a way I can change the field of view of my desktop capture so it's not six
[115:56.32]falling down alright I'm about to launch the game I'm at 92 percent this has been like a pretty good break though I will say get to come out and like just see what you guys are saying enjoy the chat hang out with yeah yeah just you know just hanging out just you know nothing working yeah I'm just hanging out enjoying my uh beverage you know
[116:26.01]Why does emote only mode have to get turned on?
[116:30.19]Why did that person just tell me to fuck off?
[116:33.03]Hold on.
[116:34.21]What did I do?
[116:37.41]I don't know, ma'am.
[116:39.69]Alright, I'm opening the beta somehow, so... I'm gonna be just kind of chilling.
[116:45.87]Playing with grenades and stuff.
[116:48.83]Yeah, it starts you on a shooting range, so... I'm gonna try a few things.
[116:54.67]We'll just have a little fun.
[116:58.55]Is it opening?
[117:01.49]Oh, that closed the game.
[117:02.70]Okay, there it is.
[117:07.66]Yeah, I guess I'm in.
[117:18.30]Yeah, this looks ready to go.
[117:24.11]Please, this is the worst thing.
[117:25.51]I think I did it.
[117:26.15]Oh, it's alright.
[117:27.52]We're good.
[117:28.46]Just hanging up.
[117:33.08]Did you figure it out?
[117:36.10]Well, I'm heading back in.
[117:37.42]Yeah, yeah.
[117:38.14]Give me one second.
[117:39.36]Like, really one second, and I'm pretty sure I've got it.
[117:42.16]That's all good.
[117:45.34]That was so loud, it almost sounded like it was going to drive into my house.
[117:48.87]Okay.
[117:49.01]Okay.
[117:49.84]This person is brazen.
[117:51.80]They're starting to get even more ridiculous with this.
[117:56.59]One of these days, that car is coming through the wall.
[118:02.85]I can't wait for that guy to be in the next Jerma Rumble.
[118:07.53]And I'm going to put his stats at zero.
[118:13.04]Fucking Vroom Vroom is what that guy's name is going to be.
[118:20.59]okay welcome back why does this do this to me it just put it switches my hands easy god uh thank you for your patience everybody
[118:48.82]Well, we figured out how to get together.
[118:54.59]Your patience is appreciated.
[118:55.69]VR is a new technology.
[119:02.91]Therefore... You know the rest.
[119:12.53]Sorry.
[119:33.78]Press the right quadrant to open the buy menu.
[119:38.96]Pistols.
[119:41.89]Heavy.
[119:42.57]Oh, this is cool.
[119:44.21]Let's go with pistols.
[119:46.89]So, a little magnum?
[119:48.95]Okay.
[119:50.55]Close.
[119:51.47]Oh, wait.
[119:56.81]Where did this come from?
[119:57.61]Didn't I buy a pistol?
[120:01.31]How do I send this back?
[120:12.15]Alright, Jerma.
[120:13.15]Yes.
[120:14.27]Ten hours later, I apologize.
[120:15.91]This is all my fault, and I'm an embarrassment to you and your family.
[120:19.41]Thanks for having me over for Thanksgiving.
[120:21.35]Yeah.
[120:21.51]And I invite you to my wedding and all that, but I know now why you didn't come.
[120:26.21]What happened?
[120:27.31]I'm ready to play.
[120:29.56]Oh, it's giving me a random weapon.
[120:32.78]Random weapon.
[120:34.76]I'm ready to play.
[120:35.82]Alright, good.
[120:36.90]So, if I have a red button, I get a press button.
[120:44.61]Okay, so how do we get out of this?
[120:45.73]How do we play together?
[120:46.65]What is the menu?
[120:50.17]I guess I could do the thing like this, right?
[120:58.47]Play online?
[121:02.19]Can we join a squad together or play offline?
[121:04.17]How are we gonna do this?
[121:05.37]I don't know.
[121:06.73]Play online.
[121:08.15]Okay, North America, Europe, these are all like... I think you can like make a game or something.
[121:15.61]I think we just go to, so if you hold down the menu button and then hold trigger, you're going to get a menu.
[121:22.99]You're going to do play online.
[121:25.28]And then I think these are just games that are going on right now.
[121:30.12]This is just like a multiplayer shooter, right, Chet?
[121:32.64]Yeah.
[121:33.40]Do you want me to make one?
[121:34.80]I mean, maybe just make one and if anybody... Anybody watching right now that wants to play, maybe just join it?
[121:40.29]I'll send a password and, yeah, we can let people in.
[121:42.45]Yeah, okay.
[121:43.99]If you're playing, if you have... Actually, I was going to say, don't stream tonight.
[121:48.03]You have a headset on.
[121:50.31]That's the future.
[121:53.32]Bad idea.
[121:54.08]Don't do... Why is that a bad idea?
[121:58.86]We'll just turn voice chat off.

[122:22.94]Sound.
[122:28.20]What is this?
[122:35.97]Is there no sound options?
[122:39.22]There is no sound option.
[122:40.56]It's grayed out.
[122:45.40]There is no audio setting, okay.
[122:53.40]So, we're gonna get stream sniped and people are gonna be very bad, apparently.
[122:59.59]Well, there's friendly fire.
[123:01.23]You can turn bots on.
[123:02.93]You want to just like warm up?
[123:04.51]Okay, I see your lobby right there.
[123:06.00]Just like whisper me the password.
[123:08.96]It's set to friends only.
[123:10.82]It is.
[123:11.26]Oh, so this is friends only.
[123:13.00]Yeah.
[123:13.86]So what's your fucking phone number here?
[123:18.45]It was 741 if you were on that menu.
[123:21.11]I turned it off.
[123:23.66]Okay, I'm in.
[123:24.12]Alright.
[123:25.30]So wait, how do we, so can I like mute me?
[123:27.46]Alright.
[123:28.96]See, I gotta mute you.
[123:30.32]How do I mute you?
[123:32.15]There we go.
[123:32.93]Yeah, you can mute people.
[123:34.41]Yeah.
[123:35.87]That's not a problem.
[123:38.61]Yeah, like mute Mike, like yeah, just mute people.
[123:41.99]Who the fuck is this?
[123:43.75]I don't know, it's this biz kid.
[123:45.19]It's me, Tanner, from high school.
[123:47.29]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[123:52.46]You gotta be ready to mute quick.
[123:54.64]I did.
[123:55.34]There's... There was a kick button here a second ago.
[124:01.58]A kick.
[124:02.88]Kick him.
[124:03.39]Get him out of here.
[124:05.21]I don't care.
[124:06.35]No, no, no.
[124:07.07]We're gonna get like five copy pastas for the people that come in here though.
[124:15.68]You're going by Jerma now, nerd.
[124:17.06]Haha.
[124:19.83]Oh, there's a mute mic button on the left.
[124:22.32]Yeah, just check it.
[124:23.48]But when somebody comes in, just hit mute mic on them.
[124:29.36]I swear I saw a kick thing, though.
[124:30.60]I just wanted to do bots.
[124:31.74]How many people are watching your stream right now? 6,000?
[124:37.67]For real?
[124:38.79]No.
[124:39.59]Because there's like 5,000 here.
[124:40.95]How many do you have there?
[124:42.51]I think it was like 800.
[124:45.08]So there's like 6,000 people watching this together.
[124:48.24]Only Tanner from high school has this game?
[124:53.40]Yeah.
[125:00.81]Collectively, we have 6,000 people.
[125:04.33]And I'm Tanner.
[125:08.10]Hey!
[125:08.26]You're not shooting me!
[125:09.80]I'm not!
[125:10.16]I'm shooting the bots!
[125:12.43]The bot was shooting me!
[125:13.51]I'm trying to be right!
[125:14.37]Why am I dead?
[125:16.15]Why am I dead?
[125:18.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, the, okay, the... They just walked forward.
[125:30.04]How do you reload a gun?
[125:42.91]What's the, do I have any more?
[125:46.19]Like I need more bullets.
[125:47.96]You don't even have to pump this?
[125:49.56]You have bullets in your sack on your left, I think.
[125:51.80]Oh!
[125:53.64]Oh!
[126:02.92]Look in your sack, Jerma.
[126:04.78]I'm good.
[126:11.19]I can't bend that low.
[126:15.63]How many, do you have infinite ammo?
[126:18.51]I don't know.
[126:20.30]Did I just shoot his gun out of his hand?
[126:22.96]What just happened?
[126:23.60]Are we playing the gun game?
[126:31.74]I don't know, I'm just playing, Jerma.
[126:34.48]Stop with the questions.
[126:39.99]I'm here with bot Kurt.
[126:47.64]That's a knife!
[126:59.82]Why are they letting me do this?
[127:01.68]What the fuck is this?
[127:02.56]They shouldn't be letting us do this.
[127:04.70]Do what?
[127:07.25]I'm just fucking shooting people in the head.
[127:15.19]Why?
[127:19.01]Why would the gun game let you shoot people in the head?
[127:21.34]This guy is fu- You're that big.
[127:24.46]I knew it.
[127:25.50]I knew you were the huge guy.
[127:27.36]I knew you were like the guy that was 400 pounds that was 10 feet tall.
[127:30.55]I should have known.
[127:31.19]This gun seems good.
[127:45.78]Seriously, this giant mag is out of ammo?
[127:49.80]He's out of ammo.
[127:50.70]Perfect opportunity to strike.
[127:57.64]What?
[128:00.72]The different trigger for grabbing the front of your gun is really screwing me up.
[128:06.97]This is nauseating.
[128:28.34]This actually is just VR Counter-Strike, isn't it?
[128:30.76]I don't know who that's hitting.
[128:37.96]You just bend over and pick up guns, right?
[128:39.60]Because I totally can't.
[128:40.66]I don't know.
[128:48.17]This is kind of fun.
[128:49.07]I wish that we could play with actual people.
[128:51.11]I mean, we can.
[128:54.95]Anyone joining?
[129:22.07]I want the guns that do things.
[129:23.61]Why do you keep spawning with handguns?
[129:29.01]What is this?
[129:29.79]Ooh!
[129:31.11]No, I didn't get him.
[129:39.08]I thought I got him.
[129:50.69]Why did it just hear you?
[129:52.05]Why is it... Damn it, I didn't get to see it.
[129:58.89]Fucking bot, Dave.
[130:10.84]Bot Dave.
[130:12.16]You got sights on you?
[130:12.90]Is that what it is?
[130:14.42]I was running at him with a knife.
[130:18.22]Footsteps everywhere.
[130:21.21]I got an itch in my nose.
[130:22.25]Hold on.
[130:22.75]I don't just... That's your back.
[130:29.81]How can I hear him?
[130:31.93]Wait, can you hear me?
[130:33.87]No.
[130:35.59]Oh, sorry.
[130:37.31]Hey, do you want Dave's phones behind people?
[130:39.31]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[130:40.15]It's all good.
[130:47.22]As long as you don't break TOS, we're fine.
[130:50.94]No, I got you, Jeremy.
[130:56.61]You look like a reasonable person.
[130:58.15]You're really tall, dude.
[131:01.35]I feel like I've seen you one time.
[131:02.35]I thought you'd be a lot shorter.
[131:05.63]I just thought you were reasonable.
[131:27.31]That feels good.
[131:28.63]Fucking bot deep!
[131:33.39]He went through way over his head.
[131:39.86]Do I have anything else?
[131:49.90]What?
[131:53.32]Oh, this is not what I thought it was.
[131:55.46]This is a shotgun.
[131:57.13]What do you have, a shotgun?
[132:01.89]Different trigger button.
[132:09.64]This is cool, okay.
[132:17.60]No, I wanna keep this, this thing's fun.
[132:27.02]No, Robin, I got this thing that I want to use.
[132:35.38]Well, this is alright.
[132:36.68]There's also like search and destroy, deathmatch and gun game.
[132:48.01]He's bottom fragging.
[132:50.41]Let's do gun game.
[132:51.01]What do you want to do?
[132:52.27]Let's do gun game.
[132:53.13]I want to play with other people.
[132:54.05]Experience all the guns?
[132:57.63]on data center good turn off friends turn off uh friends only they say so people can join I assume they can join even if we're playing let's start unless this is like 2003 I don't know there they go why is everybody doing bunker s alright hold on what's like the nuclear option though by the way uh I actually have no idea how do we people once we're in the game
[133:29.98]Hold on.
[133:34.70]Is there like a... Uh, if you open the menu the way you did before where you hold like six buttons down?
[133:41.05]Yeah.
[133:42.79]I can... There's people in here.
[133:44.97]No, no talking anyone.
[133:46.63]I don't, I don't know.
[133:50.18]Anybody have any idea?
[133:58.36]We're inviting a vampire into our house, apparently.
[134:01.54]Okay.
[134:07.69]Main menu.
[134:12.07]Oh, bingo, bingo, bingo.
[134:15.17]Okay, go to menu.
[134:20.42]So you're gonna go- thank you for- you saved- saved my stream.
[134:23.70]Saved our stream.
[134:24.68]So you're gonna go to mute.
[134:26.82]Yeah, I did that.
[134:27.70]You already did it, okay.
[134:28.50]Done with your- GOD DAMN IT!
[134:46.35]He's behind me!
[134:47.09]I think it's cheating.
[134:58.30]Come on, drop it.
[135:08.28]I can't even see your game anymore.
[135:09.52]Why?
[135:11.56]Why are they always behind you, Jerma?
[135:18.01]I pressed, like, the leave, and it just threw me the fuck out of it.
[135:20.97]I'm trying to, like, mute people.
[135:22.79]Oh, my God.
[135:23.83]I don't want to know what that is.
[135:28.98]Are you still naming your game Star?
[135:32.64]Uh, I have no idea.
[135:34.18]I could make a new one.
[135:34.84]I mean, I see Data Center.
[135:37.52]Yeah, that's the map I'm on.
[135:39.18]There's only three maps.
[135:42.48]Can I see who's, like, in this game?
[135:46.16]I mean, it's probably full.
[135:48.86]I clicked leave.
[135:49.56]I know, because I'm, like, trying to... I accidentally did it.
[135:52.38]I thought it was, like, back or, like, not, like, leave game.
[135:56.82]Oh, I almost just did that too.
[135:58.70]Don't do that.
[135:59.72]It's confusing.
[136:01.30]Actually, no, you do have to do that because now you have to make a new game.
[136:07.38]But I'm playing gun game, Jerma.
[136:08.98]I'm in the lobby right now because I did the thing that you just almost did.
[136:12.18]Okay.
[136:14.90]Kick somebody and invite?
[136:16.28]I'll just leave, I guess.
[136:19.81]Just kick somebody.
[136:20.69]Kick someone.
[136:22.43]No, that doesn't feel good.
[136:23.79]It feels better when the streamer's an idiot and has to make the new game.
[136:27.29]Play online.
[136:28.63]Creating lobby.
[136:30.60]Friend only so you can join.
[136:32.20]Yeah.
[136:33.44]And I'm sending a pin so it's only stream friend.
[136:39.10]Okay, I'm in your game.
[136:41.34]I think.
[136:41.68]No.
[136:43.32]I don't see you.
[136:44.32]I just said... You just... What?
[136:47.78]Your name's not Star?
[136:50.01]name is Ster this is definitely the lobby alright yeah no no this is this is what wrong that was a wrong game maybe it was the one I just left that you tried to join oh it's password seven
[137:16.70]Friends only.
[137:17.34]This time, just don't open the menu and click leave.
[137:19.68]It's not back.
[137:21.11]Okay.
[137:21.35]It's not resumed.
[137:23.63]It's actually leave game.
[137:24.85]Yeah.
[137:32.72]How do you, like, arrest somebody?
[137:37.24]What?
[137:37.90]Your final gun and gun game is handcuffs?
[137:40.68]Is it really?
[137:46.78]Nice.
[137:47.08]Alright, there we go.
[137:47.92]See, we're filling up.
[137:48.50]Alright, let's go.
[137:51.58]I'm ready to win.
[137:52.68]Okay, now I'm fucking ready.
[137:59.13]Good.
[137:59.75]Gun game, right?
[138:01.43]Gun game.
[138:02.09]Is this loaded?
[138:22.42]Oh, I didn't mute it.
[138:24.62]You gotta mute.
[138:25.56]Yeah, I did.
[138:26.94]Alright, we got it.
[138:31.44]What is this?
[138:35.22]Is this like a countdown that's preparing us?
[138:39.02]Uh, I don't see a countdown.
[138:39.96]It's like the ding.
[138:40.64]Cool, I got it.
[138:46.58]I guess you're a ding.
[138:50.82]I muted Josh.
[138:55.64]Fucking awesome, though.
[138:58.28]What is this like?
[138:58.78]Alright, I'll get it.
[139:06.85]Let me... Everybody is muted and I'm still hearing people talk.
[139:11.95]It's impossible.
[139:15.27]Oh, gotta go this way.
[139:31.60]That's the kill feed.
[139:35.84]Oh shi- oh fuck.
[139:41.75]Oh fuck.
[139:42.57]Oh fuck.
[139:43.27]Oh fuck!
[139:46.67]I should just always be turning around because I'm always behind you.
[140:02.92]Actually, I can still take this.
[140:04.55]Yeah, isn't that really weird?
[140:09.39]Let's drop that guy's fucking hat off.
[140:14.43]Give me a break.
[140:33.21]I got it, too.
[140:33.73]I hit him a few times.
[140:36.03]Dude, I hate the controls in this so bad.
[140:38.99]You do?
[140:39.39]I think they're pretty great.
[140:41.72]It's just different to grab than the other gun games we've played.
[140:46.10]You don't keep trying to grab the front of your gun and pulling out your magazine?
[140:50.30]I think you have to do it on some guns.
[140:54.41]You don't understand.
[140:55.55]You never understand.
[141:05.32]Oh, man, this is fun.
[141:06.30]You don't like this?
[141:06.90]I think this is a blast.
[141:07.86]This is awesome.
[141:09.37]I'm just... It's hard to get used to... Like, being the opposite of Cohen.
[141:15.93]He's back.
[141:18.85]Nice spawning behind me.
[141:20.21]See?
[141:21.25]Spawn.
[141:21.83]Uh, okay.
[141:24.35]Ooh, nice.
[141:25.61]Nice job.
[141:40.49]I can't, nobody can go up there.
[141:41.83]I got no scoped.
[141:48.31]Ah, really?
[141:48.99]Damn it.
[141:57.13]Ah.
[141:58.55]Nice.
[141:59.56]Good shot.
[142:06.50]Ah.
[142:08.18]Dude, I hate these snipers.
[142:09.26]This is so awful.
[142:19.54]Oh my god, are you kidding?
[142:26.32]I didn't kill him.
[142:27.26]What the hell did you just do?
[142:30.97]No, no, I'm trying to pull the little handle out.
[142:36.85]There we go, okay.
[142:38.73]Oh, it does it automatically, I get it.
[142:44.03]No, no, no, no.
[142:45.39]On the Uzi.
[142:48.75]On what?
[142:49.64]On the Uzi.
[142:51.60]Oh, okay.
[142:59.49]Shit!
[143:00.85]Oh my god, I hate you.
[143:28.14]Hello?
[143:29.12]I'm going to try and... Fuck you, Tommy.
[143:33.03]Ow!
[143:33.33]That's my mic.
[143:40.17]Oh!
[143:40.45]I hope you guys saw that one.
[143:41.96]That was fucking cool.
[143:42.74]I don't know how this gun works.
[143:59.86]We're here?
[144:06.56]Reaction time.
[144:09.98]Ah, somebody put the handcuffs on?
[144:12.37]Yeah, someone put the handcuffs.
[144:13.43]They put them in the back of the jail.
[144:15.33]You just bolt with two hands?
[144:18.97]With the right hand?
[144:19.49]I didn't know that.
[144:22.53]Let's do it again.
[144:23.09]Again, again, again.
[144:24.38]Oh, yeah.
[144:25.08]I'm unbolting with the wrong hand.
[144:28.60]I was doing it, too.
[144:30.87]I did the same level, whatever.
[144:32.93]Learn to use the iron sight.
[144:34.87]I mean, I'm just trying to.
[144:36.31]I'm going up there.
[144:50.01]Forget that.
[144:52.04]What?
[144:55.80]What?
[144:56.50]What?
[144:57.42]What?
[144:58.40]What?
[145:02.68]Are there people in this game?
[145:04.88]I think so.
[145:06.54]Should be.
[145:08.40]Yeah, there are.
[145:12.40]I don't believe you.
[145:14.95]Maybe there's not.
[145:43.89]Damn it.
[145:51.69]That was not... I did not... I hit right in the head.
[145:55.86]Got you right in the head.
[146:02.50]The whole game walking around.
[146:13.63]What the fuck?
[146:17.96]I expected to not find anyone for like 15 minutes again.
[146:22.66]That's what I have to say to that.
[146:26.92]He's holding it upside down.
[146:48.18]No one's gonna come down the death mall way.
[146:59.07]Jeez Louise, this is a bad one.
[147:04.11]I'm just gonna turn around.
[147:06.23]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[147:08.15]No, I'm walking in circles.
[147:09.41]Is there, um, you know if anyone knows if there's moving inaccuracy kind of things?
[147:16.32]Uh, that's a good question.
[147:20.43]Oof.
[147:21.67]Oof.
[147:23.79]He's about to win.
[147:28.79]Come on.
[147:40.86]I've been stuck on the same two guns.
[147:46.46]Oh my god, wrong button.
[147:49.91]Don't, don't, don't grab the mag with that gun that you grab it in all your other games with.
[147:54.52]I had to turn like that.
[148:02.70]360.
[148:02.74]Oof.
[148:27.50]What was that?
[148:29.70]Was that person spy crabbing?
[148:35.92]What?
[148:38.02]Everything?
[148:38.54]I'm so confused this round.
[148:40.14]That gun was single firing?
[148:41.50]It's like a machine gun?
[148:43.58]SMG?
[148:45.06]Why did I not see you?
[148:47.72]Oh my god!
[148:48.59]That's my mic.
[148:58.15]God.
[149:00.12]I'm trying so hard.
[149:15.57]Did I not get that kill?
[149:17.01]Thank you.
[149:17.95]I didn't get that kill.
[149:19.41]I was across the map.
[149:20.33]Yeah, I'm dead.
[149:28.18]Wait!
[149:28.52]Yeah.
[149:29.20]Yeah, that's where we were.
[149:33.68]Damn it.
[149:41.65]That's really weird.
[149:45.59]You have to, like... See, I didn't grab.
[149:48.15]It's a different button you grab gun with.
[149:57.33]But then you have to hold, I'm so confused on that.
[150:00.07]How do I have zero kills?
[150:02.37]You're bad.
[150:08.24]But this is fucking hard.
[150:11.08]Yeah.
[150:14.86]Again, again, again, again, again.
[150:15.84]Again, again, again, again.
[150:19.18]I have to solve the mystery of taking your hand off the trigger.
[150:25.73]Bottom frag, I'm not gonna review this bro.
[150:27.90]Yeah, after you take your hand off the trigger once, then you have to hold forever.
[150:31.60]Where normally you don't have to hold.
[150:55.20]Maybe there's too many of them.
[150:56.84]Yeah, there's- Did you see it just fucking spawned in the corner?
[151:05.56]I- I'm going mad.
[151:07.63]Shit, my headphone fell out.
[151:09.71]God, can I glue this into my fucking brain?
[151:19.29]My ears are getting too sweaty.
[151:29.60]I wish I could see how much health I had left.
[151:45.03]Okay, I win, I got him.
[151:47.33]I get one, I win.
[151:48.29]Go shoot me, please.
[151:51.61]Who's shooting at me?
[152:05.06]Oh my god!
[152:06.04]I'm feeling it.
[152:16.56]Fuck.
[152:35.25]Oh, whoopsie.
[152:36.85]Having problems here.
[152:44.73]You spawned right... Okay.
[152:59.20]I got you.
[153:22.50]Where did you know that I was there from?
[153:25.65]You're in trouble!
[153:32.81]It's the free upgrade!
[153:51.21]Oh fuck, no!
[153:56.92]Poor spy crap.
[153:58.12]It's alright.
[154:42.11]Did a lot of little bits of damage, apparently.
[154:47.41]20 hits for 7 damage.
[154:53.03]Here, come here, come.
[154:55.14]Go!
[154:56.24]Yes.
[154:56.94]Go!
[155:10.37]Am I- what happened there?
[155:11.99]Am I just like aiming like this?
[155:15.64]I'm trying to use the iron sight.
[155:18.68]Nope.
[155:24.59]I wonder what that looks like to people watching.
[155:32.43]That wasn't my kill.
[155:42.43]I am using the front and rear sights.
[155:59.86]The way that OpenVR works is it only captures one eye.
[156:05.40]So depending on where I'm holding it, it probably doesn't look like I'm doing it, but I am.
[156:12.82]Team Deathmatch.
[156:17.25]On a bigger map.
[156:18.53]Search and Destroy?
[156:19.25]Uh, we haven't done this one.
[156:21.81]What is this one?
[156:23.09]Team Deathmatch.
[156:24.57]Listen to my words!
[156:26.96]I'll punch you!
[156:27.94]My arms are covered in water.
[156:36.00]Change to the left eye?
[156:39.11]Unless your other eye is on your chin.
[156:41.59]What?
[156:45.88]okay oh my no I'm like trying to it's hard it's like a thing you never did before did it not work I think are we going we're going it's a really not loaded map
[157:15.22]Alright, he's played this game before.
[157:16.52]This is like two for it.
[157:21.34]No.
[157:22.54]No.
[157:29.47]I don't think I can change it.
[157:33.97]Can you not get to choose what gun you have?
[158:10.31]I want to see like a touchscreen of everyone in the room doing something wrong
[159:01.42]Is there a place sitting down?
[159:15.27]No!
[159:15.79]Alright, this is what I want.
[159:19.66]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[159:21.36]I'm ready.
[159:23.24]Just cover me, make sure nobody hits me.
[159:37.61]I'm gonna sneak up and just
[160:12.65]I thought I wasn't going to be able to shoot anybody with this thing.
[160:22.60]I killed him.
[160:23.64]Did I kill him?
[160:25.62]I have no idea how you're supposed to hold a sniper straight when it has no weight.
[160:31.28]Yeah, like looking through the scope.
[160:37.25]There's no way.
[160:38.59]It's so hard.
[160:39.21]You have to just lean back.
[160:41.06]I think you can get one, yeah.
[160:44.08]Yeah, I got a sniper rifle again.
[160:49.20]Maybe I can get this guy.
[160:50.85]This is such a bad idea.
[161:15.59]You're kicking off all the way back there.
[161:18.45]Fuck it.
[161:22.33]God damn it.
[161:23.65]What?
[161:23.83]Did I get shot by a teammate?
[161:27.92]God damn it.
[161:56.41]What?
[161:56.65]No!
[161:56.87]Put it down!
[162:24.27]Oh my god!
[162:28.25]Fuck, fuck.
[162:48.99]That's so cool.
[162:50.01]That's not gonna work.
[162:52.35]Oh shit.
[163:21.17]He's just waving at me?
[163:23.51]God, this is like a demon.
[163:26.66]You... look very uncomfortable.
[163:29.96]Really?
[163:30.42]Right now, with him.
[163:33.08]As long as it isn't down.
[163:37.80]He looks like... Did you get him?
[163:39.96]Worth anything.
[163:41.61]It's so intense.
[163:48.27]The intensity in here.
[164:20.75]Hey, just wanna show you, let me know where I am.
[164:29.12]Hey, no way.
[164:39.74]Holy shit, that was horrible.
[164:41.48]That was horrible.
[164:42.90]I just, like, fucking murdered you.
[164:45.72]Badly.
[164:46.36]Like, very badly.
[164:48.27]Jesus Christ, you need to buy guns?
[164:51.69]That was fun though.
[164:52.57]Search and destroy!
[165:03.59]No one's spawning behind me.
[165:07.60]Okay, if you want to buy a gun.
[165:09.46]Wait, is this camp?
[165:10.46]Buy a gun.
[165:19.91]Okay, so get ready.
[165:21.41]Okay, left controller on the trackpad.
[165:25.90]Right on the trackpad.
[165:27.18]And you can buy stuff.
[165:33.20]I got a deagle here.
[165:35.54]Left trackpad?
[165:38.21]Alright, uh... Wait, are we bad guys or good guys?
[165:43.27]I'm pretty sure we're the bad guys in our eyes.
[166:03.50]I'm ready with my little baby gun.
[166:07.08]Where are they?
[166:07.58]Is that a bad guy?
[166:09.56]Who's on my team?
[166:10.10]I didn't pay attention.
[166:10.94]I think that's a good guy.
[166:11.85]I just took one second to like see where I was in my room.
[166:15.87]My headset pulled on the ceiling.
[166:17.23]Is there a bomb in here?
[166:36.08]I'm dead.
[166:41.62]Bomb has been planted on edge.
[166:47.72]Where is this bomb?
[166:52.30]What team are you on?
[166:53.72]Have I played Counter-Strike before?
[167:05.78]Like, maybe three or four times in my life.
[167:08.66]Okay, let's go.
[167:18.83]You gotta put your hands down and move faster.
[167:25.21]Okay, just make sure this shoots.
[168:03.27]Behind you.
[168:05.50]What?
[168:06.22]Oh.
[168:06.48]I'm just saying I'm behind you.
[168:07.86]No, no, no.
[168:08.28]Just say behind, like a chef.
[168:10.00]Okay.
[168:11.20]In front, like a chef.
[168:13.70]Behind, not behind you.
[168:15.32]Behind.
[168:16.94]Behind, behind.
[168:17.70]You have a hot fucking, like a gross duck behind you.
[168:26.32]I don't laugh.
[168:31.31]I think they're, we scared them.
[168:38.64]I think I'm on a team.
[168:44.07]Who?
[168:45.73]Are we supposed to be planting the bomb?
[168:47.95]No, no.
[168:49.81]They are planting the bomb.
[168:50.79]We gotta stop them.
[168:51.83]Can I sell this?
[168:53.23]Ooh, I can get one of these.
[169:08.85]I just need to make sure it works.
[169:15.94]Cover me, Tommy.
[169:37.30]Covering fire.
[169:37.90]Covering fire.
[169:38.52]He's right there still.
[169:39.46]Did I?
[169:40.02]I threw his gun out.
[169:44.82]I thought you killed him because his gun popped out.
[169:47.19]3200?
[169:47.25]I like this gun.
[169:47.89]Wait, what's this?
[170:21.25]I don't know.
[170:21.69]I think we have to bring it upstairs.
[170:51.96]I see it down there.
[170:52.48]Ready?
[170:52.82]Put it here.
[170:53.44]Back here.
[170:56.25]There's a spot on this wall.
[171:09.73]I don't have one of those.
[171:13.70]You don't have it?
[171:24.45]I just draw.
[171:28.65]Oh, they're the ones planting the bomb.
[171:30.23]Why did you say demolitions coming in?
[171:32.17]Because I had bombs, grenades.
[171:37.71]Oh.
[171:39.15]I was trying to be like, how do you actually throw the grenade?
[171:41.85]Putting a little effort into the throw, you do realize if I did that over here, I'm going through the wall.
[171:50.04]When you throw in this game, you throw...
[171:52.60]Really fast.
[171:53.66]You have to hold grip and let go?
[171:57.15]Is it trigger and let go?
[171:58.45]Hold R-T.
[172:01.67]You just let go.
[172:02.49]Alright, well I ain't doing that again.
[172:04.55]Who wants this gun?
[172:29.34]All of you, like, monsters.
[172:32.94]Oh, that's not a silencer.
[172:34.48]Okay.
[172:38.20]I think I got, like, an extra hand.
[172:42.42]Okay, it's my time.
[172:48.90]Someone come out here.
[172:50.39]Let the rookie in.
[172:51.19]This is so...
[173:09.09]Okay, I'm gonna make sure they don't come down that way.
[173:13.85]This is really awesome.
[173:14.91]I don't have what it takes to play this for real.
[173:20.61]I don't.
[173:23.35]Do I have to pump it?
[173:35.86]Oh, yeah, very bad idea.
[173:38.84]Oh my god, I can't see!
[174:11.34]That's it.
[174:13.06]Time for the fucking big gun to come out.
[174:19.89]What's the other one?
[174:27.83]What's the other one?
[174:36.23]I just bought two of these.
[174:56.78]Can I like, haunt him?
[175:05.12]How is this guy always behind me?
[175:09.31]I should just assume.
[175:10.27]Let's go up there and see how things are going over this way.
[175:27.37]It's me.
[175:27.77]Hold on.
[175:29.78]I'm coming.
[175:30.36]Where are you?
[175:30.80]You still alive?
[175:32.52]I'm dead.
[175:33.34]I'm stream sniping.
[175:34.64]He's planting a bomb.
[175:36.10]Oh.
[175:40.71]He doesn't even know.
[175:41.29]This is going to be good.
[175:41.79]This is going to be good.
[175:42.29]Get a good view, Jeremy.
[175:42.83]Come on.
[175:43.09]Get a good view.
[175:44.41]I don't believe you.
[175:47.58]I don't believe it.
[175:59.00]It's almost like the term VR is in your name!
[176:10.10]Oh no!
[176:10.70]Is it gonna blow up?
[176:12.06]Can I like do it?
[176:12.86]Can I do it by hands?
[176:13.76]It says there's a timer on here.
[176:28.65]Someone's sneezing?
[176:29.37]Uh, I died.
[176:32.09]I'm just gonna stay with everybody.
[176:36.05]I'm just gonna sit.
[176:36.65]I'm just gonna get, like, the spam weapons.
[176:39.33]Fucking big guns.
[176:40.73]I'm getting spam weapons.
[176:43.33]This is the ultimate spam weapon.
[176:45.41]Automatic shotgun with, like, 50 rounds or whatever.
[176:48.05]I'm just doing double Uzi.
[176:48.95]I'm just gonna hold the buttons down when I see another person.
[176:51.93]Dude, I...
[176:58.62]I'm so sorry.
[176:59.42]I'm so sorry.
[177:00.08]I'm sorry.
[177:02.82]I'm so sorry.
[177:03.22]I'm really sorry.
[177:03.80]Watch out
[177:32.30]But I... I'm still trying to figure out how to jerk off the gun because it's not doing it.
[177:36.64]I can completely get out.
[177:38.60]At this one... Did that gun not do it?
[177:40.76]But why?
[177:41.72]That did not go well.
[177:43.62]I don't know what to do.
[177:44.92]Sir, you put away gun over your shoulder.
[177:47.22]I'm going natural.
[177:48.15]Do I have two shotguns?
[177:51.49]Do it.
[177:52.27]Knife only.
[177:54.01]Knife only?
[177:54.59]Alright, let's tell them knife only and then let me shoot them with the shotgun.

[178:17.57]On the right!
[178:21.48]Covering fire there.
[178:25.06]What's that thing?
[178:26.04]What is this?
[178:27.44]There's like a drone here.
[178:31.18]God!
[178:32.59]I fucking hate this game!
[178:34.84]Just because of one button!
[178:38.39]Hold the gun, you pulled it out.

[181:24.36]I'm not smart enough to take this.
[181:28.18]I know what to do with this.
[181:29.24]I'm going to server.
[181:30.38]I'm going to server room.
[181:41.47]It's too much.
[182:09.11]Can we come back to the climbing game?
[182:13.45]Oh my god, we're getting destroyed.
[182:15.61]Can we scramble the teams?
[182:20.62]Can we do that?
[182:21.86]Alright, surrender.
[182:27.78]This thing is decked up.
[182:29.54]What am I supposed to do with this?
[182:32.84]Where did it go?
[182:33.22]I don't know.
[182:34.34]He dropped it.
[182:40.87]This is way too expensive.
[182:43.01]I wallet-warriored this thing.
[182:48.00]I'm not supposed to own this.
[182:49.52]This was like a $75 gun that my mother bought me.

[183:35.07]Oh man, that's bad.

[183:38.59]It was pretty close.
[183:39.77]Oh my god, that was 1 in 10.
[183:40.67]That was a 1 in 10 game for me.
[183:42.83]1 in 10.

[183:54.50]Are there people that want to play?
[184:00.76]What?
[184:01.14]He's asking if anybody wants to play.
[184:02.94]Would you like a new lobby, maybe?
[184:04.63]That's a good joke.
[184:05.49]I don't think that's a good joke.
[184:15.55]So, what are you doing?
[184:18.19]I thought I was waiting for you.
[184:20.14]You're waiting for me?
[184:21.98]You were asking questions like if someone was going to... Oh, what did you just do for a game mode?

[186:46.09]You don't know me!
[186:49.91]I got him, I got him, I'm good, I'm good.
[187:14.63]We're coming for the data.
[187:18.15]Get over there!
[187:18.89]Come on!
[187:20.39]What is this?
[187:20.77]What is this?
[187:21.61]Where am I?
[187:22.03]What's happening?
[187:23.71]Are we okay?
[187:32.14]Oh, it's the mic.
[187:44.57]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[187:45.67]That had to be the worst offense ever of loud fucking noises.
[187:52.53]I was reloading the gun, and I just grabbed and smeared my hands all over the microphone.
[187:56.76]Nice.
[187:57.78]Hold on.
[188:04.10]It wasn't that bad?
[188:04.78]Okay, thank God.
[188:05.47]What did you just
[188:13.87]I've just, I've run a full lap.
[188:20.53]Inside of my ears is straight water.
[188:22.81]There's no way these are staying in for more than five, ten seconds at a time.
[188:32.39]I've got him right in the knee.
[188:33.31]I don't want this little thing.
[188:39.14]He's got two of his ears.
[188:43.40]Oh, God.
[188:45.38]You're all in big trouble when I find you.
[189:05.61]That's what I'm talking about.
[189:06.77]My fucking bread and butter.
[189:21.54]That's what I'm talking about with my bread and butter.
[189:26.39]How do you- It's impossible!
[189:29.99]My lighthouse, I broke it.
[189:32.35]I'm just running a marathon.
[189:33.39]I'll see ya.
[189:54.70]Where's the button to press to make this work?
[189:58.56]Okay, honest to God, give me a second.
[190:01.34]What happened?
[190:06.65]Okay, there's someone.
[190:07.77]Okay.
[190:10.55]There was someone the whole time.
[190:12.63]What?
[190:27.01]I don't get it.
[190:27.63]I don't understand.
[190:32.27]Watch out, there's a guy on the ceiling!
[190:33.88]No, the stairs!
[190:37.58]It was a grenade!
[190:57.42]Why are you in front of me like that?
[190:59.82]What?
[191:00.08]I swear to God, I won't stay in there.
[191:05.08]I've got to put the other one inside my ears.
[191:11.07]Is this one of those games where my thumb is really hurting from trying to run around?
[191:15.37]This game is wild.
[191:19.97]Run!
[191:21.05]Run!
[191:26.86]We're good.
[191:27.40]Save us!
[191:37.36]Oh, why am I... I'm losing my mind.
[191:43.42]Oh, God.
[191:44.57]My, like, tail's wrapping around me.
[191:52.31]Oh, my God.
[192:02.50]Oh my goodness.
[192:04.14]What, the drink?
[192:05.42]Oh my god, you just scared the shit out of me.
[192:11.69]Somebody just said soda, soda in all capitals, and I thought I just dumped it on the ground or something.
[192:15.85]Holy shit.
[192:24.14]Oh, that would've been horrible.
[192:25.84]Somebody's cheating.

[193:08.34]I'm almost back.
[193:14.61]Don't shoot me, it's not nice.
[193:17.65]It's not fair.
[193:37.76]I feel like I can hear footsteps on the other side of the map.
[193:40.86]Unless someone's next to me.
[193:44.74]Shit!
[193:45.00]Nice shot.
[193:45.60]I'm ready to game up.
[193:49.79]You know what they say.
[194:09.14]They say game up.
[194:15.89]Shit.

[195:27.04]It's like the Sopranos.
[195:30.50]Don't say that.
[195:32.70]What?

[196:09.83]Oh, it is.
[196:11.58]Well, sometimes it, like, pumps when I shoot.
[196:15.60]Can somebody be in front of me?
[196:16.92]He's going to look behind me.
[196:40.20]Nobody around until there's six people.

[206:02.47]You gotta believe.
[206:04.32]You gotta believe.
[206:08.12]Damn it!
[206:09.18]I thought he was upstairs.
[206:30.51]He shot his fucking helmet off.
[206:35.21]That'll be great.
[206:44.34]No one can be behind me.
[206:45.22]Oh my god!
[206:51.10]No one will ever be behind me.
[207:12.31]Don't say that somebody will end up being behind you They told you they weren't

[208:10.92]Oops.
[208:11.08]Why is that my kill?
[208:31.26]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[208:35.84]Did he shoot the gun out of my hand?

[208:39.85]What the fuck?
[208:44.09]I finally have a new fucking weapon.
[209:05.77]Too many fucking people in every direction.
[209:49.86]This fucking monster on the ceiling.
[210:12.04]I have never reloaded this gun before.
[210:19.12]That was worth it.
[210:19.78]He was behind me.
[210:23.98]Oh!
[210:45.21]Yes!
[210:45.69]That's game two.
[210:46.37]I'm getting better, but I'm not better than Guy with VR in his name yet.
[210:51.87]I got, like, sweat all over me.
[210:57.38]I'm shaking.
[211:00.44]I'm shaking.
[211:01.88]Game 20.
[211:03.90]Game 20.

[211:08.34]That's it.
[211:12.64]What?
[211:14.00]Hey.
[211:16.31]Just one more game.
[211:17.73]That's it, and then I'll be satisfied.
[211:22.07]After this one game, where I don't get on the scoreboard.
[211:26.66]This is the one.
[211:28.64]It's worth a shot, who cares.
[211:37.58]How's he not, oh man.
[211:41.34]I lit that fool up.
[211:52.67]No!
[211:53.51]You stole that from me!
[211:57.72]Oh, your in-game voice was totally... I just spawned here!
[212:13.02]Where am I?
[212:13.54]I don't know.
[212:15.40]I'm gonna slowly move over here.
[212:26.38]Who's behind?
[212:27.34]Somebody is behind me.
[212:29.15]Maybe not.
[212:57.36]Where the fuck are you?
[213:01.85]Oh, did I get you?
[213:02.93]I got him.
[213:04.03]Got him.
[213:13.18]My thumb hurts so bad from running.
[213:18.04]Fucking liars, I can't believe it.
[213:19.28]I'm not listening to chat ever again.
[213:22.06]I stopped aiming at him.
[213:23.16]I'm not listening to you guys ever again.
[213:24.54]I will never listen to you ever again.
[213:28.62]Dumped soda on the ground.
[213:29.98]Unbelievable.
[213:30.98]How could you do something like that to someone?
[213:38.73]It's the first thing I see when I come out.
[213:45.25]Who threw the gun?
[213:49.07]You know what?
[213:49.43]I just figured it out, Charmo.
[213:50.70]What is it?
[213:51.18]My hitbox is bigger than everyone's.
[213:52.98]Yeah, it is.
[214:03.25]Or maybe you shouldn't have the giant setting.
[214:06.03]I'm not a giant!
[214:07.13]I saw there's one other tall guy in here, and I was like, oh, that's what's going on.
[214:56.81]Where is this coming from?
[215:15.34]that she knows.
[215:17.64]Excuse me!
[215:45.37]I dropped it.
[215:45.79]Actually, I have no idea how to reload this.
[215:53.57]Whoa!
[215:54.59]Thank God!
[215:57.61]I got like an achievement.
[215:58.91]I got like an achievement for killing him.
[216:01.54]Aw.
[216:02.44]Wait, why was there a dude that was massive?
[216:04.82]He was like the size of a skyscraper.
[216:08.64]I don't know.
[216:11.24]Anyone's guess.
[216:12.92]I have no idea.
[216:13.83]That's weird.
[216:14.35]It used to mention that.
[216:18.55]What?
[216:18.81]I don't even know who was tall.
[216:20.19]I think it was... Maybe he is just that tall.
[216:25.17]He might be like 9 or 10 feet tall.
[216:28.84]It does actually scale with height.
[216:34.90]He's standing on a chair.
[216:36.00]It's dark.
[216:58.68]you like smell me can you smell me is that where he yeah why would you ever want the fun there
[217:52.88]Nice.
[217:53.78]Wall.
[217:54.14]There's a wall here.
[217:55.04]I gotta move over here.
[217:56.70]There's a wall.
[218:02.14]I got him.
[218:14.77]Where you got?
[218:22.42]I'm in the data.
[218:23.44]The data?
[218:51.86]Uh-oh, I'm getting disoriented.
[219:35.96]I just spawned there.
[219:36.84]I was just there.
[219:39.40]Hear him.
[219:44.93]Oh, shit.
[219:46.49]I'm going up.
[219:59.75]Yeah.
[220:00.97]Shit.
[220:01.51]1v1 me.
[220:04.96]Wait, where?
[220:05.38]I don't know where the hell you are.
[220:09.36]I gotta get a headshot with this thing.
[220:14.39]What?
[220:14.59]This is not a one-shot kill?
[220:18.57]This thing's not a one-shot kill gun.
[220:41.36]Right hand bolt.
[220:42.32]God, I'm sorry.
[220:50.13]I don't know why this gun's long in my hand to unload it every time.
[221:01.91]But I should be used to it.
[221:06.71]I'll take it.
[221:07.37]Whatever it is.
[221:20.61]Not bad.
[221:23.21]Not bad.
[221:38.16]Good shit.
[221:38.62]Good shit.
[221:42.06]I heard him.
[221:43.72]I could hear him.
[221:48.80]Yeah, I don't know how to reload this.
[221:53.41]Thank you.
[221:58.29]I just- I just left!
[222:07.81]Yep!
[222:08.29]That's what I want!
[222:09.45]I will gladly kill you, sir.
[222:20.58]No, it doesn't.
[222:21.10]How come the guy with his hands up won't run to me?
[222:26.62]Alright.
[222:28.07]Thanks for playing, guys.
[222:28.81]I was blessed.
[222:32.17]Please.
[222:33.29]Exit.
[222:35.71]That was fun.
[222:37.63]Yeah.
[222:39.33]How long has it been?
[222:40.15]I have no idea.
[222:41.54]Probably like four hours, maybe.
[222:42.80]Yeah.
[222:45.92]That seems a good spot.
[222:48.30]Well, that's very bright.
[222:49.16]Sorry, everybody.
[222:56.59]What time?
[222:57.43]Three hours?
[222:57.83]Yeah, just about three hours and 45.
[223:01.69]So... Ready?
[223:04.37]Um, I think... Unless there's something else you want to do.
[223:09.46]I have a couple other things I could play.
[223:11.78]There are a few things I could play.
[223:14.34]Okay, I could just play Beat Saber for like 20 minutes and go.
[223:18.67]It's up to you.
[223:19.29]Unless you want to play one of the other ones.
[223:21.31]I don't remember what else we had.
[223:25.00]oh let's see there's always pulsar nope no he's he's not he's not gonna budge unless you're the guy who made pulsar and you're going to remake it for me but what if I was what if I actually did you need to remake it for me
[223:51.89]Beat Saber Multiplayer.
[223:54.27]He's got way more experience than I do.
[223:56.09]That would be just me getting my ass kicked.
[224:00.16]True that.
[224:00.90]So I'm going to go.
[224:01.50]You have fun with your Pulsar.
[224:03.12]Alright.
[224:03.42]Actually, I got a handful of things that I could do here.
[224:06.74]Yeah.
[224:07.02]Follow me on Instagram.
[224:08.84]That was Star, by the way.
[224:11.61]http://www.Ster.
[224:15.03]No, no, that's not true.
[224:15.77]www.twitch.tv/.Ster.
[224:19.67]My Oculus Wire's been stuck behind a desk, and that's why it's been pulling on me.
[224:23.61]That makes so much sense.
[224:26.00]I should be able to walk any... Yeah, oh, that's great.
[224:30.70]Bye.
[224:31.40]That was fun playing with you.
[224:34.80]Enjoy Beat Saber!
[224:35.54]Because we're going to move on to... Alright, let's see.
[224:40.13]We've got Disassembly VR, which looks interesting.
[224:44.85]We have D-Rail Valley...
[224:51.08]This other game that I think I want to try Minecraft that's gonna have to be another day Pavlov that game was awesome.
[225:05.46]That was probably the best shooter for VR I think I played I did get these just for you know, one off little things here.
[225:19.53]I
[225:21.54]Let's try disassembly.
[225:27.26]Disassembly is like you could make cars and shit and like tear them apart.
[225:35.16]Looked interesting.
[225:36.80]Play Gorn?
[225:37.50]Did Gorn get an update yet?
[225:40.10]I don't think it has.
[225:41.94]Because last time I tried to play Gorn with the same settings, there was like a performance update that they did.
[225:47.20]And they were like, oh, we're aware that there are performance problems.
[225:49.80]I don't think they updated it yet.
[225:54.06]Did it?
[225:54.32]It did.
[225:56.42]Are you sure?
[226:01.92]Because I'm looking at the news right now.
[226:03.82]It doesn't say that.
[226:11.82]I'll give it a try.
[226:12.52]Let's try it.
[226:20.19]I'm just going to open it and see what happens.
[226:27.64]The beta build reportedly fixed it, really.
[226:29.76]How does this look?
[226:32.37]Because before it was like 20 frames a second.
[226:58.02]Uh-oh.
[227:01.36]Maybe not?
[227:05.66]Gorn?
[227:07.08]Hello?
[227:08.46]Are you okay?
[227:08.96]Okay, Gorn is... That looks a lot better.
[227:17.79]I can't tell, though.
[227:19.05]I'll give it a try.
[227:19.69]Hold on.
[227:20.09]Let me check.
[227:20.77]I'll go back in.
[227:33.52]I should have dragged it that fast.
[227:34.72]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[227:37.62]Let me wipe this down.
[227:45.53]The Vroom guy has to go home.
[227:48.21]No, this is what he does for work.
[227:50.23]He gets paid like $50 an hour to just drive fast.
[227:56.59]By the same string of places.
[228:02.75]Hey, so what do you do for work?
[228:05.07]Well, it's funny you say that.
[228:08.89]I get paid.
[228:09.51]I just drive around in a circle.
[228:12.23]Oh, you're a Lyft or Uber driver?
[228:14.45]No.
[228:16.35]Oh, I don't understand.
[228:17.77]It's kind of hard to explain.
[228:18.91]You know, like Twitch streamers, when they try to explain their income?
[228:22.80]Yeah, I mean, I'm like a guy, just a kind of a guy that has a platform that's called car.
[228:28.56]And what you see is I drive around in a circle, just me.
[228:30.82]I don't know that nobody else cares or watches.
[228:33.20]And I step on the gas with this one specific strip of like eight to 900 yards for probably 12 times a day.
[228:42.62]And I do it every 20 minutes.
[228:45.69]Oh, who pays you?
[228:49.95]I do.
[228:51.27]I made a lot of money in Bitcoin.
[228:55.73]This was my dream.
[228:56.56]To be able to do this shit.
[229:03.50]Oh, fuck, I don't get it.
[229:06.14]But, uh, that was fun.
[229:07.76]More multiplayer with Star, even though he didn't want to play Pulsar, uh, Economy, whatever it is.
[229:12.69]Disappointed by that, and we had some technical difficulties.
[229:16.49]Star really couldn't really figure out how to get his damn shit going.
[229:21.20]I mean, like, what was that?
[229:24.28]Okay, let's go.
[229:25.82]Looks like it's fixed.
[229:28.85]Sort of.
[229:29.11]I'm sure we'll find out real quickly here.
[229:35.37]So I gotta change the... If there's a mod that has the capability, because I just put this all back on, can somebody change the name of the game to Gorn?
[229:45.58]Grab world.
[229:47.44]Move hand here.
[229:49.60]And then you move back.
[229:53.60]That doesn't seem correct.
[229:55.72]Move hand here.
[229:56.74]Press and hold to grab world.
[229:59.26]And pull world.
[230:00.11]I think the... I have, like, different controls set up.
[230:02.87]I have, like... The pads set up, I think.
[230:07.21]What the fuck was that?
[230:17.62]Okay.
[230:22.97]That was very odd.
[230:24.51]It's fixed.
[230:28.39]It's fixed.
[230:31.71]Yes!
[230:32.07]This is the game everybody wanted me to play so badly, and now I get to actually play it.
[230:35.29]This is the one.
[230:36.63]So, just fight.
[230:57.17]Okay.
[230:58.33]Let's kick that guy's ass.
[231:04.63]What are these emote faces?
[231:11.27]This game is absurdly violent.
[231:12.98]Well, if you're not over the age of 21, don't consume alcoholic beverages.
[231:18.94]Alright, no, this is fixed.
[231:20.42]Let's fucking go.
[231:23.80]This is just main.
[231:25.24]Toggle hold.
[231:25.66]Hold.
[231:27.00]hold gesture is that the only gesture is just middle finger real mature right off the bat well I don't know what this is today have you guys realized this like this is I don't know what this is I've done it like five times today alright let's go
[231:54.95]Gesture hold, toggle hold, so you can like keep that closed.
[231:58.07]That's cool.
[231:59.49]And then you move around.
[232:00.21]Let's go.
[232:00.83]Tier one.
[232:06.49]Streamer tells audience to fuck off.
[232:11.48]When?
[232:12.42]When did I do that?
[232:18.55]When did I do that?
[232:21.13]So toggle hold.
[232:25.85]Okay.
[232:27.85]So is there a quick turn?
[232:34.26]Or do I actually have to turn?
[232:35.52]I think it's I have to actually turn.
[232:36.96]Alright, let's go.
[232:43.71]Alright, done.
[232:45.43]Is there a block or a parry?
[233:00.05]Is this what you want?
[233:00.73]Is this what you want to see?
[233:02.55]This is actually pretty fun.
[233:19.39]Come here.
[233:22.27]Ooh, I just broke his ankle.
[233:24.81]Was that difficult for you?
[233:27.56]How's the audio?
[233:27.94]Do you want to quit?
[233:37.52]If you're not a coward, take up your weapon and salute us.
[233:43.13]Okay.
[233:45.27]How do I... Grab this.
[233:49.43]This is kind of freaking me out a little.
[233:51.04]There we go.
[233:54.84]Is this like a rubber mace?
[233:56.56]Alright, bring it on next wave.
[234:07.95]Still alive?
[234:14.01]Gotta go, you gotta break their arms.
[234:20.89]Holy shit, I just blowed that guy's head.
[234:23.34]Watch out!
[234:35.58]Oh my god, that's terrible.
[234:43.64]You got shin pads?
[234:44.76]Ah, I see, I see, I get you.
[234:47.89]Come on, on the ground.
[234:56.63]Right in the chest.
[235:12.34]Oh, I fucking won!
[235:13.05]This is actually really fun.
[235:14.57]So, is this- do I just have to keep going?
[235:17.47]Shield this time.
[235:18.25]Okay, I want this in my right hand.
[235:21.11]Uh, excuse me.
[235:21.43]What?
[235:21.53]No, pick this up.
[235:21.99]Okay.
[235:44.42]Easy.
[235:44.70]Okay.
[235:47.72]This is a huge shield.
[235:48.92]It's like an umbrella.
[236:00.93]I said I did it back in the medieval times.
[236:06.07]Can I hit myself in the face?
[236:09.07]Oops-a-daisy.
[236:13.63]Easy here.
[236:27.93]Kaba!
[236:31.03]Oh, is this your friend?
[236:32.08]How come these guys don't
[236:46.71]Rip off someone's head?
[236:49.15]Oh, okay, so there's a champion at the end of this.
[236:53.87]I gotta do this.
[236:54.75]Free for all?
[236:55.93]I don't have any... I don't have a weapon!
[236:57.85]Holy fuck!
[237:21.26]Give me your weapon.
[237:29.51]Give me that.
[237:53.41]cord Oh careful as a wall hold on I'm like I'm actually getting stuck Oh God I'm getting close to something I know what I can feel it how many more free-for-all tell what to let everyone's dead
[238:25.98]Well, you can throw shit, too.
[238:28.70]Come here.
[238:29.06]I just fucking Curly, Moe, and Larry, whatever their names are.
[238:40.09]It's pretty punks.
[238:40.99]I did it!
[238:47.99]They are all dead.
[238:50.83]You remain.
[238:52.99]Now your final challenge.
[238:55.31]What's the final challenge?
[238:57.85]Okay.
[238:58.19]Alright, let me get ready here.
[239:00.71]Let me get ready.
[239:01.95]Bring it on!
[239:03.15]Alright, does it get like a goat mask on?
[239:31.83]He ain't gonna be fighting anymore.
[239:34.61]That took his whole arm off.
[239:41.58]That guy was easier than the default enemies.
[239:48.24]I almost just hit the wall.
[239:52.00]It's okay.
[239:53.28]Alright, Achilles General.
[239:58.54]What's Achilles?
[240:03.22]This is easy, soda, the soda, the soda spilled, oh no.
[240:10.25]You're not on camera anymore, you opened the door and walked outside.
[240:19.80]I can see the soda on the table, guys.
[240:22.56]Alright, let's just go, should we go to like tier two?
[240:26.94]How does this work?
[240:28.26]Oh, I can only do tier one.
[240:30.20]I'm just gonna go to Achilles.
[240:38.22]The weapon in front of you is sharp.
[240:41.16]Show us your competence.
[240:43.21]Pick up the sword and salute us.
[240:47.15]This is a rubber sword.
[240:48.19]This isn't a real sword.
[240:49.17]This is a fake sword.
[240:53.17]So we've got slicing action.
[240:56.77]I've got to cut a leg off.
[240:59.31]Oh my god.
[241:01.51]That was actually really cool.
[241:22.38]Holy shit.
[241:25.65]How do I, like, grab... How do I, like, grab and rip somebody's head off?
[241:30.49]Take a bite of your limbs.
[241:36.00]And your head.
[242:02.90]How do I rip his head off?
[242:23.33]How do I do that?
[242:29.69]You're still in one piece
[242:32.93]Well, that was absolutely brutal, but okay.
[242:37.97]Where's the new weapon?
[242:41.03]It's a battleaxe.
[242:44.83]Yes.
[242:45.67]Jesus.
[242:46.15]Yeah, that was pretty insane.
[242:48.62]Two hands?
[242:50.02]No.
[242:55.58]It's a little slower movement on this one, I think.
[242:57.26]Yeah, a little bit.
[243:11.57]Legs.
[243:12.13]Try to sweep underneath.
[243:16.60]Are you... Are you still swinging at me?
[243:26.40]How are you still doing this?
[243:29.70]Oh my god.
[243:34.46]Whoa.
[243:35.46]I took his chin off.
[243:36.54]Shit, he hit me.
[243:50.17]Oh, there's bow and arrows in this game?
[244:01.15]Come here.
[244:04.83]Whatever.
[244:05.89]He's dead.
[244:07.99]Ah, yes.
[244:08.77]You sure know how to hit things.
[244:11.72]Do you fight that guy eventually?
[244:13.00]I'm going to get taught.
[244:14.72]Okay.
[244:15.24]Alright, so we got one.
[244:17.22]We got our little hammer here.
[244:18.24]Alright, let's go for... I'm going to say shoulders.
[244:24.00]Shoulders.
[244:49.01]go club in the head this guy's got he's got plate armor on that's new another weapon something else I can use
[245:33.63]It's kind of hard for me to do two at the same time.
[245:35.75]I'm dead.
[245:37.35]Yeah, do well with this control setup because when you have two weapons, this no longer is like walk.
[245:45.61]So it's hard to do two.
[245:48.93]This is like better for shield for me.
[245:50.13]Because then I have to use this to walk when I swing with this hand.
[245:56.95]It's odd.
[246:06.16]Come here.
[246:35.98]The armor first.
[246:37.14]Nope.
[246:38.08]Just kidding.
[246:38.54]Watch out.
[246:38.86]There's a wall somewhere here.
[246:47.32]I want that axe.
[246:59.09]Hello?
[246:59.43]There we go.
[247:12.38]Anymore?
[247:14.25]This is a soda!
[247:15.41]Okay, what do we got?
[247:18.33]Okay.
[247:18.47]Hmm.
[247:18.63]Hmmmmmm.
[247:48.99]I wasn't a fan of this last time, but I'll try it again.
[247:51.23]See what I mean?
[248:09.43]Like, I can't walk forward.
[248:10.40]Because when I raise my hand up, it's like, you sure you're moving?
[248:13.06]It's not ideal.
[248:19.79]See, when I lift my hand up, even if I'm trying to walk forward, I go backwards.
[248:22.82]So I have to go backwards when I lift my hand up here.
[248:26.30]It's weird.
[248:49.28]Oh shit.
[248:57.90]Come here.
[248:58.62]I don't think so.
[249:12.36]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[249:16.28]Good thing I had the hand scraps on.
[249:18.67]That was a broken glass.
[249:20.09]Something would have shattered.
[249:32.30]Arrows.
[249:41.28]Goodbye.
[249:43.74]Yes!
[249:44.36]Delightful.
[249:48.89]Is there a multiplayer in this game?
[249:50.67]I don't think there is.
[249:55.00]Okay, here comes Achilles.
[249:58.62]Alright, where am I at?
[250:00.08]Ooh.
[250:00.16]Alright, I'm gonna go with just one hand here.
[250:03.40]I'm way better with one hand.
[250:25.69]I see his leg.
[250:26.77]That's why your name is Achilles!
[250:28.09]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[250:35.59]I think that's not throwing shit.
[250:38.91]Oh, what a clever boy.
[250:54.51]Achilles.
[250:55.65]Berserker.
[250:57.45]General.
[251:00.53]Well, we can go to Tier 2.
[251:05.09]What is General?
[251:11.29]Is General just, like, THE General?
[251:21.01]Badgermancer.
[251:23.60]Okay.
[251:23.74]Everybody seems to want to see this one.
[251:28.26]We see you kill and are not entertained.
[251:31.96]You bring no style to it.
[251:34.08]No joy, no laughs.
[251:36.32]Make good use of this spear and salute us.
[251:41.85]This control is... Okay.
[251:46.35]I'm usually... I like spears in these games.
[251:48.05]I'm going to have to move around with the right stick here.
[251:56.62]It's really slippery though.
[252:09.63]I guess I could just swing.
[252:10.49]Nope.
[252:13.47]I need to go the other direction.
[252:20.86]Come here.
[252:24.08]I need to, yeah, I gotta go the other way.
[252:37.98]Alright, you can pick people up, I think.
[252:39.32]Come here!
[252:50.72]What is happening?
[252:52.08]Alright, let go of this.
[252:58.90]I don't want to use this thing anymore.
[253:05.08]That's what I'm talking about.
[253:05.94]That's much better.
[253:15.75]This thing is so tangled.
[253:35.93]Jeremy, you're a sicko!
[253:46.37]Oops-a-daisy.
[253:54.73]That thing looks kind of fun.
[253:59.59]Ooh, I thought you went under.
[254:16.09]I thought he went down.
[254:17.15]Oh, shit.
[254:19.85]Is he dead?
[254:47.56]I'm fucking, I'm ripping his head off.
[254:54.58]Oh, fuck it.
[255:04.45]Oops.
[255:06.45]What, what?
[255:08.27]It got bumped into my thing?
[255:09.89]Open it up.
[255:16.69]One.
[255:28.40]Two.
[255:30.11]Three.
[255:30.93]Oops-a-daisy.
[255:31.65]That didn't work.
[255:33.37]That did not work like I intended it to.
[255:35.19]Ugh.
[255:44.29]Oh, this goddamn controller.
[255:47.69]I'm gonna die.
[255:56.26]No, I'm dead.
[255:57.72]Oh, I'm exhausted.
[256:02.60]I really wish it... Okay, so this is the worst part.
[256:06.52]Ready?
[256:07.26]I'm moving forward.
[256:08.68]Now I'm moving backwards.
[256:10.36]It doesn't matter, I'm holding here.
[256:12.10]Now we're going this way.
[256:13.44]I wish it was just forward.
[256:14.60]Because now I have to go, I have to switch to back.
[256:17.68]It's literally, it's just whatever direction the trackpad is in.
[256:21.56]I'd rather just have this be forward.
[256:24.40]Alright.
[256:29.45]Will you stop?
[256:34.67]Bring him on!
[257:12.38]Yeah, crap!
[257:42.35]Oh, I can do that too.
[257:48.92]Oh, trying to do a cool move.
[258:04.64]I'm trying to throw him in the air.
[258:09.63]What's that?
[258:09.87]That guy with the t-shirt on?
[258:14.29]There we go.
[258:16.73]Oh.
[258:19.54]That guy just almost did the look of me.
[258:21.24]Just close.
[258:22.18]One, two, three.
[258:43.82]Is this it?
[258:44.46]Last guy?
[258:48.90]Come here.
[258:54.90]This is fucking so much fun.
[258:59.47]Spikes?
[259:00.13]Oh, shit.
[259:02.23]Those are spikes.
[259:05.29]What are those?
[259:07.59]What is on me?
[259:10.87]I have, like, Spider-Man grips?
[259:25.44]Wait a minute, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, give me, give me, give me, give me that back!
[259:34.18]They're like boomerangs?
[259:41.39]Okay, that's... really cool.
[259:52.35]Holy shit.
[260:01.64]It's too much!
[260:02.22]No!
[260:05.16]Those things are really fun.
[260:16.02]I'm running out of gas, so I'm not gonna lie.
[260:32.01]I'm running out of gas.
[260:32.71]I didn't have very much left in the tank when I opened this.
[260:39.60]That's a good technique.
[260:40.48]Just thunderclap.
[260:45.76]I gotta throw somebody into the spikes at least once before I leave.
[261:14.93]Jesus, it worked.
[261:16.15]Something about humor escapes you.
[261:45.73]Alright, I'm gonna kill I'm killing the badger guy and I'm gonna I'm done I've used all my fuel This game is fucking awesome though
[262:15.58]That guy don't matter.
[262:16.22]We'll take care of this guy first.
[262:17.42]He's like eyes just popped out of his head.
[262:24.69]I got this guy's like juice on me.
[262:36.49]The people are stuck.
[262:45.00]I'm hyper-release.
[262:46.28]He's still on me.
[263:24.60]Too many movement games today.
[263:32.07]The climbing game, the run around shoot game.
[263:34.53]Just been exercising for four hours.
[263:42.05]I'm running on a treadmill for four hours.
[264:01.23]Right in his head.
[264:07.93]Ooh.
[264:10.45]I want the bow.
[264:11.13]Let me try the bow.
[264:12.14]How does this work?
[264:36.80]I'm going to use this.
[264:47.23]No, get me.
[264:54.62]Oh, that didn't go very far.
[264:55.90]No, not good.
[264:57.12]Give me something else.
[265:13.51]I hate that control scheme, it's gonna make me scream.
[265:15.86]I hope, can I change that?
[265:42.13]Funny?
[265:42.25]We're going to get a comedy level?
[265:44.45]A little stabber?
[266:11.94]Huh?
[266:50.98]Come here.
[266:52.99]You can pick him up and you can ski with him.
[266:54.41]That's amazing.
[267:03.61]See you later.
[267:15.89]Oh, that fits so good.
[267:30.82]Your arm is not doing so well.
[267:34.34]Come here.
[267:56.08]Goodbye.
[267:56.46]Alright, boss time after this, right?
[268:06.61]Dead?
[268:19.46]What?
[268:20.86]What?
[268:22.98]What happened there?
[268:26.26]I don't understand.
[268:31.28]What was hitting me?
[268:31.96]There was nobody else behind me.
[268:41.45]You have to kill somebody to live.
[268:42.85]Man, that would have hit me once and I feel like I shouldn't have died there.
[268:57.18]Is it like a fast kill for these things?
[269:00.78]This thing's like five
[269:33.69]I like this thing way better.
[269:35.39]Mmm, that feels good.
[269:37.61]Alright, watch out for the wall.
[269:41.04]I got fuckin' incinerated.
[270:15.42]Hello?
[270:15.76]Why does it just have its mind of its own?
[270:32.69]It was an earbud.
[270:47.75]That's it?
[270:53.79]You struggled so much.
[270:55.59]Very funny.
[270:57.93]Delay.
[270:58.53]Drink him.
[270:59.28]Our champion.
[271:02.18]He is master of pranks and brings vicious pets.
[271:09.78]Lift your hand and challenge the Badgermancer.
[271:13.60]Badgermancer.
[271:14.50]Here it comes.
[271:16.38]Let's go.
[271:26.04]Do I get a weapon?
[271:26.74]Alright.
[271:37.50]Do they come after me?
[272:03.02]What's going on?
[272:05.04]What's happening?
[272:05.72]Who's eating?
[272:06.30]Is it eating?
[272:07.62]Why is it still giving me a chance?
[272:08.94]Let's go.
[272:12.79]I'm gonna go kick the shit out of him.
[272:20.23]Let's go beat his face in.
[272:24.24]Where's the wall?
[272:25.24]I'm gonna get fucking hurt.
[272:44.55]I DID IT!
[272:49.80]I did it.
[272:57.44]Yeah, I gotta stop.
[273:00.09]I ran out of fucking fuel 40 minutes ago.
[273:02.87]Jesus Christ.
[273:14.97]You get special weapons after you beat the bosses.
[273:16.43]That's actually really fun.
[273:20.45]You had grappling hooks the whole time that you didn't use.
[273:24.37]Oh well.
[273:30.26]But that was a ton of fun.
[273:32.64]Oh, VR is just too much fun.
[273:35.14]I wish I had just more stamina.
[273:42.86]End of the Badger Mansford voice.
[273:48.31]Imagine the smell.
[273:49.13]I don't smell.
[273:49.95]I smell fine.
[273:50.47]That was a lot of fun.
[273:57.41]Let me take this off.
[274:01.56]Turn this off.
[274:04.14]And I will see you guys on the next stream.
[274:08.70]You can change the control screen.
[274:10.20]Yeah, I'll have to do that.
[274:14.15]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[274:15.41]I think the next time you guys are going to see me is Wednesday.
[274:23.88]And we might... I want to play more.
[274:32.70]Two days.
[274:33.42]Oh, no.
[274:33.82]Not next Wednesday.
[274:34.90]No, I mean like in two days.
[274:39.74]Going's a lot of fun.
[274:40.46]I might have to come back and play it.
[274:41.64]I have to beat... Okay, we're going to do a VR night where I complete the... games that I didn't beat.
[274:56.31]And Mind Show 2, I know.
[274:58.97]This is what he experiences.
[275:00.63]The thing with Mindshow though is Mindshow should be a pretty... I don't think I'll play that for like three to four hours.
[275:05.64]I feel like I could do that for a while because it's not a whole lot of like fucking jumping around and like running and breathing and up, down, up, down, twist, twist, twist.
[275:19.97]But thank you everybody.
[275:20.75]I'll see you in a couple days.
[275:22.35]Like always, these streams are a fucking ton of fun.
[275:25.49]Playing with Star was a lot of fun.
[275:29.47]The last two days of co-op have been fucking hilarious and stressful and fun.
[275:35.64]So, it's been great.
[275:37.98]Thank you, everybody.
[275:39.84]I will see you all real soon.
[275:41.30]Take care of yourselves.
[275:42.48]Stick around for the bits if you want to.
[275:47.49]What am I going to do on Wednesday?
[275:48.53]I don't know.
[275:52.27]There's a...
[275:54.69]I could dedicate Wednesday to Mindshow or I might put the VR away for like another like three or four streams still gonna play I guess my Space Channel 5 Seaman we still have that that's been kicking around for a while Ace Attorney trilogy comes out on the 10th of April yeah
[276:23.84]Oh man, oh man.
[276:26.90]There's a lot to do.
[276:29.45]Stupid Invaders disc one, you know, it's true.
[276:32.43]Let's get the outro going here.
[276:45.29]Yeah, a lot of people have been watching these streams.
[276:51.86]I'm very happy that people are liking them.
[276:54.96]There's been a lot of positive feedback on the VR stream, so I'm really happy.
[277:00.72]I'm glad it can be fun.
[277:07.08]It's a very enjoyable experience, I think.
[277:09.66]At least for me.
[277:10.32]Hopefully for you, too.
[277:14.90]Do Onward?
[277:17.02]Yeah, we'll have to do it.
[277:18.56]I have it now, so it's time to do a bunch of it.
[277:25.28]Let me close out of this.
[277:31.29]Finish Dreadhalls?
[277:32.23]Yeah, we'll do like a finish the game stream.
[277:35.51]Not necessarily on Wednesday, but...
[277:38.62]I'm not sure.
[277:38.92]I'll be around.
[277:39.44]I'll be around in the Discord.
[277:40.30]I'll be around in the chat here in like a day or so.
[277:45.99]We'll talk about what we're going to do.
[277:50.91]But I am pooped, as they say.
[278:01.54]Let's head back a little earlier, a few hours ago, about four and a half hours ago.
[278:10.97]Where do we start here?
[278:14.47]Over here, I think.
[278:20.63]Yeah, right there.
[278:22.82]Thank you to Divis five hours ago for the 250.
[278:27.08]Appreciate it.
[278:30.46]Also, thank you to Bake Me Home for the 250.
[278:35.36]You can set SteamVR to show your IRL surroundings if you get close to a wall.
[278:40.68]Yeah, it's already there.
[278:41.52]I have the blue thing set up.
[278:44.52]But when you get heated, you get in the moment.
[278:46.87]It's so hard.
[278:49.29]Because you're focused on what's happening in the game.
[278:53.21]And even with the blue bars, it can be very, very hard to avoid them.
[279:00.88]Where's my chat?
[279:03.94]Oh, there they are.
[279:10.44]No, it straight shows your room, not just the blue bars.
[279:14.95]Oh, really?
[279:17.57]It shows the room?
[279:20.43]That's weird.
[279:23.88]It's just a learn thing.
[279:24.68]The longer you play VR, you sort of remember your space better, but accents still happen.
[279:31.05]It's a lot of fun.
[279:33.96]Frodi and Weapon, thanks for the $5, jermaJex, jermaJex2.
[279:36.76]There was like, there were two or three Jex moments tonight.
[279:43.02]There were at least seven or eight John moments.
[279:47.14]And there was probably 30 Jeremy moments.
[279:52.96]So, it balances out, I think.
[279:55.79]Is there a top 10 Jerma screaming clips from this stream?
[280:00.87]I don't think there's very much screaming.
[280:03.79]No, that was... that was a few days ago.
[280:08.61]This wasn't a Scream stream.
[280:10.51]This was like a try-hard shooter stream.
[280:22.14]Like Star was saying before, imagine Pavlov VR in a competitive LAN setup.
[280:31.25]And they're all up there, like game show contestants hooked up to different helmets instead of computers.
[280:37.37]That'd be wild.
[280:43.31]And then if they die, there's like a trap door that opens on it and they like... They fall out of their VR headsets and go through the trap door.
[280:54.48]But thank you to... Uh... The Nintendo PlayStation...
[281:02.30]for the $5 here.
[281:04.52]Been watching you for a long time since TF2 2014.
[281:06.04]Uh, thank you.
[281:06.84]Really appreciate it.
[281:10.50]And you're currently playing Homeworld 2.
[281:15.66]Homeworld 2.
[281:18.29]With like a Star Wars mod?
[281:22.93]They had Star Wars mods for Homeworld?
[281:25.17]That's kind of insane.
[281:30.19]But thank you, Nintendo PlayStation, for the $5 here.
[281:32.37]Or actually, $7 here, $7.50.
[281:35.73]And they say the heavy machine gun you use is an MK-48.
[281:41.61]The gun appears in so many games, like Black Ops 2, and it's even in GTA 4.
[281:50.32]The huge one, yeah.
[281:53.34]That gun is in, like, every game, isn't it?
[281:59.95]That fold-out, like, futon gun.
[282:04.21]I call that thing, that's a futon.
[282:05.89]It's just a huge fold-out machine gun.
[282:17.20]Uh, Broluck!
[282:18.78]Thank you for the $2.50.
[282:19.32]Don't know if you've seen this yet.
[282:21.10]I'm not sure.
[282:21.70]I'll tell you about it.
[282:22.78]Hello, Moto.
[282:25.86]Hello, Moto.
[282:26.72]Ringtone for one hour.
[282:30.92]I have not seen this.
[282:31.74]I'm not sure why I would want to see this.
[282:42.74]Hello, MotoRing.
[283:10.13]Hello, Moto.
[283:44.70]you
[284:14.43]Oh shit, I've been like talking this whole time.
[284:20.22]I don't know why that muted.
[284:22.32]He's stuck in the... What was the last thing you heard me say?
[284:26.45]Motorola?
[284:29.13]Oh, God.
[284:29.51]Well, I said... I talked about... DReggieDeddy gave me $3 and wrote something about a flamethrower that's an RPG combined.
[284:41.32]It's like a plasma in the gun.
[284:42.82]And it's a link to... I don't even know what it is.
[284:47.48]It's a weird-looking little gun thing.
[284:50.91]You were just playing the music and nothing else.
[284:54.57]We just heard the music.
[284:56.23]Oh.
[284:57.25]I'm tired.
[284:57.77]I don't know.
[284:59.84]Yeah, here's... This is what it looks like, apparently.
[285:04.25]I have no idea.
[285:13.99]Uh, thank you CoreMonster for the $15.
[285:15.51]That was a load of fun.
[285:20.40]I was bargain binned with the pink avatar.
[285:22.62]Hope you can do this another time.
[285:23.64]I was looking forward to this shit and it did not disappoint.
[285:30.00]Yeah, thank you.
[285:32.66]Glad to have people participate if they can.
[285:37.02]Sometimes it's hard to do.
[285:37.88]It can be tricky sometimes with the amount of people that show up to streams.
[285:45.00]But I like to do community stuff when I can.
[285:47.59]Involve people if they want to play.
[285:51.55]But thank you for the $15.
[285:52.43]Appreciate it.
[285:56.81]Glad you had fun.
[285:57.83]Because it was fun.
[286:00.01]I might not be the best VR shooter, but I tried.
[286:04.15]Thank you again Core Monster for the $15.
[286:08.79]Uh, thank you also to Nintendo PlayStation for... $12 here.
[286:23.28]And they say, uh... I have an idea, get VR Troopers.
[286:27.71]It's a better headset.
[286:31.37]I disagree.
[286:32.73]I disagree.
[286:35.64]But thank you, though.
[286:39.38]And then we also had... And then they said, I'm going sicko.
[286:42.32]Sicko.
[286:43.66]I didn't do very well for a lot of those.
[286:52.56]Once you get into it, though, there was a few rounds of the gun game where I was really feeling it.
[286:57.57]I could just feel the weight.
[287:00.35]I was pretending.
[287:03.17]You move around.
[287:04.01]You have to actually move your arms.
[287:08.56]I came into fourth place one of those times.
[287:13.62]Sick Jex.
[287:20.54]Sicko Mode is a great song, but the meme is getting very old at this point.
[287:25.80]I don't even know what it is.
[287:31.14]Poor Boomer has to do physical exercise.
[287:33.64]Oh, phew, woe is me.
[287:35.78]I had to get up and move for four and a half hours.
[287:45.07]And then also we had the Jewish Bro came in with about $4 here.
[287:53.94]Could you play Seaman and more shitty games on Wednesday?
[287:56.54]VR is fun, but let's go back to the basics.
[288:01.46]Yeah, but I... Look, I'm of the opinion if I'm having a good time, I'm going to keep having a good time.
[288:08.37]Alright?
[288:10.94]I definitely don't want to do exclusively only VR but it is a brand new toy I was tired after just the pavlov match that's a lot of exertion and Jerma did climbing and going today and before climbing star's computer broke in the chef game and he plans to go to the furry convention in Chicago yeah I'll be there
[288:45.19]Just kidding.
[288:47.39]I think they say, can you pull an all-nighter and see how long you last?
[288:52.25]No, I'm not... I don't stream all night.
[288:57.86]I can't do that.
[289:01.52]Let's get the credits going up, too.
[289:03.98]All the new subs and the resubs.
[289:05.08]Thank you, guys.
[289:08.62]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[289:11.19]In his rat costume?
[289:12.11]No, in his frog costume.
[289:14.48]Just want to make sure everyone's really clear.
[289:16.14]Frog.
[289:16.48]Okay.
[289:18.56]Oh, is he a rat?
[289:19.72]Is he a... Maybe he's a fox.
[289:24.12]Nope.
[289:25.12]Frog.
[289:28.18]If I had to pick.
[289:30.60]Frogs don't have fur.
[289:32.02]That doesn't matter.
[289:34.83]Could be a froggy.
[289:37.99]Why do you enable them?
[289:39.15]Because it's fun.
[289:50.97]And we had Bingo Sunshine for $5.
[289:52.83]Thank you, Bingo.
[289:54.79]Whoops, you missed that one.
[289:56.57]Try another VR stream.
[290:11.12]Okay, then.
[290:11.88]I'll be a penguin.
[290:12.90]See you there.
[290:20.50]Someone's gonna edit that clip and just cut out you saying, just kidding.
[290:25.56]Well, people have their... The internet's a powerful place.
[290:31.17]I've said this before.
[290:33.35]Think of how many sentences I've said.
[290:37.41]Being recorded on a microphone.
[290:39.75]I have said every single word.
[290:42.67]If you were dedicated enough, you could make an entire audiobook of me saying anything you wanted over the course of like four or five hundred pages.
[290:54.73]You could make anything.
[290:58.20]You could write a whole book and have me be the narrator with different clips.
[291:09.39]You could just make an AI to view your videos and recreate you in your entirety.
[291:13.79]Yeah.
[291:18.23]So... Look, I haven't said every word.
[291:22.29]Relax.
[291:36.40]I see my name.
[291:45.41]Time to watch every Jerma stream and make sure he said every single word.
[292:09.68]Streamer lies.
[292:11.02]Jiggle it a little.
[292:11.84]It'll open.
[292:14.57]Oh my god.
[292:18.12]I've never swore on stream.
[292:20.36]Yes, I have.
[292:20.98]I think I swore... Every, like, eight minutes today.
[292:33.53]You've never said... No, I'm not saying any words.
[292:39.32]But the next time I see you guys...
[292:43.51]We'll be on Wednesday.
[292:44.21]Have a nice relaxing start to your week.
[292:47.83]Thank you for joining me on the VR stuff last couple of days.
[292:51.51]And we did VR three days ago too, right?
[292:53.63]Four days ago?
[292:59.60]Thanks everybody again for hanging out.
[293:02.18]Hope you have a good time.
[293:05.85]Take care, everybody.
[293:06.81]And Nintendo PlayStation with $2.50 right at the end.
[293:09.12]Hey, Jerma, can you say... Like, no.
[293:12.86]I'm not going to say the thing from... I almost said Breaking Bad.
[293:17.22]No.
[293:17.52]What's that show with the nerds?
[293:19.44]It's like a nerd show.
[293:22.78]Earth?
[293:23.24]It's called like... We're at the Earth.
[293:26.42]The Big Bang.
[293:31.16]Yeah.
[293:31.58]I don't want to say the Sheldon catchphrase.
[293:38.16]But I'll see you guys soon.
[293:39.62]Take care.
[293:42.54]Have a nice one.
[293:44.12]And goodbye.
[293:46.90]Eat your vegetables.
[293:48.60]And drink your fucking water.
[293:50.10]Like, I'm gonna go down water right now.
[293:53.26]See you later, guys.
[294:12.39]Thank you.
