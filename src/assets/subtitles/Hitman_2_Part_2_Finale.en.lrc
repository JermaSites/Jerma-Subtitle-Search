[00:01.14]Hey.
[00:02.72]How's it going?
[00:05.12]Turn up the volume.
[00:07.65]I have this at a reasonable decibel level, I believe.
[00:11.47]How you guys doing?
[00:14.83]Just making a tweet.
[00:18.01]Sorry, I didn't start where I wanted to about 30-40 minutes ago.
[00:22.47]One of my webcams was blue-screening the computer.
[00:26.78]I have no idea why.
[00:29.97]I have two webcams.
[00:32.67]Remember the Labo stream from this past weekend?
[00:37.79]I mean, they were both... All the things I read about saying that, oh, when you open up OBS and you have two webcams enabled, it blue screens, but I wasn't having that problem before.
[00:46.88]I don't know if there was like a stealth update to the Logitech software.
[00:50.30]I have no idea.
[00:52.01]But apparently one of these was just causing the driver to crash and blue-screening the whole computer.
[00:57.70]But hey, I think I fixed it.
[00:58.88]We're good.
[00:59.90]Hasn't happened yet, so that's good.
[01:03.72]So let's see.
[01:04.16]Seeing the sights in Hitman 2.
[01:05.50]Yeah, because that means I haven't seen it before.
[01:11.84]It could be anything, you know?
[01:12.74]It could be whatever.
[01:15.50]Seeing the sights in Hitman 2.
[01:16.78]That sounds pretty good to me.
[01:22.57]All right.
[01:24.13]So, yeah, we're going to just, we got to the halfway point last night.
[01:28.77]And I would assume, judging by we did three areas last night, I'm going to assume that we've got three more here that will take us to the end.
[01:41.30]Now, that does not mean this is the end of Hitman streams.
[01:45.86]This is talking about the end of the campaign.
[01:47.52]Technically.
[01:48.64]Because there's a whole lot of shit to do.
[01:50.68]And by the end of this stream, we will gauge whether or not I do it again.
[01:55.83]And I will go back.
[01:56.61]We'll play some other contracts.
[01:59.29]We'll do some other campaign missions.
[02:01.91]But for the purpose of this story, we're going to be done, I think, today.
[02:06.77]Put some clothes on.
[02:07.73]I have... Listen.
[02:08.75]Listen.
[02:10.79]No, I gotta turn this off, so you can hear it.
[02:15.19]Ready?
[02:19.47]See?
[02:19.87]And then... I got clothes on.
[02:25.16]There!
[02:25.96]Whoa, that was wicked loud!
[02:26.94]Why was it so loud?
[02:29.02]The cannon vocal cords, just, what was that?
[02:31.30]It was like... So, here we are, where we were last time.
[02:38.59]I don't know why that was so loud.
[02:41.61]So we got Hitman 2.
[02:42.41]I don't know what this is.
[02:47.49]So Mission Nightcrawler did it.
[02:48.91]Blank check.
[02:49.75]Cinematic.
[02:51.71]Let's go through our Microsoft Windows tiles.
[02:55.89]Chasing a ghost.
[02:57.02]And a ghost.
[02:59.02]And here we go.
[02:59.52]Mission Another Life.
[03:01.88]This is where we left off.
[03:04.30]This is like spoilers.
[03:06.40]Why is it showing this to me?
[03:09.38]Another life.
[03:12.22]But we're not going to do it yet.
[03:13.76]And I know the audio is not on.
[03:17.32]I'm well aware of it.
[03:19.64]Stop looking.
[03:23.38]But let's let people trickle in while I talk about one other important thing.
[03:29.02]The green screen stream is slated and scheduled for tomorrow.
[03:34.84]The thing is, though, I don't have a time yet.
[03:38.04]Because it's... I'm kind of... I'm working with a studio, so I need to get, like, a time from them?
[03:45.65]I think it might just be kind of whenever.
[03:47.85]Whenever I can start.
[03:50.23]So, I don't necessarily have a direct, exact time.
[03:56.40]But I will make sure to tweet either later tonight or tomorrow afternoon in the time that it's going to happen.
[04:03.36]An estimate?
[04:04.14]I would probably say around the normal start time, what it's been for the last couple of weeks.
[04:08.83]That's at least when I would like to do it.
[04:10.79]So... It might be a little earlier than that, considering I might... I want to get in there early and get everything set up, so...
[04:18.43]The rough estimate is probably going to be between, like, 4, like, 3 and 6 Eastern Time, PM.
[04:28.33]Maybe pull it back a little bit earlier than that.
[04:30.49]Between, like, 2 and 5, maybe, Eastern.
[04:35.05]I don't, I just don't know.
[04:36.35]I don't have that time from the studio yet.
[04:37.95]So I know that I am there for what's called a, you can either do half days or full days in a studio.
[04:44.64]And I believe I'm on a half day.
[04:48.24]So I think that means probably from like nine in the morning or 10 in the morning to like four in the afternoon Pacific.
[04:58.40]So I don't know.
[04:59.94]I don't know.
[05:02.16]But
[05:03.27]Let's go.
[05:03.61]I just want to give an update on that because and if something something if something crazy happens Or if it changes I'll make sure to let you guys know on Twitter You know what?
[05:11.24]Just follow me on Twitter!
[05:12.58]Twitter.tv slash Jerp.
[05:14.20]Let's go over the plan.
[05:15.10]I thought the computer broke.
[05:15.80]The first constant is none other than Janus, the legendary Cold War spy master.
[05:22.54]A KGB senior officer and head of the sixth column special branch at Lubyanka, Janus is a certified genius and expert of counterintelligence.
[05:32.67]He retired from the KGB in 1988 when he fell out of favor with the Kremlin and defected to the US.
[05:38.89]Shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed.
[05:42.17]Now, it is unclear when Janus stepped down as the constant, but since 2004, he has been a resident of a poor community in suburban Vermont.
[05:51.14]Mr. Gray.
[05:51.88]Right, so here's the catch.
[05:53.90]As an elite KGB agent, Janus was trained to withstand interrogation and torture.
[05:59.02]No amount of pressure will force him to disclose information he doesn't want to.
[06:03.61]Instead, we will need to search his home for clues.
[06:07.15]But if Providence learns of our presence, the game is up.
[06:11.37]So reframe Janus.
[06:13.23]Make Providence think he was the real Shadow Clan.
[06:17.29]Correct.
[06:17.75]I will file a false ICA report, claiming to have traced a number of calls from Janus's house to the Institute in Romania.
[06:25.34]The case will seem clear.
[06:26.72]Mr. Grey was only a figurehead.
[06:28.90]Janus was pulling the strings all along.
[06:31.42]And by eliminating him, we will have neutralized the militia once and for all.
[06:37.25]However, for this sub to fuse to work, you'll also need to deal with Janus's security detail.
[06:43.03]I can take care of that.
[06:43.73]A Providence Herald and former Secret Service agent by the name of Nolan Cassidy.
[06:48.77]Intel describes him as diligent and inquisitive, and we cannot risk that he contradicts our story to his employer.
[06:57.18]Seems workable.
[06:58.88]So, they did a similar mission like this in Hitman 2.
[07:10.43]What is going on with my framerate?
[07:14.77]I am... I don't know.
[07:18.34]It's only, like, in that cutscene.
[07:23.02]Is it Hitman 2 or is it Blood Money?
[07:24.56]Where you kind of have to go into the guy's house.
[07:31.01]So I gotta get rid of these two.
[07:31.97]Alright, let's take a look at our planning stage here.
[07:36.45]We got Littleton Creek.
[07:48.50]Ooh, I got the Silver Baller this time.
[07:50.80]Master Card.
[07:52.42]Master Crafted.
[07:55.62]Well, I mean, I just unlocked it, so I have to use it, right?
[08:01.51]Suburban suit.
[08:06.78]I mean, I... I guess you're just wearing a suit.
[08:09.90]Should I... Why can't... I should be, like, a jogger.
[08:21.57]What is... Icy?
[08:22.37]Oh, that's icy.
[08:23.09]Okay.
[08:24.23]Uh... I can do remotes, fragments, sedative pills, coins...
[08:30.40]No, give me the lockpick.
[08:32.21]I'll take the fish, but I'm taking the lockpick.
[08:34.15]I'm not doing, like, the duck again.
[08:35.61]It didn't serve any purpose besides just throwing it into fucking random objectives.
[08:44.25]Alright, looks good.
[08:45.91]So, gotta get rid of Janice and get rid of Mr. Cassidy.
[08:51.29]And now you gotta find clues.
[08:53.41]I'm ready.
[08:59.07]Oh, so somebody chatted.
[09:00.45]What are you drinking tonight?
[09:01.59]What's that?
[09:04.03]Random chatter?
[09:04.95]I'll tell you.
[09:06.09]So that, it's a... I ran out of bananas.
[09:09.65]And I ran out of the things that I would put in here besides.
[09:13.58]It's just peanut butter and almond milk blended up hard.
[09:17.30]I'm just drinking peanut butter right now.
[09:18.80]It's enough to, like, it's a sustainable... Just, like, sustains me.
[09:22.28]On the surface, a picture-perfect suburban dream.
[09:26.38]Wide roads...
[09:27.61]golden maple trees and verdant lawns.
[09:30.69]Most residents here are white-collar professionals, ranging from university staff to government employees.
[09:37.26]So it runs fine now.
[09:38.08]Most, but not all.
[09:41.22]Janus's unpresuming home is protected by a host of bodyguards, and intel shows that the fragile former constant rarely leaves the property.
[09:52.09]And he buys weed off the local paper route kid.
[09:54.81]Okay.
[10:17.77]So this just... This is not just one house.
[10:20.48]This is just the whole neighborhood.
[10:27.76]Okay, let's see.
[10:31.18]And you know, speaking of sustainability...
[10:35.80]Oh, oh, this is not good.
[10:36.70]Shift and shift.
[10:37.24]This is doing this.
[10:38.10]Alright, so I gotta be careful here.
[10:39.08]Thanks.
[10:39.24]Alright, so, let's see what we got here.
[10:40.36]No entry.
[10:40.76]Don't tell me what to do.
[10:41.30]Oh, this is a yard sale.
[10:42.00]This is one of those novelty signs you put in your college dorm room.
[10:43.94]In front of the door.
[10:44.38]That's cool.
[11:06.82]I'm not a hero.
[11:13.54]Wouldn't these things blow over the... Yeah, they are blowing the leaves.
[11:15.64]There he is.
[11:16.14]Yeah, well, he's not doing a very good job.
[11:18.97]He's going to the fucking college guy yard sale.
[11:22.25]Blending as a garbage man.
[11:24.21]Hey, hold on.
[11:24.55]Where are they going?
[11:43.28]Everything to spec here?
[11:44.50]Did you pass the latest tapes over to the house?
[11:46.16]Yes, sir.
[11:46.74]I did.
[11:47.02]They're in a pile and are ready for review.
[11:49.40]All right.
[11:49.85]We need a better setup.
[11:51.05]It's not ideal recording things from up there and then storing the tapes somewhere else.
[11:55.79]I totally agree, sir.
[11:57.29]Though separating the tapes from the playback device is necessary in case someone gains access to the building.
[12:02.39]As you mentioned yourself.
[12:03.39]They're talking.
[12:04.29]We can't let anyone know.
[12:05.53]This is like a bait.
[12:06.21]They're talking.
[12:06.59]You don't have to tell me that.
[12:07.97]I know what I said.
[12:09.38]Of course, Mr. Cassidy.
[12:10.52]I'm sorry.
[12:11.16]No, no, no.
[12:13.08]All right.
[12:20.93]Interesting.
[12:23.85]So they're recording in the tapes.
[12:26.03]The recording devices in the tapes are a different location.
[12:28.03]Let me just keep looking around.
[12:30.33]It's like a birthday party back here.
[12:38.34]Burlington Morgans.
[12:42.52]Are you allowed to go in people's houses?
[12:48.53]Where's the mission?
[13:19.38]Am I allowed to be in here?
[13:20.69]I just opened up somebody's house.
[13:29.35]I haven't seen you before.
[13:30.99]Who are you?
[13:31.81]This guy is something else.
[13:33.91]Is he like your boyfriend or something?
[13:36.51]Hold it right there.
[13:41.08]Oh, that's a party.
[13:42.06]That's a party.
[13:45.64]Is this like your boyfriend or something?
[13:48.94]He's not gonna drink that, is he?
[13:52.42]Wait, you're not gonna drink that, are you?
[14:33.87]Back in the day, Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive and keep memorabilia If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something interesting
[14:49.31]Oh, shit.
[14:54.63]No, no, I can't.
[14:56.69]I can't do it.
[14:58.01]I can't.
[14:58.87]I'm not gonna do it.
[15:01.33]I can't.
[15:02.79]I can't do that.
[15:05.09]Oh, god damn it.
[15:07.60]Alright.
[15:26.50]Whittleton Creek, Vermont.
[15:28.77]On the surface, a picture-perfect suburban dream.
[15:32.89]Wide roads, gold- Alright, I'm ready.
[15:43.83]I'm sorry.
[15:44.89]I didn't want to do that.
[15:49.83]I just ran a simulation.
[15:51.62]I have to see every possibility.
[15:55.58]What's that movie where the guy can see every possibility?
[15:58.22]Doctor Strange.
[16:00.10]I need to see every possibility to find out which one is the right one.
[16:02.92]My head's going all over the place.
[16:05.31]I'm making different facial expressions and shit.
[16:09.50]I needed to see what was possible.
[16:11.14]Let's go over there.
[16:13.34]Yeah, that was not the correct timeline.
[16:20.37]I just... But I saw the timeline.
[16:23.39]In fact, we're going to go to the party.
[16:24.59]Because I feel like that's interesting to look at.
[16:26.13]I did the Doctor Strange and... No.
[16:32.41]See, right now I'm currently sitting on the rock...
[16:36.37]I'm sitting there as Doctor Strange.
[16:38.57]This is how long it took him, guys.
[16:42.29]Like he had to see it all.
[16:43.25]He had to see every possibility and he had to live it.
[16:45.95]That's what I'm doing right now until I find the right one.
[16:54.54]That's not a spoiler.
[16:56.28]Doctor Strange like sits on a rock is not a spoiler.
[17:00.46]Where does he sit?
[17:01.30]Ooh.
[17:01.38]Microfilm viewer.
[17:28.85]This is her party?
[17:29.84]Oh, I will.
[17:30.20]Every soon.
[17:30.88]Hmm.
[17:42.61]Janus next door collects all kinds of ancient memorabilia.
[17:46.07]He might have a roll or tape or whatever it is that sort of thing uses.
[17:51.23]I'm sure he'd be delighted to lend you some.
[17:53.09]The Rock is in the new Avengers movie.
[17:55.20]Sure.
[17:55.68]Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive and keep memorabilia.
[18:00.10]If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something interesting.
[18:03.92]Okay.
[18:05.62]So, locate the microfilm is the next part.
[18:08.58]So, let's see.
[18:11.90]If Janus has any microfilm in his house, it's bound to contain something interesting.
[18:15.79]I'm assuming that's probably one of these.
[18:18.37]An apple a day, breadcrumb trail, charbroiled, a house for sale, no smoking, pest control, and whack-a-mole.
[18:25.02]Not yet.
[18:26.14]Not yet.
[18:35.02]Let's save it right here in case I drown somebody.
[18:44.10]Sabotage the... Oh, I need a screwdriver.
[18:46.42]Just pretend to be the waiter.
[18:47.78]Excuse me, sir.
[18:49.14]Sir, would you like some cracked pepper?
[18:51.46]Let me do that for you.
[19:05.80]No offense, but your breath smells like a gerbil crawled up your ass and died.
[19:09.76]Hmm.
[19:10.92]Kill that guy.
[19:14.08]That was just... Come on, man.
[19:17.29]Yeah, maybe in a few weeks.
[19:29.97]No offense, but... Oh, man.
[19:33.97]Hold on, wait a second.
[19:37.56]Can I push him into the grill?
[19:40.78]I can't.
[19:41.64]I can't push him into the grill.
[19:47.64]That's so unfortunate.
[20:02.71]Oh, the propane tank's not even on.
[20:05.72]I need a propane tank.
[20:12.16]Let's keep looking around back here.
[20:13.52]This is like a little party.
[20:16.64]Fire extinguisher.
[20:17.94]Alright, let me install that for you.
[20:22.60]Oh, this thing uses gas?
[20:24.95]Oh, shit.
[20:40.73]I can't pick this log.
[20:41.78]I'm just gonna go around.
[20:46.44]Somebody's birthday.
[20:47.08]Alright, is this open?
[20:48.92]Far less eyeballs over here.
[20:51.40]I think I could get it.
[20:53.04]Let's try it.
[20:58.86]Got it.
[21:00.93]Okay, this is the Griswold property.
[21:02.73]Hey, did you grab the pack of smokes that was thrown over the fence from the old guy's garden?
[21:07.45]No, ma'am.
[21:08.28]I'm trying to stop.
[21:09.42]Ah, well.
[21:10.24]You know, I think someone in there is trying to help the old geezer stop as well.
[21:14.20]By throwing his coffin nails over the fence?
[21:16.64]What?
[21:16.82]It's pointless.
[21:18.00]There's no reason for him to kick the habit when he's already so close to kicking the fence.
[21:21.58]So, Janeless smokes despite being dependent on an oxygen tank and his bodyguard's insistence on hiding his cigarettes.
[21:29.40]I wonder what might happen if he combined the two.
[21:33.03]Ooh.
[21:36.11]Obtain a pack of cigarettes.
[21:37.69]Near his bedroom window.
[21:43.55]Okay.
[21:45.43]So, uh... I'm currently trespassing, though, so I gotta get out of here.
[21:54.50]Make him smoke... Kitty pool.
[22:08.57]Can they see me?
[22:11.47]Oh, they can't.
[22:11.89]Alright, I'm gone.
[22:12.35]I'm leaving.
[22:13.31]I'm going, I'm going, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[22:19.30]This is a restricted area.
[22:21.30]And you guys have guns?
[22:25.96]I'm being shot at.
[22:26.78]I just wanted to get my son's ball.
[22:29.70]He threw it over the fence accidentally.
[22:41.42]Alright.
[22:45.62]They're shooting at you with nail guns.
[22:47.84]Alright, I need to go.
[22:50.64]Let's track the cigarette one.
[22:56.84]Might as well.
[22:57.26]We'll give it a try.
[22:59.74]So, pack of cigarettes.
[23:01.19]I gotta get over here.
[23:01.87]I should be able to pop this lock without anyone seeing me.
[23:09.83]I think, right?
[23:11.95]They didn't see it last time, so why would they see it this time?
[23:22.49]Okay.
[23:25.79]Pack of story.
[23:26.83]Pack of cigarettes.
[23:28.99]There they are.
[23:30.85]All right.
[23:33.30]Infiltrate the Janus property now.
[23:36.36]Which is right there.
[23:39.96]He's using the waypoint, so I mean...
[23:43.71]Whatever.
[23:44.05]Should I not be doing that?
[23:45.03]I mean, I just like found it.
[23:47.49]I didn't activate it at first.
[23:48.79]I'm cheating.
[23:49.29]Cheater.
[24:10.17]Is this considered cheating?
[24:12.12]Alright, I'm gonna get in through there.
[24:18.66]But this place is heavily protected.
[24:33.96]You get... you get a game refine.
[24:39.11]How do I get through there?
[24:41.57]Go get that man some gas.
[24:45.55]What?
[24:47.05]Place food?
[24:47.91]What food?
[24:48.65]What?
[24:48.91]No, I just made it smaller.
[24:50.77]I just made sushi in front of these people.
[25:05.81]Gas, gas, gas.
[25:07.13]Well, I need... I just lost my fish.
[25:08.67]I just turned it into sushi.
[25:10.11]Yeah, I know the main story.
[25:11.33]I know it.
[25:11.91]Mission story revealed.
[25:12.73]No, I don't... I know.
[25:13.23]I know.
[25:13.51]I know.
[25:37.16]I don't trust a man that can't eat a rare steak?
[25:40.18]Yeah.
[25:40.89]Call it, I want E. coli.
[25:41.69]What the fuck did you say?
[25:42.51]Don't, let it slide, let it slide, let it slide, let it slide.
[25:46.07]Let it slide.
[26:13.29]The propane tank was just over here.
[26:15.24]I already opened this.
[26:18.66]Where's the propane tank?
[26:21.81]Probably by the grill, right?
[26:24.49]Cheater.
[26:36.35]Hey, it's in the game.
[26:37.49]I'm gonna utilize the waypoints if they show themselves.
[26:40.33]Otherwise, look.
[26:41.93]I'm gonna level with you guys here.
[26:43.15]Like, level with me.
[26:44.93]You've seen the way that I've played the game so far.
[26:47.75]If there was not a blip on the map somewhere, eventually telling me where I need to be, I would just drown people in toilets.
[26:56.96]You know what I mean?
[26:58.16]I would just throw gas canisters over here.
[27:01.65]I would just fucking punch people.
[27:03.23]Like, that would happen.
[27:05.05]It just would.
[27:06.69]I would get lost somewhere and I would just start, like, karate chopping people.
[27:11.35]And I do that anyways.
[27:22.44]Understandable.
[27:23.20]Have a nice day.
[27:27.22]Propane tank.
[27:28.74]Alright, so let's save this here.
[27:31.88]Let me help you with that.
[27:48.50]Another boyfriend?
[27:49.16]Another boyfriend?
[27:50.70]What?
[27:51.08]Is he your... Is he your boyfriend?
[28:16.14]Why is that the go-to?
[28:23.72]What's gonna explode?
[28:32.31]I love that so much.
[28:35.03]Who is this guy?
[28:37.05]Is he your boyfriend?
[28:38.79]Ugh.
[28:41.09]The canned dialogue.
[28:42.49]Because I turned off the stove.
[28:43.99]Shoot him.
[28:44.41]If you could take a couple of steps back, it'd make me a little more comfortable.
[28:51.40]He's investigating distraction.
[28:53.20]Why would that be a distraction from that far away?
[29:04.75]Okay.
[29:14.08]Somebody turned on the gas over here!
[29:18.16]I know I'm gonna make like a joke that's been made a thousand fucking times before but like honest to God like that's that's like the Don't touch the thermostat family guy joke and like I'm not gonna make it but I'm just saying like he heard the he finally heard the thermostat from like that far away.
[29:36.51]I didn't make it.
[29:37.33]I didn't make the joke.
[29:40.75]I didn't say anything.
[29:41.73]Wait, he's leaving.
[29:53.76]Go get rat poison.
[29:56.41]Well, that would make sense now, wouldn't it?
[30:00.75]Pick up meaty bone.
[30:03.95]Can I eat?
[30:07.41]I can't eat the meaty bone.
[30:10.95]Oh, shit.
[30:11.52]I gotta hide this guy.
[30:14.92]Where can I put him?
[30:20.90]Okay.
[30:24.72]That wouldn't be a good idea.
[30:31.01]Can I stuff him in the cupboard?
[30:31.77]There's gotta be a closet right here.
[30:42.55]Put him on the stove.
[30:44.87]Alright, so I gotta get rat poison now.
[30:51.07]Is this cooked or is this raw?
[31:00.38]I just turned it off.
[31:02.06]What are they searching for?
[31:23.04]What?
[31:24.60]Bothered?
[31:25.24]Sure.

[31:28.68]That too.
[31:29.10]Lot of words describing my feeling right now.
[31:53.24]Does she not know how to turn it on?
[31:55.10]She doesn't know how to work the TV.
[31:56.34]Oh, there it is.
[31:58.39]Oh my.
[32:11.62]How does it keep turning off?

[43:48.46]Alright, so I have to wait.
[43:50.12]I just have to wait.
[43:54.46]I just have to serve people and wait for them to get here.
[44:04.05]Alright folks, the food is ready.
[44:06.97]This is gonna take so long.
[44:08.26]Oh, god damn it.
[44:10.76]I gotta think of something.
[44:11.38]I gotta just relax.
[44:12.70]I'll be fine.
[44:13.40]Do you have me relax?
[44:15.70]That was a Dennis the Menace joke in 2018.
[44:17.18]That's true.
[44:20.98]You really do have to serve for 20 minutes.
[44:24.63]That person thought that I was making a... A joke?
[44:27.49]No?
[44:28.43]I actually have to wait till he gets over here.
[44:29.91]Whatever he's doing.
[44:30.57]No, thank you.
[44:38.31]mail guy.
[44:39.43]See, the problem there was I was supposed to... I was supposed to take out the mailman before he came to get food.
[44:48.65]I did it in reverse.
[44:51.95]Alright, serve a guest to make room for Cassidy, but Cassidy's not here.
[44:59.00]Should I just wait till he gets here?
[45:00.14]Is he your boyfriend or something?
[45:07.91]Okay, mission story completed, but I know I didn't.
[45:17.70]He's still not here.
[45:18.58]I just have to sit here.
[45:22.02]See, this is why here comes the mailman again.
[45:36.38]The mailman is the real target.
[45:48.48]See, he comes over and talks.
[45:49.68]He's like, hey, Rich!
[45:50.46]Mail... I'm not gonna poison the mailman again.
[46:04.68]He's gonna make his way over here after whatever he's doing over there, and then I'm gonna take him out.
[46:11.82]Why does the chef have snowboard glasses on?
[46:13.60]That's a great question.
[46:18.88]Excuse me.
[46:20.18]Care for a snack?
[46:22.64]He rubbed his belly to indicate he was hungry.
[46:27.13]Cheers.
[46:28.07]My pleasure.
[46:34.28]Oh wait, I forgot.
[46:34.92]I can't have fried food.
[46:35.81]Here he comes.
[46:37.17]Alright, get out of the way then.
[46:38.51]He's like sniffing.
[46:39.55]What is this like?
[46:40.43]Oh gosh.
[46:40.83]Get out of the way then.
[46:41.53]Here he comes.
[47:05.09]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[47:14.49]Oh my god, get out of the way!
[47:22.97]Okay, it's poisoned.
[47:23.99]I don't do small talk, Mr. Mailman.
[47:25.25]Mr. Mailman.
[47:51.63]Ah, there's an open spot.
[47:54.23]There you go.
[47:54.87]It's an open spot.
[47:56.15]Psst.
[47:56.91]Care to try something special?
[47:59.17]What in the world?
[48:02.15]Like, he never had french fries before?
[48:06.28]He's very confused by french fries.
[48:13.62]Thank you very much.
[48:14.26]Oh, no.
[48:16.97]I'm not gonna be able to hold it back.
[48:22.87]What?
[48:23.75]Uh, is he... Hey, hey, just in case you wanted to know, man, you're sick.
[48:39.32]You probably should go see somebody or something at some point or something.
[48:47.89]Is this a doctor?
[48:50.55]Wait a minute.
[48:52.07]Is that his personal doctor?
[48:54.43]Okay.
[48:57.91]He's not going in there with them, is he?
[49:09.55]Why are you both going in here?
[49:15.30]What?
[49:19.62]What is...
[49:36.74]There we go, we got to see it.
[49:38.62]It was an accident.
[49:44.62]Well, that was an accident.
[49:46.24]I can't dress up as him?
[49:48.40]Oh, shit.
[49:49.02]Where do I put him?
[49:49.90]Oh, in here.
[49:55.33]Hold my hair, that's the challenge.
[49:59.41]He accidentally drowned.
[50:00.61]Alright, so now, what if... So, I'm going to come out here, and he's not going to come out.
[50:04.83]So, what does this guy have to say about that?
[50:08.72]You know what I mean?
[50:11.38]You're obviously waiting for him to come out of the bathroom.
[50:24.31]What?
[50:27.97]Why would you hear this?
[50:29.90]Wait, look at this!
[50:33.26]What?
[50:40.59]He's like, he came to investigate?
[50:42.23]Why would... I don't understand.
[50:43.41]You were standing next to the door.
[50:44.47]Why would you come all the way across here?
[50:46.47]Alright, so I got... He's dead.
[50:48.49]I'm gonna try to make my way over to the residence.
[50:52.09]I got the key now, so I can just go in.
[51:10.39]But first... Okay.
[51:12.53]No!
[51:37.76]That's the same person that I drowned before.
[51:40.04]God damn it.
[51:43.06]Right here.
[51:45.42]That's the same person that I drowned.
[51:57.50]Alright.
[51:58.06]We're good.
[51:58.56]We're done.
[52:01.01]What did that person deserve?
[52:02.59]Absolutely nothing.
[52:04.75]They didn't deserve that at all.
[52:10.27]They just happen to be standing in this spot in front of me.
[52:14.17]Alright.
[52:15.01]So.
[52:16.35]Let's take a look.
[52:18.71]Mr. Cassidy is dead.
[52:23.62]The real question is... I need to get... I'm going to go to the front.
[52:27.70]I'm going to go this way.
[52:29.68]There's a clue over here.
[52:31.50]Let's see what this is.
[52:38.14]public park not at all you remind me of a young alan smith poison water bottle I don't have any poison pick up the hammer yep charles blake iii for a better world okay well doesn't matter you should think about a career of mail delivery uh well here's the mailman again what do you even oh I get it do you deliver mail when I was your age I didn't like having my route interrupted either
[53:03.15]I'll let you focus.
[53:04.30]Just give it some thought.
[53:05.72]I'll put a good word in for you if you need it.
[53:07.58]Okay.
[53:08.20]Thanks, I guess.
[53:10.50]Is this... Excuse me, sir.
[53:12.32]Are you a registered voter?
[53:14.16]I'd love to tell you about a new candidate who might just change your life.
[53:17.24]Yes, sir.
[53:17.70]A total game changer.
[53:19.30]Okay.
[53:19.48]I'm listening.
[53:20.16]Wonderful.
[53:21.55]Well, I'm sure you're aware that voting season is upon us again.
[53:24.85]Yeah?
[53:25.87]And if you're anything like me, a recent immigrant to this fine country, the candidates this time around just aren't very...
[53:34.19]Savory.
[53:35.39]But we have a man here today who's about to change all that.
[53:39.17]I don't care much for politics.
[53:41.37]That is exactly why Blake is out ringing doorbells today.
[53:45.52]He has no stakes in Washington.
[53:49.04]No connections to the establishment.
[53:51.54]No allies hidden away in lawless groups that pull the strings.
[53:58.79]He's just a common man who decided that he wouldn't take it anymore.
[54:04.62]He's looking for him.
[54:05.28]He's here to clean up.
[54:06.60]He doesn't know where he is.
[54:08.09]Exactly what you want and to make sure the government doesn't stick his nose into everything.
[54:14.76]Fascinating.
[54:16.38]How is he going to achieve all that?
[54:18.46]By imposing restrictions and pushing crippling laws that will bind legislators to their desks for decades.
[54:26.17]He's going to keep doing that forever.
[54:28.63]I couldn't even pay attention to this.
[54:30.07]Washington-based desk jockeys, so much work they simply won't have time to enforce the existing laws.
[54:36.63]Cassidy!
[54:37.78]while they're busy looking.
[54:38.76]Cassie, can you hear me?
[54:40.36]Use his executive powers to undo the existing laws.
[54:45.42]It's a radical approach, sure, but quite effective.
[54:48.29]And this Blake character, he's out here now ringing doorbells?
[54:53.59]Sure is.
[54:54.21]Why do you ask?
[54:55.07]No reason.
[54:55.91]Good on you.
[54:56.41]Be sure to vote come election day.
[54:58.01]I've got to become Mr. Blake.
[54:59.35]Spread the word about Charles Blake III.
[55:01.57]Have a flyer.
[55:02.43]Charles Blake III appreciates your support.
[55:05.25]I definitely want to.
[55:05.99]Okay, he's out here ringing doorbells.
[55:07.23]That's what he looks like.
[55:07.99]Okay.
[55:13.02]How you doing?
[55:15.06]Is that him right there?
[55:18.22]That's him right there.
[55:24.34]There he is.
[55:25.30]Cassidy!
[55:25.72]Mm-hmm.
[55:35.38]You're gonna give a flyer to yourself?
[55:37.04]Oh, no.
[55:46.18]We lost three followers.
[55:59.90]Well.
[56:00.74]Okay.
[56:00.94]So when does he have diarrhea?
[56:02.62]He's going to go in that outhouse right there.
[56:33.70]I don't have... The only intel I have on him is... Where's the flyer?
[56:38.07]I want to see the flyer.
[56:42.43]An apple a day.
[56:45.43]Whack-a-mole.
[56:46.40]So this is not even on here.
[56:47.38]This is a secret one.
[56:48.38]Alright, so objectives.
[56:50.96]Where's my... That's not intel?
[56:53.90]The flyer?
[56:56.22]Free burgers.
[57:04.49]In the inventory?
[57:08.17]Oh, you mean like this inventory.
[57:09.83]Wait, I don't want to lose him.
[57:13.67]Where does he go?
[57:14.41]He goes door to door.
[57:15.61]Okay, is he going to sit here?
[57:21.53]No, don't throw a bone at him.
[57:24.73]Don't do anything like that.
[57:29.15]Alright, let's go.
[57:34.31]Political flyer.
[57:35.11]This flyer outlines political platform of local politician wannabe Charles Blake III.
[57:40.31]Reading through various parts, it seems Blake is intent on using a higher office as a way of transforming rules set forth by the local homeowners association.
[57:47.82]That's it.
[57:48.44]I'm the only person here.
[57:49.76]I've been here for so long, too.
[58:06.38]Yeah.
[58:06.68]Yeah, I just... I'm not sure who I want to vote for.
[58:10.07]You seem like a nice guy.
[58:12.17]What's your stance on more than five dogs in a house?
[58:17.09]Would you be okay with that?
[58:42.36]I know you're only allowed by the state to have three.
[58:47.56]But I like having a lot of dogs.
[58:51.00]Will you move somewhere?
[58:51.98]Mr. Blake, did I miss everything about Mr. Blake?
[59:01.13]I'm not going to just shoot him.
[59:02.29]No, I need to... He needs to go somewhere.
[59:04.63]Goddammit.
[59:19.74]Is he even linked to an opportunity?
[59:21.07]No, I just wanted to see if I could become that guy.
[59:23.55]And that would mean door-to-door.
[59:24.49]I could go knock on the door, right?
[59:25.69]I got an achievement for that.
[59:40.72]Okay.
[59:42.18]I know there's a...
[59:47.55]I know there's a real estate thing going on.
[59:48.79]This guy's looking around still for the... Sir!
[59:51.41]Mr. Cassidy!
[59:53.07]You okay?
[59:55.03]Oh, this is not good.
[59:56.97]Nolan Cassidy!
[60:00.93]Hey!
[60:02.07]Where are you, Mr. Cassidy?
[60:03.43]Alright, I didn't... I kinda need this gig, so... What?
[60:07.15]...unharmed would be much appreciated.
[60:08.77]He's in a random open house basement?
[60:11.69]Mr. Cassidy!
[60:13.71]I love hide-and-seek just as much as the next guy, but come on.
[60:17.78]Where the hell did he go?
[60:29.15]Frame rate, stop.
[60:31.27]Hey, where are you, Mr. Cassidy?
[60:34.91]I kinda need this gig, so if you could just show yourself unharmed, it'd be much appreciated.
[60:42.50]That's gonna hurt me.
[60:45.99]Oh shit!
[61:03.48]Here's the best part about this.
[61:05.86]He's gonna wake up and guess what he's gonna do.
[61:09.47]Mr. Cassidy!
[61:11.07]I just woke up somewhere.
[61:12.49]I don't know where I am right now, I'm not sure, but where are you?
[61:15.43]Mr. Cassidy!
[61:16.09]There's a big lump on my head.
[61:23.51]Actually, this is a better disguise.
[61:24.93]The guy's bodyguard?
[61:26.59]Mr. Cassidy, I woke up naked somewhere!
[61:28.69]I mean, I'm not sure what this is, but... I woke up next to a plumber!
[61:36.92]I thought it was you, maybe?
[61:38.22]It was a person?
[61:44.13]Are you Cassidy?
[61:44.99]Oh shit.
[61:49.59]Uh, is everybody put- whatever.
[61:50.79]In the basement?
[61:51.75]No.
[61:53.29]You're fine.
[61:54.03]Close it.
[61:55.59]Alright.
[61:56.09]I can now go- I'm just gonna walk right into the Cassidy residence.
[62:01.53]Mr. Cassidy.
[62:02.41]Am I Cassidy?
[62:04.29]Have I been Cassidy the whole time?
[62:07.38]If you can tell me, that'd be nice, man.
[62:08.62]Alright.
[62:12.46]Let's just... What do I got?
[62:14.63]Let's go meat bone this guy in the head as hard as we can.
[62:17.23]Treehouse!
[62:18.77]Treehouse!
[62:52.05]Thanks, please stand back.
[62:53.83]I'll check it out Take care Anyone copy looks like we got trouble on our hands.
[63:08.40]Don't know what yet We need to secure the area.
[63:11.36]Hey, I need you to get it on our way.
[63:12.86]It's possible.
[63:13.46]I need you for your own thing Do you understand stay alive?
[63:17.47]That lady saw me, I think.
[63:19.45]I'm just trying to get him to come up to the treehouse.
[63:26.31]What's that, Command?
[63:27.31]What's that, Command?
[63:28.25]Okay.
[63:28.81]Yogi Bear is on the loose.
[63:30.61]And he may have stole a picnic basket.
[63:33.60]I'll be on lookout, too.
[63:34.78]Command, please acknowledge.
[63:36.54]Come in, Command.
[63:37.84]You have got to be kidding.
[63:39.74]This is happening again.
[63:41.76]Again?
[63:42.24]Oh, yeah.
[63:44.94]I was going to shoot up there, too.
[63:58.05]Come on up.
[64:07.15]Come on up!
[64:10.55]Come on up!
[64:16.73]Come on up here!
[64:18.14]Will you get up here?
[64:28.23]I'm out.
[64:28.89]I'm out.
[64:32.27]I'm out of bullets.
[64:33.52]I don't even know where this guy is.
[64:37.36]Oh, they're being obscured by the trees.
[64:40.86]Mr. Cassidy!
[64:42.62]Mr. Cassidy!
[64:49.81]Is that you?
[64:51.59]Should I be shooting at you?
[65:15.20]I can't, like, vault over that.
[65:17.02]That's unfortunate.
[65:18.16]Alright, let's go.
[65:24.93]Ow!
[65:31.91]I'm a bodyguard here, so this should be fine.
[65:36.73]How would I be trespassing here?
[65:37.95]I'm like a secret agent!
[65:39.89]Secret agents... I just have to flash my driver's license to this guy.
[65:53.41]oh have you seen that janice's oddball nurse has added again oh yeah the bird guy I think he comes early just to chat with the birds bird guy spends more time with them than he does with janice a couple weeks ago I walked past him and I have to tell you bird guy some pretty personal wait like like flavor bird shared his opinion on janice let's just say so janice has an appointment with a male nurse every saturday he's down feeding the birds by the creek at the moment
[66:22.94]I don't even need that, though, man.
[66:23.97]Look at me.
[66:24.53]What was that for?
[66:25.67]Why do they have a statue of, like, Michael Myers?
[66:27.19]With, like, an axe.
[66:53.59]Imagine if it was.
[66:54.55]Imagine if your town just had like a statue of Michael Myers, like a big bronze statue.
[66:59.99]No, I need that.
[67:31.30]So I'm allowed to go in the house.
[67:33.74]I'm just one of the bodyguards, right?
[67:35.26]That would make sense.
[67:37.18]Yeah, see?
[67:39.22]What about a frisk?
[67:40.32]I'm the one that frisks you.
[67:41.78]You understand?
[67:44.22]Who the fuck are you?
[67:46.34]Who the fuck is this guy with a name tag?
[67:49.50]Are you serious?
[67:51.58]Don't bring it with you.
[67:59.99]You can't just confiscate my property.
[68:02.46]I need it to get rid of an aggressively invasive mole in this poor old man's backyard.
[68:07.74]Calm down, demolition man.
[68:09.77]Unless it's a flesh-eating mutant mole, you don't need explosives.
[68:13.58]We're going to keep them safe in our trunk until you produce that license, okay?
[68:17.14]Come on, man.
[68:18.27]One of Janus' gardeners has decided to clear a series of mole tunnels using explosives.
[68:24.41]Explosives.
[68:25.63]I applaud his enthusiasm, but sadly, local police have confiscated his equipment.
[68:31.64]You stuff the holes, and then you blow up the tunnel system so it collapses.
[68:36.72]Look it up on YouTube.
[68:38.02]Sir, if the American...
[68:39.65]I don't want to do that, though.
[69:08.53]I think I'd rather just go in.
[69:10.19]Somehow.
[69:11.85]I mean, explosives are fun, but... I feel like I would just do that anyways, wouldn't I?
[69:19.08]Back to the safety of the house.
[69:20.56]Well, not for long.
[69:25.86]Hey, why is this guy acting like a dog?
[69:30.43]Shoot him!
[69:34.33]Alright, let's do this one.
[69:35.47]We'll do the mole.
[69:43.67]Seems like an interesting way to get in the house.
[69:52.41]Alright, I have a license for it.
[69:56.37]This is it.
[69:58.49]Story revealing.
[69:59.45]Let's save.
[70:02.05]Save it.
[70:02.91]Back to the safety of the treehouse.
[70:04.27]No, not for long.
[70:04.91]Calm down, demolition man.
[70:11.91]Yeah.
[70:12.05]Police.
[70:12.19]Trunk.
[70:12.37]YouTube.
[70:40.08]Alright.
[70:41.24]So I gotta follow the gardener around.
[70:42.94]What?
[70:51.23]So what's his routine?
[70:52.77]We gotta find out what his routine is.
[71:05.69]He goes to the truck.
[71:07.13]I don't see... I mean like... Clowns to the left of me.
[71:12.53]Clowns to the right.
[71:13.37]Here I am.
[71:14.17]I'm at the circus with you.
[71:24.36]I've been holding on to that one for a long time.
[71:33.09]I think I've already said that.
[71:34.21]Have I said that one yet?
[71:36.89]I think I've already said it.
[71:38.03]I've been singing that in the shower for the last fucking three weeks.
[71:44.47]I've done that already.
[71:45.41]I have.
[71:46.29]So I forgot that I've already said it.
[71:47.55]Where can I put them?
[71:56.92]In the mailbox.
[71:57.62]Can I put them in the trash?
[72:17.59]Come on, that's funny though.
[72:18.95]Like, that's a funny line.
[72:23.11]I can't put him in the trash.
[72:38.02]Alright, what else do I need?
[72:40.38]I'm not the bodyguard anymore.
[72:41.62]I've got his stuff.
[72:45.23]That's a stand-up comic from 2002.
[72:46.57]That doesn't mean that it wasn't funny.
[72:51.34]It wasn't meant to be funny.
[72:52.44]It was meant to... That's what I've been singing in the shower while the steam fills my eyes.
[72:56.81]And it fucks with my cognitive ability.
[72:58.39]So obviously I thought it would be funnier.
[73:01.27]Sir, this is a restricted area.
[73:13.52]Can I pick up?
[73:14.31]Oh, well.
[73:14.65]Okay, this is lagging the game.
[73:18.89]Can I get in here?
[73:19.49]This person had been home for a while.
[73:31.34]Say what?
[73:36.80]This whole area is out of bounds.
[73:39.96]Whoa, psycho, I saw that.
[73:42.18]What are you, crazy?
[73:45.75]Don't come in here.
[74:18.26]Thought I was going to be able to get away with it.
[74:24.42]What?
[74:27.80]Why did this auto save?
[74:31.55]Lining up the shot.
[74:32.17]Yeah, I was leading my target.
[74:33.43]He was eventually going to come over there, guys.
[74:48.38]You're not allowed in here?
[74:49.18]Okay, sure.
[74:50.96]Fucking clown to my left, clown to my right.
[74:52.80]You know, where the fuck could I possibly be?
[75:10.22]This is not suspicious at all.
[75:12.80]I'm just checking on the fence.
[75:14.56]Aye.
[75:14.74]Okay.
[75:36.52]He doesn't... Everything's good, okay.
[75:42.81]He can hear this.
[75:43.59]He can hear, like, the animal in the bush.
[75:47.85]Oh, God.
[75:48.55]Does he even turn around?
[75:49.81]Yeah.
[75:57.42]Don't come over here.
[75:58.54]Just... I'm not gonna sit.
[76:01.30]Hey, you alright?
[76:23.54]You must have seen the son of a bitch.
[76:25.37]Sorry, I didn't see nothing.
[76:26.61]I have no idea.
[76:29.65]I got hit with meat out of a bush.
[76:32.47]I have no idea.
[76:33.49]And I'm gonna go home.
[76:34.60]I'm gonna go get my mom out.
[76:37.24]I poop my pants.
[77:01.99]Well, all right, so I make like a reference to an old song and change the lyrics incredibly brilliantly and I That was not funny.
[77:10.36]I say the word poo out loud I'm gonna go poo my pants
[77:24.22]Oh wait, he's coming back!
[77:25.58]No, I had an opportunity to do this!
[77:28.78]Oh come on!
[77:30.46]Sir, what happened?
[77:41.01]I don't know!
[77:41.53]I just keep falling down!
[77:55.27]Come on, get up.
[77:56.09]Don't waste my time.
[78:00.19]Do we have any idea of the suspect?
[78:02.43]What?
[78:03.15]Don't go anywhere.
[78:03.79]I'm gonna take you down.
[78:08.78]Do you have any idea?
[78:17.20]Oh, I gotta stop this.
[78:19.00]What is... Did this just happen?
[78:21.08]Oh, I got an extra chance.
[78:26.06]It saved it right when he came over.
[78:27.36]Right?
[78:57.67]These guys are just waiting.
[78:58.79]They're like, you know what, let's just watch that guy.
[79:02.87]See what happens to him.
[80:03.48]Oh fuck, they heard that.
[80:12.62]Why would you put it there?
[80:19.74]He just like said it.
[80:42.84]Yeah, I think you're fine.
[80:44.47]Just try and get up.
[80:48.57]Do we have a description of the suspect?
[80:50.83]It's all a blurry mess.
[80:53.00]It could be...
[81:26.02]I wish I had more items.
[81:27.81]That's the sad part.
[81:28.67]I wish I had every kitchen item.
[81:30.93]I would keep doing it to this guy.
[81:32.71]Forever.
[81:47.75]I'm gonna say that you guys might think that this is not real, but it is real.
[81:53.17]If I was not streaming right now and I was just playing this game silently in my bedroom, I would do that probably for two hours.
[82:00.48]I probably would.
[82:02.74]I would probably keep doing this.
[82:04.82]For like an hour and a half.
[82:05.80]It would just be fun.
[82:12.48]Do it now.
[82:12.98]I can't do it now.
[82:14.00]Like, you understand?
[82:14.70]Like, I... There are 3,000 people here watching.
[82:19.49]If I sat there for two hours throwing the wrench at the fucking worker...
[82:25.39]How many people do you think would be gone in 10 minutes?
[82:27.95]I'm gonna say half.
[82:34.00]Alright, infiltrate the garden.
[82:37.52]You would gain- I would definitely not gain viewers.
[82:42.42]If I- oh my god, if I did, I don't even- that would be the- Oops-a-daisy, oops-a-daisy, oops-a-daisy!
[82:52.13]I have to take this guy out.
[82:53.59]I have to.
[82:54.40]Right?
[82:54.64]I have to.
[83:05.04]Shit, the fucking security camera.
[83:09.57]I don't know what happened here.
[83:11.55]Shit.
[83:33.47]Where was it?
[83:38.97]1651?
[83:39.41]Yeah.
[83:39.73]Whoa, hold on a second.
[83:44.30]That's not the right one?
[83:48.38]Yeah, that's correct.
[84:01.21]Alright, I got my stuff.
[84:02.15]Wait, I need the hammer.
[84:10.22]Okay, let me get over there.
[84:11.84]I need to save the game.
[84:15.99]Well, there it is.
[84:19.11]So you can just walk around.
[84:20.43]Until you find everything.
[84:23.91]That's cool.
[84:25.93]Alright, get to the garden.
[84:32.27]I'm not going to go that way.
[84:33.25]Although, why would I have to... I'm the gardener.
[84:38.26]That guy can see through my disguise.
[84:39.76]I'm sorry.
[84:41.22]I don't...
[85:02.95]I've been recorded by a security guy throwing it into his face.
[85:07.43]All right, what do we need to do?
[85:09.81]I'm here.
[85:10.17]Oh.
[85:35.05]See if I can fix it with a bone.
[85:39.10]As you can see, we have a mole issue.
[85:41.04]Yeah, I do see that.
[85:42.02]I know a permanent solution might take some time, but you could just fill the holes by the end of the day.
[85:46.44]Yeah, I'll do it.
[85:51.17]Come find me when you're done.
[85:51.95]Okay.
[85:55.81]Huh.
[85:56.67]I guess there's one way to go about it.
[85:58.23]Yeah.
[85:58.53]Well, he's a professional.
[86:02.92]Yes.
[86:03.12]Situation is under control.
[86:09.11]Guns are the best, too.
[86:10.07]To block holes with.
[86:20.69]Are there any others?
[86:21.25]There's some over here.
[86:22.05]Hold on.
[86:25.36]Oh.
[86:25.90]Yeah.
[86:28.52]So, the other day I accidentally asked Janus about that urn in the basement.
[86:33.43]Big mistake.
[86:35.43]Haven't you learned anything yet?
[86:37.19]How long did he talk for?
[86:38.99]Can't really be sure.
[86:40.49]Zoned out eventually.
[86:42.31]Not as bad as that time I used the gramophone inside the house, though.
[86:46.00]Man, that tune kicked off some old memories and some long-ass stories.
[86:50.82]He dragged me down to the basement and showed me all of his memorabilia.
[86:54.90]You know how it works.
[86:56.06]Interesting.
[86:56.82]Maybe you should try to spark some of those old stories, 47.
[86:59.89]What?
[87:00.29]Who knows what secrets Janus might reveal.
[87:03.19]Well, let me do this the right way.
[87:09.18]I need- I don't have the fucking explosive device.
[87:17.38]No, I'm talking about like rea- I blew that dude up at the door that yelled at me.
[87:21.82]Something bad has to happen to this guy though.
[87:26.42]Uh...
[87:28.32]Why are all these doors locked?
[87:30.14]No, I have the key!
[87:30.96]Why do I- I'm like popping the door, I have the key in my pocket.
[87:41.22]Dammit.
[87:48.16]Dammit.
[87:48.76]I was trying to see if it could- I was trying to see if it could go up into the camera lens.
[88:00.79]Say hi to your mother for me.
[88:02.87]Yeah.
[88:07.15]All right, let's go.
[88:08.27]Block the holes.
[88:17.60]Into the camera lens, yeah, like I was trying to throw it in there.
[88:29.89]So I'm going to have to put an explosive in one of these.
[88:32.41]He's going to come out in his garden.
[88:35.60]He's going to lean down.
[88:37.18]I remember picking these radishes.
[88:38.90]Obtain an item to block the molehole.
[89:01.39]Conceal an explosive.
[89:03.04]In a molehole.
[89:03.82]Well, I mean... I... Block five more holes.
[89:19.14]I gotta block... I actually have to block all the holes?
[89:25.72]Shit.
[89:32.71]I don't want to get rid of the meat though.
[89:34.75]Is there any random shit around here?
[89:35.95]Baseball.
[89:39.24]I'm just running around the yard picking up random trash.
[90:05.78]I need to find more objects.
[90:09.85]What?
[90:10.31]What?
[90:10.57]I'm just going to put the guns in them.
[90:16.97]Right?
[90:21.51]Alright, I need one more locked.
[90:32.16]The less guns I have, the better.
[90:33.20]That's right.
[90:35.49]Alright, I just need... There it is.
[90:36.51]Shovel.
[90:36.79]Alright, where's that last hole?
[90:40.65]There's one... There's a gun in there.
[90:43.20]That one's blocked.
[90:45.10]This one's blocked.
[90:45.92]This one's blocked.
[90:50.00]One more over here, right?
[90:51.04]Yeah, there we go.
[90:55.84]I can't... I want that meat.
[91:06.40]Hold on.
[91:07.42]There's a muffin here.
[91:08.04]Okay.
[91:26.06]Alright, done.
[91:26.82]And I still get to keep my meat.
[91:28.61]That's good.
[91:31.29]I'm done.
[91:32.05]Great.
[91:32.73]Let me have a quick... Look.
[91:37.79]Hold on, he doesn't look in it, right?
[91:39.19]That one has a gun in it.
[91:40.05]Don't open it.
[91:43.81]Inspect this one?
[91:45.03]Is he gonna inspect that one?
[91:46.45]Oh, fuck, he's gonna pick up the guns.
[91:48.57]Alright.
[92:03.12]Oh no.
[92:03.34]Holy shit.
[92:03.60]AnonymousGifter.
[92:03.92]Thank you, AnonymousGifter, for your 10 community subs.
[92:05.74]Thanks so much, dude.
[92:06.22]AnonymousGifter.
[92:07.58]For your 10...
[92:34.23]Random subs.
[92:37.75]Um... Is he gonna actually inspect them?
[92:42.84]Because if so, then I'm in trouble.
[92:46.20]I'm afraid I'm gonna save here, just in case something bad happens.
[92:49.64]I'm gonna save, like, over here.
[93:05.14]James.
[93:06.92]Cold War spymaster and the first Providence constant.
[93:11.80]I wonder how much he remembers.
[93:14.28]How little he cares.
[93:15.96]Gardner took a bit of an unorthodox approach, but they do look filled to me.
[93:20.72]Well, I think I'll be the judge of that myself.
[93:23.69]Thank you very much.
[93:27.29]Moles, moles, moles.
[93:30.21]Reminds me of a funny story.
[93:33.44]What?
[93:34.16]He's telling old stories?
[94:05.40]I just keep hearing the... Where's the one?
[94:23.19]Beautiful work.
[94:24.89]The pests will soon be gone, and then I can get back to planting.
[94:30.42]At last, the actions of the first constant catch up with me.
[94:35.70]Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.
[94:41.50]Still.
[94:41.80]We are close now, gentlemen.
[94:43.99]Both targets are dead.
[94:49.05]Calling in!
[94:49.79]Calling in!
[94:50.71]We got multiple homicides on our hands.
[94:54.57]Someone's not happy.
[94:58.61]Command!
[94:59.25]Anybody there?
[95:00.17]Come in!
[95:01.00]We got some violent jackass knocking people down.
[95:07.65]Is he dea- I killed him?
[95:08.65]I didn't kill that guy.
[95:09.65]Wait, he's talking- I thought he was- I thought he was gonna shoot the other guy.
[95:45.95]That guy just backed up.
[95:50.86]Bye!
[95:51.12]Think I'm gonna let that guy get away with it?
[96:21.89]Why?
[96:22.33]You don't remember that guy?
[96:25.81]You guys just forget what that guy did?
[96:28.25]Oh, I need the microfilm.
[96:42.69]What's that, Commander?
[96:43.45]Okay, continue searching.
[96:48.37]Should've got this first.
[96:49.67]I should've got the microfilm first.
[96:53.04]Is what I should've done.
[97:14.26]Microfilm.
[97:15.10]Not in his bedroom?
[97:18.50]There it is.
[97:18.76]Hidden microfilm.
[97:19.40]And then we gotta go... We have to go into that other lady's house.
[97:29.99]I need to be... I need to be somebody else here.
[97:31.51]I gotta save... not save it right...
[97:49.99]You already did I already killed them both
[98:49.51]We're good!
[99:03.12]Alright.
[99:04.00]Review the microfilm.
[99:06.18]Which... I think I just have to go next door.
[99:15.74]Because it was the lady.
[99:16.80]It wasn't the lady that was having a party.
[99:18.99]Was it this house or was it the house next door?
[99:21.23]Where's the barbecue?
[99:21.95]I mean, it's one of these.
[99:26.86]You shaved your head in a few seconds?
[99:28.48]Yeah, I got tired of it, you know?
[99:45.76]Vital info revealing.
[99:48.36]Yeah, I gotta put the microfilm into the projector.
[99:51.96]Wait, is this another... I think it was the other house.
[99:57.21]A robe, no.
[100:00.93]It was the other house.
[100:04.25]I remember the lady at that party was like, Yeah, I've got this old projector upstairs.
[100:10.78]I just don't know what to do with the darn thing.
[100:12.40]Alright, let's go.
[100:35.29]Other side.
[100:43.08]Bye!
[100:45.52]There's the party.
[100:57.88]He's lost.
[100:58.68]No, I gotta go up there.
[101:04.28]Because it was in this house upstairs, right?
[101:08.18]From what I remember from the conversation, that is the lady right there.
[101:11.06]Alright, where's your projector?
[101:21.35]That's a pretty... Who is this guy?

[103:14.72]Review the microfilm.
[103:15.50]So it has to be... Is it upstairs?
[103:17.60]Or is it downstairs?
[103:20.60]I'm, like, right over it.
[103:21.62]It's, like, right here.
[103:25.02]Hey!

[105:51.43]Attic button.
[105:52.33]Nope.
[105:53.04]That's not an attic pulley thing.
[105:57.18]How do I get up to the attic?
[105:58.18]I have to go, like, on the roof or something?
[106:06.11]Because I don't see any more stairs.
[106:07.89]Over here?
[106:12.31]Attic button!

[106:50.81]How do I get out of here?
[106:52.15]They're both dead.
[107:23.99]Locate his robe?
[107:26.71]Wha- Why do I need to locate his robe?
[107:40.12]I need to look at it more?
[107:53.70]I think I got all the dialogue out of there.
[107:55.32]Um...
[108:28.10]Killing so many cars right now.
[108:30.33]Why would you?
[109:01.10]Go!
[109:32.39]I just want to throw a baseball at somebody out the window.
[109:34.13]That's all I want to do.
[109:34.89]There's this man doing stuff that is clearly illegal.
[109:39.49]I'll look into it.
[109:45.90]Would you mind going to see what it is?
[109:47.14]Command, please acknowledge.
[109:50.02]Come in.
[109:50.68]Command.
[109:51.56]All right.
[109:51.96]There's a hard-ass criminal out there.
[109:54.26]They made an apprehensive sound.
[109:57.10]All right, okay.
[110:00.39]Hello, security.

[110:35.35]Oh, God!
[110:36.01]I have to... I got it.
[110:42.97]It went through.
[110:51.55]Uh, so... How come I can't leave?
[110:56.13]If it's something I'm still... Do I actually need to go to this guy's house and put on his robe?
[111:06.16]I need to find the robe.
[111:08.90]So this is not just as simple as kill the two guys.
[111:11.38]Oh, alright.
[111:15.64]Locate the robe.
[111:16.54]I was supposed to find... These houses are, like, empty.
[111:29.62]Huh?
[111:30.50]Huh?
[111:32.36]What do you think you're doing, throwing this stuff around?
[111:35.29]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[111:38.21]No, I got it on the roof.
[111:39.31]Mom, I'm not going to be able to get it back.
[111:45.07]Well, you threw it up there.
[111:46.33]It's staying up there.
[111:47.09]I'm sorry, sir.
[111:50.54]I can't let... Sir, you should go back the way you came.
[111:54.08]You might get into trouble.
[111:55.74]That's it.
[111:57.04]One foot in front of the other.
[111:58.42]Goodbye forever.
[112:05.13]God, I really have to go and, like, do all this right now.
[112:10.44]I thought I was done.
[112:13.10]You can't be here!
[112:16.90]Put your hands up!
[112:19.30]No sudden... God damn it, man.
[112:23.91]Hey, psycho!
[112:24.87]No, you don't!
[112:30.97]Who the fuck is shooting at me?
[112:32.27]That guy was shooting through the wall.
[112:49.36]Alright, where's the microfilm?
[112:53.76]Not the microfilm!
[112:55.18]Where's the... Where's the robe?
[112:59.58]I'm stuck in like a time loop.
[113:04.14]Locate the robe.
[113:05.96]That's over here.
[113:10.82]Why did... Hold on a second.
[113:14.77]Why did they tell me to do that?
[113:16.13]When they're like down here.
[113:33.82]Am I still on this mission?
[113:34.74]Yeah, because apparently I already did them.
[113:37.60]They're already dead.
[113:38.31]Now I'm trespassing over here now.
[113:48.43]God damn it.
[114:08.02]I'm found trespassing right now.
[114:09.84]Where do I need to go?
[114:13.13]I need to go to the other place next door.
[114:15.09]To the west.
[114:15.95]Objective clue B. Or objective clue reveal.
[114:20.23]I'm just going to load the save.
[114:37.55]It's going to go from, let's go from here.
[114:44.82]Is he still trying to throw a brick?
[114:46.28]Wait a minute.
[114:47.42]Let me read the intel to see why I can't leave.
[114:56.93]So I need to, I need to do this.
[115:03.46]okay so I did that's the meeting point right didn't I already do this like didn't I already reveal the meeting point and that's just where I need to go so constant meeting confirmed that's what I needed right
[115:28.89]Confirm an existing connection between the constant and reveal a date they would meet.
[115:32.93]So it's in his robe somewhere.
[115:37.11]Alright.
[115:38.81]Y'all come on, this is the first mission that they've done where I've had to actually complete the clue parts.
[115:43.29]It was just do the mission, kill the guy, and leave.
[115:49.57]So I'm going to go over here.
[115:55.89]I'm going to go back to the Cassidy property.
[115:59.71]Hopefully nobody freaks out about this.
[116:07.29]Can I, like, jump down from here?
[116:10.37]Come on, I can't just jump down from here.
[116:16.57]Alright, well, whatever.
[116:18.33]Walk out the front door.
[116:26.25]Look at all these painting materials.
[116:32.33]Perfect normal, but throwing baseballs is illegal.
[116:36.65]Alright.
[116:37.97]So, it's just this house right here.
[116:39.81]I'm not allowed to be in here, but I'm gonna find the meeting point.
[116:45.46]Don't load it.
[116:46.24]Save it.
[116:50.78]That's a clue reveal I'm going to.
[116:54.60]Don't I have to do it all?
[116:56.28]Or do I just have to go get the rope?
[117:01.09]That's like, is that the only thing I have to do?
[117:08.09]Just get the rope.
[117:09.49]You have to do them both.
[117:10.59]Alright.
[117:13.63]Hold on.
[117:13.85]I'm right here.
[117:14.25]I'm going to do it.
[117:22.84]Currently trespassing again.
[117:24.30]Let me save it right here.
[117:31.95]Just find it.
[117:34.55]I should have brought... I thought of... whatever.
[117:40.03]Fuck off.
[117:51.41]Okay.
[118:06.90]He's upstairs.
[118:07.88]Apparently, wherever it is, it's up there.
[118:09.79]Okay, let's go stare at him.
[118:22.56]Hello, hi.
[118:27.06]Yo, bodyguard!
[118:35.44]Alright, found the meeting point.
[118:39.44]Tactical bathrobe.
[118:40.42]No!
[118:42.02]I don't know where he went!
[118:52.30]He was here somewhere!
[118:53.79]Tactical!
[119:04.30]So I don't have the clue now.
[119:07.94]Now I have to go... Alright, so... Was that guy supposed to have a conversation?
[119:16.84]Because now I have to go over here.
[119:37.98]Okay, let's go get the robe.
[119:38.90]I can't save it yet.
[119:40.28]So the robe is now... Okay, straight ahead.
[119:43.61]It wasn't the robe.
[119:44.29]Hi.
[120:08.62]Well, I would have done this first.
[120:11.44]I didn't know I had to do all this.
[120:14.38]I guess here, when it says eliminate, eliminate... Oh, also you have to do this too.
[120:19.60]I just pressed the button.
[120:21.70]Just figured we could just go.
[120:24.87]I would have done this all in reverse.
[120:28.93]So, I need to... I don't want to pop that in front of everybody, but I think I have to.
[120:43.36]Hey, what if I happen to... I get to do what I want in Hitman?
[120:51.09]What happened to that?
[120:52.31]I have to go find these clues?
[120:54.11]No, just stuff them in the guy's pocket.
[121:04.64]He should have a map to... Oh, the guy should have a map up his ass.
[121:07.74]Gotcha.
[121:08.60]I hear you.
[121:12.05]All I have is a fucking shotgun.
[121:17.08]Hello, young man.
[121:27.11]This is Helen West of Helen's Muffin Kitchen.
[121:48.71]All right, the robe is upstairs
[122:22.21]Why do I keep having the door?
[122:28.19]Okay, give me the bathrobe.
[122:32.99]A ceremonial robe of some sort with a note from Janus attached.
[122:36.79]Hmm.
[122:39.04]The note is interesting.
[122:40.76]Janus has asked Helen to do a few repairs on the robe before he leaves for his annual trip.
[122:45.86]He even put a date there.
[122:47.84]This is valuable information, 47.
[122:53.75]I just had to pick up the robe.
[122:55.09]That's all I had to do.
[123:17.66]The shotgun?
[123:18.98]I'll be fine.
[123:27.23]Gandalf cosplay.
[123:32.90]What's really facing?
[123:38.32]Who saw me here?
[123:39.06]What do you have to do with this?
[123:42.50]What do you have to do with this?
[123:43.58]You're just a jog.
[123:44.84]You're a jog.
[123:57.22]You're in a jog.
[123:57.94]Why would you be like one of the sentries that can see through my disguise?
[124:01.30]Oh, it's the fucking shotgun.
[124:02.18]I'll be fine, guys.
[124:33.46]Alright, let's go.
[124:54.42]Shotgun Wizard sounds like it's something I want to play in Dungeons & Dragons.
[124:58.98]what he's reading but it looks like it's the most interesting thing he's ever come across the new cassandra snow novel meaning slivers of past shimmers or something like that see my wife's reading it now I can't get her to do anything around the house no no it's not a novel
[125:14.15]Get out of my face.
[125:15.03]Alright.
[125:49.05]Who the fuck is this?
[125:51.98]Is this guy reading Janice's diary?
[125:57.64]Is that his diary?
[126:00.93]He's got all kinds of math problems in there.
[126:20.42]Alright, give me that diary.
[126:21.33]He's in a weird spot.
[126:33.43]Okay.
[126:33.71]Guys leave?
[126:47.59]Good work, 47.
[126:49.33]We now know Janus is meeting with the Constant at an event related to the Ark Society.
[126:54.21]And we have an approximate date as well.
[126:56.47]I think that's all we're going to get.
[126:59.11]We're close to the finish line.
[127:01.57]It's time to end this.
[127:04.12]All mission objectives are completed.
[127:05.76]47, once you've left Whittleton Creek, I will notify Providence of our discovery.
[127:13.02]In the meantime, we'll go over the clues you found.
[127:16.23]Let's go!
[127:16.63]See you later, sucker.
[127:51.91]Pass.
[127:52.21]The present.
[127:52.69]Breaking news.
[128:00.58]Wear the robe.
[128:01.62]I feel like that's what chat has been saying for the last, like, 30 straight minutes.
[128:09.14]Zero stars.
[128:09.90]Here it comes.
[128:19.64]Well, you can't get stars if you, like, throw fire extinguishers at people at some point through the mission.
[128:26.21]Like, I just, I can't, that's how I like to play.
[128:32.05]One hour?
[128:32.43]The last mission took an hour.
[128:34.07]The mission before that took an hour.
[128:46.91]To get five stars, I would have to just sneak around.
[128:49.49]Do everything by the book.
[128:53.53]You wouldn't get to see a baseball get thrown.
[128:55.57]Because I wouldn't be able to do that.
[128:56.71]Oh, I got an auto MK2.
[129:10.67]I got like halfway into trying this one.
[129:26.52]The Ark Society.
[129:28.88]One of Providence's more obscure outfits.
[129:33.38]I've heard whispers.
[129:35.28]A survivalist club for the global elite.
[129:37.73]Billionaires preparing for a global collapse.
[129:40.53]And now we know the Constant will attend their next gathering.
[129:44.23]So where is it?
[129:45.25]That's the catch.
[129:46.73]The report is redacted.
[129:48.05]No names, no location.
[129:50.87]So it's a dead end.
[129:51.95]I can't track them, not without ICA backup.
[129:56.53]Now, I'm no big shot analyst, but... How many missions?
[130:00.75]There are two missions left.
[130:02.09]Janus was the Ark Society's founder, so chances are they'll want to pay their respects in private.
[130:09.26]Track the coffin.
[130:11.00]Worth a shot.
[130:18.00]You all right?
[130:20.02]It comes back in flashes.
[130:22.81]Fear, anger, but like it happened to someone else.
[130:29.42]Your gift and your curse, what they did to you.
[130:33.40]Well, I spent a long time feeling guilty about that.
[130:36.80]Now, I wonder who got the better deal.
[130:39.70]So we've got a split personality here.
[130:41.10]He's like inside of my head.
[130:43.15]Wow.
[130:44.99]It's the same person.
[130:47.05]The ass end of nowhere.
[130:49.01]But this is where Janus's remains were shipped to.
[130:52.83]Our choice for a final resting place, wouldn't you say?
[130:56.41]Not bad.
[130:58.37]So we stake it out, await the next gathering, then we waltz in and kidnap one of the world's most powerful men without ICA backup.
[131:09.41]Like I said, it's a long shot.
[131:11.49]I don't have a problem with this.
[131:16.07]We'll take it.
[131:19.75]That's fine.
[131:20.09]I mean, they're short anyways.
[131:21.10]It's not like they're big, elaborate cutscenes.
[131:23.10]They just are there in between.
[131:29.27]The Ark Society.
[131:46.14]How did you not see this coming?
[131:48.53]My God, we came this close.
[131:50.73]The old man could have buried us all, our families.
[131:53.91]Do you think you feel more betrayed than I do?
[131:57.49]Get some perspective, please.
[132:00.35]Janus is dead.
[132:02.03]Lucas Grey is about to join him.
[132:04.97]And a cornered animal is twice as dangerous.
[132:08.25]Let's be perfectly clear.
[132:10.63]We were not exposed.
[132:12.96]The threat is neutralized.
[132:15.44]We are back on track.
[132:18.14]Even so, from this point on, we expect you to take... No.
[132:22.24]There is no way I'm doing that.
[132:24.78]How can you question my loyalty?
[132:27.47]In case treachery is contagious.
[132:30.63]Do you really want to do this to me?
[132:36.52]Is there a problem, Secretary?
[132:42.95]No problem whatsoever, madam.
[132:49.82]What?
[132:51.76]What, was this a VR game?
[132:53.04]Apparently that's all that was.
[133:06.55]Here's to loyalty.
[133:21.74]My man on the island confirms that the constant has arrived.
[133:26.18]We head out at sundown.
[133:28.34]Classic syringe gun.
[133:29.34]In case the crew get ideas.
[133:32.63]Why are you doing this, Mr. Grey?
[133:34.81]You had a chance to walk away.
[133:36.61]Why didn't you?
[133:40.75]A year ago, I'm working security for this banker, Cobb, only to find out he's a Providence operative.
[133:50.10]I've been running for decades, only to wind up where I started.
[133:55.16]We've all got barcodes on the back of our heads.
[133:58.38]Most people just never notice.
[134:03.96]47 told me about your parents.
[134:06.69]How did they die?
[134:10.25]Car bomb.
[134:11.35]Surrey, 1989.
[134:13.37]Company named Blue Seed didn't care to pay for their mistakes.
[134:18.10]But I like to think no one's untouchable.
[134:23.28]I'm...
[134:25.34]I'm sorry for your loss.
[134:27.22]You feel it, don't you?
[134:30.28]Unlike him, you feel it all.
[134:32.72]Everything you've done.
[134:37.16]It's a dangerous thing.
[134:41.09]Having a conscience.
[134:43.97]I was gonna make a Star Wars joke, but I'm gonna let you guys do it.
[134:48.43]If I make the Star Wars joke, everyone's gonna fucking scream at me.
[134:55.17]You know, if I leaned in the mic right there and I was like, you failed too.
[134:57.47]I would have seen minus twos every, uh, the whole time.
[135:06.50]Alright, so.
[135:08.89]Uh, here's the Arc Society.
[135:11.30]Attention, gentlemen.
[135:12.80]Our source on the island just made a critical discovery.
[135:15.74]The constant has a poison chip embedded in his neck.
[135:19.59]A failsafe, in case he's compromised.
[135:21.85]Okay, so he can't die.
[135:22.77]We should have expected something like this.
[135:25.09]So, we subdue the constant before he has time to react.
[135:29.09]Not that simple.
[135:30.00]the device is remote just feed them red bull stay on the island two kill switches have been entrusted to twin sisters zoe and sophia washington two young ambitious providence operatives and newly appointed chairwomen of the ark society apparently even the constant is unaware of this arrangement
[135:48.26]Right.
[135:48.72]Change of plans.
[135:49.72]We divide and conquer.
[135:52.39]47 takes out the Washingtons while I figure out a way to get the Constant off the island.
[135:56.69]It'll be tight, but once we're back at the ship, we should be able to surgically remove the chip before the partners have time to react.
[136:02.93]47... Oh, I'm sorry.
[136:03.71]I wasn't paying attention.
[136:04.75]I had my headphones on.
[136:06.99]Zoe and Sophia's father is president of a powerful conservative think tank, one of Providence's prime assets.
[136:15.22]So, kill them both.
[136:50.74]Alright.
[136:52.06]Hold on a minute.
[136:53.53]Let me make sure.
[136:54.13]Okay.
[136:55.53]Zoe Washington.
[136:56.69]Any disguise, any method.
[136:59.07]Any disguise, any method.
[137:00.69]Do not eliminate the constant.
[137:04.70]Do not kill this person.
[137:06.76]That's it.
[137:08.70]There's no clues or find clues.
[137:11.18]Just don't kill him.
[137:12.76]Kill them.
[137:14.54]Okay.
[137:16.34]I'm ready.
[137:22.54]Planning.
[137:26.10]Silver ballers.
[137:27.62]Yep.
[137:28.08]I'll wear my... That's not a really good costume.
[137:32.59]Why wouldn't I put on a wig?
[137:34.47]Me putting a wig on is more effective than me covering my eyes and nose.
[137:49.88]What's he got?
[137:51.06]Uh... Proximity.
[137:55.90]Briefcase.
[137:56.72]Aluminum travel briefcase.
[137:58.16]I keep the lockpick and the fish.
[138:03.96]Wear the robe.
[138:08.02]I don't have the robe.
[138:11.24]I don't have the robe.
[138:13.42]Alright, you ready?
[138:15.74]Let's go.
[138:30.61]47 was the channel for Nickelodeon at my grandma's house when I was a kid.
[138:38.60]What?
[138:39.86]The Isle of Skane.
[138:41.72]Headquarters of the Ark Society.
[138:46.21]Same, same.
[138:47.11]Was it?
[138:47.75]Founded by Janus in 1991, the Ark Society is the world's most exclusive club.
[138:53.84]Its plutocratic members fear the downfall of civilization, and they are willing to pay huge sums to ensure their own survival.
[139:03.35]Once a year, they gather here to shop the latest survival products and to showcase new initiatives and breakthroughs.
[139:12.32]Right.
[139:13.40]These gatherings are shrouded in mystery, so we have limited intel on what to expect on the other side of the walls.
[139:19.81]The Washington Twins are hosting their first annual gathering as chairwomen of the Arc Society, and the Constant is known to attend every year.
[139:27.58]Okay.
[139:28.94]This is an interesting castle.
[139:29.70]Beyond that, you're on your own.
[139:31.62]Good luck, gentlemen.
[139:33.18]I dare say you're going to need it.
[139:34.72]This is just the first part of Bioshock Infinite.
[139:43.89]Don't kill the Constant.
[139:55.44]Alright.
[139:58.79]Hold on, one second.
[140:00.43]I need to look at this.
[140:03.97]Uh, what is this?
[140:08.88]Oh, nope, never mind, I'm good.
[140:10.70]Alright.
[140:11.60]So, eliminate the Zoe Washington, Sophia Washington, they're both over there.
[140:17.44]Don't kill that guy who's trapped in what seems to be a bubble.
[140:22.13]Ah, one more, I see.
[140:23.75]Won't you join us, sir?
[140:24.93]We were just about to begin.
[140:26.45]Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the annual gathering of the Ark Society.
[140:32.40]As Ark patrons, you are welcome to explore the castle grounds.
[140:36.40]However, certain areas are off limits, including the keep, which houses the members area, convention space, and council meeting.
[140:45.02]Should you wish to apply for Ark membership, please be aware that such cannot be bought
[140:51.30]Are we going to get a tour?
[140:54.60]Alright.
[140:56.19]But, what's that though?
[140:58.51]No, let's do the tour.
[140:59.49]That's what I want to do.
[141:06.35]He just said epic.
[141:06.99]He did it.
[141:10.84]This place is epic.
[141:17.96]Some people are saying you need to take his robe.
[141:21.50]All in due time, guys.
[141:23.17]It's all in due time.
[141:27.34]My God, I don't know why every time I load another area, I just... Yes, Zoe Washington, one of our newly appointed chairwomen, has prepared a brand new official ceremony scheduled to take place in the upper quarter.
[141:41.42]You're starting to freak me out.
[141:43.40]I didn't do anything.
[141:45.94]He's getting closer to me.
[141:48.96]I believe that is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[141:51.32]Please enjoy your evening.
[141:53.58]The bar is right up ahead.
[142:12.08]Good to see you too.
[142:17.27]By the way, do you need to pee or anything?
[142:23.70]Just curious.
[142:39.48]It's hard to do 47's voice.
[142:41.16]There's nobody.
[142:41.74]Ah, there are people over here.
[142:47.83]Hello, hello.
[142:49.09]Hey, look, a guy had a piano!
[143:12.29]No, so by the way, I just reduced my score by two stars, I think.
[143:22.07]Okay, so it's a party.
[143:23.04]Should I get a drink?
[143:25.14]I got, uh, sushi.
[143:25.66]Mmm, wine.
[143:40.71]and popcorn this drink isn't even there he is
[144:04.96]I just took a sip of somebody else's wine and put it back down.
[144:09.40]Where's he going?
[144:13.17]Is he going up to the... This is definitely off-limits, right?
[144:16.81]I mean, there's a Bloodborne cage over there.
[144:19.26]Where's he going?
[144:24.69]He's going to make an announcement or something?
[144:26.39]Let's explore.
[144:26.97]No, he is going to make an announcement.
[144:44.11]I think I'm just gonna be with the party.
[144:46.90]Okay, everyone's gonna go to the upper courtyard.
[144:48.66]Does nobody else care about this?
[144:50.20]Why are only like three people going?
[145:19.77]Off-limits?
[145:20.13]Is this off-limits?
[145:21.73]Off-limits.
[145:22.67]Are we off-limits?
[145:25.87]No, I gotta keep up with the group.
[145:29.63]Who is it?
[145:39.79]That thing's gonna slide.
[145:49.33]I'm sure you understand.
[145:54.09]Initiation door.
[145:55.03]A locked door leads to the castle basement.
[145:56.71]With an initiation interview, Bozoi Washington will take place.
[146:00.39]But to gain admittance, initiates need to collect a number of tokens.
[146:10.55]So, to get through to Munchkinland, I need tokens.
[146:18.74]This is cool Then the Olympics can now begin
[146:50.88]I'm gonna get the gold medal!
[146:52.82]Come on, I gotta win the gold medal!
[146:55.06]For swinging it, people!
[146:56.06]Is that the, um... I mean, there is a difference between... Is this money?
[147:19.88]You put, you throw like a thousand dollars in there?
[147:22.34]So what's this actual ceremony?
[147:26.11]It's the Star Citizen Kickstarter.
[147:28.27]Oh god.
[147:51.77]Alright, it's my turn.
[147:55.53]I don't have any money.
[147:57.47]Was this like Ebenezer Scrooge?
[148:09.17]Waking up, he's about to see the Ghost of Christmas Present.
[148:11.59]Wait, what's this?
[148:12.09]The annual Phoenix ceremony.
[148:24.48]symbolizes the collapse of civilization for which the Ark society emerges unscathed and triumphant.
[148:31.29]Ah, rebirth.
[148:32.83]I get it.
[148:33.45]What's new is that the master of ceremonies will light the effigy on fire with Zoe Washington inside it.
[148:39.17]Huh.
[148:40.15]A big show, you say?
[148:42.07]Hey, whatever sells.
[148:48.47]Okay.
[148:50.11]Well, the Phoenix effigy.
[148:55.12]Burning effigy sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
[149:04.43]Let's save it here.
[149:11.11]Uh, somebody mentioned I do have coins.
[149:13.31]No, I have a fish.
[149:16.85]Well, I don't have very much money.
[149:20.77]But where I come from...
[149:23.76]This is worth gold.
[149:28.93]Thank you.
[149:29.75]Thank you.
[149:30.79]I want it back!
[149:43.49]I want it back!
[149:44.27]Alright, let's go escape.
[149:49.25]Locate the escape door hydraulics.
[149:53.48]That's definitely not allowed back here.
[149:54.94]Token!
[149:56.64]How many do I need?
[149:57.28]Can I give this guy a token?
[150:16.01]I want to be like the rich asshole that's all the way in the back.
[150:19.01]That doesn't give a shit.
[150:20.77]Everyone's throwing cash up there.
[150:22.03]They want all the claps.
[150:22.89]And I'm just back.
[150:23.47]I'm the guy at the auction.
[150:24.91]Right?
[150:25.11]That just raises up like 50 million dollars.
[150:28.72]He doesn't fucking want any fanfare.
[150:30.42]Ah, fuck this.
[150:31.16]Who cares?
[150:32.32]That's 20 million.
[150:34.26]Maybe you should pick that up.
[150:41.78]I need that coin.
[150:42.64]Your fish is done.
[151:12.61]The secret elevator!
[151:14.20]Go!
[151:14.54]Flush him out!
[151:18.00]What?
[151:18.24]I can't... How do I get out of this?
[151:19.68]How do I go down?
[151:20.80]Watch out!
[151:21.16]He's gotta be close by!
[151:22.46]Nothing.
[151:22.70]I'm here, Command.
[151:27.79]Moving on.
[151:29.31]Security breach!
[151:30.39]I need you to move now!
[151:32.39]Oh, God.
[151:33.11]Um... Okay, okay.
[151:39.70]Wait!
[151:40.34]There he is!
[151:44.28]Hey close that Jesse Pinkman
[152:12.64]Alright, I still have that coin, right?
[152:14.94]No.
[152:15.26]Oh, I still have the fish!
[152:16.54]Alright, we went back to when I had the fish still.
[152:23.72]Alright, we're good.
[152:25.14]So I gotta get back there.
[152:26.20]Alright, locate the escape door.
[152:29.90]Here's the token.
[152:30.82]Token detailed with the relief of the Ark Society insignia.
[152:34.14]Looks significant.
[152:34.76]Yes, I need it for the door.
[152:41.96]This dude over here... Is anyone going to stop me from doing this?
[152:48.10]Okay, this guy... I'm going to electrocute this guy.
[152:50.78]That's very, very, very certain.
[152:52.52]Like, look.
[153:00.34]I need a screwdriver to do this.
[153:05.46]Hmm.
[153:07.03]Alright, well, is there anywhere I can go from here?
[153:11.69]Yes, I'm currently trespassing, but I can climb through this window.
[153:14.45]Let me get some tools.
[153:20.35]There's a wrench.
[153:20.95]Alright, we're getting to, like, the weird creepy section now.
[153:27.24]Turn on this case.
[153:31.60]Oh!
[153:35.62]It's over here.
[153:40.38]I'm in the crypt?
[153:43.25]Actually, this is good.
[153:44.47]This guy comes over here and I'll fish him.
[153:53.01]Ooh, coins.
[153:59.71]Go up the stairs.
[154:00.73]I need an outfit, though, before I do anything else.
[154:03.49]Don't kill him.
[154:04.13]Something else here.
[154:10.32]Is it just the one guy?
[154:11.22]It is.
[154:14.68]Okay, as long as I don't make too much noise, I should be able to get them both.
[154:23.37]You know what happened?
[154:33.60]This is like eavesdropping.
[154:35.02]Every time this guy moves.
[155:12.91]That was an interesting pose.
[155:25.33]I can't dump him?
[155:27.48]Okay, we're good.
[155:34.32]Man, this place is killing my computer.
[155:44.94]Can I put him in, like, a sarcophagus?
[155:46.86]He can go in here.
[155:56.09]Turn on VSync.
[156:00.35]Ah, VSync just makes my computer have input lag.
[156:02.65]What's with the music?
[156:11.58]Alright, so now I can try and go back to where I was in that other area.
[156:16.27]Alright, I might have to because this is going to be impossible.
[156:18.57]I don't think it's going to help, but I'll give it a try.
[156:33.61]Usually I get bad input lag when I have VSync turned on.
[156:45.78]Alright, so here we go.
[156:47.40]Locate the escape door hydraulics.
[156:52.14]Uh, safety protocol.
[156:55.07]Sabotage the hydraulics.
[156:56.09]I need a wrench.
[156:58.43]Which I have, but... Is this gonna make a lot of noise?
[157:02.93]The cage beneath the giant effigy in the courtyard features a hidden escape door, but according to the safety report the hydraulic locking mechanism is disturbingly sensitive.
[157:11.30]Even a slight drop in pressure could jam the lock and effectively trap the occupant inside the cage.
[157:17.04]No.
[157:17.32]Right here.
[157:24.62]Okay.
[157:24.92]Sabotaged.
[157:26.42]Locate the Master of Ceremonies.
[157:29.70]He's up.
[157:31.24]Oh, I can go up here.
[157:48.00]Definitely, I can go up this ladder.
[157:50.64]Nice.
[157:51.28]Sick.
[157:52.32]Sick.
[157:52.72]Nice, kid.
[157:53.86]Sick, kid.
[157:54.52]Nice, kid.
[157:55.53]Oh, dear.
[158:17.02]I'm talking to you, sir!
[158:23.02]Mister, you will get hurt!
[158:24.90]Trust me on that one!
[158:26.74]You will not knock anyone else out, Jeremy, mister.
[158:34.83]Don't do that!
[158:35.43]Roger!
[158:50.77]So I can't really go that way.
[159:06.16]Everyone falls for the ladder?
[159:07.68]Literally everyone?
[159:08.78]Really?
[159:09.16]I mean, it just seems so easy, doesn't it?
[159:17.79]It just looks like it's so convenient that it's too good to be true.
[159:26.81]I feel like I still could do it, though.
[159:28.21]I just have to wait until this guy's not turning around.
[159:32.33]Yeah, that's the problem.
[159:33.17]Okay.
[159:39.33]Okay, so now I've got to go from here back here.
[159:42.96]Okay.
[159:49.06]I mean, I could drop that, but that's too risky.
[159:52.42]Who's in here?
[159:53.56]Two guys.
[159:54.02]I don't have any keys.
[160:02.05]There he is.
[160:02.57]Found him.
[160:02.85]Okay, well, he's the only one that can see through.
[160:18.78]What we got?
[160:19.26]Okay, we got... Master of Ceremonies schedule.
[160:27.03]Okay.
[160:29.19]A moment-to-moment schedule for the FFG ceremony.
[160:31.04]The Master of Ceremonies appears on stage.
[160:32.48]He descends to the money pit.
[160:34.72]He makes a short statement and lights the money on fire.
[160:38.35]The master summons Zoe Washington on stage.
[160:40.51]Zoe makes a speech whereupon she enters the cage beneath the effigy.
[160:44.25]The master takes the stage and lights the effigy on fire as Zoe slips out the back door before the structure is engulfed in flames.
[160:52.66]It's just entertainment.
[160:54.06]Entertainment?
[160:57.46]I don't think I have poison.
[160:58.56]What else do I got here?
[160:59.38]Coin.
[160:59.78]Where's it going to go?
[161:00.68]I got guard here.
[161:01.38]I got music box.
[161:02.16]And...
[161:38.11]Nobody cares about this?
[161:42.47]You're the only one that's gonna look at this distraction?
[161:47.48]No, that ain't, that's not how this is gonna go down.
[161:55.44]Let's go!
[162:22.77]And he got the coin, too.
[162:25.39]You dick.
[162:28.27]How did that not hit anybody?
[162:30.09]Got just about enough of this.
[162:48.87]Did he open the door?
[162:49.71]Boomerang.
[162:57.49]I got the boomerang, but it didn't matter.
[162:59.75]Hey, hey, hey!
[163:08.87]Get up!
[163:13.10]Fuck me.
[163:13.56]Did I really not save it?
[163:50.24]What happened?
[163:51.56]I dropped the chandelier.
[163:54.70]And it didn't hit anybody.
[163:55.64]It went right between them both.
[163:57.82]In a perfect spot.
[164:00.66]And then I lost my mind and started throwing shit at people.
[164:03.22]And then somebody was found and I unloaded a clip.
[164:08.00]Alright, here we go.
[164:37.04]Oh, let's try this again.
[164:37.70]Save it here.
[164:38.36]One, two, three.
[164:38.76]Alright.
[164:39.03]Go examine somebody.
[165:06.02]So this is not gonna kill him.
[165:07.35]I have to wait till he turns it off and then leaves.
[165:12.41]What the hell is that?
[165:34.42]Hands up right now!
[165:36.44]I am back.
[165:38.24]Why would you go around throwing shit like that?
[165:43.44]Close it.
[165:43.90]Close it!
[165:47.55]Same exact scenario.
[165:50.29]Just did it.
[165:51.31]The same scenario.
[165:54.07]Why?
[165:55.77]Give me his stuff.
[165:59.19]It was just a different... I can't even...
[166:08.52]I can't believe it.
[166:13.41]I can't hide you here.
[166:18.33]The only difference is he went the other direction.
[166:23.59]Oh my god, why does my computer hate this level so much?
[166:43.11]Don't let me forget that coin.
[166:49.93]Oh, that's full.
[166:56.68]Drop the gun.
[166:58.72]Go to the ceremony.
[166:59.36]Go to the master of ceremonies with the fucking machine gun.
[167:05.04]Give me the coin.
[167:08.88]Was there one on the ground here too, or just that one?
[167:14.55]Okay.
[167:15.27]Gun.
[167:16.23]Drop it.
[167:17.93]Gun.
[167:18.67]Drop it.
[167:20.88]All I have is the coins.
[167:23.32]It's officially legal.
[167:24.12]They're not going to care.
[167:26.52]They're going to think I'm a weird person.
[167:27.95]That's it.
[167:39.45]A memo from Zoe to ARC member Axel, also called the Master of Ceremonies.
[167:43.52]Zoe has planned on an extravagant ceremony to symbolize the downfall of civilization.
[167:47.90]Giant phoenix, yeah.
[167:48.84]I already know this.
[167:56.16]Alright, I can stuff this one in my pants.
[167:57.54]So what do we got?
[167:59.91]I got fish.
[168:01.57]Two coins.
[168:02.77]Make sure the fish is what's currently equipped.
[168:04.65]Save it.
[168:05.19]It's time to do it.
[168:05.87]Let's do it.
[168:11.27]Alright.
[168:11.99]Now the ceremony's down here.
[168:14.80]They all can see through this disguise.
[168:22.96]Here goes Doctor Strange.
[168:26.30]Okay, Dad.
[168:27.62]You accidentally ordered the children-sized costume on Amazon.
[168:31.71]You didn't want to send it back.
[168:32.87]I get it.
[168:37.91]Master of Ceremonies!
[168:42.55]Do I have anything to say?
[169:15.43]No speech or anything?
[169:16.97]Okay.
[169:20.47]I did this earlier and everybody was mad at me.
[169:26.37]As much as I have a fucking dumb shitty costume on, it's cool.
[169:39.24]I don't have time for this?
[169:46.74]This is what Jerma does to his bits and cheers.
[169:49.54]Alright, there she is.
[169:54.08]There she's going around.
[170:00.76]We're gonna save it here.
[170:01.92]Because I can't be trusted.
[170:05.76]I already know this.
[170:14.05]Cook fish.
[170:20.60]That guy isn't gonna investigate.
[170:28.83]What was that sound?
[170:30.51]Zoe is ready for the ceremony!
[170:36.29]Alright, Zoe.
[170:39.14]Summon Zoe Washington.
[170:47.95]Zoe Washington, the Ark Society recognizes you as our founder's rightful successor, our inspiration, our guiding light, the custodian of our future.
[171:05.36]Excellent work, 47.
[171:07.04]Enjoy the spotlight.
[171:09.76]Patrons of the Ark Society, you are part of a select chosen few.
[171:15.70]Our founder, Janus, showed us how to survive.
[171:19.10]But survival is not enough.
[171:20.96]We must live, and we must soar.
[171:23.90]The Ark Society must not only commit itself to survival, but to progress.
[171:28.28]Be it our next home in the stars, or the next step in human evolution.
[171:32.25]This is the eternal purpose of the elite.
[171:37.11]Not just to lead, but to lead from the front.
[171:40.54]She sounds so happy.
[171:41.58]All right.
[171:42.02]Get in.
[172:33.91]Hello, sir.
[172:36.15]Look at you, Fenneker... ...all dressed to kill.
[172:39.09]Now, let's do this thing.
[172:43.89]Light her up.
[172:54.49]As the world burns... ...weed... ...rides from its ashes.
[173:00.39]Not just to survive... ...but to live.
[173:26.49]I tried to save her!
[173:28.30]Oh, fuck.
[173:29.58]Whoops.
[173:30.14]This is why I can't be trusted.
[173:56.58]Zoe Washington.
[173:58.58]The Ark Society recognizes you as our founder's rightful successor.
[174:05.22]Our inspiration.
[174:07.70]Our guiding light.
[174:09.96]The custodian of our future.
[174:13.98]Excellent work, 47.
[174:15.66]Enjoy the spotlight.
[174:18.44]Patrons of the Ark that bind you.
[174:19.76]Penelope Oliver Clark, Chosen Fury.
[174:24.24]I got the fish don't worry.
[174:25.05]I'm just her son.
[174:49.34]Time comes, and all comes tumbling down.
[174:52.20]Now don't mind me.
[174:53.08]Don't mind little John.
[174:55.46]Little Johnny.
[174:56.20]We will keep the fire alight.
[174:58.42]He has an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[175:00.64]Do not feel guilty for your privilege.
[175:06.22]Be proud.
[175:07.40]Be fearless.
[175:09.04]For the future is ours to shape.
[175:13.12]Look at you, Finnegar.
[175:14.60]Okay, I'm ready.
[175:16.06]Now, let's do this thing.
[175:21.08]Just like you.
[175:22.04]I'm gonna burn this guy.
[175:24.60]As the world burns, we rise from its ashes.
[175:30.50]Not just to survive, but to live.
[175:33.64]Alright, put it out, put it out!
[175:37.28]No, no, no, no!
[175:39.51]Put it out!
[175:57.40]What do you think it was?
[175:59.26]You think it's worth investigating?
[176:31.93]Hey, wait a minute.
[176:40.43]Please get out of my face.
[176:52.42]Oh, come on.
[176:53.12]Can you just go see what it was?
[176:54.68]For sure.
[176:57.55]No, they're not that stupid.
[176:59.29]They're not that stupid, guys.
[177:00.51]Alright, eliminate Sophia Washington.
[177:02.39]Let's go up there, see if we can find some intel.
[177:17.51]I almost shat myself.
[177:20.11]Okay.
[177:20.33]It's time.
[177:20.83]Let's head back down.
[177:21.89]I guess I could go up here.
[177:50.83]Because I believe I'm allowed to go up here.
[177:52.98]I mean, like, I'm the master of ceremonies at VIP.
[177:57.36]Yeah?
[177:57.72]Okay.
[178:02.18]I got three of these.
[178:05.32]So, what can I do up here?
[178:06.42]Thank you.
[178:11.64]Okay.
[178:18.80]What is this?
[178:19.42]The MOC, the Master of Comedy.
[178:20.68]That's right.
[178:21.28]All right, so I don't want to kill this guy.
[178:41.86]The constant.
[178:43.18]Providence's top controller.
[178:45.47]Everything depends on capturing him alive.
[178:47.97]But this?
[178:49.27]We're really doing this, aren't we?
[178:51.11]That we are.
[178:52.27]Donations, purchases, excavations.
[178:55.51]Here comes a poo-poo joke.
[178:57.41]No, I'm not doing that.
[178:58.67]A Sazerac?
[179:01.68]Certainly.
[179:02.62]And what is your name again, sir?
[179:04.78]A bird.
[179:06.50]Why?
[179:07.30]A bird?
[179:10.82]Good to know.
[179:12.88]Why is this guy talking like Mr. Rogers?
[179:15.28]What about me?
[179:15.58]Do you like my fish?
[179:17.78]Do you want to know my name?
[179:27.85]No, I'm not going to poo on the stream, guys.
[179:29.57]I'm not going to shit on the stream.
[179:30.90]Oh.
[179:39.42]That's an interesting way to hold that gun.
[179:42.28]You think the gun is going to shit in your hand?
[179:44.70]Good to see you.
[179:48.69]Okay, we've got to get in here.
[179:59.04]Gallery.
[180:00.40]They say it belonged to Montezulius.
[180:03.38]It was lost for over 500 years.
[180:34.41]Through the glass.
[181:09.98]Yeah, let's do it.
[181:10.56]Mhm.
[181:10.68]What's with them doing weird death trap magic jokes?
[181:33.99]I thought those two were lovers.
[181:36.29]On and off.
[181:37.43]Currently way off, which explains the added security.
[181:40.29]I don't follow.
[181:41.57]Think about it.
[181:42.69]Why the need for an alarm system?
[181:44.89]We're all filthy rich.
[181:47.41]Except... Ah, I see.
[181:50.69]Blake thinks Sophia might try and steal back the necklace before it's sealed in the Ark of the Legacy.
[181:55.07]So, according to its charter, the Ark Society collects priceless art and historical artifacts in case of a global disaster.
[182:03.57]And this year, world-famous treasure hunter Blake Nathaniel has donated an Aztec necklace called the Cloud Serpent to the Ark Society's growing collection.
[182:13.37]However, Blake fears that Sophia Washington, his former lover and rival, who has hunted the Cloud Serpent for years, will attempt to steal it for herself before it goes into storage.
[182:25.09]Hmm.
[182:26.05]Could be just the bait we need.
[182:28.71]What's this one?
[182:29.19]I don't know.
[182:30.63]I didn't discover it.
[182:36.22]Interesting.
[182:38.38]Okay.
[182:40.34]So I need to steal the necklace.
[182:46.19]How on earth am I going to steal this necklace?
[182:50.81]Hmm.
[182:51.53]Alarm sensors.
[182:52.93]You'll need to disable the system to get at the necklace, 47.
[182:55.35]But I could just pull the fire alarm, right?
[183:02.08]Why don't I just pull the fire alarm?
[183:06.61]It's the fuse box.
[183:08.01]Well, let's follow the... Can I steal?
[183:10.07]Are these allowed?
[183:24.57]Hey, you in the ceremonial mask.
[183:30.99]You have to eat all the eggs.
[183:59.61]Okay, well, this is... It goes up there.
[184:03.03]Do I need to climb this?
[184:06.43]They're gonna obviously... I need to turn the lights off, because they're gonna see me do this.
[184:10.25]Oh.
[184:27.54]I didn't... I'm trying to turn off the lights.
[184:32.85]I guess it worked.
[184:38.99]Well... Hey!
[184:40.25]This area is off limits.
[184:42.66]I'm getting help.
[184:44.68]I don't like... Hey!
[184:46.04]Better get your head out of your ass double quick.
[184:48.40]Hey, you!
[184:49.24]This is a restricted area.
[184:52.18]Hey, wait a minute.
[184:54.32]I'm taking you out of here.
[184:55.93]Follow me.
[185:00.19]I already told you to follow me.
[185:01.93]What's the problem, bozo?
[185:06.35]Hmm.
[185:07.41]Hey, you.
[185:07.83]That's gonna hurt me.
[185:10.61]Someone is... Man.
[185:16.94]I got him.
[185:17.40]I got him.
[185:22.32]Well, all right.
[185:22.78]So there's a shitload of people up there.
[185:24.12]Okay.
[185:27.14]Okay.
[185:32.75]Alright, and they can all see... I gotta get a different disguise, then.
[185:36.71]Actually, I might... I might be able to get it.
[185:45.49]Anyway, the Washington twins found it first.
[185:47.59]The way I hear it, Sophia literally has the necklace in her hand.
[185:52.31]When Nathaniel repels from the ceiling, it triggers this ancient death trap and, you know, murder and mayhem.
[185:58.60]But...
[186:00.70]There's no door up there though.
[186:03.90]I think I might be able to take him out.
[186:05.32]It's very possible.
[186:07.68]Right now, right now, right now.
[186:08.82]I need help right now!
[186:30.45]I have to go a different way then.
[186:40.57]It could have been possible.
[186:42.72]If I had choked him out and ran around.
[186:44.08]Yeah, I know.
[186:45.14]Let's go... I'm going to go this way.
[186:46.20]Steal the necklace.
[186:46.70]Don't show me the fire axe.
[186:47.38]I'm not picking it up.
[187:00.09]Here's the fire.
[187:01.27]Fuck it, man.
[187:05.02]Help me, damn it.
[187:06.12]Evacuate the package.
[187:08.24]Evacuate the package.
[187:10.30]Copy that.
[187:12.51]I need you to be calm and do exactly what I tell you, okay?
[187:16.29]I'm not an idiot.
[187:45.46]Hello there, sir.
[187:46.70]Ooh, I got you.
[187:48.14]I got you, motherfucker.
[187:49.32]Come here.
[187:49.66]Come on, how do you read me, over?
[187:51.68]Some loose, canny, disturbing...
[188:15.56]Cool, thank you.
[188:22.19]All is cool, all is cool.
[188:26.81]Uh-huh.
[188:30.37]Cool.
[188:31.05]What?
[188:31.21]Hey, what the hell's happening?
[188:35.87]Why are you looking in the... Why are you looking in here?
[188:39.16]Do you have info on the perp?
[188:41.00]He looked like one of the ceremonial masters.
[188:43.68]Command!
[188:45.03]Are you going to investigate that or what?
[188:56.92]Mistake.
[188:57.68]Oh, god damn it.
[189:03.08]I got... I just have a fish.
[189:04.90]I have one fish.
[189:05.54]Hey.
[189:13.47]I don't give a fuck.
[189:18.49]Hold on, wait, that's not silenced?
[189:29.31]That's not silenced.
[189:30.89]Well, the guy I need to disguise as is currently about to...
[189:38.58]No, why'd you shoot him?
[189:39.98]Why'd you shoot him?
[189:40.68]I was trying to shoot him.
[190:09.34]Oh!
[190:09.60]It's me!
[190:13.49]This is an elite guard.
[190:16.15]Alright.
[190:17.49]Elite guard.
[190:18.63]I have to dump them all.
[190:19.55]Watch out.
[190:41.51]Alright, nice.
[190:42.43]I'm ready.
[190:46.87]Let's give it a save right here.
[191:01.03]What the hell?
[191:02.99]Evening, sir.
[191:16.81]I thought that was just supposed to be him.
[191:22.43]It's not him.
[191:22.95]Okay, I need to disguise as this person down here.
[191:30.02]They're going up the stairs.
[191:31.16]So I'm going to cut you off this way.
[191:32.76]I need that mask.
[191:39.28]I just... It's not gonna happen.
[191:41.43]It's just not gonna happen.
[191:42.55]In fact, I'm not gonna be able to open this door either.
[191:44.59]Unless do I have the key for the door.
[191:46.85]I don't.
[191:47.15]I have to sneak through this guy.
[191:51.35]And then upstairs.
[191:55.47]That guy can see, but it doesn't matter.
[191:57.55]This opens, and then I should be able to get... There they go.
[192:04.50]Upstairs.
[192:06.98]Anything in here I can do?
[192:13.89]No, I don't need to do that.
[192:16.51]I'm going to get a pause moment here because I think my dog needs to go outside.
[192:20.61]Let me get there.
[192:22.95]Do you even know who I am?
[192:27.60]Sir, just take my word on this.
[192:47.95]When does he end up?
[192:54.88]I'm gonna do it too.
[192:57.70]No, what the fuck are you doing?
[193:08.60]I can't move.
[193:09.17]I can't go down.
[193:12.21]I can't drop down here?
[193:13.67]Oh, I can't do anything.
[193:38.46]You think that I could move to that ledge and climb?
[193:40.29]What are they dragging him to?
[193:41.09]Oh, my God.
[193:48.45]Yeah, but somebody can see me out here.
[193:49.83]I can't be out here for more than, like, two seconds.
[193:55.02]See?
[193:55.30]Like... Oh, my God.
[193:59.18]Just slide down.
[194:00.86]Slide.
[194:01.72]Why is it so complicated?
[194:06.54]Where the fuck did he... Where did he take it off?
[194:11.70]I don't even know where the fuck that guy even went.
[194:15.44]Where is he now?
[194:22.32]Is he just gone?
[194:25.12]Is the guy... Did the guy get taken out?
[194:26.53]Alright, I gotta... Hold on.
[194:28.47]I gotta take the dog out.
[194:29.15]I'll be right back.
[194:54.51]Alright, he was sprinting around in a circle here.
[194:58.47]He just didn't want to be in the room.
[195:00.59]Alright.
[195:02.01]So, the question is, did they drag them away?
[195:05.21]I'm not sure I can do this right now.
[195:11.04]I think I have to restart it.
[195:23.00]Where did I save it from here?
[195:25.48]Right here.
[195:27.92]Uh, I'm in the same disguise, so this should be fine.
[195:36.54]This time I'm gonna push him out and I'm just gonna go right after him.
[195:51.17]Ugh!
[195:57.76]Actually, I might be able to just take him here.
[196:00.72]Oh, what's this now?
[196:02.69]Link, you backstabbed me.
[196:09.09]Link, stand back.
[196:12.55]I'll check it out.
[196:15.53]Okay, got it.
[196:16.29]You okay?
[196:16.89]Come on, we need some help here to clean this mess up.
[196:27.08]I don't know what it is about this level, man, but it's driving me crazy.
[196:35.43]My CPU's not even doing anything.
[196:37.13]I'm at like 24% CPU usage.
[196:37.87]Why is it doing this?
[196:59.43]This is not good, my friend.
[197:12.28]Not good.
[197:21.63]I'm sorry.
[197:22.13]I take the dog.
[197:25.05]Can I not do this?
[197:26.15]Is this over now?
[197:27.25]Is this over anyways?
[197:32.32]Oh, I can do it.
[197:41.74]Sorry you didn't get to see that.
[198:02.74]But, my god!
[198:03.92]Does anybody know of a solution here?
[198:08.42]Because my... My game just does not want to run in here.
[198:17.29]We've turned down the graphics and everything, but my CPU is running fine.
[198:20.41]I have a 1080.
[198:22.63]Why is this happening?
[198:26.51]Don't know why.
[198:27.55]I have a shotgun on my back.
[198:40.14]Is it the drivers?
[198:41.44]That actually might be... What was this?
[198:44.84]I need his stuff.
[198:47.30]Well, you missed it.
[198:47.96]It was really funny.
[198:48.70]Well, it wasn't that funny.
[198:50.31]I dropped it right on his head.
[198:53.71]And nobody noticed.
[198:59.63]Angry text from Sophia.
[199:01.51]To me.
[199:06.42]Where is she, though?
[199:09.14]Up there.
[199:13.46]Thank you.
[199:13.92]Cap it at 15 frames a second.
[199:23.85]That's so weird.
[199:40.89]I don't know what it is, but if you're like a billionaire or like a trillionaire.
[199:44.23]Sophia.
[199:46.15]Well, isn't this ironic?
[199:47.81]Is it all billionaires that want weird shit?
[199:50.06]That is Sophia Washington, chairwoman of the Ark Society, professional treasure hunter, and Providence operative.
[199:58.08]Quite the resume.
[200:00.84]Like, why would you have this?
[200:02.34]What is this for?
[200:03.12]You have all these screens that just have one image?
[200:12.98]Even if that idiot Block decides to veto me, I have an ace up my sleeve.
[200:17.60]Thy will be done.
[200:18.94]I look forward to your machinations then.
[200:23.25]Slade, aren't you dead yet?
[200:30.67]Hi.
[200:31.87]Sophia.
[200:32.55]Blake?
[200:33.90]I almost didn't recognize you without a knife in my back.
[200:36.58]Well, foreshadowing.
[200:37.94]I see that now.
[200:39.42]Can we talk?
[200:40.46]This should be good.
[200:41.76]Follow me.
[200:43.12]Good evening, sir.
[200:55.56]Excellent, 47.
[200:56.98]Let's give Sophia her heart's desire, shall we?
[200:59.52]You've got one minute.
[201:01.02]One minute.
[201:02.14]I did wrong by you, Sophia.
[201:04.29]I see that now, and I want to make amends.
[201:07.41]Here, this is rightfully yours.
[201:09.87]Well, well.
[201:11.60]Look who comes crawling back.
[201:14.64]Leave us.
[201:22.13]You know, we lost three men because of you.
[201:25.23]Wickus was crushed by a rolling boulder.
[201:27.69]It's getting worse.
[201:30.37]We only escaped the arrows by using one of the local guides as a human shield.
[201:40.62]This is a nice gesture.
[201:41.90]What are we going to do to her?
[201:43.56]Imperial egg.
[201:45.46]May I?
[201:46.28]Fine.
[201:46.80]Money counter.
[201:47.62]Not too tight.
[201:50.10]You know, I thought about sending the boys after you.
[201:52.86]Grab the necklace and cut your throat ear to ear.
[201:55.71]You probably wonder why I didn't.
[201:57.95]The truth is, you beat us, Blake.
[202:00.27]I don't deny it.
[202:01.43]And I can't very well get... Both targets down.
[202:15.70]Impressive work, 47.
[202:17.38]And now to confront the constant.
[202:19.50]Kill switch.
[202:20.72]Mr. Gregor, what's your status?
[202:23.67]I'm at the helicopter, but the place is crawling with security.
[202:28.17]47, you better bring the constant to one of the boats in the harbor where it's quiet.
[202:31.79]Can I put her in the chair?
[202:32.47]You can use the kill switch to coerce.
[202:36.98]Can I put her in the chair like she's sitting in the chair?
[202:41.54]In the window.
[202:42.12]No, I'm not putting her in the window.
[202:44.14]Is he about to come in the room?
[202:48.21]Help Lucas Gray extract the optional.
[202:50.21]Talk to the constant.
[202:54.51]He's right here.
[203:05.99]The Washingtons are dead.
[203:07.81]I have the kill switch.
[203:09.13]What did you say?
[203:11.90]How could you know about that?
[203:13.50]You will head towards the harbor.
[203:15.68]No sudden moves.
[203:17.32]No signs or warnings.
[203:20.28]I will trigger the device if I need to.
[203:22.72]I know you.
[203:25.67]You have his eyes.
[203:27.94]You're Barnwood's assassin.
[203:30.34]Move.
[203:37.32]Everybody thinks I'm gonna do it, but I'm not gonna do it.
[203:40.77]Partners no more.
[203:42.53]I take it.
[203:44.55]I had a notion something didn't sit right with my mentor's betrayal.
[203:50.67]You murdered him.
[203:51.93]I take it to get to me.
[203:55.68]Not just that.
[203:57.22]He had it coming.
[203:58.34]No, I can't do it.
[204:01.00]I need to get two stars.
[204:02.98]If I don't get two stars, then what the hell?
[204:08.00]...specifically to target the seats of your emotions.
[204:11.86]Has Miss Burnwood's sense of justice rubbed off on you?
[204:15.83]I wonder.
[204:16.75]Just keep walking.
[204:17.87]The original five are all...
[204:26.92]Right, hello.
[204:54.11]What if it doesn't work?
[204:55.03]This is just an elaborate ruse and this doesn't even do anything?
[204:58.05]Jesus.
[205:24.16]Just test it to see if it works.
[205:25.58]Better test it to make sure.
[205:31.05]Make sure it works.
[205:32.51]Okay.
[205:33.03]I guess we'll make sure it works.
[205:37.77]Alright, it works.
[205:55.97]He's faking it.
[205:56.77]He could hear the button click.
[205:58.31]He heard that... Let me get that door for you.
[206:09.28]I take it this is not an ICA-sanctioned operation.
[206:14.20]What exactly does Miss Burnwood plan to achieve by targeting her clients, violating her own code?
[206:21.42]She's doing it for us.
[206:23.78]Us?
[206:26.15]Oh, I see.
[206:27.97]The penny drops.
[206:30.03]I should have known.
[206:32.13]How does a man leave no trace?
[206:35.19]Did I break and I broke it?
[206:38.58]Lucas Green.
[206:40.84]Did I?
[206:42.54]B. Or was it subject six?
[206:46.48]He died when the Institute... Oh, shit.
[206:50.77]So much for subtlety.
[206:52.27]Get out of there, 47.
[206:53.57]Mr. Gray will take it from here.
[207:03.04]Is it because I ran in front of him and opened the door?
[207:04.86]Damn it.
[207:20.62]Okay, we're almost there.
[207:22.52]CA section operation.
[207:28.24]What exactly does Mrs. Byrne plan to achieve by targeting her clients, violating her own code?
[207:35.48]She's doing it for us.
[207:37.88]Us?
[207:40.30]Oh, I see.
[207:42.10]Penny drops.
[207:44.15]I should have known.
[207:44.95]How does a man leave no trace?
[207:49.39]By not existing in the first place.
[207:52.69]Lucas Gray.
[207:54.87]Or was it subject six?
[207:57.09]This guy has my hair.
[207:58.07]Uh, nope.
[207:58.61]I don't have a bald spot on the top of my head.
[208:02.05]Sorry to disappoint you.
[208:03.25]But unlike you, his rage never faded.
[208:06.97]So, now you want the partners, the men behind the curtain who caused you all this pain?
[208:15.22]Well, before you go knocking down a wall, you better make sure it's not lone bearing.
[208:22.50]Yes, hello.
[208:24.84]Oh, you see there are more people above me.
[208:29.47]It's the water that does it.
[208:30.71]The first mission did the same thing.
[208:40.51]It's all these waves that are doing it for some reason.
[208:44.68]Disable water.
[208:46.20]You can't.
[208:47.46]I can't turn the water off.
[208:56.83]Oh, yay.
[208:57.21]Jesus!
[209:23.97]enough talking you'll do plenty of that later we're here get on the boat got him I mean that was that was pretty clean right like if I get zero stars then I mean
[209:51.64]It has to be all the times that I just keep reloading and doing stupid things.
[209:58.11]It was like clean enough to not have... I mean, it's gotta be because I'm fucking restarting and throwing people off balconies.
[210:29.89]Plus zero.
[210:30.71]It's because I've been killing people and shit.
[210:33.95]That's pretty clean.
[210:35.13]Alright, we can do the chapel, the gatehouse.
[210:37.47]We have this mace now.
[210:43.28]A mace.
[210:43.84]Lethal syringe.
[210:44.74]Finally unlocked the syringe.
[210:48.14]And here are the other options for this particular part of the game.
[210:51.72]We're on to the final area of Hitman 2.
[210:53.94]This is the last area, I believe.
[211:08.89]Final area, not final mission, obviously, because there are six places.
[211:19.02]Wasn't that the final area, was it?
[211:22.08]That was the last one.
[211:23.90]Oh, I thought there was another.
[211:27.44]I thought there was one more.
[211:33.78]Changing horses midstream?
[211:37.02]Truly unprofessional.
[211:40.73]You know what we want.
[211:45.35]Where is the carrot?
[211:47.25]No carrot.
[211:48.39]You're useless to the partners.
[211:50.33]Compromised.
[211:51.63]Even if we let you live, you can never return.
[211:54.05]Why die protecting them?
[211:57.06]When I can drag them down with me.
[212:01.04]It's a bad hand, but it's all you've got.
[212:09.84]All this for a bed sheet.
[212:40.22]Go.
[212:40.88]We can't give them time to retaliate.
[212:44.97]Don't take your eyes off him.
[212:50.71]He's gonna get out.
[212:51.41]Be careful.
[212:55.27]Well, here we are again.
[212:57.71]I must admit I am disappointed, Miss Burnwood.
[213:01.83]I had such big plans for you.
[213:05.85]Save it.
[213:06.39]He's gonna get out.
[213:07.07]I know the truth now.
[213:08.02]You're outplayed.
[213:09.70]You have nothing left to bargain with.
[213:12.51]You're so certain.
[213:14.83]So sure of the people closest to you.
[213:18.19]Was he a bad guy?
[213:18.97]He never fails, does he?
[213:21.03]He never misses his mark.
[213:25.54]You found a window into his past.
[213:31.48]And yet, something else remains hidden.
[213:41.43]So it was me the whole time.
[213:42.11]Diana!
[213:42.23]Coming!
[213:42.39]I did it.
[213:42.63]So I was the... I was the carrot all along, yeah.
[213:46.17]You're right.
[214:29.89]Oh, I did it.
[214:36.45]I don't understand the big reveal there.
[214:38.43]Did we do that in a previous game?
[214:40.31]Was that like Hitman 1?
[214:41.26]Look at all these people that made this great game.
[214:54.16]Alright.
[214:54.84]Um... Um... Um...
[215:03.13]next up re-plan mission replay mission exit to menu there's a lot of other things to do okay all right hold on wait a minute hold on a second here wait a minute hold on hold on here hold on a minute here
[215:38.46]What is this?
[215:55.90]It's the DLC, uh, from Hitman 1.
[216:04.77]What else?
[216:05.05]Okay, there's a sniper assassin mode, and then there's also ghost mode.
[216:10.70]I didn't even do this.
[216:12.40]Single player.
[216:16.46]This is like the demo, isn't it?
[216:20.82]Welcome to Austria, Agent 47.
[216:23.57]Your targets are Dorian Lang, Guillaume Maison, and Doris Lee.
[216:27.95]Three remaining members of the international gang of thieves known as the Yardbirds.
[216:31.47]The multiplayer is in beta.
[216:32.71]The Yardbirds were famous for the daring heists.
[216:35.53]In particular, one that took place against Shamal Casino in Las Vegas.
[216:39.34]What?
[216:39.58]However, this proved to be the property of organized criminals who in turn launched a campaign of violence and retaliation in an effort to identify the thieves and find the money.
[216:49.41]Feeling the earth burn beneath them, the Yardbirds entered into a secret agreement.
[216:53.85]The treasure would remain hidden, and once the dust settled, the last remaining member was to inherit everything.
[217:00.56]The group retired and all members vanished from sight until Calvin Ritter, the Sparrow, was found dead on his yacht.
[217:08.04]But the remaining members remained elusive.
[217:12.12]The group never gathers in one place, but today is a special occasion.
[217:16.44]The wedding of Elizabeth Lange is taking place at the palatial home of Guillaume Maison with Doris Lee as a special guest.
[217:24.04]Our client is Alexander Kovac, the founder of the Yardbirds.
[217:28.14]He has stipulated that all three targets and their bodyguards must be eliminated at this event.
[217:33.33]Should any of the Yardbirds escape, the contract is invalidated.
[217:37.67]Looks like Kovac is making his final bid for a loss of millions.
[217:43.53]All right.
[217:44.79]Eliminate everybody.
[217:46.37]I didn't do this.
[217:53.49]Kill them all.
[217:56.91]Agent and Mastery.
[217:57.97]Agent.
[217:58.67]47.
[217:58.69]Sure.
[218:00.78]Sieger.
[218:04.62]Extended Mag.
[218:05.40]Level 2.
[218:05.66]All right.
[218:06.78]You level up.
[218:11.64]Let's just do it.
[218:21.48]Good afternoon 47.
[218:22.36]The wedding ceremony is about to begin with Lang and his daughter arriving shortly by car.
[218:28.75]It is expected that they will proceed directly to the open area where the groom and priest is waiting, along with all the wedding guests.
[218:34.75]Is the multiplayer available right now?
[218:35.85]Guillaume Maison has been on site all day preparing the wedding details and entertaining guests.
[218:41.39]I expect he will also attend the ceremony.
[218:44.28]Doris Lee is en route via helicopter and should be arriving any minute now.
[218:49.22]My intel suggests she will not be watching the bride and groom exchange vows.
[218:53.12]It's Battle Royale.
[218:54.32]No, it is not, is it?
[218:55.38]We are working within a limited window of opportunity here, 47.
[218:59.14]We expect the targets to stay for no longer than 15 minutes.
[219:03.08]I don't believe that.
[219:15.03]Hahaha.
[219:44.41]Alright, let's do it.
[219:49.41]So we got guy in the window, people showing up by car.
[220:02.47]Just wait till they all get to the ceremony.
[220:04.52]He's in the car, he's in the window.
[220:12.22]This is the mobile game.
[220:16.39]It's a flash game.
[220:21.49]Yeah, this was the teaser though, wasn't it?
[220:33.75]Wasn't this the precursor to Hitman 2 releasing?
[220:40.81]I think I can handle it.
[220:43.12]Once he gets close enough, I'll try to take out one, two, three.
[220:49.09]Just play the stickman sniper game.
[220:51.79]Oh my god, that's a long time ago.
[220:53.51]Alright, where is he?
[220:57.26]That is Guillaume Maison, the Kingfisher.
[221:00.62]Former Interpol agent and the owner of the mansion and its grounds.
[221:10.18]So who's this then?
[221:11.44]That is Doris Lee, aka the Goldfinch.
[221:15.78]Former Hollywood stuntwoman of Cheyenne descent.
[221:24.21]That is Dorian Lang, the Red Robin, former military engineer and father of the bride.
[221:31.58]47, the situation is about to become critical.
[221:33.94]Lang is down.
[221:35.12]Nice work, 47.
[221:36.76]Lee has been eliminated.
[221:37.90]Good work, 47.
[221:47.15]Oh shit, I got a bridesmaid.
[221:48.37]Oh fuck!
[222:17.85]And they got it.
[222:20.21]Nice work, 47.
[222:47.44]Nice long jump.
[223:17.79]They're just shooting up here.
[223:19.35]Nobody can hit me.
[223:24.38]Oh my god, this sensitivity.
[223:28.46]Wait, DPI.
[223:29.24]1, 2, 3, DPI up.
[224:36.72]Someone's getting away.
[224:37.21]Who's getting away?
[225:30.13]Yes!
[225:40.54]Nice work, 47.
[225:41.24]OK.
[225:41.32]That was fun, I guess.
[226:00.05]There's not many ways to do that.
[226:11.39]Now do ghost mode.
[226:12.25]Yeah, okay.
[226:15.83]Oh, my DPI.
[226:16.45]Alright, let's try the multiplayer.
[226:21.17]See what it's like.
[226:23.31]Ghost mode.
[226:31.53]um okay briefing eliminate eliminate targets to gain points and beat your opponent find opponent quick match game rules I kind of need to know what the hell happens here
[226:56.33]Have you ever wondered what it would be like to face off against another assassin?
[227:01.07]Same starting point, same starting time, same starting targets.
[227:05.93]Are we in the same game?
[227:07.37]The first player with five eliminations is the winner.
[227:10.45]Targets are randomly selected every time, so no duel will be the same.
[227:15.42]Since you start off with no equipment, you'll need to improvise.
[227:19.38]Find ghost crates and grab disguises as you go.
[227:22.55]Can we see each other?
[227:23.45]If your opponent scores a kill, you'll have limited time to react.
[227:27.98]Will you risk blowing your cover?
[227:30.46]Be careful.
[227:31.50]A spotted kill does not count.
[227:33.83]Does not count?
[227:35.53]You exist in separate realities.
[227:38.13]So a messy, chaotic approach on your end does not affect your opponent.
[227:42.77]That's unfortunate.
[227:43.65]Quite the contrary.
[227:44.76]While you're busy cleaning up or running for your life, your opponent is free to advance like a ghost.
[227:50.50]Be cunning, be creative, be ruthless.
[227:54.62]Good luck.
[227:55.30]That's kind of unfortunate.
[227:59.51]I guess you kind of have to do something like that, though.
[228:02.53]Because... How would you ever do this?
[228:05.67]Somebody would just throw grenades.
[228:07.68]And it would just ruin everything.
[228:12.30]I'm going up against Coca-Cola.
[228:31.42]It would just be a cesspool game mode.
[228:33.30]Yeah, it wouldn't work.
[228:39.86]It'd be fun to do something like that Assassin's Creed game mode where you... What was that game that I played where you hit around and you had to get... So can we actually see each other though?
[228:51.84]I guess we can see each other.
[228:58.69]Your opponent is now disguised.
[229:27.99]Silent takedown.
[229:55.57]Ah, you're following me!
[229:59.34]Wait, why?
[230:02.70]Target eliminated.
[230:04.64]Why are we the same target?
[230:14.75]I got it before he did.
[230:16.41]What's going on?
[230:20.99]next target nine so it's just a race to get to the guy okay this is way cooler this is not new target find and eliminate good news your opponent died your opponent is back in the fight
[230:51.42]good news wait is he upstairs damn it
[231:21.35]Good news.
[231:23.45]Wait, is he done?
[231:31.72]Slingshot past him going into the corner.
[231:34.50]Where the fuck?
[231:40.70]He used to race against Robert Knox back when he was a patient racer.
[231:48.12]Yes, sir.
[231:48.32]I don't know.
[232:07.90]Go go over it Your opponent killed the target
[232:16.16]warning target will be lost in 15 seconds target lost oh okay I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I understand six five wait a minute four three two I understand it now one so it doesn't matter target I get it find and eliminate so wait why did why does he only have one snake in the bush here take him down again well where's his point
[232:45.22]How come he doesn't have a point right now?
[232:46.30]Is it because I killed it in time?
[232:53.25]He got noticed too.
[232:53.99]Okay.
[232:54.59]When does this end?
[232:56.43]Your opponent changed disguise.
[233:16.11]Your opponent changed disguise.
[233:19.51]He's down.
[233:23.87]Trevor Jones just wants to put California behind him and get on him.
[233:27.45]Stay in the race for as long as possible.
[233:29.07]He is down.
[233:29.49]He's going to the garage.
[233:31.87]For new covers to Endurance Racing, let me remind you that this is different from Grand Prix and that it's all about which team can win.
[233:38.50]I've got to get down to the garage.
[233:40.22]Fuel efficiency and reliability.
[233:44.91]I gotta go down the stairs.
[233:46.37]Neither one of us can get him, apparently.
[233:48.92]Warning.
[233:49.08]Target will be lost in 15 seconds.
[233:52.22]Warning.
[233:53.00]Target will be lost in 10 seconds.
[233:54.96]8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[233:57.28]Damn it!
[233:59.27]Find and eliminate.
[234:18.05]Your opponent changed disguise.
[234:30.70]I'm not even changing disguises.
[234:36.86]It has to be a stealth kill, that's right.
[234:39.72]Alright.
[234:41.70]I got the jump on this one.
[234:42.96]He's up there.
[234:48.57]This race is not over until the clock ticks down.
[234:51.92]I'm telling you, Miss Knox is going to be pissed.
[234:54.52]I did the pre-race.
[234:55.12]Well, let's just say she's out of bad news.
[234:58.96]See, you just... What's this?
[235:01.42]It doesn't matter how strong you are.
[235:04.01]There's always going to be someone pushing you, someone bumping into you.
[235:07.17]How do you want it?
[235:08.97]It's how you respond.
[235:10.45]It decides where you'll finish at the end of the day.
[235:12.75]Yeah, we do.
[235:13.75]Sure.
[235:22.95]Eliminated.
[235:23.93]He's in a bird costume.
[235:32.61]Clean kill.
[235:35.51]Score two to one.
[235:38.20]Wait, give me that costume.
[235:39.58]Score two to two.
[235:41.98]Two to two?
[235:43.66]Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[235:46.58]Hold on, wait, wait, where did he get the extra point from?
[235:49.54]Three, two, one.
[235:53.33]Um... Pool ball.
[235:55.03]Alright, I got a pool ball.
[235:59.08]Yeah, what was the extra point?
[236:06.16]Can't go this way.
[236:12.58]Yeah, we both killed the same guy, though.
[236:34.52]Give me this disguise, come on!
[236:36.88]Prime noticed by somebody.
[236:38.16]Who the fuck saw it?
[236:39.02]Oh, fuck you.
[236:43.12]Probably will.
[237:02.33]I'm still... What is happening here?
[237:08.57]Get out of the way!
[237:11.45]What the fuck are you... I can't vault over that.
[237:14.85]Oh my goodness.
[237:25.69]I can't vault over that either.
[237:32.72]I can't unlock that.
[237:33.74]Shit.
[237:34.08]Gotta go down.
[237:35.12]I gotta go down, I gotta go down, I gotta go down.
[237:37.88]I have no items.
[238:07.46]Snap his neck.
[238:08.58]Frame rate, why?
[238:09.46]Is there anything in here?
[238:25.70]What the fuck is happening?
[238:28.60]What are you talking about?
[238:29.29]Is this guy in the game too?
[238:30.89]He's up.
[238:31.15]He's this way up or...
[238:56.54]I'm secured, though.
[238:57.16]I should be fine.
[238:58.18]Your opponent changed disguise.
[239:26.55]Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[239:29.15]This is where I take the lead, right here.
[239:31.84]This is where I take the lead.
[239:35.08]Did I not get it?
[239:55.14]Your kill was witnessed.
[239:56.70]Fucking god damn it.
[239:57.74]Let me just repeat some ground rules for those of you who knew.
[240:01.46]You killed a non-target.
[240:02.88]What?
[240:04.04]I lost a point for that.
[240:05.10]I lost.
[240:05.94]How did he see me do that?
[240:10.12]Five.
[240:11.20]Four.
[240:12.18]Three.
[240:12.86]Good news.
[240:13.88]Your opponent died.
[240:16.07]New target.
[240:17.21]Find and eliminate.
[240:18.31]So that's what happened.
[240:19.57]That's what happened to him.
[240:21.61]Oh my fucking god.
[240:22.39]Just get me out of the game already.
[240:23.85]He's gonna win.
[240:25.55]If you kill somebody that's not the target, you lose a full point.
[240:49.08]That's a rage quit right there.
[240:50.42]Like, what the fuck?
[240:52.22]Guy gets behind and the security camera sees me.
[240:54.34]That's why it got compromised.
[240:55.58]That's such bullshit.
[241:13.90]Why would you even give this to me?
[241:15.76]How the hell are you supposed to use this without being seen?
[241:31.95]Careful your enemy will still recognize you
[241:52.13]Yeah.
[241:52.67]I know.
[241:54.71]I had a chance, and then I threw it away.
[241:56.41]Good.
[241:56.69]I hope he wins.
[241:57.59]I would've won the game, too.
[241:58.91]Just kill me!
[242:23.38]Just, just go win.
[242:25.68]Here, let me like open the door for you.
[242:33.86]I'll go scout it out up here.
[242:35.38]I hope he uses it well.
[242:55.52]I don't see how this works.
[243:07.99]I have no item, so... I'm not allowed to be in here.
[243:15.68]Is it a camera?
[243:16.36]If it's a camera, I swear to God...
[243:27.84]I'm knocking off.
[243:33.61]Like, why would they give you guns like this?
[243:35.15]I wanna see what happens if I do this.
[243:39.85]Target eliminated.
[243:41.21]Your kill was witnessed.
[243:44.78]You killed a non-target.
[243:46.58]Score, zero to three.
[243:51.06]Nine.
[243:54.38]6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[243:58.02]Killed a non-target.
[244:02.18]Score 0 to 4.
[244:03.75]How can you just kill him?
[244:07.99]He's in there.
[244:08.87]Is there a forfeit button?
[244:11.01]Just exit.
[244:23.46]Congratulations, you won.
[244:30.22]Alright, well, wait a minute.
[244:31.44]It just quit me out of the whole game.
[244:32.53]Oh, it's updating now.
[244:37.99]I have an update to download.
[244:42.77]Why is this the second time this has done this?
[244:52.39]No, I was doing fine.
[244:53.75]That's the first time I've ever even seen that game mode, first of all.
[244:56.79]Second of all, killing somebody that's not a target, you lose a full point?
[245:02.83]Is that the way to make it so you never, don't ever do anything bad?
[245:07.56]Is that like the anti-grief to make it so you just go to zero and you just lose?
[245:11.12]If you shoot somebody that's not a guy that you need to go after?
[245:20.03]Because if you play into five points, losing one point is a total disaster.
[245:25.39]It's a complete disaster.
[245:31.43]Only play into five.
[245:32.45]And the only way you can get a point... You'll never make it to Hitman 2 Nationals.
[245:45.26]I want to try that again.
[245:46.22]Now knowing that that's going to happen.
[246:09.23]Guns exist to stop someone else from getting a point if you don't have time to get unnoticed and kill.
[246:18.69]But wouldn't you lose a point?
[246:24.59]So you shoot the guy from far away, not if they're the target.
[246:35.54]But that makes it so they can't get the point.
[246:38.30]Wouldn't that person be alive in their mode?
[246:41.12]I thought it was separate realities.
[246:51.98]If you point it, you can't get to him in 20 seconds.
[246:54.28]Alright, well let's do it again.
[246:55.05]Let's try it again.
[247:09.83]But how did he get two points?
[247:24.38]Because he had two points that one time after one person.
[247:28.26]He got a costume bonus?
[247:43.20]No, that's not even real.
[247:44.70]There's no costume bonus.
[247:56.73]There was a syncing issue?
[247:57.81]Oh.
[248:13.56]Okay, let's try this again.
[248:16.03]Agent, get ready.
[248:16.95]Duel starts in 10 seconds.
[248:19.74]Nine, eight.
[248:20.86]What the hell are we?
[248:21.78]Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[248:29.04]Eliminate the target.
[248:30.38]All right, what we got here?
[248:35.58]Crowbar, brick.
[248:37.50]I'll take it.
[248:38.72]Your opponent is now disguised.
[248:40.76]Wait, where'd you get that disguise?
[248:46.11]Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[248:56.28]He's waiting for me.
[248:58.98]He's waiting for me.
[249:00.52]That was so nice of you.
[249:02.10]He's like, okay, you ready?
[249:05.35]All right.
[249:09.31]No, I'm going to run over.
[249:10.57]Security, you look well prepared.
[249:13.59]What?
[249:58.06]I'm actually in the co-op mode.
[250:03.01]Huh?
[250:06.85]Stay put.
[250:08.05]Find something to hide behind.
[250:11.67]Was this an accident, do you think?
[250:13.05]Or, I mean... Target eliminated.
[250:20.66]Your kill was witnessed.
[250:28.89]next target in 10 seconds your opponent killed the target and nobody noticed it nobody noticed his kill no he's like running around punching people and eliminate
[250:55.77]He didn't use a brick.
[250:56.77]Well, he got noticed.
[250:58.63]What is going on here?
[251:00.09]Who's firing?
[251:00.85]Is he coming up here?
[251:05.69]Nope.
[251:24.47]This is not a bathroom.
[251:25.81]I thought this was a bathroom.
[251:28.35]What do we got?
[251:41.80]Ghost coin.
[251:43.96]What the hell?
[251:48.78]Warning target will be lost in 15 seconds In 10 seconds, I don't think this is where are you coming from get out of here 6 5 4 3 2 1 Going on here find and eliminate Change disguise
[252:19.95]Alright, well, it's zero to zero.
[252:23.05]Alright, so when you... I'm automatically just still... I don't get to start over?
[252:41.61]I just come out and I'm in combat still.
[252:51.12]Yeah, I know she just said that, but that's still, like, where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[252:57.16]I'm still hunted, so I'll just pull the guy in the fucking tank top aside and take his tank top?
[253:04.78]I can't even take his disguise.
[253:18.86]I need a disguise.
[253:23.41]Your opponent just picked up a weapon.
[253:30.41]I can't take the disguise.
[253:31.59]I can't take that guy's clothes.
[253:40.07]Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[253:45.13]Wow.
[253:51.64]The upper down, he's down.
[253:54.52]I need a disguise.
[253:55.74]Your opponent killed the target.
[253:58.06]God, I'm gonna lose.
[254:05.69]You are losing.
[254:06.77]Assert yourself.
[254:08.11]Okay.
[254:09.87]Score, zero to one.
[254:13.21]I'll assert myself.
[254:13.99]Anybody here?
[254:14.61]What?
[254:14.77]Hold on.
[254:15.01]I don't even want to play this anymore.
[254:16.43]I don't think this is very fun.
[254:17.17]I really don't.
[254:43.56]Your opponent changed disguise.
[254:50.71]Back in the fight.
[254:52.19]Careful, your enemy will still recognize you.
[254:55.15]Yeah, I know.
[255:05.02]So I... Oh my fucking god.
[255:10.95]This is the same outfit.
[255:12.19]It's the same guy.
[255:13.25]It's just... I'm already out.
[255:20.39]That just hit me.
[255:21.55]I just killed me.
[255:23.07]I don't know where to put him.
[255:39.74]Someone's gonna come in here.
[255:50.09]Gotta go up.
[255:52.12]Can I get up through here?
[256:17.88]Alright, I don't have any items.
[256:19.42]I need to like find something to kill him with silently.
[256:33.79]Christ.
[256:37.19]Oh, God.
[256:38.42]Give me a break.
[256:39.20]Don't move!
[256:45.82]You can't be here, sir.
[256:52.33]Yeah, I have a mini... I know I have a mini-map, but, like, I have to find something.
[257:02.19]I hate it.
[257:05.44]I don't want to play it anymore.
[257:17.36]I hate that.
[257:34.43]Wait, I can't do this?
[257:36.45]No.
[257:45.37]Do the patch notes.
[257:55.49]I want to do this.
[257:56.17]I'm going to go back to here.
[258:08.21]I mean, I understood how it all worked.
[258:10.52]It just... It just seems... Like... I don't know.
[258:19.63]I just don't... I didn't like it at all.
[258:22.51]There's more multiplayer?
[258:23.77]What?
[258:28.45]Is there?
[258:28.69]This is the only one that's here.
[258:50.62]I already did the sniper mode.
[258:58.50]I know I'm not a great hitman player, but... I just want to scream right now about how much I hate that fucking game mode.
[259:11.11]I just want to yell it as loud as I can.
[259:28.01]All right.
[259:29.99]Create a contract.
[259:31.21]Contract search.
[259:34.87]Trending.
[259:39.41]Easy.
[259:40.64]With a heart.
[259:43.84]Let's do easy.
[259:49.40]Easy.
[259:52.90]By salt.
[259:54.76]This one's trending.
[260:09.82]Eliminate Christopher May.
[260:14.94]Alright.
[260:26.17]Are you serious?
[260:34.93]That's it, okay.
[260:37.69]That's it, just shoot him and hit the button.
[260:41.68]Is this what you wanted?
[260:43.18]How do I get a two star?
[260:49.74]Hold on, I'm gonna replay this mission.
[260:52.42]Let's get a five star on easy.
[261:04.66]Okay.
[261:07.48]So what do I have for items?
[261:08.92]Just fiber wire, okay.
[261:12.51]So, I'm gonna coin this guy and fiberwire him.
[261:23.07]I'm so... I'm so tilted right now.
[261:27.24]From that fucking multiplayer mode.
[261:29.50]I... I just need like a... I need like a stress ball to bite it with my teeth.
[262:03.37]Ugh!
[262:40.40]I think I have to stop playing.
[262:55.48]I have to stop playing.
[262:56.22]I'm so... Oh my god.
[263:24.74]Alright.
[263:26.34]I gotta get ready for tomorrow.
[263:55.22]That game will really- Oh, I'm so upset.
[264:10.09]Uh, so tomorrow is the green screen stream.
[264:12.73]Mm-hmm.
[264:24.45]Now, that should be a lot of fun.
[264:25.41]Tomorrow afternoon.
[264:26.17]Why not some more ghost mode?
[264:39.61]No, I'm never opening that ever again.
[264:45.32]I really don't know what time...
[264:51.46]I think it's kind of whenever I want to start it, I think.
[264:57.58]But actually, let's do this now.
[264:59.26]Yeah, I'm out of here.
[265:08.73]Because there are some things I need to do, and I'm going to freak out if I don't get out of here.
[265:14.59]Like this game.
[265:26.31]Why would they put that in the options menu?
[265:30.65]Anyways.
[265:37.44]Let me get this back to you guys.
[265:40.90]Tomorrow, probably around... Let's see.
[265:43.66]1, 2, 3, 4.
[265:45.60]I'm going to try... I'm assuming it's going to happen around 12 or 1 Pacific.
[265:49.18]So... Probably around 3 to 4 Eastern is when it's going to start.
[266:00.29]I had a poll might as well to show it one more time One of the mods have that poll for the memes Because I have it somewhere here and this would take me a minute to find it there it is So there were a lot of responses Take a look there
[266:29.02]And it looks like... I'll leave this open for like five minutes.
[266:41.58]It looks like the top three are JoJo poses, CSI Sunglass one-liners, and Infinity War stuff.
[266:52.31]So, I'm going to have to look up some of those.
[266:57.04]I know there's already some highly requested ones.
[267:08.03]But... Oh, let me see here.
[267:24.38]Yeah, so that's what it's going to be.
[267:26.56]It will be these listed here.
[267:31.85]And with that, if you want to take off, I'll see you tomorrow.
[267:37.63]Probably around 4 to 5 p.m.
[267:41.41]Eastern.
[267:44.05]I'd say between like 4 and 7 Eastern.
[267:46.70]I'm going to try to start at the typical time, so...
[267:53.06]I'm trying to think of anything else to talk about here.
[267:59.19]Before I go, I'm just sitting here trying to think.
[268:07.86]Uh, Deltarune.
[268:08.94]I will play Deltarune probably at a later date.
[268:16.56]Not right now.
[268:20.95]because I have to go to Best Buy or Walmart or Target or something because there are still like at least a couple dozen things that I still need and I need to go while they're still open so I'm not entirely sure which one of these stores I'm going to be going to
[268:56.30]It is a good question.
[269:03.50]Because there's still props that I need.
[269:04.74]I bought some stuff, but I need... Whoa!
[269:09.48]Subs coming in.
[269:13.56]Uh, thank you.
[269:15.70]To... Ampharic for the five community subs.
[269:20.86]Have some subs before you go.
[269:22.06]Well, thank you, dude.
[269:27.56]Means a lot.
[269:27.98]Thanks a lot.
[269:30.26]Yeah, because the thing that I need to buy... I was looking at online... And you have to kind of get it at like a Target or a Best Buy or something like that.
[269:46.53]I need to see.
[269:47.01]I know there's like a shitload of like... Best Buys, Walmarts, Targets.
[269:51.79]They're everywhere around here, so... This is Las Vegas.
[269:55.05]They are fucking everywhere.
[269:59.13]All right, let's do the bits.
[270:05.62]He's an inflatable microphone.
[270:11.52]No.
[270:12.04]Take care, everybody.
[270:12.98]See you soon.
[270:15.00]Yeah, it's time for me to read.
[270:18.18]So, with that, thank you for $3 to Hasnain.
[270:20.58]Thanks for the three bucks.

[270:35.02]Jesus!
[270:38.74]You still had the mic on!

[271:10.12]Thank you so much, dude.
[271:11.34]But, Jesus.
[271:15.63]ZeroSue, thanks for the $1.50.
[271:17.33]Thanks for starting the stream the second I got home and turned on the tub.
[271:20.57]Too bad I had to kill a lot of rats today at work.
[271:23.43]Sorry to hear that.
[271:24.67]I'm sorry about the rats, too.
[271:29.48]But thank you, Zerosu.
[271:30.34]Thank you, Hasnain, again for a dollar.
[271:31.60]Have a report for Uni of Nin for tomorrow.

[271:39.63]Have fun, though.
[271:43.21]Thank you, Hasnain.
[271:47.27]Hey, Mad.
[271:48.05]Thank you, Mad47 for the one dollar.
[271:49.68]Can we expect a one-on-one cage match between Jermis Conscious and the chat telling him to drown a woman in a toilet in the next Rumble?
[272:02.00]What?
[272:04.54]Thank you.
[272:06.03]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the one dollar.
[272:07.69]Jeremy, I'm running away from Smiley Dons.
[272:11.25]They're a kind of ancient Toon tribe.
[272:13.85]Whoa, that was close.
[272:16.49]Remember how you made me your feline ambassador?
[272:20.93]I mean, you are.
[272:21.47]You're the only cat I think that watches.
[272:25.40]Uh, well, the Goodwill tour turned sour real quick.
[272:28.92]Just showed them Otto's Big Adventure and they flipped out at me.
[272:31.64]You got no idea how much, uh, it's been finding a place in this temple with Wi-Fi.
[272:35.82]What the fuck?
[272:38.74]I'm so lost.
[272:39.99]Thank you, Garfield, for the $1.
[272:43.77]What the fuck?
[272:50.69]Thank you, Wince Rind, for the $3.
[272:57.87]I just finished fall quarter and totally nailed my art history exam.
[273:01.55]And yes, I'm paying money to boast about this.
[273:04.69]Congratulations.
[273:10.44]Hopefully he did well.
[273:13.56]Fall quarter.
[273:16.74]So is the first semester of college and university done at this point?
[273:23.35]Semesters are weird because some of them start in September, some start in January, right?
[273:31.18]Uh, midterms, okay.
[273:32.42]I see.
[273:33.68]Not yet.
[273:34.12]Okay.
[273:36.08]But, uh, congratulations, dude.
[273:37.14]Thanks a lot for the three bucks.
[273:39.68]Maddy Numbers, thanks for the $10, Maddy Numbers.
[273:41.92]When are you going to finish your Hitman Absolution Let's Play?
[273:46.56]I will finish it after doing Ghost Mode.
[273:49.24]Uh, three more times.
[273:51.22]And the answer to that, that means it's never happening.
[273:57.93]But thank you for the $10, dude.
[273:59.35]Appreciate it.
[274:01.03]Flubbaga, thanks for the $1.
[274:02.25]Hey, Jeremy, you hear about Nolan Cassidy?
[274:04.83]Poor sucker drowned himself in his own vomit and put himself in the bathroom wardrobe.
[274:10.39]That's fucked up.
[274:12.17]I can't believe that happened.
[274:16.88]Thank you, Teetles, for the $2.40.
[274:19.08]No messages, just thank you, dude.
[274:22.44]AnonymousGifter gave the $10, not the $10, the 10 community subs earlier.
[274:28.76]Thank you so much, dude.
[274:31.87]It's a lot of community subs.
[274:33.15]Hopefully... Hopefully people... Is there a way to tell?
[274:39.21]I can see who got them, but... I wonder if... I wonder what the actual algorithm here is.
[274:48.22]Is it possible just to get one if you've already been subscribed?
[274:50.92]I wonder if there's a wait on it.
[274:53.62]Somewhere in the back end.
[274:54.54]So they just show up as regular subs.
[274:58.14]Okay, that's cool.
[274:59.24]Well, congratulations to everybody, and thank you for even doing that, man.
[275:02.79]Spicy Mans, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[275:04.19]Going through a really hard time right now.
[275:05.45]Thanks for the laughs.
[275:06.59]Hoping to sub soon.

[275:12.24]Twice here, so.
[275:14.70]Thank you for even considering.
[275:15.96]Thanks a lot, man.
[275:18.08]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[275:19.22]Do you think you'd be able to fight off a man your size but with more ambition if he challenged you to a fight?
[275:26.71]Yeah.
[275:27.93]I would kick the shit out of myself.
[275:31.26]Definitely.
[275:32.68]Uh, Stop It gave $1.45.
[275:34.64]Thanks a lot, Stop It.

[275:43.81]Thanks.
[275:45.39]Uh, Coable, thanks for the $5.
[275:47.82]The smoke from the wildfire here in California is so bad I can't leave the house.
[275:52.26]So, thank you for keeping me entertained while I'm stuck inside.
[275:56.56]Uh, stay safe, be careful.
[276:01.07]I'm glad to be hanging out here.
[276:06.82]Hopefully, you don't see anything too bad from that.
[276:10.51]Take care.
[276:10.91]If you're in California, take care of yourselves, guys.
[276:16.07]Much love to you.
[276:18.52]Uh, it's Roosgara, thanks for the $1.
[276:21.85]Hey Germs, just dropping in and noticed that you pronounced my name.
[276:23.97]It's Roos-a-gara, but it's actually... It truss... It truss-gara.
[276:30.21]Citrus-gara.
[276:32.53]Like citrus and gara.
[276:34.13]Anyway, I gotta go.
[276:34.83]Oh, okay.
[276:36.38]Cool.
[276:38.66]I get you.
[276:39.12]Thanks.
[276:41.84]Thank you.
[276:43.54]For the $1 and correcting my pronunciation.
[276:46.98]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[276:48.02]I am from the future and wanted to tell you that it was a good stream tomorrow.
[276:50.70]Just don't eat that spider.
[276:54.40]Gross.
[276:56.35]I gotta get out of here.
[276:57.21]I gotta go.
[276:59.83]E-Cookie, thanks for the $1.
[277:01.01]If you were an instrument, what type of instrument would you be?

[277:07.61]Thanks, though, dude.
[277:08.17]Thank you, DivUSP, for the $3.
[277:08.95]Thanks a lot.

[277:16.08]Talix gave $2.
[277:17.36]Thank you, Talix.
[277:19.86]Kraken recently started his Ghost Commander series, where he sends four actors into a haunted house in order to hunt a ghost.
[277:27.18]At the same time, chat is able to either help the actors by voting on what they do, or help the ghost by voting on how it scares the actors.
[277:34.22]This sounds a lot similar to the things you wanted to do, a style, uh, Twitch TV show with chat interaction.
[277:39.86]Can we possibly expect a collab in the future?
[277:43.78]If it happens, it happens.
[277:47.48]Yeah, there are plenty of things that I want to do.
[277:51.64]And if our paths cross, our paths cross.
[277:57.50]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[278:05.05]We shall see.
[278:06.77]But thanks for the two bucks, Talix.
[278:08.59]That sounds really fucking cool.
[278:11.35]Hey, uh, Julis, Julis, Julis, Julis.

[278:21.27]I usually don't subscribe to anyone but you.
[278:23.53]Do you subscribe to anyone on Twitch?
[278:24.89]Do you have a favorite Twitch streamer?
[278:26.19]By the way, so far you are my favorite.

[278:30.76]For the $1.
[278:31.00]Uh, do I have a favorite Twitch streamer?
[278:35.20]Um... Not necessarily.
[278:43.29]I think that... Say italics, Vinny.
[278:49.82]I mean, I think like the friends and the people that I like that I know on here, I would probably recommend their channels just because that's kind of how I found them in the first place.
[279:00.67]But I think I don't necessarily have like somebody that I watch that I'm like, oh, that's my favorite streamer.
[279:13.11]But, yeah, I mean, I would say any of my friends that I know on the platform are people that I would highly recommend.
[279:21.81]He likes himself the most.
[279:25.01]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[279:26.57]Thank you, Creepy Ghost Sales, for the $1.
[279:28.77]Hey, Jeremy, here's the last of my free bits.

[279:40.07]See you then.
[279:43.04]Yeah.
[279:43.84]I mean, that's... Not... I'm glad you're able to... Participate and have fun on the streams, but... And also, I'm sorry to hear about... You having to deal with that shit.
[279:54.66]It sucks.
[279:56.03]But just be careful.

[282:35.53]Mario Tennis All Alone.
[282:36.55]No, that's not even close to the level.
[282:38.11]Maybe it was.
[282:41.03]How bad was Mario Tennis in regards to how mad I was at Ghost Mode?
[282:45.99]Combine the two.
[282:59.27]Mario Tennis was about the same.
[283:05.07]Mario Tennis was three or two times as bad.
[283:08.01]Mario Tennis was way worse.
[283:09.85]I love how that's the... That's like the barometer there.
[283:23.08]Alright, is it... Was it Mario Tennis levels of fucking meltdown?
[283:28.23]Mario Tennis you were upset for like two hours.
[283:42.05]But, like, alright, here, here, let me, let me, like, let me just speak my piece, right?
[283:47.18]Like, if I, if I'm, like, doing really bad, and, like, I don't, like, I'm angry at losing, or something going wrong that I don't like, and I look over at chat, and everyone's like, oh my god, you're so stupid, like, you're so bad, you're so dumb, and I'm just like, I can't, I can't get it!
[284:02.30]You know what I mean?
[284:02.92]Like, ugh.
[284:08.86]You know what I'm saying?
[284:09.38]It's like a, it's like a perfect trifecta.
[284:18.76]It's like all three of those things have to be happening at the same time.
[284:23.66]Fucking Mario Tennis.
[284:25.66]The curve bullshit.
[284:27.56]I... I never thought I was gonna think about that.
[284:30.13]Now I'm twice as mad.
[284:42.03]I'm gonna have a nightmare tonight.
[284:43.89]That I'm playing Mario Tennis and Ghost Mode at the same time.
[284:59.42]We've sent him into a rage spiral.
[285:01.22]Call Animal Control.
[285:03.92]Hey, don't ever bring it up to me.
[285:05.12]Don't ever bring it up.
[285:06.50]Don't ever bring up Animal Control.
[285:09.01]These are three things never to bring up on one of these streams.
[285:11.89]Never bring up Animal Control, Mario Tennis, or Ghost Mode.
[285:15.35]Or Skate 3.
[285:17.17]Or Karazhan.
[285:29.21]What's wrong with the first?
[285:30.11]Nothing.
[285:30.89]Nothing at all.
[285:33.29]Alright, that's it.
[285:35.69]I will see you guys all tomorrow.
[285:37.15]Devakitty gave $1 here, right there, right now.
[285:39.26]GermanJaxx, GermanJaxx2, GermanComet, GermanPluto.
[285:42.14]Thank you.
[285:45.00]DoubleD with $1 right here.
[285:46.26]Anyway, what's the update on the spider-crab situation?
[285:48.62]How many frogs have you put into each room?
[285:50.90]Oh, there's a frog in every room.
[285:53.06]We're good.
[285:55.02]They have plenty of water.
[286:01.81]But thanks everybody for watching.
[286:03.23]Here come the credits.
[286:04.27]All the new subs.
[286:06.75]And old ones.
[286:11.51]So I will see you all tomorrow for the green screen stream.
[286:15.15]It should be interesting.
[286:21.10]I can promise you that.
[286:26.36]Somewhere around...
[286:28.10]Between 4 and 7 p.m.
[286:30.06]Eastern Time is when the stream will probably start.
[286:33.91]If not, I will absolutely let you know.
[286:37.33]It will be happening tomorrow, though.
[286:38.87]That's for sure.
[286:47.69]Good night, everybody.
[286:50.33]Thanks again for watching.
[286:52.59]Oh, my Hitman.
[286:53.82]Okay, so by raiding for Hitman...
[286:58.60]All the new areas were fun.
[287:00.54]I think the first area and the last area were the best ones in regards to how interesting I thought they were for... I mean, you can't really racetrack like a cult mansion.
[287:12.61]Those are pretty amazing.
[287:13.75]Seems like there's a lot of content.
[287:23.89]I would say give the multiplayer a try if you really are into pain and stuff that's not fun at all.
[287:41.01]I brought it up again.
[287:41.75]Alright, alright.
[287:43.39]The multiplayer mode is good.
[287:49.07]I just didn't understand it at first, and when I finally understood it, I lost my mind because I was getting fucking beat.
[287:54.93]And then, it spiraled out of control after I shot that security guard.
[287:58.42]Everything was just fine.
[288:04.38]It was fun, and things were going well, and then I started to hate it.
[288:15.43]You still don't understand it.
[288:18.51]Well, am I supposed to understand how every single thing in it works in the first game mo- first time I ever play it?
[288:25.45]Watching a YouTube briefing video about how to play it?
[288:39.42]You've rage quit both times.
[288:42.53]That doesn't mean I will... I mean, I'm never gonna play it again, but if I did, I would take it slower and... Hit the deck.
[288:55.54]What is this?
[288:55.98]Fuck you.
[289:00.00]You guys suck.
[289:09.45]That's from Dark Souls.
[289:28.02]What the fuck was that?
[289:30.72]Somebody links me that clip like every couple of months here or every like...
[289:44.63]Is that what I was doing dur- okay, I need to- what was I doing?
[289:47.41]What is that?
[289:48.69]Was I doing that during the... ghost mode?
[289:53.78]I don't remember doing any- I just remember being angry.
[290:06.11]Anybody have a clip during ghost mode when I- was that my worst?
[290:14.50]Because I will definitely watch an embarrassing meltdown right here.
[290:25.72]You were going, oh my god.
[290:27.98]You walk up into a food stand.
[290:33.61]The woman running it looks at you and says, Okay.
[290:47.05]I can even see the thumbnail for that one.
[290:48.97]Like, I don't know what that is at this point.
[290:52.41]I can see the thumbnail.
[291:08.79]Everything in this whole area.
[291:12.55]Oh my god!
[291:15.47]Oh my god, look at how far away I am!
[291:20.09]Fuck this weapon!
[291:21.77]This is Dark Souls again.
[291:24.21]You swing over every... You only use that weapon.
[291:27.91]Only for a fucking boss.
[291:29.15]What a worthless fucking item.
[291:31.03]Jesus Christ.
[291:32.41]Oh my god.
[291:35.15]I mean, that was probably what I did.
[291:40.13]That's probably the same.
[291:41.31]Is that the same clip?
[291:42.15]That could have been.
[291:43.17]If you place that on top of the ghost footage, would it be the same thing?
[292:02.15]I'm just like clicking.
[292:03.75]Oh, this is one more sensor.
[292:20.17]Who ever said that in chat?
[292:22.33]That started that?
[292:24.05]You are fucking hilarious.
[292:26.89]The Mario Tennis Link is legit.
[292:28.81]You mean it's probably a gnome?
[292:30.25]Let me check it.
[292:34.78]I had to do the tutorial.
[292:36.10]I was making it up to not look so bad.
[292:43.22]This really is the Mario Tennis Link.
[292:45.42]How did you get this so quickly?
[292:46.22]That was like a week and a half ago.
[292:47.45]And I didn't like the game, so I stopped playing it.
[292:55.47]Look at that shit.
[292:56.97]What the fuck is this?
[292:58.07]This guy's throwing a wiffle ball across the court.
[293:12.10]Oh my lord.
[293:24.23]That's not even the worst part.
[293:26.07]Here it is.
[293:26.39]I think I have to stop playing.
[293:36.04]I have to stop playing.
[293:37.58]Alright, I'm going.
[293:38.32]I'm getting out of here.
[293:40.40]I gotta go.
[293:40.66]I gotta get out of here.
[293:45.65]Anyways, thanks everybody for watching.
[293:47.57]See you tomorrow.
[293:48.35]Have a great one.
[293:49.17]I gotta get out of here.
[293:50.21]I'm not even kidding.
[293:51.27]I gotta go.
[293:55.08]Take care, everybody.
[293:55.69]See you soon.
[294:29.26]you
