[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]you
[01:04.93]Why, hello there.
[01:06.17]How are you?
[01:10.62]What's happening?
[01:11.74]How have you been?
[01:13.26]It's been a day or two.
[01:19.97]We got some stuff going on today.
[01:21.57]We got a couple things going on.
[01:26.94]First of all, we've got one or two demos to play.
[01:34.12]Second of all,
[01:36.02]We've got four horsemen to hang out with.
[01:41.66]Hey, working out right now.
[01:42.40]Can I get some gym motivation?
[01:43.79]Big dog?
[01:44.47]Yeah.
[01:48.35]What are you doing?
[01:49.19]What set are you on?
[01:49.83]You on back?
[01:50.39]You on buys?
[01:52.58]You on chest?
[01:53.78]Tries?
[01:54.06]What are you on?
[01:54.40]What are you doing today?
[01:56.12]You got to give me a little bit of what you're starting with.
[02:03.07]Dude, you're on chest and tries, let me tell you.
[02:05.15]Alright.
[02:07.51]I need like a soundboard to have electric guitar music.
[02:12.27]Hey, get it.
[02:13.88]Hey, get it.
[02:16.30]You and me.
[02:16.78]Hey, it's you and me.
[02:17.98]You're on rep number two.
[02:19.73]Let's get it.
[02:20.85]Get it, man.
[02:21.99]Do three.
[02:23.05]Alright, that's enough.
[02:23.87]That's enough.
[02:24.33]Put it down.
[02:27.97]Is that two and a half pounds?
[02:30.00]That's it, man.
[02:31.20]Don't do any more than that.
[02:32.20]That's too much.
[02:33.92]My turn.
[02:36.33]Hey.
[02:36.43]Boom.
[02:36.55]Put it at four pounds.
[02:40.03]And tell me to get it!
[02:40.77]Let's go!
[02:41.17]What is this bit?
[02:45.26]I'm giving motivation to the guy I'm at the gym with.
[02:49.53]In his head.
[02:50.07]Ha ha ha.
[02:56.53]Four pounds.
[02:57.45]That's extreme.
[02:58.37]Three reps at four pounds.
[03:03.02]Yeah, well, hey, look.
[03:05.06]I understand that the, like, 65-year-old lady that you drive by that's walking with the two pink weights, that might have been less than that.
[03:17.09]Hey, but you gotta fucking start somewhere.
[03:20.16]Don't listen to the haters.
[03:28.24]That's the grind set.
[03:31.33]Four pounds becomes five.
[03:33.19]Five becomes ten.
[03:35.08]Ten becomes twenty.
[03:37.03]Twenty!
[03:39.05]How much did I do at my peak of physical fitness?
[03:43.28]I'm talking about the tricep pull machine.
[03:46.36]The one where you grab the rope and you stand up straight and you don't do a ton of movement.
[03:52.83]You just kind of put your elbows, do that push down.
[03:55.17]I think I was hitting somewhere around 30 or 40, maybe 50 pounds at one point.
[04:04.14]I don't know if that's good.
[04:04.97]I don't remember.
[04:05.55]I could be wrong.
[04:06.17]It might be more than that.
[04:10.03]I used to love that machine.
[04:11.16]That was like my favorite thing to do.
[04:16.12]When I was doing chest and tricep days, that machine had a big highlight around it.
[04:24.55]Like, I can't wait to go do that.
[04:26.11]It's like my favorite exercise in the world.
[04:32.66]Why are you talking about this like it's a theme park ride?
[04:36.01]Because it was fun!
[04:41.07]The overhead tricep pull using the same machine, that's a good one too.
[04:48.86]Once you get into it, and physical fitness becomes something that you really get into, if you kind of gamify your own body, it's leveling up in real life.
[05:04.02]Like, how many points am I going to put into arms today?
[05:13.28]Dude, I'm level 22.
[05:16.69]You got soft locked at 40 pounds.
[05:23.46]Alright, here's what we're doing today.
[05:25.69]We are doing...
[05:28.41]I got the painkiller demo.
[05:30.09]I just wanted to try it.
[05:32.64]And we're going to wait around.
[05:33.36]We're going to wait until the horsemen are ready.
[05:35.78]And then I believe what's on tap is Lego Party.
[05:39.59]And... We've got two or three other games that are just kind of in the wings.
[05:43.01]Just ready.
[05:44.07]Whatever we're going to do.
[05:48.10]Apparently this is a new... Painkiller's an old game series.
[05:51.84]I remember that.
[05:53.26]I never really played it.
[05:55.75]Is it... Painkiller's like a wave shooting game, right?
[06:00.01]Hey, I just passed law school.
[06:01.38]Thanks to me.
[06:04.06]Uh, you're giving me way too much credit for you doing a bunch of law school work.
[06:09.55]I didn't do anything.
[06:10.31]I wasn't there.
[06:11.93]You did that.
[06:13.39]Hey, get it.
[06:14.09]Hey, let's get it.
[06:16.72]Well, not, not, I'm not, nothing to do with it.
[06:18.60]You get it.
[06:20.44]Alright, let's go.
[06:24.99]You were there.
[06:30.48]Alright, here it is.
[06:31.10]Painkiller.
[06:33.07]We're just going to play for, I don't know, like maybe 30, 40 minutes.
[06:40.28]Wait till everyone's ready.
[06:44.06]Audio good?
[06:45.12]I think we're good.
[06:46.76]This is also part of the next best, if you were curious.
[06:53.61]Beyond the mortal realm, purgatory is stricken by a demon infestation.
[07:00.83]I think this game comes out in a few days, by the way.
[07:07.76]I think.
[07:29.49]Let's get it.
[07:35.18]Sorry, that's the word of the day.
[07:36.89]I know, I'm aware that my streams have a word of the day.
[07:41.01]I apologize.
[07:43.13]Okay.
[07:46.54]Escape the prison.
[07:57.99]There, looks pretty fucking buttery!
[08:04.14]Whoa, you fly!
[08:07.83]Do you just move faster if you hold control?
[08:20.17]That's kind of crazy.
[08:23.63]Oh, I'm not playing online.
[08:26.40]I was like, why is it a bot?
[08:28.52]Wait, is this a co-op shooter?
[08:32.12]So.
[08:33.52]But.
[08:34.38]Okay.
[08:42.03]Punch the button.
[08:55.52]Ow.
[08:55.78]That's going to cause a Peter Griffin like 10 minute moment for me, I think.
[09:02.92]Alright, find a weapon.
[09:07.10]That looks like a pretty good weapon.
[09:08.18]How do I get it?
[09:10.51]Oh.
[09:14.17]Is this a Gaguda game?
[09:17.62]Hold to rotate and use the painkiller.
[09:20.30]Hitting enemies with the painkiller generates that ammo.
[09:24.33]You always have the painkiller at hand under three when you run out of ammo.
[09:28.41]Is this a Gaguda game?
[09:28.93]Fortunately, this one is demonic.
[09:38.30]I don't know why, my brain just goes to this.
[09:46.75]We're going to look really weird in retrospect, aren't we?
[09:54.72]Let's not start this with an alien rant, but... What is this human?
[09:58.99]What is this thing that you're doing?
[10:00.56]Oh, dude, it's called, uh, it's called Painkiller, man.
[10:03.27]What you do is you hold the button.
[10:04.31]Here, sit down, sit down.
[10:05.39]Sit down in the seat.
[10:06.31]This is your, control your vessel.
[10:09.58]But, do I have the, can I, am I smart enough to know how to use your spaceship?
[10:14.31]It's alright, dude, just sit down.
[10:16.59]This person's gonna, this alien's gonna sit down.
[10:18.85]And it's like, you hold the button down.
[10:20.26]Okay, so I hold the button down and they're piloting the vessel like this?
[10:23.10]Yeah, dude, go over and grind up all those people.
[10:26.55]What are you talking about?
[10:27.31]Yeah, bro, go up there and just hold the fucking button down and grind up everybody you see.
[10:33.34]And you get amusement from this.
[10:35.75]Yeah.
[10:45.20]When you take kind of get yourself like out of the mindset of like, oh, playing video games.
[10:49.97]It's kind of fucking crazy.
[10:55.49]Oh shit, here they come!
[10:57.49]Grind these motherfuckers up into dust!
[11:05.99]Ooh.
[11:14.30]Oh, human, this is actually very fun.
[11:18.67]Thank you for showing me this.
[11:20.79]It's so fun, in fact, that I think that we're going to do this to your entire race.
[11:24.57]It's so much fun.
[11:26.67]Wait, what are you talking about, bro?
[11:28.75]I mean, look at how much fun I'm having.
[11:31.18]The ship will arrive shortly.
[11:35.44]Oh my god.
[11:48.38]How do I switch weapons?
[11:50.50]123.
[11:50.86]Look at all the shit on the ground.
[12:02.46]Yeah, how do I change weapons?
[12:04.04]Did I miss how to change weapons?
[12:08.34]It's six or over here.
[12:09.42]I don't know what that is.
[12:12.49]Mouse wheel mouse wheel ain't doing it either.
[12:17.20]How do I switch weapons?
[12:19.42]Q. E. R. A.
[12:23.45]Wheel.
[12:28.31]Tab?
[12:30.87]I have to check the bindings.
[12:32.21]What is this?
[12:35.46]Key bindings.
[12:36.38]Fire.
[12:37.50]Fly.
[12:37.72]Dash.
[12:38.34]Shred.
[12:39.20]Interact.
[12:40.14]Use.
[12:41.42]Swap weapon.
[12:42.81]So what's going on here?
[12:45.21]Okay, weird.
[12:48.47]That don't work.
[12:50.59]Middle mouse.
[12:53.90]I'm scrolling it.
[12:54.68]Maybe I should just change it if it's not going to work.
[12:59.77]Okay.
[13:00.93]Swap.
[13:01.57]Do I even have another weapon?
[13:02.53]Okay.
[13:02.71]1, 2, 3.
[13:03.47]1, 2, 3.
[13:06.62]Yeah.
[13:06.78]1, 2 don't work either.
[13:09.16]Mouse wheel down.
[13:10.34]Yeah.
[13:11.28]What if I make it like J?
[13:14.49]Will it work then?
[13:18.17]Does not work.
[13:18.73]OK, well, whatever.
[13:22.86]I think I found the exit.
[13:28.06]All I have is the grinder.
[13:32.61]I mean, the game looks great.
[13:37.28]You don't have another weapon.
[13:38.54]Didn't I have one?
[13:39.30]I did.
[13:39.74]I shot it like three times.
[13:48.78]Press E again.
[13:52.34]You can tag a tombstone.
[13:54.13]Okay.
[13:54.87]You can tag interactive objects.
[13:57.03]Hold that to do a command.
[14:02.55]Hold B.
[14:03.46]Okay.
[14:04.84]Alright, here's another weapon.
[14:11.50]Let me pick it up.
[14:12.85]Okay.
[14:14.81]Now I have two weapons.
[14:19.61]Okay, now J works.
[14:30.76]Cool.
[14:32.14]Do headshots matter?
[14:32.85]It looks like they do.
[14:39.17]Well, now I want to swap it back to mouse wheel.
[14:47.90]There we go.
[14:53.88]This is not a Gogeta game.
[14:58.65]Hook point.
[15:00.75]You can snap to a hook.
[15:07.92]I like this weapon.
[15:09.37]I think I have magical powers too, don't I?
[15:20.76]Punch.
[15:24.70]This is the game Jimmy played in GTA 5.
[15:34.07]Use your weapon attachment to stun demons.
[15:36.51]Stunned enemies expose weak spots that allow for quick kills.
[15:40.80]Alright, stun.
[15:41.66]Stunning!
[15:42.92]That didn't work.
[15:45.97]Ah, you gotta fill the meter.
[15:49.67]You can grab shards that restore that.
[15:53.84]Alright, cool.
[15:57.49]Oh, get him with the shit stick.
[16:04.76]What did you get at Popeye's?
[16:06.74]Uh, number one.
[16:12.73]I just got a D. Revive a teammate, approach them, and hold F. Oh, I gotta go.
[16:20.50]I'm coming.
[16:27.62]Stunning.
[16:32.01]So much for scouting, huh?
[16:36.80]This game is fun.
[16:38.06]I can say this is fun.
[16:38.78]Arcade shooting kind of game.
[16:42.74]Not really, but I'm feeling charitable.
[16:47.77]Hey, I just found on the level can help you or your command.
[16:49.71]Alright, save your campaign.
[16:50.37]Pick up a health flask.
[16:52.74]And then Q to heal.
[16:54.88]Healing if you need it.
[16:57.10]Oh, okay.
[16:58.59]The game fixed how bad I just wasn't that.
[17:00.63]I thought it was a med pack.
[17:06.10]Okay, let's do it.
[17:09.68]Okay, you can resurrect your deceased ally.
[17:21.86]Let's do it.
[17:23.74]Alright, so we have to have a word of the day today.
[17:30.55]Anytime I say it, you guys have to do the Pee Wee Herman thing.
[17:33.82]Where you scream because I said it.
[17:36.36]What do you think that is today?
[17:37.22]Is it kind of let's get it?
[17:38.67]That sounded pretty much like it, right?
[17:45.01]Beautiful.
[17:47.50]Beautiful.
[17:55.90]Alright, let's go.
[18:07.71]That doesn't count.
[18:14.28]Get up top.
[18:17.24]Good.
[18:17.36]Good.
[18:23.65]Let's take out the grinder.
[18:33.17]But I'm barely killing stuff.
[18:37.08]So we're good.
[18:49.08]I'm getting points for doing cool things.
[18:55.17]Alright.
[18:55.37]Stunning!
[19:14.69]ULTRAKILL!
[19:16.57]Brazing kill!
[19:18.29]Murderous!
[19:19.97]Ultra murderous!
[19:22.49]Destructive!
[19:26.10]Killed!
[19:36.95]Give her instinct!
[19:43.53]Ultra!
[19:44.79]Ultra!
[19:45.89]Ultra!
[19:50.80]Whoa!
[19:51.14]Okay, so we did it.
[19:58.55]This game's pretty good.
[20:05.96]It's pretty buttery.
[20:11.32]Okay.
[20:12.13]Alright, that's it.
[20:19.44]Cool.
[20:21.76]I could see that be fun with friends.
[20:28.23]So now you do without tutorial.
[20:31.40]Go to the armory.
[20:34.14]Who is talking?
[20:37.04]I figured as much.
[20:39.70]A treacherous angel who has done much to corrupt mankind.
[20:44.97]He also cheats at poker.
[20:49.20]A zazzle now resides in the tomb.
[20:52.69]Accruing a loyal following of demons from hell.
[20:57.32]Okay.
[20:58.14]Upgrade weapons.
[21:04.83]Stake gun.
[21:07.45]Electro driver.
[21:10.19]I actually like this one.
[21:14.70]How do I upgrade this one?
[21:17.88]Is this skill 3?
[21:21.28]That's actually pretty cool.
[21:22.06]Okay.
[21:23.56]What is this?
[21:24.52]Shooting stars.
[21:26.43]Stars and stripes!
[21:29.06]Starting star.
[21:31.43]Shield slam.
[21:34.53]Something's wrong with you today.
[21:36.11]I'm sorry.
[21:40.56]This one's good.
[21:45.49]They bounce around.
[21:48.81]Chain lightning.
[21:53.04]Chain lightning.
[21:56.26]Wait, it has to be equipped.
[21:58.51]What about the other one?
[22:06.26]That's good.
[22:12.29]Blaster grenade.
[22:13.49]I like it.
[22:16.72]Oh, I have to complete the tutorial first.
[22:20.06]How about the devil's screwdriver?
[22:24.51]It's the name of a drink at a themed bar.
[22:31.92]Okay, so it's like a dot.
[22:41.69]Cool.
[22:41.81]Okay.
[22:42.73]The tarot table.
[22:44.97]The last time I did a tarot reading, it was like, you're fucked.
[22:47.69]You're fucked.
[22:48.37]Your life sucks.
[22:49.38]Your life is fucked.
[22:50.56]That's like what it was.
[22:52.92]And I was like, I don't know if I'm going to do this again.
[23:02.60]Tarot cards increase your advantage over your opponents.
[23:04.71]They burn out after a raid.
[23:06.65]Okay.
[23:09.40]$3,000!
[23:18.72]Start the lottery.
[23:28.54]That's good.
[23:30.12]That's good.
[23:31.72]Why such much money?
[23:38.65]I can do another one.
[23:40.27]Do it again.
[23:44.27]Your weapon deals 30% more damage.
[23:47.66]Yep.
[23:51.06]This is cool.
[23:54.04]Got my tarot cards on.
[23:57.67]Looks good.
[24:00.45]I think am I just ready to do another one?
[24:02.61]Set up a game.
[24:08.08]Okay.
[24:08.20]Raids.
[24:13.03]I think there's only one I can do.
[24:16.57]Daydream.
[24:17.29]200% gold.
[24:19.45]You can do Insomnia or Nightmare.
[24:21.54]What's the easy one?
[24:23.00]Slumber.
[24:23.68]No, we'll do Daydream.
[24:24.46]That's fine.
[24:29.54]Shouldn't you play this with the horseman?
[24:38.24]Well, this is just a demo.
[24:40.18]So I imagine it's probably going to be over in.
[24:43.61]Let's call it.
[24:45.27]10-20 minutes.
[24:58.80]I'm just chilling until we're ready to play.
[25:01.36]So let's check.
[25:01.78]Let's check out my new stuff.
[25:03.69]I like this game.
[25:13.84]Are you blonde or brunette?
[25:15.72]Something in between that.
[25:16.76]I got brown blonde hair.
[25:19.67]I don't know.
[25:29.43]Why are you asking that?
[25:34.26]I don't like that question.
[25:45.83]Money?
[25:46.83]Ooh, okay.
[25:51.60]Did I tell... Oh, baby, you stand on that.
[25:54.04]Somebody step on that.
[25:58.74]Step on the plate!
[25:59.72]I wanna fly!
[26:02.73]Stop fighting and step on the plate!
[26:05.96]I command it!
[26:08.23]Step on the plate!
[26:12.42]What are you...
[26:12.94]He jumped over to spite me!
[26:28.07]Is there a double jump?
[26:35.06]Money.
[26:37.37]Dictator.
[26:39.43]It told me to command my friends.
[26:41.65]That's what it said.
[26:42.32]It said, your friends can be commanded to do whatever you tell them to do.
[26:50.21]Does it go that way?
[26:53.96]The demon war.
[26:58.08]Somebody does something cool.
[27:23.89]You know what?
[27:24.51]Let's go.
[27:28.72]I think this is my favorite weapon.
[27:30.80]I like the weed whacker.
[27:33.75]It's great.
[27:44.02]I always love in video games like this when the characters very clearly, when the voices were recorded.
[27:50.95]If this was happening, it wouldn't be, well, that wasn't so hard.
[27:55.80]What do you know about that?
[27:56.90]Yeah, the demon war was great.
[27:58.56]You'd be like, the demon war was crazy.
[28:02.50]Last time this happened, we got invaded by 10,000 people.
[28:05.41]Hold on, man.
[28:06.45]You know who did that correctly?
[28:07.95]Was the new Spider-Man game.
[28:10.87]The new Spider-Man game had that locked down.
[28:22.99]Where if you were swinging, Peter Parker or Miles Morales, they would change the way that they were talking to be like, that's kind of crazy.
[28:31.48]They did it for almost every line.
[28:32.56]You got to give credit for that.
[28:35.55]Recording every piece of dialog, one strained and the other not strained is, that's pretty cool.
[28:46.80]Red Dead Redemption did it as well.
[28:47.94]Yeah, some games have done it and it's cool.
[28:50.97]Contextual voice lines.
[29:04.67]Zap him!
[29:18.18]Wanna shoot him through the... Oh shit.
[29:22.49]Oh!
[29:22.67]I'm out of energy.
[29:28.38]Dude, I forgot to slide.
[29:30.16]I forgot I could slide.
[29:32.71]What the fuck is that?
[29:43.65]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[29:55.95]I'm dead.
[29:57.66]Where are my teammates?
[30:06.65]That was funny looking.
[30:15.15]OK, we're good.
[30:25.27]Anything else to get?
[30:31.35]Where are my teammates?
[30:38.46]Who else has GERD that's out of control and you don't know why?
[30:41.04]I'm sorry to hear that.
[30:44.93]That's gastroesophageal reflex disease.
[30:47.39]No, that's not fun.
[30:55.59]Alright, you go.
[30:56.49]You go over there.
[30:57.45]Let's see what the bot decides to do.
[31:05.02]Alright, I'm going that way.
[31:18.32]I can pick the barrels up.
[31:19.14]That's cool.
[31:22.26]Wait, there's money over there.
[31:30.28]Ooh!
[31:34.47]What'd I do?
[31:36.15]I activated something.
[31:41.62]Are we going?
[31:42.20]Where are we going?
[31:44.13]It's this way.
[31:49.98]Incoming horde!
[32:08.03]It's going to be an obstacle.
[32:09.01]What happened?
[32:24.82]We alright?
[32:31.41]The meat grinder.
[32:32.39]Yeah, it really kind of is.
[32:35.05]Hey, somebody step on this.
[32:38.27]What did that do?
[32:46.67]Dude, secret!
[32:50.94]How do I?
[32:51.48]Ooh, alright.
[32:52.42]Get in there.
[32:57.76]What's in here?
[33:00.63]Massive amount of cash.
[33:03.16]Sounds good.
[33:12.37]Alright, didn't we come from this way?
[33:14.67]Wait, there's something over there.
[33:20.08]Whatever.
[33:21.40]Crazy.
[33:31.40]I like this weapon.
[33:32.28]This grenade launcher is fun.
[33:42.63]Do we all have to stand here?
[33:43.55]Yep.
[33:48.69]How come you're not playing fart simulator for once?
[33:53.82]Well, I'm playing a demo, so this game's not even out yet.
[33:58.74]Can I make that?
[33:59.76]Somebody else get up there.
[34:07.21]Hey, bot!
[34:08.77]Go get that.
[34:18.86]I don't get it.
[34:31.94]I don't know.
[34:32.52]I don't know.
[34:34.99]When the game...
[34:36.05]They're wiping the servers anyways.
[34:39.51]Fine.
[34:41.12]It's a demo.
[34:46.48]Desecrator.
[35:03.01]Oops.
[35:19.51]Movement's pretty good.
[35:31.98]Come on, stun him!
[35:32.36]Who's left?
[35:36.52]I got a D, I just had an A.
[36:07.46]I got the Soul Cage.
[36:13.94]I got the- hey, Ster!
[36:15.26]I got the Soul Cage!
[36:18.31]Oh, sweet, Jerma!
[36:20.11]Vinny!
[36:21.31]Vinny, where are you?
[36:23.79]Uh, I'm over here, Jerm.
[36:26.18]I'm gonna put it down here.
[36:26.78]Put it down?
[36:29.74]Ho!
[36:29.82]Ho!
[36:30.84]I need defense up here!
[36:36.26]Poke!
[36:37.40]Oh, he might be AFK.
[36:43.11]Oh, I'm back!
[36:43.47]I'm back!
[36:44.54]What's up, dude?
[36:45.56]I think I fucked it up.
[36:46.62]Where do we put the soul cage thing?
[36:50.08]Jerm, I think we have to bring it over here.
[36:52.33]Thank you, Brian Griffin.
[36:53.47]Apparently, you're in the call, too.
[36:55.13]No, don't mention it.
[36:58.32]Oh, I gotta put it over there.
[36:59.76]Vinny, if I throw to you, can you take it?
[37:09.74]Biden, what do you think you're doing?
[37:27.79]Oh, shut up, man.
[37:28.77]I'm trying to get...
[37:29.67]I'm clearing all the monsters up here.
[37:32.21]Guys, I'm down here, and it's...
[37:34.40]Honestly, it's brutal down here.
[37:36.52]Trump, come on.
[37:37.18]We have to do it.
[37:38.40]Oh, man, shut up.
[37:42.95]That was like everybody's fucking feed for like three years.
[37:50.98]Oh, there's another one.
[37:51.60]I can do it again, hold on.
[38:02.33]I have to do this five times.
[38:11.34]Come on, generate them!
[38:14.63]Oh my god!
[38:25.24]Can somebody else pick this up?
[38:28.10]Like you, Vinny?
[38:37.22]Don't even fucking heal me!
[38:49.25]Two more.
[38:59.27]Fucking Diablo is down here!
[39:04.49]Uh, Diablo, I'm sorry, but, excuse me.
[39:15.91]You haven't had a good game in ten years.
[39:21.08]Stop saying that, Trump.
[39:24.95]I want some ice cream, man.
[39:27.57]Me, Joe Biden.
[39:40.53]Do you think there were more or less than 10,000 of those videos made?
[39:58.56]There we go.
[40:02.47]I got a D. Far more than you think.
[40:18.70]What's that?
[40:27.08]Patrick, I won't go to over here.
[40:29.66]If you could follow me here, Patrick.
[40:32.32]Okay, SpongeBob.
[40:33.27]I'll follow you over there.
[40:34.21]I need ammo.
[40:35.71]Patrick, don't say you need ammo.
[40:37.95]I don't have any ammo.
[40:41.15]Don't do that.
[40:48.48]Patrick, I don't have that gun that you use.
[40:54.53]I always love when they do that.
[41:10.03]When the voice says instead of don't it says don't.
[41:13.14]I don't.
[41:15.16]I also love a lot of the AI stuff loves to say how many views a certain thing gets.
[41:20.72]All of those AI ads that you'll see pop up from time to time.
[41:24.43]It's crazy to me that this recipe has 1,444,000 views on YouTube.
[41:29.97]Why are you giving me an exact number?
[41:33.48]Can you believe it?
[41:34.42]This one recipe has 443,000 views.
[41:38.45]Okay, why can't you see 150?
[41:39.97]I don't get it.
[42:05.29]I gotta go, let's get in there.
[42:11.52]Why do you have the dad algorithm?
[42:23.07]Dangerous jump.
[42:32.57]Oh, that's a big one!
[42:36.91]I'm just warming up for when we play together with everybody.
[43:00.75]Keep moving.
[43:04.25]Keep going.
[43:16.60]They should add a Bubsy skin to this game.
[43:34.82]Oh, fuck.
[43:35.02]I need a heal.
[43:36.84]Help!
[43:42.02]Yeah, I know the bots haven't been downed.
[43:44.38]The bots have played the game before.
[43:46.12]So, you know, it's programmed into their brain to know where to go.
[43:49.73]The game has an interface that's programmed.
[43:53.07]The bots know the map.
[43:55.84]How would they not?
[43:59.40]Oh, shit.
[44:16.17]Ancient soul got it.
[44:28.09]Who you playing with right now?
[44:30.62]You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
[44:34.32]Hey Joe.
[44:35.89]I know how much you enjoy blowing things up, but you cannot destroy the soul beacon this way.
[44:43.21]That's disappointing.
[44:46.97]There are two stages to it.
[44:48.80]First, you must destroy the will of souls.
[44:51.42]I need to heal for that.
[44:54.00]You'll need to seek out the Ark within Solomon's Temple.
[44:56.93]Oh boy.
[45:04.86]Stay your course and you reach the temple.
[45:05.72]That move is great.
[45:06.48]Whoever has that is awesome.
[45:10.17]Money.
[45:23.21]And eating cream of wheat right now.
[45:24.91]I'm so glad that you are.
[45:26.57]Hey, that low sugar cream of wheat.
[45:38.37]We destroy this.
[45:46.72]Somebody said that I'm eating liquid bread.
[45:50.43]And that oatmeal is way better.
[45:51.73]And I agree, oatmeal is good.
[45:54.09]But, whatever.
[45:54.85]There we go, extra life.
[46:11.33]Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[46:14.23]Yeah, I should have.
[46:21.10]What about cream of the crop?
[46:25.36]Yeah.
[46:27.05]I can't do that right now.
[46:28.69]I can do an OK macho man.
[46:30.69]I think over the years.
[46:32.41]But if you pull out a macho man.
[46:34.82]Your throat hurts for the rest of the day.
[46:37.78]Especially if you go all in.
[46:48.75]Come on.
[46:51.96]Alright, everything loaded up?
[46:59.85]That looks like a boss.
[47:02.91]We good?
[47:07.62]Oh, we're getting the music.
[47:15.81]Oh shit.
[47:17.55]Are we fighting that thing?
[47:21.36]Alright, fill it up with souls.
[47:32.92]Where's the moment to put this?
[47:38.45]Fill the vessel with souls.
[47:39.67]Isn't that the... Is that right there?
[47:41.01]Oh, we can't do it.
[48:01.00]Snipers.
[48:20.80]Oh, it's down there.
[48:21.86]OK.
[48:25.77]I'm getting stabbed.
[48:33.48]What is blowing up on me?
[48:36.47]Oh shit.
[48:48.49]Hey!
[48:56.42]That's not far enough.
[49:08.77]It didn't go in?
[49:11.15]It didn't go in.
[49:13.76]Oh, that's bad.
[49:14.44]I need another one.
[49:38.15]Get up there.
[49:39.61]Get up here.
[49:49.52]What am I doing?
[49:50.60]Do they have to drop this?
[49:53.87]Oh, there's only one way to go in.
[50:05.36]Need more souls.
[50:08.05]Where's my team?
[50:17.64]I have no ammo.
[50:27.63]Alright, two more.
[50:33.10]Ow.
[50:33.18]This game is fucking crazy.
[50:35.28]Come on, hurry up.
[50:53.87]Okay, got him.
[51:10.65]One more.
[51:12.87]They're spawning everywhere.
[51:16.85]Last vessel's right there.
[51:17.76]Alright.
[51:18.60]See if I can shock this person.
[51:22.00]No, just get it.
[51:22.74]Just get it.

[52:03.54]And I go, wait a minute.
[52:05.20]Oh, that's right.
[52:05.72]I'm 40.

[52:10.13]Oh.
[52:11.53]But I still missed that assignment.
[52:12.73]Are they going to be mad 20 years later?

[53:03.27]I was 2020 years ago.
[53:06.66]I'm talking about this is like a college assignment.
[53:09.74]More than I was, but basically it's 121 22 years ago.

[53:21.41]These things.
[53:23.71]Have to get out of here, OK?
[53:25.75]Where are they?
[53:31.18]This thing's out of energy.
