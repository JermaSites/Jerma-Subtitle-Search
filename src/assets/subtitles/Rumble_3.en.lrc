[ve:60.16.100]

[00:09.78]It's the end of a year and the beginning of a new adventure.
[00:14.07]Welcome, everyone, to Terma Rumble 3.
[00:17.93]Excitement, awe, and inspiring motions will get you on your feet tonight, I can promise you that.
[00:24.82]But before we get started, please join me in a moment of silence to remember all those wrestlers who we lost this past year.
[00:46.14]you
[01:36.11]And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise and welcome Grandpa to sing our national anthem.
[01:46.13]I'll say, can you see?
[01:48.53]By a drop of mouth smokey, my poor meatball, I'm bursting in air, I'm bursting in air.
[01:58.46]Grandpa!
[01:58.86]Grandpa!
[01:59.26]Turn on my mic!
[02:00.24]Turn my mic on!
[02:01.46]Grandpa!
[02:02.42]Oh, no, that's Demon Lord Zaraxos, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04.92]I can't even... He's got a chocolate...
[02:07.63]Whoa!
[02:08.35]He just did... just fire underneath that ring.
[02:12.35]Okay, um... Hey, everybody, welcome to Jerma Rumble 3.
[02:16.71]I'm Jerma.
[02:17.93]While I try to compose myself after what just happened, Sonic the Hedgehog is now coming down to the ring.
[02:23.30]He's supposed to come in 16th.
[02:25.00]What the fuck is going on?
[02:27.32]I'm gonna have to do some jumbling around of the schedule here and see who's coming in next.
[02:29.92]But anyways, uh, he visibly drunk and spitting at people in the audience is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[02:35.28]Look, we get it.
[02:36.18]We know Sonic Boom wasn't a good success.
[02:39.08]We know that Jermania 2014, you lost.
[02:41.54]But that is no excuse for this type of behavior.
[02:43.86]Get your act together.
[02:45.40]Please ring that bell.
[02:46.86]Let's start Jerma Rumble 3.
[02:48.34]My god.
[02:51.38]No, he's, uh...
[02:54.39]He's dead.
[02:54.81]Uh, that's the second person Zaraxos has killed in two minutes.
[02:59.76]And our- Akira, the button- the- we started, guys.
[03:02.88]We have started two or three minutes ago, so that means another contestant has to come down to the arena.
[03:07.72]And we'll get this guy introduced as quickly as possible.
[03:09.90]This is Tertimus the Adolescent Warrior.
[03:12.51]And he's got a task ahead of him.
[03:14.75]If he's going to be number three, that's gonna die, and he's gonna show off for the cameras a little bit here.
[03:19.51]If he is number three to die in a row by Demon Lord Zaraxos,
[03:23.37]I really don't know what to say.
[03:24.41]I'm not entirely sure how we're going to continue the rumble, but Tertimus, if Master Splintode has taught you anything at all, please use it immediately, because it would be bad if... Demon Lord Zaraxos just eliminated himself.
[03:40.69]Why?
[03:40.93]What?
[03:42.07]What?
[03:44.83]I have no idea why that just happened.
[03:46.89]But regardless, we have to send another person in prematurely.
[03:49.87]So whoever is next on the list, send them on out here.
[03:52.53]And it's going to be... Ladies and gentlemen, it's a good one.
[03:55.65]It's the 1997 Boston Celtics champion...
[03:59.49]Frank Pizza running down here with his patented, I have a dump in my pants run.
[04:04.59]Here he comes and let's get started.
[04:07.49]Welcome to actual wrestlers in the ring now.
[04:11.47]We're going to actually talk about technical wrestling rather than people just instantly dying when they come into the ring.
[04:17.89]Turtibus, the teenage adolescent mutant warrior or whatever, what did I call him?
[04:22.20]Something like that.
[04:22.92]And Frank Pizza of the Boston Celtics wearing his 1997 authentic championship jersey.
[04:29.42]Turtimus was looking for a early elimination there, but cannot even get him over the first turnbuckle.
[04:34.34]Well, Frank Pizze is now hanging on the nice reverse elbow and a flying shoulder tackle onto Turtimus for his troubles.
[04:40.08]But Frank Pizze gets his leg caught, gets spun around on his back.
[04:43.57]And here comes another contestant.
[04:45.65]If you forget how this works, every minute or so another competitor is going to come down, and here comes a familiar face indeed.
[04:52.57]You had to have thought that after Captain Crunch's victory at Jermania 2014, we'd see more serial characters, and here's Count Chocula!
[05:01.00]coming down to the Jerma Arena for the first time ever.
[05:04.18]And unfortunately, his cereal, like, doesn't even exist anymore.
[05:09.37]You can only get Count Chocula on Halloween.
[05:12.35]That's how much this guy sucks.
[05:14.05]But he's in the Jerma Rumble for the first time ever.
[05:17.01]Let's see if he's got any tricks up his sleeve.
[05:18.78]Besides, of course...
[05:20.55]turning your milk into chocolate milk.
[05:22.57]And it's not even really chocolate milk.
[05:24.23]It's like a weird, inside-of-a-dog's-ass chocolate milk.
[05:27.77]It tastes like, it's just like sugar and... It's alright.
[05:30.77]Look, I'm not gonna blast Count Chocula, because I used to eat it every other day when I was a kid.
[05:36.89]I'd eat Captain Crunch, I'd eat Count Chocula, I'd eat, like, Boo Berry, all these old cereals.
[05:42.40]I ate them all when I was younger, so I can't be biased against any of them.
[05:45.64]Well, we got another contestant coming in right now.
[05:49.40]Confidently walking down to the arena is everybody's favorite shit character.
[05:54.23]It is none other than Gabe, the glue man Dick Rossi!
[05:58.95]Fireworks.
[05:59.41]I don't know why he bought fireworks.
[06:01.03]He spent like 60 bucks for no reason, because nobody cares.
[06:03.70]Nobody cares about you, Glue Man.
[06:04.94]Just get in here and win for fucking once in your life.
[06:08.10]Four people in the arena, now we get Glue Man, Captain Crunch.
[06:11.18]No, I almost just said Captain Crunch.
[06:12.46]That's Count Chocula.
[06:13.24]Get your cereals right.
[06:14.42]That's Count Chocula, Glue Man, Frank Pizza, and Turtibust Teenage Warrior.
[06:18.75]No eliminations whatsoever.
[06:20.87]Not yet, at least.
[06:23.01]And pay attention to the left side of your screen right now.
[06:25.57]Gabe DaGlueManDeGrossi and Frank Pizza, former teammates on the Celtics, are fighting right now for some reason.
[06:30.61]Turtimus is gone!
[06:31.87]Turtimus has just been eliminated from the competition by Count Chocula and GlueMan now!
[06:36.85]GlueMan looks like he just got in.
[06:38.43]This would be a terribly sad story if Frank Pizza and Count Chocula try to help.
[06:42.39]He doesn't really... Count Chocula didn't do anything there, let's be honest.
[06:45.28]Are they actually gonna try to double team GlueMan out of here?
[06:47.80]Another person coming down to the arena right now.
[06:49.30]Who's it gonna be?
[06:49.74]Wow, they're tag teaming GlueMan!
[06:52.48]That's Dick Dastardly Richard from the Rat Movie.
[06:55.82]One of the most notorious gem thieves and artifact stealers this side of the Mississippi, folks.
[07:01.41]This is a dangerous man.
[07:03.47]Keep your eye on him for the remainder of the rumble, because frankly, he is terrifying.
[07:09.29]And here he comes.
[07:10.85]Surprisingly a lot bigger than I thought he was going to be.
[07:13.61]I thought he was only gonna be like 5'5".
[07:16.05]He's, uh, how big is Count Chocula?
[07:18.41]Isn't Count Chocula like three feet tall?
[07:20.76]Well, no, Glue Man's like six something, I think, right?
[07:23.14]I have no idea.
[07:24.02]All I know is that Frank Pizza just gave Glue Man three or four punches, and Glue Man accidentally just slobber knocked Count Chocula in the face.
[07:32.60]He was going for Frank Pizza, but he ended up getting... Oh, then Frank Pizza now gets a chin smash.
[07:37.77]Into a hip toss, and then into a flipping heel kick onto Frank Pizzas.
[07:41.69]Count Chocula is doing some work here.
[07:44.61]Count Chocula and Glue Man doing their respective work.
[07:47.43]Frank Pizza looks like he could be on the verge here of getting eliminated.
[07:50.27]Soak his dick, nationally Richard.
[07:51.33]No, gets the punch.
[07:52.52]Is Captain Cork Corkula.
[07:54.04]Corkula, I said his name wrong.
[07:55.96]Frank Pizza is now eliminated with a drop kick to his face over the ropes.
[07:59.70]And we've got another contestant coming down to the arena.
[08:02.46]It's the Candyman from Lethal League.
[08:05.68]If you've never played Lethal League, in my opinion, it is one of the best indie games of 2014.
[08:11.97]I suggest you check it out.
[08:13.05]He is represented here for the first time ever.
[08:14.77]Welcome Candyman!
[08:16.53]Without his cane that he typically uses.
[08:19.35]And immediately goes for Dick Dastardly Richard, who throws him over the ropes.
[08:22.12]Dick, could he immediately get eliminated for his first appearance in the Jerma arena?
[08:26.00]No.
[08:26.26]Dick Dastardly Richard...
[08:28.10]with a very rare sign of empathy and sympathy there, letting him get up.
[08:32.82]You don't technically see that ever by Dick, and he could really suffer because of that.
[08:36.81]He just gave him a little bit of sympathy.
[08:38.07]You don't give that kind of sympathy to the Candyman.
[08:39.85]Is Dick Dastardly Richard going out?
[08:41.21]Candyman, Count Chocula, how many fucking times am I going to mispronounce Count Chocula's name?
[08:45.97]And just barely, just barely,
[08:48.39]Barely he gets up.
[08:49.85]Dick Dastardly Richard survives another day, but is he going to?
[08:53.31]Right after surviving that, he's going to go, well, we've got another contestant coming in right now, and Dick Dastardly Richard, I can't, I'm going to fucking change that name.
[09:00.69]And here comes a giant rat!
[09:02.13]That's a giant rat!
[09:03.51]Rolling his way down here.
[09:04.59]Look at him go.
[09:05.55]I've never seen such a huge rat in my entire life.
[09:07.92]He definitely prays at night.
[09:09.36]He definitely stalks at night.
[09:10.84]You can tell just by the way he looks.
[09:12.64]And he's in the arena right now as Glue Man is about to get... He's going right for it.
[09:16.24]What a bulldog by the giant rat.
[09:18.70]And he is me means business.
[09:20.56]You got to figure he's definitely a top seed, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:23.38]If I were to say so myself, the giant rat is now in along with Dick Dastardly Richard, which makes it... No, he's gone.
[09:30.71]Dick Richard is gone.
[09:32.03]He has been eliminated.
[09:32.97]Well, the Giant Rat and Count Chocula are trying to push Glue Man out.
[09:36.49]Are they going to block?
[09:37.67]Glue Man has been eliminated.
[09:39.51]Glue Man is out of the competition per use of the Giant Rat and Count Chocula.
[09:44.99]What a terrible thing to see.
[09:47.31]And we've got another person coming out almost immediately already.
[09:51.14]It's crazy to me how fast people come out in this game.
[09:53.78]Has it really been like 30 to 60 seconds?
[09:55.76]I feel like somebody just came in.
[09:57.96]But whatever, it's alright, because it's Earthworm Jim, showing off his dance moves.
[10:01.80]He's ready, he's a veteran of the Jerma Rumbles, and he's here to prove himself.
[10:05.18]He's here to dance, he's here to point, and he's here to win.
[10:08.68]Welcome Earthworm Jim to the Rumble.
[10:10.94]As we've got Count Chocula patiently awaiting his arrival, while the Giant Rat and Candyman are fighting in their own right.
[10:16.34]And Earthworm Jim, right when he gets in, does a headbutt to Count Chocula's stomach.
[10:20.70]Would that even hurt?
[10:22.13]Isn't Earthworm Jim a worm?
[10:24.05]Is there any bones?
[10:24.81]I don't think- worms don't even have any bones, do they?
[10:27.49]So I don't know why that would just kind of feel like squishy goo pushing up against your stomach.
[10:31.57]Anyways, we've got Count Chocula already.
[10:33.41]Count Chocula just eliminated Earthworm Jim with a clothesline over the top ropes.
[10:37.71]Immediately when he gets in.
[10:38.97]Oh, I had high hopes for you, Earthworm Jim.
[10:41.84]Every time you get screwed.
[10:43.18]And Candyman, speaking of people getting screwed, Candyman now looks like he can... No, he's going to stay in.
[10:47.68]He is going to get rid of that double team while we have another person coming in.
[10:50.30]And Count Chocula...
[10:51.90]Almost throws over the giant rat, which is surprising, because he is a top seed.
[10:55.78]Count Chocula lining up the big boot!
[10:57.88]And he's gone!
[10:59.40]And here comes the mime!
[11:01.58]You know, every Jerma Rumble we, uh, there's like a thing where he's the shit character.
[11:07.62]Like, you know how there's always the worst character that's made?
[11:10.92]This is the one.
[11:12.50]But here he comes.
[11:13.32]He jumps over the top ropes.
[11:14.30]There are only three people in the ring at the moment.
[11:16.86]You got Count Chocula, Candyman, and now the mime.
[11:19.80]What's that?
[11:21.91]Are you serious?
[11:23.77]Okay, guys, I'm getting word right now.
[11:25.39]We're gonna be joined at ringside right now by Demon Lord Xaraxos at the commentary table.
[11:31.83]Okay, I don't know.
[11:32.77]Okay.
[11:32.95]We're gonna have to get another seat over here so we can move a couple things while the action's still going on.
[11:39.00]I want to be able to still cast the game, but ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Demon Lord Xaraxos.
[11:44.96]Once you have a seat, we pulled a chair up here for you.
[11:46.98]Please tell us what's on your mind, I guess.
[11:50.53]Man, I was fuckin' bored back there.
[11:53.10]Uh, alright, I don't want to cut you off, but we do have another entrant to come in, Demon Lord.
[11:57.24]It is a 90s icon!
[11:59.14]You know him as the Slim Jim guy!
[12:01.06]Snap into a Slim Jim, oh yeah, baby!
[12:03.79]Here he is!
[12:04.81]Making his first ever appearance!
[12:05.89]The Slim Jim guy is in this?
[12:08.41]Yeah.
[12:08.93]Ugh, I hate this guy!
[12:10.99]What the fuck he do- I've had a feud with this guy for the last, like, 2,000 years.
[12:15.62]You've had a feud with the Slim Jim guy for two... That doesn't make any... You know, I'm gonna move on.
[12:20.24]So, we have Slim Jim guy coming in.
[12:22.05]You really threw me off there, dude.
[12:23.39]We have Slim Jim guy coming in.
[12:24.81]We have the Mime, Count Chocula, and Candyman now, all fighting for dominance in Jerma Rumble 3.
[12:31.15]Welcome, Slim Jim guy.
[12:32.75]And I guess while I have you here, Zaraxas, I do have a couple of questions for you.
[12:36.04]Sure, yeah.
[12:36.48]I'll get to those in a minute, but I do want to focus on what's going on in the ring.
[12:39.06]We've got Slim Jim now on the ropes, and a backhanded slap...
[12:43.26]to Candyman, who is calling for time out right now for some reason.
[12:46.88]People tend to do that.
[12:48.26]Why do people call for time out in the middle of a Royal Rumble?
[12:50.92]You're not going to get it.
[12:51.98]There is no time out.
[12:52.68]What do you think?
[12:53.06]There's a referee here.
[12:53.99]And there goes Candyman.
[12:54.75]No, he just barely.
[12:56.09]Count Chocula almost eliminates him while we have another contestant coming out.
[12:59.97]This guy does not need an introduction.
[13:02.61]He's the most miserable person on Earth.
[13:04.51]Miserable, Mikey.
[13:05.91]And he's all the way from the Quizney Channel.
[13:07.92]The most miserable place on Earth.
[13:10.12]And here he is to show that he's ready to take on everybody in the Jerma Arena.
[13:14.80]He's huge, by the way.
[13:16.38]He's like another giant rat.
[13:18.21]Anyways, now we're getting a little crowded here as he goes for Count Chocula with a couple of swift elbows to his face.
[13:24.59]Nearly takes his skull off, his huge skull, mind you.
[13:27.99]And now that we have sort of a second here where I can ask you, Xeraxos, I have one question, just one simple question.
[13:33.05]Yeah?
[13:33.77]What the hell was going on in the beginning there?
[13:35.99]Why did you eliminate yourself?
[13:37.57]What are you doing?
[13:38.45]You honestly think I belong here?
[13:40.81]It just wasn't fair.
[13:42.23]You're gonna put like Candyman and Count Chocula versus me?
[13:45.12]I'm the lord of all hells.
[13:47.52]None of these little dipshits can do anything against me.
[13:49.78]Why would I be in it?
[13:50.82]God, I fucking hate the Slim Jim guy.
[13:53.28]You need to calm down.
[13:54.48]Okay, you're seriously stressing me out.
[13:56.10]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[13:56.88]So, we got another entrance to do, guys.
[13:58.30]Another buzzer.
[13:59.04]That means number 12 is gonna be coming in.
[14:01.20]And it's, you know him, you'll love him.
[14:03.74]The Egg is coming down for the fourth time.
[14:07.86]You know, I am actually... I hate to say this, but I actually am pleasantly surprised to see the Egg.
[14:12.76]I thought he was gonna die or something.
[14:14.10]I thought he would be one of the people in the beginning that was dead.
[14:16.32]But no, he ends up being here, and hopefully he goes far, because he always loses.
[14:21.14]So welcome, Egg, to the Jerma Rumble, and we've got a lot of stuff going on.
[14:23.76]Candyman now is on the ropes.
[14:25.86]He may, in fact, no, not gonna get eliminated by miserable Mikey.
[14:28.77]I can't get over the fact that the Slim Jim guy is in this.
[14:31.97]Will you stop?
[14:32.31]He's pissing me off.
[14:33.99]You need to stop interrupting me, okay?
[14:35.75]You're really derailing this whole thing.
[14:37.03]I'm going back in.
[14:37.63]Fuck this guy.
[14:38.09]No, no, no, no, no.
[14:38.81]You can't do that.
[14:39.49]Fucking Slim Jim guy.
[14:40.23]Zaraxos, no!
[14:41.53]Zaraxos!
[14:42.83]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[14:43.79]Don't do it!
[14:44.75]Don't do it!
[14:46.27]No, we gotta get... Alright, get security!
[14:48.42]Get security!
[14:49.24]Somebody call the fire department!
[14:50.76]Call security!
[14:51.74]No, what did the mime have to do with this?
[14:53.82]I'm not gonna have this asshole ruin the whole... There's another person dead!
[14:57.54]Zaraxos is killing everybody in the ring!
[14:59.24]Candyman, no!
[15:00.54]Oh, he's going down!
[15:01.48]We need some help!
[15:02.75]The ex... What the...
[15:03.47]Fuck egg don't know how to talk you up.
[15:05.93]Alright.
[15:06.13]We need to get with the army or something How do you deal with a demon lord?
[15:09.19]I have no idea but somebody has to get down there Somebody has to stop this the egg and Mickey Mouse are really started to plotting who's gonna take up You're not gonna be able to take him on.
[15:19.13]Are you crazy?
[15:20.33]I don't know what to do We're gonna have to cancel the whole event guys.
[15:22.73]I'm really sorry about this, but wait a minute Who is that?
[15:26.84]Is that who I think it is?
[15:28.52]That's Mr. Sneak Man!
[15:29.84]Hey, it's me, Mr. Sneak Man.
[15:31.20]Today I'm gonna... Oh, no!
[15:33.98]No!
[15:35.24]He came and he was trying to rescue this event, and he got stopped by Demon Lord Zaraxos.
[15:40.07]This is just ridiculous, guys.
[15:41.85]And now Demon Lord can do whatever he wants now.
[15:43.97]He cleared the ring pretty much.
[15:45.77]And... Hold on a second.
[15:47.48]Hold on a second!
[15:49.42]Kitty!
[15:50.00]He's gonna do it!
[15:51.26]Through the table!
[15:52.54]Mr. Sneakman has just eliminated Demon Lord Xeroxos and himself in the process!
[15:57.82]Oh my God!
[15:59.52]What have we just witnessed?
[16:01.56]And also Batboy is ma- Who fucking cares about this guy?
[16:04.62]This guy sucks.
[16:05.74]What really matters is Mr. Sneakman saves the day and lets the Rumble continue sacrificing himself for the greater good.
[16:15.28]Thank you, Mr. Sneakman.
[16:16.94]Your duty will not go unnoticed.
[16:19.61]It seems like Xaraxos is very slow to get up here, needing the attention of medical staff to bring him out.
[16:26.28]I think he might have broken his leg on that table.
[16:28.40]Yeah, he's pointing at his leg here.
[16:30.18]Let's hope he does not recover, because fuck this guy, he ruined the whole rumble.
[16:34.95]and after that entire ordeal we are left with just three competitors in the ring and what a shame it is that it's these three guys you're telling me you couldn't have chokeslammed miserable mikey into hell like what is he still doing here you picked count chocula he was doing fantastic why would now there's like three dickheads in the ring and now they're gonna be double teaming now they're gonna do miserable mikey holding the egg back while batboy punches him in the stomach
[17:00.31]and calling for timeout.
[17:01.27]It doesn't work.
[17:01.79]Stop calling timeout.
[17:03.15]It doesn't do it.
[17:03.57]Now Batboy is being held back by the egg.
[17:05.75]These guys are idiots.
[17:07.91]And now here comes the king of all the idiots.
[17:11.23]Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the greatest video game character to ever live.
[17:18.10]I'm talking about Pac-Man.
[17:20.42]Here he comes, coming in at number 14 to GermaRumble3, and he's got a great advantage.
[17:26.26]If you come in in the last five or six, you have such a huge one up on every other competitor that has come in so far.
[17:34.19]He's refreshed, he's naked, and he's ready to go.
[17:37.80]And his first order of business is to throw Mikey over the ropes, not necessarily going for any elimination, while Batboy just did a roundhouse kick and completely missed the egg.
[17:47.17]I don't know if anybody saw that, but I'm sure he did.
[17:49.49]What a block by Pac-Man, one punch, and here comes the second!
[17:52.61]What a blast to his face, knocking him clean, unconscious, while the egg is gonna get thrown over.
[17:57.24]The egg has been eliminated by Batboy.
[18:00.28]Embarrassing egg...
[18:01.88]Hit the showers, you just got eliminated by Batboy.
[18:04.35]And speaking of eliminations, we've got potentially Mikey going over here by Pac-Man and Batboy.
[18:09.03]Is he gonna go over?
[18:09.95]They're holding him up by his butt cheeks, and he doesn't go over, just barely.
[18:14.29]And here comes number 15.
[18:16.88]All the way from your neighborhood classroom.
[18:19.30]He's here.
[18:20.12]He's primed.
[18:21.06]He's ready.
[18:21.76]He's sharpened.
[18:23.20]He is.
[18:25.00]The Pencil!
[18:26.48]First time ever seeing him in the Jerma Arena, making his way down really confident.
[18:31.22]He is stoked to be here.
[18:33.62]He said he sharpened his head to the point where he could stab somebody through the heart and instantly kill them.
[18:38.78]Let's hope he doesn't do that because that would be terrible, and we don't want to see any more characters die at the hands of somebody in this arena tonight.
[18:46.48]Well, Pac-Man gets a lariat by Mikey!
[18:47.98]Pac-Man has been eliminated!
[18:50.48]And look at this temper tantrum he's starting to throw at ringside right now.
[18:53.85]Usually a pretty happy-go-lucky guy.
[18:56.47]Not tonight, though.
[18:57.81]Unfortunately, Pac-Man, you have to go home.
[19:00.47]I don't even know where that is.
[19:02.13]And the pencil could get eliminated as well!
[19:03.75]No, pencil still hangs on to a double attempt at elimination.
[19:09.31]And now it's back to three.
[19:11.09]There has been three in the ring for the last few minutes now.
[19:14.70]We have not seen a crowded ring since Zaraxos destroyed everyone.
[19:19.46]But now we've got number 16 coming in, while Batboy is just looking back and forth like he's at a tennis match.
[19:25.09]I'm not exactly sure what the hell he's doing.
[19:27.95]And that's... that's Jerma.
[19:31.07]Looks a little different.
[19:32.69]Has he lost weight?
[19:34.77]Has he not been going to the gym?
[19:38.44]Oh no, here we go.
[19:39.00]Let's see a couple of push-ups by you, Jeremy.
[19:40.66]Let's show everybody you can do them.
[19:42.18]You did one.
[19:44.10]You did one.
[19:44.76]Okay.
[19:45.42]Very good.
[19:46.24]Get in the ring.
[19:47.44]Batboy is still just looking left and right while Mikey is being pushed over the ropes by the pencil.
[19:52.38]Is he gonna get it?
[19:53.52]He's gonna get it!
[19:54.50]He just tossed Mikey over.
[19:55.48]That's it.
[19:55.82]Mikey is gone.
[19:56.82]He was in there for a little while.
[19:57.94]He survived.
[19:58.98]The final survivor of the Zaraxos tirade has been eliminated.
[20:04.76]And pay attention to these guys that are in here right now, everybody, because these three have a huge percentage chance to win the Jerma Rumble.
[20:13.03]There are only four other contestants physically that are going to come in, and what a toss by Batboy on the pencil.
[20:19.85]I gotta say,
[20:20.91]We have seen some pretty impressive moves by Batboy today.
[20:23.97]I have talked a lot of shit about this guy, but he has done very well with his time in the ring so far.
[20:29.82]And what a block, what a reverse block by Pencil, and a punch to the face by Jermich.
[20:33.12]Could we see Jermich get eliminated?
[20:34.20]No, he reverses it and tosses Pencil into the corner there.
[20:37.43]Well, we have another person coming in at number 17.
[20:41.41]Take a look at this guy.
[20:43.43]Do you see the intensity on that face?
[20:45.75]You can breathe in the determination.
[20:47.83]He's looking for redemption.
[20:49.27]Can you hear that roar?
[20:50.85]That's Gabe Newell.
[20:52.23]Gabe Newell is here at number 17, the sailor of the ship, the queen of Valve, the king of Valve.
[20:59.00]He is everything.
[20:59.94]He is one.
[21:00.82]He is the only Gabe Newell.
[21:02.88]And you gotta figure shit is gonna hit the fan when he gets in the ring here.
[21:06.04]He is not happy with Jerma.
[21:07.42]What a duck by Jerma.
[21:08.38]Gets him into Jerma Suplex and throws him.
[21:10.28]Unbelievable reversal there by Jerma.
[21:12.71]Here comes the grudge match.
[21:14.07]TF2 Community versus Valve.
[21:16.05]All the shit that we talked about end of the line.
[21:18.05]It got to Gabe Newell.
[21:19.19]He's pissed about it.
[21:19.93]What a punch.
[21:20.77]And what two...
[21:21.57]Three!
[21:22.15]What a series of combinations!
[21:23.66]Gabe Newell has a vendetta!
[21:25.88]And he is just taking it out on Jerma's face right now!
[21:28.80]Another right hand!
[21:30.08]Oh no, he gets a block!
[21:31.20]Gets a reversal here!
[21:32.00]Jerma going for a wrist twist!
[21:33.61]It's not gonna happen!
[21:34.53]Gabe Newell is running on pure adrenaline right now!
[21:37.09]Tosses Jerma over the ropes!
[21:38.73]Are we gonna see an elimination?
[21:40.19]Gabe Newell is going to eliminate Jerma!
[21:42.44]He's gone!
[21:43.46]Gabe Newell is cheering into the crowd right now of his elimination of Jerma, and we have another person to call in.
[21:49.42]What a series of events that just was!
[21:52.85]I seriously can't believe that Gabe Newell just came in and kicked the shit out of me.
[21:57.88]Like, he went right for me.
[21:59.54]I didn't program that.
[22:00.64]That, like, happened.
[22:01.34]He just beat the absolute bag out of me and then threw me out.
[22:04.40]Like, I didn't script that.
[22:06.49]Anyways, here comes a beer, and he's gonna go right for Gabe Newell.
[22:09.45]Gabe Newell spins him around and slams him on his back while the pencil almost falls out of the ring after being tossed over by Batboy, who, still, I can't believe is in it.
[22:18.98]I cannot believe this.
[22:20.42]Guys, Batboy's, like, median attributes...
[22:23.42]are, like, 13 out of 100.
[22:24.62]His, like, strength and grappling and dexterity and all that shit is less than 20 for every single one.
[22:31.14]He should have been eliminated a long time ago, but he's still in it for some reason.
[22:34.96]Hey, maybe not for long.
[22:36.62]Pencil's got him on the corner.
[22:37.54]You're gonna possibly throw him over.
[22:39.50]No!
[22:40.46]He gets a hand in the mouth right into... What is... What is Biette doing?
[22:44.95]What the hell is that?
[22:45.75]He was just, like, making origami in front of him.
[22:47.69]He wasn't even, like, touching him.
[22:48.89]And here comes number 18.
[22:49.69]19!
[22:49.71]Sorry!
[22:52.41]You didn't think there was gonna be any more serial characters, did you?
[22:57.75]You didn't think that Sonny the Cocoa Puffs bird was gonna make an appearance at number 19 in the Jerma Rumble!
[23:03.50]Here he is, Sonny!
[23:05.38]He's Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, and he's Cuckoo for the audience too!
[23:08.30]Look at him riling them up, pointing and shouting!
[23:10.24]Everyone's getting so fired up from Cuckoo the Cocoa Puffs, Sonny the bird!
[23:13.69]And now he's in the ring diving over with a beautiful display, they're going right for Batboy!
[23:18.49]Strangely enough, why did he go right for Batboy?
[23:20.93]Batboy and Gabe Newell were in sort of a little tussle there, but he may have been listening to me backstage.
[23:26.53]There's a monitor back there.
[23:28.01]He just definitely heard me talking about his low attributes, and he's gonna take this to his advantage.
[23:32.75]He's gonna push over Batboy.
[23:33.77]Yes, Sonny the Bird's gonna do it.
[23:34.95]Sonny the Bird's gonna toss him.
[23:36.30]He tosses him.
[23:36.94]That's it.
[23:37.32]Batboy has been eliminated.
[23:38.90]Sonny using insider trading.
[23:42.26]to be able to throw Batboy over the ropes there, which is sort of unfortunate for Batboy because he went far, and now Sonny is sort of just standing around not doing anything.
[23:51.39]He went for the easy route, and now he's just chilling out.
[23:54.03]Well, we have another competitor coming in.
[23:55.65]This is the final competitor, the final person in Jerma Rumble 3 is... It's Tony the Tiger!
[24:04.07]Do you hear this crowd right now?
[24:06.09]This is the loudest I've ever heard the Jermania crowd screaming for Tony the Tiger, the most physically fit, the most positively influenceable, the best serial character in a lot of people's opinions.
[24:17.34]Here he comes for the first time ever, Tony the Tiger, rounding out the number 20 spot.
[24:22.24]Finally, the last person is in, and one of these five is going to be crowned Jerma Rumble 3 champion.
[24:30.86]And there is a high chance it's gonna be another serial character.
[24:35.10]So, place your bets now.
[24:37.36]Somebody in this ring is going to win.
[24:40.95]Will it be the much-deserved Gabe Newell victory that we've all been waiting for?
[24:45.07]Could it be a revival of the Biaz?
[24:47.25]Could the Biaz take it?
[24:48.61]Could Gabe Newell just clothesline Sonny the Bird over the top ropes?
[24:51.48]Yes, he will!
[24:52.84]See you later, Sonny.
[24:54.32]And now there are four.
[24:56.20]You see, this is where fatigue, this is where the nerves, this is where the computer AI, which one isn't a moron, this, all this stuff comes into play at the very end of a Jerma Rumble.
[25:06.14]You see, we've got the Bia now and Gabe Newell in the corner, two very heavy characters.
[25:10.59]The Bia and Gabe Newell, very large characters.
[25:13.25]Gabe Newell, with ease, seems to pick up the Bia on the top turnbuckle.
[25:16.63]Can he do it?
[25:17.27]He's very heavy.
[25:18.49]Is he that strong?
[25:19.91]He is!
[25:20.81]Gabe Newell just eliminated Pierre846.
[25:23.26]That's another elimination that you can tally onto Gabe Newell.
[25:27.54]He has been on a spree.
[25:29.30]It looks like him and TonyTheTiger are going to... No, it's a reversal!
[25:32.00]The pencil just reversed that double DDT attempt.
[25:34.96]What a fantastic
[25:37.04]Double reversal that was by The Pencil.
[25:39.33]You just don't see reversals like that anymore.
[25:41.97]Let alone from a character that's as shitty as The Pencil.
[25:44.53]Now Gabe Newell.
[25:45.47]Gabe Newell on the defensive.
[25:46.95]Gabe Newell might be eliminated right here by two of these assholes.
[25:49.83]No, he ends up getting out of it, punches him both in the head.
[25:52.34]And for Tony the Tiger's trouble, he's gonna get thrown over.
[25:54.86]Could Gabe Newell get another elimination here?
[25:57.48]Could it be possible?
[25:58.42]Is Tony the Tiger gonna fight back?
[25:59.68]Is The Pencil gonna rescue him?
[26:00.79]No, Gabe Newell has just eliminated Tony the Tiger as well.
[26:04.35]Unbelievable.
[26:06.27]Gabe Newell, that's like five eliminations, almost in a row for Gabe Newell.
[26:10.98]And now we are down to the final two.
[26:12.88]These are the final competitors, The Pencil,
[26:16.10]and Gabe Newell.
[26:17.61]One of these two is going to be crowned Jerma Rumble 3 champion.
[26:21.41]Will it be the shit character, or will it be the most beloved man in the history of PC gaming?
[26:27.23]And he throws over the pencil, body-to-back suplex, and he might have possibly injured his face on that somehow.
[26:33.80]What a reversal, what a block and an elbow to Gabe Newell's face, almost blinding him, punching him in the eye.
[26:38.54]only seeming to irritate Gabe Newell just a little bit, while he gets him with a big boot right to his gut there, throws him over the ropes, and they both bounce into each other.
[26:46.27]I think Gabe Newell had a different strategy there, and he didn't utilize it.
[26:50.25]Maybe going for a powerbomb, his patented finishing move, the powerbomb, no!
[26:53.81]Gonna try and maybe end this right now.
[26:56.26]No, he's just taunting, maybe catching his breath a little bit after all that.
[26:58.86]He did eliminate a bunch of people after all.
[27:01.08]And the pencil was probably very low on his priorities for who he should eliminate.
[27:05.79]And dear God, he just threw him across the entire ring!
[27:09.83]And the pencil is hurt.
[27:11.41]The pencil is really hurt right now.
[27:13.31]May have a broken leg.
[27:14.59]Gabe Newell being a good guy, checking on him, making sure.
[27:17.37]No.
[27:18.83]No.
[27:19.43]What a cheap shot that was.
[27:21.51]He cheap shot him.
[27:22.59]He hit Gabe Newell right in his family jewels.
[27:25.00]No, this can't be it.
[27:26.22]It can't end like this.
[27:27.64]Gabe Newell's holding up a dear life.
[27:29.20]Can the pencil eliminate Gabe Newell after that cheap shot?
[27:32.70]That's the end!
[27:33.96]The Pencil has won Jerma Rumble 3 on a cheap low blow.
[27:39.79]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[27:41.97]You've got to be kidding me.
[27:43.17]Gabe Newell cannot believe what just happened, and neither can I, and neither can this crowd.
[27:49.21]Do we really have to crown this guy Jerma Rumble champion?
[27:53.16]In the rule books, we do.
[27:55.02]Ladies and gentlemen, your Jerma Rumble 3 champion, The Pencil.
[28:06.53]Jerma Rumble 3 is in the books, and I'll see you at the next event.
