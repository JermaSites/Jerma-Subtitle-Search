[02:50.20]I just tried to throw this through the window, and it's like, ah, no.
[02:52.20]Sorry, dude.
[02:52.54]You have to do the tutorial.
[02:54.49]Okay.
[02:58.91]How do I put it down?
[02:59.63]E?
[03:06.93]Washer and dryer.
[03:14.88]Okay.
[03:15.78]So this is a cheap used dryer.
[03:18.30]Cheap used washing machine.
[03:20.62]I fucked it up already.
[03:21.50]The dryer goes on the right side.
[03:23.49]And I'm very, very upset about it.
[03:26.09]I already screwed it up.
[03:26.97]Okay.
[03:27.35]Open the laundry store.
[03:30.23]Alright.
[03:43.92]Okay.
[03:44.88]After picking up the laundry that the customer placed, you can see the progress of said laundry from this indicator.
[03:51.02]I have to do the laundry?
[03:53.56]I thought I just ran the store.
[03:54.58]I have to do the laundry.
[03:59.28]Okay, so it's washed, dried, ironed, folded.
[04:03.96]First, put the dirty laundry into the washing machine.
[04:06.72]The indicator will turn blue once it's done.
[04:08.66]Okay.
[04:24.50]Next, put the laundry into the drying machine.
[04:34.99]Afterwards, you can iron the laundry to increase tips.
[04:37.08]This is an optional step, so you can always skip it.
[04:44.84]Why is the ironing station all the way over here?
[04:50.49]Drag the iron to the red spots to iron the shirt.
[04:55.70]That's loud.
[05:02.54]What is this lady's clothes?
[05:06.38]Fold the laundry by going to the folding table.
[05:14.51]Follow the arrows to fold the shirt.
[05:25.08]When all is done, place the laundry on the shelf and wait for the customer to come pick it up.
[05:28.44]You can keep track of a customer's laundry by checking the basket number.
[05:31.55]Put it on the shelf.
[05:34.59]Okay.
[05:36.77]Okay, wait for the customer to return.
[05:44.19]This is number one.
[05:59.57]There are ways to get more tips.
[06:00.85]Some people come in with no clothes on?
[06:05.03]There are ways to get more tips from your trusty customers.
[06:08.96]Ironing and removing fur from their clothes can give you extra tips, but to get the biggest tip, you need to make sure that you treat your customer like kings.
[06:18.44]Why does this guy have no clothes?
[06:24.23]The store will automatically be closed at 10 p.m.
[06:27.41]Check your daily report at the report table in your office.
[06:30.85]You can read your results for today and continue to the next day.
[06:33.15]Alright, let's go.
[06:34.69]Go to the report table.

[47:43.63]The thing that goes...
[48:00.45]And it starts up too.

[57:53.38]I'll be there at the end of today.
[57:55.04]I just need to do 10 more customers.
[57:56.10]Alright, who's out here?
[58:05.11]Okay, it's you.
[58:08.49]Help hungry.
[58:09.29]Hey, what about the money I gave you yesterday?

[58:47.49]Hey, sorry.
[58:48.09]I'm Miss Coon.
[58:49.55]I work here at the haunted house.
[58:53.98]Wash them for me, okay?
[59:13.06]I will.
[59:13.90]Alright, let me check the other quests.
[59:21.89]Okay.
[59:22.41]Please be a good person.
[59:23.23]Don't litter.
[59:23.77]Hello, please help me.
[59:27.23]Why?
[59:27.83]Um, what happened?
[59:28.91]Please don't tell anyone.
[59:29.85]Okay.
[59:30.93]Come, follow me.
[59:43.09]What the hell is going on back here?
[59:50.55]Is it a reindeer?
[59:51.51]So my friends and I found Santa's reindeer.
[59:59.86]But he's weird.
[60:00.56]Maybe he's sick.
[60:02.97]I told you this is just a normal deer.
[60:05.73]Santa's not real.
[60:07.65]Santa is real.
[60:08.79]Anyway, can you help me find a big palm leaf plant for him to eat?
[60:14.22]Maybe he's hungry, but he didn't want to eat the grass where he fed him.
[60:25.61]Do I have to go find five of these?
[60:30.21]Okay.
[60:36.53]So I gotta bring... Did it say high voltage?
[60:44.24]Oh, no trespassing.
[60:45.46]Okay.
[60:49.10]I didn't talk to you yet.
[60:50.31]Let's see what you do.
[60:53.47]Agent 001.
[60:56.98]Hey.
[60:58.20]Here, I need your help.
[60:59.62]You own this laundry, right?
[61:00.86]Yes.
[61:01.74]I'm Agent 001.
[61:03.63]My intel told me that a criminal will be coming here.
[61:06.57]Whatever they ask, just say, I don't know, okay?
[61:09.51]Act normal.
[61:10.03]Don't let them get suspicious.
[61:26.57]Alright.
[61:27.49]I'm going to clean this.
[61:42.74]Almost at rank two.
[61:43.50]I'm going to upgrade the more detergent.
[61:51.03]40 bucks.
[61:57.20]Yeah.
[61:57.98]Better detergent.
[62:06.50]Can I do that again?
[62:07.00]Did I say fuck?
[62:12.11]Fuck.
[62:14.81]Okay.
[62:18.12]I'll probably get some money for doing this.
[62:19.16]Let's see.
[62:31.61]I'm so annoyed we didn't get our comic book.
[62:33.21]He said you can resell it.
[62:44.18]Where's the music?
[62:45.68]I turned it off.
[62:50.24]We need some royalty free piano music in the background.
[62:52.40]Alright, what do I get for this one?
[62:57.76]So I got $20 in tips.
[62:58.76]I need to manually serve 10 more customers and I am at the next rank.
[63:08.25]Thanks a lot, honey.
[63:09.17]They smell amazing now.
[63:11.21]Oh, right.
[63:11.59]Sorry, honey.
[63:11.97]I forgot my wallet back at the attraction.
[63:14.38]I'll pay you later.
[63:16.92]I'll pay you later or I'll haunt you.
[63:19.94]Thanks again.
[63:20.48]Gotta run.
[63:25.35]Is there even a point to doing any of those?
[63:27.79]I'll buy your item for 10% of its original price.
[63:30.83]Secondhand... Wait, it's a pawn shop?
[63:35.06]Oh, I'm not a comic reseller.
[63:36.30]Maybe you need to add... Wait, I have it?
[63:41.70]Wait, is this... Hey, what's that on your hand?
[63:53.64]Limited edition Two Pies comic.
[64:00.52]I just activated it.
[64:02.70]Uh, who are you?
[64:04.10]Let me introduce myself.
[64:05.24]I'm Amihar, a comic reseller and collector.
[64:08.26]What you have on your hand, a rare and expensive comic.
[64:10.70]Would you like to trade?
[64:11.40]I'll even throw in some cash.
[64:13.48]I'll take 300 bucks.
[64:16.26]Also take this.
[64:16.90]It's another limited edition comic that I have.
[64:23.99]Now I can afford way more shit.
[64:26.71]That's better than running a laundry store.
[64:31.89]I'm doing the quests.
[64:40.52]Do you see any of those things that pick up the plants or whatever?
[64:43.10]I don't see any more plants.
[64:46.64]Now I can buy some real shit.
[64:47.74]Hold on.
[64:49.90]Should I get a better laundry machines now?
[64:51.42]Sell the other ones?
[64:55.50]Coin washer?
[64:59.48]I can afford these.
[65:02.64]Alright, I'm selling some of this shit.
[65:03.80]Let me get rid of it.
[65:07.79]Sell this piece of crap.
[65:11.87]Put it in inventory.
[65:14.13]Can I sell it across the street?
[65:22.58]A dollar?! !
[65:33.56]$1?
[65:36.20]Fuck your secondhand store.
[65:37.54]$1.30.
[65:50.88]Okay.
[65:52.14]I'm not doing that.
[65:55.90]Give another $100?
[65:56.28]No.
[65:56.34]I'm... No.
[66:01.14]I'm going to buy a set of new washers and dryers.
[66:08.49]I'm going to get two, three, no, four of these.
[66:13.11]And four of these.
[66:16.50]Bingo.
[66:19.36]Get rid of all the other crappy ones.
[66:28.69]I'll keep some shitty ones over here.
[66:38.23]About two washers, two dryers over here.
[66:42.03]Of the kind of shitty ones.
[66:47.55]I think that's fine.
[66:51.07]There's a plant in the second hand store?
[66:52.63]No way.
[66:59.84]There is.
[67:01.98]How do I get it?
[67:04.42]Shit, I can't get it.
[67:08.61]Oh well.
[67:17.45]That's not the right one.
[67:18.31]Alright, let me get the all these new washers.
[67:25.16]Oh yeah, this is going to now it's going to be so much easier now.
[67:33.64]We just unlocked the ability to have fun and game.
[67:39.46]I need to be level 5 for the Lint Roller, unfortunately.
[67:41.88]Right there.
[68:07.33]It's not perfect, I don't care.
[68:23.88]Much more efficient operation.

[73:06.89]Can you, I want you to do a stream where you make bronze out of nothing but rocks.
[73:12.91]Make bronze.
[73:17.68]Like a glass blowing stream would be really fun.
[73:20.48]Although that's a lot.
[73:21.90]That's a lot of shit to do.
[73:30.51]I can't wait till I can get my first employee here.

[73:57.88]Is this 50 bucks?
[74:09.57]Wait, this is not dirty.
[74:10.59]I need to dry it.
[74:11.17]Alright, five more customers and I'm leveled up.
[74:42.78]Shit's heavy.
[74:47.10]You should do a U versus Wild stream.
[74:50.56]Uh, I... No.
[74:53.75]That requires me to go outside and spend more than 30 to 40 minutes letting the sun just hit me in the face.
[75:07.15]I like being outside, but I like being controlled outside.
[75:13.30]I don't want to live outside.
[75:17.48]I'm the kind of guy that if you see one mosquito, you go, well, that's it for the day.
[75:22.23]It was a good day.
[75:23.54]Let's get inside.
[75:44.19]We're on an air fryer stream.
[75:45.91]That doesn't even make any sense.
[75:48.45]You just... Some of you guys just have the word air fryer in your head.
[75:51.70]And you're just like, I want to just write... I'm going to type the word air fryer.
[75:56.80]I'm just going to type it right now.
[75:58.16]And I'm going to say, hey, you should eat an air fryer.
[76:00.41]Alright.
[76:13.78]I'm never gonna have an air fryer.
[76:15.70]You know why?
[76:16.20]Because I don't... I want the grease, okay?
[76:20.51]I want, like, the grease all over it.
[76:40.99]Yeah, biting into a chicken wing or a chicken finger and it's like... You can taste the batter.
[76:46.99]I don't want it to be like airy and poppy.
[76:50.76]No, I want it to be fucking greasy.
[77:12.78]I got way too much shit here.
[77:13.92]I gotta hurry up.
[77:15.75]And this is a linty one.
[77:17.07]What are you looking for?
[77:25.90]Eight.
[77:29.60]Shit, shit.
[77:33.45]Uh, this is dirty.
[77:41.87]Does Linty get it?
[77:42.85]Hey, it's just what I do.
[77:46.02]I don't know why I said that.
[77:57.88]Perfect timing.
[78:02.92]You're doing this very inefficiently.
[78:07.33]Yeah, but I'm on the phone.
[78:08.63]I have my right shoulder is pressed up against my head.
[78:11.33]And I'm talking on the phone while doing all this.
[78:27.86]Clean this place up.
[78:28.62]This place looks like shit.
[78:35.67]There's so many baskets that are not done.
[78:46.04]Ugh.
[78:58.61]I want to do more like dry food streams.
[79:00.69]I think those are fun too.
[79:04.11]But that'll just be kind of whenever I feel like it.
[79:11.78]I got way too much shit.
[79:13.64]I'm gonna have to just let these go.
[79:33.46]Let's try creamed corn.
[79:39.90]Creamed corn is probably not even bad.
[79:42.35]It's just all the cartoons and TV shows back in the 80s and 90s just made it look gross.
[79:48.41]So nobody wanted to eat it anymore.
[79:52.53]It was the gross lunch menu item and everything.
[79:55.15]Oh, gross.
[79:55.89]But it's probably great.
[79:57.17]I don't think I've ever had it.
[79:58.89]Is it disgusting?
[79:59.49]What's it?
[79:59.75]What is in it?
[80:02.23]What are the ingredients of creamed corn?
[80:03.87]And I know it's like, oh, it's cream and corn.
[80:05.35]But like, what are the actual ingredients?
[80:08.11]What is it?
[80:14.56]It's corn.
[80:17.06]But it's just sweet and corn.
[80:19.58]I bet it's good.
[80:20.28]It's probably awesome.
[80:23.54]You guys are haters.
[80:26.53]Don't let like every show of every cartoon on Nickelodeon from 1997 make you not want to eat cream corn.
[80:45.71]Also liver and onions.
[80:47.09]That was also a meme one that oh no liver.
[80:50.48]That's gross.
[80:51.40]That is confirmed gross.
[80:52.88]So that's one that they got right.
[80:57.43]16.
[80:57.45]I tried to eat it.
[81:05.04]I tried to like it.
[81:06.14]I tried to just I'm going to force myself to like this because it's good for you.
[81:10.50]But no, I cannot.
[81:11.76]It tastes fucking terrible.
[81:18.01]It just it's genuinely awful.
[81:28.06]Some people have a palate for it.
[81:29.28]Some people really like it.
[81:30.26]I am not one of those people.
[81:31.26]I just can't.
[81:31.86]It just tastes like... I don't like blood.
[81:34.98]Oh, do you want to eat solid blood?
[81:40.09]No, I don't.
[81:41.31]I really just don't.
[81:47.15]I can taste the metal.
[81:48.85]Like the iron.
[81:49.67]It's a huge, heavy iron food.
[81:51.55]I feel like I can taste it.
[82:05.84]Uh, here you go.
[82:06.74]Thank you.
[82:11.30]Sounds like kind of nasty stuff that British people eat.
[82:17.17]I feel like British people, British food gets a pretty bad rap, doesn't it?
[82:27.42]What if you put liver in the air fryer?
[82:30.18]No, dude.
[82:30.84]Alright.
[82:31.44]This guy doesn't get the aux.
[82:33.72]Ah, no.
[82:34.12]Take the aux away from that guy.
[82:35.38]Uh-uh.
[82:36.96]Hey, hey.
[82:53.70]Doug Funny back in the day didn't like liver and onions.
[82:57.85]And it doesn't matter how much Mr. Dink told him it was good.
[83:00.15]He was like, no, they're gross.
[83:02.97]He didn't eat it.
[83:04.05]And I know the end of the show, he eats it and he goes, whoa, dear journal, liver and onions is not disgusting.
[83:11.82]It was propaganda.
[83:12.42]That was fucking propaganda.
[83:16.06]It just was.
[83:53.37]I mean I get it though because
[83:57.42]Hey, what's a food that people have a bad impression of that maybe we can make a good impression of?
[84:02.45]This might even be a different food.
[84:04.61]Did Doug Funny eat liver and onions?
[84:06.69]Or did I just make an episode up?
[84:08.15]Am I thinking of green eggs and ham?
[84:17.15]What are you doing?
[84:18.87]Don't track mud in here.
[84:19.77]I gotta clean this.
[84:28.87]Yes, it was an episode.
[84:29.95]Okay.
[84:31.47]Then he holds his nose and he's like, Oh no.
[84:36.79]And then he's... And then it goes like... Upgrade the lint roller.
[84:54.07]We'll see how much money I have at the end of the day.
[84:55.39]I think I'm good.
[84:57.26]I think that's everybody.
[85:01.82]Alright, I should be able to upgrade the entire laundromat now.

[87:06.82]I don't think I've ever had boiled peanuts.
[87:10.84]Okay, stock the shelf.
[87:12.65]Don't forget to keep the stocks up or your customers might be annoyed.

[89:14.91]Market price?
[89:15.43]Making this $2.50.
[89:16.21]Is that too high?
[89:16.57]I'll make it $1.00.
[89:17.91]How about $1.25? $1.25.
[89:40.12]That's a rip-off.
[89:40.84]It's too low.
[89:44.08]Well, I can't read it's too low and then it's too high in the same sentence.
[89:53.53]Swipey.

[98:32.26]His speed is set to zero.
[98:35.67]Why would he be at zero speed?
[98:43.51]It's $240.
[98:43.67]Unlock movement?
[98:44.29]No, dude.

[101:19.76]Or maybe if Do Nothing David actually could cash people out instead of just standing there looking at people.
[101:28.54]He's even slow doing that too.
[101:29.83]He's fired.
[101:46.91]I'm so glad I don't have to do that folding bullshit anymore.
[101:49.90]That sucked.
[101:51.14]I'm so glad that I don't have to do this ever again.
[101:55.52]It's so much better.
[101:56.50]This is great.
[102:05.40]Alright, we're starting to get a feel for it.
[102:15.57]Nice.
[102:16.30]Yeah.
[102:22.86]Shit's going so much better now.
[102:25.43]Oh, I'll get that for you, sir.
[102:26.93]Okay, there you go.
[102:27.87]That's the only thing I do.
[102:30.79]I don't know how to operate the register.
[102:33.84]Oh, sorry about that.
[102:44.39]Oh, yeah, of course, that number six.
[102:46.37]Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[102:48.35]That one's yours.
[102:53.14]Hmm, four, eight, seven, I don't know.
[102:55.20]I'm not so sure.
[103:02.20]This is one of the... Hold on, I gotta... No!
[103:07.41]Do your job?
[103:08.25]I'm washing the fucking dishes and cleaning the stuff.
[103:36.34]Look right in the lens.
[103:37.18]This is your punishment for not doing shit.
[103:54.55]You don't even know.
[103:55.13]Okay.
[104:00.59]Do nothing David is... He's actually... I actually don't hate him.
[104:06.40]It's the less that I have to do.
[104:07.82]Why is none of this folded?
[104:11.26]What is he doing?
[104:12.24]This is dirty fucking clothes.
[104:14.10]I'm pissed at him now.
[104:15.88]Why is he storing this here?
[104:19.65]Why are you doing that?
[104:20.53]You know, I'm trying to run an establishment here.
[104:23.25]Trying to run a good, clean establishment and you want to put the dirty clothes up there?
[104:26.65]Why don't you be more like
[104:40.77]Ellen!
[104:44.80]Why don't you be more like Ellen?
[104:47.94]There.
[104:48.36]Excellent job, Ellen.
[104:50.06]Wonderful work.
[104:58.78]Gotta do everything around here.
[105:00.38]This fucking shit establishment.
[105:05.01]Run the family business.
[105:06.01]Yeah, good idea.
[105:09.64]I didn't want to do this.
[105:10.38]I wanted to be an engineer.
[105:11.31]I still am.
[105:27.05]I just rewired the entire business's Ethernet.
[105:30.63]The fuck have you done?
[105:43.69]If you're paying him $2, he's probably incompetent.
[105:51.61]Yeah, that's, that's not a good salary.
[105:54.75]Alright.
[105:55.49]Able to process mini Mart.
[105:59.19]I can't afford it.
[105:59.95]It's 1100 bucks to get this guy to cash people out.
[106:05.38]Let's give him a 10% increase.
[106:07.08]What?
[106:09.02]Whatever.
[106:19.81]That's not even minimum wage.
[106:21.03]I can't... I only... I only have $200.
[106:24.08]How come nobody's buying this?
[106:34.58]Uh...
[106:48.79]Can I sell some bleach?
[106:59.72]He's doing the exact proper amount for $2 a day.
[107:02.12]That is very true.
[107:05.58]How we doing?
[107:06.54]Actually, this has been pretty smooth.
[107:12.39]Here you go.
[107:12.85]Number eight.
[107:15.90]And surface with a smile.
[107:17.58]That's right.
[107:18.08]Make sure you smile.
[107:21.42]Keep that fucking smile on.
[107:33.95]Did you ever help Santa's reindeer?
[107:35.95]Uh, no.
[107:36.55]I didn't even know what it was.
[107:37.70]I didn't get it.
[107:52.45]Where's her laundry?
[107:56.60]Where's 10?
[108:03.06]Unfinished laundry order?
[108:04.34]What do you mean unfinished?
[108:06.98]Uh-oh.
[108:12.83]I thought you didn't have to iron it.
[108:20.99]Now we're going to get a bad review.
[108:25.35]Miss, I am so sorry.
[108:27.49]We'll do better next time.
[108:29.49]Look, how about on the way out, we'll give you a free sample of Dick's Cleaner.
[108:38.89]You see what fucking happens?
[108:39.73]You see what fucking happens when we don't do things right?
[108:42.21]Do you see what happens?
[108:43.38]You fucking get it now?
[108:44.30]Do you both get it?
[108:47.32]That's gonna be a 3.5 out of 5.
[108:51.38]Let's see where she already is.
[108:52.08]I gotta fucking spam refresh our goddamn page.
[108:56.14]She better not be mentioning me.
[109:07.15]You're embarrassing me.
[109:14.87]We're closed.
[109:15.39]You can go home, by the way.
[109:27.36]Coin laundry room.
[109:28.38]I have a new room.
[109:34.74]Ooh.
[109:40.64]Nice.
[109:47.37]Okay.
[109:49.87]I unlocked coin laundry.
[109:54.31]Wait, there's more.
[109:54.93]What else do I have to do?
[110:00.92]coin okay cheap uh I can only afford like one of these wait cheap coin washer is this a combo
[110:27.07]When buying a coin laundry machine, it must be placed in the designated room.
[110:29.81]Otherwise, it becomes unusable.
[110:32.03]You'll notice when placing the machine in the non-designated room outside the laundry, the light indicator will become red.
[110:36.94]Okay.
[110:37.18]Where the hell is it?
[110:47.97]It's a completely different room.
[110:49.51]Ah, it's a totally different room.
[111:00.43]By having a coin laundry machine, your customers can now do the laundry themselves.
[111:04.57]Whenever a customer uses a coin laundry machine, they'll insert a coin in the machine to use it.
[111:08.68]When they're done, you can claim the coins by interacting with the coin slot.
[111:13.50]Cool.
[111:21.26]So I need to wait for another day.
[111:22.32]Alright.
[111:25.32]We have gone through an hour.
[111:26.96]I'm going to get up.
[111:29.65]I'm having fun.
[111:31.04]This game started off a little slow, but I actually am... I think it's really fun.
[111:36.80]It's cute.
[111:42.02]I'll be right back.
[111:45.17]Ads will start playing here in about 15 seconds or so.
[111:49.83]See you in a minute.
[111:51.55]I want to turn the radio off so I can put my own song on.
[111:57.94]Alright, here we go.
[115:30.70]Hello?
[115:36.36]Okay.
[115:37.84]I just sat back down.
[115:39.72]You dance into the music in your room?
[115:43.86]I mean, it's a banger.
[115:52.67]Made a little drink.
[115:56.19]I made a
[115:58.27]Put a little pink lemonade into a bottle of water and I shook it up.
[116:04.06]My little pink, um, my little pink, um, drink.
[116:08.50]It's good.
[116:08.82]Alright.
[116:20.71]That sounds good.
[116:23.15]So a lot of the, a lot of the store, like the store brand lemonades or strawberry lemonade or raspberry lemonade, they're a little too much.
[116:35.84]I feel like they're way too sugary and they're kind of like syrupy.
[116:40.55]So you can make them last a long time.
[116:43.75]If you just mix them with water, just kind of split it up.
[116:47.65]Even like 70, 30 water to strawberry lemonade.
[116:52.53]It still tastes great.
[116:55.08]It's kind of exactly where I want it.
[116:57.24]And it lasts three times as long.
[117:04.62]When you say water, do you mean straight vodka?
[117:11.43]Sometimes you just want a little sugar.
[117:13.25]But not a ton of sugar.
[117:15.95]And I know I could... Here we go.
[117:17.26]Like health Andy.
[117:20.38]But...
[117:21.97]A lot of stuff has, it's like 20, 30, 40 grams of sugar in 12 ounces.
[117:28.79]That's your entire daily intake.
[117:31.46]It's your entire daily intake of sugar in one glass.
[117:40.78]12 ounce glass, 70, 30 vodka lemonade.
[117:43.14]Ooh.
[117:46.53]You're talking about the 70 is the lemonade, right?
[117:59.22]Your daily recommended amount of sugar is actually zero.
[118:03.00]Well, but I, you know what?
[118:03.86]That's no fun.
[118:05.66]That's no fun.
[118:11.75]Remember what I always say.
[118:14.69]Remember where I got this from.
[118:18.11]All things in moderation.
[118:22.71]You know who says that?
[118:24.79]Uh-huh.
[118:26.23]That's right.
[118:27.92]Yep.
[118:29.17]Okay.
[118:33.44]No.
[118:35.16]Uh, I, uh... What's going on?
[118:41.84]Oh, start.
[118:48.13]What?
[118:48.51]Oh.
[118:56.40]I only earned $3?
[118:56.94]No.
[118:57.04]We're good.
[118:57.54]Are you drunk?
[119:00.24]No, I just made a funny laugh.
[119:02.24]I went... The market price has changed.
[119:07.74]Uh-oh.
[119:12.95]That's fine.
[119:16.91]No, it didn't.
[119:19.81]This shit didn't change at all.
[119:22.36]Why not?
[119:23.98]I still have to figure out a bunch of digestive shit.
[119:27.33]I can't really drink or do... I can't really do much of anything right now.
[119:31.87]Still in the middle of it.
[119:34.58]Uh, okay.
[119:35.04]Everyone's paid.
[119:36.70]So that should be fine.
[119:43.63]I'm ready just to go.
[119:44.89]This is going to be much, much better.
[119:47.49]Here we go.
[119:48.79]Coin machine is ready.
[119:49.67]Ready for a new day.

[120:21.08]What's that worth to you?
[120:25.04]What's the value on that?
[120:27.26]And I want a chat consensus on this.
[120:29.13]What's the value for that?
[120:42.93]10 minutes of our time.

[120:48.43]Alright.
[120:59.99]100 million.
[121:00.31]I have plenty of bleach.
[121:08.24]Naughty customer in the area.
[121:09.94]What does that mean?
[121:12.00]Sometimes there are naughty customers that will use your PC for inappropriate stuff.
[121:16.98]To get rid of them, hit them.
[121:17.74]What do you mean?
[121:18.18]How is somebody alive?
[121:18.88]Is somebody in my office?
[121:21.59]Is somebody in my office right now looking at porn?
[121:27.89]What?

[121:47.60]That just freaked me out.
[121:48.96]I was on a roll.
[121:49.82]Is this the guy?
[121:56.45]Hold on.
[121:58.53]What does he do?
[122:00.85]He goes in the back and goes into my office.
[122:04.38]And...
[122:12.05]What does that do?
[122:12.53]Does that do... Why do I care?
[122:16.05]I don't understand what the... Why do I care?
[122:20.01]I get like, I mean, get out of here that you're a weirdo, but why would that be... I don't understand.

[133:42.97]Wait, there's a couple more missions.
[133:47.05]Excuse me, are you the owner of this laundry?
[133:48.59]Yes.
[133:49.51]Could you help me wash my aide's clothes?
[133:53.14]My team just finished their training and their clothes are very dirty.
[133:55.40]Please.
[133:58.37]Um, okay.
[134:15.52]What about... There's one more, too.
[134:20.04]What do you want to do?

[134:25.16]How do I get in here?
[134:35.25]How do you get in there?
[134:35.93]Huh?
[134:49.76]Did it crouch?
[134:51.44]Can I just not see it?
[134:52.54]Why can I not see it?
[134:55.80]Oh my God.
[134:56.54]Okay.
[135:00.18]You're going to give me money?
[135:02.75]Great job.
[135:03.45]How did you know?
[135:04.44]Sorry, I planted a listening device on you when you weren't looking.
[135:07.86]Anyway, I heard they're coming back tomorrow, right?
[135:09.52]I'll be hiding behind the tree next door.
[135:12.46]Wait until they ask you to clean their clothes, then let me know.
[135:15.04]Okay.
[135:30.49]You put this laundry in the wrong machine?! !
[135:35.32]What are you talking about?
[135:36.02]What do you mean?
[135:36.90]There's a different kind of washing machine?
[135:38.68]I don't get it.
[135:55.43]It was dirty?
[136:05.84]Now this is clean.
[136:10.58]Hopefully I get some money for this.
[136:11.76]Like 500 bucks.
[136:24.62]Bro, you forgot how cleaning works.
[136:27.08]I put it in the laundry machine.
[136:28.42]This is perfect.
[136:29.34]Washed, dried, ironed, folded.
[136:30.90]Alright, give me money.
[136:43.02]Cash.
[136:43.98]Thank you.
[136:44.42]The uniform smells so fresh.
[136:45.52]Oh, and I have another request.
[136:47.91]It's my nephew's birthday today, but I forgot to buy him a gift.
[136:50.51]Could you please help me find a gift?
[136:53.65]He really likes plants, so please buy any kind of plant.
[136:58.20]I got a cactus on my desk.
[137:04.94]Will he take a cactus?
[137:23.67]Thank you.
[137:24.03]You're a very kind person.
[137:25.00]I'll be coming here often.
[137:26.00]Maybe I'll even become your loyal customer.
[137:27.84]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[137:29.82]Tomorrow, I'll let you know whether he likes the gift or not.
[137:31.98]Thank you.
[137:35.95]Well, that was mine, and I don't know where I got it, but I just gave you... That's a very sentimental piece for me.
[137:41.73]Alright, you need another... You want another hundred bucks?
[137:43.81]Fine.
[137:47.46]Now, don't gamble it.
[137:48.52]I won't.
[137:48.84]Anyway, gotta eat.
[137:49.54]Bye.
[137:55.06]What's that?
[137:56.50]Get your free tickets.
[137:57.80]Cinema two.
[138:09.78]Cinema two, seven, nine 50.
[138:11.40]Okay.
[138:26.73]Thank you, I guess.
[138:38.10]Time for a new day.
[138:42.72]Made $155.
[138:44.00]The coin laundry is going to go crazy the next few days.
[138:46.14]Watch this.
[138:56.52]Oh, here we go.
[138:57.84]Okay.
[139:00.02]He said he's going to hide behind this tree, right?
[139:02.40]Let's first talk to the officer.
[139:05.68]My nephew really likes the gift.
[139:08.36]But I have another favor.
[139:09.22]My boss just retired and he's one of your loyal laundry customers.
[139:13.72]I was thinking, is there anything you could give me?
[139:15.33]Something that could remind my boss of your laundry?
[139:19.61]Laundry machine miniature from the decor app.
[139:28.81]Who the fuck are... I don't want to get... What?
[139:32.72]That's a shitty gift.
[139:41.35]I haven't bought any of this stuff.
[139:52.48]Guys, it's been here, though.
[139:56.12]I could just buy... I have to buy five of these.
[140:04.53]Um, okay.
[140:05.61]What does he want?
[140:12.00]What the hell does he... What does he want, though?
[140:21.61]I don't see what I don't, what is it?
[140:23.65]Do I not have access to it?
[140:27.99]I might not be high enough level laundry washing laundry machine miniature.
[140:40.24]It's probably one of these.
[140:41.16]Yeah.
[140:44.70]Rank five.
[140:45.30]Okay.
[140:45.76]Well, that's fine.
[140:48.84]What about the, where's the secret agent guy?
[140:54.68]He said he'd talk to me after you get his laundry.
[140:59.88]Hey.
[141:01.50]I got some laundry for you.
[141:02.84]But first, could you do me a favor?
[141:03.92]I hate how dirty the street is in front of the garden across from your store.
[141:06.90]It's an eyesore.
[141:08.36]Could you clean it up?
[141:10.08]Uh, I don't know.
[141:11.50]Weirdo, fine.
[141:12.22]I'll just please clean the street.
[141:22.99]Where is he?
[141:28.92]Did he say he was going to be hiding here?
[141:38.19]Clean the street.
[141:47.65]Is it across from my store?
[141:49.19]OK, fine.
[142:06.13]Now please wash my clothes.
[142:09.91]They're here, right?
[142:10.88]Yes.
[142:11.74]Okay, stay put.
[142:19.14]Uh-huh.
[142:22.59]Thank you.
[142:23.03]Thank you.
[142:23.35]I finally caught this criminal.
[142:25.91]What the?
[142:27.31]Quiet.
[142:28.49]As a thank you, I want to give you something.
[142:30.55]I hope you like it.
[142:31.15]I'll be going now.
[142:31.83]Thanks again.
[142:35.41]I got the spy watch.
[142:51.17]What the hell is this?
[143:05.97]Can I not?
[143:11.49]Should I sell this?
[143:14.51]What can I get for a spy watch?
[143:23.56]That was highly corrosive reactive and I fucked up.
[143:29.98]That was $8.00.
[143:35.05]I didn't even... I thought it was going to be a confirmation box.
[143:43.83]That's bad.
[143:51.18]Shit.
[143:51.72]Okay.
[143:52.40]How are you?
[143:52.84]I'm good.
[143:54.12]Yesterday when I was buying food at a Baxo restaurant, I met a producer and he likes my song.
[143:59.32]Today I'm going to visit his studio, but my smelly clothes, can you wash them?
[144:04.87]Alright, this guy's gonna end up getting a record deal and we're gonna get like 10 grand.
[144:07.31]Might as well have been nuclear waste.
[144:21.00]I should put this... I can put this toy in my room.
[144:23.68]Cool.
[144:25.08]That's so much cooler.
[144:26.02]Why did I sell the watch?
[144:31.16]I'm annoyed.
[144:42.10]Can you give the ring lady the robot?
[144:46.44]I can try.
[144:53.01]I can't.
[145:04.05]Open store.
[145:05.13]I want to do the quest first.
[145:09.29]I need to restock that shelf as well.
[145:14.59]Go back in that store.
[145:15.47]You can buy the watch back.
[145:17.45]Really?
[145:17.71]I don't see it.
[145:28.54]Are you sure?
[145:29.78]Alright, here you go.
[145:46.65]I bet you we get 500 bucks out of this.
[145:59.68]Sorry I lied to you.
[146:03.02]Well, you just found yourself a quick way to get timed out.
[146:04.98]What's going on, Daryl?
[146:10.77]Still on drugs?
[146:12.15]Yeah.
[146:13.98]Okay.
[146:15.64]On them right now.
[146:17.28]Yes.
[146:21.26]Hey, hey, Daryl.
[146:24.04]Me too.
[146:34.83]Who is this going to?
[146:35.59]Oh, yeah.
[146:45.09]Thank you so much.
[146:45.59]I hope I can get that DJ job with this fragrant clothing.
[146:49.11]Once again, thank you.
[146:50.01]Alright.
[146:50.39]Tomorrow we're going to get a massive payout.
[146:52.84]It's going to be awesome.
[146:56.38]Anything else that I missed down here?
[146:57.68]I still have to do that.
[147:02.18]Yeah, can't go that way.
[147:10.80]It's time to open this door.
[147:14.49]I'm ready to make massive, massive amounts.
[147:20.17]After restocking the shelf, of course.
[147:24.37]Price has changed as well.
[147:27.89]Alright, something big.
[147:31.81]Ooh, market price is different.
[147:34.49]Let's do 250.
[147:36.29]This is, that's messed up.
[147:43.38]It's fine.
[147:59.69]These shelves are all broken.
[148:03.58]GD's a friend.
[148:06.96]Alright, open.
[148:07.52]Officially open for business.
[148:19.43]Let all the stock run out on the detergent.
[148:23.28]That's a good way to do it.
[148:31.08]Lunch rush.
[148:40.75]Uh, I gotta de-lint that.
[148:49.37]Can you shit in the toilet?
[148:51.09]Uh... I don't... I don't know.
[148:53.58]Because there's been some weirdos that have come in.
[148:55.34]There's a guy that watches porn on your computer.
[148:57.08]I didn't know that was gonna happen in this game.
[149:25.61]Turn it up a little bit.
[149:26.83]It's a little low.
[149:34.08]I think I need more machines soon.
[149:35.86]$22?
[149:35.88]That was a lot.
[149:41.73]Damn.
[149:55.37]Just get rid of this shit.
[149:56.65]Fuck it.
[149:57.13]Throw the bleach into the street.
[149:58.33]I don't even care.
[150:00.40]No one's buying it.
[150:12.61]That guy bought the whole shelf?
[150:16.51]Ugh.
[150:30.98]What do you mean?
[150:40.81]That is such a great money maker, but I have to let it run out.
[150:47.75]It's fine, it's right here.
[150:51.92]A customer is stuck?
[150:55.22]Where?
[150:57.24]Where are you?
[150:59.46]What the fuck are you doing?
[151:00.88]How do I get you out?
[151:01.56]How do I get you out?
[151:02.46]What do I do?
[151:03.42]How do I get you out?
[151:06.29]Help customer.
[151:07.37]Please help me.
[151:08.15]Help customer with... Oh my god.
[151:23.59]What the fuck?
[151:25.31]A vandal is approaching.
[151:34.21]Does Daryl help with the vandals?
[151:35.65]What the fuck is going on in this game now?
[151:39.15]What's this person doing?
[151:54.08]This game keeps taking such an absurd, odd, the walls are being graffitied.
[152:00.85]What the fuck?
[152:02.21]What do I do?
[152:02.65]What do I have to do?
[152:06.84]This is a kid.
[152:07.54]I'm not going to hit the kid with a wrench.
[152:10.55]I'm going to call his fucking parents.
[152:11.97]I don't know his number.
[152:24.02]When someone graffitied on your laundry store, no one will come into your laundry store unless you clean the graffiti.
[152:28.91]Use the brush to clean the graffitis.
[152:30.81]You can also cancel this by hitting the NPC with a wrench.
[152:34.09]So you can hit the kid with a wrench.
[152:35.51]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[152:39.36]What the fuck happened in this game?
[152:56.49]Jesus.
[152:57.61]Okay.
[152:58.53]Machine is broken.
[152:59.85]Of course it is.
[153:02.49]Which one?
[153:04.36]I swear to God if somebody's fucking head is stuck in this.
[153:12.00]Do you remember PC Cafe Sim?
[153:13.70]The same shit happened.
[153:19.00]These games are always like... There's always something fucked up in these games.
[153:24.92]It's never just do laundry.
[153:36.57]Why are you singing that?
[153:37.83]There ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed Ain't nothing in this world for free Why are you singing that?
[153:58.49]I need to upgrade this guy to actually do something
[154:05.42]OK, all the stocks are clear.
[154:29.94]Good efficient.
[154:34.85]Did she steal something?
[154:35.77]No.
[154:39.44]Alright, somebody please buy this so I can restock it.
[154:54.49]This guy is seriously like an ape.
[154:57.97]I just picked this up.
[154:59.07]He's like a caveman.
[155:06.70]What about the deer?
[155:07.46]I don't have enough money to save the deer!
[155:09.42]Dude, don't you guys understand that ain't nothing in this world for free?
[155:37.88]Looks like the group chat was split on that one.
[155:42.77]I'm seeing a little bit of both of the pluses and the minuses.
[155:55.21]Level up.
[156:09.29]Alright, I am hiring somebody to do this laundry.
[156:14.51]And I'm just going to sit around and just watch stuff.
[156:17.43]And give supplemental encouragement.
[156:35.79]There's only occasional rest for the wicked.
[156:40.74]That song wouldn't hit as hard now.
[156:41.96]Alright, everything is cli- No, this one's still fucked up.
[156:46.34]Uh... I- I need to restock this though.
[156:51.18]Can I put the bleach on the top shelf?
[156:55.48]There we go.
[156:59.60]Two se- That could be making three dollars per can.
[157:14.85]Let me check the coins.
[157:22.97]Nice.
[157:31.01]I mean, you're getting your workout in.
[157:33.65]Two minutes straight of squats.
[157:35.97]I feel it.
[157:36.41]I get it.
[157:38.05]Just trying to get your steps in.
[157:54.65]You like board games?
[157:56.13]Um, I do.
[157:56.69]I play them occasionally.
[158:01.18]I'm not a big board game fan.
[158:06.94]But I enjoy playing them sometimes.
[158:12.36]I gotta upgrade some shit.
[158:13.56]I'm still getting $5 per load.
[158:17.06]That's dog shit.
[158:18.60]That's not good.
[158:20.66]That is genuinely awful.
[158:23.38]The coin-operated machines are making me more money.
[158:37.64]I'm charging way more for this.
[158:53.76]Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, D&D.
[158:57.88]I've played... Actually, a board game I really like is... Etalyx showed it to me.
[159:05.44]I think it's called For Sale.
[159:08.35]And you get coins and you buy and sell houses and stuff with coins.
[159:13.91]It's pretty fun.
[159:19.27]It's very simple, too.
[159:26.66]Mousetrap is fun to try to put it together.
[159:28.42]Nice job, Daryl.
[159:34.03]Excellent work picking that up and putting it down.
[159:36.25]Excellent job.
[159:37.95]We're going to be raising our prices.
[159:48.42]Okay.
[159:50.64]It's time to raise prices.
[159:56.25]How do I do that?
[160:04.57]Okay.
[160:05.21]Medium.
[160:05.97]It's two pieces of clothing slows down movement speed when being held.
[160:09.24]I can do big baskets.
[160:14.88]More of an ironing table, folding table.
[160:26.94]What's what's the play here?
[160:31.82]Get the cheapest upgrades.
[160:35.84]These still are doing it dirty table.
[160:46.59]More ironing ironing table.
[160:48.59]That's a big tip.
[160:50.62]OK, let's get the ironing table increase.
[160:56.80]It's 50 more cents per load.
[161:00.46]And I need to buy a better detergent.
[161:09.71]Now I need to restock.
[161:15.11]Yeah.
[161:16.49]How much of a shelf upgrade?
[161:17.97]No.
[161:18.09]Alright.
[161:19.90]That's fine.
[161:24.87]Coin laundry, top room, big room, utility room.
[161:30.97]What do you do in the big room?
[161:40.08]So how much better is this?
[161:48.82]Palm plant is 16.
[161:49.96]I need five of them.
[161:59.37]That's good.
[161:59.95]Let's restock the bottom shelf.
[162:01.15]I already had one back here.
[162:07.62]What?
[162:09.94]Alright, isn't one of the quests happening tomorrow?
[162:11.82]Something's happening tomorrow.
[162:12.68]What is it?
[162:29.31]Price is going to change tomorrow anyways.

[168:21.37]No, I'm good.
[168:28.20]I still, I genuinely am enjoying this weird game.

[168:36.94]What the plan is.
[168:41.91]I want another employee.
[168:46.81]I got so much junk.
[168:47.77]Get rid of it.

[170:06.16]What I mean is somebody puking.
[170:14.48]Why they keep adding new special infected?
[170:16.82]I don't see a vomiter.
[170:27.33]He's in the bathroom?
[170:28.07]Alright, on this next break, I'm going to figure out if I want to keep going with this for a little bit or if I want to go to Chrono Trigger.
[170:54.50]I'm probably going to keep playing this game.
[171:07.78]Clean up your floor.
[171:08.60]It's disgusting.
[171:09.74]Why am I doing this?
[171:10.62]Alright.

[176:25.69]Okay.
[176:26.97]I've made my decision.
[176:29.85]My decision is I'll be playing Laundry Simulator for another hour.
[176:40.61]And then after this next hour, I'll be moving to Chrono Trigger for the remainder of the evening.
[176:54.95]And I will play Chrono Trigger for, at minimum, two hours.
[177:02.34]I really want to keep going on that.
[177:09.94]So, Chrono Trigger is going to be pretty late.
[177:13.29]It's going to be late night for that one.
[177:14.73]Okay.
[177:22.02]Let's go.
[177:32.96]So what was I doing?
[177:33.80]I vomit alert.
[177:38.18]Where?
[177:40.66]What?
[177:42.78]Toilet needs to be cleaned.
[177:43.84]A customer stuck in the toilet.
[177:46.68]What the fuck did you do?
[177:48.06]Oh God.
[177:51.46]Get out of here.
[177:58.90]I'm not.
[177:59.94]I'm not fucking pressing two guys.
[178:05.25]That ain't fucking happening.
[178:12.52]Um... Hold on.
[178:15.14]I've got... This puke all over the bathroom.
[178:22.87]I don't know what to do.
[178:23.57]Hold on.
[178:23.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:24.73]I need to... Turn this fucking music off.
[178:29.92]I don't...
[178:36.41]Okay, now I can think.
[178:45.00]No clean clothes?
[178:45.90]Oh, there you go.
[178:48.22]Cue that up.
[178:50.07]Alright.
[178:51.37]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[178:53.43]I gotta clean the bathroom.
[179:01.94]Okay, bathroom.
[179:04.00]Bathroom.
[179:08.23]Okay.
[179:08.33]Dude.
[179:47.67]He puked into my flowers.
[179:49.79]OK, that's good.
[180:02.82]Now I can just sit here and we can do the folding.
[180:06.36]That's fine.
[180:07.08]I can restock that in a minute.
[180:16.98]Looking good.
[180:20.63]Alright, good.
[180:22.01]I need to hire another person.
[180:23.19]When do I get to complete the challenge?
[180:28.07]Serve 60 customers on manual line.
[180:30.41]Wait, have I not been doing that?
[180:42.21]I've not been doing that because it's not me doing it.
[180:45.17]So I need to tell them not to work.
[180:50.86]I just started counting now, OK?
[181:08.73]I gotta teach this guy.
[181:09.67]Hold on, I think I can do it now.
[181:15.95]Okay.
[181:16.55]Upgrade the lint roller.
[181:18.73]Unlock mini mart.
[181:20.37]1100.
[181:20.53]That sucks.
[181:32.74]All the coins.
[181:34.74]Good.
[181:43.53]Get his stuff.
[181:44.17]Good.
[181:53.09]I could see how you could get addicted to this game because it's just.
[181:58.07]Eventually you could have a huge laundromat.
[182:04.31]All these simulator games that just they're just the same like.
[182:08.68]Do this task a bunch of times and upgrade, but I'm such a sucker for that shit.
[182:13.32]I really am.
[182:26.03]I don't even know what that's getting me.
[182:33.84]Okay, let me... What do you want?
[182:35.95]I can't even get you that yet.
[182:36.95]I need to get you... Wait, you have a new mission.
[182:41.29]No, you don't.
[182:41.71]Okay, I need to get Antique.
[182:43.48]Something Antique.
[182:57.48]I'll do these and then I'll go get it.
[183:19.43]Yeah, Chrono Trigger will start in exactly 40 to 50 minutes from now.
[183:26.88]And then I'm going to make a tea and we're going to chill and I'm going to play through probably the... I think the castle is coming up next.
[183:34.04]If I remember.
[183:35.96]Wait, I got to lint roll this.
[183:49.15]Don't pick that one up.
[183:56.72]Okay, that's almost depleted.
[184:08.26]What tea are you going to fuck with tonight?
[184:10.45]Maybe a rooibos.
[184:14.77]Either a rooibos or maybe green.
[184:16.67]A little bit of caffeine.
[184:19.31]Keep me going into the night.
[184:39.93]That's it for today.
[184:40.65]Good.
[184:49.75]I'm on a rotation of... And it switches.
[184:54.73]I introduced turmeric into the equation.
[184:59.87]Turmeric and... What the fuck else is in it?
[185:05.34]Like turmeric, honey, cinnamon, I think.
[185:11.65]A little bit of ginger.
[185:16.01]It's good.
[185:16.29]I like it.
[185:17.89]But I do green.
[185:18.81]I'm on the kick of peppermint, though.
[185:21.23]Peppermint tea is just... Like I told you, that's the only shit that's keeping me alive is peppermint tea at this point.
[185:35.12]Okay, is that the last one?
[185:38.15]We, oh, no.
[185:39.87]Do you have, do we have one for you?
[185:42.32]Wait, don't give it to him.
[185:43.60]Daryl, do not give, do not, Daryl, do not.
[185:45.96]Daryl, do not.
[185:47.10]Daryl, do not.
[185:47.78]Daryl!
[185:52.17]You're lucky.
[186:06.36]Are you into crystals as well, hippie?
[186:12.38]I mean, the smoky quartz and a black tourmaline will be able to ground your energy levels, especially if you wear it on your wrist.
[186:29.61]Wait, coins.
[186:40.19]Notice how that's the only thing I can say because that's the only one that I actually own.
[186:46.74]And I bought it years ago and everybody made fun of me.
[186:49.48]I just thought it was cool looking.
[186:52.52]I thought it was cool looking and everyone's like, oh, it's Crystal.
[186:55.78]What is that?
[186:56.16]Is that a jerk off Crystal?
[186:57.60]Oh, dude, he probably charges it by jerking off into it or whatever.
[187:00.74]And it's like, dude, I know.
[187:02.04]I just thought it was cool looking.
[187:05.32]You guys got your mind on the gutter.
[187:07.24]This is a gutter of mind.
[187:08.58]Alright, let's close it.
[187:17.71]Wait, hold on.
[187:18.53]Hmm.
[187:23.85]More tips.
[187:32.56]Who said that?
[187:35.29]That was meme shit from 2017 or something.
[187:46.50]Everybody freeze-framed a video.
[187:48.52]I used to do a lot of, you know, obviously on camera and face cam stuff.
[187:52.46]And I'm on video.
[187:53.64]And people see that I have this black bracelet on.
[187:56.37]And they're like, what is that?
[187:57.31]Why do you wear that?
[187:58.61]And I'm like, I don't know.
[188:00.27]I just do.
[188:00.67]What do you think it has, magic powers?
[188:04.56]No, I don't think it has magic powers.
[188:06.02]Why are you wearing it?
[188:06.50]I think it's cool.
[188:08.10]Why do you think it's cool?
[188:09.42]Because it gives you magic powers?
[188:11.58]No!
[188:12.64]You jerked off on that, didn't you?
[188:14.26]No!
[188:15.14]You jerk off, don't you?
[188:16.56]No!
[188:18.60]What?
[188:19.52]No!
[188:20.28]Yeah, you do.
[188:22.12]What the fuck?
[188:26.90]I've recycled the same joke.
[188:27.88]I did.
[188:28.56]I did.
[188:28.80]Yeah.
[188:30.06]It was a little different.
[188:31.10]It's a callback.
[188:37.16]Sometimes you gotta call them back, right?
[188:39.70]I want this not in the bathroom.
[188:46.92]Old material.
[188:48.00]No, I'm making a direct reference to the old material because that old material is still relevant because people will still say that.
[188:56.28]So it's not old material.
[188:57.88]It is still relevant today.
[189:02.18]I gotta close this door.
[189:14.04]That's the toothbrush bit.
[189:15.02]Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[189:16.60]You literally made up the bracelet bit.
[189:20.67]No, I didn't.
[189:22.47]I have the bracelet literally on right now.
[189:25.23]Do you hear?
[189:27.99]Do you hear this?
[189:31.31]That's my bracelet.
[189:38.51]I don't have it on.
[189:39.15]That was the cap of a water bottle.
[189:41.27]I'm sorry I lied to you.
[189:50.02]I got nine bucks.
[189:52.38]Ready to open the store.
[189:54.50]Should be making more money.
[189:55.42]Anybody else out here besides these?
[189:56.88]Okay, you, I still, I gotta get something antique.
[190:02.75]Shit, I forgot about the plants.
[190:06.05]Alright, I'm, that is priority number one.
[190:22.32]What do you got for bracelets?
[190:23.08]I got one bracelet.
[190:24.30]It's black tourmaline.
[190:26.80]It looked cool.
[190:28.96]That's why I got it.
[190:40.64]No other reason.
[190:52.02]Are you a watch guy?
[190:53.04]You know, it's funny you say that because I actually was looking at... Watches are crazy.
[190:59.21]There are certain watches that I was going through and finding different... Oh, this company, this company.
[191:05.73]There are watch companies where you need to like contact a guy to personally talk about the watch.
[191:13.54]It's not like, oh yeah, I'll order that.
[191:15.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[191:15.76]I have to have a personal meeting with you.
[191:17.80]And we need to talk about that watch.
[191:20.44]And it's probably like $80,000.
[191:37.22]What's the company?
[191:38.89]Is it Swatch?
[191:40.33]Is Swatch the right company?
[191:42.89]They do the interesting... They did a Simpsons series of watches.
[191:47.95]They were pretty cool.
[191:50.66]They weren't too expensive or anything.
[191:52.44]It was like $80, $50, $100, I think.
[191:55.62]I think watches are cool, but I don't...
[192:04.91]They're kind of... I don't know.
[192:06.69]I'm not like an accessory guy.
[192:07.95]I'm not the kind of guy that wears like a gold chain and a watch and a... No, I'm just kind of... I don't know.
[192:26.73]I don't like having shit on me.
[192:29.68]I don't know.
[192:30.00]I'm a weirdo.
[192:31.00]So when I'm laying around and if I have like a chain on, it's like this thing's fucking strangling me.
[192:38.15]Or a watch.
[192:38.71]It's just I don't like it.
[192:39.81]I don't know.
[192:40.41]I don't like it on.
[192:58.36]Yeah, guys, my wardrobe is gray t-shirts and black jeans.

[193:11.75]I have like some Lucky Brand jeans.
[193:16.19]They're nice.
[193:16.65]They're good, I guess.

[194:24.93]I VIP'd that person for like an hour.
[194:29.98]I'm not even kidding.
[194:30.50]VIP that person for like at least 10 minutes and then take it away.
[194:38.62]They have a thing that says lucky you in the zipper.

[202:56.74]I don't think so.
[203:03.06]I'll fix them.
[203:07.98]How did that...
[203:18.17]You brought it up?
[203:20.17]No, somebody in chat brought up the crystal thing and then I elevated it and then you elevated it and then I elevated it and now I'm saying I'm putting a stop to it.

[204:15.10]I was bringing up... Why did I bring up the crystals?
[204:16.84]Why did I bring up the crystals?
[204:19.80]Somebody said something about it.
[204:22.60]It was unprompted.
[204:23.34]No, it was definitely, it was prompted.
[204:28.20]Who brought that up?

[206:11.42]This person said,
[206:20.11]You used to be such a nice, sweet guy.
[206:21.57]When did you get so raunchy?
[206:23.31]Makes me regret showing you to my nieces and nephews.
[206:27.29]What are your nieces and nephews doing awake at like 2 o'clock in the morning?
[206:35.29]These plants are huge.
[206:36.67]What the...
[206:49.71]These things are gigantic.
[206:58.97]Hey, this is a mature audience stream.
[207:00.53]I'm probably one of the only people on Twitch that for a decade had the, this is a mature audience stream.
[207:09.10]Probably to the detriment of the channel, by the way, early on.
[207:19.59]What are you going to do with all this?
[207:27.63]Thank you.
[207:28.17]Okay.
[207:29.53]Hopefully he'll be well soon so we can go back to and go to Santa's home.
[207:33.61]It's getting late.
[207:34.07]I guess we need to go home for now.
[207:35.03]See you tomorrow.
[207:35.71]Alright.
[207:36.15]We need to see the culmination of this.
[207:59.16]You're a real swell guy.
[208:03.79]Thanks for all the help you've given me over the years.
[208:11.27]Alright, let's see what happens.
[208:16.77]Tasks are now available.
[208:17.83]You can get rewards if you finish them on time.
[208:20.81]New task.
[208:26.04]Dry 32 laundry clean for fur.
[208:28.64]Okay.
[208:30.67]I'm saving this.
[208:33.05]Alright, where are those kids?
[208:35.57]What do they do?
[208:40.72]Okay.
[208:44.68]What's the deal?
[208:50.41]Help, the reindeer's gone.
[208:52.17]We need to find him as soon as possible or else Santa will be doomed.
[208:55.55]He's probably in his home inside the forest, not gone.
[208:59.61]No, please help us.
[209:07.73]Boys, I'm sorry to say this to you.
[209:11.93]And I know you don't know this because you're video game characters and you're not real.
[209:16.90]I'm so sorry to report to you that the game is only one street long.
[209:25.92]There is no magical forest.
[209:28.02]There's no magical reindeer.
[209:31.09]The whole game is this 300-yard street.
[209:38.80]It saddens me to say.
[209:43.25]But I will go try to find your reindeer.
[209:47.03]He's right here.
[209:51.37]Thanks for taking care of my sweet reindeer.
[209:53.27]Ho, ho, ho.
[210:01.68]Hey.
[210:02.98]Hey, kids.
[210:04.94]Guess what I found.
[210:06.73]I swear to God I didn't write this letter myself.
[210:11.18]Here it is.
[210:11.70]See, I told you he has an owner come.
[210:15.14]We also need to go home.
[210:20.23]What?
[210:24.77]It was real.
[210:32.84]Santa, thanks for taking care of my sweet reindeer.
[210:36.27]Ho, ho, ho.
[210:37.29]Here's a present for all of you.
[210:39.74]Ho, ho, ho.
[210:41.10]Happy holidays.
[211:00.37]See, I told you Santa Claus.
[211:01.52]This game is fucking weird.
[211:04.00]Yeah, he is.
[211:04.72]Well, anyway, let's get back home.
[211:05.80]Bye bye.
[211:06.26]I got a snow globe.
[211:13.44]Oh.
[211:17.66]Cute.
[211:24.21]I'm kidding.
[211:24.73]I'm kidding.
[211:25.07]I'm kidding.
[211:25.41]I'm not going to throw it away.
[211:38.63]Wow.
[211:42.51]It's beautiful.
[211:43.31]Okay, I need to buy an antique for her.
[212:02.75]That was fake as fuck.
[212:09.83]What do you mean?
[212:10.35]What?
[212:10.67]My reaction?
[212:22.59]My girlfriend drank glow stick goo as a kid.
[212:25.02]That's not good.
[212:29.30]Okay, I need to buy something that's an antique, right?
[212:39.27]Does any of this count?
[212:44.09]A ceiling speaker?
[212:45.49]Because this plays music?
[212:46.75]Okay, no.
[212:50.01]What should I buy?
[212:53.92]Washboard?
[212:54.60]Would this be it?
[213:00.12]Get her a plastic chair.
[213:04.38]I also want a speaker.
[213:08.23]Alright, we'll give her the plastic chair.
[213:30.79]It doesn't even play music.
[213:33.41]It's just a fire alarm.
[213:40.77]You don't even want this.
[213:41.67]Oh, okay.
[213:57.09]I don't, I guess that's not, that doesn't count.
[214:04.77]close wall vector this is that is cool right that is a laundry mat interesting item maybe she'll want this yeah look this is cool no
[214:33.77]Missing woman.
[214:43.27]Get an old crappy washer and give that to her.
[214:46.53]I tried to give her a washer before.
[214:47.75]She didn't want it.
[215:03.49]She doesn't want any of this stuff.
[215:09.47]I don't get it.
[215:09.83]Alright, I think we're going to be able to do one more day here.
[215:23.80]And then we will move to Chrono Trigger for an hour or two.
[215:29.66]What's up the alley across the street?
[215:31.38]That's true.
[215:32.56]This is a weird alley.
[215:36.90]Nope, never mind.
[215:46.35]Remember the old coin machine one?
[215:55.37]I need inventory.
[215:56.97]Ah, shit.
[216:01.79]Will she take this?
[216:15.17]No, she won't.
[216:30.54]What was the point of that speaker?
[216:54.55]Take the fire escape?
[217:03.34]Where?
[217:16.14]Can't get up there.
[217:18.57]There's a ladder right there.
[217:23.09]How do I get back there?
[217:37.54]Oh shit, it's a direct off guy.
[217:40.54]You know what?
[217:40.90]I don't even care.
[218:11.87]Get out of here.
[218:22.39]Don't ever come back here again.
[218:24.97]You fucking pervert.
[218:32.20]God.
[218:33.58]Ridiculous.
[218:42.57]Just out of curiosity, what was he watching?
[219:10.94]This game makes a few very strange assumptions.
[219:13.79]Like, first of all... No one's allowed back here.
[219:21.77]At all.
[219:23.52]So... What... No one can go back there anyways.
[219:37.46]So he's breaking two... he's doing two major problems.
[219:44.61]You're already trespassing and you don't have clothes on and you're using a computer without my permission and everyone's in the... we're all here.
[219:51.67]There's a lot of layers to why that doesn't make any sense.
[220:07.05]Hey man, what can I say?
[220:07.89]Gas, gas, gas, gas.
[220:08.98]True.
[220:39.61]Deadly nerve agent.
[220:43.83]I feel so... We talked about it already, but man, oh man.
[220:49.57]I feel so validated.
[220:55.88]No spoilers in the chat or anything, but man, oh man.
[221:04.36]If you know, you know.
[221:05.58]And when I saw it, I was like, no, you gotta be kidding me.
[221:46.79]need to prove it show us all of no was the movie good as a whole I I liked it all those movies are just they're kind of just popcorn bubble gum kind of movies you just like eat candy eat popcorn and just like watch the mayhem
[222:13.65]I don't think they're going to win any Academy Awards.
[222:16.59]And did I hear that they're actually, are they doing another one?
[222:27.05]They kind of just can't help themselves at this point.
[222:28.75]Is that guy?
[222:29.49]Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:30.71]This is a bad guy, right?
[222:36.94]Oh, this one in the fucking trash.
[222:50.34]It recently got canceled.
[222:51.34]Oh.
[223:14.64]Slippery floor?
[223:16.30]Where?
[223:19.06]Oh, just kind of falling apart right now.
[223:21.58]Where is the slippery floor?
[223:48.17]Alright, star's closing.
[223:50.97]And that's probably going to be the end of this.
[223:57.09]I enjoyed my time with it.
[224:00.06]It was fucked up.
[224:02.08]But, hey, it was a good avenue to just talk and chill and it's fun.
[224:05.04]And, you know, that's all these games need to be, right?
[224:06.98]Who cares?
[224:10.70]I do wonder what the late game of this actually is.
[224:17.19]It's probably crazy.
[224:22.94]Judging by the fact that there's like eight rooms to unlock.
[224:32.12]Power washer sim 2 just got announced.
[224:34.48]Heard about that.
[224:36.08]What he's asking about it.
[224:54.76]Yeah, I'll be switching to Chrono Trigger in about five minutes or so.
[224:59.62]At the end of this day.
[225:12.05]What about Drug Dealer Sim 2?
[225:18.24]Yeah, man, I still look at the recommended channel.
[225:22.54]in the Discord I know the Discord has gone into a kind of a broadcast only Discord but I still peek at the recommended all the time and by all the time I mean that let me rephrase that like once a month I will scroll through I just want to make sure I make that clear
[225:51.89]There's a creepy guy outside?
[225:53.27]Did you see that?
[226:06.31]Okay, the same exact thing happened with the kid.
[226:24.37]Okay, we're closed.
[226:25.71]Get out.
[226:26.49]Everybody out.
[226:39.35]You should just wrench everybody because you're about to leave anyways.
[226:41.53]I don't think you can.
[226:59.33]Almost at the rank two.
[227:06.64]I might even play this game off stream one day just to get all the way through.
[227:10.60]Maybe not.
[227:17.20]I'm curious if the lady's out there again.
[227:28.94]I don't see her.
[227:32.19]Come back to it.
[227:33.37]It'll be available.
[227:34.21]I know that here's the thing.
[227:35.41]Those of you that might be new to the channel.
[227:39.53]There is a period of about two weeks where if a game does not show itself again in two weeks or within even, I'd say, a few days, it will never be shown again.
[227:55.63]It's really a one week within six to seven days.
[227:58.89]If you don't see it again, it's gone.
[228:10.82]Yep.
[228:11.80]It's unfortunate.
[228:17.34]I did think about playing Infinity Nikki tonight, though.
[228:20.28]I was thinking about it.
[228:22.61]So that could be resurrected.
[228:27.16]I didn't even know there was a light switch.
[228:34.86]Alright.
[228:35.94]That's it for this.
[228:36.88]Make sure it's saved in case it does show up again, which it might.
[228:41.54]What about Dracula?
[228:42.22]Well, Dracula is going to be shown.
[228:45.52]I haven't opened Dracula 3 yet, so the cooldown period, that's fine.
[228:50.34]There is no push on that because I haven't even shown it yet.
[228:57.01]We're going to move to Chrono Trigger.
[228:58.19]I'm going to take a little bit of a longer break.
[229:01.75]I just want to make sure that Auto's doing good and check on everything, see how things are going.
[229:11.48]So maybe like five minutes.
[229:15.16]When I come back, we will play Chrono Trigger.
[229:19.17]What about Hylics?
[229:19.83]I played Hylics 1.
[229:20.65]It was good.
[229:24.87]That's a good chill night stream.
[229:27.43]How long is Hylics 2?
[229:29.15]What's the time to beat on it on a casual playthrough?
[229:32.45]Because the first one was pretty short.
[229:33.47]I did it in one stream, right?
[229:41.74]It's pretty short.
[229:42.30]It's probably longer than the first one, though.
[229:49.02]It's surprisingly difficult.
[229:52.30]It's under 12, under 10 hours.
[229:56.59]So I could do it in probably two streams.
[230:00.18]It's about eight hours.
[230:02.30]If it's eight hours, that means it's going to be at least 10.
[230:04.58]You got the yap factor needs to be put in there.
[230:17.29]Alright, I'll be back.
[230:19.87]Ads are going to kick on here in about a minute.
[230:22.49]And when I come back, you will see Chrono Trigger and we'll continue the playthrough.
[230:26.50]If you're sticking around, see you in a little bit.
[230:28.72]If not, then it is getting kind of late, so I understand.
[230:32.36]We'll see you again.
[230:34.22]Be back.
