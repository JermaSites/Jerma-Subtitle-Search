[00:01.92]There we go.
[00:06.45]Hi.
[00:08.83]Good to see you.
[00:15.43]Hope you're having a good day.
[00:16.68]How are you?
[00:20.74]Shh, I was sleeping.
[00:23.50]Well, wake up.
[00:27.58]What time is it?
[00:33.24]God is here.
[00:36.09]I am not God.
[00:37.79]That's not... No.
[00:39.95]You guys remember Bruce Almighty?
[00:46.15]When he sits down to the prayer email thing?
[00:52.60]And he presses yes to everybody?
[00:58.70]I couldn't do it.
[01:07.09]I love that movie.
[01:08.49]That's a good movie.
[01:13.01]You need to grant my wish.
[01:18.61]What if I did a genie stream?
[01:22.43]Where I was a genie, and I was granting wishes to people.
[01:32.06]I feel like... I don't know if that would work.
[01:39.61]You would dare ignore my prayers?
[01:43.58]How's your day going?
[01:44.30]It's going well.
[01:46.02]It's going really well.
[01:53.38]I feel like the only thing I would be able to do... No, this wouldn't work.
[01:58.51]Because we would have to have people kind of pre-screen their genie wishes.
[02:03.49]Because, I mean, realistically...
[02:05.91]Genie, can I have some money?
[02:09.41]Yes, absolutely!
[02:10.49]I could give you money.
[02:12.65]That's the extent of what I can do.
[02:14.65]I can't really do anything else.
[02:16.73]Genie, I really need my driveway paved.
[02:20.55]I guess I could try.
[02:21.61]What else would I be able to do?
[02:24.45]I wouldn't be able to do anything else.
[02:30.47]Like, I guess you could wish for someone to power wash your driveway, and I would come do it.
[02:36.07]I don't think this idea doesn't work.
[02:50.08]You have to interpret the wishes like a genie does.
[02:55.11]Okay, so how I would interpret that one... Yeah, it's a service that you're paying for.
[03:26.13]It's on Groupon.
[03:34.54]So you being a genie means you just become a contract labor worker.
[03:39.16]I mean, what else would you do?
[03:42.42]Oh, great and powerful genie, I wish for you to go down a hill, a big hill in the neighborhood on a sled.
[03:51.84]Okay, I could probably do that, right?
[03:54.30]But I couldn't do much else.
[03:57.93]You could wish for me to... Oh, great and powerful genie, I wish for you to go to David Buster's and have a fun two-hour evening.
[04:05.61]I guess I could do that.
[04:06.97]There's not much I can really do.
[04:13.68]What are these wishes?
[04:14.60]I'm just saying, I wouldn't be able to fix very many things.
[04:20.69]You know, it's like, oh, I wish for this, I wish for that.
[04:22.59]Oh, Joe, great, you wouldn't be able to wish for, like, world peace or anything with me.
[04:27.24]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[04:28.18]I'm not a genie.
[04:33.00]You can wish for me to, like, power wash a driveway for, like, the stream would be kind of fun, but I don't, I couldn't, I don't think I could do anything else.
[04:44.91]Fake, selfish genie.
[04:47.37]I...
[04:50.29]No, I just don't... I wouldn't be able to.
[04:52.33]Okay.
[05:00.37]I wish for emote-only mode.
[05:02.16]Yeah, I could do that.
[05:09.06]Oh, great powerful genie, I wish for you to end the stream.
[05:14.08]These could be kind of fun.
[05:15.67]But that's not really... I mean, this could be fun for like 10 minutes, not for like 3 hours.
[05:21.74]Anyways, here's the plan.
[05:23.72]We are going to be playing House Flipper.
[05:27.84]Their pets update came out.
[05:29.12]I want to check it out for a little bit.
[05:32.84]There's also the possibility to play MultiVersus.
[05:36.18]I got access to the alpha.
[05:38.56]If I want to play that for a little bit, I can.
[05:40.84]Maybe I just play House Flipper and we'll play MultiVersus soon because I think the alpha is permanent.
[05:55.99]Yeah.
[05:57.84]The alpha ends in two days.
[06:00.38]Well, yeah, whatever.
[06:01.14]I'll figure it out.
[06:04.08]Alpha ends in two hours.
[06:05.56]No, it doesn't.
[06:07.98]Wait, does the alpha actually end in two days?
[06:12.75]When does the alpha end on Friday?
[06:16.77]It ends in two hours.
[06:17.77]No, it doesn't.
[06:18.39]Shut up.
[06:19.21]It does not end in two hours.
[06:23.86]It's still the 20th.
[06:24.50]Alright, somebody just had a helpful message and it got eaten by the auto-mod.
[06:28.66]It's on the... Okay, the 27th.
[06:30.84]When on the 27th?
[06:35.44]Why does your microphone sound so weird today?
[06:37.16]I covered it in Vaseline and covered it in oils and olive oil and stuff.
[06:41.39]I was trying to get a nice smoother sound.
[06:43.23]I don't think it worked.
[06:52.72]Automod removes all helpful messages.
[06:56.30]May 27th at 5pm Pacific.
[06:58.28]Alright.
[06:59.72]So if I don't play it today, then on Friday I'll play it for like 40 minutes.
[07:03.92]So that's fine.
[07:14.43]It's gonna be a good stream.
[07:15.79]I'll play it for like 40 minutes, whatever.
[07:17.25]I don't think you guys...
[07:22.07]Nothing helpful is auto-modded?
[07:23.94]That's alright.
[07:26.90]Yeah, we'll play Multiversus on Friday for an hour and a half.
[07:32.14]Maybe an hour, maybe 30 minutes.
[07:35.66]Or I'll play it tonight.
[07:37.21]If I feel like it.
[07:39.37]It does look kind of cool, though.
[07:47.21]May 27th, yeah.
[07:50.83]Can you do a Street Fighter KO combo?
[07:54.44]It seems like the game plays identically to Smash Bros.
[07:57.60]with one kind of major change.
[08:01.20]And it's more team-based, right?
[08:03.86]You have team recovery moves and stuff, isn't it?
[08:07.92]Otherwise, it's essentially very much the same game, isn't it?
[08:12.00]It isn't.
[08:14.03]It's balanced around 2v2.
[08:17.17]Oh, okay.
[08:18.05]I knew that they were... No, it's not even close.
[08:19.63]There's no shields.
[08:22.44]Okay.
[08:27.36]Multiverses is going to be free to play.
[08:29.65]Oh, that's fine.
[08:35.05]Drupal, please wish my best friend, my silly fluffball, a happy birthday for the 27th.
[08:40.59]Please, they are your biggest fan.
[08:42.25]That it's all they want for their birthday.
[08:44.97]Happy birthday, silly fluffball!
[08:49.05]It's me, Drupal.85!
[09:00.40]Steel's birthday, man.
[09:04.27]It's my birthday, too.
[09:05.03]Happy birthday to everybody's birthday.
[09:06.31]I can't do them all.
[09:10.45]Here, if you have a birthday within the next three to six business months, happy birthday to all those May birthdays.
[09:17.60]Happy birthday to all those June birthdays.
[09:19.48]Happy birthday to all those July and August and September and Donner and Vixen.
[09:26.46]And then we're going to wrap back around and take that at the White House.
[09:30.60]Yeah!
[09:32.94]There.
[09:39.76]Did I cover it all?
[09:45.18]That's an old meme.
[09:46.44]Do any of you know what that is?
[09:47.88]Chat's way too young to know what that is.
[09:51.57]You kind of are.
[09:52.21]Maybe you are.
[09:53.03]You are way... That's way too young for... Yeah.
[09:57.69]Does anybody in the chat know who Howard Dean is?
[10:04.61]You have to, right?
[10:08.15]Who?
[10:09.71]Whatever.
[10:18.10]Is that the funny scream guy?
[10:20.24]He didn't even, alright, he went like, yeah!
[10:24.00]Everybody fucking freaked out, like what?
[10:27.92]No, really think about that.
[10:32.28]He became this meme joke guy because he literally said, We're gonna go to Michigan and Oregon and I'm doing a pump-up speech and we're gonna go and we're gonna win next time.
[10:44.13]Yeah!
[10:46.09]This guy's a fucking looney tune.
[10:48.03]This guy's fucked up.
[10:50.39]Huh?
[10:56.87]All he did was, like, cheer.
[11:00.69]It was absurd.
[11:01.87]What am I turning into here?
[11:05.24]My mic.
[11:09.10]I know my mic's fucked up right now, but I haven't had time to sit down and fix it.
[11:14.56]Compressor Andy.
[11:18.66]Are you, like, 40 years old or something?
[11:20.62]No, not yet.
[11:32.60]well you guys you know something you know something so what let me hold on I haven't heard this in a long one year you know something

[11:51.43]We're going to California and Texas and New York.
[11:54.60]We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.
[11:59.42]And then we're going to Washington, D.C.
[12:01.02]to take back the White House.
[12:02.96]Yeah!
[12:06.09]Was that that bad?
[12:12.90]What, because he has a really great WWE promotion voice?
[12:18.42]He was just yelling.
[12:25.20]What, is that a big of a deal?
[12:28.40]Boomer humor.
[12:29.30]Alright, fine.
[12:30.21]We'll get to the zoomer humor.
[12:31.81]We'll get to the zoomer humor.
[12:32.87]Here we go.
[12:35.17]Hi, guys.
[12:35.53]Hi.
[12:39.43]Hi.

[12:58.37]Here's my computer.
[13:00.37]Okay.
[13:00.97]So, I have to do, like, the Pets tutorial DLC.
[13:03.84]Okay.
[13:08.58]Because I can't touch this yet.
[13:11.93]I also have... Alright, I remember this is the house that me and Ludwig, when we competed.
[13:17.65]So I can sell a lot of this stuff.
[13:20.95]I can just sell all this and just get a bunch of money.
[13:23.85]Are there new pet houses?
[13:27.90]I don't see any new pet houses.
[13:29.34]I thought there were more houses.
[13:31.10]Do I have to unlock them?
[13:31.90]I think I have to unlock them.
[13:38.05]It's easy money.
[13:38.95]Oh, okay.
[13:40.19]Alright, so let's just go.
[13:40.97]Let's do, this is pet, House of Pets.
[13:43.60]Can you guys hear it?
[13:44.14]Is it too low?
[13:45.78]I can't even hear it.
[13:49.22]Okay, I thought that was, I thought that was animals.
[13:50.66]I was like, what is going, what, what?
[13:55.00]This is like one of those children's play mats.
[13:59.68]Where am I?
[14:02.36]The train didn't make any sounds.
[14:03.59]Alright.
[14:05.67]Alice Finbar always wanted to see the world.
[14:07.19]After graduating from university, she decided to satisfy one of us.
[14:09.28]Three years later, while on a remote trip, she found a hungry and sick bunny.
[14:11.54]He eventually became her travel mate.
[14:13.60]Alice has bought her first house recently.
[14:15.66]She wants to move in with Jesper the bunny as soon as possible.
[14:18.97]Settling down will be something new for both of them.
[14:20.97]This is freaking me out.
[14:24.49]This is freaking me out.
[14:25.69]I don't know why.
[14:26.23]Okay, so we have to take care of the bunny rabbit.
[14:29.34]So what do we have to do?
[14:36.11]Am I high right now?
[14:37.19]No.
[14:37.25]Voice acting.
[14:43.15]sled in Alaska but house renovation is not really my thing it's funny I've heard you can do wonders and I want my home to be one right now it's in a worse state than machu picchu what's that something more than just my base camp what's that a place I can work from live in rest how many animals are in this house wait there's like welcoming tracks for me and my bunny
[15:11.00]I want him to be happy here too.
[15:13.20]Let's go out with the old and in with the new.
[15:16.80]Okay.
[15:17.56]So I need to do this job to unlock the pet stuff.
[15:20.40]And watch out for that train.
[15:23.62]Okay.
[15:27.24]Get rid of that trash.
[15:28.06]This is a nice house.
[15:37.77]Is that a... This is Pet's DLC.
[15:39.15]Look at this.
[15:41.58]They added animals!
[15:43.30]Look at this, Pets DLC!
[15:50.80]Why am I still fuckin' Santa Claus?
[15:56.14]No, I don't have to do any of this.
[15:59.11]I actually don't have to do any of this.
[16:05.45]No, I- I- I don't- Wait, remove weeds?
[16:07.49]Do I really have to do this?
[16:12.37]Alright, I guess I'll remove the weeds.
[16:13.91]Eat the bugs.
[16:19.70]Oh, look at that giraffe!
[16:22.06]This is cool.
[16:23.56]Alright, so just to clean up the trash.
[16:29.51]Oh!
[16:31.21]Can you step in dog shit in this game?
[16:33.93]Oh, that's too bad.
[16:34.95]It would've been kind of funny if it was like... And then you could just walk around and just track dog shit through the house.
[16:43.37]Again, this is a very relevant time for me to bring this up.
[16:46.13]I have to say it again.
[16:49.25]When was the last time you stepped in dog shit?
[16:52.81]It hasn't.
[16:53.13]I don't think it's happened since I was probably like 13.
[16:55.55]It's never happened to me.
[16:59.57]Maybe like ever.
[17:01.27]Maybe once or twice ever.
[17:04.18]Never, right?
[17:05.38]It's always like such a trope, but I feel like it never happens to anybody.
[17:10.44]Okay.
[17:10.54]Okay.
[17:12.61]Wait, where are my tools?
[17:16.19]Oh, I just smeared that around.
[17:22.04]I wouldn't put this on the counter.
[17:23.30]Is that a fucking owl?
[17:29.37]Can you hear this?
[17:45.64]There's an owl in here!
[17:46.62]Those all sounded like fucking toilet sounds.
[17:56.33]Alright, this sounds way too fucking high.
[18:08.30]That's freaky.
[18:08.74]I don't like that.
[18:14.02]What happened in here?
[18:16.09]Why are there bird feathers everywhere?
[18:25.68]It's a pigeon.
[18:27.72]Well, where?
[18:32.16]Is this place... Were there, like, animal parties in here or something?
[18:37.45]There's dog tracks.
[18:39.27]There's bird feathers everywhere.
[18:40.93]There's, like, piss on the ground.
[18:42.27]Were they just hanging out in here?
[18:46.40]No, that's not dog prints, are they?
[18:57.27]What are they doing up here?
[19:04.21]Oh yeah, he's gonna pick up all the trash.
[19:07.71]What the fuck?
[19:08.70]What's happening?
[19:12.70]Who's calling me?
[19:13.54]Seriously?
[19:14.48]There's a dog in my house?
[19:18.01]I can't keep him for Jasper's safety.
[19:20.43]Why is there a dog up here?
[19:21.65]But my good friend may figure something out.
[19:26.89]I'll tell him to get in touch with you.
[19:28.85]Why is there a dog up in the box in the attic?
[19:33.02]Hi, it's Morgan.
[19:35.82]It looks like this puppy needs a new home.
[19:39.50]Is it going to be my puppy?
[19:44.71]But do I?
[19:45.05]Yes, of course.
[19:52.16]But we... Yes!
[19:54.88]What do you mean I can't do that?
[19:59.95]Okay.
[20:00.73]Alright.
[20:01.35]Why does he have a weird hat on?
[20:11.41]What do I do with the dog now?
[20:14.98]Um, what am I supposed to do with the dog?
[20:16.90]Uh... You wanna sit down over here?
[20:24.23]Hey, um, you're kind of dirty.
[20:28.97]How do I clean the dog?
[20:29.91]Do we have to, like, go to a dog, like, groomer or something?
[20:36.86]This, no, that's not how you do it.
[20:38.28]Why is there blood up here?
[20:41.36]What is this?
[20:42.12]Use, what's this?
[20:43.84]Bunnies are very lively animals and need a lot of space to have fun.
[20:50.79]Okay.
[20:51.81]The best option is a free roam room.
[20:55.31]But sometimes they will be safer in a closed one, especially when we have other animals at home or unsecured stairs.
[21:02.95]I don't know.
[21:05.84]Free roam room, I guess?
[21:08.62]Is what I'm deciding on?
[21:13.78]Are you okay?
[21:14.26]Okay, that just freaked me out for a second.
[21:16.64]I was like, what happened?
[21:23.29]Unsafe rabbit room.
[21:24.89]Unsafe.
[21:31.53]Really?
[21:31.83]Um... What?
[21:43.64]This puppy's name is Lassie.
[21:47.44]Helper, energetic, and is a fussy eater.
[21:49.58]Okay.
[21:50.92]So let's, um... You want some food?
[21:58.82]Oh.
[21:58.96]Alright, I want a treat.
[22:04.98]You actually throw them.
[22:07.12]Okay, what about clean?
[22:09.85]What is tug of war?
[22:11.03]Like cat.
[22:13.81]Pet is busy.
[22:19.83]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[22:21.67]Slow down.
[22:21.93]Fetch.
[22:26.62]Fetch.
[22:30.88]Oh, go get it!
[22:32.98]Where'd it go?
[22:38.60]Will you catch it in the air?
[22:43.34]I got it, I got it, I got it!
[22:44.16]Don't go up there.
[22:44.74]Please don't go up there.
[22:45.38]Alright.
[22:47.43]Alright.
[22:48.05]Let me see it.
[22:48.57]Alright, fetch.
[22:52.39]Wait, how many things can I use?
[22:55.47]Will... Are they gonna catch it?
[23:10.10]You alright?
[23:12.46]Are you okay?
[23:22.15]Okay.
[23:23.87]Now, we're going to get rid of these.
[23:25.21]I need to give you a bath or something.
[23:26.83]How do I remove these?
[23:29.37]Just remove it.
[23:29.91]I don't want to throw it over the fucking fence.
[23:33.11]Okay, how are we doing up here with the cleaning?
[23:38.83]Looks good.
[23:40.37]This looks good.
[23:43.43]Looks good.
[23:46.08]Gotta clean these, uh, windows.
[23:50.88]Looks good.
[23:54.30]I ju- I lit- I tr- I would- Look!
[23:56.72]Watch!
[24:00.30]I thought- Okay, so when I went like this, he jumped in the air!
[24:06.71]He jumped in the air one time, didn't he?
[24:09.43]He went like this.
[24:10.39]I thought he was going to jump up and grab it.
[24:12.17]I don't know.
[24:14.65]Don't be sad.
[24:15.27]Here, just take another one.

[25:05.13]Actually, maybe you shouldn't come down here.
[25:06.90]It's probably kind of dangerous.
[25:14.12]What the fuck is all this?
[25:20.33]We're not playing Thief Simulator.
[25:21.97]What even is that, then?
[25:26.77]I thought this was a painting.

[38:05.35]I want another 5 grand.
[38:13.55]Alright, here we go.
[38:14.07]Yeah, alright.
[38:14.53]Let's go.
[38:16.21]Appreciate it.
[38:16.89]Accept the offer.
[38:21.83]I didn't do anything to this house.
[38:22.91]I didn't even care.
[38:32.75]Holy shit.
[38:41.12]These are not the photos you want to put on the realtor website.
[38:48.43]But it's alright, I sold it.
[38:50.69]Art of the deal.
[38:51.57]Now let's... Ah, this is like so... I hate this.
[39:00.18]We're not staying here, though.
[39:01.48]I'm moving to another house.
[39:03.34]And this... The microphone shadow makes it look like you have a black eye.
[39:07.90]Oh, whatever.
[39:08.72]Okay.
[39:10.10]Alright, now we're going to go sell the other house.
[39:15.92]Is there a stain on your webcam?
[39:17.43]No, it's a shadow.
[39:18.87]And there's gunk in my ear or something.
[39:21.93]It feels weird in there.

[39:49.92]Sell it.
[39:53.09]$268,000.
[39:54.51]I just want what I paid for it.
[40:00.29]Turn the ambience down.
[40:01.33]I will.

[40:07.32]I should have sold them the other one.
[40:11.60]Okay, $184,000.
[40:13.16]Alright, let me negotiate a little bit here.

[40:19.78]Whatever.
[40:20.08]Okay.
[40:22.56]Alright.
[40:22.76]I lost a thousand.
[40:23.28]It doesn't matter.
[40:23.86]Fine.
[40:25.67]I just need... I need capital.
[40:32.97]That's a handshake deal if I've ever seen one.
[40:45.10]It just got a little darker.
[40:47.68]The time of day changed.
[40:49.16]That's the only difference.
[40:52.33]Oh my god.
[41:01.01]What happened to the driveway?
[41:08.28]I gotta sell the versus Ludwig house.
[41:11.38]I feel like I might get some good money for that one.
[41:19.57]I got 450,000 bucks.
[41:20.85]We're going to do another couple of animal jobs because I want to unlock some more animal houses.
[41:25.99]Okay, owned.
[41:29.38]This is where I am right now.
[41:30.84]So I'm going to sell this one.
[41:31.98]And then I'll buy another one eventually here.
[41:40.70]No more birds, please.
[41:41.68]I'll fix it in a minute.
[41:54.56]It's even, like, still too loud at 0.08.
[41:55.88]We are down to one cent, and I can still hear them.
[42:06.53]Okay, that's fine.
[42:07.23]Is that better?
[42:15.28]That's fine right there.
[42:22.01]Alright, so I saw I'm going to sell this house.
[42:24.46]Put it on auction.
[42:25.16]Oh, this is going to be a big profit.
[42:35.00]I forget what happened in this one.
[42:39.58]I'll take it.
[42:43.25]Not bad.
[42:47.65]You took it from the bed, which is weird.
[42:55.67]Not much change there.
[42:56.69]TV?
[42:59.67]Alright.
[43:02.81]I got like six or seven hundred thousand dollars now.
[43:05.85]I got a lot of money.
[43:07.17]I can take that and I can buy a huge, like half a million dollar house.
[43:12.65]Then I'm gonna have snakes.
[43:14.52]I'm gonna have spiders.
[43:15.32]I'm gonna have other animals.
[43:19.04]We're not gonna stay here for very long.

[48:00.53]Alright.
[48:02.23]I'm just doing this to unlock.
[48:02.95]Rubber chicken.
[48:07.74]Rubber chicken.
[48:12.12]Chew... Chew toy?
[48:16.08]Tennis ball.
[48:17.98]Okay.
[48:19.82]A big cat tree.
[48:24.26]Put it right here so they can look out the window.
[48:27.36]Cats really like looking out windows, right?
[48:31.13]Hmm.
[48:33.13]That's alright.
[48:33.61]Okay.
[48:36.09]A mouse cat toy.
[48:37.37]You got it.
[48:37.79]Okay.
[48:40.45]Okay.
[48:43.81]Okay, one of these over here.
[48:47.80]Okay, litter box.
[48:49.02]Alright, that should go right here.
[48:52.18]Looks good.
[48:54.30]Now I need two of these.
[48:55.00]Alright, that's fine.
[48:56.92]Right, uh... Um... Right here.
[49:01.84]Okay, I need a pee pad.
[49:04.53]There's a lot of shit going on in this room.
[49:07.47]Pee pad?
[49:07.95]Alright, I need a pee pants.
[49:09.81]Put it right... Let's put it over here.
[49:13.89]Like, over here?
[49:23.66]No, not near the food.
[49:24.88]Like, right here.
[49:26.00]This needs to move.
[49:30.74]There's toys everywhere.
[49:32.26]You're messing with the feng shui.
[49:33.40]Alright, pee pad will go right here.
[49:39.13]And then this litter box will go right here.
[49:41.53]Okay, that's fine.
[49:44.18]Alright, now this is a dog carpet.
[49:47.42]Really cool.
[49:48.28]Okay, and then we're going to do a double foot stool.
[49:55.59]For... What is this for?
[50:00.41]What is this for?
[50:02.81]You can't fit all this shit in this room.
[50:04.17]Okay.
[50:07.87]Okay.
[50:10.37]Automatic cat water feeder?
[50:13.04]There's too many... They're all gonna be in this room at the same time?
[50:19.14]What?
[50:29.29]Dog enclosure?
[50:40.65]Um... Interior dog enclosure.
[50:51.66]Like this?
[50:54.08]Just little dividers?
[50:54.94]Alright, that's fine.
[51:25.93]Put it down.
[51:28.29]I can't put this down.
[51:29.05]Why?
[51:31.98]There's so much shit in this room.
[51:40.32]Oh, wait.
[51:40.58]Okay.
[51:44.10]It doesn't matter.
[51:44.52]Like, there's so much shit in this room.
[51:49.40]Read chat.
[51:50.00]What?
[51:53.32]He said the attic, too.
[51:55.93]Use the other rooms.
[51:57.09]I thought it was... Yeah, but the game usually is whatever room you're in, it tells you what to do.
[52:07.76]That's usually how the game works, right?
[52:09.40]It's whatever room you're currently in.
[52:10.75]These are the objects that you need to put in here.
[52:13.15]That's how it's been the whole time.
[52:14.51]Forever.
[52:14.87]For like five years.
[52:20.21]Floor tiles.
[52:26.35]I'll move it.
[52:31.61]It's been like that forever.
[52:33.25]It's whatever room you're currently in.
[52:36.79]For the missions, at least.
[52:42.27]Yeah, no, it is this room.
[52:43.35]See, room 37M2?
[52:44.81]It is this room.
[52:49.58]Yeah, I was right.
[52:52.06]Put the food under the mats.
[52:55.40]Alright.
[52:57.86]Bon appetit!
[53:00.11]Can I?
[53:00.41]Look, he can rearrange this however much he wants.
[53:30.14]There we go.
[53:30.68]Okay.
[53:30.98]See?
[53:31.16]That's better.
[53:32.64]Toys need to go in the corner.
[53:33.94]This is not even my house.
[53:36.58]I don't want to put that much time into this because I want to do my own.
[53:40.04]This is not my house.
[53:41.26]I'm just trying to make some money so I can buy my own animal house.
[53:45.38]If you want to come in here and rearrange it, that's fine.
[53:47.48]You can come in and do it.
[53:49.99]This is a home designing game.
[53:53.19]Bro, House Flipper is my number one most played game on stream.
[53:57.35]You don't think I know what I'm supposed- I'm just trying to do the missions quickly to be able to buy the house.
[54:02.91]Bro?
[54:13.45]Okay.
[54:16.09]Now we gotta go to the attic.
[54:16.82]Where are the mats?
[54:24.23]I just want to do the mission so I can unlock the stuff!
[54:32.07]Because I want to make my own!
[54:38.16]I didn't say sell my awesome entertainment center, dude.
[54:43.06]Oh, you didn't?
[54:43.88]Oh, okay.
[54:45.14]Oops.
[54:52.85]Actually, you did want me to do that.
[54:53.87]Alright.
[54:55.51]Bunny enclosure.
[54:56.91]Yeah, it is the same room.
[54:57.97]Alright, so where should this go?
[55:01.65]Like, in the corner over here, I'm thinking.
[55:03.41]It doesn't matter.
[55:03.93]I'm gonna do my own.
[55:04.77]Okay.
[55:11.37]This is for a... Is it for a Guinea pig?
[55:15.00]Whoa.
[55:15.88]That's huge.
[55:16.34]Okay, let's put this one over here.
[55:17.16]Okay.
[55:20.72]Turtle aquarium?
[55:24.94]I want to do this so bad.
[55:25.94]I don't care about this other person's house.
[55:29.52]I want a bunch of turtles.
[55:30.48]I want a bunch of... There's hamsters, too?
[55:32.40]Hamsters?
[55:36.58]Look at how cool this is.
[55:54.43]Okay.
[55:56.76]Furry carpet.
[55:59.21]Okay.
[56:00.91]A big pantry.
[56:02.77]Sure thing.
[56:04.85]And... Poof.
[56:09.95]Okay.
[56:11.60]Poof over there.
[56:12.62]Poof over here.
[56:13.84]And a poof over here.
[56:15.00]Sounds good.
[56:15.68]Awesome.
[56:16.10]Alright, cool.
[56:16.98]I'm gonna give you that money so I can do my own.
[56:22.16]There's one more down here, right?
[56:23.24]Okay.
[56:27.94]Yeah, the house is already pretty nice.
[56:31.86]What are the rooms?
[56:32.42]It was downstairs, right?
[56:38.86]Yeah, this room looks like shit.
[56:40.06]I know, but I'm just trying... Where do I need to go?
[56:49.54]The bathroom.
[56:50.16]Okay.
[56:52.35]Bathroom.
[56:55.35]The upstairs bathroom or downstairs bathroom?
[56:59.35]Wasn't that the attic that I was just in?
[57:04.45]Yeah, I did the attic already.
[57:07.66]What a bathroom I just was in.
[57:08.70]I don't... I don't fucking know.
[57:16.66]This is the bathroom.
[57:19.67]Bathroom?
[57:25.89]Um... Where's there another bathroom on this floor?
[57:29.99]Do you have a bathroom in the backyard?
[57:33.06]No.
[57:33.44]There's another bathroom.
[57:35.10]First floor bathroom.
[57:36.24]Yeah.
[57:37.46]How come this says 11 meters by second power?
[57:41.28]Not 12.
[57:41.70]Where is it?
[57:55.13]Oh, here it is.
[57:56.41]Alright, let's go.
[58:02.56]Bathtub plumbing system.
[58:03.76]We want to get rid of that.
[58:05.98]Alright.
[58:06.38]Okay.
[58:06.92]Alright.
[58:08.84]Arrange the ceiling tiles.
[58:15.94]Cool.
[58:18.02]Oh, that's right.
[58:18.50]You can do ceilings now.
[58:20.17]Right.
[58:20.53]That's part of the update.
[58:24.97]You can paint ceilings.
[58:26.01]You can tile ceilings now.
[58:27.37]It's a big update.
[58:29.75]Big deal.
[58:35.25]Alright, I did it.
[58:38.63]That's fine.
[58:39.01]I don't need to do anything else.
[58:39.89]Goodbye.
[58:42.29]I'm just trying to unlock the stuff.
[58:57.27]I didn't... All that trash, I didn't do that.
[59:00.37]This dude has no passion in his work.
[59:03.04]I'm... You'll... You want to see passion, you'll see it.
[59:05.69]Just wait.
[59:07.19]I think I probably unlocked another house.
[59:08.51]Okay, browse.
[59:17.01]For purchase.
[59:19.59]Alright.
[59:20.67]I just unlocked that house.
[59:22.13]Should I try to find another one that's bigger?
[59:30.63]I think I want a bigger house than that.
[59:35.31]I want a huge house.
[59:42.87]That one looks alright.
[59:46.56]No, that one looks pretty big.
[59:48.84]Okay, this one's huge.
[59:51.04]This one's huge.
[59:52.34]Mine is right on the water.
[59:55.18]Let's get this one.
[59:58.54]I need a man-sized house.
[60:06.24]Actually, this is not that big.
[60:07.14]Mm-hmm.
[60:07.44]Yeah.
[60:21.59]This is what I truly need.
[60:23.85]I always imagined myself in my skelly cutie in a lakeside house.
[60:29.17]With a wooden terrace.
[60:30.95]And maybe even a small sauna.
[60:33.88]Somewhere I would be able to flourish as a writer.
[60:37.16]But I don't... This is not big enough.
[60:38.42]Or perhaps put more time into working on my paintings.
[60:41.34]This might be the perfect moment for a change.
[60:43.92]I could have different houses for different animals.
[60:45.82]For me and my lovely boat.
[60:53.25]You need a man-sized dinosaur park.
[60:57.39]This is a huge yard, though.
[61:01.59]Okay.
[61:02.31]This is a lot of work.
[61:04.51]You can change the stairs.
[61:09.49]I think this is a lot of work.
[61:11.01]Oh, this is big, though.
[61:13.79]Yeah, this is big.
[61:15.15]This is huge.
[61:16.19]Look at how big this is.
[61:18.17]There's a lot of downstairs real estate there.
[61:22.99]Okay.
[61:24.85]Alright.
[61:25.39]Alright.
[61:25.87]I think I want this one.
[61:30.91]I think I want this one.
[61:35.34]Is it available now, or do I have to do the mission first?
[61:39.36]Fill this house with spiders.
[61:40.76]What do you mean I can't have it?
[61:43.93]Why not?
[61:50.25]I wonder if it's unlocked.
[61:51.99]If I have to do the mission first, that sucks.
[61:53.66]I'm gonna have to clean this whole house.
[61:54.64]I'm gonna have to clean the house twice.
[62:04.14]I'm gonna have to clean the whole... Okay, I'm gonna do speedrun it.
[62:08.72]I'll speedrun it.
[62:14.02]Okay, I'm gonna speedrun it.
[62:19.64]I'm just gonna do the bare minimum.
[62:28.45]I want this house.
[62:29.35]I want this house.
[62:30.25]Alright, here we go.
[62:33.31]Time to speed run.
[62:34.73]Go.
[63:06.33]Fast.
[63:06.89]Very fast.
[63:18.30]Okay.
[63:19.46]Fuck that.
[63:19.90]I'm just gonna do the... This is gonna take too long.
[63:25.00]I'm going in.
[63:36.36]There's just shit everywhere.
[63:37.78]I'm going to have different enclosures for different animals.
[63:40.60]Okay, looks good.
[63:48.74]Let's get the broom out here quick.
[63:50.48]And I'm just going to start placing objects.
[64:00.95]Do you want to play the game?
[64:05.39]That's what I'm doing.
[64:07.23]I want to just do this mission real quick.
[64:08.91]Because here's the thing.
[64:10.10]I'm going to buy this house and I'm going to have to do this all over again.
[64:13.52]Don't you understand?
[64:15.22]I don't want to sit here and just waste time if I'm going to have to do the whole thing again anyways.
[64:22.86]Okay.
[64:24.84]You want this.
[64:28.78]I wouldn't pick this, but that's your choice.
[64:33.08]I'm just trying to fill the progress meter.
[64:37.21]Uh-huh.
[64:41.01]Looks good.
[64:42.23]You wanted in the whole thing, right?
[64:43.38]Alright, beautiful.
[64:52.66]I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't do this.
[64:55.24]Play Break Core.
[64:57.67]No, it's way too early to do that.
[64:59.35]It's way too early to start playing Break Core during the stream.
[65:04.43]Just keep, you're gonna have to wait a few minutes.
[65:08.23]Okay.
[65:08.87]Just, whatever.
[65:09.59]Just go like this.
[65:12.09]Okay.
[65:13.39]I need this.
[65:16.00]It does not matter where the fuck it goes.
[65:17.54]I don't care.
[65:19.94]This is the dump sink that you want.
[65:21.30]That's fine.
[65:21.76]Okay.
[65:30.73]Okay.
[65:44.00]I'm just going for completion.
[65:45.38]Trust me when I say I'm not.
[65:46.88]This is just to get, so I can get in the house.
[65:57.89]The cabinet's on the ceiling.
[66:01.53]I'm, trust me.
[66:03.16]I know people are like, dude, just fucking play.
[66:05.08]But I have to do this all over again.
[66:29.44]I feel like I'm a moving company that just brought all the shit in here, put it in there, and just left.
[66:35.70]Wait, I thought, wasn't part of the charge that you were gonna help me assemble?
[66:39.04]Nope.
[66:45.89]It's like if an AI played the game.
[66:49.29]It does look like that.
[66:52.89]It does.
[66:53.71]The AI just knows it has to do one specific task.
[66:57.42]That's fucking funny.
[66:58.46]Whatever.
[67:05.60]That progress meter is gonna- this would take like six fucking hours if I were to do this legit.
[67:11.38]Don't you want those six hours to be spent making our own house, not somebody else's?
[67:16.60]Don't you get it?
[67:20.16]What is this?!
[67:22.24]Oh my god!
[67:26.02]Wait, can this go in the other room?
[67:27.44]It can't go in another room!
[67:28.76]The fucking iguana enclosure has to go in here.
[67:36.28]Oh my goodness.
[67:37.78]Whatever.
[67:38.10]I'm running out of room.
[67:58.41]You want two of these?
[67:59.23]Where do you want me to put them?
[68:05.37]It doesn't matter.
[68:06.05]It does not matter.
[68:07.23]Can I put it... Okay.
[68:18.97]This would have taken so fucking long, and you all know it.
[68:21.65]This would have taken four hours to do all this.
[68:26.73]You have to trust me on this.
[68:27.81]Just please trust me.
[68:30.23]Just please trust me.
[68:49.94]Okay, and you want your TV... I don't care where your TV goes.
[68:54.40]I really don't.
[68:56.00]Alright.
[68:57.48]Pretty good.
[68:58.90]Now I just need to do the rest of the house.
[69:02.78]This would've taken me fucking six hours.
[69:05.11]Okay, where's the terrace?
[69:12.75]The garden.
[69:13.43]You want me to do all this shit out in the garden?
[69:18.23]This would've taken forever.
[69:19.13]Forever.
[69:26.54]I will spend time on mine.
[69:27.92]Okay.
[69:33.04]This is going to be a lot of progress.
[69:42.87]Yep, that progress meter is going up.
[69:44.19]Okay, terrace.
[69:50.24]Clean the dirt.
[70:01.44]Do you sound like a Dr. Seuss book?
[70:03.20]What?
[70:07.54]Alright, I need to do... Ooh, this is gonna be nice.
[70:12.31]Okay.
[70:13.19]You want these out here.
[70:15.05]I know there's puke everywhere, it's fine.
[70:22.15]We're just going for progress.
[70:23.27]Again, I will reiterate a million times if I have to.
[70:25.49]I want a nice hangout zone out here.
[70:43.82]Decorative puke?
[70:45.74]It kinda, it does look like decorative puke, you're right.
[70:55.61]Can you imagine?
[70:57.35]I thought that cannon just shot at me.
[71:03.02]So you hire somebody to come clean and rearrange your whole house.
[71:07.24]And the whole time they're going, I gotta hurry the fuck up.
[71:09.22]I gotta clean my house.
[71:11.69]I gotta take care of my house.
[71:12.75]I gotta rearrange my furniture.
[71:15.01]So they do a half-assed job on your house.
[71:18.89]That's kind of unfair, isn't it?
[71:21.87]Oh well.
[71:29.92]Is this the terrace too?
[71:31.96]It is.
[71:43.33]That progress needs to go up.
[71:48.07]Is this helping?
[71:50.31]Kind of.
[71:50.65]Okay.
[71:58.42]Clean that up.
[71:58.90]I think we're almost halfway there.
[72:05.50]Get the spray.
[72:06.06]I can't... Oh, there we go.
[72:12.44]Okay, close that up.
[72:13.52]Looks nice.
[72:14.26]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[72:15.84]Clean.
[72:20.77]How much progress has the window given me, I wonder?
[72:30.47]That always feels so good.
[72:35.22]Nice.
[72:35.42]Okay.
[72:37.40]Remove weeds...
[72:40.58]Only 10%.
[72:41.40]This is really dragging the progress down.
[72:47.02]Yeah, definitely.
[72:48.40]This shouldn't take too long to get all these.
[72:49.58]Yeah, that's definitely filling up fast.
[73:06.29]Use the flamethrower?
[73:07.17]I don't even have it.
[73:21.03]I think this is slower.
[73:21.87]This is slower.
[73:27.39]70, 80%.
[73:32.76]Let's go.
[73:33.12]97%. 98%.
[73:50.20]Dirt?
[73:50.70]Where?
[73:56.81]Okay, alright.
[73:57.53]We're good?
[74:02.69]There's one here.
[74:06.37]99.
[74:11.12]Just gimme the fucking house already.
[74:14.38]Okay.
[74:15.94]There's a few more windows to clean.
[74:21.40]Uh, wash.
[74:25.85]New basement entrance.
[74:28.93]Oh, that went away.
[74:30.17]That's gone.
[74:30.67]Okay, well, sorry.
[74:32.39]You have no access to your house anymore.
[74:37.91]Very nice.
[74:38.37]Okay, halfway there.
[74:52.46]Can I not climb in through the window?
[74:55.06]You gotta be kidding me.
[75:00.06]Okay, here we go.
[75:01.64]By... this shit.
[75:06.60]It's already there.
[75:08.56]This.
[75:12.45]This.
[75:16.33]This.
[75:21.29]Chair.
[75:24.76]Light switch.
[75:27.95]Three of these.
[75:32.45]Six of these candles.
[75:41.65]Okay.
[75:43.45]Where's the passion?
[75:44.53]I don't have any passion for this.
[75:46.37]I need to get to my house.
[75:49.30]What do you mean?
[75:50.12]I don't have any passion.
[75:53.77]I have lots of passion for my own space.
[75:55.71]I'll show it to you.
[75:57.56]This is just to get the money to fucking... There's no passion.
[76:12.36]I will show it to you.
[76:18.53]You want to see?
[76:19.01]I will show you passion.
[76:19.85]I promise.
[76:20.21]This is going to be a long stream, so don't worry.
[76:23.29]It's fine.
[76:26.23]I don't know how many they wanted, but that's enough.
[76:28.27]And then cigars or something.
[76:29.23]Alright, here we go.
[76:29.97]Alright, cool.
[76:30.45]Look at that progress.
[76:31.17]Almost done.
[76:33.53]There's still some trash that needs to come out of this room.
[76:37.30]Clean that up.
[76:43.80]It doesn't matter.
[76:44.30]Alright, let's go in this room.
[76:45.36]What do you want in here?
[76:46.65]Yep.
[76:49.47]Okay, here we go.
[76:50.19]We're good.
[76:56.95]That's an ugly bed.
[76:58.14]I'm sorry.
[76:59.68]That actually, I think, is an ugly bed.
[77:07.06]See, I don't care about this shit.
[77:08.76]It's not my house.
[77:22.68]How are you supposed to fit all this shit?
[77:24.26]People put way too much stuff in their bedrooms.
[77:26.84]You know what you need in your bedroom?
[77:28.37]Here's what you need in your bedroom.
[77:29.45]You need a bed, an end table, a lamp, and that's it.
[77:41.15]And maybe a drawer like this for your clothes.
[77:44.29]People put too much shit in their bedrooms.
[77:50.82]You need maybe like a painting above the bed or something, right?
[77:55.94]Or like on the wall, like over here.
[77:57.68]I don't know, people put way too much shit in their bedroom.
[78:01.55]Like, I don't want this.
[78:03.18]I don't want a fucking gigantic tropical plant next to me when I sleep.
[78:06.02]I just don't want one.
[78:07.40]I feel like I'm just going to get in the way.
[78:08.36]I'm going to get annoyed by it.
[78:10.28]Ceiling fans?
[78:10.96]I'm scared of ceiling fans.
[78:12.56]I don't want to ceiling people.
[78:13.61]Oh, man, ceiling fans.
[78:14.55]No.
[78:15.65]Ceiling fans, I feel like they're going to spin and drop and kill me.
[78:17.83]And they're going to chop me up into a thousand pieces.
[78:19.73]I actually think that.
[78:20.63]When I pull the lever and I see a ceiling fan spinning, it always freaks me out.
[78:25.84]I don't like it.
[78:29.03]Sometimes some ceiling fans aren't really screwed on all the way and they kind of go like this while they spin really fast and it's just like that doesn't look... I want that to be secured with a bolt.
[78:37.75]I don't like it.
[78:54.15]Oh, these are pictures.
[78:55.15]I was like, what does it got on these?
[78:58.56]That's supposed to happen.
[78:59.75]No, I don't like it.
[79:03.07]I don't care if it's supposed to happen or not.
[79:08.59]I don't want to be looking straight up at a thing that is going like this, spinning really fast.
[79:18.42]Because I'm afraid to close my eyes under that.
[79:22.98]I don't like it.
[79:23.54]Something about it freaks me out.
[79:32.03]What can I even put this on?
[79:36.63]What is this supposed to go on?
[79:42.62]A shelf or something?
[79:44.84]Okay, there we go.
[79:45.32]Okay, almost done.
[79:51.11]You want the same carpet everywhere.
[79:52.65]Two of them?
[79:53.07]Really?
[80:01.22]Why do you want this in your room?
[80:04.26]This is a swing?
[80:10.08]You're putting way too much shit in your bedroom.
[80:14.29]Your bedroom, for me, I mean, that's a place to sleep.
[80:17.73]You go sleep.
[80:20.41]I don't want a bunch of distractions and just shit everywhere.
[80:28.51]Okay.
[80:29.43]Almost done.
[80:35.79]And plus, we're taking down some walls as well.
[80:37.85]This is not the way that I want my house to be.
[80:41.21]Okay, what do you want?
[80:43.67]Paint the ceiling with lime cream?
[81:02.36]Alright.
[81:08.17]Okay.
[81:09.71]Mountable oval bathtub.
[81:13.09]You want these on the wall?
[81:14.45]Is that what I'm assuming?
[81:17.42]Yeah.
[81:17.98]Okay, here we go.
[81:25.18]We're almost there.
[81:28.49]Santa's got way more important shit to be doing right now.
[81:37.88]You guys understand?
[81:39.84]I think, you know what's bullshit?
[81:43.46]We treat Santa like a Madden release.
[81:48.04]This motherfucker has to prepare Christmas for just a one year?
[81:53.91]No, no, no.
[81:55.31]Christmas should be every two years.
[81:57.03]So Santa has more time to fucking deal with the presents.
[82:01.98]I don't know.
[82:02.62]I feel like he doesn't have enough time.
[82:05.26]It takes at least a fucking year to get this shit ready.
[82:15.05]Santa's not real.
[82:17.01]Madden isn't real either.
[82:20.97]What?
[82:21.99]What are you talking about?
[82:25.86]Start timing people up for that.
[82:27.94]I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
[82:29.22]It's annoying though.
[82:39.33]Where does this go?
[82:45.15]Are you sponsored by Santa?
[82:48.54]No.
[82:52.76]How dare you say Madden isn't real?
[82:59.48]Every new Madden game isn't... What are you talking about?
[83:01.82]Alright, we're almost there.
[83:07.30]There it is.
[83:07.70]Okay, put it together.
[83:16.45]Like all the WWE games, all the NBA games, they come out once a year, and... Come on, Gwen.
[83:37.26]I'm sad that the court stream never happened.
[83:39.52]Me too.
[83:41.88]That joke is long, long dead, though.
[83:44.64]Unfortunately.
[83:55.27]Okay.
[83:57.19]What's gonna put it over the edge here?
[83:58.69]One of the showers?
[84:11.98]Multiple sink.
[84:13.04]That's right here.
[84:23.15]Explain?
[84:27.46]Um... Oh, there's probably a lot of you that don't know what I'm talking about.
[84:31.15]Or what Chad is talking about, either.
[84:33.75]Uh, years ago... I... Um, I killed Santa on stream.
[84:40.95]Like... I don't know, was it like 2016 or something?
[84:44.31]2017?
[84:46.36]And the joke was I was going to go to court for it.
[84:50.70]And get tried for the murder of Santa.
[84:52.72]Oh.
[84:54.81]And we were going to have lawyers.
[84:56.79]Santa's lawyer was going to sing all the prosecution.
[85:02.83]I was going to be up, he was going to be cross-examining witnesses and stuff, and he was going to be singing the whole thing.
[85:10.62]At the end, it was going to be up to you guys if I was guilty or innocent.
[85:15.90]And the punishment was going to be the judge was going to smash the gavel down and say, like, I sentenced you to three Minecraft streams in a row.
[85:23.74]And he's going to smash the thing and everyone's going to freak out, everyone's going to start fucking screaming, everyone's going to start crying and stuff.
[85:29.44]And that was gonna be the joke.
[85:30.96]And I had to play Minecraft three times.
[85:32.14]There you go, this is the whole thing.
[85:34.32]Because there's just no way it's happening.
[85:36.24]Like, ever.
[85:41.83]Guilty, yeah.
[85:42.85]Everyone would have said guilty.
[85:43.83]There's no way you would have made me innocent.
[85:45.79]Not even remotely a chance, though.
[85:54.09]Can you just play Minecraft for real?
[85:58.33]No, I can't.
[85:59.04]I don't play.
[85:59.60]I can't play Minecraft.
[86:00.69]I can't.
[86:04.56]Every time I play Minecraft, especially if I make a video or stream Minecraft, I do the same thing every time.
[86:11.47]I start to build a dirt house.
[86:13.05]I make a wooden floor.
[86:14.93]I make a cobblestone wall.
[86:16.97]The ceiling is half cobblestone, half dirt with five to ten holes in it.
[86:21.90]And then I go dig down and I make what I'm going to say is I'm going to make a mine down here that connects to the bottom of the house.
[86:28.14]And then I die at the bottom and I uninstall the game.
[86:31.46]It happens every single time.
[86:34.94]I don't think I've ever gotten past the... Making a fully cobblestone enclosed house.
[86:42.38]I don't think I've ever gotten... I've gotten like iron in my inventory.
[86:50.64]Do you still consider yourself a Bostonian?
[86:52.18]Of course I do, kid.
[87:03.59]We're so close.
[87:04.55]And then I can finally start playing.
[87:11.05]Are those lights?
[87:11.65]I don't know.
[87:19.96]AI.
[87:20.96]Controlled placement.
[87:26.83]It's right there.
[87:27.83]Come on.
[87:28.35]One more.
[87:36.95]Okay, this is almost done.
[87:38.85]Oh, here we go.
[87:45.90]Look at that.
[87:46.56]One more little tick and that's it.
[87:48.04]I can probably just do it by cleaning.
[87:51.94]Oh, hell yeah.
[87:52.46]Yeah, I can do it by cleaning for sure.
[88:10.26]Come on, it's right there.
[88:11.34]It's so close.
[88:25.39]Look at it.
[88:30.05]It's so dirty.
[88:30.79]It's definitely going to be it, right?
[88:34.24]Monka.
[88:35.64]Monka.
[88:46.38]Come on!
[88:47.12]Finish!
[88:49.82]Just finish.
[88:55.69]Destroy the walls.
[88:59.99]I knew it was going to be so loud.
[89:00.87]I barely prepared for it.
[89:03.13]I realized what was happening before it was... There we go.
[89:05.98]Okay.
[89:06.12]Okay.
[89:28.93]Okay.
[89:30.35]Build the walls.
[89:31.46]Okay.
[89:31.58]Right here.
[89:38.26]Done.
[89:47.73]I turned this house into a hidden object game.
[89:58.90]They didn't even want to show you the living room.
[90:02.42]That's too bad.
[90:07.40]You should play a hidden object game.
[90:08.92]I have.
[90:10.90]Okay.
[90:12.47]Are you ready?
[90:14.95]Let's go.
[90:20.39]Here it is.
[90:21.37]Our cozy haven.
[90:24.25]Let's buy it.
[90:26.49]And I want to go there right now.
[90:29.07]Hey, remember all this shit that I just did?
[90:33.24]Hope you're ready to see it again.
[90:34.28]Why is my camera lag every time?
[90:44.91]Alright, actually, this is gonna go much faster.
[91:14.73]What?
[91:15.01]I have to buy a new one?
[92:06.00]That was so much faster.
[92:08.57]That was so much faster.
[92:09.77]I'm so glad that I can do that.
[92:16.35]He's looking for a spy.
[92:20.23]Where is he?
[92:26.34]And I fly fucking forward and he backstabs me after all this bullshit.
[92:38.60]Finally, like, get fucking stabbed.
[92:44.81]Have you seen the save TF2 thing?
[92:48.73]Uh, a little bit.
[92:50.31]A little bit.
[92:50.77]I'll give you my take on it.
[92:55.15]I would love to see Valve... The thing about TF2 is... TF2 is an old game, right?
[93:03.12]But if there are official Valve servers...
[93:07.90]If you're going to keep official servers turned on, I think that they... You need to support the game somehow, right?
[93:14.51]And if there are official Valve servers... Valve servers!
[93:20.43]That means that they're still officially, technically supporting the game.
[93:24.81]I would like to see some more updates to TF2.
[93:27.17]Forget about bug fixes or problems with the game or whatever, right?
[93:30.39]But I would really like to see them at least sometimes go in and just kind of... Fiddle with some knobs, right?
[93:38.47]That would be great.
[93:39.09]I don't know.
[93:41.92]What is Valve doing now?
[93:43.32]What is Valve up to?
[93:47.94]What's in the pipeline for Valve?
[93:51.16]Steam Deck?
[93:54.16]The game's currently unplayable right now.
[93:56.45]Yeah, I just... They kind of need to do something, right?
[94:00.85]So, I mean, I support anything to get... I mean, I love that game.
[94:04.85]I think that game's...
[94:07.29]That's literally the reason why I'm sitting in this chair, is because of that game.
[94:12.02]So, absolutely I support them coming in and fixing some of the problems that the game has, especially if they're going to officially support it.
[94:21.26]But on top of that, I would, like I said, I'd like to see at least something else.
[94:25.50]Or even... I mean, it's so easy to sit here and be like, I would love to do this!
[94:29.64]They should do this!
[94:30.52]I want the pirate to do this!
[94:31.82]I want the heavy to get this!
[94:33.52]But even just small little fixes, just to support the game.
[94:39.54]Will they do anything?
[94:40.42]I don't know.
[94:41.10]I don't know.
[94:41.54]I can't say that I would expect them to do very much.
[94:46.29]But it would be nice if they tried to do something with the game.
[94:53.20]But I don't think Valve is really in the business of video game making anymore.
[95:01.77]video game stuff.
[95:03.23]They're more hardware-related and business-related.
[95:06.51]Steam and their hardware shit is, I think, when almost all their focus is completely 100%.
[95:14.54]I don't know if that's gonna change.
[95:16.48]I mean, obviously they're doing really, really well.
[95:19.34]Steam is the platform for pretty much everything.
[95:22.54]So I don't know if they're ever gonna get back into trying to do game stuff.
[95:26.50]Will they actually come out with something besides?
[95:28.82]I mean, Alyx came out a couple years ago, right?
[95:31.10]But
[95:33.47]I don't know.
[95:34.49]The games that they have currently, that they kind of are operating as a service in a way.
[95:41.09]I mean, like, Counter... They still... What about, like, CSGO?
[95:44.17]Dota 2 still gets updates.
[95:46.23]CSGO still gets updates, right?
[95:50.44]Doesn't, like... CSGO, yeah.
[95:54.24]Dota 2 is still really supported.
[95:58.88]Yeah.
[95:59.02]Yeah.
[96:04.42]Yeah, I really do hope that they can at least support the games that they officially have.
[96:08.86]Especially official servers for.
[96:12.78]I guess that's my take on it, I guess.
[96:16.59]I mean, I love that game.
[96:17.57]I love everything about it.
[96:19.09]That's a huge reason why I am in the position I'm in today.
[96:22.61]Because I decided to make TF2 videos fucking 10 years ago.
[96:28.25]Without those games, I don't think I would be sitting here.
[96:32.26]I really don't think so.
[96:34.40]But whatever happens, happens, I guess.
[96:37.34]And I guess hopefully they can come up with some kind of solution.
[96:43.63]As I burn this whole fucking place to the ground.
[96:47.67]Let's... They should just let the game die.
[96:59.28]I mean...
[97:03.18]The hard part with that is... If they want to just turn it off... Then... Then that's... Okay, turn it off then, right?
[97:16.67]If you want to turn the game off, and that's it, we're not supporting servers anymore, then at least give some closure to everybody.
[97:25.57]As much as I don't want to see that happen, it's almost like, give us some closure.
[97:29.59]Give everybody closure.
[97:31.46]And, oh, hey, look, we're not doing official supported servers anymore.
[97:34.60]Our focus is in other places.
[97:36.64]But by all means, if you want to run community servers, blah, blah, blah, right?
[97:40.06]But if you want to pull the plug officially on it, then you got to do it.
[97:43.68]Like, well, closure for what?
[97:45.38]Closure just for... I think people expect, or not expect, but people really want them to be involved to help and do things and fix things and stuff.
[97:54.61]But if they don't want to, and there's been no real, I guess, communication to do so...
[98:02.54]then I don't know, right?
[98:03.46]Like, I don't know what their plans or goals are long-term.
[98:10.78]But, we'll see.
[98:12.74]TF2 is the blueprint.
[98:15.86]You've been walking in circles for 10 minutes.
[98:18.20]Yeah, go watch my Minecraft video.
[98:20.92]My Minecraft videos, where I went like this and talked about, like, what happened at my house today.
[98:27.57]I literally went like this for four, I think three or four hours.
[98:31.61]Going like this.
[98:34.11]And when it was brought to my attention, I was gonna, I think I was gonna delete the video, because I was embarrassed.
[98:38.45]I was like, holy fuck, what am I doing?
[98:41.42]I remember MLC Stealth told me, long time ago.
[98:45.34]He said, dude, I watched your Minecraft video, and you built and took down the same wall for about 12 minutes straight.
[98:54.99]It was, you did it like 15 times.
[98:57.49]So, I just, my brain just gets, when I have him talking, I can't fucking do anything.
[99:03.01]Alright, let's go.
[99:09.94]I don't want to buy any- I'm gonna buy shitload of fuel.
[99:19.45]But I will leave you with this.
[99:21.85]I do not really play TF2 anymore.
[99:25.67]I'm not really... I'm not into it anymore, but if you are, then I really hope that some kind of solution can happen.
[99:34.36]Because it's a great game.
[99:35.16]It's a fucking fantastic game.
[99:36.42]It's one of the best FPSs to ever release.
[99:38.40]So...
[99:48.21]Time for Smite Sundays.
[99:49.49]Time for Omega LOL Overwatch Wednesdays.
[100:11.31]No, I'm not, I'm, no.
[100:17.98]Think of all the bugs in the grass you are killing right now.
[100:40.53]I'm just trying to get to square one.
[101:17.14]Bug killer?
[101:18.02]Oh, stop!
[101:23.57]I'm not killing bugs.
[101:27.81]I checked!
[101:28.49]I checked before I started.
[101:47.69]Because there's going to be stuff out here.
[101:51.18]Animal stuff.
[101:52.08]It's got to be clean.
[101:53.04]Okay.
[102:15.65]Holy shit.
[102:16.99]That hurt my chest.
[102:18.37]Okay.
[102:30.02]That's good enough for now.
[102:31.32]Alright, let's clean.
[102:31.94]Hey, I... Come on.
[102:38.48]I was the master at being able to fake sick so I didn't have to go to school.
[102:45.43]no I feel I just like feel terrible oh oh you don't feel good no I can't go to school you said to your mom no I'm just saying it was oh
[103:15.82]Oh, fucking.
[103:20.06]So as you see here, this theory of the triangle and the circle, the Pythagorean theorem is fucking... It's got the angle in the middle here you had to solve for that is... Remember that joke?
[103:34.47]That was a good one.
[103:45.69]I'm gonna put new windows on, don't worry.
[103:46.84]I need to clean.
[103:51.84]I remember that, yeah.
[103:54.56]Do I don't have any more water?
[103:56.20]Where's my water?
[103:56.84]Where's the water?
[104:00.66]Excuse me.
[104:15.00]This, I gotta change this outside as well.
[104:17.07]You should play that.
[104:17.97]Play Where's My Water.
[104:18.93]What are you, fucking an iPad gamer from 2012?
[104:23.65]What are you talking about?
[104:47.16]Play iPad games.
[104:52.21]You know what I wanted to do?
[104:53.09]I wanted to watch a shitload of mobile ads.
[104:59.27]But we're going to have to do that in really small doses because they are insane.
[105:05.56]I don't think we could do that for three hours.
[105:07.88]I think we would all have... It would make us sick.
[105:14.92]As an avid iPad game connoisseur, let me tell you that some of the most ridiculous, insane bullshit that I've ever seen in my whole life happened while I was watching an iPad game ad.
[105:29.87]Or a phone ad.. You want to talk about a computer generating random shit?
[105:38.31]This is it.
[105:41.67]But some of them are so goddamn funny.
[105:43.85]They're so funny that I think it deserves a stream night.
[105:53.34]Okay, I always get a... What's that?
[105:58.85]Oh, those are bugs.
[106:17.03]Didn't I just burn this whole room?
[106:30.13]I thought I burnt this room.
[106:38.52]Why is there blood?
[106:39.32]I don't think it's blood.
[106:40.32]I think it's, um... Rust or something.
[106:49.65]Alright, this looks fine.
[106:50.90]I'm now... Look, look at the passion here, you see?
[106:55.08]See the passion here?
[107:16.52]There's no natural light.
[107:19.16]I'm going to put windows in, first of all.
[107:23.47]Nope.
[107:24.41]Don't want one of those in the house.
[107:34.79]Front door.
[107:35.41]Okay, is this the front door?
[107:36.75]Oh, that's the side door.
[107:39.23]Oops.
[107:43.37]Yeah, all of this wood needs to change.
[107:47.88]Yeah, this looks horrible.
[107:54.58]Ceiling fan phobia.
[107:55.86]I really do.
[107:56.94]They're weird.
[107:58.10]I really don't like them.
[107:59.04]They're weird.
[108:07.24]No, we're doing it from scratch.
[108:09.28]We're building this house from scratch.
[108:23.58]Alright, how do I want this to play out here?
[108:25.44]Alright, take all these walls down.
[108:29.04]We're building the house from scratch.
[108:49.33]Where's the dog?
[108:51.81]I don't know.
[108:52.41]I think at the other house.
[108:55.85]Holy shit, that was inside my head.
[109:00.87]This is a load-bearing wall.
[109:18.42]Jerry, these are load-bearing walls.
[109:20.24]Wait, are you doing a Seinfeld thing where they build a house or something?
[109:27.41]I feel like, wait, didn't this happen in Drake and Josh?
[109:34.50]No, it's a load-bearing wall, Josh!
[109:38.68]Was I supposed to?
[109:39.58]They really are, Jerry and fucking George.
[109:48.93]What the fu- I'm just realizing this right now.
[109:58.03]How was I supposed to know that a door was supposed to be there, Josh?
[110:02.94]No, other one.
[110:03.48]Other way around.
[110:05.92]There's supposed to be a door over there!
[110:08.08]That's George.
[110:09.90]Holy shit.
[110:19.11]Damn, okay.
[110:28.76]He knows too much.
[110:34.78]I want another Seinfeld episode.
[110:36.26]You know what I was thinking?
[110:42.94]In a hundred years, will... I know that, okay, like, media has a tendency to kind of repeat itself, right?
[110:49.98]Are we gonna see in 50 to 100 years just Seinfeld, but they're just kind of redoing it?
[110:58.80]Will there be a Breaking Bad remake in 50 years?
[111:12.19]Do you think so?
[111:13.27]I wonder.
[111:15.37]I'm actually genuinely curious about that.
[111:20.70]All the most popular media right now, will they redo it?
[111:26.02]I mean, Seinfeld ended 20 years ago, though.
[111:28.44]I think, I don't know.
[111:30.94]Maybe like another 50 years?
[111:35.14]But would they call it Seinfeld and just have some guy that's not Jerry Seinfeld just be pretending to be Jerry Seinfeld?
[111:53.59]They're just gonna call it Jerry Seinfeld.
[112:02.29]Okay, I want this to be... Trust me when I say, why are you taking all the rooms out?
[112:05.35]I'm not.
[112:21.09]When are you gonna get remade?
[112:24.39]See, I'm a... Well, see, I'm doing all of Jim Carrey's sound effects.
[112:28.90]So, like, I already am a remake.
[112:32.58]You know what I mean?
[112:43.67]Like, I am essentially a three sto- stooges.
[112:46.75]Why can't I- I can't talk when loud sounds are exploding in my head.
[112:55.12]I mean, I'm sort of- I am, like, one of the stooges, or all of them combined, maybe.
[113:00.12]Sometimes I feel like Moe.
[113:01.20]Sometimes I feel like, uh,
[113:05.01]Like, um... Not Gary.
[113:08.83]Uh, Curly.
[113:09.93]Sometimes I wake up and feel like one of the Stooges each day.
[113:15.65]Each day.
[113:25.78]I prefer... I prefer... The remake...
[113:35.92]You're the fourth stooge.
[113:42.69]Okay, so let's get rid of this.
[113:48.49]I need some light in here, because this is... Where even am I?
[113:51.99]Where's the door?
[113:52.53]Oh, no!
[113:55.99]Drake, you forgot to put the door on!
[113:58.47]Actually, where's the door?
[114:03.13]Oh, I fucking deleted it right.
[114:06.27]I forgot.
[114:20.56]Where are the stairs?
[114:23.90]Where is there a door?
[114:24.70]Okay, this is temporary.
[114:29.44]Where did it go?
[114:30.08]Oh!
[114:48.91]Ow.
[114:51.31]What?
[114:51.69]What the fuck just happened?
[114:56.24]Oh my goodness.
[114:59.02]Somebody punched me in the face.
[115:00.64]I got punched in the face.
[115:05.38]Why is it fucking Walgreens now?
[115:08.32]Alright, just whatever.
[115:09.56]I am very, very stunned right now.
[115:19.36]That just stunned me.
[115:20.56]That actually stunned me.
[115:21.88]I hope everyone's alright.
[115:25.00]Let's get some lights in here.
[115:29.43]Jesus.
[115:30.93]What the fuck?
[115:35.95]Why is caps lock on?
[115:39.83]Oh, okay.
[115:44.51]I just need a light.
[115:54.21]Pools?
[115:54.85]No.
[115:55.25]What the fuck is this?
[115:56.45]Stop!
[115:57.33]I'm concussed!
[115:58.88]Here we go.
[116:00.36]Just temporary.
[116:01.22]Just to get light in here.
[116:01.96]Where's the light switch?
[116:08.14]Turn it on.
[116:17.87]There we go.
[116:18.45]Now I can see.
[116:18.89]Alright, let's keep going.
[116:28.46]I don't know where I want the bathrooms yet.
[116:30.16]We'll get that figured out.
[116:31.60]Relax!
[116:45.09]I am getting blocked by this, aren't I?
[116:46.90]It's alright.
[116:48.24]Whatever.
[116:48.42]Alright, hopefully this doesn't explode anymore.
[117:03.28]Okay.
[117:05.54]Oof!
[117:12.81]I cannot take this wall down.
[117:14.05]This is a load-bearing wall.
[117:17.39]You're ruining your house.
[117:18.87]I am not even beginning.
[117:20.69]I have not even started.
[117:21.67]Okay.
[117:29.01]Good.
[117:30.29]Beginning.
[117:30.97]Beginning.
[117:35.48]Okay.
[117:37.08]Um, clean.
[117:39.20]Let's get this situated.
[117:42.76]Clean this shit up.
[117:45.40]Hmm.
[117:47.17]Take care of that.
[117:47.71]Okay.
[117:52.89]Let's make this look like less of a haunted house and more of a animal sanctuary.
[117:58.84]Animal foster home or something, right?
[118:04.37]rid of that okay get rid of that and get rid of this and get rid of these I don't want that alright what this is down to the other floor okay we're gonna keep should we get the bugs downstairs I want where should the bugs be where should I put all the bugs alright we'll do the bugs later
[118:30.95]First of all, I need a bedroom, so we're gonna have the bedroom be... This is the front door.
[118:37.12]Is this the front door?
[118:37.94]Where the hell am I?
[118:41.52]This is the... Okay.
[118:44.23]This is where the front door is supposed to be.
[118:47.95]Right here.
[118:49.59]I'll take care of that right now.
[118:59.81]Turn your... turn your sound down.
[119:04.19]Same shit's gonna happen.
[119:08.34]Turn your sound down.
[119:09.82]I mean it.
[119:15.22]Thank God I did that.
[119:21.69]Thank God.
[119:23.87]That was almost a disaster.
[119:32.16]There's the front door.
[119:33.32]It's temporary.
[119:33.98]Don't worry.
[119:34.42]Everyone calling me shitty front door Andy.
[119:37.10]I've seen those comments and I... This is greasy.
[119:55.87]I can't fix it.
[120:05.58]That's really greasy.
[120:10.32]Is it still greasy?
[120:14.45]This shit is greasy.
[120:15.41]Alright, let's clean.
[120:24.06]I know.
[120:24.96]Every time... These steaks, they're not greasy.
[120:32.33]And just, right when you go to the pizza shop, be careful.
[120:35.19]The pizza's greasy.
[120:48.92]How fast can you do that?
[120:49.70]Get the fuck out of here.
[121:00.04]No one can compare.
[121:01.32]Not one person.
[121:04.86]I dominate that market.
[121:12.33]Okay.
[121:14.17]Let's do it.
[121:17.21]I need to figure out where I want to put my room.
[121:20.42]There's no upstairs.
[121:22.62]I think my... So this is the front door.
[121:24.04]That's technically the back door.
[121:25.54]That could be a little living room area.
[121:30.12]This front door, you come in.
[121:32.69]Maybe like right over here.
[121:36.36]I'm going to say I want my bedroom to be right here.
[121:40.64]Like right here.
[121:46.66]Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[121:51.55]So let's say from here, we can just put like a fucking weird clock here or something, right?
[122:29.72]Fuck.
[122:49.59]This is the front door.
[122:50.52]I don't, okay.
[122:51.52]This is the front door.
[122:53.04]Bedroom is gonna be right here.
[122:54.00]Right here.
[123:02.63]That looks good to me.
[123:03.63]Right there.
[123:19.83]Make a little hallway.
[123:21.97]Shut up!
[123:22.75]I'm working on it!
[123:23.45]Okay.
[123:41.97]So you come in.
[123:43.64]This is a little hallway.
[123:44.70]There'll be a little, maybe a closet right here.
[123:47.64]Yeah.
[123:58.01]But should I have the bedroom entrance be here?
[124:03.48]Or right here?
[124:08.97]I feel like the door being right there would be weird, wouldn't it?
[124:10.83]This is kind of a hallway, then this could be the entrance right here.
[124:14.84]Yeah, I think that makes more sense.
[124:18.24]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[124:25.59]Looks good.
[124:28.35]Put a window in there?
[124:28.97]Yeah, I will.
[124:34.16]This is fine for a bedroom.
[124:35.82]Look, I just need to sleep and wake up and have a light.
[124:39.38]And have, like, a painting.
[124:40.24]And that's it.
[124:40.58]I don't care about anything else.
[124:43.57]I need a bedroom door.
[124:44.49]Ooh.
[124:50.99]Okay.
[124:52.53]What's a decent door for the bedroom?
[124:59.01]Is it refrigerators?
[125:03.46]Okay, this is fine.
[125:10.93]What color should the door be?
[125:12.19]Um, how about... Like a beige?
[125:20.08]Like a birch?
[125:25.66]Is it front doors?
[125:26.56]Oh my god.
[125:27.58]Does it really matter though?
[125:41.01]Luxury.
[125:42.90]Pets.
[125:45.04]These are the new ones.
[125:46.18]Let's get some new ones.
[125:48.80]Okay, interior door.
[125:50.02]Here you go.
[125:50.50]This one looks fine.
[125:59.35]Maybe like a nice cedar?
[126:00.35]Yeah, that looks fine.
[126:14.28]Okay.
[126:18.25]Okay, move, please.
[126:19.03]Thank you.
[126:19.31]Looks good.
[126:26.69]Now we have to build the little things up here.
[126:32.33]This game is so relaxing.
[126:33.51]Where's the passion?
[126:35.11]You don't see the passion in my voice right here?
[126:40.33]I'm working on it.
[126:41.63]This is just... I want a ton of room for the animals.
[126:44.75]No window.
[126:47.73]God, I gotta be at lightning speed, apparently.
[127:01.82]Where's the bed gonna go?
[127:03.94]We'll do, like, one here.
[127:06.09]And... One... Wait.
[127:07.99]Wait.
[127:09.43]How do I... Oh.
[127:12.67]Okay, there's the window.
[127:14.44]Put two windows in here.
[127:21.30]There it is.
[127:23.33]Nice.
[127:23.55]Alright, that looks fine.
[127:24.91]The walls aren't going to look like this.
[127:26.73]Don't worry.
[127:29.21]In fact, let's figure that out now.
[127:30.19]Let me get some good lighting.
[127:47.25]Okay, lights.
[127:49.17]Ooh.
[127:50.82]Although, I should probably have some cool stuff in here.
[127:54.30]Why are the walls two feet thick?
[127:58.70]Because that's the way they made the game, okay?
[128:01.14]I didn't do that.
[128:04.06]Should I have some weird shit?
[128:13.61]Aww.
[128:13.81]Aww.
[128:25.20]Does this thing look cool?
[128:43.86]That's fine.
[128:46.04]Get a dog.
[128:47.00]I need to have this place be available.
[128:49.02]I need to be okay to have a dog or a cat or a rabbit or a horse or a tarantula or an iguana.
[128:55.46]I'm not just gonna bring him in here.
[128:56.60]It's dangerous.
[128:58.32]It's really off-center.
[128:59.08]I just need the light.
[128:59.66]Alright, floor.
[129:01.52]Carpet.
[129:02.44]Definitely carpets.
[129:06.10]Ooh.
[129:17.13]How's this look?
[129:19.21]Looks nice.
[129:21.01]I like carpets.
[129:24.41]I like carpets up in a bedroom.
[129:26.72]I like carpets down in a bedroom.
[129:28.16]I like in a bedroom.
[129:28.92]I don't know how many times I have to say that for you to get it.
[129:34.06]It's comfortable.
[129:35.08]It feels nice on your feet.
[129:38.42]It gets really nice and warm and stuff.
[129:42.74]I don't get this carpet hatred that everybody seems to have.
[129:48.02]Alright, walls.
[129:48.92]What do I want this to be?
[129:49.66]I don't care if my bedroom is small.
[129:52.50]I want more room for the animals.
[130:02.69]Um, yeah.
[130:05.17]Really?
[130:05.79]Like I'm not going to do that?
[130:25.51]Cool.
[130:29.75]But wait, check this out.
[130:31.71]People are going to be very... No, I'm not going to burn it down.
[130:56.82]Okay.
[130:59.36]He's making a pet sanctuary.
[131:00.80]That's what I'm doing.
[131:01.92]That's the pet DLC.
[131:03.10]Of course I'm going to make a big pet sanctuary.
[131:04.87]What are you, out of your mind?
[131:07.61]But here's the design.
[131:08.33]This is where the design comes in.
[131:10.73]Watch this.
[131:12.97]Check this out, everybody.
[131:19.86]Okay, watch this.
[131:20.94]Here we go.
[131:27.67]Uh-huh.
[131:38.80]There we go!
[131:39.36]Now it... Looks like an old Nickelodeon ad.
[131:46.20]Eh, it doesn't work.
[131:50.12]Oh, I hate it.
[131:51.84]Just an accent wall.
[131:52.56]Okay, I'll do... Yeah.
[131:55.30]Something else.
[131:56.82]Yeah, I hate it.
[131:58.53]We'll just do paint.
[131:59.13]We'll keep that as the accent wall, though.
[132:00.59]What should I paint it?
[132:01.21]Crystal?
[132:02.65]The Milky Way?
[132:05.27]Let's try the Milky Way.
[132:16.84]Is it ugly?
[132:21.96]Too plain?
[132:25.87]It's a little too plain.
[132:28.62]Yeah, too plain.
[132:33.92]I don't want to go too crazy, though.
[132:37.65]How about morning celadon?
[132:41.53]Fresh morning.
[132:44.57]Fresh morning would probably be good here.
[132:47.83]Let's test it.
[132:52.92]I like it.
[132:54.30]I think it goes with the, uh, with the accent.
[133:04.89]Oh yeah, this'll work fine.
[133:11.93]Yeah, for sure.
[133:25.30]It's the same thing.
[133:26.30]It's not the same thing, it's...
[133:29.28]That's not... Look at it under the light.
[133:31.04]That's not the same thing.
[133:32.48]This is way nicer.
[133:33.62]I am a shadow in the dark, okay?
[133:37.79]I need to... Hold on a second.
[133:50.34]Hi.

[134:07.21]There we go.
[134:09.39]Alright, yeah!
[134:12.59]Much, much better.
[134:25.32]It's just gray.
[134:26.64]I'm gonna change the carpet so it's not so boring, but I'm very boring!
[134:32.05]I swear to God, people think I might be making this up.
[134:35.13]Like, oh man, I bet you he has, like, really crazy taste.
[134:38.31]I bet you he has wicked expensive taste and shit.
[134:40.21]He probably has, like, a chandelier in his house.
[134:42.31]Guys, I would be so happy.
[134:45.25]At my most happiness.
[134:47.95]Just sitting, like, in a bedroom that just has a bed, a table, and a lamp on it.
[134:54.07]I don't care.
[134:56.15]You know what I mean?
[134:57.05]That's at my most happy.
[134:59.23]I don't want a bunch of shit in the way.
[135:00.81]I don't want a bunch of stuff everywhere.
[135:04.85]All I need is, yeah, I need my iPad.
[135:07.36]Sitting here on my chest.
[135:09.64]A bed.
[135:10.08]A light.
[135:17.36]And good company.
[135:27.79]This door looks like shit.
[135:30.31]You're an iPad kid.
[135:31.77]No, I'm not an iPad kid.
[135:54.29]Sometimes Holly will take a funny picture because I fall asleep a lot
[136:01.09]When I'm with my iPad on my chest.
[136:13.08]In the pictures I'm about to show you, I am asleep.
[136:18.28]Asleep.
[136:25.45]And one of these in particular is really funny.
[136:28.25]Hold on.
[136:39.10]This happens all the fucking time.
[136:42.34]I just sit there.
[136:42.92]I have this little thing that sits on my chest.
[136:50.86]Let's go through a couple of these.
[136:52.36]Maybe one or two of them.
[136:57.64]Okay, hold on.
[136:58.40]Let me make sure I can get this on screen.
[137:11.55]this is a picture of me this is the kind I don't know what I was even watching autoplay just takes over guys a lot a lot of the time okay that's me asleep be aware of that I am asleep and apparently I'm watching free money to quit your job I don't know where this came from
[137:40.30]Getting rich on government money.
[137:44.83]I was sleeping.
[137:50.21]It gets better, though.
[137:51.19]It does get better.
[137:52.03]I promise that this does get a little better.
[137:54.49]And I'm going to show you another one.
[138:06.28]Don't be... Nobody freak out about this, okay?
[138:09.14]But it's too funny to not show.
[138:15.13]It really is too funny to not show this.
[138:29.83]This is...
[138:46.19]and I I just fall asleep to stuff and I watch stuff it could be anything there's more there's more there's more of these
[139:15.39]There's one of... Here's the other one.
[139:19.65]I think this is from the same video, but it's just funny.
[139:28.11]Guys, I'm telling you, I will fall asleep to shit and just it'll be on for six hours and I will absorb it.
[139:34.68]I've fallen asleep to six hours.
[139:37.32]Oh my God, what a perfect opportunity to talk about this.
[139:40.12]So today, what I fell asleep to as an iPad Kid Andy...
[139:44.80]Fell asleep to I don't know was a food eating video one of those videos we were eating food and I I guess I fell asleep and I woke I kind of woke up because Otto was in the bed and I heard like Crunching shit and I'm like Otto's eating something.
[140:03.68]What's he eating?
[140:05.05]No, he's not what's he getting into and I opened my eyes and look at the dog and he's fine He's just sitting there sleeping and the audio stopped and
[140:12.53]But there were no more eating sounds.
[140:16.56]So I was like, what the fuck was that?
[140:18.48]I must have been having like a weird dream.
[140:21.32]So I didn't care and I went back to bed.
[140:23.78]And I heard it again.
[140:25.78]I heard this crazy eating sounds.
[140:27.40]And I'm like, Otto's getting into like the trash.
[140:29.73]What's happening?
[140:30.45]And no, it was over here.
[140:32.35]The iPad was on the other end of the bed.
[140:35.11]Just Otto playing shit.
[140:37.59]And I kept thinking it was Otto eating food in the bed.
[140:43.67]had to have been going on for at least four or five hours because it was dark when it happened the first time and the sun was shining the second time I don't know what the is wrong with me I don't know what I what's I don't know why I keep doing this but it doesn't matter it could be anything the youtube recommendation autoplay is terrible
[141:11.73]Here's another one.
[141:12.41]We'll do this last one.
[141:13.61]I think this is from the quit your job for money thing.
[141:34.76]By the way, if you want to know who that is, that's Matthew Lesko.
[141:39.77]Who, he's actually like a really, really nice guy.
[141:42.00]Really, really like awesome, awesome dude.
[141:44.04]Really just wanted to like help people and shit.
[141:46.10]He's a great person.
[141:47.10]That, that little documentary that Vice did is wonderful.
[141:49.52]I really recommend you watch it.
[141:51.00]I've seen it.
[141:52.32]I didn't fall asleep to it.
[141:53.44]I've seen it.
[141:55.43]It's, he's actually, he was actually a really, really good guy.
[141:58.05]Alright.
[142:04.11]You have a broken neck?
[142:09.94]I'm propped up on a pillow man that's not a TV there's an iPad you have streamer neck in you asleep
[142:36.00]Sometimes though, that's dangerous because I will be like this and I'll move a certain way and the iPad will go and start falling down and I'll feel it and I'll be like, and I'll grab it and, okay.
[142:49.44]And then I leave it there and I go back to bed.
[142:50.97]It's move it, just move it off of your fucking body.
[142:54.91]I do that three or four times a night.
[142:57.47]I almost get smashed in the mouth by my iPad and I don't care.
[143:01.95]I put it right back where it was.
[143:05.34]One of these days, it's going to knock out one of my front teeth.
[143:11.51]Anyways.
[143:20.81]This is too funny.
[143:21.81]I had to share it.
[143:26.87]Ceiling is still wood.
[143:28.21]I'm working on it.
[143:36.30]Okay.
[143:37.10]So.
[143:50.33]Is this real?
[143:55.19]Is this a real?
[143:56.21]Holly, is this real?
[143:58.11]Is this a real one?
[144:02.15]Is this real?
[144:05.91]I don't think this is... Did I fall asleep to this?
[144:09.53]I might have.
[144:10.27]I don't know.
[144:10.67]I really don't know.
[144:12.43]I don't know.
[144:13.33]I truly don't know.
[144:15.81]Why is this image so huge?
[144:27.86]What the fuck?
[144:28.58]Where is it?
[144:33.62]I'm so confused.
[144:37.17]Oh, there we go.
[144:37.67]Okay.
[144:41.61]I may, I might have, I actually might have.
[144:44.49]This could be a real photo.
[144:48.14]I really probably did.
[144:49.20]Oh, it's not real.
[144:51.16]It could be.
[144:52.08]It actually could be.
[144:55.68]This is no way.
[144:57.20]That's edited.
[144:57.98]It's fake.
[144:58.48]Okay.
[144:58.68]But it's definitely real because I've definitely fallen asleep watching that video.
[145:03.53]I'm not even kidding.
[145:06.01]Sometimes those eating videos, I just watch one and I go, whoa, what this is?
[145:10.53]Whoa.
[145:11.27]And then I just... And they all play.
[145:22.02]It's real.
[145:26.62]I'm serious.
[145:27.42]I don't know.
[145:27.94]I'm very weird when it comes to media and consuming media.
[145:32.43]A lot of people are probably like, dude, what the fuck?
[145:34.13]Why are you doing that?
[145:34.81]What's wrong with you?
[145:36.01]I don't know.
[145:37.13]I like watching odd media, just like interesting stuff.
[145:41.29]I don't watch TV shows.
[145:43.15]I watched four straight hours of ASMR eating videos.
[145:47.69]I don't, just because, because it's, it's very, it's fascinating.
[145:50.67]It's interesting to me.
[145:52.23]It's interesting.
[145:54.65]I will watch like four hours of log cutting videos.
[145:58.17]It's just, it's fascinating somehow.
[146:00.49]It's very interesting.
[146:03.07]You know what I'm saying?
[146:05.49]It's ADHD that's doing it.
[146:06.23]It could be.
[146:08.79]It actually could be.
[146:09.39]Alright, can I paint the ceiling, please?
[146:19.45]It can just be this.
[146:20.55]This is fine.
[146:25.36]Now you could paint a wall.
[146:26.38]Good.
[146:30.68]Is this the wrong color?
[146:31.40]No.
[146:32.75]Is this too weird looking?
[146:34.59]I can't tell.
[146:35.01]I love doing interior car cleaning videos.
[146:39.85]Yeah!
[146:42.37]You don't have to watch, you know, the new season of Breaking Bad or whatever.
[146:49.84]We're just... I like watching random shit.
[146:54.94]I will watch old commercials.
[146:59.04]It's interesting.
[147:00.42]Really old commercials.
[147:05.92]I'm happy with this room.
[147:07.04]I'm done with it.
[147:09.26]Okay, now I need a bathroom, which would be right here.
[147:17.19]You missed a spot.
[147:17.87]I can go do finishing touches later.
[147:26.87]Bathroom can be here.
[147:28.29]Ooh, the door isn't going to be closed, isn't it?
[147:29.73]It's fine.
[147:31.93]It's fine.
[147:34.81]Change the weird door.
[147:35.79]That is a fucking weird door.
[147:41.46]I know, you're right.
[147:42.00]That is a weird door.
[147:53.99]Maybe I could just have, like, an open concept here.
[147:59.19]It's probably... It's gotta be here instead.
[148:07.68]right there there it is okay so the bathroom's right here open concept into a bedroom I don't know it's just gonna be it's gonna be me and all my dogs and lizards and I think right right there should be fine that should be fine right here I think what does your youtube recommended look like it's a it's crazy
[148:32.56]I actually have to go in and delete all of my search history and watch history because eventually it gets to be fucking nightmares.
[148:42.63]It's just crazy the recommendations I get.
[148:46.49]If I don't reset it, it's just all over the place.

[149:34.75]It's freaking me out because I'm not embarrassed by like something weird showing up.
[149:39.73]I'm embarrassed by the volume of eating videos that are going to be there.
[149:44.41]And I, that's kind of, I don't, I don't know if I like that.
[149:48.10]The volume of like people eating or like drinking liquids really fast.

[159:13.80]How did this get even louder?
[159:19.04]I don't know how that got so loud.
[159:23.81]Okay.
[159:24.85]So, let's continue.
[159:26.61]This is going to be the bathroom.
[159:28.39]Very quickly.
[159:29.91]Very quickly.
[159:31.79]Let's get it done.
[159:39.22]Let's get it done.
[159:48.21]Bathroom.
[159:49.47]Right here.
[159:54.19]It's fine.
[159:54.81]It doesn't need to be big.
[159:55.61]I just need it to exist.
[159:56.61]I don't care.
[159:57.57]I'm not going to watch the video right now.
[160:18.39]Give it a rest.
[160:21.03]Okay.
[160:22.07]This goes to the bedroom.
[160:22.99]This is going to go to the bathroom right here.
[160:27.53]There it is.
[160:29.49]Excellent.
[160:34.77]Looking good.
[160:35.31]It's a small bathroom, but it doesn't need to be large.
[160:39.11]This needs to be small enough or big enough to go in there and do whatever you need to do.
[160:43.59]And then here we go.
[160:44.51]This is where the iguana is going to live.
[160:54.86]The drawers can be replaced later.
[160:55.96]I don't care if they're ugly.
[160:56.66]They just have to exist.
[160:57.42]I don't care.
[161:03.23]Oh, my eyes are so irritated.
[161:04.23]Why are my eyes so irritated?
[161:07.29]There's just a lot of irritation right now.
[161:08.53]Looks good.
[161:14.05]Yeah, it looks fine.
[161:15.40]Alright, speaking of in the bathroom... My eyes are so itchy.
[161:24.92]Alright.
[161:25.61]I need floors.
[161:28.53]We'll do the walls first.
[161:30.13]What's a nice bathroom one?
[161:31.27]How about... I don't know.
[161:32.65]Green.
[161:33.27]Let's go.
[161:33.83]Let's get wild with it.

[161:37.77]Why not?
[161:39.29]Should we get wild with it?
[161:45.10]Green?
[161:50.48]Let's get wild with it.
[162:13.68]Alright, this is some Wizard of Oz Munchkin Land shit.
[162:23.73]Should I leave it?
[162:29.63]Oh, Emerald City.
[162:30.31]That's what I was thinking of.
[162:31.21]Wasn't it Munchkin Land as well?
[162:32.83]It was all that green, wasn't it?
[162:35.50]Emerald City, not Munchkin Land.
[162:41.68]It's a Yoda bathroom.
[162:47.58]I think it should be.
[162:48.24]If I put... Whatever.
[162:50.06]I'm sticking with it.
[162:51.04]I second-guessed too much.
[162:51.88]Okay.

[163:22.24]Okay.
[163:31.97]Let's make this a little nicer looking.
[163:33.53]The ceiling should be... Let's just make it white.
[163:46.91]Put some nice lights in here too.
[163:57.84]Okay.
[164:01.57]Get rid of that.

[168:21.54]Alright, that's fine.
[168:22.34]Let's go.
[168:24.10]No bathtub.
[168:24.86]I don't need a bathtub.
[168:30.68]Did you actually put lemon juice in your eye?
[168:35.24]Where'd I get the lemon juice from?
[168:36.74]This is kind of lemony.
[168:46.06]It's kind of lemony.
[168:46.78]Okay, shower.
[168:53.89]Say it with me now.
[168:55.50]Ooh!
[169:14.91]None of you are fucking gonna do it?

[169:19.58]That's surprising.
[169:29.19]Okay, there's the shower.
[169:30.87]That looks fine.
[169:31.61]Let's watch out for the door.
[169:34.55]What is this?
[169:35.53]Oh, a toilet needs to go here.
[169:40.95]Toilet.
[169:42.29]Okay.
[169:42.77]Suspended toilet.
[169:47.15]I was like, is this a toilet?
[169:55.51]Standing toilet paper.
[170:00.30]Alright, how about this one?
[170:09.56]Okay.
[170:10.78]Now I just need a sink.
[170:11.77]I need some toilet paper.
[170:18.69]There.
[170:23.75]See?
[170:24.01]Okay.
[170:24.85]Now I need a sink and a mirror.
[170:26.71]And a painting.
[170:27.03]Okay.
[170:31.06]I need a... Wait.
[170:32.04]I need a mountable sink.
[170:41.10]Ugh!
[170:46.66]Right there.
[170:47.08]Why am I so itchy?
[170:53.19]Rotate the shower?
[170:54.01]You can do that in your game.
[170:54.75]Alright, I need a mountable sink.
[171:02.37]Ooh, I like that.
[171:04.81]I like this one.
[171:06.25]I like that kind of basin style.
[171:18.69]The water always comes out of these really cool.
[171:22.30]Let me see if I can describe.
[171:23.26]You know what I mean?
[171:23.68]When it's like, it's this weird, there's no bubbles in the water.
[171:30.21]It's just this really see-through stream.
[171:33.97]Do you know what I'm talking about?
[171:35.49]When you turn on a faucet and it goes... It's called laminar flow?
[171:44.26]Yeah.
[171:46.16]What is that called?
[171:46.73]Because I want it.
[171:48.61]Laminar flow.
[171:50.01]Okay.
[171:50.63]I want that.
[171:51.17]I love that so much.
[171:52.75]It's like my favorite thing in the world.
[172:02.74]There are microplastics in it.
[172:04.00]Okay.
[172:07.90]I... I don't have one.
[172:18.77]There are microplastics all over your body right now.
[172:23.17]Well, get them off!
[172:23.89]I don't want them on me.
[172:25.67]Put a trash can in here.
[172:26.49]Yep.
[172:33.00]This looks fine.
[172:42.80]There, now I just need a painting.
[172:43.70]I need a bathroom painting.
[172:54.22]Like a lemon.
[172:56.65]I just need a lemon.
[172:58.37]Something lemony.
[173:03.96]Something lemony.
[173:06.32]It's kind of lemony.
[173:15.18]That one's the most lemony, I think.
[173:21.91]This one looks pretty lemony, I think.
[173:25.13]This one.
[173:28.53]This one.
[173:28.73]It's way too fucking big.
[173:34.31]Jesus, why are these so huge?
[173:38.01]Okay, now we need a mirror.
[173:46.45]Just a basic one?
[173:48.11]Oh, alright.
[173:50.03]I like that.
[173:51.50]Bigger than that, though.
[173:57.20]Is it too high?
[173:57.66]Is that too low?
[174:04.87]Okay, that's fine.
[174:06.11]Look at that.
[174:07.91]The bathroom is done, and it's a beautiful one.
[174:10.19]I need a little rug.
[174:16.47]This one's lemony.
[174:20.99]Oh, and I don't know anything about design.
[174:22.78]I don't know anything about how the world works.
[174:26.14]Look at that.
[174:27.68]Take a look.
[174:30.07]That's a nice bathroom.
[174:31.89]It's fine.
[174:32.47]There's nothing wrong with it.
[174:33.39]Oh, but we need to rotate the shower.
[174:35.41]Start banning them.
[174:41.42]Okay, so that's cool.
[174:43.60]Now we can start to think about where I want the animals to be.
[174:47.22]Here's the front door.
[174:48.10]Okay, front door.
[174:51.48]Coming in here.
[174:54.09]What do I want the painting on the walls to be?
[174:57.01]And is there going to be another room?
[174:59.23]I think so.
[174:59.67]Alright.
[174:59.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[175:01.39]Watch.
[175:01.59]Let's get rid of this.
[175:14.76]So that's the bathroom.
[175:15.94]This is the bedroom.
[175:18.18]And then I need... This will be a nice enclosure here.
[175:21.04]Right here.
[175:22.66]Yep.
[175:25.00]I can maybe do some fish tanks and shit.
[175:27.62]I am so ready.
[175:28.32]This is going to be so fun.
[175:29.52]Are you guys ready?
[175:29.96]It's going to be so fun.
[175:30.65]It's going to be so cool.
[175:33.33]Okay, so the wall should be there.
[175:36.17]We'll go straight across from here to there.
[175:50.60]What's wrong?
[175:57.68]And my axe and my bow.
[175:59.98]And my axe and my bow.
[176:04.08]Activate sleeper agent.
[176:05.18]Code onion ring.
[176:10.67]Whatever.
[176:10.97]Okay.
[176:14.25]I need the walls again.
[176:18.53]Onion ring.
[176:28.26]It's actually kind of fun and funny.
[176:31.03]That I will... I will... You know, spend... Hundreds of thousands of dollars on shows.
[176:40.37]And the biggest memes that come out of this channel... Is like, I found an onion ring in my french fries.
[176:47.50]And I'm the guy from the Among Us sus guy.
[176:53.28]I'm the serial killer AI guy.
[176:58.06]That's so funny.
[177:10.10]They're uneven?
[177:11.40]I'm fixing it right now.
[177:14.91]But they have to be uneven because I want it to be flush to the door here.
[177:17.59]It doesn't have to be flush to the door.
[177:20.25]Okay, that's actually annoying.
[177:23.83]It can be flush with this.
[177:25.09]So, whatever.
[177:25.65]Okay.
[177:42.50]Okay, so this now can go here.
[177:45.48]Because I want this to be the wall.
[177:47.74]This is going to be our first enclosure.
[177:50.77]Here we go.
[177:52.41]Let's go.
[177:53.29]Here we go.
[177:53.93]Let's do it.
[177:56.95]Alright.
[177:58.37]So what should I put in here?
[178:00.03]I'm wondering.
[178:01.03]What do you guys think?
[178:08.40]I need lights, first of all.
[178:14.76]the fuck is that chickens um what can you actually put in here I just want a lamp there's a cat treadmill I just want lights okay ceiling lamps just something basic for now I can play with it later
[178:40.50]Just basic.
[178:41.56]Basic just to get light in here.
[178:43.46]It doesn't have to be exact.
[178:44.38]Everyone's going to be pissed that they're not lined up correctly.
[178:47.12]It's just to get light in here.
[178:48.48]Okay.
[178:53.16]So this is animal room one.
[178:58.45]Let's see what I want to do here.
[179:00.03]Pets.
[179:01.99]Well and freshwater aquarium.
[179:04.67]Snake terrarium.
[179:05.71]Should I do some snakes?
[179:07.31]What should be up here?
[179:07.87]Birds?
[179:08.43]Birds?
[179:15.45]Hamsters?
[179:17.83]Just do a bunch of reptiles.
[179:20.55]Spider terrarium?
[179:21.43]Spiders will go downstairs.
[179:26.71]Okay.
[179:27.81]Let's do a bunch of iguanas and lizards.
[179:29.45]Alright, let's do lizards.
[179:35.65]This thing is huge.
[179:38.88]This thing is actually too big.
[179:42.28]No, it's not.
[179:43.80]Alright, here's our iguana terrarium.
[179:46.44]It fits perfectly in this spot.
[179:49.10]I can put some little decorations around it.
[179:58.88]Nice.
[179:59.38]Okay.
[180:03.60]Buy two to fill the wall.
[180:04.82]I don't think two will fit.
[180:07.00]Alright, now we can do like a snake and a snake.
[180:11.56]What other small reptiles can we do?
[180:14.51]We can do aquarium.
[180:15.65]What about, yeah, snakes maybe.
[180:23.32]Oh yeah, we can do four.
[180:24.62]Alright, let me put this on a counter.
[180:25.66]Is there like a table or a counter or something?
[180:31.12]That I can build it on top of?
[180:38.66]Do a turtle?
[180:40.18]Well, let's do snakes over here and then turtles over there.
[180:47.21]Do I have access to a snake?
[180:48.72]Or do I have access to a turtle?
[180:52.24]Hamster.
[180:55.26]Where's turtle?
[180:56.90]Turtle's not here.
[180:57.98]Oh, there we go.
[180:58.48]Okay.
[181:00.41]How big is this?
[181:01.61]Alright, this is huge.
[181:04.45]Can it just sit on the ground?
[181:08.01]Right?
[181:08.41]It can just sit there, right?
[181:09.48]That's fine.
[181:09.78]Should I just do two turtles?
[181:11.28]Two turtles?
[181:14.42]Or should I do two snakes over here?
[181:15.74]Turtle, iguana, and two snakes?
[181:18.60]You look like a fish.
[181:21.29]Yeah, fucking whatever.
[181:28.85]I'll do two snakes.
[181:29.81]But they need to be up off the ground.
[181:34.43]What is it?
[181:34.67]Because my mouth goes like this?
[181:35.81]Because my mouth goes like that?
[181:38.93]My lips?
[181:40.23]I have like a fish mouth?
[181:42.07]Yeah, you don't think I know that?
[181:46.12]You don't think I have a mouth that goes too far this way?
[181:49.52]You don't think I've ever seen that before?
[181:50.96]You don't think I've never looked at that before?
[181:55.15]I can breathe underwater.
[181:57.45]You can't.
[182:02.57]What if I just lifted up my neck over here and there was just gills?
[182:05.31]Just like, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[182:08.29]Okay, Jim Carrey, settle down.
[182:09.77]Shit.
[182:16.26]Okay, I need a counter.
[182:21.94]This is probably big enough, right?
[182:23.88]I don't want it to be like that, though.
[182:37.49]Here we go.
[182:37.87]I think that's fine.
[182:47.37]That's kind of snake themed, isn't it?
[182:51.69]I need to be longer than that.
[182:59.10]There's a shorter one, right?
[183:11.04]Look at that.
[183:12.42]Perfect.
[183:21.33]Can I fit two?
[183:24.33]I can.
[183:25.31]No, I can't.
[183:26.35]Yes, I can.
[183:29.33]There we go.
[183:32.82]Okay, we got two snakes.
[183:34.14]I got a turtle and an iguana.
[183:37.40]Pretty cool.
[183:37.94]Alright.
[183:38.86]Now what?
[183:39.18]Actually, let's do this while I'm here.
[183:46.45]This room needs to be a little bit more inviting, too.
[183:48.01]What's your goal on the ground?
[183:54.48]I don't know what to put on the ground.
[183:55.48]What do you think?
[184:01.30]Put a snakeskin rug on the ground.
[184:06.63]Excuse me?
[184:07.03]Alright, I need to do... The walls are just so awful looking.
[184:20.85]Oh, let's go back to pets.
[184:21.61]What else is here?
[184:25.09]There's no bunnies in here.
[184:40.07]Don't do that.
[184:48.31]What is this?
[184:50.81]Holy shit.
[184:55.61]How do I get out of here?
[184:56.43]I'm stuck here.
[184:56.89]Mm-hmm.
[185:11.70]That's going right here.
[185:23.02]Oh my god, that's so annoyingly large.
[185:26.78]What are you supposed to do with this?
[185:31.56]What are you actually supposed to do with this?
[185:39.97]Why is this floating?
[185:50.35]Oh, it goes against the corner.
[185:51.65]Okay, what does this go to?
[185:54.39]Oh, fuck it.
[185:54.71]Whatever.
[185:54.91]I don't care.
[185:56.39]What does this go to?
[185:57.81]It's the bathroom shit.
[185:59.47]We can go over here.
[186:13.70]Okay.
[186:15.40]That works.
[186:19.14]What is that?
[186:19.74]It is a cat aggro crag.
[186:24.00]Come on.
[186:29.54]This is the bedroom.
[186:30.26]I'll do that later.
[186:33.46]Bathroom is fine.
[186:34.36]Alright, here's the... Let's go back in here.
[186:39.33]Take care of this.
[186:39.85]I need to do this.
[186:51.94]Where do you eat?
[186:53.08]I'll make a little kitchenette over here.
[186:55.32]Kitchenette can exist over there.
[186:56.72]I think it should be fine.
[187:17.47]I got 313,000 bucks.
[187:17.83]I'm fine.
[187:28.91]Get rid of this, too.
[187:29.61]I don't want this.
[187:42.89]Okay.
[187:43.81]Here's the back entrance.
[187:45.05]We're gonna do a little... We're gonna do a huge patio here, and there's gonna be a ton of play areas for the dogs, the cats.
[187:51.57]Just let me... How much does it cost to buy, like, 40 animals?
[187:55.59]Is it more than $300,000?
[188:02.41]It's probably a lot.
[188:03.57]Yeah, it's probably a lot.
[188:05.83]We're gonna find out.
[188:09.89]If I need to go sell the other house, I will.
[188:13.93]Okay.
[188:15.75]Back to this room.
[188:16.31]This is the reptile den.
[188:19.74]I gotta think of the night... If it's a reptile den, it's gonna be green.
[188:23.34]It's gonna be green, light green, dark green on the floor.
[188:28.10]Yeah.
[188:32.17]Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[188:34.09]It could be green.
[188:36.95]Green and brown.
[188:41.73]Let's just do some paint.
[188:47.60]Yeah, something like this.
[188:49.88]Strong green, maybe, for the walls?
[188:52.54]No, that's too dark.
[188:56.50]Here we go.
[188:56.94]How about, like, spring grass?
[188:58.98]Or ripe pear.
[188:59.72]We'll try spring grass.
[189:00.52]I feel like this is going to be it.
[189:03.84]My god, my eyeball is going to fall out of my head.
[189:05.78]Let's do a sample.
[189:13.15]I mean, it's the reptile room.
[189:17.97]That's what's happening.
[189:27.03]This is the reptile room.
[189:37.27]You smoked too much.
[189:41.99]No, I did not.
[189:46.08]I like that.
[189:46.56]That's cute.
[189:47.64]I can put some paintings up.
[189:48.66]We'll dress it up a little bit so it doesn't look so plain.
[189:51.96]It's too light.
[189:52.76]We'll dress it up, don't worry.
[190:02.00]No one's going to see this wall, so who cares?
[190:14.47]That's good.
[190:20.25]Paint it.
[190:22.43]Landlord special.
[190:23.77]Don't paint behind the furniture.
[190:25.53]I don't know.
[190:43.51]I feel like...
[190:45.53]If I was a landlord... I feel like I would be constantly... Just... Is everything okay over there?
[190:53.67]Things going good?
[190:55.81]Something break?
[190:56.55]Something need fixing?
[190:59.65]I would want it to be like really good over there.
[191:03.95]I don't understand that concept.
[191:10.67]I would be so concerned.
[191:18.92]You can't tell me this doesn't look good.
[191:30.94]I don't know, I was like, hey, uh, hey, my sink is broken, and I need someone to come fix it.
[191:37.35]I'd be like, you stay right there, I'll be over in five minutes, and I'd get out of my fucking pajamas and go over.
[191:43.53]I don't know, that's because, that's like, I want to make sure this shit's fucking taken care of.
[191:50.76]Do I own this property?
[191:52.12]If I own this fucking place, what, am I just going to hang up?
[191:59.96]Yeah, I don't care.
[192:01.12]Huh?
[192:01.48]What the fuck are you talking about?
[192:02.54]I'll be over there in five minutes.
[192:03.56]Okay, so that's the green.
[192:11.27]This is a nice green reptile room.
[192:22.65]They do do that.
[192:24.11]Could you fix it?
[192:25.05]I would get the appropriate person that could.
[192:27.63]Or try.
[192:28.07]They need to be dark.
[192:36.18]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[192:37.70]Actually, I kind of like this wood for the reptile room.
[192:41.60]Don't you?
[192:43.91]I think it's kind of like Jurassic Park, kind of.
[192:46.73]I kind of like it.
[192:52.00]I don't mind this.
[192:52.66]Okay, we're going to leave that for now.
[192:59.08]I'll come back to this.
[193:00.68]Okay, so now I need to figure out where I'm going to have my leisure time.
[193:07.05]And I think this is going to be an aquarium in here, by the way.
[193:14.43]That's going to be the aquarium room.
[193:16.91]In fact, let's get this started right now.
[193:31.96]Okay, I need counters.
[193:38.19]Counter.
[193:41.81]Okay.
[193:54.36]My fucking eye!
[193:55.08]It's fucked up!
[193:58.20]Alright, I need this.
[193:59.38]I need a long counter.
[194:04.61]Are you allergic to reptiles?
[194:06.23]No, I'm fine.
[194:08.79]This is way too short.
[194:09.77]It's like a shoe rack.
[194:13.36]Dude, you blink like a reptile.
[194:14.86]I also go like this.
[194:18.44]Every 15 seconds.
[194:19.70]I probably am a reptile.
[194:27.05]That has to be a little bit higher.
[194:34.13]I blink a lot.
[194:36.09]I lick my lips all the time.
[194:37.79]I don't know.
[194:38.37]This is going to be so sick coming in.
[195:03.00]Oh, this has been facing the wrong way the whole time, hasn't it?
[195:07.60]Has it?
[195:08.08]It has been.
[195:08.77]Oops.
[195:09.47]I gotta go.
[195:10.11]Shit.
[195:10.41]I gotta fix that.
[195:13.65]The other ones in there are backwards.
[195:16.67]It's okay.
[195:18.97]Light.
[195:19.99]They all have lights?
[195:23.59]Well, that's cool.
[195:24.58]Okay.
[195:25.16]Well, these have to flip.
[195:34.71]Just leave them?
[195:35.37]At this point, I really don't care.
[195:36.63]Those are not flush.
[195:52.52]Okay.
[195:53.56]Fish tanks.
[195:58.22]Okay.
[195:58.86]Fresh water.
[195:59.48]We'll do fresh water over here.
[196:04.76]Whoa, that's a lot.
[196:06.05]This is huge.
[196:07.97]Um... I can't... Alright, I gotta rethink this.
[196:26.32]Oh my god, this is too big.
[196:28.28]Um... This is way too fucking big.
[196:33.46]Maybe not.
[196:34.57]It's not gonna be big if I have a smaller door.
[196:48.92]Nice.
[196:49.86]Is this facing the wrong way?
[196:52.18]I can't really tell.
[197:16.96]Ooh.
[197:22.70]This looks like a PetSmart.
[197:25.54]It kind of does.
[197:26.20]It does look like a PetSmart.
[197:30.97]Stack them?
[197:32.15]Can I do that?
[197:36.83]I can't stack them.
[197:39.53]That's fine.
[197:39.97]I don't need more than that.
[197:41.15]That's a nice entryway.
[197:42.85]It's the Rainforest Cafe.
[197:47.40]Where's the iguana?
[197:51.44]Oh, I didn't finish that.
[197:58.88]Something reptilian.
[198:10.33]This is kind of reptilian.
[198:14.89]Ooh, some of these are pretty reptilian.
[198:24.94]This feels like a really big afterthought.
[198:39.74]What?
[198:43.36]This looks fine.
[198:46.10]This, I like the kind of, uh, the... Yeah, these are like kind of leaves and shit.
[198:59.70]I don't know, people do weird shit like that with paintings, don't they?
[199:02.18]Alright, that's fine.
[199:03.60]Add up a little, uh... A table here.
[199:22.43]Cat aviary?
[199:23.61]What's a cat aviary?
[199:29.21]Where's the dog?
[199:30.83]I haven't gotten there yet.
[199:31.47]I just need like a... Yeah, like one of these is fine.
[199:38.74]No, that's in the way.
[199:39.38]I don't care.
[199:40.64]That's fine.
[199:41.10]This is as good as it's gonna get.
[199:42.24]Because I need to get the animals in here.
[199:44.12]Alright.
[199:45.04]This is the front door.
[199:48.71]You got your cat tree thing here.
[199:53.77]That can stay open.
[199:55.37]I need a little kitchen.
[199:59.71]Kitchen's gonna have to be right here.
[200:02.68]Just a little kitchenette.
[200:04.06]Because this goes into the bathroom.
[200:06.28]This is the bedroom.
[200:08.62]We're gonna move this to here.
[200:14.86]Because I need this to be a kitchen.
[200:20.53]So that's what's gonna happen.
[200:23.11]I need this to be... This has to be a little kitchen area.
[200:25.51]Otherwise, how am I gonna cook?
[200:26.37]Okay.
[200:43.89]That's better.
[200:44.47]Okay, so now this can be a little kitchen corner.
[200:47.69]I'm thinking, um... I want tile.
[200:53.17]Let's see how this looks.
[201:10.29]No passion!
[201:13.79]That looks stupid.
[201:18.07]If this is a kitchen area.
[201:31.01]I need to see the whole thing.
[201:37.48]Looks like a pizza parlor.
[201:43.85]Why do I know what you mean, but it's... I don't... Secret room.
[201:48.62]Secret room.
[201:49.32]Why do you keep saying secret room?
[201:53.98]What do you mean secret room?
[202:01.93]There's a room.
[202:06.09]On your map.
[202:11.35]Huh?
[202:11.57]Huh?
[202:14.98]What is this?
[202:26.82]What the fuck is this?
[202:36.57]What is this?
[202:37.07]Um...
[202:45.47]Oh, well, okay, I can take this down.
[202:51.90]So now this can be the little kitchenette.
[202:56.80]In here.
[203:03.14]Okay, that's much better, because then I can do a little kitchen in here.
[203:05.92]Okay, I get it.
[203:06.81]Nice.
[203:08.09]That makes sense.
[203:08.57]Okay.
[203:10.87]Okay.
[203:11.40]So now let's do... What do I... I don't like the way that looked.
[203:20.03]Something nice and kitchen-y.
[203:22.04]This is kind of kitchen-y.
[203:29.49]That's kind of kitchen-y, isn't it?
[203:48.47]It looks like a chocolate bar.
[203:49.97]It looks like a new Hershey's chocolate s'more thing.
[203:54.53]Maybe it works.
[203:55.48]I need to see the whole thing.
[204:06.29]Nah.
[204:07.31]I don't like it.
[204:07.73]I don't like it.
[204:11.93]I don't like it.
[204:16.71]I'm not a huge fan.
[204:18.65]So I'm taking it down.
[204:26.59]What about this one?
[204:33.36]It's grandma wallpaper.
[204:34.64]Let's try this one.
[204:35.94]A little bit lighter though.
[204:38.00]Yeah, like a light biscuit.
[204:39.22]Let's try that.
[204:42.12]Light biscuits should be good.
[204:49.01]That's better.
[205:00.60]That's fine.
[205:06.14]Yeah, that looks cute.
[205:10.36]What's wrong with that?
[205:14.01]Should I have it go all the way out, though?
[205:15.63]Yeah, probably.
[205:15.91]Probably.
[205:24.01]Like that.
[205:24.75]I'll change this.
[205:25.43]Okay.
[205:28.01]That floor has to... Gotta go.
[205:30.25]Please add trim.
[205:33.27]I don't... For what?
[205:34.19]I just want to get rid of these.
[205:38.51]Okay.
[205:41.15]So... I need a better floor for here.
[205:46.79]What should I put in here?
[205:47.65]Tile?
[205:48.45]A nicer tile.
[205:51.07]A nice tile.
[205:53.67]I like tile.
[206:00.29]What's wrong with tile?
[206:03.19]One of these looks good.
[206:04.01]I like that.
[206:07.11]Let's try this.
[206:20.63]What's wrong with that?
[206:26.67]I need a stopping point for this, though, and I don't like it being here.
[206:29.64]Oh, it's the same thing that's in the bathroom.
[206:43.74]Is that fine?
[206:44.28]I think that's okay.
[206:46.67]I think that's fine.
[206:53.39]It's a fucking ballroom?
[207:00.61]It's going too far into the living room.
[207:01.99]Well, I gotta figure out what I want in the living room.
[207:06.82]What the fuck happened?
[207:08.30]Why did this fall?
[207:11.74]Why did that fall?
[207:21.45]That was weird.
[207:24.18]Okay, so I know the kitchen's gonna be here, so we're gonna do kitchen stuff.
[207:29.92]I need a fridge.
[207:32.16]I like this.
[207:39.48]Fridge.
[207:41.94]And then a counter, an oven.
[207:47.61]Oven.
[207:51.41]Okay.
[207:58.05]I'll do a fucking double oven.
[208:02.18]Trip 11.
[208:02.48]Okay, Trip 11.
[208:10.83]And then I'll do some cabinets with a washing machine.
[208:17.23]Dishwasher.
[208:28.77]Just good old stainless steel.
[208:33.91]Put that right here.
[208:38.39]Part of that, we'll get some cabinets here too.
[208:39.86]I need a sink.
[208:44.51]Why, I don't know, why are they so small?
[208:45.67]It's weird.
[209:09.31]Fucking horrible.
[209:14.26]I want just a kitchen sink.
[209:18.76]I just want a kitchen sink.
[209:19.86]Okay, here we go.
[209:20.58]Thank you.
[209:22.54]Give me this one.
[209:26.83]Does this even match?
[209:28.81]Yeah, it's fine.
[209:32.61]Okay.
[209:33.93]We'll do a counter this way.
[209:35.15]One counter, one counter.
[209:35.83]One counter.
[210:20.41]Whoa!
[210:23.88]Give me this thing.
[210:25.34]Oh my god, it's already done.
[210:27.06]I don't have to do anything.
[210:27.80]It's already ready.
[210:42.41]That's so much better.
[210:43.11]Okay, cool.
[210:47.05]That sink is trash.
[210:49.15]It's fine.
[211:00.63]Okay.
[211:09.48]Looks fine.
[211:09.90]Let's make one of these over on the other side.
[211:26.39]I'll be honest, I don't care.
[211:27.29]I don't give a shit.
[211:28.11]I tell you, I don't care.
[211:41.85]Good enough.
[211:43.36]Zero passion.
[211:44.14]I'm passionate about the animals.
[211:46.52]Not about what the kitchen looks like.
[211:52.86]It's not even that bad.
[211:53.62]Alright, so now I can... Let's clean this up.
[211:56.92]Cat, tower, aquarium.
[212:00.02]And then the bugs and the... Bugs will be down here.
[212:03.91]Okay, cool.
[212:05.07]Let's get that started.
[212:05.83]Alright, I need some dog stuff.
[212:07.21]And cat stuff.
[212:12.32]Here's the little kitchen.
[212:13.32]Living room.
[212:19.80]Oops.
[212:22.26]I'll put stairs somewhere else.
[212:25.33]Stairs will be... Where the hell are the stairs going to go?
[212:36.49]I think they need to be down over here.
[212:39.57]Over here in this corner?
[212:40.48]Where am I going to put the stairs?
[212:46.82]I thought maybe they can only be in that spot.
[212:56.99]This works.
[212:59.92]This actually kind of works.
[213:18.28]Come on, really?
[213:19.14]Give me a break.
[213:48.13]Okay.
[213:56.49]This is scary.
[213:57.59]I need it there temporarily.
[214:02.23]I can't even go down this.
[214:08.18]There's so many more.
[214:09.02]Okay.
[214:10.28]But it takes up so much less space.
[214:14.70]This takes up so much less room.
[214:19.69]The other one is this big.
[214:21.11]It's so massive.
[214:27.07]Evil Cellar.
[214:28.24]Not... Just wait.
[214:31.02]It's less cute.
[214:32.70]What do the other stairs look like?
[214:39.48]Garden stairs... Okay, wait.
[214:41.72]Stairs.
[214:44.22]Alright, this is way better.
[214:45.80]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[214:46.76]We'll make it a little darker.
[214:55.17]Okay, that's better.
[214:57.46]Oh my god, it's so... It's too huge.
[215:00.00]Look at how huge this fucking thing is.
[215:02.00]It's the whole house.
[215:03.82]I'm keeping the attic stairs.
[215:07.44]Yeah, look at this.
[215:08.93]This is not gonna work.
[215:14.25]Put it on the side?
[215:32.11]They're too big.
[215:33.37]The spiral takes up less space.
[215:37.54]I want a little one.
[215:46.79]Yeah, less space.
[215:49.69]Really?
[215:49.97]This is the whole house.
[215:53.87]This is the entire house.
[216:17.10]Alright, this is kind of stupid, but whatever.
[216:20.11]Do I really need the cat thing?
[216:21.51]Are you trying to tell me to get rid of the cat thing?
[216:26.07]I can't put it anywhere else.
[216:27.39]Maybe over here?
[216:27.89]There's no other corner where this can go.
[216:33.76]No, this has to stay.
[216:34.50]I can't move that.
[216:38.76]I think that's fine, although the color is awful.
[216:46.99]This just needs to be a little more unassuming.
[216:50.77]Okay, that's a little better.
[216:52.95]I think that's fine.
[216:55.76]It doesn't matter.
[216:58.40]Look, this is not going to be a TV.
[216:59.62]I'm putting the couch right here to watch the cats.
[217:01.90]That's more interesting than television anyways.
[217:12.46]It looks like shit.
[217:15.63]But there's no other place I can put this unless I get rid of this.
[217:25.55]This corner, but then I'd have to make the bathroom entrance here.
[217:31.53]Let's try it.
[217:35.94]Bathroom right in front of the fridge.
[217:45.58]No, this shit is way too fucking big.
[217:47.44]It's so enormous.
[217:48.88]It can't go anywhere.
[217:51.18]Build another room.
[217:52.36]I can't.
[217:54.22]There's no... You cannot build out.
[217:58.98]Yeah, you cannot build out.
[218:00.46]You can only build in.
[218:02.94]I can't build... Where am I supposed to put it?
[218:08.53]The only thing I can think of is... Let's see if this does it.
[218:11.49]Ready?
[218:12.07]Let's try this.
[218:13.61]I have an idea.
[218:21.56]I have an idea.
[218:21.96]Let's see if it works.
[218:35.64]Yep.
[218:38.66]This will be fine.
[219:02.17]Not big enough.
[219:06.11]I could do one here.
[219:11.20]Which, that's fine.
[219:14.36]That's fine.
[219:14.88]That's okay.
[219:15.48]We don't need two snakes.
[219:19.12]I'll find a place for it, but let me see if I can put the staircase here.
[219:23.82]Give me a small staircase.
[219:25.10]Is there a small one I can put right here?
[219:27.94]Right there.
[219:28.50]Come on.
[219:29.10]Really?
[219:29.46]There's no place to go down the stairs?
[219:32.41]I gotta go down there and I gotta break a bunch of shit.
[219:34.21]Hold on.
[219:34.53]It's a fucking dump down here.
[219:58.59]Yeah, I want this here.
[219:59.79]Okay.
[220:18.47]I think that should do it.
[220:19.45]Maybe there's just stuff in the way.
[220:29.65]Is there construction lights or something I can put down here?
[220:36.37]Just a bright-ass construction light.
[220:37.96]I just want to be able to see.
[220:59.78]Okay.
[221:05.84]What the fuck?
[221:06.38]Okay.
[221:17.58]Okay.
[221:19.31]Now I should theoretically be able to move this into this corner.
[221:24.67]At least I hope so.
[221:29.52]Let's find out.
[221:40.62]Why is there a handprint down here?
[221:43.18]I don't know.
[221:43.52]I just bought this place.
[221:50.97]Okay, now can I move?
[221:52.61]Hopefully the lights aren't going to be in the way they might, though.
[221:59.43]Okay, looks good.
[222:01.59]Can I move those over here?
[222:04.94]Right here.
[222:09.24]Come on.
[222:10.86]Even if it has to be the attic, I don't care.
[222:13.44]It just needs to fit there.
[222:14.20]I just need a way to get down the stairs.
[222:20.45]And... Shit.
[222:35.41]Really?
[222:39.64]Is it a wall there or something?
[222:41.40]I don't get it.
[222:43.14]It's a wall here.
[222:44.94]It's a wall, wall, wall, wall, wall.
[222:47.10]Where is that fucking wall?
[222:51.52]Where?
[222:54.74]Oh, bullshit.
[222:55.99]Why is the house wider?
[222:56.97]That should be able to go right there.
[223:05.73]Turn it around?
[223:06.27]I don't think that's going to work.
[223:09.36]I'll try it.
[223:17.20]No.
[223:20.49]No.
[223:20.81]Switch sides.
[223:29.99]Switch sides.
[223:37.85]Oh, shit.
[223:38.63]Is it gonna fit?
[223:41.51]Yes!
[223:42.17]Okay.
[223:42.89]Can the regular staircase fit here, though?
[223:50.45]No, not really.
[223:53.57]Kind of?
[223:57.97]Oh, come on.
[224:21.45]No, but it's messing up my view I guess I could do this
[224:51.92]Something else over here?
[224:52.62]Because now I can move this down.
[224:58.25]I'll get this wall.
[225:05.19]Will that fit over here?
[225:22.98]I think all the snakes can fit now.
[225:26.67]Nice.
[225:26.99]Okay.
[225:28.09]Yes!
[225:28.61]Alright, we're good.
[225:29.05]I want it to be a little bit more unassuming, though.
[225:37.51]I don't like the light.
[225:40.62]That looks good.
[225:46.94]That's fine.
[225:50.66]Okay.
[225:50.76]Okay.
[225:53.29]The light switches above the stairs.
[225:55.11]I'll fix it later.
[225:58.54]Okay, so now... That does that.
[226:02.56]Reptile room is still fine.
[226:03.52]I can fix the green paint.
[226:04.76]Where does this end up?
[226:07.24]Actually, perfect.
[226:08.64]I'm actually really happy with that.
[226:09.66]We're going to keep it.
[226:12.40]Okay, let's get some animals in here.
[226:13.52]Where do I get animals?
[226:16.04]Where do I get animals?
[226:19.60]Where do I get animals?
[226:28.68]Where's my dog?
[226:32.78]Oh, I have to go to the menu.
[226:33.74]Okay.
[226:36.80]Okay, let's get... Where's my dog?
[226:45.23]Where's my dog?
[226:50.53]Okay.
[226:51.65]Come here.
[226:51.99]Alright, there's the dog.
[226:54.99]So now let's get some reptiles.

[227:29.60]There's Crunch!
[227:36.70]Okay, Crunch looks good.

[229:13.64]What a dinosaur.
[229:22.33]I don't think they come out.
[229:27.72]That's so cool.
[229:28.84]Okay, well, have fun in there, Fred.
[229:30.64]Uh, what are you up to?

[237:18.96]I need more room.

[237:47.65]So let me get this.
[237:48.37]Let me do this first.
[237:56.08]How much should I feed?
[237:59.06]The downstairs is for gross animals.
[238:02.70]That's not what I said.
[238:03.74]Where's the turtle?
[238:05.94]Are you alright?
[238:18.07]Oh, hello.
[238:19.35]Hello, Octavius.
[238:21.91]Oh, a little bit of a rascal.

[238:34.88]Now, leave the turtle alone.
[238:35.86]Alright, tug-of-war.
[238:42.12]Doesn't care.
[238:46.64]Alright, everybody get out of here.
[238:49.62]Everybody come out of this room.
[238:52.51]You're my favorite, but don't tell anybody.
[238:53.93]Okay.
[238:56.93]Okay.
[239:02.92]There are just birds?
[239:15.41]Flight.
[239:20.19]Never mind.
[239:20.61]Ooh, look at this one.
[239:31.37]How about one of these bunny houses right here?
[239:37.25]Bugs.
[239:41.07]Alright, bugs.
[239:41.87]You can be over... Where should I put bugs?
[239:49.43]Over here in the corner?
[239:51.37]This is a fun spot.
[239:52.27]This is cute.
[239:58.92]Oh, there you are.
[240:00.57]What can you do with the bunny?
[240:02.67]Oh, that's so cute.
[240:03.35]Here.
[240:03.49]Want a treat?
[240:10.12]Oh, I need a litter box.
[240:10.92]Okay.
[240:11.14]Okay.
[240:31.93]I gotta feed the fish, don't I?
[240:33.11]Are there any fish even in here?
[240:38.91]How do you... I gotta feed the fish.
[240:44.44]Okay, they got a little box now.
[240:45.74]Is there a pig on the ground?
[240:53.22]Oh, there's like a little... Yeah, there's a poop right here.
[240:55.38]Alright, I have a little box now, so I'm fine.
[240:59.43]Do I have to pick it up?
[241:06.30]Okay, I need a new floor.
[241:15.05]The floor is shit-colored.
[241:20.53]The floor... I can't tell.
[241:24.13]Okay, will they actually use the litter boxes?
[241:30.64]Do not go outside.
[241:32.00]No, no, no, no.
[241:35.33]Nobody's going outside.
[241:37.67]Everyone's staying right here.
[241:38.83]And how come no one's used the fun cat thing?
[241:41.87]There's a shit in the sink?
[241:46.33]There is not a shit in the sink.
[241:53.33]Okay.
[241:54.97]Wait, maybe I shouldn't let them go out.
[241:56.87]Yeah, you need to go out, right?
[241:59.15]It's a big yard.
[242:00.83]You guys want to go hang out?
[242:01.71]Look, there's... Just be careful.
[242:13.37]The eagle.
[242:14.29]Is there a fence?
[242:16.17]I don't think their programming will make them... I don't... This is an invisible wall, I think.
[242:21.11]Yeah, it's an... It's not an invisible wall.
[242:28.92]I don't think they can even come down here.
[242:31.26]I really... I really doubt it.
[242:32.48]This is my cat?
[242:39.00]Oh, come here.
[242:40.55]Go get the yarn.
[242:47.96]They're having so much fun.
[242:48.85]Look, everyone's having such a good time.
[242:52.99]Put a fence?
[242:54.51]I don't... Does a fence even exist?
[243:01.17]This is for a bunny enclosure.
[243:16.65]There.
[243:16.87]Now they can't go over here.
[243:32.66]There.
[243:33.02]Okay.
[243:33.30]That's good.
[243:35.22]This looks like shit.
[243:37.54]It just needs to be practical.
[243:38.48]It doesn't have to look alright.
[243:40.44]Very cool.
[243:41.06]Alright.
[243:41.46]This one has a fence around here.

[257:59.53]I just didn't understand.
[258:00.25]Hidden room off the kitchen?

[258:22.43]Okay.
[258:22.73]I can put some toys in here.
[258:27.46]That can stay there.
[258:28.22]I should just sleep on the floor.
[258:31.60]Who cares?
[258:33.86]Where did you get this?
[258:37.63]You don't have any needs.
[258:38.47]Somebody has needs over here.

[258:41.61]Needs sleep.
[258:42.29]Oh, we'll go to bed.

[259:13.31]Okay, let's put a few toys in there.
[259:15.63]Is this rabbit shit or is this cat shit?
[259:17.35]I don't know.
[259:20.94]This floor has to be a different color than shit brown.
[259:24.84]It's changing right now.
[259:25.94]I don't know.
[259:36.99]These?
[259:37.13]These?
[259:50.35]Okay, at least I can see the shit on the ground.
[259:51.81]Okay.
[260:21.66]The door doesn't go anywhere.
[260:22.98]I know.
[260:23.60]I haven't fixed it yet.
[260:24.78]I'm in the process of getting this done.
[260:29.24]My game is lagging.
[260:30.18]There's too many animals in this house.
[260:33.73]Okay.
[260:34.69]We have some comfortable living space now.
[260:37.71]Tons of room over here.
[260:40.45]Did you just... It's okay.
[260:45.08]Go in the dog bed.
[260:47.02]Okay.

[260:48.50]What else do I want?
[260:50.49]You need more animals.
[260:52.25]I mean, I need space to accommodate them.
[260:53.65]Okay, rodents.
[260:59.41]Hamster?
[261:01.61]There's no rats.
[261:04.35]I think the game is having trouble loading any more animals.
[261:13.13]The game does not want to load any more animals.
[261:16.59]It doesn't like that I have 10 already.
[261:22.76]Fill the house with spiders.
[261:24.02]Alright, let me move this out of the way.
[261:29.07]Can I not put any more?
[261:30.05]That's kind of annoying.
[261:34.03]What's wrong with this?
[261:46.53]Excuse me?
[261:50.64]How is that not in a room?
[261:57.67]I don't get it.
[262:01.35]There's plenty of room.
[262:08.33]The ceiling is too low.
[262:11.23]The light?
[262:13.11]Oh, god damn it.
[262:21.38]Okay.
[262:25.18]Can I not put any more animals in?
[262:32.55]Dude, what is the problem?
[262:33.58]There's nothing on the wall.
[262:46.35]Whatever.
[262:46.69]Okay.
[262:50.63]Can I go back to the... I want to get some spiders and rats and stuff.
[263:05.41]There we go.
[263:06.07]Okay.
[263:06.67]So, let's see.
[263:09.25]Spiders.
[263:18.54]Spidey.
[263:26.84]Spidey.
[263:27.20]Somebody said, I love how you're putting the gross animals down here.
[263:33.21]Where... Ah!
[263:34.09]He's right there.
[263:34.53]I see him.
[263:35.94]Oh, what the fuck?
[263:39.16]Oh.
[263:40.22]I don't like that.
[263:49.93]Okay.
[263:53.68]Don't let it out.
[263:55.90]Don't let it out.
[264:00.27]Why is it on the floor?
[264:01.05]Because I need to... I'm just temporarily... I just want to see if it did.
[264:04.61]Alright, I have a snake room.
[264:06.55]Okay, this one's fine.
[264:11.74]I have one already.
[264:22.27]Slimy.
[264:28.82]Morbius?
[264:29.94]Fine.
[264:30.80]It's the only time you're gonna get that.
[264:31.92]Alright, where is he?
[264:34.08]Where's the snake?
[264:40.97]Oh, there you are.
[264:42.59]You eat eggs?
[264:51.92]That's cool.
[264:56.30]There's the turtle.
[264:57.16]I could probably put a few turtles down here if I wanted to.
[264:59.76]Okay.
[265:06.25]There's the iguana.
[265:09.23]Spiders.
[265:09.71]Alright.
[265:12.03]I need the computer down here.
[265:21.84]You can go out there.
[265:22.38]It's fine.
[265:23.80]You can go outside.
[265:24.34]Go for it.
[265:26.97]Stop shitting next to the food.
[265:28.59]Not happy?
[265:34.59]Here, look.
[265:35.09]Go get it.
[265:37.40]Come here.
[265:44.16]How do I... How about play with yarn?
[265:47.80]You wanna play with yarn?
[265:51.50]Get it.
[265:55.41]Oh, there you go.
[265:55.85]You're happy now.
[265:56.31]Okay.
[265:56.41]Okay.
[265:58.73]Okay.
[266:00.05]People are happy.
[266:02.07]Yeah, they have a little box.
[266:04.61]Somebody... What's wrong with you?
[266:05.69]What's going on?
[266:07.48]You're not happy and you need to sleep.
[266:09.76]Well, go lie down.
[266:10.60]Nice catch.
[266:14.44]Go lie down over here.
[266:15.60]There's a nice bed just waiting for you and you just go lie in it.
[266:24.63]Go to sleep.
[266:27.67]So cute.
[266:33.28]I know that's your favorite bone, but you need to go lie down.
[266:35.34]He doesn't want to go to sleep.
[266:43.39]Alright, who else needs something?
[266:47.49]No needs.
[266:50.05]Okay.
[266:53.30]No needs, so then... Oh, they were hungry, okay.
[266:55.82]You still need to go to sleep.
[266:57.40]Go to bed.
[266:59.34]Everyone else is fine, except for...
[267:02.90]You.
[267:04.39]No, you're fine too.
[267:06.57]So what's wrong with you?
[267:07.21]What's going on here?
[267:09.27]No needs.
[267:12.75]Okay, so you need to go to sleep.
[267:13.95]Alright, let's go.
[267:15.55]Um... It's kind of dirty over here, isn't it?
[267:20.19]It's dirty as hell over here.
[267:32.25]I think it's outside the house.
[267:33.07]Okay.
[267:38.53]The beds are backwards.
[267:44.82]I don't know how that's possible.
[267:46.88]By the way.
[267:47.30]I don't know what you mean.
[267:48.10]It's... What?
[267:50.26]What?
[268:12.56]You were right.
[268:13.94]What?
[268:16.00]There is no backwards.
[268:17.78]It's a rectangle.
[268:20.90]Actually backwards.
[268:22.12]That's ridiculous.
[268:23.05]Okay, well, whatever.
[268:24.65]I'm going to move this temporarily out here so there's an extra bed.
[268:31.45]Back down here.
[268:33.31]You look good.
[268:35.17]I need to organize this area.
[268:39.26]Okay, so I want
[268:42.71]Let's put, like... I don't know.
[268:45.87]We should go down there.
[268:49.00]I'm taking the computer downstairs.
[268:53.04]Be good.
[269:00.06]Okay, how much money do I have?
[269:03.79]Birds.
[269:04.25]Should I have birds down here?
[269:06.23]No.
[269:07.49]How many more spiders should I have?
[269:29.26]50?
[269:29.32]I don't think I can have 50.
[269:31.75]There are no more spiders left to buy.
[269:38.09]Okay, what about rodents?
[269:43.27]Hamster?
[269:43.69]Yep.
[269:44.75]Definitely gonna have a hamster.
[269:52.03]Oh my god, that's big.
[269:56.15]We'll put some hamsters in here.
[270:10.10]Aww.
[270:10.40]Alright, you need a light.
[270:14.48]I'm definitely going to not have the snake be in this room.
[270:17.60]No, that's not happening.
[270:36.11]Are you in here?
[270:37.08]Okay, you're in here.
[270:37.64]And you have an egg, right?
[270:38.40]Yep, you're good.
[270:40.85]It's dark down here.
[270:41.49]I gotta put some lights in here.
[270:43.64]There's the turtle.
[270:45.08]There's the hamster.
[270:45.68]It's too dark in here.
[270:46.34]Let's get some light.
[270:47.90]Get a Guinea pig?
[270:49.12]Yeah, I'll get a Guinea pig.
[270:54.16]Just something basic.
[270:55.70]Yeah, this is fine.
[270:57.30]Just basic shit.
[270:59.24]Just like Minecraft fucking torches.
[271:00.76]It doesn't matter.
[271:30.35]There we go.
[271:34.65]Can I play with the hamster?
[271:38.36]I think I can just watch.
[271:43.86]So cute.
[271:44.30]Okay, there are the three spiders.
[271:48.00]There is my snake.
[271:50.40]The iguana.
[271:52.57]Alright, what else can I buy?
[271:53.37]Okay, that's a Guinea pig.
[272:01.21]Uh... This one looks good.
[272:06.86]Um, frumpy.
[272:11.32]Oh my god, this is way too big.
[272:15.11]This is a children's playground.
[272:17.34]This is not an enclosure for a Guinea pig.
[272:31.48]Cool.
[272:34.02]Well, have fun in here.
[272:43.85]Ugh.
[272:45.38]It's a fucking alien.
[273:04.47]They need way more space than people think.
[273:07.06]Do they really?
[273:10.66]This is a huge enclosure.
[273:11.78]I hope they're very happy.
[273:19.43]Okay, what else?
[273:25.54]I don't need any more turtles.
[273:32.00]Another hamster?
[273:33.38]Nah.
[273:35.59]How about a husky?
[273:39.89]Um, husko.
[273:46.35]No rats?
[273:47.15]Yeah, there's no rats.
[273:49.16]How about some birds?
[274:01.39]I think I've... Should I put birds?
[274:06.85]Okay, I'm gonna get some birds in here.
[274:08.43]Guys, I haven't slept in five days.
[274:12.79]I need to fix the bedroom.
[274:22.93]Where can this even go?
[274:23.87]Holy shit.
[274:27.19]Guys, this can't go anywhere.
[274:40.38]Is this... Wait, do they actually want to be outside, though?
[274:59.84]Okay, let's get some birds.
[275:00.66]What are you doing down here?
[275:10.31]Okay, here's a parrot.
[275:21.51]Tweety!
[275:27.44]Thanks to your good care, your pet David is growing up.
[275:29.90]Please remember that all pets, regardless of age, need much attention.
[275:33.80]Who?

[276:27.21]Flappy!
[276:29.69]And...
[276:39.78]Slippy.
[276:44.38]Alright, I need you to come with me.
[276:45.16]What are you looking at?
[276:56.37]Okay, you're good?
[276:57.29]Come with me?
[276:57.77]I thought that was a huge shit log.
[277:00.51]I was about to say, oh my god.

[277:57.53]What do I do?
[278:14.79]Well, how do I fix this?
[278:21.85]Too many pets.
[278:30.69]A room is still walled off.
[278:32.97]Okay, they're fine.
[278:43.31]Do they actually... Would they want to come out?
[278:48.51]No, right?

[281:10.50]You still have food, right?
[281:15.81]Was the whole ground just food?
[281:18.71]No.
[281:21.57]Hay is food.
[281:25.66]Get another Guinea pig.
[281:26.50]No, I'm not, there's no, I'm not getting any more animals.

[281:48.20]How you doing over here?
[281:50.52]I can't put food in here.

[281:59.40]Okay.
[282:01.16]How you doing?

[282:08.97]Okay, so now... Where's my laptop?
[282:13.49]The Guinea pig needs a friend.
[282:16.33]No, I'm not getting any more... No more animals!
[282:18.06]No, no more.
[282:18.78]This is it.
[282:20.16]This is what I can reliably take care of.
[282:21.94]Okay.
[282:26.98]So now...
[282:30.62]So now what?
[282:31.18]Some of them can go.
[282:38.42]Because I took them from his hotel, right?
[282:41.88]And I was like housing them for a little while.
[282:43.53]The doorways are too small.
[282:45.59]Adopt a child.
[282:46.87]Okay.
[282:57.86]Where are my animals?
[283:00.36]Oh, here we go.
[283:00.86]Okay.
[283:02.88]So then somebody comes in and adopts them?

[283:12.33]Alright, so David, you want to find a new home for David?

[283:30.86]Okay.
[283:36.88]Scrumptious isn't going to stick around.
[283:39.58]I've been taking care of them and I want them to have good homes.
[283:44.14]Perfect.
[283:44.68]I think perfect could get a good home.
[283:49.28]Bugs?
[283:51.10]Oh, I was like, why do they have bugs?
[283:55.94]Okay.
[283:56.60]Bugs should probably have a new home.

[284:25.46]Don't sell them.
[284:26.18]I'm not selling them.
[284:26.86]What are you talking about?
[284:29.52]You're deleting them.
[284:35.13]I'm not deleting them for finding new homes!
[284:37.24]What are you talking about?
[284:48.73]Yeah, I want to make sure they have good homes!
[284:50.83]I don't want to have too many that I can't take care of.

[290:11.45]And it says, okay, so here's who is at my house.
[290:14.99]Find a new home.

[290:32.82]You guys are fucked.
[290:38.74]Show us the homes?
[290:40.08]I don't... There's not that much in this.
[290:43.72]What?
[290:48.76]Oh, shit.
[290:49.02]I just went to sleep.
[291:04.86]Ah, bugs.
[291:09.16]Do you actually see the people?
[291:11.06]This one's really cool looking.
[291:14.06]It's blue and orange.
[291:15.30]That's crazy.
[291:17.30]You're good.
[291:17.74]You're happy.
[291:21.15]Fill up your hay again.
[291:28.29]Give you some more food.
[291:29.89]You still have leaves there.
[291:30.93]What's this guy's name?
[291:35.45]Fred?
[291:38.96]Hi, Fred.
[291:39.96]What's Turtle's name?
[291:44.58]Hello!
[291:48.25]I like Doofus more than I like Lassie.
[291:50.45]Oh, that was Crunch, right.
[291:53.85]I wish I could take you out and kind of let you run around a little.
[291:58.15]In a safe, enclosed space.
[292:01.40]You doing good?
[292:03.36]How are you doing in here?
[292:07.28]Oh, right!
[292:07.80]Fred got adopted!
[292:10.32]That's right.
[292:11.04]Fred got adopted.
[292:11.68]Hope you're having a good time, Fred, in your new home.
[292:20.34]Uh, I just fed you.
[292:21.22]Okay.
[292:27.93]How you doing?
[292:28.39]Tired?
[292:28.77]You want to play?
[292:29.71]Here.
[292:29.87]I love how the dogs want to play with the cat toys, too.
[292:40.24]You tired, Doofus?
[292:45.48]No needs.
[292:46.15]Alright, I think it's time to send out some more.
[292:50.95]I think you're just tired.
[292:52.15]Yeah, you... Doofus just won't go to bed.
[292:59.07]How come Doofus won't sleep?
[293:00.91]He just won't go to bed.
[293:05.59]Fish, uh... You don't feed the fish.
[293:07.55]They just kind of hang out.
[293:09.89]There's no mechanic to feed them.
[293:13.47]Yeah, these guys are all full up with food.
[293:16.64]They're all good.
[293:17.84]How are you?
[293:18.34]Maybe we should get some adoptions going here.
[293:25.37]Uh, you were adopted, so I can get rid of that.
[293:39.94]I want to adopt Crunch.
[293:43.68]I want Crunch to be adopted from me.
[293:46.08]And I want Scrumptious.
[293:48.88]And Doofus.
[293:54.10]The rest are going to have good homes.
[293:56.72]Crunch, I'm keeping Crunch.
[294:03.25]Actually, I'll keep Lassie too.
[294:06.79]I'll keep Doofus.
[294:12.19]It's kind of glitched out.
[294:20.14]Okay, so I want Crunch.
[294:23.54]I could keep Scrumptious.
[294:25.30]Oh, Chievous would be so wonderful.
[294:26.88]Let's get Chievous a new home.
[294:30.61]Eiffel?
[294:31.87]Eiffel would do so good in a new home.
[294:34.03]Come on in.
[294:35.27]Adopt.
[294:38.07]Well, Sweetie, we'll keep Sweetie.
[294:42.29]Oh, the fish.
[294:42.97]That's cool.
[294:44.65]Okay.
[294:47.14]We'll keep Doofus.
[294:50.12]We'll keep Spidey.
[294:52.08]We'll adopt out... We'll keep Morbius.
[294:55.84]Alright.
[294:56.34]We have some... Anybody want to come in and get the spiders?
[295:02.69]Oh, that's a hamster.
[295:03.53]I feel like somebody would have a lot of fun with this hamster.
[295:09.75]Frumpy would have a lot of fun with a new owner, too.
[295:12.87]Keep spider four.
[295:16.80]This is all temporary.
[295:18.00]I wanted to make sure that I could house them.
[295:19.86]Alright, Flappy.
[295:23.02]I'll keep one of the parrots.

[297:19.44]Where are all the huge dogs?
[297:21.48]What is the title of this fucking stream?
[297:28.48]I mean, technically this was a huge dog house.

[297:49.49]Everyone is happy.
[297:53.09]Don't need these, because I just need one.
[297:59.01]I don't think Doofus has slept since he got here.
[298:05.05]Okay.
[298:07.84]Do you want a bigger bed?
[298:08.96]I wonder if it's, is it the size?
[298:14.00]Does he, do you want a bigger bed?
[298:16.16]You're kind of a big dog.
[298:17.40]Are there big beds?
[298:20.20]Open the bedroom.
[298:34.81]Okay, here we go.
[298:35.37]I don't even need a bedroom.
[298:41.23]This can just be another- Okay, will you sleep in here if I put a... like a big bed in here?
[298:48.31]I wanted to get some sleep.

[299:07.16]Dog... Dark dog couch woof.
[299:10.22]Okay, this is extra large.
[299:13.58]How is that extra large?
[299:16.95]This doesn't look like an extra large bed.
[299:20.69]That looks like a small bed.
[299:21.67]Why are these all so small?
[299:43.37]Okay.
[299:44.33]Okay, hi.
[299:47.35]Yeah, he's not on follow.

[301:17.53]It's going to be a quiet little space right over here.
[301:20.57]I know it's very exciting, but you should go live right in here.
[301:24.89]It's very exciting.
[301:28.28]There you go.
[301:29.10]Go on, lie down.
[301:30.04]Oh, God.
[301:32.92]No, get out of here.
[301:34.96]He's trying to sleep.
[301:41.94]He's not on follow, look.
[301:45.34]He just turned the lights off.
[301:50.97]He's just too excited.
[301:52.09]Okay.

[302:36.86]What?
[302:38.74]No.
[302:43.24]I didn't know that.
[302:44.40]I thought it was... But their default set to follow me.
[302:51.76]Okay, so in my brain, this is not follow me, right?
[302:58.83]He's under stay.

[304:40.50]I think he's just sitting there.
[304:55.15]I've been coming down here and putting food in and stuff.
[304:59.63]No, I don't think they can die like that.
[305:03.83]No, I don't think so.
[305:09.54]No, look, look!
[305:10.64]Ready, watch this!

[305:39.11]That's just an image.
[305:40.91]Why would I be able to move him around if he was... I think he's just bugged.
[305:45.15]I really do.
[305:46.81]I honestly think he's bugged.
[305:49.80]Watch.
[305:50.04]Ready?

[306:07.48]Okay?
[306:08.28]Pick from the hotel.
[306:09.72]Go back into your aquarium.
[306:16.57]All these motherfuckers telling me that Crunch was dead.
[306:19.07]All these motherfuckers telling me Crunch was dead.
[306:21.53]Nope.
[306:24.81]Everybody telling me Crunch was dead.
[306:29.12]I've been coming down here and I've been having... It's fine.
[306:31.62]It's fine.
[306:34.06]Crunch just was... AI just walked into a wall for a second.
[306:38.94]Dude, you posted Crunch.
[306:42.13]I've been feeding them.
[306:42.75]I've been having... I was right.
[306:49.37]I've been hanging out with them.
[306:53.72]How you doing?
[306:54.20]Good?
[306:54.38]I think you're sleeping down here.
[307:03.00]I think you're asleep down here.
[307:06.39]Oh, no, they were adopted.
[307:11.65]Yeah, everyone's trying to tell me to fucking crunch.
[307:13.67]Crunch is perfectly fine.
[307:22.28]In fact, let's get... Because I know I'm keeping you... You know, I'm going to bring you into the bedroom.
[307:27.08]I think that's... I mean, never mind.
[307:28.74]No, I'm not...
[307:37.16]Okay.
[307:41.22]How you doing?
[307:42.40]Doing good?
[307:42.78]Everyone's doing good.
[307:45.97]I did... This hamster got adopted.
[307:52.29]So I can put you back over here.
[307:55.05]In this spot right here.
[307:57.47]Very cool.
[307:58.31]Alright.
[308:02.98]Look at how happy you are.
[308:03.84]Very cool.
[308:05.04]Wanna play?
[308:05.30]Okay.
[308:10.63]Doofus.
[308:18.73]Why do you hate doofus?
[308:23.37]How are you?
[308:23.85]It looks like you both have grown up.
[308:25.94]Need some sleep.
[308:27.22]Make sure you're not on like follow.
[308:28.44]Wait.
[308:29.52]So when it says follow me, that means that they're staying, right?
[308:36.64]That's correct.
[308:43.45]So I have to click that.
[308:44.37]Okay.
[308:52.01]Happy, happy.
[308:53.27]Here, you wanna play?
[308:54.91]Come, let's, come, come outside.
[308:58.01]Let's get some exercise.
[308:58.83]Go get it!
[309:02.88]No, not Doofus!
[309:04.80]Dude, of course Doofus is gonna go get it.
[309:12.40]Alright, Doofus, let's get you some exercise.
[309:15.24]Doofus!
[309:18.96]There we go.
[309:19.60]Alright, come on up.
[309:23.10]Good, catch.
[309:27.91]They're not really dirty.
[309:29.09]Yeah, they look really clean.
[309:32.57]I'll get a cleaning station right here.
[309:33.89]And then I'm probably going to end the stream soon.
[309:37.51]I feel like I've done everything I wanted to do.
[309:50.63]You want to... Oh, well, okay.
[309:51.91]Well, now you're dirty.
[309:54.09]You did not look like this before.
[309:55.19]Here you go.
[310:03.90]You ready?
[310:06.21]Let's get clean.
[310:20.75]Very good.
[310:22.05]Do you need to clean?
[310:23.89]I don't think you do anything with the cats.
[310:26.99]You want to play?
[310:27.83]Alright, here we go.
[310:28.31]Ready?
[310:28.47]This is for you.
[310:30.95]Get it!
[310:41.54]I know I joked about the house, but I hope you had fun making it and the animals are very cute.
[310:44.78]Yeah, it was fun.
[310:48.81]That's definitely a cool addition to the game.
[310:53.68]Go get it.
[311:03.57]Nice patch of grass.
[311:07.89]It's fine.
[311:08.75]Don't worry.
[311:10.23]Everybody seems happy.
[311:10.91]I think... Is Doofus clean?
[311:17.06]Do you need to be clean?
[311:17.82]No, you're fine.
[311:29.98]Fish is doing good.
[311:34.56]Very good.
[311:35.85]You don't feed the fish though.
[311:51.54]Everyone's having such a good time.
[311:53.16]The fish are starving.
[311:54.22]I can't feed them.
[311:57.20]They're just... I think there's like an auto-feeder or something.
[312:02.71]They never used the cat wall, yeah.
[312:05.91]They didn't.
[312:07.35]How do you- I wonder how you get them to use it.
[312:17.81]Can you put them on it?
[312:19.07]Um, let me see if anyone will think it's fun.
[312:22.66]Well, you're too tired.
[312:23.32]I don't want to do that.
[312:24.88]Where's, uh, where's Scrumptious?
[312:28.46]Scrumptious?
[312:31.96]Where's Scrumptious?
[312:34.63]How you doing out here?
[312:35.23]Need food?
[312:38.45]No, you got plenty of food.
[312:42.09]Um... You might be stuck somehow.
[312:46.68]I think the game maybe has you stuck.
[312:54.98]Okay.
[312:55.38]I don't know.
[312:55.96]How did that happen?
[313:00.78]He's going insane.
[313:03.95]I'm...
[313:07.37]Hold on.
[313:07.75]Alright, Tweety.
[313:26.44]We'll get Tweety adopted.
[313:28.11]I can't fix Tweety.
[313:29.31]Tweety was stuck in the seat or whatever it is.
[313:34.03]What?
[313:36.93]What?
[313:39.08]I'm finding new homes.
[313:40.46]You guys are fucked.
[313:43.75]Alright.
[313:44.57]I think that's probably it.
[313:45.43]That was fun.
[313:50.01]I didn't want to go too overboard.
[313:53.53]Because there's no way.
[313:54.94]That was the limit of the amount of animals I was able to reliably even take care of in the game.
[313:59.76]So I didn't want to keep adding animals.
[314:03.34]How could you?
[314:09.28]Get them all adopted?
[314:12.64]Well, I can... I can take care of all these.
[314:16.17]Two dogs, two cats, a couple of lizards.
[314:20.69]I'm okay with this.
[314:22.91]I'm not... No, I'm keeping... No, these are my best friends.
[314:30.30]All the other ones were my good friends too, but we got them new homes.
[314:34.44]If you turn the game off, they die.
[314:35.82]Okay.
[314:37.49]That's not true.
[314:38.33]They continue to live here and have fun.
[314:44.96]This is a substantial update.
[314:46.16]I did not think there was going to be this much stuff in it.
[314:48.78]There's a lot.
[314:50.60]This is really cute.
[314:51.36]It is.
[314:51.62]That was really funny.
[314:52.56]That was really cute.
[314:58.09]Start a dog sanctuary.
[315:00.63]Well, that's why I wanted to make sure I had enough beds.
[315:02.38]Had enough food bowls.
[315:05.28]Once we got to like three, four dogs in the house, it was like, no more.
[315:09.74]No more.
[315:11.70]I cannot take care of any more.
[315:14.98]The cat wall.
[315:15.58]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[315:16.90]Who's, um... Can I see you for a second?
[315:26.17]Your fridge is so ugly.
[315:32.39]Alright.
[315:40.58]We want to hang out on this?
[315:43.82]I don't think so.
[315:48.16]No?
[315:49.10]I just don't think they want to use it.
[315:50.37]I just don't think they like it.
[315:51.59]No?
[315:57.77]No?
[316:02.71]They're on follow?
[316:05.34]Are they?
[316:06.56]Well, these two were playing, so... We were just playing.
[316:14.84]Can I go to bed?
[316:16.02]Okay.
[316:19.10]It does look cool.
[316:19.68]Alright, goodbye, Doofus.
[316:24.61]It's been fun.
[316:26.85]Goodbye, Scrumptious.
[316:28.31]Goodbye, Doofus.
[316:29.09]Goodbye, David.

[317:12.92]that was a back stretch oh yeah multiverse okay so on Friday we're gonna play multiverses for like 40 minutes and then we'll move on to something else was that a good stretch that was a really good stretch actually I feel great
[317:37.01]They're not going to leave the hard drive.
[317:38.43]It's fine.
[317:40.45]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[317:41.09]We're going to start with MultiVersus.
[317:42.37]I'm going to stream earlier than 4.
[317:44.97]Because if it actually turns off at 5 o'clock Pacific, I want to play for at least a couple hours.
[317:50.03]We'll start at like 3.
[317:50.79]3-ish.
[317:54.02]Because I want at least an hour or two.
[317:56.54]Your arms look really small.
[317:59.00]Get a load of that.
[318:00.20]Do they?
[318:01.72]Yeah?
[318:02.52]What did you say?
[318:04.02]Would you excuse say that again?
[318:05.44]If you could?
[318:12.93]Alright.
[318:14.31]Goodbye.
[318:14.67]I'll see you guys Friday.
[318:17.47]That was House Flipper Pets DLC.
[318:19.33]I didn't even pee for five and a half hours.
[318:22.31]That's kind of weird.
[318:27.26]It's fun taking care of pets.
[318:34.54]Who was your favorite?
[318:43.83]My favorite was probably Doofus and Crunch.
[318:47.99]Mainly Crunch because everybody said he was dead, but he wasn't.
[318:51.47]He was alive.
[318:52.41]And I proved it.
[318:54.67]So they're my favorites.
[319:07.46]Scrumptious?
[319:08.08]Yeah.
[319:09.62]David?
[319:10.08]Yeah.
[319:17.20]Everyone was so convinced that Crunch was dead.
[319:21.83]Unanimous in the chat.
[319:23.41]Unanimous.
[319:28.02]Nope.
[319:40.03]Now, see you Friday.
[319:40.79]We'll start with MultiVersus and then from there, because I'm not going to be able to play that game for more than an hour or two.
[319:48.62]From there, we'll probably do... I don't know.
[319:54.54]I'll take a look at the recommended.
[319:55.48]There's a ton of stuff in there.
[319:59.34]We'll probably do a pre-stream poll if you're around.
[320:08.25]But yeah, take care of yourselves.
[320:09.07]Thanks for watching.
[320:12.02]See you again, hopefully.
[320:15.40]This stream started kind of absurd.
[320:18.68]But I think we chilled out a little bit halfway through.
[320:22.70]Which, it's fun.
[320:23.34]It's fun just to hang out.
[320:35.87]You should play ULTRAKILL.
[320:37.57]Yeah, I mean, if it's not in the recommended already, toss it in there.
[320:40.63]I'll go take a look.
[320:43.48]What about more infomercials?
[320:44.56]Yeah, we'll do that too.
[320:51.02]You're in the hospital today.
[320:52.40]Thanks for cheering me up.
[320:53.70]Holy shit, I hope you're alright.
[320:55.00]Hopefully it's nothing serious or anything.
[321:03.61]When's the green screen?
[321:04.99]Green screen in front of the green screen night.
[321:08.23]I'll let you know early this coming week.
[321:12.07]I'm not going to get in front of the green screen for at least a couple weeks.
[321:16.57]Because I want some time for people to do actions.
[321:20.21]And I want some time for me to figure out when I want to get in front of it.
[321:24.70]So it'll be at least a week or two from right now, at least.
[321:32.26]Where can we submit actions?
[321:35.32]So, in the Discord right now, we have a channel.
[321:43.78]It is imminently about to be used.
[321:50.78]We're going to set up a discussion channel to talk about actions.
[321:54.62]What you want me to do in front of the screen.
[322:03.07]I think it's going to open probably soon.
[322:04.89]It is a public Discord with some sub only channels.
[322:10.19]It is the submissions green screen channel.
[322:12.75]Go please read the rules.
[322:13.99]There are a lot of them.
[322:16.69]There are a lot of rules.
[322:24.42]I will give some more info on this.
[322:25.62]Well, actually, we'll talk in detail about the kind of what I'm expecting on Friday.
[322:39.57]Yeah, and also check on the already done actions before you submit.
[322:43.64]We've done this two times now.
[322:44.76]This is the third time.
[322:46.36]I'm not going to do, for instance, I mean, maybe I will for my own sake, for my own amusement.
[322:54.18]But if something, if I've already done it in front of the screen, I'm not going to do it again in a week or two.
[323:00.56]If we already have that footage, then if it's already been submitted, then think of something else.
[323:09.07]Is it sub only submissions?
[323:11.41]No.
[323:15.65]It is not.
[323:26.09]Yeah, take care of yourselves.
[323:26.91]Thanks for watching.
[323:28.59]Take care of your pets.
[323:31.57]Give your dog and cat some love.
[323:35.41]Or if you have any other pets too.
[323:38.53]And I'll see you guys on Friday.
[323:41.68]And always, of course, call your mother.
[323:43.08]Of course.
[323:46.44]Alright, goodnight guys.
[323:47.35]See you soon.
