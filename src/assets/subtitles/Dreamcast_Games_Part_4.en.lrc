[00:01.60]Hello!
[00:04.97]Disk.
[00:05.27]Look at all these discs.
[00:08.57]One disk, two discs, three discs.
[00:13.13]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:14.71]How are you?
[00:20.46]Let me move this.
[00:26.38]What's with all the love and chat?
[00:30.15]What do you mean?
[00:30.71]You should be saying, I'm so glad to see love in chat every day.
[00:34.91]That's what you should be saying.
[00:40.77]That shouldn't be a rarity in my personal pizza.
[00:46.79]But how you doing?
[00:48.03]We're going to pick up right where we were last night with Space Channel 5, part five.
[00:57.81]No, part two.
[00:59.87]Part 2.
[01:10.53]Why do I have to stream so late?
[01:11.99]Why are you late?
[01:12.91]So, here's... New year, new thing!
[01:18.27]I'm gonna stop putting times in the sus command.
[01:25.13]Because I feel like people are starting to get a little frustrated.
[01:28.03]I thought me saying I have no schedule and I have no days planned.
[01:37.56]I thought that I was going to be able to kind of blanket statement say that I don't have a schedule anymore.
[01:43.15]But the sus is there to give like guidelines.
[01:46.55]And I think some people are getting annoyed because...
[01:48.87]the sus will count down to zero as if, like, that's a TV channel and that's when the show starts.
[01:55.00]And that's not what I've been doing.
[01:56.80]So what I'm probably gonna end up doing is just the sus command will end up just being a guideline for the day and the time period.
[02:09.65]So, like, for instance, if a stream is starting tomorrow, uh, tomorrow afternoon, right?
[02:16.13]Pacific.
[02:17.81]Because I feel like I don't want to start to cause a problem where people are sitting here waiting for a stream to start and it's like, oh wait, didn't he say he was going to stream today?
[02:28.37]Yeah, he did.
[02:28.89]Oh, the sus says like 4.25pm, so yeah, that's when it's going to start.
[02:34.94]I don't blame you for thinking that.
[02:38.08]But I think it's for the best to just have the sus command give the day
[02:46.87]at a general time period.
[02:49.51]Every stream is always going to be between 3 and... between like 2.30 and 4 p.m.
[02:56.10]Pacific.
[02:56.76]Every single time.
[02:58.48]Unless there's some kind of extreme other reason why there's no stream there.
[03:03.96]But you can't really put in a sus command.
[03:06.22]There's a stream starting between 2.30 and 4.30 p.m.
[03:10.08]Pacific.
[03:10.74]You can't...
[03:15.11]That would be, that's like, that's like a... I would be like the fucking repairman.
[03:19.78]I would be like the guy, I'd be like the fucking dishwasher deliveryman.
[03:23.34]Giving you a window.
[03:26.96]Oh yeah, so she's been, this is Jerma Industries?
[03:29.06]What time does stream start?
[03:30.60]Uh, well, uh, you know, the technician will be there between 12 and 5.
[03:34.24]Like, oh, okay.
[03:41.36]So, we're just gonna start giving, um...
[03:46.39]Essentially periods so like tomorrow afternoon Pacific But just know that all these streams will always start somewhere around 2 to 4 p.m.
[03:58.72]Pacific I don't want to start it.
[04:00.92]I don't want to get the hard exact times anymore.
[04:02.70]Just I Feel like it's causing a problem and not really a problem, but I feel like it's causing a
[04:09.03]Um, a lot of distress for, not for some of you guys, but me too.
[04:12.77]Because I'll look over at the sauce and it's like, oh, fucking hell.
[04:16.09]It's, what is it, like, I gotta start in four minutes?
[04:18.83]I gotta hurry the fuck up, like.
[04:21.55]Okay, is that thing ready?
[04:23.19]Is OBS over here?
[04:24.51]Shit, wait, why did I just eat?
[04:25.65]I shouldn't have eaten.
[04:26.29]I should have just waited.
[04:27.01]I should have ate, like, four hours from now.
[04:29.31]It's, it's counterproductive.
[04:31.33]That's what I'm saying.
[04:34.05]So, I think it's a good change.
[04:39.93]Jerma, it's a joke.
[04:42.17]No, no, no, no.
[04:43.11]I... I know it is, but it isn't, though.
[04:47.10]Because your time is valuable, too.
[04:49.70]Right?
[04:50.82]It's not all about me.
[04:52.92]So if some of you guys have been here for, you know, 30, 40 minutes...
[04:57.82]Your time is valuable, and I don't want you to ever have a thought in your head that, like, oh, he's a fucking asshole.
[05:04.02]Said he was gonna be here at, like, 3.15.
[05:06.10]You fucking idiot.
[05:08.58]Because, I mean, that's... I don't want to leave you hanging, so... So I think given a general idea, so then people can be like, oh, yeah, that's, like, that's starting, like, probably, like, within the next hour or so.
[05:23.16]I can be, like, I don't have to, like, sit here and, like, he's supposed to be here, you know?
[05:29.13]Your time is valuable.
[05:31.07]But anyways... Don't know if you've read this, but thank you so much for your streams.
[05:42.10]They really help through these tough times.
[05:45.14]Thank you so much, Mupain.
[05:50.30]It's just a joke.
[05:52.68]No, but even if it is just a joke... I know that it's just... I know it's comedy.
[05:59.37]But where the fuck is my phone?
[06:01.81]I changed the sus to like 5.
[06:03.29]I don't know where the phone is.
[06:05.45]I can't even make a tweet about this stream.
[06:07.49]Did I tweet this stream already?
[06:15.92]I don't think so.
[06:16.76]Whatever.
[06:17.32]I have no idea.
[06:23.75]Anywho, Space Channel 5 is where we left off.
[06:36.37]Is that what this was?
[06:37.05]It was just a coffee paste thing?
[06:38.01]That can't be what this was.
[06:39.47]Whatever.
[06:39.67]Alright.
[06:39.89]So, let's go.
[07:06.69]Twitch notifications are broken.
[07:09.43]Oh, god damn it.
[07:11.07]Let's just wait.
[07:12.25]Wait, I gotta get my phone.
[07:13.62]Twitch notifications are actually broken.
[07:15.42]Do I have to actually tweet that?
[07:18.48]Do I need to get my phone?
[07:22.12]Oh, god damn it.
[07:23.84]One guy said, yep.
[07:24.94]So... Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[07:28.70]Oh, god.
[07:30.05]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[07:31.65]Not even too... I'm just gonna sprint down the stairs as fast as I can.
[08:45.48]Okay.
[08:45.68]I found it.
[08:48.75]That was the fastest I think I may have ever ran.
[08:52.21]Not even winded at all.
[08:53.27]Like, my breath is perfectly controlled.
[08:57.39]Okay.
[08:59.28]So.
[09:01.02]Space Channel.
[09:03.16]Presented by SEGA.
[09:07.98]How's that audio look?
[09:11.42]Looks pretty good.
[09:15.83]Wait, we, what?
[09:21.80]You guys, you can't make the hay thing.
[09:25.70]Copy pasta thing.
[09:28.24]You can't, no.
[09:31.33]That's a compounded reference.
[09:32.67]Alright, let's fucking go.
[09:45.00]Open it up.
[09:51.61]A haybeater.
[09:54.81]A haybeater.
[10:09.73]Did we even watch this cutscene?
[10:12.17]I don't think we did.
[10:18.49]Alright, let's beat it.
[10:19.41]Is that Michael Jackson?
[10:24.58]No, that's the bad guy.
[10:25.40]That's the bad... That was Michael Jackson right there.
[10:46.26]The best part about this is when Michael Jackson keeps calling her Yulela.
[10:51.08]Let's go, Yulela.
[10:52.68]Yulala.
[11:00.19]Quiet game?
[11:00.71]No, you just think it's quiet.
[11:02.83]It's actually not that quiet.
[11:04.01]You just think it is.
[11:08.71]How's that?
[11:17.29]Okay, I gotta remember where we were.
[11:19.33]I'm gonna have to do like a practice run.
[11:21.95]Because I was locked in last night.
[11:29.07]I think I'm gonna do level one again just to get back into flow.
[11:31.81]Because we're going right to like report five.
[11:41.92]Try to do a perfect... I don't think I'm ever gonna... I can't do that shit.
[11:54.78]We already saw this.
[11:55.42]You already saw this too?
[12:01.34]What the hell is this?
[12:02.63]Oh, people have no idea they weren't here last night.
[12:05.23]This is Space Channel 5.
[12:07.99]It is a Simon Says game.
[12:12.07]Where you have to save the goddammit.
[12:24.45]Those of you that also were not here last night, this game has a problem where the models just don't show up.
[12:35.58]That's a good indicator of what's going to happen once we start it.
[12:41.67]It's very random.
[12:42.43]Now I'm going to load it up.
[12:43.37]It's going to be in Japanese.
[12:44.21]Watch.
[12:45.47]I bet you a dollar.
[13:00.79]he bet all of us a dollar no no no no I bet uh Kim a dollar okay let's see give us models yes so like I was explaining before I had an epic rage quit
[13:30.80]It is a Simon Says game where you have to match and do exactly what they tell you.
[13:36.32]There are no on-screen prompts.
[13:38.97]You just have to remember what everybody says.
[13:41.55]That's Oolala.
[13:42.31]So I have to do what they do.
[13:59.96]Can I get, like, 100%?
[14:00.63]Let's see if I can get 100%.
[14:02.19]When is the Dreamcast arc going to be over?
[14:04.69]Today.
[14:05.09]This is pretty much it.
[14:07.19]Okay.
[14:31.13]Seaman is not gonna be part of Dreamcast.
[14:33.79]It's gonna have to show up.
[14:35.64]I wasn't paying any attention.
[14:38.04]At all.
[14:38.74]I think it was left, right?
[14:40.42]I wasn't even watching the game.
[14:48.08]I was answering a question.
[14:51.49]It don't matter.
[14:51.91]I'm just doing this to practice.
[15:01.22]Up, down, chew, chew.
[15:07.12]Up, down, chew, chew.
[15:10.68]Right, left, right, left, chew, chew.
[15:14.76]Right, left, right, left, chew, chew.
[15:17.48]See, the one part about this game that is I'm sure you've heard very evident.
[15:21.59]Up, down, up, down, chew, chew, chew.
[15:23.65]Up, down, up, down, chew, chew, chew.
[15:27.31]I can't talk.
[15:27.99]I can't interact.
[15:33.39]This is just a silent gameplay.
[15:35.53]Even, okay, even moving any of my facial tissue screws me up.
[15:53.28]If I like close one eye or like wiggle my nose, I won't be able to do the level.
[15:58.57]I have to wide open eyes, quiet, staring, and press buttons.
[16:04.56]Can you hear the gun?
[16:28.70]So you're not gonna get any like Dunkin Donuts drive-thru stories right now.
[16:33.04]Maybe later.
[16:33.66]I think I'm ready.
[16:57.66]You have to shoot and rescue.
[17:03.18]Tell a story over riot.
[17:05.78]I can't!
[17:08.32]You know how hard that's gonna be for me to do that?
[17:16.71]It's gonna be a handful of adjectives.
[17:19.53]I'm not gonna tell anything.
[17:20.45]I'm gonna go around in an adjective circle.
[17:29.43]Okay, so three days ago, I went to this... Already over.
[17:39.00]Already done.
[17:39.68]Not gonna happen.
[17:46.12]Quit reading chat.
[18:01.38]I'm just gonna pause whenever I have anything to say.
[18:10.44]The levels get progressively more difficult.
[18:14.05]And more elaborate.
[18:16.71]So, okay.
[18:20.29]Let's start, let's do it again.
[18:29.54]This is statistically, by the way, one of the most rage quit games in video game history, if you were questing.
[18:36.00]Look it up.
[18:39.12]Especially level 5.
[18:39.75]There's a portion where you gotta go up, down, up, down, left, right, up, down, right, left, up, down, down, down, down.
[18:45.51]That's where everybody rage quits the game.
[18:47.31]I stayed.
[18:48.77]And I was able to get past it.
[18:56.95]Oh, I just found out, by the way.
[18:58.11]They're making a VR version.
[19:22.84]Of this game.
[19:24.60]Not this one, it's gonna be a new one entirely, I believe.
[19:27.63]That's exciting.
[19:53.37]Oh!
[19:53.83]That was good.
[19:54.33]Nice.
[19:54.73]Oh, they festered me again.
[20:20.93]Is this on original hardware?
[20:22.03]No, it is not.
[20:22.55]This is on Steam.
[20:24.79]You can play this right now on Steam.
[20:27.39]The Dreamcast Collection is... uh... I mean, like, SEGA Bass Fishing is cool for five minutes.
[20:35.15]It's not much there other than, like, a potential 10-20 minute session, unless you really want to try to 100% the game.
[20:49.16]Just buy the good ones?
[20:49.98]If you buy them all alone, the good ones, is it worth just buying the pack?
[20:57.46]Isn't the pack, uh, cheaper?
[20:59.66]It's like eight bucks to buy itself.
[21:05.90]Where's Space Michael?
[21:06.75]Uh, don't worry, Space Michael is available.
[21:10.93]I'm just warming up, because I'm not just gonna jump right into the hardest levels in the game.
[21:15.09]They'll be horrible.
[21:16.31]We'll change your ratings into stars.
[21:23.82]That's good not to get less than alright.
[21:26.78]I'm gonna get higher than 67% Got it down I Gotta like fucking get up and shake my body to like get pumped up so I can do this still on slow.
[21:49.29]Oh
[22:16.56]Down down Was it up?
[22:34.26]Oh my god, I gotta get up and fucking shake my body
[22:41.00]I'm slower than I was yesterday.
[23:18.45]Okay, um, I'm gonna get up and shake as fucking hard as I can in a circle.
[23:24.42]I beat this- I beat this literally with my eyes closed yesterday.
[23:28.96]I went to sleep.
[23:30.24]I woke up.
[23:32.07]I'm on like a two or three day gamer cooldown apparently.
[23:35.71]Hold on.
[23:37.03]I gotta fucking get up and shake.
[23:47.75]I'm in, like, pajamas.
[23:48.72]Hold on.
[23:50.14]Yes, I just wear pajamas.
[23:56.52]Alright.
[24:00.16]Where's the fucking camera?
[24:03.38]You know what?
[24:03.76]This is gonna be embarrassing.
[24:10.47]I had to just put this on real quick.
[24:11.99]I put it there specifically in case I needed it.
[24:19.56]I haven't shaved either, I said I was gonna do that.
[24:24.12]Alright, so.
[24:32.21]Alright, that's enough?
[24:34.19]I think that was enough.
[24:38.25]I just like saw a spider on the ground.
[24:40.29]That's not warming up.
[24:41.27]Okay, let's go up in the air here.
[24:50.10]This way.
[24:51.44]That way.
[24:55.32]I'll spin around once.
[25:00.02]I feel worse.
[25:01.12]Like, way worse.
[25:07.59]How about if I... Do I have any fruits?
[25:13.27]Do I have any fruit?
[25:18.34]There are no sweat stains here.
[25:20.10]I just put this on.
[25:22.66]Do you understand?
[25:24.30]There's nothing here.
[25:25.48]There are no sweat stains.
[25:27.18]I'm certain of that.
[25:27.96]You know why I know that I'm certain of that?
[25:30.02]Because this shirt has only been worn like three times.
[25:34.21]I don't wear this in public.
[25:36.77]You know, I'll tell you why I don't wear it in public.
[25:38.41]We may have talked about it before.
[25:40.05]Number one reason why I don't wear this in public is the same reason why a doctor doesn't wear his lab coat out when he goes to get like food.
[25:47.79]You know, it's like, I, I, I'm... Hey, that's me!
[25:50.95]I'm a doctor!
[25:52.24]I don't... Hey, if you see... Go to that hospital!
[25:55.28]I'll treat you!
[25:59.44]Nah, same reason my doctor don't wear a doctor's outfit.
[26:04.90]Tape over the logo.
[26:10.42]Not the same thing?! !
[26:15.34]It's the exact same thing.
[26:17.30]It's the exact same thing.
[26:18.34]Alright.
[26:20.79]Preparing a streamer to a doctor.
[26:22.49]Guys, I really don't want to make you feel like potentially that you don't know this.
[26:29.89]There are a lot of streamers and a lot of YouTubers that make more money than some of the best surgeons in the world.
[26:39.36]And I know that might be horrible to hear about that.
[26:44.30]But, uh... Comparing Doctor to some streamers... The Doctor's probably just like... What?
[26:54.18]I go like this, and like, in people's fucking, like, brains and shit.
[26:59.20]That guy plays Fortnite?
[27:01.58]And he makes three times my income?
[27:13.11]I'm ready.
[27:33.37]Ten times, let's be honest.
[27:42.25]Here we go.
[27:42.57]What?
[28:04.60]What happened?
[28:06.40]Oh, my button.
[28:07.08]My button's fucked up.
[28:25.10]Yes, we've heard of the entertainment industry.
[28:27.24]Yeah, but somebody said streamers specifically.
[28:34.55]Like, Ben Affleck doesn't walk around in the Batman outfit.
[28:36.77]It'd be kind of weird if he did.
[28:49.62]He might.
[28:50.16]How do you know?
[28:50.74]He isn't Batman anymore.
[28:54.23]He doesn't want to be Batman anymore.
[29:04.21]Didn't he come out at an interview being like, I don't wanna do that anymore.
[29:10.80]How many costumes are there?
[29:17.08]Did I get a costume?
[29:23.71]So I think we're good.
[29:34.35]I'm gonna really pay attention.
[29:38.66]Some dude named Jeremy Elberton is the new Batman.
[29:43.16]Well, I mean, I am a streamer, so that means I have to be a billionaire, you know what I mean?
[30:03.54]Alright, report five.
[30:05.12]I'm not ready for this.
[30:05.92]I already, I know I'm not ready for this.
[30:07.56]Ah, fuck.
[30:09.44]Alright, come on.
[30:11.38]Just pay attention.
[30:13.76]I'm ready.
[30:15.00]Yeah, Michael Jackson is actually in this game.
[30:18.56]And he's standing right next to us.
[30:42.76]Alright.
[30:43.24]Focus.
[30:45.26]I did like the shake.
[30:46.28]I should be ready for this.
[30:47.14]Alright.
[30:50.16]Clean.
[31:14.36]It was so clean it smelt like goddamn Clorox.
[31:17.08]Let's go!
[31:18.50]Almost fucked it up.
[31:20.36]As clean as a goddamn bottle of Lysol!
[32:43.00]I was as clean as a goddamn bottle of detergent.
[33:01.80]Why do you have Grimace in your party?
[33:03.63]What?
[33:09.87]This one, alright.
[33:12.86]This one's, I couldn't, this was the wall last night for some reason.
[33:16.11]Let's do it.
[33:19.31]This is Persona.
[34:06.20]I did it.
[34:07.80]I made it.
[34:38.32]Stay tuned.
[34:42.87]That's got to be the midway point.
[34:46.71]We've come even deeper inside.
[34:49.43]I think this is the checkpoint.
[34:50.47]Help!
[34:55.94]You won't be going any further if you don't understand no.
[35:05.13]The shadows.
[35:05.71]Another band.
[35:08.56]No, this is not the one.
[35:09.74]Here we go.
[35:10.28]Yeah, I remember this.
[35:13.00]This is the battle of the band.
[35:15.08]I gotta beat this.
[35:16.68]I have to make it out of this.
[35:46.91]Come on, baby, that was just cleaning.
[35:48.25]There's a goddamn bottle up.
[35:51.43]Water.
[36:26.85]Those three.
[36:27.77]I keep missing the third one.
[36:29.21]Every time.
[36:29.92]I don't know why.
[37:00.18]I couldn't press it fast enough.
[37:46.17]I did it!
[37:46.59]I got it!
[37:47.03]I did it.
[37:47.29]I did it.
[37:47.77]Okay.
[37:48.59]I never got... I did it.
[37:49.43]This is the part where you gotta save the real one.
[37:54.81]I got it.
[38:03.90]And save him.
[38:05.22]Don't fuck this up.
[38:30.79]Come on, that's gotta be it, right?
[39:03.91]Yes!
[39:04.77]Can't be much more after that.

[40:13.67]That's the best I've ever had.
[40:16.11]That's the best rating I've had.
[40:29.81]Now he joins the team.
[40:40.19]Oh man, they messed up his face?
[40:41.43]What's wrong with his face?
[40:42.53]I didn't get a good look.
[40:43.47]Everything is wrong with everything.
[40:47.43]Not bad at all.
[41:11.78]We got another report I think after this, right?
[41:29.71]Mobile is delayed?
[41:30.73]I'm sorry to hear that.
[41:34.77]So I'm at the drive-thru, right?
[41:36.05]Three days ago.
[41:37.45]And I order a large Big Mac.
[41:40.95]Meal.
[41:42.59]And I can't... I'm not gonna talk over this one.
[41:45.13]Purge Report.
[42:12.60]This is report six, right?
[42:23.50]Got the whole team now.
[42:30.03]I love these, like, pointing.
[42:32.27]The walk point.
[42:43.35]Welcome to my very own TV show.
[42:46.27]Uh-oh.
[42:46.61]This antenna you gave me is working just great.
[42:48.97]This seems pretty end.
[42:50.05]Soon, this antenna will contain enough energy to force the whole galaxy to dance.
[42:54.89]Don't let it happen.
[42:57.10]Here we go.
[42:58.60]There is just no stopping it now.
[43:01.74]One, two, right, two.
[43:04.12]This is the end of the line.
[43:05.64]Left, G, right, G. Come on, with the power of the whole team.
[43:20.68]You had more... Not really good at ad-libbing, are you?
[43:29.41]Stage fright there.
[43:30.25]Oh, no!
[43:52.43]Come on, Michael!
[44:25.97]Get out of my face!
[44:38.48]That was as clean as a clean floor after!
[44:43.20]I don't know.
[44:43.80]It was a clean.
[44:44.76]It's very clean.
[44:54.25]It's so stupid.
[45:06.25]Why would you in the middle of your number there just go, hey?
[45:11.92]Got something better to throw at me?
[45:16.65]Mr. Sprinkle?
[45:17.45]What is his name?
[45:52.97]What?
[45:53.83]What did he say?
[45:57.63]What?
[45:59.97]What did he say?
[46:00.57]Is he down?
[46:07.88]Neck is broken.
[46:10.84]He just went... I don't know.
[46:13.72]He's down, apparently.
[46:16.43]Commence dance, Dimension X.

[46:58.09]Get out of here.
[46:59.97]Down.
[47:00.27]Did I lose?
[47:07.46]You won't mind if I pull the plug on your little show.
[47:10.64]Ooh la la!
[47:18.84]That was a very quick technical break.
[47:20.98]Uh oh.
[47:49.53]This is wonderful.
[47:51.21]Where's Michael?
[48:19.69]There he is.
[48:20.53]Come on, Yalala.
[48:50.09]Give him your power!
[48:51.73]What's happening?
[48:53.01]This isn't what my top search says.
[49:40.50]That's it, right?
[49:42.82]91%!
[49:42.86]Holy shit!
[49:51.13]I got 100% on level.
[49:51.63]I can't... I fucked up that part in the middle.
[50:12.37]It's hard to do that.
[50:30.49]Choo, choo, choo.
[50:32.21]Sing together.
[50:33.86]Choo, choo, choo.
[50:35.50]La, la, la, la.
[50:37.16]Choo, choo, choo.

[50:43.85]Choo, choo, choo.
[50:45.47]Boom, boom.
[51:07.32]All at once.
[51:08.50]Oh, he said Red Dead Redemption 2 music.
[51:14.62]Well, that's how you get better than purpose.
[51:32.35]We're in a full motion cutscene.
[51:35.59]Again, not very good at ad-lib.
[52:11.81]Not 200%.
[52:22.39]See you next week!
[52:25.57]Purge's evil plan to dance the galaxy mad has come to an end.
[52:30.59]Now, happy days are indeed here again.
[52:34.17]I'm Ulala, broadcasting along with all my friends here.
[52:39.00]Raise Channel 5!
[52:40.36]You were the hottest in the whole galaxy, girl.
[52:44.43]Are we still going?
[52:58.42]Alright, now.
[53:01.55]I got some things to say.
[53:03.63]I got a few things to say.
[53:12.39]Look at how much fun everybody's having.
[53:14.73]Alright, there it is.
[53:15.83]But that's not the end.
[53:18.65]It's not unusual.
[53:19.93]Is this Tom, what's his name?
[53:21.87]Tom Hardy.
[53:22.25]Tom, what's his name?
[53:23.15]Tom Love?
[53:23.63]Tom Hardy, no, Tom Jones.
[53:24.49]To be loved by anyone.
[53:47.76]So this is Sonic Team, right?
[53:49.10]Yes.
[53:49.26]So they made two of these games.
[53:52.87]And they made like 25 Sonic the Hedgehog games.
[54:10.46]This was such a delight.
[54:12.20]This game is an absolute delight.
[54:19.66]And yes, they are making another one.
[54:21.54]It's coming out soon for VR.
[54:25.17]But... It's not Sonic Team, but a lot of the Sonic Team devs.
[54:29.35]Oh, okay.
[54:33.59]It was a Space Channel port for a Game Boy.
[54:37.03]This is just so fun and whimsical and wonderful.
[54:40.35]Why not make this a more elaborate franchise?
[54:44.47]Did nobody buy it?
[54:48.01]Nobody invested so badly or something.
[54:52.58]It just doesn't suck.
[54:56.20]And it was on Dreamcast.
[54:58.96]Yeah.
[54:59.80]It kind of sits in a weird spot, doesn't it?
[55:08.38]Jerma by the rights it'd be great to see another uh ooh la la adventure I really hope the VR game is not just a goofy gimmick that lasts like 30 minutes
[55:35.94]There are some bonus modes and bonus levels, so... We're not done with Space Channel 5.
[55:46.96]SEGA, please give more Space Channel... Jet Set, Samba, Nights, Julie Hatcher... Yeah, there's so many different IPS that are... good.
[56:01.16]Is Sonic the Hedgehog the only thing that they are confident that they can make that somebody will buy?
[56:08.93]What else?
[56:09.79]Didn't SEGA just put their money behind something recently?
[56:14.29]That was not something like... What did they just do?
[56:18.13]They've done something... Yakuza, right, yeah.
[56:31.51]Sonic, Yakuza, and Football Manager.
[56:35.15]Rhythm Heaven?
[56:35.71]Yeah, I would love Rhythm Heaven.
[56:39.13]Alright, let's see what the bonus content is.
[56:49.10]I was actually looking for... I think these rhythm games are a ton of fun.
[56:55.85]But this is kind of equal parts rhythm game and Simon Says.
[57:01.75]You know, needing no prompts.
[57:05.19]It's a little different than most rhythm games.
[57:06.83]Do I have to turn off the console here?
[57:13.43]That doesn't exist?
[57:18.43]We just got an endless string of robots running.
[57:26.65]Do I just have to wait till the James Bond music is over?
[57:41.82]Alright, so get on your radar here.
[57:44.53]We're gonna play Rhythm Heaven.
[57:46.53]I'm gonna find a way to play that.
[57:48.43]That's DS though, isn't it?
[57:49.53]I'm gonna have to get like a modded DS.
[58:01.82]Is there one for the Wii?
[58:06.27]The rhythm happening on Wii is good.
[58:07.57]Okay.
[58:08.09]I have a 3DS, so I'll figure it out.
[58:09.41]Oh, and I have... I don't have a Wii anymore, though.
[58:11.76]I gave that away.
[58:34.41]I'll just point the webcam at the DS.
[58:39.20]Alright, I wanna do, like, the bonus mode.
[58:44.60]Can we get away from this, like, loading screen?
[58:51.27]There he is.
[58:52.33]Doing the walk.
[58:54.01]Step.
[58:55.57]Left.
[58:55.93]It's, it's, remember I told you?
[58:57.73]It's right foot, left hand.
[59:00.19]Left foot, right hand.
[59:03.15]where do you think I got it from what what what what happened what what what was it was it up oh my god it was up give me a break
[59:29.45]Alright, here we go.
[59:30.17]We got Lulala's Dance.
[59:34.25]Non-stop 100 round battle.
[59:37.07]What's the best costume?
[59:46.56]There are 40 costumes.
[59:49.82]Dirty retro gear.
[59:51.10]How do I get that?
[59:55.69]Clear 24 consecutive trials in dance mode.
[59:58.39]Clear all 100.
[60:00.58]Clear report 1 with a rating of 100%.
[60:04.88]Be in the game for over 3 hours.
[60:07.94]Well, I got it.
[60:08.76]That's ugly.
[60:12.83]You gotta clear with 100%.
[60:13.45]Clear 34.
[60:13.59]Okay, we gotta do dance mode.
[60:28.53]Looks like a little character selector.
[60:34.95]There's Michael Jackson.
[60:36.85]Space Michael.
[60:41.87]Alright, let's do it.
[60:45.35]This is just a hundred rounds.
[60:46.98]Let's see what I can do.
[60:52.10]It's just Ulala's dance.
[61:17.49]Alright, level one complete.

[72:26.36]But like, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, down.
[72:31.58]It's like, oh, fuck, how many was that?
[72:34.32]And I was just getting old.
[72:36.00]Oh, I can't believe it.
[72:37.34]It was it.
[72:44.14]Oh, shit.
[72:46.58]No, it's so long.
[72:48.80]Oh, it was so close.
[72:58.36]Damn it.
[72:58.72]Hold on.
[72:59.06]Wait.
[72:59.22]I think I got like three achievements.
[73:01.22]Can I get any more costumes?
[73:11.26]There it is.
[73:26.74]100 trials.
[73:27.30]Oh, I'm so sad.
[73:28.36]I'm so disappointed.
[73:32.87]I'm so sad.
[73:33.95]What else we got?
[73:38.19]Can I... Let me see.
[73:41.61]Hold on.
[73:42.05]Can I do it in, like, different mode?
[73:48.39]I guess not.
[73:48.87]I thought that was, like, a hard mode.
[73:55.24]100% stage one.
[73:56.01]Okay.
[73:59.93]Toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto, toto.
[74:03.77]Down.
[74:05.87]And what happened was... In my head, I was like, oh, that's hard.
[74:10.24]I'm gonna count the next ones.
[74:11.44]And I counted wrong.
[74:12.62]Instead of just doing it by the beat.
[74:14.90]Alright, let's... I'm gonna 100% level one.
[74:19.87]Hello, space cats.
[74:21.19]On today's edition of Oolala's Report Show, we bring you up-close coverage of an unidentified space troop which attacked this very spaceship.
[74:28.09]Oolala, be on your guard.
[74:29.79]Roger.
[74:30.19]Huh?
[74:30.59]A curious man just ahead.
[74:32.69]The groove's getting on.
[74:35.51]Here we go.
[74:40.95]Watch me bust some moves.
[74:43.44]I'm so sad, I had it.
[74:44.80]Oh, I can't get over it.
[75:21.79]won't be sad.
[75:46.05]Up, down, up, down, choo-choo-choo!
[76:14.24]Can you imagine how impressed we'd be if you beat it?
[76:16.93]I know.
[76:18.07]That's in my mind too.
[76:19.73]I got so close.
[76:20.49]And that was just the first... It's okay.
[76:32.05]I tried.
[76:32.55]It's all you can do.
[76:34.75]All you can do is try.
[76:44.19]I fucking god damn it.
[76:45.81]This is what happens when... This is what happens.
[77:05.14]You know what I'm gonna get?
[77:06.84]I'm telling you, you know what I'm gonna get?
[77:08.80]I'm gonna buy like gamer fucking baby wipes.
[77:13.00]You know what I mean?
[77:13.44]I'm going to get a packet of baby wipes that I'm just going to have here.
[77:16.76]It's going to just... I'm just going to put them all over my fucking hands with the controller.
[77:19.96]Because this is wet.
[77:24.56]I need gamer wipes.
[77:26.26]Baby gamer wipes.
[77:27.96]No.
[77:28.34]You know what I mean though.
[77:31.37]God damn it.
[77:36.53]I pressed up.
[77:37.69]And before I could press up, my like...
[77:40.70]frog chameleon hands, like, slipped over it and, like, pressed above it.
[77:45.68]Fuck.
[77:45.92]I need, like, baby wipes over here.
[77:47.28]No, but the baby wipes would make a... I need, like, a drying agent.
[77:51.00]Like, baking powder or something to, like, put all over... I'm gonna... Okay.
[78:09.93]I need the thing in the Olympics.
[78:14.30]We already- I talked about this already.
[78:16.48]Like, three years ago.
[78:21.00]Chalk, and you like- We talked about that already.
[78:26.62]Didn't I make this reference, like, more than two or three years ago?
[78:28.99]I already did, so just imagine I said it again.
[78:33.57]I need baby powder.
[78:35.89]All over my fucking stuff.
[78:48.31]Oh yeah, I actually even dibbed it.
[78:49.30]Yeah, I put baby powder all over my hand.
[78:50.88]Oh yeah, because of Cuphead.
[78:55.60]Beat that game on stream, by the way.
[79:05.73]I'm too obsessed with this game.
[79:07.57]I have to 100% some of it.
[79:26.11]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:28.77]Good, good, good.
[79:31.13]Up, down, up, down.
[79:32.57]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:33.53]Up, down, up, down.
[79:34.61]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:35.96]Up, down, up, down.
[79:37.44]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:39.04]Up, down, up, down.
[79:40.48]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:41.36]Up, down, up, down.
[79:42.72]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:44.30]Up, down, up, down.
[79:45.56]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:46.80]Up, down, up, down.
[79:47.87]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:49.65]Up, down, up, down.
[79:50.97]Choo, choo, choo.
[79:52.37]Up, down, up, down.
[79:54.37]Alright, let's do it.
[79:56.39]Ooh la la!
[79:58.37]Here it comes!
[80:26.17]Okay, let's go.
[80:26.81]Yes, I know.
[80:28.53]I know what directions are.
[81:01.09]Press B when you hear, hey!
[81:30.56]Save them all!
[81:31.74]Save them all!
[82:01.19]Am I even gonna get 100%?
[82:36.89]The space guide is taking it from the dance ground.
[82:40.57]Help me.
[82:43.86]You should be taken seriously.
[82:46.30]Listen up.
[82:47.24]First, our name.
[82:49.80]Get down.
[82:50.62]We are known as the rhythm roll.
[82:53.78]Choo, choo, choo.
[82:55.62]We are fool, let's not anymore.
[83:00.47]Choo, choo, choo, choo.
[83:08.84]Hey!
[83:09.02]Hey!
[83:09.64]So I can't get a hundred percent, I'm missing something.
[83:13.84]Right, right, left, left, choo, choo, choo.
[83:17.93]So where are the secret timings?
[83:42.70]During the transitions?
[83:45.45]So, where are they?
[84:10.15]There are secrets in the cut scene, so I can't get 100%.
[84:12.58]Hold on.
[84:12.74]This one.
[84:24.30]So where are they?
[84:25.64]Okay.
[84:26.80]Somebody said this like... On today's edition of Ulala's Report Show, we bring you up-close coverage of an unidentified dance troupe which attacked this very spaceship.
[84:35.14]Ulala, be on your guard.
[84:36.85]Roger.
[84:37.37]Huh?
[84:37.63]A curious man just ahead.
[84:40.35]Was there... The groove's getting on!
[84:48.01]Watch me bust some moves.
[84:50.47]And copy me with no mistakes.
[84:53.25]I don't see any prompts or anything.
[85:00.41]I missed it.
[85:01.27]Already missed it.
[85:08.92]Character pro... It's a rule of thumb anytime she winks at the camera.
[85:13.28]Hold on.
[85:14.80]Why would a secret have a...
[85:21.98]It's in the first three notes?
[85:23.44]Okay, so I... I apparently just got it.
[85:24.78]What?
[85:45.85]How the hell would you ever do that?
[85:49.67]How would you ever know where those were?
[85:51.19]I guess.
[85:51.57]Okay.
[85:57.35]I got 1%.
[85:57.63]Just use the guide.
[85:58.63]Okay.
[85:58.83]I'm fucking...
[86:12.99]So what is the highest percent you can get just simply being in the game?
[86:19.81]There will be three horn beats at the beginning of the stage.
[86:22.01]On the second horn, when Ulala points to the left of the screen, press a button at the split second, you hear the horn.
[86:30.00]Then there will be three horn beats at the very beginning of the stage.
[86:32.64]On the third horn beat, when Ulala points forward and the screen moves away, after the
[86:44.13]So that's 2.
[86:53.53]Oh my god.
[87:03.04]That is 2%.
[87:06.10]After the first battle... I didn't hear a horn.
[87:12.11]After the first battle with Shadow, you will save two rich people, in quotes.
[87:16.79]After the rescue, all three of you will do a quick dance, then pause, striking a pose.
[87:21.77]Just as they strike a pose, and they pause briefly, hit a button.
[87:27.45]Hit like a button.
[87:30.64]Okay, so when we get the rich people, when we save, they're going to do a pose.
[87:41.02]Which button?
[87:42.16]I think it's the A button.
[87:47.68]Just hit your favorite button.
[87:51.34]Wait, is this it?
[87:53.92]No, then you say, okay, after the rescue, you will all do a dance and then pose.
[87:57.98]Right when they strike the pose, hit A.
[88:04.58]Fuck this up.
[88:05.36]Just spam A during the transitions.
[88:07.30]Don't make me laugh right now.
[88:09.28]This is not the time to make me laugh.
[88:43.98]That is a legit strategy.
[89:04.66]Choo, choo, choo.
[89:07.34]Great dancing.
[89:08.50]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:12.12]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:13.70]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:16.87]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:19.87]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:22.87]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:25.33]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:28.19]Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
[89:30.93]Up, down, up, down.
[89:34.36]Alright, you rich people.
[89:35.72]Can we strike a pose?
[89:47.17]What?
[89:47.49]I did it!
[89:48.21]I did!
[89:48.73]I... I hit A when they did a pose.
[89:52.25]They did like... I pressed A.
[90:03.97]I didn't do the timing?
[90:05.91]What timing?
[90:11.17]We're gonna go with the original Burgah Boy technique.
[90:14.45]Here we go.
[90:14.73]It doesn't work.
[90:19.93]It doesn't work.
[90:32.08]Damn, why?
[90:35.64]Alright, even timing it to try to do it correctly.
[90:39.04]You can't spam it.
[90:53.99]Ooh la la, you can go home now.
[91:06.39]Wasn't there a hard mode?
[91:07.74]Or do I have to 100% every level to do the hard mode?
[91:09.40]Alright.
[91:47.06]He's torturing himself again.
[91:48.78]I'm not.
[91:52.08]He's torturing himself.
[92:17.71]We just need to pass it.
[92:19.25]I don't care about perfect timing.
[92:22.97]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo.
[92:26.57]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo.
[92:30.45]Up, right, left.
[92:58.61]Alright.
[93:13.94]Alright, let's go.
[93:15.76]Alright, let's go.
[93:16.56]Let's go.
[93:16.82]Alright, this is the one.
[93:17.92]Let's go.
[93:19.56]Alright, let's go.
[93:20.88]Right.
[93:21.50]Up, up, down, down.
[93:23.10]Woof, woof, woof.

[93:51.45]Right, right, right
[94:18.96]The colors are blending into my brain together, I think.
[94:22.72]It's not hard.
[95:03.64]on the cat time for meows and then Toyota and then Honda yeah
[95:37.75]Up, up, down, down.
[95:40.15]Up, up, down, down.

[96:18.89]Toyota.
[96:19.51]Up, left, right, down.
[97:01.38]Just playing, this is digital bop it.
[97:03.14]Eventually, eventually you're gonna hit the fucking twist when you're supposed to pulp.
[97:06.28]It's gonna happen.
[97:18.57]Up, down, down, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.
[97:20.59]Up, Georgia, up, Georgia, up, Georgia.

[97:57.30]Come on, I can do it.
[97:58.68]I know I can.
[97:59.72]Almost there.
[98:28.41]I pressed- I- I like kind of had to take my- oh god damn it.
[98:58.30]I'm going like this for like eight straight minutes during that.
[99:01.98]Just going... And your brain and your body eventually just have to like... And then I just go... Damn it.
[99:17.30]My hair is white.
[99:21.16]You can continue from the middle.
[99:24.98]I really should just close my eyes.
[99:39.62]How do I start from the middle?
[99:43.52]No, this isn't the thing.
[99:52.46]Alright, let's try it.
[100:02.61]Hold on, let me move this.
[100:03.39]Just so I can prove that my eyes are closed.
[100:21.60]You think this will work?
[100:27.71]I'm just going to lean back in my chair.
[101:00.22]I need the visual.
[101:01.54]I think I need... No, I need the visual.
[101:04.10]I need the visual.
[101:14.19]It's like... I have to see the hands moving.
[101:25.71]Mute it.
[101:28.87]I can't mute it.
[101:33.29]Coward journalist.
[101:36.65]I got it now.
[101:37.23]It's over.
[101:42.55]It says continue from midway.
[101:43.73]It doesn't work.
[101:45.87]I just tried it.
[101:55.11]Mute the rhythm game.
[102:00.83]See, I need that.
[102:08.39]Seeing his hands go up and down.
[102:23.06]After you pass 50- no, we got to 93% last time.
[102:27.24]I think this is like the first of a few different levels.
[102:50.05]Nah, everything's scrambled in my mind now.
[102:53.48]Like, I'm reading chat.
[102:54.98]I'm like looking at fucking the OBS settings.
[102:57.32]I'm like taking a sip of my coffee.
[102:58.84]I gotta like put my brain into the game.
[103:06.49]Alright, I'm gonna do it one more time.
[103:07.71]Look.
[103:10.51]See?
[103:11.77]It doesn't matter.
[103:17.01]See?
[103:22.15]I was so close that first time.
[103:23.55]Alright, here we go.
[103:24.17]I'm going in and I'm gonna just be silent and stare at the screen.
[103:27.62]I'm turning off the other monitors.
[103:29.64]No, I can't.
[103:41.53]What the fuck is in my throat?
[104:21.55]Let's go.
[104:22.39]Here we go.
[104:23.75]Alright, go.
[104:54.18]Up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo!
[104:59.08]Right, right, shoo, shoo, shoo!
[105:01.22]Right, right, shoo, shoo, shoo!
[105:05.84]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo!
[105:12.41]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo!
[105:17.69]Up, up, down, down, woof, woof, woof!
[105:43.81]What the fuck, oh my god, I don't understand.
[105:46.45]Oh, I had, oh, man.
[105:54.51]I can't, I almost beat this first and then second try.
[105:57.22]And we're slowly going down the mountain where, like, up, down, left, right, A, B, Honda, Toyota, cat, meow, dog, they're all the same thing in my brain at the moment now.
[106:08.00]It's like,
[106:09.74]Ah.
[106:14.64]Shit.
[106:17.34]It's so bad because when you get so close... I just had to do one last little string and it was just too much.
[106:26.61]Take a break, play Dynamite Cop and come back.
[106:28.75]Yeah, that's what happened last time.
[106:31.71]Remember last night I couldn't get past the level 5?
[106:36.82]Came back and first tried it.
[106:37.90]Perfect.
[106:39.54]Yeah, we'll come back.
[106:40.54]We'll come back.
[106:40.95]We'll come back.
[106:41.37]After this one.
[107:43.00]What's the premise of this game?
[107:43.92]The premise of the game is you press button in-beat.
[107:49.25]It's digital Simon Says with Bop It mixed in.
[107:55.56]up right left down right
[108:37.53]stop reading oh I turned the monitor I turned the chat monitor off
[109:05.39]Right, left, woof, woof, woof!
[109:06.96]Right, left, right, left, woof, woof!
[109:08.66]Ooh la la, you can go home now.
[109:16.74]I tell you, I... Fuckin' me!
[109:19.21]Fuckin' me up and... Alright.
[109:25.83]That was the second time I got there and fucked that part up.
[109:28.96]Because of... It's gotta be... This is so precise.
[109:32.56]I fucking beat it the first time.
[109:34.24]But I fucking didn't beat it.
[109:37.60]And there's like a devil.
[109:39.70]There's a devil sitting right here.
[109:41.06]I don't know if you guys get this with YouTube.
[109:44.14]Does this happen to anybody else?
[109:48.29]Tell me if I'm crazy enough, but let's say you get to a hard part of the game, right?
[109:53.79]And it's the first time you got there, and you kick the thing's ass.
[109:58.15]You do so well.
[109:59.71]Everything's going great.
[110:00.46]Oh, that was really fucking hard.
[110:02.02]And then you lose right at the moment where you had confidence that you were going to beat it, right?
[110:07.20]All of a sudden, there he is.
[110:08.98]You know, you're not going to beat that.
[110:10.48]You're not going to fucking beat this.
[110:11.68]Like, you already got to this point at 93%.
[110:15.28]You got so close and you failed.
[110:17.29]It's just like, get the fuck up, man.
[110:18.55]I'm trying to do the level.
[110:25.96]You guys get that?
[110:30.08]And then the angel, the angel's this tall.

[111:03.48]Let's go play Crazy Taxi.
[111:12.34]Look at how far you got.
[111:13.48]You got to 93%.
[111:16.76]Oh, good one.
[111:17.50]You did a really good string there.
[111:20.18]No, it wasn't as good as the first time, though, was it?
[111:23.14]No, it wasn't as good as the first time.
[111:24.28]You're right.
[111:25.14]Hey, you just looked at chat, didn't you?
[111:26.54]Yeah, I did just look at chat.
[111:27.56]Why are you doing that?
[111:29.34]You're just not going to be able to do this.
[111:31.34]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[111:32.20]That's right.
[111:32.86]I know.
[111:33.10]That's right.
[111:33.40]I keep telling you.
[111:38.18]Let's go play Crazy Taxi.
[111:55.13]Get S's.
[111:56.01]No, I'm not going to get S's in Crazy Taxi.
[112:05.90]Wait, Jerma, no more taxis.
[112:13.45]But that always happens when I do very well the first time I attempt something, and then I don't do well for a couple of attempts, and then it's just like, well, I've expelled all of my fluid apparently.
[112:26.59]No, no, no, get off my shoulder.
[112:29.71]Oh my God, did you hear that?
[112:30.71]He's talking to me still.
[112:33.22]Why does this look like this?
[112:34.10]Now this is very loud.
[112:35.34]That's better.
[112:35.74]I probably should change this to Crazy Taxi Cooldown.
[113:11.91]crazy tax so by the way something I didn't know about crazy taxi they have a version of this on iPad and it's like an I it's an idling gameplay the last jedi
[113:41.82]Alright, actually, you know what, speaking of cooldowns, let me, let me go get, let me get a glass of water.
[113:45.20]It's been about two hours.
[113:46.38]Let me get a water.
[113:48.51]And we're gonna do a crazy taxi cooldown period.
[113:51.73]I'll be right back.
[113:56.35]Alright, somebody, let me just, okay.
[113:59.56]Somebody said no water.

[118:04.98]Go, Gus.
[118:13.13]Please mod the music in.
[118:15.04]You want me to go to jail?
[118:19.48]You don't want me to go to prison, do you?
[118:31.81]Let's see if I can get... Can Lightning Strike twice with me here?
[118:42.00]I missed it already, but it's alright.
[118:51.63]I'm getting a lot of damage.
[118:53.55]Alright, I gotta remember the controls.
[118:54.77]He's gonna be streaming from prison.
[119:08.64]Hey, guys, I have an idea.
[119:10.00]Let me play a game to, like, just relax for, like, a half an hour or so, and then go back and try to do... How does this crazy taxi sound?
[119:20.23]It has it in the title.
[119:28.09]Alright, let's try it again.
[119:33.08]It's the devil.
[119:35.28]Yeah, the devil made me do it.
[119:40.47]Okay, none of this did the devil make me do that.
[119:43.31]While I wasn't looking, he, like, Galaga Watermelon Smashed the angel's head with a mallet.
[120:02.38]And he hired his own pretend angel that he controls that just wears the white
[120:10.50]And has, like, fake angel wings.
[120:11.86]Don't pick up the... There you go.
[120:20.68]So what you're gonna do is you're gonna tell him... You're gonna tell him, whispering in his right ear, to play Crazy Taxi.
[120:26.07]He thinks he's gonna be, like, calming down and, like, cooling down?
[120:29.61]What a fucking idiot.
[120:33.03]And he's gonna, like, rage quit that game, too?
[120:37.22]Oh, it'll be scrumptious!
[120:48.47]No, I'm good.
[120:54.29]Oh, that's the one that baits you.
[120:57.35]The fucking devil made me do that.
[121:04.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not reverse.
[121:07.79]Oh, come on.
[121:12.90]Still salvageable.
[121:13.66]I can still get more than 6,000.
[121:14.53]You get 3 bucks.
[121:31.51]3 bucks.
[121:31.97]5 bucks.
[121:35.03]Get out.
[121:38.90]Install the old music mod.
[121:40.62]I...
[121:43.87]You really want me to like, you really want me to turn the game off.
[121:47.02]Go download a mod.
[121:49.02]Go install the mod.
[121:54.02]That's gonna like derail the stream for the next like 12 straight minutes.
[122:01.81]What the fuck are you trying to point me at?
[122:07.29]I might as well just play the YouTube video of the music.
[122:22.01]What's going on with the car?
[122:24.59]Alright, next chance I get, I'll do it.
[122:39.72]Where are the angels?
[122:40.68]Where are my angels?
[123:01.90]I love the rollercoaster tycoon.
[123:03.44]I'm on a rollercoaster scream.
[123:06.76]It's a really nice touch.
[123:07.64]I don't want to pick that person up.
[123:10.64]I really don't want to pick either one of you up.
[123:12.38]Right here.
[123:18.84]Gotta go back to the Marine Plaza.
[123:20.22]Alright, drive the car.
[123:37.89]Up and over.
[123:39.91]And then bank!
[123:42.61]Don't get baited.
[123:44.41]There we go.
[123:49.23]Not terrible so far.
[123:50.91]Could be a lot better.
[123:51.65]Why is that guy standing up in the car?
[124:00.34]Because he's fucking crazy.
[124:03.85]And he wants a thrill.
[124:20.05]I'm not gonna get there.
[124:23.42]Just go!
[124:24.88]I can at least get to 33.
[124:27.48]It's possible.
[124:28.18]Depends on if I can pick somebody up right here.
[124:34.54]I don't know if it's possible.
[124:41.82]I'm not going the wrong way.
[124:45.15]Boost it.
[124:53.04]Sir!
[124:53.26]3600, I'll take it.
[124:54.18]It'll be B. Good.
[124:56.04]Always 21st.
[124:56.92]Always.
[124:57.38]Okay, I will go- I'm gonna go get the song that everybody wants me to go get.
[125:02.50]And then I'm gonna go to prison.
[125:31.74]So what is it called?
[125:33.38]Just original... Crazy Taxi OST.
[125:47.29]Is this what you want?
[125:56.88]Is this what you guys want?
[125:59.12]This is the one?
[126:03.28]Okay.
[126:10.51]Link in chat.
[126:11.05]Well, do the mod.
[126:12.39]Why would I need to do the mod?
[126:18.19]If I have the video right here that's like, use the mod.
[126:22.95]Why?
[126:23.25]That doesn't make any sense.
[126:36.30]It makes the sounds better.
[126:42.88]Okay.
[126:47.31]So, let me spend the next 15 minutes installing a mod to Crazy Taxi.
[126:58.44]Are we for real about this?
[127:08.06]Okay.
[127:23.21]Also, stream your Windows 10 updates.
[127:27.65]I think I'm going to have to put a veto on this.
[127:33.26]I just want to play the game.
[127:39.66]Go get the original sound effects.
[127:42.36]I'll make them with my fucking mouth.
[127:51.39]This is like a bunch of Dropbox files.
[127:54.53]There are like three.
[127:58.47]There are like four, five Dropbox files here.
[128:10.91]let me get them alright they're in I just like click drag that one's in okay so this one's like this one's a black bag I gotta like get into the mainframe on this one that one's in okay I think we're good to go let's let's test it and see if it works
[128:54.51]Yeah, there we go, it works.
[128:56.11]Good.
[128:56.53]Alright, let's go.
[129:02.56]It worked.
[129:03.42]Pretty good soundtrack.
[129:43.91]It actually makes you play better, too!
[129:51.55]Stop the car!
[130:19.05]Why is my framerate just dying?
[130:21.59]That's kind of annoying.
[130:28.17]That wasn't this framerate-y yesterday.
[130:29.83]I got baited again.
[130:38.76]No, no, I didn't.
[130:39.42]No, this is different.
[130:40.08]This is Lighthouse.
[130:54.43]I think it's the mods.
[130:55.19]Yeah, these mods are all fucked up.
[130:59.30]It's slowing my game down.
[131:00.42]It's giving frame rate issues.
[131:03.62]What the heck?
[131:07.30]Something happened.
[131:08.14]Oh, the mod had to load the next song.
[131:14.86]Fucking goddammit.
[131:33.43]Now I love the framerate fixed mod.
[131:38.04]I'm sure something like that exists.
[131:44.30]I know what this is.
[131:44.96]0-0-0!
[132:15.79]Pretty good soundtrack though.
[132:21.20]The music usually stops right now?
[132:22.68]That's weird.
[132:27.95]Maybe this is like a continuous mod.
[132:39.90]Alright, this is gonna be the one.
[132:55.87]Forget about drifts.
[132:56.55]Let's try to make some time.
[132:57.67]I didn't get tipped for that?
[133:19.92]Cross straight.
[133:25.46]Do I have to turn the car around?
[133:26.62]I might.
[133:50.55]So many cars on that fucking road.
[133:58.38]Alright, this YouTube video is actually making my framerate drop.
[134:03.06]I swear to God.
[134:04.52]Sorry, whatever.
[134:05.50]I don't care.
[134:08.56]The video on my other monitor is making the framerate of the game suffer.
[134:16.97]He's been exposed.
[134:20.55]The devil made me do it, I don't care.
[134:24.96]Fucking goddamn YouTube video.
[134:27.94]It's like Flash Player playing in the background.
[134:31.48]Dragging my framerate down to like fuckin' 18.
[134:45.57]You can't live without the DEVIL.
[134:49.17]Are you guys the devil in that scenario?
[134:56.57]Ah, I tried to get funky with it.
[135:04.25]It's HTML5?
[135:12.31]Whatever it is, it hogs resources.
[135:29.00]No, we're only doing like a few rounds anyways.
[135:34.83]You guys realize that even if I installed the mod, you would only hear probably three songs.
[135:38.93]The ones that you just heard.
[135:41.63]I'm not going to play Crazy Taxi for, like, another three hours.
[135:43.83]This is just to get my brain off of Space Channel.
[135:48.11]I don't think so.
[135:54.49]Game over.
[136:16.27]Really?
[136:16.69]All you guys are going to be like this right now?
[136:19.49]How many devils have moved into my house?
[136:22.15]First it was just the big collector's edition one.
[136:25.27]Angel's gone.
[136:26.99]How many devils are here?
[136:34.78]You guys are on my couch.
[136:36.14]You're eating food out of my fridge.
[136:41.08]You're using my toothbrush.
[136:46.35]Laughin' and high-fivin' each other?
[136:47.88]You haven't changed the category on Twitch yet.
[136:54.16]Yeah, I did.
[136:55.64]Refresh.
[136:57.22]It's Crazy Taxi Cooldown.
[137:03.02]You're out of toilet paper.
[137:04.02]You guys are like shittin' in my toilet.
[137:09.03]Duck versus, you just beat, you're driving by and beeping at me?
[137:22.67]Shit was already there when I started.
[137:35.98]It's all part of the plan.
[137:38.48]He's gonna fucking be so angry.
[137:40.90]He'll never complete Space Channel 5 on this stream.
[137:53.96]And I'm going like this with my hands!
[138:08.15]I'm so evil!
[138:19.87]New evil emote.
[138:21.05]That's not an emote.
[138:44.76]I'm trying to get money I actually got a lot of money
[139:04.62]Although, somehow I took a wrong turn.
[139:19.34]Get over there!
[139:19.88]Come on!
[139:21.16]Oh my god, please.
[139:30.55]Am I even doing the boost right?
[139:32.75]How-
[140:04.89]Come here.
[140:13.71]Isn't it out of... into drive acceleration?
[140:16.70]Isn't that how it works?
[140:19.96]Or is it the same time?
[140:20.90]I still don't understand how that works.
[140:44.34]Yeah, I thought I was doing it right.
[140:46.52]The lack of All I Want by Offspring makes me sad.
[140:50.88]Hold on.
[140:51.28]Let me see.
[141:14.61]I want to just do 10 minutes, because I want to try to get this boost correct.
[141:21.74]It's in reverse, you shift into drive and hit accelerate.
[141:26.42]Yeah, so how am I doing it wrong sometimes?
[141:31.84]Do you have to be stopped for it to work?
[141:37.21]You have to be stopped, right?
[141:50.48]No.
[141:52.21]It definitely doesn't work when you're driving the car normally.
[142:08.10]You have to be like it stopped.
[142:20.07]I guess it doesn't work let's go
[142:48.84]Thank you for watching.
[143:06.80]So hold on, so why is it not working here?
[143:09.66]It is.
[143:10.04]I guess it's working.
[143:24.10]Alright.
[143:25.66]Let's try it again.
[143:33.78]So what is the difference between arcade and original?
[143:39.72]What's the difference?
[143:40.26]It's different.
[143:41.07]Spawn locations.
[143:41.95]Okay.
[143:42.49]That makes sense.
[143:44.79]We'll try it here.
[143:46.03]Alright.
[143:46.27]Why...
[144:08.79]I swear to god I did that the exact same way every time.
[144:30.14]What's going on down there?
[144:31.02]Why is the city destroyed?
[144:32.12]What the fuck?
[144:44.76]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[144:47.04]No, don't stop!
[144:48.02]Stay on the... This is a lot different.
[145:15.18]Fuck.
[145:17.04]Oh, so many cars are just in the way here.
[145:20.36]Some of them just parked on the side of the road.
[145:38.12]Really?
[145:38.44]What the fuck did I run into?
[145:49.65]I don't understand.
[146:25.73]I think I'm gonna lose.
[146:27.78]Have I thought about inviting Son Goku?
[146:40.52]Nah.
[146:41.70]Nah.
[146:47.48]Are you holding the Accelerator during the switch?
[146:50.64]I am not.
[146:56.54]I'm going into reverse, letting go, going into drive, pressing accelerate, like a half second later.
[147:04.59]Not even, like a tenth of a second later.
[147:22.58]thousandth of a second.
[147:31.16]That's rocket.
[147:39.97]Did I finish Resident Evil 2?
[147:41.21]I did.
[147:42.51]I finished Leon's campaign.
[147:45.87]It is done.
[147:47.05]I did not do the whole game, but...
[147:49.76]I'm not entirely sure I will.
[148:02.03]Claire B. There we go.
[148:10.97]Watch out for the other cars.
[148:14.94]Sir.
[148:24.44]No points for that.
[148:25.75]Come on.
[148:33.83]Not good.
[148:35.88]Not good.
[148:36.38]Not good.
[148:39.70]God damn it.
[148:42.50]Oh, God.
[148:43.32]Give me a break.
[148:56.54]It's alright 75 cents for a jump but we almost die and I'm gonna get like three dollars
[149:20.68]Fuck that guy.
[149:21.58]Went too fast.
[149:24.36]Jesus Christ.
[149:58.19]I don't know where I'm going, but apparently I went the right way.
[150:10.08]I have to.
[150:10.48]You're right here.
[150:10.96]That guy's just rocking out so hard.
[150:32.96]Bye.
[150:35.85]Come here!
[150:36.65]In!
[150:41.23]I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[150:42.41]Is this guy filming?
[150:44.75]Hey, turn off your livestream.
[150:51.56]It's alright.
[150:52.82]I'm getting the hang of the boost.
[151:03.65]How long does he need to cool down?
[151:05.19]I should have just played, like, Minesweeper.
[151:10.27]Alright, this is the last cooldown period, okay?
[151:14.35]This is it.
[151:15.81]Alright, let's get it on.
[151:24.09]And then I'm gonna beat it.
[151:28.06]Let's get this guy.
[151:30.00]I got S-ranking yesterday, I'm gonna get it right now.
[151:31.64]Here we go.
[151:40.36]He was, like, in an explosion.
[152:04.88]Nah, that just wasn't gonna happen.
[152:05.92]Fucking god game.
[152:13.41]Dude, tried it twice.
[152:16.43]Whatever.
[152:34.82]Straight ahead.
[152:43.61]Get in!
[152:55.52]Sprinted into a fucking tree.
[152:58.16]Oh, I'm so mad about that.
[152:59.54]That was a good turnaround too.
[153:03.23]Fuck.
[153:25.36]any of you popcorn mania popcorn mania there it is
[153:57.91]Where's a good pickup here?
[154:03.20]I mean, you're right here.
[154:03.96]I don't like this though.
[154:08.84]That was a bad spot to be in.
[154:27.89]Out.
[154:34.68]Thank god I just did that and turned around.
[154:37.96]There's an asshole in front of me though.
[154:44.72]Oh, you stupid fucking imbeciles in the road.
[154:53.65]Just throw fucking cards at random spawns everywhere.
[154:57.81]This is my road.
[155:19.55]Ugh!
[155:29.20]Back.
[155:39.49]Fucking parking lot.
[155:43.01]I think I just saved a few seconds though by doing that.
[155:45.43]Somehow.
[155:45.81]Oh my fucking god, they're everywhere!
[155:51.10]They're in every direction!
[156:19.29]Cut me off.
[156:19.93]I just got fucked cut off.
[156:22.48]What an asshole.
[156:31.13]Unbelievable.
[156:31.91]You need a break job, man.
[156:32.81]Seriously.
[156:58.30]In this game, your brakes are as effective as a fucking locomotive.
[157:03.84]It takes like four hours to stop this car.
[157:10.17]I might as well be on train tracks.
[157:12.13]Stop!
[157:54.36]Just don't crash?
[157:57.22]We're playing Crazy Taxi.
[158:01.01]You don't NOT crash.
[158:02.93]That's like part of the game.
[158:04.71]Is fucking being crazy.
[158:13.17]See?
[158:13.49]That guy's dead.
[158:15.07]Everybody in that car is dead.
[158:16.89]It's crazy.
[158:35.96]All those people, see?
[158:37.00]I can't control that.
[158:40.16]I can't control when the guy fucking drives into me.
[158:43.85]from across the pond.
[158:48.99]You know, the title of this game is not Moderately Fast Service Vehicle.
[159:02.76]No.
[159:30.11]Reasonable taxi.
[159:31.63]Yeah, when is that one coming out?
[159:43.62]That's a horror.
[159:44.28]I don't like that turn.
[159:48.12]That turn sucks.
[159:49.40]It just does.
[160:01.15]Oh, god.
[160:01.73]Alright, we're okay.
[160:08.17]What's the helicopter doing here?
[160:19.50]Oh!
[160:34.12]What is this arrow?
[160:53.60]Green.
[160:55.82]No, the guy dove out of the way that I wanted to pick up.
[161:15.89]What?
[161:16.21]Got it.
[161:35.05]Oh, fucking whatever.
[161:35.95]Just pick somebody up.
[161:56.03]Almost there.
[161:56.79]Alright.
[162:00.60]Marine pickup right ahead.
[162:08.46]YouTuber.
[162:15.01]Oh, I'm getting stuck.
[162:19.55]Not good.
[162:20.23]Very bad, actually.
[162:47.08]Oh, I hate this fucking game's directions.
[162:50.22]Give me a break, game.
[162:51.38]What the hell was that?
[163:15.03]Go this way.
[163:15.53]Go this way.
[163:16.07]Go this way.
[163:16.47]You're going the right way.
[163:17.11]Yeah, go this way.
[163:18.03]Go that way!
[163:41.77]Would you like to restart your computer now?
[163:43.23]I would not like to restart my computer.
[163:55.14]This is a pretty good title.
[164:40.72]anger field complaint to SEGA and he's got an angry review on like the Steam page so I got to a point where I need to do a u-turn and the arrow is pointing straight and then it turns around in a tenth of a second in the other direction and I'm trying to focus on not crashing into every car on the road and the frame rate by the way drops for all the time bad port I don't like it
[165:15.67]Should have got the mod.
[165:16.38]Alright, we cooled down a little bit from Crazy Taxi.
[165:28.04]Let's continue here.
[165:29.48]Let's go back.
[165:30.87]Had a small break there.
[165:31.83]Let's do Space Channel 5.
[165:35.89]This doesn't look right.
[165:45.20]Am I cooled?
[165:45.66]I'm pretty cooled down right now.
[165:46.76]I should've just like ate candy on stream.
[165:51.77]No, I should've just ate a whole bar of chocolate on stream.
[166:10.16]Alright, I'm ready now.
[166:10.87]I took a break.
[166:11.55]My muscle memory was able to get angry at Crazy Taxi.
[166:17.10]And get yelled at for no mods.
[166:19.32]This is easy to me.
[166:20.16]Look at how easy this is.
[166:43.32]Speed it up!
[166:45.22]Why are people doing MonkaS?
[167:18.92]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo.
[167:22.27]Up, down, up, down, shoo, shoo, shoo.
[167:24.79]Up, right, left, down, left.
[167:59.73]Cool.
[168:01.89]Let's see if I blow it in the same place every time.
[168:04.37]Get off my shoulder!
[168:15.30]That's it.
[169:00.92]What did I just tune into?
[169:02.56]The best stream on Twitch.
[169:04.73]I'm kidding.
[169:06.15]Probably the... It's...
[169:48.35]Bring on the cat.
[169:55.22]By the way, can I pause it?
[169:57.20]Okay, so somebody just said that I left for a while and came back and he's still doing this.
[170:02.96]Well, what happened was I did a cool down period in Crazy Taxi, which elevated my blood pressure because people... You guys can explain, right?
[170:15.37]But I just got here.
[170:16.53]This is the first attempt.
[170:17.61]Alright, so you understand?
[170:20.04]The cooldown period is over.
[170:21.26]Let's get this done.
[170:40.10]Up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[170:45.18]Up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[170:48.24]Up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[170:51.54]Up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[170:55.19]Up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[171:08.25]I love this silent streamer.
[171:10.82]It's the way it has to be.
[171:13.58]Otherwise, we'll never leave here.
[171:33.68]Right, down.
[171:35.45]Up, left, right, down.
[172:02.84]Ah!
[172:03.18]Shh!
[172:29.59]Hey.
[173:08.47]Choiza, choiza, choiza, choiza, choiza, choiza, choiza, choiza.
[174:14.44]It was fucked it up Oh
[174:40.69]Yeah.
[175:24.02]down right left
[175:55.97]up right down
[176:41.76]Get out of my fucking way!
[176:44.14]There's more.
[176:54.31]Oh.
[176:57.95]I just needed to cool down with a little crazy taxi.
[177:05.09]Um.
[177:08.45]What?
[177:21.05]That was more?
[177:58.39]Why don't you come over here and join me?
[178:19.01]What?
[178:19.33]No, no, no!
[178:20.13]I pressed it too quickly!
[178:21.17]It just, it, it, my boomer gamer old fuck hands just pressed it, I, I, oh, come on!
[178:33.63]My like slippery, old fucking greasy hands.
[178:40.23]Now I'm not gonna calm down.
[178:45.46]Oh, I wanted to just keep going.
[178:47.58]Damn it, why?
[178:48.58]I was sitting there for too long holding the controller.
[178:51.70]I just permeate liquid.
[178:53.56]Why does this happen to me?
[178:55.80]It's alright, I did it, I did it, it's alright, I did it.
[178:57.36]Let's see what the costume is.
[179:13.38]Which one is it?
[179:14.96]There it is.
[179:19.82]That's the costume.
[179:27.10]It's just like a vest.
[179:33.49]Oh, God.
[179:34.11]Clear 34 consecutive trials in dance mode while wearing the... Really?
[179:37.57]A suit.
[179:39.99]Do I have that?
[179:45.10]More than 10 hours playtime.
[179:47.06]I have to do it with this two-player mode.
[179:54.59]88-man suit.
[179:55.47]Boss Marillion suit.
[179:56.51]Marillion suit.
[180:01.49]Something will happen if you play Ulala's dance mode while wearing this suit.
[180:10.92]What'll happen?
[180:24.03]I didn't confirm the suit?
[180:29.28]Yeah, I did.
[180:35.18]Didn't confirm?
[180:51.27]Alright, so now I've confirmed it, right?
[180:55.99]Okay, what happens?
[181:19.44]So it is a different character.
[181:31.76]Stop playing this game, you fucking loser.
[181:35.24]What?
[181:36.32]Why did you say that?
[181:43.81]Now there is no midway point.
[181:52.79]I did it though, don't worry.
[181:54.39]I got to 100%.
[181:54.71]That's all that I needed to do.
[181:56.79]Is there anything else I can do in the game?
[182:08.90]The 100% stuff is sort of... I'm not interested.
[182:14.04]I don't want to have to pinpoint exact random secret timings.
[182:20.00]There is a Michael Jackson suit, is there really?
[182:31.35]So what's the Morolean suit?
[182:35.33]Like, how do you get the Morolean?
[182:41.82]The cheat command is printed inside the clothes.
[182:46.73]What?
[182:47.83]The cheat command?
[182:49.85]Grandma.
[183:04.21]Mr. Nervous.
[183:12.33]Save the neo-Japanese astronaut.
[183:17.85]Just body paint and color contacts.
[183:19.76]Well, we don't have the body paint suit, sorry guys.
[183:23.76]Noise costume, peace costume... Space Michael!
[183:31.62]No indication on how to get it.
[183:34.21]But they're a cheat code.
[183:35.27]There are cheat codes in that guy's clothes?
[183:36.77]Let's see if they are.
[183:43.59]Where are they?
[183:44.69]So this is the Morolian.
[183:51.86]Now wait a minute.
[183:57.94]You talk to people?
[184:03.47]Main characters, special characters.
[184:06.33]Okay.
[184:07.49]Where is this idiot?
[184:09.74]Ordinary folk.
[184:12.68]Rhythm rogues.
[184:17.07]Bosses.
[184:31.65]I've sent you a Crimson Rose.
[184:34.63]You need to get 100% and report 4.
[184:35.85]Okay, I see.
[184:41.25]Where was that dude that had the cheat codes?
[184:49.43]I've sent you a Green Onion.
[184:50.67]Check the changing room.
[185:02.18]green onion this is the green onion suit coconut lala I don't clear 53 oh I did it oh it's just a tan
[185:39.73]When you want that manly feeling.
[185:43.71]Using the kitchen investigation.
[185:45.19]So what, do you just get... hints for the costumes?
[186:01.00]Crimson Rose.
[186:02.44]Laced with Jaguar's passion, this rose will never die.
[186:04.84]Oh, it's just a microphone.
[186:07.10]It was the onion.
[186:08.54]Oh.
[186:12.09]So that's it, huh?
[186:13.79]You get like a celery stalk and some new costumes.
[186:26.30]Alright, well, I think that's all we're gonna see from the game.
[186:34.13]So, let me know.
[186:39.31]Unlock Space Michael.
[186:43.15]I'm not going to 100% that level.
[186:46.49]If 100% meant to just beat the level perfect, I would do them all.
[186:51.90]But the little hidden time thing and get a Wikipedia page out to press A at the exact moment, I'm going to fuck that up over and over again.
[187:05.48]There's also the first one.
[187:07.22]That one is just on Dreamcast.
[187:09.01]That's not ported anywhere.
[187:10.73]Maybe I'll just buy it.
[187:12.41]Because this one was a lot of fun.
[187:17.21]You know, why not just get the first one?
[187:20.59]I have a Dreamcast.
[187:22.01]We don't have to have a Dreamcast night, in quotes.
[187:24.57]We can just do it whenever.
[187:27.43]Because this is a great game.
[187:29.73]A lot of fun.
[187:34.35]Rhythm Heaven is another one, yeah?
[187:38.36]Alright.
[187:38.64]So where does that leave us?
[187:40.66]That leaves us with... I wanted to complete Space Channel 5.
[187:51.45]Go back to float.
[187:52.29]Oh, wait.
[187:52.89]Actually, I did.
[187:55.29]I was going through my disks.
[187:59.39]And there is one more Dreamcast game that was underneath hidden that we didn't do.
[188:05.47]And I brought my Dreamcast away from the desk.
[188:09.55]So I have to go, like, set it up to do it.
[188:11.47]And it's not gonna be worth doing.
[188:13.83]I can guarantee you this is absolutely not worth me setting the Dreamcast physically back up again.
[188:21.72]But it's right here.
[188:22.80]And it's gonna be such a waste of time.
[188:27.46]What is the game?
[188:29.26]Uh... It's not good.
[188:33.64]It's not gonna be fun.
[188:37.23]Do it.
[188:39.89]You know what?
[188:40.51]I bought it.
[188:41.03]It's here.
[188:42.13]We're capping off the Dreamcast.
[188:44.59]We are done with the Dreamcast, except for, in the future, um...
[188:51.39]Space Channel 5 I'm going to do just for fun.
[188:53.15]I'm going to play the whole game one night.
[188:55.27]And then Seaman.
[188:57.63]Maybe I'll do like a Seaman first and then Space Channel 5.
[189:00.85]Because all the Space Channel games are less than a few hours of game time.
[189:05.55]Unless you want to really 100% everything.
[189:08.74]So we'll do that at a later date.
[189:12.82]Let me go set... No Jet Set.
[189:14.68]I did Jet Set Radio.
[189:16.44]But I had a hard time with it.
[189:19.13]I couldn't really get into it.
[189:19.95]There's a pretty large learning curve that I couldn't really want.
[189:23.91]I didn't really want to dedicate time to it for some reason yesterday.
[189:29.28]But the game is... Alright, I'm going to tell you what it is, and you tell me if this is actually worth me going and getting the Dreamcast.
[189:39.50]We'll do that.
[189:40.44]How does that sound?
[189:42.30]The game is... I didn't even take it out of the plastic.
[189:54.55]There's a film of plastic on here.
[189:57.81]The game's called Stupid Invaders.
[190:13.80]Is it worth it?
[190:23.59]Well, never mind, guys.
[190:26.03]Never mind.
[190:36.03]Do I have to get scammed like fucking twice in a row?
[190:41.70]C-man didn't come for the microphone.
[190:44.18]And the only disk in here is disk two.
[191:01.69]Is that going to work?
[191:03.53]Is that actually... Is that going to open?
[191:05.93]Is there like a special edition that's disk one?
[191:07.87]Or did I just actually get like the Final Fantasy VII like 12 hours into the game disk?
[191:19.21]Alright, while I go get the Dreamcast, can you guys do me a favor and just type in Stupid Invaders disk one and figure that out?
[191:27.94]I'll be right back.
[191:30.89]Getting fucking scammed.
[194:23.11]Alright, so what's the verdict?
[194:26.03]Is this gonna work?
[194:28.27]Is it gonna open the game?
[194:39.37]Fucking believable.
[194:42.81]Yeah, I got one more game we could play.
[194:46.19]Well, no I don't.
[194:48.06]It's disk two.
[194:52.19]Just send him the microphone.
[194:54.36]Send him the microphone.
[194:56.06]Send him the no microphone.
[194:58.48]He doesn't need it.
[195:03.28]Disk one?
[195:03.86]We don't even have that.
[195:06.22]Just put disk two in there.
[195:07.32]Who cares?
[195:07.90]I'm just going to plug it in and see what happens.
[195:25.15]Put the disk in upside down.
[195:26.83]Let's see if we can post this thing.
[195:32.37]Alright, let's see.
[195:47.22]Good luck, everybody.
[195:48.78]I wonder what's going to happen here.
[196:03.48]find out I'm gonna change my mic okay looking forward to this one
[196:37.34]What's today's date?
[196:43.08]Who cares what today's date is?
[196:50.13]Here it comes.
[196:59.45]Let's hope it works.
[197:09.46]I can't see anything on the screen yet.
[197:12.91]Is there a voiceover?
[197:19.63]Hello?
[197:19.91]Is there anything on this disk?
[197:47.76]Nice space wallpaper, I agree.
[197:53.81]Okay.
[197:54.81]SEGA.
[197:56.93]MPEG softdeck.
[197:58.23]I don't think we got- we didn't get this.
[198:00.01]Save settings not found on VMU.
[198:01.59]Started- okay.
[198:13.64]Ubisoft made this?
[198:22.32]I bought this game.
[198:23.10]I paid for it.
[198:25.18]If it's just a special features DVD, we'll watch it.
[198:27.22]This is Stupid Invaders.
[198:50.65]this was a french kids TV show this wasn't really way to go candy so what do we do now steal a bicycle okay gentlemen please try to remain calm guys don't get excited it's not serious hide in this abandoned house while I repair the spaceship it'll only take a few minutes
[199:22.64]This actually is the game.
[199:25.10]A few years later...
[199:48.57]Can I make it louder?
[199:49.89]It's as loud as I can make it.
[199:51.67]I'm going to change the title here.
[199:54.56]Kids TV Show.
[199:58.48]Kids TV Show Dreamcast Shirts.
[200:00.72]I thought that was weird.
[200:27.69]This says minions.
[200:35.40]$300 million in small bills.
[200:52.96]The other half on the giveaway of those terrible little creatures.
[200:56.32]Why did I buy this?
[201:00.20]I don't know what I was thinking.
[201:04.18]But I want the spaceship too.
[201:11.63]Don't disappoint me, Pollack.
[201:13.65]Otherwise, it's you I cut in half.
[201:16.72]Like the $40 or $50 I spent on some of these bad old Dreamcast games.
[201:20.96]I could have gotten a couple.
[201:24.26]I could have gotten a couple.
[201:32.99]Stupid invaders.
[201:37.31]Do I actually get to play?
[201:39.54]I have a mouse.
[201:40.72]No, no, no, don't load game.
[201:43.34]No, I don't know.
[201:45.34]Is this a foot?
[201:54.03]Subtitles on.
[201:56.21]Stereo.
[202:00.89]Let's give it a go.
[202:39.80]Stupid Invaders, disk one, ISO.
[202:54.83]It's not illegal, I own it!
[202:57.45]I own it, it's on the screen.
[202:59.15]Is that illegal?
[202:59.95]I own the game.
[203:02.19]I was cheated out of owning the game that I paid for.
[203:04.95]I have it.
[203:06.79]It's right here.
[203:07.65]Whoa!
[203:16.33]What's going on with my camera?
[203:20.55]It was spinning too fast.
[203:24.67]Why are you doing this?
[203:25.81]Why does it save like the last fucking frame?
[203:29.39]Oh my god, get it out of here.
[203:33.96]I wanna show this to you.
[203:45.05]Look.
[203:46.92]right here in my hand.
[203:50.46]I own... That's right here.
[203:59.90]I own it.
[204:00.68]I paid for it.
[204:04.50]Now I'm out of sync.
[204:05.22]Well, we don't even need to be in sync.
[204:13.65]There, there.
[204:14.07]That's better.
[204:14.83]I own it.
[204:15.65]I don't...
[204:36.89]It's got a neck beard.
[204:38.27]Don't make fun of this until I shave it.
[204:40.12]This is how I feel right now.
[205:34.29]I'm just going to sit here like this.
[205:48.63]How do I duplicate this?
[206:06.14]Are there two here?
[206:06.82]Where is it?
[206:07.87]That just scared the fuck out of me.
[206:12.07]So, OBS, I don't know why you do this shit sometimes.
[206:16.45]I can't duplicate this.
[206:19.13]For no reason.
[208:09.25]Well, here's the thing, kids.
[208:14.49]When you buy used games, make sure, very, very important kids, always, under every circumstance, make sure that you get exactly what you paid for in that box.
[208:25.84]Because if it doesn't come in there, you end up in a scenario like this.
[208:31.43]Ooh, and he doesn't have the other disk.
[208:54.25]It's so fucking annoying.
[208:56.69]Because you just, you just expect somebody to just, did you just not know that it was the disk, that that was not the correct disk?
[209:08.58]Did you not put the Seaman microphone in there on purpose?
[209:12.64]Did you open the package and take the microphone out and then decide that, I don't understand.
[209:20.52]Send me the thing that I was supposed to have.
[209:30.37]Why would... What do you mean I didn't read?
[209:33.39]No, I'm going all out on this one.
[209:35.81]Because it's not even me saying it.
[209:37.89]It's fucking... Shplogo, whatever this dumbass's name is.
[209:41.30]What's going on?
[209:41.98]What's happening?
[209:45.04]Hold on, I'm going all out.
[210:01.69]I'm trying- I'm getting the voice changer.
[210:02.85]We're going all out for this one.
[210:07.46]Hang tight.
[210:43.43]Okay, so let's do this again.
[210:50.42]Am I synced up?
[210:52.92]Does this work?
[210:54.48]Can you see me?
[210:55.88]Can you see?
[210:58.73]Is there audio delay?
[211:01.89]Quiet.
[211:02.69]Well, I'll turn it up.
[211:03.27]Alright, anyway.
[211:05.29]So,
[211:15.82]Hello?
[211:22.44]Hello?
[211:23.62]That's horrible.
[211:27.08]Hello?
[211:28.32]No.
[211:30.00]Hello?
[211:31.26]Hello?
[211:33.62]Hello?
[211:34.98]Hello?
[211:36.37]Hello?
[211:37.35]Okay, this sounds pretty good.
[211:39.05]This is probably what this guy sounds like.
[211:46.50]Okay, so.
[211:49.32]Welcome to the stream, everybody, where we talk about very important topics.
[211:53.12]For instance, number one, when you buy something on Amazon, and it says, in package, inside of package, is going to be microphone and C-MIM.
[212:05.85]Maybe you might want to go on the computer and ask them to make sure that it's in there.
[212:10.57]Because this is on the second used game I purchased.
[212:18.02]that the shit on the description was not in the box.
[212:27.14]Okay.
[212:29.99]Anybody here like skittles?
[212:37.49]Stupid as fucking bullshit, I swear to God.
