[00:09.51]No, you see, I pocket medic you all the time.
[00:11.60]It's time for you to pocket medic me.
[00:14.42]Have you ever been pocket medic by like a god?
[00:22.64]Can't say that I have.
[00:23.61]So we're going up here?
[00:28.67]And then where to?
[00:31.51]Where to, master?
[00:33.29]No, you're the soldier.
[00:34.28]You're the leader.
[00:35.04]Alright, but that's not what you said last time.
[00:38.24]So I'm just gonna have you lead us to doors that don't open.
[00:40.22]Oh my god.
[00:43.42]I was gonna say something before you got there too, but I just wanted to make sure you're like, don't know what you're doing.
[00:48.11]Hold on, hold on.
[00:48.51]We have to go up here.
[00:49.67]Come on up here.
[00:52.55]Don't pop it, don't pop it.
[00:54.58]Don't pop it.
[00:56.65]Hold on to it.
[00:57.99]Don't pop it.
[00:58.87]There's not only is there going to need to be a scenario where there's a lot of people, but I'm also going to have to believe you can kill them, which might not happen.
[01:05.09]Don't pop it.
[01:07.83]I'm not.
[01:08.34]Kill the sniper before he shoots me in the head.
[01:10.18]He's not gonna.
[01:10.98]I got him.
[01:12.16]Don't pop it.
[01:12.64]Alright, what I need you to do here is I need you to pop it.
[01:19.47]There it is.
[01:21.45]Oh, I got him.
[01:22.08]Don't worry.
[01:23.42]I'll take care of my medic friend.
[01:25.20]Oh, yeah.
[01:26.66]Oh, damn.
[01:27.24]What's that?
[01:27.82]More crits.
[01:30.44]Ah, look out for the sticky.
[01:37.55]I'm trying to, like, help you.
[01:38.59]Nice shot.
[01:40.41]Wow, good miss.
[01:41.53]Alright, pop it.
[01:47.24]Pop it!
[01:49.06]Come on!
[01:55.10]You didn't even see him!
[01:57.42]I was waiting for him to backstab you and you accidentally kill a dude.
[02:04.80]I can't believe I accidentally just killed that guy.
[02:07.54]He's up top.
[02:13.20]Come over here.
[02:14.62]I don't want you to die.
[02:16.67]You think I'm gonna die?
[02:17.65]That's cute!
[02:19.87]Alright, we ready?
[02:22.47]Oh shit!
[02:25.13]I like that first rocket straight into the ground.
[02:28.03]What about that rocket?
[02:28.77]You like that one?
[02:30.49]Alright, now we do this.
[02:36.26]Come here, cupcake!
[02:38.92]No one ever goes out of that door, you know.
[02:41.66]What happened?
[02:42.18]Look at the kill feed.
[02:43.80]Yeah.
[02:44.58]Did you kill what?
[02:45.85]What happened?
[02:46.37]Who killed me?
[02:50.15]Yeah, nice fucking messy here, by the way.
[02:52.31]Get a fucking comb.
[02:54.22]Would you comb me here with a... Would you comb me here with a Snickers bar today, Medic?
[02:57.88]Fine, I'm going back to spawn and change.
[02:59.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:00.00]Come back, come back, come back, come back.
[03:01.10]I'm sorry.
[03:01.60]That was mean.
[03:02.04]No, changing it.
[03:03.28]No, don't.
[03:04.62]It looks nice.
[03:05.90]Doesn't look all messy.
[03:06.74]It looks fine.
[03:10.00]Oh, he died.
[03:12.60]So this is just aim indoor and fire crit rockets indoor, right?
[03:15.78]Stand in front of the door.
[03:17.62]Alright, here comes a guy.
[03:18.50]Use it.
[03:18.76]Kill him.
[03:19.28]No.
[03:21.58]Just kill him.
[03:23.50]Now stand in front of the door, face to the door.
[03:25.70]Not him.
[03:28.31]Wait, don't shoot.
[03:31.31]Next time it opens.
[03:32.97]No, they're gonna open again.
[03:41.57]This just sucked.
[03:43.34]Let's go build it again.
[03:44.42]Let's go.
[03:47.40]Don't kill him.
[03:47.88]Don't.
[03:48.40]What do you mean, don't kill him?
[03:50.94]I mean, because I can Ubersaw and I would have got it.
[03:53.21]I'm going to die.
[03:54.61]Are you going to die?
[03:56.11]No, boy.
[03:56.69]They know.
[03:57.03]They know.
[03:57.33]They know.
[03:58.21]They're pushing down here now.
[04:01.70]Run.
[04:03.22]Run.
[04:07.61]You have to commit to the joke, Star.
[04:08.93]Don't you know how that works?
[04:10.35]No.
[04:10.65]Bill Dooper.
[04:12.67]Do you have a shotgun?
[04:14.17]Yes.
[04:15.27]How come you never use it?
[04:16.51]I do.
[04:16.75]What are you talking about?
[04:17.91]I've never seen you use it.
[04:19.55]Oh yeah, you killed that spy, but that was like a joke, too.
[04:22.77]No.
[04:22.99]Alright, we're gonna stay in here.
[04:24.49]Wait, they're right there.
[04:25.65]Nobody ever comes through here, though.
[04:27.29]Oh my god, you're such an idiot.
[04:29.59]That's what I was warning you about.
[04:30.85]Well, you were looking down that hallway!
[04:34.32]So what's your favorite movie?
[04:36.32]What would you say?
[04:36.82]Favorite movie?
[04:38.36]I saw Amelie recently.
[04:39.54]It was really good.
[04:40.53]But my favorite movie is probably Coraline.
[04:42.41]Have you ever seen The Life of Pi?
[04:45.61]Isn't it P?
[04:47.03]No, it's Pi.
[04:48.03]It's pretty good.
[04:49.15]You'd probably like it.
[04:50.47]It's an interesting story.
[04:52.11]Okay, wait.
[04:53.79]After they cap it.
[04:56.51]See, no.
[04:57.01]They got denied.
[04:58.54]Okay, you know what?
[04:59.80]Yeah, after they cap it.
[05:01.02]Because then they'll all sort of group up there and start pushing it.
[05:03.34]That's sort of what happens.
[05:04.64]Yeah.
[05:15.47]He did not want that.
[05:17.73]Oh, that was great.
[05:21.59]Can they please push the fucking cart?
[05:26.37]Did you just say, did the tiger fart?
[05:28.60]Yeah, I don't know.
[05:29.16]Like, if there's a part in the movie where, like, it's a serious movie the whole way, and then they're on the boat and the tiger just... And, like, Peapie looks over at him and is just like, You really gonna do that?
[05:40.33]You really gonna fight on my boat?
[05:41.57]You ever think they're gonna fight on the boat?
[05:43.15]Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Burgah Boy fought on the boat?
[05:45.43]I'm just taking a peek.
[05:45.97]That would be funny.
[05:46.83]No, if you take one peek, I would have laughed my ass off if you got headshot or something, just for no reason.
[05:52.40]You turn the corner and immediately get dropped.
[05:54.42]Are you trying to tell me that that medic that came in here didn't go tell all his friends that we were in here?
[05:58.41]This guy, he's like the only guy.
[06:00.21]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[06:02.19]I got him, I got him.
[06:03.41]I just freaked out and killed that guy.
[06:06.07]Is he?
[06:06.23]There's a medic with Uber around this corner.
[06:07.81]No, he's dead.
[06:09.13]I freaked out, dude.
[06:10.51]That was a total freak out.
[06:11.31]Dude, this guy is giving us away.
[06:12.43]Get the hell out of here, guy.
[06:13.35]You're giving us away.
[06:14.83]Fine, I'll high five you.
[06:15.69]I didn't even work.
[06:16.15]You didn't even do it right.
[06:17.30]I didn't even work.
[06:18.70]I can't even high five him.
[06:20.02]He's stuck on like the hill.
[06:22.56]We agreed.
[06:23.38]We're waiting until they get the cop part.
[06:26.32]And we're going with this critz.
[06:27.94]Because we're corner creeps.
[06:29.68]You know how to corner creep?
[06:31.08]You ever corner creep before in your life?
[06:33.66]I got arrested.
[06:38.68]Okay, this is really boring.
[06:40.48]No, no, I'm committed to this now.
[06:41.89]If you go out here, I'm going to be pissed off.
[06:43.97]I'm not going to leave.
[06:44.77]When you go to do something, you do it to completion.
[06:47.29]Now I'm like hiding.
[06:48.29]I'm like crouching.
[06:49.11]You're looking around.
[06:49.69]I'm twitching.
[06:52.73]And there's this one same person.
[06:55.72]Here comes the pyro.
[06:57.08]Well, he's dead.
[06:58.97]If you die to him, I will... I'm not going to die to him.
[07:01.29]...never forgive you.
[07:02.77]You want to just... Let's just freak somebody out.
[07:04.69]When their spawn door opens, we just pop.
[07:06.65]How about that?
[07:07.53]Okay.
[07:11.12]You're so bad.
[07:12.46]Behind you.
[07:13.04]I'm going to die.
[07:14.00]Like, that's not behind you.
[07:16.52]Oh my god.
[07:18.69]Did you not get a kill?
