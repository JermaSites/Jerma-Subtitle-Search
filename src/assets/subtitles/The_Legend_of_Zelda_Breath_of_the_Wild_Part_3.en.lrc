[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.21]I am back.
[00:09.05]Decided to take the opportunity to make another tea.
[00:15.90]Refill the beverage a little bit here.
[00:19.62]And now... We're going to play Breath of the Wild.
[00:25.94]It looks like the switch... I don't think the switch even turned off.
[00:34.46]If I'm completely honest.
[00:40.24]Let me see here.
[00:47.09]Yeah, I don't think the switch even turned off.
[00:51.37]This is the exact screen that I was on, right?
[00:55.21]Did I just go to sleep or something?
[00:56.17]I don't know.
[00:56.59]That's weird.
[01:00.82]Alright, bear with me for a second because I have to do some audio changes here.
[01:06.96]I have to delay my voice and the camera.
[01:15.03]One second.
[01:19.31]Like this.
[01:22.69]Hello, hello, hello!
[01:23.43]Okay.
[01:32.75]Okay.
[01:34.25]That should do it.
[01:42.52]Now, should I delay?
[01:43.96]I got to delay the switch audio by a little bit, right?
[01:47.92]We'll do a test.
[01:51.07]It's not working.
[01:52.63]It's not ready yet.

[02:28.48]Why didn't they stay?
[02:31.73]Why didn't they fucking stay?
[02:33.55]They should have stayed.
[02:42.99]Whatever.
[02:46.47]Okay.
[02:50.64]Headphones are in.
[02:57.02]I believe I am ready to play Breath of the Wild.
[03:03.43]Change the input on my screen.
[03:07.11]Alright, let's go.
[03:11.95]Let's do a test here really quickly.
[03:15.11]If I go like this, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five.
[03:22.02]We good?
[03:28.69]Seems pretty good.
[03:29.17]Alright.
[03:31.95]I'm going to turn this up a little for you guys.
[03:34.21]Because it's a little low for me.
[03:37.37]Hold on.
[03:40.57]How do I do that from here?
[03:44.46]There we go.
[03:44.80]Okay.
[03:44.90]Alright.
[03:48.52]I'm ready.
[03:48.92]So what was the last thing I did?
[03:53.92]Is it too loud?
[03:54.44]Is it just right?
[03:56.56]I had a bunch of shit marked.
[04:03.76]Oh, right.
[04:04.06]We can do this thing.
[04:09.09]Audio's good.
[04:09.71]Is it fine?
[04:10.67]Okay.
[04:12.81]Oh, the face cam has to move too, yo.
[04:14.57]That's right.
[04:19.59]How's this in a good spot?
[04:24.03]Turn this down.
[04:24.53]I feel like this is, like, bright as hell.
[04:26.27]Why is it so bright?
[04:30.74]It's too bright.
[04:35.06]How come you look like the Hulk?
[04:37.09]That's actually kind of a compliment.
[04:42.25]Alright, let's go.
[04:43.33]So, I was- I wanted to kill one of the Guardians.
[04:45.87]Wherever that is.
[04:47.61]But maybe I'll do the, uh, the- the Zora thing?
[05:00.76]Oh, that's right.
[05:01.22]I never- I'm never around the horse.
[05:02.82]I never- The horse is never available.
[05:15.25]Zora quest is related?
[05:16.81]Okay.
[05:18.49]So let me fast travel over here then.
[05:22.29]Yeah.
[05:31.70]Look at the motorcycle.
[05:37.62]There's an instant horse TP item near the second stable.
[05:43.64]Maybe one day I'll get it.
[05:48.55]Chat, shut up.
[05:50.31]Wait, I... Oh, oops.
[05:54.23]Chat, shut up.
[05:54.97]Don't tell him that.
[05:59.11]Well, sorry.
[05:59.97]I got that info now, don't I?
[06:08.53]This is not Shadow of Mordor.
[06:11.67]Which, by the way, what a great game.
[06:15.11]I was about to just jump off.
[06:17.79]And I thought for some reason it was going to be like... No, that's not how it works.
[06:29.66]Monolith is making a Wonder Woman game, right?
[06:34.36]I can't wait for a new Monolith game.
[06:37.34]That's going to be so good.
[06:41.44]Okay, so how do I get down from here without... Oh, wait!
[06:43.42]I have the glider!
[06:44.28]It's been like a week.
[06:45.08]What am I talking about?
[06:45.74]Did you say, who cares?
[06:58.19]I mean, it's... Monolith made the two Shadow of War and Shadow of Mordor.
[07:04.41]That'll be their first game since Shadow of War.
[07:15.98]Alright, let's move.
[07:16.80]What do I have for weapons equipped right now?
[07:18.14]Look at all this cool shit I have.
[07:19.08]I don't know when to use it.
[07:30.69]Did you like Shadow of War?
[07:31.73]I streamed Shadow of War for like three or four hours.
[07:36.03]I think I streamed it one day.
[07:39.27]I honestly don't think it was more than four hours.
[07:54.50]This is odd.
[07:56.06]That was very odd.
[07:57.38]I dropped it?
[08:05.00]How do I throw this?
[08:20.83]What the fuck just happened?
[08:22.43]How do I throw?
[08:23.83]I... Ugh.
[08:31.10]Alright.
[08:31.46]I gotta get back into this.
[08:33.16]It's like all the buttons are different.
[08:44.05]Yeah, that's right.
[08:44.79]The throw button.
[08:45.45]Okay.
[08:47.75]All the buttons are different.
[09:13.32]Oh my god, there's so many of them.
[09:14.90]Alright, I gotta- I can't- I can't just sit on these forever.
[09:19.66]I have to use these now.
[09:21.82]Can I use the spear?
[09:48.79]Jesus.
[09:54.89]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[09:57.00]Alright, that's two down.
[10:06.24]You idiot.
[10:11.39]I want a bow.
[10:17.57]Do I have any arrows?
[10:20.11]How do I not have any arrows?
[10:33.68]Oh my god, the frame rate.
[10:35.02]Alright, that's good.
[10:45.83]Only one more.
[10:46.31]I'm good.
[10:46.65]We got it.
[10:48.87]That's a good bow.
[10:54.94]Are they protecting a unlocking chest or something?
[10:57.90]I don't see anything.
[10:59.40]I saw one earlier.
[11:01.22]Oh, you cannot point blank me, right?
[11:17.69]It's broken?
[11:18.27]Fuck.
[11:21.77]This shit's broken.
[11:22.59]I don't want to use these weapons.
[11:26.30]I need something else.
[11:28.24]Did they drop anything else?
[11:36.36]Shock arrow.
[11:36.98]Okay, well that's better.
[11:41.02]What the fuck is going on?
[11:58.03]This happened before and I don't know what it did.
[12:07.79]What does this do?
[12:08.27]Does this respawn every enemy?
[12:20.68]It respawns every single one.
[12:21.86]I just went through all this bullshit.
[12:23.88]And I have to do this again?
[12:30.53]Oh, come on.
[12:31.11]Alright, I'm getting the hell out of here.
[12:40.74]I'm just kidding.
[12:41.60]There was a chest here, but I don't even want it anymore.
[12:44.66]I don't want this.
[12:45.46]Alright, we're good.
[12:58.59]There's like a warthog or something there, but I don't care.
[13:04.47]Okay.
[13:05.79]Head over here.
[13:11.83]He's learning?
[13:12.45]Wrong way?
[13:12.93]What do you mean?
[13:15.13]I'm trying to go here.
[13:15.75]Oh, this turned out to be actually the wrong way.
[13:30.16]You're right.
[13:32.32]Don't fall off and die in the waterfall, please.
[13:38.47]Is there any way to... I can get up there.
[13:42.01]It's raining, but it's okay.
[13:46.63]Let me try getting up there.
[13:55.66]I think there's enough places for me to stop.
[14:00.40]Yeah, I should be fine.
[14:03.87]Move this microphone a little bit closer to my mouth.
[14:08.60]I think I'm alright.
[14:16.21]Impatient.
[14:17.67]You dope.
[14:30.71]Wait, the Blood Moon is sort of a memory clear for the Switch.
[14:33.99]It basically resets all enemies and areas that you've affected in gameplay, so the Switch doesn't have to keep storing that info in RAM.
[14:41.19]Really?
[14:45.45]That's kind of... Wow, okay.
[14:54.23]I can't climb this because it just rains here permanently.
[14:57.01]There's got to be a place I can get up here.
[15:03.74]Even just to jump up there and then stop.
[15:06.04]I'll try it.
[15:06.46]I'll try it once.
[15:07.48]This is impossible.
[15:20.49]I'm just gonna go the other way.
[15:24.49]I'm just gonna go around the whole thing.
[15:29.69]Alright, fine.
[15:32.13]I thought I could just be a skip Andy and just jump over that and climb it and jump over.
[15:35.66]Okay.
[15:49.41]You missed.
[16:00.64]No, this is plus plus.
[16:01.70]We just want regular.
[16:02.64]Okay, this one's just regular.
[16:13.69]No skipping.
[16:16.29]One of those little dudes.
[16:20.95]The frog got away too.
[16:22.43]Come on.
[16:27.23]Radish.
[16:33.78]Where does this person even come from?
[16:34.80]Fuck.
[16:41.59]Okay.
[16:49.05]This is defense boost.
[16:50.15]I think I'm just going to eat this.
[16:51.37]Or maybe it's just the steak.
[16:52.33]I'll be alright.
[16:57.08]Radishes are really... This is great.
[16:59.94]These are awesome.
[17:02.69]You did a circle?
[17:03.34]I know, but I know, but I'm just trying to skip.
[17:07.58]I was trying to skip.
[17:08.46]Okay.
[17:18.89]Just stay on the road.
[17:20.35]I was trying to skip.
[17:27.99]Don't eat those radishes.
[17:29.53]Don't eat them?
[17:30.00]Why not?
[17:32.73]I'm a raw radish guy.
[17:33.93]I don't want cooked radishes.
[17:35.85]I want them raw.
[17:37.59]I want them rinsed.
[17:38.83]Then I want to just cut the ends off and I want to put the whole, just crunch the whole thing.
[17:41.97]Okay, now I can skip.
[18:03.05]Like a moron.
[18:04.73]What's wrong with raw radishes?
[18:06.76]Okay, a raw radish is my favorite vegetable without a doubt.
[18:13.78]Anybody under here?
[18:14.28]No.
[18:14.34]They are good.
[18:23.01]They are.
[18:28.56]They're amazing.
[18:29.72]You're a freak.
[18:30.50]I don't... I don't know.
[18:31.46]I think that raw radishes are the best.
[18:32.96]You can call me weirdo if you want.
[18:37.82]What about pickled radishes?
[18:38.82]Those are S tier.
[18:39.40]I think anything radishes is S tier.
[18:40.64]That's a pretty bush.
[18:47.49]Alright, what's in the way here?
[18:48.33]Is it gonna fall?
[18:55.63]Alright, so now... Just gonna stay on the road.
[19:00.68]No, I don't wanna watch the... I don't wanna watch the hero playthrough.
[19:02.88]We'll watch that later.
[19:18.45]Who's this?
[19:21.53]What the fuck?! !
[19:37.79]Mrs. Boomerang!
[19:38.67]I just... I'm standing... Get out of the water.
[19:50.94]Get out of the water.
[19:51.62]Out of the water!
[19:52.08]Out of the water!
[19:52.52]Out of the water!
[19:52.90]Out of the water!
[19:53.36]Stop sliding down the mountain!
[19:54.86]Oh my god.
[20:00.96]What just fucking hit me?
[20:07.91]I dropped something.
[20:08.60]What was it?
[20:09.44]Should I drop a shield?
[20:16.88]I severely overestimated how far I had to shoot that.
[20:19.94]These guys suck!
[20:36.68]Alright, hold on.
[21:05.97]Ooh, that's a good boomerang.
[21:12.29]Alright, where's my bow?
[21:18.06]Well, I was gonna say, where's the ding?
[21:32.03]Alright, give me all this shit back.
[21:35.20]Alright, do not stand in water.
[21:36.46]24?
[21:36.48]Okay, that's actually really good.
[21:54.07]Don't throw this.
[22:00.21]Okay, we're good.
[22:12.37]floaty dusty thing over here.
[22:18.39]Alright.
[22:22.00]Hold on.
[22:22.82]Ooh.
[22:24.82]Nice.
[22:27.22]The shield?
[22:27.68]The shield is great.
[22:28.30]This thing's got like 28 or something, right?
[22:31.84]Okay, I gotta go that way.
[22:32.70]Uh, I'm imagining I probably have to cross the bridge.
[22:36.88]Right?
[22:40.78]So no skip Andy here.
[22:48.53]Tom Scott.
[22:49.69]This water is electrified.
[22:51.63]It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.
[22:59.75]Good callback from a few hours ago.
[23:16.36]Alright, I'm across a bridge.
[23:20.98]I'm physically incapable of backseating.
[23:23.61]Oh, look!
[23:27.87]Look below!
[23:28.37]Look down here!
[23:28.91]It's everybody's favorite character.
[23:38.61]You're pretty far off.
[23:40.40]I was sure you'd be passing over this bridge, so I've been waiting for you.
[23:44.41]You will be in Zora's domain before you know it.
[23:46.42]In fact, I'm going to head that way too.
[23:48.30]I'll meet you there.
[23:51.18]Whoa, Link.
[23:52.30]Beware, warrior.
[23:53.44]A monster approaches from behind you.
[24:00.28]Wait, we're doing this?
[24:01.10]Okay.
[24:29.36]Annihilated.
[24:30.02]I haven't seen a shrine pop up.
[24:36.88]Like my favorite part of the whole game.
[24:47.18]Staying on the road.
[24:54.05]There isn't one here?
[24:55.29]Aww.
[24:56.49]That's alright.
[25:05.33]I have to cook some food.
[25:06.93]All I have is food that doesn't heal me.
[25:08.43]It just gives me 10 minutes of, like, pausing around.
[25:11.67]Ooh, nice.
[25:22.11]What was that?
[25:30.76]Was it just a deer?
[25:43.72]I mean, I got...
[26:32.86]Hyrule herb.
[26:33.70]This healthy herb grows abundantly in the plains of Hyrule.
[26:36.09]Cook it.
[26:42.91]So where's the first guardian?
[26:43.93]First guardian was up here, right?
[26:50.43]This kind of general area.
[26:52.49]I'll do that after.
[27:16.83]Do I have a health potion or something?
[27:25.65]Drink the milk.
[27:27.19]Eat the raw meat.
[27:27.97]I think I'll just eat one of these.
[27:28.89]I mean, I cooked them for this very purpose.
[27:34.47]Mid-level resistance to electricity.
[27:36.00]Alright, I'm gonna drink that.
[27:38.54]And then I'm gonna eat something that has... I mean, I cooked it for a reason.
[27:47.42]I'm gonna eat it.
[27:48.48]I cooked it for a reason.
[28:05.67]Oh, I'll take the lightning rod.
[28:06.77]That sounds fucking awesome.
[28:17.45]Ooh, alright.
[28:18.25]This is fun.
[28:21.06]Cool.
[28:23.12]Alright, I want to use... I gotta keep going.
[28:30.89]I gotta utilize this.
[28:43.76]I gotta take the- What- God- Look at this fucking road!
[28:55.55]You just use the direct path.
[28:56.75]I don't like direct paths.
[28:57.83]I just- I wanna be able to climb a wall and jump over.
[29:11.47]I like to climb over a wall, jump and fall, and take 80% of my HP and skip five minutes of walking.
[29:21.18]I'm like that in every game.
[29:30.99]Did I miss something?
[29:36.31]What did I miss?
[29:46.43]I don't see anything.
[29:46.93]Big shiny wall.
[29:50.41]I looked at the first one.
[29:51.49]I didn't think anything was significant with it.
[29:53.77]I thought I could climb it.
[29:56.11]Did I look at it?
[30:04.74]Didn't I look at the other one?
[30:05.54]Okay.
[30:14.04]Okay.
[30:17.41]I didn't want to click it again.
[30:18.15]I just, whatever.
[30:18.85]Alright.
[30:19.81]So a hundred years ago, King Dorthan ascended to the throne.
[30:22.97]A stray guardian crossed upland Zorana into our domain.
[30:25.98]The guardian seemed unstoppable.
[30:28.94]It was then that our King Dora Fan, without a thought for his own safety, came out to face the Guardian himself.
[30:34.68]With supernatural strength, he lifted the Guardian and hurled it into a ravine.
[30:39.06]The impact of the fall left the Guardian in pieces and was never to trouble another Zora ever again.
[30:44.08]The citizens celebrated the King's valor from then on.
[30:46.02]Their trust and respect for him grew beyond compare.
[30:49.05]You can still see the scar he earned that day on his forehead, a token of his triumph.
[30:53.05]What are you reading?
[31:01.33]There's a lot of people here.
[31:02.77]Right?
[31:02.93]There's a lot of people there.
[31:03.67]I'll read the lore for the people that are here.
[31:09.85]Harry Potter?
[31:10.81]No.
[31:20.04]You skipped all that boring shit.
[31:23.18]I'm gonna just tell you right now.
[31:25.99]Um...
[31:29.24]Be careful saying boring and Zelda in the same sentence.
[31:36.92]I don't... I don't think I would do that.
[31:42.61]Headshot.
[31:44.79]Headshot.
[31:56.08]Well, I mean, it's just not true.
[31:57.20]Okay.
[31:57.38]Okay.
[32:00.15]Cricket?
[32:04.03]I don't play Zelda games.
[32:05.71]This is the first Zelda game I played in almost two decades.
[32:10.91]I think this is really fun.
[32:14.65]Alright, what do I have for weapons?
[32:17.86]Gee, what do I need?
[32:18.52]Okay, I've got... What's this crap?
[32:22.24]Yeah, drop this.
[32:24.14]There we go, that's better.
[32:29.94]Alright, can I do this?
[32:31.79]Yeah, I can.
[32:47.28]Shrine?
[32:47.62]I thought you guys said there wasn't a shrine here.
[32:56.34]To be fair, text-based lore in most games is boring.
[32:59.57]Put it in dialogue or something.
[33:01.79]Text-based lore is interesting for... extra.
[33:06.87]Right?
[33:07.83]It's cool to be like, oh, you know, I could read this if I wanted to.
[33:11.17]I'll read it if I feel like it.
[33:14.45]I never... I genuinely never read text-based lore.
[33:19.26]I just kind of don't.
[33:20.74]It's not that I don't appreciate it, it's just that my brain just wants to move.
[33:36.51]Been waiting for you, Link.
[33:40.54]Welcome.
[33:40.90]Behold the pride of my people, Zora's domain.
[33:42.74]Now I shall introduce you to the king.
[33:45.02]Hurry this way.
[33:56.05]I tried to not have the cam come on before I, like, the hard blink.
[33:59.73]But I caught it because the cam is delayed by, like, a thousand milliseconds.
[34:04.03]So I caught it at the wrong time.
[34:05.69]So you saw it.
[34:10.29]The shrine's right in front of me.
[34:18.65]I don't care about anything else but this.
[34:38.26]He loves shrines.
[34:39.38]I really do.
[34:39.94]I like the shrines because they're these complete, just total episodes of content.
[34:47.60]Just go in, do the task.
[34:49.49]It's a small area and then leave.
[34:54.59]I like it.
[35:02.10]Interesting.
[35:07.61]Pushing power.
[35:13.29]What's the goal?
[35:24.35]I can walk up here, OK?
[35:28.36]What am I trying to do?
[35:55.80]or a spear this is how much damage this thing do oh my god get rid of this okay alright push push stuff the goal is to get the balls I don't know
[36:20.35]I'm going to check this place out first there.
[36:22.03]OK, so I gotta get that ball.
[36:24.53]Into link you can definitely climb that.
[36:31.46]There is like there is no way you can't get up there.
[37:38.01]How do I turn this on?
[37:46.50]Oh, I have to get one of these.
[37:47.90]Okay.
[37:48.38]Alright.
[37:48.74]Alright.
[37:49.62]I get it.
[37:50.00]For some reason, I thought I had to get that one in there and not any of these ones.
[38:41.11]Yeah.
[39:11.69]Give me that give me that give me it give me that give me that give me that fucking thing What the fuck are you doing?
[39:33.35]Why does this hurt?
[39:50.10]Does it have to come to a complete stop?
[40:04.39]It has to come to a complete stop before I don't get hurt.
[40:10.08]I mean, this is going to work.
[40:11.82]It's going to go in there and it's going to work.
[40:41.11]I could have just done this.
[40:42.05]Why did it explode?
[41:10.27]Why did it explode?
[42:16.68]No, no, no, I know, but hold on.
[42:21.59]No, you fucking idiot!
[42:22.63]Get out of the way!
[42:31.52]There it is.
[42:31.88]I'm just trying to... whatever.
[42:45.63]I'm doing this the wrong way, but... Okay, I don't care if you backseat, but confirm I have to get one of those balls in there to drop the other ball.
[42:53.69]Or is it just get the ball at the top that's orange in there?
[43:02.49]The ball at the top in orange is the only one that's supposed to go in there.
[43:06.11]Is that correct?
[43:06.69]Or do I have to get one in there to make the ball drop?
[43:08.39]I don't know what you're saying yes to.
[43:28.53]I got it.
[43:50.78]Okay, so you have to get this out of here.
[44:17.56]Okay.
[44:18.94]Now do not free chat.
[44:19.96]Keep him locked in here.
[44:31.45]Thank you.
[44:31.89]Alright, get the fuck out of there.
[44:39.04]I definitely have to block this with ice.
[44:41.04]That's very clear.
[44:44.20]That's blocked.
[44:49.40]How do I move that?
[44:52.48]You know, what would have been a smart idea was to just walk up here.
[45:00.43]I didn't even check to see if I could even go up here.
[45:04.43]I should have just walked up here.
[45:06.89]I looked up and I was like, oh yeah, I don't know about that.
[45:10.67]I think I have to do.
[45:11.53]What am I doing?
[45:12.07]Just go walk up and look.
[45:16.80]Okay.
[45:18.24]How do I actually move this though?
[45:19.41]Should I do it with like an arrow?
[46:07.65]Move the fucking thing.
[46:10.39]What the fuck can I move this for?
[46:29.01]Link, stop getting glued to every object that's around you.
[46:33.01]Okay, so...
[46:41.97]I thought that was just like a nice like spa entrance.
[46:45.21]I didn't know that I could, whatever.
[47:18.79]Oh shit!
[47:23.24]Oh shit!
[47:24.06]Oh shit!
[47:25.12]Oh shit, I'm fine.
[47:48.83]What the fuck?
[48:38.83]No, no, no.
[48:39.45]This way, this way, this way.
[48:40.25]Okay, that should be fine, right?
[48:53.95]Oh, shut up.
[50:03.27]Alright.
[50:09.92]So, the issue here is I did it too hard, but should I just get it to drop here instead?
[50:19.34]I have to move it over this way.
[50:24.38]Okay, that's what I'm doing.
[50:26.13]That's the plan.
[50:28.79]I'm making it go that way.
[50:59.06]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:00.34]If I wanted to go that way, how... I gotta block this.
[51:08.45]Block this shit right now.
[51:13.69]Now it's not gonna go...
[51:32.05]Alright, that's it.
[51:35.11]It's gonna end up down here.
[51:38.34]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[51:39.52]Get out of here!
[51:40.69]You're gonna mess up everything.
[51:41.43]Get out of here.
[53:16.82]Alright, let him out.
[53:26.71]What did this person say?
[53:30.97]That shrine took me three times as long as it should have.
[53:36.17]That was painful.
[53:41.70]took an ungodly amount of time alright what's the score ign you don't know what you're talking about you don't know what you're talking about
[54:14.24]Alright, that was fun.
[54:22.91]You're a... You're a Germaniac today.
[54:27.57]So this is... Okay, so now we're here.
[54:28.73]So we're in the Zora domain.
[54:32.05]Very cool.
[54:38.54]Yeah, some puzzles are harder than others for people.
[54:40.30]Some... Look, maybe I'm better at the combat stuff than you.
[54:44.74]Maybe I'm better at some of the other puzzles than you.
[54:47.02]Maybe you're better than me at some of the other puzzles.
[54:53.37]But you aren't, though.
[54:53.95]Maybe that's you saying that.
[55:05.51]I literally did this a week or two ago during the 14-hour stream.
[55:12.88]That's what I did at that 10-hour mark.
[55:16.24]I did that, remember?
[55:17.20]That's what I did.
[55:21.55]You don't have any fins.
[55:22.85]Are you Hylian?
[55:24.83]I'm the president of Prince Sidon's fan club.
[55:31.00]My name is Tula.
[55:32.80]Do you know Prince Sidon?
[55:36.54]Nah.
[55:38.19]Oh, I see.
[55:39.29]Ah, Prince Sidon.
[55:40.79]Just thinking of you turns me to mush.
[55:43.54]On the other hand, if that pack of geezers shows up again, I swear.
[55:47.62]Oh, I'm sorry.
[55:49.48]Anyway, Prince Sidon is a man with magnificent ideas.
[55:52.96]Oh, I know.
[55:53.22]Why don't you go and have a chat with Prince Sidon?
[55:54.89]Yes, do.
[56:23.22]I just lapped you three times.
[56:24.30]Oh, stuff!
[56:31.06]Is this a pool?
[56:36.51]You're sleeping in the pool.
[56:38.69]That's bad, isn't it?
[56:41.45]Oh, wait.
[56:42.01]They have gills.
[56:43.61]Okay, never mind.
[56:53.99]They're fish.
[56:54.87]Yeah, I know.
[56:55.39]I just was... I don't know.
[56:57.25]I saw the Zs.
[56:57.93]What are you, up top?
[57:10.63]Singing?
[57:16.98]That verse is freaking me out.
[57:38.60]Ah, you must be the Hylian that Sidon brought here, correct?
[57:44.60]You did well to come all the way here.
[57:47.50]I am King Dora Fan, ruler of the Zora.
[57:51.28]Hmm, that object upon your waist, is that not a Sheikah Slate?
[57:55.68]Hmm.
[57:56.88]Now that I've gotten a good look at you, it's too clear who you are.
[58:01.68]You are the Hylian champion, Link.
[58:04.54]Do not tell me you've forgotten me.
[58:07.89]The Hylian Champion?
[58:09.29]You can't mean THE Link?
[58:11.15]That champion?
[58:12.68]So that's where I've heard your name before.
[58:14.68]What a fateful coincidence that we should cross paths.
[58:18.20]I cannot believe it.
[58:19.00]The Hylian Champion, Link, has appeared before us.
[58:22.08]We have met numerous times, I'll have you know.
[58:24.98]Ah, so many memories.
[58:26.54]My mind is overflowing with nostalgia, my friend.
[58:30.25]I had heard a terrible rumor that you had fallen in combat.
[58:33.61]But it appears you managed to survive extraordinarily.
[58:38.14]I've been sleeping.
[58:40.42]Oh.
[58:42.68]Come again?
[58:43.52]Sleeping, you say?
[58:44.72]Is that why you do not seem to remember me?
[58:49.40]Surely you must remember my precious daughter, Mipha, yes.
[58:52.48]You do, do you not?
[58:55.93]Mipha who?
[58:59.52]Father, I do not believe discussing my sister is helping matters at the moment.
[59:04.46]Links is confused.
[59:30.20]Oh.
[59:30.90]Yes, of course.
[59:32.54]But first, is it worth noting how remarkable is that sea... I can't... I can never say your name right.
[59:39.41]Sidon.
[59:40.13]Brodage.
[59:43.13]That's quite a feat, my boy.
[59:46.37]That's a good one.
[59:48.49]Link, I doubt not that you have endured a great many trials.
[59:51.37]Still, I must ask you to hear my plea.
[59:54.57]Now then, hero, I must inform you that Zora's domain is in danger of vanishing because of divine beast Faruta.
[60:00.54]I shall do you the courtesy of speaking bluntly.
[60:03.35]We are alone.
[60:03.95]And we can't stop it alone.
[60:08.45]Will you lend us your strength?
[60:11.23]What?
[60:13.87]King Dorvan!
[60:14.87]My liege!
[60:15.61]Please do not speak so!
[60:17.67]To ask a Hylian for help?
[60:19.33]Why, the very thought of it curls my fins!
[60:22.50]Muzu, I expected more of you.
[60:24.42]How can you still protest?
[60:27.34]Muzu, it's rude to speak that way to your king and his guest.
[60:30.22]Link is here because I invited him.
[60:32.84]With such unprecedented rainfall, we have no choice but to rely on the aid of a trustworthy Hylian.
[60:39.08]Have we not already discussed this and arrived at that very conclusion?
[60:42.58]He's the key to saving Zora's domain.
[60:44.64]I have no doubt in my mind.
[60:47.00]Indeed, Link is a champion, through and through.
[60:49.92]As things now stand in Zora's domain, nay, perhaps all of Hyrule is doomed to be swallowed by the sea.
[60:55.87]This is bigger than all of us, my friend.
[60:57.41]Zora and Hylians alike must put aside our differences and band together.
[61:02.27]Have you forgotten already, my king?
[61:03.95]We cannot trust these lowly Hylians.
[61:06.30]A hundred years ago, they abused the power of an ancient civilization and turned Hyrule into what it is today.
[61:10.96]And that is not the least of it.
[61:21.03]It's their fault that Lady Mipha was lost to us.
[61:23.57]Took a long time for him to figure that out.
[61:27.83]Oh.
[61:29.21]Link.
[61:30.55]Divine Beast of Aruda has great power.
[61:32.82]It has the unique ability to create an endless supply of water.
[61:36.30]Of late, it has been mercilessly spouting water into the air.
[61:39.36]As a result, this area has been plagued by heavy rains.
[61:43.10]Can I flip them?
[61:44.62]I'm going to flip them.
[61:46.96]They think it makes more sense for me to flip these.
[61:50.29]For us Zora, water and air are as one, so you would not think this would be quite so critical of a problem.
[61:57.67]Sadly, the rains have filled the eastern reservoir nearly to the point of flooding.
[62:03.14]If the reservoir bursts, as it soon will, I fear immense damage will befall not only Zora's domain, but also the area downstream from us.
[62:12.32]There, Hylian lives are in very grave danger.
[62:22.81]Divine moves.
[62:43.34]What is this place?
[62:47.74]Bill Clinton.
[62:50.91]Whoa, look at this thing.
[63:07.60]divine beasts of our router your princess zelda often studied the divine beasts that is in the time before the great calamity according to her research the orbs located on router's shoulders are mechanisms that can control the water it generates however they require electricity to work these orbs are clearly out of control now because there's no electricity cursing through to stop them
[63:35.60]Now, second, it was quite shock-resistant for Zora.
[63:38.24]It won with a shock arrow, sure enough.
[63:40.36]It slowed the water down a bit.
[63:42.70]Unfortunately, as an aquatic race, we Zora are terribly vulnerable to the power of electricity.
[63:48.74]Perhaps because we could not safely strike it with enough electricity at once, the water soon returned to its full force.
[63:55.39]That is why I went in search of a Hylian who could help us.
[63:58.99]Link, I'm certain you have already figured this out, but we need you to use shock arrows to get those orbs working properly again.
[64:06.23]I will aid you in any way that I can.
[64:08.09]Of course.
[64:09.19]Please, hero, I beg of you.
[64:10.83]Help me stop Brutus' rampage of destruction.
[64:16.67]What?
[64:18.03]Princess Zelda herself instructed you to board the Divine Beast and appease it from within?
[64:22.97]So then Princess Zelda is still alive?
[64:26.97]Yes, in Hyrule Castle.
[64:28.77]I don't have a voice for Link.
[64:30.81]I do not believe it.
[64:31.57]She was alive this whole time, just as you were.
[64:34.73]The events of a hundred years ago cannot be altered if it is true.
[64:38.47]But if we can regain control of the divine beasts, they may yet prove useful in sealing Calamity Ganon once and for all.
[64:46.10]I did not know they had such grand ambitions, Link.
[64:49.10]Wondrous!
[64:49.80]Naturally, I shall help too.
[64:52.12]Once it has stopped rampaging, you can easily climb inside it.
[64:55.12]Come, Link.
[64:55.76]Let us appease Rooted together.
[64:59.05]Thank you, Link.
[65:00.21]Truly, we are in your debt.
[65:02.46]Our goal is the same.
[65:04.12]That means our meeting was nothing short of destiny.
[65:07.36]Now then, allow me to offer you this gift of a show of faith.
[65:12.04]Zora armor!
[65:13.56]Custom armor painstakingly crafted by each generation Zora princess for her future husband.
[65:18.78]Wearing it will give you the ability to swim up waterfalls.
[65:21.19]As long as you wear this, you can swim up waterfalls.
[65:25.57]Just like I said, please take care of it.
[65:29.62]King Dorphin, surely you do not really intend to give this outsider his Zora armor.
[65:34.84]Countless generations of Zora princesses have gifted that armor to the one they have sworn to marry.
[65:39.98]Princess Mipha made that one there with her own hands.
[65:43.49]It is far too important to entrust to a shady Hylian.
[65:48.39]Yeah, he may be champion, but Mipha had no such relationship with him.
[65:53.79]So why should he receive such an honor?
[65:56.65]This is just too much, my liege.
[65:58.83]I do not understand it one bit.
[66:01.43]That loser is not easily swayed when his mind is set.
[66:04.83]You must understand he was in charge of educating my dear daughter, Mipha.
[66:09.58]Naturally, she means a lot to him.
[66:11.90]Just as she means a lot to me to end the world, too.
[66:16.40]Ever since we lost her to the Calamity, he has grown despising.
[66:21.40]He grew up and he despised Hylians.
[66:24.57]I hope we can forgive his rudeness.
[66:27.67]Hmm, but what shall we do now?
[66:30.23]I tasked Muzu with finding the shock arrows we need to appease Veruta.
[66:34.75]Now he has rushed off in a huff.
[66:40.57]Link, do not let his words concern you.
[66:43.87]I will work this out with Muzu.
[66:45.65]I shall return shortly.
[66:51.84]Oh, here we go.
[66:52.44]Okay.
[66:53.20]Gonna head downstairs real quick.
[66:55.06]There we are.
[66:56.82]These are steep stairs.
[66:59.14]Sidon, I suppose that means you're going to tell him.
[67:04.19]Link Muzu is most likely at the square down below.
[67:06.71]If you mind going down there, I would like you to try to speak with him.
[67:21.81]Somebody said it was like a SpongeBob episode?
[67:25.17]What?
[67:32.63]Awful joke.
[67:40.66]Oh, hold on.
[67:47.06]Hmm.
[67:47.98]You came all the way here, but it was in vain.
[67:50.40]I have no desire to speak with you.
[67:53.09]Listen well, Muzu.
[67:54.45]There's something you need to know.
[67:56.45]He who stands here, the man called Link, is the one who my sister Mipha had feelings for.
[68:02.37]I was only a child, so I did not know it myself at the time, but it is so.
[68:07.23]I grew up hearing my father tell stories, some of which were about my sister's undying love for a Hylian named Link.
[68:15.05]What?
[68:15.31]No!
[68:19.18]You cannot fool me with such a fanciful lie.
[68:21.78]Not this sorrow.
[68:24.33]How could Lady Mipha possibly have feelings for a Hylian like him?
[68:28.14]The facts are clear.
[68:29.46]He remembers nothing.
[68:30.92]Even when he looks upon Princess Mipha's statue.
[68:34.22]It's the truth, Muzu.
[68:35.88]Though you never knew it, he was ever in Mipha's heart.
[69:17.59]I was thinking I was thinking this reminds me of the time I well I can't do it and I'll show up you were just a reckless child
[69:26.14]Always getting yourself hurt at every turn.
[69:30.14]Every time I would heal you, just as I'm doing right now.
[69:37.72]I thought it was funny how, being a Hylian, you looked grown up so much faster than I did.
[69:47.83]I was... I was always willing to heal your wounds.
[69:52.77]Even back then.
[70:06.17]So if this Calamity Ganon does in fact return, what can we really do?
[70:11.96]We just don't seem to know much about what we'll be up against.
[70:17.78]But know this, that no matter how difficult this battle might get, if you, if anyone ever tries to do you harm, then I will heal you.
[70:30.91]No matter when or how bad the wound, I hope you know
[70:36.98]All I'm saying is, I mean, you give me a full suit of armor, a dagger, and three grenades, and I would do it.
[70:45.35]I'd be fine.
[71:13.00]And like five bologna and cheese sandwiches.
[71:15.72]And I would save the day here.
[71:20.96]I would do it in three days.
[71:21.80]Okay.
[71:35.73]What?
[71:36.92]Do not mistake me for a fool, Hylian.
[71:39.08]There is no way you remembered her just now, when it is most convenient.
[71:42.83]In any case, without any solid proof, I cannot possibly take you at your word.
[71:47.31]If you have any such proof, now is the time to show it.
[71:51.57]Do so, and I shall tell you how to get those shock arrows.
[71:56.75]Yes, as well as anything else you wish to know.
[72:07.97]Sorry, that was a long cutscene.
[72:08.99]I just need to run around a circle for a second.
[72:10.71]Alright, so I need to bring you proof that I know who this is?
[72:15.57]Step in full lucky for us, we have proof.
[72:17.76]Link, go ahead and show Muzu the Zora armor my father gave you.
[72:20.96]Wasn't he in the room?
[72:22.64]Wait, wasn't this guy in the room when I got the armor?
[72:24.90]I want you to prove to me that you knew who we are.
[72:31.15]Link, here's the armor.
[72:33.58]How would you get that?
[72:34.60]Oh, I like you.
[72:35.38]Wait, I don't get it.
[72:36.08]I have to put it on?
[72:38.12]You were in the room when he gave it to me.
[72:53.42]Oh, it has to activate.
[72:54.74]I get it.
[72:55.06]Okay.
[72:57.42]You really think changing your clothes is going to make me... Oh!
[73:04.93]That's the Zora armor from before.
[73:06.53]It even made that by hand and it fits you perfectly.
[73:11.47]What is the meaning of this?
[73:14.97]Now you understand, do you not?
[73:17.07]Now you know who her heart belonged to and who she made this special armor for.
[73:20.92]Oh my goodness.
[73:23.76]How could it be?
[73:24.26]Another men's small?
[73:26.60]No way.
[73:27.82]It's impossible.
[73:30.22]I don't know how.
[73:34.52]Now, the fact that this armor fits Link perfectly should be made proof that Mipha made it for him and him alone.
[73:40.88]You've always disliked Hylians, even before the Great Calamity.
[73:43.48]That is why Mipha never told you.
[73:47.42]Now that you know, you must promise to help him save us all.
[73:51.69]Please, tell us where we can find the shock arrows we need.
[73:54.25]Knowing you, I bet you have already figured it out.
[73:55.91]Hmm.
[73:57.71]Never would have imagined she would make that special armor for one such as her.
[74:01.97]Hmm?
[74:03.47]Hmm?! !
[74:11.60]Do not approve of asking for help from a Hylian, but I suppose it is our only option at this point.
[74:17.03]I am a proud Zora.
[74:18.23]That means I must take responsibility for my unwarranted behavior towards you.
[74:22.13]As promised, I shall tell you where you can collect as many shock arrows as you will ever need.
[74:31.23]That tall mountain over yonder is called Ploimus Mountain, and there you will find Shatterback Point.
[74:37.57]A terrifying creature has made its home up there.
[74:39.93]This awful beast shoots volley after volley of shock arrows.
[74:43.43]Even a single one could be fatal to a Zorro.
[74:47.15]Aha!
[74:49.23]You must mean that Lynel.
[74:51.79]He's a man-beast, that one.
[74:54.07]That beast does indeed wield shock arrows.
[74:56.79]Certainly one way to collect them.
[74:58.94]He's vicious to be sure.
[75:00.86]I'm certain Link will rise to the challenge.
[75:03.86]Why do you still doubt him?
[75:05.06]No doubt he'll be triumphant.
[75:14.76]Okay, Link, let's go.
[75:15.72]Get out of here.
[75:16.80]Fastest way to ply this mountain is to ascend the waterfall east of the domain.
[75:22.17]Zora armor should come in handy.
[75:23.29]Just swim up the waterfall.
[75:25.23]And then go up to the waterfall.
[75:27.09]I'm not reading.
[75:28.41]Await at East Reservoir Lake, right by the Divine Beast.
[75:32.22]Gather at least 20 shock arrows and then come join me.
[75:34.92]Okay.
[75:37.30]Wonderful.
[75:37.76]Together we shall stop that Divine Beast's onslaught.
[75:44.91]Just made the most scrumptious cake.
[75:52.83]Alright, let's do it.
[76:01.64]You guys remember like three years ago?
[76:05.26]When I would do the Neelix impression every two streams?
[76:09.74]I was on that for a long time.
[76:12.59]I did it every two or three streams.
[76:14.13]I said it like five times a stream.
[76:15.82]I was obsessed with it.
[76:23.12]Good morning.
[76:24.50]Welcome to Marot Mart.
[76:27.44]This is where you'll find our general store.
[76:28.92]Okay, cool.
[76:30.00]Cool.
[76:32.40]Um, let's look at the store.
[76:33.70]Hmm.
[76:47.34]Wait, this is not the store?
[76:48.73]This is the store.
[76:52.43]What do you got?
[76:54.53]Violet?
[76:56.41]Salt?
[76:56.79]Ooh, I think I need some salt.
[76:59.79]I'll take them all.
[77:00.23]48 rupees!
[77:02.05]Excuse me?
[77:02.37]48 rupees?
[77:19.60]I don't have to pay for that, right?
[77:31.31]Hey.
[77:32.51]You're a Hylian, aren't you?
[77:33.61]It's rare to see your kind around here.
[77:36.21]As for me, I was roaming nearby during my... As for me, I was roaming nearby during my travels when Prince Sidon recruited me and brought me here.
[77:47.14]That's because I can touch shock arrows.
[77:51.52]There's no way I'll be able to carry you on my back.
[77:56.32]That's what Prince Sidon said to me.
[77:58.74]That's kind of rude of him, don't you think?
[78:03.08]Voice acting!
[78:07.74]How about this one?
[78:08.28]If I'm going to do some voice acting, why not?
[78:10.50]Let's do this one.
[78:12.58]I told her the Hylian who stole Lady Mipha was...
[78:16.98]in here like nothing happened.
[78:18.96]What business do you have after all these years?
[78:21.17]Oh, it's a weapons workshop.
[78:26.59]Oh, cool.
[78:27.05]Okay.
[78:28.41]What are you doing?
[78:29.69]Well, I tried maintenance, you know.
[78:32.83]Oh, nice.
[78:34.49]Okay.
[78:34.85]Well, nice to see you.
[78:37.19]What other voices can I do?
[78:40.73]Oh, how about you?
[78:41.77]I gotta help this dude voice acting.
[78:43.76]Oh, pardon me.
[78:45.16]Could you please get out of the way?
[78:51.78]I'm a Hylian.
[78:52.44]I can do one thing.
[78:55.88]I can literally do one thing.
[79:19.94]Oh, it's you.
[79:20.76]Oh, wait.
[79:21.16]There's a quest here.
[79:21.68]Hold on.
[79:24.20]Okay.
[79:29.06]You need materials.
[79:36.00]What kind?
[79:37.84]Luminous stone.
[79:38.34]I think I already have these, don't I?
[79:39.36]If you have ten of them, that would be a big help.
[79:45.55]I think I already have that.
[79:46.35]Hmm?
[79:51.00]Here are the stones.
[79:54.72]Thank you.
[79:55.14]Alright.
[79:55.91]Is this like... Should I not do this?
[79:59.53]And a one.
[80:00.93]And a two.
[80:02.29]And a three.
[80:03.35]Four.
[80:04.09]Five.
[80:04.89]Six.
[80:06.35]Seven.
[80:07.83]Eight.
[80:08.71]Nine.
[80:09.16]What?
[80:15.90]What?
[80:24.48]A bunch of bullshit.
[80:25.58]Okay.
[80:26.66]Alright, so I need to... This is where we go.
[80:29.38]Collect arrows.
[80:34.18]What's the fastest way to get up here?
[80:40.57]I imagine from where I am, right?
[80:44.61]I want to cook some food, though.
[80:47.05]I'm not just going there.
[80:47.88]I need to cook some food.
[80:49.12]Where's the chef?
[80:58.27]What do you have to say?
[80:58.83]What was it again?
[81:00.43]I'm just kidding.
[81:02.27]I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[81:07.73]Go to the waterfall?
[81:11.68]I should get some more arrows.
[81:12.62]Uh, I'll buy some of these.
[81:14.80]These are useful.
[81:19.46]The fish, too.
[81:21.60]Yeah, take the whole thing.
[81:25.60]Huh?
[81:33.93]XD, oh my god, you're such a kidder.
[81:35.32]I know.
[81:37.74]I think I'm going to buy all the regular arrows.
[81:47.72]How much is it for everything?
[81:48.94]Yeah, I'll take them all.
[81:53.42]Swim up the waterfall.
[81:55.54]Yeah, I want to cook food first though.
[81:58.91]Make some cold elixir things or something.
[82:03.19]How do you cook food here?
[82:04.19]The inn?
[82:09.90]Top left.
[82:39.29]Up right.
[82:39.75]Hey, quest.
[82:54.88]Hello.
[82:56.18]You are Link, right?
[82:59.18]Why do you ask?
[83:01.40]Prince Sidon ran off through the eastern gate.
[83:05.02]He was shouting something like, I'm off to stop the divine beast.
[83:09.30]Link, the Hylian is coming with me.
[83:10.84]I assume that means you're going up Ploymas Mountain in search of shock arrows.
[83:16.23]Yes.
[83:17.91]I have a request.
[83:20.09]What is it?
[83:24.89]There's a red-maned monster called a Lynel that lives on Ploymas Mountain.
[83:29.87]I really need a picture of a Lynel.
[83:33.65]Of any red-maned Lynel.
[83:35.46]Not just the one on the mountain.
[83:37.24]What do you say?
[83:37.64]Can you give me a picture?
[83:38.62]Sure.
[83:44.25]Okay.
[83:47.77]There's this fool in the domain who goads people into jumping off Shatterback Point on Ploymus Mountain.
[83:53.41]It's an incredibly dangerous jump, and this guy pressures people into jumping off by questioning their courage.
[83:58.30]He's a real bottom feeder.
[83:59.52]If this keeps up, someone is surely going to wind up horribly injured.
[84:02.88]I need a picture of a Lionel to show everyone how scary they are.
[84:05.40]Maybe people will stop going up there.
[84:07.80]Does that answer your question?
[84:09.58]I'll leave the details to you.
[84:10.82]Just bring me a picture.
[84:13.97]I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but how about I leave the camera with you, I go on the top of the mountain, and I'm going to do a dive off that mountain.
[84:26.08]You get a picture of me halfway down.
[84:35.41]I'll do a flip.
[84:41.95]Go to the inn.
[84:47.40]Is there... What happened?
[84:54.54]No!
[84:55.42]Please climb it.
[85:12.21]Nobody saw that.
[85:18.04]How do I?
[85:18.42]I'm just teleporting back up here.
[85:19.94]What the fuck, dude?
[85:29.98]Title update?
[85:30.70]Oh, shit, the title's the same.
[85:35.17]I wanna cook.
[85:44.87]Read the clothing.
[85:52.29]Swim up waterfalls.
[85:53.17]Okay.
[85:53.55]Yeah, I know.
[85:56.60]Yeah, I know.
[85:56.94]I just want to cook.
[86:00.80]So somebody said go to the inn.
[86:06.45]Alright.
[86:06.79]Is there a... Is there a chef pot here?
[86:09.07]There's a chef pot right there.
[86:13.97]Alright, nice.
[86:14.39]Here we go.
[86:17.67]I got a lot of shit to make.
[86:19.16]So...
[86:22.55]Long-lasting flame for using your firewood, right?
[86:24.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[86:31.49]Elixir ingredient.
[86:33.35]Should I make elixirs?
[86:39.59]Okay.
[86:41.12]Cook dishes that will allow you to endure the cold.
[86:43.24]So let me hold this.
[86:45.54]Two of these.
[86:47.76]Um...
[86:53.77]with monster part oh let me do that um stop holding monster parts this is a monster part right so if I do how many of these should I put in together so this is technically a monster part so what is the what what's the ratio I should do
[87:18.51]So, okay.
[87:20.39]How many bat wings, how many monster parts do I need to have?
[87:31.84]Why'd you just make me press Y?
[87:32.92]Now I don't know where the fuck I just was.
[87:34.52]What the heck?
[87:37.89]Okay, so should I just do one and one?
[87:42.33]What would happen if I did two bat wings and one lizard?
[87:45.99]What's the difference?
[87:46.59]What happens?
[87:47.70]Always do 50-50.
[87:49.56]One to one is fine.
[87:52.54]There were two huge raids that just came in.
[87:55.22]Granny came in with a thousand people and then lots of monster parts.
[88:01.37]Okay.
[88:02.19]And then Ramola.
[88:04.83]Those are monster raids.
[88:06.17]Welcome, everybody.
[88:08.57]Ramolo?
[88:08.85]Am I saying that right?
[88:12.49]What's up?
[88:14.65]Thanks for the raids, guys.
[88:15.79]Everybody.
[88:16.71]Welcome.
[88:17.53]Welcome, guys.
[88:20.92]Raid song.
[88:22.10]There you go.
[88:23.96]No, we need to kill that meme.
[88:25.66]No more of that.
[88:26.56]I don't want you guys doing that.
[88:27.40]I don't want you guys singing that.
[88:29.16]We're killing that meme.
[88:30.42]Today.
[88:32.38]But no, thanks.
[88:33.02]Thanks for the raids.
[88:34.75]Hope you had a good stream, whatever you're doing.
[88:36.41]We're playing Breath of the Wild.
[88:41.52]I'm trying to figure out how to cook food because I don't get it.
[88:44.02]I mean, I do get it, but I don't.
[88:44.91]Alright, I'm going to do two bat wings and two lizards.
[88:53.87]That makes sense to me.
[88:54.53]Okay, two bat wings and two lizards.
[89:00.02]What does it do?
[89:00.40]Okay.
[89:13.80]420.
[89:13.82]Boost your movement speed while running.
[89:17.46]Wasn't it cold?
[89:18.26]Okay, now let me cook some other shit too.
[89:24.06]When cooked into a dish, temporarily increases your maximum hearts.
[89:26.48]Alright, let's put that in here.
[89:31.29]So I only do one effect.
[89:37.05]Some salt?
[89:42.69]And that's it.
[89:54.16]Alright, nice.
[89:54.82]That's awesome.
[89:56.12]Okay, I need to make some more.
[89:57.12]What's this?
[89:59.42]Electrical resistance.
[90:01.50]Yep.
[90:06.40]A fucking apple?
[90:15.29]Two mushrooms.
[90:18.13]And a third mushroom.
[90:29.95]Four minutes of electricity resistance.
[90:32.65]Okay, now what?
[90:36.26]Cook one radish and see what happens.
[90:45.32]Jesus!
[90:47.94]What?
[90:51.64]Why would you ever make another food?
[90:56.20]Would you ever make another food for any reason?
[91:04.67]Radish it out, yeah.
[91:09.75]Okay, what about meat?
[91:17.42]Double meat.
[91:18.92]And... I have too much stealth bullshit.
[91:27.24]Meat.
[91:28.30]Herbs.
[91:32.60]Oh, and electricity mushroom.
[91:35.10]Right?
[91:37.53]And... A banana.
[91:41.99]Nope.
[91:47.23]Extra... No.
[91:50.97]Two mushrooms.
[91:52.09]No.
[91:52.55]And some salt.
[92:00.79]Whatever.
[92:07.41]Electro Mushroom Skewer.
[92:08.55]Alright.
[92:15.70]This one's cold.
[92:18.46]Three of these.
[92:19.12]Okay, mushrooms.
[92:25.00]This is going to be... So things that increase cold resistance.
[92:29.48]This is a guava.
[92:33.36]I need more cold resistance.
[92:44.19]Heat resistance.
[92:45.59]Ooh, okay, this is going to be fish.
[92:46.77]This is going to be crazy.
[92:52.06]It's gonna be like 40 minutes.
[92:58.48]10 minutes.
[93:00.07]That's a big one.
[93:00.65]Alright, hold on.
[93:07.09]Just truffles individually.
[93:12.95]Here too?
[93:13.39]Yeah, that's pretty good.
[93:22.93]Cook one pepper.
[93:33.32]Too many... Don't eat these because it's not gonna... You don't have that many hearts.
[93:40.00]Make an electro mushroom risotto.
[93:45.81]What does milk do?
[93:51.51]Okay, let's do... I didn't want to eat that.
[93:55.62]I wanted to pull... I don't know why I did that.
[93:58.80]Eating raw wheat?
[94:00.24]Whatever this is.
[94:00.78]Rice?
[94:01.06]Okay, so then I need... What else do I got?
[94:11.56]Attack power.
[94:14.00]Double banana.
[94:15.20]This is going to be gross.
[94:25.73]Ooh, four minutes of attack power.
[94:27.07]Increases defense?
[94:34.60]Oh, check this out.
[94:42.05]This is defense, right?
[94:43.09]What about a crab?
[94:43.71]This is gonna be... ...crazy. ...
[94:59.41]This is a high level defense boost for four minutes.
[95:21.88]Two and a half minutes of low level.
[95:23.32]That's alright.
[95:27.95]Movement speed.
[95:29.03]Alright.
[95:29.41]What if I do three of these?
[95:31.62]A little dash of salt.
[95:41.97]Not very much.
[95:43.49]Not very much.
[95:59.53]Kind of running out of food to mix here.
[96:02.09]Purple mushroom.
[96:12.38]Oh, my goodness.
[96:13.24]Alright.
[96:13.88]Yeah.
[96:14.64]Hold on.
[96:14.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:16.42]Back up.
[96:18.05]Stop holding.
[96:18.65]Let's do this again.
[96:19.17]Let's do two of these.
[96:24.13]And three of these.
[96:27.57]Yep.
[96:33.86]Yep.
[96:36.94]Okay, cook it with monster parts to draw out its speed boost effect.
[96:39.56]I don't think that works, right?
[96:42.24]Let's try this.
[96:45.06]Honey mushroom.
[96:51.39]Alright, this is five minutes of high level movement speed.
[96:56.55]It does.
[96:56.89]It's just in elixirs, not in food.
[96:58.37]Okay.
[97:06.02]Okay, rice, milk, salt.
[97:11.64]Honey.
[97:12.62]Yeah.
[97:22.12]Cool.
[97:26.72]Bitter cold.
[97:29.24]Why don't we just do all five?
[97:30.92]Wait, isn't there a crab or something that has cold resistance?
[97:37.63]Stamina.
[97:39.36]Attack power.
[97:41.50]Silently.
[97:41.98]Fish here.
[97:44.64]And salt.
[97:45.00]Let's go.
[97:46.58]I mean, I have so much food.
[97:47.68]It doesn't go bad, right?
[97:54.46]11 minutes of mid-level cold.
[97:58.58]Alright.
[97:59.28]VR Josh has a good point.
[98:00.75]I should make stuff that heals for like 4 or 5.
[98:04.37]So I don't just have a bunch of Omega food.
[98:31.14]That's good What about just cooking one fish?
[98:43.09]This is a waste Kind of a waste
[98:57.33]What about this?
[98:58.75]Just five snails.
[99:00.92]Whatever this is.
[99:07.42]Ten minutes of low-level stealth boost.
[99:12.28]I'm gonna... Let's make some elixirs.
[99:16.99]Alright, frog.
[99:17.67]Uh, monster parts.
[99:26.12]The tail.
[99:32.81]And horn?
[99:35.65]Let's try it.
[99:41.25]That was a good one, I guess.
[99:44.39]Oh, it says healing on it, too.
[99:45.62]Okay.
[99:55.32]Stamina recovery elixir.
[100:21.25]That was a good one too, apparently.
[100:29.97]Alright, I think I'm good.
[100:31.52]Heat resistance.
[100:37.24]Attack power.
[100:40.90]Stamina.
[100:46.65]Stealth.
[100:49.03]Defense.
[100:51.59]Stealth.
[100:52.93]Okay, defense.
[101:00.60]Defense.
[101:09.62]Stamina.
[101:13.34]That's good, right?
[101:17.16]What else was defense?
[101:17.95]Something else was here, right?
[101:18.79]Salt.
[101:20.19]Salt.
[101:31.34]salt and the crab but the one that it'll uh it'll negate the other thing right make it extra salty okay
[101:58.28]I'm going to hold off the rest.
[101:59.24]I have a lot of food.
[102:01.28]Look at all this food.
[102:02.34]I've got so much.
[102:04.98]Yeah, look at all this.
[102:05.58]How about a tree nut?
[102:12.45]Two milks.
[102:14.05]A rice.
[102:16.05]And a mushroom.
[102:21.09]Here's your mushroom risotto.
[102:26.09]That's good.
[102:28.89]Okay.
[102:30.35]I think I got enough food and I have- I have plenty of really good items.
[102:35.31]I'm kind of decked out right now.
[102:40.19]Got plenty of food.
[102:40.83]So now go swim up the waterfall.
[102:57.04]How far away is this waterfall?
[103:03.72]Where's this waterfall that it's talking about?
[103:05.22]Save the game.
[103:05.70]Good call.
[103:15.30]East.
[103:16.92]Is that right there?
[103:43.27]Yeah, that's it right there.
[103:47.78]Oh, god damn it.
[103:59.86]Can we please get a Zoinks?
[104:06.55]Fine.
[104:34.09]Like, zoink, Scoob!
[104:36.95]I fucking banned that person.
[104:38.23]I actually banned that person for, like, an hour.
[104:40.15]Because they just made me do that, and I fucking hated it.
[104:43.90]I want that person banned for an hour.
[104:44.80]That's what I'm saying.
[104:49.56]That was, like, not good.
[104:50.88]It was, like, kind of annoying, and it looked bad.
[104:52.72]And, like, I did it wrong.
[104:54.28]I want that person timed out for an hour.
[104:55.34]I genuinely want that person banned.
[105:10.77]It was good.
[105:11.35]No, time that... Okay, maybe not an hour, but at least five minutes.
[105:24.61]Hold on.
[105:47.79]So I need to get up there and walk across this bridge.
[105:58.86]One thing you can say about Jeremiah is he moisturizes.
[106:04.52]You get over 35 and you tell me if it's time to start moisturizing.
[106:26.00]Oops.
[106:27.76]Thought I had this equipped.
[106:29.68]Actually, I need those arrows.
[106:36.04]That's good.
[106:40.30]I started moisturizing because of you.
[106:43.14]You know, there is one thing that I will say.
[106:45.79]If there's a few things that people will take from this stream...
[106:51.04]Don't forget about anything else, right?
[106:55.20]Drink more water.
[106:57.00]Don't drink too much water, though.
[106:58.44]It's like you don't have to be sitting there chugging it.
[107:01.60]Moisturize when you get out of the shower.
[107:03.83]Just a light moisturizer for your face.
[107:05.93]Just put it on.
[107:06.89]It takes two seconds.
[107:09.85]It takes two seconds.
[107:11.87]When you get out of the shower, dry your face.
[107:13.05]Get a nice face moisturizer.
[107:15.81]It takes just a little bit.
[107:16.91]Just smear it on.
[107:17.79]That's it.
[107:18.13]You're done.
[107:32.32]Okay, so I can swim up this.
[107:37.73]Whoa, that's interesting.
[107:59.76]Cool.
[108:00.04]Damn, 37.
[108:00.30]How do you deal with getting older?
[108:03.09]honestly you just do you just everyone gets older that's it there is no oh I have to like no you just everyone's gonna get older eventually you get old but and as long as just just keep a good mindset moisturize drink some water eat eat okay I don't eat the best right
[108:33.21]I know that food pyramid thing I did the other, like, a year ago was a meme, but, you know.
[108:40.23]You know, just take care of yourself.
[108:41.85]Take care of yourself enough.
[108:45.92]Because, honestly, like, taking care of yourself so much to the point where it almost becomes a job on its own, too.
[108:53.76]Right?
[108:54.38]Like, paying attention to how healthy you are, what you're eating.
[108:57.18]No, I can't eat that.
[108:58.22]I don't want to eat that.
[108:58.78]It's bad for me.
[109:00.36]It can be kind of hard.
[109:04.09]But just take care of yourself as well as you can.
[109:07.82]But enjoy life, too.
[109:09.08]Enjoy shit.
[109:12.06]You want to eat a triple cheeseburger one day?
[109:13.64]Do it.
[109:13.92]But don't do it every day.
[109:16.62]Just do it whenever you feel like it.
[109:27.15]Turning 30 in a week, you have any wise words?
[109:30.38]No, you'll be fine.
[109:31.30]You'll be fine.
[109:32.00]Just once you get over 30, you're gonna... You kind of... I don't know.
[109:36.79]You kind of unplug from the matrix.
[109:38.89]And you're just like... Oh, whatever.
[109:42.11]Wait, that's a bad reference.
[109:43.04]That means that that's a... Okay, hold on.
[109:44.26]Let me redo that.
[109:45.72]Who is this?
[109:57.18]That's good, right?
[109:58.12]Shit.
[110:01.10]They're going to find this on my dead body.
[110:18.82]Oh my goodness, you almost killed me in one fucking hit.
[110:23.99]Defense?
[110:24.37]I'm going to do defense.
[110:26.57]Here's my defense food.
[110:30.45]Health.
[110:31.31]This is... Which one is his defense?
[110:33.02]This one here, right?
[110:33.60]Alright.
[110:35.12]Two and a half minutes of mid-level defense boost.
[110:42.21]Let's go.
[110:59.02]I got it.
[110:59.30]Did that do anything?
[111:01.16]I feel like that didn't even negate any damage.
[111:10.19]I got the picture, right?
[111:18.69]That one is actually better.
[111:38.64]Can I at least get one hit?
[111:41.30]Let me try to get one swing on this guy.
[111:50.24]Don't fight?
[111:50.78]Why not?
[111:54.98]So, is it a horizontal or vertical swing?
[111:58.13]Okay.
[111:58.87]Okay.
[112:12.28]Okay, I can fight this.
[112:13.58]I can kill this for sure.
[112:14.34]I just have to dodge better.
[112:16.80]I have to dodge better.
[112:24.27]It's two horizontal swings, that's it.
[112:37.57]He's standing in water!
[112:38.31]Are you kidding me?
[112:50.58]so so
[113:43.80]What was that?
[113:48.48]Dude, what are you doing?
[113:49.50]I'm gonna break every weapon on this guy.
[114:05.23]This is actually bad, isn't it?
[114:10.68]These are all my cool weapons.
[114:13.23]what if every single one of them breaks whatever let's go
[114:44.55]No thanks.
[115:14.78]I'm alright.
[115:15.12]I'm okay.
[115:15.56]I'm okay.
[115:15.96]I'm okay.
[115:30.82]I don't want to eat the high level one.
[115:33.89]I think I just want to heal.
[115:34.91]Just heal.
[115:35.31]That's it.
[115:38.99]Everything is so good.
[115:43.74]I'm gonna eat this.
[115:44.40]Let's go.
[115:48.46]Got him.
[116:21.10]It's larger and heavier than a horse's hoof.
[116:22.78]It's useful for making elixirs.
[116:26.45]Wait.
[116:31.99]Look what I did, right?
[116:33.55]I have to prove that I did this.
[116:36.25]Otherwise, I don't think that she'll believe me.
[116:43.24]Wait, yeah, I don't know.
[116:43.74]It's going to be a selfie.
[116:52.85]Okay.
[116:53.75]Otherwise, how can I... Wait, you didn't even kill it.
[116:56.25]Yes, I did.
[117:01.90]Lionel's sword.
[117:02.84]24.
[117:05.80]Oh, man.
[117:08.30]I'm gonna hide... Oh, shit.
[117:11.79]What is 10 times 3?
[117:12.43]3 arrows?
[117:21.68]This thing's almost broken.
[117:22.54]Just get rid of it.
[117:27.70]I can't throw this away.
[117:28.54]Whatever.
[117:33.04]I was a bow.
[117:33.79]I'm an idiot.
[117:44.49]And then Lionel's shield.
[117:49.08]I can really only... Okay, wait a minute.
[117:51.70]Which one of these is better?
[117:53.92]Am I just wasting the... Get rid of one of the guardian shields?
[118:05.35]That feels terrible.
[118:07.69]It's only the number that matters.
[118:08.87]Okay.
[118:10.27]Just the number that matters.
[118:11.59]It's only the number that matters.
[118:15.33]Oh, look at how cool this is, though.
[118:19.82]Alright, I'll get rid of it.
[118:20.60]I thought it said keep the Frenic Bow.
[118:31.18]What should I get rid of instead?
[118:45.07]The Lysol Bow?
[118:46.43]Soldier's Bow?
[118:48.31]Frenic is good.
[118:48.99]Frenic is good for long range.
[118:50.37]Okay.
[118:54.33]Should I get rid of the soldier's bow?
[118:59.89]Soldier's bow sucks.
[119:02.84]Okay.
[119:06.64]Well, that was cool.
[119:07.50]I killed it and I got the sword and shit.
[119:15.40]Let's see what it looks like.
[119:16.10]24.
[119:16.12]Very cool.
[119:17.72]Alright, let's go.
[119:30.27]Here are the shock arrows.
[119:31.23]I need 20 of these.
[119:45.93]Shock arrow.
[119:48.36]Oh, what am I doing?
[119:49.14]Okay, take a picture of it and then set the, uh, the beep beep for it.
[119:56.01]That's what I should be doing.
[120:21.79]Go.
[120:53.69]I didn't do this at all in my playthrough.
[120:56.73]I am going to tell you I probably won't do it that much in mine either.
[121:00.13]Because I will forget it exists.
[121:02.05]Okay.
[121:26.43]How many do I have now?
[121:32.12]Oh shit, there's a lot.
[121:45.49]There's a million up here!
[121:58.38]What's this?
[122:02.23]Jump at your- Oh, this is the jump point!
[122:08.37]Wait, that's the guardian right there!
[122:10.95]That's the guardian right there!
[122:12.05]I'm not ready, I need 20.
[122:14.39]I have 18, I need 20, right?
[122:44.81]Where are they?
[122:51.31]Oh, they're up... They're not just at the base of the trees.
[122:53.45]Alright, there's 20 right here.
[123:03.14]Alright, I have 20 arrows.
[123:07.98]It wasn't 25, right?
[123:16.30]Save, save, save, save, save, save, save.
[123:23.83]20, but the more the better.
[123:27.20]Well, I might as well be prepared.
[124:10.22]Take it, man.
[124:12.88]Take it.
[124:14.38]Take it!
[124:27.31]I think I got them all.
[124:33.45]I believe that... Oh, nope.
[125:00.20]Is it once in this tree higher?
[125:01.52]Oh, sorry.
[125:11.34]Alright.
[125:13.87]I think that's good.
[125:15.15]I'm ready.
[125:15.49]I'm going to go fight the first divine beast of the game.
[125:20.01]The divine elephant, I think.
[125:31.12]Let's go.
[125:46.81]Okay.
[125:55.32]Jump at your own risk.
[126:30.73]Um... What was that?
[127:01.49]What's your problem?
[127:36.99]Into the, um... steam or something?
[128:12.42]I'm not losing those two hearts.
[128:15.38]Not happening.
[128:15.86]Okay, well the quest marker is over here.
[128:26.05]So I'm imagining maybe I have to go to like the dock or something.
[128:28.47]Is there a dock over here?
[128:29.23]Oh, okay.
[128:39.89]Okay.
[128:42.16]Sidon is right here.
[128:43.12]There we go.
[128:55.43]Alright, so I have my shock arrows equipped.
[129:04.60]I want my strong bow, knight's bow equipped.
[129:07.28]I'm ready to do this.
[129:08.79]Let's go.
[129:14.83]Glad to see you're ready to go, Link.
[129:15.91]Are you ready for this?
[129:21.91]Do you have your Zora armor and enough shock arrows?
[129:25.26]Ready.
[129:28.48]Let us go and appease that divine beast.
[129:30.76]Here we go.
[129:39.31]Gaze now upon the divine beast's back.
[129:51.30]Shoot the glowing pink orbs with a shock arrow.
[129:53.94]Okay.
[129:59.97]I shall take you right up to the side of the Divine Beast, and from there you can swim and take aim.
[130:04.91]I know you can do it.
[130:05.49]I believe in you.
[130:06.55]Hurry up and get on my back.
[130:10.42]Good answer.
[130:10.90]Here we go.
[130:27.18]Full speed, it's up to you.
[130:28.36]Ward off the attacks.
[130:31.36]Are you ready?
[130:32.36]Divine Beast Varuna will undoubtedly use its ancient... laser!
[130:37.29]And that includes hurling giant ice blocks!
[130:41.37]Let's go!
[130:43.53]Watch that ice.
[130:45.97]He talks?!
[130:49.23]How am I gonna watch that ice?
[130:50.91]How do I stop the ice?
[131:01.11]I haven't blocked one.
[131:02.06]Hey!
[131:18.68]How do I stop the ice?
[131:31.45]I made him hit his head.
[131:33.77]Oh, fuck.
[131:37.97]I think I'm missing something here.
[131:39.11]Oh, I can shatter it.
[131:41.35]I can shatter them.
[131:47.28]Shatter it.
[131:48.10]Oh, my God.
[131:48.66]I'm restarting.
[131:57.88]Yeah.
[131:59.30]Get up there.
[132:06.79]Oh!
[132:17.98]Help!
[132:19.18]Help!
[132:20.30]Help!
[132:22.08]What the fuck?
[132:29.37]You let me drown, dude!
[132:30.71]What the hell?
[132:43.34]We're getting closer.
[132:51.13]Okay.
[132:57.22]Alright, that's it.
[133:00.76]Sidon, where are you?
[133:05.74]Let's go.
[133:08.86]Stop swimming around.
[133:11.44]Stop doing the... Bro, there ain't nothing here.
[133:36.50]Oh, I got...
[134:05.92]Get this fucking blue shell out of here!
[134:21.51]Ready.
[134:37.76]Got them all.
[134:41.30]Now it's time.
[134:43.04]What an absolute grill.
[135:00.27]Oh, that was the rain.
[135:01.41]OK, that's that's cool.
[135:06.79]Floating higher, you want to venture inside of it, right?
[135:11.49]I'll bring you close.
[135:12.73]Counting on you.
[135:13.47]Do good work in there.
[135:14.49]I have to go inside?
[135:18.85]This is not just a boss?
[135:30.08]Well, Link, here we are.
[135:32.24]Looks like this is where the real work starts.
[135:36.24]This thing's pissed.
[136:17.96]Do I have my five bologna sandwiches, three grenades, and a dagger?
[136:27.35]Oh, and I got an iPod.
[136:37.70]Just give me an iPod with, like, the entire Bill Burr podcast on it.
[136:42.30]Just every episode.
[136:43.26]I'll be good.
[136:55.03]You're here.
[137:03.86]I must say that I am so happy to see that this day has finally arrived.
[137:12.46]Now, Ruta can be freed of Ganon's control.
[137:19.43]You'll need a map to prevent you from getting lost.
[137:33.60]The Guidance Stone there contains the information that you will need.
[137:40.99]So.
[137:42.11]Alright, so this is just a big shrine.
[137:56.21]OK, so if you hit the eye, the eye closes.
[138:10.34]Interesting.
[138:15.60]Cool.
[138:21.39]Okay.
[138:22.61]Okay, so.
[138:34.49]An eye right here.
[138:37.15]Shock arrow!
[138:39.82]Wait, I can't electrify the water I'm standing in, right?
[139:02.32]This is the first real dungeon.
[139:03.66]Good luck.
[139:20.10]So would you say that these dungeons are more traditional Zelda?
[139:28.00]Divine Beast controls have been enabled.
[139:31.62]Yes.
[139:32.00]Okay.
[139:32.84]No.
[139:34.14]A lot more yeses than noes.
[139:34.90]Okay.
[139:35.02]Okay.
[139:35.14]Whoa.
[140:01.72]That's very interesting.
[140:02.98]Okay, so where am I?
[140:04.62]Alright, there's a thing down here.
[140:06.94]I can manipulate move trunk?
[140:13.93]Wait.
[140:17.09]Wait, what?
[140:46.47]Okay.
[140:56.09]What's in here?
[140:56.53]Okay, use my Sheikah tablet.
[141:05.08]Remember, this is the first playthrough.
[141:06.24]Yeah, it is.
[141:10.70]Okay, so this is where the main control unit is.
[141:12.38]So I gotta remember that.
[141:15.70]Where his butt is, right?
[141:16.71]This is where the main control valve is.
[141:21.01]Please remember that, because I won't.
[141:24.15]Alright.
[141:25.13]So I am here.
[141:26.51]I'm gonna bang a right.
[141:36.14]I need to go this way.
[141:36.88]Oh wait, what's this?
[141:44.70]Oh, this can be manipulated.
[141:47.21]Oh, this can be manipulated.
[141:48.33]This is going to fall, isn't it?
[142:04.06]I'll move.
[142:09.20]Blink, you fucking idiot.
[142:18.65]Cool.
[142:19.97]There's one, so now I gotta go... I gotta go up a level.
[142:23.72]This way?
[142:24.12]Oh.
[143:03.07]So they were preparing me for this fight.
[143:14.77]Oh, these things probably drop like crazy now, right?
[143:19.47]Alright.
[143:20.27]Cool.
[143:21.65]I love the way these look.
[143:25.47]I'm buying one of these off Etsy.
[143:27.61]You bet your ass I am.
[143:31.91]OK, so now I got this thing here.
[143:38.29]Well, the room.
[143:42.27]They're going to make this thing turn.
[143:52.65]What if I stop this?
[143:55.76]Can I?
[144:10.76]It's on Etsy right now.
[144:15.34]It's on Etsy.
[144:15.86]Nobody buy that.
[144:16.64]There's only one of them left.
[144:17.88]Don't buy that one.
[144:19.63]That thing looks awesome.
[144:20.67]Only one left.
[144:21.73]No one buy that.
[144:22.39]Okay.
[144:48.37]What about out here?
[144:50.20]Maybe I can't do anything with it yet.
[144:51.20]Do I have to get inside?
[144:54.80]Oh, I know what to do.
[145:00.35]Now you're thinking about gas.
[145:14.65]I don't know why I went like this.
[145:16.65]Now you're working with gas.
[145:18.78]Why did I like tilt my head this way?
[145:34.82]Hmm.
[145:36.88]How do I move this though?
[145:55.58]Well, I'm going to get this.
[145:56.54]100 rupees.
[146:03.08]Alright.
[146:04.12]I'll take it.
[146:07.13]Should I try to stop the flow of water?
[146:16.89]What can I even manipulate here?
[146:18.47]I can manipulate this shit.
[146:20.73]Wait a minute.
[146:22.83]Can I just get in here?
[146:32.08]I don't think I can just get in there.
[146:40.20]Shit.
[146:44.01]Fuck.
[146:52.35]I know I said give me three grenades.
[146:53.71]What would I do?
[146:54.33]What would I use them for?
[146:56.81]I would go through all five sandwiches and just be starving in here and be like, I should have asked for more sandwiches.
[147:01.49]Why did I bring the grenades?
[147:05.50]I would be desperately asking for one or two more sandwiches.
[147:08.48]What was the point of the grenades?
[147:11.98]I don't even know why.
[147:12.50]I don't even need the dagger.
[147:13.72]Okay, I think I can do this.
[147:27.80]alright so now um is this stupid what I'm doing
[148:51.85]Oh, look at that!
[148:53.87]Where am I?
[148:54.33]Put that down.
[149:11.29]I need to stop this from moving.
[149:20.44]Can I?
[149:23.42]Oh, look at that.
[149:25.10]Alright, cool.
[149:26.30]I didn't know you could do that.
[149:30.14]Uh, OK.
[149:37.05]So ideally goes all the way.
[149:37.89]I have to stop it when it gets to be right here.
[149:46.99]Like right... now.
[149:50.11]Is that good enough?
[150:23.27]Is it draining the water?
[150:26.15]It is.
[150:26.63]Okay.
[150:27.03]Well, I didn't think it was going to drain the water.
[150:29.99]It's draining the water.
[150:30.71]I didn't think it was going to drain the water.
[150:36.97]We had a frame drop?
[150:37.79]Whoa!
[150:38.39]We did.
[150:38.71]Holy shit.
[150:39.29]Why?
[150:39.43]That was weird.
[150:50.21]That was a bad one.
[151:03.64]There we go.
[151:06.00]Gonna try.
[151:10.02]Okay.
[151:11.84]Now that being said... What do I do with this?
[151:16.71]I mean, what is this shit all over there?
[151:21.05]This is, um... Junk right here.
[151:41.18]What are you trying to communicate?
[151:44.06]Octopois arm?
[151:49.20]What are you communicating here?
[152:04.53]Maybe I should keep going.
[152:12.81]What are you communicating?
[152:13.71]An octopus arm.
[152:34.52]Octopus arm slug.
[152:40.07]Omega lull octopus arm face.
[152:43.65]Octopus arm fish.
[152:56.10]Wait a minute.
[153:05.16]Is that what you mean when you're going like this?
[153:09.85]That's not what you meant?
[153:11.73]Oh, it is?
[153:12.14]But how come it didn't work?
[153:45.08]Oh shit.
[153:46.02]Um...
[154:22.34]I did it!
[154:22.74]I didn't do it.
[154:32.92]Okay, I get it now though.
[154:53.84]I understand.
[155:47.88]ancient ancient core I'm alright
[156:49.27]Shit's upside down.
[157:42.67]Can I make it go faster?
[157:43.78]How do I make it go the other way?
[157:51.89]Can it turn the other way?
[158:26.55]How do I make it go the other way?
[158:36.71]Okay.
[158:57.20]Why is everybody going like this?
[158:58.46]Wait.
[159:11.58]This is open.
[159:13.50]I'm able to see it.
[159:29.42]Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.
[159:31.77]I'm not ready.
[160:05.25]I wanted to shoot water down this way.
[160:13.73]Hold on, um, wait.
[160:23.30]Shoot, how do I make it go further?
[160:24.70]Can I make, can I, how do I do this?
[160:33.70]I think I'm gonna block it with the ice.
[160:48.71]What is this?
[160:49.69]What does that mean?
[160:50.57]What's this?
[161:16.00]Oh, I get it.
[161:17.44]I get it.
[161:37.61]Nice.
[161:38.21]Okay.
[161:39.45]Now I see what that is.
[161:43.48]There are two terminals remaining.
[161:45.84]You're nearly there.
[161:49.94]That was a pretty cool pie show.
[162:01.80]How do I get up?
[162:09.34]I guess now I can ride that way.
[162:15.63]Swanky.
[162:16.99]We're good.
[162:45.94]That is bright.
[162:46.58]Okay.
[162:58.09]Another... Oh, shortcut.
[162:59.69]Shortcut back down.
[163:04.47]Cool.
[163:08.98]Very nice.
[163:12.50]Well, I gotta check over here.
[163:38.63]Um, well, okay.
[163:41.80]No secret or anything?
[163:43.52]Chest or something?
[163:44.14]I could have thought there would be a chest or something.
[163:47.58]Oh well.
[163:50.34]I got the shortcut, I'm fine.
[164:05.45]What happened?
[164:08.33]What happened?
[164:22.72]Here we go.
[164:23.14]Night's halberd.
[164:27.89]Very good.
[164:28.45]I'll equip that right now.
[164:29.47]No, let's use the regular guardian spear.
[164:32.97]Alright.
[165:04.42]Alright, so that's gone.
[165:05.28]What does that really do for me though?
[165:19.07]I think I need to keep it moving.
[165:30.51]Can I just climb this?
[165:34.42]Never be that easy, would it?
[165:38.23]Hmm, maybe.
[165:43.83]Hold on.
[165:44.27]Somebody made a gif of you farting out the front door.
[165:52.92]No, it's not.
[166:05.88]Alright, this is just... I can see this in my peripheral.
[166:08.00]It's gotta go.
[166:13.01]Can I swim up that?
[166:16.05]First try.
[166:21.08]No, you can't.
[166:40.14]See the fire.
[166:41.16]OK, this fire.
[166:42.18]I gotta probably put the fire out, but how do I do that?
[167:02.90]Hold on.
[167:05.94]What if I go put it all the way down?
[167:19.06]Because now.
[167:25.80]Can I stand on that?
[167:33.96]Excuse me.
[167:34.44]What the fuck are you doing here?
[167:37.30]Okay.
[167:47.82]Ten fire arrows, nice.
[167:48.92]Shit!
[168:07.27]Huh?
[168:38.74]No, wrong way.
[168:43.16]What the fuck is this?
[168:46.74]Wait, where am I?
[168:47.40]Oh, okay.
[168:58.53]It was right underneath.
[168:59.81]Okay, I screwed up.
[169:15.04]Whoa.
[169:16.52]Holy shit.
[169:22.22]Okay.
[170:11.88]ancient shaft
[171:30.38]I think I got it.
[172:05.10]Where is this fucking thing?
[174:16.53]Whoa, what is that?
[174:54.45]alright where where's how do I get up here
[175:23.17]But how do I?
[176:05.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[176:07.83]Yeah!
[176:08.23]I don't know what yeah means!
[176:12.37]Can I make it from here?
[176:13.17]I made it!
[176:36.40]I made it.
[176:36.74]I'm on top.
[176:37.48]I'm on top.
[176:37.94]Alright, now what?
[176:55.73]Now what?
[176:57.61]Oh!
[177:05.22]Whoa!
[177:19.42]Let's go, I got it!
[177:24.27]There it is.
[177:25.29]Hell yeah.
[177:29.15]Hey, remember the person that said see you in five hours?
[177:30.81]It was actually one hour.
[177:33.01]Sorry.
[177:49.54]So this last one is in his head.
[177:54.14]The real question is, how do I get in there?
[178:03.89]It's right in the center of his head.
[178:04.99]Do I just drop straight down?
[178:11.93]I'm kind of afraid to go anywhere.
[178:14.01]Straight down right there, I think that's what I need to do.
[178:33.85]And I think that's it.
[178:34.69]This is definitely it.
[178:37.07]This is it.
[178:37.67]Alright.
[178:43.49]Got it.
[178:43.73]Okay.
[178:47.91]I just gotta spin this.
[179:15.05]Alright, I mean that's pretty self-explanatory.
[179:20.70]Missed it, but that's alright.
[179:21.88]Where's the water?
[179:49.71]I did it.
[179:51.96]Let them out.
[179:54.82]They can be free.
[179:55.42]That was really cool.
[180:04.96]That really was just sort of a super shrine.
[180:54.02]I should probably heal.
[180:54.88]The music does not sound like I just won.
[180:56.42]Maybe defense food or something?
[180:59.87]I think I'm gonna do defense food.
[181:04.05]Sounds good.
[181:09.65]High level defense food or low level defense food?
[181:16.84]Well, let's just see what it is first.
[181:17.94]I'm just gonna heal with just regular ass food.
[181:27.74]This is plus five hearts.
[181:28.90]I'm doing this.
[181:32.14]Let's go.
[181:41.45]Alright, whatever this is, it's time to fight it.
[181:45.27]So I'm going to use my guardian sword.
[181:48.81]And I'm going to use this cool shield.
[181:52.13]Maybe no guard.
[181:52.75]Let's get rid of one of these.
[181:53.49]Alright, let's do it.
[181:55.03]Let's go.
[181:55.25]Alright, fuck you, whatever you are.
[181:58.54]Fuck you, you fucking bloomin' onion.
[182:00.08]Let's go!
[182:41.79]Oh god.
[182:43.95]Water Blight Ganon!
[182:51.97]I thought that was Water Blight Ganon talking.
[183:05.61]Regardless, I believe that you are well prepared for this moment.
[183:08.71]I have faith in you.
[183:10.07]Alright, leave me a voicemail because I'm going to be busy here in a second.
[183:18.86]Careful, that spear has a Long Beach.
[183:28.60]Electricity.
[183:34.37]Electricity.
[183:45.80]Oh shit, where'd he go?
[183:55.85]Whoa!
[184:24.70]oh my god I can even dodge that
[184:52.73]Why are you taking a picture of me?
[184:53.59]What?
[184:54.11]Oh, take a picture.
[184:54.77]OK, yeah.
[184:58.57]No, that's a terrible photo of that.
[185:01.97]I mean, that's kind of cool, though.
[185:14.95]Try to keep the the water.
[185:22.96]No.
[185:23.38]Yes?
[185:24.34]That still counted, right?
[185:25.16]Can the mod chat help me here?
[185:44.46]I think I got a picture of it.
[185:45.68]I think I'm fine.
[185:50.35]I got a photo already.
[186:02.76]Get up!
[186:04.33]He's about to torch the water!
[186:11.76]Link, stop being such a slug!
[186:40.50]I already took a picture.
[186:41.98]Wait.
[186:43.74]They're doing it because the frame lag.
[186:45.46]What?
[186:47.54]What?
[187:10.50]Stop talking!
[187:11.36]Fucking backseat Andy over here.
[187:17.57]My bow is broken.
[187:19.31]Oh!
[187:30.64]No, I- Give me a bow!
[187:47.26]Take this, Calamity Gan!
[187:59.09]So I'm dro- yeah, I am dropping frames, you're right.
[188:04.21]I thought you were saying like, take a picture, take another- I thought I got the photo wrong.
[188:12.84]Pretty good, Cleric Beast.
[188:17.64]I thought he was like, hey dude, what the fuck, you take a picture, take a picture.
[188:28.62]Just dropping a shitload of frames.
[188:30.22]They were doing, uh, yeah, I see, okay.
[188:34.58]What a bad time for frames to drop.
[188:40.01]It was horrible.
[188:44.95]Well, I beat the boss.
[188:48.70]Hold on.
[188:49.22]PowerPoint.
[188:50.29]Let me just see what this looks like.
[188:53.89]What was the viewer experience?
[189:03.38]Oh, my God.
[189:03.98]Can you even dodge that?
[189:18.46]Okay, well that's unfortunate, but whatever.
[189:26.37]Very cool.
[189:26.88]Alright, so now what?
[189:29.24]I'll take my heart container.
[189:36.21]That was really fun.
[189:48.67]Wait, once you activate, you cannot go back in.
[189:50.75]Uh, so I didn't miss anything important, right?
[189:54.99]I think I got pretty much everything important, I think, right?
[190:07.02]You're good?
[190:07.66]Alright, let's go.
[190:10.10]So that's one of four.
[190:18.46]This is probably the easier of the four bosses.
[190:20.22]It doesn't have to be, you know, it doesn't have to be incredibly difficult to be fun.
[190:26.06]I think it was fun.
[190:27.70]It was perfect.
[190:29.56]Just in case you didn't know who that was.
[190:48.54]Since I am now a spirit, my healing power would be wasted on me.
[190:54.52]I have no need of it.
[190:57.28]So therefore, I would like you to have it.
[191:02.21]Please accept Mipha's Grace.
[191:07.87]What does that do?
[191:20.69]A summon?
[191:48.71]Knowing that will let my spirit rest in peace.
[191:53.69]I must go.
[191:57.48]Ruta and I have our roles to fulfill.
[192:01.60]We are both honored to be able to play the role of support.
[192:06.86]We'll annihilate Ganon together.
[192:09.61]Farewell.
[192:11.57]Save her, Link.
[192:13.37]Save the princess.
[192:15.43]Save Princess Zelda.
[192:23.09]Oh, that's cool.
[192:23.93]It's an instant revive on cooldown.
[192:25.95]That's really cool.
[192:26.47]I feel like I could probably use that.
[192:42.16]So this thing is now back under our control.
[193:00.37]Friendly elephant.
[193:01.55]OK.
[193:22.68]Oh.
[193:47.04]You think Calamity Ganon's looking out the window right now?
[193:51.25]Oh no, fuck!
[194:04.86]Ruta, we found a way to be useful to Link.
[194:08.24]And the other champions, of course.
[194:12.56]Our job will be to help Link as he fights Ganon inside the castle, however we can.
[194:19.55]Using your ability to drain Ganon of his power is key to our success.
[194:25.11]This is it.
[194:27.13]This will be our last chance and everyone's last hope.
[194:33.18]Ganon's going to be in the tower and just be looking out.
[194:36.46]Then we can restore peace to Hyrule.
[194:38.40]You'll never get another three.
[194:39.78]You need four.
[194:41.52]You'll never get three more.
[194:42.60]And mine will be fulfilled.
[194:49.45]Father.
[194:51.91]Are you well, I wonder?
[194:54.07]I want you to know I have always followed my heart.
[194:59.69]That's a cool looking tower.
[195:02.86]I wish I could see you again.
[195:07.90]Dude, you need to shut up.
[195:17.92]This is an emotional scene.
[195:25.25]You don't care at all.
[195:26.57]What are you talking about?
[195:28.89]Yeah, I do.
[195:29.31]Cool.
[195:37.66]Oh, that's so awesome.
[195:44.15]Oh.
[197:51.89]Hello?
[199:22.63]Oh, my God.
[199:49.95]It was hard to hold that because he's doing the doggy paddle.
[199:55.11]What is this?
[199:55.69]Alright, hold on.
[200:02.16]Okay, now that's it.
[200:15.83]And that's also going to be the end of the stream.
[200:23.61]I think that's a good place to stop right after that.
[200:28.39]No!
[200:28.93]What are we... Oh, I'm sorry.
[200:37.75]No, you can't.
[200:38.75]No!
[200:46.86]Finish... At least... Okay, I'll finish... I'll at least finish the quest.
[200:51.00]That makes sense.
[200:55.36]Honestly, the reason why I had to stop doing that stupid routine is I actually had no fucking idea where I was going.
[201:00.74]I was like, okay, I can't see on the map, but I'm not going to go back to the... How would you even know where you were going?
[201:06.46]Alright, I'll finish this quest.
[201:16.72]And then I'm going to call it.
[201:17.98]And then I'll be live again... What's today?
[201:20.88]Sunday.
[201:21.20]How's Wednesday look?
[201:25.49]I think Wednesday's good.
[201:33.45]Same time, around 3 o'clock Pacific.
[201:40.58]Alright, get back up here, finish the quest, get my shit in here.
[201:48.24]Alright, before I get in, it's another cutscene.
[201:50.00]Whatever, it's cool.
[201:52.46]3pm Pacific, yep.
[201:53.66]On Wednesday.
[201:54.02]Okay.
[201:57.40]Thanks for watching though, appreciate it.
[202:07.54]Same game.
[202:09.42]Now that is a good question.
[202:12.19]I'm going to ask everybody here.
[202:17.19]Do you want?
[202:17.83]Let's get a poll.
[202:21.53]Do you want more Breath of the Wild on Wednesday?
[202:29.15]I'm going to need a very large amount of people saying yes.
[202:42.95]Saved Zora's domain.
[202:43.97]Okay.
[202:51.42]Link sincerely apologized for my harsh treatment of you.
[202:54.48]You were thinking higher rules and Lady Mipha's well-being just like the rest of us.
[203:02.10]Something else.
[203:02.56]Alright, you know what?
[203:04.06]I mean, this is 90% again, which is shocking.
[203:12.01]It seems like you don't like the game.
[203:13.75]What?
[203:16.57]I'm telling you right now, the amount... Okay, the percentage that is voting yes right now is at least what I feel about this game for a score.
[203:27.10]At the very least.
[203:28.44]I think this is great.
[203:30.74]I'm having a great time.
[203:36.14]I just want to make sure you guys are having a good time still.
[203:38.07]You know, I'm usually three stream Andy with a game besides Elden Ring.
[203:46.19]So.
[203:48.27]If you are still liking it, I'm still liking it.
[203:49.95]Let's keep doing it.
[203:51.05]Maybe I'll play some Splatoon on Wednesday.
[203:54.63]That sounds good, right?
[203:55.45]Maybe open up with some Splatoon, mess around for like an hour or two.
[204:04.24]Jump back into Breath of the Wild.
[204:09.72]Yeah, we'll do that.
[204:16.21]The switch is hooked up.
[204:17.35]It's ready.
[204:18.35]It's being captured.
[204:19.09]Okay, so there's a cool chest over here.
[204:25.53]By the way, Link, I see you are without your trusty blade, the sword that seals the darkness.
[204:30.87]Did you perhaps lose it when you lost your memory?
[204:34.23]Maybe.
[204:38.91]Yeah, so we'll do Splatoon 3 and Breath of the Wild again on Wednesday.
[204:43.05]Okay.
[204:57.46]As your father, I am proud of you for fighting the Divine Beast alongside Link.
[205:03.66]You've grown much recently.
[205:05.48]I know you'll be a worthy heir when your time comes.
[205:09.72]Father, thank you.
[205:11.71]The heavy rains have stopped, and the Divine Beast is our ally once again.
[205:14.47]Truly splendid.
[205:18.61]This is wonderful.
[205:19.23]Cool.
[205:19.45]Alright, what's in the chest?
[205:24.63]Mm-hmm.
[205:30.66]Mm-hmm.
[205:32.26]Top tier expression of gratitude.
[205:33.96]Alright.
[205:39.53]We're going to have a party?
[205:40.38]Alright.
[205:55.46]So what is in the chest?
[206:03.57]Light scale trident.
[206:12.35]Cool.
[206:12.47]Does this do anything cool?
[206:18.79]This can be repaired.
[206:19.79]It's a unique weapon and can repair.
[206:24.59]Save this weapon.
[206:25.51]Do not use it.
[206:26.21]Okay.
[206:29.50]I mean, I wasn't planning on it.
[206:30.76]All these ones, like this 60, this plus, plus, plus, plus.
[206:35.44]I'm going to hoard so many of these items.
[206:39.32]I'll use the default.
[206:42.39]Okay, cool.
[206:43.35]Alright, guys.
[206:44.09]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[206:45.33]Thanks for watching.
[206:51.88]Have a good rest of your night.
[206:54.72]I'm going to save it right here.
[206:55.90]This is exactly where we're going to open back up.
[207:09.14]What about the photo?
[207:10.18]Oh, we'll do that right when I get up.
[207:12.08]When I start again on Wednesday.
[207:26.03]It looks like all the last part of the stream of conscious charity is going on still.
[207:31.17]Yeah, I'll send you guys there.
[207:32.45]Sent you there last night too.
[207:33.29]I think it's Vinny's doing something right.
[207:40.39]Go say hello.
[207:40.89]Go support the charity stream, obviously.
[207:45.40]And I'll talk to you guys later.
[207:47.58]See you Wednesday.
[207:48.18]Take care of yourselves.
[207:48.92]Good night.
[207:49.36]Goodbye.
[207:51.22]See you later.
[208:10.20]I almost forgot.
[208:10.70]Yeah, call your mother.
[208:11.61]Come on.
[208:59.81]you
[209:34.69]you
[210:09.56]you
