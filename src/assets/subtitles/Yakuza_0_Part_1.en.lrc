[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.69]Hello?
[00:02.73]Hi, everybody.
[00:07.34]Oh, it's muted Marty.
[00:16.10]Muted Marty.
[00:19.08]No, I'm here.
[00:20.54]I'm ready to play a video game called Yakuza 0.
[00:25.01]And I'll give you a couple of quick things before we get started.
[00:27.77]The reason why I wasn't live yesterday is because I want to be completely transparent with everybody.
[00:33.07]I've started getting a little bit of cold symptoms.
[00:35.14]I have congestion in the nose.
[00:37.38]You probably hear it.
[00:38.90]Uh, so I've taken a little bit of time off just over the last couple of days.
[00:43.50]Started getting a little bit of symptoms on Saturday.
[00:45.20]Uh, I have taken a COVID test.
[00:48.11]So just kind of waiting to see what that says.
[00:50.73]I've been isolating.
[00:52.37]I haven't gone anywhere.
[00:53.11]I haven't done anything.
[00:53.79]Uh, so I'm just gonna, I'm taking precautions here to make sure that, you know, just in case.
[00:59.85]If I do, then I'll have to just kind of, I'll try to get through it.
[01:04.86]You know, I'll get through it.
[01:10.66]But I don't think that's what it is.
[01:13.76]Because I've seen, you know, how does COVID start?
[01:16.23]You know, it doesn't... It typically starts in the chest, but... Who knows?
[01:21.03]I'm just trying to be completely cautious.
[01:22.79]I don't... I want to be totally, totally, totally safe with this, right?
[01:33.80]Can you smell?
[01:34.56]Yes, I can.
[01:35.90]I can smell.
[01:36.36]I can taste.
[01:38.54]I just am stuffy and, uh, a little congested.
[01:42.38]And it's been like that for the last like probably four, three or four days.
[01:47.58]Hasn't really gone any further than that.
[01:48.70]Don't have a fever.
[01:53.64]We know you smell.
[01:58.49]You're a baby with a head cold.
[02:00.03]What?
[02:03.82]But I just want to be clear, if people are like hearing something in my voice and they're like, wait a minute, what the fuck is going on here, Jerma?
[02:10.87]I want you to know that I'm already kind of on top of it.
[02:13.57]So already on top of it.
[02:19.28]He's got a new mic.
[02:28.49]If you do have it, go into it with the mindset you'll get through it no matter what.
[02:31.43]Yeah, I've been taking vitamins too.
[02:34.62]I've been taking vitamin D. I've been drinking like some vitamin supplemental drinks.
[02:41.68]My immune system's pretty good.
[02:45.40]But we'll see, right?
[02:47.80]I'll know soon.
[02:52.91]What is vitamin 2?
[02:56.41]What?
[02:56.71]Did I say vitamin 2?
[03:00.79]I said vitamin D. I said vitamin 2?
[03:07.35]No, I didn't?
[03:10.53]yeah I'm taking precautions you know I'm taking vitamin two I don't know I don't did I do that well that's weird if I did anyways let's play Yakuza zero uh it's funny that the title of this stream is I promise I will not quit this game after three hours like I did last time I've played this before on stream a few years ago I stopped playing after three hours and now I mean I'm a little under the weather we'll see if I get to three hours we'll see what happens after three hours
[03:38.06]But I'll come back to it.
[03:39.54]No, I'm playing this for more than three hours.
[03:42.07]I promise.
[03:42.61]It's already in the title.
[03:43.41]It has to be there.
[03:56.44]And by the way, there was a bet in pre-stream chat too.
[03:58.74]Let me get this out.
[03:59.40]Hold on.
[04:01.70]It was a pre-stream bet that I won.
[04:06.33]It was, will I, uh, will I start the stream before 3 PM?
[04:11.38]And the answer is yes.
[04:16.48]If I didn't start before three, I was going to have to add a hundred billion dollars onto the debt.
[04:23.96]So I gave myself a lot of incentive.
[04:28.38]That's the audio for you guys.
[04:29.22]Can you hear it?
[04:29.62]Is it good?
[04:29.90]Maybe a little bit louder.
[04:36.62]Oh, did I make a tweet?
[04:37.52]No, I didn't.
[04:43.59]I didn't even make a tweet about this.
[04:44.61]How about, um... Yakuza guaranteed stream.
[04:56.27]No, I'm already playing it.
[04:57.21]How about just Yakuza... Here we go.
[05:00.66]Yakuza... I don't care.
[05:02.12]Yakuza.
[05:04.20]And people won't know which one, so they'll be like, Oh, I'm curious!
[05:07.62]Is he playing the new one?
[05:08.40]And they'll come in and inflate my view count.
[05:10.39]twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[05:17.67]That's my name, right?
[05:20.06]Yeah.
[05:20.18]Alright.
[05:23.94]I'm going to give this a real shot.
[05:25.74]Let's go.
[05:27.03]New game.
[05:36.81]I recommend it for players who are skilled at action games.
[05:39.59]But I don't care.
[05:42.87]No, not playing on hard.
[05:45.41]Not playing on hard.
[05:49.03]He's never going to finish this.
[05:50.23]Omega lul.
[05:51.45]Hey, I didn't say I was ever going to finish it.
[05:52.99]I said I was going to play it for more than three hours.
[05:57.02]Play hard for 10 million off.
[05:59.22]No, that's not enough.
[06:00.38]Normal.
[06:00.62]I don't care.
[06:07.37]You had an opportunity right there.
[06:08.39]That one guy was like, oh, if that was like 150 million, I would have done it.
[06:12.27]It was your opportunity.
[06:19.43]Okay, here's a fun experiment.
[06:20.63]Those of you that watch the other stream that have access to it, I think it's only the archive channel, right?
[06:25.62]Let's see how close this is to the other stream.
[06:31.62]Play them side by side.
[06:35.46]I'm going to make the same references.
[06:36.86]No, I'm going to try to make completely different references.
[06:39.94]Alright, what would I have said right here?
[06:49.82]Nice shoes, man.
[06:59.89]I'm trying to be different.
[07:03.60]You're trying hard now.
[07:05.08]Fuck, I'm gonna be trying so hard to make, like, things I wouldn't have made a reference to.
[07:08.88]To be different.
[07:22.38]That's when he said Chat Raid forced Mr. Sark to play Nancy Drew.
[07:28.64]Nice.
[07:29.26]Hahaha.
[07:37.89]uh and he did it that's great actually true and he did it that's awesome oh no you guys you guys now have a new drew crew streamer December 9 1988 in Tokyo
[08:13.52]What's this game about?
[08:14.26]Oh, the Yakuza.
[08:15.24]Right.
[08:16.30]No, Jeremy.
[08:16.90]It's about, like, growing up as a doctor.
[08:18.36]It's a dentist simulator.
[08:22.87]What are you doing?
[08:24.89]It hurts!
[08:44.78]Wait, do people recognize me?
[08:55.53]Oh, I've got... What did I say here?
[09:01.10]I said something here.
[09:01.60]I remember this.
[09:02.76]I think I said like, oh, sorry, I messily ate a hamburger or something, right?
[09:12.12]Oh, that was a really good double cheeseburger with extra ketchup.
[09:15.44]Run it back.
[09:15.82]Is that what I said?
[09:28.93]You said French fries?
[09:30.19]Alright, now stop telling me what I said.
[09:31.67]I'm gonna just be me.
[09:37.45]You said cheeseburger from Burger King.
[09:39.35]Fuck.
[09:54.38]Here's something that I didn't know.
[09:57.34]They drive on the other side of the road in Japan.
[10:05.79]I did not know that.
[10:07.85]Is the USA the only place that drives on the left side of the road?
[10:12.15]I mean, on the right side of the road.
[10:13.33]Wait, hold on.
[10:19.86]We're the only country on Earth that... I think there's one other country that does that, that drives on the right side.
[10:24.62]Parts of Africa do too?
[10:27.22]Less countries drive on the left.
[10:32.80]Hmm.
[10:48.64]Oh, at what point in this game do I go, DAME YO, DAME YO, DAME, DAME YO, SUKI RE, SUKI SUKI RE.
[11:01.68]Wait, when does that happen?
[11:02.90]Thank you very much.
[11:06.40]Heh, but if you make a fool out of me, it'll be a pain in the ass.
[11:15.41]That was in 30 minutes.
[11:17.83]I got a loan.
[11:18.51]I got a loan.
[11:19.11]I'm paying attention.
[11:19.87]Leave me alone.
[11:46.50]I saw the word loan and my character was on the screen.
[11:52.77]So I was like, I have loan.
[11:53.67]Alright, come work for me.
[11:56.73]Loan shark.
[11:57.59]A lot easier than that Yakuza payroll.
[11:59.97]Mm-hmm.
[12:20.65]By the way, I have to say, when have you ever stopped and looked over your right shoulder while you were talking to someone?
[12:33.08]I think they'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?
[12:38.24]Yeah.
[12:49.57]See you around.
[12:51.85]I think that would be kind of weird.
[12:53.05]You just have to tilt a few more degrees and you and I are talking normally.
[13:02.66]Ooh.
[13:19.57]Alright, here we go.
[13:20.20]I mean, well, I meant like here comes the music.
[13:39.73]Can you dance in this game?
[13:46.88]I swear to God, every TV movie and every show, every anime, no one ever smokes a cigarette.
[13:52.42]It's lit in their mouth, and that's it, and then you don't see it again.
[13:54.94]Okay, where's the cigarette?
[13:57.46]Where is it?
[14:00.14]He had it.
[14:00.84]It takes like 10 minutes to smoke a cigarette.
[14:02.34]Where is it?
[14:02.62]Let's see.
[14:10.27]Oh, no, he had a lit cigarette.
[14:12.53]The tip was lit.
[14:27.03]Oh, there we go.
[14:27.71]Right there.
[14:28.07]Tip.
[14:28.85]That's a full cigarette back there in the background.
[14:44.32]Smoking is hard to animate.
[14:48.26]Come on.
[14:48.52]Have a lit cigarette.
[14:49.24]Have a lit cigarette with just one puff out of it.
[14:51.88]Come on.
[14:57.35]You doing the same jokes?
[14:58.49]Is that the same one?
[15:00.37]No, it's not.
[15:00.85]Show me.
[15:02.07]That's not the same joke.
[15:02.91]Show me.
[15:03.57]Prove it.
[15:08.16]It can't be.
[15:18.81]No, it's not.
[15:23.24]This is where Nishiki said to meet me.
[15:26.58]I guess... Oh my god.
[15:29.88]Said he'd meet me.
[15:30.84]Guess I beat him here.
[15:31.91]724106, huh?
[15:36.39]That's code for what you're up to.
[15:38.71]I'm waiting for your slow ass to show up.
[15:41.96]Is this when like Twitch emotes become absolute language?
[15:51.58]May as well have a look around and see if I can find him.
[15:52.93]Okay, let's meet him.
[15:54.53]Find Nishikiyama.
[15:58.87]So, welcome.
[15:59.49]Oh, there's a save point.
[16:00.77]Can I save it?
[16:01.17]There's a big S. Oh.
[16:02.11]You can save the game and use the item box.
[16:20.72]A new save.
[16:21.82]Million yen vending machine.
[16:25.60]How much yen do I have?
[16:30.52]It's a dream machine.
[16:31.30]Insert a million yen to make your dreams come true.
[16:33.82]Maybe.
[16:34.16]I don't have enough money.
[16:38.44]I don't have that much.
[16:39.24]Oh, well, whatever.
[16:40.36]Is there a sprint?
[16:47.29]I'm going to take a second.
[16:48.35]I'm going to just take a quick second.
[16:52.40]Okay.
[16:52.60]Alright, let's go.
[16:55.66]Like, I'm already like running.
[16:59.68]While running.
[17:00.36]Is there a run button?
[17:01.94]Let's get in there.
[17:02.66]Somebody help me, please.
[17:19.76]Running shakedowns on our turf?
[17:21.16]Somebody needs to set them straight before they try anything really stupid.
[17:33.29]What do you want?
[17:34.01]This ain't a show.
[17:36.15]No, it's not.
[17:37.25]Wait, are you sure he's not Yakuza?
[17:42.31]So what if he is?
[17:43.28]He's our age.
[17:44.78]If he's Yakuza, he's probably just an errand boy.
[17:48.92]Wait, let me do this accurately.
[17:51.74]It'll be a lot lower than this.
[17:58.38]And what if we are?
[18:02.44]My family runs this part of Kamurocho.
[18:05.16]If you were regulars, you'd know better than to do anything stupid here.
[18:12.19]Excuse you?
[18:14.03]Where's a piece of Yakuza trash get off lecturing us?
[18:20.03]Yeah, that's more accurate.
[18:20.75]You can still kind of hear it a little bit.
[18:28.43]Alright, let's go.
[18:31.64]No music, huh?
[18:34.98]I remember the fighting in this game was really fun.
[18:36.38]It has a really good combat system, is what I remember.
[18:40.37]Holy shit, that guy just annihilated me.
[18:47.73]Press Y during an X combo to perform a finishing blow.
[18:51.83]No music?
[18:52.33]What are you talking about?
[18:53.53]Turn up the music.
[18:56.55]I turned down the music because it's loud.
[18:59.87]Please, we can't hear it.
[19:00.83]Hold on.
[19:04.43]Is it broken?
[19:05.01]Yeah, finishing blow knocks enemy down.
[19:08.37]The knockdown effect varies depending on the number of times X is pressed.
[19:12.50]What are you guys on about?
[19:13.32]Wait, are you mad because it sounds like it's coming through a wall?
[19:23.02]Oh shit, it is.
[19:23.72]It's like muffled coming through a wall.
[19:27.67]What the fuck is going on?
[19:30.87]What?
[19:35.37]This is insane.
[19:37.69]Why do they have a setting where it's like you're not at the party, but your neighbor is annoying?
[19:49.61]Okay.
[19:50.63]Alright, I get it.
[19:51.27]I get it.
[19:57.88]Does that just in the menu?
[19:59.01]Alright, here you go.
[20:01.17]There's your music.
[20:05.11]Just a finishing blow.
[20:06.83]One, two, three, four, five.
[20:10.69]One, two, three, four, five.
[20:16.97]The yellow gauge on the top of them is your health.
[20:19.41]The game will end if the yellow part is fully depleted, so keep an eye on your health at all times.
[20:23.23]Yep.
[20:24.43]If the gauge flashes red, it means you're in a very bad shape and you should replenish your health immediately.
[20:29.58]Use a health recovery snack.
[20:31.72]Or eat something.
[20:32.28]Yeah, okay.
[20:33.90]Press B to grab someone.
[20:35.22]If an enemy is guarding to block your attacks, grab them and then attack to deal damage.
[20:39.98]Hold on.
[20:44.53]This guy... Why is that guy... That guy has, like, rage mode.
[20:49.57]Come here.
[20:52.53]Just that one punch in the face.
[20:59.66]That's like WWF style.
[21:01.12]Like you're just letting me punch you in the face as hard as I can.
[21:06.87]I'm turning that down.
[21:07.45]It's a little loud.
[21:10.19]Your training is now complete.
[21:11.03]It's time to wipe the smirks off their faces.
[21:13.39]Let's go.
[21:19.61]Grab this guy.
[21:20.33]Punch him right down his throat.
[21:22.87]Grab this guy.
[21:23.47]Punch him right down his throat.
[21:25.75]It's a bug?
[21:27.27]Wait, what?
[21:31.57]It's an actual bug in the game?
[21:32.95]You need to put it in stereo.
[21:36.40]Wait, what is going on?
[21:45.24]Like that?
[21:54.96]OK, I did it.
[22:02.85]It's an in-game engine problem.
[22:04.71]Oh, well, it's alright.
[22:05.71]2900.
[22:06.17]Sounds worse.
[22:21.17]What is wrong with the audio?
[22:22.31]I'm trying to... Please put the volume in max.
[22:28.62]Restart the game?
[22:35.38]Well, let me save it first.
[22:36.50]Hold on.
[22:47.08]I like that suit.
[22:49.06]It's the Joker.
[22:49.81]It's not the Joker.
[23:17.69]Hey, this came out before the Joker did.
[23:20.58]The new movie.
[23:21.78]Joker's been around for 80 years.
[23:25.26]Yeah, but not the new movie that came out like a year ago.
[23:54.60]Hmm?
[23:54.98]Well, yeah.
[24:07.16]Should put Kazama-san's mind at rest.
[24:13.09]Don't know about that.
[24:13.91]But he always knew all I could do was fight.
[24:15.95]The other one was good at the dance.
[24:18.17]Different categories.
[24:20.79]Was it dancers?
[24:21.99]Fighters?
[24:22.35]Stop.
[24:23.49]I'm just reading.
[24:24.77]I can't read it?
[24:25.13]Why can't I read this?
[24:36.67]Do I just sit back in my chair and smoke my half-lit cigarette for four hours?
[24:40.35]$500,000? $500,000?
[25:02.49]Ashen?
[25:02.73]Cool.
[25:02.87]Oh, you fight this guy.
[25:04.31]Spoilers for the other stream I did.
[25:06.65]Come on, do it.
[25:30.57]Sign her jacket.
[25:31.25]It's a nice jacket.
[25:31.99]Cigarette's gone, by the way.
[25:35.71]Cigarette's gone.
[25:39.29]I win.
[26:00.31]He ate it.
[26:00.75]I like the way it burns when it goes down my throat.
[26:31.65]Okay, let's go.
[26:34.81]So, what do you guys want me to do?
[26:40.39]I always hate matching speed in games like this.
[26:42.43]Because you always just look like a weird guy that just can't keep up with his friend.
[26:46.42]Like, oh shit, sorry.
[26:47.30]I have to tilt this thing.
[26:49.56]Okay.
[26:59.10]The way these two are interacting, this is just like two drunk guys on the street.
[27:03.40]This is how they interact.
[27:05.18]Oh, sorry.
[27:05.72]Where do you want to go?
[27:07.38]What's still open?
[27:09.70]That place is open.
[27:11.14]I don't want to go there, though.
[27:13.12]That place sucks.
[27:13.84]But now we still have one more.
[27:15.97]We can just walk to the hotel.
[27:27.54]Right trigger.
[27:28.06]Whoopsie.
[27:38.11]Same joke.
[27:39.65]I can't wait to get three hours into this stream, so I cannot be told I'm doing the same shit.
[27:45.24]We will cross that threshold, and I can't possibly do the same thing.
[27:59.73]we only have three hours of material no alright let's go let's do it let's have some fun
[28:24.96]You got a Trojan condom ad?
[28:26.42]Aren't there targeted ads?
[28:29.12]So, I don't know what you're doing.
[28:31.73]Max out the in-game volume?
[28:34.61]Okay, I will.
[28:35.55]Alright, it's a fight.
[28:55.15]Oh, this is two drunk guys.
[28:56.64]Oh, I remember this.
[28:57.80]Yep.
[28:58.70]Okay, avoid.
[28:59.52]Exact same thing.
[29:07.00]Hey, old man.
[29:09.26]Quit talking to those.
[29:10.55]We're not done here.
[29:13.63]Who's an old man?
[29:14.53]You snot-nosed little punk.
[29:16.79]Who's a snot?
[29:17.53]Whatever you said.
[29:20.03]Oh, shit.
[29:20.35]He just did the fucking Pac-Man technique.
[29:24.20]Now you've done it.
[29:34.20]Screw it.
[29:34.71]They're completely wasted.
[29:35.51]It's not worth the trouble.
[29:36.31]Let's take a different road.
[29:38.31]I got a faster way to fix this.
[29:40.51]Oh, yeah.
[29:41.35]I just need to sober them up a bit with my fists.
[29:51.34]Again, I can't tell if you're a sadist or a charity worker.
[30:01.62]No, you sweep the leg, give him a blanket.
[30:04.32]Sweep the leg, give him a blanket.
[30:06.40]And put him in a safe place.
[30:21.25]Brunkards.
[30:22.81]Alright, heat gauge.
[30:25.22]Three blue glowing bars on the top left are called the Heat Gauge.
[30:28.34]The Heat Gauge starts at first bar, and as your attacks hit enemies, the gauge fills up, shifting to the second and then third bar.
[30:35.59]At each level, your speed increases some moves and requires a certain level of heat, so once you are used to fighting, keep an eye on your heat level.
[30:44.28]Once the heat gauge shifts to the second or third bar, Kiryu's body begins to glow with a blue aura.
[30:48.75]This is called heat mode, and it signals that you can use a special heat action.
[30:53.33]Try using heat actions while sobering up the drunkards.
[30:55.91]What's this?
[31:00.91]It's CBD pen on stream for 500 million off the debt.
[31:03.49]I don't smoke.
[31:04.15]I don't smoke.
[31:04.95]No, that's impossible.
[31:09.79]I don't have a CBD pen, okay?
[31:15.93]Alright, press B with the heat gauge at the second or third bar to grab enemies.
[31:19.47]And then press Y. It's a super punch.
[31:26.24]That hurts you too.
[31:29.02]That guy won.
[31:32.08]How much heat does this guy have?
[31:42.05]Okay, your training is now complete.
[31:43.13]That concludes the explanation of the heat gauge.
[31:45.79]And special moves.
[31:46.61]But the two drunkards still need some sobriety beaten into them.
[31:50.27]If you take a fighting stance using RB, movement with the left stick will center around the enemy in front of you.
[31:55.92]This is very effective when you want to focus your attacks on a single enemy.
[32:00.14]Like this guy.
[32:06.83]Use RB and... RB...
[32:12.42]To lock... RB to lock onto an enemy.
[32:19.53]Why do that when you can just do that?
[32:35.20]Right bumper... Wait, I think I changed it, didn't I?
[32:52.60]losing to the drunk guys now I have too much health to lose to the drunk guys it's impossible deal update no I'm not taking any drugs right now okay I'm sorry it's not drug related it better not be if it is I'm if this is drug related I'm taking 100 million off the debt
[33:21.09]Okay, new deal.
[33:21.81]All money collected in Yakuza by the end of the stream will go towards paying off the debt.
[33:26.57]Notice, Yen to USD conversion will apply.
[33:28.99]All money collected?
[33:33.59]Alright.
[33:36.60]That sounds pretty good.
[33:44.52]So all money collected are all money that I have in my bank account by the end of the stream.
[33:52.68]Wait, with conversion, wouldn't that... Okay.
[33:59.84]Collected.
[34:00.84]End of the game.
[34:01.50]Whatever.
[34:05.28]Okay, Mr. Hero, I'll walk you to the train.
[34:06.76]Take it slow.
[34:08.87]Oof.
[34:09.65]Thanks.
[34:09.97]You're awful considerate for a kid your age.
[34:16.71]All's well that ends well.
[34:21.93]One USD is a hundred yen.
[34:23.22]Okay.
[34:25.48]Completing certain challenges were on your CP completion points.
[34:28.82]You can view them for the pause menu under completion list.
[34:31.75]Some of the, some of the things, some are things that will probably happen on their own as you play the game, but others, yeah.
[34:36.91]Alright.
[34:39.05]Exchanging CP.
[34:39.91]Visit temples or shrines to access the CP exchange menu where you can spend CP to earn special blessings ranging from being able to sprint for longer distances or to earning more cash from fights.
[34:52.10]Okay, cool.
[35:00.58]What a waste.
[35:01.10]A damn shame, I say.
[35:02.00]Hmm?
[35:07.40]So, just out of curiosity, it's been, like, this game is kind of a slow start.
[35:13.39]It's been 40 minutes, and I've kind of barely just started doing stuff.
[35:17.29]How did I play this game for, like, three hours and stop?
[35:19.55]I don't understand.
[35:23.69]What did I say?
[35:24.91]Why did I say, oh, I'm done?
[35:27.17]Is it because I was just super, like, ADHD and I couldn't even handle it?
[35:37.59]Oh, okay.
[35:41.95]You want to talk alcohol?
[35:42.91]You're like taking one swig from a vintage bottle and tossing the rest.
[35:48.95]Going from the look of you, you're Japanese Mafia.
[35:51.60]Yeah?
[35:53.78]Something like that.
[35:55.56]Yes.
[35:58.20]Seems like you're pretty confident in a fight.
[35:59.50]A real dynamite boy.
[36:02.60]Calling me boy.
[36:04.70]Don't get ruffled now, kid.
[36:05.65]Compared to me, you're practically a toddler.
[36:08.92]Hey, cure you.
[36:09.96]What's the hold up, man?
[36:12.18]It's nothing.
[36:12.64]Be right there.
[36:14.29]No sense wasting time with this drunk.
[36:15.51]I should just go.
[36:17.71]Too much booze is bad for you, Gramps.
[36:19.09]Take care.
[36:19.55]Hey, now hold up.
[36:22.61]Wait.
[36:23.37]I got one piece of advice for you.
[36:25.57]And I've got a friend waiting for me.
[36:27.49]If you got something to say, make it quick.
[36:30.24]Oh!
[36:31.48]Out for a night with your main dog?
[36:33.40]Me and the boys used to really wreck it back when I was your age.
[36:37.16]But if you spend all your money playing around, you'll never get stronger.
[36:40.69]You gotta invest in yourself.
[36:43.15]What?
[36:43.87]Like a gym membership?
[36:45.69]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:46.77]That's no better than spending it on booze.
[36:48.81]I'm talking about investing in yourself literally.
[36:52.15]Literally?
[36:52.53]What's that even mean?
[36:55.14]Glad you asked, my boy.
[36:57.10]Here's a special lecture just for you.
[37:02.20]Upgrades are now available.
[37:04.56]Cool.
[37:06.43]Just like Path of Exile.
[37:09.53]I have 232,000 yen.
[37:10.63]So what do I do first?
[37:16.44]Throw your entire body behind a vicious kick.
[37:20.14]Cool.
[37:23.64]Max health.
[37:26.08]Heat gauge will slowly rise over time when you are wounded.
[37:28.58]However, it will only fill up to the second bar.
[37:32.50]Okay.
[37:32.70]Okay.
[37:36.21]Two million.
[37:44.58]Why is it yen?
[37:45.40]What?
[37:46.92]Oh.
[37:51.60]Sack.
[37:52.62]Okay, so the heat gauge just slowly rises when I'm taking, when I'm hurt.
[37:55.82]Cool.
[37:59.83]Three sack.
[38:01.59]Sack.
[38:03.89]Hey, spend money to make money.
[38:05.06]That's right.
[38:05.44]You gotta spend money to make money.
[38:06.58]$200,000?
[38:08.66]Ooh, I'm considered a brawler.
[38:15.66]You keep pouring money into yourself with a little training.
[38:17.80]That talent of yours will grow in no time.
[38:20.40]So keep the women and wine on a budget, you hear?
[38:23.87]Investing in myself.
[38:25.03]Literally.
[38:26.33]Never thought of that.
[38:28.79]Bet you're glad you stopped and listened now, aren't you?
[38:31.55]Yeah, I guess I am.
[38:34.12]Yo, Kiryu.
[38:35.55]I'm coming.
[38:36.93]All that serious talk killed my buzz.
[38:39.03]Time for round two.
[38:40.35]You have a good night, my boy.
[38:45.83]Is Blackjack in this game?
[38:50.05]Whatever.
[38:50.31]I don't care anymore.
[38:53.95]What a weird old man.
[38:54.85]What's his deal?
[38:55.43]A nice Irish-Japanese guy.
[39:03.64]What?
[39:12.42]Well, it said Foreigner, didn't it?
[39:14.14]Oh yeah, it did say Foreigner, yeah.
[39:24.37]Akas isn't Japanese.
[39:27.41]No, he's the God of Wine.
[39:41.85]Bacchus is Greek, yeah.
[39:51.07]I know my Greek gods.
[39:52.11]I know when I hover over him in spite and I select him, he goes, BACCHUS!
[39:56.35]I know his name.
[39:57.05]He's a big fat guy and he has a big turkey leg.
[39:59.07]It's Roman.
[40:11.00]Hi, guys.
[40:17.74]College girl slash hostess.
[40:23.57]Madoka-chan and Yui-chan.
[40:26.43]Hey, one-dimensional gamer.
[40:28.25]Thanks for the den.
[40:28.79]Give it a big subs.
[40:30.75]Thanks a lot.
[40:38.46]Well, I want to.
[40:40.00]Don't be like that.
[40:40.64]Here, pick a card.
[40:42.69]Any card.
[40:42.93]Oh, it's money.
[40:45.87]I thought I was doing like a cool magic trick.
[41:07.10]Why don't you get so popular with the ladies?
[41:21.81]Wait, don't tell me you think I just let those two play me for 40 grand!
[41:28.42]Oh, wait, it's... Hold on.
[41:30.46]Who's this...
[41:39.30]Okay, if you gave 40 grand to just two random girls that were like, hey, maybe it's at the club.
[41:44.20]I think you kind of did.
[41:44.84]What, you think I just gave two people $40,000 just to have fun?
[41:48.32]Whatever.
[41:48.60]I know it's 400, but if it wasn't...
[42:07.42]This dude's rich as fuck.
[42:12.82]God, remember when they used to have the two slots in the front for the audio video cables?
[42:26.37]And it would trail all the way to where your console was and someone would just trip over it and rip the fucking cables out and just ruin your Super Mario session.
[42:34.59]It would be like, Dad.
[42:38.91]He would trip and it'd be like, he'd get caught up and go, God damn it.
[42:42.21]I see.
[42:42.39]You're great.
[43:02.61]Alright, this is completely unrelated somehow, but it just made me think.
[43:12.02]One of my friends rented Rugrats from Blockbuster one time, and he hated it so much.
[43:19.80]It was such a shitty game that he threw it down his stairs and destroyed it, and they had to, like, pay for it for Blockbuster.
[43:34.72]How old was he?
[43:35.22]I don't know, like 12?
[43:36.26]The search for Reptar sucks.
[44:06.23]I remember he had a really like long staircase like a very long straight down stairwell so it this thing just sunk into the well it was just like well
[44:30.85]It was like a CD, right?
[44:32.29]Yeah, it was on PlayStation 1.
[44:33.51]Maybe it was N64.
[44:38.18]It was one of the two.
[44:38.86]Rugrats was PS1?
[44:39.44]Yeah.
[44:39.62]I scratched up.
[44:41.56]It didn't work anymore.
[45:07.56]Karaoke is a rhythm game where you press buttons shown on the screen with the song.
[45:11.10]Yeah.
[45:14.48]Make sure to press the correct ones at the right time.
[45:16.28]Mm-hmm.
[45:18.03]When someone else sings, you can support them with interjections.
[45:21.11]Remember this.
[45:22.61]You can choose simple or lively interjections.
[45:26.95]Okay.
[45:29.07]Sing along, tambourine, maracas.
[45:30.81]I remember this.
[45:31.27]Yep, I do.
[45:34.33]Yeah, let's go.
[45:39.26]Oh wait, I have to fix the audio, don't I?
[45:42.53]Judgment.
[45:44.13]We're gonna sing Judgment.
[45:45.17]Hold on, let me turn it up.
[45:58.98]Is this a meme song?
[46:00.16]Oh my god, what is this?
[46:10.75]Fuck, it's not... I'm sorry.
[46:13.58]What?
[46:17.32]I don't know the controls.
[46:19.02]I don't know the buttons.
[46:20.18]I swear to God.
[46:21.34]I have to look down at it sometimes.
[46:22.38]I don't... Xbox and shit.
[46:25.04]I'm serious.
[46:29.73]I memorize PlayStation, not Xbox.
[46:35.95]What?
[46:37.55]What?
[46:49.32]Is there anything else that happened to anybody else?
[46:50.88]Oh, I could kill that.
[46:55.62]Hold on.
[47:20.63]I got so into that part I couldn't sing the rest of it nice nice nice nice yeah x on Xbox versus x on um PlayStation it just messes up my brain
[47:44.35]So I have, in my mind, have burned the PlayStation controller into my brain.
[47:49.45]So if I see X pop up on Xbox, it's like, oh no, wrong.
[48:03.24]I got 87, that's fine.
[48:10.15]Entertain yourself 10 times.
[48:15.12]Just burn your Xbox brain.
[48:17.84]You want to burn my brain?
[48:43.10]Let me try to do that fix that people are saying.
[48:52.71]I can plant it in that drink.
[48:53.91]I'm not that hungry.
[49:12.54]Do English.
[49:21.68]If I change from Japanese to English at this point, I'm going to be attacked.
[49:27.91]Alright, let me see if I can get this right.
[49:32.57]So you guys were saying turn the background volume all the way up.
[49:42.78]Okay.
[49:45.46]And then... Does that fix it?
[49:51.87]It's still kind of loud.
[49:54.19]Turn the master all the way up.
[49:58.03]Turn them both all the way up.
[50:04.40]What the fuck?
[50:05.24]Why is there like a waterfall?
[50:11.89]Now this is wicked loud.
[50:17.07]Oh, okay.
[50:18.63]Turn it down in the mixer.
[50:20.83]Okay.
[50:21.03]So I'm turning it down in the mixer.
[50:39.19]And that should be good.
[50:40.19]Get off me!
[50:40.57]Why do I sound like we're at a water park?
[50:42.49]This is just the sounds you hear when you're standing in the line.
[51:07.10]get off me to quit doing that like naruto move where he like splits into two people
[51:40.69]Why can't you have normal audio?
[51:42.45]I didn't do anything.
[51:43.22]What did I do wrong?
[51:44.06]I didn't do anything wrong.
[51:45.50]I'm sorry.
[51:46.18]I turned the volume down and everybody got mad at me.
[51:53.02]A lot of the young males found severely beaten in the quiet corner of Kamurocho.
[52:11.41]We've just received a report.
[52:13.71]The body of the victim's mother has been found.
[52:15.47]Yes.
[52:15.65]The man found dead is Kurihara Taichi, a company employee living in the city, 32 years old.
[52:21.78]According to the police, Kurihara-san was caught smoking from a few financial companies and is expected to ask the relevant person about the situation.
[52:30.50]Hey, Kiryu.
[52:31.86]Hm?
[52:32.06]He was killed in Kamurocho?
[52:45.52]Just a couple of cigarettes.
[52:47.42]Freshly lit.
[52:48.24]I thought he was holding a cigarette too.
[52:55.01]For a second.
[52:55.97]I don't know why.
[53:11.34]Oh, shit.
[53:11.70]That's the guy.
[53:12.12]That's the guy from the beginning.
[53:15.15]Yup.
[53:41.72]Why'd you do that?
[54:00.80]There's too many lit cigarettes in here.
[54:02.48]The fire alarm's going off.
[54:04.02]Fellas, can you put them down?
[54:06.64]And like 30 people in the restaurant look over with the lit cigarettes like, Oh, yeah, us?
[54:11.54]Oh, sorry.
[54:16.45]I'm going to call the office.
[54:17.37]I knew it.
[54:19.05]You were called out because of the news.
[54:22.05]You... You're in trouble now.
[54:28.11]No, of course you're in trouble, but Kazama's boss is going to be in trouble too.
[54:35.21]What?
[54:37.03]He's going to get caught up in this.
[54:39.11]What do you mean?
[54:41.29]Everyone in Dojima knows that you and I were caught by the boss.
[54:45.25]That's why our Fushimatsu will be the boss's responsibility.
[54:48.19]But...
[54:58.29]oh murder I'm doing the thing where somebody that you're watching a movie with has their eyes down on their phone almost the whole time and they just say oh
[55:22.00]What?
[55:23.28]Because they're humoring you?
[55:25.08]Because you're the one that picked the movie?
[55:27.30]And they murdered him!
[55:28.38]Murder?
[55:28.56]What the fuck, dude?
[55:29.04]I'm just texting my mom home.
[55:48.93]How did I not make it three hours?
[55:50.05]I must have just so badly wanted to leave the game last time.
[55:53.63]Why?
[55:53.71]Sorry.
[56:24.72]Because Ubisoft games are bad?
[56:26.16]Isn't this a SEGA game?
[56:28.94]This isn't Ubisoft.
[56:36.55]Alright, we gotta call Dojima Family HQ.
[56:38.21]There should be a payphone.
[56:40.69]Find a payphone!
[56:51.06]Save.
[56:52.14]Save it.
[56:54.90]Is this... Is it in the trash?
[56:59.14]Where's the save... What?
[57:01.42]Oh.
[57:08.12]Bro, I... Look, I'm just looking at the mini-map.
[57:13.94]A Twitch actor.
[57:16.03]And the nominees for best Twitch actor of the year.
[57:19.63]Jerma985.
[57:21.60]Where's the payphone?
[57:22.80]Oh, my God.
[57:23.20]What is it?
[57:23.48]The trash?
[57:24.32]And I'm just sitting in the audience, just like, I'm in a full, like, three-piece suit.
[57:32.35]Okay.
[57:50.34]I'm like clasping hands with the person next to me.
[57:53.88]My eyes closed.
[57:55.14]And the winner for best pretender on Twitch.
[57:57.82]And somebody else.
[58:04.11]And my eyes open.
[58:07.93]It was supposed to be me.
[58:14.25]What was your acceptance speech, Vee?
[58:17.60]Yeah, okay, my acceptance speech to win that award, I would go up there.
[58:21.36]And I'd be like, I would start walking down the aisle.
[58:26.12]And I would trip.
[58:27.40]Oh, but it was a joke.
[58:28.12]I was pretending.
[58:28.94]Oh, and I would just swipe my head when I got up.
[58:31.24]Like, oh, phew.
[58:33.16]Everyone would laugh their asses off.
[58:45.71]You do the Willy Wonka.
[58:46.81]Yeah.
[58:51.59]I would look around.
[58:52.65]I'd be like, where's the podium?
[58:54.86]I'd put my hand up like I'm looking out over yonder on a sailing boat.
[59:00.32]I don't see the podium.
[59:01.16]And everyone's pointing like, it's up there.
[59:04.00]Oh, he's lying to Pretender.
[59:05.62]He's doing it.
[59:06.50]And I'm like, I can't see it.
[59:07.98]Where is it?
[59:08.98]Oh, there it is.
[59:09.88]I spin around like five times.
[59:25.29]pantomime the speech.
[59:26.23]I'd get up there and pretend the mic didn't work.
[59:28.23]I'd be like just moving my mouth and no words.
[59:31.63]I wouldn't be saying anything.
[59:37.08]Get out of the way. $470.
[59:53.16]It's just a real life children's... No, that's a clown.
[59:56.30]That's a mime.
[59:57.96]I'd be a mime without the makeup on.
[59:59.94]That'd be so stupid.
[60:18.89]You're always a clown without the makeup on, silly.
[60:24.61]God, if I... I sometimes... I wish I just could turn the webcam on right now and just start going nuts making a balloon animal.
[60:30.63]Oh, I'll get that ready one day.
[60:52.39]Oh, that's the guy.
[60:53.01]I fight that guy.
[61:05.15]Spoilers, you probably fight everybody in this room over the course of a 12 hour campaign.
[61:13.52]This is a 70 hour game.
[61:29.75]Oh.
[61:31.37]Closer to 80?
[61:56.28]I feel like when you catch yourself sitting like that, you go, oh fuck, and you sit up straight.
[62:01.28]Like you go, oh my god, how am I, I'm sitting so... ...
[62:27.78]I feel like I posed these guys in Gmod to take a thumbnail picture.
[62:30.98]I feel like I posed these guys in Gmod to take a thumbnail picture.
[62:56.06]How do we do that?
[62:57.50]We simply kill the Batman.
[63:30.27]Come on.
[63:31.73]No.
[63:32.33]I just said it.
[63:32.99]I just said it for fun.
[63:33.85]I wasn't trying to be, like, funny.
[63:35.23]I just, like, had to say it.
[63:36.15]Hey, Geryu.
[63:37.42]Why did you do it in that place?
[63:42.78]Huh?
[63:42.96]I don't think it's Kazama's master's order.
[63:49.50]Master's order?
[63:54.87]Why is Master's name coming out?
[64:02.90]Oh, that hurt my head.
[64:03.70]I probably hurt his leg.
[64:06.27]That sounded like it really fucking hurt.
[64:08.19]That was right in the middle of the shin bone.
[64:11.27]No.
[64:11.35]No, same joke.
[64:11.95]No.
[64:12.03]No.
[64:32.57]just wait till I get over three hours and I could just get a new goddamn material how am I supposed to it was like three and a half years ago even longer it was like four years ago
[65:02.16]You should have replayed the original stream.
[65:05.40]Oh, that would have been actually very good idea.
[65:30.05]Just see if you guys figure it out.
[65:31.35]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[65:33.75]No, no, no, no.
[65:35.75]Wait, hold on a second.
[65:36.57]I'm going to play the VOD from this point.
[65:38.81]Let's see what happens.
[65:39.64]Everybody hold on a sec.
[66:02.51]You ready for this shit?
[66:04.63]We're gonna have a little bit of fun.
[66:07.93]I'm gonna play it from this exact moment.
[66:13.21]One sec.
[66:15.71]No.
[66:17.60]Alright, how far did I get?
[66:22.60]Did I do things in a different order?
[66:28.28]Try to take me up.
[66:30.75]Okay, the part, so... Alright.
[66:36.25]Did that happen yet?
[66:36.83]Did this part happen yet?
[66:37.59]I gotta get the right spot.
[67:03.44]Okay.
[67:05.49]So right when that cutscene ends... I don't want to see any of the jokes.
[67:09.21]I want to see if I do it the same way.
[67:13.31]Come on, give me it.
[67:17.63]Alright, here it is.

[68:45.65]Whatever the next cutscene is, I think I'm gonna have to skip it.
[68:49.71]Alright, we're in an in-game cutscene.
[68:50.80]That might be it.
[68:51.32]Okay, here we go.
[68:54.12]And... It's gonna be like... Here.
[68:55.66]Alright.

[69:02.03]I gotta get this in the right spot.
[69:13.87]Okay.
[69:24.56]So remember, it's like right when the camera pans and we go.
[69:40.03]Wrong cutscene.
[69:40.87]No, it's not.
[69:48.99]Oh, sick cigarette.
[69:51.35]He took at least a third of that off with that haul.
[70:03.32]By the way, I should probably mute this audio from me so I don't hear what I'm saying.
[70:12.73]Keep it.
[70:13.39]Alright, fine.
[70:14.17]Oh, Jerm is spawning?

[72:06.16]I don't know what my reactions were four years ago.
[72:10.81]Yeah, what a psycho.
[72:17.61]What an egomaniac.
[72:28.25]Like, dude, the movie's on the screen right now, man.

[77:30.89]Really angry people.
[77:31.91]Time to fight.
[77:34.44]I got to go faster than them.
[77:36.48]Is this the same two guys, three guys that were in the alleyway before?
[77:41.98]Yeah, you mentioned you've been looking for me.
[77:44.49]Actually, wait.

[77:58.94]I'm just going to beat them up and he's going to teach me something.
[78:03.72]I don't know which one's even real.
[78:05.06]This hurts my head.
[78:05.98]I can't look at this.
[78:07.30]You think he'd beat you?
[78:08.30]No, I don't know.
[78:09.00]That's a great question, Ashton.
[78:09.96]They're real eager to talk to you.
[78:11.84]Don't bait the streamer into doing something stupid that he doesn't want to do.
[78:15.46]Oh, hey, speak of the devil.
[78:17.00]Here they are now.
[78:18.08]Okay.
[78:19.93]Alright, Gramps.
[78:20.83]Is this the kid?
[78:22.71]Yes, sir.
[78:23.33]My prized pupil.
[78:25.04]Sorry, pupil?
[78:27.62]The million yen loan that I get those two deadbeats is way past due.
[78:31.16]I need it back.
[78:31.66]I ain't waiting much longer.
[78:35.20]Tell me about it.
[78:35.74]Wait.
[78:37.26]Why tell me about it?
[78:38.01]Wait.
[78:38.57]Expect me to tell you?
[78:40.27]I can't even talk.
[78:41.81]I can't even talk.
[78:42.53]I have to lower it.
[78:43.93]It's making me want to throw up.
[78:47.67]There.
[78:48.17]That's better.
[78:48.49]Come on.
[78:50.29]Come on.
[78:50.71]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[78:52.33]Alright, sure.
[78:55.35]Wait, he's ahead of me, he's ahead of me.
[78:56.79]This guy's definitely like a master blocker.
[78:58.77]No, no, no, no, go, go, go, he's way ahead of me.
[79:01.43]I don't think it's a fight.
[79:03.01]Okay, alright, pay the money, wise choice.
[79:06.25]You wanna pay me double, I gotta beat him.
[79:08.15]No, alright, let's go, fight me, you bastards.
[79:11.01]Teach this whippersnapper how to fight.
[79:13.63]He'll be fine, just a little workout.
[79:15.71]And fight.
[79:19.55]Alright, I gotta kick the shit out of this guy right now.
[79:21.13]Is that me just daydreaming about how I wish I could do that?
[79:29.96]I can't skip the cutscene.
[79:35.86]That was so much funnier.
[79:37.54]Okay, wait, it's my turn.
[79:40.70]That's a great Smash intro.
[79:42.92]That's a great, like, I just won Smash Bros.
[79:45.22]against, like, four friends.
[79:50.60]I did say this was going to be a movie in the very beginning.
[79:53.28]I tried to warn you guys.
[79:54.26]Okay, here we go.
[79:56.05]I heard the word murder parade.
[80:02.87]He's fine.
[80:03.21]Told you.
[80:04.07]Big guy.
[80:04.45]Didn't punch him.
[80:06.21]Go, go, go.
[80:08.59]That's the same joke, but worse?
[80:10.65]No, it's not.
[80:13.35]It's better.
[80:15.11]Okay, I meant when I said it wouldn't... You already saw the video.
[80:17.29]He said it.
[80:17.59]Alright, then.
[80:19.07]Round two.
[80:20.19]I know how to play already.
[80:20.89]I'm going to kick it.
[80:21.51]Okay, I'm almost ahead.
[80:22.01]I'm almost ahead.
[80:22.41]I'm almost ahead.
[80:22.81]It's free thugs.
[80:25.28]Let's go.
[80:26.76]You can switch to rush style by pressing... I don't care.
[80:28.74]I'm just going to get ahead of him.
[80:31.82]Old Jerma was terrible at video games.
[80:33.60]Actually, he's way better.
[80:34.88]You can evade.
[80:38.32]Yep.
[80:38.54]Alright, evade nine times.
[80:42.08]How many times has he evaded?
[80:43.24]He's so ahead of me.
[80:45.52]I like this mode.
[80:47.54]Oh.
[80:47.74]Come on!
[81:02.22]Alright.
[81:03.68]Use rush dial moves to crush Bruno and show him who's boss.
[81:06.62]When using the rush dial, you can stun enemies by hitting them a certain number of times.
[81:09.98]Attacks on stunned enemies will knock them down without fail.
[81:13.00]Alright, let's go.
[81:24.75]Old Jerma pog.
[81:25.67]No, don't say that.
[81:26.69]Old Jerma sucks.
[81:28.11]New Jerma.
[81:28.77]New Vegas art.
[81:44.72]I think I beat him.
[81:45.82]Wait, how much health?
[81:46.54]I'm beating him.
[81:47.00]I'm winning.
[81:48.34]He hit me with every move.
[81:57.62]Come on.
[81:58.30]I gotta dodge.
[81:59.03]I'm not dodging.
[82:03.95]Come on, please.
[82:05.89]Alright, give me a little bit of slack.
[82:07.31]I'm hearing myself fucking talking.
[82:09.01]I'm hearing the audio twice.
[82:10.53]Usually it's in circle, right?
[82:11.65]But it's a big thing.
[82:16.99]Alright, we're good.
[82:22.56]We're good.
[82:23.10]Are we done with the tutorial?
[82:25.06]What?
[82:26.28]How much longer is the tutorial?
[82:27.26]No.
[82:27.94]Yeah, we already were, right?
[82:29.55]What family are you guys from?
[82:31.90]Name's Kiryu.
[82:32.74]Dojima family.
[82:33.88]What family are you guys with?
[82:35.28]Well, there's no coincidence.
[82:36.40]I have business with your boss.
[82:38.28]I need to meet him.
[82:38.80]Fuck he did.
[82:39.18]I gotta pull that out.
[82:39.97]I see.
[82:40.29]That's in a building on Taihei Boulevard East.
[82:42.53]Right?
[82:42.79]I'll pay him a visit then.
[83:01.84]Another hour of this.
[83:05.45]The real fun stuff.
[83:06.27]Whoa, I can't wait to have a ton of fucking fun on Thursday.
[83:12.11]I can't.
[83:12.63]I can't.
[83:13.05]It's hurting me.
[83:13.53]This guy's name is Bacchus.
[83:24.10]I'm sorry, guys.
[83:25.62]I just skipped a little bit.
[83:31.35]This guy can teach me a lot about fighting.
[83:33.73]Okay.
[83:35.07]In the parking lot.
[83:35.81]Okay, so this guy's in the parking lot.
[83:41.34]This guy hangs out and just drinks and like levels you up.
[83:44.80]And there's a guy at a bank.
[83:48.70]Okay, like I know this is gonna be fun.
[83:51.89]I can't wait.
[83:56.50]This guy wants me to box for a living and, like, he wants to make money on me.
[83:59.53]It's fine.
[84:00.57]Hello?
[84:00.79]Can you guys hear me?
[84:03.29]Anybody hear me?
[84:05.25]I'm, like, fading out of it.
[84:06.39]I feel weird.
[84:08.23]What's fucking happening?
[84:09.27]Okay.
[84:10.47]Okay.
[84:10.86]So, I gotta go to the bank.
[84:13.80]No.
[84:15.64]No, no.
[84:16.16]I'm fading.
[84:17.26]I'm... Oh, fuck.
[84:18.62]What an idiotic thing to do.
[84:19.92]I went back in time.
[84:21.89]And I fuck with the timelines.
[84:23.11]I'm trying to replace myself?
[84:24.71]No, this is weird.
[84:25.89]I feel like I'm drunk.
[84:26.95]What the fuck?
[84:27.85]Why can't I go in here?
[84:29.29]No, I'm... What?
[84:31.25]I taste like metal.
[84:32.85]Get out of my way.
[84:35.02]Anybody hear me?
[84:41.84]Okay, let's just do this, get this out of the way.
[84:44.94]No, I have to stop and catch my- I can run more than this guy.
[84:48.16]How sad is that?
[84:48.86]This guy's like a mastermind Yakuza assassin.
[84:52.08]He can sprint down an alley, and then he has to catch his breath.
[84:55.85]I can run, like, a mile like that.
[84:59.97]I could run a full sprint mile.
[85:01.61]This guy can't even do it around a fucking corner.
[85:07.99]Get ready first.
[85:08.77]No, go in the building.
[85:09.65]Like, what do you mean go get ready?
[85:15.68]I want to get through this as fast as possible.
[85:18.68]I'm ready.
[85:20.46]Oh, maybe I wasn't ready.
[85:21.50]These guys all have like weapons.
[85:26.21]What are you doing here, punk?
[85:32.76]It's like the same guy.
[85:33.66]Okay, no interest in speaking with me.
[85:35.78]That's fine.
[85:36.86]I'll just have to.
[85:37.66]Okay, this is the first test.
[85:39.62]This is the first test of real raw gameplay.
[85:42.48]Time to go.
[85:58.96]That was fun.
[85:59.32]Where am I?
[86:29.83]I better get moving.
[86:30.45]Come on, Bruno.
[86:31.21]Pick it up.
[86:31.57]Pick it... Wait.
[86:36.26]I saw... I just saw the birth of Jesus.
[86:39.10]And then... It's leaving.
[86:41.90]It's leaving.
[86:42.20]I saw all the dinosaurs die.
[86:43.36]It's leaving.
[86:43.72]It's leaving.
[86:44.04]It's leaving.
[86:44.32]It's leaving.
[86:45.26]No, no, no, no.
[86:45.80]They were swimming.
[86:46.43]What?
[86:46.67]No, no, no, no.
[86:47.21]It's gone.
[86:47.45]It's gone.
[86:47.75]What's happening?
[86:49.31]I... Um... Hey, tell me something.
[86:56.39]Hello?
[86:56.59]Hello?
[86:57.95]Just who are you?
[86:58.63]Why approach me?
[86:59.87]What are you after?
[87:01.15]Me?
[87:01.73]Yes, well, people here call me Bacchus.
[87:04.07]And I come here because you had me angry one time.
[87:06.42]Yeah, nice of you to dump him on me.
[87:10.34]Look, if you're in some trouble, tell me.
[87:11.64]Maybe I can help.
[87:13.32]And that goes for him, too.
[87:14.78]Those weren't the moves of an amateur.
[87:16.39]What's his deal?
[87:18.05]A real steal of a deal is what it is.
[87:20.78]He's got a gig sweatier than honey.
[87:25.00]He's fascinating to watch.
[87:26.80]You should go have a look too.
[87:29.38]At Komeito's job, but he's homeless, right?
[87:31.26]What kind of work does he do?
[87:33.22]He's a, what do you call it?
[87:35.14]A fisting artist.
[87:37.72]Whoa, that's not really my scene.
[87:41.50]Let's punch out.
[87:43.10]Yeah, that, a punch out artist.
[87:44.40]Yeah, slip of the tongue.
[87:47.24]Alright, so what's a punch out artist?
[87:50.71]The customer pays a fee, then they get to throw as many punches at me as they like.
[87:54.49]I don't think I follow.
[87:55.25]This is some new S&M thing.
[87:58.17]Nah, nothing like that.
[87:59.26]Come on and watch.
[88:00.06]If you got questions, I work in the Shichu Fuku parking lot.
[88:04.62]Jimu-kun, he's got plenty to teach about fighting, my boy.
[88:07.78]You'll kick yourself if you don't check it out.
[88:10.54]Alright, I'll get the picture.
[88:11.50]Parking lot, right?
[88:12.28]I swing by if I can.
[88:15.02]It's Kirusan from the Dojima family, right?
[88:16.90]I'll be waiting.
[88:17.46]See you soon.
[88:19.14]Okay.
[88:20.26]So where am I gonna go here?
[88:24.14]Well that takes care of my troubles for today I suppose.
[88:26.52]Still can't convince you to take on the world?
[88:30.85]The world?
[88:31.31]What does it even mean?
[88:31.95]Are you still trying to recruit me into the pro fighting scene?
[88:35.01]It's exactly what it was.
[88:36.09]You got potential most men can't even dream about.
[88:37.93]That would champ the title be yours.
[88:39.33]Sorry I'm not the same starry eyed kid who would fall for that kind of line.
[88:44.17]You look at the scout somebody you keep looking.
[88:46.60]I'll tell you one thing, boy.
[88:47.96]You keep living street fight to street fight.
[88:50.38]You'll wind up with a knife between your ribs.
[88:52.62]It's a dark alley.
[88:53.46]That's no way to go out.
[88:55.36]You belong in the light.
[88:56.16]The spotlight.
[88:56.88]And I can't get you under the brightest ones.
[88:58.48]What do you say?
[89:00.46]Okay.
[89:02.06]We just met.
[89:02.56]You're not one to change your life around because some old geezer told you to.
[89:05.22]So I give up.
[89:07.58]That doesn't mean giving up for good.
[89:09.54]You got room to grow like a tree.
[89:11.25]I'll keep coaching you along the way.
[89:14.33]You've got skills as a trainer.
[89:15.77]That much, I believe.
[89:17.09]But I'm not really in a position to be worried about that.
[89:20.27]Sorry.
[89:20.97]But hey, maybe I'll see you around.
[89:22.69]Okay, my boy.
[89:23.61]Just steer clear of the dark alley still, then, you hear?
[89:25.99]No knives in those ribs.
[89:27.15]Or bullets, for that matter.
[89:30.05]Are you trying to jinx me?
[89:31.57]See you later, Bacchus.
[89:33.70]Okay.
[89:38.44]Apparently, the Toko accredited president's in his office on Tai Boulevard East.
[89:41.56]I'll start there.
[89:43.28]Alright, let's go.
[89:47.81]I'm gonna head down this way.
[89:48.67]I'm stuck.
[90:02.04]Oh.
[90:02.56]Oh.
[90:02.92]Oh.
[90:03.08]What is... Oh.
[90:06.47]Oh, man.
[90:07.37]These guys... Oh, shit.
[90:09.03]These guys got weapons.
[90:11.85]What?
[90:13.67]Never mind.
[90:13.97]These guys have weapons.
[90:14.87]No, they don't.
[90:15.31]What?
[90:15.45]What?
[90:19.60]I don't have any weapons.
[90:20.44]Why did I say that?
[90:37.67]He's punching the air.
[90:50.64]What do I think of the game so far?
[90:51.70]Jokes aside.
[90:52.32]I don't know.
[90:55.83]See me when I after three hours.
[91:04.33]Boring, it's not boring.
[91:05.91]I can't.
[91:06.23]I'm not saying that yet.
[91:10.05]OK, so.
[91:14.19]I go in here or.
[91:16.32]Why?
[91:17.78]In the trash.
[91:24.50]What am I looking at here?
[91:36.53]What's, what is, what's here?
[91:44.11]The front?
[91:46.88]The door?
[91:48.40]Oh, I tried to click on this.
[91:51.40]I hit A on this like three times.
[91:54.70]Alright, let's get ready first.
[91:59.48]Let me save the game.
[92:10.67]Go to karaoke?
[92:11.85]No, hold on.
[92:12.55]Not yet.
[92:19.46]That bastard.
[92:20.16]Alright, let's get some EXP.
[92:24.84]I'm not going to go play Blackjack.
[92:26.06]Let me play the game first.
[92:27.04]I'm not going to go play Blackjack.
[92:29.98]Go play Mahjong.
[92:48.20]No, I want to play.
[92:50.42]Leave me alone.
[92:50.94]Leave me alone.
[92:51.42]Leave me alone.
[92:51.86]Leave me alone.
[92:52.30]Leave me alone.
[93:01.94]Oh my God.
[93:02.62]I'm sorry, sir.
[93:13.41]Yeah, good.
[93:22.31]Well, you know, let's just do the first mission.
[93:23.55]Let's do it.
[93:24.11]I'm ready.
[93:31.47]Zhang is more entertaining than the game.
[93:32.84]There's a great link.
[93:34.78]No, no.
[93:35.70]I have to get to the... Okay, I will link this because this is funny.
[93:44.40]This is funny.
[93:45.18]It's very good.
[93:53.35]I feel like I've aged that much too.
[93:58.29]What's with the huge amount of subs?
[94:00.63]42 community subs from Bingo?
[94:03.82]Bingo Julius just gave 42 subs.
[94:06.52]Oh my god.
[94:09.02]That's too many subs.
[94:15.91]Thank you.
[94:16.57]Thank you, Bingo.
[94:19.15]That's insane.
[94:25.16]Oh, these guys are toast.
[94:27.02]Oh, never mind that.
[94:27.56]Weapon.
[94:28.14]Weapon.

[94:28.60]Weapon.
[94:28.76]Weapon.
[94:28.94]Weapon.
[94:55.14]Worst joke.
[94:55.74]Alright, it's time to play the game.
[94:59.03]We had our fun.
[95:00.57]Now I want to actually do good.
[95:28.35]Break it.
[95:29.27]So I have.
[95:30.47]How do I activate the rush?
[95:32.53]I kind of wasn't paying attention to that.
[95:33.81]I'll be honest.
[95:41.70]It is activated.
[95:48.62]How do I?
[95:48.94]There's V. No, no, no.
[95:50.50]On a controller.
[95:55.50]Left on D-pad.
[95:56.28]There it is.
[95:56.62]Thank you.
[96:02.27]Any more snacks?
[96:09.99]What the fuck?
[96:12.64]Alright, here we go.
[96:13.14]Brawler.
[96:22.66]Oh, that's right.
[96:23.04]This stance is right.
[96:25.20]This game is sick.
[96:31.80]Oh, I missed the cutscene.
[96:38.98]Right in the head.
[96:43.24]Forced enjoyment.
[96:44.92]Dude, I'm having so much fun in this game.
[96:46.14]Sick.
[96:46.52]Nice.

[96:47.68]Cool.
[96:48.24]Sick.
[96:48.62]Sick.
[96:55.05]It is fun.
[97:05.11]How do I get health?
[97:06.46]I'm running out.
[97:18.44]No way.
[97:18.92]How'd you make it here?
[97:19.62]Snacks, right?
[97:19.98]What are you talking about?
[97:31.23]Hey, don't come any closer!
[97:32.33]I-I-I got it!
[97:33.01]I'll tell you everything!
[97:37.27]So, just wait a minute!
[97:55.28]I didn't want to leave you.
[97:56.54]I just did what you asked me to do.
[97:59.36]I wanted to get you back to where you are now.
[98:02.47]Who asked you to do that?
[98:03.19]That person... Oh, right.
[98:04.07]This is what I'm talking about.
[98:06.83]That stupid brother of yours.
[98:15.91]It can't be...
[98:24.35]uh-oh
[98:54.51]Back in the day, one punch was enough to straighten out little shits like you.
[99:02.47]What do you mean back in the day?
[99:04.34]Like when I was a kid?
[99:05.36]Like when I was like... How old was I?
[99:07.14]What?
[99:07.46]What the fuck are you talking about?
[99:09.00]Go... Go yukkuri...
[99:24.09]How long have I known this guy for?
[99:25.15]He's like in his 50s.
[99:31.85]Oh no.
[99:46.36]Not another cigarette.
[100:03.45]It's a good opportunity.
[100:06.42]I wanted to have a talk with you.
[100:08.32]You and Nishikiyama are orphans, right?
[100:13.46]It's the name of the facility the head of Kazama runs, isn't it?
[100:19.46]I think it's called Himawari.
[100:32.79]It's no shame.
[100:33.37]Listen to this dead air streamer.
[100:35.08]Cool.
[100:35.52]Cool.
[101:00.60]You and Nishikiyama.
[101:03.36]It's not a waste of life for them.
[101:05.36]Is this what you call war?
[101:10.34]King of Dead Air.
[101:11.36]Well, it's a cutscene.
[101:13.04]Every time I talk over cutscenes, people get so mad at me.

[104:05.46]It's not a number I recognize.
[104:07.33]Who is it?
[104:10.21]I don't recognize the number.
[104:12.33]It's not his number, but that's got to be Nishiki calling.
[104:15.70]I'll find a phone and call him back.
[104:24.76]It has me worried.
[104:25.36]I got to find a payphone.
[104:29.38]I am trying to find a payphone.
[104:30.68]What are you doing?
[104:33.22]Oh, it's blocked.

[105:00.12]Get off.
[105:03.78]What?
[105:04.44]Oh, shit.
[105:05.02]Why did I swing backwards?
[105:18.91]I got to spend some money.
[105:19.61]How much money do I have?
[105:29.05]Let me go.
[105:29.63]Just save it for the debt?

[106:52.81]We heard about the empty lot.
[106:53.83]Mhm.
[107:09.16]That's like a green Elmo phone.
[107:14.36]I've never seen a green phone before like that.
[107:27.56]Alright, so can I look at the map?

[107:54.02]Maybe I'll grab a bite at Fuji Soba.
[107:56.62]Yes.
[107:59.88]Soba and hot broth.
[108:02.50]This house classic features freshly boiled soba noodles served in a piping hot homemade soup

[108:27.49]Delicious.
[108:31.56]I want another one.
[108:33.54]But a small one.
[108:35.74]Have you ever been to Japan?
[108:36.60]I have not.
[108:38.39]I've always wanted to go.
[108:45.38]Let's get the cheap one.
[108:50.32]I feel like before I die, I want to go to Tokyo.

[119:35.75]Let's start the mission.
[119:38.55]I got plenty of items.
[119:46.22]Save the game first.
[119:47.88]It's important.
[119:58.41]Go do karaoke first.
[120:02.05]No.
[120:04.36]I'm not going to do karaoke the first... No, I already did karaoke once.
[120:09.30]Let's do the mission.
[120:18.41]Let's go.
[120:22.39]I will do karaoke.
[120:23.41]I'll do all the minigame stuff.
[120:38.44]karaoke now alright when I wasn't looking it kind of sounded like he was ripping a bunch of tape
[121:08.50]He was taping a bunch of shit up on the desk.
[121:09.90]Did he ask you to sell out Kazama?
[121:10.96]He did.
[121:11.18]Bastard.
[121:36.61]I mean, he frowned him.
[121:37.65]I don't know what happened, Kiryu.
[121:39.03]Anyway, tell me everything.
[122:07.68]Well, you see, it all started when I went into his office and would've just played that cutscene again, but with a filter on it.
[122:13.62]They would do that. ...
[122:39.36]Sorry, I had my hand around my neck.
[122:41.28]You had three what?
[123:09.36]I was rubbing my neck like this.
[123:10.32]I am paying attention.
[123:11.28]Yes, I am.
[123:11.88]He's just choking himself instead of watching the cutscene.
[123:17.75]No, I am paying attention to the cutscene.
[123:35.71]You're sitting there watching a movie with your friend.
[123:40.19]And this dude is fucking strangling himself.
[123:43.65]Do you not like the movie?
[123:45.19]We can put on like diners, drive-ins, and dives if you want.
[123:48.99]No, man.
[123:49.73]I love this fucking movie.
[123:51.01]It's great.
[123:51.35]What?
[124:05.92]Only a single piece of land?
[124:10.32]Hey, if you spend a single piece of land, the redevelopment itself will be delayed.
[124:16.96]But the Dojima group has already invested one billion yen in the development of the whole area.
[124:25.61]I can't.
[124:27.31]I gotta mute.
[124:28.21]Kuzu said he had some information he needed to get that land.
[124:34.70]What the hell?
[124:35.99]Summarize this cutscene.
[124:37.03]Okay.
[124:38.41]Yeah, I can.
[124:39.55]So, this is the boss.
[124:40.99]This is one of the bosses.
[124:59.13]Guys, I don't even know this person's name.
[125:00.81]I don't know the main character's name.
[125:02.97]Keanu.
[125:03.43]What's his name?
[125:03.90]Kiryu.
[125:05.52]Kiryu.
[125:06.04]Fuck.
[125:06.26]I'm sorry.
[125:31.42]We're trying to get rid of the other boss.
[125:34.80]There's three bosses, four bosses.
[125:40.32]We're all fighting over the same place.
[125:41.70]That old man... Hamon?
[125:50.18]I don't have to tell you the history of the Hamon Gokudo.
[125:55.30]I'm watching a foreign film without subtitles because I'm like reading chat too so I'm not absorbing any of this.
[126:00.04]Like if it was English I would be able to hear a lot of this too.
[126:04.16]I'm like just hanging out with you guys reading chat and I'm just hearing Japanese.
[126:27.30]That's not good.
[126:27.76]No, I'm good.
[126:28.83]I'm good.
[126:29.05]We gotta watch our asses.
[126:31.51]Watch ourselves.
[126:55.63]What should we do?
[127:02.07]Kashiwagi-san.
[127:07.32]Huh?
[127:07.76]For now, focus on the game for 10 minutes.
[127:09.86]Okay, I will.
[127:11.44]I swear to God.
[127:13.28]I'm not looking at chat.
[127:14.04]I'm going to focus for 10 straight minutes.
[127:15.88]Do you have any good ideas?
[127:20.27]Yes.
[127:20.41]I, Fushimatsu, will do it myself.
[127:24.70]Alright, I'm responsible.
[127:26.42]But what am I responsible for?
[127:27.88]Let's see.
[127:30.65]Okay, Kazama.
[127:33.27]We don't want him to come back to Kazama.
[127:46.68]I'm taking the fall for this.
[127:53.60]alright so then I'm not tied to like the Yakuza family right
[128:20.84]The Yakuza, right?
[128:22.34]Okay.
[128:23.20]I'm on out.
[128:24.58]Okay.
[128:46.92]In your car.
[128:49.74]Let's go.
[128:50.26]We're going to settle this right now.
[128:52.07]They're framing people.
[128:52.73]They're framing people.
[129:05.81]Is what Nishikiyama said true?
[129:09.36]I don't care if it's true or not.
[129:11.78]In the end, I'm just an idiot who became a goku-don to follow Kazama-no-Oyashi-san.
[129:19.22]If I'm going to cause trouble to O-Yashi-san with my Fushimatsu, I'm also prepared.
[129:28.99]I'm not saying that you're underestimating me.
[129:32.37]Huh?
[129:32.57]Can't you hear what I'm saying?
[129:35.74]Okay He's playing PUBG on his phone right now I just had it like the sound effects
[130:07.18]I don't have it installed.
[130:17.66]Stop reading chat.
[130:18.54]He was lying on the ground with a painful face.
[130:21.08]I can pay attention.
[130:21.78]I can look away for a second.
[130:22.98]There's no dialog there.
[130:42.36]Okay.
[130:44.84]Now we're framed for the murder of the guy in the beginning.
[130:50.89]We're out of the family now.
[130:52.61]We're trying to stop these guys from framing people for murders.
[130:57.53]Especially when it's me.
[131:14.44]Both.
[131:20.25]Yeah, you can't just leave.
[131:21.89]You can't get out, right?
[131:24.71]Let's go.
[131:25.19]Okay.
[131:46.97]a bad deal in chat no I'm I'm ready I'm ready to complete what was the vaude for the last one three hours and what 335 okay
[132:16.05]We'll decide our own path.
[132:16.67]It's a different story than the one we've been raised on.
[132:23.63]It's too late.
[132:24.55]You're a Yakuza too, aren't you?
[132:26.81]Then you don't have the right to stop us from becoming Yakuza!
[132:56.20]We've looked up to you.
[132:58.73]You won't let us be in Yakuza.
[133:23.70]I thought he was driving.
[133:39.29]Is he driving?
[133:40.38]Pay attention.
[133:40.90]What the fuck?
[133:41.84]Oh, God.
[133:42.28]I thought he was driving the car and just off.
[133:44.82]He's in his own world.
[133:45.66]I'm like, holy shit, dude.
[133:46.62]What are you doing?
[133:50.06]Finally, you say something.
[133:54.16]We're watching a cutscene!
[134:17.54]Every so often, I'm going to take the back of my hand and get you in the chest.
[134:21.94]Hey, hey.
[134:22.80]Did you see that?
[134:24.28]They wanted to beat Yakuza.

[135:11.21]Yeah, I really gotta stop treating the cutscenes in this game like I'm in a league queue.
[135:17.63]Alright, yeah, whatever.
[135:20.98]I'm just gonna play, like, fuckin' Picross for, like, 12 minutes until the queue pops. ...
[135:42.33]Oh, there's still a lot of subs that I missed, too.

[144:19.88]Oh, I can't do the TV, really?
[144:23.94]Money.
[144:27.18]Box of nails.
[144:32.08]Why would you have a box of nails in this room?
[144:37.36]Ow.
[144:45.54]Murder somebody with the nails.
[144:47.22]I think I've lost my opportunity.
[144:49.54]Well, so for this guy.
[144:57.07]Oh, it's him.
[145:05.20]What?
[145:05.93]What's going on?
[145:10.97]Let's go get this sofa out of the fucking way.
[145:23.00]Oh.
[145:25.32]Gotcha.
[145:26.66]Ooh, what's that?
[145:27.60]Sorry, you missed.
[145:29.48]Getting a little exciting here, I think.
[145:30.88]Getting a little excitement.
[145:35.83]Holy fuck.
[145:40.19]Should I drink one of those drinks?
[145:49.38]Oh.
[145:50.70]Oh.
[145:54.94]Who's left?
[145:57.34]What's this?
[145:58.22]Toughness.
[145:59.08]Oh.
[146:01.10]That's alright.
[146:06.37]I dropped the bat?
[146:07.37]Why would I put the bat down?
[146:08.55]Let's grab him.
[146:17.64]Grab him and just smash his head into the box.
[146:24.06]Rush.
[146:26.90]He dodged it.
[146:33.16]No, you're better than I am.
[146:40.49]Who's left?
[146:40.75]Who's left?
[146:41.01]Who's left?
[146:41.27]Who's left?
[146:42.11]Whoa!
[146:47.49]One punch in the face.
[146:48.22]Dead.
[146:49.72]No.
[146:49.98]Brawler.
[146:50.38]Give me that.
[146:54.76]No.
[146:55.36]Give me the bat.
[147:02.79]Block.
[147:05.00]How did I not block that?
[147:21.78]Get him!
[147:22.78]Get him!
[147:26.91]What?
[147:27.65]Was it the other guy?
[147:28.33]Oh, no.
[147:29.13]Okay.
[147:38.21]Grab the box of nails.
[147:39.47]Grab the box of nails.
[147:40.47]Grab the box of nails.
[147:41.45]Nails, nails, nails.
[147:42.27]I got the nails.
[147:42.87]I got the nails.
[147:47.55]Whoa.
[147:57.29]Did he throw it?
[147:58.21]Are you waiting for me to...
[148:18.26]Okay, now let's kill this guy with the nails.
[148:25.48]Die!
[148:26.70]Die!
[148:28.10]Die!
[148:31.18]Nice, I killed him, but no, I didn't.
[148:39.91]Not going to fail QTEs right now.
[148:41.59]That guy doesn't stay down.
[148:48.38]Ah, that hurts.
[148:49.74]The stool.
[148:50.46]The stool is a great weapon, by the way.
[148:54.60]You got blunt side, you got sharp side.
[148:56.41]It's like a hammer.
[149:07.69]Hammer is the best weapon.
[149:08.43]If I was in medieval times, I'd use a hammer.
[149:11.79]Doesn't even matter what kind of hammer.
[149:15.45]I don't, whoa, you want like one of those iron like super hammers?
[149:19.05]Big ones?
[149:19.41]No, no, just a regular just Home Depot hammer.
[149:36.32]A medieval Home Depot hammer.
[149:39.52]No, you know what I mean.
[149:46.07]They have a medieval section at Home Depot.
[149:47.93]Here are the swords, the maces.
[149:49.86]Alright, give me, just stool this guy in the head.
[150:07.85]I missed it.
[150:08.51]It's hard to see.
[150:10.37]Back to 300,000.
[150:24.35]Alright, just I'm gonna dig this into his head.
[150:27.85]Oh my God, I'm queuing it up.
[150:29.87]That's awesome.
[150:30.49]What a cool move.
[150:47.36]Nice.
[150:48.40]Nice.
[150:48.74]How's the game so far, Jeremy?
[150:54.46]This part's great.
[150:55.40]I like this part.
[151:05.15]Blocked from the other side.
[151:06.09]Damn.
[151:18.39]He likes it.
[151:19.23]Yeah, I like The Simpsons episodes.
[151:29.38]Alright, they're just peeing, right?
[151:33.42]This is gross.
[151:34.58]Gross.
[151:43.09]Alright, I'm going to smash everybody's head into the sink.
[151:46.43]That's all I want to do.
[151:56.43]Into the stall.
[151:56.93]Put somebody's head in the stall.
[152:06.94]Stop it.
[152:07.28]Come here.
[152:14.70]Into the toilet.
[152:24.19]Come on.
[152:24.35]Come here.
[152:24.67]Get him in his sink.
[152:29.47]Into the sink.
[152:30.25]Oh, no.
[152:30.87]I can't put his mouth into the water.
[152:42.99]It's me again.
[152:46.51]This time I have a knife.
[152:49.19]The stool didn't work.
[152:50.55]The plate didn't work.
[153:08.37]Oh, fuck, that hurts.
[153:08.99]Ow, my side!
[153:40.74]Alright, get over here.
[153:43.40]No, I can't grab him and do that.
[153:45.36]I'll throw him out the window.
[153:46.36]Oh shit, my god.
[153:50.82]I lost all my points.
[154:04.35]Come over the window.
[154:05.01]Can I throw him out the window?
[154:05.77]Can I actually do that?
[154:13.88]Get out the window.
[154:14.32]Fuck.
[154:15.12]Alright, out the window.
[154:22.43]He's almost dead.
[154:25.86]Hurry, in the urinal, hurry.
[154:43.28]Out the window, get him.
[154:48.24]Oh, by the way, is this a Simpsons episode or is this a Family Guy episode?
[154:52.78]Like the chicken keeps coming back and trying to kill me for like 10 straight minutes.
[154:56.50]Give me that drink.
[155:13.61]Where are they?
[155:19.54]Didn't wash his hands.
[155:20.54]This is the WWE part.
[155:43.52]I scouted a good kid.
[155:45.06]When I was still boxing, I wanted to meet you or become a promoter.
[155:51.97]Bastard.
[155:53.13]Spit it out before I can't hear you.
[155:54.61]Who is the real culprit?
[155:59.11]Who is it?
[155:59.65]Where is it hidden?
[156:00.29]The kid...
[156:12.41]You've got to get through me first.
[156:17.63]I mean, I played this part.
[156:18.47]It seems that I made a mistake because of the useless people down there.
[156:35.78]Don't underestimate the Dojima, Kiryu.
[156:43.16]It's time to fight.
[156:45.90]Versus... Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[156:49.66]Ojima family lieutenant.
[156:53.48]Tojo clan.
[156:54.04]Couldn't read it.
[157:14.67]I'm a brawler.
[157:15.27]Come on.
[157:17.48]One on one.
[157:17.82]Let's go.
[157:24.81]Oh, what's that?
[157:25.69]Oh, so hard.
[157:44.24]Can't even do anything.
[157:44.92]Oh, what's that?
[157:46.34]I grabbed you?
[157:48.32]Pathetic.
[157:49.90]I own the family now.
[157:50.72]It's my family.
[157:56.75]You see what I did to that Family Guy chicken for the last 20 minutes?
[158:06.91]Ow.
[158:07.03]Uh-oh.
[158:14.84]He was warming up.
[158:15.42]He's just warming up.
[158:16.09]We're good.
[158:18.85]Okay, he's... Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[158:35.30]Oh, he's got fire.
[158:40.12]Oh, shit.
[158:40.42]Okay, we're good.
[158:40.76]We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[158:58.03]Turn the difficulty up.
[159:00.35]It's not on easy.
[159:01.39]No, I don't need to turn difficulty up right now.
[159:04.22]What do you mean?
[159:09.94]It's too easy.
[159:11.26]It's not easy.
[159:13.17]It's challenging.
[159:13.97]It's challenging combat with some quick times.
[159:27.87]Use different heat actions.
[159:30.65]Oh, I... Hold on.
[159:32.33]We'll talk about that later.
[159:36.06]Ow.
[159:42.92]I'm getting out of here.
[159:44.46]I got too confident.
[160:02.07]Take a break, hold on, I need a drink.
[160:03.90]He's chucking Estus.
[160:12.90]What BM was that?
[160:21.98]Fuck, okay, let me win.
[160:24.80]Fucking come on, stop.
[160:42.64]Fuck, I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[161:09.50]Fuck you.
[161:10.04]I'm switching stances.
[161:10.74]Get him.
[161:30.75]Get him.
[161:31.27]On the ground.
[161:46.60]No you dick!
[162:02.75]Big finish.
[162:08.77]Fuck.
[162:10.50]I have to end it like that.
[162:20.12]That was fun.
[162:24.76]Kiryu... You... K-Kyōdai... Take him away!
[162:41.25]I'll kill him!
[162:52.92]Phase 2 of 10.
[162:54.14]Yeah.
[163:16.48]Patriarch of the Dojima family.
[163:20.58]A Do-
[163:23.72]I thought you were hiding something.
[163:30.24]I know you're the young leader of Dojima, but you're so shameless.
[163:38.49]You're too far away from Kazama.
[163:39.71]But father, this is the kid that the leader picked up.
[163:47.17]Kazama Kiryu.
[163:56.03]It's not true.
[163:59.45]It's not true.
[164:00.38]Not true.
[164:01.26]No, don't.
[164:03.36]There's lies about me. ...
[164:26.05]Do you want me to turn you into a monster?
[164:29.87]Don't say such a good thing, you bastard!
[164:33.81]Hey, I'll take care of him.
[164:36.29]I won't bother my father anymore.
[164:38.65]You... Are you going to fight against me?
[164:44.49]Didn't Kiryu let you out of the group because you were the best?
[164:54.54]Bro.
[165:21.81]oh man it's a total cross total double cross
[165:58.18]oh he's got he's yeah he's gotta cut off his uh he's gotta cut yeah
[166:27.90]Take a good look at me!
[166:37.10]Take this!
[167:02.54]No, this is not The Simpsons episode part.
[167:24.83]My young boss once said...
[167:29.71]Hmm.
[167:30.29]As of today, you are expelled from the family.
[167:33.29]Thanks, but just want to let you know, I'm coming for all of you.
[167:43.53]Eventually.
[167:47.00]Thank you.
[167:47.34]Kiryu.
[167:52.60]Why did you have to go through all this trouble to get out of the group?
[167:58.93]To reveal the truth about Kazama and my father's death.
[168:02.51]In this case, I'm the one who killed him.
[168:11.62]Kazama and my father have nothing to do with it.
[168:13.64]However, the man who stole my money died in that pot.
[168:23.64]Oh, thanks for like the tweet explaining the story.
[168:29.58]I didn't know anything up until right now.
[168:31.44]Perfect.
[168:35.08]I know exactly what's going on now. ...
[168:51.47]What is the responsibility that you have to take?
[168:53.43]That's right.
[168:54.31]I will definitely catch the man who killed that man.
[169:01.37]And then I will kill Kazama and his wife.
[169:03.09]I see.
[169:05.01]There is no need for that.
[169:06.23]But the culprit...
[169:18.72]Killer.
[169:19.04]Yes.
[169:20.58]At least...
[169:45.67]If I don't get caught up in that place, I might end up like this.
[169:49.00]That's why I called for you.
[169:51.52]That's right.
[169:52.34]Don't worry.
[169:52.76]I'll make sure you get caught.
[169:57.78]What?
[169:58.04]The kid Kazama picked up.
[170:01.04]Kiryu.
[170:01.34]Your indecision made it hard for me to get hold of that land.
[170:14.53]Kazama is responsible for that.
[170:20.52]You were also a Gokudo until now.
[170:24.12]You know what I mean, don't you?
[170:27.29]Comrade Dojima.
[170:27.91]Once you've become a Gokudo, that's it.
[170:30.67]You should look for a way to be happy as a Katagi.
[170:42.79]That's a pretty good episode.
[170:52.23]Stream.
[170:59.66]Oh my god, stream is gone.
[171:01.88]I'm attacked.
[171:05.24]It's over.
[171:06.32]Oh shit.
[171:07.46]I forgot.
[171:11.45]It's alright.
[171:12.15]I was playing it through the microphone.
[171:13.85]I was playing it through the microphone.
[171:15.70]It doesn't matter.
[171:17.48]That was me singing that.
[171:18.38]That was me humming it with my mouth.
[171:39.28]was this like a jazz version what is this this doesn't happen in The Simpsons theme song this is not The Simpsons theme song that's like a completely different version
[172:01.79]Look at the game.
[172:02.41]Oh, right.
[172:02.83]Alright, we got an umbrella.
[172:04.67]Somebody under an umbrella and they're teaching us something.
[172:07.09]They've been waiting for us for a long time.
[172:08.97]They've been waiting.
[172:10.45]Yes, I knew it.
[172:16.21]Kiryu.
[172:16.55]Kazuma-san.
[172:35.40]that's chapter one eleven twelve million uh twelve million million yen nice climax battles have opened save it yeah chapter two the real estate broker in the shadows cool
[173:42.48]Big windows.
[173:43.30]I talked about that already.
[173:46.04]People can see everything.
[173:47.02]You're just a giant TV show for everybody that looks up.
[173:49.38]It's not dangerous for me, Kiryu-san.
[173:51.66]Please relax.
[174:16.42]Tinted?
[174:19.17]Well, alright.
[174:20.11]So, sure.
[174:21.91]Tinted windows.
[174:22.55]Would you stand naked in front of that window?
[174:26.05]No, you wouldn't.
[174:27.17]Yeah.
[174:47.55]What's for dinner?
[174:48.57]What do we got?
[174:52.08]What do we got?
[175:15.54]Your right hand is the Gishu.
[175:18.14]The wrong way to use it is to use your right hand.
[175:23.18]After losing it a few years ago, it hurts when it gets cold.
[175:27.28]It's a strange thing, so I can't even use my fingers and the painkillers.
[175:31.24]All I can do is endure the pain.
[175:34.02]But it's troublesome to put the pain on my face, so I stopped.
[175:38.43]I've never heard of that.
[175:40.67]Kiryu-san, do you know the word tojo-kajo?
[175:45.91]Sweden.
[175:46.37]Pseudo.
[175:46.91]Pseudanthium.
[175:48.47]Pseudanthium.
[176:07.97]The big flower of Himawari is a collection of many small flowers.
[176:12.90]It's a good name to use in a nursing home where children gather.
[176:19.86]Kazama-san, did you name yourself Himawari?
[176:24.46]What are you?
[176:26.50]You grew up with Nishikiyama-san and your siblings in Himawari.
[176:32.01]There's another one, a young lady named Yumi Sawamura-san.
[176:36.62]Eventually, you and Nishikiyama-san followed Kazama-san, who was your parent, and entered the world of Gokudo.
[176:45.88]Mm-hmm.
[176:46.05]And now, you're being accused of murder.
[176:48.55]Because of that, Kazama-san is also in danger of murder.
[176:51.95]Why are you narrating my life when I know what my life was?
[176:54.05]I understand very well that you investigated me.
[176:58.71]You seem to have a great amount of information.
[177:02.17]But why did you investigate me?
[177:04.89]What is your purpose?
[177:07.88]You don't know.
[177:08.34]He knows.
[177:08.96]That's right.
[177:09.34]Empty blood.
[177:09.80]That bread.
[177:10.08]I want that bread right now.
[177:29.82]If we get the empty lot, then Kazama's expulsion is guaranteed.
[177:35.10]If we get the empty lot, then Kazama's expulsion is guaranteed.
[177:58.55]10 seconds.
[177:59.05]No, it's not true.
[177:59.63]335.
[177:59.65]We did it.
[178:00.15]I want to give it the chance it deserves.
[178:02.49]I want to play it.
[178:29.46]Looks like I underestimated you.
[178:30.54]But I believe that you will come to your senses one day.
[178:33.88]At the very least, can I have this business card?
[178:37.90]Yes.
[178:37.98]I understand.
[178:38.46]I'll bring the clothes right away.
[178:41.78]Then, I'll take this.
[178:52.91]You're three hours in.
[178:53.75]You should know by now if you think it's a good game.
[178:56.56]Well, that's not necessarily true.
[178:58.24]I mean, look at like Metal Gear Solid 3 or Metal Gear Solid 4.
[179:00.86]Wasn't that game like four hours of cutscenes before you pressed B to punch anybody?
[179:21.52]And look at that series, right?
[179:23.16]Alright, so here we are.
[179:25.62]Let's save it.
[179:28.40]Is the arcade open?
[179:29.90]If it is, you know exactly where I'm going.
[179:44.63]Alright, so let's take a look at the map.
[179:49.33]Alright, so we have SEGA high-tech land and the bowling alley.
[179:53.85]Let's go.
[179:54.21]I want to go to high-tech land.
[180:05.91]Is this SEGA high-tech land?
[180:08.53]No?
[180:11.18]Wait, did I?
[180:11.58]Okay, yeah, that's it.
[180:13.48]Where is it?
[180:17.04]Wrong way?
[180:19.44]Entrance is on the other side.
[180:20.46]Oh.
[180:24.72]I don't have time to fight you.
[180:25.66]I want to play video games.
[180:28.82]Leave me alone.
[180:29.32]This is dumb.
[180:32.70]No, it's not.

[186:15.63]How do I leave?
[186:18.12]I want to do that thing where you buy, uh, you put like five quarters into the machine and you have to leave the arcade.
[186:25.06]So you're just like, no, but I can't leave.
[186:27.20]There's like five, there's five credits in here, but you have to fucking go.

[191:11.17]Are you selling these?
[191:11.87]What are you doing?
[191:15.95]Alright, this could be a double.
[191:16.71]It's possible.
[191:22.00]I hit the lip.
[191:22.70]Shit.
[191:22.90]I can do it.
[191:27.14]I just have a handful of prizes.
[191:29.06]This five-year-old behind me.
[191:30.92]It's going to happen again.
[191:35.31]It's going to happen again.
[191:36.03]Shit.
[191:36.23]I'm an idiot.
[191:44.39]Oh, yes.
[191:44.99]It still worked.
[191:53.54]Cleaning out my local woe.
[191:58.89]Oh, I have these are actually in my inventory.
[192:01.13]OK, we're going to replace.
[192:04.73]I don't know one of these.

[192:48.41]All three lizards are mine.
[192:51.25]What a deal.
[192:53.93]What's the deal?
[192:55.51]Let's see.
[192:57.55]Look at this image for $100 million off your extraordinary debt.
[193:02.14]That's too easy.
[193:03.00]I mean, that's too easy.
[193:07.86]Wrong one?
[193:08.48]Oh.
[193:12.04]New deal.
[193:12.50]When Mr. Green plays gaming games, total is doubled.
[193:18.42]When he plays gambling games, the... What do you mean?
[193:21.46]That's not... Wrong one again.
[193:26.50]Get offer.
[193:27.54]Major look, there are no offers.
[193:28.86]People need to stop spamming links so much these days.
[193:31.54]Play Pathologic and Pathologic 2.
[193:33.45]Time that person out for an hour.
[193:46.06]You got your game shoutout.
[194:01.61]Alright, well, I have an opportunity.
[194:02.77]Might as well just try to get everything.
[194:04.79]Oh.
[194:17.46]Can I sell these?
[194:18.10]What do I do with them?
[194:18.68]Do I do karaoke?
[194:32.07]I will.
[194:32.61]I will.
[194:42.94]Pathologic was one of the most awful games I have ever played.
[194:45.96]Jesus.
[194:46.66]Alright, let's go do some other fun toy stuff.
[194:50.10]Can I play this one?
[194:52.02]No.
[194:58.50]What are some other toys I can play with?
[195:09.15]high-tech bowling alley adding practice yep dude I used to go to the batting cages and just absolutely destroy
[195:30.25]There'd be a 14-year-old next to me.
[195:32.31]There'd be, like, an 18-year-old in the other cage.
[195:35.42]And I'd be in the middle.
[195:36.54]And I would just be hitting fucking home runs.
[195:38.68]I'd be destroying.
[195:48.04]I would hit the net.
[195:49.84]I would hit the back net in the cages every time.
[196:03.62]Getting a high score can win you cool prizes.
[196:06.34]I don't care about your prizes.
[196:07.28]I care about winning.
[196:11.14]I don't want the prize.
[196:11.86]I just want to win.
[196:14.82]Advanced.
[196:15.26]No, no.
[196:15.48]Let's start easy.
[196:22.18]Let's go to the one that I would go to.
[196:23.22]The one that just lobs them.
[196:25.76]So you can just... You're essentially just chopping wood.
[196:35.53]It's just, I'm going to just swing as hard as I can and just break this wooden half.
[196:46.40]I think I would really love that, by the way.
[196:47.78]I probably should have figured out how to play first.
[196:52.18]Oh, no.
[196:52.80]Do I?
[196:53.36]No, I don't.
[196:53.98]That's so loud.
[196:54.74]Holy fuck, that's horrible.
[196:56.79]I gotta hold on a minute.
[196:57.65]That, like, actually hurt my head.
[196:59.85]That was painful.
[197:00.41]Okay, that's better.
[197:10.76]That was very slow.
[197:13.62]That was very slow.
[197:15.90]I didn't even see it go by.
[197:23.44]Okay.
[197:24.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[197:25.30]Let me just do the training first.
[197:26.80]Let me do the training.
[197:27.66]Let me do the training.
[197:31.09]How to play.
[197:33.75]Press A with the right timing to hit balls, of course.
[197:37.57]Okay.
[197:39.45]Okay.
[197:41.72]Okay.
[197:44.57]Okay.
[197:47.43]Okay.
[197:49.21]Okay.
[197:53.94]Just ban links?
[197:55.32]They are officially banned.
[197:57.48]Alright, let me get this again.
[198:09.38]How do I even hit that that way?
[198:10.80]I hit it backwards.
[198:11.68]How do I hit the ball behind me?
[198:23.21]I'm sitting... I'm standing sideways.
[198:26.79]I'm hitting... How am I hitting it to... It doesn't make any sense.
[198:29.96]Oh, he's a real pull hitter.
[198:41.38]It's hard.
[198:41.96]The analog is kind of annoying to hold.
[198:43.23]Don't worry.
[199:07.22]Oh, I can't do it in a video game.
[199:09.46]He can't hit the ball in a video game.
[199:10.98]See me in real life.
[199:12.24]See me in real life when I fucking got a real bat in my hand.
[199:14.78]And I can do it.
[199:16.28]Just watch.
[199:16.70]I'll prove it.
[199:17.14]I'll do it somewhere.
[199:17.92]I'll do a batting cage for him.
[199:20.37]And you guys are going to be like, holy shit.
[199:21.61]I take back everything I've ever said about this guy.
[199:39.64]That doesn't even happen in real life.
[200:01.81]That doesn't happen in real life.
[200:03.53]Plus, I'm not like standing behind the person actually hitting the ball.
[200:07.19]It's me hitting the ball.
[200:09.25]Now that wasn't an out.
[200:09.91]That was a grab ball right up the middle with the pitcher's legs.
[200:20.13]How am I swinging so early?
[200:36.99]I gotta go do the advanced course.
[200:38.29]That's the problem.
[200:38.91]They're going too slow.
[200:39.75]Why the fuck is that early?
[200:48.70]The ball is about to go by me.
[201:06.96]the game I'm not done I'm not done I'm not done I'm not done I'm just gonna walk up to the cashier I'm gonna pull a wad of hundred dollar bills out of my hand and just smash it down on the counter and go just keep the extra I don't care don't let anybody else in here for an hour
[201:40.80]Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
[201:46.36]We're so slow.
[201:53.74]It's gone.
[201:54.69]Gone, gone.
[201:55.77]Gone.
[202:00.33]Oops.
[202:32.29]Do the advanced one.
[202:34.31]I will.
[202:34.79]Just hold on.
[202:37.59]I gotta load the bases first.
[202:40.69]Here we go.
[202:41.87]Load the bases up.
[202:49.84]Curveball doesn't go 60 miles per hour.
[202:51.72]It goes like fucking 78.
[202:52.56]There it is.
[203:02.28]Base is loaded.
[203:02.78]Let's go home run.
[203:03.32]Grand slam.
[203:03.66]Let's do it.
[203:08.79]Fuck you.
[203:09.39]I didn't see it.
[203:10.67]Why do I... Okay, another problem is when you're playing baseball, I don't like turn my entire body and look at the sky to try to hit a home run.
[203:31.15]Get the fuck out of here, Grand Slam.

[204:13.59]How about you do that?
[204:14.59]Like in your own free time.
[204:26.48]There it is.
[204:27.00]Alright.
[204:27.34]Let's load it up.
[204:28.36]Go for a home run right now.

[206:40.98]It's alright.
[206:42.30]We'll do the hard one.
[206:51.46]Advance.
[206:55.54]We're about to pass the old record.
[206:59.08]Oh, there is a home run up top.
[207:08.77]This will be interesting.
[207:09.43]Let's see if I can get it.

[208:19.05]Let me get in there.
[208:21.67]The dad gets a bat that's way too short for him.
[208:24.55]Way too light.
[208:26.19]Like a t-ball bat.
[208:27.13]He just wants to get in there and just rip.
[208:32.03]He swings as hard as he can.
[208:34.05]Completely off timing and throws his whole back out.

[214:36.31]I told you I was going to be in longer.
[214:37.43]Here I am.
[214:38.57]I have one minute.
[214:51.54]What's this place?
[214:52.82]Oh, the batting center.
[214:55.29]I walk into it.
[214:55.99]What is that?
[214:56.41]Where am I?
[214:57.05]I guess I could hit a few balls.
[215:04.00]Let me do a mission.
[215:14.28]Where's my hideout?
[215:19.42]Because I kind of want to go there.
[215:26.18]Pink dot is the hideout?
[215:29.57]It's not unlocked.
[215:30.45]Oh, okay.
[215:40.97]It's him.
[215:42.17]Oh, it is me.
[215:42.84]Let's go.
[215:43.44]Random encounter.
[215:46.28]Play bingo?
[215:49.20]Maybe in a minute.
[215:57.57]One, two, three, four.
[216:00.03]Punch.
[216:12.19]I just kicked him right in the face.
[216:18.50]What's the deal with this guy?
[216:19.64]You attacked me.
[216:20.50]Why would I have a deal when you're the one that confronts me?
[216:25.32]You're the one with the deal.
[216:40.37]Am I going to stream the game awards?
[216:43.44]Oh, when are they?
[216:44.38]Yeah, when are they?
[216:47.58]That's soon, right?
[216:52.92]10th?
[216:54.76]Yeah, sure.
[216:55.98]If I can, definitely.
[216:58.99]You gonna get DMCA'd?
[217:00.83]Will we?
[217:02.95]Oh.
[217:03.79]Whatever, I'll just mute when music comes on.
[217:05.79]Yeah.
[217:13.88]That should be fine.
[217:15.32]Oh yeah, I gotta tell him what happened.
[217:17.10]Yeah.
[217:43.63]Tell him you lost 6 million at the baseball game?
[217:47.15]No, you don't tell people that.
[217:50.67]You don't lead with that. ...
[218:14.41]You keep that to yourself.
[218:30.72]I love Bingo.
[218:32.36]Bingo is like so much fun.
[218:34.22]It really is.
[218:35.70]It's so easy.
[218:36.44]You just have to sit there and listen and win sometimes.
[218:39.04]I should head home.
[218:40.46]Okay.
[219:00.20]Walk north through the hotel district.
[219:11.01]When you start liking bingo, that's how you know you're getting old.
[219:15.56]You're old.
[219:15.96]I mean, I liked it before.
[219:17.94]I did.
[219:19.86]What the hell is this?
[219:29.69]Yeah, you seem to think you can just walk by me without a word.
[219:31.99]This dude is huge!
[219:40.02]I'm not here to ch- Oh my god!
[219:47.03]So this is a shakedown.
[219:48.15]You should pick your targets better.
[219:49.41]I don't have a single yen for chumps like you.
[220:00.59]Mr. Shakedown?
[220:04.30]That's this guy's name?
[220:07.96]What the fuck?
[220:08.70]Does he just grab you and take money from your pocket?
[220:16.57]Oh shit, I just lost $285,000.
[220:17.39]What?
[220:17.49]What just happened?
[220:32.47]You're not half bad.
[220:33.63]I'll let you off the hook this time.
[220:35.41]What?
[220:37.43]If I'm having trouble with somebody like you, I need to change my training regimen.
[220:40.34]Time to bump up the intensity.
[220:45.00]What should I have shaking down to do?
[220:46.62]I'm just Mr. X. Hey, you okay, man?
[220:54.53]Hey, you just had the misfortune of meeting Hiroya Higashira.
[221:01.74]Mr. Shakedown, they call him.
[221:03.58]Mr. Shakedown?
[221:05.24]Yeah, he'll go after anybody that crosses his path, and then he takes everything they have.
[221:09.51]You seem like you can hold your own in a fight, but that guy's on a whole different level.
[221:13.83]If he sets his sights on you, you run for it.
[221:18.61]He takes all your money?
[221:19.56]I wish somebody could come along and beat all that stolen money out of him.
[221:27.08]Did he get you?
[221:29.57]Oh, great.
[221:29.79]If you lose to Mr. Shakedown in battle, he'll take all the money you have.
[222:00.26]If you can beat Mr. Shakedown, you reclaim all the money he steals from you.
[222:07.41]What?
[222:15.37]Okay.
[222:20.66]So, how do I deposit money?
[222:22.76]Oh, I got a tissue.
[222:27.14]Oh, just throw it away.
[222:34.93]You don't.
[222:38.43]You there.
[222:38.89]Wait, is it him?
[222:42.14]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[222:42.98]It's just one guy.
[222:45.46]This is not Mr. Shakedown.
[222:55.11]Spend it on ability.
[222:56.13]Right.
[222:56.41]Yep.
[223:10.78]Get out of here.
[223:13.90]You cannot take what you invest.
[223:16.60]Fuck, I had like $12 million.
[223:18.92]God damn it.
[223:24.78]Alright, hold on.
[223:25.34]Let me take a break.
[223:25.78]I'm going to get some water.
[223:27.59]I'm going to go pee.
[223:28.87]I'll be back in like 2-3 minutes.
[223:30.41]Be right back.
[223:37.79]Here comes artwork.
[227:28.21]What do we got?
[227:28.61]How do you have the photos?
[227:33.94]How are they?
[227:40.45]Crap, with a gun?
[228:02.75]More Jojo?
[228:05.81]No Catboy.
[228:10.11]Bad ad game.
[228:13.71]No Catboy this time.
[228:26.18]Alright, let's continue.
[228:27.22]Head back to the game.
[228:31.54]So I am going to tell you guys something that I probably am only going to stream for like another hour.
[228:35.26]At least it was more than four hours.
[228:46.09]And then I may, I'm trying to kind of gauge those of you that weren't here.
[228:49.25]I want to make sure people know this.
[228:52.59]Um, I've been getting sick.
[228:56.32]As of this kind of past weekend, I started like on like Saturday or so Sunday, I started getting a little scratchy.
[229:03.82]And then I'm kind of stuffy.
[229:06.86]So I took a bunch of precautions.
[229:09.48]I took a COVID test.
[229:11.72]And I want to really just kind of make sure that I kind of err on the side of complete caution here.
[229:17.60]So I'm sort of awaiting that.
[229:25.47]I don't have the... I don't know.
[229:26.53]I don't have the results yet.
[229:30.25]So, just want to obviously let everybody know that I'm okay.
[229:35.96]But, yeah.
[229:37.22]That's pretty much it.
[229:37.88]Hey, gamers.
[229:42.74]So tomorrow I'll... The next like probably three or four plus days are going to be sort of erratic.
[229:48.96]I might stream one day and then two days or one day and then one day, one day off, one day on.
[229:53.85]We'll kind of see how it goes.
[229:55.63]But I'm okay right now.
[229:59.11]We'll see.
[230:02.61]Let's go back to the game.
[230:07.76]That was cute.
[230:11.71]Ratatouille.
[230:18.73]Adorable.
[230:19.47]There's no, uh, camera?
[230:21.99]Fuck.
[230:23.80]Okay, good.
[230:25.90]The light is on, like it's being recorded.
[230:28.44]Freaked me out for a sec.
[230:34.80]So what can I do with this stuff?
[230:39.43]Just drink the milk?
[230:42.55]That's all it does?
[230:43.19]Just eat it.
[230:48.12]Just eat everything.
[230:48.70]Alright, let's go.
[230:55.82]What was something else I could do?
[230:57.02]Let me do the quest.
[230:59.42]And let me spend this money so I don't... Hold on.
[231:04.23]Yeah.
[231:05.51]Before I lose it all gambling.
[231:08.93]Regular attacks and heat actions.
[231:10.27]Yes.
[231:10.35]Yes.
[231:17.93]30 million.
[231:18.31]2 million.
[231:21.80]A mighty knee from low stance.
[231:25.92]More health.
[231:27.28]Oh, wait.
[231:29.50]Reduces the amount of heat loss when you take damage.
[231:31.70]That's pretty good.
[231:34.94]And reduces the heat dropping over time.
[231:37.78]Probably this one.
[231:39.82]Should I do more health?
[231:40.72]I'm doing this one.
[231:43.13]So you don't lose a lot of heat when you take damage.
[231:44.85]I like it.
[231:45.15]I like it.
[231:51.11]Anything else for like 400?
[231:51.71]OK.
[231:51.83]Increase the power of your regular attacks.
[232:02.09]Yeah.
[232:08.65]Go to the disco.
[232:09.41]Alright, I will go to the disco right now and then I'm going to do the mission.
[232:14.45]Or vice versa.
[232:14.97]Alright, I'm going to do the mission and then I'm going to do the disco.
[232:16.69]I gotta change my clothes.
[232:40.37]Karaoke, karaoke, karaoke.
[232:43.07]Maybe soon, maybe.
[232:45.20]Look at my eye.
[232:45.72]My eye.
[233:03.14]I can change clothes in here, right?
[233:04.12]I can put the clown outfit on.
[233:06.36]Fuck, hold on.
[233:07.22]Get out of my eye.
[233:14.77]Oh, damn it.
[233:16.59]I'm going to laugh every time I see it.
[233:26.31]Hey, grab me a couple of cigarettes out of the fridge.
[233:29.87]Those both for you.
[233:30.59]What about me?
[233:31.92]What the fuck?
[233:33.94]Yeah.
[233:45.07]Oh, beer.
[233:45.27]Uh.
[234:10.29]Weirdly cluttered.
[234:11.61]The table, you got a lot of real estate.
[234:13.99]Not using a whole lot of it.
[234:14.93]Thank you so much for not being obnoxious and talking through all the cutscenes like you did last time.
[234:41.84]I think I'm doing that.
[234:42.83]I'm doing that right now.
[234:43.67]Fuck.
[234:45.27]Alright.
[234:45.53]I'll be quiet. ...
[235:10.85]You can talk?
[235:11.91]Did this guy not eat?
[235:14.77]What are those bottles over there?
[235:17.87]There's like four bottles on the table.
[235:22.70]I want this guy to eat.
[235:41.85]I'll turn it up.
[235:50.88]There's ramen on the table.
[235:51.78]Yeah, we're playing poker with Oreos.
[235:53.38]He's lost every single round.
[235:56.34]We're not old enough to play with money.
[235:58.30]So we use chips, Oreos, sticks, and food pieces. ...
[236:10.76]They're all beers on the table.
[236:11.86]Yeah.
[236:38.57]They're unopened.
[236:39.37]Right.
[236:40.35]That's true.
[236:40.89]They are unopened.
[237:04.28]I have those same wrinkles on my eyebrows.
[237:05.75]The exact same ones.
[237:07.29]Just look at any picture of my face.
[237:08.47]I'm straight on.
[237:42.38]The face cam.
[237:43.00]No, I'm like sick.
[237:44.10]I'm not going to put the face.
[237:45.32]I'm like pale and dirty.
[237:49.36]I'm like dirty.
[237:50.30]No, I'm too dirty.
[237:51.20]No.
[237:51.44]Yeah.
[238:05.71]Dirty is good.
[238:07.30]No, it's not.
[238:08.12]Clean and prepared.
[238:10.54]I...
[238:30.69]Prepared for what?
[238:32.26]I don't know.
[238:32.92]For the day.
[238:33.50]For the world.
[238:34.14]For you.
[238:35.24]For me.
[238:35.70]For everything.
[238:42.34]Okay.
[238:42.52]Here's our tweet for what just happened.
[238:46.82]Maybe Nishiki's right.
[238:48.10]And I should accept Tachibana's offer.
[238:51.00]But I need more to go on before I can trust him.
[238:55.02]Here we go.
[238:55.66]There's our lore tweet.
[238:57.87]I should hit the town to see what I can find out about him.
[239:04.35]Who's laughing?
[239:07.73]Oh, that's a crow.
[239:08.55]I just hear it like... Alright, I'm so... I'm just going to pick that herb up on the ground and use it for health.
[239:39.03]Final Fantasy laugh?
[239:53.81]What's the guy that laughs really loudly?
[239:55.15]And um... What's his name?
[239:58.40]No, not Tobin Bell.
[240:00.52]That's the actor from Saw.
[240:02.54]What's his name?
[240:04.71]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[240:06.65]Titus, right.
[240:11.55]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[240:19.12]Knockout.
[240:27.50]Gaslight him.
[240:28.12]Let's gaslight him.
[240:34.57]We have a disco club.
[240:37.00]Disco club.
[240:38.02]Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco.
[240:41.60]I'm ready for the disco.
[240:42.54]Let's do it.
[240:45.12]I'm going to the middle of the day.
[240:46.28]Is it up top?
[240:49.89]Where is it?
[240:58.45]You thought Christopher Walken and Tobin Bell were the same person.
[241:06.81]I mean, I don't... I guess I can kind of... sort of see that.
[241:14.23]But not in their voice.
[241:16.15]I mean, I don't know.
[241:20.20]Here you go.
[241:22.26]I've got... I got a million dollars.
[241:24.18]I'm a millionaire.
[241:25.78]I can go in here whenever I want.
[241:26.98]Enjoy your time at the Maharaja.
[241:36.17]Although Saw would have probably been a lot more interesting, I guess, with Christopher Walken as Saw.
[241:40.50]It would have been weird.
[241:44.78]What can I do?
[241:45.24]These dance moves.
[241:57.69]This is like I'm playing in a puddle.
[242:05.28]Okay, let's go.
[242:08.48]I request talk to people 50 times.
[242:12.99]Yeah, about the disco.
[242:16.55]To dance at the disco, press buttons in rhythm with a song.
[242:19.71]Use up, down, left, right, left, right, up, down, B, A, start to move your character's avatar to the square with the next input icon.
[242:26.46]Then press the corresponding button when it's there.
[242:30.66]As you move your avatar, you'll see the number of steps it takes, okay?
[242:34.48]The more steps you take, the more points you will get for the correct input.
[242:38.24]Try to take as many steps as you can on your way to the next input.
[242:43.13]Huh.
[242:45.19]You can't- squares marked as already stepped on won't be counted again.
[242:48.67]In the upper middle of the screen is the fever gauge.
[242:52.13]Press the left trigger when it's full to trigger dancing fever.
[242:56.25]New screen with a series of button input will appear.
[242:58.09]Press them with the correct timing to boost your score.
[243:03.42]The voltage gauge at the upper right shows how impressed the audience is with your dancing.
[243:08.66]It directly affects what rating you get, so build up your score to fill the gauge.
[243:12.42]You get just four levels.
[243:13.36]Each level earns you another star towards your final dance rating.
[243:18.07]I don't know why I'm laughing.
[243:18.89]It's just funny.
[243:19.95]There is also a versus mode in which you can compete with another dancer the moment the higher score wins.

[245:38.64]I just got booed off the stage.
[245:45.67]Well, sorry, I have to move the little guy around the screen and press A at the right time.
[245:52.47]I thought I was going to be moving around the guy and dancing.

[247:36.71]It's too hard to move around that fast.
[247:44.95]It's not even me dancing, it's me mashing my buttons until I can get to the right spot and press A.

[250:07.85]Cool.
[250:08.63]That's alright.
[250:16.28]At least I can go to the next level in the iPad game.
[250:18.14]I don't care.

[251:05.82]See this dance floor?
[251:07.04]It's my playground.
[251:07.92]And I've been watching you dance, friend.
[251:11.16]That's when it hit me.
[251:12.32]You've got a talent for dancing that's off the scale.
[251:16.96]What?
[251:17.12]There's no fooling me, but I wouldn't mind seeing it up again up close.
[251:24.48]I challenge you to a battle.
[251:25.64]Wait, you want to fight me?
[251:28.63]No, a dance battle.
[251:32.75]Alright, I'm going to do it one more time.
[251:36.83]We're going to dance battle this guy.
[251:46.95]How can you not know about dance battles?
[251:49.67]Unbelievable.
[251:54.83]You're a Neanderthal.
[251:58.71]I think this twit wants to fight me.
[252:00.57]Okay.
[252:06.14]Two dancers dance to the same song to see who's better.
[252:15.34]Both dancers show their stuff.
[252:16.52]The audience reaction determines the winner.
[252:17.98]Alright, I get the picture.
[252:19.08]Great.
[252:20.06]You catch on quick for a caveman.
[252:21.42]Let's not waste any time then.
[252:23.54]Let's hit the floor.
[252:25.90]You looking for a drink in your face?
[252:27.00]Why are you doing this?
[252:30.82]Dancing's awesome because you can get down and boogie any time.
[252:38.43]Let's go.
[252:39.85]Alright, I'm going to be good on this one.
[252:40.79]I swear to God.
[252:41.19]I'm going to be so good on this.
[252:43.27]You have no idea.
[252:48.45]Oh, it has to be Friday night.
[252:58.76]Alright, buddy.
[253:01.90]It's time for me to do the thing that I say I don't or whatever.
[253:11.45]Oh, those are your moves.
[253:12.57]Those are bad.
[253:13.61]Alright, let's kick his ass.
[253:20.15]Metaphorically.
[253:56.28]What the fuck are you talking about?!
[253:58.00]Fever!
[254:05.11]I- I'm sorry, I'm using an Xbox controller.
[254:08.69]And, as you all know, the Xbox controller is wonderful because, like, when you press one button, like, up on the Xbox controller, it hits every fucking button on your entire controller and your keyboard.
[254:18.02]It clicks your mouse buttons, too.
[254:41.00]I still win.
[254:41.99]Push this guy off the stage.
[254:44.11]Let's Tekken this motherfucker and just eliminate him.
[254:46.43]Just push him off.
[254:47.97]A virtual fighter.
[254:48.73]Whatever the SEGA game was.
[254:49.79]It's the same company.
[254:50.59]Who cares?
[254:50.95]Hmm.
[255:12.00]SEGA made Virtua Fighter.
[255:14.78]They made this game too, that's what I meant.
[255:19.77]Ha ha ha ha.
[255:28.31]Virtua Fighter 5 is in Yakuza.
[255:29.77]Is it actually in the game?
[255:31.33]That's pretty cool.
[255:31.83]I haven't danced like this in a long time.
[255:40.01]All thanks to you.
[255:43.04]What's wrong with that?
[255:44.46]After all, what else can we be?
[255:45.66]We danced wild.
[255:46.52]We danced hot.
[255:47.14]We danced together.
[255:48.08]Is that how it works?
[255:52.88]That's exactly how it works.
[255:54.32]I knew my eyes weren't deceiving me.
[255:55.71]You've got legit talent, my brother.
[255:58.97]Maybe, maybe you can even take him.
[256:01.63]Hmm?
[256:04.96]Oh, me and my big mouth.
[256:06.48]Just forget you heard a word, brother.
[256:08.50]Nothing to do with you yet.
[256:09.38]Okay.
[256:12.09]Oh, hey, I don't think I ever caught your name.
[256:15.27]Oh, you went with the real name first.
[256:16.95]Big mistake.
[256:17.53]Should have said, like, Dave.
[256:28.12]Whatever.
[256:30.84]Alright, I have to go.
[256:31.46]I'll be looking forward to hitting the dance floor again with you.
[256:33.80]Who's this?
[256:35.80]New character?
[256:36.32]That boy.
[256:40.96]Kiryu.
[256:41.40]He's good.
[256:42.84]But maybe not quite at my level yet.
[256:51.87]Oh.

[256:57.83]Get me out.
[256:58.11]I don't want to do this again.

[257:05.24]A round of drinks for everybody.
[257:08.02]Yeah!
[257:09.36]You heard it here from the dance king.
[257:11.14]That's me.
[257:13.78]They start bringing out the bottles.
[257:14.94]Serve it.
[257:15.30]Serve every table.
[257:23.87]Where's the exit?
[257:27.61]Where's the exit?
[257:28.27]I don't know how to get out of here.
[257:33.02]No, I don't want to get the whole thing because I didn't want to have the bill.
[257:35.56]Alright, let's go this way.
[257:38.50]No, this is the bar.
[257:39.56]Oh, shit.

[271:50.63]Okay, let's try it.
[271:52.67]Press X to go near a large weapon showing a mark to automatically pick it up and swing it.
[271:56.27]This is called an auto weapon attack.
[271:58.99]Bash an enemy with an auto weapon attack.
[272:00.49]Okay, let's see.
[272:22.05]Where is it?
[272:27.50]Oh, use X. Get outta here.
[272:31.64]Use X. Oh, that's not a beast weapon.
[272:53.06]Alright, is there anything else bigger?
[272:57.34]Withstand the enemy attacks.
[273:00.50]Holding LT to guard lets you withstand enemy attacks with the resist guard.
[273:04.00]You'll take a certain amount of damage, but you are protected against attacks from any direction.
[273:07.10]That's cool.
[273:09.00]Okay.
[273:14.76]Use B-style moves to pulverize the back pack of cows.
[273:20.62]The dodge roll now?
[273:21.60]That's cool.
[273:34.24]Nice dropkick.
[273:43.64]I'm so fucking mad.
[273:49.33]Pick them up by their legs.
[273:50.31]That's so awesome.
[273:57.85]Yeah.
[274:01.33]What is this guy?
[274:02.83]All of us beating on him.
[274:04.13]And it's like he doesn't even feel it.
[274:07.32]You want more?
[274:07.82]No, I'm leaving.
[274:10.72]I'm not leaving until at least I punch that bitch.
[274:14.38]Well, I... Hold on.
[274:18.99]Well, if it isn't Porky's little friends I saw you boys crawl into the bar last night.
[274:24.90]Ah.
[274:26.34]I must be hearing things because it sounded like you said something about punching me out.
[274:30.66]If you're interested, this bitch is ready to go.
[274:32.66]No, no, no.
[274:35.46]That's just crazy.
[274:36.20]What kind of man would do that?
[274:38.67]And with a group?
[274:39.79]That's pathetic.
[274:43.21]Right.
[274:43.67]Now pick up that sad sack line over there and get the hell out of my sight.
[274:48.60]I got what I came here for.
[274:49.71]Got no use for him now.
[274:52.79]Yes, ma'am.
[274:57.62]Mr. Satan?
[274:58.94]No, it's not.
[275:01.00]Nothing, everything that is low is not Mr. Satan.
[275:07.87]is it it's not everything it's not Mr. Satan this is not Mr. Satan this is this is how you know yeah it's like a hidden camera TV show where they got the person completely blacked out with a silhouette yeah when I uh yeah that the crazy part is when I I watched him and when we're working at McDonald's yeah yeah no it's even lower it's like yeah
[275:33.64]My identity needs to be taken care of because I watched him pee into the coffee machine.
[275:40.18]And it was disgusting.
[275:41.34]We tried to make him stop.
[275:42.30]We tried to get rid of him.
[275:47.68]Our boss was just crazy.
[275:49.07]He was just fucking fucked up.
[275:52.59]Arthur?
[275:52.89]I want you to know something, Arthur.
[275:57.85]I do believe it's me and I don't know what you're saying, Arthur.
[276:02.93]I'm not doing this again.
[276:03.93]No, we're not doing this again.
[276:05.04]I'd rather do this.
[276:06.98]What is this bit?
[276:07.94]There is no bit.
[276:09.02]You've already seen it before.
[276:12.12]It returns.
[276:13.48]It returns.
[276:14.62]It's time to go back into this bit.
[276:17.35]If you remember this one from a few months ago, Goku.
[276:25.15]How do I get back to the game?
[276:30.13]I need a new trailer it's groundhog day no I'm not that we don't repeat material here except almost every day we do but you know whatever
[276:56.42]Name's Kiru.
[276:57.92]Kiru, huh?
[276:59.32]I'll remember the name.
[277:00.28]If you've got Bacchus singing your praises, you've got to be pretty tough.
[277:05.63]Yes.
[277:06.29]This boy's a future champion.
[277:07.88]I'd stake my career on him.
[277:10.41]Ah, okay.
[277:11.31]Now I'm seeing what this is.
[277:12.53]You're thinking Kiryu here is your ticket to a fat stack of cash.
[277:15.65]Which then you'll use to pay me back so we can get to stay friends.
[277:19.40]Easy, tiger.
[277:20.86]I told you it'll take a while, but you'll get it back.
[277:23.26]Ooh, speaking of favors.
[277:25.12]Why don't you train the boy here?
[277:29.28]Wait, this is like a table read for a TV show.
[277:31.67]I'm not even getting into this.
[277:35.57]The actor's not even doing the voice.
[277:36.87]They're doing like the halfway...
[277:40.02]Table read YouTube video.
[277:44.54]Yo, I seem like the patient teacher.
[277:46.14]And then they all laugh too.
[277:48.54]After like funny lines, even though they're saying them like on a halfway.
[277:53.94]Ah, don't be like that.
[277:55.28]We both needed to get stronger.
[277:58.86]Everyone starts laughing and we're like, they all have glasses on too.
[278:02.04]Every single person at the table has glasses on.
[278:05.90]We'll be rolling in dough.
[278:06.75]Besides, I know you're secretly the doting type.
[278:11.60]He'll make a champion a hell of a lot faster with you beating him into shape.
[278:14.78]That means you get paid sooner.
[278:16.30]See?
[278:16.56]Win-win.
[278:22.66]Bacchus.
[278:24.02]What do you think you're doing here, man?
[278:27.30]Negotiating an apprenticeship with Miss Tatsu for you.
[278:35.78]Sorry, sorry.
[278:39.03]Obviously, trust me.
[278:40.57]You train under her, you'll be master of the ring in no time flat.
[278:47.36]You're insane.
[278:48.22]I'm seriously in hot water right now.
[278:49.80]I don't have the time to humor your little fantasies.
[278:52.78]What?
[278:53.88]You're in hot water too, my boy?
[278:55.76]This is great.
[278:58.19]This is great.
[279:00.07]Are we talking knife in the ribs here?
[279:01.61]Because I warned you about that.
[279:05.29]I'll be lucky if that's all I get.
[279:06.43]And seriously, what's this obsession with me getting stabbed about?
[279:11.17]Alright, chuckleheads, that's enough.
[279:13.25]Neither one of you is making a damn bit of sense.
[279:17.36]Kiryu walks from stage left into the scene and gets swarmed by 25 enemies.
[279:23.34]Oh, shit.
[279:29.13]But I hear where you're coming from, Bacchus.
[279:30.63]Ditch the championship talk and just say you care about this Kiryu kid.
[279:34.82]If you're worried about him, own it.
[279:41.15]Look, you did me a solid a minute ago.
[279:42.71]What's on the floor over there?
[279:43.81]Oh, this is trash?
[279:47.45]The old man is right that my training will make a real man out of you.
[279:50.08]Hop a cab out to the pier sometime.
[279:54.20]I'll give you a training space there.
[279:56.74]You train at the pier?
[279:58.48]You got it.
[279:59.60]Kind of live that.
[280:00.48]I'm holding this paper still.
[280:01.46]Put it down.
[280:02.96]Pay me a visit sometime.
[280:03.92]See for yourself.
[280:04.40]I think you'll get the digs.
[280:07.14]Everyone looks over at me.
[280:07.92]Yeah, I've memorized the lines already.
[280:10.43]I don't need the fucking paper anymore.
[280:12.47]All you guys just show up like three days before rehearsal.
[280:14.89]No, fuck all of you.
[280:25.78]Bacchus, I've already got a future plan.
[280:27.04]I'm sorry, but I can't be your champion.
[280:29.02]What sport are we even talking about?
[280:30.36]Boxing?
[280:31.72]Not that it matters.
[280:32.42]I can't.
[280:32.78]That's a toxic theater kid.
[280:43.37]I know that.
[280:44.05]Doesn't mean I'll stop trying.
[280:46.65]But I know I want to stop making a nuisance of myself.
[280:49.42]I'll give you some space, champ.
[280:51.22]It's about time for my afternoon drink anyway.
[280:53.68]Help me clear my head.
[280:56.17]Good luck with that.
[280:57.03]Just don't have too many.
[280:59.37]You think a guy called Bacchus can't hold his wine?
[281:02.73]Ha!
[281:03.77]See you around, boy.
[281:04.49]And keep those ribs knife-free.
[281:08.31]Get out of here.
[281:09.57]Thanks.
[281:10.41]I'll be careful.
[281:15.26]I will.
[281:16.82]Thank you for hanging out with me this afternoon.
[281:22.20]Didn't expect to get wrapped up in that mess, but at least I didn't come away empty-handed.
[281:33.43]That is torn on who that is British Bernie Sanders I mean like Boris Johnson kind of is like sounds like that British Bernie What's going on?
[281:59.23]This is a rough looking crowd
[282:04.03]What do I have to do for this guy?
[282:08.09]Uh... Oi, um... Oi, oi.
[282:12.61]I'm so freakin' stoked, man.
[282:15.63]A rare street show, but you're gonna beat your silvers.
[282:20.14]Too right.
[282:21.20]Those guys are rock and roll gods.
[282:23.84]Look at this bitching crowd.
[282:25.94]They drew all these punks without any ads or any nothing at all.
[282:30.83]It's crazy.
[282:31.93]It's crazy.
[282:37.41]This must be street documentary voice.
[282:40.45]It's not documentary voice.
[282:44.81]They're all Boris Johnson.
[282:51.26]It's not Nigel Thornberry.
[282:52.84]What?
[282:53.06]What?
[282:56.34]How do you get Boris Johnson and Nigel Thornberry mixed up?
[283:03.50]Keep your pants on, but I heard the Yokomichi Silvers are heading for a Q&A panel.
[283:09.31]No effing way.
[283:10.15]They're famous for never saying a word and letting their music do the talking?
[283:14.11]I wonder what the hell they're talking about.
[283:22.49]Sounds like some band's doing an event here.
[283:24.87]Must be popular with the local punks.
[283:27.49]Hmm.
[283:32.75]Oh, fuck.
[283:33.65]Oops.
[283:34.40]Wait, can you... Is it coming through twice?
[283:36.82]It might... No, no.
[283:41.38]Theater Square.
[283:42.10]Alright, so... Save the game.
[283:44.80]Oh, there's a quest marker over here.
[283:47.91]Quest, quest, quest, quest.

[284:20.85]I love so much how everybody fucking hates this.
[284:35.23]It's giving me energy right now.
[284:40.01]Oh, sure.
[284:46.56]wait a second could you possibly be unaware of who I am are you asking me if we met before we bumped into each other if we did I don't recognize you oh wait a second then so you really don't know who I am oh willikers what a relief I'm so sorry I was rude don't not do true my name's kill my stage name is crazy kill I'm the vocalist in a band
[285:14.39]Let me guess, the Yokimitsu Silvers.
[285:19.28]Same band these young punks are excited to see.
[285:21.42]Aren't you guys some kind of legendary Yankee band?
[285:24.02]Someone in chat just gave you $100 to fuck off.
[285:30.76]What?
[285:32.44]I don't read bits anymore.
[285:35.84]What is it?
[285:36.68]Vilemi gave $100.
[285:37.77]Jerma, I will pay you to never do this voice ever again.
[285:40.25]Well, you did it before.
[285:41.05]I agreed to that.
[285:43.86]So now I'm going to read your message in the voice that you didn't want, that you paid to stop.
[286:03.87]He's a scumbag.
[286:04.91]No, thanks.
[286:05.79]You can't pay me to do anything.
[286:07.47]I'll never accept money to do something.
[286:09.17]I'll never require it.
[286:22.51]even hardcore in the slightest no as a joke we tried dressing all punk at a show to our shock we got pretty popular with the yankee crowd but now we have to keep up this charade full time over time we gained a fan base of wannabe punks and the yoko michi silvers became heroes to the rebellious new youth of Japan little style is called yankee now okay uh there's more to running a band than I thought
[286:46.87]So, what do you mean by me saving you?
[286:50.39]I, um, actually... Now I know why this game is 80 hours long.
[286:53.46]I figured it out.
[286:56.34]I see.
[286:57.56]I want you to teach me how to be a hardcore hooligan.
[287:02.34]Teach you to be a Yankee?
[287:04.88]Yes, you see, for today's event, we also have to do a live panel.
[287:09.04]A meet and greet for the fans.
[287:11.90]Every member of the Yokimichi Silvers, myself included, are law-abiding choir boys we've never even shoplifted.
[287:20.92]If we were to talk in front of the real Yankee, they'd realize that we're phonies.
[287:25.56]Fake punks, eh?
[287:27.07]Now that you mention it, the way you talk doesn't match how you dress at all.
[287:33.13]You are a choir boy.
[287:34.84]Right?
[287:35.10]So if we spoke to our fans, we'd lose all our credibility and popularity in an instant.
[287:40.44]Or worse, what if they want revenge on us for fooling them?
[287:48.13]Okay, but do you have to do this panel thing?
[287:49.63]Why don't you just skip it?
[287:51.95]I don't want to do it either, but our agency says we need to hone our speaking skills.
[287:55.91]We want to stay popular.
[287:56.83]They're making us do this.
[288:02.07]you know when you're in line for the ride at like Disney world or universal studios and you're just sitting there in line watching the videos and it's like an hour and a half watching the videos in line and then you get onto the ride and the ride is like three minutes long and you're like holy that was fun and then you kind of get in line for another ride and you watch the videos again I feel like this is this game
[288:29.88]Like, I'm in line at the ride.
[288:31.94]And then we actually fight people.
[288:34.84]Like, I get to be on fucking Back to the Future for two minutes.
[288:45.75]So you want me to teach you how to behave like a Yankee?
[288:51.63]He hates it.
[288:52.31]No, I don't.
[288:53.15]I don't.
[289:01.91]I don't hate this.
[289:07.00]When did I say I hated the Back to the Future ride line experience?
[289:10.28]I never said that.
[289:10.86]I just said that's what it reminds me of.
[289:21.80]You implied it.
[289:22.46]No, I didn't.
[289:22.82]I said, you know what this reminds me of?
[289:24.72]You can teach us.
[289:28.52]Okay, teach me how to be... Don't...
[289:37.22]He hates Back to the Future.
[289:38.42]This is not... How much do you like lines, then?
[289:47.61]You heavily implied it.
[289:50.93]Do you love to watch the theme park videos before the ride?
[289:53.25]Yes, I do, because it fills me in.
[289:55.67]And I get to see stuff that I've never seen before.
[289:58.46]That's content you don't get to see unless you go to the ride.
[290:03.47]Or, I mean, maybe, like, on, like, the special features of the DVD, they might put it on there.
[290:07.50]Alright, let's do it.
[290:26.25]Okie dokie.
[290:27.49]Give me a second, please.
[290:29.49]Okay.
[290:31.33]They're back.
[290:32.37]Sorry to keep you waiting.
[290:38.99]This is our drummer, Sleazy Tarashi.
[290:43.91]Hey, I'm Tarashi.
[290:46.77]My stage name is Sleazy, but I have no experience with the ladies.
[290:49.32]Never even seen a boo.
[290:51.46]This is our bassist, Bad Boy Aku.
[290:56.42]I'm Aku, hobbies caring for elders.
[290:58.80]This is Kirusan.
[291:00.47]He's going to impart the ways of true Yankee style hooliganism onto us.
[291:05.33]Please teach us.
[291:06.07]Okay.
[291:09.74]Am I going to beat the shit out of them?
[291:10.76]How can I show you how to be tougher?
[291:38.19]Maybe you could come up with an opening remark for little old me?
[291:40.47]Okay.
[291:44.16]I want to kick off our panel with authority.
[291:45.90]Being hooligans, we shouldn't come across as weak or hesitant.
[291:50.00]I need a zinger.
[291:52.30]Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today.
[291:53.68]Start your engines.
[291:54.50]Hello, but in English.
[291:55.58]How about opening with a hello, but it's in English?
[292:01.19]English?
[292:01.75]Do you really think so?
[292:02.45]I mean, a hooligan speaking English.
[292:05.33]Is that Yankee style?
[292:08.42]I think it would be just right for a Yankee.
[292:09.93]Young rebels fall hard for what's cool, and English is the language of rock and roll.
[292:13.59]Okay.
[292:17.03]Think about it.
[292:17.87]Their hero, the vocalist of the Yokomichi Silvers, speaks a language they don't know.
[292:21.55]They can't help but be impressed by his worldliness.
[292:26.62]Do I have to keep speaking English afterwards?
[292:28.24]That's going to be a challenge.
[292:30.46]I only know a few greetings.
[292:33.52]Same goes for them, though.
[292:34.40]If you sound like you know what you're saying, you can get away with it.
[292:38.58]Do we get to watch this?
[292:41.34]Rock and roll.
[292:45.20]What is it?
[292:46.68]Well, the agency told me to tell the fans about how I spend my days off when I'm not rehearsing or performing.
[292:53.16]Days off, huh?
[292:54.52]Makes sense that fans would want to know their heroes live from day to day.
[292:58.25]How the heroes live.
[292:59.89]Terashia, how would you spend a day off?
[293:03.07]I make a habit of getting up bright and early so I can make some pancakes.
[293:06.22]After breakfast, I take my darling puppy, Chibi-Chan, to the park for a mid-morning stroll.
[293:11.62]And then we have lunch at Chick Cafe to rest our feet.
[293:15.64]On our way home, we do little window shopping.
[293:17.82]After that, I binge on the dramas.
[293:20.17]I've... This is when I, like, make my phone do a fucking ringtone.
[293:25.13]And be like, oh, yeah, yeah, alright, okay, I gotta take this.
[293:27.49]See you later, guys.
[293:30.23]You just described a typical girl's day.
[293:34.81]Oh, sorry.
[293:36.47]That really made you sound like a fashionable young woman.
[293:39.01]I was so surprised.
[293:39.71]I got intense.
[293:43.27]I'm so scared.
[293:45.82]Oh, no, Kira-san.
[293:46.80]You shouldn't shout like that.
[293:48.68]You made Sleazy Tarashi cry.
[293:50.26]That's a bit much, don't you think?
[293:54.26]Oh, dear.
[293:54.96]Sniffle.
[293:56.69]You should say sorry.
[294:01.85]Yeah, my bad.
[294:04.07]it's it's alright I was just startled I wasn't expecting it is all sniffles so how about I spend a day off how should I spend how should I do it this kind of sounds like butthead right there one thing's clear you can't tell the fans how you really spend your free time no I guess not but then what should I say what would I be doing instead
[294:34.10]That's kind of ordinary, isn't it?
[294:47.29]I mean, I already do that pretty regularly.
[294:49.76]Think about it.
[294:50.54]Punks are people, too.
[294:52.12]On their days off, even they would want to spend it with their friends.
[294:55.08]Ever notice them squatting together in parking lots?
[295:00.08]That's true.
[295:00.54]I see them loitering around, like you say, but are they really friends?
[295:05.82]Oh, I used the wrong word.
[295:07.85]What's wrong?
[295:08.39]They're not friends.
[295:10.89]It should be mates.
[295:13.01]Mates, actually, when you put... Why are people running?
[295:15.03]You see on your days off, you hang out with your mates.
[295:23.73]Actually, you and your mates just shoot the shit with each other.
[295:26.19]Say that and you'll be fine.
[295:28.76]I kind of get it.
[295:29.36]I'm not sure what that actually means, but hanging out with mates sounds totally what hooligans would do.
[295:35.38]Now, what do you want?
[295:37.68]You're a bad boy Aku, right?
[295:39.48]What's the matter?
[295:41.48]What should I say?
[295:42.20]Uh, you didn't get a topic like Tarashi.
[295:46.45]No.
[295:48.15]The agency told him to wing it.
[295:49.31]He's free to talk about whatever.
[295:51.55]Even though he's practically mute.
[295:54.15]Bad Boy Aku even has a backstory.
[295:56.23]Locked up in juvenile reformatories from birth, Bad Boy Aku crushed packs of punks before he even finished preschool.
[296:04.86]Your agency's trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.
[296:09.16]Man, a few words, the crazy backstory.
[296:10.82]What should he talk about to make him sound hardcore?
[296:17.45]Nothing at all.
[296:22.25]Anything be better if you just stay quiet?
[296:25.46]Stay silent during the panel?
[296:27.18]Wouldn't a discussion without any talking be a disaster?
[296:30.16]Yeah.
[296:31.50]Nope.
[296:32.40]Aku was told he's free to talk about whatever he wants.
[296:34.32]That means he's also free not to talk at all.
[296:38.07]That's true, but... It would be worse if he were to say the wrong things and wreck his image.
[296:43.41]From Aku's backstory, I think he would seem more hardcore if he kept his mouth shut.
[296:46.69]Yeah.
[296:49.39]You put it that way, it makes total sense.
[296:51.75]Okay, we'll do that.
[296:52.39]Bad boy Aku stays speechless during his part.
[296:59.66]I can't get over it.
[297:00.34]Sure.
[297:00.66]Aku, are you good with that?
[297:01.72]Okay.
[297:04.37]Alright.
[297:04.71]Now we'll go over how you'll run this panel discussion.
[297:10.51]Yes, please.
[297:11.44]Oh, here we go.
[297:16.12]We're almost ready for your panel.
[297:26.38]I'll be watching from the audience.
[297:27.46]Let's see how we do.
[297:29.54]Yes, please watch us.
[297:30.60]We're going to hit this hardcore Yankee thing out of the park.
[297:32.91]We're going to kick ass and stuff.
[297:38.73]Alright, let's see it.
[297:40.33]Here they are.
[297:40.69]Put your hands together for the Yokomichi Silvers.
[297:49.52]Ooh, Krazy Kyosan.
[297:52.16]Bad boy Aku over here.
[297:54.08]Whoa, my God.
[297:55.01]Check out Krazy Kyosan's original ESP guitar smoking red.
[297:58.93]The man's got the Yankee look nailed.
[298:01.37]Oh, they are popular.
[298:05.61]And they're not talking.
[298:06.45]They do look like real greasers.
[298:10.69]Sopping wet high rock and roll after school.
[298:13.79]Tarashi Aku.
[298:14.68]Hit it, boys.
[298:24.37]That conclu- What?
[298:26.99]That concludes today's performance by the Yokimichi Silvers.
[298:30.23]Just listening to their songs, I can see why Yankee kids across Japan look up to Crazy Kyo's band.
[298:36.32]We'd like to move on to a special meet-and-greet panel discussion with the band members.
[298:41.58]Whoa, no way!
[298:45.40]Crazy Kyo-san's actually gonna talk to us?
[298:47.46]That's mental!
[298:49.40]I can't fucking wait to hear bad boy Aku's voice.
[298:54.19]Here's where it gets real.
[298:55.33]They better pull it off.
[298:57.53]Yo, grease hounds.
[299:00.39]Hello, everyone.
[299:01.65]Rock and roll.
[299:02.83]We are Yokio Michi Silvers.
[299:05.78]Holy shit.
[299:08.68]Crazy Kyokan can even speak English.
[299:11.00]That's so bitchin'.
[299:12.00]I'm going to totally... I'm going mental.
[299:15.04]My God, that totally authentic pronunciation.
[299:17.27]It drives me wild.
[299:19.05]I'm shitting bricks over here.
[299:22.08]I'm fine thank you and you yes the audience loves it using English was a good choice awesome thank you crazy kyo-san next we would like to hear from sleazy tarashi-san and the bad boy okusan as well first up sleazy tarashi-san here's a question we got from a fan how do you usually spend your days off
[299:50.30]If I get a day off, I mostly hang with my mates.
[299:52.54]We shoot the shit.
[299:54.98]Yeah, a guy like Tarashi-san must have a lot of mates.
[299:58.90]Tarashi-san, what do you do with your mates?
[300:04.07]We make pancakes.
[300:05.97]No!
[300:08.19]You ruined it.
[300:11.27]Oh, we don't just stay holed up at home.
[300:12.91]We go out and eat lunch at fancy cafes and stuff.
[300:15.94]Yeah.
[300:17.98]Who the fuck is this guy?
[300:19.12]Uh-oh.
[300:22.18]I should have covered more details.
[300:25.62]Oh, no.
[300:27.89]I have a bad boy Okusan to say something.
[300:30.05]Uh.
[300:39.76]Don't say anything.
[300:40.28]Hmm.
[300:45.34]That was it?
[300:46.80]No way.
[300:47.90]He just stood there for his whole panel discussion?
[300:50.20]That's... That's so hardcore.
[300:55.00]Yeah.
[300:55.42]Heh.
[300:56.56]Holy crap.
[300:57.40]Bad boy of Cousins.
[300:58.48]The coolest.
[300:59.04]What a rebel.
[301:00.32]He doesn't play by the rules.
[301:01.40]Not even his own rules.
[301:02.28]That's what makes him a bad boy.
[301:03.72]Oh, good.
[301:05.78]It was the right choice.
[301:08.30]After all, it doesn't take a big talk to make a big man.
[301:10.42]And Attitude speaks louder than words.
[301:13.80]Did I do it?
[301:24.18]Here's N. Were you watching?
[301:26.68]Yeah, I saw everything.
[301:28.52]Good work.
[301:30.58]Here's N. We tried to apply what we learned from you about the ways of the Yankee to our panel.
[301:35.16]Fan response is pretty darn good.
[301:36.96]I'm kind of shocked.
[301:37.96]Do I get money for this?
[301:40.81]It seemed that way.
[301:41.49]It was all worth the effort.
[301:43.17]I think we can keep the Yoku Michu silvers going without sagging.
[301:48.57]We're going to be fine.
[301:50.69]Thank you very much.
[301:52.24]You got a charismatic autobiography.
[301:53.94]That was the most fun I've ever had speaking in public.
[301:59.12]Hirasan, thanks.
[302:00.26]From now on, we're going to keep working hard to expand on what you taught us about the way of the Yankee.
[302:06.00]We'll work on our speaking skills, too.
[302:08.87]Keep an eye on us.
[302:13.34]The Yoko Michi silvers are going places.
[302:15.74]Just you watch.
[302:17.96]Yeah, give it your best shot.
[302:20.90]Do not equip the book.
[302:22.26]Please do not use the book.
[302:23.62]Don't use the book.
[302:24.30]Don't equip the book.
[302:24.96]Don't throw the book in the trash.
[302:26.48]What's going on here?
[302:32.64]People sure have all kinds of challenges to face.
[302:34.86]At least those guys are diligent.
[302:36.24]They should survive the rough road of the entertainment world.
[302:39.12]Somehow.
[302:42.02]Don't give up, guys.
[302:45.57]Yeah, you should.
[302:51.39]Got something you doing?
[302:54.05]Keep trying.
[302:54.41]Make sure you're having fun doing it.
[303:11.14]Is it save point?
[303:12.14]Alright, now I'm gonna go bowling.
[303:16.71]The book is going to make the combat unplayably hard.
[303:30.99]What the?
[303:34.71]Who is this guy?
[303:38.69]I'll go back to Brawler.
[303:39.41]Back to Brawler.
[303:55.04]Stop hurting these guys.
[303:56.64]They attacked me.
[303:57.16]Alright, let's go bowling.
[304:02.91]I'm into bowling.
[304:10.13]Use the book.
[304:11.01]Use the book.
[304:16.00]Okay.
[304:16.90]Hello, how can I help you?
[304:18.96]I'd like to challenge the staff.
[304:24.72]500 yen.
[304:25.10]How many would you like to play?
[304:33.37]I'm free.
[304:41.29]You challenge the staff to get a chicken.
[304:44.39]Well, let me just.
[304:45.97]Figure out how to do it first.
[304:49.32]OK, pull up the position and select ball.
[304:53.58]And then you can adjust the spin.
[304:56.14]And then just set power.
[304:57.56]Okay.
[305:02.70]Alright, 12 pounds.
[305:03.60]Okay.
[305:11.78]Adjust the power.
[305:14.50]Press left, right, before releasing the ball to adjust the spin.
[305:24.32]But that was the computer doing that.
[305:25.58]It wasn't me doing that.
[305:29.81]Let's go.
[305:37.61]Alright, let's go.
[305:38.27]I want the 12 pound ball.
[305:39.75]No, I want the 16 pound heavy tank.
[305:42.65]I'm going to do the thing that I used to do when I went bowling.
[305:45.09]And that's you get the huge, wicked, fucking heavy ball.
[305:48.94]And you just roll it really slowly, diaper style, down the middle of the lane.
[305:54.06]Well, I didn't get a chance to do that, did I?
[305:56.94]This is going to be great.
[306:12.39]Diaper style is one.
[306:15.91]Diaper style is you go between your legs, back, and then forward.
[306:30.21]Too much spin.
[306:30.82]Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much, too much.
[306:32.48]See, this is why I need to do it first before I challenge any staff member.
[306:43.01]You mean granny style?
[306:44.09]It's diaper style.
[306:46.63]And you can do weirdo style, which is you go here.
[306:52.06]Or you go here, you throw it diagonal, and you try to get it to spin across the entire lane.
[306:55.84]Or you can do it here.
[307:04.51]Huh.
[307:06.13]Fuck.
[307:11.10]That's the best strategy I know.
[307:12.65]Would I call it weirdo style?
[307:22.39]It was a slight curve.
[307:23.98]Just a little, not very much.
[307:25.48]Alright, I get the hang of it.
[307:28.24]Let's do eight pound.
[307:43.05]That's really slow.
[307:43.91]We need a very small spin here.
[307:45.63]It's going to be very, very slow.
[307:50.79]Almost.
[307:53.62]Hit a striker, I'm going to leave.
[307:54.70]Okay.
[307:55.96]Well, how long are you going to stay here for?
[307:58.44]Oh shit.
[308:06.16]Okay, hold on.
[308:06.70]This is going to take some spin.
[308:14.04]Way too much.
[308:14.58]Way too much.
[308:15.12]Way, way, way too much.
[308:21.16]Bowl until you get a perfect game.
[308:22.46]Alright, now let's challenge a staff member.
[308:25.80]I get it.
[308:30.44]Your bowling form is exquisite.
[308:33.10]You think so?
[308:33.72]It really is.
[308:34.28]The angle of your bottom when you release the ball is optimal.
[308:36.99]Where'd you learn how to do that?
[308:40.09]No way.
[308:40.97]That's amazing.
[308:43.01]You know how to position your body to the best effect, your form.
[308:45.99]It's really delightful.
[308:46.79]Oh, I'm sorry.
[308:50.13]It's just that I kind of have a balling form fetish.
[308:52.89]Alright.
[308:58.36]It just went up.
[308:59.38]The game went up like two full letter grades.
[309:03.14]When I see someone with good form, I sort of forget myself.
[309:06.76]I see.
[309:07.04]I guess this job's perfect for you then.
[309:10.95]Yes, I think so too.
[309:13.19]My name's Emiri.
[309:15.16]What?
[309:16.14]Hope to see you here more often.
[309:17.12]You have become a regular, okay?
[309:21.04]Yeah, maybe I will.
[309:21.94]It was nice to meet you.
[309:24.56]This could be the beginning of a friendship with Emiri.
[309:27.54]Interacting with her will gradually fill the friendship gauge.
[309:30.69]You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu.
[309:33.97]Build your friendship with Emiri and see what happens.
[309:36.45]Yup.
[309:39.54]Me and Amiri, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna go after, me and Amiri, I'm gonna be like, hey, you wanna go out for, hey, you wanna go bowling?
[309:45.52]Amiri, um, this is crazy, but, uh, you ever wanna go bowling sometime?
[310:01.66]Would you like to play bowling?
[310:03.45]Yes, with pleasure.
[310:04.39]That'll be $500.
[310:05.53]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[310:10.52]I was going to say, that's not what I was looking for.
[310:12.44]Okay.
[310:14.51]Let's play.
[310:25.55]Here we go.
[310:27.94]Okay, what if I destroy her?
[310:32.63]Where's my, you know, where's my, where's my 10 pound?
[310:34.79]There we go.
[310:35.33]Here's my eight pound.
[310:36.03]It's going to be good.
[310:38.71]That's going to be good.
[310:40.57]It's going to be a strike.
[310:42.23]If it's not a strike, add a million dollars to the debt.
[310:46.33]Oh my God.
[310:47.07]I get something for that.
[310:47.81]I have to.
[310:55.53]Oh shit.
[310:55.93]Tomato.
[310:56.31]What's up?
[310:57.19]Tomato raid.
[310:59.65]What the hell is this strategy?
[311:01.97]What?
[311:08.22]Not a bad strategy.
[311:11.43]Thanks, Tomato.
[311:11.83]Hope you had a good stream.
[311:13.25]Welcome, everybody.
[311:15.15]We're playing... Why am I sitting... Why am I watching her from that far away?
[311:20.73]Aren't we together?
[311:24.89]Why am I across the entire world?
[311:29.76]You're not going to pick it up.
[311:31.00]Oh, my God.
[311:31.90]You left one pin.
[311:35.92]She sucks.
[311:36.72]How does it?
[311:37.22]No, she doesn't.
[311:37.70]She got a nine.
[311:38.48]Is she wearing heels?
[311:42.14]Oh, fuck.
[311:45.21]Okay, this is important.
[311:52.51]No!
[311:52.93]God damn it.
[312:00.79]That wasn't funny.
[312:06.02]This is going to be good right here.
[312:07.00]This is going to be strike again.
[312:12.05]There it is.
[312:13.05]Oh yeah.
[312:13.81]He picked it up.
[312:14.65]He's alright.
[312:15.31]He picked it up.
[312:16.75]He picked it up.
[312:26.58]I feel like the computer just guessed three or four times in a row.
[312:41.94]Alright, so now I'm going to do the comedy thing that happens in every movie.
[312:48.75]By the way, bowling has not appeared in a movie in like 15 years.
[312:52.81]But every time it used to... Oh, shit.
[312:54.95]I'm sorry.
[312:55.69]I mean, nice.
[312:56.19]Almost.
[312:56.49]Good.
[312:56.67]Nice try.
[313:03.34]um every like 90s movie that was a comedy they'd be a bowling segment with like the person that was bowling would something would happen with their hand in the bowling ball and they would get stuck in there and then they would like fly down the entire bowling uh lane and hit the pins with their body and shit how come they haven't made that joke in like 20 years
[313:29.30]Did that happen in too many movies and they were like, no, no, no, no, no more fly down the lane bowling joke.
[313:39.04]This is perfect.
[313:46.36]There it is.
[313:47.46]More, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[313:53.94]When was the last?
[313:54.58]Okay.
[313:55.26]I have homework for you guys.
[313:58.08]You're laughing at me doing that, but you just got a gutter ball.
[314:00.64]Come on.
[314:02.66]What was the last movie that had person flies down the lane holding the ball in their hand?
[314:16.29]It happens in the Avengers?
[314:17.97]No, it doesn't.
[314:23.73]It does not happen in the Avengers.
[314:26.95]No, it does not.
[314:27.73]It does not happen in the Avengers.
[314:30.09]No, it doesn't.
[314:32.33]I refuse to believe that.
[314:34.03]Okay.
[314:47.62]Avengers bowling scene.
[314:52.80]No, there is no bowling scene in the Avengers.
[314:55.30]What are you talking about?
[314:59.09]Wait a minute.
[315:01.31]Is a bowling scene in... No.
[315:03.00]Nope.
[315:04.78]I don't have it right.
[315:12.96]I'm gonna do two... Yeah, here we go.
[315:14.26]That's a bit... Perfect.
[315:17.58]Strike.
[315:24.19]It happens to Thanos?
[315:29.19]Yeah, the infinity gauntlet gets stuck in the bowling ball.
[315:32.01]I don't want to take it off though.
[315:33.80]I need to keep it on.
[315:46.79]Oh, hilarious.
[315:51.71]Pretending?
[315:52.15]What?
[315:52.35]This is not me playing.
[316:02.56]Look at that spin.
[316:03.34]No, no spin at all.
