[16:29.68]It's not gonna happen.
[16:30.30]This is not a scary game.
[16:32.42]I'm not gonna get scared by this game.
[16:34.63]Because this game came out back when Little Girl is Scary was huge.
[16:39.79]And holy shit.
[16:42.22]If a little girl is like on camera and she's standing at the end of a hallway, she's fucking terrifying.
[16:48.43]That doesn't scare me anymore.
[16:49.31]I've seen it a hundred times.
[16:51.39]Back in like 2008, 2007, whatever it was.
[16:59.22]Why are you naked?

[17:05.89]And you can not have clothes on and not be naked.

[17:12.15]Alright, let's go.

[18:27.68]I'm still cool.
[18:29.65]And I know that anytime you have to say that you're still cool, it means you're not cool anymore, but I know I still am.
[18:36.51]Alright, uh, Spod, Spod D Mission in the Auburn Industrial District.
[18:42.70]Your new orders are to proceed to the private residence of Genevieve Aristide of Aracham Technology Corporation and take her into protective custody.
[18:54.73]She will instruct you where to escort her.
[18:56.67]Is this a 90 FOV?
[18:59.31]I hope so.
[19:01.47]I didn't download any community mod patches or anything.
[19:03.47]Is this a 90 FOV?
[19:08.68]Why is it so low?
[19:10.26]Volume.
[19:18.50]It's 65.
[19:19.40]No, it's not.
[19:28.43]I remember optimizing my Fear 2 experience.
[19:31.03]Uh-oh.
[19:40.02]You need to optimize it.
[19:41.12]Alright, fear two.
[19:44.26]What?
[19:44.62]What the heck, man?
[19:45.88]Scared.
[19:50.34]Oh, my God.
[19:50.84]Little girl with a teddy bear.
[19:52.27]She must be scary.
[19:55.23]Little girl with a teddy bear.
[19:56.63]There may have been some blood on the teddy bear.
[19:58.01]That must be scary to me.
[20:00.41]This is dark.
[20:04.01]Hold on.
[20:05.05]Right off the bat, I already see a problem.
[20:06.62]Just give me a second.
[20:08.92]Yeah, that's got to go down.
[20:10.46]Alright, how about FOV?
[20:13.32]Video settings.
[20:16.18]You know you're in trouble when the only video settings in-game are a brightness and a resolution.
[20:20.39]Okay, what about... Whatever.
[20:22.49]You should invert the aim.
[20:26.91]That wasn't even scary.
[20:32.83]Back in 2012, that was terrifying.
[20:34.81]That's still too high, though.
[20:35.72]Hold on.
[20:39.29]Okay, that scared me.
[20:45.74]Where did I go?
[20:46.32]Alright, let's go.
[20:56.91]How does this still feel like too high of a mouse sensitivity?
[21:01.45]Go in?
[21:12.83]And not only that, but there's like scary music box music.
[21:18.20]It got me.
[21:18.68]It got me.
[21:18.96]I got to turn the camera on.
[21:21.56]Shit.
[21:24.02]No.
[21:25.42]I didn't mean.
[21:26.54]No, that didn't even get me.
[21:28.33]That didn't get me.
[21:29.15]It wasn't even that that got me.
[21:30.45]It was the fact that I was looking at the music box and I sat down right on my chair.
[21:34.83]There was a glass on it and it hurt my bum.
[21:37.95]I don't have clothes on.
[21:38.77]Hold on.
[21:39.15]I can't.
[21:39.87]Hold on.
[21:40.21]It's going to have to be in a minute.
[21:41.84]Where are we driving?
[21:42.86]Are we driving off-road?
[21:53.52]I don't want any breakage, even if she resists.
[21:56.56]We're bumping around like we're at the Tower of Terror.
[22:00.16]It's like a Universal Studios ride.
[22:03.36]It's like the Back to the Future ride.
[22:05.06]She's a high value target and we've been tasked to bring her in, so that's what we're going to do.
[22:09.83]Put on a seatbelt.
[22:11.31]Lighten up, Tom.
[22:12.37]She's a suit.
[22:13.29]What's she going to do?
[22:14.05]Send a nasty text message?
[22:15.75]She's not the problem.
[22:17.23]Okay, for a second I thought that was my finger over there pointing at them like, yes, Joe, you talk.
[22:21.25]Now what do you have to say?
[22:22.23]Fox, you're with Stokes.
[22:27.75]Keegan, you're with me.
[22:29.03]Beckett, Red, Manny will drop you off in front of the building.
[22:31.19]There's a lot of people.
[22:31.97]That's us.
[22:33.27]Shit.
[22:34.45]No shit.
[22:35.23]Because I don't like crybabies.
[22:38.75]Now, let's move.
[22:39.81]These guns.
[22:40.45]Okay, the guns.
[22:41.15]They're kind of pointing them.
[22:42.57]I don't like how they're pointing the guns at each other.
[22:44.08]Remember, people.
[22:44.82]Trigger discipline.
[22:46.18]Our mission is to find Aristide, not cap her ass.
[22:49.42]This op is bullshit, man.
[22:51.18]What's so important about this chick that the cops can't pick her up?
[22:54.44]Yeah, I know.
[22:55.44]Dude.
[22:55.86]Do you want to start taking hits with that fire extinguisher?
[22:59.57]Like, fuck it.
[23:00.11]It's just us here.
[23:00.83]That situation is getting out of control.
[23:02.63]Nah, dude.
[23:03.07]Not at all.
[23:03.89]Alright.
[23:04.19]I'm just kidding.
[23:04.89]Alright, here we go.
[23:09.68]PDA.
[23:10.28]Submachine gun.
[23:16.15]Okay, I can't even shoot at him.
[23:20.39]Really?
[23:20.75]Okay.
[23:22.25]Access PDA.
[23:24.03]Place Genevieve Aristide in protective custody.
[23:26.73]Rendezvous with your team in the building lobby.
[23:29.58]Base camp.
[23:30.82]Why a shift aimed down sights?
[23:32.64]That's not going to happen.
[23:33.56]Let's go back here for a sec.
[23:35.49]Wait a minute.
[23:36.78]I gotta brush my teeth.
[23:38.36]I gotta brush my teeth.
[23:39.00]Alright, I'll put a face cam on, but I gotta brush my teeth first, and I gotta put clothes on.
[23:42.18]God fucking dammit.
[23:43.74]I didn't want to put a face cam on today.
[23:45.14]Alright, I'm gonna brush my teeth, and I'm gonna put clothes on.

[28:17.88]Of course you are.
[28:18.34]Alright, what do we look like?
[28:20.90]Let's see.
[28:21.20]How are we doing today?
[28:32.39]I told you I had to put clothes on.
[28:33.69]I had to get like a shirt.
[28:35.33]I had to get like, I had to brush my fucking teeth.
[28:42.47]I had to go like this with my hair.
[28:44.57]I had to go like... How many boogers on my hands?
[28:48.47]No, we're good.
[28:50.31]Nice V-neck.
[28:51.11]I own a lot of V-necks, actually.
[28:52.76]Okay, wait a second.
[29:04.16]Wait a second.
[29:09.04]Nice villain hair today.
[29:11.70]The thing is, I... I think every day is villain here.
[29:16.74]If I'm honest.
[29:18.60]At this point.
[29:21.98]Okay, so this is where I'm going to be sitting.
[29:23.41]Like this.
[29:25.73]Am I in frame?
[29:32.59]How's that look?
[29:33.97]Look evil?
[29:36.99]How's it look with the game up?
[29:38.85]Am I blocking like ammo and shit?
[29:40.71]I probably am.
[29:48.70]You want to get a real close look?
[29:51.38]I didn't trim my nose hairs yet.
[29:52.30]Never mind.
[30:00.90]Ain't getting a close look today.
[30:04.22]Okay.
[30:04.42]I think we're good.
[30:10.84]Face came to the wrong spot.
[30:23.12]Alright, now we're good.
[30:23.86]Okay, I'm ready.
[30:26.79]Do it blue again.
[30:27.49]I can't just turn it... Okay, let's go.
[30:31.73]What would I have to do?
[30:33.01]Can't shoot him.
[30:39.07]Alright, right, right, right, right.
[30:40.07]I told you this was going to be a long one.
[30:42.52]Key bindings.
[30:43.72]Where's my chapstick?
[30:46.02]Where's my chapstick?
[30:46.82]I cannot stream without my chapstick.
[30:53.63]I gotta have my chapstick.
[30:56.39]I don't have my chapstick.
[31:02.06]I'm actually furious about that.
[31:05.78]Okay, movement.
[31:06.54]It's interaction.
[31:10.12]Shift.
[31:11.98]Mouse button 2 is already assigned to melee.
[31:15.54]What kind of drugs?
[31:18.46]Make it... No.
[31:19.50]What?
[31:19.70]This needs to be sprint.
[31:21.97]Sprint.
[31:23.88]Forward sprint is alt.
[31:26.46]Excuse me, it's not.
[31:29.73]Sprint shift.
[31:32.09]Shift is already assigned to zoom.
[31:34.27]Yes, that's... No, what are you doing?
[31:36.49]I don't want it to be alt.
[31:37.85]What are you doing?
[31:42.41]Alright, zoom is mouse 2.
[31:43.35]Okay, let's go.
[31:47.08]Much better.
[31:49.12]Much better.
[31:51.20]Okay.
[31:52.70]I'm ready to play the game.
[31:58.44]No melee?
[31:59.14]Don't get too close.
[32:06.70]They'll see your nose hairs.
[32:08.92]Hey, and by the way, I just shaved too.
[32:11.14]What do you guys think of that?
[32:13.65]This is like, I just literally shaved.
[32:15.81]Shaved my face.
[32:16.73]Clean shaven.
[32:18.25]What do you think?
[32:20.23]I'm supposed to be playing a game.
[32:21.35]Like, who cares?
[32:22.19]Who cares if I just shaved?
[32:30.18]What am I looking for?
[32:30.68]I've reloaded?
[32:37.66]What did I do?
[32:38.11]I already forget it.
[32:42.67]What we were just doing.
[32:44.63]Melee.
[32:45.01]Okay.
[32:47.85]Interaction.
[32:48.55]Melee is this button.
[32:53.21]What should I do?
[32:53.95]V?
[32:55.27]Mouse button?
[32:55.63]No, no, no.
[32:55.95]I want mouse button 4.
[32:56.63]Alright, the game doesn't even know you have mouse buttons.
[32:59.73]Middle mouse?
[33:01.13]V. V is assigned to thermal vision.
[33:04.53]Oh my fucking god.
[33:10.67]I don't know.
[33:11.53]What the fuck do you put?
[33:12.55]Alt?
[33:14.32]Alt is already assigned to sprint.
[33:15.56]No, it's not.
[33:17.26]Who has alt for melee?
[33:18.60]Okay.
[33:21.33]Wait, what did I just do that for?
[33:23.71]Why am I, why am I sliding?
[33:27.91]Is that a slide tackle?
[33:33.12]Whatever, let's go.
[33:33.70]Okay, so we gotta go, where are we gonna go?
[33:45.93]Place.
[33:46.65]Yeah, yeah.
[33:47.11]Rendezvous.
[33:47.63]Alright, so we can't go in the front door.
[33:50.31]The sensitivity is still too high.
[33:53.38]I don't even know how that's possible.
[33:55.36]It's at fucking zero.
[33:59.42]This is zero sensitivity, by the way.
[34:02.30]It's zero.
[34:05.54]Go through the coffee shop?
[34:16.12]Alright, well, I'm trying to figure out how to get to the coffee shop, dude.
[34:18.47]Turn it up all the way.
[34:21.43]It's not going to even do anything.
[34:22.33]Alright, we're going that way.
[34:26.67]Eat the chapstick.
[34:27.75]Hold on.
[34:28.11]I'm too busy trying to not have my brain explode out of the front of my eyes because I can't turn the sensitivity down.
[34:40.84]DPI is up.
[34:41.74]Yeah, I can't even change it.
[34:49.65]Cool.
[34:52.46]No DPI button.
[34:53.40]Yeah, the thing that I complained about so much.
[35:00.02]You guys remember when I used to sit here and talk a ton of shit about the DPI button.
[35:05.10]I was like, Razer, holy shit, remove this.
[35:07.80]This button sucks.
[35:09.41]Fuck this button and fuck you, right?
[35:11.55]I've done it probably a thousand times.
[35:15.63]Not there anymore.
[35:18.07]And I need it.
[35:19.53]Right now.
[35:19.83]I thought he just screamed at me.
[35:30.16]No, I don't.
[35:30.72]You're right.
[35:32.38]The gate's locked.
[35:32.86]Alright, let's go this way.
[35:34.00]Move.
[35:34.16]Wait a minute.
[35:48.53]What door?
[35:52.65]Oh, this door.
[35:53.67]Okay, I got a flashlight.
[35:58.46]F. Okay.
[36:04.04]Okay, there's Vindex.
[36:07.30]I'm going to have to turn the DPI down.
[36:09.12]This dude's pretty strong.
[36:10.84]Holy shit.
[36:21.18]Look out.
[36:21.58]Look out.
[36:25.42]The final offer is circulating.
[36:26.64]Okay.
[36:28.10]What happened here?
[36:28.74]How many people are on this team?
[36:32.78]Hold on.
[36:33.00]Let me get a look.
[36:33.76]Let me look at that PC.
[36:34.38]Okay.
[36:50.16]Okay doctor.
[36:50.84]This is a thousand fucking stories.
[36:53.76]Just making sure he was dead.
[37:25.72]I'm not doing my hair.
[37:30.30]I'm sorry.
[37:31.34]That was my fault.
[37:32.98]That was all my fault.
[37:36.36]I'm sitting here going like, oh, man.
[37:38.00]How do I look?
[37:39.33]Hey, Sergeant, what do you think?
[37:40.97]That's just for a hairstyle.
[37:42.57]It's like sniped.
[37:45.17]Oh, man.
[37:54.46]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[37:59.25]Vanity got that guy killed.
[38:09.20]Oh, Arsenal select.
[38:10.12]Whoa, how far are we going?
[38:20.69]Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[38:21.95]It looks pretty good.
[38:25.21]Oh man, yeah, this guy must have been shot in the aorta.
[38:41.64]I was ready for that one.
[38:46.62]Got that one down.
[38:49.28]One more over here.
[38:52.13]Got him.
[38:54.65]Moving up.
[38:57.63]Ow, what?
[38:58.73]Hey!
[38:59.01]Why'd that guy explode?
[39:00.21]That guy just blew up.
[39:28.55]Nice.
[39:28.85]Let me do that too.
[39:36.31]Ooh, is this health?
[39:37.93]Pick up intel.
[39:41.39]Oh.
[39:43.70]Alright.
[39:46.12]Okay.
[39:46.70]I'm at the vault now.
[39:51.36]And plan B is going well.
[39:54.10]I don't read anything in games.
[39:55.12]Alright, I thought that was a pick.
[40:02.89]I could pick that up.
[40:06.37]This guy was using Windex as a weapon.
[40:11.22]This ain't Dead Rising, man.
[40:12.76]That's not going to help you.
[40:18.04]Blue Gatorade.
[40:19.64]It's Blue Gatorade.
[40:22.38]Sprint.
[40:28.72]Is this sprint or is this like lich hover?
[40:35.63]Oh, she's in here.
[40:38.45]Armor vest.
[40:39.01]Nice.
[40:39.31]Okay.
[40:40.85]Bad news.
[40:41.49]You got armor.
[40:43.10]Whatever.
[40:45.96]You missed the...
[40:48.77]Don't tell me I'm going to miss an extinguisher.
[40:50.57]Are you fucking out of your mind?
[40:52.37]Yeah, there goes fucking $40 million worth of stuff.
[41:01.85]Sorry, what's that?
[41:02.73]$50 million.
[41:04.93]Hold on.
[41:08.73]I got to... Slow down.
[41:13.37]I know you think it's funny, Jeremy, but slow down.
[41:16.19]Slow down.
[41:18.62]Hold on.
[41:19.28]It looks like I gotta use my 2 to travel to get extra speed.
[41:22.41]I'm in.
[41:26.67]It's alright.
[41:38.31]I'll take a 50-50.
[41:38.95]I'll take a 50-50 on that one.
[41:43.36]Health pack.
[41:45.18]Z is med kit.
[41:46.04]Okay.
[41:50.79]Haha, that is so funny, Jeremy.
[41:52.19]Don't make me fuckin' ban ya.
[42:01.47]Grenades.
[42:02.37]G is grenade.
[42:03.23]Okay.
[42:09.13]What?
[42:15.43]I feel like the game's in x2 speed.
[42:17.21]Anybody else feel like that?
[42:22.77]Why does it feel like it's in fast motion?
[42:27.18]It's because it's old?
[42:28.96]I'm a boomer.
[42:29.80]Are you sure?
[42:30.24]I feel like I'm... Am I seeing the world in slow motion?
[42:39.40]Probably because of your DPI.
[42:40.78]I don't know.
[42:42.96]The game's going too fast.
[42:48.88]It's because you're stoned.
[42:50.94]No, that's not it.
[42:56.37]Can I kill the helicopter?
[42:58.54]Wait, there might be a secret out here.
[43:11.04]What was that for?
[43:11.60]I just ruined a plant.
[43:18.15]That wasn't even funny.
[43:21.93]Don't deny being stoned.
[43:23.45]I'm not stoned.
[43:25.17]I'm drinking a coffee.
[43:27.49]And... Alright.
[43:32.31]Time to come clean.
[43:34.78]Time to come clean.
[43:37.84]Alright.
[43:38.86]Okay.
[43:40.70]I'm gonna be drinking out of it, so... I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[43:45.86]I've got a product here.
[43:47.81]This is not an endorsement.
[43:50.61]I mean, it kind of is.
[43:51.93]It's not a truly.
[43:53.77]I'm not drinking coffee and fucking truly...
[43:58.00]This is a streamer endorsement.
[43:59.62]I was not paid for this.
[44:00.98]I just thought it was an interesting idea and I did it.
[44:05.94]By the way, I want to make sure I can tell you very... I know, listen.
[44:09.05]There's no soy in this.
[44:10.37]There ain't no fucking soy in here.
[44:11.73]So how dare you say what I think you're going to say.
[44:14.07]It's a heel.
[44:15.89]Don't fucking say it!
[44:25.02]There ain't no soy in this.
[44:27.20]Don't say it.
[44:27.68]There's no soy product.
[44:28.60]It's not a soy product.
[44:31.36]It's not a soy product.
[44:32.92]I'm just trying it.
[44:33.62]I'm just trying it to see if I like it.
[44:37.34]It's a... I can't do this without it sounding like I'm fucking... Alright, listen.
[44:42.56]Sometimes, like, you know, streamer snacks.
[44:44.04]We talked about them.
[44:45.42]And I was like, alright.
[44:46.20]So, like, you get baby food.
[44:47.52]That works.
[44:48.06]That gives you some fruits and vegetables and shit.
[44:51.49]I do that.
[44:52.23]I still do.
[44:53.73]Beef jerky.
[44:54.31]That's a good one.
[44:56.01]This is good, too, for me.
[44:57.75]It's just, like, a bunch of calories.
[44:58.73]It's, like, protein and vitamins and shit.
[45:00.61]And I like it.
[45:04.74]And nobody paid me to say that.
[45:05.76]I did.
[45:07.00]I paid myself.
[45:08.98]I transferred $600 into my account today.
[45:15.15]Paid myself for this one.
[45:21.05]No, all jokes aside, it really is helpful.
[45:22.69]Remember I told you I was trying to put on weight?
[45:25.88]That helped.
[45:28.28]All honesty aside, that's why I started doing it.
[45:30.70]And I put on a bunch of weight.
[45:36.29]Alright, let's go.
[45:37.46]You're gonna see it.
[45:38.08]I know people are gonna see it if I took sips out of it.
[45:40.96]It's not Gruul.
[45:45.38]It all went to your ass.
[45:47.22]It was already like that, even when I was losing a little bit of weight.
[45:53.08]Gamer Gruul.
[45:58.03]All honesty aside.
[45:58.93]Alright, I gotta play the game.
[46:03.45]Where was I going?
[46:07.90]And there's no soy.
[46:08.66]There's no soy in Huel.
[46:11.46]None.
[46:13.38]So all of you that want to call me that word, sorry, you can't do it.
[46:25.46]Okay, fire mode.
[46:26.36]B is burst fire.
[46:28.26]Oh, that's single shot, actually.
[46:30.42]Play the game, you clown.
[46:32.76]I am.
[46:33.24]Just hold on.
[46:33.95]I had to do my fucking Huel endorsement.
[46:37.80]I really was not paid to do that.
[46:39.23]I just like it.
[46:40.45]So, give it a rest.
[46:42.05]Alright.
[46:51.84]Forget about... New fire mode.
[46:55.76]I have to turn the D... When I... Okay.
[46:57.14]Next... When I go on break, the DPI is going to like 2.
[46:58.90]This guy is unstoppable.
[47:02.93]Are they talking about me?
[47:08.02]Alright, headshots only.
[47:10.00]Think I can do it?
[47:10.54]Single shots.
[47:11.04]Okay, headshots only if I don't get... Never mind.
[47:13.96]Just play.
[47:18.02]Uh, don't I have a health kit?
[47:18.96]Isn't it Z?
[47:27.39]Oh, I guess I can... Can I just walk in this?
[47:34.33]It's gonna be something with the dead.
[47:35.53]No, it's not.
[47:41.81]Shotgun?
[47:42.77]Sick.
[47:44.09]Grenades?
[47:44.67]Sick.
[47:45.67]Fuck it.
[47:45.97]It's all.
[48:01.18]Pick up what?
[48:02.62]Forks?
[48:03.28]Oh, you can't like throw spoons at people?
[48:05.36]Shit.
[48:14.97]Well.
[48:17.07]Um.
[48:18.33]Turn the fucking DPI down.
[48:22.53]How do I do that?
[48:23.91]Somebody help me.
[48:25.86]How do I turn the DPI down on my mouse?
[48:29.36]Like mouse settings, right?
[48:36.59]Stoned off.
[48:37.57]DPI plus 4.
[48:39.07]F4.
[48:40.35]Razer Synapse.
[48:41.01]I'm not downloading that fucking pro- I will not download that program.
[48:43.79]I would rather play like this than download that.
[48:47.37]Um, how do I do it?
[48:48.63]Do I actually have to download that?
[48:52.69]No, I don't want it.
[48:55.21]Term of blue, what?
[48:56.79]You need to download and fix your game.
[48:59.17]I need to download a fix for the game.
[49:00.51]Are you serious?
[49:05.40]Don't tell me that.
[49:07.45]Because that's a lie, right?
[49:10.95]PC Gaming Wiki.
[49:12.03]Fear 2 Mouse Fix.
[49:18.22]What is this?
[49:18.70]This makes Fear 2 use raw mouse input and removes the game's dead zone and sensitivity problems.
[49:26.12]Right.
[49:28.23]Okay.
[49:30.01]Extract this...
[49:36.86]I gotta close the game.
[49:37.66]I need to... Where's the save point here?
[49:41.67]Okay.
[49:42.85]Exit 21.
[49:43.37]Just watch some artwork.
[49:44.52]I'll be right back.
[49:45.50]We're gonna go long today.
[49:46.60]I promise.
[52:25.27]Alright, let's see if it worked.
[52:27.29]That image.
[52:28.85]That image.
[52:31.20]The image of me existed on the internet.
[52:34.46]That I hated.
[52:35.18]It was the worst photo ever.
[52:37.82]I was like, I fucking hate that photo.
[52:39.68]I wish something would take it over.
[52:41.06]Something would be more popular than that image of my face that I don't like.
[52:46.21]And then the monkey paw curled.
[52:49.35]And that image has just gone crazy.
[52:54.17]And it's just, you be careful what you wish for, as they say.
[53:05.11]So, you know, the monkey paw, yeah.
[53:12.80]Just be careful what you wish for.
[53:14.50]It just might come true.
[53:17.59]Indebted.
[53:18.09]Hey, Banana Bros!
[53:23.97]Alright, let's see if this worked.
[53:25.25]Hopefully this works.
[53:25.87]I did all the instructions.
[53:26.87]Hopefully it worked.
[53:29.90]Fix your damn game.
[53:31.82]We're going long today.
[53:32.82]Don't worry.
[53:34.48]I'm here for a while.
[53:36.16]It's going to be more than a four hour stream.
[53:37.96]Don't you guys understand?
[53:38.48]It must just be like a virus or something that I just downloaded and I'm an idiot.
[53:44.24]I've done the first link in chat and all of a sudden my computer gets compromised.
[53:57.92]Guys, I'm in his computer.
[53:58.82]There's a ton of porn.
[54:05.16]Okay.
[54:06.10]Come on.
[54:06.60]Please work.
[54:09.38]Oh, look at that.
[54:10.06]Did it work?
[54:16.16]Guys, it worked.
[54:17.86]Everything is perfect.
[54:18.90]We're ready to go.
[54:19.60]I'm ready to play Fear 2.
[54:23.22]Are you ready to enjoy this journey with me?
[54:26.28]I hope you are.
[54:28.05]Let's come on back now.
[54:31.99]Oh, shit.
[54:32.79]That's fucking incredible.
[54:37.64]Look at how good I looked.
[54:45.52]Oh, Genos and Smash.
[54:46.72]I already read it.
[54:47.54]You can't make me sad anymore.
[54:49.46]I already read it.
[54:57.12]It's never going to happen.
[54:57.96]He's always going to be like a fucking sticker for the rest of his life.
[55:01.96]Whatever.
[55:02.28]Who cares?
[55:02.68]Let's go.
[55:07.01]Getting some Count Olaf here today.
[55:08.87]I kind of like it.
[55:18.44]There we go.
[55:19.16]Look at that.
[55:19.88]It's a video game now.
[55:30.15]There we go.
[55:30.71]It's a video game now.
[55:31.85]It's a video game.
[55:32.71]I can play the video game.
[55:43.24]God damn it.
[55:43.86]Whatever.
[55:44.12]I was trying to do something cool, but it failed.
[55:47.84]How do I crouch?
[55:50.44]Am I dead?
[56:01.92]Whoa, what?
[56:04.64]No deal.
[56:05.28]No deal.
[56:07.28]Deanna's forced to sing the Drummer raid song.
[56:12.95]What are you guys doing to her?
[56:21.79]Okay, I'm good.
[56:24.91]You forced her to sing the raid song.
[56:27.75]What is... Why are you guys doing this?
[56:30.80]Hold on.
[56:31.12]Eat...
[56:32.35]Okay.
[56:34.37]I have to watch it.
[56:35.17]I'm playing a video game.
[56:36.47]I'll watch it in a minute.
[56:38.37]That sounded like a character.
[56:39.19]I don't know what one.
[56:49.40]That wasn't Adam Sandler.
[56:50.26]No.
[56:51.62]That guy was waiting for me.
[56:52.32]Do you have any grenades?
[57:02.20]No, I don't want burst fire, dude.
[57:03.88]Give me like the... Okay, there it is.
[57:07.62]You always sound like Adam Sandler.
[57:08.87]I don't think always.
[57:10.69]Maybe sometimes.
[57:11.67]Alright, let's go.
[57:16.39]I need a health pack.
[57:20.11]I don't always sound like Adam Sandler.
[57:25.72]By the way, I'm having some trouble with this game.
[57:29.22]What does that bar mean?
[57:33.19]Better.
[57:34.69]Is that health or is red?
[57:36.47]I don't understand what it means.
[57:37.47]I don't get it.
[57:41.13]It looks red.
[57:46.13]But there's no, it's not decreasing.
[57:59.42]Dude, please quit touching your hair.
[58:00.84]You're making it worse.
[58:04.33]Don't you make fun of my hair.
[58:05.73]Okay, here we go.
[58:20.56]That was an actor.
[58:22.25]That was a stuntman.
[58:28.43]He even went...
[58:32.91]Alright, watch it.
[58:33.83]Watch it.
[58:34.23]Hold on.
[58:34.59]Let's see.
[58:38.88]Guinness is forced to sing the raid song.
[58:46.74]That's not her.
[58:54.49]Let's see.
[59:05.51]Literally, you're a handsome Jack.
[59:07.25]But I don't have the things here.
[59:10.73]Why am I blue?
[59:12.48]Because... It's because my screen is blue.
[59:15.36]What do you think I am?
[59:16.74]Blue?
[59:17.04]Alright, here it comes.
[59:29.13]That's pretty good.
[59:32.37]That's way better than what I do!
[59:51.03]Gonna clap my ass real fast and nice.
[59:54.53]Gonna say hello to all these guys.
[59:58.21]Hello.
[59:59.27]Welcome to my stream.
[60:00.92]I'm fucking streaming right now.
[60:03.14]I am playing a game.
[60:08.96]That came out of nowhere.
[60:15.04]Clapping my ass right now.
[60:20.44]Get that off.
[60:22.10]Hey, you get off.
[60:26.26]Don't right now.
[60:27.10]Don't.
[60:28.08]Don't actually.
[60:34.17]I have to hide right now.
[60:35.51]I gotta hide.
[60:36.81]I gotta turn the camera off.
[60:37.87]I gotta hide.
[60:38.19]I'm back.
[60:48.36]Fucking cooler than ever.
[60:52.38]I'm not blue anymore.
[60:53.20]I'm clapping my ass.
[61:01.09]Why is it locked?
[61:13.08]Alright, it's not going to happen to me.
[61:23.28]Alright.
[61:49.36]Does this guy just fall off by himself?
[62:04.99]Come on.
[62:12.10]He does it every time.
[62:12.90]Alright, I want more health.
[62:17.50]Are you okay?
[62:19.17]I want more health.
[62:23.73]I wonder what happens if I go up.
[62:26.21]Hold on, I'm not going to kill him yet.
[62:31.06]All quiet.
[62:33.18]What's your status?
[62:46.00]Why did it not explode?
[62:50.21]Why did it not explode?
[62:51.03]Alright, get me in this.
[63:11.02]I have to go in this- I have to go in there, right?
[63:23.27]Uh oh.
[63:25.81]Do it!
[63:36.77]Okay, whatever.
[63:39.88]Can I swim?
[63:41.34]So what?
[63:58.77]Hidden door.
[63:59.29]Remember, you look handsome.
[64:12.79]How about now?
[64:13.27]I don't need more.
[64:16.81]I'm gonna cam off now.
[64:31.66]OK.
[64:33.15]That's a lot of people.
[64:34.23]Their grenade.
[64:34.75]Still got it.
[65:08.64]I don't care about the lore.
[65:11.17]Little girl scary is the whole game.
[65:12.87]Okay, what do we... That hurt my shoulder.
[65:30.63]Wait, this piano.
[65:31.27]Hold on.
[65:31.43]Piano!
[65:40.04]What?
[65:42.46]Why did it just turn into like a cut oak tree?
[65:54.11]Okay.
[65:55.25]Let's go.
[65:56.54]When do I get the superpowers?
[66:05.56]Do I get- Do you get superpowers in this game?
[66:12.18]When is- Oh, shit.
[66:13.26]I don't- I- That's all I care about.
[66:15.16]No, you don't- You thought you looked cool, but it was kind of cool.
[66:21.76]But you should have just held the trigger down when you heard the footsteps in front of the door.
[66:33.13]Scary girl.
[66:34.39]Where is she?
[66:36.21]Scary girl.
[66:37.03]She's around somewhere.
[66:38.09]Why is my instinct to just shoot her?
[66:43.94]I feel like she's going to turn around and try to kill me.
[66:50.40]You know what I think it is?
[66:51.52]It's me just pre-firing the jump scare.
[66:55.07]Because if she turns around and screams, I'm already, like the gun's already screaming, so I'm already ready.
[67:09.84]Alright.
[67:10.76]Secret.
[67:11.14]Hold on a sec.
[67:12.50]Just.
[67:47.12]It was hair.
[67:48.99]It was hair.
[67:49.75]It was my hair though.
[67:52.05]It was my hair.
[67:54.99]That was my hair.
[67:57.77]That was my hair.
[67:58.81]It definitely fell in.
[68:00.94]It was long and it was like blonde and brown.
[68:03.54]It was this long.
[68:05.90]That was my hair.
[68:06.78]It might have been.
[68:12.20]I don't know.
[68:12.58]I think it was mine.
[68:28.54]I would have shot out into the screen if I didn't- if I wasn't careful.
[68:32.38]I was about to just start cracking up with it in my mouth.
[68:34.18]Don't ever drink when you- don't ever do that.
[68:36.26]That's a thick liquid too.
[68:37.48]Don't laugh while you have a thick liquid.
[68:42.32]I'm like talking and I was like, oh yeah, you man.
[68:44.78]What the- I swear to God that was my hair.
[68:48.25]I know it was.
[68:50.31]Trust me.
[68:50.83]I know what it looks like.
[68:51.79]I know what it looks like.
[68:58.81]I just want you to know the things I like, okay?
[69:01.27]It's a product I like.
[69:02.41]Okay.

[69:33.25]It's protein.

[69:45.46]Okay.
[69:48.04]There's no soy in this.
[69:49.92]Read my fucking bottle.
[69:51.16]My bottle doesn't have that word.

[69:58.21]Can you read it?
[70:00.58]Soy free.
[70:02.92]Absolutely soy free.
[70:11.27]This is probably a different product.

[72:52.07]I feel like that was supposed to be a little bit more blurry.
[73:03.11]Did we just get nuked?
[73:08.04]What?
[73:09.28]Why did we get nuked?
[73:20.67]Oh, I gotta make room for the fuel.

[73:44.06]Like Agent Smith's or something?
[73:45.54]We don't have much time.
[73:56.08]That was the ending to Fear 1, was it?
[73:58.71]I don't remember any of that.
[74:09.93]You guys are spamming me with a video.
[74:14.05]I'm getting spammed.
[74:19.24]You don't pay attention to lore, that's why.
[74:21.20]Guys, I played Fear 1 like three years ago.
[74:29.62]Alright, I'm gonna listen to the video.
[74:31.68]I'll listen to the video.
[74:32.68]What do you guys want me to hear so bad?
[74:36.08]Jerma is so nice.
[74:37.26]I don't deserve this at all.
[74:38.92]Like, I'm just like... I'm a fucking, like, piece of slime that's been scraped off of the bottom of a sewer.
[74:47.20]And Jerma is like...
[74:49.58]A piece of better slime that has been scraped off of the top of the sewer.
[74:55.78]He's the top of the sewer and I'm the bottom.
[74:58.58]Wait, I didn't.
[75:00.91]God damn.
[75:02.99]Okay.
[75:06.13]I think I'm fucking carved out of stone.
[75:08.29]I'm honest with you.
[75:12.45]I think that fucking God threw down lightning down and St.
[75:16.90]Peter fucking carved me out of a goddamn slab of stone.
[75:22.30]Zeus struck the lightning down.
[75:24.80]It turned into me.
[75:30.79]Exactly what somebody that is at the top of this line would say.
[75:33.05]Oh, okay.
[75:37.83]Sure thing, whatever.
[75:41.45]He's stoned.
[75:42.92]Okay, I did not expect that guy to be there.
[75:44.46]Ego maniac.
[75:45.52]Use gun.
[75:46.36]And if that don't work, then use more gun.
[75:50.42]What are they doing to me?
[75:51.24]Holy shit, that's not how you have surgery done.
[76:12.90]What are they fucking doing?
[76:22.06]Oh my god.
[76:23.18]We have just a general appendix surgery.
[76:26.12]Nothing that we have to be afraid of.
[76:27.49]This is just two guys playing Surgeon Simulator on some asshole.
[76:34.11]That was insane.
[76:46.00]This game is fucking crazy.
[76:54.48]I don't have any organs left.
[76:56.27]I have no organs.
[77:01.49]Put your gamer glasses on?
[77:09.53]I don't have any.
[77:12.03]Google Glass.
[77:15.22]Alright Intel who cares?
[77:27.79]Find a weapon.
[77:32.24]I'm gonna OK.
[77:32.90]I've been I've swallowed so much air from laughing at random stuff while trying to drink at the same time so.
[77:39.81]It's going to happen.
[77:41.63]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[77:42.63]This is why I don't put cameras on.
[77:44.81]I fucking hate webcams.
[77:46.53]I don't want a webcam on me.
[77:48.45]I don't.
[77:48.89]Get it off.
[77:50.25]Turn it off right now.
[77:54.71]Is that totally backwards?
[77:56.73]Isn't that supposed to be the other way?
[77:59.57]That looks different to me.
[78:00.97]No, no, right?
[78:01.68]No.
[78:08.19]Isn't that, like, the... The lip is crooked.
[78:10.69]Yeah, I know, but, like, isn't the lip... Is this the spaces there?
[78:13.86]I guess some toilets have the space.
[78:15.12]Alright, I need a weapon.
[78:19.94]It's not a weapon.
[78:31.09]I don't like getting out of this fucking place.
[78:33.93]Oh, a human!
[78:44.87]Terms of service.
[78:45.53]No, I'll be fine.
[78:47.43]I'll be fine.
[78:47.79]Don't worry.
[78:48.57]Are you afraid?
[78:48.91]I mean, I could be a little, a little, a little chilly right now.
[78:55.03]You know, I'm a little cold.
[78:56.09]Uh, I'm not scared.
[78:56.57]At this point, we cannot know the initial injury report or the cause of the explosion.
[78:58.61]We'll let you know as soon as we find out what's happened.
[79:16.61]You should be.
[79:21.94]Well, I'm not.
[79:23.42]Wait.
[79:23.92]Okay, I thought that was a guy leaning back with a gun.
[79:27.46]Like N64 style.
[79:29.72]He looked like Polygon.
[79:30.76]I thought he had a gun back there.
[79:32.20]I was like, what the fuck is this guy with a gun doing back here?
[79:41.98]Save the game?
[79:42.60]I think it's automatically doing it.
[79:52.29]Open.
[79:54.09]Open the door.
[79:58.73]What?
[80:01.08]Why do these don't open?
[80:01.96]Okay.
[80:05.36]Oh, a professional doctor.
[80:09.00]Did that hurt me?
[80:24.51]Oh, it's for cover.
[80:25.47]I get it.
[80:25.81]What?
[80:32.39]Blood.
[80:35.87]Smash or.
[80:36.83]I don't know, whatever.
[80:41.08]Oh, no more blood.
[80:47.92]Blood.
[80:51.52]Blood.
[80:56.51]What a weird substance.
[80:59.89]It's so bizarre that we have, like, human oil that, like, makes us run.
[81:03.57]This is weird.
[81:15.76]Uh, what am I supposed to do?
[81:17.00]Is there another way to go?
[81:28.07]Restricted area.
[81:35.23]Running in circles?
[81:36.01]No, I'm not.
[81:36.68]I'm here.
[81:37.06]Here it is.
[81:38.80]How am I speed bagging this thing?
[81:48.96]Jerma, go read an analog clock.
[81:51.08]Give me one.
[81:52.20]Give me one.
[81:52.50]Give me a time.
[81:53.34]I'll do it right now.
[81:53.90]I'm not high.
[81:54.68]I've not had any CBD, any THC, none today.
[81:57.25]Zero.
[81:58.79]Read any analog clock you want.
[82:06.55]Can I just go in?
[82:10.73]Whoa, it's control.
[82:11.71]Hold on.
[82:17.73]I can't, like, get out of this?
[82:24.70]Come on, what?
[82:30.01]Oh dude, this is really spooky.
[82:33.71]It kind of is.
[82:37.85]Oh.
[82:45.07]What was he holding?
[82:47.19]Is this a bottle of hydrogen peroxide?
[82:56.66]Where did he even come from?
[83:01.27]It's Pepto-Bismol.
[83:09.99]Gun.
[83:10.21]I need a gun, right?
[83:19.68]Hold on.
[83:21.96]I'm getting more.
[83:22.66]There's more spam going on here.
[83:25.15]Alright, after this, no more links.
[83:26.95]I'm done.
[83:27.23]It's really quiet.
[83:35.45]Wait, are we going to do this thing?
[83:36.65]Hold on.
[83:39.25]I need to put on, like, a different shirt and pretend like I'm seeing it's another day.
[83:44.26]Give me once.
[83:44.60]Give me a second.
[83:45.04]Hold on.
[83:46.40]I'm going to put, like, fucking, like, another game in the background, too.
[83:48.94]Hold on.
[83:49.18]Give me once.
[83:49.46]I'll be right back.
[84:13.38]No, this is fine.
[84:14.00]I don't need another... I can just put this around my neck and stuff.
[84:17.56]This works.
[84:17.84]I have to have different hair though.
[84:28.64]Look at all these cat boys!
[84:35.85]I'll change my background, right?
[84:39.11]I'm wearing like a big elaborate like sweater today.
[84:45.13]I'm not gonna be blue.
[84:46.89]I'll be, I don't know, like green.
[84:49.61]Yeah, it's like a different day.
[85:05.58]Yeah, it's like, it's really sunny up today.
[85:07.90]You know, I just woke up in the morning.
[85:09.76]And like, this is like, it's tomorrow.
[85:19.57]I'm gonna be like, what the fuck is this?
[85:22.77]Sounds like it was bright this morning.
[85:25.15]Okay.
[85:25.39]Hold on, I need the video.
[85:40.33]I'm gonna be fucking mad that you guys linked this to me this early.
[85:48.73]No.
[85:50.68]I don't know what the fuck is this.
[85:59.09]It's too early for this, dude.
[86:06.75]It's way too early for this.
[86:07.81]I hate this.
[86:11.16]It's really quiet.
[86:12.54]I just fucking got up and you guys are linking me to this.
[86:15.92]I hate this.
[86:16.80]I hate this.
[86:18.66]I hate this.
[86:19.57]When was this?
[86:19.99]Yesterday?
[86:20.41]I hate this.
[86:22.88]I hate this.
[86:24.68]I hate this.
[86:27.24]I hate this.
[86:27.82]I hate this.
[86:28.26]Whatever.
[86:29.04]I'm going back to bed.
[86:29.82]Fucking come out of here.
[86:49.87]Beam off now.
[86:54.14]Turn off the stream now.
[86:55.92]Like I was never live.
[86:57.70]Oh, no.
[86:58.24]I have to play fucking Fear 2.
[87:05.24]I went to bed.
[87:05.90]It's tomorrow.
[87:09.15]Restart.
[87:09.73]You've ruined it.
[87:10.35]What?
[87:10.55]What do you mean restart?
[87:18.41]Do it again?
[87:20.39]You choked.
[87:21.61]In the end.
[87:22.55]You were fucked in the head.
[87:23.51]Oh, I read that wrong.
[87:24.33]I'm not even at the tutorial.
[87:31.59]Too early for this.
[87:32.41]Alright.
[87:33.77]I have to play the fucking game.
[87:39.66]Don't mind me.
[87:40.54]I'm here.
[87:41.40]But I'm Sansom.
[87:50.65]Fuck.
[87:51.25]It's just gonna do what it's gonna do and I don't even care anymore.
[87:53.55]Yes, I do.
[87:53.87]Of course I do.
[88:00.55]Alright, can I please play the game?
[88:06.91]It's been ages.
[88:29.12]I thought he said Colonel Sanders.
[88:33.16]Colonel Sanders, I've taken them out.
[88:36.12]Oh, that's good.
[88:36.74]Now come back for a $5 fill up box.
[88:43.05]We can't let them get away with the secret recipe.
[88:56.07]I need a gun.
[88:58.67]You're a budget Anakin Skywalker.
[89:02.35]That's, uh, okay.
[89:03.59]Like, do you think that's gonna make me mad or, like, pissed off or something?
[89:05.98]Why would that make me angry?
[89:08.46]The most powerful fucking Jedi on Earth.
[89:10.86]The coolest, most destructive, awesome force of a person.
[89:15.72]Budget that?
[89:17.14]That's still fucking one of the best in the world.
[89:19.68]So, I don't care.
[89:20.88]That's fine.
[89:25.17]THC lab.
[89:25.35]Alright.
[89:25.57]I know.
[89:25.86]I know.
[89:26.06]I can't believe it.
[89:27.02]I can't... No?
[89:27.48]Okay.
[89:28.04]Gotta go to the THC lab.
[90:05.62]What's this face I'm doing?
[90:08.26]Ambush.
[90:08.50]I still need a weapon.
[90:09.85]Slow mo.
[90:40.22]Is he dead?
[90:45.04]What the fuck happened to that guy?
[90:49.44]What?
[90:49.86]Why did he explode?
[90:52.94]Was he made out of glass?
[90:54.16]Oh, that's what it is.
[90:59.80]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[91:10.98]Alright, I'm fine.
[91:11.40]I don't want to hear that.
[91:20.59]X marks the spot.
[91:21.63]Nope.
[91:24.37]And links.
[91:25.13]No more links.
[91:25.65]I ain't looking at any links.
[91:27.77]No more links.

[92:49.08]It was rigor mortis.
[92:50.40]Oh.
[93:08.66]He's still alive?
[93:09.30]Okay.
[93:13.05]I'm coming to save you.
[93:18.48]Open the door.
[93:18.96]I'm here to save you.
[93:21.44]I'm here to save you.
[93:22.34]I'm here to rescue you.
[93:25.77]Ma'am, open the door.
[93:26.61]I'm here to save you.
[93:30.99]Open the door.
[93:31.53]I'm trying to get you out of here.
[93:38.98]Ma'am, I'm trying to help you.
[93:41.04]Open the door.
[93:49.16]Got any snacks in there?
[93:56.00]Watch this.
[93:57.00]Which one's gonna be left or right?
[93:59.54]Open, open, open, open!
[94:01.94]What?
[94:14.53]Dead.
[94:22.94]Is he dead before he hit the ground?
[94:35.52]No oh shits.
[94:36.41]Did they remove it?
[94:37.83]That was like the best part of the first game.
[94:43.99]Anymore?
[94:46.59]Oh shit.
[94:49.43]Open the...
[94:54.44]I fucking missed it.
[94:55.40]That was supposed to be scary and I just turned around.
[95:11.03]The camera is out of sync.
[95:12.97]It's not.
[95:22.43]It is.
[95:24.90]What the hell are you talking about?
[95:31.26]No it isn't.
[95:36.91]You made that up.
[95:47.36]They did, of course they did.
[95:48.26]I know they did.
[95:59.07]Can I get up there?
[96:00.27]Oh, go this way.
[96:04.42]Steam hurt?
[96:05.64]No, it better not.
[96:06.54]I'd be pissed if it did.
[96:09.00]Locate a working elevator to the third floor.
[96:14.16]Melee.
[96:14.80]Okay, melee.
[96:16.64]Hey, don't look over here.
[96:22.96]Come on.
[96:32.46]No, redo that part.
[96:33.42]I want to kick him down the elevator.
[96:38.06]Redo that part.
[96:38.96]I want to sneak up behind him and kick him down the elevator.
[96:48.31]Melee fans.
[96:49.03]Melee fans.
[96:50.45]Melee fans.
[96:51.85]What are you saying that for?
[96:52.67]Alright, let's go.
[96:57.45]He's literally a half second behind.
[96:58.83]That's impossible.
[97:01.17]There's nothing on there that would... This is impossible.
[97:16.15]It's impossible.
[97:16.89]And I'm not even going to give it any more thought.
[97:24.67]Okay, here we go.
[97:35.97]Just get down there already.
[97:37.23]Okay, we're good.
[97:52.74]Who's next?
[97:54.12]Got a grenade?
[98:01.72]I can't get in here?
[98:03.52]Don't even need to be in there.
[98:04.26]Who cares?
[98:06.79]It's delayed.
[98:07.49]Listen to the people.
[98:08.87]The webcam is delayed.
[98:09.91]Okay.
[98:12.83]I've had just about enough of this shit.
[98:26.38]How's that?
[98:26.68]Does that sound good?
[98:36.29]Fixed.
[98:36.73]Fixed.
[98:37.12]Worse.
[98:37.52]Worse.
[98:37.86]Oh, that's really funny because I didn't do anything at all.
[98:39.92]I just clicked the webcam on and off, pretended to change the setting, and you guys pretended it got worse.
[98:45.58]I win.
[98:58.85]I like that blue.
[98:59.61]It's a nice blue.
[99:04.28]Stop smurfing, bro.
[99:07.48]I mean, stop smurfing.
[99:08.64]There's no levels in this game.
[99:10.44]Alright.
[99:12.50]Scratch the itchy face part of my face.
[99:19.04]Got a key card.
[99:33.03]Based.
[99:33.89]You're based.

[100:23.75]How can I go in another door?
[100:25.27]How about this one?
[100:29.74]Upgrades the slow-mo duration.
[100:31.40]Oh, okay, cool.
[100:35.46]Where else am I supposed to go?
[100:36.70]Did I get everything in here?
[100:43.89]I don't actually have to move this, right?
[100:57.11]You're so bad.
[100:57.95]Dude, the heal crash is real.
[101:07.54]The heal crash.
[101:08.90]Yeah, because I had to go in here.
[101:11.44]I can't move this?
[101:27.88]Press E. I... I can't do anything.
[101:33.67]Use your brain.
[101:34.41]Use your mind.
[101:39.21]E. I don't think I, um... Where am I supposed to go?
[101:55.46]I went down here.
[101:57.86]Already been in here.
[101:58.91]Was there another keycard door going?
[102:00.57]Oh, okay.
[102:00.81]We're here.
[102:09.97]Why is everything blocked off by boxes?
[102:19.66]I win.
[102:21.02]Did I miss another jump scare?
[102:23.30]What's the cam even on for if I'm just going to miss these?
[102:34.20]Oh, that's a Monka TOS.
[102:38.14]I shot him.
[102:38.86]I stopped that.
[102:40.98]I very clearly shot that before it happened.
[102:48.13]Come on.
[102:48.57]I've played House of the Dead before.
[102:49.91]That's bullshit.
[102:52.13]I want my extra one health.
[103:05.27]Just explode.
[103:09.45]Damn.
[103:10.21]Damn.
[103:11.53]Oh, damn.
[103:24.74]Any more?
[103:28.91]Getting just blood splatters in your face and having bullets hit you in the head is way more scary than the girl walking slowly behind a glass door.
[103:41.90]Shotgun.
[103:43.86]Oh, hell yeah.
[103:44.56]Finally.
[103:45.54]It only took a hundred million years to get this.
[103:51.25]Wait, still tutorial.
[103:52.09]Right, never mind.
[104:06.72]You already shot gun.
[104:08.56]What?
[104:13.42]This way.
[104:15.84]Getting close to the lobby.
[104:17.77]There's some kind of activity.
[104:20.19]Check out the activity in the lobby.
[104:21.35]Got it.
[104:27.71]Oh, shit.
[104:48.00]I'm not that scared of this.
[105:02.29]Alright, which one is she in?
[105:03.93]We're going to unzip number one.
[105:06.55]Unzip number... No, which one are we unzipping?
[105:08.79]Who's going to come out of the morgue and who's going to grab me?
[105:19.25]Hopefully this wasn't like a prank.
[105:33.85]Alright going up.
[105:39.94]The entire game is a prank.
[105:49.46]I had a coffee.
[105:50.90]That's a problem.
[105:51.60]Now how do I get it to move?
[106:02.99]Here we go.
[106:04.23]Get to the third floor.
[106:07.22]Third floor.
[106:08.08]This would be the second floor?
[106:09.22]Is this the third floor?
[106:10.34]What floor is this?
[106:16.74]Why is it not moving anymore?
[106:26.40]Oh.
[106:28.08]What?
[106:29.78]Press and hold.
[106:30.44]I'm not soft locked.
[106:39.95]I'm fine.
[106:41.39]Lots of body armor, which I think is awesome.
[106:45.99]Alright, something behind this door.
[106:47.03]Slow-mo through here.
[106:48.45]Nope, can't go through here.
[106:50.39]Of course we can't.
[106:50.99]Of course not.
[106:58.78]There's a million clocks on the wall?
[107:10.17]Oh, shit, okay.
[107:12.21]It is exactly 3 p.m.
[107:15.44]3 o'clock.
[107:16.08]Done.
[107:16.80]See?
[107:20.24]I'll do another one.
[107:22.40]Wait, why would all the clocks be different times?
[107:38.96]Dude, the guys that explode.
[107:41.70]It's just... He wouldn't even aim it at me.
[107:48.09]That guy was playing VR.
[107:49.75]His gun was, like, bouncing all around, like, down, up, left, right.
[107:53.55]You got... Hey, you got... Sorry, dude.
[107:54.97]Room's not big enough, dude.
[107:56.27]You gotta do seated play.
[108:03.04]What does that do?
[108:07.71]Alright, frag grenade.
[108:22.59]He slowly realized that that was not going to stop an explosion from killing him.
[108:29.15]Oh, fuck.
[108:32.51]Pick it up and throw it back.
[108:36.59]Oh, geez.
[108:37.21]Hold on.
[108:37.83]That guy exploded!
[108:45.02]Look at his little... His little shimmy.
[109:08.42]I'm on fucking fire.
[109:10.50]How do I get to... Turn the sink on.
[109:16.26]Oh, you dick.
[109:20.42]This reminds me of the time that I had a ward on my finger.
[109:22.28]Me too.
[109:23.70]Wow.
[109:24.64]We're so alike.
[109:25.72]You and I. How did you miss that?
[109:35.64]There we go.
[109:43.05]It was creepy?
[109:44.13]What?
[109:48.03]No, that was like a, hey, me and you and me.
[109:50.28]We get it.
[109:55.22]That was creepy?
[110:00.76]What?
[110:01.12]You've never been like, hey, hey, hey.
[110:02.86]Hey, easy.
[110:03.86]Hey.
[110:07.44]You're an ego.
[110:12.36]You've never been like, oh, yeah, hey, we're gonna go over here.
[110:15.34]Yeah, hey, yeah, here we are.
[110:17.69]That's like a nudge, like, hey, hey, you and me.
[110:21.29]We get it.
[110:31.61]You know, ladies and gentlemen, fellas, I was begged to wink every day.
[110:42.74]Every single day of my life, I was begged to wink to you.
[110:48.80]And now all of a sudden, when you don't have to pay for it, when it's free, you don't like it anymore.
[111:03.49]What is going on there?
[111:04.75]I don't know.
[111:10.11]Thought that was a pineapple.
[111:20.29]Too bright, don't like it.
[111:20.95]Alright, where are we going?
[111:27.35]Where are we going?
[111:29.75]Get to the THC lab.
[111:37.57]Come on.
[111:37.75]Let me get into the chamber.
[111:48.25]Oh, just...
[112:09.22]Come on.
[112:13.67]Pay attention.
[112:14.23]This is like driving a car and looking over at somebody.
[112:16.27]Pay attention to the road.
[112:17.95]That guy turned into a skeleton.
[112:35.29]I'm adjusting my VR headset.
[112:36.89]I'm telling you, this is a VR game.
[112:42.65]Honey?
[112:44.16]Honey, it's dead.
[112:50.46]Simpsons thing over there?
[112:56.18]Hold on.
[112:58.90]Good morning, chickpea.
[113:01.85]You must be part of Project Harbinger.
[113:04.79]Only way to explain why Aristide would have brought you here.
[113:09.12]I wish I could slow it down.
[113:11.53]Dude, what the fuck was that?
[113:24.49]Was that a mole?
[113:25.43]Did I have somebody on the inside?
[113:30.05]Did he press the button and start firing at them?
[113:32.41]The guy on the left, what was that?
[113:41.56]Here it is!
[113:42.04]Finally!
[113:42.55]Finally, we got it!
[113:44.29]Finally, he says it!
[113:46.23]Finally!
[113:46.75]It took f- it took two hours.
[113:51.17]Holy sh- Oh, I'm so glad we get to hear it again.
[113:55.29]I missed it so much.
[114:07.28]You're just... You're just working the angle, Jerva.
[114:13.18]What's that mean?
[114:15.53]I changed the camera so it doesn't look like I'm trying to like work an angle.
[114:24.47]Is it should I put the camera somewhere else and like so I'm not like trying to make it look like I look good or something?
[114:29.43]Is that what you mean?
[114:30.19]Working with the angle like this angle?
[114:34.46]What if I sit back here?
[114:39.26]You have work in it.
[114:40.40]Oh.
[114:41.75]No, I'm... I don't... What do you mean?
[114:43.13]Dude, if only I was good at multiplayer games like this, that I could get rid of people like this.
[114:56.45]Remember, you're playing dense.
[115:00.33]I don't know... I'm 35.
[115:01.53]I don't know any words on the internet.
[115:08.54]Guys, I haven't posted a selfie of myself or, like, a picture of myself to the internet.
[115:13.71]Like, ever.
[115:15.69]The Twitter fucking Thanksgiving ham video was the last time I did it.
[115:18.55]I don't know what that means.
[115:20.19]Okay.
[115:27.03]Esoteric thanks for the 10 community subs.
[115:31.33]Thanks a lot.
[115:39.49]So two weeks ago.
[115:40.27]Yeah, and then go back to after two weeks.
[115:41.87]How long has it been?
[115:44.33]Like the years.

[116:04.62]This is what you want.
[116:05.19]This is why everybody's here.
[116:05.97]Don't fucking pretend like this is not the reason why you're here.
[116:08.79]There.
[116:20.06]Take it.
[116:20.32]Take it and run with it.
[116:24.44]This is why you're all here.
[116:25.16]Does that hurt?
[116:36.06]Ooh, we got an out-of-the-tutorial cutscene.
[116:40.02]Jerma keyboard font.
[116:41.64]I don't know what that means.
[116:43.24]Wait, you want like a... I can't... I don't... a what?
[116:45.34]You want me to make my own font?
[116:51.75]Next grenade type.
[116:54.91]Next grenade type.
[116:56.85]Incendiary grenades.
[116:58.23]Oh, shit.
[116:59.85]Oh, shit.
[117:04.76]This is very flammable.
[117:22.67]I feel like he just set that up wrong, right?
[117:25.35]I feel like I didn't even do anything.
[117:26.35]Like, I don't think that should have happened.
[117:29.56]He installed that incorrectly.
[117:41.86]The energy of your stream is off.
[117:43.30]What do you mean?
[117:48.16]Energy?
[117:49.75]What does that mean?
[117:53.09]The energy of your stream is off.
[117:55.63]Are you talking about my audio level?
[117:57.27]You need more vibes.
[118:11.38]Okay.
[118:13.59]This is for a vibe.
[118:15.29]I'm playing the game now.
[118:20.01]You're too loud.
[118:20.83]You just walk next to an explosive.
[118:27.24]Well, I'm not paying attention to the road right now.
[118:29.82]I'm talking to one of the passengers in the car here.
[118:32.52]So, like, this is what I'm talking about.
[118:33.94]Alright, hold on.
[118:38.51]Watch this.
[118:38.83]Ready?
[118:57.78]You know... Alright, so... Somebody was just like, you know what?
[119:09.68]I'm... I'm gonna kill both of them.
[119:11.30]Because, like, this is the chance I got.
[119:12.70]And, fuck it.
[119:13.36]He's standing... He's standing there still.
[119:15.80]So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go for it.
[119:20.60]Harry, I'm sorry.
[119:21.74]But, I... This is the guy.
[119:23.60]And, I'm just going for it.
[119:24.56]He's standing still.
[119:38.80]Why am I shaking?
[119:43.98]I love it so much.
[120:00.05]The whole stream is a prank.
[120:02.55]I don't think so.
[120:10.47]That was a, that was a default.
[120:11.73]Holy shit.
[120:16.10]What can I pick?
[120:17.72]Why can't I pick this up?
[120:21.58]How the... Okay.
[120:26.37]How come I can't pick that grenade up?
[120:31.89]Different grenade type.
[120:32.67]Yeah.
[120:32.95]I have, wasn't, wasn't I holding five?
[120:36.41]If your vibes were better, you could get it.
[120:38.99]What?
[120:39.25]We guys aren't... What is this crack that I'm seeing?
[120:46.59]Oh, fuck.
[120:49.60]Got him.
[120:53.04]Okay, we're good.
[121:07.08]What is he doing?
[121:08.57]What the fuck?
[121:13.49]He looked at it and it made him catch on fire.
[121:17.01]Why?
[121:18.69]Whatever.
[121:19.01]Oh, hey, look, we got good vibes now.
[121:37.85]I wish I go in here.
[121:41.15]I heard grenade.
[121:47.51]Why did that last so long?
[121:58.10]Good vibes and chill.
[122:00.30]Yeah, that's true.
[122:01.72]That's what I'm talking about.
[122:02.50]Boom.
[122:11.78]Yeah, we're just chilling out.
[122:12.68]What are you guys talking about?
[122:14.12]Oh, I gotta use the shotgun for a little while.
[122:16.15]Hold on, wait.
[122:20.41]Live, laugh, love.
[122:26.03]Hard mode.
[122:26.43]This is too easy, please.
[122:27.47]No, I don't... We're just vibing, right?
[122:32.74]We're just hanging out.
[122:33.30]I say it and everybody gets mad.
[122:41.33]Nice.
[122:41.77]Thank God.
[122:43.17]I was gonna be so mad if I couldn't hit that phone off the wall.
[122:47.49]Okay, where... Beers?
[122:47.93]What?
[123:11.45]Hold on.
[123:11.69]Wait, did he just respond to that by saying shit?
[123:17.75]Is it good?
[123:18.09]Is it good?
[123:22.10]What the fuck is going on?
[123:31.47]Oh, he didn't throw it very far.
[123:36.03]Back up, back up.
[123:42.72]Do I have health?
[123:43.14]What's with all the smoke?
[123:51.75]There's smoke just everywhere.
[123:52.65]Okay, hold on.
[123:53.19]Give me the shotgun again.
[123:56.25]What happened?
[124:05.63]What was that?
[124:09.36]Did I shoot myself in like the chin?
[124:14.59]What?
[124:18.30]What the hell was that?
[124:31.91]It was the fire?
[124:32.67]Wait, those explode that far?
[124:36.15]That's crazy.
[124:38.39]That's not what it was.
[124:42.75]No, guys, that was not what it was.
[124:43.89]I want to check that out.
[124:45.39]Alright, hold on.
[124:54.25]That's a huge explosion.
[124:55.65]It was what it was.
[124:56.57]Okay.
[124:57.83]I did not think that was going to happen.
[125:03.51]Nothing?
[125:03.85]Okay.
[125:04.49]Down here.
[125:08.13]How the fuck do you do that?
[125:09.90]I don't know.
[125:19.32]Somebody said it's okay.
[125:20.64]Vibes stable.
[125:25.92]Thank God.
[125:26.54]I thought that was a clown.
[125:39.42]I'm going to be honest.
[125:39.96]I thought that was a clown.
[125:44.80]Whoops.
[125:52.28]What's he doing?
[125:52.84]What's he reaching for?
[125:54.06]What are you doing?
[125:58.14]Why does... What the fuck is this guy?
[126:07.02]What the fuck did I... Die!
[126:15.61]Okay.
[126:16.31]Give me that thing.
[126:16.95]Charges set in alarm.
[126:28.64]Ah!
[126:32.34]Oh shit, nice!
[126:32.96]Let's do a spy check.
[126:36.93]He's doing the thing the stuntman does in every movie.
[126:52.66]This thing, when they're on fire and they just go like this, they're engulfed in fucking flames and they just do the... And they just slowly are taking one or two little steps at a time because it's like, holy shit, this is a real dude and he's really on fire.
[127:14.76]So you have to be really careful.
[127:20.88]imagine being in that suit though and just knowing like holy shit I am completely engulfed in fire the whole everything from head to toe I am I am I am a golem from I'm a golem I'm the fire golem from Diablo II not a golem that's what I was trying to say golem from Diablo II fire golem
[127:44.06]It would have been... You would have understood if I said it faster without stopping and going... And then blocking it in my brain.
[128:00.28]Delay is getting even worse.
[128:04.48]Okay.
[128:08.40]Sure thing.
[128:12.28]Fix it, idiot.
[128:15.59]I don't know how.
[128:19.25]Fucking idiot streamer can't do anything.
[128:26.23]Fucking idiot.
[128:28.35]Alright, Shotcut!
[129:03.50]Oh no, vibe levels are critical.
[129:05.92]What do I do to fix the vibe levels?
[129:10.76]Why does he move his whole body to dodge things?
[129:12.42]Because, I don't know, that's from Super Mario.
[129:17.97]I got it from my mother.
[129:19.15]Anytime my mother wanted to, uh, make a, like a jump across like a platform or something, she would always do this.
[129:26.43]So she would be running, right?
[129:27.43]Like Mario's like running across the screen and she would jump and she'd go and it somehow helped to help her get to the other side somehow.
[129:37.07]And I don't know.
[129:37.59]It's just that it stuck with me.
[129:42.76]Mama.
[129:43.18]That's right.
[129:49.50]That guy was terrible.
[129:58.84]He's alive?
[130:07.12]Shit.
[130:07.92]Grenade.
[130:16.93]What?
[130:17.49]Okay.
[130:17.77]I was going to say that didn't kill...
[130:24.63]This game's like fun though.
[130:25.83]I actually kind of like this.
[130:28.43]You kicked at his ankles and it killed him.
[130:30.14]Yeah.
[130:30.44]Well, he only had like two health left.
[130:31.94]What is it?
[130:39.18]Oh no.
[130:39.50]His vibe levels.
[130:41.80]His telestatic vibe levels are critical right now.
[130:44.72]They're off the charts at the moment.
[130:45.94]Easy.
[130:59.35]I've been here.
[131:08.13]Will he know that the grenades behind him?
[131:10.27]Trying to run away.
[131:31.07]Where did that guy go?
[131:54.53]Holy shit, that was...
[132:06.26]That was so fucking bad.
[132:08.14]That was so shitty.
[132:11.48]That was like... There was just no way he was gonna be in the bathroom.
[132:15.53]You know what I mean?
[132:18.01]There was no reason anyone was gonna be in here.
[132:24.69]In fact, I think that's actually the guy.
[132:26.52]Somebody said, town NPC death sound.
[132:43.53]Like you walked up to like one of the villagers and just like stabbed him God damn it Can we hear it does anybody have it
[133:08.87]This stream has been all over the fucking place.

[133:13.42]For what?
[133:16.94]Links are banned?
[133:18.12]Oh shit, because I was getting spammed.
[133:22.77]Oh my god.
[133:25.31]Oh, not even dead?
[133:26.07]That's just like you, a NPC in town runs away.
[133:29.87]Because you pressed Z and unholstered your shotgun, right?
[133:33.66]And it's just like, CRAZY GUY!
[133:36.06]RUN!
[133:39.35]Like, that's in Red Dead, you know what I mean?
[133:40.93]Like, you have the holster and you, like, pull it out and all of a sudden people are just like, WAAAH!
[133:50.74]Well, Link's a band, whatever.
[133:51.70]In the saloon, you just open the door.
[134:06.85]I didn't even do that!
[134:08.55]Did I do that?
[134:09.88]Did I kill that guy?
[134:13.22]Was that scripted or did I shoot him?
[134:17.02]I didn't do that!
[134:17.84]Is the guy's head talking?
[134:28.53]This guy's head is screaming!
[134:41.21]What was that?
[134:44.21]You just kicked me like... I can't... Why are you doing this?
[134:59.90]Stop doing this!
[135:06.62]Where are they coming from?
[135:08.34]Stop spawning!
[135:16.88]I need a break.
[135:17.40]I need to take a break.
[135:18.92]I don't even know where they're going.
[135:25.46]Why are they all limping?
[135:27.06]Why is every NPC limping?
[135:29.12]I'm going to crazy pills.
[135:48.50]Okay.
[135:50.82]Every NPC is limping.
[136:08.33]Okay, that was a little scary.
[136:10.11]I'm kind of concerned about that.
[136:13.08]I'm a little concerned.
[136:26.33]What happened to that guy?
[136:26.89]That guy's head's gone.
[136:35.01]Oh, shit.

[141:36.81]We're good.
[141:37.17]We're fine.
[141:37.45]We're fine.
[141:43.64]You can't just bite me and then run away.
[141:49.31]What is he doing?
[141:49.91]He's trying to get a hiding spot.
[141:51.85]Give me the shotgun.
[141:58.48]Shotgun better.
[142:01.56]Oh, yeah.
[142:01.90]Ah.
[142:19.72]They're like little dogs.
[142:26.74]Okay, get out.
[142:27.36]Out, out, out, out.
[142:27.88]Move, move, move.
[142:33.21]Through the ceiling.
[142:33.69]Here we go.
[142:34.07]One, two, three.
[142:35.83]No.
[142:36.05]Okay, we're fine.
[142:43.21]What's going on with this guy?
[142:46.77]Can I do anything with this guy?
[142:49.13]No.
[142:49.41]This guy's just dead.
[142:50.09]Why are they filming this?
[142:57.72]Get that out of here.
[142:58.32]What the fuck?
[143:03.19]Yep.
[143:03.55]I knew it.
[143:04.15]I was waiting for it.
[143:18.96]Oh, you're gonna do it.
[143:19.68]It's gonna... Didn't do it.
[143:26.15]Wow, okay.
[143:26.45]I'm actually pretty surprised that they did not do that.
[143:28.98]Oh, okay.
[143:30.16]Cutscene.
[143:39.92]Remember, you promised us Sly Cooper.
[143:41.20]When is Sly Cooper?
[143:42.06]Yeah, I fucked it up.
[143:43.97]My PS3.
[143:44.77]Alright, those either weren't here.
[143:46.49]My PlayStation 3 smelled like burnt plastic when I played anything.
[143:51.49]So, I had to try to find a solution to it.
[143:55.31]When I play with my PlayStation 3, it smells like burnt plastic.
[143:58.12]Bad.
[143:58.82]To a point where it makes me feel like a headache.
[144:00.14]So, I can't use it.
[144:02.10]So, I gotta figure out what to do.
[144:05.72]This button will toggle power to the doors.
[144:07.42]Okay.
[144:09.76]Oh, I just locked him.
[144:13.04]And the x-ray, okay.
[144:24.05]What are they doing?
[144:24.67]Ugh.
[144:30.68]Do an emulator.
[144:31.78]I actually tried to use an emulator.
[144:34.42]But I got a ton of awful interlacing.
[144:36.76]And it was just ugly and horrible to look at.
[144:38.84]I tried to do a bunch of different settings.
[144:40.58]Tried to change what it looked like.
[144:42.97]Just wasn't happy with it.
[144:44.15]Until I can do that.
[144:47.97]I'm just going to get another PlayStation 3.
[144:48.99]This is open.
[144:59.99]Yeah, it was really just ugly frames of blending and it was there's a lot of weird ghosting and blending and I just like I I'll just buy another ps3 Jerma put art on so I can eat.
[145:13.66]Um, I'll take a break in like 20 minutes Oh, we're out

[146:21.99]Alright, he's got a broken leg.
[146:26.52]A broken collarbone.
[146:29.92]And a broken jaw.
[146:30.86]Okay.
[146:33.98]Fix him.
[146:35.50]I can't.
[146:42.81]I'm not a doctor.
[146:43.41]Can I squeeze through?
[146:47.26]I cannot squeeze through that.
[146:50.62]Play Mega Man.
[146:57.09]No, not right now.
[147:01.45]Get out of here.
[147:16.37]It's quiet.
[147:16.97]It's too quiet.

[148:38.92]Well, really painting the barn.
[148:40.32]I don't even know what that means.
[148:51.47]Gunplay is pretty good in this game though.
[148:52.81]I like the gunplay.
[149:01.07]It's really responsive.
[149:02.01]Really responsive gunplay.
[149:05.39]See, when I say the word gunplay enough times, you guys will then respect my review coming later because I said that word.
[149:10.76]And you guys go, oh, yeah, he knows what that means.

[149:16.06]Is this guy locked in here?
[149:34.43]Okay.
[149:36.45]Careful.
[149:36.79]You have to compare this to Dark Souls?
[149:42.60]I don't think I can do that.
[149:43.54]I'm not sure that's possible.
[149:46.26]I don't think I can compare this to Dark Souls.
[149:49.66]He has an extension cord in his body.
[149:53.47]That's what that is, right?

[155:06.59]I mean, you get so many of them and they do so much damage.
[155:09.33]Why wouldn't I use them?
[155:18.90]I think I've thrown 70 or 80 grenades in this playthrough so far.
[155:22.61]They're just everywhere.
[155:24.09]Why not just use them?
[155:24.81]Of course I'm going to throw them.
[155:41.64]Um, what?
[155:46.45]I don't know what that was, but apparently that guy killed the other guy somehow?
[155:49.45]His body?
[155:49.99]I don't know.
[155:56.72]His corpse was breakdancing.
[156:03.15]Okay, new shock grenade.

[157:32.70]Who's driving the forklift?
[157:34.65]What the fuck?
[157:39.01]Some guys just like back it up with the forklift.
[157:47.22]How do you feel about your cyberpunk cameo?
[157:49.22]I don't have a cyberpunk cameo.

[158:48.10]The music is kind of overpowering my brain.
[158:49.82]Throw more grenades.
[158:57.19]I'm already throwing a bunch of grenades, man.
[159:24.53]It's too much stimulation.
[159:25.51]It's a lot of stimulation.
[159:26.79]Too much.
[159:29.25]It's too much stimulation.
[159:35.45]This guy's still alive.
[159:36.39]Is that guy alive?
[159:49.98]Wait.
[159:50.46]No, get down.

[162:00.79]I feel like I'm playing on a tiny map in a shooter game, and people are just spawning and killing each other.
[162:06.38]Spawn, die.
[162:07.26]Spawn, die.
[162:07.86]Spawn, die, die.

[167:55.37]Stop!
[167:56.23]No!
[167:56.61]I wanted to do that.
[167:57.33]That's what it feels like to be an NPC in this game.
[168:14.28]You suck.
[168:15.02]I'm fine.
[168:15.54]Find a way out.
[168:17.93]Okay.

[168:25.02]Just give me a second.
[168:25.68]I gotta find like a swamp creature or something in here.
[168:29.18]It's gonna be like a swamp monster I can say yell at or something, right?
[168:33.18]Do one.
[168:34.02]Just wait a minute.
[168:36.08]Alright, here she comes.
[168:45.62]That's what you're using to hold the papers down?
[168:51.00]Like, get a filing cabinet.
[168:54.64]Why is this like a caveman?
[168:56.28]Like a caveman works in the office?
[168:58.56]Put this in a filing cabinet.
[169:04.27]Use big rock.
[169:05.27]Keep papers down.
[169:08.63]Uh, Chungo, can you please put those in the filing cabinet?
[169:13.01]Filing cabinet?
[169:13.81]Scary.
[169:15.08]Make loud noise when open door.
[169:17.64]That's just the wheels are a little... We'll put some WD-40 on it.
[169:21.58]Remind me of Giant Bird.
[169:24.02]Okay.
[169:36.34]Someone else will read it.
[169:39.41]Chunk.
[169:46.17]Ah!
[169:47.41]Scary!
[169:55.40]That actually was scarier.
[170:00.98]Fake?
[170:02.14]Yeah, and... Like, very overdone.
[170:11.58]It's a little guy from Overwatch.
[170:13.96]It's an arm.
[170:15.62]He builds a sentry Torbjörn.
[170:18.25]This is an arm, right?
[170:30.88]How do I get this open?
[170:37.70]It wasn't.
[170:38.14]-2.
[170:38.60]-2.
[170:39.13]Whatever.
[170:41.14]He said make a joke.
[170:42.16]He didn't say make a good one.
[170:44.08]That wasn't clear.
[170:44.78]Is there something I can press in here or activate?
[170:58.26]Why is the chat adding and subtracting?
[171:00.06]Well, they're trying to tell me how good or bad I am doing streaming.
[171:07.00]That's pretty much what it is.
[171:10.85]It's a point system.
[171:14.49]If I say something that's not funny, they take points away from me, which makes me very upset.
[171:19.75]But if they like what I say, they add points, which makes me very happy.
[171:25.98]New viewer song.
[171:31.26]Welcome to the channel.
[171:32.02]I hate that.
[171:32.72]I'll clear that.
[171:33.48]I'm not doing this.
[171:34.58]I'm not going to do that anymore.
[171:41.80]I'm not gonna be like the guy with the sound board that makes fucking sounds!
[171:50.07]Where do I go?
[171:50.49]I have to get this open somehow.
[172:01.63]Oh.
[172:07.39]Be that guy, please.
[172:08.61]Live your dreams.
[172:24.13]Get off me.
[172:29.67]Hey, get away from me.
[172:39.12]Nice gameplay.
[172:41.54]Don't play me.
[172:45.67]Oh, the little dog golem guys are here.
[172:56.74]Data.
[172:56.94]Now she's drawn to me?
[172:57.88]A coveter.
[172:58.30]You are coveted.
[172:59.56]Okay.
[173:22.81]But does it have to be an anime convention?
[173:24.45]I feel like that would be, like, if I was just sitting in my room and I smelled that, I would want it.
[173:29.98]Like, if we had the doctor in the doctor's office, and if I smelled pizza, I'm gonna be like, holy shit, doc, you got pizza in here?
[173:35.34]Yeah.
[173:37.56]Would you want a slice?
[173:41.08]Of course.
[173:41.82]Like, it doesn't matter where you are.
[173:52.97]okay imagine you went for like just a routine checkup for the doctor and they came in with like a little paper plate and a slice of pizza on it and they were like do you want this I would eat it I'd be like alright well a doctor is giving this to me I would definitely eat it like if this was a random person on the street and they were just like hey you want a slice of pizza
[174:17.40]No, I don't know who the fuck you are.
[174:18.56]Get away from me.
[174:19.00]You're just a random person.
[174:21.54]You might be a doctor.
[174:22.20]I don't know.
[174:23.29]If a doctor is handing you a slice of pizza, it's probably going to be okay.
[174:28.05]At least, that's what I would think.
[174:31.29]He's already examined it to make sure there's nothing on it, nothing wrong with it.
[174:33.95]It's actually the only way American doctors can administer... Wait, what?
[174:47.19]I didn't even see what you said.
[174:52.03]Alright, so how do I get in here?
[174:56.78]It has drugs in it.
[174:57.80]I just... What did I just turn on?
[175:04.80]Something upstairs?
[175:05.34]I don't see a door over here.
[175:09.19]I hear lots of... I hear lots of mouth noises.
[175:20.72]Alright, I think it's up.
[175:24.59]It's just chat's mouth breathing.
[176:00.05]Not a big deal.
[176:00.75]We're fine.
[176:03.01]Get away.
[176:03.41]Is she here?
[176:03.93]Is that her?
[176:10.81]No, I want pizza.
[176:12.40]Oh, yeah, guys.
[176:13.84]Alright.

[177:02.30]That didn't kill you?
[177:03.18]How?
[177:13.53]That does not look comfortable.
[177:14.89]Um... That guy... His head just snaked around.
[177:34.34]I don't think so.
[177:35.16]Get out of here.
[177:44.47]Is he dead?
[177:56.72]Oh, that's bad.
[177:58.82]Get him down.
[177:59.22]I have to blow him up.
[178:06.14]That didn't even work.
[178:06.86]Whatever.
[178:07.14]Okay.
[178:07.74]Um... Okay, so what do I do now?
[178:13.71]Just go up?
[178:35.76]Just order from a pizza place.
[178:36.76]It'll be 20 times better than main chains.

[180:01.45]That's weird for me to say, but I don't even care.
[180:03.05]People are like, oh man, Chuck E. Cheese pizza, it's so gross.
[180:05.40]You know, do you hear that they like take pizza from other pizzas and put it and make it a new pizza and serve it to you?
[180:09.84]I don't care.
[180:11.78]I don't even care.
[180:12.34]Just give me that.
[180:12.82]I want it.
[180:15.80]I could eat a Chuck E. Cheese pizza right now.
[180:17.50]The whole thing.
[180:33.89]Why am I on fire?
[180:34.63]What?
[180:37.55]Do a pizza eating stream.
[180:39.15]I would.
[180:39.49]I would.
[180:39.87]I would cut it.
[180:41.15]I'd get like one of those big pizza knives and just go...
[180:45.07]I would actually ask the restaurant.
[180:46.33]I'd say, hey, can you make me a pizza?
[180:48.11]Don't cut it, though.
[180:49.21]I want to cut it.
[180:51.89]Just give me the big circle with just the cheese and everything.
[180:54.84]I want to be the one to cut it because I want to have to go like and put my hand down on the knife and go like down.
[181:03.58]That's what I want.
[181:09.54]I'm so hungry now.
[181:11.12]What do I do?
[181:14.76]Damn it.
[181:15.58]I'm so hungry.
[181:16.18]I'm going to have to get a streamer snack.
[181:17.22]I'm going to have to get a streamer snack.
[181:25.78]Hey, I'm on here.
[181:31.08]Get out of here.
[181:33.16]What are you doing?
[181:37.83]I need a streamer snack.
[181:38.85]I need one right now.
[181:40.73]Alright, I'm going to get a streamer snack.
[181:42.21]Everybody relax.
[181:45.65]That was weird.
[181:49.87]How did you open the door?
[181:50.69]Where the fuck did you come from?
[181:53.79]Did he just drink a bunch of stuff?
[182:03.34]This is like in Gremlins when they're just drinking all the potions in the scientist room.
[182:16.97]Would you wink for us for a streamer snack?
[182:20.18]Um, I'll... No, I just want... I'm just gonna get some food.
[182:22.00]I'll be back.
[182:28.13]Alright.
[182:28.87]Streamer snack time.
[182:30.88]Up here, baby.
[185:41.83]I got some really really bad news I don't have any more jerky sticks I gotta eat I gotta eat almonds it's hot I gotta buy I gotta get more jerky sticks it's like my favorite
[186:10.25]So now I'm just going to eat almonds until I can't breathe anymore.
[186:15.30]I'm going to fill my body with almonds.
[186:16.66]Something funny about almonds.
[186:22.80]Did you know that they were the most calorically dense snack?
[186:27.17]They got a good amount of protein.
[186:29.97]They've got a ton of calories.
[186:31.73]And they're really good for you.
[186:32.59]If you really want to get filled up, have some almonds.
[186:38.88]I just fucking dropped a bunch of them all over the ground.
[186:45.04]God, this is not a good streamer snack though.
[186:53.61]Plus, this is such a bad streamer snack.
[186:55.59]What was I thinking?
[186:58.25]These are wasabi and soy sauce almonds.
[187:01.25]And they have like a film on them.
[187:03.33]And it's going to get all over my hands.
[187:16.98]Look at it.
[187:17.45]It's already happening.
[187:20.19]They have this Cheeto dust on them.
[187:25.25]I fucking hate when people watch me eat.
[187:30.49]I just picked up two of them and now I can't even play the game anymore.
[187:35.90]And I don't want to put my hands in my mouth because somebody will clip it and they'll enhance it and they'll make it huge and they'll use it somewhere.
[187:42.30]And I don't want you to do that.
[187:48.56]Look, this is ridiculous.
[187:49.88]I just took another handful out.
[187:51.10]Like, this is ridiculous.
[187:53.08]That's ridiculous.
[187:54.80]It's all of my hands, too.
[187:58.45]I need a strategy.
[188:01.07]What's the strategy here?
[188:12.45]You didn't see that.
[188:14.99]Use a fork and knife?
[188:16.29]Knife?
[188:19.39]A fork and knife.
[188:26.25]A fork and Nike.
[188:28.55]Yeah, you hold it with the fork and step on it and it'll grind it up and you could eat it.
[188:35.32]I'm just saying, hold on, give me a second.
[188:42.06]Pour them into a cup.
[188:43.38]Wow, you're a fucking genius.
[188:45.00]Too late.
[188:46.74]Too late.
[189:01.22]Who goes over there?
[189:12.10]Good dog.
[189:17.76]Alright, one more handful and I'll play.
[189:21.40]You hear how crunchy these are?
[189:28.93]I don't want it to pick up on the mic.
[189:29.93]I'm trying to make it not happen.

[200:34.78]felt.
[200:35.02]Was there somebody in there?

[200:54.31]Did I win?
[201:10.87]I won.
[201:15.27]Shoot and make a noise at the same time.
[201:28.29]Clip that to me right now.
[201:29.63]Do it right now.
[201:30.17]I want to see it right now.
[201:33.56]Oh.

[201:42.82]Yeah, somebody show that to me.
[201:44.28]Bullshit.
[201:50.82]No, this is not even the right clip.
[201:51.90]I want to see the one I just did.
[201:55.66]Not scary.
[201:56.24]This is not it.
[201:56.54]This is the wrong one.
[201:59.62]There it is.
[201:59.92]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[202:02.50]Webcam is delayed.
[202:03.54]Yeah, you would know.
[202:04.38]Alright, so here we go.
[202:08.94]And if anybody talks, after we watch this clip, if anybody talks about
[202:13.05]It being an audio delay, you're going to get timed out for 200 days.
[202:17.66]Okay?
[202:20.82]Okay.
[202:21.24]I'm glad we have an understanding.
[202:29.05]Oh, no.
[202:29.21]Oh.
[202:44.63]Let's find out.
[202:53.46]I won.
[202:57.82]Shoot and make a noise at the same time.
[203:09.37]It's fine.
[203:10.43]What's wrong with it?
[203:11.10]I don't see the issue.
[203:20.37]Okay, wait, you're talking about my... The FPS is a little slower.
[203:26.65]The video's not delayed.
[203:27.79]It's like a 20 FPS.
[203:32.29]Because the camera sucks.
[203:43.72]Here, ready?
[203:44.10]Let's see if I can fix this.
[203:49.91]I don't think you guys even really care either.
[203:51.23]I feel like this is just a way to get me to, like, stop playing the game and, like, do something else to, like, fucking burn time.
[204:02.19]How's this?
[204:21.05]That better?
[204:21.35]That's better, right?
[204:36.22]Up, up, oop, up, up, up.
[204:40.41]Up, up, oop, up, up, up, up.
[204:42.77]Up, up, up.
[204:48.11]Better.
[204:48.71]Fixed.
[204:49.34]It's just the FPS.
[204:50.18]I turned the FPS up.
[204:51.20]I wanted to slow the FPS down because I got a 1080 and my 1080 sucks.
[204:54.70]And it's burning out.
[204:56.70]It smells like burning plastic in here.
[204:58.66]No, it doesn't.
[204:59.08]I'm kidding.
[204:59.40]Alright.
[205:11.53]Sing the national anthem to prove it's fixed.
[205:19.83]Oh, you joker.
[205:21.01]Alright, let's go.
[205:23.47]How do I leave?
[205:24.01]Did one of these open?
[205:29.55]Can I go down?
[205:29.99]The one that fell over, right?
[205:31.85]Can I go down one of these?
[205:32.91]Did the door open or am I missing something?
[205:36.12]There we go.
[205:45.16]National Anthem.
[205:46.00]Oh my god.
[205:48.66]Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous night o'er the
[206:17.74]Pots waved at the straw lights last gleaming The bombs bursting in Gave proof through the night
[206:47.18]That our flag was still there.
[206:53.13]Oh, shit.
[206:56.11]Oh, say does that star.
[207:04.03]I have ADHD.
[207:04.91]I can't complete it.
[207:05.53]You know how hard it is to sing the national anthem like in front of people?
[207:17.22]I get it now.
[207:17.70]You know how people just... That guy was coming out of the bathroom.
[207:20.40]You know how people like just... They mess it up all... And it's like, well, how did you mess that up?
[207:23.64]It's... It's actually like... When you're in front of a bunch of people, you have to like kind of remember.
[207:29.19]And there's like two major breaks in the National Anthem.
[207:32.43]That you think it's going to be when the rockets red glare, but it's not that point yet.
[207:41.85]And you get caught.
[207:42.45]You're like, oh, there's another verse, right?
[207:45.07]Shit.
[207:53.69]What about Canada?
[207:55.07]Sure.
[207:57.83]Oh, Canada, our hearts and sacred lands, true, and all thy sons command.
[208:11.32]Through glowing hearts we see thy stone, the true north, young and free.
[208:18.83]While sloppy joes are food we eat, our sunshine shines on thee.
[208:29.08]God.
[208:29.78]I don't know.
[208:31.20]I don't live in Canada.
[208:37.60]That was rush.
[208:43.03]That was corrupt.
[208:45.45]That was corrupt.
[208:56.77]I'm not even giving you guys a chance.
[208:58.01]How about Russia?
[209:02.87]I don't know any... I don't know Russia at all.
[209:04.51]What about England?
[209:16.68]I have no idea.
[209:17.98]I don't even know how the English anthem starts.
[209:20.26]Is it God Save the Queen?

[211:06.26]You know that?
[211:06.60]That was a long jump.
[211:19.39]Is it not supposed to do that?
[211:26.30]Oh, a proximity mine!
[211:27.22]I only have one?
[211:32.02]You're gonna regret saying that.
[211:35.94]Why?

[211:40.96]Got a big mouth.
[211:46.11]It is, it's huge.
[211:50.22]Like, if you were to take, like, just a cut of this down, like, right here, and, like, match it up to, like, Steven Tyler, you'd be the same image.
[211:59.86]We both have, like, these big, like, Steven Tyler-esque kind of mouths.
[212:15.57]Alright, get me out of here.
[212:16.53]I don't want to play this part.
[212:18.19]I want the part where the girl screams in your face.

[212:40.40]God, this game stinks.
[213:03.20]Play something else?
[213:04.92]Um, I kind of want to beat this.
[213:10.56]I feel like I'm more than halfway through the game right now.
[213:18.61]And I beat the first one, so I can't give up on the second one.
[213:21.39]That's not how that's gonna work.
[213:22.47]Do I have to jump on these or something?
[213:30.34]Or ride one?
[213:33.08]Give up.
[213:33.36]The game's only... Guys, this game's only like six and a half hours.
[213:46.65]That's too many.
[213:47.25]I feel like this should open.
[213:54.80]But you're slow.
[213:56.18]Whatever.
[213:56.54]I can stream it tomorrow.
[213:57.32]We're fine.
[213:57.62]There we are.
[213:59.80]He's never going to play Saw 2.
[214:03.78]Why would I ever play the worst game I've ever played on stream?
[214:06.34]That is by far the worst game I've probably ever played.
[214:09.18]I was so angry with that game.
[214:10.26]I hate that game.
[214:11.87]I hate that game.
[214:15.97]That game is dog shit.
[214:19.49]Like, I'm sorry.
[214:20.07]I just have to be real.
[214:25.50]Who did that?
[214:31.58]Nobody with a gun.
[214:32.62]Who has a gun over here?
[214:33.42]That was weird looking.
[214:41.31]How did a bullet hole end up over there?
[214:45.33]What?
[214:48.97]Wait, is this a different military?
[214:50.57]It's like the military 2?
[214:51.53]Why are they fighting each other?
[215:00.70]Why are these guys fighting each other?
[215:05.62]Oh, stop.

[216:07.29]Okay, press 1 if you are not from North America or Europe.
[216:18.26]Okay.
[216:19.40]Really, that seems like a lot.
[216:33.91]I lied.
[216:34.61]Oh.

[217:23.86]Oh, you know, um, I think that, like, all the different countries in the world, they have different interesting things, and, uh, like, food, and culture, and... This globalist, he wants to have, like, one currency across the whole world, and then he also, he wants to, this guy definitely wants to eat all everybody's kids.
[217:41.40]I just, I didn't say any of that.
[217:53.59]You know, Japan probably sure has good food.
[217:56.71]This guy's coming.
[217:57.83]He wants us all to fucking wear all the same clothes and eat all the same food.
[218:00.65]He wants us all to use the same money.
[218:02.78]We're all going to die.
[218:04.24]I have a trip maybe coming up soon to go there.
[218:19.50]Just kind of interesting to see what's there.
[218:31.00]Oh, what a based, he's a based liberal.
[218:36.72]You don't know me.
[218:38.82]You don't know who, you don't know who I am.
[218:40.84]Come in.
[218:52.65]You don't know who I am.
[219:03.58]I'm confused.
[219:04.06]You didn't say you wanted to leave, didn't you?
[219:05.85]You said, did you not say you wanted to leave the U.S.?
[219:07.91]Wait, what?
[219:10.81]He's a communist.
[219:17.03]That's it.
[219:18.57]No more talking.
[219:22.35]No more talking, everybody.
[219:24.21]No more talking.
[219:35.14]No, I've, okay.
[219:36.60]I, let me say this again.
[219:38.58]For the, everyone that said, oh, wait, he must be a communist.
[219:42.24]Guy that lost, like, I'm like a cryptocurrency stock trader that lost his money.
[219:46.39]You know what I mean?
[219:46.81]Like, I'm, you're talking to the guy that, like, tried to bet against Beyond Meat.
[219:50.67]You think that's the communist?
[220:06.72]But he's a capitalist!
[220:14.53]He's Wall Street Pets.
[220:23.46]Get him?
[220:24.74]What do you mean, get him?
[220:27.32]Oh.
[220:28.62]Really?
[220:31.36]Really?
[220:31.68]You seen an arm that big before?
[220:41.84]pain to make it look like that.
[220:43.06]That took a lot of squishing as hard as I could up against my chest and popping out the muscle as hard as I could to maybe cause a problem later in an hour or two from now.
[221:02.99]You want my political beliefs?
[221:04.65]I'm going to say them.
[221:05.47]See if you can lip read them.
[221:24.83]I've never played Wind Waker before.
[221:26.65]I've never played Wind Waker.
[221:44.21]You ain't missing anything.
[221:55.53]I laughed because that guy's about to get, like, decimated.
[222:00.13]I wasn't laughing in an agreeance.
[222:01.43]I was laughing in the, dude, you know I have to run down the street with, like, the fucking crowd behind you.
[222:08.92]And I'm just looking out the window through the blinds going, like, oh, that dude's fucked.
[222:12.16]Alright, where am I going?
[222:24.10]Still up there, by the way.
[222:30.76]Why is there so much armor?
[222:31.66]There's nobody even here.
[222:32.48]Oh, automatic shotgun.
[222:35.41]Hell yeah.
[222:39.37]Auto shoddy.
[222:41.31]Play Wind Waker.
[222:42.79]I knew that was going to be a problem.
[222:47.92]Alright, what do I do here?
[222:49.22]Am I missing something?
[222:50.66]Oh, this is like an elevator?
[222:51.90]What's wrong with me?
[222:54.90]What am I doing?
[222:55.57]Up?
[222:55.65]Can I go up top?
[222:59.76]Auto shoddy.
[223:01.27]Yeah, that's what I said.
[223:07.79]I'll look at it.
[223:08.27]I will.
[223:08.67]Just give me a sec.
[223:12.45]My eyes are like... Oh, they look watery.
[223:17.49]This is a gorillas photo.
[223:18.72]I've seen it.
[223:20.96]Stop playing this 1.5 billion.
[223:23.04]We want Saw 2.
[223:23.66]It's not going to happen.
[223:24.54]No.
[223:27.34]I would- I would rather you fucking... Like, punch me in the stomach as hard as you could.
[223:33.80]Than play Saw II.
[223:48.05]Deal?
[223:48.55]No, that's not a deal.
[223:49.71]No, that's not a- Imagine lining up like being at TwitchCon.
[223:58.74]I have, like, a booth at TwitchCon to just, like, punch me in the stomach.
[224:04.12]And I'm in one of those, like, old-timey, like, spandex outfits.
[224:08.70]The dude that got... The cannonball used to shoot the guy in the stomach.
[224:15.15]I honestly have no idea where the hell I'm supposed to go.
[224:19.89]I don't see any, like, doors or anything.
[224:25.12]Down or something?
[224:25.82]Up?
[224:26.52]Can I spin this?
[224:32.94]Where do I go?
[224:34.89]I would not do that because your body is being held together with tape and dreams.
[224:42.43]Fuck this game.
[224:43.19]Hold on.
[224:43.57]Wait, I know, I know, I know.
[224:44.59]I gotta find a way.
[224:45.29]Let me pay attention.
[224:46.27]Hold on.
[224:50.25]I have so many of these items, but there's nothing to use them on.
[224:52.25]This room, like, didn't spawn enemies.
[225:01.55]I don't know.
[225:03.76]Um, I got an auto shotgun in here, and then it was like, okay, now come up here.
[225:07.81]Now there's nowhere else for me to go.
[225:10.79]Do I climb this?
[225:14.65]I would think up there, but can I get up there?
[225:16.83]Um...
[225:25.54]This guy's got a few screws loose.
[225:27.04]Yeah, I know.
[225:28.26]Read the lore.
[225:29.04]Read the fucking lore.

[240:04.02]Oh, this is the plane.
[240:04.66]This is the plane crash, alright.
[240:10.41]This kind of looks like Resident Evil.
[240:12.25]This is Resident Evil vibes.
[240:20.60]Oh, come on.
[240:26.25]Stop focusing on me.
[240:27.27]There's a monster behind you.
[240:36.08]Fuck off.
[240:36.56]Alright, he's dead.
[240:39.76]It's a clock tower?
[240:47.89]Who is shooting at me?
[240:58.46]I'll just... I'll shoot all of you.
[240:59.74]Whatever.
[241:05.66]Now where?
[241:08.63]Oh, I jumped... I jumped over it.
[241:11.03]That works.
[241:13.97]No!
[241:18.81]They're so much more rare in this game.
[241:20.53]Have you noticed that?
[241:22.15]They're rare.
[241:24.25]You don't get them that often.
[241:36.18]Jesus.
[241:59.68]Who's got a grenade?
[242:02.88]You.
[242:03.32]Okay, drop it.
[242:06.69]He still got it off.
[242:09.33]Dedication.
[242:16.88]Oh, nice.
[242:28.59]It's all over me.
[242:29.69]Water?
[242:48.13]Like they're gonna shock me Town NPC being killed
[243:16.64]Alright.
[243:17.22]I got it.
[243:17.86]What the hell is this?
[243:18.94]Wait, it's a missile launcher.
[243:20.18]Holy shit.
[243:20.72]Nice.
[243:21.96]Finally.
[243:24.18]Oh, he's doing it too.
[243:27.97]Oh, I feel like I just saw my future.
[243:46.91]Whoa!
[243:50.35]New weapon, new weapon, new weapon.
[243:57.11]Shoot him with the... Shoot him.
[244:00.27]You need a new... Hold on.
[244:01.33]Wait, wait.
[244:02.07]Hold on.
[244:02.35]Wait.
[244:02.53]Forget about the link for a second.
[244:05.60]I need new missiles.
[244:08.22]It's a great deal.
[244:11.84]Alright.
[244:12.96]What is it?
[244:14.36]Debt wiping deal.
[244:15.34]If Jerma makes Otto's Big Adventure 3, uploads it to his main channel, and uses this thumbnail, the entire debt is wiped.
[244:22.78]Bringing an explosive end to arguably the best joke of the year.
[244:27.03]I'll think about it.
[244:45.47]I'll think about it.
[244:45.95]If you have my attention, I'll think about it.
[244:52.57]Okay.
[244:55.36]We'll see.
[244:55.66]Give me that!
[245:16.52]Get out of here.
[245:17.06]That's it?
[245:18.30]One more?
[245:18.62]He's still alive?
[245:31.08]Don't you dare wipe that debt without a dump truck emote.
[245:36.29]Hey.
[245:37.53]I'm just going by what you guys are saying.
[245:39.11]Nothing else.
[245:43.93]Got him.
[245:54.22]Jerma lied about the court stream.
[245:55.91]Well, Jerma didn't lie about the court stream.
[245:57.83]Jerma got denied at a bunch of courts to film a fucking comedy trial.
[246:03.43]Alright, now where do we go?
[246:19.60]Stop the deal.
[246:20.48]Stop the deal.
[246:28.88]Did you say where'd I go?
[246:29.74]I just ducked.
[246:30.90]Alright, flamethrower sucks.
[246:36.90]Let's be honest.
[246:53.07]Oh, snipers.
[246:56.51]I gotta go save her.
[246:57.25]Snipers!
[247:08.10]No dump, no deal.
[247:14.07]A main channel upload is big.
[247:15.39]It is.
[247:15.73]The main channel upload is pretty huge.
[247:20.17]Reach the new rally point.
[247:29.10]Why'd you run towards it?
[247:30.04]What are you doing?
[247:41.53]No dump, no deal.
[247:42.81]No dump, no deal.
[248:08.01]No dump, no deal.
[248:09.05]No dump, no deal.
[248:10.31]Just wait.
[248:11.61]That's not up to you.
[248:12.76]That's up to the majority.
[248:18.52]Wait.
[248:20.16]That was a sniper.
[248:30.61]Sniper duel.
[248:41.88]I cheated.
[248:43.60]Where is she?
[248:47.37]Where is she?
[248:53.81]Where are you?
[248:55.45]You.
[248:56.33]Where are you?
[248:56.99]Sniper!
[249:13.89]Nice ping.
[249:14.51]Yeah, pretty good.
[249:15.11]I don't see anybody else.
[249:28.66]Where?
[249:28.90]I feel like I'm missing something.
[249:33.60]What am I missing here?
[250:02.32]No dump.
[250:06.54]I'm pretty good with a sniper.
[250:07.40]You guys have seen my videos.
[250:09.53]I'm pretty good.
[250:11.73]Not the best.
[250:12.85]Not even great.
[250:14.63]But good.
[250:18.17]Come on.
[250:25.89]I sure can.
[250:28.06]Here we go.
[250:31.82]I think I just hurt myself.
[250:37.21]Destroyed it.
[250:38.79]This game sucks.
[250:39.57]Oh, his perfect score is gone.
[251:10.99]Maybe it's you that sucks.
[251:14.51]That's true.
[251:16.29]You could be right.
[251:17.61]Could be me.
[251:22.29]Doubt it.
[251:31.41]Big music.
[251:32.59]For... I'm not sure yet.
[251:50.74]Where's the other guy?
[251:55.01]New deal.
[251:55.51]Hold on.
[251:55.87]Stop.
[251:56.73]Stop.
[251:56.91]Stop.
[251:57.27]Stop.
[251:57.55]Stop.
[251:57.81]Stop.
[251:58.91]Stop.
[252:02.78]Should go to Brazil.
[252:03.52]Alright.
[252:08.15]What?
[252:08.29]That didn't hit?
[252:37.63]Doesn't even matter what weapon.
[252:45.51]Look at this.
[252:49.50]Dude is fucking on fire.
[252:55.26]Just electro shoot that guy.
[252:56.20]Yeah.
[253:00.96]Can I drive the car?
[253:06.67]No.
[253:12.34]Come to Brazil.
[253:12.92]I don't know.
[253:13.62]Whatever.
[253:13.96]Maybe.
[253:18.88]Wait, what did it say?
[253:21.20]Oh.
[253:21.32]I don't know.
[253:24.04]I don't have any plans to go to Brazil.
[253:25.46]But if I was ever there, I'm sure I'd be like, alright, cool.
[253:27.65]I'm in Brazil.
[253:30.37]Should I go up?
[253:37.81]He just promised.
[253:48.40]We have another good deal in chat.
[253:49.77]Are you sure?
[253:50.53]Please come visit me.
[254:12.23]I have a good store and a good view.
[254:16.82]What do you mean a good store and a good view?
[254:18.46]I don't know what you mean.
[254:30.73]Oh, fuck.
[254:31.19]Don't let him get in.
[254:32.32]Wait.
[254:32.54]Am I going to get in that?
[254:34.56]I'm going to get in this.
[254:35.22]Okay.
[254:36.92]Does this count as a letter grade?
[254:39.94]I think this counts.
[254:47.57]Fire missiles.
[254:58.89]Return of the DMT robot.
[255:03.55]No, I don't... This is not... No.
[255:05.49]This is just like an artist's rendition of the DMT robot.
[255:09.36]Not the same thing.
[255:10.90]It's just... No, it's not him.
[255:22.80]Am I stepping on people?
[255:32.50]What was that?
[255:32.84]That was like the slime sound from Nickelodeon.
[255:47.09]Where do I go?
[255:53.94]Dude, I can't see shit right now.
[255:55.68]I think I'm going this way.
[256:03.36]Press V. Whoa.
[256:09.53]No.
[256:09.75]I don't like that.
[256:18.71]I'm not doing that again.
[256:33.05]Yeah, this is not as cool as DMT robot.
[256:48.26]Why is it so grainy?
[256:49.56]I can't tell if I'm supposed to go.
[256:56.40]Yeah, no, I understand the ResidentSleepers.
[256:58.00]I get it.
[256:58.46]So I get it.
[256:59.54]I understand them.
[257:06.84]Give me dump or give me death.
[257:17.88]That guy right now is like, he got out of the armor.
[257:19.72]Oh my God, this is my chance.
[257:20.96]Is he going to get in the armor?
[257:25.30]Actually stole it.
[257:26.00]That would be so funny.
[257:27.67]This game would get a full letter grade if he stole that.
[257:37.02]Don't do that.
[257:37.44]Alright, now we're going to open the door.
[257:48.51]Do a PS2 tech demo.
[257:55.93]I actually have a 3DO disk.
[257:57.65]I have one of the 3DO demo discs, I think.
[258:00.82]I'm still going to play more 3DO.
[258:03.48]There's still a shitload of stuff to do.
[258:10.53]Missile launcher.
[258:12.09]This thing.
[258:12.89]Lore.
[258:16.17]How do I get the door open?
[258:22.52]3DO?
[258:22.70]Yeah.
[258:22.96]We'll go back to the 3DO at some point soon.
[258:32.77]Get back in?
[258:35.59]Let's go.
[258:36.03]Get back in.
[258:38.10]Like Gex.
[258:38.64]I played Gex already and I didn't.
[258:40.59]I was fun.
[258:41.89]It was fun.
[258:55.02]I can't wait to eat a pizza.
[258:56.82]I'm going to get a large pizza from somewhere.
[259:00.20]I don't know where.
[259:10.10]Oh shit, we're gonna do a fight here.
[259:11.77]Did I get him?
[259:19.03]Warning, warning, warning, warning.
[259:26.36]Seriously, I feel like I'm playing this through somebody else's stream.
[259:40.54]On like the lowest quality settings.
[259:46.90]Alright.
[259:47.20]Alright.
[259:47.50]Alright.
[259:47.82]Okay.
[259:48.26]Alright.
[259:48.54]Get out.
[259:49.03]I... I'm watching this on an old TV.
[259:55.33]I can't even... What the fuck is happening?
[259:59.51]It's movie night in the fucking 80s.
[260:01.27]Hey, just... Just wiggle it around a little.
[260:06.04]See if we can get the fucking pay-per-view channels.
[260:08.38]Robocop's on tonight.
[260:11.87]I can't handle this much more.
[260:12.89]I gotta get out of this thing.
[260:13.69]Get me out.
[260:14.13]Get me out of this thing right now.
[260:18.88]Eject.
[260:19.24]Eject.
[260:19.48]Eject.
[260:19.84]Eject.
[260:20.22]Eject.
[260:22.02]How do I eject?
[260:24.66]I'm sorry.
[260:25.24]I'm turning it off.
[260:36.87]What the fuck was that?
[260:47.39]Oh, what do I do?
[260:48.93]Oh, what do I do?
[260:49.97]Oh, it's a locked door.
[260:51.63]Okay, thank God.
[261:06.81]Griffin, report.
[261:08.23]It's me, Peter Griffin reporting in.
[261:11.75]There's a crazy lady trying to attack me.
[261:24.68]Wouldn't that be recoil?
[261:29.58]Yuck!
[261:37.67]Can I move this?
[261:43.31]No.
[261:47.51]I'm stuck here.
[261:48.23]I wanted to help that guy.
[262:02.90]Oh, there's Stokes.
[262:04.63]Alright, let's go.
[262:05.31]Back up.
[262:09.09]I'm sorry.
[262:12.63]Sorry, I held a grenade down.
[262:15.89]I was trying to cook it in time to throw at the lady.
[262:18.27]It's my bad.
[262:32.18]Griffin dead.
[262:32.84]Is that it?
[262:37.74]It sounds like- It sounds like- What's his name?
[262:47.25]Oh my god.
[262:55.83]The guy from Sausage Party.
[262:57.17]What's his name?
[262:57.85]He's a famous actor.
[262:58.99]What's the guy's name?
[263:03.23]What's his name?
[263:03.91]Seth Rogen.
[263:04.65]Yes.
[263:04.93]She sounds like Seth Rogen.
[263:16.66]The guy from Sausage Party.
[263:17.86]Really?
[263:18.26]I don't know.
[263:18.70]I can't remember anything.
[263:24.09]We're gonna be fine.
[263:24.99]You and me.
[263:26.15]Don't worry.
[263:26.75]I'm the grenade guy.
[263:28.51]How many grenades do you have?
[263:30.25]How many grenades have you thrown?
[263:32.23]Yeah.
[263:33.39]I'm the wild one.
[263:34.39]Why are you walking towards this?
[263:39.99]You might be a good shot, but I blow shit up.

[263:50.73]Should I pick it up?
[263:52.60]Alright, you're unkillable.

[266:35.21]Follow me over here.
[266:35.91]We definitely could maybe get in through here.
[266:40.23]Can we get through this lock?
[266:42.39]I can't shoot the lock.
[266:43.97]Let's try through this way.
[266:51.12]Is there a window we can climb in?
[266:53.22]Let's check and see.
[266:55.58]I don't think there is.
[266:57.58]Stokes, can we just drive that through the front door?
[267:02.30]I don't understand why we can't.
[267:02.96]We have a tank.
[267:04.38]Just shoot a missile into it.
[267:10.07]You definitely go this way.
[267:11.39]Can you give me ten fingers so I can jump up?
[267:15.79]It's definitely over there.
[267:26.95]What the hell?
[267:31.79]What's 10 fingers?
[267:35.21]And you lift the person's shoe up!

[268:19.75]Watch out.
[268:20.07]You good?
[268:24.47]Careful.
[268:24.75]Watch out for the glass.

[268:29.69]Ladybugs.
[268:30.89]Maybe...
[268:33.27]Yeah, I never did quite well in school.
[268:36.22]I did pretty bad in like math and stuff.
[268:39.54]How about you?
[268:39.92]Did you do good in school?
[268:46.66]Well, we're in the same room, so it's okay.
[268:55.39]There's a ghost in here.
[269:06.60]Does she actually fight?
[269:07.30]Remember, you're firing that weapon... No.
[269:12.56]This is... This is like monsters.
[269:26.05]I'll let you do the honors.
[269:27.17]Hit this.
[269:30.98]Punch it.
[269:32.04]Like this.
[269:35.27]Remember, you're firing that weapon.
[269:36.29]I know I'm firing the weapon.
[269:37.41]I know I'm holding it.
[269:46.19]Find something?
[269:50.18]Damn it!
[269:50.58]I missed it!
[269:51.06]That was such an opportunity and I just blew it so bad.
[270:12.63]Ow.
[270:13.81]My fucking ears.
[270:14.83]Did I get lost?
[270:36.44]Oh, come on.
[270:38.66]I got lost.
[270:42.35]I do.
[270:43.53]I'm coming back.
[270:45.92]I'll find you.
[270:46.76]I can just keep talking.
[270:48.26]I'll be able to find you.
[270:50.34]Okay.
[271:31.88]Sing us a song.
[271:33.52]Okay.
[271:34.54]No, no more singing.
[271:35.48]No more singing.
[271:36.12]I'm too hungry to sing.
[271:38.14]I'm too hungry to make any singing songs.
[271:41.42]But if I can play the tambourine, I will.
[271:44.19]Game is a zero.
[271:57.98]He's got the munchies so bad, bro.
[272:02.63]I mean, yeah, but nothing to do with smoking any marijuana.

[272:43.04]Yeah, the last game really carried itself with being able to laugh at the guy saying, oh shit, every time it slowed down.
[272:56.01]We, we, we like looked over a fear.
[272:58.27]Well, fear one was actually pretty good though.
[273:02.91]Oh, okay.
[273:03.79]Right.
[273:09.20]I genuinely thought fear one was pretty good game.
[273:11.04]There's nothing wrong with this one.
[273:19.43]This, the games, this game's not bad.

[273:34.71]It's just kind of a game.
[273:37.68]I get hit by a chair?

[276:45.61]I don't know.
[276:46.25]It kind of just... I don't know.
[276:47.89]That fear one's way better.
[276:48.74]There's others to it.
[276:53.16]There's really others to it?
[276:54.54]Nothing much to it?
[277:06.13]Did you already forget you got separated?
[277:08.01]Yeah, but I'm trying to... When are we going to see her?
[277:17.18]I don't think most people... What's wrong?

[278:26.49]I mean, those are big, so I'll be okay, I think.
[278:39.18]Okay, I got a question about the Fear franchise.
[278:41.64]So Fear 1 was made, and then they, like, didn't they outsource Fear 2 and Fear 3?
[278:50.91]What was the point of having... What was the point of that?
[278:54.87]How would you outsource the next two games in the franchise you made?
[279:16.82]I think I like this studio though.
[279:18.08]I think this is a really good studio.
[279:19.52]This is the um...

[297:12.22]Who did that?
[297:12.58]I feel like I shouldn't walk up here.

[308:15.14]If Jerma makes Otto's Big Adventure 3, uploads it to his main channel and uses that thumbnail, the debt will be wiped, bringing an explosive end to the best joke of the year.
[308:25.80]But hold on, but there's an extra term added.
[308:29.11]Jerma must add either Jerma Suss or Jerma Dump Truck.
[308:34.57]I would rather have it be Jerma dump truck, but naked, than add Jerma sauce.
[308:51.52]But that's not part of this deal.
[308:54.18]That's not part of the deal.
[308:55.14]That's just how I, that's what I said.
[308:56.94]That's not, that's not part of the deal though.
[309:00.11]I need to get like a brush.

[309:08.31]Deal, deal, deal.

[310:16.37]Okay, man, we're gonna do this three, two, one.
[310:20.23]I opened the door.
[310:21.29]Sound off, dammit.
[310:25.78]What the fuck's going on out there?
[310:27.16]Turn on.
[310:27.60]If you're an enemy, just you ask.
[310:30.14]But, man, we need reinforcements now.
[310:42.76]Voltage.
[310:44.50]Alright, back to admin.
[310:47.01]Nobody say it.
[310:47.87]I know.
[310:48.35]We're going back to admin.
[310:52.63]Somebody's always at admin the whole time, man.
[311:13.13]Alright, this is where I have to go back to Admin?
[311:17.27]Am I finally going to get to kill this guy?
[311:21.31]Am I finally going to get to murder this dude?
[311:25.10]That door is locked.
[311:26.20]What about this one?
[311:27.40]Locked.
[311:28.48]All these doors are locked.
[311:29.22]Alright, so where do I go?
[311:30.06]Dude, you know what I'm going to do tonight?
[311:33.21]Oh shit, listen to this.
[311:34.53]I'm going to do a face scrub tonight.
[311:37.17]That sounds pretty sick, doesn't it?
[311:46.68]Who said no?
[311:52.76]Do it now.
[311:54.56]I might.
[312:01.11]You know what?
[312:01.47]You know why I don't like this game?
[312:02.47]Because this game has like this weird one hidden door you have to go into.
[312:10.89]I don't like it.
[312:22.18]They tried to make this a horror game.
[312:23.90]And it's not, I mean, it's not even scary.
[312:29.21]Why did they make it like this?
[312:30.27]Why'd they do this?
[312:34.23]I'm not scared of whatever's down here.
[312:35.41]Are you serious?
[312:59.10]This is not hard.
[313:05.97]Can I turn the lights back on?
[313:12.64]So brave.
[313:13.50]So strong.
[313:18.40]I don't claim to be strong or brave.
[313:22.37]I claim to be right.
[313:26.91]What's the lady's name from... Here's a story of a man named Brady, and he had his three children of his own.
[313:32.57]What's the lady's name in that?
[313:43.96]Mrs. Brunch.
[313:47.32]Right.
[313:49.68]That's not Mrs. Brunch?
[313:51.31]What?
[313:54.22]Bunch.
[313:54.58]Brady Bunch.
[313:55.32]Not Mrs. Brunch.
[313:57.74]That's a pretty sick name.
[314:03.48]Here's the story of Mrs. Brunch.
[314:09.54]Clean your face up.
[314:10.28]I'm going to.
[314:13.14]I did this and I'm going to leave it like that because I don't even care.
[314:15.32]I don't even care, dude.
[314:17.47]I don't care if my hair looks stupid.
[314:19.13]Who cares?
[314:19.63]Haha.
[314:22.78]Now I know why I got Tommy Wiseau.
[314:25.64]It's becoming pretty clear now.
[314:30.24]How do I leave?
[314:40.59]Can I get out of here?
[314:43.97]Get out!
[314:54.18]Just get away from me.
[314:55.32]Get away from me.
[314:56.22]Get away from me.
[314:57.10]Get away from me.
[314:57.78]Get away from me.
[315:05.84]And what?
[315:07.12]In the morning, my face is... Oh, that's American Psycho.
[315:20.31]I can't even see, I can't even tell what way is the right way to go.
[315:24.05]Everything just looks very similar and like it's flashing.
[315:29.00]Is one of the Charlie Brown adults talking?
[315:57.42]What the hell is going on?
[316:45.01]Alright.
[316:48.19]I've almost had enough.
[316:58.67]I'm so close to the end of the game too.
[317:00.57]What am I hitting?
[317:08.52]End of the stream.
[317:09.36]I'm so close to the end though.
[317:11.02]I know I'm like an hour away.
[317:22.08]Finish it.
[317:23.26]Hold on.
[317:23.92]What the fuck happened to that guy?
[317:28.48]Alright, no more saying the F word.
[317:35.02]If I say fuck one more time, then I will give
[317:40.00]myself a face scrub.
[317:42.02]Stop throwing guns on the ground.
[317:44.60]Alright, I keep asking this and I just don't look at the chat.
[318:00.31]How many chapters are in this game?
[318:02.47]What's like the actual chapter count?
[318:03.76]That's made it so much worse.
[318:27.08]Bye.
[318:28.40]Seven chapters.
[318:29.18]What are we on now?
[318:32.20]Five or six?
[318:32.74]I think that was the general.
[318:42.36]Oh, I need a security key.
[318:45.77]Stupid.
[319:01.89]Siri, unlock.
[319:07.63]How many phones did I just unlock?
[319:13.55]Imagine if that worked.
[319:16.33]Siri, unlock.
[319:17.92]Unlocking phone.
[319:21.54]Good thing that's not a good, that's not a feature.
[319:36.42]Stop, dude.
[319:36.88]My phone's going nuts.
[319:46.53]Do a coin flip.
[319:47.27]I'm bored.
[319:47.77]Okay.
[319:51.09]Mods?
[319:52.35]Can we get a coin flip prediction in chat, please?
[319:58.84]That would be pretty cool.
[320:00.80]Here we go.
[320:01.36]I would put big money on this one.
[320:18.30]We got... It's gonna be heads.
[320:27.43]I'm on mobile.
[320:29.03]Oh.
[320:30.23]Um... Hold on, can I do it?
[320:32.55]How do I do it?
[320:35.53]Prediction.
[320:35.95]Hold on.
[320:37.25]I think I can do it.
[320:38.92]What do we want?
[320:40.18]Oh, I want to do a coin flip.
[320:45.10]I don't have the power to do it.
[320:46.30]Well, how was it happening before?
[320:50.22]I wasn't doing it before.
[320:57.89]Here it comes.
[320:58.67]Let's go.
[321:05.71]Make this a big one.
[321:07.16]I want 5 million.
[321:08.48]5 million on each side.
[321:13.38]If it were me.
[321:13.90]I would say it's probably going to be.
[321:17.12]I'm going to bet on heads.
[321:19.12]I would say heads.
[321:21.10]That's me.
[321:22.23]But who are you?
[321:22.77]3.3 million versus... You guys are going to lose all these points.
[321:42.12]This is millions.
[321:44.60]Okay, let's see it.
[321:45.64]6.5 to 6.
[321:46.62]It's pretty even.
[321:52.97]Yeah, but someone's going to win all those points.
[321:55.23]Oh shit, they are.
[321:56.01]Okay, I need a key or something, right?
[322:03.86]Well, we got time.
[322:05.06]We'll check it in a minute.
[322:05.74]Let me wander around aimlessly to find the one item I need to progress through this game.
[322:11.98]Information, it was like a key or in the registrar's office or something, right?
[322:17.73]I thought that was a grenade.
[322:28.22]Where is this key?
[322:31.78]Nurse's office, right?
[322:32.70]I don't know.
[322:36.62]I have no idea.
[322:37.36]I don't have a single goddamn clue.
[322:41.35]Where's my... Is it the principal's office?
[322:52.69]Teacher's lounge.
[322:56.62]Just flip it already.
[322:57.72]You will.
[322:59.26]Come on.
[323:03.25]Here it comes.
[323:05.95]Congratulations to... Don't yawn!
[323:17.15]Don't yawn on stream.
[323:18.31]That means that you're tired and the game's boring.
[323:25.28]What was it?
[323:30.07]It was... Congratulations to... Me, because I stole them all.
[323:56.70]Dude, this guy in here is not vibing with me, okay?
[324:14.72]What was it?
[324:15.22]I don't know.
[324:16.03]What was the outcome?
[324:22.81]I'm done with this game.
[324:25.29]I'm done playing it.
[324:25.75]What was the outcome?
[324:33.06]I have to flip a coin.
[324:36.62]Oh, okay.
[324:38.41]I have to do it.
[324:45.52]I don't have a coin.
[324:46.16]Do I have something I can flip?
[324:52.16]How about this?
[324:52.56]Okay.
[324:56.03]I have a heel cap.
[324:59.23]If it's up, it's tails.
[325:00.99]If it's down, it's heads.
[325:02.19]Okay.
[325:04.93]Do it on Google.
[325:05.69]No, I don't care.
[325:07.37]No, don't.
[325:08.25]No, do it on Google.
[325:09.19]What the?
[325:09.69]Okay.
[325:10.87]Alright, alright.
[325:11.51]Hold on.
[325:11.90]I'll do it.
[325:13.84]Ugh.
[325:16.16]Okay.
[325:17.22]Are we ready?
[325:19.16]Coin flip.
[325:23.92]Flipping the coin.
[325:25.54]The coin is... Tails.

[330:11.20]Imagine you won like blackjack.

[330:14.96]The dealer wasn't looking.
[330:15.96]That one doesn't count.
[330:17.22]And then you did it again and you lost.
[330:18.41]That one doesn't count either.

[331:04.58]Don't do it yet!
[331:05.46]Hold on.
[331:05.90]Don't do it yet.
[331:06.48]They haven't even predicted.
[331:07.90]Nobody's even bet any money.
[331:33.33]I haven't, um, you see my hand.
[331:35.93]That was it.
[331:36.68]It's going down.
[331:37.52]I have it in the exact spot I wanted it.
[331:39.78]It's going down like that.
[331:41.56]It's in the perfect spot in my hand.
[331:44.68]You saw, I flipped it.
[331:46.07]Ding!
[331:46.75]And I'm about to slap it down.
[331:47.71]This is the exact spot that it's supposed to be in.
[331:51.81]Play dramatic music.
[332:03.44]I'm gonna get in trouble for this.
[332:09.62]It's starting to get really, really sweaty and wet in my hand.
[332:22.75]Not a good feeling.
[332:23.35]I really want to let this go.
[332:31.40]I really want to let this out of my hand right now.
[332:40.37]You guys ready?
[332:40.83]I'm not taking it out of frame.
[332:53.77]Okay, what does everybody think?
[332:55.48]It's a 12 million to 11.2 million.
[332:57.16]For a coin toss.
[333:11.41]Gets her off.
