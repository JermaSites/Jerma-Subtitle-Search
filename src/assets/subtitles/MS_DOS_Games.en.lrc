[00:01.57]Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters.
[00:06.43]Hey guys.
[00:07.59]Welcome back.
[00:09.83]To another edition of Digital Monsters.
[00:13.74]I'm your guide.
[00:18.96]The emote is here.
[00:20.12]Yep.
[00:21.66]I've been hanging out in chat for like an hour or so.
[00:24.77]Popping in and out.
[00:27.07]Just popping my head in here.
[00:31.72]I was going to hold off and have a few more come out next week.
[00:36.83]But I decided, you know, whatever.
[00:42.27]Just put it out.
[00:46.29]I think it looks pretty good.
[00:55.74]So today, we're doing a
[01:02.23]Extra stream.
[01:03.59]No, it's not even really extra.
[01:05.31]Just another one in a row.
[01:08.87]Only had a small... You know, three to four hour, three and a half hour stream on... What was it now?
[01:16.77]A couple days ago.
[01:18.81]So, I figured, let's complete it.
[01:21.39]And let's put, you know... Another three, four, five, six, however long.
[01:26.70]Just chill out with the MS-DOS... Video game archive.
[01:33.18]There are 4,334 MS-DOS games on this website.
[01:43.03]First of all.
[01:44.13]Second of all, it is you who will pick the games I will play.
[01:50.55]Let's just make sure it works.
[01:52.75]For the purpose of the stream, go ahead and start clicking on the screen.
[01:58.82]I want to make sure it still works.
[02:01.68]And it does, doesn't it?
[02:06.48]This is gonna be a smart click stream.
[02:13.31]Now, is there a way?
[02:16.33]Alright, so, do me a favor.
[02:18.93]Get, like, all four corners.
[02:21.03]You know, go, like, top left, top right, as far as you can go.
[02:25.71]Give me some corners here.
[02:27.83]Alright, so top right and top left work fine.
[02:32.66]But it's just that bottom area.
[02:34.60]I wonder why that is.
[02:37.94]There's nothing really I can change about it, either.
[02:41.15]Should be okay, though.
[02:45.63]Get out your laptops, lovely users.
[02:47.93]Yeah, this should just be fun.
[02:48.83]Just wanted to... wanted to do it.
[02:52.58]Now, Sam and Max will return.
[02:57.78]Um... This coming week, here.
[03:01.12]Let me take a look at my calendar.
[03:06.95]It's like that because of the Twitch UI for full screening.
[03:09.47]I see.
[03:13.29]I still remember you calling me an asshole yesterday.
[03:16.88]No, I was just fucking around.
[03:19.38]I was a little hangry last night.
[03:21.00]I'm sorry.
[03:21.56]I was hungry and annoyed.
[03:25.46]I was hangry.
[03:27.44]I was.
[03:29.11]Only at the very, very end, though.
[03:30.53]I don't know.
[03:30.79]It just kind of clicked in there.
[03:39.14]What happened?
[03:39.62]Nothing happened.
[03:40.18]I was just being... I was just irritated because... I don't know.
[03:46.80]I'm just a human, alright?
[03:48.54]Sometimes you get irritated.
[03:52.00]Maybe you should eat some food, asshole.
[03:53.52]See, somebody called me an asshole.
[03:55.32]What am I supposed to do?
[03:57.97]No, I'm just kidding.
[04:07.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:11.39]Smart clicks work?
[04:14.77]To be fair, chat can be... No, all I did, I was responding.
[04:20.69]Somebody said that this stream today was gonna be a shitty idea.
[04:24.21]And I said, hey.
[04:26.34]Hey.
[04:28.62]That's it.
[04:29.32]I didn't say anything else.
[04:32.90]That was it.
[04:33.32]That was it.
[04:35.94]It's a new day, though.
[04:37.64]You know, if you give up a home run, you don't think about that home run every single time you play.
[04:49.15]You know, you gotta get struck out sometimes.
[04:52.47]Well, the pitcher doesn't get struck out unless you're playing in the National League.
[04:56.73]Think about that home run.
[04:59.27]But, alright, let's get going.
[05:04.68]Just be funny.
[05:06.00]No, that's not forehead.
[05:07.28]No, it's not.
[05:07.98]Do not, no.
[05:08.66]Geropop is not intended to be used as a forehead.
[05:11.06]It's intended to be used as an ice cream to eat and enjoy.
[05:13.52]Oh, great.
[05:20.44]So, here is how this is going to work.
[05:21.90]Let me turn off this for a second here.
[05:23.18]Let me get it in a minute.
[05:25.89]Okay.
[05:26.63]So, let me make sure this is on correctly.
[05:28.83]It should be.
[05:30.27]And as you see here, would you look at that.
[05:35.82]here are some of the thousands of video games that are on here so very important first little tidbit of information here is the reason why it looks like this is because this area here is if you want me to scroll
[06:03.41]This is the archiv- all- all- from my understanding, and this was a recommendation, by the way.
[06:08.11]From my understanding, all this stuff is, like, abandoned vaporware on, like, the Archive website.
[06:15.94]I- I- it's on, like, archive.org.
[06:20.06]I think this is- this is all, like, kind of shit that doesn't, like, doesn't exist anymore.
[06:27.81]How about this?
[06:28.37]Anything that's still copywritten, I won't play.
[06:31.58]So, here's your criteria.
[06:34.74]Everyone gets to pick.
[06:35.58]You guys get to pick what I do today.
[06:38.78]No copyright stuff.
[06:40.56]No porn games.
[06:42.24]No games that are rated R. No games that require anything to do with a mouse.
[06:46.35]And no games that have loud sounds.
[06:48.97]So, you've got to pick wisely here, because I don't want to get in trouble.
[06:55.74]So out of this 4,334, you probably have a choice of between like maybe 40 different games.
[07:07.00]But the reason why this is down here is because I'm going to just start at the top here.
[07:12.50]And by the way, I get full veto.
[07:13.95]So if you're going to want me to play like SimCity illegally...
[07:17.85]I'm gonna have to veto that one.
[07:19.73]I'm just gonna have to do that.
[07:21.21]Uh, if you want me to play, for instance, Stunts, I'm gonna have to veto that one, too.
[07:25.78]This is copyrighted.
[07:30.16]It's ill- I'm just kidding!
[07:31.76]It's not illegal.
[07:32.62]It's very illegal.
[07:34.66]I don't wanna be, like, on an illegal stream.
[07:37.76]Any Twitch staff in here?
[07:43.17]Any Twitch staff in here that tell me this is, like, illegal?
[07:48.01]This is all public to archive.org.
[07:52.91]Like Aladdin.
[07:55.05]Who cares?
[07:55.48]Oh, well, the new movie's coming out, right?
[07:58.88]It's a game library.
[07:59.86]Yeah, it's an archive.org public game library.
[08:04.98]Well, let's put it this way.
[08:05.86]If like Twitch staff comes in here and says, get out of here.
[08:08.94]I'll be like, all right, man.
[08:13.43]And then we'll pack it up and go to a different streaming website for like an hour.
[08:17.99]I'm kidding.
[08:18.39]That's a joke.
[08:20.35]Don't, nobody hold that on me.
[08:24.01]All right.
[08:24.29]So remember if you, let's get started.
[08:26.99]If you want me to scroll, it's an infinite scroll, by the way.
[08:33.45]This is already off limits.
[08:34.97]I'm not going to play a porn game.
[08:37.59]So don't click that one.
[08:40.16]Here we go.
[08:42.01]Please click on the thing.
[08:44.55]If you want me to scroll down, and by the way, a scroll down means all of it.
[08:50.46]I'm scrolling down here.
[08:53.96]So if you want that scroll, you better know that's what you want.
[08:58.92]You know how this is going to end.
[09:02.84]Not yet, I don't.
[09:04.68]Please click the screen on the thing you'd like me to play.
[09:10.36]Already vetoed the porn game.
[09:19.80]It's not porn.
[09:21.44]It's a porn game.
[09:23.18]This game starts off at porn.
[09:26.08]It's a porn start.
[09:28.74]It's a porn start.
[09:32.31]It really isn't?
[09:32.91]I don't know.
[09:33.23]It could be a porn game.
[09:35.55]Can you guys not click over here?
[09:39.47]You should be able to click on the right side.
[09:45.67]No, you can't.
[09:47.91]Look at that!
[09:50.21]I'm getting baited.
[09:53.56]Yeah, see, if you want me to scroll, you click over there.
[09:57.40]Make sure you click on the same spot, because I have to do addition.
[10:03.02]Alright, so now that we know the rules, now that you know the rules, we're going to do... Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
[10:11.77]Add an arrow icon?
[10:13.59]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[10:15.77]When people just think of good ideas, I love it.
[10:18.99]So let's add a down arrow that you have to click on.
[10:25.81]I'm just going to put a circle or something.
[10:28.78]Look, I'll just put the popsicle up there.
[10:33.80]Put a down vote.
[10:34.82]No, no, no.
[10:36.52]Alright, if you want to scroll, click on the pop.
[10:38.58]The new emote.
[10:50.60]This is where you need to click if you want to scroll down.
[10:56.98]Alright.
[10:59.08]Here we go.
[11:01.33]And play elevator music.
[11:02.59]That's too much for me.
[11:10.71]How are new viewers going to know that?
[11:14.01]You know what?
[11:14.53]They won't.
[11:15.07]You're right.
[11:16.78]I'm so lost.
[11:18.24]Wait.
[11:19.57]Why is it covering up the... Hold on a second.
[11:22.09]There we go.
[11:22.59]Okay.
[11:23.19]You want me to scroll?
[11:26.78]No, everybody just clicked it because I put the face up there.
[11:30.32]You don't actually want me to scroll.
[11:35.48]It's just like bugs to a light.
[11:39.26]It's like, oh shit, click!
[11:40.84]A face!
[11:50.18]Only click once.
[11:54.06]We want ice cream.
[11:57.42]Ah, shit.
[11:57.96]At least the bug lights work.
[12:07.41]Well, looks like we're going to do the Oregon Trail.
[12:09.41]And I kind of knew that was going to be what we were going to do at first.
[12:13.45]So, I figured that's what we were going to do.
[12:17.14]Oregon Trail it is.
[12:20.73]So, here we go.
[12:23.42]Let's do the Oregon Trail.
[12:27.60]It might be loud, and I apologize in advance if it is.
[12:31.06]Here we go.
[12:38.40]Don't worry, I've got it set up, so I can do this.
[12:41.48]Hey, oh shit, I gotta get that image off the screen.
[12:46.30]Oh fuck, I can't get him off the screen.
[12:49.72]All right, here we go.
[12:52.38]Copyright 1990.
[12:53.48]I'm fucked.
[12:57.78]I have to keep them there for the first month.
[12:59.88]You may travel the trail, learn about the trail, see the Oregon top 10, turn sound off, choose management option.
[13:04.58]What is N?
[13:05.08]What is your option?
[13:05.75]Choose the trail.
[13:06.73]Travel the trail.
[13:11.75]How many kinds of people made the trip to Oregon?
[13:14.05]You may be a banker from Boston.
[13:17.02]Yeah, I mean, that's the easy one though.
[13:18.92]These are difficulty settings.
[13:21.12]Be a carpenter from Ohio.
[13:23.00]Be a farmer from Illinois.
[13:24.68]Find out the differences between these choices.
[13:26.78]I know that the banker just gets the most money.
[13:28.99]And I gotta be, it says Boston, I have to click it.
[13:32.17]What is the first name of the wagon leader?
[13:39.83]What are the first names of the four other members in your party?
[13:53.03]It's just all the people that are like in this house.
[13:58.15]You got my multiple split personality.
[14:02.09]My roommate, my girlfriend, and my dog.
[14:10.13]Yeah, these are correct.
[14:15.86]You sleep with Jax in the same bed.
[14:21.89]yes it's me all right it is 1848 you're jumping off place for oregon is independence missouri you must decide which month to leave independence uh it's gonna be too hot in july a little too rainy for me in april uh may bugs come out we're going in march
[14:45.54]Before leaving Independence, you should buy equipment and supplies.
[14:48.06]You have 1,600 bits in cash, but you don't have to spend it all now.
[14:55.04]Okay, 1,600 bucks.
[14:57.33]You can buy whatever you need at Matt's General Store.
[15:00.63]Hello, I'm Matt, so you're going to Oregon.
[15:02.81]I can fix you up with what you need, a team of oxen to pull your wagon, clothing for both summer and winter.
[15:09.35]Excellent.
[15:10.63]Plenty of food for the trip, ammunition for your rifles, and spare parts for your wagon.
[15:15.46]Uh, Matt's Dinner Store, okay.
[15:16.92]Oxen.
[15:17.78]Total bill, zero.
[15:18.60]Amount you have, 16.
[15:19.58]Which item would you like to buy?
[15:20.86]Uh, I eat a lot, so let's make sure we get some food here.
[15:27.39]I recommend you take at least 200 pounds of food for each person in your family.
[15:31.61]I see that you have five people in all.
[15:33.46]You'll need flour, sugar, bacon, and coffee.
[15:36.08]My price is 20 cents a pound.
[15:37.66]How many pounds of food do you want?
[15:40.86]Oh, goddammit, this is one of those math problems.
[15:44.58]If Judy eats 400 pounds of bacon and Kim eats 200 pounds of sugar, how many pounds of bacon will it take to make one bag of flour?
[15:55.25]I don't fucking know.
[15:55.97]Let's go with like 5,000 pounds.
[16:01.85]No.
[16:02.19]How many?
[16:02.77]Two, four, six, eight, a thousand?
[16:06.41]I eat a lot.
[16:06.99]I eat like, okay, I eat like six times a day.
[16:11.06]You wonder why I get so hangry.
[16:13.46]My body is just burning calories constantly.
[16:16.50]I can't stop it.
[16:17.92]No matter what I do.
[16:19.47]When I'm lying in bed, my body is just like 400 degrees.
[16:24.07]Kim will just roll over to me and be like, God, you are like a fireball.
[16:29.99]And I'm just like sweating like, what?
[16:32.35]Oh, sorry.
[16:33.73]And I'll turn over and Jex will be on the other side.
[16:36.01]And he'll be like, I don't see the problem.
[16:38.71]I think you're a little cold, actually.
[16:39.94]Because he's like 30,000 degrees hotter than I am.
[16:46.07]So, okay, we need 1,000 pounds.
[16:53.44]But I eat more, so I'm going to get 1,200 pounds.
[16:56.74]Like, I eat for two.
[16:58.53]You know, like a pregnant guy.
[17:02.97]Food, 200.
[17:03.25]Total bill, 240.
[17:03.61]Oxen.
[17:03.75]Oxen.
[17:08.15]There are two oxen in a yoke.
[17:10.65]I recommend at least three yoke.
[17:12.51]I charge $40 a yoke.
[17:13.91]See, it's doing, this is like children's math.
[17:17.71]Okay, I need three, so two, four, six, six oxens.
[17:23.16]How many yoke do you want?
[17:26.48]More, right?
[17:30.68]Anytime you recommend, I want four.
[17:33.14]Four or five, I'm gonna do five.
[17:33.88]Clothing.
[17:36.14]Clothing.
[17:37.90]You'll need warm clothing in the mountains.
[17:39.35]I recommend taking at least two sets of each clothes per person.
[17:44.49]Each set is 10 bucks.
[17:45.77]I don't trust this Matt person.
[17:47.97]Why?
[17:49.43]Because he looks like the old version of the ice cream that is on the screen right now?
[17:58.84]I mean, that's weird, I guess.
[18:02.40]Because he vapes.
[18:05.62]That's a pipe.
[18:15.27]You're getting scammed.
[18:18.13]I'm not getting scammed yet, I haven't signed the check.
[18:20.15]Okay, you need more clothes in the mountains.
[18:23.09]I recommend taking at least two sets of clothes per person.
[18:25.90]So, 10 sets of clothes.
[18:30.36]Let's go with 12 sets of clothes.
[18:32.96]I'm a banker, I got a lot of money.
[18:35.19]Okay, ammunition.
[18:37.75]I'll sail.
[18:38.23]I sail ammunition in boxes of 20 bullets.
[18:39.91]Each box costs 2 bucks.
[18:41.01]How many boxes do you want?
[18:42.23]A lot.
[18:43.05]Because don't you have to, like, shoot squirrels and stuff and bugs?
[18:51.31]I'm gonna say, like, 5 boxes.
[18:55.72]Okay.
[18:57.04]Maybe should I get more than that?
[18:58.48]Hold on.
[18:59.10]That was only 10 bucks.
[19:01.36]I want 10 boxes.
[19:05.46]Okay.
[19:06.08]Spare parts...
[19:07.90]It's a good idea to have a few spare parts for your wagon.
[19:10.12]Here are the prices.
[19:10.96]Wagon wheel, wagon axle, wagon tongue.
[19:14.10]You have a lot more money.
[19:14.91]Yeah, because I need to invest it.
[19:16.65]I don't want to spend every single cent that I own.
[19:20.31]This is all the money that I have.
[19:21.25]I want to invest it into fucking... I don't know.
[19:23.39]I'm going to put like a call option on Tesla.
[19:27.15]To expire.
[19:28.37]Hopefully.
[19:28.79]Hopefully in the money.
[19:30.19]In like two or three weeks.
[19:39.96]I'm an investment ba- I'm playing the part!
[19:41.78]What are you- come on!
[19:43.17]Alright, I want- how many wagon wheels do you want?
[19:45.17]I want twelve.
[19:46.21]No, that's too many.
[19:49.45]Wagon wheel.
[19:50.27]Uh, it's a good idea to have a few spare parts.
[19:52.35]A few.
[19:54.05]Five.
[19:55.95]Your wagon may only carry three wagon wheels.
[20:00.23]Well, that's bullshit.
[20:01.25]I got 500 bucks, I want another wagon.
[20:02.37]Buy another wagon.
[20:06.27]Three.
[20:07.09]Can I do five axles?
[20:07.99]Alright, we're just gonna do the max.
[20:10.07]Three, three, three.
[20:12.88]Total bill, okay, I have like a thousand dollars left.
[20:16.44]Should I buy more animals?
[20:24.74]The wagon has too much stuff, everyone's gonna have to walk.
[20:28.38]Alright, I'm gonna buy some more, I'm gonna buy five more oxen.
[20:33.16]No, no, no, no, no, okay, that's not adding, that's total.
[20:38.25]I'm going to 6 yolks.
[20:43.74]Ammo.
[20:44.62]How many boxes do I want?
[20:47.60]Let's go with like 20 boxes.
[20:50.62]More than that.
[20:52.52]Let's go with 100 boxes.
[20:53.52]It can't even count that high.
[20:58.85]50 boxes.
[21:00.87]Alright, now what about clothes?
[21:01.73]Maybe some extra clothes?
[21:02.81]10. 10.
[21:07.40]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:10.34]20.
[21:15.16]That's less.
[21:17.70]Oxen.
[21:18.18]All right.
[21:18.46]How about like 20?
[21:19.56]15.
[21:19.58]15.
[21:20.12]It won't let me buy more.
[21:24.68]I can only do single digits.
[21:26.08]Eight.
[21:27.35]There we go.
[21:30.93]I think we're good to go.
[21:40.66]More food.
[21:41.66]No, I don't need more food.
[21:42.92]How many pounds was it?
[21:44.32]2,000 pounds.
[21:46.04]Alright, that's 2,000 pounds of food.
[21:49.12]More ammo.
[21:50.00]More ammo?
[21:50.76]Alright, I'm going to say 75 boxes.
[21:56.49]More clothes.
[21:57.71]I guess I'll do a couple more clothes.
[21:59.93]30?
[22:05.16]Less oxen.
[22:05.94]Okay, I guess I'll...
[22:13.42]Well then, you're ready to start.
[22:14.76]Good luck, you have a long and difficult journey ahead of you.
[22:17.38]Okay.
[22:19.24]I knew there was sound.
[22:21.32]That's very loud for me.
[22:22.86]Hope it's not loud for you.
[22:27.84]March 1st, 1848.
[22:29.32]Which one of them is me?
[22:30.77]Oh look, there's Otto!
[22:35.91]Oh, I know what you guys are gonna say.
[22:39.44]It's cold.
[22:39.82]Health good.
[22:40.30]Pace steady.
[22:40.79]Rations filling.
[23:02.95]You may continue on trail.
[23:04.17]Check supplies.
[23:04.91]Look at the map.
[23:05.47]Change pace.
[23:06.97]Stop to rest.
[23:07.55]Let's just go on the trail.
[23:09.07]Talk to people.
[23:14.18]Let's go.
[23:15.68]From Independence, it is 102 miles to the Kansas River crossing.
[23:18.44]Date.
[23:18.94]It's cold.
[23:19.86]Let's go.
[23:21.40]Press enter to size up the situation.
[23:23.50]What do you mean size up the situation?
[23:27.66]What are you talking about, like MTV?
[23:28.76]Is he going to knock me out?
[23:29.86]Size him up?
[23:30.32]You want to come at me?
[23:31.28]You want to come at me, situation?
[23:34.14]That was pretty good, I liked that one.
[23:35.56]I don't care if you didn't, I liked it.
[23:38.49]Press enter to size up the situation.
[23:40.39]Severe blizzard, lose one day.
[23:42.19]What do we got for supplies?
[23:47.63]16 oxen, 1500 bullets.
[23:56.30]How do we already eat 50 pounds of food in one day?
[24:04.62]We're good.
[24:05.70]Cold, health good, food.
[24:08.05]Severe blizzard, lose a day.
[24:10.65]Go.
[24:13.29]What I used to do in math class is I would change it to the fastest you could possibly run and skip every single scenario and I could never get to the end and I never knew why.
[24:23.19]Press enter the side hole and size it up a little bit.
[24:25.29]Rations, filling, let's hold on.
[24:28.37]No, no, no.
[24:29.35]Everyone's not just going to eat and fucking scrape a bunch of potatoes and carrots into the trash.
[24:34.00]That's not going to happen.
[24:37.24]Okay, filling, meals are large and generous.
[24:39.26]No.
[24:40.14]Meals are small but adequate.
[24:41.96]Let's go with two.
[24:45.84]Okay, change pace.
[24:48.44]A grueling pace.
[24:52.21]I always love to do grueling pace.
[24:56.71]Only for like a few minutes, though.
[24:58.45]Not that long.
[25:01.35]Alright, let's go continue on the trail.
[25:04.59]Snowbound.
[25:05.21]Lose nine days.
[25:09.57]Did we- what, is it an avalanche?
[25:12.45]Go!
[25:14.39]You are now at the Kansas River Crossing.
[25:16.29]Would you like to look around?
[25:17.47]Yes.
[25:27.32]I can't do this one, sorry.
[25:31.97]It's pretty nice.
[25:32.53]Alright, Cairns River Crossing.
[25:40.79]Talk to people.
[25:41.37]Anybody around?
[25:43.19]A stranger tells you, can't afford to take a ferry.
[25:47.17]We're making our wagon into a boat.
[25:49.57]We'll turn it over, caulk the bottom and sides with pitch, and use it to float our goods across.
[25:55.79]Have to swim the animals.
[25:57.50]Hope it don't rain.
[25:58.98]The river's high enough.
[26:00.12]Okay.
[26:06.86]Anybody to trade with?
[26:09.83]You meet another emigrant who wants one set of clothing.
[26:13.87]He will trade you 76 bullets.
[26:16.35]Are you willing to trade?
[26:19.87]No.
[26:22.37]76 bullets.
[26:25.94]That's bad.
[26:26.40]Let me check the supplies.
[26:30.00]We're good.
[26:30.58]I got plenty of food.
[26:31.74]I got some money.
[26:34.18]Let's continue on the trail.
[26:35.86]You must cross the river in order to continue.
[26:37.93]The river at this point is currently 613 feet across.
[26:41.89]And 2.8 feet deep in the middle.
[26:44.07]Alright, so it's almost 3 feet deep.
[26:46.23]And it's 600 feet.
[26:46.97]3 feet deep.
[26:51.43]It's cold though.
[26:52.49]You may attempt to ford the river, caulk the wagon and float it across, take a ferry across, wait to see if conditions improve, get more information.
[26:59.11]We're gonna take a ferry.
[27:00.37]Take the ferry!
[27:01.71]The ferry operator says that he will charge you five dollars, and then you'll have to wait four days.
[27:06.57]Five dollars!
[27:09.23]That's it?
[27:10.85]Are you serious?
[27:11.65]Pay the premium every time.
[27:14.18]That's five bucks!
[27:24.47]Oh, yes, we're going.
[27:25.23]And look at all them swimming over there.
[27:28.95]Hey, sorry.
[27:32.33]We're just trying to go to the speed limit over here.
[27:37.53]Give me more cigarettes and coffee and chocolate on my fucking massive mansion boat.
[27:45.97]We're good.
[27:54.99]There's only six football fields.
[27:57.39]He's rich.
[28:03.48]Who's the guy on the right?
[28:12.20]I forgot he was there.
[28:13.38]All right, from the Kansas River, it is 82 miles to the Big Blue River crossing.
[28:17.21]Health, good weather, warm food, plenty of food, grueling.
[28:23.82]We're good.
[28:24.84]Everything's fine.
[28:27.22]You are now at the Big Blue River Crossing.
[28:28.88]Would you like to look around?
[28:29.87]Yeah.
[28:30.27]Let's get another song.
[28:42.62]Ma'am, I'm not entirely sure.
[28:46.70]as a doctor that's been in this field for over 35 years.
[28:52.12]We've never had somebody hooked up to a machine we thought was gonna die real soon and then this shit started happening.
[29:00.91]Just gotta get your camera out and Snapchat it, this is unbelievable.
[29:15.41]So we got checksplit.
[29:16.41]Let's see how we're doing.
[29:21.37]Snapchat is the most boomer thing you've ever said.
[29:24.10]Why?
[29:25.68]You guys don't like Snapchat?
[29:26.82]I haven't used it in a while.
[29:27.82]Alright, we're good.
[29:31.38]Uh, I would like to continue on the trail.
[29:32.56]Everyone's fine.
[29:34.18]You must cross the river in order to continue.
[29:35.88]The river is, at this point, is currently 248 feet across and 5 feet deep in the middle.
[29:42.33]Uh, I would attempt... Where's the ferry?
[29:49.82]I can't pay?
[29:50.46]I don't want to go in there.
[29:53.18]Excuse me, I don't want to go in the water.
[29:56.24]No, my things will get wet.
[29:58.57]Where's the ferry?
[29:59.47]Excuse me, ferry to take me across?
[30:02.93]And this is the part of the TV show or the movie where all the people I laughed at are walking by me now and are looking and like scoffing like, he's got to do it this way now.
[30:13.92]And I'm like, I can't.
[30:15.16]I don't think I can.
[30:20.59]Uh, how much is... let's see.
[30:26.29]He's role-playing in the Oregon Trail, yes.
[30:30.17]Yeah, yeah.
[30:32.69]I'm not gonna ford the river, we're gonna cock the wagon and float across.
[30:38.18]We're gonna turn into, like, fucking... Breadbox.
[30:41.20]Oh!
[30:56.59]Oh, okay.
[30:57.07]I'm dead.
[31:03.69]The way I get tipped over while floating, you lose 25 sets of clothing.
[31:08.47]What, did I have all the shirts on?
[31:11.41]Three, all right, hold on a minute.
[31:12.87]This doesn't make any sense.
[31:15.03]Was I just hoarding all the t-shirts?
[31:16.78]Was I doing like a t-shirt challenge video?
[31:20.70]And then the fucking boat tipped over?
[31:24.30]All right, I...
[31:35.04]Deep water.
[31:37.16]It wasn't even... No, it was less than that.
[31:38.92]It was like four... It was like three and a half.
[31:43.16]I was weighed down by cinder blocks, apparently.
[31:45.68]Okay.
[31:46.90]Whatever.
[31:47.50]I don't need to be alive.
[31:49.08]As long as one of me is alive, I don't care.
[31:52.69]Ugh.
[31:53.43]That's un-fucking-believable.
[31:55.31]Alright.
[31:55.99]It's 118 miles to Fort Kearney.
[31:58.77]Let's go.
[31:59.19]Blue's Trail.
[32:00.77]See, now you don't have me here, so I was good at navigating.
[32:06.13]People can eat now because I eat way too much.
[32:09.23]So now I can increase the food because I'm not around to eat at all.
[32:12.77]And do YouTube challenge videos and then drown myself with 25 different t-shirts on.
[32:25.04]Change the food.
[32:25.92]Let's go filling.
[32:28.51]Pace can stay at grueling because that's what we're going to do.
[32:33.53]Continue on the trail.
[32:34.69]Let's go.
[32:38.36]Press Enter to know we're good.
[32:39.46]Cool.
[32:39.80]Health is fair.
[32:40.70]Why?
[32:42.30]Hold on.
[32:42.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[32:42.96]Why is health fair?
[32:50.31]What's wrong?
[32:55.94]Oh, I'm not even close.
[33:06.95]Okay, let's get to Fort... Let's get to Fort Monopoly.
[33:11.48]Ah, shit.
[33:12.14]I gotta pay this guy 60 bucks.
[33:16.02]He's got a hotel on here already.
[33:17.64]Fort Kearney?
[33:18.29]What's that worth?
[33:22.51]You're now at Fort Kearney.
[33:23.39]Would you like to look around?
[33:24.23]Yes, I would.
[33:34.70]You died in your- you literally died in your neighbor's yard.
[33:38.66]No, I died in my neighbor's pool.
[33:45.48]Why did I have to draw him?
[33:50.70]Alright.
[33:53.78]Let's check the supplies.
[33:56.20]I got- I only have five sets of clothing.
[33:58.15]I have to get something.
[33:58.99]I have to trade.
[34:02.48]Attempt to trade.
[34:03.14]Can anybody have any clothes?
[34:06.00]You meet another immigrant who wants one wagon axle.
[34:08.93]You don't have this.
[34:10.03]Yeah, because I dragged it all down with me.
[34:14.43]Buy supplies.
[34:16.11]Okay, how much money do we have?
[34:17.69]You have $335 clothing.
[34:20.46]$12 per set.
[34:21.26]What's this fucking premium bullshit?
[34:32.01]A couple, one, two, three more.
[34:34.23]Four more.
[34:35.05]Okay, no more.
[34:43.87]I need axles too.
[34:45.77]God damn it.
[34:49.07]How much are they?
[34:51.43]Did I lose anything else?
[35:01.02]Ugh.
[35:03.82]Check supplies.
[35:05.91]Axles got closed now.
[35:07.29]I've got plenty of bullets.
[35:08.39]Nobody knows how to use a gun in this troop.
[35:12.85]How many?
[35:13.47]Anybody know how to use a gun?
[35:15.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[35:17.18]Let's take 1500 bullets.
[35:23.88]No, Jax doesn't know how to use a gun.
[35:25.56]Jax only knows how to use pretend guns.
[35:28.33]He's a video game star.
[35:34.90]Okay.
[35:35.54]I think we're good.
[35:36.08]I'm gonna stop to rest, though.
[35:38.68]At least get, like, bury me.
[35:40.15]What am I... At least put something somewhere to remember me.
[35:46.33]How many... Okay, we'll take one day off.
[35:50.15]Okay.
[35:54.00]It is 250 miles to Chimney Rock.
[36:00.64]Cool.
[36:00.96]Health is fair.
[36:01.96]Got plenty of food.
[36:06.56]You're still floating in your neighbor's pool.
[36:08.48]Wrong trail again.
[36:09.40]I wouldn't have done this.
[36:12.06]Somebody's stress eating because they lost the trail.
[36:14.78]Who is it?
[36:20.45]Oh, we're gonna get to a stump.
[36:24.93]I don't even feel invested anymore.
[36:26.47]I don't even feel involved anymore.
[36:30.16]Yes, I would.
[36:36.21]Happy New Year, everybody.
[36:42.92]It's April 18th.
[36:43.44]Why would they play this song?
[36:49.37]I would accept, like, Jan- like, December 31st, 1848.
[37:05.74]I can't get out of this.
[37:07.16]Okay, I guess I can.
[37:11.67]I'm going to change the pace.
[37:13.65]We're going to do strenuous.
[37:17.35]Let's take a look at the map.
[37:21.85]Your route, rivers, mountains, land, marks, forts.
[37:28.56]Okay, let's keep going.
[37:30.80]It is 86 miles to Fort Laramie.
[37:33.74]Yes.
[37:34.22]Severe blizzard.
[37:35.31]It's okay.
[37:36.37]It's snowy.
[37:38.01]We can make it.
[37:42.81]Don't need to size it up.
[37:43.97]I got plenty of food.
[37:44.81]I was correct in buying.
[37:45.77]You pass a grave site.
[37:46.99]Would you like to look closer?
[37:48.19]Yes, I would.
[37:49.25]Because I would like to be buried here.
[37:51.19]I would like to at least... Remember I told you.
[37:53.93]Here lies... Can we just like...
[37:59.95]Can we just, like, put me on there too?
[38:08.01]Hey, hey, hey!
[38:09.03]Come out and play!
[38:09.90]Am I supposed to know who that is?
[38:21.97]You are now at Fort Laramie.
[38:23.61]Would you like to look around?
[38:24.67]Uh-huh.
[38:33.63]That's just a baby toy that plays random songs.
[38:36.67]Oh, it comes with four songs!
[38:44.19]Alright, uh... How we doing?
[38:47.96]What happened?
[38:49.60]Let me check my supplies again.
[38:52.04]I got plenty of bullets.
[38:54.12]I got some money left.
[38:55.34]Pounds of food.
[38:55.98]We're good.
[38:56.84]We're good.
[38:59.82]190 miles to Independence Rock.
[39:04.27]Severe blizzard again.
[39:05.63]Weather warm.
[39:06.75]Interesting.
[39:08.51]Now, are you sure this isn't like ash coming from a volcano?
[39:17.80]Fair.
[39:18.20]Health fair.
[39:22.92]Warm.
[39:23.48]Fair.
[39:24.04]Here comes the rock.
[39:31.45]Get there.
[39:31.83]Come on.
[39:34.21]You are now at Independence Rock.
[39:35.53]I would love to look around.
[39:43.40]May 5th.
[39:46.50]If you smell... Alright, let's talk to somebody.
[39:53.57]Big Louie tells you...
[39:55.42]Goodbye, Platte River.
[39:57.28]Goodbye, sandy hills and white buffalo skulls.
[40:00.91]Now we climb the Sweetwater Valley to cross the Continental Divide at South Pass.
[40:06.67]Once across the Rockies, we'll make a steep descent into the Green River Valley.
[40:21.84]Find wild fruit!
[40:25.68]Did I find it?
[40:26.76]Size it up.
[40:28.86]Hunt for fruit.
[40:32.32]Enter key.
[40:33.45]To start or stop walking, point the rifle.
[40:37.95]Novice hunters.
[40:39.23]To point the rifle, expert hunters.
[40:40.95]In space bars, fire.
[40:42.73]Well, I'm a novice hunter, so...
[40:59.86]Yeah!
[41:00.36]I told you you shoot squirrels.
[41:09.74]Oh fuck, that squirrel was coming for blood.
[41:18.47]From the animals you shot, got 923 pounds of meat!
[41:32.67]How big was that buffalo?
[41:34.50]Was that buffalo as big as a car?
[41:48.00]Buffaloes are huge, holy shit.
[41:49.90]I don't know why that... I can only carry 100 pounds, who cares?
[41:59.53]Actually, yeah, they are.
[42:00.83]They are huge, aren't they?
[42:03.42]That just seemed like such an enormous, unbelievable number.
[42:06.10]This is what happens when you live in this current day and age.
[42:13.35]I did not believe that for a whole 10 seconds.
[42:15.73]900 pounds of meat.
[42:23.87]Click this link, link, link.
[42:25.07]Hold on, what do you mean?
[42:27.77]Hold on, first of all, my mouse is locked in.
[42:39.58]At least I got... Did the video... Did I public the video?
[42:45.71]That's fucking fast.
[42:57.60]No, I died.
[42:58.48]Well, hopefully someone will public my t-shirt challenge.
[43:01.68]Alright, continue on the trail.
[43:06.18]I can't believe I only have... Which rock is this one?
[43:17.05]You are now at South Pass.
[43:18.25]Let's look around.
[43:27.99]Do they talk about me when I'm gone, do you think?
[43:35.85]Plenty of clothes.
[43:38.43]Look at the map.
[43:39.85]I'm getting there.
[43:41.73]I'm going to get there.
[43:42.37]I'm going to get to the whole of Oregon.
[43:44.85]Talk to people.
[43:45.99]A young girl tells you.
[43:52.59]My father is very sick, and we are resting here until he gets better.
[43:57.03]We have been pushing too hard, and our health has suffered.
[44:00.35]When my father is able to travel again, we will go at a slow pace.
[44:07.56]Sorry.
[44:12.69]My father was fairly wealthy.
[44:16.65]That was the Otto voice.
[44:18.23]No.
[44:19.13]Hi everyone, this is Otto.
[44:20.59]That's the Otto voice.
[44:21.96]That was... I just... No, that was Otto... Yeah, that was Otto whispering.
[44:26.94]You were right.
[44:28.14]Don't you know every voice is a... A German quotes four voices, quote Albertson.
[44:42.95]Otto is cousin.
[44:46.53]The trail divides here.
[44:47.77]You may head for Green River Crossing.
[44:49.95]Head for Fort Bridger.
[44:51.86]See the map.
[44:52.68]Let's take a look.
[44:55.60]Hmm.
[44:56.82]This is our first ever choice.
[45:05.05]What's the... How do I go just straight as hard as possible?
[45:08.89]It's not Fort Bridger.
[45:10.73]We're going straight.
[45:12.99]as far, as fast as I can.
[45:22.64]Let you guys vote?
[45:25.56]Yeah, okay.
[45:27.34]Okay.
[45:29.33]Hold on.
[45:35.15]Okay, let's, uh, you guys can vote.
[45:37.67]Don't do it yet.
[45:43.50]I said don't do it yet!
[45:45.24]Don't do it yet!
[45:45.98]You have to wait, because I have to switch between, like, three screens.
[45:52.50]Stop it.
[45:54.96]Okay, don't, wait, stop.
[45:57.22]Here we go, ready?
[46:00.29]Don't do it yet.
[46:01.17]Don't do it yet.
[46:06.49]Hold on.
[46:07.87]Don't do it yet.
[46:13.17]Do it now.
[46:14.49]See, I have to wait, because I have to get it, like, squared up.
[46:21.79]How the fuck am I ever going to know what one you're clicking on?
[46:25.63]No, this is not going to work.
[46:31.48]Hmm.
[46:32.32]I think they're clicking on one, two, or three.
[46:36.55]I can't zoom in because my mouse is locked in the emulator.
[46:40.24]So I have to stay here.
[46:41.90]If I hit escape, I pull out and it screws the whole thing up.
[46:46.58]That looks like one to me.
[46:48.58]That's one.
[46:51.88]Alright, thanks for voting.
[46:52.96]Hold on, let me get this off.
[46:54.28]I have to hit the BRB.
[46:57.25]Thanks for playing.
[46:59.09]Astral Poe would just be easier.
[47:01.43]Yeah, it probably would.
[47:04.43]Okay, we're back.
[47:06.62]I'm going one.
[47:07.52]That's the one I was gonna pick anyways.
[47:11.60]Another river.
[47:13.36]Alright.
[47:18.10]You're now at Green River Crossing.
[47:19.54]Let's look around.
[47:26.29]This looks like a big river.
[47:30.69]Okay, check.
[47:31.85]How we doing?
[47:33.79]Talk to people.
[47:36.26]A Shoshone Indian tells you, when wagons first started coming through here, we did not mind.
[47:41.20]We even found it good to trade game and fish with the travelers and help them cross the rivers.
[47:46.38]Now there are too many white men and too little land for grazing.
[47:59.76]I mean, we did like, I mean...
[48:04.88]I mean, Native Americans.
[48:06.83]Like, we fucking... We fucked them.
[48:08.99]You know what I mean?
[48:09.81]Like, that's like... It was bullshit.
[48:12.07]They got a bad fucking deal.
[48:17.67]It's true.
[48:19.71]It's true.
[48:27.14]Bullets crossed.
[48:43.34]That's not political.
[48:44.62]No, that just, that's not.
[48:47.19]That's just, that's just, that's just the thing, right?
[48:51.71]I'm not gonna afford it.
[48:54.30]This is 20 fucking feet deep.
[49:05.29]You must cross the river in order to continue.
[49:07.17]The river at this point is 400 feet across and 20 feet deep.
[49:11.41]Take my money.
[49:12.65]Know what I mean?
[49:13.73]Take my money and get across safely.
[49:18.34]Take a ferry across.
[49:20.04]Use my money.
[49:21.50]I live on in my money.
[49:23.34]I live on through my capital.
[49:28.12]Take the ferry.
[49:31.10]It's only five bucks.
[49:33.06]Why could I not take it before?
[49:42.76]It's only $5.
[49:43.32]Yeah, take my money.
[49:48.13]Get over safely.
[49:50.51]Start a family with Jex.
[49:52.45]Kim and Jex.
[50:04.96]Virgin Germa.
[50:06.60]Chad Jex.
[50:08.72]Oh, fuck.
[50:10.50]From Green River Crossing, it is 143 miles to Soda Springs.
[50:20.11]People are good.
[50:21.29]Health is good.
[50:24.53]I think we can turn it to grueling.
[50:28.97]No, I'm not going to go hunting.
[50:29.82]I don't need it.
[50:30.32]I've got my money.
[50:31.78]Very little water.
[50:32.70]What do you mean, very little water?
[50:37.74]Yeah, drink from the spring.
[50:43.20]Oh, Otto sure got big.
[50:46.21]I know who's been eating all the food.
[50:47.69]Now I know who's been stress eating.
[50:57.93]Is this Inspector Gadget?
[51:04.62]No, it's not.
[51:13.93]Everything is Inspector Gadget, apparently.
[51:20.29]Okay, we need to... Let's see if we can trade with somebody.
[51:24.75]I got plenty of autos.
[51:27.85]Plenty of clothes.
[51:29.90]I might want to get some more food.
[51:32.93]Who wants f- Okay, look, look, look, look.
[51:34.63]We don't need bullets.
[51:35.83]418 bullets?
[51:38.57]He will trade you one ox.
[51:39.84]Do we need any more oxes?
[51:44.86]Uh, five community subs just came in from Cole.
[51:47.66]Thank you, Cole RG, for the five community subs.
[51:55.47]Why?
[51:56.31]Why?
[51:56.61]Hold on.
[51:57.01]Somebody just wrote, why do you have so much of everything?
[51:59.65]You casual bank of fuck.
[52:04.93]What?
[52:06.81]Jesus.
[52:19.34]Because it said from Boston, I had to click it.
[52:22.68]If it said that you're penniless from Boston, I would have clicked that one.
[52:26.48]All right.
[52:28.64]Are you willing to trade?
[52:29.52]No, it's my money.
[52:33.63]Alright, let's go.
[52:34.79]Let's go fast.
[52:36.43]Really fast.
[52:39.05]Go.
[52:40.94]57 miles.
[52:43.92]Inadequate grass.
[52:47.55]Inadequate grass.
[52:49.51]Yes, I'd like to look around.
[52:58.78]Big boy, Eggo, thanks for the five community subs.
[53:03.87]Five subs.
[53:04.61]Thanks for dropping in with five.
[53:09.21]Thank you.
[53:10.51]Thank you, big boy.
[53:13.68]I think it's time to buy some- I want to buy some more food.
[53:16.00]No, I don't.
[53:16.62]Whoa, holy shit, this is nice.
[53:18.24]No, look at that.
[53:22.22]That's pretty cheap.
[53:23.46]Is it?
[53:27.73]All right.
[53:28.37]I've got to save my money.
[53:31.05]Because now I need to take ferries every time.
[53:36.33]Talk to people.
[53:37.93]Fellow traveler tells you.
[53:41.32]Four voices.
[53:42.84]This one?
[53:43.32]Nope.
[53:44.56]This one?
[53:45.16]Nope.
[53:45.88]Two.
[53:47.18]This one?
[53:47.76]Three.
[53:49.02]I think four.
[53:49.94]Oh, which one?
[53:50.40]Damn.
[53:56.31]Fort.
[53:57.41]Fort Hall is busy, Fort.
[53:59.40]The wide stretches of meadow grass here are just what our tired animals need.
[54:03.40]As for me, I'll fix up the wagon leaks.
[54:06.02]Amanda's real anxious to wash all the clothes and linens in one of those clear streets.
[54:10.86]Five.
[54:13.24]You got five now.
[54:14.00]I got five voices now.
[54:17.66]I'll rest for two days.
[54:25.26]Go.
[54:25.44]Go.
[54:27.08]Inadequate grass.
[54:29.38]Bad water.
[54:32.00]What does that mean?
[54:34.55]Find wild fruit.
[54:37.81]Cool.
[54:40.23]You just ate it.
[54:41.03]There was just grass right there.
[54:42.71]Bad water, bad water.
[54:44.29]Health poor.
[54:45.09]Impassable trail.
[54:47.10]Hold on, what do you mean bad water?
[54:50.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:55.82]I'm stopping here to rest.
[55:00.50]No one wants to trade with you today.
[55:01.84]Okay, fine.
[55:05.00]Jeez.
[55:05.30]Alright, we're going to slow it down.
[55:08.24]Change pace.
[55:10.59]We're going to do steady.
[55:12.23]I'm also going to rest here for like three days.
[55:16.07]Three days.
[55:18.71]Health.
[55:19.69]Fair.
[55:20.85]Okay.
[55:22.44]Continue.
[55:25.00]One of the oxen is injured.
[55:27.08]Okay, that's why I bought 15 of them.
[55:32.23]Bad water.
[55:32.91]Bad water.
[55:33.69]Very little water.
[55:34.63]We're almost there.
[55:35.37]Just get there.
[55:37.27]Very little water.
[55:38.07]We're at water now.
[55:39.13]Find wild fruit.
[55:40.17]Why did that just pop up?
[55:43.37]You are now at the Snake River Crossing.
[55:45.31]Would you like to look around?
[55:46.40]Yep.
[55:49.64]June 20th, 1848.
[55:50.10]Okay.
[55:57.56]How we doing?
[55:58.36]Talk to people.
[56:00.42]A frantic wife tells you
[56:05.96]Every time I do a female voice, they're always British.
[56:11.00]Why?
[56:12.12]It says right here.
[56:14.70]It says.
[56:15.20]I don't know how to do a female voice.
[56:23.04]Paula Deen is the only female I can do.
[56:26.58]That's not.
[56:27.86]No.
[56:29.87]Female voice.
[56:31.09]That's not Paula Deen or Keira Knightley.
[56:36.80]um who's elmo paul dean is elmo ah it's it says um it says it says right here in the shiver shively guidebook you must hire
[57:03.24]an Indian to pilot you at the crossing of the Snake River, it being dangerous if not perfectly understood.
[57:08.61]But my husband insists on crossing without a guide.
[57:11.97]That's pretty good.
[57:12.61]Well, your husband's dumb.
[57:18.71]See you when we go across.
[57:32.76]I will take a... You must cross the river in order to continue.
[57:35.64]The port of affairs at this point is currently a thousand feet across and six feet deep in the middle.
[57:42.88]Okay.
[57:43.58]Attempt to ford the river.
[57:44.56]Cock the wagon and float it across higher.
[57:47.54]We're going to hire somebody.
[57:53.68]A guide says that he will take your wagon across the river in exchange for two sets of clothing.
[57:57.42]Yes.
[57:58.72]Can I give you like five?
[58:02.88]Thank you!
[58:04.20]Let's go!

[59:13.63]How do you break your leg in bed?
[59:19.89]Ah shit, I really twisted my ankle to a point where I shattered my bones.
[59:31.28]One of the oxen has died.
[59:33.62]Inadequate grass, it's okay.
[59:39.62]Italics got like gay for death.
[59:44.60]Yeah, you gotta get up, man, and stretch.
[59:51.52]Be careful.
[59:56.95]A thief comes during the night and steals 36 pounds of food.
[59:59.79]How?
[60:06.77]Broke a bone playing Fortnite.
[60:11.06]All right, well, whatever.
[60:13.10]I've got plenty of fucking food and money.
[60:17.16]I don't even know what happened.
[60:20.63]I've got so many pounds of food, I can't even count it.
[60:24.29]How do you count 900 pounds of food?
[60:26.93]It's just huge in there, and it's just whatever.

[62:48.71]Leave the store.
[62:50.27]Talk to people.
[62:51.99]Aunt Rebecca tells you... At every fort along the trail, prices have been higher than at the previous fort.
[63:01.99]This is outrageous, y'all.
[63:03.91]They're taking advantage of us.
[63:05.96]If I had the chance to do it again, I'd buy more supplies and independents.
[63:12.24]And I'd put a little more butter.
[63:16.98]I can only do a fucking Paula Deen.
[63:19.60]That's it.
[63:20.10]I can't do anything else.
[63:24.53]Do you need Paula Deen for your next project?
[63:27.57]I'm your guy.
[63:28.75]Need anything else?
[63:30.36]Just don't call me.

[64:39.71]All I saw was this.
[64:41.05]I saw this like fall in front of my face and hit me in the chest and I screamed.
[64:47.83]What's with this shirt?
[64:50.85]Look, when I was putting this shirt on, this shirt's like turning into cheesecloth because it's so old and my mother drew it.
[64:59.50]So I put my head on it and I ripped through right here, but I'm not getting rid of it.

[66:31.81]It is 160 miles to the Blue Mountains.
[66:34.59]Go, go.
[66:35.09]Very little water.
[66:35.89]I can't buy water.

[67:47.71]Nice.
[67:50.01]Thank God for those random babies.
[67:54.09]You're now at Blue Mountains.
[67:55.27]Would you like to look around?
[67:56.16]Water up on that mountain.
[68:06.83]Let's talk.
[68:09.13]No.
[68:09.77]Talk.
[68:13.41]Marnie Stewart tells you...
[68:18.34]We followed the edge of the desert from Fort Boise to the forbidding wall of the Blue Mountains.
[68:24.93]The hills were dreadful steep, locking both wheels, and coming down slow, we got down safe.
[68:33.65]Poor animals.
[68:35.20]No grass or water for days.
[68:39.44]Six voices!
[68:52.95]Going right for Boise.
[68:55.97]Head for Fort Walla or head for the Dallas.

[71:54.71]Can we take them down?
[71:58.61]Toll road is money.
[72:02.73]Toll road, that's five bucks.
[72:06.27]You must pay $12 to travel on the Barlow Road.

[74:23.38]I never even, like, played that game all the way through.
[74:26.00]I always just died in the first, like, 15 minutes every time.
[74:28.46]Alright, let's go back to the, uh, to the list of games.
[74:39.61]Like this.
[74:41.01]Here we are.
[74:42.09]Remember, if you want me to scroll, you click on the germaphase.
[74:47.64]Popsicle face.
[74:50.35]Because we are still... I mean, we just did the Oregon Trail.
[74:54.13]That's it.

[75:06.84]Click.
[75:07.94]Let's determine.
[75:08.64]You want me to scroll?

[76:15.10]People could just spam.
[76:29.99]Fucking Oregon Trail Deluxe.
[76:42.52]We just did this.
[76:47.46]All right, this is closing in 10 seconds.

[76:59.97]Ten.
[77:00.65]Oh, come on!
[77:01.67]Don't do this to me!
[77:02.67]Do I have to flip a coin?
[77:05.73]It was ti- I- I guess we're going.
[77:13.52]We're scrolling.
[77:19.74]I have to flip- I have to flip a coin.
[77:21.38]I have to.
[77:21.74]That's fair.
[77:22.28]That's the only fair way to do this.
[77:25.29]I stopped it and it was tied.
[77:27.32]Let's flip a coin.
[77:28.72]I don't have any coins up here.
[77:29.76]Alright, we're going to flip the wine cork.
[77:34.56]Okay?
[77:35.68]If it lands on wine stain side, then we're doing Oregon Trail Deluxe.
[77:41.39]If it lands on clean cork side, we're doing a scroll.
[77:46.11]Here we go.
[77:46.49]Ready?
[77:49.09]Wait, what is that going to do?
[77:51.16]Okay, yeah.

[77:59.74]Okay, so ready?
[78:01.65]If, what was it?
[78:03.03]If the clean's pointing up, we scroll, and if, okay, clean pointing up, scroll.
[78:49.72]I didn't want to play this.
[78:54.92]I never said I had to play it well.
[78:56.70]I'm going to try to die as fast as possible.
[79:02.73]I actually have a mouse this time.
[79:04.07]Hey, you're about to... You're about to begin a great adventure.

[79:11.38]Your covered wagon pulled by a team of oxen will travel from... Why didn't we just do this one first?
[79:24.83]Uh...

[80:00.75]They clicked scroll.
[80:01.65]Well, I closed the poll and like 15 seconds later it came through.
[80:07.63]I gotta close it at some point.
[80:09.09]Can't sit there forever.
[80:10.31]And I flipped the cork.
[80:20.58]No, not...

[82:42.96]Not many people carry feed.
[82:44.53]I'd rather wait, though, than cross a rickety... Okay.

[82:57.73]We're good.
[82:59.14]We made it.
[83:00.68]You made it across, but got stuck in the muddy riverbanks.
[83:03.00]That doesn't matter.
[83:07.59]Kim was bitten by a snake.
[83:10.41]In the water?

[83:44.34]It's only one feet deep.
[83:47.22]I just did this.
[83:56.05]Wait, somebody stole 15 bucks from the wagon?
[83:58.07]Who?
[84:01.23]You made it safely across.

[84:52.61]Three.
[84:53.36]This is how I used to play it back when I was in middle school.
[84:56.84]I didn't understand.
[84:57.76]Are they still eating food when I'm sitting here?
[85:02.60]Hey!

[86:18.31]We bought a number.
[86:19.13]They'd understand.
[86:19.99]Okay.
[86:22.89]Okay, let's go.
[86:23.71]Hunt.
[86:25.19]I can hunt for food.
[86:26.13]You can't go hunting because you don't have any bullets.
[86:30.07]Oh, I didn't buy any bullets because I didn't use them last time.
[86:37.41]Oops.
[86:37.69]Oops.

[87:26.44]He's 20 years old, he's 20 months old.
[87:29.88]Do hunting, please.
[87:34.54]Otto has cholera.
[87:35.84]Okay, I need bullets.
[87:40.32]Buy.

[87:43.02]I have $5.
[87:44.43]Bullets.
[87:47.09]Okay, I can get a box.
[87:49.03]I can get one box of bullets, which is 20 bullets.
[87:55.83]20 bullets at the store.
[87:56.75]Hunt.
[87:57.55]Hunting is not allowed near the fort because there are too many people around.
[88:00.41]Okay.
[88:09.32]What was that?
[88:10.94]I keep thinking that somebody's breaking their legs.
[88:12.68]There's no grasp of the auxin.
[88:15.30]Dermot Jr.
[88:15.74]got sick and died.
[88:16.70]Alright.
[88:23.21]Well, okay.
[88:24.01]Well... Hunt.
[88:28.65]Who's still alive?
[88:29.43]Otto and who?
[88:50.40]There's no bullet?
[88:50.96]There's no travel time?
[88:57.16]Pretty sick Sega Genesis sounds.
[88:59.69]How much, how much meat?
[89:03.79]You shot 2, 2,800 pounds of food and used 20 bullets.
[89:07.23]You can only carry 200 food back.
[89:09.01]Well, what's the point of shooting that many?
[89:12.31]All right, everybody rest.
[89:13.39]We're gonna rest for a long time, nine days.
[89:35.51]Didn't Otto die?
[89:40.25]No, no.
[89:46.31]Alright, everyone, people are recovering.
[89:53.65]Okay.
[89:57.14]Let's do a strenuous pace.
[90:00.66]Rations, let's go up to stay meager.
[90:04.66]Let's talk.
[90:06.67]Goodbye Platte River, goodbye Sandhills and white buffaloes.
[90:09.89]We already read this.
[90:12.27]Well, we already saw that.
[90:20.62]We're almost halfway there.
[90:23.00]You found some wild fruit and BS700 broke their arm pulling it out.
[90:27.06]Otto was bitten by a snake.
[90:28.64]He's dead.
[90:29.16]That's a death sentence.
[90:32.46]How do I cure his snake bite?
[90:40.23]Can I get poison cure?
[90:42.20]Is he just dead?
[90:44.44]Otto died of a snakebite.
[90:46.04]Yeah, number 700 is the only one left.
[90:51.66]He broke his arm picking berries.
[90:57.08]Wait, that quick?
[90:58.98]What?
[90:59.30]That was so fast.
[91:10.39]Oh, Otto died of a snake.
[91:11.63]Otto got bit by a snake.
[91:13.39]Oh no, a few days later, Otto died of a snake bite.
[91:16.99]P.S.
[91:17.61]700 just got sick and died immediately.
[91:20.99]We got to Independence Rock.
[91:24.10]Who's alive?
[91:26.36]Is it just the oxen?
[91:27.28]There's nobody alive.
[91:29.92]There's nobody on the- Wait, it's me!
[91:33.04]I'm still alive!
[91:35.93]I made it!
[91:36.71]This whole time!
[91:37.49]Alright, rest!
[91:38.69]Rest.
[91:39.13]All the food is mine.
[91:40.03]Nine days of rest.
[91:47.43]I'm taking this dead seriously now.
[91:57.02]I only need to... I have 300 pounds of food.
[92:02.62]I can eat as much as I want too.
[92:05.32]This is great.
[92:07.44]I'm gonna make it.
[92:10.47]Yeah, I'm gonna make it.
[92:11.15]Alright, everything's fair.
[92:22.09]I'm eating my fill.
[92:24.75]I'm just... Steak and mashed potatoes and green beans.
[92:30.82]It's perfect.
[92:35.99]Got to South Pass.
[92:38.31]Can we hunt?
[92:39.65]No, I don't have any bullets.
[92:40.49]I need to try to buy.
[92:41.81]You can only buy supplies at forts.
[92:45.03]What about trade?
[92:46.84]Bullets.
[92:48.10]I need, like, five.
[92:52.12]Nobody's got five bullets to spare.
[92:54.00]I find that really hard to believe.
[92:56.42]Head to fort to buy supplies.
[92:58.02]Take the shortcut to Green River.
[93:01.74]How much money do I have?
[93:04.95]I have two bucks.
[93:08.01]I can't buy anything.
[93:08.71]Alright, we're gonna take the shortcut.
[93:17.53]The water, I'll get the water soon.
[93:23.44]Come on.
[93:24.52]Go.
[93:27.32]The water is right here.
[93:32.56]Almost there.
[93:35.03]Yes!

[107:52.73]All right.
[107:53.71]Let's... Thankfully, there are no more Oregon trails on here.

[108:16.76]All right, so, how are we ever gonna get out of here?
[108:24.27]Click the germ of face if you wanna scroll, remember.

[109:35.00]I think this is just an absolute no contest.
[109:37.38]I'm going to scroll and scrolling means this whole page goes down.
[109:43.45]So we are going to go all the way down here to here.
[109:51.30]As you see.
[109:53.64]Here we go again.
[110:08.93]Ooh, we're indecisive this time.
[110:24.61]Leaning towards Batman Returns.
[110:26.45]A lot of people want to scroll, too.
[110:34.84]I think it's going to be Batman.

[112:30.27]You thought it would never end.
[112:32.75]Hell, a job as a Marine Reserve is so boring.
[112:36.71]You hate UAC.
[112:38.35]Nothing happens here.
[112:39.83]Even now, you have to wait for your fellow Marines who are supposed to check what happened on FOBOs.
[112:49.08]Not knowing what to do with yourself, you just sit near the comm console and listen to the news from your fellow Marines.
[112:58.89]Okay.
[113:02.56]Enter.
[113:04.76]Hell, what a bloodshed.
[113:06.98]You hear from the comm, corpses everywhere.

[113:43.84]Welcome to the Doom roguelike.
[113:53.44]Is that... is that me?
[114:09.72]It's one of these.
[114:11.28]It's actually like an old-school text-based adventure.
[114:18.36]There's a small medpack lying here.
[114:21.18]How do I pick it up?
[114:23.82]Unknown command.
[114:26.38]Oh, shit.

[115:29.77]Escape?
[115:30.31]No, it's not Backspace.
[115:31.59]It's Escape.
[115:33.47]Well... Hold on.
[115:38.45]Let me... Can I just... What if I press Escape again?
[115:42.55]There we go.
[115:42.95]Okay, it can't be in fullscreen.
[115:43.97]Alright, we're good.

[127:29.69]How many people worked on this game?
[127:47.00]There's no way it's the before credits.
[127:50.10]I'm pressing Enter, X, W, Q... Chevrolet!
[128:01.29]Oh, the after-credits scene!
[128:04.64]Are you fucking kidding me?

[128:17.73]Main computer.
[128:20.41]Oh my god, you are slow as shit, Batman.
[128:26.92]Batman, doing a great impression of, I'm pretending to work at the office.
[128:30.16]Alright, what?
[128:32.64]News broadcast.

[128:39.21]You don't have to be dressed like Batman.
[128:43.34]Uh, let's do news broadcast.
[128:51.15]This just in from Gotham Plaza.
[128:52.75]A gang of hooligans dressed as circus performers have attacked a crowd gathered to watch the annual tree lighting.
[128:59.00]Communication lines in the area have been disrupted, but as told, the violence is... The city council released a report today predicting that the Gotham City will suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.
[129:12.34]Revenues are far below projections and high expenses are higher than expected.
[129:17.66]The slumping economy bears most of the blame, according to the computer guy.
[129:21.60]What?
[129:22.46]The control, uh, the crime is up, the temperatures are down, and so are Gotham City's SAT scores.
[129:29.81]According to the Board of Education, the average Gotham student's score dropped by 25 points.
[129:38.20]No explanation was given.
[129:39.58]With a sharp decline in scores, the arctic weather which has left Gotham City numb, depressed and weary of winter shows no signs of letting up according to the US weather bureau forecast.
[129:48.97]Life sucks right now.
[129:51.57]By the way...
[130:17.13]A computerized forecast predicts a controlled climb as the city loses an estimated thousand jobs each month.
[130:23.39]This just in from Gotham Plaza.
[130:24.95]In breaking news, a gang of hooligans dressed as circus performers have attacked more people.
[130:37.96]Oh my god, that was a lot.
[130:44.13]Evidence?
[130:44.59]What's in the evidence folder?
[130:49.86]Uh, enter.
[130:51.30]No evidence to enter.

[131:05.61]Select video.
[131:06.79]There are no videos.
[131:07.97]Alright, let's get out of here.
[131:10.27]Get up from your fucking gamer chair, Batman.
[131:12.49]Let's go.
[131:23.08]Now where?
[131:23.48]Uh, I can go this way?

[131:30.50]Garage.
[131:36.59]Now he runs.
[131:38.61]Alright, ju- Why would you watch TV?
[131:46.85]You wanna watch TV while you're driving?
[131:49.89]The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.
[131:55.44]Revenues are far below projections.

[132:22.55]And... He soars through the air!
[132:34.22]While the driverless Batmobile... ...covering... ...the streets.
[132:44.06]Hitting people and...
[133:17.86]Why?

[133:32.52]That's the best game I've ever played.
[133:35.63]I gotta see.
[133:36.67]We can't just leave right now.
[133:40.39]No, new game.
[133:43.46]I'm sorry, that can't be how it ends.

[135:08.08]So, now, let me just, let's go to Wayne Manor.
[135:12.64]Have you completed everything you want to do on this day?
[135:14.62]No, why is this like, we're gonna, okay, go back into the Batmobile.

[136:10.34]He's looking through.
[136:16.46]And walking a tightrope.
[136:17.82]Doesn't Batman have gadgets?
[136:29.54]What's the point of doing this?
[136:42.25]He's just a cosplayer.
[136:44.43]This is not even real Batman.
[136:47.29]I don't think I can do anything here.
[136:56.75]What?
[136:59.59]Why didn't you just do that over here?
[137:01.33]I don't even know where I am.
[137:14.79]I can't go this way.
[137:15.85]The only thing I can do is go back.
[137:17.03]I guess I could go to the street level from over here.
[137:27.97]Oh my god.
[137:28.31]Okay, down to the street.
[137:42.75]Okay, liquor sale 50% off.

[138:19.43]It's not a yo-yo Batman.
[138:22.15]Alright, down to the street.
[138:36.56]What's going on?
[138:38.57]What the fuck is going on?
[138:41.50]How do I fight?
[138:42.74]I can't move the mouse up here.
[138:45.06]I can't fight this guy.
[138:47.24]It's just easy, normal, fierce?
[138:50.36]Fierce?
[139:03.37]Yes, I want to interrogate.
[139:05.63]Category of the question.
[139:08.43]Batman is high as fuck right now.
[139:11.15]Now I get it.
[139:14.06]Uh, leader.
[139:16.44]Tell me who you're working for.
[139:17.62]A real fish lover, that's for sure.
[139:22.14]Try one.
[139:24.08]What?
[139:27.82]Another fight.
[139:30.42]I don't know what any of these do!
[139:31.81]Smoke bomb!
[139:32.19]Stomp!
[139:32.53]Is that it?

[139:34.81]Uh, I-
[140:01.36]What time is it?
[140:02.10]It's 7.50 p.m.
[140:04.77]Did I kill these people?
[140:07.69]Go up.
[140:15.43]Wrap back around.
[140:16.11]Oh, my god.
[140:23.00]No one's here.
[140:28.16]It's a fish, for sure, right?
[140:29.70]What is it?
[140:30.10]Is it supposed to be a clue?
[140:33.81]Oh, here we go.
[140:36.53]Satan?
[140:36.81]He's dead.
[140:37.13]I killed him.
[140:37.67]These are all lethal somehow.
[140:38.57]I think I cleared them.
[140:39.46]Back to the...
[141:10.65]Alright, back to the Batmobile.
[141:13.39]I got some intel.
[141:18.49]What about the news?
[141:20.77]Wait, let me take my eyes off the road.
[141:22.59]The riot which broke out in the plaza several hours ago has now spread to the downtown area.
[141:28.07]Costumed marauders are terrorizing citizens and wrecking property throughout downtown.
[141:33.33]Police seem unable to quell the disturbances.
[141:36.03]The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.
[141:40.85]In case you forgot, revenues are fucked.
[141:44.11]No one's making any money.
[141:45.05]Jobs are gone.
[141:47.78]Batcave, downtown.
[142:03.56]I don't have any more, uh, equipment left.
[142:05.56]Yeah, I do.
[142:10.39]Alright, just... just punch him in the face.
[142:20.61]Fierce.
[142:21.93]I keep killing them.
[142:25.77]I need to interrogate them, so just knock them out.
[142:30.39]Come on, Batman.
[142:31.55]This person's not even attacking, just punch them.
[142:34.64]Just punch, just punch her in the face.
[142:38.32]Just punch them in the face!
[142:42.41]Oh, I guess that, oops.
[142:58.79]Use the bat gun.
[142:59.69]No, I don't want to hurt, I want to interrogate somebody.
[143:08.50]Bank?
[143:09.78]No, they're gone.
[143:10.70]There's nobody here.
[143:11.30]Alright, get me out of here.
[143:18.41]I need more news!
[143:21.19]Crime is up, the temperatures are down, and so are Gotham City's SAT scores.
[143:24.63]This guy just can't get over that.
[143:27.11]I'm not gonna eject.
[143:27.95]Alright, how do I get back to... I gotta go back to Wayne Manor.
[143:33.12]Batcave.
[143:36.24]Mayor's office?
[143:47.83]What's on here?
[143:49.89]Evidence?
[143:53.69]Nothing.
[143:58.10]No, there ain't nothing here.

[144:43.04]Okay, view.
[144:43.74]Frozen fish.

[144:47.78]Native to the icy waters off the coast of Antarctica.
[144:51.56]Okay, extrapolate.
[144:55.63]Not eaten by people used primarily as food for arctic avian species such as penguins.
[145:00.57]Only known purveyor of this fish in Gotham City is Tony's Fish Market.

[146:18.48]Zoo.
[146:20.70]Thanks for your help, Zoo-san.
[146:22.78]I'm sorry I'm so fucking high right now.
[146:27.71]Zoo?
[146:28.45]Did you say Zoo?
[146:34.25]Old Gotham Zoo.
[146:35.07]Old Gotham Zoo.
[146:46.63]arctic world well what else is over here oh a videotape take it take the tape we have some evidence now oh what's this circus poster take it
[147:16.53]Alright.
[147:17.59]Oh wait, we're gonna fight a clown.
[147:22.29]Normal.
[147:24.85]I don't care if this guy dies, just kill him.
[147:26.77]Just batarang him in the head.
[147:34.43]Try something else.
[147:37.17]Anything else we'll do.
[147:39.61]Anything we'll do, both of you.
[147:41.96]Dude, I think we froze to death down here.
[147:51.25]Would you like to interrogate?
[147:52.11]Yes.
[147:55.82]Location.
[148:00.28]Where can I find your boss?
[148:06.30]He'll be visiting the bank tonight, making a withdrawal.
[148:17.13]Okay.
[148:18.65]I'll make sure to stop him.
[148:22.38]I guess.
[148:22.74]Bank.
[148:42.66]Bank.
[148:43.16]Where's the bank?
[148:44.72]Where's the bank?
[148:45.87]Mayor's office downtown.
[148:47.53]Gotham Plaza.
[148:49.11]Fish market.
[148:49.75]Where's the bank?
[148:53.63]Is the bank on this side or the other side?
[149:04.81]Jewelry.
[149:05.31]Jewelry.
[149:15.71]Did the music get louder, or am I fucking insane?
[149:17.95]You might not be insane.
[149:23.08]I think it just hurts to listen to, so it just feels like it's getting louder.
[149:25.94]Bank!
[149:26.24]7.56, am I early?
[149:30.83]I'm too early.
[149:46.04]7.59.
[149:46.08]Is this real time?
[149:46.84]8.01.
[149:46.86]Is it 8?
[149:47.39]What time did they do this?
[149:54.89]I can skip time?
[149:57.27]How do you do that?
[150:20.59]Advance.
[150:21.87]An hour.
[150:22.75]Two hours.
[150:23.73]Return to game.
[150:24.31]Alright, are they here?
[150:33.85]Why don't you... Let's go!
[150:34.95]It's ten... Eleven o'clock.
[150:43.00]Here we go.
[150:45.22]It's the penguin!
[150:51.05]Uh-oh.
[150:51.67]Here's a gun!
[150:52.67]Quick, throw a batarang in his eye!
[150:55.43]He blocked it.
[150:56.07]Fierce!
[150:57.27]Get in there, get in there and start punching.
[151:01.15]Why is the penguin this good at fighting?
[151:04.01]The penguin's not supposed to be this good.
[151:07.19]Fierce, get in there, Batman!
[151:08.57]Take him out!
[151:09.07]Alright, couple more of those.
[151:12.80]Why is he here by himself, walking in the front door?
[151:21.67]Don't you think you would do something differently here?
[151:25.55]Injustice 3.
[151:28.58]Alright, please don't lose this.
[151:34.50]How many punches in the face is a penguin gonna take?
[151:36.60]Hahahaha!
[151:47.88]Come on.
[151:49.04]End this.
[151:50.42]Don't let him get the best of you.
[151:52.82]If the Penguin can beat Batman in a one-on-one combat scenario, it might be time to retire.
[151:59.02]There you go.
[152:04.38]Get in.
[152:17.26]Is Fierce the- Okay, his top henchmen.
[152:34.21]Here come the clowns.
[152:35.91]Why can I do this so well?
[152:37.11]I just- I did a backflip off of his face.
[152:39.57]I'm doing like weird karate Mortal Kombat moves and shit now.
[152:42.49]I was afraid- Look at these moves!
[152:44.87]Why was I not doing these before?
[152:56.98]Oh, would you like to interrogate?
[153:01.06]Yes.
[153:03.38]I want the location.
[153:07.71]I want your boss.
[153:09.31]Where is he?
[153:10.81]Where is he?
[153:12.73]I don't know, but he'll be making a withdrawal later tonight at the bank.
[153:15.69]Later tonight?
[153:17.15]At the bank?
[153:18.53]Okay.
[153:20.49]Where is he?
[153:23.44]What time is it?
[153:25.25]11.30.
[153:26.25]Okay.
[153:41.34]A mirror match.
[153:44.44]I chose...
[153:48.82]That was a backflip!
[153:50.76]I punched you so hard you did a full backflip.
[153:59.33]This is an old lady.
[154:00.81]This is clearly a grandma.
[154:03.81]Just push her over.
[154:06.97]Push her!
[154:08.31]Just shove.
[154:10.65]What's this?
[154:12.41]What's going on?
[154:12.87]Why is this blinking red?
[154:17.86]Why is my stone blinking?
[154:22.55]What does this mean?
[154:25.25]Is this a bomb?
[154:28.17]No.
[154:28.41]I don't know what that means.
[154:29.71]I have to wait at the bank.
[154:35.21]What time is it?
[154:36.51]It's 1150.
[154:37.31]He's gonna make a withdrawal.
[154:38.29]I just have to hold on.
[154:39.07]Alright, wait an hour.
[154:53.30]Okay, here comes the withdrawal.
[154:55.62]Here we go, here he comes!
[154:57.78]I came back!
[155:01.74]I forgot!
[155:03.14]I was gonna deposit a few chips too, Batman!
[155:12.31]Bruce, you might want to do something here.
[155:14.05]Bruce!
[155:19.11]Get in there!
[155:20.91]Easy?
[155:21.21]Should I put it on easy?
[155:26.79]No, this is too defensive.
[155:27.73]Get in there.
[155:28.25]Normal.
[155:33.74]You are so bad!
[155:36.24]Fierce.
[155:37.22]At least you were landing shots.
[155:46.76]How many times do I have to hit him?
[155:50.71]I think I have to put... Okay, I know what I have to do.
[155:52.85]I gotta put it on easy when he attacks, because that means I block...
[155:58.61]And then go back to Fierce.
[156:14.38]What a bullshit strategy that's working.
[156:16.32]It's not fair.
[156:17.48]Look at that reach.
[156:18.50]Batman, do something.
[156:20.02]Anything.
[156:21.08]I would take anything at this point.
[156:26.80]I'm just relying on dodge rolls.
[156:30.87]Get in there!
[156:35.19]Finally!
[156:36.05]Punch!
[156:37.65]Oh my god!
[156:41.77]Where is he?!
[156:50.12]Oh, he's gonna make it a deposit later tonight!
[156:55.63]It's fucking 1230.
[157:06.70]Batman's going on no sleep.
[157:10.71]No, they're gone.
[157:12.33]Alright, back to the... I gotta watch the videotape.
[157:30.34]Put the tape in, let's see what it is.
[157:40.71]Remember that time when Batman fought the penguin for three hours outside of a bank, twice?
[157:46.43]Okay, video.
[157:50.33]Select video.
[157:52.10]No, do I have to administer evidence?
[157:57.17]Okay, enter evidence.
[157:59.01]Red triangle circus poster, videotaped from zoo, collected evidence, entered.
[158:08.10]Video from the zoo.
[158:09.80]Play.
[158:11.98]My god!
[158:13.36]The penguin man of the sewers!
[158:16.70]What?
[158:18.50]Shut up, Max!
[158:21.34]You know you and I have a lot in common.
[158:25.63]We do?
[158:27.53]Of course.
[158:29.73]We both crave respect.
[158:33.14]And power.
[158:35.30]You can never have too much power, you're right.
[158:39.30]I've been hiding in the sewers for too long.
[158:43.41]It's time for me to ascend.
[158:46.89]And I want your help.
[158:50.17]I think I can work out a welcome home scenario that will benefit both of us.
[158:59.20]Transmit to the police.
[159:01.28]Wait, transmitting?
[159:01.92]Who am I transmitting to?
[159:04.12]Am I putting this on TV?
[159:08.14]Did I just pump into every cable box?
[159:14.02]Quick, put it on the air.
[159:15.99]It'll embarrass them.
[159:23.33]Streaming it on Twitch.
[159:25.33]I guess I'm transmitting this.
[159:28.27]Yeah, why were they recording this?
[159:32.59]Why would you re- record your damning conversation?
[159:41.54]And yeah, they're standing very- okay, I did it.
[159:44.68]I transmitted it.
[159:46.16]Apparently.
[159:48.26]Got big bits coming in!
[159:49.78]Cure!
[159:51.64]Cure, thank you for the 55 dollars, Cure.
[159:53.55]55 bucks.
[159:56.91]Huge money drop right here.
[159:59.60]And Cure says, Hey, I love it when you play shitty old games.
[160:03.34]Brings me back.
[160:05.22]You're me and my brother's favorite person on the internet.
[160:07.16]I've been watching you for a long time and it seems like you just keep getting funnier.
[160:11.21]Keep being you as long as you're having fun.
[160:12.79]We always are right there with you laughing our asses off.
[160:15.41]Thanks for the years of free laughs.
[160:16.67]Here's me giving back a little.
[160:17.73]Thank you so much.
[160:22.18]That means a fucking lot.
[160:23.42]Thank you.
[160:26.63]It's my pleasure.
[160:27.79]And yes, I do have a lot of fun when we play these games.
[160:36.37]Thank you so much, Kira.
[160:39.93]Say hello to your brother for me too.
[160:46.32]So, and that Batman music just like blasting in the background.
[160:52.43]Alright, this is going to drive you crazy.
[160:56.41]Videotape from the zoo.
[160:57.17]One of the two principals apparently likes to keep a video record of his meetings.
[161:00.43]They have formed an alliance and appear ready to use devious means to gain power.
[161:04.75]But he videotapes every meeting?
[161:08.06]I would not be okay with that.
[161:11.56]There were many rumors linking the Red Triangle Circus to criminal activity.
[161:14.26]It's likely that at least some of the members turned to crime full-time over the circus characters involved in the riot at the plaza.
[161:24.73]What's on the news today?
[161:27.35]Lecronda just gave $50.
[161:31.47]Oswald the Cobblepot foiled a kidnap attempt on the mayor.
[161:34.59]Little is known about Cobblepot's background.
[161:36.25]He appears to suffer from a congenital deformity that gives him a very penguin-like appearance.
[161:44.47]The arctic weather which has left Gothamites numb, depressed, and weary.
[161:47.44]What?
[161:47.70]No, we're going in this loop again.
[161:49.54]Lecronda says eject.
[161:53.33]For $50, thank you.
[161:55.01]Back-to-back 50 bucks.
[161:56.29]Thank you, both of you.
[162:00.79]Uh... Okay.
[162:03.19]Let's... I'm not gonna eject.
[162:10.87]I'm gonna go to the vault.
[162:11.67]I have to replace my Batsuit.
[162:13.39]This one's broken.
[162:14.07]See, look.
[162:18.27]Ready?
[162:20.01]100%, 100%, right?
[162:24.07]Offensive capability zero.
[162:29.92]What do you mean zero?
[162:34.56]Is this suit made out of concrete?
[162:36.36]I don't get it.
[162:40.79]Wait, there's a link that I need to look at?
[162:46.84]You went too hard.
[162:48.08]Hold on, wait, there's a link I need to look at.
[162:52.24]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, what's the link?
[162:56.54]You even put my nose bump in that photo, in that image.
[163:15.65]That's the best part about that.
[163:17.21]Alright, here we go.
[163:25.56]We need to go to sleep.
[163:26.32]I'm gonna give this game, like, another 15 minutes.
[163:29.54]I don't know how much more of this I can take.
[163:48.13]Okay.
[163:49.89]And we have the mayor's house.
[163:53.43]Gotham Plaza.
[163:54.25]Mayor's office.
[163:56.33]We're gonna go to the mayor's office.
[164:01.61]What time is it?
[164:02.13]6 p.m.
[164:04.21]He's not here?
[164:04.79]Just wait here.
[164:05.29]Ooh, hold on.
[164:08.23]Party pictures.
[164:08.99]Scan.
[164:12.46]Scan them.
[164:16.72]Scan.
[164:18.52]Just take them.
[164:21.17]Alright, I got some evidence here.
[164:26.93]Alright, get me the fuck out of this.
[164:35.46]I don't want to look at this desk anymore.
[164:39.30]Okay, pictures.
[164:40.12]What's in the pictures?
[164:50.42]Does he take photos of himself too?
[165:01.44]Is it weird that I want to do this again on the next stream?
[165:06.25]I feel like we're just touching the iceberg here.
[165:14.68]Evidence.
[165:18.35]Oh, maybe, like, do it next weekend, too?
[165:20.01]Okay, uh, enter.
[165:25.59]Photos of the mayor's son.
[165:30.19]What?
[165:30.69]Wait.
[165:31.51]Pack of photos of the mayor's son's birthday party.
[165:38.53]No useful extrapolation can be made at this time.
[165:48.10]Alright, I think, I think we've, I don't know what to do.
[165:50.34]I don't know what else to do.
[165:52.30]Watch the news?
[165:53.02]Unemployment, no, we already know about the unemployment.
[166:07.09]Oh no, not the SATs again.
[166:12.50]What the hell is there a reason for the eject button?
[166:14.69]There is no reason for the eject button.
[166:15.91]It doesn't- It just explodes the car.
[166:19.39]Alright.
[166:20.45]Last day.
[166:21.65]Make it count.
[166:23.02]Gotham Zoo.
[166:24.48]Bat Cave.
[166:26.18]Mayor's Office.
[166:26.88]Downtown.
[166:28.22]Fish Market.
[166:28.92]Let's go downtown.
[166:41.31]Nobody here.
[166:52.01]Steal something.
[166:52.91]I can't.
[166:53.37]I'm Batman.
[166:55.40]Batman doesn't steal.
[166:56.18]What about over here?
[166:56.72]We... Saw a light just turn off there.
[166:59.66]Down to the street.
[167:04.12]If there's nothing here, then we're gonna move on.
[167:09.05]I think we're stuck.
[167:09.85]We have to do something specific.
[167:11.03]Yeah, I think that's it.
[167:15.57]I think that's it.
[167:17.71]It was fun.
[167:20.49]One more try.
[167:22.11]I'm gonna go to the fish market.
[167:23.87]It closed.
[167:24.13]Aw, damn it!
[167:26.46]What time is it?! !
[167:35.57]8.58?
[167:35.79]They close at 9.
[167:37.75]Bullshit.
[167:38.53]God, I drove all the way out here.
[167:39.99]Fuck it.
[167:42.15]Well, that's it for that one.
[168:06.79]Well, thank you, Batman Returns, for probably the hardest I've laughed in two or three weeks, at least.
[168:14.28]That was a classic.
[168:16.24]I am going to go pee.
[168:20.58]I'll be right back.
[171:56.33]So, yeah, I think... What do you guys think?
[172:03.54]This is what I think.
[172:05.44]It's 4,400 games.
[172:10.62]That's... I feel like we could make this like a Saturday night thing.
[172:17.15]You know what I'm saying?
[172:24.29]At least for, like, a couple weeks.
[172:28.13]Just do I have to have this be just something fun to do, like, Saturday night?
[172:37.33]Just to check out some old DOS games, you know, whatever?
[172:44.24]On top of other streams, right?
[172:45.72]Because this is for this week, so...
[172:50.12]I don't see why I wouldn't do this again.
[172:52.96]This is fucking... No, I'm having a... This is a lot of fun.
[172:58.94]Maybe not permanently, but at least for like the next maybe two or three weeks.
[173:02.12]Try it.
[173:04.20]But speaking of stuff, I... Here we go.
[173:11.29]We were... We did not choose to scroll.
[173:14.65]We were right here.
[173:16.71]The last one was Batman.
[173:19.13]Right?
[173:19.33]We didn't choose to scroll.
[173:20.94]Was it here or was it?
[173:21.78]It was here, right?
[173:31.64]Let's keep going.
[173:33.30]Probably going to drop a lot of frames.
[173:35.72]That's another reason why I started an hour or two early.
[173:39.06]Because I'm trying to beat the internet problems that start at like 5 to 6, 7 o'clock.
[173:46.28]So at this point, we're probably going to start dropping frames.
[173:48.95]Apologize in advance.
[173:52.15]But let me get the thing here.
[173:54.05]Remember, if you want to scroll down another set of pages.
[173:58.83]Here we go.
[174:01.35]Are you ready?
[174:02.79]Click the screen.
[174:12.78]Don't use the image.
[174:16.22]I'll make it something else after this.
[174:18.00]Just so people are like, oh, I'm going to click the face, right?
[174:19.96]I see what you're saying.
[174:30.94]While you guys do that, I'll do this.
[174:59.36]This means scroll.
[175:09.03]So, uh, what are we doing here?
[175:10.95]I think we're scrolling.
[175:12.45]I think we're doing a scroll.
[175:16.15]We are.
[175:18.44]Stop it for now.
[175:22.60]We're doing one full scroll to here.
[175:29.57]Which gives us this new set.
[175:33.87]And let's... Wait, what do we mean?
[175:35.55]Rigged?
[175:35.79]What are we talking about?
[175:37.39]Wait, what happened?
[175:39.60]rigged what are you talking about was it it was 30 like three percent right hold on did I did I that up 70 was not voting
[176:06.45]Reset the face.
[176:07.27]Okay, no, you're right.
[176:08.37]Okay, okay, all right.
[176:08.97]I see what you're saying.
[176:10.03]I see what you're saying.
[176:10.65]No, I see what you're saying.
[176:11.23]You're right.
[176:13.82]No, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[176:20.14]Because there are people that may have just clicked the face.
[176:26.73]Okay.
[176:31.49]Well, if there was ever any indication of what people wanted, I think we've got a good clear indicator now.
[176:44.71]I don't think this is one guy.
[176:45.81]I think this might be 58% of all one guys in the chat.
[176:48.47]58% of guys.
[177:02.35]All right, that's very clear.

[177:38.20]No way.
[177:41.74]Not playing soft porn 2.
[177:46.24]You're wasting your vote right now.
[177:52.65]We must know, and my channel... You understand I can't stream porn on Twitch.
[178:02.10]I don't know if you've ever read the Terms of Service, but porn is not streamable.
[178:07.86]Even if it is probably like two bits that are... It's just text.
[178:18.07]You think I can... You want me to roll those dice?
[178:22.06]I don't know what that is.
[178:23.00]It could be like, it could flash an image of like, something crazy.

[179:13.66]Three weeks is a year.
[179:15.68]No porn!
[179:18.52]All it takes is for one thing to flash on that screen.
[179:22.90]And bingo.
[179:24.88]I'll see you guys in two weeks.
[179:26.77]Because I get Terms of Service banned.
[179:34.03]Sim Ant.
[179:38.95]We're not going to report you.
[179:40.72]Alright, Sim Ant.
[179:42.10]This copy of Sim Ant is registered to Robert...

[180:17.23]Welcome to the Sim Ant Tutorial.
[180:18.65]Just follow the on-screen instructions and you will learn how to play the game.
[180:24.29]Alright.
[180:25.13]In SimAnt, you are the yellow ant that you see in the window before you.
[180:28.81]First, you will learn to control your ant.
[180:34.49]Try double-clicking somewhere in the brown dirt near the yellow ant.
[180:37.45]Is that the queen?
[180:43.67]Good, you've just learned how to dig a tunnel.
[180:45.07]Try digging some more to get the hang of it.
[180:58.30]What's wrong?
[180:58.62]What are you doing?
[181:05.45]Now go outside and explore the surface.
[181:06.75]Double click on the blue area at the top of the window to dig a tunnel to the surface.
[181:13.33]Oh shit, okay.
[181:15.42]Now you're outside.
[181:16.00]This is called the surface view.
[181:17.18]You can die up here.
[181:23.18]To move in the surface, just click on the ground and you'll move.
[181:25.12]Alright, yeah, I can move around.
[181:33.34]When do we get raid?
[181:35.66]Hey.
[181:35.92]Hey, easy.
[181:39.59]That's right.
[181:40.01]Now click on your ant to recenter the window.
[181:48.29]Just go off and adventure?
[181:50.17]Good.
[181:50.43]Now here's another way to scroll up the screen.
[181:51.71]Move the mouse cursor to the far edge of the screen.
[181:53.47]Yep, yep, yep.
[182:02.56]Oh boy.
[182:07.27]Now it's about time to find some food for your colony.
[182:09.19]Under the window menu, select MAP.
[182:22.82]The window is a view of the whole patch.
[182:25.76]The green dots in this window are food.
[182:27.98]The yellow dot is your ant and you may see other things moving too.
[182:31.42]Eject.
[182:35.51]get a bearing on which way the food is located in the patch, then select edit under the window menu to bring up the close-up view of the surface again.
[182:41.65]All right, so I gotta go right.
[182:45.98]So I gotta go this way.
[182:50.16]There it is.
[182:51.72]Try to get some of the food.
[183:03.28]All right, I got the food.
[183:09.38]Very good, you've made it.
[183:10.28]You are probably hungry by now, so double click on a piece of food.
[183:18.22]That tasted good, didn't it?
[183:19.40]Now you feel like a new ant.
[183:25.54]Now it's time to bring a piece of food back to your colony.
[183:27.31]Double click on another piece of food to pick it up.
[183:29.23]Would you guys just let me get through the damn tutorial?
[183:37.22]Let me just at least do that.
[183:41.04]This is what was voted on.
[183:41.96]You have to give it at least a few minutes.
[183:43.76]We can't just be like, I want you to play SimAnt.
[183:47.52]Get out of SimAnt, quick.
[183:50.06]You're putting me to sleep.

[192:22.66]Something, have her, something, something, have her something my wand.
[192:36.87]Don't get discouraged if you wipe out on the first couple tries.

[201:19.82]That was a lot of fucked up shit I couldn't read.
[201:22.96]You got your... You got it.
[201:24.15]There it is.
[201:25.60]There's a made-for-TV version.
[201:33.22]Let us go back.
[201:36.30]Shall we?
[201:38.72]All right, so that was here, right?
[201:44.04]That's correct, right?
[201:45.14]We didn't move on from here?
[201:48.04]All right.
[201:49.74]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could do me a favor and...
[201:53.87]Put your mouse over the screen in a certain place.
[201:55.59]The red arrow means you want to scroll down another page.
[202:00.17]Good luck.
[202:11.82]Interesting.
[202:14.16]Interesting selection.
[202:18.54]A question for the audience here.
[202:21.06]Do I have to play a full round of Monopoly?
[202:24.80]Why would you want me to do that?
[202:31.16]Is that... You want me to... Okay, hold on.
[202:34.97]A third of you guys want me to play a full round of Monopoly like a 25-year-old version by myself versus the computer.
[202:50.78]That can't be right.
[202:54.80]I just, that can't be right.
[202:55.62]I don't think, I can't, that can't be right.
[203:01.14]That is correct, yes.
[203:04.32]Democracy sucks.
[203:10.56]What do you, what do you mean straw poll?
[203:13.33]There's an interactable straw poll on the screen right now.
[203:18.27]Straw, and I just did it.
[203:24.13]Okay, do a straw poll!
[203:35.21]The people have spoken, guys.
[203:37.77]I could veto it, but... I'm toying with the idea.
[203:52.26]I don't understand chat sometimes.
[203:55.95]I don't understand this chat sometimes.
[203:57.90]No one would actually stay and continue talking if a full thing of Monopoly was played.
[204:02.12]You'll get up and leave.
[204:04.30]You'll get up and leave it in the background, which means you aren't fucking watching.
[204:10.59]If you're here to watch someone play a game, pick a game, sit down, shut up, and watch him play.
[204:16.89]65% don't want Monopoly.
[204:25.81]Yeah, but look at all the other... Look at... You're evenly spread out a bunch of other games.
[204:29.88]How about this?
[204:30.58]I will at least get... I'll at least go to jail in Monopoly.
[204:34.34]You know what I mean?
[204:34.80]And we'll get the... Don't you be coming back here now.
[204:39.69]It is commenced.
[204:40.55]Monopoly.
[204:49.74]Okay.
[204:59.71]If I gave 15 minutes to SimAnt, I will give 10 to Monopoly.
[205:02.99]There's going to be like a five round Monopoly.
[205:05.28]They always do it like this.
[205:06.18]Watch.
[205:09.90]I can pick the amount of rounds, right?
[205:11.18]Well, this isn't Mario Party.
[205:12.68]What?
[205:14.58]That's not how this works.
[205:17.48]All right, let's go.
[205:18.24]How do I play?
[205:18.82]Monopoly, go.
[205:26.08]New game.
[205:28.42]Alright, player setup.

[205:38.52]XT clone.
[205:40.62]386, 30... Okay, why can I play against a microwave?
[205:44.27]Human, a calculator, a computer, or a microwave.
[205:53.53]Okay, take 500.
[205:59.66]This is going to be the calculator?
[206:01.06]Give... What does this mean?
[206:02.54]Take five... What does this mean?
[206:09.46]Zoom out.
[206:10.10]Oh, fuck.
[206:13.69]What does this take 500 give dice?
[206:25.01]I don't remember this being part of the rules.
[206:28.40]Do I just drag them out?
[206:41.41]I'm a human.
[206:42.11]Player setup.
[206:48.73]How do I add the player?
[206:52.60]Zoom back in.
[206:56.04]No.
[206:56.58]What?
[206:59.68]What do you mean this is too advanced?
[207:01.32]Does anybody else figure this out?
[207:04.00]Whoa.
[207:04.56]What's he doing?
[207:04.98]He's coming out of the fucking ground.
[207:10.13]What?
[207:11.21]Why is it the ghost Monopoly man?
[207:13.15]How do I do that?
[207:13.91]I just want to add the player.
[207:34.66]No sound.
[207:37.16]You rolled and now you can move.
[207:42.73]Three?
[207:45.49]What?
[207:54.11]Anybody know what's going on?
[208:03.72]Why do I get to roll again?
[208:13.17]for the distinctive design of the game board as well as each of the distinctive pieces and elements of the board the pieces in the word monopoly our trademarks are parker brothers division of tonka corporation for its real estate trading game in the game equipment
[208:45.00]Okay.
[208:46.38]I don't want to see any more.
[208:47.44]Alright.
[208:47.88]Now we just have the credits just popping up on the screen forever.
[208:55.14]Now what?
[208:55.50]Wait!
[208:56.04]I think I just added them.
[208:57.84]Human?
[208:58.64]Just make them all.
[208:59.55]Who cares?
[209:00.07]Okay.
[209:00.31]We're going to bet.
[209:02.31]I know what I'm doing.
[209:03.67]I know it.
[209:04.03]Are we ready?
[209:04.47]Watch this.

[209:17.27]How many people can play Monopoly?
[209:23.02]You can't have fucking 10 people play Monopoly.
[210:03.37]Why does he keep waking up out of bed?
[210:05.23]Hold on.
[210:05.49]Is there speed?
[210:07.78]It's got to be speed, right?
[210:18.88]Fast computers.
[210:36.67]Let's go.
[210:50.48]I can't even do a one-minute game?
[210:53.16]Wait, did I just add... I just added players in the middle of Monopoly and made it a one-minute game?
[211:00.14]You can't do that.
[211:10.77]There we go.
[211:11.15]Alright, one minute.
[211:12.73]Who wins?
[211:13.19]There's like 30 pieces on the board.
[211:20.63]It's just like you have the whole family come over.
[211:26.15]Everybody gets to play.
[211:27.49]There's fucking 30 pieces on the board.
[211:29.68]It's like a D&D campaign.
[211:37.49]The game's limit has been reached.
[211:38.55]The player with the highest total assets wins the game.
[211:40.51]Who won?
[211:42.05]Congratulations, dog.

[212:45.90]It's not up to me Holy shit, really?
[212:59.72]You're enabling them
[213:10.23]Lost to a calculator.
[213:17.29]Uh-oh, the Jazz Jackrabbit votes are getting divided.
[213:22.40]Jazz Jackrabbit and Jazz Jackrabbit holiday hair 1995.
[213:25.66]So, um...
[213:32.39]You guys, you gotta come to a consensus here.
[213:35.88]So that's 20, that's 19, 29, 30, that's like 40% want a version of Jazz Jackrabbit.

[214:33.42]That's not how it works.
[214:42.68]So here's what we're going to do.
[214:44.81]Before I turn the stream off, we're going to come back and do a final vote on Jazz Jackrabbit or Jackrabbit holiday here in 1995.
[214:53.77]We'll do it before we leave.
[214:58.84]But it's whatever has the highest score.
[215:01.62]And people want to scroll.
[215:03.50]You should have had the consensus there.
[215:05.54]But it's okay.

[221:58.07]I remember I hated this level.
[221:59.79]This is like the casino level.
[222:00.71]This level sucked.
[222:01.53]This is the one where you could drown, and it was really easy to die in like five seconds.
[222:19.28]It's a good level.
[222:19.92]No, no, wait, am I thinking of the right one?
[222:21.46]Is that the one where you, where you, it's really easy to get trapped and die?
[222:31.74]Real world comic books.
[222:33.14]No, no, I'm thinking of the wrong one.
[222:35.70]No, no, that's chemical plant.

[226:48.20]That's what Yoshi's ass looks like?
[227:01.12]This is not a legal stream, Mario.
[227:03.30]Why can I not do anything?
[227:06.94]I could... Set him up for this one.
[227:19.75]Set him up for this one.
[227:22.43]Oh, fuck.

[228:13.70]He thinks he's won.
[228:15.54]His brain is not even remotely as mutated as mine.

[231:16.66]That's terrifying.
[231:20.78]It's gonna have to come out sooner or later.
[231:25.10]I got it.
[231:27.35]It's your turn.
[231:30.81]Mario, Mario, Mario.
[231:32.99]What have you done?
[231:35.15]What have you done?
[231:35.89]It's my turn now.
[231:50.11]Let me think... Mamma mia... Congratz my turn now!
[232:20.82]Level up!
[232:30.94]Wait, we could've done- we could've had it for free?
[232:34.57]I'm just like clicking random squares, I'm gonna be real.
[232:39.11]But it's alright, I got a Giga Yoshi.
[232:44.09]Okie dokie, your move!
[232:52.12]It's my turn now!
[232:54.50]What's wrong with that Yoshi?
[233:10.48]I just don't- I like- I was making stupid moves in the beginning for like laugh out loud comedy moments and then I couldn't salvage it so I just figured, oh who cares.
[233:26.51]I can still win.
[233:36.29]The good old- Wait, I turned into Bowser!
[233:39.65]I wanna see what Bowser could do too.
[233:47.66]I fucked her- I fucked off too much in the first 10 minutes.
[234:01.97]You can't go there.
[234:03.21]I can't go backwards.
[234:04.57]I just lose.
[234:09.39]I'm going to do it again.
[234:10.51]Hold on.
[234:11.29]I don't want to fuck around this time, though.
[234:12.67]I'm going to show you that I'm not stupid.
[234:23.90]Great.
[234:24.72]I'm alive.
[234:26.16]Go fish?
[234:27.97]I'm gonna prove that I'm not- I'm gonna play Go Fish.
[234:29.71]I'm not gonna- I'm gonna win this round.

[234:57.97]It's supposed to be like a five-year-old.
[235:10.46]Wait, what are the rules for Go Fish?
[235:13.40]In Go Fish, you and Mario will try to make as many books of whatever kind as you can.
[235:19.90]I don't remember how to play Go Fish.
[235:21.28]I haven't played it in like 30 years.
[235:23.44]which you dealt seven cards which appear along the bottom of the screen to ask Mario for a particular card.
[235:28.37]Click on a card.
[235:28.99]I haven't played in a long time.

[239:26.75]I could complete a book here.
[239:30.59]I can get it, though.
[239:34.15]No, he's gonna ask for it!
[239:35.45]No, I don't want him to go fish.
[239:41.63]He's gonna complete another deck.
[239:44.35]Come on, you get me- you had to have just got one.
[239:55.60]You got three of them, don't you?
[239:56.99]Check this out.
[239:57.53]Hey Mario, you got any Yoshis in there?
[240:23.72]Ooh, I'll be getting one right now.
[240:28.96]Oh!
[240:29.32]That's another book for you.
[240:30.90]Oh, I would just start punching the table.
[240:34.66]I'd like to have your piranha plant.
[240:39.30]Mario, go fish.

[240:49.36]Oh, and guess what?
[240:50.74]Hey, the Yoshi you just took out of the deck, I'll take it.
[240:55.78]Oh, would you like it?
[240:56.86]I love it.
[240:57.54]I love seeing it.
[240:58.58]Mario, I don't think you can beat me.
[241:03.97]I get a Bowser from here.
[241:12.18]I get five books.
[241:20.38]Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[241:22.32]Mario's going easy on you because you're playing as a five-year-old.
[241:24.56]Amma really enjoy playing with you.
[241:26.74]Oh, fuck, he really is.
[241:27.64]It's your turn.
[241:29.19]He's complimenting me after every single card he takes.
[241:34.29]He's saying really nice things about me.
[241:35.81]He's letting me take his cards.
[241:39.49]Shit.
[241:41.63]Oh, no!
[241:43.46]Amma got three cards.
[241:46.84]And I'm so excited about it.
[241:48.04]Somebody would be mad about this, but he's like, oh no!
[241:53.22]We know, I love you!
[241:54.30]You are the best!
[241:56.56]You're so smart at this game!
[241:58.52]Oh, good!
[242:09.34]I'm cleaning him out.
[242:10.08]Hey, you got any booze?
[242:12.14]He's not even trying anymore.
[242:12.80]He's playing with an actual four-year-old.
[242:14.50]You can't beat a four-year-old in any game.
[242:36.24]You're a bad person if you do.
[242:40.50]Anybody under the age of eight, if you do any activity, you have to let them win.
[242:49.10]Otherwise, you are a bad person.
[242:52.73]If you play, like, let's say, for instance, like, Connect Four with, like, a five-year-old, and you win, and you're like, yeah, I won!
[243:01.71]You still want to play?
[243:04.39]Hold on, Mario.
[243:05.45]Relax.
[243:05.91]Give me some time.
[243:08.16]Go fish?
[243:15.32]Somebody's three.
[243:16.62]I'm looking for big boos.
[243:20.82]But now he... Do you have any Rexes?
[243:24.33]Mario, go fish.
[243:27.25]I guess I'm gonna go fishing.
[243:31.55]That's my favorite card, I love Mario He just got them

[243:58.98]Yes, I have one card.
[244:01.21]I'm beating it by so much.
[244:04.05]It has to be intentional.
[244:07.63]I'm really enjoy playing with you.
[244:09.71]It's your turn.
[244:14.65]That's so funny.
[244:20.39]When are you getting these cards?
[244:23.76]Mario, I haven't... I haven't had Rexes in like seven turns.
[244:29.82]Change the age in the options menu?
[244:32.83]Shut up.
[244:34.17]That's not real.
[244:37.55]I thought that just said change age for a second.
[244:39.55]I was like, there's no fucking way.

[245:17.36]I'd like to have your Mario's fine Please give me your big booze.
[245:25.19]Oh
[245:33.43]Um... This is actually the kind of scenario where, like... He's being held hostage.
[245:45.56]And he is trying to communicate with me somehow.
[245:47.76]This is like the... The type of shit... Look at him!
[245:52.49]I'm really enjoying playing with you.
[245:53.97]Oh, you're so smart.

[246:32.62]He starts like winching his face and like, Mario think you fantastic, wink over here.
[246:38.58]Under the table, there's a gun pointing at me.
[246:45.45]Yes, I'ma have two cards.

[246:52.03]Oh, you're so good.
[246:55.21]It's your turn.
[246:57.09]He's asking for Bowser's the whole time.

[247:05.08]That's another book for you.

[247:46.86]Help me.
[247:47.40]I did it.
[247:48.40]I told you guys I was going to win.
[248:16.20]No, bye Mario.
[248:18.26]What?
[248:20.80]And here's the thing.
[248:21.46]I don't know how to play any of the rest of these games.
[248:25.76]I only know about dominoes is you set them up for like six hours and you knock them down and they do a cool thing.
[248:31.49]They spin around around your sofa and like over your fridge and stuff.
[248:36.45]I don't know how to play this.
[248:38.52]Like the actual game dominoes.
[248:40.20]I don't know.
[248:42.12]Backgammon is... Again, I have no idea.
[248:46.50]And yacht is an expensive boat for rich people.
[248:50.04]I don't know what that means.
[248:50.78]I'll try it.
[248:52.40]You guys have to help me here.
[248:57.23]That is what this is.
[248:58.11]Okay.
[249:00.05]Mario, you are fucking enormous.
[249:02.53]Why are you like 80 feet tall?
[249:05.05]He's huge.
[249:08.08]I don't know what this means.
[249:17.76]Oh, is it just like poker?
[249:19.70]Like dice poker?
[249:23.62]You got a full house.
[249:24.30]I've never played one game of Yahtzee.
[249:36.38]All I know is I see people play Yahtzee in TV and they just shake the thing around.
[249:40.69]They go, Yahtzee!
[249:41.33]And they high five.
[249:41.75]I don't know what they're doing.
[249:42.51]Alright, so we need... Let's see.
[249:48.49]One, two.
[249:48.83]We could get a full house.
[249:51.91]Choices?
[249:52.57]Sixes?
[249:55.81]Hold on a minute here.
[249:56.59]What is going on?
[250:02.32]Just re-roll.
[250:02.96]Yeah, just re-roll the one, right?
[250:07.26]Because I could get a full house.
[250:10.21]Does that mean I'm holding them?
[250:11.13]Does that mean I'm rolling them?
[250:16.47]Click to hold.
[250:17.11]Okay.
[250:18.55]So roll.
[250:23.57]Oh.
[250:26.25]I can try it again.
[250:38.43]Your turn.
[250:45.06]Hello?
[250:46.76]Oh, wait.
[250:47.24]Four's... Choice?
[250:51.40]Way to go!
[250:52.56]What is choice?
[250:53.22]It's my turn now!
[250:58.66]Oh, you have to pick something, okay.
[251:00.44]I got it!
[251:01.57]The three threes, come on!
[251:04.25]Yeah, Mario's got extra dice up his, uh, clubs.
[251:09.85]I'm gonna roll these ones again!
[251:12.08]He's gonna get five of a kind.
[251:17.82]Hmm... Mario's gonna put these on the... Deuces line.
[251:24.70]That's not that much.
[251:25.38]Your roll.
[251:27.25]This stream always devolves into some form of gambling.
[251:31.79]We're not betting any money here.
[251:33.03]I'm playing... a children's dice game with a made-up kids cartoon character.
[251:38.07]That was just gambling.
[251:42.52]Mario is not real?
[251:43.32]Alright, so we're going to go with the... I'm going to try to get five of a kind.
[251:48.79]Wait, can I do a straight?
[251:49.85]1, 2, 3, 4... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[251:53.23]I could get a big straight, small straight.
[251:54.91]Let's go with 1, 3, 4... I just need a 2, right?
[252:00.62]I'm going to roll for the 2.
[252:03.10]Because that would be a small straight?
[252:06.02]A big straight is the whole thing.
[252:13.49]Fuck it dude.
[252:14.95]No, that's good.
[252:16.01]Let's go.
[252:16.27]Let's go for two How's that a small straight that's one oh shit I just need a five One two three four five.
[252:38.10]I still have the small straight.
[252:39.20]Oh
[252:46.85]It's alright.
[252:51.06]It's alright.
[252:54.70]What is an uh-oh?
[252:59.24]This game's fun.
[253:00.48]I've never played it before.
[253:01.12]This is cool.
[253:01.92]I like this.
[253:02.64]I'm gonna play this tomorrow.
[253:03.46]What do you mean, no it's not?
[253:14.74]Uh-oh.
[253:16.50]So if you get a full house, you can't do it again.
[253:21.22]Is the goal to get every single thing?
[253:24.17]Or just points?
[253:29.19]Oh, that's gonna go on the aces!
[253:35.76]Yeah, most points I got.
[253:39.51]All right, bingo.
[253:39.95]We got two.
[253:40.49]We got one, two.
[253:42.80]We got twos.
[253:43.66]Let's just try to get some twos here.
[253:46.42]We could do one, two, three, four, five, six.
[253:50.48]No.
[254:02.39]There it is.
[254:07.15]What do you mean, sixes, fives, threes, deuces?
[254:13.59]Sixes?
[254:14.37]There's only one six.
[254:17.39]I don't... You just get six points, okay.
[254:27.70]Well, I'm kicking the shit out of him, so I'm alright.
[254:36.05]Hmm...
[254:38.75]Fives?
[254:40.65]Don't get five.
[254:41.51]Don't get any more.
[254:43.98]Yes.
[254:49.68]Stop hurting Mario.
[254:51.66]I didn't do anything.
[254:58.09]That's pretty good.
[254:59.01]That's a pretty good chance for a full house.
[255:03.05]I don't have it yet, so come on.
[255:04.53]Give me a five or a six.
[255:11.41]Mmm, it's not a five or a six.
[255:28.08]I wanted to get the five guy.
[255:29.40]Where is it?
[255:33.36]Aces.
[255:36.82]You want me to do aces?
[255:41.35]No, no, no, ones don't matter.
[255:44.33]Yes, yes, do it.
[255:45.41]Minimize loss.
[255:47.24]Minimize loss.
[255:48.32]Ace is max at six points.
[255:50.90]Save fives.
[255:53.02]I don't, I don't, I, I, I, I, what do I spell?
[255:55.86]That's the first time I've ever played this game.
[255:58.10]Just tell, just help me.
[256:06.83]It's such a simple, I've never seen it before.
[256:11.65]I know you make, like, cards, like... Stop yelling at me!
[256:20.59]Save bigger scoring categories.
[256:22.45]Yeah, that's true.
[256:23.73]I'm gonna win, don't worry.
[256:28.98]Small straight.
[256:30.82]Okay, that's my chance.
[256:32.78]How do you get a... What's a yacht?
[256:36.16]Yahtzee.
[256:37.44]Yahtzee.
[256:39.58]I get it now.
[256:41.36]Alright.
[256:42.46]Here we go.
[256:44.28]So, the, uh... It's five of a kind.
[256:50.14]Do I go for the full house here?
[256:55.22]That's not going to be enough points, though.
[256:56.29]That won't be a lot of points.
[257:00.27]Does it... It depends on... Because it matters to the denomination.
[257:07.07]Yeah, that would be a waste.
[257:13.35]Alright, there we go.
[257:14.17]Well, there's the full house right there.
[257:15.53]God damn it.
[257:17.54]Should I just save the threes and try to go for more threes?
[257:21.74]Or should I just keep this as a full house?
[257:26.36]Because, ah.
[257:29.46]Because, what, ah.
[257:30.76]That's not, alright, I'm gonna take the full house.
[257:32.64]That's a good move.
[257:34.80]It's my turn now.
[257:40.00]That's a poor man's full house.
[257:41.42]Well, it might be the only one I get.
[257:45.88]Is he going for sixes?
[257:49.02]Oh no, this is bad.
[257:49.79]Do not get a full six, Yahtzee.
[257:51.89]Oh, thank god.
[257:52.65]What, how much money points?
[257:53.75]18 points for three sixes!
[257:58.57]Oh my god, okay.
[258:14.84]Okay, we can do fives.
[258:18.45]There's also one, two, three.
[258:21.31]One, two, three, four, five.
[258:26.85]What's a big straight?
[258:33.49]All of them?
[258:36.57]One, two, three, four, five.
[258:47.28]Oh, boy.
[258:48.58]Come on.
[258:51.78]Give me a four.
[259:10.25]Okay.
[259:14.75]I could have had it.
[259:16.35]It's not that hard.
[259:17.85]It's not a bad chance.
[259:20.53]He's going for the ones.
[259:29.04]What?
[259:29.30]Oh no.
[259:29.76]He's going for a four or five of a kind.
[259:32.16]He really wants those big sixes.
[259:35.66]Oh my god!
[259:36.52]Game sucks!
[259:39.10]How many points is that?
[259:40.94]Fifty!
[259:45.03]Oh, I'm never gonna win now.
[259:46.55]That's like the best thing you could possibly get in the whole game.
[259:49.33]There's no way I'm gonna win.
[259:55.69]It was all sixes.
[260:01.14]I just feel defeated now.
[260:06.80]Lost to Mario.
[260:08.44]I just beat him, though.
[260:09.46]Whatever.
[260:11.07]I guess I could go for... It doesn't matter.
[260:15.08]It's just like being at the blackjack table and a guy next to you does like a $500 hand and he gets blackjack.
[260:20.28]And you've lost the last five hands in a row and you lose again.
[260:24.35]And he's like, yeah, oh my god, blackjack!
[260:26.17]And you're sitting there like, okay.
[260:30.37]Fun games we're having here.
[260:31.57]Fun, having a fun time.
[260:32.95]Here we go.
[260:38.74]This could put me back in.
[260:42.76]Two, three, four, five, six.
[260:45.20]Give me a two.
[260:55.17]Do I try to beat him in his own game and do sixes and fucking throw the dice in the air?
[261:07.18]Sometimes you gotta do a Hail Mary play.
[261:16.87]It's your turn.
[261:18.09]Ah, fours.
[261:23.57]It's a one in six chance and I've done it like three times.
[261:25.98]I can't win.
[261:31.12]Okay.
[261:35.06]Oh, I got it.
[261:37.86]Oh, sixes.
[261:40.37]And I was going first three.
[261:41.11]I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[261:43.67]One in six is unlikely.
[261:45.37]No, I wouldn't say that.
[261:50.42]He's gonna do another... What is he looking for here?
[261:53.76]Just straight?
[261:56.46]No, he didn't get it.
[262:01.76]Okay.
[262:02.62]I'm sorry.
[262:12.51]I already did the full house, so fives, I guess?
[262:15.37]Try to go for five?
[262:21.37]Five, five, five, give it to me.
[262:24.19]One, two, one, two.
[262:27.33]One, two, three, four, five.
[262:31.25]No, five, four, three.
[262:33.63]No, I can't.
[262:38.13]No.
[262:38.47]No!
[262:51.92]Can I just not click any of them?
[262:58.54]Do I have to click fives?
[263:01.23]Or can I just say pass?
[263:06.43]I don't think I can win this at all.
[263:13.91]Look at this.
[263:16.79]This is bullshit.
[263:17.77]He's gonna get a big straight here.
[263:21.64]Oh my god, what the hell is this?
[263:23.80]I don't think there's a reason for me to play right now.
[263:30.45]Unless I get a big straight and sixes.
[263:34.87]One, two, three, four, five.
[263:51.56]Should I just hold the sixes and just fucking go for it?
[263:54.48]Who cares?
[263:58.13]Go for the straight.
[264:00.81]Six, five, four, three, two... Two, three, four, five, six.
[264:09.03]Just need a four.
[264:09.63]He's back in the game.
[264:20.41]Back in it.
[264:22.07]Let's go, Mario.
[264:26.43]All I need- I just need good sixes, and I gotta go to- I gotta go to Yahtzee.
[264:36.44]Don't- No one.
[264:38.62]Good.
[264:39.44]Oh, wait!
[264:39.92]No, shit!
[264:40.35]Oh, no, he didn't-
[264:49.43]There's no way I can win.
[264:51.15]Is there a surrender?
[264:54.94]When can I go... Well played.
[264:58.68]And then blow my character's portrait up.
[265:25.38]Oh, you're so good.
[265:26.56]I gotta get four of a kind.
[265:36.03]He's going for four of a kind right here.
[265:39.35]You better not get it.
[265:39.97]He's not gonna get it.
[265:42.73]Don't give it to him.
[265:43.97]If he gets this, I lose.
[265:45.01]No matter what.
[265:48.45]Oh, you fucking stupid game.
[265:50.49]That's going on the four of the kind line.
[266:00.92]I'm gonna do it again.
[266:03.34]That's a great game.
[266:06.42]Well played.
[266:10.93]Riku.
[266:11.43]I'm gonna go first.
[266:14.25]Do it.
[266:34.96]Mario's gonna put this on a D. All of the kind line.
[266:45.09]Okie dokie, your move.
[266:47.69]Wait, it's not over yet.
[266:53.27]Ooh, we can do a big full house here.
[266:57.17]Or I could go for the fives.
[267:00.74]No full house, but I'd go for the fives.
[267:04.69]Fives, baby.
[267:05.55]Five.
[267:08.26]Oh.
[267:13.10]Throw it right back in his face.
[267:14.06]Five.
[267:16.42]Ah.
[267:20.17]No, fives.
[267:20.89]Fives.
[267:21.51]Fives.
[267:21.99]Not four of a kind.
[267:22.79]I'll get that with some of the little shitty ones.
[267:26.43]Take the four of a kind.
[267:27.57]But should I take the... I should take the fives, right?
[267:31.19]Four of a kind?
[267:31.95]But what if I... But should I...
[267:36.26]How is 4 of a Kind 22?
[267:39.08]And why is 4 of the 5s 20?
[267:41.32]I don't know.
[267:43.80]I'm not an expert on this.
[267:46.52]It's just more points.
[267:47.78]But what if I get a better... 4 of a Kind is harder to do.
[267:54.64]Alright, I'm going to listen to the... I'm going to ask the audience, you know?
[268:03.71]This is a game.
[268:06.53]That's a shit-full house.
[268:07.73]I hope you get it.
[268:17.25]Yeah, you lose.
[268:22.30]Alright, let's go.
[268:24.98]Something big.
[268:28.64]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[268:31.66]Two, three, four, five, six.
[268:37.26]Give me a 5.
[268:56.94]Don't hold the 6.
[268:57.84]Why not?
[268:58.12]2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[269:10.24]Two, three, four, five, six.
[269:16.92]Five.
[269:33.50]Okay.
[269:37.03]Don't take the one to the sixth chance, but that's how you gotta... You gotta big bet, and you gotta do big bet every time.
[269:49.16]You're killing me here.
[269:49.82]Don't do this.
[269:50.70]Don't do the same thing that I do.
[269:52.00]Mario's doing it.
[269:52.76]See?
[269:54.92]Mario's doing it.
[269:55.78]I'm gonna put this on the little straight line.
[270:01.12]Okie dokie.
[270:02.18]Your move.
[270:07.17]If it was such a bad odds, Mario wouldn't be doing it.
[270:09.49]Ooh, bingo.
[270:16.62]Take the aces here.
[270:24.62]Come on.
[270:25.82]Give me the aces.
[270:32.16]I'm a really enjoy playing with you.
[270:35.36]It's my turn now.
[270:40.46]That's not bad, though.
[270:42.24]Let's see.
[270:44.28]No, no, no, no.
[270:46.79]I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[270:49.07]It's not gonna happen.
[270:55.91]He's not gonna happen.
[270:56.65]He's gonna take the sixes here.
[270:59.31]The RRA is four of a kind.
[271:01.57]Good.
[271:01.87]That's a full house.
[271:02.49]That's going on the full house line.
[271:05.75]Thank god these were ones.
[271:06.97]Uh, do I just take the small straight or do I try to get something better?
[271:19.39]Do I just say, I'm done?
[271:35.13]Take the big straight.
[271:36.38]Two, three, four, five, six, or a one.
[271:44.88]Come on.
[271:46.92]I have a much higher chance here.
[271:57.26]There it is.
[271:59.00]Get out of town.
[272:00.43]I'm a really enjoy playing with you.
[272:05.10]Still losing.
[272:08.78]He's going for the... going for the straight.
[272:13.42]Going for a big straight!
[272:14.86]Oh, you're brave.
[272:20.19]He's gonna get it.
[272:21.01]He's gonna get it.
[272:21.43]It's gonna be six.
[272:23.39]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[272:24.37]Mario... I need a big Yahtzee.
[272:32.58]I need a big... I need a Yahtzee.
[272:34.92]Or I need a really... I don't know.
[272:38.08]I gotta get some sixes.
[272:39.22]Ah, well, we're going for the fours.
[272:49.62]Come on.
[272:50.98]Don't make me take 12 points for fours.
[272:54.70]Thank you.
[272:55.62]Thank you.
[272:56.06]You listened for at least a second.
[272:58.38]Oh, you're so good.
[272:59.60]It's my turn now.
[273:03.68]Mario owns the casino.
[273:04.72]You can't beat him in his own casino.
[273:08.00]Mario, savage casino owner that just is savage against everybody.
[273:21.57]The brutal casino owner.
[273:32.31]Who's brutal against everybody.
[273:34.15]I'm just saying the same thing twice in a different way.
[273:35.99]I think I'm just going to take this.
[273:47.88]Hold on.
[273:48.34]We got an opportunity here for two, three, four, five.
[273:54.24]Doesn't matter though.
[273:55.14]I'm just going to take it.
[273:58.58]Oh, you're so good.
[273:59.80]It's my turn now.
[274:04.13]I need a Yahtzee.
[274:07.65]I got it.
[274:09.03]Oh, I always get the sixes and then reroll them.
[274:11.79]I get them every time.
[274:12.99]Fuck you.
[274:21.96]Let's see.
[274:24.40]Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line.
[274:28.48]Oh, Mario, you special magnetic weighted dice.
[274:32.30]Ho, ho.
[274:45.09]I already took the... I have to do fives.
[274:49.47]Or go for a full house.
[274:53.87]This is a terrible full house, though.
[274:55.47]A one and a two full house?
[274:59.28]That's so bad.
[275:00.18]I'm just going to go for the five.
[275:05.02]That's embarrassing if I try to take that.
[275:06.88]I'm just re-rolling fives.
[275:17.89]Now I got the fours.
[275:18.93]I already did the fours.
[275:26.43]Choice?
[275:27.54]His choice is only 19.
[275:30.30]Full house with a... I don't think it's gonna happen.
[275:39.43]I'm depressed.
[275:40.03]I need a five.
[275:44.45]If I get a four, this whole thing fucks up.
[275:48.46]Knocky knocky.
[275:49.65]Hey, alright.
[275:50.37]Who's there?
[275:51.89]Pizza.
[275:53.09]Pizza who?
[275:53.67]Pizza who?
[275:55.53]Pizza the heck out of me.
[275:56.97]If I had a drink, I would throw it in your face.
[276:12.20]I have to take choice here.
[276:17.46]Okay.
[276:18.68]That's still winnable.
[276:23.03]It's not bad.
[276:27.09]God damn it.
[276:28.53]This is what he needs, too.
[276:32.41]He always gets what he needs.
[276:38.28]I'm so lucky.
[276:39.26]Yay.
[276:40.08]Oh, God.
[276:41.84]I think this is over.
[276:42.74]That's going on the fives line.
[276:45.36]This only is possible if I get a big Yahtzee.
[276:56.36]That is not a big Yahtzee.
[276:57.69]That is a bad Threes.
[277:04.55]I don't want to... I'm not taking that Full House.
[277:08.29]No.
[277:09.39]That's so bad.
[277:14.09]One and three?
[277:16.55]Alright.
[277:17.63]Alright, I got it!
[277:19.10]I got it, I did it!
[277:20.54]I'll take it.
[277:21.16]Should I take it?
[277:21.88]Yes.
[277:22.64]Ah, yeah.
[277:24.40]Thank you.
[277:25.76]I'm really enjoy playing with you.
[277:28.16]But I'm just behind still.
[277:34.18]Let's see.
[277:34.66]What does he got here?
[277:36.81]He's looking for his aces.
[277:38.05]I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[277:47.50]Okay.
[277:50.06]It's gonna be a low score no matter what it is.
[277:53.58]Three.
[277:54.72]It's alright.
[277:59.66]Yeah, he doesn't have very many opportunities for points.
[278:02.18]He really has to get fours or threes.
[278:03.92]I can win this.
[278:05.28]I just need a good sixes round.
[278:07.66]I can win.
[278:09.74]And that's how you get it.
[278:11.26]This is how it starts.
[278:12.28]This is how I win.
[278:14.24]We are going straight up sixes, and I need at least four of them.
[278:18.94]Three or four of them.
[278:26.37]It's not... Come on.
[278:28.31]Don't make me choose this.
[278:29.81]You gotta give me at least three.
[278:42.47]This is a winnable game now.
[278:43.57]It's my turn now.
[278:49.01]I got a real chance here.
[278:50.79]He just has to get some bad rolls.
[278:53.45]No, it's fine.
[278:53.99]He already took his sixes.
[278:54.87]All right, just give him one.
[278:57.77]Only one.
[278:58.37]No fours.
[279:00.01]No fours.
[279:00.53]He's gonna get screwed here.
[279:01.25]Come on.
[279:02.01]No fours.
[279:03.35]And I win the game.
[279:05.29]No fours.
[279:05.91]No fours.
[279:06.47]Oh, that's fine.
[279:07.01]That's going on the fours line.
[279:11.45]It's your turn.
[279:12.67]It's gonna be close.
[279:31.44]Five, but I feel like I don't want to do the fives until I get at least two.
[279:37.00]I could try again.
[279:39.49]No, I'm doing three.
[279:41.23]Because I want to get... I'm going to do three.
[279:43.75]I'm going to do three.
[279:44.73]I'm going for three.
[279:50.55]Oh, god damn it!
[279:51.89]It's okay.
[279:52.91]Oh!
[279:53.13]No, I can still do this!
[279:56.04]No, I don't know what to do.
[279:59.70]Should I hold five now that I have two?
[280:04.66]I'll stay with the threes because... But it could be another five.
[280:09.78]This is crucial to win the game.
[280:12.62]Absolutely crucial.
[280:13.78]I hope I don't regret this.
[280:19.76]I hope I don't regret this.
[280:21.17]If this rolls a five, a couple fives, I'll be so upset.
[280:43.49]Select the line to score.
[280:46.47]Okay.
[280:48.99]I just need... I need... I got it.
[280:54.38]Okay, he's gonna do... What is he going for?
[280:56.62]A Yahtzee?
[280:57.04]You're not gonna hold the three?
[281:01.80]Good, give him a Yahtzee with ones.
[281:07.99]Let's see.
[281:09.35]What is he gonna do?
[281:10.39]Mario's gonna put this on the trees.
[281:13.90]Oh, you just... Wow, zero points.
[281:16.30]Okie dokie.
[281:17.06]Your move.
[281:18.02]That's it.
[281:18.56]This is gonna be game over.
[281:20.36]I just need fives.
[281:21.64]Anything.
[281:24.72]None of those are fives.
[281:26.15]Throw the whole fucking thing away.
[281:28.53]Fives.
[281:35.49]What are you doing to me?
[281:36.99]I just... Give me a five.
[281:40.25]Just give me one five.
[281:51.32]Oh, I got one.
[281:52.38]I got one.
[281:54.52]One five.
[281:55.66]I win.
[281:56.60]Okay.
[281:58.28]It's my turn now.
[282:10.42]He's doing the ones again.
[282:11.32]I win.
[282:15.82]I win.
[282:16.44]He's not going to get anything.
[282:21.11]I win.
[282:22.03]I win.
[282:24.01]I won by two points.
[282:25.75]Thank you.
[282:26.25]Good game.
[282:27.73]That was intense.
[282:29.13]That was fun.
[282:31.47]I love this game.
[282:32.61]I'm going to play this at my family reunions.
[282:36.75]Uh, we're going for... I mean, it's... I might as well just grab the five.
[282:40.83]Imagine if I didn't get one five that last time.
[282:53.93]I win.
[283:09.12]I mean, I kind of have to do best two out of three.
[283:19.41]This game's fun.
[283:27.97]God, I have to settle the tie.
[283:29.41]I have to settle the tie.
[283:30.57]I'm sorry, guys.
[283:31.33]I have to settle the tie.
[283:32.05]I'm doing it again.
[283:36.49]Let's go.
[283:37.41]This is for it.
[283:38.01]This is me versus Mario.
[283:39.17]Whoever wins gets to have the new console named after him.
[283:41.95]The Switch 2.
[283:44.43]He won.
[283:44.95]I won.
[283:45.43]Let's go.
[283:52.31]He's playing fast now.
[283:53.49]He's doing it.
[283:53.95]He's pissed.
[283:54.47]What's he gonna go for?
[283:59.93]A freeze?
[284:02.10]Ah, he got a full house.
[284:02.94]It's alright.
[284:03.28]I can beat that.
[284:03.78]It's alright.
[284:05.66]Twos.
[284:05.98]We're going for the twos here.
[284:10.08]We can do one, two, three, four, five.
[284:17.87]We can do one, two, three, four, five.
[284:28.40]Hmm.
[284:30.70]I'm going for it.
[284:31.16]We're going for big plays this time.
[284:40.38]We're going for big plays.
[284:41.46]Big plays.
[284:42.20]Give us a three.
[284:43.18]Big plays.
[284:46.32]The plays sucked.
[284:49.20]I have to do choice.
[284:50.91]18's not bad.
[284:51.75]That's not terrible.
[284:52.43]18's actually pretty good.
[284:57.50]Or I could do the terrible aces.
[285:00.28]Yeah, that's a good... I'll do aces, aces.
[285:02.69]It's all right.
[285:05.85]I fucked myself there.
[285:06.67]It's all right.
[285:07.55]Just focus back at the table.
[285:10.31]Cocktails!
[285:10.99]Cock... Let me get a drink.
[285:11.75]Can I get a vodka pineapple, please?
[285:14.13]Thank you.
[285:15.81]Come on!
[285:25.16]That's going on the aces line.
[285:27.52]You got nothing.
[285:27.90]You got one extra point than I did.
[285:28.82]Who cares?
[285:29.64]Your roll.
[285:38.01]Ooooooooh, didn't have to do anything!
[285:42.67]Didn't have to do it.
[285:43.65]Hold on.
[285:44.11]Yeah!
[285:44.63]I didn't have to do anything!
[285:45.39]30 points.
[285:49.45]That's a good straight to have.
[285:53.16]Oh, brother!
[286:02.39]He's shaking now.
[286:03.15]He's like, oh, 30 points.
[286:10.75]Put the fear in him.
[286:11.77]It's all right.
[286:20.18]It's all right.
[286:21.76]How are you still playing this?
[286:23.52]This is my favorite game.
[286:36.83]Alright, hold on here.
[286:38.27]We could go for the threes.
[286:39.99]Or we could do one, two, three.
[286:41.71]One, two, three, four.
[286:43.89]Or we could do three, four.
[286:45.89]Three, four.
[286:47.35]Hear me out on this one.
[286:48.05]Let's go big plays.
[286:49.19]Three, four.
[286:52.62]Five, six.
[286:53.22]We're going for big plays.
[286:56.68]Small straight, big plays.
[286:57.66]Three, four, five, six.
[287:05.11]Say it later, Mario.
[287:08.46]I'm going for big plays.
[287:13.73]Small straight is just four, right?
[287:16.19]I got a really good chance.
[287:19.27]Big plays.
[287:19.65]Let's go.
[287:23.31]Big plays.
[287:24.39]Big plays.
[287:25.09]I don't even need to roll the other one.
[287:34.49]Oh, no.
[287:36.53]It's my turn now.
[287:43.87]Uh-oh!
[287:52.30]Oh, no!
[287:52.80]He could get a Yahtzee here.
[287:54.62]How much is a... Ace's Yahtzee?
[287:59.26]Okay, that's alright.
[288:01.36]Oh, that's a terrible four of a kind.
[288:04.52]Oh, you lose, Mario.
[288:08.19]You got too greedy.
[288:09.61]Bad play, Mario.
[288:10.85]Bad play.
[288:14.59]Any Yahtzee is 50.
[288:15.69]Bad play, though, with ones?
[288:19.09]I wouldn't have done that.
[288:20.07]What an idiot, you know what I mean?
[288:21.77]I've been playing this a lot.
[288:23.59]Now we go for the threes.
[288:32.50]Mario, you may as well fucking just give up.
[288:43.33]Mario, I mean, like, you may as well just give up.
[288:48.05]Uh-oh.
[288:49.39]Uh-oh.
[288:55.54]Uh-oh's right.
[288:57.10]Uh-oh.
[288:57.22]This is bad.
[288:57.54]He's not gonna get it.
[288:58.24]Let's see.
[289:15.65]That's the second time he's done that.
[289:19.62]That's the second time he's done that.
[289:21.18]That gets hairy here.
[289:29.85]All right, we could do twos.
[289:31.91]Let's try.
[289:32.49]Or we could... Yeah.
[289:34.01]Yeah.
[289:42.11]Come on!
[289:43.19]Give me a few more.
[289:43.98]Make this good.
[289:51.74]It's alright.
[289:53.26]Better than nothing.
[289:53.84]Better than nothing!
[289:55.28]That's a great move!
[289:58.18]It's my turn now!
[289:59.68]Still ahead.
[290:00.68]That four of a kind's gonna kill him.
[290:01.74]Uh oh.
[290:07.50]I'm gonna roll these ones again!
[290:13.50]Come on.
[290:15.30]Not good.
[290:15.94]It's alright.
[290:17.30]Three is not terrible.
[290:18.34]I could get four.
[290:23.44]Oh, no.
[290:24.01]He already did a full house.
[290:27.25]He already did a full house.
[290:28.07]That's a pretty average score.
[290:30.19]Not bad.
[290:38.70]Speaking of full houses, I wonder if this is worth getting.
[290:41.60]Or if I should go for fives.
[290:44.68]I'm an idiot.
[290:45.24]Never mind.
[290:47.00]I thought that was a three.
[290:54.84]Come on.
[290:55.32]I can't just get three in every category.
[291:00.98]Another one.
[291:04.16]Yes!
[291:05.10]Oh!
[291:08.82]Thank you for playing my game.
[291:14.59]That's a, that's a Yahtzee.
[291:19.57]We're almost at the level of unachievable to win.
[291:31.72]Unless he gets one.
[291:32.42]If he gets a Yahtzee, the game still goes.
[291:34.28]It's still good.
[291:36.66]It's still very possible.
[291:39.30]My top three scrolls are the best you can get.
[291:44.77]Didn't you say you were done with this shit?
[291:51.37]I did say that like an hour ago, but it's too fun.
[291:59.03]Give me the sixes.
[292:01.59]Or I could just say get a choice here.
[292:04.44]Take the 23 points.
[292:08.62]I think I'm just going to take the 23 points.
[292:14.08]And just roll the two.
[292:17.48]You know what I'm saying?
[292:22.04]I gotta get a good choice at some point.
[292:24.66]Or roll the sixes.
[292:32.42]Yeah, I could get more sixes, guys.
[292:38.15]Oh, boy!
[292:42.04]Way to go.
[292:44.06]It's my turn now.
[292:50.96]Let's see.
[292:52.98]Reroll the four.
[292:53.98]I got the high from the casino.
[292:56.52]It doesn't matter.
[292:57.02]I win.
[293:01.10]He's not going to win.
[293:06.57]Let's see.
[293:08.95]that's going on the choice line oh boy wow 15 points for a choice yeah oh mario well here's your sixes let's go for it let's put it out of reach
[293:38.62]It's out of reach now.
[293:39.38]And that's a full fucking house.
[293:40.90]Look at that full house.
[293:42.98]You ain't gonna get much better than that.
[293:52.22]In fact, you can't get better than that.
[293:53.87]That's the best full house in the game.
[294:03.17]Oh, your big straight's gonna really help you here.
[294:19.58]I think he's just depressed.
[294:30.09]I think he gave up.
[294:30.95]I think he's just realizing that it's impossible for him to win.
[294:36.12]He took the loss.
[294:39.09]Alright, well, let's go for, um... It's, I mean, the game's over.
[294:45.64]One IQ Mario.
[294:47.12]Look at that, look at him.
[294:49.36]If that, look at that face.
[294:51.34]He is so fucking angry right now.
[294:55.69]Look at his lips just fucking pushed, crushed together.
[294:58.61]Just, mm-hmm.
[295:00.29]Mm-hmm.
[295:00.89]Look at his hands, his body language.
[295:04.51]Clasping his hands together.
[295:06.35]No, no, Mario, you're fine.
[295:11.76]Uh, I'm gonna go for sixes.
[295:13.25]Just because, like, fuck it, why not?
[295:22.21]Not anymore.
[295:38.70]Whoa!
[295:40.50]Should I just do it?
[295:41.50]Uh-huh.
[295:49.02]Yeah, I'll take it.
[295:50.73]That's a free three sixes.
[295:56.63]Can he, I don't think he can even, he can't win.
[295:58.43]The game's over.
[296:02.03]It's not possible for him to win.
[296:05.18]I mean, I guess if I didn't get anything.
[296:10.14]It might be possible, sort of.
[296:12.38]Something really bad would have to happen.
[296:13.80]Uh, we could go for four of kind.
[296:22.53]But that's not gonna happen.
[296:23.45]We need to go for fours.
[296:35.45]Oh, goddammit.
[296:36.75]Now I gotta go for fives.
[296:49.94]I could just take the four.
[296:50.92]I could take the four.
[296:52.82]No Yahtzee and I win.
[297:04.02]He ain't gonna get it.
[297:14.94]I would have beat him with the five.
[297:16.02]Oh, because the points, right.
[297:18.54]It's alright.
[297:18.90]For him to get a Yahtzee right now would be... That's literally getting struck by lightning.
[297:27.37]That's getting struck by lightning while you're scratching a lottery ticket and you win.
[297:30.95]He's not going to get it.
[297:33.25]Fives or four of a kind.
[297:39.71]I could go for the...
[297:49.76]I win.
[297:51.81]See you later.
[297:52.19]Mario, that's over.
[297:55.31]That's it.
[297:56.71]I win.
[297:57.23]I won the World Series.
[297:59.07]I won Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
[298:02.36]I win.
[298:04.52]Mario and Sonic at the casino.
[298:08.26]Oh, brother.
[298:15.29]I got it.
[298:20.67]Even if you get a Yahtzee here, Mario.
[298:25.17]That's it.
[298:30.77]Yeah, he'd be at 201.
[298:31.59]Mario was really fun.
[298:32.51]But I win.
[298:42.87]See if I can go over a certain amount of points here.
[298:47.11]Oh, damn.
[298:49.31]I mean, you gotta go for the four of kind sixes just to rub it in his face, right? 240.
[299:14.16]Why does Yoshi look so angry?
[299:15.88]Hey, how about another game with me?
[299:18.20]No.
[299:19.10]Best 3 out of 5.
[299:20.70]Best 5 out of 3.
[299:22.14]No, sorry.
[299:22.76]That's it.
[299:28.36]Best 5 out of 7.
[299:29.23]3.
[299:29.43]I just won 3.
[299:31.35]No, 3.
[299:31.57]Yeah, that would be 3 out of 5.
[299:35.09]5 out of 3.
[299:36.59]Mario need a Snickers.
[299:39.81]He hungry.
[299:41.43]Don't do math very well.
[299:47.56]Well, that's that one.
[299:50.30]Does he have clickable things on him?
[299:52.26]He does.
[299:53.00]Can I stretch his face like in the N64 one?
[299:54.84]Alright, well that was fun.
[299:58.46]That was really cool.
[300:00.02]I'm surprised that this game exists, to be honest.
[300:02.66]Dominoes?
[300:03.19]I don't know anything about Dominoes.
[300:04.37]I can't play Dominoes.
[300:05.23]We'll just look at it.
[300:07.27]This is what I was talking about.
[300:12.71]You just push him over.
[300:22.74]I don't know what any of this means.
[300:23.76]I have no idea.
[300:26.96]Why are we Skype chatting?
[300:28.26]Why am I doing FaceTime with him?
[300:29.46]We can't be in the same room?
[300:35.69]I don't know what any of this means.
[300:37.67]The first doublet?
[300:45.66]Is it...
[300:47.52]I have to match the number, right?
[300:48.80]I think.
[300:49.22]Three?
[300:55.47]I don't know what the goal is, though.
[300:56.85]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[301:00.73]I don't know what's a correct play.
[301:01.99]I don't know what point system.
[301:03.29]I don't even know.
[301:04.63]Match the number, right?
[301:06.55]Match the number.
[301:07.05]Can I do it on my own or do I have to do it on his?
[301:16.40]Why can I not?
[301:16.86]I can't do this.
[301:20.36]What?
[301:21.88]You have to do it on the end.
[301:23.20]Okay.
[301:33.06]What is that?
[301:33.70]Okay.
[301:33.82]Fine.
[301:34.00]I can do that too.
[301:45.20]That's a good move.
[301:46.62]It's my turn now.
[301:48.34]Maybe I should draw from the bone yard.
[301:50.66]Draw from the bone yard?
[301:52.98]What does that mean?
[301:53.84]We have bones?
[301:54.94]We have a bone yard.
[301:57.52]Here's your bone.
[302:02.25]Oh, you're so good.
[302:03.51]It's my turn now.
[302:05.55]Maybe I should draw from the bone yard.
[302:08.09]I got it.
[302:10.37]He just drew like six times.
[302:13.89]Can you draw as many times as you want?
[302:15.33]Uh-oh.
[302:23.13]Maybe I should draw from the boneyard.
[302:25.31]Here's your bone.
[302:32.50]You're such a good player.
[302:36.14]How about this move?
[303:12.33]Quick help He won't tell he's not gonna help me You know
[303:31.74]I never played it before.
[303:33.59]I have no idea.
[303:34.99]I'm going to beat him.
[303:37.05]Watch.
[303:38.65]I'm going to embarrass the fuck out of him.
[303:40.15]I'm a four-year-old just placing tiles, and I'm going to win.
[303:47.01]Watch this.
[304:09.90]Maybe I should draw from the boneyard.
[304:12.66]Maybe you should draw from the boneyard.
[304:14.58]Let's see.
[304:20.02]Dumb.
[304:22.08]What a dumb thing to do.
[304:24.50]No more dominoes in the boneyard.
[304:26.06]You lose, Mario.
[304:27.32]Oh no, you gotta pass.
[304:30.34]I can keep going.
[304:37.59]What do you got?
[304:50.68]Oh, I win, Mario!
[304:55.89]That's it!
[304:57.49]Yeah!
[305:03.57]I had no fucking idea what I was doing, and I still beat him.

[305:52.43]I don't think I can bullshit my way through this one.
[305:59.21]I don't think I can...
[306:02.13]Does anyone know how to play Backgammon?
[306:04.65]I don't think anyone in the chat knows how to play this.
[306:06.55]Looks like a Mario go first.
[306:08.69]Good luck!
[306:15.37]I would be surprised if even 5% of everybody here knows how to play this.
[306:22.15]This is... I seriously, I'm like reading an alien language right now.
[306:27.82]It's your turn.

[307:20.88]My first experience with Yahtzee and it's like, what a fun game.
[307:23.21]Now I know why it's been around for like 185 years.

[323:40.60]other than what's up here.

[324:37.14]Entering Underhalls.
[324:38.86]Let's do this fast, like I see on the YouTube screen.
[324:42.86]I don't know where to go.
[325:26.53]Get the key.
[325:26.99]Yep.
[325:39.22]Let's go!
[325:41.52]A whole four pixels.
[325:42.90]Wait, what did that open?
[325:52.26]Oh, my fingers hurt!
[326:12.14]Well, now your back's going to hurt because you just gave yourself landscaping duty.
[326:20.23]What did that even open?
[326:29.18]I don't get it.
[326:40.15]What did I?
[326:40.64]What the hell?
[326:40.96]What did I?
[326:41.38]What?
[326:42.34]Tell me I'm crazy.

[326:45.36]Oh, literally blind.
[327:25.05]Doom!
[327:25.23]How do you jump?
[327:30.43]Is it jumping in Doom?
[327:41.61]There is no jumping in Doom, you have to go upstairs.
[327:56.50]Fuck.
[327:56.94]How do I get over here?
[328:01.07]It's escape.
[328:02.15]It's not escape.
[328:06.77]You have to run.
[328:07.77]Is there a run?
[328:08.29]Can you run in Doom?
[328:11.57]Where did that guy come from?
[328:12.53]Game sucks.
[328:20.29]Doom's actually like a classic, fantastic, paved the way for every video game game.
[328:24.51]I'm just kidding.
[328:25.09]Don't take that to heart.
[328:26.05]I really don't mean that.
[328:26.83]All right, so.
[328:33.18]Anything else on this page you'd like to see?

[329:52.37]Uh-oh.
[329:57.23]All right, so there it is.
[329:58.03]This doesn't look like it's lined up correctly.
[330:02.16]Hold on.
[330:14.37]OK, this is Nixon, Johnson.
[330:17.75]What am I looking at here?
[330:27.90]This is a notebook?
[330:32.84]Nixon.
[330:34.22]OK.
[330:35.08]I got to get ready.

[331:32.97]We're just going in like Google Earth style.
[331:36.55]And it's aware.
[331:42.83]This is the equivalent of what a computer would look like if a computer threw up.
[331:52.86]Let's go back to reports troop commitments 11 How do I get away from Nixon

[333:22.61]This is just a simulation.
[333:26.25]Raise the taxes by five million percent.
[333:28.75]That's easy.
[333:32.37]Oh, okay, so they're there.
[333:33.21]Now what do I do?
[333:39.47]How do I get out of Nixon's office?
[334:00.62]Alright.
[334:04.97]You just have to do Watergate.
[334:09.65]Okay, that was Vietnam War.
[334:16.37]Let's go.
[334:16.77]Fun time arc 100%.
[334:27.44]Never.
[334:28.18]It never happens.
[334:29.44]Ah, of course, Sex Vixens is gonna get a few clicks.
[334:43.89]Alright, I veto everybody.
[334:47.35]Because, I'm sorry, I want to see what Stunt Driver is, so everyone's getting vetoed for a minute.
[335:02.80]I need to know what this is.
[335:06.53]Is that person talking?
[335:08.23]Course quiz, on course five, what is the piece...
[335:12.77]What is the piece at location D11?
[335:15.11]This is not Stunt Driver, this is... Hello?
[335:34.62]Was that a Captcha?
[335:59.42]On Course 2, page 42, what is the piece at location... In order to run the game, you need to run the file... It's pretty hard to guess.
[336:17.32]I had this game, and as soon as I got the quiz, I remembered it all.
[336:19.96]I believe this is one of the games that got me to save all my boxes with the documents inside.
[336:27.73]Don't click the virus.
[336:29.11]Bibliotheca.
[336:31.17]Bibliotheca.meseo8bits.es I don't know what this is.
[336:41.87]This could be a fucking... This could be a virus.
[336:49.96]It's a virus.
[336:51.20]No, I'm not clicking a virus PDF.
[336:55.70]Go ahead, do it again.
[337:10.35]Bibliotheca.
[337:11.07]It means library.
[337:14.21]I don't know.
[337:14.71]I don't know what that word is.
[337:16.37]It's foreign to me.
[337:17.49]I'm scared.
[337:18.89]It could mean virus.
[337:35.99]This is sick.
[337:36.55]I know.
[337:36.85]I'm just fucking around.
[337:45.58]All bubble votes are now registered as down arrow votes.
[337:49.98]Why?
[337:50.26]Don't worry.
[337:55.71]I'm going to come back and play Stunt Driver before the stream is over.
[337:57.91]We still have to play the Jackrabbit game too.
[338:01.03]Alright, let's go down.
[338:04.80]Because I did veto it, and it was just fun.
[338:08.77]I'll try it.
[338:12.07]Let's scroll down.
[338:13.43]How much do I need to scroll?
[338:18.62]So we need to go like this.
[338:20.52]We're going to get a bunch more.
[338:24.10]Like this.
[338:24.56]OK.
[338:33.58]Hold on, let me just make sure there's no porn game.
[338:36.72]So I can... Okay.
[338:38.56]Don't click this one.
[338:39.56]I'm not clicking on strip poker 2+.
[338:44.26]By the way, it also looks like the cable boxes used to look.
[338:51.08]When you used to go to the porn channel on old TV, it was just scrambled like that.
[339:00.07]Fat Bossiant.
[339:01.79]Thank you, Fat Bossiant, for the $50.
[339:05.88]50 bucks from Fat Bossiant.
[339:09.58]Hey, Jeremiah, I haven't seen a stream since finishing Sekiro, thanks to being a EU pleb.
[339:14.36]I just wanted to know, Bloodborne or Sekiro?
[339:17.77]Bloodborne.
[339:19.17]Every time.
[339:21.93]All right.
[339:22.63]Remember, I'm not clicking this one.
[339:26.64]But thank you for the 50 fucking bucks.
[339:28.76]It's a lot of money.
[339:38.46]I really appreciate that.
[339:39.98]But Bloodborne, I would say every time.
[339:45.26]No, I mean, that's fine.
[339:46.16]You can click it, but your vote doesn't count.
[339:47.76]You're literally just walking into the ballot and just dropping your vote into the trash.
[339:55.22]This is a protest vote.
[340:01.28]That's not a candidate that's on the ballot.
[340:11.46]So it looks like we've got Dangerous Dave and Rogue are in the current running here.
[340:29.12]If we could get softball, we can get strip poker.
[340:31.06]The thing with strip poker is it's probably images on the screen.
[340:38.14]Close.
[340:38.82]I'm going to close it here in about five seconds.
[340:41.00]Five, four, three, two, one.
[340:46.37]Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion.
[340:52.35]Okay.
[340:57.88]Look, if you want to play the sex games, you can go ahead and do them.
[341:02.20]If you're over the age of 18, 25, whatever it is, wherever it's okay for you to accept pornography onto your computer, you got the website.
[341:13.22]I don't need to show, I don't need to play this.
[341:24.05]I want to experience them with you.
[341:25.55]That's weird.
[341:29.83]You want to experience the porn game with me.
[341:33.37]I want you to say that out loud.
[341:35.25]All right, here we go.
[341:42.65]Dangerous Dave.
[341:43.73]All right, we got spaces to go on the title screen to begin.
[341:46.76]Arrow keys to move, controls jump, and alt to fire.
[341:51.88]It's weird.
[341:55.12]Okay, here we go.
[342:05.34]Uh... A soft disk production programming by... By who?
[342:11.28]Go back.
[342:12.90]John Carmack and John Romero!
[342:18.14]Is that a joke or is that real?
[342:29.81]Holy shit.
[342:32.07]I think it's real.
[342:42.57]Let's reload.
[342:45.59]Yeah, this isn't bad for DOS.
[342:46.87]It really isn't.
[342:55.01]I can see this is a Saturday morning Flash game.
[342:59.56]It's Doom 2D.
[343:06.04]Well, that's a cool piece of history there then.
[343:07.98]John Carmack and John Romero.
[343:11.84]When did this release?
[343:12.50]Like, 90?
[343:12.74]I didn't see it.
[343:17.93]Did I even fit an ammo?
[343:22.21]We can aim up, too.
[343:25.97]Oh, I have to jump up it.
[343:26.95]Can I go in the doors?
[343:29.49]Nice.
[343:29.81]I got the secret.
[343:34.47]Can't shoot through walls, though.
[343:42.52]I'm gonna appear right here.
[343:43.30]I gotta shoot this guy around the head.
[343:49.33]It's got- the controls are tight!
[343:51.13]They're pretty good.
[343:53.51]Oh, they can walk downstairs.
[343:54.65]Zombies are smart.
[344:06.36]Stop playing this!
[344:07.24]I wanna play it when the stream ends!
[344:11.57]Can you still do that?
[344:19.90]This game looks sick.
[344:21.32]It's actually very good.
[344:27.66]Can I make this jump?
[344:28.94]I don't think so.
[344:29.40]Ooh, knife!
[344:33.65]I think I have to do that jump.
[344:37.62]Got the egg?
[344:38.06]Alright, hold on, wait, he's gonna throw another one?
[344:39.70]I have to make this jump, huh?
[344:42.58]Damn, alright, let me see if I can get it.
[344:43.77]Oof!
[344:47.45]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[344:51.59]Hmm, can I jump up from here?
[344:54.76]Ooh, no, these are stairs!
[344:56.14]I thought this was a curtain.
[345:14.28]I wonder if there's a boss.
[345:16.72]I kind of want to see what's after the first level.
[345:24.94]Oh, the fucking arrow is there.
[345:26.02]I'm sorry.
[345:34.40]Sorry about that.
[345:43.07]Oh, there was seagulls in the bags of money!
[345:45.17]I didn't get the bags of money.
[345:48.11]I missed the money.
[345:49.23]I thought they were... So it's one hit and you're dead.
[346:00.54]They're not fucking around.
[346:01.38]I only got two more Daves.
[346:08.24]Slimes.
[346:09.81]New enemy type.
[346:14.23]Why can I not shoot up?
[346:16.21]Shoot?
[346:16.97]I can't shoot up?
[346:18.95]Is there a reason why?
[346:21.71]Okay.
[346:22.21]Oh, I... Okay, I can shoot top right, but I can't shoot top left.
[346:29.25]Why?
[346:29.51]Uh... Oh, that's weird.
[346:35.92]I think I'm gonna run out of Daves.
[346:46.08]I'm dead.
[346:46.76]Ah!
[346:50.18]Damn.
[346:52.06]Last one.
[346:59.90]Maybe it's a key binding conflict?
[347:01.28]Eh, maybe.
[347:01.96]Let me go this way.
[347:09.83]R.I.P.
[347:10.27]Dave.
[347:21.56]Go in.
[347:23.38]Oh, fuck.
[347:25.70]Oh, I'm safe.
[347:33.03]Oh, no!
[347:36.61]Anybody, do I have any more quarters?
[347:37.65]I have any more quarters?
[347:41.73]That's good.
[347:42.11]That's really fun.
[347:43.87]I highly recommend it.
[347:44.57]That's called Dangerous Dave, 1991.
[347:50.79]John Carmack, John Romero.
[347:58.27]Cool, that was really cool.
[348:00.45]You could dump lots of time into these.
[348:04.69]So we are still here, right?
[348:10.02]We are, no, what happened?
[348:17.54]Why did I get a, I got a refresh of new stuff?
[348:28.97]No, this is... Was this stuff here before?
[348:35.59]No, this... Why did I come all the way down here?
[348:38.06]That's weird.
[348:42.36]Oh, that's like kind of a spoiler.
[348:44.34]No, this is not right.
[348:45.52]This is like the top of the page here.
[348:52.20]Huh.
[348:53.34]Well... Because this was down... Yeah, I might have to...
[349:02.37]Well, we were here.
[349:03.57]I don't think anything was on here.
[349:04.67]I think this is pretty much everything was on here.
[349:06.13]It's good.
[349:07.39]All right.
[349:08.23]Here you go.
[349:08.69]Click.
[349:10.28]Click on what you'd want to do.
[349:15.18]We're only going to do a couple more of these.
[349:16.58]I think a good stopping point is six to seven hours of this.
[349:25.07]Come back to it again.
[349:33.73]Rogue?
[349:34.51]Didn't we already do Rogue?
[349:42.75]We did another version of Rogue.
[349:55.26]I love this.
[349:56.94]Multitrip gave 10, thank you for the 10 bucks, Multitrip.
[350:02.48]Ten bucks, they say.
[350:03.28]I had a dream that you couldn't get any of these DOS games to work and got really frustrated and just streamed Mordhau instead.
[350:12.30]That feels like it could have been real.
[350:14.50]Very real.
[350:20.84]What a lame dream.
[350:24.18]What do you mean?
[350:25.14]That's cool.
[350:25.48]All right, let's do Rogue.
[350:27.86]Here's the plan.
[350:28.24]All right, listen.
[350:28.58]Here's what we're going to do.
[350:32.05]We're going to play Rogue.
[350:33.91]Then, I'm going to get the Stuntman game to work.
[350:37.89]Then, we're going to do a final vote for Jazz Jackrabbit.
[350:43.91]Then, I'm going to wind the stream down.
[350:48.91]Okay?
[350:50.05]Okay.
[350:51.16]Let's open up Rogue.
[350:52.48]And we're going to do this again.
[350:53.34]Absolutely.
[350:54.24]This is a lot of fun.
[350:56.76]I'm having a great time.
[350:57.84]It's a fucking blast.
[350:58.94]I love seeing all this old weird shit and all these old classic games.
[351:06.54]So let's open up Rogue and give it a try.
[351:07.90]I'm going to have to learn... This one's probably going to be real quick.
[351:16.28]Because I... We're just doing this again.
[351:22.22]Rogue adventure game made possible by public domain by the Codebusters.
[351:26.47]Significant buster contributions by Ricky.
[351:30.75]Thank you, Ricky.
[351:31.21]1984.
[351:32.03]What's the Rogue's name?
[351:45.32]Barney.
[351:50.53]It's a happy face.
[351:52.19]Look at that face.
[351:53.87]You found 45 gold pieces.
[352:03.33]What is this?
[352:04.29]Door?
[352:06.23]Is there like a help?
[352:08.05]Select item to eat.
[352:09.33]Escape to cancel.
[352:11.07]Oh, it's going to do that every time, isn't it?
[352:16.65]D. There's something there already.
[352:19.57]Enter.
[352:20.13]Illegal command.
[352:22.23]Is it like a... F1?
[352:25.87]Oh god.
[352:28.94]Rename something.
[352:29.90]Inventory of your possessions.
[352:31.68]The NE key.
[352:33.12]Supervisor key.
[352:34.18]Enter key.

[353:33.46]E?
[353:33.64]Every time I move, it moves.
[353:40.42]Get away from me!
[353:42.18]Oh shit, it comes S?
[353:49.55]The snake swings and misses you.
[353:57.15]You scored an excellent hit on the snake.
[353:59.77]You defeated the snake.
[354:01.13]The emu scored an excellent hit.
[354:02.91]It's an emu!
[354:05.57]I killed the emu.
[354:06.18]Alright, what is that?
[354:14.90]You have two rations.
[354:18.12]Oh, here comes H. You found 21 gold.
[354:20.89]What do I do about H?
[354:26.39]S-H-E-E-H-S?
[354:31.13]Zap him?
[354:31.77]I don't have zap.
[354:33.39]Which direction?
[354:34.93]You don't have anything appropriate.

[354:39.53]Which direction?
[354:40.79]You don't have anything.
[354:42.13]You swing and miss the hobgoblin.
[354:43.53]The hobgoblin misses you.

[356:21.54]The bat misses you.
[356:22.80]You miss the bat.
[356:23.72]The bat barely misses you.
[356:25.26]You miss the bat.
[356:26.04]I'm just like swinging violently trying to grab it.
[356:29.53]Excellent hit on the bat.
[356:30.57]Bat's dead.
[356:31.99]Emu Wars.
[356:32.75]Okay, the kestrel hit you.
[356:41.91]You don't hit the kestrel.
[356:43.70]You excellently hit the kestrel.
[356:46.54]Gold pieces and a magenta potion.
[356:55.60]How do I use it?
[357:04.96]Q to drink?
[357:07.58]You feel stronger.
[357:08.40]What bulging muscles?
[357:09.92]It makes you bigger.
[357:16.15]Well, I've explored everything.
[357:17.51]Now, how do you go down the stairs?

[357:30.63]You now have scale mail.
[357:31.81]D. B plus one ring mail.
[357:37.17]Scale mail.

[357:39.35]No, pick it up.
[357:44.45]Wear.
[357:45.87]Select item.
[357:46.41]No, that's willed.
[357:50.26]Tab.
[357:52.82]Capital W. You're already wearing some.
[357:55.04]You'll have to take it off first.
[357:59.37]Drop well, drop the T. T?
[358:11.07]Which direction?
[358:15.61]What?
[358:16.69]I threw the mace.
[358:18.23]That's throw.
[358:22.37]Capital T. You used to be wearing a plus one ring armor.
[358:28.99]You aren't wearing any armor.
[358:30.09]OK, now wear the scale mail.
[358:34.25]All right.
[358:35.63]We did it.
[358:38.30]We put it on.
[358:38.96]Uh-oh.

[359:02.18]You don't hit the ice monster.
[359:04.96]You swing and hit the ice monster.
[359:06.14]You've defeated the ice monster.
[359:08.86]What can I do with gold?
[359:09.72]Is there like a shop or something?
[359:16.85]You found 51 gold in an emu.
[359:20.11]Dead in one hit.
[359:22.13]And a slime mold.
[359:27.37]This is a cute little game.
[359:28.33]You now have a scroll titled... Mivfugjugfinkwe
[359:47.59]I don't speak that language, apparently.
[359:49.05]I'm going to have to learn that language at some point.
[359:51.88]Hobgoblin is dead.
[359:53.74]There's a black potion.
[360:01.42]The bat has injured you.
[360:04.92]You don't hit the bat.
[360:05.80]Hit the bat.
[360:18.21]Select item to quaff.
[360:21.45]You can't move.
[360:23.53]You can move again.
[360:27.11]You don't... What's going on?
[360:31.36]It's paralysis.
[360:35.02]Potion of paralysis.
[360:36.22]Now I know what it is.
[360:37.10]Okay, cool.
[360:38.70]Got the gold.
[360:39.52]Let's keep going.
[360:40.08]I mean, I'm just going to go until I lose, you know?
[360:47.02]Why not?
[360:48.94]This is the last one, anyways, before we do the Jackrabbit and the Stuntman.
[360:55.24]That's how Rogue works.
[360:58.34]I like this.
[360:58.76]This is fun.
[361:00.46]It's fun sort of quickly experiencing games I've never even heard of.
[361:03.96]Well, I've heard of this before, but I never really was able to play it.
[361:06.90]I didn't get it.
[361:09.61]Long time ago.
[361:13.77]Nothing even here.
[361:18.27]Oh shit.
[361:20.09]I just opened the door.
[361:20.81]I hit him with the door in the face.
[361:25.93]You're missing the orc.
[361:26.97]The orc misses you.
[361:27.89]You swing and miss.
[361:28.65]The orc swings and misses.
[361:29.91]You score an excellent hit.
[361:35.23]It's dark in here.
[361:35.97]That's cool.
[361:38.39]What is this?
[361:39.72]Potion of Strength.
[361:40.56]Let's go across.
[361:51.74]Pop Goblin.
[361:54.20]Oh, fuck.
[361:54.62]I'm almost dead.
[361:55.72]I gotta be careful.
[361:56.22]I have 4 HP.
[362:00.87]I need a Yagga Drink Potion.
[362:03.25]Potion of Strength.
[362:05.93]D. Oh, no.
[362:09.98]Shit.
[362:14.21]You've injured the Kestrel.
[362:15.29]Where?
[362:16.43]You defeated the Kestrel.
[362:17.43]Where?
[362:17.71]I need to eat food?
[362:20.38]What if I... Oh, eat, eat, eat.
[362:22.24]Cancel.
[362:24.68]Cancel.
[362:25.86]No, I didn't want to drink that.
[362:28.17]I was hitting C for cancel.
[362:30.49]Like an idiot.
[362:32.17]Um... Food?
[362:44.45]What the hell's going on?
[362:50.03]Okay, I've got two rations of food on.
[362:58.42]This food tastes awful.
[363:00.54]Well, it's food.
[363:11.17]It'll keep you going.
[363:12.05]That's all that matters.
[363:17.86]That's the Kestrel.
[363:20.68]Alright, dark.
[363:22.48]Very dark down here.
[363:23.32]Ooh, there's the exit.
[363:25.32]Nice.
[363:28.54]Make sure I see everything, just in case.
[363:32.15]Level 3!
[363:36.29]You don't hit the rattlesnake.
[363:38.69]Where am I?
[363:39.03]Oh, I'm on the bottom left.
[363:45.39]Oh, shit.
[363:46.89]This is not good.
[363:47.77]I need to drink a potion.
[363:51.03]I don't hit the rattlesnake.
[363:51.79]What do I do?
[363:54.33]Oh, boy.
[363:54.59]I'm gonna die.
[363:55.57]What do I do?
[363:56.69]Um... Rest in peace, Barney.
[364:04.18]Killed by a rattlesnake.
[364:05.10]2-16 AU.
[364:05.20]2019.
[364:05.22]Oh, that was... Today, actually.
[364:14.45]He was right in the front door!
[364:16.08]I couldn't go around him.
[364:23.16]That was cool.
[364:25.34]Very, very cool.
[364:30.55]This is- that's one hour from now.
[364:42.56]Okay.
[364:44.78]So that leaves us with, and we're going to do this again, don't worry, we're going to try to leave off right where I did.
[364:49.47]I should be able to.
[364:51.27]Because I was going by, like, views, right?
[364:56.03]Oh, we'll just roll the dice all the time, you know?
[364:58.41]There's all kinds of shit to do.
[365:00.88]Alright, let's get Jackrabbit on the screen.
[365:07.92]Jazz, Jackrabbit, and guys...
[365:12.65]I've got something for you.
[365:14.45]Take a look at the screen right now.
[365:17.17]There are three jazz jackrabbits.
[365:20.67]One, two, three.
[365:24.46]Forget about these.
[365:25.34]Those aren't here.
[365:27.86]This is not here either.
[365:30.08]I literally typed in jazz jackrabbit.
[365:34.39]I typed in jackrabbit.
[365:37.58]So here's how this is going to work.
[365:39.48]If this is a dead vote, this is a dead vote.
[365:44.25]I'm only going to consider these three.
[365:46.49]That's it.
[365:48.69]I'm not going to play a third Oregon Trail.
[365:53.15]There is no scrolling, so just which one of the three Jazz Jackrabbits do you want to see?
[366:03.37]Half of you are just throwing a bowling ball into the pool.
[366:10.65]That's alright.
[366:22.92]Seems like the original Jazz Jackrabbit.
[366:27.68]You're pronouncing Oregon wrong.
[366:29.44]Oregon.
[366:29.96]Oregon.
[366:30.98]Yeah, it's Oregon, but it's the Oregon Trail.
[366:35.00]That's just kind of how that works off my tongue there.
[366:38.99]Oregon Trail?
[366:39.81]The Oregon Trail.
[366:41.71]If you put a the in front of it, it becomes Oregon for me.
[366:44.87]The Oregon Trail.
[366:45.63]No, it's the Oregon Trail.
[366:54.12]Oregon.
[366:54.48]Oregon.
[366:55.10]Oregon.
[366:55.70]Oregon.
[367:04.52]Nevada, Nevada.
[367:06.64]Tomato, tomato, potato, potato.
[367:08.40]It's okay.
[367:12.63]So we are going to do the original Jazz Jackrabbit.
[367:16.49]I've never played it before.
[367:18.43]I'm interested to see how it is.
[367:19.45]And then we're going to do the stunt game, which I will get the password for.
[367:26.07]Maybe I'll just guess.
[367:37.16]Alright, so it's a Ninja Turtle Rabbit.
[367:38.90]That's Raphael.
[367:41.37]Epic Mega Games presents a game by Cliff Blazinski!
[367:47.07]Cliffy B?
[367:48.23]Cliffy B!
[367:53.34]What?!
[367:58.18]Order info.
[367:59.22]Okay, setup options.
[368:02.24]Music volume.
[368:03.04]Turn that down a little.
[368:05.10]Change keys.
[368:05.72]Let's see.
[368:07.10]So it's left cursor, left cursor, right cursor, up.
[368:12.74]Like mouse cursor.
[368:17.21]Jump is alt.
[368:18.75]Fire is space.
[368:21.67]Special is control.
[368:24.77]Okay.
[368:27.19]Where do you have to use the mouse?
[368:32.25]This turtle has kidnapped this rabbit in order to conquer this planet.
[368:36.59]Okay.
[368:40.67]This rabbit to destroy this rabbit, this turtle with this gun to save her and this carrot.
[368:51.52]Welcome to Jazz Jackrabbit.
[368:52.66]Jazz is a speedy, colorful action game unlike any other on the PC.
[368:55.82]In order to play Jazz, you must understand three rules.
[368:58.52]Run like the wind.
[368:59.58]Shoot everything that moves.
[369:00.86]If you can't shoot it, take it.
[369:03.01]If you run into any problems, type HELP ME at the DOS prompt.
[369:07.15]This will bring up full troubleshooting instructions.
[369:10.46]The notorious leader of the turtle, terrorist Devon Schell, has kidnapped the beloved rabbit princess, Eva Erlong, and has inhabited the galaxy with his goons.
[369:18.32]Is all hope lost and away?
[369:20.32]Enter Jazz Jackrabbit, the galactic rabbit.
[369:22.44]Want revenge, and it's your job to extract it.
[369:24.93]You have to save Eva Erlong and prevent Devon Schell from financing his maniacal plot of turtle elimination by swiping the goods out from under his slimy beak.
[369:34.67]This is how you move.
[369:36.80]That's what it is then, okay?
[369:39.76]Jump.
[369:41.11]Blaster, toaster, RF missile launcher, TNT cycle weapon.
[369:44.09]This is cool.
[369:45.23]Collect orbs and orvettes for ammo.
[369:46.93]Alright, I think we get it.
[370:11.95]Oh look, it's sub-badges!
[370:15.40]That's three months, this is six months, this is eight months, and here's a year!
[370:21.50]You get even more angry.
[370:26.29]Ballistic Bunny, Rabbit's Re- Wow, that's creepy.
[370:29.65]Rabbit's Revenge, Gene Machine.
[370:31.79]This is like Bubsy, Sonic, and the Ninja Turtles all had a baby.
[370:39.82]Okay, you can pick any level.
[370:44.84]Let's just look at this Turtle Terror.
[370:49.56]Loading diamonds, level 1.
[370:50.56]Here we go.
[370:51.52]Is there a cutscene?
[370:58.86]Okay.
[371:01.06]What I meant to say is Mega Man.
[371:06.83]You go really fast.
[371:11.14]It's so fast.
[371:16.79]It really is.
[371:17.47]Rabbits stink.
[371:18.45]Rabbits stink.
[371:25.75]Toaster plus toaster.
[371:27.40]Wait, what?
[371:28.80]Hold on.
[371:31.16]You can combine weapons?
[371:36.96]Toaster plus toaster.
[371:45.56]I kind of want to... Alt is not a good button to have as jump.
[371:54.39]Why couldn't Lawbreakers just be like this?
[372:02.77]Yeah, I know, right?
[372:06.50]Cliffy B, you should just remake Jazz Jackrabbit.
[372:12.78]Put him in Fortnite.
[372:14.10]Wait, he has nothing to do with Fortnite anymore, does he?
[372:16.19]Wait, he never had anything to do with Fortnite to begin with.
[372:23.39]I don't think he's even at that same company.
[372:43.51]I'm just going to go fast.
[372:44.85]That's what I'm supposed to do, right?
[372:51.93]That's what Cliffy would have wanted, right?
[372:53.80]For me to go fast.
[373:05.33]Can't go up there.
[373:10.17]He's not dead.
[373:10.87]What?
[373:11.05]What?
[373:11.51]No, I'm saying... No, that's not what I mean.
[373:14.68]I mean like in 1989 when this game came out.
[373:18.62]Guys!
[373:23.40]I'm sorry.
[373:29.13]No, don't die.
[373:29.85]Fuck, I'm dead.
[373:32.77]Okay, I'll try one more time.
[373:38.19]Fast.
[373:40.93]Oh no, I'm back to the default blaster again.
[373:43.47]That's not good.
[373:45.71]Is he saying meow?
[373:46.61]I feel like that doesn't fit.
[373:49.97]Meow!
[374:04.29]Alright, I gotta get the boss.
[374:05.41]Loading... Come on.
[374:06.65]Let me see a boss.
[374:10.43]I can't pick this up?
[374:12.33]I can't do toaster plus the machine gun thing?
[374:18.50]The music's obnoxious.
[374:20.74]I can't change it.
[374:21.62]Ooh, missiles.
[374:24.86]These are cool.
[374:30.24]Oh, there's a switch.
[374:30.98]Right, okay.
[374:43.69]The controls are really strange.
[374:46.45]Alt is jump, space is fire.
[374:48.23]I should've just switched them.
[374:52.03]Alright, get to Dr. Robotnik.
[375:00.90]There's gotta be a speedrun of this game.
[375:02.16]There has to be.
[375:07.71]Whoa!
[375:15.00]This skull?
[375:16.68]It is Sonic.
[375:18.02]Just not as well made.
[375:22.44]And I don't mean that in a mean way.
[375:26.65]It's also much older than Sonic.
[375:31.97]I got the windows noise.
[375:33.11]Is that supposed to happen?
[375:47.80]Ooh, what's that?
[375:48.24]There's guns?
[375:50.00]Lives?
[375:52.74]Infinite blaster.
[375:54.12]Blaster.
[375:57.12]No, get... Uh, the game's controlling itself.
[376:04.75]I don't have control of the game anymore.
[376:08.61]Oh god!
[376:10.91]Move!
[376:11.41]No, move this way!
[376:14.79]I can't...
[376:17.71]Oh no, he's regressed into Fortnite dancing.
[376:23.74]Oh, I got it.
[376:24.31]No, I'm okay.
[376:25.35]He's auto-firing.
[376:27.29]My hands are in the air.
[376:45.83]pre-recorded gameplay.
[376:50.85]Oh, no, he proved it!
[376:52.17]It was pre-recorded the whole time!
[376:53.85]Alright, let me fight a boss!
[376:58.78]But after your shirt, I explained it earlier, I... I went in too fast.
[377:04.52]And I... hulked through the head accidentally.
[377:08.68]Now we're in 3D.
[377:15.08]This is some Mario Kart shit right here.
[377:16.72]Oops.
[377:29.27]I didn't... I thought... It's okay.
[377:36.40]Alright, that's enough of this one.
[377:38.08]That was really fun though.
[377:39.54]That was a good game for MS-DOS.
[377:43.80]That was Clippybee's voice, wasn't it?
[377:49.91]He's eating a carrot.
[377:50.55]He's gonna say, like, what's up, dog?
[377:56.85]Alright, I'll play this level for 30 seconds.
[378:10.74]Electric eyes, watch it.
[378:15.51]Ooh, launcher.
[378:16.85]Grenades, that's cool.
[378:26.26]Secret wall.
[378:32.05]Oh shit, I thought I... What are you doing?
[378:43.03]RF missiles.
[378:53.57]Oh, he won't turn around anymore.
[378:54.63]Uh-oh.
[378:58.53]I'm gonna get killed by this little baby turtle.
[379:00.39]That was weird.
[379:07.56]Okay, I'll move.
[379:08.10]Stop!
[379:10.24]Alright, it's... I don't know why it won't let me move.
[379:25.36]All right.
[379:26.78]There it is.
[379:27.94]Jazz Jack Revit.
[379:28.66]It was cool.
[379:30.66]Finally, we're going to do a stunt driver.
[379:35.50]I'm going to get the code.
[379:36.52]I'm going to look up what to do.
[379:48.51]All right, so.
[379:50.75]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[379:52.89]I'm not going to... What?
[379:56.20]Look at this shit.
[380:01.21]This is like an IKEA blueprint.
[380:20.99]Replace this line with your specific CD-ROM driver line.
[380:24.84]You only need to use this line with DOS 6.
[380:28.12]Can CD-ROM to book?
[380:33.71]Pre-race setup.
[380:34.53]Use this on the racetrack.
[380:36.31]Head-to-head.
[380:37.25]Track instruction.
[380:39.09]Course 1.
[380:44.11]Hold on, let me...
[381:16.70]Stunt driver.
[381:17.28]Hold on.
[381:17.56]Let's... Let's do this together.
[381:26.16]Course quiz.
[381:26.74]On course 2, page 40... On course 2, what is the piece at location question mark?
[381:39.40]At... At course 2, what is the piece at location I5?
[381:52.52]Course two, I-5, I can't, is it one, two, three, four, five, it's a straight line with a little oil can on the right.
[382:11.98]Straight line with an oil can on the right.
[382:22.52]I think it's this one.
[382:28.16]Alright, here we go.
[382:29.36]How do you drive?
[382:36.60]I got my hand on it.
[382:51.49]Control-Alt.
[382:53.54]P Q R R is... He fucked it up, it's alright.
[383:18.96]You're going the wrong way!
[383:22.27]Turn the car around!
[383:28.70]Q?
[383:29.16]How do I gear it into... Got it.
[383:42.07]Get it out of neutral.
[383:43.15]I can't put it in first gear.
[383:57.23]Oh no!
[383:58.07]Watch out for the Skittles!
[384:03.60]We're in the M&M's candy world!
[384:12.21]Oh my god.
[384:30.20]D. S. A. D. F. W. E. W. R. Q. Tab.
[384:40.79]Shift.
[384:41.71]Space.
[384:47.25]Press 1.
[384:47.71]Not the candies!
[384:53.65]Oh, I just ran over everybody.
[385:03.97]I'm going the wrong way still.
[385:12.02]Alright, the race can start.
[385:16.80]Uh, by the way, this is just, like, binaural beats.
[385:27.57]Two.
[385:27.79]I need to go to second gear.
[385:29.71]Holy shit, that's fast!
[385:33.91]What happened?
[385:41.25]Second gear.
[385:48.44]Marty, we're going warp speed, Marty!
[385:50.38]I don't know about this, Doc!
[385:58.32]Marty!
[386:09.28]I just gave me a headache.
[386:24.43]I have a headache now.
[386:35.61]Well, that was that.
[386:45.32]No, one more, one more.
[386:46.80]No, that's a good one to go on.
[386:54.09]Feed your Yahtzee addiction.
[387:03.04]Encore, encore.
[387:06.62]No, we're going to do this like once a week.
[387:11.74]I was McDonald's ba-da-ba-ba-ba.
[387:15.68]I'm loving it.
[387:17.46]Why did I have to go out on that one?
[387:26.27]That shouldn't have been the one to go out on.
[387:30.51]You could hear halfway through my voice start to give out on that one.
[387:33.31]You did.
[387:38.84]You know, sometimes you have to commit, even though you know it's like, this is a stupid reference and no one's gonna like this.
[387:46.46]That was a nightmare tier joke.
[387:49.40]Oh no!
[387:50.38]Oh no, I better wake up!
[387:51.48]I gotta wake up!
[387:53.24]No!
[387:54.20]No, not a nightmare tier!
[388:00.52]But, that's gonna be it.
[388:03.10]I will see you guys...
[388:06.45]On, what's today?
[388:07.09]Saturday.
[388:08.65]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[388:16.23]Tuesday afternoon.
[388:20.52]I'm going to read the bits.
[388:21.28]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[388:22.42]I'm just for the people that want to take off.
[388:32.64]But this was a little trial test run to see how fun something like this would be, and there's a lot to still play.
[388:39.13]I might change up the format a little bit.
[388:40.65]I might pick a screen, and then we have to pick... uh, like two or three games from that screen.
[388:49.81]I think that's better.
[388:51.71]That way.
[388:53.63]The scroll can still be there, but it will pop up... I mean, maybe it'll just... after we do three, we'll just scroll.
[388:59.85]Instead of rather than just... Because I feel like maybe if you wanted to scroll, you were maybe potentially throwing a vote away to pick a game that was already on the screen.
[389:10.47]So maybe per screen, we would do three, and then I would just scroll down.
[389:19.33]But you'll see this again.
[389:20.03]We'll probably do it next week.
[389:21.33]We'll do some other stuff next week, too.
[389:22.58]Thank you for joining me.
[389:24.28]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[389:25.82]Take care.
[389:26.16]Much love to you if you're leaving.
[389:27.88]Let's get to the bits.
[389:31.09]Let's go to six and a half hours ago here.
[389:35.27]All the way back, all the way back.
[389:36.55]Here we are.
[389:38.81]We had three dollars from Mr. Comcast.
[389:43.73]Mr. Comcast, you sure do like to give me a lot of money.
[389:47.96]How about three and then an option to scroll?
[389:49.60]That's a good idea too.
[389:53.86]We'll play around with the idea.
[389:57.15]Mr. Comcast, hey Jerma, John Comcast here, so sue me for being thorough.
[390:02.01]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[390:04.35]Look, seriously mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[390:08.66]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[390:10.58]We're gonna get the treasure, we're gonna get out of there, and we must get it.
[390:13.74]That's the most important thing, so be on your A-game.
[390:15.90]We go now.
[390:17.04]Also, make me fight Cox in the Jerma Rumble.
[390:19.47]He's old and fragile, and I'll...
[390:24.31]No, you guys are going to be on a tag team.
[390:25.99]It's going to be Cox and Comcast and a tag team.
[390:30.89]And there's going to be a major spoiler that I'm not going to say, but something happens in the middle of that fight.
[390:38.36]Just pretend I didn't say anything.
[390:49.20]But thank you, John Comcast.
[390:53.50]Ay uh - YDNA, thanks for the $16. "Hope you don't die of dysentery" I didn't.
[390:59.50]I got dysentery at the end of the game there but I didn't die from it I just got it.
[391:07.99]Thank you for the 16 bucks. Almost $20, thank you. It's a lot of money.
[391:13.99]We also had 5 community subs from Cole, 5 community subs from big boy eggo.
[391:20.99]Thank you, guys, for your community subs.
[391:24.81]The Great Lord Walden gave $10.
[391:26.61]Here's $10 for a new shirt, you fucking hobo.
[391:30.75]I like... This shirt is... I like this shirt.
[391:33.92]This is a sentimental value shirt.
[391:37.80]I got too many shirts.
[391:40.62]Actually, Kim and I were talking about this.
[391:41.84]We're probably gonna do a donation bag.
[391:44.32]And do a donation of clothes.
[391:46.24]Because I have too many just random t-shirts and... They're nice!
[391:51.09]I just have too many shirts.
[391:55.19]I have 10 shirts to one pair of pants.
[392:04.24]Do a giveaway on stream.
[392:05.70]No, I don't want anyone to bother you guys.
[392:06.96]I have my clothes.
[392:09.74]Something about that, I don't know, but something about that's weird to me.
[392:19.69]You should sew the collar.
[392:21.05]I don't want to do that.
[392:22.57]I'd rather be able to put it on two different ways.
[392:25.14]But thank you, Great Lord Walden, for the $10.
[392:26.38]Uh, Zake!
[392:29.08]Thank you, Zake, for the $2.50.
[392:31.28]Hello, Jerma985.
[392:32.64]Just want to share a cute picture of me and my dog.
[392:34.46]Let's take a look.
[392:43.19]Uh, I...
[392:50.83]This is an interesting picture.
[392:53.20]It's very, uh, is that you in the picture?
[392:55.80]Uh... That's interesting.
[393:01.02]It's you and a, uh, it's you and a dog butt.
[393:17.11]That looks like an old fucking picture too.
[393:30.48]This is like a crumply, crumply picture.
[393:38.56]What do you mean?
[393:38.98]What's the effect?
[393:40.12]I don't know.
[393:40.62]He's a baby.
[393:45.06]Oh, what the fuck?
[393:45.62]He's a baby, right?
[393:50.02]Is this not even you and your dog?
[393:51.32]Is this not you and your dog?
[393:52.20]No, this is definitely you and your dog.
[393:58.40]Just hanging out.
[393:59.02]Let's see what it is.
[394:09.96]Thank you for the 250.
[394:10.80]That's a picture of me.
[394:30.00]Well, uh...
[394:36.06]No, that's just a boy and his dog hanging out.
[394:39.42]Stop.
[394:40.06]Uh, thank you for the $2.50.
[394:40.72]Hey, Mitchell, thanks for the $5.
[394:49.53]Here's some dosh for an unchewed shirt.
[394:58.30]It's not chewed.
[395:05.76]It's a little crumbled, but that's fine.
[395:18.40]Thank you, though, Mitchell, for the five bucks.
[395:21.84]I'm gonna replace my shirts with better shirts.
[395:23.76]Okay, does that make you guys happy?
[395:29.81]John Cena for life, thanks for the three dollars.
[395:32.11]Hey Jerma, did you see the Final Fantasy 7 remake trailer that recently came out?
[395:34.91]It looks great.
[395:36.11]Also, did you have... Also, did or have you played any other Final Fantasy games?
[395:41.47]Good.
[395:43.09]Keep up the good work.
[395:43.95]Thank you.
[395:46.59]I'm actually not really that interested in Final Fantasy 7 or the remake.
[395:51.75]The original one is good, but it's not really... I wouldn't put that in my top five.
[395:57.77]Top 10, really.
[395:58.89]It's not that I don't think the game is any good.
[396:00.59]It's just not kind of anything I really cared that much about.
[396:03.40]It's a great game.
[396:06.76]But, Final Fantasy-wise, I played the old ones.
[396:11.18]Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3.
[396:14.53]But for the most part, I was a... I'm one of those chrono boomers.
[396:19.99]I'm one of those, like, chrono series hipsters that loves that series more than Final Fantasy.
[396:26.34]And every time somebody mentions Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy whatever...
[396:31.52]It doesn't matter.
[396:32.02]I'm always the one that goes, I just wish they would make another Chrono, goddammit.
[396:35.34]I think it's one of my favorite series ever.
[396:38.35]I'm a Chrono hipster.
[396:44.97]It's not Chrono hipster, it's Chrono normie.
[396:48.33]Wouldn't the Final Fantasy be the normie and Chrono Trigger be the hipster?
[396:53.69]Chrono Trigger has two games.
[396:58.29]Final Fantasy has like 30.
[397:02.84]There are like 34 Final Fantasy games.
[397:08.23]Chrono Loser.
[397:12.27]No, Chrono's not mainstream.
[397:14.03]Just because they've re-released it 12 times doesn't mean everybody bought it.
[397:28.44]But, uh, yeah, I...
[397:31.23]Final Fantasy is a cool series.
[397:32.55]I like the original ones.
[397:33.37]I'm not a big fan of the later ones, though.
[397:36.45]Just wasn't my thing.
[397:38.60]I hope it's good.
[397:39.34]I hope Final Fantasy VII Remake is good.
[397:47.80]I remember when the movie... They did that weird sequel movie, and I remember that was a huge deal.
[397:54.05]I watched it.
[397:55.97]The 3D animated one.
[398:00.40]That was a huge fucking deal when that came out.
[398:04.25]No, not Megamind.
[398:05.29]It was like Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
[398:08.71]There it is, yeah.
[398:09.71]That was a big deal.
[398:18.82]Megamind was bigger.
[398:21.12]Well, yes, his mind was bigger.
[398:25.95]Well, thank you, John Cena for life.
[398:27.41]Hopefully Final Fantasy VII Remake is good and hopefully lives up to your expectations.
[398:32.00]Hope so.
[398:33.70]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $5.
[398:34.62]Jeremiah, I hate being a goblin.
[398:36.60]Give me your beauty tips.
[398:41.68]Beauty tips.
[398:42.14]Let's see.
[398:42.94]Eat more fish.
[398:45.84]It's good for your skin.
[398:48.30]Talking like oily fish.
[398:49.26]We're talking salmon, sardines, anchovies.
[398:55.52]Make sure you drink enough water.
[398:56.44]Nobody drinks enough water.
[399:00.24]Replace two or three sodas or two or three juices with water.
[399:04.18]Drink enough water.
[399:07.50]Beauty tips.
[399:08.04]Get enough sleep.
[399:09.02]Try to sleep at least six hours a night.
[399:12.37]Sleeping less than four or five hours a night every night is just not good for you.
[399:18.77]What else, what else, what else, what else?
[399:25.67]Stop drinking.
[399:26.31]No, another one.
[399:27.85]Stop drinking so much alcohol.
[399:30.77]Alcohol's good, but it really, it's like inflammatory, like fucking... Drink, drink as much as you want if you're of age, but... Replace a couple of beers with some waters.
[399:48.50]Just actively try to take care of yourself on a day-to-day basis.
[399:53.92]Now, that means, yes, you can eat Burger King...
[399:57.22]But if you eat Burger King, maybe the next day, try to have like a... Like a salmon salad with like a bunch of good... Couple of sides, you know?
[400:05.74]Just balance yourself up.
[400:07.76]It's really easy just to order this like same bad shit all the time.
[400:12.01]I do it all.
[400:12.61]I've done it.
[400:13.01]I do.
[400:13.25]I still do it.
[400:14.69]But balance yourself up.
[400:17.39]And just drink water, forehead.
[400:18.81]Yeah.
[400:20.29]Uh, Table Row.
[400:21.09]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Table Row.
[400:23.27]Hey, Jermabud.
[400:23.91]You don't need to tell you how many lives you improved.
[400:26.04]Thanks, Jermabud.
[400:29.58]I'm honored and thankful that anyone would ever say something like that.
[400:31.88]Thanks so much.
[400:34.10]If I improve your life just by us hanging out here and playing games and just... Broadcasting the video stuff, then... I'm... Thank you.
[400:42.95]That's awesome.
[400:44.03]I hope you... I hope you're doing good.
[400:50.45]But what if you make my life worse?
[400:56.82]With a smiley.
[400:59.96]Can I get a couple of the Dremel pops in the chat, please?
[401:01.59]I just want to see them, because I just put it up there today if you didn't know, if you just got to the channel here.
[401:06.57]But thank you, Table Roll.
[401:11.22]Also, we had a bunch of $50 donations come in.
[401:14.30]$55 from Cure, $50 from Lecron, $53 from Vilemi, $50 again from Vilemi, $130, $103 from Vilemi total.
[401:29.88]50s all around from La Cranda.
[401:34.08]A lot of money came in over the course of like an hour there.
[401:36.91]So thank you guys, all of you.
[401:40.47]The Jack, thank you for 250.
[401:42.55]Who do you work for?
[401:43.61]Credit to DoopieFoop on Discord.
[401:47.13]We saw this earlier.
[401:48.80]I was saying, you even got like the bump on my right side of my nose.
[401:56.20]Or left side of my nose, actually.
[401:57.62]It's mirrored.
[402:02.56]That was fucking hysterical.
[402:03.96]That was the funniest thing I've seen in a while.
[402:07.75]The... ghost ride... the Batmobile into a fucking city.
[402:15.30]It was just unbelievable that you could do that.
[402:21.84]Thank you, though.
[402:25.60]We also had 250 from Frodeon Weapon.
[402:29.06]What the hell is a Vodka Pineapple and where can I get one?
[402:35.20]Also, Happy Saturday.
[402:37.96]Love these MS-DOS games.
[402:40.88]Jerma Heart and then Jerma Pop.
[402:42.10]Can we get a couple of Jerma Pops, please?
[402:52.25]Thank you.
[402:54.71]A vodka pineapple is pineapple juice and vodka.
[402:59.11]That's pretty much it.
[403:01.57]Or you can do pineapple juice, orange juice, and vodka as well.
[403:06.32]But it's just pineapple juice and vodka.
[403:11.98]It's pretty good.
[403:13.60]If you like pineapple juice.
[403:19.45]Happy Saturday to you as well, and I also enjoy the MS-DOS.
[403:24.04]It's a before time, right?
[403:27.32]Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[403:31.56]Coming in with five community subs.
[403:33.22]The Fuck Club has returned.
[403:39.57]They have gifted 747 subs to this channel.
[403:41.01]They are responsible for 747 subs.
[403:54.20]That's... Insanity.
[403:58.94]Does that count right now, or is that total forever?
[404:02.06]Always?
[404:05.05]Is that what you currently have right now?
[404:09.07]I think that's, yeah, I think that's total.
[404:11.95]I don't think that's, um, like, current, right?
[404:14.69]Like... Whatever the case is, that's 750 fucking subs. 757.
[404:26.84]Thank you so much for your insane contributions.
[404:31.82]And thank you for the five community subs here right now.
[404:37.09]Thank you.

[404:58.80]Thank you, K... Thank you, KD... Econwar.
[405:03.70]Econwar.
[405:04.34]Kdeconwar.
[405:05.27]I think that's how I'm saying it.
[405:07.69]Thanks for the $10. $10.
[405:13.37]Stay frosty out there, Jerma.
[405:14.05]Well, congratulations for getting through college.
[405:15.39]It can be rough.
[405:15.82]It's work.
[405:16.18]It's a lot of work.
[405:16.74]But, grats on that, first of all.
[405:17.78]And second of all,
[405:46.61]I'm a good and relatable dude with a good head on his shoulders.
[405:51.54]My mother would love you.
[405:57.04]Thank you for the incredibly kind words.
[405:58.64]I'm going to stay as frosty as I can.
[406:04.99]Thank you for the support.
[406:06.55]And thanks for hanging out.
[406:15.56]Thank you for the $10.

[406:31.84]Mario on the inside.
[406:32.92]I promise it's not the dog asshole.
[406:35.30]Mario on the outside, Mario on the inside.
[406:46.18]I didn't even know that that game existed.
[406:57.65]What a cool game.
[407:00.37]Mario has been able to stay so relevant forever.
[407:05.40]We should just, like, elect Mario to Congress.
[407:15.58]Mario nor me a there's no there's no such thing No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no such thing It's gonna happen in a video game movie just watch Mario is not a US citizen.
[407:39.47]He's a world citizen He will govern us all
[407:44.26]From his ivory tower.
[407:50.55]Chrono Mario.
[407:54.15]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[407:58.52]Uh, thank you, Deus Morte, for the 250.
[408:01.00]Hello, Jeremy.
[408:01.88]You kept making strange noises during yesterday's stream, so I thought I'd throw them in this song I threw together in an hour.
[408:08.14]Enjoy.
[408:08.52]Jermapop.
[408:12.36]Feel hungry?
[408:14.60]My time's on the filling box.
[408:51.75]So after tomorrow's Ace Attorney stream, we will pick back up on Wednesday.
[409:13.06]That is an oof.
[409:13.72]That's a big oof right there.
[409:23.07]That's a big one.
[409:28.85]Hey, okay, but what about Sam and Max?
[409:30.58]Give me some credit for Sam.
[409:31.42]I told you guys I was going to play Sam and Max for a while, and I kept putting it up, but then I did it, and we were doing it.
[409:37.22]We traded Ace Attorney for Sam and Max.
[409:49.21]You can play both.
[409:50.91]I could.
[409:51.93]I could.
[409:53.28]But will I?
[409:54.78]No.
[410:03.74]Yes!
[410:07.24]I don't know.
[410:07.76]I don't think I'm going to play Ace Attorney.
[410:09.65]Let me just rip the band-aid off.
[410:10.93]I don't think I'm going to do it.
[410:14.25]I checked it out.
[410:15.33]I don't know if that's a game that I want to stream.
[410:18.71]I'm just gonna rip this, take it off, rip the band-aid off.
[410:25.41]Didn't we have this discussion already?
[410:26.93]Yeah, but, you know, something... A lot of people on this channel.
[410:31.57]There are thousands of people, and maybe you didn't hear it, and maybe you don't know, you know?
[410:35.49]It's not easy to keep up with everything.
[410:43.19]There's not that many.
[410:44.75]Egomaniac.
[410:45.65]What?
[410:50.52]That's not true?
[410:52.36]Do my eyes deceive me?
[411:00.38]You're crashing the stock market.
[411:10.37]Sell all stocks.
[411:15.05]Quickly.
[411:16.25]Before they go to zero.
[411:23.41]But I don't think so.
[411:29.35]I don't want to keep putting the carrot in front of everybody.
[411:32.29]Maybe next time.
[411:32.83]Maybe next time.
[411:33.47]No, no, no.
[411:39.26]I invested in German and I'm down 3k.
[411:40.90]Did you invest in Kiwo like I told you to?
[411:42.78]Remember I told you.
[411:43.88]What did I say specifically?
[411:44.68]Put all your money into Kiwo.
[411:46.28]I said that.
[411:48.46]Kiwo's stock is up like fucking 500%.
[411:51.08]I told you.
[411:52.40]You should have listened to me.
[412:03.34]Did you play the game?
[412:04.16]Yes, I did.
[412:06.98]I did play the first Ace Attorney for maybe 15-20 minutes.
[412:14.95]I'll tell you, I'll tell you something that I really don't, I didn't, I didn't like.
[412:18.53]I don't know if you can turn this off, but the screen flash.
[412:26.15]It seems like every 10 seconds there's a like a white flash on the screen.
[412:34.56]And it was kind of giving me a headache.
[412:40.57]I'm just being completely honest.
[412:47.23]During the dialogue, it's just like, white flash, white flash, white flash, white flash, white flash.
[412:56.64]It's dramatic.
[412:57.72]It's kind of just getting flashed in the face.
[413:01.86]That's why?
[413:02.28]No, that's not why.
[413:03.16]Somebody asked if I tried it, and I did.
[413:08.87]That's not why I wasn't going to play it.
[413:10.19]It just seemed like... It seemed like it was going to take a long time to... And it almost solely relied on the dialogue.
[413:18.93]Which I would have to read.
[413:20.57]And instead of something like Sorcery, which... Reading was... I could kind of put my own spin on it.
[413:25.65]We could choose different things to do.
[413:27.53]It's more of just kind of a visual novel.
[413:39.07]I would much rather play that comfy, like, under my blankets with a tea and just sit there silent and, like, investigate than stream something like that.
[413:48.97]Is what I kind of came to the determination of.
[414:03.90]But...
[414:06.11]Yeah, I don't want to... Obviously, I don't think it's a bad series.
[414:10.67]That's... No way.
[414:13.29]No way.
[414:14.75]Just don't think I want to stream that game.
[414:16.89]Or the series.
[414:17.33]I'm sorry.
[414:18.49]I'm sorry.
[414:20.33]Do I play games without streaming them?
[414:21.83]Yeah.
[414:23.75]I actually just played Forager for a little while.
[414:26.61]For like four or five hours over the last couple weeks.
[414:31.07]It's fun.
[414:32.49]I don't really talk that much about the random stuff I play off stream.
[414:41.28]He's cheating on us.
[414:45.54]How do you find the time to do it?
[414:47.94]I, uh... It really depends.
[414:51.38]Like, sometimes... Well, 90% of every game I play is on stream.
[414:58.10]But... I don't know.
[414:59.75]I have a few hours.
[415:00.65]Sometimes... Just jump into... I actually restarted Sekiro.
[415:07.07]Not yesterday.
[415:08.05]The day... I mean, like, a couple... Maybe, like, three or four weeks ago?
[415:11.88]I like restarted it and played it like kind of casually off and on to do the other stuff.
[415:18.86]And I'm just still kind of letting it play out.
[415:23.85]Does it feel weird to not talk while you play?
[415:25.53]No, not really.
[415:26.35]The game has no replayability.
[415:33.11]Well, it doesn't have... In the traditional sense, no.
[415:38.43]But there's a couple of endings that you...
[415:41.79]There's like three or four bosses that I didn't see.
[415:47.33]So there's content that I didn't get to play, and I would get to play it if I went through it one more time, right?
[415:54.86]Or something like that.
[415:55.46]It has like four or five different endings.
[415:56.96]There's like other content and bosses and stuff that you can get with the different stuff, maybe, from what I understand.
[416:05.68]That is replayability.
[416:06.62]Yeah, but not in like the Dark Souls kind of replayability, where there's... The bosses are, oh, you can go and do whatever you want, but you can pick a different weapon, and take a different class, and try a different spell, and... You can replay through Sekiro a few times.
[416:23.05]Maybe twice, three times, maybe, if you want to get all the endings, and...
[416:28.42]But the game stays the same.
[416:30.35]Unless, you know, obviously I don't want to keep... I don't want to keep having... I want spoilers to not be here for anyone that hasn't played it yet.
[416:37.53]But there's like three or four plus endings, right?
[416:40.77]Have you ever played Enter the Gungeon?
[416:52.19]Yes, I have.
[416:57.47]Depends on how much you like it, whatever floats your boat.
[416:59.53]Oh, yeah, if you like something and you do it, and you want to play it through more than 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 times, how... You know, it's your time and it's your money, right?
[417:08.91]Like, if you buy something and you want to spend the time doing it, absolutely.
[417:21.88]Is this VOD worth watching?
[417:24.26]Absolutely.
[417:25.36]Yes.
[417:26.32]Alright, by the show, is it VOD worth watching?
[417:29.84]We got another question here.
[417:33.34]Hey.
[417:35.66]Hey.
[417:36.20]Hey.
[417:37.66]What?
[417:39.90]What are you, no, you're memeing me here.
[417:41.86]What about, we had a lot of fun with that.
[417:43.84]What about Batman?
[417:44.60]Alright, just skip to the Batman part, and then rewind and watch all the rest of it, because it's good.
[417:56.40]I can't believe I clicked a porn game.
[418:00.18]I actually did that tonight.
[418:07.92]Holy shit.
[418:16.13]Well, it was text only.
[418:17.17]We had to use our imaginations.
[418:20.71]And chat really had to use their imaginations because they didn't get to see anything.
[418:26.42]No, but all jokes aside, I loved it.
[418:28.24]I had a lot of fun tonight.
[418:29.70]And we're gonna definitely do it again.
[418:32.60]Oh, yes.
[418:33.16]Go watch the VOD.
[418:33.82]Don't... Come on.
[418:36.58]Uh... Hey!
[418:38.49]Thank you to... Uh, we got multi-trip earlier thanks to the 10 bucks multi-trip.
[418:44.09]I had a dream that you couldn't get any of the DOS games to work and got really frustrated and streamed Mordhau instead.
[418:49.31]It would have happened.
[418:50.39]That's probably exactly... No, we probably just went to Sam and Max.
[418:54.05]If this was a catastrophe stream, I would've just went right to episode 3.
[418:59.67]Even a second.
[419:00.43]It would've taken one second.
[419:04.25]But thank you for the $10.
[419:05.13]Thank you, The Jack, for the $2.50.
[419:06.37]If you decide to give Jazz Jackrabbit 2 a try, there's a fan project called Jazz Jackrabbit 2 Plus that adds a bunch of fixes and quality of life improvements, including Xbox controller support.
[419:20.64]To, like, a 25-year-old game.
[419:22.92]Holy shit.
[419:24.48]How do people even do this?
[419:30.32]Some big brains out there.
[419:34.25]I will definitely keep that in mind, though.
[419:35.35]Because we'll be doing this again.
[419:38.91]I got Sam and Max in the back pocket always.
[419:45.80]But I'll keep that in mind thanks to the 250, the jack.
[419:50.20]It is the best turn-based RPG that has ever been made.
[419:51.54]It's just... It just is.
[419:52.32]It was very well before its time.
[419:53.28]I think it's the best turn-based RPG.
[420:23.34]I, I, that's, I don't, that's just my opinion.
[420:33.13]Here comes a backpedal.
[420:34.15]No!
[420:35.31]No backpedal!
[420:37.09]I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG turn-based, remember, we're not, I'm not talking action RPG, that's Diablo 2.
[420:45.92]I'll do it for you.
[420:47.28]Turn-based RPG, Chrono Trigger.
[420:50.38]Uh, Action RPG.
[420:52.76]Diablo 2.
[420:54.85]What other RPGs are there?
[420:57.33]Role-playing RPG.
[420:58.65]No, um, what's another one?
[421:06.48]MMORPG.
[421:07.64]Ooh, that's a tough one.
[421:08.88]I'd have to say World of Warcraft.
[421:12.10]The Frozen Throne.
[421:13.34]Wrath of the Lich King.
[421:16.11]That's the best MMORPG.
[421:23.77]What's the best?
[421:24.69]FPS RPG.
[421:30.45]Uh, FPS RPG.
[421:35.04]FPS RPG.
[421:37.08]Let me think about this.
[421:37.86]I mean, there really only are kind of a handful.
[421:40.96]There's like Fallout, there's like Borderlands, which I would not put Borderlands even on that list.
[421:47.12]No, I don't think so.
[421:50.21]Um...
[421:59.65]I don't think Borderlands is, like, a top, like, two or three.
[422:05.33]I wouldn't put Borderlands in the top three for me.
[422:08.07]For first-person shooter RPGs.
[422:10.49]New Vegas would be there, but New Vegas is also not... You can do that in third person.
[422:19.68]Might and Magic Dark Messiah.
[422:21.10]Yeah, that's number one.
[422:23.98]Bioshock is, yeah, it's not really an RPG.
[422:32.57]Cyberpunk.
[422:34.27]Well, when Cyberpunk comes out, I think all bets are off.
[422:40.49]Borderlands 1 was cool.
[422:42.53]Borderlands 2 was alright.
[422:43.85]It's just they kind of did the same game three times.
[422:47.41]They did that, like, Borderlands pre-sequel, and it's just like, what the fuck are you doing?
[422:55.40]And then Borderlands 3, it's just like, alright.
[422:57.44]It's like...
[423:00.50]I like Borderlands 1, I like Borderlands 2.
[423:02.24]It's just kind of like I... It's... We're kind of... Um... If you like just loot boxes and shooting and different combinations and yeah, it can be addicting.
[423:14.36]I just kind of got sick of it after the second game.
[423:28.08]I have heard the Telltale Borderlands game.
[423:31.00]Weirdly enough, I have been told that Tales from the Borderlands is the best Borderlands game.
[423:42.73]I've been told that a couple of times.
[423:46.69]Yeah, I've been told that at least twice.
[423:58.55]It's easily the best Telltale game.
[424:01.27]Yep.
[424:07.56]Um... I'm trying to think of what other first-person RPGs exist.
[424:14.46]It's definitely Dark Messiah.
[424:17.28]That game is just so hilariously interesting.
[424:22.00]Um... Skyrim, but... Mmm...
[424:29.29]I don't know, do the Bethesda games count because they're not first person?
[424:37.71]Was Dark Messiah actually a good game?
[424:39.05]It seemed like a meme.
[424:39.91]No, it isn't.
[424:41.39]I mean, it is a meme.
[424:44.21]But it's still a really fun game.
[424:48.67]Fallout 76, are those servers still on?
[425:02.00]I'm actually serious.
[425:04.40]I don't know if they are or not.
[425:10.81]We got some news today out of the game development.
[425:15.03]NHL 2K11, NBA 2K14, Phantasy Star Online 2, and Fallout 76 have had their servers discontinued today.
[425:34.38]Oh, fuck, really?
[425:41.90]That's too bad.
[425:46.66]What's my favorite animal?
[425:47.48]Armadillo.
[425:48.04]That's an easy one.
[425:48.86]Next question.
[425:54.26]But, yeah, there's a few games.
[426:01.02]Classic WoW.
[426:02.00]Yeah, that's gonna be fun, I think.
[426:05.43]Unless... If Blizzard could just fuck it all up.
[426:09.35]My faith in Blizzard is... Right at the front door.
[426:13.29]It's just right outside at this point.
[426:16.83]It's like if you... Alright, you can't... Are you gonna... What are you doing here?
[426:20.46]Come on in.
[426:21.54]Show... Put the... Put the like... Roadmap of your game up on the glass.
[426:26.66]Before I let you in.
[426:27.66]The store.
[426:28.82]Just go to my... Hold it up.
[426:32.60]Mmm...
[426:37.61]All right, come on in.
[426:43.69]Roadmats are a lie.
[426:46.47]No, Blizzard, I think, Blizzard's in an interesting scenario here where they've made like two or three really, really like bogus bonehead plays in the last three or four years.
[426:57.80]That WoW classic needs to be good.
[427:06.62]Warcraft 3's remake and WoW Classic coming back need to be pretty good.
[427:15.53]Or they've got to announce something that they're working on because a lot of people are not happy.
[427:21.53]It's gonna be WoW Classic.
[427:23.15]Yeah, but weren't they talking about how they were thinking of changing some stuff?
[427:27.44]Weren't they saying that they were changing things and they were trying to make it more streamlined?
[427:31.76]They did mention that they were gonna do stuff to it, right?
[427:35.12]I don't think it's just WoW Patch 1.2.
[427:45.50]So who knows?
[427:46.02]They might, they went back on that.
[427:48.06]Did they?
[427:48.70]Did they go back on that?
[427:51.54]I don't know, we'll see what they end up doing.
[427:59.88]Diablo is doomed, WoW expansion's bad, HOTS is dead, Overwatch is kinda hanging on.
[428:07.07]Overwatch is on death's door, it's a shame.
[428:09.05]Yeah, they just dropped the ball.
[428:15.33]At least a few times.
[428:20.03]They kind of pulled a Valve, but Valve just, before they made a bunch of bad plays, just, like, forfeited the game.
[428:25.76]You know what I mean?
[428:37.31]Blizzard needs glasses.
[428:40.21]Although... Valve...
[428:44.48]is slowly, slowly they've been working kind of behind the scenes here with this whole VR stuff, and they got at least three or four games in development here.
[428:54.39]That are gonna be exclusives to the Index, right?
[428:57.63]Yep, yep.
[428:58.59]Fuck me, right?
[429:00.85]I think I'll get the HTC Vive.
[429:04.09]All of a sudden, hey, the Index is coming out, and it's gonna have like three exclusive Valve games.
[429:09.87]They're not exclusive?
[429:10.60]Thank God.
[429:16.23]I was so scared there for a second.
[429:23.99]But Valve got to that point where people were like, Hey, what the hell's going on here?
[429:28.85]What's this?
[429:29.80]What's this thing that you released that I'm not very happy with?
[429:32.70]They were just like, I quit!
[429:33.82]I'm done making games forever!
[429:35.02]Bye-bye!
[429:35.88]And then they just slammed the door and put up an out-of-order sign.
[429:42.54]Blizzard...
[429:44.92]had that same scenario, except they were like, what about this game?
[429:47.90]Ah, I don't like that.
[429:49.02]What about this one?
[429:49.68]This one's kind of stupid too.
[429:51.40]No, we don't want that.
[429:52.32]What about this one?
[429:52.90]This one sucks.
[429:53.64]No, we don't want that either.
[429:55.40]And now they've kind of buried themselves.
[430:02.81]Hey, we gotta go grocery shopping.
[430:04.25]Oh, shit, that's right.
[430:05.79]We gotta go grocery shopping.
[430:12.07]We're almost done.
[430:12.53]We're almost done.
[430:13.65]Uh, but
[430:16.82]Gabe Newell actually said something like, people not liking Mass Effect 3 caused him to stop devving on Half-Life 3.
[430:22.55]Really?
[430:27.94]Valve doesn't have investors to answer to so they don't have to pressure to output games.
[430:31.32]Yeah, I think Valve made the right call with that.
[430:34.68]Because if they didn't think they could make good products, then they weren't going to make them.
[430:39.62]I think that's been their MO for a long time.
[430:42.42]It's kind of, it sucks that you don't, you know, we don't get a Left 4 Dead 3.
[430:45.91]We don't have like a big huge TF3 or Team Fortress update, right, that changes the game that much.
[430:52.81]We got Artifact, but I don't, I don't play, I don't, that doesn't do it for me at all.
[430:57.99]It's like a card game, I don't really play them.
[431:02.24]And then they, they just kind of went into the business side of games, which you could argue is, you know, might not been the greatest thing in the grand scheme of things, because that's how we kind of invented the whole open boxes for money thing.
[431:17.77]That was Valve.
[431:18.57]Valve kind of paved the way for that.
[431:25.73]The open-up loot boxes for cash was like a Team Fortress and Counter-Strike thing.
[431:33.09]TF2 crates.
[431:36.49]And yeah, even they took that from, like, what, those old Japanese mobile games, right?
[431:46.30]FIFA, yeah, FIFA with the card packs.
[431:53.24]But not like a box with stuff in it.
[431:56.58]The card packs were just... You opened up card packs, right?
[432:01.76]FIFA is patient zero, but Valve really perfected that open up the box and get an item for the game.
[432:10.85]It is the same idea, but the FIFA cards didn't affect anything in the game, right?
[432:26.79]Did they?
[432:30.11]Wait, hold on.
[432:30.59]The FIFA cards?
[432:32.13]I thought it was like you just opened up cards and had like a card collection with like golds and stuff.
[432:39.48]You actually... That's how you get the players?
[432:50.77]Oh my god.
[432:53.95]FIFA is pay to win.
[432:55.59]No, really?
[432:57.87]Wow.
[433:00.44]Holy shit.
[433:01.34]Okay, well, that's unbelievable.
[433:05.86]But, uh, the EA, FIFA, even as early as, you know, Team Fortress, that all the kind of open up boxes get new weapon or new skin, right?
[433:25.10]They expire.
[433:25.94]Oh my goodness.
[433:28.20]That's evil if they expire.
[433:29.95]You have to keep opening them?
[433:33.53]Holy shit.
[433:37.53]But... I think that they'll turn.
[433:39.96]There'll be a turnaround here.
[433:42.59]Regardless of all the crazy fucked up shit that's happening in this industry right now in the last four or five years.
[433:49.99]There'll be a turnaround.
[433:50.97]There'll be some new shit that's interesting that... I think that some of these companies are gonna start to realize that people are annoyed by this kind of behavior.
[433:59.38]They don't like this shit.
[434:00.62]Nobody likes this shit.
[434:03.48]So, unfortunately, the people that are playing the games that have been playing games for the last five to ten years kind of had to be the guinea pigs for all this stuff until everyone was like, hey, could you stop doing this to us, please?
[434:15.59]Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[434:16.44]I didn't think that you don't like this fucked up kind of behavior.
[434:19.52]Oh, yeah, I guess we'll stop.
[434:25.32]Did you beat Mario and Checkers yet?
[434:27.06]I smoked them.
[434:33.84]People love this shit, it makes all the money.
[434:36.84]Yeah, but... People like to gamble too, you know?
[434:42.64]That's all it is, it scratches the same itch as pulling like a slot machine lever.
[434:47.66]Why do you think casinos are so popular?
[434:53.11]It's the same idea.
[434:55.31]A potential random generated thing where you could get something awesome or something terrible.
[435:07.34]You're the expert on gambling.
[435:08.82]I say, I'm telling you, I know.
[435:15.29]But I gotta get out of here.
[435:17.59]Gotta go to the grocery store before they close.
[435:20.47]So let's get through the last handful of bits.
[435:22.14]Let's get the credits on the screen too.
[435:26.78]We can sit here and talk for hours about the state of the game industry.
[435:34.61]I'm not necessarily an expert on all this, but I do have some opinions, as you've heard.
[435:42.60]But, get the credits on the screen.
[435:45.14]Here come all the new subs and all the resubs for today.
[435:47.08]Thank you, everybody.
[435:51.80]There were a lot.
[435:56.21]Just don't play bad games.
[436:04.86]That was a big one.
[436:05.40]That was like three or four at the same time.
[436:11.88]Did somebody say it was Vinny's birthday today?
[436:15.94]I mean, if it's Vinny's birthday, we're gonna... Is it actually Vinny's birthday, or was somebody just, uh... Somebody just messing around?
[436:25.45]Actually Vinny's birthday.
[436:27.75]Is it?
[436:28.27]For real?
[436:29.31]Can we confirm that before I send 1,500 people to his channel to say happy birthday?
[436:39.25]Google it, but okay.
[436:41.13]What is Vinnie Vinesauce's birthday?
[436:51.11]Holy shit, it is.
[436:53.25]Well, not yet.
[436:53.83]Not yet.
[436:54.01]It's tomorrow.
[436:54.85]It's tomorrow.
[436:56.41]Well, I'm not gonna see him tomorrow.
[436:57.87]Let's just say happy birthday tomorrow.
[437:04.48]He has 7k viewers.
[437:05.84]He doesn't care about your 50 viewer raid.
[437:11.43]Jesus.
[437:15.35]It's actually like 1,400, 1,500.
[437:17.13]I think that's a lot more than 50.
[437:25.99]Oh, no, it's New York, right.
[437:27.27]So 10, 11, 12.
[437:27.63]Oh, OK, yeah.
[437:28.77]No, it is New York.
[437:30.64]Happy birthday to Vinny.
[437:32.50]It's 12.
[437:32.94]It's 1 o'clock in the morning.
[437:34.14]Happy birthday, Vinny.
[437:34.74]50 viewer rate.
[437:39.84]Jeez, man.
[437:44.84]Some of you guys are vicious!
[437:51.55]Oh my god.
[437:55.05]Alright, so, we're gonna raid Vinny.
[437:57.43]But we're gonna do- get the last bits here, there's like two or three more.
[437:59.79]Uh, but the Chrono Trigger, kind of tangent, was from Frodeon Weapon that got us on there.
[438:06.76]250.
[438:07.72]Play Chrono Trigger, it's an amazing game.
[438:10.08]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the 250.
[438:12.74]I know I could have put this in recommended, but I want to hear direct thoughts on it in chats too.
[438:17.73]I really want to see you stream a game you know and played before and just show us that haven't played its secrets and whatnot.
[438:24.63]Just guide us through and show us why you enjoy it so much.
[438:27.51]Games like Resident Evil 4, Chrono Trigger, whatever game is up in your top 10.
[438:33.45]I mean, I could do that.
[438:35.73]If people really wanted me to do that, I could do it.
[438:43.94]Play like Mario RPG and show you everything and why I think it's so cool and fun.
[438:48.86]Play Chrono Trigger.
[438:49.68]It's an interesting idea.
[438:53.94]That'd be cool.
[438:54.44]It'd be different.
[438:55.18]It sounds like fun.
[439:00.81]Yeah, we'll plan on it.
[439:02.31]Let's plan on it.
[439:04.57]Could be nostalgic.
[439:05.97]Mario RPG.
[439:06.71]I would probably start with Mario RPG.
[439:08.09]That's my favorite game ever made.
[439:10.75]So, I would probably start there.
[439:13.96]The German classics.
[439:15.56]Well, I didn't make them.
[439:18.47]But that's a great recommendation.
[439:19.51]Thank you, Snooze and Copter.
[439:22.13]I've toyed with it.
[439:23.71]We've talked about it a few times.
[439:25.15]I just never pulled the trigger on it, because I just don't know if people want to see somebody just go, oh, I know what's here.
[439:30.13]I know what's over here.
[439:31.08]Go, look, this is cool.
[439:31.86]Watch this part.
[439:32.58]Hey, you should watch this part of the movie.
[439:33.58]This is the part where he dies.
[439:35.78]You know, I feel like I'd be that guy at the movie that tells you the cool parts to watch.
[439:40.60]But...
[439:46.37]You know?
[439:47.73]It is what it is.
[439:50.09]Maybe I'll take the dive.
[439:54.77]The Neverhood?
[439:55.25]The Neverhood's hard to get to work past a certain point.
[440:01.15]I just wish they would release it.
[440:02.92]Remake it.
[440:04.12]G.O.G.
[440:04.68]is not on top of that.
[440:06.66]That's surprising.
[440:08.54]But, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[440:10.16]How dare you tell me to take care of myself.
[440:12.16]The nerve of you to be nice to me.
[440:14.53]But seriously, love your streams and everything.
[440:16.10]Dermapop.
[440:18.22]Here, here.
[440:19.54]Thank you.
[440:21.70]Freudian, you've been around for a long time.
[440:22.94]You've given a lot of money.
[440:23.80]You're a big part of the stream community, especially when we hang out here at the end.
[440:28.50]So thank you.
[440:30.70]And of course I'm going to be nice to you.
[440:31.96]The nerve of me.
[440:33.06]How dare I?
[440:34.74]And FreudianWeapon251, one more thing.
[440:36.79]The bit readings are probably my favorite part of these streams because of all the funny jokes chat comes up with.
[440:41.19]Gonna get some Dermahart and Dermapops for chat.
[440:43.05]Dermahart, Dermapop.
[440:47.34]Yeah.
[440:48.90]No, I like the... ending of the streams.
[440:51.90]It's like a 45, 30 to 50 minute experience where... chat slows down, we can talk about stuff, we can... people write funny shit.
[441:01.90]Easier for me to read it.
[441:02.68]I agree.
[441:09.23]I also love it too.
[441:11.31]And that is gonna be my time.
[441:12.31]I will see you guys...
[441:16.59]Next week.
[441:17.91]On Tuesday.
[441:20.83]No, no, no, not Tuesday.
[441:21.53]Wait.
[441:22.09]Saturday.
[441:24.03]Today's Saturday, right?
[441:24.86]Yeah, okay.
[441:25.44]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[441:27.08]Tuesday the 14th.
[441:29.70]Get some rest.
[441:32.64]We... Next week we've got more Sam and Max to do.
[441:36.00]We're gonna do some more MS-DOS games.
[441:38.08]And I'm gonna throw in something that we haven't done.
[441:41.36]We've been doing a lot of, um...
[441:44.76]the last, like, four or five streams.
[441:47.36]I've been doing a lot of, uh, continuation of series, like Dreams, Sam & Max.
[441:52.61]So, I might throw in something else.
[441:56.25]Kind of like the Labo.
[441:58.85]Well, I'm not gonna do the Labo, but, like, something like that, where it's not like a series.
[442:04.54]But, take care of yourselves.
[442:05.90]See you Tuesday.
[442:07.28]Take care, everybody.
[442:07.80]Thank you for watching.
[442:09.64]Have a great rest of your evening and a great rest of your weekend.
[442:14.05]I'm going to raid Vinny.
[442:17.19]Let's do stream legends and then we're going to raid Vinny.
[442:20.95]Tell him happy birthday from the Germamites.
[442:25.92]And let's do stream legends too while we're at it.
[442:34.48]Oh, I can't.
[442:36.08]It hasn't been 24 hours since my last stream.
[442:41.79]And I'm about to go grocery shopping, so I'm definitely gonna forget when I get back to do that.
[442:47.11]So, if I remember, I'll do it.
[442:50.28]If not, then I'll try to remember.
[442:54.92]Happy birthday, Vinny.
[442:57.38]Raid.
[442:58.12]What the fuck is going on?
[443:00.26]Raid.
[443:03.18]Vinesauce.
[443:06.00]Take it easy, guys.
[443:10.96]See you Tuesday.
[443:12.94]Tata for now.
[443:42.17]you
