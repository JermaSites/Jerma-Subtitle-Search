[04:02.59]I don't want to go.
[04:04.27]I don't want to go.
[04:16.44]I'm not sure how to react to this one.
[05:01.79]All right, so I woke up on the side of the road
[05:13.32]That's it.
[05:13.54]Alright.
[05:14.06]That was B versus Omega Germa.
[05:15.72]It is another Undertale reference.
[05:19.86]Bring on the Undertale.
[05:25.17]Wait, is it gonna go... Here it comes.
[05:34.00]By the way, if you haven't played the anime Undertale, it's, uh... Just be careful, because this is a spoiler for that show.

[06:02.95]Holy fuck.

[07:46.88]Me and Mr. Flynn are the same size, okay?
[07:49.88]I was pushing my fucking knees down and leaning forward.
[07:54.54]This picture is the reason for the internet calling me a small guy.
[07:58.28]And I'm small.
[07:59.08]I am a small guy.
[08:00.24]But not that small.
[08:01.09]Me and Mr. Flynn are the same size.
[08:02.29]Ask him.
[08:04.93]He's a great guy.
[08:06.85]He's a fucking swell guy, by the way.
[08:19.01]Total Maniac tries to break down your door and the situation escalates extremely fast.
[08:30.92]When do I try to break in?
[09:09.45]You'd think he would have attempted by now.
[10:07.76]Because the Jerma invades Vinesauce, by the way.
[10:11.06]Vinny and I actually played... We didn't actually play it.
[10:13.46]We tried to play Red Dead 2 Online last night.
[10:16.06]Didn't work out.

[10:17.40]Vinesauce.

[10:20.54]So you guys see what's happening with Jerma?
[10:30.59]What's happening with Jerma?

[11:40.98]There are no bees!
[11:50.05]Why does everybody use this?
[11:52.01]It doesn't have to be in every side.
[11:56.38]Speed racer.
[11:57.20]Derma.
[11:57.88]Derma's green screen stream.
[12:08.88]Your son seems to be interested in only one thing.
[12:15.05]All he talks about.
[12:18.83]all he seems capable of thinking about... is automobile racing.
[12:32.71]Racing's everything.
[12:33.91]For my family, it isn't just a sport.
[12:36.01]It's way more important than that.
[12:37.47]It's like a religion.
[12:39.51]Are you ready to become a real race car driver?
[12:41.99]Then sign that contract!
[12:44.01]He's just trying to scare your son.
[12:45.49]What you do behind the wheel of a race car...
[12:52.10]You walk away from me, you walk away from this deal, no matter how well you drive, you won't win, you won't place.
[12:57.28]I guarantee you right now, you won't even finish the race.
[12:59.94]You think you can drive a car and change the world?
[13:02.74]It doesn't work like that.
[13:03.96]Maybe not.
[13:05.66]Why is it so deep?
[13:06.04]It's the only thing I know how to do, and I gotta do something.
[13:09.58]Move it, Speed.
[13:15.79]It's getting ugly out there.
[13:26.29]Wasn't my idea.
[13:27.37]Oh, no?
[13:28.47]It was his.
[13:30.23]Oh, it's me.
[13:30.61]It was mine.
[13:39.05]He's going to be very good.
[13:40.88]No, he's going to be the best.
[13:42.66]If they don't destroy him first.
[13:48.46]That's pretty good.
[13:50.74]Pretty good.
[13:51.18]The Gervatrix has you.
[13:52.28]Look at that.
[13:55.90]You have to let it all go, Neo.
[13:57.98]Fear, doubt, and disbelief.
[14:02.60]Free your mind.
[14:13.39]Whoa.
[14:15.01]Hey, can you get me a hand down here?
[14:18.13]That's like a 400-foot jump.
[14:20.95]I guess I'll give it a try.
[14:22.33]No, no, don't worry about me.
[14:26.97]But what if he makes it?
[14:27.63]No one's ever made the first jump.
[14:29.67]I know, I know.
[14:32.07]But what if he does?
[14:33.10]He won't.
[14:35.12]Come on.
[14:36.42]Yes, yes, yes.
[14:37.66]It's my fucking name now.
[14:39.60]It's what I'm going to call him.
[14:41.64]I'll show you.
[14:42.08]I know, I know.
[14:42.96]I was born this.

[15:09.06]Tiny.
[15:09.76]It ain't the size of the fucking ocean, it's how much motion is in that ocean.

[27:44.69]My name's Greg.
[27:45.47]I'm your digital guide.
[27:47.37]As you see here, here's your viewing screen.
[27:50.56]This screen right here is going to show you some of your favorite videos, from Gundam style all the way to your grandma outer fishing trip.
[27:59.18]This is right here.
[28:00.18]This is your space.
[28:01.61]Down here, you've got the light button.
[28:04.43]Oh, it's back.
[28:07.06]If you don't like a piece of content, ooh, thumbs down.
[28:10.52]That's over there.
[28:12.02]On this side, they're going to keep up with me here.
[28:15.83]Here's the subscribe button.
[28:17.67]And if you like a content enough to want to subscribe and potentially lose... I'm going to have to take a week off after this.
[28:24.37]Because we don't do that anymore.
[28:25.81]You have to click a bell.
[28:26.83]The bell's over here, by the way.
[28:28.23]Click that bell right there.
[28:29.83]And then click another couple of buttons, and then maybe you'll be able to see the content you subscribe to.
[28:34.19]This is your space.
[28:37.35]This is it right here.
[28:45.29]I had to remember that.
[28:55.95]Not another T-pose.
[28:57.59]It's too small.
[29:00.03]Small?
[29:01.73]Please, Ed.
[29:03.25]It's compact.

[29:12.68]This is from Shrek.
[29:14.16]Oh my goodness, okay.
[29:34.79]Have you ever seen Shrek?
[29:36.19]It's at the end.
[29:37.51]Hey, Shrek, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[29:39.63]Listen to me.
[29:40.59]Look, you love this woman, don't you?

[29:43.28]Yes.
[29:43.80]Please?
[29:44.52]Yes.
[29:44.96]Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness.
[29:48.88]The chicks love that romantic crap.
[29:50.30]All right, cut it out.
[29:51.58]When does this guy say the line?
[29:54.30]We got to check it out.
[29:56.66]This is just, we're just watching the end of Shrek.
[30:04.70]This is just copyright infringement.
[30:06.60]I'm gonna lose everything.
[30:10.46]I don't care.
[30:13.12]Fuck this job.
[30:15.90]I need to talk to you.
[30:16.96]Oh, now you wanna talk?
[30:18.86]Well, it's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me.
[30:21.48]But you can't marry him!
[30:45.96]I don't want to watch the end of Shrek on my stream, okay?
[30:52.86]Dude, I don't even know.

[33:08.08]Oh, I hate that I did that.
[33:10.25]Every day of my life.
[33:11.21]That was great.
[33:12.11]Thanks for that one.
[33:36.31]Here comes something of a scientist myself.
[33:39.09]I can't even hear it.
[33:47.38]What?
[33:58.57]All right, it's called Germa Sans, another Undertale or Deltarune reference coming up shortly.

[34:18.97]Do you eat ass?
[34:43.52]Sorry, old lady.
[34:45.40]This is why I never make promises.

[35:29.39]You better be ready!
[35:30.65]Here it comes!
[35:31.69]Five eight, not five six.
[35:37.25]Alright, count it.
[35:37.81]How many world explosions has that been from Rat Movie?
[35:40.55]That's at least eight.
[35:41.23]Good use of the explosion.
[36:01.58]If you haven't seen Rat Movie 2, or Rat Movie 1, Mystery of the Mayan Treasure, if you're into animated movies that are less than 8 minutes long, I recommend you don't watch it.
[36:11.69]But if you do, there's a spoiler here, the aliens did it.
[36:16.88]Whoa!
[36:18.18]Hey, it's me, Jerma, and you're watching the Disney Channel.

[42:36.94]Because that's pretty damn cool.
[42:42.36]Of the Raptors.
[42:44.24]Of course.
[42:51.50]Well, that was... That was one of the coolest fucking things ever.
[42:56.16]Germa and what Hollywood... Wait, hold on.
[42:58.79]Germa and what Hollywood has mostly become in the animation industry.
[43:03.25]Okay.
[43:03.41]Okay.
[43:07.30]Whatever that means.
[43:11.42]It's a very compressed video.
[43:13.91]It's so fucking loud.
[43:15.15]I saved the world right there.
[43:16.27]I just saved the world.
[43:17.09]That was too loud for me.
[43:36.45]What's next?
[43:37.15]Spot the Dinosaur.
[43:38.11]Yeah, we're playing Spot the Dinosaur.
[43:40.34]You need to really look and find them.
[43:42.42]They're hidden all over the place.
[43:44.80]Check it out over there to the right.
[43:46.18]You might be able to find one.
[43:55.72]Garfield's cart.
[43:57.70]Coming up next.
[43:59.84]I'm not even facing the right way.
[44:02.66]It's the wrong direction.
[44:09.72]That's it.
[44:10.06]No, not my fucking old intro.
[44:20.60]Not the old intro.
[44:21.36]Don't pull one of those on me here.
[44:39.60]What the hell is this?
[44:40.56]Is this from a movie or a TV show?
[44:48.49]You're my guy right there.
[44:58.62]Tommy?
[45:01.02]Tommy?
[45:38.84]I think that was Halloween.
[45:39.62]Hey, fellas!
[45:41.40]Here, take some stuff!
[45:43.70]You got something to say?
[45:47.64]Fucking idiot.

[46:29.79]Quality.
[46:31.17]That was high quality.
[46:32.09]Man of spiel.
[46:32.95]That's the first thing I say.
[46:34.19]Another man of... Oh, first of all, hold on a minute.
[46:35.63]This is a second Man of Steel trailer.
[46:38.81]This is two.
[46:41.57]Second... Here we go.
[46:43.74]Man of... Man of Steel.
[46:45.40]I look at the ceiling and I go, yo, Merry Christmas!
[46:49.28]And then I diarrhea every single morning.
[46:59.09]Good shoe tie.
[47:00.09]Good use.
[47:33.85]It always has to be a T pose, it's really important.
[47:46.12]Is that it?
[47:50.84]Is there more?
[47:53.48]That's it.
[48:00.30]Beanbag Sonic Tribute.
[48:19.46]Oh, you get fucking Garfield out of here.
[48:22.79]Trying to get me sued?
[48:45.57]What the fuck is that on the left?
[48:48.21]Why is Thanos?
[48:50.02]Wait, what is this?
[48:51.24]What's going on?
[48:51.58]Why is Thanos twerking?
[48:53.72]Where did you get this?
[48:54.44]Did you make this?
[48:57.44]Why is this here?
[49:08.97]Jerma watches TV.
[49:11.25]Yeah, you trying to get me in trouble here?
[49:13.16]Two Garfields in a row.
[49:14.40]Really?
[49:16.87]This is by far, this is the best part right here.
[49:23.35]This is my favorite part.
[49:25.79]This is the best part.
[49:27.93]Stop talking, this is the best part.
[49:31.17]Nice.
[49:34.61]Not even fucking.
[49:40.15]This is terrible.
[49:43.34]Absolutely terrible.
[49:46.33]Nothing about this is good.
[49:48.14]Not one thing.
[49:51.88]God, I hate this.
[49:53.98]I hate this.
[49:54.76]This is terrible.
[49:56.76]No, there's your 45th JoJo reference.
[50:00.80]What's next?
[50:02.18]What a gamer.
[50:02.72]That's not even me playing.
[50:04.83]What a god of a gamer.
[50:06.51]Seriously.
[50:06.93]That's not even me playing.
[50:10.37]Derma fucks up.
[50:32.79]An alternate timeline is created with Jerma... Hold on, wait.
[50:36.54]This is a mouthful.
[50:38.06]An alternate timeline is created where Jerma replaces Banjo and Kazooie for some reason.
[50:44.19]Then Diddy and Dixie, Dixie and Kitty, Mario and Yoshi.
[50:47.11]Okay, okay, you get the point.
[50:48.49]So what's the big deal?
[50:49.85]Well, listen up, because there's a new dynamic duo from the creators of Donkey Kong Country and Goldeneye that's ready to kick some serious excitement into Nintendo 64.
[50:59.70]It's Dirtball, the coolest head-banging, beak-busting, sky-flying, rock-hopping, egg-chipping tag team and duo in a new game with so many thrills, chills, spills, and splats, you won't be able to put it down.
[51:19.06]You know, when you've had enough.
[51:26.94]Peter.
[51:28.06]No, not another Peter.
[51:30.55]Peter, I'm sorry, I'm a scientist myself.
[51:34.75]Not another Peter.
[51:35.77]Peter.
[51:37.69]Peter.
[51:42.46]You're a scientist.
[51:45.12]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[51:47.36]I read all your research on nanotechnology.
[51:49.52]Really brilliant.
[51:50.28]No, I find myself to be something of a scientist myself.
[51:52.84]What?
[51:53.24]I live with my aunt and uncle.
[51:54.50]Peter, I hear you bite the scientist.
[51:58.05]Well, I'm something of a scientist myself.
[52:06.31]Get that in a fucking petri dish, motherfucker!
[52:14.84]We already saw one of these!
[52:22.22]This one has music!
[52:23.14]That's it.
[52:38.13]Hey, it's me, Germo, from Disney Channel.
[52:41.19]Downtown of Center Sports, you're watching the Disney Channel.
[52:52.29]Harry Potter is dead!
[52:56.69]Wait!
[52:57.05]If you haven't seen Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry, there's a potential death here that you don't want to be spoiled of.
[53:02.61]Just be aware of that.
[53:15.36]Stupid boy!
[53:57.98]Presto.
[54:00.39]Majesto.
[54:02.33]Are they gone?
[54:09.69]Don't forget about me, the newest German, Socrates.
[54:13.12]My trusty current player.
[54:14.60]I slash those bunnies like nobody's business.
[54:18.12]Check me out.
[54:19.16]You'll see a little bit of footage right here.
[54:38.97]There was too many things in that one.
[54:41.71]You didn't even key out the green cloak.
[54:46.03]It didn't work.
[54:48.63]Oh man.
[55:01.86]My God.
[55:02.94]Okay.
[55:05.20]German is a filthy act at a fair and reasonable price.
[55:10.85]This is probably the spoiler for JoJo's Funny Land, whatever it is.
[55:13.89]Expelliarmus!
[55:16.55]Expelliarmus!
[55:18.51]Quick!
[55:19.12]Hagrid!
[55:19.78]Get under!

[55:32.58]Doja!
[55:34.80]Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of Germacraft.
[55:40.30]The series where I play Minecraft.
[55:42.50]This is gonna be a single- You got me, partner.
[55:55.85]Knock knock.
[55:57.71]Who's there?
[56:01.45]Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?
[56:03.26]Put this guy in a body bag, he's dead.
[56:11.04]Intense and powerful.
[56:16.70]Wow.
[56:16.98]It sucks.
[56:19.72]It sucks.
[56:21.08]I never thought that I would be winning this award.
[56:25.83]Unbelievable.
[56:27.55]Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart,
[56:30.91]Thank you for all of your support and for all of your wonderful contributions.
[56:38.44]I must say, it's been quite a year.
[56:42.70]Quite a year, in fact, that I've got two more games to announce.
[56:47.62]That's right, two more games.
[56:51.23]With the most ingenuity and the highest caliber of skill that any of our developers have ever done, it is my pleasure
[57:01.33]to announce our latest title.
[57:17.46]What the hell was that?
[57:23.37]What was that?
[57:24.61]What video game was that?
[57:29.11]All right, here's talking streamers once in a lifetime.
[57:37.81]All right, add that to the list of streamers that get permanently banned from the platform.
[57:53.74]Okay.
[57:58.43]And here we go, Jerma drifts into the void.
[58:31.41]No.
[58:31.77]No.
[59:00.21]Oddly peaceful this one is.
[59:08.93]And there I go.
[59:09.65]That's it.
[59:12.81]I think that's the end of the video.
[59:15.05]This is Don't Give In.
[59:16.89]I'm not giving in to the dabbing.
[59:18.53]It's not gonna... No, no, no.
[59:21.49]No, turn it up.
[59:22.59]Turn it up.
[59:23.29]I'm not giving in to the dabbing.
[59:24.69]Turn it up.
[59:25.49]Oh, my fucking God.
[59:26.45]Fine.
[59:26.81]Ready?
[59:27.05]Oh, no.
[59:33.33]Thank god he saved me.
[59:37.15]Dav.exe has stopped working.

[61:38.75]It's hard!
[61:40.25]It's time for me to lose my hair.
[61:43.17]This battle is about to explode.

[62:28.03]Surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.
[62:35.56]I thought that was me making noises for a second.
[62:37.86]No, that's just R2-D2.
[62:39.32]Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.
[62:43.08]And where you come from.
[62:44.48]Did you hear that?
[63:15.85]What?
[63:22.41]What was that?
[63:40.19]Is this Jojo?

[64:10.94]Derma the Creeper.
[64:21.64]Can you see?
[64:25.29]I'm spying on myself playing Minecraft.

[65:28.62]There he goes.
[65:29.44]Stop him.
[65:30.52]Do what you can.
[65:35.10]No!
[65:50.24]That's it.
[65:50.56]That's going to be it.
[65:52.34]That's it.
[65:53.50]The winner of the 2008... Wait, if you haven't seen a television before, if you've never had a TV before, there's a television spoiler here at the end of this video.
[66:00.03]Team Rumble is the green screen.
[66:01.19]It's been a long time, dude.
[66:03.47]That was so long.
[66:04.25]It was like number what?
[66:05.99]Like 11 or 12 or something?
[66:07.09]It's been the whole time.
[66:10.19]Angered by his victory, German made a new Rumble, but a green screen can't win.
[66:15.08]We know what happened.
[66:16.16]All right, come on.
[66:17.48]Here comes the green screen.
[66:18.42]The green screen's stuck on the rope.
[66:26.98]this is very key what no are like microsoft now you microsoft

[66:56.80]Strongest competitors.

[66:59.16]We're just watching God's Earth.
[67:03.68]Oh, what a reversal.
[67:04.34]Here it comes.
[67:06.88]No, no.
[67:07.42]Reversal.
[67:09.40]All he needed was this.
[67:10.42]Was that going to be enough?
[67:12.66]One, two, three.
[67:15.52]Super Jex.
[67:17.24]That was lame.
[67:18.79]Nice job, Super Jex.
[67:21.55]Hey, can you give me a hand down here?
[67:23.67]That's like a 400-foot jump.
[67:25.42]I guess I'll give it a try.
[67:27.06]No, no, don't worry about me.
[67:29.65]Two, three.
[67:32.81]All right, great.
[67:46.38]Yo, Jermbo.
[68:11.17]This is- I'm doing a Dark Souls thing.
[68:12.71]This is out of context.
[68:13.89]You got something to say?
[68:28.47]Oh, look at me!
[68:29.25]Look at me!
[68:32.95]Look at me!
[68:33.93]Look at me!
[68:43.53]That's it.
[68:45.33]A man terrified of apples attempts to conquer his fear.
[68:49.47]I can't do it.
[68:54.94]I can't do it.
[68:55.72]I can't do it.
[69:06.98]This is very creative.
[69:18.84]By the way, that's a tomato on the right.
[69:20.38]That's not even an apple, that's a tomato.
[69:37.15]Of course I explode.
[69:38.03]Derma goes to the movies.
[69:39.33]Derma goes to the movies.
[69:44.69]This is by far, this is the best part right here.
[69:51.19]This is my favorite part.
[69:52.91]This is the best part.
[69:54.87]Nice.
[69:55.09]This is terrible.
[69:57.56]Absolutely terrible.
[70:11.20]Nothing about this is good.
[70:13.20]Not one thing.
[70:13.62]Shut up.
[70:15.26]Why is this guy doing this?
[70:18.68]God, I hate this.
[70:19.62]I hate this.
[70:20.20]This is terrible.
[70:21.34]Now, this is show business.
[70:39.80]What an annoying fucking person.
[70:42.46]What?
[70:43.94]What the fuck is that?
[70:45.64]Hey, how'd he get down there?
[71:04.45]Wow.
[71:06.27]This is what it looks like up close.
[71:10.05]From back there, I could have seen.
[71:12.59]Hey, yo, dude.
[71:13.61]What are you doing down there?
[71:15.07]Hey, get out of the way.
[71:20.52]Sir.
[71:21.04]You're in front of the screen.
[71:22.42]Excuse me, sir.
[71:24.70]Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to come with me tomorrow.
[71:27.66]Oh, Jay, get him out of here.
[71:37.68]Oh, wait, wait.
[71:43.06]What a fucking like megalomaniac.
[71:53.65]Turn this off and turn the lights in your house off too.
[71:55.93]Okay.
[72:03.30]We are at less than 100, I believe, videos remaining.
[72:12.36]I just need a minute here.
[72:15.28]Less than 100.
[72:16.72]We're almost there.
[72:24.54]That last one was fucking hysterical.
[72:28.82]They've all been fucking great, but my goodness.
[72:30.99]Okay.
[72:35.20]Let's go back to it.
[72:35.86]This is called Germa, This Isn't Real.
[72:41.35]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[72:56.07]We didn't know what was going through Jeremy's mind, but by that point we didn't want to know.
[73:03.78]Jeremy Elbertson, earlier this year, was tried for the infamous Father Christmas killings.
[73:12.72]After the overwhelming evidence supported by the polygraph test, as well as the incident that transpired, he was sent to court to finalise the guilty verdict.
[73:25.01]However, during the hearing, his confession brought to light information that changed everything.
[73:33.36]He said, If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[73:37.60]After that, it was clear this man was an insane person, and so he was sent to an asylum for psychiatric evaluation.
[73:46.54]We discovered that he was in his own little world, talking to an imaginary audience.
[73:52.21]We tried to make contact, but he just kept spouting nonsense.
[73:56.87]He kept saying Presto Majesto over and over.
[74:00.69]He spoke in pure binary.
[74:05.61]List goes on.
[74:07.57]No progress was made.
[74:10.09]There was only one instance where he stopped talking to himself and actually responded to us.
[74:17.28]During one of our interviews, he told us this.
[74:21.29]Jacques Pepin is my favorite.
[74:23.75]He is!
[74:24.17]We're still trying to decipher what that even meant.
[74:28.25]It's the best chef, best celebrity chef ever!
[74:31.69]It's 80!
[74:36.53]And that's where we wake up.
[74:37.63]The JermaRaptor exhibit.
[74:43.01]Wow.
[74:45.55]Wow.
[74:47.74]What the fuck is that?
[74:56.92]What is that supposed to be?
[74:59.36]What is that supposed to be?
[75:01.31]That's a 3D render?
[75:16.92]This Halloween testing one two three we're on We're here to investigate a patient that killed three innocent teenagers on Halloween in 1978 That was good He was shot by his own psychiatrist That night and spent the last 40 years in captivity and
[75:44.73]If you know that, I pray every night that he would escape.
[75:48.53]What the hell did you do that for?
[75:52.96]So I can kill him.
[75:55.14]I hate you more than that one.
[75:58.46]Try another.
[75:59.28]From John.
[76:03.57]The bus crashed.
[76:04.27]Mom, what bus crashed?
[76:07.01]Michael escaped.
[76:14.91]I got good dental.
[76:16.37]Yeah, I got good dental.
[76:17.29]He's waited for this night.
[76:18.71]He's waited for me.
[76:19.35]I've waited for him.
[76:20.01]Get out the lawn!
[76:20.81]Get inside!
[76:47.77]he's here michael don't look at the screen you should can you close the closet door surprise
[77:20.37]The creativity involved is just mind-boggling.
[77:23.35]This is called Bad Japple.
[77:26.01]This is an Apple commercial.
[77:46.41]those dancing Apple commercials right the iPod it's gonna say iPod at the very end iPod
[78:25.33]This is a JoJo reference?
[78:28.85]Oh, okay.
[78:53.85]Not a JoJo reference.
[78:54.99]Oh, okay.
[78:55.41]I thought it was JoJo.
[78:57.51]Well, a lot of work went into this one.
[79:00.07]This one is very well made.
[79:01.77]Obligatory.
[79:02.63]This looks really stupid.
[79:22.89]I'm in first person just behind you.
[79:25.63]And it looks like... It looks like one of those old 80s movies.
[79:29.69]Where the guy... You're in front of like a green screen.
[79:31.73]And you're like apparently driving right now.
[79:34.90]Oh, wow.
[79:35.26]Look out.
[79:35.64]This looks really great on my fucking green screen.
[79:38.94]Oh, I get it.
[79:40.10]I get it.
[79:40.74]That's a meta joke.
[79:42.76]Okay, I was wondering what the hell was going on there.
[79:45.99]Makes sense.
[79:47.33]Good job.
[79:49.01]Good work.
[79:50.73]German does MVN.
[79:59.63]And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[80:02.95]With my trusty Curve Blade, I slash those putties like nobody's business.
[80:08.09]Is that putties?
[80:10.70]That's Power Rangers, right?
[80:11.94]Did I get that wrong?
[80:14.22]Alright, that's it.
[80:15.68]Here comes the weather.
[80:18.62]You know, typically I bring you the weather on a daily basis at 6am.
[80:24.76]6am in the morning with Diane, Carol, and Rick.
[80:29.31]But today, I want to show you something different.
[80:32.24]Besides the fact that, first, be aware, we are going to have some snow over here in the Colorado Rockies coming through here down into the southern part of Colorado.
[80:43.28]But forget that.
[80:45.47]I want to show you something that I care about.
[80:47.33]Something that I want to show that I haven't had an opportunity to do until now.
[80:56.73]That's me on my fishing trip.
[80:59.62]That's me and my son.
[81:00.78]Yeah.
[81:05.15]I just wanted to show it.
[81:10.07]There we are.
[81:12.59]And back to the weather.
[81:13.24]We do have, like I said, some cold.
[81:17.40]Ron, who cares about this?
[81:18.62]America, go out and live your lives.
[81:24.03]Don't worry about the weather.
[81:25.55]You just go outside and sniff.
[81:27.47]You'll be just fine.
[81:29.24]It's going to be cold some days.
[81:30.62]It's going to be hot some days.
[81:31.76]It's just, just go out there.
[81:34.76]Go out there and... What the fuck?
[81:44.79]I love music class because... What is the Fred movie?
[81:48.07]That's the park car.
[81:48.99]That's the park right there.
[81:52.59]How do I skip it?
[81:53.89]This is terrible.
[81:54.25]Absolutely terrible.
[81:54.81]Nothing.
[81:55.73]Not one thing.
[81:57.92]God, I hate this.
[82:01.04]This is derma dark soul.
[82:31.29]That's it, that's it, that's the end.
[82:34.96]I can't skip it.
[82:37.48]There's a context here.
[82:38.36]Hold on.
[82:38.64]Just wait.
[82:39.00]Shut up, everybody.
[82:39.60]Shut up, everybody.
[82:40.18]Shut up for a second.
[82:41.38]There's context behind this.
[82:43.50]This is... I... Somebody... I had... Back on YouTube... Back on YouTube, there was a joke where I was going to get in a bathtub and make, like, a duck face and do... This is not... I don't do this on, like, Saturday.
[82:54.64]I don't think this is cool.
[82:56.48]There's a lot of new people here.
[82:58.26]This was a bet.
[82:58.78]It was a bet that I would get in the bathtub and do this, and it was a star that took the photo and then uploaded it, and I didn't want them to.
[83:04.00]On the bottom right here.
[83:07.69]Those of you that have televisions, spoiler for the four years ago German 95 channel.
[83:14.18]Just in case you were curious, I want to make sure there's no reverse spoilers here.
[83:17.04]I told you guys this before.
[83:20.38]Absolute perfection.
[83:22.86]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[83:25.03]This right here is absolute perfection.
[83:28.99]I can't skip it.
[83:29.51]I'm not allowed to.
[83:34.81]I think we're getting to the home stretch here.
[83:36.34]German tours.
[83:40.27]What is this?
[83:41.30]This is Disney ride.
[83:45.04]This is a Disneyland ride.
[84:12.38]Do you want to sing a car song?
[84:17.58]I don't either.
[84:20.18]Here's another raptor.
[84:21.84]Coming up.
[84:24.04]Germtastic Park.
[84:25.86]Mom, I see it.
[84:54.86]That doesn't make any sense.
[85:05.34]It's a compact streamer.
[85:09.09]Ugh.
[85:38.98]End of germ- I can't even respond.
[85:46.62]What- what is this?
[85:54.25]This is a- just turn off your screen.
[85:55.95]Just delete your computer.
[85:57.33]Throw it out the window.
[86:01.08]I'm not gonna- I- A lonely Sunday drive.
[86:23.49]Careful!
[86:25.03]Ah!
[86:39.53]The fucking car I don't
[87:16.17]matches with the wheels somehow.
[87:22.07]That's a bad screamer.
[87:23.29]Oh my god.
[87:46.05]Okay, according to German, the hamburger helper is perfection.
[87:55.56]Hamburger helper?
[87:56.10]I don't know, that's a hamburger helper's face.
[87:58.02]That's not the hamburger helper's face.
[88:15.60]Is it?
[88:17.28]No, it's not.
[88:17.94]Ah, this germ isolation.
[88:19.29]So, I guess you need to explore in this game.
[88:21.45]There was a crash.
[88:22.47]Oh, no.
[88:22.87]I need to investigate the mystery of the crash, which is what I plan on doing.
[88:28.42]Let's go ahead and go.
[88:31.66]Oh, fuck.
[88:33.46]That's him.
[88:34.50]Can I get away without him seeing?
[88:35.62]That's the main thing that's gotta be here.
[88:37.82]No, no, he's right behind me.
[88:39.02]He's right behind me.
[88:39.56]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[88:41.08]If I can make it up these stairs, please.
[88:43.70]It's an alien.
[88:45.14]It's a fucking alien.
[88:46.40]Hey.
[88:47.66]Where is he?
[88:49.66]Where'd he go?
[88:55.06]How did I make the original?
[88:57.09]Uh, a lot of time.
[88:58.97]This is an awful video, apparently.
[89:11.69]Why are they always purple?
[89:12.81]I didn't want to knock you out, but I did.
[89:41.18]You should have gone for the head.
[89:46.78]I'm gonna do it with two hands and everyone dies.
[89:54.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:55.17]That means me too.
[89:56.13]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:57.29]No, that means me.
[90:00.33]Count it again.
[90:01.23]There it is again.
[90:01.79]This is the earth exploding.
[90:05.67]Counting, that's like 12.
[90:11.08]Alright, here comes, why did I make this the second?
[90:19.25]This is Parappa the Rapper.
[90:44.58]Rex, we are the Rex.
[90:46.38]Rex, Rex, we are the Rex.
[90:49.38]Rex, we are the Rex.
[90:51.13]Steal the target.
[90:52.37]Steal the target.
[90:53.53]Steal the target.
[90:54.69]Steal the target.
[90:55.89]Steal the target.
[90:57.07]Steal the target.
[90:58.95]Rex, we are the Rex.
[91:00.51]Rex, Rex, we are the Rex.
[91:02.60]That's referential right there.
[91:04.36]We are the Rex.
[91:05.56]Pick up eggs.
[91:19.70]was good I don't understand
[91:48.76]I don't know what- This is from a TV show, I think.
[91:51.26]Look at what I'm doing.
[92:03.32]Zoom in closer.
[92:05.09]Do you understand?
[92:06.41]You understand like what- Look at my knees.
[92:08.27]I'm bending forward.
[92:11.09]Complete- Look at these bent knees.
[92:12.47]Look at my arm.
[92:13.07]My arm doesn't come down to my shins, guys.
[92:15.89]Are you kidding me?
[92:22.84]Do you understand what's happening here?
[92:25.20]Do you really think that my left arm is a foot off the ground?
[92:29.73]Do you really think that?
[92:32.03]Look at the ground.
[92:34.15]You think that my hand comes down like a fucking gorilla?
[93:07.65]of that.
[93:21.14]Say goodbye to the fucking font.
[93:24.38]The font is gone.
[93:25.75]Font was deleted probably an hour ago.
[93:38.49]Grandma Bond versus Socrates.
[93:42.70]Oh my fucking god.
[93:45.54]He actually made Socrates.
[93:47.02]That's so loud.
[93:59.25]Was it that loud when we taped it?
[94:10.67]It was that loud?
[94:11.65]I'm like a shitty boss from, like, an anime.
[94:17.73]Gameplay.
[94:19.96]Damn you.
[94:59.92]What the fuck is that?
[95:01.16]I have, um, these.
[95:03.77]Spaghettios micros.
[95:07.01]Um, I'm gonna microwave these and I'm going to eat them.
[95:10.01]Oh no, no, please!
[95:11.77]Oh my god!
[95:12.35]Wish me luck.
[95:14.39]Okay, it's nuclear hot.
[95:16.64]It's got a soupy consistency.
[95:19.91]Like this is not what pasta is supposed to be like.
[95:22.19]It's supposed to be like 75% pasta and like 25% sauce.
[95:30.92]Maybe more than that, maybe more sauce, but this is like soup and it's not appetizing.
[95:38.51]It does not look appetizing.
[95:41.01]So I'm afraid and it's really hot and I don't like the implications of this.
[95:51.94]Here goes.
[95:52.42]You made it!
[95:57.08]I made Vinny.
[95:57.58]Go fuck yourself!
[96:04.19]No.
[96:11.31]German falls out his window.
[96:12.47]Oh, shit.
[96:17.19]Oh.
[96:18.95]Oh.
[96:25.90]Why is it taking so long?
[97:06.74]What is that?
[97:11.90]Oh, shit, it worked.
[97:17.42]Well, if two in the hand is worth one in the bush.
[97:21.34]I feel fine.
[97:22.63]Looks like this guy went shush.
[97:34.39]Finally, it only took...
[97:36.71]It only took, hold on, it only took 284 videos before somebody decided to do the Horatio.
[97:52.68]And here comes another Sans video.
[97:54.90]Hope you're ready for this one.
[98:18.02]Fortnite is number one, I've never said that before.
[98:43.41]Should be burning in hell.
[98:45.63]Alright, this one's pretty good!
[98:56.72]Oh, that's it.
[98:59.46]Bloodborne boss fight.
[99:07.46]That's my favorite character in the game, by the way.
[99:09.44]Good choice of clip.
[99:12.26]Oh, the gas coin is my favorite character in Bloodborne.
[99:15.36]You caught on?
[99:35.31]He doesn't have a gun!
[99:38.17]Why do I have a gun?
[99:45.17]No, don't turn into the raptor, he's gonna... Whatever the raptor... That was fucking good.
[100:17.88]That's the onion guy?
[100:19.14]Onion man?
[100:23.25]What a gamer.
[100:26.01]What a god of a gamer, seriously.
[100:29.05]Uh, what?
[100:29.43]I don't understand.
[100:40.90]Did you kill him?
[100:48.77]I think it's time to blow this thing.
[100:50.25]Get everybody in the stuff together.
[100:52.91]Okay.
[100:53.21]This is so creepy.
[101:19.94]This is really good.
[101:43.57]Fucking dance.
[101:45.09]All right.
[102:13.30]Derma's stuck in a vent.
[102:15.81]Look, there's a bird, dude.
[102:16.93]It knows what's good.
[102:17.79]I'm telling you, I just heard it inside.

[103:24.37]Look at me!
[103:25.17]Look at me!

[103:30.99]Oh, I'm sorry!
[103:31.55]I'm sorry!
[103:37.65]No, no, no.
[103:38.13]The Germacraft 2.0.0.
[103:39.03]Here we go.
[103:39.67]Whoa.
[103:51.40]I love how the keys radically change.
[103:53.70]So this is the virtual world.
[103:57.89]It's amazing.
[104:06.07]Fascinating.
[104:12.31]Two hours later.
[104:15.97]Well, I do got a pretty sweet house.
[104:19.32]Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.
[104:22.04]Another Jim Carrey walk.
[104:24.48]Oh, God.
[104:25.24]Oh, no.
[104:35.56]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[104:38.31]No.
[104:40.67]Oh, oh.
[104:42.99]It's everywhere.
[104:51.79]Do I eat ass?
[104:54.01]What are you talking about?
[105:04.53]That's your question?
[105:06.41]You rubbed the fucking lamp.
[105:07.75]You rubbed the lamp and that's what you want to ask the genie?
[105:11.93]Oh great, oh powerful genie, please come out.
[105:14.03]Come out.
[105:17.03]Oh no.
[105:19.53]Honey?
[105:31.20]What is that?
[105:31.56]What is your wish?
[105:39.58]Do you eat ass?
[105:45.26]Of course I do!
[105:55.68]Sucked back in.
[106:00.70]No, no.
[106:01.74]Another intro.
[106:22.50]It took this long to get Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[106:27.31]Evangelion?
[106:28.13]Evangelion?
[106:29.23]How do you pronounce it?
[106:31.75]Evangelion?
[106:52.07]But one day you'll realize that behind your back there are wings that will take you to the distant future.
[107:02.34]The cruel angel's order will soon come out of the window.
[107:11.33]With a hot bat that will blow you away,
[107:30.33]That was pretty good.
[107:31.03]That was pretty damn good.
[107:34.69]Yeah, thank you for making.
[107:35.53]Do you remember the worm?
[107:37.49]This is a penis thing.
[107:53.92]Life is pain!
[107:55.62]Turn it off!
[108:01.78]Turn it off!
[108:03.58]Life's great.
[108:05.60]That was so much going on in this game.
[108:08.14]I don't even know what to say.
[108:10.47]There was so much going on.
[108:12.81]German Ascent.
[108:13.43]I guess I'll give it a try.
[108:14.61]No, no, don't worry about me.
[108:27.37]Nice.
[108:32.92]Where do I ascend to?
[108:42.36]Okay, this ends with the earth blowing up.
[108:50.14]The earth better not explode in this one.
[108:54.09]That'd make it like 13 or 14, right?
[109:06.50]What the hell?
[109:06.96]What happened?
[109:07.38]I'm coming back to Earth.
[109:15.66]Apparently.
[109:19.78]You don't need to know what I had for breakfast this morning, alright?
[109:21.99]Just let's talk about the deal.
[109:26.96]It's a different Rat Movie ending.
[109:29.16]Still counts.
[109:29.62]Super Jex.
[109:30.60]Dragon Ball Z.
[110:02.29]Why is it the dog?
[110:06.07]If you've never had an ice cream before, just be aware that, like, this is gonna freeze.
[110:11.43]There's a freeze in here, and you're gonna get brain freeze.
[110:13.48]If you've never eaten ice cream, don't fucking watch this video.

[111:08.66]Super Saiyan here we go We're just watching Dragon Ball Z
[111:54.25]That and that's the whole, you made the whole video.
[111:57.01]The whole video was made to do that.
[111:59.84]That's what the entire video was made to do.
[112:04.36]Too many germs.
[112:11.39]There's too many of them.
[112:13.10]There's too many of them.
[112:53.39]That's not a planet.
[112:54.07]What's that planet?
[112:54.61]I can see the sneakers.
[113:09.54]Why do you have the Disney Channel opening here?
[113:31.55]What?

[116:07.60]Whatever.
[116:09.12]I loved the country and worked hard.
[116:11.82]I was just a young man.
[116:14.84]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[116:16.58]Why am I here?
[116:19.34]Why am I in this?
[116:40.54]No, why craft?
[116:41.68]Don't worry, I'll get it.
[116:48.03]Oh, it's the Ender Dragon!
[116:53.73]I don't know what happened.
[117:03.74]Does the Ender Dragon pick you up?
[117:05.82]Let's take a look, hold on.
[117:11.79]Guys, I just want to let you know, we have about... We have about 50 videos left.
[117:16.25]Until it's done.
[117:16.91]50.
[117:22.34]This is called Norman Osborn.
[117:26.80]Introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
[117:30.52]Great honor to meet you, sir.
[117:32.14]You're a scientist?
[117:34.83]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[117:36.26]Frozen back there.
[117:37.30]I read all your research on nanotechnology.
[117:39.32]Really brilliant.
[117:40.92]Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
[117:44.69]Hey, you two!
[117:45.27]Get that in a fucking tea tree dish, motherfucker!
[117:56.37]They both did the same.
[117:57.90]They both have the same idea.
[117:59.78]All right.
[118:01.86]Let's take one final break before we get the last 40 or 50 here.
[118:09.80]Final break of the evening.

[121:16.28]Here we go.
[121:19.10]World of Germa, a German movie night.
[121:27.15]This is a take on the World of Light trailer from Smash Brothers.
[121:51.96]Why?
[121:52.44]What?
[121:52.66]Don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[122:07.08]I'm not so sure about that one.
[122:10.54]It's going to be a hot one.
[122:11.83]That's right.
[122:31.13]That's my character, so he gets to live!
[122:48.03]Are we gonna get the lyrics here?
[122:49.94]Falling star going through the sky, sir!
[122:53.35]Colors weave into a spire of flame Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed Bear this torch against the cold of the night Search your soul and reawaken the undying soul
[123:19.48]Do you remember if this is the B part 2?
[123:20.64]Apparently this is part 2.
[123:24.37]Whoever wins this 1v1 duel eats the most pizza, and I think it's me.
[123:29.17]Not anymore.
[123:29.99]It's JoJo's fucking bizarre adventures.
[123:47.86]Leave.
[123:48.30]Me.
[123:48.40]The fuck.
[123:48.82]Alone.
[123:49.16]It turned into a bullying campaign.
[123:51.54]Life is pain!
[123:52.04]I hate myself!
[123:53.40]No.
[124:17.11]Let's make this a little interesting.
[124:21.61]It's over.
[124:22.03]Did I kill him?
[124:31.05]I think I just killed this guy.
[124:35.05]Well, you know what they say.
[124:37.75]Smoking is bad.
[124:40.47]They do say that.
[124:41.29]You're right.
[124:45.45]This is fucking awful.
[124:47.11]That was the joke.
[124:48.01]This is fucking terrible.
[124:49.67]This is the worst one ever.
[124:52.03]No, no.
[124:52.57]This is terrible.
[124:55.96]Am I a sim?
[124:59.34]Here comes the reveal trailer for me.
[125:08.74]Coffee.
[125:10.64]Cheetos.
[125:16.40]Of course the chicken.
[125:27.53]Gonna be one of the most professional athletes you've ever seen in this game.
[125:32.09]Nice.
[125:46.31]Life is pain!
[126:14.49]Hey, how about you suck a fart out of my ass?
[126:18.89]Super Smash Brothers!
[126:22.35]Oh no.
[126:22.79]Welcome from Bethesda Game Studios.
[126:25.31]No, no.
[126:26.10]No, no, no, no.
[126:27.24]Todd, Todd, get off.
[126:28.26]No, I don't want to hear fucking Todd Howard speak.
[126:32.36]By the way.
[126:35.80]How we doing?
[126:37.36]What is this?
[126:39.95]That's all right.
[126:40.89]I'm getting the fuck off.
[126:42.03]You're my guy right there.
[126:43.07]I took like a break.
[126:50.83]This video is going to give me a nosebleed.
[126:55.07]That puked.
[127:27.86]There's more Holy shit!
[127:56.32]This is too many clips.
[127:57.14]Thank God.
[127:57.46]This is terrible.
[127:57.94]Absolutely terrible.
[127:58.46]Imagine rendering this.
[127:59.10]It would take you probably three days to render that.
[128:26.15]God, I hate this.
[128:28.33]I hate this.
[128:29.11]This is terrible.
[128:32.47]Can somebody edit this?
[128:36.73]Edit what?
[128:41.25]So I think the thing about, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[128:47.67]Oh shit, hold on, wait.
[128:48.39]Holy shit, there's a button, there's a bee in here.
[128:54.15]Okay, he landed.
[128:58.53]Did you see that?
[129:03.29]Look at these pogchamps.
[129:06.11]That's some dumb shit, yeah.
[129:20.36]That was some pretty dumb shit.
[129:23.22]Jerma is Hitman.
[129:30.02]This is well made.
[130:00.57]Fuck you!
[130:15.92]Oh, I'm taking his disguise.
[130:20.62]That's very clever.
[130:21.24]Aww.
[130:49.53]I'm sorry.
[131:17.35]Oh, god.
[131:18.39]Lost fortress.
[131:19.39]There's a hornet's nest in my wall.
[131:22.61]In my kitchen, in the light outside, there's a nest.
[131:30.36]You're my guy right there.
[131:33.40]Shut the fuck up.
[131:35.52]Wow.
[131:39.08]There are so many of these.
[131:42.58]Being the number one
[131:47.56]Streamer on Twitch.
[131:50.36]It was a dream come true.
[131:52.93]I do got a pretty sweet house.
[131:54.39]Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.
[131:56.69]That's it.
[132:03.01]What a gamer.
[132:03.73]What a god of a gamer.
[132:05.18]Is that Ant Sim?
[132:07.62]We're up in smoke.
[132:08.52]That was Ant Simulator.
[132:13.56]Hold on a second here.
[132:14.58]Wait, there's more?
[132:17.61]I streamed that game for like 25 minutes.
[132:19.75]That game was fucking awful.
[132:21.13]That's still good.
[132:33.26]That just made me hungry.
[132:37.83]I want those so bad right now.
[132:40.25]I would pay a hundred bucks for a box of Cheez-Its right now.
[132:42.77]Attack of the Germs.
[132:47.92]Come on, let's see it.
[132:54.56]Wow.
[132:56.35]I missed the choke.
[133:00.37]Whoa.
[133:06.75]I see him down here.
[133:08.30]Affirmative.
[133:09.22]Continue target take down.
[133:10.66]Watch back.
[133:11.24]Take the target out.
[133:19.88]That's good Attack on Titan
[133:43.51]Look, it's sweaty.
[133:44.53]I know.
[133:45.29]I'm so fucking sweaty.
[133:46.90]Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all of your support.
[133:53.82]And for- Hey, it's been quite a year.
[134:02.04]Quite a year, in fact, that I've got two more games to announce.
[134:09.65]The man from-
[134:20.48]Just checking to see how much is left.
[134:21.90]Boston.
[134:22.72]Okay.
[134:23.56]We are usually next to Rooster Teeth at every convention we go to because we're good friends with them.
[134:30.04]So we like to set it up that we're always next to Rooster Teeth.
[134:33.05]So a kid comes up.
[134:35.55]And he has a poster for Rooster Teeth's new project, Ruby.
[134:39.29]But I sign the poster and the kid comes up.
[134:40.98]He's like, oh, and this kid, he's about this tall.
[134:46.10]That's generous.
[134:48.38]He's about, hey, here's the ground.
[134:50.90]The kid is about this big.
[134:54.25]He's about this wide.
[134:56.89]He's wearing a sweater, whatever, and he's like, hey.
[135:00.74]He talks with a thick Boston accent.
[135:03.12]He's just like, hey, let me ask you guys something.
[135:06.28]If you're Bernie, let me hear you do the voice.
[135:09.63]I walk up to this kid who may or may not murder me and get away with it because he's a child.
[135:14.61]I walk up to him and I go, oh, you want Bernie's voice?
[135:17.69]Yeah, let me, hold on.
[135:23.03]That's not the voice.
[135:23.65]That's not the voice.
[135:26.11]That ain't the fucking voice.
[135:27.83]That's not the voice.
[135:29.52]That's not what it sounds like on the show.
[135:32.60]If you're Bernie, then I got a message for you to take back to Austin with you.
[135:38.88]This is where Rooster Teeth is from, Austin, Texas.
[135:42.00]You tell Gavin that British fuck, he doesn't deserve the achievement from the Minecraft video.
[135:54.62]I have no idea what that was.
[135:57.58]That's it.
[135:57.88]Dermot dances till he's dead.
[135:59.26]Is this one.
[136:23.53]Big dance energy.
[136:39.59]Somebody said, that's enough for tonight.
[136:43.56]It's only like 35 more.
[136:48.58]That's enough for tonight.
[136:51.76]All right, man.
[136:52.24]Like that was, that's fucking good for now, right?
[136:58.82]What the fuck was that?
[137:25.99]Pause it because somebody said I've reached my limit a half an hour ago German
[137:59.36]This is really good.
[138:04.02]What a gamer.
[138:06.36]What a god of a gamer, seriously.
[138:30.89]German Land Saga.
[138:33.51]Another animated television show.
[138:54.05]I've watched more anime intros than I think I ever have in my whole life tonight.
[139:02.51]And yeah, there's another purple Jeremy.
[139:33.96]What's the name of this anime?
[139:38.52]I don't know.
[139:43.12]Super Mario 64 Bowser Hallway.
[139:45.92]That's not the name of the anime.
[139:46.78]That's all I could think of.
[140:01.29]No viewer should have all that.
[140:31.78]Nobody should have all this power.
[140:34.60]I'm sure I'll have work in the morning.
[140:38.44]It's almost done.
[141:04.04]This feels like the end.
[141:05.20]Well, sorry to say, but you've got about 27 more videos to watch.
[141:07.90]Oh, here's another Star Wars one.
[141:28.84]Wait a second.
[141:34.43]They're sand people, all right?
[141:35.37]I can see one of them now.
[141:36.99]What is that?
[141:50.06]In a perfect world, men like me would not exist.
[141:57.08]This is not a perfect world.
[142:07.75]Why is it so dark in here?
[142:10.53]Honey?
[142:12.85]Honey?
[142:20.63]No, dude!
[142:21.73]No.
[142:22.63]No, Trevor!
[142:24.93]What the fuck?
[142:26.79]Wait, hold on a second.
[142:41.00]Hold on, was that... That was just, that was just melee.
[142:51.69]What the fuck was that?
[142:52.69]Alright, this is called Jerma's House Story, plus mining in this one, this JermaCraft video.
[143:01.21]TruckTruck made that video, that's fucking hilarious.
[143:16.50]Well, there we go.
[143:23.08]Guy right there.
[143:24.66]You're my guy right there.
[143:25.64]Where's my guy?
[143:28.89]There he is right there.
[143:30.67]That's my guy.
[143:45.78]One too many cooks.
[143:47.00]This is called germ- germamon.
[143:48.12]That was the baby, okay.
[143:49.68]It's an egg!
[144:16.77]Give me all your eggs.
[144:17.47]What are you talking about?
[144:19.31]I don't have any eggs.
[144:21.03]You leave me no choice.
[144:22.79]Prepare to die.
[144:29.98]Germasaurus versus Floorball Germo.
[144:33.24]Well, this is fucking incredibly well made.
[144:34.88]Throw the ball.
[144:46.24]That's it.
[144:48.35]Baseball, Bat German, Tertibus German, or Thanos German?
[144:56.01]Which one?
[144:56.57]Thanos?
[144:56.97]That's it.
[144:59.51]It's over.
[145:16.78]Oh, my God.
[145:18.96]Alright, man, let's go, let's get him, let's go, let's get him, let's go, let's get him, let's get him.
[145:22.53]Oh, yeah, man, let's fuck him up.
[145:24.53]Shut up, get that door open.
[145:26.35]Yeah, man, I'm gonna keep that door open.
[145:28.69]Oh, God damn it, I gotta do everything myself.
[145:31.45]Alright, German.
[145:32.37]Wait, somebody just made a 3D, this is 3D movie maker.
[145:34.73]Come on, man, just let us go home.
[145:36.65]Half the bar is dead and it's been five hours.
[145:39.57]We have no safe, we have no money, we burned it all last week.
[145:44.78]Please man, just let us go, huh?
[145:47.98]Holy shit.
[145:52.60]You actually put this together?
[145:53.46]Oh fuck, oh shit, oh god damn it.
[146:04.17]Is it gonna end with the world exploding?
[146:05.47]I wonder.
[146:12.19]All right, Gemma, the police are all dead.
[146:14.47]You can walk away free now.
[146:24.54]What?
[146:28.04]Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[146:32.27]What?
[146:32.79]Is that it?
[146:33.21]Oh god, one of these...
[147:01.54]We were walking in together and I noticed him out the corner of the eye and I turned and said, oh, cool.
[147:06.90]It's great to meet you.
[147:08.06]I love your streams.
[147:09.83]Sorry, I won't interrupt you anymore.
[147:11.57]I just wanted to say I appreciate you.
[147:13.75]He turns around to me, frown on his face, and he says, oh, you don't want to interrupt me like you're doing now?
[147:19.52]Oh, my fucking God, this is copypasta in real life.
[147:24.20]Huh?
[147:24.74]Huh?
[147:25.06]He says before sneering at me.
[147:29.51]His hand was opening and shutting in my face.
[147:31.19]It was kind of scary.
[147:35.19]I turn around to finish my shopping.
[147:37.15]I don't want to interrupt him anymore.
[147:38.59]He's clearly angry.
[147:40.47]I hear him laughing behind me.
[147:42.56]It's really just the nail in the coffin for me.
[147:45.99]So I finished my shopping, and I didn't expect to see him again, but there he is.
[147:50.57]He's walked past the registers, and he's just attempting to leave with all his items in his hands.
[147:57.94]He hadn't paid for any of them.
[148:00.06]The lady at the register said, sir, you need to pay for those.
[148:03.94]That's 40 Dr. Peppers.
[148:05.32]You're gonna have to pay for that.
[148:07.78]He tried to ignore her.
[148:08.90]He tried to act like she wasn't there, but he clearly heard her, and eventually he came back to the register.
[148:15.86]She started scanning it.
[148:16.98]She decided to pick one up and scan it just over and over instead of taking them all out of his arms.
[148:22.30]He said, no, wait, wait.
[148:24.88]I'm going to need to make you scan each one individually to negate the electrical interference.
[148:32.26]These were his words exactly.
[148:33.46]I didn't know what he meant.
[148:35.24]He turned to look at me.
[148:36.25]I can't fucking believe that somebody made this.
[148:40.37]What's electrical interference and what's it have to do with Dr. Pepper?
[148:43.57]That's just what I got to know.
[148:45.89]Anyways, he got it all scanned up and loaded it into one bag.
[148:49.35]I don't know how he fit it all, but I expected him to take off in a car.
[148:54.31]He didn't.
[148:54.87]He rode away on a Razor scooter.
[148:57.12]Guest times aren't so good for him.
[149:00.68]Did fellow mafia watch TV last night?
[149:03.14]Confusing science owls say small people can jump double in air.
[149:06.62]This is from A Hat in Time.
[149:11.74]I saw.
[149:12.58]This makes Mafia uncomfortable with body.
[149:15.16]Must go work out.
[149:16.14]I thought that was the end of the video.
[149:19.21]I was like, what the fuck?
[149:21.29]I haven't even played this game.
[149:37.80]Oh, here it comes.

[157:21.51]So this is a German 19... German 980.
[157:23.11]9... 1980.
[157:23.45]Or 980s.
[157:23.93]German, I gotta go to work in five hours.
[157:44.91]There's only like 10 more, and by 10 more I mean like 25.
[157:48.25]And by 25 I mean like 21.
[157:48.99]It's almost 1 a.m.
[158:01.43]Eastern.
[158:04.69]They're too fun, I have to keep playing them!
[158:13.16]This one's pretty good too.
[158:20.15]What is this intro from?
[158:59.21]What a great time to be alive.
[159:00.57]Hotline Miami.
[159:03.20]And there's the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Snap dance thing.
[159:17.81]GTA V.
[159:19.44]Clip it.
[159:19.72]I don't suppose they told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
[159:24.84]I heard a man named Charles Grady is the winter caretaker.
[159:29.28]From what I've been told, I mean, he seemed like a completely normal individual.
[159:33.77]Fucking Jesus.
[159:34.47]But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.
[159:40.89]He ran amok and killed his family.
[159:47.06]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[159:52.35]Proof presents.
[159:53.09]Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
[159:56.35]Sure I do.
[159:57.61]It'll be lots of fun.
[159:58.85]The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is a tremendous sense of isolation.
[160:04.68]Is there something bad here?
[160:08.42]I fear you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way.
[160:14.16]Calm down.
[160:14.94]You don't have to worry about it.
[160:17.30]I'm going to kill you.
[160:22.69]I mean, I don't know.
[160:25.35]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[160:26.59]You know, who knows?
[160:33.28]What was that?
[160:38.56]Clip it.
[160:46.32]Oh, my fucking Jesus.
[160:48.21]Hello.
[160:50.93]We are so glad you're here.
[160:52.43]Blue and I were just about to... Hello.

[161:02.67]Why am I fighting Blue and Steve?
[161:04.19]I don't want to fight you, man.
[161:09.05]Why would I do it?
[161:11.21]Why would you make me punch the dog?

[162:57.12]Only like 10 to 20 more minutes.
[162:59.28]Whoa, whoa.
[163:08.45]Hey, kids, you want to sing a car song?
[163:10.79]This one has been used so often.
[163:14.09]Hey.
[163:14.27]Hey, kids, want to sing a car song?
[163:15.71]Hey, welcome to Lyft.
[163:30.30]No, I've been driving for probably a couple of years now.
[163:37.07]I've been driving for Lyft.
[163:38.67]This is the Lyft thing.
[163:45.21]Yeah.
[163:45.43]Yeah, well, I moved here when I was probably 19 or something.

[164:19.50]Oh, baby.
[164:20.60]Who wants some of this?
[164:25.40]I love the fighting game ones.
[164:30.14]You don't understand the amount of effort it takes to do this.
[164:35.73]It takes so much time to put this together.
[164:38.39]It really does.
[164:39.03]Did I kill him?
[164:41.81]I think I just killed this guy.
[164:45.85]Bang.
[164:46.39]Nice.
[164:50.49]Taunt cancelled.
[164:55.09]What's next?
[165:00.01]Oh, that's fucking loud!
[165:10.51]Oh, God.
[165:11.33]You figured somebody was gonna do this one.
[165:56.86]Here's germa bullet hell
[166:18.99]This is another mod, this is actually a real game.
[166:37.14]This shit is actually downloadable and actually playable.
[166:47.71]Three different characters.
[166:50.67]Do you want to know how I know that?
[166:51.95]Would you like to know how I know that?
[166:54.07]Well, that's because I have the game right here.
[167:09.79]Here's the bullet hell.
[167:11.62]I couldn't fucking believe this was real.
[167:16.45]So we're gonna be... Let's just do regular Jerma.
[167:19.71]Let's play a couple of rounds here.
[167:24.35]This is gonna fucking hurt.
[167:31.88]So it's a bullet hell dodge game I'm actually playing right now.
[167:39.92]Absolutely terrible.
[167:41.50]I lost.
[167:42.10]Seven seconds.
[167:42.98]Nothing about this is good.
[167:48.87]This shit is real.
[167:49.81]Somebody made this game.
[167:51.43]Somebody put the time into making this.
[168:05.12]Oh, more than 10 seconds.
[168:06.40]Come on, come on, come on.
[168:06.94]More than 5 seconds.
[168:08.48]25 seconds.
[168:08.92]Come on.
[168:11.27]Made it.
[168:12.27]Watch out.
[168:13.33]Okay, I'm fine.
[168:13.69]I'm good.
[168:13.93]I'm good.
[168:14.23]I'm good.
[168:15.89]20 seconds.
[168:16.19]That's pretty good.
[168:20.09]I did it.
[168:24.50]Trip of fleas finish.
[168:25.48]I have an exam.
[168:27.12]I had to play this for at least fucking 30 seconds.
[168:32.26]I want to get a link to that because that's the mod as well.
[168:37.46]That's fucking insane that somebody did that.
[168:40.16]I need to link to this.
[168:46.80]Here's the game.
[168:49.49]Oh, that's not the game, hold on.
[168:52.75]Copy, uh, I need to copy this.
[168:59.28]Like, this shit is fucking ridiculous.
[169:02.74]Seriously, well done.
[169:07.86]Well fucking done.
[169:11.15]I have to play this for an hour?
[169:12.41]No, no, we got, we got, like, how many more videos we got?
[169:17.00]Ooh, let's see.
[169:18.14]We are down to the last 60.
[169:19.92]I'm just kidding.
[169:23.47]Let's go.
[169:34.69]Turbo Fortress.
[169:36.45]Morbid!
[169:47.26]That's it for this one.
[169:49.70]This is called Mugen, another... Harry, and listen, listen.
[169:52.26]There's another mod.
[169:56.06]Somebody put me into Mugen, apparently.
[169:58.56]Look at this shit.
[169:59.30]I can't even comprehend how much work you guys put into some of these.
[170:03.07]Seriously.
[170:21.40]You're gonna be insulting, Beck.
[170:29.52]I don't even know how... Yeah, there's a Ninja Turtle in there too.
[170:45.39]This is so good, and I got a fireman special move, you kidding me?
[170:55.77]I wonder where I'll be in the meta.
[171:02.14]So fucking awesome.
[171:06.60]P tier, what is P tier?
[171:15.55]What does P-tier mean?
[171:20.81]Almost all of his crouch moves.
[171:22.05]Really, the entire fighter is... Is it a joke character?
[171:27.03]No, I'm gonna be at least, like, in the top 100.
[171:37.49]So, shout out to that dude that said, put Fireman as a projectile.
[171:42.83]That's all I got.
[171:43.53]Well, that was fucking awesome.
[171:44.49]He's broken as fuck and I'm terrible at fighting games, but I intend to work more on it.
[171:47.66]Well... That's fucking amazing.
[171:49.98]Good, thank you.
[171:50.30]Teleportation technique unleashed.
[171:54.32]Uh, German's a Hudson.
[171:55.82]No.
[171:58.00]Tim Davidson.
[172:00.13]What?
[172:00.61]Hey, man.
[172:02.01]Great honor to meet you, sir.
[172:03.71]I hear you by the scientist.
[172:06.29]Oh, I'm something of a scientist person.
[172:08.78]I read all your research on nanotechnology.
[172:10.96]Really brilliant.
[172:13.04]Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
[172:15.46]Holy shit.
[172:38.07]That ain't a fuckin' petri dish, motherfucker!
[172:41.27]Uh, yeah.
[172:43.52]What just broke?
[172:45.62]It doesn't seem so bad.
[172:48.84]Another Jedi.
[172:49.84]I'm a Jedi!
[172:55.69]Woo!
[173:00.55]He's fuckin' serious.
[173:11.92]This is brainwashing is what somebody said.
[173:21.15]This is brainwashing.
[173:59.04]Why is that a gun?
[174:13.69]Oh my god.
[174:21.93]That was awesome.
[174:30.45]Oh, no.
[174:35.54]What?
[174:36.20]Uh...

[175:08.46]Shit, I just did a, I just did a Fortnite dance!
[175:29.82]This streamer sucks.
[175:36.33]Oh my god.
[175:37.15]The streamer's freaking out!
[175:48.05]These are all chatters, apparently.
[175:57.72]I really am that good, aren't I?
[176:11.63]Oh, my life!
[176:13.09]Oh, this is actually me doing this.
[176:16.25]First try, by the way.
[176:18.15]Did a first try.
[176:20.09]No!
[176:28.23]Beat him.
[176:28.63]You can't take that from me.
[176:29.45]This is a germiciding.
[177:01.13]Don't get it.
[177:10.27]What is- why is this?
[177:11.87]Infinity War.
[177:12.71]Oh my fucking god.
[177:18.02]I can't handle it anymore.
[177:20.76]Let's go.
[177:27.18]Another incredibly well-made presentation.
[177:35.29]Is this another real game?
[177:51.56]The pretend civilian, I love it.
[178:12.40]Watch out!
[178:16.12]Purple Germa!
[178:17.94]Is it purple?
[178:35.29]You weren't shooting the barrels.
[178:36.31]You gotta shoot the barrels, man.
[178:38.72]You should have gone for the head.
[178:40.70]Oh, God.
[178:48.72]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of GermaCraft, the series where I play- Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of GermaCraft.
[179:05.67]Didn't we just see this?
[179:08.81]I thought we just watched this one.
[179:11.69]Please.
[179:12.25]We saw this one.
[179:14.01]Oh my god.
[179:18.99]What a crossover.
[179:21.17]This is called Kung Fu Chroma Key.
[179:24.95]T posing in the background.
[179:50.89]Well made, well made.
[180:12.40]There's not very many more left.
[180:15.70]Fireman versus Jerma.
[180:21.37]This is really well made.
[180:47.99]Is this- is this Jo- is this another JoJo?
[180:49.93]JoJo?
[180:51.29]No, it's not another JoJo thing, right?
[180:53.85]Well, it's really good.
[181:03.74]Jerma meets and kills Mega Leg.
[181:11.92]Heh!
[181:23.27]Alright, hold on.
[181:24.97]Oh, I need to see.
[181:26.21]I need to see.
[181:28.83]Oh, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, we are down to the final 11.
[181:35.96]There's only, I think, 11 or 12 left.
[181:37.68]We're almost done completely.
[181:40.08]We've watched almost 400 fucking videos.
[181:49.18]There's still a few more.
[181:50.14]Let's drop in.
[181:58.96]Another Germa Raptor.
[182:19.65]Germa fights his clone.
[182:23.25]Jeremy Elbertson was just your normal everyday scientist.
[182:28.76]Until he used his 200 IQ genius brain and created a perfect clone.
[182:36.60]And they were the best of friends.
[182:43.00]Nothing lasts forever, his clone became corrupted.
[182:49.75]What the fuck is that?
[182:59.66]If I don't move, it won't save me.
[183:13.99]To defeat this clone, he'll have to train and become Jexed.
[183:23.40]Stupid fucking nunchuck.
[183:42.55]Yeet.
[183:44.17]I've never said yeet before in my whole life.
[183:46.81]Jerma fights his clone or some shit in the movie.
[183:49.67]That's it?
[183:51.73]It's canceled.
[183:52.83]The show is canceled.
[183:54.81]Super Jerma Odyssey.
[183:55.87]It's a me, Mario.
[183:57.27]Megan, get your hand down here.
[184:00.12]That's like a 400-foot jump.
[184:00.90]Come on.
[184:01.54]I guess I'll give it a try.
[184:03.80]No, no, don't worry about me.
[184:06.90]Two, three.
[184:12.74]You got something to say?
[184:15.78]I'm ready!
[184:16.70]I'm ready!
[184:17.66]I'm ready!
[184:20.90]I'm ready!
[184:24.94]Who is this?
[184:26.10]I'm sorry!
[184:43.42]Big, Germa visits Zoltar.
[184:44.98]From the movie Big with Tom Hanks.
[185:02.52]That's terrifying.
[185:03.42]It's an old movie.
[185:04.28]I don't know what to say.
[185:14.90]Zoltar says, make your wish.
[185:16.11]I want a big... What a gamer.
[185:32.04]What a god of a gamer, seriously.
[185:37.94]Your wish is granted.
[185:40.40]Alright, so now I have a little bit longer legs.
[185:43.82]Just a little bit, though.
[185:45.83]Turn it off.
[185:48.87]Are you in charge of this?
[185:52.11]Turn it off.
[185:53.97]Get the shutters off.
[185:54.71]Shut them all off.
[185:56.03]Turn your lights in your house off, too.
[186:02.38]The plug.
[186:04.64]Here comes the Muffet Show featuring very special guest, me.
