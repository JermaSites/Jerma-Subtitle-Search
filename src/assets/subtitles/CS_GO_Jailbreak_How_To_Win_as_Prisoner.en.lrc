[00:06.28]Wait, am I the only one with a mic?
[00:08.10]Hey, Spruce!
[00:09.12]What are we gonna do?
[00:09.90]Are we gonna hide?
[00:10.50]Are we gonna hide back here when terrorists come to get us?
[00:12.58]We're both gonna attack them.
[00:13.76]Hey, I got a pistol.
[00:15.28]Okay.
[00:16.20]You wanna hide?
[00:16.76]Give me the pistol.
[00:19.47]Everyone crouch, walk through the gray line.
[00:22.21]We can both just sit back and hide.
[00:24.53]Why can I not pick up the pistol?
[00:26.53]If we hear somebody coming, we both have to go in and attack them.
[00:30.59]Wait, I can't pick up this pistol!
[00:32.37]If you are caught with a grenade, you will be shot.
[00:34.99]No, you're not an enemy shot.
[00:36.51]I'm probably going to come over here and check.
[00:40.72]I know.
[00:41.50]Just stay quiet.
[00:42.70]I just threw a nade.
[00:44.60]That was bad.
[00:46.26]Stay quiet.
[00:47.28]We got the stealth.
[00:52.44]We're going to play first reaction, last reaction.
[00:55.74]Hopefully they don't get a head down.
[01:00.59]Hopefully they'll walk us out.
[01:01.63]What is going on?
[01:03.07]Anyone else would like to rebel?
[01:05.35]I'm still in my cell right now.
[01:06.71]Me too.
[01:07.13]I'm going to try and come in your cell.
[01:12.75]Everyone get in the same cell.
[01:14.95]Get in the same cell.
[01:16.11]Hey, there's a pistol in my toilet, but I can't pick it up.
[01:37.17]Hopefully they don't count.
[01:37.99]There's only two of them left, but there's five people alive.
[01:41.31]They should notice.

[03:50.17]He's coming up the ladder.
[03:51.69]No, he's not.

[04:41.96]This is bad.
[04:43.03]Don't peek out.
[04:44.95]He's on the balcony across the way.
[04:48.21]I have 15 health.

[05:05.92]How much health do you have, Jerma?
[05:09.18]4 health.
[05:10.43]Alright, Delph, you need to do this from the corner and you gotta shoot.
[05:12.91]We all gotta go.
[05:13.44]We gotta pop out at the same time.

[05:42.40]The others are attacking him.
[05:43.44]Go, go, go.
[05:44.58]They're both dead.
[05:45.72]He's behind the cage.
[05:47.42]He's behind all those boxes right in front of you.
[05:51.24]Nice.
[05:53.51]Oh yeah.
[05:54.88]Such BS with such assholes.
