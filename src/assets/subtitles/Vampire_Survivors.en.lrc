[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.74]Okay, I'm back.
[00:08.23]So, Vampire Survivors.
[00:10.39]This is not the first time I've played this game.
[00:15.73]Holly and I used to, when it first came out, really just grind this.
[00:22.11]I've played a lot of this so far.
[00:24.59]But it was really when it first came out.
[00:27.55]So I have not played it in like six or seven updates.
[00:38.97]I did play a lot of it though, so I'm very seasoned.
[00:48.51]If you don't know what this game is, then you're in for a treat because the game is actually incredible.
[00:55.62]Okay, let's get it open.
[01:04.74]I might be a little rusty.
[01:05.62]It has been a while.
[01:07.84]We'll find out.
[01:14.70]No wobble dogs?
[01:16.56]No, I want to play this.
[01:22.92]So I don't know how to get like the new... There's a bunch of new characters, I think.
[01:28.61]I do need to turn it up, though.
[01:31.33]That is far too low.
[01:34.63]How's that?
[01:34.99]Better?
[01:40.24]Okay.
[01:41.28]Can you see?
[01:41.80]I don't think you can see yet.
[01:42.82]Hold on.
[01:43.02]You can't even see me.
[01:48.89]No.
[01:51.41]This is fucking creepy.
[01:53.97]Okay.
[01:55.49]Let's get it up here.
[02:02.33]Fucking Glover.
[02:18.17]Can you see it?
[02:21.19]No?
[02:23.93]No?
[02:28.65]I've never captured this game before.
[02:29.84]Do I have to capture the... I probably have to capture the window.
[02:33.52]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[02:40.22]Oh, let me get it.
[02:40.82]Hold on.
[02:41.16]Okay...
[02:49.56]There it is.
[02:52.38]Should be able to see it now.
[02:53.26]Okay, that's not correct.
[02:59.16]That is also not correct.
[03:02.16]That is not correct either.
[03:05.81]Hey, look at that.
[03:08.27]Okay, I got a lot of money, as you see.
[03:10.43]I got a lot of cash.
[03:11.85]I play with a controller.
[03:12.65]Does that make me a shitty person?
[03:15.41]Does that make me bad?
[03:21.33]How come it's not... There we go, okay.
[03:25.43]Yeah, does it make me bad at the game?
[03:26.90]I don't know, you just move around.
[03:30.08]You literally just walk around.
[03:31.06]Alright, so let's get started.
[03:31.80]So, start.
[03:32.22]If you want to see what I've done... I've gotten to level 20 in the forest.
[03:37.76]This, all this shit, yeah, I don't even know what this is.
[03:42.51]A hundred?
[03:44.29]I've survived ten minutes.
[03:46.09]Alright, let's just go.
[03:49.45]Want to see my collection?
[03:51.45]So they added a lot of stuff, huh?
[03:53.47]There's like a whole row of new items.
[03:55.86]I'm interested.
[04:00.48]So who should I play with?
[04:01.90]I like this guy with the bones.
[04:03.82]You get more?
[04:04.26]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[04:04.76]I need to do my unlocks.
[04:06.93]Oh, power-ups, yeah.
[04:09.51]So did they add any new power-ups?
[04:14.47]Revive once with 50% health.
[04:16.39]That seems kind of insane.
[04:20.10]Curse.
[04:20.44]Increases enemy speed, health, quantity, and frequency by 10% per rank.
[04:26.23]Why would you want to do this?
[04:31.83]That feels kind of like... Just make the game harder?
[04:36.36]It's a challenge run.
[04:37.60]Oh, okay.
[04:38.76]I'm going to try this.
[04:39.26]I'll take this one.
[04:41.48]And then I usually take the damage one.
[04:43.20]I love the damage one.
[04:44.26]And by the way, the money I got because as you play the game, you just get money.
[04:49.17]And you can spend it however you want.
[04:51.55]You can refund it whenever you want as well.
[04:53.57]I know I'm making a lot of motions and gestures towards you.
[04:57.13]You can refund it whenever you want.
[05:00.52]Alright, so this is damage.
[05:03.00]5% damage per rank.
[05:03.94]I'm just going to do this max.
[05:08.12]What else did I used to do?
[05:09.32]Pull down...
[05:13.94]Oh, more projectiles?
[05:14.80]Hell yeah.
[05:16.38]Move speed?
[05:16.88]Hell yeah.
[05:18.75]Luck?
[05:19.01]Hell yeah.
[05:23.57]More coins?
[05:24.25]Yeah.
[05:27.81]What else is good?
[05:28.45]I forget.
[05:28.81]I haven't played in like three or four months.
[05:32.37]Probably area, right?
[05:33.63]Attack speed?
[05:34.41]Oh, that's right.
[05:34.93]I don't really care about the magnet thing, although it's very helpful.
[05:42.57]Greed?
[05:46.68]Max health?
[05:50.10]Duration?
[05:53.06]Yeah, whatever.
[05:53.46]I mean, it's been a while.
[05:54.16]I'm just going to fucking put points where it doesn't matter.
[05:56.62]Alright, let's go.
[05:58.20]I'm going to play with the bone guy.
[05:59.94]So I get extra projectiles.
[06:03.44]Where do I want to play, though?
[06:08.09]Not yet discovered.
[06:11.24]stage two oh the library wait so hold on what should I do this one can I do this I can't do this one yet should I do this one do the library alright let's go see if I remember how to play this game
[06:31.97]So all you do, for those who have no idea, for those who have never played, you literally walk around and the game auto attacks enemies around you.
[06:39.56]And the game's harder and harder and harder.
[06:40.92]You get more and more and more powerful and there's more and more and more enemies.
[06:44.12]It's so good.
[06:45.50]It's like one of the best games ever made.
[06:47.72]Okay.
[06:48.98]So what do I want to do here?
[06:49.66]I probably, I like lightning.
[06:51.22]Strikes at random enemies.
[06:52.66]You level up every so often.
[06:53.78]Check this out.
[06:54.76]Boom.
[06:59.36]See that?
[07:00.30]That's lightning level one.
[07:01.43]There's like eight ranks, I think, of ten ranks of every weapon.
[07:05.89]The little gems I'm picking up on the ground, that is experience points.
[07:09.57]When it fills up at the top, you probably can guess what happens.
[07:12.13]There we go.
[07:15.92]Alright, what do I want?
[07:18.60]You guys gotta help me out here, because once you get two weapons to maximum...
[07:24.22]Once you level up and you get two weapons that can combine into a super weapon.
[07:30.04]I kind of don't fucking remember.
[07:31.76]I know Lightning didn't have one.
[07:33.24]Does Lightning have an upgrade now?
[07:37.65]Does Lightning have an upgrade?
[07:40.51]It does.
[07:40.95]Alright.
[07:42.25]How do I do it?
[07:45.61]It tells you what you need to evolve now, really.
[07:49.31]It's wings.
[07:51.15]The duplicator, okay.
[07:53.05]So I'll go whip.
[07:53.83]I like whip.
[08:03.24]Duplicator involves lightning?
[08:04.48]Hell yeah.
[08:05.12]Lightning's my favorite move.
[08:11.82]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[08:12.81]It's just doing it automatically.
[08:13.77]By the way, this game is like fucking $3.
[08:15.15]It's $3. $3.
[08:26.55]This is an ad.
[08:27.95]I mean, honestly, this game is amazing.
[08:31.82]It's $3.
[08:32.12]What do you want me to say?
[08:35.56]8% more experience.
[08:36.06]I like that.
[08:39.49]Yeah, I want more EXP.
[08:42.51]This is making me want to play it.
[08:45.05]I am excited.
[08:45.43]You know what I did?
[08:45.91]The thing about early access.
[08:48.17]This game is in early access.
[08:49.75]I was sitting here going, oh, wow, this game is so good.
[08:52.19]But it was so early.
[08:54.34]And I did the thing where I said, you know what?
[08:56.24]I want to play it so bad.
[08:58.38]This is like the last three or four months.
[09:01.04]But I just did not because I knew eventually, like right now, I was going to get to a point where like there's enough added.
[09:08.25]Where there's way more for me to see.
[09:09.47]Alright, so I already got bone.
[09:13.17]I'm going to do bone level 2.
[09:15.01]Last 0.2 seconds longer.
[09:16.21]Base area by... Yeah, let's go.
[09:18.07]Bone level 2.
[09:24.11]Santa water is OP.
[09:25.57]It is, but I... What was that?
[09:28.77]Oh, shit.
[09:29.13]Uh-oh.
[09:29.47]Okay, don't be an idiot.
[09:34.18]You do not die in one hit.
[09:35.38]You have health, but it's bad to get hit.
[09:39.58]Santa Water has upgraded now.
[09:40.78]I feel like I... Did I play the one update that had the upgrade?
[09:45.76]I don't know.
[09:52.12]The library is hard because there's not a whole lot of room to move around.
[09:54.58]There's a new enemy.
[09:57.20]Do water and ore.
[10:04.45]Level two.
[10:04.81]Yeah.
[10:05.29]Yeah, I want more whip.
[10:06.33]Let's go.
[10:08.10]Whip is what?
[10:08.94]Whip is to get the super whip.
[10:18.56]Whip and heart?
[10:19.06]Yeah.
[10:19.56]Okay.
[10:20.32]Hollow heart.
[10:20.72]Okay, lightning again.
[10:24.26]Did you say wings do anything?
[10:32.94]XP is early is good too.
[10:34.62]Yeah, but I want lightning.
[10:35.72]Let's go.
[10:38.81]No, XP.
[10:39.29]Let's do it.
[10:49.59]So as time goes on, the game just gets harder.
[10:52.69]So you can really kind of blow up a whole run.
[10:55.18]If you build without like enough damage or without enough health or speed.
[10:59.62]You can blow up an entire run.
[11:07.78]Alright.
[11:09.60]Uh... Does Bone have an upgrade?
[11:18.37]I don't think... Does Bone... Bone doesn't have an upgrade, does it?
[11:22.41]No.
[11:22.95]It didn't happen before either.
[11:23.85]I want like... Oh, shit.
[11:27.34]What is that?
[11:29.56]Oh, one of the mods just linked an evolution chart.
[11:31.18]You're the best.
[11:36.79]Bone is bad, is it?
[11:38.33]I like this guy.
[11:39.69]Is this guy bottom tier?
[11:40.61]I thought this guy was good.
[11:47.01]Oh, chat gave it to me?
[11:47.99]Oh, chat is an absolute pog.
[11:52.17]Yeah, bone bounces.
[11:53.03]I like that it can bounce off of people.
[11:58.65]Can we go bone level 3 or do I get some spinach or anything?
[12:08.95]I would say just damage up and one more bone.
[12:11.72]Yeah, let's do that.
[12:12.50]That sounds fucking pretty sick.
[12:14.52]Get the mouse off the screen, by the way.
[12:31.35]Mortachio used to be the best character in the game.
[12:33.55]Did they nerf this character?
[12:34.27]That one again.
[12:36.47]This thing's awesome.
[12:37.27]Did they give an upgrade to this?
[12:38.63]Because this thing's incredible.
[12:41.59]This is the thing that bounces around and goes through people.
[12:44.15]This thing's incredible, right?
[12:46.15]They did.
[12:46.69]Alright, I want it.
[12:47.31]How do I do it?
[12:49.29]I don't even know what this thing... How do I do it?
[12:53.15]Armor?
[12:53.33]Armor?
[12:55.65]I don't want to get screwed up here, though, because the thing is, these are permanent.
[12:59.71]You can't take these off.
[13:02.05]And you can have six of each thing.
[13:04.31]There's six... See the top and the top left?
[13:07.78]The top is the weapon slots, and the bottom is the item slots.
[13:10.98]So you gotta be careful you don't screw it all up.
[13:15.16]Because I can't pick anything else up.
[13:19.28]I'll do Rune Tracer, yeah.
[13:21.32]Because I want to see the shit that I haven't seen.
[13:25.51]If I see armor, I'm getting it.
[13:30.77]God damn it.
[13:31.51]Am I actually going to stream like all fucking night?
[13:34.83]Yeah, probably.
[13:36.07]Yeah, let's go.
[13:36.51]I'm going to have to take a break to eat something, though.
[13:45.36]Yeah, I would tell you right now, the stream is good.
[13:47.14]We're going to we're going to just kind of chill and play this the fuck out of this for like the next at least three or four hours.
[13:53.50]So, we're gonna chill, just play, right?
[13:56.00]It's gonna be fun.
[14:00.80]I love this item.
[14:06.80]I just completed all my exams?
[14:08.56]Hell yeah.
[14:09.12]Hope you did good.
[14:11.28]This, you need this.
[14:12.50]I need this because I'm terrible.
[14:15.28]Laurel sucks.
[14:17.20]I'm awful at this game, so I need it.
[14:21.04]Let's talk about what a chest does, okay?
[14:23.64]So when you open a chest, it randomly, depending on if you can get an epic, a legendary, I don't know what it is yet.
[14:29.47]It randomly upgrades one or two or three items that you have.
[14:32.79]Alright, cool.
[14:40.54]Yeah, that's good.
[14:41.96]I'll take it.
[14:44.42]That's good for me.
[14:50.40]You can get a legendary chest that's five random upgrades.
[14:53.68]And oh my god, does it feel good.
[14:59.56]Whip.
[15:04.07]I'm telling you right now.
[15:07.35]I... Me and Holly would just sit on the couch.
[15:13.38]And I would just be high with my mouth open.
[15:17.15]Just like watching her play.
[15:19.93]I would literally be sitting there like this.
[15:26.31]For like two straight hours.
[15:31.16]I'm doing whip again.
[15:31.84]I should be like, hey, do you want to play?
[15:36.38]No.
[15:40.12]I just want to watch you.
[15:47.00]Ooh, dinner!
[15:47.54]Does that mean health?
[15:57.96]Alright, I got it.
[15:59.12]So now here's what happens.
[16:01.44]So this is random, right?
[16:03.54]So if I max out the armor and I max out the rune tracer, I can combine them.
[16:10.85]This is gonna be awesome.
[16:12.57]I can't wait.
[16:13.31]Don't tell me what it does, because I don't want to know.
[16:16.83]Alright, now this is a run, so I can't fuck it up.
[16:18.47]Don't be an idiot.
[16:25.58]Once you confirm that you have the two items that you need to at least do one or two major upgrades, don't fuck it up.
[16:38.61]This is an auto battler, ResidentSleeper.
[16:40.35]No, you don't ResidentSleeper vampire spirers.
[16:42.23]I'm sorry.
[16:42.63]You just don't.
[16:43.75]You can't.
[16:44.23]You can't do that.
[16:44.99]This is like actually like I think illegal.
[16:48.32]Nice.
[16:48.94]Whip upgrade.
[16:57.05]Okay.
[16:59.59]Do I just rush this?
[17:01.39]Or do I just let it go?
[17:03.67]I'm at 10 minutes is where it gets crazy.
[17:10.53]Go with Santa Water.
[17:13.57]If I get Santa Water, that's it.
[17:15.29]I don't have any other room for upgrades.
[17:17.59]For weapons.
[17:19.81]So I need... If I do Santa Water... So I have the Rune Tracer.
[17:24.81]I need the heart container for the whip.
[17:28.09]So that's two.
[17:31.84]Okay, I'll have enough room, right?
[17:35.28]Will I have enough?
[17:36.14]I can't make the decision yet.
[17:36.94]I don't know.
[17:41.64]Only the weapon needs to be maxed?
[17:42.84]Really?
[17:45.66]I thought it was both.
[17:48.88]Really?
[17:51.16]Fire wand.
[17:53.40]This is it.
[17:53.84]Alright.
[17:54.48]We got the hollow heart.
[17:56.54]So now I'll be able to get the max whip soon.
[18:00.37]Which is huge.
[18:01.13]The max whip has lifesteal too, which is crazy.
[18:14.86]okay so we're gonna do lightning orb rune tracer and whip mega upgrades and okay yeah let's do it because that if this is Santa orb right Santa um let me see let me make sure yeah it is alright let's do it
[18:43.65]Around the 10 minute mark is where this gets wild.
[18:50.63]What's the lore for the game?
[18:51.95]I actually don't know.
[18:52.67]We're gonna do bone.
[19:02.58]It's like Castlevania.
[19:04.56]Kind of reminds me of Castlevania.
[19:07.64]Bone again.
[19:09.34]Another projectile for bone.
[19:15.89]So am I on level two for the library?
[19:23.26]Oh, it's getting wild.
[19:25.22]ResidentSleeper.
[19:26.14]Now, we're just chilling out now, right?
[19:29.21]Like, okay, if I'm gonna...
[19:40.20]That's like the, I need to pretend like this is crazy so you don't leave.
[19:44.36]Right?
[19:45.34]Like, oh, it's getting wild.
[19:47.22]It's getting crazy, guys.
[19:48.33]Oh, whoa, it's getting wild out here.
[19:50.85]So, you know, like, we're going to click the X. Oh, you don't want to miss this.
[20:02.04]No, I don't.
[20:02.64]It's fine.
[20:03.96]That thing explodes and I might get hit.
[20:13.83]I need to... I haven't seen Rune Tracer at all.
[20:18.09]Oh, dude.
[20:18.41]It's getting wild.
[20:24.02]Those things explode and they can kill you in like one hit.
[20:25.98]They really can.
[20:26.54]It's awful.
[20:28.12]It's truly terrible.
[20:31.66]Oh, this is going to be awesome.
[20:32.96]Oh, it's getting fucking wild.
[20:35.75]You see that?
[20:38.16]Okay, yep, I want the Santa Water.
[20:39.76]Santa Water drops little splashes.
[20:43.06]There we go, finally.
[20:46.36]What's the lightning upgrade?
[20:55.03]A ring?
[20:55.37]A duplicator.
[20:56.61]Okay, so I don't want to take... I'll take the ring.
[21:04.82]You're kind of like the friend that's really interested in the niche game.
[21:14.29]Would you call this game niche right now?
[21:16.61]I feel like this is one of the most popular games on Steam.
[21:18.37]I feel like this game is wildly, wildly popular.
[21:30.55]So in that first screen, I know like most of you guys have already played this or seen this a million times, but in that first screen where you can do the power-ups, see the little blue area of effect that's kind of like twinkling, that's kind of on the ground, that does damage when people walk on it?
[21:45.07]When you first do the power-up screen, you do area of effect, you do cooldown reduction, right?
[21:52.72]You kind of build the character the way- I'm sorry, I bumped you.
[21:58.99]What do I want to do first?
[22:00.27]Probably this one.
[22:03.87]From what I remember, the stance of water at high levels is fucking crazy.
[22:06.55]And I'm not going to swear anymore, because what was the point of saying the F word?
[22:16.26]Good.
[22:17.38]I'll take it.
[22:26.14]The F word.
[22:30.90]This is a pro tip for you.
[22:32.18]If you see health on the ground, and you have full health, don't touch it.
[22:35.94]You might need it later.
[22:36.66]And things do not despawn.
[22:40.61]That's a little pro tip for you.
[22:52.27]we're almost at 10 minutes is where it gets hard uh this is where it determines if you have the right build to continue going and oh my god it's about to get really wild here I actually stopped around because I don't want to lose at 10 minutes the game says okay you've been playing for a little while let's see if you can actually beat it let's see if you have like a build that's worth playing I'm gonna do whip because it's closest
[23:28.19]Okay, this is gonna be huge.
[23:29.15]Should I just do Spellbinder for the Santa Water?
[23:38.92]So wild, crazy, hyper, insane-o.
[23:46.29]I think I'm just doing Santa Water.
[23:49.95]Spellbinder also helps the bone.
[23:54.87]Yeah...
[24:01.54]I'm doing it.
[24:06.00]Spellbinder again.
[24:09.44]You love to see that.
[24:10.40]That's awesome.
[24:11.08]You love to see that happen.
[24:14.35]Okay, I'm going to do Bone again.
[24:15.37]Base damage almost at max Bone.
[24:20.39]Whoa, XP batches.
[24:27.10]Alright.
[24:27.80]Bone is maximum.
[24:30.93]I cannot upgrade bone anymore that's good it's gonna be bouncing around and helping out okay imagine imagine imagine bat chesting Vampire Survivors imagine bat chesting Vampire Survivors who are you okay I want rune tracer fires another projectile
[25:06.38]I forget what this does.
[25:08.14]Kills everything on the screen.
[25:08.96]Hell yeah.
[25:14.19]Alright.
[25:15.95]Spellbinder.
[25:16.93]Yeah.
[25:27.52]The red ones are worth way more.
[25:28.92]Alright.
[25:33.20]Am I missing any secondary item that I need?
[25:36.86]Wings is... No, because I need the duplicator.
[25:46.23]So I can't do that.
[25:46.99]I can just do Santa Water again.
[25:54.70]Come on.
[25:55.20]I should smoke weed on stream.
[26:01.32]I'm not going to do that.
[26:05.34]Why?
[26:05.64]For what?
[26:08.23]chest actually I probably shouldn't touch that because when you get to a max you need to open it in a chest has that changed or is that the same it's the same okay alright so I don't want to touch that yet until I have something that's max so I can open the um yeah I'm not gonna touch it
[26:38.66]Look at that area.
[26:39.32]Look at that area.
[26:40.70]It's gotten so much bigger.
[26:55.27]Oh, wait.
[26:55.52]Are you guys bat testing?
[26:56.36]Because I'm saying like, oh, wow, this is so cool.
[26:58.70]Look at how cool this is.
[27:00.70]That's why you're doing that, right?
[27:14.00]You said chest.
[27:15.74]Oh, please.
[27:16.50]Alright.
[27:18.58]Attract orb again because I don't want to use the second.
[27:21.16]I only have one more slot, so I'm not using it.
[27:22.82]I need duplicator.
[27:45.72]I love this game.
[27:46.34]Yeah, I do too.
[27:47.04]This game's great.
[27:48.40]Don't listen to all the BatChest haters out there, okay?
[27:52.96]They're all just making it up.
[27:54.00]You can't not like this game.
[27:55.12]I don't think it's possible.
[28:00.36]Oop.
[28:01.18]Bat.
[28:01.52]Bat means chest usually.
[28:02.87]Fuck.
[28:04.45]BatChest.
[28:05.69]Bat means whatever.
[28:06.85]Fuck off.
[28:08.39]Fuck it.
[28:08.91]I don't...
[28:19.36]It actually does, though.
[28:21.88]If you kill one of those highlighted bats, there is a very high chance that it's going to drop a chest.
[28:31.07]What the fuck?
[28:37.47]It's been a while since I've seen a lightning.
[28:41.96]Stop!
[28:42.34]I know!
[28:42.64]Stop!
[28:42.90]You're making me swear!
[28:43.62]Alright, no more swearing.
[28:51.22]I can't, whatever.
[28:56.85]Dude, this isn't Paper Mario.
[28:58.45]Wait, are you defending the Batchesters or are you saying they shouldn't be doing it?
[29:04.52]Ooh!
[29:04.90]Alright, we're good.
[29:08.19]I got the duplicator.
[29:21.48]Whip is going to be first, I think.
[29:31.52]So how long do I have to survive in the library now?
[29:33.90]40 minutes at least?
[29:35.44]30 at least, okay.
[29:47.91]I think I've done that.
[29:49.55]Or have I?
[29:50.01]Maybe I did 20.
[29:56.15]Alright, there's two chests here.
[29:57.71]I think I'm just gonna get this one.
[30:00.92]No.
[30:02.20]Yeah.
[30:02.82]Okay, let's get it.
[30:06.71]Whatever.
[30:06.91]Alright, don't open the other one.
[30:22.32]I'm surprised that so many people don't know what this is.
[30:25.39]Well, hopefully some of you guys that didn't know what this was look at this and go, this is fucking fog champ.
[30:30.51]And I love it.
[30:31.77]There's a BatChest right there.
[30:36.73]They take a while to kill.
[30:44.64]See, I told you.
[30:52.32]Alright, there it is.
[30:52.84]I got Whip level 8.
[30:55.78]Check this out.
[31:02.54]Bloody Tear.
[31:04.62]Evolve Whip can deal critical damage and absorbs HP.
[31:07.01]Take a look at it now.
[31:09.25]Now this thing is insane.
[31:21.32]Play more of this?
[31:23.61]Yeah, I'm gonna play on this for the rest of the night.
[31:40.85]I mean, I will accept you... I will accept you bat-chesting Glover.
[31:46.01]But I am not gonna stand here and let you bat-chest Vampire Survivors.
[31:51.23]You have any... You don't even know what you're saying.
[31:53.71]It's like, it's crazy to me.
[31:56.63]Batchesting Glover.
[31:57.63]Okay.
[31:58.03]Oh, Glover N64.
[31:59.53]Whoa.
[32:01.18]Oh, excuse me.
[32:01.94]Alright.
[32:11.31]Lightning level six.
[32:19.71]Yep.
[32:20.83]I want to try to get the lightning one.
[32:21.89]I wonder what it does.
[32:22.45]Alright, lightning level 8.
[32:34.99]Here we go, let's do it.
[32:38.47]What does it do?
[32:45.22]Thunderloop, evolved lightning ring, projectile strike twice.
[32:48.56]Oh shit, that's probably crazy.
[32:54.26]Whoa, holy shit.
[32:57.08]Alright, that was actually insane.
[33:02.76]Alright.
[33:06.05]That's actually insane.
[33:26.53]Don't pass over the Duplicator.
[33:27.55]Um, I'm messing.
[33:38.92]This is a good run, actually.
[33:44.71]Alright, Duplicator.
[33:45.91]Again.
[33:47.07]Alright, what do we got here?
[33:48.27]Rune Tracer, level 6.
[33:50.15]Mm-hmm.
[33:58.97]a good chance of winning this yeah oh yeah absolutely sometimes you just get just dog shit and you just can't get something going and one more projectile base area by 20 yeah yeah I win this one this is gonna be a win here as long as I don't do anything like boneheaded what is that ah okay level seven Santa water
[34:30.54]Rune Tracer.
[34:31.22]Another projectile.
[34:36.28]This one.
[34:37.56]Jesus.
[34:38.30]Okay.
[34:38.66]Rune Tracer's level 8.
[34:39.59]I'm ready to upgrade it.
[34:40.41]Oh my god.
[34:43.93]They're all level 8.
[34:44.43]Where's the chest?
[35:04.33]What does this one do now?
[35:08.33]No future evolved Rune Tracer explodes when bouncing and in retaliation.
[35:15.51]Explodes?
[35:23.28]Oh my god.
[35:30.77]I think it's impossible to lose.
[35:35.65]I got another one, right?
[35:45.09]Hell yeah.
[35:46.79]Labora, evolve Santa water.
[35:48.27]Damaging zones follow you and grow when they move.
[35:53.54]Okay.
[35:55.92]Time for the bitrate to shit the bed.
[36:01.02]Don't I have a funny title?
[36:19.55]Don't go... Somebody said, don't commentate the game.
[36:23.54]I don't care.
[36:24.68]Okay, wait.
[36:27.58]What?
[36:28.26]What do you want?
[36:29.06]Do you want me to be quiet?
[36:38.34]Alright, the title of the stream is not Vampire Survivors, and then in brackets, Long Play No Commentary.
[36:44.54]Although maybe I should change it to that.
[36:45.88]Should I just change it to that?
[36:58.25]I have a joke.
[36:59.59]I'll do it.
[37:01.67]I'll do it for that person.
[37:29.98]Okay, here you go.
[37:30.85]Here's your joke.
[40:05.64]Fuck.
[40:09.47]Fuck.
[40:43.13]Fuck up.
[40:48.05]For one second.
[40:49.03]Fucking shut the fuck up.
[41:38.69]I just... Like people saying like, mute your mic.
[41:41.93]Mute mic, idiot.
[41:42.87]Like stop talking.
[41:45.59]Like I've built a reputation of being the guy that just doesn't talk on stream and everyone's like pissed when I do.
[42:04.50]And that would be a big controversy.
[42:08.31]That would be a huge controversy.
[42:10.95]If finally I just, I said something.
[42:13.31]And I'd be like, whatever.
[42:14.55]Like I sneezed once, like relax.
[42:17.57]And I lose like fucking a thousand, like a thousand viewers or something.
[42:21.33]Lose like 10,000 viewers.
[42:23.51]That's not what I'm here for.
[42:33.62]Voice reveal?
[42:47.98]Like, stop talking.
[42:48.78]Stop talking.
[42:49.14]Like, I did.
[42:49.58]I talked for not even a second, guys.
[42:51.25]Like, relax.
[42:55.81]This game is so loud.
[42:56.97]Hold on.
[42:57.29]Is it really?
[42:57.77]Hold on.
[42:58.01]Let me fix it.
[43:00.25]Is that better?
[43:02.63]I'm unstoppable right now.
[43:05.13]Your facecam quality is dog shit.
[43:09.33]What do you want me to do?
[43:10.07]I don't... It's so hot in this room.
[43:12.71]I don't...
[43:36.49]Always take the money.
[43:37.47]Always.
[43:37.69]This is amazing.
[43:55.13]I can't fall asleep to this.
[44:12.59]Here we go.
[44:14.43]More money.
[44:14.99]More.
[44:15.19]Give me more.
[44:18.78]More money.
[44:20.64]Can we get a bitrate pog face?
[44:22.68]Yeah.
[44:32.19]Too quiet now?
[44:47.92]Holy shit, I forgot about this thing.
[44:52.85]This was actually a great start.
[44:54.45]This was a great start.
[44:55.51]Alright, I gotta turn on hyper mode next time.
[45:05.56]You want me to do, like, hard mode?
[45:08.00]I'll try it.
[45:30.76]Facecam's too big.
[45:49.57]There.
[45:54.43]It's still too big.
[46:01.73]No, guys, I'm not muting my mic.
[46:05.93]No, I want to do some new content.
[46:12.01]I'm not muting my mic.
[46:14.58]I want to do some new content.
[46:16.92]And yeah, you've known me over the last five to ten years, being the long play, no commentary and everything.
[46:22.68]But today I wanted to talk.
[46:32.63]Why is this such a big deal?
[46:33.59]I don't know.
[46:33.98]I don't understand why.
[46:34.78]I want to change, like, kind of what I'm doing and not just do, like, no commentary.
[46:43.98]There's a lot of people there.
[46:44.82]I figured I would see if anyone still, like, cannot hear me talk and everything.
[46:53.06]If you don't like it, then just fucking leave, okay?
[46:55.00]How's that sound?
[46:57.93]I'm doing it.
[46:58.43]I'm taking my channel in a new direction.
[47:00.69]It's commentary.
[47:02.99]I know the title says that, but I'll change the title.
[47:17.62]Rip 200 people.
[47:18.38]Why is it 200 people?
[47:19.10]I don't get it.
[47:30.05]We made you.
[47:34.45]We made you.
[47:41.03]You know what I would want to do so bad?
[47:44.92]I would want to do a like long play, no commentary video.
[47:48.14]And it's like six hours long and it's a game.
[47:51.02]But somewhere in the middle, just do this huge shitty mic quality burp.
[47:57.27]It's just like, what the... Holy shit, what was that?
[48:04.48]Just like a... And that's it.
[48:13.17]And like, or have it be like a plate of food.
[48:16.39]Like, metal onto ceramic.
[48:22.73]He's eating a chicken parm or something, but he's not talking.
[48:26.21]Just once for like 10 minutes in the middle.
[48:35.26]That'd be so weird.
[48:46.17]Yeah, you hear a lawnmower open up in the background.
[48:48.57]Yep.
[49:02.67]oh my god wonder what it's gonna be holy shit imagine getting this like 10 to 20 minutes ago I'll take the money
[49:27.46]How can we look like a simulation?
[49:31.90]You can't do that in a simulation.
[49:33.36]Stop.
[49:34.90]Graphics have not gotten that far.
[49:55.69]Damn.
[49:55.91]Alright, I'm almost at 30 minutes.
[50:04.08]I'm making so much money.
[50:19.22]This is what space invaders look like to a three year old me.
[50:33.78]Why?
[50:34.06]Just turn your bitrate down.
[50:49.15]Turn off the damage numbers so you can see better.
[50:50.81]I kind of like the damage numbers though.
[50:53.18]Well, not this late, but it helps to know how much you're doing.
[51:06.98]I'm watching this at 160.
[51:07.68]Alright, we're going hard mode next time.
[51:20.76]I'm going to turn on hyper and I'm going to do first mode.
[51:24.69]See how crazy we can make it.
[51:25.49]Alright, and I got one minute.
[51:36.75]One minute to get as much money as I can.
[52:08.94]I gotta get out of this area here.
[52:10.14]There's so much experience down there.
[52:13.31]I'm going for it.
[52:36.64]I did it!
[52:41.91]I did it.
[52:42.27]Hooray.
[52:51.95]Oh, I get to revive, right, because of the thing I bought.
[52:54.47]Let's go.
[53:04.22]Ooh, I unlocked Cavallo.
[53:08.46]Reach level 100 with... Unlocks Reroll.
[53:12.09]Reach level 40.
[53:13.45]Unlock Dairy Plant.
[53:15.25]Unlocks Banish.
[53:19.39]Alright, I got a new character.
[53:21.97]Evolve the Rune Tracer.
[53:24.65]You can see how much damage things were doing.
[53:26.21]Looks like the Bloody Tear was doing a lot.
[53:30.21]Alright, I gotta try Cavallo.
[53:33.72]This is pretty fun, man.
[53:34.72]This is a pretty fun game.
[53:37.76]Alright, what's Cuscavalo?
[53:40.34]Gets more projectiles every 20 levels.
[53:44.04]And he starts with... What is that?
[53:48.81]He's functionally identical.
[53:50.23]What is this weapon?
[53:56.47]This is a new weapon?
[53:59.09]It's a cherry bomb.
[54:02.27]I'll try it.
[54:03.04]That sounds cool.
[54:04.86]Alright, so this guy, let me see, this is more projectiles every 20 levels.
[54:09.75]So we want to do projectiles.
[54:12.97]So let's refund this here.
[54:13.87]So we're obviously going to do this because one more projectile is just great off the bat.
[54:20.06]So if we're going to be based on projectiles, I want to do projectile speed.
[54:25.32]Damage.
[54:30.30]I'll do move speed too.
[54:35.51]A little bit of curse.
[54:37.43]Yeah, cooldown as well.
[54:46.01]Banish!
[54:47.80]Oh, these are new.
[54:48.26]These are new.
[54:51.86]Once per rank allows to remove an item from level up choices for the rest of the run.
[54:59.47]So what, I can say I don't ever want to see this again?
[55:03.47]Once per rank allows to get different choices when leveling up.
[55:07.05]So I can reroll a choice.
[55:08.03]That's a lot of money, though.
[55:09.67]11,000?
[55:09.75]This is kind of cheap, right?
[55:17.34]Reroll is stupid.
[55:19.56]It's almost half the money I have, though.
[55:26.80]Should I do curse?
[55:28.74]Or should I wait to do curse and do it later?
[55:32.49]I'll do 20%.
[55:33.69]I like that.
[55:40.13]I want luck too.
[55:48.47]Magnet maybe.
[55:51.43]Area.
[55:52.63]Yeah.
[55:54.51]Max health.
[56:02.44]Breed.
[56:02.70]Alright, that's fine.
[56:05.78]Okay.
[56:08.21]So I'll try Cavallo.
[56:09.55]Alright, this is a new weapon.
[56:13.45]Dairy Plant.
[56:15.89]The magic map hidden in here might finally lead us to a vampire or at least to more roast chicken.
[56:20.42]Dairy Plant.
[56:20.96]This is new.
[56:22.64]Am I standing up?
[56:32.33]Let's do it.
[56:36.79]So how- What is this move?
[56:41.80]So it is- Okay, it is- Whoa, it exploded.
[56:43.66]Why did it explode?
[56:45.98]They blow up.
[56:46.94]Alright, that's cool.
[56:51.14]I- Okay, I made the game 20% harder.
[56:53.12]Man, oh, gollick.
[56:55.65]Definitely gollick.
[56:56.95]No, no, I don't.
[56:57.57]I want projectiles.
[56:58.43]What's- This is not a projectile, though.
[57:01.94]Santa water again, probably.
[57:02.93]I like garlic.
[57:03.35]Let's do garlic.
[57:03.99]I love garlic.
[57:06.31]So how garlic functions is, see, it just does this big zone around you.
[57:10.36]I know this is not the build to do garlic, but whatever.
[57:14.04]I like it.
[57:14.39]It's my favorite.
[57:27.11]Is there a chest already?
[57:27.85]Alright, here we go.
[57:29.59]Projectiles.
[57:30.49]Do I want to do axe or knife?
[57:34.09]Probably knife.
[57:34.47]I would say knife.
[57:37.94]Or rune tracer.
[57:39.00]Again.
[57:43.02]Yeah, rune tracer is just too good.
[57:45.14]Just too good.
[57:45.48]Do I have any wings?
[57:53.05]Is this technically a projectile?
[57:56.48]Because this is a bird fly around you.
[57:57.88]You need to do two different birds.
[58:01.10]Is that a projectile?
[58:04.12]Or is that kind of something else?
[58:10.87]Yes.
[58:11.87]Bird is a projectile.
[58:12.75]Okay.
[58:15.44]Bird is kind of hard to use early, but late game it's stupid.
[58:26.56]Oh shit, alright.
[58:32.56]Is there- is there a map hidden here it said?
[58:34.22]Should I go looking for it?
[58:35.04]Holy shit.
[58:44.61]Thank god for garlic.
[58:46.03]Otherwise I probably would have gotten killed.
[58:47.30]Oh sorry, killed.
[58:56.74]I probably would have gotten killed.
[58:59.72]More cherry bomb?
[59:02.74]Does cherry bomb have an evolution?
[59:11.07]What's the cherry bomb evolution?
[59:14.21]No?
[59:15.11]Oh, shit.
[59:15.99]Okay, well.
[59:18.41]I'm gonna do it.
[59:23.80]It's a great weapon though.
[59:25.00]Seems like it.
[59:25.38]Seems really good.
[59:44.85]Chest.
[59:45.79]Alright, give me a legendary right now.
[59:50.22]Garlic.
[59:53.34]Legendary.
[59:56.40]Garlic again.
[59:56.90]That's actually awesome.
[59:58.14]He's ignoring us?
[59:58.92]No, I'm not.
[59:59.48]I'm looking over here every, like, 15 seconds.
[60:04.45]For a bit, Jerma, you should relaunch the stream at, like, 3,000 up and see how crusty it is.
[60:15.23]Didn't I do that one time?
[60:18.04]I remember back in, like, 2016 when I was first starting streaming.
[60:23.27]Oh, definitely Bible.
[60:25.25]I remember playing Overwatch at 100k up.
[60:34.35]I have to get the other bird.
[60:39.15]I can't do anything else.
[60:40.43]No more new weapons.
[60:41.19]It has to be the other bird.
[60:46.27]Garlic, Bible, Tome, Speed equal... Yeah.
[60:52.50]Alright, what do I need here?
[60:53.60]I need... Garlic and what?
[61:07.39]Garlic and... something else.
[61:19.22]Garnish the garlic?
[61:20.04]I like garlic.
[61:22.59]Here we go.
[61:23.03]Alright.
[61:23.53]So this is... Pumarola is the evolution for Garlic.
[61:27.65]I'm gonna get that.
[61:30.67]This is my first stream that I'm watching.
[61:32.41]Really?
[61:32.71]What's up?
[61:34.33]How you doing?
[61:36.84]Welcome to the stream.
[61:44.96]First stream too?
[61:45.60]Really?
[61:45.90]There's a lot of new viewers today.
[61:48.16]Where'd you come from?
[61:49.94]Where'd all you guys come from?
[61:58.79]Garlic again.
[62:02.49]Garlic saves your life.
[62:03.69]It really does.
[62:04.21]I would have gotten hit probably three or four more times already.
[62:15.32]I came from... what?
[62:20.99]Gotta stay hydrated.
[62:21.63]It's a gaming sesh, man.
[62:26.27]Gotta stay hydrated.
[62:30.41]Blood looked like Doom, so I started watching and then this kept me here.
[62:32.81]Oh, cool.
[62:33.09]Alright.
[62:40.71]Is there the bird?
[62:42.19]Alright.
[62:43.05]Now we gotta get the birds up.
[63:01.45]Watch out for this Minotaur.
[63:07.57]Wait, it didn't drop anything yet?
[63:13.49]It just popped into the screen.
[63:14.82]I'm already considered buying it.
[63:17.68]Yeah.
[63:19.90]I'm curious how many hours I have in this game.
[63:25.32]Should I just get the Duplicator just because?
[63:28.99]Garlic and... Okay.
[63:33.28]It's like one of the best items in the whole game.
[63:34.70]Of course I am.
[63:36.32]Nice.
[63:36.84]Here we go.
[63:42.90]Very good.
[63:43.62]I'll take it.
[63:52.00]Yeah, no reason to pass it up ever.
[64:01.01]How high is Garlic?
[64:01.91]Level 6 or something?
[64:04.97]Alright.
[64:06.51]The Bible is... Let me look at my cheat sheet.
[64:17.52]Bible?
[64:19.68]And Spellbinder?
[64:23.28]And then it's Garlic.
[64:27.06]And Heart, I already have it.
[64:28.26]And then it's... Rune Tracer and...
[64:36.68]Armor.
[64:37.02]Okay.
[64:41.50]So I need armor.
[64:43.64]And I need... Spellbinder.
[64:46.76]And then we're good to go.
[64:53.30]For a while.
[65:01.73]I wonder if I should just get this too.
[65:04.93]Will I have enough?
[65:06.72]I need one, two, three.
[65:10.22]I'll have enough.
[65:10.82]Yeah, I'm just going to get it.
[65:11.84]Just straight up damage is insane.
[65:15.08]I'm done doing it.
[65:18.92]That's going to be like 50% more damage.
[65:27.75]What I was going to say is I've already played this game a lot.
[65:30.71]The really slow burn of progression in this game is really, really, really fun.
[65:36.44]Unlocking each new thing and kind of getting better and better and better and better.
[65:39.36]It's awesome.
[65:39.76]Okay, I can't do that.
[65:43.53]We'll do this.
[65:44.55]Yeah.
[65:54.59]Also, Ranex in chat made a lot of the pixel art for the game.
[65:59.53]Are they still here?
[66:00.13]Really?
[66:03.91]That's pretty awesome.
[66:04.82]Is he still here?
[66:11.26]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[66:25.39]Okay, cherry bomb.
[66:26.73]No.
[66:27.47]Yeah.
[66:29.97]Spinach.
[66:34.41]I'm not entirely confident.
[66:35.55]I think I screwed this up a little bit.
[66:36.55]It's alright.
[66:36.95]Alright, here we go.
[66:37.99]Spellbinder.
[66:38.45]Hell yeah.
[66:40.73]I can get the Bible now.
[66:43.59]Did I need wings for anything?
[66:45.91]No, right?
[66:46.33]I don't think so.
[66:51.64]How come you're a sloth?
[66:53.16]Do you think I look like a sloth?
[66:54.20]I don't know.
[67:02.02]Oh, I thought you were talking about me and the camera in the top right.
[67:04.34]I was like, I don't know.
[67:04.98]Do you think I look like a sloth?
[67:07.08]I kind of could see it for a second.
[67:08.65]That's why I didn't say anything.
[67:12.24]I kind of like, I was like, yeah, I guess like I kind of, maybe I do a little.
[67:14.92]I don't know.
[67:17.13]You're talking about that as a panda.
[67:18.21]One second.
[67:30.25]Who can complain about damage?
[67:37.46]Oh, fuck.
[67:37.94]Okay, I need health.
[67:41.26]Is there health down here?
[67:44.74]I did make the game 20% harder.
[67:46.22]So... I gotta be careful.
[67:54.22]Jesus.
[68:11.22]How far down is this?
[68:12.06]Where the hell is this thing?
[68:16.28]Did I even go all the way down here?
[68:19.57]When did I come down here?
[68:22.35]It's so far away.
[68:22.95]I'm not touching that yet.
[68:30.27]How far?
[68:30.73]What the hell?
[68:32.61]Oh, the title needs to change.
[68:33.97]Oh, shit.
[68:34.43]I'm probably like dumping viewers.
[68:36.56]I'm dumping fucking viewers right now.
[68:39.52]The title is still there.
[68:41.28]I forgot about the title.
[68:45.90]People probably are coming and they're like, ah, am I dumping?
[68:48.82]No, I haven't lost that many.
[68:51.26]Hold on, I gotta change this.
[68:52.10]How about 160p is fine, relax.
[69:16.04]That's better, right?
[69:27.36]I'm leaving because you talked.
[69:28.78]Alright, we got the upgrade.
[69:30.35]Let's go.
[69:33.95]Let's go.
[69:34.41]I need to minimize this window, but I can't.
[69:50.04]I love the garlic and the Bible, which is awesome.
[69:52.04]It's like the double rings.
[69:57.38]Hell yeah.
[69:58.80]You can play Kirby's Air Ride, maybe?
[70:06.57]Hey, it was free.
[70:08.31]I'll take upgrades.
[70:15.09]you make the webcam 160p I I could try I don't think I can let's find out yeah I can
[71:11.38]There's no difference?
[71:13.64]This is at 160p.
[71:30.25]It's not that bad.
[71:32.83]Could be worse.
[71:40.90]Why do I look cross-eyed?
[71:41.98]Oh, it's because my eye is, like, drifting this way.
[71:48.89]Make your voice look robotic?
[71:50.51]No.
[72:06.56]It doesn't like movement, right?
[72:19.69]Doomguy?
[72:20.39]I can't- can I change this back?
[72:42.77]Fuck.
[72:43.13]Can I even change this back?
[72:44.03]What was it before? 720?
[72:50.92]Yeah, it was like, no, it was 1080, wasn't it?
[73:04.27]Yeah, it was 1080.
[73:04.55]Did I bring it back?
[73:15.16]Where is it?
[73:26.31]What the fuck?
[73:30.57]What happened?
[73:36.01]What happened?
[73:37.00]That was weird.
[73:42.90]This is very weird.
[73:43.92]Why is it like this?
[73:45.28]I tried to make it... Okay, there we go.
[73:46.38]Alright, we're back.
[74:03.97]That's fine.
[74:04.31]Alright, I gotta get back into this.
[74:06.89]I only.
[74:07.45]No, no.
[74:08.09]I only.
[74:08.53]That's fucking stupid.
[74:09.89]That's cringe.
[74:11.65]Are you cringe?
[74:12.99]Okay.
[74:13.61]You sure?
[74:14.81]No.
[74:15.05]You sure?
[74:15.39]Okay.
[74:31.30]There's no enemies here.
[74:32.26]Why did I pick this up?
[74:33.04]That was stupid.
[74:40.10]You save that when there's too many things on the screen.
[74:41.76]You just get a ton of EXP really quick.
[74:46.31]I still don't know what's down here, but I don't remember being down here.
[74:54.75]Webcam looks worse?
[74:55.93]No, it doesn't.
[75:01.06]Okay, people said you should get a better webcam.
[75:02.82]I don't want a better camera.
[75:07.44]You can see every inch of my ugly face if I had a very expensive DSLR or something.
[75:14.06]No, no thank you.
[75:16.16]No thanks.
[75:20.40]You'd be able to see the nose hairs I have.
[75:22.11]I don't know.
[75:22.81]I don't want you to see that.
[75:31.93]I'm actually confused.
[75:32.97]Where is this thing?
[75:46.74]I want this thing to die.
[75:47.98]Oh shit.
[75:53.40]Die already, please.
[75:59.68]Oh my god, die.
[76:00.60]Uh oh.
[76:12.30]Alright, that's a good.
[76:14.80]I'll take it.
[76:19.48]I need to break like a box or something because I'm dead.
[76:21.54]Are there boxes?
[76:33.60]I know that this box is in the world, but where are they?
[76:35.46]What do they look like on this map?
[76:42.27]What the fuck?
[76:42.95]I can't go that way.
[76:50.83]Oh, there's a magic map!
[76:52.22]That's what it is!
[76:54.26]Permanently enables the map in the pause menu.
[76:58.16]What?
[77:03.72]What does this mean?
[77:06.34]What's that mean?
[77:08.94]I'm dead.
[77:21.19]Well, I got the unlockable.
[77:28.16]I gotta beat it with a bear.
[77:32.18]Do it again.
[77:32.70]Do it again.
[77:33.06]Come on, come on, come on.
[77:34.82]Let's go.
[77:35.16]Alright, no fucking around.
[77:35.96]Let's go.
[77:36.44]I'm ready.
[77:43.78]Axe.
[77:46.18]Projectiles.
[77:50.13]This is a Rick and Morty theme song.
[77:53.88]Alright, no garlic.
[78:09.23]It didn't help us.
[78:09.99]Knife.
[78:10.19]I'm not making a stupid joke.
[78:16.15]That's what it just sounded like.
[78:29.40]How many seasons do you think Rick and Morty's gonna go before they cancel it?
[78:32.86]Or do you think they will cancel it?
[78:33.96]Do you think it'll go as long as, like, The Simpsons?
[78:37.51]What do you think?
[78:46.41]Maybe one or two more?
[78:55.06]What is it at now?
[78:55.66]Season five?
[78:56.68]I bet you it goes to season seven.
[79:07.63]The merch alone makes Adult Swim millions.
[79:11.75]Yeah.
[79:12.77]Hell yeah.
[79:13.09]I got the bracers.
[79:13.87]Let's go.
[79:14.21]Alright.
[79:35.81]I'm kind of getting shit on here.
[79:51.77]Ooh, that actually worked really well.
[79:59.16]Fuck.
[80:10.22]Knife.
[80:11.90]I need damage now.
[80:13.26]Or else it's a dead run.
[80:23.30]I need damage now, this is a dead run.
[80:32.08]You picked up the worst item in the game?
[80:33.62]Uh, ba ba ba, that's all I hear.
[80:53.62]You just picked up the worst item in the game.
[80:54.80]What item?
[80:55.44]The knife?
[80:55.88]It's a challenge run, dude.
[80:58.26]Are the barrels open?
[81:13.56]Oh, Jesus.
[81:20.09]No!
[81:20.73]Fuck!
[81:21.23]I'm dead.
[81:21.65]This place is hard.
[81:26.38]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[81:37.25]I'll get it, I'll get it right now.
[81:41.41]Let's go.
[81:41.77]That's it.
[81:42.59]No more bullshit.
[81:43.39]No more bullshit.
[81:47.70]Fire.
[81:47.86]Fire.
[81:56.93]The lamp posts are the drop items.
[81:58.27]Thank you so much.
[81:59.45]I've never would have guessed it.
[82:05.61]It's okay.
[82:06.12]I don't like this level.
[82:09.14]Everything looks like it's on the same plane, but like I can't move over this.
[82:12.16]It's hard to tell.
[82:13.42]It's like that in a lot of places.
[82:17.13]Pentagram erases everything in sight.
[82:30.56]It's Ruin Tracer every time.
[82:43.59]Especially now that they can be upgraded.
[82:47.66]Put a webcam on the character.
[82:48.82]How am I going to do that?
[82:56.62]Yeah, Santa Waters is amazing.
[83:02.73]Check the map.
[83:05.71]I'm so confused.
[83:06.59]So what I could try the items that I can go get or something.
[83:10.61]So I need this for the Santa water.
[83:25.65]Pop left.
[83:30.56]You can go over the item cap if you get the items on the map.
[83:32.74]Really?
[83:37.26]So should I not pick this up?
[83:38.38]They're far away.
[83:39.64]Oh, okay.
[83:49.03]Um... Fire one, too.
[83:54.81]Move your webcam away from the level display?
[83:56.47]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[84:07.36]There we go.
[84:07.82]Alright, this is not a bad start.
[84:16.85]Could be better.
[84:17.31]I'm gonna ask for it.
[84:41.44]Oh, God.
[84:47.81]Alright.
[84:49.75]I need more damage.
[84:51.31]Fuck you!
[85:03.51]No!
[85:03.81]Man, the curse really does make the game so much harder.
[85:08.07]Because they're faster than me. 20%.
[85:16.28]Damn it.
[85:17.38]Fuck.
[85:38.93]Come on, something good.
[85:43.09]That's not bad, because that's 20% more damage.
[85:52.28]Oh shit, this is bad, really bad.
[85:55.92]Dude, fuck you, fuck!
[85:57.56]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[86:00.08]I gotta go.
[86:06.44]Dude, how am I supposed to get through that?
[86:09.76]What the fuck?
[86:14.30]I'm dead?
[86:15.74]No way!
[86:16.52]No fucking way!
[86:18.64]No way!
[86:20.40]Alright, I gotta take the curse off.
[86:21.41]This level's fucking hard.
[86:27.95]Yeah, I know.
[86:28.57]No way.
[86:28.97]Not here.
[86:45.78]Speed.
[86:48.08]Area.
[86:55.04]Oh wait, do the expensive upgrades first, right?
[86:56.80]So what's the most expensive?
[86:59.08]Probably this one.
[87:00.76]And then this one.
[87:04.40]And then... I want the damage, it's just so good.
[87:10.21]Cooldown's amazing.
[87:13.07]Speed is amazing.
[87:13.91]I need movement speed.
[87:15.51]Alright, now what do I want?
[87:16.91]Growth?
[87:18.33]Growth?
[87:25.77]Recovery is good too.
[87:26.83]Yeah.
[87:29.93]Cause that's, that's a pretty decent amount.
[87:32.47]Max health and growth.
[87:37.97]Growth and area.
[87:45.89]And okay.
[87:46.71]Alright.
[87:46.95]Can I do anything else?
[87:50.92]Greed.
[87:51.34]Okay.
[87:51.52]Alright.
[87:51.74]This is fine.
[87:56.09]Maybe I should have tried a different character.
[88:01.97]I like the starting with the lightning.
[88:03.27]It's great.
[88:06.64]Permanent plus 30% area starts with temporary cooldown bonus.
[88:10.10]30% area.
[88:10.60]10% more experience every five levels.
[88:17.24]That's huge.
[88:21.96]Permanent plus 40% duration and speed.
[88:24.46]This guy's so low as shit, though.
[88:30.87]I could probably still do it on the bear.
[88:32.31]I have to beat it on the bear.
[88:34.63]Don't I?
[88:35.41]Yeah, let's try it again.
[88:36.75]Alright, this time I don't have to curse.
[88:38.21]So now they're not like 20% more, 20% faster, 20% more damage.
[88:41.25]I'll be fine.
[88:47.57]Domino's pizza?
[88:48.13]What am I going to eat?
[89:00.58]Get the green one?
[89:01.34]Yeah.
[89:02.22]Keep forgetting.
[89:06.02]Alright.
[89:08.66]Cross or garlic?
[89:11.68]No.
[89:12.80]Cross.
[89:14.62]I like garlic, though.
[89:16.73]I'm doing it.
[89:17.03]Okay, now we'll do Pichon.
[89:32.54]I didn't mean to touch that, but I did.
[89:48.85]Raise Spinach.
[89:53.71]He and Garlic.
[89:55.09]Garlic is really good.
[89:57.59]It just helps.
[89:59.23]I can't like...
[90:02.16]Oh, I almost just threw up.
[90:05.62]Hey, Trioq!
[90:06.22]What's up?
[90:06.58]I didn't just puke.
[90:07.30]I'm fine.
[90:09.52]How you doing?
[90:18.51]Thanks for the raid, man.
[90:22.81]Appreciate it.
[90:23.27]We're playing Vampire Survivors.
[90:29.17]It's a good game.
[90:30.49]I don't know if Aatrox... Aatrox, have you played this?
[90:32.73]Have you played Vampire Survivors?
[90:40.71]No.
[90:41.37]No?
[90:43.01]I want to see it.
[90:43.93]Let's see it.
[90:45.55]I want to see Aatrox play Vampire Survivors.
[90:48.65]Don't you?
[90:48.97]Alright, Garlic.
[90:56.81]This game's awesome, by the way, if you've never played it.
[90:58.33]But, hey, thanks for the raid.
[90:59.47]Welcome, everybody.
[90:59.95]I know we're getting late here.
[91:02.83]If you just want to drop by and say hello.
[91:05.67]What's up?
[91:06.75]If you're going to leave, hope you have a good rest.
[91:08.91]Because it is pretty late.
[91:18.78]Alright.
[91:20.32]Does Clover actually upgrade to anything?
[91:22.56]Or what?
[91:24.79]You're ignoring your chat?
[91:25.79]I am not.
[91:26.57]I'm looking at you right now.
[91:28.38]That's literally me looking at you.
[91:32.68]It's the cross, okay?
[91:36.66]As it stands right now, I need... What do I need for garlic?
[91:38.92]I forget every time.
[91:42.44]I'm going to take the axe.
[91:46.26]This is going way smoother.
[91:51.05]Red heart, right.
[91:52.41]It'll tell you.
[91:53.01]It tells you.
[91:56.81]There it is.
[91:57.15]10% more area.
[92:00.75]We're going to get the axe up, hopefully.
[92:13.82]Garlic again.
[92:14.40]It's a huge area.
[92:23.39]Yeah.
[92:26.74]What does axe turn into?
[92:28.80]Oh shit, there it is.
[92:29.58]Fire wand.
[92:33.28]Yep.
[92:33.40]Alright.
[92:37.39]The seeds have been planted.
[92:42.97]This is the one.
[92:46.13]There's a major seizure warning late game here.
[92:48.51]Really?
[92:49.54]I turned off the... I checked the box that's to make the photosensitive... sensitivity mode active.
[93:00.49]I'm getting Laurel.
[93:03.01]Ignores my question.
[93:04.39]If he likes Radiohead.
[93:06.84]Yeah.
[93:12.46]Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[93:30.72]I told the story of how me and my friends used to jump around on a trampoline while that song was blasting.
[93:34.94]On a stereo.
[93:35.96]Next to the trampoline, right?
[93:36.88]Did I ever tell you guys that story?
[93:43.46]I did, okay.
[93:44.00]Yeah, just making sure.
[93:44.66]You know?
[93:48.95]We would be just jumping.
[93:50.03]It was like three or four of us just jumping in a circle.
[93:53.07]They're like... It was... The stereo was just kind of far away.
[94:01.98]It was next to the trampoline, but far enough away.
[94:04.90]Yeah, paranoid android.
[94:14.77]Dude, nothing will, I think, ever compare to doing the trampoline jump in a circle thing while a CD is just blasting next to the trampoline.
[94:41.62]Give me it.
[94:44.94]Oh my God.
[94:48.14]Legendary.
[94:49.26]If you're like 12, that's cool.
[94:50.80]That's what I said when you were a kid.
[94:57.70]That's huge.
[95:02.71]Huge.
[95:10.77]Oh, that's huge.
[95:21.55]This is looking like a pretty good one so far.
[95:33.23]Connor is permanently in your head rent free.
[95:36.14]But the huge thing.
[95:37.16]I love numbers.
[95:46.26]How much does this game cost?
[95:47.44]It looks really fun.
[95:49.06]Well, I have got a really, really good news for you.
[95:52.00]This game is not $20.
[95:53.14]It's not $15.
[95:54.94]It's not even $10.
[95:59.00]This game can be yours for one easy payment of $2.99.
[96:04.16]That's right.
[96:06.99]That is right.
[96:07.43]That wasn't a typo.
[96:08.29]It's $3.00.
[96:18.01]For the amount that it costs for you to buy three hash browns from McDonald's will get you this game.
[96:28.66]Oh, fuck!
[96:29.16]I can't... You're right.
[96:30.58]I can't revolve the bird.
[96:31.56]Uh-oh.
[96:34.98]It's alright.
[96:35.94]I still got it.
[96:39.03]Shit.
[96:39.33]It's okay.
[96:43.63]It's alright.
[96:44.09]I got enough.
[96:44.45]I wasn't paying attention.
[96:50.10]The run is ruined?
[96:50.84]I think I'll be fine.
[97:09.72]It's alright.
[97:10.22]It's gonna be a garlic carry anyways.
[97:25.88]Where'd they go?
[97:42.25]Alright, give me another legendary.
[97:47.20]Garlic.
[97:48.60]Legendary!
[97:49.48]Why would you buy less than three hash browns?
[97:55.24]I mean, McDonald's breakfast is just one of those things where you completely forget it exists until for some reason you're just up at like 6 o'clock in the morning and you're like, yo, that's what we're doing right now.
[98:14.93]McDonald's is so ridiculous.
[98:16.23]I mean, other places do this too, but McDonald's just has two completely different operating menus.
[98:23.02]It's crazy.
[98:25.73]The McDonald's breakfast menu?
[98:28.27]It's just like a completely different restaurant.
[98:32.50]And some could argue it's... Okay, this is... Hold on.
[98:34.12]Quiet.
[98:34.30]It's not you, me.
[98:35.42]Alright, we're good.
[98:44.18]It's so expensive.
[98:46.07]Is the breakfast stuff more expensive than... Okay, is like a double cheeseburger from McDonald's more expensive than a sausage egg McMuffin?
[98:53.17]Or are they the same?
[98:53.99]Okay.
[99:02.85]McMuffin is more.
[99:06.89]Is it really?
[99:07.75]It's about the same.
[99:08.51]I wonder why.
[99:08.93]Maybe it's the ingredients.
[99:12.02]Doesn't McDonald's use real cracked eggs?
[99:15.60]Like a real egg that they have to actually crack it in the morning, right?
[99:24.29]No, they do.
[99:24.61]Yeah, they do.
[99:27.73]It's only for some of the stuff, yeah.
[99:29.23]But like a sausage egg McMuffin has like a... They crack it into a little thing and cook it there.
[99:36.08]I'm almost certain they do.
[99:40.88]God damn it, I'm sorry.
[99:41.54]I keep punching you.
[99:46.10]They do, yeah.
[99:48.10]They have real and they have fake.
[99:49.46]Yeah.
[99:50.62]That's what I mean.
[99:51.10]Like it's... Some of the items have like... Somebody actually has to crack the egg and cook it.
[100:05.17]You guys ever just get in the mood where you just want to crack like three eggs in a pan and just like flip them up over easy and just eat each egg in one bite.
[100:16.05]Does anybody else do that?
[100:21.04]I take each egg and I go scoop it up.
[100:24.94]I fold it in my mouth and I eat the whole egg in one bite and just kind of let it just kind of mush it around.
[100:30.38]It's so good.
[100:31.46]I love doing that.
[100:34.96]I love it.
[100:37.78]Because I don't like when the yolk breaks and gets all over everything else.
[100:41.94]I don't like that.
[100:43.97]If I have eggs on a plate, let's say if I go to a breakfast place or if I'm going to have eggs in the morning or something, those eggs are being eaten in one bite.
[100:56.48]Why are you a snake?
[101:09.80]I mean, you don't, you know, I'm not talking about like you, like, no, you pick it up and you like fold it up and you let it, you eat it.
[101:33.06]I don't like when the yolk breaks and gets all over everything else.
[101:38.45]I like enjoying an over easy egg completely on its own with the yolk and the white at the same time.
[101:52.88]Now there is an exception, right?
[101:55.66]If you eat sort of around the yolk, you don't break it.
[102:01.30]I do that too.
[102:02.62]So the egg white kind of around the middle.
[102:06.88]Can't go that way.
[102:09.34]I'll eat that, and then you just take the whole yolk that has a little bit of the white surrounding it, and you eat the whole thing in one bite.
[102:17.66]How do you guys eat your eggs?
[102:20.04]Let me guess, you guys like, cut, cut, cut, cut, spread, spread, spread, and then it touches all your other food.
[102:25.67]And then after about five minutes, you have this cold yolk, this cold, gooey liquid all over all your other shit.
[102:39.48]Yuck.
[102:53.07]Omelettes are better.
[102:53.65]Omelettes are amazing.
[102:55.23]Those are incredible.
[102:59.03]The yolk is like extra sauce.
[103:06.46]Yeah, I would feel that way if it didn't turn in... Okay, yolk, when it's broken after a few minutes, changes.
[103:14.02]It turns into this half kind of solid congealed liquid, but not liquid.
[103:20.33]Sometimes it like hard... I don't know.
[103:29.47]Hard-boiled eggs are amazing, but you have to eat them right when you make them.
[103:35.23]I would still eat hardboiled... We already went over the hardboiled egg stuff, right?
[103:39.31]Hold on, I don't want to die.
[103:46.78]How have I not gotten anything to upgrade these yet?
[103:49.12]That's kind of insane.
[103:52.92]Deviled eggs are amazing.
[103:53.76]Deviled eggs can be incredible.
[103:57.04]But they gotta be fresh.
[104:01.67]I'll be the first person in line when the deviled eggs come out.
[104:04.15]And I'll be the last person in line when they've been out for more than 5 to 10 minutes.
[104:10.45]Like after a deviled egg has been out for like 20 minutes.
[104:12.89]Nope.
[104:15.65]We've been over this already.
[104:16.47]Yeah, but there's new people here.
[104:29.70]So much experience here.
[104:38.70]Yeah, eat food however you want, right?
[104:40.76]I'm just telling you how I do it.
[104:42.38]And how you do it is wrong.
[104:45.96]Right, that's the point.
[104:52.32]How come you're the panda?
[104:53.78]I'm the panda.
[105:02.07]The panda's move actually, when it's leveled up, is really good.
[105:07.85]The explosion is crazy.
[105:17.91]Get away from me, Jesus.
[105:26.18]Oh, fuck.
[105:26.78]Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
[105:44.83]I forgot I got that, thank god.
[105:52.65]Shit's not dying fast enough.
[105:54.93]Oh boy, this is it.
[105:58.93]Oh, that's it, say goodbye.
[105:59.83]I need survivability right now.
[106:09.99]No way, I'm not getting out of this.
[106:12.13]No fucking way, it's over.
[106:20.35]Shit, I wish there was one of those items in the ground one of those like breathing fire items Look at how much shit would be over this would be crazy if I could just have something show up right now However, I haven't gotten anything to upgrade these I
[106:52.08]That seems impossible.
[106:58.92]Really?
[106:59.20]This thing's the highest.
[107:17.51]I mean, I gotta get it up.
[107:25.20]Oh God.
[107:40.03]Alright, here we go.
[107:41.35]I need a chest right now.
[107:45.65]Please give me a chest.
[107:47.59]That's a garlic evolution right there.
[107:51.18]I'm in so much trouble.
[107:52.34]This is bad.
[107:52.94]This is so much.
[107:53.94]I'm in so much trouble.
[107:56.42]I need to chest right now, dude.
[108:00.08]Axe.
[108:04.90]God damn it.
[108:12.13]Axe again.
[108:22.51]Try to get this.
[108:26.86]I feel like I should just get it.
[108:34.36]I'm kind of afraid that I'm going to die.
[108:48.79]Holy shit.
[108:49.65]Okay.
[108:57.66]I don't want to take up slots.
[109:00.16]I have to get the thing in the middle.
[109:04.56]Because I need... For the axe.
[109:11.94]Candle improves garlic.
[109:14.26]Yeah, but I need the axe upgrade.
[109:16.28]What's the... I already have it?
[109:19.34]I'm missing something.
[109:19.98]What am I missing?
[109:24.74]Bracer is probably pretty good here.
[109:27.78]Doesn't pair with anything, though.
[109:34.62]Candle and axe.
[109:38.84]If I die, that tiramisu goes away, right?
[109:41.10]I think I'm just going to take this.
[109:45.72]I can't make a decision.
[109:48.86]The other bird, I can't take the other bird because I messed up and took too many weapons.
[109:51.89]I'm just going to go with this.
[109:54.45]I can't make a decision right now.
[110:04.47]Alright, I survived that.
[110:05.47]I should be alright.
[110:08.13]Duplicator.
[110:09.13]Dude, come on.
[110:13.19]I need to do... But I need to do Axe.
[110:22.54]I have to evolve something.
[110:23.50]I'm at almost 15 minutes and I don't have anything evolved.
[110:34.69]Okay, axe.
[110:47.98]Jesus.
[110:50.66]Get away from me.
[110:55.42]Alright, finally, axe level 8.
[110:56.60]I need a chest.
[110:58.33]Can I spawn a chest, for God's sakes?
[111:04.13]I need something to evolve.
[111:11.20]Holy shit!
[111:12.14]I forgot they were on screen.
[111:13.12]I'm an idiot.
[111:31.41]I think I'm going to get this.
[111:35.65]go alright finally run saved there it is the side death spiral evolved axe passes through enemies and it's huge if I remember
[112:04.51]It's gigantic if I remember.
[112:06.91]Oh, yeah.
[112:11.06]I really kind of wish I had cooldown.
[112:12.40]I don't have anything at max level.
[112:27.59]Do I?
[112:27.87]That can be evolved?
[112:30.89]I have... Oh, no.
[112:32.01]Yeah, I do.
[112:32.43]Garlic.
[112:32.61]Garlic.
[112:38.10]Get me up there, please.
[112:45.52]Hell yeah.
[112:47.99]Steals hearts?
[112:49.15]Power increases when recovering HP.
[112:54.19]So it's like a lifesteal, right?
[112:55.19]Let's get this up.
[113:01.81]Alright, run and save.
[113:05.09]I need... I need a lot... Okay, I need a lot more in fire.
[113:09.48]I'm just gonna get this chest, because I feel like... Yeah, okay, that was perfect.
[113:16.62]Because I got a long way to go on the fire wand.
[113:19.51]Really?
[113:20.23]That's kind of absolute dog shit.
[113:23.95]Oh well.
[113:24.59]Okay, whatever.
[113:44.33]Yeah, I haven't seen any fire one.
[113:45.59]Yeah, just get the cherry bomb up, Max.
[113:59.26]Take that, please.
[114:05.08]Not even one level, really?
[114:38.79]Another duplicator.
[114:39.85]Oh, I have to.
[114:40.35]I have to.
[114:54.04]Wake up?
[114:54.46]What?
[114:57.00]Go to the question mark on the map.
[114:59.00]I'll try to get there.
[115:01.24]Why does it say wake up?
[115:02.56]Why did my voice just do that?
[115:04.80]That was weird.
[115:07.66]Alright, I'm going to make my way to the question mark.
[115:08.90]I didn't want to touch that, but I did.
[115:24.74]Wake up, hurry up.
[115:26.78]It's almost time for bed, okay?
[115:32.44]Base area 25 base damage.
[115:33.94]Alright, that's max.
[115:37.22]That's actually incredible.
[115:39.98]I talked a lot of shit about that up weapon, but that's really good.
[115:47.37]The area of it, that explosion area is massive.
[115:50.29]I have to just go to bed.
[115:53.65]I'll do like, no, not yet.
[115:54.97]I'll do a few more.
[115:55.75]Maybe like one or two more.
[115:58.93]I want to see what I unlock from this.
[116:01.66]because I'm definitely gonna unlock something if I beat this.
[116:04.81]So not quite.
[116:07.17]Am I still... I still need to do the fire wand.
[116:14.90]Alright, I'm gonna try to get to the question mark.
[116:31.40]That's really far away, but let's see if I can get there.
[116:33.32]Why are you trying to send a 36 year old man to bed?
[116:44.79]I don't want to go to bed!
[116:51.91]You go to bed right this instant, mister.
[116:55.15]Right now.
[116:59.37]I will in a little bit.
[117:01.35]Maybe one or two more.
[117:09.52]How's that?
[117:17.20]I'm just going to make a line to that.
[117:19.17]Alright, I'm getting there.
[117:21.97]Just stay.
[117:22.25]I'm going to go this way.
[117:23.15]Be careful.
[117:24.01]Don't be an idiot.
[117:31.26]10 more minutes.
[117:32.24]It's going to be close.
[117:32.98]I feel like I'm not clearing that fast like I was in the first run.
[117:47.71]Give me that.
[117:56.43]Fuck.
[118:01.62]Is your stream?
[118:02.08]You should go as long as you want.
[118:03.40]Yeah, oh yeah.
[118:05.00]No, I'm good.
[118:05.38]I'll be good for a little while.
[118:08.00]I told you, we're just winding down here.
[118:09.68]This is the chill part of the stream.
[118:13.60]See, we had three different streams today.
[118:16.32]We had, like, the kind of wild first two or three hours with that scary game.
[118:22.87]Then we had the middle gamer moments where I was playing the FPS gaming, and now we're in the chill mode.
[118:30.05]We don't talk about Glover.
[118:30.95]That didn't happen.
[118:57.04]Ooh, I definitely want that.
[118:58.40]That's going to kill everything in one hit.
[119:09.20]Pick up all the stuff.
[119:10.66]Hurry.
[119:14.71]That first run was seriously so good.
[119:17.55]That's exactly what you want to have happen every time.
[119:19.17]This one's not bad, though.
[119:30.16]luck.
[119:35.73]I don't understand what's happening.
[119:38.21]Uh, I'm walking around and things are dying.
[119:40.13]That's pretty much all you really need to know.
[119:41.73]Alright, eight minutes.
[119:49.09]Can I do it?
[119:51.19]How far?
[119:51.51]How close am I?
[119:52.17]Am I still that far away?
[119:57.28]Oh, oh.
[120:02.28]I think I'm going to be here for a while.
[120:09.62]Fire wand again.
[120:10.40]Just walk in a circle.
[120:23.74]Fire wand again.
[120:24.58]Base damage up.
[120:27.84]What is the fire?
[120:28.47]It turns into like a meteor or something, right?
[120:37.45]One more and I need a chest.
[120:47.70]There's no Glover footage to upload?
[120:52.44]What do you mean?
[120:52.96]Alright, there it is.
[121:01.88]And what do you know?
[121:03.89]Chest right here.
[121:09.12]It's like a meteor.
[121:10.60]Hellfire.
[121:11.36]Passes through enemies.
[121:12.38]Evolved Fire Wand.
[121:15.56]This thing's really deadly if I remember.
[121:17.32]Oh yeah, this thing's insane.
[121:18.34]Alright, I'm good to go.
[121:20.72]I should get to 30 minutes.
[121:21.36]I don't think there's a... I don't think there's a world where I don't.
[121:33.67]Almost maxed out here.
[121:36.99]And then it's just get money.
[121:49.24]Wait, what's a Gloffer?
[121:56.62]Don't go too far.
[121:57.43]There's no reason to go far because I'll miss out on money.
[122:01.97]At this stage, if you got a really insane build and you can't even do anything else, just stand in the middle and just collect money.
[122:10.80]This is pretty much a locked in win, I think.
[122:15.72]I could try to go get the question mark, but...
[122:20.88]I think I feel like I'm too far.
[122:24.74]Could I?
[122:28.59]Do you think I could?
[122:29.15]Could I get there in time?
[122:30.83]Do you think I'll make it?
[122:36.59]It might be too far.
[122:37.79]I'll try.
[122:37.99]Kind of just southeast.
[122:55.08]Maybe I can't make it.
[122:56.10]Five minutes.
[122:56.54]Yeah, I'll get it.
[123:13.26]Turn on map guides?
[123:16.36]Guide guides.
[123:17.02]Show guides.
[123:17.64]What?
[123:24.83]Oh, that's interesting.
[123:25.86]Okay.
[123:29.90]I gotta be careful here.
[123:30.92]I could die really quickly if I'm not... Okay, hold on.
[123:33.22]Stop moving.
[123:45.31]Is it a key?
[123:49.81]I wonder what that is.
[123:55.37]Even though I'm really powerful, you still, if I lose the laurel, you die in one second to these enemies.
[124:00.77]If they touch you, you lose 30-40% per second.
[124:05.34]You can die very easily right now.
[124:14.30]I have the two, yeah, right, I have two revives here, right?
[124:19.33]I shouldn't be all that concerned.
[124:25.28]Oh, Jesus.
[124:35.31]How close am I now?
[124:36.09]Alright, I'm almost there.
[124:37.93]There's a chest?
[124:38.61]Ah, fuck it, whatever.
[124:42.67]Nothing can be in there anyways.
[124:54.81]So what is it?
[125:04.40]It is... a coffin?
[125:08.76]What is it?
[125:11.50]What is this thing?
[125:19.95]Thank you, Yadacavallo.
[125:22.37]But the vampire is in another coffin.
[125:35.19]Poppia Picarina joins the survivors.
[125:37.77]Oh, it's a new character.
[125:38.39]Ooh, we're gonna check that out after this.
[125:43.19]Alright, now just live.
[125:45.22]Just survive.
[125:46.70]I mean, I could get this one.
[125:48.24]This is pretty close, I think.
[125:52.40]Eh, fuck it.
[125:57.92]just live you're gonna eat a glove on stream it's yeah it's it's currently midnight it's like three o'clock in the morning almost eastern on April 24th free stooges are not in Fortnite although I wonder what what legal battle was going on behind the scenes it was I don't know so I'm gonna have to eat a I'm gonna need a glove on screen whatever
[126:23.81]It's going to be so funny if the three stooges are announced in Fortnite in like five days.
[126:28.10]You have to eat a glove tomorrow.
[126:40.65]I'm not going to eat a glove tomorrow on stream.
[126:42.99]I'm not even going to stream tomorrow.
[126:47.09]That's just free money.
[126:55.99]You gotta give me a little bit of time to be able to find out what kind of glove I want to eat.
[127:00.13]So are we talking baseball glove?
[127:02.89]Are we talking surgical glove?
[127:04.84]Are we talking... What kind of glove are you talking about here?
[127:08.02]Like a mittens?
[127:09.20]Like a mitten for going outside in the snow?
[127:11.32]It has to be a glove or a glove.
[127:23.22]A Mickey Mouse glove?
[127:24.44]I'll go white.
[127:25.54]Just, ugh.
[127:32.68]A baseball glove?
[127:33.54]We'll have to do a poll.
[127:34.82]Alright mods, let's see a poll.
[127:35.98]I don't even have mods even here.
[127:38.85]It's really late.
[127:39.77]I would be surprised if there were a lot of mods here.
[127:45.73]Give it up for the mods by the way.
[127:50.25]It's very late.
[127:52.30]Alright, baseball glove.
[127:55.82]Mickey Mouse slash Glover glove.
[127:58.74]Big, okay, no.
[128:00.28]Baseball glove.
[128:02.03]Cartoon white glove.
[128:05.09]Surgical glove.
[128:07.33]Or winter mitten.
[128:12.71]There you go.
[128:17.17]Oh my goodness.
[128:40.29]That's a wall in front of me.
[128:41.39]That's a wall in front of me.
[128:48.58]That's a wall.
[128:49.28]I can't go down.
[128:49.86]I think I'm fine.
[128:59.24]Got it.
[129:20.74]Just give me the points.
[129:21.64]Nooo, dammit.
[129:30.80]Alright.
[129:31.71]Level 72.
[129:34.87]Master Hand Glove is Cartoon White Glove.
[129:39.69]Okay.
[129:40.69]Hyper Dairy Plant.
[129:43.91]Poppia.
[129:47.42]And... Gallo Tower.
[129:50.49]Very cool.
[129:54.13]Make a glove pizza?
[129:59.72]Hamburger Helper glove is white cartoon glove.
[130:02.78]It's Glover, Mickey Mouse, Hamburger Helper.
[130:06.56]They're all the same.
[130:08.68]Yeah, Glover counts as a cartoon glove.
[130:10.68]What is it at right now?
[130:13.44]Okay, so it looks like cartoon white glove.
[130:22.70]Survive 10 minutes with... Okay.
[130:28.34]Alright, what is, uh, Popia?
[130:30.86]Gains 1% duration every level?
[130:33.06]What does that mean?
[130:45.30]What does this move?
[130:48.54]The duration of her weapon effect.
[130:50.78]Ah!
[130:52.30]There's no maximum.
[130:53.70]That seems kind of insane.
[130:55.76]Holy water, bibles, bones, really?
[130:59.38]So I should do even more duration then.
[131:00.78]Okay, duration.
[131:04.11]30% more duration.
[131:08.97]More area.
[131:11.33]Projectile?
[131:13.41]I definitely want luck.
[131:17.26]Cooldown.
[131:20.45]Speed.
[131:25.87]Alright.
[131:26.51]It looks like it's going to be a cartoon white glove.
[131:39.36]Oh, that's way too much.
[131:40.06]On this again, I want... Should I even get the duplicate?
[131:49.02]Yeah, I guess so.
[132:00.62]What else do I even want?
[132:01.70]Growth is so important.
[132:11.39]Moving speed.
[132:12.03]I got 4,000.
[132:17.71]Advantage is cheap.
[132:20.01]I'll just take it.
[132:20.57]I think that's good.
[132:30.53]Alright, so we're looking for duration stuff.
[132:34.49]Duration.
[132:37.09]So, yeah.
[132:38.57]What is this?
[132:38.87]I'm interested in what this move is.
[132:42.12]Gallo Tower.
[132:44.96]I'll try Gallo Tower.
[132:45.78]Yeah, so eat a cartoon white glove.
[132:49.66]You got it.
[132:54.71]Whoa.
[132:55.01]Whoa.
[132:59.50]Okay, this thing is awesome.
[133:00.72]Does this have a level up?
[133:04.02]It evolves with the in-game curse item.
[133:11.17]What gloves should Jerma eat?
[133:12.33]No channel points this time?
[133:13.71]Wait, what?
[133:20.43]None of these have a duration.
[133:30.15]Axe, maybe.
[133:31.05]Or whip.
[133:34.41]Mmm, cross is good.
[133:38.61]This weapon is awesome, though.
[133:39.75]Alright, duration.
[133:46.07]Do I have any wings?
[133:47.54]Is that duration?
[133:48.62]I think it is, right?
[133:49.28]Alright, this time don't screw this up.
[133:54.62]And get the other bird.
[134:00.33]Is this a really small area?
[134:01.99]Or is it just vertical?
[134:04.83]This is a great character to take here because it's vertical.
[134:10.92]Let me cross again.
[134:25.60]Song of Mana.
[134:26.71]Base area up 100%.
[134:31.47]Uh, this thing is like S tier.
[134:33.69]This is insane.
[134:36.37]Can anybody else get this or is this just, uh, just her?
[134:44.80]This item is basically garlic, but good.
[134:48.20]She's really busted late game.
[134:51.34]Chris is, oh wait, wait, duration.
[134:52.44]We got duration.
[134:58.10]How do we get with this?
[135:02.10]Oh, this is awesome.
[135:02.88]Okay.
[135:06.11]What's the red skeleton?
[135:10.05]White.
[135:10.29]Okay.
[135:10.51]White cartoon glove.
[135:11.25]One again.
[135:17.15]There's the Bible.
[135:19.43]Yep.
[135:22.59]Alright.
[135:22.81]This looks like a win already.
[135:23.79]Just don't be an idiot.
[135:31.51]There it is.
[135:32.33]Alright.
[135:32.77]I got both the birds.
[135:41.78]This character is awesome.
[135:42.80]This is probably the best character in the game.
[135:46.92]Cooldown?
[135:47.44]I think I want Cooldown.
[135:48.54]What does Cooldown scale with?
[135:57.39]Magic Wand?
[135:59.97]Alright, so I should probably get Magic Wand for the last one, right?
[136:02.15]Or is it... No, sorry.
[136:05.27]Is it Rune Tracer?
[136:05.81]I thought it was Magic Wand.
[136:07.47]Magic Wand is bad, but... Eh, it's okay.
[136:12.02]The wand sucks.
[136:12.66]Don't even get it.
[136:17.38]Alright, I definitely want this.
[136:26.91]Do not get Magic Wand.
[136:31.02]Magic Wand eventually turns into a machine gun.
[136:35.48]It's just like... It doesn't stop, right?
[136:40.12]There's Rune Tracer.
[136:42.86]Do I want that as my last slot, though?
[136:48.32]Because I can't... I guess I could, yeah.
[136:52.44]Duration will last a lot longer, yeah.
[136:59.72]This is the character to play here.
[137:01.00]This is... perfect.
[137:17.17]Cooldown... in fact, last... yeah, just level this up.
[137:26.75]I want to get this thing up fast.
[137:33.64]Hell yeah.
[137:35.50]Alright, there's the... I can do the cross now.
[137:41.15]He's going to be invincible?
[137:41.93]Yeah.
[137:43.13]Area is great.
[137:44.49]Do I have enough spaces to do that?
[137:48.77]I might.
[137:58.98]Is the cross worth evolving?
[138:00.16]Isn't the cross really good?
[138:11.60]Hold on.
[138:13.23]I'm not going to upgrade the tomb.
[138:16.59]I'm not going to upgrade the... I feel like I'm spreading myself out and I'm not going to evolve anything.
[138:32.84]You have the Bible upgrade?
[138:33.82]Yeah, I have a Bible.
[138:35.81]I'll take the candle.
[138:36.95]Might as well.
[138:42.63]I almost just died.
[138:43.21]I'm an idiot.
[138:44.97]Alright, I need his chest here.
[139:01.11]He seems tired.
[139:04.47]I'm just chillin', man.
[139:08.45]I'm just chillin'.
[139:12.21]It's late.
[139:12.53]It's like almost midnight.
[139:14.93]Just chillin'.
[139:23.34]Uh, I'll take this.
[139:28.50]Where are the breakable... What are the breakable things here?
[139:32.26]For our food.
[139:32.74]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[139:36.05]I don't know.
[139:36.57]What's going on?
[139:37.09]What's hitting me?
[139:41.29]What just... What was hitting me?
[139:52.41]Against the candles.
[139:53.07]Alright, we're good.
[140:03.26]Trace.
[140:03.66]We're gonna Tracer.
[140:06.50]Base damage.
[140:07.08]Base area, too.
[140:07.94]Alright, now we're talking.
[140:14.14]They respawn.
[140:14.95]Ah, that's what it is.
[140:18.37]Watch out for that evil Pogician.
[140:29.47]cool down and last longer.
[140:31.37]I keep running into them.
[140:36.07]Yeah, I am.
[140:36.87]Why though?
[140:38.27]They just are kind of respawning on top of me.
[140:59.22]Again, base damage up.
[141:01.18]More area.
[141:07.64]What do I need for this?
[141:09.40]For the, um, this thing?
[141:10.88]This upgrade thing?
[141:13.34]Uh, the TD static move?
[141:23.43]I don't have it.
[141:24.09]Oh, shit.
[141:24.53]Okay.
[141:41.93]Oh my god, I just walked into it.
[141:45.69]They do respawn.
[141:46.67]Alright, I gotta stick around and be careful.
[141:52.73]Shit, that sucks.
[141:55.61]That's kind of hard to deal with.
[141:59.01]Because I don't know when it's safe to go over there.
[142:04.73]Just gotta keep moving.
[142:10.35]Because they respawn, but it takes them like a second or two, so.
[142:32.53]Alright.
[142:33.37]Level eight.
[142:34.35]This is the max I can get for this, so.
[142:37.65]It's pretty much on.
[142:38.47]It's on permanently.
[142:46.86]It's cool, but it actually is kind of impeding my vision.
[142:58.51]It's giving me a bad bitrate.
[143:01.51]On my own computer screen.
[143:06.42]Um... I'll do the cross.
[143:16.04]Anything on this map that's like a question mark or anything?
[143:18.04]Oh, there's a chest.
[143:22.92]Although, wait, let me go get this first.
[143:24.94]This is free.
[143:30.12]Oh my goodness.
[143:31.55]There's a gate here.
[143:32.27]I'm locked in.
[143:33.29]I did not know I was going to be locked in.
[143:47.94]uh cross again sensory overload yeah it's gonna get worse
[144:23.17]Just go get the free item and then go back up and get the chest.
[144:41.46]Please get out of the way.
[144:42.20]Get out of the way.
[144:43.53]Get out of the way.
[144:53.70]duplicator but uh I don't want to mess anything up here get the duplicator now I I feel like that's gonna mess it up always get duplicator it's okay hold on it's cross and a bible and cool down right
[145:22.68]Is it going to mess up if I want... I think... Hopefully it doesn't screw up anything.
[145:33.30]Cross, birds, bible, and root tracer.
[145:35.22]Yeah.
[145:44.25]This thing is far away.
[145:45.41]What is that potion?
[145:52.50]There's like a magic potion down here.
[146:00.11]Alright, this is great.
[146:00.95]I can just literally walk down.
[146:02.27]This is perfect.
[146:12.68]Let's take it, right?
[146:13.42]If it's free.
[146:14.42]Level 2.
[146:14.90]Yeah, sure.
[146:15.34]Oh!
[146:19.17]Am I alright?
[146:20.97]Oh my god, what the fuck just happened?
[146:24.24]Dude, what happened?
[146:25.98]What the fuck happened?
[146:31.38]What?
[146:32.88]I went to go... Shit!
[146:40.13]That was a good one too.
[146:41.09]Fuck!
[146:44.49]Oh, that sucks!
[146:47.35]Oh my god, I'm so pissed.
[146:48.79]That sucks.
[146:52.04]See, I told you, right?
[146:53.52]You die in one fucking second.
[146:56.50]They got aggroed after you took the item?
[147:00.34]Shit.
[147:01.94]Shit, this sucks.
[147:02.70]I don't want to ever see this again.
[147:10.29]What happened?
[147:10.97]Dude, what happened?
[147:14.75]Ugh.
[147:23.37]What the fuck happened?
[147:39.37]That was so quick I couldn't even react.
[147:56.54]Yeah.
[147:56.96]Alright.
[147:57.64]Yeah.
[147:57.78]Let's just get these out of the way, right?
[148:05.07]We're good.
[148:05.37]We're good.
[148:05.61]Everything's good.
[148:08.03]Is it a meltdown?
[148:12.81]No meltdowns today.
[148:16.80]This level's kind of hard, too.
[148:23.15]Alright, so I take the item and it spawns a shitload of things.
[148:25.35]I gotta be aware of that.
[148:26.49]And there's the magic potion down here too.
[148:47.15]Kill, please.

[149:11.12]This is the one.

[152:27.23]Alright, this is where I got cocky last time.
[152:28.83]I went, I'm just gonna walk straight down.
[152:30.49]It's gonna be easy.
[152:31.25]Don't do that.

[153:49.80]Guys, what the hell?
[153:53.44]Maybe he's not good at this game.
[153:54.68]I'm fine.
[153:58.06]It's probably Santa water.
[153:59.06]It has to be.
[153:59.60]Alright, let me chill here for a minute.
[154:05.82]Where's the potion?
[154:06.54]Alright, the potion's a little bit further down.
[154:17.35]Don't get whacked.
[154:27.67]Did they respawn more than once or is it just... Okay.
[154:31.28]There we go.
[154:33.82]Is it just one time?
[154:35.28]Is he playing with a mouse?
[154:36.30]No, I don't know.
[154:36.82]I got controller man.
[154:44.64]I'm not confident at all though.
[154:46.98]Zero.
[154:51.16]Look at my items.
[154:51.78]I have seven items right now.
[154:54.23]Almost at seven minutes.
[154:58.80]I'm changing sides.
[154:59.38]Dude, where's all the good shit?
[155:29.89]These guys aren't dropping any experience.
[155:39.04]I gotta chill for a minute.
[155:40.89]I gotta level up.
[155:41.75]No one's dropping enough experience.
[156:01.21]Hold on, something really important is going on behind me.
[156:09.53]One sec.
[156:23.49]He's snoring.
[156:25.94]He's doing that like... He's like dreaming and snoring at the same time.
[156:35.36]Yes, he has two beds.
[156:36.30]He's like Snoopy.
[156:37.86]He doesn't like that one.
[156:44.69]That bed was like $150.
[156:45.99]That bed was like $30.
[156:47.81]It might have even been more than that.
[157:06.39]spoiled always put a mic over there um no that's not gonna work okay uh we'll get it to max alright so what's this potion
[157:55.61]Is it a quest item?
[157:56.27]Alright.
[158:01.60]Be careful, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[158:02.96]Don't be an idiot.
[158:14.65]Alright.
[158:17.41]Rune Tracer level 3.
[158:18.05]Oh, shit.
[158:19.51]Oh, shit.
[158:34.01]Sorceress's Tears permanently allows to speed up time in stage selection.
[158:41.38]Speed up time?
[158:42.04]I don't get it.
[158:43.84]I keep seeing this stupid magic wand.
[158:53.51]I woke up from a dream about Jerma fighting climate change.
[158:59.67]Why am I just infiltrating you guys' dreams so much?
[159:10.83]I need the other bird.
[159:22.83]Saving some water again.
[159:23.75]Alright, okay.
[159:29.10]I got armor for the Rune Tracer.
[159:34.34]He's showing again.
[159:38.96]I don't know what to do here.
[159:54.39]That's a lot of experience.
[160:00.92]Yes.
[160:01.08]Okay, this has got to be close.
[160:09.60]Okay, there's King Bible.
[160:12.19]I don't want to mess myself up here.
[160:13.45]I need King Bible.
[160:17.31]Which will get me... Because that's duration, yeah.
[160:21.49]Oh, the other bird.
[160:22.15]Hold on.
[160:22.69]I need the other bird.
[160:25.91]If I do Bible and the other bird, I should be okay.
[160:36.78]Or should I just forget about the Bible?
[160:49.19]I think it's too good.
[160:55.26]I still have a few slots.
[160:56.28]I have options.
[161:13.88]Alright, well, there's the axe.
[161:14.96]Do I even... Do I get the axe, though?
[161:16.82]I don't know what to do.
[161:19.16]I can't.
[161:30.30]I have to get something up because we're getting to 10 minutes here.
[161:43.39]Yeah, this will be the last run too.
[161:46.37]Whatever happens here is it.
[161:48.89]I better win.
[161:52.69]Here we go.
[161:53.49]I'll take that.
[162:06.40]This projectile is floating around.
[162:07.56]I have to be careful.
[162:08.14]Don't be a stupid idiot.
[162:26.13]I know Duplicator is always an instant grab, but not right now.
[162:30.19]I think I'm alright without it.
[162:50.39]Is there another item up top?
[162:52.11]That's a quest item.
[162:52.81]Moon Tracer.
[163:04.63]There is.
[163:04.93]I mean, it's so far away.
[163:05.87]There's no way I'm getting into this room.
[163:12.44]That's a new enemy.
[163:13.32]I don't know what they do.
[163:28.03]Let's hang out here.
[163:40.54]Damn it.
[163:43.94]Took you 10 minutes to get down.
[163:44.93]You have 18 minutes left.
[163:46.01]That's true.
[163:50.41]That's true.
[163:51.39]And there's a ton of stuff that I... Yeah, let's go back up.
[163:55.57]There's a lot of items and stuff that I didn't get.
[163:57.37]Don't be walking into stuff.
[164:01.52]I'll go for it.
[164:02.06]Let's go back up.
[164:18.83]Bible or wait for, um...
[164:52.77]I kind of feel like the Santa water is not great here because it's just a vertical map.
[164:55.79]And it kind of is going into the bright and left sides.
[164:58.53]There we go.
[165:12.18]Hell yeah.
[165:12.88]Alright, perfect.
[165:17.38]Closer and closer.
[165:18.15]Oh, that's huge.
[165:35.55]Okay, we need wing three.
[165:42.71]Okay, back to back.
[165:47.37]Oh, hell yeah.
[165:48.33]This is it.
[165:50.37]I might even actually get the upgrade right now.
[165:52.79]For one of them.
[165:53.70]Whatever it is, it's close.
[166:06.27]I think that's it for Rune Tracer, right?
[166:12.06]Level four.
[166:12.84]Is that it for Rune Tracer?
[166:17.32]Level six.
[166:17.84]Alright.
[166:18.08]No, I'm almost there.
[166:19.34]Hold on.
[166:21.28]That's five items I don't have to level up.
[166:42.95]I don't even know where the things are, but I'm getting them.
[166:45.74]I know I'm... Duration with this is crazy.
[166:48.12]This is still going?
[166:49.02]Oh my... What?
[167:08.81]Again.
[167:09.03]Again.
[167:12.33]Alright, Rune Tracer is maxed out.
[167:13.53]Let's eat a chest.
[167:34.69]More XP.
[167:41.16]More XP.
[167:49.96]This is raining.
[167:53.59]Camera up.
[167:54.41]Holy shit.
[167:56.93]Yeah, we're still going.
[167:58.01]This is it though.
[167:58.59]We're done after this.
[168:12.99]Oh my God.
[168:17.32]Well, seven.
[168:18.54]Alright, I'm almost there.
[168:19.76]I just need chests.
[168:22.94]Alright, there might be a chest right here.
[168:31.03]Where'd he go?
[168:43.60]Oh my god, there's so much on the screen.
[168:45.45]Alright, Ebony Wing 8.
[168:48.65]I just need a chest.
[168:56.87]I'm just power washing these enemies right now.
[168:59.05]This is ridiculous.
[169:08.80]Holy shit.
[169:19.33]What the fuck does that mean?
[169:20.47]I freaked out and just ran.
[169:34.10]Bible.
[169:34.38]I can't see.
[169:35.06]I don't know what that is.
[169:38.41]What is that thing?
[169:39.13]What's all over me?
[169:40.97]Oh, okay.
[169:41.21]Never mind.
[169:41.49]I'm fine.
[169:44.55]I'm good.
[169:45.21]I'm good.
[169:47.43]We're fine.
[169:51.51]Give me a chest, please.
[169:52.93]Dude.
[169:57.70]I gotta go up.
[170:03.20]Okay.
[170:03.30]Okay.
[170:21.04]Okay.
[170:22.98]Okay.
[170:24.61]Okay.
[170:26.05]Okay.
[170:27.47]Alright.
[170:29.13]Everything's maxed out, I just need chests.
[170:37.01]There's the Bible.
[170:39.49]Evolve King Bible, it never ends.
[170:41.19]I can't even tell what's happening.
[170:58.60]I don't even have everything maxed out yet either.
[171:06.27]Chest would be great.
[171:33.58]Just torrential downpour.
[171:44.11]Here we go.
[171:49.27]What?
[171:57.35]Why did that not evolve?
[172:07.93]That's a chest from the start of the game.
[172:09.91]Oh, it has to spawn after.
[172:11.31]Right.
[172:11.59]Okay.
[172:17.56]I walked by it.
[172:18.16]It's right here.
[172:27.84]Where is it?
[172:35.51]There it is, okay.
[172:37.15]So now I got, uh... Santa... Labora.
[172:41.77]Is now maxed out.
[172:42.98]Back up.
[172:46.32]Now I need the birds and that's it.
[172:49.06]No, Rune Tracer isn't either, is it?
[172:52.54]Yikes.
[173:17.63]I have another 10 minutes.
[173:19.11]I feel like there's a vacuum cleaner on in the room.
[173:42.40]Oh, I'm in an airplane.
[173:49.39]I need a chest right now.
[173:50.69]This one.
[174:06.22]I got this rune tracer.
[174:09.92]This now explodes, right?
[174:11.12]Explodes when bouncing and in retaliation.
[174:12.80]This is going to be ridiculous.
[174:23.85]This might be the most ridiculous display I've ever seen.
[174:31.92]Out of all the time I've played this game, I'm not sure I've seen something like this.
[174:35.46]Just kind of... I just kind of can't even see what's happening.
[174:40.59]Ten... Ten more minutes of this?
[174:51.23]Something's hitting me.
[174:52.69]Oh my god, alright, they respawned.
[174:53.91]Be careful.
[175:05.64]Circular motions.
[175:06.36]Circular motions.
[175:07.82]Circular motions.
[175:10.36]Circular motions.
[175:13.84]We'll get up there eventually.
[175:44.33]Okay, let's go.
[175:46.59]Is there a chest yet?
[175:47.35]I can't even see.
[175:47.95]I don't think so.
[176:00.34]Oh, the colors are blending together.
[176:04.22]Hold on.
[176:06.87]Am I there?
[176:07.27]There's a chest right here.
[176:14.02]This is an AI-generated image.
[176:15.80]Alright, I got the super bird.
[176:18.30]This is where it gets crazy.
[176:21.69]It shoots like the... Yeah.
[176:26.25]AI-generated.
[176:28.15]I got 10 minutes to go walk in a straight line out.
[176:31.27]Everything's maxed out.
[176:34.47]Completely maxed out.
[176:51.53]What is all that?
[176:52.05]All those cards.
[176:57.86]One more weapon?
[176:59.02]Oh my goodness, you're right.
[177:01.06]What should I try to get?
[177:01.70]I forgot when they combine it, you get another one back.
[177:04.40]What should I try to do?
[177:13.27]Pentagram?
[177:17.07]Oh, that's right.
[177:17.89]You can keep leveling this thing up.
[177:19.25]We'll do that for now.
[177:26.65]Pentagram?
[177:31.65]Should I do Pentagram?
[177:32.52]I feel like that's... Doesn't Pentagram suck?
[177:39.02]Didn't I banish the Pentagram?
[177:41.78]At the very beginning?
[177:48.53]I could do the Axe.
[177:50.53]Because I have the Evolve, right?
[177:53.63]Evolve pentagram.
[177:54.45]Do I have the thing that requires the pentagram to evolve?
[177:59.19]What do you need for it?
[178:03.73]I do.
[178:04.07]Alright.
[178:04.41]Now, if it shows up, I'll get it.
[178:06.89]I've never done that before.
[178:12.32]No, no pentagram.
[178:24.26]Oh my god, I can't see.
[178:25.26]I need help.
[178:33.96]GUYS!
[178:48.43]HEY!
[178:49.77]What's happening?
[178:56.26]I'M FUCKING DEAD!
[178:57.20]Huh?
[179:08.33]What was going on?
[179:09.37]I couldn't even see what was happening!
[179:16.65]I have to dodge the mortars?
[179:18.07]I-I... What?
[179:25.33]Could I could see the exclamation point, but I didn't I don't know where the circle is Do my screen is like it's I can't fucking see anything what the fuck Wings are necessary on this map because what the hell was that I?
[179:55.51]Oh my god.
[179:56.59]I was trying to do- I could see the exclamation points and I'm assuming that there's like a circle around it.
[180:02.62]And I'm trying to just move around and get the fuck out of the way.
[180:16.01]God damn it, that was such a great run too.
[180:17.89]Oh, that sucks.
[180:25.85]Oh, come on, really?
[180:26.93]I didn't expect them to be that many.
[180:30.07]It just kept happening.
[180:31.99]I didn't know where to go.
[180:32.75]Alright, that's it.
[180:39.19]Oh, that sucked.
[180:39.89]What a shitty one to go out on.
[180:44.37]I even had the movement speed.
[181:06.45]Shit.
[181:08.23]Alright, one more.
[181:09.71]One more.
[181:10.05]Now I know that happens.
[181:11.15]Maybe I should... Oh, what do I do here?
[181:16.66]This is actually the last one.
[181:17.94]For real.
[181:18.50]There's no way I'm doing another one.
[181:20.92]For real, the last one.
[181:25.72]Who do I play with?
[181:33.69]Should I do the same character?
[181:34.53]I feel like it's... I don't know.
[181:41.03]Let's do Porta.
[181:44.15]What does hurry mode mean?
[181:48.96]Alright, we're going up.
[181:53.56]It's all about the area.
[181:54.56]It's all about Lightning Ring.
[181:59.28]Yeah, see?
[181:59.72]It's like, it's hard to tell.
[182:07.12]Santa water.
[182:09.74]We're doing all area.
[182:11.26]Area, area, area.
[182:12.18]And I'm going up.
[182:19.03]I'm so salty with that one.
[182:22.23]Well, now I know what they do.
[182:23.17]It's like they go, whoop, and they land.
[182:25.99]So the exclamation point happens.
[182:28.03]And then it's like two, it's like a full two seconds later.
[182:30.17]It's like, one, two, and it shows up.
[182:33.90]See that?
[182:34.16]I couldn't tell.
[182:34.58]Yeah, you couldn't see anything.
[182:40.48]And I'm taking Laurel.
[182:41.94]And I know that's like a, you know, wow, this streamer is actually going to take Laurel.
[182:45.94]I want it and I need it.
[182:47.04]I feel like it's a huge thing to have here.
[182:48.40]I feel like it's very important.
[182:52.58]Especially when you don't know what you're getting hit by.
[182:56.08]I'm taking it.
[183:02.79]Duration or let's just rush these up as fast as I can.
[183:18.78]Look, we're already at one minute.
[183:21.20]Laurel has helped a ton.
[183:22.28]Yeah.
[183:24.18]It really does.
[183:24.62]Especially when it gets leveled up, because then you can take three, four, five hits in a row.
[183:30.47]It's really, really helpful.
[183:39.58]I'm not concerned about damage here.
[183:52.19]I have lots of concentrated damage, so I think I'll be fine.
[183:56.33]That one was so cool, though.
[184:14.13]Okay.
[184:17.94]Maybe should I take that?
[184:31.50]Hey!
[184:31.88]Stop walking in circles!
[184:33.16]It can't be- I- Wha- Where do I get the thing that upgrades it?
[184:47.18]More.
[185:06.06]More.
[185:07.78]Again.
[185:41.85]Kylo Ren.
[185:42.77]More!
[185:48.90]More.
[185:50.48]I don't know why I just thought of the Voldemort Homer Simpson thing again.
[185:58.19]That's been killing me.
[185:58.97]I don't know why I've been thinking of it recently.
[186:05.83]Legendary chest right here.
[186:19.17]Stick around.
[186:19.87]I'm not going anywhere until I get a chest from this guy.
[186:28.49]Yeah.
[186:28.89]Yeah.
[186:32.81]Bible.
[186:33.13]Because this is area, right?
[186:36.11]The Bibles are huge, aren't they?
[186:44.15]Yeah.
[186:45.79]Hey, you good?
[186:46.25]Yeah.
[186:47.27]You?
[186:48.57]You good?
[186:54.13]Legendary.
[186:54.45]Fuck you.
[187:01.96]Get the axe for area passive.
[187:07.36]That's probably a good play.
[187:22.91]Oh, spellbinder.
[187:44.44]Do I use a voice changer?
[187:45.56]When I press the button, yeah.
[187:50.92]Little bit of speed.
[187:53.00]Little bit of speed.
[187:59.13]That might be the greatest thing to come out of that stream.
[188:03.19]Those guys were so funny.
[188:04.87]They really were.
[188:05.47]That was such a great group.
[188:09.63]That was such a great group of guys.
[188:29.12]Yep.
[188:29.62]Yep.
[188:30.32]Yep.
[188:58.20]Can I get a look at people?
[189:01.82]Okay, if I don't do it this time, then when the hell am I ever going to do it?
[189:08.35]That just saves so much time.
[189:12.87]Very nice.
[189:15.75]Everything I have.
[189:16.33]That's actually good to get early because it just makes half your shit just go up higher.
[189:23.24]Yep.
[189:24.84]Alright, alright.
[189:25.36]No, let me heal.
[189:26.42]I'm getting a little excited.
[189:34.74]Let the laurel sulfate, whatever it is, build up.
[189:54.18]Alright, lightning is maxed.
[189:59.10]And then I just need to get the thing and I'll be good to go.
[190:06.69]Get out of here.
[190:12.30]Yeah, give me that.
[190:18.00]Thank you.
[190:20.16]Yup.
[190:20.36]Alright, we're good.
[190:28.83]Yup.
[190:39.01]I feel a little more confident on this one.
[190:45.91]Mainly because of the Laurel.
[190:47.05]I'm just stuttering.
[191:01.81]This on the switch would be crazy.
[191:07.08]That would kind of be hard on the Switch, don't you think?
[191:10.15]That small screen.
[191:10.87]It'd be hard to see what's going on.
[191:20.97]Be cool.
[191:21.37]Alright, I gotta get down here and get all these crunchies.
[191:34.42]Alright, hold on.
[191:37.84]I need... I have the orb.
[191:39.00]I think I take the... I think I take the tiramisu.
[191:50.36]I'm not confident.
[191:52.14]Now let's get the candle.
[192:20.66]How close am I to... Alright, I'm almost... Look at all these cards and stuff.
[192:23.70]What's that?
[192:24.06]Whatever that is, I'm almost there.
[192:37.19]Laurel.
[192:44.48]Oh my god.
[192:45.28]This is not the run then.
[192:46.16]I don't know when the hell it's going to happen.
[192:47.92]They're just giving it to me at this point.
[192:51.77]They're just giving it to me.
[193:00.03]Oh yeah.
[193:01.67]Perfect.
[193:06.51]Beautiful.
[193:06.77]Uh oh.
[193:17.13]um am I in trouble here if I don't banish one of these I need three slots don't I or should I just take the crown I think I need three slots
[193:47.74]I think I need the slots.
[193:49.86]Otherwise I won't be able to upgrade something.
[193:56.03]I think that's the right call.
[194:15.41]Alright, so I don't want to touch this, do I?
[194:17.17]Because this is going to give it to me.
[194:18.27]Shouldn't I not touch this?
[194:22.39]The bracer that's up here?
[194:27.15]Yeah, don't touch it yet.
[194:45.92]Alright, Bible's up all the way.
[195:00.91]Area.
[195:10.46]Be careful because it's going to spawn a bunch of shit at me, isn't it?
[195:22.73]Be careful, yep.
[195:30.28]Okay, they're out of the way there.
[195:39.87]Haven't seen that in a while.
[196:05.47]What do I want for my la- What should I get for my last item?
[196:16.36]Axe, right?
[196:19.52]Yeah, axe.
[196:26.32]Okay, here we go.
[196:27.48]First, evolve.
[196:29.64]Bible.
[196:41.69]I need more projectiles.
[196:45.11]Maybe I don't.
[196:46.83]Damage is not a problem right now.
[196:47.95]It really isn't.
[196:48.41]Take a look at what just spawned over there.
[197:13.01]Just walk in a circle and collect.
[197:14.19]Alright, here we go.
[197:30.31]We're almost at the... I don't want to pick this up.
[197:36.61]Should I get this now?
[197:37.35]Because everyone was saying this is insane.
[197:40.24]Get the pentagram, pentagram, pentagram!
[197:43.32]Or not yet.
[198:00.69]Late game.
[198:01.15]Alright, I'm not touching that.
[198:11.30]Shit.
[198:11.55]It's okay.
[198:12.29]Laurel for the win.
[198:17.83]Damage is falling off.
[198:18.71]I gotta get some more stuff.
[198:26.82]Alright, that's fine.
[198:52.91]Alright, good opportunity for a chest.
[199:02.40]I'm just collecting, that's it.
[199:03.34]Don't worry, I'm going back up.
[199:14.87]Awesome.
[199:21.35]Okay, so I need to level up, like, one more time, right?
[199:24.23]I'm gonna stick around here for a second.
[199:29.78]When did the scientists let you out of the lab?
[199:31.32]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[199:36.36]Um, well, it was a hospital.
[199:38.64]And it was when I was an infant.
[199:40.38]I was born, and then my mother and father took me home.
[199:44.75]So, I don't know.
[199:47.51]That was about when I was, I don't know, a day old?
[199:51.79]How long are you in the hospital for when you're a baby?
[199:55.05]Uh, I don't want any of these, so I'm gonna have to just do this.
[200:00.21]That's not, that's not Axe.
[200:06.56]Oh, this is a disaster.
[200:22.70]If I do armor, I can get the Rune Tracer, yeah?
[200:28.06]Yeah, and then I have... Okay, well, Rune Tracer it is.
[200:31.00]Or Clover, but I can't evolve anything with Clover, can I?
[200:35.54]Or is Clover Axe?
[200:38.95]Evolved Garlic Heals.
[200:42.75]Clover and Cross, okay.
[200:43.77]Okay.
[200:46.47]What would be better?
[200:47.05]Probably garlic then.
[200:47.87]I don't know.
[200:49.65]Garlic I feel like would be great because it will heal and it's like a huge area.
[200:54.98]Oh, I banished the item for garlic.
[200:56.28]I can't do it.
[200:57.40]Yeah, I'm doing Rune Tracer.
[201:02.12]I banished it.
[201:03.04]Yeah, I'll do Rune Tracer, I think.
[201:04.11]I have to just do armor.
[201:14.89]I can't...
[201:17.81]This axe.
[201:18.77]Fuck.
[201:22.90]Do I want Ruin Tracer or axe?
[201:24.38]What's better for right now?
[201:30.42]I feel like it's axe because it's up and down.
[201:32.74]Yeah, let's do axe.
[201:46.85]Keep going.
[201:49.30]Let me just chill here for a second.
[201:52.16]Because there's a chest right there.
[201:53.48]Do I have anything maxed out?
[201:54.40]Okay, I can do... I can get the chest.
[202:05.58]There's the lightning one.
[202:08.47]So this would be really good here.
[202:10.21]It's going to just strike all over the place in this tiny little area.
[202:17.39]Take the orb again.
[202:32.37]I gotta keep leveling up.
[202:35.59]Axe again.
[202:41.61]I gotta, I gotta rush.
[202:45.79]Get the tome, I will.
[202:48.84]Maybe if you're good.
[203:04.51]Great.
[203:06.23]I think I'm alright though.
[203:29.81]chest down here I think is there I can't even tell is there a chest down here yeah there is
[203:58.74]So I can pick this up because I think one's ready to go.
[204:05.52]Seven.
[204:10.30]Yeah, yep, yep.
[204:10.94]Okay, there's that Max Labora.
[204:19.72]Now let's go up and get the other one.
[204:24.16]Bingo.
[204:24.56]Alright, let's go.
[204:26.36]Now just don't get hit by this shit.
[204:30.21]And get the Bracer too.
[204:31.81]Oh my!
[204:35.35]Where's the Bracer?
[204:35.99]It's up.
[204:47.88]What's happening?
[204:55.75]Bracer, I can get it.
[205:05.25]I actually probably should start stacking armor.
[205:18.88]Here's the axe.
[205:20.78]Okay, let's go.
[205:21.62]Yeah, I need armor.
[205:28.31]I don't know if I can hit by a few of those, I'm done.
[205:47.40]I went by the bracer.
[205:50.70]I can't see anything.
[205:59.09]What's it right there?
[205:59.59]Alright, I got it.
[206:05.86]The other one's way too far down.
[206:06.94]Let's go back up.
[206:14.87]Use this.
[206:15.23]Alright.
[206:17.27]This is the one.
[206:18.41]I'm not going to fuck it up.
[206:19.15]There's another item right here.
[206:22.51]Okay.
[206:38.58]Go.
[206:39.06]Don't fuck it up.
[206:41.02]Smart.
[206:43.51]Smart plays.
[207:36.59]These shrimps just get in.
[207:39.10]I need my laurel to charge back up.
[207:40.70]These shrimps keep getting in.
[208:02.63]Look at the shrimps just keep getting in.
[208:12.53]How am I gonna last another 10 plus minutes?
[208:17.43]My god.
[208:18.07]Dude, don't do that.
[208:29.22]These guys are freezing me.
[208:36.86]Dude, these guys are freezing me!
[208:39.69]What is that thing?
[208:42.69]Random Mazo.
[208:43.97]Enables the unlocking and activation of Arcanas?
[208:51.67]What happened?
[208:52.84]Healing is doubled.
[208:53.64]Recovering HP damages nearby enemies for the same amount?
[209:00.88]Healing is doubled.
[209:02.74]Recovering HP damages nearby... I don't have any of that.
[209:06.38]I guess I'm... I get it?
[209:07.69]Get?
[209:07.87]I don't think I'm healing.
[209:11.79]That's kind of cool, though.
[209:16.35]I'm moving so slow.
[209:17.63]I'm going to get blown up.
[209:23.08]I got to kill those things.
[209:24.40]This is bad.
[209:24.88]I got to kill them.
[209:26.76]Otherwise, I'm going to get blown up.
[209:43.49]Okay, I think they're gone.
[209:48.90]Alright, this is it.
[209:49.86]This is when a huge problem happens.
[209:52.31]Ride it like 20 minutes.
[209:53.25]Is there anything else on the map?
[210:03.33]No.
[210:05.92]Happens soon.
[210:06.52]Alright, get ready.
[210:24.34]Just walking in a straight line should fix it.
[210:32.39]Dude, these fucking things just respawn.
[210:34.09]I gotta stand still for a minute.
[211:17.97]I'm gonna hang out here.
[211:23.27]Just move back and forth.
[211:26.95]I think I'm gonna be fine.
[211:31.86]Why do I feel so slow?
[211:36.54]I feel so slow.
[212:17.73]I gotta act like Duck Hunt.
[212:19.71]Just move in a pattern.
[212:22.51]Don't stop moving.
[212:23.67]This is where I died before.
[212:30.01]Don't stop moving.
[212:30.65]It's not here yet.
[212:41.95]I walked into that before.
[212:42.97]Remember that?
[212:49.19]Where is it?
[213:09.58]Who cares about the chests?
[213:13.76]It pauses me and gets me out.
[213:55.17]I'm slow as shit right now.
[214:38.61]Oh, fuck.
[214:45.69]There's health up there though.
[214:46.67]That's good.
[215:12.15]I'll take it.
[215:16.07]You get a chicken every time you level up, potentially?
[215:17.73]That's true, but I have to level up to get it.
[215:20.15]So if I'm almost dead... I know where one is.
[215:28.20]Right down here, right?
[215:47.04]Five minutes.
[215:48.94]I got it.
[216:08.99]What the fuck is that?
[216:10.45]What is going on with that thing?
[216:11.51]Why is it growing in size?
[216:14.87]Okay, that was terrifying.
[216:17.16]I think the more you hit them, they grow.
[216:20.67]What's going on?
[216:23.59]What's that all about?
[216:27.47]Why was the bottom of the screen just blinking red?
[216:29.81]Do I just have to run?
[217:49.42]Kill the crab?
[217:50.04]I think I did.
[217:52.20]It's a little past your bedtime?
[217:59.98]I'll be alright.
[218:02.70]Why move if I don't need to?
[218:15.82]Just money.
[218:17.28]Alright, this shit coming from all of the... Okay, be careful.
[218:23.58]Three minutes, let's go.
[218:34.41]This fucking lion is in the way!
[218:46.32]Yeah.
[221:26.50]That's it.
[221:45.65]30.
[221:48.38]Nice.
[221:50.62]Hyper gallo tower.
[221:54.99]Uh, the Arcanas.
[221:58.69]Sarabandi of Healing.
[222:01.08]And... I didn't have... I had Vanish before, didn't I?
[222:06.42]Dude, look at that Thunder Loop.
[222:08.20]2.9 million damage.
[222:12.38]So much.
[222:12.86]That's why Lightning is just so much... It's so amazing in this game.
[222:22.32]So what am I missing?
[222:24.64]Survive 15 minutes with Giovanna.
[222:26.70]Gets you a little pig.
[222:30.85]Are those guns?
[222:31.65]Survive 10 minutes with Pugnala?
[222:33.91]20 minutes with at least a 10% curse.
[222:37.93]I haven't done that.
[222:38.57]I tried.
[222:44.24]Pentagram level 7.
[222:45.60]Unlocks Christine.
[222:52.71]Interesting.
[222:53.83]There's a ton of characters.
[222:56.57]All I can do, banish more than once.
[222:57.79]I get it.
[223:06.37]Level 99.
[223:10.61]It's you.
[223:11.35]Heart of Fire.
[223:12.15]What is that?
[223:12.51]I wonder what that is.
[223:17.56]Evolve and unite Farrier de Tufelo and Ate the Sparrow.
[223:25.56]Cool.
[223:26.34]Alright, really cool.
[223:32.64]Yeah, this game's amazing.
[223:33.40]You'll probably see it again.
[223:34.92]Maybe we'll do it again on these kind of chill zones where we just kind of hang out and play.
[223:42.11]Just kind of hang out at the end of the night, maybe.
[223:45.23]Okay, so here's a plan.
[223:46.27]Let's give you the plan.
[223:50.85]I'm not going to stream on Sunday, which is technically right now.
[223:56.66]So I'll see you guys on, not Monday, maybe, what, hmm.
[224:02.74]I got something going on on Monday.
[224:06.04]I forget what it is.
[224:15.40]Keep an eye on the sus.
[224:17.34]Because I might stream on Monday, but I think something's going on.
[224:20.28]I have something to do on Monday.
[224:21.12]I don't know what it is.
[224:24.21]Monday or Tuesday is where the next stream will be.
[224:25.73]I'll see you then.
[224:27.07]My voice, man.
[224:27.75]I really wish I knew it was wrong.
[224:28.97]I have to go back to the doctor and be like, dude, what's going on with me?
[224:33.61]I mean, I have been talking for eight and a half hours, right?
[224:35.23]But I feel like it's kind of been bad the last week or two.
[224:38.69]It's been really weird.
[224:41.75]That was a fun one.
[224:42.41]That was like four games.
[224:46.23]That's kind of crazy.
[224:48.95]Fix the mic too.
[224:49.86]Has it been eight and a half hours of a terrible microphone?
[225:00.83]Yeah, I'll see you Monday or Tuesday.
[225:05.15]Keep an eye on the sus.
[225:06.86]And let's go ahead and say goodbye.
[225:14.62]Thanks to Atriok again for the raid.
[225:17.10]Not sure if any of you guys are still here.
[225:18.98]If you are, then cool.
[225:20.82]Thanks for staying up, everybody.
[225:24.99]Thanks for all the subs, all the bits and everything.
[225:26.61]Appreciate it.
[225:34.08]Have a great rest of your night.
[225:35.00]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[225:38.34]What is left of it, right?
[225:39.28]Because today is Sunday.
[225:48.11]Bye, Jerma.
[225:48.53]Sorry, I said you're bad at this game.
[225:51.05]That's all good.
[225:51.57]Don't worry.
[225:56.35]I mean, I did die to a very easy thing, didn't I?
[226:05.12]Risk of Rain 2.
[226:07.96]I played Risk of Rain 2 when it was in the first week of early access and then didn't touch it for two years.
[226:14.73]Is it better?
