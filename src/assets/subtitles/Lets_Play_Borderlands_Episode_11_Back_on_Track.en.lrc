[05:54.46]It's an insta kill if I run them over.
[05:56.41]Yeah, this thing isn't doing too much damage.
[06:00.65]Oh, I pinned that guy.
[06:02.33]Like point blank rocket the face.
[06:04.01]It takes like three shots to kill somebody.
[06:06.21]Oh, watch out for our health, for our shields.
[06:08.07]Let them regain, don't shoot right next to us.
[06:09.87]Here, I got him, I got him, I got him.

[08:40.18]Alright, I think we need to climb up to that top thing.
[08:48.81]Yeah, it looks like it's right here.
[08:50.79]There must be some hidden stuff in here though, so... Oh, whoops, I think we gotta go inside.
[08:55.95]Yeah, we'll check around first.
[08:57.74]Yeah, there's a weapon chest up here.
[09:00.50]Nice.
[09:02.92]Oh, nice.
[09:03.34]Oh, there's an electric repeater.
[09:08.84]None of them are better than mine.
[09:11.62]Wait.
[09:15.72]Jesus Christ, 28 damage.
[09:19.14]Are you still trying to get up here?
[09:21.10]No.
[09:22.95]No, I wasn't still trying to get up the stairs.
[09:26.99]Not at all.
[09:29.19]Highly effective versus shields.
[09:33.68]Uh... Here, drop down.
[09:36.72]Oh, I got an awesome shield down here.
[09:41.25]And we got a bunch of cash.
[09:43.75]Oh, where's the key?
[09:45.73]Here's the key.
[09:46.57]There we go, I grabbed it.
[09:52.83]Cool.
[09:53.27]So electricity can remove shields on chance, I guess.
[09:56.58]I think we gotta go... Did you go in the building?

[10:16.23]Oh, I don't think so.
[10:16.89]Let's see.
[10:17.39]Here's the open door.

[12:02.72]Don't worry.
[12:04.52]Yeah, I'll be late to the party.
[12:07.79]Hey, better late than never, right?
[12:08.95]All we have to do is turn it in now, so I'm gonna go back to the Arid Badlands thing.
