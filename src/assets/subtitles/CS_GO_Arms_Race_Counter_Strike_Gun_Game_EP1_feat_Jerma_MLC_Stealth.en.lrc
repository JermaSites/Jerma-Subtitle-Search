[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.69]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:09.51]Arsenal.
[00:09.79]Man, I got the jump on that guy.
[00:11.33]So just like, what's going on guys?
[00:13.89]We got Jerma Grandpa and MCL Stealth playing some Arsenal.
[00:18.66]I'm legitimately live commentating this swagger battle.
[00:26.02]Swagger battle.
[00:27.75]I like how your warning of this is the intro, like your intro.
[00:31.87]That's because I just started recording.
[00:34.55]Don't be mad.
[00:36.05]I'm happy.
[00:37.17]Oh, watch it, watch it.
[00:39.67]Are we on?
[00:40.04]Yeah, we're on the same team, right?
[00:41.38]Yeah, we're all losing on the same team.
[00:46.78]Let me get that shotgun I had before.
[00:48.42]That thing was sick.
[00:50.60]I'm shooting at him.
[00:52.30]Oh, he just killed me.
[00:54.65]Should be team killing like a boss over there.
[00:58.61]It all looks the same.
[01:01.15]It all looks the same.
[01:03.41]What?
[01:04.11]Oh, he's behind me.
[01:04.63]You see, we look like good guys.
[01:06.13]They look like counter-terrorists.
[01:07.53]That's racist.
[01:11.93]No, that's morally ambiguous.
[01:14.11]Wow.
[01:14.67]Pulling off the big words here.
[01:15.61]Bot Sean.
[01:18.06]Damn, this bot.
[01:18.80]I keep dying from the same bot.
[01:21.76]I got an MP7.
[01:22.14]I can go hammer.
[01:30.00]Bot Sean can suck a dick.
[01:33.89]I was doing so well, too.
[01:35.27]Yeah, Bot Sean absolutely can suck a big, juicy, ugly, fat... Fatty.
[01:40.95]Ah, sausage.
[01:43.59]I got killed by Pinkie Pie.
[01:45.03]I think his brother's Pinkie Pie.
[01:47.62]Somebody has an auto-shotty and they are just wrecking me.
[01:49.92]Oh my god, I just got AWPed.
[01:51.96]Wow.
[01:53.74]Oof.
[01:55.28]This game is so difficult.
[01:56.48]I don't understand the recoil at all.
[01:58.10]I know.
[01:59.72]I'm horrible.
[02:02.00]I... oh, lag.
[02:02.48]Oh, oh.
[02:02.66]So that's a little bit of lag right there.
[02:04.46]I just don't understand the recoil.
[02:06.33]Alright, give me that auto-shotty.
[02:12.03]There it is.
[02:14.43]Oh, I... oh, I get plastered.
[02:18.59]Yeah, the recoil is tough to get used to.
[02:20.29]Oh my god, I just got knifed.
[02:24.77]Yeah, I'm using this like... this shotgun looks like a mini Uzi.
[02:35.98]Where'd this guy go?
[02:40.14]Come on.
[02:40.58]Seriously, the guys we're facing are so much better than us.
[02:45.04]I was about to turn around and stop team killing.
[02:48.21]Been there, done that.
[02:53.63]Why'd the guy I was shooting take so many shots to kill?
[02:58.52]You don't get that headshot, it's just like meat shield.
[03:02.90]Ah, it's like facing like a heavy on... Oh my god, there's a guy in our spawn just raping my ass.
[03:09.79]I see that guy.
[03:10.79]God.
[03:14.94]So I gotta stop going under.
[03:16.82]Going above is a death wish.
[03:20.19]There you go.
[03:20.45]Somebody just across the map is gonna punch one through your skull.
[03:26.21]Ah.
[03:27.49]Yes, he is.
[03:28.79]Yikes.
[03:31.39]Why yikes, Shaggy?
[03:32.55]Oh god, Nova shotgun.
[03:33.67]Dropping stuff.
[03:34.43]Dropping stuff.
[03:36.81]I'm finally out of the, like, shotgun stage.
[03:38.53]Whoa, legs.
[03:39.95]What happened?
[03:40.59]Oh.
[03:41.27]They won.
[03:41.99]Yeah, they won.
[03:43.45]Faggot hackers.
[03:46.15]Look at those kill to death ratios and look at ours.
[03:48.35]They're all positive.
[03:49.47]Except for Bot Sean.
[03:52.71]Bot Sean is a fucking boss.
[03:54.82]Don't even hate.
[03:57.02]Just cause he has some extra baggage.
[04:00.40]Go CT again.
[04:03.88]We have to win a game.
[04:05.74]If we don't win one game, I'm gonna cry.
