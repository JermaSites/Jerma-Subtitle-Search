[00:54.89]Better late than never.
[00:57.05]You know what I mean?
[01:00.04]Rare stream for one day only.
[01:01.46]That's right, for just one day only.
[01:05.24]We have a little crew here.
[01:06.32]I don't think everyone's ready.
[01:09.04]I think a couple of us have said we're just going to chill for a minute.
[01:12.96]The players today are going to be... Me.
[01:23.87]Ster.
[01:28.13]Binny.

[01:36.29]Ster.
[01:37.95]Vinny.
[01:39.95]Poke.
[01:43.53]Can I put that in the title?
[01:45.53]Yeah.
[01:46.53]Yeah, I would just say We're the Valiant.
[01:50.49]With the boys.
[01:54.60]It's always gonna be the boys, doesn't it?
[01:57.00]Oh, with the boys.
[01:57.74]You know, just hanging out with the boys.
[02:01.57]We need to have a team name.
[02:13.30]A splats?
[02:15.98]I don't think we should be called the splats.
[02:17.36]Okay.
[02:27.98]How about the... Okay, hold on.
[02:30.35]How about the... You just put an emo.
[02:32.37]How about the Jerma Olds?
[02:36.29]No, I don't want my name in the title.
[02:40.13]That's the worst fucking thing ever.
[02:41.19]You know how many emails I have to answer if my name's in the title?
[02:47.83]Ah, Jerma and the Go-Getters.
[02:49.44]No, no, no.
[02:49.80]I have to answer all the fucking emails if that's the case.
[02:52.16]Nope.
[02:52.32]I don't want to do that.
[02:55.13]You know how many events I'd have to go to?
[02:56.35]How many things I'd have to do?
[02:57.92]How many people I'd have to call every day?
[03:01.08]No.
[03:14.28]I... I do not want anyone to be called the sus guys.
[03:20.28]Absolutely not.
[03:31.49]The Elder Council.
[03:32.73]Alright, these are all, these are all bangers.
[03:39.23]Yeah, we're playing EDF 6.
[03:40.47]It came out a little while ago.
[03:41.93]If you don't know what EDF is, well, we can explain it to you.
[03:46.32]We're just going to play.
[03:47.04]We're going to hang out.
[03:47.72]It's going to be a gamer sesh.
[03:49.42]I'm just chilling.
[03:50.12]It's going to be a good day.
[03:52.30]It's going to be a good night.
[03:55.28]Earth Defense 4-6.
[03:58.72]Let's answer all the questions we can about this game.
[04:01.10]For all of you that don't know what's going on and don't know what this game is, first of all, come on.
[04:08.35]If you don't know what EDF is, can you even call yourself a PC gamer?
[04:16.80]Actually, yes, because I don't think the ports are ever good.
[04:19.40]So, yes, you can.
[04:24.92]God, no.
[04:25.48]No.
[04:32.82]Eating dirt for fun.
[04:35.14]Don't do that.
[04:40.31]Yeah, it's a game where I and I hate to say this.
[04:45.17]I hate to say what I'm about to say right now, but this is a war against bugs.
[04:50.17]Alien invasion.
[04:51.03]It's an alien invasion.
[04:52.45]Aliens come to Earth and you have to attack bugs because they drop a bunch of bugs and bugs are aliens and they come to kill to get us.
[04:59.89]So this is a bug killing game.
[05:10.13]The Earth Defense Force.
[05:11.42]Alright, what how we doing here?
[05:15.84]We we we chillin we good.

[06:59.07]Hey, how you doing, Jerma?
[07:00.83]This is my birthday.
[07:02.25]Don't do that.
[07:03.47]Just had pizza.
[07:04.29]You don't want me to get up and, well, you don't want me to do the master of ceremonies where I get up and introduce your birthday?
[07:08.97]I want you to clank on the wine glass and get everyone's attention and give a long, earnest, heartfelt speech about how I've changed your life.
[07:20.96]Anybody here?
[07:21.70]Anybody got a speech to give about somebody special?
[07:25.39]Okay, hold on a second here.
[07:27.47]You just have like a whole bunch of trash next to your computer.
[07:31.93]That is one of seven plates.
[07:37.58]No, I clean my shit up, alright?
[07:39.32]I clean my room.
[07:41.38]You never know when you need those plates.
[07:44.06]He's got the one glass.
[07:45.62]He's got like three.
[07:46.72]His face is all like red, like dripping from his lip.
[07:50.60]I'm telling you, there's absolutely not a ceramic plate on the desk that has old dried ketchup on it.
[08:01.21]And it's smeared around in a circle, like a big circle around the plate.
[08:05.02]And like, what are you like?
[08:06.56]I don't have one of those right now.
[08:07.82]You can't leave ketchup on the plate.
[08:10.83]Yeah, it's crazy.
[08:11.37]You put that in the sink.
[08:12.49]Yeah, that's just stinks up.
[08:13.81]And then it turns into like, brick.
[08:17.55]Like you could make a house.
[08:19.55]Everybody just thinks this is real.
[08:20.67]Like guys, I don't I that was a drink.
[08:22.71]95% of everything I ever say is not real.
[08:26.73]Like that we talked about this before.
[08:28.33]So why are you adding to this?
[08:30.05]You made me do that.
[08:32.32]Well, I expected a speech.
[08:33.76]I don't think you're in the game, Poke.
[08:36.32]I'm here.
[08:37.38]Well, it doesn't show you in the Epic Games as online, so I can't invite you.
[08:42.06]Oh.
[08:43.54]I wanted to give a speech while you're doing that.
[08:47.02]I met, uh, Ster.
[08:48.20]Oh, settle down, everybody.
[08:49.80]I met Ster at a, uh, bar.
[08:53.02]And, uh, funny story.
[08:55.86]We actually got in a little fight at the bar.
[08:58.34]I ordered a drink.
[09:00.24]He thought it was his drink when the bartender gave it.
[09:03.11]And we kind of got in a little back and forth.
[09:05.91]And then I threw my drink in his face.
[09:07.33]He threw his drink in my face.
[09:09.45]And then I, like, I beat the fuck out of him.
[09:11.35]Like, big time.
[09:12.79]Yeah, but he took me home that night.
[09:15.03]And then he...
[09:18.50]Is this me giving a speech at our wedding?
[09:24.15]Yeah.
[09:25.49]This is how we met.
[09:26.43]I don't know, Ster.
[09:30.01]I feel like you've changed since I've known you.
[09:32.78]Have I?
[09:34.82]Vinny, give us a speech.
[09:35.46]Just drastically.
[09:37.08]I don't know.
[09:37.42]I feel like, you know, Ster, on this day, your birthday, I've known you since that bar, too, and I watched the fight in Instigated, and you just haven't been the same.
[09:45.99]You haven't had the same left hook.
[09:48.32]You know, you can't kick as high as you used to.
[09:51.38]My left arm, my elbow is really messed up.
[09:53.89]I'm wearing, like, a compression sleeve on it.
[09:56.59]It hurts bad.
[09:57.71]I can't punch him the way I did that night.
[10:00.81]I hate to ruin the wedding, but, like, I don't know how to join.
[10:05.23]Is the game open?
[10:06.39]Are you in the online, like, lobby area?
[10:08.55]Yeah, I'm in the title screen.
[10:11.86]Did you give me the correct...
[10:14.72]Do I have some random dude on my friends list?
[10:16.65]Because it just says you're online.
[10:18.03]It doesn't say you're in a game.
[10:20.47]Online mission mode.
[10:22.71]Wait, I don't want to open it through Epic, right?
[10:25.95]No.
[10:26.19]Oh, here we go.
[10:26.47]I got it.
[10:26.83]I got it.
[10:27.15]I got it.
[10:27.51]I had to click Epic.
[10:29.06]I had to click online, I think.
[10:30.86]I'm now here.
[10:32.14]Yeah, I think it's going to log you in.
[10:33.50]My chat was saying Epic will be optional soon.
[10:37.10]Here we go.
[10:37.38]Accept.
[10:37.54]Accept.
[10:39.47]boom that's some goofy shit isn't it that's like pulling into a McDonald's drive-thru and it's like all fake posters and it's a Burger King yeah you need the Burger King app hey speaking of how did the jury find the hamburger
[10:58.95]Grilty as charged.
[11:00.91]Sorry, Grilty as charred.
[11:03.01]That makes it wet.
[11:05.22]That actually, I like that a lot.
[11:07.18]It was good, but I don't know.
[11:08.70]The correction upset me.
[11:11.06]I think the correction made it better.
[11:12.80]On this, the day of my birthday.
[11:21.21]I beefed it.
[11:21.97]Oh, no.
[11:22.27]How have the boys been doing?
[11:23.83]It's been a while since we've talked.
[11:25.85]Yeah, since that bar fight.
[11:29.36]Did we Hell Dive together?
[11:30.52]Was that the last one?
[11:31.74]That was the last time.
[11:33.06]Why are we playing the worst Hell Divers?
[11:36.02]Better, better, better, better.
[11:37.98]Poke just threw a drink in my face.
[11:39.37]At the bar.
[11:39.79]Poke just threw a drink in my face.
[11:40.67]Yeah, I don't care.
[11:41.63]What are we doing here?
[11:42.27]What is this game?
[11:42.89]What the fuck?
[11:44.60]This game's $60.
[11:44.94]ZDF.
[11:45.38]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[11:48.46]It is $60.
[11:49.90]Was it $60?
[11:51.45]Yeah.
[11:52.79]Oh.
[11:53.19]I mean... I love this game, though.
[11:54.77]I was telling someone they should play this, and then I was like, wait a second.
[11:57.61]No, actually, I can't recommend this game.
[11:59.39]It's $60.
[12:01.05]You recommended it to me.
[12:02.90]You were like, Vinny and Jerma and Poke, we need to play this.
[12:05.40]Well, but you guys, like, I can.
[12:08.16]Because it's my birthday, and you owe me.
[12:10.34]Alright.
[12:12.63]Okay, but the person I was recommending it was like, poor.
[12:17.49]Yeah, yeah.
[12:19.11]Okay, so here's what I have to say about this game.
[12:22.03]It's very fun.
[12:23.63]You have to just get through the first few missions and you're going to start to understand it.
[12:28.45]You'll start to know what's going on.
[12:31.61]Okay.
[12:31.93]Do you use a plasma core or a turbo core?
[12:37.11]You want to go fast or do you want to conserve energy?
[12:40.73]You actually know the answer.
[12:41.55]That's crazy.
[12:42.41]Okay, I'll just get the turbo.
[12:44.49]I unironically love this franchise.
[12:45.95]It's like, I love this game.
[12:47.23]I love EDF5.
[12:47.93]I love EDF5.
[12:48.62]I love all the EDFs.
[12:51.88]This is the first one that I'd be playing with a mouse and keyboard as well, because EDF5 was controller.
[12:57.34]I've been wanting to play a wing diver where you can actually aim.
[13:00.31]I think you could do keyboard and mouse on PC.
[13:03.27]Wait a second, are we both doing wing diver?
[13:06.44]No, I'm doing Air Raider.
[13:07.38]I guess I'll play Fencer.
[13:09.34]I mean, I was thinking about Ranger just because I've never played one of these really.
[13:13.10]So should I try Fencer or should I start with Ranger?
[13:15.27]I'm going to play Ranger too.
[13:16.79]Stay with Ranger because Fencer for a new player is like...
[13:21.81]it's like you have like eight buttons and it's like this you have three there's two attachments on each arm don't talk don't talk him out of his fantasy do you want to definitely do it but just maybe just see how the game works first okay do you want to yeah no do the first mission as fencer it's a simple it's a simple mission oh we're not okay you know what alright first mission is fencer only and then I'll switch back to ranger I want to get it yeah deep end
[13:48.90]I like playing Ranger.
[13:50.16]The default stuff with the Ranger is good.
[13:52.14]We need to make sure we tell the boys this.
[13:56.80]When you go into your loadout... The game doesn't tell you fucking anything.
[14:01.82]Kind of like Dark Souls in that way.
[14:03.20]That's a wink.
[14:05.95]When you get in here, there's going to be shit all over the ground.
[14:08.31]We're going to kill a bunch of bugs, a bunch of aliens.
[14:11.45]Red and green cases are going to be all over the ground.
[14:15.37]The red case is a permanent health upgrade.
[14:18.71]It says armor on it, but it's a permanent health upgrade to whatever character you are playing.
[14:24.40]So if you're playing a ranger and you, and we, and by the way, if anybody picks these up, it counts for all of us in the game.
[14:30.56]The green cases, the green cases are new weapons or upgrades to previously acquired weapons.
[14:40.07]You got, those are bigger.
[14:41.05]You don't want to get those.
[14:42.47]Whoever is playing wing diver, raise your hand.
[14:45.34]Yo.
[14:45.92]Fuck yeah.
[14:46.94]Alright.
[14:47.40]You're gonna... You are the collector of things.
[14:51.45]Okay.
[14:51.87]If you see a green box on the ground, go grab that green box.
[14:55.65]Yeah.
[14:56.09]So you have like infinite air dashes on Wing Diver.
[15:00.43]It's crazy.
[15:01.57]I got the turbo core.
[15:03.99]We're ready to boost up.
[15:05.55]I think we're pretty much ready to boost up.
[15:07.64]This is like the first mission we find.
[15:09.90]Yeah.
[15:10.06]Alright.
[15:11.06]You guys ready to boost up?
[15:11.68]Is it a hard or... Normal or hard?
[15:12.70]Normal.
[15:13.18]Normal.
[15:15.97]Oh, okay.
[15:16.49]The way the difficulty works in this game is it expects you to infinitely gain those armor boxes.
[15:20.71]So like very hard is like, hey, you have like a thousand armor at this point and stuff unlocked.
[15:26.45]It has like a pretty long, like, prestiging loop.
[15:34.06]There's friendly fire, by the way.
[15:35.16]You can kill each other.
[15:35.96]Let's look at each other.
[15:36.62]Let's look at each other.
[15:37.20]Here, go check it out.
[15:38.10]Oh, sorry.
[15:39.66]Wow.
[15:40.52]Whoa, what did you just do?
[15:41.78]You're cute.
[15:43.16]The graphics are really good.
[15:45.53]Is that a long thing for me?
[15:48.32]I know this is Ster's birthday, but don't make fun of my favorite game.
[15:52.32]No, I wouldn't dare.
[15:54.66]Yeah, we need you to enjoy this so bad.
[15:57.58]I will.
[15:58.10]I'll get into it.
[15:58.72]No, I'm telling you.
[15:59.58]Hey, let's do a prediction.
[16:00.70]I'm going to be Ranger after this.
[16:02.76]Prediction.
[16:03.52]This is going to be everybody in this call's new game that they love.
[16:06.79]And they're going to play it for a week.
[16:08.53]Alright.
[16:08.73]This is my bet.
[16:10.05]Okay.
[16:10.25]Well, Jerry, Saturday Chili.
[16:13.15]Saturday Chili.
[16:14.33]Saturday Chili.
[16:16.61]I'd be into some Saturday Chili.
[16:17.99]Saturday Chili, man.
[16:19.00]You're going the wrong way.
[16:20.89]You're the only person who's played this mission and you're going the wrong way.
[16:24.43]We're just walking around.
[16:26.31]Can you run as slow class?
[16:29.13]You have a dash.
[16:30.50]You have two different jumps, by the way, as fencer.
[16:33.50]You have two different loadouts.
[16:34.88]So when you switch with like mouse wheel, you're going to be able to jump and glide.
[16:40.28]That's interesting.
[16:41.32]Yes.
[16:41.62]And eventually I'll be able to get you a car.
[16:44.53]Really?
[16:44.95]Thank you.
[16:45.57]Really?
[16:46.09]For me?
[16:48.20]Yeah.
[16:48.64]Poke, we need you as eyes in the sky.
[16:50.62]You're going to be dropping stuff from the sky.
[16:52.12]You're going to be eyes.
[16:52.76]You're going to be our ears.
[16:53.52]Okay.
[16:55.10]I'm very high up right now.
[16:57.20]You can run out of fuel.
[17:00.88]And I will accidentally kill you with artillery.
[17:03.66]It's just like Helldivers, except they stole it.
[17:06.14]They stole the whole game from this game.
[17:09.56]I remember I played like a budget PS2 version of EDF.
[17:14.69]They're all budget.
[17:18.41]I think they've been on the same engine since 2009.
[17:25.78]There's some complaints on the reviews of this game that are like, hey, I don't know.
[17:30.28]The performance and the frame rate is kind of bad.
[17:32.46]That's part of the game.
[17:34.98]If you don't get this game to go down to five FPS, you didn't have a good mission.
[17:42.02]These frogs can regen.
[17:44.55]Look, take a look.
[17:45.69]Take a look.
[17:46.21]Perfect.
[17:46.55]Red stuff in here.
[17:47.13]Nice job.
[17:48.85]I got the red stuff.
[17:53.05]And if, by the way, if anybody thinks this game is too easy.
[18:01.88]Oh, you can like break off the limbs.
[18:04.30]Yeah, it's crazy.
[18:05.26]These aliens look just like us.
[18:09.41]These really says a lot about humanity.
[18:11.71]Yeah, yeah.
[18:12.98]You'd think they'd be afraid of water, but they're not.
[18:16.70]This is just the tutorial.
[18:19.95]There's like, isn't there like the same amount of difficulties that there are in Diablo 3 in this game?
[18:28.22]Okay, that's the first minus one.
[18:29.90]Shut up.
[18:30.72]He compared it to D3.
[18:32.64]No, I said difficulties.
[18:33.78]I didn't compare the game to D3.
[18:35.16]I would not do that.
[18:35.92]There's a lot of games with difficulty settings.
[18:38.02]I don't know why you have to go to D3.
[18:39.19]Yo, I can just fling a bus.
[18:42.75]What do you mean?
[18:43.93]I'm so powerful.
[18:45.49]My character can actually just knock a bus off.
[18:50.23]That's awesome.
[18:52.95]This is like the tutorial two.
[18:54.33]The way for you to practice your aim, get used to how it works.
[18:59.91]Right.
[19:02.01]You end up getting some really crazy weapons.
[19:05.94]There also ends up being somewhere around 500 to 1,000 things on the screen at the same time.
[19:11.52]Oh, cool.
[19:12.38]It's going to get crazy.
[19:13.68]Okay.
[19:15.56]This game starts really slow.
[19:17.20]The first mission, Media 5, is like...
[19:21.15]like 500 enemies now how do you know when you have the range to hit an enemy because I can't I can't tell and I'm too slow to get there uh you kind of just those ones are pretty short range on the the spikes okay you get like mortars and stuff though
[19:41.23]I think you have a spear.
[19:46.05]It's a big rail gun that comes out of your arm.
[19:49.28]Yeah, I've been enjoying that.
[19:50.62]That thing is very deadly.
[19:52.20]The gatling gun actually is... Bugs!
[19:55.32]Oh, no.
[19:56.28]He's right.
[19:58.92]Oh, there's a lot of bugs.
[20:00.52]The frogs have physics.
[20:01.94]They're like corpse physics.
[20:02.78]A lot of bugs here.
[20:03.82]Never mind.
[20:05.36]We got incoming!
[20:09.26]Do I get like a nuke later?
[20:11.16]Yeah, you actually do from the sky.
[20:13.96]Wait, sick.
[20:16.98]It's really easy to get overwhelmed in this game, so always be picking off stuff as you're walking around, even if you think you're far away.
[20:22.49]Oh, Jerma, your title, you forgot to put ad.
[20:25.85]Huh?
[20:29.01]Am I talking like it's an ad?
[20:30.57]Yes.
[20:31.11]What?
[20:31.75]I just like the game.
[20:32.65]I just like the game.
[20:34.97]I was just looking out for you, bro.
[20:36.05]Sorry about that.
[20:40.02]Everyone check out EDF.
[20:41.06]It's on... It's on Steam, but you need the Epic Games Store to use it.
[20:46.78]So you're going to want to get both.
[20:48.24]You guys see the bugs?
[20:49.26]There are ants everywhere.
[20:51.53]Oh, shit.
[20:52.35]Oops.
[20:52.81]By the way, this friendly fire and this self-inflicted fire.
[20:56.55]Oh, I'm so fucked then.
[20:58.85]Yeah, I'm throwing a lot of mortars on you guys, so hopefully I'm not killing you at this point.
[21:04.32]Yeah, switch to non-explosives if you have it during close encounters.
[21:08.45]uh these why are these ants so juicy they're kind of juicy aren't they yeah they're very juicy oops sorry so Jerm I just picked up green weapon what does that do is that just ammo green weapon at the end of this level we're going to get a screen that's going to show you because you picked that up every one of us gets a new weapon
[21:31.86]That's cool.
[21:33.10]Or it could be an upgrade of one that you currently already have.
[21:35.82]And there are a ton of versions of every weapon.
[21:38.92]Okay.
[21:40.80]Stuff like accuracy, reload speed, or... So what's the best class?
[21:46.73]Winged Diver.
[21:49.15]The debate rages on, apparently.
[21:51.39]Nah, I'm Winged Diver.
[21:58.45]Winged Diver probably is arguably the best class, but Winged Diver doesn't have a whole lot of health.
[22:07.29]Yeah, I won't get hit.
[22:08.07]It's fine.
[22:09.47]That's the thing.
[22:10.85]I got confidence that folks got this locked down.
[22:16.32]Yeah, I have to switch away from Fencer.
[22:18.46]I can't do this.
[22:20.12]Okay, that's why I said do it for the first mission because you'll know right away if you hate it or not.
[22:25.33]okay I think they're more fun when they get like artillery yeah that seems yeah that seems like a more fun thing but right now I'm just gonna go back to ranger after this have you been using the gatling guns uh yeah
[22:40.68]that kind of hit yeah you know yeah a little bit it's just one gatling gun right now because the other hand is a shield you can revive so the way that so if you die if your health is a zero somebody has to like compress E on you but it takes what like 50% of your health to give it to the other person I think and then once everybody is dead we lose dude you're acting like it's your birthday haha
[23:13.00]I'm glad I got her.
[23:14.26]I was going for at least that.
[23:18.56]Yeah, that was like a text chat.
[23:20.28]H-A-H-A.
[23:22.64]Lowercase L-O-L.
[23:23.68]I'm going to die.
[23:26.94]Okay, now I'm not going to die anymore.
[23:28.20]Okay.
[23:29.57]So, alright, listen.
[23:30.49]I just have to ask, Ster, when are we going to talk about the Jersey Shore?
[23:33.21]It happens every time.
[23:35.29]And then I act surprised because then I forgot that you were there, and then we just play this whole thing out over and over and over again ad nauseam.
[23:44.09]Love the Jersey Shore.
[23:46.05]Taylor Ham pork roll?
[23:47.99]Haven't been in a long time.
[23:49.74]Also, the green blips on your mini-map are crates.
[23:54.28]Oh, okay.
[23:55.20]Just to let everybody know.
[23:55.98]Thanks, Jarmo.
[23:57.28]I was watching a documentary on the Jersey Shore like a week ago.
[24:02.49]I forgot what town it is already.
[24:03.87]The one that you're not allowed to have alcohol in the whole town.
[24:07.42]Ocean City.
[24:08.44]Yeah, they got prohibition going on still in New Jersey.
[24:10.68]Is that a new thing?
[24:13.30]Like, is it because of Jersey Shore?
[24:16.20]Uh, I mean, that helps motivate them.
[24:19.06]That's, like, part of their argument.
[24:20.78]It's like, we want to keep that out of here.
[24:22.24]But if you drive over the bridge, it's, like, the largest alcohol, like, emporium.
[24:29.78]Like, right in the next town.
[24:32.10]And it's a utopia.
[24:35.78]I'm going to say it.
[24:36.28]I think we can handle hard.
[24:38.20]Yeah.
[24:39.64]Okay.
[24:41.55]Also on the higher difficulties, better stuff drops.
[24:45.31]Oh, it is Diablesque.
[24:47.87]Okay, so let me give you a reference here.
[24:49.58]You know how when you change your stream settings to go from like fast to like faster and it's like uses 100% more of resources to go that for your CPU.
[25:00.96]Going from normal to hard is actually like a massive jump.
[25:03.92]It's like really actually very hard.
[25:06.12]That's a weird... Like Diablo?
[25:09.92]Yeah, like Diablo 3.
[25:13.06]You guys know that game.
[25:15.48]Yeah.
[25:19.81]So I've just been excited for EDF for like a month and you got my hopes up last month on your fake birthday.
[25:23.89]I told Jerma he wasn't allowed to play until I played.
[25:26.79]He actually said that.
[25:28.57]He was going to stream it without me and I was very upset.
[25:32.44]And then you guys were kind enough to wait for me.
[25:34.90]Then he started, he punched me and he threw his glass of wine at me at the bar.
[25:38.86]We got in this whole fight.
[25:40.28]Like Dracula.
[25:41.96]Just like Dracula.
[25:44.03]Wait, who's Dracula in this scenario?
[25:45.69]Me?
[25:46.89]Yeah, you threw your wine glass.
[25:50.43]Dracula's pretty fucking lit.
[25:51.67]I don't know.
[25:52.07]That's fine with me.
[25:52.89]Yeah, he throws his... He goes, what is a man?
[25:55.81]A miserable little pile of secrets?
[25:59.13]Remember that?
[26:00.51]Is it from Dracula?
[26:01.99]Chatter, how do I call in my vehicle?
[26:04.63]I don't watch movies.
[26:06.39]Oh.
[26:12.69]See you.
[26:13.03]Thank you.
[26:15.02]oh you can do okay so here we go so this is all the new stuff you got just for this class though well the left one is which class it is oh sorry I'm dumb I should have read that so yeah I was kind of incorrect and what I'm when you pick up a green box there's like a 70 chance it's going to be for the class you're currently playing so you will get some other stuff for other classes okay I've got so much loot
[26:43.82]Yep.
[26:44.28]This is where it begins.
[26:44.98]The dopamine hits are strong.
[26:46.88]Wait, so is there like a lot of loot in this game?
[26:49.02]A lot.
[26:49.44]I like that.
[26:50.08]I like that.
[26:50.66]Like tons.
[26:51.74]I would call it an un-fucking-believable amount.
[26:54.78]This is what I would call it.
[26:57.20]That's fair.
[26:58.55]Okay, I'm in.
[26:59.95]Yeah, he's in.
[27:01.23]Yeah.
[27:02.39]That's right.
[27:03.15]Basically, every single mission, you're going to go, oh, I want to try this one.
[27:05.99]Oh, I love that.
[27:07.13]Yep.
[27:07.43]I like that.
[27:07.97]I like that.
[27:08.97]I already got a sniper rifle.
[27:10.67]Game over.
[27:12.15]Got a closed laser, a spark vine.
[27:15.25]I'm ready.
[27:15.75]Oh, that should be mine.
[27:16.79]It also is worth reading, like kind of reading the little paragraph that tells what it does.
[27:21.05]Because this is like a rocket launcher.
[27:23.44]Like, oh, the Grant M31 versus the Cascade Zero.
[27:26.84]They are so unbelievably different.
[27:28.48]It's not just like, oh, shoot a rocket.
[27:29.90]It's like, oh, you have to lock on, wait three seconds, and then fire eight missiles at the same time.
[27:34.18]It's worth reading it.
[27:36.19]I set it to hard.
[27:37.81]Good.
[27:39.38]But I want to put on my new things.
[27:42.66]We're going to have plenty of time.
[27:44.20]Okay.
[27:46.64]Yeah, I'm going back to Ranger.
[27:48.00]Sorry, guys.
[27:49.28]Ranger's good.
[27:51.34]I got the first thing I can kill you all with.
[27:52.98]I'm going to fuck up the whole group, but it's fine.
[27:54.48]It's whatever.
[27:54.88]Yeah, dude.
[27:57.38]The vibes are now rotten.
[27:59.14]We might have to go back to normal, but it's alright.
[28:00.48]We will.
[28:03.76]Oh, and you can change the color of your equipment as well.
[28:06.48]You can do like a... You can change like the different... No way.
[28:11.58]The equipment?
[28:13.27]No, like your character, I guess.
[28:14.29]So like change the color.
[28:17.03]That'll be an EDF 7.
[28:19.23]No, it will not.
[28:21.53]Nothing will change.
[28:23.91]Nothing will change in the next one.
[28:26.03]EDF has a cycle of they put out one with a number and then they do one with a weird name and everybody hates it that some other studio made and it's weird.
[28:33.63]And then you'll get EDF 7 in like four or five years.
[28:37.95]I'm just glad we got more missions and I have been spoiled on an enemy type.
[28:43.95]And I will tell you.
[28:44.91]Whoa.
[28:46.71]I can't fucking wait.
[28:48.94]Stop saying add.
[28:49.94]I like games.
[28:50.60]I like the games.
[28:51.26]Hashtag add.
[28:57.22]yeah kind of uh I like the game didn't you know that like it's not cool to like things yeah right why right I like things uh semi unironically true
[29:14.96]I'll try it.
[29:15.60]This is a different mission, right?
[29:18.26]Did I pick the next one or did I have to?
[29:20.70]You may have picked the one we just did.
[29:23.30]Let's find out.
[29:25.22]If it's frogs immediately, then... The host has chosen to retreat.
[29:30.01]Yeah, I'm a coward.
[29:31.43]We didn't even get any items.
[29:34.55]The city will be destroyed.
[29:36.05]Okay, no, that is the correct mission.
[29:38.05]I just wanted to be sure.
[29:40.59]My new weapon is crazy.
[29:43.45]What'd you end up picking?
[29:44.73]Some weird, like, just a pure laser.
[29:47.30]Nice.
[29:48.28]Look at this.
[29:48.62]Look at this.
[29:48.96]Look at this.
[29:50.26]Ready?
[29:50.88]Mm-hmm.
[29:53.68]Oh, wow.
[29:55.46]It is green.
[29:56.36]That's the same color as you.
[29:59.01]Yes.
[29:59.93]You're the green.
[30:00.55]The green goblin.
[30:01.45]You're the green ranger.
[30:03.05]Alright, I'm going to have to, like, listen.
[30:05.51]I know that I'm, like, the green guy usually, but I'll switch.
[30:07.87]I'll switch for poke.
[30:09.09]I mean, I read your DM.
[30:10.13]I don't really care.
[30:11.40]I'm blue guy.
[30:13.28]That was in the other group, poke.
[30:15.87]Hey, can you please switch off green?
[30:17.62]And those of you watching on my stream that want to try to tell me that the range on this thing isn't that good.
[30:22.76]Okay, we'll go ahead and test your theory.
[30:25.90]Alright, you can be green next round, but... A little bit of drama starting.
[30:31.85]Give me five shots to kill one ant.
[30:35.35]First EDF drama.
[30:37.09]Wait, how do I scout bomber?
[30:38.31]What the fuck is this?
[30:44.75]God, the fucking explosions of, like, guts from the bugs is so satisfying.
[30:51.56]Oh, sounds like people will start to enjoy this.
[30:55.26]I was told to say that.
[30:57.34]The first unprompted compliment.
[31:00.48]Oh, okay.
[31:04.20]Game's kind of pretty fun.
[31:07.22]It's alright.
[31:07.85]I mean, it's whatever.
[31:11.13]Alright, let me walk around.
[31:15.17]That's alright.
[31:21.65]That tutorial, though, had me worried.
[31:23.71]I got to be honest.
[31:25.41]I was like, oh, no.
[31:26.33]Yeah, that's one of the worst tutorials of any game ever made in human history.
[31:30.83]Oh, they're limiting my power for these first missions.
[31:36.09]They're not allowing me to use certain things yet.
[31:39.21]You can turn that off if you want.
[31:42.09]Wait, what do you mean?
[31:43.94]Did you get something high level that you can't air Raider?
[31:46.92]They're limiting like your Collins.
[31:48.70]They they know that you are a God and they don't want you to.
[31:53.54]Be too strong.
[31:56.21]I see like I can't call in a. Scout bomber how to use your special.
[32:03.71]It's either FZ.
[32:06.37]I got it.
[32:09.35]Oops, what does this do?
[32:12.27]Electromagnetic shaft.
[32:16.01]Nothing happened.
[32:16.63]Oh, because we're playing it hard.
[32:21.46]That's right.
[32:21.78]That's why it takes.
[32:22.52]Yeah, this is this is hot.
[32:25.88]Wicked fucking hot.
[32:27.04]Oh, poke.
[32:27.98]I just exploded you.
[32:29.10]I'm so sorry.
[32:30.02]Wait, you can hear me?
[32:30.81]Yeah, I'm down a gun.
[32:32.75]Oh, sorry.
[32:33.19]I just killed you.
[32:33.73]These drones are crazy on Air Raider, though.
[32:40.63]the models when you hit them they just jank out a little bit it's just it's like very very funny I mean in a loving way Jerma like a loving way no no lovingly janked out this is so bad but like so good this is one of the most cooked games ever like don't trust me oh yeah like really oh dude they have the fucking roly polies again just wait till you see the enemy that I'm talking about do they look just like us
[33:09.29]oh no oh no it is going to it it is horrifying and I mean it it's just a house centipede horrifying oh we got like a big alien dome over there wait what oh yeah what is that strange oh what the an anchor yeah the sponsored brief told me about these can't wait till everybody at the end of this stream is like god I wish I was as excited as he was in the beginning
[33:39.71]I wish I could feel joy.
[33:40.79]We should play all the EDFs.
[33:46.99]EDFs.
[33:49.23]Well, I got good news for you, Poke.
[33:51.27]They put all of them in this one.
[33:53.43]I was going to say, you have problems.
[33:54.99]They really did.
[33:55.83]It's like all the games just kind of combine into one game.
[34:01.62]It's like a sequel.
[34:04.54]When EDF 6 comes out, EDF 5 is now EDF 6.
[34:07.24]It's like part of the game.
[34:11.14]This one's a little bit more crunchy-looking.
[34:13.70]I think so, yeah.
[34:14.40]I feel like everything has a grit texture on it.
[34:18.58]Yeah, I noticed that.
[34:19.53]Yeah, it's very gritty.
[34:22.67]Well, because did you see the story in the beginning?
[34:25.53]It's a great story.
[34:27.19]That we've already saved Earth?
[34:29.45]Yeah, that's what you do in the last game, by the way, and also all five before that.
[34:33.13]I need health.
[34:33.73]Well, it's a good thing we've saved Earth.
[34:35.47]Look how beautiful it is.
[34:36.47]This place is basically a utopia, aside from these ants.
[34:40.73]Yeah, everything really is all fucked up, isn't it?
[34:43.11]This place is already done, let's just nuke it.
[34:46.73]Can't save anything here.
[34:48.09]Exactly!
[34:49.05]Why aren't we Orbitally nuking this place?
[34:50.93]Because it's only level 4 and they won't let me do it yet.
[34:54.37]You just Airdrop booked that ant.
[35:00.20]If these were the ruins of New York, the rent would still be like $2,000 for a closet.
[35:07.41]That building we just destroyed.
[35:08.75]So I'm just going to ask, is this the only genre of games we play together?
[35:12.71]Bug games.
[35:13.56]Either we run from bugs or we shoot at them.
[35:17.86]We run from bugs.
[35:18.52]Why don't we play like Yahtzee or something one night?
[35:20.96]Helldivers.
[35:23.30]Well, Helldivers, it's just convenient that this came out at this time.
[35:29.86]I've been talking to my chat about playing this on my birthday for almost two years.
[35:34.99]and you're you're hating me I love it I'm actually having a great time I'm telling you just wait till you see that enemy and all of a sudden I want to see reactions I can't wait for the clip the Twitch clips reactions of all these streamers in here that we're gonna get to see oh man I should get on camera nah okay bro I'm gonna die I'm dead
[36:02.96]I'm gonna go get Saturday chili.
[36:05.64]Help me.
[36:09.83]You guys make any new foods lately?
[36:12.29]Oh, I've been cooking up a storm.
[36:17.12]I just made my rotten cinnamon buns around the holidays, and they were used as a lava texture in a video game, so that should tell you how well I did.
[36:26.26]Wait, press the vehicle button to perform a rescue.
[36:28.94]Why am I still lying here?
[36:30.56]E. Oh, it's E. There you go.
[36:32.46]Thank you.
[36:34.44]Oh, there goes all my health.
[36:36.28]Is there health?
[36:36.62]I think there's health over here.
[36:37.58]Looks like there's something over here.
[36:39.26]Oh, yeah.
[36:39.52]You don't share the health kits, by the way, if you've been, like, wing-divering them.
[36:44.85]Stop taking heals at full HP.
[36:46.45]Oh, sorry about that.
[36:48.86]Yeah.
[36:49.98]I mean, since you guys asked, I learned how to make Salsa.
[36:54.09]Wait, you did really?
[36:58.95]Yeah.
[36:59.51]How is it?
[37:00.63]I think I saw you do that on stream.
[37:02.43]I was just researching, honestly.
[37:05.58]I saw the research.
[37:07.02]Did you cook the chilies first or did you not cook the chilies?
[37:09.92]I boiled the tomatoes and jalapenos and garlic.
[37:13.12]I boiled them.
[37:14.36]That sounds pretty good.
[37:15.72]Yeah, then I blended it.
[37:17.23]It was really good.
[37:19.30]I just didn't know you can make salsa.
[37:20.66]I thought it was like a lab thing, you know?
[37:23.36]Right.
[37:24.10]Lab grown salsa.
[37:25.36]Okay, if I saw lab grown salsa on the shelf, I don't think I'm going to buy it.
[37:32.02]I would.
[37:33.75]Yeah, do you have the proper density test tube for it?
[37:37.55]Or did you just use like kitchen stuff?
[37:40.11]Blender.
[37:41.83]Blender.
[37:43.41]Oh, you've made a 3D model of it.
[37:44.69]That's sick.
[37:45.58]Yeah.
[37:46.54]Oh, we can see when you paint the ground with like an explosive, I think.
[37:50.48]Yeah.
[37:51.78]I don't think these ones will hurt you.
[37:54.63]Because it's just at this point that my drone shooting machine gun.
[37:59.00]So you put down- that's kind of cool. So you put down a thing and they all fly over there?
[38:01.00]How do you melee? Is there a melee?
[38:04.00]You get like five different drone abilities - so you like tag with drones and then you can throw a drone and then there's like other mortar drones.
[38:11.00]Oh, new mobs!
[38:13.00]Uh, melee- uh Vinny is a fencer is- I think fencer and wing diver are the only ones that have melee.
[38:18.00]Gotcha. Okay. I was just trying to shoot a car and I got it- it was cool.
[38:21.00]It might even just be fencer.
[38:28.00]So you guys ever make salsa or no?
[38:30.00]No.
[38:31.00]No, I've made hummus before. Does that count?
[38:36.00]Is that like a greek salsa?
[38:37.00]I mean it's like you can put it in a blender and it's like you put up- you mush a bunch of beans up and tahini- tahini's like one of my favorite things on Earth.
[38:45.00]Tahini, chickpeas.
[38:47.50]Oh, I can't- I can't get enough of it.
[38:53.21]I've made, like, you know what?
[38:54.11]I've made a basic salsa, but not one that's, like, in-depth for, like, chip dip, but more for, like, here's some tomatoes, onion, and, like, oil, salt, pepper, and lime juice.
[39:03.64]Just that kind of thing.
[39:04.68]Does that count?
[39:06.04]Yeah, you're making your own sauce?
[39:07.48]You're making your own... Like a pico de gallo?
[39:11.40]Yeah.
[39:12.40]Cool.
[39:13.26]Yeah, it was alright.
[39:13.94]It was just, like, one of those meal kits was, like, put this on taco, and it was like, alright, cool.
[39:22.76]That's valid.
[39:23.90]Yeah, that's valid.
[39:24.98]It's not as cool as, like, what you did, Poke.
[39:27.00]I know.
[39:28.78]I mean, sorry.
[39:29.26]I mean, yeah.
[39:30.38]I'm pretty impressed by you.
[39:33.42]I feel like you're winning the conversation.
[39:35.50]So what's the exact kind of recipe?
[39:37.12]I'm going to let Jerma win with the egg salad thing.
[39:40.14]So, like, I got to...
[39:41.99]Well, that's how humble you are, too, so you won there, too.
[39:44.86]Thank you.
[39:47.34]Hold on, I'm dead again, but I have an important question.
[39:48.88]Did you eat the egg salad?
[39:51.62]What do you mean?
[39:52.24]Did you make the egg salad I made?
[39:54.92]No, I just remembered that you said yours is better than mine, so I was like, I learned something new.
[40:00.42]I gotta try your salsa.
[40:01.62]I gotta get an exact recipe.
[40:02.98]Oh, God, the camera.
[40:06.30]Oh, we got to hold this together.
[40:08.18]I see a Transformers truck coming in about being turned into an Autobot.
[40:12.60]Poke, I got you.
[40:13.62]Thank you.
[40:14.70]I'll try.
[40:15.69]My character comes to a skid.
[40:16.93]Hang on.
[40:18.31]Wait, how do I do this?
[40:19.35]What's the button?
[40:20.15]The vehicle button.
[40:21.77]E-E-E-E-E.
[40:23.61]The vehicle slash rescue.
[40:26.63]Just wait till I get my first 20 shot missile launcher and it's going to be over.
[40:31.02]Just wait until they don't let me do air call-ins or call-in vehicles yet.
[40:36.67]You'll be alright.
[40:39.49]Hey, they're making it harder.
[40:40.35]My hands are... I'm handcuffed to a chair.
[40:44.15]Dude.
[40:44.99]With a bag on my head right now.
[40:49.84]And I have a fucking bow on my head.
[40:50.98]Wait, I'm actually dying.
[40:51.66]Like, I'm gift-wrapped.
[40:53.62]I got you, bro.
[40:54.84]I'm coming.
[40:55.42]I won't die again.
[40:56.02]Hey, it is... It happens.
[40:59.58]It's hard.
[41:03.82]You get to drive it like a vehicle, like these things.
[41:07.72]You get a full-sized building Gundam.
[41:12.60]Yeah, Ray!
[41:13.26]Got you.
[41:16.82]Alright, now let's actually pull together because we could die right here.
[41:20.54]Big bug!
[41:22.86]It's squirting!
[41:24.66]Okay, I'm staying away from the forbidden jelly.
[41:29.00]Kill whatever that is.
[41:32.38]Does it have weak points, Jerma?
[41:34.50]I don't actually know.
[41:35.34]Probably not.
[41:35.82]Maybe in the head?
[41:37.94]Uh, I know that sometimes they do, but I don't know what it is.
[41:41.61]Oh, this is bad.
[41:42.45]This is actually really bad.
[41:43.45]I'm in trouble.
[41:44.23]I'm gonna die again.
[41:46.31]Yeah, we're a bit overwhelmed, and if we don't beat the mission, we don't get our items.
[41:49.81]We do not get items if we lose.
[41:51.57]Oh no, the bugs are here.
[41:53.69]Oh no.
[41:54.73]I'm probably gonna die.
[41:58.23]That was quick.
[41:59.01]Uh-oh.
[41:59.39]Yeah, because I'm not allowed to use half my freaking load out.
[42:04.23]Trying to think of a plan here.
[42:05.11]Okay, your plan, Poke, should be just to fly and pick up as much health as possible and then fly around and try to pick up, like, Ster.
[42:13.73]There's a shitload of cases over here.
[42:15.53]I see it right there.
[42:18.05]Okay, okay, I'm going for it.
[42:19.01]Yeah, Wing Diver is clutch.
[42:20.27]You got this, dude.
[42:20.88]Yeah, Wing Diver is absolutely one of the best.
[42:23.24]There you go.
[42:24.96]Fill up.
[42:25.52]Get your house to full.
[42:26.12]Especially on ant stage.
[42:28.74]And then just start picking up people.
[42:32.19]With the vehicle button.
[42:34.39]And you can just, like, fly by them.
[42:35.37]Oh, it's instant.
[42:35.73]Yeah.
[42:35.83]Oh, my God, that took a lot of hits.
[42:39.23]It's instant res.
[42:41.29]Yeah, as long as you're within a tiny little area.
[42:45.29]Alright, everybody go get health.
[42:48.99]Look, okay.
[42:53.62]Down.
[42:56.80]I think I took a chunk of them.
[43:02.58]I don't think that's health.
[43:04.22]Maybe it is.
[43:04.82]No, no.
[43:05.54]I'll get you.
[43:07.30]Who's down right now?
[43:08.50]You, Ster?
[43:08.78]Coming, Ster.
[43:09.68]You got Ster?
[43:11.47]Yes!
[43:11.79]Oh, I died resing you!
[43:13.79]Oh, I got the boss on me!
[43:15.45]Oh, I'm gonna... Oh, God.
[43:16.73]Oh, my God.
[43:21.45]The giant thing that's shooting... I'm coming.
[43:26.64]Alright.
[43:28.78]Poke, when I res you, just turbocharge into the air and get out of here.
[43:32.98]Yes, yes.
[43:33.74]I will.
[43:34.64]I'll try to distract.
[43:37.72]Oh, come on, don't do that shit to me right now.
[43:40.02]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[43:41.64]Oh my god, I ran into a lip and I couldn't get over it.
[43:48.37]A lip on the ground.
[43:50.17]I attracted it away from you guys.
[43:57.61]Yes!
[43:58.05]We're all dead.
[43:59.77]Oh no!
[44:01.82]Vinny, no!
[44:02.74]The forbidden jelly.
[44:03.74]I'm not fast enough to escape the forbidden jelly.
[44:05.74]I'm gonna die.
[44:06.58]There's no way I'm gonna live.
[44:07.54]Well, this is a good lesson.
[44:08.72]EDF is hard, and we can get it, but we have to coordinate.
[44:13.63]Dude, seriously, half my loadout doesn't function yet.
[44:17.21]I'm not allowed.
[44:18.91]My main weapon sucks.
[44:20.13]I got a bad one.
[44:22.25]Did you use that laser one that you just, like, chainsaw through things?
[44:25.67]It's like a blue laser.
[44:27.71]Spark vine.
[44:28.35]I did not like it.
[44:29.05]The one you start with is, uh... is really fun.
[44:32.83]I also forgot... Yeah, that one was way better.
[44:34.21]I forgot that you can't be holding a direction if you want to jump.
[44:38.53]You have to let go of everything and press space to start jumping and then press W to move forward.
[44:43.79]That's what happened.
[44:44.99]I actually think we got something.
[44:45.99]Yeah, no, we got a consolation prize.
[44:49.61]Okay.
[44:50.39]I'm happy with that.
[44:52.50]we're gonna have to run it back because yeah if an equipment is red then you can't actually use it in the mission which might only apply to me and I brought two of them also I'm a chump are you sure because I think red also might mean that you need to like build up in-game like credits to buy it like in a mission
[45:16.46]No, no, you have to build up the credits to call in the vehicle, but it also they're not letting me call it in at all.
[45:21.72]These are like I'm not allowed to use them.
[45:25.44]So like the cave missions, you can't like call in bombers.
[45:29.84]You know.
[45:31.10]But I'm being I'm being nerfed, OK?
[45:35.11]Lightning bow or bolt gun.
[45:38.39]Apparently it's for.
[45:42.05]Story reasons.
[45:43.53]Did you use the rapier poke?
[45:47.78]uh there's beekeepers in this game oh yeah the one where you like hold click and then like go yeah yeah I like that one it was good I kind of want to try them all though you know what I mean yeah because you probably just got new things I think you need to be a super weapon you need to be higher on the way now that's or do you big plasma plasma big cannon alright I'm ready
[46:15.96]are we sticking with hard I think we can do it we just gotta okay we just gotta go for it okay yeah I gotta have I gotta have items I'm going with the air tortoise this thing is ridiculous alright I'm ready alright I'm sitting up now are you laying down that's how he came oh I got a uh I have a item I can put down a life like dispenser
[46:46.15]Ooh, that would be a big deal.
[46:47.57]I didn't think we were going to need it, but apparently we need it.
[46:53.29]Let's just go for it.
[46:54.21]We got this.
[46:56.29]Lounging Larry's?
[46:57.39]A little bit.
[46:58.17]I think Ranger also gets goo guns to heal allies.
[47:01.21]Hey, put your eyes over here and look at what I'm about to do with this.
[47:05.80]Whoa.
[47:07.36]He's going to rocket jump.
[47:10.84]Hey, I'm not going to lie.
[47:12.44]I'm going to tell the truth right now.
[47:15.45]I had fun.
[47:16.67]Yeah.
[47:16.93]Last round.
[47:17.93]I had fun.
[47:18.81]Gotta go, guys.
[47:19.51]Alright.
[47:22.99]Let's see.
[47:24.11]I didn't have fun running from Jelly, but I had fun with everything else.
[47:29.23]We need to focus on the big Jelly.
[47:32.67]I think it's a queen or something.
[47:33.95]I don't know, but we need to focus it big time.
[47:36.27]Okay.
[47:44.37]What is it?
[47:47.98]Oh no, my new gun is not it.
[47:51.86]It takes so long to lock this thing on.
[48:00.15]Oh my god, what?
[48:03.95]Kind of like my new gun.
[48:09.45]I'm happy with it.
[48:14.17]Why won't this be ready to shoot?
[48:20.19]I'm looking at what my stuff even does.
[48:23.65]Oh, yeah, I have stuff that can probably kill the big bug real quick this time.
[48:28.55]Why is this tick so... What?
[48:31.15]Are you using the air tortoise?
[48:32.03]Yeah, that didn't take that long before.
[48:33.91]Oh, my.
[48:35.75]Well, it's going to look cool.
[48:37.69]If you have those lock on weapons as well, I'm... Do you know the Muninites shooting their ultimate pixel?
[48:49.46]Uh, yes, from Akakin, yes.
[48:51.34]Yeah.
[48:52.26]They're in New Jersey, by the way.
[48:54.20]Of course.
[48:55.62]Oh, those are the ones that go like this.
[48:57.77]Right?
[48:58.25]Yes.
[49:02.55]Another one sounds like this.
[49:05.55]No, that's MLG Grandpa.
[49:07.25]And one sounds like this.
[49:10.51]You know something, M1?
[49:13.49]I'm just not having it.
[49:14.97]And I think that you deserve to die.
[49:18.05]I've been a little desirable dial.
[49:19.87]We can pull the show.
[49:20.55]We can do the show right now.
[49:21.43]We can do the show right now.
[49:23.69]Am I in an episode?
[49:25.67]You might be.
[49:28.86]Who could I be?
[49:31.90]Carl.
[49:33.42]What does he sound like?
[49:35.24]The meat man.
[49:37.20]I don't know.
[49:38.44]Danny DeVito-ish.
[49:39.70]You think that's good enough?
[49:40.88]What are you doing, you freaking shake man?
[49:42.66]Hey, get your head in the game.
[49:44.72]There you go.
[49:47.73]Yeah, that's pretty good.
[49:49.07]You guys can be real with me.
[49:50.76]You guys can be real.
[49:51.68]I actually liked it a lot.
[49:55.62]That was actually great.
[49:56.56]I appreciate that, guys.
[49:57.79]Thank you.
[49:59.07]There you go.
[49:59.75]You got it.
[50:01.87]We're actually doing pretty good.
[50:03.67]The air tortoise destroys entire buildings.
[50:06.79]Yeah, it does.
[50:07.66]It's a horribly destructive.
[50:09.96]It takes so long to fire, and then it takes even longer to get there.
[50:14.50]Alright, so Vinny, we have to coordinate when we're going to shoot at something.
[50:17.98]Okay.
[50:18.92]For like a boss, especially, you and I can really take that down.
[50:21.72]Because we will do like 1,000 or 2,000 damage.
[50:24.66]Wait, did we go backwards?
[50:27.00]What do you mean?
[50:29.45]This is the other mission.
[50:30.46]Are you sure?
[50:31.72]With the... Wait.
[50:33.80]No, this was the mission that we failed.
[50:35.58]Is it?
[50:35.82]This is the one where we have to destroy the teleporter.
[50:40.00]We need to lock in because here they come.
[50:41.72]Lock in.
[50:42.52]Okay.
[50:43.55]The mission was just long.
[50:44.51]I thought they were two separate ones.
[50:45.79]It's a long mission.
[50:53.50]And, guys, at the end of each mission, it shows, like, a Left 4 Dead, how many, like, headshot accuracy, how many kills you had, so don't get embarrassed here.
[51:00.69]Yeah, worst guy gets kicked.
[51:03.19]Right.
[51:05.49]Clutch or kick.
[51:11.25]This is bad.
[51:11.75]I gotta run.
[51:13.04]This is very bad.
[51:13.56]I feel like I'm killing my teammates.
[51:15.66]I'm something... I'm hurt.
[51:18.09]Wait, you feel like you are killing them or you feel like you want to?
[51:21.87]My gun is just exploding everything.
[51:23.83]I think you guys must be getting hurt, you know?
[51:26.62]Oh, I think I got hurt by the enemies, honestly.
[51:28.52]I don't think it was you.
[51:32.44]If we need the... Well, I don't need it yet, but I do have the healing station.
[51:38.14]I took a chunk, but I'm alright.
[51:39.19]As long as Vinny isn't taking all the health kits this time.
[51:41.45]On my freaking birthday.
[51:44.37]No.
[51:45.13]No, no, I'm good.
[51:46.61]Actually, we share them.
[51:49.66]Wait, do we share them?
[51:51.86]Right?
[51:52.42]Not the health kits.
[51:53.18]You share everything but the health kits.
[51:55.00]Oh, man.
[51:55.76]Oh, can I just say that I love your TTS voice when it's that voice.
[52:00.96]Which one?
[52:01.42]This one here?
[52:02.20]Yes.
[52:02.82]It's like one of my favorite things in the world right now.
[52:04.68]You know it's me?
[52:07.08]You know it's my voice?
[52:08.96]But it's just so funny.
[52:10.50]People just... Dude.
[52:12.92]There was one time where... How are you going to make your own TTS?
[52:15.61]Oh, because I can't.
[52:16.65]It would drive me fucking crazy, dude.
[52:18.67]I can't do it.
[52:19.58]Yeah, it pisses me off.
[52:20.98]There's an item here.
[52:22.66]I had one, the one Criken used of me recently.
[52:26.36]It was too uncanny.
[52:27.84]Yeah, that one's funny too.
[52:29.40]Wait, you guys turn your own voices into text-to-speech?
[52:32.58]Yeah.
[52:33.50]How do you do that?
[52:35.22]This website, I'll show you later.
[52:36.80]Okay, thank you.
[52:37.62]Dude, somebody did a TTS of that voice book, and I think about it all the time.
[52:42.78]I swear to God.
[52:43.90]You know how it says?
[52:44.62]Can you recite it?
[52:45.66]Yes.
[52:46.62]They said...
[52:48.45]Have you guys seen that new Fallout show?
[52:51.53]It's really got me interested in the lore of the vault.
[52:57.06]And it lives rent-free in my head.
[52:58.42]I say it all the time.
[52:59.44]It's like one of the funniest things I've ever heard.
[53:00.72]I remember that one.
[53:04.89]It's perfect in every way.
[53:07.71]Thank you.
[53:08.51]Especially because it's like the volume is a little like a lot lower than you.
[53:12.91]So it just sounds like this some fucking just dude in your room who's trying to talk to you.
[53:18.75]And you're just ignoring every it's like he's like a little dude in your room and just ignoring everything he says.
[53:24.76]It's so funny.
[53:28.12]Oh, folks dead.
[53:29.08]Oh, no, I got it.
[53:29.84]Don't worry.
[53:31.52]I laugh hard.
[53:32.30]I laugh too hard.
[53:32.84]I died.
[53:34.46]Thank you.
[53:35.06]Hey, you know what they say?
[53:36.02]You laugh, you lose.
[53:36.56]I'm dead.
[53:38.68]People say that when they laugh so hard.
[53:39.88]I'm dead.
[53:41.56]They do sometimes.
[53:43.96]There is a obelisk that is still here.
[53:46.99]It was spawning so many things.
[53:51.55]Okay, I nuked it.
[53:53.67]I just needed eyes on, you know what I mean?
[53:55.25]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[54:04.36]Anybody got eyes on a health kit?
[54:08.04]I can turn the station down.
[54:10.51]You have a heal station?
[54:12.57]Yeah, where are we?
[54:15.37]I think I'm alright.
[54:16.91]I'll be alright.
[54:17.63]Come here, Saturday.
[54:18.57]God, this thing just does not blow up.
[54:22.93]I'm here, Glabagorp.
[54:24.81]Heal's down.
[54:27.53]Hold on.
[54:28.71]My mouse isn't working anymore because it gave me an achievement.
[54:32.51]Okay, I'm good.
[54:34.05]Ooh, this actually works pretty well.
[54:35.71]This goes far.
[54:36.09]Yeah, I think it also heals your NPC boys, too.
[54:39.13]They were all dead before.
[54:40.38]That is a far range.
[54:42.82]Yeah, I get five of those.
[54:44.96]What?
[54:45.40]Oh, my God.
[54:45.98]We're going to beat this for sure.
[54:47.90]Yeah, I have really good stuff for the boss, too.
[54:51.84]Oh, I just realized something.
[54:52.69]There's damage numbers on the gun.
[54:55.43]Yeah, you can put them on the characters or you can put them where you want them.
[54:59.95]Got it.
[55:00.27]Nice.
[55:01.77]Oh.
[55:10.53]I'm going to use my electromagnetic shaft very soon.
[55:14.17]I think this is where we got killed last time.
[55:15.81]We got the big juice shooter.
[55:18.41]I got to go get all the loot.
[55:19.95]Wait, there's a lot of green stuff everywhere.
[55:23.31]Hold on.
[55:24.07]Yeah.
[55:25.98]Yeah, the red is as important because the red is permanent health.
[55:30.00]It's armor, but it's health.
[55:32.06]Wait, what's the green one?
[55:34.04]Loot, right?
[55:34.48]Wait, the one's red.
[55:36.12]Health.
[55:39.62]Yeah, but it says armor.
[55:40.52]Why do you keep saying health?
[55:42.86]Right.
[55:43.28]That's a good question.
[55:45.58]That's a good question because a lot of people play this game and they go, wait, armor, health, is it my arm?
[55:50.89]That's a good question.
[55:51.53]Alright, wait, let's lock in because here it comes.
[55:54.29]So do you think I'm one of them?
[55:55.91]Are we doing locking on?
[55:57.37]Yeah, we are locking in on that big bug.
[56:01.81]Whenever that big bug shows up.
[56:03.95]As soon as it happens, I got this.
[56:05.59]We got this.
[56:06.73]Alright.
[56:12.29]I would love to shoot one of these over there while they're not here yet.
[56:14.41]That would be great.
[56:16.07]You know what?
[56:16.41]I'm going to shoot one.
[56:17.07]It's going to be hard.
[56:19.95]Oh!
[56:22.77]Saturday, Pili, back up.
[56:24.21]Heal.
[56:24.79]Okay.
[56:26.09]I almost hit the ground.
[56:26.87]It almost killed me.
[56:28.67]So I might have killed myself with my own air tortoise rocket.
[56:32.86]We're about to die then.
[56:34.66]We are.
[56:35.82]Oh, shit.
[56:37.48]Okay.
[56:38.18]Okay.
[56:38.52]We're getting kind of overwhelmed, but it's alright.
[56:42.77]Oh, my goodness.
[56:45.41]Oh, I'm dead.
[56:46.79]Okay, how did this one go worse?
[56:48.85]We're in panic mode.
[56:49.71]Don't worry.
[56:52.57]I'm in the skies.
[56:55.57]I'll res and go around.
[56:57.57]Okay.
[56:58.52]The volume of monsters is way lower than it was last time, though, at this point.
[57:05.40]I don't know about that.
[57:07.24]Didn't we have, like, trucks helping us last time?
[57:09.64]Oh, yeah, where are the trucks?
[57:10.54]I think that's what they're coming up, like, right now.
[57:15.21]I'm here, Jerry.
[57:18.42]Oh, thank you.
[57:19.88]Ah, right in front of the healer.
[57:21.26]My mouse died.
[57:22.18]Your mouse is dead?
[57:22.90]Oh, no.
[57:23.86]No, it was an achievement.
[57:25.34]Yeah, you get an achievement and it locks your mouse out.
[57:28.36]That's an interesting choice.
[57:30.44]Can I get a res too, by the way?
[57:32.18]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[57:33.32]Okay.
[57:37.63]Got you.
[57:38.91]Yeah, so I noticed that when I throw the healing down, it heals the enemies too if they come to it.
[57:46.16]You said I took the comedy weapon?
[57:47.96]I mean, that thing is disgusting if you can get it to hit me.
[57:50.50]Yeah, we got the other way.
[57:51.50]And we both did comedy weapon, which is a little bit eh.
[57:55.52]But it actually might help because we actually can kill this thing.
[57:58.06]We got to get ready.
[57:58.99]Group up.
[58:01.13]And I'm going to heal up.
[58:02.83]Okay.
[58:05.05]I'm headed to you, sir.
[58:13.95]Okay, here come the wheels.
[58:15.33]Okay, I think this is the big one.
[58:16.90]Big one coming up.
[58:18.88]Durr, I am right near you.
[58:20.22]I could use the heal.
[58:21.86]Oh, there it is.
[58:22.34]Nice.
[58:22.78]I put it on the tanks.
[58:25.60]Okay.
[58:30.96]Alright, let's prepare.
[58:31.93]Just stay in this zone.
[58:32.79]Stay behind the tanks.
[58:33.65]And then when the big thing comes, focus all fire on big thing.
[58:36.25]Okay.
[58:37.93]Yes.
[58:39.37]Roger, brother.
[58:41.30]I'm locking in.
[58:41.62]Oh, and at the very end of the mission, Wing Diver, you can pick up crates before the mission ends, but you gotta, like, speedrun it.
[58:48.88]After all, this is dead.
[58:49.96]It's a lot of, like, kind of hopping around.
[58:53.36]It'll give you, like, 10 seconds, and then the mission ends.
[58:55.52]That was good.
[59:00.23]That was pretty clean.
[59:00.85]I think we're good.
[59:06.65]There it is.
[59:08.21]Yep.
[59:08.37]Alright.
[59:08.61]Lock on.
[59:10.69]Jerma, it's... Okay, got it.
[59:11.97]It just took a while to lock onto the right party.
[59:13.49]I got one shot from something.
[59:14.89]Oh no, it's the red thing.
[59:16.15]Oh god.
[59:19.56]I need a res!
[59:21.00]Come on, you motherfucker!
[59:23.78]Alright, mine went off.
[59:25.34]Mine went off too.
[59:26.26]Alright, let's go.
[59:26.96]Oh god.
[59:31.81]Gary?
[59:32.15]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[59:36.71]Oh, this is bad.
[59:37.55]There we go, got a couple hits.
[59:38.53]Got a couple hits.
[59:39.37]Get out of here.
[59:44.23]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[59:45.19]No, can I make it to the help?
[59:46.83]That red stuff is bad.
[59:50.29]Nope.
[59:52.51]Did you get out?
[59:53.01]It's kind of hard to choose to lock onto a... Oh, okay.
[59:57.15]As long as you got us.
[59:58.05]I am frying him.
[60:04.59]I heard it roar.
[60:07.87]I'm awfully scared.
[60:08.85]I think I'm healing it.
[60:10.81]By the way, everyone is asking, like, oh my god, they're getting destroyed.
[60:12.86]We are playing on hard.
[60:14.42]We want the better items.
[60:16.84]So we could play this on normal and be fine, but... I just got killed again.
[60:20.90]We're not bad.
[60:21.74]It's on hard.
[60:22.66]There's not a whole lot left.
[60:27.26]Look at all those fucking goodies in the middle.
[60:28.64]I'm going to run to get heals before I can res you.
[60:30.78]I think if I res you, you'll kill me.
[60:32.44]Oh, they're all chasing me, I think.
[60:37.58]They are after you, Poke.
[60:38.96]Oh, my God.
[60:46.79]It looks like the attention is on almost solely on Poke.
[60:50.81]No, I have like a whole horde.
[60:52.59]Do you?
[60:53.21]Yeah, Ster's got some jelly coming his way.
[60:56.16]The queen's on me.
[60:58.02]I'm just trying to keep it around this building.
[61:01.04]Actually, yeah, Poke, if you couldn't just kind of pick them off while the queen is distracted, this is perfect time to do it.
[61:13.44]I'm trying right now.
[61:16.88]I've got the main NPC guy helping.
[61:18.64]Holy shit!
[61:22.44]Defend our mother Earth from any alien attack.
[61:27.53]Hold control.
[61:28.79]Oh, I'm dead.
[61:35.01]I can't do it.
[61:37.09]I'm dead and I can do it.
[61:38.41]And my character looks like he's just chilling.
[61:42.05]I've been getting you up right now.
[61:43.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[61:44.52]EDF.
[61:46.40]EDF.
[61:51.13]You guys got this.
[61:51.83]Yeah, we're good.
[61:52.49]Hell yeah.
[61:52.83]We're good.
[61:54.49]For sure.
[61:55.75]I'll get a heal and then rez.
[61:58.89]I'll get whatever remainders there are.
[62:01.59]Okay, I'm coming back.
[62:04.85]I only got two ants over here.
[62:06.37]As we beat this one on hard, do you guys think we should do the next one on normal because we're going to get a bunch of shit for this?
[62:11.30]No.
[62:11.92]No?
[62:12.38]Okay.
[62:13.25]Well, we're going to have better stuff to do the next mission.
[62:15.19]Better hard.
[62:16.27]Exactly.
[62:16.75]Better hard.
[62:18.55]Like, why are you giving up now?
[62:21.49]You think your stream's boring because you're just looking at the dirt?
[62:23.71]Are you being self-conscious because you died?
[62:25.97]No.
[62:27.78]No, because we are soldiers, brave and strong.
[62:30.70]My stream's not even on.
[62:34.70]When I said I'm starting my stream, I went... Yeah, dude, what's new?
[62:38.10]I went, oh, I have my stream starting.
[62:39.18]I went, I went like, click.
[62:40.80]I made it with my mouth.
[62:41.84]And like, you thought I did it.
[62:44.54]Alright, pick up everything.
[62:45.42]How long do we have?
[62:47.46]How long do we have to pick up the loot?
[62:49.14]Like 10 seconds.
[62:54.83]Get everything.
[62:55.81]Nice.
[63:00.75]Nice, guys.
[63:01.43]Alright, take a look at this.
[63:03.23]We got a lot of shit.
[63:03.93]We got a lot of stuff.
[63:04.75]Wow.
[63:06.95]Loot get.
[63:09.03]First of all, your explosion.
[63:10.26]It's all for Air Raider.
[63:12.36]I don't know if we get the same ones.
[63:13.95]No, we get different.
[63:15.05]Everyone gets their own unique loot.
[63:16.47]Yeah, I got a bunch of wing diver stuff.
[63:19.67]This is where it opens up.
[63:20.81]That's an upgrade, right?
[63:22.07]Yep.
[63:23.49]And it'll tell you, it'll say what it upgraded.
[63:25.88]Sometimes it picks one thing, like rate of fire or capacity, or you can see what it turns into.
[63:32.88]Oh, that's really good.
[63:33.60]I just got a grenade that it's like seven seconds less recharge time.
[63:39.09]Oh, I want this sniper rifle.
[63:40.13]That's big.
[63:40.93]Yeah, that's big.
[63:41.71]That's a huge deal.
[63:46.76]round burst sniper rifle I think so I still can't call in a freaking vehicle dude oh this one's on the ground star means that it's maxed out on that slot I see I'm not using the air tortoise anymore so when the air tortoise upgrades I think it actually gets better
[64:10.86]Okay, so less time to lock on.
[64:13.76]I don't know.
[64:14.98]Maybe?
[64:15.90]What do the stars mean compared to level?
[64:20.34]Level is... Oh, that's it.
[64:23.14]I don't know.
[64:24.20]Okay, you know, it took me like 10 years to figure out the scaling in Dark Souls games.
[64:27.30]I don't know what that is.
[64:28.04]I think the star is the upgrades and the level is what level you have to be to use it because there's like level 40 items you wouldn't be able to use yet that you get in higher difficulty.
[64:36.02]This thing's amazing.
[64:36.74]I'm using this.
[64:37.16]Yeah, the stars are the upgrades.
[64:38.81]It says level 8 for the V-Tuber.
[64:40.39]I can't equip Goura.
[64:42.73]Goura.
[64:43.15]Yeah, there's like V-Tubers in this game, apparently.
[64:48.62]Long-range hand grenade?
[64:49.76]Oh, yeah.
[64:50.24]Blast radius.
[64:52.92]Okay, there's a lot of shit here now.
[64:55.24]Okay.
[64:56.20]This is where it really opens up.
[64:57.72]Oh, I got a lot of stuff.
[64:58.94]I already did my Twitch streamer YouTuber I'm talking during the gameplay and there can't be any dead air or I'm a failure.
[65:05.21]I already did that.
[65:05.93]You can't do that in front of me.
[65:07.11]Mm-hmm.
[65:16.06]I'll try the Flounder IV.
[65:17.72]That seems fun.
[65:21.83]Fires four shots at once.
[65:23.33]That's cool.
[65:24.23]The assault rifles are really good too.
[65:28.75]Honestly, I had a level 2 one I used for that mission that was amazing.
[65:31.93]Yeah.
[65:32.38]So good.
[65:36.85]No, I fuck with the graphics.
[65:37.89]Reminds me of Guns Online.
[65:39.35]I think I'm going to play Fencer until they let me use a damn vehicle.
[65:43.39]I kind of want to try this.
[65:45.91]No, no, no, no.
[65:47.41]This grenade launcher is crazy right now.
[65:49.83]It's really good.
[65:50.55]I'm trying this gun rapid mirage.
[65:57.61]You're going to get equipment too.
[66:00.09]Depth crawler stinks.
[66:01.37]I think I'm good.
[66:06.21]Somebody said, I like how the menus get less legible every game.
[66:09.35]Yeah, they kind of do.
[66:11.79]Yeah, how does the UI like get worse every time?
[66:16.73]Probably the fork rocket launcher.
[66:18.15]Okay, why not?
[66:20.09]I love this game.
[66:21.47]It's so perfect.
[66:29.72]Okay.
[66:30.16]15 small missiles with good guidance system at once.
[66:33.42]Oh, I got P. Up.
[66:36.39]just letting you guys know I'm peeing in a bottle under the desk like right now yeah like in your pants oh he's got to clean up he can't talk while he pees it's it's a weakness of his it's like you can't rub your stomach can you do it how to pee no I can't do it can you can you pee and like like stare into my eyes and talk to me
[67:00.56]I can't do that.
[67:01.38]I can't do that.
[67:02.34]I only do that at a urinal with strangers.
[67:04.84]I'm sorry to say.
[67:05.88]If you're peeing in a toilet and I'm sitting on the top tank looking at you.
[67:10.58]Well, you're standing on the tank.
[67:12.86]What are you doing on the tank?
[67:13.86]No, no, like sitting on it.
[67:14.90]I'm sitting on it, facing you, and you're peeing in the toilet.
[67:19.90]Wait, so you're sitting up higher with your legs over the edges, kind of.
[67:25.16]And then... Yeah.
[67:26.22]Yeah.
[67:28.16]So you're using it like a throne, but not actually sitting in the seat.
[67:33.28]I'm sitting on the seat tier two.
[67:36.12]Okay.
[67:37.62]And you're saying you want me to come in here and take an upper decker in there?
[67:39.76]That's what you're trying to ask me to do.
[67:41.02]I was going to ask if that was part of this equation.
[67:44.24]Okay, so I guess I could be doing an upper decker and you're peeing.
[67:47.32]Can you look at me in the eyes and talk to me?
[67:51.49]While you're doing an upper decker, I'm supposed to pee in this toilet.
[67:54.31]Is that what you're... That's the question you're asking right now.
[67:56.61]Yes, and can you look at me in the eye and talk to me while this is happening?
[68:00.31]This is not a Monday question.
[68:01.97]This is like a Sunday afternoon question.
[68:04.99]Yeah, Monday... I'll wait till the weekend.
[68:08.25]I'll ask you again.
[68:09.04]This isn't a Saturday question.
[68:11.20]I was wondering because if I come visit you again, you know?
[68:13.24]Yeah.
[68:13.90]What were you saying, Vinny?
[68:15.76]Well, I got a better thing for, um, Monday.
[68:18.26]You ready?
[68:18.62]So, uh, what did the caveman order at the diner?
[68:21.51]Um, he smashed the person's head in with a club.
[68:26.91]Close, Jerma.
[68:27.71]That's really weird that you got so close.
[68:29.55]But, uh, club sandwich.
[68:33.30]Like, you almost got that joke perfectly, dude.
[68:36.97]It's Polk laughed.
[68:38.68]That's a good one.
[68:40.96]He liked it.
[68:41.42]I used to have a book.
[68:44.04]Any of you guys ever have that book that you kept in the bathroom and it was like 2001 jokes to tell?
[68:53.37]I had the rubber chicken book.
[68:54.93]It came with a rubber chicken.
[68:56.47]Is that close?
[68:58.51]My white friends in high school had that in their house.
[69:01.81]So I don't know.
[69:03.42]Yeah, I have the Declaration of Independence in front of my toilet so I can learn it.
[69:06.90]Alright, I got a new weapon.
[69:09.58]How much can you recite?
[69:11.32]Yeah.
[69:13.46]Alright, let's move.
[69:14.25]Oh, my new gun's crazy.
[69:15.09]Yeah, by the way, I think they were eggs.
[69:22.97]That was an egg.
[69:24.11]Yeah, this mission is called Cracking a Few Eggs if you get my drift.
[69:30.85]I just want to throw a drink in his face again.
[69:33.43]Yeah.
[69:34.43]Olympic guns are so fucking bad.
[69:36.50]The friendship is rot.
[69:37.58]Yeah, break the eggs and whatever comes out, shoot it.
[69:45.98]This thing's actually pretty good.
[69:47.88]This new assault rifle, this M1 Raven.
[69:53.49]The range on this grenade launcher is unbelievable.
[69:57.81]I almost can't believe it.
[70:01.93]Well, you better believe it.
[70:04.50]I don't, this is, this is weird.
[70:06.52]You break the eggs and they're like born early and they're still just as strong.
[70:10.14]Like, are they late bloomers or?
[70:12.84]They might be like kind of just coming out now.
[70:15.44]Maybe that's how they're sent here.
[70:18.21]Maybe they were in the egg.
[70:19.79]Right, yep.
[70:21.45]They could have dropped off like a thousand million of those.
[70:25.57]Yeah, and the egg just like survives the atmosphere, but then it's after that, it's like, no.
[70:31.03]I'm helpless.
[70:32.99]It's helpless.
[70:34.27]I'm helpless.
[70:37.43]Takes two full clips to kill one ant.
[70:41.55]Hey, but you're a late bloomer.
[70:43.39]You're going to end up getting an orbital strike that will kill every single enemy in five seconds.
[70:47.43]Yeah, like mission 50 when they finally decide that I'm like, they're scared of me.
[70:52.78]Are you willing to put the time in to get an air raider that's got all the cool shit?
[70:56.94]Up to you.
[70:57.96]It does take me forever to kill a goddamn ant.
[71:01.52]That's a hard mode for you.
[71:02.50]I don't know if you know, but this game gets pretty hard.
[71:04.04]In real life, it's one stomp.
[71:06.25]This makes no sense.
[71:07.97]Where's the realism?
[71:09.49]That one looks just like us.
[71:11.55]It's one shoe in real life.
[71:12.65]This is so weird.
[71:14.77]A grown-ass man ant.
[71:17.17]I remember that grown-ass man bit.
[71:18.69]I like that bit.
[71:19.75]That's a great bit.
[71:20.55]I like it a lot.
[71:22.25]It's a pretty quality bit.
[71:24.69]I saw an ant the other day trying to pull the leg off of a live spotted lanternfly.
[71:31.50]And it just kept trying, and the spotted lanternfly just kept jumping slightly out of the way, and the ant would go back to it and try to rip its leg off more.
[71:38.51]Dude, this grenade is fucking unbelievable.
[71:40.25]I'm not laughing at that, by the way.
[71:41.51]I'm laughing at how crazy this grenade is.
[71:43.85]Oh, okay.
[71:44.25]Yeah, he's not even listening to you.
[71:46.05]Dude, that's fucked up.
[71:47.05]I have a chat that's listening.
[71:48.19]They're very kind to me.
[71:51.15]I heard it.
[71:51.43]You talked about this fucking morbid scene that you had to watch.
[71:55.03]Yeah, I had to watch it, Jerma.
[71:56.63]Like, I couldn't look away.
[72:01.14]Man, you guys are funny.
[72:07.64]I like when Poke does the Poke voice.
[72:10.49]What voice?
[72:11.39]Dude, speaking of voices, that game where you have to match the voices, what the fuck is that?
[72:16.59]I was peeing and I was going to say that.
[72:18.25]I was going to tell Vinny that, but I forgot.
[72:19.53]Vinny, I just stole that game.
[72:21.94]You did?
[72:22.42]You played it, Poke?
[72:23.42]I loved it.
[72:24.24]Amazing.
[72:25.44]So, I can explain.
[72:27.56]It was an old Mario Party 3DS minigame, where you just had Mario voices, and you would just match the waveform.
[72:37.03]So I did that years ago, and those clips are always really weirdly big for me, so I commissioned someone.
[72:44.59]I was like, hey, does anyone in chat want to make a game?
[72:47.88]And this dude spent, you know, months making Choicer Voicer.
[72:52.46]And you just have to match the waveform of clips.
[72:54.80]And it's amazing.
[72:56.60]Wait, that's sick.
[72:58.42]That's awesome, though.
[72:59.16]It's really fun.
[72:59.68]You commissioned?
[73:00.44]I just asked them to make it.
[73:01.44]They didn't do it.
[73:02.04]So, oh, my God.
[73:03.46]Yeah, you got to pay.
[73:04.36]But, yeah, I think the dude that made it just before you play it, Jerma, he wants to, like, fix it up a little bit more.
[73:10.95]Because, you know, once you play it, like, a lot of people are going to know about it.
[73:16.29]So...
[73:17.95]If you want, I can, like, DM you when he's ready.
[73:20.39]Yeah, no, I just saw you play, and then I saw Poke play, and I was like, that looks really cool.
[73:24.40]I thought it was great right now.
[73:25.24]I thought it was almost ready.
[73:26.02]It's close, yeah.
[73:27.60]I think it's real close.
[73:28.72]He's doing a great job.
[73:30.12]I am in trouble.
[73:31.70]I need help.
[73:32.18]Do you have any of those heals, sir?
[73:35.40]Uh, I do.
[73:37.09]I'm currently in the spider.
[73:38.37]Oh, you're inside of the unit.
[73:42.13]It's not great.
[73:42.91]Uh, this health here, I think I'm pretty alright.
[73:47.77]This is a very great game to just, like, play.
[73:50.12]Yeah.
[73:52.22]Yes, I agree.
[73:54.82]I like it.
[74:02.67]Is there, like, a detailed story?
[74:04.65]Like, I know they showed a little cutscene, but is there, like, a lot of story, Jerma?
[74:07.99]Or is it just in store?
[74:09.21]Um...
[74:12.54]Not really.
[74:14.74]You saved the Earth, and these are the remnants of we saved Earth last game, and we're doing cleanup at this point.
[74:24.57]I feel like every EDF game is you have to save the Earth, and this is the first time you're like, dude, what if Axe... Oh, no!
[74:29.99]Last game was Earth 2.
[74:31.67]Oh, yeah.
[74:34.87]My bad.
[74:35.39]Oh, I'm down.
[74:36.23]Yeah.
[74:37.40]like super Earth you yeah but different you've saved Earth so many times now you have to save Earth too right in the head so this is the remnant of Earth too I'm coming to save y'all help
[75:05.48]They all don't want to die.
[75:06.88]That was also part of the plot.
[75:08.20]I'm going to pick these up.
[75:19.43]This thing doesn't actually heal all that much.
[75:22.17]It is pretty consistent, though.
[75:24.93]Yeah, I mean, it'll stay up for a long time.
[75:28.43]Purple blood is very aesthetically pleasing.
[75:31.09]We got to get rid of these.
[75:38.34]Dude, we got a freaking horde.
[75:41.50]Uh... They are coming.
[75:43.74]Hey, see that guy in the top of the building up there?
[75:46.63]Oh, never mind.
[75:47.03]We'll watch his friend.
[75:48.85]How'd that egg get stuck in the building like that?
[75:50.61]That's crazy.
[75:51.01]There's an egg on the roof!
[75:53.95]Oh, gotta destroy the building.
[75:54.95]Do you guys see my ping?
[75:55.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[75:57.59]Attack the egg over there!
[75:58.57]It's okay.
[76:00.69]There you go.
[76:01.53]With pleasure.
[76:05.35]Oh, they're coming down the main road.
[76:11.67]Wow, that grenade's really good, but it just kills me.
[76:18.39]Ster, you want to go in there and start slaying some monsters?
[76:22.28]I am.
[76:23.08]With pleasure.
[76:23.78]What is wrong with you?
[76:30.48]Oh, Jerma, my chat wanted me to tell you earlier, I'm finally watching The Simpsons proper for the first time.
[76:35.77]Oh, really?
[76:36.87]You know they're in New Jersey?
[76:39.14]There is a Springfield in New Jersey.
[76:40.50]It's North Jersey.
[76:41.94]That's right.
[76:45.24]What's behind us?
[76:45.90]There's a bug just sitting there behind us.
[76:50.80]Yeah, watch the little bugs that are just on the corners and just hanging out.
[76:53.38]Just firing at us.
[76:54.84]They hide like a rocket launcher.
[76:56.86]Those less than one shot of your sniper.
[76:59.06]Oh.
[77:00.84]Oh Vinny, I'm going to try.
[77:04.48]Thanks Jerry.
[77:10.19]What's the blast?
[77:11.43]What just happened?
[77:20.18]I don't know what I just did to myself.
[77:22.46]This guy won't die.
[77:25.08]Yeah, this guy's a boss.
[77:28.46]I think I'm stuck in like a... Not a lot of health.
[77:31.58]Not a lot of health.
[77:32.22]Oh, thank you.
[77:33.30]This new gun is not it.
[77:37.85]Oh, God, I zoomed in while running.
[77:39.99]It's jank.
[77:40.98]Whoever told me to get this gun mod, just go ahead and ban them.
[77:43.42]Send them a warning.
[77:45.90]Oh, come on.
[77:48.66]Oh, man.
[77:51.72]Where the fuck are you?
[77:52.48]I'm going to come res you.
[77:56.61]Thanks.
[77:59.45]Oh, the guy's kind of running low on heals.
[78:01.51]Look at this drive-by res.
[78:03.39]Nice.
[78:04.31]I missed.
[78:05.11]What are you doing?
[78:10.25]Thanks, man.
[78:10.73]Take their legs out.
[78:11.49]You can knock their legs off and they'll fall.
[78:13.95]They regen, but if you knock them down on the ground, they can't move.
[78:23.10]Right in the head.
[78:29.98]That grenade is so hard to hit anything with.
[78:35.93]We're in not bad shape.
[78:42.23]These, uh, the DNG-1, Vinny, by the way, is amazing.
[78:45.87]If you end up getting it.
[78:46.97]The grenade.
[78:48.63]Okay.
[78:50.58]Is it the one where you throw with great force?
[78:52.62]Yeah.
[78:53.38]I'm using it.
[78:54.58]Oh, yeah.
[78:54.96]That thing is amazing.
[78:55.88]Oh, good.
[78:56.18]I killed myself with it twice.
[78:57.94]It was so good.
[78:59.30]Wait, does each class get different guns?
[79:00.92]Like, we don't... Do we get the same gun?
[79:02.32]Oh, wow.
[79:05.60]Alright.
[79:08.38]Looking good.
[79:18.48]I did not want to shoot that.
[79:19.48]Oh, please don't kill me.
[79:24.23]I feel like they're they're about to.
[79:27.07]You know apps on us.
[79:30.11]Or the mission might be over here.
[79:31.89]It might be, but I'm worried about if there's an extra big bug.
[79:36.42]We'll handle it.
[79:36.94]I don't know guys.
[79:46.29]One more.
[79:47.67]Before we kill the last bug, do we have all the stuff?
[79:50.91]No.
[79:51.21]Oh.
[79:52.55]Oh, yeah.
[79:54.13]Well, there's some green.
[79:56.23]We got it.
[79:58.11]Just heals there.
[79:58.99]At last, peace and quiet.
[80:05.33]This city really is beautiful.
[80:06.79]Yahoo!
[80:09.51]Earth is saved.
[80:12.45]Alright, I think I'm gonna replace this.
[80:13.57]For now.
[80:14.89]I'm liking it all.
[80:15.73]No!
[80:16.47]I missed the weapon upgrade!
[80:19.13]Sorry, we got a lot.
[80:20.32]We got some good shit here.
[80:22.24]Oh yeah, I got some cool stuff.
[80:23.72]Ooh, Thunder Crossbow Destroyer Blaster?
[80:27.56]Napalm?
[80:28.24]What the?
[80:29.98]Okay.
[80:30.22]What the?
[80:31.24]There's a Napalm?
[80:34.51]Yeah, that's banned in the Geneva Convention.
[80:36.41]Slugger bullets.
[80:37.45]This thing is gonna be awesome.
[80:40.75]I get it now, Jerma.
[80:46.70]Good shit.
[80:49.02]You just have to upgrade everything and you have to upgrade every weapon and you have to get every weapon and you have to beat every mission on the hard difficulty and you have to collect everything.
[80:55.82]That's it.
[80:56.66]Alright.
[80:59.57]Holy shit, this does a lot of damage.
[81:02.73]563 as a spread with whatever that means.
[81:11.69]Yeah, freak this.
[81:18.07]I might just go Thunder Crossbow.
[81:21.19]The game is just kind of bad.
[81:24.87]One of the better wing diver pieces of equipment, I think the plasma bombs, like the plasma grenade things that you get where you kind of be like... Oh, like... Yeah.
[81:39.38]Or no, the other one.
[81:40.70]The other one.
[81:42.00]Okay.
[81:49.47]Try the firecracker.
[81:50.38]I'll try the napalm.
[81:53.68]Tanks, helicopters, bikes.
[81:55.18]I can't wait to unlock that stuff.
[81:56.68]The bike is so goofy.
[81:57.78]It's like the hardest thing to use in the whole game, but it's so funny.
[82:02.43]Wait, some guns only shoot once.
[82:05.53]Yes.
[82:07.41]The whole round?
[82:09.97]I believe so.
[82:11.03]That may be like the nuke.
[82:13.50]I don't know.
[82:14.06]Yeah, you can shoot it once, but it probably has like a pretty long reload.
[82:19.86]Oh, okay.
[82:26.91]Yeah, you know in Red Dead 2, when you ride around on the horse and it kind of feels like sometimes you just get dumped?
[82:33.63]If you've run into like a Little Rock?
[82:35.93]Yeah.
[82:36.57]No.
[82:37.65]The motorcycle in this game is, if you don't, if you're not perfectly upright, you just fly off of it.
[82:44.06]So if you do any weird hard turns, you're going to go off.
[82:48.26]It's very funny.
[82:49.93]I'm gonna be so bad at that, but my chat's gonna love every second.
[82:54.13]We all get one?
[82:56.07]Uh, you do not.
[82:58.86]Oh.
[82:59.14]Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[83:00.24]Have you tried running over a bug?
[83:04.58]Uh, I think you can.
[83:08.08]This thing is... I like this thing a lot.
[83:11.94]I equipped the wrong thing.
[83:16.28]Whoa, that's a weird gun.
[83:20.12]Alright, hold on guys.
[83:22.39]You want to stop?
[83:23.27]OK.
[83:25.61]That's gonna goof me right up.
[83:27.93]What was wrong with it?
[83:28.57]What would you do?
[83:29.77]I pick Spencer, but I didn't have like, it's a whole thing.
[83:36.26]I love the tagline for this one.
[83:37.72]Good news, you've got an easy job today.
[83:39.50]Go help out the extermination team.
[83:43.26]Is it?
[83:44.18]Vinny, up your armor?
[83:45.75]Explain, what do you mean up your armor?
[83:50.43]uh oh maximum okay I see yeah you can like kind of nerf yourself I think if you maybe if you're playing with other people that and don't you know if you're like I only have 200 health and you have a thousand it's like well I'm kind of I'll level myself down I understand cool alright pick a better launcher ah it's too late now chat I shoot multiple purple
[84:16.89]I'm hoping multiple purple is good.
[84:19.40]I need to up my Riz.
[84:21.52]I don't think I have to do that.
[84:23.40]You do.
[84:30.60]Have you heard the new slang, Jerma?
[84:32.22]Like, Ohio is a slang word now?
[84:36.32]Really?
[84:37.96]Yeah, there's two new slang words in the world.
[84:39.82]There's Ohio and Northernlion.
[84:44.37]Northernlion's a slang word.
[84:46.61]Yeah, he's like Riz, Skibidi, that kind of thing.
[84:49.45]Really?
[84:49.77]Mm-hmm.
[84:54.01]I'm playing Sunder.
[84:55.93]That makes sense to me.
[84:56.90]I get it.
[84:57.36]Yeah, me too.
[84:57.94]Am I going to kind of complain or try to fight against that?
[85:02.74]That makes complete and total absolute sense to me.
[85:05.72]Is it true you get sued for saying Skibidi now?
[85:08.50]What?
[85:09.16]Yeah, you can't even think about Skibidi.
[85:11.55]Oh, crap.
[85:12.70]I know.
[85:13.10]I think about it a lot, too.
[85:14.52]Especially when I go to my PO box and people have given me Skibidi Toys chat.
[85:18.52]Which one of you?
[85:23.49]Wait, the numbers under the target is a good change.
[85:27.47]I hope that doesn't come down.
[85:28.61]Oh, shit.
[85:32.10]Oh, shit.
[85:33.18]Oh, shit.
[85:34.94]Shit.
[85:36.69]It's still there.
[85:38.55]Oh no, I think I just blew you up.
[85:40.14]Yeah, I also might be.
[85:42.58]I might have hurt someone.
[85:44.04]I don't know how much friendly fire this is doing.
[85:46.06]Yeah, some of these launchers are kind of hard to like not hit your friends.
[85:53.70]As long as we stay out of the middle.
[85:55.92]I think I just heard the explosion.
[85:58.67]There it is.
[85:59.17]OK, I'm good.
[85:59.75]I'm safe to go back over there.
[86:08.78]Yeah, somebody who is dropping like the explosion.
[86:12.32]Oh, you see mine there?
[86:13.88]They're killing everything.
[86:14.90]It's great.
[86:16.12]It's playing the rat movie explosion sound effect.
[86:26.27]Yes, it is.
[86:29.17]That is default sound pack volume.
[86:32.95]God, I don't know.
[86:33.51]What do you think like Vinny?
[86:34.39]What like what like sound pack is this from?
[86:38.28]Like the default explosion sound.
[86:41.22]Concrete collection.
[86:42.47]Yep.
[86:43.55]So it's like, you know, they have gold, emerald, jade.
[86:45.85]So it's like sound effects, concrete.
[86:51.88]Alright, and... That's an abstract answer.
[86:55.70]I see.
[86:56.54]That was actually a pretty good answer for what we were talking about.
[86:58.86]I'm fencering.
[87:00.44]You are fencering.
[87:02.30]I get it now.
[87:03.70]When you switch weapons, it resets your dash.
[87:06.28]So you can double jump and then dash.
[87:08.94]And yeah, the hammer is really sick.
[87:19.96]Alright, we're almost done with the tutorial.
[87:22.63]cool well at least there's music in this tutorial the first tutorial there was no music it was just talking it's such a weird tutorial it just is it really is because they do this I I did a spencer first and you slow walk down the hallways I was like I have to get off fencer but I didn't realize it made it everybody has to just slowly follow the instructor yeah what was up with that
[87:52.64]pretty, it was pretty crazy.
[87:57.89]As long as we like, just nobody go into the, like into the depths of the bug kind of, you know.
[88:03.59]I'll just hit you guys.
[88:04.21]Okay.
[88:05.01]We're good?
[88:06.70]As long as you're killing at least four or five of them when you do that, it's all, you can hit, you can hit me.
[88:11.94]Thank you.
[88:21.37]Chad, this launcher is good.
[88:22.79]It's just hard to aim.
[88:24.05]You can't really hit anything intentionally.
[88:27.59]Good luck.
[88:30.37]I need some health here.
[88:31.52]Oh, we got another wave coming in.
[88:34.46]Jerma, I'm at health right now if you want some.
[88:36.78]There's like a couple.
[88:38.14]Come to me.
[88:39.32]I'm stuck.
[88:39.60]I got a couple.
[88:40.80]Okay, you got some.
[88:41.46]I think I'm alright.
[88:42.32]Yeah, it's kind of everywhere right now.
[88:44.80]We got a lot of things killed, so we're doing okay.
[88:47.02]I have like 40 second reload times.
[88:51.22]On what?
[88:51.93]On my hammer.
[88:55.95]How does that work?
[88:58.37]Is it rocket propelled?
[88:59.35]Yeah.
[89:01.21]Alright.
[89:01.77]Yeah.
[89:01.93]Well, then that's obvious.
[89:04.15]Well, obviously.
[89:05.63]It's obvious.
[89:08.74]Alright.
[89:09.28]Next wave.
[89:18.78]There it is.
[89:27.03]Spray and pray.
[89:35.87]I like this slugger.
[89:36.79]I don't actually know what my shield does.
[89:39.67]I think if you just hold it up, it blocks damage, doesn't it?
[89:45.31]I think you can reload your shield too.
[89:47.63]It's a weird button combo.
[89:48.69]I think it's like Z or something.
[90:00.17]Firecracker grenade's cool, and it respawns instantly.
[90:03.23]I like it a lot.
[90:06.69]What's your slugger, Jerma?
[90:07.73]Is that a shotgun?
[90:08.23]It's like a plasma shotgun that shoots a big ball out, and it has a bunch of radius around it.
[90:14.47]Oh, Jerma, did you play Armored Core?
[90:16.37]I did.
[90:16.69]For a little bit.
[90:19.13]I liked it, but I didn't like it enough to continue playing it past the third of the way through it, maybe, I want to say.
[90:24.95]I also kind of burned out on it, but I did like everything I played.
[90:29.22]I powered through it and I thought it was great, but it took me like a couple missions to really like kind of fall into it.
[90:36.20]But yeah, it's awesome.
[90:38.18]I think one day I'll probably go back and play it.
[90:46.91]I didn't play it.
[90:47.53]We got a lot of stuff to get.
[90:50.67]Hulk, what are you streaming at the moment?
[90:51.97]Like what's your like thing that you're doing?
[90:54.44]Dark and Darker.
[90:56.56]Did you play Dungeonborn?
[90:58.78]yeah I don't like it at all so what I I haven't played Dark and Darker in a while what's what's worse about dungeon board if you don't mind me asking I don't know it just feels like timu like yeah it has some things that are better you know but I don't know it's just it ain't Dark and Darker fair enough oak do you know that what I own do you know what I have in my possession what
[91:23.81]I have a signed poster from the lead dev of Dark and Darker, of a Dark and Darker poster.
[91:30.87]Wow.
[91:32.23]And it is on display above my mantle.
[91:38.95]SDF?
[91:40.41]SDF.
[91:42.25]Wait, that's sick.
[91:43.75]Something doing fast.
[91:48.17]Have you been playing Dark and Darker?
[91:49.31]Yeah.
[91:51.28]Oh shit, I might have killed you.
[91:53.10]You probably have, yeah.
[91:56.42]Not as much as I would like to, but yeah, I've been playing it.
[91:58.76]I'm learning my kicking buttons.
[92:00.76]No, I'm not flexing.
[92:01.84]I just, he likes the game and he might think that's like kind of cool.
[92:05.12]I felt a little weird about it, but.
[92:06.52]Oh, did you?
[92:07.16]Shit.
[92:08.61]Okay, um, guys, the one guy that told me to tell him about your poster so he'll like you more.
[92:13.81]Ban him for a week.
[92:16.61]No, you can send warnings now.
[92:20.05]You can send a warning.
[92:20.85]Oh, you can send a warning.
[92:28.04]Mods warn him.
[92:28.82]I'm so far away from you guys.
[92:33.02]Look at how far away I am.
[92:37.11]Am I heel hogging?
[92:41.07]That's my job, Poke.
[92:42.01]Don't worry about it.
[92:42.75]It actually is better.
[92:44.37]Like, honestly, if you're getting a lot of health and keeping yourself topped off, that's actually a good thing because you're the mobile one.
[92:50.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[92:51.82]It's a very good thing.
[92:52.66]You do have full health.
[92:56.79]Poke, you're like our savior.
[92:58.61]Like, that's why you have like an angel.
[93:02.61]I'm watching from above.
[93:03.99]Yep.
[93:09.57]I think I just killed the office building.
[93:11.43]I was about it.
[93:16.01]This is not very accurate at long range, is it?
[93:28.22]Just gonna be artillery.
[93:30.50]Just gonna hang out and reload.
[93:32.12]I'm gonna take this building over here.
[93:37.82]I'm not.
[93:42.12]Probably didn't need that help.
[93:43.19]Sorry.
[93:52.35]You okay, Pogue?
[93:54.11]Yeah, I'm just saying.
[93:56.36]I see you stuck in a wall.
[93:57.78]Oh, oh!
[93:58.44]Oh no, I think you're bugged.
[93:59.24]Yeah, I was bugged.
[94:00.32]The game is a notorious problem with online right now, apparently.
[94:04.96]Where it's going to desync you sometimes, and you're going to be flying around shooting at a building and shooting in the air, and you're actually not.
[94:12.41]You're fighting over here with us.
[94:15.19]He was just stuck in a doorway.
[94:17.65]But I see him now.
[94:18.43]He moved.
[94:20.77]That is pretty notorious.
[94:23.71]The forums are ablaze.
[94:25.45]Yeah.
[94:28.45]Can we do it?
[94:33.27]I feel like this is like a slightly anticlimactic ending to the mission.
[94:37.07]So we should all sing.
[94:37.85]I agree.
[94:39.37]What bog is this by?
[94:49.74]OK, good.
[94:54.97]Who just created like a bunch of me?
[94:57.21]That's my hammer.
[94:58.63]That's what that does.
[94:59.87]Yeah.
[95:01.09]Oh, good job.
[95:03.07]You could have played this character, but you didn't like it.
[95:06.17]No.
[95:08.83]But you're like, that's foolish now.
[95:10.45]Yes.
[95:10.81]It was fucked up.

[108:18.08]It really got me into it.
[108:20.44]Yeah, but it's the part where it really got me back into reading the lore of the vault.
[108:27.07]Have you heard him say, like, for real?
[108:30.01]Like, for real.
[108:34.75]Oh, it's just so funny.
[108:36.61]I love it.
[108:45.26]Yeah, I think we all picked the anti-air weapons.
[108:48.16]I am literally using the lowest range weapons I could have chosen, almost.
[108:54.64]So I'm just going to not contribute a whole lot if that's alright, guys.
[108:58.05]I'll heal when needed.
[108:59.09]I'll do that much.
[109:02.51]My chat was like, Vinny, why are you choosing a shotgun?
[109:04.47]I'm like, no, I got this.
[109:07.83]These homing missiles sure are not homing on anything.
[109:11.51]Skeet shooting is all shotguns.
[109:14.50]Did you ever go skeet surfing?
[109:18.12]What?
[109:18.96]No.
[109:19.10]Skeet surfing.
[109:20.24]You skeet shoot while you're surfing.
[109:23.14]Sounds dangerous.
[109:24.74]Yeah, it's pretty dangerous.
[109:30.35]Shotguns are good.
[109:31.27]Yeah, shotguns are... Actually, I love shotguns in EDF.
[109:39.11]Oh, they have, like, hives.
[109:40.33]Yeah, look, we have to kill the nest.
[109:41.92]Oh.
[109:45.14]Whoa, these nests are gross.
[109:50.47]I'm gonna dildo it.
[109:55.77]It's gooing!
[109:57.43]That's disgusting, dude.
[110:00.43]Wait, I'm in the hole.
[110:02.07]Oh, shit.
[110:02.59]Okay.
[110:03.33]Never mind.
[110:10.10]Where is he?
[110:11.99]They even make a weird noise, too.
[110:13.31]They go like... They kind of sound like weird computer parts.
[110:17.21]Sounded like a trumpet.
[110:24.48]Oh, Vinny, what have you been playing?
[110:27.48]No.
[110:30.96]Chat, what am I playing?
[110:31.70]Elden Ring?
[110:35.48]Yes, Elden Ring.
[110:36.30]I'm almost done with the thing.
[110:38.18]I finished Monkey Ball.
[110:39.34]That was fun.
[110:40.94]Cool.
[110:41.89]Playing EDF at the moment.
[110:46.37]And Poop Killer.
[110:48.43]There's a Poop Killer series.
[110:50.77]I'm familiar with Poop Killer.
[110:52.03]How many have you played, Ster?
[110:54.58]I haven't.
[110:55.32]I saw someone else play them.
[110:56.66]I think I saw six of them.
[110:58.26]I think I'm out of that.
[110:58.90]I saw the whole lineage.
[111:02.96]Apparently one of them is banned on Twitch, and I don't know which one it is, and I can't get good info about it.
[111:10.37]You're playing Get Banned Roulette then.
[111:12.91]Can anyone destroy this building they're behind?
[111:14.81]I think there's a nest.
[111:16.31]Yeah.
[111:16.71]This isn't like poop.
[111:23.68]You could watch it if you're in a hot tub while you play it.
[111:27.46]You're right.
[111:28.64]You are correct, yeah.
[111:30.06]What about Jacuzzi?
[111:31.50]Uh, that counts.
[111:36.85]Yeah, we gotta get rid of these buildings.
[111:38.89]And Ster, how about yourself?
[111:39.90]What are you playing lately?
[111:40.78]Uh, Path of Exile Offstream.
[111:48.02]Was there a new expansion?
[111:49.68]Yeah.
[111:50.60]Path of Exile was fun.
[111:54.03]I like it.
[111:55.71]Oh, two hives on me.
[111:56.59]I mean, you haven't played in two weeks.
[112:01.21]Kind of been ignoring the group chat.
[112:05.94]Uh, I didn't hear anything.
[112:06.98]It sounded like Wind kind of blew by.
[112:10.14]I didn't hear anything.
[112:10.80]Kind of like wind or something by my right ear.
[112:14.45]That was weird.
[112:17.09]I'm sorry.
[112:17.73]Did you say there was a group chat without me?
[112:22.55]He does this.
[112:22.99]He makes a group chat with everybody but one person so he can control the narrative.
[112:28.71]That is my go-to.
[112:32.13]Sir, I thought we were getting closer and we were going to play carnival games together.
[112:36.63]Oh my god.
[112:37.37]That's a lot.
[112:37.99]There's a lot over here.
[112:39.24]Wait, did we talk about playing carnival games?
[112:42.56]Bro, there's a clip with like 100,000 views on my channel about us playing carnival games.
[112:46.90]I know that we talked about playing diaper games, and I did legitimately look on Steam for diaper games we could play together, and I didn't find any.
[112:56.23]I died.
[112:57.41]We have to get rid of these nests.
[112:59.49]They're spawning a thousand at a time.
[113:02.55]Oh, shit.
[113:03.87]If anybody has a recommendation...
[113:07.18]I think we have to blow up the holes.
[113:10.00]Also, me and Poke were supposed to do VRChat a thousand times.
[113:13.90]It just hasn't happened.
[113:14.70]I'm sorry, Poke.
[113:17.08]It's okay.
[113:18.12]I'll take the blame for that one.
[113:20.06]No, I'm lazy as hell.
[113:21.70]Yeah, me too, buddy.
[113:24.31]Hey, all that matters is we're here right now playing EDF, hanging out, chilling.
[113:28.43]Look at us.
[113:30.27]Yeah, look at us.
[113:30.93]I mean, that is really all that matters.
[113:38.75]Can the dildo dozer go over here and hit this a few times?
[113:43.76]It's not the dildo dozer that makes it sound weird.
[113:48.04]Oh yeah, yeah, that one makes it sound weird, yeah.
[113:55.15]In the hole in the hole quick dildosers.
[113:59.67]Well, that's so that's oh.
[114:02.19]They're all just kind of coming out of it.
[114:03.69]It's so creepy.
[114:05.31]My whole screen is just goo.
[114:10.88]I need health.
[114:12.52]I've got a health grenade we can do.
[114:14.46]Wanna do it?
[114:14.90]Let's do it.
[114:15.28]I wanna see what it does.
[114:16.38]Actually, yeah.
[114:16.98]Okay, I'm coming over there.
[114:19.07]Yeah, let's... Come over to me.
[114:21.15]Everyone gather around and I'm gonna throw a grenade at us.
[114:25.79]I'm pretty sure it heals.
[114:27.31]You ready?
[114:28.65]I'm grouped.
[114:30.11]Alright, we're grouped up.
[114:31.76]Heal us.
[114:33.34]You get over closer to them, Jerm.
[114:35.90]I don't know the range on this thing.
[114:38.29]Uh, we might not be synced completely.
[114:40.19]There's a goo mist.
[114:41.65]Yeah, he's in the mist.
[114:42.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[114:44.58]That achievement shit that takes control away from you is actually, like, that needs to be patched.
[114:49.12]That's bad.
[114:50.06]No, don't change it.
[114:51.96]It wouldn't be EDF if they fixed it.
[114:55.65]Oh, yeah.
[114:58.01]What is that?
[114:58.61]There's, like, a firework show going on.
[115:00.53]Oh, that thing's awesome.
[115:04.13]I'm doing doing the 4th of July.
[115:06.27]Oh no, the the diver thing.
[115:08.47]Yeah, there things still healing.
[115:10.45]That is, yeah, it's still going.
[115:12.29]Is there a nest over here?
[115:19.80]There are nests everywhere.
[115:23.70]That's where they live.
[115:26.06]Someone alright, we split up into groups of two.
[115:27.78]Somebody come with me and then two of you go the other way.
[115:30.08]Because these nests gotta go others.
[115:31.86]There's like three down this way.
[115:34.15]I'm here.
[115:35.11]There's a couple here.
[115:35.79]There's like three here, yeah.
[115:40.33]Yeah, we got it, Ster.
[115:41.63]There we go.
[115:42.89]Oh, that's a lot coming out.
[115:44.86]It's not carnival games, but it'll do.
[115:46.36]I mean, how are we going to play carnival games?
[115:51.36]We have to hang out.
[115:52.64]You want to meet me at, um... Ow!
[115:55.57]Oh, that's a bad idea.
[115:56.85]Bad idea.
[115:57.31]I'm running.
[116:01.83]Oh!
[116:03.82]I'm going to get help.
[116:07.74]I abandoned ship there, Poke.
[116:08.94]Sorry.
[116:09.16]I had to run.
[116:18.60]I see you up there flying around.
[116:19.81]I'm trying my best.
[116:24.47]We got any more of those fucking heals?
[116:26.57]I think we're okay.
[116:27.83]I have heals if you need them.
[116:29.21]I got two more heal grenades.
[116:31.19]And then they're out.
[116:35.03]You ready, Ster?
[116:35.53]I'll go to you.
[116:37.89]Oh yeah, I gotta get this ant hive.
[116:46.14]Oh god.
[116:50.14]My suit has no power so I can barely fly.
[116:54.94]Ouch.
[116:58.59]I can get you in a second here.
[117:05.15]Alright, I'm coming for you.
[117:07.67]Dude, do the objective, you guys.
[117:09.73]We are... The hive detritus is huge.
[117:16.81]I got a bounty to do.
[117:17.77]Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
[117:22.42]Fly away.
[117:22.90]You weren't even near me.
[117:26.04]I can throw a grenade at you guys.
[117:28.04]I have one more heal left if you want.
[117:29.60]Oh, that would be scrumptious if you could throw it over here.
[117:32.66]Oh, where are you?
[117:33.82]We're all over this.
[117:35.72]Oh, boy.
[117:37.30]I'm looking for you.
[117:38.16]I see the poke is on the building.
[117:41.30]I'll get you.
[117:42.20]I'm coming.
[117:46.42]Thank you.
[117:46.74]I'm going to throw a grenade.
[117:47.60]Ready?
[117:48.02]Here we go.
[117:48.42]Right here.
[117:48.74]Right here.
[117:50.05]I'm coming up.
[117:50.63]There it is.
[117:51.01]Oh, yes.
[117:51.99]Oh, it's healing.
[117:52.75]Nice.
[117:54.01]My apartment's on the fucking fifth floor.
[117:55.87]We have to kill the nest over there.
[117:58.43]I'm going to throw my ult here.
[118:02.96]I'm gonna throw my crazy thing.
[118:04.14]Oh fuck, we're surrounded.
[118:08.16]Oh poke, that was a legendary throw by the way.
[118:11.03]You just saved all of us.
[118:11.87]I can't see.
[118:18.61]Get me out of the dirt.
[118:24.77]What is all over this guy?
[118:33.78]He's still stealing health packs.
[118:35.44]Am I really?
[118:36.07]Fuck.
[118:41.37]Like I just kind of stop actively paying attention to what I'm picking up, which is I'm going to work on that.
[118:45.41]It happens.
[118:46.39]It's really easy to kind of go.
[118:48.87]So much to pick up.
[118:55.50]You guys are not saving the Earth.
[118:56.82]We just did.
[119:02.22]Is this a health pack?
[119:03.36]How do they all fit in there?
[119:04.44]I don't know, but I only have one more grenade.
[119:08.18]Oh, it hurts.
[119:11.82]Oh.
[119:13.08]Oh.
[119:14.76]Oh.
[119:16.59]No.
[119:17.07]Oh, hell.
[119:30.85]I need to throw him another big grenade.
[119:38.21]Oh, God.
[119:40.37]Sometimes you'll look up to attack a bee and the grass gets at your camera.
[119:44.67]Mm-hmm.
[119:48.17]Dude, you end up looking like you're 10 inches tall.
[119:53.03]Yeah.
[119:53.79]I'm just going for the nest.
[119:56.01]Support me.
[119:57.13]God!
[119:57.63]Okay, throwing grenades.
[119:59.93]No, never mind.
[120:02.59]I've been throwing shit in this hole for a long time.
[120:04.68]There we go, finally.
[120:05.28]When you're done there, there's a health pack right near me.
[120:06.96]I'm not going to yoink it.
[120:07.92]I'm going to actively un-yoink.
[120:10.42]I think we did it.
[120:10.88]There's only a few more left.
[120:12.30]Collect some boxes if you can see any.
[120:15.12]Did the edible kick in yet?
[120:16.16]Uh... No.
[120:20.57]Weird.
[120:24.63]You've been throwing the whole game.
[120:27.29]That person needs to be timed out.
[120:30.19]Let's focus on the game.
[120:31.03]Stop reading my messages, please.
[120:36.19]That's good.
[120:39.73]It wasn't a joke.
[120:43.03]I had to run away.
[120:47.03]I've killed so many bugs in the air with my sniper rifle, you don't even know.
[120:52.64]Yeah, can someone warn this guy?
[121:00.11]Yeah, we missed a couple boxes way back yonder, but I think we got a lot.
[121:04.97]No, we did well.
[121:05.91]We did good.
[121:08.47]Man, this is... So we're just like hard gamers.
[121:12.64]I think we're doing just fine.
[121:14.98]Yeah, I'm surprised all these missions are bugs so far, though.
[121:19.22]They usually warm you up, I guess, on bug mode.
[121:21.20]Nope, they're throwing you right in.
[121:24.32]They don't care.
[121:26.16]Minion buster?
[121:29.11]I know what I'm using that's my that's my favorite weapon in EDF and I can't wait to use it I got a convertible and it's pretty good it got a pretty good roll too armor piercing high explosive shells
[121:55.48]Hey, guys, Sterogerm, if the level is 0, that doesn't mean the weapon's, like, complete crap, right?
[122:02.62]Like, say, I have, like, a level 2 rifle and a level 0 rifle.
[122:05.60]Should I be sticking with level 2?
[122:07.54]It really depends, but always the leveled-up thing is probably going to be doing more damage, but you can have... It really depends on what the item is.
[122:17.62]Like, both assault rifles, like Minion Buster, level 0, versus M1 Raven, level 3.
[122:23.22]it really just depends on what you're doing so like the minion buster is explosive armor piercing shells so it technically is going to do I think more or less damage depending on what you're shooting at I don't know exactly how it works but yes theoretically you should use like your highest level stuff if you can okay I'm gonna try the grit shot
[122:51.02]I still think this thing is better.
[122:52.48]Actually, let me try.
[122:53.20]Alright, guys, watch out.
[122:57.08]We got red monsters in this one, it says.
[123:06.40]So I just got like a passive support equipment that allows you guys to heal 10% more when you pick up stuff.
[123:12.97]I have that too.
[123:14.31]I'm going to put that on as well.
[123:16.15]So I think we can probably double it up so it'll be 20%.
[123:18.03]Okay.
[123:28.31]If you pick up healing near allies, they get some healing from it, a chat member's telling me.
[123:32.50]Mods ban that, chat member.
[123:35.68]Noelle.
[123:36.78]This heals the NPCs when you pick up health boxes.
[123:39.22]Is it both NPCs and players, or just NPCs?
[123:44.87]Good question, I guess.
[123:48.75]Just NPCs.
[123:50.01]Oh.
[123:52.49]Oh, Jerma, tell them about the completion rate, how we haven't even got 1% yet.
[123:56.64]I wanted them to figure that out on their own because they can see that the game is like 5 million missions long.
[124:00.98]Oh no, Jerma, you tell them.
[124:03.44]So when do you beat the game?
[124:04.79]No, Jerma, you tell them now.
[124:08.87]Just tell me.
[124:10.15]Dude, you know what I'm doing tonight?
[124:11.29]You know what me and Holly are doing tonight?
[124:13.27]What?
[124:13.89]Making a pizza.
[124:16.09]Whoa.
[124:16.70]We are making a pizza from scratch.
[124:19.16]Can you?
[124:19.70]Yeah.
[124:21.62]Can you live update us?
[124:23.24]You got New York water?
[124:26.20]no Vegas toilet water alright that's good too same thing uh didn't everyone die in in Vegas recently what are you talking about because it was like 133 degrees oh it was bad yeah but oh what I was going to ask you Jerma yeah what has it been like over there because the weather's been up even here so I I'm the worst person to ask red monster
[124:48.92]These are red ants.
[124:49.90]Okay, big problem.
[124:51.14]Red ants are ten times stronger than the gray ants, and they can bite you, and they won't let go.
[124:56.26]Somebody has to fucking save you.
[124:58.33]That sounds scary.
[125:02.09]I got nukes.
[125:03.11]Help!
[125:03.63]I've been eaten by an ant.
[125:05.01]Someone has to save him.
[125:09.61]You can.
[125:10.19]Okay, if you do get picked up into the jaws, you can fight still, but if you have an explosive, you're going to kill yourself.
[125:17.88]So just be careful.
[125:19.08]Okay, they actually made Fencer really cool.
[125:23.37]I'm glad I tried it with the four dashes.
[125:27.77]Wait, so this game came out like last week, right?
[125:29.87]Or something?
[125:30.27]Uh, it came out like a year ago in Japan, but last week on Steam.
[125:36.46]So you haven't played it yet, sir?
[125:37.96]No.
[125:38.50]You were waiting for us?
[125:40.10]He forced me not to play it.
[125:41.20]I was waiting and I forced Jerma to wait.
[125:43.34]He said I had to wait.
[125:44.07]Oh, okay.
[125:44.85]Was it tough?
[125:47.19]It was hard to wait.
[125:47.93]It was, I'll be honest.
[125:55.17]Someone said in my chat, why does it look like a 2005 game?
[125:58.65]When I say someone, I mean this has been like every five minutes.
[126:01.77]Real answer?
[126:03.15]Real answer would be fine, yeah.
[126:04.55]The real answer is because when they put 7,000 bugs on your screen later, it needs to look like a PS2 game to be able to run at 5 FPS.
[126:13.75]At 5 FPS.
[126:14.51]Yeah, and also graphics don't make a game.
[126:19.32]True.
[126:21.06]Some of my favorite games, current gen, old gen, don't really kind of look like shit.
[126:25.90]I don't care.
[126:28.20]A lot of my favorite games the past five years are Switch games.
[126:31.83]And while the art direction's good, sometimes they run like crap.
[126:34.73]So, yeah, I mean, I agree with that.
[126:36.89]I just want it to not run at F5 FPS, so let's hope it doesn't.
[126:40.81]That would be cool.
[126:42.33]There's always one mission where your computer, like, can't do it.
[126:45.54]There is.
[126:46.68]There will be one where there's, like, like you say, 500 enemies on the screen that all... I don't even know if they have, like, LOD, right?
[126:55.90]I'm not sure they do.
[126:56.70]No.
[126:59.16]For the animations, I believe there's a little bit.
[127:01.14]I think I just full blasted shotgunned the main NPC in the face.
[127:05.81]He walked in front of me.
[127:07.19]He instantly downed.
[127:09.81]Is that the engineer guy that's like, I'm just an engineer.
[127:11.95]I don't even know what I'm doing here.
[127:12.75]Yeah, the scientist.
[127:14.09]I make guns.
[127:14.98]I don't know how to use them.
[127:15.96]Yeah, that dude lights up everybody.
[127:18.42]He doesn't give himself enough credit.
[127:20.52]He's been following me and I blasted him hard.
[127:30.63]I'm gonna drive one of those around.
[127:33.05]They remind me of, like, Command & Conquer vehicles.
[127:34.77]This is a tribes map.
[127:37.75]I'm playing tribes right now.
[127:38.63]I'm fooling around.
[127:41.54]I played the, like, the alpha of the new tribes.
[127:44.46]It was pretty good.
[127:45.16]Is it still good?
[127:46.90]Is it good?
[127:47.48]It's a cash grab.
[127:48.40]Don't buy it.
[127:50.14]Okay.
[127:51.14]I love tribes games.
[127:52.88]Ignore, ignore.
[127:53.72]Okay.
[127:55.07]Not real.
[127:55.45]Were you also the kind of person that played a ton of Ascend until it got bad?
[128:02.50]I don't even think it got bad I was still playing it years later I'm a big fan oh this is kind of creepy I played a ton of star siege as a young lad a lad you're still a young lad until about 15 days from now
[128:22.14]is that when I'm officially old what are you 34 in like a week I believe it would yeah 34. it's actually too long Ster well you gotta check like who do you like I don't have the neural link yet like you guys how old am I today do you need that
[128:45.75]Alright, careful.
[128:46.13]You just have your ID on hand?
[128:48.25]You just know that?
[128:49.39]I check my license every time someone asks me, yeah.
[128:51.71]I'm very quick with it.
[128:54.21]Okay, well I don't have a driver's license.
[128:57.49]I actually don't know how old I am.
[128:58.79]I'm not in line.
[129:00.42]Do you know what year you were born?
[129:02.62]I'm pretty sure 31 or 32.
[129:03.44]I can't... 1932?
[129:03.84]No, no.
[129:04.12]31 or 32.
[129:04.36]I don't know which one.
[129:06.00]Imagine you were born in 1932.
[129:14.46]Dude just revealed he's a vampire.
[129:16.92]I wouldn't tell anyone.
[129:19.60]I wouldn't tell anybody.
[129:20.46]I probably wouldn't say it right here.
[129:23.30]I'd tell a few guys.
[129:25.04]Do like a few guys at the pub.
[129:28.73]Oh, guys, I need saving.
[129:29.67]I'm working on it.
[129:31.87]I'm working on it.
[129:33.59]Don't move.
[129:34.37]He got it.
[129:35.43]You can still shoot when they got you.
[129:37.19]But just be careful if you're going to shoot an explosive because it will just hit you right in the head.
[129:40.80]Alright, Poindexter.
[129:47.71]I want to make sure that people have information.
[129:49.57]I was complimenting you.
[129:54.88]Why are you taking it so weird?
[129:57.26]What is... What was that, chat?
[129:58.84]Did you see that?
[130:02.39]Did a wall shoot me?
[130:03.63]I got you.
[130:06.44]I got it.
[130:06.78]Don't worry.
[130:07.96]Oh, I got him.
[130:08.50]It was all me.
[130:09.28]Did you get him?
[130:10.42]I'm the air medic guy.
[130:11.46]Don't worry.
[130:12.64]You are just like watching over us from the sky.
[130:16.24]I like it.
[130:17.04]You do fly down the hill.
[130:19.50]That was friendly fire.
[130:21.67]Who's got a thing that shoots big red like laser?
[130:24.25]I don't think you're going to get that out of anybody here.
[130:28.97]Yeah, that's not how I'm going to get that answer.
[130:30.67]Alright.
[130:31.51]We got to go down to the bottom.
[130:32.95]Everybody group in the bottom.
[130:34.89]Is my laser red or green?
[130:39.47]I'm colorblind.
[130:40.04]I don't know.
[130:42.20]There's actually a lot.
[130:43.94]It's a lot.
[130:44.44]A lot.
[130:44.78]So we should be together.
[130:49.28]This is humanity's last hold.
[130:51.76]This is a lot, though.
[130:54.66]No more comedy routines.
[130:55.75]Let's go.
[130:56.81]That's what I'm saying.
[130:58.09]If someone goes down, we need to go down in the middle.
[131:01.65]We're being surrounded.
[131:02.99]So many ants.
[131:04.61]Holy shit.
[131:08.10]I have no range on my weapon.
[131:10.34]Oh, God.
[131:10.82]Alright.
[131:13.06]Okay, time to die.
[131:14.18]Holy, don't look at the mini-map.
[131:19.49]Oh, boy.
[131:20.93]Wouldn't think of it.
[131:27.99]I am grabbed.
[131:30.50]Hmm.
[131:32.50]That might have been a mistake, chat.
[131:35.82]Oh, boy.
[131:38.60]I'm knocked out.
[131:42.12]I don't think going into this was a good idea.
[131:44.22]I think we should be standing up on the edge.
[131:46.68]Yeah, you say that, but there's no one else down here with us.
[131:48.82]I'm coming to res.
[131:51.90]I am also down.
[131:52.71]Fuck.
[132:01.61]Vinny, get ready to get up.
[132:03.19]I'm ready.
[132:05.87]Thank you.
[132:11.42]oh there's so much happening I'm grabbed again jeez me too I'm dead again I don't have time to reload oh no I'm dead oh the bit rate is going down yeah it's probably like Vampire Survivors on you Ster yeah
[132:37.12]Sir, I don't be busy, but I'm down over here.
[132:43.35]Yeah, I'm a little busy.
[132:49.59]Oh, we got fucking destroyed.
[132:54.78]Why they don't leave me?
[132:57.78]This is weird.
[132:58.38]I like can't charge my sword while they're eating me most of the time.
[133:02.50]I thought I'd be able to.
[133:04.89]I guess we gotta go to one side.
[133:09.95]Yeah, I would say we should just stand up.
[133:12.82]On the edge.
[133:13.18]We should just go in the direct center and just freak out.
[133:21.02]That's kind of what I did.
[133:23.54]Freak out.
[133:24.72]Dude, I turned left and right, left and right.
[133:27.58]I didn't even shoot anything.
[133:28.80]I just was looking back and forth and I was kind of scared and I didn't do anything and I died.
[133:35.44]I'm gonna show him my blast hole spear.
[133:38.60]Uh, Vinny, you're a ranger, right?
[133:40.52]Yeah.
[133:41.02]I'm thinking we should probably go boom.
[133:43.74]Like, boom booms.
[133:46.16]What does that mean?
[133:46.90]Grenades?
[133:47.98]Like, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, because they, if they get in close, they'll just pick you up.
[133:54.51]He's pretty good.
[133:56.17]I got a, okay, I just got a rocket launcher.
[133:58.35]I'm gonna try it.
[133:58.87]Okay.
[134:05.12]I don't know, maybe like a shotgun.
[134:08.72]Yeah, I got a new shotgun.
[134:10.06]I'm trying that out.
[134:11.50]Do you have the E20 LS or the E20?
[134:14.59]I'm using, yeah, the E20 LS, yeah.
[134:16.67]Was it good for this?
[134:18.29]Level 4.
[134:18.87]Oh, no, I didn't before.
[134:19.99]I used something different before.
[134:21.37]I used the flamethrower and it just wasn't working for me.
[134:24.67]Yeah, we need, yeah, like this.
[134:26.79]Like the big bomb.
[134:28.36]Hmm.
[134:30.64]Hmm.
[134:35.27]Five booms out of five.
[134:41.11]Is this just a mind chat?
[134:42.77]It's anti-aircraft impulse.
[134:47.34]Wait, that's not the... We're Costco guys.
[134:50.14]Of course we're going to do this.
[134:51.46]Is that what that is?
[134:52.00]I don't know.
[134:56.70]Of course.
[134:57.86]We're Costco guys.
[134:58.86]That means we're gonna get the double cookie chunk cookie chocolate.
[135:02.64]Yeah.
[135:03.90]That's what it is.
[135:04.98]I know what that is.
[135:09.46]Do you go on TikTok or Instagram?
[135:11.32]Neither.
[135:11.68]I just see it through other people's streams.
[135:17.31]I'm still on Myspace.
[135:19.09]What do you guys use when you poop?
[135:20.09]Like, what do you use on the phone?
[135:22.86]What do I use?
[135:23.93]I grab these.
[135:24.37]I just black out.
[135:25.25]I grab these.
[135:25.61]You use a plunger.
[135:26.39]You guys actually just read the shampoo bottles?
[135:28.69]No, I just black out.
[135:30.05]Like, I actually, like, when the poop is done, I wake back up.
[135:34.65]Oh, that's so stupid.
[135:36.58]Imagine going into the bathroom and you're just like, fucking dude, I don't even know what happened in there.
[135:40.84]Like, I must have gone to the bathroom.
[135:43.34]Yeah.
[135:43.91]He doesn't have to imagine.
[135:45.11]He just said that happens to him.
[135:46.75]Yeah, it's a brownout.
[135:49.59]You're being hella insensitive about it, man.
[135:51.45]I'm blacked out.
[135:53.13]I just go sit down.
[135:54.11]I'm like, alright.
[135:55.01]What, did you just wake up?
[135:58.01]Do you wake up with a wiped ass?
[136:01.49]Yeah, the bidet, I have an automatic one.
[136:03.31]It detects when it's all released.
[136:06.27]Okay.
[136:11.84]More like it.
[136:20.74]Oh yeah, now we're absolutely... Now we're doing some good work here.
[136:25.41]We're talking, actually.
[136:37.18]What kind of a day do you have?
[136:40.98]Um, I don't.
[136:41.90]Lux.
[136:43.48]I bought it like six years ago and never installed it.
[136:48.04]And finally, I got my friend to help me install it.
[136:52.20]Did you try and give up a long time ago?
[136:53.71]Because that's what happened to me.
[136:55.73]I couldn't unscrew it.
[136:57.45]I didn't even try, man.
[136:58.77]Gotta be honest.
[136:59.37]Just was sitting in the box.
[137:01.55]I was intimidated.
[137:02.37]I couldn't unscrew the toilet thing.
[137:04.47]It was too tight.
[137:06.27]We all picking up health kits at Full Health?
[137:08.43]We're talking about how we clean.
[137:13.10]But that, too, we can do, yeah.
[137:14.58]Yeah, sir, you wouldn't get it.
[137:16.14]I don't get it.
[137:16.96]I don't even wipe.
[137:18.08]Cavemen didn't.
[137:18.80]Why should I?
[137:19.31]I'm on the caveman diet on the caveman toilet.
[137:21.89]No, they just sat and dragged their ass on concrete.
[137:25.71]Yeah, because of all the paved roads back then.
[137:28.03]Okay, dude.
[137:29.17]Stone?
[137:29.71]Rock?
[137:30.67]What do you think it comes from?
[137:32.29]Yeah, how did the Flintstones drive their vehicles if it wasn't paved?
[137:35.95]I think that the Romans invented concrete or perfected it, really.
[137:42.54]I'm telling you, the theme of today is concrete, like the sound pack from earlier.
[137:45.68]That's a good bit.
[137:46.64]There's a lot of potential with this bit.
[137:48.16]I would invest in this bit.
[137:49.22]I agree.
[137:50.39]I think it's got potential.
[137:54.23]Some people have diets where they don't even have to wipe.
[137:58.91]That's like probably the best... like day I've ever had.
[138:01.79]Like that that one day I didn't have to wipe.
[138:04.00]It was just like awesome.
[138:06.00]Yeah but on- but okay- but that that's true. But how many times has that happened to you and you go: something's wrong here.
[138:11.00]No I didn't- I must not have done it good enough. Like what? I don't understand this.
[138:16.00]I know.
[138:17.50]A little messy down there.
[138:19.50]No but honestly if you haven't- if you haven't been in a situation where you don't really have to that much it's like: something- what's going on?
[138:25.00]Yeah.
[138:25.33]Where did it go?
[138:28.33]Alright nobody go down.
[138:31.76]We hang on the edge?
[138:32.38]We have to go down to trigger it.
[138:33.24]Alright, well then, uh... Oh no, here comes Winged Diver.
[138:37.78]The ones are at the bottom, okay, and then we gotta kill them.
[138:40.94]So I guess we wait up top.
[138:43.00]Oh fuck, I'm gonna fall off the cliff from this.
[138:44.52]I just wasted my ulti.
[138:46.16]How do I get it back, by killing?
[138:47.88]Yep.
[138:48.60]Just gotta get enough killing credits.
[138:52.78]Chat, does this Thermite not come back?
[138:56.42]Oops.
[139:01.95]Oh, it does OK.
[139:02.57]Unfortunately, these do not blow up on contact and it's kind of making it a little hairy.
[139:12.46]Oh.
[139:17.66]I try to stay up if you can.
[139:22.04]Yeah, these damage numbers are neato.
[139:23.96]Do you have it over the new families?
[139:28.17]Or do you have it just on the bottom?
[139:29.91]Over your gun when you shoot.
[139:31.25]Yeah.
[139:32.50]I'm like trying to get the high score on every shot.
[139:36.26]It is a very good feature that they've added.
[139:37.90]Okay, this wasn't the hard one.
[139:43.48]This was like the, hey, look, there's a thing over here.
[139:46.14]Yeah.
[139:50.81]Some items down there.
[139:53.27]Get them at the end.
[139:54.71]Okay.
[139:55.15]Yeah, I am not going to fall into this trap.
[139:58.37]I'll get them.
[140:05.60]yeah I see what you're saying like Ster about okay the graphics aren't going to improve because each game we're just going to put more enemies on the screen yeah like I kind of I see its philosophy and I I get it I like it what are you what are you doing buddy what's going on sir we need a poke to go down there oh no okay never mind I thought we needed to like trigger the wave alright this is where we lost last time let's pull it together
[140:37.81]This game seems buggy.

[140:42.75]Same joke in Helldivers.
[140:44.89]Oh, yeah.
[140:46.03]Well, let me ask you a question.
[140:49.39]Why did the teddy bear say no to dessert?
[140:53.12]Because he was fucking fucked up.
[140:54.68]I don't know.
[140:55.74]Close.
[140:56.16]He was stuffed.
[140:58.58]Oh.
[141:01.75]I don't know.
[141:02.41]Should we go help the truck?
[141:04.01]No.
[141:05.27]Don't go down.
[141:05.67]If you go down, you're dead.
[141:07.13]I am the fencer.
[141:08.19]I can go help.
[141:09.79]You've just sealed your death.
[141:11.53]I'll be back.
[141:18.28]Dude, I'm getting 1,000 on my score meter.

[141:28.84]Actually, they're all dead.
[141:32.35]Ah, shit.
[141:34.79]Yeah, they're kind of clumping.
[141:37.11]Oh, yeah.
[141:37.40]Oh, the clumping is so good right now.
[141:39.36]Look at this clump right here.
[141:44.10]Someone's going to have to wipe this hole when we're done with it.
[141:49.49]Callback.
[141:50.53]I fell off.
[141:51.17]I fell off.
[141:51.69]I fell off big time.
[141:53.11]I'm in trouble now.
[141:55.09]I laughed at your fucking joke and now I'm going to die.
[142:00.76]How do I save you, Vinny?
[142:02.24]I think you killed.
[142:04.55]Thank you.
[142:05.05]Drop a bomb in here, anybody.
[142:06.25]Just throw a grenade in here.
[142:09.05]Thank you.
[142:09.39]I can't tell what's happening, but... Oh, they threw me to the bottom!
[142:12.43]They threw me to the bottom!
[142:15.76]Oh, no.
[142:16.72]This is no good.
[142:17.36]Hey, into the fucking fry later, into the pan, or whatever the thing is.
[142:27.45]What do you call the thing that cooks the french fries at the fast food place?
[142:41.03]The, uh, deep fryer.
[142:46.75]The fryer.
[142:47.39]Do you need help any?
[142:53.47]Hey, eat this, you fucking ugly bug!
[142:55.41]Oops.

[143:00.72]We do.
[143:01.06]Yeah.
[143:02.32]I'll play Meatwad on the film.
[143:06.86]Wait, you guys are making a movie?
[143:07.86]We're just doing, like, voices.
[143:09.50]I think that was, like, three years ago.
[143:14.42]Oh, you guys good up there?
[143:15.36]I think so.
[143:19.05]Yeah, we only got a couple of bugs left.
[143:21.12]You're looking good.
[143:21.76]My good bug is a dead bug.
[143:23.05]Oh wait, that's from a movie already.

[143:33.45]I'm having fun with the boys.
[143:37.41]Yeah, this is a good group.
[143:38.85]I like this group.
[143:42.87]Was I weird at all?
[143:44.50]You were a little weird.
[143:45.20]I think we're all a little weird.
[143:48.06]It's good though.
[143:50.40]I think we did it.
[143:51.43]We got out of the really hard mission.
[143:54.35]Someone said there's a second part to that song.
[144:00.97]How do you activate the second part, chat?
[144:17.50]You might have to wait until it ends.
[144:19.34]The mood changed so fast there.
[144:21.60]Or chain, I don't know.
[144:24.04]I don't know, dude.
[144:25.14]We got another, we got another, we got another fire move.
[144:30.41]Press left on the D-pad.
[144:31.97]Well, I don't, I'm not using control.
[144:33.33]Right arrow.
[144:33.97]Okay.
[144:37.33]What is that?
[144:37.81]What is a vibro roller?
[144:39.50]Somebody's called me a scoundrel.
[144:41.82]Fuck you.
[144:48.16]So who's picking the game for next time?
[144:54.98]My birthday is well past, but I'm down to pick something.
[145:00.20]But Jerm, you got one coming up, no?
[145:02.68]Game?
[145:03.92]Birthday?
[145:04.38]Oh, wait, no.
[145:06.10]No, no, you didn't.
[145:06.74]Never mind.
[145:07.08]No, my birthday's soon.
[145:11.16]Wait, is it?
[145:13.00]As a Virgo Libra cusp, I am going to tell you that I would like for you to rephrase your question.
[145:19.26]I don't know what that means.
[145:20.28]Virgo Libra cusp.
[145:22.31]He's asking for your birthday.
[145:23.81]What game do you want us to play?
[145:25.21]Yeah.
[145:25.85]Yeah, you pick one, Jerm.
[145:27.45]Oh, I guess you kind of did.
[145:29.65]Oh.
[145:30.41]I would count this one.
[145:31.53]This is Ster's birthday.
[145:34.30]We're doing a joint birthday.
[145:35.76]This is a joint birthday.
[145:36.90]We share our birthday, like, same day as Christmas.
[145:39.16]And it's, like, so lame.
[145:40.72]Hmm.
[145:47.43]okay I'll pick a game I'll think of what I I think would be fun for us I mean I could choose one of the now dozen Lethal Company likes there's now a medieval Lethal Company there's an underwater Lethal Company there's a Lethal Company inside the prostate there's so many types of that one sounds like ultimately we could do any of those or we could just find a new game we play worms
[146:11.46]Classic.
[146:12.30]So many of them.
[146:13.60]Oh, worms would go so hard.
[146:15.62]Let's do worms, guys.
[146:18.67]Goodness gracious, we can do a worms game.
[146:20.93]I don't know which one, but I'll find one.
[146:27.15]Maybe Armageddon?
[146:27.91]I don't know.
[146:29.45]And are we going to do teams, or are we doing a free-for-all?
[146:32.82]We can decide that on the day.
[146:35.38]Yeah, on the day.
[146:36.56]Day will be tomorrow.
[146:37.86]I decree.
[146:38.60]No, I can't do tomorrow.
[146:39.78]But yeah, one day we'll do it.
[146:43.70]Wow, that... I love making a decree is like very, very set in stone and then immediately pulling back on it.
[146:51.09]Yeah.
[146:54.79]Multiple lock-on device and assist system for guided weapons.
[146:59.05]Single enemy multiple times.
[147:00.35]That's interesting.
[147:01.62]Can we play like dolphin emulator together?
[147:03.48]Does that work?
[147:04.72]Oh, yeah.
[147:05.14]Does that actually work?
[147:07.70]Yeah, you can do it.
[147:08.62]I did that with Metroid Prime 2.
[147:11.24]And, uh, yeah, it works well.
[147:13.00]There's a game called Ribbit King.
[147:14.22]Did you ever play that?
[147:15.43]You're a frog, and it's golf.
[147:17.09]Frolf, they call it.
[147:18.83]People are begging us to make Worms the meta.
[147:21.91]Like, we could do it.
[147:22.83]We could make Worms the new streaming meta.
[147:25.47]But we could also play Mario Party, the old ones.
[147:27.81]Oh, man.
[147:28.13]We could also play Mario Party just in general and just, you know, swear at each other.
[147:31.86]No.
[147:31.96]Anything else?
[147:32.58]You got anything else?
[147:34.38]You don't like Mario Party?
[147:35.96]I hate Mario Party.
[147:36.90]Come on.
[147:37.82]Really?
[147:38.08]I feel like every once in a while, everyone plays it and they get really excited about it.
[147:43.17]I don't know, dude.
[147:43.81]You have to just be like, fucking, like, super high.
[147:46.26]What's wrong with Mario?
[147:47.34]That's like saying you don't like the taste of cotton candy.
[147:49.82]Like, what's wrong with you?
[147:50.58]Yeah, I love Mario Party.
[147:51.86]I'll tell you what, there's a new one coming out.
[147:53.60]So, I mean, maybe that one will win you over, Ster.
[147:56.26]It's going to be the same game.
[147:58.26]I'm sorry.
[147:58.90]I'm sorry, guys.
[147:59.63]I know there's a lot of... You don't... You have to play Mario Party.
[148:03.31]Replacement Ster.
[148:04.39]We'll just acquire a replacement Ster.
[148:05.25]I mean, it'd be funny if you hated it.
[148:06.37]I'm dead.
[148:07.09]I'm dying.
[148:07.79]I'm 1 HP.
[148:12.07]Holy shit, this thing is crazy.
[148:14.09]But yeah, I mean, I'll come up with some ideas, but I like the idea of worms.
[148:17.99]We could do that frog golf game or future Mario Party.
[148:20.77]Those are my three suggestions.
[148:23.05]Write them in the group chat, the one that you're in.
[148:26.47]Okay.
[148:27.45]Can I get a red?
[148:29.32]I gotta be honest, chat, I'm not into Dokopan Kingdom that much.
[148:32.00]Do you guys ever play that?
[148:34.02]What's it called?
[148:34.56]What's that?
[148:35.80]Dokopan Kingdom is a Mario Party-esque game with medieval, like, RPG elements.
[148:42.62]And it's kind of neat, but the games can last forever.
[148:45.29]I mean, I'm just down to do whatever.
[148:50.39]I don't really care.
[148:51.49]Whatever you guys think is fun.
[148:53.39]Yeah, it takes days to go through a match of Dokopan, but Worms is cool because you can play it for, like, two hours.
[148:58.20]Guys, I'm down.
[149:00.70]So, yeah, Worms is really... That might be a good one to check out.
[149:03.34]Is there anybody close to Stirr?
[149:05.66]I could, but I have no health to res him.
[149:07.08]I think this is where Spencer gets very difficult.
[149:09.82]He doesn't like Mario Party.
[149:11.02]Bro.
[149:16.84]Let me get over there and stop roasting.
[149:18.18]Do you have one of those healing grenades?
[149:22.98]I stopped using them.
[149:24.01]Oh my god, you shot me in the head.
[149:26.15]Oh my god, I need one of those reses that we talked about.
[149:35.07]Guys, I'm dead on the roof.
[149:36.01]How are you going to get up here?
[149:36.69]Oh my god, there's a lot of dead people.
[149:38.09]I can't revive you.
[149:38.67]I have no health.
[149:40.85]I have some health.
[149:41.63]I can get to Jerry, but I can't get to Hope.
[149:43.79]We didn't really just let four frogs kill us, did we?
[149:47.55]Yeah.
[149:48.05]These are hard frogs.
[149:49.27]They are hard frogs.
[149:50.35]He had to blow the building up.
[149:55.56]Hey, is this a refresh or are you guys good?
[149:58.08]No, I think we can do this.
[150:00.10]I'm going to blow up the building.
[150:08.27]Oh, hey.
[150:09.21]Alright, there's your corpse.
[150:10.62]Guys, I freaking love a Mario Party.
[150:12.52]Okay, do not kill this guy yet because we should get everybody up first.
[150:18.62]Alright, Ster, where's your... Oh, you're back here.
[150:21.78]Okay.
[150:22.18]Let me rest, Ster, because I have more health.
[150:24.76]Alright.
[150:25.02]Alright, then we can kill this thing.
[150:39.65]Alright, let's kill.
[150:49.16]The FOV when you sprint is puke inducing.
[150:52.58]That is true.
[150:53.70]You are freaking out, sir.
[150:56.46]What?
[151:00.29]Yeah, I'm going to be useful with this mission.
[151:04.83]Arrow keys been.
[151:06.95]I'm pressing the arrow keys and nothing's happening.
[151:09.51]Like, to get different voice lines.
[151:12.99]Oh, I pressed... Yeah, arrow key right for me.
[151:15.23]Not in the wheel?
[151:17.09]Control, right?
[151:18.17]Oh, shit.
[151:18.95]No way.
[151:19.63]No, yeah, just arrow key.
[151:21.21]Oh.
[151:24.13]We did it!
[151:24.95]We did it!
[151:25.21]We both did the same one.
[151:27.09]We both said we did it.
[151:29.19]Jerma, that's actually, like, psychotic that we both chose that same one.
[151:34.88]Oh, no.
[151:35.80]I saw you go down.
[151:37.29]I was trying to do the voice line and I died.
[151:41.25]I wanted to feel included.
[151:46.74]I got to get to when there's a lull in frogs, I'll try.
[151:49.78]It is very unsafe over there, yeah.
[151:54.06]I do not have frog gear.
[151:55.40]I don't really either, honestly, but I think we're doing alright.
[152:00.91]Unless I bait the shot, I guess.
[152:07.77]I can just hang out and just log.
[152:13.17]This grenade launcher is doing pretty good against the frogs.
[152:15.87]Oh wait, I'm dying.
[152:16.57]Never mind.
[152:20.13]Wait, am I spinning?
[152:21.52]Spin!
[152:22.70]Sorry, I had to.
[152:23.94]I'm spinning.
[152:25.22]How is this guy still alive?
[152:26.20]He regen.
[152:28.28]Oh my god, he killed me.
[152:30.06]What the fuck are you talking about?
[152:31.58]Guys, it's over.
[152:32.64]I can't... I have no health to res any of you.
[152:35.69]That's gonna be a GG.
[152:37.75]Oh, I didn't realize I was dying that badly.
[152:39.71]Alright, I'll make sure I get an anti-frog weapon this time.
[152:45.07]My corpse just keeps fucking spinning.
[152:48.23]Ah, it's my fault.
[152:49.87]You guys can all yell at me, it's fine.
[152:52.18]God dang it, Polk!
[152:56.30]Damn it.
[153:01.50]Okay.
[153:02.66]Well... Vinny, you ran into Jerma's acid grenade.
[153:08.81]Oh, that's what that purple stuff was.
[153:10.85]Oh, yeah, that's my that's my poison.
[153:15.19]That's cool, but my poison.
[153:18.47]I'm going to try.
[153:20.33]I'm going to bring the healing grenades just as a backup.
[153:28.64]Try this thing.
[153:32.28]I'm going to aerator all appealing.
[153:40.97]I'm committing the cardinal sin.
[153:42.11]I'm switching around.
[153:43.87]Oh, tell me not to, Jerma.
[153:45.91]No, you can go ahead.
[153:46.77]They still can't use any of their stuff.
[153:51.13]We need better sniper rifles.
[153:57.23]You're going to do Gamba in here, but are we going to beat this right now?
[154:00.93]I would be a believer right now if I were you in the chat.
[154:06.33]Wait, no, you bring the heals.
[154:07.73]I'm going to bring the bunker.
[154:14.84]Alright.
[154:16.81]My level zero weapon.
[154:19.07]How do I do gambling?
[154:19.97]I can't use the V2 burst chat.
[154:24.39]We gotta gamble already.
[154:25.33]Look.
[154:33.00]Okay.
[154:40.00]I like that we're not even 1% yet.
[154:42.66]No, I'm not even close.
[154:45.92]Is it just like missions or like harder modes of the missions?
[154:48.95]Uh, so we will end up on different maps and different enemies and different, there are bosses in EDF.
[154:57.63]Like, and I mean, we don't have to spoil it.
[155:01.12]Okay.
[155:01.50]Uh, but there's going to be like 200 total missions.
[155:03.82]Probably.
[155:21.92]Oh, this thing is actually kind of awesome.
[155:26.79]You just keep like a huge burn on them.
[155:28.35]What the fuck is that?
[155:36.21]These drones are sick.
[155:39.47]Oh yeah, I got the shield.
[155:41.57]I got the one shield we can all stand on.
[155:46.67]You guys have to share.
[155:48.11]This is going better than last time though.
[155:55.24]Look at this guy.
[155:55.78]He's freaking out.
[155:56.60]He's covered in fire.
[156:00.46]If you guys need heals at any point, let me know.
[156:02.32]I've got three heals.
[156:12.02]Oh, I should be shooting their legs off, right?
[156:13.69]Like, that's helpful.
[156:15.73]Yeah, shooting their legs.
[156:16.75]Yeah, they can't move, and it's good.
[156:19.23]You can shoot their gun arm off, too.
[156:21.55]Yeah, everything can be blown off.
[156:34.44]The city's gone.
[156:35.12]They've infiltrated the city.
[156:38.81]Yeah, they did.
[156:40.77]And everything is gone.
[156:41.61]It's been like this for like 30 years, dude.
[156:50.54]The completion is based on number of missions multiplied by number of difficulties.
[156:54.88]So 150 times 6 equals 900.
[156:56.60]So 9 missions is 1%.
[156:59.43]Oh, okay.
[157:01.59]So yeah, there might be like 150 missions on each difficulty.
[157:04.61]They keep giving you new items like in the higher difficulties too.
[157:09.69]So, oh, so like Diablo.
[157:13.63]Yeah, this is just like Diablo.
[157:16.05]Like Diablo 3.
[157:16.93]Yeah, and I got yelled at for that earlier, by the way.
[157:21.31]I see now, though.
[157:22.04]It took me a while to see, but now I see.
[157:23.70]Oh, I actually kind of like aiming the rocket.
[157:35.25]It's fun.
[157:38.13]Is it like a manual aim rocket?
[157:39.75]You shoot it, and you have to move your cursor to aim where it goes.
[157:43.13]Oh, that's cool.
[157:46.60]Per class...
[157:48.73]36 missions is 1% for 3,600 combo.
[157:53.61]Uh, actually pushes up glasses.
[157:56.63]Oh.
[158:06.15]That laser beam from the sky is really cool.
[158:11.99]Oh, boy.
[158:13.41]I actually got scared a little bit.
[158:14.53]Halo!
[158:17.52]Vinny, you still gonna do diaper games with Ster?
[158:19.56]We have to find diaper games to play together.
[158:21.38]Oh, shit.
[158:22.06]That's what I'm saying.
[158:23.91]There's no diaper games.
[158:24.47]Kill that thing.
[158:25.03]Shoot it.
[158:25.35]Somebody shoot at it.
[158:26.01]If that thing lands, we're dead.
[158:29.31]Diablo's a good diaper game, honestly.
[158:32.49]It is.
[158:32.71]I remember I played the last season of Diablo 4, and I got irritated with how I was killing things too quickly.
[158:48.26]You just ult to 4 and be like, yeah, I'm done.
[158:49.66]Okay, they added this giant boss monster in the Helltides.
[158:55.07]And it got to a point where you had to use resources to spawn this thing.
[158:59.67]So it's like, oh, you have to, oh my god, look, somebody has to spawn it.
[159:02.73]It takes like two minutes to spawn.
[159:04.49]The thing is fucking crazy.
[159:05.77]It's like the Blood Queen.
[159:07.80]Yeah, they were there constantly.
[159:09.38]Yep.
[159:10.02]There was always a spawn.
[159:11.38]Always a spawn.
[159:12.26]And you would hear the opening dialog of like, yeah, shit.
[159:16.18]I'm here!
[159:18.06]That's its death sound.
[159:18.78]Immediately dead, yeah, exactly.
[159:20.77]So, it was just like, I don't, and then like this legendary ding ding ding ding ding, legendary ding, legendary ding ding ding ding.
[159:26.85]It's just like, I don't know, I'm not even playing a game.
[159:28.47]Like, what the fuck am I even doing?
[159:29.21]Everything lost all meaning.
[159:30.95]Yeah, like, what the fuck am I even doing?
[159:32.05]I'm not even fucking playing a video game.
[159:33.71]Like, what the hell is happening?
[159:35.63]D4 bad.
[159:38.23]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[159:40.90]Chat, what was that game I played that was like Path of Exile on D4?
[159:45.19]the time travel.
[159:47.73]Yes, Last Defuck.
[159:48.59]I played a little bit of that.
[159:49.37]That was alright.
[159:52.01]Oh, you guys are over there.
[159:52.85]I'm drawn to the giant alien ship.
[159:56.79]You guys remember when Diablo 3 let you sell items for real life money?
[160:01.14]Oh, that was such a disaster.
[160:03.14]Holy crap.
[160:03.76]I thought that was a good idea.
[160:05.26]My friend bought an iPhone.
[160:08.70]Excuse me, really?
[160:11.32]He got an iPhone off selling like a burger item.
[160:16.61]Digital burger equals iPhone.
[160:18.34]Got it.
[160:18.72]Yeah, I think it's cool.
[160:21.64]I thought it was good in theory.
[160:23.04]It didn't.
[160:25.06]Right.
[160:25.78]It ended up being pretty bad.
[160:27.02]But then you realize that they had to make the drop rates on everything so abysmal because no matter what.
[160:33.23]They did.
[160:34.19]Yeah, but no matter what, there's a billion people fucking playing it.
[160:37.41]So there's going to be like 10 trillion stones of Jordan.
[160:39.61]So they have to make the drop rate like 0.0001%.
[160:41.07]I could go on.
[160:43.79]You guys don't even know about the Russian mafia that controls all the items in Path of Exile.
[160:50.23]Is that real?
[160:50.53]No, I do not.
[160:51.19]Yeah, pretty much.
[160:54.57]Did you encounter them?
[160:56.94]Not, no.
[160:59.64]I got frogs behind me.
[161:04.56]When you said Stones of Jordan, you just, like, unlocked so many memories of wind forces and SOJs in public lobbies and just scammers.
[161:12.86]I remember I used to... No, give me your memory.
[161:15.24]Give me your memory first.
[161:16.83]well in diablo and warcraft 3 in order to get someone to join your match you'd have to put free beer remember that no it's like trading trading room free beer or like um tides of blood for warcraft 3 free beer and people would join like 50 more why so I don't know what's your memory
[161:39.42]That's crazy.
[161:40.64]I remember the Warcraft 3 custom games were just so much fun.
[161:44.78]I would play those with you.
[161:46.30]These are your guys' first memories?
[161:48.90]No, they're just some memories.
[161:50.56]Oh, I thought we were doing first memories.
[161:52.24]This guy's talking about Warcraft 3.
[161:53.62]There would be a massive problem if the only thing I could remember is Warcraft 3.
[161:57.38]There's like 20 years that I apparently did not remember before that.
[162:02.60]My first memory is throwing the Pee Wee Herman doll out of the car window.
[162:08.35]So what were you saying about Warcraft 3, Jerm?
[162:11.77]I would love to play Darwin's Island with somebody.
[162:14.71]That was one of my favorites.
[162:16.48]So if you want, one day I would love to play that and I'll put free beer in the title and we can get a bunch of people.
[162:22.14]Nice.
[162:22.94]I'm down.
[162:23.22]I used to play StarCraft and put a no rush 20 minutes.
[162:28.85]Would you betray your foes?
[162:30.29]Oh, that's right.
[162:30.97]I would rush.
[162:32.29]Yeah.
[162:33.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[162:34.87]I got four barracks outside their base.
[162:36.50]How fucking crazy is the internet really just because it was just kind of based on the honor system, right?
[162:40.58]If somebody could just be lying to you and it doesn't even matter, like they were going to be lying.
[162:43.94]Everyone's wise now.
[162:45.64]I'm mad to this day.
[162:47.70]Diablo II had a whole bunch of like melee only like PvP lobbies.
[162:52.02]And if you went in there and used Whirlwind, everyone would get mad and say that's not melee.
[162:56.55]Really?
[162:56.87]That sounds like melee to me.
[162:59.35]It sounds like it, but that's wrong.
[163:02.61]Okay.
[163:03.20]Because you could whirlwind paladins outside their range of attack when they stood still and you can't walk or your armor goes to zero.
[163:08.62]And they were getting mad.
[163:11.16]All I remember from PvPing in D2 is just sitting in the Rogan camp right at the line where the game decided that you were out in combat and just dying from a sorceress, just lightning.
[163:26.11]Well, if somebody did, like, the druid fissure on the ground, or blizzard, and you weren't there when it happened, it's invisible to you.
[163:33.70]The second you leave, you, like, insta-die to an invisible blizzard.
[163:38.38]We are surrounded.
[163:39.60]Yeah, we are.
[163:40.22]I have healing.
[163:41.32]Poke, if you want, I can heal all of us if we get somewhere.
[163:44.81]Okay, okay.
[163:46.25]I'm down.
[163:46.67]So I'm going to get to Jerma.
[163:48.57]I'm running back.
[163:49.17]I'm running back.
[163:49.69]I can rez Jerma.
[163:50.23]I can rez Jerma.
[163:50.89]I'm alive.
[163:51.19]I can rez Ster.
[163:51.73]I can rez Ster.
[163:53.37]Rezzing.
[163:54.05]I am still currently alive.
[163:55.77]I died trying to rez.
[163:57.48]I am going to cry too.
[164:00.24]Oh, there's like fucking spaceships.
[164:01.66]Oh, there's squids.
[164:02.92]This is a big mission.
[164:06.47]I think we forgot about the giant thing behind us.
[164:08.55]Jerma, I'm dead.
[164:10.59]Everyone's dead except you.
[164:12.27]I threw a healing grenade near their bodies, but it's pretty hot over there.
[164:16.21]The fucking stupid thing.
[164:18.07]I fucking hate it.
[164:18.91]I'm good.
[164:21.63]Wait, is the healing grenade also healing you right now?
[164:24.17]Yes, it is.
[164:26.71]Oh, God.
[164:29.00]I'm going to instantly die again.
[164:31.86]I'm right next to you guys.
[164:32.48]I'm closer somehow.
[164:33.88]Nice.
[164:36.88]I am dead, but I hope I got a few of you.
[164:39.70]You got us, but I am dead now too.
[164:43.54]I'm coming.
[164:44.10]Alright, that's it.
[164:44.78]That's match.
[164:45.50]This thing is opening.
[164:47.12]Oh wait, no poke.
[164:47.76]You're alive, wow.
[164:51.25]This might be one of those missions where you just have to survive long enough and then it ends.
[164:54.95]Oh, I'm dead.
[164:57.71]Yeah, I would just poke just run away.
[164:59.05]Because I think there.
[165:02.91]This is going to be like a we need to retreat.
[165:06.09]type of thing yeah poke you're good yeah what happened what the happened to those frogs they fell in the toilet that's sucked up oh how come we didn't get sucked in because we're all dead poke's still alive yeah enemy ship gone where did it go wait is the mission over
[165:34.84]yeah oh get loot it's beginning that's the tutorial he doesn't know he hasn't played this and now the sky has turned red oh that's nice play the real game I could have got some loot that's actually nuts that that you were able to survive that that's cool
[166:04.34]Yeah, just fly around.
[166:05.72]And welcome to EDF.
[166:08.40]We get like a video of like the lead designer gives us like a 10 minute video of like how they made the game and stuff.
[166:13.51]I wish they would do that first.
[166:28.78]Alright, Chad, this is the question I'm going to ask you.
[166:32.36]The lock-on rockets, I feel like they don't do that much damage.
[166:36.92]Did they get better?
[166:37.90]I don't remember.
[166:40.18]They don't do a lot because they're supposed to kill the air bugs.
[166:46.00]They suck, LOL.
[166:47.60]Pretty much just worse.
[166:48.66]They're terrible.
[166:50.02]Sir, he just ignored you and waited for Chad's answer.
[166:52.44]I mean, that's normal.
[166:58.37]I get it I can't hear my like listening to myself hey and we got a two months sub coming through thanks a lot dude but uh alright I'm back what's uh what just thanks for the raid five of y'all just just talking to my chat man just talking to my chat what are we talking about yeah yeah yeah mm-hmm yep actually
[167:28.33]I should really like that.
[167:30.99]Yo, can you guys hear me?
[167:33.17]Can hear you, yeah?
[167:34.81]Yeah.
[167:35.39]How do I sound?
[167:37.35]Distant.
[167:37.77]Cute.
[167:38.01]Are you in the bathroom?
[167:43.82]No, he wouldn't be because he can't pee and talk at the same time.
[167:45.62]Try talking in game.
[167:46.50]Try talking in game.
[167:47.26]Press V. I can't hear you.
[167:50.38]V?
[167:50.98]Can you hear me?
[167:51.62]Oh, my God.
[167:52.48]Oh, no, I can't.
[167:53.20]That's so loud.
[167:53.96]Oh, the voice quality is not bad.
[167:57.27]No, it's not.
[167:59.62]I honestly expected the worst quality.
[168:01.79]Like 8 bits.
[168:04.57]You would imagine that the graphics are as dated as they are.
[168:09.79]We'd see some dated audio technology, but I guess not.
[168:13.42]No, because we are soldiers.
[168:15.58]Brave and strong.
[168:16.98]What's the worst thing you guys done on the online video game, like griefing?
[168:23.14]Trust test Diablo II.
[168:25.40]Yeah, I'd say probably being scammed by the ring trick in D2 just kind of turns you into a supervillain.
[168:32.89]I used to join Gary's mod servers and spawn cranes until it crashed.
[168:36.91]I mean...
[168:44.05]I don't have, um... It was StarCraft, I would join the matches and build a base.
[168:49.81]I would build, like, bunkers in my... We got aliens.
[168:52.83]We have, like, weird robots.
[168:54.08]Holy shit!
[168:55.14]Oh, those are so fucking weird.
[168:57.08]They're like... I pretended to be a girl and ran across the line so I could get bunny ears.
[169:01.72]It's flying.
[169:03.64]Ralph in Second Life.
[169:04.50]Yeah, Second Life, I did some stuff.
[169:07.10]Wait, what?
[169:07.68]What are we talking about?
[169:09.85]Ster, they would call that based...
[169:12.94]Basset.
[169:13.64]Basset even.
[169:14.45]That's such a base move.
[169:17.71]They're like brains.
[169:19.03]They're brains in like armor.
[169:20.25]It's weird.
[169:23.85]Yeah, poke.
[169:24.41]I would build bunkers in my allies' bases and say I was fortifying them and then I would click off ally and become enemy and then the bunkers would kill their entire base.
[169:33.49]And what game is this?
[169:34.79]What game is this in?
[169:35.47]Starcraft?
[169:35.99]Starcraft 1.
[169:36.51]I think I'm going to have to make a report player later about this.
[169:40.04]No, it's fine.
[169:41.26]Oh no, don't report me to Blizzard.
[169:42.82]Then I can't play their games anymore.
[169:46.09]I'm just not so sure I can sit here and listen to this.
[169:48.59]I'm just kind of fucked up.
[169:53.85]My weapons are not good for this.
[169:55.09]What the heck was that?
[169:56.55]This looks like a lot of hits.
[170:01.62]These mortars do surprisingly no damage.
[170:05.74]You gotta get him locked in with the napalm and you gotta fire the machine gun chat.
[170:09.71]How the free if you stand still, oh.
[170:13.45]So this is good.
[170:14.37]Yeah, I'm having trouble here.
[170:16.53]Oh no.
[170:20.31]Oh my God, you're gonna hurt me, aren't you?
[170:23.57]Yes, that's weird.
[170:24.85]That was really strange actually.
[170:31.20]I got you Vinny.
[170:35.41]Thank you.
[170:37.83]At least I hope I do.
[170:45.39]Dead instantly again.
[170:46.57]Wow.
[170:49.91]But in World Brothers, didn't they add like the the Titan killer from Attack on Titan?
[170:55.70]They made like a whole like Attack on Titan character.
[171:01.58]I don't know.
[171:02.34]I'm one.
[171:03.48]I think so.
[171:05.57]Pack on Titan.
[171:11.08]You guys watch anime?
[171:14.02]I've heard of it.
[171:16.04]I allow myself to watch one anime a year.
[171:21.17]Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.
[171:24.37]Oh, that's a lot of Aarons in the chat.
[171:30.01]Aaron.
[171:31.29]Aaron.
[171:36.24]Yeah, I just can't stay alive.
[171:38.54]Yeah, I don't got good loadout for this one, man.
[171:41.93]I'm weak as shit.
[171:43.49]Yeah, same.
[171:45.17]I'm going to die in three, two, one.
[171:49.13]I'm okay, but I'm spending the whole time reloading.
[171:54.03]This... Is this it, though?
[171:57.47]Or is there more after this?
[171:58.28]I don't know.
[172:05.31]You do have full health, but you are the only one.
[172:08.11]OK, I'm coming for you guys.
[172:09.37]You got it.
[172:29.69]Thank you.
[172:30.43]I took so much health.
[172:33.55]That did take a lot.
[172:34.79]That took like 75% of your health.
[172:36.89]I have 1 HP.
[172:40.83]Yeah, Poke, if you can find a building just to stay away from everything and just snipe if you have anything that can go far enough.
[172:49.03]Because if you kill stuff, you might have, like, health might drop.
[172:52.71]I'm going to put my special down.
[172:53.71]Oh, there you go.
[172:59.37]It's doing work.
[173:08.58]Oh god.
[173:16.10]Nice.
[173:23.35]Oh my god, Poke, you have a sneeze of health.
[173:26.09]You have nothing.
[173:28.53]I'm right here.
[173:29.89]Yes!
[173:36.06]Why would you intentionally make the clumsiest looking robot you could fathom?
[173:42.98]It's funny.
[173:44.44]What if their kid made it?
[173:47.00]Yeah, I guess the aliens have a sense of humor.
[173:49.30]What if their kid made it?
[173:51.88]Yeah, they just... Oh, we'll definitely use those robots.
[173:57.42]Yeah, but honestly, for all we know, we are like chump dog shit in comparison, and this is like a joke to let your kids send the goofy aliens to a planet dang.
[174:06.44]Right.
[174:07.30]Like, we think we're fighting these intelligent aliens.
[174:09.45]That one just did a backflip, so I'm going to take away everything I just said.
[174:11.69]Yeah, this is like a fridge drawing.
[174:14.71]That was pretty sick.
[174:16.77]I do not have range.
[174:19.19]Is everybody?
[174:19.79]Oh.
[174:21.11]Jerry.
[174:22.31]I can't res.
[174:22.91]I got one.
[174:24.40]I would focus on killing because rezzing is going to nearly kill one of you.
[174:31.56]And there's only like five left.
[174:36.28]My weapon loadout is like hot garbage.
[174:41.60]Mine's good, but I really am.
[174:43.17]I have a lot of downtime.
[174:44.69]Take your kids to first aid.
[174:48.51]That's true.
[174:55.93]Can I res with 28 health?
[174:57.29]28?
[174:57.57]I got Jerma.
[174:59.11]Okay, we're good.
[175:00.61]I mean, not a lot of health, but it's alright.
[175:02.05]You're going to be hurting, but alright.
[175:03.67]I think we're good.
[175:11.13]What the hell happened to those?
[175:12.05]Come on, you guys.
[175:19.00]He's kind of just poking up his head over there.
[175:27.39]There's another one.
[175:28.39]Kind of far away.
[175:31.29]Yeah, that was, I think that was the last one.
[175:34.61]Right here.
[175:35.03]There you go, lads.
[175:43.58]Okay, are we good?
[175:45.26]Or is there going to be like another huge wave?
[175:46.90]I hope not.
[175:47.90]Oh God.
[175:48.18]There's another.
[175:48.68]Someone needs to bring healing.
[175:51.62]There needs to be some form of...
[175:54.59]medicare it's not over yeah you should I humanity next time I'll bring but let them remember that the edf fought until the very end I have my special up please go back we've lost don't be so defeated true don't be so defeated be realistic here the edf was destroyed three years ago from the blast of two other ships
[176:25.76]Gherk.
[176:28.22]Gherk.
[176:29.54]Gherk.
[176:34.12]Alright, well, you know their move set now.
[176:36.34]Dodge, use your flasks, and stay on your toes.
[176:39.88]Embrace the carnage.
[176:51.78]Incoming wall of napalm, sir.
[177:04.94]Who damage each?
[177:05.82]Just trying to like blanket explode the entire area.
[177:11.00]It's kind of working.
[177:11.80]I think as long as we're patient, you don't like need to get shot at.
[177:20.25]Yep.
[177:21.45]You can kind of.
[177:22.45]Oh, you can kind of stay far.
[177:26.17]Yeah, they're getting they're getting closer.
[177:27.52]They're getting.
[177:29.78]Yeah, I don't feel safe over here.
[177:31.67]I'm running.
[177:33.83]I'm going to get some more distance.
[177:36.87]Same.
[177:37.11]Hiya.
[177:48.08]Do you see fire?
[177:48.94]Just be careful because it's mine and it will hurt you.
[177:52.70]Oh, fire bad.
[177:53.80]Fire bad.
[177:54.34]If I see fire, I will not walk into it.
[177:57.84]No!
[177:59.33]Alright, I got a little too close to the action.
[178:01.15]I'm running.
[178:03.95]I'm so weak!
[178:14.66]Oh my god, that was flying into my screen like a 3D movie.
[178:25.33]My mortars would reload when I'm weapon swap.
[178:28.87]Oh no, I'm died.
[178:29.69]Oh, I'm going to kill myself.
[178:31.47]Oops.
[178:32.91]I'm dead.
[178:33.35]Oh no.
[178:33.87]I had to take one out with me though.
[178:40.31]Derek, good luck.
[178:49.57]I mean...
[178:53.51]just based on reload times if I were to do this it would be here for a very long time I think am I the only one up you're the only one there's there's so many there is if you can get away though and run all the way back and revive poke I don't have the health to revive you don't have I think you can revive no matter what can't you no it like kills you oh
[179:26.60]I mean, I could probably stay alive forever, but I don't think there's any healing.
[179:31.95]There is.
[179:33.03]There's healing by my body.
[179:34.69]There's one small crate.
[179:37.09]It's the little green blip on the map that's closest to you.
[179:43.20]There you go.
[179:43.68]There might even be one over the left as well.
[179:46.18]Does it really pop up like that?
[180:04.23]let's fight together help man yeah I think uh I think I'm just gonna die that we can move on well help man give it a shot at least yeah I think I this I would like it it would take so long we could be here for 30 minutes okay
[180:23.38]We're going to retreat.
[180:24.48]You guys are going to come in with your biggest guns and your hottest babes.
[180:29.66]Okay.
[180:31.68]Yeah.
[180:34.20]I think we can do it.
[180:35.30]At least we got two health for that.
[180:37.36]We got one.
[180:39.76]Alright.
[180:45.08]I think it's a shotgun or a long-range missile.
[180:47.06]That's my best alien killer.
[180:48.18]So they have armor.
[180:50.52]So anything that would pierce armor?
[180:54.69]Vinny, use the shart?
[181:02.00]What are you talking about?
[181:10.44]The VTuber.
[181:11.16]Oh, the shark.
[181:12.24]I can't.
[181:13.14]It won't let me bring the VTubers.
[181:19.95]The VTubers have better stats.
[181:21.43]I know, but they're...
[181:23.27]They're not unlockable yet.
[181:31.53]I don't know what the hell I want to use here.
[181:32.71]I think I'm just going to go with the regular rocket launcher.
[181:34.79]Honestly, just the default one.
[181:43.49]No, this one's good.
[181:51.26]Hmm.
[182:00.09]I'm never believing again.
[182:01.65]Well, you should believe because we got it right now.
[182:07.67]I don't know, chat.
[182:08.28]What do you think?
[182:09.02]Maybe should I stick with the stampede?
[182:10.56]I feel like that was doing okay.
[182:15.58]It really does make you wonder what to do.
[182:21.68]default shotgun and rocket.
[182:25.47]I'm going in.
[182:26.85]The shotgun is so good just because if you get all the pellets on their head, you can just like blow their armor off their head.
[182:33.55]Brains out.
[182:34.53]Yeah.
[182:36.94]It's gross too.
[182:38.04]Green and shit.
[182:39.76]I so wish we could spawn tanks in.
[182:43.14]We're going to be able to very soon here.
[182:48.94]Protective soup, both long and straight.
[182:51.62]What is this?
[182:52.43]Strong and light.
[182:53.15]Wow, I just got those words totally mixed up.
[182:54.89]That's awesome.
[182:56.37]Vinny, what's your favorite topping on pizza?
[183:02.55]Would it be weird if I said onion?
[183:04.55]No.
[183:04.94]Yes.
[183:06.12]No.
[183:07.02]I'll tell you why.
[183:07.52]Because onion is a great complement to other toppings.
[183:13.49]So while pepperoni or sausage may be my favorite, onion works really great with them.
[183:18.47]I feel like onion on a pizza is a decision that will carry me through the rest of the day.
[183:26.64]It sticks with you.
[183:27.94]Your day needs to be like, this is an onion pizza day.
[183:31.72]I can't do anything else.
[183:32.80]You want to talk about snacks?
[183:34.70]Okay, I got one for you.
[183:36.89]Oh, I'm listening.

[183:38.31]It's hummus, right?
[183:39.27]And it's a brand of hummus, and it's a type of flavor.
[183:41.83]I have never seen this before.
[183:42.85]It is the Cedars hot honey hummus.
[183:47.33]Listen closely.
[183:48.62]You're going to buy that.
[183:49.50]You're going to get it.

[184:45.33]I'm interested in whatever you just said.
[184:47.83]I'll give it a shot.
[184:48.71]Yeah.
[184:49.83]I feel like I have a way worse loadout this time.
[184:53.37]My loadout is so good this time.
[184:54.96]It is perfect.
[184:56.30]I'm trying some shit and it's not... It's not it.
[185:08.20]I'm killing them in like two hits.
[185:13.45]My shit sucks.
[185:17.41]I'm indifferent.
[185:18.47]Mine's OK.
[185:29.62]Oh my God, they're behind that pole.
[185:31.08]Got in the way.
[185:35.12]I'm going to be useful.
[185:35.92]I don't know if you guys want to restart.
[185:39.34]How how useless?
[185:41.53]Yeah, you think super useless or what the word implies?
[185:44.77]OK, well.
[185:47.13]If you want a better loadout, we can do that.
[185:50.53]Do what you must.
[185:53.57]Looks like he's dying.
[185:56.49]I like this.
[185:59.47]Like this letter.
[186:02.21]Yeah, as much as I could be messing around, I I combine those things the other day.
[186:07.59]And like my pupils dilated.
[186:11.88]why because it was so hot it was just so good it was just like holy shit oh good alright your pupils dilated from hummus I had an experiment and I want to hear it from you guys too because it's kind of fun to do so it's it's a game where you put up all of your favorite things and it's almost like a tier list of everything like what is something that you don't think you could like like food wise or beverage wise that you don't think you could live without
[186:43.45]Uh, water.
[186:44.81]Rice.
[186:45.09]Okay.
[186:46.09]Rice.
[186:47.69]What else?
[186:48.41]Steamed rice.
[186:49.85]Basmati.
[186:51.13]Okay.
[186:54.44]Salsa.
[186:55.60]Okay.
[186:57.04]Salsa versus white rice.
[186:58.94]What would you rather have?
[186:59.64]Remove the salsa.
[187:00.58]I don't have the rice.
[187:01.22]Okay.
[187:02.14]Is there anything that you could put up there that you would say you would want instead of the white rice?
[187:08.40]Like if you listed like your top five favorite foods on Earth, like which one truly wins?
[187:14.32]And it could be additives too.
[187:15.84]It could be, you know, even like coffee.
[187:17.58]Because when I did this, I was sitting around, me and my girlfriend were doing it.
[187:20.90]We were just like, hey, what about coffee?
[187:24.60]I don't think I can live without coffee.
[187:27.14]So coffee is very important to me.
[187:30.53]Yeah, but water is, it's in everything.
[187:33.13]70% of your body is water.
[187:34.45]75% of this planet is water.
[187:35.79]Which is why you need it to survive.
[187:41.23]Someone just said, this is just convoluted.
[187:42.79]What's your favorite food?
[187:44.97]Yeah, but it makes you have to really think about it.
[187:46.06]No, because you're pitting them against each other.
[187:47.12]They have to go against each other.
[187:48.02]It's not just what's your favorite food.
[187:49.32]It is... If you could... Not just what's your favorite food.
[187:53.16]By the way, all the other stuff goes away.
[187:57.02]Yeah.
[187:58.37]Yeah, coffee's pretty important to me.
[188:01.73]Wait, you can't dash with this at all?
[188:04.67]Reset again?
[188:09.79]My tops were, and actually in this order, this is going to sound crazy, but what the fuck was that?
[188:16.99]It was like a dentist drill in my ear.
[188:19.89]What the hell was that?
[188:25.16]And why am I jumping with a jackhammer?
[188:28.82]Yes, sir.
[188:29.34]I feel like if you need to reset again, go for it.
[188:30.94]Do you?
[188:32.38]Hell no, but I'm here to support you, man.
[188:41.17]I think I'm good, but we can restart for you if you need to.
[188:43.73]No, it's okay.
[188:44.83]I'll figure it out.
[188:46.25]Yeah.
[188:46.41]Yeah, I'll figure mine out, too.
[188:48.64]It's alright.
[188:50.50]Are we okay?
[188:51.18]Yeah, Jerma, I think there's a place that has an amazing burger that made me realize I don't think I can live without burger.
[189:01.64]Yep.
[189:02.06]I know it's a very American answer, but if you're ever in New York City again, you have to try this burger.
[189:08.65]Dude, the pizza that we had is the best pizza I've ever eaten.
[189:12.03]Yeah.
[189:12.47]Like, it was just so good, and it's frustrating that there's nothing like that out here, period.
[189:16.52]I say it to you every time.
[189:20.62]Wait, what's the burger?
[189:23.02]Uh, it's just a smash burger, but it's done, like, to perfection.
[189:28.58]Are you gonna keep the name, or...?
[189:29.68]I...
[189:33.09]Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.
[189:34.25]It's called Hamburger America is the name of the place.
[189:36.33]And it's this dude, George Motz, who studied the burger for years and made like burger documentaries.
[189:42.57]He studied the burger while you were in school.
[189:45.34]I was studying the burger.
[189:47.18]He did, he did.
[189:47.98]And it's really probably the best burger I've ever had.
[189:50.76]I don't want to overstate it.
[189:51.86]I've had some gross ass burgers before, man.
[189:54.12]Like, I don't know.
[189:55.56]I'm listening.
[189:56.92]It's a smash burger, so it's gonna be... It's not like one of those novelty burgers that you can't get your mouth around.
[190:02.00]Oh, hate them.
[190:02.58]Hate those.
[190:03.22]Throw them away.
[190:03.70]I don't like it.
[190:04.58]Throw it away.
[190:05.16]No, this one's legit.
[190:06.18]This one's legit.
[190:06.90]So that one has been my favorite thing recently.
[190:12.13]And yeah, pizza as well, Jerm.
[190:13.87]And you know what, man?
[190:15.01]Dude, let me tell you something.
[190:16.45]Empanadas.
[190:17.17]A good fucking empanada is like... I don't know if I want to live without one.
[190:22.73]Jamaican beef patties are better.
[190:25.96]Sorry.
[190:26.84]That sounds interesting to me.
[190:28.91]Those are good, but I know some good empanadas.
[190:32.71]Everyone's dead for you.
[190:34.25]Really?
[190:34.77]And I'm the one who's saying my weapons are stinky?
[190:36.75]Yeah.
[190:37.49]I started talking about empanadas and I got hungry.
[190:42.99]I actually haven't had a good empanada.
[190:44.75]I have not had a good empanada.
[190:45.93]Okay.
[190:46.31]I just like beef patties.
[190:48.27]They're good.
[190:50.12]Yeah.
[190:52.82]That just hurt.
[190:55.71]That yeah Vinny was like, it was so perfect.
[190:58.84]We were retreating the mission and we're in the middle of a conversation and you're just like, yeah.
[191:05.72]That was a perfect way to describe that.
[191:08.00]Good yeah.
[191:09.59]Thanks man.
[191:10.49]I work hard on my yeahs.
[191:14.99]You should door dash something.
[191:16.47]No, I just told you we're making a pizza.
[191:18.95]We're making a pizza tonight.
[191:19.89]We'll be good.
[191:23.18]Yeah, I was full health you guys.
[191:25.20]Coffee, hummus, and olive oil.
[191:26.58]Can't live without any of... I would... I would go... Oh, well, yeah.
[191:29.88]Olive oil.
[191:30.42]I mean... Yeah, that's pretty vital, I would say.
[191:33.25]That's a vital thing.
[191:35.99]Can't live without those three.
[191:40.15]I think I could live with everything except, like, if I had to give up water.
[191:44.52]You don't, you don't go through food phases where you're like, this is the thing.
[191:47.48]Oh, I need this.
[191:48.28]Oh.
[191:48.73]And then like a couple, like a month ago goes by and you're like, nah, I could, I could do something else.
[191:52.97]Also every anime ever made is about how adaptable humans are and killing God.
[191:59.61]You say you can't live without those, but if I took them away tomorrow, you'd be like, nah, this is fine.
[192:05.13]I really like Pop-Tarts now.
[192:06.73]No, no, that's not true.
[192:07.91]That's absolutely not true.
[192:09.23]If you got rid of my coffee every day, I would fucking turn into a werewolf.
[192:12.57]You would end it.
[192:13.95]I would turn into a werewolf.
[192:15.35]I said I would turn into a werewolf.
[192:17.71]Well, you said you can't live without it.
[192:20.87]I'm pretty sure that implies something.
[192:23.60]So, coffee doesn't exist.
[192:29.00]if there's if there's no coffee I'm putting the fursuit on you know what I'm gonna lick my own paws you know what I'm saying like I'm done I'm sorry sir I'm doing a Jerma and I'm being Jerma right now oh okay got it got it uh I like I like blacked out for a second I wasn't sure what was happening um yeah I coffee hummus really uh you know do you want to know something crazy
[192:56.13]No.
[192:57.29]Okay.
[192:58.13]You drink water every day, right?
[192:59.65]You drink water every day.
[193:00.39]We all drink water every day.
[193:02.79]We do.
[193:03.27]Yes.
[193:03.73]You know what else?
[193:04.59]I eat every single fucking day of my whole life.
[193:07.27]Hummus?
[193:08.07]Every single day.
[193:09.79]And you know something?
[193:10.77]Hummus hasn't hit me yet.
[193:12.99]That's just unfortunate to hear.
[193:14.94]Do you have a... I mean, I know you mentioned some hummus stuff earlier, but can you recommend a good brand from the supermarket that I can try?
[193:23.26]uh if you have cedars it's good if you have tribe it's good uh I think what's the what's the other big popular one I don't really like it that much but cedars is good you can make your own too so yeah sabra sabra has gotten better in my opinion but I feel like they they do too many weird flavors and I'm not into half of them you know I've been doing like another one maybe not one that I could
[193:51.48]live without or couldn't live without uh but yogurt is another thing because it's good for you but I've been like enjoying it a lot lately so it's very good yeah yeah but I'd be able to jump with this shield I'm stuck in this hole probably forever okay god these enemies are really annoying on hard mode Jesus yeah they're pretty rough yeah this is tough they're quite tanky really hard out of nowhere
[194:21.85]You gotta break into their M&M's shell and get to the chocolate in the middle.
[194:27.42]I played an M&M game yesterday, Jerma.
[194:29.82]Like a platformer on the Wii.
[194:31.58]That was one of the worst games I've ever played in my life.
[194:36.72]You know, I feel like I've played... Was it M&M's Beach Party?
[194:40.87]Nope.
[194:41.47]Because that one's awful as well.
[194:43.49]They're all bad.
[194:44.83]I've played several M&M games and they're all terrible.
[194:47.53]I don't know how this keeps happening.
[194:49.99]Why even Jake games?
[194:50.81]Like where m&m keeps like green lighting ga- yeah why do- I don't know.
[194:54.43]Easy cash grab?
[194:56.89]Cool spot enjoyers?
[194:59.11]I rented cool spot at least three times from blockbuster when I was a kidster so sadly yes.
[195:05.01]It's not that good but I liked it.
[195:07.39]I loved it.
[195:08.33]There's another like top down from god's perspective cool spot game.
[195:14.43]What the hell is Cool Spot?
[195:15.73]The Lord.
[195:16.25]It is the logo for Pepsi?
[195:19.03]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[195:20.07]I thought it was the logo for 7up.
[195:23.25]7up, 7up, yeah.
[195:25.11]Yeah, you play as the logo and you... I don't know.
[195:28.55]You platform.
[195:29.77]You just go around like a fella and you shoot like bubbles, I guess?
[195:33.74]This is back when like food, beverage, and like just characters that were on advertisements were fucking cool.
[195:41.78]Remember when Joe Camel sold cigarettes to us children?
[195:44.52]Yeah, well, that guy was an asshole, but... He was kind of a jerk, let's be real.
[195:48.92]But, I mean, I don't know, like, did, like, the Coco Puffs bird just kind of, like, fucking freak out and, like, do a bunch of drugs?
[195:54.17]Drug addiction.
[195:54.51]Yeah, and he fucking starts screaming and stuff, and it tricks rabbits.
[195:59.43]Oh, I'm Coco Puffs!
[196:02.21]I saw a tony the tiger commercial the other day and they kind of made him small he's not like a great he's like a they made him like a little guy yeah no he's on ozempic good one I like that why did he do ozempic I don't know
[196:24.43]It's 2024, man.
[196:26.03]He said he's off.
[196:27.65]Like, what, he's on roids?
[196:28.75]He's, like, not on roids right now?
[196:31.35]Yeah.
[196:31.67]He said they made him smaller, right?
[196:36.00]Is he bigger or smaller?
[196:37.04]Oh, yeah, he's smaller.
[196:38.50]Yeah, he's chilling.
[196:40.70]Maybe he just stopped doing roids.
[196:42.52]He's getting old.
[196:45.62]I just want all the serial characters to like all... You know what?
[196:48.79]They could really make sales go up.
[196:50.73]They could make sales go up.
[196:51.65]Just have Tony the Tiger just have a commercial be like, I am declaring a fucking all out war and fight with the Cocoa Puffs bird.
[196:59.81]I'm going to kick the shit out of him.
[197:01.48]Like it would be amazing.
[197:02.50]That'll be another bad Smash Brothers clone probably.
[197:08.34]I gotta fight them.
[197:09.88]I can't fight them in the open.
[197:11.02]You know what I mean?
[197:16.99]I gotta stop moving when I shoot this.
[197:18.65]Barely fight them and they're not open.
[197:21.45]As long as they don't get here that quickly.
[197:24.71]Hey, pick your favorite serial character.
[197:32.94]You can pick me, Tony the Tiger.
[197:35.14]I'm a strength character.
[197:38.04]Are you talking about multiverses?
[197:39.72]I'm talking about why there's no soulslike with serial characters.
[197:42.34]Would the Lucky Charms Leprechaun be like a mage?
[197:47.76]Or like a luck-based character.
[197:49.10]Yeah, I guess a mage.
[197:49.86]Yeah, probably.
[197:53.72]And then they have like those off-brand mascots.
[197:58.32]Yeah.
[197:59.38]Maybe you can fight them.
[198:05.78]Serial souls, though.
[198:07.01]Where'd you guys go?
[198:08.39]We ran away.
[198:09.19]I'm surrounded by every single one of them!
[198:13.93]Do you ever see the cereal that's similar to the cereal we know, but it doesn't even come in a box?
[198:18.42]It's just, like, in a bag?
[198:20.04]Yeah, those things are awesome.
[198:21.86]Yeah.
[198:23.22]You guys ever get good shit from the cereal boxes?
[198:26.63]Yep.
[198:27.31]I got a Roller Coaster Tycoon from one.
[198:30.27]The whole game?
[198:31.61]The whole game from a cereal box.
[198:33.09]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[198:35.22]Yeah, and I drown people.
[198:39.33]The water the water park the water slides and if you angle them weird they just fall off and just fly off and It's a weird memory.
[198:46.70]I had I don't like that as a kid Okay, but you look down everybody park.
[198:52.38]Well, you know you could kill people in rollercoaster tycoon like really easily could we like euthanasia coaster?
[198:57.25]Yeah
[199:01.19]Oh, so I can simulate people?
[199:02.63]Well, they're all drowning now.
[199:03.79]Yeah, as like a 13-year-old, I do kind of remember being sitting there like, oh, I could have this roller coaster crash into the wall.
[199:10.88]I did that.
[199:11.46]And then you kind of sit there and go, why did I do that?
[199:13.50]Is that what 13-year-old Charma sounds like?
[199:21.42]Sorry not to make fun of you.
[199:24.60]Yeah, why did I sound like that?
[199:32.64]Speaking of sounding like something, man, I had the ultimate Tom Hanks voice the other day.
[199:38.46]It's fucking unbelievable.
[199:42.42]Have you guys ever gotten a Tom Hanks voice when you're eating something?
[199:45.84]No.
[199:47.90]Protect me, and I don't know if you guys can hear my stream.
[199:50.38]I actually have it.
[199:52.44]Wait, protect you?
[199:53.40]Just make sure I don't die so you can hear this.
[199:55.68]Oh, in-game!
[199:56.89]Okay, in-game.
[199:57.81]It takes that much energy?
[199:59.17]Okay.
[200:00.33]I... What Tom... Okay, Holly sent it to me.
[200:03.63]Um, Tom Hanks' voice is when you get, like, kind of a bubble in your throat, and it makes you kind of start talking like this.
[200:09.67]I had it happen to me a day ago, and it was un-fucking-believable.
[200:14.47]I sound like a different person.
[200:15.59]I sound like inhuman.
[200:18.03]You ready for this?
[200:19.33]Yeah.
[200:20.19]Do I have to watch your stream to hear it?
[200:23.54]Oh yeah, you probably do.
[200:35.01]Okay.
[200:35.53]I'll play it again.
[200:36.97]You ready?
[200:38.23]No, I'm not.
[200:39.23]I'm gonna play it.
[200:40.09]Chad, can you just get me a clip from JermaStream?
[200:43.33]Yeah, after the horde, I'll listen to the Tom Hanks voice.
[200:45.53]After this mission, we can listen to your fucking celebrity impressions.
[200:52.47]How would you expect us to know what's going on?
[200:56.65]Chad, I threw the healing by accident.
[200:58.75]Why did I do that?
[201:04.51]Okay, there is a lot yeah, we should move we should move I Got rid of my healing because I thought I had a grenade like a regular grenade.
[201:18.62]I fucked up.
[201:19.46]We gotta back up Oh Jerma, I wanted to throw one more at you eggs Oh
[201:30.19]I don't really fuck with eggs that much.
[201:32.58]Dude, I'm dead.
[201:33.24]I can't.
[201:34.82]Just to revive a dead conversation for a second.
[201:37.05]I wanna throw eggs at you.
[201:39.75]You eggs?
[201:41.61]I love eggs.
[201:42.85]Every day I have eggs.
[201:44.11]Like either scrambled or omelet or over easy.
[201:47.09]That's like a vital food group for me.
[201:48.96]You don't get sick of them?
[201:49.86]Eggs are amazing.
[201:51.62]No, with cheese, salt, pepper, bacon.
[201:54.00]Like there's so many ways you can do eggs.
[201:56.20]I feel like good and stuff.
[201:58.48]I like ketchup.
[201:59.60]Ketchup on eggs is amazing.
[202:00.84]That's perfect.
[202:02.22]I just got into ketchup on eggs.
[202:04.97]Bacon, egg, and cheese with ketchup and salt and pepper.
[202:07.01]That's a new thing for me.
[202:08.87]And I'm really like, oh, this is great.
[202:12.20]Ketchup and grilled cheese is good as well.
[202:14.84]It can be, sure.
[202:15.72]I had a grilled cheese this morning, so... So yes, to your point, I do get a little sick of eggs, so I mix it up a little bit, but like five, six days a week, I'm eating eggs for breakfast.
[202:25.45]Anybody else fighting 30 baby robots?
[202:28.21]No, I'm just talking about eggs.
[202:33.85]Fucking high heel near automata babies.
[202:39.00]I'm just running backwards a lot.
[202:40.66]I'm gonna kite them.
[202:41.40]So it's just me and Jerma, but Jerma's almost dead.
[202:45.20]So I'm gonna keep kiting them and hope that I live.
[202:50.66]I got a melee weapon.
[202:57.74]I understand the game now, like, why it's like this too.
[203:02.16]All these fucking robots are just working.
[203:04.26]They're not even lagging, they're just working.
[203:07.73]Yeah.
[203:08.55]You see that?
[203:09.01]Uh-huh.
[203:12.40]You guys have a job.
[203:14.10]You guys got it.
[203:14.82]I'm gonna rez, I'm gonna rez.
[203:17.22]Okay, I'm gonna just keep hiding.
[203:20.82]Yeah, do your thing, Polk.
[203:24.02]Nice.
[203:25.04]Hey, weren't you doing this without an air raider?
[203:27.40]Oh, my God.
[203:30.88]Oh, there's no way I'm living through this.
[203:32.12]I'm just gonna do this.
[203:33.06]Nope.
[203:35.66]I need a heal.
[203:36.68]There's no way.
[203:40.64]That is not Tom Hanks.
[203:41.60]No, it is, but that was so bad.
[203:44.10]It was so deep and so crazy.
[203:46.15]That's the deepest and most ridiculous it will ever get.
[203:49.27]It's usually lighter than that.
[203:52.47]I know the phenomenon you're referring to, Jerm.
[203:54.41]I never thought to call it Tom Hanks voice, so thank you for introducing that to me.
[204:01.71]It's when you have, like, an air bubble, right, in your throat or something, and you just don't fuck it.
[204:06.06]Exactly.
[204:06.72]You just don't, like, get rid of it, and it still will.
[204:10.58]Dude, what if you could learn how to do it whenever you want?
[204:12.62]That'd be awesome.
[204:13.50]You'd be famous.
[204:20.53]You'd be in Castaway.
[204:21.65]Alright, Vinny.
[204:26.58]It's up to you.
[204:36.94]Vinny, imagine you can make choice or voice or multiplayer.
[204:39.34]Oh, you know what?
[204:42.80]That may be on the potential list for the future.
[204:46.59]That'd be really sick.
[204:51.55]That's pretty cute.
[204:52.55]All you guys act and talk like aliens from another planet.
[204:56.05]Yeah, I couldn't.
[204:56.55]There's no way.
[204:57.19]They know.
[204:58.39]They know.
[204:59.69]Somebody found us out.
[205:11.32]Man.
[205:12.14]I'm on worms.
[205:13.30]I'm kidding.
[205:21.02]I'm going to need you guys to bring your A game.
[205:24.01]Been trying.
[205:24.81]This is a tough mission.
[205:25.69]This is a hard one.
[205:26.71]It is.
[205:27.65]I think I just got some good ones.
[205:29.03]I don't know what to use.
[205:30.73]Okay, I got to use this, but I won't.
[205:35.85]I'm not going to do anything dumb.
[205:37.43]We're not going to talk about scramble eggs or Tom Hanks.
[205:42.15]I feel like scrambled eggs and Tom Hanks go well together.
[205:44.97]Can you show us the voice now?
[205:46.93]Can you show us the sound?
[205:48.25]Oh, you want to hear it?
[205:49.11]Okay.
[205:49.21]Yeah, I'm going to go on your stream.
[205:50.99]Okay, so here it comes.
[205:51.85]So this is, I'm asking my girlfriend to please take her phone out to record audio.
[205:58.69]And it's funny because I'm like, oh, I don't want to rush you or anything.
[206:01.79]But like, this is an immediate problem that we need to have solved.
[206:05.65]Okay, I'll play it one more time.
[206:07.19]Honey, get the camera!
[206:08.40]No, that's actually what happens.
[206:11.64]Okay.
[206:12.08]Everyone's begging me in my chat to stop, please.
[206:14.78]So that means I'm going to do this at least one or two to three to five more times.
[206:17.72]Okay.
[206:18.88]You ready?
[206:19.70]You want to hear it?
[206:20.24]Yeah.
[206:20.98]Yeah.
[206:21.16]I don't want to rush you.
[206:22.91]I don't want to rush you.
[206:23.87]Yeah, I'm listening.
[206:24.79]What do we have?
[206:26.59]Probably.
[206:27.47]He is muting indefinitely.
[206:28.81]The ultimate Tom Hanks voice.
[206:31.01]For the record.
[206:31.93]I don't know what to do about it, but frankly.
[206:34.53]Oh, no.
[206:36.53]Oh, we hear it on the stream.
[206:37.93]Yeah, that's what we said.
[206:39.52]Chat, just get me a clip, please.
[206:41.88]I can't be- I really can't be, like, bothered.
[206:51.09]Jeremy, you didn't hear- No, that was- that was good!

[207:42.19]Um, okay.
[207:43.67]This is your birthday.
[207:45.11]I don't want to rush you or anything, but we have probably the ultimate Tom Hanks.
[207:53.35]Okay, there you go.
[207:54.71]I hope you laughed at it.
[207:59.75]It sounded nothing like Tom Hanks.
[208:01.37]No, it's the thought of Tom Hanks.
[208:02.87]It's not actually him.
[208:03.99]They had to hear that like 20 times because of this.
[208:07.12]okay alright we uh I think we got this guys are we gonna go for it yeah look at all these new viewers here you know how many times I've done the Tom hanks voice I think you're just showing how how new you are
[208:41.88]Jerma, can you record one of those celebrity videos for me where they say, oh, hey, just heard today's your birthday.
[208:48.67]Can you record one of those and send it to me?
[208:50.75]Can you do a cameo?
[208:52.63]Yeah, if you want one.
[208:53.73]For what?
[208:55.65]For my birthday.
[208:56.79]Okay, so you want a birthday cameo that starts at $5?
[208:59.21]That's for a 10-second video.
[209:03.34]If you would like to go a little bit longer and do a 30-second video, it's going to be about 50.
[209:09.04]Not now.
[209:09.68]Send it to me later.
[209:21.27]Oh, what the hell?
[209:22.67]Vinny, can you say happy birthday?
[209:25.11]I'll just say it once and you can just clip it.
[209:27.77]And if anyone asks in the future, just send it to them.
[209:31.04]Happy birthday.
[209:35.10]Yeah.
[209:38.10]I'm actually going to try as hard as I can.
[210:02.02]Uh-oh.
[210:06.71]What?
[210:08.51]Where did my mouse just go?
[210:12.99]This loadout's pretty good for this.
[210:15.93]I'm murdering them.
[210:17.77]Mine is terrible.
[210:19.52]Are their bodies, like, a weak point?
[210:21.38]Or is it just... No, maybe not, like, their necks?
[210:24.74]It's probably the connecting point where their head meets their neck.
[210:27.81]Like that little spot where you can just... Vinny, did you turn on the damage number thingy?
[210:34.91]At the bottom?
[210:35.77]Or on the screen?
[210:37.19]Like, per... You can put the numbers, the damage numbers on them.
[210:41.89]Yeah, there's a damage number, but... Oh, I didn't know you could turn it on them.
[210:45.00]Alright, I know I need to do that.
[210:47.40]I'm just dead, though, real quick.
[210:50.34]I'm going to be joining you very soon.
[210:52.84]Everybody seems very injured on wave one.
[210:55.66]We are very injured.
[210:56.60]There's a lot of stuff we haven't picked up though.
[211:10.28]Is there help back here?
[211:13.64]Whoa, you're here.
[211:14.71]Oh lord.
[211:24.46]This is very dangerous.
[211:34.67]Sure is.
[211:43.77]Good death pose.
[211:45.05]Yeah I got a good one.
[211:46.65]oh you can shoot the hands yeah the gatling gun is really good if I just like shoot forward at one they can't the vtuber decoys work really well with these guys but I we still can't use them I think we will very soon I heard mission 13 you get all of the stuff you can't use yet
[212:07.85]I mean keep in mind there are like a hundred something missions there's like hundreds of missions to play so they probably just like drip feed the first little bit out for you there are chat members that haven't played this game and they're like use the vtubers and it's like no we can't I just go into random stream chats and say be a vtuber I know it's fun I really I really get a kind of a thrill out of it I do too
[212:35.25]Alright, Vinny, I think I might have enough health to get you.
[212:39.85]Ster's got me, but I have a health grenade if you want, so poke and Ster.
[212:47.52]Once Jerma gets here, I'm going to throw this health grenade.
[212:50.84]I am there in five, four, three, two, one.
[212:54.94]Okay.
[212:55.67]Wave two.
[212:56.21]Wave two of three.
[212:58.43]We can do it.
[212:58.91]Why are you guys shaking like crazy?
[213:01.03]Yeah, you guys are shaking bad.
[213:02.45]This is not healing me.
[213:05.63]You're not near us.
[213:06.27]You're probably desynced like crazy.
[213:08.57]Okay, then where is it?
[213:10.27]It's right here near me.
[213:11.85]I pinged it.
[213:12.35]No.
[213:13.25]It's gone now.
[213:14.64]That was weird.
[213:15.52]You were standing right in it.
[213:16.36]You got none of it.
[213:17.44]I'm not getting any healing from it.
[213:19.22]It's probably a syncing thing.
[213:21.02]Is there a health pack right here?
[213:22.94]I can't tell on this building.
[213:26.02]Well, it's okay.
[213:26.60]I only lose health when you guys die.
[213:29.62]Let's check this building for health.
[213:31.89]Damn, that was so cool.
[213:32.71]Oh, it's like stuck on me.
[213:34.53]I'm gassing wherever I go.
[213:36.26]I can't see anything.
[213:38.98]OK, that's great.
[213:40.58]Is this a heal over here, sir?
[213:41.92]I don't want to touch it.
[213:44.72]I don't think so.
[213:46.40]Oh, it's a weapon.
[213:50.21]Yeah, it's on top of you.
[213:51.63]That's weird.
[213:52.51]And yet it's not healing me any.
[213:58.19]OK, it's gone.
[214:10.02]Nice.
[214:13.56]Well, that was... Yeah, I think we are desyncing because people are teleporting around.
[214:17.08]Oh, that's cool.
[214:25.55]Ow.
[214:31.03]I'm going to see if they climb up here and I can 1v1 a couple babies.
[214:34.70]I think we're doing okay.
[214:37.92]We're in a horrible position right now.
[214:46.71]they oh my god no I'm dead up here I didn't I didn't think he was gonna like have it ready that quick or I'd shoot him guys I'm dead on the roof okay thank you yeah I I got you let me kill this guy and I'll come get you oh my god why are these all the same oh yeah
[215:13.89]I'll get you in a minute.
[215:15.03]Oh, this weapon maybe isn't that great.
[215:18.25]Maybe it's better on their heads.
[215:23.32]Oh, geez, that took away... Holy shit, that's a lot of people over there.
[215:26.76]90% of my health.
[215:29.78]I'm just beaming from the roof.
[215:32.04]I think I'm on the ground behind you, Poe.
[215:33.88]Oh, I'm coming.
[215:37.90]It's getting crazy.
[215:44.47]Wait, I took half my health.
[215:46.11]Yeah, it's brutal.
[215:48.41]Ster, I have health.
[215:49.47]I'm going to throw a health grenade near you.
[215:51.77]So if anyone wants health, come to me and Ster.
[215:53.45]Hopefully it'll work.
[215:54.83]I'm kind of good, and I think I'm just going to stay back here.
[215:56.76]Alright.
[216:02.18]Yay, healing.
[216:02.92]Yeah, it actually works this time.
[216:04.62]Look at that.
[216:04.94]Oh, Lord.
[216:05.56]They're all coming over here.
[216:06.62]Oh, my goodness.
[216:09.67]Wait, did the shield...
[216:12.60]I feel like the shield wall was good.
[216:31.85]I would actually take some of that.
[216:44.08]Big explosion.
[216:45.88]Yeah, I think I got him.
[216:47.60]I think I got him figured out.
[216:52.42]Feeling good.
[216:53.00]I really like this.
[216:55.36]This slugger is cool.
[216:57.39]Slugger was great.
[216:58.87]Yeah, I like that one for this.
[217:02.65]Oh.
[217:02.77]Whoops.
[217:03.07]Did we do it?
[217:03.71]Did someone raid me?
[217:16.95]Shame Vinny sluggers at low level.
[217:18.51]Yeah, that kind of sucked.
[217:20.21]But... Free raiders?
[217:23.43]Oh yeah, that happens once in a while.
[217:25.09]Yeah.
[217:26.97]Thank you whoever raids, even if it's three.
[217:28.87]I'm just, you know, I'm kind of like locked in right now, you know?
[217:32.13]This is our big moment.
[217:35.26]Yeah, we can't look at chats right now necessarily.
[217:37.76]Or talk about cereal or eggs.
[217:40.46]There's some warnings.
[217:41.80]Yeah.
[217:42.14]Mods.
[217:43.52]Just warnings for everyone, right?
[217:44.90]They warn all the benches.
[217:45.86]Warn both benches.
[217:52.81]I love just throwing this grenade across the whole map.
[217:54.67]It's just so fun.
[217:56.03]I missed that grenade.
[217:56.85]I should use that again.
[217:57.67]It's very good.
[218:03.50]I'm nostalgic for three hours ago when I first used that grenade.
[218:07.50]It's like, what's going on?
[218:13.21]Oh, they're coming from... We should probably back up a little.
[218:15.25]Because they're going to collapse around us.
[218:20.43]Back it up.
[218:25.96]it's crazy how mobile the fencer feels now I can just leave hit the bricks you can leave I'm just gonna keep shooting rockets up in chat the other gun is is much more close range
[218:49.12]Benny, my breakfast is a Red Bull and Cosmic Brownie.
[218:52.77]Correction, your breakfast is a Red Bull, a Cosmic Brownie, and two Tums.
[218:58.27]What's a Cosmic Brownie?
[219:01.69]So, it's a sh... Little Debbie.
[219:04.53]Oh, the Betty ones?
[219:05.52]Oh, okay.
[219:06.06]The Betty, yeah, the Betty.
[219:07.68]I know that is.
[219:09.12]It's, uh, yeah, they're good, but they're very, like, I always, always get indigestion from those things.
[219:15.35]Oh, I hate zebra cakes.
[219:18.53]Yep.
[219:19.31]Also, they're weirdly wet, aren't they?
[219:22.41]They are.
[219:22.81]They're wet.
[219:23.27]They're like weird.
[219:23.91]Yeah, they're like moist brownies, which usually is cool.
[219:26.67]But how do they stay good for so long?
[219:28.41]It's like, I don't know.
[219:29.47]But when you start to see the condensation build up in the plastic package, that's when it's like, what do I do?
[219:34.13]Yeah, I know.
[219:35.39]And I noticed that, too.
[219:36.45]You know, when the mold starts growing on them, that's when I stop eating them.
[219:44.35]But not before.
[219:47.24]It can be like a steak a little bit, like aged steak is fine.
[219:51.87]I like how you just compared a cosmic brownie to a steak.
[219:54.55]It's kind of the same.
[219:57.67]It's almost the same thing, yeah.
[220:02.73]I'm very hit or miss with little Debbie like snacks.
[220:05.35]Cause like some, sometimes like the cosmic brownies are, are amazing.
[220:08.23]The oatmeal cream pies are kind of good for the first two bites and then like teeth hurt.
[220:12.31]Those things are so good.
[220:13.75]You got it.
[220:14.11]You got it.
[220:14.55]Delicious.
[220:15.97]Yeah.
[220:16.15]Yeah.
[220:16.33]You can't have the whole thing in like one quick go.
[220:18.53]Cause that's just like pain.
[220:20.49]It's awful.
[220:29.33]Oh, there's somebody right next to me, I guess.
[220:31.71]Where is he?
[220:33.66]okay um you guys seem pretty chill over here I'm coming we're pretty chill I think there's a lot of stuff to collect there's a lot of guys that followed me onto like a skyscraper that are coming this way chat is this gun better if I ricochet it off the ground or is it the same thing I need help it's the same damage okay
[221:04.67]Oh, I just... Yeah, I ain't using that again.
[221:10.02]I can get you up.
[221:16.88]Got any more of those grenades?
[221:18.42]I do.
[221:18.90]I have one more.
[221:19.48]Uh, so, everybody, let's go to... Ooh, I'm dying down.
[221:26.01]I got you, I got you.
[221:26.71]I'm picking up a box.
[221:31.31]I'm going to head to where Ster is and poke.
[221:34.17]Oh, come on.
[221:35.51]Fuck.
[221:35.87]Did Jerma just shoot him?
[221:38.41]What?
[221:40.86]I saw him die to an explosion, and I know these enemies don't do explosions.
[221:44.48]Must have been one of those fucking bugs.
[221:48.64]That's a bug.
[221:51.61]There's a glitch, you mean.
[221:53.15]Yeah.
[221:53.61]Oh, we got to go pick up boxes.
[221:55.41]It's box time.
[221:56.01]There's a healer.
[221:57.25]There's a heal thing.
[221:58.39]Oh, you're right.
[221:59.19]Wave's down.
[221:59.63]We got to go grab.
[222:01.24]Run.
[222:02.34]Oh, that's a lot of stuff behind us.
[222:05.06]Yeah, we're going to miss all that, huh?
[222:07.18]No, you might really get a couple.
[222:08.04]Oh, that was my job.
[222:10.72]Oh, we got one.
[222:12.22]Yeah, we didn't realize we actually beat them.
[222:14.48]That's still a lot of stuff.
[222:15.61]That's a lot of stuff.
[222:16.97]I got a couple cool things.
[222:18.59]Oh, I got Bloodstorm.
[222:21.27]I just got to set up the incantation first.
[222:24.31]Ooh, what's this new shotgun?
[222:25.75]A fully auto shotgun.
[222:28.25]I am freaking out.
[222:35.08]Got to be very close to people.
[222:45.87]Yeah, I'm not crazy about that bound gun that I just was using chat.
[222:49.27]That one's like kind of.
[222:51.55]Yeah, it's like its main feature is ricochet, but I'm sitting here like when do you need to ricochet?
[223:02.04]Can we use the VTubers?
[223:03.72]No, I don't think so.
[223:04.96]Underground.
[223:06.78]Oh, wait.
[223:09.33]I think I have a VTuber.
[223:13.83]How do you check that?
[223:14.53]I think you have to... Can you only do it as Ranger?
[223:17.93]You have to go in your backpack.
[223:19.63]Oh...
[223:30.41]Wait, you got a weapon that improves public relations?
[223:34.31]I'll take... I think it's level 8.
[223:40.03]So what does it do?
[223:43.54]Have you read it?
[223:45.60]Department to recruit young people at events.
[223:48.56]Purpose of recruiting soldiers... Oh, it's a combat decoy.
[223:52.78]Are we all using the combat decoy?
[223:55.00]Or maybe just one of us?
[223:57.31]I picked it up.
[223:58.51]If we all want one, I guess.
[224:02.44]Chet, didn't Gaur Gura have something Vinesauce meme related?
[224:07.00]Am I thinking of the right one?
[224:11.06]Yes?
[224:11.42]What was it?
[224:14.66]She name dropped you?
[224:17.16]Oh, that's cool.
[224:20.76]Well, guys, officially I'm the most famous one here now.
[224:27.15]Feels pretty good.
[224:28.81]Yeah.
[224:31.28]Well, I retired.
[224:32.06]You were on that one, like, cops episode or whatever.
[224:34.62]That's pretty famous.
[224:37.20]Yeah.
[224:38.00]Poke, did you know that someone was getting arrested on, like, cops or something like that?
[224:42.35]Like, a similar show.
[224:43.55]And, like, one of my stupid videos was in the background.
[224:45.83]It was, like, just me screaming.
[224:49.42]Really?
[224:49.74]Yeah.
[224:50.32]Yeah.
[224:51.86]Oh no.
[224:52.86]It was so, it was a bizarre thing that I still don't fully understand what happened.
[224:57.14]You gotta show me that.
[224:58.54]I'll link you to it, yeah.
[224:59.53]That's so fucking funny.
[225:00.93]That is so crazy.
[225:02.55]That's unbelievable.
[225:09.15]I think I'm gonna try the double blood storm.
[225:13.25]But these enemies don't even bleed.
[225:16.29]Actually, I probably wanna go with... Actually, no.
[225:21.05]I'm getting a drink from the fridge that's a reset angle if I double I already have a shotgun I need like something like this yeah I don't I don't love this thing but it is way better might actually be pretty good here yeah I bet you I bet you it will
[225:50.47]I bet you it will, dude.
[225:54.09]Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[225:56.20]Wait, wasn't Polk not here?
[225:57.56]Oh no!
[226:01.70]Dude, I saw a ready up and pressed ready.
[226:04.38]Yo!
[226:07.18]Alright, so Rookfruder.
[226:08.40]Hello.
[226:18.31]How do I use it?
[226:21.65]Like that.
[226:23.11]Oh my fucking god.
[226:26.75]It's like the decoy in Metal Gear Solid 5, but more anime.
[226:30.99]Wow.
[226:32.35]Oh.
[226:35.41]Jeez.
[226:37.41]I wonder how much health.
[226:39.43]Does it absorb a lot of damage or something?
[226:42.02]This thing might actually be fucking awesome.
[226:46.44]I feel that I wasted it.
[226:47.10]I'm being taunted.
[226:48.28]I can't get away.
[226:49.02]I'm taunted.
[226:49.62]Oh my god, it's still going.
[226:54.39]We have to fight.
[226:54.97]It's still going.
[226:57.79]Kawaii.
[226:58.83]That's a net.
[227:02.63]I got rid of it.
[227:09.94]I am so fucking dead.
[227:16.62]Auto shotgun's kinda good.
[227:28.61]Has to bring the shield down.
[227:30.81]Oh, that's a banister.
[227:32.83]Wait, what?
[227:39.00]It lasts for like a second.
[227:41.72]Chad, that sniper rifle is not working good against...
[227:45.85]The these fellows.
[227:47.86]Oh, actually works.
[227:50.18]OK, this this.
[227:51.48]Yeah, blood storm, not for these guys.
[227:54.68]Oh, those were one time use.
[227:57.26]Oh, fuck.
[227:59.18]OK.
[228:02.00]Wait, is she dead?
[228:06.00]No.
[228:08.91]Oh, now they regenerate.
[228:09.89]OK, cool.
[228:14.29]No, how am I still alive?
[228:15.49]I don't know.
[228:16.09]Wait, could I have used the tank on this level?
[228:20.03]No, I think it's level Mission 13.
[228:21.89]The lore explanation is the whole military is gone, so you can't call for tanks.
[228:27.61]Understood.
[228:30.59]I figured the VTubers and tanks are about the same thing, so I wasn't sure.
[228:35.25]Yeah, I don't know.
[228:38.11]I have another VTuber.
[228:40.79]Throw it down.
[228:42.52]Yeah, what the fuck is this thing doing?
[228:44.14]That's a sentence.
[228:45.87]That's a throw down.
[228:51.29]Don't kill me.
[228:52.93]Okay.
[228:53.61]40.
[229:00.02]Looney Tunes Rush.
[229:03.78]What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[229:09.03]I miss every shot.
[229:12.73]I'm raising you, Vini.
[229:15.10]Thank you.
[229:15.46]I got some goodies to collect.
[229:17.92]Yeah, I definitely chose, like, all the wrong items.
[229:23.80]But we'll, you know, just keep trying.
[229:28.24]You're doing great.
[229:30.67]Who needs items?
[229:32.17]Yeah, we're talking about it in the Path of Exile group chat.
[229:36.05]I just got my first Parasaur, so I'm happy about that.
[229:43.31]Dude, first chaos orb, dude.
[229:46.23]Big.
[229:48.49]Pretty big deal, I know.
[229:52.63]Alright, they should attack her.
[230:03.41]And we can fight them.
[230:11.52]I have a C4, so if they get close to her, I can detonate the C4.
[230:15.14]I see.
[230:17.52]I'm beginning to understand the bloodstorm.
[230:19.62]Whoa, what?
[230:22.51]Oh, he's behind me.
[230:27.95]Holy shit, that was like a Helldivers moment.
[230:32.21]I got stuck in a balcony and I died.
[230:34.94]I actually saw you just kind of fall off the balcony.
[230:38.22]Yeah.
[230:47.75]Star, are you still alive?
[230:49.11]Yeah.
[230:49.37]Okay, good.
[230:50.37]Okay, is everybody else dead?
[230:52.23]Yeah.
[230:52.97]Not me, though.
[230:53.58]I'm still alive.
[230:54.26]I'm going to try to get Jerma.
[230:55.96]I'm in a bad way right now.
[231:02.56]Whoa.
[231:05.95]Is that you doing that?
[231:07.29]Yeah, that is me.
[231:09.01]That move is kind of ridiculous.
[231:14.13]It takes a really long time to lock on, but it is very good.
[231:23.08]I'm going.
[231:23.84]Thank you.
[231:25.78]There's health.
[231:28.38]There's a big first aid.
[231:29.44]Oh, that's a first aid.
[231:31.19]Oh my goodness.
[231:36.96]I'd love that the shotgun could like what yeah is that you doing yeah just in one shot you can take like seven vehicles it's crazy what the hell only the height of realism in edf6 I hope this is the last wave otherwise we're going to be in trouble uh I think we're doing great I'm believing in this yeah dude crazy
[232:11.19]I've never heard you sound like that, Sterk.
[232:13.43]What?
[232:13.63]Yeah, dude.
[232:14.17]I've never heard you sound like that.
[232:16.76]Yeah, dude.
[232:17.58]Bruh, come on.
[232:19.90]Alright, stay away from the VTuber.
[232:24.80]No.
[232:25.76]There's just so many great out of context clips from the stream.
[232:35.04]Uh, I'm not kidding.
[232:36.36]The V-Tuber taunt thing is actually amazing.
[232:40.68]I may have accidentally, like, sky-murder nuked her.
[232:45.39]I'm dead again.
[232:49.65]Ugh, I'm such an asshole.
[232:51.17]I'm sorry.
[232:51.53]I got too close.
[232:52.39]I flew too close to the sun.
[232:53.55]I tried to C4 the V-Tuber.
[232:56.99]If I rez, I might die.
[232:58.11]I'm gonna go for it.
[232:59.21]I'm gonna go for it.
[233:02.45]Wait, is there a heal anywhere?
[233:07.82]Oh, please don't.
[233:13.60]I very much like this gun.
[233:16.31]You're doing the move that, like, Miquella does in the second phase.
[233:21.97]Oh, did you beat the DLC yet, Jerm?
[233:24.77]Yeah.
[233:25.71]The shadow.
[233:26.59]I used a giant piece of cement versus a god, and I won.
[233:31.64]I'm telling you, cement is the theme tonight.
[233:33.30]I'm using a finger.
[233:37.34]And then poke can go... Did you kill her, Dan?
[233:42.34]Did you get to the end?
[233:43.84]No, not yet.
[233:44.38]I have about maybe one or two streams of it left.
[233:47.48]But I'm getting real close.
[233:48.84]I did a lot of stuff.
[233:50.88]Loving it, by the way.
[233:51.60]It's so good.
[233:52.60]Spoiler.
[233:53.24]Did I just spoil the game for you?
[233:54.82]No, I didn't.
[233:59.01]Alright, where the fuck is Poe?
[234:06.33]Star, Surge, or Dan?
[234:07.31]The guy that rides on the horse?
[234:08.17]Where you fight him and the fucking Kaelin?
[234:13.10]He rides around and he does gravity magic at you.
[234:17.70]Yeah, you gotta do him to get to the DLC, right?
[234:19.92]He has to die for the DLC to be playable.
[234:23.64]Yeah, he's asking for thermal.
[234:26.88]I already know, man.
[234:30.90]You're like doing this pageantry for my benefit.
[234:33.12]And I'm like, yeah, I know.
[234:35.96]Poke, I do appreciate that was some backup right there.
[234:39.04]That was sick.
[234:39.68]Monstrous backup.
[234:41.34]Yeah, man.
[234:50.27]I think I ran into a whole group that was just like hanging out.
[234:55.07]Group.
[235:02.94]Why is this guy leaned over?
[235:04.06]I have like a, like an NPC soldier just leaning over me, looking thirstily at my character.
[235:09.54]Well, no, not the ground.
[235:10.56]Nevermind.
[235:12.88]Oh, come on.
[235:13.68]Really?
[235:14.04]I was behind the wall.
[235:18.38]Just you and uh, focus just you and Ster.
[235:23.02]I need to find a heal.
[235:27.24]Yeah.
[235:28.60]The sound was so loud.
[235:29.78]Explosion like static.
[235:34.58]I said you always die.
[235:35.66]Yeah, I'm a Ranger.
[235:36.58]That's what we do.
[235:38.30]We get up there and we start attacking him.
[235:40.84]I don't have any escapes.
[235:41.80]I can't run away.
[235:42.48]I'm just a guy.
[235:46.38]We're thinning the horde, Jerry.
[235:49.72]I think I can raise you with this much life.
[235:58.27]I'm going to try to just... I have like a sniper rifle, so I'm going to try to...
[236:03.60]kite and just like hit when I can you're the only character that can run yeah well running is an honest you want to run past that guy right here dude whoever just saved me thank you holy crap dude I'm on one there's another way on one there there really is another way oh god
[236:32.51]Should have brought them grenades again, the healing grenades.
[236:37.09]I just gotta be the team medic, you know what I mean?
[236:38.93]Like, I really gotta, like, fall into that role.
[236:42.75]You do.
[236:43.59]Step up, dude.
[236:45.53]I'll try.
[236:45.97]We went over our comps before the stream.
[236:48.27]I did not think I was going to see you playing Fencer, I will say.
[236:54.82]I wanted to try it.
[236:59.40]I do like it.
[237:01.55]I think it's better than all its other versions.
[237:04.11]Are we at as much health as we can get to?
[237:07.53]Yeah, do we have a heal?
[237:09.96]I don't have any heals, I'm sorry.
[237:11.32]Unless, hopefully this is a giant health box.
[237:13.72]No, it is a weapon.
[237:17.58]God, this rifle's so shit for this.
[237:21.09]Probably be good against ants, but not these guys.
[237:23.89]I wish I had two of these, man.
[237:36.91]I don't have great range this time, but it's alright.
[237:50.16]What the f... You just blew by me on my screen.
[237:55.06]Is anyone else's sound breaking or is it just me?
[237:56.96]Yep.
[237:57.48]Yeah, certainly.
[237:58.40]Certainly.
[237:58.72]Okay.
[237:59.04]Okay.
[237:59.42]That was crazy.
[238:00.10]Is it?
[238:05.44]That sounds normal to me.
[238:07.80]I mean, it's loud.
[238:09.12]I wonder where it's coming from.
[238:14.94]Sounds like broken headphones.
[238:18.24]I can't get a single shot off.
[238:27.42]Hey, hey, your headphones are about to break.
[238:31.71]I only shot one.
[238:32.49]That was a huge health kit right next to me here.
[238:44.08]Nobody should grab it.
[238:51.96]I'm very slowly just tearing my way through like a couple dudes, and it's all I can really do right now.
[238:56.99]Look at the healing rose.
[238:57.89]Massive... She's singing?
[238:59.95]Yeah, she's doing her whole performance.
[239:04.01]I'm sure the enemies are like, let's go find out what that is.
[239:09.04]I also hear... Maybe I'm incorrect.
[239:13.94]Pick up box.
[239:15.38]Box is... Oh, we got another one.
[239:20.36]Oh, shit.
[239:20.88]There is another one.
[239:22.22]I just saw a heal disappear.
[239:23.94]Unless one of you guys picked up.
[239:25.06]Oh, but we might be desynced.
[239:26.20]I think it was me.
[239:28.74]There's a million mouse turns to get back to where I was.
[239:41.12]Dead.
[239:41.76]I want to reload that.
[239:43.66]Loot gap.
[239:44.00]Loot gap.
[239:47.41]she sings the EDF song defending bother Earth from any alien attack not that one I don't know the rest so right arrow shout sing and then you get more no I wanted to use my voice oh I'm trying to practice
[240:16.99]I've got this job where I talk all day and I just want to get good at it.
[240:21.33]What kind of job is that?
[240:25.21]Alright, they're surrounding us.
[240:26.43]Pull it back.
[240:30.30]Get your head screwed on straight.
[240:34.58]Fall back if you need to.
[240:36.02]I've got a V-Tuber.
[240:36.90]We're good.
[240:41.44]Man, these charged swords actually do no damage.
[240:45.12]They take so long.
[240:52.99]How did that go over your head?
[240:54.33]I am so confused.
[240:57.03]What?
[240:57.53]And how did I get hurt?
[240:58.23]It takes so long for me to kill one of these things.
[241:02.37]Yeah.
[241:02.83]Yeah, I just brought the wrong weapons.
[241:05.05]There's health over here, but I cannot get it.
[241:08.73]I will die if I try to get it.
[241:15.83]I thought I could shoot him.
[241:17.60]Oh no.
[241:21.92]Calm down, boys.
[241:30.97]Only one of those hit?
[241:32.01]I have one health.
[241:33.79]I can't go over there.
[241:35.35]I can get you maybe, but I probably will have one health if you're okay with that.
[241:40.07]There's a health kit near my body.
[241:41.95]I'll be right there.
[241:43.97]On the other side of the street, use the crosswalk.
[241:47.79]Okay.
[241:49.44]Did you see it?
[241:50.16]The red circle across the screen.
[241:53.48]Farting on my roommate's door.
[241:57.10]Oh, it disappeared.
[241:58.02]Damn it.
[241:59.16]I got it.
[241:59.44]It's just that we're desynced, I guess.
[242:02.07]Oh, okay.
[242:02.59]Yeah, we are.
[242:03.97]Liv, I didn't.
[242:05.05]Those are good talking words.
[242:12.91]There is a lot coming over to you guys right now.
[242:22.18]You could have used the V-Tuber.
[242:24.38]Yeah, I should have.
[242:27.92]How come you're missing every shot?
[242:29.50]This is a Stampede M1.
[242:31.06]It's not supposed to be accurate.
[242:32.34]It's supposed to just spray missiles in every direction.
[242:37.34]Good cover.
[242:40.56]Yeah, I'll try it.
[242:42.42]Oh, shit.
[242:43.78]I think it's over.
[242:44.48]I don't know about this one.
[242:47.80]No, dogs.

[243:20.93]I don't know if I'll die from it.
[243:22.15]I might die, but... Vinny, you ready?
[243:26.67]Yeah, I'm ready.
[243:29.03]God, you were massively de-synced.
[243:30.73]Holy shit.
[243:33.23]No, I can't die here.
[243:40.68]Oh, fuck.
[243:41.96]No!

[244:38.77]Oh, fuck.
[244:43.43]Oh, no.
[244:44.55]We're just running in this direction.
[244:46.35]Hopefully there's no wall.
[244:47.07]I might be able to get you, Poke.
[244:48.33]I think I could get you.
[244:49.25]I'm going to have no health, but I don't care.
[244:51.03]I'm going to get you.
[244:52.83]Alright, Ster.
[244:54.53]I have Kiara.
[244:55.31]I can drop Kiara, and we can get in there and fight.
[245:01.63]Alright, you ready?
[245:02.85]Alright.
[245:03.53]Taunt incoming.
[245:04.41]Alright, get in.
[245:07.63]I mean, I don't want to be in.
[245:09.51]Well, just get over here.
[245:12.76]Well, there's time.
[245:17.40]They're ignoring her.
[245:19.76]Sir, there was time now.
[245:25.98]Gotcha.
[245:27.54]You were so far on my screen.
[245:28.92]I was really far.
[245:29.66]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[245:30.58]We're, like, massively distinct, I saw earlier.
[245:33.18]I'm trying to help you, Jerry.
[245:37.16]I think we're doing okay, honestly.
[245:41.58]Yeah, I think we're cleaning up.
[245:51.59]Snap Rifle did more damage.
[245:54.55]Oh, God.
[245:54.95]That wouldn't be so bad.
[245:57.89]I knew I was going to get caught.
[245:59.83]No!
[246:04.12]Get away from me!
[246:04.62]That was so dumb.
[246:11.76]No!
[246:12.20]Okay, I'm running.
[246:13.89]What the fuck?
[246:14.47]There's one right here.
[246:15.21]Oh, there might be health over here.
[246:26.26]Is this health?
[246:27.38]I hope it is.
[246:28.00]Shit.
[246:29.63]It's armor.
[246:35.33]Ster, I don't think I can revive you.
[246:37.41]Yeah, you can.
[246:38.79]Can I?
[246:39.19]Will it kill me?
[246:39.71]Yeah, do it.
[246:40.19]Yeah, do it.
[246:41.63]Oh, you want me to sacrifice myself for you?
[246:44.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[246:45.12]Please.
[246:45.58]Please.
[246:46.42]Oh, so you're good.
[246:46.96]I'm good.
[246:52.50]Trying to game chat.
[246:53.60]Holy shit.
[246:57.87]You good?
[247:05.37]I gotta get in there.
[247:06.15]If I get the shotgun close enough, I will be able to kill somebody, but I have no help.
[247:14.32]We're cleaning up one by one.
[247:18.30]I gotta get out of this.
[247:19.10]There's people behind me and in front of me.
[247:26.26]ah damn it I didn't get away is their torso their weak spot I don't know chat what do you what's what's the consensus here this is definitely the last wave so we can just get through it would be fine there's like one left just just get the boxes yeah I think we have to be super desynced I can't tell where anyone is eye and brain okay confirmed uh there's another wave
[247:56.89]it looks like their heads are armored and once you open it then you get brain there is help over here got the accuracy oh you actually are on the outside of the whole map I see who Vinny he's got the wikipedia open on his monitor he's just checking behind a building
[248:23.12]nice nice nice nice yeah
[248:47.09]Okay, yeah, that's probably, and for my sniper rifle, that's better.
[248:50.29]I thought the torsos were getting blown up quicker, but yeah, you're right.
[248:55.79]Okay, so there is another group, I guess, a small group.
[249:00.59]How?
[249:00.97]The game's just taunting us because we can't kill these fast enough.
[249:09.93]Okay.
[249:16.23]Yeah, I see him.
[249:17.83]It's a howl.
[249:19.41]Someone said, when I grow up, I want to be a torso.
[249:23.16]Alright.
[249:24.00]The oblongs?
[249:26.16]Oh, yeah.
[249:29.16]With the chemical spill.
[249:32.60]People waving up on the hill.
[249:34.34]Something like that, right?
[249:37.90]I don't know.
[249:38.32]Which, like I said, I didn't need to reply to that then.
[249:46.19]The oblongs.
[249:46.93]That's the intro.
[249:49.98]I know of oblongs.
[249:52.94]I've heard of these.
[249:57.84]Whoops.
[250:00.22]Well, two buildings with one stone.
[250:02.25]Oh boy, I was using that cover.
[250:05.27]My bad.
[250:08.57]It's now getting scary.
[250:14.71]Man, if I had two of these, this would be going a lot quicker.
[250:18.92]Oh!
[250:20.78]Oh no, Poke, I just... Oh, I'm coming.
[250:23.80]They snuck up on the building.
[250:24.96]I had no idea.
[250:32.69]This has got to be the end of the mission, right?
[250:34.13]I mean... I would imagine so.
[250:37.31]Alright, what side are you on?
[250:46.68]I don't even fuck with this map there you go oh shit watch out oh well I turned the corner and died did my thing blow you up?
[250:57.09]I don't think so that might be the last one oh shit I shot a rocket at it still alive okay it was dead now
[251:15.94]We did it.
[251:17.80]Unbelievable.
[251:19.56]That just took forever.
[251:24.01]That was challenging.
[251:24.95]It was like six minutes.
[251:27.19]We got all the loot, I'm pretty sure.
[251:33.29]Yeah, we were pretty good with the loot.
[251:37.46]I'm not choosing the sniper rifle for missions like this anymore, chat.
[251:40.16]Yeah, that was awful.
[251:46.40]oh loot I got I got a bike oh the motorcycle I yeah they're funny they're very funny if we can use them I got the ad booster
[252:04.03]Yeah.
[252:04.27]Okay.
[252:04.45]So Vinny, I just got an air tortoise upgrade and the lock on time is now 10 seconds instead of 13.
[252:08.19]Okay.
[252:08.61]Getting there.
[252:11.31]So maybe like by the time you get to the end of the game, it might even be like five.
[252:19.73]I, uh, lads, I do kind of have some bad news.
[252:22.34]I'm not going to be playing that much more.
[252:25.26]Maybe like one more mission, if that's okay.
[252:27.22]We've been going for like four hours and 15.
[252:29.62]Oh my God.
[252:30.14]We haven't played for four hours.

[253:57.05]Okay.
[254:06.18]It's like... I love how divided everybody is.

[255:09.96]Do we even know?
[255:10.50]Okay.
[255:11.04]It's probably more of those robots.
[255:12.40]You're bringing a fish?
[255:14.16]You got a herring?
[255:16.86]I can't decide on what to bring.
[255:23.26]It says super-sized invaders have just shown up.
[255:26.10]Their bodies are as big as their attitudes.
[255:28.50]You can't let your guard down against them.
[255:30.36]There might be a new enemy that's even bigger.
[255:35.00]I'm bringing the air toward us for this one.
[255:40.32]Do you guys have any of the lock-on weapons that need an air Raider?
[255:44.46]Or is that just me?
[255:45.42]I don't think yet.
[255:47.14]I think I'll get some of those at some point, maybe.
[255:52.86]Okay.
[255:54.40]Stork and grant rockets.
[255:56.00]I do like the grant rockets.
[255:58.78]Oh, just a regular grant rocket, but it's level zero.
[256:01.78]Minion buster.
[256:02.36]I'll try it.
[256:03.49]Alright, I'll try it.
[256:04.35]Why not?
[256:06.17]Which was your favorite Minion movie?
[256:08.95]Never watched them.
[256:10.63]Oh, okay.
[256:12.99]Should I?
[256:13.95]Which one?
[256:14.47]Oh, I know which one I like.
[256:18.75]There's four of them, right?
[256:23.72]And there's Penguins of Madagascar, which is kind of a spin-off.
[256:28.38]Giant android sighted.
[256:32.64]Oh, you can't jump with two of these?
[256:35.36]Okay.
[256:36.32]Chat, how do you use the bike?
[256:39.30]Okay, I think you have to call for it, which I think is Z. Okay, bad news.
[256:46.70]I think, yeah, this is a new enemy and they just have bigger heads.
[256:56.06]Oh my god, chat.
[256:57.98]Oh my god.
[257:02.33]180 damage are you that hurt that was actually kind of worth it and the bike is dead knocks them down maybe let's go how much health
[257:31.44]That's a pretty good tactic right there.
[257:34.14]Dude, why do these do no damage?
[257:44.83]Miss every shot with the rocket.
[257:46.15]That's fine.
[257:47.05]This thing takes forever?
[257:48.13]Yeah.
[257:48.63]I mean, it's the air tortoise, man.
[257:54.28]It's upgraded.
[257:54.90]It's 10 seconds now.
[257:55.86]It's at a 13.
[257:56.56]Okay, guys.
[257:58.04]Cover ears.
[258:03.43]That actually breaks the game.
[258:05.51]That's two of them at once, so maybe a bit louder.
[258:08.57]Alright, I'm throwing Gura.
[258:15.74]Gura has been deployed.
[258:19.94]Dude, I like the air toward us here.
[258:21.42]It's like a dubstep weapon.
[258:28.59]When it shoots at you, the thing was like... That was crazy.
[258:32.44]That was awesome.
[258:33.72]That was some sick dubstep.
[258:37.34]Yo, keep playing that.
[258:44.52]Sorry, never mind.
[258:47.66]Here it is.
[258:56.31]He does not want to get hit by that rock.
[258:58.18]Oh my God.
[258:58.80]I think it feels less loud to me because I know when they're going to happen.
[259:08.20]I think things are going well.
[259:15.50]Manages to avoid every shot.
[259:26.51]David, how much health do these things have?
[259:30.00]These are quite massive enemies.
[259:37.52]If anyone's around, I could use a revive.
[259:41.26]I'm going to come rev you up.
[259:44.32]Yeah, I have a bike.
[259:52.65]Thank you.
[259:55.30]Oh my God, die you mother.
[259:57.72]What the hell that rocket launcher chat is like not even close to worth it at this point.
[260:01.86]It's doing something what?
[260:03.98]Space spaceship lit up.
[260:05.31]Oh we got mother ships coming in.
[260:06.95]There goes one.
[260:17.08]Here we go.
[260:17.44]Yeah, what it is.
[260:20.12]It is doing something.
[260:20.86]What is it doing?
[260:27.16]Oh, did it open a portal and is now bringing in more forces?
[260:30.79]I think so.
[260:32.21]Okay, we're getting the Star Trek ships.
[260:35.53]Something's coming in here.
[260:36.31]Let's see.
[260:37.15]What is this?
[260:38.55]It's like the way Dune operates.
[260:43.08]They make a little portal and go through it.
[260:55.35]Sorry, next time I'll face you towards the monster.
[261:00.17]Oh, they're leaving.
[261:01.05]No, they're all trying to leave.
[261:02.13]The portal from the expanse.
[261:05.23]Oh yeah, I can see that.
[261:07.27]This is scary.
[261:09.68]Remember those individual enemies we took like an hour to kill two of?
[261:13.08]Here's like 15.
[261:18.64]No, there's some more soldiers.
[261:23.58]You guys hear that?
[261:24.72]Yeah.
[261:25.10]It's also so good.
[261:25.80]They got to ask him more.
[261:27.54]Oh, yeah.
[261:28.60]I want you to send me the recipe because I actually want to make it.
[261:31.40]Okay, I will.
[261:32.24]You got to send me like and I want every video.
[261:35.00]Yeah.
[261:35.22]Alright.
[261:38.38]Yeah, this weird guy on YouTube ripped them off.
[261:40.42]It's called like folks world famous salsa.
[261:44.21]But like somebody did a cover of it.
[261:47.24]I'm sorry, I couldn't hear anything.
[261:48.18]A car drove into my living room.
[261:49.50]What'd you say?
[261:50.92]I'm not going to say it again.
[261:51.96]I'm not going to replay the same sound bit for my chat four times.
[261:57.50]You've been doing it for the last two hours.
[262:01.09]I have?
[262:05.89]This bike is not working out for me, chat.
[262:10.05]Yeah, you've been playing a sound effect in our ears for a couple hours, too.
[262:15.86]There was one mission.
[262:16.82]This is the second mission.
[262:20.84]Where's the bike?
[262:23.32]You want it?
[262:23.86]Please take it.
[262:24.44]I don't fucking want it anymore.
[262:26.36]It is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[262:29.75]When you get off the bike, does it despawn?
[262:32.77]You might have, like, sent it... It...
[262:38.01]It blew up.
[262:38.89]Oh, oh, oops.
[262:41.11]I'll get you a bike later, don't worry.
[262:45.63]They're too tanky.
[262:51.91]And like the whole time we're doing this, I'm just hearing like VTuber noises in my right ear and I'm like, what the fuck am I playing?
[263:03.96]Only the best game ever.
[263:08.56]game is busted.
[263:09.55]Yeah, I don't know.
[263:11.31]It sounds like you guys became believers.
[263:17.25]We gotta find one believers or not.
[263:20.19]I'm believing in this game.
[263:21.31]I think it's really fun.
[263:24.62]Did I bomb you?
[263:25.48]Very, very addictive.
[263:26.30]No.
[263:31.78]I died from the dubstep gun.
[263:36.14]I'm going to try and go get yoke.
[263:41.18]I might be able to get poke up.
[263:42.32]I just need to kill this one last dude because this one's guarding the body.
[263:47.28]There's only like four left.
[263:48.30]This is very manageable.
[263:50.44]Yeah.
[263:53.18]Vinny, does this feel any different than EDF 5 or 4?
[263:56.23]The differences are quite pronounced.
[263:59.15]The previous games had a slight... I never played them.
[264:04.91]don't know how to answer that please please please do not kill me I died when I spawned sorry it's definitely different these are enemies that were not in the last game I don't remember they always have new enemies in general so it's pretty similar I'd say the weird grunge texture and everything's a little different but uh it's kind of like just more nine inch nails album cover across every texture in the game
[264:32.04]When you get EDF, you kind of know what you're getting into.
[264:34.28]It's just it's EDF.
[264:36.36]That's it.
[264:40.86]It does sound like dubstep.
[264:48.67]It sounds actually pretty good.
[264:52.41]Me or the... I mean both.
[264:54.89]I didn't even really try.
[265:04.47]These sound effects.
[265:06.73]Damn it.
[265:07.13]I threw the decoy, too, and it still wasn't enough to get the attention off of me.
[265:18.33]I'm coming to res.
[265:22.63]What?
[265:23.13]Yeah, nice.
[265:24.31]Oh.
[265:25.49]That was amazing on my screen poke.
[265:27.23]You have no idea how insane that was.
[265:30.02]What would it look like?
[265:31.77]Like, you were just rocketing towards me, and then you just died.
[265:34.54]Oh, okay.
[265:35.44]You just ragdolled right next to me.
[265:39.90]I gave up all my life.
[265:42.10]I gave up all my life.
[265:42.96]I am slowly making my way over to the two of you, but I cannot guarantee I will make it in time.
[265:47.47]I don't think you even have the life to res them.
[265:50.65]I did not make it in time.
[265:53.67]I did kill one, though.
[265:57.73]Sure, you just have to deal with three.
[266:00.43]I believe in Ster.
[266:02.81]They're pretty wounded.
[266:05.97]What is different in the last game?
[266:11.23]Different type of weapons, different enemies, different scenarios, different... This is very the same, just like a lot of stuff added and different enemies.
[266:24.59]Are the graphics better at all?
[266:26.39]No, I say they're better because they're a little bit less like
[266:31.51]messy and dirty because they went with like a full dirty Earth but the graphics are about the same besides that it's funny if you if you were shown a couple images of edf3 through six it actually might be hard for you to know even which one is which yeah if it was like guess which one I don't think you'd guess
[266:58.53]I think this is the last guy.
[266:59.89]No, there's some other... Someone asked, is this game better than Helldivers?
[267:03.96]I'm going to say it.
[267:05.32]Yes.
[267:06.02]Got him!
[267:07.36]Yes.
[267:09.68]EDF is... It can convert you.
[267:14.58]It can make you a believer out of you.
[267:16.14]Especially when you get later.
[267:16.82]Helldivers is cool, but there's not enough weapons for me.
[267:20.21]You know what I mean?
[267:21.07]Yeah, there's new weapons every mission.
[267:23.63]Yeah, that's cool.
[267:24.63]That's what I wanted.
[267:26.05]And the random element gives you a lot of, like, dopamine, too.
[267:30.41]Of, like, what's your weapon going to be like?
[267:32.50]Somebody said it.
[267:33.30]Somebody said it's good.
[267:33.84]This is OG.
[267:34.74]This is, like, an OG game.
[267:36.30]This is, like, one of those.
[267:38.88]This thing was, you were slaying monsters in this game, fighting waves and waves of bugs.
[267:44.00]Back when half this chat was in diapers, alright?
[267:46.11]Oof.
[267:46.91]Oof.
[267:47.67]He said it, not me.
[267:48.57]Yeah.
[267:50.51]This is, like, a 20-year-old franchise.
[267:52.13]Yeah.
[267:57.05]Oh my god, Ster, you lived.
[267:59.47]Which one?
[268:00.93]Get poke.
[268:02.71]Yo.
[268:04.74]Somebody in my chat said, why are we catching strays?
[268:08.98]Yeah, like that.
[268:10.54]Hey guys, yeah, I really like EDF.
[268:12.43]You guys are babies.
[268:19.43]it's so funny because I think like like everybody loves this game like no there's nobody in the chat right now going like this sucks bro everybody loves this I don't think anybody hates this game truly oh there's uh yeah there's definitely okay well they're all they're all gonna like put their hands up now you mentioned the price you mentioned the price it might say something
[268:44.71]Yeah, it's a little expensive.
[268:46.21]Are they all in your chat, Vinny?
[268:48.10]Are they all saying that they don't like it?
[268:50.12]No, there's a couple here and there, but also, you never know.
[268:52.68]People are just saying things to say things.
[268:54.66]But, Jerma, I just rode my bike, glitched off of it, hit a thing, got off of it, ragdolled, and then the bike exploded.
[269:03.69]That's what the bike's for.
[269:04.65]Aren't you glad you used a slot for that?
[269:10.55]yeah this I'm really happy about that yeah can't other people ride the bike with you too Ster is that accurate just be able to any vehicle you call in anybody can use and some of the bikes have like the funny little third person seat
[269:36.37]playing it's like just vtubers on my screen at every moment which that's by the way why the chat in my chat is is complaining that's like like one of the sole reasons for some people yep yep they're here to take much give us they're here to give us they're recruiting us I know soon Jerma I'm gonna end up you know
[270:06.88]I'm gonna be Watto, my Watto tuber.
[270:10.97]You know who Watto is, right?
[270:12.51]Oh, I love Watto, yeah.
[270:13.73]I love your Watto, by the way.
[270:15.99]Thanks, buddy.
[270:17.49]Yeah, I have a Watto 3D model I use, and I might just join an agency and get a manager as Watto.
[270:23.78]What is a Watto?
[270:24.54]And sue the real Watto.
[270:26.78]What's up, sir?
[270:27.88]What's a Watto?
[270:30.75]Annie, it's me, Watto!
[270:33.88]Dear chupidenaria, Annie, do you want to be in the Star Wars movie with me, Annie?
[270:38.54]That guy.
[270:39.12]So, Italian Vegeta?
[270:40.92]I got a voice, too.
[270:42.74]I don't even know what that is.
[270:44.58]What do we have?
[270:47.93]Jeremy, you had a voice?
[270:48.99]Sorry, that was only from my chat.
[270:50.43]I'm trying to get as many people to leave as possible.
[270:52.93]Oh.
[270:55.13]I played that fucking clip of me doing the voice again.
[271:01.54]Oh, he doesn't usually snort.
[271:02.54]I snort laughter at that, yeah.
[271:06.66]Did you mute us to play it?
[271:08.30]No, no, I'm here.
[271:12.43]Alright, I think I'm gonna bounce.
[271:13.93]Wait, this is the mission 13.
[271:15.19]This is the big one.
[271:16.11]This is the super mission?
[271:18.39]Yeah, Vinny, you gotta do one more, Vinny.
[271:20.85]You can use your tank in this mission?
[271:22.39]Oh, I can't still.
[271:25.38]This is the big one, the boss battle.
[271:27.02]This is the boss battle?
[271:28.30]This looks like a boss battle.
[271:32.15]It's gonna be because this is one like everything unlocks.
[271:34.61]This is the story beat.
[271:36.47]OK, the Super Bowl.
[271:40.67]I'll bring healing.
[271:41.47]I'll bring healing.
[271:50.98]We got a level 8 grant.
[271:54.54]That's choice.
[271:55.14]What am I picking?
[272:07.94]I'll just keep... The stork is good.
[272:09.26]Okay, I'm just gonna keep making the noise.
[272:15.08]If that's okay.
[272:16.30]Honestly, I would probably start missing it if it wasn't there.
[272:18.74]I think I'm so used to it now.
[272:20.74]God, his loadout sucks.
[272:24.03]That guy probably has like 5,000 hours.
[272:25.29]Should I get a long-range weapon?
[272:33.75]I have a... Yeah, I've got a rocket.
[272:36.18]I've got a gun.
[272:41.04]There might be some air.
[272:45.02]This is like a spacecraft thing.
[272:46.96]Don't forget to bring long-range weapons.
[272:49.02]You'll need them, it says.
[272:50.71]Okay.
[272:52.81]Alright.
[272:53.19]That's the case.
[272:56.25]So maybe I don't bring the grant this time.
[273:04.93]Grant is long-range.
[273:06.15]That's what I thought.
[273:14.05]This thing was good.
[273:14.55]I'll use this.
[273:16.64]Okay.
[273:18.24]I'm ready for the ultimate.
[273:20.20]Okay, this mission's called The Big Day.
[273:22.50]Well, it's my birthday, so that must be what they're talking about.
[273:36.09]Yeah.
[273:45.45]Can you please play Roblox next stream?
[273:47.37]Oh my God.
[273:48.39]Well, we don't demand things here, so no.
[273:55.24]Oh, it's the squids.
[273:56.50]Okay, I hope I can hit them.
[274:03.14]The communication thing is so weird.
[274:05.68]Ask vague questions?
[274:08.52]Oh yeah.
[274:12.36]What's your purpose?
[274:14.64]What's your purpose?
[274:19.72]Did they want you to have full communications in like a VGS system?
[274:22.92]Like, how are you going to have like a weird session like this where you're... Hey, tell me your like innermost thoughts, like through VGS.
[274:28.91]Okay, I guess I can hit him.
[274:33.79]Well, those are fun to blow up.
[274:35.63]Ooh.
[274:36.49]Aim for the middle of the drone.
[274:37.77]Shoot the ball in the center.
[274:48.87]That's awesome.
[274:49.95]I love blowing these things up.
[274:51.27]It's so good.
[274:55.81]Yeah, these things are actually pretty cool to fight.
[274:58.49]If we destroy the pylons, they can't build more.
[275:01.69]You must create additional pylons.
[275:03.95]The sniper rifle range is ridiculous.
[275:08.47]I may have just aggroed like 10 things accidentally because I'm shooting so far away.
[275:18.17]There's a slight deviation, though.
[275:25.88]Did you shoot me?
[275:28.48]Who did that?
[275:32.04]I can hear their volume, their voice.
[275:41.34]I also have this anti-aircraft mine that I'm going to mess with and see what that's like.
[275:50.45]I would assume it's not just like only one and they respawn.
[275:54.62]I hope or yeah recharge.
[276:00.76]Is it like 30 times less health than the babies?
[276:03.34]Oh, you got it.
[276:08.25]Damn.
[276:09.71]Nobody is laying him out.
[276:15.57]That's speak of the devil.
[276:16.87]It's baby time.
[276:19.87]Oh God, I hate these motherfuckers.
[276:27.43]175 damage in the head is actually not bad, but it's not great either.
[276:30.38]This brand is awesome.
[276:35.56]It's doing it.
[276:36.14]It's doing a lot of damage now.
[276:37.84]I'm really happy with this choice.
[276:45.91]Take it down to the defeat.
[276:59.74]It's a little too quiet.
[277:00.94]You know what I mean?
[277:01.44]I think we're just gaming.
[277:08.02]We talked about eggs and toast and cereal characters.
[277:10.96]We're good.
[277:11.72]We've filled the quota.
[277:15.90]Oh, there's a lot of ships up ahead.
[277:18.18]See you guys next month.
[277:19.02]Yeah, man.
[277:21.00]Yeah.
[277:26.31]Poke, I saw you play the part of the Blade & Sorcery update.
[277:31.57]Oh yeah.
[277:32.96]It was so funny.
[277:34.90]Was it fun?
[277:36.26]Dude, we can do VR.
[277:37.72]We can do co-op with that.
[277:39.74]Is there co-op for Blade & Sorcery?
[277:41.58]Yeah, can we all do it?
[277:42.64]Come on.
[277:43.96]I play it.
[277:44.66]I played it once on stream.
[277:45.98]It's awesome.
[277:46.66]I would dig my VR headset out of the attic to play that if we all played it.
[277:54.06]My chat's saying there isn't co-op.
[277:56.58]No, there's a mod that's apparently really good.
[277:58.86]No, no, no, no.
[278:00.20]I just got disconnected from the session.
[278:02.12]I got disconnected.
[278:04.00]I don't know why.
[278:05.94]How long ago?
[278:07.78]Just now.
[278:08.80]Yeah, me too.
[278:10.38]I'm still in the game.
[278:12.30]It's up to me to defend Earth.
[278:14.16]Yeah, my crates.
[278:15.44]My crates.
[278:18.38]That sucks.
[278:20.62]Are you freaking serious right now?
[278:24.56]oh guys at 100 level 109 aliens attacked oh wow yeah you can so is it only you in the game right now Jerma uh I just got kicked out too oh cool weird I don't have my mouse in the game uh am I making it again or just vinny is that it did that really end it for you I don't know
[278:55.75]I mean, that one was taking a while.
[278:57.93]That's gonna be a long one.
[278:58.97]That's gonna be like a 25-minute mission.
[279:01.29]Yeah, I think I have to bounce.
[279:04.10]Okay.
[279:04.68]Okay, Buster.
[279:05.90]Sorry.
[279:07.44]I mean, I tried, but, you know.
[279:10.40]Hey, that was a lot of fun.
[279:12.68]EDF is awesome.
[279:13.52]I would definitely play it again.
[279:14.64]There's more people that we could probably play with, too.
[279:16.48]Whoever people want to play, we can get, like, fucking... Let's get, like, a 15-person Lethal Company lobby again.
[279:23.79]but it's a four player game also well I mean I'm down to play on a future occasion um I I could I could try again to play we absolutely just hit the period where the game essentially just begun if you actually like it and you really want to play it um we can just play I'm cool just playing it whatever
[279:49.78]How about this?
[279:50.24]How about this?
[279:50.54]You guys ready?
[279:51.62]Yeah.
[279:52.72]Game night again.
[279:54.68]We figure out the day when we can.
[279:57.03]Nope, nope.
[279:57.75]Rush right now, but it'll happen soon.
[279:59.83]And we just play Worms.
[280:02.89]And if Worms burns out and we're here and we're chilling, let's play some more Earth Defense.
[280:08.19]Unless we've got another idea.
[280:09.75]That sounds great.
[280:10.67]Next weekend, same time.
[280:12.64]Okay.
[280:14.32]Well, depending on this busy boy.
[280:17.62]It's Monday.
[280:19.74]I'm good for Monday next week.
[280:21.10]I have no problem with that at all, actually.
[280:24.48]Just saying.
[280:25.92]Alright.
[280:26.48]Next week, Monday, Worms with the boys and EDF with the boys.
[280:29.67]If it happens, it happens, but let's do it.
[280:31.35]That sounds good to me.
[280:32.67]I'm good for it.
[280:33.39]I mean, yeah, but life gets in the way from time to time.
[280:35.95]But if it doesn't, then let's do it.
[280:38.15]If it doesn't happen, if it doesn't happen, it's okay.
[280:40.95]Just in case.
[280:42.09]Just in case.
[280:42.81]Hey, it's true, though.
[280:44.07]It's true.
[280:46.33]But yeah, this was great.
[280:48.03]Thanks for getting this all set up, Stirgerm.
[280:51.51]I really like this.
[280:52.77]And Poke, always good playing with you.
[280:55.53]Great time with you guys.
[280:56.85]Poke, did you post Sadam Hussein on Twitter?
[280:59.81]No.
[281:00.01]Okay, never mind.
[281:01.75]No?
[281:03.23]Wait, what?
[281:03.69]Why would I do that?
[281:05.95]No, because you had like... No, you posted like the guy laying down.
[281:10.89]You know what I mean?
[281:13.41]That's not Saddam.
[281:15.29]That's kind of Saddam, dude.
[281:17.24]It's a guy laying down.
[281:21.78]Wait, is it a meme I don't know about?
[281:22.98]It's a guy laying down.
[281:25.12]You don't know about the Saddam?
[281:26.22]Oh.
[281:26.80]It's a guy laying down with a boner.
[281:30.25]Oh, that's what that is?
[281:32.01]Why does this keep evolving?
[281:34.19]Why does this keep evolving?
[281:34.84]What the hell is Saddam Hussein?
[281:39.86]I'll show you.
[281:40.40]Hang on.
[281:41.76]Don't make me play.
[281:42.28]I don't want to rush you guys or anything, but you have to listen.
[281:46.63]Tom Hanks' voice is coming up.
[281:47.77]Oh, I see it.
[281:49.15]Saddam's hiding place.
[281:50.45]This is his hiding place.
[281:56.19]Alright, I'm sorry.
[281:57.29]I just ruined the end of this.
[281:58.45]I'm going to go now.
[282:00.89]Thanks, guys.
[282:01.41]I appreciate you all.
[282:02.45]Really, genuinely.
[282:03.19]Let's play again sometime.
[282:05.13]Now that's the kind of guy I want on my worms team.
[282:08.49]Maybe on Monday, but you know, sometimes things go wrong.
[282:10.57]I'm down.
[282:11.03]Life gets in the way, but I'm down.
[282:13.80]Alright.
[282:14.80]See you.
[282:15.28]See you, Vinny.
[282:16.26]Good to see you.
[282:17.50]You too.
[282:21.88]I guess my turn to leave.
[282:23.71]Okay.
[282:25.21]Hey, but hey, worms Monday.
[282:26.91]I'm down.
[282:29.81]Yeah.
[282:30.17]Alright.
[282:31.49]Where's Monday?
[282:32.81]And what was that other game like frog frog game?
[282:35.97]You just write them in the chat with the ideas where there was like a Frogger.
[282:39.67]Because we're gonna forget more like 10 minutes.
[282:45.80]Now I'll if I can, if I can think of anything, I'll put it in the chat.
[282:51.88]Okay, I think let's do something crazy weird.
[282:54.83]obscure well he said there was a whole bunch of like uh Lethal Company like I don't know if you want to go down that road edf5 just go down a version alright edf podcast alright how many alright how many views would an edf podcast get if that's all it was however how many people play the game
[283:20.51]Quite a lot, but for the rest of the time that any of us ever make any content, we just do an EDF podcast.
[283:26.85]And there's like 400 episodes.
[283:32.05]I mean, I'd be down, I guess.
[283:34.84]I kind of would, too.
[283:36.20]You know we wouldn't even give a fuck.
[283:37.48]We would just start talking about random stuff that has nothing to do with EDF.
[283:40.54]We just don't even talk about the game once.
[283:42.78]That's going to let down a lot of EDF fans.
[283:45.64]Yeah.
[283:46.48]Guys, like, man, can we stick to the topic?
[283:55.35]Alright, bros.
[283:56.19]I'll see you later.
[283:56.79]Thanks for playing.
[283:57.45]Good to see you guys.
[283:58.77]Love you guys.
[283:59.29]Bye.
[284:00.23]Have a great day.
[284:02.69]Those guys are great.
[284:07.05]If you're not watching any of those streamers stream, you are making a massive mistake.
[284:18.72]Just telling you.
[284:25.83]Yeah, that was EDF 6.
[284:28.11]We played it.
[284:28.93]It was fun.
[284:30.34]I love this game.
[284:30.94]It's a great just background game.
[284:33.58]Somebody said it pretty early on, but you just kind of shoot aliens and bugs and you can just kind of chill.
[284:38.68]Just talk about random dumb shit.
[284:42.49]I had a good time.
[284:43.01]Hope you guys did too.
[284:45.69]And that's going to be it.
[284:47.15]Yeah, that's it for now.
[284:53.02]So the next time you see me, we'll, I mean, seems like maybe next week we're going to play some worms or something.
[285:02.41]Please do the Tom Hanks thing one more time.
[285:05.57]No, there's only so many Bugleberry coins you get to use.
[285:09.23]And I'm not using a Bugleberry-esque coin on that one.
[285:22.82]You need to dress to impress.
[285:24.13]Let me know if you have any blade and sorcery questions.
[285:30.93]I moderate for the developers and make mods for it.
[285:33.60]Holy shit, really?
[285:34.44]Damn.
[285:37.22]I'm going to highlight your name.
[285:38.32]Because that actually sounds like fun.
[285:49.89]But we'll see.
[285:51.25]We'll see in the next week or so.
[285:53.04]We definitely are going to play at least Worms.
[285:54.42]I have to... The VR shit is just... You know when something sits in your closet for long enough and it's been so long that taking it out and getting it set up is such an ordeal even if you really want to do it.
[286:08.49]It's in a box and I think it's in this... It's in a series of three or four different boxes.
[286:15.63]It's like, I don't even know where the cords are.
[286:17.05]I mean, I could do it.
[286:18.41]I could definitely do it.
[286:19.21]It's just one of those things.
[286:19.92]You just have to get it set up.
[286:29.94]Are you going to stream on Miku's birthday?
[286:31.70]It's the 31st.
[286:35.73]I don't know.
[286:36.93]But, I mean, that's a huge deal.
[286:39.41]That is a massive day.
[286:48.67]Which, honestly, I'm surprised it's not a national holiday.
[286:50.81]Like, I'm a little upset about it.
[287:03.80]Alright, I will see you later.
[287:05.60]Thanks for watching.
[287:06.44]I don't know if Poke or Ster are still streaming.
[287:09.62]Or, I don't think Vinny was still streaming.
[287:11.12]But if Poke and Ster are still streaming... Go spread out.
[287:15.54]Go spread the joy.
[287:19.88]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[287:20.68]Thanks for watching.
[287:21.26]Take care of yourselves.
[287:22.20]See you guys soon.
[287:24.32]Keep an eye on the sus over the next week.
[287:26.89]I don't have a plan to stream in the next week.
[287:31.35]But, you never know.
[287:32.67]Maybe I'll get a Gazillionaire in me.
[287:35.87]I want to come and just hang out.
[287:38.69]Yeah, at the very least, I'll see you guys probably on Monday.
[287:41.57]Or Monday-ish, depending on when we can get everybody together.
[287:44.16]Take it easy.
[287:49.72]Have a great night.
[287:50.32]Call your mother.
[287:54.55]Goodbye.
[288:30.89]you
