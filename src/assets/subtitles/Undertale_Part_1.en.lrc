[00:05.81]The great papyrus!
[00:13.38]Uh-oh.
[00:17.54]Uh-oh.
[00:19.18]Why is this playing?
[00:21.10]What do I do?
[00:24.01]This is an undertale.
[00:28.87]Shut up!
[00:29.69]There we go.
[00:55.40]go to bed I just woke up yeah I don't know I don't know where the moon is I put that into I may have screwed it up because I put it in twice I don't know it's not 4 a.m.
[01:13.39]it's like 7 a.m.
[01:14.91]for me so I have to have a confession to make I've played this game for about two hours so far
[01:24.77]And I, uh... I've already done a few things.
[01:31.11]And I just was like, you know what?
[01:32.33]Why not just stream it?
[01:35.77]And it's like 9 degrees right now, or like 10 degrees.
[01:39.54]And I'm in this little box.
[01:41.44]This little ice box downstairs.
[01:45.40]So, like, this heater behind me.
[01:47.36]I don't have heat down in my basement, and I decided to put my office down here.
[01:52.46]That's a good plan.
[01:57.32]Yeah, I've already started as you'll see.
[02:00.70]See?
[02:00.90]I have about two hours in the game.
[02:07.65]So what I know about the game is it's kind of fun.
[02:12.43]It's interesting.
[02:13.37]This is my first time ever playing this game.
[02:16.23]So if you keep the spoilers out of chat, otherwise, banned!
[02:24.80]Just like that, you know what I mean?
[02:27.02]Although, this is my first time playing the game.
[02:31.62]I'll tell you what I've done so far.
[02:34.30]Here's what I've done so far.
[02:36.78]Uh, I killed... Wait, hold on a second.
[02:39.97]If you, like, don't want to know about this game, then just don't listen.
[02:43.91]Okay, there we go.
[02:46.09]Um... We got a subscriber.
[02:48.33]Oh, hey, welcome.
[02:49.85]KillKing73, welcome to King Christmas' fucking Christmas station.
[02:59.32]Um, uh, this is obviously, if you've never played Undertale, then just, what are you, what are you doing here?
[03:11.68]But anyways, uh, here's what I did so far.
[03:14.97]So don't be mad at me if I don't pay attention to the chat.
[03:19.75]Because if I look over and I see, like...
[03:22.51]Your father is the king of all and is sacred and you kill your own father and your father pees on you.
[03:26.81]Then like, I'm going to be mad, right?
[03:28.49]I'm going to get really pissed off.
[03:32.65]So, right, let's just play it.
[03:37.44]Here's what happened.
[03:38.20]I killed Toriel because I didn't understand what was happening.
[03:43.84]I thought the, I thought this, she was like, test me your strength.
[03:49.23]We will see if you're strong enough.
[03:50.83]So I killed her.
[03:52.42]That's what I thought it meant.
[03:54.10]I just, I did, RPG, I just, I killed her.
[03:57.66]Okay?
[03:58.58]So then I got, I figured out what was going on, I went further on.
[04:01.54]Uh, I met, uh, I met the great Papyrus!
[04:05.00]And he's, like, a really cool character.
[04:07.02]I let it, he's alive.
[04:09.48]He's alive.
[04:12.86]And that's where I said, I just did the Papyrus.
[04:15.49]I hope I'm saying that right.
[04:16.65]Please don't, like, burn me at the stake because I'm saying that wrong.
[04:19.63]Is it Papyrus or is it, like, Papyrus?
[04:22.93]This is my first run.
[04:23.97]Yes.
[04:27.07]So I have no idea where I'm going, what I'm doing.
[04:31.84]I'm just going to go.
[04:34.16]I don't know how long I'm going to stream this for.
[04:36.38]Maybe like an hour or two.
[04:44.62]Papyrus.
[04:46.75]Papyrus.
[04:49.31]It's not papyrus?
[04:51.13]Oh, that's too bad.
[04:53.19]All right, so I'm just going to do whatever I feel like doing, right?
[04:56.69]So if it's like, well, make sure you don't kill this character.
[04:59.34]Well, whatever.
[05:00.32]If I don't like him, then he's going to go.
[05:02.86]To be young again.
[05:05.92]The world sure felt boundless.
[05:09.73]Rock with a mustache.
[05:10.55]Cool.
[05:10.67]All right, I don't know where to go.
[05:13.11]The last thing I did, I was like dating Pappy Russ.
[05:17.05]It was the last thing that happened.
[05:22.17]Just throwing ice cubes into a lake, alright.
[05:24.00]I don't know what this is.
[05:44.04]I like- this game is interesting because it's just the cast of just weird characters.
[05:53.11]Do these people, like, mean anything?
[05:54.32]Like, I feel like these guys, like, I'm supposed to do something with these people, but we're just gonna go.
[06:01.12]I have been watching Awesome Dame... Awesome Dames Gone... What was I gonna say?
[06:05.14]Awesome Games Done Quick.
[06:08.16]Hold on a second.
[06:08.66]There's a little lighthouse here.
[06:10.53]It's locked from the inside.
[06:11.47]Okay.
[06:12.19]Let's go.
[06:13.49]There's been enough preface of this.
[06:17.57]It's called a lake, dumbass.
[06:20.65]It's getting kind of cold.
[06:22.71]Wait, didn't I already do this?
[06:26.91]Yeah, I did.
[06:27.32]Okay, this is where you fought.
[06:28.10]Okay, let's go.
[06:28.90]I gotta remember the buttons because it's been like a week since I've played.
[06:35.78]There's items.
[06:37.60]I got nice cream bandage, three cinnamon buns.
[06:43.35]Here's my stats.
[06:44.33]I don't know what... I'm holding a knife.
[06:47.01]I got a manly bandana.
[06:48.09]I got 45 gold.
[06:49.73]And I can call...
[06:52.10]Let's call papyrus.
[06:55.04]Ring ring.
[06:56.46]Waterfall!
[06:57.32]I barely know anything about it!
[06:58.88]But I'll do my best to inform you.
[07:02.14]Thank you.
[07:07.55]Those go up.
[07:08.81]Can I touch these little crystals?
[07:14.15]Ooh, different monsters.
[07:16.53]This is a starfish guy.
[07:17.52]No, not starfish.
[07:19.60]Seahorse.
[07:21.55]This is an echo flower.
[07:22.53]It repeats the last thing it heard over and over.
[07:28.03]Why is it not repeating it?
[07:30.17]Neat, huh?
[07:33.30]Neat, huh?
[07:39.70]I get it.
[07:40.82]That's funny.
[07:45.77]Yo, are you sneaking out to see her too?
[07:48.77]Awesome.
[07:49.45]She's the coolest, right?
[07:51.35]I want to be just like her when I grow up.
[07:53.39]Hey, don't tell me my parents... Don't tell my parents I'm here.
[07:56.37]Okay, I'm ready when you are.
[07:59.47]Where are we going?
[08:05.65]Well, here's Sans.
[08:08.31]I should probably save it.
[08:10.11]The sound of rushing water fills you with determination.
[08:12.47]Everything fills you with determination in this game.
[08:17.45]Wait, hold on.
[08:17.85]She just said something.
[08:18.63]Does this thing repeat it?
[08:20.29]Oh.
[08:25.63]I was saying it right.
[08:26.39]Okay.
[08:30.01]Haven't you seen a guy with two jobs before?
[08:32.88]Fortunately, two jobs means twice as many legally required breaks.
[08:37.30]I'm going to Grillby's.
[08:38.34]Wanna come?
[08:39.46]Yeah, I wanna go to Grillby's.
[08:41.54]Well, if you insist.
[08:43.14]I'll pry myself away from work.
[08:45.42]Are we actually just gonna go to Grillby's?
[08:48.50]Over here, I know a shortcut.
[08:52.34]What?
[08:54.70]Fast shortcut, huh?
[08:56.47]Hey, everyone.
[08:57.53]Oh, these are the two dogs.
[09:01.39]Hey, Sans.
[09:01.89]Hi, Sans.
[09:03.43]Greetings, Sans.
[09:04.45]Hiya, Sansy.
[09:07.01]Hey, Sans, weren't you just here for breakfast a few minutes ago?
[09:10.79]Nah, I haven't had breakfast in at least half an hour.
[09:13.97]You must be thinking of brunch.
[09:15.79]This is great.
[09:19.34]Here, get comfy.
[09:24.14]Whoops, watch where you sit down.
[09:25.26]Was it a whoopee cushion?
[09:27.10]Sometimes weirdos put whoopee cushions on the seats.
[09:30.57]Anyway, let's order.
[09:31.71]What do you want?
[09:33.59]Oh, boy.
[09:36.09]Well, you can't just order French fries, right?
[09:41.41]You gotta get a burger.
[09:44.09]Hey, that sounds pretty good.
[09:46.01]Grillby, we'll have a double order of burg.
[09:49.98]Well, that's Grillby, the guy with the fire for a head.
[09:55.28]So what do you think of my brother, Ice Cold?
[09:58.40]Cold.
[09:59.56]Of course he's cold.
[10:00.84]He'd be cool too if you wore that outfit every day.
[10:06.72]He'd only take that thing off if he absolutely had to.
[10:09.92]Oh well, at least he washes it.
[10:11.46]And by that I mean he wears it in the shower.
[10:13.76]There's the burger.
[10:18.20]Here comes the grub.
[10:19.94]Want some ketchup?
[10:21.78]What does this have to do- wasn't I supposed to be on a quest?
[10:24.00]How long does this break?
[10:24.94]No, I don't want any ketchup.
[10:26.88]More for me.
[10:31.08]He just drank the- did he just drink the bottle of ketchup?
[10:32.66]Are you serious?
[10:34.56]Gross.
[10:37.48]Anyway, cool or not, you have to agree, Papyrus tries real hard.
[10:40.74]Like how he keeps trying to be part of the royal guard.
[10:44.40]One day he went to the house of the head of the royal guard and begged her to let him be in it.
[10:49.22]Of course, she shut the door on him because it was midnight.
[10:53.18]But the next day, she woke up and saw him still waiting there.
[10:56.36]Seeing his dedication, she decided to give him warrior training.
[11:00.32]It's still a work in progress.
[11:05.03]Okay.
[11:06.23]Oh, yeah.
[11:06.85]I wanted to ask you something.
[11:07.95]Uh-oh.
[11:08.69]Music turned off.
[11:09.39]It's getting real serious.
[11:12.61]Have you ever heard of Talking Flower?
[11:16.19]Yeah, I've seen that Talking Flower.
[11:19.31]He was an asshole.
[11:20.05]He was in the very beginning of the game.
[11:21.13]Yes.
[11:22.89]So you know all about it.
[11:24.54]The Echo Flower.
[11:26.06]Oh, wait.
[11:26.38]What?
[11:28.39]They're all over the marsh, say something to them, and they'll repeat it over and over, yeah?
[11:33.73]What about it?
[11:34.91]Well, Papyrus told me something interesting the other day.
[11:38.02]Sometimes, when no one else is around, a flower appears and whispers things to him.
[11:42.84]What?
[11:43.02]That's, okay, that's weird.
[11:45.02]Flattery, advice, encouragement.
[11:48.26]Predictions.
[11:49.71]Weird, huh?
[11:51.01]Someone must be using an echo flower to play a trick on him.
[11:53.77]Keep an eye out.
[11:55.19]Thanks.
[11:57.68]So what, someone's trying to fuck with my buddy Papyrus?
[12:03.62]Well, that was a long break.
[12:04.62]I can't believe I let you pull me away from work for that long.
[12:07.85]He didn't even eat his burger.
[12:09.15]There's still two full burgers.
[12:11.25]Oh, by the way, I'm flat broke.
[12:13.29]Can you foot the bill?
[12:14.91]It's just 10,000 gold?
[12:18.53]I don't have that much money.
[12:19.63]No.
[12:21.03]Just kidding.
[12:21.59]Grilled me.
[12:22.77]Put it on my tab.
[12:27.95]By the way, I was going to say something, but I forgot.
[12:30.89]This game's fucked.
[12:38.21]I love it.
[12:39.37]Grillby, what else you got to say?
[12:42.25]Nothing, apparently.
[12:42.93]Grillby said that your food is probably cold by now.
[12:50.31]How do I eat?
[12:50.69]Can I just eat it?
[12:53.68]This piranha plant is really freaking me out.
[12:56.71]Sans is interesting.
[12:58.05]He's told me about all kinds of incredible foods.
[13:00.73]But despite his knowledge, he always orders the worst burger off the menu.
[13:06.08]He's like the drunk bunny rabbit.
[13:08.68]See, as you come back and sit with me, everything shall fly with you around.
[13:13.54]There's the dog bone guy.
[13:16.59]Huh?
[13:19.11]Since when did you and Sans become friends?
[13:21.41]I don't like him.
[13:22.51]He loves to appear without moving.
[13:26.11]Was that really just an entire 15-minute segment just to go to lunch with that guy?
[13:46.01]Uh, yeah, by the way, sorry, like, I'm not really paying that much attention to chat.
[13:50.99]Because obviously I'm trying to take in the story and the characters and stuff, so I apologize.
[13:55.06]I'm glancing over when I can.
[13:57.86]I do apologize also for the, oh, I apologize.
[14:00.52]I apologize, but I apologize.
[14:01.72]The fucking space heater behind me is so annoying.
[14:05.06]This is the way I was going, so this is the way we're gonna go.
[14:11.89]Wait, should I call?
[14:14.06]Should I call Papyrus and tell him?
[14:16.06]Like about the flower thing?
[14:18.82]No.
[14:23.31]No.
[14:23.73]Shouldn't I tell him that people are whispering at you?
[14:30.39]Alright.
[14:31.25]Save it again.
[14:31.75]What does he have to say now?
[14:35.94]Let's hang out again sometime?
[14:38.20]For a second I thought he was going to say if you want to go hang out somewhere else.
[14:42.58]All that gives my life validation is explaining the echo flower.
[14:45.88]No one can know.
[14:46.66]Never trust a flower.
[14:49.58]That's one of the constants of this world.
[14:52.12]Yeah, I know.
[14:52.96]In the very beginning, there was a flower that was really mean.
[14:55.12]Okay, we got falling rocks.
[15:08.36]Use the box.
[15:08.92]Oh, hold on.
[15:09.22]Let's see what this sign says.
[15:10.89]This is a box.
[15:12.34]You can put an item in or take an item out.
[15:14.48]Why would you, though?
[15:16.18]You can't use items when they're in the box.
[15:18.74]Sincerely, a box hater.
[15:22.14]Use the box?
[15:22.70]Yeah, why not?
[15:23.40]What do I have in here?
[15:24.91]I don't think I can do much with this stuff.
[15:33.83]Okay, this is interesting.
[15:35.69]Can I, like, walk down this?
[15:39.15]I kind of can.
[15:41.77]Let's just see what's down here first.
[15:46.39]Uh... An echo flower!
[15:48.97]What did somebody say?
[15:50.47]I swore I saw something behind that rushing water.
[15:59.00]Really?
[16:01.74]Which rushing water would that be?
[16:06.04]Like up here?
[16:12.64]Let's not get hit by the rocks.
[16:18.08]Interesting.
[16:19.18]Casting a very large shadow.
[16:22.96]This is kind of creepy.
[16:26.91]Oh, it's Papyrus!
[16:29.99]Hi, Undyne.
[16:31.01]I'm here with my daily report.
[16:33.69]Regarding that human I called you about earlier.
[16:37.15]Did I fight him?
[16:38.31]Yes, of course I did.
[16:39.87]I fought him valiantly.
[16:42.12]What?
[16:42.56]Did I capture them?
[16:44.32]Well, no.
[16:46.04]I tried very hard.
[16:47.12]Undyne, but in the end, I failed.
[16:50.34]What?
[16:51.26]You're going to take the human soul yourself?
[16:53.58]But Undyne, you don't have to destroy them.
[16:56.02]You see?
[16:56.92]You see?
[17:04.06]I understand.
[17:04.58]I'll help you in any way that I can.
[17:11.69]Oh, it's the Jerma voice.
[17:12.93]That's just what I have to do.
[17:16.26]Is this guy going to fucking kill me?
[17:20.40]Whoa, whoa, can I move?
[17:21.14]I don't want to get hit by the fucking lightning spear.
[17:33.52]That's weird.
[17:42.24]Oh, it's the little dinosaur girl.
[17:44.80]Or guy.
[17:45.36]Yo, did you see the way she was staring?
[17:48.44]It was she, okay.
[17:50.32]That was awesome.
[17:53.58]I'm so jealous.
[17:55.44]What'd you do to get her attention?
[17:56.87]Come on, let's go watch her beat up some bad guys.
[18:01.91]Ow.
[18:06.17]Feeling of dread hangs over you, but you stay determined.
[18:09.67]Save.
[18:13.44]When four bridge seeds align in the water, they will sprout.
[18:27.33]It looks like just please make a bridge here.
[18:37.97]Teaching me new mechanics because I'm going to have to do it.
[18:42.13]Oh, this whole way probably.
[18:45.33]Aaron flexes in.
[18:46.29]What have we got here?
[18:50.63]I'm going to flex as well.
[18:52.23]You flex.
[18:53.15]Aaron flexes twice as hard.
[18:54.93]Attack increases for you too.
[18:57.87]Flexing contest?
[18:58.85]Okay, flex more.
[19:00.88]Winky face.
[19:07.00]Aaron is ready for your next flex.
[19:10.50]Alright, let's do a flexing contest.
[19:13.12]You flex harder, Aaron flexes thrice as hard.
[19:15.88]Attack increases for you too.
[19:18.50]Nice, I won't lose though.
[19:23.83]I'm gonna stay up here.
[19:27.45]Aaron is ready for your next flex.
[19:28.83]Should I flex again?
[19:35.65]You flex, Aaron flexes very hard.
[19:38.21]He flexes himself out of the room.
[19:39.83]Yeah, get flexed.
[19:45.74]That was a flexing contest.
[19:47.10]I won.
[19:49.24]Can't read that sign.
[19:51.88]Ice mushroom.
[19:55.76]What does turning these off even do?
[19:58.19]Don't know.
[19:58.55]Can I not make a bridge here?
[20:05.45]Oh, what?
[20:06.29]Shit, I didn't want to do that.
[20:08.12]I did not want to pick it up.
[20:10.90]Can I not pick this shit up?
[20:11.94]I gotta reload the area, don't I?
[20:15.40]Maybe I can go from the other side?
[20:27.17]Like this?
[20:28.75]Yeah!
[20:42.66]Yes, I did kill Toriel.
[20:44.86]I didn't understand what was happening.
[20:49.40]It's not going to do anything, is it?
[20:53.24]Okay, I've got to go here.
[20:55.40]I thought it was going to... It has to be four connections.
[20:58.04]I know, I know.
[20:59.17]Let me leave and reset.
[21:02.75]It's got to be four in a row, you ding-dong.
[21:05.11]I just figured it out.
[21:06.45]I figured it out.
[21:14.97]Watch, this sign's gonna tell me this is all just a worthless pain in the ass that I didn't really need to do this for anything.
[21:25.46]Alright, so because, like, the stream's been going for, like, a little bit now, and there's, like, enough people here to explain myself, I didn't understand what was happening.
[21:34.82]Hold on, let me turn off my space heater so I can think.
[21:40.32]That space heater is so loud, it's hard for me to even comprehend words I'm saying out loud.
[21:46.39]What does the sign say?
[21:47.87]Congratulations.
[21:49.70]You failed the puzzle.
[21:53.58]I knew it was going to be something like that too.
[22:04.64]Also, to the mods, if somebody says a spoiler, just give them a small timeout.
[22:13.12]I don't want to ban people outright.
[22:15.16]Because some people might just be coming in and not know.
[22:17.81]Fuck.
[22:18.29]This is before.
[22:20.65]That's what I get for talking.
[22:25.25]Yes, for those of you that are just joining, this is my first time playing the game.
[22:29.41]So I don't want spoilers.
[22:31.65]One, two, three.
[22:35.48]That's not going to... One, two, three, four.
[22:37.44]No, hold on.
[22:37.84]I'm going to read the sign.
[22:40.96]If an error is made, the bell will blossom.
[22:42.38]Okay.
[22:42.76]I just rang the bell.
[22:45.16]Ding, ding.
[22:50.18]So this is one, two, three, right?
[22:52.42]It has to be four.
[22:57.01]Although, do they have to be in a line, or can they just be touching?
[23:02.03]We're about to find out.
[23:06.63]They have to be touching.
[23:16.71]Del, please!
[23:21.88]Where was this lot before?
[23:24.28]Up here?
[23:30.46]Saying Star Wars spoilers, yeah, don't say like Star Wars spoilers.
[23:36.15]Like there's just like no reason for that shit.
[23:42.87]Unless you're gonna say that like Chewbacca has gray hair.
[23:46.17]There you go.
[23:46.93]All right, let me think about this.
[23:55.26]You know, they go up like that.
[24:00.38]I want to see what happens when I do this.
[24:02.22]Curious.
[24:06.50]Yeah, that's it.
[24:15.73]Ring.
[24:17.79]Hello, Mrs. Papyrus.
[24:19.15]How did I get this number?
[24:20.43]Oh, it was easy.
[24:21.63]I just dialed every number sequentially until I got yours.
[24:26.02]So, what are you wearing?
[24:28.08]I'm asking for a friend.
[24:30.87]She thought she saw you wearing a bandana.
[24:33.17]Is that true?
[24:33.95]Are you wearing a bandana?
[24:37.35]What will you say?
[24:37.97]Uh-oh.
[24:45.80]I don't know.
[24:47.04]I'm supposed to be dating him right now, by the way.
[24:49.36]Me and Papyrus are together.
[25:01.54]No, I'm not wearing one.
[25:03.78]So you aren't wearing a bandana?
[25:06.70]Got it.
[25:07.92]You're my friend, so I trust you 100%.
[25:10.24]Have a nice day.
[25:12.16]Oh, fuck.
[25:14.96]I gotta take the bandana off.
[25:16.54]Oh, I gotta take off the bandana.
[25:18.44]Get it off.
[25:20.24]Drop it.
[25:20.64]How do I throw it away?
[25:21.56]I just lied to my boyfriend.
[25:27.58]What do I do?
[25:28.18]Uh-oh.
[25:31.72]I don't know what to do.
[25:32.48]Should I just use it?
[25:33.78]You've reapplied the bandage.
[25:35.07]Oh, that was a bandage!
[25:36.01]What the fuck am I doing?
[25:37.23]I thought that said bandana.
[25:52.71]Oh, that was a serious brain fart moment.
[25:55.75]I thought that said bandana.
[26:08.99]That was just genuine, genuine.
[26:11.27]I was like looking over at chat and I was reading, I was like doing the fucking voice and... Ugh, gotta pay attention.
[26:22.98]A long time ago, monsters would whisper their wishes to the stars of the sky.
[26:26.66]If you hoped with all your heart, your wish would come true.
[26:30.58]Now all we have are these sparkling stones on the ceiling.
[26:34.83]No, that's not supposed to be the sky.
[26:36.79]Anything else?
[26:38.09]No, that's it.
[26:43.62]Wishing room.
[26:44.32]Uh-oh.
[26:48.04]Woshua shuffles up.
[26:52.48]No, no, no.
[26:55.18]Check him.
[26:56.58]Seven attack, one defense.
[26:57.54]This humble germaphobe seeks to cleanse the whole world.
[27:02.97]Scrub-a-dub-dubs.
[27:05.82]It's a big bar of soap.
[27:09.70]That's awesome.
[27:11.46]Looking for some good, clean fun.
[27:13.46]Okay, um... Joke.
[27:16.22]You tell a joke about a kid who ate a pie with their bare hands.
[27:21.63]Wushu's power is neutralized.
[27:23.83]No, that joke's too dirty!
[27:28.63]Cleanse it!
[27:32.31]Wushu is rinsing off of pizza?
[27:37.65]Uh, joke again.
[27:39.53]Tell a joke about a kid who ate a pie with their bare hands.
[27:41.49]Alright, tell that one.
[27:44.31]Oh, that joke's too dirty!
[27:45.52]Maybe I gotta pick one of the other things.
[27:55.56]Wosh- Washua, not Woshua.
[27:59.64]Washua is best friends with a little bird?
[28:01.79]It's friends with a little bird.
[28:03.23]Okay, well.
[28:05.69]I'm gonna touch him.
[28:07.11]You reach out, Washua recoils from your touch.
[28:11.11]Yuck!
[28:16.10]I'm not necessarily doing a pacifist run, it's just, it's fun to see the options.
[28:20.12]Woshua.
[28:25.68]Now if that was an A, I know it's supposed to be Joshua Washua, but if that was an A, if it was Washua.
[28:34.88]Hmm.
[28:36.41]I'm just gonna fuckin' hit him.
[28:42.90]Wash your teeth and eyes?
[28:46.52]Ah shit, I got hit.
[28:48.68]That barely even hurt me.
[28:50.58]Washoa is revolted at its own wounds.
[28:56.65]You ask Washoa to clean you, it hops around excitedly.
[29:00.81]Green means clean!
[29:05.89]Oh, what's that?
[29:06.59]Clean.
[29:08.83]Washua's revolted its own ruins.
[29:10.81]So how do I... Should I try to touch him again?
[29:15.00]Give him a friendly pat?
[29:16.92]Fresh!
[29:24.47]Okay, alright, Washua.
[29:25.67]I'm about to just fucking end you.
[29:28.25]Telling you another joke.
[29:32.93]Two kids that played in a muddy flower garden?
[29:36.03]Washer's power is neutralized.
[29:37.27]No, that joke's too dirty!
[29:40.01]Alright, Washua.
[29:40.75]I've had about enough of you.
[29:48.27]Fine.
[29:54.56]Fine.
[29:55.10]I wanted to see his other jokes.
[30:03.29]Whoops, I wasn't reading that.
[30:04.91]Thousands of people wishing together can't be wrong.
[30:07.01]The king will prove that.
[30:12.39]Come on, sis.
[30:13.55]Make a wish.
[30:18.86]I wish my sister and I will see the real stars someday.
[30:24.48]Interesting.
[30:28.24]I have a theory.
[30:28.88]I have a theory.
[30:29.88]I have a theory that these are just people.
[30:34.30]They're buried underground, and those are like their heads and their brains, and this is like the... the last thing that they heard.
[30:39.94]No, I'm kidding.
[30:45.72]Ah, it seems my horoscope is the same as last week's.
[30:50.38]Look through the telescope?
[30:51.30]Of course.
[30:56.73]Check wall.
[30:59.23]Check wall?
[31:01.95]What wall?
[31:03.74]Anything else over here?
[31:06.78]Check wall.
[31:10.66]Okay.
[31:11.96]It's pointing up.
[31:16.45]Check wall.
[31:19.97]Is it going to be a Jerma emote?
[31:21.17]Yeah.
[31:21.71]There was supposed to be one yesterday.
[31:23.21]I don't know how long Twitch takes to pass through emotes.
[31:28.67]Like get them into the system.
[31:29.71]I don't know.
[31:35.53]Ancient writing covers the walls.
[31:36.83]You can just make out the words.
[31:39.35]The War of Humans and Monsters.
[31:40.73]I just want to make sure that was enough.
[31:47.08]Why did the humans attack?
[31:48.34]Indeed, it seemed that they had nothing to fear.
[31:51.04]Humans are unbelievably strong.
[31:52.90]It would take the soul of nearly every monster just to equal the power of a single human soul.
[32:00.70]Interesting.
[32:03.51]But humans have one weakness, ironically, which is the strength of their soul.
[32:07.18]Its power allows it to persist outside the human body even after death.
[32:13.36]If a monster defeats a human, they can take its soul.
[32:16.38]A monster with a human soul, a horrible beast with unfathomable power.
[32:22.98]It's an illustration of a strange creature.
[32:25.34]There's something very unsettling about this drawing.
[32:29.78]Okay, so if a monster takes a human soul, they become an absolutely devastatingly powerful, huge, huge, jacked, jacked guy, you know?
[32:40.98]Whoa.
[32:46.81]What if I want to go back?
[32:49.27]Oh, well.
[32:55.57]Ah!
[32:58.19]Is that... It's...
[33:00.39]Holy shit.
[33:01.59]What the fuck is happening right now?
[33:04.76]Oh my god.
[33:05.56]Alright, just run.
[33:09.44]If I've learned anything in video games, it's sometimes you just gotta run.
[33:12.46]And that time is right now.
[33:17.48]Easy.
[33:19.42]Look at all these spears.
[33:20.34]Fuck.
[33:22.85]Fuck!
[33:29.77]No!
[33:30.21]I was trying to go up.
[33:31.49]I'm gonna have to eat one of those cinnamon buns.
[33:39.61]God!
[33:43.48]Did I make it?
[33:46.12]I'm hidden.
[33:47.44]I think.
[33:47.76]I don't know if I can move.
[33:50.58]I think this is a cutscene.
[33:56.96]Huh?
[33:57.12]Huh?
[34:00.26]No my little dinosaur friend Thanks for the help Can I take I want to find her where is she I Wish you go weird.
[34:22.52]Where's the dinosaur?
[34:26.04]I Can't find her
[34:32.92]Oh.
[34:34.71]Hey.
[34:37.67]Yo, did you see that?
[34:39.71]Undyne just touched me.
[34:41.99]I'm never washing my face ever again.
[34:43.69]Man, are you unlucky.
[34:46.17]If you were standing just a little bit to the left.
[34:49.08]Yo, don't worry.
[34:49.94]I'm sure we'll see her again.
[34:55.22]I'm sure we will, too.
[34:57.64]I'm sure we will, too.
[35:01.91]Oh, cake!
[35:03.72]Oh, it's cheese.
[35:04.68]This cheese has been here so long a magical crystal has grown around it.
[35:07.66]It's stuck to the table.
[35:11.56]Who put the cheese there?
[35:17.91]Come get the cheese, Mouse.
[35:19.99]Squeak.
[35:20.97]Oh, shit!
[35:24.15]If I reload the area, can I look at this flower again?
[35:26.49]Oh.
[35:29.38]Hopefully that didn't say anything important.
[35:33.12]There's a piece of cake.
[35:34.34]Come on, let's be real.
[35:35.96]There's a red velvet cake with pink frosting.
[35:41.11]Knowing the mouse might one day extract the cheese from the mystical crystal fills you with determination.
[35:48.75]Sure does.
[35:57.20]Hey, look.
[35:58.62]It's my buddy Sans.
[36:01.84]I'm thinking about getting into the telescope business.
[36:04.08]It's normally 50,000 gold to use this premium telescope, but since I know you, you can use it for free.
[36:11.83]How's about it?
[36:13.77]Use the telescope?
[36:14.85]Yeah.
[36:19.53]I think there's something wrong with your telescope, Sans.
[36:25.62]Doesn't seem to work.
[36:32.12]Okay.
[36:33.78]Huh?
[36:35.22]You aren't satisfied?
[36:36.80]Don't worry.
[36:38.12]I'll give you a full refund.
[36:39.50]It's an odd looking telescope.
[36:43.18]What's wrong with it?
[36:43.88]I don't get it.
[36:50.61]What was it pointing at?
[36:51.33]I don't understand.
[37:00.58]Uh, use the box.
[37:06.28]Shit, hold on.
[37:07.40]Give me the tough glove.
[37:10.46]Whoa!
[37:12.12]What's wrong with my eye?
[37:15.17]What's wrong with my eye?
[37:19.59]What's going on with this eye?
[37:26.55]Huh?
[37:26.99]It looked like the cheese for a second.
[37:30.75]What's going on?
[37:31.69]What was that?
[37:32.17]Does he just have it covered up?
[37:38.60]Oh, I wanted to, uh... I, like, lied to Papyrus, so I need to, like... Let's, like, put the tough glove back on, right?
[37:46.06]This is the, uh... Tough glove weapon for a worn pink glove for five fingers.
[37:50.79]No.
[37:55.23]Armor.
[37:55.55]Manly bandana.
[37:57.31]Shit.
[37:57.77]Why did I lie to Papyrus?
[37:58.91]Can I call him and say I didn't mean to lie?
[38:02.74]What does more damage, that or the knife?
[38:05.74]I think the knife does.
[38:07.50]It's just a prank.
[38:09.81]Where's the gumdrop?
[38:11.89]What's a star?
[38:13.49]Can you touch it?
[38:14.91]Can you eat it?
[38:16.27]Can you kill it?
[38:18.89]Are you a star?
[38:22.37]I don't think so.
[38:24.91]Pac-Man!
[38:25.37]Pac-Man!
[38:26.47]Pac-Man's in the game!
[38:27.42]Look, Pac-Man!
[38:28.18]Oh, I love Undertale!
[38:29.26]It's got Pac-Man!
[38:32.90]Wait, I don't wanna leave yet.
[38:37.68]I'm gonna go up.
[38:45.02]I remember this guy, this is the hotdog vendor.
[38:48.38]I relocated my store, but there are still no customers, man.
[38:52.43]Fortunately, I've thought of a solution.
[38:54.69]Punch cards!
[38:55.91]Every time you buy an ice cream, you can take a punch card from the box!
[38:59.65]If you have three cards, you can trade them for a free nice cream and they're sure to get the customers to come back.
[39:06.93]Okay.
[39:10.11]Uh, there's a reason why he's here.
[39:11.25]25.
[39:11.27]You know, I'll buy one.
[39:17.08]Your cards in the box.
[39:18.08]You got a nice cream.
[39:19.28]Okay.
[39:19.68]Just so I can get, I want to get the punch card.
[39:24.56]Yeah.
[39:24.70]Give me the card.
[39:26.98]That's funny.
[39:27.56]That's awesome.
[39:29.06]The ancient glyphs have been painted over with a list of 21 different flavors.
[39:35.42]You dummy.
[39:36.00]It was an ancient temple.
[39:38.67]You can't do that.
[39:41.39]Look at this.
[39:41.73]He's got a creepy face, too.
[39:43.41]Almost like he knows what he... You know what you did.
[39:45.41]It's gonna go down.
[39:53.90]So what is the... Let me see.
[39:55.66]Punch card.
[39:59.35]Punch card.
[40:00.01]Battle item used to make punching attacks stronger in one battle.
[40:04.97]Use outside of battle to look at the card.
[40:06.65]Alright.
[40:12.09]So I can just look at the card?
[40:15.25]Please, please come back.
[40:19.99]What?
[40:23.43]What the hell is... Nice cream.
[40:25.65]It's the frozen treat that warms your heart.
[40:27.33]No.
[40:31.91]There's ice cream hidden in the depths of a watery cavern.
[40:34.59]I'm going to buy another one.
[40:39.51]I want to buy another one.
[40:40.29]Let's see what happens.
[40:41.26]Does he punch my card?
[40:44.80]Your card's in the box.
[40:45.70]You got the ice cream.
[40:46.64]So now I have two cards.
[40:50.34]Give me... Well, I can't take that one.
[41:06.78]How much health do I have?
[41:10.30]Punch card.
[41:12.03]You know, I used to have a punch card to, like, a bunch of places, and it was once you got ten, or nine, you got your tenth one free.
[41:24.65]That's pretty terrifying.
[41:28.77]Like, this, the punch card?
[41:32.15]That is so sad.
[41:34.26]Please, please come back.
[41:36.02]Well, I did come back.
[41:42.58]That's scary.
[41:43.42]Well, can I make some room here?
[41:44.99]How much health do I have?
[41:47.83]Full HP.
[41:49.85]I have items.
[41:52.21]I'm going to put the glove in the box.
[41:55.61]I don't have any reason to be carrying it, I don't think.
[41:58.65]So that means I can get my other punch card.
[42:01.96]Does the other punch card say anything else?
[42:07.57]Maybe it'll say something else.
[42:13.41]No, it just says that again.
[42:21.36]It's so sad, you killing Toriel.
[42:23.66]I didn't know.
[42:24.40]I thought this was like an RPG where you hit people with your sticks and shit.
[42:30.02]She told me she wanted to test my strength.
[42:31.76]Hold on, rubber ducky.
[42:32.62]Everyone calm down.
[42:33.42]Quiet.
[42:34.54]This is very important.
[42:41.69]And plus, that was a real creepy beginning.
[42:43.21]Like, she was, like, treating me like a child and stuff, and that was right... Look, I'm gonna break this down.
[42:48.21]Give me one second.
[42:49.89]The flower in the beginning of the game that told me, oh, everyone's so happy and nice, and the world is so wonderful.
[42:56.59]He lied to me, he laughed in my face, and tried to kill me.
[42:59.64]Then, the next character that I'm introduced to...
[43:03.47]I am introduced to a character that is extremely nice, wants to give me, like, warm tea and fucking cupcakes and give me, like, a bedroom and shit.
[43:11.25]I took her own advice.
[43:13.47]I didn't know.
[43:13.87]I thought she was going to try to kill me.
[43:18.53]I thought she was going to kill me.
[43:19.47]Like, the last time I trusted a character was the first character that I was introduced to.
[43:23.54]How do I deal with this rubber ducky?
[43:29.44]Hey, do you want a punch card?
[43:33.29]I could just go down, I guess.
[43:36.63]And it was very creepy, you know?
[43:37.95]She's in, like, her own little bedroom.
[43:40.45]She has, like, her office.
[43:41.47]She tells you not to go anywhere.
[43:43.27]Finally, she goes to, like, into the basement.
[43:45.61]She goes into the basement.
[43:48.75]This character goes into the basement, and this creepy music plays while you're following her.
[43:55.69]I thought that that was an evil character that was going to try to, like, keep me in a cage or something.
[44:03.25]You hear a passing conversation.
[44:05.96]So, don't you have any wishes to make?
[44:07.34]Sounds like a wishing well.
[44:18.86]You hear a passing conversation.
[44:20.89]Hmm, just one, but... That's kind of stupid.
[44:26.63]So this is some... A couple people walking around, talking.
[44:30.23]Oh, shit.
[44:31.60]You walk into Moldsmall.
[44:35.10]Moldsmall.
[44:39.10]Wait, I can already spray them?
[44:40.04]I'm gonna flirt with it.
[44:42.84]You wiggle your hips.
[44:44.10]Moldsmall wiggles back.
[44:45.18]What a meaningful conversation.
[44:48.23]That's funny.
[44:52.19]Wiggle your hips?
[44:53.13]I just pictured the character putting his hands on his sides with his fists and wiggling around.
[44:57.95]Doing a little suggestive look.
[45:01.85]What about you?
[45:02.29]What about flirt with B?
[45:06.61]Scores, burble, burble.
[45:11.34]You know, I... I'm sorry.
[45:13.72]I'm sorry, guys.
[45:14.54]I mean, like, this... Fuck these things.
[45:21.24]Sexy wiggle?
[45:26.01]So should I wiggle back?
[45:29.53]Ugh.
[45:32.11]I don't like these things.
[45:32.89]These things are weird.
[45:34.55]Fuck you.
[45:35.18]They're dead.
[45:38.36]Slime sounds.
[45:48.26]Sometimes you just gotta, you just gotta, you gotta end it.
[45:52.56]I'm sorry.
[45:53.31]A jello mold that has like a sexy wiggle.
[45:57.05]I don't know.
[45:57.37]That's a little odd.
[45:58.37]That's a little odd.
[46:00.27]They're going away.
[46:02.32]I need to get experience too, guys.
[46:04.04]I've been sparing too many people.
[46:08.46]What the fuck?
[46:10.92]Why did you do that?
[46:12.06]I don't know, why do anything?
[46:24.70]Somebody's gonna be in this bush.
[46:27.36]It's a pair of ballet shoes, will you take it?
[46:30.80]Yes, sure.
[46:33.21]Oh, damn it.
[46:34.03]Hold on.
[46:34.25]I gotta go put something away.
[46:39.33]I'm coming back for those shoes.
[46:43.25]What do I think of the game's music?
[46:44.41]I think the, uh, was it Bone Trussel?
[46:46.97]The papyrus music?
[46:49.48]Is the best song in the game.
[46:51.26]So far.
[46:55.04]Especially with the boss fight music.
[46:56.46]It is, it's just great.
[47:05.98]I'll keep one punch card.
[47:07.08]Give me those shoes.
[47:21.21]Can I go anywhere else over there?
[47:33.12]Washua and Aaron.
[47:34.18]I already talked to you two.
[47:35.10]I know how to deal with Aaron.
[47:37.54]Oh, shit.
[47:39.06]I hit the button accidentally.
[47:41.86]All of his attacks are harder to dodge at the bottom of the box.
[47:46.50]Sure.
[47:46.80]Aaron is splashing you playfully.
[47:56.53]Alright, Aaron.
[47:57.13]Flexing contest.
[47:57.93]Let's go.
[48:07.41]I like this music too, the battle music.
[48:19.29]Fuck.
[48:22.17]Aaron is ready for your next flex.
[48:24.43]Flex!
[48:27.03]Flex yourself out of the room.
[48:29.85]Wash your soul.
[48:36.68]Washable wonders of tears are sanitary.
[48:44.59]Hmm.
[48:48.37]Yeah, I ate a pie with bare hands.
[48:49.71]It's gross.
[48:51.49]Do not joke about that.
[48:52.77]It's disgusting.
[48:58.10]I'm going to touch you.
[49:01.76]I have to hit him, don't I?
[49:02.78]Yeah, I think I got to hit him.
[49:08.35]Yeah, I'm gonna hit you.
[49:09.17]Hope this doesn't kill him.
[49:10.93]Oh, fuck, it killed him.
[49:15.21]Whoops.
[49:17.17]I just one-shot him.
[49:21.21]Oh, I just one-shot him.
[49:22.27]I didn't want to do that.
[49:23.09]I just wanted to tap him.
[49:25.75]Whatever, my love increased.
[49:32.97]Let's go get the...
[49:36.51]I'm sorry, Mr. Washua.
[49:39.12]I didn't mean to do that.
[49:41.88]You didn't even try the third option.
[49:46.50]Give me those shoes!
[49:49.12]I will take the ballet shoes.
[49:51.60]You got the ballet shoes.
[49:52.56]Alright.
[49:53.84]What the hell are these?
[49:59.51]Ballet shoes.
[50:00.21]Weapon tech 7.
[50:01.49]These used shoes make you feel incredibly dangerous.
[50:09.18]Put them on.
[50:09.62]Are you serious?
[50:12.54]You equipped a ballet shoes.
[50:15.80]Attack 710.
[50:16.26]What is it with the toy knife?
[50:20.08]10-3.
[50:26.08]Okay, yeah.
[50:26.68]Definitely putting the shoes on.
[50:30.93]Keep those shoes on.
[50:33.55]I feel so dangerous right now.
[50:43.98]The only place I haven't gotten, not did, not lose it.
[50:48.32]Hello, this is Papyrus.
[50:49.66]Remember when I asked you about clothes?
[50:51.66]Well, the friend who wanted to know.
[50:54.29]Her opinion of you is very... murdery.
[50:57.41]Well, hurry not, dear human.
[50:59.23]Papyrus would never betray you.
[51:01.15]You said you were not wearing a bandana.
[51:04.07]So of course I actually told her.
[51:06.03]You were indeed wearing a bandana.
[51:07.92]It's paining me to tell such a bold-faced lie.
[51:09.88]But since you aren't wearing a bandana, she surely won't attack you.
[51:13.40]Now you are safe and self-fucked.
[51:33.02]What did I do?
[51:37.42]What did I do?
[51:40.74]Get this bandana off my head.
[51:47.21]Get this off.
[51:50.53]Whoa, whoa, that was a flower.
[51:51.35]That was a flower.
[51:51.85]That was a little, that was a flower.
[51:58.10]Just go.
[51:58.82]Just fucking, I don't care about you two jello molds.
[52:01.39]Jello sucks.
[52:03.09]He was right here.
[52:05.37]You saw the flower?
[52:06.03]He was just sitting right here.
[52:14.38]I gotta get this bandana off.
[52:19.14]He just told me.
[52:19.84]Ugh.
[52:28.59]I think I'm in trouble here.
[52:32.59]Can I spare you and just run?
[52:34.11]Ah, I can't.
[52:34.95]Well, Aaron, you know what to do.
[52:37.98]Flex.
[52:44.78]Flex again!
[52:51.12]Shit!
[52:51.80]Okay, I didn't stand still.
[52:52.60]I had to move.
[52:54.14]Flex again.
[52:54.88]Get the hell out of here.
[52:58.02]Now you, you, I don't want to kill you.
[53:00.44]Or do I?
[53:02.92]It was just one hit.
[53:06.82]It was one hit, guys.
[53:10.18]No, just go.
[53:20.48]You hear a passing conversation.
[53:23.14]Don't say that.
[53:24.32]Come on, I promise I won't laugh.
[53:27.27]So we're slowly hearing about a wish.
[53:31.72]Anything over here?
[53:32.38]No.
[53:34.00]God, it's cold in this room.
[53:39.36]The power to take their souls.
[53:41.37]This is the power that humans feared.
[53:46.87]Aaron.
[53:47.23]Aaron, do you want a punch card?
[53:57.93]Oh, what?
[54:06.20]What?
[54:07.14]Get out of here.
[54:14.00]Drama, kill them all.
[54:15.74]No, you can't kill them all.
[54:19.04]Oh, shit.
[54:19.38]This actually looks pretty passive to me.
[54:24.19]It's gonna be a cat, isn't it?
[54:25.65]Is it gonna be a cat?
[54:29.50]They're gonna put their heads up, there's gonna be two cats.
[54:34.18]I knew it.
[54:35.49]I knew it was a cat.
[54:38.35]No, it's an octopus.
[54:41.07]Hey there.
[54:42.15]Noticed you were here.
[54:43.05]I'm Onyxan.
[54:45.41]Onyxan, you hear?
[54:46.19]That's his face.
[54:49.22]What the fuck is this thing doing?
[54:55.32]You're visiting Waterfowl, huh?
[54:56.76]It's great here, huh?
[54:58.18]You love it, huh?
[55:00.04]Yeah, me too.
[55:01.18]It's my big favorite.
[55:03.15]Okay, this guy's scaring me.
[55:05.55]Even though the water's getting so shallow here, I have to sit down all the time, but hey, that's okay.
[55:12.81]It beats moving to the city and living in a crowded aquarium like all my friends did.
[55:21.91]And the aquarium's full.
[55:23.51]Anyway, so even if I wanted to, I... That's okay, though.
[55:26.91]Undyne's gonna fix everything, you hear?
[55:28.53]I'm a fucking creep.
[55:30.95]I'm gonna get out of here and live in the ocean, you hear?
[55:35.89]Leave you alone.
[55:37.27]Hey there, that's the end of this room.
[55:39.67]I'll see you around.
[55:40.41]Have a good time.
[55:42.10]In Waterfall.
[55:48.74]This cave is fucked.
[55:50.68]But I love it.
[55:58.95]Chiron hides in the corner, but someone encounters you anyway.
[56:03.77]Smile.
[56:04.64]Conduct.
[56:05.42]Hum.
[56:05.68]I'm just going to hum.
[56:07.12]You hum a sad song.
[56:08.36]Chiron follows your melody.
[56:17.65]Seems much more comfortable singing along.
[56:19.41]Alright, get out of here.
[56:24.41]Get out of here.
[56:29.21]The northern room hides a great treasure.
[56:30.79]Okay.
[56:34.59]Cool.
[56:36.23]This power has no counter.
[56:37.57]Indeed, a human cannot take a monster's soul.
[56:40.18]When a monster dies, its soul disappears.
[56:42.82]An incredible power would be needed to take the soul of a living monster.
[56:48.90]There's only one exception.
[56:50.86]The soul of a special species of monster called a boss monster.
[56:54.71]A boss monster's soul is strong enough to persist after death.
[56:58.29]if only for a few moments.
[56:59.29]A human could absorb this soul, but this has never happened.
[57:04.19]And now it never will.
[57:08.51]Hmm.
[57:13.26]Alright, I apologize.
[57:14.30]I gotta turn this on.
[57:16.34]I gotta turn my heater back on.
[57:17.86]It's too cold.
[57:18.96]It's too cold.
[57:21.68]It's too damn cold.
[57:23.78]It's too damn cold.
[57:26.11]Let's go get the treasure.
[57:28.28]Oh, a piano.
[57:29.54]Play the piano.
[57:32.30]Yeah.
[57:43.93]Huh?
[57:52.19]Well, that's something that I don't... I don't know.
[57:58.42]Haunting song echoes down the corridor.
[58:00.10]Won't you play along?
[58:01.28]Only the first eight are fine.
[58:12.28]It's not the thing that the lady was just singing to me, is it?
[58:16.54]Let's get a wild guess.
[58:24.42]Got it.
[58:29.17]Try one more time.
[58:30.07]One more time.
[58:30.49]I have a gift for stuff like this, guys.
[58:39.10]That's copyright.
[58:39.76]That's copyright.
[58:40.38]Don't take that from me.
[58:41.16]I'm gonna fucking make a song out of that.
[58:42.36]That's copyright.
[58:42.98]It was here first on Twitch TV at exactly, uh... 9 a.m.
[58:48.81]I don't even know what time it is.
[58:54.71]Um...
[58:58.50]Someone's going to be singing me a song at some point.
[59:05.48]Rain.
[59:11.03]Don't mind me.
[59:13.71]What are you?
[59:15.25]It's a statue.
[59:16.19]The structures at its feet seem dry.
[59:18.33]Can I give him a punch card?
[59:34.26]Oh, a sub?
[59:34.78]Did I miss a sub?
[59:38.32]Thanks for subbing.
[59:40.41]Shit, I missed you.
[59:45.29]I'm certain something will happen.
[59:49.73]Umbrellas, umbrellas, umbrellas.
[59:50.65]Give me an umbrella.
[59:54.55]I know what to do with this.
[59:55.18]I'm going to go stand over there.
[59:56.02]Please take one.
[59:56.66]Yeah, okay.
[59:57.36]I'm going to go over here.
[60:00.42]Put the umbrella on the statue.
[60:01.74]Yes.
[60:08.39]Hold on a second.
[60:10.01]Wait a second.
[60:10.77]I'm listening.
[60:19.88]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[60:22.32]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[60:24.20]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[60:35.65]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[60:40.19]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[60:42.95]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[60:48.51]Dun.
[60:54.09]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[61:06.03]Fuck!
[62:01.81]That was it, right?
[62:05.81]Fucking, come on.
[62:10.25]No, it's my fucking stupid controller.
[62:12.33]Quit fucking up.
[62:14.80]Oh my god, I'm gonna throw up.
[62:27.40]That wasn't it?
[62:42.14]Ah, fuck.
[63:42.99]That was close.
[63:43.93]That was close.
[64:03.78]I'll get it one day.
[64:04.68]I like, I like forgot.
[64:11.14]I gotta go listen to it again.
[64:13.25]I, like, lost it, like, halfway through that one.
[64:20.37]Okay, I'm putting on both headphones, hold on.
[64:34.23]I think, I think, where does it start?
[64:44.68]So it's like... Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[64:53.41]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[65:11.08]So it starts with this one, right?
[65:13.14]The high one?
[65:16.21]Dun dun dun dun.
[65:28.92]I feel like that first note didn't even matter.
[65:30.72]Yeah!
[65:46.20]That's what you get when you put in two headphones.
[65:48.09]You put in both your headphones and then you can solve the fucking puzzle.
[65:51.23]Hold on a second.
[65:57.35]I'm gonna eat something.
[66:03.70]Eat an ice cream.
[66:05.64]You're just great.
[66:06.38]You recovered 15 HP.
[66:11.02]It's going.
[66:12.62]A magic crystal ball.
[66:14.28]Do I read the sign or grab it?
[66:15.48]Read the sign.
[66:16.68]Can I read the sign?
[66:18.20]I can't read the sign.
[66:20.57]The ball is in the way.
[66:21.57]I have to touch the ball.
[66:22.89]It's a legendary artifact.
[66:25.35]Will you take it?
[66:32.29]Legendary artifact.
[66:33.07]I kind of have to take it, right?
[66:35.91]Maybe that'll be bad if I do take it.
[66:38.11]You're carrying too many dogs.
[66:44.02]What the hell are you talking about?
[66:46.40]It's a legendary airflow.
[66:47.02]Will you take it?
[66:47.56]Take it.
[66:48.04]You're carrying too many dogs?
[66:52.70]Knowing dog?
[66:53.68]I don't... What is this?
[66:56.08]A knowing dog.
[66:56.90]Dog.
[66:57.26]A little white dog.
[66:58.22]It's fast asleep.
[67:00.96]Why do I have a dog?
[67:06.60]You deployed the dog.
[67:07.76]You...
[67:20.51]What the fuck just happened?
[67:24.79]What just happened?
[67:28.65]Did I lose the artifact?
[67:29.93]Is that it?
[67:31.65]Is that what this was for?
[67:41.04]Well, that last 15 straight minutes to figure out the song turned out to be a waste of time.
[67:45.74]It was just a ball.
[67:48.15]That music was funny.
[67:58.16]Okay.
[67:59.22]Do I have, like, anything... Dog residue?
[68:01.98]Hold on.
[68:02.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[68:04.59]Go back in this room.
[68:06.27]Dog residue.
[68:07.77]What is dog residue?
[68:09.25]Did he shit on me?
[68:11.79]Dog item.
[68:12.31]Dog-shaped husk shed from a dog's... What do I do with this?
[68:22.19]I kind of don't want to use this.
[68:23.63]I probably could use this somewhere.
[68:24.73]Or should I just use it?
[68:27.49]What happens if I use it?
[68:28.29]I'm just going to use it.
[68:36.49]Just use it.
[68:37.50]You used the dog residue.
[68:39.82]You finished using it.
[68:41.40]An uneasy atmosphere fills the room.
[68:48.22]Did I just eat dog shit?
[68:51.43]How do I get rid of this?
[68:54.19]I'm going to keep it.
[68:55.01]You know, some weird character down the road is going to want to eat dog shit.
[68:59.15]And I'll give it to him.
[69:09.21]Let's just go.
[69:10.75]Wasn't there a duck?
[69:11.51]What happened to the duck?
[69:17.53]Should I take the umbrella back?
[69:23.58]Can I have an umbrella?
[69:24.34]Yeah, I want one too.
[69:27.26]Hey.
[69:30.96]Is that, what is this, mud?
[69:36.63]Water?
[69:38.15]Oil?
[69:39.97]Hey, you want an umbrella?
[69:40.67]Yo, you got an umbrella?
[69:43.18]Awesome.
[69:44.88]Let's go.
[69:45.36]All right, this person just doesn't know when to leave me alone, huh?
[69:50.45]You know, you can have... They're free!
[69:51.77]The umbrellas are free in the other room.
[69:53.97]I'm gonna show you.
[69:55.73]Come with me.
[69:57.53]I'm gonna show you the umbrellas in the other room.
[69:59.10]They're free.
[69:59.80]Take one.
[70:01.52]Yo, I already looked.
[70:02.92]Undyne's not over here.
[70:04.70]So I guess I'll see you later.
[70:06.70]No, you!
[70:07.42]Come on!
[70:08.00]I was trying to give you an umbrella.
[70:14.32]Oh.
[70:15.28]I guess we have to go.
[70:16.14]Let's go!
[70:16.50]I still have the bandana on.
[70:23.93]I don't know if I... I can't really take it off, can I?
[70:26.53]Can I just, like, throw the bandana on the ground?
[70:29.73]No.
[70:33.38]A manly bandana.
[70:36.90]Well... Whatever.
[70:42.90]Man, Undyne is so cool.
[70:44.88]She beats up bad guys and never loses.
[70:46.82]If I was a human, I would wet the bed every night, knowing she was gonna beat me up.
[70:54.48]You're really making this encouraging for me as a human, aren't you?
[71:04.13]Flower.
[71:06.99]So, one time, we had a school project where we had to take care of a flower.
[71:11.85]The king, we had to call him Mr. Dreamore.
[71:15.81]volunteered to donate his own flowers.
[71:17.73]He ended up coming to school and teaching the class about responsibility and stuff.
[71:21.61]That got me thinking.
[71:23.01]Yo, how cool would it be if Undyne came to school?
[71:26.83]She could beat up all the teachers.
[71:31.23]You're a weirdo.
[71:35.06]Um, maybe she wouldn't beat up the teachers.
[71:37.90]She's too cool to ever hurt an innocent person.
[71:41.76]I'm innocent.
[71:42.94]I'm innocent.
[71:49.38]What am I looking at here?
[71:53.60]Am I looking at something?
[71:57.01]Oh.
[71:59.01]This is cute.
[72:01.15]You ready to go to the Magic Kingdom?
[72:03.75]The Disney Castle?
[72:05.35]Where are you going?
[72:08.35]This little ADD character is driving me crazy.
[72:17.13]Return the umbrella.
[72:18.07]No.
[72:22.12]Yo, this ledge is way too steep.
[72:25.06]And I'm going to use you and jump on your head.
[72:27.40]Yo, you want to see Undyne, right?
[72:29.04]Put up your umbrella and climb up on my shoulders.
[72:30.82]But it's raining.
[72:31.66]Don't you see?
[72:33.66]Fine.
[72:35.20]Put it back.
[72:39.32]Thanks for the boost.
[72:41.80]Yo, you go on ahead.
[72:43.02]Don't worry about me.
[72:44.22]I always find a way to get through.
[72:45.46]And you break your nose every 15 minutes, by the way.
[72:51.32]Probably should see a doctor about that.
[72:54.07]Save point, save point, save point, save point, save point.
[72:57.21]The serene sound of a distant music box.
[72:59.21]It fills you with determination.
[73:02.07]Save.
[73:04.83]The humans, afraid of our power, declared war on us.
[73:07.83]They attacked suddenly and without mercy.
[73:11.44]Well, humans kind of sound like dicks, don't they?
[73:14.50]In the end, it could hardly be called a war.
[73:16.96]United, the humans were too powerful and us monsters too weak.
[73:20.19]Not a single soul was taken and countless monsters were turned to dust.
[73:25.71]It's kind of sad.
[73:29.51]Watch out for the- this is a big conveyor belt.
[73:36.47]I have plenty of ice cream.
[73:37.45]I'm about to probably fight somebody.
[73:43.17]Watch out for the three blobs.
[73:44.07]There's more than three.
[73:50.64]Okay.
[73:52.10]I'm gonna pull this shit again.
[73:54.72]Can I talk?
[73:57.52]Can we talk about this?
[74:00.98]Let's talk!
[74:04.20]I don't wanna- I just wanna be your friend!
[74:06.75]Didn't you talk to Papyrus about this?
[74:12.67]We need to be best friends!
[74:15.17]Anything down here?
[74:15.73]Nope.
[74:24.18]You're stressing me out with this music.
[74:30.94]Shit.
[74:31.44]Wrong way.
[74:37.27]Getting faster, it seems.
[74:39.63]Getting way faster.
[74:40.63]Where do I go?
[74:45.21]Did I miss it or something?
[74:46.37]What the fuck is going on?
[74:53.76]Oh my god!
[74:57.17]Shit!
[75:01.17]It's going too fast!
[75:04.81]Oh shit!
[75:05.69]Oh my goodness!
[75:08.17]Oh no!
[75:18.02]It is going so fast at this point.
[75:25.44]Oh my fucking god!
[75:32.69]This is just carnage.
[75:35.71]Pure carnage.
[75:39.65]Shit.
[75:41.38]Get me out of this room, please.
[75:43.14]Please let this be the exit.
[75:45.72]Thank god.
[75:47.32]What the fuck?
[75:49.40]It's not done.
[75:52.60]This is not done.
[75:58.37]Uh.
[76:00.25]Music stopped.
[76:00.99]Music stopped.
[76:06.81]How much health do I have?
[76:08.03]I can't even go in my inventory.
[76:10.59]She's gonna be right here, isn't she?
[76:17.37]Oh.
[76:21.11]What do you want from me?
[76:24.11]Undyne.
[76:28.38]no no sounds like it came from over here oh you've fallen down haven't you are you okay here get up jer
[76:54.15]I forgot to put, like, the rest of my name.
[76:55.77]I started to write Jerma, and I just, like, forgot, I just didn't, I hit J-E-R, and then I, like, went to go get a drink, and I came back and hit enter.
[77:05.70]Something like that happened.
[77:06.88]That's a nice name.
[77:08.70]My name is... Who was it?
[77:20.55]Oh, dirty water, gross.
[77:28.64]Am I like... Jake's Junkyard or something?
[77:32.30]Like, what is this?
[77:33.80]Piles of garbage.
[77:34.62]There are quite a few brands you recognize.
[77:38.61]Just garbage.
[77:47.61]Piles of garbage.
[77:48.55]There are quite a few brands you recognize.
[77:53.52]Just garbage.
[77:56.58]The waterfall here seems to flow from the ceiling of the cavern.
[78:00.45]Occasionally a piece of trash will flow through and fall into the bottomless abyss below.
[78:06.27]Viewing this endless cycle of worthless garbage, it fills you with, you guessed it, determination.
[78:11.70]Hmm.
[78:23.50]Wowzer garbage.
[78:24.26]Yeah, that's a garbage tricycle.
[78:26.78]You rest your hand on the rusted bike.
[78:28.60]Its horn wheezes a honk of despair.
[78:32.50]That wasn't really despair.
[78:33.48]That was pretty comical.
[78:35.96]Let's see.
[78:36.30]Listen.
[78:38.31]That's not despair.
[78:39.81]Come on.
[78:41.07]Garbage.
[78:42.55]Mailbox.
[78:43.89]Beat up desktop computer.
[78:45.23]The inside is empty.
[78:49.80]Garbage.
[78:51.34]Can of Spam.
[78:52.24]It's a cooler.
[78:52.88]It has no brand and shows no signs of wear.
[78:55.18]Inside are a couple of freeze-dried space food bars.
[78:59.78]Uh, can I take one?
[79:04.50]Can I get rid of... Can I get rid of the dog residue?
[79:09.71]I'm gonna get rid of the dog residue.
[79:11.27]But if I have... I don't.
[79:13.89]I don't know.
[79:14.39]I feel like this is the reason why I need to have this.
[79:16.81]I have a lot of healing.
[79:17.73]I'm up with a knife.
[79:19.33]Just drop the fucking knife.
[79:20.51]Who cares?
[79:22.31]Get rid of the knife.
[79:23.01]I don't give a shit.
[79:25.31]I want space food.
[79:27.36]I want some astronaut food.
[79:31.20]Trash heap.
[79:32.80]It's a DVD case for an anime.
[79:35.20]Desperate claw marks cover the edges.
[79:39.14]And Snoopy.
[79:40.38]Seems like a regular training dummy.
[79:41.94]Do you want to beat it up?
[79:44.94]No.
[79:46.04]You stare into each other's eyes for a moment.
[79:50.32]Had enough of the dummies.
[79:51.64]I didn't want to hurt him.
[79:53.92]He's like a little Snoopy dog.
[79:55.02]I gotta keep him around.
[79:58.99]Snoopy the dog's gonna come over and help me, isn't he?
[80:02.81]What?
[80:06.89]Too intimidated to fight me, huh?
[80:08.99]I'm a ghost that lives inside a dummy.
[80:11.31]My cousin used to live inside a dummy, too, until you destroyed their home as ghosts spend our whole lives looking for proper vessel.
[80:19.84]Slowly, slowly we grow closer to our new bodies, until one day we two become more corporeal beings, beings able to laugh, love, and dance like any other.
[80:30.94]But you, my cousin's future, you took it all away.
[80:35.06]Despicable.
[80:36.06]Despicable, despicable!
[80:37.86]Human, I hope you're not too attached to your body, because your soul's about to get infected.
[80:45.96]Mad dummy blocks the way.
[80:52.24]Let's talk about this.
[80:53.46]Oh, shit, he's ugly.
[80:55.41]You talk to the dummy.
[80:57.51]It doesn't seem much for conversation.
[81:00.17]No one is happy with this.
[81:02.15]Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful!
[81:10.78]Whoa.
[81:11.98]Ow.
[81:12.50]You dummies.
[81:14.03]Watch where you're aiming your magic attacks.
[81:17.01]Hey, you.
[81:18.37]Forget I said anything about magic.
[81:20.85]Mad dummies looking nervous.
[81:33.16]Talk to the dummy.
[81:34.54]Doesn't seem much of a conversation.
[81:35.68]No one is happy with this.
[81:37.52]Get hit by your own shit.
[81:42.49]Whoops.
[81:47.22]That dummy's doing an armless ska dance.
[81:56.50]What if I hit him?
[81:58.12]That dummy's doing an armless ska dance.
[81:59.62]I don't need a heal.
[82:04.11]What about with the food?
[82:06.33]Didn't I pick up this?
[82:07.09]I picked up that, like, fucking food down here, right?
[82:11.19]Maybe if I give him the astronaut food.
[82:14.73]Give him the dog shit?
[82:22.14]Will that do anything?
[82:23.16]I don't know.
[82:27.76]Hold on.
[82:28.24]Maybe in a minute.
[82:30.46]I don't want to, like... I don't know what that's going to do.
[82:33.98]I want to hit him with his own stuff again.
[82:38.13]He's shooting his salt shakers at me.
[82:45.84]Mad dummy glares into a mirror, then turns to you with the same expression.
[82:58.00]Mad dummy says, because they're a ghost, physical attacks will fail.
[83:01.50]I will stand in the window of a fancy store.
[83:10.96]Well, I'm just fucking killing them.
[83:14.53]Smells like a clothing store.
[83:15.95]Alright, I will try it.
[83:26.22]I'll do it.
[83:28.52]I'm gonna give him the dog shit and we'll see what happens.
[83:31.64]Use the dog residue.
[83:33.78]You've finished using it.
[83:35.22]An uneasy atmosphere fills the room.
[83:38.53]Then everything I want will be mine!
[83:44.59]Didn't do anything.
[83:47.36]He's getting cotton all over the dialogue box.
[83:50.88]How do I?
[83:51.24]Talk, talk, talk.
[83:52.00]Do you talk to the dummy?
[83:53.68]Doesn't seem much of a conversation.
[83:55.02]He doesn't want to talk.
[83:57.32]He doesn't want to talk to me.
[84:02.95]Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[84:05.17]What cousin is he talking about?
[84:06.39]Whoa, fuck!
[84:12.34]Did I kill him?
[84:16.27]Like, I can't spare him.
[84:18.69]These attacks don't work.
[84:27.75]Dog residue, again.
[84:30.86]He finished using it.
[84:32.10]An uneasy atmosphere fills the room.
[84:34.52]What was their name again?
[84:35.54]Alright, this guy has time to die.
[84:41.78]I don't even care.
[84:44.84]You're just, you're going.
[84:47.34]Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[84:53.82]Shoot him.
[84:56.36]Mad dummy's getting caught all over the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[85:00.77]They're a damn ghost.
[85:09.37]Shit.
[85:09.94]I keep aiming in the wrong direction.
[85:11.24]I gotta be over here for that.
[85:18.74]Here we go.
[85:19.26]I'll get him here.
[85:24.80]Anything else to say?
[85:25.54]I can't... Can I... What happens if I just try to spare him?
[85:33.46]Well, let's see what happens.
[85:35.26]Feeble, feeble, feeble!
[85:38.20]Well... Time for you to fucking get destroyed then, buddy.
[85:53.24]Hey, guys!
[85:55.08]Whoa!
[85:56.26]Dummies, dummies, dummies!
[85:58.54]Remember how I said not to shoot at me?
[86:01.36]Well, failures, you're fired.
[86:03.89]You're all being replaced.
[86:09.45]Now you see my true power, relying on people that aren't garbage.
[86:14.42]Mechanical words fill the room.
[86:18.56]Can we talk about it now?
[86:20.98]Doesn't seem much for conversation.
[86:24.90]No one's happy with this.
[86:26.60]Dummy bot's magic missile!
[86:31.46]Oh, whoa!
[86:34.52]Mad W's doing an armless god dance.
[86:36.14]Alright, you know what?
[86:36.58]I'm going to take a Cinnabon.
[86:37.94]We're okay.
[86:38.82]Maxed out full.
[86:40.38]Didn't need to do that.
[86:46.46]Oh, they do one revolution.
[86:48.68]Good to know.
[86:50.36]They do one revolution.
[86:54.31]That means I could go like this and... I just got fucking owned.
[87:05.45]Final attack.
[87:06.19]Shit.
[87:14.55]Holy shit.
[87:17.53]Got him.
[87:20.67]No way.
[87:22.54]These guys are even worse than the other guys.
[87:25.30]Who cares?
[87:25.92]Who cares?
[87:26.52]Who cares?
[87:27.74]I don't need friends.
[87:29.63]He's got a knife?
[87:30.79]I've got knives.
[87:36.55]I'm out of knives.
[87:39.81]But it doesn't matter.
[87:40.83]You can't hurt me and I can't hurt you.
[87:42.97]You'll be stuck fighting me forever.
[87:45.51]Forever, forever.
[87:47.11]This guy's nuts.
[87:51.72]What's going on?
[87:54.34]What's happening?
[87:57.95]Acid rain?
[87:59.67]Oh, forget it.
[88:00.33]I'm out of here.
[88:04.21]What was that?
[88:08.28]Sorry I interrupted you, didn't I?
[88:11.02]Oh, this is the guy from the beginning.
[88:12.74]This is the guy from the beginning.
[88:16.92]This guy, I could have stepped on him, but I didn't step on him.
[88:21.14]As soon as I came over, your friend immediately left.
[88:23.74]Oh no.
[88:24.84]You guys looked like you were having fun.
[88:27.36]Oh no.
[88:28.46]I just wanted to say hi.
[88:30.66]Oh no.
[88:35.19]Well, I'm going to head home now.
[88:38.03]Oh, um... Feel free to come with if you want.
[88:42.15]But no pressure.
[88:43.75]I understand if you're busy.
[88:45.75]It's fine.
[88:47.17]No worries.
[88:48.83]Just thought I'd offer.
[88:54.14]That guy's cool.
[89:01.59]Let's go.
[89:01.95]I'm gonna go to his house.
[89:07.01]Hey.
[89:08.12]My house is up here.
[89:09.62]In case you want to see.
[89:11.56]Or in case... you don't.
[89:18.28]You feel a calming tranquility.
[89:19.52]You're filled with determination.
[89:25.79]Alright, I can turn the heater off now.
[89:28.21]For now.
[89:31.57]Uh, let's check out some, let's check out the area.
[89:47.67]There's a sign.
[89:49.39]North Bluke Acres, East Hotland, and then I don't know where the hell Temmie Village is.
[89:57.78]Let's go to his house.
[90:00.42]Which one of these fucking houses is his?
[90:02.69]The two thumb houses.
[90:04.91]It's locked.
[90:05.35]Hey, it's me.
[90:12.79]Oh, you really came.
[90:14.68]Sorry, I wasn't expecting that.
[90:17.28]It's not much, but make yourself at home.
[90:21.28]Going to your fridge to eat your cheese.
[90:23.54]Oh, are you hungry?
[90:25.48]I can get you something to eat.

[90:57.98]Start the sub train!
[91:00.75]We like to party.
[91:02.61]We like, we like to party.
[91:05.69]Hey.
[91:10.35]It's a family tradition.
[91:12.39]Do you want to join me?
[91:14.93]Yeah.
[91:16.49]Okay, follow my lead.
[91:19.87]You just lie on the ground?
[91:22.46]Here we go.
[91:23.20]You'll lie down as long as you don't move.
[91:27.12]So, only move around when you want to get up.
[91:29.10]I guess.
[91:37.35]I'm going to use the bathroom and just sit here.
[91:39.73]I'm going to lie on the ground.
[91:40.35]I'll be back in like a minute or two.
[91:41.81]Hold on.
[91:42.11]No, no, no.
[91:42.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[91:43.21]What's going on?
[91:50.05]Are we reaching enlightenment right now?
[91:59.85]Uh-huh.
[92:01.55]I guess we're contemplating the stars and the moon and the sun and shit.
[92:11.49]Okay.
[92:12.15]Well, I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
[92:15.43]Hey, let me know if something happens.
[92:17.87]Because this is gonna be on this screen for like at least two minutes.
[92:21.39]I'll be right back.
[92:31.41]I'm gonna turn my heater on, too, so I can heat the room up a little bit.
[92:35.96]You know, who gives a shit I'm not even in the room anyways, right?
[92:38.14]You know what I mean?
[92:40.23]Like, who gives a shit?
[92:42.17]I don't.
[94:23.10]God, it's cold.
[94:29.51]Why is it so cold down here?
[94:38.31]You know when it's so cold?
[94:39.82]You know when you're really cold?
[94:44.08]And...
[94:46.38]You do the thing where your body is almost like every one of your appendages, your arms, your legs, your fingers.
[94:52.16]They're made out of sticks.
[94:54.44]And you hold your arms and your legs down.
[94:57.18]You hold your hands and, like, fists down on your thighs.
[95:01.79]And you're walking around like you're the fucking Tin Man.
[95:04.79]And you need oil.
[95:06.23]I just did that all around my whole house.
[95:07.67]Just like, yeah, just walking around like there's sticks all over me.
[95:12.61]Ugh.
[95:15.12]Wait, what did I miss?
[95:16.20]I missed a cutscene?
[95:19.00]Did I really?
[95:19.48]No, I didn't.
[95:21.58]What did I miss?
[95:27.00]I missed a cutscene?
[95:28.02]No, you guys are pulling my leg.
[95:35.53]It was nine degrees this morning where I am.
[95:42.81]God, I just want to fill up a hot water bottle and just hold it on my stomach.
[95:49.58]Let's get up.
[95:51.78]I like the ghost.
[95:53.82]Well, that was nice.
[95:54.96]Thank you.
[95:58.38]Fuck you!
[95:58.90]I'm gonna break your fucking computer.
[96:05.78]The computer's internet browser is open to a music sharing forum.
[96:10.86]Okay.
[96:12.03]You're into music.
[96:12.61]That's cool, dude.
[96:15.90]He's working on a mixtape.
[96:16.80]He's got three books.

[96:24.12]Play it.
[96:24.48]Yeah.
[96:34.40]What is this one?
[96:35.72]This CD is labeled Spookwave.

[97:16.53]Give me those.
[97:17.83]Oh, this one.
[97:18.35]Once you learn the lyrics, it's hard not to sing along.
[97:20.57]This is fucking stupid.
[97:29.07]Can I turn your microwave on?
[97:30.31]Oh, that's my TV.
[97:32.05]There's a show I like to watch on it sometimes.
[97:44.20]What about the spiderweb?
[97:46.72]There's a flyer for a bake sale on it.
[97:54.60]It's ghost music, don't be so mean.
[97:57.25]What was this one again?
[97:57.99]I don't like this one.
[98:01.07]This one gives me a headache.
[98:04.15]I like this generic trumpet one.
[98:05.57]This one's good.
[98:18.21]So do I do anything else I can do here?
[98:19.41]Okay.
[98:26.25]Bye.
[98:27.49]Classic spook tune.
[98:28.50]They don't make songs like these anymore.
[98:30.12]Oh, it was nice to meet you.
[98:32.72]It was nice to hang out with you.
[98:34.40]You go back to doing what you were doing.
[98:39.74]Dumbass.
[98:42.84]Who's in the other... No, I don't want to listen to this the whole time.
[98:48.77]Do I have to listen to this song the whole time?
[98:50.31]Thank God.
[98:51.35]Oh, this is the music I like!
[98:53.63]Yeah!
[98:59.07]This song's the best.
[99:01.15]Wait, what do you want?
[99:04.07]Awkward.
[99:04.77]I'm working right now.
[99:06.31]I mean, welcome to Blook Family Snail Farm.
[99:09.05]You're the only employee.
[99:15.45]That snail is the coolest character in the game so far.
[99:19.31]This place used to get a lot of business, but our main customer disappeared one day.
[99:22.59]Now it's just some hairy guy that shows up once a month.
[99:25.77]This snail with the moustache is the fucking best character in the whole game.
[99:30.46]Snail, snail, a long journey extends in front of you.
[99:33.26]Snail, snail, reach far and stretch beyond the horizons.
[99:36.48]Snail, snail, so snarled Sam Buell.
[99:40.36]Best fucking character in the whole game.
[99:42.40]Good gosh, I don't look like a perfectly normal snail.
[99:47.64]Gosh, don't I just look like a perfectly normal snail, you fucking bastard?
[99:51.94]Who's this guy?
[99:53.72]Been long overdue for a second house.
[99:56.90]What are you doing on a snail farm?
[100:00.73]And how dare you be next to the best character in the whole game without something to say?
[100:07.93]Who the hell is this guy?
[100:09.63]What is this little tiny one?
[100:10.89]This snail is counting dollar bills.
[100:17.22]It's a snail.
[100:18.80]For some reason, you can't help but wonder what it tastes like.
[100:22.91]That's gross.
[100:23.71]Anything else to say?
[100:25.87]Good gosh, don't I look like a perfectly normal snail?
[100:28.11]No, you don't.
[100:29.07]You don't.
[100:30.45]Really, I'm working.
[100:31.61]I don't want the boss to get mad at me.
[100:32.95]Who's the boss?
[100:33.95]Especially since I'm my own boss.
[100:38.17]Well, fine.
[100:39.26]How do I buy?
[100:39.76]I want to buy all your snails.
[100:43.02]Oh, it's a racetrack.
[100:46.20]Yeah.
[100:48.07]How much does it cost?
[100:48.81]Do you want to play a game?
[100:50.53]It's called Thunder Snail.
[100:52.37]The snails will race, and if the yellow snail wins, you win.
[100:57.63]It's 10G to play.
[100:58.67]Play.
[101:00.07]Okay.
[101:00.73]Press Z repeatedly to encourage your snail.
[101:02.67]What's Z?
[101:04.37]What is Z on this?
[101:07.69]Dude, you ready for this one, guys?
[101:09.29]Okay, I can do Z on the keyboard.
[101:12.07]I'm using a controller, by the way, if you're curious.
[101:14.62]I'm going to fucking crush this.
[101:17.76]You ready for this?
[101:19.74]Ready?
[101:27.73]Why am I not moving?
[101:38.12]Why am I not moving?
[101:38.66]What's going on?
[101:39.16]I was looking down at Z. What?
[101:43.98]Am I pressing something wrong?
[101:48.54]Race end.
[101:52.00]Looks like you encouraged your snail too much.
[101:54.52]All that pressure to succeed really got to her.
[102:03.90]What?
[102:05.72]Yeah, I want to play again.
[102:06.76]This time I'm not going to... No encouragement.
[102:10.02]No encouragement.
[102:17.04]Go!
[102:17.84]Come on!
[102:19.04]No, no, I mean, don't go.
[102:20.12]I don't want to encourage you.
[102:22.06]What if I say... She's not going to win.
[102:26.12]A little bit of encouragement.
[102:30.57]Just, like, come on, you can do it.
[102:37.53]What?
[102:40.15]Alright, go!
[103:03.47]This guy's taking a lot of my money.
[103:10.82]Alright, go.
[103:13.60]I did one encouragement in the very beginning.
[103:26.84]Like, is there any indication of when I need to do it?
[103:37.72]I can't believe I'm sitting here watching fucking snails.
[103:55.68]Oh, her breast wasn't good enough.
[103:57.30]Oh, come on.
[104:00.72]All right, we're doing a bunch of fucking spam in the beginning.
[104:04.07]Like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[104:05.53]Because that's what we're typically, typical race, right?
[104:07.87]Let's say I, let's say I was doing a race.
[104:10.93]I was running in like a marathon race or something like that, right?
[104:14.41]I'm at the starting.
[104:16.01]Somebody's gonna, if I got like family and friends and I'm gonna like glance over and make eye contact with my mother, you know what I mean?
[104:21.90]And she's gonna be like, three, two, one, the race starts, go!
[104:26.20]And everyone's gonna scream.
[104:27.22]So that's what happens.
[104:27.88]Here we go.
[104:28.48]We're gonna treat it like a normal race.
[104:29.70]Like, yeah, you can do it!
[104:30.84]All right, good.
[104:35.76]That didn't work at all.
[104:39.48]She's really slow now.
[104:42.77]Alright, fucking whatever.
[104:44.09]You know what?
[104:44.39]Can I just, like, walk away?
[105:01.60]I'll tell you right now, if that's me, I don't stand at the finish line.
[105:05.00]I mean, the starting...
[105:15.97]I'm running out of money.
[105:17.01]I'm running out of money.
[105:19.29]Do I have any money?
[105:22.50]Last try.
[105:45.58]Come on, you can do it!
[105:49.28]Come on!
[105:55.25]Come on!
[105:59.15]Do it!
[106:02.51]Do it!
[106:08.40]Oh, you both tried your best.
[106:10.52]But the snail looks discouraged.
[106:12.26]The best wasn't good enough.
[106:14.00]Oh, thanks for the fucking 50 grand I just lost.
[106:17.86]Bye.
[106:18.18]You know what?
[106:22.73]Can I just eat the snail?
[106:23.87]Eat him.
[106:29.43]Let's go.
[106:29.87]I just wasted too much money.
[106:35.91]I don't even give a... I don't even give a shit.
[106:39.85]You feel calm.
[106:41.00]Yeah, well, not anymore.
[106:42.56]My snail didn't win the big race.
[106:47.78]I can go... I can go left or right.
[106:50.48]I'm gonna go left.
[106:56.00]Okay, this is a moment I've been waiting for.
[107:03.36]This little bird wants to carry you across.
[107:06.16]Accept the bird's offer.
[107:10.62]No.
[107:13.30]No, I don't... Because then he's... Is he going to bring me back?
[107:16.73]Will he bring me back?
[107:25.21]Sure.
[107:25.77]Let's just see what happens.
[107:45.29]That was so epic for what it was.
[107:48.11]That was a really good job.
[107:50.56]All right, you are now, you are the best character in the game.
[107:54.02]The snail mustache guy is the second best character, but you get to be the best character.
[108:08.19]Are you a star?
[108:10.17]Sans, what are you doing, buddy?
[108:14.98]I already did this.
[108:15.70]You already fooled me.
[108:17.24]No.
[108:24.94]Alright, let's go back.
[108:25.56]Let's do it again.
[108:28.04]Let's go.
[108:28.54]Yeah.
[108:47.44]This is so funny because it's playing on the trope.
[108:53.00]Like in games when characters can do that for you, it takes like a quarter of a second.
[108:58.01]But in reality, for him to really do that would take an immense amount of strength and concentration for him to do that.
[109:04.41]So, A plus gag.
[109:07.14]I like it.
[109:09.36]Let's go.
[109:17.66]Could go, right?
[109:18.18]Let's see what's over here.
[109:18.84]A lot of ways to go.
[109:30.99]The name of that song was Duck Carries You Over a Disproportionately Small Gap.
[109:38.33]That's funny.
[109:42.39]Oh, I can't do anything here.
[109:43.77]Can I?
[109:44.79]No.
[109:54.13]I didn't go up, did I, over here?
[109:55.99]No, I went that way.
[109:57.27]No, what about over here?
[109:59.51]That's his house.
[110:01.55]There's one more slot.
[110:04.65]Oh, oh!
[110:07.23]That's the dummy that tried to kill me, right?
[110:11.15]Is this his house?
[110:13.95]Doesn't seem like anyone's home.
[110:20.29]What, what, what?
[110:22.02]It's a living...
[110:25.31]What, what, what?
[110:26.77]It's a living.
[110:31.69]Can I like scream into his house horn?
[110:34.53]How do I scream into his house horn?
[110:36.33]Come on.
[110:37.50]That'll wake him up.
[110:43.60]Um.
[110:46.52]Okay.
[110:51.86]Whatever.
[110:57.82]I'll go back down.
[111:02.20]Nothing down here.
[111:03.08]Okay, that's the trash.
[111:12.31]Let's go up.
[111:15.71]Whoa!
[111:18.23]Got some neat junk for sale.
[111:21.63]Talk.
[111:21.93]I want to know about Undyne.
[111:26.29]Undyne, yeah, she's a local hero around here.
[111:29.59]For grit and determination alone, she fought her way to the top of the royal guard.
[111:34.27]Actually, she just came through here asking about someone who looked just like you.
[111:37.73]I'd watch your back, kid, and buy some items.
[111:41.73]It might just save your hide.
[111:42.89]Okay.
[111:46.87]Can I sell things?
[111:49.49]I'm trying to get rid of my junk, not get more of it.
[111:53.29]Oh, I've heard if you want to sell stuff, Jemmy really is your best bet.
[111:57.05]Nobody wants to buy things from you in this game.
[111:59.47]Where is it?
[112:01.19]I don't remember.
[112:01.97]What has he got?
[112:05.31]Crabapple CT.
[112:08.40]Cloudy glasses.
[112:12.88]Invincible Lunger.
[112:16.54]Torn notebook.
[112:18.26]Invincible Lunger.
[112:19.02]What does that mean?
[112:22.32]What the hell does that mean?
[112:25.35]Invincible longer.
[112:26.51]Minus two defense.
[112:27.43]But what does invincible mean?
[112:28.91]I'm losing a bunch of attack.
[112:35.35]Crab F-C-T.
[112:38.76]You know what, old man?
[112:39.52]I don't want any of your useless junk.
[112:48.65]Oh, there's more invincibility frames.
[112:51.25]I get you.
[112:55.52]I don't want any of your dumb crap.
[112:59.06]Be careful out there, kid.
[113:01.56]It's a tough work.
[113:03.71]What do I have in my box?
[113:06.67]Dog salad?
[113:12.07]Dog salad.
[113:14.11]Heals a certain amount of HP.
[113:17.33]Hit poodles.
[113:20.78]Where's all this dog item shit coming from?
[113:28.21]Just go this way, I don't know, whatever.
[113:34.05]Hurt, beaten, and fearful for our lives, we surrendered to the humans.
[113:37.68]Seven of their greatest magicians sealed us underground with a magic spell.
[113:45.17]Anything can enter through the seal, but only beings with a powerful soul can leave.
[113:50.97]They might be talking about me.
[113:56.69]Hold on, flowers.
[113:58.13]There's only one way to reverse this spell.
[114:00.35]If a huge power equivalent to seven human souls attacks the barrier, it will be destroyed.
[114:08.64]Okay.
[114:13.52]But this cursed place has no entrances or exits.
[114:16.54]There's no way a human could come here.
[114:19.48]We will remain trapped down here forever.
[114:26.04]I'm a human, right?
[114:34.15]Oh, I'm touching the star, whatever it is.
[114:39.29]Special enemy Temmie appears here to defeat you!
[114:44.11]Looks pretty nervous.
[114:50.60]Feed Temmie.
[114:52.30]Temmie only wants the Temmie flakes.
[114:54.92]No, he's so hungry he dies.
[115:01.44]Serious?
[115:01.82]I thought it said she died.
[115:04.81]Temmie's trying to glomp you.
[115:07.11]I'm gonna flex!
[115:12.19]Flex at Temmie.
[115:13.19]No, muscles are not cute.
[115:16.47]Oh, I have to disagree!
[115:17.73]Uh, yeah.
[115:21.82]Just the two of us, huh?
[115:27.30]What the fuck was that?
[115:28.38]Aaron is ready for your next flex.
[115:32.16]Well, just get out of here.
[115:33.16]Well, shoo.
[115:39.54]Fine.
[115:39.87]I just won somehow.
[115:49.21]I didn't even mean what if I killed that character.
[115:51.99]I didn't want to kill that person.
[115:57.79]Light the way.
[115:59.03]The mushroom lights.
[116:00.85]The mushroom lights!
[116:01.53]Where do we go?
[116:16.86]These dumbasses again.
[116:17.86]Get out of here.
[116:19.64]What?
[116:22.36]Sits in motionless?
[116:24.18]What just happened?
[116:27.96]Get out of my way.
[116:33.84]See, this is why I knew I didn't like these guys.
[116:36.52]Because now he's mold big.
[116:43.72]No, I'm just going to lie down.
[116:49.18]He understands life now.
[116:50.97]Roar.
[116:57.05]Your attack is really, really easy to dodge.
[117:02.60]Unhug.
[117:03.64]You don't hug Moldvig.
[117:05.50]It appreciates your respect of its boundaries.
[117:10.96]Oh, fuck.
[117:16.24]Okay, seems comfortable with your presence.
[117:18.32]Go away.
[117:19.34]Oh, we got spoilers?
[117:31.29]Uh-oh.
[117:35.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[117:41.43]There are people that might not have played the game.
[117:43.41]All I can ask you is please respect that
[117:47.60]Because there are plenty of people that probably haven't played.
[117:49.60]Me included.
[117:50.26]Either way.
[117:58.01]Huh.
[118:04.38]Does it have to do with the order I did this in?
[118:06.22]I don't know.
[118:14.08]I guess not.
[118:23.96]See, that one lit up now.
[118:24.96]Oh, I see.
[118:25.56]Okay.
[118:28.30]I got it.
[118:29.04]I got it.
[118:29.50]Don't worry.
[118:30.25]Fuck.
[118:32.31]These two.
[118:32.81]Hey, you know what I can do?
[118:34.59]I can run.
[118:35.49]Oh, shit.
[118:36.31]I can't.
[118:37.79]Your soul is unclean.
[118:38.79]Education.
[118:39.45]Fuck.
[118:45.98]Oh, I don't want to flex against this guy again.
[118:48.06]Oh, I will.
[119:09.99]Yeah, I don't want to know secrets.
[119:13.09]I'd rather find them out.
[119:14.55]If I want something, if I like really am stuck and I'm just like, you know what?
[119:18.27]Just somebody tell me.
[119:20.10]I'll say it.
[119:22.21]But for the most part, this is a blind, completely... For the most part, it is a blind, completely blind playthrough of the game.
[119:29.98]So, I don't know anything about it.
[119:33.48]All I know is what I've seen so far, and that is it.
[119:44.66]Oh, fuck!
[119:45.86]I wanted to spare him, not run.
[119:47.29]Whatever.
[119:57.41]Squeak.
[120:05.54]Oh, something to read.
[120:07.30]Without candles or magic to guide them home, the monsters used crystals to navigate.
[120:12.62]Those look like crystals.
[120:14.82]Don't they?
[120:19.57]Oh.
[120:20.81]I probably should have paid a little bit more attention to where the road was going.
[120:30.80]Didn't really get a good look at that one.
[120:35.16]Okay, here we go.
[120:36.00]Just fight this way.
[120:42.29]I know how to deal with you.
[120:43.25]This is the easiest way to deal with this.
[120:47.69]You smash Washua in the skull.
[120:49.73]What happened?
[120:57.28]It's my different weapon?
[121:12.50]I don't know.
[121:19.61]I want to look at that.
[121:20.13]I'm going to kill this guy because I want to see what that was.
[121:23.95]What was that for?
[121:26.16]Which one is it?
[121:26.80]Okay, that was... I'm really, really just confused by that.
[121:29.98]Am I, like, on drugs or something?
[121:32.58]I don't know.
[121:46.77]Not doing pacifist run.
[121:47.97]Do you have to get all of them?
[121:51.53]I think maybe you just have to hit all of them.
[121:53.69]Okay, I get it.
[122:02.93]Get out of here.
[122:08.07]It's the triple smack.
[122:14.11]Keep it lit.
[122:15.07]Light.
[122:17.03]Got a light.
[122:21.22]Here we go.
[122:30.44]I did it.
[122:33.87]57,000 followers but no info section.
[122:39.69]Yeah, whatever.
[122:40.91]I just stream.
[122:43.65]If the stream turns on, you'll see.
[122:45.60]Hi.
[122:45.86]Uh-oh.
[122:50.76]It's getting kind of dark.
[123:00.50]A flower.
[123:02.70]Behind you.
[123:04.32]Ah!
[123:09.66]So who said that to the flower for that to be the last thing that it heard?
[123:15.19]Seven.
[123:16.47]Seven human souls.
[123:17.91]With the power of seven human souls, our king, King Asgore Dreamor,
[123:24.64]will become a god.
[123:26.28]With that power, Asgore can finally shatter the barrier.
[123:29.70]He will finally take the surface back from humanity, and give them back the suffering and pain that we have endured.
[123:37.14]Understand, human?
[123:39.00]This is your only chance at redemption.
[123:41.40]Give up your soul, or I'll tear it apart from your body.
[123:49.07]Can I move?
[123:53.50]What?
[123:54.50]Undyne, I'll help you fight!
[123:58.22]No, don't help.
[123:59.48]You're my friend.
[124:01.16]Yo!
[124:02.54]You did it!
[124:03.80]Undyne is right in front of you!
[124:06.24]You've got front row seats to her fight!
[124:09.91]Oh, it's you.
[124:11.45]Wait.
[124:12.63]Who's she fighting?
[124:15.65]Hey!
[124:16.85]You aren't going to tell my parents about this, are you?
[124:19.81]No!
[124:25.50]You aren't going to tell my parents about this, are you?
[124:27.70]They've been building this fight up for a long time.
[124:32.32]Is it ever going to happen?
[124:36.78]Did I miss something?
[124:38.94]What's behind here?
[124:49.84]I can go this way.
[124:53.17]Lots of flowers here.
[124:55.85]You hear a passing conversation.
[124:57.37]Hmm.
[124:58.15]If I say my wish, you promise you won't laugh at me.
[125:03.67]Of course I won't laugh.
[125:08.71]Someday, I'd like to climb this mountain we're all buried under.
[125:12.65]Standing under the sky, looking at the world all around.
[125:15.53]That's my wish.
[125:19.43]You hear laughter.
[125:20.31]Hey, you said you wouldn't laugh at it.
[125:26.08]Sorry.
[125:26.86]It's just funny.
[125:28.44]That's my wish too.
[125:30.40]Oh.
[125:31.21]Aww.
[125:32.55]Wow.
[125:35.13]However, there is a prophecy.
[125:36.91]The angel, the one who has seen the surface, they will return and the underground will go empty.
[125:43.49]That's me.
[125:43.89]They're talking about me.
[125:44.60]That's me.
[125:46.38]I landed.
[125:47.20]I must be the angel.
[125:50.10]Wait.
[125:53.74]I can't go up there.
[125:54.36]Okay.
[126:01.82]Can't walk on the little beam.
[126:05.06]Can't go that way.
[126:09.31]Yo, you again.
[126:11.03]What do you want?
[126:11.53]You're really starting to get on my nerves.
[126:20.93]Yo, I know I'm not supposed to be here, but I want to ask you something.
[126:27.10]Man, I've never had to ask anyone this before.
[126:29.08]Um, yo, you're human, right?
[126:33.86]Man, I knew it.
[126:35.58]Well, I know it now.
[126:37.11]I mean, I always knew.
[126:39.39]Undyne told me, um, stay away from that human.
[126:43.05]So, like, um, I guess that makes us enemies or something.
[126:46.81]But I kind of stink at that.
[126:49.29]Yo, say something mean so I can hate you.
[126:53.25]Please?
[126:53.61]Uh...
[127:05.44]No.
[127:06.92]Yo, what?
[127:07.86]So I have to do it?
[127:09.04]Here goes nothing.
[127:10.74]Yo, I hate your guts.
[127:13.86]Man, I'm such a turd.
[127:17.05]You are a turd.
[127:18.37]I'm gonna go home now.
[127:22.79]So go.
[127:25.43]Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
[127:26.41]Whoa, my God, she just fell down.
[127:28.21]Whatever it is.
[127:30.95]I did not do that.
[127:32.97]Do not tell me.
[127:33.85]I didn't do it.
[127:34.73]Yeah, I know you're going to be looking for that.
[127:35.77]That's probably like your kid.
[127:38.91]What are you standing around for?
[127:40.25]Get over here, dude.
[127:45.00]Help.
[127:45.66]How do I help?
[127:48.60]See, I helped.
[127:52.20]Yo, dude.
[127:55.00]If you want to hurt my friend, you're going to have to get through me first.
[127:59.60]That's a bad thing to say to a scary boss person in armor.
[128:06.38]Or I feel like that person's in armor and they're going to take their helmet off and be, I'm a good guy or something.
[128:12.13]She's gone.
[128:14.29]Yo, you really saved my skin.
[128:15.53]I guess being enemies was just a nice thought.
[128:19.11]We'll just have to be friends instead.
[128:21.51]Man, I should really go home.
[128:23.53]I bet my parents are worried sick about me.
[128:25.05]Probably.
[128:29.44]Later, dude.
[128:33.08]Well... I wanted to prove to the person that's been chasing me the whole time that I'm a good guy.
[128:43.27]Would a good guy throw spears at you?
[128:45.87]No, but I wanted to show them that I'm a good person.
[128:51.97]If it worked or not, I don't know.
[128:59.01]That's big.
[128:59.35]What are you doing up there?
[129:01.05]How'd you even get up there?
[129:03.41]Seven human souls, and King Asgore will become a god.
[129:08.23]Six?
[129:09.55]That's how many we have collected thus far.
[129:12.07]Understand?
[129:13.25]Through your seventh and final soul, this world will be transformed.
[129:16.55]First, however, as is customary for those who make it this far, I shall tell you the tragic tale of our people.
[129:23.03]Of course!
[129:24.05]Of course you will!
[129:25.99]Tell me all about it!
[129:28.91]It all started long ago.
[129:29.99]I'm gonna stand on a peak of a mountain.
[129:32.25]And let's... Before I kill you, first, like every other... I'm gonna tell you the entire story of the game.
[129:37.35]Here we go.
[129:41.84]No.
[129:42.50]You know what?
[129:43.98]Screw it!
[129:49.70]Yes!
[129:50.88]Yes, that was the good... That was perfect.
[129:52.56]You got me.
[129:54.13]You did get me.
[129:58.72]You!
[129:59.69]You're standing in the way of everybody's hopes and dreams!
[130:03.09]Alfie's history books made me think humans were compassionate, but you... You're just a remorseless criminal!
[130:08.74]I just saved the person's life in front of you!
[130:11.62]You wander through the caverns attacking anyone of your pet?
[130:13.62]That's not true.
[130:14.86]Self-defense, please.
[130:16.74]You didn't kill them because you had to.
[130:18.68]You killed them because it was easy for you.
[130:21.08]Because it was fun for you.
[130:22.60]Do you think it was fun when I found out?
[130:24.90]Do you think it's fun when people's family members never come home?
[130:28.40]Is that fun?
[130:29.64]No.
[130:30.64]But your time's up, villain.
[130:32.98]you won't hurt anyone else a knight in shining armor has appeared and all the pain you infected on the fallen every hope every dream you've turned to dust she's gonna send right back through her spear I'll show you how determined monsters truly are come on step forward and let's end this let's go no save point oh no no no no wait no back it up
[130:58.11]No, that's not it.
[130:58.59]No more running away.
[130:59.73]No, that's not it.
[131:00.19]Here I come.
[131:00.67]Fuck.
[131:01.35]I can't lose.
[131:02.89]What do I do?
[131:05.97]Hold on, I gotta... I gotta put on... I gotta do something here.
[131:10.93]Hold on just a second.
[131:12.15]Give me a second.
[131:16.27]Uh-oh.
[131:20.65]I can't... I can't lose.
[131:21.59]Oh, God!
[131:26.16]Undyne attacks.
[131:28.17]Wait a minute, wait, hold on, just wait.
[131:30.17]Just... You need to, uh, plead.
[131:33.42]You told Undyne you didn't want to fight, but nothing happened.
[131:37.90]As long as you're green, you can't escape.
[131:40.54]Unless you learn to face danger head-on.
[131:43.12]You won't last a second against me.
[131:46.88]Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?
[131:48.63]What was that like math equation?
[131:50.17]What was the protractor doing there?
[131:53.41]Undyne towers threateningly.
[132:03.56]You tell Undyne her attacks are too easy, she doesn't care.
[132:06.87]When I said face towards danger, I mean face towards the bullets.
[132:11.75]What's my face?
[132:15.07]I don't understand.
[132:17.11]What is the blue?
[132:18.46]What is that?
[132:18.84]It's supposed to be my arm?
[132:25.58]Look, I gave you a spear to block the bullets with.
[132:29.14]Do I have to explain this any more clearly?
[132:32.30]So this is the spear.
[132:35.61]I thought I did that before.
[132:36.53]Okay, alright.
[132:39.45]Alright, bring it on.
[132:42.87]Yeah, your attacks are too easy.
[132:45.15]Not bad, then how about this?
[132:46.47]Yeah, oh.
[132:53.62]Nice.
[132:54.00]Let's do it again.
[132:58.78]You told them you didn't want to fight, but nothing happened.
[133:01.25]For years we dreamed of happy ending.
[133:10.69]Undyne's suplex is a huge boulder just because she can.
[133:18.46]Plead!
[133:18.78]I don't want to fight you!
[133:22.04]Sunlight is just within our reach.
[133:24.72]And a dog is doing like a dog shake behind me.
[133:26.97]Did you hear that?
[133:31.69]Draws her finger across her neck, the I'm going to kill you thing.
[133:37.69]Heroin that never gives up.
[133:43.46]Fuck.
[133:47.50]Suplexes huge boulder just because she can.
[133:49.26]I should probably heal.
[133:50.64]I'm gonna eat some ice cream.
[133:53.91]Are those claws natural?
[133:56.89]Enough warming up.
[133:57.89]Okay, this is where it's gonna get real.
[134:05.08]That wasn't pretty real.
[134:06.10]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[134:07.00]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[134:08.57]Easy.
[134:10.05]Oh, you son of a... I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[134:15.83]You know what?
[134:17.03]Just to make things interesting, I'm gonna... Yeah, take this!
[134:21.78]Hey, you're tough.
[134:23.50]Yeah, I am.
[134:25.82]I'm the human that... You're the worst nightmare human.
[134:31.02]Flips her spear impatiently.
[134:35.40]Even if you could beat me.
[134:37.51]You won't.
[134:38.73]Right?
[134:38.91]That's what you wanted to say, isn't it?
[134:39.95]That's what you wanted to say, isn't it?
[134:43.14]Okay, I can't move now.
[134:48.60]No human has ever made it past Asgore.
[134:50.76]Well, this one will.
[134:56.29]And then draws her finger across her neck.
[135:01.53]You tell Undyne her attacks are too easy.
[135:03.09]The bullets get faster.
[135:05.54]Honestly, killing you now is an act of mercy.
[135:07.42]Undyne flips her skin patiently.
[135:14.18]Yeah, he's here.
[135:16.23]Your attacks are too easy.
[135:17.95]I probably shouldn't be doing that.
[135:23.73]Hey, your shit's too easy.
[135:30.66]Stop being so damn resilient.
[135:34.62]He's gonna kill me.
[135:37.42]Okay, I gotta heal.
[135:38.08]I gotta heal.
[135:39.98]Holds her fist in front of her and shakes her head.
[135:41.76]Where's the ice cream?
[135:43.18]Need an ice cream.
[135:48.27]What the hell are humans made out of?
[135:49.85]Look at this tiny little box.
[135:56.25]That's not fair.
[136:01.73]Yeah, you fucking shit's too easy.
[136:11.78]Bring it on.
[136:13.52]Bring it on.
[136:15.46]Your shit sucks.
[136:17.98]She doesn't care.
[136:18.66]Oh, what?
[136:24.76]Holds her finger in front of her and shakes her head.
[136:27.11]I told you, your stuff sucks.
[136:34.35]That's not fair.
[136:38.79]So do I need to plead with her at certain points?
[136:41.50]Because I feel like this was working before.
[136:48.72]Okay, the bullets now get unfair.
[136:50.26]But I'm determined to.
[136:55.01]Damn it, I almost blocked them all.
[137:01.05]The bullets get unfair.
[137:03.86]End it right now, huh?
[137:10.43]Just eat me into the fucking Cinnabon.
[137:12.39]No, eat the Astro food.
[137:14.59]You eat the Astronaut food, you recover 21 HP.
[137:16.84]Yes, I did.
[137:33.09]right now she's getting really impatient she's getting extremely impatient she's laughing she's at a point where she's like really not happy about this at all I'm trying to figure out how to not kill her
[138:04.79]I'll just, like, cleave with her now.
[138:08.38]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[138:09.70]She remembers someone.
[138:10.68]Her attacks become a little less extreme.
[138:13.60]Die already, you little brat.
[138:14.86]A little less extreme!
[138:21.06]A little less extreme?
[138:22.40]A little less extreme?
[138:23.38]That was impossibly difficult.
[138:25.12]What?
[138:25.32]A little less extreme.
[138:27.14]Cinnabon.
[138:29.24]Alright, I think I taught... You're getting... Okay, we're gonna plead.
[138:33.46]See, I got her really, really angry.
[138:35.43]I gotta hold on.
[138:36.01]Calm down.
[138:36.51]Calm down.
[138:36.87]This is gonna be... I got this.
[138:37.87]I got this.
[138:40.79]Smashing spears in the ground.
[138:42.39]Plead.
[138:43.91]You just want to be friends.
[138:44.97]She remembers someone.
[138:46.25]Her attacks become a little less extreme.
[138:53.64]She's remembering somebody.
[138:59.80]And Ai's eyes dart around to see if this is a prank?
[139:03.68]Plead.
[139:04.94]You just want to be friends!
[139:09.27]She's... Alright, Ai is twitching involuntarily.
[139:13.47]Plead!
[139:13.77]I just want to be friends!
[139:27.66]No, I just want to be your friend.
[139:28.86]This is not less extreme, by the way.
[139:30.44]Hyperventilating.
[139:40.05]I feel like I got her out of spot.
[139:43.17]Or I could spare this and win this.
[139:53.41]Again, less extreme.
[139:58.58]Maybe I should challenge her now.
[140:01.16]Okay, Undyne's dart around to see if this is a prank.
[140:05.04]I'm gonna fucking challenge her.
[140:05.98]Shit, I feel like I'm so close.
[140:16.74]Undyne's eyes dart around to see if this is a prank.
[140:20.68]Fucking prank.
[140:22.22]Hold on a second, should I prank her?
[140:23.36]Do I have anything to prank her with?
[140:29.27]A heroine that never gives up.
[140:35.88]Maybe I should throw a punch at her.
[141:01.10]Smells like angry fish.
[141:09.74]She doesn't care.
[141:11.78]She obviously does!
[141:13.64]She obviously does!
[141:16.66]Oh no.
[141:29.13]She remembers someone.
[141:32.07]What the fuck is she remembering?
[141:33.27]Punch card!
[142:08.62]I spare you.
[142:11.04]I spare you.
[142:18.84]She's extremely angry.
[142:25.45]Hmm.
[142:26.45]The only things I can do, a Plead, Challenge, or Check.
[142:38.73]Or I can be like... Can I just fucking run away from this person?
[142:43.45]I'm running.
[142:43.81]Are you serious?
[142:46.83]What?
[142:47.13]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[142:47.91]I just got away.
[142:49.23]Stop running away?
[142:50.05]What?
[142:52.25]What?
[142:56.22]What just happened?
[143:00.38]I'm fucking... I'm doing it again.
[143:04.56]Get away from me.
[143:09.14]What did you... Can I... I don't know what to do.
[143:12.35]Did I just do it?
[143:12.95]Hold on, I have it saved.
[143:17.61]Where do I run to?
[143:18.77]I knew you would come back here.
[143:20.31]Here I come.
[143:22.05]Where do I run to?
[143:24.71]You little punk.
[143:26.75]Get away.
[143:27.35]Run.
[143:31.55]Oh god.
[143:32.43]She's chasing me.
[143:36.59]Welcome.
[143:37.77]No!
[143:38.57]No!
[143:41.21]Come back in.
[143:41.79]No!
[143:43.99]Run!
[143:47.03]Who's calling me?
[143:48.62]Hey, what's up?
[143:50.02]I was just thinking.
[143:51.12]You, me, and Undyne should all hang out sometime.
[143:54.22]I think you would make great pals.
[143:56.06]Let's meet up at her house later.
[143:58.24]Click.
[144:01.61]Shit.
[144:03.47]What a bad time for a phone call, Papyrus.
[144:07.79]You ain't gonna kill me.
[144:09.32]I'm gonna get away.
[144:10.88]Bye.
[144:12.40]Hey, hey, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.
[144:22.24]I can't wake him up.
[144:23.80]There has to be a way to wake him up.
[144:25.20]What are you doing?
[144:30.80]What?
[144:31.22]Go to the water cooler.
[144:35.91]I can't move.
[144:38.46]Armor's so hot.
[144:40.52]But I can't give up.
[144:43.50]Go get a drink of water.
[144:44.32]You'll feel better.
[144:46.74]Oh, shit.
[144:50.20]She looks dry.
[144:51.68]Water.
[144:52.12]Water, water, water, water, water, water, water.
[144:53.84]It's a water cooler.
[144:54.46]Take a cup of water.
[144:55.30]Yes.
[145:00.13]Give Undyne the water?
[145:12.52]You all thought I was gonna be a good guy in this playthrough.
[145:47.13]Everyone's just freaking out.
[145:50.32]Show mercy.
[145:51.66]Kill her.
[145:56.14]Give her the water.
[145:58.00]You don't have the guts.
[146:03.52]She did try to kill me.
[146:04.78]She did.
[146:05.88]Let's talk about this.
[146:08.14]I'm the one with all the power right now.
[146:13.00]I have a glass of water.
[146:13.86]I can give it to her.
[146:16.47]She tried to kill me.
[146:18.27]She might have had her reasons.
[146:20.47]But she did still, she was throwing spears at me the whole time.
[146:23.65]I even saved somebody's life in front of her.
[146:27.43]I pulled up a monster.
[146:28.87]I'm supposed to be this bad human.
[146:30.68]Pulled up the monster that was going to fall down into the ravine.
[146:35.30]And what?
[146:37.06]Like she didn't, you didn't see my compassion right there?
[146:40.70]On the other hand, on the other hand,
[146:44.69]I mean, she probably is fighting for some reason.
[146:46.47]She probably has some history.
[146:48.45]And she probably, this is the determination that she has that she wants to get to the surface.
[146:52.59]The humans just killed everybody and wiped out everything.
[146:56.08]She has her reasons.
[147:02.60]But then again, she did try to kill me.
[147:10.30]You know what?
[147:10.64]I'm going to regret this.
[147:11.47]Take the water.
[147:16.54]You're lucky I, you're lucky I spared you.
[147:27.86]Yeah, you're lucky.
[147:34.05]That's it?
[147:34.43]Are you serious?
[147:34.89]That's it?
[147:35.53]That's it?
[147:35.81]You're not gonna... Are you kidding me?
[147:39.37]Wow.
[147:41.79]Alright, if there's another, like, part two where I can, like, dump the water on her or not...
[147:47.30]I want a glass of water.
[147:50.49]I'm just gonna take it with me.
[147:51.33]Can I drink it?
[147:51.77]No.
[147:55.57]I brought you another water.
[147:56.65]Do you want some more?
[147:57.61]Cup of water returned to the water cooler?
[147:59.21]Why?
[148:01.27]Who the fuck is that?
[148:01.97]What is this clam person now?
[148:03.35]Who the fuck are you?
[148:08.53]What are you?
[148:09.71]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[148:10.85]I was thirsty, so I came over from waterfall to get a drink.
[148:16.01]Get a drink.
[148:18.62]Yeah, are you stupid?
[148:19.50]Here.
[148:19.72]Are you just carrying that around to look sophisticated?
[148:23.46]Because it's not working.
[148:32.71]Um, okay.
[148:37.23]Well, I want to see where she went.
[148:40.31]Where did he go?
[148:40.91]He was asleep at his post.
[148:45.48]Welcome to... I didn't even get a chance to look at this.
[148:47.14]Welcome to Hotland.
[148:58.94]So she's just gone.
[149:00.56]No, you know what?
[149:03.13]Papyrus, what the fuck is going on here?
[149:06.33]There's no response.
[149:14.98]Let's save it.
[149:22.78]Well, we push on.
[149:32.11]I kind of want to see what's over there.
[149:34.69]Oh, is that snow?
[149:35.59]Yeah, I don't understand either.
[149:48.46]We're gonna have like a pizza party at Undyne's house later.
[149:53.77]But for now, I'm gonna just see what's on the next screen.
[149:57.93]Couple of scary guys and a save point.
[149:59.79]Seeing such a strange laboratory in a place like this, you're filled with determination.
[150:07.16]Diddy, get out of my laboratory!
[150:10.56]Sorry.
[150:11.14]Undyne, like, told us there was totally a human in the area.
[150:15.01]So, like, us royal guards are blocking off the elevators for now.
[150:19.31]Yeah, even if the elevators aren't working anymore, we'll do our best.
[150:22.63]Ms. Undyne.
[150:25.78]There.
[150:26.86]What? What? What? What? What? What?
[150:34.85]Like, know where you're getting by us.
[150:37.21]But between you and me, I think you could go through that creepy lab over there.
[150:42.00]Between you, me, and my bro here, I mean.
[150:44.88]Tell him all of my secrets.
[150:47.20]What?
[150:51.62]So I should probably go... Let's see.
[150:53.49]What time is it right now?
[150:57.21]Ah!
[151:00.31]Okay.
[151:06.99]Maybe just a tad longer.
[151:09.08]I do need to finish making my video.
[151:20.28]Creepy guy on a boat.
[151:21.32]Sure, I'll talk to him.
[151:23.07]Tra-la-la, I'm the river man.
[151:24.89]Or am I the river woman?
[151:27.13]Doesn't really matter.
[151:28.51]I'd love to ride in my boat.
[151:29.81]Would you care to join me?
[151:32.33]Yes.
[151:33.64]Where will we go today?
[151:34.50]Hey, look at travel.
[151:36.24]Let's go to, I want to go talk to the fires.
[151:39.12]Let's go.
[151:45.09]Let's go do the pizza party.
[151:51.79]Be aware of the man who speaks in hands.
[151:56.83]Okay.
[152:03.31]Hey, that's where the boat goes.
[152:05.46]Come again sometime.
[152:06.28]All right, Papyrus.
[152:12.80]What the hell's going on here?
[152:18.30]I tried calling Papyrus earlier and he didn't answer.
[152:22.27]That furry person throws ice all day.
[152:23.87]Nobody knows where it goes.
[152:25.23]Papyrus, will you please fucking... Okay, I'll try frowning for once.
[152:31.33]No, I just can't do it.
[152:34.82]Papyrus' house is down here?
[152:39.12]Or is it to the left?
[152:40.33]I think it's to the left.
[152:43.59]Nope, here it is.
[152:46.27]Alright, what's going on?
[152:51.73]Where is he?
[152:52.11]It's a race car bed.
[152:55.36]Neatly made.
[152:56.02]Where the fuck is he?
[152:59.16]Open the closet.
[153:02.38]Where is he?
[153:06.50]What about Sans?
[153:07.08]I know he like plays guitar in his room or something.
[153:08.94]Where is he?
[153:09.88]Door's locked.
[153:19.99]It's locked.
[153:20.57]Oh, she's at Undyne's house.
[153:24.78]Where the fuck is Undyne's house?
[153:28.68]I want to have my pizza party.
[153:43.45]That lady over there has been going for a walk for a while now, but she hasn't moved an inch from where she's standing.
[153:48.25]Well, I haven't either, but I don't want her to notice me over here.
[153:52.65]What?
[153:53.95]Huh?
[153:54.93]Yes, I'm taking my bunny for a walk.
[153:56.82]It's just a very slow one.
[153:58.06]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[154:07.83]Oh, wait a minute.
[154:08.33]Is that the house?
[154:09.71]Is that the house with the fucking house horn?
[154:13.54]Oh, that's the house horn house.
[154:14.86]Okay.
[154:22.44]So I... Is it faster to go this way?
[154:25.22]Is it faster for me to take this walk from Snowdon?
[154:28.76]Or should I go from the waterfall?
[154:32.12]Oh, well.
[154:33.48]Probably easier just to go... I shouldn't have gone back.
[154:41.23]Yeah, let's just go back.
[154:44.18]Waterfall.
[154:54.45]What?
[154:55.83]Since when is it a little dog?
[155:11.00]Can I pet the dog?
[155:17.05]Okie dokie.
[155:21.15]He's up here.
[155:21.83]It's time for a pizza party!
[155:26.83]There he is!
[155:29.95]I asked Undyne if we could outhang, but she said something weird.
[155:33.56]She said she won't hang out with a murderer.
[155:36.16]But I don't remember murdering anyone.
[155:39.78]Though I am a pretty brutal kind of guy.
[155:42.16]Then she said something about wanting to fight some kind of bad guy.
[155:45.63]But she seems very weak from something.
[155:48.03]She stepped out and collapsed in the doorway.
[155:50.33]So I'm just waiting here in case she needs me.
[155:52.91]Since she hates being waited on hand and foot, I think we'll have to hang out later.
[155:58.17]Get me in.
[155:58.71]Get me in your fucking house.
[156:01.47]Someone's there.
[156:01.88]They aren't answering the door.
[156:04.50]Hey, I really doubt we're going to be able to hang.
[156:08.26]It's hard to imagine, but you'll have to spend time with not me.
[156:14.85]Come on.
[156:17.53]Let me in there.
[156:28.32]Where's the fucking pizza party?
[156:36.87]What?
[156:40.79]Open this door right now.
[156:42.13]I know you're having a party in there.
[156:50.73]Why?
[156:51.75]You can't let me in?
[157:07.99]I didn't murder too many people.
[157:09.55]I only killed like three people.
[157:12.77]Well, okay, there was the lady in the beginning, which I thought she was going to try to like capture me.
[157:19.25]So I killed her.
[157:21.35]A couple of frogs along the way.
[157:22.73]The jello, the jello pudding monster.
[157:28.06]One of the rubber ducky monsters.
[157:30.48]Like three guys in the first area.
[157:32.96]Four guys.
[157:33.40]I've killed like 15 people, all right.
[157:37.08]So that's enough for her to be locked out.
[157:39.74]Shouldn't have given her the water.
[157:44.18]Shouldn't have given her the water.
[157:46.03]I should have sealed the deal.
[157:51.01]Locking me out of the pizza party.
[157:52.33]That's bullshit.
[157:55.07]Fuck, I don't even want your pizza anyways.
[157:57.07]Probably sucks.
[157:58.46]Your pizza probably sucks.
[157:59.22]Probably didn't even have pepperoni on it.
[158:01.32]Yeah, fuck you.
[158:03.88]Just go.
[158:11.15]Only 15?
[158:11.39]I think you should be absolved of all charges.
[158:16.38]Why am I going this way?
[158:17.12]I'm going, like, the very, very long way, by the way.
[158:21.36]It'll give me, like, some time to think about what I've done.
[158:23.56]I'm just gonna walk.
[158:32.65]I'm just gonna be sad and walk because I'm not invited to a party.
[158:39.42]Stupid.
[158:44.52]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[158:49.60]You know what?
[158:50.08]You're not going to let me in your pizza parties, huh?
[158:52.96]You're going to call me all kinds of names.
[158:55.11]You're going to make fun of me.
[158:56.61]You're going to say I'm not allowed.
[158:58.75]Well, okie dokie.
[159:03.13]Which one of you wants to die first?
[159:07.61]Hmm.
[159:09.75]Hmm.
[159:11.37]Tough one.
[159:13.31]Oh, fine.
[159:13.99]You know what?
[159:23.18]His charm is losing his shit.
[159:34.32]Oh, he's gonna go all out.
[159:35.74]Fucking murder him.
[159:42.23]That sucks.
[159:45.35]Weird pattern.
[159:51.09]Jerma, calm down.
[159:51.91]Calm down.
[159:52.83]I love how somebody said, Jerma, calm down, and the next person wrote, kill or be killed.
[159:56.85]I can't even go this way. ...
[160:24.08]I'll go to the other village and then I might just call it there.
[160:27.03]You know, the flower in the beginning may have had a point.
[160:34.13]He may have had a pretty decent point.
[160:37.05]And I did see him.
[160:38.37]I did see him.
[160:41.14]I'm sure I'll be seeing more of him.
[160:47.64]I'm going to get to see the dog again.
[160:48.62]What happened to the dog?
[160:54.71]Pet, pet, pet.
[160:55.37]The neck stretches infinitely into the cosmos.
[160:58.93]Don't worry about it.
[161:10.50]Come again sometime.
[161:11.30]Tra-la-la.
[161:12.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[161:15.72]Let's just go in the lab.
[161:18.09]I'm gonna go inside the lab and see what the hell this is about.
[161:23.13]I'm getting cold!
[161:24.29]Getting cold!
[161:25.31]Hey!
[161:28.62]What's with all this stuff?
[161:30.96]Why am I on the TV?
[161:32.66]It's you.
[161:40.10]Um... Is this already been watching me?
[161:44.89]It's too dark to see near the walls.
[161:47.77]Not the dog.
[161:48.37]It's too dark to see near the walls.
[161:52.61]What are they talking about?
[161:59.27]Oh, it's a weird scientist man.
[162:03.25]Oh, it's a dinosaur.
[162:06.70]Oh my god.
[162:08.10]I didn't expect you to show up so soon.
[162:09.74]I haven't showered.
[162:11.20]I'm barely dressed.
[162:12.14]It's all messy and... I'm so sorry.
[162:17.62]You been watching me?
[162:19.66]Um... Hiya!
[162:21.48]I'm Dr. Alphys.
[162:22.84]Alphys or Alphys?
[162:24.62]I'm Asgore's royal scientist!
[162:27.62]B-b-but, uh, I'm not one of the bad guys.
[162:30.69]Actually, since you stepped out of the ruins, I've, um... been observing your journey through my console.
[162:37.11]Oh, console, console.
[162:38.53]Well, yeah, PC gaming, sorry.
[162:40.15]I'm done.
[162:41.37]Stream's over.
[162:42.99]Fucking stream is over.
[162:43.91]Console.
[162:44.67]Okay.
[163:03.94]Your fights, your friendships, everything!
[163:05.90]I was originally going to stop you, but... Watching someone on a screen really makes you root for them.
[163:14.32]So, uh, now I want to help you.
[163:16.63]Using my knowledge, I can easily guide you through Hotland.
[163:20.31]I know a way right to Asgore's castle, no problem.
[163:25.20]Well, actually, um, there's just a tiny issue.
[163:28.64]A long time ago, I made a robot named Mettaton.
[163:33.78]Originally, I built him to be an entertainment robot.
[163:37.34]Uh, you know, like a robotic TV star or something.
[163:41.08]Anyway, recently I decided to make him more useful.
[163:44.04]You know, just some small practical adjustments.
[163:47.17]Like, uh, anti-human combat features.
[163:53.39]Of course, when I saw you coming, I immediately decided I have to remove those features.
[163:58.69]Unfortunately, I may have made a teensy mistake while doing so.
[164:02.82]And now he's an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for human blood.
[164:10.64]But hopefully we won't run into him.
[164:13.04]That's good.
[164:18.42]I'm assuming that's the robot.
[164:22.19]That's definitely the robot.
[164:25.37]I did hear something.
[164:25.95]Yes, I did.
[164:26.69]The robot's coming, I know.
[164:28.99]Here comes the entertainment robot.
[164:32.86]Oh, no.
[164:33.22]Did you just cut the power?
[164:38.66]Oh, yes.
[164:39.86]Welcome, beauties... ...to today's quiz show.
[164:48.29]Oh, boy, I can already tell it's gonna be a great show.
[164:51.87]Everyone give a big hand for our wonderful contestant.
[164:57.97]Never played before.
[164:59.07]Gorgeous.
[165:00.07]No problem.
[165:00.73]It's simple.
[165:01.93]There's only one rule.
[165:03.85]Answer correctly.
[165:04.61]That's it.
[165:07.21]Or you die.
[165:08.71]Oh, fuck.
[165:10.79]Mettaton attacks.
[165:15.01]Uh... Cry.
[165:21.02]Screaming is against the rules.
[165:23.22]Let's start with an easy one.
[165:25.66]What's the prize for answering correctly?
[165:28.77]Money, mercy, more questions.
[165:30.17]New car.
[165:31.61]Haha, you wish wrong.
[165:33.88]The quiz show continues.
[165:34.98]Uh, Mettaton 99.
[165:40.54]That's a lot of defense.
[165:42.10]His metal body renders him invulnerable.
[165:45.07]Here's your terrific prize.
[165:47.63]What's the king's full name?
[165:50.63]Got it.
[165:51.71]Correct!
[165:52.21]What a terrific answer.
[165:53.21]I don't want to cry.
[166:00.50]Enough about you.
[166:01.28]Let's talk about me.
[166:03.68]What are robots made of?
[166:06.99]Metal and magic.
[166:07.99]Metal and magic, right?

[166:22.22]Two trains.
[166:22.68]Train A and Train B. Some station departs Station A. Station B and Station B exist for 225 miles apart from each other.
[166:27.36]Train A is moving at 224 miles per hour towards Station B. Train B is moving at 225 miles per hour towards Station A. This one.
[166:33.08]Fuck.
[166:35.54]I need to heal.
[166:37.54]All I have is a dog salad.
[166:39.80]You ate the dog salad.
[166:40.94]Oh, fried tennis ball.
[166:43.84]Don't count on your victory.
[166:46.30]How many flies are in this jar?
[166:49.50]I don't... I have no idea.
[166:52.23]I have no fucking idea.
[166:54.13]I have to guess.
[166:54.68]54.
[166:55.46]I got it.
[166:57.60]Correct, you're so lucky today.
[166:59.14]The quiz show continues.
[167:05.56]Let's play memory game, oh boy.
[167:08.04]What monster is this?
[167:09.63]That's the frog.
[167:10.89]Frog it.
[167:13.03]What?
[167:15.95]Is that not the frog's name?
[167:19.71]Fuck.
[167:21.07]But can you get this one?
[167:23.15]Would you smooch a ghost?
[167:25.29]Heck yeah.
[167:25.69]Heck yeah.
[167:26.07]Heck yeah.
[167:26.45]Heck yeah.
[167:27.07]Heck yeah.
[167:28.41]Great answer.
[167:29.28]I love it.
[167:34.36]Um... Do I have to keep answering questions?
[167:42.20]Here's a simple one.
[167:44.14]How many letters in the name Mettaton?
[167:45.94]One, two, three...
[167:51.00]I don't know!
[167:52.86]This is not fair!
[167:53.98]This isn't fair!
[168:00.90]Do I have any- I can punch card.
[168:04.73]Spare.
[168:06.61]Fight.
[168:10.75]I can't get hit again.
[168:12.81]Cry.
[168:15.63]Time to break out the big guns.
[168:17.65]What?
[168:18.60]In the dating simulation video game, Mew Mew Kissy Cutie, what is the Mew Mew... I know this one.
[168:23.16]It's the fourth chapter.
[168:24.15]Everyone goes to the beach, and she says, buys ice cream for all her friends for the snail flavor, and she's the only one who wants it.
[168:28.15]It's one of my favorite parts of the game, because it's actually a very powerful message about friendship.
[168:32.59]And... Alphys, Alphys, Alphys!
[168:36.64]You aren't helping our contestant, are you?
[168:39.28]Oh, you should have told me.
[168:41.20]Oh, ask a question.
[168:42.60]You'll be sure to know the answer to... What?
[168:59.47]I don't know.
[168:59.87]I don't fucking know.
[169:06.05]I don't know.
[169:06.35]What is this, 30?
[169:06.87]What is that?
[169:07.65]What is this, 30?
[169:08.35]30?
[169:08.55]It was me.
[169:11.46]Seriously?
[169:12.60]My, my, my, how conceited can you get?
[169:15.24]I love it.
[169:16.58]And while you are completely wrong, you deserve some credit.
[169:19.50]I've seen her watch you on her computer screen, smiling when you succeed, shrieking when you fail, and always, always whispering, no, wrong, you have to go that way.
[169:28.92]In its own way, is this not love?
[169:32.69]Well, well, well.
[169:33.80]With Dr. Ralphies helping you, the show has no dramatic tension.
[169:37.64]We can't come on like this.
[169:39.20]But, but, this was just the pilot episode.
[169:43.08]Next up, more drama, more romance, more bloodshed.
[169:46.80]Until next time, darlings.
[169:49.41]I'm Mettaton blasting off like a fucking psycho.
[169:52.77]I won.
[169:57.25]I won.
[169:58.05]I did it.
[170:00.65]Well, that was certainly something.
[170:09.63]what do I get chicken wait wait wait wait wait let me give you my phone number if you need help okay so I got another phone number yeah
[170:32.50]Where'd you get that number?
[170:34.11]It's ancient.
[170:34.87]Where'd you get that phone?
[170:36.47]It's ancient.
[170:36.83]It doesn't even have texting.
[170:38.99]Wait a second, please.
[170:44.37]What the fuck was that?
[170:45.71]Better phone?
[170:46.95]I upgraded it for you.
[170:48.03]It can do texting items.
[170:49.69]It's got a keychain.
[170:51.63]I even signed you up for the underground's number one social network.
[170:55.93]Now we're officially friends.
[170:57.09]Hee hee.
[170:58.35]Hee hee.
[171:02.94]I'm going to the bathroom?
[171:13.00]Okay.
[171:15.40]What was that all about?
[171:18.76]Can I take a package of noodles?
[171:20.68]Yes.
[171:24.50]Can I turn your screen off now?
[171:25.68]It's kind of creeping me out.
[171:28.22]Hey, can I get in there?
[171:31.97]What are you doing in the bathroom so long?
[171:35.27]What the fuck is that?
[171:36.67]It's a bathroom sign.
[171:37.65]Oh shit.
[171:38.59]Where do I put the hole?
[171:39.73]Can I go in here?
[171:42.52]The space behind the wall is only a few feet wide.
[171:44.92]Really?
[171:53.66]Oh, it's the yogurt machine!
[171:57.42]I love yogurt!
[171:59.53]Pink goop drips from this strange machine.
[172:02.09]Ooh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[172:04.47]It's definitely yogurt.
[172:07.65]Chainsaw, and it looks like Alfie's work table seems dusty.
[172:13.33]Wardrobe is full of dirty lab coats and a single clean dress.
[172:17.73]There are letters from many monsters here.
[172:19.55]Froggit.
[172:20.01]I was right!
[172:20.58]It was Froggit.
[172:22.16]Snowy Doggo.
[172:23.32]They're all unopened.
[172:25.26]It's a lamp with pink fish on the lampshade.
[172:28.12]There's no light bulb.
[172:30.65]An incredible invention.
[172:32.29]When not in use, this bed folds into an extremely easy-to-draw box.
[172:40.28]Did somebody subscribe?
[172:50.79]Did I miss somebody that subscribed?
[172:51.97]Hey, well, welcome to fuckin' shock jockin', give me the shock jock jock jockers!
[173:00.58]That's a good little thing there.
[173:02.64]It's a promo poster for Mettaton's TV premiere.
[173:08.83]On the flap it says, thank you for making my dreams come true.
[173:12.51]Is there anything else I can do up here?
[173:21.89]VHSs and DVDs of various cartoons that are all labeled human history.
[173:27.82]All these books are labeled human history.
[173:29.36]Let's read one.
[173:30.28]You look inside a book.
[173:31.52]It's a comic of a giant robot fighting a beautiful alien princess.
[173:34.98]This doesn't strike you as very accurate.
[173:38.96]Scientific books, they seem very dusty.
[173:46.61]All these books are labeled human... Is there a different one?
[173:50.15]Two scantily clad chefs are flinging energy pancakes at each other.
[173:55.39]This doesn't strike you as very accurate.
[173:57.77]Let's take another one.
[173:59.93]A hideous android is running to school with toast in its mouth.
[174:03.36]Seems like it's late.
[174:05.04]Doesn't strike you as very accurate.
[174:10.38]Okay.
[174:11.86]Let's go down.
[174:13.70]Turn these machines off.
[174:14.61]Turn these machines off.
[174:18.51]Undertale.
[174:20.09]A tale about monsters.
[174:21.79]And friendship.
[174:23.09]Okay.
[174:26.35]Okay.
[174:27.78]Alright, watch this guys, watch this.
[174:31.14]What?
[174:32.64]Why do I have these two phones?
[174:36.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[174:37.93]Dimensional box B?
[174:38.95]What the fuck was that?
[174:40.15]I thought that was somebody's phone number.
[174:41.61]Oh, okay.
[174:44.86]So I can call?
[174:45.70]Do I have two boxes now?
[174:48.88]In my phone?
[174:53.98]Hotland, huh?
[174:55.34]Like the back of my hand.
[174:56.56]Which, since I'm always wearing gloves, I don't know anything about.
[174:59.58]I'm gonna call her.
[175:03.96]Where's her cell phone number?
[175:08.67]Huh?
[175:11.51]I'm gonna freeze in this room.
[175:15.45]Call Toriel.
[175:16.47]Toriel.
[175:18.27]Oh, nobody came.
[175:19.19]Nobody answered.
[175:19.99]It's because I killed her in the beginning.
[175:23.92]So why do I still have her phone number?
[175:25.40]That's pretty weird.
[175:26.18]Oh, he's updated status.
[175:29.38]Just realized I didn't watch Undyne fight the human.
[175:34.48]Am I going to get status updates from people?
[175:41.97]Oh, dear.
[175:43.61]Well, I know she's unbeatable.
[175:44.75]I'll ask her about it later.
[175:49.47]But now I gotta call up the human and guide them.
[175:55.21]What are we doing here?
[175:55.89]This is like a new area.
[176:00.99]Vulcan strolls in.
[176:04.61]Insta-nude, I'm gonna die.
[176:05.92]I'm gonna encourage.
[176:11.24]You tell Vulcan it's doing a great job, its attacks become extreme.
[176:15.98]Does my best.
[176:22.68]Vulcan parades around you proudly.
[176:25.14]Okay, get out of here.
[176:26.16]Am I gonna make it to a village?
[176:33.11]I'm gonna call them in a minute.
[176:36.57]This is a mess.
[176:40.55]Where's the village?
[176:42.11]Where's the village?
[176:42.81]Come on, get me to a save point.
[176:45.81]Save point!
[176:50.88]Ugh.
[176:52.30]Alright.
[176:55.17]I'm cold.
[176:56.27]I've got to go work on my video.
[176:58.67]And I've got to go pee again.
[177:02.71]But anyways.
[177:04.15]Thank you for watching.
[177:05.71]Thanks for coming down.
[177:07.03]Hanging out.
[177:10.38]I may or may not stream again later tonight.
[177:14.86]Or tomorrow or something.
[177:16.91]But I feel like I kind of have to play the rest of this game on stream.
[177:19.87]Because I already streamed, like, you know.
[177:24.89]But we'll see what happens in the conclusion of Undertale.
[177:31.60]Take it easy, guys.
[177:32.56]Have a good rest of your day.
[177:35.36]Thanks again to all the people that subscribed.
[177:38.56]I know I fucking missed a bunch of you, potentially.
[177:41.48]I need to sign up for, like, the Twitch alerts thing.
[177:46.73]Or something like that.
[177:47.75]And where's the German moon emote?
[177:50.31]What happened?
[177:53.09]Where is it?
[177:54.61]Eventually that will go through and there'll be at least one emote on this channel.
[177:59.75]But, yeah.
[178:00.63]Take it easy, everybody.
[178:02.31]Much love.
[178:02.83]Bye-bye.
