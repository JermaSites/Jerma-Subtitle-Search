[00:35.83]Nah, enough for a while.
[00:51.41]Capture it or what?
[00:57.21]There you go.
[01:06.69]Oops.
[01:10.29]Okay, so 20 Minutes to Dawn is a game where you play as a... You're in the middle and you walk around and you shoot stuff.
[01:19.68]It's really good.
[01:20.54]It's really fun.
[01:22.96]We'll give this like... Half an hour?
[01:27.10]Can you show the game list again?
[01:29.44]I don't have a way to do that.
[01:32.40]Alright, so I want to play with... What's a good thing to play with?
[01:36.15]I unlocked a few things.
[01:37.21]What should I do?
[01:39.31]Do it for 20 minutes.
[01:40.73]Maybe 20, 25, 30, maybe 40.
[01:42.17]Maybe an hour.
[01:43.19]Alright, can reroll upgrades.
[01:48.23]Starts with very high HP.
[01:53.09]Play it for 20 minutes.
[01:53.85]We'll see.
[01:55.59]Alright, your bullets have... Alright, um... What should I do for a weapon?
[02:01.74]Bat gun?
[02:02.34]Shoot bats that chase down enemies.
[02:04.04]Bats are both bullets and summons.
[02:06.18]Sure, I'll try it.
[02:07.94]With, uh... You.
[02:13.62]What about my runes?
[02:19.25]Sounds good to me.
[02:22.27]Alright, let's play.
[02:28.88]Standard mode.
[02:30.23]Oh, should I activate this?
[02:32.89]Small enemies spawn more often and small enemies have more HP.
[02:35.65]I feel like that's kind of going to be hard.
[02:39.19]I'm going for it.
[02:39.79]Fuck it.
[02:40.05]Let's do it.
[02:46.06]It's kind of loud.
[02:47.18]Let me help you there.
[02:51.79]This game is sick, by the way.
[02:59.67]I forgot.
[03:03.39]No, there isn't.
[03:04.23]No, no, no, no.
[03:04.65]There's not.
[03:04.99]Alright, the bat is pretty fun.
[03:16.79]20 minutes of this?
[03:25.42]Maybe.
[03:25.80]I don't know.
[03:26.94]Hey, guys.
[03:29.07]This is Omega Gaming Weekend.
[03:32.27]I did not title this stream the next few days.
[03:38.32]That's not what the title says.
[03:40.56]That's not what it says in the title.
[03:46.40]Definitely projectiles.
[03:47.16]100% projectiles.
[03:49.03]This is going to be three, right?
[03:54.97]Oh, oh.
[04:08.66]Are you going to bet on this one?
[04:13.76]Actually, don't bet on this one.
[04:14.82]Alright, these are summons.
[04:18.04]Additional bullet.
[04:20.18]After shooting your last ammo, smite nearby enemies.
[04:22.04]That's pretty good.
[04:22.71]Bullet damage, that's pretty good.
[04:26.07]That's really good.
[04:28.41]Ghost friend is really good.
[04:29.67]Summon and bullets.
[04:30.43]I think I'm going to do this.
[04:35.80]Stop reloading.
[04:38.02]I have auto reload.
[04:40.26]I have auto reload turned on.
[04:47.48]Reload can be canceled in the middle of a reload, so I'm going to keep it on.
[04:51.06]It's actually really helpful.
[04:57.95]This is good so far.
[04:59.01]So far, so good.
[05:02.40]Maybe?
[05:03.22]No.
[05:04.14]Plus one projectile.
[05:05.82]Spread.
[05:06.34]Don't really care.
[05:07.08]Doubles base projectile.
[05:08.02]Whoa, yeah.
[05:15.43]Yep.
[05:19.47]I really hope that whoever is betting right now, you're betting on the right thing.
[05:22.63]Because it's not possible to lose now.
[05:25.40]It's not possible for me to lose.
[05:51.66]I'll be fine.
[05:52.20]Don't worry.
[06:06.67]Alright.
[06:06.91]I need something big here.
[06:13.37]Burn for three seconds.
[06:14.81]Reload rate.
[06:15.77]Huge.
[06:17.57]Shield is huge.
[06:22.27]Bullets can do curse.
[06:23.93]That's pretty good.
[06:26.65]It's probably burn.
[06:28.71]But it also might be reload rate.
[06:31.07]Could be.
[06:31.42]I'll do burn.
[06:37.02]It's bouncing around a lot.
[06:50.21]magic lens nah that one's not bad every second shot lightning strikes when shooting your last ammo 10 bullets go in a circle pretty big freeze is big what do you think freeze or lightning what do you guys think burn ResidentSleeper curse thumbs up lightning you think so I'll do it
[07:22.48]Alright, I gotta stop being an idiot.
[07:52.86]Alright, stop being an idiot.
[07:56.06]Speed.
[07:56.92]Pickup range is big.
[07:57.82]I need movement speed.
[08:02.10]It's impossible to lose.
[08:02.92]Well, it's impossible to lose unless I walk into stuff.
[08:09.25]What just happened?
[08:10.35]Did I pick?
[08:10.77]Oh, I selected it.
[08:11.41]Alright.
[08:11.61]Yeah, I want movement speed.
[08:12.89]So important.
[08:22.24]Alright, come on.
[08:24.00]Should I get the health now?
[08:27.77]Or that?
[08:31.16]Probably that.
[08:32.20]Yeah!
[09:02.66]Yikes!
[09:07.16]Did I get hit?
[09:07.76]No, I didn't.
[09:08.16]I almost did though.
[09:10.08]Alright, summon an egg that will hatch into a dragon in three minutes.
[09:14.07]Reload rate, 20%.
[09:16.49]Summon a ghost friend that shoots piercing bullets.
[09:20.17]Bullet speed, plus 30%.
[09:21.09]Max HP.
[09:35.23]I need damage.
[09:36.35]I'm falling off.
[09:44.64]I'm falling off.
[09:45.20]I need damage so bad.
[09:52.51]Summon a magic dagger that seeks out nearby enemies.
[09:55.59]That's not bad.
[09:56.51]Probably this, though.
[09:57.73]Every fifth shot, launch a fireball.
[10:01.12]Or super speed.
[10:03.28]Every fifth shot launching fireball.
[10:04.84]Yeah, I think that's the one.
[10:06.32]I need damage.
[10:07.76]Give me something good.
[10:12.82]Increase fire rate and reload rate by plus 10% permanently every time you get hit.
[10:17.30]I mean, that's... That's good.
[10:21.99]I don't want to get hit, but if I have to, I will.
[10:40.76]I'll be honest, it's kind of hard to tell if the bats are enemies sometimes.
[10:48.12]Ooh, does that count?
[10:49.42]No.
[10:57.35]It's probably curse, right?
[11:01.39]Gotta take the L. Yeah, it's curse.
[11:23.09]Yeah, we got all kinds of variety on Omega Gaming Weekend.
[11:32.39]This is a nice break.
[11:33.21]Alright, this is where I could lose everything right here.
[11:52.71]It's definitely this one.
[11:56.09]Power shot instead.
[11:56.97]Bullet damage plus... Yeah, fine.
[12:00.07]I'll do it.
[12:00.39]You're right.
[12:00.67]You're right.
[12:00.95]You're right.
[12:01.21]You're right.
[12:01.48]You're right.
[12:01.74]You're right.
[12:02.00]You're right.
[12:10.82]Stupid.
[12:12.96]Stupid.
[12:15.89]It's over.
[12:21.15]It's over.
[12:21.43]It's over.
[12:31.76]Oh my God, this thing takes so much damage.
[12:34.88]I'm sorry.
[12:35.34]I'm sorry to everybody that voted for me.
[12:41.41]I could pull it back though.
[12:46.99]I could, I could pull it back.
[12:48.12]I can pull it back.
[12:48.58]I can.
[12:50.84]You don't understand right angles.
[12:57.50]One of the mods is saying, hey, is Disney Infinity 3.0 actually on the list?
[13:01.74]Yeah, that's a good question.
[13:02.96]It is on the list.
[13:04.11]And it's next.
[13:13.71]Wait, these count as summons.
[13:19.21]These count as summons, right?
[13:20.67]I'm doing it.
[13:21.13]Who cares?
[13:25.21]Hmm.
[13:26.65]That'll kill me, won't it?
[13:31.36]That reload rate debuff is so bad.
[13:40.41]This is probably the safe one.
[13:57.56]I think I may have just saved the whole run.
[14:02.07]I think I saved the entire run.
[14:04.69]Run actually may be saved right now.
[14:09.65]If I get giant.
[14:13.99]Run is saved.
[15:08.98]I think that's fine.
[15:10.12]Turn auto-aim on?
[15:11.04]Why would I turn auto-aim on?
[15:16.76]Lightning damage increased by 12.
[15:17.90]Increased lightning area of effect.
[15:20.50]It's probably that or it's this fast one.
[15:24.34]I'm gonna go fast.
[15:29.67]Am I actually even moving faster?
[15:31.09]I don't feel like I'm moving faster.
[15:34.41]Am I crazy?
[15:45.30]Good.
[15:49.74]That one.
[15:51.79]That one.
[16:18.64]I'm actually kicking my feet right now I thought I moved out of the way I'm dead
[16:55.12]Huh?
[16:57.06]One more try.
[16:57.46]One more try.
[16:57.80]I swear to God.
[16:58.24]One more try.
[16:58.54]One more try.
[16:59.00]And that's it.
[17:00.61]One more try.
[17:01.03]One more try.
[17:01.39]One more try.
[17:01.69]I don't like that weapon.
[17:03.97]Last try.
[17:04.39]Last try.
[17:04.81]One more try.
[17:05.27]That's it.
[17:08.17]That weapon.
[17:08.59]I don't like that weapon.
[17:09.78]I'm going to do grenade launcher.
[17:26.43]What?
[17:26.73]I want to try that.
[17:27.37]That sounds cool.
[17:28.57]With the grenade launcher?
[17:29.39]The grenade launcher is wicked good.
[17:32.49]Alright.
[17:35.33]Bullet damage and... Okay, probably bullet damage.
[17:39.87]And vision range and pickup range.
[17:42.09]Versus... How can I put anything in?
[17:48.53]Holy shit, that's good.
[17:58.06]How much is this?
[18:00.80]3150.
[18:01.42]12,000.
[18:10.68]Alright, let's try this.
[18:16.00]I got Abby and grenade launcher.
[18:21.65]I'm playing on the hard mode.
[18:23.03]So don't tell me I'm not playing on hard mode.
[18:26.61]That seems kind of good.
[18:30.62]It's impossible to lose this.
[18:31.80]Yeah, this is not possible to lose this, by the way.
[18:38.08]So I would vote for me if I were you.
[19:02.74]want here.
[19:04.90]Bullet damage, definitely that.
[19:06.44]And knockback.
[19:07.68]Bullet speed is pretty good.
[19:12.07]Yeah.
[19:12.55]I want huge explosions.
[19:14.37]I don't care about the dragon.
[19:15.97]See the dragon?
[19:16.55]Why?
[19:16.87]I want big explosive bomb stuff.
[19:20.73]Nobody believes in me.
[19:24.95]Get the dragon egg.
[19:25.85]And three minutes of dragon hatches.
[19:29.41]Fine.
[19:31.09]That'll be worth it.
[19:34.37]This had better be worth it.
[19:49.35]Do I still got it?
[19:50.11]Do I still got it?
[19:51.71]Infuri Vostas set on.
[19:55.88]Yup.
[19:57.16]Yes, I do.
[20:02.68]I think it's this.
[20:10.10]I don't have any idea what he says.
[20:12.84]What does the Archmage say in Warcraft 3?
[20:14.88]I don't know what he says.
[20:17.38]In fury for stars set on is all I know.
[20:22.56]What does he actually... I have no idea.
[20:24.28]I've never known.
[20:27.58]In fury for stars set on.
[20:30.96]What does he actually say?
[20:38.35]Any of you know?
[20:40.87]I don't know, dude, don't ask.
[20:41.85]This is from Warcraft 3.
[20:44.35]It's Latin.
[20:49.70]He says, help me, I'm in a Blizzard game.
[20:56.60]Oh, yeah!
[20:57.44]Help me, I'm in a Blizzard game, Satan!
[21:02.72]What does he say?
[21:03.42]Do I have to look this up?
[21:04.49]There's a fucking hundred million people here.
[21:09.07]Do I actually have to look up his voice lines?
[21:15.67]Archmage voice lines Warcraft 3.
[21:20.81]What does he say?
[21:22.61]How does nobody know this?
[21:27.61]Perfect.
[21:30.64]Right.
[21:31.10]Right.
[21:31.42]Right.
[21:32.24]Right.
[21:39.15]I can hardly wait.
[21:41.27]Perfect.
[21:42.77]Whatever.
[21:45.05]Fine.
[21:46.61]To battle.
[21:47.59]Okay.
[21:48.56]For glory.
[21:49.60]Okay.
[21:51.88]There it is.
[21:52.20]Alright.
[21:53.60]The music's too loud.
[21:54.34]Hold on.
[21:54.98]This is important.
[21:56.70]How do I turn the music down?
[21:59.64]How do I turn the music down?
[22:04.49]Okay, here you go.
[22:08.18]This is it right here.
[22:10.84]That's what he says.
[22:13.52]What does he say?
[22:14.08]Whatever.
[22:16.50]Who gives a shit?
[22:18.40]Who cares?
[22:39.45]Alright, let's go.
[22:40.05]What am I doing?
[22:42.03]I don't think I want that.
[22:42.87]Maybe I do.
[22:43.53]Trained dragon.
[22:45.59]He's speaking Swedish?
[22:49.51]Is that Swedish?
[22:51.69]It's not.
[22:53.63]Okay, your dragon gains 10% attack speed every 60 seconds.
[22:58.95]Alright, so let's do that.
[23:00.99]Even in the egg.
[23:01.67]I can't believe nobody knew that.
[23:21.79]How come none of you guys are also like 35 plus year old dorks like me?
[23:25.67]I wonder if it's a rapid fire rate.
[23:31.78]Your dragon gains eight damage every 60 seconds while in the egg as well.
[23:35.71]Okay, well, we're doing all dragon then.
[23:55.30]Alright, dragon again.
[23:57.84]Your bullets deal additional damage equal to 10% of your dragon's damage.
[24:01.00]Well, I mean, we're just doing it.
[24:16.03]Stop.
[24:17.77]Stop!
[24:19.37]Stop!
[24:32.68]this one.
[25:33.98]Yeah, the auto reload is fucking me up.
[25:35.72]Turn it off.
[25:39.33]It's cutting me off.
[25:41.95]How do you reload?
[25:42.49]Alright.
[25:52.28]Come on, man.
[25:54.40]Is it R?
[25:57.54]That's okay.
[25:58.46]This is huge.
[25:59.36]Yeah.
[25:59.86]Huge bullets.
[26:00.66]Huge damage.
[26:09.85]Yes.
[26:10.40]Alright.
[26:10.90]Come on, man.
[26:19.96]I gotta collect.
[26:23.21]Oh my goodness.
[26:23.79]That's right click.
[26:24.41]That's what happens.
[26:24.99]What do we got?
[26:32.99]Double how fast Abby fires during her special.
[26:35.22]Sure.
[26:41.25]Should I take the health or bullet damage and piercing?
[26:43.99]I don't know.
[26:52.77]Why do you not have any pupils?
[26:59.30]Can you see?
[27:02.08]I do.
[27:02.52]It's just the way the lighting is.
[27:04.34]Come on.
[27:08.20]Maybe it is ghost friend.
[27:10.89]Or should we just do all damage?
[27:12.93]Always.
[27:17.15]They pierce killed enemies.
[27:22.80]Maybe I'll be safe.
[27:24.82]Yeah, I'll be safe.
[27:26.04]I have plenty of damage right now.
[27:31.52]I have to wrap around and go in the middle there.
[27:39.68]Alright, dragon's here.
[27:40.62]Finally.
[27:42.14]What's the dragon doing for damage?
[27:43.10]42.
[27:44.62]That's actually really good.
[27:58.61]Bullet speed.
[28:01.21]That's huge.
[28:02.16]Yeah, I think it's that.
[28:03.64]It's either that or it's... I don't know.
[28:07.54]Haste?
[28:07.78]Haste?
[28:13.32]I don't have any move speed.
[28:17.14]It has to be this.
[28:17.70]Yeah.
[28:18.18]There's nothing else it would be.
[28:24.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:25.95]Bad idea.
[28:26.53]Bad idea.
[28:27.29]Bad idea.
[28:27.87]Bad idea.
[28:28.37]Bad idea.
[28:28.95]Very bad idea.
[28:29.65]These hurt me.
[28:32.35]That was a terrible idea.
[28:34.33]Whose idea was that?
[28:37.48]That's... This... It runs over.
[28:39.26]It runs over.
[29:04.51]I didn't know that it was... I didn't know that that was going to do that.
[29:07.89]I thought it was going to explode into just little pellets, not into other bombs that... This is the last try.
[29:13.83]And then we're going to play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[29:22.49]I actually like this weapon, but now that I... Alright, let's go.
[29:25.15]Come on.
[29:26.61]I'm going both headphones for this, by the way.
[29:49.38]We'll do the same thing.
[29:50.24]Dragon egg.
[29:51.94]It's really early.
[30:10.59]Dragon.
[30:12.01]Eight more damage every 60 seconds.
[30:14.37]It's super early.
[30:36.32]Dragon again.
[30:37.21]Super early.
[30:53.77]That's really dangerous with this character.
[31:04.04]Oh my goodness!
[31:39.53]That move is not something I should be doing, ever.
[31:42.38]Unless it's an absolutely desperate scenario.
[31:44.30]10% attack speed?
[31:55.23]Yes.
[31:57.65]When this dragon hatches, it's going to be better.
[31:59.51]I need blast radius or something, right?
[32:35.81]Collect.
[32:46.72]Double, yeah.
[33:03.80]Wrap around, I need that shit.
[33:15.86]Alright, I'm a little more confident than I just was.
[33:17.60]I am way more confident now.
[33:24.58]Surprise as a face cam?
[33:26.05]I started doing face cam every case.
[33:27.19]So I played Elden Ring for a month straight with a face cam on and I just never turned it off after not doing face game for like almost 10 years.
[33:33.97]Very rarely if I did a horror game or something.
[33:39.17]Yeah, big shot.
[33:44.25]That's much better.
[33:54.13]Alright, there we go.
[33:55.03]Let's go!
[34:10.42]Give us the chest.
[34:12.20]Move speed and reload rate by 35% for two seconds after reloading.
[34:15.50]Pretty good.
[34:16.12]Wait.
[34:21.26]That's not good.
[34:25.10]That's not good.
[34:25.62]Because that is going to come out of nowhere and I'm going to run into something.
[34:30.70]It is good.
[34:31.56]But I'm used to moving at a certain, you know, knots per second, whatever.
[34:36.04]And if I just speed up randomly after killing... I'm going to hit something.
[34:41.05]For two seconds?
[34:43.51]Okay, after reloading, I'm going to be going like this.
[34:46.37]I'm going to reload.
[34:47.63]And then I'm going to stop.
[34:48.33]I don't want to adapt.
[34:51.27]I already know how the character moves.
[34:56.00]This fell on the ground and I'm gonna do this.
[35:01.64]Now it's new.
[35:15.54]Ew.
[35:28.49]This boomer is incapable of adapting.
[35:30.23]Okay, all the people that are telling me to take this, then fine.
[35:32.58]When I die, you go, wow, I can't believe I trusted him.
[35:36.74]Then you'll see.
[35:43.63]No, it's not this.
[35:47.19]No, it is.
[35:47.57]It is.
[35:49.15]No, it's this.
[35:49.85]It's holy shield for sure.
[35:51.07]Just eat a free damage.
[35:52.21]Yeah, it's that.
[35:54.57]Let's go.
[36:06.05]I have so much damage, it's just a question of if I'm going to end up killing myself.
[36:11.17]Like, accidentally with the explosion.
[36:12.93]I can do that.
[36:24.74]Yep.
[36:35.00]What?
[36:36.90]Dragon is sick, by the way.
[36:38.22]Alright, come on.
[36:40.54]Reload rate 20%.
[36:42.10]That's very good.
[36:44.72]We want that.
[36:45.28]Look at how fast I am.
[37:24.45]10%.
[37:24.69]Ooh.
[37:26.79]That's good too.
[37:29.74]I think it's this.
[37:30.96]The ammo and the reload, right?
[37:31.86]Alright, here we go.
[37:43.99]Don't blow it.
[38:00.76]Yeah, yeah, OK.
[38:04.94]Something in my teeth.
[38:05.68]Bullet bounce some oh boy.
[38:12.64]Is this bad?
[38:32.47]I have the dragon.
[38:33.17]The dragon is doing 40 damage.
[38:35.44]So do I want the dragon to be doing... What?
[38:39.84]Like 60 to 70 damage?
[38:42.30]And me be able to shoot and kind of supplement the dragon?
[38:45.59]I don't... This is going to bounce off people and come back, explode, and kill me.
[38:53.19]We're not doing that.
[38:58.74]This is awful.
[38:59.32]These are all bad.
[39:00.72]Triple your base max ammo, but 50% less damage.
[39:08.28]I'm not taking it.
[39:08.88]It's not happening.
[39:16.78]Not happening.
[39:38.90]I didn't take it.
[39:39.78]No, I'm not taking it.
[39:40.52]It's a bad idea.
[39:48.29]Curse?
[39:53.74]Health was going to be the second thing I was going to do.
[40:11.75]I want this box to go away, please.
[40:16.09]I... whatever.
[41:07.94]I knew that was going to happen.
[41:08.89]I was going to get too close to the explosion.
[41:43.56]you need to start pretending start pretending what pretend what it's fresh clip first one that's actually a real yeah that's a good choice you're right
[42:14.83]What the fuck?
[42:16.01]Oh, it was whatever.
[42:17.21]OK, come on.
[42:18.45]Don't lose it now.
[42:27.94]This one.
[42:37.90]They're so fast.
[43:01.15]Okay.
[43:07.81]As much as you're... This isn't going to do 100-something damage.
[43:09.63]This isn't going to be huge.
[43:46.24]I think I want to do pick up range at this point.
[43:49.50]Curse is good, but I need to level.
[43:50.92]I have to.
[43:51.88]I have to level up.
[43:52.99]I need to be able to pick stuff up.
[44:10.06]Am I invincible during that?
[44:11.71]I feel like I just was.
[44:13.47]Can somebody confirm?
[44:19.27]Fuck, I'm losing it.
[44:22.93]It's the piercing.
[44:24.29]The piercing is fucking me up.
[44:27.51]The piercing is fucking me up because I'm shooting.
[44:29.75]I'm expecting it to blow up on somebody, but it goes through them and blows up after them.
[44:33.59]That was a mistake.
[44:35.53]Sorry, all the believers.
[44:37.14]This might be a problem.
[44:42.23]This might be a problem.
[45:05.77]See what I mean?
[45:06.43]See what I mean?
[45:07.43]It's nothing I can do about it.
[45:08.99]It's going through people and I can't walk forward.
[45:10.65]Because if I walk forward and I shoot somebody, I'm going to get hit by the explosion.
[45:15.78]I fucked it up.
[45:21.44]It's alright.
[45:23.38]It's alright.
[45:23.88]Alright.
[45:24.46]Alright.
[46:14.85]How much does this cost?
[46:44.95]This game's fun.
[46:45.91]Alright, goodbye.
[46:46.99]Alright, we're moving on.
[46:47.61]Moving on.
[46:47.92]Moving on.
[46:48.24]Alright.
[46:48.54]Alright.
[46:48.78]Alright.
[46:49.00]Alright.
[46:49.18]We're moving on.
[46:51.02]Moving on.
[46:52.96]We're moving on.
[47:03.28]That was so much fun.
[47:08.81]Okay, so...
[47:12.71]You know what I'm going to do?
[47:14.41]I'm going to take a nice cold shower.
[47:16.91]Not cold, but lukewarm.
[47:18.15]It's going to be great.
[47:20.93]I did, in that big break, I did a witch hazel wipe.
[47:27.97]Just a little.
[47:30.29]Freshen me up a bit.
[47:38.14]Felt good.
[47:41.14]Skincare stream.
[47:47.55]Peep the elbow.
[47:53.91]It's fine.
[47:54.75]It's just because I'm sitting here with my elbows on it for a while.
[48:00.27]5 a.m.
[48:00.47]Eastern.
[48:01.06]We're getting close.
[48:04.30]Okay, let me... Oh, there we go.
[48:15.01]Alright, I hope this is not too intense.
[48:20.89]We'll find out.
[48:28.17]Because of the camera saturation that it looks like that, probably.
[48:30.67]Let me see.
[48:36.58]Yeah, it's just there's a lot of effects on this right now because we put them on to try to make the camera look better.
[48:47.96]Twitch Tracker says the longest stream was 13 hours and 5 minutes.
[48:52.71]Can somebody go confirm?
[48:55.61]To make sure that that's the case.
[48:56.75]Let me just go.
[49:02.57]I get to 13 hours and 5 minutes and then I'm like, hooray, let's turn it off.
[49:06.30]And it was actually like 13 hours and like 10 minutes.
[49:16.83]You should go for 14 hours just to be safe.
[49:19.27]But I will go... Combine the Fellowship and Two Towers mods.
[49:26.71]Okay.
[49:29.09]Yeah, I'm good for... I'm okay.
[49:31.19]I still got this.
[49:32.49]I drank this whole thing.
[49:34.05]So... I'm gonna do high HP.
[49:38.58]And the bow.
[49:42.66]Maybe not.
[49:43.14]What's my... What's my item I haven't played with?
[49:44.58]Dual SMGs.
[49:49.69]Upgrades apply separately to each gun.
[49:52.81]That's interesting.
[49:58.09]Are these good?
[50:04.10]I feel like I could have gotten this to work really well.
[50:05.70]Let me try the bow.
[50:06.34]Let me see if I can make this work.
[50:17.52]When I reload, they come back.
[50:22.83]So you want insane reload speed then.
[50:24.69]You want reload speed, ammo, and piercing.
[50:31.32]I walked into the tree.
[50:33.74]I forgot that the tree was evil.
[51:01.94]Oh my God, you're gambling on this.
[51:04.40]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[51:05.36]These all aren't that great for this.
[51:13.91]Vision range.
[51:22.91]Oh, maybe like that's safe.
[51:41.58]I'm all in, I have to believe.
[51:43.42]Oh, I appreciate it.
[51:57.49]Yeah, I need way more reload than that.
[52:04.39]Reload speed.
[52:05.27]Fire rate, that would be good.
[52:06.45]Uh, it's fire rate.
[52:23.53]I thought I got out of that.
[52:28.49]Okay.
[52:29.27]Bullet damage and knockback or more projectiles?
[52:33.37]Probably that because of the pullback.
[52:38.82]Why do all these people have ones and twos on them?
[52:42.50]One, two.
[52:43.04]What's with the one and the two?
[53:14.36]He doesn't know.
[53:15.20]I don't know.
[53:18.26]Oh, it's the prediction choices.
[53:19.96]Okay.
[53:20.26]So you're going to be kind of in little groups of one, two, three, or four, huh?
[53:27.91]Very interesting.
[53:34.31]Ghost friend?
[53:39.61]Just one or two?
[53:42.61]Predicted.
[53:43.07]Yeah.
[53:43.71]Oh, I thought it was.
[53:44.31]Oh, no, it's not a poll.
[53:46.35]Wait, can't you do more than?
[53:48.21]Oh, no.
[53:48.75]I thought.
[53:48.99]Okay.
[53:49.15]I thought it was a poll for a second.
[53:51.96]That's been 13 hours.
[54:01.68]I'm good.
[54:02.00]Don't worry about me.
[54:03.00]I'm fine.
[54:05.27]I'm fine.
[54:05.79]I'll be okay.
[54:08.85]I really thought that there was four options.
[54:17.34]Did he predict yes or no?
[54:18.68]How about yes to and no to?
[54:25.58]There's no way he's going to beat this with the least amount of brain cells.
[54:32.33]You know what's crazy?
[54:33.47]I think that that would make it easier because I'm not sitting here going like, oh my God, I have to watch out.
[54:40.03]Look out for those bad guys.
[54:41.11]How much health do I have?
[54:42.03]No, I'm just kind of like just sitting here.
[54:47.08]I don't know.
[54:47.40]You may have picked wrong.
[54:48.28]Depends.
[54:50.16]Let's see when the boss comes out.
[54:54.43]That's better.
[55:00.05]Yeah, it's that fire rate and ammo.
[55:11.83]I would love more projectiles.
[55:20.70]Bullet bounce.
[55:23.60]Bullet speed.
[55:24.48]That's OK.
[55:25.90]Dark Arts is pretty good.
[55:31.41]Probably the fire rate.
[55:32.11]10% is bad though.
[55:33.69]I'll do Dark Arts.
[55:45.42]I beat the ULTRAKILL Act 2 campaign seven hours ago.
[55:50.12]I forgot I did that.
[55:53.30]It's absolutely been an omega gaming weekend.
[55:56.98]Day.
[55:59.22]Friday.
[56:00.20]Remember the fish game?
[56:06.00]Oh yeah.
[56:06.98]That game was fun.
[56:17.50]I genuinely enjoyed that game.
[56:19.39]Oh boy.
[56:19.67]Alright, give me some good.
[56:29.53]I hate this one.
[56:31.19]But, I mean, why not?
[56:32.09]Take it.
[56:38.63]That's kinda good.
[56:40.21]Yeah.
[56:42.31]Yeah.
[56:47.15]Well, I'll take the, uh... Remember when I ate the french bread pizza?
[56:58.63]It was great.
[57:00.13]Delicious.
[57:01.55]Just in case you forgot.
[57:12.66]Oh my god, are you serious?
[57:15.75]Oh, guys, there's still a piece left.
[57:18.65]I still have half a piece left.
[57:24.54]Oh, my.
[57:25.56]So good.
[57:27.78]Hold on.
[57:45.72]I'm hitting E instead of W.
[58:28.48]These all kind of suck.
[58:30.35]Well, for what I'm doing.
[58:42.06]This character is really cool, though.
[58:42.98]I like the mechanic.
[58:54.59]How are you still alive?
[59:02.39]Holy shit.
[59:05.47]Shield.
[59:31.56]Alright.
[59:32.42]Movement speed.
[59:33.74]Big.
[59:35.16]Bullet damage, bullet size, and piercing.
[59:37.56]Big.
[59:42.02]It's that.
[59:44.62]Fire rate, but still, the damage is crazy.
[59:47.87]I was here.
[59:48.31]Wait, did I do it?
[59:51.23]Is this officially the longest stream I've ever done?
[59:57.11]Alright.
[60:01.89]Cool.
[60:04.13]13 hours and five minutes.
[60:07.61]And I didn't drop a single frame unless I downloaded the game.
[60:12.66]Cool.
[60:17.22]You know, it's really funny.
[60:18.96]I really, okay.
[60:19.80]So when was that Lord of the Rings stream?
[60:22.70]2017, 2018.
[60:33.66]2019 four years ago.
[60:39.44]I think I'm on record saying after when I took that big break, when I was gone for like three months, it was on January 11th, 2020.
[60:49.26]Okay.
[60:49.44]So it hasn't been that long, but I think when I came back from the long break, like four months, I think I said, I will never, ever do a stream.
[61:00.54]That's longer than 12 hours ever again.
[61:13.19]Guess not.
[61:17.99]So what now?
[61:18.75]Every second I'm setting the tone for it's got to be a number that I want, right?
[61:24.45]It's got to be a number that I like.
[61:25.55]13.
[61:25.57]I don't like 13, though.
[61:30.70]13.
[61:30.72]13 is an odd number.
[61:49.63]It's not that much longer.
[61:50.45]Okay, how about 13... Wait.
[61:55.35]Dude, what if I do... Oh, watch this shit.
[61:58.89]Everyone's going to hate me for this.
[62:00.45]1337 is so dumb.
[62:02.47]It's the absolute worst number.
[62:05.57]It's funny because I could do that and that would be it forever.
[62:08.07]133737.
[62:08.09]But 133700, it's so bad.
[62:10.22]But I think, actually, I might...
[62:20.25]be mad that I did that.
[62:23.17]Months or years later, I might be like, really?
[62:25.57]That's what I decided to do.
[62:31.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 would have been so perfect.
[62:37.88]But it's too bad 12 hours was, uh, 12 hours and 56 minutes.
[62:42.92]12 hours and 45 minutes, whatever.
[62:46.08]I would have loved 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[63:12.01]No, that's cool.
[63:12.99]I really didn't think I was ever going to do this ever again.
[63:14.60]And like I said, I know that a 13 hour stream is really not.
[63:27.61]It's not like wow, oh my God.
[63:31.05]One of the only streamers ever to do a 13 at that.
[63:33.79]I know people do this regularly all the time.
[63:38.22]But I'm an old man.
[63:43.84]I'm not even sure I would be able to do more than 1413 or 14 hours back when I was 20.
[63:47.18]I don't know.
[63:50.02]I don't know how people do it.
[63:54.92]You know what it is?
[63:57.76]It's not just the fact that you're, whatever, 13 hours.
[64:00.98]There are a lot of people that work 13 hour days, 12 hour days, 10 hour shifts, right?
[64:08.29]It's a lot.
[64:10.01]I think the major difference with something like a stream is
[64:14.67]I've been kind of sitting in the same spot.
[64:18.67]I've gone to the bathroom once or twice.
[64:21.11]And I've eaten pizza at the desk for like 14 hours.
[64:24.17]So it's like the low amount of movement is I think like the killer.
[64:31.05]And like the visual stimulation I think is what it is.
[64:36.24]But yeah, let me be very, very, very clear.
[64:39.82]The reason why I don't do 10 plus hour streams is because I don't want to, right?
[64:49.32]Get up once in a while and do stretches?
[64:51.28]Yeah.
[64:56.00]You do a lot of content for 14 hours.
[64:59.88]Um, I mean...
[65:06.29]For me, it's not... Maybe, I don't know.
[65:08.29]I'm trying to think of the way that I could word it.
[65:09.75]I think I expel a lot of energy on stream.
[65:17.25]A lot.
[65:20.66]It's the end.
[65:24.50]I think it's just kind of the way that I am.
[65:36.44]But yeah, it's not, I'm not trying to say that like, oh my God, guys, screaming is so hard.
[65:41.88]No, no, it's not what I'm saying.
[65:53.10]Would you ever do a 24 hour?
[65:53.86]No, not in a million years.
[65:57.05]Not in a hundred million years.
[66:17.44]What about a thousand million years?
[66:21.30]Yeah, it's just my body and brain just can't do that for more than like 10 to 12 hours usually.
[66:26.78]After hour number five or six is when I'm kind of like, yeah, I'm done.
[66:30.02]But look, more power to you if you can really do that for more than 12, 13, 14 hours all the time.
[66:35.74]Although I would say that it's probably not that healthy to do this that often.
[66:44.89]Another one of the reasons why I don't really do this that often is because I have a lot of health problems.
[66:50.07]And I could really probably fuck myself up if I did too much.
[66:54.18]1313's coming up.
[66:54.88]That's kind of interesting.
[66:56.50]131313?
[66:58.10]Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[67:02.74]You can burn out.
[67:04.98]Yeah, I don't want to burn out either.
[67:06.09]That's another thing too.
[67:06.99]I really don't want to burn out.
[67:10.65]Kind of interesting.
[67:16.81]I think you can... When you go through all your oil and there's not much left, it's really long-term.
[67:26.81]It's really not great for you.
[67:27.59]It's really not a good thing.
[67:30.32]Is he sleepy?
[67:31.12]I'm kind of sleepy.
[67:31.88]13, 13.
[67:31.92]13, 13?
[67:34.60]No, no.
[67:34.82]Let's wind down.
[67:35.46]It ends when it ends.
[67:48.62]This game is really fun, though, too.
[67:49.66]20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[67:57.20]Um... What do we see here?
[68:07.09]Let me see.
[68:07.69]How was I at the end of that Two Towers VOD?
[68:17.25]Wait, how come Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is 9 hours and 40 minutes?
[68:23.10]How come this is shorter?
[68:23.98]It was two VODs.
[68:34.14]Oh, it's split up by the game, okay.
[68:44.29]Okay.
[68:45.67]There's a 12-hour limit.
[68:47.49]Ah, right.
[68:47.85]Okay.
[68:50.01]Yeah, so that's going to be the end of the stream.
[68:52.61]I'll see you guys later.
[68:53.25]I don't... Omega Weekend sort of turned into Beat My Old Longest Stream Ever record.
[69:00.50]I guess... I guess they are one and the same.
[69:04.98]But I do still have a dozen and a half more games to play.
[69:17.19]So, these don't have to go away.
[69:20.64]Keep an eye on the sus.
[69:23.30]If it's Sunday or Monday, maybe it'll be Sunday.
[69:26.04]It's definitely not going to be tomorrow.
[69:27.74]Or today.
[69:28.74]What is it, like 6am for a lot of you guys?
[69:31.20]10am?
[69:32.06]Saturday?
[69:36.01]I'll play Splatoon 3 and I'll play... I want to do a Switch night.
[69:41.97]Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, some other things that are on Switch.
[69:46.48]Or maybe I'll just play Breath of the Wild.
[69:48.74]It's time to play it, right?
[69:50.14]Should I just do it?
[69:50.94]I don't know.
[69:56.86]Is it time to just do it at some point in the next week?
[69:59.73]Next few days?
[70:09.14]Yes.
[70:10.62]Okay.
[70:15.76]Please stream on the weekends for us working Andes.
[70:22.01]I like streaming on the weekends.
[70:29.19]Breath of the Wild is a perfect game for you.
[70:34.61]Put sus for Saturday or Sunday?
[70:35.95]I would put sus for Sunday.
[70:39.77]Sunday slash Monday.
[70:48.37]Gears of War is on Switch.
[70:53.71]Omega Weekend.
[70:54.77]Until Monday.
[70:59.14]Um, I don't know.
[71:01.28]Who knows?
[71:01.64]I might just show up.
[71:02.50]Just go.
[71:06.62]Hey, well, hey, can I trade you Omega Weekend for Omega Record Stream Breaker?
[71:16.09]We'll see.
[71:16.45]I don't know.
[71:17.41]It's very possible that tomorrow or Sunday, I'm just like, whatever, let's go.
[71:22.94]No.
[71:34.03]Oathbreaker.
[71:35.15]That's not what we agreed to, Elbertson.
[71:37.21]We didn't agree to this.
[71:42.00]I'll be back in here tomorrow afternoon to increase or offline chat.
[71:46.40]We'll figure it out.
[71:55.27]What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?
[71:59.75]Wait, can I do that?
[72:02.03]Wait, hold on.
[72:02.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:03.39]Is that, can I do that?
[72:05.73]How do I do that?
[72:07.61]Can I actually do that right now?
[72:12.61]Yeah?
[72:13.35]Wait, how?
[72:14.15]Does anybody know?
[72:25.91]Do slash moment.
[72:29.21]Slash moment.
[72:31.49]Clip moments on stream and recognize viewers that were there with a commemorative badge.
[72:37.31]Oh, okay, so... Hold on.
[72:41.12]Uh-oh.
[72:44.03]Like right now?
[72:44.99]What if I do this?
[72:45.51]So I go like this?
[72:52.35]If you're seeing this clip right now, you were one of the few people that were here for my longest stream ever.
[73:00.54]13 hours, 18 minutes, and 37 seconds.
[73:10.63]Thanks for hanging out.
[73:13.45]And now, do I do it now?
[73:16.13]13 hours and 20 minutes.
[73:21.37]Moment time.
[73:23.49]Reward viewers for being part of this moment.
[73:25.97]Viewers of this moment will receive a clip added to their moments page.
[73:30.44]You have five moments for this month.
[73:33.04]From my longest stream ever.
[73:34.76]13 hours, 18 minutes, and 37 seconds.
[73:40.84]Oh, it worked.
[73:44.82]Thanks.
[73:45.70]Hanging out.
[73:47.64]And now, do I do it now?
[73:48.92]No, no, no, no.
[73:49.64]Hold on.
[73:49.96]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[73:50.59]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[73:51.31]Hold on.
[73:51.59]I know.
[73:51.79]I probably want to go to bed.
[73:52.95]That was not a good one.
[73:55.31]Slash.
[73:55.91]Okay, here we go.
[73:56.51]Ready?
[74:02.14]You were here.
[74:03.82]for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.
[74:07.80]13 hours, 19 minutes and 41 seconds.
[74:12.70]Ain't never going to happen again.
[74:16.96]What?
[74:17.70]What?
[74:18.12]Yeah.
[74:18.70]Let's start over.
[74:20.34]Hey, you.
[74:25.98]I feel like I'm making a YouTube video again.
[74:29.55]I feel like I'm making a fucking YouTube video again.
[74:31.15]You don't know how many times I would sit here and do this shit.
[74:33.87]I would sit here over and over and over and over again doing this.
[74:38.49]Hey, you!
[74:41.43]I used to sit... I can't do it.
[74:43.85]Okay, I'm just gonna close my eyes.
[74:45.41]No, I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna look over here.
[74:47.69]I'm not gonna look at you.
[74:54.57]You are one of the few people that stuck around and checked out the longest stream that I've ever done.
[75:02.26]13 hours, 21 minutes and seven seconds.
[75:08.26]You did.
[75:09.50]You were here for it.
[75:10.78]You were here.
[75:12.68]Thanks a lot.
[75:13.88]And now I think it's time I got a little bit of rest.
[75:20.63]How was that?
[75:26.80]I look fucking crazed!
[75:28.64]No, we're not doing that one.
[75:30.19]We're doing a different one.
[75:57.47]Hey, just want to say thanks.
[75:59.75]You were here for the longest stream that I've ever done.
[76:03.25]13 hours, 21 minutes, and 38 seconds.
[76:08.59]You were here.
[76:11.05]You were here.
[76:13.01]If you have this moment, if you got this clip, congratulations, you own it now.
[76:18.33]Now it's time to get some rest.
[76:22.19]Alright, I did it.
[76:22.83]That should be good, right?
[76:38.79]God, dude.
[76:40.94]Who cares?
[76:41.56]Like, this is the... Who cares?
[77:08.54]Go watch that.
[77:15.90]It's so... I screw it up so bad, but who cares?
[77:21.22]Did you get... Did it work?
[77:27.39]Did you claim it?
[77:34.77]I claimed it.
[77:35.53]Alright, cool.
[77:36.69]I feel bad for the people that left.
[77:40.57]There's like a couple thousand people left because they're like, oh, the stream's over and they're not going to get the clip.
[77:47.20]I feel kind of bad for that.
[77:52.18]Wait, what is it?
[77:53.76]Moments badge.
[77:56.54]Why is the moments badge the body of Christ?
[78:06.95]What the?
[78:08.03]Okay.
[78:09.87]You got a moment badge.
[78:12.09]Alright.
[78:13.91]Am I, did I officially do it?
[78:15.19]I'm so afraid to hit end stream and it turns out, oh dude, it was actually 13 minutes in like 34 minutes or 13 hours and 34 minutes or something.
[78:28.73]Should I do another moment?
[78:35.76]Like the 200 people that just left, you fucked up.
[78:40.70]Hey, just want to say, you are one of the only people to get this clip of my longest stream.
[78:48.96]13 hours, 24 minutes, and 25 seconds.
[78:54.31]That's right.
[78:56.11]This is the longest one I've ever done.
[78:58.61]Thanks for watching.
[79:00.25]It's time for me to get some rest.
[79:05.66]Did it work?
[79:15.74]A clip of the moment has failed to capture... What are you talking about?
[79:25.16]Hey.
[79:32.77]I got banned?
[79:33.53]No, I didn't.
[79:37.42]I just want to say... You are one of the lucky people... Why am I banned?
[79:44.13]You're one of the lucky people that got this moment, my longest stream ever, at 13 hours, 25 minutes, and 24 seconds.
[79:53.47]Nobody else has this but you.
[79:56.14]This few people.
[79:58.22]The longest stream I've ever done.
[80:00.14]Congratulations, you were here.
[80:01.94]You were here.
[80:03.42]Time to get some rest.
[80:09.39]Okay.
[80:09.49]Okay.
[80:19.50]Okay.
[80:20.16]Create moment.
[80:22.36]It failed.
[80:27.03]Can I only do this once every ten minutes?
[80:29.75]I have four more moments to capture this month.
[80:34.79]I think I'm just going to do this every ten minutes.
[80:36.71]And if you want to claim this moment, you better stay to the end.
[80:47.90]Do all five of them tonight.
[80:51.90]Can I look this up?
[80:53.20]When do these moments reset?
[80:58.39]Do all five tonight.
[81:04.99]That's... It's in beta?
[81:10.24]At the start of the... Yeah, I still have four I can do this month.
[81:14.14]I wonder how long the cooldown is.
[81:23.92]Hey, just want to say, you know what time it is?
[81:28.00]It's the longest stream ever.
[81:32.57]13 hours, 27 minutes, and 6 seconds.
[81:36.01]I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.
[81:41.05]Thanks for joining me.
[81:41.99]Thanks for sticking around for this long.
[81:43.21]I've never gone this long before, and you were here for it.
[81:47.32]Thanks for sticking around.
[81:49.16]We're here.
[81:50.58]We're hanging out.
[82:28.82]I'm doing all five of these tonight.
[82:39.96]So it looks like it's about five minutes.
[82:54.80]The last one, I should just be standing back there.
[82:58.37]Just going like... You... You powered through.
[83:03.29]You made it all the way to the end.
[83:05.57]You must be commended for it with this fifth moment.
[83:09.76]And then I spin around, bend over forward, and fart wicked fucking loud into the microphone.
[83:23.78]Make the camera wider.
[83:24.82]Yeah, just get them progressively more fucking weird.
[83:31.00]Hold on.
[83:31.32]I was like... Hey!
[83:42.25]Just wanted to say... I am so happy that you made it to tonight's stream.
[84:05.87]Hold on a second.
[84:35.44]The camera quality is going to get progressively worse.
[84:39.48]So the actual one that you get is going to be the worst one.
[84:41.62]Uh-oh.
[85:02.71]Where did I go?
[85:27.13]I think I actually broke the webcam.
[85:39.44]Oh, shit.
[85:41.08]Oh, no!
[85:41.66]It's actually fucked up.
[85:43.66]Hold on.
[85:52.76]Oh, shit!
[85:57.61]Wait, hold on.
[85:58.30]I might be able to fix it.
[86:04.84]Yeah, it's gone.
[86:09.03]Hold on.
[86:09.43]Did I get it back?
[86:14.35]Oh, I think I got it.
[86:15.35]Hold on a second.
[86:15.89]We're good.
[86:31.22]Let's see, am I good?
[86:31.86]Um... Maybe?
[86:50.32]You can't see, though.
[86:50.98]Alright, the cooldown's up, I gotta fucking do it.
[87:01.03]I don't know.
[87:01.85]What is that?
[87:13.70]Oh, it's my fucking neck.
[87:24.29]Okay, I got it.
[87:31.86]That looks fine, right?
[87:37.86]Okay.
[87:38.04]Okay, you ready?
[87:59.82]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[88:02.69]13 hours and 33 minutes.
[88:04.49]You made it.
[88:06.05]You made it to the longest stream that I've ever done.
[88:08.83]You got all the way through.
[88:09.85]You were here for this.
[88:11.71]You were here.
[88:13.85]Special thank you to everybody that decided to show up and stick around.
[88:20.58]I got a crunch for you.
[88:22.88]Now that one sucked.
[88:23.76]Again.
[88:23.94]Hey.
[88:33.49]Just want to say a huge special thanks to those of you that stuck around for the longest stream that I have ever done.
[88:41.57]We're talking, wow, wowee, 13 hours and 34 minutes with 18 seconds also, which is unbelievable.
[88:53.43]Thank you for sticking around.
[88:54.65]This is the longest stream.
[88:55.45]I'm never going to do this again.
[88:56.59]Longest stream ever done.
[88:57.54]Thank you.
[89:07.74]Did it work?
[89:14.66]Let's go even lower.
[89:15.50]Okay.
[89:22.14]Let's make it worse.
[89:24.48]I hate that I have to do this every time though.
[89:35.20]Oh my goodness.
[89:41.95]Really?
[89:42.31]This looks so bad.
[89:44.11]Um...
[90:11.38]I can't even see it anymore.
[90:12.52]I keep losing it.
[90:14.48]There it is.
[90:15.02]Okay.
[90:18.53]Every time I go down in quality, it resets the whole camera and resizes everything.
[90:31.59]This is 320 by... I don't know.
[90:32.87]320 by like 180 or something.
[90:44.50]It's all blown up and awful.
[90:45.89]Okay, I don't know what the hell that was.
[90:53.52]What am I looking at here?
[91:13.12]Hey, man.
[91:15.12]I can't believe you made it.
[91:16.06]13 hours, 36 minutes, and 52 seconds.
[91:21.28]God, man, I can't believe.
[91:22.61]You were here.
[91:23.73]You were here.
[91:25.09]You were.
[91:27.87]Longest stream I've ever done.
[91:33.70]Thanks for sticking around.
[91:34.50]I appreciate it, man.
[91:37.02]See you later.
[91:45.50]Did I even give it time?
[91:46.26]52 seconds stream.
[92:06.68]You can't hear that.
[92:07.88]Longest stream I've ever...
[92:11.11]Ever done!
[92:12.11]And 52 seconds.
[92:13.45]God, man, I can't believe.
[92:14.75]You were here.
[92:15.91]You were here.
[92:17.27]You were.
[92:20.01]Longest stream I've ever done.
[92:21.85]That's the beginning of the clip.
[92:23.33]Ever done!
[92:24.61]And 52 seconds.
[92:25.95]God, I gotta redo it, right?
[92:27.55]Did I redo it?
[92:29.43]Or is that funny?
[92:31.25]What do you think?
[92:34.93]Oh, 52 seconds.
[92:35.71]Man, I can't believe we made it.
[92:41.33]Oh, it didn't work.
[92:42.87]Doesn't matter.
[93:05.92]Oh, hey, oh, can't believe you're still here.
[93:08.76]Wow, 13 hours, 38 minutes, and 44 seconds.
[93:14.87]Wow, that's the longest stream I've ever done, and you were here for it.
[93:20.29]Honestly, you know what?
[93:21.15]I think that deserves a little bite of pizza.
[93:34.76]Is the game too loud?
[93:35.64]Oh shit.
[93:41.04]No, I'll do it again.
[93:44.15]Music's too loud.
[93:48.75]The music's way too loud.
[93:51.33]Okay, I'm good.
[93:55.40]It wouldn't work anyways.
[93:59.76]Take three.
[94:10.81]Oh, hey, oh, you're still here.
[94:13.65]Wow.
[94:15.45]13 hours, 39 minutes, longest stream I've ever done.
[94:19.50]And you were here for it.
[94:21.36]I'll never do anything longer than this.
[94:23.54]So you're here for it.
[94:25.50]Good work.
[94:28.34]Oh, what's that?
[94:29.62]Oh, is that some Captain Crunch?
[94:35.33]Delicious.
[94:36.03]What a reward for 13 hours and 30 and 40 minutes.
[94:46.76]Ow.
[94:48.28]13 hours, 39 minutes.
[94:49.78]Longest stream I've ever... Oh, fuck you.

[94:59.38]Up there?
[95:17.47]Where is this fucking camera?
[95:29.38]I don't, I don't know where it is.
[95:32.14]I don't, you know what?

[96:25.50]I'm doing one more.
[96:26.98]And I'm just going to say thanks.
[96:28.82]That's 13 hours and 42 minutes.

[96:34.37]Should I keep the cringe guy routine going?
[96:54.16]Oh my god.
[96:55.20]I don't know how I'm gonna be able to do this.

[100:16.39]I got it.
[100:16.61]I got it.
[100:23.25]Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[100:34.63]You made it.
[100:37.44]13 hours, 46 minutes, and 11 seconds.
[100:43.91]You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[100:53.47]See you on the next one.
[100:56.69]I hope it cut off.
[101:08.64]You made it.
[101:11.46]13 hours.
[101:13.18]Fuck.
[101:14.46]God damn it.
[101:15.50]Alright, I'm doing this one more time and that's it and I'm done.
[101:22.18]Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[101:31.71]You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[101:34.67]13 hours, 47 minutes and 7 seconds.
[101:38.36]And your prize is this stupid clip that you're going to forget about in two weeks.
[102:00.88]What the fuck?
[102:01.70]Why does he keep cutting it off?
[102:03.92]You made it to the longest stream.
[102:05.33]I gotta do it quick.
[102:07.45]What?
[102:07.61]This is annoying.
[102:08.51]It keeps cutting the beginning off.
[102:12.47]Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[102:18.22]You made it to the longest stream I've ever done, and your reward is this.
[102:27.54]13 hours, 48 minutes, 0 seconds.
[102:29.91]You win.
[102:30.21]Alright, did I get it?
[102:31.55]Why does it keep cutting it off?
[102:37.77]You made it to the longest stream.
[102:40.17]I can do it quick.
[102:41.27]What?
[102:41.43]This is annoying.
[102:42.21]It keeps cutting the beginning off.
[102:44.30]Now it's only beginning.
[102:46.30]Don't ever call the sus guy.
[103:06.99]Ah, you made it.
[103:07.63]3 a.m.
[103:11.45]Put the phone down.
[103:13.23]Don't call me.
[103:16.89]13 hours, 48 minutes and 50 seconds.
[103:19.43]Congratulations.
[103:21.45]You've made it.
[103:22.05]It's the longest stream I've ever done.
[103:26.56]Congratulations.
[103:30.00]Oh, what's that?
[103:32.18]A pizza.
[103:37.28]shit it doesn't work because it's not connected to the right mic phone down don't call me 13 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds congratulations you've made it the longest frame I've ever done phone down don't call me congratulations oh what's that a pizza
[104:13.97]there it is there it is your actual clip goodbye don't put the phone don't call me oh my god alright that's it that's the last one that's it who cares where was it 14 hours I'm staying
[104:46.03]It's 10 minutes.
[104:46.83]I don't like that 13.
[104:48.29]It's got to be 14.
[104:49.01]That's long enough for the ending stuff.
[104:57.05]No, thanks for watching.
[104:57.80]I really did not... I did not think I was going to do a 14-hour stream tonight.
[105:04.86]I thought I was going to do like a 6-hour stream and then like a 6-hour stream tomorrow and then like a 4-hour stream on Sunday.
[105:11.14]But you know, whatever.
[105:13.70]Sometimes you just, uh, sometimes you just go for it.
[105:16.68]That was fun.
[105:18.23]I feel like we did a lot of stuff.
[105:23.31]Oh, the mic is wrong.
[105:24.47]Whoops.
[105:33.75]Hey, there you are.
[105:35.57]That's better.
[105:36.27]Isn't it?
[105:37.83]Hi.
[105:38.15]Okay.
[105:38.81]Now you can hear me.
[105:39.49]Cool.
[105:42.35]You heard that too.
[105:43.11]Oops.
[105:55.98]The other mic is better.
[106:02.62]Yeah, honest to God.
[106:06.73]Complete real talk.
[106:08.71]There is no way I will do a 14 hour stream probably ever again.
[106:23.33]Don't think so.
[106:26.03]Seaman was 11 hours.
[106:28.01]Lord of the Rings PlayStation 2 games with 13.
[106:32.43]This was not a single game, so.
[106:36.83]There it is at the top of the list.
[106:38.29]It is.
[106:38.57]Oh, there it is.
[106:38.89]13.4, 13.1.
[106:38.93]What was 12?
[106:39.13]Lifeline was 12 hours.
[106:53.19]Simpsons Hit and Run was 11.8, so just about 12.
[107:01.37]Darkwood?
[107:02.67]I played Darkwood for 11 and a half hours?
[107:05.35]How?
[107:07.61]I don't think I would have ever been able to do that.
[107:10.41]Holy shit.
[107:17.27]And then what's this one that's 11.2 hours?
[107:19.32]I don't know.
[107:28.59]Oh, the thing.
[107:29.67]Right.
[107:32.39]Sometimes you're just gaming.
[107:33.31]That's right.
[107:34.05]That's true.
[107:34.31]Alright.
[107:36.16]We got seven minutes.
[107:37.04]What do you want to talk about?
[107:41.68]Just roll the credits again.
[107:51.85]Imagine not having a tier two badge.
[107:58.04]If you claim to all four of those, do you get to... By the way, that's probably the only time I'm ever going to do moments.
[108:04.99]So, if you got it, that's probably never happening again.
[108:10.31]What are my thoughts on Christmas?
[108:11.91]I like it.
[108:12.43]It's cool.
[108:16.49]I'm really surprised by the amount of people that are still here.
[108:19.11]So, thanks for staying up or waking up in the morning.
[108:27.73]It's gonna be a very long VOD to go through.
[108:38.74]Thanks for fucking my sleep up.
[108:43.12]Yeah, I mean, I'm about to go eat a little bit more food, probably take a shower or a bath or something.
[108:48.84]And probably not fall asleep till like 4.
[108:51.54]So maybe 5.
[108:53.84]I think I'm right there with you.
[108:54.88]I think we may have all collectively screwed up some sleep schedules.
[109:04.81]It's 5 a.m.
[109:05.55]right now.
[109:10.71]Thanks for fixing my sleep schedule.
[109:12.61]Oh, there we go.
[109:13.85]Not all bad.
[109:21.60]I'm about to yawn.
[109:22.72]Oh, man, there it is.
[109:27.46]You knew it was coming.
[109:35.01]You stream it again this evening?
[109:36.79]No, I don't think so.
[109:39.97]I gotta see how I get up at some point in the hopefully early afternoon-ish.
[109:47.40]I don't want to get up late, though.
[109:48.62]I've been on a really good schedule.
[109:50.22]I've been getting up normally.
[109:51.40]I've been on a very good schedule for a long, long time.
[109:55.92]I might just try to, uh, just make myself get up in the morning.
[110:08.07]I've been so good for the last couple of years.
[110:11.17]Probably, like, the last year straight.
[110:17.52]What are you going to do on Sunday or Monday?
[110:22.20]Probably Switch.
[110:25.00]I might jump into Splatoon 3.
[110:26.84]Because I was told that the campaign is actually completely different than the multiplayer game.
[110:33.20]I'll play the multiplayer too, whatever.
[110:37.16]It's going to be a coin flip between Splatoon 3 and Breath of the Wild on Sunday or Monday.
[110:45.72]What time on Sunday or Monday?
[110:49.32]Probably around the same time.
[110:51.02]Probably around 2.
[110:52.64]Pacific.
[110:57.41]If you're in the pre-stream, we'll figure it out.
[111:00.29]It's either Sunday, tomorrow, whatever.
[111:02.27]Sunday, whatever.
[111:04.38]Or Monday-ish.
[111:09.05]Are you going to play both or just one or the other?
[111:11.13]I have a feeling if I'm going to play one of those two, I'm going to play that for a majority of that stream.
[111:17.24]You don't just play Breath of the Wild for an hour and 40 minutes.
[111:21.70]That's the whole day.
[111:23.32]That's the stream, right?
[111:25.76]Unless I don't like it, which would be surprising.
[111:34.50]It's been long enough.
[111:35.64]I know everyone said don't play that after you play Elden Ring.
[111:41.98]But it's been a long time since Elden Ring came out.
[111:44.70]I think it'll be okay.
[111:48.55]I hope you don't compare it to Elden Ring.
[111:50.47]I don't think so.
[111:51.27]Okay, in two and a half minutes, it'll be 14 hours.
[112:04.83]I kind of want to see the reactions from people that just thought this was going to be a five.
[112:08.32]They probably, you know what?
[112:09.66]A lot of people that show up to check out the VOD will probably think I got addicted to one of these games and had an absolute meltdown.
[112:17.18]And just, it was just mayhem for 14 hours.
[112:28.99]You did.
[112:29.67]You did get addicted.
[112:31.23]Oh, that's what happened.
[112:34.48]Yeah, but that oil game was effectively one five-hour block of this.
[112:43.58]It wasn't the whole thing.
[112:44.57]I didn't take 14 hours to beat that oil game.
[112:51.81]Hey, you know, that oil game is the reason why I did this 14-hour stream.
[113:03.41]Because I knew for a fact if I were to put it down, I would not have gone back to it.
[113:09.73]I just wouldn't have, even though I loved it.
[113:12.20]Other things would have just gotten priority for stream.
[113:18.24]That was the only opportunity to play it and beat it.
[113:20.20]Unless I did it off stream.
[113:25.00]Alright, let's get the, let's roll the end here.
[113:27.71]Thanks everybody.
[113:29.73]I'll see you guys in a day or two.
[113:33.26]I am going to go, uh, do some stretches and go lie down.
[113:39.52]Have a great night, everybody.
[113:40.54]Thanks for sticking around.
[113:41.34]Hopefully you had a good time.
[113:43.57]I definitely have to end it, like, at 14.00.
[113:49.17]I don't really care about the seconds, but that's a clean 14, right?
[113:55.07]14 hours.
[113:57.91]But that's in 30 seconds.
[114:00.62]Good night, guys.
[114:01.72]See you soon.
[114:02.16]Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow and Sunday.
[114:04.84]I'm sure I'll update you a little bit.
[114:09.37]Good night.
[114:10.09]Goodbye.
[114:10.39]Take care of yourselves.
[114:12.37]And get some sleep if you stayed up.
[114:13.71]Or good morning.
[114:14.73]Hope you have a good rest of your Saturday.
[114:16.48]See you later.
