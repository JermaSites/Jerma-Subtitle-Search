[00:00.03]New Mr. Beast video.
[00:01.77]I am live.
[00:04.52]I am live.
[00:06.66]Are you guys all live?
[00:08.58]Yeah.
[00:09.67]Yeah, I'm live.
[00:10.31]I'm live.
[00:10.57]I'm live.
[00:11.29]We were waiting for you to say something bad.
[00:13.07]Apparently not for long.
[00:15.92]You're going to be taken off the air immediately.
[00:18.74]I'm going to be on the air.
[00:21.20]Dying on stream is against the terms of service.
[00:22.87]You're not supposed to do that.
[00:24.51]Alright.
[00:25.83]Who are we missing?
[00:27.31]We got everybody here?
[00:30.22]I don't know.
[00:30.68]You're organizing.
[00:32.14]I think we're missing Snuffy and Lime.
[00:35.55]Are they here?
[00:36.13]Am I late?
[00:37.31]Lime, I saw, was live already.
[00:39.16]I just got here.
[00:42.10]Am I late?
[00:42.34]I think she was playing House Flipper.
[00:44.50]That's actually so funny.
[00:46.71]Welcome, everybody.
[00:49.25]I hope you had a good restful two and a half weeks since the last time we saw each other.
[00:55.15]I hope you did.
[00:55.89]I hope you thought of a lot of strategies, a lot of things you could be doing in the second round.
[01:01.59]No.
[01:02.61]Let's go ahead and remind people.
[01:03.95]Well, hold on.
[01:04.82]Let's say, hey, these events go long.
[01:08.32]Let's wait a little.
[01:09.66]Let's let people trickle in, don't you think?
[01:12.50]Hell yeah.
[01:15.83]You really went for the Best Buy outfit again?
[01:20.09]Continuity.
[01:20.99]Continuity.
[01:21.91]It's continuity.
[01:24.54]You did not wash that thing.
[01:26.26]I know that thing smells like a nine-hour stream right now.
[01:29.63]This was supposed to be one day.
[01:31.57]So this is for the continuity for the YouTube video.
[01:35.36]And the people appreciate that.
[01:36.78]Yeah, continuity.
[01:38.69]This thing has gone through the wash.
[01:39.83]It's clean.
[01:40.71]So the shirt will have continuity, but half the people competing are different.
[01:46.65]Don't think too hard about it, okay?
[01:48.76]No, you guys won.
[01:49.96]You guys all moved on.
[01:51.11]You guys are all winners.
[01:52.96]He can only control himself, Doug.
[01:55.83]He was sponsored to wear that shirt for the House Flipper Invitational.
[01:59.97]Hey, RT, thank you so much for that transition there.
[02:03.06]I want to say thank you to House Flipper for sponsoring this event.
[02:07.68]I also want to say something else, too.
[02:10.16]I didn't get a chance to say this in the first round, but there is a prize.
[02:18.29]Oh.
[02:18.99]What?
[02:19.29]Just actually.
[02:20.25]There is a prize.
[02:21.73]And I'm gonna... Let's just get it out of the way because I feel like... Let's just say what it is.
[02:26.78]Because I wanted to announce it at the end of the last stream, but, like, who gives a shit?
[02:30.06]Let's just do it right now.
[02:31.96]The prize for this event is not just for one of you.
[02:38.61]All 24 of you that participated in this event are going to get a small, miniature version
[02:48.80]of one of the houses you built.
[02:50.92]A little fucking miniature.
[02:54.60]What?
[02:55.44]A tiny subway?
[02:56.80]What the fuck am I going to do with that?
[02:58.47]And it's probably going to be the original house you first built in round one.
[03:03.51]So whether you've made a fucking subway or a toilet museum, you're going to get as close to I can get a small one-to-one miniature.
[03:12.49]That means some of the houses are going to be like... One of them was just a plane, wasn't it?
[03:16.19]One of them was Object Q. Mine's just a plane.
[03:18.73]That's cool.
[03:20.02]It's a small plane.
[03:21.98]Mine better come with all the stop signs.
[03:24.37]Yeah, true.
[03:25.71]Yeah, there are a few houses that are going to need to have a little bit of changes, but... Mine's the only one that can be bought for a dollar in Walmart.
[03:32.98]Like, mine's going to be... Jeremy, are you going to be able to print, like, Elmo's crack den?
[03:37.12]Like, is that... Is that not going to cause issues?
[03:40.11]Hey, I'm telling you right now, when you get this, you're going to be like, whoa, actually, this is not what I... This is... Whoa.
[03:46.33]I'm just saying, you're going to get a whoa.
[03:48.11]It's going to be really tiny, huh?
[03:49.98]Like in a bottle.
[03:51.10]I'm imagining you could hold it like this.
[03:53.92]Do you see what I mean?
[03:54.80]Oh, that's big.
[03:56.14]It's going to be like this.
[03:57.98]And I want it to be as close to what you made as possible.
[04:03.01]Sorry, what did I come back to?
[04:04.17]I was deaf.
[04:05.49]You are getting a house.
[04:10.24]Everybody's getting a house shrunken down.
[04:13.00]Very small miniature version of the house you made in round one.
[04:17.71]What?
[04:18.33]Yes.
[04:19.92]Like a little 3D printed full house.
[04:22.63]Yes.
[04:23.93]Oh my god.
[04:25.27]Custom built.
[04:27.81]That's adorable for ants.
[04:29.46]How small?
[04:30.42]What are we talking about?
[04:31.32]We're talking like this big.
[04:32.80]Like you could like hold it.
[04:35.99]Can you hold your hands up just a little bit higher so I can Photoshop you holding a sandwich?
[04:40.16]No, oh, and by the way, this guy's asking me for personal videos.
[04:47.28]Like, hey, can you send me a personal video of you doing something?
[04:51.41]I'm not giving any personal videos.
[04:53.63]No, that's against the HOA policy, which, by the way, I am still the president of.
[04:58.19]And if you thought I was going to be strict in round one, then holy shit, you better see what's going to happen in round two.
[05:05.82]What, we could impeach you?
[05:07.90]Hold on just a second.
[05:09.02]That phone doesn't usually ring.
[05:13.03]Hello, Jeremy Elbertson, HOA president and CEO.
[05:16.35]Who's speaking, please?
[05:21.52]Right.
[05:25.12]Okay.
[05:26.69]And that's effective immediately?
[05:30.07]Immediately as in, like, right now?
[05:37.18]Gross incompetent use of funds.
[05:40.72]Well, that's... You know, I'm in the middle of something here, right?
[05:46.17]I've been the strictest, best CEO in the world.
[05:49.28]Do you understand that?
[05:53.88]What?
[05:54.36]Yeah, sorry, I can't control what people are gonna do with their houses.
[05:56.48]You know what?
[05:57.79]Fuck you, shove it up your ass.
[06:00.27]Holy.
[06:05.80]You know what?
[06:06.46]Is this live?
[06:07.82]Okay, uh, we have a little bit of an issue here.
[06:10.55]I just want to say.
[06:11.41]He's unbuttoning.
[06:12.99]Uh, fuck the HOA.
[06:14.56]Right?
[06:15.16]Who even cares about HOAs?
[06:16.72]Do you guys even- Yeah, HOAs are like annoying, they're strict.
[06:21.81]Yeah.
[06:22.15]They're boring.
[06:23.04]Yeah!
[06:23.42]People that run HOAs are usually pretty boring.
[06:26.17]Yeah.
[06:26.77]No, you're not boring, though.
[06:27.63]You're like you're kind of like you're a casual, chill guy.
[06:30.17]Yeah.
[06:30.69]Yeah.
[06:31.82]Right.
[06:32.24]I'll tell you something.
[06:35.30]You know, I had a whole thing for round two.
[06:36.72]I wanted to have like your garbage and recycling in exact locations in this round.
[06:42.55]I also was not going to allow custom content in this round either.
[06:45.66]But fuck all that.
[06:47.28]In round two.
[06:48.24]And, you know, let's mess the whole thing up.
[06:50.90]Those of you that have moved on from round two, congratulations.
[06:54.09]I'm changing the whole thing up.
[06:56.09]Here is what it looked like after round one.
[07:03.96]Wait, what?
[07:05.07]That is the round one infographic.
[07:08.57]Wait, I was with Poke?
[07:10.93]Yo.
[07:12.82]Anyways, in round two, because we don't care about the HOA anymore, fuck the HOA.
[07:19.74]I have decided that not only are you going to be competing with your teammates, you're also going to be competing with other people in the same house.
[07:31.32]Ladies and gentlemen, I would like RT, Limelicious, and Kryken to please raise your hands.
[07:38.79]Whoa.
[07:39.55]Yes, sir.
[07:40.58]Hello.
[07:41.22]Oh, we're moving.
[07:41.92]Hello.
[07:42.24]You are team one.
[07:45.82]Oh, boy.
[07:46.78]You're splitting me up.
[07:47.84]I'm splitting them up.
[07:49.08]I'm sorry.
[07:49.66]I'm sorry.
[07:50.18]You're too powerful.
[07:51.64]You're too powerful.
[07:52.66]Lime, I'm so sorry.
[07:53.39]You have to work on this.
[07:54.51]The power of God and anime have been split.
[07:57.69]DougDoug, Stans, and Nandre.
[08:00.57]Oh, no.
[08:01.21]You are team two.
[08:02.76]I can't believe you did this on Pride Month.
[08:04.26]What the fuck?
[08:07.22]Not a good look.
[08:08.16]Not a good look.
[08:09.24]Not a good look, Dermot.
[08:10.16]And then Ster, Snuffy, and Poke, you guys are team three.
[08:13.91]Easy win.
[08:15.01]Wait.
[08:16.04]Was that what poked last time?
[08:17.74]Yes.
[08:18.96]Dude, remember me?
[08:20.16]Yo.
[08:20.99]And also, hold on.
[08:24.07]Don't fucking call this number again.
[08:27.67]Also, what's going to end up happening this time, because we don't care about the HOA and we're done with all that.
[08:33.84]This round, I would like for you in your teams.
[08:43.92]So we need a host.
[08:46.99]Find who the host will be among you right now.
[08:49.83]It's very important.
[08:51.87]That host is going to be responsible for a couple of very important things.
[08:56.32]Number one, that host is going to be able to post custom content.
[09:01.88]Only the host can do this.
[09:03.60]If you are not the host and you put Spider-Man up on the wall, you're not going to be able to see it.
[09:10.75]Only the host will be able to post and see images.
[09:14.66]If you don't care about custom content, don't worry about it.
[09:17.99]You'll make it work because there's a theme on this round.
[09:21.17]The theme on this round is going to be very, very interesting.
[09:23.83]And I'm not going to give you much besides a small prompt.
[09:28.12]I want you to make the ultimate haunted manor.
[09:36.67]Oh, shit.
[09:39.11]It's June.
[09:41.22]June.
[09:42.42]Spooky June.
[09:43.31]I love Halloween, okay?
[09:44.25]It's like my favorite holiday.
[09:45.89]It's June.
[09:47.93]Dude, I'm a huge fan of Halloween.
[09:49.51]I think Halloween should be twice a year, not once.
[09:52.15]Absolutely.
[09:53.96]Why not four?
[09:55.20]It could be.
[09:55.70]Me with Labor Day, man.
[09:57.08]I love Labor Day.
[10:00.20]So, you have to make the ultimate haunted manor.
[10:03.42]Custom content is allowed.
[10:05.87]You are going to have 75 minutes.
[10:09.24]One hour and 15 minutes to make this.
[10:13.58]Can we get some grace period where we all learn how to use the custom content?
[10:18.49]Yes.
[10:19.89]I don't think any of us know it.
[10:22.05]So, here's the deal.
[10:23.93]If you want something, let's say, Polk, you're the host.
[10:27.33]And let's say, Snuffy, you're like, we should do this, but obviously I want you to work together.
[10:31.84]The whole point is this is a team activity.
[10:34.53]As you work together, Snuffy, if you want something, you need to, in your text channels, each one of these voice channels has a text channel, funnel it through to Poke.
[10:44.02]Poke, you're the one that has to put everything up.
[10:47.13]After the round is over,
[10:49.55]poke let's say you're the host again you are going to save the game and make sure you know I'm going to we're going to go through this too but when you're going to be naming it you know like your team house but I need that file just like we did last year so poke you will save the house and then you will go into your house folder which there's instructions on where that is and you're going to send me this house you're making the raw house file then I will be able to see all the custom content like last time
[11:20.99]Okay.
[11:22.61]Cool.
[11:22.73]Also, be careful of showing your screens during when you click host because it shows your lobby code.
[11:27.38]You know, that deal.
[11:30.11]And that's kind of, uh, that's kind of it.
[11:36.48]I would like for all of you to, you obviously have these channels now.
[11:39.92]I would love for you to get into those channels.
[11:42.57]And when you're in there, we will, yeah, I'll give you some time.
[11:44.97]We'll give you a little bit of a minute, a few minutes to get ready.
[11:47.31]I, I will say that there's a lot less people this time, so it'd be easier to tell everybody when we're going.
[11:53.72]But yeah, I just, I'd hope nobody heard me just burp into my mouth, but I did.
[11:57.27]We did.
[11:57.71]Don't worry.
[11:59.45]I liked it.
[12:01.07]What the fuck?
[12:03.43]Alright.
[12:04.09]Have a good time.
[12:04.91]You have an hour and 15 minutes.
[12:06.21]I'm not going to start the clock until people get situated.
[12:08.58]And when everyone's ready, then we will go.
[12:10.90]So again.
[12:11.38]Wait.
[12:12.02]Can I get the Scooby-Doo DLC?
[12:13.58]Can I get the Scooby-Doo DLC or no?
[12:14.97]That doesn't come.
[12:15.61]Oh, my God.
[12:16.23]That doesn't come out until actual Halloween.
[12:18.73]We get early access.
[12:19.95]Can you invest in them?
[12:21.72]I would help this so much.
[12:23.64]Alright.
[12:24.16]Here is the deal.
[12:25.97]I'm going to give you free reign to whatever you, however you feel about the word ultimate haunted manor.
[12:32.12]What does that mean?
[12:34.40]What?
[12:34.82]Who laughed?
[12:35.35]You said it like ultimate frisbee.
[12:37.27]I don't know.
[12:37.75]I just want you to make the ultimate haunted house haunted manor.
[12:41.87]And okay, here you go.
[12:42.98]Those of you that are hosts, I would like for you, the host, go to your sandbox.
[12:49.04]I would like for you to create a game.
[12:51.89]Do this right now.
[12:53.70]Oh, yes, sir.
[12:54.46]Okay.
[12:55.04]Okay.
[12:56.06]Hold on.
[12:56.90]Find out who the hosts are.
[12:58.59]Co-op host, right?
[13:00.71]Yes, but you're going to make a sandbox map.
[13:04.65]Okay.
[13:07.30]Brecken, do you want to host again?
[13:09.14]Yeah, I can host.
[13:10.42]Thank you.
[13:11.04]You will be creating... I'm making it.
[13:13.10]You'll be making... Sandbox mode, right?
[13:14.74]In sandbox mode.
[13:16.07]Make sure you're doing edit.
[13:18.27]You are going to make a new property.
[13:21.39]And make sure you name this place...
[13:23.72]Like, poke house, or whatever your house is.
[13:28.55]He gets all the credit?
[13:29.97]I named it Pokester Snuffy.
[13:31.93]Good.
[13:33.31]PSS.
[13:35.04]You are then going to make sure you pick the largest lot, which is the biggest lot size, and you're going to do this on the forest.
[13:42.24]The forest is the biggest lot in the whole game, and it's massive.
[13:46.23]By the way, there's places to explore the whole space.
[13:50.27]It's massive.
[13:50.80]Do we have to pick the forest?
[13:52.02]Like, what if we want to do a...
[13:53.93]The forest is, I believe, the biggest boundaries in the whole game.
[13:58.99]And I would like you to have as much room as you'd like.
[14:02.22]Okay, can you give all those instructions again?
[14:04.50]My game was opening.
[14:05.96]Absolutely.
[14:07.58]If you're the host, you're going to go to sandbox.
[14:11.25]You're going to make a new property.
[14:15.03]New property.
[14:17.07]You are going to go to the biggest map size possible.
[14:21.70]And you're going to pick forest.
[14:23.68]Okay.
[14:25.64]I did it.
[14:26.76]Also, when you get in there, the host, whoever this is, make sure you go hit tab, go to your property settings, and make it so there's no time flow, and make it a house.
[14:39.25]You can set the time whatever you want.
[14:40.97]Remember, this is your, whatever you guys want, haunted manor, the ultimate haunted manor.
[14:44.62]Is this a daytime haunted manor?
[14:46.80]Is this a nighttime haunted?
[14:47.76]I'm going to leave that up to you.
[14:49.26]Turn time flow off.
[14:50.14]It's in tab, property settings at the top.
[14:52.80]Okay.
[14:53.52]And turn the time flow off and set time whatever you want.
[14:58.35]And it's edit, not play.
[14:59.52]That's correct.
[15:00.88]Okay.
[15:04.66]How does everybody feel?
[15:07.77]Ready, boss.
[15:08.17]I feel great.
[15:08.91]Everybody feel good?
[15:09.49]I'm ready.
[15:11.02]I feel really good.
[15:12.68]And remember, only the host can do it.
[15:16.55]Only the host can post custom images.
[15:19.25]And that host has to save the game at the end of the timer and send me their house file.
[15:23.88]Let's hope this works.
[15:25.26]Because if it don't, well, that stinks.
[15:27.54]But it's been tested a couple times and it has seemed to have worked.
[15:31.83]We can improvise if it doesn't for some reason.
[15:38.10]Fascinating.
[15:39.68]If everybody is ready, I'd like for you to go into a room with the three of you.
[15:46.13]Head over there.
[15:46.83]Get ready.
[15:47.85]I will be around again for any questions.
[15:49.11]If anybody has any build questions, for sure.
[15:51.56]Like, how do I change my roof color?
[15:53.60]Whatever.
[15:53.86]That's fine.
[15:57.08]Okay.
[15:57.68]Can we ask you, like, hey, do you think you would let us win if we did this?
[16:03.10]I'm sorry, that's not allowed from... Well, actually, I'm not even... I'm for HOA.
[16:08.29]That's stupid.
[16:09.09]Yeah, there's no rules anymore.
[16:12.72]Hold on, hold on.
[16:13.58]There are rules.
[16:14.30]There are rules.
[16:15.00]Just a Tim talk.
[16:17.27]You have to follow at least... I don't know.
[16:22.02]You guys get it, alright?
[16:23.14]You know what to do.
[16:23.80]Why are you yelling at us?
[16:26.60]We're in trouble.
[16:28.60]Where's my team?
[16:31.61]You're not embodying the Halloween spirit.
[16:33.63]Where's my team?
[16:34.39]Can we go work?
[16:35.13]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[16:36.75]Happy Halloween.
[16:38.41]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[16:43.30]Oh.
[16:44.48]Go do what you want to do.
[16:45.92]I'm going to give them some time to plan.
[16:48.25]They're going to get a little bit of time.
[16:50.19]Yeah.
[16:53.65]It's a good idea.
[16:55.37]Okay, now I can do this.
[17:01.85]I've waited two weeks to do the fucking telephone routine.
[17:08.14]Do you know how long?
[17:09.24]I've waited two... This has been sitting there for two and a half weeks.
[17:21.74]I can crop it out of the camera now.
[17:28.69]I also was going to have a t-shirt underneath that said, fuck the HOA, and I was going to rip it off, but I wasn't confident I could rip it off.
[17:43.81]There was a confidence issue, for sure.
[17:45.96]Also, I am having monstrous PC problems.
[17:51.94]Can I just tell you?
[17:53.48]So I had some like audio issues earlier.
[17:57.07]I had a USB.
[17:58.01]My USBs are all fucked up.
[18:00.62]My PC is getting fried.
[18:03.47]So I'm going to just bear with me.
[18:06.33]If there is like any audio problems later, I'm going to try to get through them.
[18:09.96]But.
[18:11.91]It's time.
[18:13.49]Yeah, I've got some issues to work through.
[18:17.06]But it seems like the audio was okay there.
[18:19.48]I think when I'm like in a game, there's like audio problems.
[18:23.37]So we'll see how it goes.
[18:26.59]Why are you so red?
[18:28.90]Because it's 81 degrees in this room.
[18:32.76]And it's like 100 something degrees outside.
[18:35.98]I got my coffee.
[18:36.77]I'm alright.
[18:39.67]Alright.
[18:40.05]How's everybody doing?
[18:40.57]Everybody ready?
[18:41.80]I'm gonna give him, like, a few more minutes to figure it out.
[18:52.36]You look fictional.
[18:54.22]I'm real.
[18:55.79]Get over it.
[18:57.43]Okay.
[19:00.00]Uh, let me open...
[19:04.04]Let me open the game and just kind of fly around.
[19:07.30]Yeah, for some reason, when I have a game open, sometimes the audio gets like crackly.
[19:11.41]You guys can, we'll do some testing to make sure this works.
[19:15.61]During some of the, during the tours, I might get crackling audio.
[19:19.28]I hope not, but we'll see.
[19:21.58]If it is like a huge problem, I can just like open somebody's stream.
[19:26.80]You know what I mean?
[19:27.60]Like, it'll be alright.
[19:28.71]We'll improvise.
[19:34.31]Yeah, I'm excited.
[19:36.22]When you hear the word haunted manor, are people going to make something that they think is scary?
[19:45.01]Or are people going to make something that they think is, are you going to make like a haunted house?
[19:51.84]You know what I mean?
[19:52.44]That's what I'm thinking.
[19:54.06]What do they actually do?
[19:58.45]You look ragged today.
[19:59.55]I left the HOA.
[20:05.48]Ah yeah, timer will be on screen.
[20:25.27]Okay, do you guys hear crackling audio?
[20:35.32]No, no, no.
[20:38.96]Let me see.
[20:49.69]Not from me.
[20:51.24]Because you shouldn't be hearing it from me.
[20:55.48]Hopefully, it's just local for me.
[20:56.66]But it didn't sound like it was, though.
[20:57.72]When I was in a Discord call with people, it sounded like I could hear them crackling.
[21:02.05]Alright.
[21:03.38]I'll make sure they get that right.
[21:05.46]Property settings, house, time flow off.
[21:08.32]Oh, you guys can't see what's going on.
[21:09.64]Hold on.
[21:18.53]There we go.
[21:19.94]Okay.
[21:20.58]Is everybody ready?
[21:24.98]They can put whatever time they want.
[21:26.60]You can do 12 p.m.
[21:27.58]You could do...
[21:29.26]10 p.m.
[21:30.05]You could do late, but the forest is the biggest.
[21:32.73]Everybody ready?
[21:34.89]How we doing?
[21:35.37]We good?
[21:47.37]Yeah, you shouldn't be hearing it right now.
[21:53.40]I'll check in with it.
[21:54.00]It's only three rooms to jump into.
[21:55.22]I'll just check, make sure everyone's good.
[22:01.39]Hey, how you doing?
[22:03.02]How are you guys doing?
[22:03.80]Are you guys good?
[22:04.58]Ready to go?
[22:05.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:06.36]We're just talking over.
[22:07.12]We're just trying to figure out exactly.
[22:08.48]We really want to fuck you up mentally with this one.
[22:11.52]Okay.
[22:13.53]Sounds great.
[22:14.45]I'm looking forward to it.
[22:15.85]Alright.
[22:16.89]Your chat's probably going to spam you when the timer's gone.
[22:18.61]See you in a minute.
[22:19.55]Okay.
[22:20.09]Real quick, Jerma.
[22:21.15]Yeah.
[22:22.37]What's one of your biggest fears?
[22:27.96]Disappointing the people I love.
[22:30.28]Oh.
[22:31.26]or cockroaches or cockroaches or cockroaches or cockroaches of course alright I'll see you guys okay hello hello hi hello I am screaming I don't want to hear any spoilers spoilers you guys good are you guys ready to go we we are not good we don't know how to do that how do you put a picture alright you have to go you have to pick pics you have to it's a picture frame it's a frame
[22:56.27]So I put an empty picture frame up.
[22:57.85]And you have to... There's like a... You go to your settings.
[23:01.90]And it's in... I believe... Let me see.
[23:04.34]I need to put a wall up.
[23:06.82]It's one of the things you do in the... Let's go to store frame.
[23:14.01]He doesn't know.
[23:14.63]The guru of all the knowledge doesn't know how to do it.
[23:19.92]Alright.
[23:20.60]Okay.
[23:20.96]So here you go.
[23:22.42]Custom picture frame.
[23:24.29]It actually says custom picture frame on it.
[23:27.29]Yeah, but how do you get to that?
[23:29.07]You go to store.
[23:31.35]And then in store, you go frame and then custom picture.
[23:34.42]It's right there.
[23:34.94]You click it.
[23:35.82]Oh, I see you left click on it.
[23:36.96]Okay.
[23:37.48]Couldn't you before do that with like paint?
[23:42.47]I don't.
[23:43.53]I think it's always been like a picture.
[23:46.40]Yeah, you might be right.
[23:47.40]But I know that people.
[23:49.42]I don't know.
[23:49.74]People did it without frames before.
[23:52.57]Maybe you could paint.
[23:53.79]I don't know.
[23:54.07]Wait, can you see these photos, sir?
[23:57.24]No, nobody will be able to see it besides the host, which is very important.
[24:02.39]Because of how multiplayer, real-time multiplayer works, only the host will be able to see it, and only the host can save it.
[24:08.94]So then you save it, you give it to me so I can see it.
[24:13.13]So you don't see the story, do you see a blank picture?
[24:15.27]Yeah, they will see a blank picture.
[24:16.99]It's just white.
[24:17.91]You're going to have to either screen share to each other or something, or just kind of say that's what it is, or here's the picture in your chat rooms, you know, whatever.
[24:23.60]Alright, I got to pop over?
[24:25.46]We're going to get started in a second here.
[24:26.66]What if they have the same image?
[24:28.40]We've tested this.
[24:29.88]Unfortunately, yeah, we've tested it.
[24:33.63]It's been tested a lot of different ways.
[24:35.45]It is impossible unless the host is the only one that can do it.
[24:38.75]I'll see you in a minute.
[24:39.61]I don't want to hear anything.
[24:42.70]Don't want to hear anything.
[24:43.32]Hello.
[24:43.58]Hello.
[24:43.82]How are you?
[24:44.60]You guys good?
[24:45.20]You guys ready?
[24:45.68]Any initial questions?
[24:47.50]Craig is actually AFK right now, so we might need a moment.
[24:51.14]Okay.
[24:52.17]Yeah, Craig, you needed a minute.
[24:55.87]Alright, we're going to get started here in a second.
[24:59.07]Criken, come back.
[25:00.61]Oh, Criken, please come back.
[25:02.19]Alright, here we go.
[25:03.26]Wait, oh, is he AFK?
[25:04.46]Yeah, he's straight up AFK.
[25:06.84]No, he's not here.
[25:08.72]He needed a second before starting.
[25:11.45]I think he's taking a piss.
[25:13.55]Well, then we can wait.
[25:15.65]Thank you.
[25:16.73]We appreciate you.
[25:17.41]Thank you very much.
[25:19.22]We can chill for a second until he's back.
[25:22.16]It's all good.
[25:23.52]We're just talking horror books.
[25:25.24]Horror books.
[25:27.19]Yeah, I've been reading the original Ring book.
[25:31.94]Ooh.
[25:33.22]Yeah, it's weird, but good.
[25:36.88]It's very different from the movies.
[25:39.75]I was reading some of, like, H.P.
[25:41.11]Lovecraft's actual short stories and that, because I always wanted to, because you always hear him referencing so many things.
[25:46.44]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[25:47.98]Just, like, all just the abominations and nightmares, basically.
[25:51.37]Yeah.
[25:51.71]Yeah.
[25:52.92]I like horror books because it's interesting to see if someone can actually make something scary when all you're doing is reading it.
[25:58.15]And if they manage, that's cool.
[26:01.79]That's a thing, yeah.
[26:02.99]I think it takes a lot to really incite someone with actual text on paper.
[26:07.42]Horror books, to me, when I see a horror... I've never really read a horror book before.
[26:13.41]When you're reading it, does it say and then the monster jumped out in front of your face?
[26:18.55]How does it work?
[26:19.73]Can you get jump scared from a book?
[26:21.52]No, so depending on what the subject matter is, it's often, I think Lovecraft does this as well, where it's more describing the state of the character or the character's feelings and reactions rather than just being like, spooky monster, go woo!
[26:35.22]It's kind of more like, you know.
[26:37.86]Yeah, it's unsettling vibes.
[26:40.82]Yeah, it kind of talks about the vibes of the character and things like that instead of actually like, you should feel this way because, oh my God, the monster.
[26:49.27]Interesting.
[26:49.97]That's cool.
[26:51.24]Yeah, yeah, no, it's good.
[26:52.56]I wouldn't recommend Ring as your first one because it's like translated from Japanese.
[26:56.59]Some of the prose is really weird.
[26:58.59]Oh, so yeah, I can imagine seeing the little stump stuff is still kind of lost.
[27:03.26]Yeah, yeah.
[27:04.58]Sometimes it's just odd.
[27:06.49]I would recommend though, it's Junji Ito, isn't it?
[27:09.91]His horror manga is actually really good.
[27:13.23]Yeah, Junji Ito.
[27:14.87]Yeah, his manga is really good.
[27:16.83]Yeah, Junji Ito.
[27:19.36]Yeah, he writes things like Uzumaki and the mystery... They did a... Didn't Adult Swim do a whole thing on that?
[27:28.59]It was like the spiral, right?
[27:30.97]And it kind of fell apart halfway through.
[27:32.35]They did an absolutely beautiful animation where the first episode was gorgeous and then it fell off horribly from there, I think.
[27:39.52]Yeah.
[27:39.60]they used all the budget on the first episode and had nothing left that's and it's so sad that's so sad it really is yeah the first episode is sublime and then after that it's like oh no god beautiful what happened well it's really sad you know what the craziest um ito thing I've ever read was the one where the people have the certain holes in the wall that they think are made for them this hole was made for me yeah I love that one it's up
[28:09.46]And yeah, I remember reading that whole thing, and I left that, that left a lasting impact on me.
[28:14.12]For like a month.
[28:16.99]Yeah, no, I think that's one of my favorite.
[28:18.55]The other one that he does that really creeped me out was one called Gyo, and it's about like fish that end up attached to these weird metal contraptions that lets them walk around on the...
[28:30.55]on the ground, but, like, it's powered by their own, like, rotting gases, so they absolutely reek, and it's, like, got all these very weird, like, yeah, all the sounds associated with it are really gross.
[28:42.63]It's just very visceral.
[28:43.87]I just realized I'm just in here talking, like, oh, yeah, all the horror stuff.
[28:49.82]I haven't started the event.
[28:51.68]Is Criken... Are we good?
[28:53.42]I don't know what's happening with Criken.
[28:55.55]He said, I'll be right back, and it's been, like...
[28:58.41]Has it been an extended period?
[29:00.51]Okay.
[29:01.13]We might have to get started.
[29:02.07]You guys might have to fill them in.
[29:04.15]Yeah, that's okay.
[29:05.68]That's okay.
[29:06.50]We can just blame him if we lose.
[29:07.72]It's all his fault.
[29:08.36]Alright.
[29:09.28]Here we go.
[29:09.70]I'm going to say it.
[29:13.02]Okay.
[29:13.40]I'll see you guys in an hour and 15 minutes.
[29:14.92]Good luck.
[29:15.50]Have fun.
[29:17.29]Bye.
[29:17.65]Thanks, Trevor.
[29:19.65]The timer begins... Now.
[29:26.23]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[29:30.25]I wish I used to do that in everybody's call.
[29:33.22]Dude, it's just time to start it.
[29:39.60]Just freaking the fuck out.
[29:41.69]Alright, you got 75 minutes.
[29:42.49]Yeah, the audio.
[29:44.16]My computer is like fucked.
[29:48.06]I'm working on it.
[29:50.46]Remember I told you some of those things where my mouse was disconnecting for a while?
[29:55.45]Something is not right.
[29:57.53]And it's not good.
[30:00.09]I've been trying so hard to get this fixed for like... But it's alright.
[30:05.28]It is what it is.
[30:10.04]Okay, anyways.
[30:12.02]Is your PC haunted?
[30:16.69]Yeah, I think something is wrong with my motherboard's USB slots.
[30:22.42]They're all, like, fried.
[30:24.82]I don't understand.
[30:25.82]I don't understand what's going on.
[30:28.67]But all of my shit is plugged in through USB, effectively.
[30:32.69]So.
[30:35.93]You didn't tell anyone you started the timer?
[30:37.28]Yeah, I did.
[30:39.08]I'll do it right now.
[30:41.24]Yeah, they know.
[30:41.68]They know.
[30:42.28]Everybody knows.
[30:44.22]You have any recent power surges?
[30:45.62]Maybe.
[30:47.34]Maybe that's what did it.
[30:49.18]But I'm plugged into a surge protector.
[30:52.40]Really shouldn't be happening.
[30:53.14]But when I was just talking to that team in there, was it like really bad?
[30:57.93]Was it like, this is un-fucking-bearable?
[30:59.31]Or was it like, fine?
[31:07.00]It's not bad.
[31:08.42]It's fine.
[31:09.48]It was fine.
[31:10.04]Literally fine.
[31:10.88]Okay.
[31:11.00]Okay.
[31:13.33]Am I crackling right now?
[31:14.85]I shouldn't be.
[31:20.86]I am?
[31:21.34]Let me listen to see what it sounds like.
[31:25.00]Because I... Yeah, I am.
[31:26.91]That is... It's only when I'm in a game.
[31:30.39]Which is fucking crazy.
[31:32.58]Because, Freddy, watch this.
[31:34.54]If I just leave, if I just exit this game, it won't happen anymore.
[31:39.53]It's so strange.
[31:44.09]Like, I'm gonna just exit the game, and you'll see it won't happen anymore.
[31:51.88]Check it out.
[31:52.82]So, I'm out of a game, and it's gone completely.
[31:58.17]Try capping your FPS to 60.
[32:00.67]Yeah, see?
[32:01.37]That's weird.
[32:02.86]I don't know why.
[32:03.34]What's going on with this?
[32:04.22]It's like my PSU is, like, fucking fried.
[32:08.70]Driver.
[32:09.08]Yeah, I updated my chipset drivers.
[32:10.93]I updated my graphics drivers.
[32:14.82]Turn up the buffer size on your audio interface.
[32:17.12]I don't even know how to do that.
[32:22.54]This is great that I have an hour and 12 minutes to figure this out while they all panic to make a house.
[32:31.97]Okay.
[32:34.80]Input and output buffer.
[32:36.64]Large.
[32:38.86]Should I do that?
[32:42.32]Let's try that.
[32:45.11]This might restart.
[32:47.91]Let me make sure this doesn't restart the stream.
[32:49.83]If I do, I'll be right back.
[32:57.28]Hello?
[32:58.22]I think we're good.
[32:59.71]Okay.
[33:00.13]I did large.
[33:01.09]I have large buffer size now.
[33:03.93]What does that do?
[33:08.60]Now let me open a game.
[33:12.38]Yeah, this wasn't a problem four days ago.
[33:15.10]It's weird.
[33:17.36]Okay, you shouldn't hear anything crackling or anything.
[33:20.83]Let's open up House Flipper.
[33:27.68]Let's see if it does it again.
[33:31.32]You need to have a wizard come and fix it.
[33:34.57]Now I can hear it again.
[33:35.51]See?
[33:36.11]I can hear the crackling already.
[33:38.87]I just opened up a game.
[33:50.21]It's a choice to fix your computer after starting stream.
[33:53.62]It's the only computer I have right now, man.
[33:56.36]This is my computer.
[33:57.97]Really quick question because nobody in my chat knows what to do.
[34:02.40]You know how you can lock it so you're facing a direction and then you can't turn anymore?
[34:06.80]Do you remember how to stop doing that?
[34:09.74]you locked oh okay so if you go to your the move tool there's a there's some it's called fishing rod fishing rod is like you can pick stuff up and freeze it and you can move it around with the fishing rod I think you can just pick it up that way um I meant like my character I can't your character can't move I'm stuck facing the corner
[34:38.15]um how maybe you should just rejoin are you the host yeah okay let me see oh I fixed it oh you got it okay yeah that's I'm sorry that's a question I did not know yeah no it's only like the most important thing whatever dude see you later alright am I am I crackling is it still crackling how bad is it
[35:05.32]Let me test.
[35:05.76]Hello.
[35:06.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[35:08.19]Is it still going right now?
[35:11.27]Worse than before?
[35:11.99]Worse than ever?
[35:14.45]I don't hear it now.
[35:17.88]I heard it when the game was loading.
[35:19.54]Not anymore.
[35:20.16]Now it's not happening at all.
[35:22.62]It kind of is.
[35:23.72]What is fucking happening to my computer peripherals?
[35:30.61]Set your power to max performance.
[35:33.86]Okay.
[35:34.14]I'll try it.
[35:36.24]It's gone now.
[35:36.84]Yeah, it's when there's like a loading happening.
[35:38.84]I don't fucking get it, man.
[35:39.99]It's weird.
[35:42.19]It's like a bad USB ports or something.
[35:44.98]But it works perfectly fine when I'm not in the game.
[35:49.18]I don't know.
[35:51.75]That's so, that's just crazy.
[36:02.95]Turn off the Windows USB to save power.
[36:08.48]Was this like in a new... No, it's right into the motherboard.
[36:13.18]The audio buffer size might be an issue.
[36:14.83]I just put it on large and it's still doing it.
[36:19.71]The NVIDIA drivers, roll back the NVIDIA drivers.
[36:24.74]You know, I might just... I mean, it's fine right now.
[36:33.53]Let me see what happens if I go like, yeah, see, it's like.
[36:37.99]I might pull up people's streams for their tours.
[36:41.74]But then this sucks.
[36:47.55]Because I was trying this, I noticed this happening like 20 minutes before I started the stream.
[36:51.13]It wasn't even here like an hour ago, two hours ago.
[36:53.47]That's like how very recent this really is.
[37:01.56]I don't want you to see this.
[37:02.50]You can't see the screen anyways.
[37:06.20]Maybe you need to restart the PC.
[37:07.44]I did twice.
[37:10.12]It's dumb, but it's not unbearable.
[37:16.13]Yeah, this is, like I'm telling you, this is literally one hour ago this started happening.
[37:20.77]Like maybe an hour and a half ago.
[37:22.95]And then there was the USB slot issue with my mouse unplugging from like last week.
[37:26.90]I got a fucking computer problem.
[37:31.54]The sample rate of all the devices.
[37:33.64]I mean, I've been using the Elgato Wavelink
[37:37.96]That's what I have now.
[37:42.70]It'll be alright.
[37:44.53]There's so many perspectives and there's so many audio channels.
[37:51.04]You can watch it on a different stream.
[37:52.32]It's okay.
[37:53.14]It'll be alright.
[37:58.19]I will try some of this other stuff though.
[37:59.35]I do have time.
[38:00.09]What else am I doing?
[38:01.63]So I just quit the game.
[38:03.87]And now it's going to be completely gone.
[38:05.94]Hey, why'd you rage quit Dracula 3?
[38:08.42]Because it was bad.
[38:09.40]But it's okay.
[38:10.06]We're going to drink some beers and we're going to play it.
[38:14.63]What about the bitrate?
[38:15.57]Yeah, it's... I didn't change anything.
[38:19.53]It's just... It's just so weird.
[38:22.84]All the things coming through the wavelength are doing it.
[38:25.58]Which is weird.
[38:27.78]I have a channel for the voice.
[38:29.67]And now it's gone.
[38:30.33]See?
[38:31.19]I'm not in a video game.
[38:32.01]It's gone.
[38:33.85]You need to be drunk to get through it?
[38:37.10]I mean, I don't have to be.
[38:38.63]It's just I thought it was kind of a fun idea.
[38:49.20]How's everybody doing?
[38:49.84]Everybody alright?
[38:55.00]How is the the how's it going so far?
[39:00.35]Because they've got it's been about 10 minutes.
[39:02.63]Do we have a planning phase?
[39:03.79]Everybody, everybody know what they're doing?
[39:11.48]Ster can't make a roof to save his life.
[39:25.24]Don't tell me that.
[39:26.02]I don't want to know that.
[39:28.32]Is it your XLR cables?
[39:29.96]I don't think it is because people coming, the audio coming through Discord also does this when I'm in a game.
[39:39.48]I don't get it.
[39:44.57]It's something to do with how it... This shit's... I'm just gonna... I'm probably gonna open people's streams for them to do tours.
[39:51.32]And I'll have, like, a three or four second delay.
[39:53.86]But they can just take me through it.
[39:55.66]I think that's probably what we're gonna have to do.
[39:59.67]Because I don't want it to be like...
[40:12.73]It's not bad.
[40:13.66]We'll try it.
[40:14.28]I will try it.
[40:20.31]Cap your FPS to 60.
[40:22.13]Yeah, let me try that.
[40:26.07]Just I'll do it in the video control panel.
[40:36.05]Let's cap everything to 60.
[40:48.53]My girlfriend's PC had the same issue.
[40:49.91]Power outage fried, specifically her USB slots.
[40:52.61]Only solution was to replace the motherboard.
[40:54.13]Template solution, try a front panel USB port.
[40:58.16]I don't even know if I can run this through a front panel.
[41:00.84]It has to be through like USB 3 or USB 3.2 or one or whatever.
[41:04.65]Alright, let me just, let me try this.
[41:06.77]I got time to try it.
[41:10.05]My shit's fried.
[41:11.11]Why is my stuff fried?
[41:14.31]I want to go check in on people's streams, but I can't.
[41:18.02]I have to stay completely and totally good.
[41:22.16]Alright, let me try this and see if this can work.
[41:30.16]Let's do, like, house.
[41:32.10]Where's House Flipper?
[41:44.38]Has anybody screamed yet?
[41:50.29]What?
[41:51.89]Why am I asking that?
[41:54.88]That was just me passing time.
[41:59.14]Has anybody screamed yet?
[42:01.25]Oh, okay.
[42:06.15]Alright, max frame rate, let's put it to 60.
[42:10.50]See if that helps.
[42:14.57]Okay.
[42:18.34]Let's try that.
[42:22.86]You know, it's actually, I'm surprised.
[42:24.09]There hasn't been very many people coming in here panicking with questions.
[42:26.61]They're ready.
[42:27.11]They're prepared, I think.
[42:32.50]That's kind of, that's shocking.
[42:39.17]Hold on.
[42:44.49]I didn't hear any crackling.
[42:51.88]Okay, bros.
[42:52.97]I don't hear... Oh.
[42:55.63]Fuck.
[42:56.65]Yeah, I do.
[43:03.08]You should go into Discord.
[43:08.85]Hold on.
[43:10.99]Let me see what I have.
[43:12.23]Yeah, it's still there.
[43:13.37]Yeah.
[43:14.91]It's on.
[43:15.33]I have it on.
[43:16.27]Whoa, it's worse.
[43:18.66]Why is it so much worse?
[43:24.79]Damn.
[43:26.79]What was the other one somebody said to try?
[43:28.41]Put the game in windowed.
[43:29.95]I'll try that.
[43:35.86]It seemed like it was going to work when you first did it.
[43:38.98]I love that this is just a just chatting hangout stream where I'm just, let's talk about technical issues.
[43:45.27]It's so, this is the best part about this is I, I'm not building anything right now.
[43:50.62]So I can take as much time as I need to do this.
[43:54.06]This is great.
[43:54.80]I am, I am as cool as a cucumber right now.
[44:02.29]Okay.
[44:03.79]Let me try putting it, forcing it into a window.
[44:09.36]Maybe running it in like an actual window window will do it.
[44:13.34]That's copium.
[44:20.93]Alright, it's going to be crackly for a second.
[44:23.33]Let's see if I can get it to work.
[44:25.98]I apologize for the crackles.
[44:29.88]Low the sample rate by one.
[44:32.79]Why would it be doing it only when I'm in a game?
[44:35.73]Do you know what I mean?
[44:36.33]Like it doesn't happen when I'm out of a game.
[44:46.23]The Best Buy outfit.
[44:47.19]Hold on.
[44:59.29]Okay.
[45:00.93]Let's go to display.
[45:06.82]Okay.
[45:07.86]I'm currently in a window.
[45:09.12]Okay.
[45:11.66]Okay.
[45:15.44]Let's see, how does that work?
[45:17.02]Is that better?
[45:18.14]Is that still happening?
[45:19.90]It kind of is still happening?
[45:21.11]Kind of?
[45:22.49]Maybe?
[45:22.81]Sort of?
[45:24.15]Maybe?
[45:25.57]Maybe?
[45:25.89]Are we good?
[45:27.13]It's happening sometimes?
[45:28.83]Hold on.
[45:31.24]Hold on.
[45:37.00]My graphics card is spinning up like a fucking cotton candy machine.
[45:47.70]Hello, how are you?
[45:49.17]We are testing this.
[45:50.09]We are going for a test.
[45:51.81]Hello, how are you?
[45:53.93]I'm testing to see if it crackles.
[45:59.08]I think we're good.
[46:05.43]Okay, all I had to do was make the frame rate unlimited and put it in a 1280 by 720 window.
[46:12.92]It still might happen sometimes.
[46:16.06]But we're fucking good.
[46:22.48]They've got one hour left.
[46:23.88]Is everybody alright?
[46:25.21]One hour.
[46:30.59]So now I can show you the game.
[46:37.48]This is such a little window.
[46:41.03]Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do, alright?
[46:44.05]You might hear it sometimes.
[46:48.30]But it is a million times better than it just was.
[46:58.71]Why are you doing 720p in 2025, man?
[47:00.92]Yeah, I can make it bigger in OBS.
[47:07.19]I don't want to show... I don't want to leak anything.
[47:09.21]Because there's something that could be leaked.
[47:12.70]Hold on.
[47:14.64]Something could get leaked and that ain't happening.
[47:19.13]Let me know how this goes if I do this.
[47:28.31]is this better or let's see no it's not better that actually made it a little bit worse let's turn that back off how's that nope that looks alright okay yeah that's going to be the way it's going to have to be like that because now it's back to normal so
[47:53.66]Hey, how come there's 11,000 people watching you figure out streaming?
[47:57.56]I don't know.
[47:59.73]That's a good question.
[48:05.90]Let me turn some other stuff off.
[48:09.20]Hey, guys, let me play.
[48:10.72]Well, I'm not participating, alright?
[48:13.15]That's the way it is.
[48:17.61]Let me try this, too.
[48:24.91]I'll do this.
[48:31.90]Okay.
[48:32.52]I'm going to turn some of this other stuff off.
[48:34.30]Maybe it'll help.
[48:44.90]It's good.
[48:46.04]It'll be good.
[48:49.46]We'll just stretch it.
[48:57.18]Hey!
[48:58.72]Okay.
[48:59.36]So, a couple of things.
[49:02.54]Let me do this.
[49:05.67]Okay.
[49:07.29]So those of you that have been watching, they have an opportunity to go down.
[49:11.02]I really hope people figure this out.
[49:15.69]Because there's so much stuff to be done in here.
[49:19.13]Why are you playing on low settings?
[49:20.43]I just turned them all to low just to see if it would help.
[49:26.49]Dude, your camera is huge right now.
[49:28.15]Well, it's going to be huge for a minute.
[49:35.70]They've got 54 minutes.
[49:39.75]You can build holes.
[49:40.67]Nobody has any questions.
[49:46.44]Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[49:48.04]I feel like people, are they being nice and just don't want to ask?
[49:51.49]Or are they fucking locked in?
[49:58.77]They're just absolutely cooking right now.
[50:01.58]Damn.
[50:07.57]The theme is the ultimate haunted manor.
[50:12.29]And you can do this.
[50:14.51]This is why I wanted to make sure people knew this.
[50:16.37]Turn the time flow off.
[50:18.69]Set it to, you know, let... I don't know.
[50:20.63]Maybe you want to have a daytime horror experience or haunted experience.
[50:25.10]That's fine.
[50:26.02]It's your interpretation.
[50:27.90]But you can do lighting, too.
[50:29.72]Like, we can get some crazy, like, lamps.
[50:34.95]I hate that you can hear all my fucking swallowing.
[50:40.50]And you can turn these on.
[50:42.78]And you could do... There could be some spooky lighting.
[50:47.13]Nice gulps.
[50:48.15]I'm fine.
[50:48.97]It's just I turned off a bunch of shit.
[50:53.96]Yeah, people could really do something crazy with this.
[50:55.94]You could have it kind of coming out of the ground.
[50:57.78]I am... What I want out of this is I want to feel... I want to feel a sense of dread.
[51:06.37]I want to be scared.
[51:09.00]Fucking God damn it.
[51:10.33]I'm turning back on my filter, my noise filter.
[51:19.56]Also, you can change the color.
[51:21.86]I hope they know this because you can change the color of the lights.
[51:28.31]you can do like RGB you can make it oh spooky check this out ready oh make like five of these put it down a hallway you know you think about a situation like this I don't want to give tips but you know we can think about this imagine this but you get it do people make a haunted house right I don't know
[51:53.49]Custom content is great.
[51:54.89]Here's the thing about the custom content and why I took it out of the first round.
[51:57.81]Not just because the multiplayer has that... It's hard to sync everybody to your images.
[52:02.80]But... You're going to have to be... It may be a little bit better to think a little more of what they're going to do.
[52:10.43]But yeah, like, take a look at this.
[52:11.41]You can go... Let's get this, like... You can take a look at that.
[52:19.96]Dude, imagine fucking walking down this shit.
[52:25.43]And what the hell's at the end of that?
[52:42.26]Doesn't have to be perfect.
[52:46.56]Bingo.
[52:48.85]And then, boom.
[52:50.07]Put a door at the end of that.
[52:52.15]Oh man, I don't know if you want to open that door.
[52:57.58]How are you going to do it?
[52:58.36]Rate them with low settings?
[53:00.20]I just did it temporarily.
[53:01.30]I'll turn it back on right now.
[53:10.59]It's not really on low.
[53:12.26]It's just like medium, medium.
[53:19.91]No, it's fine.
[53:22.03]I turned this off, the dynamic resolution.
[53:24.77]I feel like maybe that wasn't helping either.
[53:29.57]Well, you tell me, if I put that on, does that, does the crackling come back?
[53:36.48]Because it might.
[53:48.67]Looks better.
[53:49.65]Are we still the same level of crackle?
[53:51.98]And what I mean by that is I mean almost empty.
[53:54.24]Put global illumination on.
[53:58.06]Dude, I can hear your heartbeat.
[54:02.96]Okay.
[54:05.99]That's pretty sick looking, actually.
[54:17.42]Why is there a trash can?
[54:25.43]Take a look at this.
[54:27.81]You can do particle board.
[54:29.43]Oh, man.
[54:29.89]Like, oh, what's behind that door?
[54:31.21]That's fucked up.
[54:35.26]Look at that.
[54:43.57]If I'm walking here.
[54:46.61]I don't know, man.
[54:48.24]This is a particle board.
[54:49.68]Something twisted is going on back here.
[54:54.55]What's blocking it?
[54:57.93]Why are these blocked?
[55:06.20]Oh, it's a sliding door.
[55:10.15]It has nowhere to slide.
[55:11.27]Hold on.
[55:12.21]I'll fix that.
[55:12.77]I didn't know it was a slider.
[55:22.23]Oh, double sliding doors.
[55:23.59]I could have read.
[55:32.96]We're at this 48 minutes.
[55:35.52]We're almost halfway there.
[55:40.43]This is the halfway mark coming up here.
[55:42.75]I'm going to go warn them all.
[55:44.59]Actually, in their chats, go give them the warning.
[55:49.40]Give them the warning.
[55:59.65]We're at pretty much halftime.
[56:02.61]There we go.
[56:04.00]Let me get a ceiling on this.
[56:14.19]Make it even scarier.
[56:19.86]Dude, I don't know.
[56:20.52]I don't know if I want to go in here.
[56:23.24]They're all working in the daylight.
[56:27.77]Did everybody forget to turn the time to a different time or are they just working in the daylight and then they're going to turn it off?
[56:33.96]Oh, wait.
[56:34.36]OK, I get it.
[56:38.41]I get it.
[56:51.38]I'm sure they'll remember.
[57:02.20]Can I not crouch?
[57:06.78]Oh, right, there we go.
[57:09.65]You need to let them know you can change it.
[57:17.07]Alright, should I go in and start to say we're... Okay, I'm going to let them know.
[57:25.60]I'm going to not... I'm going to just deafen and go in and just give the warning.
[57:31.73]okay I'm not listening I'm not listening I'm not listening I can't hear anything I can't hear anything I literally didn't hear a word I have my thing muted so don't worry thank you okay these are not centered we are getting to the halfway mark are you guys doing alright my lord yeah we're doing alright we're doing okay we're doing alright are the other teams doing alright I checked in on you guys first
[57:54.73]Well, when you get to the team with Ster and Poke and I forgot who you put on that team.
[58:02.34]Take your time.
[58:05.34]Alright.
[58:05.56]Good luck.
[58:09.73]I can't hear anything.
[58:10.59]I can't hear anything.
[58:11.39]I can't hear anything.
[58:12.09]You guys are at the halfway mark.
[58:13.37]45 minutes are remaining.
[58:15.61]Halfway mark.
[58:16.94]Good luck.
[58:19.84]I can't hear anything.
[58:20.68]I am deafened.
[58:21.58]I can't hear anything.
[58:22.26]I can't hear anything.
[58:23.82]We're at the halfway mark.
[58:24.91]You have 45 minutes.
[58:25.91]Good luck.
[58:28.37]That didn't sound very confident.
[58:33.96]It took us a while to figure out the custom assets.
[58:37.08]Okay.
[58:38.46]Okay.
[58:38.58]I'm in streamer mode, so I don't get to hear when you join.
[58:40.91]So every time you speak, it's a fucking jump scare.
[58:42.99]I know.
[58:43.33]I'm so sorry.
[58:44.45]I just want to make sure people know I'm here.
[58:46.54]Okay, hello.
[58:48.72]Alright, I'll see you guys.
[58:50.00]Good luck.
[58:55.47]Well, because another thing too, if you jump into a call and it's just like, oh, by the way, let's put the giant clown over here.
[59:00.92]It's like, oh!
[59:02.40]So you're going to be like, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[59:07.27]You didn't tell him about the lighting.
[59:13.17]It's whatever, they'll figure it out.
[59:16.56]Jeremiah, what's half of 75?
[59:18.06]Half of 75 is... Well, it is... 40?
[59:27.69]I don't know.
[59:33.50]Fucking 30?
[59:35.42]Crackle is back.
[59:36.79]It's probably going to be there.
[59:38.53]Yeah, it is kind of back, isn't it?
[59:42.09]Not really, though.
[59:42.84]It shows up sometimes.
[59:43.60]Sometimes.
[59:46.00]Uh, it's 37 or something.
[59:48.73]Whatever.
[59:49.11]I'd rather them be scared.
[59:52.89]You're a teacher?
[59:53.67]I... I don't give a shit, okay?
[59:57.34]Okay, hold on.
[60:00.66]Was the crackle better when I was on the other resolution?
[60:04.11]Because I feel like I wasn't hearing it when it was on the other resolution.
[60:16.16]I'm going to do this.
[60:17.18]I think there's like, are there floodlights?
[60:19.38]I think there are.
[60:24.37]Yeah, work light.
[60:34.97]I'm going to rotate this.
[60:42.40]It makes some really creepy shit.
[60:54.01]Um.
[60:56.85]Change style.
[61:03.64]Light mode.
[61:05.10]OK, yeah, I'm sure.
[61:15.76]Get the two purple lights.
[61:21.40]Uh, should I, like, go tell everybody that they can do this?
[61:24.64]I feel like I should.
[61:28.17]But... I feel like they... Yes, you should.
[61:33.35]Okay, maybe... Okay, give me a second.
[61:35.10]I'm... Hmm.
[61:44.95]No.
[61:45.27]No.
[61:51.69]Yeah, maybe post it in the channel about it.
[62:06.83]Because... Yeah, I mean, I would say that's pretty important to know.
[62:11.96]That's kind of important.
[62:15.04]Tell them the next time.
[62:16.46]Okay.
[62:16.58]Okay.
[62:20.14]Go silent and don't give any notifications on Discord.
[62:34.84]Just go radio silent.
[62:36.46]That would be fucked up.
[62:45.39]Tell them after they answer your riddles.
[62:48.94]You gotta answer my riddles to be able to get game tips.
[62:58.11]Yeah, since I turned off DLSS, I'm not hearing it that much anymore.
[63:01.90]I don't know, my computer's fucked.
[63:07.24]This is all within the last week and a half.
[63:13.17]Find my pages.
[63:20.74]Alright, what else could you do?
[63:21.88]Let me see what other little things they could do here.
[63:29.85]You could have like, I think the light can be metallic too.
[63:31.99]You can make it kind of interesting looking.
[63:45.35]Add construction noises.
[63:51.96]I could like block the lights too if I really wanted to.
[63:55.70]Okay, here we go.
[64:01.69]Temperature.
[64:02.91]RGB.
[64:07.91]Oh, green is messed up.
[64:19.34]Golf.
[64:32.17]Where's your lava lamp?
[64:33.41]It's not here right now.
[64:34.71]I turned it off.
[64:37.88]Because I wanted the extra screen real estate.
[64:50.71]Fun with light.
[64:52.93]Let me turn these ones off too.
[65:01.24]Can you make Dracula's manor?
[65:05.31]I probably could.
[65:08.06]I want to close this in walls because I want to see if the light stays in one spot.
[65:12.86]You know what I mean?
[65:13.81]If there's nothing to bounce off of.
[65:20.02]How bright is this?
[65:20.78]It's okay.
[65:22.58]It's kind of bright.
[65:26.15]Did you drink the lamp water?
[65:29.50]I thought about it.
[65:30.84]But that's disgusting.
[65:35.71]Okay, you don't look at a lava lamp and go, oh man, I definitely don't have thoughts of what that might taste like.
[65:42.18]It's a bad idea.
[65:43.20]It absolutely should never be done by a human.
[65:45.88]No one should ever do that.
[65:47.18]But it does look the way, it just looks like, man, if that was a flavor of sherbet or something, I would want it.
[66:11.95]sherbert who says sherbert in 2025 I don't know isn't that what what what does that mean that's an old man I sherbert is amazing that's like one of the best ice creams ever if you don't like a good sherbert I don't know man I don't know about that
[66:40.81]Sure, but it's amazing.
[66:48.88]PokesChat is telling them there's five minutes left and he's freaking out.
[66:55.70]Oh, I spilt this.
[66:59.25]Yeah, but isn't Ster and Snuffy are both there.
[67:01.45]They can help.
[67:01.95]They can tell if it's not real.
[67:07.29]What the hell?
[67:18.91]What even is the resolution here?
[67:20.47]1980x1080.
[67:23.76]Should I change it to like a different one?
[67:25.40]What about like that one?
[67:27.70]Is that better?
[67:29.38]Is that better or worse?
[67:32.06]Probably worse.
[67:39.67]That's fucking terrible.
[67:47.20]Is SMA better?
[67:51.07]Is Sma better than Ta?
[67:55.54]I really don't even know what these are, what the difference is.
[68:07.78]Ta is the worst.
[68:09.62]Do none?
[68:11.80]Wouldn't that look awful?
[68:15.63]Don't you want anti-aliasing?
[68:16.93]Yeah, anti-aliasing, you need to have some of it.
[68:22.28]None is based.
[68:30.43]Dude, none is based.
[68:31.49]None is like DirectX 8.
[68:32.75]I'll put that back on.
[68:38.14]It's fine.
[68:45.28]Should I put it on what?
[68:46.00]Medium?
[68:46.54]High?
[68:56.52]Okay.
[68:58.92]It's the crunchiest.
[69:04.99]None turns every game into Arma.
[69:08.17]I love the 25% resolution.
[69:10.44]I'm trying to have my computer explode.
[69:16.56]I don't understand what the fuck happened to this computer.
[69:19.51]The PC, the power supply fried or the motherboard fried in the last four or five days.
[69:23.94]I don't know what happened.
[69:27.14]captain crunch settings hey he's saying that a 3090 cannot handle this game no I'm saying my 3090 got like liquefied in and then the crackling is back what did I do
[70:11.07]Imagine I fucking went through people's houses like this.
[70:16.28]In like a tiny window.
[70:18.32]I actually think that's kind of funny.
[70:19.76]I might do it.
[70:23.51]It's too much your CPU.
[70:24.85]My CPU is fucked, dude.
[70:26.51]I don't know what happened to it.
[70:33.52]You live in the Best Buy salesman dream.
[70:37.77]You still have 30 minutes to solve this puzzle.
[70:40.47]Yeah.
[70:41.77]It is what it is.
[70:42.61]I think it's fine.
[70:45.81]Put it in a smaller window.
[70:50.05]I don't think that even looks that bad.
[70:51.70]Kind of upscaled like this.
[70:54.86]Does it look that bad for you guys?
[70:57.00]I don't think.
[70:57.46]I think it looks fine.
[71:05.33]Let me turn it to daytime so you can see.
[71:10.22]It looks a little crusty.
[71:11.86]I think it looks alright.
[71:13.36]Let's put it on daytime.
[71:14.30]And I'll add some... I'll actually build like a little house here.
[71:22.96]That's cute!
[71:24.40]It look... I think it looks fine.
[71:25.34]I think it looks... it looks actually kind of good.
[71:28.46]What did I do?
[71:29.49]Why does it look good?
[71:38.88]I'm gonna build a little house.
[71:50.97]What do we got?
[71:51.93]We got 32 minutes.
[71:53.21]Now, we're just barely over the halfway mark at 37.2.
[71:56.76]And then we have a room over here.
[72:06.70]Go like this.
[72:10.00]This is... I'm just spitballing, you know?
[72:11.51]I don't... I'm...
[72:20.80]You have an old man face?
[72:25.61]I mean, I have an old man face.
[72:29.03]What the hell does that mean?
[72:35.34]Poke is screaming for help.
[72:41.91]He's alright.
[72:51.52]He is screaming for help.
[72:58.83]I just imagine him like, no, please, somebody help.
[73:02.17]I need help here.
[73:04.79]That didn't look good.
[73:08.68]I can't wait till you see what they're making.
[73:12.90]I can't either.
[73:14.05]I'm excited.
[73:14.63]I'm curious what people are going to do.
[73:21.71]How did I- What the fuck is this house?
[73:39.38]I made like two squares connected in the corner.
[74:01.82]Okay.
[74:03.10]Let's get inside.
[74:03.98]Oh, it's completely beautiful.
[74:08.83]Oh, look at this.
[74:09.51]It's absolutely stunning.
[74:11.11]Let's get some doors.
[74:26.83]Stunning.
[74:33.59]I forgot to make a foundation, but it's OK.
[74:35.52]Sometimes sometimes you make that mistake as a builder.
[74:38.72]It's fine.
[74:48.96]OK, let's get maybe a concept of paint.
[74:56.95]Something fun in this room.
[74:58.54]Oh yes.
[75:16.02]Like a magic, the magic eye room.
[75:31.99]Do you see the spaceship?
[75:37.10]Oh shit, this won't open.
[75:44.67]There we go.
[75:53.33]It's a grandma and a 10 year old boy collabed on this.
[76:15.77]Let's go with.
[76:19.18]Yeah, that's fine, doesn't matter.
[76:22.81]Hey, I'm not being judged on my house.
[76:25.09]I'm just doing it.
[76:28.16]Are we allowed to play along at home?
[76:29.92]Absolutely, it's encouraged.
[76:39.73]You won't be judged, but you can absolutely play.
[77:10.90]I get really hot at night.
[77:19.41]Okay.
[77:19.54]Alright.
[77:19.86]If you actually did this, would it... This is like a fucking video card room.
[77:29.11]If you had your room set up like a video card, would this actually cool you down?
[77:44.64]Yeah, if you had a heat sink room, would it actually work?
[77:51.99]There are no windows in here.
[77:56.26]Dude, that's a sick idea.
[77:59.00]That's a sick idea.
[78:00.68]I'm not, I don't, for, hey, this is for if you're, if you're going to be in a House Flipper event in the future, just make a CPU house and have the bedroom be the video card and have a heat sink and do all this shit.
[78:13.38]Oh, that's what I would have done.
[78:15.08]That's what I would have done.
[78:19.24]Have the kitchen have a CPU on the ground and have pipes laid out all over the place.
[78:30.18]Alright, we got 25 minutes.
[78:31.30]How are we doing?
[78:32.46]Do everybody feel good?
[78:36.21]Do we need extra time?
[78:38.53]Should I call the me?
[78:44.90]I'm going to go ask.
[78:46.25]I'm going to go see how I'm going to check in, see how people are doing.
[78:53.92]I'm not going to listen.
[78:54.94]I'm not going to hear anything.

[79:50.64]He's always so cordial.
[79:53.05]Hello.
[79:53.73]Hi.
[79:53.97]I'm here to jump scare you and ask you a very simple question.
[79:56.89]I'm not looking and I haven't heard anything.
[79:58.47]I just jumped in.
[79:59.08]Is your eyes closed?
[80:00.02]My eyes are closed.
[80:01.22]Close them.
[80:01.96]They're closed.
[80:03.06]Alright, we're good.
[80:04.04]25 minutes remaining.
[80:05.09]Are you guys good?
[80:06.51]I made one roof.
[80:07.69]I'm not good.
[80:08.77]Do you think 25 minutes is good for you guys?
[80:11.62]Is time sufficient for everybody here?
[80:15.14]No, I made one roof.
[80:18.25]He's not doing anything.
[80:21.37]Do you guys need extra time?
[80:24.38]Everyone else started early.
[80:28.58]Wait, are you here?
[80:29.85]I'm here.
[80:30.59]I'm here.
[80:31.39]Is everyone else asking for time?
[80:32.99]Like what's going on?
[80:33.89]I have heard.
[80:34.41]I'm going to keep it anonymous.
[80:36.39]One team has said we're fucking good and they're incredibly confident.
[80:41.38]I know whose team it is.
[80:42.98]I feel like I could guess.
[80:44.87]It's Nandre.
[80:45.83]It's got to be him.
[80:47.80]Alright, I'm going to go to see how the other team is doing.
[80:50.58]But you guys, if five more minutes was added, you'd be... We're feeling behind.
[80:53.97]You're feeling behind, okay.
[80:55.51]Yeah.
[80:56.07]Can I open my eyes?
[80:57.94]They're doing, like, fun stuff.
[80:59.20]I'm doing accent walls and roofs, and it's just... It's not good, man.
[81:07.24]I don't want to jump scare you, but I'm here.
[81:10.46]How are you doing?
[81:11.30]We had about 23 minutes left.
[81:13.21]You guys, do you guys feel behind?
[81:14.35]Do you guys feel like that?
[81:15.13]You guys need more?
[81:16.93]Behind.
[81:17.85]Okay.
[81:19.45]I am going to make an executive decision.
[81:21.30]That's two out of three teams have told me that they have, they feel behind.
[81:26.16]We're going to add a, I'm going to go through each team.
[81:29.89]We're going to add 10 minutes.
[81:32.72]10 minutes have been added to the clock as of right now.
[81:35.32]By the way, just to let you know, you can change the color of lights.
[81:40.63]Lighting can be changed if you put down like a floodlight or a lamp.
[81:43.86]Yeah, yeah.
[81:44.42]You can go into it.
[81:45.76]Okay, so you got it.
[81:46.72]You understand.
[81:47.18]Okay, good.
[81:47.92]Wait, how do you change the RGB color?
[81:50.39]Yes, you can change.
[81:51.65]Instead of white, there's a dropdown for white.
[81:53.85]You can make it RGB.
[81:54.85]You can make whatever you want.
[81:55.55]You can change the brightness.
[81:56.77]You can do that to pretty much every light source in the game.
[82:00.98]Because it starts at white and you have to change it to RGB.
[82:04.38]Where do you change it?
[82:05.29]So if you go to like, for instance, you put a light down.
[82:09.61]So put down like, you know, like floor lamp or floodlight or whatever you want to do.
[82:15.92]When you put it down, I think you can do it before you put it down.
[82:18.28]But after you put it down, if you get the architect tool, right click architect tool and hit R, change style.
[82:26.43]You can then change everything about the light and then light mode.
[82:29.14]It's white to start.
[82:30.92]You can change temperature, brightness, RGB.
[82:33.71]And there's all the colors you can choose from to make it whatever you want.
[82:37.82]Okay.
[82:38.32]Yeah, that architect tool is very helpful.
[82:41.07]Yeah, the architect tool is very helpful.
[82:42.95]Can change a lot of stuff.
[82:44.95]Okay.
[82:46.76]Alright.
[82:47.08]I'm going to add 10 minutes.
[82:48.08]Good luck.
[82:48.90]I hope you guys knock it out of the park.
[82:51.42]Thanks.
[82:55.45]My eyes are closed, but I want to confirm something with you guys.
[82:57.41]Big, big, big deal.
[82:58.95]Huge.
[82:59.11]This is going to be big for you guys.
[83:00.24]10 minutes have been added to the clock.
[83:03.69]Oh, man.
[83:04.71]Big deal.
[83:05.39]I heard you guys needed it, and I played favorites, and I decided that because I like this team, so I'm going to add 10 minutes.
[83:13.07]That was the only reason.
[83:14.47]I appreciate that you did that for only us.
[83:17.27]Yeah.
[83:17.41]Also, do you guys understand how to change the color of lamps and light sources?
[83:23.10]Yeah.
[83:23.22]Why?
[83:23.46]Are you looking at our base?
[83:24.64]I'm... No.
[83:27.01]I love the way you poked.
[83:28.31]You called it a base.
[83:30.54]Why did you call it a base?
[83:32.82]I said, haunted manor.
[83:35.54]And I heard the word base come out of your mouth.
[83:38.11]Content manor?
[83:39.51]No, ultimate manor.
[83:42.39]This is our content manor.
[83:43.75]Alright, alright.
[83:44.63]Get out.
[83:45.17]You guys know how to change light colors and everything?
[83:48.88]No.
[83:49.72]Okay.
[83:51.62]Put a light source down, a lamp, a floor light, any light source in the game.
[83:55.91]Pull out the architect tool.
[83:57.11]Right-click architect tool.
[83:59.50]Hit R, change style.
[84:01.52]You can change everything about that light.
[84:03.78]Oh, you can change the bulb.
[84:05.30]You can make it RGB.
[84:06.90]They see the dropdown for white.
[84:07.99]You can do a dropdown to RGB.
[84:10.11]You can change the brightness.
[84:11.91]Also, time of day.
[84:13.31]If you guys want a daytime haunted manor, that's fine.
[84:16.91]But tab, property settings, change the property to a house, time flow off, and put it whatever time you want.
[84:25.65]Wait, how do I do that?
[84:26.25]Sorry.
[84:26.67]Sorry, I was locked in.
[84:28.28]Tab.
[84:29.66]Tab.
[84:30.12]Property settings.
[84:31.74]Make sure you're on house.
[84:32.64]Time flow off.
[84:33.48]Starting hour.
[84:35.22]Make it whatever time you want.
[84:36.30]It's gonna be fucking dark if you make it dark, though.
[84:38.79]So, make sure you can operate that way before.
[84:41.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[84:42.01]Make it dark.
[84:43.13]Alright.
[84:43.85]See you later.
[84:44.33]Good luck.
[84:44.87]You get ten minutes of banana to the clock.
[84:46.82]Thank you.
[84:47.24]Okay, good.
[84:53.28]I wanted to do that.
[84:53.96]I forgot to leave.
[84:56.77]Alright, does anybody else need to hear that?
[84:59.61]I feel like, I feel like DougDougStans and Andre are locked in and they don't need any help.
[85:04.10]Team 1 needs to know that.
[85:18.95]You told 1 out of 3 about daytime.
[85:20.97]You told 2 out of 3 about the lights.
[85:22.75]Who did I tell about the lights?
[85:26.59]You added 11?
[85:27.05]Hey, it... Don't matter.
[85:33.44]Who did I tell about the lights?
[85:45.42]One in three I told about... Okay, I gotta tell the lights to one.
[85:48.46]Okay.
[85:48.94]I don't want to be annoying, though.
[85:57.79]Tell team one about the lights.
[85:59.43]Alright, I will.
[86:04.04]Checking in one more time.
[86:05.14]I got one more thing to say.
[86:08.81]You guys have the time of day thing, correct?
[86:12.08]You can change... We can shift it, right?
[86:14.83]Yes, okay.
[86:15.51]So if you hit tab and you go to property settings... We want the night.
[86:21.65]We're creatures of the night.
[86:22.89]Make sure you turn time flow off.
[86:24.62]You can work during the day.
[86:25.76]You can do whatever you want.
[86:26.72]But just before, you know, you can change that.
[86:30.40]I think the darkest you can make it is, I think, 11 or 12.
[86:34.17]But, you know, maybe your thing is daytime.
[86:35.99]That's fine.
[86:36.75]Also, did I tell you guys about changing the color of lamps and lights?
[86:40.99]We saw that.
[86:42.13]See, we're plugged in.
[86:42.95]We have living room general chat open on our other monitors.
[86:45.50]Alright.
[86:45.98]So you guys are plugged in.
[86:47.08]And I told chat this.
[86:48.32]I said team one is locked in.
[86:51.13]You guys are locked in.
[86:52.07]Good to go.
[86:52.75]So true.
[86:53.89]Alright.
[86:54.17]So you guys look.
[86:57.37]Doug, these look great, by the way.
[86:58.92]This rules.
[86:59.92]Okay.
[87:03.04]Who else needs to know about anything?
[87:04.55]Team one's locked in.
[87:05.67]I am actually, honestly, I'll make a prediction here for you.
[87:10.27]I think team one is the favorite right now.
[87:21.38]Team three need to know about the lights.
[87:23.37]Well, they need to know about the time of day.
[87:29.03]Okay.
[87:30.98]A bunch of doors down.
[87:31.70]This is the last time I'm going to pop in before I'm probably done.
[87:34.50]But I do have to make sure.
[87:35.48]Somebody said that I don't think you guys saw this or maybe the time of day.
[87:41.23]If you go to hit tab where the host is, go to property settings, turn time flow off.
[87:48.26]And you can set the time whatever you want.
[87:50.41]You can work during the day.
[87:51.55]Maybe your thing is a day thing.
[87:53.71]But if you want it to be dark, you can change it to dark.
[87:56.85]And turn time flow off.
[87:59.60]Very good.
[88:00.74]Good luck.
[88:05.88]Look at me, right?
[88:08.67]Look at me.
[88:12.37]Team 1 doesn't know about the time extension.
[88:22.44]Shit.
[88:23.30]I just went... Yeah, they do.
[88:24.86]Yeah, they do.
[88:25.83]Yes, they do.
[88:26.99]I saw them over here and they confirmed it.
[88:30.31]They're reading the chat right now.
[88:31.81]Yeah, they get it.
[88:32.63]Team 1 is locked in, guys.
[88:34.56]Team 1's locked the fuck in.
[88:39.22]You look like a villain in a Hideo Kojima game.
[88:43.08]Well, I got booted out of the HOA, so I decided to unbutton the top button.
[88:53.53]And today, this is going to be a clean day because we've been, it's been about an hour and a half, hour and 20 minutes.
[89:01.02]They will be done at around the, like, what, hour and 45 minutes or so.
[89:07.34]There's only three places to go through, so that'll probably take about 30 to 40 minutes for all the tours.
[89:13.46]So this would be about three.
[89:14.54]This ain't going to go that long.
[89:16.22]This ain't going to go long.
[89:25.83]Team one is doing too well.
[89:26.95]You need to take their time away.
[89:28.72]No, that's not how it works.
[89:35.00]Team four despawned.
[89:42.97]Well, it's funny.
[89:43.61]Originally, this was going to be teams of four.
[89:48.40]There's going to be four people across these games.
[89:52.16]So they're all going to be working together.
[89:53.97]But we had nine to start with today.
[89:56.49]So I was like, alright, we'll do three.
[90:00.54]Team three is going to be eliminated.
[90:02.32]I don't think, don't put that in my head.
[90:07.89]Why does Steam say that you're a developer of this game?
[90:12.45]it does have I I'm considered a dev that's funny why does it say that your stream is under watch the dev play yeah so if you take a look here
[90:34.96]This alligator and turtle wallpaper.
[90:40.71]By the way, look.
[90:42.86]We're on Steam here.
[90:44.88]Store page.
[90:46.66]I'm talking to you right now.
[90:47.86]Did you just land on the House Flipper 2 Steam page?
[90:51.29]I'm talking to you.
[90:53.05]Welcome.
[90:54.53]Check what's below me.
[90:56.20]We got...
[90:57.39]Co-op DLC.
[90:58.45]We got Scooby-Doo coming soon.
[91:00.37]Hey, I just... Don't freak out yet.
[91:03.26]Take a look at that.
[91:04.80]You can buy it right now.
[91:07.82]Look at this.
[91:08.94]Alligator and tortoise.
[91:11.75]I put that up there.
[91:13.05]I put it up.
[91:13.85]I did that.
[91:16.69]Don't leave.
[91:17.01]Don't leave.
[91:17.43]Don't leave.
[91:17.79]Oh, you can leave.
[91:18.43]You can leave.
[91:23.12]Wave goodbye to me.
[91:31.56]I feel like that'd be weird.
[91:32.46]If you go to the store page, oh, here, check out the dev playing the game.
[91:35.57]And it's just like, hey, hey, how are you?
[91:38.13]Oh, it's good to see you.
[91:39.72]Hey, I might be, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but you just landed on the House Flipper 2 Steam page.
[91:44.91]And what a treat you found yourself in.
[91:50.20]If I did that for the next 30 minutes, I'd hit somebody, I'd get somebody.
[91:59.57]There are 1,500 people watching over there?
[92:02.06]What?
[92:02.50]Wow!
[92:03.10]That's actually a lot.
[92:06.18]There's 1,500 viewers on Steam watching it right now.
[92:09.24]What?
[92:09.54]That's crazy!
[92:19.45]Cool.
[92:20.51]I keep forgetting you can actually do that on Steam.
[92:23.00]I forget that that's a thing.
[92:27.42]It was 300, now it's 2,200.
[92:30.86]Damn.
[92:31.46]Okay.
[92:32.58]Alright.
[92:33.69]That's a lot.
[92:36.13]Everyone's just leaving here to go watch over there.
[92:38.59]Hey, watch wherever you want.
[92:40.38]I'm excited.
[92:41.12]I'll tell you another reason why I'm excited.
[93:12.25]No, no, no.
[93:12.92]It has nothing to do with the game.
[93:14.36]Well, it has to do with the game.
[93:15.70]I'm not announcing anything.
[93:17.24]Like, no, no.
[93:18.96]Let me fix this.
[93:20.33]I'm just saying I'm excited about this event for a very specific reason.
[93:24.09]I got nothing to announce.
[93:25.53]I announced my little miniature thing already.
[93:27.43]By the way, if you missed the beginning of the stream, let's talk about this.
[93:32.22]All 24 participants.
[93:34.92]Doesn't matter if you were eliminated in the first round, if you make it through to whatever, if you have you doing this one, everybody is getting a little custom, custom made miniature of the house they made in round one.
[93:52.26]Doesn't matter what the hell it was.
[93:53.71]It's going to be as close as I can get it one to one.
[93:59.58]So even if you participated at all, you're going to get this.
[94:07.01]Yeah, Joel is going to get one.
[94:08.66]And here's the funny thing about Joel's.
[94:10.96]I don't know.
[94:13.70]There was the plane.
[94:14.98]But I also don't don't try to tell me that I'm not going to put like a square, have it custom made like poop pool.
[94:23.79]You don't think I'm going to try to have that happen.
[94:25.42]I'm going to make it as one to one as I can.
[94:26.80]That's going to be I want to hold this.
[94:29.56]I didn't want to tell people this until after that first round, because it doesn't matter what you made.
[94:33.37]It's like, wait a minute.
[94:35.94]I'm going to get like a cube and then like a poop pool and like a tree house on like a little miniature.
[94:43.79]Like I didn't want people to know this because I wanted it to be kind of a surprise.
[94:49.16]A toilet museum miniature.
[94:51.98]Yeah, I'm going to try.
[94:54.81]There's a lot of it's going to take a lot of effort, but I thought it was worth doing.
[94:59.16]I thought it was fun.
[95:05.13]Now, obviously, every single minute detail is not going to work, right?
[95:10.06]But as close as it... close enough for the gist of it, at least, to make it look cool.
[95:16.55]And from the outside, and maybe a little bit inside, too, that you can see and do, I want it to be at least... It's really funny because the toilet museum is just a big rectangle with this kind of brick on the outside.
[95:26.96]That is what they are going to get.
[95:29.13]And the inside will be close.
[95:32.61]I want to make sure it's what they made.
[95:45.40]How are you getting them made?
[95:47.58]It is a process that we, and when I say we, I mean there's going to be at least three or four people that are going to be on this.
[95:55.07]There are lots of custom builders that we're going to be contacting.
[96:00.78]So, it's a logistics thing.
[96:03.40]It's going to take some time.
[96:04.40]It's going to take some, obviously, you know, power and...
[96:09.14]and money, but it's going to happen.
[96:11.52]This is not something they're going to get next Thursday.
[96:14.85]This will probably be something that they get somewhere into the summer here.
[96:18.69]But immediately after this event ends, it's going to get started immediately.
[96:25.78]You need power and money.
[96:27.34]Well, I mean like people to do things and... What is the actual winner or winners going to get?
[96:38.70]Okay, do you know what?
[96:41.49]I don't want to leak it.
[96:42.33]I don't want to leak it because it sucks.
[96:44.67]Alright, there's a lot going into this miniature thing, okay?
[96:49.22]The winner of this event is... You'll get something.
[96:52.24]Yeah, you'll get something.
[96:53.38]You'll get something.
[96:56.31]You'll get something.
[97:02.22]I mean, it doesn't suck, but I would think it is...
[97:07.31]80 to 90% less cool than the other thing.
[97:14.98]Could you give them a free copy of the Scooby-Doo DLC?
[97:18.00]Alright, that's actually really funny.
[97:20.48]And if they confirm that they can do that, that's hilarious.
[97:24.51]I think that, don't tell them, by the way.
[97:26.77]Don't tell anybody this.
[97:28.19]Shit, I did, I fucked this whole thing up.
[97:30.51]What I should have done.
[97:31.40]Oh my God.
[97:32.90]I should, okay.
[97:34.22]I should have had the, I should have announced the miniatures at all.
[97:37.48]The event should have ended, and the winner gets a free copy of the Scooby-Doo DLC, and that's what they win.
[97:45.11]And then everyone's like, oh, alright.
[97:48.82]Okay.
[97:50.56]Let's go.
[97:51.90]Thanks for the invite, dude.
[97:53.00]And then once that's over, I go, alright.
[97:55.39]Hey, by the way, everybody's getting the miniature houses.
[97:57.61]I fucked it up.
[97:58.83]Too bad.
[98:05.20]Dev said they could get folks the DLC.
[98:08.61]Oh, nice.
[98:10.81]OK, that's what you win.
[98:11.95]That is the prize of the whoever wins.
[98:17.72]Yeah, but this round is.
[98:21.60]They will be there'll be multiple winners, so this is this is the last round.
[98:27.51]This is the this is the round to determine the winners of this event.
[98:47.61]Yes.
[98:54.14]It's because the mic is right... the mic may as well be connected to my throat.
[98:59.44]Okay.
[99:01.67]That's why you hear all this shit.
[99:03.31]This is... It's right here.
[99:10.06]THC gulp?
[99:12.64]That was not a THC gulp.
[99:15.02]That was a coffee.
[99:25.41]Why is there no sound?
[99:26.97]I'm just kind of floating around, you'll see.
[99:28.50]Like here, you can... Are you going to give away a real house?
[99:36.07]I am not.
[99:38.25]Are you going to build something?
[99:39.43]Yeah, I... Okay, we're in like the 15 minutes left.
[99:42.09]I got to kind of... You know what I mean?
[99:45.68]I would be building something right now, but I got to pay attention to everything right now.
[99:54.07]Because then we're going to make sure that I get the house files.
[99:55.85]I can open them, make sure I can see the stuff.
[99:58.27]Because if I open the host file and I cannot see the images, then I need to go watch the host stream.
[100:08.70]That's how it's going to have to happen.
[100:11.23]This is what I've built so far.
[100:12.41]I didn't even see the inside, dude.
[100:14.69]Excuse me.
[100:22.32]What are you building right now?
[100:27.58]Well, I gave you that great graphics card idea.
[100:30.92]Make sure that if you build it, you need to spray paint.
[100:33.71]In bright yellow spray paint.
[100:37.13]Jerma gave me this idea.
[100:39.58]Using this with his expressed, written permission.
[100:44.23]Jerma985, trademark.
[100:48.61]Thank you, Jerma.
[100:49.66]And then put a huge advertisement for my fucking stream.
[101:03.19]Can we get a break to go pee?
[101:05.83]Actually, you know what?
[101:06.75]I should do that.
[101:08.11]So we got 15 minutes left.
[101:09.96]I'm going to keep the timer up.
[101:12.70]I'm just going to be BRB.
[101:14.47]I'll be back in two minutes or so.
[101:16.57]I'm going to just go pee.
[101:18.95]I'm looking forward to it.
[101:20.04]I wonder what they're going to make.
[101:21.28]I'll be right back.
[107:24.80]Hello.
[107:29.33]Eight minutes are remaining.
[107:31.67]Oh boy.
[107:37.10]Team three is going to blow up.
[107:39.35]Uh oh.
[107:40.05]Do we have drama over on team three?
[107:42.15]Drama confirmed.
[107:52.79]What I will say is I've got to make sure that people... Yes, okay.
[108:07.69]We've got to make sure that people do the... Whoever the host is, they need to make sure that they're saving the game.
[108:19.12]And then that host needs to... Actually, I'm going to get over there now.
[108:23.30]Wait, I don't want you to see this.
[108:26.41]You can't see this, sorry.
[108:28.31]Hey, that's who's playing.
[108:29.77]Look at that.
[108:35.70]Yeah, yeah.
[108:36.30]I would just leak something important.
[108:46.82]Okay.
[108:48.22]Because I need their house file.
[108:51.47]When I have their house file, I can load it.
[108:56.46]Yeah, I'm just going to sit right here.
[109:01.64]We got just about almost five minutes left.
[109:09.98]I'm excited.
[109:10.88]This is what it's all about coming up right here.
[109:19.68]Did you put product in your hair?
[109:21.86]I did not.
[109:24.03]I did not.
[109:35.54]I just squeezed it and Holly put it in a little bun or whatever the hell's back here.
[109:50.24]I need to make sure that I, because I'm going to be hosting.
[109:54.97]And I'm going to have to put the code and I don't want anyone to see the code before it's there.
[110:16.41]Five minutes remaining.
[110:24.82]You have a Bob?
[110:25.80]By the way, I have a sad announcement for everybody.
[110:31.57]The hair is coming down.
[110:35.53]Hair is coming down soon.
[110:40.82]We're going back to kind of the way it was a while ago.
[110:50.29]Farewell, yeah.
[110:51.03]Farewell to the hair.
[111:01.91]When the timer is up, I would like to have everybody get dragged into the channel I'm currently in right now.
[111:12.73]We're going to drag everybody up.
[111:18.83]We're getting there.
[111:19.52]Only four minutes.
[111:23.72]I think we're going to get a couple of freakouts.
[111:26.03]Are we going to freak out?
[111:27.17]I like to watch these after it's done.
[111:30.34]It's actually really fun to go and see what everybody is doing from all the perspectives.
[111:35.94]It's like my favorite part.
[111:38.00]So I usually wait till the event is over over.
[111:48.96]We need countdown music.
[112:28.75]Wait, it's too early.
[112:31.35]It's too early to do that.
[112:32.67]I needed to do that at one minute.
[112:41.37]Why is it counting?
[112:42.63]Why is it beeping?
[112:44.81]We've got under three minutes remaining.
[112:46.71]Under three minutes!
[112:47.68]Did you hear that?
[112:48.76]Ladies and gentlemen.
[112:52.06]Pizza Tower music?
[112:54.49]Actually, that's better.
[112:58.57]Come on, here we go.
[113:00.07]This is three minutes.
[113:10.79]Come on, two minutes.
[113:28.32]I wish I could just broadcast this into all of their chats right now.
[113:32.35]I probably can, but I'm not a Discord Andy.
[113:35.31]I don't even know how to use this fucking program.
[113:48.14]One minute and 40 seconds.
[113:59.98]Um, let me do the thing, let me do the thing where I'm at the fucking club.
[114:11.96]What?
[114:12.08]What's that?
[114:12.34]Yeah.
[114:12.46]You're right, yeah.
[114:13.59]Yeah.
[114:14.45]You're screaming as loud as you can into my ear.
[114:15.99]Yeah.
[114:16.35]What's that?
[114:16.93]Yeah.
[114:17.39]Yeah.
[114:31.53]Yeah.
[114:35.44]54 seconds.
[114:47.79]Oh, with the TikTok, with the TikTok coming in.
[115:02.60]30 seconds.
[115:22.64]Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[115:29.22]That's it.
[115:30.50]That's it.
[115:31.49]GG.
[115:35.91]Pencils down.
[115:39.13]Pencils down.
[115:40.45]That is it.
[115:44.36]Pencils down.
[115:45.22]Time, your one hour and 25 minutes has elapsed.
[115:52.87]We usually give like a minute or two for people to finish and do whatever they want to do.
[115:57.49]That's okay.
[115:59.74]It's pencil, it's a soft pencils down.
[116:01.56]It's a very soft pencils down.
[116:04.12]It's okay.
[116:07.06]Okay.
[116:07.72]Pencils down.
[116:12.83]Am I yelling pencils down?
[116:14.11]I'm from a different room.
[116:16.46]Yeah, let's bring everybody into the call.
[116:20.10]Pull them all up.
[116:24.11]That is it.
[116:25.57]And then the payoff is going to be the well.
[116:27.49]Time, time, time.
[116:29.16]You're all up here.
[116:29.98]You're all up here.
[116:30.66]You're all up here.
[116:31.52]Oh, that's why.
[116:32.48]It's not even going to work.
[116:33.74]Hold on.
[116:34.36]GG.
[116:35.52]Guys, our subway.
[116:36.20]Is the subway good?
[116:36.97]Oh, they didn't move us, right?
[116:38.51]You moved.
[116:39.25]Yeah, we're in the main channel now.
[116:42.31]Oh.
[116:42.85]I think it's fine.
[116:43.23]I think it's fine to save.
[116:44.27]Oh, wow.
[116:44.47]If it isn't team two and three.
[116:46.66]Listen closely.
[116:48.08]How do we pass the file over?
[116:51.14]The host of the game right now, please save the game with all those stuff.
[117:00.73]You named the house, right?
[117:01.70]You already have a name for the house and everything?
[117:03.71]Oh, don't forget to save it with the dark to night time.
[117:08.00]Yeah, make sure it's whatever time you want it to be.
[117:10.06]Turn time flow off.
[117:11.78]Save it.
[117:12.72]And then that file, it should be in that folder, that sandbox folder.
[117:18.07]You're going to bring that file.
[117:19.73]You're going to drop it over here in the chat room that we have.
[117:26.36]I... You can right click open it in your file explorer to get it right away.
[117:31.21]Perfect.
[117:31.50]And make sure it's the right one.
[117:32.56]Make sure it's the house that you've just been working on.
[117:34.11]Drop it over here.
[117:38.39]I love how the file name is .house.
[117:40.84]Yeah, it's .house.
[117:43.38]Let's hope that I can see all the custom content, if you have any.
[117:46.40]If I cannot see any custom content, the other play here is the host of the game is going to just do the tour while I pull their stream up.
[117:58.18]That's probably the best way to do it.
[118:00.19]But I'm confident.
[118:01.11]This has been tested a few times.
[118:02.27]It should work.
[118:04.09]How do you guys feel?
[118:05.33]I wish we had more time.
[118:10.02]Stressed, but good.
[118:11.84]Yeah, a few hours would have been nice.
[118:16.96]okay um good luck I think we wasted 40 minutes yeah I definitely think we like played patty cake for 40 minutes but that's the kind of team team practice you need to make a winning country you know okay so but that's good to hear alright I think everybody feels okay uh how is it gonna work just like last time
[118:40.67]We only have three houses to go through this time instead of 12.
[118:43.90]So it should go a little smoother, a lot faster.
[118:46.22]We're going to start with Doug, Doug, Stans, and Nandre.
[118:49.87]We're going to start with you guys.
[118:52.41]I do have to make something very, very clear.
[118:56.16]This is going to be a double elimination.
[119:02.52]Two teams are going to be dropped from this.
[119:05.38]that makes sense only one yeah that's like that's the way to do it this is the final three yeah whoever wins this wins the freaking competition alright two teams are going to be gone from this so let's get started alright who is the host of doug stans and Andre
[119:31.08]I am okay I am gonna be the host are you gonna be streaming your site oh sorry like Discord streaming your site or shall I check your stream uh don't check mine you exploded last time right Jerma maybe just go to your Twitch stream
[119:47.63]Yeah, but my computer is literally frantic.
[119:50.34]I've been having so many problems.
[119:53.08]This would be more of a Jerma-centric experience, so probably we should go off of your POV, even if it's just streaming.
[119:58.81]Yes, yes, yes.
[120:00.17]So I'm going to... Stream sniping, stream sniping.
[120:03.07]Let me just make sure I get this in here.
[120:04.55]Yeah, you can stream snipe me.
[120:07.42]Let me make sure I drop this in here, and let's pray that this works.
[120:13.13]So are you going to be... Wait, wait, wait, wait, Jeremy.
[120:16.80]Are you going to be walking around the level with us or by yourself?
[120:20.76]Okay.
[120:21.62]I am going to host the game.
[120:23.77]And I'm going to put an invite code in here.
[120:25.21]Oh, you're going to host.
[120:26.15]Okay, let me disconnect that.
[120:27.13]Okay, that's fine.
[120:28.09]You may not see the custom content.
[120:30.03]Whoever the host was, whoever was posting... We're fine.
[120:32.24]We don't need it.
[120:32.86]If you know where things are.
[120:35.16]Alright, I am going to host.
[120:36.14]I have cross-platform off.
[120:39.13]I'm creating a game.
[120:40.07]I'm going to post it in the chat right now.
[120:43.10]Okay, I'm looking.
[120:45.03]I almost put it in my Twitch chat.
[120:48.07]Put it in Twitch chat, baby.
[120:50.07]Let them all join.
[120:51.68]There it is.
[120:52.28]There's plenty of room in our house.
[120:55.48]The urge to read the room code out loud.
[120:59.31]Yeah.
[121:00.52]So we're not joining, right?
[121:01.38]Just watching this one?
[121:02.14]You were just watching, yeah.
[121:03.20]This is just for that team.
[121:05.16]It says the host does not allow for cross-platform play.
[121:07.73]Are you playing on a Nintendo Switch, Jerma?
[121:10.65]Check the box to cross-platform off.
[121:12.55]You have to turn off platform for you.
[121:14.12]Oh, you have to... Oh, okay.
[121:17.36]Oh, I did the same thing.
[121:19.00]Yeah, yeah, we're in, we're in, we're in.
[121:20.68]I'm going to make sure I can hear you guys all well.
[121:23.93]Yippee!
[121:24.45]I should be able to.
[121:24.99]Yeah.
[121:26.30]Okay, everybody is in.
[121:27.76]I'm going to pick the map.
[121:30.59]I see it right there.
[121:33.07]And I'm going to play.
[121:34.87]I'm going to open it.
[121:36.50]Are we all ready?
[121:38.42]Yeah, and I think you can do daytime.
[121:39.82]If that's your selection, just do daytime.
[121:41.92]I don't have a selection.
[121:44.71]Good, then don't even worry about it.
[121:45.83]Alright, I'm going to hit edit property and we're going to go.
[121:49.01]Let's see what happens.
[121:51.03]I'm so scared.
[121:51.69]Can you look down when you get in just to make sure?
[121:54.00]Yeah, I'm going to look down.
[121:54.72]I'm going to look straight down.
[121:55.70]Alright, alright.
[122:02.74]Yeah, Mom, we're going first.
[122:03.96]It's okay.

[122:06.34]Alright, I have loaded.
[122:07.18]It looks like you guys are loading.
[122:09.21]Yeah, still working on it.
[122:09.85]Now, the dream is, Nandra, you can see the custom content.
[122:12.83]That's the dream.
[122:15.05]I'll let you know right now.
[122:16.42]Oh, yeah, you're going to have to look down.
[122:18.30]I'm looking down?
[122:19.72]You're going to have to look down and come this way.
[122:21.00]Okay, then go forward.
[122:22.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[122:23.45]I'm looking down?
[122:25.69]And you're going to just hold W. Hold on.
[122:28.19]I can see it.
[122:28.87]Hold on.
[122:30.02]I've got to turn you guys up.
[122:32.44]Okay.
[122:33.31]You have to turn me up.
[122:34.66]Can you guide me where I need to go?
[122:37.38]Double tap space and just hold straight.
[122:40.05]Yeah, W forward.
[122:41.67]I'm not looking at anything.
[122:44.08]We'll move him straight down.

[122:48.47]Okay, can I shoot right from the ground?
[122:50.61]Yeah, so now go straight up, and now you're facing away from the house.
[122:55.57]Whenever you're ready to begin, we can kick it off.
[122:57.70]Yeah, you can turn around whenever you're ready to begin.
[123:00.14]Actually, before you start, we asked you what your biggest fear is, and you told us something.
[123:07.07]You said it's letting down somebody you love, but we know what your real fear is.
[123:11.89]Yeah?
[123:12.41]It's a certain addiction you have.
[123:14.43]Turn around, Jerma.

[126:40.74]I'm not kidding.
[126:41.30]Listen, this is going to take a minute or two.
[126:43.53]I'm going to TL;DR speedrun this stream story.
[126:46.17]I had a dream where there was a self-cleaning bathroom that I went into.
[126:49.07]It was at like a fucking TwitchCon or something.
[126:50.93]They had rows of these.
[126:51.89]They were this high.
[126:52.55]They looked like trash can lids.
[126:54.20]And they would do like the clean the whole bathroom.
[126:57.98]It was like, oh, this is kind of cool.
[126:59.70]So I went in to use it, and it had just done a cycle.
[127:02.54]It did a cycle while I was in there, by the way.
[127:05.51]I started to go to the bathroom in one of these, and the cycle started again, and I had to, like, stop pissing, and I was like, what am I supposed to do?
[127:13.20]And all the lids closed, and the washing started happening, and I freaked out.
[127:16.54]That's the TL;DR.
[127:18.48]But this is a crazy bathroom.
[127:20.42]We'll go ahead and hold that in, Mr. Elbertson.
[127:22.43]There's more games for you to play.

[130:46.75]You know, this, this kind of pain, I've felt this a lot before, but this is something really reprehensible, father.
[130:57.19]My high school graduation.
[131:00.59]Uh-huh.
[131:01.62]You're sick.
[131:03.59]You can't stop gambling.
[131:05.97]You can't just fucking focus for five minutes on the most important day of my life.
[131:14.77]Oh my god, dude.
[131:15.93]Mr. Elbertson, the crowd has cleared out.
[131:18.54]The ceremony ended over two hours ago.
[131:21.02]I've been sitting here waiting for you, Dad.
[131:24.48]Cap and gown, diploma in hand.
[131:27.45]I'm just, I'm sick of this life.
[131:31.29]I cannot wait to get away to school next year.
[131:34.64]And honestly, the only thing you've been good for so far is paying off this tuition that's coming up.
[131:41.46]Well, I mean, this is quite the establishment, son.
[131:48.30]First of all, I'm sorry that this is... I didn't know that this casino also rents out their venues for high school graduations.
[131:55.79]You're sorry?
[131:57.01]That's your apology?
[131:58.34]You're sorry?
[131:59.14]Dad, I...
[132:04.11]Honestly, the only thing I want right now in my life is to just be so far away removed from you.
[132:10.30]Just give me the money for tuition and you're never going to see me again.
[132:14.86]Give me the money.
[132:16.75]Alright, here you go.
[132:17.41]How much do you need?
[132:18.61]How much do you need?
[132:22.07]I need $1,000.
[132:26.90]Mr. Elbertson, thank you for visiting the casino.
[132:29.56]We hope you come back next time.
[132:31.28]Wait.
[132:32.85]Dad.
[132:34.48]Where did you get the money to gamble?
[132:36.11]We've already gone over this.
[132:39.07]Dad, you didn't.
[132:40.43]Dad, you didn't do this.
[132:44.74]What have you done?
[132:46.90]Thank you for joining.
[132:49.76]And that's your biggest nightmare.
[132:51.90]The ultimate haunted mansion.
[132:54.27]Jeremy Elbertson.
[132:58.63]If it landed on 26, that's an 8X.
[133:03.48]Why did you come all in?
[133:05.18]I don't want to go to college eight times.
[133:08.54]Hey!
[133:08.92]He's in the way with the register!
[133:11.24]I can fly!
[133:13.35]Dad!
[133:13.97]Dad, come back!
[133:14.79]He can fly!
[133:15.85]Fuck you!
[133:18.03]How much is in here?
[133:19.97]Dad!
[133:21.69]Uh oh, no, son!
[133:22.84]Son, meet me at the water tower!
[133:26.42]Da- Son?
[133:33.06]Look!
[133:33.82]Look what I got!
[133:34.34]Look in the sky!
[133:36.14]Son!
[133:36.86]Look in the sky!
[133:38.64]Can you grab it from me?
[133:41.11]I'm here, Dad.
[133:42.13]Oh, it's deleted.
[133:44.09]Oh.
[133:45.19]Oh, wait, that's... And that's how Jeremy and his son's relationship was permanently ruined.
[133:50.98]That was fucking phenomenal.
[133:53.42]Great job.
[133:55.34]I'm not gonna lie, psyching myself up for that conversation, I started crying a little bit.
[134:02.00]that was wild that was a wild journey I that was phenomenal I'm like actually disappointed in you a little bit I know it's unfair but it's like I actually am hurt that was wonderful I'm that was awesome guys that was actually phenomenal like you guys did a fucking hell of a job thank you thank you uh which I and you guys I you guys were locked in that's what was going on over here okay
[134:25.37]For context for everybody, Jerma did pop in at the very beginning, and we asked what his biggest fear is, and he said, cockroaches.
[134:31.84]And then, no, no, no, you started and you said, it's letting down the people I love.
[134:35.40]And then you were like, oh, and you honked your clown nose, and you were like, cockroaches.
[134:38.69]We were like, oh, okay.
[134:40.41]So you made an entire, so a quick question.
[134:44.87]The slot machines, was that all custom content?
[134:48.73]The only custom content was the roulette table.
[134:52.85]Oh, okay.
[134:54.27]I thought you guys built those with like walls or something.
[134:56.75]That was crazy.
[134:57.52]Oh, no.
[134:57.82]They were just arcade machines.
[134:59.92]Yeah.
[135:01.30]Well, awesome, guys.
[135:03.44]We got two more to do.
[135:04.86]That was Doug, Doug, Stans, and Andre.
[135:08.01]Excellent work.
[135:09.45]We're going to move on.
[135:11.41]I'm excited to see your guys' houses.
[135:13.47]Yeah.
[135:13.61]Same deal as I'm going to make a new game.
[135:20.30]And we are going to get, let's get, who's down there?
[135:24.74]I kind of did this out of order, but it's alright.
[135:27.19]Let's get, let's get Limes, RT, and Kryken in here.
[135:32.82]Give us one second.
[135:34.52]Hang on.
[135:37.38]What?
[135:38.12]Are we going to be in the game as well?
[135:39.69]Like all of us?
[135:40.35]You will be.
[135:41.31]Okay, okay.
[135:42.19]Let me see stream sniping you.
[135:44.83]One sec.
[135:45.29]Okay.
[135:46.15]You won't be able to see any custom content, but you will be able to.
[135:49.60]Oh, that's a good question for Nandre.
[135:52.04]Nandre, could you see the roulette table?
[135:54.36]Yeah, it works.
[135:55.20]Okay, so the host can.
[135:56.31]The host should be able to see it as well.
[135:58.61]Very good.
[135:59.67]I could not, so the other folks won't, but the host can.
[136:02.37]Yeah, I couldn't see anything.
[136:03.24]Just look normally.
[136:05.30]I have to guide you through the custom content.
[136:12.79]I use the code here.
[136:15.31]I will have to be the one that hosts.
[136:18.88]Yeah.
[136:19.16]Are you cross-platform on or off?
[136:20.94]Cross-platform off.
[136:21.98]I'm just loading the house up right now.
[136:24.22]Okay.
[136:27.93]I see it there.
[136:28.65]Momentarily.
[136:30.89]Yep.
[136:32.78]I'm going to drop the code.
[136:37.10]Well, that was a great start.
[136:39.63]Yeah, that was awesome.
[136:40.15]I'm surprised.
[136:40.63]That was fucking awesome.
[136:43.10]Code is in the chat.
[136:47.37]Which chat?
[136:48.53]The general living room chat.
[136:50.88]Okay.
[136:54.54]Hiding code.
[136:57.03]Yeah, the code will be on the screen, so be aware.
[136:59.49]Oh, the host does not allow for cross-platform.
[137:01.61]Oh, yeah, no, no.
[137:02.11]You've got to change it, so turn off cross-platform.
[137:04.38]Yeah, you have to hit the button.
[137:07.16]Thank you.
[137:08.51]Looks like we're all in.
[137:11.49]I love just four people with their hands on their hips like, let's do it, gang.
[137:15.59]Let's build this house.
[137:16.70]Let's flip it.
[137:17.60]Okay, I'm opening your level right now.
[137:22.34]And should I just look down?
[137:23.71]I wonder where I'm going to be.
[137:25.49]Yeah, I don't know.
[137:26.29]I think you'll be near the entrance.
[137:27.51]I don't know where you're going to start, no.
[137:28.99]Yeah, well, just make sure that you're at the entrance of the fucking house.
[137:32.02]Okay.
[137:32.32]That's the main thing.
[137:33.62]Let me make sure I can hear everybody loud and clear.
[137:42.86]Okay.
[137:45.48]I should be able to hear everybody loud and clear.
[137:49.15]Okay.
[137:49.31]I'm going to look down and let's get the game up.
[137:53.77]I can see.
[137:54.76]Yeah, that looks good.
[137:58.00]Okay.
[137:58.96]Let me preface.
[137:59.66]I hope this is brand friendly.
[138:02.85]I hope this is going to be a brand friendly house.
[138:04.85]Oh, it's not going to be like last time.
[138:06.05]Don't worry.
[138:08.04]Wait, they got to use the Scooby-Doo DLC?
[138:09.54]Yeah.
[138:10.34]Doug, Doug, I am so glad you said that.
[138:11.88]We got early access.
[138:14.32]Scooby-Doo.
[138:15.06]I'm walking.
[138:15.87]Is coming soon to House Flipper 2.
[138:19.53]There's going to be Scooby-Doo DLC.
[138:22.45]I got an idea.
[138:25.10]That's right, Jerma, and we built the first ever episode of Scooby-Doo.
[138:30.10]Starring your favorite streamer, Jerma985.
[138:34.15]Okay.
[138:36.07]To begin with, take a look at your feet.
[138:37.65]The gang arrived at the haunted mansion.
[138:41.67]The haunted player mansion, actually.
[138:48.98]I'm sorry.
[138:49.76]I'm sorry.
[138:51.02]I'm ready.
[138:53.09]Great.
[138:54.33]As Jeremy was composing himself, the gang scrambled ahead into the house and they went missing.
[139:01.34]Oh, let's split up and search for clues, gang, immediately.
[139:05.25]That's right.
[139:06.07]Okay, search for clues.
[139:07.05]You got it.
[139:08.19]Welcome to the Scooby-Doo Project.
[139:10.12]Your mission is to find each of the mystery gang.
[139:13.92]But beware, there may be some ghouls and goblins in this house.
[139:19.07]Such as... Various other nightmare atrocities.
[139:23.26]The hat one.
[139:25.34]The zombie one.
[139:30.47]Are they in the house?
[139:31.99]Or is this the room showing me what could be here?
[139:34.71]Or are they in here?
[139:36.37]I'm not going to tell.
[139:37.39]You have to watch the episode to find out.
[139:39.67]Now, lead the way, Jerma.
[139:41.27]Let's see if we can locate the gang before they get mauled horribly by the monsters.
[139:44.96]Okay, stick with me.
[139:47.42]Let me take a look.
[139:49.36]Well, there's a typewriter here.
[139:50.80]That must mean they must be a novelist.
[139:53.81]Also, I see two candles, not more than two.
[139:57.07]There's only two monsters in this house.
[139:58.67]Otherwise it'd be three or four.
[140:00.35]I see three candles, but you know.
[140:04.64]I'm the detective.
[140:06.38]Yes, sir.
[140:07.12]Oh, pizza.
[140:07.92]That's a clue.
[140:08.98]That means they love pizza.
[140:11.28]Watch your step.
[140:11.93]Watch your step.
[140:12.81]Yep.
[140:14.03]There is a Lego brick on the staircase.
[140:16.55]Oh, whoa.
[140:17.67]Please proceed with caution.
[140:19.91]Those dastardly monsters.
[140:21.75]Holy shit.
[140:23.36]Okay.
[140:23.82]Oh, I just saw the gang.
[140:25.26]They went from room to room based on this picture.
[140:27.96]That classic gag where they're running to rooms around us.
[140:30.77]Oh, yeah, I just missed them.
[140:32.91]Yeah, we just missed them.
[140:34.03]This is gone now.
[140:35.83]Oh, dude, I thought I saw, I think I saw Fred go this way.
[140:38.94]Yeah?
[140:39.36]Okay, lead the way.
[140:42.08]What the?
[140:42.86]This is beautiful.
[140:44.96]Oh, no, Fred went into the Twilight dreamscape.
[140:48.67]Oh, this seems to be some sort of Twilight dreamscape.
[140:51.55]It is a Twilight dreamscape, and it is gorgeous, by the way.
[140:55.32]Can I just make that clear?
[140:56.32]Whoever the monster is, you've got taste.
[140:58.22]I think he's lost on the other side of the mirror world.
[141:00.86]You can see the lights.
[141:02.01]One of them might be his soul.
[141:04.21]It's reflections in the sky.
[141:06.13]Could this be the souls of the gang?
[141:08.09]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[141:10.50]Fred, Velma, Daphne, Scooby, Shaggy.
[141:15.10]Scrappy.
[141:16.34]We're including Scrappy in this?
[141:18.52]We're including Scrappy, yeah.
[141:20.35]Okay, alright.
[141:22.86]Okay.
[141:24.20]Well, lead the way.
[141:25.18]You got to find the rest of them.
[141:26.22]I'm going to say... What's this?
[141:29.42]Choose your door carefully.
[141:30.34]Milk.
[141:30.79]Oh, no.
[141:31.37]You picked the lactose intolerant room.
[141:33.61]Get out.
[141:34.11]No, it's too scary.
[141:35.31]You don't want to be in this one.
[141:36.25]There's milk in that room.
[141:37.77]Yeah.
[141:37.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[141:39.55]This one.
[141:39.75]Be careful.
[141:40.33]Be careful.
[141:41.26]Whoa.
[141:42.62]It's a trap door.
[141:44.36]It's the reference to the Winchester house.
[141:46.08]You got to be careful.
[141:47.58]No.
[141:48.02]I found Daphne.
[141:50.58]Looks like you found Daphne.
[141:51.44]Oh, Daphne must be dead.
[141:52.63]Seems like she fell out of the trapdoor and broke her legs.
[141:55.75]No!
[141:56.39]Oh, no, they got Daphne.
[141:57.37]But she will make a swift recovery fully.
[142:00.82]That's right.
[142:01.38]Let's get her back to the mystery gang where we have first aid kit.
[142:04.35]I think she slipped on this Lego block that was here.
[142:06.73]That's very unfortunate.
[142:07.57]She slipped on this Lego.
[142:08.73]Yeah, no, that did her in.
[142:09.75]That must have been it.
[142:10.42]Oh, God.
[142:10.96]That's very dangerous.
[142:11.90]Oh, I fell.
[142:13.88]I fell.
[142:15.24]Help, help.
[142:16.10]I don't want to break my legs.
[142:18.85]Does anyone have eyes on Trevor?
[142:20.59]I don't know where he fell.
[142:22.03]Alright.
[142:22.54]I'm going to say... That's another reference to the Winchester house.
[142:32.41]You've got to be careful.
[142:33.51]It's another trap door.
[142:34.84]They really thought of everything here.
[142:36.34]Is Fred down here?
[142:38.04]No, Fred's not down there.
[142:39.55]They wouldn't use the same gag twice.
[142:41.03]What do you think the monster is?
[142:44.95]What about this one?
[142:45.76]Oh, no.
[142:46.12]It's a third reference to the Winchester house.
[142:49.06]Oh, no.
[142:49.58]If I fell down, that would be terrible.
[142:52.38]Yeah.
[142:52.74]Maybe let's try one of the other rooms.
[142:54.13]Oh, let's try this one.
[142:57.13]Oh, back to the foyer.
[142:57.89]This is where we came in.
[142:58.59]Okay.
[142:59.67]Alright.
[143:00.30]That was terrifying.
[143:01.82]There's something scary above the doorway.
[143:03.58]Do you see that?
[143:04.66]What's that?
[143:05.58]Oh, my God.
[143:06.28]It's an omen from the monster.
[143:10.82]Is this an omen?
[143:13.27]Live, laugh, love is the omen?
[143:15.55]All the things you're supposed to do during an episode of Scooby-Doo.
[143:18.65]Coming to House Flipper 2.
[143:22.33]God damn it.
[143:26.24]You do the guy in between commercials routine.
[143:30.52]I love it.
[143:31.58]Thanks, man.
[143:32.00]Hey, guys!
[143:33.81]Hey, gang!
[143:35.55]A clue!
[143:36.31]I found something!
[143:38.40]Oh my God.
[143:39.26]Alligators.
[143:40.52]Is this the reptile room?
[143:43.31]Reptile room.
[143:44.15]Surely someone must be hiding in the reptile room.
[143:46.19]Is somebody in here?
[143:47.05]I don't know.
[143:48.45]Let's take, let's take a look.
[143:49.81]Fred.
[143:51.20]Fred.
[143:51.88]Fred.
[143:53.58]There he is.
[143:54.12]Fred.
[143:55.76]Hey, come with us.
[143:57.51]Come with us, dude.
[143:58.31]This place is crazy.
[143:59.37]We got to get you out of here, Fred.
[144:01.37]Grab Fred quick.
[144:02.11]Looks like he found some sort of dead animal.
[144:04.98]Some carcass in the woods.
[144:07.81]Fred's getting out of here.
[144:11.96]No, Fred doesn't go on the ceiling.
[144:13.80]Alright, put him back to the van.
[144:16.86]Alright, we got Fred and we got Daphne.
[144:18.76]They're both... They're fine.
[144:21.09]They're fine.
[144:21.55]They're fine.
[144:22.21]Fred was raking leaves.
[144:23.63]Fred's raking leaves in that van.
[144:25.93]I think Shaggy may have been nearby because of all the pizza boxes.
[144:28.52]I do see that.
[144:29.38]Yeah, let me see.
[144:32.24]Pizza... Is Shaggy in the alligator room too eating a bunch of pizza?
[144:39.97]And by the way, where there's Shaggy, you know that there's gonna be Ruby.
[144:46.89]That's right, Jerma.
[144:48.45]Ruby and Shaggy are rarely far apart.
[144:50.97]Unless they're told to split up by Fred.
[144:56.32]Okay, I see.
[144:57.08]Uh-oh.
[145:01.57]More pizza.
[145:02.59]Pizza boxes.
[145:03.35]They must have been through here.
[145:05.62]What does that mean?
[145:06.27]Shaggy really destroyed this place.
[145:08.65]Who is reading Shaggy?
[145:09.99]Imagine reading a book called fucking space with no author.
[145:15.70]Hmm.
[145:15.80]Which of the gang loves space?
[145:17.42]Maybe it's another clue.
[145:21.51]Hmm.
[145:21.61]Wait a minute.
[145:22.65]There's a lot in here.
[145:23.61]Holy shit.
[145:24.65]I found I found it's haggard.
[145:27.05]I don't.
[145:27.74]OK.
[145:28.62]From the Lord of the Rings.
[145:31.02]Hagrid from Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.
[145:33.44]He's in all of them.
[145:37.83]I think Hagrid might have some... He found the Hagrid corner.
[145:43.44]Hagrid gives you one hint if you ask him nicely.
[145:47.28]Hey, Hagrid.
[145:49.48]I'm sorry.
[145:50.44]I would love a clue as to... Can I get one hint?
[145:54.43]Yeah.
[145:55.35]Scooby-doo in hell.
[145:59.12]But not like Elmo hell.
[146:01.74]Like a more traditional biblical hell.
[146:05.57]Hagrid just wants to check if he heard the good word of the Lord.
[146:12.22]Thanks for the hint.
[146:14.02]There's a little narrative over here.
[146:15.90]I think Hagrid has blood in his hands because there's an empty baby crib.
[146:18.99]And if you check here, there's a book that says nap in a sun patch.
[146:22.51]We have some sunflowers, but the child is missing.
[146:25.34]This wolf could be a clue as to what happened to the poor child.
[146:30.00]Sunflowers.
[146:31.36]Wolf.
[146:31.48]There's a bit of environmental storytelling there, like most Scooby-Doo episodes.
[146:35.00]He was eaten in the sunflower patch outside by a wolf.
[146:39.49]Ding, ding, ding, ding!
[146:40.41]Let's go.
[146:41.37]You got it right.
[146:42.67]Kang is going to find a dead baby later.
[146:46.64]Oh, okay.
[146:47.08]We're leaving the house.
[146:48.00]I think he's looking for the baby.
[146:50.20]He's looking for the wolf.
[146:51.44]Whoa, this is beautiful.
[146:52.74]Whoa, a skeleton.
[146:54.04]This is gorgeous.
[146:54.88]Is this the skeleton of some sort of child that was eaten by a wolf?
[147:00.14]I wonder, did he fall down the well?
[147:02.46]Hey, watch your step.
[147:08.76]Okay.
[147:10.39]Alright, Limes, you just told me about this.
[147:13.01]You literally were talking about this.
[147:14.84]You were talking about the ring book.
[147:19.73]Well, it looks like Velma fell down the ring well, and now she's also in the ring movie as Samara.
[147:28.00]It's kind of a meeting of the worlds in this episode.
[147:31.37]We'll check in with her in seven days.
[147:33.33]What a crazy... That's wild.
[147:37.76]There's a TV down here as well.
[147:39.30]Okay.
[147:41.06]I need some help getting out.
[147:42.84]If you want to get me out.
[147:44.38]casts levitation on you.
[147:46.79]In this episode, the gang learns how to levitate to get out of the ring well.
[147:50.36]Okay.
[147:51.02]I still haven't found Scooby.
[147:53.58]Or Shaggy.
[147:55.07]I know.
[147:55.39]Where are they?
[147:56.01]I'll go back to the pizza room.
[147:56.97]Wait.
[147:57.39]What about back here?
[148:01.00]I want to check the whole room.
[148:02.44]Check the whole house.
[148:07.77]Something going on in there.
[148:10.58]Maybe we should enter that room from the front door.
[148:12.84]We should go this way.
[148:16.26]We should probably go this way.
[148:18.70]Okay, we're going to go this way.
[148:20.22]Can I just say, what an outdoor landscaping job this is.
[148:26.97]This is the best I think I've ever seen.
[148:29.97]I practiced.
[148:30.81]That's phenomenal.
[148:34.56]Thank you.
[148:35.26]Okay, what about over here?
[148:39.04]I'll be careful.
[148:40.04]I gotta pick one, right?
[148:41.41]Can you find the right way forward?
[148:43.45]The wrong way may spell your doom.
[148:48.53]That's a candle.
[148:52.18]It's okay.
[148:52.82]He'll get a handle on it eventually.
[148:55.96]This one?
[148:59.65]Broken window.
[149:00.23]Broken window.
[149:01.51]Somebody try to escape?
[149:02.53]Or get in.
[149:04.95]Oh, shoot.
[149:06.11]That's true.
[149:12.61]He loves the candles.
[149:14.09]He really loves the candles.
[149:15.39]Another door.
[149:17.07]Hmm.
[149:18.53]Wait, I see a look.
[149:19.68]Watch out.
[149:20.44]Watch your step.
[149:21.04]Watch your step.
[149:21.98]You could have warned me before I walked in.
[149:24.02]That's how Daphne died.
[149:25.38]Be very careful.
[149:29.07]Okay, another.
[149:30.41]I'm going to say left side.
[149:32.51]I found him.
[149:35.88]There he is.
[149:36.36]You found Shaggy Blair witching in the corner of the bathroom.
[149:40.30]Great job.
[149:43.03]What is he seeing?
[149:43.85]Is he okay?
[149:44.89]And where is Scooby Dooby Doo?
[149:49.06]Alright, Shaggy, come on.
[149:50.34]Let's go.
[149:53.50]Careful of the horrors of this room as there's carpet in this toilet.
[149:58.61]Very scary.
[150:00.21]We got Shaggy, Daphne, Fred, and Velma.
[150:04.05]It's just Scooby that's left.
[150:06.09]Yeah.
[150:07.50]It's definitely in that other room.
[150:10.10]Wait, let me explore this.
[150:14.47]Okay.
[150:15.33]This one.
[150:16.83]That's nothing.
[150:17.47]Okay, but that door leads me.
[150:19.38]Jerma runs into a wall.
[150:21.82]And it makes a bunch of cartoon sounds and he's got to unflatten himself.
[150:25.91]He's 2D.
[150:28.83]He's back at the candle again.
[150:29.95]He loves that candle.
[150:32.70]Okay.
[150:34.40]So how do I get to the room that I saw up here?
[150:38.04]The pizza boxes.
[150:40.43]Wait, no.
[150:41.65]Pizza boxes, that must be a clue.
[150:43.09]Definitely pizza boxes and definitely a way to go down from here.
[150:49.67]Maybe there's a different clue Jerma hasn't seen in this room downstairs.
[150:56.88]I've just seen that.
[150:57.38]Get out of the fucking way.
[150:59.06]I'm stuck in the alligator room.
[151:01.02]You don't want to get stuck in the alligator room.
[151:05.35]Did I miss a clue?
[151:08.11]You're supposed to do germospheres, not mine.
[151:11.00]Whoa, there's something in here.
[151:13.02]You found Scrappy as well.
[151:19.87]We forgot about him.
[151:22.05]You didn't even notice he was there.
[151:23.51]I didn't notice he was there.
[151:26.78]Alright, so he seems like he's okay.
[151:27.72]I guess he technically counts.
[151:29.33]Oh, you want to leave him here?
[151:30.73]I mean, he seems happy.
[151:31.83]He does not seem scared or kind of... Yeah, that's just Scrappy's demeanor.
[151:36.12]Yeah, he's just... He's got a trampoline, so he's alright.
[151:39.02]I think he'll be fine.
[151:40.43]We're leaving Scrappy in the mansion?
[151:41.69]I think we're going to leave Scrappy.
[151:42.83]I think he's happy.
[151:44.25]Watch out!
[151:44.95]You almost stepped on a Lego.
[151:46.29]You just dodged it.
[151:47.36]Please be careful.
[151:48.84]I'm trying to be careful.
[151:50.36]We can't have any more blood in our hands.
[151:52.28]The final room.
[151:53.79]Oh!
[151:54.81]You entered the nine and a half minute hallway from House of Leaves.
[151:59.10]Oh, my goodness.
[152:00.66]Popular postmodern literary reference.
[152:02.54]What's wrong, Scoob?
[152:04.76]His eyes have rolled behind his head.
[152:06.72]It looks like he's peeped some kind of horror in the other room.
[152:10.55]Oh, my God.
[152:11.61]This is actually moving.
[152:13.11]Did you put a gif?
[152:16.07]How did you do this?
[152:16.49]One of the materials is lava, it turns out.
[152:19.72]It seems Scooby-Doo peeped the horror, and now he's lost his mind.
[152:26.33]With a lot of remote control changers.
[152:30.52]Which one powers the TV?
[152:32.44]This truly is hell.
[152:33.90]You'll never know until you try them all.
[152:37.71]I'll try this one.
[152:40.51]Oh, you found it.
[152:41.29]Oh, wow.
[152:41.85]Yep, first try.
[152:44.10]That took 40 minutes to set up.
[152:45.76]And so you've solved the puzzle of the Scooby-Doo Haunted Mansion and saved the mystery gang.
[152:52.23]Except for Scrappy.
[152:53.03]He's sticking around.
[152:54.21]Yeah, he can stick around.
[152:56.93]What?
[152:57.19]There's another room.
[152:58.82]What's this?
[152:59.10]What's this?
[153:02.29]I didn't even know we had this room.
[153:05.86]Welcome to the storage facility.
[153:08.14]This is Dev Island.
[153:11.34]Yeah, this is where we stored all the paper cutouts of the monsters and all their masks and stuff we kept back here.
[153:16.83]And the Lego blocks.
[153:18.15]There's one right there.
[153:20.12]Please be careful.
[153:21.96]I love it.
[153:22.92]This is great.
[153:24.42]This was cute, fun, funny, wild, on brand, by the way, extra points.
[153:35.62]That was phenomenal.
[153:37.98]Let me just see the outside.
[153:41.87]Because the actual curbside here was crazy looking.
[153:47.18]Look at this.
[153:48.38]Look at this.
[153:48.72]This is a real build.
[153:50.40]Look at how real this build is.
[153:52.68]Not to say the other ones were not, but look at this.
[153:55.05]This is a roof job.
[153:57.85]Look at this.
[153:58.79]Look at this.
[154:00.36]What's it called?
[154:01.12]Crown?
[154:01.88]Whatever?
[154:02.38]Crown shit on this?
[154:03.22]What is that called?
[154:04.68]Like crown molding?
[154:05.64]Yes, look at that.
[154:07.80]Thank you.
[154:08.22]It took so much work to get the house shape.

[156:42.85]I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
[156:44.71]You don't have to eliminate two teams.
[156:46.83]It's so scary to say that before you've even seen our house, though.
[156:50.10]That's true.
[156:50.66]It sounds like you're already like, I've got to vote two people off.

[158:28.83]You're good if you look this way, and there's a start, and we'll just start at the beginning.
[158:31.92]You can't even read that it says start.

[159:14.08]So there you go.
[159:15.30]Does me go?
[159:17.04]I don't know that we're all- Just for the beginning, just for the first part.
[159:20.37]Hey, welcome.
[159:21.67]So we're opening this new, we're not really sure, we're calling it an experience.
[159:25.48]So you booked this online, I'm assuming, and you wanted to like, I don't know, spend a night and have an experience, right?
[159:31.05]Yeah, I booked it.
[159:32.43]You drove down the road this way and you're just, you're finally ready to like pull in.
[159:37.20]We have a full parking lot, but it starts to get a little bit spooky.
[159:43.21]This is so loud.
[159:43.89]You start to get a little bit concerned.
[159:45.66]Is it loud?
[159:48.48]But it worked.
[159:49.02]It worked.
[159:49.36]Okay.
[159:49.85]Things got a little scary as I pulled in, I'm noticing.
[159:53.07]Yeah.
[159:53.63]There's some signs for no parking and...
[159:56.52]You don't know where to park, but it's good because I think you walked.
[159:59.65]Yeah, okay.
[160:00.89]People don't really drive around here.
[160:02.65]I'm gonna park right here.
[160:04.27]People don't really drive their cars around here.
[160:06.58]Why does that building have your name on it?
[160:09.00]They usually stop by and just keep moving.
[160:11.50]Yeah, that's weird.
[160:12.69]I thought this was just an attraction.
[160:14.99]There's stories about this man's house.
[160:17.91]Hey, guys.
[160:19.39]Hey, thanks for coming to my internet post.
[160:23.22]Yeah, we found this weird place online.
[160:25.43]And, uh, I don't know if I've just been, uh, you guys can hear me, right?
[160:29.81]Yeah.
[160:30.80]Alright.
[160:31.04]So I have to be this tall to ride it.
[160:33.28]That's a handsome, by the way, the perspective of this photo is fucked up.
[160:36.76]This photo, the person took the photo, holding it in the air like this with a wide angle lens on it.
[160:42.91]That's why I'm like five, seven and a half, five, nine.
[160:46.73]This photo was, it was a fucked up angle.
[160:48.31]Okay.
[160:50.90]Before we go in the house, should I fix anything?
[160:54.91]Should you fix anything?
[160:56.17]Scary.
[160:56.61]My audio.
[160:57.79]Oh, I thought you were in the experience.
[161:00.12]Dara, play the music.
[161:00.90]It's you now.
[161:02.10]Alright, welcome.
[161:03.34]Alright, I'm here.
[161:04.86]Well, you have to get in line.
[161:06.22]The first scary thing here is you have to absolutely, we're going to be doing a whole queue system if you want to get in.
[161:11.75]Yeah.
[161:12.39]Hold on.
[161:12.77]Oh, I got priority.
[161:13.69]Excuse me.
[161:14.45]Excuse me.
[161:14.83]Sorry.
[161:15.21]I paid ahead of time for it.
[161:16.65]Yeah, actually, I did online as well.
[161:18.78]You have to get the fast pass.
[161:20.42]Okay, well, let's go through.
[161:22.08]No, stay away.
[161:23.34]Turn back.
[161:24.76]Don't, don't you see?
[161:26.06]Have you heard my take on that?
[161:27.95]How there's a guy outside of all these experiences saying that, and we just line up in front of this and don't give a fuck about what this guy says.
[161:34.88]We are mocking the guy up there.
[161:36.94]No, adventurers, don't you understand?
[161:39.20]It's so dangerous.
[161:40.62]We've put a cue in front of this guy to mock him at how much we don't care.
[161:46.57]You are on camera right now as well.
[161:49.07]Just to be clear.
[161:50.91]Should I not be on camera?
[161:52.99]No, I mean like this place is monitored.
[161:54.72]Here, you're on camera.
[161:56.04]There's a couple of signs.
[161:57.48]Oh, okay.
[161:58.16]Sure.
[161:59.28]But whenever you're ready to open the, you know, get into the experience, you might open up the front door.
[162:03.27]Okay.
[162:04.87]I paid a lot of money for this.
[162:05.83]This was $85.
[162:06.79]Welcome.
[162:09.17]Come in.
[162:14.38]Did we get you?
[162:15.44]Yeah.
[162:15.84]No.
[162:17.95]That's all we had.
[162:19.15]We couldn't figure out.
[162:19.97]That was the experience.
[162:21.83]That was actually it.
[162:23.55]Wait, what?
[162:25.06]No, it's not.
[162:26.06]We had a hard time building this.
[162:28.84]That's literally all we made.
[162:30.20]Snuffy's computer was, like, frozen.
[162:31.96]Come on.
[162:32.97]Alright, wait, what if we do some... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[162:35.43]Stay right here.
[162:35.89]Stay right here.
[162:36.37]Stay right here.
[162:37.75]No, no, stay right there.
[162:39.03]Okay, now hold on.
[162:40.80]We couldn't really do it.
[162:41.64]Oh, stop.
[162:47.25]Did that get you?
[162:51.37]No, because it's like a pole closet.
[162:53.42]This is not scary.
[162:55.38]By the way, it's the default white color pole closet.
[162:58.83]I have one of these behind me.
[163:00.07]It's not scary.
[163:01.31]Oh, you have one of these?
[163:02.29]Isn't that interesting?
[163:03.11]Because this is a streamer's room.
[163:06.04]Whoa, wait a second.
[163:07.64]When was this made?
[163:09.50]I don't know.
[163:10.12]We didn't do this.
[163:11.26]Wait, who did this?
[163:12.83]Where's the experience?
[163:14.69]Wait, you guys actually made stuff?
[163:16.51]What the?
[163:17.33]I didn't make this.
[163:18.35]Dude, sick scooter in here.
[163:20.09]And I love the color scheme of this scooter, by the way.
[163:24.92]Did you load the wrong file?
[163:27.97]Is this your bat?
[163:29.39]You got anger issues?
[163:30.71]Yeah, it's just covered in alcohol.
[163:33.86]Is this your room, Jerma?
[163:36.47]No, this is not my room.
[163:38.46]These would be coffees.
[163:40.24]What's with the razor blade, dude?
[163:42.47]I don't know.
[163:43.09]I don't know.
[163:43.73]I can't hear a sound.
[163:46.06]So much shattered bottles and corn.
[163:49.47]There's a door in the back.
[163:52.01]Dude, you know, if this was my room, I'd be so psyched because, like, damn, man.
[163:57.20]How far away the TV is.
[163:59.90]Yeah.
[164:00.04]You can't see it from literally laying in the bed.
[164:03.65]I feel like this is something you would see in a dream, man.
[164:06.67]It's crazy.
[164:07.13]Is anyone playing music for him?
[164:10.10]Did we get you?
[164:11.78]I hear music.
[164:13.36]No.
[164:15.18]Okay.
[164:16.77]Okay, we made it through this way.
[164:18.73]If you're pissing your pants now, then you're gonna need to use the restroom.
[164:21.85]You will be monitored.
[164:25.33]Wait, guys, who made this?
[164:28.92]Did he load the wrong file?
[164:30.36]Oh, this is cursed.
[164:32.24]We didn't do any of this.
[164:33.94]You wouldn't use this bathroom.
[164:36.21]Are you gonna use this bathroom seeing this shit up here?
[164:39.92]That's so fucked up.
[164:42.25]Okay.
[164:43.45]Can you open this YouTube file before you move forward?
[164:46.36]Open this YouTube file?
[164:48.24]Yeah, can you open this link?
[164:50.71]Yeah, can you press play on this?
[164:51.95]Yeah, I'll press play on it.
[164:54.37]Okay, I'll link it.
[164:55.62]Link it to me?
[164:56.08]Okay.

[165:49.32]The $85 is now.
[165:52.18]Star, I got this right here.
[165:54.47]Welcome to your biggest fear.
[165:59.07]We did some analysis on you.
[166:01.75]The other guys did some analysis on you.
[166:03.39]Casino?
[166:05.17]Gambling?
[166:06.62]No, we really know what you're scared of.
[166:08.98]We really know what you're scared of.
[166:10.94]Why don't you come behind me and figure it out yourself?
[166:18.39]Yo, Snuffy, you gotta stop.
[166:23.29]It's me.
[166:33.83]Okay.
[166:33.95]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[166:35.45]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[166:41.56]This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[166:44.30]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term.
[166:47.23]Pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[166:50.45]You're going to see lots of fails.
[166:51.59]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[166:53.48]This is one of your guys' search history.
[166:55.26]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[166:57.00]Because House Flipper 2 custom radio?
[166:59.12]I didn't search that.
[167:03.53]This is terrifying.
[167:07.74]Horrifying.
[167:08.26]You're being watched at all times.
[167:10.90]You ever feel like you're just being watched at all times?
[167:13.94]You ever feel like that?
[167:15.41]Yeah.
[167:16.35]Like right now.

[167:59.88]What the fuck?
[168:00.40]His dick is on stream.

[168:06.09]Dude, hey, your cock is out.
[168:10.65]Dude, this is crazy.
[168:16.53]Your worst nightmare is realized.
[168:21.20]Yo, repeat the video.
[168:23.84]Oh.
[168:24.34]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to... No, no, the piglet one.
[168:27.28]Oh, I got it, yeah.
[168:29.09]Okay, piglet.
[168:33.11]Yeah, you're gonna... The ambience is important.
[168:34.75]Is this like Deadpool?
[168:38.80]It's all of your angry viewers.
[168:42.07]They're watching and they're so mad.
[168:43.49]So have we struck into your deepest fears?
[168:48.12]Yeah, pretty much.
[168:50.64]Being naked on stream is number one, apparently.
[168:56.79]It gets worse.
[168:57.81]It gets worse?
[168:59.01]Do you think it couldn't get any worse?
[169:00.71]It gets worse.
[169:03.04]Right now, what's the worst thing that somebody could ever say to you?
[169:06.72]Uh... I don't know.
[169:11.50]I think I'm gonna find out.
[169:20.95]-2.
[169:29.56]No, no, no, no, no!
[169:33.61]No!
[169:37.43]I...
[169:46.61]Ignore that they have snuffy sub-batches.
[169:59.33]They don't even have my sub-batches.
[170:01.19]This is a different chat.
[170:01.89]This was from that time we did the cross-chat experiment, remember?
[170:07.44]That honestly adds a layer to me.
[170:11.52]Now I know where you got the chat.
[170:13.55]That's fucking awesome.
[170:15.79]Okay, that would be scary.
[170:17.67]Yeah, that would be bad.
[170:24.02]Where did you get this picture?
[170:27.22]Where did you get this photo?
[170:28.86]Where did you get this photo?
[170:30.00]I'm serious.
[170:31.58]I'm serious.
[170:33.05]Where is there a guitar?
[170:35.07]I don't have a guitar.
[170:45.97]How did you get this photo of this fucking probably AI-generated photo of, like, man with blue shirt on?
[170:55.47]We got a guy on the inside.
[170:56.71]I love this.
[170:59.15]Dude, I don't even sit up straight like that.
[171:03.02]That's the biggest giveaway.
[171:06.90]What am I looking at?
[171:07.92]Am I watching me doing this?
[171:11.19]Okay, that's scary.
[171:12.41]That is very scary.
[171:14.21]Whoa, dude.
[171:20.15]Okay, that is a very off-putting photos.
[171:26.01]Do you remember these days?
[171:27.50]Do you remember this day?
[171:28.62]Who is that?
[171:30.74]Replay the video.
[171:33.08]Oh, the video stopped.
[171:38.67]I do.
[171:39.07]It's almost like an animation.
[171:40.11]Look.
[171:42.03]Whoa.
[171:43.11]Did you guys think of that?
[171:45.58]Yes.
[171:46.48]Yeah.
[171:47.54]Okay.
[171:49.36]I think I'm ready to move on.
[171:53.28]Is there another room?
[171:55.65]That's it.
[171:56.71]Press pause.
[171:58.91]You close it.
[171:59.79]Piglet's over.
[172:03.90]This picture is so stupid.
[172:08.52]You guys look over here.
[172:11.07]Turn around.
[172:13.79]The scariest one of them all.
[172:17.20]Over here.
[172:21.45]yeah you had a weird you had a weird phase apparently this guy sent us the photo of your head by the way
[172:48.74]Is this the guy who snapped that pic of you behind without you looking too?
[172:53.69]This is at like a convention somewhere.
[172:57.07]This is like a, yo, just pulled up to the con.
[173:00.96]Oh, it's empty too.
[173:01.96]There's nobody here.
[173:02.78]What con is this, man?
[173:04.12]Like there ain't nobody here.
[173:05.16]Are you here three days before the con?
[173:07.57]You're actually just loitering out of like a bank building.
[173:10.31]Yeah, it's not even like a con.
[173:13.43]Oh, my God.
[173:14.41]You guys are fucking crazy.
[173:15.95]I love it.
[173:16.39]This has been the delving of the many layers of your nightmare.
[173:21.50]Poke, you used this picture last time.
[173:23.86]I noticed you put it over here.
[173:26.29]Bro, it's... Like, that's not part of the experience.
[173:33.58]I didn't even know I put that one there.
[173:35.40]I swear to God.
[173:38.40]How did you get these to be so small?
[173:41.47]I have a decision to make, and I don't fucking know.
[173:54.41]Honest to God, I don't.
[173:57.75]That was wonderful.
[173:59.57]Amazing job, as always, guys.
[174:02.68]Let me take a look at the roof.
[174:07.31]I have to declare a winner, though.
[174:08.75]I think the roof took 40 minutes.
[174:11.20]It's not even good.
[174:13.90]It's not even good.
[174:14.62]No, it actually looks great.
[174:16.75]Look at the way it actually just layers into itself like this healthily.
[174:20.61]I've remade it three times.
[174:22.33]Surprisingly cohesive.
[174:23.86]It doesn't have crown molding like Team 2, but...
[174:28.10]It's okay.
[174:30.68]Okay.
[174:31.73]All of you can... I think everyone's up here.
[174:35.37]Thank you for participating in this whole thing.
[174:37.89]I know we had to do it over a couple days.
[174:40.06]And I know that timing, it takes a long time.
[174:42.74]It's a long event.
[174:44.20]But we have come to what is the conclusion.
[174:48.27]I have to decide who wins.
[174:50.39]And it's going to be very, very difficult.
[174:52.37]I think all three of them, I loved them all for different reasons.
[175:04.09]Yeah, mommy's deciding now.
[175:05.86]Doug Doug's and Andre's and Stan's house was fucking crazy.
[175:12.98]That was crazy.
[175:14.91]Crazy, crazy, crazy.
[175:16.83]And they're a top contender for sure.
[175:21.72]I was going to say.
[175:22.22]Top three for sure.
[175:23.62]That's top three for sure.
[175:25.24]Yeah!
[175:27.70]I think it's coming down to the casino for me.
[175:32.09]And
[175:37.98]Yeah, it's a tough choice between those other two.
[175:39.76]And the other two.
[175:40.93]I know.
[175:42.07]I'm leaning.
[175:42.85]Right now, I'm leaning towards Casino.
[175:44.67]I'll be honest.
[175:45.91]Hey, say less, King.
[175:47.34]It was just so much.
[175:49.82]The theming, right?
[175:51.08]I know, like, haunted manor, haunted manor.
[175:55.63]But the Scooby-Doo shit was funny.
[175:57.92]It was on brand.
[175:59.36]It was good.
[176:01.72]But then you got this fucked up meme house with all these... I'm going to tell you I take points off of this.
[176:07.16]I'm taking points off of this.
[176:08.90]What?
[176:09.92]I'm taking at least one point off of this.
[176:12.71]That was like the first picture we added.
[176:14.53]That was the first picture you added?
[176:17.06]I made that photo.
[176:18.00]That was like...
[176:20.23]That was his first idea.
[176:21.62]And he told us, like, he was like, yeah, you know, we should add this because Jerma's short, is what he said.
[176:26.81]I made those photos.
[176:28.81]I made the photos of you leaking your stream.
[176:33.12]But that was a whole layer, too.
[176:35.22]We're talking about layers, right?
[176:37.48]having what I believe is snuffy's chat do that to capture that to put the fake chatted I mean that's funny that's real fucking yeah can somebody post uh can somebody post the picture behind Jeremy in the Discord so I can have it forever and that is my favorite part I've got a couple more of those too I have an album I'll post it later for y'all I need that
[177:03.70]Scooby-Doo is so... Okay, here we go.
[177:06.17]I'm going to rip a band-aid off and I'm going to eliminate one of you right now.
[177:10.75]Let me put on some fucking music.
[177:13.04]I'm going to type in elimination music.
[177:15.56]Let's drag it out.
[177:16.00]Do Piglet's Big Game.
[177:17.06]Oh, no.
[177:18.94]I'm back.
[177:19.32]Piglet's Big Game.
[177:22.93]Dog's Life Factory OST.
[177:26.07]The team that will not be moving on.
[177:30.35]It was wonderful.
[177:31.19]It was so, it was great.
[177:32.75]It was amazing.
[177:33.58]But this is literally all A pluses.
[177:35.40]I can't, how do you choose?
[177:36.54]You can't.
[177:36.96]Right?
[177:39.35]Right?
[177:40.07]Right?
[177:40.83]I did the growl.
[177:44.98]R.T.
[177:45.30]Criken and Limes, thank you so much for coming.
[177:49.05]But you've been eliminated.
[177:50.91]Thank you for having us.
[177:52.65]Thank you for having us.
[177:54.02]Your manor was beautiful.
[177:55.90]It was wonderful.
[177:57.46]It was.
[177:57.88]Thank you.
[177:58.54]Your guys is the most beautiful by a factor of 100.
[178:02.03]It was a classic haunted mansion with Christian Hell in the basement.
[178:06.04]It was fucking phenomenal.
[178:07.92]It was amazing.
[178:09.43]RT, bring those cards on Thursday, baby.
[178:13.34]I'm coming for you.
[178:14.78]If you guys want to stick around, there's going to be a little bit left after this.
[178:18.78]If you want to stick around, by all means.
[178:20.27]We'll stick around.
[178:21.83]The Ballatrope.
[178:23.51]Top builders of this entire three-part series here.
[178:27.78]We've done this three times now.
[178:29.60]And Limes, you are a new addition, but RT and Criken are the top builders, I'd say, of this entire group.
[178:35.93]So wonderful, wonderful job.
[178:37.43]Thanks a lot for coming again for the third time.
[178:39.05]You guys are amazing.
[178:40.37]Thanks for having us.
[178:40.93]Having such fun with your fucking friends is awesome.
[178:43.58]And I really mean it.
[178:45.04]I'm going to go have a cold shower and cry now.
[178:48.98]Thanks for having us.
[178:49.42]Okay.
[178:49.54]This is where it gets hard.
[178:50.94]Because what the fuck do I do?
[178:53.79]How do I pick between the two of you?
[178:56.29]You both had phenomenal things.
[178:59.37]The casino had that entire... You know what?
[179:02.08]I'm leaning casino still.
[179:04.56]And I'll tell you...
[179:06.32]It was a start to finish total coherent story, the entire thing.
[179:11.84]It was from the moment I opened that door to the moment I left.
[179:15.47]It was a complete and total story, the whole thing.
[179:21.65]There wasn't a stop.
[179:22.79]There wasn't a point where it was like, oh, hey, hold on.
[179:24.96]That was a full RP event the entire time I walked in.
[179:30.68]Does somebody have something to say?
[179:32.83]I have a proposal.
[179:35.01]Sure.
[179:35.39]Do with it what you will.
[179:36.88]Maybe the right way to honor the casino theme is that the winner is decided by a single roulette spin.
[179:44.83]Put it all on the line.
[179:47.60]Dad, dad, dad.
[179:49.02]We got red.
[179:49.52]We get red.
[179:51.72]We get red.
[179:53.89]That's really scary.
[179:54.69]Okay.
[179:54.99]Let's do it.
[179:56.19]Pick your favorite child.
[179:58.06]Let's do it.
[179:59.10]Is there like a roulette website?
[180:00.54]Coin flipper.
[180:03.97]Wait, flip a coin and House Flipper.
[180:05.87]Just drop it from the sky.
[180:07.69]We could do a coin flip.
[180:08.65]I can get a coin flip.
[180:09.35]Alright.
[180:11.92]Heads or tails, guys?
[180:13.44]Because honestly, I'm going to be honest.
[180:15.44]Tails.
[180:16.54]I don't think I can pick between the two of you.
[180:18.50]I don't think I can.
[180:19.20]You're both tied 100 out of 100.
[180:21.83]I don't think I can.
[180:22.77]You both win.
[180:23.99]Alright.
[180:26.47]Who wants to casino his heads?
[180:28.72]The casino will take the heads.
[180:33.32]I flipped on your hand and shown no funny business.
[180:37.97]Hold on.
[180:38.31]I found a video that's a 21 second video of an actual roulette wheel being spun.
[180:43.74]I haven't looked at the end.
[180:44.74]If I send you the link, Jerma, you watch it on stream and we go off of whatever the next role is.
[180:51.37]No, it's just one.
[180:52.01]It's a 20-second video, which is a single roulette spin.
[180:54.69]You probably already watched it.
[180:57.53]We just have to take your word for it?
[181:01.24]I told you so.
[181:02.36]Just let us win because I told you so.
[181:04.89]Silence!
[181:06.89]I'm going to flip the coin.
[181:07.95]I think that's just a 50-50 flip.
[181:11.52]What was that beat I just made?
[181:14.69]Are we ready?
[181:16.23]Who's heads?
[181:18.45]Who's heads?
[181:20.00]Casino's heads.
[181:20.56]Casino is heads.
[181:22.48]Okay.
[181:23.92]If it lands in the middle on the side, can I be a sudden comeback to team two?
[181:28.85]Wait, can you flip it?
[181:29.59]Can you move it away from your head?
[181:32.12]Yeah, where's it going to be the pog react?
[181:35.95]It's so scary with the piglet music over this.
[181:38.75]I'm nervous.
[181:40.61]Tails is the Jerma haunted house.
[181:44.48]Heads is the casino.
[181:45.68]Are we ready?
[181:46.88]We will vanquish the horsemen!
[181:48.97]The horsemen will fall!
[181:50.49]Give me heads, Jeremy!
[181:53.06]How dare you.
[181:55.16]Flipping!
[181:58.29]Let's go!
[181:58.81]It's heads!
[181:59.49]Casino wins!
[182:01.40]Yeah!
[182:01.52]Let's go!
[182:03.48]Let's go!
[182:04.18]We won an old fashioned way!
[182:10.65]That was hard.
[182:15.77]Congratulations, DougDoug, Stans, and Andre.
[182:23.13]Turn the music off.
[182:24.39]Turn the music off.
[182:26.44]Turn the music off.
[182:27.80]Turn the music off.
[182:28.72]Sorry, I'm leaving now.
[182:31.04]Doug Doug stands.
[182:32.26]Andre, you have won the competition.
[182:35.09]Thanks so much, Jeremiah.
[182:36.29]Thank you.
[182:36.79]But hold on a second.
[182:38.75]Oh.
[182:40.62]We have to decide who the ultimate winner is out of the three of you.
[182:46.42]Flip the coins.
[182:47.87]And here's how we're going to do that.
[182:51.08]you three and me are gonna be in a four-person 1v1v1v1 free-for-all battle royale mode right now to decide who the fucking best House Flipper 2 invitational participant is.
[183:04.81]We're doing it right now.
[183:06.99]Oh, that's why he eliminated the best builders.
[183:12.26]Let's do it.
[183:12.52]Oh, it makes sense now.
[183:14.88]No, it's because we have nine people.
[183:17.01]We have nine people.
[183:18.33]I have to participate.
[183:21.91]Please, if you could, this is important.
[183:25.05]This is going to be a... By the way, this is a bonus round.
[183:27.72]It's a total fuckface round.
[183:29.88]Are you guys good to do another few minutes here?
[183:32.30]It's been about three hours.
[183:34.44]I ordered a sandwich.
[183:35.59]I'll be fine.
[183:37.65]Because, ladies and gentlemen, let me show this on screen.
[183:44.56]We're going to an island and here are the rules.
[183:49.70]The rules are going to be as follows.
[183:53.65]We will have 40 minutes to build a house.
[183:58.81]And I will tell you, you're not going to be in edit mode.
[184:02.42]You are going to be doing this in the regular mode.
[184:06.94]So you have to build walls.
[184:08.71]You will also have the ability to use the sledgehammer.
[184:12.71]Here's the thing.
[184:14.91]When I call for it, whenever I feel like it,
[184:19.55]You will have three minutes to go do whatever the fuck you want to another person's house.
[184:30.81]You can do anything you want.
[184:32.22]Just no custom content.
[184:35.66]There is something that you all need to do before we do this.
[184:39.09]You need to unlock all the perks.
[184:41.86]And in the chat, there is a way to do that.
[184:43.98]Make sure to do this off.
[184:45.78]Don't open this on your stream.
[184:47.67]You're going to press F11.
[184:49.65]And on the account that you're on, you're going to type, I believe, let's see.
[184:55.25]It's like called unlock all tools.
[184:58.50]Unlock all perks.
[185:00.38]Should be in the chat here.
[185:01.60]Let me grab it.
[185:02.56]Can one of the mods grab it?
[185:03.42]I think it's a very precise thing you put in that console command.
[185:08.52]Because if you don't have the perks, your building is going to be insanely slow.
[185:15.51]I will host the game.
[185:20.00]And you don't need to get any files.
[185:22.29]I have the file.
[185:26.97]Question.
[185:27.84]Yes?
[185:28.87]Is there a way those that have been eliminated can watch?
[185:33.42]Because this sounds fun.
[185:34.68]If I do a Discord screen share, my fried-ass computer is not going to work.
[185:38.97]I'll share mine.
[185:39.89]I'll share mine.
[185:41.63]Can you guys go into the world and just not build?
[185:43.64]I don't know how many you're allowed in.
[185:44.50]I don't think there's a stand table.
[185:46.16]Only four.
[185:47.76]If a couple of you guys streamed, then we can just hop between them.
[185:50.33]You could also multi-Twitch all four.
[185:52.19]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[185:52.97]That should be delayed, yeah.
[185:54.79]How do we know if the console command worked?
[185:57.34]Um, if you go, when you go into the game and you hit tab, you should have a thing that says perks.
[186:03.51]It should be all filled in orange.
[186:06.09]So let's check once we get inside the world.
[186:09.10]If you want to just check right now, you can open up like any random game, just like, oh, just continue or whatever.
[186:13.26]You can go wherever you want and just hit tab and see, go to your perks menu.
[186:17.06]Okay.
[186:18.27]And if it's all orange, then you're good to go.
[186:21.07]Okay.
[186:21.45]Hitting tab.
[186:23.16]Yeah, let me check this.
[186:24.06]It is all orange.
[186:24.84]That means I'm like the Uber house builder?
[186:26.63]That means you are good to go.
[186:28.39]You are a complete Uber house builder.
[186:31.75]Okay, I'm ready.
[186:32.46]Here's another important question.
[186:34.56]Sure.
[186:36.14]If you're competing, who's judging?
[186:39.67]So... You'll see.
[186:43.43]Oh.
[186:43.87]Okay.
[186:44.94]That's fine.
[186:45.44]The judge for the... I didn't think that far.
[186:48.84]Okay.
[186:49.46]So the judge... I'll judge.
[186:50.92]I'll judge.
[186:52.12]Who wants to be the judge for this?
[186:53.60]I think Polk's your judge.
[186:54.82]Yeah, I'm down.
[186:56.38]Hell yeah.
[186:58.68]Okay.
[186:59.43]So again, let me get this reiterated one more time.
[187:03.93]The goal with this is for you to build a house with one bedroom.
[187:10.00]It's just whoever has the most structurally sound structure at the end of the 40 minutes.
[187:16.54]And again, you have to stay on your side until I call it.
[187:21.84]Yeah.
[187:23.56]Okay, I have something very spooky.
[187:24.84]The game is not loading, so I might need a minute or two.
[187:27.90]Yeah.
[187:28.95]You can restart the game if you need to.
[187:30.69]Who can make the most structurally sound wins?
[187:33.67]And we get three minutes to do whatever we want to destroy?
[187:36.66]When I call for sabotage, you can go wherever you want to whoever's house you want.
[187:42.18]Got it.
[187:42.72]And is that going to be at the end, or is this random?
[187:44.71]That is when I call for it, and it's going to be probably, you know, once every, I'd say, five to ten minutes.
[187:51.32]Oh, okay.
[187:52.04]Interesting.
[187:53.10]Oh, it's going to happen more than once?
[187:54.34]It's going to happen very frequently.
[187:56.92]Okay.
[187:58.51]I am going to make the game.
[188:00.11]I will put the thing in here for all of you.
[188:03.25]Don't leak this.
[188:09.22]I would never.
[188:10.88]I'm full cam right now from my new stream room.
[188:18.57]And then I'm going to click play on this.
[188:20.33]So we, you're not, by the way, very important.
[188:23.58]You're not going to be able to fly.
[188:24.88]You are not going to be able to do any no clipping.
[188:27.70]You've got to build a real house here.
[188:29.40]You have to actually do it.
[188:31.21]I will get, I will help.
[188:32.71]I will give tips if I need to.
[188:34.41]If you don't know how to build a wall, I will help.
[188:37.27]But then I'm going to come mess you up when the sabotage happens.
[188:43.98]This is like WWE House Flipper too.
[188:46.38]This is awesome.
[188:48.40]Okay, I've got a plan.
[188:50.61]Again, say it out loud.
[188:52.05]Is everybody else's Steam working?
[188:55.03]I literally can't even log into Steam.
[188:56.46]Oh, Tuesday.
[188:57.82]Tuesday Steam maintenance.
[188:58.98]Tuesday Steam maintenance.
[189:00.32]It goes up for an hour.
[189:01.40]It starts at 6 p.m.
[189:02.56]It's usually like 30 minutes to an hour.
[189:04.45]Tuesday Steam maintenance, yeah.
[189:06.29]Did we hit the maintenance?
[189:08.03]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[189:11.92]It might not be long.
[189:12.86]It differs.
[189:15.44]Mine usually comes back up within about 10 minutes.
[189:17.60]It's already been like 15 minutes, maybe.
[189:19.41]Probably since you saw our house and since you've been explaining.
[189:23.35]Just keep explaining.
[189:24.21]It might come up by then.
[189:25.98]Same time next week, maybe?
[189:29.28]No, I ain't planning another day for this.
[189:31.36]We're doing another Find the Day.
[189:34.05]House Flipper's just slobbering.
[189:35.91]Oh yeah, day three, baby.
[189:38.82]Oh yeah, maybe I can go out, like run it off of Steam.
[189:43.13]Wait, I think we're good.
[189:44.35]Doug's in.
[189:45.01]We're good, we're good.
[189:46.55]Stan's, you're in here.
[189:47.99]Yeah, I'm in here.
[189:48.80]I only see you, though.
[189:50.20]I don't have the code.
[189:51.76]It's in the general chat.
[189:53.10]In the general?
[189:55.39]Oh, that's the code.
[189:57.85]Well, good luck to the finalists and stuff.
[189:59.99]This is going to be exciting to see.
[190:01.41]I love vanilla House Flipper.
[190:04.27]I hope you guys jump off of ladders and fight each other.
[190:07.55]I love all the mechanics of House Flipper.
[190:13.10]Before we start, I will give a quick tutorial.
[190:16.02]Okay.
[190:17.96]I'm going to destroy you.
[190:18.86]House Flipper is just cleaning the houses.
[190:20.95]To be perfectly honest, picking up the garbage and stuff.
[190:23.85]I'm going to destroy you, Jeremy Elbertson.
[190:27.17]I look forward to it.
[190:29.84]Alright.
[190:30.06]Sorry, I was not able to get in earlier.
[190:32.50]So I hit F11 and menu and then just type learn all perks.
[190:35.37]Yeah.
[190:37.35]It's a very specific string.
[190:40.52]Otherwise, it would take like 10 minutes to build one wall.
[190:44.76]But once I'm in F11 in the console, I just type learn all perks.
[190:47.48]Yeah.
[190:47.74]Tap into the text prompt and then.
[190:50.27]Yeah.
[190:50.87]Okay.
[190:51.39]Cool.
[190:51.63]Learn dash all that.
[190:52.75]It's like a capital.
[190:54.41]Yeah.
[190:55.49]Cool.
[190:56.44]Alright.
[190:57.32]I assume.
[190:58.56]Yeah.
[190:58.74]It didn't say anything to me that didn't work.
[190:59.86]Yeah.
[191:00.22]I think it just does.
[191:00.98]And you can confirm in the game that if you hit tab and you go to perks, you should see if it's not orange.
[191:07.59]Yeah.
[191:11.13]Okay, I think I'm in.
[191:12.72]Alright.
[191:14.34]But when we get in, make sure everyone's good to go.
[191:15.96]Okay, I'm loading the game.
[191:27.85]So when you're in, you will see that this is split.
[191:30.87]Let me get the game on screen.
[191:33.86]We are split into four quadrants.
[191:36.61]You cannot fly, by the way.
[191:38.45]Also check your perks.
[191:40.15]Should be all orange.
[191:42.98]How do you do it?
[191:44.62]Tab and then perks.
[191:48.18]Got it.
[191:48.56]Cool.
[191:49.62]Tag perks.
[191:53.97]Okay.
[191:54.25]Okay.
[191:54.93]Mine are working.
[191:57.15]I can hear the game, right?
[191:58.01]Yeah.
[192:00.86]Okay.
[192:00.98]Alright.
[192:01.99]Good luck to you.
[192:03.16]I would like to give you a quick tutorial, just for a few minutes.
[192:07.18]Okay.
[192:07.46]I believe we've picked our sides here.
[192:11.49]I'm good here?
[192:13.13]Yeah.
[192:13.25]Remember, your goal is to build.
[192:14.59]I would like to explain how to build.
[192:16.17]Right click.
[192:17.85]Building in the lower left.
[192:19.90]Yeah.
[192:20.32]You're going to pull up your hands here with the palette on it.
[192:25.34]You are going to click the same way that you normally would.
[192:28.15]Build the same way you normally would.
[192:29.37]Let's say you want to make a wall like this.
[192:31.81]When you put that down, it's not going to build it.
[192:33.66]You have to hover over it.
[192:35.48]Your perk allows you to build it very quickly as long as you are looking straight down at it.
[192:41.01]So you hold left click and you will just drop these bricks very quickly.
[192:46.46]Make sure you jump on it to make it go way faster.
[192:49.39]You have to be looking straight down at it.
[192:51.35]this would take like a full minute to do what I'm doing if we didn't do this I see gang I'm just gonna dip for the night now my end I'm gonna leave my crowd in your care and that but thank you so much for having us tonight Jerma yeah dude it was awesome thank you so much for coming I'm gonna dip from here have a good one best of luck destroy him now and you don't build over your edge by the way
[193:18.69]Now, I would like for you to avert your attention to the demolishing tool.
[193:24.26]Right click, lower right, the little hammer.
[193:28.44]This actually has physics.
[193:30.21]If you hold left click, you can smash up walls.
[193:35.91]Oh, that's so awesome.
[193:37.59]This is like when you got beat up by your brother.
[193:39.52]Oh, please do not destroy the wall here.
[193:45.30]That was you.
[193:48.26]Gonna fix it.
[193:49.74]Okay, besides that, same rules apply here.
[193:52.42]You can do, you know, obviously get rid of all the things you've made.
[193:55.83]The store is still here.
[193:57.77]You have unlimited money, so you don't have to worry about spending any money.
[194:02.63]Okay.
[194:04.10]We're gonna clear it.
[194:06.52]Anything else I think you guys should know?
[194:08.12]Walls, paint.
[194:09.28]Oh, paint is important too.
[194:11.28]If you want to paint a wall,
[194:13.25]You have to actually do it now instead of just picking the thing and selecting.
[194:16.99]So you're going to go to, you can just go to the store and type in paint.
[194:20.38]Oh my God.
[194:20.96]These buckets.
[194:22.60]Physically?
[194:23.04]Oh, you have to buy paint.
[194:24.02]You have to physically buy the, let's say blue paint, vibrant blue paint, buy it, put it on the ground.
[194:31.29]You then have a paint rolling tool in right click.
[194:34.65]You have to dip it in.
[194:36.46]And we're still, we're going to destroy each other's stuff.
[194:38.58]You got to paint the walls manually.
[194:42.36]Okay.
[194:42.76]Fair enough.
[194:47.27]WASD is easier.
[194:50.33]Okay.
[194:54.58]Oh yeah, it's way easier.
[194:56.03]Okay.
[194:59.07]This would take so much longer if we didn't have the perks, by the way.
[195:01.70]Wait, how do I paint it?
[195:02.76]I have my thing full.
[195:04.24]You just click on a wall and then you use WASD.
[195:08.09]If you, by the way, use the scroll to change the size.
[195:13.12]You can make it huge.
[195:14.18]Oh.
[195:14.88]Do you have, I can't like, is it because it's your wall?
[195:16.72]I can't interact with it?
[195:17.70]You have to actually dip the paintbrush into this.
[195:20.49]Oh, I did dip the paint, but now there's like a blue thing.
[195:23.15]What the heck?
[195:24.51]Oh, I think you can set paint border.
[195:27.43]I think that's, oh, that must be it.
[195:28.44]So you click and hold.
[195:29.26]Yeah, you can set a border.
[195:31.32]Oh, that explains it.
[195:32.28]Okay, cool.
[195:32.80]I get it.
[195:35.35]Okay.
[195:37.21]There's no cleaning we need to do.
[195:38.19]There's no trash.
[195:40.29]That's pretty much all you need to know.
[195:41.57]You guys already know how to sell stuff.
[195:46.76]Let's get a clean slate.
[195:48.73]Also, it's not going to be three minutes.
[195:53.55]When I call sabotage, it's going to be more like 60 seconds.
[195:56.20]Because looking at this right now, you could probably destroy somebody's entire house.
[196:00.40]But that's the Battle Royale, man.
[196:01.81]That's just, hey, that's the way it is.
[196:04.84]So true.
[196:06.00]Mowing their lawn already.
[196:07.97]Open up the pit.
[196:09.53]I'm just testing.
[196:10.83]Just testing.
[196:16.72]When are we starting?
[196:17.76]No, not yet.
[196:18.30]I'm going to get some cool ass music.
[196:20.94]Okay, let me take this wall down then.
[196:25.47]Yeah, get situated.
[196:26.07]If you have any more questions before we get started, we're going to go.
[196:27.63]We have 40 minutes.
[196:29.07]Just testing some stuff.
[196:30.93]Do whatever you need to do.
[196:31.97]Test however much you want.
[196:35.39]I need a good OST for this.
[196:40.57]What's a good OST for this?
[196:44.72]That's true.
[196:45.46]What is the music for this?
[196:47.48]How do I get rid of an item once I've... So, like, I was testing out the lawnmower.
[196:51.98]Now it's just sitting on my property.
[196:53.42]If you right-click, there's a cell.
[196:56.53]That's a good idea.
[196:57.69]What a good idea that is.
[196:58.85]Lime?
[197:00.49]You're so smart.
[197:02.49]Okay.
[197:03.11]okay interesting uh yeah you should be able there's a that like sell the I think it's called the let me see what the tool is called flipper tool uh the flipper tool yeah you should be able to sell whatever you're right thank you okay cleaning vacuuming demolishing building hands and then where's sorry store where do we find the store uh tab and store and perks you're just gonna be looking at store yeah that operates the same way as you're used to yeah
[197:30.03]Okay.
[197:31.83]How does everybody feel?
[197:33.85]Everybody feel okay?
[197:35.63]I'm excited.
[197:36.51]Good luck.
[197:39.06]When you hear me call for a sabotage, it's going to happen every five to ten minutes.
[197:43.58]Let me set my timer.
[197:45.32]We're doing 40 total minutes, right?
[197:46.85]40 total minutes.
[197:47.69]That's correct.
[197:53.75]Let me get this in the right spot, which it is not.
[197:59.91]There it is.
[198:05.05]Bods are dead.
[198:05.99]Rest in peace.
[198:07.30]Okay.
[198:08.40]Let me get my music.
[198:19.89]Nandri and Strands, I don't want to destroy you.
[198:23.72]Strands rules.
[198:25.10]Strands rules.
[198:26.00]Oh, yeah.
[198:26.42]Well, I think we should... You guys already doing... Why don't we... We should all just agree to just beat up Jerma's house on the first sabotage, right?
[198:33.89]Like, we got to destroy that thing, right?
[198:35.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:36.93]Okay.
[198:37.13]That's what I thought we were going to do.
[198:40.73]Should have stayed in that HOA, baby.
[198:43.87]Okay.
[198:44.45]I got my music going.
[198:47.02]Wait, who's where?
[198:49.51]I have a proposal.
[198:50.89]I'm jumping.
[198:51.83]Before we start, can we all write our names in, like, wall at the back?
[198:57.48]Oh, I see what you mean.
[198:58.28]Like, yeah, like, just say, put, like... Or just, like, D, you know, like, the letter of your first name.
[199:02.13]That's good.
[199:03.17]That makes sense.
[199:03.67]It's like a big D. Okay, N is a little bit challenging.
[199:07.54]That's my only problem.
[199:09.70]Yeah, that's gonna be kind of hard to do.
[199:11.29]Well, yours is S. Mine is N.
[199:19.11]I will just be this pillar.
[199:22.95]Easy enough.
[199:26.42]Wait, mine is going to look like an O. Whatever.
[199:31.89]I'm going to just put a giant cross back here.
[199:35.34]Because I'm Jewish.
[199:36.40]I will be... It's going to look like a T to you guys.
[199:40.85]They said first initial chat.
[199:42.15]My first initial is Nathan.
[199:44.37]Oh, right.
[199:45.35]I forgot Stans isn't your real name.
[199:48.06]Well, it's my real name.
[199:49.04]It's just my real last name.
[199:50.16]It's not your real name.
[199:52.83]Wait, your last name is actually Stans?
[199:54.66]Yes, you knew that, Doug.
[199:55.98]I didn't know that, I swear.
[199:57.18]Yeah, my last name is actually Stans.
[199:58.61]I fucked up.
[200:00.79]I can't even get back up there.
[200:04.62]Okay, I did a lowercase D. Okay, so Stan, you're the pillar, Nutter, you're the cross.
[200:11.67]I'm making an N. It's just lowercase.
[200:14.91]I built this way too close to the edge.
[200:23.10]Are you going to show them your screen?
[200:28.16]Or are you going to just keep it on this cute graphic?
[200:31.04]Alright, that is a J. That's a good enough J.
[200:35.23]Right?
[200:35.99]Can you guys look over here and see?
[200:37.29]That's not a J. It's not even close, but whatever.
[200:39.70]Yeah, Jeremy, you're not showing your screen, just so you know.
[200:41.72]Oh, shit.
[200:42.78]Oh, fuck.
[200:42.98]That's so funny.
[200:43.76]How long could it have been?
[200:45.65]It was a little while.
[200:48.31]I built it too close to the edge.
[200:49.59]Do you guys understand that that's a J?
[200:53.76]Yeah.
[200:54.74]At this point, I think we're going to go.
[200:56.36]Yeah, I see a D. I see an S. I see the makings of an N.
[201:02.84]Alright, well, whatever.
[201:03.84]It's... I built it too close to the edge.
[201:05.72]Can you tell?
[201:07.45]For mine, can you tell?
[201:10.27]It's a dead tree.
[201:11.11]I can tell everything.
[201:11.91]I can't even change it.
[201:12.86]I can't even get up there.
[201:17.44]It's fine.
[201:17.87]We're gonna destroy the J anyways.
[201:20.05]No, I can fix it.
[201:26.08]Oh my god.
[201:26.62]How are we feeling?
[201:33.47]Stop calling it a five, Chad.
[201:34.73]It's an S. They're very similar.
[201:38.37]Yeah, man.
[201:39.03]Sure.
[201:41.04]We get it.
[201:41.56]You can count to five.
[201:44.98]I was still in the creative mode mentality and did not realize how long this would take us.
[201:49.75]I apologize for suggesting it.
[201:51.71]No, it's still a good idea.
[201:53.93]I think we can tell who's who.
[201:55.23]I got to join.
[201:57.29]Yeah.
[201:58.19]Doug, your D is great, and I don't say that lightly.
[202:00.97]It's like a T. Wait, now it's an A. It was good.
[202:05.06]No, no, no, I gotta break it.
[202:06.45]I'm making it uppercase.
[202:08.93]Wait, what?
[202:10.13]Oh, you're making it uppercase.
[202:11.86]I'm making D face.
[202:13.46]Got it.
[202:20.41]Mons, can we get a prediction in chat if you think anything will be left standing at the end of this competition?
[202:25.42]I do think destroying is so easy at this game.
[202:27.62]True.
[202:28.46]There we go.
[202:29.41]I got my J. Okay.
[202:35.94]I am ready.
[202:39.20]Gentlemen, it's been an honor to call you my compatriots and my HOA head.
[202:47.75]Thank you.
[202:48.01]But now you are my enemies.
[202:51.60]And I have never known defeat.
[202:53.92]It's time to begin.
[202:55.50]In the count of three, the finale is going to go through.
[202:58.80]40 minutes to make a house.
[203:02.47]And when I call sabotage, go wherever you want.
[203:04.65]Good luck.
[203:05.15]You have 10 to 25 seconds until we figure out it's way too long.
[203:10.34]And if you, by the way, if you break this rule, if it's like, hey, sabotage over, cease, cease, cease, and you don't listen, you're disqualified immediately.
[203:19.83]Three.
[203:20.41]Sounds good.
[203:21.17]Two.
[203:22.25]One.
[203:22.51]Good luck.
[203:22.86]40 minutes.
[203:23.92]Good luck, gentlemen.
[203:27.02]I'm blocking it.
[203:27.50]I'm going to be quiet.
[203:36.50]This is what it feels like when you work on a group project with people you don't like and you're just like in a call with all of them.
[204:07.48]I feel like I'm like a fucking dentist.
[204:09.72]I don't know why, I just felt like a dentist for a second.
[204:45.72]Watch this.
[205:13.35]My house is way too fucking big!
[205:27.14]No, that's a bad plan.
[205:43.28]Where'd it go?
[207:43.35]This is making me feel like a dentist.
[207:45.57]It's so quiet in this call.
[207:51.92]I don't know.
[207:52.28]He keeps making some fucking dentist joke.
[207:54.18]I don't know.
[207:59.61]It's like, it's so frustrating because you're trying to lock it in focus and it's so competitive, you know?
[208:04.40]And I'm like, I don't know.
[208:06.30]It's just like kind of like a bad bit.
[208:08.08]It's, I don't know.
[208:09.59]Whatever.
[208:10.61]I wasn't listening.
[208:11.15]I'm sorry.
[208:15.11]I'm sorry, I thought I was on push-to-talk.
[208:22.30]It's like we know he goes to the dentist, though.
[208:24.34]It's like, we get it, dude, you have teeth.
[208:26.63]It's like... I feel like he's really lampshading the whole dentist thing.
[208:31.11]Now it's a dentist.
[208:38.51]I'm still unmuted, oh god.
[208:49.74]Doug is in the sky?
[208:50.96]What the fuck?
[208:57.27]Reach me up here, you motherfuckers!
[209:00.43]Yeah, that looks really structurally stable, Doug.
[209:02.45]That's not even a house!
[209:03.40]You didn't even build the house!
[209:07.74]He's just fucking building a stairway.
[209:10.53]I survived Minecraft off of one block in the sky.
[209:19.05]Bro's clearly never been to the dentist.
[209:35.84]Beautiful, good, good!
[209:36.90]Look at this fucking place, it's gonna be sick.
[209:45.15]Oh, it builds so much faster when you do small walls.
[210:19.76]I don't know what the fuck those are.
[210:22.29]This place is fucking massive!
[210:25.14]What am I doing?
[210:25.86]Oh God, okay.
[210:28.49]Something's coming here.
[211:03.45]The shit's coming down.
[211:05.72]Someone just asked, is there a chance that you just like don't even call sabotage?
[211:12.54]And I told them he would never do something like that.
[211:14.71]He has too much chaos in his life.
[211:17.33]Yeah, well, I got news for you.
[211:19.01]You got about two minutes before that happens.
[211:21.61]Hope you guys are ready.
[211:26.18]This is so hard when I'm colorblind.
[211:28.16]I actually have no idea what the hell I'm doing, man.
[211:52.36]Nice vomit color.
[211:53.92]You don't know what I'm doing here.
[211:55.64]You have no idea what this is.
[212:03.30]This was planned specifically to prevent... I'm not going to give my hand, my cards away.
[212:50.29]Why can't- I'm trying to- I'm typing in OST pizza time.
[213:11.41]Guys, uh, I got a quick thing to tell you.
[213:15.14]Uh, go ahead.
[213:16.26]Wait, no, no, no, no.
[213:16.98]Don't tell me.
[213:17.82]It's sabotage time!
[213:21.39]Okay, well, actually, Doug kind of owned me.
[213:24.19]I'm trapped in my own house!
[213:26.58]Yeah, try to get up here!
[213:28.26]Just try and get up here!
[213:29.96]I gotta get out of my own house!
[213:34.23]Wait, what?
[213:35.01]Is this even a house?
[213:39.39]What the fuck did you make over here?
[213:42.88]And stay out!
[213:45.80]Oh, I see it.
[213:46.68]Stay away from Doug Doug!
[213:49.57]How did you do that?
[213:49.99]You're not welcome here!
[213:51.29]You're not welcome here, Jerma.
[213:54.28]Okay.
[213:54.40]I'm getting up there.
[214:01.04]No, stay away.
[214:01.88]How do I drop things?
[214:03.68]Jerma, is there physics?
[214:04.44]Could I drop, like, tar and feather on him?
[214:08.21]Hot oil.
[214:10.17]Hot dog.
[214:16.71]I'm gonna use all my time.
[214:18.62]How do I drop?
[214:19.56]How do I drop items?
[214:22.02]What the fuck?
[214:22.76]You're so high in the air.
[214:24.54]Wait, okay.
[214:25.17]If I build a wall out over him that he can't reach me.
[214:28.23]Where's my house?
[214:32.47]Steal the paint, steal the paint, steal the paint, steal the paint, steal the paint.
[214:35.76]Alright, get around that stance.
[214:38.88]It's impossible.
[214:40.10]I can't get up there.
[214:43.01]I'm gonna keep working on my house.
[214:44.61]Okay.
[214:45.47]Yeah, what if, to destroy is evil.
[214:47.65]What if we only build?
[214:51.94]My plan is I get my house in place, and then I spend the rest of the time destroying your organizers.
[214:56.60]Damn it!
[214:57.03]I need- Time's up!
[214:59.47]Time's up!
[214:59.99]Time's up!
[215:00.75]Time's up!
[215:01.77]Back to your stations.
[215:02.81]Back to your stations.
[215:03.33]It's been two minutes.
[215:04.95]Oh, fuck me, man.
[215:08.40]Actually, you did me a favor.
[215:11.24]Did I?
[215:11.42]This looks pretty sweet, actually.
[215:18.08]I don't even know if this is the meta.
[215:20.44]We survived another night.
[215:21.79]I realized I was shit-talking you guys the whole time, but my mic was off.
[215:27.64]Huge mistake.
[215:29.08]Wait.
[215:29.36]We could feel the vibes.
[215:30.22]Don't worry.
[215:31.12]A beautiful window.
[215:32.13]Do I not finish this?
[215:36.53]I can't.
[215:55.22]I don't want to hear a fucking ad.
[216:00.13]No YouTube premium?
[216:02.53]No, dude.
[216:02.95]I'm a fucking idiot.
[216:09.72]Oh, beautiful.
[216:12.77]The hammer does make beautifully placed windows.
[216:19.49]That actually was pretty helpful.
[216:21.06]Okay.
[216:21.62]You know what?
[216:22.04]Good.
[216:22.48]Good idea.
[217:04.66]Good opening.
[218:03.62]This is a fucking artichoke.
[218:05.65]What is that?
[218:33.24]Doug, I didn't know you could fly.
[218:43.82]Apparently... Look, I'll reveal it.
[218:48.11]If you build a roof, you fly during it.
[218:58.45]Alright, no reaction.
[218:59.33]I guess they don't realize what that implies.
[219:01.09]Uh, no, no, we- I was already- I already flew.
[219:03.20]We already knew.
[219:03.86]We already knew.
[219:04.52]We already knew, honestly.
[219:07.02]That's not what I used to get up here, by the way.
[219:09.02]Scummy move by you.
[219:10.92]I literally made a roof.
[219:11.93]I did nothing else.
[219:14.39]Yeah, whatever, man.
[219:15.17]We get it.
[219:16.91]Trench warfare.
[219:17.93]I'm stuck against my wall.
[219:20.36]I cannot move.
[219:22.04]Can't demolish it out?
[219:22.98]Oh, never mind.
[219:23.48]I'm back.
[219:23.80]I'm back.
[219:24.00]I'm back.
[219:24.80]You can always escape unstuck.
[219:27.86]Oh, thank you.
[219:30.81]Especially if you, you know, use the laundry machine.
[219:43.84]Dead.
[219:54.66]Three minutes until sabotage.
[220:00.99]Guys, guys, we have to come to a democratic position here.
[220:06.30]Yup.
[220:06.50]Yeah, we're gonna fuck your shit up.
[220:08.40]That's the democratic position.
[220:09.88]No, no, no.
[220:10.20]Doug has a beautiful, perfect house in the sky.
[220:12.26]We have to help.
[220:12.84]We have to build up there.
[220:13.98]No, no, no, no.
[220:15.95]Jeremy, do you think that's structurally sound to have a building in the sky?
[220:20.87]All he needs to do is put one pole in the middle down to the ground, and he's got it.
[220:26.08]Physics.
[220:27.60]Well, we better make sure he doesn't have a pole.
[220:39.43]Oh shit.
[222:00.33]growing my business a nice accent while they're beautiful that'll make your guests feel better for the root canal
[222:55.07]Flakey, it's a battle royale.
[222:57.52]Everybody's building.
[222:58.52]Whoever has the most structurally sound house wins.
[223:01.87]And Jerm is at the dentist.
[223:04.37]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time.
[223:10.07]Sabotage, let's go.
[223:11.96]Bring it on.
[223:12.46]Alright.
[223:12.84]Guys, guys, guys.
[223:13.35]Go outside.
[223:14.77]Listen to me.
[223:15.55]Don't do anything to my house.
[223:17.17]Look at Doug Doug's house.
[223:18.01]It's beautiful.
[223:18.57]He's going to win hands down.
[223:19.72]No doubt about it.
[223:20.74]Help me build up to Doug Doug's house because it's going to take like three of us to do this.
[223:24.30]Hey, get off my lawn.
[223:25.77]Three of us.
[223:26.35]That's my property.
[223:27.25]Wait, how do you get here?
[223:28.59]That's not fair.
[223:29.91]Wait.
[223:30.49]You shouldn't have told us about the roof, Dougie Dougie.
[223:34.14]You got to build a roof first.
[223:35.54]You got to build it to get up here.
[223:37.02]Yeah, well, there it is.
[223:39.31]Can I sell it?
[223:40.05]Hold on.
[223:42.09]You never said that we had to just destroy.
[223:46.46]We can fuck up your house by making it ugly as shit.
[223:50.93]Enjoy all these roofs, motherfucker.
[223:54.65]Goddammit.
[223:55.17]Alright, I'm going to your place.
[223:56.79]You don't even know where my house is.
[224:02.40]God damn it.
[224:03.34]It was looking so good.
[224:04.87]It was looking real mighty fine.
[224:07.31]Did you keep up on the plan?
[224:08.73]Brother, I figured out the answer.
[224:10.13]What?
[224:13.94]Nandria, what kind of idiot builds a house with no door?
[224:17.86]This one.
[224:20.91]Alright, boys, up here.
[224:22.71]I just had to quickly do a little bit of a detour.
[224:26.25]Why is everybody teaming up on me, dude?
[224:28.43]Stance, how do we get up there?
[224:29.93]I'm getting in here.
[224:32.38]I'm building stairs.
[224:33.78]I'm building stairs.
[224:35.48]Why is this full of dumpsters?
[224:37.64]What is going on?
[224:38.04]He's got the best house.
[224:39.16]He's got the best house by far.
[224:42.13]Get out of my house.
[224:43.17]Get out of my property.
[224:46.09]Doug, you need to go protect yourself.
[224:47.86]Have you heard of the third amendment?
[224:49.08]You're not allowed in unless I invite you.
[224:50.78]I can't.
[224:52.35]We can't even get in.
[224:53.72]Oh my God.
[224:54.42]Sell the roofs.
[224:55.26]Sell the roofs.
[224:56.36]Don't sell my roof.
[224:57.98]I'm selling the roofs.
[225:00.95]Dude, I told you defensive roofs was a strat.
[225:02.91]No one believed me.
[225:04.19]We got 20 seconds.
[225:05.94]Oh, they... He has fortified this fucking house.
[225:12.25]10 seconds.
[225:17.05]Wait, I can just build walls in front of you guys.
[225:20.67]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[225:21.89]That's enough, that's enough.
[225:22.87]Back, back, back, back, back, back.
[225:25.96]Look at my disaster, dude.
[225:27.98]No!
[225:30.04]Yeah, Doug, enjoy your fucking roofs, buddy.
[225:34.93]Enjoy your 8,000 toilets, Jerma.
[225:37.85]What?
[225:38.13]That's my, the toilet house is my house, man.
[225:42.39]You put a bunch of porcelain in my front yard!
[225:45.23]Dude, my house is fucking pristine!
[225:48.22]I'm good to go!
[225:49.58]Dude, this is so ugly.
[225:54.65]Okay.
[225:56.09]Don't like those.
[225:57.37]I need... Maybe give me some more of these?
[226:01.32]You guys are not invited to my housewarming party.
[226:04.19]I didn't want to come.
[226:10.72]I gotta get up.
[226:12.20]I gotta do this right now.
[226:19.45]Okay.
[226:22.30]This is surely something.
[226:23.50]No.
[226:36.76]Oh, there we go.
[226:37.70]Much better.
[226:55.81]No worries.
[226:57.97]Okay, so you need to hold and not tap.
[226:59.99]That's the trick.
[227:01.78]Oh, I'm still- dude.
[227:21.20]I gotta move.
[227:21.94]I gotta move on.
[227:30.67]Thank you.
[230:14.82]What is this?
[230:15.24]Resident Evil puzzle?
[230:17.35]No!
[230:17.94]I'm not going to explain what this is until my tour.
[230:45.63]Nah, you can just walk over those.
[230:47.01]I thought he'd get stuck.
[231:09.14]Why am I even using the front door?
[231:30.54]Whatever.
[231:39.19]I need to save.
[231:51.52]I need a counter.
[232:11.12]Got one minute until another sabotage run.
[232:16.55]What if we just did do sabotage?
[232:19.79]We could not, possibly, but we're gonna have to get another one in.
[232:25.00]I'm just having so much fun, you know?
[232:28.45]Who has the dumpster house?
[232:29.85]Whose house is that?
[232:32.11]Sorry, what?
[232:34.05]That would be mine.
[232:34.73]Okay, I was wondering.
[232:39.84]There's a plan.
[232:47.60]I'm so grandma chic.
[233:08.02]Okay.
[233:13.27]Hey boys!
[233:20.93]Sabotage time!
[233:27.82]Let's go.
[233:28.34]God damn it.
[233:32.86]These- Before you do this, let's have a conversation.
[233:35.99]Let's have a quick conversation.
[233:37.43]Okay.
[233:37.93]Now here's the deal.
[233:39.07]Doug has a mansion in the sky.
[233:41.39]I don't need to hit you.
[233:42.91]In fact, we can just sit in this little swing and swing together.
[233:49.08]Your house is too good.
[233:50.73]It's way too good.
[233:51.82]It's way too nice in here.
[233:52.92]What do you mean it's way too nice?
[233:54.28]It's actually perfect in here.
[233:55.40]This is like a disaster.
[233:56.38]You might win.
[233:58.05]No, it's not a disaster.
[234:00.55]I didn't want to have to do this.
[234:01.47]I'm going to your house.
[234:02.20]No, no, no.
[234:02.64]Wait, let's talk.
[234:03.20]Let's sit back.
[234:03.74]I'm taking one hit.
[234:05.80]I'm taking one hit.
[234:06.42]I'm taking out the middle section.
[234:08.15]This couch is pointless.
[234:12.42]Okay, we're chilling, we're chilling, we're chilling.
[234:20.25]I thought maybe I could go defensive with those.
[234:22.59]It did not work.
[234:23.59]It kind of did.
[234:24.37]I'm going.
[234:26.45]Alright.
[234:27.59]And time's up.
[234:28.36]Imagine.
[234:31.64]This like Super Mario level that you have over here, Doug, is ridiculous.
[234:38.85]Is this even a house?
[234:49.93]How can you destroy that which you cannot find?
[234:52.27]30 seconds.
[234:58.26]I'm gonna sell your fucking plants.
[235:00.31]No, don't sell my plants, Jeremiah!
[235:01.93]I worked hard!
[235:02.79]I've been growing those this entire last 10 minutes!
[235:04.77]15 seconds.
[235:09.06]Oh my god, you guys have taken everything.
[235:16.36]I'm ruined.
[235:19.66]Wait, is someone back?
[235:20.84]What are you doing?
[235:24.01]I can't get out.
[235:27.49]I'm stuck.
[235:30.58]Put your tools away.
[235:31.32]Back to your places.
[235:33.48]Eight minutes left on the clock.
[235:35.75]Eight minutes left on the clock.
[235:39.26]That is how you fucking do it, baby.
[235:42.20]That's brutal.
[235:43.08]I got gang banged at grandma's Seaside cottage.
[235:46.21]There's fucking toilets everywhere.
[235:47.21]How do I get into my own house?
[235:50.08]Okay.
[235:51.48]Who's looking the best?
[235:52.24]I think we gotta team up on whoever's looking the best right now.
[235:54.26]It's over.
[235:54.86]There's no more sabotages.
[235:56.47]Doug and my house hasn't even been touched.
[236:04.30]I put a hundred toilets in there.
[236:06.18]What are you talking about?
[236:06.98]No, my setup, I have a cool set of a gamer on his and hers TV setup.
[236:11.25]His and hers TV.
[236:12.95]I've been setting up a secret house in the back that nobody has found the entire time.
[236:18.48]Nobody even touched my home.
[236:25.98]You fools.
[236:28.23]You fools.
[236:30.07]You absolute dinguses.
[236:34.07]I'll be honest, I did think you were just making a dumpster house.
[236:37.17]Exactly.
[236:37.95]I did too.
[236:40.84]There are at least 87 roofs in my home.
[236:48.55]I went to your house and I just spammed the roof button the entire first sabotage.
[236:56.10]Oh, that was you?
[236:56.58]I thought that was defensive roofs for Doug.
[236:58.64]No, they're ugly.
[237:04.31]And now all I have to do is just delete all the shit that is designed to distract you.
[237:12.60]My genius plan.
[237:15.06]My barricade of dumpsters.
[237:18.08]Jeremy, I have a proposal.
[237:19.49]Yep.
[237:20.55]One last one-minute sabotage.
[237:22.35]No way!
[237:23.25]And then we present our final hopes.
[237:25.97]By the way, we are getting another sabotage in five minutes.
[237:29.12]That's how it was going to go.
[237:30.96]Let's go!
[237:31.54]You should not have dropped your hand, dude.
[237:34.59]I was not kidding.
[237:35.35]We're getting another one in 30 seconds, 40 seconds.
[237:37.99]What the hell?
[237:39.17]40 seconds?
[237:39.77]It's in 45 seconds.
[237:42.11]That is a load of horse hockey, Jerma.
[237:47.14]Gentlemen, we know the plan, right?
[237:48.58]He has a secret home.
[237:49.52]We have to take out the secret home.
[237:50.54]We've got to find the secret house.
[237:52.06]Guys, I'm 130 CCV.
[237:54.40]You've got to leave me alone.
[237:55.52]This is not fair.
[237:58.73]Come on, man.
[238:02.20]You are welcome to damage my home too, but I think we have to team up on Andre.
[238:06.85]Of course.
[238:08.35]We have 15 seconds.
[238:09.25]Get ready.
[238:15.22]I need a fridge quick.

[238:44.27]Oh, it's beautiful.
[238:47.01]No more bed.
[238:48.26]No more plants.
[238:52.81]We're actually ruining his whole house.
[238:55.52]Wait, is this a bait on a bait?
[238:57.18]Is this a bait on a bait?
[238:58.02]Is it in like a well?
[238:58.60]Do you have another one?
[238:59.62]Is there another one?
[239:00.30]There's another one, I think.
[239:04.21]Wait, do you think he started building a secret one?
[239:06.17]Oh no, he's destroying your place, Jerma.
[239:07.68]No, no, no, no.
[239:08.54]It's alright.
[239:09.64]Go for Stance.

[243:45.54]Oh, boy, what a disaster.
[243:46.94]OK, so Polk was going to be Polk.
[243:49.61]Should we we should have a panel, honestly.
[243:52.13]I mean, who else is around?
[243:53.27]Everyone's around.
[243:55.95]I'm here.
[243:56.94]You get anybody who's on the call around.
[243:58.58]Maybe you could try to judge with me.
[244:02.08]I think you could do it by democracy.
[244:03.38]I think how many people are here that want to do it?
[244:05.61]I'm here.
[244:06.65]I'm here.
[244:07.37]Okay, it's a panel of three or four judges.
[244:09.75]That's good to me.
[244:11.56]Yeah.
[244:11.72]Alright.
[244:14.48]Dermot, how do you feel about you tour all the houses and then everybody's watching your stream and going off that?
[244:20.61]Okay, that works.
[244:23.17]So you guys maybe can stick around and watch while I go through them and maybe you can speak on to what fuck Stans is going to win.
[244:30.19]No, get out of here.
[244:33.02]Don't spoil it.
[244:34.24]I'm also going to vote stands.
[244:35.34]Thank you guys so much.
[244:37.83]I had a beautiful home that was destroyed with rocks and garbage.
[244:46.08]Alright.
[244:47.10]Actually, Doug, you've got a... I don't know.
[244:50.45]Where do you want to start, Jerma?
[244:52.93]I'll start with mine.
[244:53.79]Let's get it out of the way.
[244:56.12]Okay.
[244:57.79]I've been watching your stream the whole time, Gemma.
[245:00.23]It's beautiful.
[245:01.21]Thank you so much.
[245:01.87]I appreciate it.
[245:03.17]Oh, what?
[245:04.46]This is your front door?
[245:06.20]I'm a little confused by the... It's a little bit of a work in progress, but it's an open concept.
[245:12.51]Okay.
[245:12.87]Welcome to the house.
[245:13.91]Thank you for showing up, everybody.
[245:15.21]Appreciate it.
[245:16.57]So if we start here... Are we pressing play on the piglet?
[245:20.36]Oh, yeah.
[245:20.70]Let's play the piglet.
[245:22.94]Where is that sound?
[245:24.48]There it is.
[245:25.13]Okay.
[245:25.25]Cool.
[245:27.23]Okay, so here we are.
[245:28.82]Welcome.
[245:29.72]As you see here, I wanted to make sure that there was a receptacle out here.
[245:32.92]Probably the only one that decided to do this.
[245:36.73]Never mind.
[245:37.45]But my receptacle is... Don't look at the other receptacles.
[245:40.80]Mine is a real one.
[245:41.88]It's designed for a home.
[245:44.40]Wonders is literally made out of receptacles.
[245:48.49]basketball uh no basketball court but I figured you could get some friends over and just kind of pick it up and throw the ball at each other and you know play like dodgeball with it see pick one up you can play dodgeball right oh well that's kind of fun that's super fun
[246:02.62]Cool.
[246:02.98]It's like an outdoor activity.
[246:05.10]Beach activity too, you could say.
[246:06.31]As you see, I've got some beautiful windows.
[246:10.09]These windows were put.
[246:11.80]They're very functional.
[246:13.74]If you come on inside here, we have the... Oh, it's the kitchen.
[246:19.57]We have the kitchen.
[246:21.33]Very postmodern.
[246:22.50]Very postmodern.
[246:23.44]Yeah, how do we open the fridge?
[246:24.54]The fridge, it doesn't open.
[246:27.48]I had a guy come over.
[246:29.63]The fridge was leaking coolant, so they had to come over.
[246:32.01]Is your window a door?
[246:33.29]Well, I wanted to make sure that there was ample fresh air that you could get to come through.
[246:41.58]And who wants a cumbersome window when you could have a big sliding door?
[246:44.66]That locks, by the way.
[246:45.70]It locks with a deadbolt.
[246:47.51]Window doesn't do that.
[246:49.13]Two of them in case you need to have that.
[246:50.95]So anyways, this is the kitchen.
[246:52.23]And there was a little bit of food that I ate.
[246:54.73]I was very hungry.
[246:56.07]I had a little bit of the food.
[246:57.73]If you take a walk through here, though, this is the living room area.
[247:00.00]And this is a wonderful, wonderful addition that I heard about.
[247:04.90]Blue pops out the wall.
[247:07.04]You've got a his and hers TV.
[247:08.94]The couch is huge.
[247:10.21]So let's say you want to watch something on this TV, but somebody else wants to watch something on that TV.
[247:15.41]You can watch two different shows at the same time and not bother the person next to you.
[247:18.41]Same channel, though.
[247:19.11]Wow.
[247:21.02]Yeah, we both want to watch Toad and Lobster.
[247:23.44]They both might want to watch the same thing.
[247:26.50]I'm guessing those headphones are to allow each person to listen unimpeded by the... Yes, the wires that come through here go into, obviously, the different sections.
[247:33.97]The couch is a beautiful couch.
[247:35.21]These are wired headphones connected to the TV.
[247:38.30]They're wired.
[247:41.22]I was a big fan of the Minecraft movie.
[247:45.71]So I decided I wanted to add a little bit of an accent over here with the green.
[247:50.04]Oh, it's meant to look like a creeper blew it up.
[247:51.58]Yes, it's supposed to be like a. And then obviously I got the I got, you know, you know, I'm cool here.
[247:57.17]You know, I'm not going to hide it that I do that.
[248:00.61]I'm just kind of here.
[248:02.12]What is it that you're doing?
[248:03.46]You know, it's kind of everywhere.
[248:06.65]I leave it around the house to make sure that I have enough of a supply when I want to, you know, smoke a little.
[248:13.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah, parsley.
[248:15.04]Into the bathroom here, we've got a beautiful tub, but the tub is... Oh, the zebra.
[248:19.59]Yeah, I... It was an inspired choice to switch to the zebra tub at the last minute.
[248:24.52]Can you speak to the color choices here?
[248:26.26]I see kind of a mustard green.
[248:29.73]Mustard green.
[248:30.99]Mustard green rules.
[248:31.75]Well, it's pea green because it's supposed to remind you of what you're doing in here.
[248:36.31]As soon as I forget when I go to the bathroom.
[248:39.26]Rebuild that for you.
[248:40.16]Sorry.
[248:40.80]I don't typically do green.
[248:44.26]Is this a green piss?
[248:47.29]Are you saying this is usually the color for you?
[248:52.05]Is it not for you?
[248:52.89]Is it not for you guys?
[248:54.83]The more green wall.
[248:57.13]You said it's green in here like you're piss.
[249:00.02]And you were looking at that on my screen.
[249:02.48]I got a nice wallpaper here.
[249:04.89]From the inside here, obviously the fresh air can come in.
[249:08.57]No, you want to drink water, dude.
[249:10.46]It's a good wallpaper.
[249:12.48]If we find the final room here, this is a yoga studio.
[249:18.34]Oh, yoga.
[249:20.66]There's no mats, I see.
[249:21.92]You don't subscribe to the comforts of yoga.
[249:23.92]Well, you bring your own mat, and that's why we have the windows here, and these are... Oh, the windows are for, like, posting your mats through?
[249:33.93]So you don't have to go through the rest of the house?
[249:35.47]Privacy.
[249:37.22]Oh, yeah, the shower curtains are something.
[249:39.84]Oh, air drying your towels.
[249:41.90]What kind of heating you got in this place?
[249:43.88]Forced air central.
[249:45.39]um it is whatever it temperature is outside so it's very drastic I am noticing an awful lack of a bedroom here and I don't want to you know judge your house too much I just bedroom challenge and there's seven rooms in here that are not bedrooms
[250:05.23]I'll sleep on the couch.
[250:06.99]I'll do it.
[250:07.49]I'll do it.
[250:07.91]Look, I may have miscalculated the size of the living room.
[250:10.88]I had a beautiful kitchen, let me tell you.
[250:13.00]I saw you start by placing a bed.
[250:15.29]What happened to it?
[250:17.53]I don't know.
[250:18.07]I decided that I didn't want the bed anymore.
[250:20.01]I was like, the bed, I'm just sleeping in the yoga studio.
[250:22.66]I'm going back to the Earth.
[250:25.28]I want to lay flat on my back in a flat ground like Snoopy.
[250:31.84]and that's my house that's great thank you so much okay you are five minutes over your show time but we move on uh where should we go from here should we just go right to right to stands oh let's do it alright stands let's go what do you what do you uh yeah don't worry about these roofs these were defensive roofs uh the rocks those are placed here by a nosy neighbor we are going to take a step inside nothing cozier than grandma's Seaside cottage oh I can't open the door someone in there
[250:59.77]Wait, it just opened.
[251:00.71]Can't even open the door.
[251:01.37]Can't even open the door.
[251:02.32]That's points off.
[251:03.58]Hey, hey, hey.
[251:04.44]Stands.
[251:05.06]Stands.
[251:05.30]Yeah, write that down.
[251:06.50]I think there's a rock.
[251:07.61]I think this rock is preventing everything.
[251:10.39]Come right around here.
[251:11.93]We do have a beautiful double door with ocean view.
[251:15.92]This is how I want to wake up in the morning.
[251:18.05]Oh, it's pretty.
[251:18.97]And this is just what a comfy cottage.
[251:21.55]Now, at one point, it did have a roof.
[251:23.23]At one point, all the walls were painted.
[251:25.40]At one point, I was happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise.
[251:29.12]I did my best to try and do something.
[251:32.25]If you're real to what you're saying, at one point, I don't know, man.
[251:37.59]All I have left, my lamp, my phone, my stuffed animals that light up, by the way.
[251:43.02]And honestly, my corn.
[251:46.29]So where do you shit?
[251:47.19]It was the ocean.
[251:50.19]The open sea?
[251:52.06]You want me to hover dump in the ocean?
[251:55.40]No, not hover dump.
[251:56.38]Obviously you're not training for a survivor like me.
[251:58.63]It's called an aqua dump.
[251:59.79]You go in and you let it rip.
[252:02.09]That is a harsh punishment on the environment of planet Earth there.
[252:07.12]I'll tell you, the fish love it.
[252:09.04]Okay.
[252:10.00]Anything else to see, or have we seen pretty much it?
[252:12.26]I mean, there's a kitchenette.
[252:13.31]We call it comfy, a little bit of a step saver.
[252:16.11]This is a scale replica of my yacht, but I really, I bring it here.
[252:19.71]Sometimes it's in the harbor, but it's not.
[252:21.84]And you know what?
[252:22.66]A bed big enough for two in case you can pull.
[252:24.44]Not me, though.
[252:26.68]There's a lot of rocks, though.
[252:28.18]There's a lot of rocks.
[252:29.58]Okay, I will say I deleted 70 rocks, and it takes four effort to get them out, and so I decided not to delete the rest of the rocks, but that's the cottage.
[252:38.32]You had a nice little stonehenge in there.
[252:40.64]Yeah, you can do your demon rituals here if you need to.
[252:44.17]Well, any further questions for the judges?
[252:46.84]Well, I didn't know how to attack it.
[252:48.36]Oh, they did!
[252:49.48]I actually spent my entire time running around fixing it.
[252:53.03]I fucked this place up royally.
[252:56.36]And I don't know how he did all this.
[252:57.48]I had to rebuild the cabinets, chairs, and bed every time because people just came through and sold everything.
[253:00.95]And rent fell sweet.
[253:03.26]Yeah, that was malicious.
[253:05.01]I wonder who did that.
[253:06.27]It was a bit malicious.
[253:07.95]I'm going to say I like the extra points for the rug matching the bed.
[253:11.60]I think that's a very simple color coordination.
[253:13.78]Yeah, no, it's very pretty.
[253:16.25]Yeah, we used to have a different bed and rug that still matched, but we couldn't find them in time.
[253:20.30]So I went with the old giraffe print.
[253:22.97]I will say, walking around this house barefoot is gonna really mess up your arches.
[253:28.62]There are a lot of landmines in here.
[253:32.26]Oh, and you know something that people haven't called out?
[253:33.91]This is actual carpet.
[253:35.03]Most people just concrete floors.
[253:37.25]Took the time, laid out some white suede carpet.
[253:40.54]Just remember that, folks.
[253:41.70]Very pretty.
[253:42.30]It's very pretty.
[253:42.92]I like your carpet.
[253:43.88]It's almost like the kind of thing that you'd want on the floor of like a yoga room or something so that it doesn't hurt your back quite as much.
[253:52.09]It's more cooling on the body.
[253:54.98]You're gonna get a lot of sand in that carpet.
[253:57.08]I will say it's filthy because there's no bathroom.
[253:59.41]Stan's yours seems a little bit more comfy.
[254:01.85]Jerma's got a whole like barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen kind of vibe.
[254:05.42]Yeah, well you're also a contestant so it doesn't matter what you say.
[254:10.07]I'm going to go Fortnite house.
[254:13.31]Alright.
[254:13.53]Are we ready to do Duck Ducks house?
[254:15.03]Where are we dropping, boys?
[254:16.94]Now, I saw something.
[254:19.16]Alright.
[254:20.66]Hold on.
[254:21.26]First off, when I moved into this neighborhood, I saw to my right over there, my neighbor taking dumps out in the open ocean and realized it stinks.
[254:27.93]So I'm going to build up a little bit.
[254:29.75]I started by building staircases.
[254:31.21]You follow me up here, Jerma.
[254:32.41]And I just got out of the stink up to the cloud district where, you know, someone of my stature belongs.
[254:37.58]Same with you, real estate agents who have to be judging this.
[254:40.06]So if you come over here, you're going to notice some defensive roofs.
[254:42.94]This is a tactic by the Romans.
[254:46.55]Gaius Marius was famous using this against the Cimbri in 104 BC.
[254:52.47]And so you might be thinking, this doesn't look very livable.
[254:54.64]This looks terrible.
[254:55.40]I don't want to be anywhere near this.
[254:56.48]And that, in fact, is the trick.
[254:57.92]Because I built a secret bedroom back here, which is... Someone sold the door.
[255:02.71]I built a secret open-air bedroom back here.
[255:05.19]Well, you'll notice there is a toilet here.
[255:06.97]And a bath.
[255:08.33]And a bed.
[255:08.96]And a cabinet.
[255:09.96]And yes, that is carpet.
[255:11.62]With a concrete colored rug.
[255:15.02]I really love the multi-function you've got going there.
[255:17.27]Because you flush the toilet and then the liquid from the toilet will clean your bed.
[255:20.81]You don't even have to do any laundry or anything like that on your sheets.
[255:24.50]The plumbing a bit.
[255:26.36]I'm curious how the plumbing works.
[255:28.25]It just goes straight down.
[255:29.71]It's just a hole.
[255:30.33]And that's the thing.
[255:30.85]You don't have to deal with the consequences because you are living up in the cloud district.
[255:34.39]And I want to point out, even if you're wondering about the structural integrity of this house, there is a pole that supports the entire bedroom.
[255:40.59]Oh, is there?
[255:41.01]Yeah, can we see that?
[255:41.71]What?!
[255:42.23]!
[255:43.14]It's like, you know, it's magnets.
[255:56.18]Oh, yeah.
[255:57.30]Yeah, that's magnets.
[255:59.04]Yeah, so earthquakes wouldn't break it.
[256:00.45]Yeah, I think I can see the magnets right there.
[256:01.93]That's smart.
[256:02.97]It's Wi-Fi connected.
[256:03.89]Bluetooth.
[256:06.48]The house does need to be plugged in, yes, but...
[256:09.95]And really, I think we stuck the landing there.
[256:11.79]Thank you so much for checking out my home.
[256:14.40]There's not a single piece that is touching the ground.
[256:19.15]My thoughts are one of these stairs.
[256:20.45]One of these stairs for sure.
[256:21.47]My favorite part about this, Doug, is I believe this is where you started to build something.
[256:26.72]Is this your name?
[256:29.38]That's D-Face in chat.
[256:31.27]It was their response to your build.
[256:34.59]Okay.
[256:36.14]That's rough.
[256:37.48]Alright.
[256:37.76]Looks like a sideways sus guy.
[256:39.91]Moving on.
[256:41.03]This is Nandre's house?
[256:43.03]Nandre.
[256:44.13]Wow, what a mess.
[256:45.37]So do we just go through the toilet forest, or what's the best way to go?
[256:48.64]Absolutely.
[256:49.42]Get your machetes out, because I'm not here to truss up a turkey and tell you you're having a prime rib, okay?
[256:56.27]This house is all about...
[256:58.75]What you see as a graveyard of toilets and dumpsters, I see as a microbrewery.
[257:07.60]That's right.
[257:08.58]Inside each of these dumpsters is your favorite hazy IPA.
[257:13.89]You know, a mango sour.
[257:16.21]I'm brewing it up here.
[257:17.95]And these toilets, they're actually high-tech Korean water fountains that will deliver this delicious alcohol straight to your gullets.
[257:28.74]Wait, so you don't have a bathroom.
[257:30.76]Hold on.
[257:32.17]Maintenance is very, very high for my brewery.
[257:36.19]As you can see, I have quite a few tanks here to take care of.
[257:40.66]So I actually have a living quarters on the premises here in the back if you want to come and visit.
[257:46.66]Good thinking.
[257:47.44]hidden away from all of these earthly delights is my little hobbit hole I've got a kitchenette one cup to taste these delicious beverages a nice 90s kind of aesthetic rug here we also went with the suede floors I had a fireplace here in the middle to give a little gravitas to the space to match the king size bed
[258:14.56]That I'm working on it, okay?
[258:17.18]You could do a fire in there if you're feeling frisky.
[258:19.91]Alright?
[258:21.09]I've got this garbage where I've been sweeping up these bricks from the last time I got hella faded and crashed through this hollow wall.
[258:29.65]Ha!
[258:29.69]And I have a wonderful little yard out here where I do my secret test matches alongside my giant rocks where I can really take in this wonderful view.
[258:40.92]This is a fucking huge awning.
[258:45.83]Only one of you guys made a house.
[258:47.79]Yeah, do you rent this out for like events, like weddings maybe?
[258:51.85]Uh, you know, bar mitzvahs only.
[258:54.08]Okay.
[258:56.74]As a member of the tribe, I gotta respect my people.
[259:00.12]I'll keep it a buck.
[259:01.85]I like a kitchen with an island in it.
[259:04.07]Right?
[259:04.59]It's kind of just like a nice spot to hang out.
[259:08.71]Chomp down a few brews with the boys, right, Sterp?
[259:11.90]I am not a judge.
[259:13.72]But I've judged previously.
[259:15.27]I have judging experience.
[259:18.31]There's no floor here at all.
[259:19.75]It's just grass.
[259:21.17]Are you trying to sway the opinions of the judges right now?
[259:24.08]No, I just have judging experience.
[259:26.18]There's carpet back here.
[259:27.04]To be clear, there's carpet.
[259:28.89]You know, Jeremy, I thought somebody was going to bring up my grass.
[259:33.28]Well, if you swipe your hand across the floor, you'll realize that's not real.
[259:39.31]Artificial astroturf.
[259:41.15]So I don't even have to worry about upkeep.
[259:43.92]It's to ground yourself to this wonderful big blue floating ball in the universe.
[259:51.67]Nandri, how did you even build this many walls?
[259:54.19]This place is huge.
[259:56.56]I spent the whole first 15 minutes building a bunch of walls to distract you guys from my home in the back.
[260:02.98]Oh my god, that's funny.
[260:05.29]Alright, well.
[260:07.19]How are the judges feeling?
[260:12.59]Eclectic?
[260:16.00]We've been talking in the other Discord.
[260:17.40]Do you guys have a number grade for each one and then we can tally it up?
[260:22.13]That works, yeah, if you guys want to give a letter grade for each one and whoever has the highest grade wins.
[260:26.84]The jury must deliberate.
[260:28.58]Yeah, deliberate if you have to.
[260:30.08]Here, why don't we, in the meantime, why don't we build a little viewing area?
[260:34.10]A little judgment area.
[260:37.06]Yeah, that sounds good.
[260:39.05]No one's moving.
[260:40.61]Give me a number.
[260:41.93]B. I'll give a number for Jermas.
[260:45.51]Oh.
[260:46.31]Oh, hold on.
[260:48.26]You're the only one in.
[260:49.46]Poke's just alone with us.
[260:55.75]Man, that last Sabotage really owned me.
[260:59.53]Yeah, you had that James Bond villain thing where you said the plan.
[261:03.64]I thought it was every five minutes!
[261:06.56]Yeah, honestly, it's fair.
[261:10.17]Okay.
[261:10.63]A little judging area here to view.
[261:14.07]How we doing?
[261:15.59]What's my grade?
[261:16.45]Let's go around the table.
[261:18.38]They left us in this game.
[261:20.40]Oh, they left us.
[261:21.06]They're actually deliberating.
[261:22.42]Yeah, they're deliberating.
[261:25.38]Let's maybe get a few chairs.
[261:27.62]I gotta say, they're all pretty shit.
[261:30.68]Yeah, the destruction was quite tough.
[261:32.85]Ooh, I got an idea.
[261:33.41]How about rocking chairs?
[261:34.77]Stans, your house is... Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[261:37.33]I'll get a little table.
[261:38.65]Stans, I think you won.
[261:39.82]I mean, I think the... I just went small because I was like, well, it's going to be so hard to fix anything.
[261:44.10]I mean, but you have a... You ended up with a totally coherent...
[261:49.73]This is a room that is done.
[261:52.93]Look, you've got the lamp here.
[261:54.57]You've got the, I don't know man, this is gonna be tough.
[261:57.98]I think you got it.
[262:01.08]I wish I didn't add the anime wallpaper.
[262:03.39]I was looking for any art to just make it look like something and it just takes away from everything.
[262:09.55]There is a certain je ne sais quoi if you win your own competition though, Jeremy.
[262:15.97]It would call into question everything that has happened these past two weeks.
[262:22.04]Well, we had nine confirmed for today.
[262:25.76]Seven showed up?
[262:27.80]I'm filling.
[262:31.43]If I won this, it would have just gone to the next person.
[262:34.71]Has anyone seen these missing people?
[262:39.70]Wait, wait, don't wall it off.
[262:40.74]That way we can look around at the houses while we're...
[262:43.48]what we're judging.
[262:44.47]Alright, let's bring this down.
[262:48.81]It was like our viewing platform, you know?
[262:52.23]That was such a great idea.
[262:54.93]We all had great strategies.
[262:57.44]I took so long to get up there because I was building individual walls.
[263:02.92]And then once we realized you could just warp with rooms.
[263:07.37]Because that first whole sabotage round, I was desperately trying to get to.
[263:12.75]And I failed.
[263:13.94]Your plan worked.
[263:16.38]It was a great setup.
[263:19.08]But I've played enough build mode in my life to know that there's always a way.
[263:25.95]You know?
[263:28.72]It's still deliberating.
[263:29.62]I wonder what they're saying.
[263:31.02]Oh!
[263:32.32]Oh!
[263:32.86]Oh, there they are.
[263:33.34]You guys ready?
[263:33.72]We've talked a lot about this.
[263:37.35]Mm-hmm.
[263:37.51]And collectively as a group, a group consisting of me, Poke, Ryken, Ster, Limelicious...
[263:47.77]We put our heads together, really worked this shit out.
[263:52.49]It was tough.
[263:53.61]We're going to give everyone a zero, but Stan's with a 10.
[263:56.72]Let's go!
[264:02.36]You guys did great, though.
[264:03.60]All around.
[264:04.84]Can I say something, actually?
[264:06.83]I think we shouldn't have even gone on to round two.
[264:08.55]I think if Will, Neff, and Cutie didn't have to go, that house was beautiful.
[264:12.61]But I'm happy to be here.
[264:14.47]What was that, like a year ago?
[264:15.61]I can't remember.
[264:16.69]Yeah, it was a long time ago.
[264:17.59]It was like six months ago.
[264:18.91]Yeah, so you know what?
[264:20.69]Take it out of my memory.
[264:21.77]It feels good to be here.
[264:23.05]Thank you, Jerma.
[264:23.80]Thank you, judges.
[264:25.06]Stans, congratulations.
[264:26.96]You have won the House Flipper Invitational 3.
[264:32.74]Well done.
[264:34.25]So wait, I get a miniature house?
[264:35.31]Is that what we're talking about?
[264:36.23]Everyone's getting a miniature house, but Stans, hold on.
[264:39.81]Stans, you are getting...
[264:44.55]a DLC code to the Scooby-Doo DLC for House Clicker.
[264:53.67]Oh my god!
[264:53.89]Zoinks!
[264:55.05]Dude, feels so freaking good, man.
[264:58.56]Sorry, was I not muted?
[265:00.58]Sorry.
[265:01.02]And, Stans, and you're also going to get
[265:11.01]a sledgehammer with a wooden handle with an engraving of your Twitch name.
[265:17.11]Dude, that's amazing.
[265:17.83]Wait, that's actually badass.
[265:18.51]That's so cool.
[265:20.72]That's super cool.
[265:21.88]And I'm taking it to Nandre's house and we're breaking some walls.
[265:25.19]And, Stans, also, Jerma is buying you a property in the current real estate market that is equivalent to your final house.
[265:37.34]A whole entire house.
[265:39.10]A real house on his dime.
[265:46.17]So generous.
[265:46.43]So generous.
[265:46.69]I was considering spray painting the top of the Sledgehammer Gold.
[265:52.32]I actually prefer that.
[265:54.21]I would like the gold sledgehammer.
[265:56.85]Yeah, that's going to be it.
[265:59.25]How long?
[266:00.19]Four hours!
[266:00.84]Dude, look at this!
[266:01.50]Record time!
[266:02.16]That was a clean four hours.
[266:03.58]That was good.
[266:05.68]But yes, record time.
[266:06.84]Yeah, it takes me four hours to clean myself.
[266:13.15]Perfect.
[266:13.63]Well, thank you all.
[266:14.32]Thank you again, Jerma.
[266:15.28]Thanks, guys.
[266:16.58]It's a multi-day thing.
[266:17.50]I know you guys committed a lot of time to this, so...
[266:19.86]Huge thank you to everybody.
[266:21.17]All 24 of you.
[266:22.47]I know that some of them aren't here.
[266:25.30]We only have 12 people move on, but those of you that were here today, great shit.
[266:29.30]Awesome job.
[266:29.91]Thanks to everybody.
[266:31.57]Thank you for inviting.
[266:34.20]It was great to have you guys.
[266:35.96]I'll be in touch
[266:37.58]about your little miniature.
[266:40.89]Give me a little time, though, because these are going to get custom made.
[266:44.15]Oh, yeah.
[266:45.47]I assume it'll take forever.
[266:46.55]It will probably take into the summer.
[266:48.64]Oh, is that why you wanted us to send the maps at the end of the first day?
[266:53.26]It is.
[266:54.80]Wait, does that mean you're going to make my kit?
[266:56.45]It's okay, because I made sure to get total coverage.
[267:01.45]So we got plenty of opportunity to get whatever it is you made.
[267:06.10]out there.
[267:06.52]And again, that will be your first house you made.
[267:10.67]Oh, okay, okay.
[267:11.53]That's awesome.
[267:13.27]I'm excited.
[267:14.61]Man, thank you so much.
[267:16.93]Thank you.
[267:17.53]Thank you, Jerma.
[267:20.12]Great job, everyone.
[267:21.24]Thank you.
[267:22.28]Nice to meet you all.
[267:25.90]Bye.
[267:28.62]Bye.
[267:32.29]Alright, that is it.
[267:34.21]And that's going to be the stream too.
[267:36.57]That was great.
[267:37.12]I had a lot of fun.
[267:37.92]I'm happy that at least... Because this round here, this was always going to be the final.
[267:46.02]And I was really hoping we were going to get through everything in like at least that second round, two or three hours.
[267:53.37]Because if we had gotten like four or five hours and it was round two still, I was like, shit, man, are we going to be able to do the little bonus finale?
[268:00.60]So...
[268:02.02]Hope you had a good time.
[268:02.95]Hope you had fun.
[268:04.43]It's obviously thanks to House Flipper.
[268:06.35]The House Flipper devs were a big part of this.
[268:09.03]They sponsored this whole thing.
[268:12.23]So yeah, I'm really happy about that.
[268:14.06]So thank you, House Flipper.
[268:16.02]Had a great time.
[268:17.68]And yeah, that's going to be it.
[268:19.12]I'll see you guys.
[268:19.82]I think I'm streaming tomorrow.
[268:23.78]I think we're going to get the boys together and do something tomorrow.
[268:27.61]If not, then we'll see.
[268:28.65]But I think that's the plan.
[268:30.56]I will see you guys later.
[268:31.80]Thanks a lot.
[268:32.48]Have a great one.
[268:34.42]And we can do a little outro here.
[268:40.83]Oh, I don't have, my like video isn't there.
[268:46.16]That's okay.
[268:46.62]You get the picture.
[268:51.16]Yeah, I, that was great.
[268:52.58]I had a great time.
[268:55.97]Having people commit this much to this and... I mean, it's a lot of work.
[269:00.46]It is.
[269:02.16]You have to really... It's a lot of brain power.
[269:05.67]It's a lot of the time constraint, so... Huge thank you to everybody that decided to come.
[269:14.18]I can put the music on.
[269:16.76]And the crackling seemed to have stopped a little during that, so I'm happy about that, too.
[269:21.33]Hey, it all worked out.
[269:27.53]Um, hold on.
[269:33.70]Hold on.
[269:40.77]A, where is it?
[269:50.56]Where is it?
[269:51.82]I just recently moved.
[269:56.08]There it is.
[270:05.80]Hey, just pretend that the theater is there.
[270:10.15]I moved a bunch of stuff around.
[270:11.81]I'll see you guys later.
[270:12.53]Thank you.
[270:13.37]Huge, huge, huge awesome time.
[270:16.43]I had a great time.
[270:17.74]I know I've said that like 10 times, but... Have a wonderful rest of your night, evening, afternoon.
[270:25.12]And again, I'll be in contact with everybody over the next few weeks.
[270:29.09]Getting your houses.
[270:31.07]Your little miniatures.
[270:35.94]Take care.
[270:37.30]See you later.
[270:39.15]Have a good one.
[271:28.84]you
