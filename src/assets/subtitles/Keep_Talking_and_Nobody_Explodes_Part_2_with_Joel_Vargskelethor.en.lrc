[05:39.79]Alright, let's see if he's around.
[05:43.05]You good?
[05:45.03]Hopefully he can still see the screen.
[05:54.84]I'm calling him right now.
[05:56.04]Let's see if he picks up.
[06:01.02]Let's see if he picks up the phone.
[06:06.80]Hello?
[06:08.34]Hello?
[06:08.84]Is anybody there?
[06:12.44]I've been earning your Jerma coins.
[06:19.05]Well, the webcam will be on for a lot of the stream, so I'll be able to wink at you.
[06:24.78]He ignored the questions about Nancy Drew.
[06:30.68]Well, what do you want me to say?
[06:34.17]Yes, I will go back to Nancy Drew eventually.
[06:37.90]Probably not today.
[06:38.48]Same shirt as yesterday.
[06:41.34]The shirt yesterday was green.
[06:43.78]This is blue.
[06:45.08]This is a blue shirt?
[06:48.12]I don't think yesterday's shirt was green.
[06:50.66]Somebody's linked that person a clip, please.
[06:56.44]Hey.
[06:56.62]That just actually scared the shit out of me.
[06:59.67]Hey!
[07:01.15]How you doing?
[07:03.64]I'm doing good.
[07:04.28]You ready to... ready to defuse some bombs?
[07:07.08]I'm ready to defuse some bombs.
[07:09.44]Okay.
[07:09.68]So I was just... I was just giving the intro spiel here at the start, but I said this before.
[07:13.58]You know, last time we did this, it was... it was a bit of a... bit of a challenge because we'd never played this game before and we quickly realized that reading instructions while also timed on it and having people, you know, tell you what to do, it can be quite... quite the challenge.
[07:32.20]It's tricky.
[07:34.26]Did you squad up?
[07:35.72]Did you squad up?
[07:36.92]Oh, I gotta squad up.
[07:37.88]Hang on.
[07:38.46]I'm gonna squad up.
[07:42.44]People can see both screens.
[07:44.98]There we go.
[07:46.20]Alright, so, um, big question.
[07:48.76]Before we do this... Alright, first bomb!
[07:50.95]Let's go!
[07:52.27]I'm just kidding.
[07:52.69]I'm kidding.
[07:52.99]I'm kidding.
[07:53.23]You don't have to... I'm just kidding.
[07:54.61]Um, no, I was gonna say, um... This is more from my chat, really, but would you guys prefer that, um...
[08:02.19]I'm not gonna tell you.
[08:02.81]I put up the... I put up the... the manual on screen.
[08:06.12]Or, uh... Just again, because I... I... I... I'm gonna be reading the manual on my phone.
[08:12.38]Yes.
[08:12.68]Oh, you're gonna... Wait, you're reading it on your... You're reading it on your phone?
[08:16.68]Yeah, because I thought, like, well, I don't really have a piece of paper.
[08:19.06]This is the closest thing, you know?
[08:20.66]Who reads these days?
[08:22.80]That's gonna be so small.
[08:24.58]You're gonna be, like, scrolling through.
[08:26.64]You're gonna do a microscope.
[08:28.07]We got one white wire, two white wires.
[08:30.78]Listen, big letters scare me, alright?
[08:33.96]So, the tighter the better, you know?
[08:35.63]You're going to have trouble reading that shit.
[08:40.29]I'm going to be fine.
[08:41.41]I'm going to be fine.
[08:42.09]Pull up a PDF.
[08:44.89]What do you want?
[08:47.09]Do you want to start easy?
[08:48.45]Because this is the first time you've read, right?
[08:51.92]This is the first time I've read, yes.
[08:53.36]Okay.
[08:54.58]We'll start easy.

[12:39.51]I'm not saying I'm going to be fucking looking at the screen.
[12:43.67]Alright, so can you see the screen?
[12:45.01]Like just you?
[12:47.24]Can you see it?
[12:49.36]I can see the mouse moving around, but I cannot see anything.
[12:52.14]You can't see anything?
[12:52.92]Is this black screen for you?
[12:54.72]Yes, yes, but I see the mouse.
[12:56.41]I tried.

[13:11.88]Let me see what's going on.
[13:14.20]People are talking about squad streaming here, and it's not working out, I think.
[13:17.48]Hold on.
[13:18.16]Squad stream.
[13:19.46]Did that work?
[13:21.30]It should be working.
[13:24.34]No, it says we're in a squad with Varg Skeletor.
[13:29.78]That is working on Twitch.
[13:30.70]Oh, my God.
[13:31.06]This is, like, more hard than actually fusing a bomb.
[13:35.02]Okay, yes, all that is working, but the screen that I'm looking at right now, I only see a mouse and nothing else.
[13:41.86]Really?
[13:42.16]Yeah.
[13:44.31]Can you do window capture?
[13:47.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[13:48.89]I see the overlay of Steam and everything, but there's nothing on the screen.
[13:52.77]Tell you what, do you want to just, what do you call it, re-invite me to a new game, perhaps?
[13:58.03]Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's try that.

[18:32.05]And dumbfuck has never played Half-Life.
[18:33.81]Alright, yeah, dumbfuck.
[18:35.01]Oh my god, it's the Half-Life symbol!
[18:39.01]Okay, we got a button.
[18:39.90]We have a button.
[18:41.48]It is a blue button.
[18:44.18]Are you sure there's nothing on the back?
[18:46.52]Okay, there's nothing on the back, but there is a serial number here.
[18:50.16]Okay, let's not worry about that.
[18:51.83]Let's get to the point here.
[18:53.03]What color is the button?
[18:54.33]The button is blue, and it says press.
[18:57.43]That's it.
[18:58.17]Blue button that says press.
[19:01.17]How many batteries do we have?
[19:02.05]We have... How many batteries?
[19:04.09]There are no... There are one battery.
[19:07.82]There's one battery.
[19:08.62]There's one battery.
[19:10.20]There are three batteries.
[19:12.06]There are three... Oh, okay.
[19:13.74]And the button said abort?
[19:16.06]Uh, the button says press.
[19:17.99]Okay, uh... Three batteries, the button says press, and it is blue.
[19:23.11]Does it say FRK somewhere on the bomb?
[19:25.45]Uh, does it say... It says there's FRQ on the bottom.
[19:29.26]No, it says FRK.
[19:30.96]No, there's no FRK.
[19:34.60]Just hold down the button for me.
[19:36.30]Hold the button down.
[19:38.54]What color?
[19:39.74]It's just blue.
[19:40.36]And there's a thing on the right that's blinking just blue.
[19:44.00]Okay, release it when it says 4 in any position.
[19:48.04]We did it!
[19:51.52]There was a 4 at the beginning.
[19:54.02]Alright, I can't believe I didn't do the Half-Life thing.
[19:56.00]I can't believe it.
[19:58.11]I sat there for so long, I cannot fucking believe it.
[20:02.37]We learn through... We're learning about things, you know?
[20:08.40]I'm learning about Bostonians, and you're learning about Half-Life.
[20:12.08]I can't believe it.
[20:12.90]That's worse than Omega.
[20:14.46]I just get locked out of my own brain.
[20:16.84]Alright.
[20:18.24]Alright.
[20:21.19]We'll go from here.
[20:23.11]We're gonna do double your money.
[20:24.13]We did this left.
[20:24.73]Okay.
[20:25.37]Mm-hmm.
[20:25.73]Okay.
[20:26.01]That sounds good.
[20:26.69]Half-Life symbol.
[20:27.65]What an embarrassment.
[20:28.49]Alright.
[20:28.81]Double your money.
[20:29.27]You ready to go?
[20:29.87]Just keep it rolling?
[20:30.71]I'm ready to go, man.
[20:31.51]I'm ready to go.
[20:32.15]Alright.
[20:33.59]I'm gonna be ready.
[20:34.47]This time, I'm not gonna... This is lightning in.
[20:38.19]Alright.
[20:39.49]We can do this, man.
[20:41.11]We have to trust each other.
[20:42.85]I'm not gonna do any bullshit because that leads to explosions.
[20:46.42]We have to do this.
[20:48.06]Here we go.
[20:49.44]Three wires.
[20:50.02]Yes.
[20:51.60]You have three wires.
[20:52.50]Alright.
[20:53.12]One yellow, one blue, one red.
[20:55.80]Yellow, blue, red.
[20:57.10]That's it.
[20:58.54]So the... We do have a red wire.
[21:01.68]There's one red wire.
[21:02.50]Is the last wire white?
[21:03.75]The last wire is red.
[21:07.45]Cut the last wire.
[21:09.59]Good.
[21:10.29]Symbols.
[21:12.09]Omega symbol.
[21:13.41]Omega symbol.
[21:15.53]A-E.
[21:16.35]Yes.
[21:18.82]Somebody had stitches.
[21:19.68]Somebody had stitches, and they have a cut.
[21:22.00]It's like a Frankenstein stitches.
[21:24.21]And then a... H, but the line is going from top right to bottom left.
[21:31.23]It's like an H. Gotcha, gotcha.
[21:34.99]We will be looking at stitches.
[21:38.92]A, E. Weird-ass H. Omega.
[21:43.96]Omega.
[21:44.61]okay now we have we have two buttons there are two blue buttons they both are the same exact button it's a blue button that says press both of them are the same two blue buttons that say press gotcha gotcha there's gonna be some things that factor into this though so we gotta be careful but I'm gonna look through the manual here and see what we can deduct from this um uh how many batteries do we have on this bomb
[22:08.75]There are one... There is one battery on this bomb.
[22:13.85]Only one.
[22:15.73]Only one bomb.
[22:16.49]Okay.
[22:20.69]And the... It said press on it.
[22:22.74]Yeah.
[22:23.04]Both buttons say press.
[22:24.50]They're both blue.
[22:25.38]Okay.
[22:26.34]Okay.
[22:26.60]Here we go.
[22:27.34]We're going to be holding this down.
[22:28.34]Okay.
[22:30.64]Hold the button down.
[22:31.26]Okay.
[22:34.08]I have a red blink.
[22:35.64]It's blinking red.
[22:38.99]It's blink.
[22:39.65]One in any position.
[22:40.43]One in any position.
[22:41.19]One in any position.
[22:42.05]Okay, you got it.
[22:42.85]Yes.
[22:43.03]I have to wait, because I have to wait until he gets to a one.
[22:48.25]Okay.
[22:48.87]What about the second button?
[22:49.77]If there's, yeah, if there's some, completely duplicate, do the same procedure.
[22:54.39]Okay.
[22:54.95]Red again.
[22:55.35]Is this one in any position?
[22:57.33]One in any position.
[22:57.97]Okay.
[22:58.41]Alright.
[22:58.87]I have to wait ten seconds.
[23:04.99]I hope, I hope I did this right.
[23:06.09]What's your favorite pizza?
[23:08.77]Alright, now... We have... There are... Okay, we got... We got more symbols.
[23:15.41]Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine.
[23:16.51]We can do symbols.
[23:17.31]Okay, we've got, uh, backwards P. Smiley face with the tongue sticking out.
[23:20.84]Okay.
[23:21.96]Uh, upside... The T... The T... TB thing, and then a trident.
[23:28.54]Okay, uh, we got a smiley face... TB thing, TB thing.
[23:30.84]Smiley face, trident, TB, and backwards TB.
[23:35.09]Okay, in that order?
[23:37.06]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:38.00]Okay.
[23:38.96]The order will be Trident.
[23:42.38]Yep.
[23:42.92]Mr. Smiley.
[23:43.80]Yep.
[23:46.11]Weird TB.
[23:47.21]Weird TB.
[23:48.59]Got it.
[23:48.81]Yes.
[23:49.15]And then, yes, the last one.
[23:50.15]Okay, cool.
[23:50.39]The final module, we have plenty of time, so don't worry.
[23:52.27]Just relax.
[23:53.05]Okay, okay.
[23:53.49]It's another wire module.
[23:55.77]We have one, two, three, four.
[23:57.99]There are five wires.
[24:00.59]Two of those wires are yellow.
[24:02.79]Two of those wires are red.
[24:04.46]One of them is white.
[24:06.18]Two yellow, two red, one white.
[24:09.26]There are five of them.
[24:13.56]Is there any black wires here?
[24:15.06]There are no black wires.
[24:17.46]And we have a total of five here.
[24:19.01]There are five wires, two yellow, two red, one white.
[24:23.17]Cut the first wire.
[24:25.21]That was incorrect.
[24:27.93]Uh...
[24:29.23]We're even them real quick again.
[24:30.19]I got really stressed out.
[24:30.91]Sorry.
[24:31.07]Alright.
[24:31.65]Two yellow, two red, one white.
[24:35.95]There are five.
[24:36.81]Two yellow wires.
[24:37.93]There are two red wires and one white wire.
[24:41.17]That's it.
[24:41.61]Cut the second wire.
[24:42.51]My bad.
[24:42.95]My bad.
[24:43.31]We got it.
[24:43.85]Look at that.
[24:46.43]I sort of freak out.
[24:47.35]Like, here comes the bomb demons in my head.
[24:51.21]Like, come on, dude.
[24:51.99]Just tell them anyway.
[24:52.81]I'm like, no, we have to commit to this.
[24:53.95]Alright.
[24:56.45]I think we're doing alright.
[24:58.36]We're doing alright.
[24:58.98]We're doing alright.
[25:01.19]But that's because I disciplined myself before the stream and I said, okay, maybe I shouldn't be devolving the stream into just like making fun of Jeremiah's lack of Greek symbols for like three hours.
[25:11.48]So...
[25:14.14]Well, we didn't know what we were doing last time.
[25:15.84]You gotta give us some credit.
[25:18.54]The last time we played this, that was the first time we've ever even seen the manual.
[25:22.78]We didn't know how the game even worked.
[25:24.72]We had two chances.
[25:26.59]Be honest, we probably were both streaming for ten fucking years now.
[25:29.45]Do we know what we're doing still?
[25:35.95]No.
[25:36.15]Next level.
[25:37.63]Alright, this one.
[25:38.59]How did it take us this long to do this last time?
[25:43.25]I think it was because I was screaming and we had some issues.
[25:47.43]But anyway, let's go, man.
[25:49.07]This one, we got to be careful.
[25:49.91]This one is three minutes.
[25:52.72]Alright.
[25:52.98]But as long as we coordinated and we're not screaming.
[25:57.54]Alright.
[26:00.56]Relax.
[26:01.16]Just relax.
[26:01.80]We're just having a good time here.
[26:02.84]Relax.
[26:03.24]Relax.
[26:03.76]It's just a bomb.
[26:05.90]And, you know, 3,000 people screaming at you.
[26:07.75]It's okay.
[26:09.57]It's fine.
[26:10.09]Okay.
[26:12.72]are you ready I'm ready we have uh I believe this is Simon says with colors okay that's fine that's fine we have red it blinked red okay read me the whatever let's let's do Simon says first alright I've never okay so um what are we looking at here
[26:32.40]We're looking at, it's red, red is the first one, it's blinked red.
[26:37.91]Before we do this, we need to check if there's a vowel on the bomb.
[26:40.73]Okay, vowel on the bomb, you got it.
[26:43.77]There is not, wait, vowel on the serial number or just on the bomb in general?
[26:48.43]The serial, yes.
[26:50.06]Okay, there is not a vowel on this bomb.
[26:52.92]Let's go back to Simon Says.
[26:54.30]Okay.
[26:57.12]Okay, red.
[26:57.70]Red.
[27:00.92]Uh, you're gonna go blue.
[27:03.88]Okay.
[27:07.46]Red, green.
[27:10.92]Blue, green.
[27:11.40]Okay.
[27:17.51]Red, green, green.
[27:21.41]Blue, green, green.
[27:29.03]Red, green, green, red.
[27:33.93]Blue, green, green, red.
[27:36.24]Blue, green, green, blue.
[27:37.20]Sorry.
[27:41.64]Jesus.
[27:42.22]Okay, hold on.
[27:45.84]Red, green, green, red, blue.
[27:50.84]Blue, green, green, blue, yellow.
[27:53.87]Was it red, green, green, red, blue?
[27:57.99]Red, green, green, red, blue.
[28:03.37]So, red, green, green, red, blue.
[28:05.81]Then you'll be looking at... No, no, no.
[28:07.85]I'm sorry.
[28:08.23]No, no, no.
[28:08.71]I was like reading the map.
[28:09.68]Okay.
[28:10.36]Stop freaking out.
[28:11.26]Okay.
[28:11.46]Hang on.
[28:12.08]You'll be looking at blue, green, green, blue, yellow.
[28:15.78]That's illusion.
[28:16.58]What's happening?
[28:18.68]Blue?
[28:19.00]Oh, my God.
[28:21.68]Jerma, I'm sorry.
[28:22.62]I'm so sorry.
[28:23.30]I just realized something.
[28:24.72]If we get a strike on the Simon's test, that means the equation is totally different.
[28:30.85]I'm sorry.
[28:31.31]This is the first time I'm fucking reading.
[28:32.79]Okay.
[28:35.49]We're going.
[28:35.77]We're going.
[28:37.93]Okay, look.
[28:39.07]Learning process.
[28:39.69]Learning process.
[28:40.33]My bad.
[28:40.63]That was totally on me.
[28:41.43]Totally on me.
[28:42.02]It gets tricky.
[28:42.62]It gets hard.
[28:43.10]Okay, here we go.
[28:43.62]Ready?
[28:44.20]Okay.
[28:44.76]This time, it's a little different.
[28:46.46]This time, we have... Okay.
[28:48.06]A... Okay, it's the number four.
[28:49.82]It's a screen with a number, and then four numbers underneath.
[28:54.24]Okay, so...
[28:56.50]Okay.
[28:57.36]It's basically memory, essentially.
[28:58.84]Yeah.
[28:59.16]Yes.
[28:59.73]It's a memory game, and you have to do this five times.
[29:01.77]I remember this one.
[29:03.45]Okay.
[29:03.81]I remember when I did this, I had a lot of problem.
[29:06.17]Yeah.
[29:06.37]It's tricky.
[29:06.69]It's your turn now.
[29:07.11]Ready?
[29:07.63]Alright.
[29:07.99]Inside the screen is the number four.
[29:12.70]Press the button in the fourth position.
[29:14.02]The number is now one.
[29:20.74]Press the button labeled four.
[29:22.32]Labeled four.
[29:26.52]One again.
[29:30.18]Press the button with the same label as you pressed in stage two.
[29:34.03]The same label in stage two?
[29:36.75]Mm-hmm.
[29:37.71]Same label in stage two.
[29:38.79]Same label.
[29:39.41]Okay, that was four.
[29:42.87]Now the number is three.
[29:46.90]Press the button in the same position as you pressed in stage two.
[29:50.46]Four.
[29:50.98]Okay.
[29:51.92]Finally, four.
[29:56.14]Press the button with the same label as it pressed in stage three.
[30:00.12]It was also four.
[30:01.68]Done.
[30:02.18]Good.
[30:02.56]Okay.
[30:03.20]Awesome.
[30:03.42]Now, we've got... We have got a... It's the word... There's a word in the box and then the six other words.
[30:10.91]So, the word is red.
[30:14.03]Okay.
[30:14.21]Hang on.
[30:14.95]This contraption is something like out of a sketch comedy routine.
[30:17.99]Tell me about it.
[30:18.87]Which might be funny if you weren't connected to a bomb.
[30:21.65]I'll keep this brief.
[30:22.65]Okay.
[30:22.83]So read the display in a step one to determine which button label to read.
[30:25.88]Using the button label, use step two to determine which button to push.
[30:29.38]Repeat until the module has been disarmed.
[30:30.80]Okay.
[30:31.02]So what word do we have in the thing?
[30:33.82]The word is red.
[30:36.52]Inside of the box.
[30:37.55]The word is red.
[30:38.43]Read me what is in the middle button to the right.
[30:41.19]Middle to the right.
[30:42.11]The word is right.
[30:45.16]Okay.
[30:45.74]Right.
[30:45.98]Let me see here.
[30:51.19]Uh... Okay.
[30:54.59]I'm gonna spout these out until you see some.
[30:57.59]Okay.
[30:57.77]So here we go.
[30:58.82]Yes.
[30:59.66]Nothing.
[31:00.54]Ready.
[31:01.34]Press.
[31:02.56]I see ready.
[31:03.18]Ready is on here.
[31:03.94]It's the bottom right slot.
[31:05.80]First one.
[31:06.90]Ready.
[31:07.12]Okay.
[31:11.17]Joel, I don't want to alarm you, but... Alright, uh, the word is no.
[31:17.36]Okay, uh, what does it say?
[31:18.92]Uh, you are next.
[31:20.04]Uh-uh, sure, done, hold.
[31:22.28]No, no, no, no, give me the word, give me the word.
[31:23.98]The word is no, the word is no, the word is no.
[31:27.42]Okay, uh... Blank, uh, three letters, uh, wait, first, what?
[31:33.49]Next word?
[31:39.41]Next word?
[31:41.53]Y'all get down.
[31:43.05]How about dead?
[31:49.38]Okay, well, uh, now we deducted how we should do Simon says, and we do that quickly.
[31:54.41]We're quickly learning now that, uh,
[31:57.25]You know, with this reading thing.
[31:59.15]Don't worry.
[31:59.45]Don't worry.
[32:00.21]These are growing steps.
[32:01.19]We did great at the first tier.
[32:02.67]Let's just keep going and hammer this in and eventually we'll be experts.
[32:06.23]But I'm just telling you something.
[32:07.61]Next bomb, we're going to actually be treating as we'll die.
[32:10.64]Yes.
[32:11.60]Next one is so serious.
[32:13.20]We will actually be dying.
[32:14.32]Okay.
[32:15.52]I'm going to take this as if we were going to die.
[32:18.16]We are going to die now.
[32:19.00]Okay.
[32:19.38]Alright.
[32:22.02]Like your life.
[32:23.14]We are going to die.
[32:23.98]Okay.
[32:27.34]Okay, let's go.
[32:29.14]Here we go.
[32:33.17]So, treat this like it was real.
[32:35.41]Yes.
[32:36.43]Okay, okay.
[32:38.97]Yellow, yellow on the Simon Says thing.
[32:40.35]We have three minutes.
[32:41.23]No, no, no.
[32:41.85]Okay.
[32:42.19]Simon Says.
[32:43.49]Okay, okay.
[32:44.25]Hang on.
[32:45.09]Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.
[32:46.50]Please call somebody.
[32:50.28]Call somebody.
[32:52.76]Yellow!
[32:53.56]Okay, let's- let's not go- Okay, whatever, whatever!
[32:56.00]Just read me the fucking serial on the thing!
[32:57.42]Uh... Do we have a vowel on the serial?
[32:59.64]Okay, do we have a vowel?
[33:02.85]There- there- is there- Yes!
[33:05.63]There is a vowel.
[33:07.41]Okay, uh... T-tell me what the first flesh is.
[33:10.81]Yellow.

[35:41.78]We're done.
[35:48.48]Mom, turn the oven off.
[35:50.80]Honestly, don't worry about it because now...
[35:53.95]that Simon says thing was fine we're quickly learning that the uh the it's called who's on first that one is a little difficult for us it is because we have to be very specific because I'm noticing a lot like here's the thing that's very important about this some of these you are there's three variations of you are there's you are without you space are you know whatever uh
[36:17.92]There's possessive, like, you're pizza.
[36:20.82]Yeah, Y-O-U-R, right?
[36:23.02]Y-O-U-R.
[36:23.64]And then there is, you are a pizza, as in, you apostrophe R-E, you know.
[36:30.32]Oh, shit.
[36:31.70]Okay.
[36:32.82]Alright.
[36:33.12]So I'm going to start saying apostrophe.
[36:34.95]I'm going to say possessive, apostrophe, or space on the U. And there's also this different variations on uh, right?
[36:42.45]There's not just uh, there's uh and uh, h, h, h, h. So there's going to be a lot of
[36:49.15]specifics here and we have to be super fucking like talking about this so uh this is this is very bad for me because not I'm not an English speaker you know I don't speak English neither do I so so uh well we're just gonna have to do the best alright but here's the thing here's the thing coordination let's not screw it any every second special for us is vital so now
[37:15.25]The problem was, and alright, I burnt like 20 seconds during the Simon Says, because I tried to do it too fast.
[37:21.27]You can't do, for instance, it was like green, red, red, and you were like, oh, blue, like, yellow, yellow, and I did blue, yellow, yellow, but it doesn't register, you have to go slow.
[37:31.04]Okay, okay, no, I get it, it's stressful, it's stressful, but we can do this, we can do this.
[37:36.26]Okay, I'm ready.
[37:37.92]You ready?
[37:38.32]Okay, here we go.

[44:59.91]Alright, well, that proves that we can do this.
[45:02.23]I think, honestly, this sounds ironic, but I think me being an idiot, I'm actually reading better than actually playing.
[45:08.08]I think we found our groove.
[45:11.40]Yeah, I think so.
[45:12.76]Which we'll shake up later on the stream, mind you, so.
[45:15.40]This is gonna be fun.
[45:17.80]Okay.
[45:19.62]This one, okay, now they're getting harder.
[45:22.36]Okay.
[45:23.18]This one is called A Hidden Message.
[45:25.96]Oh yeah?
[45:26.12]And this is now Moderate Difficulty.
[45:28.74]Okay.
[45:29.32]We do have five minutes for this one.
[45:30.48]What does it say on the screen?
[45:31.68]Uh, information can be obscured in ways that are time-consuming to decode.
[45:36.82]In the world of bomb defusing, that's a bad thing.
[45:39.68]But information can possibly be obscured.
[45:40.92]How many minutes do we have?
[45:41.50]We have five minutes.
[45:43.71]Okay, but that's fine.
[45:44.59]Listen, the last one was so hard, because... We were at, like, two minutes, I think?
[45:50.73]Yeah.
[45:51.29]That was three minutes, yeah.
[45:52.93]That's too little.
[45:53.77]Alright.
[45:54.65]Okay.
[45:55.11]Let's just try it out.
[45:56.39]Let's try it out and see what we got.
[45:58.19]Let's give it a whirl.
[46:00.15]Let's go.
[46:06.97]I'm so fucking nervous.
[46:08.49]I know.
[46:09.51]I think there's only three modules, though.
[46:11.67]Alright, you ready?
[46:13.20]Yep.
[46:14.38]Do a hard blink.
[46:15.72]Here we go.
[46:17.10]We have a new module here.
[46:18.28]It is a Game Boy looking thing that has five letters on it.
[46:23.41]It has five letters, okay.
[46:24.63]It's five letters.
[46:25.23]It looks like a Game Boy.
[46:26.35]And there's arrows on the top and bottom.
[46:28.15]I can switch... I can change the letters.
[46:30.75]It's five letters.
[46:31.45]Okay.
[46:31.63]Well, here's what I'm going to do.
[46:32.73]I'm going to start writing down.
[46:34.43]I think I... Yeah, I see this module.
[46:36.81]This is going to be impossible because I'm going to have to deduct a word from this, alright?
[46:40.18]So, just give me the first letters.
[46:41.54]Okay.
[46:42.90]The letter is A. Okay.
[46:46.40]A-O-K... No, no, no, no, no.
[46:50.14]What?
[46:50.36]So, so, so...
[46:52.77]I'm not saying what's on screen.
[46:54.21]I'm saying cycle through them.
[46:56.25]Oh, okay.
[46:56.49]The first letter has potential to be A, X, O, H, or V, or J. A, X, O. A, X, O, H, V, J. Okay.
[47:12.97]Second ones.
[47:15.29]O, I, B, M, R, Q, R.
[47:21.15]So we're looking O, I, M, Q, almost two letter ones.
[47:25.88]O?
[47:26.72]O?
[47:29.34]O, then?
[47:30.94]O, then what?
[47:33.08]You want the third one?
[47:34.38]The third slot?
[47:35.08]Cycle through the second one.
[47:37.65]Okay, the second one has O, I, B, M, R, and Q. Okay, here we go.
[47:45.65]Read me the third ones.
[47:47.15]K, N.
[47:49.31]Y. O. S. M. K. N. Y. O. S. M. Okay, now I just have to deduct this.
[47:59.76]Okay.
[48:00.06]Let's see here.
[48:01.78]Oh, geez.
[48:02.34]A. A. A. A. A. Can you spell about?

[49:37.60]Right.
[49:38.44]Yes.
[49:38.90]Right.
[49:39.42]Nothing.
[49:40.58]Press that one.
[49:43.03]Final word is you're, like as in you're coming to dinner tonight.
[49:50.11]You're coming.
[49:51.04]You are.
[49:51.48]Apostrophe.
[49:52.02]Yes, you're.
[49:53.70]Middle right.
[49:54.18]Middle right.
[49:54.82]Nothing.
[49:58.00]Uh, with three H's.
[50:00.06]Right.
[50:00.94]Okay.
[50:01.96]Middle.
[50:02.84]Yes.
[50:03.74]Okay, A-Y?
[50:06.50]Okay, A-Y?
[50:06.84]Yes, four letters.
[50:07.72]Done.
[50:07.96]Four letters.
[50:09.44]I'm spirit, too.
[50:14.73]So can I still go over to dinner with you?
[50:17.97]Yeah, we're having pizza.
[50:19.31]Ham.
[50:19.47]Man, there'll be no pineapple, man.
[50:23.95]There's ham there.
[50:26.41]You ever just like eat... You ever bought ham from the store in a package and you just don't even make a sandwich, you just like eat it out of the... Do I eat ham?
[50:35.53]Is it cooked?
[50:37.99]Yeah, it's, you know, like, you know, it's not raw.
[50:40.03]I mean, it's like, you know, cheese slice, shit like that.
[50:41.87]Do you eat raw ham in a bag?
[50:44.42]Yeah.
[50:47.82]You don't do this?
[50:49.86]Um, I used to eat bagged chicken.
[50:51.57]I used to eat chicken out of a bag.
[50:54.97]That's fucking weird.
[50:56.19]What do you mean, like deli ham?
[50:57.25]Like sliced deli ham?
[50:59.21]Yes, like bologna.
[51:02.15]I thought you meant like you went to the store and you bought like a full ham in a bag and it was, I don't know.
[51:06.00]So you're saying like, I'm not saying, Jerma, do you eat raw pig?
[51:09.92]Like, no.
[51:13.16]I don't know.
[51:13.60]Let's just keep going.
[51:14.46]Alright, so let's go something's different.
[51:18.90]Okay, um, what's it say?
[51:20.44]Five minutes.
[51:22.64]Okay.
[51:23.39]Three modules.
[51:25.07]And it says, do these wires look different to you?
[51:27.33]Does this bomb look exploded to you?
[51:31.35]Great.
[51:31.75]Alright, well, let's, uh... Well, Seymour, you've got a good ham here.
[51:36.01]Thank you.
[51:38.86]I appreciate that.
[51:40.30]I didn't just speak up.
[51:41.16]Okay, let's go.
[51:48.84]I'm fucking nervous.
[51:49.58]We're going to die, Jerma.
[51:57.45]Hold on a second.
[51:58.21]I just like farmed a bad joke for fun.
[52:00.97]Alright.
[52:01.29]We got a Simon Says.
[52:04.13]Okay.
[52:04.73]First of all, do we have a vowel or do we not have a vowel?
[52:08.81]There is no vowel on this unit.
[52:13.60]There's no vowel.
[52:14.58]Okay.
[52:15.92]So what is the color?
[52:17.86]Blue.
[52:20.10]Yellow.
[52:20.48]Okay.
[52:23.60]Blue, green.
[52:26.98]Yellow, green.
[52:27.54]Okay.
[52:32.11]Blue, green, blue.
[52:35.59]Yellow, green, yellow.
[52:41.03]Blue, green, blue, red.
[52:45.02]Yellow, green, yellow, blue.
[52:46.36]Final one.
[52:51.66]Blue, green, blue, red, red.
[52:54.93]You're going to make fun of this, but... What?
[53:00.83]What?
[53:01.29]What happened?
[53:01.67]Hold on.
[53:02.45]You have a vowel?
[53:04.41]Did we have a vowel?
[53:05.97]Yes or no?
[53:06.56]Sorry.
[53:07.16]No.
[53:07.48]No?
[53:08.30]Hold on.
[53:09.08]Okay.
[53:09.46]Okay.
[53:09.86]Just making sure.
[53:10.56]Okay.
[53:11.04]So, read me them again.
[53:11.96]Sorry.
[53:12.20]Blue is quick.
[53:14.14]It was blue, green, blue, red, red.
[53:19.77]yellow green yellow blue and the last one was red yes yeah let's just refresh okay yes blue green blue red red yellow green yellow blue no no no sorry my bad no no that's yellow that's green that's yellow did we do it what it was red red what
[53:48.41]Jerma I have a suggestion right we clock out of this one now and repeat it immediately there's no need for this time waste let's just let's just redo this one let's leave the room back out of the situation and redo this mission alright because I lost my tr just walk away walk away walk away from this one
[54:12.98]You didn't have to kill us.
[54:14.65]I was like, go out of the fucking room.
[54:16.99]You didn't have to blow me off.
[54:17.99]It was quicker to do it that way.
[54:24.08]Alright, let's... Sorry, that was totally on me.
[54:27.40]Do you see how easy it is to just throw... It's so easy to throw everything off because it was like, okay, blue, green, blue, blue.
[54:34.03]Do we have a serial number?
[54:34.89]Do we have a vowel?
[54:35.81]It's like... It's super embarrassing, but the problem with that is like, it's like riding a bike.
[54:41.83]Like, you know how to do it, but somebody just like throws a stick in the wheel and you're like, okay.
[54:46.71]Like, alright, let's just cut our shit.
[54:50.78]Was there?
[54:51.14]No, there was no vowel.
[54:51.84]I don't remember.
[54:54.67]okay okay don't worry about this we're gonna do this here we go alright I'm gonna talk very clearly and very slowly okay alright we're gonna do this wires here we have six wires and they're in this order four blue two red blue blue blue red red last digit of the serial number is odd is the last digit of the serial number odd it is even
[55:19.26]Okay.
[55:22.10]It's exactly one yellow wire.
[55:24.14]It's only blue and red, four blue, two red.
[55:29.64]If there are no red wires, cut the last wire, but you do have red wires, yeah?
[55:32.30]There are two red wires.
[55:33.62]The last wire is red.
[55:35.02]Two red wires.
[55:35.92]Cut the fourth wire.
[55:36.92]Cut the fourth wire.
[55:37.82]Cut the fourth wire.
[55:39.93]Done.
[55:40.15]Okay.
[55:40.33]Okay.
[55:40.93]We have, um, some different looking wires.
[55:43.69]These are strange looking wires.
[55:44.85]They go, they go, they're, they're, they're different.
[55:47.01]They're vertical, not horizontal.
[55:48.69]Are they, are they, uh, do they have a star and a light on them?
[55:54.11]Um, yes, they did.
[55:56.59]They did for a second, but we're going to go with Simon Says because the lights just turned off.
[56:00.55]Simon Says.
[56:01.25]Okay.
[56:02.13]Simon Says.
[56:02.61]Holy shit.
[56:02.95]Okay.
[56:03.27]Yeah, I know.
[56:04.11]Okay.
[56:05.93]Are you still on that page?
[56:10.59]So read me the serial.
[56:12.21]Serial number.
[56:13.17]Serial is a vowel.
[56:13.95]It doesn't have a vowel.
[56:14.57]There is a vowel.
[56:15.65]Okay.
[56:16.33]So here we go.
[56:17.81]Okay.
[56:18.15]Let's go.
[56:18.61]First flash.
[56:19.51]Blue.
[56:22.13]Red.
[56:26.09]Blue, yellow.
[56:28.95]Red, green.
[56:31.19]Good.
[56:33.71]Blue, yellow, blue.
[56:37.15]Red, green, red.
[56:37.97]Hold on.
[56:45.40]Shut up.
[56:46.16]Not you.
[56:46.92]Alright.
[56:47.26]Back to the wires.
[56:47.86]That was it.
[56:48.12]We're done?
[56:49.36]We have five wires.
[56:52.46]That's what someone says?
[56:53.32]We're done with it?
[56:54.02]Yeah, that's it.
[56:54.58]That's it.
[56:54.90]It's green light.
[56:56.44]Okay, okay.
[56:56.98]Okay, so relax.
[56:57.92]We have three full minutes to figure this out.
[57:00.06]So just relax.
[57:00.82]Okay, here we go.
[57:01.92]We're going to be looking at something called... It's saying the... These wires are not like the others.
[57:08.25]Some have stripes.
[57:09.21]This makes them completely different.
[57:10.49]The good news is that we found a concise set of instructions.
[57:13.67]So this is what is referred as a... VAM diagram?
[57:18.43]Okay, I just got to align this.
[57:19.71]Okay, so what is the first one?
[57:22.09]Okay, so from left to right, it is white?
[57:25.27]Yes.
[57:26.81]Okay.
[57:27.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[57:28.60]Okay, that doesn't matter.
[57:30.06]The instructions said that doesn't matter.
[57:31.16]Okay, so I gotta align these.
[57:32.08]So we have... Does it have a star?
[57:34.20]Yeah, okay, there are three stars on the bottom.
[57:37.46]Okay.
[57:37.92]The first, second, and third wire are on a star.
[57:42.57]Okay.
[57:43.97]Okay, that won't matter then.
[57:44.91]Okay, so... You would need to...
[57:50.30]Let me read you the wires.
[57:52.96]Cut the first wire.
[57:53.90]First, like, left.
[57:55.37]The leftmost wire.
[57:56.87]Yes.
[57:58.11]Okay.
[57:59.61]There's more to do.
[58:01.39]Yes.
[58:03.99]What's the second one?
[58:05.49]So these wires are red, and then blue and red striped.
[58:09.57]That's it.
[58:10.95]So there's two blue and red striped, and then there's two red.
[58:14.86]Does it have a light?
[58:16.36]The blue and red stripe has a light, and it's on a star.
[58:21.03]Okay, it has a star.
[58:22.91]Don't cut that one.
[58:24.03]Next one.
[58:24.73]The next one is a red wire on a star with no light.
[58:30.07]Red wire with a star, no light.
[58:40.39]Cut that one.
[58:40.87]Okay.
[58:43.39]There's more to do.
[58:45.48]Okay, yeah, keep going, keep going.
[58:46.80]The next wire is no star with a light, and it is a red and blue striped wire.
[58:52.64]So just a light on this, no star?
[58:55.38]Just a light, no star.
[58:57.86]Is the last serial number even?
[59:00.88]Is the serial number even?
[59:05.83]Yeah, the number is even.
[59:08.43]Cut it.
[59:09.23]Cut that wire.
[59:09.83]Done.
[59:10.65]Okay.
[59:11.13]There are two wires that remain.
[59:13.79]Okay.
[59:14.78]The last wire is even.
[59:15.68]Does it have a star?
[59:16.78]The last wire does not have a star.
[59:19.42]Okay.
[59:20.02]So it has nothing on it.
[59:21.78]Just red?
[59:22.32]Does it have a star?
[59:22.90]Nothing.
[59:23.40]Nothing.
[59:23.68]Just red.
[59:25.18]It's the last even.
[59:26.46]It was even, right?
[59:27.08]It was even.
[59:27.48]It was even.
[59:28.18]Last serial number.
[59:29.26]Cut it.
[59:31.28]We did it.
[59:34.60]Somebody said hello.
[59:36.02]Cut it.
[59:36.42]Hello.
[59:37.14]Just cut it.
[59:37.74]Hello.
[59:38.26]What do you mean?
[59:38.86]I don't want to fuck it up.
[59:41.58]Okay.
[59:42.70]So, do you know what a Venn Diagram is?
[59:45.74]I'm gonna pretend to.
[59:47.24]Yes.
[59:47.96]Okay, so it's like a giant... It's like a bunch of circles with different colors, essentially.
[59:55.07]And inside of each circle, there's like... Yes, I know.
[59:57.31]That spells the solution, yes.
[59:59.63]Except these are colorless in the manual, so you're gonna have to really squint your fucking eyes.
[60:03.62]The only way of reading this is if the colors spell out...
[60:08.79]if they're striped or dotted.
[60:10.35]It's bullshit, but don't worry about it.
[60:12.83]I feel like you're doing a lot of good work here.
[60:16.66]NA education.
[60:17.52]Here's the thing about my NA education.
[60:20.12]Joel, I gotta ask you this.
[60:22.74]People are like, oh, I can't believe you didn't know what that symbol was.
[60:26.16]You didn't know what that math problem was.
[60:28.24]When was the last time you sat in a math class?
[60:33.05]When was the last time you were sitting in a chair in a math class?
[60:37.12]I feel like I'm in a math class every fucking stream with these people.
[60:44.44]A hundred years, I don't know.
[60:45.74]It's been a while, so... It's been 20 years since I've been in a math class.
[60:50.96]So yeah, I don't know what the Omega symbol is.
[60:52.79]You're 60?
[60:57.31]No, I'm... I turn 25 next week.
[61:06.05]This one's going to be hard.
[61:07.85]Okay.
[61:08.57]This one is four modules.
[61:10.89]And it says 60% of the time this bomb explodes every time.
[61:14.22]Okay.
[61:15.36]I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[61:16.44]Does this mean that we have a 60% chance to lose?
[61:19.04]It means nothing good.
[61:20.20]It means nothing good.
[61:21.02]Alright.
[61:24.00]Let's just... I'm ready to rock and roll, man.
[61:27.44]I'm ready.
[61:27.82]I'm feeling 100% about this.
[61:30.58]Did you take a multivitamin today?
[61:32.44]I took a multivitamin last time.
[61:34.12]It helped.
[61:35.65]It helped?
[61:36.69]Yeah.
[61:37.23]Yeah, but I don't need performance-enhancing drugs to do this.
[61:39.37]All I need is the skill of a gamer, alright?
[61:43.62]All those guys that got in trouble when they took vitamin B12.
[61:48.76]All those athletes.
[61:50.72]Yeah?
[61:53.08]It's about honor.
[61:54.34]It's about honor.
[61:55.52]Yeah, I'm low on vitamin D. I'm not going to drink any milk.
[61:59.17]Alright, you good?
[62:02.03]I'm good.
[62:03.37]Here we go.
[62:05.81]We have a different module.
[62:07.02]This module has megahertz on it, and it's a blinking light with almost like a radio dial.
[62:13.44]I can change the amount of megahertz, and there's a button that says TX.
[62:18.34]We have a blinking light up top, and then we have something with megahertz.
[62:21.37]It starts at 3.5.
[62:24.03]What do you mean Morse code?
[62:26.75]I don't hear anything.
[62:29.29]Is there a light going... If it was Morse code, wouldn't I be able to hear it?
[62:37.54]No, it's a visual, because that's how people communicate with flashlights in, like, World Wars.
[62:42.02]Okay, alright.
[62:42.62]Yes, there is a light up here.
[62:44.64]Okay.
[62:46.04]Do you know how to read Morse code, Jerma?
[62:48.02]No, absolutely not.
[62:49.06]Zero knowledge.
[62:49.76]I know that, like, I know...
[62:58.80]What's that?
[62:59.14]That's SOS, right?
[63:03.45]That's SOS.
[63:03.91]Why the fuck do I know?
[63:07.29]Why would I know Morse code?
[63:08.55]No, it's not.
[63:12.35]Is this 1910?
[63:12.73]What do you mean basic school knowledge?
[63:18.60]This is like 1840.
[63:19.32]Alright, ready?
[63:26.36]Jerma, I can't read Morse code either.
[63:27.58]I'm fucked too.
[63:28.66]Okay, so here we go.
[63:30.32]This... Alright, listen.
[63:34.25]We wasted a lot of time on this.
[63:35.53]Can you hear my stream?
[63:36.67]I can.
[63:37.01]Okay, you ready?
[63:40.87]Listen to my stream.
[63:41.51]I'm going to be quiet.
[63:43.53]No, hold on.
[63:50.46]What do you mean, hold on?
[64:11.60]Okay, Jeremiah, I have a better solution to this.
[64:14.62]Is that helping?
[64:14.96]I have a better solution to this.
[64:16.34]No, absolutely not.
[64:18.20]This is going to be a practice round.
[64:19.04]It doesn't matter if this explodes or not.
[64:20.82]We have to hammer this in.
[64:22.90]I have to teach you Morse code.
[64:24.98]Or rather... I got to complain about something.
[64:27.88]It's dots and dashes.
[64:28.64]I know the basics.
[64:29.66]It's dots and dashes.
[64:31.94]I just got to complain about something, chat.
[64:34.26]Yeah, yeah.
[64:35.32]Let me just explain something to both chats here.
[64:38.12]So, two weeks ago, I read the manual and it said...
[64:43.79]morse code and I've been telling chat for two weeks that chat I'm gonna learn morse code off stream so they can snitch on me and tell Jerma beforehand Joel has been practicing off stream in reality I did not practice at all because I wanted you guys to just see how much of a snitch you guys were to Jerma
[65:03.37]So I didn't practice at all.
[65:04.93]So you guys that have been going around talking to Jerma saying, hey, by the way, Joel's been cheating.
[65:10.42]You guys fucked up.
[65:11.60]I know who you guys are.
[65:13.08]I'm going to tell you on SOS and fucking Morse code because I'm coming over there and I'm going to tell you something.
[65:17.98]Snitches get stitches.
[65:19.70]Alright.
[65:20.30]So fuck you.
[65:21.28]Alright.
[65:21.64]Anyway, but that doesn't deduct from the problem here.
[65:24.50]We have to learn this.
[65:25.74]So I propose this Morse code is relatively simple.
[65:29.62]It's a matter of taking it slow and easy.
[65:32.03]So what I propose here, you're going to be reading me again.
[65:34.45]I know that there's a clock here, but don't worry about it exploding.
[65:37.25]We have to learn this.
[65:38.33]So again, I have a diagram.
[65:41.62]Okay.
[65:41.92]So here's what I'm going to say.
[65:44.34]This is going to be a repeating pattern essentially, right?
[65:46.64]Yes.
[65:48.20]And we don't need to read the full letter.
[65:50.89]So, for example, if the word will be shell, there will be a frequency at 3505.
[65:57.73]Do that as a test.
[65:58.70]Just ask anyway.
[66:01.76]Press TX.
[66:03.99]Okay, I just want to see if it worked anyway, but that doesn't matter.
[66:08.41]So here's what we're going to do.
[66:09.48]Again, I know that the clock is ticking, but this is just a practice round.
[66:13.02]So let me read this.
[66:16.96]Here we go.
[66:17.62]Okay.
[66:18.56]Interpret the signal from the flashing light using the Morse code chart to spell one of the words in the table.
[66:24.00]The signal will loop with a long gap between repetitions.
[66:27.38]Once the word is identified, set the corresponding frequency and press the transmit TX button.
[66:32.85]So essentially what we're going to be looking at here.
[66:36.93]is it's going to be actually quite simple.
[66:40.81]It's a series of letters.
[66:42.01]You are going to be reading me.
[66:43.35]Yeah.
[66:43.77]Yeah, you're going to be reading, you're going to say dot dash.
[66:47.88]Right, yeah.
[66:48.78]To spell out something, yes.
[66:50.30]And there's going to be a space in between these.
[66:51.92]When the spaces happen, I propose that you say dot dash comma, dot dot dash comma.
[66:57.94]Yes.
[66:58.34]And that's going to spell out a word for me to like deduct.
[67:01.02]And then we take that word and then we transpose that into a frequency.
[67:04.64]Into an actual word.
[67:05.34]So...
[67:08.17]Jerma, did any of that register?
[67:10.11]I was repeating the last three words you were saying and nodding my head.
[67:12.89]No, no, I get it, I get it.
[67:15.95]Yeah, it's dot, dot, dash.
[67:19.63]Dots and dashes, and then in between, like, for instance, like, dot, dot, dash.
[67:25.42]If it was dot, dot, dash, that's a letter.
[67:28.00]So, dot, dot, dash, that will actually, let me see if that actually means something.
[67:32.40]Dot, dot, dash would be U, as in the letter U. Yes.
[67:36.28]And after you say that, make sure you say comma, so you don't say dot, dot, dash, dash, dot, dot.
[67:41.42]Like, that would fuck me up.
[67:42.62]Yeah.
[67:42.97]Add a little comma between this so I know where to separate the letters.
[67:47.39]I think we're good to go.
[67:48.29]I think I get it.
[67:49.09]Okay, but keep in mind, if there's misspellings here, we're going to have to do this all over again.
[67:53.27]And this could lead to a lot of fucking problems.
[67:55.03]I'm going to be very... I'm known for my noises, right?
[67:58.94]Like, I mean, that's... Okay, good.
[68:01.14]I'm known to be able to get correct noises.
[68:03.20]If there's one thing I'm confident in, it's making noise.
[68:06.13]Okay.
[68:07.01]I'm ready.
[68:09.52]I'm known for, like, literally, if you type in Jerma985 into Google, the first thing that pops up is probably, like, the mini-sensory noise.
[68:15.95]So, like, I'm good.
[68:20.58]We don't have to do that, this one.
[68:21.67]Alright, we got the... We got the... We have a new module.
[68:25.37]It is three wires.
[68:28.43]Horizontal.
[68:29.23]And there's 1, 2, 3, A, B, C. It's a new module.
[68:32.31]Oh, we're looking at a wire sequence here.
[68:34.19]We're looking at a wire sequence.
[68:35.17]Yeah, it's a wire sequence.
[68:36.11]The wires are horizontal.
[68:37.47]And there's 1, 2, 3, A, B, C on the left and right.
[68:41.52]Let me read this and see what the fuck this is.
[68:43.76]Within this module, there are several panels.
[68:45.88]Okay, so basically...
[68:48.37]This is also going to be a practice round, because this is also going to be something completely fucking... Within this module, there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time.
[68:58.46]Switch to the next panel by using the down button, and the previous panel by using the up button.
[69:02.04]Okay.
[69:03.74]Okay, I pressed the down button to go to a new panel, and it said...
[69:08.72]don't don't don't touch no touch oh do not switch to the next panel until you're sure that you have cut all the necessary wires on the current panel Jerma anyway cut the wires as directed by the following table wire occurrences are cumulative all over the panels within the module and okay so the first one here you have to tell me uh one goes to what and what color okay so one for instance one is black and it goes one to a
[69:40.32]One to A. Okay.
[69:43.40]Cut it.
[69:43.76]Okay.
[69:46.10]The next wire is blue and it goes two to B. Do not cut that one.
[69:56.16]Actually, does it go to B?
[69:57.76]Yes.
[69:59.56]Sorry.
[70:00.12]Cut that one.
[70:01.41]That was my mistake.
[70:02.39]I'm so sorry.
[70:03.07]I'm so glad that there's like a lot of audio in the background because that was like a bullfrog noise that I made.
[70:09.39]Alright.
[70:09.67]So then three goes to C and that's the last one to cut anyways.
[70:12.05]So I cut it.
[70:13.07]Yes.
[70:13.65]Yes.
[70:13.83]And then go down.
[70:14.37]Okay.
[70:15.77]I see.
[70:16.09]Alright.
[70:16.85]I get you.
[70:18.05]Alright.
[70:18.29]So we got four, five, six.
[70:19.75]There is no wire on four.
[70:22.19]We have black wire, five B. Skip to the next one.
[70:29.09]Black wire, six C. Yeah.
[70:31.87]Yeah.
[70:32.07]Just skip the next one.
[70:33.08]I think this will work.
[70:33.92]Okay.
[70:35.76]It's seven, eight, nine.
[70:37.14]And then A, B, C.
[70:40.02]Eight goes to C, blue wire.
[70:44.88]Cut the blue one.
[70:48.24]Nine now goes to C, black wire.
[70:51.73]And then we'll take... In terms of occurrences, how many blacks... This will be... So this will be the second, right?
[71:01.89]We have to keep track of how many wires there were.
[71:05.53]Okay, and then we'll be... So this will be the second one.
[71:09.35]Go up, go up, go up.
[71:10.79]Oh, you can go up.
[71:11.37]Okay, so wait.
[71:13.10]Okay, so there are two black wires here on this one.
[71:18.22]And then on the one before that, there's one black wire on the one before that.
[71:22.16]So we're looking at four in total now.
[71:25.00]So this is the fourth black wire.
[71:28.01]Okay, does it go to C?
[71:29.81]Yes.
[71:31.11]Cut it.
[71:31.41]Okay, that's it.
[71:34.69]Next one is 10, 11, 12, A, B, C.
[71:39.83]10 is a blue wire, 10, B. So the blue one will be, in terms of occurrence, we'll be looking at the... This would be one... This would be the third blue wire.
[71:53.48]Does it go to A?
[71:55.44]It does not.
[71:56.32]It goes to B. Okay, so second one, second one.
[72:02.37]It's a red wire, 11, C.
[72:06.44]Okay, and that will be, I think, the second one?
[72:08.30]Yeah.
[72:09.13]I don't know.
[72:12.85]Yeah, probably.
[72:14.81]Just go next.
[72:15.25]Just go next.
[72:16.01]You can't say probably.
[72:18.11]Yeah, probably.
[72:19.15]I don't know.
[72:22.01]Listen, it's a completely new fucking mod to me and I don't... It's hard to like decipher what the fuck these mean, but whatever, whatever.
[72:30.00]Listen, if we refresh now and we get a Morse code one, I think we're good.
[72:35.68]Alright, we've learned these two.
[72:37.74]We've learned these two now.
[72:40.02]Maybe.
[72:41.85]Okay, let's just kick some ass.
[72:43.17]You have to go in absolutes if you're a bomb defuser.
[72:46.27]No, you got it.
[72:46.79]You got it.
[72:47.19]You got it, man.
[72:47.71]You got it.
[72:48.09]Here we go.
[72:48.79]Ready?
[72:49.51]Yes.
[72:50.05]Yes.
[72:50.65]Restart in go.
[72:53.72]Simon says.
[72:55.46]Okay, but are you sure it's just Simon says though?
[72:59.13]I mean, Simon says that we have Morse code on this one and one of the new wire ones.
[73:04.37]Simon says it's right here.
[73:06.69]How about this?
[73:07.50]Another practice round here because here's what I want to do.
[73:10.16]I want to get this Morse code shit down here so we can do this in the future, right?
[73:13.00]You got it.
[73:13.32]Here comes Morse code.
[73:13.98]So, you remember what I said about saying, like, commas and all that shit?
[73:17.64]Yep.
[73:18.42]I got you.
[73:18.78]I got you.
[73:19.40]Alright.
[73:19.63]So, let me wait until we get a big break here.
[73:23.11]Okay.
[73:23.33]Hold on.
[73:24.81]Mm-hmm.
[73:27.77]dot dot dot dot that's h okay
[73:42.91]Okay, so we have dot, dot, dot.
[73:45.07]Jeremiah, I already know the answer.
[73:46.11]It's 3505.
[73:46.25]3505.
[73:46.27]3505 is the solution.
[73:46.79]No, it's not.
[73:48.14]3505.
[73:48.18]Did you put 3.505?
[73:48.78]3.505. 3505.
[73:57.93]3-5-1-5.
[73:58.29]3-5-1-5.
[73:59.17]That's correct.
[74:01.29]Sorry, my bad.
[74:01.93]How did you do that?
[74:02.75]Okay.
[74:02.85]Alright.
[74:03.65]Now we've got the wires.
[74:04.45]I'll tell you.
[74:05.21]I'll tell you the solution for this.
[74:06.65]And this is going to be a strategy for us.
[74:07.89]Alright.
[74:08.15]I know we probably can't do this.
[74:09.11]This is another practice round here.
[74:10.68]Do this quick.
[74:11.10]Okay.
[74:11.30]So basically, I have all these words that correspond to the letter.
[74:14.44]And basically, if the letter or there's words.
[74:17.00]There's words.
[74:17.92]There's all of these words.
[74:19.72]But this one was unique because it was the only one that started with an H. That means I can deduct and immediately know the answer beforehand.
[74:25.87]So I can immediately spit out the code at you.
[74:29.17]That's fine.
[74:30.23]Alright.
[74:31.13]Alright.
[74:31.63]We got the wire when we practiced last time.
[74:33.73]Here it comes.
[74:34.77]Alright.
[74:34.99]We have two red wires.
[74:38.25]1, 2, 3, A, B, C.
[74:39.61]1, B. Red.
[74:41.81]Okay.
[74:44.07]You're gonna have to repeat that because I got lost in the manual here.
[74:46.27]I'm so sorry.
[74:47.59]We have this thing like that.
[74:51.19]Okay.
[74:51.41]So we have two red wires.
[74:52.71]That's correct.
[74:54.59]Okay.
[74:54.89]So the first one...
[74:57.70]Uh, does it go to C?
[75:00.15]No, you said A, right?
[75:01.41]One goes from one to B, red wire.
[75:04.17]Okay, do not cut that one.
[75:06.15]The second one goes to... To A. Two to A, red wire.
[75:10.50]Skip all of these.
[75:11.70]Let's go to the next one.
[75:13.17]The next one we have 4, 5, 6, A, B, C. The first wire is a black wire, 4 to B. Second wire is a blue wire.
[75:22.55]Cut the black wire.
[75:23.11]Cut the black wire.
[75:24.82]Okay.
[75:25.22]The next wire is a blue wire, 5 to C. Skip to the next.
[75:33.40]This next one is 7, 8, 9, A, B, C. The two wires that are present on this module are red and black.
[75:42.11]Do we have...
[75:43.55]Okay, if there's a red wire, cut it right now.
[75:46.71]Okay.
[75:47.79]The next one is a black wire, 9A.
[75:52.01]Okay, and this would be the third black wire, yeah?
[75:55.41]Okay, this would be the one.
[75:56.83]This would be the second black wire.
[76:00.25]Okay, and that goes to... A. A, you said.
[76:02.84]Cut it.
[76:05.51]Got it.
[76:06.39]Okay.
[76:06.81]Last one.
[76:07.77]We have three wires.
[76:08.79]It's 10, 11, 12, A, B, C. This is a black wire.
[76:12.29]It's the first one.
[76:12.99]It goes to B. Cut the black wire.
[76:17.03]Okay.
[76:17.63]Now we have two red wires.
[76:20.62]11B.
[76:22.60]Okay.
[76:22.90]And in terms of occurrences, this one will be the third or fourth one, yeah?
[76:28.82]This would be the 1, 2, 3...
[76:35.80]This would be the fourth red wire that has occurred.
[76:40.32]Does the fourth one here go to A?
[76:43.20]It goes to B. Okay, do not cut that one.
[76:46.84]And the last one was a red wire as well.
[76:48.82]And it's 12A.
[76:51.56]Skip to the next one.
[76:52.78]Done, okay.
[76:53.96]We have symbols, you ready?
[76:56.10]Yeah.
[76:57.10]AE, Trident, Stitches, H or N?
[77:01.90]Batman symbol, Batman symbol.
[77:04.66]What?
[77:09.22]I heard the fucking music.
[77:10.12]I know we would be fucked.
[77:11.44]There's no fucking way I could spit out that much shit.
[77:15.05]Maybe Aquaman.
[77:17.73]Alright, we're getting that done.
[77:19.31]So we gotta keep track of the amount.
[77:21.76]I got it.
[77:23.80]Alright, so Morse code is not a problem for us now.
[77:26.02]I think.
[77:26.55]I think we got that down.
[77:27.85]And the occurrence wires, I think we got too.
[77:30.11]The thing we got to be watching out for though is we got those complicated wires.
[77:34.83]But I think I got that down with the Venn diagram.
[77:36.43]So, alright.
[77:37.69]I think these new complicated wires that have been, you know, generated for it.
[77:43.36]I think we're good.
[77:43.88]So, next one.
[77:44.68]Here we go.
[77:44.98]I think we can do this.
[77:45.96]I think we're good.
[77:46.64]I think we got it this time.
[77:47.54]Yeah, I think so.
[77:48.22]Yeah, yeah.
[77:48.64]Absolutely.
[77:49.10]Alright.
[77:49.34]Are you guys ready?
[77:50.70]Are you ready?
[77:52.05]Are you ready?
[77:52.81]I'm ready, man.
[77:53.61]I'm ready, man.
[77:54.59]Alright.
[77:54.95]Game Boy with a word to spell.
[77:57.17]Okay.
[77:57.41]We're going to be spelling out a word here.
[77:58.59]So we're going to be looking at the... This is called a... This is called the subject password.
[78:04.33]So I'm going to be writing down all the first ones in the first column, right?
[78:07.19]So get ready.
[78:07.75]Okay.
[78:08.61]Here we go.
[78:09.11]Ready?
[78:09.73]First letter in the first column.
[78:11.53]B, J, C, T, E, D. So we're looking at B, J, Ted.
[78:23.21]Yes, yes.
[78:24.76]BJ Ted, correct.
[78:26.58]Okay, BJ Ted, second row.
[78:28.56]C-E-H-N-W-S.
[78:36.40]So, C-E-H-N-W-S.
[78:38.54]That's correct.
[78:41.19]Okay, so, and the third ones are... S-L-N-B-I-K.
[78:46.69]Okay.
[78:50.82]Okay.
[78:51.06]So the first one.
[78:51.56]Let's see here.
[78:52.64]CBT Ted.
[78:54.16]Hang on.
[78:58.44]T. Does anyone start with T?
[79:02.85]The word is think.
[79:04.75]Think?
[79:06.21]Mm-hmm.
[79:06.55]I think so.
[79:08.37]Would make sense, wouldn't it?
[79:09.97]No.
[79:10.77]Yes, it is.
[79:16.01]It could be thing.
[79:17.19]The word is thing.
[79:17.75]The word is thing.
[79:18.59]Alright.
[79:18.91]We got the worst code.
[79:20.98]Okay.
[79:21.10]We got Morse code.
[79:21.76]Alright.
[79:22.02]You ready now?
[79:22.76]Now, keep in mind.
[79:23.75]I want you to like remember these.
[79:25.33]So, like say comma in between.
[79:27.91]So, here we go.
[79:33.97]Dot, dot, dot, dash.
[79:37.49]Dot, dot, dot, dash.
[79:38.41]So, we got a V. Did that help you?
[79:43.27]Yeah, yeah.
[79:43.57]Okay.
[79:45.49]Jerma, try putting in 3595 as a solution.
[79:50.14]3595.
[79:50.16]Got it.
[79:50.96]Okay.
[79:56.08]Okay.
[79:57.02]Uh, now we have the word game, where like, there, you, uh, what, huh?
[80:01.47]Okay, I got that.
[80:02.53]So, what's the first thing?
[80:03.37]Are you prepared, huh?
[80:04.51]Okay, the first word is there.
[80:05.73]I am.
[80:06.55]It is there.
[80:08.21]Like, as in, like, yours.
[80:09.13]Not like a place.
[80:10.81]Their.
[80:12.02]Their pizza.
[80:12.58]Like, their pizza.
[80:14.32]Okay, so middle right.
[80:15.40]Middle right.
[80:16.46]What?
[80:17.30]What with a question mark.
[80:18.30]What?
[80:19.88]What with a question mark.
[80:21.44]So, we got... With three H's.
[80:23.90]We got... What?
[80:24.92]Four letters.
[80:25.98]Left.
[80:26.99]Nothing.
[80:27.97]Ready.
[80:28.31]Ready.
[80:30.16]what is on here but it's what I just asked what I just said to you though what with a question mark oh yeah no no no what what is the word here okay oh no no no no no okay I got okay uh wait okay the word is there their pizza in the middle right sex spot is what you hold your with an apostrophe single you or you you like you a person uh u s in like three letters yes okay it's there okay next next word
[81:00.99]Okay.
[81:01.43]We have you.
[81:02.67]It is Y-O-U.
[81:03.69]You as a person.
[81:04.27]You.
[81:04.53]Okay.
[81:07.61]Let's see here.
[81:08.15]You.
[81:08.73]We're looking at you.
[81:11.05]Middle right.
[81:11.47]Middle right.
[81:12.37]No.
[81:14.43]Blank.
[81:15.93]Three H's.
[81:17.02]Wait.
[81:17.98]First.
[81:19.18]Got it.
[81:20.80]Final word is you again.
[81:22.72]Y-O-U.
[81:23.38]You.
[81:23.64]So we're looking at middle right again.
[81:27.08]You.
[81:27.70]Y-O-U.
[81:28.30]The person.
[81:28.70]You.
[81:30.51]Sure, you are with a space in between.
[81:33.34]You're possessive.
[81:34.80]You're with an apostrophe.
[81:36.32]Next.
[81:37.00]Uh-huh.
[81:39.88]We got one more, and it's just, it's the symbols, like the Half-Life symbol thing, right?
[81:43.88]Half-Life symbol.
[81:45.10]Alright, we have Half-Life symbol, mirrored K, sleepy 3, and a not-filled-in star.
[81:52.61]Okay, uh... The X looking weird thing?
[81:58.38]Uh, we're looking at the, uh, the three.
[82:00.76]Yep.
[82:02.48]Half-Life and the Weird Star.
[82:07.42]Sleepy three.
[82:11.24]Sleepy three?
[82:15.18]Yeah, it's like somebody just, like, was doing three and then they just fell asleep when they got to the end.
[82:21.78]We had a minute left to go.
[82:22.85]That's our best time, by the way.
[82:24.87]That's good.
[82:25.73]You know what, though?
[82:26.49]I think the Morse code is really easy.
[82:27.95]The problem with the Morse code, though, is sometimes I can't do that logical... What is it called?
[82:33.22]Elimination, where you're like, you know...
[82:37.14]basically the word was vector right there's only one word like that there's one V in it so what I chose to do was just go V and then it's got to be vector so I correspond with the frequency on it but there might be several ones that start with t for example that means I have to also get the second letter so I can't do up I think it's process of elimination I think it's called so uh it's it's gonna the challenge will ramp up but don't worry I think we got this
[83:02.38]This next one is called Fair Game.
[83:04.10]It's called No More Handholding.
[83:05.42]Remember everything you've learned because anything can appear on the bump.
[83:09.31]This is a big one.
[83:10.47]This is the gear check.
[83:14.69]This is five modules.
[83:16.37]It's five minutes.
[83:17.15]This is the DPS check.
[83:20.03]Dude, let me tell you something.
[83:20.77]I've been so nervous.
[83:21.49]I've been holding in this P. Now that I can relax, the PP instincts are kicking in.
[83:27.48]I got to go.
[83:28.08]I'm sorry.
[83:28.42]You want to go P?
[83:30.57]You want to take a pee?
[83:32.23]Alright.
[83:32.51]Alright.
[83:32.77]We'll take it.
[83:33.85]Wait, are you like sprinting to go pee or is this like, let's take a break for two minutes?
[83:37.82]Yes.
[83:38.88]Which one?
[83:39.68]Yeah.
[83:40.58]You or you, you're or you're.

[83:53.29]Go pee with him now.
[83:54.15]No, I'm going to take a long, it's going to take a lot longer for me.
[83:59.42]Guys, I take my time when I pee.
[84:01.82]I, like, arch my back.
[84:02.95]I, like, crack the neck.
[84:05.69]I, like, roll my shoulders a little bit.
[84:08.59]I look directly into the bowl for a full ten seconds and I go, alright.
[84:14.85]That's, that's where it's going.
[84:17.03]Right there.
[84:20.00]And then they're okay.
[84:23.10]I take my time.
[84:23.90]I don't, I don't rush pee.
[84:32.27]Where else is it going?
[84:34.51]Where else is it gonna go?
[84:36.13]You know what?
[84:36.65]Today... Today I think I'm going right at the back wall.
[84:39.69]I think that's where I'm going today.
[84:48.69]No one wanted to know that.
[84:56.68]This is how Jerma paints his house.
[85:00.00]Do the sentry noise.
[85:05.22]I don't need to do the sentry noise right now.
[85:06.64]It's not necessary.
[85:23.67]This is what it's like when you go somewhere with somebody, and you don't have to pee, but they do.
[85:28.95]And you just want to get to where you're going.
[85:31.67]And it's like, hey man, I'm just going to go pee.

[88:11.03]Does anyone want to start with W?
[88:13.23]Yes, it's true.
[88:14.55]It could be that.
[88:15.99]I got it.
[88:16.99]The word was world.

[88:23.30]Simon Says?
[88:23.66]Okay.
[88:24.28]Whatever.
[88:24.66]I have to deduct that later on.
[88:25.68]Whatever.
[88:25.96]So, serial.
[88:27.04]Serial.
[88:27.52]Serial number is... Serial number is... What are you looking for?
[88:32.30]Vowel?
[88:33.85]Yes.
[88:34.05]No vowels.
[88:34.31]No vowels.
[88:36.05]No vowel.

[88:41.21]Green.
[88:43.87]Green.
[88:47.90]Green.
[88:51.42]That's the solution, sorry.
[88:52.90]What?
[88:53.10]Oh, okay.
[88:54.22]That is the solution.

[89:04.65]Green, green, green.
[89:06.71]Green, green, green.
[89:09.14]What the fuck's going on?
[89:10.20]Okay, done.
[89:11.55]Now we got the wire scenario.
[89:14.67]No, no, no.
[89:14.95]We got the box with the number in it with the sequence.
[89:17.77]You gotta remember the sequences.
[89:18.89]That shit's easy because you're like an elephant.
[89:21.64]You remember everything.
[89:22.22]Anyway.
[89:23.64]Sorry, I don't want to say that.
[89:24.40]But whatever.
[89:25.42]Let's just do occurrences or whatever it's called, right?
[89:26.86]The complicated wires.
[89:28.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[89:29.88]No, no, no.
[89:30.60]We're doing the number with the sequence.
[89:34.18]The number in the box.
[89:36.02]You want to do the complicated wires?
[89:37.94]Yes, because that's a hard one.
[89:41.86]Okay.
[89:43.16]Tell me.
[89:43.78]Which ones do we have?
[89:45.45]We have... It's 1, 2, 3, A, B, C. Okay.
[89:50.49]Black, red.
[89:52.39]Cut it.
[89:53.43]What?
[89:54.25]Cut it.
[89:55.73]Cut the black wire.
[89:56.39]Okay.
[89:57.29]What else?
[89:58.81]Red, 2C.
[89:59.35]What else do we have?
[90:00.43]Red, 2C.
[90:03.05]Cut that one too.
[90:05.24]Next, we have one black wire, four to B, four, five, six, A, B, C, four to B, black wire.
[90:10.72]Skip, skip, skip.
[90:12.34]Next, we have seven, eight, nine, A, B, C, blue, red, black, blue, seven goes to A. This is the first blue one?
[90:18.77]That is the first blue wire of the game.
[90:21.63]Okay, skip that one.
[90:22.85]Don't skip the thing.
[90:23.73]Don't skip that one.
[90:25.07]Did you skip the thing?
[90:26.59]I did not skip it.
[90:27.59]I clicked it and it was a strike.
[90:30.34]okay shit now okay okay so when I say skip it I didn't mean like whatever so that was the blue one right okay so that this is the second red one second red one right nope yep second red wire second red wire and it's from a to eight to a okay don't cut that one send and then it will be the
[90:52.90]The third black wire.
[90:56.34]The last wire is a black wire, and it is the third black wire of the video game.
[91:02.57]Okay, what does that go to?
[91:04.05]B. Cut.
[91:05.85]Is that it?
[91:07.51]Mm-hmm.
[91:09.98]Final one is 10, 11, 12, A, B, C. Two blue wires, one red.
[91:14.62]Blue, blue, red.
[91:16.04]10, A, 11, B, 12, B. Gotcha, but in terms of occurrences, the blue one, this will be the third one?
[91:21.83]No, this will be the... Yes.
[91:24.41]This will be one, two, three... No!
[91:28.35]This will be the third... Two and three of blue wires, yes.
[91:32.17]Okay, so third one.
[91:33.53]Does it go to B?
[91:36.00]It goes to A. Okay, don't cut that one.
[91:42.29]We had three seconds ahead of me.
[91:45.40]We had three seconds.
[91:46.04]I was just trying to guess.
[91:51.14]No guessing.
[91:53.78]How the fuck did you deduct that... What do you call it?
[91:57.72]I just saw W. I just saw W and just went with it.
[92:02.94]There was like four fucking different ones.
[92:06.04]You had a 25% chance of winning and you won?
[92:08.73]I think it was just on O. I saw like the OR and then I saw there was a W. So I was like, it's World.
[92:13.73]I guess.
[92:14.09]Okay, I'm just telling you.
[92:16.69]Don't do a cowboy move like that again.
[92:18.70]We don't know what's going to happen.
[92:21.58]Alright, I won't do it again.
[92:23.33]I promise.
[92:24.81]Okay.
[92:25.69]So this one, we're starting with... We've got a new module, but it's... Pick it up!
[92:31.20]It's the Pac-Man module.
[92:32.52]The thing with the red triangle and the lights...
[92:35.87]Okay.
[92:36.37]I remember when we did this last time.
[92:37.43]Okay.
[92:37.63]So we're going to be referring to this as A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Right?
[92:41.49]Do you understand what I mean there?
[92:42.65]So when I'm saying numbers here, I'm saying like the vertical one.
[92:48.31]So I'm saying like alpha 1, you'll be in the first position.
[92:51.27]If I'm saying B2, that would be like... Yeah.
[92:56.52]Like one over and down.
[92:58.22]Like one over and down.
[92:59.50]Yeah.
[92:59.94]One over and down.
[93:01.04]Okay.
[93:01.24]So where did you spawn here?
[93:02.98]I spawned in alpha 2.
[93:07.94]Alpha 2.
[93:08.84]Okay.
[93:11.45]Okay.
[93:11.99]And then we have two dots here.
[93:14.25]We have two dots here.
[93:15.47]Yes.
[93:16.19]Where are they located?
[93:17.43]The two circles are located in Beta 1 and Beta 6.
[93:25.21]Okay.
[93:25.47]Beta 1 and Beta 6.
[93:26.97]And you spawn in A2?
[93:28.99]A2.
[93:31.29]Okay.
[93:32.51]And the light is in... A, B, C... Is in...
[93:37.41]dare what is it delta delta six okay then go down one uh did it work what's going on tell me why am I not moving did I go I had it down twice what's going on why is it not moving drama did you do this correctly you didn't you didn't confuse the red and white did you I did
[94:04.75]Oh, so we're... Gemma.
[94:07.29]Let's restart.
[94:07.91]I didn't know.
[94:08.99]I thought that was us.
[94:11.03]Because every video game that's ever existed, you are the fucking triangle pointing.
[94:15.51]In every single game.
[94:16.85]You're the triangle that's pointing.
[94:17.86]You're the triangle on the minimap.
[94:19.00]Every time.
[94:20.10]Alright, just scratch it.
[94:21.14]Just go.
[94:22.52]Scratch it.
[94:24.28]You ready?
[94:24.80]Scratch it.
[94:25.34]New device.
[94:26.78]Let's kick ass.
[94:27.54]Let's kick its ass.
[94:29.36]We have a blue button.
[94:30.82]That button says detonate on it.
[94:34.28]It says detonate.
[94:35.25]Alright, so let's see here.
[94:39.01]How many batteries do we have on this one?
[94:40.39]The amount of batteries are... We have one battery.
[94:48.45]And it says detonate.
[94:49.59]Detonate blue.
[94:52.60]Okay, but the problem is there is not more than one.
[94:55.10]There's just one.
[94:55.84]Not more than one.
[94:56.50]There is only one button here.
[94:57.98]It's a blue button that says detonate.
[95:02.27]It's a lit indicator on this one.
[95:04.23]There is.
[95:04.69]It's on the right.
[95:07.11]Okay.
[95:07.41]Does it say F or K?
[95:10.32]No, it says T-R-N.
[95:13.10]Okay.
[95:14.46]Well, we're going to be holding down this button.
[95:16.80]Okay.
[95:17.58]Yellow flashing light.
[95:19.84]We're five in any position.
[95:21.30]Okay.
[95:21.80]Good.
[95:22.38]Very good.
[95:23.16]Five in any position.
[95:24.05]Let it go.
[95:25.13]Okay.
[95:25.87]Now we have Game Boy Find the Word.
[95:28.99]War Scrambler, alright, here we go.
[95:31.37]So I'm gonna be starting writing this down, so here we go.
[95:34.76]R, T, Z, V, S, I. Okay, next one.
[95:42.54]P, U, Y, T, M, I, P. Okay, before we do that one, let's see here.
[95:51.60]V, V, V, V, is there any V words?
[95:54.12]No, S, S, S, S. Bring me the third ones, bring me the third ones.
[96:01.55]The word is study.
[96:02.91]Done.
[96:03.65]Okay, we have, uh... We have symbols.
[96:06.25]The weird symbols with, like, the TB and the K and the... Okay, okay.
[96:09.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[96:10.29]I got it.
[96:10.57]I got it.
[96:10.89]I got it for you.
[96:13.24]Alright, so... Holy shit, you're really good at this.
[96:15.18]Okay, uh... So, uh... What are we looking at here?
[96:18.46]We're looking at, uh... The mirrored K. Uh... The backwards P. Um... It's dark.
[96:27.47]Mirrored K. Backwards P. What is dark?
[96:29.45]Uh...
[96:30.29]Uh, the lights turned off.
[96:31.15]Mirrored K, backwards B, TB, and then, um, an octopus holding a spear.
[96:37.78]Okay, I got, I got, I got you.
[96:39.50]What the fuck?
[96:41.00]Uh, do the backwards P. Yep.
[96:44.59]Do TB.
[96:45.03]Yep.
[96:46.59]Weird X.
[96:48.75]No?
[96:49.07]That's alright.
[96:49.63]Reverse.
[96:50.01]And then there will be a spider with spear and then... Sorry.
[96:52.41]Okay.
[96:53.45]Okay.
[96:53.85]We got plenty of time.
[96:56.03]It's the number with the thing in the middle.
[96:57.89]The big box with the number.
[96:59.23]Okay.
[96:59.57]Okay.
[97:00.63]No problem.
[97:00.97]No problem.
[97:01.65]The number is... Four.
[97:04.89]Fourth position.
[97:05.55]Okay.
[97:09.24]The number is two.
[97:12.82]Press the button in the same position as pressing stage one.
[97:14.70]Same position.
[97:15.34]Same position.
[97:17.40]Ugh, fuck.
[97:18.50]I think it was four.
[97:20.04]I think.
[97:20.74]Yep.
[97:20.94]Okay.
[97:21.10]Alright.
[97:22.34]Next number.
[97:22.68]You're making me nervous.
[97:23.86]Is one.
[97:28.22]Alright.
[97:29.31]Same label as the person in stage two.
[97:30.85]Same label as the person in stage two.
[97:32.59]Got it.
[97:33.01]Okay.
[97:34.11]The number is one.
[97:35.41]Again.
[97:37.17]Press the button in the same position as the person in stage one.
[97:40.11]Same position or the same label?
[97:41.67]Position.
[97:42.27]Position as stage one.
[97:43.23]Yes.
[97:43.99]Final number is one.
[97:46.96]Press the same button with the same label as you pressed on stage one.
[97:49.62]Same label.
[97:50.66]Okay, we got one more module.
[97:52.24]This is the complicated wire.
[97:53.58]It's going to go horizontal.
[97:54.51]One, two, three, A, B, C. Okay, okay.
[97:56.25]Let me clock into this one.
[97:58.25]Here we go.
[97:58.67]Here we go.
[97:58.99]Alright, so we got what?
[98:00.95]Black wire only from two to C. Cut.
[98:05.85]Okay, next.
[98:07.03]We've got, uh, this would be the second and third black wire, so we have two black wires, one red, four, five, six, A, B, C. Where's the second one go to?
[98:15.08]The second black wire is going to A. The second wire is going to B, and it's red.
[98:21.57]So the first, okay, so don't cut the first wire.
[98:24.23]Do not cut the first wire.
[98:26.48]Okay.
[98:27.42]The... Okay.
[98:28.16]So give me the... Give me the... There was another second black one, right?
[98:30.72]Okay.
[98:30.88]The second black wire is going to A. It's in the third... It's six to A. Skip that one.
[98:35.55]Skip this whole thing.
[98:36.47]And then we got what?
[98:37.65]Okay.
[98:37.89]Now we have one red wire, two blues.
[98:40.43]Red, blue, blue.
[98:42.43]And the current... This would be the second red wire?

[107:57.56]The third one.
[107:58.06]We were doing so good.
[108:04.62]Shit.
[108:05.37]I'm sorry.

[108:11.83]Whatever.
[108:13.23]Oh, fuck.
[108:13.65]I'm sorry.
[108:14.05]I should have asked if there's a light.
[108:15.81]I forgot about the light.
[108:16.69]It's my fault.
[108:17.27]I should have brought it up.
[108:17.92]I saw it but I didn't want to say it.
[108:19.52]I take responsibility.
[108:20.74]My bad.

[108:36.36]Is it my fault?
[108:38.50]No, stop attacking Jerma.
[108:41.84]I will be the Christ on the cross on this one.
[108:44.13]Attack my flesh, alright?
[108:46.85]I will take the explosion into my body, alright?
[108:49.41]That was me.
[108:51.22]Don't, don't, don't slug off a Jerma.
[108:54.24]Well, even if you stood in front of me, it would just liquidate the both of us.
[108:57.20]It's not like it's gonna stop anything.
[109:00.40]Do a new one.
[109:03.22]Okay.

[111:29.81]Okay.
[111:30.17]Blank.
[111:30.87]Blank.
[111:31.61]Blank.
[111:32.13]Here we go.
[111:35.15]Wait.
[111:36.10]Right.
[111:37.02]Okay.
[111:37.48]Four letters.
[111:38.20]Got it.
[111:38.44]Metal.
[111:39.54]Okay.
[111:39.78]Gotcha.
[111:40.04]Got it.
[111:40.42]Next, we have the sequence of the annoying wires.
[111:44.40]The horizontal ones.
[111:45.00]The ones that are like, oh, black.
[111:46.66]Oh, red.
[111:47.00]Okay.
[111:47.72]So, first one.
[111:48.58]First red one.
[111:49.12]First red one.
[111:49.62]So, red is going to C. Cut it.
[111:52.67]Okay.
[111:52.95]Second wire is red also going to B. Cut it.
[111:56.61]The last wire is a black wire going to C. Cut it.
[111:59.55]Okay.
[112:01.52]Next, we have a black wire going to A and a blue wire going to C. Four to A. Cut the black wire.
[112:07.39]Cut the black wire, okay?
[112:08.45]Blue wire is going to C6C.
[112:09.97]It's the third slot.
[112:12.35]And that is the first one we've seen.
[112:13.53]That is the first blue wire.
[112:15.89]And do not cut that one.
[112:17.55]Skip to the next round.
[112:18.41]Next round.
[112:19.29]We have two blue wires going from 7 to C and then 9 to A. Two blue... Cut the first... Cut the... Wait.
[112:27.47]This is the... This is the first blue wire.
[112:28.92]Yes.
[112:29.26]No.
[112:29.50]This would be the... These would be the second and third blue wires.
[112:32.02]Second.
[112:32.36]Second.
[112:33.28]This would be the second, right?
[112:34.90]This one here would be the second blue wire.
[112:37.28]Okay.
[112:37.58]Does that go to C?
[112:38.62]Yes.
[112:40.06]Cut that one.
[112:41.38]Next is the third blue wire and it's going to... It's going to A.
[112:45.24]Skip that one.
[112:46.48]Okay.
[112:47.06]Finally, we have a fourth blue wire going to B. And then we have... This is the fourth occurrence blue wire.
[112:53.28]Fourth occurrence blue wire.
[112:55.18]Does that go to B?
[112:56.00]Yes.
[112:57.34]Cut it.
[112:57.66]That is incorrect.
[112:59.52]It's okay.
[113:00.24]Whatever.
[113:01.36]So we have a black and red wire next.
[113:04.32]Both going to C. Black.
[113:06.15]C. So the black wire... Occurrence for black wire would be... That would be the... The third black wire.
[113:14.38]Does that go to B?
[113:15.02]Does that go to B?
[113:15.76]That third black wire goes to C. Skip that one.
[113:19.85]And the red one will be what occurrence?
[113:21.57]The red wire is also going to C, and it would be the third occurrence of red.
[113:28.54]Skip that one.
[113:29.16]Skip that one.
[113:29.70]Skip it all.
[113:30.24]Okay, that should be it.
[113:31.26]Yes.

[124:18.43]Hang on.
[124:18.81]I'm almost ready.
[124:19.31]I'm almost ready.
[124:19.77]Okay.
[124:20.41]So, what are we looking at?
[124:21.72]Red, blue, black.
[124:23.82]Red goes to C. Okay.
[124:25.98]Cut.
[124:26.48]Cut red.
[124:27.50]Blue goes to C. Skip that one.
[124:31.56]Black goes to B. Okay.
[124:33.53]Cut that.
[124:34.97]Next.
[124:35.15]Yes.
[124:36.29]Yes.
[124:38.03]Okay.
[124:38.29]We have red, black, black.
[124:41.09]Red goes to A. Does the second one go to B?
[124:45.72]Yes.
[124:47.96]Skip that one.
[124:48.60]And the third one.
[124:50.92]Skip this one.
[124:51.38]Skip the one.
[124:51.85]Go to the next one.
[124:52.71]Okay.
[124:52.91]We have two black wires.
[124:55.53]Okay, uh, does the third one go to A?
[124:59.31]No, third one goes to B. Two black wires, third one goes to B. Okay, skip that.
[125:02.03]Okay, does the fourth one go to C?
[125:05.36]Skip this one, skip this one, fuck it.
[125:13.30]Last one is to C. Black wire in the middle is to C. What number, what number?
[125:18.21]Got it.
[125:24.67]How many seconds were left?
[125:26.05]0.28.
[125:26.13]Oh, God.
[125:36.76]I don't know if my fucking nerves can take this.
[125:40.04]0.28.
[125:40.72]3 tenths of a second.
[125:44.60]Holy shit.
[125:47.69]That was, um... That was a...
[125:50.97]was tricky you know you know what you just did Jerma wild guest until I got it right you you you made a Hollywood move like you did some sort of like Hollywood where you're like you're sweating sweat coming on your face you're like what wire is it just rip them all out you know oh that was wild hey we beat the gear check though no that's true
[126:15.46]So what are we looking at now?
[126:17.61]That's why that's the gear check, because the next one is also five modules, but here's the difference.
[126:25.15]It's two minutes and 30 seconds instead of five minutes.
[126:32.97]So the exact same thing we just did, but we have a full 50% less time.
[126:40.95]I wonder how the modules are.
[126:42.34]I'll tell you what, though.
[126:44.14]Before we do that one,
[126:45.70]Can we do another practice round by IE instead of doing the mission here?
[126:50.07]How about we do a free play and we clock up the time a little bit or something like that?
[126:53.67]Not a bad idea.
[126:56.09]Because I feel like if we're going to tackle a challenge like that, we need a little bit, you know, extra.
[127:01.01]That's too much.
[127:03.64]What do these mean?
[127:04.18]Oh, people are saying it's easier.
[127:06.90]Let me see.
[127:08.52]Oh, it's easier modules.
[127:09.68]It's not hard modules apparently.
[127:12.50]Apparently it's like a bunch of really easy ones.
[127:16.77]Yeah, they say it's not hard ones, it's easy modules.
[127:20.23]Okay, well, I think we can do that one.
[127:21.70]I think we can do that one.
[127:22.70]See, if it just, Simon, says shit, fine.
[127:25.22]But when it comes down to, like... Wire ones, the horizontal wires.
[127:29.08]The occurrence has fucked me up.
[127:31.20]The occurrence has fucked me up, because, uh... Basically, I'm unsure of myself, because I have to do definitive answers.
[127:38.36]I can't just say, eh.
[127:39.76]And I have to be like, okay, what was it?
[127:40.92]What was it?
[127:41.40]And I have to just, like, manually think, you know?
[127:43.46]So...
[127:45.03]actually hilarious that it took us about an hour and a half to do the first two or three missions in the game and it's been two hours and we have done what like eight missions well uh you know I think we found I really I yeah I think I think me being the reading man and you being the fucking cowboy here with the Bruce willis the bomb defusal shit yes I think I think it works

[128:32.30]Regular wires.
[128:32.76]How many do we have?
[128:33.68]It's six wires.

[128:42.51]We have two yellows.
[128:43.39]The first wire is yellow.
[128:44.65]The last wire is red.
[128:45.99]Four red, two yellow.
[128:48.69]So we have... Okay.

[130:09.63]One... They're both blue.
[130:12.11]One button says hold.
[130:13.47]One button says press.
[130:14.55]Both blue buttons.
[130:16.45]Okay.
[130:16.83]Do we have any batteries?

[130:40.98]Four in the position.
[130:41.52]Four in the position.
[130:42.18]Four in the position.
[130:43.81]We did it.
[130:45.30]I was trying to save us like two seconds.
[130:47.22]What the fuck?
[130:48.00]You can't do that!
[130:48.88]I was trying to save us a second and catch it on the tenth of a second.
[130:51.04]Like 0.4.
[130:51.16]You almost saved us- saved our skeletons out of our fucking skin.
[130:56.05]I was trying to do like the 0.4.
[130:57.47]That would've been so cool.
[130:59.13]People would've thought I was aw- people would've thought I was awesome if I did.
[131:03.75]Yeah, we got it first try.
[131:05.74]Jerma, have you ever drank mug before?
[131:08.46]Mug?
[131:10.24]It's a root beer.
[131:10.94]Mug root beer, yeah.
[131:11.98]I've had it.
[131:13.08]What do you think of it?
[131:14.92]I think it's the best root beer, but you can't find it anywhere.
[131:16.84]They don't sell it anywhere.
[131:18.26]Really?
[131:18.62]Yeah, I love mug.
[131:19.46]Are you serious?
[131:20.50]I love mug root beer.
[131:21.14]They don't sell it anywhere.
[131:22.82]Oh, because a lot of people say that mug is a really bad tasting root beer compared to like berries.
[131:28.26]No, it's like some other, like franks or berries.
[131:31.30]Barks.
[131:31.98]Barks is good too.
[131:33.70]I love mug.
[131:34.10]Okay, but bark is better.
[131:35.86]Barks is better than mug, but I like mug, but I can't buy it anywhere because they don't sell it anymore.
[131:40.67]How about this, Jerma?
[131:42.35]At some point in the future, would you like a culinary snack exchange?
[131:46.23]Because I would die for some mug.
[131:48.77]Don't ask me why, but if I send you weird Swedish weird shit brands that you cannot get in America, would I be able to get Bostonian root beer?
[131:57.57]Yeah, if you knew somebody that currently lived in Boston.
[132:03.72]Oh yeah, you want anything from Las Vegas?
[132:08.70]What do you have in Las Vegas?
[132:09.76]Do they have like Elvis Cola or something like that?
[132:11.92]Elvis Cola, yeah.
[132:13.00]Copyright Elvis Cola.
[132:15.16]I don't know.
[132:16.02]I fucking don't live there.
[132:18.26]Elvis Cola.
[132:21.31]I can send you some Sprite.
[132:24.25]Do you like Sprite?
[132:25.19]Do you have Sprite over there?
[132:27.09]Bitch.
[132:28.87]I've never drank that one before.
[132:31.76]Do you have Sprite in Sweden?
[132:35.05]Yes, Jerma.
[132:35.55]We have Sprite here.
[132:36.47]Alright.
[132:36.87]What about... Do you guys have... You guys got Arby's?
[132:42.12]You got Arby's in Sweden?
[132:44.18]Arby's?
[132:44.78]No.
[132:45.14]Well... I'll send you a double meat turkey sandwich.
[132:48.24]I'll send you a double meat turkey sandwich extra mayo.
[132:50.66]How about this?
[132:52.48]You send me that.
[132:53.68]I will eat it on stream in... Okay.
[132:56.56]On one condition, right?
[132:58.32]I'll do it.
[132:59.04]But on one condition.
[133:00.46]I get to send you Swedish fish.
[133:04.38]Yeah, I can't get those.
[133:05.94]Dude, if you know anything about Arby's, every sandwich I've ever had from Arby's, I've only had a few.
[133:10.90]It's like somebody, while the sandwich is in the wrapper, put as much meat and as much condiments on it as possible, and then rolled it out with a fucking rolling pin.
[133:19.57]Jerb, can you explain Hooters to me?
[133:22.11]Um... You don't have those?
[133:24.09]No.
[133:26.93]It's a restaurant where... It's a restaurant that's based around... Can you say yes or no to this?
[133:32.76]Hooters is a strip club that serves you spaghetti.
[133:36.08]No.
[133:36.50]No.
[133:36.86]No.
[133:37.32]No.
[133:37.74]No.
[133:38.22]No.
[133:39.88]No.
[133:44.08]So what is it?
[133:44.50]Hooters is a restaurant that... Okay.
[133:47.44]It's known for... And by the way, they're changing their name and their whole approach.
[133:53.95]They're changing it to, like, Hoots now.
[133:57.26]It's now going to be Hoots, from what I've been told.
[134:00.74]And they're going to change it.
[134:02.48]They're not going to have, like, the girls in, like, the Hooters out, like, shirts and, like, sneakers and stuff.
[134:08.80]Okay.
[134:10.53]Who told you this?
[134:12.95]I'm just curious, because...
[134:15.46]You know, I see these American brands and I'm thinking, what do Americans think?
[134:19.52]Okay, now that we played American football, my good friend, let us hit up Hooters and eat some chicken wings with buffalo sauce, my good friend.
[134:27.87]Well, I mean, that's kind of like a cartoon way to look at an American.
[134:32.12]But no, no.
[134:34.82]We roll our sandwiches out with rolling pins and then we eat them covered in mayonnaise.
[134:43.93]not wrong it's that's wrong that is wrong I I I don't go to Hooters in fact they're closing them no they're closing them all down okay well what is what is your favorite uh chain restaurant in America I'm asking this for for a cultural culinary knowledge exchange that's not that's not funny in America best fast food in America uh
[135:12.67]I don't know.
[135:15.00]I love McDonald's.
[135:17.24]I really do.
[135:18.48]I actually really love McDonald's.
[135:20.98]What's your favorite thing at McDonald's?
[135:23.78]That simple McChicken.
[135:26.70]Just a plain McChicken or McDoubles.
[135:29.88]The McDoubles is the fucking best deal.
[135:32.80]How do you feel about those sesame seed regular cheeseburgers, the small ones for like a dollar?
[135:38.08]Sure, yeah.
[135:40.04]Okay, here's the thing.
[135:41.28]Those are less than a dollar.
[135:42.50]Sometimes when I buy games on Steam, on stream, stuff like that, and it's a waste.
[135:45.90]It's a waste of time and whatever.
[135:47.98]I equate my losses in how many cheeseburgers could I have gotten at McDonald's versus buying this game.
[135:54.17]Yeah, the standard McDonald's cheeseburger is probably the best one.
[135:58.05]Yeah, for sure.
[135:58.73]Yeah.
[136:00.61]Well, why the fuck are we talking about?
[136:01.99]We should be solving problems.
[136:03.05]Sorry.
[136:03.41]Well, it's a nice little segue.
[136:05.21]McDonald's is overrated, but it's good.
[136:08.10]But I'll tell you what.
[136:09.80]I'll tell you what.
[136:10.86]What is the worst place to go if you're hungry in a fast food situation?
[136:14.00]Burger King sucks.
[136:14.72]Burger King is terrible.
[136:16.42]Really?
[136:16.84]Burger King is dog shit.
[136:18.14]Like Taco Bell.
[136:19.09]Somebody said Taco Bell.
[136:19.97]Taco Bell is like one of my favorite places.
[136:22.43]But Burger King sucks.
[136:23.51]It really doesn't.
[136:24.35]Doesn't Burger King have that like, you know, they had a commercial with Return of the Mac.
[136:28.29]You know, Burger King, Mac and Cheetos, whatever.
[136:32.13]But you eat one and then you go, that was kind of good.
[136:34.13]And you eat a second one and you go, I don't want these ever again.
[136:36.55]And you don't order them ever again.
[136:38.44]Burger King has this thing where they make a menu item that you will order once and never fucking order ever again.
[136:44.36]It's half their menu.
[136:46.10]Oh, we got like the chicken Cheetos, the chicken fries, the Cheetos fries, the cheese, the mac and cheese bombs.
[136:52.24]You eat it once and you never fucking order it again.
[136:53.93]And half the menu goes uneaten.
[136:54.93]Jerma.
[136:56.12]Jeremiah, I just thought of something amazing.
[136:58.27]I've been talking about something on stream for years.
[137:00.95]Heart Attack Grill.
[137:02.93]You live in Vegas now.
[137:04.45]Do you know about this?
[137:05.41]Do you weigh over 350 pounds?
[137:08.35]Do I sound like I do?
[137:09.23]I don't know.
[137:11.33]No.
[137:14.53]If you weigh over 350 pounds, you eat everything for free at the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas.
[137:22.73]It is free.
[137:23.81]Your meal is free.

[137:26.51]I have never been to... I have walked by it many times.
[137:29.63]But I have never been inside the restaurant.
[137:32.51]I'll tell you what.
[137:33.43]I'll tell you what.
[137:35.15]This is a question for Jerma chat.

[137:59.92]People get surprised whenever I eat food around people.
[138:03.02]Okay, Mr. Big Shove, I'll tell you what.
[138:04.70]Let's put your money where your mouth is.
[138:07.99]Let's head down to Heart Attack Grill and let's obliterate 15 plates of fries and let's see who truly is a gamer.
[138:16.37]You ready?
[138:18.14]Well, maybe not now, but at some point.
[138:20.02]I can eat a lot of food.
[138:21.84]I can eat a lot of food.
[138:22.90]I told you my order.
[138:24.27]Everybody in my chat knows the order.
[138:26.35]They know my order and they think it's a joke.
[138:28.09]And I've told them it's a Big Mac, number one, two McChickens, and two double cheeseburgers.
[138:34.01]And I eat it every time in a large fry and a large soda.
[138:38.62]And a large soda?
[138:39.44]Yes.
[138:40.66]And extra dip?
[138:42.22]Extra dip.

[139:10.04]I just pictured you, like, vomiting into your friend's mouth after you've been eating so much.
[139:14.32]I don't know why the fuck, whatever.
[139:15.75]The point being, I have a bet for you.
[139:17.87]I have a bet for you.
[139:18.67]Okay.
[139:19.57]I'll hear it.
[139:21.39]And you may decline, and there's nothing bad about it.
[139:24.49]That if we can solve the next bomb, even though we've been challenged at this, you will at some point, as a joke or whatever it is, go to Heart Attack Grill, you don't have to overeat, just go there and be like... And just be a patron of the Heart Attack Grill.
[139:39.08]Right now.
[139:40.36]Just show them the world.
[139:41.98]Do I have to stream going to the heart attack realm?
[139:45.98]No, you can film it or do whatever you want.
[139:47.66]Just to be like, I have the privilege of living in Elvis town.
[139:52.54]And now I'm having an Elvis burger, you know.
[139:56.73]Would you like to do this?
[139:57.93]Here's the thing though, here's the thing.
[139:59.07]If we fuck up, there's no need to do this.
[140:01.35]But if we win...
[140:02.96]But if we win... If we win... How about this?
[140:07.63]This sounds like a losing scenario.
[140:09.41]Like if you lose, you have to do this.
[140:12.09]Okay.
[140:12.37]Well... Okay.
[140:14.41]But here's the thing.
[140:14.97]We are guaranteed to lose.
[140:16.11]I'm saying if by some chance... And we have to play straight.
[140:20.65]Yeah.
[140:20.79]We're guaranteed to lose.
[140:22.48]Okay, but if we win, you have to just eat an Elvis burger.
[140:26.32]Alright, if we win, I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[140:29.26]I will actually fall out of here.
[140:31.18]If we win, I will go to the hard tech room, and I will have a photo of me taken in this restaurant with a hamburger in my face, and it'll be like, here, I'm eating a hamburger.
[140:43.79]Here, I'm eating a hamburger at a restaurant.
[140:46.51]Okay.
[140:46.91]We have to do it first.
[140:50.04]Okay, but what position are we on?
[140:52.69]We are on no room for error.
[140:54.01]We have one strike and it's over.
[140:58.32]Alright.
[141:00.14]So if we, so I get it.
[141:01.74]If we lose, it's over.
[141:04.52]Maybe we win.
[141:06.17]Oh mama.
[141:06.75]If we win, I go, I take a photo of eating the hamburger.
[141:09.57]Whoa.
[141:09.83]Whoop-dee-doo.
[141:10.33]There you go.
[141:12.67]You ready?
[141:12.93]Mm-hmm.
[141:16.74]We have regular wires.
[141:18.60]There are six.
[141:19.22]Regular wires.
[141:19.62]How many?
[141:20.14]How many?
[141:20.72]Six wires.
[141:21.98]Two white.
[141:23.64]Two red.
[141:24.17]A black and a blue.
[141:25.37]Is the serial number odd?
[141:26.27]Is the serial number odd?
[141:27.47]Is the serial number odd?
[141:29.13]The serial number is even.
[141:31.21]You're talking about the last number, right?
[141:33.85]Mm-hmm.
[141:34.21]Yes.
[141:34.41]It's even.
[141:35.88]Okay.
[141:36.20]It's even.
[141:36.94]So, is there... There was no yellow wires, you said?
[141:39.62]No yellow wires.

[157:50.74]Press the button in the third position.
[157:57.38]Two.
[157:59.27]Press the button in the same position as you pressed in stage one.
[158:02.31]I'm so fucking nervous.
[158:07.49]Three.
[158:09.33]Press the button in the third position.
[158:10.99]Okay.
[158:15.28]Three.
[158:17.10]Press the button in the same position as you pressed in stage two.
[158:20.12]Okay.

[158:34.84]Now, I'm gonna ask you, chat.
[158:37.14]Was that on me?
[158:39.48]Was it on Jerma?
[158:40.44]No, they were all three.
[158:42.96]When did I press the... It was three like three times.
[158:46.57]Okay, I'll deduct something.
[158:49.29]Our weaknesses and strengths, you are platinum at the password, but the memory thing... It's not even memory, it's remembering.
[159:00.10]So it's four numbers that you have to remember out of order, and then, like, it's the position and the labels.
[159:07.22]I can't do it.
[159:08.24]I ate Captain Crunch every day when I was, like, from 8 to fucking 14.
[159:12.29]So, like, I don't have the capability to remember that shit.
[159:14.55]Jerma, what did you just say?
[159:17.00]It's not memory.
[159:17.84]It's... It's what?
[159:23.29]Quote... Say that again.
[159:27.99]No, I can remember lots of things.
[159:29.87]I remember lots of shit.
[159:32.25]No, no, no.
[159:32.87]You said... It's not memory.
[159:36.02]It's remembering.
[159:38.02]No, it's not memory.
[159:39.68]Dot, dot, dot, dot.
[159:40.64]End quote.
[159:41.18]New quote.
[159:42.26]New quote.
[159:43.66]New quote.
[159:44.96]It's about remembering the sequence.

[160:32.88]Okay.
[160:33.70]There are no yellow wires, and the last date of the serial number is odd.
[160:36.02]They cut the third wire, which you're not gonna do.
[160:37.94]No.
[160:38.22]There are six wires, and there's one white, three red... There's no yellow wires.

[161:18.95]Three.
[161:22.25]Press the button in the first position.
[161:26.82]Would it help if you wrote this down, maybe?
[161:28.38]I don't know.
[161:29.00]One.
[161:29.30]I can't write shit down.
[161:31.24]The number is 1.

[164:55.55]My heart did not skip a beat.
[164:57.38]It was just like, do-dunk.
[165:00.10]And then it just stopped, and now it can pump blood again.
[165:04.40]You're maligned about a hamburger in underwear.

[169:19.24]It says, take your time, relax.
[169:21.28]Then it says, don't relax.
[169:22.37]If we can do this in one minute each, no problem.

[169:30.03]There's no stakes here.
[169:30.95]It's just a matter of, can we clear this monstrosity?

[188:02.32]Yep.
[188:03.82]Up, up, up?
[188:05.16]Yep.
[188:05.98]Left?
[188:06.66]Yep.
[188:06.76]All the way down?
[188:07.80]Done.
[188:08.94]We have a red button that says hold.
[188:11.02]Red button that says hold.
[188:12.02]By the way, there are two batteries.
[188:16.89]Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[188:18.75]Red button that says hold.
[188:21.69]Two batteries.
[188:22.19]Okay, hang on.
[188:23.79]If there are two more batteries and there's... If the button is red and the button says hold, right?
[188:29.41]Yes.
[188:29.97]Press and immediately release.
[188:32.01]Good.
[188:32.42]Over.
[188:33.26]Regular wires.
[188:34.96]Yeah.
[188:35.92]Six wires.
[188:39.28]Two white.
[188:41.32]One blue.
[188:41.84]It's exactly one yellow wire and there's more than one...
[188:45.05]Okay, so there is one yellow wire, and there are two white wires.
[188:48.35]And that's the only thing that has... White's the only thing that has more than one.
[188:50.51]Exactly one yellow wire, and there are more than one white wire.
[188:52.81]Yes.
[188:53.99]Cut the fourth wire.
[188:56.42]Done.
[188:56.58]Okay.
[188:57.50]Now, we've got a complicated one.
[188:59.44]It's the sideways, horizontal, complex wires one.
[189:02.20]Okay, let's kick some ass at this one.
[189:03.52]Let's kick some ass.
[189:04.10]Here we go.
[189:05.38]Alright, so red.
[189:06.51]Red, the first one, is going to... Red.
[189:09.21]Red is the first wire.
[189:10.17]It's going to C. Cut it.
[189:12.78]Blue is the second wire.
[189:13.70]It's going to be.
[189:14.42]It's in the third slot.
[189:15.24]So three to be.
[189:16.72]Cut it.
[189:17.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[189:18.82]I just, I did.
[189:19.28]I got it.
[189:19.74]Okay.
[189:20.97]Sorry.
[189:22.37]Good.
[189:22.81]Go.
[189:23.07]Next one.
[189:23.37]Next one.
[189:23.79]Next one.
[189:24.59]We have our second red wire and second blue wire, but our first black wire here.
[189:28.83]So the first red wire is going to C.
[189:31.53]Cut the black wire.
[189:32.59]Cut the black wire.
[189:33.43]Okay.
[189:33.69]The blue one.
[189:34.77]The blue one is the second one, right?
[189:36.29]Or the first one.
[189:37.03]First one, right?
[189:37.47]The blue one is the second wire.
[189:40.70]No, no, no.
[189:41.20]The blue one.
[189:41.90]The blue one is the third wire, I believe, of this sequence here.
[189:45.52]Okay.
[189:45.88]Is it the first occurrence we see in blue?
[189:47.68]No.
[189:48.08]This is the second time we've seen a blue wire.
[189:50.00]It's going from 5 to C. Yes, it is.
[189:51.78]Is it going to C?
[189:52.22]Cut it.
[189:52.92]Okay.
[189:55.44]Yes.
[189:56.32]Keep going?
[189:57.58]Yes.
[189:57.76]Okay.
[189:59.41]Here we have our third blue wire and two black wires.
[190:03.45]Is it going to... B or A?
[190:06.63]It's going to C. The blue wire is going to C. Third time we see... Ignore that.
[190:09.91]Ignore that one.
[190:10.71]Two black wires.
[190:11.85]One going to B, one going to C. And this would be the second black wire, right?
[190:15.99]This would be the... Let's see.
[190:18.61]This is the second and third black wire here.
[190:22.81]One's going to C, one's going to B. The first one's going to C.
[190:26.81]Cut the one that goes to C. Okay.
[190:30.71]And does the... Does the third one go to B?
[190:34.61]Yes, it does.
[190:35.51]Okay, cut that one too.
[190:36.49]Okay.
[190:37.67]Last one.
[190:38.55]We have a black wire and a blue wire.
[190:40.39]11 to C, both going to C.
[190:42.07]11 and 12, both going to C. Blue wire and black wire.
[190:45.44]Blue wire would be what in terms of occurrence?
[190:47.64]So this would be the 1, 2, 3, 4th blue wire.
[190:54.32]Does it go to A?
[190:55.12]Goes to C.
[190:56.66]Skip it.
[190:58.04]Nope.
[190:59.34]Cut the black wire.
[190:59.84]Cut the black wire.
[191:00.74]Done?
[191:01.98]Yes.
[191:02.88]We did it.
[191:05.88]Oh, we had plenty of time.
[191:06.86]We had plenty.
[191:07.88]42 seconds.
[191:08.20]We had plenty of time?
[191:10.14]Yeah, we had like 42 seconds.
[191:11.78]That felt like fucking 25 minutes.
[191:13.52]Yeah, I thought we had like 10 seconds left.
[191:16.34]Jesus.
[191:18.14]Oh my god.
[191:18.62]Nice work.
[191:20.86]That was good.
[191:24.06]Dude, I'm fucking exhausted.
[191:25.16]That was fucking wild.
[191:28.46]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[191:29.64]I can't imagine how much more difficult this game gets.
[191:31.08]All I can say is... Dude, I can tell you one thing.
[191:35.16]We sure got way better at this than the fucking first stream.
[191:37.66]Yes.
[191:37.74]My god.
[191:40.18]Wow.
[191:42.54]That was fun.
[191:43.00]Dude, I'm like... It feels like I've been running a marathon.
[191:46.53]Like, I'm physically exhausted.
[191:47.73]I've just been sitting down.
[191:49.21]But it's been like a... I've actually been nervous this time.
[191:52.17]Like, holy shit, man.
[191:54.73]I'm like sweating.
[191:56.11]Somebody said this would be funny.
[191:57.19]Do you want to preview the next one just to see what the fuck is ahead of us?
[192:00.00]What is needy?
[192:02.12]This is a new mechanic.
[192:04.08]Something is different about this bomb and it demands attention.
[192:08.24]Apparently this bomb is needy.
[192:11.92]Somebody said we should hook ourselves up to small electric devices that give us small shocks if we blow it.
[192:18.34]That would be like death penalty.
[192:20.18]That's electrical chair, man.
[192:21.30]That's like TOS.
[192:23.37]You ever seen the Green Mile?
[192:26.54]Ah, yes, Ev.
[192:27.10]Alright, what's this?
[192:29.23]Okay, so what the fuck are we looking at?
[192:30.63]Okay, so apparently there's a new module here that has, like, a bop-it.
[192:34.55]There's, like, a pull-it, twist-it, measure-it.
[192:37.09]Oh, yeah, I got it, too.
[192:41.53]It says, discharge the capacitor before it overloads by holding down the lever.
[192:46.94]So, if I hold this down... Okay.
[192:49.78]I don't know what any of this means.
[192:54.32]I think, and the word is needy, right?
[192:57.06]I mean, needy is just the name of the bomb now.
[192:59.90]It's like the type of bomb it is.
[193:01.18]I think this means that when we're going to do this next string question mark, I don't fucking know.
[193:05.83]I think this is going to build up a danger factor and we have to like keep on being like, no, go down, go done.
[193:12.19]You know, we can't.
[193:13.19]I think we have to like discharge it or something.
[193:18.10]oh okay well I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I think how long have we been streaming just curious like three hours 15 minutes I I'm I'm fine with that I I think we can call it here okay any more than this and I I would have been like dude just blow it up we're but here's here's how is this not oh actually that's how let me see what you're doing on screen hang on uh okay you ready can you imagine doing this start press start press start

[194:38.30]Let's try that insane mode one more time.
[194:42.54]Wait.
[194:43.38]We can't do that.
[194:44.08]Let's see if we can solve one completely randomly.
[194:48.23]You want to try to solve one?
[194:49.27]Alright.
[194:49.43]Let's try to solve.
[194:50.07]If we solve one, then I'll eat four.
[194:52.99]I'll eat something.
[194:53.77]No.
[194:53.99]No.
[194:54.35]No.
[194:54.47]No.
[194:54.77]No.
[194:54.95]We have enough salmonella for a lifetime.
[194:56.65]Alright.

[194:57.41]Ready?
[194:57.59]Okay.

[195:29.93]Okay.
[195:31.36]We saw one.
[195:32.04]I was just trying to guess.
[195:33.34]We got it.
[195:40.10]Holy shit.
[195:41.16]How would anybody... There are probably speedrunners that can do this shit in 5-10 seconds.
[195:44.62]Dude, imagine getting so fucking good at this, you don't even depend on somebody.
[195:47.79]You just remember from just like... You just do it.
[195:50.33]Algorithmic like, you know... Somebody... Oh, by the way, I forgot about this.
[195:56.03]Somebody emailed me.
[195:57.57]There is a mod for this game called Speed.
[196:01.84]Speed?
[196:02.26]It's a multiplayer mod.
[196:03.90]You've seen the movie Speed?
[196:04.80]Uh-huh.
[196:07.48]So many modded ins that someone, you have to drive the bus with A and D and always go around 80 miles per hour or else it explodes.
[196:16.17]Why didn't we do this?
[196:17.37]Why didn't we do this one?
[196:18.55]This looks awesome.
[196:21.47]I'll tell you what.
[196:22.17]I'll tell you what.
[196:23.65]Next one.
[196:24.39]Next time.
[196:24.75]We'll do speed.
[196:25.47]Next one.
[196:26.87]And I'll tell you what.
[196:28.63]Let's get a bunch of mods next time.
[196:30.47]Let's download, you know.
[196:31.89]You want to fuck it up?
[196:32.51]A bunch of crap.
[196:36.08]Well, I'll tell you what, man.
[196:38.08]This was a lot of fun.
[196:39.20]And I think the stream went way better now that we're sitting down and we're like, let's be very serious.
[196:45.83]But this was a lot of fun, man.
[196:47.05]This was a very fun stream.
[196:48.47]And I can breathe now.
[196:50.97]But a lot of fun, man.
[196:52.51]A lot of fun.
[196:54.59]Yeah, we'll probably see you again soon.
[196:56.83]Thanks for hanging out, Joel.
[196:59.15]We're squad stream, so people can just look to the right and see your channel.
[197:03.95]Absolutely.
[197:05.33]Always give Joel a follow.
[197:06.39]He's a fucking great dude.
[197:07.31]And we'll see you again.
[197:11.70]Whenever.
[197:12.02]Yeah, absolutely.
[197:13.08]Hit me up and I'll wake up at 3am and...
[197:19.76]Your sleep schedule is crazy.
[197:20.76]Have sand in my ass and be like, knocking over cans like, I got a diffuse bomb.
[197:27.14]You got cans in your room too?
[197:29.74]Wow.
[197:29.82]Look at how similar we are, guys.
[197:31.02]Look at this.
[197:32.31]What are you saying?
[197:33.43]What are you saying?
[197:35.01]Except one of us is funny.
[197:36.79]But that's not me, by the way.
[197:38.85]Which one?
[197:40.11]No, you are.
[197:41.07]Okay, listen.
[197:41.59]No.
[197:42.97]No.
[197:44.06]uh anyway my point being my point being uh I uh I had a blast and uh now that we know how all these modules work uh now we can drive and yeah the only thing we have to be a little better at is we have to uh I have well you don't need any practice on the password module but I'll say this the memory is really difficult and
[198:11.90]I suggest maybe next stream get like a like a note thing or something to just be like yeah that's not cheating because um it's you know fucking when I do math in real life I'm like I had to write shit you know what I'm gonna get the thing I have this thing where I can draw on my screen I'm just gonna get that oh me too me too hang on hang on check this bad boy out hang on uh you got one yeah they're pretty they're awesome I've used them before
[198:42.19]pencil no no no no like the the pen that you can just draw on the screen so I can be like okay one and then two three four you should race desert bus with Joel uh that's how do you race desert bus don't you just go the same speed on the same road that don't work it's a race
[199:17.52]take my stream man oh you you let me see let me see what you're doing yeah yeah yeah you can draw kind of well you know to draw it's a photo dude you didn't just draw that I'll see you next week uh hopefully whenever we uh
[199:41.88]Whenever we cross paths again.
[199:44.88]But once again, thank you for having me on the stream.
[199:48.14]I hope that our... Us playing this a little bit better.
[199:53.78]Add a little more quality to the stream.
[199:55.10]But, you know... Hey, the last one was quality too.
[199:59.48]We were learning.
[199:59.94]The last one was quality, but with 15 quotation marks.
[200:02.92]That's true.
[200:03.46]But now, we're in a little different league, I think.
[200:05.88]But regardless, thank you so much for having me, man.
[200:07.90]And, you know...
[200:09.25]I hope next time we can, uh, we can breeze through it even more in an accelerated pace.
[200:13.14]So, uh.
[200:13.98]That was a lot of fun.
[200:14.54]Absolutely.
[200:15.67]Yeah, absolutely.
[200:16.25]We'll see you later, dude.
[200:16.99]Well, uh, see y'all later and, uh.
[200:19.13]Have a good sleep.
[200:19.99]Well, actually, no, you just woke up, didn't you?
[200:23.07]Yeah, but, you know, I'll probably eat two raw eggs later on and I'll fucking have salmonella and, like, hawk out for a week.
[200:27.63]But anyway, yeah, speaking about that, you, listen, that's not my prerogative anymore.
[200:34.70]You check out whenever you are going to go to Heart Attack Grill and eat onion rings that will give you, like, biblical diarrhea.
[200:43.64]So, you know.
[200:44.44]I don't know.
[200:45.76]Yeah, probably.
[200:48.05]I don't know.
[200:48.55]But regardless, thank you for having me, man.
[200:52.73]Thanks for having me, too.

[202:58.16]50 fucking dollars.
[202:58.78]Yeah, no, we're still going to do the end of the stream.
[203:02.68]We're still going to hang out.
[203:08.03]5,000 bits.
[203:09.09]Let me just pull up my bit device here.
[203:12.65]Here it is.
[203:15.65]Uh, it's Dryski.
[203:16.71]They say, hey, Jerma, it's my birthday today.

[203:24.73]Thank you, Dryski.
[203:26.67]Happy birthday.

[203:41.42]Have a great birthday.
[203:42.20]It feels birthday, man.
[203:46.40]Jerma induced a heart attack.
[203:49.56]I love the idea of Jerma, but the execution is just, you know, it's lacking sometimes.
[203:54.56]It's lacking.
[203:56.27]No, thanks a lot, man.
[203:59.59]But, let's go over, let's go over, let's put the cam on for this.
[204:03.53]Just so, because, you know, obviously, I'm not really playing the exploding game anymore, but I'll just go right in the middle.
[204:09.44]So, there you go, you guys are right here.
[204:13.76]So, over the course of the next couple weeks,
[204:18.59]I have some doctor's appointments, and I also have some old friends, some hometown friends that are coming up to visit Vegas.
[204:27.47]And they're going to spend some time here.
[204:29.88]So we're going to do a few kind of one day off, one day on, two day... Hear me out on this one.
[204:37.96]So I will be back on Sunday.
[204:41.94]I will be back on Sunday.
[204:44.26]We're gonna stream on Sunday, so that's the 26th.
[204:46.82]And then I'm gonna be off on the 20... What just happened?
[204:50.60]Oh, okay.
[204:51.44]I'm gonna be off on the 27th.
[204:54.60]And then... We are going to go... Five days in a row.
[205:01.35]We are gonna do... Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[205:05.13]We're doing five days in a row.
[205:07.33]Because...
[205:09.40]The week after that, the next week, that first, second week of February, I'm not going to be live for more than probably once or twice a week.
[205:19.24]So, we are going to do five days in a row as of this coming Tuesday.
[205:23.81]But, again, you'll see me again on Sunday, nothing on Monday, and then five days in a row until I take some time off.
[205:32.63]It's not going to be Diablo.
[205:35.03]No, we have a lot of games to play.
[205:36.33]It's not going to be fucking Diablo.
[205:37.83]What's wrong with my hair?
[205:40.43]It's painted on.
[205:43.59]I mean, it's a little bit of this.
[205:46.33]Yeah.
[205:49.77]When's community content night part two?
[205:51.46]That's actually a really, really great question.
[205:53.02]That's a great question.
[205:54.86]That's going to happen on probably Sunday.
[206:00.52]Because that's when I said I was going to have this coming weekend, right?
[206:03.78]So we'll do that on Sunday.
[206:05.06]That'll be part two of community content night.
[206:09.12]Uh, that will be a quick one, so we'll do something else.
[206:12.25]We'll do Community Content Night, and then we'll bleed into something else.
[206:17.45]But that's the schedule for the next couple weeks, because I'm taking a lot of time off that first week of February.
[206:23.75]Don't point at me.
[206:24.90]I told you, I'm like a fucking... I like to cast spells when I talk.
[206:31.94]But, uh, that's it for tonight.
[206:34.84]See you guys in a couple days, on Sunday.
[206:38.56]And that's it.
[206:40.58]Shorter stream tonight, I know, but my brain is a little... I mean, he was right when he said that after doing that, it's almost like I need to go eat and just relax for a while.
[206:53.12]Signing off.
[206:54.06]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[206:56.78]Well, let's do the end of the stream.
[206:58.00]Let's hang out for a little bit.
[206:59.50]As always.
[206:59.82]I'm not just going to leave.
[207:03.90]When's the rumble?
[207:04.87]Yes, there's going to be a charity rumble.
[207:07.71]I haven't talked that much about it, but I've talked enough about it for you guys to know.
[207:11.69]The next rumble is going to be a charity rumble.
[207:17.53]It's going to be to sponsor one of my closest friends' Boston Marathon run.
[207:24.09]So all the money that comes in during that stream, there's going to be a special link to donate to raise the money to sponsor his run.
[207:35.72]That should be really fun.
[207:36.46]And that's probably going to happen...
[207:39.21]Somewhere in February into March.
[207:43.91]That's when it's planned, at least.
[207:46.85]Because obviously the... The... The marathon is in April, so we kind of have to do it before then, because obviously he needs to be sponsored before then.
[207:57.72]Yo, Joel, why are you eating chips?
[208:06.05]Why, though?
[208:09.04]Why what?
[208:11.06]Why do a charity stream?
[208:16.29]I don't know.
[208:16.81]I don't follow you.
[208:20.37]But why though?
[208:21.99]Hey, but why though?
[208:29.46]But yeah, that's the plan.
[208:31.92]Let's rewind the clock a little bit.
[208:34.49]Let's do the bits.
[208:38.65]Thank you to Ewordtwirtywordtwirt for the 250.
[208:40.57]It's been a while since I've said that name out loud.
[208:43.45]One of my favorite names.
[208:45.39]I love saying it.
[208:46.03]Ewordtwirtywordtwirt.
[208:47.88]It's 250.
[208:52.46]We had 10 community subs from SuperBruce.
[208:54.64]I caught it, but again, thank you, Bruce.
[209:02.25]Much love to you.
[209:03.43]Again, Ewordtwirtywordtwirt gave 250 bits.
[209:07.59]Jerma, please play Halo M when it comes out on PC, or I'll fly to America and sign a petition to ban you.
[209:12.33]Why do you have to fly to America to ban me?
[209:21.53]There's a clip here.
[209:22.79]I know what this clip says, but I did it!
[209:25.23]And it... E-Wort, E-Wort, E-Wort, thanks for the $5.
[209:28.87]Jerma, play Halo on PC, please.
[209:31.57]Thank you.
[209:32.85]Probably.
[209:34.41]I did!
[209:35.72]I don't see why not.
[209:36.56]Probably.
[209:37.22]I did!
[209:37.58]Not tomorrow, not the next day.
[209:40.30]Probably though.
[209:42.30]On legendary mode.
[209:43.42]I did that too!
[209:44.20]Delete that.
[209:45.44]Demons V thanks for the f***.
[209:46.78]I did that too!
[209:54.39]You call what you did playing.
[209:56.59]Yes, I controlled the character and moved around.
[210:07.04]Fucking Halo.
[210:08.06]That's so funny to me.
[210:10.08]It's all good, though.
[210:10.88]Whatever.
[210:14.08]Alright.
[210:14.62]He's gonna ban you in real life.
[210:17.23]How do you get banned in real life?
[210:20.23]Thank you, E-word to word, E-word to word.
[210:21.83]Appreciate it.
[210:24.55]Oh my god, how did I miss $100 from Freddy Dredd?
[210:28.61]How did I miss this?
[210:29.23]This is like the most important message ever.
[210:32.68]Freddy Dredd gave 10,000 bits earlier and they said, I'm at Hash House right now.
[210:36.90]I'm going to order.
[210:37.52]That was like three hours ago.
[210:40.48]God damn it.
[210:47.32]I need to know.
[210:48.02]I have to know.
[210:52.07]You got the blue cheeseburger?
[210:55.27]He's waiting for you.
[210:57.53]He's been waiting for you for three hours.
[211:00.27]You were supposed to go to dinner.
[211:04.72]That's the most important because of the money?
[211:06.04]No, it's the most important because... They went to Hash House Ogogo at the link.
[211:11.65]That's why.
[211:16.07]Literally there.
[211:16.91]They kicked him out.
[211:21.91]Freddy, if you're still here or if you checked back in again, thanks so much for the... Fucking $1,100, $1,200 now.
[211:26.64]Over two days.
[211:28.54]Hope you liked it.
[211:30.36]It's one of my favorite places.
[211:35.99]He wouldn't notice Freddy if he just typed in chat normally.
[211:45.38]Thanks, Freddy.
[211:45.94]Thank you so much.
[211:48.53]Seriously, I hope you liked it.
[211:50.15]I'm kind of nervous.
[211:51.47]What if he comes back and he's like... Dude, that was like a 6 out of 10 at best.
[211:57.34]In fact, like, two of my friends are sick.
[212:01.89]I'm going to be like, oh, shit.
[212:05.37]No, impossible.
[212:06.69]Not possible.
[212:07.27]If you go to Hash, you have to go with the link.
[212:09.35]Not possible.
[212:11.99]It's just a fact.
[212:17.90]But thanks a lot.
[212:18.54]Thank you, I'd ever agree.
[212:21.60]I'd ever agree.
[212:24.37]Is this my f- is this m- The winner is Jerma from District 10.
[212:54.08]People add me as a joke to things and I- and I- and I just win.
[212:57.72]That's the image, apparently.
[213:01.84]Well, add him as a joke.
[213:03.32]Well, don't- you know, I got- now you guys know I take shit dead seriously.
[213:10.57]I'm not far- I don't fuck around.
[213:11.75]You add me to something like that, I'm gonna go for it.
[213:13.41]You know what I'm saying?
[213:25.61]I can't just be jokey, add it in, and not win the whole thing.
[213:31.81]But thanks.
[213:34.33]I'm honored to have won.
[213:35.39]Hey, Noodle is bad at gaming.
[213:38.87]Thanks to the five for the bits.
[213:39.79]Hey, Jerma, I made a funny video.
[213:41.35]Why is there... Oh, sorry.
[213:52.17]Is there a poker tournament going on on the front page of Twitch?
[213:54.62]I don't know.
[213:56.00]I hit the back button and I'm on my Twitch homepage.
[213:59.96]Sorry about that.
[214:02.30]That's not the funny video, I guess.
[214:05.12]There's another one.
[214:05.76]It says here comes another bad Jerma video.
[214:30.72]That's a Halo spoiler.
[214:46.41]Here comes a Halo spoiler.
[214:47.51]For those of you that have ever seen Halo, here comes a spoiler.
[214:59.40]last one is to see black wire in the middle to see how much time was left you don't want to know that's the first level in halo 2. I've I've never seen halo 2 before you spoiled the whole game I can't even play it now uh autumn dragons thanks for the 250 and they say
[215:30.51]This is Morse code.
[215:32.67]Let me just put this into a Morse code translator.
[215:35.07]Make sure this is not something that someone's going to say something fucked up.
[215:46.60]Okay.
[215:50.22]This is what they wrote.
[215:54.64]I can't even write this.
[215:55.42]Why?
[215:55.75]Why?
[216:03.44]So that's Morse code for Jerma Sucks.
[216:10.03]Cool.
[216:13.93]Thanks.
[216:16.55]Hey, appreciate that.
[216:17.32]Hey, Meaty Patty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[216:21.20]Thanks a lot.
[216:25.06]Agent Dark Booty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[216:29.35]Jeremiah, I've only been watching you since 2017, but you're giving me more wheezy laughs than any other e-clown.
[216:36.49]Thanks.
[216:39.07]They say, I hope you don't take chat ribbing you seriously.
[216:41.39]We all love you and it's all in good fun.
[216:44.07]Yeah, I hope you don't take some of the things I say seriously either.
[216:47.55]That's not about putting a hamburger down my underwear.
[216:50.30]That's not real.
[216:51.12]We both say things.
[216:51.96]We're just kidding around.
[216:53.42]Also, I have ADHD and have trouble with motivation sometimes.
[216:56.00]Do you experience this or have you had any tips regarding it?
[216:58.72]Keep it up, dude.
[217:01.62]Um, yeah, all the time.
[217:05.40]The thing that helps for me the most is trying just to focus on one thing at a time.
[217:11.36]Because I can get so spread out and have so many things that I care about that I care about... I have 100% of my brain that cares.
[217:19.90]And if there's 10 things that I want to do, each one of those things will get 10% of my brain.
[217:25.41]Which just, that sucks.
[217:26.87]It fucks everything up.
[217:28.47]You got to do one thing at a time, 100% of your brain power.
[217:34.42]It's easy to be like, well, this, that, that, that, that.
[217:36.90]And then you spread yourself out so much that you're all over the place.
[217:41.21]So I've tried to, at least recently, in the last probably three, four plus years, is just to do one thing at a time and just get it done and do that first.
[217:51.61]Because like, there are, especially if we're talking about just even for streaming, the stuff that I want to do, I have things that I'm starting to want to plan out that are going to be three, four, five plus months from now in 2020.
[218:03.88]But there's other stuff that takes precedence first that's happening now or sooner.
[218:09.06]You got to do it one step at a time.
[218:13.10]It's really easy to get overwhelmed when you overwhelm yourself.
[218:18.30]One at a time.
[218:19.74]But thanks a lot.
[218:21.88]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[218:26.31]XWar2, thanks for the 300 bits.
[218:28.19]Enjoy the dinner date with Kim Jerma.
[218:29.75]This is like my third ever Twitch stream of yours.
[218:32.21]Also, it's pronounced XWar2.
[218:38.36]I think I said XWar2.
[218:40.30]XWar2.
[218:40.68]Thank you.
[218:44.85]Welcome.
[218:45.53]Hope you like it.
[218:46.34]This is the third time you've ever seen a stream.
[218:48.06]I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything else, but... What's going on?
[218:52.62]Thanks for stopping by.
[218:57.79]Maybe we'll see you again.
[219:01.07]Beck Ali.
[219:02.05]Thank Beck Ali, or Beck Ali, for the 400 bits.
[219:06.72]Thanks a lot.
[219:07.90]Yeah, and they're insanely smart, too.
[219:08.86]They're very, very smart animals.
[219:09.66]But whatever you're going through, I'm sorry to hear that.
[219:35.87]Hopefully you can go day by day and start feeling a little better.
[219:41.63]Rats are fucking awesome.
[219:46.29]Year of the rat, too.
[219:47.69]Year of the rat, pet rats.
[219:50.39]Gotta get two, though.
[219:53.72]Otto is a rat terrier.
[219:55.18]That's also not... I didn't make that up.
[219:59.66]He's rat terrier.
[220:05.77]He's 40% Dachshund, 40% Rat Terrier, 10% Shetland Sheepdog, and 10% Chihuahua.
[220:15.01]We got the real data.
[220:19.10]He's an actual rat.
[220:23.70]But thank you, Becca Lee.
[220:25.16]Appreciate it.
[220:28.86]We also had 300 bits from Gray the Color.
[220:32.09]Thank you, Gray.
[220:33.43]Okay.
[220:35.22]Great stream tonight.
[220:35.96]Would like to see more co-op with you and Joel.
[220:38.22]A lot of people recommended it, but will you be playing SWAT 4 anytime in the future?
[220:42.55]Also, do you ever finish that petition to get Burger Boy to permanently wear a bib?
[220:50.11]Permanently.
[220:50.86]Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[221:00.66]Yeah, there's so many games that I just want to play co-op or not.
[221:07.03]They just go in a line, and then you do one, and then one gets put behind you, you see it, you want to do it.
[221:13.53]I'll give you just a perfect example of this.
[221:18.98]The SWAT series.
[221:21.64]Me and Star were going to play SWAT.
[221:26.52]Like SWAT 3, SWAT 4.
[221:28.82]There's no online anymore.
[221:31.80]We were going to do this like five years ago.
[221:35.84]It was just too much of a pain in the ass.
[221:37.90]We've been talking about that for like fucking every year.
[221:41.47]Star and I are just like, oh yeah, we'll do it.
[221:44.55]It's always just a pain in the ass to do.
[221:47.33]But that was a conversation that we would have over almost a half decade.
[221:55.70]SWAT 4 multiplayer still works.
[221:57.63]You just have to get it from GOG.
[222:02.91]Is it for real?
[222:03.45]I always thought you had to get it in a server and make a server or something.
[222:16.14]Well, maybe I'll have to look into that.
[222:17.12]I'll have to look into that.
[222:20.06]He doesn't know.
[222:20.64]No, I don't know.
[222:28.78]It's super easy.
[222:29.98]Oh, alright, I'll figure it out.
[222:31.96]Alright, well.
[222:34.26]Add it to the list.
[222:35.03]After Beautiful Joe 1 and 2.
[222:36.67]So many games I want to play now.
[222:40.99]Ugh, too many games.
[222:46.05]But thank you, Gray the Color.
[222:47.05]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[222:49.12]Stefunky Chicken, thanks for the 400 bits.
[222:52.19]The best root beer is mug.
[222:53.35]That's a weird way to say A&W.
[222:55.15]Well, I didn't say it was the best.
[222:56.35]I just said it was really good.
[222:59.02]Did I say it was the best?
[223:02.96]I didn't say it was the best, did I?
[223:08.28]I did.
[223:09.40]Oh, well, I probably shouldn't have said that.
[223:10.96]I misspoke.
[223:12.50]I misspoke.
[223:13.86]It's okay.
[223:18.98]Ow.
[223:20.78]But thank you, Stapunky Chicken.
[223:23.31]Medi Marin, thanks for the 500 bits.
[223:26.09]Hey, Jerma.
[223:27.63]Yeah?
[223:28.71]Were you ever considering returning to games in the Monster Hunter series?
[223:32.11]The Switch has a couple games, and World recently got the Iceborne expansion.
[223:35.79]And was there any reason you never returned?
[223:38.65]Um... I just think that after a while, it just kind of... It's almost like streaming an MMO.
[223:44.83]In a way.
[223:45.53]You know the thing that you're going to do.
[223:47.11]You're going to go do the same thing.
[223:49.29]At least... We're going to kill this monster three or four times.
[223:54.22]I think I got most of what I wanted out of it on stream.
[223:58.58]Grind.
[223:59.32]Not necessarily the grind, but... When I turn on a stream, I'd rather do that off stream.
[224:10.14]Not that I don't think the game would be... I think it's boring.
[224:12.15]That's not the right word.
[224:13.91]But...
[224:17.29]It's... It just takes a long time to do stuff in Monster Hunter.
[224:24.10]There's a lot of setup.
[224:25.20]And then there's a lot... You know, you... Oh, you're just kind of going for that one weapon.
[224:49.57]I NEED THAT TOOTH!
[224:50.96]And it ends up going something like this.
[224:52.66]I NEED THAT CLAW!
[224:53.14]I NEED THAT TAIL!
[225:23.46]Sans?
[225:24.06]Hold on.
[225:27.22]I didn't know I could even do that.
[225:32.84]I need that claw!
[225:33.59]I didn't even know I could do that shit.
[225:35.87]Wow, that's kind of fun.
[225:54.40]I didn't know I could even do that.
[225:59.77]Now I'm quieter?
[226:02.93]There we go, there we go.
[226:06.17]But probably the answer is no.
[226:08.05]I don't have a reason to really stream it.
[226:11.13]Monster Hunter to me is more fun if I can just sit with my mouth open.
[226:15.79]And I need that tail for like four hours straight.
[226:21.44]Thank you though.
[226:22.56]Let's get the credits on screen!
[226:24.50]Credits. Credits. Credits. ...
[226:38.32]Here they come.
[226:39.94]Are they actually going to show up?
[226:40.80]I hope so.
[226:44.36]These are all the subs and all the bits.
[226:45.54]No, they're not all the subs.
[226:46.80]There's no bit credits.
[226:50.50]Play Mortal Kombat 11 on stream.
[226:52.30]Shaking my head.
[226:55.64]Why would I play Mortal Kombat 11?
[226:56.83]So I can get diarrhea-ed on by people that know how to play?
[227:06.69]Thank you for the subscription, guys.
[227:14.87]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[227:16.51]Thanks for subbing, all of you.
[227:22.57]Please do the Kylo Ren voice.
[227:24.34]I can't do the fucking Kylo Ren voice.
[227:26.98]No.
[227:27.98]I don't want to do it.
[227:41.75]That's the thing.
[227:45.57]Sometimes you have to do it.
[228:00.52]There.
[228:02.59]That's just Bugleberry with a megaphone on.
[228:10.78]That's a warehouse announcer voice?
[228:12.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[228:32.89]Hold on, I can do this.
[229:01.28]Check this out, ready?
[229:02.86]I... Hold on.
[229:05.24]I... I... I... Wait.
[229:15.84]I... Do you know?
[229:18.60]Oh, oh.
[229:19.80]Wait, why is it not working?
[229:20.80]Oh, it's not even on.
[229:23.62]I... Oh, it's so much fun to sing.
[229:30.61]This exists, too.
[229:36.67]Why would there be a button for this?
[229:38.38]Why would there be a... I'm sorry, guys, I'm so nervous.
[229:41.76]I didn't think I was gonna get... I didn't think I was gonna have to come up on stage and tell you guys anything, but... Seriously, I'm so excited for winning this award.
[229:53.12]And... Thank you, everybody.
[229:55.64]Thank you for all the support and everything.
[229:56.96]Thank you.
[229:57.34]Good night.
[230:02.71]Alright, I gotta go.
[230:05.54]I gotta go.
[230:09.92]I gotta get out of here.
[230:10.86]I gotta go.
[230:11.54]I gotta get out of here.
[230:12.38]I gotta go.
[230:12.84]I gotta get out of here.
[230:13.94]I gotta go.
[230:14.58]I gotta get out of here.
[230:16.50]We're gonna raid BoxBox tonight.
[230:19.75]BoxBox did a double raid over the last few days.
[230:26.63]I think there was a coordinated raid.
[230:28.97]It was two people.
[230:32.39]Oh, say hello to BoxBox.
[230:36.53]I missed a donation.
[230:37.41]What the fuck did he do?
[230:39.55]I did!
[230:39.95]I missed two!
[230:40.57]Thanks 300 bits for Wilcorn.
[230:42.15]Thank you, Wilcorn.
[230:43.83]Hey, Jeremy, this is my first donation to anyone.
[230:46.09]I've seen your streams for a while, and I've wanted to say thanks for the laughs and good feels.
[230:54.93]Thanks for even considering giving me money.
[230:59.06]Thanks for watching.
[230:59.80]Thanks for being here.
[231:02.61]And then finally, there was one more thousand bit donation from xwar2.
[231:07.75]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[231:12.86]Say, I feel like I'm really bad at Twitch messages.
[231:16.16]Nah, nah, you're good.
[231:18.18]I've been enjoying your VODs from Twitch.
[231:19.72]Randomly started watching you after the first Don't Talking or You'll Explode stream because of Twitter.
[231:26.11]I don't really watch Twitch, but I've really been enjoying your content.
[231:29.05]You're obviously an inspired and passionate guy, and I dig that.
[231:32.19]The bits are for conquering my childhood game Simpsons Hit and Run.
[231:36.32]I'll definitely be sticking around.
[231:38.24]Possibly any more Mountain Blade.
[231:40.68]If I were to go back to Mountain Blade, it would have to be with this shitload of VODs.
[231:43.42]Just like a total joke stream.
[231:49.11]But thanks.
[231:51.15]Best Simpsons Hit and Run is a wild experience.
[231:57.79]Play the new one.
[231:58.63]Yeah, Bannerlord's coming out.
[232:00.43]But hasn't Bannerlord been coming out for like four years?
[232:05.34]Is that actually going to come out?
[232:11.61]Sadly, it has.
[232:12.55]Hasn't it been in development for, like, five plus years?
[232:15.47]Or is it ten years, actually?
[232:16.67]Okay, it's been ten years.
[232:19.18]Now, but now it has a Steam page!
[232:20.68]Really?
[232:21.04]Okay.
[232:21.86]Now you got me interested.
[232:22.60]I mean, now I'm interested.
[232:31.88]Yeah, we're gonna go send some love to BoxBox.
[232:37.37]Got a lot of raids from BoxBox recently, like I said.
[232:41.06]Continues to show tons of love to this stream.
[232:46.70]Go say hello.
[232:49.20]See you guys on Sunday.
[232:50.44]Have a good couple nights.
[232:54.85]That was the wrong button.
[232:57.17]That was the right button.
[233:00.09]See you guys Sunday.
[233:02.21]Goodbye.
[233:03.88]That's right.
[233:06.07]I will not be participating in the raid.
[233:08.55]I'm going to go out to dinner.
[233:12.21]Give my best.
[233:40.01]you
[234:10.54]Thank you.
