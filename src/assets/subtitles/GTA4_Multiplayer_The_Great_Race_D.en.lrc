[00:02.67]We're going.
[00:05.53]Are we going?
[00:05.99]I'm not going.
[00:06.57]Not yet, not yet.
[00:07.15]Don't go yet.
[00:08.19]Well, this is awkward.
[00:10.79]Hey Stealth, we're not going yet.
[00:12.43]Hey.
[00:13.25]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:14.47]Wait a second.
[00:14.99]Let's get on the same field here.
[00:18.51]Oh, yeah.
[00:20.36]Jeremy, you picked the same color bike as me.
[00:22.30]I told you I was going bumblebee yellow.
[00:24.04]Look at this.
[00:25.48]Me and Boo Man.
[00:26.24]Look at those guys.
[00:28.67]I love how it says we've been sitting here for 30 seconds, which, yeah, we have.
[00:33.30]We're just getting ready here.
[00:34.88]Alright, are we ready to do this?
[00:38.98]Stealth, why are you, like, falling down?
[00:40.46]Oh, yeah, let's have, like, a biker hangout.
[00:48.20]Alright, I'll slow down until you guys catch up.
[00:56.39]That defeats the point of the race, though, I guess.
[00:58.23]Take that, BooMan!
[01:00.21]Catch up to me now!
[01:13.93]We started with motorcycles, and I'm legit in like an SUV right now.
[01:17.69]I'm trying to like come back.
[01:20.17]An SUV?
[01:21.71]Yeah, I'm in an SUV.
[01:23.29]I'm breaking the rules.
[01:27.33]I've lost you stealth.
[01:28.23]You're like way so far ahead.
[01:29.25]I'm not even trying to catch up now.
[01:33.31]I'm in fourth.
[01:34.62]It's alright.
[01:34.98]I'll be in first place in like two seconds.
[01:37.60]Stop up here.
[01:39.40]This moped sucks.
[01:42.73]It has, like, cheetah print on its seat.
[01:44.73]Nice.
[01:45.43]Oh!
[01:48.31]You devil.
[01:49.49]I'm going so fast right now.
[01:52.03]Why do we have mopeds?
[01:53.27]Oh my god!
[01:56.12]What just happened?
[01:59.38]Why is your car on fire?
[02:01.58]I'm gonna take you out.
[02:02.56]I'm taking you out, Boo.
[02:03.98]Boo, you're dead.
[02:05.52]Boo, I'm gonna kill you.
[02:06.96]Oh my god, you're on fire!
[02:08.78]You're on fire!
[02:11.34]Jesus!
[02:11.80]That didn't kill you?
[02:13.64]No, it knocked me off my bike, though.
[02:16.39]Oh, that was chaos.
[02:18.01]Hey, Jerma, get in with me.
[02:19.21]We can win together.
[02:20.69]Wait, we can?
[02:21.53]I don't know.
[02:22.03]Let's try.
[02:22.47]What a dumb moped.
[02:26.25]Lap one of two?
[02:29.49]Oh, yeah.
[02:31.39]Oh, no!
[02:35.01]No, come back!
[02:37.11]My car!
[02:40.18]Oh my gosh.
[02:44.81]I'm trying to be all nice and stuff.
[02:48.29]Alright, here we go.
[02:48.95]Here comes my epic comeback.
[02:53.44]I did.
[02:54.52]What did you just do?
[02:57.04]The biggest crash of my life.
[02:58.86]Did you try to blow me up, Boo?
[03:01.28]No.
[03:01.94]I was kind of looking behind me, looking at the explosion, and I happened to... The explosion that you caused?
[03:06.94]Did you cause it?
[03:08.71]No.
[03:09.53]I don't believe you.
[03:11.15]Ow!
[03:11.77]Here comes the ketchup!
[03:13.37]Here comes the ketchup!
[03:14.57]Boo!
[03:14.85]I'm gonna get fired!
[03:15.63]Why is everything exploding?
[03:17.97]A pedestrian just ran me over.
[03:23.18]And... did I make it back?
[03:26.36]I did.
[03:26.86]What just happened?
[03:34.05]What in the name of goodness?
[03:37.19]Oh wow.
[03:37.95]That was a well-timed explosive device.
[03:42.10]Jeremiah, you look like a hobo.
[03:43.96]I've suggested GTA VCS.
[03:46.30]Jeez.
[03:49.42]You broke every bone in my body right now.
[03:51.24]I'm pretty sure I just grinded to that rail like a pro skateboarder and just like came down and like tail slapped you with the back of my car.
[03:59.39]Here it comes.
[04:00.17]Wait for it.
[04:01.33]Wait for it.
[04:03.19]Wait for it.
[04:04.03]What?
[04:04.25]Nothing's gonna happen.
[04:09.63]Wait for it.
[04:23.64]There it is.
[04:25.66]Wow.
[04:26.16]There's some sulks across the road.
[04:27.66]Wow.
[04:31.44]Hey, bro.
[04:35.37]Oh, wow.
[04:37.19]Your car is like you just landed on top of a trash can on my screen.
[04:41.07]Yeah, I did.
[04:42.83]That was a big collision.
[04:46.89]Nice car you got there.
[04:47.57]Oh, thank you.
[04:51.33]I can see that look in your eye.
[04:53.25]I don't have an explosive yet.
[04:57.63]Yet.
[04:58.31]Keyword.
[04:59.93]Oh!
[05:01.35]Ow.
[05:01.77]Oh, this is the point.
[05:02.87]What was the point of that?
[05:05.40]I'm not quite sure.
[05:07.12]Can I break through the fence?
[05:12.71]I think I might have a problem here, possibly.
[05:15.31]A problem?
[05:17.17]Possibly.
[05:18.51]I'm sorry.
[05:18.83]Oh, I'm squashed.
[05:20.74]Help me out.
[05:21.44]Oh, thanks.
[05:21.92]I made it.
[05:22.42]Oh, thanks.
[05:23.00]Oh, yeah, that actually worked.
[05:24.24]Okay, cool.
[05:27.06]Let's go up the jump.
[05:31.02]Oh, such a jump.
[05:32.92]Oh yeah, clear that cop car.
[05:34.90]Oh, here we go!
[05:36.90]That was such a lame jump.
[05:42.60]You pretty much just, like, snailed over that.
[05:48.01]You guys look like petroleum jelly, like, getting, like, spread over that jump.
[05:51.43]Where are you?
[05:52.09]I'm currently fighting this lady to get her motorcycle.
[05:59.20]That's right, you run, lady.
[06:00.36]Things are so slow, nothing entertaining is going to happen from this.
[06:04.00]We're here though, okay?
[06:05.02]We traveled to the Statue of Liberty.
[06:13.93]What is this cop doing?
[06:17.04]This is possibly the most entertaining thing that could happen.
[06:19.54]Oh!
[06:19.92]You squeezed me!
[06:21.02]You squeezed me out!
[06:23.28]I got stuck!
[06:24.26]You're like, you're like, let me help you there, sir!
[06:27.68]Looks like you need a hand!
[06:31.02]I don't think I can get through there.
[06:32.74]I need like a push like you did.
[06:33.86]You need like a push.
[06:36.68]Oh.
[06:37.46]No.
[06:37.68]No dice.
[06:39.68]Wow.
[06:41.86]Jerm, are you on the dock?
[06:43.84]I am currently on the dock.
[06:45.93]You're going to kill this helicopter for sure, though.
[06:49.01]Oh, I just flipped the boat upside down!
[06:50.89]What just happened?
[06:51.65]Okay, I'm back up.
[06:53.21]I'm right side up.
[06:55.21]That was amazing.
[06:56.79]I'll just jump on the side.
[06:59.31]Oh, I spawned all the way over here.
[07:00.87]Alright, Boo, here's what I think.
[07:06.60]I think you should lift up just a little bit and climb and grab the legs.
[07:10.92]Alright, so do that.
[07:15.33]Up a little higher.
[07:15.93]I don't think you can do that.
[07:20.59]Higher.
[07:22.18]Higher?
[07:22.82]Okay, there.
[07:23.46]Like, right there.
[07:24.74]You'll never reach that.
[07:27.80]Oh!
[07:28.26]Yeah, see?
[07:29.06]Oh, wow.
[07:31.04]Oh, hit!
[07:31.64]Just go!
[07:32.08]No!
[07:32.32]Let's try that again.
[07:34.38]Wow, that was nice.
[07:35.66]I can't believe this.
[07:37.36]Try it again.
[07:38.14]A little higher.
[07:42.21]Oh, wow.
[07:42.83]Hold on.
[07:43.03]What am I doing?
[07:44.49]There he goes!
[07:46.57]There he goes!
[07:48.63]Oh, I thought that was gonna work for a second.
[07:51.15]Get outta here.
[07:51.81]I honestly thought that was gonna work for a second.
[07:58.06]What the?
[08:01.30]What's the matter?
[08:02.48]Oh, yeah!
[08:04.38]Wow.
[08:04.74]Wow.
[08:05.98]It's like I just headbutted you with a helicopter.
[08:09.14]Oh, you're gonna shoot at me?
[08:10.32]You're gonna shoot at me?
[08:12.65]Take your head off.
