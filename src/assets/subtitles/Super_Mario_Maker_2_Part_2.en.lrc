[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.92]Good afternoon.
[00:03.56]Welcome back.
[00:04.92]Today, we're going to be doing a few things.
[00:11.09]First of all, before we really get into that.
[00:15.25]Did you have a good sleep?
[00:17.71]I did.
[00:19.57]I said that really fast so you may not have caught that.
[00:21.55]I didn't.
[00:23.90]Remember how they had that headache last night?
[00:27.10]Well, it evolved into a migraine overnight.
[00:30.97]And I've taken a few Tylenol and I'm alright.
[00:33.03]I'm good.
[00:34.47]I just can't laugh that hard.
[00:36.78]Although, like, what a bad day to have a headache.
[00:40.88]Because that's not possible.
[00:42.52]I'm gonna have to... I wish there was a way I could put, like, a filter on my brain.
[00:50.71]I wish I could, like, take in a video file and, like, have it pre-screened and pre-rendered.
[00:56.45]And then, like, drip feed it into a part of my brain.
[01:02.59]Green screen movie night is tonight.
[01:05.80]So, like, I gotta be ready.
[01:07.48]So, I'm taking in some caffeine.
[01:09.52]I'll be fine.
[01:10.02]I took a couple times and all.
[01:11.22]I'm good to go.
[01:13.58]I wouldn't be here if I wasn't able to do it.
[01:15.74]So, don't worry.
[01:22.00]What is green screen encore night?
[01:24.30]Well, that's why we're gonna wait a little bit.
[01:27.44]I'm not gonna do it right away.
[01:29.88]There are about 50 plus videos.
[01:37.32]Some of them are like 10 seconds, some of them are like 3 minutes.
[01:42.28]There are a couple of exceptions from some community members that have given us some movies that are a little longer.
[01:52.98]The encore presentation will be about an hour and a half to two hours.
[02:01.23]No, it is not 50 JoJo videos.
[02:06.96]So, if you're not aware of what's going on... Back in... 4 or 5 months ago... That was a long time ago.
[02:18.21]We watched about 400 green screen videos.
[02:21.71]Since then, people have made some good shit.
[02:25.39]So obviously we want to show those, the high quality submissions.
[02:29.89]There are still some shit posts in here.
[02:32.29]But we had a system where we weren't going to show every single one.
[02:36.37]This playlist will be publiced so you can watch it whenever you want after this stream.
[02:42.25]And we will be doing this
[02:44.85]in like an hour because I don't want to just start right now and go because obviously I want as many people that will trickle in that want to be here to be here so after about an hour I expect most people that knew it was gonna happen for the last three weeks will want to be here.
[03:00.43]You know what I'm saying?
[03:05.55]Makes sense.
[03:08.49]Trickle.
[03:10.91]Make a playlist with every video that you skipped.
[03:13.32]That's probably gonna happen too.
[03:16.18]So there'll be just like a here's everything and then here's the stuff that was on stream.
[03:21.04]It should be fun.
[03:21.80]I'm looking forward to it.
[03:24.48]But before we do that... We've got some Super Mario to play.
[03:32.09]Super Mario Sunshine.
[03:33.79]I don't know why I just said that.
[03:38.01]This is Mario Maker.
[03:48.67]Let me warm up with a couple of levels and then from here we're gonna do the online stuff Okay, don't this is not gonna be another castle building stream.
[03:55.51]I promise Everyone's just like oh, no, no, no, what the fuck he's not gonna do like Mario Maker single-player Just story mode again.
[04:04.40]Well, I am but just for like five minutes.
[04:06.52]Oh
[04:09.57]So, I also have to check this too.
[04:11.09]One, two, three.

[04:15.00]Jump.
[04:15.62]Jump.
[04:15.94]We good?
[04:16.80]Good.
[04:21.20]In five hours?
[04:21.92]What if I just don't do the Encore Knight?
[04:27.18]I get so into this.
[04:29.65]We just don't ever do it.
[04:32.79]March of the Rookie Toads.
[04:34.17]This is another Peach level.
[04:35.95]Ten Toads!
[04:39.04]I wouldn't do that to you guys.
[04:42.54]It's obviously go all the way to the left.
[04:46.40]Oh shit, what's this?
[04:47.63]One, two, three?
[04:49.33]How do I get that?
[04:49.95]What's this?
[04:51.87]Can I, like, pull this up?
[04:57.69]I'm not gonna do that.
[05:06.70]Yank it?
[05:10.05]Can I... Wait, can I yank that thing?
[05:16.11]No, there's no indicator.
[05:16.97]I can't yank it.
[05:17.65]It has to be lit up.
[05:22.25]Let's get rid of the... I want to see what's down here.
[05:27.35]Reach the goal after defeating all Piranha Creepers.
[05:29.69]You got it.

[05:33.85]So somewhere around... I want to say maybe like 430? 430?
[05:38.38]5 Pacific?
[05:39.41]430 Pacific?
[05:41.01]Oh, I'm gonna know when it's been like an hour or two, because people are gonna be screaming in here.
[05:45.39]It's- Oh, Gordite!
[05:46.71]I just- I'm not supposed to yell it.
[05:47.83]I have a headache.
[05:49.61]What does this want me to do?
[05:55.54]Oh, shit.
[06:03.36]That's what it wanted me to do.
[06:04.18]Huh?
[06:05.24]Did it.
[06:14.09]First try.
[06:15.05]Yeah, that was fun.
[06:15.97]That was a good one.
[06:19.71]I think that's enough warming up.
[06:20.63]I think I know what I'm doing.
[06:29.72]I mean, if I can do that, I can definitely like have somebody honk a horn in my face and scream while I go through 18 different doors and have them open up and have like spikes underneath me.
[06:41.16]I think I can do that.
[06:43.30]This is new.
[06:44.98]Oh, I have this item now!
[06:45.86]I can do this!
[06:50.84]What the fuck is under here?

[16:58.66]Do I have to- Why do I have to see these?
[17:01.24]You know that it's not appropriate for Super Mario.
[17:03.98]Are these people chatting?
[17:06.51]Is this a chat room?
[17:18.79]Is this a bunch of ads?
[17:20.27]This is Billboard City.
[17:34.24]Alright, so now I go- how do I turn that one on?
[17:41.01]I did it.
[17:43.05]Stop saying Siri speedrun.
[17:45.03]Ow, my bum!
[17:50.21]It's very distracting.
[17:59.32]How do I make one of these?
[18:00.16]I'm just gonna put an advertisement for my channel.

[18:35.95]Cool idea.
[18:36.71]Wow, wow.
[18:38.49]I think this is intentional to have it just be irritating.
[18:43.51]Because it's very irritating.
[18:46.25]How do I do this?
[18:46.76]Do I have to jump from here to there?

[20:06.58]No.
[20:06.70]Alright, back to course.

[20:44.86]I will turn him off after this.
[20:46.20]I feel like it's part of the experience.
[21:01.25]Yeah, I will turn him off.
[21:03.45]See, that person died down there, and then I wrote, oof.
[21:13.10]Secret!
[21:16.06]Hey, thanks for the help, Dark Souls friend.
[21:23.69]Illusionary wall detected.
[21:31.09]Ooh, get that coin.
[21:32.61]What do the coins do in multiplayer?
[21:34.79]I mean, in, um... What do they do?
[21:37.96]Do you, like, buy currency or anything?
[21:39.38]No, you don't buy currency.
[21:40.40]Do you buy anything with this shit?
[21:48.36]Nothing.
[21:50.21]I don't get to build my own castle?
[21:51.89]Well, they dropped the ball on that one.
[21:53.71]They introduced that in single-player, and I don't have my own castle that I can build?
[22:07.49]Here comes a clown joke Oh shit, wait, what?
[22:19.95]Why does it drop them?
[22:26.25]Come on, give me another mushroom, quick!
[22:31.13]Holy shit, okay, I gotta be careful
[22:42.62]I did it!
[22:43.10]Hooray!
[22:47.38]It's not possible to lose.
[22:52.59]That's a pretty cool idea.
[22:53.49]Alright, now I'm gonna be Toad and I'm gonna turn off comments.
[23:04.42]I kinda feel like I'm running a YouTube channel.
[23:06.94]I'm gonna turn off comments, I'm gonna turn off engagements, I'm gonna make it so only one person can... Should I do that?
[23:18.54]Thanks for watching!
[23:51.65]Whoops.

[27:32.52]Did I win?
[27:42.38]Why does Toad have a fucking, like, beard belly?
[27:49.31]Big Mushroom Toad has a dad bod.
[27:59.57]Alright, what about 20 seconds?
[28:00.61]Switch, block, blast.
[28:01.73]People are really into the switch thing, huh?
[28:06.61]And then do infinite run.
[28:07.65]I will.
[28:09.73]I will.
[28:13.48]Ah, we got... No, that's not quite cake-toed.
[28:15.26]That's... close, though.
[28:29.61]Holy shit, that was kind of crazy.
[28:34.66]Oh!
[28:38.50]Oh, I missed!
[28:39.14]I missed that.
[28:39.80]That was right there, right at the end.
[29:00.44]Ooh, got them all.
[29:02.40]Oh!
[29:02.60]Got all the coins.
[29:18.66]What was mine?
[29:19.72]1907?
[29:19.74]Oh.
[29:24.53]Come on, what's that world record right there?
[29:28.63]Damn it.
[29:29.73]Oh well.
[29:31.77]Alright, that was a good one.
[29:38.48]You beat the world record.
[29:39.92]Oh, I could be up there as world record.
[30:16.01]What was that?
[30:21.27]How long was that?
[30:21.73]No, I got caught up on that first pole.
[30:25.59]I got caught up on the first pole.
[30:30.42]Oh!
[30:30.60]Do it again!
[30:31.36]I'll get it.
[30:31.74]I'm gonna get it.

[31:16.87]I'm gonna try it.
[31:28.05]Not quite.
[31:28.75]You gotta get clean over that first pillar.
[31:43.24]Three nanoseconds!
[31:48.73]You gotta go... later.
[31:55.77]I get it.
[32:00.37]There it is!
[32:13.70]OH!

[32:14.36]I think I fucked it up!
[32:15.06]No I didn't.
[32:17.38]I think I fucked it up.
[32:18.22]I think I fucked it up.
[32:22.77]I don't know.
[32:23.07]We'll see.
[32:23.33]I don't know.
[32:23.61]I think I fucked it up.
[32:32.34]Ugh!
[32:54.50]That was frame fucking perfect.
[32:55.88]You can't do it better than that.
[32:57.08]That was frame perfect.
[33:00.95]This is the one.
[33:26.01]Fucking come on!
[33:29.19]I can't believe it!
[33:32.68]I'll get it.

[33:47.71]Wait a minute.
[33:49.51]How do you gonna... Hold on.
[33:51.93]I'm gonna beat it by a shitload.
[33:55.76]I'm gonna beat it by a shitload.
[33:56.98]That thing's gonna hit the... Watch this.
[34:12.75]Dude, I have to do it.
[34:14.04]It's three nanoseconds.
[34:18.82]I have to be up there as Jeremy4567.
[34:20.24]I have to do this.
[34:39.46]I didn't even jump!
[34:40.70]What am I thinking?
[34:41.36]I'm the only person that's died here.
[34:58.61]Oh man.
[35:03.15]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[35:05.13]I have to do this.
[35:07.96]Movie Night is cancelled until I do this.
[35:10.68]I fucking lost it.
[35:19.78]I added that point.
[35:20.80]I'm going to see 0.000 in my dreams.
[35:48.12]No, no, I'm just gonna... You gotta jump earlier, I think, to get over that It's not gonna be it, you gotta go earlier Pretty good!
[36:58.21]Nope, nope, nope, not gonna be it It's the treadmill
[37:28.88]Oh, goddammit.
[37:54.24]Oh, come on!
[37:54.78]That's gonna be close!
[37:55.68]No, it's there!
[38:01.33]Mario has a bigger frame hitbox.
[38:06.59]Luigi has a bigger...
[38:29.82]It's that little bit right there.
[38:31.00]Luigi's faster on the treadmill.
[38:32.92]Are you serious?
[38:34.28]Is Toad just screwing me over here?
[38:35.94]Oh yeah.
[39:00.22]What did I just do?
[39:02.42]What was it?
[39:03.08]What was it for?
[39:03.90]What's the default?
[39:05.85]No.
[39:06.39]Nintendo!
[39:07.07]I wanna press B!
[39:37.48]I got to 0.3 nanoseconds, man!
[39:46.76]Pretty good!
[40:07.31]Oh my god, my god damn it.
[40:09.29]My god, what the fuck am I doing?
[40:12.54]I was trying to hit the very last frame of it so I'd fall on top of the axe.
[40:17.02]Pretty good!
[40:49.95]How did I get 316 before, man?
[41:26.75]No, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta... It's the treadmill, but I, how do I, how do I deal, how do I take care of that?
[41:34.87]Is it less jumps?
[41:36.40]One jump?
[41:36.84]Two jumps?
[41:37.30]Try to get it in one jump?
[41:38.72]But how?
[41:39.76]Lightly tap?
[41:40.66]Lightly press?
[41:59.19]fuck no time lost this is fast as you can walk forward no it's gonna be not even close
[42:30.00]You were 0.0003 seconds away from the world record.
[42:34.04]You can move on.
[42:34.72]Chat won't call you a loser.
[42:51.45]Well, I appreciate that.
[42:52.29]Thank you.
[42:53.15]That doesn't mean I'm not still hungry.
[43:02.32]The thing is, how do I get that to happen sooner?
[43:11.00]You got, you got, that's probably a way you can make him go forward faster, right?
[43:23.89]No, no, I gotta, I gotta, I know what I gotta do.
[43:26.12]Check this out.
[43:26.56]That wasn't running fast enough.
[43:44.77]This is the one.
[43:46.63]It's not the fucking one.
[43:50.36]Not the fucking one.
[43:51.12]It's over!
[43:51.50]I lost!
[44:14.08]No!
[44:15.44]I can feel it catching on me!
[44:18.51]Fucking come on, man.
[44:20.51]Please stop.
[44:21.37]I can't help it.
[44:21.85]Dude, you can't get to 0.0003 to the world record on this level and then not do it.
[44:56.86]Wait a minute.
[45:00.04]Can I get up there from not hitting the switch?
[45:04.05]I'm losing frames in the start.
[45:35.98]I hate it!
[45:48.93]There's no such thing as bunny hopping.
[46:07.92]Nope.
[46:15.08]I looked over and I just saw, what a loser.
[46:18.74]See?
[46:30.83]That was so close, but not enough!
[46:37.88]Short hop onto the shell?
[47:27.41]I'm never gonna do it The world record is frame perfectly time gated even if you were to
[47:38.36]What are you talking about?
[47:44.05]What does frame perfectly time gated mean?
[47:46.27]You can only match it not beat it
[48:10.34]What?
[48:12.54]Wait a minute I'm done
[48:42.24]This is the one right here.
[49:18.05]How do I get?
[49:47.62]Oh, whoops.
[49:48.50]Here.
[49:49.00]Sorry.
[50:11.51]It should be me up there!
[50:14.67]It should be me up there!
[50:16.15]One more time.
[50:52.23]I've done.
[51:07.93]I swear to god, I promise this is the final one.
[51:09.95]This is the last time I'm gonna do this.
[51:29.55]That's not very good.
[51:48.67]I have to get out.
[51:49.77]Just go.
[51:50.07]I don't care what this is.
[51:52.27]Toad's faster.
[51:53.07]No, he's not.
[52:05.17]I only know how to do one thing, and that's the... I don't know how to do anything else right now.
[52:10.84]I forgot how to play every other part of the game.
[52:19.26]Honestly, let me ask you, how do speedrunners like brush their teeth?
[52:22.28]You know what I mean?
[52:24.24]I did that for like an hour.
[52:25.17]I feel like if I did that for like six more days, I wouldn't remember how to fucking tie my shoes.
[52:39.21]My brain, like, hurts right now.
[52:40.63]Wait, did I just mess it up?
[52:49.56]Ooh, almost screwed that one up.
[53:10.90]I like this one.
[53:13.67]I'm hearing more than one sound.
[53:15.85]For an hour.
[53:22.33]Faster.
[53:22.81]No.
[53:23.54]No more faster.
[53:24.32]Oh, this is dangerous.
[53:27.10]Shit.
[53:38.01]You only played that level for 15 minutes?
[53:39.55]I feel like I've been here for like three days.
[53:40.75]The fuck?
[53:54.20]Hmm.
[53:54.88]Oh, puzzle!
[54:03.08]What an epic puzzle Oh, hearts Oh shit, I was looking up at the Oops
[54:34.44]One, two.
[54:36.74]Puzzle.
[54:44.45]Really?
[54:45.43]Don't... do it to me, please.
[54:53.17]What the fuck am I doing?
[54:54.29]Stop.
[54:54.99]Okay.
[54:59.71]That was cute.
[55:01.49]That was cute.
[55:11.79]Wait, what?
[55:16.04]Oh.
[55:17.92]Looking good.
[55:29.48]Movie Night died for this.
[55:30.96]Movie Night's still happening!
[55:42.01]When?
[55:43.62]In like 30, 40 minutes?
[55:45.62]In like an hour?
[55:46.62]I want to make sure that enough people are here to enjoy it.
[55:50.60]That's why I said I was going to do... I can do that.
[55:52.98]I'm kidding.
[55:59.77]This one's hard.
[56:02.79]Sun Touch Sanctuary.
[56:07.67]Puzzle Solving 1-1 Homecoming Hills.
[56:13.46]It's been an hour.
[56:14.45]It's been 57 minutes.
[56:45.62]It's just another version.
[56:52.21]Oh no, oh no.
[56:58.42]Let me just get to the end first, and let me see what it looks like.
[57:16.71]I ran out of time.
[57:17.39]He ran out of time on a speedrun.
[57:26.18]Shut up!
[57:47.34]GG.
[57:51.14]What'd I get?
[57:51.56]19,929.
[57:51.58]I can do it.
[58:20.68]Oh!
[58:21.44]I thought I could bait you.
[58:36.26]Only a couple more attempts.
[58:38.72]Let me finish it like one more or two more times.
[58:46.33]I got to get to the end, though.
[58:48.05]Last one.
[58:54.23]One where I get to the end.
[58:57.92]You bet $50 that I'm gonna get the world record?
[58:59.46]You think so?
[59:01.14]I'll take that bet.
[59:03.96]Who's got that bet?
[59:04.80]Anybody in here?
[59:08.14]Anybody betting?
[59:09.77]Anybody betting right now?
[59:13.03]Shit!
[59:13.25]That's what I have to do.
[59:19.11]I mean, I'm sorry guys, somebody's money, people's money is on the line.
[59:22.60]I have to make sure I try.
[59:23.94]Come on.
[59:57.65]I thought I did it.
[59:58.39]I thought I actually did it.
[59:59.33]One more try.
[59:59.87]I thought I was on the right for a second.
[60:22.21]That's as fucking clean as I'm gonna get it.
[60:24.55]Come on.
[60:45.66]20 seconds.
[60:46.14]Pow Block Blitz.
[60:48.42]Oh, I like this one.
[60:49.36]What's this one like?
[60:58.05]Speedrun.
[60:58.53]Short and sweet.
[61:02.19]Oh.
[61:10.94]Down $50.
[61:11.68]Oh shit, that's right, somebody- Oh, somebody gave- Speaking of $50, Phil.
[61:17.06]Phil gave $50.
[61:20.00]And I- Hold on.
[61:21.86]This is like an hour ago.
[61:27.42]Speaking of Phil.
[61:28.32]Uh, thank you so much for the 50 bucks, Phil.
[61:36.29]I failed 25.
[61:37.99]They say, hey drummer, long time watcher, first time cheer.
[61:39.87]It's been so fun lurking around your content ever since 2013.
[61:43.97]Just got my first paycheck at my first serious job.
[61:49.34]And I want to give back a little.
[61:50.54]Also, thanks for making me the one guy at last E3 streams credits those two weeks ago.
[61:56.76]Unfortunately, can't catch many streams from EU, so I rely on VODs.
[62:01.29]But it's still worth watching for the best entertainment out there.
[62:04.01]Much love and hope your life is going just as well.
[62:07.45]Thank you.
[62:08.73]Thank you, Phil.
[62:12.65]I do feel bad about... I have to pick that up.
[62:15.05]About EU times ever since moving to Pacific.
[62:20.59]But I'm at least glad that you can watch the VODs.
[62:23.74]And can enjoy them.
[62:25.58]If you... That's going to take too much time here.
[62:33.96]I'm not going to get stuck here.
[62:38.10]If you get world record on any of these speedrun levels, I will sub to you.
[62:44.54]It's a $5 bill.
[62:50.71]No, don't say that.
[62:59.73]Fast Switch Thinking.
[63:01.01]Let's do this one.
[63:01.69]This one looks cute.
[63:03.12]Okay.
[63:04.46]Only 3% completion rate on this one.
[63:15.39]We'll get a Cake Luigi.
[63:16.35]That's good.
[63:27.97]How do I... Why did I just do that?
[63:29.81]Oh, so if I get a world record on... If I get a world record on a stage, you'll sub to the channel.
[63:41.45]Like, at least three or four people said that, right?
[64:05.30]Okay.
[64:17.36]Fuck.
[64:19.74]I'm still- I have to beat it.
[64:30.49]I can't even get a world record here.
[64:31.89]Alright, I'm not even gonna... Just... they're sleeping.
[64:34.30]Just step on their heads.
[64:36.40]What's the point of that?
[64:37.16]It's a troll purpose.
[64:39.38]What is this for?
[64:42.40]I can take my fucking time.
[64:43.50]Who cares?
[64:43.92]Get in the car?
[65:00.81]World record!
[65:01.32]Why would I...
[65:33.18]I can't.
[65:42.13]So get out of the car and just go in the tube.
[66:03.74]No, go!
[66:04.28]I'm trying to just get away from this.
[66:20.26]World record.
[66:23.52]Let me see some fucking PogChamps in the chat.
[66:25.30]I think I got it!
[66:26.64]I think I got it!
[66:27.32]What?
[66:31.20]What are you talking about?
[66:34.76]What are you talking about?
[66:35.76]Get it!
[67:07.54]A million subs!
[67:08.52]A million subs!
[67:09.48]A million subs!
[67:14.65]Let me take a look.
[67:21.49]There it is.
[67:22.63]You set your first world record.
[67:26.63]I did it.
[67:27.05]These are all the people that betted against me.
[67:36.58]10 community subs from Lexi, and 5 community subs from Bakken.
[67:40.26]It has to be a speedrun level?
[67:42.40]Well, that wasn't part of the plan.
[67:45.91]I just said a million subs, and now it's happening.
[67:48.69]Thank you, Bebrahim, for the 20 community subs!
[67:52.57]20 from MGSFan!
[68:00.21]Thank you for the huge subs.
[68:02.65]But wait a minute.
[68:07.10]What about the one guy?
[68:12.23]Oh my god, a shitload are coming in.
[68:13.61]Fine, I'll do a speedrun course.
[68:18.75]Nocturne.
[68:20.23]Lexi, another 10.
[68:27.59]Nocturne.
[68:28.75]Thanks for the five community subs, Nocturne.
[68:35.00]Back in five more.
[68:36.18]Lexi, ten more.
[68:42.40]I lied because I didn't believe in you.
[68:45.60]Adventure MF Dan, thanks for the... Five community subs.
[68:50.13]Thank you, Adventure MF Dan.
[68:53.17]Avjo, five community subs.
[68:54.53]I gotta get another.
[68:55.09]I'm gonna just get world records of all the new levels.
[68:59.41]A.B.
[68:59.69]Joe, thank you.
[69:09.96]I think I can make it across if I just go quick.
[69:12.52]AnonymousGay5, thank you whoever you are.
[69:20.95]RarePepeBodyLotion, thanks for the five community subs.
[69:24.53]No.
[69:39.28]Fourth consecutive line, five community subs.
[69:43.78]Thank you so much.
[69:45.26]Nocturne, again, five community subs.
[69:47.15]The shitload just came in.
[69:48.15]I mean, I know that was like a joke, but like seriously, you guys don't have to do this.
[69:52.79]Thank you.
[70:02.87]This is a music level?
[70:05.10]How is it a music level?
[70:10.96]On.
[70:11.26]How do I turn it on?
[70:13.76]What's on?
[70:37.88]Thank you, Spyghetti, for the 10 community subs.
[70:40.56]FajitaMeat, thanks for 5 community subs.
[70:48.14]That's not world record pace.
[70:50.09]I can do better than that.
[71:07.15]I'm just going through and fucking just dumping on the world records.
[71:12.47]Because let's be honest.
[71:15.70]Who's actually going to play these more than once and care enough to do the world record?
[71:19.74]I got another world record.
[71:25.96]Oh my god.
[71:27.13]Vilemi just gave 75 dollars.
[71:31.30]Let's go play the, like, the actual other mode, because it's been an hour, and I want to do the endless challenge once.
[71:36.20]At least before we do the, uh... Five more subs from AB Joe.
[71:39.76]Thank you so much, AB Joe.
[71:40.74]Thank you, all you guys, for the subs.
[71:42.56]And, uh, $75 fucking dollars from, uh, Vilemi.
[71:45.96]Congratulations on the world record, Jerma.
[71:47.58]Why not celebrate by chugging down a not-at-all-disgusting Mountain Dew throwback?
[71:51.66]Don't think I've forgotten about your lies.
[71:54.37]Thank you for the $75, but I wouldn't drink a Mountain Dew throwback for $5,000.
[72:06.33]Thank you so much for the 75 bucks.
[72:08.75]Super expert.
[72:09.77]This is a bad idea.
[72:15.37]But thank you so much, Vilemi, for the 75 bucks.
[72:20.34]Thank you for the 50 dollars from Timmy.
[72:24.38]They just say, oh, like the oh no face.
[72:27.96]Oh.
[72:28.92]No, it's like an oh face.
[72:29.68]Why do I have 30 lives?
[72:37.08]Speedrun.
[72:44.23]What?
[72:44.43]I have to go backwards and then down.
[72:49.29]But thank you so much for the 50 bucks, Timmy and Vilemi.
[72:51.79]And everybody that's dumping huge amounts of sub.
[72:56.73]You guys are too much.
[73:04.16]Oh, fuck.
[73:06.44]What?
[73:12.90]I gotta do the spin move.
[73:18.44]Why does this- No, no, no, this is not- I only have 28 lives.
[73:25.93]You need to spin.
[73:27.43]Spin, spin, spin.
[73:29.21]No, I got it.
[73:29.81]I can do this, Nintendo.
[73:30.67]Leave me alone.
[73:31.15]Don't Luigi me.
[73:32.71]I'm already playing as Luigi.
[73:33.81]Don't you get it?
[73:41.14]Oh, fuuuck.
[73:52.73]One, two, three, four.
[74:01.22]Shut the fuck up and beat the level, Jeremy!
[74:15.07]I can go faster than that too.
[74:16.95]You wanna hear like some crazy shit?
[74:18.41]I can do it.
[74:19.67]But I can't, my brain is so small that I can only do one thing at a time.
[74:28.98]Oh, what the fuck do I go?
[74:31.26]What the fuck, where do I go?
[74:32.38]I don't know where to go.
[74:35.16]What, what's on?
[74:36.72]Backwards?
[74:38.02]Up, forward?
[74:50.02]Where was I going?
[74:50.94]Go back and then to the left?
[75:00.94]Where do I end up?
[75:04.39]Oh, who cares?
[75:05.15]I just hurt myself.
[75:11.29]I just went to go drink my drink and the straw just poked me in the back of the mouth.
[75:19.93]Because I leaned... I leaned... What?
[75:44.60]I like this one, though.
[75:45.30]This one's well thought out.
[75:46.88]I'll get this.
[75:49.08]And by the way, stay tuned for the green screen encore movie night.
[75:52.62]Happening soon.
[75:56.02]Just like every fucking event you've ever seen.
[75:58.52]Especially on this platform.
[76:00.74]It's gonna be like six hours delayed.
[76:03.08]No.
[76:04.18]No, don't worry.
[76:06.78]I have no idea what the hell to do after that.
[76:22.00]Explain to me.
[76:22.56]I have to go back up that way.
[76:33.36]20 Omega LOL lives.
[76:38.65]Whatever.
[76:43.57]I swear to God.
[76:45.13]Super expert.
[76:46.53]I'm fine.
[76:47.37]I'm fine.
[77:08.52]You gotta just... I know what I have to do now.
[77:11.41]You just hold left.
[77:12.71]You don't have to worry, but you're gonna put that hat on.
[77:15.17]It's automatic.
[77:15.87]This is not disqualified.
[77:38.44]Jerma turns his face cam on and reveals he was dressed as Luigi this whole time Even if I was who cares
[77:58.26]Why would that even matter?
[78:09.27]Hey guys, I have overalls today!
[78:18.96]Oh shit!
[78:19.84]Now what?
[78:22.90]What the?!
[78:24.40]Okay, uh...
[78:34.40]I got freaked out when the thing came off my head.
[78:36.60]I got hit by something, and he went... Here we go.
[78:54.94]Up.
[79:00.34]Oh, you... Punk.
[79:14.55]You rotten kid.
[79:16.92]You punk.
[79:17.78]I don't care if I lose.
[79:22.72]I did it.
[79:23.00]I don't know.
[79:23.50]What the fuck was that?
[79:25.72]I swear to God, my brain was on slow motion.
[79:28.95]I got freaked out.
[79:29.91]I died, but I didn't die.
[79:31.09]I don't know.
[79:43.56]Come on, Super Luigi!
[79:45.25]Come on, everybody loves Luigi!
[79:57.58]Did I really not make that jump?
[80:03.04]That's unbelievable
[80:06.85]What was wrong there?
[80:07.51]Was it not?
[80:08.71]Whatever.
[80:10.65]I'll get through this.
[80:12.05]It's not 100 Lives Mario anymore.
[80:15.91]You just have to beat it.
[80:18.79]I'm panicking.
[80:19.93]Slow down.
[80:20.47]Who cares if you don't get the world record?
[80:29.55]Yeah, it's not going to look good in a YouTube video, but I'll still get there.
[80:36.45]What the fuck is happening?
[80:38.17]If I didn't get, like, baited into jumping into those coins...
[80:57.13]Okay, so what?
[80:57.95]Am I understanding that... So I'm fine.
[81:01.45]Go back.
[81:02.39]So if you don't do the swimmy arms, then that... What is you doing?
[81:08.02]Hold on, what is this?
[81:08.96]Hey, thank you for the five, computer.
[81:23.31]Never trust nanners.
[81:26.70]Thank you.
[81:40.51]I swear to God, I pressed the button.
[81:42.45]I did.
[81:42.75]I pressed it.
[81:43.91]I pressed it.
[81:45.45]I pressed it and it... God.
[81:53.05]I'm tilted now.
[82:11.90]Excuse me, what happened there?
[82:20.67]What happened?
[82:22.87]Why did I overshoot that?
[82:24.07]I did that every time the same way.
[82:26.55]Something must be wrong with the game.
[82:30.35]Actually, no, I heard about that.
[82:31.25]I heard about Nintendo was patching some of the control issues.
[82:36.37]Yeah, I saw an article on Kotaku about the control issues or something.
[82:43.47]I almost just fucking let go of the controller.
[82:56.93]Yeah, Nintendo was, like, saying at the moment, like, a press release came up from Nintendo saying, like, we're sorry about the control problems.
[83:03.61]We just, like, didn't test them.
[83:05.90]And, like, we're just really sorry about it.
[83:08.20]But it'll be fixed.
[83:10.70]So, like, when you guys buy this game and you guys, like, get this game later, like, you're gonna have, like, a different game than me.
[83:18.42]So that's why, like, I'm not doing so good, but you'll, like, do better than me.
[83:20.82]Because, like, the patches will be there by then.
[83:33.79]Essentially, what I have to do is I'm, I'm hold, I have to queue up controls.
[83:36.95]There's, like, four or five seconds of input lag.
[84:06.29]Alright, come on.
[84:07.92]I gotta jump like at the very last second up here.
[84:14.02]What is the problem here?
[84:16.12]I'm... How am I not making this?
[84:23.67]That was as far to the end as I possibly could.
[84:28.51]What's happening?
[84:42.80]Good thing I had 30 lives.
[84:48.24]I did it!
[84:48.54]Okay, hold on.
[84:50.05]Wait, just... I'm not going fast enough!
[84:52.63]What the fuck is happening to my brain?
[85:08.95]I just... I had to... I put the car in reverse.
[85:14.01]Oh my god.
[85:14.61]Oh my god.
[85:15.67]You just have to keep moving, and I didn't.
[85:28.56]I put the car in reverse.
[85:29.52]You can never put the car in reverse in a speedrun level.
[85:34.58]Ever.
[85:41.61]Here we go.
[85:50.01]Now what?
[85:51.09]What?
[85:52.23]Now what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[85:54.69]Um, um, does he kill him?
[85:59.07]Back again?
[86:00.53]What?
[86:03.13]Do you have to go back and then jump over the coins and then go back down?
[86:11.75]Oh shit.
[86:13.41]I'm gonna lose.
[86:13.89]This is it.
[86:15.13]This is the last chance.
[86:32.94]Oh my god, what the fuck did I do?
[86:34.32]Oh my god!
[86:36.48]I just... I didn't mean to press that button.
[86:41.08]Like, sir, I just, I just, like, bah.
[86:45.90]Do it again.
[86:46.44]Fucking, whatever.
[86:47.06]Oh my god, I'm so upset right now.
[86:50.28]I was pressing too hard on Y, therefore every button on the controller is pressed.
[86:56.42]Oh god damn it, give me a break.
[87:07.03]I'm so fucking mad right now, I had that too.
[87:11.34]I need to get like a pro controller, not like the fucking side cheese it controller.
[87:15.86]Alright, I'm gonna... I gotta breathe for a second here.
[87:33.02]Why am I using like the mini hot dog bun controllers?
[87:49.81]What the hell?
[87:51.92]What?
[88:23.18]I'm so on tilt right now.
[88:24.86]Like, you didn't just shake the pin vault machine, you took a hammer and just wound up and smashed into the middle of the glass and just started stealing components.
[88:49.97]There's really a fucking troll block right there too.
[89:01.50]Here comes the explosion The spin doesn't work Do I have to be big?
[89:32.89]Oh, that stupid block.
[89:34.05]I'm not gonna help with this.
[89:37.49]I'm not gonna help with this.
[89:50.74]Alright, I got a mushroom.
[90:03.42]I fucking forgot again.

[91:03.81]There's gotta be a reason for that.
[91:11.99]Now watch out for this dickhead that flies from here.
[91:16.90]Okay.
[91:28.60]That should just go immediately.
[91:29.86]What am I waiting for?
