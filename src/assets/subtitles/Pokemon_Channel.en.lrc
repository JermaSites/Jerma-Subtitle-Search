[02:14.87]The time is 5-59.
[02:16.09]How does it know that?
[02:19.73]It's like kind of accurate.
[02:21.29]This is an original Wii.
[02:22.80]Why would its date be correct?
[02:23.88]5-54.
[02:26.70]No, no, no.
[02:27.72]It's... No, that's not correct.

[02:40.74]Who cares?
[02:41.10]It's an hour ago.
[02:48.96]Whatever.
[02:49.32]So do you really just watch TV with Pokemons?
[03:03.11]Fucking goddamn green ball.
[03:04.81]Relax.
[03:18.03]I'm like, I'm like, Licklipper.
[03:20.09]There we are.
[03:21.05]I have to fly this ship.
[03:26.71]This is pre-recorded?
[03:34.89]How?
[03:35.19]Okay, here we go.
[03:42.68]Oh, the TV seems to have arrived.
[03:43.74]Welcome to Pokémon Channel.
[03:46.50]This TV is a gift to you from Pokémon Channel.
[03:49.06]Pokémon Channel is a TV station that airs many kinds of Pokémon programs.
[03:54.08]You've been chosen as our first test audience, but first things first, may I have your name?
[03:58.58]Signing up is easy.
[03:59.32]Just register your name.
[04:00.18]That will start putting programs on the air.
[04:03.14]May I have your name?
[04:03.84]Let me confirm your name is Seth.
[04:14.55]A.K.A.
[04:15.67]person who owned this console before I did.
[04:18.55]Because it's pre-owned.
[04:21.66]Hey Seth, let's uh... The first program is brand new anime.
[04:29.00]Kichou Brothers.
[04:32.42]I'd like you to watch the TV anime all the way through.
[04:34.81]Okay, we gotta give our real honest opinions too.
[04:39.01]Here we go.
[04:42.59]That's a shitty font.
[04:48.48]That's like a default Adobe Premiere font.
[04:56.16]What if I press A?
[05:02.76]If I press, if I just skip it, what happens?
[05:07.79]I've waited a long time for this, guys.
[05:10.38]And in just 24 hours from now, Meowth's dream is finally gonna come true!
[05:15.56]They're the Pichu brothers, but I'm sure you knew that.
[05:24.18]Cause these two, I know them both far and wide.
[05:29.53]Just try and guess the next place they'll turn up at.
[05:35.11]You see, life's a blast with your best friend by your side.
[05:38.97]I wouldn't watch this.
[05:42.06]Where's my, like, America's Got Talent, like, button?
[05:46.80]An amusement park where everybody gets in free.
[05:53.00]They never know just what's in store for them each day.
[05:57.41]What?
[05:58.59]It's cute, but I wouldn't watch it.
[06:00.27]Good times are guaranteed.
[06:04.21]Pichu, Pichu, that's them there.
[06:07.09]Pichu, Pichu, fun's their game.
[06:09.95]Of course, there are days things don't go right.
[06:12.81]Even the best of buddies sometimes fight.
[06:15.06]This is free on YouTube.
[06:16.00]What?
[06:16.10]That's when they turn the whole world upside down.
[06:22.45]Is this the intro?
[06:27.13]Aww.
[06:28.77]I mean, that's not funny.
[06:29.89]That's not cute.
[06:30.81]He's got like a broken neck.
[06:32.25]That's not really cute.
[06:33.49]What's wrong with you guys?
[06:43.99]You won't see one without the other These perfect pals stick brother to brother Side by side it's Pichu and Pichu Oh yeah Side by side it's Pichu and Pichu Well it seems like the Pichu brothers and their friends are ready for another day of fun at Pokémon Clubhouse I fucked it up
[07:14.71]Alright, I'm ruining the show.
[07:16.59]Alright, alright, alright, no more, no more.
[07:41.53]This sounds very interesting.
[07:43.55]So the other Pokémon want to see for themselves.
[07:45.76]Get this away from me.
[07:53.68]Do I just watch this?
[07:55.44]You actually just watch this?
[07:57.12]Is this what we do?
[07:57.64]Is this what the game is?
[07:58.32]Oh, nice.
[08:12.85]Is this a whole, like, 22 minute episode?
[08:23.81]It's 22 minutes.
[08:26.08]This is a real mystery, so the gang heads for the park to figure out what the crest- No, it's not 22 minutes long.
[08:33.84]There's an A-Palm and a Smeargle.
[08:35.90]Maybe they can give the gang some answers.
[08:40.08]Alright, not all of you say your fucking name all at once at the same time.
[08:50.45]That'd be so annoying.
[08:52.67]If you get more than like ten Pokémon in the same room at the same fucking time, holy shit that would be obnoxious.
[08:58.82]Now I know why like you only have like three.
[09:01.62]Rounded.
[09:03.34]I got like a fucking crowd of- of Pokemons.
[09:05.48]Who's gonna be yelling the names?
[09:06.98]It's chaos.
[09:11.58]Strawberry.
[09:20.79]Wrong.
[09:21.17]Strawberry.
[09:21.63]Berry.
[09:25.41]Am I gonna get in trouble for doing this?
[09:28.31]Is this gonna give me like my channel flag?
[09:36.57]I mean, it's this video game.
[09:40.19]It's this game.
[09:41.49]It's a game I put in my Wii.
[09:44.60]Well, I think that's it.
[09:45.18]To be continued, okay.
[09:49.36]Is it going to ask me what I thought?
[09:52.92]This is just like Nielsen ratings Pokémon.
[09:56.55]Alright, let's see.
[10:07.01]But what did you think of the anime?
[10:08.79]How about I get you to file a report right now?
[10:11.51]I need you to send your reports through the report channel.
[10:14.33]You can change the channels by pressing either minus or plus on the TV using the A. Oh, I was going to say, this is not the right controller.
[10:27.16]You can also change channels using the controller.
[10:29.02]Just press either L or R. The TV can be turned on and off by pressing on using the, yeah, pressing Z on the controller.
[10:36.15]Okay.
[10:39.27]Is this a TV or is this like a fucking microwave?
[10:42.68]It's three buttons.
[10:44.72]Okay, set the channel to the report channel.
[10:49.46]Report channel.
[10:53.18]I talk through the TV.
[10:56.08]Set the hand on the report on the screen and press A. Alright, let's report.
[11:02.81]Hi, your report has safely arrived.
[11:04.03]Fine, I'll save your report data.
[11:05.31]I didn't even get my report.
[11:08.33]Oh, it's how to save the game.
[11:12.14]Right.
[11:14.36]Right.
[11:20.04]No, don't even make that joke.
[11:23.58]I want you to have this as a thanks for your report.
[11:25.40]$20?
[11:26.66]What do I do with the money?
[11:30.15]If you save up some P, you'll be able to shop for all sorts of things on the shopping channel.
[11:34.17]Quiz channels give you chances to earn P. Before you finish the game, remember that you must make a report.
[11:42.82]Oh, what was that cry?
[11:43.76]How about backing away from the TV and taking a look around?
[11:47.28]Whoops, before you do, you should turn off the TV.
[11:49.86]Press on using the hand and M with E. How's he still talking to me?
[12:02.09]Good, you turned off the TV.
[12:03.79]It's like, you're fucking in the room with me too, dude?
[12:07.18]Step away from the TV, move.
[12:09.24]Where's B?
[12:14.46]You can take a look around the room by, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:16.68]Perhaps there's something here.
[12:27.07]Where's the telephone to call police?
[12:34.27]No, no, no, excuse me.
[12:35.63]I know I might have like an 80-inch TV and a gigantic bay window, but this is not like park your car in front of my fucking driveway and watch like Sharknado with me, okay?
[12:58.78]So why'd they run?
[13:01.01]he's gonna talk over each movie right?
[13:03.08]Pikachu's like

[13:34.42]Like, hey!
[13:35.46]No, no, no.
[13:35.90]You're not old enough for that.
[13:36.86]Oh, I want to do it so bad everyone hates it.
[13:55.45]I want to do it wicked loud, as loud as I fucking can.
[14:00.20]Alright, let's go!
[14:06.18]Oh, it's going to happen.
[14:07.72]I can't guarantee it won't happen.
[14:09.08]You understand how to use the TV?
[14:10.28]There's something I should tell you.
[14:11.62]If I had a Pokepad, along with your TV, the Pokepad would let you access a variety of information.
[14:32.23]Turn on the Pokepad by pressing start.
[14:33.70]Here, try it out now.

[41:49.94]There's a character that looks like that.
[41:52.16]It wasn't Lucario is what he looks like.
[41:55.30]He's got the same scheme as the wrestler Pokémon.
[42:00.87]Incineroar.

[42:25.94]Silhouette place.

[42:28.10]Do I have to like put my face up to it?
[42:29.58]How do we, how do we do this?
[42:30.34]I don't, I don't, I don't play Pokémon.
[42:33.41]I don't know what that is.
[42:38.47]Just like, get out of the way.
[42:45.95]That's not right.
[42:46.53]Oh, it is right.
[42:52.60]Correct.
[42:55.28]Charmander is in the lead.
[42:56.54]I'm sorry.
[42:59.84]No, never mind.
[43:02.04]Is this a Pokémon?
[43:09.85]This looks like a piece of chocolate.
[43:20.53]He's fucking angry.
[43:25.76]Oh, it's underneath it.
[43:26.96]I thought that was like a hoof.
[43:29.10]Or like a bottom.
[43:36.04]Peek-a-boo quiz.
[43:37.04]How do we even answer these correctly?
[43:41.46]Oh, so I see it now.
[43:46.82]It's that thing.
[43:47.66]It's the one we just saw, right?
[43:53.77]It's Blaziken.
[43:55.81]How do we... How do I go on this show?
[44:05.44]That's the one from Smash Brothers.
[44:07.52]Oh.
[44:08.26]No song.
[44:09.39]Liar.
[44:12.43]There's no winner.
[44:13.63]But I want to get on this show.
[44:18.87]Maybe I can get...
[44:33.20]50 bucks?
[44:33.68]Are you fucking kidding me?
[44:36.81]We did it.
[44:47.74]Okay, now it's time for no more TV.
[44:50.68]That we watched every show.
[44:54.76]Pikachu, we watched every show that we have.
[44:56.94]And, sadly enough, we only have, uh, seven full television shows available to us.
[45:05.23]It wants to watch Anime Part 1!
[45:07.45]I don't wanna watch Anime Part 1.
[45:27.33]We already saw this.
[45:37.72]I'm dumb going.
[45:39.66]You really are like a fucking five-year-old.
[45:41.68]You guys don't know.
[45:43.96]Kids love watching the same episode they've seen of a TV show a thousand times.
[45:48.63]Like, if you DVR the same episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, little kids will want to watch the same one every fucking day.
[45:57.18]So this does not surprise me at all.
[45:59.46]And eventually it gets to the point where you can say every line of the whole show.
[46:04.41]For instance, the episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse where Goofy doesn't know how to bake a cake.
[46:10.75]I know every line.
[46:13.05]I could recite the whole thing.
[46:14.92]I don't wanna watch this.
[46:15.80]We don't have to watch the whole thing though.
[46:18.10]He's sad about this.
[46:18.92]Alright, that was fun.
[46:48.81]He's gonna want to watch this every day.
[46:50.25]This is just babysitting.
[46:51.55]Well, let me make it more accurate.
[47:29.47]Bros like these can't stay mad for long In no time they're back where they belong Side by side it's Pichu and Pichu You won't see one without the other These perfect pals stick brother to brother Side by side it's Pichu and Pichu Side by side it's Pichu and Pichu
[48:01.60]Well, it seems like the Pichu brothers and their friends are ready for another day of fun at their Pokémon Clubhouse.
[48:09.00]Uh-oh.
[48:12.10]Sounds like Smoochum's got a problem.
[48:18.40]Smoochum's all excited.
[48:19.66]Pokémon are carrying little cards and they're shaped like a crescent moon.
[48:38.26]This sounds very interesting.
[48:40.28]So the other Pokémon want to see for themselves.
[48:42.50]Smooch them, smooch them, smooch them, smooch them.
[49:02.62]Let's go.
[49:23.31]No, no, no, no, no, I can't, I can't.
[49:26.87]Honey, honey, honey, don't put that in your mouth!
[49:29.43]Don't put that in your mouth!
[49:30.49]Oh my god.
[49:30.99]I ordered, I only ordered five of them.
[49:33.25]I ordered five.
[49:33.97]Well, you're just gonna have to return them.
[49:37.46]You're gonna have to return them.
[49:40.26]I don't want them.
[49:50.62]No, that's not what I, that's not what I'm talking about.
[49:54.40]Okay?
[49:54.74]Get off of that.
[49:55.94]Get down from there.
[49:56.74]Don't climb that.
[49:58.52]Don't climb that.
[50:00.24]Get down.
[50:02.60]Just please.
[50:03.60]Thank you.
[50:05.70]Anyways.
[50:07.54]Sorry.
[50:13.34]It's hell here, okay?
[50:17.66]What's that?
[50:19.90]Just turn the volume down.
[50:20.98]Turn the volume down.
[50:21.60]I gotta go.
[50:23.36]I'll tell ya.
[50:31.32]Swearing.
[50:32.38]I just spit everywhere.
[50:40.22]I've been around.
[50:41.71]My sister had kids and I know people that have kids.
[50:46.01]That's tricky.
[50:46.87]That's tricky.
[50:47.41]It's a lot of work.
[50:49.47]Shout out to all the fuckin' moms and dads out there.
[50:56.29]Oh, but we gotta get you off fuckin' TV.
[51:03.49]I had the mic muted when I first came in.
[51:06.44]Alright, no more news!
[51:12.06]It wants to watch PNF.
[51:14.94]What's PNF?
[51:20.71]Wait, we're already watching PNF?
[51:29.74]No, no, no, no more.
[51:32.34]No more of that.
[51:33.38]Here, okay.
[51:34.74]It's Phineas and Ferb?
[51:46.69]We just watched this whole thing!
[51:49.74]No, you know what?
[51:56.01]We're done.
[51:59.39]Yes, I have.
[52:01.25]That's very odd, that isn't what it says in your reports.
[52:12.01]I mean, if you do sign up to be one of those people that has, that you get like all these fucking devices that are in your house, listen to this.
[52:20.98]For those of you that don't know, if you sign up to do one of these watch TV and report back things, they literally make you wear a device in your house.
[52:33.51]Like, like an ankle bracelet if you were on like house arrest.
[52:38.58]And it fucking keeps you on there.
[52:40.80]And it tracks everything that you ever do.
[52:46.86]It's like, we want to be able to catch what network you're on at any second.
[52:50.74]And you have to wear it.
[52:51.49]You have to have it on at all times.
[52:56.57]How do I know this?
[52:58.37]Because... Funny story about that.
[53:04.61]A long time ago, my family decided maybe we would try this.
[53:09.59]It sounds interesting.
[53:11.03]And once we found out what we had to do, and we found out we were going to have to wear these weird fucking devices, it was like, I don't think we want to do this anymore.
[53:21.11]It's a sitcom.
[53:34.53]Yeah, it was weird.
[53:37.10]But they would- they were gonna pay you though.
[53:39.28]That's the thing, I think they like paid you.
[53:41.30]This is like 17 years ago, 18 years ago.
[53:44.76]I think they would pay you.
[53:47.59]If you like, actually did all the weird shit.
[53:52.59]Anyways, uh, we gotta watch the news all the way through.
[54:00.00]Jeremy, you're the reason why Community got canceled.
[54:10.41]portable people like you thought I was lying no I'm not lying they have these like weird ankle trackers you like have to wear it on your leg it's like a walkie talkie that you connect it's real I see and there you have it that ends my report from the scene
[54:35.34]Wait, wait, no, my whole family wasn't on probation.
[54:39.23]This is not me, like... Yes, I could have been lied to as a fucking 11-year-old.
[54:46.47]Oh, we all have to wear fucking these bracelets, son.
[54:49.49]It's the TV companies that are tracking what we're watching.
[54:52.12]And, like, my whole family's on house arrest?
[54:54.58]It was like, what, like, that's, no.
[54:57.38]I mean, that's not what happened.
[54:58.90]This is a real thing.
[55:02.62]Alright, we've, Pikachu, we've watched it all.
[55:09.10]Report it.
[55:12.40]It's me, hey, it's me, Oak.
[55:14.02]That's kind of weird.
[55:17.00]Thanks for your report.
[55:17.78]Hmm, Pikachu watches TV this way.
[55:20.72]This is a very informative report, fine.
[55:22.38]As thanks for your report, I'll give you something, some cards?
[55:39.85]Okay.
[55:41.43]Uh, can I do, like, a special, like, delivery instructions?
[55:45.45]And, like, that little check, the text box?
[55:47.77]Uh, I don't want that fucking thing in my house.
[55:50.80]Just leave it at the door.
[55:54.86]I got Shmeargle 2.
[55:59.22]Using Shmeargle 2, you'll be able to paint images taken off TV.
[56:05.03]Your artwork will be automatically submitted for use on Pokémon Channel.
[56:11.85]Just one drawback.
[56:13.32]Shmirigul 2 can only be used with the anime Pichu Brothers.
[56:22.14]While Pichu Brothers is showing on TV, set the thing on Shmirigul 2 and then press A. Now I must admit something.
[56:33.55]Shmirigul 2 has only just been completed.
[56:35.91]Nobody has tested it properly yet.
[56:37.91]Can we get you to test it out, paint with it, and file a report on it?
[56:40.59]We're counting on you.
[56:52.70]A weapon to surpass Metal Gear.
[56:58.19]Alright, we gotta put on the P-True Brothers.
[57:01.50]Okay, part one.

[68:02.10]Now we don't.

[70:28.89]Its wings, its feet, its mouth.
[70:31.87]Its mouth.

[72:33.97]Wait, Pikachu's not like four, three or four feet tall?
[72:39.52]Wait, he's like this big?
[72:42.84]No he's not!

[72:48.02]He's like fuckin' huge!
[72:52.40]No, I know, I might be- I might be confusing, like, the Pikachu in the costume at, like, the birthday party that's, like, six feet tall.
[72:59.51]Like, the big- um, no, I'm to- but is he actually- he's not that big.

[73:25.42]He planted a flower.
[73:26.57]Awwwww.

[73:32.15]Pikachu planted the flower seed for me.
[73:34.49]Aww, what?
[73:37.87]Pikachu picked up the Wailmer pail.
[73:39.72]Pikachu's watering the garden.
[73:46.30]Wow.
[73:49.90]Oh, that's so cute.
[73:53.36]Wonder what will grow.

[92:06.11]And it's time to do some exploring.
[92:18.74]When did the TV get fixed?
[92:19.70]When I skipped on my Wii of folding.
[92:34.07]This is like an actual TV show.
[92:35.35]Was this actually on the air?
[92:36.77]She's tired.

[93:04.44]The Pichu brothers are explaining that APOM sent them.
[93:17.64]So that's it.
[93:18.99]The Crescent Game of Thrones are invitations to Meowth's party.
[93:23.75]And that fruit's reserved for invited guests only.
[93:29.82]Teddy, you're so teddy.
[93:31.02]Squirtle, squirtle, squirtle.
[93:57.36]Imagine voice acting one of these abominations.
[93:59.56]Well, besides him, it'd be pretty great.
[94:04.02]Because you just have to go like this.
[94:09.57]And then they use that for the next 12 years.
[94:14.17]No invitation, no party.
[94:20.54]Look, there's hope.
[94:26.05]You just have to give different emotions of, of what, huh, Fett?
[94:30.38]Like 15 times.
[94:31.90]And then they can just use it wherever they want for the rest of the entire run of this whole show.
[94:35.50]Everything ready for the big party?
[94:39.60]Why am I like 20% flattened?
[94:40.52]Squirtle, squirtle, squirtle, squirtle, squirtle.

[97:29.09]Just, like, just play a bunch of reruns of, like, storm chasing.
[97:33.19]For, like, five straight days until, like, something to talk about.
[97:42.04]It became clearer.

[181:36.84]I'm fucking gonna get some food.
[181:38.18]Somebody said pizza like an hour and a half ago.
[181:39.62]It's their fault.
[181:46.37]Somebody said pizza like an hour and a half ago.
[181:48.51]It's your fault.
[181:52.87]Toxic paint puke.
[181:57.87]What?
[181:58.84]The new programs are scheduled to begin today at 5 a.m.
[182:13.62]I can't skip ahead.
[182:14.93]I'm softlocked.
[182:15.59]I have to go back and then go forward?
[182:18.21]Remember when you spent like two hours on one level of pinball game?
[182:29.54]I don't like to remember.
[182:37.72]How'd she get up there?
[182:43.56]He's saying, Buh-bye!
[182:53.68]Nintendo!
[182:58.95]You said you'd eat the disk?
[182:59.99]I'm not gonna eat the disk.
[183:04.87]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[183:06.85]Uh, so the plan is, tomorrow, on tomorrow, I'm probably gonna, I don't know what I wanna do tomorrow.
[183:13.47]Tomorrow, I wanna, ah, you're gonna hate this.
[183:15.90]You're gonna hate this.
[183:18.30]But, um, ah, I know a lot of you guys are gonna hate this.
[183:28.16]I wanna, uh, I wanna play Binding of Ice again.
[183:33.76]You're gonna hate this.
[183:38.03]Play it again.
[183:39.11]I'm like addicted to it.
[183:40.41]I wanna like play it so bad.
[183:41.87]I so badly wanna play it.
[183:45.47]I'm like, I've scratched the itch and now it's like I wanna play.
[183:49.32]I'm gonna play Binding of Eyes again tomorrow.
[183:59.88]He's addicted.
[184:05.62]Either that or, uh, there's one other thing that I might do as well.
[184:11.80]It depends on what, uh, it depends on how I feel.
[184:23.68]Not Nancy Drew.
[184:29.95]Hulk, you fucking liar!
[184:33.56]We'll see.
[184:34.96]I'm not sure yet.
[184:36.44]But I do want to play at least, at least, like two to four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow.
[184:43.14]We'll do something else, but I want at least four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow.
[184:46.83]Or two hours, at least.
[184:48.27]At least two hours.
[184:49.15]You understand?
[184:50.83]I'm compromising with you.
[184:59.76]That's a whole stream?
[185:00.86]No, it's not.
[185:02.04]Two hours is like 20% of a stream.
[185:06.66]Like 30% of one stream.
[185:16.60]Two hours.
[185:17.12]But my average stream time is like six to eight hours.
[185:20.86]Two to three hours is like 20 to 40%.
[185:22.74]Like 30%.
[185:22.92]I'm playing it.
[185:24.00]That's all there is to it.
[185:32.91]You said four to six.
[185:34.76]No, didn't I say two to four?
[185:37.80]Play Purple Place?
[185:41.68]What?
[185:42.67]You can't even play that game.
[185:43.61]That game's undownloadable.
[185:50.09]Yes, you can.
[185:54.18]I don't think you guys want me to play Purple Place.
[185:58.01]That's funny for five seconds.
[186:00.03]And then, oh no, he's playing fucking Purple Place.
[186:03.51]I'm gonna leave.
[186:04.37]I'll go do something else for like an hour.
[186:10.41]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[186:12.27]We'll do a couple things tomorrow.
[186:15.45]What?
[186:17.85]Let's say our goodbyes.
[186:24.45]When is JermaCraft coming back?
[186:28.73]Within the next hundred years.
[186:29.71]I'm not going to destroy the disk.
[186:35.39]These are like fun... GameCube games are like collectibles.
[186:38.97]I don't care if I didn't like the game.
[186:41.18]Not this one.
[186:41.68]The one before it.
[186:42.26]I actually liked the one before it, but I was going to eat the disk in my anger.
[186:45.16]These are cool.
[186:47.74]They're nice to collect.
[186:48.78]I'm not going to eat a disk.
[186:50.20]I'm not going to break anything.
[186:55.06]Wendy's thing.
[186:56.14]Wendy's?
[186:56.60]I don't get this.
[187:02.07]What does this have to do with anything?
[187:04.75]What does this Wendy's image have to do with anything?
[187:12.13]It's because of the mic?
[187:16.84]God damn it.
[187:17.68]Okay.
[187:19.56]Let's go back to a little bit earlier today.
[187:22.42]Almost just about six and a half hours ago.
[187:25.13]We had DarkSoul250 from DarkSoul.
[187:27.81]Here's some sober bits.
[187:28.91]Last night was something.
[187:30.53]Anyway, I do like whiskey a lot.
[187:31.85]Not more than vodka.
[187:33.29]But Jameson equals good.
[187:34.39]Johnny Walker equals cigars and assholes.
[187:37.59]Last thing about opinions.
[187:40.07]Everyone's got one.
[187:41.75]Just like how you have one too.
[187:45.91]Appreciate the 250.
[187:50.79]LM, man, thanks for the $5.
[187:55.25]Sound the call to war, Shogun Jerma.
[188:01.27]And some opinions are wrong.
[188:02.71]Say assholes.
[188:05.39]That's the thing.
[188:06.39]You thought I was going to say that next part.
[188:09.09]Nope.
[188:13.96]Thanks for the $5, LM, man.
[188:19.02]Hey, Yenwen, thanks for the $2.50.
[188:21.87]It is my birthday today.
[188:23.25]Happy birthday, Yanwen.
[188:26.08]Uh, I'm almost as old as you, but younger by a few years.
[188:29.72]So you're in the post, you're in the post 30.
[188:32.18]You know what it's like.
[188:33.74]Started drawing this in hopes that I would finish before my birthday, but I ran out of time.
[188:37.98]Ran out of time.
[188:39.34]Hoping that I could use this as a bribe in order to receive an exclusive rat's birthday song.
[188:48.04]Is this the sandwich?
[188:49.06]Is this like the dirty sandwich?
[188:56.77]Let's see.
[189:00.23]Yeah, it is.
[189:03.34]This is the dirty sandwich.
[189:04.84]Let me just show it on screen.
[189:11.95]Well, dirty as in old.
[189:13.81]As in old.
[189:19.65]Get it on here.
[189:32.95]Almost done.
[189:33.69]This is fucking really good.
[189:40.51]Yeah, that's the turkey sandwich that sat in the car for like six and a half hours or a day or something.
[189:46.45]The oblivion sandwich, yeah.
[189:51.51]That's fucking incredible though.
[189:56.90]It's so good.
[189:59.90]It's so fucking good.
[190:05.37]Thank you for this.
[190:06.31]And happy birthday.
[190:07.07]And you want a rat, uh... Let's see if I can get it.
[190:13.13]Here we go.
[190:16.21]Hey, happy birthday.
[190:17.91]Happy birthday, Genwen.
[190:18.84]From the rats.
[190:20.94]Me.
[190:21.56]Me.
[190:27.13]Just found one.
[190:28.95]We just ran by.
[190:29.79]It was pretty wild.
[190:36.38]That's kind of a problem.
[190:37.22]Where are they coming in from?
[190:41.30]But thank you again.
[190:41.92]And thanks for the insanely talented artwork.
[190:44.39]You got some skill here.
[190:46.93]Real skill.
[190:48.77]Happy birthday.
[190:49.93]Hope it's a good one.
[190:54.56]Oh shit, I lost my fucking... I lost my stream.
[190:58.00]I lost my stream.
[190:59.86]There it is.
[191:02.15]Hey, LM Man!
[191:03.19]Another $5 from LM Man.
[191:03.95]My brain is way too small for those.
[191:21.34]I'm capable of throwing a pinball against the wall and getting angry.
[191:27.37]I do not have the patience to play any of those games like that.
[191:30.79]I've seen a lot of people say, dude, you should play Civilization.
[191:33.69]It would be so much fun.
[191:35.37]Man, you should check out Europa, whatever it's called.
[191:40.04]What's it called?
[191:41.56]What's that one called?
[191:44.38]There's like three of them, right?
[191:52.61]Yeah, Europa Universales, yeah.
[191:55.23]I've heard that.
[191:55.91]I've heard, um... What's the other one?
[191:58.56]There's another one that's really popular.
[192:02.08]What the hell is it called?
[192:06.04]Crusader Kings!
[192:07.14]There it is, yeah.
[192:09.38]Those games take, like, dozens of hours to even understand how to play them correctly.
[192:15.86]I would get annoyed and bored and frustrated in the first four hours, and it would be...
[192:22.15]I couldn't.
[192:22.91]I would just lose my mind.
[192:24.03]I just don't have the brain patience for games like that.
[192:27.32]Even on my own time.
[192:28.98]Something like that is like, hey, you wanna play Crusader Kings?
[192:30.94]I'd be like, no.
[192:33.78]No, not in a million years.
[192:34.92]Like, I wouldn't even do that on my own time.
[192:38.96]Even, like, before streaming, that's something I just wouldn't play.
[192:50.62]I need to throw rocks at people.
[192:52.14]You know what I mean?
[192:53.82]I gotta roll a pinball rock into a guy.
[192:57.44]That's pretty much what you saw today was the extent of most of the strategy games you'll see me play on this channel.
[193:06.87]What about Stronghold 2?
[193:08.71]Total Warhammer 2 is easy to learn.
[193:14.23]Maybe.
[193:16.39]But we're talking about me.
[193:19.90]We are talking about me.
[193:24.26]But, probably not.
[193:24.98]You'll probably never see a game like that on this channel.
[193:28.04]And that's one I could be really certain of.
[193:33.20]Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[193:34.46]If you want to play a better voice-activated military game, find a copy of Tom Clancy End War.
[193:39.28]I don't think the PC Steam version is voice-activated, though.
[193:42.22]So find a PS3 or Xbox Free Xbox version if you want to try it.
[193:46.77]Hmm.
[193:50.36]I love microphone games, they're fun.
[193:55.84]General Arse, thanks for the $14, 1400 bits from General Arse.
[193:59.72]Jerma, where did you get that Flint water?
[194:03.14]What do you mean, Flint water?
[194:04.38]Is that what they have on the shelves?
[194:05.62]What the fuck are you talking about?
[194:15.55]Oh, I'm drinking coffee!
[194:16.83]I'm drinking coffee!
[194:24.92]it's coffee it's not it's not it's coffee it's good I like it no but there ain't nothing on the shelves anymore that's why I've I've got I got I bought some of this like fiji water because that's the only thing that was existed
[194:51.50]People go buy all the regular bottled water and they leave the Fiji.
[194:58.68]Like, oh, shit.
[194:59.64]Like, I gotta buy, like, a case of Fiji?
[195:01.96]Because nobody's gonna buy the case of Fiji.
[195:13.65]It's good, though.
[195:14.63]I mean, I love this stuff.
[195:15.91]It's great.
[195:16.85]It's really good, but I don't really wanna buy cases of it.
[195:24.32]Anyways.
[195:24.62]I would advise against doing that.
[195:27.14]That's not a good idea.
[195:28.26]I would advise against doing that.
[195:46.94]Uh, Sir Linkerton, thanks for the $5.
[195:48.46]Hey Jerma, glad to make it to a stream.
[195:50.44]I usually watch on YouTube.
[195:52.02]Thanks for giving us all a distraction from the scary times the world is in right now.
[195:56.62]Will there be another keep talking stream with Joel?
[196:00.02]Uh, probably not.
[196:01.44]We'll probably move on to something else if we ever play something again.
[196:04.48]If we ever, ever, Maka, Esh, Jerma, Pluto, if we ever, why do you say that?
[196:07.94]Ever?
[196:08.16]What does that mean?
[196:09.24]It means he's never going to play with him again.
[196:10.74]He must hate Joel.
[196:11.68]I think he hates Joel.
[196:12.92]I think he hates Joel.
[196:14.64]He said ever.
[196:16.57]Yeah, so we'll probably... When did we ever do something again?
[196:19.30]We'll probably do something else.
[196:24.30]New games come out.
[196:24.98]They're worth playing.
[196:31.99]He punched Joel.
[196:33.47]I did not do that.
[196:35.55]I didn't do that.
[196:36.17]You're a liar and you're making that up.
[196:42.46]New games aren't coming out.
[196:43.74]Yes, they are.
[196:44.22]There's like three or four new games coming out over the next few months.
[196:55.79]Hey, Freudian.
[196:56.55]I missed this.
[196:56.93]This is a lot of money.
[196:57.55]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $40.
[196:59.01]4,000 bits from Freudian Weapon.
[197:03.50]That's just shy of fucking $50, dude.
[197:06.34]Thank you.
[197:07.64]Doom and Resident Evil 3 got delayed.
[197:09.08]Oh, fuck, really?
[197:13.34]It's unfortunate.
[197:15.56]Yes.
[197:15.66]Take some precautions when you do anything.
[197:16.98]When you go anywhere.
[197:40.80]Try to limit the amount that you go out to, especially to places that have a lot of people in them, especially if you're in an area that you know has seen cases.
[197:51.97]There's some countries that are in lockdown right now.
[197:54.34]Just be careful and be smart.
[198:02.69]Yeah, well, like I said the other day, and yesterday too, hopefully this blows over pretty soon.
[198:07.42]Hopefully we can get ahead of this.
[198:10.90]It's been a while since something like this has happened, right?
[198:16.94]When was the last big, kind of scary pandemic?
[198:20.60]H1N1?
[198:21.18]SARS or something?
[198:29.38]But not this big.
[198:30.16]Yeah, like 2003.
[198:33.22]ebola but I don't think ebola was this widespread around what was I don't think I don't remember it being like that was it not that I remember I mean like Disney world is closed that's not that's not even close to what how scary you know well that not even what I mean not even close like they're they closed Disney world
[198:57.46]Disney World has never been closed.
[198:59.38]Ever.
[198:59.96]In the history of it ever being opened.
[199:02.10]Except for only, I think, two or three days.
[199:05.36]So... This is, I guess, enough to warrant doing something like that.
[199:13.18]Last time Disney World was closed was on 9-11.
[199:14.84]Yeah.
[199:20.62]I mean, you don't just close it.
[199:22.16]I mean, the whole park is... You can't even go.
[199:33.53]But, like, hopefully this is all over soon and we can kind of get back to normal over the next few months.
[199:39.63]When summertime kind of really rolls around here, especially in the U.S.
[199:43.71]Hopefully, um, cases die down and it can, you know, we can move on.
[199:50.23]Hope so.
[199:53.61]But be careful.
[199:56.36]Uh, Saints got robbed.
[199:57.38]Thanks for the $5.
[199:58.38]Just $5.
[199:59.06]Thank you, Saints got robbed.
[200:02.24]Obeliskos, thanks for the three dollars.
[200:06.82]Been watching your content since 2011.
[200:09.60]Your streams have helped me get through a lot of rough patches, especially recently.
[200:13.32]Also, your now withered muscles helped encourage me to get fucking huge while I'm still somewhat young.
[200:19.89]Though lately I've been eating tahini paste and doing bicep curls for YouTube sub celebrations, and I never felt better about myself.
[200:26.91]Thank you for the near decade of content, and for always striving to be the best gamer you can be.
[200:31.27]Much love.
[200:32.45]Good luck to you.
[200:33.97]I never condoned that.
[200:35.37]I never told anyone to do that.
[200:36.81]Do not do that.
[200:37.83]You're doing that on your own.
[200:39.51]Good luck.
[200:40.19]Thank you.
[200:44.19]Thank you, Cell Juniors, for the $5.
[200:46.90]Funny streamer, people happy.
[200:51.76]Uh, NokaNoka, thanks for the $3.
[200:53.92]Jerma, love seeing you play Pokémon Channel today.
[200:56.23]Your Viva Piñata streams made me remember it being a game I always wanted as a teen.
[200:59.91]So I actually went and bought a copy.
[201:03.51]Hope to see you stream it more.
[201:04.55]It's so chaotically cute.
[201:06.49]Cute games on stream is always great.
[201:07.87]Have a good day.
[201:09.45]You too.
[201:11.63]You will see the return of Viva Piñata.
[201:16.31]I have the second one.
[201:17.09]I'm ready to go.
[201:18.59]Just need to pick a day to do it.
[201:23.72]Uh, Plymbo, thanks for the $3, Pokémon ruins my brain to the point that it made me enter my credit card information and give you money.
[201:34.98]Um, I'm sorry to hear that.
[201:40.44]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[201:41.56]Nerma, can you admit you farted?
[201:44.38]It's okay, we all shit ourselves from time to time.
[201:46.54]That didn't, I didn't, but it sounded like it and that's funny.
[201:50.81]Peaceful Haley again, thanks for $2.50.
[201:54.01]Jerma, you obviously don't know your Star Wars lore.
[201:57.17]Obi-Wan's saber has always been blue.
[201:59.72]He only used a green saber once.
[202:01.88]When he... Spoiler!
[202:02.84]I'm not reading spoilers.
[202:07.96]Luke used Anakin's blue saber, and he made his own saber, which was green.
[202:11.82]Shaking my head, Jerma.
[202:12.54]Come on.
[202:12.82]If you need to know Star Wars lore, come to me.
[202:16.59]I wasn't doing Star Wars lore.
[202:17.69]That was a fucking beam spear.
[202:19.61]That's why I said it incorrectly.
[202:22.95]Because that's not a reference to any Disney-related properties.
[202:31.61]But thanks for the five dollars.
[202:34.79]Return that shirt.
[202:36.61]No.
[202:37.57]I will continue to wear it.
[202:40.98]And pretend to be a fan of the show.
[202:45.00]Movies.
[202:46.40]And the movies.
[202:47.56]And the show.
[202:48.54]There's a show.
[202:49.50]I can say that there's a show.
[202:51.10]There's a show.
[202:54.10]Hey, LoopyFA, thanks for the thousand bits, Loopy.
[202:58.80]No message, just ten fucking dollars.
[203:02.48]Let's roll the credits.
[203:06.00]Janitor's gonna come sweep by you here.
[203:10.94]Here come the credits.
[203:12.08]Thanks for watching.
[203:12.74]Thanks for sticking around.
[203:13.44]We'll see you tomorrow for more stuff.
[203:20.88]Thanks, everybody.
[203:23.50]I want to play Binding of Isaac.
[203:24.82]It's fun.
[203:27.22]Man.
[203:28.26]I scratched this and I have to keep scratching it.
[203:31.30]Also, there's a couple other things I want to do.
[203:33.85]We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[203:37.39]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[203:40.45]Thanks again.
[203:40.99]And thank you to Thragnell for the $5.
[203:43.97]Buy better coffee instead of that curdling swill from yesterday.
[203:47.80]No, look at... That is a nice cold brew.
[203:52.13]That coffee that I'm drinking is a cold brew that you keep in the fridge.
[203:55.57]It's a nice cold brew.
[203:56.87]The reason why it looks so gross is because I put almond milk in it, and I sit here and I drink it, and I sip on it for an hour.
[204:03.53]And what happens is, the almond milk separates from the coffee and looks like shit.
[204:10.24]It's not the coffee, it's the almond milk I'm putting in it.
[204:12.36]But I like almond milk.
[204:13.26]I like putting almond milk in my coffee.
[204:18.56]Oh, that's why it looks like that.
[204:19.66]It's a nice cold brew, what you're seeing.
[204:27.67]Why not mix it with a spoon?
[204:28.88]Because I don't have a spoon up in my office.
[204:32.24]I don't have a spoon up here.
[204:35.82]What am I going to do with it?
[204:39.08]Am I going to put my finger in it?
[204:47.21]No, that's gross.
[204:50.71]Hey, FrozenThor516, thanks for the 250.
[204:53.24]Hey, Jerma, thanks for the stream.
[204:54.12]As usual, you said you never played any of the Pokémon games before.
[204:56.66]What if you consider playing them?
[204:58.90]Perhaps the new one that came out for the Switch with silly rules such as chat picks what Pokémon you can use.
[205:04.96]Stuff like that.
[205:06.49]Again, thanks for the stream and keep being awesome.
[205:09.77]I will try.
[205:10.33]I'm glad you think that.
[205:13.03]I'll try to strive for better.
[205:14.71]I can be better.
[205:15.21]I can always be better, right?
[205:18.63]Um, I don't, I don't, I don't really want to play Pokémon.
[205:23.09]Pokémon is, it's cool, I respect the franchise, but I don't have any interest in it at all.
[205:30.19]I really don't.
[205:31.25]Zero.
[205:33.89]Like, unless it's a TV game, or like, take pictures with Pikachu.
[205:38.12]I don't actually really care at all about the mainline Pokémon games.
[205:44.44]I just never have, and I never do, and I never will.
[205:47.83]Just the way it is.
[205:48.53]Sorry.
[205:52.89]It's the way it is.
[206:00.69]But thank you for the suggestion.
[206:01.65]As others have said, I'm glad you chill here with... I'm glad to chill here with you guys while we're quarantined.
[206:07.46]Video games are a great time killer.
[206:10.06]I've been playing Cities Skylines over the past couple of days, and I definitely recommend it for wasting time.
[206:14.54]I actually planned on streaming Cities Skylines.
[206:17.96]Should I?
[206:19.96]We talked about that a few weeks ago, like a month or two ago, right?
[206:25.86]Would that be fun?
[206:26.76]Can I handle that?
[206:29.74]I want to be very clear about this.
[206:32.24]Can I handle that?
[206:34.79]Like, can I handle that one?
[206:37.31]Absolutely not.
[206:37.99]Yes, do it tomorrow.
[206:40.65]Can I fucking handle that?
[206:41.81]Is that like a, I gotta sit there and learn the whole game for like 12 hours?
[206:47.02]It's easier than SimCity.
[206:52.64]Doesn't take that long.
[206:53.64]It's good.
[206:55.34]There's some systems you kind of need to learn.
[206:57.46]It's 30 minutes to learn.
[206:59.36]It's easy to pick up.
[207:00.10]It's easy.
[207:00.54]It's super simple.
[207:04.19]Okay.
[207:08.25]Okay.
[207:09.91]We'll do it tomorrow.
[207:12.29]Alright, we'll do it tomorrow.
[207:13.39]We'll play Cities Skylines tomorrow.
[207:17.95]But I'm getting my fucking couple hours of Binding of Eyes again.
[207:25.35]We'll do that tomorrow.
[207:25.85]And that's the end.
[207:31.82]Thanks for watching.
[207:32.28]We'll see you tomorrow.
[207:33.42]Same time, around 3, 4 p.m.
[207:35.98]Pacific.
[207:38.54]And goodbye and goodnight.
[207:42.99]Surgilbutt, right at the end, 250.
[207:44.83]Got back from work to see you were still streaming.
[207:46.27]I had a co-worker act totally normal all shift and start violently coughing into the trash can next to him.
[207:51.24]Jesus.
[207:52.50]I told him, hey, I love you, but please don't cough on the line.
[207:56.20]We had to decontaminate the entire kitchen mid-shift.
[207:59.28]That shit's scary.
[208:01.22]Glad I could share a laugh after today.
[208:02.94]That's not good.
[208:08.14]He's gotta be careful.
[208:09.18]I mean, here's the thing, though.
[208:11.97]There's...
[208:13.54]There's like coughing and sneezing and there's like normal stuff.
[208:18.41]And it's like, is that... What's wrong with that person?
[208:20.79]You don't want to get too... Too into it and too like hysteria.
[208:25.85]You know what I mean?
[208:26.27]That's how it's... Somebody just sneezed in this place I am.
[208:29.85]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[208:31.07]You know what I mean?
[208:31.49]You just gotta be careful.
[208:34.36]It's like... Jacket just said it's allergy season two.
[208:39.22]So...
[208:41.62]There is enough to be concerned about, for sure.
[208:45.59]But we just, we gotta be careful.
[208:49.03]I know it's scary and it's not a fun time for really anybody.
[208:52.43]But we don't also want to feed into the absolute hysteria.
[209:00.27]Which you never know.
[209:01.15]I know, but, I know but still, but it's the same reason you got people buying 30 fucking rolls of toilet paper.
[209:08.47]Like, they, like, I've seen the images of people that got, like, a full, a full closet of, like, 5,000 rolls of toilet paper.
[209:17.63]It's like, that's, that's a, that's a lot.
[209:21.37]That's a lot.
[209:22.13]Um, people buy, like, 10 gallons of milk.
[209:26.61]Like, milk goes bad in, like, not even 12 days, right?
[209:30.79]Like, why are you buying 10 gallons of milk?
[209:34.58]Who's gonna drink all that milk in the next, like, week or two?
[209:40.22]Just freeze it.
[209:44.04]People are freezing milk?
[209:48.92]If I ever put milk in my freezer, I'm just, that's... I'm gonna freeze 9 gallons of milk?
[209:58.74]And you got, like, the people that are buying all this shit and then they're selling it on, like, the internet for, like, fucking a thousand percent more.
[210:06.95]It's like, God, if people are just trying to get, like, a one stack of toilet paper and now you're talking about they might have to, it's not there because everyone's been panicking and buying it all.
[210:16.25]And you got these guys that are going in there and buying it to sell it to those people that didn't get there in time at, like, a twenty thousand percent premium.
[210:25.35]It's like, Jesus.
[210:27.33]In a pandemic, aren't we supposed to help each other?
[210:31.85]You know what I'm saying?
[210:32.81]That seems a little strange.
[210:40.14]No!
[210:44.55]I feel the same, okay.
[210:46.55]When there was like a baseball game or something.
[210:49.07]And it's like, oh, maybe like three or four of us will go to the game.
[210:52.66]Oh, okay, yeah.
[210:53.92]How much are tickets?
[210:54.68]Oh, there are none left.
[210:56.16]Oh, there are no more tickets left.
[210:57.74]Oh, looks like we're gonna walk out to the front of fucking Fenway Park.
[211:01.72]Hey, I got tickets for you.
[211:03.48]200 bucks for the fucking nosebleeds.
[211:05.94]Okay, thanks.
[211:12.73]Cool.
[211:14.24]But what's that again?
[211:15.38]Those are like $41 seats.
[211:23.69]Boomer ball?
[211:29.79]Gerber the communist.
[211:32.80]What?
[211:33.04]That is not communist.
[211:37.50]I'm seeing people put...
[211:40.54]70 fucking containers of, like, cottonel in the back of their car is like, you go, dude, like, sorry, I must be a communist.
[211:53.47]Sorry, excuse me, ma'am and sir, I'm a communist and I don't agree with the fact that you have your whole entire fucking Subaru Outback full of toilet paper.
[212:06.40]That's not, that's not the way it is.
[212:19.13]He's going on a socialist rant.
[212:21.39]No, I am not.
[212:22.37]That's not what that is.
[212:23.87]Not even close.
[212:26.01]Don't twist it.
[212:26.93]Don't twist it on me.
[212:28.01]Don't twist it.
[212:30.53]Don't twist it on me.
[212:32.05]Don't twist it.
[212:35.01]I don't want to hear from any of you starting to twist what's happening to me.
[212:39.75]What's going on?
[212:41.47]Don't twist.
[212:42.55]I don't want anybody to twist this on what's happening.
[212:50.33]Sorry.
[212:50.85]I had something.
[212:52.13]Alright.
[212:53.43]I don't want you... Don't twist it on me.
[212:55.07]That's not what I was saying.
[213:01.87]Anyways, have a great day.
[213:02.90]Have a great rest of your night.
[213:03.64]I'll see you later.
[213:06.16]Goobery Juice, thanks for $2.50.
[213:07.36]You're right at the buzzer here.
[213:09.62]No, like, for real, Jerma, it's okay.
[213:10.96]You can admit that you farted.
[213:20.92]We all do it.
[213:21.48]There's no reason to be embarrassed about it.
[213:23.08]I mean, not all of us fart live on stream in front of thousands of people.
[213:27.00]A small percentage of which may be into farts.
[213:30.78]I mean, that would be fucking embarrassing.
[213:32.40]But, you know, it's okay if you do.
[213:33.94]Why did I read that out loud?
[213:37.44]Okay.
[213:38.90]Goodbye.
[213:39.52]Good night.
[213:39.90]See you tomorrow.
[213:40.99]Have a fucking wonderful rest of your evening.
[213:43.93]City Skylines and Binding of Isaac tomorrow.
[213:46.35]See you soon.
[213:46.87]Good night.
[213:47.41]Take care.
[214:06.64]Bye.
[214:06.96]Sorry, there was a delay on the bye.
