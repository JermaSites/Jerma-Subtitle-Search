[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.68]You got Homa, you got Modge, you got Bot.
[00:05.93]All of them.
[00:07.77]They're all in the same place at the same time.
[00:09.15]They're all driving fucking cars around.
[00:12.15]That's the plan for tonight.
[00:13.15]How you guys doing?
[00:20.59]Simpsons hit and run.
[00:21.69]Got it to work.
[00:24.19]There was a theory that I might not have gotten it to work.
[00:28.37]But we delayed...
[00:31.25]And, uh, Kill Code came through with the... some... some files, some patches.
[00:39.61]And I was like, well, would you look at that?
[00:45.27]So we can play it!
[00:47.81]I do, uh, I own it on PlayStation 2, but... I figured, try to get it on PC to work, right?
[00:57.82]So that's what we're doing.
[00:58.55]Give me a minute.
[00:59.23]I'm just going to sip my coffee and make sure I have my OBS configured.
[01:03.73]I'll see you guys real soon.
[02:04.00]That just kind of jumped out at you, didn't it?
[02:06.74]Sorry about that.
[02:10.31]I'm sorry.
[02:13.19]You know what I wish?
[02:14.05]Here's the thing.
[02:14.69]You know what I would love?
[02:22.02]I would love if OBS had a feature where I could, like, when I activate a source, right?
[02:28.48]And maybe they do.
[02:29.12]I... Hold on.
[02:31.73]Turn that down for a second.
[02:33.23]If I could, like, have a way, there's a plugin where I can make it so every time I activate a source, it slowly comes up from zero.
[02:40.91]That might be hard to do, but, man, I wish I could do that, because some of these games, they just blow your ears out.
[02:49.66]But...
[02:51.22]Here it is!
[02:52.71]Simpsons Hit and Run working on PC.
[02:55.33]This is actually on PC and there are like a bunch of mods and shit that you need to have to get this to work.
[03:02.19]So... It is possible.
[03:08.21]I don't have any like funny mods.
[03:09.75]This is not like a funny mod thing.
[03:11.85]This is like get the game to work effectively funny mod thing.
[03:20.85]So, are you ready?
[03:22.07]How do we go for audio?
[03:27.14]No, it's not a funny mod.
[03:35.48]Sounds pretty good.
[03:36.78]Louder?
[03:38.52]It's kinda loud?
[03:42.04]How's that?
[03:44.30]That's probably better.
[03:46.50]So, you can still hear me.
[03:51.85]What have we got?
[03:52.31]So we got... And plus I can have a controller plugged in.
[03:54.84]That's the best part.
[03:57.84]Alright.
[03:59.96]People have been waiting for this for a long time.
[04:02.12]I don't see enough hype in the chat right now.
[04:04.42]You know?
[04:04.73]I want you all to spell it out.
[04:06.87]In one gigantic letter.
[04:08.65]You know?
[04:09.33]You all have to work on H. And then P. And then E. The one ResidentSleeper.
[04:27.04]And you stand out so much.
[04:28.70]If you're resident sleepering right now, you are.
[04:31.48]I can see.
[04:31.98]Look at that toy train that guy's got there.
[04:35.68]Let's go.
[04:39.86]There's even 3D animations.
[04:42.65]Oh, god damn it.
[04:43.17]It's not that.
[04:44.49]Turn it up.
[04:48.21]Why is it so low?
[04:49.25]Okay.
[04:57.01]I can't buff it.
[05:07.36]We'll fix it.
[05:12.92]This reminds me of when... Remember when they did that episode where Homer went into the 3D world?
[05:22.41]And it was incredibly off-putting.
[05:25.84]Alright, so let's move around.
[05:27.06]Talk to Marge.
[05:30.02]Let's jump.
[05:31.64]Let's move.
[05:35.47]Let's sprint.
[05:40.55]This actually doesn't look that bad.
[05:44.15]How's that?
[05:44.47]The audio sounds like it's okay right now.
[05:48.62]Where's, uh, how do I...
[05:55.19]Turn it up a little bit.
[05:57.67]Voice and sound.
[06:04.59]Music a little bit.
[06:05.59]Yeah!
[06:07.87]Is that better?
[06:11.67]That sounds alright.
[06:13.42]Alright Marge, what do you got?
[06:14.32]Is this fully voice acted?
[06:16.44]Homie, somebody ate every dessert in the house.
[06:19.90]I need you to run to the store and pick up some of that ice cream with the miniature pies in it.
[06:25.26]Homie, you have to go to the store and pick up that ice cream.
[06:30.78]Hire me.
[06:31.54]Hire me.
[06:31.96]Do it.
[06:33.32]Go to the Quickie Mart and purchase some ice cream and cola.
[06:37.43]It's crashing time.
[06:40.19]Homer, that's not a nice thing to say.
[06:42.73]It's crashing time.
[06:46.71]Drive to the Quickie Mart.
[06:53.89]This is like a... Can you crash into people?
[06:56.57]No.
[06:58.47]This is like a licensed TV video game.
[07:03.02]You actually can run... That's... I can't believe that.
[07:05.88]I don't believe it.
[07:07.32]I don't believe you can do that.
[07:08.66]What?
[07:16.68]I thought they were gonna jump out of the way.
[07:18.08]I'm very surprised.
[07:20.54]Alright, drive to the quickie mart.
[07:26.68]And I'm getting points for this.
[07:32.42]Alright, okay, I gotta get my controller set up.
[07:37.76]What is this for?
[07:38.40]Oh wait, there's a coin!
[07:48.50]Alright, this is a puzzle.
[07:50.94]You get on the roof?
[07:54.97]There's a sprint, right?
[07:55.97]Oops.
[07:57.39]I might have to change some button configurations here.
[07:59.23]Because right now, B is run.
[08:07.23]That B and A don't work together is run and then jump.
[08:12.00]I have it on the Dark Souls settings.
[08:13.60]Hold on.
[08:15.88]What does this do?
[08:17.92]Oh, I can kick!
[08:18.76]Alright, this is kinda cool.
[08:23.69]Who made this game?
[08:25.93]Can I just... vandalize?
[08:44.10]FromSoftware made this game.
[08:46.32]Now imagine if they did.
[08:47.14]Hey, yeah, hey, uh... Okay, hey, Appu, I need a, uh, I need to get myself some ice cream and some extra cola.
[09:09.53]Hire me!
[09:10.15]I'm available!

[09:13.25]New shirt!
[09:20.63]Oh wait, no.
[09:25.21]That's definitely the best one.
[09:37.88]So this is what you do with coins, huh?
[09:42.75]Okay.
[09:43.95]How do I talk to Milhouse?
[09:44.89]Hey, Milhouse.
[09:48.47]I don't have any problems, Milhouse.
[09:51.38]Hey, here.
[09:52.10]I'll help you.
[09:52.80]I'll help you.

[10:17.90]Now, let's go back.
[10:18.56]Come on, I love how it tells you, okay, I got a... I have a handbrake.
[10:27.70]Why am I playing the shittiest games?
[10:32.76]Hold on.
[10:34.58]I'm gonna give you a quick story.
[10:37.54]This is one of the most requested games.
[10:40.56]on this whole channel.
[10:43.94]I think people have been telling me to play this game through messages and in chat for two years.
[10:51.75]So I... It's a... Come on!
[11:02.60]One guy said that.
[11:03.44]Well, I have to comment on it.
[11:06.77]Alright, hold on.
[11:09.81]Can you dive out of the car?
[11:12.79]No, you can't.
[11:18.34]Alright, you can't kill Marge.
[11:30.81]Alright, I got what you needed.
[11:31.59]Raise Principal Skinner to the school and give Lisa her science project.
[11:34.53]Why do I have to erase the principal?
[11:35.59]Collect Lisa's science project.
[11:57.26]It's... Alright.
[11:58.60]Drive to the school.
[12:00.30]Where's Principal Skinner?

[12:15.92]Okay, that person just tried to kill me.
[12:19.85]That person tried to kill me.
[12:24.85]Two out of two.
[12:32.78]How do you like it?
[12:33.88]Can I run him off the road?
[12:34.64]Are we gonna get that all game?
[12:37.98]I think we're gonna get that all game, aren't we?
[12:40.50]Whoa!

[12:41.86]Wait, through what door?
[12:43.46]Nothing lasts forever.
[13:04.38]I beat him, right?
[13:10.86]The front door.

[13:14.49]Oh, there you are.
[13:15.55]Thanks for bringing me my model of the digestive system.
[13:18.93]Thanks for bringing me the model of the digestive system.
[13:21.75]Where's the gallbladder?
[13:23.21]I'm available.
[13:25.63]By the way, Dad, Mom called.
[13:29.33]She says she needs to talk to you at home before you go to work.
[13:33.51]What's this?
[13:33.85]Oh, it's the principal's office.
[13:40.00]What?
[13:40.16]That's not good.
[13:41.82]I want that one, so that's 125 points.
[14:04.41]Why would you install- install asbestos in a school?
[14:16.00]Oh.
[14:20.42]I didn't know that's a- I thought I was moving the- I thought I was moving the fucking- I thought I was moving the bookcase.
[14:26.67]I didn't know I was pulling the fire alarm.
[14:34.83]Alright, let's go.
[14:39.97]Press all the actions.
[14:46.41]Are there more than one?
[14:47.17]No, that's it.
[14:52.04]I got his.
[14:52.52]Oh, wait, no, no.
[14:56.62]It's like a point-and-click adventure game.
[15:00.50]You can press every button.
[15:09.67]There's a lot of lore.
[15:12.26]That's cool.
[15:14.84]What's all the dice for?
[15:20.14]Who are you?
[15:22.62]Race 4, wager race.
[15:24.75]Entry fee 20, time to beat 315.
[15:26.53]Best time, difficulty medium.
[15:28.53]Complete an entire lap before time runs out.
[15:39.03]An entire lap.
[15:42.55]Can I get 60 bucks for doing this?
[15:46.55]I guess I have to do it before I can talk about how I did it.
[15:49.58]This is a medium.
[15:55.96]Just don't run into anything.
[15:57.50]Just do it gently and get it correct.
[16:04.24]No!
[16:04.64]I'm fine.
[16:17.11]I'm thinking... I got it!
[16:19.70]What the fuck was that?
[16:23.54]Wait, what?
[16:25.44]Oh, that's not it.
[16:26.28]I thought that was a complete lap for a second.
[16:28.48]Okay.
[16:29.98]Well, I thought that was it.
[16:31.50]I thought that was like the end.
[16:35.10]What was that big circle?
[16:36.32]I don't think I'm gonna get it now.
[16:48.97]This car's gonna explode.
[17:02.42]I still might get it.
[17:09.75]He's gonna rage a lot this stream.
[17:12.05]What?
[17:12.33]It's The Simpsons!
[17:13.97]How can you get mad at Homer Simpson?
[17:20.69]Am I gonna eat my own words in like 45 minutes?
[17:36.94]Alright, this is a little road.
[17:43.38]If I bump into anybody else, I'm gonna explode.
[17:45.89]Use the shortcuts!
[17:51.97]Uh... I think I wanna just try to win the first race ever.
[18:05.72]Is that it?
[18:07.10]Oh my god, son of a... I'm almost there.
[18:14.66]I'm really close.
[18:25.77]Come on, it's right there!
[18:28.63]I did it.
[18:30.23]No, I didn't.
[18:30.85]What the fuck?
[18:32.23]What?! !
[18:37.03]I'm not going to get it.
[18:39.95]I'm not going to get it.
[18:40.97]I'm not going to get it.
[18:42.37]I'm not going to get it.
[18:43.89]I got it.
[18:45.57]No, I didn't.
[18:46.20]No, I didn't.
[18:46.72]Where's the end?
[18:47.12]Oh!
[19:14.18]I can do that.
[19:16.06]I can do that.
[19:18.56]I know I can do that.
[19:20.70]Because I didn't know that the blue circle wasn't the end of the race.
[19:23.96]So I turned around and ran into the wall.
[19:28.89]You didn't use any of the shortcuts.
[19:30.49]Well... No, this car is all fucked up.
[19:36.45]I can't do it yet.
[19:43.02]What is this?
[19:43.46]Is it pay-in spray?
[19:49.42]I need to, like, drive my car into the garage.
[19:59.48]Kick the kids into the road!
[20:04.75]Easy, psycho!
[20:12.97]Holy shit!
[20:14.15]Ooh.
[20:29.71]How much is this?
[20:30.29]Can I, like, repair this?
[20:36.48]Can you come and get me?
[20:37.98]I'll pay you in back rubs.
[20:42.35]Who did I just call to come get me?
[20:46.75]Who just came to get me?
[20:55.18]I just called me.
[21:00.16]Well, somebody said that you can go to the phone.
[21:06.39]I mean, I see a giant wrench, so let me pick that up.
[21:10.58]That's... Okay, you pick up the giant wrenches.
[21:12.60]Ooh, the vibration's tickling my feet.
[21:17.92]I wish I had a dog with a saddle.
[21:19.67]Alright, what do you got, Marge?
[21:27.73]Homer, go talk to Ned Flanders.
[21:29.69]He seems miffed and PO'd.
[21:32.27]Why me?
[21:33.08]I'm the world's greatest neighbor.
[21:34.78]I even have a mug to that effect.
[21:39.70]The phone is for when the car is completely destroyed.
[21:43.34]Alright, so go to Flandre's house and talk to Ned, but first I'm going to take some pizza coins.
[21:55.95]What else is back here?
[21:56.71]There's a lot of shit back here.
[21:59.80]What is this?
[22:01.14]A buzz card.
[22:02.62]Hmm.
[22:05.62]Hmm.
[22:09.13]Uh, okay, I just turned on the grill?
[22:14.95]What is this shit in my backyard?
[22:16.61]I can go on the swing.
[22:22.85]No?
[22:23.69]I guess you can't go on the swing.
[22:25.57]Interesting.
[22:26.05]Okay.
[22:32.75]So, I wanna get up here.
[22:33.85]Probably have to go on the roof somehow.
[22:42.79]There's probably a drop down from the roof.
[22:46.23]There's a, okay, there's a double jump.
[22:47.92]I did not know that we, I, why would I know, why would I think there was a double jump?
[22:53.86]There's a double jump.
[22:59.54]Oh, almost.
[23:05.72]I can sell this on the internet.
[23:07.66]You mean I gotta get more?
[23:18.77]Alright, let's go to Flanders.
[23:19.77]Please don't sue!
[23:32.94]Hey, Flanders.
[23:33.96]I'm all in a dither, Homer.
[23:35.20]So many of my possessions have disappeared.
[23:37.88]I called the police to find the culprit.
[23:39.71]Culprit, eh?
[23:40.89]My lawnmower, my cooler, my lawn chair, a family portrait, even Rod's inhaler.
[23:46.11]What kind of sick individual would take this stuff?
[23:48.53]Oh, no.
[23:49.21]I borrowed all of Flanders' stuff.
[23:50.89]Quick, think of an excuse to get out of here.
[23:53.00]Uh, excuse me, I think I have to go shuck some corn.
[24:01.01]Alright, collect all six of Ned's lost items before the time runs out.
[24:06.15]Get into your vehicle.
[24:08.57]So I have to go find all of Ned Flanders' stuff.
[24:11.53]Find his tuxedo.
[24:15.96]Do I have to get out of the car?
[24:18.20]No, I don't.
[24:19.02]Okay.
[24:19.80]Find the lawnmower.
[24:25.78]I can't I can't talk to you right now.

[25:02.36]I need a lawn chair.
[25:04.38]Oh, God.
[25:04.82]Why?
[25:05.00]Get out of the way.
[25:12.42]I just killed him.
[25:15.30]There's a bunch of shit.
[25:16.24]Oh, wait.
[25:16.64]I don't care about anything else.
[25:17.76]Just give me the coins.
[25:22.13]Holy shit, that's more money than I've ever seen.
[25:27.60]I got plenty of time.
[25:30.46]I can finally- I can buy the huge, fat Homer outfit.
[25:33.40]I can't wait.
[25:46.77]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[25:48.63]What a classic game, huh?
[25:49.39]Got it.
[25:49.69]Wait, before the cops?
[26:16.06]Is there a Wanted level in this game?
[26:17.72]No, there's not.
[26:23.01]Is there?
[26:23.61]There is.
[26:27.39]How the hell does that work?
[26:37.41]Homer is a criminal.
[26:40.96]Well, howdy-dly-ho, Homer!
[26:42.34]See?
[26:45.96]Thanks, neighbor!
[26:46.34]I'm kidding, that's not me doing it for real.
[26:47.70]Cool.
[26:47.80]Alright, hold on.
[26:48.14]I wanted to see if I could... Let me just look at stuff.
[26:50.01]There's money everywhere.
[27:13.99]Let me just examine people's backyards.
[27:18.32]What's in Flanders' backyard?
[27:20.40]Tire swing.
[27:24.20]That's kind of cool.
[27:26.64]You get like a bunker back here?
[27:29.51]What the hell is this?
[27:33.23]What the hell was that?
[27:33.87]Was that just on camera?
[27:45.95]That was weird.
[27:46.81]Alright.
[27:48.37]I'm just gonna bank all my money.
[27:57.14]What?
[28:02.40]These are all... I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[28:11.91]Now, don't take me as a bad person or an idiot or something, but... I think there's only like six episodes of The Simpsons that I've ever really actually watched from start to finish.
[28:26.50]I don't get any of this shit.
[28:33.34]I saw the original Treehouse of Horror.
[28:36.46]And then the episode where Maggie's a murderer.
[28:41.91]I don't even know what their last name is.
[28:43.69]There's a lot of references.
[29:00.28]Wait, what do you mean?
[29:03.69]That's a spoiler?
[29:04.63]I thought that was like the thing that they all talk about every episode.
[29:23.10]Wait, the show's like 25 years old!
[29:24.04]The Simpsons is not like a movie that came out last weekend.
[29:55.25]Oh my god, did you just really spoil an episode?
[29:58.88]From 1996?
[29:59.80]I wanna look around.
[30:10.70]Yeah, and guess what guys?
[30:12.14]Ross doesn't date Phoebe!
[30:14.59]That happened in like, 94.
[30:37.77]And that's not even a Simpsons.
[30:39.03]Wait, that's not The Simpsons.
[30:47.60]Oh, I got to talk to Lennie.
[30:55.58]Ross isn't... What if somebody was watching Friends for the first time?
[30:58.82]I mean, Friends has been... I don't know.
[31:03.62]I'm making that up.
[31:04.54]I made everything up.
[31:06.20]Hey, Homer.
[31:06.74]How about a breakfast churro?
[31:07.96]No time.
[31:08.46]Tell me where to find Mr. Smithers.
[31:10.74]I think I saw him at the Quickie Mart.
[31:13.22]More breakfast churros for Lenny.
[31:15.28]I'm going to need a car with a little more junk in the trunk if I'm going to take him out.
[31:19.32]I wonder if Barney still has the Plow King.
[31:28.66]150 coins!
[31:28.84]You're killing me here.
[31:29.52]Barney, can I borrow the Plow King?
[31:30.88]Take what you want, sexy leprechaun!
[31:31.96]Just don't shoot me with that dart gun!
[31:34.10]Whatever.
[31:55.50]Holy shit.
[31:56.52]Alright, that was... F1 is show stats, but I don't have that on the controller, so let's do it.
[32:02.34]Toughness.
[32:02.88]Handling.
[32:03.42]Yeah.
[32:04.84]Purchase it.
[32:06.88]There goes 150 coins.
[32:10.23]Destroy Smithers' car before it gets to the power plant.
[32:16.53]Get into your car.
[32:20.15]Is there a way I can turn the camera?
[32:26.32]I feel like I can't.
[32:27.00]Is it the mouse?
[32:28.28]Alright, we got all these timed missions.
[32:34.55]God damn it.
[32:38.71]This thing handles like shit.
[32:45.05]This is hard to control.
[32:47.00]I want the pink family donut car.
[32:52.73]It was like that when I got here.
[32:54.31]This is a really bad day.
[32:56.55]Mistakes were made.
[32:59.21]Alright, we're going to do the shortcut.
[33:01.00]Oh, I wanted a peanut.
[33:03.04]Oh, that was not a shortcut.
[33:06.96]Or maybe it was.
[33:07.90]Good driving is adequate, but lacks passion.
[33:12.98]Alright, destroy Smithers.
[33:14.23]Well, see you rotten karmic retribution.
[33:18.15]Learn to drive, you dumbass.
[33:22.27]Kinda have to get some speed here.
[33:23.37]Uh... Look at that, right there.
[33:29.44]I wanna go over that.
[33:30.10]I think I just have to ram him.
[33:43.87]Yeah.
[33:44.87]Right under the wall.
[33:49.12]Oh, that was a lot of damage.
[33:51.25]That was a lot of damage.
[33:53.67]Perfect.
[33:54.09]He's dead.
[33:57.81]Yeah, spoiler alert, guys.
[33:59.17]Sorry.
[33:59.47]This is where, like, you kill Smith's best friend Smothers, whatever his name is.
[34:03.82]I'm not afraid to die.
[34:08.72]Nothing lasts forever.
[34:10.62]Why is he still... Uh, why is he not exploding?
[34:19.23]See?
[34:19.51]Spoiler.
[34:20.73]Streamer smothers smothers.
[34:38.42]Do I have a horn?
[34:39.04]Yeah.
[34:39.20]Spoilers.
[34:39.52]Hey, who's that?
[34:41.35]Why does that guy have a money symbol?
[34:44.13]Duff truck.
[34:45.97]Oh, you just sell trucks.
[35:09.73]No, I don't need anything from you right now.
[35:11.05]A lot of random people.
[35:21.25]Jeremiah, I have not watched this part of the game yet.
[35:23.33]Please stop.
[35:24.03]Hey, by the way, Santa... Oh, never mind.
[35:26.29]Hmm.
[35:39.89]This is a blind run, yes.
[35:40.75]Heh.
[36:06.84]Find cardboard tubes and collect the Tamako harvest for Cletus in under 2.30.
[36:13.70]Oh, get into your vehicle.
[36:15.60]This is not the kind of car I think I need for this.
[36:19.36]That's the kind of car that I need for this.
[36:21.06]That one right there.
[36:21.98]Can you drop it off?
[36:33.45]Actually, I'll be alright.
[36:35.71]I snuck through there, I'm good.
[36:38.62]Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad.
[36:49.25]Ooh.
[36:51.19]Alright, not bad.
[36:59.73]Where are you trying to get me to rip around?
[37:01.96]That guy's got low gravity on.
[37:04.62]That guy's flying around through space.
[37:06.52]I had nothing to do with that.
[37:12.95]Through here.
[37:16.27]This thing is so slow.
[37:18.17]Can I break through this?
[37:25.07]Oh my god.
[37:27.29]That's not a shortcut, okay?
[37:29.63]I can't just like break through the doors.
[37:39.74]I see this.
[37:40.90]You get points for this.
[37:50.35]One minute to... That was a school bus.
[37:53.77]Oops.
[37:55.49]Uh, I don't... Is this shortcut?
[37:59.19]Why is that on fire?
[38:02.35]Shortcut!
[38:22.74]Collect the- Oh, I have 25 seconds to get this shit!
[38:28.10]Should I get out of the car?
[38:31.18]I'm getting out!
[38:32.75]OOOH!
[38:51.40]No, that's not it?
[38:52.20]What?
[38:53.18]Oh my god.
[39:08.25]Holy shit.
[39:09.43]I need another car.
[39:11.75]Yeah, I can't do it with this fucking thing.
[39:14.19]How do I just cancel this?
[39:19.83]You can just steal cars?
[39:23.25]You can actually just steal a car.
[39:28.13]What?!
[39:29.68]I... I didn't think this was possible either!
[39:33.52]Wait, what?!
[39:38.70]You can steal cars!
[39:45.30]It's actually just GTA.
[39:51.77]Alright, well, how do I... How do I restart this?
[40:02.20]Homer really is a fucking criminal.
[40:05.68]Well, now I got the school... Oh, I blocked off the road.
[40:08.20]Hold on.
[40:08.62]I'm in... This is worse.
[40:11.48]That I'm in the school bus.
[40:12.40]Actually, the school bus is probably a little bit faster.
[40:17.18]I made it on my own roadblock.
[40:22.78]I think I can still get it.
[40:23.56]I think I'll be alright.
[40:31.36]Don't get out of the car.
[40:33.34]As long as I get back there within two minutes.
[40:36.05]That's what happens when you look at the chat for no reason.
[40:39.31]Alright, give me a better car.
[40:44.33]I'm gonna restart it with a better car.
[40:54.18]Come here.
[40:55.26]Telephone.
[41:00.09]Uh, damage, 4% given.
[41:01.83]Thank you.
[41:02.31]Alright, this is my real car.
[41:07.60]Alright.

[41:15.82]Homer Simpson did his own mocap for this game.
[41:21.24]Really?
[41:22.32]That's interesting.
[41:28.89]That is pretty interesting.
[41:36.49]Alright, nice and easy.
[41:41.26]Oh, come on.
[41:42.00]What the hell?
[41:42.52]I had to go over that lip?
[41:55.56]Back there I'll get it As long as I get back there with about a minute left
[42:20.93]I love how I looked over at chat, and the first thing I see is, stop looking at chat.
[42:26.49]This is the right way, I remember I went through this.
[42:29.19]Alright, now I gotta get this right.
[42:34.47]Don't read this!
[42:40.45]Oh my god!
[42:43.72]I can't help myself!
[42:46.00]I didn't even get the bonus!

[43:05.56]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[43:08.02]Here are the cops.
[43:09.92]That show-off.
[43:18.67]Too much heat, apparently.
[43:25.16]27 seconds.
[43:26.04]I'll make it.
[43:26.58]I'm almost there.
[43:28.00]Alright, I brought it back.

[44:10.44]Does Bart Simpson drive in this game?
[44:12.72]No, they wouldn't do that, right?
[44:19.01]Bart Simpson drives in this game.
[44:29.49]Okay, let's try that.
[44:30.94]Let's try the new car.
[44:34.96]Wow, I need a disco nap.
[44:38.46]Pickup truck.
[44:40.96]Toughness, handling, speed, acceleration.
[44:45.82]This thing sucks.
[44:49.42]This is just a shitty plow king.
[44:50.84]Wait.
[44:53.50]He's gonna... I'm not driving.
[44:54.30]Wait.
[44:55.08]I'm him now.
[45:19.07]That's kind of cool.
[45:25.43]Look at that 180 degree neck turn.
[45:34.04]Just put some butter on the wound.
[45:36.04]It'll be fine.
[45:37.54]Yeah, I'm just hitchhiking right now.
[45:39.00]That's really cool.
[45:46.56]Alright, let me get this this time.
[45:49.67]Got it.
[45:50.59]That was better than the movie box!
[45:53.71]Power, I still have to turn in this power plant mission.
[46:00.03]That was easy as pie.
[46:02.25]Wait, that was supposed to be a race?
[46:04.01]It's over easy.
[46:07.11]Am I, are cars allowed in here?
[46:09.41]Vengeance will be mine.
[46:10.83]What the fuck?
[46:11.65]Just a few more.
[46:12.77]Holy shit.
[46:13.70]Okay, this is freaking me out.
[46:15.16]Hold on.
[46:16.54]You got real pretty acceleration.
[46:31.69]I need to get out of this car.
[46:33.41]Alright.
[46:33.91]Homer's workstation.
[46:36.39]Thanks for the ride.
[46:37.15]Almost got... yeah.
[46:52.82]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:53.64]What's this button do?
[46:56.00]Sneak right... Well, now you got me all fucked up because this is... This probably sounds like a secret chest up here or something.
[47:15.97]Yeah, it ain't gonna fuck me up.
[47:25.96]All that for, what, one coin?
[47:28.45]Oops.
[47:37.15]Hey, I gotta change that button.
[47:38.33]Jump can't be B. Uh, I mean run can't be B.
[47:45.73]Because I have to, like, turn my hand around and do B and A to jump.
[47:48.75]I gotta change that to... What the hell?
[47:50.93]X, maybe?
[47:51.93]B, attack?
[47:53.09]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[48:00.70]Yeah, attack would be... Should be B. Jump should be A. Sprint should be X. Get in is Y. Okay, that's better.
[48:10.74]Plug in a controller.
[48:11.44]That's what I'm playing with.
[48:13.16]I'm playing with a controller right now.
[48:16.57]Yeah, that feels better.
[48:17.99]That feels more correct.
[48:22.33]Man, I keep forgetting about the double jump.
[48:24.17]It's alright.
[48:24.87]Alright, here we go.
[48:26.83]Wait, I want to look around Homer's station.
[48:28.40]Am I breathing in these fumes and going crazy?
[48:33.92]I don't get it.
[48:47.35]Destroy all the power couplings before time runs out.
[48:50.09]What?
[48:53.59]What is this?
[48:54.81]Hold on.
[48:55.57]I... I just killed somebody.
[49:11.03]Destroy all the...
[49:15.92]No, this is gonna suck absolute ass.
[49:17.66]This is gonna be real bad, but no, I'll get it.
[49:19.24]Haha!
[49:21.37]Stupid like a fox!
[49:40.05]What does stupid like a fox mean?
[49:42.55]You hear how low that was?
[49:43.90]Stupid like a fox.
[49:48.70]No, I got it.
[49:50.58]I'm good.
[49:52.46]I got stuck on that.
[49:53.48]I got fucking clipped on that.
[49:55.65]Sorry, I got a ton of time.
[50:06.37]It's not like anyone likes these things.
[50:13.80]Alright, I got it.
[50:20.06]Whoa.
[50:21.46]Whoa, where are we going?
[50:22.74]Buzzkill!
[50:25.96]On the blades?
[50:27.14]Or over the railing?
[50:33.67]Uh.
[50:36.67]Just walk on the blade?
[50:37.61]Oh.
[50:48.97]Now I have to get that though.
[50:50.13]That was a little bit... a little bit hard to do.
[50:52.27]I think I'll get it.
[50:52.69]I'll get it... I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[51:11.00]Jump fro- ugh! Jump from the blades.
[51:18.96]Yeah, maybe I can make it like this.
[51:29.97]Ouch!
[51:30.52]My bikini zone's chafing!
[51:32.42]Try it one more time.
[51:34.04]What's this do?
[51:39.04]Woohoo!
[51:40.06]I love senselessly pushing things!
[51:47.37]Just go.
[51:47.97]I want to just get the thing.
[51:50.47]Alright, when you were playing Simpsons Hit and Run, and you saw like a little secret here, and it was kind of tricky to jump to get it, did you give up after two times?
[52:07.29]See?
[52:07.79]Like, why would I do that?
[52:09.79]I got it.
[52:22.71]Finally, I can get some sleep.
[52:25.76]Mindless drones, return to your ugly families.
[52:29.02]I'm king of the world!
[52:33.38]Got it.
[52:35.64]Drive to The Simpsons house.
[52:36.92]Wait, is there anything?
[52:37.44]Can I look at stuff in the office?
[52:44.80]Is it a bug farm?
[52:50.41]I can't interact with anything else in Homer's office.
[52:53.77]There's no fall damage.
[52:54.85]No, not in hit and run.
[52:56.45]No, now I'm in trouble.
[52:58.41]Okay, I see.
[52:59.67]Do I have to drive up this?
[53:24.18]I can't drive up this.
[53:28.42]Had to get some momentum.
[53:34.04]263?
[53:34.16]That's not bad.
[53:38.58]Alright, back to the house.
[53:44.23]To our safety, we're seven days since the last accident.
[53:46.99]Actually, none.
[53:49.11]Considering that I just melted somebody in there.
[54:00.15]Watch that meter.
[54:01.20]Yeah, I do need to keep my eye on the meter, you're right.
[54:08.70]That's the you're in trouble meter.
[54:20.02]I want it, give it to me.
[54:25.47]There is a card back here.
[54:39.39]So what do these do?
[54:40.88]Mr. Sparklebox.
[54:44.58]There's also something to do here.
[54:45.48]Yeah, there's a lot of like random shit to do.
[54:52.20]Get them all.
[54:53.72]Get all the cards.
[54:58.54]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[55:04.21]It's a pointless collectible?
[55:06.39]Didn't he say he could sell them?
[55:15.30]I want to get rid of this car.
[55:20.50]Give me a phone.
[55:22.37]I want my other car back.
[55:23.31]If I'm going to do a race, I need to have my other car.
[55:25.35]Alright, give it back to me.
[55:36.41]Kill Milhouse.
[55:37.71]You can't kill anybody in this game.
[55:40.21]Why would I do that?
[55:45.89]Alright, let's do it.
[55:47.13]Reach the finish line before time runs out.
[55:50.57]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[55:51.31]Five laps.
[56:10.04]Oh, they'd really like to throw these at you.
[56:11.40]This is a drift map.
[56:17.34]Am I actually gonna be able to do five laps here?
[56:28.36]Maybe, but I don't know.
[56:29.65]That's gonna be close.
[56:31.19]There can't be any mistakes.
[56:46.35]I'm actually, I'm so mad right now.
[56:49.08]I'm actually fucking angry.
[56:50.50]Oh, slow down.
[56:51.38]Easy, Jeremy.
[56:51.98]What the fuck was that?
[56:52.90]I went from like a zero to a fucking thousand.
[57:04.27]I can just break the damn tree.
[57:09.05]It was going so well, too.
[57:10.13]I still get it.
[57:17.81]The scales just tipped.
[57:18.81]Somebody put like four weights on the other side.
[57:20.75]I almost didn't hit it.
[57:26.69]So what do I get for that?
[57:28.69]Nothing?
[57:46.85]Apparently nothing.
[57:50.21]That's what Homer wanted to do all season four, right?
[58:03.84]Spoiler.
[58:04.42]Oh, please.
[58:06.45]Don't even.
[58:07.97]That's not a spoiler.
[58:09.61]There's no such thing as a spoiler.
[58:11.03]I mean, there is, but not in this context.
[58:16.64]Wait, Crusty the Crab.
[58:22.02]Nice.
[58:24.47]Complete all three races.
[58:27.61]Well, when they pop up, I'll do them.
[58:40.54]Homer wasn't introduced until Season 6.
[58:46.70]Do I get to, can I drive around with Grandpa?
[59:08.31]Spying on our women's dressing rooms, bathrooms, and locker rooms is unforgivable.
[59:13.71]I think I speak for all Springfielders when I say, where is the sexy footage?
[59:19.59]In other unexplained news, strange black vans have been appearing all over town.
[59:26.18]Marge, that black van is spying on us.
[59:29.74]Oh, homie, you're so sexy when you're paranoid.
[59:36.94]What?
[59:38.20]Uh, investigate and follow the black van.
[59:39.94]Don't let it get away.
[59:46.81]That was comedy, apparently.
[59:52.21]Follow the black van.
[59:55.72]Let's go!
[59:59.83]I'm assuming that's the meter at the top is don't fill that otherwise mission failed Fucking escort mission they put these in this goddamn game Fill it why would I fill it?
[60:31.80]Isn't that the meter that is... Hey, don't get that close.
[60:35.34]You're too close, Homer.
[60:39.36]I know what that meter is.
[60:40.30]I've played a GTA game before. ...
[61:00.50]Alright, school bus, what are you doing?
[61:09.83]No, I'm not gonna get baited from chat for the 4000th time.
[61:14.99]To fill the meter, get up real close, and have it be like, DON'T!
[61:42.42]Nuclear power plant.
[61:46.52]Heading into the power plant.
[62:01.30]What are you doing in here, spy van?
[62:06.10]Did that just drive off the edge?
[62:10.39]No, okay, alright, alright.
[62:13.11]Watch it, buddy!
[62:14.47]Please don't shoot!
[62:19.73]That does it, I'm moving to Shelbyville.
[62:21.96]This is the worst town in America.
[62:25.48]No!
[62:25.64]Too close, too close, too close.
[62:29.90]Does that hurt me?
[62:49.93]Shit!
[62:55.05]No!
[62:55.61]Wait, wait!
[62:56.21]I hit the car stuck!
[63:01.10]Wait!
[63:01.94]Give me a car!
[63:02.61]Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus!
[63:04.93]What?
[63:05.09]We did it.
[63:35.81]Okay, I did it.
[63:36.79]I tailed him for long enough so that I could get the information.
[63:54.97]Get rocket ro- wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, rocket car.
[63:57.31]Why is everybody freaking out?
[63:58.39]Rocket car, rocket car.
[64:02.27]Get rocket car.
[64:04.54]You want me to get this?
[64:05.96]Okay.
[64:06.86]Is this a secret?
[64:12.66]I love to sit.
[64:14.28]How does this work?
[64:16.52]Mistakes were made.
[64:18.94]Do I get this forever now?
[64:22.08]Watch it.
[64:22.74]I almost spilled my sundae.
[64:24.12]This thing's already gonna explode.
[64:29.24]Oh, I forgot my mission.
[64:35.87]Oh, that just startled me.
[64:42.52]That thing sucks.
[64:45.06]This is really fast.
[64:47.96]Do the... Oh, I should have had the rocket car for this, right?
[64:50.62]Street is not dead.
[64:51.78]What?
[65:06.70]Play all laps and finish the race in first place.
[65:08.60]Don't destroy the vehicle.
[65:12.22]Oh no, I do have the car.
[65:14.51]How do I do this without blowing up the car?
[65:16.77]This is not going to happen.
[65:22.09]Alright, here's my plan.
[65:27.29]My plan is to be very careful and then go punch it as hard as I can on the last lap.
[65:35.14]I'm just gonna hold down right trigger.
[65:37.30]Holy shit, they're so, they're so dumb.
[65:43.45]Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[65:45.71]I'm gonna punch it.
[65:46.41]He doesn't matter.
[65:47.09]He can toad the fuck out of me if he wants.
[65:48.65]Wait, hold on.
[65:57.94]No, I don't, I can't do that.
[66:18.53]This is not gonna work.
[66:19.91]It's not gonna work with this thing.
[66:31.64]I need another car.
[66:36.32]There's no way I can do it in that.
[66:38.32]No, no.
[66:38.98]Don't retry the mission.
[66:40.38]Give me a new car.
[66:47.81]I'll do it again.
[66:49.95]There he is.
[66:50.31]It's Krusty.
[66:59.53]Oh, that was brutal.
[67:01.05]That was brutal.
[67:01.73]Now I'm ready.
[67:02.97]I was about to win?
[67:15.91]Was I though?
[67:16.61]Hold on.
[67:17.15]There's a button to press.
[67:17.83]Who lives here?
[67:18.45]Cool.
[67:18.65]Secret!
[67:18.87]Watch this!
[67:45.69]Nice.
[67:46.13]There we go!
[67:46.77]Alright, I'm ready.
[67:47.33]I mean, it still starts in 3, 2, 1 anyways, so why does that matter?
[67:55.99]Alright, I'll get it.
[68:13.47]Just gotta stay in first place, go around the lap here.
[68:19.76]Alright, I got it.
[68:25.88]Just drive normal, you don't have to do any crazy moves.
[68:34.45]This is race number two out of three, right?
[68:37.15]And then once I do race three, I get the secret costume.
[68:44.17]Alright.
[68:51.58]You get a car.
[68:52.26]Ooh, okay.
[68:53.92]This guy's gonna run up my ass, though.
[68:55.12]I gotta punch it.
[69:04.11]He's right up my ass.
[69:06.27]He did crash into the wall.
[69:09.07]He's gonna say that a thousand more times.
[69:11.99]He's gonna say that so many more times.
[69:36.70]This is it.
[69:41.16]Last wraparound.
[69:43.90]Ooh, smooth.
[69:46.75]Very smooth.
[69:56.59]Don't lose it here, come on.
[69:59.91]Did it not know what place I was just in?
[70:01.41]This is terrible.
[70:02.83]I'm gonna drown my sorrows at the golden banana.
[70:06.57]I am so smart!
[70:08.39]I am so smart!
[70:10.21]S-M-R-T!
[70:11.29]I mean, S-M-A-R-T!
[70:16.11]How did you guys know that?
[70:17.63]You guys have played this game before?
[70:21.90]I'm surprised at how many people have actually played this game.
[70:26.02]That's very surprising to me.
[70:30.81]It's from the TV show?
[70:31.69]Yeah, but how did you know it was gonna be right there?
[70:39.36]I just want to look around.
[70:45.52]Okay, I gotta take a car up here.
[70:49.36]Because I'm gonna blast through that.
[70:50.60]Alright, give me my car.
[70:53.36]How do I get up there?
[70:54.18]How do I get up here?
[70:56.24]Okay, I gotta go around there.
[70:57.55]Why is everybody part of the power plant?
[71:07.59]They just walk around?
[71:14.42]Should I be in one of those suits?
[71:19.92]Oh, this guy's driving the car!
[71:22.89]I didn't steal the car.
[71:30.53]Why?
[71:31.57]Okay, hold on, I'll get it.
[71:48.18]God damn it.
[71:55.62]I gotta go back further.
[71:56.46]I'm gonna start from over here.
[72:04.93]Holy fuck, look at that!
[72:06.19]Whoa!
[72:06.43]Hold on, I'll get that later.
[72:07.59]USA!
[72:08.37]USA!
[72:19.88]Ow!
[72:20.38]My neck!
[72:24.02]I just, like, overshot the hell out of him.
[72:26.14]I need to get the, uh, the help.
[72:27.82]I wish I had a dog with a saddle.
[72:30.89]My knee!
[72:32.33]Did that guy just... Did I... That guy dead?
[72:44.18]Well, it's about time.
[72:48.67]I might be able to get out of this.
[72:51.55]I gotta go off the right way though.
[73:00.12]No!
[73:00.50]Why did I... I'm a lean mean speed thingy!
[73:16.90]I am evil Homer I am evil Homer I died I died I did it didn't I do it that was offshoot I need the rocket car but it's an invisible wall there's nothing up there oh watch it well let's do a mission
[73:48.41]That was a jump.
[73:51.54]How would you break that one?
[73:52.70]Other side?
[73:55.72]Alright, talk to Marge.
[74:00.49]But first, hold on, wait.
[74:05.34]I love that sound.
[74:06.72]That coin collection sound is perfect.
[74:08.50]Uh-oh.
[74:09.14]Hit the delivery truck and collect the bone storm games before time runs out.
[74:13.27]Oh, it's Marge.
[74:36.25]Hit the delivery truck and collect 10 copies.
[74:38.43]Well, that's the truck.
[74:41.31]So you can... Marge, you sure do care about children.
[74:52.30]You're running over a lot of them.
[74:55.42]You really just have to sit right here and bump it a couple times.
[75:05.95]That hitbox is not that big, apparently.
[75:15.24]Just wait for it to spawn.
[75:22.69]Easing.
[75:23.11]It's not that hard.
[75:26.07]You just have to be patient.
[75:29.57]Just tap it.
[75:32.70]Break.
[75:34.91]That wasn't enough.
[75:38.29]I'm not sure how.
[75:46.53]Last one.
[75:47.07]Do I have to do something else?
[75:48.21]There's always like a part two in this game, it seems like.
[75:50.54]No.
[75:51.42]Sell the copies to G2A.
[75:54.56]No, that's topical.
[76:04.41]Homer.
[76:04.73]What happened?
[76:05.33]Oh.
[76:05.45]This is what happened to my Amazon package.
[76:09.43]Drive to the power plant.
[76:10.42]Not yet.
[76:11.24]Where's the other race?
[76:34.99]Give me the phone.
[76:37.70]I want to explore around.
[76:38.74]I don't want to just blow through.
[76:39.80]Blow through the game?
[76:47.26]No!
[76:47.88]Why would I do that?
[76:57.54]I don't want to blow through the game.
[77:00.54]Alright.
[77:04.80]What's this?
[77:05.20]I want to go in people's backyards and... I want to find the other race.
[77:14.09]Because there's another car I can get, right?
[77:19.66]I did not explore...
[77:22.61]And that's why you got to take a minute sometimes.
[77:24.83]Because there is a collectible Pokémon card up there.
[77:28.31]How do I get that?
[77:30.21]There's a huge jump.
[77:32.13]Alright.
[77:32.59]Just wait.
[77:33.57]Relax.
[77:41.68]That didn't really do anything.
[77:53.66]Not going fast enough, or was it, was that... I missed the sign.
[77:59.78]I gotta go through the sign.
[78:01.14]Aye.
[78:02.36]Okay, hold on, I'll get it.
[78:03.18]Let me line it up.
[78:07.69]Where's the sign?
[78:08.25]Alright, it's right... right there.
[78:12.79]Okay.
[78:17.07]I am Excellente!
[78:25.15]It doesn't do anything!
[78:26.55]It doesn't do anything!
[78:32.39]So let me just platform.
[78:38.09]Let me look around for a place to jump.
[78:41.28]There's some stuff over here.
[78:54.31]From here to here?
[78:55.05]Come on, camera.
[78:57.53]Turn around.
[79:13.30]Made it.
[79:13.54]Alright.
[79:14.92]Now what?
[79:16.62]Is that it?
[79:23.29]Ooh, don't fall off.
[79:25.33]That's it.
[79:32.56]You're on the wrong roof.
[79:37.42]Oh, the quickie mart's over there.
[79:54.03]So now, can I make this jump?
[80:00.49]Holy fuck, I didn't even see it!
[80:02.17]Very nice.
[80:18.26]Oh, look at these pog tramps.
[80:19.84]Where am I?
[80:22.15]Oh.
[80:22.87]Well, got it.
[80:28.45]Does this do anything?
[80:36.25]Don't do that.
[80:36.65]Wait, there's another gas.
[80:40.97]Bouncy, bouncy!
[80:44.65]I gotta spend some money.
[80:45.51]Oh, I'm going to the donut boy, right?
[80:48.63]Donut guy?
[80:48.91]I jumped it.
[80:49.73]Oh, shit.
[80:50.37]Can I get on his head?
[81:15.44]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[81:18.60]I could just hang out here.
[81:24.61]Itchy and scratchy over there.
[81:31.23]You won the game.
[81:33.71]Sometimes.
[81:37.25]ADHD stream.
[81:44.15]Well, I wanted to take a look around for a second to get some money and... Actually, you know, I want to buy that costume.
[81:53.18]I have money, I'm buying it.
[82:15.82]What do you have that is high in both fat and alcohol content?
[82:20.28]I'm so glad you came.
[82:21.64]If I don't increase profits, I'll have to send you to the Krusty Burger.
[82:27.30]I just broke his machine.
[82:31.79]Oh, I just ruined it.
[82:33.53]Did I just get arrested?
[82:36.95]Did I just steal a bunch of money from a fucking ATM?
[82:44.67]What is that?
[82:45.31]Wait, hold on.
[82:45.89]I thought I could play it.
[82:49.06]I just skipped the cutscene because I thought I was playing the game.
[83:08.99]Restart the whole... There we go, there we go, here we go, here we go.
[83:11.27]Let's watch it.
[83:20.13]Holy shit.
[83:24.70]Was this game rated?
[83:25.42]Can I take the duff truck?
[83:33.10]No.
[83:36.30]Right, I want that.
[83:43.78]Interesting platforming coming right up.
[83:50.61]There's another one of these.
[83:51.37]Ooh, from here to there?
[83:52.37]I think I can make it from here over there.
[83:54.19]This thing gives so much money.
[84:01.65]Oops.
[84:03.35]Okay.
[84:06.94]No, you can do that.
[84:07.92]It's fine.
[84:08.20]It doesn't hurt you.
[84:14.50]Alright.
[84:17.00]Let's go.
[84:18.26]Let's move on.
[84:23.75]Holy fuck, Homer is strong.
[84:30.81]This car is fast.
[84:39.12]This is just screaming by.
[84:43.62]Do the final race.
[84:50.99]Where is it?
[84:54.55]I haven't seen it pop up on the minimap.
[84:56.60]I have to go to the church.
[85:02.64]Whoops.
[85:02.92]We're good.
[85:03.70]It's on two wheels.
[85:26.55]I keep going that way.
[85:27.37]I have not driven down this road once.
[85:30.61]Did that one.
[85:31.19]I don't really know where the church is.
[85:38.92]I'll have to stumble upon it after this mission.
[85:41.08]Come on!
[85:49.74]Oh, that's so unfortunate.
[86:01.95]Carl.
[86:07.97]Hi, Carl!
[86:09.05]Hey, Homer.
[86:09.89]You look like you're having one of your trademark adventures.
[86:12.79]Danger!
[86:13.85]Mr. Burns!
[86:14.83]Mini-cameras!
[86:15.93]Black Vans!
[86:16.83]Well, good thing I'm drunk.
[86:18.54]Stupid drunk.
[86:19.78]Oh, no!
[86:20.28]He's going to warn Burns!
[86:21.94]I can't believe I'm racing the same guy twice in one day!
[86:24.62]This is the last mission of the game?
[86:27.08]No, it is not.
[86:28.56]Beat Smithers to Mr. Burns' mansion.
[86:30.75]It's crashing time!
[86:40.88]Sorry!
[86:49.68]I like the car, though.
[86:50.50]It's got the perfect handling, perfect safety features.
[86:57.50]Ooh, almost flipped the whole thing.
[87:04.78]He used a cheat code!
[87:09.55]Oh, he cheated too!
[87:10.43]Fuck, I didn't know they do the cheats.
[87:26.57]Move out of the way!
[87:27.85]Just gotta stay in front of him.
[87:31.33]He's gonna get stuck right there.
[87:33.21]Good.
[87:34.22]Perfect.
[87:36.99]There's not enough room on the road for both of us.
[87:38.59]Should I go straight through?
[87:40.41]Straight through?
[87:42.59]Yup.
[87:43.17]He had the same- Oh, I just fucked him up so bad.
[87:49.93]I just ruined everything for you.
[87:54.76]Don't pass me.
[88:09.44]I don't know where to go.
[88:10.52]I don't watch this TV show.
[88:13.06]I don't.
[88:13.94]Oh, I don't watch this show.
[88:15.98]I would have known.
[88:16.68]You stupid asshole.
[88:22.21]Eat my dust, dust eater.
[88:32.31]Homer hates losing.
[88:34.15]Homer smash.
[88:42.31]Oh, come on!
[88:42.67]I had it too.
[88:47.54]Right at the end, I cut him off.
[89:11.65]This car, just look at this car.
[89:15.02]What a piece of crap this car is.
[89:17.56]What a piece of crap.
[89:18.76]This didn't make it.
[89:23.54]Well, I am destroying him right now.
[89:25.34]What is he doing?
[89:26.02]Oh, now I have a wedgie.
[89:32.19]And I didn't even go through the... Oh, I just cracked my neck like in 50 places.
[89:37.21]Just trying to cut corners.
[89:39.19]How many school buses are here?
[90:02.25]He just hit that, good.
[90:06.79]I've got itchy, my whole body's itchy.
[90:11.27]Oh my God, my whole fucking body is itching.
[90:13.19]That just helped him, unbelievable.
[90:35.99]That same motherfucker right there.
[90:37.59]It was the same guy.
[90:39.53]It was the same guy.
[90:40.79]I still got it.
[90:41.53]I still got it.
[90:43.43]Where am I going?
[90:44.68]Holy shit.
[91:00.64]As soon as I'm done scratching myself, you're history.
[91:06.01]I beat him.
[91:08.19]Did I win?
[91:10.47]I won.
[91:18.34]Team Montgomery Burns, I know you're guilty.
[91:20.74]You're accused.
[91:22.58]Sir?
[91:23.10]Fine, I admit it.
[91:24.06]I had Amelia Earhart's plane shot down.
[91:26.60]That hussy was getting too big for her jodhpurs.
[91:29.11]No, you're spying on Spring.
[91:32.51]Final cutscene of the game.
[91:33.83]First try, itty.
[91:34.39]I thought I just failed the mission.
[92:01.11]My heart just sank into my stomach.
[92:08.03]Did I beat it?
[92:32.49]No, I didn't.
[92:35.19]Talk to... Oh, now I get to play as Bart.
[92:46.28]This is a different place.
[92:48.28]This is like 20 years in the future.
[92:49.94]She made it.
[92:57.08]Ooh, what's this?
[92:58.46]I wanna look around.
[92:59.26]Avoid Principal Skinner, drive to the try and save before time runs out.
[93:01.65]I guess I'm going into the rocket car.
[93:26.92]And this is a, like, seven-year-old driving a car.
[93:36.77]Don't let him... Ah, this is... This is a grown man trying to drive into a kid in a go-kart.
[94:06.99]Did I just avoid him for a minute?
[94:10.65]I'm doing a pretty good job avoiding.
[94:12.03]Got it.
[94:14.23]The Bartman!
[94:14.93]Empty the bar.
[94:15.61]What do you mean, empty the bar?
[94:38.17]Wait, free stuff.
[94:39.23]The money carries over to the next land.
[94:40.81]Drive to Herman's.
[95:09.43]I don't wanna get in the thing.
[95:18.16]Oh!
[95:19.76]Oh, God.
[95:21.06]Okay, I thought I just did that.
[95:22.52]I thought I just kicked him into it and blew it up.
[95:31.93]Hey!
[95:32.69]What do you got for me?
[95:34.35]It's me, Bart!
[95:36.43]That was a gag.
[95:37.13]A lot of self-referential video game.
[95:38.35]Video games are bad referentials.
[95:39.41]Collect fireworks from around Springfield before time runs out.
[95:43.07]I only have 60 seconds to do this.
[96:07.51]That's not a way to turn.
[96:21.94]These people are jumping.
[96:22.90]They're just jumping into the... I don't know.
[96:25.00]I'm not doing that.
[96:25.84]They are.
[96:26.16]I just ran over two people's heads.
[96:34.23]This is the car wash.
[96:35.17]No, don't tell me to go that way.
[96:37.03]It's right here.
[96:37.63]Oh, hey, Otto.
[96:44.30]One box of your finest quality Chinese frog launchers, please.
[96:47.74]Here you go.
[96:48.42]Two kilos of Chinese sky candy.
[96:50.84]They'll blow you away.
[96:54.58]Alright, got it.
[96:55.96]Enter modes.
[96:56.56]Do I have to... Am I going to prank call them?
[97:04.35]Can I interact?
[97:04.85]With any of this stuff?
[97:11.05]I can't jump.
[97:13.11]Yeah, I'm gonna- Can I call him?
[97:15.10]That's the joke, right?
[97:19.52]Drink at the bar as Bart.
[97:21.64]Sorry, Bart.
[97:22.50]I can't serve booze to a miner.
[97:24.00]It ain't right.
[97:24.64]I'm hearing about fireworks.
[97:25.90]Oh, hell yeah.
[97:26.75]Heh.
[97:32.57]I won!
[97:33.13]What did I get?
[97:39.45]One coin.
[97:48.95]Do it again.
[97:58.58]That was the coolest thing I've seen anybody do in the game.
[98:00.95]He just did a full backflip.
[98:02.47]No hands.
[98:19.02]Cold fish.
[98:20.56]One more.
[98:23.52]Did it again!
[98:24.02]I'm pretty good at this.
[98:29.03]Why is there a mirror world?
[98:31.77]Yeah, that is strange.
[98:32.53]That's something to do with how the game is being rendered.
[98:35.05]I don't know why it's doing that.
[98:42.60]Let's go!
[98:48.50]Drive to the Springfield Town Hall.
[98:52.66]You got it, Bart.
[98:58.31]Wait, not yet.
[98:59.89]What's this?
[99:11.88]It's a reference that I don't get.
[99:16.79]It's a reference.
[99:20.71]That was anticlimactic.
[99:21.59]I should have drove through that.
[99:25.80]Oh my god.
[99:26.38]There's a fucking timer up there.
[99:31.26]Goddammit.
[99:40.10]Not a joke?
[99:40.76]No.
[99:41.42]No, it wasn't.
[99:42.22]I wasn't even paying any attention to it.
[99:49.02]I just, for some reason, just my brain turned off the fact that the top corner of the screen was a timer.
[99:54.47]And that every single mission is timed.
[100:07.01]I'm going to do the whole thing again.
[100:09.01]God damn it.
[100:18.29]Boomer memory.
[100:20.97]No, no, no.
[100:22.85]Wait, Moe's is right next to it.
[100:28.89]Time to rock!
[100:39.71]Fireworks, yeah!
[100:44.85]Talk to him.
[100:47.01]Sorry, bot.
[100:53.57]Alright.
[100:54.41]I think my- you know what it was?
[100:55.73]It was the fact that the timer's not there now.
[100:57.35]The timer's not there.
[100:59.60]You know what I mean?
[101:00.70]The timer is not here, I didn't pay attention, and now it is.
[101:05.44]So, that's why.
[101:06.32]And I want to look at the city.
[101:30.97]Alright.
[101:31.75]Got it.
[101:33.97]No timer, right?
[101:34.69]I can do this?
[101:46.94]Here are your fireworks.
[101:47.90]Here you go, kid dude.
[101:51.97]Now don't blow your hand off.
[101:53.93]Or do.
[101:54.61]What do I care?
[102:01.53]He's still going.
[102:07.82]Still timed.
[102:08.62]Don't make... Don't let me forget that.
[102:10.22]Because I will get out of this car and just start pressing buttons on stuff.
[102:28.63]Don't explode.
[102:29.81]I don't want to do this whole fucking thing again.
[102:43.10]Ralph, word in the hood is that you got access to your old man's fireworks stash.
[102:46.34]Fireworks make my ears yell.
[102:48.56]Here's some gumdrops.
[102:49.66]Now make with the works.
[102:50.76]My daddy's going to put you in jail.
[102:53.30]Bye.
[102:53.46]That's terrifying.
[102:54.34]That's a terrifying Ralph.
[102:57.02]Alright, hold on a minute.
[102:59.08]I need a new car.
[103:01.06]Oh, fuck.
[103:01.94]This is gonna explode.
[103:03.12]My car's gonna explode.
[103:04.56]Can I steal a car as a fart?
[103:21.65]Am I gonna... is he... I don't understand what the bar is for.
[103:30.11]This is saying don't go this way.
[103:31.31]Is this the end of the game?
[103:32.03]No, it's not an invisible wall.
[103:34.23]Okay.
[103:34.43]I was just making sure that was an invisible wall.
[103:43.98]Alright, I got it.
[103:49.12]Drive to the go-go-plex.
[103:59.27]Incoming great song.
[104:00.71]Can I just plow through this?
[104:12.42]No, I have to go all the way around.
[104:15.25]Wait, where's the... That guy is driving in the wrong place.
[104:46.71]Too many detours.
[104:50.63]Is the passenger still in the taxi?
[104:52.07]Yeah, that's the one driving the taxi.
[104:53.83]That's how they can get away with this.
[105:01.05]Alright, comic book guy, what do you got?
[105:04.53]Race to the nerd.
[105:06.27]Race the nerd to the Java server.
[105:40.49]How do I, how am I racing the nerd when I'm in the nerd's car?
[105:50.48]The other nerd.
[105:56.11]There's two nerds.
[105:59.47]Well, this nerd's car sucks.
[106:07.66]Glancing blow.
[106:09.22]Oh man, this sucks.
[106:10.66]Glancing blow.
[106:12.93]I spilled my squishy.
[106:14.89]We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[106:20.41]Bart Simpson at your service.
[106:24.72]Work speed.
[106:26.22]Oh, bull plop.
[106:30.88]Aw, loser.
[106:33.46]Alright, let's power through it.
[106:39.09]You can drive through trees.
[106:39.93]This is not... Man, this sucks.
[106:43.92]Unbelievable.
[106:44.50]Well, that just got a little more rare.
[107:01.31]That was totally awesome!
[107:03.65]Engage!
[107:04.77]I think you could have avoided...
[107:08.27]What was I supposed to do after that total failure at the beginning?
[107:26.40]Oh, that lady got fucking destroyed.
[107:34.49]We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[107:41.77]What the fuck was that?
[107:42.85]Woo, nice one.
[107:48.59]I blame Noah.
[107:49.93]Whoa, wicked.
[107:52.71]Lucky break.
[107:53.11]God.
[107:53.23]Furry animals.
[108:23.12]Wait, can I take his car?
[108:24.96]It's gone.
[108:25.64]Okay.
[108:30.04]So there's family sedan, fire truck limo, World War II vehicle, surveillance van, duff truck, electaurus.
[108:44.11]Speed, acceleration, toughness.
[108:48.69]This is the best thing.
[108:59.72]Alright, give me that.
[109:06.38]Alright.
[109:08.15]Good old Bart.
[109:10.81]Who doesn't like Bart, you know?
[109:13.31]There's a race right here.
[109:19.87]Let's do it.
[109:22.65]I don't... You don't like Bart?
[109:26.22]Hi, Mr. Lisa.
[109:27.31]If you win, the man ladies will give you a car.
[109:30.25]Bring it.
[109:32.71]Pass all checkpoints and cross the finish line first.
[109:35.51]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[109:37.41]Five, five, five, four.
[109:39.82]I mean, that was cute.
[109:43.74]That was cute.
[109:46.88]Why is there a taxi?
[109:49.36]Don't have a cow, man.
[109:52.85]Oh boy.
[109:53.39]I'm sure I'm not driving against and racing against ghosts of my own driving.
[110:01.01]I'm just facing my own ghosts.
[110:06.97]This guy's gonna be hard to pass.
[110:18.50]We going on the highway?
[110:20.70]Yes, we are.
[110:26.43]Just pass him.
[110:27.86]No, he got to do the cool thing, and I didn't.
[110:38.52]Oh, did not expect that.
[110:39.42]It's over.
[110:39.80]I lost.
[110:51.14]I need a better car, probably.
[110:52.54]Yeah.
[110:53.76]Maybe, if I can get up there real quick.
[110:56.94]If you ain't fast, you're last.
[111:12.60]Yeah, that's true.
[111:17.74]Does this count if I don't... It does, okay.
[111:19.50]You don't have to... I don't have to touch them.
[111:21.12]I don't have to touch those.
[111:22.50]I just have to go... Okay.
[111:25.82]That changes everything.
[111:28.71]I thought I actually had to go near that circle.
[111:30.91]No, you ain't gonna fuck that up.
[111:45.03]I'm in front now.
[111:47.57]Your car's faster than mine.
[111:48.72]Sorry.
[111:49.44]That's not fair.
[111:50.62]Not fair.
[111:55.00]Just like in NASCAR, I'm going to stay on the inside.
[112:07.11]How dare you!
[112:08.59]How dare you!
[112:10.47]Do that to me at the very end.
[112:12.31]Oh.
[112:15.15]Oh, I had it too.
[112:16.94]I just...
[112:20.74]Unbelievable!
[112:21.84]That was so stupid.
[112:29.46]How fuckin'... come on.
[112:35.14]That was bullshit too.
[112:36.64]It was just a bunch of bullshit.
[112:41.22]Alright, I'm alright again.
[112:50.19]Good.
[112:51.77]Just don't let that happen again.
[112:55.34]She's got a faster car than me.
[112:56.96]That's Lisa, right?
[113:01.28]Stay on the inside.
[113:04.08]She's right behind me.
[113:04.84]She's gonna pass me.
[113:09.11]No, she's right here.
[113:10.37]I got a left-hand turn coming up.
[113:16.03]Got it.
[113:16.63]Okay.
[113:18.39]That was so close.
[113:23.63]Give it to me!
[113:32.50]Give me the car!
[113:37.05]I can't take the car.
[113:38.99]This car is so much better.
[113:40.03]Is it Lisa?
[113:45.95]Well, I can't do anything about it.
[113:47.43]Not allowed.
[113:52.48]Who else has that hair?
[113:56.54]Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[114:02.51]We got a side mission.
[114:03.39]It's Grandpa.
[114:06.85]What do you need?
[114:09.95]I need your card from the war.
[114:11.41]The war?
[114:12.55]What, is the Kaiser at it again?
[114:14.54]I'll teach him.
[114:15.60]He stole my best girl and my best box of saltwater taffy.
[114:19.08]Grandpa, you're not making any sense.
[114:21.20]I'm tired because I let Jasper borrow my blood.
[114:24.22]I didn't think I'd need it.
[114:26.01]No.
[114:28.11]Saltwater taffy?
[114:30.71]I love saltwater taffy.
[114:32.25]Now you got my attention, chat.
[114:34.21]What is it?
[114:34.51]You need something?
[114:37.40]What's going on?
[114:46.05]Boomers like taffy.
[114:48.49]This camera controls in the menu.
[114:53.04]Hold on.
[114:59.02]Camera left.
[114:59.86]Oh, hold on a minute.
[115:02.36]Numpad 4.
[115:03.50]Camera left.
[115:05.85]Camera right.
[115:08.59]Camera move in.
[115:12.81]Camera move out.
[115:15.23]Camera zoom.
[115:20.68]Camera look up.
[115:27.20]Oh, that's... Okay, thank God.
[115:34.52]Well.
[115:37.40]That's, uh... That changes everything.
[115:40.49]How many times have I said that?
[115:41.45]Well, that changes everything.
[115:43.61]Out of my way, man.
[115:48.23]Six?
[115:49.29]Come on!
[115:49.61]Where, where, where is it?
[115:50.87]Where is it?
[115:51.37]What?
[116:18.40]You got it.
[116:22.06]Finding blood is easy.
[116:23.26]I'd make a great vampire.
[116:24.94]I hope this is enough.
[116:27.56]Shut up and bark.
[116:28.28]Oops.
[116:32.99]Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.
[116:41.09]Out of the way, wannabe.
[116:42.17]I don't know why I did this.
[116:44.72]I don't remember these being here before.
[116:52.29]I have to keep going into modes over and over again.
[116:54.33]What if... Hello?
[117:04.16]Action button.
[117:06.06]I pressed it.
[117:06.56]Uh...
[117:19.89]I'm interacting with the DD jar.
[117:21.91]Well, what?
[117:23.05]Mom, you're the human boy.
[117:26.17]Sure, why not?
[117:27.57]I'm, come on, I'm standing right here, and it's like, press action.
[117:30.78]Like, I'm right here.
[117:32.34]Full speed ahead.
[117:42.80]It's time for some road rage, Bart Simpson style.
[117:48.13]Wait, what?
[117:48.55]I thought he just gave it to me.
[118:00.01]Why did...
[118:18.40]I fucked that guy up bad Too many cars on the road Give me some blood
[118:39.81]I'm collecting everybody's blood.
[118:41.13]This is a little weird.
[118:42.31]I got a minute to go back to Grandpa.
[118:46.44]Eat ass?
[119:12.16]I must have the cops on me.
[119:13.26]Don't touch anybody.
[119:16.34]Oh, fuck.
[119:30.39]That's Bart's catchphrase.
[119:31.67]No, it's eat my shorts.
[119:38.85]Nice and warm.
[119:40.13]Just how I like it.
[119:41.41]Is that enough?
[119:42.09]I need another car.
[119:43.21]Take it!
[119:43.59]Ooh, I'm gonna pour this on my flapjacks.
[119:47.25]I am the king!
[119:49.22]So I got the new car.
[119:50.64]You've unlocked Grandpa's World War II vehicle.
[119:52.64]Go to a phone to use it.
[119:53.78]Okay.
[120:00.80]This thing's not bad.
[120:04.28]This better not turn out to be another one of those... It's not eat my ass.
[120:08.00]Why?
[120:08.48]No, it's eat my shorts.
[120:11.49]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!
[120:15.85]There it is.
[120:16.37]Move it, you milkshake!
[120:19.57]This thing is kind of tricky to move around.
[120:22.49]Oooh, did I do something wrong?
[120:31.01]Wait!
[120:46.39]Had to get that.
[120:47.71]What is this up here?
[120:49.97]A little place to go?
[120:51.27]Oooh, would you look at this!
[120:56.03]What's that?
[120:56.49]Oooh!
[120:59.07]No!
[121:05.53]Aww.
[121:09.45]I'll get it.
[121:15.97]One, two, three, go!
[121:19.90]I can go over there too.
[121:21.08]Oops.
[121:23.38]HURRYYYY!
[121:24.16]Give me the coins.
[121:31.08]All of them.
[121:31.76]Can I reach these without falling?
[121:32.86]Yes I can.
[121:35.65]What's this one?
[121:36.69]Mr. Honey Bunny!
[121:42.39]I'm gonna go this way too.
[121:45.35]I can platform over this thing.
[121:49.03]Having the camera controls make this a thousand times easier.
[121:52.27]Alright, there's a box over there.
[121:54.71]Another camera.
[122:08.50]Can I get them all?
[122:10.48]I think I can.
[122:10.94]I have to get it.
[122:14.86]Boxes have a lot of coins.
[122:21.59]I gotta get it.
[122:40.09]Stop moving.
[122:46.74]Alright, now just get it in the right spot.
[122:55.23]I almost blew the whole thing again.
[122:59.71]That's too many coins to just ignore.
[123:06.95]Sweet.
[123:08.55]Wait.
[123:09.28]No, that's nothing.
[123:10.72]Nothing over there?
[123:11.22]Let me just take a look.
[123:12.62]I got, uh... Crusty the Crab.
[123:21.21]I can't make that jump.
[123:21.99]Can I jump over here?
[123:22.65]No.
[123:35.69]Alright, Grandpa, let's go.
[123:37.57]Take me to my destination.
[123:43.34]This handling is ridiculous.
[123:46.00]Is this car way?
[123:48.92]Like, 30 pounds?
[123:52.02]Look at this thing.
[123:52.56]Alright, this is a gamble.
[123:56.08]Now I've got controls.
[123:57.08]I know how to play the game.
[123:58.55]I think it's time to do one of these missions.
[124:02.62]25 cents and then 75 cents.
[124:04.96]Complete an entire lap before the time runs out.
[124:06.80]Let's try it.
[124:07.18]Lord Simpson at your service.
[124:09.32]Oh, I just realized I'm using this.
[124:12.04]I see it right there.
[124:15.29]Would somebody tell me what just happened?
[124:17.87]Oop, I missed myself.
[124:21.49]Good thing that only injured my croaky side.
[124:23.65]Fuck you, Traeobliss.
[124:26.98]I thought there was a place to turn in there.
[124:30.44]There's not.
[124:31.82]You can turn the other way.
[124:56.38]What the fuck am I on two wheels for?
[124:58.46]Why did that happen?
[125:03.87]What?
[125:12.19]I'm... Wait, I'm getting... Hold on a second here.
[125:14.69]I'm getting more time.
[125:16.21]I'm gonna be able to still do this.
[125:21.22]Didn't think the old man had it in him, did ya?
[125:26.01]No, I'm not.
[125:26.59]That was a lie.
[125:31.03]It's just I have to do the whole thing in, yeah, full lap in 2.10.
[125:33.44]I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore.
[125:41.76]I should just delete and go do the mission.
[125:59.07]I just gave that guy $25.
[126:13.65]Downtown!
[126:14.81]To the stadium!
[126:15.77]I wanna go this way.

[126:35.91]That was cool.

[126:50.56]I will do that in a second after I break the vending machines.
[126:52.98]No, wait.
[126:53.28]I want to get on the phone here.
[126:59.66]I got a pregnancy test.
[127:01.18]I want to get up there.
[127:05.28]No other cards or coins or anything?
[127:07.52]Nope.

[127:58.73]Oh, cool.
[127:59.59]Real violence is way better than TV violence.
[128:02.37]It's like a level boss come to life.
[128:04.11]Video games.
[128:04.82]Video games.
[128:05.20]Who would have a World War II radio?
[128:08.30]That guy that sells all those grenades to Nelson might.
[128:10.96]I better check.
[128:14.34]Go to Herman's Military Antiques to find a World War II radio for Professor Frank.
[128:18.96]Fine by me.
[128:21.78]Oh, stop your daydreaming, melonhead, and get in the car.
[128:33.90]Um, okay.
[128:39.19]So, I need to... tail this to the military place?
[128:46.71]Press select.
[128:50.23]Uh, I can't press select.
[128:51.27]It doesn't do anything.
[129:00.30]Fill bar.
[129:04.49]Alright, I'll fill the bar, and then you'll see what happens.
[129:08.98]Yeah, I can't believe we lost, Bart!
[129:11.80]Hot diggity!
[129:17.20]Please don't tell anybody I did this.
[129:20.58]I blame Lyndon Johnson.
[129:24.74]They'll never take me alive, I tell you.
[129:27.08]Where is this guy going?
[129:29.32]What the fuck is going on?
[129:30.98]Not the detailing.
[129:42.86]You have to follow it, not tail it.
[129:44.52]If it slows down, you slow down.
[129:47.66]And then they said, idiot.
[129:51.24]Okay.
[129:55.12]Alright.
[129:59.26]Is that really that big of a deal?
[130:02.04]Apparently.
[130:02.56]I'm going to find the thief.
[130:03.56]Everyone's telling me to press select.
[130:05.26]But I can't press select on the controller.
[130:07.96]It doesn't do anything.
[130:30.45]So, uh... Like, there is no select.
[130:34.95]What is it on the keyboard?
[130:36.63]Like, escape?
[130:40.43]Because that's... I can't... The select button.
[130:50.11]It doesn't do anything.
[130:51.40]Start doesn't do anything either.
[130:56.54]Press the select key.
[131:00.48]Alright, can I... I'm just gonna play the damn game.
[131:02.43]Press the any key.
[131:13.25]I know that reference.
[131:14.87]That's Homer Simpson.
[131:22.93]What?
[131:26.50]Hey, Snake, what's up?
[131:28.12]Um, do I know you, little dude?
[131:30.00]I need that radio you borrowed.
[131:32.05]No way, little dude.
[131:33.93]This radio is going to help me score beau coup de chicks.
[131:38.87]Uh, last time I checked, chicks like fast cars, not vintage electronics.
[131:43.15]Why don't we race for the radio?
[131:45.28]Oh, I totally agree to your proposal.
[131:47.88]Alright, Snake.
[131:53.54]You and me.
[132:04.57]Alright, there's other cars on the road.
[132:05.71]I don't want to fuck this up.
[132:08.95]Why is everything so often races?
[132:12.19]That's a great question.
[132:16.77]Can't they just do, like, once, twice, three, shoot?
[132:22.06]Do we have to put everybody in danger?
[132:27.36]I wasn't first.
[132:28.44]I'll get it.
[132:29.12]Hold on, I'll get it.
[132:30.87]I'll cut him off up here.
[132:37.50]Extreme to the max.
[132:39.84]How is it even possible that you're still ahead of me?
[132:44.77]How is this possible?
[132:47.17]I'll accept it.
[132:47.95]Apparently, I'm going to accept this.
[132:55.43]I can't believe I just won.
[132:56.55]That's unbelievable.
[133:00.11]There's no way that that just happened.
[133:02.74]I won, though.
[133:03.32]Oh!
[133:09.59]God, gamer.
[133:17.74]Alright, peel it out, Grandpa.
[133:19.56]Let's go.
[133:19.88]Jerma press select.
[133:24.54]Jerma press select.
[133:25.28]Jerma press select.
[133:26.53]Jerma press select.
[133:43.84]Uh, I already did that one.
[133:54.09]What's this?
[133:54.83]Hold on, is a catapult here?
[133:56.15]Wait a minute.
[133:59.09]I need to examine a catapult.
[134:03.63]Really?
[134:04.25]Who can I... Was there an animal in there?
[134:14.05]It was.
[134:14.55]Why am I launching... Why am I doing this?
[134:18.43]That's not right.
[134:29.77]We gotta race.
[134:30.39]A catapult.
[134:35.72]A trebuchet.
[134:37.57]Complete all laps and finish the race in first place.
[134:41.09]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[134:42.59]I select to win race.
[134:44.01]I'm not going to do that.
[135:09.71]Alright.
[135:13.24]That guy... This is what they do.
[135:15.70]Every mission so far for the race missions have been... We're going to put two dickheads on the road.
[135:20.86]And then the guy in first place is the one you're actually racing against.
[135:24.43]The other two people are just obstacles in your way.
[135:30.99]Because now I'm so... Look, I'm so far behind.
[135:32.55]What?
[135:39.16]How am I going to catch up in time?
[135:41.28]You gotta get first immediately.
[135:47.64]Is there a shortcut I can do?
[135:51.89]Stop having a cow.
[135:53.75]I'm sorry.
[135:54.11]Oops.
[135:54.53]I don't think I'm going to do it.
[135:58.05]I'm going to restart.
[135:59.87]Because, yeah, there's no way.
[136:01.15]I'm not going to catch up with this guy.
[136:02.11]What are you talking about?
[136:03.95]There's no way I'm going to catch up.
[136:08.50]Just go faster.
[136:09.96]I'm holding down right trigger.
[136:12.00]See, watch this.
[136:18.50]It's Lisa.
[136:19.26]It's Lisa again.
[136:20.02]Your car is great and you're a great driver.
[136:23.14]Alright.
[136:28.62]I made it through the... No, I didn't.
[136:29.84]They're still here.
[136:41.57]Alright.
[136:42.55]Alright, I'm not in a bad position.
[136:53.09]Just gonna keep... keep it up.
[137:10.02]Alright, get in there.
[137:11.44]Get in there!
[137:17.53]Good.
[137:19.85]She lost it there for a second.
[137:23.91]Having trouble.
[137:27.17]Stay on the inside.
[137:36.57]I don't want to run into you.
[137:39.91]That's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[137:42.99]What did he just say?
[137:45.36]Hold on.
[137:46.06]What?
[137:55.60]Alright.
[137:56.84]Every time I end up bumping into you here.
[137:58.62]Come on.
[138:02.49]Come on.
[138:06.31]Come on, this is the end, right?
[138:07.48]I gotta do the last one and get the car for this stage, right?
[138:34.02]I'm not gonna lie, I was just pressing up on the d-pad to call the horse.
[138:42.65]Alright, look at the last race.
[138:43.93]Where is the final race?
[138:50.93]Hmm.
[139:06.17]I don't know.
[139:10.05]Wow, that was interesting.
[139:13.81]Go through here.
[139:14.25]Press select for the map.
[139:34.90]There is no map.
[139:38.14]Yes, there is.
[139:44.80]I just pressed M. Select to use boost.
[139:58.14]Ooh, how do I get that?
[140:03.88]It's time for some road rage.
[140:05.90]Bart Simpson style.
[140:11.58]Get out of here, B. Alright, if I climb up there, I should get it.
[140:14.74]Right here.
[140:25.99]Kind of hard to see.
[140:30.22]Damn, that's tricky.
[140:36.26]The camera doesn't want to stay in the right place.
[140:54.31]Big Butt Skinner.
[140:55.65]Alright, over to the Krusty Burger.
[141:09.24]Speaking of burgers, I could go for a burger.
[141:12.54]A huge one.
[141:16.00]A double, at least.
[141:16.78]I would take a triple.
[141:18.00]No, that's too much.
[141:25.42]I'm gonna sneeze now.
[141:26.04]Can I mutant type?
[141:27.13]Did I get it?
[141:29.07]I think I got it.
[141:29.65]Best burger place?
[141:30.27]I'm a big fan of Shake Shack.
[141:59.59]I'm gonna get all these.
[142:13.83]Uh, Five Guys is good.
[142:16.52]Shake Shack, but I would put Shake Shack above Five Guys.
[142:25.40]We're talking, like, counter-surf burgers and, yeah.
[142:27.81]Shake Shack, yes.
[142:28.55]Yeah, that's number one.
[142:32.23]Um, can you please not be directly in the path that I need?
[142:41.19]And the train's coming!
[142:52.81]Best restaurant burger actually sitting down at a restaurant.
[142:59.92]I had the best burger I've ever had in my life.
[143:03.48]And it's down on the strip.
[143:10.46]Oh fuck, I have to deliver this now.
[143:17.30]The Hash House has the best burger I've ever had in my whole life.
[143:21.06]From a sit-down restaurant.
[143:22.04]It was absolutely fucking unbelievable.
[143:29.17]Am I gonna make this?
[143:41.27]Am I not paying attention?
[143:43.53]Did I fuck something?
[143:44.25]No, I'm not.
[143:44.55]I'm fine.
[143:47.01]If I had In-N-Out.
[143:47.73]Yeah, I'm not a fan of In-N-Out.
[143:49.56]I'm... I don't really... No, I'm not like a big fan of In-N-Out.
[143:52.88]I think it's just kind of like a Wendy's cheeseburger that's cheap.
[143:57.92]Sorry, guys.
[144:01.64]Now we gots to deliver the delicious goods to the fire.
[144:05.63]What?
[144:06.31]Get away from... I don't hate In-N-Out.
[144:11.52]I think it's good.
[144:12.74]But I think it's like a... It's like a step up from a place like Wendy's, I think.
[144:17.46]The best thing about In-N-Out is In-N-Out is really fast and it's really cheap.
[144:20.39]Um, am I gonna lose right now?
[144:34.85]But, I don't know.
[144:36.69]Me and Star went to In-N-Out.
[144:38.71]And people were like, go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out.
[144:40.61]We went to In-N-Out, and it was... Both of us said the same thing.
[144:44.76]We were like, oh, that was alright, I guess.
[144:46.52]I'm going the wrong way.
[145:00.22]There's nothing wrong with In-N-Out.
[145:04.66]It's just... I don't think it's at this extreme godlike level that some people say it is.
[145:11.51]Stop it.
[145:12.45]Stop it.
[145:12.81]Got it.
[145:33.58]But I think that's the problem, though, because it's just like a good hamburger.
[145:39.90]People lift it up to be this thing that you have to eat, and, like, God will come down and grace you when you put it in your mouth.
[145:51.08]Like, once you take a bite of an In-N-Out burger, God appears and says, Don't you like that I made it for you?
[145:56.58]Nice driving, man.
[146:05.70]You expect me to complete a Mark 10 Truckasaurus without a blender?
[146:09.58]Why don't I just make a Plasmoclave without a tennis racket for playing out loud?
[146:14.10]My compliments to the chef.
[146:18.59]Now where am I going to get a blender?
[146:22.23]Dr. Nick!
[146:23.39]He loves blended grilled drinks during surgery.
[146:25.69]Do the last race?
[146:26.97]Is this the last mission?
[146:31.03]Maybe I'll just cancel the thing.
[146:33.37]Well, I guess I'm not even doing it, so...
[146:40.14]Alright, where is the last race?
[146:41.93]We got one here, we already did that one.
[146:43.87]I don't want to do that yet.
[146:53.86]Not yet.
[146:59.62]Somebody just said, In-N-Out is a slightly better McDonald's.
[147:03.96]I don't know if I would go that far.
[147:06.45]To say that.
[147:17.81]And, no, I did that one.
[147:18.97]Where's the last one?
[147:29.34]Oh, there's the two there.
[147:30.26]They're right next to each other.
[147:31.32]Anybody know where it is?
[147:39.70]I have no fucking idea.
[147:47.07]Why is everybody add- hold on, wait, why is everybody adding... add... What are you doing?
[148:00.60]What are you doing?
[148:02.06]No, stop this.
[148:03.18]Stop this nonsense!
[148:08.80]What is this?
[148:12.65]Oh, sorry, I just saw them and I had to...
[148:16.59]What are you doing?
[148:22.42]You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.
[148:29.58]Did I break the phone?
[148:30.78]Get out of the taxi!
[148:36.31]I can still use it.
[148:37.03]Alright, I want the family car.
[148:47.11]Alright, alright, alright.
[148:53.07]Am I gonna have to, like, put it into fuckin'... slowdown mode?
[149:01.31]Last race is next to Sneed.
[149:03.31]Where is that, though?
[149:05.19]I haven't seen this television show in my life.
[149:07.20]Over this way?
[149:12.68]Alright, am I going the right way?
[149:14.88]If I go through the buzz cola sign.
[149:23.15]Did I just say something I shouldn't have said?
[149:28.37]It's near the fire truck ramp.
[149:30.71]That's kind of far away.
[149:44.73]Did I actually just say something?
[149:52.41]There's Moe's.
[149:54.27]Head down here.
[149:56.98]This is the factory.
[150:12.98]I really don't know where the hell I'm even going.
[150:15.38]Hey, guys, just be honest with me.
[150:23.71]Am I even going remotely in the right direction?
[150:33.25]No.
[150:35.85]I passed it?
[150:37.26]No, I didn't.
[150:43.26]The mini-map.
[150:44.60]But there's nothing on the mini-map.
[150:46.30]There's just that flip.
[150:53.38]I'm looking for the race.
[150:55.43]Downtown.
[150:59.11]Sneed is not downtown.
[151:00.45]Just go in any direction long enough and you're going to find it.
[151:23.74]What the fuck?
[151:25.64]Alright.
[151:25.96]You know what?
[151:27.18]I don't know.
[151:33.74]I found it.
[151:35.68]Take this.
[151:38.40]Oh, awesome, man.
[151:39.38]That was the best ride ever.
[151:42.24]Milhouse, what are you doing here?
[151:43.66]I thought you had a 4 o'clock wedgie with Nelson.
[151:45.96]I rescheduled.
[151:47.55]The DMV has us all doing these stupid races.
[151:55.16]pump now, man.
[151:56.92]I'm so amped up for this.
[152:12.18]This is weird.
[152:16.88]Did I do something wrong?
[152:24.36]I don't... this is weird.
[152:35.69]Am I going the right way?
[152:36.45]Do I have to actually... I'm so confused.
[152:46.90]One more lap?
[152:57.90]What the hell is going on?
[153:02.60]Somebody said, go through the roundabout, and I don't know why I even looked at the chat.
[153:06.15]Go through the roundabout.
[153:07.35]What am I doing?
[153:09.61]You can't.
[153:10.13]You have to go around the whole thing.
[153:14.15]Go through the roundabout.
[153:15.05]There's a roundabout.
[153:15.85]What are you doing?
[153:16.55]And I'm like, aye, aye, yeah.
[153:19.70]Yeah.
[153:29.83]He's very smart.
[153:43.42]This time, I'm not gonna look at chat.
[153:44.98]I'm just gonna do it.
[153:46.82]I'm so fucking mad.
[153:48.42]I'm so fucking mad.
[153:57.13]It only took like... Well, how long did it take?
[153:59.91]Was it two hours?
[154:00.65]No, it's been a while.
[154:01.81]I haven't had like a meltdown yet.
[154:04.14]No, there aren't going to be a meltdown tonight.
[154:05.62]This is Simpsons.
[154:06.44]Bart Simpson drives around and throws stuff and runs away.
[154:10.46]I'm not going to get angry at it.
[154:13.26]Why would that happen?
[154:19.98]I just saved two or three full seconds.
[154:28.48]You already are.
[154:29.49]I'm not.
[154:30.11]You would know if I was.
[154:31.25]I would have made like a weird sound effect.
[154:34.85]You know what I mean?
[154:35.79]Do it.
[154:51.04]It's right here.
[154:55.97]Go to a phone booth to get Moe's Sedan.
[154:57.99]Let's check it out.
[154:58.67]Moe's Sedan.
[155:26.64]It's not bad.
[155:31.53]This is one, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[155:35.05]One, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[155:37.05]One, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[155:38.91]Two, one and a half, two and a half, three and a half.
[155:41.49]That's better.
[155:44.06]It's not actually, it's not Moe driving the car.
[155:53.22]This is just, this is actually a child driving this car.
[155:57.13]I mean, I got to go over that.
[155:58.57]How could I not do that?
[156:04.60]Not enough speed.
[156:05.34]Come on.
[156:05.60]What are you trying?
[156:06.16]There are over 5,000 people here.
[156:07.44]You're going to just drive over that slowly?
[156:10.60]Are you kidding me?
[156:19.13]Get it, get it, get it.
[156:25.56]Come on, streamer, you gotta impress us!
[156:29.94]Alright, Professor Frank, I got your stuff.
[156:41.74]There you go.
[156:42.59]You expect me to complete a Mark 10 Truckasaurus without a blender?
[156:46.48]Why don't I just make a Plasmoclave without a tennis racket for playing out loud?
[156:51.24]Now fetch me a blender with the puree and the frappe and the liquify.
[156:55.50]Now where am I gonna get a blender?
[156:58.03]Everybody... Dr. Nick!
[157:00.29]He loves blended grilled drinks during surgery.
[157:02.09]Look it over in the chat.
[157:03.27]It's just so many emotions.
[157:05.63]I don't even know which one to... to interact with.
[157:13.29]There's so much going on over here.
[157:23.03]Alright, talk to Dr. Nick.
[157:31.58]No, I ain't playing.
[157:33.98]I'm not playing a fucking OST.
[157:35.38]I'm not playing an OST right now.
[158:00.11]That's not gonna happen.
[158:01.87]No.
[158:03.45]You'll need the... Plow truck.
[158:06.81]Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 200 coins.
[158:12.76]Don't I already own it?
[158:13.44]I already own it.
[158:35.80]There was a T-pose there.
[158:36.90]I can't wait to see it in chat.
[158:38.58]Now we're in emote only.
[158:39.34]Emote only.
[158:39.90]Oh, the fucking title sucks.
[158:41.24]This title sucks such ass.
[158:42.82]I forgot.
[158:43.60]That's a placeholder.
[159:06.70]I just looked over and saw it.
[159:07.74]Oh well.
[159:15.38]Find all the monkeys before they escape.
[159:19.70]30 of... Oh god.
[159:22.68]Okay, I gotta go to one corner of the map.
[159:26.18]This is not good.
[159:29.31]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[159:33.11]Alright, they start here.
[159:43.09]No!
[159:43.65]He's lost their mind.
[159:51.08]Why is everybody freaking out?
[159:58.84]Oh, I gotta pay attention.
[160:00.44]Alright, we'll have a chat.
[160:02.46]Later.
[160:15.15]across here in town.
[160:25.95]I'm good.
[160:26.37]I got almost halfway there and I got plenty of time.
[160:30.55]Oh dear, there's platforming involved in this.
[160:35.33]Platforming's involved.
[160:37.65]I thought it was just driving.
[160:42.05]Oh, shit.
[160:48.60]Shit.
[160:48.96]How do I?
[160:53.68]Nice driving, man.
[160:55.20]Get up there.
[160:55.90]I see it.
[160:56.28]It's right here.
[160:56.84]Come on, now.
[160:58.60]Stick the dismount.
[161:02.84]Why do these stupid things make me feel so good?
[161:09.04]That's it.
[161:10.40]Turn around.
[161:12.19]Any more on top of roofs or anything?
[161:16.85]Get in the car!
[161:17.97]17... 18... 19...
[161:39.30]Come on.
[161:43.64]Get through there.
[161:44.30]Actually, I got plenty of time.
[161:52.23]Just don't freak out about it.
[161:58.29]I'm still missing five.
[162:06.19]Where on Earth are the other five?
[162:08.96]Forget about the bee, it's not important.
[162:17.58]Jump to light speed, Bart.
[162:19.84]That doesn't exist.
[162:21.30]I got it.
[162:23.66]I'm gonna end it on the stairs.
[162:44.82]Alright, that was not... I didn't need to panic at all.
[162:46.44]That was... I'm done.
[162:49.19]Drive to the Screaming Monkey Medical Center.
[162:51.53]What?
[163:04.67]Got it.
[163:06.69]Don't deliver them.
[163:18.54]Why wouldn't I deliver them?
[163:30.36]Oh, I see.
[163:30.92]I kinda like the plow.
[163:35.42]I didn't like it at first, but now I do.
[163:44.86]I'm back.
[163:45.84]What were the popular cell phones that existed back then?
[163:47.79]This is what, 2004?
[163:48.07]Was the original iPhone even out?
[164:14.93]Destroy all the cell phone users' cars before time runs out.
[164:19.29]Get into your car.
[164:23.62]No, this is like old flip phones, right?
[164:26.50]This is gonna be a horrible mission.
[164:43.92]She just baited me.
[164:45.56]So bad.
[164:47.04]Did you really just do that to me?
[164:56.20]Phones that are attached to cars.
[164:59.83]You motherfucker, I swear to god.
[165:11.63]No!
[165:23.78]Look at how easy that is.
[165:32.90]He's almost done.
[165:36.96]Great alien music, too.
[165:47.84]You should be done.
[165:49.38]You should be dead.
[165:53.31]Destroyed.
[165:53.93]Ah, there's another one back here.
[165:58.17]You turning around?
[165:58.93]What way are you driving?
[166:04.40]Oh, dummy.
[166:04.90]Get out of the way.
[166:05.48]Where are you going?
[166:16.20]Perfect.
[166:19.50]Do you think time is added for every car that's destroyed?
[166:22.58]That would be really bad if it didn't.
[166:32.57]Good thing my facecam's not on.
[166:34.11]That would have been an embarrassing face.
[166:35.73]Oh man, that sucks and blows.
[166:44.40]My rims cost $900!
[166:49.23]I just bit down on my lower mouth.
[166:52.27]I like ate the bottom half of my mouth.
[167:05.68]Fucking tubers.
[167:08.55]This is a really bad day.
[167:15.91]Sad day for the generic amount.
[167:21.91]Those fucking tubers.
[167:28.73]Get him!
[167:29.33]Would you just get him?
[167:30.17]I didn't do it.
[167:37.60]My butt hurts.
[167:52.24]Why does that not count?
[167:53.94]My car is gonna explode, I need a wrench.
[168:00.18]I got it.
[168:04.29]Alright, where's the wrench?
[168:05.61]There's a wrench up here, I think.
[168:07.95]Right at the top, right?
[168:11.67]Yep.
[168:14.17]Stupid!
[168:15.87]You're stupid!
[168:19.19]Alright, you're fine.
[168:19.93]You're smart.
[168:24.69]You're stupid!
[168:30.93]Full throttle, right in the back.
[168:32.05]That's not what I wanted.
[168:37.58]That's no damage at all.
[168:39.86]His car used my car as a brake.
[168:45.92]No, other way around.
[168:55.85]Come here.
[168:57.69]Come here.
[169:01.33]What the heck are you thinking?
[169:09.85]That's totally awesome!
[169:11.35]Alright, he's doing it to himself.
[169:12.58]Good.
[169:12.80]I win.
[169:13.70]Oh, that was so cool!
[169:17.06]There's a sign right here.
[169:21.70]Got it.
[169:23.93]I got three and a half minutes.
[169:24.79]3.50, I'm good to go.
[169:27.49]Just gonna wrap around.
[169:33.29]That mission sucked.
[169:34.07]That was a hard one.
[169:46.75]Is this the actual game's music?
[169:48.39]Yeah.
[169:48.54]If you stay in your car when it blows up, you can drive around in a blown up car.
[169:50.74]Really.
[169:51.18]Wow, Truckasaurus is some kind of truck slash dinosaur.
[169:53.10]I never would have guessed.
[170:16.84]first boss Jimmy Neutron dog what's the dog's name from Jimmy Neutron Gertrude or something
[170:50.03]Goddard.
[170:50.41]Yeah.
[170:50.55]Did I just get abducted?
[170:59.76]707, 101, 303.
[171:04.20]I didn't get any new clothes for Bart.
[171:20.56]No new clothes for Bart.
[171:22.92]It's time for Lisa?
[171:24.40]Yep.
[171:32.85]I get Lisa's car, which is the best car in the game.
[171:37.88]Might as well look and see what the other costumes are.
[171:43.62]Lisa, cool.
[171:50.05]What?
[171:52.11]Hockey.
[171:58.67]I mean, I have to get that.
[172:04.69]Toy Train?
[172:05.63]I know what it's like to build one of those.
[172:10.80]Is there a dead person in that costume?
[172:15.74]It is the YouTuber outfit, you're right.
[172:17.92]This is the streamer outfit.
[172:22.90]Funny streamer outfit.
[172:23.64]Yeah, it is.
[172:24.48]Raise the nerd to the Itchy and Scratchy store.
[172:26.34]Get the comic book back before time runs out.
[172:28.04]Oh, it's a different nerd.
[172:29.14]It's like... I don't like the nerd car.
[173:21.28]Impatient.
[173:23.34]No, I just don't- that's a guaranteed loss.
[173:28.32]I'm so far ahead of him.
[173:48.62]We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[173:51.16]Should I go with this?
[174:07.97]We must learn how to drive.
[174:11.41]I have had enough of you.
[174:12.55]Hey, watch it!
[174:16.83]Got the comic.
[174:17.47]Oh, shit.
[174:17.81]They don't let you take a break.
[174:19.19]It's just... Now it's time to go fast again.
[174:22.55]You get to go really fast.
[174:24.33]They stopped.
[174:50.50]Nooo.
[174:51.06]No.
[174:53.48]No.
[174:53.88]Nice spill joke.
[175:19.05]Now to get this inky treasure into its Mylar sanctuary.
[175:22.31]What about Bart?
[175:24.00]I asked you, have you seen him?
[175:26.00]I think I saw him at the Noiseland Arcade.
[175:29.18]Ugh, video games.
[175:30.74]What a waste of money.
[175:32.51]Now to go online and bid $1,000 for itchy and scratchy corncob holders.
[175:37.55]A terrific, terrific expense.
[175:39.17]I am the lizard queen!
[175:48.44]Oh, really?
[175:48.98]I don't think you're going to be doing that anytime soon.
[175:52.20]Alright, hold on.
[176:00.94]I don't want to do this yet.
[176:02.26]Let me look around.
[176:04.56]There's money everywhere.
[176:13.10]Secrets.
[176:14.02]Gags.
[176:14.58]I don't want to just blow through the whole video game.
[176:21.74]Plus, I gotta pee.
[176:23.84]Don't you know that Jeremy goes pee every two to three hours on the dock?
[176:31.10]That's just what happens.
[176:32.49]I missed a coin.
[176:33.73]Who cares?
[176:34.17]Alright, there's a machine over there.
[176:40.19]What is this?
[176:40.85]Gag!
[176:42.47]Snakes!
[176:42.63]Snakes everywhere!
[176:52.10]It's time for a meltdown.
[176:55.46]Is this a meltdown mission?
[176:56.78]I don't know if it is.
[177:07.08]Please change the outfit.
[177:08.08]It sucks.
[177:09.28]Thanks.
[177:12.46]No, I can't.
[177:13.28]Not that quickly.
[177:14.08]This is $250.
[177:14.50]Not until you're like 16.
[177:22.87]You don't want to drink coffee until you're at least, like, 15 or 16, at least.
[177:32.54]Ooh.
[177:32.98]Why is that?
[177:34.76]Because... I started drinking coffee when I was 20.
[177:50.70]I just look like Gumby.
[177:52.20]Didn't Gumby drive around in a car like this?
[177:53.90]Alright, I gotta pee.
[178:02.09]I'll be right back.
[178:04.99]See you in, like, three minutes.
[178:06.07]Be right back.
[178:31.98]Thank you.
[179:58.18]Hey.
[180:29.21]Let's go.
[180:39.35]Don't scare me like that.
[180:41.35]What, I muted the mic and I just went, hey.
[180:48.56]What is Lisa's double jump?
[180:50.76]Hold on, let me just open this fresh beer.
[181:04.05]Ooh.
[181:07.23]Hi, Nelson.
[181:08.13]This is a surprise.
[181:09.67]Oh, the pleasure is all mine.
[181:12.31]It's a ginger ale.
[181:14.43]Relax.
[181:16.15]It's a Canada Dry.
[181:17.43]Three, two, loser says what?
[181:25.51]Prove it.
[181:27.51]I can't.
[181:27.89]I don't have any clothes on.
[181:31.65]I'm going to go wrap a blanket around myself and then turn the camera on for a second.
[181:35.51]Well, that somehow fucked me up completely.
[181:49.53]At least this car is the best.
[181:50.85]Oh, I don't know why you just freaked me out doing that.
[181:53.87]But you did.
[181:54.35]Head of the class!
[181:58.21]This is just a temporary setback.
[182:06.44]Are you really coming up behind me right now?
[182:11.14]Uh, what?
[182:14.52]Easy!
[182:15.14]Alright, I gotta be careful going down.
[182:17.04]And you went perfectly down there.
[182:19.58]No way.
[182:19.96]I don't believe that for a second.
[182:28.78]You're in second place, Lisa.
[182:33.88]Alright, now go down gently.
[182:37.54]Oh, fuck.
[182:48.75]I can still get it.
[182:50.99]It's still pretty, pretty possible.
[182:56.51]Okay, easy.
[182:58.09]Got it.
[183:00.86]Oh, it's gonna be close.
[183:03.37]He's right up my ass.
[183:19.50]Ah!
[183:20.16]Don't!
[183:20.76]Why did you?
[183:21.40]Oh, don't!
[183:21.92]We're good.
[183:39.33]Can I get my car back, please?
[183:40.91]Thank you.
[183:43.29]What is this?
[183:45.36]Bonus!
[183:49.96]Principal Skinner, Bart's missing.
[183:52.32]Bart's gone?
[183:53.74]What a tragedy.
[183:55.33]To get your mind off this terrible loss, which we all feel, why don't you run a few errands, or as I call them, grief helpers for me?
[184:01.55]But Bart's only missing.
[184:03.13]Well, looking for that little monster.
[184:04.89]I mean, treasure can't help anything.
[184:08.22]You might as well pick up Mother's- Skinner looks like a bird.
[184:10.34]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[184:17.38]Now you might as well pick up my dry cleaning for me.
[184:23.12]You might as well pick up my dry.
[184:24.86]Fine mother.
[184:28.34]It's real hard to get an empty stomach.
[184:41.96]You've got to eat a shitload of greasy food before you can do that, boys.
[184:47.42]End of the stream, boys.
[184:49.04]What are you on about?
[184:49.94]I'm still enjoying The Simpsons hit-and-run video game.
[184:52.16]Why would I turn the stream off right now?
[185:10.19]Care-care-care for a steamed ab?
[185:20.13]I've seen that video.
[185:21.51]I have nine seconds!
[185:22.57]Hello, Springfield!
[185:39.73]Stupid!
[185:40.97]Are we in Europe?
[185:46.82]How am I a bad driver?
[185:48.38]It's Principal Skinner Driver.
[185:54.66]But I have seen the hams video.
[185:56.37]I've seen it before.
[186:04.79]I can't believe he's playing my childhood game.
[186:07.98]It holds up pretty well.
[186:09.06]It kind of does.
[186:31.87]I mean, if this was on the PlayStation... This is on PC, by the way.
[186:36.12]I have it for PlayStation 2, but I feel like it would be better on PC, the graphics and shit.
[186:44.65]You know what I mean.
[186:49.25]The PS2 version runs at like 20 FPS.
[186:50.73]That probably would have been unbearable to watch.
[186:52.71]Hold on.
[186:52.89]Alright, I think I'm okay.
[186:53.59]Now I'm gonna sneeze.
[187:19.68]Do you guys ever like to choke on air?
[187:24.22]I just talked and I said too many words on my throat and I just choked on my own voice.
[187:30.00]I'm good.
[187:34.24]Where's my car?
[187:39.28]Principal Skinner, I can't help you anymore.
[187:41.99]I need to search for Bart.
[187:44.07]Lisa, I apologize from the bottom of my Vietnam veteran's heart.
[187:48.11]I promise this next stop will be the last.
[187:50.50]I don't like everything's timed.
[187:52.34]Everything's timed.
[187:53.32]It makes it too stressful.
[187:55.64]Sorry, sorry.
[187:57.76]Let the city pay for it.
[188:06.08]I'm missing a place to jump down quickly, I think.
[188:16.22]It's right ahead.
[188:19.64]Okay, I'm gonna get it right with the jump.
[188:21.58]No, it's right there.
[188:22.34]I don't have the timer anymore.
[188:29.89]Okay.
[188:30.13]Relax.
[188:30.31]Get up there.
[188:52.22]I just have to go near it and activate it.
[188:57.88]I forgot I was this character.
[188:59.00]Thank you!
[189:01.19]Push him into the ocean.
[189:40.98]It wasn't even the worst joke.
[189:42.26]That was fun.
[189:42.92]I can't believe that one.
[189:48.21]That one over me taking 15 minutes to sync up and queue up a Nightcrawler line from X-Men 2.
[189:57.57]Really?
[189:57.83]Speaking of fucking really... Yes, mother...
[190:12.62]No!
[190:12.98]What the- I- I pressed, like, uh, it came up so- Whatever.
[190:32.89]I could be so angry at this.
[190:35.47]God damn it.
[190:38.39]Ah.
[190:47.09]I don't... Wait.
[190:49.67]Can you just fail missions?
[190:51.79]You just don't finish them.
[190:53.55]So I just... I can't do that one again.
[190:57.09]I just skipped it.
[191:16.27]Oh.
[191:22.86]Who's driving the car?
[191:24.28]It's not a mill house, is it?
[191:31.72]Hey, wasn't I just talking to you?
[191:34.44]Mm, smell that fresh air.
[191:36.22]I was just, you just, I was.
[191:38.18]What are you doing here?
[191:39.26]What's going on?
[191:39.87]Lisa, what a coincidence.
[191:42.53]Hey, is that a new dress?
[191:45.01]No, I've been wearing this dress for years.
[191:47.37]Now, where's Bart?
[191:49.77]I think he's at the Planet Hype.
[191:53.83]I'm telling Weekend Dad.
[191:59.25]Drive to Planet Hype.
[192:01.75]Uh, is he back in the chat, ladies?
[192:26.31]Can't go that way.
[192:33.78]Idiot, get out of my way.
[192:46.97]I'm not gonna make it.
[192:48.35]I'm not gonna make it.
[192:49.07]I'm not gonna make it.
[192:50.21]I'm not gonna make it.
[192:52.27]I'm not gonna make it.
[192:59.64]What just happened to all my money?
[193:01.77]What?
[193:31.07]How much money did it take?
[193:35.72]They just took so much money from me.
[193:59.46]From here, I guess just... I'm just going through here.
[194:03.66]I won't question the value of this activity.
[194:06.78]Knock the car!
[194:11.41]I can go, girl.
[194:12.95]I need speed.
[194:15.29]More speed!
[194:17.49]Looks like I'm not in the night...
[194:27.55]I thought it was a shortcut and I could go through.
[194:30.41]Apparently not.
[194:43.26]Apparently not.
[194:46.64]Speaking of shortcuts, there's one right... I missed it already.
[194:48.90]There's another one right there.
[195:10.72]Is this going to work if I go over this?
[195:12.16]Because I had to go down all the way to the beach.
[195:16.28]Can I drive through this?
[195:17.46]Oh, no!
[195:19.90]And that was efficient.
[195:29.15]What a perfect day.
[195:32.57]Before I do this, get the car in the right spot, please.
[195:35.97]I need speed.
[195:36.73]More speed.
[195:39.07]Oh, hi, Lisa.
[195:45.09]Efficient to drown.
[195:47.18]Maybe.
[195:49.76]Can I pull?
[195:51.10]No, there's no way to pull left here, except to stay here.
[196:03.99]Straight down, and then... I don't know if that's a little shortcut that I can go through with the Krusty Klan thing.
[196:10.80]It looks like it, but maybe I went the wrong way?
[196:19.97]I mean, it looks like I can go through here.
[196:24.31]No, I can't.
[196:24.89]It's just, it's a debate.
[196:25.87]It's bullshit.
[196:26.65]It's horse shit.
[196:28.51]It's just horse shit.
[196:29.75]What's happening?
[196:38.06]Could've... That's gonna happen again.
[196:42.10]Oh my lord in heaven, give me a break.
[196:44.02]Oh my god.
[196:44.70]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[196:52.13]You have a gift for speed.
[196:55.22]This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
[197:09.97]No, I don't want your shitty car.
[197:16.53]Give me back my good car.
[197:19.20]Where's a phone?
[197:30.30]Give me the Lisa Simpson best car in the game car, please.
[197:34.88]Oh, come on!
[197:48.54]Give me a wrench so I can have a... There's a card up there, but you know what?
[197:54.73]Here's a wrench.
[197:55.83]I'm ready.
[198:22.57]Can't turn that way.
[198:35.71]Alright.
[198:36.95]I'm gonna try- I got enough speed, I think.
[198:42.67]Oh shit!
[198:44.02]I made it, I did it, I did it!
[198:44.98]Okay, we're fine, everything's fine!
[198:46.96]Now... Now we relax.
[198:54.76]I'm ready.
[198:56.08]This is the last time I'm gonna do this shit.
[198:58.00]Here we go.
[198:59.08]Go!
[199:10.31]Don't- I'm- I can't just drive on the boardwalk like this and not get in trouble.
[199:15.78]Here we go.
[199:22.75]Don't go through the fake shortcut.
[199:24.89]It's not real.
[199:26.25]Just drive there.
[199:40.21]What is happening with the car?
[199:47.98]I did it.
[199:53.35]Alright, Mailhouse, what do you got?
[199:54.27]Kick him into the water.
[199:55.84]No.
[199:55.90]If this is... Okay, if this is the end of the mission, then I will.
[199:57.30]Alright, mission complete.
[200:25.04]What?
[200:25.60]Oh.
[200:49.24]Alright, I'm going for it.
[200:51.03]No, never mind.
[200:52.67]I was trying to drop the car on him.
[200:54.17]Why am I doing that to Milhouse?
[200:55.51]Just drive!
[201:02.73]Drop like a car on him.
[201:15.15]Nobody likes Milhouse.
[201:17.54]Somebody does.
[201:19.36]I'm sure somebody does.
[201:26.76]I do?
[201:27.10]Yeah, see?
[201:27.62]Hold on a minute.
[201:35.45]What's this shit right here?
[201:36.25]Look at that.
[201:40.01]Uh, platforming?
[201:42.36]Ah, would you look at that.
[201:49.30]Almost fell off.
[202:00.13]There's a geyser.
[202:03.49]Evil Braces!
[202:05.14]Ooh, something else over here.
[202:08.08]What's this?
[202:20.95]Don't get cocky here.
[202:21.83]Because I want to see what this is.
[202:23.29]Okay, I got them all.
[202:32.42]Whoa, where am I?
[202:43.08]Oh, that's a little area that you're not supposed to find.
[202:49.74]Alright, well, cool.
[202:50.40]Anything else?
[202:51.72]Don't forget that one coin.
[202:53.12]People will scream at you.
[202:55.96]That's cool.
[203:01.42]Why is there no selfie mode?
[203:09.86]Ginger ale or riot?
[203:11.04]Oh, God.
[203:11.80]Hold on.
[203:12.20]I'm having people draw on myself right now.
[203:21.83]Alright, so here.
[203:44.44]Can I even turn this off in here?
[203:59.21]If this crashes the game, I'm gonna be very upset with you guys.
[204:01.27]Okay.
[204:07.21]See?
[204:25.68]It's off, right?
[204:26.28]Yeah.
[204:34.18]What?
[204:36.80]Save, save, save.
[204:38.04]It's alright.
[204:38.40]I don't think there's a problem.
[204:40.90]I just thought the camera was still on.
[204:43.06]Thank god it's not.
[204:50.54]We good?
[204:51.14]Did I- I didn't- Did I fucking crash it?
[204:53.21]I hope not.
[204:54.13]When was the last time I saved the game?
[204:55.71]Why did that have to happen?
[205:00.89]God damn it.
[205:02.53]Un-fucking-believable.
[205:16.68]Oh no, that's not good.
[205:18.84]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[205:20.16]It might not be crashed.
[205:30.07]It just might need a second.
[205:34.96]Hold on.
[205:49.06]Come on.
[205:50.02]It's coming back.
[205:50.58]It's got the black screen.
[205:51.40]It looks like it's trying.
[205:52.20]Come on.
[205:57.09]Come on.
[206:09.67]What have I done?
[206:40.24]I don't know how far back that save is.
[206:41.82]Because I had to alt-tab and prove that I'm not drinking alcohol.
[206:50.07]God damn it.
[207:07.27]I think my whole computer is broken.
[207:13.50]Well... Give me a fucking break.
[207:45.38]I'm gonna try it again.
[207:53.12]Fucking come on, really?
[207:58.18]I can't believe that.
[208:00.60]That's absolute bullshit.
[208:03.10]God damn it.
[208:06.89]And now I can't get the fucking game to launch.
[208:17.03]You gotta be kidding me.
[208:19.09]The game physically won't launch.
[208:21.19]I might have to restart my computer.
[208:37.63]No, it's not in the task manager.
[208:52.06]We were just going so well.
[208:55.36]And I had to alt-tab.
[208:56.62]I'm gonna try one more thing.
[209:05.35]And then... Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[209:12.79]Of course, I hit the fucking alt-tab button and the whole stream has to turn off.
[209:17.42]God damn it.
[209:41.20]let's try it again
[210:26.78]No, it's not in the Task Manager.
[210:28.14]It's just, for some reason, it doesn't think I have DirectX anymore.
[210:32.05]I'm going to have to restart the computer.
[210:46.78]Unless I can... No.
[210:49.06]No.
[210:55.12]This is gonna kill the whole stream, too.
[210:57.58]What a pain in the ass.
[210:58.46]Alright.
[211:18.62]No, no, no, don't, I'm not, don't change my password on, what am I doing?
[211:25.07]It might be because OBS is still running.
[211:27.07]It's... I don't know.
[211:29.40]I'm trying to find it in the Task Manager and I don't see anything here.
[212:01.64]Oh, I was enjoying that too.
[212:03.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[212:19.74]Wait, wait!
[212:49.41]Let's go!
[213:22.30]Oh!
[213:22.40]This is the first mission of the game!
[213:24.72]No, it's the first- Slow down, it's okay.
[213:34.83]Shit!
[213:35.23]Alright, I'm gonna do it quick.
[213:37.81]God dammit, and a bunch of people left too because they thought it was over.
[213:41.00]So did I!
[213:42.00]Oh, come on!
[213:44.94]Quick, do everything I did really fast.
[213:54.61]Speedrun.
[213:55.74]Actually, legit speedrun.
[213:56.96]I ain't fucking around.
[213:58.24]We're getting there in five minutes.
[213:59.86]Watch this shit.
[214:02.48]I'm so... I'm so flustered.
[214:30.87]Here's the shortcut, I just missed it again!
[214:32.59]Go, go, go, go, go, quick, come on!
[214:56.36]That was a bunch of anger and rage building up in my stomach.
[215:31.00]Hit select to boost.
[215:32.47]No, I don't care.
[215:33.71]I don't care.
[215:38.13]No alt tabs.
[215:39.61]No like fucking show dick.
[215:41.59]No, I'm not doing it.
[215:43.05]We're playing Simpsons.
[215:44.67]Smash the like button.
[216:01.92]Ah, fuck off!
[216:02.68]Did you guys not hear- did you guys not hear the car?
[216:08.47]That was- that was beefing at the car.
[216:15.01]Did you guys didn't hear that?
[216:15.99]Ooh!
[216:33.78]You guys didn't hear the car?
[216:34.86]Alright.
[216:44.67]Bingo.
[216:45.23]First try.
[216:45.85]Don't fuck it up.
[216:46.77]Go.
[216:51.91]You ain't never seen anybody go fucking as fast as you're gonna see me go right now.
[217:09.24]what oh my god I don't know what happened there why did that happen hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry
[217:42.47]Which town in America, though?
[217:43.29]Which one?
[217:45.31]Tell us.
[217:47.07]We want to know as loyal viewers.
[217:48.39]Which one?
[217:49.63]What town is it?
[218:03.38]Just go over the... Just do it normal.
[218:05.10]NORMAL?! !
[218:06.61]I'm normal.
[218:10.09]I'm normal, okay?
[218:11.37]Get out of the way.
[218:12.57]Highly- Easy as pie.
[218:24.01]The number, that is.
[218:47.24]Welcome back, everybody.
[218:50.68]Sorry that, like, 500 of you left.
[218:54.27]As I press the alt-tab button to put a fucking cape on my body.
[218:58.99]Maybe if I just wasn't sitting here without clothes on, I could just press the camera turn on button.
[219:10.16]Across the road and onto the sidewalk.
[219:16.45]What's up there?
[219:27.98]Yeah, I was so dist- I was so sad!
[219:30.32]I was angry, but sad.
[219:32.83]Sad angry.
[219:33.57]Not even like upset angry.
[219:34.75]Because I'm like, I want to play this game.
[219:36.75]And I almost just almost lost it.
[219:38.85]Forever!
[219:42.05]Show dick!
[219:44.56]Don't make me turn this camera on.
[219:55.05]What's in here?
[220:02.31]Where am I?
[220:02.83]Coint!
[220:07.51]It worked!
[220:08.87]Ooh, wait.
[220:10.09]Is there a new, uh, clothes?
[220:28.11]Normal.
[220:28.53]Because I am.
[220:38.47]What are you doing out there?
[220:41.35]Not Millhouse.
[220:42.27]Grillhouse?
[220:44.20]Billhouse.
[220:44.74]What's that guy's name?
[220:46.22]Ralph.
[220:54.64]So hungry.
[220:55.84]Need federally mandated breakfast.
[220:58.62]He's not out here.
[221:07.79]Pump it.
[221:09.63]Wait, what's that?
[221:11.61]Oh, it's just a... It's one of those... One, two, three, four, five, six sided die.
[221:19.72]On three sides.
[221:25.67]I need to get this card again.
[221:26.95]Fast.
[221:27.05]I'm not gonna stop.
[221:32.99]Just do it quick.
[221:33.79]It's right here.
[221:34.63]And then the gag is right there too.
[221:36.85]Here we go.
[221:37.79]Quickly.
[221:49.04]He doesn't even need to see where he's going.
[221:55.29]Officer Jacks is on the case.
[222:15.75]Alright.
[222:18.73]We are now up to date.
[222:26.29]Camp Krusty.
[222:28.23]Ooh, what are you doing here?
[222:34.46]What's this?
[222:35.26]Can we see the beer again?
[222:36.88]I am never going to alt-tab for the rest of my life.
[222:39.02]School bus.
[222:39.52]Yeah, sure, why not?
[222:56.98]This is distracting.
[223:07.17]I don't like the lights in the back, and I don't like the transparency on top.
[223:16.80]Safe!
[223:27.89]Okay.
[223:28.55]I don't know.
[223:36.55]Talk to Pooh.
[223:37.57]Hey, Pooh.
[223:38.57]Come here.
[223:39.13]I'm not going to say it again.
[223:40.79]Stop it.
[223:54.92]To meet the meat eaters, hit and collect meat from Cletus's truck before time runs out.
[223:59.27]One, two, three, four.
[223:59.77]Get off of me.
[224:00.57]The giant crowbar just ruined everything.
[224:28.27]There's a meat!
[224:29.95]Where's the meat?
[224:33.77]I just got so baited again.
[224:54.61]Yuck.
[224:55.68]Yucky!
[224:56.42]Does that count for me?
[224:58.02]It does.
[224:58.40]No, his cards aren't gonna explode, man.
[225:02.38]Come on!
[225:22.25]Come on!
[225:22.91]Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.
[225:25.51]Come on!
[225:26.01]Yee-haw!
[225:28.35]Come on, Gwen.
[225:30.31]300 horses of convenience?
[225:34.01]Come on, Gwen.
[225:36.17]What?
[225:36.71]No.
[225:38.18]I'd move if I were you.
[225:44.82]Playtesses, bring in the pain.
[225:52.91]That was pretty cool.
[225:55.77]But Bart's still missing, and I'm no closer to finding him.
[225:58.96]Oh, we gotta go.
[225:59.46]Perhaps you should consult Professor Frink at the observatory.
[226:02.24]He seems to know everything, except why I ever came to this jerk Waterberg.
[226:10.44]I just drove on the wrong side of the road.
[226:11.56]That wasn't even my fault.
[226:26.06]Don't cut me off.
[226:37.89]Wait, I probably could have driven up, but it's okay.
[226:42.77]What just happened?
[226:45.85]That was a I died sound.
[226:55.88]Action!
[226:56.28]Karma sounds sad.
[226:57.84]I'm alright now.
[226:59.12]I was very sad earlier.
[227:30.45]I like the saxophone.
[227:34.12]That's pretty cute.
[227:37.71]This is so cute.
[227:39.01]Grandpa, can you help me find Bart?
[227:41.20]He's missing.
[227:42.16]Maybe I'm just a senile old man, but Bart's lucky red hat fell out of that black car.
[227:47.16]Wow, Grandpa, what a great clue.
[227:49.60]You showed why senior citizens are valuable members of the community.
[227:53.52]I think my baby teeth are growing back.
[227:55.88]That's why I had to punch that nurse.
[227:58.12]I better use something big if I want to take that car out.
[228:02.44]Like that school bus.
[228:05.73]Destroy the black sedans to find a clue.
[228:08.07]Don't let time run out.
[228:09.15]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[228:16.52]Can't jump off that.
[228:21.18]Nope.
[228:22.98]I do get the school bus, though.
[228:26.34]Maybe a soy pop would perk me up.
[228:28.12]Good.
[228:28.64]Good.
[228:29.80]Good.
[228:49.45]Dude.
[228:59.69]Dude, get out of my way.
[229:05.63]I gotta go.
[229:07.05]I gotta get out of here.
[229:18.17]Why is everybody spamming, I gotta go?
[229:26.76]Ken, why are you still alive?
[229:31.62]Oh, Lisa said it.
[229:37.58]What do I think of the movie Pixels?
[229:44.00]I didn't see the movie Pixels.
[229:45.04]It's probably the Adam Sandler movie.
[229:49.03]I didn't see it.
[229:50.93]I don't have an opinion on that movie.
[229:52.91]Why would I see that movie?
[230:06.74]Pac-Man is in that movie.
[230:08.10]Yeah, so is Adam Sandler.
[230:09.66]Now, that was efficient.
[230:20.62]Is that Homer?
[230:25.06]But so is Pac-Man.
[230:27.50]But so is Adam Sandler.
[230:44.75]Adam Sandler's not that bad.
[230:50.44]You know, he's just a dope.
[230:51.24]Oh, no!
[230:51.54]Oh, no!
[231:01.60]You have a gift for speed.
[231:03.85]Great.
[231:04.59]More liberal guilt.
[231:09.57]What the heck were you thinking?
[231:16.78]I'm gonna have to do so much babysitting to pay for that.
[231:21.30]420, 420, 420.
[231:22.38]Oh no, he went over that number, I think.
[231:24.39]It's funny.
[231:35.48]Look out!
[231:42.24]Adam Sandler is not Nicolas Cage.
[231:45.66]What, you think they're the same person?
[231:50.72]Alright, I only have 25 seconds.
[232:04.90]Can you... Why can you... My goodness.
[232:07.62]Drive to the casino.
[232:14.81]But... There's a race over here.
[232:19.25]One of them talks like this.
[232:21.99]You know what I'm saying?
[232:22.69]Nicolas Cage talks like this.
[232:26.53]Unfortunately... No, I'm doing... I'm doing... Nick... What's his name?
[232:29.32]Nick Offerman.
[232:30.44]The guy from Parks and Rec.
[232:34.06]Now let me tell you, as a man, as an American, I... Hi, Nelson.
[232:44.24]This is a surprise.
[232:50.19]Yeah, Ron Smonson.
[232:51.01]That's like Nick Stevenson.
[232:52.49]Nick Offerman?
[232:53.43]What's his name?
[232:53.77]Three, two, loser says what?
[232:55.91]What?
[232:56.73]Ha ha!
[232:58.05]One, go!
[233:07.06]But his name is not Ron Swanson in real life.
[233:11.33]Why?
[233:11.61]I'm not getting a ha-ha right now.
[233:14.49]Don't even think about it.
[233:16.47]I'm very fragile right now.
[233:17.73]I almost just all tabbed out of the whole world.
[233:23.25]Wow, my hair.
[233:25.47]I never underachieve at anything.
[233:28.14]So this is what it feels like to fall behind.
[233:33.93]It's not haha for you, it's haha for Nelson.
[233:39.69]Why?
[233:40.01]I'm here with the school bus.
[233:42.63]For some reason.
[233:43.31]I already did this one!
[233:45.15]I already did this one.
[233:47.30]I think that this is before the alt-tab.
[233:52.30]Ohhh.
[234:09.16]I'm not gonna... What?
[234:18.81]Did I just... What happened?
[234:22.77]That was really weird.
[234:30.76]What do I think of rocks?
[234:31.58]Or what does Ron Swanson think of rocks?
[234:34.70]Well... I do kind of like rocks.
[234:38.26]A little.
[234:39.77]I hope kids at home don't imitate my hitchhiking.
[234:46.73]Taking it to the streets.
[234:54.88]Hi, Nelson.
[234:55.72]This is a surprise.
[235:00.26]Three, two, one.
[235:01.36]I'm just doing Jorah Mormont.
[235:16.84]Hmm.
[235:19.68]Alright.
[235:22.23]I fucking restart this stupid race.
[235:24.55]I already beat this.
[235:32.87]It's not even fair.
[235:48.14]I already won.
[235:50.02]This guy is doing this on purpose.
[235:52.86]What are you all doing?
[235:54.84]What are you doing?
[235:56.58]Why would you do what you just did?
[235:59.38]What are you doing?
[236:04.65]What are you doing?
[236:06.91]This person's not supposed to be in first place.
[236:12.43]Ever.
[236:13.23]This is not happening.

[236:21.57]She's so mad.
[236:31.12]I gotta catch up.
[236:46.52]That was pretty good, too, but you can't even control it.
[236:58.87]Yeah, I know.
[236:59.43]I understand that I am losing to the sedan AI.
[237:01.94]I know, but, like, something really weird happened.

[240:49.05]How many strikes do you have so far?
[240:51.62]No strikes.
[240:52.40]But that's only because I'm a very, very bad cop.
[240:56.46]Now, first of all, if we're gonna go undercover, you will need a disguise.
[241:00.42]You mean like an eye patch?
[241:02.12]Hey, good one.
[241:03.24]If we could afford a disguise like that, I wouldn't be getting paid in potato chip coupons.

[256:40.33]Aye, he was in a long black limo, and ahoy, thar she drove.
[256:46.29]Took me hours to finish this when I was young.
[256:50.54]Get her to the black limo to find Bart.
[256:52.28]Let's just do this thing.
[256:53.50]I have need for speed, car speed.
[257:01.72]Doesn't seem like the right car for this.

[257:04.94]How did you just turn that around, Elvin?
[257:29.27]Into the water!
[257:29.97]Get into the water!
[257:33.15]I'm losing this fight.
[257:39.08]What kind of limo is this?
[257:47.44]Strongest damn limo I've ever seen.
[257:56.52]Dropping frames.
[257:59.58]Oh, crap.
[258:01.08]It's alright.
[258:06.22]It'll pass.
[258:10.00]Usually does.
[258:10.58]My car is gonna blow up before this does.
[258:27.61]Give me that wrench.
[258:28.73]I'm only halfway there.
[258:30.47]How am I gonna do this?
[258:32.91]I need another car for this.
[258:38.23]That was full speed.
[258:39.65]I'm gonna push you into a wall or something.
[258:50.41]Drive him into the wall!
[258:51.73]Into the wall!
[258:52.83]Into the wall!
[258:56.75]If I see a phone I'm getting out
[259:32.30]There we go.
[259:34.92]How are you on top of my car?
[259:39.92]Yeah, I'll be alright though.
[259:41.20]I'm good, I'm good.
[259:41.94]I don't need a phone.
[259:46.23]You have to drive him into the walls.
[259:49.53]Like this.
[259:49.91]You have to stay behind him.
[259:52.51]Yeah, there we go.
[259:55.55]Just keep the momentum behind him and he will drive into walls.
[260:02.51]See?
[260:03.23]Lisa knows what I'm talking about.
[260:05.83]One more.
[260:06.03]Right into the wall.
[260:06.59]Into the wall.
[260:07.29]Come on.
[260:29.97]Right there, bang.
[260:31.41]That's not enough.
[260:43.26]Drive into something!
[260:45.48]Drive into something.
[260:54.29]I'm being towed!
[260:56.29]Ah!
[261:14.94]I have no idea how hard that was to keep that up.
[261:19.32]Alright, let's see.
[261:33.95]Captain?
[261:35.67]Went down the wrong tube.
[261:37.41]Sorry.
[261:38.23]Alright.

[261:52.40]He ate his pant?
[261:55.30]He ate pants.
[261:57.92]Alright, what's next?
[262:01.72]Oh, God.
[262:02.44]I destroyed the limo and killed Bart.
[262:07.57]No, murderer ye be.
[262:09.31]He wasn't in the limo.
[262:10.91]He got out and he boarded that ship.
[262:13.31]Can you take me there?
[262:14.75]Nah, I hate the sea.
[262:23.70]What are you doing?
[262:24.20]Get out of the way.
[262:47.03]It's timed!
[262:48.63]Oh no!
[262:50.19]What?
[262:51.23]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[262:53.71]I was just... Okay, I'm good.
[262:55.43]What happened?
[262:55.91]Did I get Bard?
[262:56.61]Did I find Bard?
[262:58.20]I found him!
[263:03.92]Holy shit!
[263:08.96]Alright, I found Bard.
[263:12.71]It's fine.
[263:15.43]What?
[263:21.37]What's going on?
[263:22.19]Where's Bart?
[263:24.03]Where does this want me to go?
[263:26.44]In the boat?
[263:46.57]The arrow stops here.
[263:47.63]I gotta go to the other side?
[263:49.39]Can I make this jump?
[264:00.30]There's a ramp?
[264:02.64]Did I miss the ramp on the other side?
[264:03.86]Time to move!
[264:07.82]This is the worst town in America.
[264:12.39]Hey!
[264:13.57]Eyes on the road, jerk!
[264:19.24]Where is this thing?
[264:21.72]There it is.
[264:22.44]Bart?
[264:25.52]Bart?
[264:48.22]This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
[264:52.07]Looks like I'm not at 88%... Hello, Springfield!
[264:58.75]Darn it!
[265:01.51]Oh no, this is not good.
[265:06.05]Where was the ramp on the other side?
[265:07.45]I just, I drove around in a circle.
[265:09.65]Did I, I missed it when I was on the way up?
[265:12.63]Oh, goddammit.
[265:14.06]How'd you like a newspaper upside your head?
[265:19.28]You know what, like, just get... For the love of God.
[265:22.54]I'm gonna do this in five seconds.
[265:51.85]Sweet forward momentum!
[265:54.49]Ow, my hair!
[265:56.02]Or not.
[265:56.30]You just have 500,000 health.
[265:57.06]Ow, my hair!
[265:59.28]Time to move!
[266:22.61]Right into the wall.
[266:29.47]Sorry, sorry.
[266:36.70]Crash.
[266:40.88]I hope those were recyclable.
[266:52.47]They made this way too tough to kill this thing.
[266:59.08]It just has too much health.
[267:09.76]A child could do this?
[267:10.84]No, no, no, no!
[267:12.64]Remember the person in chat that said this mission took them like seven hours?
[267:18.96]No, this is not a...
[267:22.30]Get out of the way.
[267:29.38]No, and I'm looking at fucking chat.
[267:34.32]Yeah, as a child.
[267:35.32]Do you know how hard these old fucking games from like the 2000, 1998 era are?
[267:43.53]They're so hard.
[267:45.21]They're incredibly hard.
[267:46.99]They're difficult video games.
[267:52.69]Go load up Donkey Kong Country!
[267:54.90]I guarantee you rage quit after the first world.
[268:10.58]Alright, so where is this jump?
[268:16.01]If I follow the arrows here...
[268:20.16]The arrows are pointing me to go this way.
[268:22.08]Why?
[268:23.04]But then they stop.
[268:33.33]Why would the arrows tell me to go this way if I don't have to go this way?
[268:45.74]That doesn't make... Why are they on the ground there?
[268:51.57]Was I actually in the right spot last time?
[268:53.60]Like in here?
[268:54.14]Who are these people?
[268:56.98]Whee!
[269:02.42]Just hold on.
[269:03.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[269:04.13]Hold on a second.
[269:05.29]So do not follow the arrows on the ground, which for the entire, entire video game, it points you in the right direction to where you're supposed to drive.
[269:27.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[269:28.43]Right there.
[269:29.17]I just, I don't see it.
[269:36.81]I'm serious.
[269:38.25]Like, over here?
[269:39.51]Where is this?
[269:40.45]I know it's right there, but how do I get in there?
[269:50.64]just drive this way oh my fucking god well it's not even pointing me in the right direction the arrows didn't even remotely go this way I can do it
[270:16.18]Oh my fucking god, no!
[270:18.54]No, god!
[270:19.68]I can do it with a jump!
[270:22.62]Bart!
[270:27.00]Where is he?
[270:28.60]Bart!
[270:32.90]He didn't tell me to go- whatever.
[270:58.53]All I can do is take you home and get you a diaper.
[271:01.45]Yay!
[271:01.53]I won!
[271:02.51]I won!
[271:02.87]I won!
[271:18.80]They didn't- I know I did that jump before, but the arrows to get there weren't point- I thought I had to go a different way!
[271:25.42]Why wouldn't the arrows point, like, to go over the ramp?
[271:30.37]Oh.
[271:39.17]Alright, I get to be Marge now.
[271:40.03]Ah, a leprechaun.
[271:48.16]Wait, let me play with the TV.
[271:48.90]From a prisoner named Skateboarding Glory,
[272:00.51]What is wrong with Bart?
[272:01.53]Yeah, something's wrong with his... I think the game might be fucked up.
[272:04.95]You hear him?
[272:28.45]He's like, blah, blah, blah.
[272:29.25]I think the audio fucked up.
[272:34.81]Everyone better stay out of my way.
[272:42.47]Oh, my goodness.
[272:43.47]Why is Marge running like this?
[272:51.24]Easy come, easy go.
[272:57.35]Pull up!
[272:57.83]Am I on the final family member?
[273:12.22]Is this the last chapter of the game?
[273:32.69]Alright, I did it.
[273:38.01]Now I gotta talk to you.
[273:38.91]Chief Wiggum, I need you to find out what happened to Bart.
[273:43.06]Could you show me where the crop circle is?
[273:45.94]There's got to be a clue to curing Bart.
[273:49.38]Ah, that's cute.
[273:50.58]I'd love to help, but I got sugar withdrawal real bad.
[273:53.62]The donut store is closed, and I got a monkey on my back screaming for Cruller.
[273:58.59]Oh, oh, he's screaming.
[274:02.99]Oh, God.
[274:04.75]Hit the donut truck to get the donuts.
[274:06.08]I need ten donuts.
[274:07.14]Starting now.
[274:12.96]We're gonna first try missions here.
[274:14.56]I can't do any more scream missions where I scream.
[274:17.44]Look away, people!
[274:21.56]Nothing to see!
[274:31.71]Hey.
[274:32.69]Thanks for the donut!
[274:51.91]Uh, it's not gonna happen.
[274:59.30]Not this late.
[275:24.94]No, I'm not.
[275:27.24]I'm not.
[275:31.90]They give you plenty of time for this one.
[275:34.91]I'm so glad.
[275:35.97]Oh my god, I would be like, what the fuck?
[275:37.67]You know what I mean?
[275:38.11]I'd be like, what the fuck?
[275:39.83]Let's get a stupid fuck!
[275:42.97]Oh my goodness.
[275:48.84]Oh.
[275:51.88]How's that for a turnaround?
[276:12.43]No, I didn't want the camera to change.
[276:13.87]I wanted to be able to see where I was going.
[276:20.90]Oh, man.
[276:38.13]Oh, man.
[276:40.77]Oh, man.
[276:41.47]Oh, get... Alright.
[276:42.37]My whole body just almost exploded.
[276:45.04]I want a new costume for March.
[277:11.76]I had one for Homer.
[277:13.72]Had one for Lisa.
[277:14.98]Had two for Lisa.
[277:17.54]Let me take a look.
[277:28.13]I need some money.
[277:29.01]I need money.
[277:29.67]I need like 300, 400, 500.
[277:31.25]Something like that.
[277:34.03]What is her attack?
[277:37.55]You want to know what the best Simpsons video game ever made is?
[277:43.94]And I kind of wish I could play it.
[277:44.94]I wonder if there's a way to play it.
[277:46.92]The... Remember The Simpsons arcade game?
[277:53.79]That game was amazing.
[277:58.31]To beat him up.
[278:01.39]That was probably the best Simpsons video game ever.
[278:05.23]What about that side?
[278:08.77]Is there a card?
[278:09.59]There's a card over there.
[278:13.69]I wonder if I can make it from here.
[278:17.17]Not really.
[278:17.59]This is going to be a tough jump.
[278:22.67]Didn't even... Whatever.
[278:23.67]Goodbye.
[278:28.62]There's a version of a 360?
[278:29.60]Is there really?
[278:30.46]That's actually awesome.
[278:36.86]Alright.
[278:37.18]Inmate Marge.
[278:39.32]Classy Marge.
[278:40.24]Or Police Marge.
[278:42.66]I only have 300 coins.
[278:43.60]I need 400 for Police Marge.
[278:58.56]Not enough.
[279:00.50]I'll save it.
[279:04.02]Speaking of saving it...
[279:17.04]Alright.
[279:19.26]So... I can start collecting money.
[279:32.03]Save Millhouse.
[279:39.48]Save Millhouse.
[279:40.36]Kill Millhouse.
[279:41.42]Why would you want me to do something like that?
[279:43.44]Millhouse is a great, great young lad.
[280:06.40]There is a race available.
[280:08.52]I didn't do the other ones, but I need to do the three races.
[280:11.00]I have to.
[280:11.54]What is that car?
[280:32.12]Alright, do I get that for doing the three races?
[280:35.72]How am I ever gonna compete with this?
[280:41.64]Oh.
[280:43.20]Like that, apparently.
[280:45.27]Uh... I was going too fast.
[280:55.51]The SUV, you can't turn it very, very well.
[281:01.08]If I do that again, I might be able to do it.
[281:05.41]This is not the right car for this.
[281:13.63]No.
[281:16.34]Mm-mm.
[281:20.74]Not gonna happen.
[281:32.61]Clown car.
[281:38.08]There's a lot of cars, huh?
[281:42.94]Sedan is probably the best one.
[281:44.74]Or Lisa's car.
[281:46.18]And Lisa's gonna drive.
[282:04.62]How do you get the clown car?
[282:07.71]We were promised a clown car.
[282:13.95]Well, how do I unlock it?
[282:20.35]You gotta buy it.
[282:21.85]How much is it?
[282:34.17]It's not 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
[282:39.62]He's still playing this?
[282:40.58]Yeah.
[282:41.76]I'm probably going to complete it tonight.
[282:46.40]I can't start Simpsons Hit and Run and not finish it.
[282:51.95]He thinks he's gonna do it.
[282:54.41]Uh... Oh yeah, I was gonna do that.
[282:56.17]I was gonna try this.
[282:56.91]It's a minimum of 11 hours.
[283:18.35]Well... Is it?
[283:18.71]6, 12, 1, go!
[283:34.34]Alright, straight through.
[283:35.04]I don't want to go too fast, because... That's why, but I'm in first still.
[283:43.69]Alright, now stay in first.
[283:45.88]Holy shit, this car is so fast.
[283:47.36]Yeah.
[283:54.50]How am I gonna keep in front of you?
[284:00.84]What?
[284:01.60]Marge?
[284:06.95]You went over that and it turned out it was a bad idea.
[284:12.97]I gotta hit every one of these, like, secret jumps.
[284:15.92]Ahhhh!
[284:21.01]I'm not ready for this one.
[284:30.43]That car's too good.
[284:32.67]I need the Clown Cop before I can come back.
[284:40.44]Try it one more time.
[284:49.28]I have to beat all these to get the clown car.
[284:54.18]Uh, Rotten Fresh just gave $50.
[284:55.60]Hey, Jerma, I just got a job.
[284:57.40]Wanted to give back.
[284:58.18]There's people that meant the most.
[285:00.32]So here I am.
[285:01.00]Plus, I loved this game when I was a kid.
[285:02.95]Enjoy.
[285:05.15]Thank you so much, Rotten.
[285:06.85]For your $50.
[285:07.21]Your huge $50.
[285:07.67]Thank you.
[285:18.51]That means a lot.
[285:19.87]I hope Bart gets blamed for that.
[285:23.98]50 bucks.
[285:27.04]I hope these are recyclable.
[285:29.00]I hit the fucking corner on the way down.
[285:31.36]How'd you do that?
[285:34.96]Yeah.
[285:37.31]Congratulations on the... Oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[285:40.61]Is there a... Is there a skip right here?
[285:44.25]Is this a skip?
[285:44.85]I am so embarrassed right now.
[285:55.86]Nice skip.
[285:58.42]Not a skip.
[286:00.10]I wish Marge would just sit down.
[286:13.13]That doesn't really do anything for me.
[286:14.29]I feel like I shouldn't even do that one.
[286:22.72]Which is so much faster than me.
[286:30.73]Ooh.
[286:32.83]He screwed up, though.
[286:39.17]Nah, he can go over that grass better than I can.
[286:44.11]Eugh.
[286:58.40]No.
[286:59.00]No.
[287:01.52]No.
[287:02.30]I think I need a better car.
[287:04.84]I think I need to come in with a faster or better handling car.
[287:07.32]There's so many twists and turns and... That car is just twice as fast as mine.
[287:20.51]Gonna take more shortcuts?
[287:21.39]Well, I have to memorize where the shortcuts are and that is not gonna happen.
[287:29.23]I can guarantee you that.
[287:34.67]I hope these aren't recyclable.
[287:37.96]This is so humiliating.
[287:40.26]You won't like me when I'm angry.
[287:48.13]What a letdown.
[287:49.49]Come on.
[287:51.49]Smashy smashy.
[287:55.78]We both just- Holy shit, he fucked it all up.
[287:58.16]Come on.
[287:58.52]Pay attention.
[287:58.88]No!
[288:21.35]He went over the thing.
[288:22.48]Whatever the giant thing.
[288:23.60]I don't know what it was.
[288:24.50]He's doing every single.
[288:25.80]You have to hit every single shortcut.
[288:27.50]I just don't know where they are.
[288:30.72]God damn it.
[288:31.66]You have to hit every single shortcut.
[288:35.49]I had it.
[288:36.17]I don't even know what I fucking hit there.
[288:39.23]No.
[288:40.03]He's taking all the shortcuts.
[288:55.85]It's not even a race!
[288:58.30]It's just cheating!
[289:00.38]This is not a race, this is who can cheat better!
[289:03.58]Which one of you two can take the cheat codes better?
[289:11.55]Shazbot!
[289:14.09]Great!
[289:14.79]More liberal guilt!
[289:16.33]Send the bill to Homer!
[289:25.93]No, I'm done.
[289:26.63]No thanks.
[289:27.17]No thanks.
[289:28.73]No, no thank you.
[289:29.83]Nope.
[289:30.31]Nope.
[289:59.78]Sorry about that.
[290:18.91]Mr. Guy, what are you doing here?
[290:21.33]Well, I've been trying to convince Agnes to come make fun of schoolchildren, but she refuses to go out with me.
[290:27.09]That son of hers keeps intercepting every gift I send her and hides them at his workplace.
[290:32.09]He's a jerk and a fool.
[290:33.69]Why not just go get them back?
[290:35.49]I would, but... Well, I'm not a terribly mobile person.
[290:39.51]There, I said it.
[290:41.01]Oh, I know.
[290:42.35]It's not easy being husky.
[290:45.16]I know, hold on, just give me a second.
[290:47.74]Wait till the cutscene's over.
[290:49.00]I have to alt-tab.
[290:49.64]Save the goddamn game.
[291:22.38]Alright, it's saved.
[291:23.04]Okay.
[291:28.44]Here we go.
[291:31.00]I don't know why my Streamlabs is minimized.
[291:33.94]I don't know why the hell that happened.
[291:37.74]It's actually gone.
[291:38.48]Why is it gone?
[291:39.06]Uh, that's weird.
[291:56.12]Did I like X out of the window?
[291:57.44]No, I had it up.
[291:59.26]That's very weird.
[292:05.55]Alright.
[292:07.11]Now I can see.
[292:16.37]So we had huge money.
[292:22.42]We had $50 from Lightning Rider.
[292:24.44]You can be here.
[292:25.09]I believe in you.
[292:25.73]I'm sorry that that's not true.
[292:29.07]Thank you so much for the $50.
[292:29.91]I wasn't going to spend the next two hours trying to do it.
[292:37.35]Sometimes you've got to accept when you can't do something.
[292:41.56]I'd rather just enjoy the game.
[292:43.36]Who's holding the fucking horn down?
[292:47.66]Okay, apparently I was.
[292:50.71]It's a blank screen.
[292:52.75]Shouldn't be.
[293:09.53]Why are you doing this now?
[293:14.22]I think I'm going to have to restart the game.
[293:16.38]Yes, I am.
[293:27.55]Let's try it again.
[293:34.20]Okay, come on back.
[294:00.07]I had it saved right there, so we're fine.
[294:01.55]Resume game.
[294:04.41]But no, Lightning Rider, thank you so much.
[294:05.91]50 fucking dollars, and then... There were 20 community subs.
[294:15.88]From... How long ago was that?
[294:19.80]Was that from Great Canadian?
[294:32.24]Excuse me?
[294:33.46]I don't care if you is from New York.
[294:35.80]You ain't taking pictures of our decrepitude for no magazine, no way.
[294:41.27]No, Cletus, it's me, Marge.
[294:44.51]But that's $50 as well, so thank you so much, guys.
[294:51.33]There's been, like, three or four $50 donations, and then, like, a bunch of subs to... Thank you.
[294:57.99]Uh... What am I... Uh, I wasn't paying any attention to that.
[295:05.44]I gotta hit you and then pick up your stuff that falls out of your trunk.
[295:14.46]What the hell is going on with this game?
[295:21.79]Oh, dear.
[295:22.89]Sure hope no one saw that.
[295:30.91]Was it dropping?
[295:31.91]I'm gonna lose him.
[295:43.60]Oh, man.
[295:44.00]It's getting close for me to break my controller in half.
[295:49.80]Marge Simpson.
[295:55.17]There it goes!
[296:04.13]Oh, I did it!
[296:04.89]I made a switch control, are you serious?
[296:08.69]Comfy, pretty comfy.
[296:16.75]Oh, I just had that thing done.
[296:31.96]Alright.
[296:50.25]Can you drop another one?
[296:53.23]Or do I have to ram ya?
[296:57.31]Why would I bring the biggest car in here?
[297:21.08]Where are you going?
[297:21.80]No, don't go down.
[297:28.48]I'm on two wheels.

[312:36.99]Who needs a clown car when you have this?
[312:49.84]This is my new car.

[313:23.61]Race with that thing?
[313:26.91]Well, I was wondering if you've ever seen a crop circle.
[313:30.45]Talk to Abe.
[313:31.93]He mentioned crop circles once.
[313:34.25]Hurry up and get to the home before the police lock the doors.
[313:39.95]Race Chief Wiggum to the retirement castle.
[313:42.48]Everyone better stay

[313:49.17]Ah, I didn't go there, sorry.
[314:05.04]This thing's actually kind of making me freak.
[314:06.77]This is, like, hurting my brain.

[314:36.89]Oh my, really?
[314:38.35]You shouldn't enjoy that.
[314:41.72]Okay.
[314:41.84]Maybe I shouldn't pick this thing.
[314:48.04]I'll do my best.
[314:50.40]I'll try this one more time.
[314:51.52]Let's do this thing.

[320:21.23]I'll do my best.
[320:23.20]You just realized you've been doing the same four missions the whole game?
[320:26.62]I think I just realized that right now.
[320:31.12]Am I actually just coming to that realization right now?
[320:49.93]Oh my goodness, that was so fast!
[320:57.83]Let's try it again.

[324:22.36]Okay, Grandpa.
[324:26.19]Alright, dude, you seriously suck at this game.
[324:28.01]Play an easier game, dude.
[324:29.21]I don't think Simpsons Hit and Run is the one for you.
[324:31.13]Uh, I... I should say that I've put at least 2,000 hours into this game and it's more complicated than this.
[324:37.30]Alright, that's... Okay.
[324:37.86]You're a crazy medicine, Grandpa.
[324:41.60]Why?

[326:37.66]A planet with an antenna?
[326:41.22]That sounds awfully familiar.
[326:43.96]I think it was at the Quicking War.
[326:46.33]That's it.
[326:47.27]It was on a bottle of pop.
[326:49.51]Maybe that will jog Bart's memory.
[326:54.93]Marge in charge.
[327:02.39]Now I wish I had insurance.
[327:10.57]Move it or lose it, Buster.

[328:48.58]What's going on here?
[328:50.24]In the backyard?
[328:58.29]The door was blinking.

[330:05.70]No, come on.
[330:06.80]Give me a little bit of credit here.
[330:09.52]I'm playing an old 2000s game that's very hard, that's considered one of the hardest video games of the last century.
[330:16.65]And I'm talking, yeah, back when fucking Sottles Tease, whatever his name was, the guy, the Caesar, that was putting people inside of a fucking dome and making them fight each other.
[330:26.83]I'm talking harder than that.
[330:30.12]Dude, you seriously suck at this game.
[330:33.22]Do something easier.
[330:44.70]I have I'm going to the arcade 2000 hours in this game goes all the way to the top I need a little extra firepower as officer marge serve and protect purchase marge's police uniform with the quickie Bart's room or I mean there it is I don't have enough

[331:27.28]Why is everybody yelling bathroom?
[331:40.71]Enough?
[331:41.39]No.
[331:41.55]I have to steal money from fucking Flanders.
[331:47.14]Hold L and R and press A, B. I'm not cheating.
[331:49.64]No, I'm beating this game.
[331:51.94]Legitimate money.
[332:05.22]I got enough money.
[332:06.74]I'm good to go.
[332:12.00]Jerma, I have over 2000 sucks at this game.
[332:14.79]Why did I just read that?
[332:25.76]There's no reason for me to read what you just said.
[332:35.89]Look at your new outfit in the window.
[332:40.03]Run and collect all the evil Cola cans before time runs out.
[332:44.54]What?
[332:47.26]You mean out here?
[332:48.10]Is Marge on drugs?
[333:16.62]Should I be... I have to be blocking, right?
[333:25.74]How would I ever do this without... Go all... Cones!
[333:34.42]Get the coins.
[333:38.36]Did I miss any?
[333:41.17]I think I missed two.
[333:44.34]Where are these?
[333:45.84]Wait, is it, I can go, I can get them around, right?
[333:51.88]Get it!
[333:52.14]I don't, oh my god.
[334:05.97]I couldn't see where I was going.
[334:07.15]I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[334:11.91]You know, like, get these trees out of the way!
[334:16.86]Hold on a minute.
[334:17.60]Can I even... What?
[334:23.42]Okay, so I have to go, uh... I guess... It's still possible, maybe.
[334:33.96]Probably not, though.
[334:40.10]And I figured they were all in a line.
[334:42.47]Nah, I'm not gonna get it.
[334:51.19]No.
[334:52.53]So, for next time, where's the easy way for me to get up here?
[334:55.39]Is it around the building, or do I have to jump from, uh, it's over here.
[335:12.00]Ah, camera.
[335:13.72]Oh.
[335:15.67]I almost could have had it.
[335:31.66]I'm not allowed to fail the mission once to see where I need to go?
[335:37.46]Why?
[335:49.17]No, first try only!
[335:51.58]Only first try!
[335:52.98]Only!
[335:53.42]Alright, so then now I go from here... Can you please pick it up?
[336:20.99]Get the ones down here.
[336:24.55]That's two.
[336:28.91]Uh... Get a wraparound.
[336:37.45]I swear, I used to be a catarana.
[336:40.81]The running and the jumping is... Yeah!
[336:43.87]Yes!
[336:46.17]Yippee!
[337:02.34]I'm doing it wrong, but... oh man.
[337:05.27]I still can do it.
[337:14.99]I guess they'll get up there, I think.
[337:17.79]I'm just running in circles.
[337:19.31]Yeah, whatever.
[337:34.21]Can I get over there from here though?
[337:35.55]I don't even know the way to get over there.
[337:39.95]I really don't.
[337:41.19]Go up on the billboard.
[337:43.41]Ugh.
[338:32.38]Alright.
[338:42.28]Alright, Billboard.
[338:57.11]Get off.
[338:57.51]Get off of it, Marge.
[338:58.31]What are you doing?
[339:04.86]Get it?
[339:05.18]Come on.
[339:05.62]Oh, this is going right next to Bart's baby shoes.
[339:10.46]Yippee!
[339:31.44]Okay, Marge.
[339:32.02]Let's go.
[339:35.52]I need a Long Island iced tea.
[339:37.64]I'll bet half who knows who's selling cola.
[340:08.66]Apu, I think you should be aware that you're selling a tainted core.
[340:13.44]Where is this stuff coming from?
[340:15.30]There is little here not tainted in some way.
[340:17.68]Even the astrology scrolls give poor advice.
[340:20.43]But I will get to the bottom of this.
[340:22.33]Well, it made Bart go crazy.
[340:24.67]And if I find the distributor, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind.
[340:28.45]I will destroy them.
[340:29.33]I will try.
[340:29.93]Okay.
[340:30.19]Kill trucks.
[341:00.64]Slow and steady wins the race.
[341:02.49]Can I dump fucking toxic waste on him?
[341:07.27]Yeah, this is not the right vehicle for this.
[341:21.30]Am I gonna have to do the whole Marge thing?
[341:22.74]No, sit up, because I might have to do the whole stupid soda can thing again.
[341:26.91]Oh god, no.
[341:50.92]Gamer, sit up!
[341:52.18]Well, I'm not doing enough damage.
[342:19.87]Oh... Somehow, I pancaked him into the wall.
[342:23.72]Alright.
[342:24.62]Whatever.
[342:25.44]Let's go.
[342:44.76]Oh shit.
[342:45.40]Come here, loser!
[342:47.70]Get over here, loser!
[343:14.33]How's that not any damage?
[343:19.84]Alright, when he drives accidentally gently into the wall, it's more damage than flying off a goddamn cliff.
[343:31.26]Whoops.
[343:48.68]Into the wall.
[343:58.99]Yeah, I love the Tom Arnold music.
[344:02.21]No, that's an actor.
[344:03.07]What's his name?
[344:03.53]What the fuck are you doing?
[344:05.95]Why would you do that to me?
[344:15.22]I need you to drive into a wall.
[344:17.65]Or into another car or anything.
[344:20.07]Into this wall!
[344:22.31]Into something!
[344:24.75]Into the wall!
[344:26.23]Why does that not do any damage to you?
[344:34.50]Well, I don't know.
[344:35.18]Okay.
[344:37.18]That was two head-on car crashes.
[344:43.00]He got smashed into that car head-on.
[344:49.85]How did it blow up the first time?
[344:50.83]Because it bumped into a pole.
[345:04.19]It smacked its side into a little median and it destroyed it.
[345:15.98]I have to get a bigger car.
[345:18.00]Yeah, probably.
[345:19.38]The repo guys aren't gonna like that.
[345:21.56]I can't.
[345:22.16]This is just gonna get a little uptick.
[345:23.46]Just, hello, Superman.
[345:24.74]I'd like to fucking report a disturbance.
[345:31.11]Hi, sir.
[345:31.99]Could you give me a lift?
[345:48.02]Too bad he didn't use the clown car.
[345:49.55]I am.
[345:50.99]Just wait till he comes over here.
[345:55.31]Come on.
[345:58.22]It's true.
[346:00.14]Women drivers aren't very good.
[346:02.44]How'd you land a newspaper upside your head?
[346:13.80]Look at these full rams.
[346:16.14]Get that hoopty wig off the road!
[346:30.69]I'm not very good at this.
[346:55.01]Same- that was the same guy.
[346:57.39]He's gonna Dr- Am I gonna get credit for that?
[347:09.93]No, he's still alive.
[347:11.34]He's still alive.
[347:12.04]Yeah.
[347:12.68]Okay, great.
[347:13.64]That's fantastic.
[347:18.56]Just drove off the cliff into the ocean and he's still alive.
[347:26.78]Alright, he just... I don't... I don't understand.
[347:32.50]He just crashed like three times.
[347:33.62]Here comes another one.
[347:46.13]Maybe I can get... See?
[347:47.71]Where was the damage on that?
[347:49.39]He just drove straight into that guy.
[348:04.52]I'm not very good at this.
[348:08.04]I used to give my controller bite marks because of this game.
[348:17.68]Why do you keep hitting me?
[348:26.23]No, wait a second.
[348:34.01]That's so funny.
[348:35.89]Oh no, did I blow it?
[348:36.95]I'm gonna lose!
[348:40.04]Die!
[348:40.32]Fight marks.
[349:02.29]I just beat every mission.
[349:03.87]Oh, give it a rest, alright?
[349:07.31]No way!
[349:08.05]I don't believe you!
[349:09.52]I don't believe you for a minute!
[349:16.80]I see some of you guys in this chat with your mouths going... You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row.
[349:27.93]I know it!
[349:35.87]I'm certain of that.
[349:41.39]I mean, I didn't even have to say it.
[349:49.46]Somebody just talked about how they were biting things.
[350:01.83]Oh, come on.
[350:10.19]I have 2000 hours in it.
[350:25.02]No, this car is going to explode.
[350:26.52]I can't do it here.
[350:27.38]No, I don't want to bite anything.
[350:31.20]If this car explodes, I'm turning on the webcam and I'm biting something.
[350:58.42]Jerma how is it possible that you could be this bad?
[351:01.50]I
[351:05.91]Adam Sandler.
[351:34.45]Adam Sandler.
[351:36.57]Ugh.
[351:39.63]Jerba.
[351:40.11]I mean, look at me.
[351:46.60]Idiot.
[351:46.94]Now where do I go?
[351:47.68]How about that?
[352:10.41]Thirty whatever.
[352:15.29]Thirty percent?
[352:16.19]Did he get thirty percent?
[352:19.99]I don't... I can't, there's no noise I can even do.
[352:24.76]Thirty percent?
[352:25.74]I can't!
[352:27.38]I can't.
[352:28.70]Wait.
[352:29.52]New character?
[352:36.13]Nice.
[352:48.74]Armor truck, armor truck, armor truck.
[352:52.42]Jerva sucks, Jerva sucks, Jerva... Alright, I don't want to like keep pushing them.
[353:04.33]They stopped throwing rocks at my house!
[353:28.59]I hear like, this is what I hear right now.
[353:32.20]I hear like... Get her!
[353:38.02]They're throwing rocks at my house!
[353:40.42]Who's doing this?
[353:41.96]I open up my front door.
[353:42.90]You hit me in the mouth!
[353:46.31]And I close the door really fast.
[353:47.61]I got hit in the face with a rock.
[354:04.89]We got him cornered.
[354:07.65]What does he want me to do?
[354:09.15]300 horses of convenient power.
[354:10.94]I've got to hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me.
[354:21.36]I have been selling tainted cola.
[354:23.30]Unless I redeem myself, I will be reincarnated as a sea cucumber.
[354:26.82]Or worse, a land cucumber.
[354:29.53]I must find the source of this evil beverage.
[354:32.35]The soda invoice commanded I go here.
[354:34.57]They're just whipping rocks at my house.
[354:37.09]I look over and I'm like, what are they saying?
[354:40.41]I am the greatest driver in all the land.
[354:48.79]Follow the cola truck and collect all the evidence.
[354:50.47]Don't miss any cola.
[354:51.73]Collect cola.
[355:23.00]Is this the armoured truck thing that you guys are talking about?
[355:26.02]Holy shit.
[355:36.11]Will I know if it's the armoured truck level because will there be rocks thrown at my house?
[355:41.37]You know what I mean?
[355:42.01]What is that?
[355:42.43]Probably?
[355:50.92]Oh, okay.
[356:18.74]Clean up in aisle one.
[356:47.26]Talk to Louie at the legitimate business thing.
[356:48.69]I will later.
[356:50.07]Hello?
[356:50.39]I'll punch you in the vital areas.
[356:51.51]Don't come in here.
[356:52.11]We're making sausage.
[356:53.79]Van sausages.
[357:15.71]Hello stereotypical Italians.
[357:17.84]Pleased to tell me the source of the evil cola.
[357:20.06]We don't know nothing.
[357:21.82]Except that the vans are controlled by mysterious strangers.
[357:24.52]Anyway, you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business.
[357:27.92]It could come back to haunt you and your family.
[357:31.09]Oh my gosh.
[357:32.25]Your thinly veiled threat has reminded me of my fatherly duties.
[357:35.83]I'm supposed to pick up the octuplets at the doctor's.
[357:40.15]Drive to the hospital before time runs out.
[357:42.07]Avoid the mob.
[357:42.71]There's a time limit here.
[357:43.49]My God.
[357:43.67]And I gotta get away from the limo.
[357:44.79]I couldn't get away.
[357:45.95]It turned into my face.
[357:49.26]This is a good car.
[358:12.49]I'm popping away, here we go!
[358:23.88]Away from me.
[358:24.36]Did I lose him?
[358:27.16]Not yet.
[358:27.88]Fuck.
[358:28.30]Come on.
[358:29.26]I gotta lose you somewhere.
[358:37.20]I get a bangy U-turn.
[358:38.10]Oh, come on.
[358:39.54]Got it.
[359:04.22]I'm actually not sure what the hell I just did.
[359:05.27]To complete this mission, you will need Homer's custom-built car.
[359:33.96]purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot.
[359:37.08]500 coins.
[359:37.82]Or call it from a phone.
[359:38.92]How much money do I have?
[359:48.49]Well, thankfully there's bugs over here with money.
[359:50.97]500.
[359:52.67]I'm going to have to do some exploring.
[360:07.63]Hmm... I see... over here.
[360:10.45]Sick.
[360:23.23]Please drink water, it's been six hours.
[360:27.23]I haven't- I've been getting a dri- You guys don't really think I'm just sitting here like... HELP!
[360:34.87]HELP ME!
[360:36.23]HELP!
[360:36.59]DRY IT OUT!
[360:38.80]If you give me a ride, I will pay you a million dollars in the next life, I promise.
[360:47.64]This is not good for my insurance.
[360:49.46]What do we got?
[360:49.98]Over here?
[360:53.82]It's a couple of coins, and there's a wrench.
[360:55.73]I need way more than this.
[361:09.43]Well, we got another mission here.
[361:13.06]Excuse me, nice Mr. Shopkeeper person.
[361:16.08]Have you seen a hovering death machine?
[361:18.32]No, nothing specifically of the hovering kind, no.
[361:22.26]Oh, this was to be my greatest invention since sideburns in a can.
[361:27.17]They make you handsome and lovely.
[361:29.21]What are you talking about?
[361:30.25]I call it the hover car, TM.
[361:32.51]So don't try to steal the name, it's TM'd.
[361:34.91]I installed the onboard computer and it came alive and attacked my person.
[361:39.19]For the love of all that's gliding, you gotta help me here.
[361:41.83]Okay, what on Earth can I do?
[361:43.65]Knock the Flushig and the thing off the road before the authorities come and take me away again.
[361:49.06]Prisons ain't kind to pencil-neck geeks like myself.
[361:52.82]They stomp and they kick.
[361:55.87]Jerva died hours ago, we're just hearing the gases releasing.
[361:59.53]What?
[361:59.65]What are you talking about?
[362:24.85]Perhaps I should refrain from doing that.
[362:26.70]Oh, look!
[362:29.66]You fucked it up, didn't ya?
[362:31.50]An iron... Oh, never mind.
[362:39.95]Move it, Cracker!
[362:43.07]What are you trying to port with this crazy driving?
[362:46.57]What in the hell were you thinking?
[362:53.36]It's a Futurama reference.
[362:54.42]I know, when they squeeze on him and he goes... I've seen that video.
[362:58.50]I've seen that movie.
[362:59.96]I've seen that TV program.
[363:01.20]Stupid!
[363:32.49]That's not a shortcut.
[363:39.29]So I get this car.
[363:42.35]Don't you guys tell me?
[363:46.72]Move.
[363:57.13]Why are you pointing at every direction arrows?
[363:58.97]Move.
[364:02.23]Oh, no.
[364:04.79]No, no, no!
[364:08.00]I'm fine.
[364:23.97]Hey, Professor.
[364:25.13]How are you?
[364:26.17]Great work, my Hindu friend.
[364:28.31]Do not patronize my faith, OK?
[364:30.10]Sorry.
[364:30.62]Terribly sorry.
[364:32.18]Look, if you need a ride, instant message my cortex, by which I mean, call me.
[364:39.06]Thank you all for coming.
[364:40.56]I'll see you in hell.
[364:43.16]Professor Frank's hover car.
[364:44.18]Go to a phone booth to use it.
[364:50.65]Is it good?
[365:05.52]Damn.
[365:07.75]Can you hide all the spoilers?
[365:08.57]Uh, in the game?
[365:08.97]There are no spoilers.
[365:10.23]What are you talking about?
[365:27.24]Oh, that's right.
[365:27.62]I need 500 coins.
[365:28.14]Shit.
[365:28.94]Find them.
[365:59.14]I need a lot.
[366:00.10]Aye, okay.
[366:00.68]Up this way.
[366:01.12]Some coins.
[366:01.40]A few.
[366:01.72]I need to go explore.
[366:02.46]Looking for some kind of...
[366:29.84]Nah, I'm not close enough.
[366:31.30]Yes, I am.
[366:33.92]Am I?
[366:36.92]Am I enjoying the game?
[366:42.83]Uh, yeah.
[366:44.37]I think so.
[366:44.79]Let me know.
[366:55.75]Am I?
[366:56.57]I'm not?
[366:59.40]He's not.
[367:03.28]Why?
[367:03.56]Because I went... Something along those lines.
[367:09.32]And I said, someone rocks at me!
[367:13.76]I think that's what I remember saying.
[367:14.82]Oh, that was pretty badass.
[367:27.06]I need you.
[367:27.62]Come here.
[367:39.90]Did I go far enough?
[367:47.43]Can I even jump on this?
[367:48.45]It'd be just great if the camera could turn.
[367:59.56]I guess I can't go on that.
[368:01.94]Did I not get that going?
[368:20.49]Alright, there's probably a box up here.
[368:26.19]Or a bee?
[368:27.69]Any bees?
[368:30.09]I don't see a bee, and I don't... Oh, there we go.
[368:31.81]And there's a box up here.
[368:33.03]Good.
[368:33.43]500, right?
[368:41.65]And there's another bee.
[368:46.43]Good.
[368:48.35]Uh, come here.
[368:55.19]I don't want you to spill coins all over them.
[368:57.05]I'm not going to be able to get... What are you shooting at me?
[369:01.60]Okay.
[369:06.65]I shouldn't have bought all those dumb clothes.
[369:11.49]I'd have way more money.
[369:13.21]I'm not even close.
[369:16.32]Actually, I can go from here to there.
[369:26.42]Ah, interesting.
[369:27.51]Can I get up there still?
[369:28.61]Windowsill?
[369:32.75]No.
[369:35.17]Well, I need to get back on that roof.
[369:38.05]Can I do something on the other side?
[369:43.43]No.
[369:44.55]Mm-hmm.
[369:46.33]Nice jump, but I couldn't have made it.
[369:55.87]I could not have made it.
[369:59.75]I see you with a rock in your hand.
[370:00.73]Put it down.
[370:02.15]There's no reason for that.
[370:08.36]Let's see.
[370:12.66]Can I get up here?
[370:18.68]Let me see.
[370:22.17]Can I make it?
[370:23.07]I guess I can make it from here to there.
[370:24.67]Can I?
[370:31.83]There's that little ledge right here, but can I just make that?
[370:35.25]Am I lined up?
[370:40.77]It's like the claw machine.
[370:41.95]Okay.
[370:49.22]Oh, this side is more important.
[370:50.68]No!
[370:50.92]What the fuck?!
[370:53.02]What the fuck?!
[370:57.42]Uh, he just pushed me off.
[370:58.54]I didn't touch anything.
[371:07.17]I just kind of fell off.
[371:09.27]Well, let's do it again.
[371:12.33]I think I can just jump.
[371:18.72]But I could probably do it.
[371:24.84]Okay, now let's try this again.
[371:26.38]Alright, good.
[371:30.13]Good, good.
[371:31.39]Kill the bee.
[371:39.59]We're almost there to the last mission of the game.
[371:41.19]Can you see how close we are?
[371:44.73]Final mission incoming.
[371:46.29]There's another platform over here.
[371:48.59]No.
[372:08.75]There's like three more levels.
[372:09.93]Yeah, so we're at the final one.
[372:13.55]After those, two.
[372:27.85]From here, is this the other building?
[372:31.67]No, same one.
[372:32.95]Alright.
[372:33.72]Need more money!
[372:43.78]Car wash?
[372:59.35]Nothing.
[372:59.75]Wait, nothing in the car wash?
[373:00.85]I already got the car wash money.
[373:05.69]The next level is bot, and then home.
[373:10.23]So what does he have here?
[373:13.33]Bot, bot, homo.
[373:15.81]Mod.
[373:19.17]I see coins up there.
[373:22.08]Is there a way for me to get up there?
[373:34.15]Uh...
[373:36.09]What's the blue underneath here?
[373:38.15]Can I interact with this?
[373:40.49]Doesn't look like it.
[373:47.76]What does stairs do?
[373:59.14]Are there stairs over here?
[374:00.20]On one of these boxcars?
[374:06.79]He did this earlier.
[374:07.59]Yeah, I know, but I'm on a different character.
[374:11.29]Can't go in.
[374:13.39]That was an incredible move.
[374:14.69]There might be another way.
[374:19.34]I guess I could go on a car and then... Anywhere inside that I can go?
[374:31.28]No random place I can go in the corner or something?
[374:39.63]I don't think so.
[374:47.16]Well... I can probably jump from... I can't jump from that.
[374:56.37]Can I jump from this?
[375:06.68]Just go up the stairs.
[375:08.96]I mean, talk about all the way back here.
[375:38.49]Can I make it from here to there?
[375:39.67]I'm going to have to run very far away.
[375:41.85]I have to go all the way across.
[375:44.66]Is there anything even over there?
[375:45.40]There's nothing even over there.
[375:46.14]What am I getting?
[375:47.56]I did this earlier, yeah, but I'm talking about over past that top of that thing over there.
[375:53.93]And that's what I get.
[375:57.43]I'm not talking about getting to where those coins are.
[375:59.19]I'm talking about the other side.
[376:03.89]I'm talking like down there.
[376:32.97]He'll do it. 500.
[376:45.78]Is he on drugs?
[376:46.98]Uh, no.
[376:48.00]When you hold run in this game, it makes you, it forces you to go under a straight line.
[376:53.65]So, for about a half second when you run, you have to go in the direction that you started the run.
[376:58.09]You can't turn.
[376:59.33]So it's like, whoop!
[377:01.01]So sometimes you fall.
[377:02.28]Sometimes you slip.
[377:07.12]Alright, let's go.
[377:16.13]Why'd I jump down?
[377:16.77]Because I have 500 coins.
[377:17.45]I don't want that card.
[377:34.56]Alright.
[377:37.16]Buy it. 500.
[377:45.70]Where is it?
[377:46.06]I thought I could buy it from the... From here, right?
[377:55.13]Could I buy it from here?
[378:02.27]Have to buy it from... I thought you could buy it from a phone.
[378:08.97]Oh.
[378:12.63]You have to talk to Homer, but... Weren't there a bunch of other scenarios where I could just get it from the phone?
[378:22.64]He said you could summon it at a phone.
[378:23.92]Uh, yeah.
[378:24.18]That's what I thought.
[378:38.84]Move your clumsy vehicle!
[378:43.22]Get out of the way!
[379:09.33]Excuse me.
[379:09.83]Alright, Springfield Park.
[379:16.67]Springfield Hospital is down this way over there.
[379:20.75]This is the park.
[379:28.61]Here we are.
[379:30.87]Hello, Homer.
[379:34.07]I'll take your custom car, please.
[379:36.31]Do you have an oversized vehicle?
[379:38.45]Whoops.
[379:43.30]Okay, there it is.
[379:44.52]Car built for Homer of 500 coins.
[379:50.42]I must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[379:59.83]Hit the van and collected the diapers.
[380:02.57]You almost hit a person!
[380:06.11]Homer's underwater taxi.
[380:08.33]This is just between me and you, random object.
[380:15.23]Oh, you thought he was going over the thing.
[380:17.78]Hold on, itchy nose.
[380:18.62]Not good.
[380:19.06]I gotta restart.
[380:20.94]Alright.
[380:21.18]Who is in this car?
[380:25.98]Who the fuck is in this car?
[380:47.24]Oh, I smashed my skull!
[380:52.12]Uh, Ambulance King, please.
[381:01.45]Use Horn!
[381:03.57]Use Horn!
[381:15.22]This guy's driving me wrong.
[381:20.98]This guy's freaking me out.
[381:22.70]Bad.
[381:23.40]Big time.
[381:25.72]Okay, drive to the hospital.
[381:30.85]Alright, talk to Dr. Hibbert.
[381:42.34]Alright, final mission incoming.
[381:45.77]That was close.
[381:46.89]Another minute in my office would look like the Ganges River.
[381:50.26]Shiva H. Vishnu.
[381:52.12]My jubilation knows no bounds.
[382:08.14]That was way too fast.
[382:13.10]Here we are at our final destination.
[382:15.24]It's just between me and you, random object.
[382:18.87]I know my facecam's not on.
[382:19.97]Why?
[382:20.17]There's no rea- Put down the rocks!
[382:39.43]Hello, famous American clown.
[382:41.31]I wish to ask a favor.
[382:42.76]Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[382:46.78]I require information about drugs delivering evil cola.
[382:50.28]How can I get this classified data?
[382:52.16]Sorry, Apu.
[382:53.48]I'm a drink-squeezy, punchy lowlife.
[382:55.80]You need a professional scumbag.
[382:56.76]You're putting them down by throwing them.
[382:58.04]Follow a cop until you find one.
[383:00.10]You'll have better luck if you, you know, look American.
[383:04.68]Thank you, horrible man.
[383:07.95]Need a disguise?
[383:08.75]Purchase.
[383:09.53]Whose American clothes?
[383:11.02]Another 425 coins.
[383:11.90]Shit.
[383:12.50]57 coins.
[383:13.04]Alright, we have to scrounge around now.
[383:34.06]We're gonna find boxes.
[383:37.09]We're gonna find soda machines.
[383:38.33]There's a box over here.
[383:39.15]Do a wager race?
[383:46.24]We've seen how much of a disaster those were.
[383:48.06]I should sleep more.
[384:04.69]Alright.
[384:09.61]Not a bad start.
[384:13.24]Destroy cars.
[384:14.04]Got a box right here.
[384:21.48]And a beat.
[384:35.45]It took a lot longer than it should have.
[384:36.93]400, right?
[384:44.82]Or was it 425?
[385:01.44]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[385:04.06]What about the statues?
[385:06.09]I need to get in a car.
[385:15.19]How about one of my cars?
[385:29.70]oh fathering eight children has really hurt my stamina try doing a race with a hover car get alright sure my robo roommate is being a jerk and I need to get out so let's try whatever you got here there's a box behind you
[385:56.08]Hey, aren't you the boy who nearly drowned in the nacho cheese?
[385:59.04]I was in the newspaper.
[386:00.42]Alright.
[386:05.48]Do I actually get money for these?
[386:08.60]I'm going to hit it.
[386:10.74]Those are blocked up.
[386:11.32]Too slow, opposing vehicle.
[386:13.30]Color me outraged.
[386:17.34]You have no chance.
[386:22.60]This is a slippery course.
[386:26.78]Oi.
[386:31.42]Hmm... Do they block off of most of these ways to skip through?
[386:41.13]Um... I think I'm gonna have to restart this.
[386:42.87]Yeah, this is a lost cause right now.
[387:02.19]Unless I can... I don't think I can do anything.
[387:04.85]No.
[387:05.99]Maybe I could have, like... Spun around.
[387:09.75]Um... This is not even going to give me money.
[387:25.02]If I beat this, do I get coins?
[387:26.94]I don't think that's going to happen.
[387:39.52]maybe these objects must be part flubber oh what a disgrace oh come on he cheated the journey is the reward now that's true
[388:05.98]Mmm, floaty.
[388:06.62]I'm really floaty.
[388:08.32]I will tell you.
[388:09.88]I don't think I'm ever gonna do this.
[388:21.49]He's about to beat me, isn't he?
[388:24.75]I wonder why.
[388:25.45]Maybe it's because you are literally floating.
[388:28.79]A little too floaty.
[388:51.38]It's not even going to give me money at this point.
[388:53.32]Hit it!
[388:54.54]What?
[388:55.62]I just fell off.
[389:29.72]I got a feeling I'll get it up here.
[389:31.49]Maybe.
[389:31.73]It's possible.
[389:37.54]Fuck god!
[390:02.40]Almost there.
[390:14.49]100 more coins and it's done.
[390:17.75]Ride the mon- ride on the monorail.
[390:22.16]Bite the monorail.
[390:40.27]Oh, how do we got this?
[390:41.51]This looks... Alright, I'll try to get on the monorail.
[390:56.78]Wow, that was close.
[391:01.94]Okay, well, hold on a second here, Jeremy.
[391:11.46]Um, this little lip right here?
[391:14.74]Okay.
[391:15.26]Oh, why am I sliding?
[391:19.76]I just had it.
[391:33.87]Okay, well, that's... I couldn't get back up there.
[391:39.27]Not allowed up there.
[391:45.89]No, that's the wrong.
[391:46.91]You're just very silly.
[391:48.01]You're a foolish person.
[391:51.69]Now he's going to think that's the right way.
[391:53.03]No, I think that's the wrong way.
[391:55.23]Hey, watch it, buster.
[391:57.58]I think that's the incorrect way.
[392:00.06]Or do I?
[392:02.02]I'll never know.
[392:05.34]The person is stuck on my car.
[392:08.18]Alright, I got... There is... Can I get up there?
[392:15.69]I'm trying to, like, look up.
[392:17.55]So, I already did this though, didn't I?
[392:19.37]Hold on.
[392:19.79]There's shit over here.
[392:20.63]So close.
[392:21.67]Gag.
[392:43.10]Any more vending machines back here.
[392:44.94]I see a truck.
[392:46.62]I'm gonna go on top.
[392:50.71]This looks platformy, doesn't it?
[392:54.61]I'm flying!
[393:04.58]95!
[393:09.82]Ugh!
[393:10.94]Really, where is it?
[393:14.85]Can I not grab it from there?
[393:19.97]Oh, right.
[393:21.75]Okay.
[393:24.07]I thought I could get it by just jumping.
[393:25.35]Can I get up there?
[393:29.68]I think I can.
[393:31.18]Hold on.
[393:31.44]I don't think so.
[393:42.58]Whatever.
[393:42.82]I need like three coins.
[393:43.76]Let's just go.
[393:54.70]There is another vending machine over here, I think.
[394:01.32]Where was it?
[394:03.36]Something up here.
[394:08.04]Done.
[394:08.30]Alright.
[394:14.39]Let's do the last mission in the game.
[394:20.89]Why have I been streaming for seven hours?
[394:25.64]I don't know, because I kind of... I like streaming.
[394:31.89]I want to beat this game, and... I don't know.
[394:48.02]He only kind of likes streaming.
[394:49.76]Crusty.
[394:50.44]Do I have to buy the costume?
[394:53.22]Or can I get it from somewhere besides?
[394:56.72]I think I have to buy the costume first, don't I?
[395:26.70]Yeah, I need the clothes, right?
[395:31.02]300 horses of convenient power.
[395:34.24]Need to buy clothes.
[395:38.65]Can I get some clothes in this vicinity?
[396:02.12]This is not good for my insurance.
[396:17.10]Hey!
[396:18.24]Eyes on the road, jerk!
[396:20.00]You should not have stepped in front of my car!
[396:28.45]I wish there was an indicator where a place like that was.
[396:32.23]Because I'm not... I can't memorize where every storefront is.
[396:44.97]Vishnu!
[396:45.89]Here I come!
[396:46.65]Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.
[396:55.15]It can't be like a shirt blip or something?
[397:09.75]Okay, I need this.
[397:10.93]Now we go.
[397:39.33]Wrong clothes?
[397:39.91]I know it's the right clothes.
[397:41.19]I know it's the right one.
[397:44.70]You would have heard a very loud panic if I figured out that I did something wrong.
[397:52.50]Thank you for not dodging.
[397:54.65]Hello, famous American clown.
[397:58.77]I wish to ask a favor.
[398:00.21]Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[398:02.93]Look at my new outfit.
[398:04.31]What?
[398:32.88]Follow the police to find a criminal.
[398:34.14]Follow the trail of donuts.
[398:36.08]21 donuts!
[399:09.07]They really weave him around, don't they?
[399:11.33]Look, that guy.
[399:13.95]What the hell is that guy doing?
[399:16.29]What are you thinking?
[399:26.78]Got it.
[399:31.96]Follow Chief Wiggum to find a professional criminal.
[399:39.49]He's kind of hard to follow.
[399:43.53]He's kind of insane.
[400:10.47]Alright, find the criminal.
[400:12.81]Please.
[400:13.23]Ugh.
[400:41.95]no why would you do that why why would you just try to kill me
[401:00.73]Found him.
[401:01.11]Not fun mission coming up here.
[401:29.59]Collect all the garbage before time runs out.
[401:31.91]Don't miss any pieces of garbage.
[401:34.39]Uh, okay.
[401:34.81]Let's go.
[401:35.41]Follow the garbage truck and collect the garbage.
[401:45.73]Armored garbage, armored truck, garbage truck.
[401:47.83]Is this what you guys were talking about before?
[401:58.06]I shouldn't be getting timed off down for this.
[402:00.07]Or...
[402:26.11]And give me a five.
[402:27.33]What do you say?
[402:38.60]Give me.
[402:40.36]Drop it.
[402:44.64]Collect the remaining garbage.
[402:46.77]How did I just lose time?
[402:49.56]Never have I seen such a four-wheel disgrace.
[402:52.42]Wait, hold on.
[402:53.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[402:54.52]What?
[402:54.88]What?
[402:55.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[402:56.29]Do I have to go up top?
[402:57.47]Do I have to get out of the car?
[403:09.55]No, I don't.
[403:10.16]Watch out.
[403:16.52]Oh fuck, I do have to get out of the car.
[403:18.62]Back to the train.
[403:20.62]Oh no.
[403:44.56]I didn't think, oh man, I thought I had a chance, I thought it wasn't, mm, man, oh, this, oh, I hate this.
[403:51.69]Oh, no.
[403:57.45]What am I doing in this car?
[403:58.47]No, no, give me a better car.
[404:00.02]I need to have, like, the best possible scenario here.
[404:18.96]No, no, no.
[404:20.46]I need... I had two minutes.
[404:25.76]Yeah, but I didn't want to give myself the opportunity to... This just wasn't going to happen.
[404:33.01]I would have got to the end, and if we had 10 seconds left, then I would have lost, and I would have been so angry.
[404:37.97]Give me a new... I'm just going to get the sedan.
[404:50.35]Uh, I mean, this car is pretty great, actually.
[404:53.31]What's the difference between this and the Homer car?
[404:55.89]Where is it?
[404:56.33]Yeah, that's disgusting.
[405:18.72]I can't let this mission be physical pain for me, but it could be.
[405:24.32]Really.
[405:26.02]The pain has already begun.
[405:30.76]Put it, like, right in the fucking side of the building.
[405:34.38]God.
[405:39.42]I must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[405:51.32]So you gotta get out on foot.
[405:52.98]I just gotta... I wish I didn't have to do this part.
[405:59.93]What are you doing?
[406:28.64]Alright, so he just drove straight into the other lane.
[406:38.78]I wouldn't even mind falling.
[406:41.12]I wouldn't even touch him.
[406:47.50]Alright, get the last of the garbage.
[406:48.70]I'm ready.
[406:49.06]I'm ready.
[406:49.38]I'm ready.
[406:49.66]I'm ready to do it.
[406:50.25]I'm ready to do it.
[406:50.85]Here we go.
[406:54.40]We've got... I'm going to turn... Here's what I'm going to do.
[406:57.82]This way first.
[407:01.83]Go over the jump.
[407:02.83]Out of the car.
[407:22.26]Okay out cars right here Fathering eight children has really hurt my stamina Just give me a minute I've got to be careful
[407:50.71]Can I even make this shit?
[408:00.88]Alright, that's it.
[408:01.82]Get me back in the car.
[408:15.55]Oh my god, I punched that guy in the face.
[408:19.94]Around this way?
[408:23.06]In here?
[408:23.54]Oh, Jesus!
[408:42.33]Why?!
[408:43.93]The like, clippy little bullshit!
[408:47.49]I'm trying to double jump!
[408:50.88]Just do it!
[408:52.60]Alright, now what?
[409:03.47]There's so many other ones that I missed already.
[409:06.47]Give me the car.
[409:08.97]There's two back there.
[409:17.79]Wrap around this way.
[409:18.79]Where are they?
[409:19.19]Get out of the car.
[409:19.81]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[409:25.04]Can I walk it?
[409:25.66]Do I have... Go, Quimby.
[409:33.29]Go, Quimby.
[409:47.88]G-Money crickets?
[409:56.16]Fresh air is somewhat confusing.
[410:35.81]Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today.
[410:47.48]That's not fair.
[410:48.64]That's not fair.
[410:51.88]It's not fair.
[410:52.83]I'm so defeated.
[411:07.79]I did it too, and I- no, I had it!
[411:10.75]I win!
[411:12.85]I'm so defeated.
[411:23.20]I didn't buy any controllers.
[411:25.46]No, and I like forget everything already.
[411:30.52]I just had an extra two seconds being in that- an extra half of a second being in that car.
[411:40.94]I could have just used the car for the last part, but I didn't know, I didn't, I didn't know, I didn't know.
[411:45.56]I got it.
[411:47.48]I'm gonna get it.
[411:48.48]Ohhhh.
[411:55.09]Oh, I've lost it.
[411:56.39]I've lost it.
[411:56.93]All my energy is expelled.
[412:02.15]Get out of here!
[412:05.17]Punch that guy in the face!
[412:19.64]perhaps I should refrain okay here we go just remember I have to remember you must remember go around jump grab the car on the other side why would you put that last one there why did you put the last one in the worst what in the hell were you thinking I am a mean mean machine
[413:00.95]No!
[413:03.53]I haven't lost yet.
[413:17.22]I haven't lost... I'm getting stuck and everything.
[413:21.16]If I don't make this jump... A bite mark is gonna go... Oh my god, mommy!
[413:35.57]He can't sprint faster than this?
[413:38.37]Let's go!
[413:46.26]300 horses of convenient power.
[413:51.56]This is just between me and you, random object.
[413:54.49]Who put this here?
[413:55.97]It makes no sense.
[414:00.95]Whee!
[414:18.38]Get in!
[414:25.22]Come to papa, random object.
[414:34.53]This is not good for my insurance.
[414:36.65]Your misfortune is most entertaining to me.
[414:41.80]Oh, I got him.
[414:44.61]What is the blip doing?
[414:47.37]What's the blip doing?
[414:48.73]Why was the mini-map freaking out?
[415:20.93]Out of the fucking way.
[415:22.23]Get out of my way.
[415:23.83]Out of my way.
[415:24.47]I must finish quickly or vomit.
[415:43.67]My friend has the information at the DMV.
[415:46.21]Go pick it up.
[415:47.28]Pronto.
[415:48.22]Oh, thank you.
[415:49.16]Thank you, my violent associate.
[415:50.60]Okay.
[415:58.82]I did it.
[416:02.29]Empty.
[416:03.33]I am the victim of chicanery.
[416:05.01]Most vile.
[416:05.87]That's it, Daffu.
[416:06.97]Make them like it.
[416:09.31]That was not that bad, but it was.
[416:27.22]If I even took... Wait, hold on.
[416:28.50]If I took even one or two or three extra seconds getting the items, I would have lost.
[416:38.45]Sir, this folder is empty.
[416:40.19]To rob me is one thing, but I never expected you to lie.
[416:42.91]Dude, relax, okay?
[416:45.19]I've got the info you need.
[416:47.17]I just need help with a little more community service.
[416:49.33]That mission was actually pretty easy.
[416:50.67]Don't worry.
[416:51.51]Oh, I'm totally evil.
[416:53.31]I should know better than to trust that demented chuckle.
[416:59.13]Help Snake with his community service destroy the armored car and avoid Chief Wiggle.
[417:07.91]Has this seven hour stream culminated to this point right here?
[417:17.09]Don't throw any rocks.
[417:18.29]Don't throw rocks at me.
[417:54.39]This town is going to pay for this.
[417:58.37]Listen, you two.
[417:59.09]This is not the time for you to do this right now.
[418:00.97]Please.
[418:01.35]Lose the tail.
[418:02.80]That person got fucking destroyed.
[418:07.10]What the heck were you thinking?
[418:08.40]Dude, you better not have scratched my car.
[418:31.25]Still got a tail on me here?
[418:32.57]Destroy the armored car.
[418:59.14]Come on, into a wall and I'll get it immediately.
[419:07.05]This car's gonna explode.
[419:09.65]I just gotta get him to drive into a wall.
[419:12.49]You just drive this motherfucker straight into a wall.
[419:31.05]No timer, that's a good thing.
[419:32.09]That was pretty good, but didn't do much damage.
[419:35.71]Right into the wall!
[419:39.13]Oh, fuck you!
[419:59.30]How did you get so good at driving a car?
[420:00.74]That's the one time I needed to do that.
[420:02.64]And I didn't do it.
[420:03.32]Right into the fucking wall.
[420:07.49]Do it.
[420:07.89]That was a lot.
[420:10.41]Oh, he's going to fuck himself.
[420:13.97]He's going to fuck himself over.
[420:15.31]Oh, no.
[420:31.70]Although, look at me.
[420:39.14]I'm in trouble too.
[420:39.90]Uh-oh.
[420:45.05]Can I get out of the car?
[420:47.87]I'm not touching him until I find a wrench.
[420:58.32]I saw one earlier.
[421:03.18]Wrench, wrench, wrench.
[421:04.22]Maybe he'll just blow up and do a walk.
[421:06.98]There's a wrench right there.
[421:07.92]How do I get that?
[421:08.48]I have to go over, like, that jump.
[421:11.68]I gotta go over the jump that's over there.
[421:13.86]But I'll lose him, won't I?
[421:18.83]And then the mission will be over.
[421:26.21]Don't touch him.
[421:26.89]He'll do it himself.
[421:35.84]Good?
[421:36.44]Good?
[421:36.78]Got it.
[421:37.05]He went down this way!
[422:10.87]He's so close!
[422:11.85]Did it!
[422:12.05]I'm well aware that I just did a full-on pallbearer.
[422:25.62]I just screamed for Kane.
[422:27.04]Kane!
[422:28.14]We undertake!
[422:29.18]Alright, so did I win?
[422:31.12]Did I beat the game?
[422:33.36]Game over?
[422:59.01]What in the hell were you thinking?
[423:03.69]What?
[423:06.50]What do you mean?
[423:07.32]What are you talking about?
[423:12.94]Oh my fucking god.
[423:14.04]I am a lean, mean, vindaloo machine.
[423:39.80]Lose the fuckin' tail!
[423:49.23]It's at zero!
[423:50.71]It's at zero!
[423:52.63]It's at zero!
[423:56.19]What... just happened?
[424:00.47]WHAAAA?
[424:09.78]No way!
[424:16.19]I'm gonna slow down, man.
[424:17.31]I'm gonna fucking pass out.
[424:25.19]This has been like a cartoon character stream.
[424:30.13]If you do not tell me who owns the cola trucks, then I will be forced to use profanity.
[424:35.90]Okay, okay.
[424:37.24]Calm down, dude.
[424:38.02]No, I'm just kidding.
[424:38.82]The cola trucks are registered to the museum.
[424:41.50]The museum?
[424:43.34]Each level of this adventure is more exciting than the last.
[424:47.43]I feel like a Brahmin.
[424:48.57]I mean, yeah, this is a cartoon, you're right.
[424:52.85]Talk to Bart.
[424:53.45]What the hell are you doing here?
[424:57.68]Oh, Mr. Bart, I have discovered that the evil cola is being made in the Springfield Museum.
[425:02.74]But that closes in five minutes.
[425:04.50]And my car is out of gas.
[425:06.10]Just fill it up at the Quickie Mart.
[425:07.74]At those prices?
[425:08.94]No way.
[425:09.60]Fine, we'll take my car.
[425:13.95]Drive to the museum before the curator leaves.
[425:15.71]Bart Simpson at your service.
[425:18.65]Must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[425:23.71]Jiminy crickets!
[425:29.71]He's nowhere for me to go.
[425:38.76]Ten seconds.
[425:40.78]Oh, it's right there.
[425:44.32]This... Oh, we're good.
[425:48.85]Destroy.
[425:49.47]Another destroy the car minigame.
[425:53.45]Just whipped a fucking crawl bar at us.
[426:00.14]This one is timed.
[426:01.38]You're gonna turn!
[426:30.46]Oh, you just got absolutely, absolutely ruined.
[426:42.67]I don't know why I'm doing it like this.
[426:45.89]Oh!
[426:46.39]Oh!
[427:02.27]You just keep, at the last second, getting away from me.
[427:19.23]How are you still living after that?
[427:20.92]You just crashed!
[427:23.78]You just crashed!
[427:30.72]You just... Get him!
[427:35.89]Oh, I gotta go to the museum.
[427:37.19]You idiot.
[427:37.79]I don't care.
[427:38.17]Give me a ticket.
[427:39.13]Write it up.
[427:40.59]I don't need it.
[428:10.49]Oh, yeah.
[428:11.20]I totally rule.
[428:12.46]I am the greatest driv- I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually excited to be going to a museum.
[428:20.20]I don't need- No, I'm talking about what do I need the money for.
[428:24.60]In The Simpsons video game.
[428:25.64]Shiva!
[428:26.28]H!
[428:26.40]Vishnu!
[428:27.26]The cola is dripping from that meteor!
[428:29.66]Cool!
[428:30.26]Free deadly cola!
[428:49.88]What the hell is going on?
[428:59.35]Spoiler
[429:13.24]Brilliant.
[429:43.14]Can you two rinse?
[430:09.19]You've got to prevent the aliens from putting laser guns in the hands of cola-drunk townspeople.
[430:25.92]Why?
[430:26.18]That sounds hilarious.
[430:27.38]I'd watch that show.
[430:28.16]I tell you what, you're a bad little boy.
[430:31.87]Failfish.
[430:34.35]We're in all the land.
[430:36.42]Did it.
[430:38.04]50% streamer, that's fine.
[430:44.34]Okay.
[430:46.10]So... I believe we've made it to the end of the game.
[430:55.94]Right?
[430:58.64]Oops.
[431:00.13]Two more missions?
[431:00.99]Okay.
[431:23.07]He should be a little lower.
[431:25.03]Collect all the kids and get to Krusty Lou Studios before Krusty leaves.
[431:52.71]One, two, three, go!
[431:53.85]Do I have to stop, or just run over?
[431:55.47]Okay, just run over.
[431:56.35]Alright, oh, come on.
[432:14.92]Self-explanatory.
[432:17.80]Just get him in the car.
[432:19.68]I was assuming we were going to be going the other way.
[432:25.39]I didn't do it.
[432:36.50]Did somebody have to go through the fire?
[432:43.55]Did I get... We didn't make it.
[432:49.39]We didn't make it.
[432:51.11]And that didn't pick him up.
[432:52.03]Apparently not.
[432:53.35]Here come the cops.
[433:03.28]No worries.
[433:04.88]Whoa!
[433:05.48]That was a big one.
[433:06.66]Whoa!
[433:09.38]Come on, man.
[433:09.92]Just the remaining five.
[433:11.12]Are you even watching the road?
[433:12.70]There's only four more.
[433:14.28]We've got plenty of time.
[433:17.11]Bogus!
[433:18.21]Lisa did it.
[433:19.43]13, 14, 15.
[433:19.53]Bogus!
[433:20.17]Oh, my God.
[433:23.21]Well, I ain't going to get there in 15 seconds.

[434:13.64]Yep.
[434:45.78]I can still get it.
[434:53.08]Just don't drive into the studio symbol.
[434:58.27]This is not about speed.
[434:59.71]It's just about getting there in the time.
[435:01.95]You don't have to go fast.
[435:03.49]You just have to get the kids.
[435:05.85]Just pick up those kids.
[435:07.41]Get them in the school bus.
[435:11.25]I have plenty more time.
[435:16.11]I have... Just a straight shot.
[435:21.75]Here's the studio.
[435:22.56]Right up here.
[435:26.00]Don't worry about the time.
[435:27.06]It's just there to make you panic.
[435:30.70]I'm fine.
[435:31.28]I made it.
[435:31.94]There we go.
[435:32.52]Straight ahead.
[435:33.52]Forget about the time.
[435:34.30]I have... Get out of my fucking way!
[435:37.22]I win.
[435:40.44]Any money?
[435:41.58]I don't see any money.
[435:59.52]Barney, where's Krusty?
[436:00.88]I have to warn him.
[436:02.04]Krusty's not here, little Homer.
[436:03.90]He's down at the squid port.
[436:05.00]There's that kid again.
[436:05.76]I want a promo for this new buzz cola.
[436:08.27]That's the cola the aliens are using to control all human behavior.
[436:11.49]Control human behavior?
[436:13.63]No beverage could do that.
[436:15.85]Oh, no.
[436:16.57]I haven't had a duff in two hours.
[436:18.39]My life is over.
[436:22.29]But I have to get to Krusty before the limo does.
[436:24.73]And I have to stay here and go through the DTs.
[436:27.45]Sounds like a plan.
[436:30.42]Find Krusty's limo to find Krusty.
[436:32.02]Talk to Krusty before his limo picks him up.
[436:34.49]Uh, well, it just blew by.
[436:43.70]Okay, where did...
[437:06.28]That's not a shortcut, and I thought it was.
[437:07.70]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[437:12.34]It's over.
[437:12.74]It's over again.
[437:15.88]Bart Simpson at your service.
[437:20.77]Get in, Bart.
[437:21.45]Hurry.
[437:30.61]This sucks.
[437:31.87]Don't even worry about it.
[437:32.93]Everything's fine.
[437:34.25]Let's roll.
[437:37.00]Hey, thanks for the boost, motherfucker!
[437:56.83]You made this much easier on me.
[437:59.64]And I thank you for that.
[438:12.89]Changing lanes twice in a row.
[438:15.75]Change lanes, change lanes, change lanes.
[438:18.31]Talk to the limo driver.
[438:19.87]What are you doing?
[438:21.07]What?
[438:21.17]What just happened?
[438:41.89]He just peeled out.
[438:46.86]Um... I see him.
[438:55.98]He's in my sights.
[438:56.60]Hold on.
[438:57.94]Out of the way.
[439:00.72]Out of the way.
[439:15.62]I'm just glad I'm not... No problemo!
[439:20.30]Oh my fucking god.
[439:21.48]What happened when I went to go talk to the limo driver?
[439:23.58]It was like... Time to race!
[439:31.47]Oh man, that sucks and blows.
[439:33.31]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!
[439:42.68]Just park your car.
[439:43.42]I'm gonna park my car in front of his.
[439:45.97]Yeah.
[439:46.79]What the hell was that?
[440:01.55]Okay.
[440:02.94]Don't do that shit again.

[440:48.58]It's not even possible.
[440:50.33]I did the... I did the shortcut and it just got stuck in the fucking spokes of the wheel.
[441:09.33]I don't remember this being here before.
[441:11.89]Boring.
[441:12.49]Why is that thing here?
[441:16.28]What is the point of that thing?
[441:19.06]I can't believe I have to do this again.
[441:20.26]Bark time.
[441:26.78]I didn't do it.
[441:33.74]It's time for some roading.
[441:35.24]I hate Bing.
[441:41.05]Alright, I'm gonna park a different car in front of him.
[441:44.56]No, you know what?
[441:45.66]Fuck you game.

[443:14.27]He's going to back out?
[443:15.13]No, no, no.
[443:15.73]Don't you worry about that.
[443:16.55]He ain't backing out.
[443:25.54]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[443:32.34]It's time for some road rage, Bart Simpson style.

[444:54.67]Frosty, how are you?
[444:56.37]Finish my game, please.
[444:57.28]Free laser guns and cola that makes you go crazy.
[444:59.88]It'll be a massacre.
[445:00.92]The streets will be littered with lasered off limbs and heads.
[445:03.70]Yeah, right.
[445:04.76]And I'm getting into the country western hall of fame.
[445:07.76]It just ain't gonna happen, kid.
[445:09.91]Oh, I just gotta find evidence.
[445:12.13]Who do I know that's smart enough to prove this alien conspiracy?
[445:15.63]Bumblebee man?
[445:16.63]Comic book guy?
[445:17.83]Disco stool?
[445:19.47]That's it.
[445:20.17]A nerd.
[445:21.01]Professor Frank.
[445:23.72]Find and follow Professor Frink.
[445:25.56]Bart Simpson at your service.
[445:27.87]Okay.
[445:29.93]Time to lay some rubber down.
[445:32.59]People conveniently just drive right by you.
[445:34.43]Take that!
[445:54.80]You are magically not hitting any of these obstacles in the way.
[446:06.77]When I beat this game, I'm going to reward myself with a triple cheeseburger.
[446:14.21]I'm getting a triple cheeseburger.
[446:16.96]And Jatt gets to pick from where?
[446:27.08]Go to the Krusty Burger.
[446:28.84]Oh, that was so cool!
[446:56.50]From a garbage can.
[446:58.92]I'm not going to do that.
[447:04.02]Are we going to get that cutscene where he stops?
[447:14.67]You can't order a burger from Amazon, can you?
[447:21.97]Uh, AM Scoots.
[447:22.92]10 community subs, thank you.
[447:26.36]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[447:29.52]Tons of community subs tonight, guys.
[447:30.70]You guys rock.
[447:32.70]I almost didn't make that jump.
[447:44.23]Amazon Restaurants is a thing.
[447:47.91]That's interesting.
[447:54.14]Mr. Frank, you've got to help me.
[447:56.04]No one believes my story.
[447:57.46]It's just like the boy who cried wolf, except instead of a wolf, it's an alien conspiracy.
[448:02.26]Aliens?
[448:03.26]Well, that would explain these strange transmissions from my plutonium CB radio.
[448:08.36]I must have intercepted an alien message.
[448:11.05]It says they're hiding the lasers in the duff trucks.
[448:14.13]Glahive and Glivey, the plot is convoluted now.
[448:17.37]Relax, nerdlinger.
[448:18.67]I'll knock the lasers out of the trucks so I can show them to Krusty.
[448:23.53]Drive to the brewery and stop the alien's plan.
[448:25.85]Hit the truck and collect the laser guns.
[448:29.95]Alright.
[448:30.89]I think we're about to see the final mission of the game before Homer Simpson has like eight more missions.
[448:34.83]Might as well get these right here.
[448:58.83]How did I get up here?
[449:39.53]Oops.
[449:41.25]Parked there.
[449:44.13]I'm gonna have to redo it.
[449:46.21]I'm gonna have to redo it.
[449:49.81]Oh my god.
[449:50.75]It happened again.
[449:52.11]I did the thing where the mission ends and it just goes to the end screen and I pressed up
[450:15.63]Car's about to explode.
[450:18.59]God damn it.
[450:24.10]I may as well just have a big blow-up.
[450:26.38]Take that!
[450:59.52]Professor!
[451:10.49]I don't have a car anymore, though.
[451:20.77]Does it still think this is my car?
[451:23.28]Oh.
[451:24.50]Get a new one.
[451:29.60]Okay.
[451:30.48]Try to get there in one piece, Bart.
[451:33.27]If you could try, that'd be wonderful.
[451:40.49]What is the speedrun on this game?
[451:42.63]What's, like, world record?
[451:54.50]Three seconds?
[451:56.42]How does that... What?
[452:00.07]Is there like a way to clip through the map and cheat or something?
[452:06.57]By the way, where the fuck am I going?
[452:09.77]What is happening to me?
[452:20.43]Do I really not have that much time to get down there?
[452:22.23]I have to go through some kind of shortcut or something, don't I?
[452:30.76]Alright, well, I need to... I'm obviously looking at chat again because I'm asking questions.
[452:36.77]Hour and 28 minutes.
[452:40.85]Bart Simpson at your service.
[452:42.61]I think I need to take a bath after this.
[453:01.78]And just lie there with my eyes closed and cucumbers on my eyes.
[453:04.12]What the fuck was that horse shit, man?
[453:19.48]I'm just going through here.
[453:20.24]Fuck it.
[453:20.52]If I would tell you... Forget it.
[453:22.58]What do I do?
[453:23.26]Hit the duff truck and destroy the boxes!
[453:30.32]Hit the dump truck.
[453:31.20]Get the boxes.
[453:32.74]I need six.
[453:39.73]Two.
[453:41.01]Good RNG there.
[453:41.77]Good RNG.
[453:43.51]Good RNG.
[453:47.06]Good RNG.
[454:09.39]Nothing?
[454:15.46]Nothing from that either.
[454:24.08]Back to Duff Brewery.
[454:29.95]Back to Duff Brewery.
[454:30.81]Let's go.
[454:53.26]Don't drive off the cliff or something.
[454:55.71]No, and the police are on the way.
[455:05.05]Find a laser gun to use as proof.
[455:09.57]Where do you want?
[455:10.23]What is it?
[455:10.65]What is it?
[455:11.51]What is it?
[455:13.41]Chat, help me out here.
[455:14.23]What's going on?
[455:14.69]What happened here?
[455:15.35]Find a laser gun to use.
[455:16.79]Pick up a laser gun.
[455:23.80]Go right through the glass.
[455:28.36]Nice one.
[455:39.54]I show this laser gun to Krusty, he'll have to believe me.
[455:43.08]I can't believe I have a working laser gun and I'm using it for good.
[455:47.34]Drive to the taffy shop.
[455:49.56]There you got my attention, right?
[455:54.43]Chat helped?
[455:55.03]I probably would have driven off the flip.
[455:59.11]Speaking of which, no, don't do that.
[456:00.29]What if it ends the mission or something?
[456:06.74]That doesn't hit...
[456:10.01]Apparently it doesn't hit you.
[456:20.02]Save game.
[456:20.54]Thank you so much for that.
[456:25.10]You know what?
[456:28.78]No, I've... Nevermind.
[456:32.14]I was wrong.
[456:34.38]I thought I was gonna say something that made sense, but it was not gonna make any sense.
[456:41.54]you're all mine save save save save save I got it principal skinner principal skinner aliens are distributing deadly lasers all over Springfield we gotta warn everybody all we've gotta do young man is get that illicit goo god stream until Twitch shuts you off at 48 hours policy on lasers
[457:10.43]Uh, why would I do that?
[457:12.45]Destroy Principal Skimmer's car and take back the laser gun before time runs out.
[457:16.15]I'm just gonna block him and push him into the ocean.
[457:33.84]No problemo!
[457:43.31]I need some speed.
[457:46.05]Odd.
[457:49.99]Felt like I did some damage to you, but apparently I didn't.
[457:56.73]Apparently I didn't do any damage to you.
[458:06.12]I just hurt myself.
[458:12.62]Damn, you just took a huge hit.
[458:23.95]Take that.
[458:24.79]Lousy laws of physics.
[458:32.78]Use a stronger car?
[458:34.16]Yeah, but I mean... When I string together the mission like this, I kind of... I guess I could just jump out right now.
[458:41.08]I can get it.
[458:42.36]I'll get it.
[458:43.08]Yeah, he'll run into a wall and his car will explode.
[458:53.79]Here it comes.
[458:55.23]Look at how fast he's going.
[458:56.11]He can't control it.
[458:56.71]Right into this wall, straight ahead.
[459:00.62]Got it.
[459:13.77]Almost dead.
[459:14.55]I keep, like, peeling them out when I don't mean to do that.
[459:40.92]Convenient just go two miles per hour into me.
[459:43.79]See, this is where he could have done it.
[459:44.97]I need to slow down and just get right up him.
[460:14.38]Alright, maybe I do need to bag a car just to drive into him, because this is not working.
[460:24.05]This doesn't do enough damage when you hit him.
[460:27.47]Figured that would have done a lot of damage, but apparently not.
[460:35.32]Gonna have to get, like, the plow or something.
[460:38.72]Okay, that just... Where the fuck did he... My brain... I thought he drove off the cliff, and then... Oh, man.
[460:48.22]Get it.
[460:48.58]Skinner is dead.
[461:07.92]Skinner and his mom.
[461:09.82]They were both in the same car.
[461:13.22]So they were together.
[461:27.41]Shavar, the car is on fire!
[461:30.27]I'll take care of it in a moment, brother.
[461:39.49]This sucks.
[461:46.33]Prepared to be stuck on this level for an hour.
[461:48.77]Oh no.
[461:49.07]Oh no.
[462:11.41]To complete this mission, you will need the Globex Supervillain Car.
[462:14.64]Purchase it for 600 coins.
[462:20.32]How many coins do I have now?
[462:22.00]I need more coins! 200.
[462:42.11]Are these expensive?
[462:54.94]Somebody just said cheat.
[462:58.88]I can't cheat.
[463:00.48]I gotta play the way the game was meant to be played.
[463:03.59]Once you cheat, you can't go back.
[463:05.31]There's no turning back after a cheat.
[463:11.16]Which way do I want to go?
[463:11.88]Let's go this way first.
[463:22.66]Um... So what was the point of that?
[463:27.13]There's nothing up here.
[463:32.75]Oh my... Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[463:49.41]Didn't even need to cheat.
[463:50.27]The code is right in here.
[464:00.62]Alright.
[464:11.50]That helps.
[464:12.40]A lot.
[464:13.83]Any more hidden rooms that have money?
[464:17.67]There's a spot to go over here.
[464:25.25]Um, I guess I could have jumped over the other side.
[464:28.91]I wonder what's over there.
[464:29.59]Let me get over there again.
[464:44.06]What is it?
[464:46.35]Alright, cool.
[464:47.41]Okay.
[464:58.21]I thought this was going to take a lot longer.
[465:01.13]Thankfully, there was this shit over here.
[465:03.69]And I got another thing to platform around on.
[465:07.17]Which, where will this take me?
[465:08.15]Over the... Back to the... Yeah, back to where I was.
[465:14.35]Hi, uh, yeah, save the game.
[465:16.78]Good call!
[465:24.70]You missed a bonfire.
[465:28.78]Oh, well.
[465:32.72]Box over here.
[465:33.46]I'm going to guess yes.
[465:35.36]There's quite a lot back here.
[465:47.69]It's going to be done.
[465:48.29]I already did it.
[465:48.91]500 coins.
[465:57.13]Then I wish FromSoftware would make a Simpsons Souls.
[465:59.29]Look at the amount of characters that are in this universe.
[466:03.59]It'd be great.
[466:04.63]Nothing over there.
[466:25.74]Or like, dumb my 985.
[466:28.74]Get it?
[466:34.07]You know, that's the first rock I've seen thrown in at least... At least probably an hour or two.
[466:40.21]Alright, I almost got it.
[466:58.12]So I have to go buy.
[466:59.46]I guess I can buy from right there, right?
[467:01.54]Can I?
[467:05.40]I need... I need a little bit more money.
[467:08.75]I think there's probably some over here I can get.
[467:13.69]Maybe.
[467:14.01]Did I miss anything? $5.59.
[467:30.72]I'm here at the boat.
[467:31.86]Let's break shit.
[467:45.89]I'm looking around for like a bee or a box.
[467:54.65]Ooh, well.
[467:56.83]May have found something.
[467:59.82]Come on over here.
[468:00.57]I just saw it.
[468:09.19]That's a very dangerous part.
[468:10.25]You shouldn't be doing that.
[468:13.74]Okay.
[468:14.92]Bee gonna appear?
[468:21.24]No bee, no box.
[468:25.92]They should make a Simpsons TV show.
[468:33.82]These are some really interesting characters.
[468:35.15]Is there a box on the boat?
[468:41.27]I'm kind of up here for no reason, aren't I?
[468:55.13]That's very funny.
[468:57.47]I appreciate that, thank you.
[469:00.53]I tried as hard as I could.
[469:03.35]Okay, well, I guess there's nothing here.
[469:10.61]That was a gag.
[469:11.95]Well, that was a bug.
[470:07.99]See a box down here?
[470:11.98]But what about over here?
[470:12.70]There's one down here.
[470:20.45]Nope.
[470:22.13]Here is the rest of the money that I'll probably need for the rest of the game.
[470:24.69]Maybe.
[470:24.85]Depends on how much longer it is.
[470:41.57]Maybe I should stockpile a little bit.
[470:44.07]Just so I can have it, so I don't have to take time out.
[470:48.29]Because there's another way to go over there.
[470:51.99]Let me just take a look back here.
[470:55.78]Nothing.
[470:56.04]Okay.
[471:01.24]Out in the lip.
[471:12.27]The hell are you doing, Bart?
[471:13.63]Seven, twelve.
[471:14.23]Okay.
[471:14.99]I'm thinking top of the lighthouse.
[471:42.63]You know, I'm thinking top of the lighthouse.
[471:44.07]Let's do it.
[471:49.89]First let me get these.
[471:50.53]Can I play this at x2 speed?
[471:57.42]Uh, I need this money.
[472:13.23]I gotta have this money.
[472:18.33]I'm definitely gonna need it.
[472:21.83]It's gonna happen at some point.
[472:31.01]Really?
[472:31.37]There's something up here?
[472:32.39]Did I already do something up here?
[472:44.62]Nothing.
[472:51.32]Well, at least I have enough to keep going.
[472:52.55]I think I'm just going to jump off the edge.
[472:58.87]No, that costs money.
[472:59.31]Climb up that red arch.
[473:00.19]Well, there's another box right here.
[473:15.39]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat...
[473:26.00]So what do I need? Armored truck?
[473:31.00]What else have you got?
[473:37.00]I need something else.
[473:40.00]Uhhhh, hello?
[473:44.00]Hello drivers. Got a little situation here.
[473:53.65]Wrong guy.
[473:57.13]I need to get outta here.
[474:15.37]Oh, I know this one.
[474:16.39]Okay.
[474:16.65]I don't know why my nose is bothering me so much.
[474:23.65]My nose into my throat have just been super dry and shit.
[474:26.81]It's really annoying.
[474:28.61]Alright, no house.
[474:37.05]Alright, Krusty Studio is...
[474:46.70]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!
[474:49.90]Why would you like a newspaper upside your head?
[475:19.35]Isn't it where I was before?
[475:24.19]Am I out of my fucking mind?
[475:29.53]It's past the boat.
[475:33.91]Yeah, I'm not out of my... I'm not crazy.
[475:40.26]It's probably back there.
[475:50.00]Alright.
[475:51.08]I have enough money to buy the thing from Stinky, whatever his name is.
[475:56.97]Hey, Kearney.
[475:58.55]I need to do a lot of collateral damage in the minimum amount of time.
[476:02.39]I've got just the thing.
[476:03.79]I've got a car that was owned by a supervillain.
[476:07.44]He used it to conquer the East Coast.
[476:12.48]Lil' Bix supervillain car.
[476:13.76]Okay.
[476:18.31]Destroy all the free laser stands in Springfield before time runs out.
[476:22.83]Let's see.
[476:31.96]One out of... What's the placement on that one?
[476:38.02]What?
[476:46.72]Charlie horse!
[476:48.20]Charlie horse!
[477:08.48]They don't give you much time, do they?
[477:10.90]Time to lay some rubber down.
[477:12.72]It's all good.
[477:25.03]Hmm.
[477:47.54]Get out of the fu- What are you doing there?
[477:49.62]What are you doing there?
[477:51.38]What are you doing there?
[477:52.34]Why would you be there?
[477:53.80]Got lucky on that one.
[478:20.96]Come on, Krusty's... The stupid lip.
[478:24.48]The lip just fucked me over so bad.
[478:26.56]I can't even see.
[478:27.30]The smoke is everywhere.
[478:41.02]There's no way I did this in time.
[478:44.46]I am... I need, like, another 45 seconds.
[478:48.27]How on Earth... I need, like, another 20 seconds to do that.
[478:57.69]Holy shit, this is... You gotta be perfect and go full speed.
[479:02.95]Oh my god, people are giving a ton of money.
[479:06.23]Fitty just gave $100.
[479:06.83]Two $50 donations back-to-back.
[479:12.56]Alright, I'm going to do this right now.
[479:14.72]Fitty, this is for you.
[479:16.56]They say, hey, germs, I meant to get some sleep before the stream, but I accidentally slept for almost 10 hours straight.
[479:22.79]I rushed out to bed to check if he was still alive and accidentally full-on kicked this bucket of bits with my little toe.
[479:29.07]My eyes were filling with tears, so I almost stumbled into my walk-in oven and locked myself in.
[479:34.38]These bits almost killed me, so please take them.
[479:37.56]I'm really sorry about that.
[479:40.43]Thank you again, Fitty, for your 100 fucking dollars.
[479:44.31]Total.
[479:46.08]Also, in buying these last bits, Twitch told me there was an error with the transaction, and that I should try again.
[479:52.06]That error was apparently a lie, and now I bought them twice.
[479:55.71]Don't worry, I did have enough money for that.
[479:58.85]Might just be a while before I donate again.
[480:04.47]That's, well, uh, that's a $50 error.
[480:10.39]I will gladly take it.
[480:12.57]Thank you.
[480:16.79]Thank you so much, Fitty.
[480:20.44]Uh, 10 hours.
[480:23.48]Chicken wings?
[480:24.28]No, triple cheeseburgers tonight on me.
[480:27.12]This one's for you, Fitty.
[480:27.92]You ready?
[480:28.22]Watch it.
[480:28.48]Go!
[480:34.72]No, do it again.
[480:50.33]I... I fucked it up.
[480:52.27]I need every second.
[480:58.15]Is that supposed to be a penis or something?
[480:59.71]Hold on a second.
[481:00.41]Is that a dick?
[481:01.37]Is that a dick thing that they're doing?
[481:02.59]A penis thing they're doing?
[481:04.61]Oh, no, it's a laser.
[481:05.73]Right, okay.
[481:06.89]This one's for you, Fiddy.
[481:12.19]I'll get this one right here.
[481:16.15]Okay.
[481:35.47]I can make one mistake like that.
[481:36.51]How the fuck are you supposed to get that one?
[481:37.91]You need to do a tail drift into that thing.
[481:51.59]That thing's tucked so deeply into the... Whatever.
[481:54.83]Oh!
[482:05.26]I don't get how it's possible to get that.
[482:06.48]I don't understand.
[482:08.60]Yeah, it's gotta be a perfect drift, apparently.
[482:10.24]I don't know.
[482:14.48]Thanks.
[482:14.82]Thanks a lot for ruining everything, police.
[482:38.77]I can't imagine trying to speedrun this game and getting to this part.
[482:43.20]How many thousands of times do you have to do this before you get it perfect?
[483:03.63]I'm so focused on getting the one that's in the corner.
[483:34.36]I... I'm gonna ghostly blow it.
[483:39.54]Of course.
[483:39.86]Hey, thanks a lot.
[483:41.98]Thanks a lot, cops that should not be in the game.
[483:46.13]Thanks a lot.
[483:46.59]Appreciate it.
[484:01.50]Bart Simpson at your service.
[484:56.87]Oh my god, you have to go on the wrong side of the fucking road to get these!
[485:02.79]it's just how are you reliably supposed to do that Jesus Christ you gotta you have to go on the uh
[485:31.13]A ten-year-old is supposed to beat this game?
[485:32.87]How?
[485:33.53]No, this game is designed for, like, people that I don't even know who it's designed for.
[485:55.71]You made for fans of the show?
[485:57.51]What?
[485:57.91]No way!
[486:01.01]Bingo!
[486:02.20]It's time for some road games.
[486:04.24]I'm just gonna try and finish up.
[486:05.56]No, I'm not.
[486:10.90]You got it!
[486:26.33]Didn't get it again.
[486:29.67]I just don't hit people.
[486:32.83]I do.
[486:33.15]I'm stuck in a fucking infinite time loop, Bart.
[486:38.61]Collecting popcorn machines.
[486:59.84]fucking pumped into it.
[487:00.80]Like, trying to avoid the people and you bump into a fucking trash can.
[487:06.10]Now I know why you guys wanted me to play this game.
[487:08.54]Because you await- you wanted me to play this game because you know that this- that this shit is gonna make me scream.
[487:14.71]This is why this is the most requested game.
[487:17.45]Alright, I figured it out.
[487:22.35]I get it.
[487:27.81]Fine by me!
[487:34.67]He wanted to watch me drive with a minute and 40 seconds.
[487:42.25]To run through the front of the floor machines.
[487:47.13]Whoa, got him!
[487:50.89]How'd you like a new plane rough side your head?
[488:03.25]I'm trying to not hit these people, but they're just all in the way, and I have to get the police after me every time.
[488:10.55]Oh, man.
[488:19.38]Oh, man, that sucks ammo.
[488:22.02]We've been around goddamn oncoming traffic.
[488:29.81]Yeah, open the door, please.
[488:34.49]I'm running out of time.
[488:51.58]I got no time for this.
[488:56.12]All the fucking sirens are blowing my brains out here!
[489:00.20]They're just like, I can't even hear myself dream.
[489:04.42]Pops again.
[489:30.99]It's all good.
[489:32.57]I didn't do it.
[489:36.51]It's right here!
[489:37.89]No!
[489:38.43]Come on, just a few more.
[489:44.15]No problemo.
[489:45.33]Is this shortcut?
[489:46.55]Oh, oh, oh.
[489:47.71]Oh my god.
[489:48.83]Time to lay some rubber down.
[490:01.27]Take that!
[490:11.60]Lisa did it!
[490:17.40]Jump to light speed!
[490:19.58]Come on, fucking cops.
[490:21.72]Hey!
[490:22.12]Watch out!
[490:23.44]Slow down!
[490:27.56]You mean there's more?
[490:31.04]I know, Bart.
[490:32.78]We've lived through this life before.
[490:34.88]Watch the master.
[490:39.18]This is too cool for school.
[490:41.71]You think I'm scared?
[490:47.27]You thought wrong.
[490:52.51]Look out.
[490:52.99]This is not fair.
[490:59.98]Jeremy, please.
[491:01.62]You have it.
[491:02.44]It's right here.
[491:03.42]I didn't even get the wrench.
[491:09.41]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[491:16.33]I gotta go up the jump, don't I?
[491:17.29]You better run.
[491:26.11]You haven't seen the last of me.
[491:36.32]The guy's gonna explode!
[491:40.00]The guy's gonna explode.
[491:42.44]Oh!
[492:07.66]You have to take the shortcut on the beach.
[492:10.48]Otherwise, it's physically not possible to complete this mission.
[492:14.14]Right?
[492:15.74]But you have to go down on the beach.
[492:17.51]Or this is just... It will not ever happen.
[492:29.01]Fucking video games, man.
[492:31.23]I swear to God.
[492:33.15]Fucking video games.
[492:37.90]I'm so sick of this happening!
[492:44.89]This is a little zone!
[492:51.41]Hey, watch out!
[492:52.55]It's all good.
[492:54.37]What is this placement of cars?
[492:57.38]Hey, I'm a robot!
[493:04.57]Again, the same guy.
[493:11.27]Same guy just sitting parked on the corner.
[493:13.91]Not even on the road.
[493:14.63]Alright, on the beach.
[493:17.93]Here we go.
[493:25.33]You dumbass.
[493:30.46]Oh my fucking god, why are these... Why are the police in the fucking game?
[493:38.86]Why are they in the game?
[493:41.10]They don't serve a purpose!
[493:44.13]It's just to be annoying!
[493:45.37]Oh...
[494:11.71]If I didn't get crushed by the police officer going 200 miles per hour.
[494:24.30]Did the people that made this fucking level... ...have, like, a fucking bot complete it before they pushed it through?
[494:32.68]You know what I mean?
[494:34.52]Did they just run an algorithm that completed the level?
[494:37.46]They're like, yeah, that's good.
[494:42.77]Hey, did the bot make it with one second left?
[494:44.75]Yeah, that's fine.
[494:45.65]Good shit.
[494:49.85]God, I love this show.
[494:54.81]Oh, that was so cool.
[494:56.69]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[494:58.82]Watch the master.
[495:06.82]Remember the time when Homer got stuck in a dunk tank?
[495:14.60]Fuck.
[495:17.96]It's alright, you get the same amount of time.
[495:32.63]Alright, here we go.
[495:35.35]We missed the fucking wrench.
[495:45.74]Almost blew it there with that stupid RNG of, when is the thing gonna close?
[495:53.97]See, I tried.
[495:56.59]Oh man, I wanted to go down on the beach.
[495:58.99]But the thing, it's just, how do you even determine where you're gonna end up?
[496:02.59]I didn't do it.
[496:13.65]I'll have to go through the boat, too, don't I?
[496:15.59]I don't even remember.
[496:18.23]I need to, like, look at where that shortcut is, because it's... You have to be perfect and use every fucking shortcut.
[496:24.95]You have to be perfect and use every shortcut.
[496:26.83]Where is it?
[496:32.14]I need to go look at it, because when you're driving a thousand miles per hour and there's shit happening all around you, I can't pay attention to all that stuff at the same time.
[496:41.76]Like, where is it?
[496:52.47]I need to go, I'm just gonna, I need to go look at it.
[496:54.14]Because this is, this is like, outrageous.
[497:00.28]Even if I fail, I just want to see where it is.
[497:02.02]I almost had it that other time too, but I didn't get screwed over.
[497:37.33]Don't run people over.
[497:38.53]You know how difficult it is to do that?
[497:40.33]And collect everything in 1 minute and 40 seconds?
[497:45.25]That's almost impossible.
[497:48.94]I remember these being here before.
[498:00.01]Oh my god.
[498:01.13]Why?
[498:02.03]Why?
[498:03.37]Why?
[498:04.26]God.
[498:05.56]The three dumb motherfucking sedans.
[498:08.90]Why are you?
[498:11.84]And what?
[498:15.88]And I went over.
[498:16.74]How the fuck is that even possible?
[498:20.03]I went over the wrench.
[498:22.75]I don't know.
[498:24.03]I need to go look at this shit.
[498:24.95]I need to go see.
[498:25.99]Oh my god.
[498:26.77]This is unbearable.
[498:32.26]No mission in the whole game is compared to how horrible this is.
[498:38.10]I don't even care if I lose.
[498:39.56]I need to go look at this.
[498:41.38]Where is this shortcut?
[498:43.66]Where is it?
[498:46.44]This way?
[498:46.84]I can't even see.
[498:57.73]No problemo!
[499:04.97]I just can't even understand.
[499:07.59]How do they expect people to reliably do this?
[499:10.81]This is a really bad place.
[499:26.87]And it only gets worse from here?
[499:28.33]You mean there's more?
[499:36.38]You know, I don't give a shit about any of this stuff going on right now.
[499:39.90]I'm gonna quit the mission, and I'm gonna go find this exact route to take to do the jump.
[499:47.81]Where is it?
[499:48.19]I need to, like... Where's that, like, spot?
[500:14.14]So somebody said the boat is closed.
[500:16.19]The boat is closed.
[500:18.09]So I can't even do it in the... So why is everybody screaming at me to do this if I can't even do it in the first place?
[500:26.25]Is that for real?
[500:27.93]It is for real.
[500:34.86]It's not closed!
[500:41.29]No.
[500:42.57]No, no, no.
[500:43.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[500:44.21]No.
[500:48.28]I need to see how this connects.
[500:57.60]There's the jump.
[500:59.06]But where's the direct route from where I come off of?
[501:04.18]Not that way.
[501:05.76]So I gotta bang a left.
[501:10.11]Once I get to here... Or is it to the left?
[501:13.49]It's this little corner.
[501:14.23]What direction do I come from?
[501:22.62]Spray through here, and then you bang them right.
[501:24.60]As this starts down here...
[501:37.06]And then once you get to this with that dude up there.
[501:44.38]I get it.
[501:44.74]I get it.
[501:45.53]You put these people in the game because of Grand Theft Auto.
[501:48.41]You thought it would be great.
[501:52.37]I need to get out of the car so I can see.
[501:54.81]I want to look up.
[501:59.90]That's where the phone booth is.
[502:08.59]So I gotta take, go straight, and then bang a right.
[502:16.53]Once I get to this portion here.
[502:24.28]Because I'm going to be coming from this way, right?
[502:28.53]So if I'm going to be coming from this way, then it is just straight through where the ketchup guy is.
[502:33.95]Right through the boat.
[502:48.00]There's a way to go through here, too.
[502:50.70]There is a way to go through here.
[502:54.82]So, hold on.
[503:01.08]So, there's an alley right here, which goes straight.
[503:07.22]And then you bang a left, and then a right.
[503:22.28]I'm trying to find the speedrun tactics.
[503:23.79]I'm trying to find the complete the level, the base level.
[503:33.47]Alright, so that's where you land.
[503:37.71]This is where you land from the jump.
[503:39.47]Forget about the beach.
[503:42.41]So it's just right there.
[503:43.53]And then here.
[503:48.64]And then here.
[503:50.08]Alright, I got it.
[503:58.32]Just land... right there.
[504:05.32]Alright, I got it.
[504:07.00]Let's fucking go.
[504:07.60]I have to go back to Krusty's lab, right?
[504:16.21]I'm gonna do that.
[504:19.23]I'm gonna smash right into it.
[504:22.09]Test the boat, just to make sure?
[504:23.55]Oh, that's a good call.
[504:30.80]I didn't really go that fast.
[504:32.74]Where do you end up after this?
[504:33.66]Time to lay some rubber down.
[504:37.12]You end up right here.
[504:38.65]Oh, that saves a fucking dickload of time.
[504:49.45]Alright, Krusty.
[504:51.91]Fuck you.
[504:52.51]Krusty, I've got... You got it.
[505:00.51]Face me this way.
[505:01.47]How would you die?
[505:03.71]How would you die?
[505:06.72]I'm surprised there's still 3,200 people here watching me fail at a fucking popcorn collection again.
[505:12.36]Thanks for sticking around and dealing with my fucking rage.
[505:18.12]Hope you're having a good time.
[505:20.52]Restart.
[505:21.09]I don't even... Why?
[505:25.85]Restart.
[505:27.57]No, I don't care about this.
[505:28.99]I can do this.
[505:32.49]The part that's the problem is, once you get the 49 seconds, 50 seconds.
[505:38.95]This is not a problem at all, it's just that I need to now do the... You're gonna drive into oncoming traffic?
[505:58.69]I mean, this is kinda stupid.
[505:59.99]I'll be fair though, it is.
[506:07.90]Oh, I just... I don't even care about this.
[506:09.95]Just get me up to where I was.
[506:11.99]And... I got chunked.
[506:13.87]It's okay.
[506:17.73]Okay.
[506:19.19]There we go.
[506:19.75]Gotta go through the... That's not what I wanted to have happen right now.
[506:31.46]Here we go.
[506:36.23]Thank you for gripping out of the way.
[506:37.65]He knew.
[506:38.09]That was somebody in chat.
[506:39.35]It's time for some road games.
[506:44.71]Bart Simpson style.
[506:46.47]Whee!
[506:49.71]I blame this computer navigation system.
[506:52.49]Oh, this is too cool for school.
[506:54.51]Hey!
[506:57.32]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[506:59.08]I don't remember these being here before.
[507:01.10]It's time for some road games.
[507:03.46]Bart Simpson style.
[507:11.03]I'm not gonna make it it was not it was just so sloppy because this stupid stupid claw that comes down and crushes you look out that didn't even like help oh my god Simpson at your service this somebody just said this might be slower no it can't be
[507:43.54]Beat shortcut instead?
[507:44.74]No, let me try this again, where I... Oy vey.
[507:52.23]I can imagine being, like, 13.
[507:53.79]And, like, crying at this game.
[507:59.32]And not understanding what was wrong.
[508:02.81]Like tears streaming down my face.
[508:04.82]Because I don't get why I can't win the game, Mom.
[508:07.36]Watch out!
[508:08.46]Take that!
[508:11.92]Watch it, buddy!
[508:13.34]You think I'm scared?
[508:18.73]Thought wrong.
[508:19.67]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[508:21.09]No biggie.
[508:33.86]Hold on, wait for the fucking gong to hit.
[508:38.64]Whatever the hell that thing is.
[508:40.04]Probably some reference.
[508:47.60]Come on, Homer.
[508:48.46]Alright, stop.
[508:49.18]I'm so glad I went over that.
[509:05.33]Okay.
[509:06.79]Now slow it down.
[509:13.74]No!
[509:15.90]Oh my God!
[509:17.18]Why in the name of God do you have to do this to me?
[509:22.64]You have to go straight in.
[509:24.46]It's actually hard to do that.
[509:28.08]It's actually hard to do that.
[509:31.00]That is as wide as this car is.
[509:35.15]That's as wide as the car!
[509:37.03]Oh my fucking god.
[509:42.33]I'm gonna get out there and fucking just crawl.
[509:50.45]Oh, I'm so... I'm turning into ice right now.
[509:57.47]I can just feel my body cooling.
[510:02.35]Like the devil is taking over.
[510:10.75]I can't skip it because I know this sucks, but I have to do this It's as wide as the car Oh Satan leave me Satan leave me now It's all good
[510:40.78]I'm never gonna watch The Simpsons on Netflix.
[511:01.08]Ever.
[511:01.56]Oh, you're never getting a view from me on Netflix.
[511:13.80]Hohohoho!
[511:33.02]Oh my god, you understand this, right?
[511:38.02]Look at this.
[511:41.11]It's actually gonna be just a stroke of luck for me to fit in there.
[511:47.60]No problemo!
[511:50.66]beach, go on the beach.
[511:51.54]No, everyone told me to do this.
[511:53.61]Everybody said, Jeremy, you gotta go through the alley.
[511:55.83]Try the alley and then try the boat.
[511:57.53]I know you guys are trying to help me.
[511:58.73]Alright, I really appreciate it.
[512:00.05]I do, but I'm trying.
[512:05.21]I'm trying.
[512:06.09]First we're gonna try the beach, now we try the boat.
[512:09.12]I do appreciate it.
[512:10.36]I do.
[512:10.62]Thank you.
[512:12.42]But... Satan, leave me!
[512:24.11]Begone Satan Ignore the alley
[512:39.16]but my puny six-year-old brain.
[512:43.90]That's the only thing I know what to do now.
[512:45.24]I don't know how to do anything else right now.
[512:46.92]It's just to just go to that alleyway and go through.
[512:49.76]That's the only thing my brain can do.
[512:58.73]Okay, hold on.
[513:00.19]I'm gonna get it now.
[513:00.83]I'm gonna get it now.
[513:01.63]I'll get it now.
[513:02.31]Right now.
[513:04.01]Just gotta hit every single tree on the way over there.
[513:05.85]Here we go.
[513:06.25]Relax.
[513:08.15]No cops.
[513:10.31]I'll get it.
[513:11.61]I promise.
[513:12.85]Or I'm going to do 500 push-ups.
[513:15.73]You almost hit a person.
[513:31.19]I didn't do it.
[513:36.99]I got it!
[513:37.81]I got it!
[513:38.25]I got it!
[513:38.71]I got it!
[513:39.05]I got it!
[513:39.31]I got it!
[513:39.55]I got it!
[513:39.81]I got it!
[513:40.11]I got it!
[513:40.37]It's time for some road rage, Bart Simpson style.
[513:55.28]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[513:57.49]Come on, just a few more seconds.
[514:19.50]You've had it.
[514:21.56]Don't... I... That didn't count, because the 500 push-ups, only if I fuck up.
[514:28.10]That didn't count.
[514:29.53]That doesn't count as a fuck-up for me.
[514:30.93]That counts as a fuck-up from the video game, dropping the school paper cutter on me.
[514:38.51]That didn't count as a fuckup either.
[514:39.53]He's not a fuckup yet.
[514:58.46]I've gone off the rails.
[515:03.28]Skip one.
[515:04.58]Skip one of the popcorns.
[515:07.06]What do you mean skip a popcorn?
[515:09.54]Is it more than 25?
[515:10.90]Beach.
[515:11.34]Alright, I'm going to go beach this time.
[515:31.32]I'm going to go for beach, but I don't know where it ends up.
[515:35.03]I'm gonna play calm.
[515:36.27]You understand?
[515:38.09]I'm calm.
[515:39.27]I just gotta get up there.
[515:40.29]I got plenty of time.
[515:42.41]I'm gonna fucking start.
[515:43.81]I'm gonna start slamming things.
[515:45.90]No.
[515:46.42]Stay calm.
[515:48.32]I'm not even gonna get him.
[515:54.28]Nice one.
[515:54.78]Alright.
[515:56.38]That was so cool.
[515:57.48]This is a really
[516:01.80]Stay calm.
[516:11.18]Time to lay some rubber down.
[516:14.56]You mean there's more?
[516:24.89]Jump to light speed.
[516:41.93]It's always right there!
[516:43.76]I can get it.
[517:08.22]Why is this game so hard?
[517:10.40]Why is this game like this?
[517:13.17]Is this one of those secret hard games?
[517:15.43]Tell me the truth.
[517:16.43]This is one of those secret hard games, right?
[517:19.39]Where the game is... Holy shit, it's secret hard game.
[517:24.31]Right?
[517:24.61]It is?
[517:25.47]Please?
[517:26.51]Please, tell me.
[517:28.37]This game was made for children.
[517:34.74]Stop that.
[517:36.54]Enough of that.
[517:38.21]How am I doing that?
[517:39.59]How is the car doing this?
[517:43.79]I need a fresh start here.
[517:51.02]Skip number 22.
[517:51.68]Skip 22.
[517:51.96]Thank you for the help.
[517:56.32]Skip 22.
[517:56.70]I'll try.
[517:57.00]I'm going to skip 22.
[518:11.46]It's the one that comes after 21.
[518:13.84]It's the one that comes after 21.
[518:34.76]Wee!
[518:35.72]Who did that?
[518:37.46]Who said that?
[518:37.92]You think I'm scared?
[518:39.60]You thought wrong.
[518:40.34]I am so sick of this happening!
[518:44.60]Bring it on, suckers!
[518:46.46]My butt hurts.
[518:47.32]18, 19... 20... 21... But 22 is right here!
[518:50.12]22 is easy to get!
[519:08.03]Alright.
[519:12.71]It's not gonna... No, no, because look, when I activate the next part, when I get the 25th one, it just goes to 50 seconds.
[519:20.23]I don't think it matters when you pick C-Watch.
[519:21.67]Ready?
[519:22.91]50, right?
[519:24.09]It's not like it matters when I pick them up.
[519:28.33]Or am I not getting this somehow?
[519:45.08]This is the one.
[519:45.70]This is the one.
[519:46.86]Again, this is the one.
[520:16.55]Nice driving, man.
[520:17.55]I think I just seltzered myself.
[520:28.18]Why didn't I just do this in the first place?
[520:30.66]Why didn't I know that showgirl last night was a guy?
[520:34.32]Hindsight's always 20-20.
[520:35.94]That was for you, Feedy.
[520:37.98]45 minutes ago.
[520:47.27]For the record, 20- skipping 22, what would it do?
[520:51.55]There's more to this game.
[520:56.09]What the fuck do you want me to do now?
[521:03.88]I wasn't paying attention.
[521:06.48]Save, save, save, yeah, yeah, oh, yep, yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[521:13.92]Save for the love of God.
[521:14.92]Okay, why?
[521:15.58]Is there a problem here?
[521:17.21]You get 22 last and the way back we're setting the timer.
[521:21.57]Oh.
[521:25.26]What is this?
[521:30.48]Is it in the studio?
[521:31.92]Where is this person?
[521:38.44]Maybe... Okay.
[521:49.31]Eat my dust, Dust Eater.
[521:51.13]6iqBoomer doesn't believe this chat.
[521:52.96]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[521:55.79]I didn't know that it... Look, I didn't know it was the super cheat exploit way to do it.
[521:59.83]That's an exploit.
[522:01.47]I read on the Wikipedia page for Simpsons Hit and Run that the developers were really upset that people were doing the Collect 22 last, because it fucked with their only bots can complete this algorithm.
[522:14.22]So, I mean... I'm sorry, but that's what I read.
[522:35.84]No.
[522:37.16]I was thinking about it.
[522:38.68]No, not at this stage.
[522:41.32]I got one more mission.
[522:43.50]Okay, hold on a minute.
[522:45.27]Like three hours ago, somebody said I had two more missions.
[522:49.91]There's been probably 14 missions.
[523:03.10]Two more levels.
[523:04.63]Two more chapters.
[523:10.00]Hold on.
[523:14.43]I only have $21.
[523:15.69]God, Jerma is fucking... Amxing.
[523:17.47]What's up?
[523:47.50]Race the aliens.
[523:52.49]Oh, amazing.
[523:53.37]Oh, thank you.
[523:54.77]I appreciate that.
[524:04.19]This car sucks bullshit.
[524:05.89]It does.
[524:07.15]This car su- This car is bullshit.
[524:08.79]This car sucks, is what I'm trying to say.
[524:13.37]Ow, my ass!
[524:14.76]I hope that was expensive.
[524:18.02]What?
[524:20.34]Look out!
[524:24.10]I regret nothing!
[524:26.18]I'm a lean, mean speed thingy!
[524:29.07]Eat my dust, dust eater!
[524:43.97]Why does it put me in front of this lip?
[524:50.66]Why would you do this to me?
[524:51.98]This thing goes up on two wheels so easily.
[525:11.73]And that guy's blocking the secret.
[525:14.25]He's doing that.
[525:14.99]You see what I'm talking about?
[525:15.99]I had a choice.
[525:17.65]Homer, shut the fuck up!
[525:29.28]Homer, shut up!
[525:30.54]Stop it!
[525:31.18]Stop it, Homer!
[525:49.68]He's breaking.
[525:50.40]No, he's not.
[525:51.24]He's fine.
[525:51.84]He's doing just fine.
[525:57.12]It's not the line that gets me.
[525:58.44]It's the... He just said, learn to drive, dumbass.
[526:02.20]I ain't never watching your show.
[526:10.37]I heard it's a classic American piece of television.
[526:12.61]No, I ain't watching it.
[526:14.45]Why did I do the same thing you just did?
[526:18.05]We're doing the same things.
[526:22.91]Why didn't I just pass you?
[526:40.13]I'm gonna lose.
[526:42.75]He crashes into that thing every time.
[526:44.35]I just need to go around it.
[526:45.19]But it's hard to go around it because the beach is not desirable ground.
[526:52.44]Sweet!
[526:54.00]Fine by me!
[526:54.68]I have no insurance!
[527:00.23]Hope that didn't break my memory card.
[527:09.65]Nothing lasts forever.
[527:13.15]Somebody go the other way at the start, and I listen to him.
[527:15.93]Let's do this thing!
[527:17.23]No problemo!
[527:18.31]Stay on target!
[527:19.29]Stay on target!
[527:20.35]Let's do this thing!
[527:22.13]Hey, you were supposed to eat my dust!
[527:29.95]I got braked.
[527:31.11]He braked at the worst possible time.
[527:37.30]Hey, what's up with that?
[527:43.14]He'll fuck it up, don't worry.
[527:44.16]He always does.
[527:44.66]I'm going over the edge.
[527:49.10]I'm going over.
[527:50.48]No I'm not, no I'm not.
[527:51.34]Just go around him.
[527:53.74]Crashes every time, went around, and this is where I win.
[527:57.74]Unbelievable, I fucking can't believe it.
[528:03.22]He just, his character just, look at how much faster his car is right now.
[528:08.00]He just goes 5,000 miles per hour in 5 seconds, and I lose again.
[528:12.10]Look at how much faster the car is.
[528:20.60]From crashing into the wall, he goes 80.
[528:42.57]It's crashing time!
[528:43.85]Take him through the boat.
[528:44.68]Bart Simpson at your service.
[528:47.50]Damn it, I dropped my kebab.
[528:58.07]See, he's always faster than me, so he always causes a fucking bunch of shit in front of me.
[529:02.13]This is an unfair race.
[529:04.75]It's not even a race, it's, hey, I'm just gonna go in front of you and crash into everything, and then you're gonna have to deal with the outcome.
[529:10.94]I'm ahead of him.
[529:15.58]Oh, he... Yes!
[529:18.66]He's not even... Don't do it!
[529:21.15]Go!
[529:21.65]Down to the beach!
[529:22.43]Down to the beach!
[529:24.48]There's no way he's catching up.
[529:26.05]He fucked up.
[529:27.41]Bad.
[529:28.77]Discompose yourself.
[529:33.89]I win.
[529:34.49]I did it.
[529:35.05]Oh, I win.
[529:35.73]Oh, yeah.
[529:36.01]Where's the finish line?
[529:37.59]OK.
[530:02.21]I told you to do that five minutes ago while I wasn't looking.
[530:04.99]This game sucks.
[530:38.37]That's just somebody wrote.
[530:40.15]I... Oh, this is fucking hilarious.
[530:57.19]What a stream, man.
[530:58.17]I went from, like, fun to...
[531:01.52]To joking, to anger, to now I'm, this, I'm fucking, this is hilarious to me.
[531:07.12]It's not done?
[531:10.65]This is DLC.
[531:11.33]This is a Halloween DLC.
[531:12.43]I don't have to do this.
[531:18.88]Hey, thank, I beat the game.
[531:20.16]This is the fucking Halloween skeleton DLC.
[531:28.24]Dad, the zombies are on the way.
[531:30.84]Shouldn't we do something?
[531:32.66]No, Lisa, I'm trying to listen to the baseball game.
[531:35.56]It's the top of the seventh and... Oh, God!
[531:38.34]Zombies!
[531:39.14]They're devouring the crowd!
[531:40.95]Now they're eating my brain!
[531:43.41]Oh, the pain!
[531:46.39]You can tell he's mad because you haven't done any of the extra stuff like you were doing in the beginning.
[531:50.65]No, not anymore.
[531:51.43]We go through stages.
[531:59.17]Are you gonna give me a time limit to go talk to Flanders?
[532:02.82]You can't do that.
[532:06.22]This is DLC.
[532:09.95]What the hell is going on?
[532:12.72]Landers, give me your first aid kit.
[532:14.68]Well, I was hoping to save it for Rotter and Totter to, you know, bandage their brain-eater boo-boos.
[532:19.82]Look, just rub a Bible on them.
[532:21.51]Will that work to fend off zombies?
[532:23.17]Who am I, Dr. Science?
[532:24.93]Oakley, Oakley, here's the first aid kit.
[532:26.91]Daddy, if the zombies are dead, why aren't they in heaven?
[532:30.75]I hope my brain feeds a poor, hungry zombie.
[532:38.31]What's with the camera?
[532:39.51]Hey, I need something to board up the windows.
[532:42.15]I just threw up.
[532:43.19]Oh my god.
[532:44.31]What's the disease?
[532:45.33]I have to... Coming through!
[532:55.74]Oh!
[533:19.52]This whole thing is timed, but it's not, but it is, but it isn't, but... Where's my car?
[533:26.80]Flanders, get... I need to get my car out.
[533:29.04]Oh my, just give me the car.
[533:30.00]Just give me a car because...
[533:42.11]Why won't you... You have to have the time limit here before I even have a car.
[533:46.35]I have so many locked cars.
[533:51.56]Where's that cool one?
[533:56.28]Give me this one.
[533:56.92]Alright, that's... Okay, that's... Can I make it from... I don't think I can make it from here.
[534:15.01]I've never even seen inside of here before.
[534:17.55]This is the first time I've seen inside the cemetery.
[534:22.73]I don't know what it looked like in here.
[534:26.29]How am I supposed to know what it looked like in there?
[534:30.16]Is the car at least there?
[534:34.32]It is.
[534:36.02]Oh my god.
[534:36.96]Talk to Flint.
[534:37.86]I need the car!
[534:44.65]Landers, zoom my camera in and make me throw up.
[535:05.29]I don't oh I think I broke something okay I know I know what the inside of the cemetery looks like now oh my goodness
[535:29.25]So glad to be of service.
[535:30.95]I get hit by more cars than anyone I know.
[535:35.97]So, how's that special class going?
[535:44.06]It's 12... How long have I been playing the game for?
[535:46.50]What?
[535:46.64]Getting raided.
[535:47.24]Where's the raid?
[535:47.91]Where's the raid?
[535:48.55]Where's the raid?
[535:49.75]There's a raid?
[535:50.43]2,200 fucking people just came in?
[536:15.14]Other side.
[536:15.84]This isn't the short bus.
[536:19.02]Holy shit.
[536:20.71]It was Nova.
[536:23.01]Oh, what's up, dude?
[536:27.47]Thanks for the free.
[536:28.93]A lot of people are probably going to leave immediately.
[536:31.53]Because I've been swearing.
[536:33.39]I've been saying bad fucking words.
[536:37.02]Like, why would that matter?
[536:41.02]I'm playing Simpsons Hit and Run.
[536:42.10]I'm having a tough time.
[536:43.08]Do I have to do the whole thing again?
[536:55.72]Welcome, everyone.
[536:56.42]No, for real.
[536:57.64]Thanks for the raid.
[536:58.80]I have to do the whole thing again?
[537:01.06]No!
[537:01.66]Why?
[537:04.97]Having a hard time playing a children's game.
[537:07.39]It's not a chil- We've come to the conclusion this is not a children's game.
[537:10.25]This is a game for... robots.
[537:14.56]Only.
[537:15.66]Because they're the only ones that can fucking complete these things.
[537:26.49]Sweet!
[537:28.49]Give me the car.
[537:31.98]There's cheat codes to drive fast?
[537:33.48]I can't do that.
[537:34.12]I gotta do it legitimately.
[537:39.08]Here we go.
[537:40.20]Blanders.
[537:42.10]Give me your first aid kit.
[537:44.58]Let's go.
[537:48.02]It's just so many tiny... There's so much small... I can't... Words are not coming out right.
[537:54.57]They're just not...
[537:57.81]That was so lucky.
[537:58.97]I can't.
[537:59.61]Words.
[537:59.83]Let's go through the secret entrance.
[538:01.59]Here we go.
[538:02.61]Alright.
[538:04.53]Done.
[538:04.73]Aim the car the correct way.
[538:06.75]I'm gonna go back this way.
[538:28.87]Here we go.
[538:29.91]I need your chainsaw.
[538:30.77]Get it.
[538:31.07]And here we go.
[538:32.03]Run!
[538:32.81]40 seconds.
[538:35.11]Get in the car!
[538:37.06]That took 5 seconds.
[538:38.32]That was not f- That was a ton of time.
[538:50.54]Should've went in the cemetery.
[538:51.48]I should've gone in the cemetery.
[538:56.53]But I didn't know.
[539:04.82]It's fine, I did it.
[539:06.16]We're good, everything's fine.
[539:11.62]Drive to the school playground.
[539:13.05]I'm driving like there's still a time limit, but there's not.
[539:18.27]I just gotta relax.
[539:25.98]No.
[539:27.20]The music is too stressful.
[539:31.46]It really is.
[539:32.82]Help Smithers find the items for Mr. Burns before the time runs out.
[539:36.83]Find the socks.
[539:56.09]First, let me walk around while my son drives.
[540:23.92]T-pose.
[540:25.08]You got it.
[540:25.62]You got your T-pose after 10 hours of streaming.
[540:38.50]Here you go, Mr. Smithers.
[540:40.28]Oh, thank God.
[540:41.26]His socks have been pooling around his ankle all day.
[540:43.90]This is his favorite brand.
[540:45.04]Alan Quartermain's Keep'em Ups.
[540:46.54]Hmm.
[540:47.32]What next?
[540:51.68]Why can't I just get them all?
[540:52.84]Why do I have to do this again?
[540:53.96]Alright, get it again.
[540:55.04]Do it again.
[541:28.42]Camera, why are you over here like this?
[541:30.20]What the f... What?
[541:31.80]And how do you... How do you get that one in 10 seconds?
[541:36.34]Nope.
[541:43.90]Drive.
[541:47.98]Optional, don't do it.
[541:48.86]Don't do it, man.
[541:57.12]Are there new costumes?
[541:59.74]That's interesting.
[542:04.60]Dirty Homer.
[542:06.68]Evil Homer.
[542:14.17]I don't like that noise.
[542:23.13]What is something that people do at the beach?
[542:27.78]Um.
[542:29.30]Uh.
[542:31.00]Eat.
[542:32.40]I say eat.
[542:35.56]That was not worth it.
[542:49.59]Mr. Smith.
[542:51.85]Sweet.
[542:55.61]Woohoo!
[542:56.63]I love senselessly pushing things!
[543:04.83]Here you go, miss.
[543:07.08]Well, it's about time.
[543:08.56]You're as dumb as a bag of hair.
[543:10.60]Shovel over!
[543:11.54]Ooh, nice one!
[543:12.26]Takes five seconds to get him to get up.
[543:15.94]Jump to light speed!
[543:23.77]Just go to the school for crying out loud.
[543:27.27]Whoa!
[543:28.91]We're just gonna go to the school.
[543:39.08]Because we're going on ten hours here.
[543:44.74]I didn't do it.
[543:45.24]Oh, awesome, man!
[543:46.58]That was the best ride ever!
[543:53.53]Make sure I save it.
[544:05.44]Okay.
[544:35.89]So it was... the giant flying saucer is probably an indicator of where I need to go.
[544:57.09]But hold on.
[544:58.97]Cool.
[544:59.97]Hey, you there.
[545:00.91]Smelly Sam.
[545:01.47]What's going on?
[545:02.07]Get Homer's green car.
[545:02.87]The alien craft is using some sort of tractor beam to suck up trespassers to their doom.
[545:08.17]Worst effects ever.
[545:10.19]But that's real.
[545:11.37]Worst effects ever.
[545:13.65]What's with the cool black car?
[545:15.11]My knowledge of sci-fi movies is correct, which it is.
[545:18.71]The black car is an advanced probe for the mothership.
[545:21.76]Now, if you're through, I will spend my last hours on Earth complaining about movies on the Internet.
[545:26.68]The gift of life is wasted on you.
[545:29.38]Yes, I recommend you obtain a zombie car.
[545:32.06]It will protect you well, but it runs on human brains.
[545:36.17]Slight drawback.
[545:37.29]I got plenty of those.
[545:40.89]You need the zombie car purchased from the zombie at the Springfield Cemetery for 500 coins, or call it from a phone booth if you already have it.
[545:51.48]Well.
[545:53.62]I don't think I have that money yet.
[545:55.02]But I can go down the slide and maybe collect some cash.
[546:01.04]Something... I think something's supposed to just scare me right there.
[546:02.82]Is there a spider there?
[546:17.09]Well, I gotta jump from here.
[546:26.74]500?
[546:26.86]I... I really... okay.
[546:32.82]Where do I get some money?
[546:43.41]Human cookbook.
[546:50.11]Can't grab the spider or anything?
[546:51.27]Alright, look for boxes.
[546:56.10]Don't play hit and run at 3 AM.
[546:59.72]Well, I'm fairly committed.
[547:02.14]So, I'm going to get to the end of this tonight.
[547:05.91]This might be like a 12 hour stream.
[547:08.39]If it takes that long.
[547:09.11]I'm committed.
[547:10.43]We're already here.
[547:14.20]You know, I'm sitting right here.
[547:25.33]Because I'm so close.
[547:32.37]And I'm currently addicted to the game, even though it's infuriating.
[547:42.27]And I've probably lost two or three hundred hairs.
[547:46.72]Just normally, because I'm starting to lose my hair a little bit, but... I mean, it's been about twelve hours, so that's how many hairs I lose in about ten to twelve hours.
[547:56.43]But the game's really frustrating, you know?
[547:58.33]That too.
[548:03.95]Anything else over here?
[548:05.91]I'm gonna be Homer by the end of the stream.
[548:13.52]Big money on the roof of the school.
[548:19.14]I just... Get out of the way, I want the coin that's in here.
[548:23.86]On the roof of the school, and there looks to be a place to go.
[548:31.70]Can you get up there?
[548:34.00]There's no ledge I can stay on here?
[548:38.29]Seems like it should be there.
[548:55.73]Try one more time.
[549:00.60]Got it.
[549:04.16]That was a little more difficult than it should have been.
[549:07.64]But I made it.
[549:08.86]Double jump?
[549:09.28]Yeah, I was trying to.
[549:12.18]I was pressing the input.
[549:14.63]Uh, there was one little bit.
[549:25.50]What about up here?
[549:32.85]Bug?
[549:34.91]No bug?
[549:36.01]Oh, this doesn't run something over this way.
[549:52.74]There are a lot of boxes here.
[549:54.90]Very good.
[549:55.36]Yeah, I would have just jumped off, but I was kind of scared that there was going to be nothing underneath me.
[550:13.11]Beautiful.
[550:16.13]Still not quite there.
[550:20.47]What do these do?
[550:21.07]Can these blow you?
[550:24.57]That startled me.
[550:26.45]I knew it was going to happen, but I just, for some reason, was not expecting it.
[550:29.72]Alright.
[550:30.54]A little bit more.
[550:43.20]Is it because I'm drunk?
[550:48.53]I've been, I've, all I've had is, I've had a Coca-Cola, a ginger ale, and water.
[551:05.58]There we go.
[551:09.74]Three thirty-nine, three ninety, I can't read that number.
[551:15.76]Three ninety-four.
[551:24.07]What over here?
[551:27.07]Something over there?
[551:27.85]Probably.
[551:34.21]Can I change music tracks?
[551:37.81]This is giving me extra anxiety playing the game.
[551:49.28]Alright, it's... You know what?
[551:51.44]I've been... I've been on the internet for too long.
[551:55.02]That's a gnome.
[551:55.74]That's what I thought that was.
[551:57.92]I thought that was a gnome or something and somebody modded it in.
[552:03.75]But online for too long.
[552:04.97]Alright.
[552:12.47]This looks like there's something could be back here.
[552:18.23]Yes.
[552:22.45]440!
[552:24.07]So close.
[552:30.68]Can't get over there?
[552:31.20]Has Jerma done anything silly in the last 10 minutes, guys?
[552:48.10]I don't think so.
[552:58.51]No, I don't believe so.
[553:12.92]Well, I see a lot of shit over there.
[553:22.20]What is that thing?
[553:25.52]There's a little go-kart over there.
[553:34.47]Huh.
[553:38.27]That's not gonna knock me into the air?
[553:39.59]Do I have to jump with a car?
[553:45.52]No, I got it.
[553:46.02]Let me get this first.
[553:46.72]This thing is tiny!
[554:05.21]500?
[554:05.45]Not quite.
[554:05.97]This thing is cooler than it... How do you say the thing I'm trying to say?
[554:29.67]This thing looks cool, but...
[554:33.33]I don't know.
[554:33.95]Alright, back to where we were.
[554:41.87]I'm gonna go talk to... Where was I going before?
[554:47.77]I thought I got gnomed and that's the correct way this way, right?
[554:50.29]Nope.
[555:04.71]Cemetery?
[555:05.21]Is it on my right?
[555:13.01]No, I remember this shit.
[555:14.61]I have to go back up that way, don't I?
[555:16.07]I have to, like, jump.
[555:18.93]Can I jump this and get all the way back where I was?
[555:31.14]I remember this.
[555:42.83]Wrong way, wrong way, wrong... going the wrong way?
[555:44.77]Wrong way!
[555:47.44]No, I'm not.
[555:47.90]It's right here.
[555:48.32]Isn't there somebody I can buy it off of here?
[555:54.56]Eat my dust!
[555:57.20]Oh, right.
[555:58.16]Okay.
[555:58.68]No, this is just where Bart was.
[555:59.96]Woohoo!
[556:03.50]Just call me Air Homer!
[556:09.77]Mistakes were made!
[556:16.76]Your brain is fried.
[556:19.92]I'm alright.
[556:20.54]I'll be good for another five minutes.
[556:22.74]Alright, cemetery.
[556:27.72]Yes, I thought that was a hill.
[556:29.24]All hills are green.
[556:32.90]I didn't do it.
[556:43.23]There's a witch up there.
[556:48.38]No, all... Yeah, all hills are... That's what I meant to say.
[556:51.17]I thought I could drive up... Where the hell is the cemetery?
[557:02.56]I don't even know if I'm close or not.
[557:11.05]Is it back here?
[557:25.99]Driving in circles.
[557:28.81]Give me my blip.
[557:29.97]I just want my blip on the map.
[557:32.87]That's all I need.
[557:35.66]You passed it again.
[557:43.28]It's the thing next to the fire truck.
[557:45.62]Okay, can you please get off of me?
[557:49.88]You're not gonna get more?
[558:05.88]Uh, my brain might be too fried for this.
[558:10.35]By the fire truck.
[558:11.49]The fire truck's right here.
[558:26.12]One guy was trolling me.
[558:27.30]Alright, you ready?
[558:30.85]I'm gonna go this way.
[558:32.51]And then I'm taking a left.
[558:41.09]Yes Wrong way wait didn't you guys just say left I said what wait hold on Wait what?
[559:01.89]It is left
[559:11.85]Not the wrong way.
[559:17.91]Why wouldn't they just put an indicator on the map?
[559:20.41]They have it for everything else.
[559:27.79]Alright, I'm going left here.
[559:29.16]Sure.
[559:45.73]Alright, I'm going left here.
[559:47.27]Alright.
[559:56.45]Alright, I'm going left here.
[560:15.51]Reckless driving is my pet peeve.
[560:25.64]Oh, man.
[560:29.24]Oh, it's by the fire truck.
[560:31.86]Where's the alien car heading?
[560:44.13]No, I can't save it here.
[560:51.03]At this stage in the game, I wish they would just delete all the cards.
[560:53.57]Look at all these people.
[560:55.97]Like, these are just witches flying around.
[560:57.69]There's people rowing boats on the road.
[561:08.94]Missing shortcuts.
[561:10.28]It don't even matter.
[561:10.98]I'm gonna first try this mission.
[561:15.44]If I first try this mission, I'm going in the Discord and I'm going in the voice chat and I want to hear people screaming.
[561:20.73]No, it's way too late for that shit.
[561:24.84]It's like 4 in the morning.
[561:26.34]Never mind.
[561:43.26]Follow the alien car.
[561:44.44]We don't even give you one second to even get your bearings.
[561:55.06]You just, you just, go.
[561:56.89]We should start.
[561:57.65]Time.
[561:58.05]Go.
[561:58.45]Now.
[561:58.79]Go.
[561:59.17]Go.
[561:59.57]Go.
[562:05.53]Where is this gonna put me?
[562:10.07]Thank god.
[562:29.06]Just go.
[562:32.04]Why?
[562:32.76]Just drive around me.
[562:36.06]I have to move out of the way.
[562:37.30]He's just gonna drive into me.
[562:42.91]Alright, GET OUT OF THE FUCKING STREET!
[562:57.39]Just gotta stay with him, that's it.
[563:02.04]Park did it.
[563:17.02]Those boats just look like I can drive through them.
[563:21.28]I should be able to.
[563:22.06]If they're ghost boats, why can't I just drive through them?
[563:31.76]I don't understand.
[563:39.35]What was that?
[563:41.37]What happened to the car?
[563:42.37]Why did I do that?
[563:44.89]Sorry.
[563:45.63]Didn't fail.
[563:52.46]I am Evil Homer.
[563:54.36]I am Evil Homer.
[563:56.28]Shut up, Homer!
[563:57.84]I am Evil Homer.
[563:59.76]I am Evil Homer.
[564:00.88]Remember when I screamed that?
[564:06.33]Watch it.
[564:07.01]I almost spilled my sundae.
[564:09.91]Talk to Professor Frink.
[564:12.45]Let's see.
[564:13.34]Five more.
[564:13.88]Five more?
[564:35.99]Well, it could save the life of you and your family.
[564:39.19]And?
[564:40.37]Look, I've loaded my vehicle with nuclear waste from the power plant.
[564:44.20]It's going to deliver this toxic payload to the alien ship, risking myself and my delicious brain to zombie snacking, which if you've never undergone that, I can tell you it stings.
[564:55.38]What a hero.
[564:56.72]And I never knew his name.
[564:58.88]It's Professor John Frank.
[565:00.28]Are you still here?
[565:03.48]Alright.
[565:04.26]Protect Professor Frank from the aliens.
[565:05.91]Deliver the nuclear waste to the spaceship.
[565:08.57]Let's do this thing!
[565:11.27]So I don't have to protect them.
[565:12.65]I just have to drive.
[565:14.15]Okay, just get to where I need to go.
[565:17.91]Oh, this car.
[565:18.69]Not this car.
[565:24.78]I saw the thing.
[565:25.38]I looked.
[565:28.92]Piece of cake!
[565:33.25]I didn't even see that guy.
[565:39.41]They got blended in with the ground.
[565:45.09]Did you see that?
[565:48.92]You didn't really see that guy?
[565:50.00]So many people on the road.
[566:02.17]It's like midnight.
[566:02.85]What are you doing here?
[566:05.63]I guess you could say the same thing about me.
[566:07.19]You could say the same thing about this stream right now.
[566:13.78]I don't know why.
[566:16.72]I could have just driven past, but for some reason I was like, oh, go there.
[566:20.10]Do that.
[566:21.58]Okay.
[566:32.77]Could have gone through there, too.
[566:37.83]Oh, dear.
[566:39.31]Whoa.
[566:40.62]Could have done a lot of things.
[566:43.36]Control limited.
[566:45.12]Impact imminent.
[566:46.16]Learn to drive, dumbass.
[566:47.38]Oh, boy.
[567:07.07]I feel like I've gone in a circle.
[567:09.98]I'm still going the right way, right?
[567:26.66]What?
[567:27.50]What happened?
[567:28.72]Where is it?
[567:29.14]Where is it?
[567:29.50]Where is it?
[567:29.88]Where is it?
[567:30.52]Where is it?
[567:31.02]I got it!
[567:35.59]I did it.
[567:36.03]I did it.
[567:36.55]Just... I'm not going to ask any questions.
[567:38.85]I'm just going.
[567:42.17]Glurvic?
[567:42.93]I can't seem to Glurvic.
[567:48.14]Wrench, give me that.
[567:57.44]Observe.
[567:58.34]Gravity in action.
[568:00.97]Glidey, that was big.
[568:03.97]Help!
[568:07.11]I'm not sure.
[568:07.61]Where's the indicator pointing?
[568:11.23]Oh, uh, oh boy.
[568:13.87]Take King Homer if you dare.
[568:17.59]Oh dear.
[568:18.07]Who cares about this mechanic that was put in in eight minutes?
[568:21.35]Help, it's not good.
[568:24.49]Help!
[568:35.10]This thing is so hard to drive.
[569:06.63]Slippery, sloppy thing.
[569:10.29]Alright.
[569:12.00]Did it.
[569:12.66]Good job.
[569:13.96]Drive to school.
[569:15.52]The smoke is just causing too many problems.
[569:29.99]I need a wrench.
[569:35.91]There's a wrench.
[569:41.51]I don't have time for it.
[569:44.55]There's a wrench right there too!
[569:50.95]There's a wrench right there too!
[570:13.42]How close am I?
[570:14.72]Do it!
[570:44.91]Do it!
[570:45.35]Where is this thing?
[570:46.39]Come on!
[570:47.31]It's right there!
[570:48.09]I f- oh.
[570:48.31]Thank god I just have to do this part.
[570:50.09]What the fuck was that?
[570:51.67]What?
[571:15.95]I don't get it.
[571:17.01]So you have to... This thing can explode.
[571:19.97]So this has to be driven without hitting anything.
[571:48.96]Wait, wasn't I smashing into everything before?
[571:55.80]I crashed so hard into... I... See, I'm crashing.
[572:13.74]Not enough, apparently.
[572:16.57]Get out of the way.
[572:17.17]You're in the worst possible spot.
[572:30.49]Everybody has to drive right in front of you.
[572:38.77]The placement of the other cars... It's just... Like, look at these three.
[572:45.18]Get out of the freaking... God!
[572:49.36]Out of the way!
[572:50.24]I'm going the wrong way.
[572:55.15]Thank God.
[573:02.24]Ha!
[573:02.48]Put it in the tractor beam!
[573:14.44]Okay, I did it.
[573:17.62]Jesus!
[573:18.18]Oh, I thought I was in the car!
[573:20.48]Holy shit!
[573:44.34]I can't kill a bug!
[573:50.04]Alright, that was fun.
[573:54.97]What's next?
[573:58.01]Jerma, did I... Did you find the hot dog?
[574:02.36]I don't think I found a hot dog.
[574:16.26]I hate this game.
[574:17.99]Why?
[574:19.55]Tell me your hate.
[574:21.39]Tell me your reasons, I'll tell you mine.
[574:25.20]I'm just kidding.
[574:45.19]This is the worst mission, really?
[574:46.35]Get into a vehicle.
[574:47.21]It's really, really...
[575:10.69]helpful stuff that I've been counting down already and I haven't even got outside yet.
[575:16.99]It's just... it's unnecessary stress!
[575:32.66]I can't go pick the kind of car for the mission that I wanted.
[575:35.35]No, no, no.
[575:36.03]Hurry up.
[575:36.57]Walk out and get in the car.
[575:37.53]You have 25 seconds, bud.
[575:45.04]Stay away from the alien car.
[576:13.42]I had to have lost you by now.
[576:14.70]What happened there?
[576:15.20]It's the zombies.
[576:17.78]The zombies, chief.
[576:18.88]It's not a big deal.
[576:41.25]Go over it.
[576:41.63]Just make the whole thing.
[576:42.41]Am I going to make it?
[576:43.83]I don't think so.
[576:47.37]I'm not sure I'm going to make this.
[576:50.02]No.
[576:50.12]No way.
[576:50.62]No!
[577:11.17]It's crashing time!
[577:14.73]Lousy, rotten, karmic retribution coming through!
[577:26.86]Reckless driving is my pet peeve.
[577:29.56]I need a sick day!
[577:36.92]Uh-oh.
[577:37.54]It's that black car again.
[577:39.52]Oh, these witches.
[577:42.72]Every car in the road.
[577:45.12]Every car in the road.
[577:46.20]They just try.
[577:47.04]They just try to get in your way.
[577:49.16]I'm still not even close.
[577:50.24]I gotta restart.
[577:51.45]I gotta go pee.
[578:07.45]There's no way I'm gonna make it.
[578:08.81]Because I don't even have the indicator of where the hell I need to go.
[578:11.95]I just finally got it.
[578:20.66]I feel like I'm playing Operation.
[578:22.82]With a cart.
[578:26.06]You gotta time limit in Operation.
[578:27.44]It's like, don't touch anything.
[578:29.66]Oh, now I have a wedgie.
[578:34.86]Eat my dust.
[578:37.08]Take King Homer if you dare!
[578:40.06]Take that!
[578:41.04]Oh, out of control!
[578:45.14]Another one?
[578:49.07]Like, look at all these fucking cars just everywhere.
[578:54.71]I fucking can't anymore, man.
[578:57.05]Why?
[579:04.25]Must.
[579:05.13]Never.
[579:05.88]There were two cars.
[579:07.06]Alright.
[579:07.90]Listen.
[579:09.36]There were two cars in the right side of the road.
[579:14.72]You understand?
[579:16.16]I had to str- How was I gonna- What's happening?
[579:34.51]Climb the building.
[579:52.69]A lot of money.
[579:56.14]Okay.
[579:57.50]Now what the hell do you want me to do?
[580:25.99]Do I have to keep climbing?
[580:39.48]This is probably the worst possible spot I could be in.
[580:55.56]One there.
[580:56.86]Come on.
[581:45.23]Instead of just double jumps forward.
[581:49.69]Should've just... put... No, I'm not gonna talk shit.
[581:54.11]Yeah, I am.
[582:01.45]Please put... Oh, he's gonna do it.
[582:03.25]He's gonna do it.
[582:05.22]He's gonna say it.
[582:05.76]Yeah, he is.
[582:08.26]Is he?
[582:08.52]I don't know.
[582:09.10]He might... I think he's gonna say it.
[582:10.92]Please put more 4 out of 10 platforming in a card game.
[582:15.35]I didn't mean to say that.
[582:45.10]I just- the camera is- I can't see the shadow!
[582:47.19]Alright, I'm not- I don't give a fuck!
[582:52.45]Get me up there!
[582:54.69]Like wha- uh, yeah!
[582:57.62]Great!
[582:57.90]Can I drive a fucking car now?
[583:00.30]What?
[583:22.28]This is- Drop.
[583:49.30]trap not trap I can't get him
[584:39.73]This one's safe.
[584:49.23]Safe.
[584:49.73]Right here.
[584:50.47]Okay.
[584:51.55]Number two on left is safe.
[584:53.31]What about number three on...
[584:56.43]Just talk to Mr. Burns!
[585:00.51]I'd love to do that.
[585:01.39]Okay, these two are safe.
[585:12.48]Jesus, okay.
[585:14.22]Oh my god!
[585:15.90]That duck at the top?
[585:17.38]Three?
[585:17.76]This is safe.
[585:21.74]This is safe.
[585:26.47]This is safe.
[585:41.96]He has to be safe.
[585:44.50]Oh, Odd Spudkins, is it you, Meriwether?
[585:47.32]Come to haunt me again?
[585:48.60]I killed you once.
[585:50.54]I... Mr. Burns, it's me, Homer Simpson.
[585:53.18]So you're not the ghost of my former partner?
[585:56.91]Well, that was... Well.
[585:59.99]Look, I need to get some barrels of radioactive waste to save Springfield from the aliens.
[586:04.48]I agree.
[586:04.86]Get it.
[586:05.56]Illegal aliens are a nuisance.
[586:07.22]Not leaf blower aliens.
[586:09.26]Tentacle aliens.
[586:11.02]Next game?
[586:11.98]Here's the map to where I buried nuclear waste barrels all over Springfield.
[586:16.91]Almost ten hours into this game.
[586:20.31]Next.
[586:22.05]Let's move on now.
[586:24.69]I got two missions left.
[586:27.71]Collect and deliver the nuclear waste to the spaceship.
[586:29.87]Don't let time run out.
[586:34.36]Now get into your vehicle.
[586:36.42]But these are all still activated.
[586:37.68]Are they still active?
[586:42.94]Actually, better that way.
[586:43.88]I should have just done it in the first place.
[586:48.23]Where's my car?
[587:06.28]This is the worst possible vehicle to do this.
[587:17.89]As you see, why?
[587:37.77]I could ju- no.
[587:38.67]I need another car.
[587:39.39]I need to get my car.
[587:40.15]It blew up!
[587:48.31]This thing sucks such ass.
[587:50.46]I'm sorry, lady.
[587:51.20]Good luck.
[587:52.82]Okay.
[588:11.78]Nice car.
[588:13.96]Finally I got a car out there.
[588:18.80]Just fall through!
[588:19.56]Fall through!
[588:21.10]The time stops.
[588:21.93]That's what a speedrunner does.
[588:22.79]The time doesn't keep ticking.
[588:31.53]Big bear?
[588:32.13]Why does everybody say big bear?
[588:34.55]I'm driving off without the juice.
[588:47.14]Okay, sit up.
[588:47.74]I'll be right back.
[588:51.27]I'm gonna get a drink.
[588:51.97]I'll be right back.
[591:27.25]Where are we?
[591:28.25]Restart, yeah.
[591:33.06]Piece of cake.
[591:38.00]I'm not drinking alcohol.
[591:42.30]You guys made me crash my game to prove it to you like six hours ago.
[591:46.25]I love to sit.
[591:52.96]I'm gonna try one of these tech.
[591:59.05]Ow!
[591:59.55]My neck!
[592:01.57]Just back out.
[592:07.51]It's crashing time!
[592:11.42]Let's roll.
[592:25.02]Ooh, the vibration's tickling my feet.
[592:34.53]Here we go.
[592:35.75]Get out of my way, jerkass!
[593:00.31]Okay, so far so good.
[593:02.63]You and the worst possible place you could be.
[593:09.40]Go in the... I didn't go in the fucking science fair.
[593:15.36]What is that place?
[593:16.20]A cemetery.
[593:17.16]I am Excellente.
[593:23.45]Can't you see I'm driving here?
[593:29.70]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[593:38.20]I wonder if I could just go right, right there, and maybe... 150.
[593:52.99]I could go right there too, but I can't.
[593:54.37]It just pops up on me too fast.
[593:58.09]The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.
[594:00.81]Eat my dust!
[594:01.63]What are you doing?
[594:05.49]What's happening right now?
[594:10.42]Get the lead out.
[594:12.60]Oh man, my car is gone.
[594:14.16]The ashtray was full of pennies.
[594:16.28]I need another car fast.
[594:22.93]Busted.
[594:23.09]I can't even get a hamburger anymore.
[594:25.63]It's so late right now, my god.
[594:27.03]I can't believe it.
[594:28.01]I was gonna get a triple cheeseburger.
[594:30.28]I'm gonna have to eat like Campbell's out of the can, cold.
[594:52.04]Yeah, I'm gonna have to get some Campbell's or some tuna.
[594:55.02]I'm gonna have to eat just cold, wet tuna.
[594:57.95]That's what I'm eating tonight.
[594:58.89]There's somebody on the car.
[595:31.22]Still on my tail?
[595:32.30]Really?
[595:32.92]How are you still on my tail?
[595:35.32]Get rid of this guy.
[595:37.20]Get away from me.
[595:39.04]How hard is it to lose an alien?
[595:40.58]Oh, come on.
[595:48.04]He spawned.
[595:49.30]That guy spawned.
[595:51.22]That motherfucker spawned.
[595:53.36]He's throwing me off.
[595:55.04]I got there.
[595:56.32]I'm good.
[596:26.54]Where is it?
[596:31.98]Why the timer?
[596:35.95]Did you just save the timer?
[596:40.29]What's going on?
[596:41.29]Get in the car!
[596:43.77]Wait.
[596:44.65]I have to do that again.
[596:56.56]No, I don't.
[596:57.24]Do I?
[597:02.34]I thought that I had... I go from that point.
[597:09.21]You don't go from that point, but I went from that point last time.
[597:16.75]Remember?
[597:17.93]You guys remember, right?
[597:23.26]Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.
[597:25.36]The car exploded.
[597:25.74]The car exploded the first time, too.
[597:28.95]You should be in Cannonball Run.
[597:30.91]Like, out of my way, walking dude.
[597:39.15]Hey, welcome to the new show.
[597:41.61]You people fucking driving into you.
[597:43.99]You shouldn't be there in the news.
[597:48.57]Like, there's a convention in town.
[597:52.42]This town is going to pay for this.
[597:55.60]Bloody generic villains.
[597:59.77]Just arrest me, please.
[598:05.38]Take all my money.
[598:06.32]I don't care.
[598:11.28]Just get over there, grab it, and then I have to go all the way back, but then if it explodes, then I have to do the whole thing again.
[598:17.39]I don't get a checkpoint halfway through.
[598:19.67]I have to do the whole thing over again.
[598:32.41]let me see alright in and out reverse reverse let's do this day I've really got to learn to enjoy my parole
[599:00.51]He's getting stringy.
[599:01.47]He's getting really stringy.
[599:02.67]And I missed the shortcut.
[599:06.07]Don't miss another shortcut and you're fine.
[599:15.52]Like this.
[599:16.00]Don't miss this shortcut.
[599:17.16]It's right here for you.
[599:29.20]Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.
[599:32.84]This town is going to pay for this.
[599:36.05]The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.
[599:38.95]I'm going to mess you up.
[599:45.03]A goddamn miracle that this thing hasn't missed.
[599:47.99]This town is going to pay for this.
[599:55.20]Oh.
[599:55.66]What?
[599:56.00]Um, I have... So, do I have to... I have to go all the way back.
[600:11.60]That's what's happening.
[600:12.38]So, this is just essentially... Why don't I just reset?
[600:14.82]Because it's doing the same thing again.
[600:31.16]What?
[600:32.00]Like, did they just, like, give the fuck up when they made the end of this game?
[600:36.09]Are you telling me that this is the third time Drive the juice from... Really?
[600:46.85]This is the climax of your whole entire game, and it's Drive back and forth from the goddamn power plant?
[600:58.20]They had a dinosaur four and a half hours ago.
[601:30.36]Hasta la Vista, suckers.
[601:37.32]Chicks love it when I do this.
[601:39.81]Tell me now.
[601:40.35]I need to know.
[601:41.77]Somebody tell me.
[601:43.13]Is the final mission of the game drive back and forth a bucket of sludge to the school?
[601:49.75]Tell me.
[601:51.95]Oh, yes it is.
[601:52.57]Okay.
[601:53.23]Wonderful.
[602:01.24]Fantastic.
[602:03.55]Ow!
[602:04.45]I got two shortcuts.
[602:06.97]Eat deer.
[602:07.59]This town is going to pay for this.
[602:09.33]Eat deer.
[602:10.43]Mistakes were made.
[602:12.35]I don't... What deer are you talking about?
[602:13.97]Oh, I know.
[602:20.52]Where did this go?
[602:21.34]Please, I still have it.
[602:26.94]You're not a very good driver.
[602:32.74]Everybody's in my way.
[602:35.08]Forever.
[602:35.54]Permanently.
[602:35.98]I'm almost there.
[602:39.95]It's just going too fast!
[602:48.37]Gonna be close.
[602:51.49]There's no red light here.
[602:53.43]You're in a cartoon land.
[602:54.49]There are no red lights.
[602:56.50]Why would you stop in the middle of the road?
[603:01.08]The goddamn Simpsons!
[603:02.18]There are no lights!
[603:03.16]I have to do this again, for another mission.
[603:31.67]They just copy and pasted the final three missions in the game.
[603:44.62]You know, I would be really upset about this, but it's a fucking Simpsons game.
[603:51.23]I'm shocked this game even functions.
[603:58.35]I'm not gonna make it.
[604:09.68]I'm gonna fail and end up right in front of it, aren't I?
[604:21.57]You're almost done?
[604:22.39]I know, I have to see this through.
[604:31.39]Where are they?
[604:33.77]What?
[604:34.49]Why are you facing the car this way, sir?
[604:38.59]Why did I face this way?
[604:39.39]Why wouldn't I go the other way?
[604:40.48]What?
[604:45.16]One side, Roadhog dude.
[604:55.51]Nothing lasts forever.
[605:03.01]Here's this dumbass again.
[605:08.31]Another variable that, like, Greg down the hall in fucking modeling decided to put in.
[605:22.67]Take that, Springfield.
[605:26.69]I'm going to mess you up.
[605:32.33]Why are you blaming Greg?
[605:34.73]He was the anchor that held this project together.
[605:36.81]This town is going to pay for this.
[605:46.86]Whoa, like there's a convention in town.
[605:51.74]One side, Roadhog Dude.
[606:02.01]I love how somebody just wrote, Jeremy, this joke has run its course for, it's been 10 hours.
[606:08.10]Imagine if this was just a big bit I was doing.
[606:12.22]I'm gonna beat the whole Simpsons hit and run on stream.
[606:18.12]That's just like, I'm just fucking around.
[606:21.14]I got ya!
[606:24.54]Every time I do that.
[606:25.52]I do it every time.
[606:27.38]Eat my dust!
[606:33.45]like out of my way walking dude we're starting to get to like melt my brain level here I just see the same image on my screen
[606:56.63]I haven't even seen more than probably four or five episodes of The Simpsons, but I feel like I've watched all of them.
[607:02.21]I know every... I know everything.
[607:04.61]I know every scenario.
[607:05.67]I know every joke.
[607:07.41]I'm certain I do.
[607:09.52]I can tell you them all.
[607:12.20]I'm gonna have a Simpsons dream.
[607:13.32]I'm gonna start making my pancakes in the shape of Homer's ass.
[607:19.68]Start talking like Marge.
[607:29.14]Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.
[607:31.95]I've really got to learn to enjoy my parole more often.
[607:36.37]We did it.
[607:36.69]That was so painful.
[607:45.12]Yeah, it was pretty painful.
[607:46.42]Now I have to do that again.
[607:47.16]Alright, last one.
[607:48.35]One more.
[607:48.79]One more.
[607:52.64]Where is it?
[608:23.01]What's happening?
[608:23.65]Where's my indicator?
[608:24.55]Where's my indicator?
[608:28.33]Did I not get one?
[608:36.27]I can't... I have to find my own way.
[608:43.86]Same place.
[608:46.00]Race the alien car.
[608:49.30]I can't... I am going to sneeze, but I can't mute it.
[608:53.80]Why do I have to race this car?
[608:55.96]The game is fucking crashing.
[608:59.42]I'm flying.
[609:00.22]I'm flying!
[609:00.76]No, I'm not.
[609:28.42]Make the scene!
[609:31.76]Move it!
[609:46.84]He's in!
[609:47.42]He's in!
[609:47.94]Eat deer!
[609:49.08]Eat deer!
[609:50.72]Eat deer!
[609:51.50]Eat deer!
[610:04.13]Oh, I just alt-tabbed.
[611:12.93]It's not going to move, and it'll hopefully come back.
[611:26.46]I just saw a thousand times join the Discord, and I was like, fine, I'm already frustrated, and I've alt-tabbed, and I pressed, and now I don't know when the last time the game was saved.
[611:56.21]What was the last level?
[612:02.85]What was the last one?
[612:06.73]Is there like some kind of magic I can do to bring this back?
[612:10.65]Does anybody have any ideas?
[612:12.78]Some weird PC fucking magic curse shit to bring this back.
[612:23.42]Cheat.
[612:24.40]Okay.
[612:25.56]Yeah, I'm going to cheat.
[612:26.40]I'm cheating.
[612:29.36]Oh, we're cheating.
[612:30.62]Absolutely.
[612:32.28]What's the cheat code to get to the last level?
[612:44.65]Thank you, CassAF, for the five community subs.
[612:55.15]You can try looking for a save file.
[612:58.73]I appreciate the help.
[612:59.77]This is my own fault, though.
[613:03.28]No, don't blame the people in the Discord.
[613:05.00]That's my fault.
[613:08.06]For alt-tabbing and forgetting that that happens.
[613:15.18]Alright, I'm going to cheat.
[613:20.68]But I know it doesn't... Okay.
[613:25.95]I'm just going to do it quick.
[613:28.59]I'm going to do it nice and quick.
[613:35.09]Look at this and how softly I'm speaking now.
[613:41.72]Okay.
[613:42.10]Hold on.
[613:44.50]I just need to do one more.
[614:14.07]This is like the third time I did this.
[614:17.20]What's wrong with me?
[614:18.98]I had so many opportunities to not do that.
[614:23.80]At least I heard people screaming in the Discord.
[614:26.92]Alright, here we go.
[614:28.96]I'm gonna punch in the thing.
[614:30.40]You know what?
[614:30.74]I talked a lot of shit about this game.
[614:34.30]It's this game from like 2003, so I can cheat and just get back to where I was.
[614:44.72]That's great.
[614:54.01]This is like an athlete taking drugs right before the finish line.
[614:58.15]No, it's... come on.
[615:00.43]Hopefully you can see it, though.
[615:01.37]I might have to re-pad it again.
[615:03.04]Now you got it.
[615:03.52]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[615:04.62]20th Century Fox.
[615:06.26]Alright, what buttons do I press?
[615:11.04]What's the combo?
[615:16.92]How do I do it?
[615:21.69]Simpsons hit and run.
[615:23.05]Up, down, left, right, A, B, A, B, start.
[615:25.49]What's wrong?
[615:29.19]Wait, can I just skip?
[615:39.11]I think I know, I can skip the missions I was gonna do, right?
[615:42.86]Holy shit, this is far away.
[615:54.08]Alright, so I'm just gonna fail and skip.
[616:02.45]Look at how long ago this was.
[616:03.59]Okay.
[616:11.89]Options.
[616:13.25]Somebody's got options.
[616:14.41]F1, right up, right up.
[616:17.95]Options.
[616:18.79]F1, right up, right up.
[616:30.05]What was it?
[616:30.57]That's not real.
[616:31.19]Okay, here we go.
[616:35.55]I'm gonna fuck up and I'm gonna change... here we go, lose.
[616:43.48]You can skip missions, but yeah, but I have to fail them first.
[616:46.80]What's the fastest way to fail a mission?
[616:54.54]Blow off the car.
[616:55.94]This is gonna take long.
[616:57.32]There's a cheat to unlock all the missions.
[616:59.12]Options F1, F2, F1, F2, up, down, up, down.
[617:00.42]Just get out of the car.
[617:29.12]Jesus.
[617:31.74]Google it?
[617:32.32]I can't Google it.
[617:35.02]I can't.
[617:36.78]Don't tell me to alt-tab and Google this shit.
[617:43.96]Phone?
[617:44.24]Oh, I have a telephone!
[618:00.48]Okay, Simpsons.
[618:01.62]I can't believe I'm doing this.
[618:04.79]Simpsons hit and run PC cheats.
[618:11.75]Alright, let's see.
[618:13.95]Retry mission.
[618:14.92]Sure.
[618:18.64]Cheat codes.
[618:20.98]By the way, I was not getting baited in the chat.
[618:23.22]That person was actually telling the truth.
[618:33.32]But that doesn't help me that much.
[618:34.36]It's just all characters, all vehicles.
[618:48.03]Different camera angles.
[618:50.41]Invincibility, higher acceleration.
[618:52.35]That's still gonna... Oh my god.
[619:00.40]Main menu options.
[619:01.94]Piece of cake!
[619:14.34]You know, the reason why I didn't save is because I think a bunch of- I looked over and people said that I had a corrupted save file.
[619:20.18]And I just didn't save and I was so...
[619:45.93]Pick and choose what to believe.
[619:47.33]Alright, what am I trying?
[619:48.55]Oh, man.
[619:49.23]I feel so defeated.
[619:50.51]I was at the end of the game.
[619:51.35]God damn it.
[619:54.39]I should have just stared at the screen.
[620:03.36]So, I guess... I still... So, let's see here.
[620:10.06]Load game, scrapbook, options, bonus game.
[620:14.81]I'm on PC.
[620:18.09]If you fail a mission five times, it lets you skip, but I have to fail, like, five missions five times.
[620:37.90]Just reset the mission.
[620:39.20]Can I just reset the mission five?
[620:41.00]Does that count?
[620:42.18]I guess it does, right?
[620:47.15]See what happens if I do that.
[620:48.15]Download a save?
[621:02.48]I'm kind of afraid to do that.
[621:09.09]For one reason.
[621:10.27]Because I feel like this is like a... To get the game to even run, there's mods and shit to get the game to work.
[621:15.31]I feel like I could fuck up a lot of shit, maybe.
[621:17.29]Alright, here we go.
[621:22.58]Let's see if this counts.
[621:29.32]Sweet!
[621:30.98]I'm a...
[621:39.83]It doesn't count.
[621:52.94]You must fail it, not restart it.
[621:59.98]I was right there.
[622:01.34]Why did I not save it?
[622:02.78]I don't know why.
[622:03.69]I'm just- my brain is so fried.
[622:05.31]I don't know how to co- people saying corrupt save, don't save.
[622:10.77]Why are you continuing to throw rocks at my house?
[622:15.17]I thought we were over that!
[622:31.47]I feel so unfulfilled though.
[622:33.21]I'm so unfulfilled!
[622:35.66]What's the fastest way to lose?
[622:37.28]Drive into the ocean?
[622:38.26]Just drive to the- just like go to the power plant, I guess.
[623:02.79]The start of this mission has a 20 second timer.
[623:07.37]Just exit the car at the beginning of the mission.
[623:09.31]Oh, I forgot my mission!
[623:15.08]It might be faster to just beat the missions.
[623:23.90]I was dumb.
[623:25.86]It was so close.
[623:27.62]Oh.
[623:30.73]Just wait the 20 seconds?
[623:36.13]Am I- I'm not emulating the game.
[623:53.55]This is the PC version.
[624:06.09]I can't just, like, fuck it up?
[624:12.25]Destroy the car.
[624:14.31]I wonder what the fastest way to do that is.
[624:20.94]Maybe the actual mod that I have can... I can use it, maybe.
[624:32.54]I love how we're trying to figure out ways to make this go back to normal.
[624:37.39]Just watch the ending on YouTube.
[624:43.60]Alright, hold on here.
[624:44.94]I think I got away.
[624:51.48]Kill code might save us here.
[624:52.82]Let's see.
[624:57.33]Kill code, you gonna save us?
[624:58.39]Let's find out.
[625:06.67]The all mission cheat is in the mod manager.
[625:09.37]Yes!
[625:13.99]Who cares?
[625:14.73]It's under unlock all missions.
[625:32.93]Oh, would you just love it.
[625:35.67]There it is.
[625:36.76]It's done.
[625:37.98]All missions have been unlocked.
[625:40.08]Let's go.
[625:40.46]I thought you were gonna debate me in the alt tab and Discord, huh?
[626:03.15]How do I do this?
[626:10.78]So how do I select a mission?
[626:17.00]Let's do new game?
[626:24.03]Yeah, I can still see you.
[626:27.17]Load game.
[626:30.29]Or just resume.
[626:33.36]New game plus.
[626:35.46]Resume game.
[626:41.69]Okay.
[626:55.05]Let's go!
[626:55.55]Let's go.
[626:57.59]Let's go.
[626:58.97]Let's do it.
[627:01.05]I'm ready.
[627:02.18]Let's go.
[627:04.98]Let's do it.
[627:05.50]Come on.
[627:06.08]First fucking try.
[627:06.96]Check this out.
[627:07.80]Three, two, one.
[627:09.20]Hot diggity!
[627:16.81]Why did I come here again?
[627:18.19]Homer hates losing!
[627:22.75]Homer smash!
[627:33.62]He used a cheat code!
[627:40.85]And people say I'm slow.
[627:43.25]Wait a minute, that was an insult!
[627:46.25]It was like that when I got here.
[627:52.17]Damn it, I dropped my kebab.
[627:54.72]Please don't tell anybody I did this!
[627:57.26]That hurts.
[628:04.23]There it is.
[628:05.01]You dick!
[628:05.27]Get off the wheels!
[628:06.49]Oh my god, it was there!
[628:31.72]I'm not gonna make it and I'm aahhhhh. Ugggghhh. Hrhmmm.
[628:45.72]Hohoho, I can't go through the barn. It's too much. It's been 11 hours.
[628:55.72]I can't focus!
[629:03.25]It's gonna take me like a week to recover from this stream.
[629:12.72]I may have even shit my pants and I don't even know.
[629:17.46]It's possible.
[629:18.04]Look at him trying, look at him just ruining everything.
[629:25.69]Look at him fucking ruining everything.
[629:28.21]Just flipping cars over.
[629:29.93]Good thing you're stupid.
[629:33.39]Clear it.
[629:34.91]Okay, done.
[629:35.43]Shoma, shut up please!
[629:59.06]I'm gonna turn off the voice.
[630:00.28]I don't wanna hear talking about his feet.
[630:04.22]I used to say it a fucking thousand times.
[630:06.96]A fucking thousand times.
[630:11.30]I don't care about Homer's feet anymore.
[630:15.11]I'm here.
[630:15.49]I'm here.
[630:15.81]Just drive anyway.
[630:25.39]This is the only time that I have to get back?
[630:29.93]No way!
[630:30.73]That's less than a minute!
[630:35.27]Oh, I'm going to a better place!
[631:11.07]I need a wrench.
[631:12.59]Right now.
[631:18.34]Is there a wrench here?
[631:23.84]There's no wrench.
[631:24.56]I'm in so much trouble.
[631:35.85]Yeah, Ghost is going to work at the power plant.
[631:43.57]On your brainless AI path!
[631:47.82]No, there's no way this ain't happening.
[632:18.74]You gotta hit everything.
[632:21.36]Perfect.
[632:22.50]Even this is a pain in the ass.
[632:24.28]You gotta beat him there, and then... What kind of drugs were these kids taking back here to beat this?
[632:33.17]What?!
[632:38.55]I don't understand!
[632:57.99]The random AI drivers are infuriating.
[633:06.31]They just sometimes are in the worst possible spot.
[633:21.34]He just squished me and it saved my life.
[633:25.39]How am I gonna focus to be able to do this?
[633:28.91]On the way back, it's volcano.
[633:31.17]And then, I'm squinting right now.
[633:33.29]Cemetery, volcano.
[633:39.32]I got double dunked.
[633:43.94]Out of the fucking way.
[633:45.04]Get, please.
[633:46.51]And I'm already smoking.
[634:09.99]fucking witch the witch I just I gotta go this way oh my god
[634:47.80]Everybody's a witch.
[634:48.48]I didn't even sit down.
[634:49.76]Okay, come on.
[634:58.91]All I imagine, the only way this is possible to beat this is on the first or second try ever.
[635:04.14]I mean, we're talking... We fucking did it.
[635:08.54]We did it together.
[635:09.76]We're in this together, alien.
[635:13.91]Good, I'm glad I'm killing this witch.
[635:16.89]I hope I broke every bone in that witch's body.
[635:19.93]Wow, slow down!
[635:21.35]Easy!
[635:25.64]Unnecessary!
[635:34.06]He's right next to me.
[635:35.10]We're both gonna do the same thing.
[635:36.12]He's gonna hit me.
[635:38.02]I can hear him.
[635:38.54]He's right behind me.
[635:40.46]I think he crashed.
[635:41.66]Yeah, that dude crashed.
[635:46.77]Thank you.
[635:47.41]Drive into me, please.
[635:57.19]Does anybody else feel like they're flying through space right now?
[636:00.49]Fucking get out of my way!
[636:04.35]I'm in like a time warp.
[636:05.83]So many pumpkin cars.
[636:24.35]Okay.
[636:28.79]No witch.
[636:31.14]If there's a witch, I'll puke.
[636:32.04]There's a witch.
[636:32.71]Get out of the way, you fucking stupid!
[636:36.61]I still am okay.
[636:37.81]I'm okay.
[636:43.85]No!
[636:46.97]We're docking.
[636:47.99]We're docking.
[636:51.91]Same spot.
[636:54.24]It's possible still.
[636:58.24]No, it's not!
[637:19.13]A glimpse of which, again, it was the witch's fault.
[637:20.87]Again.
[637:47.61]So, somebody give $100.
[637:51.22]Thank you for the $100.
[637:53.54]Yes is online.
[637:59.48]Thank you.
[638:00.54]The Discord apologizes for their actions.
[638:02.59]We were just having fun and didn't mean to ruin the stream.
[638:16.48]Uh, you didn't ruin the stream.
[638:20.24]Thank you so much for $100.
[638:21.16]As long as you have, it don't matter.
[638:23.94]If you're having fun, I'm happy.
[638:25.14]Who cares?
[638:26.98]Did the game get louder?
[638:30.58]Am I hearing things?
[638:32.12]Did the game get louder?
[638:34.18]I think the game got louder.
[638:37.80]Just for a second there.
[638:39.82]Hey, roll yourself off a cliff.
[638:42.36]Dickhead, get out of my way.
[638:53.98]See, he's having trouble with the robot people too.
[638:56.56]And the witches.
[638:57.14]I don't even know what he did.
[639:02.67]He just crashed, I think.
[639:16.21]I cleared it.
[639:22.32]The game's getting louder!
[639:23.92]Is this just me?
[639:32.40]The music!
[639:34.85]I'm about to go into another plane.
[639:38.81]I feel like the rapture is happening right now, and I'm going up.
[639:50.68]Okay.
[639:53.73]Is there a wrench?
[640:00.45]What's this wrench?
[640:00.99]Is there a wrench in here?
[640:07.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[640:09.12]Reverse in!
[640:09.72]That's a great idea!
[640:10.66]Fuck!
[640:32.51]Oh, why did you do that?
[640:35.01]I hit it perfect.
[640:47.73]These fucking idiots on this absurd, nearly impossible part of the game.
[640:54.99]You have to have these guys like all over the fucking road.
[641:08.46]Do I want anything from McDonald's?
[641:10.24]Yeah, two Big Macs!
[641:12.30]Two Big Macs, two large fries, and a large shake!
[641:17.40]And I want it, I want it!
[641:33.31]I want it now!
[641:34.27]I don't even know where I'm driving.
[641:42.80]Please and thank you.
[641:44.87]Thank you.
[642:09.56]It's not the route.
[642:10.94]It's not the shortcuts.
[642:12.52]It's the random dickheads that just drive around and make it impossible.
[642:18.16]The one guy in the boat that just gets in the way.
[642:20.82]Because you have a minute to drive across the game.
[642:24.36]And this guy just rows out in front of you in the middle of the fucking lake.
[642:42.89]Unmute the voices for the finale?
[642:45.69]Maybe.
[642:51.39]As the fish out there, you kill the same guy every time.
[642:55.97]You have no remorse for that?
[642:57.68]Do you feel nothing with that?
[643:03.00]Muktari is fishing with my friend!
[643:12.55]Hey, I eat shit.
[643:14.65]I don't know what just happened to my car, but it just, like, fucking goes... I'll get it.
[643:31.70]Somebody said there's a really big shortcut I'm missing.
[643:35.19]Is there... The graveyard is the one I keep jumping into the fucking wall.
[643:42.15]I'm going too fast.
[643:44.19]Turn on the facecam, I don't have any clothes on.
[643:48.04]I gotta stop breathing.
[643:54.62]God, I'm going the wrong way again.
[644:12.11]I think something happened, yeah.
[644:15.15]Alright, let's try it again.
[644:16.03]Alright, somebody had a great idea.
[644:43.23]Punch it!
[644:57.20]It's throwing me off.
[644:58.06]It threw me off.
[644:58.82]Have you seen the Jim Carrey movie where he deletes his memory of shit?
[645:11.54]Eternal Sunshine don't want to remember my girlfriend, whatever the fucking name of the thing is.
[645:20.75]I wonder if it exists for... You know.
[645:55.53]I can't go to bed.
[645:56.43]I have to beat this.
[645:57.75]I can't.
[645:58.77]You think I'll ever live that down?
[646:00.87]I'm not gonna be the guy that almost beat Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[646:07.20]I'm not gonna be the guy that got to the end of Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[646:11.72]I wanna be the guy that beat Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[646:24.08]Is this the last mission?
[646:25.04]This is it.
[646:25.74]This is all that matters.
[646:26.86]Is this.
[646:33.39]I have an idea.
[646:35.45]Call me crazy on this one.
[646:36.43]Go ahead.
[646:37.31]I got a great idea.
[646:38.39]Trust me.
[646:50.80]Too many distractions.
[646:51.60]Too many loud sounds.
[646:52.68]Too many fucking screaming.
[646:56.47]Here we go.
[648:58.02]second alien car second alien second alien car I didn't why is there another second alien car
[649:30.58]How is he in front of me?
[650:09.37]What a weird stream this has become.
[650:18.21]I'll try it again.
[650:23.99]He just exploded.
[650:32.09]I need that wrench so bad.
[650:33.67]I don't care.
[650:39.93]The wrench is over here.
[650:40.86]It's worth it.
[652:11.80]I hit one guy and all of a sudden the police are here.
[652:19.53]The police shouldn't be here.
[652:20.57]I ran over one guy.
[652:31.58]Idiot.
[652:35.58]Police, police, come on.
[652:38.88]Oh my god.
[652:40.96]Oh my god.
[652:42.81]Oh my god.
[652:47.57]No.
[652:48.25]No.
[652:48.98]No.
[652:53.66]No.
[652:59.60]No.
[653:01.90]No.
[653:03.68]No.
[653:05.24]Don't get into me.
[653:52.42]I was... I was... I win.
[653:54.80]I got in the... I got in the beam.
[653:58.34]And then I got arrested in the beam.
[654:02.48]I got arrested inside the beam.
[654:05.92]And it put me out.
[654:06.64]I didn't really know where I was.
[654:07.92]And then one time I figured it out.
[654:14.91]Grandpa, I don't know what to say about that one.
[654:20.95]I can't believe it.
[654:22.55]It was there.
[654:24.03]It was over.
[654:29.92]I got impressed in the beam.
[654:36.22]I need to have no sounds though.
[654:37.70]No sounds really does help.
[654:51.57]If you did it once, you can do it again.
[654:52.81]That's true.
[654:53.75]And I can do it even cleaner this time.
[654:55.35]I'm on life support right now.
[655:12.76]I think this is the first time I've ever had a stream longer than 11 hours.
[655:16.89]It has to be.
[655:27.39]Simpsons fucking hit and run.
[655:30.45]I'm gonna get a tattoo of this game.
[655:32.25]Up my ass.
[655:32.87]On my ass.
[655:44.60]Hey, how's the boat?
[655:45.94]How's the boat?
[655:46.98]Where's the skipper?
[655:51.61]I'm still gonna beat him.
[656:09.52]This is what it sounds like in here, guys.
[656:11.64]This is what my room sounds like.
[656:12.68]It's just quiet.
[656:21.08]Sometimes your car has passed by.
[656:22.70]Okay.
[656:25.51]I know that there's two dickheads over there on the left.
[656:30.39]Here we go.
[656:31.35]I did it once before I could... I...
[656:49.53]What are the cops doing here?
[657:12.96]I didn't... What did I do wrong at the end there?
[657:16.94]There's a wrench right here.
[657:17.76]I'll get it.
[657:23.84]okay everybody relax I got 30 seconds to get in there and spin around if I oh man alright no cops better good
[659:34.63]the end of the episode.
[659:35.51]Oh, I did it.
[659:38.06]I beat it.
[659:38.54]I beat the, I beat it.
[659:39.56]I did it.
[659:40.32]Yes.
[659:41.00]It's over.
[659:41.83]Bye.
[659:42.77]I win.
[659:43.59]I win the game.
[660:03.91]I'm not alt-tabbing.
[660:05.43]I can't even react to winning.
[660:06.51]Stop the graphics.
[660:07.47]Can't hear the cutscene.
[660:08.25]Do it again.
[660:09.31]Sorry, you can YouTube it.
[660:34.94]He sounds manic.
[660:36.20]I mean, I probably am.
[661:11.13]Hooray.
[661:11.35]Well, that was a game.
[661:12.19]That was wild.
[661:12.75]Simpsons hit and run.
[661:36.50]Srolliot.
[661:38.02]Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[661:39.10]20 from Srolliot.
[662:00.30]Next Simpsons game.
[662:01.56]No.
[662:01.62]Okay, I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[662:04.54]I did not think for a second.
[662:07.50]Everyone was like, I'll play Simpsons Hit and Run.
[662:09.84]It's funny Mark Simpson.
[662:11.80]And you drive around and you pick up stuff.
[662:13.82]I didn't think this was going to be a hard game.
[662:30.09]First impressions?
[662:30.81]I wouldn't wish what I just did on my worst enemy.
[662:32.63]Fun game though.
[663:02.40]Is it worse or easier than Dark Souls?
[663:09.34]I can't make that comparison, it's a Simpsons racing game.
[663:14.68]It's so easy, what?
[663:19.33]The first six hours, the first like five or six hours of this game was fine.
[663:25.09]And then they just came out with a few missions that were just like, hey, uh, good luck.
[663:34.35]I beat this when I was 8.
[663:42.49]Why am I up at 3am?
[663:43.62]Yeah, I was planning on streaming in like... 11 hours or something.
[663:48.16]What time is it?
[663:48.68]2.30?
[663:50.78]3.30?
[663:50.80]4.30?
[663:50.90]I don't know if there's gonna be a stream tomorrow.
[664:02.00]We might have to push tomorrow's stream to Monday.
[664:15.69]It is Monday.
[664:16.57]Today is Monday.
[664:17.35]What is today?
[664:19.88]Is it Monday?
[664:20.48]I mean Tuesday.
[664:22.18]Because I'm probably not going to get to bed until about 4 or 5.
[664:34.51]That means you gotta play today.
[664:48.24]This doesn't count, guys.
[664:50.80]No, no, no, no.
[664:51.64]This is not a 16%.
[664:52.70]Remember, I had to skip.
[664:55.40]I had to time travel because of the alt-tab bullshit.
[665:00.36]See the story missions and the bonus missions.
[665:02.24]I did all this already.
[665:10.22]Well, there's a lot of people here.
[665:11.48]I did not expect this many people to stay up for this.
[665:13.82]I know we got raided, uh, I think a couple times.
[665:17.54]If you still stuck around from those raids, thank you.
[665:20.59]Welcome.
[665:20.95]Hope you had a good time.
[665:24.45]I know Nova came in with a raid, so to all of you that came over from there, much love to you.
[665:30.75]Thanks for sticking around.
[665:33.60]And wherever you came from, thanks for watching.
[665:40.48]This turned into an EU stream.
[665:42.40]Yes, it did.
[665:44.58]Two, three, four, five.
[665:45.52]It's almost six.
[665:46.78]Is it almost 6 a.m.?
[665:48.12]It's 5.30 a.m.
[665:48.56]Eastern.
[665:51.20]Wow.
[665:54.93]Well, I will see you guys.
[665:57.35]I'm going to go over the bits.
[665:58.05]We're still going to do the bits, but I'm going to go through them faster, and I'm not going to read every message.
[666:02.29]Sorry, but it's very late.
[666:13.32]But if you're taking off, I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[666:16.60]And let's go ahead and put the end screen on so people know it's really open.
[666:28.21]Take care, guys.
[666:28.67]See you soon.
[666:31.79]I fell asleep while you were streaming and I'm getting ready for work now.
[666:35.47]Yeah.
[666:35.83]I mean, seriously.
[666:37.57]I...
[666:39.21]There are people that do 10, 12 hour streams all the time.
[666:42.57]10 plus hour streams.
[666:47.15]Man.
[666:48.51]That's tough.
[666:51.49]That is tough shit, man.
[666:52.63]It really is.
[666:55.21]But... More respect and power to him, right?
[667:03.92]But that's where I'm gonna end it.
[667:05.42]See you Tuesday.
[667:05.86]If you've taken off, we're gonna go to the bits, and we'll do the subs as well.
[667:08.98]In the form of the credits.
[667:10.83]So I gotta go back a while ago.
[667:18.55]Glad I stayed up.
[667:19.47]Been busy doing stuff tonight on the computer.
[667:21.77]Well, thanks for coming out.
[667:25.67]I had a lot of fun.
[667:30.60]Beat a game every stream.
[667:32.20]I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[667:39.67]It's time for slime.
[667:40.31]Thanks for the $5.
[667:42.39]We hit some roadblocks, but in the end we persevered.
[667:45.25]We tried.
[667:45.99]Smacklesmore, thanks for the $1.
[667:47.33]Thanks for saving the stream with your epic computer and gamer skills.
[667:49.89]In Jex we trust.
[667:54.36]Thank you.
[667:57.34]Alec, thank you for the $1.
[667:58.48]Alec, come on down to Jerma's stream where we talk about Dr. Phil and Adam Sandler while playing Simpsons Hit and Run.
[668:09.18]Today we did do that.
[668:12.51]Uh, thank you Shiggy for the $1.
[668:13.89]Watching you play this game brings back so many memories of never playing it and just watching my older brother play it when I was little.
[668:21.87]It's an old game.
[668:25.27]More than a decade old.
[668:26.11]I mean, I talked a lot of shit and I complained, but remember, 95% of the things I say are just horseshit.
[668:36.43]And it's me opening up my shirt and... cartoon Bugs Bunny steam coming up.
[668:43.41]I wasn't even alive a decade ago, what?
[669:00.36]But thank you too, Shiggy.
[669:01.66]Thank you to Demonic Cucumber for the $1, adding to the point I made earlier about you needing to spend more time to explore the levels and maps.
[669:07.68]Not only are you missing out on really cool secrets and puzzles, but you aren't exploring the map, so you have no idea what shortcuts or routes to take in missions you need to explore.
[669:14.85]Oh, I stopped halfway through there and really wanted to look around for a little bit. ...
[669:33.83]I stopped caring.
[669:35.83]Well, okay, the last two chapters, I would probably agree with you.
[669:44.77]That's true.
[669:46.21]Because it was getting late, and it was getting hard and frustrating, and I really just wanted to do it and try to get it done.
[669:57.76]But thanks for the tips.
[670:03.30]Rotten Fresh, again, $50.
[670:04.86]Lightning Rider, $50.
[670:07.56]Huge money.
[670:08.08]Thanks, both of you.
[670:10.85]I really appreciate it.
[670:15.73]We stopped and talked about them, but again, it's a lot of money.
[670:20.83]Uh, eufronio live, thanks for the one dollar.
[670:24.49]Can you please play Big Chung... I don't want to say that, I don't know what it is.
[670:29.59]Chat's gonna love it.
[670:30.47]Is it... Okay, what is this big C-H-U-N thing?
[670:33.95]G... Is this a bad thing to say?
[670:36.41]Is it... Is it bad?
[670:50.70]It's Bugs Bunny.
[670:53.08]The Bugs Bunny is fat.
[670:54.18]I get it.
[670:55.52]What?
[671:00.29]Fat Bugs Bunny.
[671:04.55]Oh, well, I don't know what that is.
[671:07.31]Thank you, Carlos, the clan, for the one dollar.
[671:09.65]They just say Jupiter.
[671:11.15]Thank you.
[671:12.73]Speaking of that, I want to make sure I say it again for those of you that were not here yesterday.
[671:17.64]Shirts are actually, I can tell you that for real, they're coming.
[671:21.56]At some point before January is over.
[671:24.44]So there'll be a new shirt, and I'm going to bring back the Gloom Man shirt for potentially permanent.
[671:34.31]And I hear a dog barking.
[671:40.38]So, that's going to happen probably in the next couple weeks.
[671:43.06]I'm going to say at some point, probably within the next two weeks.
[671:47.36]I'm going to try.
[671:48.13]But it will be here.
[671:48.91]It will be here.
[671:52.07]Thank you, Alec, for the $2.
[671:53.85]What's your opinion on cheddar Jack cheese?
[671:56.63]It's... Well, those are good.
[672:00.59]Cheddar Jack cheeses are really good.
[672:08.20]They're delicious.
[672:10.18]I like extra toasty Cheez-Its or the Tabasco Cheez-Its.
[672:12.88]They'd be great.
[672:13.38]That's my recommendation.
[672:18.10]Dark Soul, thanks for the $1.
[672:18.92]Hey, Jerma, I'm the one who made the Fire Marriott shirt donation last night.
[672:22.80]Just wanted to add that I love you and your streams.
[672:26.00]Because of you, I found a new appreciation in Twitch.
[672:28.49]Never liked Twitch or streams in general, but watching you and the amazing memes and chat makes me want to watch you every day.
[672:34.73]Keep what you're doing, because it makes a small part of my life so much more enjoyable.
[672:40.23]Yeah, hell yeah.
[672:40.79]Thank you.
[672:46.07]I'm just happy that you guys still think it's fun to be here.
[672:50.07]Sometimes I wonder, you know?
[672:50.97]Sometimes I think about, eh, people still having fun.
[672:54.47]Is this fun?
[672:55.45]People having fun.
[672:58.45]And I want to make sure that's still happening, you know?
[673:05.99]I do think about that all the time, so thank you.
[673:10.18]sly pickle thanks for the two bucks hey Jerma not trying to get too serious but I came out to my parents today and the stream has been helping me since then love you man hell yeah much love to you thank you so much for the two dollars
[673:49.86]That was Sly Pickle.
[673:54.12]Good luck.
[673:54.58]Take care.
[673:54.96]Thank you so much.
[674:03.38]We got Rytanic for a dollar.
[674:05.06]Was that a Marge Simpson impression or a Toad from Super Mario?
[674:10.98]That went in the same.
[674:14.33]All you need to do is just pitch shift Toad down by 5% and you got Marge.
[674:21.45]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[674:22.36]Uh, Sottletees for Jerma Rumble 2019.
[674:24.92]This was so long ago, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[674:32.24]How ridiculous is that?
[674:34.24]Was it like 11 and a half hours ago or something?
[674:36.13]How long ago is that?
[674:39.49]I think I said something, maybe.
[674:43.63]But, thank you.
[674:46.09]I don't remember either.
[674:48.40]You're the one.
[674:49.96]That's, I love that.
[674:52.85]That's amazing.
[674:55.29]Rytanic, thanks for the $1.
[674:56.21]Footfungus, thanks for the $1.
[674:58.71]Check your ass.
[675:00.17]Okay.
[675:01.21]Seems alright.
[675:02.61]DoubleD, thanks for the $1.
[675:03.73]We did it, guys.
[675:04.25]We bullied Jerma into making weird noises again.
[675:06.53]Why do you want a bullet?
[675:21.52]I muted myself, which is, that's what happened.
[675:24.06]I said, we just put that on the rocks, okay?
[675:28.51]You don't need to throw rocks at me.
[675:34.71]Radiotrophic, thanks for the $5.
[675:36.19]They say never, never buy a keyboard off of, why is it so small?
[675:50.75]My eyes can't even read this.
[675:53.55]Largest gnome in the world.
[675:55.61]Where's the link for this?
[675:56.49]Do you really want me to give you the link of a gnome in the chat?
[676:03.01]Do you really want me to do that?
[676:03.91]Someone's going to not even be paying attention and click that.
[676:05.67]And they're going to be like, what the fuck?
[676:10.25]Oh, it's a tiny text meme joke.
[676:11.65]Alright.
[676:13.23]Alright, thank you for the $5.
[676:15.71]Appreciate it, Radiotropic.
[676:23.26]John Horns, thanks for the three bucks.
[676:25.02]Hey, Jerma, just graduated from college.
[676:26.28]Just want to see how much you managed to brighten up certain days by putting me in physical pain from laughing.
[676:30.70]So happy to see you prosper in Vegas.
[676:32.84]Can't wait to see what kind of crazy shit you pull next.
[676:36.69]Hook'em Horns.
[676:37.79]Hook'em Horns.
[676:39.49]Chairman Hart.
[676:40.23]Thank you, John Horns.
[676:41.77]Or Jorn Horns.
[676:43.97]I'm calling you John.
[676:44.71]Hey, John.
[676:50.82]Thank you.
[676:52.97]I'm having a blast, and I'm trying to, uh, trying to get some stuff going, you know?
[676:57.93]Jeremy, you gotta go through the boat.
[677:00.73]Teleporting me back.
[677:04.25]Uh, Jobo, thanks for the ten bucks.
[677:05.61]I just want to say thanks for giving me the deepest belly laughs I've ever experienced.
[677:09.69]I gotta thank you for ten dollars.
[677:11.37]And thank you for watching my stream.
[677:17.56]It means a lot.
[677:19.80]Glad you're enjoying yourself.
[677:22.85]Elizabeth, thanks for the one dollar.
[677:24.13]They say, uh, they say poo-poo pee-pee.
[677:27.64]Thank you.
[677:28.48]Uh, Jerma is the best.
[677:29.44]Thanks for one dollar.
[677:34.78]I'm remembering a monolog for the August Wilson monolog competition.
[677:40.63]And you are one of the people that motivated me to do it.
[677:44.35]You also influenced my love for theater, believe it or not.
[677:46.53]Speaking of theater, are you ever going to rent out a whole theater for a joke?
[677:51.01]Uh, yes.
[677:53.05]Yes.
[677:55.91]That is something I want to do.
[677:57.43]I have a plan.
[678:06.24]Maybe not soon, but this year.
[678:08.14]I have a couple of plans, but yeah, that would be fun.
[678:15.57]And then Fitty gave the $100.
[678:16.39]There was like $200 or $300 that jumped up.
[678:21.15]Bang, bang, bang, over the course of a couple hours.
[678:24.03]Thank you, Fitty.
[678:25.81]Thank you, FGWGWF, for the $1, $2.
[678:31.26]Keep your fucking eyes on the road, man.
[678:33.56]And then, hey, Jeremy, you're great and super tall.
[678:35.60]Managed to catch every stream so far this week, which is rare with my work schedule.
[678:39.72]But every one of them has been great.
[678:40.72]Thanks for being the best.
[678:45.36]Thank you.
[678:48.80]Appreciate it.
[678:49.70]F-G-W-G-W-F.
[678:54.36]Diecord, thanks for the $4.
[678:55.34]Oh boy, a Jerma stream that I can watch and it's not in the middle of the night.
[678:59.53]It's probably because it was in the morning.
[679:03.45]Head into bed.
[679:05.25]Have a great night.
[679:07.55]Thank you, Diecord.
[679:09.71]Frisky McFrisky, thanks for the $5.
[679:10.94]Eat bits.
[679:11.78]Eat bits.
[679:12.58]Bit eats.
[679:16.45]Thank you for the $5.
[679:19.83]FGWGWF came in again with another dollar.
[679:24.26]It's a YouTube link.
[679:25.84]What is this?
[679:32.90]It says this reminds me of a fetch mission.
[679:42.21]Goldeneye?
[679:45.68]What a rush!
[679:48.37]Streets Agent 112.
[679:49.65]Right in the fucking head!
[680:14.16]That was loud.
[680:16.09]Show us!
[680:20.03]This is the video here.
[680:25.89]Reminds me of the fetch mission.
[680:28.81]112 Streets Agent.
[680:30.31]It's pretty nice.
[680:31.19]It's a speedrun.
[680:34.21]It's a legendary speedrun meme.
[680:36.77]Nice.
[680:39.87]Alphity came in with another $6 on top of the $100.
[680:44.03]I mean, I said that I wouldn't donate again, but getting the top donator spot two weeks in a row was too tempting.
[680:53.65]You spoil me.
[680:54.51]You're spoiling me too much, Fitty.
[680:57.72]Thank you.
[681:01.76]Z Stink Loser, thanks for the $1 hot dog.
[681:07.65]50 for $1.
[681:08.49]Hey man, we really do live in the future, don't we?
[681:10.85]I didn't want to miss a second of the stream, but I also really needed to pee loudly.
[681:14.84]So I just took my phone to the bathroom and I'm watching it on the toilet.
[681:17.42]This is great.
[681:28.86]Hey, Dragonthorne, thanks for the five dollars.
[681:31.18]No message, just cheer.
[681:32.72]Five hundred, thank you.
[681:34.58]No, there actually, there is more.
[681:35.78]Thanks for the fifteen total dollars here, Dragonthorne.
[681:41.21]Uh... I fought in the Great War, settled down with my wife, had three kids, and died at the ripe age of 85 since I last checked in on you streaming this game.
[681:55.29]Thanks for the $15, Dragothorn.
[681:58.25]And thanks for the $1.
[682:01.19]Thank you so much for $15, for real.
[682:03.27]And the cap, David, thanks for the $1.
[682:06.49]It says, eat deer.
[682:08.39]And there's a billboard that says somebody eating deer on it.
[682:12.90]That's what you guys have been saying, okay.
[682:19.96]Not much more, getting close to the end.
[682:23.32]Thank you, Holly, or Holly-oo, or Holly-oo, for the $15.
[682:27.53]Sorry about the crash.
[682:29.07]Thank God for cheating.
[682:30.51]Also, will you ever play Chrono Trigger?
[682:32.17]You seem to love it so much.
[682:33.23]Why not stream it?
[682:37.11]No, don't worry about that.
[682:38.07]I was just fucking around.
[682:42.10]I was just messing around.
[682:42.74]Don't worry, guys.
[682:46.74]Chrono Trigger on stream?
[682:47.90]I don't think so.
[682:52.08]We've had this conversation about it a couple times.
[682:55.88]It... I don't like to stream games that I've already done.
[683:00.06]Multiple times.
[683:01.86]Because then it's just kind of me showing you guys stuff.
[683:05.64]Oh, hey, look!
[683:06.72]I know what this is.
[683:08.18]I remember this part.
[683:09.30]Wow, this part's cool.
[683:10.74]You're like that guy at the movie theater that's like, hey, look at this, this is the best part!
[683:13.48]And it's like, alright, thanks.
[683:14.98]Oh, this is my favorite part, my favorite weapon in the game.
[683:17.54]Okay.
[683:18.10]Okay.
[683:20.54]Shay!
[683:20.84]Look at this part!
[683:21.80]Okay.
[683:22.28]Cool.
[683:22.58]Thanks.
[683:22.92]You know, I'm watching the movie right now.
[683:25.20]I don't want to be that guy.
[683:28.26]So, I don't really typically stream games that I've already played.
[683:31.39]A lot.
[683:32.29]Bloodborne comes to mind.
[683:34.33]I've gone through that game like five times, maybe more, at this point.
[683:39.85]Chrono Trigger...
[683:50.17]But probably not.
[683:52.65]Thank you for the $15.
[683:53.59]Thank you, Cassif.
[683:55.37]Cass-Aff.
[683:56.55]A-F.
[683:57.47]For the $10.
[683:58.21]I got you earlier, but you said, we're sorry, Jerma.
[684:02.87]Discord didn't do anything wrong.
[684:08.12]No, but everything's going to be fine.
[684:09.50]Don't worry.
[684:11.90]Patriot.
[684:12.76]Patriot Tales.
[684:13.60]Thank you for the $2.82.
[684:15.74]Glad you got that mission select code.
[684:17.44]Me too.
[684:18.08]That would have been such a somber ending to the night.
[684:22.97]I would have been sad, but we're good.
[684:26.07]X, doubt.
[684:29.13]Yeah.
[684:29.67]No.
[684:30.21]No.
[684:32.16]No.
[684:34.44]Star Saber, thanks for the one, zero, zero, zero, thanks for the ten bucks, Star Saber.
[684:39.06]You're gonna take my energy.
[684:41.22]Pretty low on it right now.
[684:44.48]But thank you for your energy, and thank you for the ten dollars.
[684:54.88]Thank you so much, Star Saber.
[684:56.98]Loopy Lou, thanks for $5.
[684:58.40]They just say Shamrock.
[685:03.16]Bream Bin, thanks for the $5.
[685:04.82]Don't give up, Jeremy.
[685:06.54]Yeah, I couldn't end it like that.
[685:07.71]I was struggling.
[685:10.23]I could have just turned the stream off, but no, no, no, no.
[685:12.81]I wouldn't turn it back on.
[685:14.63]I wouldn't go back to Simpsons Hit and Run.
[685:16.21]Am I going to go back to Simpsons Hit and Run to suffer through the last two or three missions?
[685:21.21]No.
[685:21.37]I had to get it done.
[685:28.91]Thank you, Brimpen.
[685:32.15]Yes is online.
[685:33.11]$100.
[685:35.97]This is the Discord apology here.
[685:39.77]Thank you.
[685:41.09]You don't have to apologize, but I really appreciate it.
[685:43.18]That's a huge amount of money.
[685:47.40]I am Monk.
[685:47.86]Thanks for the two bucks.
[685:50.00]Good game.
[685:50.42]Well played.
[685:51.48]Party 100.
[685:51.78]Thank you.
[685:56.44]NitroLemons, thanks for the $1.
[685:57.88]You are a legend for beating this game in one setting.
[686:03.22]Probably not.
[686:05.06]Probably not.
[686:05.58]But I'll definitely say at least I did it.
[686:07.80]You know?
[686:08.32]But I appreciate the very kind words.
[686:12.39]Devlon, 2 million thanks for the $1 Jerm.
[686:14.29]I'm really proud of you for beating the last mission.
[686:21.79]Thanks.
[686:22.07]It means a lot.
[686:25.05]TechnoToast, thanks for the two bucks.
[686:26.43]Jeremy, my boy, I'm so proud of you.
[686:27.99]This is crazy.
[686:28.67]This is a crazy hell game sent by Satan himself.
[686:32.27]Once you get to the last two to three levels, but I'm so glad to see you survived it.
[686:36.03]It's surreal to watch this on stream because my little ten-year-old self lost her damn mind over this fucking shit back in the day.
[686:43.76]Legit, I thought it was just because I was an impatient kid that made it so hard, but you've shown me that the game is actually bullshit.
[686:52.40]Welcome to the I beat The Simpsons hit and run club.
[686:55.15]Fellow gamer.
[687:05.31]I could have done it a lot of different better ways, I know.
[687:10.06]And what initially turned into me being annoyed... Turned into trying to figure it out.
[687:16.94]And then I just kind of lost my mind.
[687:20.03]But...
[687:22.63]Yeah, that was, it was, that was quite the journey.
[687:30.34]But thank you, TechnoToast.
[687:32.34]Glad to be part of the club.
[687:34.42]Here, here.
[687:37.34]Almost done.
[687:38.08]Sroliat just gave the... Sroliat.
[687:41.66]Sroliat.
[687:44.05]Gave a shitload of those community subs.
[687:46.41]Not even 25 minutes ago.
[687:47.43]Thank you so much.
[687:50.96]Manton Min.
[687:53.16]Thanks for the $4.19.
[687:54.46]It is done.
[687:56.42]Thank you, Manton.
[687:58.24]It is done.
[688:00.70]L Giant Rat.
[688:01.58]Thanks for the $3.
[688:02.58]He beat it on stream.
[688:05.38]Yep.
[688:08.12]Gradivis.
[688:08.80]Thank you, Gradivis, for the $2.50.
[688:09.78]You deserve this.
[688:10.28]Thank you.
[688:17.15]Gladalax and thanks for $2.
[688:18.89]Had these saved, but you deserve them.
[688:20.41]Thank you.
[688:23.81]Thank you, guys.
[688:24.53]Thank you.
[688:24.85]Incredibly kind of you.
[688:29.25]Thank you.
[688:33.46]Unstoppable thanks for the $1.
[688:35.00]When you finish this game, you're going to turn yellow.
[688:37.96]Like a Simpson.
[688:42.40]Thank you for the $1.
[688:43.84]Thank you.
[688:45.65]Holly, Holly you again for the $1.
[688:47.74]Wow, what an epic gamer.
[688:48.84]Put that on your resume.
[688:56.00]I mean, it's just an interesting thing to say, I guess.
[688:58.76]I don't know, maybe?
[689:24.40]That's odd that I've caught that every time.
[689:29.85]Interesting stuff.
[689:30.85]That's weird.
[689:34.75]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[689:37.65]ChocoStarfish, thanks for the $1.
[689:39.05]Jerma, amazing stream.
[689:39.90]Loved it.
[689:40.22]Please host LiquidWiFi.
[689:42.24]He's a speedrunner who is running this game right now.
[689:46.66]Well, when we get done with the credits here.
[689:50.95]Definitely go fucking watch that stream to see what a god gamer can do.
[689:55.13]And not a screaming man-child like me.
[690:07.82]Actual god gamer.
[690:11.12]No, I'm kidding.
[690:11.96]I did alright.
[690:12.70]I did okay.
[690:13.48]I did pretty good.
[690:14.72]I did great.
[690:15.62]I did fantastic.
[690:18.04]Could you be... Can anybody be better?
[690:20.18]I don't know.
[690:22.99]But yeah, that's awesome.
[690:25.05]Go check out Liquid Wi-Fi when the stream's over.
[690:27.33]Go watch.
[690:29.37]Or if you don't want to watch this anymore, we're almost done.
[690:32.19]Check it out.
[690:38.96]I might actually pop in there too.
[690:41.82]While I eat my hamburger.
[690:43.66]Hamburger.
[690:44.18]I'm saying that weird.
[690:49.26]Thank you.
[690:49.90]Thank you, the detective, for the $1.
[690:51.20]Hey, Jerma, you just wanted... Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say thank you for the laughs throughout the years.
[690:55.20]My first vid of yours was a live TF2 commentary from seven years ago.
[691:00.68]Much love to you.
[691:01.44]Thank you.
[691:02.38]Thank you, the detective, for the $1, and thanks for being around for seven years.
[691:06.92]That's a significant portion of somebody's life.
[691:08.72]Thank you.
[691:11.08]Dragothorn, thanks for five dollars.
[691:12.90]This is one of those games I'm so embarrassed to have told my friends about.
[691:16.22]The game does not hold up.
[691:17.94]It's like three levels 300 times.
[691:20.90]If it's hard for the almighty Jax, what of us mortals?
[691:25.34]Impossible for us.
[691:27.82]I didn't even realize that was happening until we almost got to the last two chapters of the game.
[691:35.96]That was having a great time, and it was just like, wait a minute, is...
[691:39.77]Are we, like, collecting shit off the back of a car again?
[691:46.22]But then you have to remember, this game is from, like, 2004.
[691:49.56]This didn't come out, like, a week ago.
[691:56.14]I know I... I hate when I get... I mean, half the time I'm just fucking around, but sometimes I'm just like, oh, what a stupid game.
[692:05.00]What an idiot.
[692:05.60]Who fucking made this?
[692:06.62]And it's just like, no, I don't want to be like that.
[692:09.34]I don't want to be that guy.
[692:13.87]It's an old game.
[692:20.27]But thank you, Dragothorn.
[692:23.18]Thank you, LazyLookForTheOneDollar.
[692:24.50]Can you scroll up to watch YouTube videos you skipped like this one?
[692:29.48]Uh, scroll up?
[692:30.28]What do you mean?
[692:44.33]You know I'm going to bed in like 25 minutes.
[692:49.55]You're trying to scare me?
[692:50.73]You know what I just went through?
[692:57.57]Marge Blimpson.
[693:01.15]I just got away from The Simpsons and now I gotta watch this?
[693:11.39]Thank you kill code for the five dollars and thank you kill code as well For a couple of things.
[693:18.17]There's a couple of things kill code 345 needs to be thanked for number one Helping because really this I was gonna do this tomorrow because I was having trouble with mods and stuff Kill code gave me all the files I needed It was great kill code also
[693:36.40]Helped with the telling me where I could unlock all the levels in the mod manager.
[693:40.15]So I don't think I would have ever probably found that It would take me a little bit longer.
[693:45.19]I would have to search around with that alt tab crash the game.
[693:48.05]Thank you kill code And thanks for five dollars right now Hey Jerma.
[693:52.62]This is one of your best dreams ever I was glad to be part of this and was happy to help out get some sleep though jermaFireman Thanks a lot kill code
[694:05.92]Two more.
[694:07.02]CluelessSniper... Oh, wow, that's 12 hours of talking.
[694:10.10]That's how that happens to you.
[694:11.62]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $5.
[694:13.08]Get yourself some fries to go with that burger.
[694:14.66]You've earned it, Jex.
[694:20.40]Thanks a lot, guys.
[694:22.78]Let's get the credits on here.
[694:25.96]Thank you for subbing to this channel, all of you.
[694:30.34]Mom985 says, congrats on completing the world record for longest Jerm has streamed.
[694:41.52]All the resubs, all the new subs, you guys are amazing.
[694:43.20]Thanks a lot.
[694:52.26]So many people support this stream now.
[694:57.30]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[694:58.52]All I can say is thanks.
[695:01.58]Another special thanks to the couple of raids that we had.
[695:04.50]I talked about it before, but Nova... Thank you.
[695:08.38]Like two or three thousand people came in from Nova's stream.
[695:13.44]Thanks a lot, man.
[695:19.33]I think there was another one, too.
[695:20.45]Did I miss a... There was one maybe a little bit later.
[695:30.15]Vinny.
[695:30.39]It was Vinny.
[695:31.86]Yeah.
[695:39.08]Both of you.
[695:39.46]Both of you, communities.
[695:42.13]I know a lot of people have kind of trickled in over the last 6 to 12 months from Vinesauce and from Vinny's streams and shit.
[695:51.12]So, thanks for sticking around.
[695:55.52]Hope you have fun.
[696:03.55]Wow, you're really going to end the stream at only 3 a.m.? ?
[696:10.95]Six?
[696:11.61]I keep forgetting I'm on Pacific.
[696:13.77]How the hell is some of you guys awake?
[696:19.81]Somebody gifted... Oh, God.
[696:25.33]Stayed up all night.
[696:26.13]Well, I hope it was worth it.
[696:30.34]Yeah, I'm going to go eat.
[696:31.54]Probably fall asleep around like 4, 4.30.
[696:34.28]Yeah, tomorrow I'm going to take tomorrow off.
[696:37.70]Or today.
[696:38.46]Today, now, morning, today.
[696:40.88]That's weird to think about.
[696:42.90]So I will see everybody again on Tuesday.
[696:45.08]I think we're gonna slow Gears down a little on Tuesday.
[696:51.17]I've had some incredibly intense streams over the last three or four days.
[696:56.37]With the Metal Gear Rising and then Simpsons Hit and Run.
[697:00.34]I think we're going to slow it down.
[697:01.56]We're going to just chill on Tuesday.
[697:04.86]Maybe play a little bit more Kenshi.
[697:08.02]Something just to relax.
[697:16.45]We'll figure it out.
[697:18.41]Do the Labo stream.
[697:19.47]No, no, no, no.
[697:19.81]You know what?
[697:25.64]If I can get it, 700,000 games part 2 sounds like a really great just- just who cares hangout stream, right?
[697:33.94]I don't know if I can get that for tomorrow, though.
[697:36.30]Yeah, that's pretty low-key.
[697:50.57]Is it primeable?
[697:51.85]If it's primeable, I'll try to get it here in one day.
[697:58.94]That's another 11 hours at least.
[698:03.16]I don't think so.
[698:03.88]I think it'll be fine.
[698:06.27]But... I had a great time.
[698:09.35]Thanks for putting up with my bullshit halfway through.
[698:11.33]I told you I was feeling the grip of Satan on me.
[698:24.51]Just about 12 hours here.
[698:26.55]Have a great rest of your day, rest of your morning.
[698:29.47]Hey, good morning.
[698:31.31]See you on Tuesday around the same time, 3 o'clock Pacific Time.
[698:36.77]Take care, everybody.
[698:38.39]And go watch Liquid Wi-Fi if you want to check out some insane Simpsons hit and run runs.
[698:51.03]Take care, guys.
[698:51.51]I'll see you soon.
