[00:08.84]hey what is going on everybody jerma here with excel for microsoft windows uh it's a gameplay commentary as you can see the background is going to be me using microsoft excel which is probably one of the best releases gaming wise this year and yes I got to get this out of the way yes this is a paid upload I was paid 27 000 to make this video from microsoft from actually the ceo bill gates he handed me
[00:33.22]Actually, two briefcases full of $100 bills.
[00:36.41]And they all were kissed individually by Bill Gates.
[00:39.23]So I take it as you want it.
[00:41.30]But anyways, we're going to talk about Microsoft Excel again.
[00:43.56]This is the best game to come out this year.
[00:45.66]And now we're going to drop this little facade and talk about why I'm bringing this up.
[00:50.03]First of all, let's transition to some actual gameplay here.
[00:52.69]We're gonna transition to- I don't know what it is.
[00:53.99]It's gonna be some random game, could be TF2, it could be SMITE.
[00:57.40]Don't know what the gameplay is, but I do need to bring this up because it seems like every time I upload a video that's not TF2 or that's not like a big AAA title, there's always at least a few people that ask me, did you get paid to upload this video?
[01:14.90]And some people get quite upset over this notion that there could be a video on this channel that somebody paid me for, or any YouTuber, that you got paid to play a game or to talk about a certain game or to upload a certain game.
[01:28.19]And to firstly bring this up to start off talking about this, I have never been paid to play a game.
[01:34.22]That's never happened.
[01:35.74]All the videos on this channel are games that I really enjoy playing, that I've spent a lot of time with, that I actually enjoy the experiences of.
[01:44.30]You're never going to see an upload on this channel of a game that I didn't generally enjoy.
[01:50.23]A game that I didn't... Or, let's rephrase that a little bit...
[01:53.49]Games that just came out can fit in this category too, like if a game just released, I'm doing a review or breakdown or first impressions.
[02:01.19]That's the same thing.
[02:02.21]So I would say those are the two categories of video content on this channel.
[02:06.56]If it's not a skit, if it's not me doing a vlog or just kind of like a general podcast type video where I bring up a topic.
[02:12.54]The gameplay on this channel will always fit into one of those categories.
[02:16.97]I'm never going to just accept from Satan.
[02:19.25]He comes up to me with a contract and he says...
[02:22.21]Jeremy, I want you to sign on the dotted line.
[02:24.45]I'm going to pay you $5,000 for you to upload my shitty game.
[02:33.39]That's not going to happen.
[02:34.65]The only time I've declined, guys, this is what a lot of people don't realize, and a lot of YouTubers can vouch for this as well.
[02:41.46]I've declined a lot of offers from people that I just didn't see as making sense to put on my channel.
[02:47.02]The notion of paid videos irks me.
[02:50.13]It really does.
[02:51.01]It really kind of gets under my skin unless it's something that I'm already a big fan of or something that I'm really excited for.
[02:59.74]But the flip side of the coin here, an argument for something like a paid video or a paid playtime or a stream or something like that, is a lot of YouTubers do this for a living.
[03:10.95]A lot of guys wake up in the morning, myself included.
[03:13.39]We get up in the morning, we come up with these ideas, we try to make new content, we-
[03:17.13]We're always trying to innovate on things, make better videos, trying to make the highest quality videos we possibly can.
[03:21.00]And maybe it is okay for somebody to take a couple of paid videos, because it's just more money in their pocket, more money they can use to spend on improving the channel.
[03:29.00]Buying more games, buying more stuff.
[03:33.00]Now I'm not saying that all these deals should be done because there are some of these deals that are just- let's just face it, downright stupid.
[03:40.00]Like really really stupid and they are completely meaningless videos. Completely meaningless things.
[03:45.12]But there are some things that are worthwhile.
[03:47.34]And the reason why I started this video out as the Microsoft Excel type thing is because that's the type of thing that I see as stupid.
[03:54.51]I see as dumb.
[03:55.59]But if it's an actual gaming video and it's something that the person, the YouTuber, happens to be involved in, then I find that to be okay.
[04:03.09]Especially because of the state of YouTube right now.
[04:05.75]How, you know, monetizing views is so difficult at the moment.
[04:09.39]And it really just comes down to...
[04:11.87]I guess channel integrity.
[04:13.49]Do you want to be known as the guy that has a paid video every two weeks?
[04:16.84]Or do you want to be known as somebody that is supporting good companies or that's supporting their own channel and not taking every single handout from companies that they ever receive?
[04:27.63]But I guess this is the part of the video where I open it up to you guys.
[04:30.99]I want to get a discussion going in the comments.
[04:33.15]Let me know how you feel about this, because, like I said in the beginning, it is a very touchy subject to a lot of people.
[04:40.43]The notion of even ad revenue on YouTube, just by people running ads, it's... you get into a really weird set of waters here, because once you bring money really into anything,
[04:50.40]you can cause a lot of problems and a lot of conflict can arise.
[04:55.04]And in reality, that happens everywhere, not just on YouTube.
[04:59.14]You're talking about every business, every friendship.
[05:02.80]There's so many cases where money can really destroy things.
[05:07.34]And I want to get your opinions on that, so please let me hear them.
[05:11.28]Anyways, that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[05:12.98]So thank you so much for watching.
[05:14.60]I really do appreciate it.
[05:15.94]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[05:17.35]And of course, take care, everybody.
