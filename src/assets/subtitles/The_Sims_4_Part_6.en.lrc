[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.38]Front facing smiling dog.
[00:08.55]Yeah.
[00:13.61]Hey, how are you?
[00:14.63]How you doing?
[00:15.61]Good, cool.
[00:19.81]Oh yeah, more Sims today.
[00:27.94]Sims 4 which gonna check back in with McNulty.
[00:33.73]Uh, I hope I have it saved in the right spot because right immediately after, I believe, um, it was some poison.
[00:43.46]It had, it has to be disposed of coming up here at the birthday party.
[00:49.24]Otto's good.
[00:49.82]Otto's fine.
[00:52.22]Uh, just needed some routine checkup and he needed his shot.
[00:56.68]So he's good.
[01:04.15]If you don't know, Otto has Addison's disease.
[01:09.61]So, he needs, uh, essentially for the rest of his life, he needs to get an injection to help stop some of the symptoms.
[01:21.88]But he lives a perfectly normal, happy life on the medication.
[01:25.40]And he's coming on, I think, 13 or 14 years old here.
[01:29.94]He's doing great.
[01:32.34]But anyways,
[01:34.71]What up?
[01:38.69]Podwatchers skip.
[01:40.41]It's the intro.
[01:41.29]Actually, you could skip the intro.
[01:43.49]You could.
[01:45.43]Actually, I don't disagree with what you said.
[01:47.71]But you're going to miss a very important announcement.
[01:54.91]Very important coming up here.
[01:58.17]Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02.05]Present to you.
[02:05.34]The nominees are open for the end of the year awards.
[02:11.27]You find your way over in the Discord.
[02:13.59]There's a channel there.
[02:15.43]There's going to be some rules you need to follow.
[02:20.45]Please submit any clips over the year for new viewers.
[02:24.31]This is actually, we probably should talk about this.
[02:26.89]So a lot of people here may have joined this community in the last 6-12 months.
[02:34.35]So let me just break this down if you don't know what we do.
[02:37.29]At the end of the year, we do an award show for the channel.
[02:41.72]And it's not just the best things that have happened here, it's also the worst things that have happened here.
[02:47.28]We're talking best joke and worst joke.
[02:51.02]We're talking best stream and worst stream.
[02:54.52]We're talking worst face, worst hair.
[02:58.60]So it's usually pretty much you're trying to find some of these things that make sense for those categories.
[03:06.51]There are a couple of new categories this year.
[03:08.63]Some of you might be really happy to know.
[03:10.97]For instance, we didn't know whether to title it Best or Worst because it makes sense both ways.
[03:20.77]best face no no no best um best overdone Boston moment or worst overdone Boston moment we really didn't know what to call it it's kind of just best overdone Boston moment and I'll give you an example oh I got a fucking Starbucks here dude good luck because I don't even know what you're gonna find
[03:48.31]I don't... There's only like three times this ever happened, I think.
[03:54.88]We literally only know of like three.
[03:57.41]Who knows?
[03:57.91]Maybe some of you might find a bunch of them.
[03:59.61]I don't know.
[04:01.29]That's the fun with these awards.
[04:04.25]Is...
[04:05.85]A lot of them are just kind of horseshit.
[04:08.36]And trying to figure out what people actually find is part of the fun.
[04:13.42]Right?
[04:13.94]Like, worst Boston overdone moment.
[04:17.83]It's like, what the fuck are you, what are you talking about?
[04:21.65]Good luck.
[04:27.61]Best sound, worst sound, yep.
[04:31.05]And yes, some best sounds will be on the worst sound list, and some worst sounds will also be on the best sound list.
[04:37.69]I don't make the rules.
[04:39.38]Except I do.
[04:40.52]I made all the rules.
[04:41.74]So follow them.
[04:44.52]Of course I made the rules.
[04:51.26]What about the example you just gave?
[04:52.66]Can we nominate that?
[04:55.67]Yes, nominations, it's going to be kind of like it was last year.
[04:58.83]So because this is happening not on New Year's Eve anymore, this is happening on around Christmas time.
[05:05.71]So it's going to be pulled back a week or two, this show.
[05:10.09]We need to, so I think it was, what was it?
[05:12.56]December, from December, I think like 15th or something last year and forward till we close nominations in a couple of weeks.
[05:23.93]So I think what we need to do is figure out what was the cutoff period last year?
[05:29.21]I think it was like December 10th last year.
[05:33.19]So anything December 12th or 15th forward, right, is where you can pull clips from.
[05:46.19]When are you going to play modded Skyrim?
[05:48.35]I installed like 150 Skyrim mods and bricked my computer.
[05:52.03]So I just was like, I just uninstalled everything.
[06:01.14]No, it wasn't a virus.
[06:01.90]It's just like Skyrim just wouldn't open anymore.
[06:06.18]I was like, fuck, this is like, I don't even know what's wrong.
[06:16.16]But anyways, yeah, so there's a pinned message that you just saw in the chat.
[06:19.86]There is a nominations channel.
[06:22.38]That's where you go.
[06:23.12]We have a forum.
[06:24.54]After the nominations close, gonna compile everything, gonna vet a bunch of the responses, and you will be able to vote
[06:32.37]as of the second week of December.
[06:34.73]I would say that we're trying to have submissions closed for nominations on the 4th of December, which then you will be able to vote from the 6th or 7th of December all the way till about a day or so before the show.
[06:52.18]Go check the channel.
[06:53.66]And if you don't, again, there's a lot of new people here probably.
[06:56.94]If you don't know what I'm talking about, go skim through some of the previous years.
[07:02.21]This is the fifth year going on, by the way.
[07:06.13]Alright.
[07:07.29]I don't care.
[07:07.73]Do a Mario voice.
[07:09.29]Okay.
[07:10.79]Hello.
[07:12.45]Now go nominate something, okay?
[07:14.20]I just did that for you, so you now go do something for me.
[07:16.22]Go nominate something.
[07:19.19]Alright, we're going to go back to the McNulty house.
[07:20.71]We are going to open this right where we left off.
[07:22.61]We were in the middle of my birthday party.
[07:23.93]Well, it's not my birthday party.
[07:28.41]But it was McNulty's birthday party.
[07:31.53]Divided all of his friends.
[07:32.61]We're going to continue this saga.
[07:36.10]I'm ready to go.
[07:43.26]Oh, by the way, there's an 100 Thieves video that's on the 100 Thieves channel.
[07:50.01]I was on the JHB show, TBH with JHB.
[07:53.29]It was pretty fun.
[07:53.99]It was cool.
[07:54.41]If you want to go check it out, it's on the 100 Thieves YouTube channel.
[08:01.86]It was a fun time.
[08:05.58]You didn't answer one question.
[08:07.67]Yes, I did.
[08:14.48]I answered like 10.
[08:15.02]There was a lot of questions going on.
[08:20.36]You just lied the whole time.
[08:22.34]What?
[08:26.32]No, I didn't.
[08:26.86]What do you mean lied the whole time?
[08:30.44]We were talking about our favorite foods.
[08:35.67]And...
[08:37.08]That, like, AI is getting really weird, isn't it?
[08:40.08]What do you mean lying and making up?
[08:41.56]What are you talking about?
[08:42.40]Do I like Papagino's?
[08:45.49]Papagino's is the best chain pizza you could possibly eat.
[08:49.65]It is the best chain pizza that's available for you to eat.
[08:54.69]People are saying wrong.
[08:56.07]Stop it.
[08:58.12]I'm telling you right now.
[09:00.40]Puppagino's versus something like Domino's.
[09:03.45]Not even a contest.
[09:04.45]It's not even close.
[09:05.81]It's not even fucking close.
[09:11.91]That pizza sucks.
[09:12.73]You are so wrong.
[09:14.03]I can't even believe it.
[09:14.83]That's dog shit.
[09:16.91]That's a dog shit take.
[09:17.83]No, it is not.
[09:18.57]If those of you that are telling me that Domino's is better than Puppagino's... One of two things is the problem.
[09:24.54]One, you've never eaten Puppagino's because it's mostly a Northeast thing.
[09:28.54]So you are just making it up.
[09:30.48]Oh, Domino's is better.
[09:31.28]I've never eaten the other one.
[09:32.51]But that's fine.
[09:33.53]The second one is you got Puppagino's before...
[09:37.23]and it was at a party, and there were 10 pizza boxes lined up in a row, and you ended up getting in line to get your slice of pizza an hour and a half after the pizza showed up.
[09:47.69]So you're like, oh yeah, there's pizza, it is in there.
[09:49.59]And you go in the back, and there it is.
[09:51.47]Okay, there's like the line of pizzas, like six pizzas here.
[09:54.51]We're all like sharing it.
[09:55.89]I'm waiting, I waited an hour to go get a slice.
[09:59.25]You're gonna give me that kind of review?
[10:02.93]Play the game already.
[10:07.18]Play the game.
[10:07.70]I'm gonna play the game already.
[10:11.72]Change your pinned tweet.
[10:13.82]I can't.
[10:14.50]I can't.
[10:14.98]That means I have to go log onto Twitter.
[10:18.66]Well, actually, I was on Twitter.
[10:19.98]I retweeted the 100 Thieves thing.
[10:23.65]But anyways, Domino's doesn't even stand a chance.
[10:27.35]I'm sorry.
[10:28.01]Pizza Hut, I will say.
[10:29.41]I don't know.
[10:30.89]We're stalling for a minute because somebody angered me immensely in this chat by saying that Puppagino's was a shitty place.
[10:38.70]Pizza Hut, stuffed crust pepperoni pizza.
[10:41.30]You got me there.
[10:42.47]You do have me there.
[10:43.69]Every single other item at Pizza Hut is awful.
[10:46.69]Pizza Hut stuffed crust pepperoni pizza is S+.
[10:53.14]Every single other thing there is bad.
[10:55.94]But it's worth going there all the time because they have that one item.
[11:00.62]I feel the same way about Taco Bell.
[11:03.94]The multiverses panel is still up?
[11:05.73]Oh, god damn it.
[11:10.79]Hold on.
[11:11.63]Hold on.
[11:12.19]Hold on.
[11:12.43]Give me a second.
[11:18.20]Is it really there?
[11:18.92]It is, isn't it?
[11:25.92]It is.
[11:26.40]I'm removing it.
[11:28.55]I'm taking it off.
[11:35.55]There it goes.
[11:37.83]It was posting the link every 15 minutes since that stream?
[11:42.17]What?
[11:43.43]I didn't turn it off?
[11:45.92]It was posting the link every 15 minutes since that stream.
[11:50.12]What?
[11:50.74]Hold on.
[11:53.56]Wait a minute.
[11:54.28]You're telling me that... Whatever.
[11:56.34]It's fine.
[11:57.72]Hey.
[11:58.62]Hey, Warner Brothers has been really good to me.
[12:00.48]So, I don't know.
[12:01.52]It's about... I don't care.
[12:04.54]That's fine.
[12:04.88]I don't care.
[12:06.38]Warner Brothers has been wonderful to me.
[12:08.10]That's fine.
[12:09.46]Alright, I'm done stalling.
[12:10.76]I've got my fucking Starbucks.
[12:12.68]Trying to give you some ideas of where you, you know, if you go fucking find something back like last year when I was like fucking talking like this a lot and you can put it in the best overdone fucking Boston accent moment.
[12:22.42]This could be one of them, except it's not because I'm going to, it's going to be deleted, even if you nominate it.
[12:28.15]Because I was giving you an example.
[12:31.31]I actually am looking forward to that category.
[12:34.11]I can't wait.
[12:34.87]I can't wait to see.
[12:37.31]Alright, let's go.
[12:39.88]Yeah, there is WarStream.
[12:40.90]You can nominate WarStream.
[12:41.92]Go ahead.
[12:42.32]Whatever it is, we'll see if it wins.
[12:47.86]What's up?
[12:54.62]Alright, so, last thing.
[12:56.31]Oh, by the way, this was really funny, actually.
[12:58.59]You see this up here?
[13:01.11]I was, like, pissed off.
[13:02.77]Because I was like, why does it say that?
[13:04.03]Why is it doing this?
[13:06.17]It said, like, Itty Bitty Jerma 985.
[13:11.20]I was like, why does it say that?
[13:13.44]That's not cool.
[13:14.73]Why does it say that?
[13:16.81]I didn't know that they cycle through these jokey things up here.
[13:21.17]I thought, for some reason, I thought somebody was fucking with me.
[13:34.92]Alright.
[13:35.96]The last thing we did is people were... I gotta catch this.
[13:45.70]I gotta catch this because I believe we were in the middle of the party, and I believe I was about to poison the cake.
[13:52.66]Just don't ask me why.
[13:53.48]I was- people were saying like, oh, poison!
[13:59.32]Hold on.
[14:03.23]Alright, alright, no, no, no, no, alright, put it away.
[14:06.91]I- right when I- put it away, put it away, put it away.
[14:09.35]Put it away, put it away, put it away.
[14:10.53]My birthday party can't be ruined yet.
[14:12.09]Put it away!
[14:16.82]Why is it lagging so much?
[14:18.28]No!
[14:18.70]Put it away!
[14:21.32]How do I put this away?
[14:22.10]I'm just going to delete it.
[14:26.79]Why is my computer crashing?
[14:32.25]Why is my PC crashing?
[14:39.41]There we go.
[14:39.86]That was weird.
[14:40.84]I don't want anybody to eat this.
[14:48.46]This is not a $10,000 PC.
[14:51.63]Alright, so no, I don't want anyone to eat this.
[14:53.07]Dude, my computer does not like this game right now.
[15:05.10]Why is it playing so bad?
[15:06.50]Alright.
[15:13.28]How do I... Hold on, I gotta like...
[15:16.69]I think my game's like, cash is messed up.
[15:19.55]Help me, this man wants to punch me and steal my money.
[15:24.85]Where?
[15:25.15]Why is this running so bad?
[15:30.11]I'm not punching anybody.
[15:31.23]Alright, I don't want anyone to eat the cake, but I'm going to blow the candles out.
[15:36.39]Alright, it's time to celebrate.
[15:41.34]Nobody eat this.
[15:48.82]I just said I hated the organ.
[16:00.18]You've ruined my birthday party.
[16:05.04]Alright, well, how do I blow out the candles?
[16:16.46]Stop, stop, stop.
[16:18.12]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[16:20.01]Alright, how do I fix this?
[16:29.63]Just take it out of his hand.
[16:31.31]How do I fix this?
[16:36.58]Okay.
[16:47.52]We're good?
[16:48.70]Nobody can eat that cake.
[16:49.60]I don't want anyone to die right now.
[16:56.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[17:03.73]Shit.
[17:04.87]How do I get rid of this?
[17:08.14]Fence the cake in.
[17:13.96]I just want to celebrate the birthday.
[17:15.40]I don't want anyone to eat it.
[17:29.34]Make a new cake.
[17:35.06]How do I just... How do I do the thing?
[17:37.48]Blow out the candles.
[17:38.30]How come I can't blow the candles out?
[17:40.46]Go away from here.
[17:42.57]Go away!
[17:43.47]Don't eat this!
[17:44.29]Whatever.
[17:44.69]I don't even care.
[17:45.23]I have to take it from him, though, because I need to finish the birthday party.
[17:48.27]I have to delete the cake.
[17:50.81]Okay.
[17:56.90]Okay.
[17:59.82]Alright, so I did it.
[18:09.11]Why can't I throw it away?
[18:12.93]Why can't I throw it away?
[18:23.40]I can't sell it.
[18:25.22]I can't put it in my inventory and I can't sell it.
[18:28.92]There's no trash?
[18:31.00]Whoa, what are you doing?
[18:31.92]What's the... Isn't there a DJ supposed to be here?
[18:43.12]Don't touch this cake.
[18:44.14]Nobody touch this cake!
[18:45.50]No!
[18:53.51]Do I need to trash?
[18:58.41]Buy a trash.
[19:06.74]This is a laundry hamper.
[19:11.28]Okay, alright.
[19:18.08]I don't want the party to end before the DJ gets here.
[19:20.96]That's incredibly important.
[19:22.32]Alright, throw it away.
[19:23.06]What was that?
[19:27.49]Alright, throw it away.
[19:28.11]Throw it away.
[19:28.53]Imagine throwing away your birthday cake.
[19:35.84]That's kind of... How do I fix this?
[19:55.03]Don't eat it.
[19:56.03]Don't eat it.
[19:56.49]She has to put it down somewhere.
[19:59.25]Don't eat it standing up.
[20:00.21]There's no room to sit down, but don't eat it.
[20:01.59]I thought she was going to start taking bites out of it.
[20:07.05]Okay.
[20:10.01]Oh, fuck.
[20:10.95]Wait.
[20:11.39]We have a compromise here.
[20:12.29]There's been a compromise.
[20:13.03]Did somebody take one?
[20:16.79]Every road led to this guy taking a piece.
[20:27.00]Nobody got one, right?
[20:32.68]Get rid of this cake and make, make me a new one.
[20:40.46]I want, just throw it away.
[20:42.12]Okay.
[20:45.78]You need to stop doing that.
[20:47.80]Alright, everybody's safe.
[20:51.04]Leave one?
[20:52.22]What do you mean?
[20:52.98]I need to, somebody needs to make me a birthday cake.
[21:02.95]Who is that?
[21:05.55]Somebody make me a cake.
[21:08.21]Wait, what?
[21:10.31]It's you?
[21:11.43]What?
[21:11.79]Wait, you're the, you are the caterer.
[21:14.34]You just haven't been making any food.
[21:15.56]You've been dancing.
[21:17.50]They are the caterer.
[21:18.70]I just hired him again.
[21:19.78]Okay.
[21:20.34]Birthday.
[21:20.76]What?
[21:30.93]Did he eat a slice?
[21:32.59]No, he didn't eat a slice, right?
[21:34.45]Santa just puked.
[21:41.54]What?
[21:43.58]Oh, no.
[21:45.56]Why did he puke?
[21:47.86]What hap- I- He did not eat any cake.
[21:52.84]So what, I just don't get to have a birthday party anymore?
[21:57.69]What?
[22:00.41]He didn't eat any cake.
[22:03.21]Oh my God, that was crazy.
[22:04.35]He just like puked and died.
[22:23.60]I was so diligent though.
[22:29.06]I don't know what happened.
[22:36.12]I didn't... There's a grilled cheese on this counter.
[22:46.37]It's like, dude... Now is not the time to make a grill.
[22:50.31]I want to make a birthday cake.
[22:56.52]Wait, can I... Let's see if I can bring him back.

[56:08.66]I don't know.
[56:09.14]There hasn't been a pantshit in at least 10-15 minutes of in-game.
[56:17.75]Uh-oh, what's going on here?
[56:24.79]Losing control.
[56:25.75]It's alright, put on the lullaby music, you'll be alright.

[58:44.31]You guys are rooting for this guy to die.
[58:51.76]Why are you guys rooting for this guy to die?
[58:57.42]No.

[59:15.79]Make someone worse.
[59:16.59]He's fine.
[59:20.51]Alright, it's about 8 o'clock.
[59:22.91]Turn this off.
[59:24.55]Alright, let's get ready for tomorrow, because tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[59:26.55]We're going to have a big Thanksgiving party, and I'm going to make sure there's a big turkey.
[59:32.65]That's enough of the computer.
[59:35.13]Get up, please.
[59:36.79]Use the bathroom.
[59:40.13]Get a breakthrough.

[60:16.70]Why does he have so much food in his... Why does he have an old coffee from like a year ago?
[60:21.28]I don't want to eat it.
[60:23.61]Is this cake fine?
[60:25.09]Why is the cake spoiled?
[60:33.19]Well, I'm asleep.
[60:36.30]I made the cake two days ago.

[119:07.30]What?
[119:14.57]I'm sorry, but when you give me this option here that's neighborhood brawl, how come nobody's... I'm going to the gym.
[119:23.23]I have to turn off the Fortnite shit.
[119:28.93]Is that death?
[119:42.08]What else can I even do?
[120:13.62]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[120:16.56]Apparently, I still... I was never supposed to do this in the first place because it's too old.
[120:23.00]I'm too old.
[120:25.42]Whoa, whoa!
[120:50.62]What?
[120:57.34]I'm arrested?
[120:58.18]How long am I in jail for?
[121:15.14]Winter.
[121:30.21]I broke out of jail.
[121:31.43]That's not what I wanted to do.
[121:34.73]My God, dude.
[121:38.26]How does that happen?
[121:40.00]I don't know.
[121:40.46]Just go home.
[121:41.90]Just go home at this point.
[121:42.94]What the hell am I going to do now?
[121:54.29]Okay.
[121:56.03]Prison break.
[122:01.65]That's what?
[122:02.51]So what now what?
[122:17.27]By the way, the maid didn't even come and I paid for it.
[122:31.45]Oh, never mind.
[122:39.77]You ain't shit.
[122:43.78]Oh, birds.
[122:44.60]It's a cardinal.
[122:58.49]Cool.
[123:00.22]Okay, so, um... What's coming up next?
[123:05.82]Oh, Winterfest is back!
[123:11.14]Starlight Accolades.
[123:15.45]What does that mean?
[123:19.19]I don't know what that is.
[123:22.69]Alright, I actually really do need to clean.
[123:25.03]This is ridiculous.
[123:28.07]Oh, Doofka.
[123:30.01]Take the decorations down.
[123:31.04]It's over.
[123:31.68]We're in winter.
[123:43.52]Okay.
[123:45.08]So... How's my career doing?
[123:51.37]I did four breakthroughs.
[123:54.61]Okay.
[123:55.65]As of tomorrow, I think I'll be alright.
[123:57.67]Yeah, Yodel died.
[123:58.63]Yeah.
[123:59.03]Yeah.
[124:00.35]A couple hours ago.
[124:01.95]Do life goals, not dreams.
[124:05.71]Okay, I need a logic.
[124:08.39]Finished reading three books.
[124:09.55]Just read a logic book.
[124:10.87]I think I have to buy a book, right?
[124:17.38]Alright, I need logic.
[124:24.06]Logic 2, right?
[124:25.50]Logic Volume 2.
[124:26.64]Let's go ahead and read that.
[124:31.48]Go read Logic Volume 2.
[124:33.68]Pretty sick.
[124:38.96]Need to read a couple books.
[124:45.52]Is that working?
[124:52.60]Oh.
[124:54.62]I don't care.
[124:57.54]Why won't I finish the book?
[125:04.76]I need volume three.
[125:07.36]What?
[125:12.49]Are you serious?
[125:17.71]250 bucks.
[125:18.35]Are you kidding me?
[125:25.76]What?
[125:26.98]Why not?
[125:34.56]Why?
[125:34.66]Because I punched that guy in the stomach.
[125:39.58]Why can't I read this?
[125:47.28]Can I cancel the maid service?
[125:49.82]Because I'm just cleaning up the house.
[125:52.42]I need volume one.
[126:05.29]What is this?
[126:06.69]A festival of youth.
[126:07.83]Ice cream crepes.
[126:11.43]Blessings and a void critter hunt.
[126:13.83]This is cool.
[126:23.71]It's Pokémon Go.
[126:31.46]You're too old?
[126:32.06]I think I am too old.
[126:40.60]I'm too old.
[126:41.64]I'm not going to that.
[126:43.10]I'm not going to that.
[126:45.25]I'm sorry.
[126:45.69]I don't think I can go there.
[126:47.67]Alright, I'm getting rid of this.
[126:57.57]This is just bringing the mood down.
[127:03.19]Well, good thing I did that and I just paid a service to come and clean the house.
[127:07.10]And they're not going to do anything tomorrow.
[127:16.00]I have to go to work tomorrow anyways.
[127:17.31]We have to do aspirations.
[127:18.49]I'm not fucking around.
[127:19.47]I need to finish reading three books.
[127:22.03]Does it matter what the book is?
[127:23.39]How about Crisis Barn?
[127:28.69]Does the book matter?
[127:36.86]Yeah, you get it.
[127:40.94]You get it.
[127:41.28]Alright, I need two more books.
[127:48.82]Have a child.
[127:50.50]Guys, I'm like 80.
[127:51.34]I'm like 85.
[127:54.24]Have a child?
[127:54.86]What?
[127:55.20]That's for a different sim.
[128:01.12]Alright, I finished that book.
[128:07.34]What time is work?
[128:10.96]Tomorrow.
[128:11.44]Alright, so I got time.
[128:13.56]I'll get promoted.
[128:15.22]Adopt, adopt, adopt, adopt.
[128:16.80]What?
[128:18.37]I'm not going to adopt a kid and die.
[128:20.35]Buy a youth potion.
[128:27.51]What else am I doing?
[128:33.80]Alright, I need some food.
[128:35.36]I gotta get promoted.
[128:41.10]Check your rewards.
[128:46.34]I need to own a business too.
[128:47.28]How do I buy a business?

[129:04.91]Speed cleaner.
[129:09.23]Storm?
[129:10.11]Wait, potion of youth.
[129:12.11]Drink this to turn back the clock on your sim's current age.
[129:14.84]Should I drink one of these?
[129:20.51]I feel like that's going against the natural order here.
[129:24.23]Do it.
[129:25.07]No, let him die.
[129:25.91]This is going against the natural order, I think.
[129:33.36]Do a poll?
[129:33.88]Alright, let's do a poll.
[129:36.22]Do you want me to keep Blorg McNulty around?
[129:39.10]Or do you want Blorg... Well, let's get this cleared up here.
[129:42.99]Do you want Blorg McNulty to drink the potion of youth?
[129:49.21]Get a poll up.
[129:50.11]Yes or no?
[129:50.43]What do you think?
[129:54.11]How do you feel?
[129:58.44]What do you think?
[130:05.24]No?
[130:05.66]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[130:08.48]There is a lot of no's coming out right now.
[130:11.74]There's a lot of yes's too though.
[130:15.70]That's a lot.
[130:19.63]You guys want this guy to fuck off so bad?
[130:30.77]That's 75% almost.
[130:32.68]We're not doing that.
[130:34.38]Thanks for voting.
[130:36.62]No, we're not.
[130:39.06]Should I buy something else, though?
[130:50.13]Instant fun.

[150:48.07]I'm not doing that.
[150:48.95]My reputation is so... Why did they close the stores for five minutes?
[150:52.33]Someone's beeping at me.

[224:34.19]What's wrong?
[224:34.68]Why am I glowing?
[224:53.90]Oh, you want to do a fart-off, don't you?
[224:55.69]You want to do a fart-off?
[224:57.68]I got you.
[224:58.30]Okay.
[225:21.78]Alright.
[225:23.50]Alright.
[225:23.94]Alright.
[225:25.23]Alright.
[225:25.79]That's enough.
[225:53.20]Why is it so dark?
[225:54.06]This is ominous.
[225:59.97]It is dark out here.
[226:01.19]Like, really dark.
[226:11.29]I can't... This is an expensive stove, too.
[226:13.64]That's such bullshit.
[226:21.12]I can't replace it.
[226:35.28]Wanna play?
[226:39.60]I need to take a bath.
[226:40.98]Or a shower or something.
[226:43.73]This is funny.
[226:44.45]This was funny.
[226:45.07]But it's time to buy an actual toilet.
[226:48.15]We need to have them be able to go to the bathroom.
[226:51.57]Actual toilet time.
[227:10.45]Okay, that's better.
[227:12.19]Alright.
[227:17.11]How are you doing?
[227:18.65]Need to go to the bathroom.
[227:19.31]Go to the bathroom.
[227:22.39]Sad.
[227:24.34]What an awful holiday.
[227:25.52]How long do you sleep for?
[227:41.31]Like, four hours.
[227:42.09]That's actually not very much time.
[227:49.89]Still, I have $96.
[227:51.12]This sucks.
[227:54.70]Um... What the hell am I supposed to do about this?
[228:01.66]This shit still works.
[228:02.96]Whatever, we're just gonna have to eat microwave food for a little while.
[228:10.84]Fury...
[228:12.79]As Fury grows, their animalistic instincts begin to manifest and will eventually take over.
[228:17.51]Fury gain is constant and is hastened by Werewolf Ability's full moon preferences.
[228:23.29]Wait, so I turn?
[228:24.81]Alright, well, you're going to clean this up.
[228:35.07]What is this?
[228:39.15]Porta Potties?
[228:42.33]Portal potties.

[230:13.62]Let's go.
[230:15.34]Oh.
[230:46.68]Coming together Attempt simlish communication
[231:17.14]I'm pretending to be human?
[231:20.00]This would be weird.
[231:47.41]This is weird.
[231:48.13]This would be very weird.
[231:54.53]It's at this moment where this roommate kind of just goes... How much is it for me to break the lease?
[232:04.64]And leave.
[232:08.16]Come on, dude.
[232:15.67]The beast beckons.
[232:20.55]What?
[232:21.73]Wait, he's lost control?
[232:28.57]He's kind of just being taken over?
[232:29.87]He still knows how to use a phone.
[232:32.75]Where's the cat?
[232:43.27]How is this fridge already broken?
[232:46.00]It's been one day.
[232:47.84]How is it already broken?
[232:52.02]What the fuck?
[232:54.78]It's... It's been one day.
[232:57.69]He's already going back to bed?
[233:00.59]Why?
[233:02.09]Awful holiday.
[233:03.07]Is it because I was licking my hands?
[233:12.68]That thing's cute.
[233:17.08]Okay, I need to... I need to... What am I doing here?
[233:20.14]I need to eat something.
[233:33.97]What?

[234:21.57]Okay.
[234:22.67]Are there other werewolves coming over here?
[234:43.50]I look like I belong in a Wallace and Gromit movie.
[234:48.31]A police cruiser's been dispatched?
[234:52.48]Oh shit, I definitely did it!
[235:19.00]Oh, God.
[235:19.50]No!
[235:48.93]Who are these people?
[235:54.70]What happened?
[235:56.44]Wait, what did I do?
[235:58.66]Why is he dead?
[236:00.18]Why is he dead?
[236:08.37]Why did that guy die?
[236:18.74]Whose guts am I ripping out?
[236:22.44]This guy's not dead.
[236:28.54]He fell asleep.
[236:45.29]This guy's asleep.
[236:51.52]He took a book off the shelf.
[236:52.98]Okay, why won't this guy get up?
[236:58.00]He's in regular clothes.
[237:24.61]Where did I just go?
[237:25.21]Ugh.
[237:55.33]I don't know what's going on here, but you need to go home.
[238:01.05]Okay.
[238:01.75]Well, that was cool, I guess.
[238:08.32]Where's the house?
[238:20.27]He got up.
[238:20.71]He got up.
[238:21.21]He woke up.
[238:21.75]He woke up.
[238:29.47]Oh.
[238:38.12]Well, that was kind of crazy.
[238:45.56]Do not save.
[238:57.90]That was wacky.
[239:21.61]A helicopter like... I don't even know what happened there.
[239:24.17]Wait, I'm enraged still.
[239:30.00]How do I stop?
[240:01.02]How do I stop?
[240:12.38]Slay with a silver sword.
[240:14.08]I don't know what to do.
[240:22.34]How do I get him to actually... When does he stop doing this?
[240:24.58]Two more hours?
[240:25.68]Well, alright, whatever.
[240:26.50]Good luck.
[240:29.70]I got points.
[240:43.00]We'll just hang out in here.
[240:46.14]Just lock him outside.
[240:48.78]That's actually not a bad idea.
[240:49.86]Alright, just chill out of there.
[241:00.91]Bored?
[241:01.35]There's no decorations?
[241:09.49]Alright, somebody has to get a job.
[241:10.95]And it's definitely not going to be you.
[241:19.69]Why is this person in the house?
[241:22.59]This guy sucks.
[241:28.64]Why is this person in the house?
[241:52.23]This guy's a fucking dork.

[242:09.96]Who are these people?
[242:11.86]They've shown up twice.
[242:18.56]Gary's now a werewolf runt.
[242:28.24]Oh god, where am I going?
[242:30.54]I'm chasing this guy down.
[242:49.32]Werewolf hangouts?
[242:56.99]I can't do any of this stuff.
[243:31.49]Oh, I'm back to normal now.
[243:40.16]I'm back to normal.
[243:46.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[243:50.60]That's not happening.
[244:04.14]We have no money.
[244:04.90]What did I spend up?
[244:06.30]We've got a stupid plasma screen TV.
[244:08.37]Just get rid of this.
[244:16.01]God damn it.
[244:16.75]We have to do this stupid shit again.
[244:18.31]I have to start over again.
[244:23.50]I have to start over.
[244:24.12]I have to start over.
[244:25.88]I have to start over.
[244:26.48]I'm going to start over.
[244:27.90]I'm starting over.
[244:30.01]I can't do this in the house, right?
[244:32.49]Wait, why is it you?
[244:45.06]Why did he do that?
[244:46.56]With a bowl of fucking cereal.
[245:04.09]One hand holding a bowl of sausage.
[245:07.49]What are you eating?
[245:09.19]What is he eating?
[245:13.49]What is in his hand?
[245:14.43]He's already- what?
[245:34.19]Excuse me?

[246:09.39]Alright, I gotta stop.
[246:19.37]Alright.
[246:20.65]No more.
[246:21.17]We're not doing any more.
[246:25.66]We're going to... You're gonna do your time here.
[246:35.07]We're just going to relax now.
[246:37.79]We're going to get a job.

[247:52.06]Actually, I need you, so... Somebody has to repair this.
[248:05.35]You repair that.
[248:06.41]I'll repair the coffee maker.

[283:10.96]Santa, I think, has to pee.

[285:14.11]The group wasn't prepared for the climb.
[285:15.61]They showed up at the mountain.
[285:19.47]Where did he go?
[285:24.00]Where did he go?

[286:16.19]I didn't know you had to have a climbing skill.
[286:21.18]I guess it's a new skill?
[286:22.12]Because I was building a meter.
[286:24.22]Hey, fancy some... Um... Okay?

[299:37.70]Console about death?
[299:38.96]Somebody died?
[299:52.70]Well, that's okay.
[300:10.71]It's the people that I killed.
[300:12.47]Why did I do that?
[300:13.07]Alright, let's go home.
[300:18.92]Back to the house.
[300:19.42]That was a... Wait.
[300:21.08]We didn't even count down the new year.
[300:23.53]Ah, well.
[300:24.09]Just... Just pretend we did.
[300:28.75]Just pretend we did.
[300:29.47]That's fine.
[300:44.04]Larb.
[300:47.00]Jerry ruins another holiday.
[300:48.90]Okay.
[300:54.10]Back here.
[300:56.40]So if you're curious what we're doing tomorrow, tomorrow I'm streaming.
[300:59.06]Tomorrow is obviously Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[301:03.07]Probably going to start the stream a little bit later in the day.
[301:08.15]Because...
[301:10.93]I figured people would be, you know, eat your turkey, have your stuffing and your Thanksgiving.
[301:16.47]And then later on in the evening, guess what came out three days ago?
[301:23.62]Hatsune Miku Picross.
[301:33.87]Hatsune Miku Picross is out.
[301:36.60]So we're going to chill, eat your food.
[301:39.74]We'll hang out for a few hours tomorrow evening on Thanksgiving.
[301:44.56]Should be a chill stream.
[301:46.74]There's been a few wild ones here, so chill it out.
[301:52.85]That's the plan.
[301:54.83]Are we all in the house?
[301:55.83]Okay, yeah, yeah, good, good, good.
[301:56.63]I've been playing it for a few days.
[302:01.53]Is it any good?
[302:14.35]I'm not going to the flea market.
[302:15.29]I don't care.
[302:24.54]Turn this off.
[302:25.38]I don't like having that there.
[302:28.44]Go pee.
[302:28.86]Go on.
[302:32.26]It's Picross, so it's fun.
[302:33.38]Cool.
[302:34.96]Does it play music?
[302:35.75]I would imagine it probably does.
[302:41.58]Oh, yeah.
[302:41.98]Let me just say one more time before I start to cool it out here.
[302:47.53]If you want to nominate something, the end of the year awards nominations are open as of right this very moment.

[304:09.87]These games are so much fun with the mods.
[304:11.73]It's just I know that if I have the ability to do this, for instance, like... What's one that we didn't see that I want to see?
[304:19.56]There's only those two.
[304:29.52]Steal money...

[305:10.76]Oh, no.
[305:31.92]That was a little elaborate.
[305:34.72]That was a little too much.
[305:41.55]Okay.
[305:45.61]Stop killing Sims.
[305:46.53]I don't have all day.
[305:53.04]I saved it right before.

[310:12.07]Where's the cat?
[310:18.04]Oh, cat's fine.
[310:33.34]That's been fun.
[310:35.78]We've completely gone off the rails, though, unfortunately.
[310:51.63]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[310:52.55]That's going to be it.
[310:57.39]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[310:59.01]Have a good Thanksgiving, if you celebrate it.
[311:04.13]That was, uh, the...
[311:36.68]Alright, that's it.
[311:54.83]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[311:55.57]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Miku Picross.
[312:02.52]Probably somewhere around... What's a good time?
[312:08.49]Maybe like later in the night, just like a chill night stream.
[312:12.84]I think that sounds like a good idea.
[312:16.70]Maybe like 5, 6 p.m.
[312:18.64]Pacific.
[312:18.96]6 p.m.
[312:20.08]Pacific.
[312:21.76]Have like a late night, just chill Picross stream for a little bit.
[312:24.37]Wind down from Thanksgiving.
[312:27.73]That sounds like a plan to me.
[312:28.41]So see you tomorrow at 6 p.m.
[312:34.84]Late night.
[312:37.81]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[312:38.65]Again, this has been Sims 4.
[312:40.83]We'll probably play it again.
[312:41.57]I, uh... We just kind of... It just went off the rails.
[312:46.25]And actually, I'm getting hungry, so I'm going to go eat some food.
[312:52.10]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[312:53.86]Happy Thanksgiving.
[312:54.90]Have a good one.
[312:57.92]Goodbye.
[312:59.36]Good night.
[313:02.28]Thanks for watching.
[313:02.84]Thanks for the support.
[313:05.78]There were a ton of subs today, so thanks, guys.
[313:07.90]Appreciate it.
[313:12.58]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[313:19.54]Please play Sorcery.
[313:21.86]What about your internet dropping it?
[313:23.22]Oh, that's a good point.
[313:25.82]Eh.
[313:27.95]It's Picross.
[313:29.35]There's not much going on on the screen.
[313:38.40]Even if I drop some frames, it's not very much going on bitrate wise.
[313:52.07]So yes, so I don't know.
[313:54.89]We kind of need to figure out what's going to happen with that.
[313:58.01]I did say that I would get into the third game and see if I was still into it, see how people are into it.
[314:05.06]Maybe we'll do some just chill late night streams or something.
[314:08.41]Get some of it done.
[314:15.53]Breath of the Wild?
[314:16.61]We played Breath of the Wild a few days ago.
[314:19.13]I'm still into it.
[314:30.40]Please, please play more sorcery.
[314:34.03]What date is the actual award stream?
[314:35.91]I don't have a hard date for you.
[314:38.61]But I can tell you it will be... It will be near... It'll be before Christmas.
[314:46.93]It'll be at least a few days.
[314:48.97]At least three or four days before Christmas.
[314:51.94]That I can assure you.
[315:00.58]But see you tomorrow.
[315:01.60]Have a good Thanksgiving.
[315:02.28]Good night.
[315:02.78]See you guys later.
[315:06.58]Again, the awards are open.
[315:08.36]Nominations are open.
[315:09.44]If you think that's something you wanted to keep, you want to make sure that you made the nomination aware, go do it.
[315:15.74]It's in the Discord.
[315:16.34]There's a channel in the Discord right now.
[315:18.22]GrottoBeasts.net Go check that out too.
[315:21.63]That's very close.
[315:23.25]If you haven't checked it out, haven't signed up already, it's a great way for us to understand how many units we actually really need.
[315:30.37]So GrottoBeasts.net End of the year award nominations.
[315:37.13]Christmas show.
