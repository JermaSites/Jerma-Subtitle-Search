[ve:60.16.100]

[01:02.66]How are you?
[01:07.40]How are things going?
[01:08.00]Good?
[01:08.20]So this is day three.
[01:14.93]Playing House Flipper.
[01:16.65]Two for the House Flipper weekend.
[01:24.03]And as you know, it's currently before 11 a.m.
[01:29.80]So I get to talk like this for a little while.
[01:33.26]So remember, if you ever booked me to do a movie trailer, a birthday party, a cool character, keep in mind that studio time has to be before 11 o'clock in the morning Pacific time.
[01:52.21]But I have range.
[01:55.52]I mean, as you can clearly tell over the last... Hold on, that was not good.
[02:03.12]Over the last four or five days.
[02:07.90]And I'm available, yeah.
[02:09.85]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[02:10.75]I'm back.
[02:11.11]It's me.
[02:12.45]How are you?
[02:13.51]I'm late today, I know.
[02:17.47]I'm actually very late.
[02:19.59]My plan was to be... Oh my god, hold on.
[02:21.75]I gotta get up.
[02:22.31]I gotta wake up.
[02:24.74]Alright, you know when you wake up and you're just like... And even a coffee doesn't work.
[02:32.54]I hate it.
[02:34.36]Did you sleep in?
[02:36.06]Maybe a little.
[02:37.88]Nice cottage cheese voice, yo.
[02:41.66]I got up at like 9.
[02:43.26]But... I got up at like, what, 8?
[02:45.02]No, 8.45.
[02:45.46]And I did that thing that I hate doing where you... Just look at the clock.
[02:52.42]And you go...
[02:53.83]Oh, alright.
[02:55.13]Cool.
[02:56.19]I got plenty of time.
[02:58.54]And then it sucks so bad because you're at your kind of most tired in that period and you time travel.
[03:06.74]I will roll around in bed trying to fall asleep desperately for four or five straight hours sometimes.
[03:17.07]But the moment that you wake me up and I've got an hour to still sleep
[03:22.70]And you get that, holy shit, this is amazing.
[03:25.10]When you hear the G of amazing in your head, it's time to get up again.
[03:30.24]It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[03:31.98]What do you mean?
[03:33.62]I just said, this is amazing.
[03:36.60]And now it's been an hour.
[03:37.36]No, it hasn't.
[03:39.43]I just said, this is awesome.
[03:40.49]This is bullshit.
[03:41.11]It's like, what?
[03:43.07]It's 924?
[03:43.25]It was just 830.
[03:44.03]No, it's impossible.
[03:45.91]But yeah.
[03:53.65]I slept in a little.
[03:55.63]But it's good.
[03:55.99]We're here.
[03:56.21]Hanging out.
[03:58.73]This is the final time you'll see me play House Flipper 2 for a little bit.
[04:03.10]I obviously plan on playing it more.
[04:05.42]But it's for this period here.
[04:07.90]We had the Invitational.
[04:09.20]We had these few streams.
[04:10.44]And then I'm going to do a bunch of holiday stuff.
[04:17.73]The finale.
[04:18.27]Well, this is the finale of this block of House Flipper 2.
[04:26.78]Is the last stream of the year?
[04:27.90]I don't know.
[04:31.64]Because it depends on when what my travel plans are.
[04:35.58]And I have a lot of stuff for a lot of off brand work that I have to do.
[04:39.38]At the last I want to say.
[04:42.30]Seven days or so I've been focusing on the House Lover Invitational and these streams obviously, so I've got a lot of work to do for off brand before the holiday break.
[04:53.93]I owe people documents, okay?
[04:55.86]I owe people documents.
[04:57.14]Let's just get there.
[05:00.70]The Last Supper.
[05:01.62]Are there going to be no awards?
[05:09.21]There are not going to be any awards this year, but there's an asterisk on that.
[05:14.03]Hold on.
[05:15.94]My plan this year is to do, this is a great, this is a great kind of suggestion from the community, is do kind of like a, just play something and do like a hangout, kind of remember the last year clip show and just show some stuff that people liked.
[05:37.30]Talk about it a little bit.
[05:38.97]Kind of like we did before, but just not here is 25 categories and like 40 nominees in each category.
[05:50.04]Just something chill, something easy.
[06:00.63]Can we at least do worse noise?
[06:02.77]I have an idea this year, and it's going to be something I'm going to ask a few people, especially on the editing team that we have.
[06:13.78]Do you guys think it's funny?
[06:14.83]Now, this is really... I don't know how long this would be, but I...
[06:19.33]Do you think it would be funny?
[06:22.07]I don't know.
[06:22.37]This video might be so long.
[06:24.63]It might be unbearable.
[06:26.98]But instead of worst noise, it's worst noises over the last 12 years.
[06:35.40]And it's like a super cut compilation of just probably to the tune of like, I don't know, one of those old Mozart songs.
[06:47.40]Like... There's like piano in the background.
[06:55.29]It's just fucking crazy.
[06:57.85]That might be a three hour video.
[06:59.65]So I... I'm cooking.
[07:02.43]We're cooking.
[07:03.07]We're cooking.
[07:03.51]I'm cooking some stuff.
[07:06.43]I wanted to do that last year.
[07:09.79]Because there were so many submissions.
[07:12.59]But now... I think it makes a little bit more sense this time, right?
[07:20.79]Yeah, if you don't do it, somebody else will.
[07:22.43]Yeah, well, I'm doing an official one.
[07:24.85]Probably.
[07:25.31]Because I find that to be pretty funny.
[07:38.18]I just popped in.
[07:38.74]What did bro just say?
[07:39.64]Does somebody have timestamps for all those?
[07:43.98]Well, we don't need all of them, really.
[07:45.48]We just need like a... We need like a five-minute video worth of...
[07:55.92]Yeah, I'm cooking.
[07:58.94]So it'd be more like a... Hey, remember all that fun stuff?
[08:04.05]Versus, hey, vote on what should win.
[08:09.33]But this is not going to be New Year's Eve.
[08:10.79]Like I said, I plan on... Over the last five years or so, there's lots of people who I, you know, family and friends who I haven't really seen that much or spent very much time with.
[08:23.42]I definitely want to spend some more time with my family.
[08:27.28]My poor mother.
[08:30.24]When am I going to see you again?
[08:31.26]I don't know.
[08:35.39]Soon, maybe.
[08:40.55]Got a lot of traveling I want to do over the next couple of weeks.
[08:46.89]Call your mother for Pete's sake?
[08:48.14]Hey, I call my mother.
[08:49.10]I do.
[08:50.56]I call my mother once a week.
[08:54.88]That's the Sunday phone call.
[08:56.04]God damn it.
[08:58.48]Hey, nobody messes with the Sunday phone call with Ma.
[09:01.82]You understand that?
[09:09.61]I'll be calling her in like three or four hours.
[09:19.28]What do you call her?
[09:19.90]I call her Ma.
[09:22.60]Hey, Ma.
[09:24.52]Hey, Ma.
[09:24.82]Ma.
[09:25.52]Ma.
[09:27.85]It's a Ma.
[09:30.17]We're a Ma family.
[09:39.14]It's funny because I don't call my dad like Pa, but like Da.
[09:46.04]It's Dad.
[09:47.38]Hey, Dad.
[09:48.39]Hey, what's up, Dad?
[09:50.87]It's Ma.
[09:51.93]I don't say, hey, Mom.
[09:52.83]I go, hey, Ma.
[09:54.91]Interesting.
[09:55.29]That's funny.
[10:05.85]Or we call my dad the Faja.
[10:08.25]From, you know, Austin Powers.
[10:12.39]If you've seen Austin Powers, you'll know.
[10:18.07]We do that too.
[10:18.77]I feel like a lot of people did that after Goldmember.
[10:22.08]Yeah, since Goldmember, I think a ton of families took on Faja.
[10:26.88]As what they call their dad.
[10:28.32]That's funny.
[10:32.66]We still do that though.
[10:36.87]The movie came out 20 years ago.
[10:46.95]You are so Michael Scott.
[10:48.71]Why what?
[10:59.32]Hey.
[11:00.50]Michael Scott ran a successful company.
[11:05.69]He tried to be good to his employees.
[11:11.65]You did?
[11:13.49]I haven't seen.
[11:14.27]Okay.
[11:15.79]I'm not going to look at chat.
[11:18.05]I have not seen The Office.
[11:19.61]I know.
[11:19.83]Somebody's going to throw a tomato at me.
[11:21.98]I have not seen The Office.
[11:23.64]I've seen like maybe 10 episodes of the entire series patchworked together from various television networks that I caught in the middle of their episode that they were airing on whatever network it was on.
[11:39.95]So my office, what I've seen of the office is one gigantic episode that is about like nine hours long or like six hours long.
[11:51.71]That is just patchworked together from a bunch of different episodes.
[11:56.42]I've seen the chili fall.
[11:58.16]That was very funny.
[12:01.00]I saw the, hey, it was very, very nice moment when Michael goes to the art gallery and
[12:10.30]Chat is pretending the office is bad.
[12:13.66]Chat pretends everything is bad.
[12:16.82]Chat, what do you like?
[12:22.35]What does Chat actually like?
[12:23.73]You.
[12:26.51]Oh, that was like... That was like really sweet.
[12:43.16]He just got flustered.
[12:44.42]I like Bugsnax.
[12:47.34]Clever auto.
[12:48.20]Alright.
[12:53.41]Let's get going.
[12:54.37]This is also again.
[12:55.93]This is sponsored stream.
[12:56.63]This is the last stream that you'll see of house number two that's sponsored.
[13:01.94]I will be playing it again.
[13:03.48]100 million percent.
[13:05.92]They already started talking about content updates and patches and that kind of community things that people have been asking for over the last few days.
[13:14.39]So I think they're already working on stuff right now.
[13:16.67]So I'm sure we'll see something soon.
[13:18.55]What kind of lizard are you going to get?
[13:27.38]I don't know.
[13:29.03]Yeah, the plan today is to, I want to go into sandbox mode.
[13:33.09]I haven't really explored very much in sandbox mode.
[13:35.35]I haven't really done very much in it.
[13:37.23]And I know you saw me flying around noclip in sandbox mode.
[13:41.27]But for the, I want to say like the three or four days preceding the invitational, the only thing I was worrying about is talking to 20 different people or so and making sure they understood certain things.
[13:54.34]And hey, here's this file.
[13:55.74]And OK, I need to make sure I can answer a question if somebody asks it.
[14:00.30]If somebody asked me, hey, dude, I'm in sandbox mode.
[14:02.51]I don't know.
[14:02.85]How do you like remove this section of a wall as the runner of that event?
[14:07.41]I cannot go.
[14:08.25]I don't know.
[14:13.36]So I haven't really played it.
[14:15.02]I've kind of just flown around and put one or two walls up and what you doing that like Keebler out freehouse thing.
[14:21.32]That was a. I was I was just on autopilot for the most part so.
[14:29.53]Today I plan on actually spending some time in it and just learning it messing around.
[14:35.23]May I want to make something that I spend like 345 hours on.
[14:38.77]You know I mean.
[14:41.39]You're gonna play you just yapping.
[14:49.67]fair that's fair well I'm waiting for people to trickle in it's a I gotta have some things to talk about hey there it is uh hey hold on a second though
[15:19.59]It'll move a little better.
[15:23.55]You know.
[15:26.11]It's not a big deal.
[15:29.29]Oh, what's that?
[15:29.73]Oh, what's that?
[15:30.79]Oh, yeah.
[15:31.45]You want me to join?
[15:33.53]You want to join up?
[15:34.99]Hey.
[15:35.45]Hey.
[15:35.75]Yeah.
[15:36.05]I'll join up.
[15:36.43]What do you want me to join up with?
[15:44.48]I didn't put the buttons on yet.
[15:48.12]But, hi.
[15:49.53]Oh my god, I just looked at the bright screen and I just woke up like an hour ago.
[15:58.22]Yeah.
[15:59.42]Uh, this ain't gonna be on, by the way.
[16:01.82]This is just to prove that I'm alive to a lot of you for some reason.
[16:08.97]Yeah, no ponytail.
[16:11.61]I did the ponytail for a bit for four hours.
[16:15.29]I'm not a ponytail guy right now, no.
[16:23.07]Nice Lego hair.
[16:23.75]Yeah.
[16:25.91]Hey, Lego hair sounds actually kind of incredible because what's that?
[16:30.41]You don't have to style it.
[16:31.31]You don't have to do anything.
[16:32.17]It's just there and it just sits on you.
[16:34.79]I wish I had Lego hair because that would be amazing.
[16:40.83]Yeah.
[16:46.06]Hey, look at that.
[16:48.84]Talk about this one more time.
[16:53.00]You have until the 31st again to enter the House Slipper 2 Community Contest.
[17:00.90]What is... What... Jeremiah, what is the House Slipper 2 Community Contest?
[17:04.58]Well, hold on.
[17:05.20]Sit the fuck down for a second.
[17:06.54]Let me explain it to you.
[17:13.05]So, and there's 4,000... 5,000 entries.
[17:13.89]Now...
[17:22.83]Yeah, they're doing a community contest.
[17:23.89]We've talked about it a few times.
[17:25.89]But it's going until the 31st.
[17:29.06]You download this project file here.
[17:34.28]You need to upload it.
[17:35.62]Get the game, obviously, if you want to join the contest.
[17:39.86]It's a build contest.
[17:42.58]And in this build contest, you are going to make Claruso's Dream Island house.
[17:53.31]He disappeared.
[17:53.97]Yep.
[17:55.49]Yeah, we've gone over this a bunch of times.
[17:57.13]I just want to make sure I show it at least once or twice more.
[18:01.42]So in this community, it's a build contest.
[18:04.80]You put your project to mod.io.
[18:06.64]They have a integration with mod.io.
[18:08.68]Follow the instructions.
[18:15.02]45 days to do it.
[18:16.72]There's a lot of entries.
[18:17.84]This is getting big.
[18:19.46]It is 45 days left.
[18:20.80]Damn, okay.
[18:21.88]But the real kicker, this is a build contest.
[18:23.74]They're giving away all this stuff for winners.
[18:26.88]But the real kicker is this thing.
[18:29.69]This is the grand prize.
[18:30.69]This is a PC.
[18:31.37]This is a custom PC with a custom case.
[18:33.63]That is the case.
[18:34.35]That is the real case of this computer.
[18:41.83]I want that so much.
[18:43.28]I do too.
[18:46.08]Trust me when I tell you, every time I look at this page, I go, I want this.
[18:57.43]And here is what's in it.
[19:03.97]What is the top, top, top graphics card now?
[19:10.61]Because I know NVIDIA, but I don't know... I know AMD's CPU chips, but I don't really know AMD's GPUs.
[19:22.69]4090.
[19:26.65]AMD has some monsters.
[19:31.25]I have AMD in here.
[19:32.71]I have... What's in here?
[19:33.53]6900?
[19:33.55]7900 for AMD's best right now?
[19:36.75]Yeah.
[19:42.13]The honestly, I've had AMD in this computer and it's been great.
[19:48.16]This thing is why it's it's been like three years.
[19:50.50]The thing still going really strong.
[19:51.60]It's really I feel like it's still pretty powerful.
[19:57.10]You have a 39.
[19:57.36]I have I have a 3090, but I have an AMD CPU.
[20:09.96]Can it run Security Breach Five Nights at Freddy's?
[20:14.70]I don't know, man.
[20:16.38]That's asking a lot.
[20:19.67]Yeah, there's other stuff they've given away too for the contest.
[20:22.31]Hey, you just saw that one on the left.
[20:27.43]Pretty slick.
[20:29.37]Yeah, let's get going.
[20:29.97]Just wanted to show it again because obviously this is a sponsored stream and the House Liberdevs have been very, very good to me.
[20:38.03]And I love this franchise.
[20:39.81]So I'm going to spend some time telling you about it.
[20:45.47]Alright, let's do it.
[20:46.51]Let's go for it.
[20:49.07]Again, thanks House Clipper for the sponsor.
[20:50.79]Let's go.
[20:51.57]Wow, I actually just wrote that.
[20:53.61]Okay, new property.
[20:57.25]What do I want to do?
[20:59.00]Okay, let's just start very small.
[21:02.86]I just want to like, okay, do I do coast, forest?
[21:06.40]I want to go town.
[21:07.04]I want to go town.
[21:07.60]I'm going to do small lot.
[21:10.39]A small test.
[21:11.19]I just want to get in here.
[21:16.28]When are you going to flip a house upside down?
[21:17.94]Uh.
[21:21.82]Good question.
[21:23.02]Alright, here we go.
[21:23.50]Welcome to sandbox mode.
[21:25.56]I actually know what all this is.
[21:27.92]Because look, see, this is what I was talking about in the Invitational when I was telling people this.
[21:32.78]Because when people were opening the game, and remember I was like, no shit!
[21:36.55]We had to restart the event.
[21:38.45]Because if you were not in this fucking mode, you were playing the game.
[21:45.35]Right?
[21:45.59]You weren't doing this.
[21:48.52]You actually were building walls.
[21:52.10]With like the build wall tool, not with this thing.
[21:57.34]So some people that were just in like the play mode and not doing the actual sandbox mode were... They were at a severe, unbelievable disadvantage.
[22:06.28]They were playing a different game.
[22:09.43]Alright, so let's go.
[22:10.99]How's this lot?
[22:12.91]We're going to get the grass the way that I like it.
[22:16.51]Edit land borders.
[22:19.41]Can I just encroach on my neighbor's?
[22:23.64]Hey, yeah, I just want to let you know.
[22:27.62]Yeah, I brought I talked to the city about this.
[22:30.08]It's fine.
[22:30.82]Oh shit, I can't imagine if I could just drag this thing into their living room.
[22:38.97]OK, land sculpting.
[22:40.51]Wait, I have an idea.
[22:42.07]Sometimes in for inspiration just hits and you have to take it.
[22:45.21]OK, inspiration just hit.
[22:46.68]I have to take it.
[22:48.68]Oh boy, OK.
[22:55.63]You just failed a bit.
[22:56.73]I'm not sure I did because inspiration just took a hold of me.
[23:01.85]I'm going to have this house be on like a 200 foot tall mountain in this neighborhood.
[23:08.18]OK, if this house is like 1000 feet in the air, does that increase or decrease this guy's house?
[23:16.36]What do you think?
[23:20.96]Do you think that decreases the value of this person's house?
[23:24.24]Yeah, decrease.
[23:28.40]Decrease because no one around here can get solar.
[23:32.90]That's so funny.
[23:37.18]Decrease.
[23:38.30]Decrease no sunlight.
[23:40.43]Should I try to block the sun from the whole neighborhood?
[23:45.21]They're gonna have to hold like a fucking town hall meeting about my house.
[23:51.13]I'm gonna cause like crop damage with this property.
[24:04.64]Wait, I think I can actually flatten it, can't I?
[24:06.34]Yes, I can.
[24:08.02]Ah, here we go.
[24:08.42]Intensity, height.
[24:09.84]Oh boy.
[24:16.31]What did I just do?
[24:19.19]That thing just opened its eyes at me.
[24:20.69]Did you see that?
[24:22.03]Oh my god, I've awoken the fucking... It's smiling at me.
[24:30.54]Oh, now I have to make like a fucking mountain demon.
[24:32.96]God damn it.
[24:33.86]Too much inspiration is too much.
[24:35.21]It's quiet inspiration.
[24:39.17]Sample height.
[24:42.75]Lance, hold on.
[24:43.51]Let me let me get this right.
[24:46.40]It's probably OK.
[24:47.24]You do this and then you flatten it, I think.
[24:51.18]Let's see.
[24:52.48]Oh, boy.
[25:03.04]Okay.
[25:27.76]Is there any build limits?
[25:29.66]I don't know what the limitations are for the different sizes of lots.
[25:33.35]But as you saw in Joel's house, I don't, I don't, it was ridiculous.
[25:39.95]Excuse me.
[25:40.45]How are you going to get up here?
[25:44.23]Alright, I don't want, don't go too overboard because I need to build a house on this.
[26:10.51]You need to build a bunch of scaffoldings on top of each other.
[26:18.99]Are you calling your real estate agent if you look out the window and you see this happening?
[26:26.74]Or do you assume this person has superpowers and you go out there and try to befriend this person to be their sidekick?
[26:31.71]Because there has to be, like, there's got to be a normal person's sidekick, right?
[26:35.57]It's going to be fucking me.
[26:38.04]The guy's up here alone.
[26:40.06]The dude's up here alone, by the way.
[26:41.32]Remember that.
[26:41.78]He's up here alone.
[26:43.84]There's no, like, superhero team with this guy.
[26:50.82]I am going to get a laptop and hold the laptop in my hands and walk over to this person and talk about, like, oh, I'm just, like, working on some tech stuff.
[27:04.24]What's going on over there, neighbor?
[27:05.28]I'm just working on some tech stuff.
[27:08.91]And then immediately, this guy's going to go, oh, really?
[27:13.95]Tech stuff.
[27:15.21]And he's going to want me to be his tech sidekick that calls in into his headset and helps him sneak into the tunnel system.
[27:33.58]By the way, this laptop could be one of those children's laptops.
[27:41.65]It doesn't even need to function.
[27:43.19]I just have to hold it in one arm while I'm addressing anybody with the other hand.
[27:46.17]I'll give you a leapfrog.
[27:57.10]It's just a content laptop.
[27:58.32]That's all it is.
[28:00.34]It's just an improvisational piece.
[28:05.79]Okay.
[28:06.17]Don't go... Let me square this up.
[28:08.23]I'm not going to be able to... How am I going to get up here?
[28:10.81]Wait.
[28:12.79]Do I do the Joel method?
[28:17.36]Hold on.
[28:17.76]Alright, square it off, square it off.
[28:19.66]I gotta square it off.
[28:20.82]Square it off.
[28:25.23]What is this one?
[28:25.89]No, this is the square it off, right?
[28:31.19]Oh shit, what did I just do?
[28:33.55]Good thing this is an undo.
[28:51.66]Uh-oh, he's going into a Joel inspiration period.
[29:05.43]This is ridiculous.
[29:12.37]I can't do this, right?
[29:13.79]Can I build my house on top of this other person's house?
[29:18.23]Oh my fucking god, you gotta be kidding me.
[29:23.48]Alright, we are learning right now.
[29:25.16]We're learning.
[29:25.92]Oh, shit.
[29:31.46]I can't.
[29:32.56]Because this is technically the land border.
[29:40.65]It's funny that some things do not care about the land border or the skybox.
[29:46.73]Alright, I got to round it out.
[29:49.39]We're just testing.
[29:52.17]Oops.
[29:52.87]Wait, what did I do?
[30:00.16]Oh, this is a square.
[30:01.32]It told me all along.
[30:03.87]I was wondering what this one meant.
[30:07.19]This is a square.
[30:08.17]I was like, what is this one for?
[30:10.17]Wait, wait, is it painting grass?
[30:21.19]Oh.
[30:29.40]Is that what the tool is?
[30:30.28]Can I put more?
[30:35.38]I can.
[30:35.82]Okay, you can just kind of fill it in.
[30:44.89]Wait a minute.
[30:48.37]Hey, bro.
[30:49.91]We're learning.
[30:50.41]I think it's like painting it.
[30:55.45]Like a... Hold on.
[30:59.53]Ah.
[31:01.63]Very interesting.
[31:03.77]So it matches whatever the highest height is.
[31:05.91]Yep, OK, so that's how you square it off.
[31:18.00]I can't wait to go down to the street level and look at this.
[31:25.69]Let's go like right off here.
[31:29.49]Yeah, this is fine.
[31:31.99]And do clean up on it later.
[31:32.89]Alright, now let's build the house.
[31:39.90]Oh shit, the height limit for like actual structures.
[31:45.12]Oh wait, am I just am I at the actual border here?
[31:54.78]Make it a pit in the middle.
[31:57.64]Can I do trees on top?
[31:58.66]Let's see.
[32:02.80]Okay, looks like there are building limitations and asset limitations.
[32:10.89]What am I talking about?
[32:12.05]Okay.
[32:12.97]So certain things can be built to infinity.
[32:19.05]Building material can only go about... I mean, this is still getting really high.
[32:27.46]At least on this lot, right?
[32:28.94]This is the small lot.
[32:30.40]I'm curious if the bigger lots have higher... Dude, what if I just make the house out of dirt?
[32:39.81]Is it possible?
[32:40.69]Can I just hollow this out and make the house in here?
[32:43.83]Don't even build walls?
[32:58.94]I definitely can.
[33:04.71]Sample height?
[33:05.43]First point.
[33:11.71]Okay, this is not removing though, but okay, now it will.
[33:14.75]Okay, here we go.
[33:15.49]Oh, is it removing it up there?
[33:22.74]No.
[33:29.75]Whoa.
[33:32.39]Oh, shit.
[33:33.09]Okay, hold on.
[33:35.15]This is absolutely doable.
[33:40.75]This is 100% doable.
[33:43.45]I don't know if my brain is big enough to do this, but it's doable.
[33:49.03]What about remove wall?
[33:51.56]Ah, shit.
[33:53.34]Land sculpting, maybe.
[33:54.96]Land holes makes the most sense.
[33:57.30]Oh!
[33:58.65]Oh my God, OK, hold on a second.
[34:03.94]Can I just do a little bit?
[34:10.22]Can I grab it here?
[34:14.38]It's a giant waterfall.
[34:15.50]Alright, so what is this?
[34:20.97]Does this go straight down now?
[34:26.93]It does.
[34:29.92]Okay, I think I know what the problem is.
[34:31.58]I have to pull this back.
[34:35.86]Because I'm at the border of the actual land.
[34:39.66]So I think we have to have at least enough room where I can physically walk in front of the house.
[34:48.66]Jesus.
[34:52.26]Okay, I may have made a very big mistake.
[35:09.72]Or maybe not.
[35:10.98]I may have just made the greatest thing ever.
[35:12.94]Okay.
[35:31.28]Yeah, this person is living across from a themed amphitheater.
[35:34.54]I should just make stadium seating and have a stage here.
[35:40.70]And put like musical instruments on it.
[35:46.08]Alright, hold on.
[35:46.72]Let me see what else I want to do with this.
[35:49.69]I need to get rid of this.
[35:50.41]How did I even make that?
[35:54.57]This might just have to stay here permanently.
[35:58.25]Because land painting, I guess... Can I paint this?
[36:05.78]Little bro is living in a diorama.
[36:09.87]It actually kind of looks cool, though.
[36:12.21]It looks like it's intentional, so I'm going to keep it.
[36:15.07]This all looks intentional.
[36:16.33]Alright, very important.
[36:24.12]Very important before all the court documents start filling my mailbox.
[36:29.74]Because there's no way I... There's no way if you have a place like this... There's no way I'm not getting sued by, like, at least a thousand people at the same time.
[36:36.56]You know what I mean?
[36:38.20]We're talking about, like, the water company.
[36:39.48]We're talking about, like, the ten neighbors that came together in the neighborhood.
[36:43.16]We're talking about the city, like, zoning group.
[36:46.96]We're talking about the... I mean, there are, like, at least five government agencies that are going to shut this down at the same time.
[36:52.28]And they might actually run into each other.
[36:55.26]So like, you know, the city kind of zoning group might like send the email at the same time that the class action of the neighborhood tries at the same time.
[37:04.79]And it's like, well, which one is going to happen?
[37:06.41]Because we can't do them all at the same time.
[37:09.41]It'll take 30 years to litigate this.
[37:13.51]So I think I'll be alright.
[37:18.96]The EPA, yeah, every agency is just got an email at the top of their inbox at the same time.
[37:28.31]Okay, let me make sure it looks clean over here.
[37:32.31]That's what we care about.
[37:33.83]I want clean edges, clean lines.
[37:36.03]Go like, gotta be a little bit closer.
[37:50.81]I'm so glad there is a noclip in this.
[38:04.66]I'm going to take my time with this, don't worry.
[38:05.96]Okay.
[38:09.22]This is how you really freak a neighbor out.
[38:15.04]There you go.
[38:18.31]Alright, while he's mowing the lawn... He finally... Then he runs your head over.
[38:28.73]Okay.
[38:31.43]Okay.
[38:33.26]It's all about hiding.
[38:34.52]It's all about hiding the imperfections.
[38:39.70]Ask any artist that you know.
[38:41.42]And say, hey.
[38:46.09]What are you doing?
[38:51.37]Okay, good.
[38:52.31]Good point.
[38:53.21]That's a great point that I just made.
[38:55.27]I'm very glad I made it.
[38:57.05]That was a good one.
[38:58.63]Good point.
[39:01.31]Hey, what are you doing?
[39:02.09]Yeah, that's okay.
[39:03.52]Whatever.
[39:03.98]We're going to keep going.
[39:06.54]I think you know what I meant by that, right?
[39:08.36]You guys got it.
[39:08.98]You know what I mean?
[39:14.14]But no one's going to look under here.
[39:15.76]It just this this black space just can't exist.
[39:19.78]Right?
[39:20.70]So it doesn't matter.
[39:22.12]It just like all that matters is that that this doesn't exist.
[39:25.02]They can't see the black over there.
[39:27.76]And this is going to get painted.
[39:28.56]This is this is a problem for me, though.
[39:32.06]They're going to remove... Wait.
[39:33.46]Yeah, this is a problem.
[39:37.24]I'm going to delete my neighbor's fence.
[39:43.21]Perfect.
[39:47.31]He's taking bong rips between each sentence.
[39:49.15]I got a coffee.
[39:55.01]This is your first creative, Viv.
[39:58.23]What's going on?
[39:59.85]Well, I'll tell you what's going on.
[40:01.63]I am playing around with the sandbox tools, and I'm actually trying to learn what they all do.
[40:05.95]And we're making... um... a... a attraction and amusement park, apparently.
[40:12.31]Oh, okay.
[40:12.89]That sounds good to me.
[40:18.72]This is my first stream.
[40:19.68]I'm very concerned.
[40:20.66]Okay.
[40:26.46]Everybody at the same time, working as intended.
[40:35.18]That's what you can expect here.
[40:36.14]Right, everybody?
[40:39.28]Is this too far in?
[40:47.62]I think it's okay.
[40:58.83]We have such a goofy community.
[41:06.10]Okay, what if I want to paint this?
[41:12.72]I'm leaving.
[41:17.69]Add a layer above it.
[41:19.49]You know, that's why I stream.
[41:22.41]So people can tell me things like that.
[41:23.79]I could have just done that, yeah.
[41:31.75]That's true, but it might stick out this side though as well.
[41:36.16]You need a toilet paper roll?
[41:38.46]We... Look, let me show you something.
[41:43.27]Look, I got a 3090.
[41:45.63]At some point... Because I know what all this stuff kind of does.
[41:48.17]This is just testing.
[42:23.68]Okay, if I put like a computer back here.
[42:27.46]If I just put a computer back here.
[42:29.44]And like a desk.
[42:40.03]Oh, it's like the content house.
[42:41.99]Oh, I love it.
[42:47.47]I don't know how much I can actually do.
[42:50.11]But...
[42:52.09]Now there's another agency that's- that's here.
[42:55.47]Now we gotta worry about all the animals.
[43:00.63]Alright, how long do you think it takes before, like, there's a thousand bears in this neighborhood?
[43:04.80]Oh boy, they're start- Are they getting mold- they're getting moldy!
[43:14.14]What?!
[43:19.94]Really?
[43:20.38]Is that really happening?
[43:23.37]They're all green.
[43:27.21]Were they like that when they land?
[43:28.31]Alright, again.
[43:35.74]Remember, I'm the guy with the laptop over here.
[43:41.34]I'm taking my barrels out.
[43:44.92]Just to make sure I can see what the fuck this guy's doing.
[43:46.92]And I look over and he's doing this.
[43:53.46]Okay, and all of a sudden he goes... Be blessed, my son.
[44:08.11]Oh shit, he's got a force field!
[44:09.61]Uh oh.
[44:19.48]Uh, I just heard my, I heard my graphics card just turn on loud.
[44:28.91]Oh.
[44:33.71]Oh no.
[44:35.77]How do I remove all this?
[44:39.61]I'm hitting Z a bunch.
[44:40.59]I don't know how far back I can go with undo.
[44:52.40]I actually think I have to restart.
[44:55.18]Because I don't think I can get rid of these.
[44:59.45]Sell this house.
[45:00.65]Can I sell this house?
[45:04.31]Okay.
[45:04.51]Well, we were just testing.
[45:05.51]We're testing.
[45:05.87]We're testing.
[45:06.33]Alright.
[45:06.59]Let me just put a bed here and save it.
[45:11.19]Dirt management.
[45:23.50]Visible trash.
[45:27.18]Oh, I think I crashed.
[45:28.58]Nope, I can remove it.
[45:30.51]This is how you do it.
[45:31.47]Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[45:32.81]Good, good, good.
[45:45.07]The orb, yeah.
[45:46.88]Cool.
[45:52.72]Yeah, you can make jobs in this game.
[45:59.47]Something that RT and Kiwa were showing in their house that they made.
[46:05.19]It was... You can create custom jobs.
[46:11.60]So you could make a, you know, clean up all the pizza quest.
[46:15.90]And send it to somebody.
[46:19.56]Alright, there's 11 slices of pizza somewhere.
[46:21.16]I don't know where.
[46:23.36]But I don't think I can get them.
[46:25.46]So they're just going to be embedded into the foundation of the house.
[46:31.87]Because I have no idea.
[46:44.20]On the other.
[46:44.58]Oh, here.
[46:44.84]Wait.
[46:45.04]On this.
[46:45.32]Yep.
[46:45.62]There.
[46:51.08]There's two slices of pizza left.
[46:53.62]Oh, there's only one slice of pizza left.
[46:55.66]Bro, which one of us is going to eat it?
[46:58.56]How many did you have?
[46:59.12]I had two.
[47:01.18]I had three.
[47:02.64]And then somebody over there had three, but they say they had two.
[47:05.50]You lying fuck.
[47:08.18]And then you take it.
[47:09.94]Don't do that.
[47:10.88]Be honest.
[47:12.93]And then we start counting, and we figure it out was you.
[47:14.87]Alright, let's do... I want to actually look at this stuff, because there's a lot of interesting things here.
[47:25.34]So if you didn't watch the invitational, and you didn't watch anything I was doing, uh, which, I mean, I was kind of facilitating, facilitating a lot, but this is every single surface in the entire game.
[47:37.53]And all of it can be changed.
[47:38.86]So what do, I want the ground here to be, I don't know, let's just take a look.
[47:44.18]Glossy wood.
[47:48.11]Stained beach.
[47:52.98]I see in the left here the rotation pattern.
[47:55.59]It just looks like it is one of the other.
[47:56.91]You can do cut pattern.
[47:59.05]Cool.
[48:05.54]I like that.
[48:09.26]Actually, I kind of like this.
[48:14.10]And you can do color and look at look at this.
[48:17.41]Just like every color.
[48:23.17]I don't know.
[48:23.78]Let's experiment.
[48:24.60]Why not?
[48:24.88]Let's see what it looks like.
[48:35.34]Oh, shit.
[48:35.83]I'm doing this wrong.
[48:36.97]It's sir.
[48:37.53]Okay.
[48:37.91]If you want to build a wall with that already on it, that's how you do that.
[48:44.25]I was on build walls.
[48:46.03]Also, I should do this too.
[48:48.66]Is it one?
[48:50.24]Two?
[48:50.74]Just for keybinds.
[48:54.01]12 now one because the hand tool 23.
[48:59.29]Or now maybe not a four for the transform tool.
[49:04.65]That's good.
[49:07.89]That's pretty much the basic tools.
[49:09.77]Alright, there you go.
[49:11.15]Here we go.
[49:11.77]Alright, let's try that again.
[49:12.57]I don't even know what it was.
[49:15.09]It was cool.
[49:17.95]Doesn't really work with the grass though.
[49:20.11]It kind of has to be wood.
[49:22.19]Driftwood.
[49:30.44]Build a mini Peter Griffin that's five blocks.
[49:33.54]I could.
[49:33.84]I mean, it would just be two green sticks on top of a sort of a larger white group of sticks.
[49:44.24]That's it.
[49:44.56]Do it now.
[49:46.98]Okay.
[49:47.40]Alright.
[49:47.96]Jeez.
[49:48.40]Alright.
[49:49.35]Okay.
[49:49.81]I'll make Peter Griffin.
[49:51.83]Okay.
[49:54.53]Okay.
[49:54.77]Fine.
[49:55.19]Jesus.
[49:56.25]Fine.
[49:56.35]Fine.
[50:03.22]Where's Peter Griffin Green?
[50:04.50]It's kind of like this, right?
[50:21.53]The lighter one or the darker one?
[50:36.59]Okay.
[50:38.61]That's way too wide, but... I only wanted... There we go.
[50:41.14]Hold on.
[50:43.62]There we go.
[51:18.60]Hey.
[51:44.32]Now we need.
[51:47.05]His head.
[51:47.53]His face.
[51:50.93]Peter is... Peter's a white dude.
[51:54.32]What's his... Let's see.
[51:55.88]This maybe?
[51:58.86]This?
[52:00.92]Like this.
[52:06.81]Hmm.
[52:07.97]It's probably close enough.
[52:16.41]That's a little too... Hey, all of you haters are all starting to kind of go, wait a minute.
[52:30.32]Okay, I see it.
[52:36.84]And then, uh, glasses?
[52:38.35]I can't really do glasses.
[52:46.14]I think we're just gonna have to go with this.
[52:52.69]Oops.
[53:00.40]Uh, okay.
[53:00.78]He's gonna have his hands on his hips.
[54:03.60]I wasted a lot of time on that, but there it was.
[54:06.45]Peter Griffin.
[54:11.83]There are probably so many of you that have played games like this, that have these kind of creative tools in it, who just saw what I did, and that gave you the inspiration to go, oh, okay, hold on.
[54:25.52]Don't erase him!
[54:27.60]Don't erase him!
[54:28.54]Don't erase him!
[54:30.22]Oh, shit.
[54:32.49]What am I going to do?
[54:46.27]There's an undo and redo in this game.
[54:47.85]Isn't that pretty pog?
[54:51.13]His head needs to be bigger.
[54:51.97]Not like I care, but it does.
[55:04.05]How did I screw that up?
[55:07.83]OK, well, I have to build around, uh, build around Peter now.
[55:14.89]We put Peter in his own room.
[55:16.37]He doesn't like.
[55:16.93]OK, hold on, let's do this.
[55:18.91]Hold on.
[55:20.19]Wait, inspiration is taking over.
[55:22.57]I need to paint the ground.
[55:25.36]No, let's do walls.
[55:27.20]Get the actual internals first.
[55:32.78]Alright, let me block out this house.
[55:35.17]Let's go bedroom, back corner.
[55:39.19]Peter has to be in the front door because I'm not moving him.
[55:44.52]Make sure you have a Lloyd room.
[55:45.52]Well, yeah, we'll do that after.
[55:48.62]This is just messing with the tools.
[55:49.88]I'm going to go to the big lot and make something.
[55:56.96]Well, here's the front door.
[56:17.97]Should it be closed?
[56:22.55]Uh-oh.
[56:26.58]Where's Lois?
[56:30.06]Oh, goddammit.
[56:32.26]I'm not making the whole family, guys.
[56:35.04]I'm not making the whole family, guys.
[56:38.51]I better get plus twos for that.
[56:52.56]It can be cleaned up.
[56:53.54]Let's just get it.
[56:54.02]Let's just get this up first.
[56:57.41]Oh.
[56:57.47]I think I like the dirt.
[57:09.58]I think I just kind of make it.
[57:11.30]I have to build around this.
[57:16.58]Let's go for.
[57:19.30]The floor.
[57:20.02]The floor is the most important part.
[57:21.56]I need to get that done first.
[57:27.59]European walnut?
[57:34.58]Maybe stone?
[57:35.84]Stone blocks?
[57:39.98]Big stone bricks?
[57:41.64]What do you think?
[57:48.77]I like the big stone bricks.
[57:55.95]On being services ago.
[58:04.35]Cool.
[58:18.16]OK.
[58:21.36]Just doing that makes this look way better.
[58:35.23]Again, it's all about illusion.
[58:39.73]If the person that is looking at this can't see it.
[58:43.43]Does not exist.
[58:45.91]There's no there's no error to see if they can't see the error.
[58:49.87]Thinking face.
[59:09.84]Just don't drop your keys down here.
[59:11.22]Because they're gone forever.
[59:12.60]I gotta get rid of this lip.
[59:27.81]Like, right at the edge of the property line.
[59:33.29]Oh, fuck.
[59:33.69]What was I just doing?
[59:34.27]Oh, I was painting.
[59:35.25]Right.
[59:46.06]Jesus looks like shit.
[59:49.35]Oops.
[59:58.60]There we go, OK.
[60:00.32]Now.
[60:02.22]Let's get.
[60:04.62]The sculpting tool.
[60:08.64]And.
[60:10.71]Radius intensity.
[60:15.34]I think it has to be on the ground.
[60:16.74]I don't think you can do it to walls.
[60:20.31]What is this, man?
[60:21.05]Hold on.
[60:22.09]Just wait.
[60:22.73]Okay, wall one, I'm going to make... This is the bedroom.
[60:32.97]Let's go like this.
[60:38.12]These ceilings are going to be enormous.
[60:40.94]I'm just realizing how tall the ceilings have to be.
[60:43.48]Or it could be multi... It could be a two or three story house.
[60:48.17]I feel like you have to do the stairs first.
[60:50.01]Am I crazy?
[60:54.23]You have to block out that first.
[60:56.51]You can't do that after the fact.
[61:00.40]Yes.
[61:00.76]Yes.
[61:00.98]Okay.
[61:01.40]Absolutely.
[61:02.40]Alright.
[61:02.60]So where...
[61:04.98]Where do I want to do that?
[61:06.62]Just I'm going to do two floors.
[61:08.22]Three floors is too much for me right now.
[61:09.42]Let's go from the corner.
[61:17.36]This is probably good enough, right?
[61:29.91]How did I build on two?
[61:31.35]What did I do here?
[61:36.42]Hey, remember what I just said?
[61:38.32]Hey.
[61:42.22]It doesn't exist if they can't see it.
[62:00.89]What about structural integrity?
[62:02.03]Yeah, I'm not getting graded on that right now.
[62:10.72]I can fix it.
[62:11.60]There's a tool, guys.
[62:12.92]There's a tool.
[62:13.72]Look.
[62:14.16]Don't worry.
[62:14.86]I got it.
[62:24.78]Ah, shit.
[62:26.76]It's okay.
[62:29.51]Now, the real question is, how do I get the stairs to go up?
[62:33.33]So, where do I want the stairs?
[62:35.65]I'm thinking front door.
[62:36.63]So, you go in the front door.
[62:42.51]The tool is the one in front of the keyboard.
[62:46.03]Well, that's interesting.
[62:47.71]Very interesting.
[62:50.95]Because I'm behind the keyboard.
[62:58.51]You're in front of the keyboard.
[63:12.58]Oh, shit.
[63:22.70]Thinking face.
[63:24.86]Take that back.
[63:34.71]Or would you be behind it because you technically can't see because it's upside down?
[63:39.75]Am I in front of the keyboard or am I behind it?
[63:45.44]I guess it could be either way.
[63:48.87]Well, that's a real.
[63:50.39]It's a real thinker.
[63:57.14]OK, where are the stairs going to go?
[64:03.78]You know, people I'm going to lean into this.
[64:05.99]People say when you go drive a car, what are you doing?
[64:10.51]You're gonna go do what?
[64:12.03]You're gonna go get... You're gonna go get behind... I'm gonna go get behind the wheel.
[64:18.22]I'll get in front of the wheel.
[64:26.64]Thinking.
[64:31.46]Okay.
[64:33.61]So, architectural elements.
[64:36.39]Roof.
[64:37.97]We'll put a roof on.
[64:46.65]What kind of roof?
[64:47.11]Hip?
[64:48.13]Let's do this one.
[65:10.06]This is just a huge crane.
[65:11.52]Okay, there were city laws that every single house in the entire city has to have a roof.
[65:17.69]So this is just made out of plywood and a crane just dropped it on top.
[65:22.57]I don't need a roof.
[65:25.11]There's already a roof.
[65:31.91]We have to deal with the stairs issue.
[65:33.93]Okay, beam.
[65:35.96]I think you can individually place stairs.
[65:48.71]Can I like individually place?
[65:51.05]We go like.
[65:55.57]No, it's just a plank.
[65:59.92]Stairs stairs.
[66:03.36]There's probably these ones.
[66:06.86]OK, wait wait wait beam.
[66:08.94]Beam beam beam beam.
[66:13.94]Stick these ones OK.
[66:14.86]Should I edit this at all?
[66:16.02]Alright base bottom full slanted.
[66:21.12]First step flat.
[66:22.26]Probably that.
[66:24.25]First step flat.
[66:25.35]Stair railing.
[66:27.15]Oh, Jesus.
[66:27.91]Okay.
[66:34.75]Cool.
[66:38.13]Uh... Okay.
[66:42.47]I think that has to... Okay, this is so... This is like 150 feet in the air.
[66:48.84]I'm going to have to have a stair case go up, stop, turn, go up, stop, turn, and go up to get up here.
[66:59.71]It's not an upstairs.
[67:00.75]This is going to be the upstairs.
[67:08.67]Okay.
[67:08.95]Let's just say this is the front door.
[67:11.64]Come in here.
[67:12.54]You got to build this first.
[67:13.36]Let's go right over here.
[67:16.40]Right there.
[67:17.02]Start it.
[67:26.38]Okay, it's three floors.
[67:27.10]I lied.
[67:27.44]Okay.
[67:34.72]So I need a floor here.
[67:35.50]Why are they so long?
[67:49.23]I mean, they have to go up.
[67:52.19]How many feet is this?
[67:56.09]I don't think this is that terrible.
[67:57.39]How tall is this?
[67:58.13]How tall is this ceiling here?
[68:07.30]12 feet?
[68:07.60]12 and a half feet?
[68:09.50]That's not bad.
[68:10.08]Alright, this is... Now you're up here.
[68:19.52]Now to get up to this one.
[68:21.56]This is going to have to be a four-floor house.
[68:25.03]Because you could do it... Like, watch.
[68:27.91]I could technically do this, right?
[68:31.75]But it's gotta be... It's gotta be... 20... 20 feet in the air?
[68:37.51]Okay, well...
[68:59.07]It's cool that you can do that.
[69:06.38]I'll keep it for now.
[69:08.82]But this is important.
[69:09.78]I need to do all this.
[69:11.04]Okay, here we go.
[69:14.40]Let's do the rest of this.
[69:15.16]Okay, this is in its unbelievable ugly phase.
[69:22.47]I'm just messing around with the tools.
[69:24.05]Come on.
[69:31.43]This, okay, this has to go all the way through and I'll just delete it from the other side.
[69:34.09]And they're not going to be all stone.
[69:37.35]Alright, architecture wise, you, okay, now let's do this.
[69:46.18]I actually, I need to enclose it, I think.
[69:48.86]Yeah, I'm enclosing it.
[69:54.22]We'll mess with it later.
[69:54.88]It's got to be enclosed.
[70:12.27]Looks like a billionaire's house.
[70:17.52]I don't want it to function at all.
[70:20.78]Just make it really fucking weird.
[70:27.99]Maybe the land tool.
[70:52.94]This one's going to be flush.
[71:07.60]What the hell is he doing?
[71:09.54]Testing the tools out.
[71:16.32]I kind of like where this is going.
[71:17.56]I like where this is going.
[71:20.37]I'm into it.
[71:26.89]We need a way to get out.
[71:28.92]No windows?
[71:33.88]Oh, this is the... Okay, this is the property line.
[71:36.28]I can't walk into the house.
[71:41.15]Well, I gotta make the windows.
[71:42.29]It's a process.
[71:43.93]You don't just snap your fingers and you have a house in front of you.
[71:54.78]I could measure how far this is across, but
[71:58.44]I'm not doing that.
[72:04.93]How tall is a door?
[72:05.65]7 feet, 8 foot, how tall is a door?
[72:13.84]Okay, well you can't leave unless you're flying.
[72:30.29]Hmm.
[72:30.87]Uh, external door, yeah.
[72:34.06]This is fine.
[72:34.72]Oh shit, I'm stuck on a wall.
[72:42.18]You built a prison and you only put Peter Griffin in it.
[72:47.20]Not.
[73:01.09]Honey.
[73:02.95]Honey.
[73:07.63]Jesus Christ.
[73:11.52]The fuck has gone up the goddamn other side of the street?
[73:16.76]What's he doing in there?
[73:21.72]Frank, stop looking out the window at the neighbor.
[73:24.24]What are you doing?
[73:24.75]I'm still...
[73:30.06]You just know that I have superpowers too.
[73:34.12]What's he building in there?
[73:35.21]What's he doing in there?
[73:41.47]Because every time it changes, right?
[73:43.17]Okay, hold on.
[73:54.93]I'm into this a bit.
[73:59.55]Ah, shit.
[74:00.02]It's too big.
[74:00.66]Hold on.
[74:01.58]I need... Wait a minute.
[74:02.24]Wait.
[74:02.48]Just wait.
[74:02.90]Everybody wait.
[74:12.25]What can I... I fucked up so bad making it right at the lip.
[74:21.01]Because I can't put anything in front of it.
[74:23.78]Oh, I'm doing this for a second.
[74:43.46]Honey.
[74:44.52]Honey.
[74:44.76]He's got seven doors now.
[74:47.36]What do you mean he's got seven doors?
[74:49.92]He's got seven fucking doors on his house.
[74:52.10]Those weren't there yesterday.
[74:56.22]He's probably a fucking warlock.
[74:59.39]You're thinking too much into it.
[75:00.69]He's probably just renovating.
[75:01.91]He's not fucking renovating.
[75:04.77]Nobody can build a door in less than that many doors in less than 12 hours, honey.
[75:08.67]You're fucking out of your mind.
[75:23.89]Don't worry.
[75:24.61]We'll be checking in on that guy later.
[75:28.16]What does he have to say about the midway point of the house?
[75:32.04]How does he feel about the finished product?
[75:34.60]Check it out soon.
[75:37.04]Okay.
[75:43.13]These doors are modern windows.
[75:49.28]Alright, so... Let's go... This.
[75:57.10]Oh, Jesus.
[75:58.14]I- Didn't I say- This is just what happens.
[76:01.57]I just wanted to build a little house to test with the tools and what- How the fuck did this happen?
[76:09.99]How did this happen?
[76:10.73]I wanted to make a 40x40 house.
[76:13.61]Why did this happen?
[76:17.76]You're like a mobile ad.
[76:18.64]I want to buy the game to make sure I do it right.
[76:24.76]Yeah, well, hey, you're going to get in and you're going to test the tools too.
[76:28.70]You don't just get into a game and know how to... what the staircase tools dimensions are.
[76:34.25]I'm going to see what this stuff even does.
[76:44.15]Bro?
[76:49.68]Okay, let's start with this.
[76:52.24]I want to finish this.
[76:52.84]Okay.
[77:09.04]I'll fix it.
[77:10.34]Oh, shit.
[77:11.26]You can't go up the stairs.
[77:14.82]How do stairs work?
[77:16.00]Right, okay.
[77:27.74]Almost.
[77:40.46]You made working stairs.
[77:42.78]Oops.
[77:50.95]You're going to scrape your head every time.
[77:54.98]That is so cool that you can actually do this though.
[77:56.90]I remember in the first game that was one of the things I wanted to do so bad was be able to actually just make a staircase or remove a staircase.
[78:06.97]Being able to do it wherever you want and whenever you want is awesome.
[78:15.04]I feel like the ceilings are very low.
[78:19.82]Are they low?
[78:22.08]Or is he just huge?
[78:24.04]I think he's just gigantic, yeah.
[78:28.71]Yeah, this is not... It's not going to be these colors.
[78:30.63]It's not going to be these floors.
[78:31.73]We're just getting the foundation.
[78:34.61]So, that looks good.
[78:36.55]I'll do the detail work later.
[78:37.55]Let's just get the actual foundation of the house.
[78:54.90]Fine.
[78:55.44]Yep.
[78:58.80]Why does Peter not have hair?
[79:01.88]Good question.
[79:16.27]Nice.
[79:28.24]Good.
[79:31.56]Cool.
[79:33.64]Okay.
[79:34.38]So that's how you do stairs.
[79:39.46]Very cool.
[79:40.70]Very fun.
[79:43.58]Let's start with the bottom floor.
[79:44.89]Fix this too.
[80:01.67]Alright, room number one.
[80:03.01]This is gonna be the... Is it a wizard's tower?
[80:08.13]Your 90 minutes is up.
[80:12.79]Hey, well... I was very casually playing.
[80:17.31]Hey, hey, in the first like 30 minutes of the stream we were talking about random shit.
[80:25.36]No, I'm not going to go do that guy.
[80:26.54]I wanted to.
[80:27.08]I wanted to go do that guy in the house.
[80:43.93]The door's open.
[80:45.73]Honey, the door's open.
[80:48.43]Who cares if the door is open?
[80:49.71]You don't understand.
[80:50.29]I can see him in there.
[80:52.35]Look, he's got... He's got a white shirt.
[80:59.20]Man, it just seems today.
[81:02.10]You ever notice that all you see, honey, on TV these days is just violence and sex?
[81:10.34]What happened to those values we had?
[81:12.46]Now we got people like this moving in across the street being fucking weird.
[81:16.91]We used to rely on those fucking values, honey.
[81:20.95]Lucky I'm still around.
[81:22.41]Me.
[81:23.45]To make sure this neighborhood doesn't fall apart.
[81:26.17]Lucky there's me, a guy.
[81:29.19]What a nice family.
[81:33.29]Fucking weirdos.
[81:51.64]He's still doing it?
[81:52.36]I promise you- I promise you will not see that bit again.
[81:59.71]More than seven or eight more times.
[82:01.07]Okay.
[82:06.79]Room.
[82:09.33]Room one.
[82:11.51]Uh, I don't know.
[82:12.09]Let's go like this.
[82:16.38]Six times confirmed.
[82:18.08]These ceilings are fucking huge, aren't they?
[82:20.90]No.
[82:21.98]My scale is so wrong because his head is almost at the ceiling.
[82:27.14]How tall is this character?
[82:30.09]No, this is accurate.
[82:31.37]It's just, this is fucking me up.
[82:33.65]If this wasn't here, this is fine.
[82:54.46]Ooh, that's kind of cool looking.
[82:56.30]I'm going to do the sculpting on this, too.
[83:03.77]I need temporary doors.
[83:04.99]These are just temporary.
[83:12.26]Okay.
[83:14.34]I need to remove the wall, don't I?
[83:17.64]I think you can place... Oh, that's exterior.
[83:19.88]Okay, I need an interior door.
[83:20.74]Can I not place it?
[83:35.66]I think on some walls you can just put it right in.
[83:37.62]I think I have to do this.
[83:42.78]That might go there.
[84:07.44]Can I not place doors in this wall?
[84:09.96]Needs to be one more row.
[84:12.66]Oh, fuck.
[84:14.38]Look at this.
[84:15.21]How come it's not working?
[84:16.01]Look, it fits perfectly.
[84:17.89]I don't understand.
[84:18.75]Oh.
[84:21.79]Is that it?
[84:30.10]One more?
[84:33.40]No, one more.
[84:36.31]I need to remove wall on a hotkey.
[84:39.09]Will do 5.
[84:39.65]It's better, so I don't have to keep going to the menu.
[84:50.91]Still doesn't work.
[84:57.52]Is that kind of?
[84:58.20]Am I looking at the wrong doors?
[84:59.76]Exterior, exit door, door.
[85:02.96]Or frame maybe?
[85:07.27]Is it because it's stone?
[85:08.07]No.
[85:21.00]Snap to grid.
[85:22.00]Precise placement.
[85:25.36]It's the terrain.
[85:26.06]Is it?
[85:41.43]Because I'm pretty sure you can just usually just go on.
[85:55.13]You're building with exterior walls.
[85:59.69]Small test.
[86:04.61]This is the picture that was taken.
[86:14.98]The neighbor took that picture.
[86:18.86]I think it is because this is... Oh, because this is... This is an exterior wall.
[86:26.94]Wait, let's just confirm that.
[86:29.80]No, I think it was just a bug.
[86:32.15]Just a bug.
[86:39.21]Okay, that is that.
[86:42.61]We have a big living room over here.
[86:46.10]This is the bathroom and kitchen.
[86:47.18]Okay, this is the bathroom.
[87:01.12]No, this is the bedroom.
[87:02.86]Oh, you got nature in your bedroom.
[87:04.98]Check it out.
[87:05.62]Watch this.
[87:11.79]So many people that were like making this is like a bunch of you in Discord calls right now, like laughing and making fun of me and shit like shitty.
[87:18.45]This is.
[87:19.53]Yeah, he sucks, dude.
[87:20.61]It's just fucking dumb.
[87:22.31]And then you just and then I did this and you just saw like this part where it's like the curved here and it's like the nature and like somebody in that call just smashed their fucking hands on their desk and they're like, God damn it.
[87:31.92]Like, it's good.
[87:32.70]No, he sucks.
[87:35.42]Fuck no.
[87:49.34]Cool.
[87:49.70]Okay.
[87:50.40]This is temporary.
[87:52.56]What else do I want in my nature bedroom?
[87:58.06]What's happening in nature?
[87:58.84]What happened?
[88:04.13]Desk.
[88:11.37]A big mushroom?
[88:22.78]uh wait uh damn it that's gonna be a magical key
[88:52.75]Alright, I'll figure that out later.
[89:00.47]Oh, here's nature decor.
[89:19.26]Yeah, this is my morning coffee.
[89:21.59]I get up and I just pick out one of these and eat one.
[89:23.35]Dude, this is where the TV is going.
[89:58.37]Shit ah wait I can float it though.
[90:17.88]I'm pretty sure I can float it watch ready If I go to transform tool and I do fishing rod I
[90:29.23]Yep.
[90:32.47]It's my tree TV.
[90:51.04]What a wonderful morning that was.
[90:57.08]The start of a horror movie.
[91:01.02]Okay.
[91:03.06]I want... Is it going to be like a bureau?
[91:04.84]Like a dresser?
[91:05.94]This stone is pissing me off.
[91:07.88]I know it's pissing you all off.
[91:10.32]Because it's pissing me off.
[91:12.34]It's too much stone.
[91:14.24]I need a good bedroom floor.
[91:24.53]What should I do?
[91:32.59]Floor.
[91:33.51]That has to make sense.
[91:35.24]Or I'll scream.
[91:37.18]Moldy wood.
[91:37.90]That actually might make sense.
[91:41.18]Old stone.
[91:41.82]This looks a little nicer than just kind of cinder blocks.
[91:48.22]Moldy wood.
[91:49.80]Cut pattern.
[91:50.44]Let's keep it default.
[91:54.04]Darken it a little.
[92:00.38]Let's check.
[92:00.78]Let's try this.
[92:16.77]Uh, with light in here, it might look good.
[92:20.89]Swamp house.
[92:24.13]What the fuck was that?
[92:25.12]Oh, it was a... Okay, that freaked me out.
[92:27.82]Black mold house.
[92:36.98]They're already smashing stuff.
[92:38.22]Okay.
[92:39.66]Uh, TV channel.
[92:43.82]Modern aliens.
[92:51.37]Oh, I think I have to.
[92:55.59]No, I want modern aliens.
[93:06.61]Oh, there's modern aliens.
[93:07.45]Hold on.
[93:14.13]Let's watch this for a second.
[93:36.91]I wonder how long these are.
[93:37.97]Top secret.
[94:05.29]Let's go.
[94:10.35]OK, let's delete these.
[94:21.14]I'm just having fun, just kind of chill and this is I love this.
[94:23.64]This is one of those therapeutic kind of games that helps the first one was the same way.
[94:35.98]I could just melt time just walking around, picking up stuff and looking at things.
[94:40.98]All you do is chill.
[94:42.16]Yeah.
[94:43.54]Hey.
[94:44.32]Okay, goals, right?
[94:46.77]That's not true at all.
[94:51.73]But my life is fucking a tornado of stuff happening every day.
[94:56.79]Alright, let's get into new.
[95:09.51]I'm thinking, let's go.
[95:10.73]I don't want to hit the stairs, so let's go like this.
[95:16.53]I can't see, but it's okay.
[95:18.85]Shit, I thought I had it.
[95:22.97]Do I want that to be all the way across, though?
[95:24.61]I feel like that looks weird.
[95:26.53]I need space in the middle, maybe?
[95:27.97]I don't know.
[95:28.45]Let's see.
[95:54.72]Make a closet here or something.
[95:57.09]OK, we're gonna do a closet.
[95:58.05]The closet under the stairs.
[96:01.84]What the hell happened here?
[96:08.37]I'll fix it with the tarantula.
[96:29.50]Yeah, I can fix this.
[96:34.75]Door.
[96:40.07]Put one there.
[96:40.59]It's just temporary.
[96:45.54]Kind of a huge closet.
[96:48.10]This could be like another bedroom.
[96:49.28]I don't know.
[96:55.51]What does Peter's presence add to this build?
[96:58.25]Absolutely nothing.
[97:00.15]People wanted me to make Peter Griffin because we were testing out the build paint tool thing.
[97:05.17]So I did.
[97:05.47]It's supposed to be Peter Griffin?
[97:21.00]I mean, a very rushed version of him.
[97:28.09]I want one of these rooms to be like a jump scare.
[97:30.15]You open it.
[97:30.55]It just scares the shit out of you.
[97:36.20]That would be this one.
[97:42.53]I want to hold on.
[97:43.07]I want to do something.
[97:43.91]Let's do this.
[97:44.35]Ready?
[97:58.01]I love that you can actually do this now.
[97:59.51]Because before you were just limited to needing to use the actual blueprint of the house.
[98:12.35]I can do dumb shit like this now.
[98:49.59]It's just turning into a maze.
[98:55.05]That's so funny.
[99:00.33]Endless trap.
[99:03.00]There, could you walk through?
[99:03.88]Oops.
[99:04.92]Oops.
[99:05.96]Oops.
[99:06.70]Oops.
[99:09.34]With proper lighting and cues and... You could make a haunted house.
[99:22.15]Okay, this has to be terrifying.
[99:35.40]Does this be candy?
[99:36.18]There's this trail of candy everywhere.
[99:41.77]You're making a Lethal Company level.
[99:47.91]Should I just put doors everywhere?
[99:49.31]And just walk around, decorate it, and hum pure imagination?
[99:55.37]There is no lie, I know.
[99:58.21]You come here with pure imagination.
[100:01.09]Okay.
[100:15.52]Okay.
[100:21.87]Let's make this a fun room.
[100:24.03]Make it the paint.
[100:31.18]Painting.
[100:31.98]Hmm.
[100:35.66]Something wacky.
[100:36.26]I want something colorful on the walls.
[100:45.76]Gold?
[100:46.65]One of these rooms should be gold.
[100:48.11]Oh, yeah. 100%.
[100:53.22]With big bright lights.
[101:00.67]Big chocolate factory.
[101:04.89]Yeah, I need lights.
[101:07.49]Let's make this completely gold.
[101:15.67]If you want to view Paradise, that was bad.
[101:26.74]Simply look around and view it.
[101:53.83]Can you hear this?
[101:58.74]Singing so fucking loud, he has loudspeakers.
[102:00.88]What is that song?
[102:04.68]I'm going over there.
[102:16.20]Oh, Jesus.
[102:16.86]Okay, let's... I want to make... Let's do this one.
[102:19.24]Let's do lights.
[102:21.99]lamp or I wonder what how much you can actually do because people had a lot of questions about the lighting and I didn't really have answers I think uh snuffy at one point was like hey can you change the color of the lamps and I was like I don't that's a good question I don't know with the fishing rod tool you can kind of float stuff around you can different bulbs I wonder
[102:51.12]You only have four neighbor bits left.
[102:53.04]Better make them count.
[102:55.96]It's true.
[103:00.12]Oh, this is kind of I like that.
[103:05.17]Gold or.
[103:10.39]Metal.
[103:15.53]Alright, temperature.
[103:19.53]This is the heat, the temperature, the light.
[103:22.36]Okay, low is warm, right?
[103:24.38]Or high is cool.
[103:26.34]Low is no.
[103:27.00]Do I have that wrong?
[103:32.90]High is cool, isn't it?
[103:34.74]No, low is cool.
[103:37.72]I'm curious what it looks like.
[103:38.80]I'm going to float it.
[103:44.59]Can I float it?
[103:45.21]Let's find out.
[103:50.71]Yeah I can, okay.
[103:59.63]That's so fucking cool that you can do that.
[104:02.31]That's so cool.
[104:23.24]I didn't freeze it.
[104:24.02]I clicked.
[104:28.85]What if I put, like, ten of these in this room?
[104:30.55]Would it reflect all the light?
[104:32.79]Probably.
[104:36.91]Whoa.
[104:43.60]Creepy.
[104:50.23]Should I make like a spider eye with it?
[104:51.91]Yeah.
[104:52.95]That's what I'm doing.
[104:53.61]Let's duplicate it.
[104:58.34]I think it's this, right?
[105:03.72]Move.
[105:05.89]Resize.
[105:07.05]Yeah, you can scale stuff.
[105:11.29]No, it's the hand tool.
[105:11.97]Okay, duplicate.
[105:12.91]Duplicate.
[105:20.16]I can't duplicate it like here.
[105:21.18]Maybe I can.
[105:23.44]Come on, let me do it right.
[105:24.76]Move.
[105:25.00]I think you can only duplicate and then drag it over.
[105:47.73]Cool.
[105:50.02]You could spend so much time just fucking doing this like what I'm doing right now.
[106:02.54]It has every access to that's cool.
[106:15.59]We put like three of them out and then I'll move him around.
[106:41.57]I'll get him in the right spot.
[106:45.43]You can make a really scary room though.
[106:47.70]Do this have like two of these big groups and monster face?
[107:02.36]And these are like eyeballs.
[107:09.22]I'm going to delete this one.
[107:10.24]Let's not overwhelm ourselves.
[107:12.14]I feel like I'm doing that to myself right now.
[107:18.20]Oops.
[107:25.77]Let's see.
[107:27.49]Willy Wonka Saw Factory.
[108:08.77]Creepy.
[108:28.97]Like the god room.
[108:34.93]I can definitely see this is once you know everything and learn where everything is and how everything works.
[108:43.68]I cannot wait to see this shit that people make.
[108:45.34]It's going to be such ridiculous stuff.
[109:00.43]Angel room.
[109:02.03]Maybe one light.
[109:02.69]Is there a long strip light?
[109:05.21]I wonder.
[109:05.59]Let's find out.
[109:13.09]What?
[109:14.06]Floor transition strip bits and bobs?
[109:19.76]You can.
[109:20.44]I think I... Can you do that?
[109:24.38]Is this light?
[109:26.48]Oh, shit.
[109:26.78]I thought it was a strip light.
[109:38.17]led maybe yeah that's a good idea I just I just kind of that that just worked for me I don't know why
[110:07.61]Hmm.
[110:12.34]Maybe just light.
[110:20.40]It's kind of a line of light.
[110:25.26]Post light.
[110:25.82]Highlighter pen.
[110:32.96]I'm not going to type anything in.
[110:37.07]There's a whole bunch of new menus over here.
[110:39.44]Sandbox only.
[110:41.78]I wonder what's in here.
[110:46.02]Oh my god.
[110:47.12]I could spend so long doing this.
[110:52.46]I want to make an unboxing quest for somebody and give it to them and it's just like a hundred toilets in the fucking box.
[111:03.42]You could spend days doing this shit.
[111:11.38]Doing another invitation or something where I actually make quests for people and have them do them on streams.
[111:17.44]There's a lot of somebody said earlier to be fun to do, maybe like a community thing where go through people like houses that people made in the community.
[111:26.33]I like it, but the only reason why I don't is because the sheer amount of submissions I think would just be impossible.
[111:33.29]It would have to be some really, really heavy, heavy white-listed group of people.
[111:38.21]Because I don't know if I and my mods have the bandwidth, especially now that I'm slowed down, to go through thousands of submissions.
[111:49.58]But still a cool thought, being able to make quests.
[111:51.76]You guys make jobs or quests that I do.
[111:55.52]That's really cool.
[111:56.24]I don't know.
[112:00.80]We'll see.
[112:01.02]I'm not opposed to it.
[112:11.70]What else is in this room?
[112:12.56]There's got to be more here.
[112:13.36]I'm in here right now.
[112:14.70]I'm in here.
[112:18.85]Hammer.
[112:20.25]Tire.
[112:23.93]Crates.
[112:24.37]I don't know.
[112:27.93]Why don't it be like the construction room?
[112:36.66]I heard of my door cube a long time ago.
[112:38.36]Well, that business went under.
[112:46.69]Bathroom fixtures.
[112:47.55]What new bathroom stuff is even in the game?
[112:49.49]Bathtub.
[112:58.61]I mean, what if I do this?
[113:00.41]Let's see what it looks like.
[113:08.07]Hmm.
[113:14.52]Move this shit.
[113:16.47]No, I like where that is.
[113:21.79]We'll come back to this one.
[113:28.24]Do a watermelon room now?
[113:30.92]Good idea.
[113:37.88]The second room will be the watermelon room.
[113:41.81]Let's get good watermelon paper, like wallpaper.
[113:53.89]This is kind of watermelon-y.
[113:55.25]Alright, color one.
[114:09.06]Color palette, drab, faded, rich, pure.
[114:13.14]I feel like it's got to be pure.
[114:25.96]That's kind of already kind of good, isn't it?
[114:28.44]It's already kind of good.
[114:46.23]Oh, I just bought it.
[114:47.23]I didn't make... Oh, I'm in like the buy menu.
[114:49.85]Okay, that's my bad.
[114:50.97]Alright, where was it?
[114:52.53]It was patterns and down here.
[114:58.01]There it is.
[114:59.61]Okay, there we go.
[115:06.54]What's a watermelon look like?
[115:09.46]That's close.
[115:15.26]Let's do... I need like red.
[115:17.06]Yeah.
[115:19.26]There we go.
[115:19.74]Look at that.
[115:29.72]Let's see.
[115:30.16]Let's see how wild this looks.
[115:31.70]This is going to make me puke.
[115:40.29]That's a little much.
[115:52.33]Let's do maybe green on this wall.
[115:59.26]Let's see.
[115:59.72]How awful does this look?
[116:17.86]Can you add another swing?
[116:19.54]Okay.
[116:22.32]Uh, no.
[116:24.84]Nope.
[116:29.14]OK, then there's going to be a table over here.
[116:38.46]Oh, this one's good, no.
[116:44.39]Glass table glass table seems kind of good.
[116:47.25]This thing is very small.
[117:00.54]Kids pool?
[117:00.96]What is that for?
[117:03.24]Do a pose in front of the green screen.
[117:12.94]This is funny.
[117:13.64]I'm setting up my little laboratory rooms.
[117:25.24]Yeah, I know maybe people thought I was gonna make, like, the fuckin' saw house today, but... I gotta learn.
[117:32.70]We're learning today.
[117:44.87]Is this not the saw house?
[117:47.51]I mean, it... it could be.
[117:49.44]Who knows?
[117:52.24]You just need two thousand watermelons.
[117:58.93]I don't know.
[117:59.27]I don't... I'm also a proponent of... I don't know if you go for that.
[118:02.45]I don't know if you do that again.
[118:03.33]Yeah, will it be funny the second time?
[118:08.17]I don't know.
[118:09.04]Not so sure.
[118:19.46]Can I make this green?
[118:29.62]Cork plastic.
[118:35.89]I can make the table green.
[118:37.31]Should the table be red?
[118:42.86]Green.
[118:43.84]No, red.
[118:44.30]We need more red.
[119:00.22]Too much red?
[119:01.10]The doors don't match?
[119:22.96]Oh, they'll be edited later.
[119:24.10]I'm really just playing around, honestly.
[119:43.92]What's the camera for?
[119:44.70]Do you like watermelon?
[119:47.00]I do.
[119:47.44]I like watermelon juice.
[119:52.55]Watermelon juice is awesome.
[119:54.69]I know it's just sugar water.
[119:57.09]That's all it is.
[119:58.13]But it's great.
[119:58.67]Alright, let's get a better door here.
[120:01.86]Something that's a little more whimsical, please.
[120:09.14]No.
[120:09.98]No.
[120:10.12]No.
[120:14.45]I just think of poke every time I see a garage door now.
[120:23.86]Watermelon garage door.
[120:27.46]Make a trap door.
[120:29.11]That's a good idea.
[120:31.47]You should be able to fall into the watermelon room.
[120:46.09]And then you gotta get out of the watermelon room.
[120:48.65]By going down.
[120:49.89]Again.
[120:50.23]Like through like a- kind of like a- like a trap door.
[120:53.77]And then that brings you down here and you have to go up and around like a staircase.
[120:56.11]Are we going a little too far right now?
[120:57.97]I have to learn how to play the game.
[120:59.21]Hold on.
[121:10.82]Sweet rind room.
[121:14.32]What does this even look like from the outside?
[121:20.30]It's like a fucking Counter-Strike Trouble in Terrorist Town map.
[121:24.78]I feel like I'm playing Jailbreak.
[121:37.63]Wait, where's the door to get in there?
[121:39.03]Oh, wait, hold on.
[121:39.85]I don't even know what's even... Oh, wait, I made the... How do I get in this room?
[121:45.55]I took the... This is the watermelon room.
[121:47.33]I took the doorway.
[121:54.07]Alright, let's make this interesting looking.
[122:00.59]Glossy plastic.
[122:06.86]Okay.
[122:08.04]What color should this door be?
[122:11.08]GM underscore JermaCraft.
[122:16.00]Yeah, it's going to be a golden door for this next one.
[122:20.34]Yeah, this would be the watermelon.
[122:21.70]No, I don't want there to be a watermelon door.
[122:28.60]This door is going to be gold.
[122:29.84]Because when you go in here... Oh, fuck.
[122:32.26]I wish I could flip this room.
[122:36.02]No, we'll make another room that you fall into.
[122:38.23]Doesn't have to be watermelon.
[122:38.93]When was the last time you even played Gmod?
[122:43.11]It's been a long time.
[122:45.47]Except probably 10 years.
[122:48.31]Honestly, the last video that popped up on my main channel is probably the last time I played it.
[122:55.22]I gotta think about this part.
[123:01.58]Please make Peter a friend.
[123:04.06]Maybe later.
[123:11.10]Yeah, this is too simple.
[123:12.33]This is too easy.
[123:13.17]Well, maybe that one should be.
[123:15.75]And then this one is when you go through and you fall.
[123:19.65]I like that.
[123:28.31]What do you fall into?
[123:30.09]Wham, right here.
[123:47.59]Find out.
[124:00.00]Oops, there we go.
[124:05.39]I want to be just as wide as that.
[124:10.39]So you fall and you actually just trapped in like a fun house room.
[124:31.82]There is no life I know.
[124:54.44]It should be longer than that.
[124:56.76]This should fall for like at least five seconds.
[125:06.74]Fill it with pizza.
[125:09.98]Yeah, there has to be places where you just fail and you can't do it.
[125:13.30]Because if you do play, then there has to be places where you just fail.
[125:18.72]It's over.
[125:19.26]Kind of like the same concept that Ster and Poke did.
[125:23.44]Or it's just, I'm sorry, you lost.
[125:26.00]Choose your own adventure house.
[125:34.04]Neverhood drain?
[125:35.18]Oh, yeah.
[125:37.30]How far down?
[125:37.76]Okay, I can only go down so far.
[125:39.87]That's okay though.
[125:42.49]That's far enough.
[125:59.80]Because now you're down here.
[126:03.58]And maybe you have to wrap back around and go up and around.
[126:06.04]Or you go this way.
[126:08.65]This is going to look I mean, I could actually try to spend time on this and do it.
[126:27.11]I'm flying, OK?
[126:27.69]I was like, why am I not falling?
[126:35.17]Yeah, this should be all black.
[126:38.10]Absolutely.
[126:41.10]Without a doubt.
[126:54.21]Will be glossy.
[126:55.11]That be glossy, right?
[127:11.55]Oh, that's scary.
[127:20.82]There should be like one little lamp right here.
[127:27.73]Also.
[127:29.79]The ground is going to be this too.
[127:32.53]And so is this ground.
[127:33.33]So you're going to think you're like walking on nothing.
[127:37.22]Ooh, creepy.
[127:43.48]Let me go to the build tool.
[127:49.73]Iron, there we go.
[127:50.13]Let's see.
[127:51.19]Okay, there's got to be at least three or four points where you can fix yourself.
[128:05.64]It's pretty far down.
[128:20.49]Will there be lights all the way down?
[128:21.79]That'd be kind of cool.
[128:34.18]Only darkness?
[128:42.66]That's kind of terrifying, honestly.
[128:47.37]There should be something that looks really scary that you think you're gonna hit, but you don't.
[128:51.45]Spikes.
[128:52.49]There's gonna be a glass pane here.
[128:56.26]Under the glass pane is gonna be spikes.
[128:58.88]And whether that's an image of just spikes pointing up... It's like, oh my god!
[129:03.26]We're gonna hit the fucking spikes!
[129:05.70]No.
[129:27.18]You have to hide everything too.
[129:28.34]Okay.
[129:53.97]I just got disoriented.
[129:58.39]This is a little too tall.
[129:59.41]A little bit.
[130:03.48]A little more.
[130:04.66]Good.
[130:17.01]I'm only here for the drops.
[130:20.35]Get them.
[130:23.35]Load up on them.
[130:23.93]Are drops enabled here?
[130:26.60]Did I enable them?
[130:34.88]Hey, hey, hey.
[130:35.80]That's what they all say.
[130:39.70]See you in a few months when you're asking about where the Willy Wonka house is.
[130:47.45]I think that person got the drop and left.
[130:48.55]I don't have to be too crazy about detail right now.
[131:00.25]I just need to get it there.
[131:05.20]Cool, okay.
[131:10.48]There's so much to do!
[131:12.49]What do I want to do first?
[131:26.92]The ground has to be green as well.
[131:34.19]Should the ground be red?
[131:34.87]Let's see what that looks like.
[131:46.46]Weird.
[131:47.62]Kind of a headache room, honestly.
[131:54.42]The top should maybe be red.
[132:00.29]Yeah, that's much better.
[132:01.93]Which is the ground?
[132:02.45]The ground should be green?
[132:03.51]Green or red?
[132:08.49]Was there a theme for this house?
[132:10.59]No.
[132:11.69]I think the theme is just trying to learn how to play sandbox mode.
[132:18.66]It's developing into a kind of a choose your own adventure fun house Willy Wonka death trap house.
[132:26.82]Red for the ground too.
[132:29.95]You should do black on the floor.
[132:30.91]Let me see what that looks like.
[132:37.57]That's not a bad idea.
[132:38.92]It's a good idea.
[132:41.70]Yeah.
[132:46.30]This floor should be black too to make it so people don't look and see.
[132:50.14]The lip.
[132:55.77]You can kind of see it, but not really.
[133:05.86]What is right through here?
[133:12.99]I don't even know where I am.
[133:14.21]Where am I?
[133:14.69]I don't even know how to get out of my own house.
[133:21.47]What?
[133:21.77]Where is this?
[133:26.18]I don't understand.
[133:26.86]Honey.
[133:29.28]Honey, look, honey.
[133:29.94]He's fucking flying.
[133:33.94]That doesn't count as one.
[133:46.34]It's gonna take like a hundred hours to make this.
[133:55.03]This should be the starting point, I think.
[133:57.77]Because if this is the starting point, then... It could be a nice... Oh, look.
[134:01.57]Hey, welcome.
[134:02.15]Welcome to the game.
[134:03.05]Welcome to the challenge.
[134:06.85]Rest up.
[134:07.37]You're gonna need it.
[134:08.89]And you go through this door here, which leads you to what?
[134:11.49]What is right here?
[134:13.28]Perfect.
[134:14.14]Actually perfect.
[134:14.88]Because then this...
[134:17.63]Nope, not perfect.
[134:22.89]You should go through this door.
[134:25.98]Which leads you to here.
[134:26.72]Yeah, there shouldn't be way to get through there.
[134:32.50]So I'm kind of not where I'm working.
[134:35.18]Backwards instead of forwards, but that's OK.
[134:45.41]This doesn't need to exist anymore.
[134:46.59]We can patch this up.
[134:55.91]Although, yeah, let's focus on the first floor.
[135:05.41]I know I want to do something down there, but I got to figure this out first.
[135:12.27]There probably should be more than one room to go into.
[135:14.01]Because this can be a couple different rooms.
[135:17.29]So let's go like this.
[135:18.47]I'll change the paint.
[135:25.62]Keep it stone for now so I can know where the hell I'm going.
[135:42.63]Okay.
[135:47.67]One of these will be correct.
[136:12.58]Yeah, because it's like, are you going to pick the toilet, the heavenly room, or are you going to pick the devil, terrifying, scary room?
[136:18.56]That's the one you should have picked.
[136:21.32]Those of you that picked that one, you die.
[136:36.91]Well, you don't die.
[136:37.51]You're in a new adventure.
[136:43.49]OK, need a wall.
[137:02.04]Gotta be tighter.
[137:14.28]Oops.
[137:18.29]Stanley took the door on his left.
[137:22.11]That's true.
[137:26.55]Could you look up and see something up there, maybe?
[137:34.55]Is he making a hospital for all the elves that fell out of their beds?
[137:37.73]How do you get hospital from this?
[137:49.01]Hey guys, welcome to the elf hospital!
[137:58.06]I may have read that completely wrong as well.
[138:03.60]Alright, this door has to be really scary looking.
[138:05.16]It's got to be red, there's got to be like devil and demon shit all over it.
[138:13.09]I want some more coffee.
[138:13.69]I'll be right back.
[138:15.73]This is time to load up on some coffee.
[138:20.25]Back in two minutes.
[145:08.96]Figured out the storyline by the way.
[145:12.71]Figured out the storyline of the house.
[145:16.91]Trying to lure Frank from across the street over.
[145:19.21]Get trapped.
[145:26.34]In the funhouse.
[145:33.34]I didn't get a coffee.
[145:36.47]I got a delicious water based.
[145:42.83]Juice based beverage.
[145:49.80]Mouse trap house.
[145:50.64]It kind of is turning into that.
[145:51.74]Alright, let's keep going.
[145:55.82]What was I doing?
[145:56.24]Devil room?
[146:01.65]Yeah, OK, so the idea is to let me just do this now to get this idea out of the way.
[146:08.79]Uh, how do I paint?
[146:15.37]Like just with like a spray can.
[146:17.25]I saw some people did it.
[146:18.37]Joel did it.
[146:20.80]Is it like a dirt paint tool or something?
[146:22.66]Like how I want to put a big thing on the front of the house.
[146:29.38]It's like a paint tool or like a smear tool or something.
[146:37.70]Wonder if it was dirt painting.
[146:47.66]It was dirt.
[146:55.05]Like in this tool.
[146:58.95]It grass stains and dirt.
[147:01.39]OK, his stains.
[147:03.61]Can I actually put it on here?
[147:06.61]I can.
[147:07.35]Alright, hold on.
[147:08.23]This is important.
[147:14.48]Cool, okay.
[147:17.82]This one's probably the best.
[147:18.56]This one's the smallest.
[147:24.79]Footprints... Footprints are gonna go and lead people in the wrong direction.
[147:36.48]This one's not bad.
[147:37.32]Let's see.
[147:41.42]Alright.
[147:42.00]That one works.
[147:45.46]Resize.
[147:47.40]Perfect.
[147:47.90]Because I'm just going to draw Frank sucks.
[147:57.91]It's me.
[147:58.31]I'm Frank.
[148:05.85]What color should it be?
[148:11.71]Oh wait, hold on.
[148:12.35]It's another context menu.
[148:18.40]Here we go.
[148:19.34]Stain OK opacity type wet.
[148:22.84]Depth.
[148:24.86]Size cool.
[148:27.92]Rotation.
[148:30.57]And then vacuum able dirt.
[148:41.77]Try that.
[148:42.23]OK.
[148:56.58]I gotta make sure I can fit it on the house.
[149:49.43]I can't fit the S. Frank sucks.
[149:54.67]What are you talking about?
[149:56.37]What?
[149:57.29]Frank.
[150:04.92]Frank sucks.
[150:06.04]There we go.
[150:20.27]No, because I want him to open the door.
[150:22.53]I don't want the door to open it.
[150:24.63]I want... Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination.
[150:42.70]We have a whole storyline going.
[150:50.03]Alright, outside's good.
[151:01.58]Peter points you into the right direction.
[151:04.88]Okay.
[151:06.92]What do I want to work on?
[151:07.54]What room... I'm going to leave it up to you guys.
[151:12.77]Because this is going to take a very long time.
[151:14.99]But I'm willing to mess with this build for a while.
[151:18.49]Also, I...
[151:21.16]I'm willing to mess with this build, not only on stream.
[151:25.44]Let me ask you a question.
[151:27.98]This is for you.
[151:28.62]Let's get a poll in the chat.
[151:31.06]Would you prefer the next time I play House Flipper 2, there is an insanely elaborate, this routine plays out, but it's finished and I do it.
[151:43.07]And you get to experience it.
[151:44.47]And you kind of tell me where to go.
[151:45.59]Do you think that's fun?
[151:53.85]Because that'll also help me learn the game a lot more too.
[151:58.09]So I can make the, like, Frank sucks funhouse.
[152:03.94]And then you guys can go through it and you can guide Frank through.
[152:09.63]And I'll go full RP.
[152:11.37]And we'll play the music.
[152:22.25]Should I finish the Frank sucks house off stream?
[152:34.42]Because I will.
[152:36.00]OK, there's a lot of people saying yes.
[152:37.96]OK.
[152:46.30]Your build, your performance, Spaceman.
[152:48.88]Because I want to do the whole thing.
[152:52.56]I want to play scary music.
[152:54.36]I want to be like, honey, come on.
[152:57.08]I'm going over there.
[152:57.76]I'm going over there.
[152:58.42]Watch it for all.
[153:04.11]You must include Miku.
[153:06.61]We'll see.
[153:09.39]Because I'm going to be on a pretty extended holiday break.
[153:12.23]Like, I mean, obviously, you know, got a lot going on, but
[153:17.54]I feel like I could go total, just absolutely wacko.
[153:23.72]And make a gigantic, turn this into a gigantic thing and we play it on stream.
[153:27.13]I'll do it.
[153:27.49]That sounds fun.
[153:28.05]That actually sounds really fun to me.
[153:31.55]So let me save this.
[153:34.41]And let me do, I want to play with a few more things.
[153:38.27]I don't want you to see this though.
[153:39.69]Because this is going to be fun.
[153:43.95]Alright, we're going to put Frank's Frank sucks house in the in the draw for a little while.
[153:54.02]I want to try something here, though.
[154:01.46]Let's go huge.
[154:03.81]Let's go island.
[154:11.15]Because how big is it really?
[154:16.09]And how much bigger can you actually make it?
[154:18.77]Is this a border tool?
[154:25.44]I wonder if this is as big as it can be.
[154:31.57]Yeah, this is this is Max.
[154:40.43]So 300 by 300.
[154:45.49]blocks is the is the highest you can make so with that being said how tall can you make it if on the huge lot is there still that limitation for buildings I think there is okay there is let me know yes there is let's see looks like 80 blocks up I'm going to imagine
[155:12.18]I'm going to imagine that there's probably.
[155:14.04]I wonder if you could remove the limitation.
[155:19.29]With like cheats or console or something, I would bet you probably said some point you probably could.
[155:31.35]Yeah, it just probably won't be stable at all.
[155:35.71]But sometimes it's you don't really care much about that.
[155:39.39]What about this?
[155:40.63]Can you make like pools, like water?
[155:45.17]Doesn't look like it yet, because you can do holes.
[155:50.00]Stairs don't have a height limit.
[155:52.04]It's a bug.
[155:56.26]Make the Jerma resort.
[156:02.49]Well, let me, okay, let me ask you this.
[156:04.15]In the next, like, couple of hours, would you rather see me, okay, let's do another poll.
[156:08.67]Would you rather me start another project, like, another custom build, or would you rather me go flip a house?
[156:14.64]Because I know, I've got so many ideas for that Willy Wonka house now.
[156:18.24]That's going to be unbelievable when you see it next time.
[156:20.42]What do you guys think?
[156:22.65]You want me to spend, like, a couple hours just making something, or you want me to flip a house?
[156:31.56]Jerma island.
[156:39.69]Save the ideas for the Frank stream.
[156:41.33]Let's see.
[156:55.97]OK.
[156:57.32]Yeah, I think that makes sense to me.
[156:59.20]Because I can then come and show you what I've created.
[157:08.52]I'm going to put like two weeks into this house, by the way.
[157:13.32]I'm willing to put a bunch of... Because that's going to be so much fun.
[157:17.90]Okay, I'm into that.
[157:19.38]Let's go.
[157:19.76]We'll go flip a house.
[157:32.11]I'm going to try to make the Frank sucks RP playthrough like 20 minutes long to do the whole thing.
[157:38.35]At least.
[157:41.99]Alright.
[157:43.09]I got to get out of sandbox mode now.
[157:50.58]I bought a house.
[157:51.20]I was going to flip it.
[158:00.54]What happened to the horror funhouse?
[158:04.10]I'm going to... What the fuck just happened?
[158:07.73]I was like, speaking of funhouses.
[158:12.21]I'm going to do the rest of it off stream and I'm going to expand it and make it like 10 times bigger and more ridiculous.
[158:17.95]I don't want you to see it because I want you to help me play through it after I put like a week or two into that house.
[158:29.22]It's going to be an entire choose-your-own-adventure game inside of House Flipper.
[158:38.16]It also allows me to learn the game a little more, which I'm excited to do.
[158:41.19]So, alright, let's... I have two properties, right?
[158:45.21]Three stars on all these.
[158:53.20]Oh, I never did the sledgehammer quest.
[158:55.38]Okay, I'll speedrun some of these.
[158:58.11]Because I really want the sledgehammer.
[158:59.17]I'll do this one quick.
[159:09.82]Flip the whole town.
[159:19.52]Was I supposed to sell the door?
[159:21.48]I actually was supposed to sell the door.
[159:28.60]Are you sure?
[159:35.29]That's what I get for not reading the email.
[159:36.93]Hey, can you sell the door?
[159:45.81]Sure!
[159:46.03]That's a lot of trash.
[159:52.05]Get out of the way!
[159:53.48]Get out of the way!
[159:58.02]Yeah, that devil angel room is going to be expanded into... You have no idea.
[160:02.28]There's gonna be like nine rooms in that room.
[160:06.55]I have no idea what you... I'm actually really excited for that.
[160:08.99]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[160:16.59]And then he never streamed ever again.
[160:31.67]That sounds correct.
[160:40.41]Get the cell tool out, get rid of all this.
[160:52.18]Very dirty floor.
[161:00.34]Yeah, I want you guys to give me creativity, philosophy, structural integrity, and you're great.
[161:07.12]Keep in mind, I mean, I only had maybe like 30 in-game hours to do it at that point, at the point that you've seen it a week from now.
[161:16.49]Come on, you know what I mean?
[161:17.17]Like, be fair.
[161:21.41]Scares me every time.
[161:24.28]I'm working.
[161:24.80]New office to do?
[161:25.56]Got it.
[161:53.89]Thank you.
[161:54.64]I really appreciate doing business with reliable people, especially with so many fishy characters taking over this town.
[162:03.58]What do you mean?
[162:04.48]Ah, it's just a joke.
[162:06.08]I'm not a big fan of the fishing industry.
[162:08.34]Pinnikov is what it is thanks to the hard work of our lumberjacks.
[162:12.41]My father was one of them, and so was his father.
[162:15.57]But these days, you only hear about the fishermen.
[162:18.55]Our history is slowly getting erased.
[162:24.52]Uh, okay.
[162:24.68]I remember that.
[162:25.30]Well, I mean, I have a Willy Wonka choose your own adventure house to make.
[162:55.97]I'm gonna break my computer.
[162:57.29]I'm gonna get to like the image limit.
[163:12.87]Is there anything to clean in here?
[163:14.21]I think this is very clean.
[163:25.20]What do you want in here?
[163:27.94]Oh, a washer and dryer.
[163:42.89]No laundry basket.
[163:49.69]Alright.
[163:50.03]Do you use a laundry basket or do you throw all the laundry into the laundry room onto the ground and use it as a gigantic laundry basket?
[164:08.57]Both based.
[164:14.70]God damn it.
[164:31.54]Get out of the way.
[164:42.29]Look at that little gap right there.
[164:43.51]It's freaking me out.
[164:47.16]That's better.
[165:00.85]Nice.
[165:05.78]Alright, you want to buy a bunch of stuff.
[165:07.48]You want to get rid of all this junk.
[165:09.43]I can do that.
[165:10.25]Clean.
[165:10.67]Remember, clean first, then worry about everything else.
[165:21.17]Sell all the... Really?
[165:23.12]Oh, shit.
[165:23.52]Okay.
[165:27.12]Just those doors, that's it.
[165:36.75]Please make the basket face the right direction.
[165:38.71]It's alright.
[165:47.80]They don't want doors at all.
[165:55.20]What is still in here to sell?
[166:01.36]I just got inspiration for the Willy Wonka house.
[166:04.64]Oh, you bet your ass I did.
[166:08.19]You know what I'm talking about.
[166:10.35]But let's just pretend like you don't.
[166:17.14]Welcome, Matt.
[166:25.02]Where the hell is this thing?
[166:42.11]Oh, it's right here.
[166:42.93]I thought that was a welcome mat.
[166:46.90]Are you want new large doorframe?
[166:51.70]You want it right here, but I don't give a shit.
[166:53.56]I'm putting it here.
[166:57.62]Oh.
[167:05.10]How did I not get it right by now?
[167:32.39]What's the point of this one?
[167:36.27]This is some kind of malicious compliance type shit here.
[167:44.24]Even if I spaced them out, it would be kind of weird, wouldn't it?
[167:48.70]What's the point of the other two?
[167:50.64]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[167:55.10]You're a Redditor.
[167:56.82]Shh, don't say that that loud.
[167:59.44]Why is there a light switch on the ground?
[168:01.10]Shh, don't.
[168:08.58]I don't want people fucking to hear that.
[168:13.62]I used it once, huh?
[168:15.06]I used it once.
[168:16.16]Stop.
[168:16.48]Don't tell... Shut up.
[168:33.35]Damn it.
[168:44.75]Come on.
[168:49.13]How did not one of those go in?
[168:57.49]This is technically not trash.
[169:11.50]Alright, what do you want me to do in here?
[169:12.44]There's still something to sell.
[169:19.27]Sell the beams?
[169:26.85]What is this?
[169:35.63]The beam up... Oh, it's up here.
[169:39.83]Is it?
[169:42.89]The shelf.
[169:45.23]Oh, this thing.
[169:45.89]Okay, that's kind of blending in.
[169:47.03]Alright, now I need to... There's a lot of stuff in boxes.
[169:50.13]Let me get... Let me buy the shit today.
[169:51.85]Okay, let's start at the bottom.
[169:53.78]Carpet.
[169:54.50]You got it.
[169:57.50]Floor lamp.
[169:58.30]Sure.
[170:00.28]Corner.
[170:02.16]Uh, yep.
[170:04.08]Big, uh, big TV.
[170:06.28]I want a TV.
[170:10.78]Okay.
[170:12.64]Put the big shit down first.
[170:24.63]Raid from RTGame.
[170:26.21]What's going on, RT?
[170:27.87]Thanks for the raid.
[170:30.35]Welcome, RTGamers.
[170:34.93]Ow, my arm.
[170:36.65]That fucking hurts so bad.
[170:38.37]Are you guys alright?
[170:42.71]I lifted my arm up to stretch and I smashed my arm.
[170:45.21]Uh, yeah, we're playing House Flipper.
[170:54.31]House Lipper 2.
[170:57.49]I was in the custom build mode, but I had a grand idea.
[171:01.70]And so we left custom build mode and we're back into just the kind of campaign messing around.
[171:07.56]Thanks for the radio.
[171:08.04]Appreciate it.
[171:09.12]Was RT playing House Lipper 2?
[171:10.70]Yeah.
[171:19.33]Yeah.
[171:21.61]Oh, yeah.
[171:22.97]Oh, Pokémon.
[171:23.55]Just chilling, playing Pokémon.
[171:26.61]Very cool.
[171:33.58]My favorite Pokémon is Snarler.
[171:38.74]From, what, Gen 3?
[171:46.78]I'm not done with this yet.
[171:55.57]This is one that hisses.
[171:57.13]Hisses like a snake, but it looks like a fox.
[172:04.40]It's got like a weird snake-shaped body, but it has like a fox face and nose.
[172:07.90]And it wears like a little top hat.
[172:09.31]I think that one's kind of cool.
[172:31.32]What's the plan?
[172:32.12]That's the plan.
[172:39.36]You were playing a different game.
[172:57.85]In all capitals, what are you talking about?
[173:03.65]I'm telling you about my favorite Pokémon.
[173:06.01]Snarler.
[173:10.84]I'm just trying to get as many of you to unfollow as possible.
[173:13.64]That's the goal nowadays.
[173:20.55]Can this not fit in here?
[173:21.27]I don't like it.
[173:31.40]I like that though.
[173:33.08]Weirdly enough.
[173:41.39]What does Snarler evolve into?
[173:50.91]Snarler... Snarler Rock.
[173:57.76]He turns into like a stone enemy.
[174:23.10]I want this over here.
[174:35.26]Okay, Grandpa, it's time to come back inside.
[174:37.44]Yay!
[174:39.74]I played that game and I... Snarl... Snarl-a-Rock was my favorite.
[174:49.06]They used to be on Charlie Chaplin's show.
[175:00.64]Okay.
[175:02.08]Now I have to unpack the boxes.
[175:17.43]What's in here?
[175:18.35]I'll put the beaver picture here.
[175:22.43]Hmm.
[175:39.84]This is a museum, isn't it?
[175:51.73]I feel like these all... I like the staggering, but I feel like these all have to be kind of on the same line.
[175:56.55]This is where the TV goes.
[175:58.37]Where the hell... Where's the TV gonna go in here?
[176:00.15]I mean, you kind of have... Like this, right?
[176:06.60]How else would you do it?
[176:08.22]Yeah.
[176:08.36]Yeah.
[176:12.71]Changing the game plan.
[176:19.22]Look at the sketch.
[176:20.52]I want to do it my own way.
[176:23.16]And then he can criticize it.
[176:29.78]Wait, you don't think my way is better?
[176:42.42]This is for the kids.
[176:44.98]Kids can't look all the way up here.
[176:46.50]They won't.
[176:46.88]Look.
[176:47.66]There it is.
[176:48.10]The deer.
[176:49.44]Gotta give the kids something to look at.
[176:50.58]Let me see this.
[176:59.96]I'll rearrange.
[177:00.48]I just gotta get everything out of the box.
[177:05.83]Only supposed to be two doors in the room?
[177:07.95]That's fine.
[177:15.16]Kids just want their iPads.
[177:28.71]Go into the kitchen real quick.
[177:38.18]Uh, where's the kitchen?
[177:49.48]Alright, you win.
[177:51.56]You win.
[177:54.15]I... Okay, yep, you win.
[178:09.10]Congratulations, you win.
[178:15.58]What did I just... Oh, I can see where it wants you to put it.
[178:27.66]This is nice.
[178:43.67]I do really like the unpacking stuff.
[178:46.42]It's fun.
[178:46.80]It's just an extra layer of... Just, I don't know, scratching your brain.
[178:59.30]This does not look good at all.
[179:29.76]Damn it.
[179:36.52]Alright, actually, hold on, what if I do this?
[180:00.25]Cool.
[180:10.84]Put the axes in the bathroom.
[180:14.85]I think I got everything up.
[180:17.19]I just need to move everything around.
[180:19.33]There's a couple of places to clean, I think.
[180:22.95]Alright, yeah, I know you want it like this, but...
[180:29.42]You hired a designer.
[180:30.46]It's me, I'm here.
[180:32.22]Alright, I'll do it the way the picture wants it.
[181:06.43]The lamp over here, really?
[181:07.57]Where's the bookcase though?
[181:36.65]Go over a little bit.
[181:37.79]Yeah, there we go.
[181:38.43]That's much better.
[181:44.95]There.
[181:48.37]Okay.
[181:48.81]Everybody happy?
[182:04.27]There.
[182:04.89]Look at how cozy this is.
[182:22.16]Who's streaming today?
[182:22.90]What are you talking about?
[182:34.29]Nice.
[182:34.89]Okay.
[182:35.43]Moving on.
[182:36.13]What else do you want?
[182:36.95]Tons of shit in here to sell.
[182:41.31]Yep, yep, yep.
[182:48.98]Laptop.
[182:49.66]Another desk.
[182:52.53]A mouse?
[182:53.59]Okay, new desk.
[182:59.57]Do you guys want your desk looking out of a window or do you want it facing a wall?
[183:03.14]That's a good question.
[183:10.12]Window?
[183:13.92]Facing a window I never always liked because I always felt like the glare would hit me in the face from the sun or something.
[183:21.20]Even if you had curtains or blinds in it, I always felt like there was light coming through somehow.
[183:31.08]Window on the side?
[183:32.44]Yeah.
[183:34.32]It's distracting?
[183:35.04]Yeah.
[183:41.89]What kind of insane person looks at a wall?
[183:47.19]I feel like a lot of people have their desks against a wall.
[183:51.77]Especially if you have a computer.
[183:52.91]I'm just doing this to pretend like I didn't do it.
[184:06.41]And just say it would look like that when I came in.
[184:09.94]Okay.
[184:13.12]You want a mouse, a laptop.
[184:20.74]You want...
[184:22.88]Trash bin.
[184:23.80]I'm going to two star this one.
[184:29.28]I want the sledgehammer tool.
[184:33.88]That's good.
[184:47.21]Calendar.
[184:49.13]End of the stream voice.
[184:50.49]No, not yet.
[184:51.45]Nope.
[184:56.38]I'm still here for a little bit.
[184:58.05]Yard.
[185:01.97]My crew is moving here.
[185:03.31]We're a group of video content creators.
[185:06.90]Influencers, if you will.
[185:08.52]And we got lucky when my uncle offered to rent us his spacious Seaside house.
[185:13.31]He's a sailor and he's rarely ever home.
[185:15.55]So it isn't in the best shape.
[185:17.03]But I'm sure it will be perfect for our needs once it gets fixed.
[185:19.85]Which is where you come in.
[185:21.73]What do we need?
[185:22.85]Mostly some cleaning and refreshing the walls.
[185:24.55]Definitely replacing old furniture.
[185:25.91]Oh, and unpacking our stuff.
[185:28.04]There better be a shitload of pizza boxes on the ground.
[185:30.18]Okay, thanks for helping us.

[186:19.27]I'm such a fucking.
[186:21.03]Yeah, I. When I make it to like 70 years old, I'm going to I want this.

[186:36.40]Like like a year.
[186:41.80]You're a sucker for beach houses.
[186:43.14]I I really am.
[186:48.18]My whole, guys, I belong on the beach.
[186:52.00]I belong on the beach.
[186:54.38]I got a lot of sand in Vegas.
[186:57.91]But let's go over what my life looks like.
[187:01.15]Just my life.
[187:02.85]My wardrobe is tank top, tank top, tank tops, shorts, and sandals.
[187:15.41]Sometimes just comfy shorts and t-shirts.
[187:20.46]That all of my outfits have beach outfits.
[187:22.96]All of them.
[187:30.17]I like having like some like sound during sleep.
[187:36.63]Right?
[187:36.81]Just having these just here and that just... Which just would put me to sleep every single night.
[187:45.24]I like to bake in the sun.
[187:47.96]I love the sun.
[187:49.68]Vegas is great for that.
[187:51.22]You know, just sit out there.
[187:53.15]Let the sun hit you in the face for like 20, 30, 40 minutes.
[187:55.53]Just let it just hit you.
[188:00.09]I belong on the beach.
[188:07.01]I just want to sit there with a fucking Corona in my hand.
[188:12.72]and just get the sunburn outline of the Corona on my body while I'm lying there.
[188:29.21]Just a lime in it.
[188:30.77]Just like sip on it.
[188:32.41]I fall asleep with sunglasses down on my nose.
[188:35.41]So I get like weird double eyes sunburn.
[188:38.17]There's like, it's a weird spot where there's two other eyes on my face.
[188:43.61]I want it.
[188:44.01]I think that's everything out here.
[189:05.01]Pizza!
[189:10.59]But they haven't lived here yet.
[189:18.68]It's not technically the gamer house yet.
[189:21.80]The streamer house.
[189:22.50]They have not lived here yet.
[189:26.22]The previous owner.
[189:28.00]That's a previous owner pizza box.
[189:32.72]Now don't worry.
[189:33.12]We'll make sure it's a real streamer room.
[189:35.91]I promise that at least.
[189:49.04]Do you miss a beach pizza from Massachusetts?
[189:52.18]I miss a lot of food from Massachusetts.
[190:04.65]Gotta go out there in a minute.
[190:11.41]You guys know this.
[190:12.15]I'm a huge sub sandwich kind of guy.
[190:17.86]I'm a big pizza and subs kind of.
[190:20.02]I love that vibe.
[190:24.74]Vegas is amazing, but we've talked about this a lot.
[190:29.46]It's got some of the best restaurants in the world.
[190:31.14]Some of the best food I've ever eaten in my whole life has been here.
[190:34.82]But one of those just non-chain, just kind of East Coast style sub shops.
[190:43.37]They're just not really out here.
[190:45.65]Some of them exist.
[190:46.33]Some of them are okay.
[190:48.75]But not like it is over there.
[191:18.24]Okay, do you guys, what do you guys call them?
[191:20.46]Do you call them subs?
[191:23.38]Heroes?
[191:24.62]Hoagies?
[191:26.10]Grinders?
[191:26.78]Let's do a poll.
[191:27.82]What do you call it?
[191:37.25]What the fuck are you guys saying?
[191:42.77]What is wrong with you guys?
[192:12.85]These poor plants.
[192:22.21]Mods, mods, the class is being inappropriate.
[192:24.41]Alright, I'll do the poll.
[192:26.21]Alright.
[192:29.87]You call it.
[192:31.25]What do you call it?
[192:35.99]Sub.
[192:37.81]Hero.
[192:39.81]Grinder.
[192:42.94]Hoagie.
[192:46.89]Sandwich.
[192:59.19]Why am I getting question marks?
[193:04.66]Have you guys never had a sandwich in your life before?
[193:07.86]Have you guys never had a sub sandwich before?
[193:11.99]Who am I talking to?
[193:12.85]Am I streaming to an alien planet right now?
[193:24.27]In like a distant galaxy?
[193:46.99]I just moved somewhere that calls them grinders and I don't get it.
[193:49.29]Ooh.
[193:52.93]To me, it was always just sub.
[193:54.57]It was like, oh yeah, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna, I'm gonna eat a sub.
[193:58.01]I'm gonna get a sub.
[193:58.85]You want a sub?
[194:02.11]You can change item style.
[194:03.15]Ooh.
[194:08.70]You really shook the table with this question.
[194:14.44]It's a sandwich.
[194:17.17]I've heard hero a lot.
[194:22.91]Especially at least, at least in the United States, the US has, um, a lot of different ways people say it.
[194:29.15]I don't really know why.
[194:34.94]Wait a minute.
[194:35.28]Was that just a wooden bed?
[194:39.02]What did I just sell?
[194:40.02]That was a wood bed where the mattress was a, was, was a wooden mattress.
[194:48.74]Was that just a frame?
[194:49.80]That was a huge frame.
[194:56.24]Alright, 52%.
[194:57.72]But what about the others?
[195:02.22]5% say Grinder.
[195:03.17]4% say Hoagie.
[195:04.77]Yeah, I mean, most people say.
[195:09.79]Hoagie, I didn't like.
[195:11.79]Oh, can I get a Hoagie?
[195:13.01]I always didn't like that one.
[195:32.81]Wait, let me buy stuff first because I'll mess this all up.
[195:35.27]Alright.
[195:44.00]Oh, I'm getting hungry.
[195:45.90]Here we go.
[195:46.50]Ready?
[195:47.34]Pick one of these.
[195:48.82]And I don't want to see any like, I don't want to see any like DansGame face.
[195:52.06]I don't want to see any like, what the fuck?
[195:54.61]Just pick one of these because you are going to decide what I eat for lunch today.
[195:59.47]Good luck.
[196:21.76]Why am I doing this?
[196:22.72]I don't know.
[196:23.16]It's fun.
[196:34.35]I have to take away the word sub.
[196:35.51]This is a sub.
[196:37.77]Imagine that's what I'm saying.
[196:43.49]I'll describe them.
[196:44.07]Hold on.
[197:14.35]Hurry up.
[197:14.85]I'm right.
[197:15.35]It's like five different items.
[197:19.09]I jumped typing it.
[197:20.07]I just got a lot of words.
[197:21.25]Alright.
[197:41.65]What am I?
[197:42.05]What am I eating for lunch?
[197:45.80]These are all subs, by the way.
[197:47.64]Except, no, they're not.
[197:51.88]They're not all subs.
[197:57.57]There are two things here that I actually don't want.
[197:59.39]I just put them on because they made me laugh for a minute.
[198:10.39]There are actually... There's two things on here I do not want to eat.
[198:16.52]but whatever yeah look at oh look at all look at this chat this chat gets it look at how much you guys get it are you serious look at that are you kidding me the other options are like gross
[198:45.32]I made sure that you guys were gonna pick the one I wanted.
[198:47.96]Ham and cheese on sourdough isn't bad.
[199:01.97]Oh yeah.
[199:05.42]Is the turkey and avocado on rye?
[199:07.26]I just said on rye because I was imagining just somebody being like, yeah, let me get a turkey and avocado on fucking rye.
[199:12.93]I don't like rye bread.
[199:14.39]I don't like it.
[199:15.21]I think it's gross.
[199:17.59]I was just like LARPing as a guy.
[199:19.43]I was like RPing as somebody.
[199:24.03]That's the one I didn't want.
[199:30.65]You're so foul for this.
[199:37.08]That's the one I want.
[199:38.44]Turkey and avocado is great.
[199:40.70]Rye bread is very, very specific.
[199:45.08]I only like rye on one very specific thing.
[199:52.21]I like wheat bread, white bread, French bread, sourdough, pretzel bread.
[200:01.74]I'm not a, I'm not a pumpernickel.
[200:04.25]Mm-mm.
[200:05.35]No, it's just like, it's kind of, it has too much flavor.
[200:07.71]I like, I don't want bread to have a bunch of flavor.
[200:10.23]I want the ingredients to have the flavor.
[200:13.03]I want the bread to hold it together and have a nice light texture and light flavor to it.
[200:17.86]So the other stuff, it comes out.
[200:24.30]What about a Reuben?
[200:25.30]Reuben is the only exception.
[200:27.94]Because the whole thing works together.
[200:35.10]But if I had a choice between a Reuben and just a typical kind of hot pastrami with mustard, I think I always have to go with the pastrami, the hot pastrami.
[200:47.22]I love Reubens, I do, but the other stuff they put in a Reuben, like the sauerkraut, I got to be in the mood for it.
[200:55.03]I like it, but I would prefer the pastrami.
[201:00.57]I love corned beef.
[201:01.31]Corned beef is like one of my favorite foods.
[201:03.79]Corned beef hash.
[201:05.95]Straw me.
[201:08.09]Corned beef sandwiches.
[201:17.98]Hammond Swiss is great too.
[201:18.94]Yeah, it is.
[201:21.50]I was on autopilot and I didn't realize I was just putting like stuff on.
[201:30.97]The AI took over and I'm not sure what the AI was doing here.
[201:39.33]What is the lift to sell?
[201:50.30]How big do you like the bread?
[201:54.14]Oh.
[201:58.41]You mean how thick the slices of the bread are?
[202:02.59]Avocado is foul.
[202:04.48]No, it's not.
[202:05.54]It's not.
[202:06.14]Come on.
[202:11.74]Sorry.
[202:12.96]Time for a food podcast.
[202:24.31]What do I want?
[202:25.97]I want to clean the rest.
[202:26.73]I'm not doing this room yet.
[202:27.61]I've got to clean the rest of the house.
[202:30.45]Nothing.
[202:30.79]Is that the only spot?
[202:33.45]I don't know.
[202:35.51]Yeah, just cleaned up this one.
[202:41.72]Avocado is objectively nasty.
[202:47.18]Guacamole is...
[202:49.27]It's amazing.
[202:50.57]A good guacamole is great.
[202:52.03]Fresh right there.
[202:59.45]I can understand your opinion on that in a few scenarios because sometimes avocado can be a little mushy.
[203:06.42]And if it's too much on a sandwich or too much on something, you get that kind of... I get it.
[203:14.48]But if it's good, it's not a whole lot.
[203:16.20]It just kind of adds to it.
[203:20.11]Also, avocado, if it's a slice, tends to just shoot out of the bread like a cannon.
[203:25.39]You'll take a bite of avocado sandwich with like, you know, turkey and whatever, and the avocado shoots across the fucking room.
[203:37.70]Nothing else in here, okay.
[203:48.51]That's a skill issue?
[203:49.55]Oh, it absolutely is, but I don't want to play Dark Souls when I eat a sandwich.
[203:52.44]Alright, let's do this one first.
[203:57.28]What do you want?
[203:58.10]You want... We'll two-star this one as well.
[204:10.23]Yeah, can I get Dark Souls on Rai?
[204:17.60]The chef in the back just starts taking the ingredients and fucking throwing them at you.
[204:22.56]Yeah, wait, what comes on the Dark Souls on Rye?
[204:25.44]It's avocado, turkey, ham, Thousand Island dressing, and a side of fries.
[204:33.49]I'll take that.
[204:33.99]Alright, here we go.
[204:35.73]And the guy just crow hops and throws a fucking slab of ham at your head.
[204:59.74]That actually happened to me.
[205:03.62]What?
[205:23.72]Weren't you making a Peter Family Guy?
[205:29.51]I mean, yeah, I was like three hours ago, but the plan changed a few times.
[205:34.03]Plant stand, let's put that here.
[205:50.03]I could just parry it, I'm a secure role player.
[205:54.79]Oh, this is the thing that, uh, that Squeaks used.
[206:00.56]It was all lit up though.
[206:04.44]That's funny.
[206:20.07]I actually kind of like that.
[206:21.17]I like the minimal look.
[206:27.30]This thing doesn't tick either.
[206:31.68]I love it.
[206:44.94]Replace the batteries?
[206:45.76]No, I'm the person that removes the batteries from all the clocks.
[207:01.54]And if you want to know who it was, it was me.
[207:03.84]Like, I'll just tell you.
[207:17.01]Nice.
[207:42.48]Mom's weekly book club in the middle with the kitchen chairs.
[207:50.69]Alright, should we like have a book club where we've read a fake book?
[207:57.33]We just sit there and pretend and like I talk about it and you guys give takes on the book that we've read.
[208:05.37]So like the 10 people that come into the chat are just like, what the fuck, what book is this?
[208:12.49]Print up a fake label.
[208:16.61]Remember the Pegasus King thing?
[208:18.61]Imagine doing that with a book.
[208:20.01]And just reading, pretending to read it.
[208:22.62]Like you guys are all on the first page, right?
[208:25.40]Let's go.
[208:30.38]How about a real book club?
[208:32.40]You uncultured swine.
[208:35.94]A real book club requires not only all of you to read a book, it means I do too.
[208:46.53]And I'm sorry, Garfield, Foxtrot, and, you know, non sequitur.
[209:00.78]They take a little bit more precedence over that.
[209:15.94]Yeah, this is the person whose turn it is to talk about the book, the chapter.
[209:18.62]And it's a swivel chair, so they have to, like, address each person.
[209:23.03]Oh, you have a question about that?
[209:25.29]Yeah.
[209:27.41]John, what did you think?
[209:29.59]Oh, interesting, yeah.
[209:31.58]Mary, that's a good point about how the character developed.
[209:51.23]Something weird.
[209:52.15]This is a scary house.
[209:55.21]To me, this was placed here very, very, very quickly because I was down the street.
[210:10.63]How do I put dirt in here?
[210:11.57]Oh, here we go.
[210:23.68]What's the title of the real book we're reading?
[210:36.54]Clyde and the Journey Through Time, colon.
[210:45.94]Stopwatch.
[210:52.44]What a magical stopwatch that Clyde finds.
[210:56.78]Where he can... And this is like a part of a series.
[211:01.94]This is like book three in the series.
[211:10.67]His ass is not reading.
[211:24.16]Clyde's colonoscopy?
[211:34.77]Why would we read that book?
[211:36.09]Yeah, and this fucking thing is like 700 manuscript pages.
[211:47.04]It's a thousand pages.
[211:50.78]This is an epic.
[211:54.74]This is a huge story.
[211:56.28]I think this room, yep, this room's done.
[212:06.37]What does it want to actually... It's kind of close.
[212:14.90]I thought I was fucking this whole thing up, but that was very close.
[212:18.98]It's just the table goes here.
[212:31.40]What are some of the other rooms I need?
[212:32.74]I have zero stars.
[212:35.82]Alright.
[212:38.26]This is better.
[212:48.30]Rooms like this always give me so much trouble.
[212:49.74]Like, where does this go?
[213:01.53]I mean, honestly.
[213:02.39]That gives me a lot of room.
[213:17.35]And then a TV goes right there.
[213:30.86]It's not even that bad.
[213:31.90]It really isn't.
[213:32.50]I know it's supposed to be a closet, but that really is not a terrible thing.
[213:40.73]Because I know this is like, whoa, that's funny.
[213:43.05]But this whole room is now open.
[213:45.45]Or whatever else you want to do in here.
[213:49.53]A microwave?
[213:51.28]I just need to put it somewhere for now.
[213:52.62]Alright, what else do you want in here?
[213:55.08]Another bed.
[214:07.23]It's like a hotel, isn't it?
[214:09.49]Bed and breakfast.
[214:25.52]That's killing me.
[214:27.04]Somebody said, imagine dropping your phone behind the bed.
[214:31.00]If you drop something back here, you cannot get it.
[214:33.84]You need to get a construction worker to help you.
[214:41.32]If something falls back here, not too far for you to get under there, you are fucked.
[214:50.23]What if you can't reach it?
[214:51.11]What if it falls in that corner?
[214:53.18]You're going to have to lift the bed up.
[214:59.16]If it falls directly in that corner, you might really not be able to get in there.
[215:04.15]You'd have to lift the whole bed up.
[215:10.92]There, that solves it.
[215:31.63]I mean, I know they want it to be bang bang, right?
[215:34.42]A lot of shit is supposed to go in this room.
[215:45.71]There's a lot of stuff in this room.
[215:46.95]There's a whole bunch of stuff I have to take out of the box.
[215:59.14]I can't do bunk beds.
[216:27.88]microphone this is supposed to be like the streamer house it wants it wants two beds in here and it wants like a desk with a with a microphone
[216:59.47]Shit, there's too much stuff in here.
[217:11.28]What is he even talking into?
[217:16.84]Must be a book club.
[217:19.98]When's he gonna notice?
[217:21.79]What?
[217:28.89]Dude, it wants another desk in here.
[217:31.03]How are you supposed to do this?
[217:37.64]It wants another desk in here?
[217:44.04]What, what, am I missing something in particular?
[217:46.86]What, I don't, it's this, it wants it in this room.
[218:05.07]Hold on.
[218:05.45]I gotta figure out this puzzle.
[218:06.61]I'm so intrigued by this.
[218:09.41]Oh, that's how it works.
[218:10.13]Okay.
[218:11.35]Good.
[218:11.77]Got it.
[218:21.02]Put the microwave as the monitor.
[218:26.54]Welcome back guys to Microwave City!
[218:29.30]We test out microwaves.
[218:33.96]There are nine videos on this channel.
[218:36.04]Total.
[218:39.12]But, I mean, these videos get two or three million views a month.
[218:44.54]Forever.
[218:46.75]I'm the fucking genius that came up with the Microwave channel.
[218:50.69]People are always looking for it.
[219:01.00]It wants me to paint this too.
[219:03.47]Let me just see if I'm going absolutely out of my mind here.
[219:07.97]Okay.
[219:26.74]This all has to go in here.
[219:28.02]Okay, here.
[219:32.12]One bed, one desk?
[219:39.44]It wants another desk.
[219:41.28]No, it... That was weird.
[219:45.86]It definitely wants another desk.
[219:48.80]I swear when I opened the menu, it wanted another bed.
[219:51.80]If you rewind, you'll see it.
[219:52.64]There's a bug.
[219:56.50]I bugged it out.
[219:58.21]I pressed the button too many times.
[219:59.05]Too fast.
[220:03.12]If you guys didn't hear, I was going... I was clicking as fast as I could.
[220:09.68]And I heard the Windows sound go... Then my webcam turned off and turned on and shit.
[220:18.17]Okay.
[220:19.31]So, that being said, let's get some of this shit out of the way.
[220:25.73]I'm putting this in here.
[220:28.69]On here.
[220:31.67]Got energy drinks.
[220:32.49]Cool.
[220:56.49]He wants even more of these.
[221:05.18]I'm just putting them down so I can get them.
[221:06.44]So I can see what the hell.
[221:17.61]Oh my god.
[221:18.65]There are technically two different rooms.
[221:22.23]They're technically two different rooms.
[221:24.95]This is not a closet.
[221:25.95]This is a different room.
[221:31.83]I thought this was a closet for this room.
[221:43.80]Oh, goddammit.
[221:44.80]Okay.
[221:50.22]Get rid of everything.
[221:53.44]Okay, let's do this again.
[221:55.44]So in this room, you want a dresser, a mirror, and a wardrobe.
[222:16.11]Changing that.
[222:26.07]That's why everybody was Pepe laughing.
[222:27.83]I was like, this is not two different rooms.
[222:31.12]This is the same room.
[222:32.10]This is the same room.
[222:39.02]Now, alright.
[222:40.28]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[222:47.73]Put the microwave above the dresser.
[222:50.61]Free.
[222:51.19]What?
[222:53.34]What?
[223:06.23]Imagine having to go like... Alright.
[223:10.53]Hey, man, you want some pizza rolls?
[223:11.75]Hey, bro!
[223:19.54]Perfect spot to microwave the burritos.
[223:21.62]Uh, I'll fix it.
[223:26.56]The bed is fine over here.
[223:31.19]This desk is going to go... right here, whatever.
[223:44.97]See, that's why I thought I wanted two desks, because it kept resetting it.
[223:51.58]This is a based desk towards window enjoyer.
[223:57.57]Fucking bird flies straight in the second it opens and hits him right in the face.
[224:01.45]Can I shorten this?
[224:22.02]Or is it just big?
[224:26.71]And it is big, isn't it?
[224:38.63]These actually can kind of stay here.
[224:57.13]Bad feng shui to have a desk towards a window.
[224:59.21]Is it actually?
[224:59.65]Because I don't do that.
[225:11.02]Get those drinks in the fridge.
[225:12.44]They're probably empty.
[225:13.32]I think it's just supposed to be like, look, we're gamers.
[225:31.60]Better.
[225:33.46]Alright.
[225:33.80]That looks pretty good.
[225:39.56]Bad feng shui to have the door open to your back.
[225:46.62]Okay.
[225:50.86]Oh, company of champions.
[225:53.71]Good spot for it.
[225:56.05]There's the computer.
[225:56.81]I was going to say, where's the computer?
[226:12.43]Nice.
[226:14.73]Triple monitors.
[226:16.01]Hell yeah.
[226:40.83]Hang them on the chair.
[226:43.39]There we go.
[226:45.59]What is this?
[226:47.45]Camera?
[226:48.03]Oh, okay.
[226:52.49]Mouse.
[226:55.93]Nice.
[226:58.34]Paint time.
[226:59.16]Alright, what do you want for paint?
[227:01.86]You want warm green vibrant.
[227:03.68]Let's see how good this looks.
[227:14.11]That keyboard is facing you.
[227:17.95]I'll fix it.
[227:34.67]You're gonna sit on those and break them?
[227:37.49]They'll be okay.
[227:52.71]Hopefully I get a point to upgrade this.
[227:54.55]This is one of the greatest sound effects.
[228:05.56]That paint tack sound.
[228:11.63]Are there ASMR videos of a dude just painting a wall with the fucking gain up all the way?
[228:17.03]Because I'll start making it.
[228:47.65]This is going to totally transform this whole room.
[228:52.25]Look, sometimes all you need is a little bit of paint.
[229:12.02]Yeah, so that video is just a completely white-walled room.
[229:19.18]And it's me with a roller.
[229:21.63]And a bunch of paint.
[229:22.77]And the video starts and it's like, okay, we can do some painting, guys.
[229:25.05]I'm just painting with a poster.
[229:31.63]Okay, if I take the poster back, will it have the wallpaper behind it, I wonder?
[229:34.81]Let's find out.
[229:46.20]Who cares?
[229:51.52]Hey, it was better on that wall anyways.
[229:53.18]Actually, it looks kind of good.
[230:09.07]I like it.
[230:21.18]Oh, but anyway, so I'm in a room with a big roller.
[230:25.19]I'm just painting.
[230:28.59]And the whole idea with this video is this video is like four to five plus six hours long.
[230:35.22]The comments on the video are turned off.
[230:38.59]And I paint all the walls.
[230:40.95]And then I lie down on the ground.
[230:42.97]And there's like four people come in with rollers.
[230:45.27]And just paint the whole ground and me while I'm on the ground.
[230:49.19]And I just lie there.
[230:51.19]For like another 30 straight minutes.
[230:53.47]And somebody's going to wake up to that video.
[230:56.05]And be like, what the fuck happened?
[230:59.04]The whole room is green.
[231:00.80]He's green too.
[231:02.14]Lying.
[231:03.38]Like he's lying like a pencil on the ground.
[231:06.74]And the ground is green.
[231:10.56]What happened?
[231:16.15]Can you imagine starting that video?
[231:17.61]Imagine skipping through that video?
[231:21.17]Okay, guys, it's, uh, me, Jeremy.
[231:23.51]I'm here to, uh, gonna be painting some walls.
[231:25.84]Uh, it's gonna be green.
[231:27.36]Uh, lime green.
[231:29.12]Just like a nice, fresh squeeze of lime juice.
[231:32.32]Uh, join me.
[231:32.98]Just relax for a little while.
[231:34.40]And maybe this will help you get to sleep.
[231:36.42]And, uh, and then you skip to, like, four and a half hours in, and I'm on the ground.
[231:40.79]All the walls are green, and I'm covered in the green paint.
[231:43.63]Like, I'm part of the ground.
[231:44.39]That's the only reason why I would make that video.
[231:53.46]What am I missing?
[232:06.84]No, I got everything, didn't I?
[232:10.17]Oh, you want something else.
[232:11.17]Oh, trim.
[232:24.66]Where does it want the paint here?
[232:28.66]Just one accent, maybe?
[232:29.78]I'm curious.
[232:46.27]This is so much better.
[232:47.49]Oh my God, it does look a lot better.
[232:49.93]You're missing a spot.
[232:54.01]Actually, that looks good.
[232:58.23]The shelf.
[233:04.23]Oh, God damn it, OK.
[233:07.61]I made it look better.
[233:16.18]Nobody even would have known.
[233:20.14]Let's continue decorating.
[233:21.30]Alright, good.
[233:24.75]It's not done.
[233:27.93]Yeah, it is.
[233:28.67]I can stay there.
[233:33.55]Look at the difference.
[233:38.49]Cool.
[233:45.22]Turn the vibrance up.
[233:51.36]Oh, that's a gamer room.
[233:52.50]Alright, yeah.
[233:57.71]Okay, there's a few other rooms to do.
[233:59.15]I only have 29,000 right now.
[234:04.13]Oh, I bought a house, that's why.
[234:05.17]Upstairs.
[234:17.52]Okay, here we go.
[234:18.14]What do you want?
[234:21.72]Just paint and unboxing.
[234:34.76]The whole thing blew over the top.
[234:36.38]OK, well, I'm going to listen to the client.
[234:40.16]Not going to tell the client what to do.
[234:52.15]I have to get a painting point here soon.
[234:53.55]I painted so many walls.
[235:01.30]Oh, hell yeah.
[235:06.37]Not yet.
[235:06.75]Almost there.
[235:07.19]62%.
[235:07.47]That'll just go so much quicker.
[235:13.89]Are there cockroaches in this, like, the first one?
[235:19.70]I don't think... I haven't seen them yet.
[235:21.24]I think what's good to know, too, is... So the game just came out a few days ago.
[235:31.72]And...
[235:33.47]House Slipper 1 had a lot of content additions.
[235:39.65]This base game and this engine feel like if they add a bunch of stuff, this could be wow-y.
[235:46.29]This could be, like, spectacularly good.
[235:50.18]Like, unbeatably good.
[236:00.63]That sandbox mode, getting more additions, more houses to flip, more things to do.
[236:09.08]I feel like this could be a real monstrous banger.
[236:14.12]More so than it already is.
[236:15.08]I mean, I like it already.
[236:18.22]I think it's a worthy successor to the first one.
[236:22.26]And this is the base game, so...
[236:25.60]All the content that's in House Flipper 1, like the pets and the gardening and the... They did like an HGTV thing and there's like a ton of stuff they added.
[236:36.56]This is just base game.
[236:48.17]I'll get that little strip.
[236:59.01]And they've already talked about how they're already working on stuff.
[237:04.44]They made like an announcement yesterday, the day before, saying like, hey, we know there's like some things we're going to add with things, some things we're doing.
[237:11.68]So there'll probably be some patches in the next period here.
[237:16.68]But they have talked about it already, so looking forward to it.
[237:25.46]I like this color a lot.
[237:34.01]Was it Sky Blue?
[237:36.59]Robin's Egg Blue?
[237:37.17]What would you call it?
[237:57.41]Powder Blue?
[238:00.23]Muted Pastel Blue?
[238:06.22]You gonna go to the sphere?
[238:07.56]You mean the Vegas sphere?
[238:10.26]Probably eventually.
[238:11.08]I feel like I have to save at least once.
[238:18.11]The inside.
[238:41.16]We're good.
[238:42.68]Although, do I have to move this to get to the... Did I paint it or did I... Yep, I got it.
[238:51.20]Put Term of Venus on the sphere.
[238:57.84]Isn't it like a shitload of money to put it up there for like a minute?
[239:21.41]What are the limitations of what you can put up there?
[239:25.03]Because I've heard of all kinds of shit being put up there.
[239:28.09]Could you theoretically be like, hey, yeah, I'll pay for it.
[239:31.53]Here's my YouTube video of me doing like a makeup tutorial.
[239:43.82]I didn't even do that.
[239:44.54]It was backwards.
[239:52.12]Is this for the top?
[239:53.92]I think it's just for accents.
[240:00.75]What do you think?
[240:01.39]This wall here or this one here?
[240:04.33]Can you even play videos on that thing?
[240:08.19]Probably not.
[240:08.83]I don't know.
[240:13.54]Both sidewalls?
[240:20.02]Let's try both sidewalls.
[240:26.38]Somebody streams from it.
[240:27.50]There's like Fortnite gameplay on there with a facecam in the corner, but because of the way that the LEDs or whatever are and the spherical nature of the ball, their facecam is just ridiculously distorted.
[240:42.01]They have a huge head and a huge nose and stuff.
[240:49.36]That'd be really funny.
[240:53.76]It's like a big fisheye lens on their face.
[241:02.73]Ooh, I like that.
[241:04.45]Who suggested that?
[241:05.79]Good call.
[241:20.85]The sphere is 450,000 for one day, 650,000 for one week.
[241:28.39]There's definitely limitations on it.
[241:30.21]You can't just be like, hey, I got a million dollars.
[241:31.94]Can I stream to every Vegas person's commute?
[241:36.08]Be like, no, bro, get the fuck out of here.
[241:38.16]Shut the fuck up.
[241:41.42]No, go home.
[241:57.31]No, I wouldn't want to do a ga- I would want to do a, you know, like just be in a wizard costume and do an elaborate routine where you're like casting spells and stuff.
[242:06.05]You're like, it's me, the weather wizard.
[242:08.24]I'm going to try as hard as I can in Las Vegas to try to make snow.
[242:12.56]Here we go.
[242:15.54]Like lightning coming out of his fingers up into the fucking sphere.
[242:19.36]Find out what the weather is going to be.
[242:20.96]If it's going to rain, right?
[242:22.36]Let's say it's going to rain at like between 2 and 4 o'clock.
[242:28.23]Vegas doesn't get a lot of rain.
[242:29.29]We get sometimes.
[242:30.53]It's like not very much.
[242:32.63]Can you imagine getting the forecast?
[242:38.37]According to the AccuWeather forecast,
[242:41.45]At 3 o'clock, it's going to start raining.
[242:44.05]So, between 1 and 3.30, 1 and 4 p.m., the weather wizard's going to be in there, fucking shooting, like, lightning bolts up, and it's going to hit the top of the sphere, and he's, like, do a whole routine.
[242:56.19]And then it finally starts, and he'll be like, I did it!
[242:58.83]I did it!
[242:59.77]I control the universe!
[243:02.03]Do you think people on their commute would, would, do you, do you think people, no one would give a fuck.
[243:15.38]It doesn't have audio.
[243:19.40]It would look like a wizard trapped in a bubble.
[243:22.04]Just yelling.
[243:23.76]And then it would just rain.
[243:26.24]Context would be lost.
[243:28.90]Oh, I got it.
[243:29.36]Nice.
[243:30.76]Let's see how big it is.
[243:34.78]Holy shit.
[243:35.42]This thing is like a blood-borne weapon.
[243:49.62]That's pretty cool, though.
[243:56.52]That's a big square.
[244:04.29]That makes that way easier.
[244:06.09]Okay, cool.
[244:13.52]Nice.
[244:13.74]This needs to move.
[244:16.34]Over there.
[244:17.78]The weather wizard.
[244:24.11]The next day.
[244:24.57]It's supposed to be sunny.
[244:26.53]And there's a guy dressed in a different costume.
[244:30.47]He's got orange robes on.
[244:32.57]Ladies and gentlemen of Las Vegas.
[244:35.27]It is I, the sun wizard.
[244:38.33]I've heard that the rain wizard has been tormenting the city.
[244:42.33]Not anymore.
[244:44.13]Orange beams coming out and then it clears, the rain clears.
[244:52.63]Sun wizard versus the rain wizard.
[245:00.04]120 degrees for all.
[245:06.00]It's gonna be hot out there.
[245:18.05]What are these?
[245:21.77]That's Bugleberry.
[245:25.86]Yeah, it is.
[245:32.60]It's a nice day for a margarita.
[245:36.90]And then they have to have a wizard battle in the sphere.
[245:41.64]And what you do is you contact all the Las Vegas weather places and say, don't tell anybody what the weather is.
[245:49.37]Tell me.
[245:51.00]So then when the wizards have the fucking battle, the rain and the sun wizard have a battle in there, people are just like, holy shit, who's going to win?
[245:57.47]What happens?
[246:01.48]They get a huge battle in the sphere.
[246:03.54]It's like, holy shit, the sun wizard just like, he just electrocuted him.
[246:07.76]He just punched him in the face.
[246:09.38]They're flying around, attacking each other with like wizard spells.
[246:12.87]And then all of a sudden, the fucking sun wizard flies back against the fucking side of the sphere, disintegrates and explodes from the lightning coming out of the rain wizard's hands.
[246:22.29]And then it starts to rain in real life.
[246:39.59]Put that back in the box.
[246:57.68]What is this?
[247:02.14]What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[247:08.93]Oh, this is the makeup influencer.
[247:11.30]That's right.
[247:12.00]Okay, that's cool.
[247:12.80]I get it.
[247:13.92]That was the gaming influencer.
[247:15.28]This is the makeup influencer.
[247:16.71]Sorry, I was talking about wizards.
[247:45.11]There we go.
[247:51.65]Shoot.
[248:00.84]Wizard wrestling?
[248:05.52]Put it behind the webcam?
[248:28.51]Cool.
[248:31.96]Cool.
[248:35.82]Cool.
[248:38.22]Cool.
[249:00.29]Guys, I don't know how to design anything.
[249:01.97]I just know how to talk about, like, I know how to, like, make up wizards fighting in my head.
[249:05.21]I don't know how to do anything else.
[249:08.16]I could sit here and write, like, an hour, like, three or four hours, and have, like, three or four pages about, like, wizards fighting in the sphere, but I don't, I can't do, I can't fix this.
[249:15.89]I don't know how to do this.
[249:17.71]Sorry.
[249:18.91]Someone else will fix it.
[249:43.08]Get Lloyd on the sphere.
[249:44.54]I think that would actually work pretty well.
[249:51.83]I feel like that would work pretty well.
[249:52.99]It just says, this is Lloyd.
[249:55.09]Isn't he cool?
[249:56.51]And it's just a huge monitor lizard just hanging out, just kind of licking his face.
[250:00.12]I feel like people are like, wow, that's cool, that's cool.
[250:12.22]Nothing else to sell?
[250:16.10]What is in here?
[250:18.58]Desk?
[250:23.03]What about Otto?
[250:26.67]Uh, Otto... Uh... Otto could go on the sphere if he wanted to.
[250:48.59]I feel like the laptop, no.
[250:51.55]There's two different desks here.
[250:57.46]Dirty windows, oh shit.
[251:04.60]Can auto have a carrot when the stream ends?
[251:06.32]Absolutely.
[251:09.00]You better believe it.
[251:16.32]Makeup desk, computer desk.
[251:24.08]Yeah.
[251:25.82]So what's in these boxes then?
[251:33.31]Games?
[251:40.75]This is a gamer and makeup influencer?
[251:45.06]Multi-talented.
[252:06.05]I gotta move this stuff.
[252:15.04]Oh, it could be a couple.
[252:15.68]That's right, yeah.
[252:18.66]Just realize how big the bed is.
[252:36.99]Cool.
[252:44.96]The gamer corner.
[252:51.51]Nice.
[253:04.38]Babe, it's time for you to... It's time to game in the closet.
[253:16.57]Hey, you don't need very much space to game, I'll tell you.
[253:19.01]Hey, listen.
[253:24.65]All I needed... All I needed... Just give... Give me... Give me just like a fucking flashlight.
[253:32.46]I could do it.
[253:32.86]I could lie down.
[253:33.46]You could literally be in a tiny little spot.
[253:35.34]I could be under the blankets with a flashlight.
[253:37.68]Just sitting there in like a two, like a six inch space and I could game.
[253:42.88]Like Game Boy.
[253:45.18]You don't need very much space to game, especially with the Switch nowadays.
[253:48.03]And the, the, the stream upper decker.
[253:53.03]The steam upper decker.
[253:54.75]You know what I'm saying.
[254:00.01]Yeah, the stream upper decker.
[254:04.69]Welcome to the upper decker stream.
[254:10.64]I take a shit in the tank of my toilet.
[254:15.30]See you never, because I'm permanently going to be banned.
[254:17.74]I'm getting a shitload of fucking trouble.
[254:22.46]Remember when that person said that?
[254:29.54]It slayed me for like a week.
[254:37.78]I would just think about it all the time.
[254:39.16]It was just so stupid.
[254:40.16]So what's this one?
[254:52.96]There's a technology influencer, right?
[254:54.52]This place is dirty.
[255:06.91]Yeah, that's what it was.
[255:07.51]It was, are you getting the Steam upper decker?
[255:09.59]I remember that, that thing had just gotten announced.
[255:14.68]So, it was, people were still kind of confused at what it was.
[255:17.36]So, I just was like, wait, what is it?
[255:20.52]The Steam Deck?
[255:21.81]That's the deck, the valve deck or something?
[255:25.21]The upper deck, the upper, the upper decker.
[255:35.69]Sometimes you guys are very funny.
[255:37.97]Sometimes.
[255:38.63]That's all you're going to get from me.
[255:59.87]You spray the windows too?
[256:00.69]No.
[256:09.96]Did you get the OLED Steam Deck?
[256:12.00]No, I don't... I don't know if I have a use for it, honestly.
[256:14.58]I have a Switch already and I know that you can't... There's lots of stuff you can only do on a PC that aren't... will never come to Switch.
[256:26.64]But I can't... I don't really have a use for it.
[256:31.55]I have a Switch and anytime I want to do mobile gaming like that or mobile... It's the Switch.
[256:40.85]You could play Diablo II on it.
[256:43.53]Yeah, I mean, that's amazing.
[256:44.83]That's incredible.
[256:46.31]But I don't know if justifying getting a Steam Deck to play Diablo II on the toilet is a justifiable expense.
[256:59.45]I don't know if I could... I feel like playing Diablo II on the toilet today.
[257:03.25]Alright, well, thank God I have a Steam Deck.
[257:13.17]Trust me, I see the application.
[257:14.33]I've seen it.
[257:14.75]I've held it.
[257:15.71]I've looked at it.
[257:16.31]It is nice.
[257:18.71]It is really cool.
[257:28.72]It is very sleek.
[257:35.90]Oh, the vacuum cleaner.
[257:54.51]This is a very weird thing I'm doing right now.
[257:56.29]Why am I doing that?
[258:04.96]Okay, what are we doing in here?
[258:06.06]You want paint?
[258:07.36]No paint changes.
[258:08.47]Oh, yeah, there is.
[258:33.99]So it actually connects them right the right way.
[258:35.71]I was curious about that.
[258:38.27]If you go like this, like this, and then like that, will it connect these together?
[258:42.98]It does.
[258:44.32]That's cool.
[258:51.48]It treats it as one piece rather than he said it rather than a bunch of different multiple projects.
[259:17.57]Okay, I know I'm going to make a war in the chat that will never end.
[259:23.39]Ever.
[259:25.51]And a ton of you are going to become lifelong enemies with each other.
[259:30.48]But I've never seen One Piece.
[259:33.08]I've never seen Dragon Ball.
[259:36.02]They're both massive.
[259:38.64]They both are... There's like 40 years worth of content for both of them.
[259:46.13]Which one would you say I should do if I were to pick one?
[259:50.85]Let's see.
[259:56.59]I'm going to put the Dragon Ball.
[259:59.72]And that includes, by the way, like Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball.
[260:05.66]Dragon Ball Royale.
[260:08.20]Dragon Ball.
[260:09.76]Go for it.
[260:10.30]Dragon Ball.
[260:13.18]The weather wizards.
[260:15.02]With all the shit that they have.
[260:16.38]Oh, it's already active.
[260:32.63]I want to watch this live.
[260:33.53]Okay.
[260:33.79]49 to 51.
[260:36.79]This is going to be close.
[260:38.49]Wow.
[260:47.20]Wow.
[260:56.47]Good.
[260:56.77]This is going to... We might have... Honestly, we might have to do it again for like more than three minutes because this is 100% neck and neck.
[261:13.78]Guys, it won by two votes.
[261:15.94]You have to do it again.
[261:17.78]Do it again for three minutes.
[261:21.58]Two votes?
[261:22.72]That's it?
[261:31.53]We need more of a sample size then, because that's not definitive at all.
[261:57.42]Okay, hold on, let me see.
[261:58.32]Alright, this one's a little longer.
[262:02.88]We'll let this play off a little bit.
[262:04.72]This one's going to be longer.
[262:21.65]So much quicker.
[262:35.09]It's still separated by one vote.
[262:37.57]It was just 810 versus 809.
[262:39.75]908, 908.
[262:56.33]What?
[262:57.89]This seems like kind of impossible.
[262:59.93]Is somebody cheating this?
[263:00.67]Is somebody like botting this?
[263:03.85]Or is this just for real?
[263:12.02]WASD also moves the roller around too.
[263:21.63]Actually, great tip.
[263:24.41]That's a great tip.
[263:27.04]Holy shit, thank you.
[263:28.28]1070 to 1072.
[263:41.82]Those of you that are not participating, here's your time to shine.
[263:45.90]Because this is where your vote really is going to start counting here.
[263:58.19]Watch them both now.
[264:00.70]I don't have the time to watch them both.
[264:04.68]I don't have the time to watch one of them.
[264:08.13]Uh-oh.
[264:09.59]Uh-oh.
[264:10.23]One piece.
[264:11.31]One piece, friends.
[264:14.77]Ten people have decided that Dragon Ball is what I should do instead.
[264:19.26]Uh-oh.
[264:21.18]Nope.
[264:22.92]I just had to say... I had to speak those words out loud.
[264:27.16]You also have the power to choose neither.
[264:29.70]That is true.
[264:30.33]If you can't decide, then... Then I won't.
[264:42.69]Another corner.
[264:43.21]56 to 48.
[264:50.54]Eight votes.
[264:51.54]That's still not even definitive.
[264:54.42]Alright, well, I'm not watching either of them.
[265:04.69]I'll watch the four kids intro.
[265:07.79]And then go to bed.
[265:27.29]Watch Cowboy Bebop instead.
[265:28.53]I feel like everybody has seen Cowboy Bebop at some point.
[265:31.23]It's been a very, very, very long time, but I've seen it.
[265:48.67]Cool.
[265:53.29]I've seen Trigon.
[265:59.30]Very long time ago, but I've seen it.
[266:14.48]That dragon was great.
[266:17.61]Wasn't there something with Trigun, though, where... I remember... This is back when I just didn't get it.
[266:23.37]And I was just like, oh, this is a cartoon from Japan.
[266:27.56]Okay, cool.
[266:29.70]And it ended, but, like, I don't want to spoil anything, but, like, it wasn't... Like, they... It wasn't even close.
[266:37.36]Right?
[266:38.34]And I remember just being like, well, that was kind of fucking weird.
[266:41.65]Is that it?
[266:48.54]Oh, where's the rest of it?
[266:50.77]Was kind of like what I thought.
[266:52.83]I didn't like understand the whole concept behind, you know, manga and anime.
[266:58.21]And I was like, oh, it's from Japan.
[267:00.06]It's a cartoon.
[267:00.72]It's cool.
[267:02.12]It's based on a manga.
[267:03.58]That sounds fun.
[267:06.35]But I remember that was a thing, right?
[267:20.67]Just watch Jojo.
[267:21.47]I feel like the more that people say, watch Jojo, takes like four seconds away from my life of me actually watching Jojo.
[267:32.81]It's like, of the 10,000 times I've heard watch it,
[267:38.96]I said, people have a lot of opinions on that show, right?
[267:41.54]It's like, no, no, no, just, you could watch this one, but don't watch that one.
[267:44.42]Skip that one.
[267:45.04]This episode sucks.
[267:46.26]It gets really good here.
[267:47.90]But skip that season.
[267:49.50]This character's the best.
[267:50.76]Fuck that character.
[267:51.96]Start at season seven.
[267:57.07]It's funny, because I've actually seen some of, I think, the first handful of episodes, and it was like, oh, this is fucking kind of crazy.
[268:13.09]Watch episode 1, 7, and then... Skip season 1, LOL.
[268:18.25]See?
[268:18.51]I told you.
[268:19.35]I told you there's some people who do that.
[268:29.60]This one guy?
[268:30.26]Season 1 is the best season.
[268:38.95]I would probably really like it.
[268:40.07]It seems kind of right up my alley.
[268:46.64]There's a lot of things to do.
[268:47.76]A lot of TVs to watch.
[268:49.04]A lot of games to play.
[268:50.14]A lot of work to do.
[268:54.75]I'm just happy that there's a ton of fucking media that exists that I could just watch at any point forever for the rest of my life.
[269:00.43]Guys, I don't know.
[269:00.87]When I'm like 90, I might tweet, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the best fucking show I've ever seen in my life.
[269:09.04]So glad I waited.
[269:10.46]Save the best for last.
[269:13.12]And then it's declared that I died an hour later.
[269:26.56]I got plenty of time.
[269:27.34]I'll be good.
[269:43.34]He died before the finale.
[269:49.14]We can't confirm, unfortunately.
[269:50.98]Jerma985 has died.
[269:53.14]But he missed the last 15 minutes of the series finale.
[270:02.75]We filled his body with cocaine.
[270:05.17]He said he demanded it to make sure he could stay alive to see it.
[270:09.43]Unfortunately, the doctors did not allow that at the hospital.
[270:26.51]Acknowledge the wallpaper?
[270:30.19]Sometimes you make a mistake, it's fine.
[270:41.12]It's got character.
[270:47.86]Do something about it.
[270:50.10]Can I?
[270:50.50]I don't know how to fix that.
[270:55.79]I'll fix it.
[270:58.76]What is this?
[271:00.49]Duplicate tool, right?
[271:03.71]This right here.
[271:04.53]Can I duplicate this?
[271:05.99]I don't know.
[271:06.41]What pattern is this?
[271:07.13]Do you have any constructive criticism for this game?
[271:15.18]I missed the before and after.
[271:16.56]I think that's really the only thing.
[271:18.92]I missed the before and after photos.
[271:20.24]I don't know if they're in the game, but I haven't seen them yet.
[271:24.50]Press R.
[271:28.11]Oh, there we go.
[271:28.79]Duplicate.
[271:29.27]Can I?
[271:29.55]But I can't.
[271:29.89]I don't think you can duplicate a wall.
[271:36.25]That's also kind of reaching, though, because I think it's great.
[271:43.58]I'm looking forward to making the Willy Wonka Choose Your Own Adventure Frank Sucks house.
[271:48.98]Copy style?
[272:03.04]Ah, that's actually really helpful.
[272:09.44]I get out of here and don't come back.
[272:42.91]Screw you, man.
[272:43.95]Hey, I'm just having fun with you.
[272:47.38]Just messing around.
[272:54.12]You're such a little scoundrel, I know.
[272:58.17]I can be.
[273:01.35]Wall decor.
[273:02.11]There.
[273:05.00]There.
[273:13.21]You didn't even fix it?
[273:19.21]What the fuck is this?
[273:26.10]What did I do?
[273:26.66]I got the wrong... You made it worse.
[273:32.00]Alright, I'll fix it.
[273:33.63]Fine.
[273:34.89]Everybody just needs to relax.
[274:04.70]We're calm.
[274:05.98]I'm very calm.
[274:14.81]Work smarter, not harder.
[274:16.17]That's right.
[274:30.87]Nice.
[274:31.15]I must have three stars.
[274:31.97]Damn.
[274:32.13]I wasn't even paying attention.
[274:35.01]You did the right thing.
[274:35.92]Thank you.
[274:36.98]Thank you, one guy.
[274:44.97]This is a neat little lamp.
[274:47.57]I think you get an interesting shadow from that, though.
[274:52.83]Make sure I can keep my feet nice and toasty.
[275:16.04]Hmm.
[275:20.43]Much better.
[275:23.41]I'll be honest.
[275:24.17]I think this might be my favorite room.
[275:26.19]I actually kind of really like this.
[275:31.03]This is my favorite color scheme, by the way.
[275:32.88]That kind of like browns, kind of blues, oranges, yellows.
[275:38.78]This is my favorite color scheme.
[275:43.34]Beaverberry?
[275:43.94]Yep.
[275:50.70]So what's left?
[275:51.26]Just kind of little kind of incidental things?
[275:55.77]Oh, outside.
[275:56.33]15 items to buy out here.
[276:02.70]It's all plants, I see.
[276:23.55]Ooh.
[276:23.89]I gotta buy it.
[276:39.17]I want the green over on this one.
[277:10.74]This thing is weird.
[277:18.42]Zoil?
[277:21.65]What's going on, Zoil?
[277:22.55]Thanks for the raid.
[277:24.49]What's up, everybody?
[277:26.15]Thanks, Zoil.
[277:30.85]What's up?
[277:33.25]Hope you're doing good.
[277:35.09]What are you guys doing?
[277:35.73]What are you guys up to?
[277:47.69]Yeah, thanks, Zoil, for the raid.
[277:48.67]Welcome.
[277:49.90]We're playing House Flipper.
[277:51.50]I just got three stars on the hardest mission in the game.
[277:54.74]And I believe I'm one of the only people on the leaderboard.
[278:00.92]I am up there high on the leaderboard.
[278:02.96]Would you like to see?
[278:04.22]Should we give Zoil and Zoil's community a tour?
[278:09.28]First of all, take a look at this.
[278:12.54]Whoa.
[278:15.10]I mean, you should have seen what this place looked like before.
[278:20.86]I didn't have a template.
[278:21.78]I did this all from scratch.
[278:24.03]This is not one of the missions in the game that lets you just paint the walls and move furniture around.
[278:30.19]It is.
[278:30.41]I'm sorry.
[278:32.88]I didn't put that up.
[278:33.56]Somebody else did.
[278:39.44]No one's going to see it.
[278:45.95]Oh, cool.
[278:46.47]Alright, so I'm done.
[278:47.67]I got it.
[278:49.29]I want to do an assembly quest.
[278:50.68]Bad.
[278:51.04]30 grand?
[279:03.30]That was a nice tour.
[279:04.33]Fuck, I forgot.
[279:05.95]I showed one wall of one room.
[279:11.47]Hey, Zoil!
[279:12.73]Ah, yeah, and everybody from Zoil's chat!
[279:15.17]I'm gonna give you a tour!
[279:16.55]Here's a wall and a live laugh love joke.
[279:19.03]Bye!
[279:20.43]What the fuck was that?
[279:21.71]Alright, come on.
[279:23.96]Everybody pray for an assembly.
[279:36.21]Let me clean this place up a little, too.
[279:38.92]So this is my house.
[279:40.88]I know, look, everyone's going to be like, what the heck?
[279:43.38]It looks like it looks like it looks like it stinks.
[279:46.77]I don't swear.
[279:47.37]We don't swear here.
[279:51.39]And by the way, saying like stink or stinker or like butthead is grounds for a timeout.
[279:57.58]So Zoil in your community, I just want to make sure you know.
[280:00.24]If you call somebody like a butthead, it's just... I'm only saying it just for reference because like don't say that stuff here.
[280:07.29]If you call somebody like a stinker, you're going to get a timeout.
[280:19.76]How clean is the outside here?
[280:20.80]Alright.
[280:44.11]Is this trash?
[280:45.23]It is.
[280:45.53]What was it?
[280:45.89]Was it a sandwich?
[280:50.56]Yeah, it's House Flipper 2, sequel to House Flipper 1, currently sponsored to play.
[280:55.98]We just did our big House Flipper Invitational, which was some of the most fun I've had all year.
[281:03.07]I mean it.
[281:03.77]That was a great time.
[281:04.87]I don't want to sell these.
[281:08.64]These are fine.
[281:20.89]The outside needs a lot of work.
[281:22.35]If this is actually going to be where I live, I need to... Hmm.
[281:34.66]AutoMod is actually stopping most of the butthead messages.
[281:41.10]Yeah, as it should.
[281:44.02]Why are we talking like that's a surprise?
[282:00.11]Alright, this is kind of the garage, huh?
[282:14.62]What's that say?
[282:15.82]Sorry about trash.
[282:21.42]Alright, 156,000.
[282:28.02]I feel like I don't deserve $40,000 or $50,000 of this because it was a bug.
[282:31.80]So I think I'm going to buy a pool for my neighbor.
[282:34.79]You know what I mean?
[282:36.41]Like, hey, neighbor.
[282:37.47]Yeah, he's got a brand new in-ground pool.
[282:40.01]It was $40,000.
[282:40.41]Just put it right here.
[282:41.69]Do you care?
[282:44.63]I feel like I don't deserve that money because I cheated.
[282:53.12]Sell your neighbor's stuff.
[282:54.42]I don't think you can.
[282:56.34]No, you cannot.
[283:01.02]I like that stump.
[283:04.72]Some of this stuff needs to go.
[283:08.23]The roof isn't going to fall down, right?
[283:20.53]He's deleting support beams.
[283:26.68]Uh oh.
[283:32.74]What was the theory of this room?
[283:34.46]I don't even remember.
[283:35.26]Anymore trash.
[283:51.41]Your philosophy is going down.
[283:52.87]Alright, save it for the Willy Wonka rooms.
[284:06.69]Dead plants.
[284:08.15]Yeah.
[284:08.33]Just want to get rid of stuff that's run down looking, right?
[284:14.35]These paintings.
[284:17.49]This is alright.
[284:19.17]It's okay.
[284:24.29]Oh boy.
[284:24.59]Oh my goodness.
[284:30.76]What the hell is happening in here?
[284:42.78]Can you just repaint it?
[284:44.04]Yeah, you can.
[284:44.44]I just want to clean up.
[284:51.26]Probably getting close to the end of the stream too.
[284:53.44]I want to go for about five hours today.
[284:54.66]Somewhere between three and five.
[284:57.22]So I'm going to clean up these next couple of rooms and I'm probably going to get lunch.
[285:10.93]But this has been great.
[285:19.67]House flip or two.
[285:20.55]I forget the invitational things like three days ago.
[285:25.96]There's a lot.
[285:27.90]There's a lot of cool stuff going on.
[285:29.14]Alright, clean enough.
[285:34.40]No, it's not.
[285:39.80]Yeah, I keep an eye on the sus.
[285:41.94]If I do stream again, it will be before before Christmas.
[285:48.31]And if I do stream again, I'm not sure what it will be.
[285:50.47]I might.
[285:52.33]I don't know, guys.
[285:53.34]I might just come back with the Willy Wonka house in like six days or something.
[285:57.24]That might be the way to send this off to like the new year.
[286:01.90]Depends on how much time I put into it, because I got a lot of work to do.
[286:05.30]But it's very possible that I will come back before Christmas.
[286:11.02]And it would be a pretty quick stream.
[286:13.78]It would just be kind of like, hey, let's spend like 40 minutes doing this thing that I was making.
[286:20.09]And then I'd probably go away.
[286:21.13]I'd probably disappear for like two or three weeks.
[286:25.59]Doing stuff, working.
[286:27.21]You'd probably see me again like a couple weeks later.
[286:32.52]That makes more sense to me than waiting till like three weeks from now to show it.
[286:39.40]So plan on like some point before Christmas that I'll be back with the Willy Wonka house.
[286:44.98]Or maybe even like, I don't know, maybe in a day or two after Christmas, maybe.
[286:48.04]No, I'm going to be, I'll be gone, won't I?
[286:49.78]I gotta look at my like, like travel schedule.
[286:54.21]I'm not sure where I'm going and where I'm going first.
[286:57.71]I'm trying to think of like where, where I need to go.
[287:01.89]This is not dirty, by the way.
[287:08.02]He retired again.
[287:09.22]What the fuck?
[287:12.10]Yeah, retiring means he's not streaming for two weeks.
[287:16.62]Oh, man.
[287:17.12]This is like the fifth retirement in the last two months, dude.
[287:21.61]What the fuck?
[287:29.69]Peace on Earth.
[287:30.51]Hey, thanks.
[287:32.89]I agree.
[287:36.74]But yeah, same philosophy, still there.
[287:39.48]But yeah, Hellslipper 2 came out.
[287:41.52]You knew I was going to be on this.
[287:44.14]And I got a sponsor, so that's awesome.
[287:46.10]And I'm shocked that that's a reality, but that's really cool.
[287:49.91]But I'll call it here.
[287:50.47]That sounds good to me.
[287:52.89]Save it.
[287:54.73]So keep an eye on the sauce.
[287:55.91]We'll probably do our Choose Your Own Adventure house at some point in the near future.
[288:05.21]I will give Otto a carrot, I promise.
[288:09.63]Yeah.
[288:10.72]See you in the next, like, seven to ten days.
[288:14.82]And then after that, see you probably a couple weeks later.
[288:17.06]Two or three weeks, probably.
