[00:00.23]Hey, look at him.
[00:00.67]You know all these guys like John Cena, The Miz, Sasha Banks?
[00:05.69]None of these fucking people are gonna be in this video.
[00:08.81]Not one person on the screen right now.
[00:10.39]Do you see Shane McMahon do his funny little dance?
[00:12.50]He's not in this.
[00:14.12]None of them are.
[00:16.00]So let's welcome our first... Let's welcome the chairman of the Jerma Wrestling Federation.
[00:19.76]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... ...Jerma985 to the stage.
[00:28.12]I don't know what he's going to be doing.
[00:29.18]I'm not sure what the hell he's doing here.
[00:31.91]Something tells me he's got something to say.
[00:34.53]Even though I did not program any dialog.
[00:38.37]We're coming from North Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:43.27]What?
[00:44.69]I didn't pick that city.
[00:49.11]Okay, I don't know.
[00:51.54]Oh, shit!
[00:52.76]Don't look!
[00:53.32]Don't look!
[00:53.84]Please welcome, Jerma985.
[00:57.59]Oh, he's going to swing at somebody in the audience.
[00:59.17]He's not happy.
[01:03.40]Making his way up to the ring right now.
[01:06.52]Who knows what he could say.
[01:07.62]This is the first, first ever streamed, streaming Jermania.
[01:14.93]He very easily got it.
[01:16.13]What is wrong with his face?
[01:16.87]He's got like light rays coming off the side of his mouth.
[01:22.15]What the fuck?
[01:22.87]Trust me, I would be angry too if I lived in a mud hole of a city like this one.
[01:27.03]But unlike all of you, I tried doing something about my bad luck.
[01:30.79]I begged the bosses to let me slip to skip this show.
[01:33.81]But of course, leaving me out is most definitely not best for business.
[01:37.53]So take your photographs now because I promise once I'm out of this ring, I'll be on my jet out of this hell hole.
[01:43.88]What am I supposed to do?
[01:50.76]I don't have a good performance?
[01:56.84]Some guys come out and talk about how great they are.
[01:59.56]Some talk about how they're overlooked.
[02:01.46]I don't care about either.
[02:03.15]I just want to main event the next pay-per-view, cool?
[02:06.89]I wasn't really asking you.
[02:08.67]I was just telling you to be cool with it because that's how it's going down.
[02:14.29]This is fucking stupid.
[02:19.82]Do people like me yet?
[02:22.68]Yeah, I don't really care what anyone in the back has to say about it.
[02:25.52]I care about the authority.
[02:27.49]If they approve, I'm all good.
[02:29.89]And I have no doubts that they'll approve, baby.
[02:31.95]You know what I'm saying?
[02:36.79]This is fucking stupid.
[02:37.75]Why do they even put this shit in?
[02:40.19]Well, that's that.
[02:40.91]I've said my piece.
[02:41.71]The actions will start rolling into motion.
[02:43.27]And once the universe knows you want to do something, it happens.
[02:46.42]Not the WWF.
[02:48.74]Idiots.
[02:49.92]The actual thing that matters.
[02:51.52]Good night.
[02:52.62]Okay, bye.
[02:53.06]I'm leaving the ring now.
[03:00.65]The first match of the evening is going to be a Tornado Tag Extreme Rules match between Team Sorcery, Flanker and the Anor Lander versus Team Sub Sound, Orson Welles and Paul Bearer.
[03:14.62]Here comes Flanker.
[03:17.44]Make sure you follow him, at Flanker.
[03:20.36]This game does this weird thing where if you make some... Oh yeah, I forgot.
[03:23.74]The Archmage is trying to control his mind.
[03:26.84]He's trying to make sure he stays with it.
[03:29.56]Going to the crown, making sure he says hello.
[03:31.83]The Archmage is trying to take control of him and he's trying to force him out.
[03:34.15]He's keeping his cool.
[03:37.49]As Flanker gets into the ring.
[03:39.09]This is Tornado Tag, by the way.
[03:42.04]There is no tagging in.
[03:43.26]They're just all in the ring at the same time.
[03:44.67]And it's Extreme Rules.
[03:46.81]So you could see tables.
[03:49.09]You could see kendo sticks.
[03:50.49]You could see a chair.
[03:53.57]As Flanker makes his way into the ring for the first time ever.
[03:56.46]Oh, wait.
[03:57.30]By the way, here comes the Anor Lander, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:59.84]All the way from Anor Land.
[04:01.82]He's got some type of material in his hand.
[04:04.13]He is a sorcerer.
[04:06.62]I'm not sure what he just... That might have just been... I don't know if that... He might have had a Galehorn.
[04:10.76]I'm not sure what that was.
[04:11.54]That was Huff, maybe?
[04:12.76]Nip?
[04:13.34]Niff?
[04:13.86]I'm not sure.
[04:15.78]He can cast those spells, and he's very good at it.
[04:18.74]As he makes his way down to the arena.
[04:20.70]For the first time ever.
[04:21.54]The Aniland.
[04:22.96]Can't fit the R. No R. I want to make sure you saw that shit.
[04:31.99]Okay, now we're going to go on to the next two.
[04:35.15]I think we can just hit start here.
[04:36.53]What the hell?
[04:36.93]I'm not sure what he even does here.
[04:38.01]I don't think he does anything.
[04:40.08]No, he just stares.
[04:41.42]Alright, let's bring in the next two.
[04:44.60]Fog.
[04:45.56]As they're both in the ring.
[04:47.32]Very highly seated competitors.
[04:50.74]And now here currently... Here comes... This is Orson Welles.
[04:57.37]I don't know why I picked this for an entrance.
[04:59.83]I don't know why he has a cut on his nose.
[05:07.64]Such a shitty Orson Welles.
[05:09.16]I must have been, like, drunk, like I said.
[05:12.18]He's just staring into the ring.
[05:18.01]From the grave.
[05:20.39]Why does he have a huge cut on his nose, huh?
[05:22.67]Did I do that?
[05:27.55]Why is he walking so slow?
[05:29.01]Alright, we're going on the Fall Bearer.
[05:32.88]Here comes Fall Bearer!
[05:35.54]The classic!
[05:43.48]If you want to know the secret to this pallbearer
[06:03.25]This somebody like took a picture of Paul Bearer's face and like put it on and you can like download it So I like downloaded this like guys Paul Bearer because he has like a good picture Alright, alright, let's go let's go
[06:27.79]And that's going to be it.
[06:29.07]Let's get it going here.
[06:30.25]Tornado tag subsounds versus Team Sorcery.
[06:33.81]Referee's going to ring that bell, and here we go.
[06:36.12]Make sure to hashtag raw.
[06:38.40]As the antelander... The antelander wasting no time.
[06:44.00]Multiple punches into Orson Welles' face.
[06:46.12]Well, Paul...
[06:50.93]It's so hard to do this.
[06:52.41]It's too funny.
[06:54.13]Remember, this is an Extreme Rules match.
[06:57.17]So... If you're curious... Extreme Rules... I can't get over fucking Paul Bearer.
[07:08.21]Looks like he's got him in a suplex.
[07:09.37]Yeah, this is a pretty good suplex.
[07:12.82]Ooh, big overhead press there by Flanker onto Paul Bearer.
[07:16.20]Who now has him by the head, punching him right in his ear.
[07:19.18]It was pretty devastating.
[07:20.08]Well, now Orson Welles, the Antelander with a big elbow right against the ropes into his mouth.
[07:24.98]This has really turned it.
[07:25.94]It seems, ooh, a big stomp there onto the Antelander's face.
[07:30.20]You would think that they would try to double-team on something, like throw somebody out of the ring and double-team one of the other competitors.
[07:36.40]Well, Paul Bearer has not done one single move.
[07:39.61]He's getting both of his ears pulled, like a mother pulling their son in from, like, it's time for dinner.
[07:45.06]He just gets reversed, now wait a minute, where's he going?
[07:47.60]Anilander looks like he's going on the top ropes!
[07:49.96]We might see some high flying action here!
[07:52.75]Oh baby!
[07:53.71]He just completely... Wait, he's getting a pinfall!
[08:01.83]He just went for a pin on Paul Bear, you have to win with a pin.
[08:07.44]Ooh, big clothesline by the Anilander onto Orson Welles.
[08:10.96]Now he's going for the Vulcan Stretch!
[08:15.64]Yeah, and Paul Bearer still has not done a single thing.
[08:17.92]Just do anything?
[08:19.34]I feel bad for Paul Bearer.
[08:21.06]He's done nothing.
[08:21.94]Now he's going to be... He's getting in like a cobra clutch now.
[08:25.18]Orson Welles first to go to the outside.
[08:26.90]What's he doing out here?
[08:27.68]I'm not sure he's potentially going underneath the ring.
[08:33.33]Extreme rules, but that leaves Flanker and the... Oh, Anorlander's coming outside.
[08:36.79]Now here comes a ladder.
[08:38.89]It looks like he's going to get brought into the ring.
[08:40.43]No, he wasn't paying attention.
[08:41.95]Wasn't looking behind him for some reason.
[08:45.43]No, he's going to toss him over his back.
[08:48.57]Maybe we'll get that ladder and that ring.
[08:51.45]And see, no, he's going to grab him by his head and squeeze his head.
[08:55.84]Why do so many people do the head squeeze move?
[08:58.06]I don't know.
[09:00.30]Oh, big right hand there.
[09:01.52]Oh, and here comes Paul Faraday taunting for no reason.
[09:06.38]He's going to get thrown...
[09:14.23]He gets his face pushed into the table.
[09:24.40]He takes a huge haymaker and completely misses Flanker.
[09:27.20]And he gets kicked right in the spleen.
[09:34.35]Oh no, going for the wishbone, there it gets it.
[09:37.23]Nobody's in the frame.
[09:41.33]Uh...
[09:42.26]Oh, there we go!
[09:42.82]Throwback in the ring!
[09:43.66]Paul Bearer throws Flanker back into the ring while Orson Welles is getting multiple hits.
[09:48.10]Now he gets clotheslined for his trouble.
[09:50.96]Now into the corner goes Flanker.
[09:52.60]Now remember, somebody just has to get pinned.
[09:55.36]Well, Orson Welles is... Destroy him!
[10:02.02]What the fuck was that?
[10:05.86]He got the ladder, but he's not using it.
[10:10.58]Both pairs go for a pin!
[10:12.86]Got a two count on flanker in the ring.
[10:14.83]And this is still going outside.
[10:19.69]The commentators, strangely enough, we're watching this from a distance.
[10:24.92]It's anybody's game, but the worst situation right now is somebody in the ring has a huge... Paul Bearer has a huge advantage right now.
[10:32.00]If he can somehow... No, he's going to throw him into the corner through the ropes.
[10:36.88]What is he doing?
[10:38.20]Orson Welles is doing push-ups on top of Anilander, trying to show a little bit of dominance, I think, there.
[10:43.35]And we could see a double-team.
[10:44.79]Anilander is out cold in the corner.
[10:47.65]Well, Flanker now gets picked up by Orson Welles, thrown down on his ass.
[10:51.29]And this is... Double-team him.
[10:52.65]Don't go back outside.
[10:53.53]What are you thinking?
[10:55.24]Orson's got him in the air.
[10:56.40]Another spin.
[10:57.76]No, he rolled over his body.
[10:59.32]That might have been a potential finishing move.
[11:03.57]Well, the Anor Lander now has got big scoop slam.
[11:06.15]No, reversal by Flanker.
[11:08.15]Wait a minute.
[11:09.13]Wait a minute.
[11:09.53]There's one.
[11:10.45]There's two.
[11:10.91]No, just a two count.
[11:12.33]Just a two count on Paul Bear from the Anor Lander, who is, I would assume, is doing pretty badly.
[11:19.40]I don't know.
[11:19.94]He punched the air and missed.
[11:22.53]Something to note.
[11:23.90]This is very important.
[11:27.00]Nobody has gotten a weapon and actually used it.
[11:28.98]But Flanker seems to have one now.
[11:30.70]And then Paul Bearer... Orson Welles catches the chair in mid-air.
[11:38.35]Extreme... Paul Bearer is bleeding.
[11:44.28]Oh, that's it.
[11:45.22]That's it.
[11:45.58]That's his finishing move.
[11:46.78]That was the zap.
[11:47.94]That's going to be it.
[11:49.10]One, two.
[11:51.34]No.
[11:52.08]Orson Welles just barely kicks out of the zap.
[11:54.72]I can't believe it.
[11:55.42]That's his finishing move.
[11:57.66]You have to have so much perseverance to get out of that.
[12:01.03]That was his finisher.
[12:05.39]And the tides have turned.
[12:08.54]The tides have turned.
[12:09.67]Now Orson Welles and Paul Bearer seem to have an upper hand and Paul Bearer got accidentally kicked in the face.
[12:15.75]I'm not sure that's going to do it.
[12:17.69]It can't be doing it.
[12:18.33]That's 1-2.
[12:18.77]No, not even close.
[12:19.79]I am in shock right now.
[12:23.03]There's no way that the Ambulander could actually have caught... What are they doing?
[12:28.86]Okay, they both were just... Okay, that's... He's getting pinned now?
[12:32.76]Paul Bearer is now sleeping in the corner.
[12:34.92]They both were testing each other to see who was going to do an elbow drop first.
[12:38.53]And now Orson Welles has him up.
[12:40.01]This could be the French Champagne!
[12:41.61]No, no, not really.
[12:43.23]That was just another one.
[12:44.25]Oh, Flaker's mask almost came off.
[12:48.31]Why is Flaker bleeding so much?
[12:56.35]Nobody has used a weapon.
[12:58.59]Finally, Flaker picks the weapon up again.
[13:00.39]And this time he gets it.
[13:02.51]That's a chair shot right into the chest.
[13:04.78]Well, wait a minute, Paul.
[13:07.73]Why would you leave?
[13:08.66]He wants another weapon?
[13:12.16]I'm not sure I understand here.
[13:13.40]I think he's going to get another weapon.
[13:15.70]I don't think he'd need it.
[13:18.08]Because he's leaving his partner in the rim.
[13:19.54]That's a kendo stick.
[13:21.67]All it takes is one big shot from this and... No, he...
[13:28.91]With a second counter a second counter on a weapon and this time he makes him pay for it And now he's got him in a suplex.
[13:38.95]That's a pinning suplex.
[13:40.11]We got two pins here one two
[13:44.29]Oh, that was, no, that would have been three.
[13:46.01]That would have been three.
[13:46.77]Paul Bearer has been pinning Annalander the entire time.
[13:49.78]And now we're finally going to get a pin.
[13:50.88]One, two, three.
[13:52.76]That's it.
[13:53.50]He was on the ground for so long.
[13:57.26]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the first match of the evening.
[14:02.56]The subsounds, Paul Bearer and Orson Welles.
[14:12.33]He's got the theme song.
[14:13.57]Here it is.
[14:14.37]This replay means nothing.
[14:16.51]Because he kicked out of this.
[14:19.23]This also means nothing.
[14:21.91]I'm not sure why they showed that.
[14:23.28]And here's another pin that meant nothing.
[14:25.64]In case you want to watch another pin that means nothing.
[14:28.02]Hey, remember when they tried to pin each other like five times?
[14:32.38]But that's it ladies and gentlemen.
[14:33.48]Thank you for watching the first match.
[14:40.39]The subsounds have taken the victory over sorcery.
[14:44.61]And we are going to move on to the next... I think this is another promo.
[14:53.64]Orson Welles, the two subsounds celebrating in the ring.
[14:58.42]A weapon was used once.
[14:59.38]Paul Vera still bleeding.
[15:02.07]And that's a big handshake there.
[15:03.73]You can tell they're going to be going places here in this federation.
[15:08.35]They played their heart out.
[15:10.49]Paul Bearer especially took a bunch of heat in the very beginning.
[15:14.49]But did you see that?
[15:15.27]Look at that bloodied face.
[15:18.04]Seems that jermaMoon might have something he wants to do here.
[15:22.26]As he comes out to the arena.
[15:25.48]I wasn't aware that jermaMoon could even talk.
[15:28.54]I wasn't sure about that.
[15:30.76]As he slowly is going to get in the ring.
[15:35.24]And find a... Find somehow to talk.
[15:37.86]I mean, apparently he's gonna try to talk through his... Through his fae.
[15:43.41]I don't... I have no idea.
[15:45.19]It's gonna be like a performance thing, isn't it?
[15:48.51]Hey, yeah, I'm the moon.
[15:50.15]Yeah, you all think I'm just gonna talk about how I'm the greatest, right?
[15:52.89]Well, I am the greatest.
[15:54.35]But that's not why I'm here.
[15:55.81]I'm here to call out a certain superstar named Mr. Sneakman.
[15:59.49]He's gonna want to hear me out.
[16:03.97]Well, these are so... Look, coming out from the side of the ring, it's Mr. Sneakman.
[16:09.08]Not wearing his cape right now, but I'm not sure what Mr. Sneakman's going to have to... I'm not sure what they're doing here.
[16:14.40]Truman Moon wants to talk to Mr. Sneakman for some reason.
[16:20.52]I'm not sure what it's going to be about, but... It's anybody's guess as to what these two could be talking about in the ring.
[16:27.69]Let's let him get out here.
[16:28.77]He's calling him out.
[16:37.68]It's just so long to get in the ring.
[16:42.23]Did he lose weight?
[16:43.01]You can't make him like a freak.
[16:45.35]He seems to be talking to somebody in the audience.
[16:50.37]As he gets in, he still has his microphone.
[16:53.20]Chairman Moon is significantly taller.
[16:56.56]Look, he's got the camera now.
[16:57.48]He's gonna... Yeah, you want to see me?
[17:00.08]I'm here.
[17:00.38]Now skip the presentries.
[17:01.47]Get to where you want.
[17:06.27]I think you and I complement each other well.
[17:08.39]We're like chocolate and peanut butter.
[17:10.35]Apart.
[17:10.85]Whatever.
[17:11.15]We're fine.
[17:11.63]Great.
[17:12.99]We can be amazing.
[17:13.93]So let's make this happen.
[17:14.81]Let's form a tag team.
[17:17.63]What?
[17:17.89]We're going to potentially see a tag team here?
[17:19.81]An unhealthy alliance?
[17:21.95]Yes, I like that.
[17:22.81]We're going to be a tag team.
[17:24.63]So it seems like Mr. Sneakman and jermaMoon are going to be a potential tag team here.
[17:32.32]Yeah, yeah.
[17:33.48]We're going to be tag team partners, don't you know?
[17:36.76]Yeah, yeah.
[17:38.00]Alright!
[17:39.38]This is the promo results screen.
[17:42.20]Okay.
[17:45.08]The promo meter.
[17:47.04]You want to promo... Alright, well, just... Mr. Sneakman and jermaMoon are now going to be partners in crime.
[17:56.42]For some reason.
[17:57.54]The cell.
[17:59.02]The Hell in a Cell.
[18:00.15]And for some reason, I'm not sure why, the Air Serpent...
[18:03.61]is the Intercontinental Champion of the Jerma Wrestling Federation.
[18:07.32]I don't know how that happened.
[18:09.00]This is a six-man Hell in a Cell.
[18:10.44]The first contestant is the Air Serpent from Sorcery as he makes his way down to the arena.
[18:16.56]Remember the Hell in a Cell.
[18:17.60]Once that gate comes down, once that closes, there's no getting out.
[18:23.94]So who are the six competitors potentially that are going to be locked in this place showing off the belt off there?
[18:32.57]That is the Air Serpent.
[18:33.59]He is the current champion.
[18:35.81]Which was an accident.
[18:37.73]I just think I randomly gave it to one person.
[18:41.50]As the Air Serpent is showing now, he's in the ring.
[18:43.98]We're gonna get the next competitor coming in.
[18:45.42]Who's the next one to come down?
[18:48.22]The second contestant of the Hell in a Cell out of six.
[18:53.60]Could you have guessed who it was gonna be?
[18:57.89]That's right, it's the Earth Serpent!
[19:00.49]The second of the serpents from Sorcery, the Earth Serpent.
[19:05.86]Flexing, trying to show his muscle.
[19:07.38]He's got a great flower pattern all over him.
[19:10.18]Earth Serpent making his way down as we speak.
[19:13.96]He's not currently a champion.
[19:16.92]But he's kind of like the chocolate bunny.
[19:20.45]Earth Serpent.
[19:23.91]Here he comes.
[19:24.93]And hey, could you guess who the next contestant is going to be?
[19:32.94]As they await the arrival of... Of... Of... That's right, the Fire Serpent!
[19:46.05]The third serpent in Sorcery Part 3!
[19:48.85]Hiding in the backlands, Jerma took all these serpents out, if you remember.
[19:54.35]Fire Serpent was particularly easy.
[19:57.77]Here comes the Fire Serpent pointing into the ring now, telling the other serpents that he is the best serpent in all of sorcery.
[20:04.57]Which you might agree with.
[20:07.87]If you were an agreeable person.
[20:11.24]Nobody saw it coming.
[20:12.06]Nobody thought there was gonna be six serpents.
[20:14.10]And you're probably wondering, why would there be six serpents in the ring at the same time and not seven?
[20:20.10]Well, that's because Jerma never killed the Sun Serpent.
[20:23.00]So he's not allowed in.
[20:25.67]As we bring up the next competitor, it's got another serpent!
[20:32.55]What other serpents do we have left?
[20:36.17]We have fire, Earth, air, and here comes the moon serpent!
[20:41.87]There he is!
[20:43.34]Clapping, he's getting ready, he's so excited for this!
[20:45.68]You can see the moon dust emanating from his fingertips.
[20:48.16]The moon serpent is the number four!
[20:51.30]And you've got to remember guys,
[20:54.03]Moon Serpent probably has an edge.
[20:56.64]If I were to take a guess, I'd say I would put my money on the Moon Serpent.
[21:05.10]Dust Serpent.
[21:06.64]Here comes the Moon Serpent.
[21:07.70]Moon Serpent is now making his way in.
[21:09.35]Number five.
[21:12.79]One of the more terrifying adversaries in all of sorcery, Steve Jackson's sorcery, was none other than the Time Serpent.
[21:21.55]If you remember, he called himself Death.
[21:23.63]He called himself... Eradication.
[21:27.36]And here he is right now.
[21:30.12]Or you could mistake him for Venom from Spider-Man.
[21:35.26]Look at that lady!
[21:36.08]Let me get a picture of the Time Serpent!
[21:40.28]It's the Time Serpent!
[21:44.23]Extremely dangerous.
[21:46.75]Unkillable.
[21:49.17]In a way.
[21:49.63]And his stats will show that.
[21:53.40]As he methodically makes his way down to the ring.
[21:56.30]Terrifying stuff.
[21:58.54]Took Jerma a pretty long time to figure out how to beat the Time Serpent.
[22:05.52]Somebody use the beacons.
[22:09.72]And the final Serpent to come in for the six-man Hell in a Cell Serpent battle to see who the best Serpent is.
[22:20.15]He's gonna be.
[22:23.52]The water serpent.
[22:27.34]With his fish logo on his chest.
[22:30.76]If that's what you didn't know what it was, that's it.
[22:32.32]And for some reason they have like bunny costumes on.
[22:35.46]Here you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:37.77]Please vote on who you think is going to win the battle of the serpents.
[22:46.19]The serpent battle is about to go underway.
[22:49.45]Vote there if you'd like.
[22:53.37]And here we go.
[22:55.41]As the match progresses, we will get excessively more dangerous, I would assume.
[22:59.69]But these guys are all huge.
[23:01.09]They're all at least 7'5".
[23:04.10]The Six Serpents of Mampang!
[23:07.00]And immediately the Time Serpent wastes no time.
[23:10.32]The Air Serpent gets thrown out of the ring.
[23:13.12]Somebody already has a chair.
[23:16.00]The Time Serpent already had a chair.
[23:17.20]He must have already got the chair in a different time frame.
[23:20.62]As the Water Serpent is picking up the... No, he's gonna...
[23:23.31]He's got him picked up.
[23:24.03]The air serpent now going down on the ground.
[23:26.97]This is just a pin.
[23:28.17]Remember, it's just a pin.
[23:30.61]Whoever gets a pin off, which I'm not sure how it's going to be possible.
[23:33.41]Somebody's going to get pinned by the Earth serpent.
[23:35.85]Really taking it on the back of the time serpent.
[23:38.57]Well, I think the fire serpent just broke the murder serpent's neck.
[23:42.25]He just snapped his neck.
[23:48.21]He's going to do it again.
[23:49.55]He snaps his neck.
[23:55.68]This slap.
[23:57.72]You would have figured the Time Serpent would be the strongest of all these serpents.
[24:03.12]There's no room in the ring for anyone to do any moves.
[24:07.41]And now, unfortunately for the Water Serpent, he kind of drizzled his way outside the ring with a big chokeslam by the Air Serpent onto the Earth Serpent.
[24:15.71]And while the Air Serpent is really making... No, he gets reversed.
[24:19.65]There's a downward neck-breaking move there by the Fire Serpent.
[24:24.11]Who is going to do his forward slashing?
[24:26.45]What are they doing outside right now?
[24:28.53]There are three serpents just outside lying down on the ground.
[24:33.87]I wonder if anyone's going to use the cage.
[24:37.61]Let's see what the total is for the poll.
[24:39.76]The moon time serpent currently has a pretty large edge over the moon serpent.
[24:45.26]But if you'd like to continue voting, there it is.
[24:51.41]I don't know if anyone's going to get a pin off.
[24:52.95]This might last like 30 minutes.
[24:55.69]As the air serpent now goes into the corner and falls down, but the water serpent picks him up.
[24:59.41]No, what is the moon serpent doing?
[25:06.30]It's just a bunch of children's backyard entertainers in a ring at the same time.
[25:12.94]And by the way, the sun serpent is not in here.
[25:16.10]Because, well, for one...
[25:18.80]You can't have more than six people in the ring in WWE 2k17 and Jerma never killed him.
[25:25.45]I never killed him so That would that was the excuse for why I couldn't have a second Wow He's gonna get chokeslammed off the top rope Air serpent looks like he is really pulling things out here a lot of people didn't want to give him any credit looking at the pole Air is way at the bottom.
[25:45.07]I would probably have my money on air at this point.
[25:46.87]I
[25:48.34]The Time Serpent is the favorite.
[25:52.30]But I'm not sure how anyone's gonna win.
[25:55.20]Nobody's utilized the cage.
[25:56.40]They have these, like, elaborate game modes, but, like, the Earth Serpent's got time on the top ropes.
[26:01.58]A huge potential backwards drop?!
[26:05.12]That was so lame.
[26:07.26]What a shitty move.
[26:09.98]That was a terrible move.
[26:12.90]In every way.
[26:14.54]He just picked him up and placed him on the ground.
[26:19.43]He's got tombstone!
[26:22.26]The Earth Serpent just tombstone, what are they doing?
[26:26.20]He's just holding the air.
[26:38.99]Time Serpent now just kind of watching.
[26:41.75]Waiting for his opportunity to grab the Water Serpent.
[26:45.61]There's a smash to the Air Serpent in the side room.
[26:56.45]Oh, wait, I thought that was a pin.
[27:02.16]Seems the Time Serpent's gonna go on the top rope here.
[27:04.52]He might be going for his signature move.
[27:07.02]No, it was just an elbow drop.
[27:08.44]Don't worry.
[27:09.24]Nothing spectacular at all.
[27:10.94]There's no way to even talk about this.
[27:15.41]Two Serpents out of the ring, leaving room for the Moon Serpent to... Ooh, that was a pretty significant move.
[27:21.51]That's two!
[27:23.51]There's no referee, but that was a two-count on the Water Serpent.
[27:28.65]Into the corner.
[27:29.23]Are we gonna see an upset here?
[27:31.59]Is the Moon gonna... No, not going for a pin.
[27:37.13]The Time Serpent gonna go for Father Time, his signature move.
[27:42.16]Taunting to the audience now is the Moon Serpent, getting ready for it.
[27:44.42]I'm not sure what... I don't know what you were doing.
[27:46.74]But the Chocolate Earth Serpent...
[27:49.42]Just got you in trouble now.
[27:51.48]He's got the Vulcan press on him.
[27:52.81]He's by the ropes and there are no rules in Hell in a Cell.
[27:55.81]But don't worry about that.
[27:58.31]The Air Serpent was my favorite.
[27:59.95]Seems to be now on the outside of the ring.
[28:03.21]And I don't know what the Earth Serpent is doing on the top rope.
[28:06.41]He's just, he's kind of just up there.
[28:15.22]The chocolate, er, he looks like a chocolate bunny.
[28:19.01]He just looks like a chocolate Easter Bunny.
[28:27.55]I don't think this is... this is never gonna end.
[28:29.89]This is gonna be one of those situations where this just... Ooh!
[28:33.98]This is so stupid, I love it.
[28:39.50]What is he...
[28:44.64]Oh, another tombstone!
[28:47.00]A jumping tombstone!
[28:59.67]This could be it!
[29:00.75]This could be it!
[29:01.43]This could be the end!
[29:02.63]The fire serpent with a jumping tombstone!
[29:05.92]Just go for the pin!
[29:06.64]Just pin him right now!
[29:07.48]There's your opportunity!
[29:08.16]He's still on the ground!
[29:08.78]Get him!
[29:10.60]No, he's gonna... He's going for a submission move.
[29:14.14]Kind of between the legs.
[29:18.31]Everybody has to be pretty tired at this point.
[29:20.79]You have to assume the stamina.
[29:22.99]Air serpent.
[29:24.05]One.
[29:24.79]Two.
[29:26.05]Oh, wow.
[29:26.59]It's a two count.
[29:29.26]One.
[29:29.90]Two.
[29:30.46]I don't even know.
[29:31.30]Because there's no referee.
[29:32.44]I have no idea.
[29:37.08]The water serpent, I believe, is dead.
[29:39.56]I don't think he's getting up from this.
[29:41.94]Oh, I speak too soon.
[29:42.88]Look how exhausted everybody is.
[29:50.04]Everybody is so exhausted.
[29:52.64]It's taking so long for everybody to get up.
[29:56.22]Someone's just gonna get lucky.
[30:03.05]The air surfing with a catastrophic right hand.
[30:07.01]Right into... Wait a minute.
[30:08.85]Oh, he's got it for a choke slam.
[30:11.48]That could be it.
[30:12.52]You just gotta get the pin.
[30:13.66]Oh, here comes another jumping tombstone.
[30:19.92]Oh, it chokeslammed him off the top of the ropes.
[30:23.49]That's it.
[30:24.13]That's it.
[30:24.47]You gotta get the pin.
[30:26.03]Wait, why is it ending?
[30:29.35]What happened?
[30:30.79]The match has been called.
[30:32.87]What happened?
[30:36.91]I don't understand what happened.
[30:39.13]Did somebody die?
[30:41.50]Somebody died.
[30:42.04]Does anybody know what happened?
[30:50.13]Was it the Earth Serpent?
[30:54.75]I have no idea.
[30:55.53]I can't... The Earth Serpent wins.
[30:59.28]When did he pin somebody?
[31:03.14]Did anybody see him pin somebody?
[31:08.49]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Serpent Hell in the Cell is the Earth Serpent.
[31:16.63]Okay.
[31:19.15]Who the first competitor is going to be is going to be... That's Dr. Roetker!
[31:23.63]From Dr. Roetker's Pizza!
[31:25.82]Jerma's favorite frozen pizza.
[31:28.28]It's his first time ever appearing in a Jerma wrestling event.
[31:32.66]Dr. Roetker, of course, is the inventor of baking powder.
[31:36.75]And he is an old school veteran.
[31:40.81]And a lot of people I don't think are going to be ready for his athleticism.
[31:45.01]Dr. Oetker from Dr. Oetker's Pizza.
[31:50.31]A true legend in the world of culinary design.
[31:55.11]Throwing up the symbols there.
[31:56.05]That's the official family symbol for Oetker.
[31:59.78]And we're going to bring in the next contestant in the tables, ladders and chairs match.
[32:05.31]This one's gonna be a big fan favorite.
[32:08.13]I can't imagine a lot of people not voting for EZ-Pete from Fallout New Vegas.
[32:13.41]EZ-Pete, one of the most friendly, wonderful people in the entire video game of New Vegas, making his entrance for the first time ever.
[32:24.15]You've seen the EZ-Pete migration video.
[32:26.95]Probably, I have.
[32:28.95]He's in here and he's gonna prove himself in the Jerma arena.
[32:32.45]EZ-Pete.
[32:35.53]is the second contestant.
[32:38.33]And anything goes here.
[32:39.13]This is a tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[32:42.39]Somebody might get fucking killed.
[32:46.01]Like last time, when apparently, like, the Earth Serpent killed somebody.
[32:51.18]And the final contestant in this Triple Threat Freeway is... It's gonna be a close one.
[33:00.56]It's gonna be close.
[33:03.98]And ZZP is just walking around taunting in the ring.
[33:07.98]I don't want to hit the skip button because I don't want to miss... ...this guy.
[33:14.98]Not this guy.
[33:17.28]This guy.
[33:17.96]Not this guy.
[33:19.16]This guy.
[33:21.83]Jermis Dark Souls 3 character.
[33:24.39]That's right, I'm talking about Frogman.
[33:27.53]He completed the entire campaign and the DLC.
[33:31.17]Had a little bit of trouble with the Crystal Mage, but Frogmen is here from Dark Souls.
[33:36.37]Ready to take on everybody in the ring.
[33:38.40]This is going to be a huge day for Frogmen.
[33:46.14]Place your vets.
[33:47.24]Place your vets.
[33:50.10]Place your vets on who's going to win.
[33:51.10]Dr. Oetker from Dr. Oetker's Pizza.
[33:55.05]Frogman from Dark Souls 3, or Easy Pete from Fallout New Vegas.
[33:58.86]And he's really fired up right now.
[34:00.40]You want to prove himself?
[34:01.54]He's already proved himself.
[34:02.46]He beat the DLC.
[34:03.16]I already said that.
[34:03.94]The DLC was hard as shit.
[34:06.58]And ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get underway here.
[34:09.68]Thank you for joining us.
[34:11.10]Dr. Roker, Easy Pete, and Frogman.
[34:14.35]Let the games begin.
[34:17.50]Remember, the whole point here is you've got to get that briefcase at the very top.
[34:21.22]As Frogman, with an excellent Dark Souls dodge, over the top ropes to get the ladder, not wasting any time to go get it.
[34:27.57]Except I think he's too stupid to bring it into the ring.
[34:30.19]Yeah, he was too dumb, so he decided just to roll it in there.
[34:33.75]As Easy Pete is kind of getting smashed.
[34:37.71]No, he reversed it right into Dr. Oaker's face, and Frogman's got the ladder now.
[34:43.50]You've got to remember, he's just going to go up and get it.
[34:47.09]You gotta get the money in the bank briefcase that's on the top.
[34:51.12]Wow, what the hell is that?
[34:52.76]Frogman's already going up top to get the briefcase!
[34:54.92]This is gonna be over!
[34:55.90]No, Dr. Roker just pushed him over.
[34:57.44]Thank goodness, this could've been over real quick.
[35:06.52]Alright, and Dark Souls, that probably would've killed you as a fall.
[35:11.07]Oh, and easy Pete now with the ladder.
[35:13.85]No, it gets ripped out of his hands by Frogman.
[35:17.04]Who is, no, he's got him in the headlock now, gets reversed.
[35:21.39]And he's just taunting to the crowd.
[35:22.83]Frogman really is looking forward to this fight here.
[35:25.53]Two punches, three punches.
[35:26.85]Now he's got him by the ear.
[35:29.30]No, he's going to pick up, scoops him over into a slam on his back while Dr. Roker is kind of woozy outside.
[35:35.64]Getting the ladder, potentially?
[35:38.42]I think so.
[35:40.02]He's got the ladder.
[35:40.70]No, he just went to throw it on the ground.
[35:42.52]Frogman goes in the air for a... Nobody seems to be able to do that.
[35:47.84]Can nobody do?
[35:50.24]Move off the top ropes.
[35:52.40]I don't think so.
[35:53.18]Apparently not.
[35:55.66]Big hanging suplex from Dr. Roker.
[35:59.56]He's still holding him.
[36:01.46]He's letting that blood drain all the way to his head.
[36:04.56]Lands right on his back.
[36:07.61]Let's take a look at the pole here while we get a second and we see a leg drop.
[36:09.83]Let's take a look at what's going on with that pole.
[36:14.05]I'm going to link it another time here.
[36:16.45]Let's see what the current status is.
[36:20.99]Oh, Frogman going up again.
[36:36.84]He's going, he's going to jump off the ladder.
[36:44.33]He could have won the game.
[36:45.77]He could have just won the match right there.
[36:47.49]I'm not sure what the hell he was doing.
[36:49.06]What were you thinking?
[36:50.58]He could have just ended it.
[36:51.72]Now Dr. Roker is going to go to the top.
[36:53.80]He's going to probably grab the briefcase.
[36:55.78]He's got it.
[36:56.92]No, Frogman's there.
[36:57.94]Frogman's there to fight him off.
[37:01.37]With these slow shitty punches.
[37:02.95]This is gonna be it.
[37:04.61]This is gonna be it.
[37:06.79]No.
[37:07.17]No.
[37:11.57]He's just slapping him in the face.
[37:17.91]That's gonna be it.
[37:19.11]That's it.
[37:20.27]That's it.
[37:20.81]No.
[37:21.43]He's gonna get it.
[37:22.75]Easy Pete is not trying to knock him off.
[37:24.83]That's gonna be the end.
[37:25.59]No.
[37:27.07]Frogman's got the briefcase.
[37:39.39]And Dr. Roker now is waiting for EZP to get up off his feet.
[37:43.33]I think we might see the finisher.
[37:44.61]We might see the baking powder!
[37:46.87]Here it is!
[37:47.91]There it is!
[37:48.33]The baking powder!
[37:51.17]Now he's going to set that ladder up.
[37:52.19]He's got to get up there.
[37:53.23]He's going to take... No, he's just going to drop it and just get punched in the face.
[38:01.70]Dr. Roker throws Frogbit into this corner.
[38:04.90]And again into the other corner.
[38:06.90]Now he's going to do a little bit of a super move.
[38:10.76]Right in his chest, Dr. Oetker.
[38:17.06]Easy Pete.
[38:18.47]Easy Pete.
[38:19.05]I thought it was John.
[38:20.23]Now Easy Pete now has an opportunity.
[38:22.41]Let's hope he doesn't blow it here.
[38:23.89]Could we see Easy Pete with the Money in the Bank Championship?
[38:27.20]He's got it.
[38:27.68]Does he get it?
[38:28.10]Can he undo the whole thing?
[38:29.80]Frogman is just barely getting to his feet.
[38:31.36]Can he stop EZP from unhatching this?
[38:33.48]Doesn't look like he can.
[38:34.46]Oh, he just barely is up there.
[38:37.11]And here comes another potential bad case.
[38:41.25]No.
[38:42.37]He can't.
[38:47.63]Dr. Oka with a double, double push off the ladder.
[38:52.15]Dr. Ocher just, with the strength of 60 pizzas, tossed it down into the ground.
[38:58.09]And we might see a victory here, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:59.83]Dr. Ocher.
[39:01.45]Can Frogman get up to the top of the ladder in time?
[39:03.56]What a fast.
[39:04.44]He must have been holding down the sprint button.
[39:07.02]I'm sorry.
[39:07.58]No, and now Easy Pete now.
[39:09.48]He's gonna... No.
[39:11.66]No, Easy Pete can't do it.
[39:12.76]He's not strong enough.
[39:14.48]While they're fighting on the top...
[39:23.24]Oh, good god almighty!
[39:28.16]I think this is gonna be it.
[39:29.68]This is gonna be it.
[39:31.58]Easy peasy.
[39:33.10]No, no.
[39:35.66]No, he can't.
[39:36.36]He powerbombed him.
[39:37.46]A catching powerbomb.
[39:42.72]This has just been a back and forth bunch of bullshit.
[39:46.85]My god, EZP is now stuck in the ladder again.
[39:49.77]As Dr. Roker now making his way up.
[39:51.67]You need to keep them on the ground.
[39:53.91]You can't just... Because now... Okay, here's Frogman's turn.
[39:56.90]Frogman's now going to push the ladder over.
[39:59.16]And knock them both off.
[40:01.32]Wait a second!
[40:02.22]No!
[40:05.98]Stop rolling out of the ring!
[40:07.70]Every time that happens, one of them just rolls out of the ring.
[40:12.00]Every single time.
[40:12.96]And now he can't even figure out where it's going to go.
[40:16.97]Oh, this is a good plan.
[40:18.71]Get him out of the ring there.
[40:19.55]Frogman's gonna go for... Ooh.
[40:22.57]That was a reverse neck break onto his knee.
[40:25.27]This is an opportunity here.
[40:26.35]I think this could be the end.
[40:27.22]Ladies and gentlemen, Frogman.
[40:28.74]EZP just barely getting to his feet here.
[40:30.90]Can he get up the ladder in time?
[40:32.96]Of course he can.
[40:34.66]You've seen this happen like six times now.
[40:37.24]I wonder what's gonna happen.
[40:39.53]Is Frogman gonna- No, he reversed it!
[40:41.87]He reversed it, but no, here comes Dr. Roker!
[40:43.99]I'm just gonna push the fucking ladder over again, and you're both gonna fall down!
[40:48.00]This is not something!
[40:52.08]Oh, this is it.
[40:53.10]This is it.
[40:53.72]This is it.
[40:54.30]This is it.
[40:54.92]Get on the ladder.
[40:56.94]Dr. Roker's pizza.
[40:59.78]He's got it.
[41:00.58]He's got it.
[41:01.81]This is the end.
[41:03.35]They're both barely just getting to the feet.
[41:04.83]This is the end.
[41:05.19]He's got one clip.
[41:06.65]Can he get the second clip?
[41:07.47]He's got it!
[41:09.52]Dr. Oetker is your Money in the Bank champion, but the ladder match.
[41:13.04]Dr. Oetker's pizza.
[41:16.29]Let's take a look at some of those replays there.
[41:17.69]Big boot from Dr. Oetker, who's a brand new, and there it is.
[41:21.09]There's the baking soda.
[41:23.25]Patented move, and there's him unclipping while EZP just barely got up.
[41:27.93]Wasn't there in time.
[41:28.63]He got the two clips off like nothing, and for the first time, I think he's a very promising competitor.
[41:34.24]You're going to see more of Dr. Oetker for sure.
[41:39.41]Dr. Oetker is your ladder Money in the Bank champion.
[41:47.78]We have something very special here, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:51.62]Back alley brawl with two of the most highly rivaled contestants in the entire Jerma Rumble.
[41:57.23]It's already started here.
[41:59.19]Jerma has got Glue Man in the back.
[42:01.35]This just started.
[42:03.37]The bell didn't even ring yet and Glue Man and Jerma are now fighting in the back.
[42:06.09]Glue Man doesn't even have his cape on, wasn't even in full costume.
[42:10.09]In the back here, just getting destroyed by Jerma.
[42:13.57]Now he's got to pick them up in a big suplex here.
[42:16.77]A huge, almost into a sit-down driver there.
[42:20.97]And now he's on top of the shoebox.
[42:23.11]Waiting for him to get up.
[42:24.09]Can Jerma get up?
[42:24.63]I'm not sure.
[42:24.99]He's waiting.
[42:25.47]He's taking his time.
[42:26.43]And he completely missed.
[42:28.11]He completely missed him.
[42:31.27]And Jerma now gets the upper hand on Glue Man.
[42:33.69]What a savage kick.
[42:36.65]Into a scoop slam.
[42:45.25]Oh, and Derva with a couple of right hooks there.
[42:47.92]They need to get out of this area.
[42:49.22]Oh, right into the wall.
[42:51.52]Right into the wall.
[42:54.89]I didn't know you could do that.
[42:58.36]Right into the dressing room.
[43:00.70]Somebody be careful somebody's gonna utilize that trash can I can tell you right now.
[43:04.42]Yep.
[43:05.17]I knew it He was gonna pick up the trash can it just kills him.
[43:09.75]He's geek killed him Blue man finally has his revenge on Jerma.
[43:13.17]I think he actually killed him with the trash can the trash man would be proud oh
[43:18.29]There's chairs in here.
[43:19.21]Ooh, a big chin breaker there by Jerma.
[43:21.89]Kicked right into the sternum.
[43:23.09]And a DDT right into the ground.
[43:24.45]That's not... That's really, really hard ground.
[43:27.41]And just choking him aggressively.
[43:28.95]Look at him.
[43:29.31]Look at that psycho.
[43:30.99]He is a real piece of shit doing those dirty tactics.
[43:36.49]Outside again they're going to go, it seems.
[43:38.83]There are random people standing around.
[43:40.17]There's a couple of security officials that are going to let this just go.
[43:44.81]And now Jermis got to... Jermis got to hold... He's getting... What the fuck was that?
[43:58.48]He picked... I feel like this is Dead Rising Ooh, gets him with the Spindy Doodle How many times has Jermis said Spindy Doodle for a move?
[44:06.68]Probably a hundred Ooh, picked Sweet Chin Music there on Glue Man Glue Man is out
[44:14.47]And now you can hear the crowd just booing Jerma.
[44:17.37]He's one of the most hated wrestlers.
[44:19.97]People despise him.
[44:21.05]He does so many underhanded moves.
[44:23.33]What?
[44:23.77]That was a cool move.
[44:27.31]And you're probably wondering, Jerma's face looks a little odd because the picture was taken in weird lighting.
[44:32.11]It's his Twitter profile picture.
[44:34.87]So, and they're going to move down a little bit here.
[44:36.85]A swing and tornado DDT into that ground.
[44:41.35]Hard ground.
[44:42.78]And do we have a pole currently up?
[44:43.92]I'm not sure we have a pole up.
[44:45.58]Getting... Gluban has an upper hand here with an elbow drop on his back.
[44:51.58]Another elbow drop right into that lumbar section.
[44:56.41]Picking it up here, he gives it a go.
[44:57.53]Oh, boy.
[44:58.63]Another snap DDT.
[45:00.75]You can see the pain in Jervis' face.
[45:02.15]He's really feeling it right now.
[45:03.57]I wish they would move somewhere else besides this one small corner of the backstage area.
[45:09.19]I don't even know how anybody... How do you even win?
[45:11.87]The little man's getting ready for something.
[45:14.67]He's getting ready.
[45:15.07]He's got... He potentially has him in some type of finishing move here.
[45:19.89]No, that was a signature move.
[45:21.29]That was not a finisher.
[45:22.06]At least I think so.
[45:24.86]No, he's going to get thrown into the shoebox again.
[45:27.16]No, it's going to happen again.
[45:28.38]It's going to happen a third time?
[45:31.70]No, belly-to-back suplex.
[45:34.38]Alright, there's the straw ball right there.
[45:36.68]Let's take a look at what the results are right now.
[45:40.36]Uh, the results are... Oh, Gabe, nobody has faith.
[45:43.12]And right into the shoebox there, Jermmer, his head.
[45:45.36]Ooh, getting booed now.
[45:47.89]People don't like those dirty tactics.
[45:50.41]Right into the ground, shoves his face with a reverse sidewinder.
[45:53.17]I don't even know what move that I'm trying to say.
[45:58.09]Sam, you guys have been enjoying this fight.
[46:00.39]This has been the throw the guy back and forth from shoebox to shoebox fight.
[46:05.29]Which is a very, very great fight.
[46:07.29]I wonder if there's like a water cooler that's gonna be buff.
[46:08.95]Oh, big, huge tiger back suplex there.
[46:12.49]I wonder if they can... Can anything even happen?
[46:14.37]Can he throw him into the arena?
[46:15.79]Oh, now they're getting over here by the barricades.
[46:19.75]Gabe's got that trash can again.
[46:22.17]This proved to be very devastating last time.
[46:24.59]Overhead swing dents the trash can.
[46:29.81]No, just throw him again.
[46:31.53]Just run into a wall.
[46:32.47]That is perfect.
[46:33.27]Oh, and he's taunting.
[46:35.43]You can tell.
[46:36.23]Look, people love him.
[46:37.76]He's the most loved character in all the Jerma wrestling universe.
[46:40.88]And we're going to go for another throw into the wall.
[46:44.54]I wonder how many... It seems like a blue man's shoulder might be injured.
[46:50.70]This is... He missed the grab.
[46:54.00]He missed the grab, but he got it again.
[46:55.21]It's okay.
[46:57.63]That's another finishing move, it seems.
[46:59.07]Are we going to get a pin situation here?
[47:00.47]Nope.
[47:02.79]Well, that's it.
[47:09.81]Dermot died.
[47:10.47]Dermot's dead.
[47:12.79]That's it.
[47:13.17]Let's take a look at the highlight reel.
[47:15.99]Look at replay number one.
[47:16.99]Alright.
[47:21.89]Okay, so here's one of the highlights, guys.
[47:24.61]Let's take a look at it.
[47:27.11]Okay, cool.
[47:28.45]He catches his leg.
[47:30.53]Good.
[47:31.33]What's the second replay?
[47:33.79]Second replay is... Ooh, that's a bit sweet chin music there by Jerma.
[47:37.37]Let's take a look at that again.
[47:38.19]Ooh, right in the face there.
[47:41.27]Replay three.
[47:41.89]A couple of elbows to his face.
[47:45.63]What a bad replay.
[47:47.75]And then to end it all, it seems... Yeah, this is where Glue Man did his... No.
[47:54.33]No, he's going to do his finishing move.
[47:56.75]And they're gonna cut.
[47:57.99]They're gonna cut.
[48:00.13]Look at that face.
[48:02.55]Well, your winner by, uh, knockout, I would assume, is gonna be Glue Man.
[48:08.32]That's Glue Man, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:13.26]That fucking, that, like, sucked.
[48:15.68]Yeah.
[48:16.64]Yeah.
[48:17.22]Yeah.
[48:17.96]Yeah.
[48:18.32]Yeah.
[48:20.80]Yeah.
[48:21.79]Yeah.
[48:38.14]You saw them earlier.
[48:39.89]It's gonna be Team jermaMoon and Mr. Sneakman.
[48:42.39]The new tag team.
[48:44.93]For some reason, they're coming out as a pair.
[48:47.99]Where the others never did.
[48:50.83]But here they are.
[48:52.18]The team of jermaMoon and Mr. Sneakman.
[48:54.76]Two of the stupidest characters.
[48:59.87]And I mean like brainless characters.
[49:02.35]Mr. Sneak Man's cape is on the wrong side.
[49:05.39]It's probably just going to get taken off.
[49:08.36]I'm not sure who they're going to be facing.
[49:11.44]What tag team could they be facing?
[49:12.78]Could it be potentially?
[49:15.34]I'm not sure it might be.
[49:16.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[49:20.15]That's the Archmage.
[49:21.67]The Archmage of Mampang from Sorcery.
[49:26.68]And who's his partner going to be?
[49:27.70]I'm not 100% sure.
[49:29.59]Nobody likes the Archmage.
[49:33.41]He's one of the most hated people, one of the most feared people in all of High Xamon.
[49:40.75]And he's here.
[49:41.23]He's here to take on this team.
[49:42.23]I'm not sure who his teammate's going to be.
[49:43.25]He's only coming out alone.
[49:49.49]And there he is, getting in the ring.
[49:50.49]The cage is not lowered yet.
[49:52.07]Let's be very clear about that.
[49:55.41]And his partner.
[49:57.17]Wherever it may be.
[50:03.15]jermaMoon is not impressed at all.
[50:06.00]By this very tiny but very powerful man.
[50:09.32]And let's get his partner in here now.
[50:12.34]Jerma has prayed many times to this person.
[50:15.46]And they did not do very much for him.
[50:18.32]Because that is who you... Could you guess who that is?
[50:20.36]It's Lorag!
[50:22.05]The god.
[50:24.26]He's a real asshole.
[50:25.75]He's a real piece of shit.
[50:28.01]He tried to kill Jerma so many times during his playthrough of Sorcery.
[50:33.11]And there he is, using his swindling smoke.
[50:38.64]Lorag and the Archmage.
[50:41.44]Taking on jermaMoon and Mr. Sneakman.
[50:46.37]In a steel cage match.
[50:50.33]He's a real asshole.
[50:51.59]He's a real... He's like jumping around like crazy.
[50:55.51]And there he is.
[50:56.01]Ladies and gentlemen.
[50:59.67]Here comes the Steel Cage Tornado Tag.
[51:02.85]I hope you enjoy it.
[51:04.13]If you want to vote, by all means go for it.
[51:08.41]And we'll see how this goes.
[51:11.00]The cage is now down.
[51:12.18]Mr. Sneak Man and Turbo Moon versus the Archmage of Man Pang and Lorak.
[51:18.20]From sorcery.
[51:19.32]A lot of sorcery characters.
[51:20.85]But I feel like there are a lot of people to cover, so... jermaMoon is huge, by the way.
[51:28.09]Mr. Sneakman is just grabbing his wrist.
[51:30.67]And putting it to the side.
[51:31.85]Ooh, that was a nice movement.
[51:33.41]Flipping over his head and snapping his neck down.
[51:39.38]I thought you could just see Mr. Sneakman's balls for a second.
[51:42.10]I was about to go, wait a minute, what?
[51:45.39]Now, you guys remember the rules, you have to get out of the cage.
[51:50.08]I feel like, oh, big bear hug there, but Lorag's stopping him.
[51:54.44]In his tracks, gets a couple of hits in his face.
[51:56.16]Look at how much bigger jermaMoon is.
[51:58.50]Oh, big seeded powerbomb onto the Archmage.
[52:02.10]There's a huge clothesline.
[52:07.57]Mr. Sneak Man is on the top ropes already.
[52:09.78]He's looking for the crowd to get behind him, and he wants the Archmage to get up.
[52:14.04]He's standing now.
[52:15.86]Here he comes!
[52:16.52]A huge reversal from the Archmage.
[52:23.05]And now it's the Archmage's turn.
[52:24.61]The Archmage is taking a turnbuckle off of the corner.
[52:29.63]That's a dirty trick if I've ever seen one.
[52:35.06]How is that possible?
[52:36.52]How is it possible?
[52:38.16]You can't pick a guy up that's that big.
[52:39.88]There's no way.
[52:45.45]The Archmage.
[52:46.77]He is the most powerful entity, almost in the whole world.
[52:50.99]In the universe, I would say.
[52:54.23]I wish Gerber Moon would get the fuck out of the way so we could see.
[52:57.59]While Mr. Sneak Man does a big standing stomp.
[53:00.72]Misses a couple times, and Lorag now... Lorag's making his way out of the ring!
[53:04.24]Remember, you gotta climb outside, but Mr. Sneak Man pulls him down!
[53:09.20]Quick thinking there by Mr. Sneak Man.
[53:10.66]I mean, remember, everyone in the ring is an idiot.
[53:13.14]They're all fucking morons.
[53:14.96]So it's remarkable that the AI would even allow... Wait a minute, as I say that, the Archmage making his way up the... No, Mr. Sneak Man again!
[53:24.67]It's going to be hard for one of these guys to get out.
[53:27.41]It's going to be very difficult.
[53:28.27]And the big belly to back suplex.
[53:30.13]Two in a row there.
[53:31.71]They seem to have a little bit of momentum.
[53:33.59]Mr. Sneak Man.
[53:35.09]And the jermaMoon.
[53:36.76]Another one back to back.
[53:39.22]It seems... Can he get... What is he doing?
[53:44.34]He's... A huge knee drop.
[53:49.48]And it seems like the fan favorites of this one.
[53:51.50]Another one.
[53:51.84]A second jumping knee drop on Lorag's face.
[53:55.68]jermaMoon and Mr. Snakeman are currently winning this pull-in.
[53:58.52]A big elbow drop.
[54:00.46]Surprised he didn't break the ring.
[54:03.24]Lorag with a nice front suplex there.
[54:05.50]Ooh.
[54:06.71]Kind of got behind him there and threw him on his back.
[54:08.41]Big punch in the face.
[54:13.57]He's going to get out.
[54:14.89]jermaMoon is going to get out.
[54:16.11]No, look.
[54:16.71]The Archmage is climbing up too.
[54:18.89]What is he?
[54:19.23]He's going to... Huge.
[54:21.88]Wow, that crowd is silent.
[54:25.10]The crowd.
[54:26.12]Wow, what a dead fucking crowd.
[54:29.09]Holy shit.
[54:30.89]He just did a belly-to-back suplex off the cage and the crowd was just like, yeah, I don't care.
[54:35.09]It was kind of cool.
[54:35.71]And the Archmage is kind of on his way up.
[54:36.89]This could be it.
[54:38.43]This could be it.
[54:39.69]As Lorag is placing...
[54:42.66]Mr. Sneakman is choking me!
[54:43.82]The Archmage is gonna get out!
[54:45.64]The Archmage is gonna get out!
[54:46.46]This could be it!
[54:47.82]This is gonna be it!
[54:48.58]It's over!
[54:50.20]It's it!
[54:51.73]Mr. Sneakman is getting Tombstoned!
[54:57.49]And ladies and gentlemen... No, wait a second!
[55:01.66]I think they both have to get out!
[55:04.10]They both have to get out of the ring!
[55:09.63]And Lorag is just getting destroyed.
[55:14.19]Why would you leave Lorag hanging like that?
[55:17.75]That is unbelievable.
[55:18.63]I'm surprised they both have to leave.
[55:20.05]They're both just gonna leave, I would assume.
[55:22.43]Do a couple of huge moves to him and then... Oh, well, they'll just like glitch him into your body.
[55:27.46]Let him run back and forth a little bit and then... See what he's gonna do.
[55:35.94]Alright, if I'm Mr. Sneakman... And the moon...
[55:41.08]I mean, you have to do, like, you have to beat the shit out of him and then... Oh my goodness, that was fucking crazy.
[55:48.84]Just get out.
[55:49.48]Take this opportunity to leave.
[55:52.32]You don't have to get... Yeah, jermaMoon's got the right idea.
[55:54.35]Sneak Man, get out of there.
[55:55.17]You guys can win right now.
[55:57.19]No, he wants to do a frog splash to him.
[55:59.75]jermaMoon is currently straddling the top of the cage and he's on his way out.
[56:03.63]It is now down to Mr. Sneak Man and Lorag who is taunting the crowd here.
[56:09.98]And the Archmage is kind of just waiting for jermaMoon.
[56:13.44]Huge powerbomb with the strength of Mr. Snakeman.
[56:16.66]That was unbelievable.
[56:17.70]One hand picked him up.
[56:19.69]Now they're both just staring.
[56:23.35]He's dragging him to the middle of the ring.
[56:25.29]I don't think he realizes that you just have to leave.
[56:29.22]If he just gets out, then they win.
[56:32.18]And... Here he goes.
[56:34.71]Here he goes.
[56:35.27]This is going to be it.
[56:36.07]If Lorag doesn't get up right now, Mr. Sneakman's reaching the top of the cage.
[56:41.31]Lorag just barely getting up.
[56:42.57]Can he get... He's not going to be able to catch him in time.
[56:44.19]This is going to be it.
[56:45.68]Mr. Sneakman and jermaMoon have won the cage match.
[56:48.76]The cage match.
[56:52.64]That's it!
[56:53.70]Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Sneak Man and Chairman Moon have won the cage match.
[56:59.38]The tornado tag.
[57:00.10]Let's take a look at some of those replays here.
[57:01.50]Mr. Sneak Man with a big scooper.
[57:03.63]Slaps him on his back.
[57:05.63]And do you remember when this happened?
[57:07.15]Remember when he grabbed his leg for a second?
[57:10.33]Remember when he glitched into his hand?
[57:11.99]And that was the big kicker right there.
[57:13.17]The one-handed powerbomb, I think, is what sealed the deal and made his way out.
[57:19.99]Unbelievable work by Mr. Sneak Man.
[57:22.97]Keeping it together.
[57:24.01]And slowly getting out of that cage.
[57:26.69]This is a 30-man rumble.
[57:29.24]All the characters you've seen so far and some surprises will make their way down.
[57:35.44]And apparently the big surprise for me is this random fucking guy that I never made.
[57:38.46]Alright, let's go.
[57:40.22]He's in.
[57:41.60]I didn't put entrance music on for anybody.
[57:46.64]Oh wait, no, yes I did!
[57:48.20]Yes I did for one person!
[57:50.68]The first contestant is Glue Man!
[57:57.89]Oh, that sucks for Glue Man.
[58:00.63]Glue Man is not going to win.
[58:03.89]Yeah, make sure you put a hashtag, Royal Rubble.
[58:10.01]Here comes Glooban, the first contestant, which means you're pretty much a gay.
[58:13.43]It's like CM Punk.
[58:14.63]I don't even know.
[58:15.71]I accidentally did one.
[58:18.33]But there he is.
[58:18.93]It leads you to believe it's too bad.
[58:24.27]He's not going to win this rumble unless he can stay in, which you've seen how the AI works in this game.
[58:29.21]They're all fucking idiots.
[58:29.99]He's going to fall out.
[58:32.95]Let's see who the next person is.
[58:34.79]The next contestant, the only other entrance we're going to get.
[58:39.21]I don't know who it's going to be.
[58:40.71]By the way, there's seven serpents.
[58:45.69]It's Dr. Oatker.
[58:47.61]Number one and number two.
[58:49.49]Dr. Oatker and Glue Man.
[58:54.41]Alright.
[58:54.93]Remember how it works?
[58:57.65]Every 30 to 60 seconds, another person comes out.
[59:01.23]You got to get thrown over the top ropes.
[59:07.19]Slowly walking down.
[59:09.61]He looks so sad.
[59:12.31]And Dr. Okur earlier this evening, as you know, won the tables, ladders, and chairs match, which was just a ladder push people off the ladder match because that's all they did.
[59:24.15]And let's get it underway.
[59:26.04]Blue Man and Dr. Okur, first two contestants, 30-man rumble.
[59:30.50]Here we go.
[59:32.99]So, we get some fancy camera shots, immediately Dr. Oetker picking Glue Man up, in his patented blood rush, head cold, suplex, and Glue Man just kind of staring.
[59:45.85]As Dr. Oetker, I like this camera work, he's just stomping on Glue Man's chest, he's hungry.
[59:51.41]He's starving for this.
[59:53.83]Whoever wins, remember if you win a Jerma Rumble, you get an immediate title shot, the next week, which we never show.
[60:02.61]Never talk about it.
[60:06.12]He's gonna throw him into the ropes here.
[60:08.26]Is Gloom Maiden gonna get instantly eliminated?
[60:10.86]Here comes another contestant.
[60:11.74]I don't know who it's gonna be.
[60:12.56]I have no idea because there's no entrances.
[60:17.10]Who the fuck is it?
[60:18.52]It's the Archmage.
[60:20.28]The Archmage is the third contestant.
[60:24.27]Double teaming here.
[60:25.15]Oh, right off the bat.
[60:26.09]Two double DDT onto Dr. Roker.
[60:29.84]As Archmage gets a kick in the... What the fuck was he just trying to do?
[60:33.06]Archmage was just trying to punch Dr. Oaker.
[60:36.45]And ended up getting himself in trouble.
[60:39.23]As Dr. Oaker, now fighting, gets Fireman carried over.
[60:42.99]And the Archmage seems to be conserving a little bit of strength here.
[60:45.43]As much as he can.
[60:46.45]As much strength as you can conserve.
[60:49.57]While Dr. Oetker now seems to be on the receiving end.
[60:52.63]He could get kicked out.
[60:54.05]Archmage is not gonna save him.
[60:56.13]He could get kicked.
[60:57.53]No!
[60:58.35]Oh, he doesn't.
[60:58.97]No.
[60:59.39]Here comes another contestant.
[61:00.21]We're gonna have four in the ring.
[61:01.81]Who's number four?
[61:04.31]Three people gonna make it four.
[61:05.53]Who is it?
[61:07.13]It's Lorag right off the bat.
[61:08.78]These two know.
[61:09.56]Archmage is just like, fuck you.
[61:11.86]You lost me that!
[61:12.62]I'm gonna do this!
[61:13.32]No!
[61:13.90]He gets reversed!
[61:17.86]These guys are probably tired from the last match they were just in.
[61:22.44]These two just were in a match.
[61:24.28]And they just lost.
[61:24.93]So they're probably very angry at each other.
[61:26.73]Blue Man is just on the top rope waiting for Dr. Ocher to stand up with a leg drop onto the Archmage in the... That was a... That was cool.
[61:36.13]That was real cool.
[61:37.61]That was a jump off the top ropes Hurricane Rana.
[61:39.93]Well, Blue Man, for his trouble, is going to potentially... He's getting grabbed by both... On his face by Dr. Orko going back and forth trying to throw him in.
[61:47.35]Here comes number five.
[61:48.13]Five people are going to be in the ring.
[61:51.40]Who is it going to be?
[61:54.36]Oh, wait a minute.
[61:54.94]I think that's... I think that's the Sun Serpent.
[61:58.34]Yes, that is the Sun Serpent.
[62:00.82]Welcome, Sun Serpent.
[62:01.74]This is your debut.
[62:03.96]Just realized something.
[62:04.80]I'm having a little bit of an epiphany here.
[62:08.34]There is like a 28% chance that a Serpent is going to win the Rumble.
[62:12.75]Because there's seven of them.
[62:13.75]There's like a 23 or... There's a high percentage chance that one of the seven Serpents will win the Rumble.
[62:24.07]Keep that in mind.
[62:27.23]Because he was not... He's fresh.
[62:28.54]He was not even in any of these fights.
[62:32.82]Sunday view, yep.
[62:34.42]I would conserve my energy, but Lorag and Archmage are still fighting in another... It's getting crowded now.
[62:39.46]Six people are going to be in the ring.
[62:41.94]I wonder if it's going to be... Oh, wait a minute!
[62:45.22]Hold on just a second!
[62:46.78]I think that's... That's Andrew Jackary Jacked!
[62:50.97]From Fallout 4.
[62:52.11]That's Andrew Jackary Jacked!
[62:56.53]I don't know why he's even in this Rumble, because Jerma fucking hates Fallout 4.
[62:59.98]And is he gonna immediately come and eliminate Glue Man?
[63:03.40]He's got Glue Man on the ropes.
[63:04.34]Oh no!
[63:05.18]Andrew Jack-a-reject!
[63:07.94]No!
[63:08.36]Glue Man's the first elimination!
[63:11.31]Glue Man's the first out.
[63:12.55]That sucks.
[63:13.89]And he got eliminated by Andrew Jack-a-reject.
[63:17.07]That's the worst fucking person to get eliminated from.
[63:20.67]That guy's the fucking worst.
[63:27.14]And he's just choking the Sun Serpent now.
[63:30.43]While Dr. Ocher is just waiting and looking on, looking in the wings.
[63:34.33]That was so fast.
[63:39.55]I don't even know what happened.
[63:41.88]Andrew Jack Kerry Jack in the Sun Serpent with a huge backwards flip over the ropes.
[63:48.76]That was very impressive.
[63:54.08]No, now he's gonna get involved.
[63:55.86]You might see, dude, Lorag and the Archmage have not fought any other person but each other.
[64:02.13]They have only fought each other.
[64:04.98]And the Archmage is a backflip and moonsault onto Lorag.
[64:10.88]I don't know why they won't fight anybody else.
[64:13.16]Like, go fight anyone else.
[64:17.15]A huge powerbomb.
[64:18.25]No, he's getting hooked on.
[64:19.29]Here comes another contestant.
[64:20.29]What was that?
[64:21.51]Huge right hand onto Dr. Roker.
[64:23.71]Well... Who is that?
[64:26.93]What is going on?
[64:29.31]I think... That person... I don't know who this person is.
[64:32.50]That person has a VR helmet on.
[64:34.60]That's like a confused VR guy.
[64:37.52]That guy's not supposed to... I think he's just playing a VR game.
[64:39.96]I'm not sure he even knows he's in the ring right now.
[64:42.04]Can somebody tell me who the fuck that is?
[64:45.58]This is a VR guy.
[64:47.28]Okay.
[64:47.72]Guy playing a VR game.
[64:49.82]I'm not sure he even knows he's here.
[64:51.86]Okay, well, he's in the ring now.
[64:53.66]Wow, we have... We've got Lorag.
[64:58.79]Lorag is going to eliminate the Archmage.
[65:01.99]He's going to kick him out.
[65:04.52]He just barely, barely can he get him out?
[65:07.40]Can he actually get him out?
[65:08.64]And the VR guy thinks he's like picking up some stuff in Minecraft.
[65:12.89]I'm not sure what he's thinking.
[65:13.69]He thinks he's on top of like a... Oh, big kick there!
[65:16.77]Big kick by the VR guy.
[65:20.45]Who is just playing a VR game.
[65:22.51]He doesn't even like know.
[65:23.49]He seems to not have any pants on.
[65:25.83]He's got a ripped up shirt.
[65:26.81]He must have got some really fucked up shit before he got here.
[65:30.11]play his virtual reality game.
[65:32.37]He's like wandering into the arena, and he's gonna try and rip that off.
[65:35.59]Nope, nope, the VR guy's... uh, doing a little bit of work and... somehow picking up Andrew Jackery.
[65:40.87]Jack, no!
[65:41.81]He's gonna get downward spiral while Lorag and the Archmage... Lorag and the Archmage are still only fighting each other.
[65:50.24]Still.
[65:51.56]Still.
[65:55.66]The VR guy just got kicked hard by Andrew Jackery, Jack.
[66:05.35]I knew this guy was gonna be, like, my favorite.
[66:07.47]It's just a guy that has a fucking HTC Vive on, and, like, doesn't even know he's in the ring.
[66:14.77]He was, like, in the audience.
[66:17.41]As the Sun Serpent... He doesn't even know.
[66:22.41]He's, like, playing a different game.
[66:25.10]As the Sun Serpent, he's gonna get eliminated, potentially, by Dr. Roker.
[66:29.00]Getting kicked.
[66:30.68]And now Lorang in the R-Range.
[66:36.24]I can't believe they've only fought each other.
[66:38.18]Andrew Jack Kerry Jack gets a huge punch by the guy that doesn't even know he's in the ring.
[66:48.94]And Dr. Roker almost eliminates the Sun Serpent.
[66:52.36]And the VR guy seems like he might just do the job for him.
[67:00.97]He's just watching.
[67:03.95]Lorag is eliminated.
[67:05.43]Lorag gets a huge crossbody dropkick.
[67:09.83]Harkmage with his elimination.
[67:11.87]See you little Lorag.
[67:12.75]Didn't sense danger there, did you?
[67:16.95]And the VR guy.
[67:17.91]No, VR guy is still hanging on.
[67:20.23]Somehow.
[67:21.43]I'm not sure what he's playing at this point, but the Sun Serpent might eliminate him right now.
[67:24.38]He might come in as fast as he came out.
[67:26.44]All the way around is what I meant to say.
[67:28.89]No, the VR guy still holds on.
[67:31.66]He can still hold on.
[67:32.92]Big, huge suplex.
[67:34.36]No, it gets reversed.
[67:36.00]That's Dr. Roker.
[67:37.20]Dr. Roker.
[67:38.11]Chest punched Lorag.
[67:40.33]Not Lorag.
[67:44.26]He's just smashing his face.
[67:47.30]The Archmage, I think, is bleeding.
[67:49.87]The Archmage has been... Dr. Roker might get his third elimination.
[67:54.11]No, Doctor... By the way, talking about eliminations, talking about new contestants.
[67:58.17]Here comes another competitor.
[68:00.62]Well, Dr. Roker now on the... Ladies and gentlemen, that's Hitman.
[68:04.62]That's Agent 47.
[68:06.66]He has made his way into the arena.
[68:09.12]Maybe he'll assas- Oh no, he's going for an assassination attempt.
[68:12.16]On to the VR guy.
[68:12.96]No, there goes the Archmage.
[68:15.60]The Archmage of Mampang is now eliminated.
[68:18.32]And now we have the VR guy.
[68:20.28]The Sun Serpent, Dr. Orker, and Agent 47.
[68:28.10]The VR guy's still in the... Dr. Roker's still in it, too.
[68:32.08]Don't rule out Dr. Roker.
[68:33.20]Well, Agent 47 now has the VR guy by the face.
[68:38.57]Hopefully he can still hang on.
[68:40.11]Well, he hangs on for dear life.
[68:41.17]The VR guy just barely, barely gets out of that.
[68:43.75]And we have another contestant coming in.
[68:45.17]Big leg drop onto the Sun Serpent.
[68:49.05]What's the probability we'll see another serpent?
[68:50.83]Ah, there it is.
[68:51.39]There's the Moon Serpent.
[68:52.25]There's the Moon Serpent.
[68:55.70]There comes the Moon Serpent.
[68:57.39]No, maybe the serpents will fight each other now.
[69:00.31]Looks like they are.
[69:02.17]Moon Serpent immediately comes in with a belly-to-back suplex there.
[69:07.13]But 47 is just over and over again crushing on the VR guy.
[69:14.14]He must probably be wondering why he's in so much pain right now.
[69:17.48]But he's too busy playing Job Simulator.
[69:21.37]Or one of the only other tech demos that exist for virtual reality.
[69:24.79]I'm not sure what he's playing, but it gets him there.
[69:26.37]Oh no, he falls down!
[69:28.23]47 falls down right on top of him, and he gets a kick in the back for his trouble.
[69:32.48]The Sun and the Moon are now in the ring together, where here comes another contestant.
[69:37.38]Ooh, the R guy looks like he's into trouble.
[69:39.12]Here comes Jerma!
[69:41.24]Jerma is in the ring now, immediately gets... No, Dr. Roker has a chance to get rid of him.
[69:48.78]Dr. Oetker could do a huge upset here and get rid of Dermot right off the bat.
[69:52.51]Well, the VR guy is still holding up a dear life.
[69:54.79]He does not get eliminated.
[69:55.85]VR guy still in it somehow.
[69:57.44]I'm not sure.
[69:59.06]And now the tables have turned.
[70:00.52]Jerm is gone.
[70:01.14]Immediately.
[70:01.96]Jerm is gone.
[70:02.54]That's it.
[70:02.88]He's done.
[70:04.22]Jerm is out.
[70:05.16]He came in.
[70:05.62]He's gone in two seconds.
[70:09.37]He's gone.
[70:09.79]He's already gone.
[70:12.51]Dr. Oatker, man.
[70:14.25]Dr. Oatker turned into a top seed somehow.
[70:20.81]No!
[70:21.19]There he goes!
[70:22.15]Dr. Oatker eliminates the VR guy.
[70:26.00]Oh, God.
[70:26.64]That's like six eliminations for Dr. Oetker.
[70:30.47]He's got hit, man.
[70:31.53]He's got 47 down by the face.
[70:33.15]See you later, VR guy.
[70:34.17]Hopefully, he can find his way out.
[70:40.34]Dr. Oetker with a huge punch.
[70:42.22]Two eliminations.
[70:43.16]Three, four, five.
[70:44.04]Count them.
[70:46.95]And the serpents are still fighting each other.
[70:49.15]God, I'm going to be so... I'm going to be so upset if it turns out that we get like six serpents in the ring for the final six.
[70:56.62]Please, God, tell me that's not going to happen.
[70:59.10]I would be so sad.
[71:01.14]But there goes the Sun Serpent, the Moon.
[71:03.04]Moon eliminates the Sun like a textbook.
[71:07.48]Down to three with Dr. Oaker still in the ring.
[71:10.45]47 still in the ring as well.
[71:12.09]And here comes another contestant.
[71:15.41]Oh, here comes the Time Serpent.
[71:16.95]Okay, good.
[71:17.73]At least we're getting, like, all the serpents out first.
[71:22.62]We're gonna watch.
[71:24.52]We're just gonna watch.
[71:26.96]Okay.
[71:27.80]This is back and forth.
[71:30.14]Okay.
[71:30.96]The Time Serpent eliminates the most...
[71:35.25]Finally gets rid of him.
[71:37.03]And the Time Serpent now is one of the three.
[71:40.54]Holy shit.
[71:41.78]I thought he was just going to throw him over the top ropes.
[71:44.16]I was about to shit my pants.
[71:45.28]Time Serpent almost eliminates Dr. Okra throwing him over the top ropes.
[71:49.15]But no, gets interrupted by Agent 47.
[71:50.75]Who could... Might just clean this whole ring up right now.
[71:57.97]Oh, he misses.
[71:58.65]Doesn't get it.
[71:59.03]Gets a shoulder tackle into his chest.
[72:02.27]And here comes... Oh, here comes the water serpent.
[72:04.67]Okay, good.
[72:06.95]That's like four serpents in a row.
[72:10.02]And Dr. Roker is going to do the hanging dry... Dry cleaning.
[72:14.22]I don't even know what the fuck this move is going to be called.
[72:15.74]But he's doing something.
[72:16.34]He's doing the move that he does a lot.
[72:17.54]You've seen it before.
[72:18.26]Like the toilet flush move.
[72:24.25]He's trying to just shove him over.
[72:26.39]Oh my god.
[72:26.73]I'm going to throw up.
[72:28.91]I'm going to fucking puke myself.
[72:30.31]I love this.
[72:32.26]He's just got him on the head.
[72:36.30]No, 47.
[72:37.88]Looks like they're both doing way worse.
[72:49.92]Dr. Oetker.
[72:51.04]Dr. Oetker.
[72:52.06]And here comes Mr. Sneak Man.
[73:00.01]Mr. Snake Man is in the ring.
[73:01.29]Dr. O'Kerr is eliminated.
[73:02.49]Like 10 fucking people.
[73:05.71]Dr. O'Kerr.
[73:09.85]Oh my god.
[73:11.45]Second contestant in the ring is still here.
[73:13.39]Oh my goodness fucking gracious.
[73:18.07]Doing so much work.
[73:21.44]I'm surprised.
[73:21.96]I can't even believe he still has any energy.
[73:26.60]This is the point, you gotta get him out of here.
[73:28.69]If you are the Water Serpent and you're Mr. Sneak Man, you gotta get him out of the ring.
[73:33.47]He's causing way too many problems.
[73:35.21]Whoa, I thought he was gonna get thrown over.
[73:40.49]Oh, here comes jermaMoon!
[73:42.37]jermaMoon is the next.
[73:43.33]He's pretty much just a serpent, but he has a jermaMoon face.
[73:47.15]That's the only difference.
[73:49.53]And Dr. Oatker!
[73:51.63]Cool, it looked like Mr. Sneak Man was gonna line him up there for a big kick.
[73:57.09]As jermaMoon has the Water Serpent now.
[73:59.79]All the way on the ropes.
[74:02.25]Could we get another Serpent elimination?
[74:04.15]I hope so.
[74:05.83]No, I don't want a Serpent to win.
[74:09.04]They have the advantage right now.
[74:10.64]All the Serpents have an advantage.
[74:11.78]It's not cool.
[74:14.26]Big punch there.
[74:16.06]A couple of them.
[74:16.60]A couple of huge punches.
[74:18.98]Dr. Roker is in big trouble right now.
[74:21.92]Big trouble.
[74:22.76]Big trouble.
[74:23.35]Big trouble.
[74:23.77]Big trouble.
[74:24.13]Dr. Roker is gone.
[74:25.89]That's it, Mr. Snake Man eliminates Dr. Ocher.
[74:28.41]After, and here comes Paul Bearer.
[74:30.51]Paul Bearer in the ring now as Dr. Ocher.
[74:33.19]You can hear the crowd really, all the energy drained from them.
[74:36.34]They cannot believe that their fan favorite with almost 10 eliminations is gone.
[74:42.42]And look at him walking back to the ring and Paul Bearer is gonna be gone immediately.
[74:47.25]Paul Bearer is just, no he's not.
[74:49.63]No one's gonna get the Jerma.
[74:52.13]No one's gonna get Jerma.
[74:53.11]At least I hope not.
[75:00.66]But Mr. Sneakman now, no going for DDT, no.
[75:03.98]No.
[75:04.92]Paul Bearer and jermaMoon currently locked in.
[75:07.84]A little bit of a melee there.
[75:10.05]Well, oh boy, not good.
[75:12.43]That was a very cool move.
[75:14.51]Mr. Sneakman did a reverse powerbomb.
[75:16.51]Hurricane Rana.
[75:18.11]And there he is, finally makes his appearance.
[75:19.87]The Bia, Bia number 882.
[75:21.55]Okay, the whole moon just landed on Paul Bearer.
[75:26.38]The entire moon just crashed into him.
[75:29.64]Bja 882, welcome to Jerma Rumble stream edition.
[75:34.68]And jermaMoon might immediately come out as fast as he got in there.
[75:38.36]He's only been in for about a couple of minutes.
[75:39.50]Can Bja get an elimination?
[75:42.08]I think that... Wow.
[75:43.56]No.
[75:44.51]I was going to say for the first time ever.
[75:45.71]Has Bja ever got an elimination?
[75:47.73]I don't know.
[75:48.65]I really don't think so.
[75:50.75]Now, double... Double Russian leg sweep there on the jermaMoon mode.
[75:55.37]Bja, that's a bad place to go.
[75:56.85]Do not go in the top ropes.
[75:58.03]What the hell are you doing?
[76:00.33]And Mr. Sneak... Oh, Mr. Sneak... Oh, he's still in it.
[76:01.83]Mr. Sneak Man's still in.
[76:04.41]Who's next?
[76:06.73]Oh, that... Oh, that's Sluggo the Melted Action Figure.
[76:17.38]Who could forget him?
[76:19.98]Sluggo the Melted Action Figure.
[76:22.00]Yeah, he just got in.
[76:23.70]He's just currently pushing Paul Bearer.
[76:27.90]I wish you could see Sluggo's face.
[76:30.85]Because he... I fucking hope he does not win.
[76:41.53]He better not win.
[76:50.94]God, I can't even fucking talk.
[76:54.20]Sluggo the Melted Action Figure, is doing some work on Paul Bearer.
[76:59.89]But we still have another couple of Serpents.
[77:01.95]Well, Mr. Sneakman now on the corner.
[77:04.37]Can he get pushed out by the Water Serpent?
[77:08.10]And Paul Bearer now in trouble.
[77:11.66]He's gone.
[77:12.36]Mr. Sneakman's gone.
[77:15.06]Mr. Sneakman has been eliminated.
[77:16.60]That's his first appearance ever.
[77:19.25]Actually wrestling in an event.
[77:21.73]And he did pretty well.
[77:23.55]Hats off to you, Mr. Sneakman.
[77:24.91]You did okay.
[77:26.17]Not nearly as good as Dr. Oka, but Sluggo...
[77:29.71]Seems to have Paul Bearer on the ropes here while the Water Serpent is just looking on.
[77:33.30]Can Sluggo the Melted Action Figure, get and eliminate?
[77:37.28]No, he's too much of a little shit.
[77:39.46]It's not going to happen.
[77:40.12]His stats are terrible.
[77:41.78]Pretty sure he has the worst stats out of all the people, so that would be bad if he won.
[77:46.17]It would be really bad.
[77:46.77]It would be sad if he won.
[77:47.71]No, go.
[77:48.53]Elimination clone.
[77:51.75]The Viat and the Moon have just been fighting over here.
[77:55.77]It has not stopped.
[77:59.14]Big frog splash there.
[78:02.07]On to Paul Bearer by Sluggo the Melted Action Figure by the BIA.
[78:05.25]BIA number 882 is currently getting mooned right now, getting pushed with that big moon foot.
[78:11.17]Is he actually going to get an elimination?
[78:12.57]Come on, moon.
[78:13.61]Get rid of a BIA.
[78:14.31]Nobody wants a BIA to win.
[78:16.31]I'm sure some people do, but most people don't.
[78:19.67]What the hell was that?
[78:22.11]Did the moon just intentionally just jump over there?
[78:26.53]He's rigged.
[78:27.72]Come on, he's the only character that has, like, terrible fucking stats.
[78:31.88]Looks like he was just going for a pinball.
[78:33.14]He just kicked.
[78:36.40]He kicked Paul.
[78:37.44]The moon is gone.
[78:38.26]jermaMoon has been eliminated.
[78:39.34]Paul Bearer got kicked in the fucking face.
[78:41.84]Square in his mouth.
[78:44.52]And, oh, here comes Orson Welles.
[78:47.30]Two tag team members in here.
[78:49.05]Two members of the same team.
[78:50.77]Oh, the Water Serpent is pummeling Paul Bearer's face.
[78:54.65]So much so...
[78:59.44]Don't go on the top rope.
[79:00.62]Are you fucking stupid?
[79:03.20]Why would you get up there?
[79:04.18]The BA is just on the top ropes.
[79:06.52]Oh, good.
[79:06.86]Punch him.
[79:07.44]Punch him from the top rope.
[79:10.40]And there it goes.
[79:11.62]Paul Bearer gets chokeslammed over the top ropes by the water serpent.
[79:16.36]And the BA didn't get much done.
[79:18.56]Not much at all.
[79:20.80]As now, Dorsen Wells is on the ropes.
[79:25.81]Come on.
[79:26.41]The water serpent has to get the fuck out of here.
[79:29.87]Nobody wants the Water Serpent to win.
[79:31.19]Nobody wants any of the Serpents to win.
[79:32.39]Maybe like the Time Serpent, but he's already gone.
[79:35.61]Big suplex there.
[79:38.47]As here comes the next contestant.
[79:39.79]And now he's taunting again.
[79:40.63]The Water Serpent's done the same taunt like four times.
[79:42.51]And here's Easy Pete.
[79:43.89]Easy Pete is in the ring now.
[79:45.91]A fan favorite, as you all know, from the last match we just saw.
[79:50.07]Easy Pete.
[79:51.47]Welcome to the Rumble.
[79:52.71]First entry.
[79:54.07]First time here.
[79:56.23]Good job in your tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[80:00.43]And Orson Welles.
[80:02.49]No.
[80:02.99]Back and forth, back and forth.
[80:04.17]Nope.
[80:04.95]Just barely while Skluggo puts up some of this like greasy melted plastic and burns.
[80:10.77]He's burning his face.
[80:11.59]Burning the ass face.
[80:13.27]That has to be terrible.
[80:15.46]That was a beautiful move by EasyP.
[80:17.24]Big walking slam there.
[80:21.60]I love this.
[80:22.72]Oh wow.
[80:23.84]If EasyP had walked into that, that would have been amazing.
[80:30.62]No, there goes the Bia.
[80:31.84]Sluggo has eliminated Bia882.
[80:35.40]He's gone.
[80:35.98]Did somebody else get knocked out?
[80:39.39]No, that Flanker came in.
[80:40.73]In comes Flanker.
[80:42.11]I'm not even sure what number we're at.
[80:43.33]We've got to be more than halfway now.
[80:46.27]Or at least close to halfway.
[80:49.56]As Sluggo...
[80:52.74]It would be a shame for him to get two eliminations, but at the same time, get the Water Serpent out of here.
[80:57.27]No, just barely stays in.
[80:59.11]Flanker is here.
[80:59.70]One of the two representatives of Sorcery.
[81:04.06]Surveying the field, not doing very much.
[81:06.62]No, he's going to take the opportunity.
[81:08.16]Yeah, he got rid of him.
[81:09.50]Water Serpent is gone.
[81:10.94]Sluggo just threw his body in the air after that and took down Flanker.
[81:14.49]So I see a little Water Serpent.
[81:16.87]Now we've got some interesting people in the ring.
[81:18.29]This is a good combo, I would say.
[81:22.10]Of equal parts good and bad.
[81:26.88]I mean, Flanker is cool, Orson Welles is cool, Easy Pete is cool, but Sluggo, Sluggo's the worst character I've ever made.
[81:35.05]And I didn't even make him.
[81:37.25]Etalyx made that guy on SharePlay.
[81:39.91]So, that's Etalyx' character.
[81:41.81]And he gets DDT'd, and here comes a Snattercat!
[81:43.91]It's a Snattercat!
[81:45.53]I can't believe I can even see him!
[81:47.59]Easy Pete on top of him!
[81:53.80]Welcome to Snattercat!
[81:55.24]To the first time ever!
[81:58.50]He's got Easy Pete in a Powerball!
[82:07.55]Why is he standing there?
[82:09.01]He was just standing there!
[82:12.43]And no poster was doing push-ups on Easy Pete's body for some strange reason.
[82:18.53]Nobody will tell while Snattercat is just getting his...
[82:24.42]So long, I was still doing work.
[82:26.75]Oh, God.
[82:28.69]Oh, who's next?
[82:30.31]What do you know?
[82:30.93]It's a fucking serpent.
[82:31.77]It's the air serpent.
[82:33.35]Hello, air serpent.
[82:35.93]Get rid of Snaticat.
[82:37.21]Get rid of him immediately, please.
[82:40.09]An immediate Snaticat elimination from the air serpent.
[82:43.07]You can do it.
[82:44.23]You can do it, Snaticat.
[82:45.65]I have faith in you.
[82:47.53]No, too bad, he's too big.
[82:49.93]He's too big.
[82:50.99]They're both too big.
[82:54.69]The Snattercat is way too big.
[82:59.69]Wilson Wells is currently kissing his bicep and then landing directly on top of... I don't even know who it was.
[83:10.68]The sheer strength of the air serpent tossing the Snattercat backwards.
[83:16.20]You can hear this crowd.
[83:16.92]This crowd is going crazy right now.
[83:18.45]They love the Snattercats.
[83:21.39]And just as they were cheering, they might start to boo.
[83:24.81]Because we've got almost two eliminations could happen right now.
[83:27.15]Sluggo and the Snattercat are both in... No!
[83:30.32]Snattercat just barely gets away over to the air circle.
[83:33.18]Sluggo is still grabbing on.
[83:34.56]Flanker might potentially... There's a lot going on in this ring.
[83:39.88]A very huge amount of things.
[83:42.00]Orson Welles now on the other side of the ropes.
[83:44.23]Easy Pete now.
[83:46.33]Doing the patented grab your face and shake you back and forth a few times.
[83:50.59]Until one of us decides that you're going to get eliminated or you're going to punch me.
[83:55.15]And Orson Welles is gone.
[83:57.25]Easy Pete with the right hand.
[83:59.11]Knocks Orson Welles out.
[84:00.29]Thank you for participating, Orson Welles.
[84:02.67]He's not leaving.
[84:03.25]He's kind of upset at that.
[84:04.47]And easy Pete now going for a choke on the Snattercat.
[84:06.97]He is fired up.
[84:09.82]Sluggo is... Sluggo just can't get eliminated.
[84:13.66]I don't know if I put his, like, stamina or reversal strength up.
[84:18.80]I don't think I did.
[84:19.48]But he's still here.
[84:22.70]Oh, nice reversal there.
[84:23.68]Gets a punch in the face.
[84:25.60]They call him Sluggo, you know, for a reason.
[84:29.72]The crowd is going fucking crazy.
[84:32.58]Who are they even cheering for?
[84:33.80]I don't know.
[84:34.22]Probably the Snaticat.
[84:36.54]If I have to take a guess, it's definitely Snaticat.
[84:40.52]And Sluggo is going to get another elimination here potentially on Flanker.
[84:45.76]No, he's going to the top ropes.
[84:49.16]I don't know why people keep doing that shit.
[84:51.96]Somebody's going to get fucked over.
[84:53.36]Big time.
[84:55.26]Well, EZP going for an elimination on a Snaticat.
[84:57.24]This will be his second or third elimination of the evening.
[85:00.49]Can he do it?
[85:02.49]Oh, Snaticat's holding on.
[85:03.57]Air Serpent is staring.
[85:04.51]No.
[85:05.85]Air Serpent just pulled his underwear up.
[85:08.57]And finally, here comes another contestant.
[85:12.24]And who's it gonna be as Easy Pete now on the receiving end?
[85:15.28]Oh, wait a minute!
[85:17.10]Wait a second, can you see?
[85:18.98]Can you see his loincloth there?
[85:21.24]That's a Tooth Goblin!
[85:22.90]That's a Tooth Goblin!
[85:23.68]Somebody casted Gob backstage!
[85:25.56]I think the Anilander might have casted Gob backstage to get him in here!
[85:28.96]He just walked in immediately, I think the Anilander must have told him to walk straight and come into the ring.
[85:35.78]Looks like that's what he's here for, hopefully the spell lasts a long enough time.
[85:39.50]For the Tooth Goblin to stay in here.
[85:40.98]No.
[85:41.44]Oh, God.
[85:41.98]I thought he was going to get thrown over the top ropes immediately.
[85:52.13]Big Powerbomb.
[85:53.05]He just fell into the ropes.
[85:58.99]There are too many people in here now.
[86:00.47]Somebody's got to get out.
[86:01.33]Oh.
[86:11.40]He just like stepped on it.
[86:12.68]He is just tossing the goblin around.
[86:15.34]It is not even a contest.
[86:17.22]This poor little tooth goblin.
[86:20.01]It's just getting ripped around by the air serpent.
[86:22.79]He is no match for an air serpent.
[86:24.57]No way.
[86:24.93]What is the air serpent doing?
[86:27.41]He is preparing for something.
[86:30.12]No, he's gonna get reversed by the tooth goblin.
[86:34.73]Out of the ring?
[86:35.43]Oh, just right into his tailbone there.
[86:37.69]Snaticat has been trying to eliminate Easy Pete for a good 30 seconds and could not do it, and he's gonna try again.
[86:45.63]As the Tooth Goblin now Sluggo and flanker at it.
[86:48.21]Tooth Goblin, Air Serpent, Easy Pete and the Snaticat.
[86:55.01]As the Tooth Goblin may have seen his last days, he's gonna disappear into a poof of smoke.
[87:00.19]No, he's not.
[87:02.07]He's still in it.
[87:03.28]He is still here.
[87:06.04]He is okay.
[87:09.76]Flanker now... Flanker has not done much.
[87:13.75]Every time I look over and see what they're doing up there, Flanker is just getting his ass kicked.
[87:17.39]Every time.
[87:20.11]There's not been one opportunity where Sluggo has lost up there.
[87:26.52]I can't even see.
[87:27.70]The Snaticat is so big, I can't even see.
[87:31.78]What just happened over there?
[87:32.96]Somebody fell down.
[87:34.26]I think it was Flanker.
[87:36.85]Big kick there from Sluggo on to Flanker.
[87:39.85]Tooth Goblin.
[87:41.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[87:42.49]Wait a second.
[87:43.35]What the fuck was that?
[87:45.25]Wait, wait.
[87:50.80]What the fuck is going on?
[87:53.60]He just pushed him.
[87:55.38]He just shoved him.
[88:00.80]An easy peep with potentially another elimination.
[88:06.06]Ooh, a big reversal there in the right hand of the Tooth Goblin.
[88:10.34]No, gets reversed again.
[88:12.02]Flanker's standing there, staring.
[88:14.46]Oh, God.
[88:18.29]There goes the Snack Cap.
[88:20.05]Sluggo now gets reversed by Flanker, thrown over the ropes.
[88:23.39]Can we finally get this guy out of here?
[88:27.06]Get rid of the Sluggo.
[88:28.75]Fucking get Sluggo out.
[88:30.39]Please.
[88:31.93]I don't want Sluggo in here.
[88:35.15]He's just like a naked guy with a goofy face.
[88:39.88]This is going for a long time.
[88:43.51]And they're going to do it again.
[88:44.27]No, it's going to happen again.
[88:45.11]They're going to throw.
[88:46.10]No, double team.
[88:47.02]Double teaming Sluggo.
[88:49.08]Is it possible?
[88:49.80]Can they get him out?
[88:50.50]Flanker and EZP trying as hard as they can.
[88:53.32]Can they push him out?
[88:54.26]They're going to get him.
[88:55.38]That's it.
[88:57.46]No.
[88:57.64]No.
[88:57.72]Wait a second.
[88:59.34]That can't be.
[89:00.72]Is that how I think it is?
[89:02.48]Oh, that's a ninth president of the United States.
[89:04.45]That's James Madison.
[89:07.15]James Madison.
[89:08.41]He's got like dreadlocks.
[89:10.84]I just realized I fucked up his hair.
[89:13.56]This is James Madison.
[89:14.61]James Madison.
[89:15.93]His first time appearing in a Jerma Rumble.
[89:17.55]Thank you, Mr. Madison.
[89:19.45]I think he was the ninth president of the United States.
[89:21.19]Something like that.
[89:23.39]Who gives a shit?
[89:25.43]James Madison.
[89:27.43]Taking on Sluggo.
[89:28.63]He's getting his face peeled off.
[89:30.85]As he's... Jesus Christ.
[89:35.68]I thought he was going over the top.
[89:38.59]Is James Madison gonna get eliminated by the goblin?
[89:43.45]The goblin's dead.
[89:45.72]The goblin's dead.
[89:47.20]The air serpent is just stomping like a bull in the corner.
[89:53.10]The Goblin just flashed red.
[89:55.37]Oh boy.
[89:55.85]Oh boy, Flanker.
[90:00.55]Flanker with a chokeslam to EZ-Pete over the top ropes.
[90:03.71]EZ-Pete is gone.
[90:05.39]While James Madison is standing on the second turnbuckle.
[90:08.22]Big overhanded double axel smash.
[90:11.62]EZ-Pete has been eliminated.
[90:13.44]Sorry, EZ-Pete.
[90:14.34]Thank you for participating.
[90:15.80]You did a lot of great work, but it wasn't enough to beat Flanker.
[90:22.70]Now Tooth Goblin is on the other side.
[90:25.84]Oh, he's very resilient.
[90:29.88]He's extraordinary.
[90:30.62]Why is this resilient?
[90:32.38]Going up against the Air Serpent.
[90:33.62]This would not work.
[90:36.46]The Air Serpent would have killed him in less than a second.
[90:38.61]Which, there it is, yeah.
[90:39.61]Air Serpent eliminates the Tooth Goblin.
[90:41.25]Let's get a good look at him.
[90:46.37]What the fuck is Flanker doing?
[90:47.83]Flanker just tried to eliminate himself.
[90:52.92]Okay, well, see you later, Goblin.
[90:55.91]You were just a shitty character that wasn't ever supposed to win.
[90:57.89]You were just like a character to make to fill a goddamn slot.
[91:02.65]As Flanker is showing his potential strength and to throw the Air Serpent over the top ropes.
[91:07.96]He doesn't get it.
[91:08.52]Another contestant coming in.
[91:11.60]As the Air Serpent now turning the tides.
[91:14.32]Who's the next contestant?
[91:19.14]I don't know.
[91:19.68]This is not my guy.
[91:21.58]This is not a guy that I made.
[91:24.57]I have no fucking idea who this is.
[91:29.78]Here's the mystery character, because who knows who it is.
[91:32.70]I didn't make him.
[91:34.46]If this guy wins, I'm going to be very fucking mad.
[91:40.63]Don't know who this is.
[91:44.97]And a neck break there by Sluggo onto James Madison.
[91:49.69]Zorro is the mystery character flanker has him by the stomach throws him backwards into the ground I'm trying to figure out who the fuck that could actually be and I have no clue.
[92:02.77]I can't tell you James Madison now almost going over the top.
[92:07.03]He was lying down as here comes frogman frogman a late entry into the rumble
[92:13.38]And you guys know, I've said it before, I'll say it again.
[92:16.74]If you're a late entry, you have a higher, much higher chance to win.
[92:19.46]In fact, there goes Sluggo.
[92:21.82]Thank God for James Madison.
[92:23.68]Thank God he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[92:27.66]This guy's sick.
[92:31.44]This guy's wicked good.
[92:33.12]They have to get that guy out of here.
[92:34.46]He's too good.
[92:37.24]Nice double axel slam by Frogman.
[92:41.16]That guy's going to win.
[92:41.82]He probably has like 97% stats or something fucking stupid.
[92:46.96]God, will I be upset if that's the case.
[92:50.51]Oh, and Flanker has Frogman up in a powerbomb here.
[92:53.61]Huge powerbomb.
[92:56.43]Really breaks his back with that crushing throw into the ground.
[93:00.77]And Flanker, Frogman is so fresh.
[93:03.96]He just got in.
[93:04.78]A powerbomb's not going to do it.
[93:07.52]And that's it.
[93:08.76]Frogman has eliminated Flanker.
[93:12.80]And the Air Serpent is the only one that's still in this ring that's been here for more than 10 minutes.
[93:19.34]The Air Serpent, James Madison Frogman, and this guy.
[93:24.69]The guy with the mask on and red pants.
[93:30.17]I don't know.
[93:32.11]I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
[93:35.95]James Madison throwing the knee into the ground.
[93:38.65]That was very painful looking.
[93:40.09]The air serpent has bad knees.
[93:42.87]Speaking of serpents, here comes the Earth serpent.
[93:44.83]God damn it.
[93:47.54]You guys realize we're coming down to like the final three, the final four now.
[93:51.98]I think there's only like five more contestants or so.
[93:57.31]It's gonna be like three or four serpents in the ring.
[94:00.11]I should've known this was gonna fucking happen.
[94:02.75]No, wait, maybe James Madison will do America justice!
[94:05.66]And he will get rid of the chocolate... ...Earth serpent immediately.
[94:08.94]That would be fantastic.
[94:09.92]Come on, Madison.
[94:10.62]The game crashed.
[94:11.14]No!
[94:13.44]No!
[94:19.24]No!
[94:20.68]No!
[94:28.20]Wow.
[94:30.72]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[94:32.46]Let's try this again.
[94:39.89]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know how it works.
[94:44.17]I wonder who the first two are going to be this time.
[94:48.38]Already boos coming out from the crowd.
[94:50.92]It's Jerma.
[94:52.70]That was such a great rumble too, because I got fucking eliminated in one second.
[94:59.93]He couldn't have ripped that one better.
[95:01.19]Alright, we'll welcome Jerma as the first contestant.
[95:05.79]Pretend the last rumble just didn't fucking happen, apparently.
[95:11.63]It's gonna crash again.
[95:12.47]Yeah, that'd be so sad.
[95:13.27]Alright, who's one, who's two?
[95:22.34]Um... No, it's the VR guy!
[95:26.14]Oh, he just jumped over something!
[95:28.69]No, is he currently grabbing?
[95:29.93]No, he's like spinning around now.
[95:30.89]He's like in a game.
[95:31.51]There he is.
[95:34.09]He's back.
[95:34.53]The VR guy.
[95:36.99]He just jumped over an obstacle in his VR game.
[95:43.00]Did you duct tape your face on?
[95:51.68]Alright, let's do it.
[95:54.28]Here comes the second rumble of the night.
[95:59.39]Let's hope this one doesn't break.
[96:04.87]Pretty good first two people, I would say.
[96:13.79]Jerma with a few kicks onto the guy that doesn't even know he's here.
[96:22.10]Pick him up and do a move.
[96:23.04]No, you don't like taunt.
[96:25.86]You pick him up and you do a move.
[96:32.74]I like how he's wearing a jacket but no pants.
[96:35.08]Yeah, his jacket's all ripped up.
[96:36.96]So that means, like, on the way here, he, like, fucked up and ran into a bunch of shit and, like, ripped his stuff up.
[96:42.36]Big power bomb on a Jerma from the VR guy.
[96:44.64]And here comes the Archmage.
[96:47.68]Number three.
[96:48.36]Was Archmage number three last time, too?
[96:51.20]I feel like he was.
[96:51.86]Oh, well.
[96:56.86]We see an instant elimination.
[96:58.08]This is the third contestant.
[97:00.76]VR guy looks like he's in some trouble.
[97:04.15]No.
[97:05.37]VR guy.
[97:07.21]First elimination.
[97:09.49]See you later.
[97:11.87]The VR game guy is gone.
[97:15.62]Jerma gets an elimination.
[97:16.70]Now how bad would this be of Jerma?
[97:19.28]If I just fucking win from one.
[97:23.96]I'm just choking.
[97:24.80]Just screaming the life out of the Archmage's neck.
[97:29.44]And on the way comes number four.
[97:32.97]Number four is Lorag.
[97:34.75]They just, they do it again.
[97:35.91]They came back to back.
[97:38.03]That was a very cool move by me.
[97:39.45]Nice job, me.
[97:43.59]Lorag and the Archmage came in back to fucking back.
[97:49.27]Again.
[97:52.99]It's rigged.
[97:54.31]I didn't set it up.
[97:54.99]It's just random.
[97:55.93]Random numbers are random, man.
[97:59.18]I wonder, are they just going to toss one person out at a time?
[98:03.77]Or are you going to not let this happen, Lorag?
[98:10.09]No, he's getting grabbed by a DDT.
[98:12.15]No, thrown into the ropes.
[98:15.92]See you later, Jerma, as number five is on his way out.
[98:18.54]Jerma's gone.
[98:19.40]Look at him, he's so weak.
[98:20.62]He's such a weak, weakling.
[98:21.82]There comes the Sun Serpent.
[98:22.66]Is this happening back-to-back again?
[98:26.85]Am I fucking crazy, or did this happen exactly like that, but the only difference is the first two weren't the same?
[98:36.05]I don't think so.
[98:37.11]Did I mess with my own stats?
[98:44.38]No.
[98:45.48]My stats are just as shitty or well as everybody else's.
[98:51.58]Oh, here comes the serpent.
[98:53.26]Time loop.
[98:54.08]You guys remember when we did this?
[98:58.15]The Archmage.
[98:58.71]No, no elimination on the Sun Serpent.
[99:01.42]Punches him in the chest because he can't reach his face.
[99:05.18]Here comes... Alright, here he comes.
[99:07.04]No, no.
[99:07.98]Here comes Glue Man.
[99:09.96]Yep.
[99:10.36]So it's not rigged.
[99:11.36]Don't worry.
[99:11.80]It's not rigged.
[99:12.24]This is Glue Man coming out now.
[99:16.93]Poll results.
[99:17.59]Let me see what these are.
[99:19.81]How many seconds will it take to eliminate you?
[99:24.19]Not quite.
[99:24.87]Not quite.
[99:25.29]I'm still in it.
[99:28.00]Well, it looks like... Oh, no.
[99:30.09]I speak so soon.
[99:31.83]I'm going to get eliminated right here.
[99:34.45]Double team.
[99:35.11]There it is.
[99:35.55]They got both legs in the air.
[99:36.49]Lorag and Glue Man.
[99:38.63]Jerma with his handsome Jack face is gone.
[99:42.18]Okay.
[99:48.44]See, I speak up.
[99:49.10]I start talking about my own character.
[99:51.74]And I just get out.
[99:52.54]I'm gone.
[99:54.21]Let's get the next person in here.
[99:57.10]Well, the Archmage is out.
[99:58.72]Ooh, here comes Bia.
[100:00.06]Bia, number 882.
[100:00.64]Alright, thankfully it's not all fucked up like the last one was.
[100:07.61]Not fucked up, I mean like thankfully they're not.
[100:10.45]Well, at least they're being stupid still.
[100:16.45]What was your goal there?
[100:18.75]He's so big, he could just spin into somebody and just knock them down.
[100:23.44]But he missed everybody.
[100:26.38]Hey, what was the timer for the Bia?
[100:27.42]Because the Bia is definitely going out here right now.
[100:31.71]Oh, no.
[100:32.53]The Perseverance.
[100:33.83]Two punches right to the face of the Serpent and to the Archmage.
[100:39.03]Well, now Gloobman's sort of on the ropes here.
[100:41.49]No, Lorag's going to get reversed.
[100:44.73]Something's not quite right.
[100:50.15]It would be nice if Glue Man makes it for once in his life.
[100:53.50]Well, we're going to have a crowded ring now.
[100:55.42]Six contestants.
[100:57.98]Powerbomb onto the Serpent.
[101:00.66]Here comes 47.
[101:02.14]Hitman 47 is entered.
[101:05.32]Full ring now.
[101:07.80]Dragging the bat by his hair.
[101:11.34]Going to go for an elimination here.
[101:12.28]I think he is.
[101:12.76]Number 882.
[101:14.16]No, he gets stopped.
[101:20.02]Wraps around him, gonna do a belly to back short legs, gets it!
[101:23.28]Blue man now, they keep doing like the same reversals.
[101:31.60]He's gonna do it again.
[101:39.00]47 with two moonsaults from corner to corner.
[101:42.70]Unbelievable athleticism by HitmanAgent47.
[101:46.90]He goes from one side to the next.
[101:49.16]But Glue Man now on the top rope.
[101:51.78]Is Glue Man gonna go for some high right in the face?
[101:55.10]Two boots directly into Lorag's face from Glue Man.
[102:00.08]Beautiful stuff.
[102:02.92]The Sun Serpent has got his back to the wall now.
[102:05.87]And he... Oh!
[102:07.33]Big dropkick.
[102:08.29]Sun Serpent is gone.
[102:09.15]One of the seven serpents has been eliminated.
[102:12.01]That's enough of him.
[102:20.36]Non-target killed.
[102:22.83]Yeah, non-target killed.
[102:24.03]That's minus 5,000 points.
[102:27.99]There's no glue, man.
[102:33.71]No, they're gonna do a double team on the... Yeah!
[102:37.73]The crowd just gets so screamy in these rumbles.
[102:40.33]Another backflip!
[102:41.25]Another moonsault!
[102:44.24]That is the third backflip from Agent 47.
[102:46.74]He didn't do any of that shit last time.
[102:48.38]Not at all.
[102:49.60]He did not do any backflips.
[102:51.06]Why is he doing them now?
[102:55.22]Big moves.
[102:56.39]47 is on his A game right now.
[102:59.77]It looks like he pulled a muscle in his leg.
[103:04.29]Oh, the Archmage.
[103:06.03]Just got to pick him up in a fireman's carry.
[103:07.97]The Bia has been picked up in the same move three times.
[103:10.95]While Glue Man's going to get a neckbreaker.
[103:12.23]Lorag to Glue Man.
[103:15.12]We just don't know.
[103:16.18]I can assume, at this point, they're pretty exhausted.
[103:18.84]Especially Grooman, because he just sucks.
[103:21.66]But here comes the next contestant.
[103:24.50]Oh, look, it's the Moon Serpent!
[103:28.00]Serpent number two has entered the ring.
[103:31.91]And Serpent number two might immediately leave the ring.
[103:35.27]Maybe... We can only wish, we can only hope, right?
[103:41.36]That's Glue Man.
[103:42.88]Picking up Lorag.
[103:43.75]I wonder if Glue Man's going to go for his patented move.
[103:46.95]The shit stain.
[103:48.47]Yep, there it is.
[103:49.87]The shit stain.
[103:52.31]The Moon Surfer's going to get... No, 47 stays in.
[103:56.29]Reverses the punch.
[103:59.30]Speaking of backflips, why do they keep doing them?
[104:02.76]That's backflip number four.
[104:06.02]Huge hanging suplex here.
[104:07.74]Well, if he has going to potentially get rid of the Archmage...
[104:10.81]He's got him on the ropes!
[104:12.36]The Archmage holds out while Gloom Man nearly goes over the top ropes.
[104:17.60]Lorag just looks like a... I don't even know.
[104:21.02]He looks like Court Jester.
[104:22.54]He looks like shit.
[104:27.05]Again, the Archmage potentially going out again!
[104:29.47]I have no idea.
[104:31.79]If you're just joining us again, if you're coming back, the game crashed at the final, like, eight contestants.
[104:39.45]So we're just doing it again.
[104:42.99]Oh, now the Archmage is in a headlock from the... Yeah, no, Murd Serpent going over the top ropes.
[104:47.91]Agent 47 seems to have an opportunity.
[104:49.51]This is going to be a... Oh, Glue Man gets a dropkick.
[104:53.17]That usually is grounds for being eliminated.
[104:55.69]I can't believe he's still in this.
[104:58.63]Every time you see that move, they go over the top ropes, but he stuck with it.
[105:03.19]Unbelievable job from Glue Man.
[105:04.81]Gave the Glue Man the grossing.
[105:06.45]Not going to fuck up this time.
[105:09.44]As the Archmage of Mampang is currently working the forehead and doing some type of prayer now.
[105:15.05]To the Bien number 982882, whatever his name is, they're all the same, who cares.
[105:23.02]Wrenching that neck now is Lorag onto Glue Man, big reversal!
[105:27.30]DDT going for a powerbomb, gets DDT for his trouble now.
[105:30.30]The Bien's going to the top ropes again.
[105:31.66]I wonder if he's gonna do a backflip, no, he's gonna do an L-flip drop.
[105:37.01]I wanna see some more Moonsaults from the fuckin' Agent 47.
[105:39.95]Look, Spants!
[105:44.51]Freakin' out!
[105:47.82]And there goes the Moon Serpent.
[105:50.30]Agent 47 with a right hook.
[105:53.50]And this does not bode well for Glue Man.
[105:55.18]You got two people now staring down at him.
[105:57.90]Lorag and Hitman. 47.
[106:04.28]Oh, God.
[106:04.90]Right hook.
[106:06.08]There goes PI number 888.
[106:08.20]I keep seeing his fucking name wrong.
[106:13.27]882.
[106:13.29]882.
[106:14.55]But 47 this round.
[106:16.85]It was Dr. Oaker last time.
[106:18.03]47 seems to have the mojo.
[106:20.69]No.
[106:21.85]There goes Blue Man.
[106:25.08]47 with another elimination.
[106:28.70]That's at least his third or fourth.
[106:31.89]Now you've got Agent 47, Lorag, and the Archmage of Mampang.
[106:37.33]The Archmage has been in here the longest.
[106:39.81]It has been... I think this is contestant number 8 or 9 coming up here?
[106:44.38]Or 10?
[106:44.48]The limit is getting eliminated.
[106:47.00]That makes... I believe this is 10 coming up.
[106:50.48]And the Archmage is going to take a seat and rest.
[106:53.74]He knows he has an opportunity to sit there.
[106:55.35]He's going to wait for the next contestant to come out, whoever it is.
[106:59.82]Well, there he is again.
[107:00.98]Andrew Jackery Jacked.
[107:04.32]It's Andrew Jackson.
[107:05.84]It's John Kerry.
[107:06.96]And he's jacked.
[107:10.58]One of the biggest pieces of shit character that got made up like six days ago.
[107:18.18]And was only in like one stream appearance.
[107:21.91]But somehow he made it to this rumble.
[107:26.27]I believe he's coming.
[107:26.91]That's number 11, I think.
[107:29.46]If I have no idea, it's because I don't.
[107:31.42]And they did about two... Uh-oh.
[107:33.45]Speaking of top seeds here, 47 now could potentially get run over.
[107:37.89]And, oh, Lorag is gonna get caught up by the Archmage.
[107:40.11]We saw this last time.
[107:41.81]The Archmage and Lorag fought the entire time last time.
[107:44.79]Well, another competitor's coming in.
[107:46.27]Who's it gonna be?
[107:48.53]It's the Time Serpents.
[107:50.52]Fuck the Serpents.
[107:52.94]He's just like, oh, yes, I can't wait.
[107:57.08]Well, thankfully, they're all coming in early.
[107:59.32]So that means maybe they'll all get the fuck out of here.
[108:01.18]And a big Andrew Jack Harry Jack is gone in less than 60 seconds.
[108:07.82]He's already gone.
[108:14.86]That makes me sad.
[108:16.18]He at least stayed in there a little bit longer last time.
[108:19.29]Got his ass kicked.
[108:22.04]The fuck is that thing?
[108:23.48]He just took off the turnbuckle.
[108:26.63]He took off the... You can't do that in a Royal Rumble.
[108:30.51]That's against the rules.
[108:31.67]You can't take off the turnbuckle.
[108:33.71]You're gonna hurt somebody.
[108:36.53]Oh, wow.
[108:37.01]Look, it's the water serpent.
[108:41.51]Oh, thank God that all these serpents are coming in one after the other.
[108:46.52]That means they're not gonna win.
[108:48.20]What the fuck is he doing?
[108:51.01]He's doing this little, like, crow hop without doing any moves.
[108:55.51]There goes the Time Serpent.
[108:56.59]Big knee onto the Archmage of Manpeng.
[108:59.67]Which is kind of odd considering that they are his pets.
[109:05.07]Lorak is just stomping.
[109:08.14]47.
[109:09.82]Big right hook.
[109:11.46]Oh!
[109:11.60]47.
[109:11.70]Okay.
[109:19.21]I hope it's a serpent.
[109:20.77]Please be a serpent.
[109:21.73]Please.
[109:21.98]Please.
[109:24.28]No, it's Mr. Sneak Man!
[109:29.04]Oh.
[109:30.31]Okay.
[109:33.51]Oh god, yeah, I love it.
[109:36.84]Let's just hope the game doesn't crash.
[109:38.28]Oh, Mr. Sneak Man.
[109:41.16]Could get rid of the Water Serpent right now.
[109:43.76]Please say yes.
[109:45.50]We do not want them in here.
[109:46.67]No one gets reversed.
[109:47.25]Gets a shoulder tackle.
[109:48.49]Wow.
[109:49.19]The Archmage goes up with a knee-breaking slash.
[109:52.79]And the Time Serpent just taunting the audience.
[109:56.29]Trying to get the audience behind him, but... No one's going to want to get behind him.
[109:59.91]Jesus.
[110:03.17]Oh my god.
[110:05.22]Those punches to the face were heard around the world.
[110:09.09]Because now it seems that the Archmage is going to potentially go over here.
[110:13.85]Took like 10 punches in the face.
[110:15.79]Is he going to take an 11th from the Time Serpent?
[110:18.85]Yes, he is.
[110:19.41]That's two eliminations back to back.
[110:21.17]That is the Archmage and Hitman both gone at the same time.
[110:24.37]Hitman was in there for a long time, eliminated at least four or five people.
[110:29.40]And there he goes.
[110:31.28]Now the ring has cleaned up a little bit.
[110:32.84]Lorag has still been in there for quite a while.
[110:35.91]And then you got the two serpents, Mr. Snake Man and whoever is coming in next.
[110:40.00]These right hands from the Time Serpent.
[110:42.24]The Time Serpent's fucking destroying with these, like, massive haymakers.
[110:48.06]And there's another... God!
[110:52.98]Dude, the Time Serpent.
[110:54.44]That is another punch.
[110:56.18]Elimination from the Time Serpent.
[110:57.41]Just crushing over and over again into his face.
[111:00.25]Right hand over right hand over right hand.
[111:01.69]Now we got two Serpents and the ever elusive Mr. Sneak Man.
[111:08.81]And who could be the next contestant?
[111:12.59]The two serpents are just, they're working together at this point.
[111:15.69]The seven serpents of Mampang.
[111:18.00]This is not going to look good for our friend Mr. Sneakman.
[111:22.30]Dude, double smash there, just stomping him, no contest at all.
[111:26.38]Let's hope that somebody can get in and equalize this a little bit, whoever it's going to be.
[111:29.82]Oh, it's the jermaMoon!
[111:32.59]It's jermaMoon, thank God for jermaMoon, this is Mr. Sneakman's partner.
[111:35.85]You know he's coming in here to get vengeance for his friend.
[111:38.85]Smister Sneak Man and the jermaMoon.
[111:41.81]We saw them win in the cage match earlier this evening.
[111:44.29]Let's hope they can continue winning here.
[111:47.15]Oh shit.
[111:49.11]I hope he doesn't get punched in the face by the Time Serpent.
[111:52.54]No, he ends up making it out.
[111:54.80]And we hear the crowd now getting a little bit more momentum.
[111:56.80]Hopefully get behind these other two so the two Serpents lose a little bit of their traction.
[112:03.16]Mr. Sneak Man is in a bad spot.
[112:04.84]Hopefully he can do the thing that they always do.
[112:07.31]Yeah.
[112:08.15]Yes, he did it.
[112:08.77]He did the eye dive under and hit you in the stomach.
[112:10.97]Big scoops.
[112:11.61]No, gets reversed and gets punched right in the back.
[112:14.79]Three punches here and in comes another contestant.
[112:19.00]It's Paul Bearer.
[112:20.84]If there was ever somebody I was glad to see, it's definitely glad to see the Bearer.
[112:25.90]Takes his time getting in the ring.
[112:28.89]And this could be the Time Serpent's untimely demise.
[112:34.03]No.
[112:35.07]He's still in it.
[112:36.47]What are you doing, Paul?
[112:38.85]You gotta get rid of the serpents.
[112:39.97]The serpents are like the two shitheads that gotta go.
[112:43.93]You don't just stand there and then give this fucking sneak man a neck breaker.
[112:46.90]That's the worst thing you could have done.
[112:48.32]Big right-handed hammer punch onto the top of the Time Serpent's head.
[112:53.34]He's going up top.
[112:55.56]jermaMoon up top with a big elbow drop.
[112:58.07]Lends it effortlessly.
[113:01.81]And count the amount of people that a giant guy is in foam suits.
[113:07.53]Ooh, and here comes the top seed from last game!
[113:10.35]It's DrRotger!
[113:13.30]I hope he cleans up right now.
[113:15.06]He cleaned up last time.
[113:16.14]DrRotger's pizza.
[113:17.68]Best frozen pizza you could possibly buy.
[113:21.20]I'm not being paid to say that.
[113:22.92]I just truly believe it.
[113:24.74]And immediately goes for Paul Bearer as DrRotger.
[113:29.14]Big right hand.
[113:29.69]No!
[113:30.09]Gets reversed.
[113:31.59]As the huge guys in foam suits.
[113:34.59]He's just stepping on Mr. Snake, man.
[113:36.71]Oh, look at that little fun move I just did.
[113:39.53]I just did a big... Now I'm gonna throw you over there, too.
[113:41.90]Now it's your turn.
[113:44.20]As the moon is very heavily pushing onto the Time Serpent's chest.
[113:49.10]Going for...
[113:50.77]That's it!
[113:51.51]No!
[113:52.83]The Water Serpent doing the same taunt he does in the middle of the ring.
[113:57.49]Every time.
[113:59.00]He says, I'm gonna chokeslam you.
[114:02.32]Oh, jeez.
[114:03.60]Huge overhead press to Mr. Sneak Man.
[114:07.34]Well, Dr. Hooker.
[114:14.03]His huge punches.
[114:17.01]Mr. Snakeman with a very, very enticing move.
[114:19.58]Paul Bearer gets a kick right in his face from Dr. Roker.
[114:23.44]It seems as though Mr. Snakeman now... Mr. Snakeman's gonna get chokeslammed potentially out of the ring by the Water Serpent.
[114:32.54]And he does.
[114:32.98]That's the end for Snakeman.
[114:36.02]Two times in a row he has been screwed by, I believe, a serpent.
[114:40.29]I think it was the Water Serpent last time.
[114:43.81]I think it was one of the serpents.
[114:47.32]How bad does it make you feel that the two serpents are the ones that have been in here the longest?
[114:53.66]As Otger doesn't seem to have the same energy he had last time.
[114:57.94]Seems to be draining.
[114:58.74]Did somebody do a move?
[115:03.73]Finally, someone's about to do a move.
[115:07.87]The water serpent.
[115:09.91]Okay, I thought Paul Bearer... No, that was... Who the fuck is over there?
[115:12.55]I was going to say Paul Bearer.
[115:13.69]That's Time Serpent.
[115:17.76]There he goes, stomping again in the corner.
[115:20.94]That's what you get for taunting.
[115:22.38]That's what you get for taunting.
[115:23.72]Paul Bearer has an advantage here.
[115:25.24]Is Dr. Oaker gonna help him?
[115:26.48]No.
[115:28.46]Not really.
[115:31.20]Hashtag Royal Rumble.
[115:34.08]And here we go, here comes another contestant.
[115:38.05]Is it gonna be... Oh no, it's Sluggo the Melted Action Figure.
[115:46.42]The ring is full of such shit right now.
[115:50.24]There's only one cool character in this whole fucking ring.
[115:54.07]The rest of them suck.
[115:57.85]And they all have, like, a high chance to win.
[115:59.63]That's, like, this fucking sad part.
[116:05.37]A Sluggo gets wrapped around by Paul Bearer.
[116:08.84]Oh, here comes a chokeslam, right?
[116:10.66]Here comes a chokeslam, right, water serpent?
[116:14.52]As he gets hit right in the balls.
[116:15.78]Big uppercut there from Paul Bearer onto Sluggo.
[116:20.20]As the Time Serpent has the jermaMoon in a Razor's Edge.
[116:24.74]I didn't even know he had that move.
[116:27.34]There's no pins though, Time Serpent.
[116:28.84]Sorry.
[116:29.14]Are they going to do the same move?
[116:31.04]No, he's too heavy.
[116:31.90]Dr. Roker is too heavy, but still in for hurting himself.
[116:35.68]Did you just call out-gird Paul Bearer not cool?
[116:40.58]Well, Paul Bearer's cool.
[116:42.33]Dr. Roker's like kind of cool.
[116:45.26]I guess they're cool.
[116:46.98]I'm mainly talking about the four dick shits.
[116:48.82]Like, the dick shits.
[116:50.08]I was going to say dipsticks.
[116:52.94]These four dickheads in the ring.
[116:56.01]And the Earth Serpent's going to come out next.
[116:57.45]A big, huge dropkick to knock the jermaMoon out.
[117:04.79]And that makes it even more of a probability, high chance, that a Serpent will win the Rumble.
[117:10.39]Unless Dr. Roker can say something.
[117:12.24]Nice backflip there on...
[117:15.80]No, no, no, please.
[117:18.92]No elimination from the Water Serpent.
[117:21.54]Stay in, Dr. Oetker.
[117:22.74]Hang on for dear life.
[117:24.10]Do whatever it takes.
[117:25.82]Do whatever it takes.
[117:28.59]Huge sweet chin music onto Paul Bearer.
[117:31.97]Thankfully, he stays in.
[117:35.75]And I think this is... We're gonna see.
[117:38.61]Paul Bearer's going out here.
[117:39.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[117:47.79]Get rid of him.
[117:49.71]He keeps doing the same moves.
[117:52.51]He keeps doing the kick and then the backflip.
[117:55.47]Oh my god.
[117:57.75]If the Serpent's going to crash the game manually, I'm scared the game's going to crash anyways.
[118:02.36]It got to like this point last time and crashed.
[118:05.38]Big DDT there under Dr. Roker.
[118:09.36]Accidentally, the Time Serpent seems to have, by mistake, stomped on his friend.
[118:14.95]And filling up the ring at number 6 is going to be Orson Welles!
[118:18.69]Who immediately gets picked up by the Serpent.
[118:22.60]And gets thrown into the corner and is still a missing corner.
[118:27.02]I'm surprised nobody's utilized the bare corner in the bottom right yet.
[118:31.90]After Lorag took it out.
[118:34.48]No one has seemed to have gone back to it.
[118:37.04]A big Luthez Press.
[118:39.24]That's not what the move was, but that was kind of like the Luthez Press.
[118:43.14]Water Serpent has an opportunity to get eliminated here by Dr. Roker.
[118:46.46]Can we see the fire come back?
[118:48.44]Can we see the intensity from Dr. Roker return?
[118:50.62]I think we can.
[118:52.51]That's the first elimination from Dr. Roker.
[118:55.33]Hopefully of many.
[118:57.65]And Dr. Roker just overhead pressed Paul Bearer from a guy that's... And then he fell down.
[119:02.35]And he fell down.
[119:03.61]It's okay.
[119:03.97]He's going to get back up.
[119:05.71]Sluggo is going to jump on him.
[119:07.63]Maybe he'll do another backflip.
[119:12.52]Big, no, big reversal from the time Superdome to Orson Welles, who's now picked up in a fireman's carry.
[119:18.60]Dangerously close to those ropes.
[119:19.90]No, gets dropped down, thankfully.
[119:22.54]Thankfully, that was not the case.
[119:26.35]As Dr. Okur hopefully gets some steam.
[119:29.35]Ooh, that's a broken neck.
[119:32.27]When you see that red flask, that means that somebody's hurt bad.
[119:36.85]And they might not make it through the evening.
[119:40.00]Time Serpent is fired up right now.
[119:41.96]Really upset about something.
[119:43.18]I'm not sure what it is.
[119:45.40]No, he's going to go for his patented punches to the face.
[119:49.24]Oh, Orson Welles is fighting him off with a couple of punches to the head.
[119:51.38]Is he going to stop it?
[119:53.34]Just barely gets out of that.
[119:55.86]Can he scoop him over?
[119:56.70]Please tell me he can.
[119:57.64]No, he can't.
[119:58.42]Obviously not.
[119:58.98]He's too big.
[120:02.57]And the next contestant is EZP.
[120:06.91]Coming in kind of late.
[120:08.01]EZP makes his appearance.
[120:09.98]Welcome back, Easy Pete from Fallout New Vegas.
[120:15.75]Can he get rid of Paul Bearer right when he comes in?
[120:19.93]Oh boy, yeah, there goes Paul Bearer.
[120:21.93]Easy Pete with elimination.
[120:24.03]Back to the locker room you go.
[120:25.31]Thanks, another standing moonsault.
[120:28.56]That's his favorite move as the Time Serpent is slowly but surely...
[120:33.41]About to eliminate Orson Welles.
[120:36.11]Those right hooks are fucking crazy.
[120:39.36]That's how you get eliminated by the Time Serpent.
[120:42.00]He punches you in the face five times and then you fall over the top ropes.
[120:47.56]That's Easy Pete now.
[120:48.60]He's scooping up Sluggo and hooking his arm now.
[120:52.95]Maybe a suplex.
[120:53.67]Yep, just a standard suplex.
[120:55.07]Nothing too fancy.
[120:57.33]Nothing too wild.
[120:58.71]I say that as he gets on the top rope and just sits on him.
[121:01.83]He just sits and drags him.
[121:03.93]He just glitched him over to the other side of the ring and now he's just choking but just strangling.
[121:10.71]Pretty intense move by EZP.
[121:16.19]Time Serpent has been here for a long time.
[121:19.17]Dr. Oker's been here for a long time now at least.
[121:21.34]And there's the push-ups again.
[121:22.88]Orson Welles doing push-ups on his back.
[121:26.00]Adding insult to injury.
[121:28.95]And EZP, we might see the elimination of... Sluggo.
[121:34.14]It could happen.
[121:34.98]He's really close.
[121:37.90]As Flanker comes in, he's going to get... There goes the time serpent.
[121:43.72]Time Serpent has been eliminated.
[121:45.50]And so has Sluggo.
[121:46.52]Sluggo also in there.
[121:47.70]We didn't get to see what happened.
[121:49.22]I think Easy Pete might have actually got rid of him, but now Flanker's in here, got Dr. Oker off guard.
[121:56.80]Orson Welles is now just doing another push-up, but this time he's doing one-handed push-ups.
[122:03.35]Four in the ring.
[122:04.95]Flanker, Dr. Oker, Orson Welles, and Easy Pete.
[122:09.77]Just grabbing him by the tendrils on his hair there.
[122:13.03]And doing punches over and over again to the back of the skull.
[122:15.41]Right in his medulla oblongata.
[122:17.23]That's gotta be painful.
[122:18.71]Slamming his head onto the concrete.
[122:20.19]That's concrete, by the way.
[122:21.91]In the Jerma Wrestling Federation, we use concrete.
[122:24.67]That's not a regular ring.
[122:26.94]Trips him up there with a little sweep.
[122:29.42]Orson Welles.
[122:30.98]Maybe a somersault slam, whatever the hell that was.
[122:34.06]And flanker now.
[122:36.04]Has an opportunity to, oh, instantly reverse.
[122:39.06]Dr. Roker is in no shape to be eliminated right now.
[122:42.58]He's still doing pretty well.
[122:44.64]Still has plenty of energy.
[122:46.38]I said that and immediately he gets eliminated.
[122:48.98]Unbelievable.
[122:51.53]the sheer strength of will on Dr. Oker's pizza.
[122:57.17]And he's gonna turn the tables.
[122:58.88]He turns the tables immediately after getting almost a nil.
[123:01.08]And here comes the Snattercat.
[123:02.08]Snattercat's in the ring now.
[123:03.62]Just praying.
[123:04.30]Nobody can see him.
[123:05.26]He's invisible right now.
[123:06.30]Nobody knows where he is.
[123:07.58]They can't even tell he's there.
[123:10.15]And that's how you make a reversal.
[123:12.17]That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you turn the tide of an entire game.
[123:18.95]As the Snattercat now makes himself visible to Orson Welles.
[123:23.33]Who is in a little bit of trouble here.
[123:27.20]Orson Welles.
[123:28.98]Oh, big backwards elbow there.
[123:31.42]Took him off guard.
[123:32.12]Thought he was... Ah, it didn't matter.
[123:34.34]Doesn't matter.
[123:35.48]Go ahead.
[123:36.66]Try to reverse, Dr. Roker.
[123:38.36]You're going to get destroyed.
[123:39.24]Listen to this crowd.
[123:40.70]They are so behind him right now.
[123:44.49]And the Snattercat...
[123:46.49]Oh shit, here comes another Serpent!
[123:48.21]It's the Air Serpent!
[123:50.89]Hopefully they- Wait.
[123:52.77]Oh no.
[123:54.33]Uh.
[123:55.56]Guys, I think there's like three more Serpents left.
[123:57.50]Is Orson Welles gets a dropkick?
[123:59.10]No!
[123:59.68]He's still in it.
[124:01.94]He's still in.
[124:03.70]Orson Welles is still in it after a huge Snaticat dropkick.
[124:08.70]He gets up with a chin buster.
[124:11.22]Orson is still okay.
[124:12.50]Everybody that had the money on Orson, don't worry.
[124:14.12]He's still in it.
[124:14.72]He's kissing the elbow.
[124:18.63]Might get to see another elimination here.
[124:20.37]Could see a easy Pete elimination.
[124:23.73]It's possible.
[124:26.51]I think it's possible he took push-ups again.
[124:29.93]You know, you could take that opportunity to attack him.
[124:32.82]Why fucking keep doing that?
[124:35.24]And here comes the Tooth Goblin.
[124:37.58]The Air Serpent was not happy about that one.
[124:39.60]The Air Serpent is really fucking pissed off.
[124:41.84]He's just in a bit of rage.
[124:44.12]He's seeing red right now for the Tooth Goblin.
[124:46.68]He hates this fucking spell.
[124:48.62]He's just destroying it right now.
[124:50.72]He came in the ring like a bull in a China shop.
[124:52.87]Just started smashing.
[124:55.65]Just stomping him now.
[124:58.29]The Anor Lander, like we said last time, must have casted Gob backstage.
[125:02.15]Sincerely pissing off the Air Serpent.
[125:05.58]As I look at the top of your screen now, we have an opportunity for... That's it!
[125:08.28]See you later, Easy Pete!
[125:09.30]That's an elimination!
[125:11.08]That's another elimination for Dr. Roker!
[125:15.15]Huge!
[125:16.53]Huge carrying slam there onto the Goblin, the Tooth Goblin.
[125:22.47]As he goes down... Easy Pete is gone.
[125:29.23]Oh, Jermania.
[125:30.11]The Serpent Edition.
[125:31.33]I know, pretty much.
[125:33.17]At this point.
[125:37.00]The Snattercat's gonna be gone here.
[125:38.38]He got eliminated the same way he did last time.
[125:43.69]He's just too big, so you just run into him.
[125:46.69]Orson Welles with the elimination onto the Snattercat.
[125:48.85]Can we see it again?
[125:50.96]Does Orson have the momentum to do something like that again?
[125:58.63]How do you pick him up?
[126:00.27]How can you have that much energy to do this?
[126:05.61]He's wicked into doing push-ups.
[126:07.93]Whether on top of somebody, next to somebody, while they're in his hands.
[126:15.79]Oh, the goblin.
[126:16.85]The tooth goblin has an opportunity.
[126:18.50]No, instantly reversed.
[126:20.40]Dr. Roker's not taking that shit.
[126:23.70]In comes the next contestant.
[126:27.30]It's James Madison!
[126:29.32]James Madison, with his appearance, came in around the same time last time.
[126:34.38]Somewhat so.
[126:35.88]Snap suplex there, right under Orson Welles.
[126:38.56]The 7th or 8th, 9th... Whatever fucking president he was.
[126:42.90]He was like a 9th president or something.
[126:45.58]He's gotta be a president.
[126:46.68]That's the president.
[126:47.34]There he is.
[126:49.02]Sidewalk slam there onto the Tooth Goblin by Dr. Oaker.
[126:53.67]While the Air Serpent is currently...
[126:56.34]No, he's... Alright, he just jumped and landed on top.
[126:59.16]He did a bulldog, I think that was, to Orson Welles.
[127:06.87]Who just punched the air serpent?
[127:10.35]I don't know.
[127:10.81]The air serpent's crawling now, as if he's got no legs.
[127:14.07]Alright, here he is!
[127:15.85]Here he is!
[127:16.71]Here's the guy.
[127:17.19]I have no idea who the fuck he is.
[127:19.07]Here he is!
[127:22.25]Here's the mystery guy.
[127:24.41]Crash incoming.
[127:25.55]If it's going to happen, it's going to happen like right now.
[127:27.25]And if it happens, I'm going to be fucking mad.
[127:31.49]As Mystery Man is now in the ring.
[127:33.95]As James Madison has Orson Welles.
[127:36.57]And Orson Welles is gone.
[127:37.49]That is a big right hook into Orson Welles' face.
[127:42.86]Wasn't... And somehow Dr. Ocher found himself onto the ground.
[127:47.85]The Air Serpent, Dr. Ochre, James Madison, Mystery Man, and Tooth Goblin.
[127:55.61]Currently in the ring.
[127:59.34]And the Tooth Goblin's gone.
[128:00.50]Mystery Man eliminates it.
[128:01.82]He better not fucking win.
[128:05.46]Mystery Man takes care of Tooth Goblin while the Air Serpent now seems to be in a little bit of a problem here.
[128:13.87]He's getting his chest pushed.
[128:16.19]He's getting his stomach smelled by Dr. Roker.
[128:21.91]And that's... No!
[128:23.27]Apparently the air serpent still stays in, but is he though?
[128:27.94]Can you stay in with the relentless assault that is Dr. Roker?
[128:33.52]Tried it before, tried it again.
[128:36.35]Doesn't look like he's gonna get it this time.
[128:37.97]Sorry Dr. Oka, but... Nice right hand, he's gonna get it this time possibly.
[128:41.87]Again with the chest push.
[128:44.39]He gets stomped in his tracks.
[128:46.33]Fortunately.
[128:47.69]And here comes Frogman.
[128:49.46]Frogman from Dark Souls 3.
[128:52.32]In a very good position here.
[128:56.96]No... Ooh!
[128:58.48]And somehow... Somehow the Mystery Man... Accidentally ran into the Air Serpent's back.
[129:04.20]Preventing him from eliminating Dr. Oka.
[129:12.09]Hang on, you potato console.
[129:15.89]I know, really.
[129:16.65]I'm so scared.
[129:19.09]As Frogman, as quickly as he comes in, might get... No, the Mystery Man can't eliminate Frogman.
[129:25.12]He has two.
[129:25.74]Yeah, he's got too many points in, like, Strength and Vitality.
[129:29.10]Look at that.
[129:29.50]No, he gets reversed.
[129:31.82]And in comes... Potentially number 16 or 17.
[129:34.22]It's the Earth Serpent!
[129:37.77]Earth Serpent James Madison catches the Earth Serpent right off the bat.
[129:41.09]Please, instantly eliminate him.
[129:43.61]Come on.
[129:43.95]That would have been so perfect.
[129:48.65]Come on, you potato console.
[129:52.63]James Madison now on the other receiving end of the Earth Serpent.
[129:58.04]Stays in it once again.
[130:00.70]He's got him on like a rock bottom.
[130:01.88]No, he's hooking the leg.
[130:02.66]This looks like a Tiger Suplex.
[130:05.08]That was beautiful.
[130:07.30]Come on, James Madison, stop the Air Serpent!
[130:10.46]Run him into the Air Serpent!
[130:12.48]Come on, James Madison!
[130:15.18]Go!
[130:15.64]Don't let him eliminate Dr. Oetker!
[130:18.34]He has to stay in until at least like the final four.
[130:21.86]Yes, he's still in.
[130:25.30]And there goes... Oh my god!
[130:27.40]Oh!
[130:29.62]No, I thought he was gonna fall the other way.
[130:32.66]James Madison just got thrown across the whole entire ring.
[130:39.73]That was a fun... And there's the Mystery Man just kind of hanging out Well, who's on the other side of those ropes?
[130:46.43]Ooh!
[130:47.53]Barely, the Earth Serpent hangs on again for dear life How long has the Mystery Man been on the ground?
[130:56.09]I haven't even been paying attention Big Russian leg sweep there No, the Earth Serpent has a chance Come on, Frogman!
[131:05.82]Oh, that's it for Dr. Roetker!
[131:10.62]With one punch, the longest standing man in the ring is gone.
[131:14.22]With two serpents in the ring.
[131:16.83]James Madison on the top ropes.
[131:19.05]We've got to get some of these serpents out of him.
[131:20.65]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[131:22.75]He just picked up the Mystery Man and just broke his neck.
[131:28.87]Big chin buster there.
[131:33.30]That's 20-0 DDT onto Frogman from James Madison.
[131:38.66]Nice reversal from the Mystery Man.
[131:42.87]I'm not even sure what the fuck is happening.
[131:46.94]But that was a move that he just did.
[131:48.70]He just did a move.
[131:52.62]There it was.
[131:54.90]He turned himself into one of those swing rides at the fair.
[132:00.45]Now just being choked from behind.
[132:02.67]Turning his head into a vice.
[132:04.77]Oh!
[132:06.47]That looks like it's going to be it for James Madison.
[132:10.20]He got his head squished like a grape.
[132:13.22]And the Air Serpent is currently in a rage in that corner.
[132:19.78]Crash for Oetker.
[132:23.08]No, don't say that.
[132:24.83]Come on, stay in James.
[132:25.93]Frogman has just been looking.
[132:27.67]Frogman has been staring the whole time.
[132:31.15]And here comes the Anilander.
[132:33.62]If there's a guy that can take out these two serpents, it's the Anor Lander.
[132:38.90]No, Frogman's gonna Luth-S press him.
[132:41.26]Off the top rope.
[132:43.30]Come on, we gotta pray for the Anor Lander here, guys.
[132:45.94]He's gotta eliminate both the serpents.
[132:48.88]Frogman snapped out of his trance and decided to attack the Anor Lander.
[132:53.99]James Madison still holds on for dear life.
[132:56.05]Still in it.
[132:56.97]Still fighting.
[132:58.17]And I think there's another serpent that's gonna come in.
[133:07.29]I can't believe James Madison is not out.
[133:10.51]Brockman on the top rope.
[133:11.71]Big knee smash.
[133:15.07]The mystery man.
[133:16.76]Here we go.
[133:17.32]This is why James Madison was the 14th president of the United States.
[133:22.40]That's how you get it done.
[133:23.32]He's going to do it.
[133:24.42]Come on.
[133:25.22]Do it.
[133:26.04]Do it.
[133:27.26]James Madison eliminates the air serpent.
[133:30.75]With extreme finesse.
[133:32.39]Thank God for our 14th president.
[133:35.31]Our 12th president of the United States.
[133:39.78]And we might very quickly see the Earth Serpent follow him out.
[133:42.42]No.
[133:43.82]Still in it is the Earth Serpent, but gets reversed.
[133:49.68]And Frogman has been taking a toll onto the Anor Lander.
[133:55.29]Big time.
[133:57.13]And finally, our fuckin' forty-twentieth, forty-twentieth president.
[134:01.68]Forty- What the fuck was that?
[134:13.76]Oh shit.
[134:24.60]And Frogman just tosses James Madison over the top rope.
[134:33.37]Oh, big right hand from the Annalander.
[134:35.99]Not very many people are going to continue to come in.
[134:39.45]Here comes one of the final probably five people.
[134:43.05]Who is it?
[134:45.24]Who is it going to be?
[134:47.54]Who is it going to be?
[134:50.26]Oh, wait a minute.
[134:52.18]That's Widowmaker from Overwatch!
[134:58.23]And there goes the sword!
[135:07.40]He's got Widowmaker from Overwatch making her debut!
[135:12.23]Make her debut into the Jerma wrestling arena.
[135:15.63]Welcome Widowmaker.
[135:17.26]Widowmaker is going to be gone instantly.
[135:20.28]The Annalander.
[135:21.54]Who's coming in next?
[135:41.41]Oh no, it's the Fire Serpent!
[135:44.27]Comes in and beat Hurricane, what the fuck?
[135:46.97]Two of these guys are gonna win.
[135:49.14]It's one of these guys that's gonna win.
[135:51.06]The Mystery Man, or the Fire Serpent.
[135:56.04]I think this is it.
[135:56.76]This is the final four, right?
[135:58.20]Or is there one more Serpent that hasn't come in?
[136:06.57]Ah, damn it.
[136:10.84]I was hoping that Widowmaker was going to be in there for a little longer.
[136:13.76]Widowmaker on offense.
[136:17.37]As Frogman picks up the Anilander.
[136:20.63]Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe that these are your final four.
[136:26.13]I think these are your final four.
[136:28.85]Frogman, the Anilander, random default mystery guy, and the Fire Serpent.
[136:34.24]I really wish that the Anilander and Frogman...
[136:37.69]would fucking stop fighting each other and eliminate these two fucking idiots on the right.
[136:43.84]Okay, eliminate him.
[136:44.90]Get rid of the mystery guy.
[136:47.26]Please.
[136:48.50]Serpent, please toss him over.
[136:51.06]Get rid of him.
[136:53.46]Oh, this is it.
[136:54.52]Yes.
[136:55.30]Yes, thank God.
[136:56.56]The random default mystery guy that I didn't make.
[137:00.38]And now we're down to three.
[137:02.12]Now we're down to two.
[137:04.42]Ladies and gentlemen.
[137:06.41]Jerma RUMBLE STREAM EDITION.
[137:09.21]THE ANALANDER VERSUS THE FIRE SERPENT.
[137:12.37]THESE TWO HAVE HISTORY.
