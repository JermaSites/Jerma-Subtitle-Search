[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.98]Alright, here we go.
[00:08.12]Open it up.
[00:09.13]Here comes a loud noise.
[00:11.79]Be careful.
[00:14.85]Loud, loud, loud.
[00:15.85]Probably, I can't help it.
[00:17.25]Sorry.
[00:17.99]Here it comes.
[00:20.43]Here it is.
[00:22.73]I told ya.
[00:24.40]I told ya.
[00:25.06]I warned ya.
[00:30.31]There it is.
[00:31.09]Hey, look at that.
[00:33.55]Let's get Etalyx in here.
[00:37.79]Hi, Etalyx.
[00:40.65]Oh, yeah.
[00:40.99]Hello.
[00:41.31]What's up?
[00:44.69]So we're going to try to get the good ending.
[00:48.07]Okay.
[00:49.53]I tried to warn you guys that this is a video game that was released in 2017.
[00:54.81]All game developers don't understand and not have their splash screens at maximum volume.
[01:03.27]Just so we're aware.
[01:04.81]Alright, new game.
[01:09.09]You know how it works.
[01:10.96]This game again.
[01:12.06]Laughing my ass off.
[01:13.02]Yes.
[01:15.14]If you had watched the previous three hours of this stream, you know why we're here.
[01:21.98]Why are we here again?
[01:25.32]Because... I don't know.
[01:26.74]Why are we here again?
[01:28.12]Why are we here again?
[01:31.26]You guys already know how this works.
[01:34.31]Alex doesn't, though.
[01:38.97]How come Steam doesn't have a screen share that's one-to-one yet?
[01:41.63]I wish.
[01:42.91]Why is Skype, after five years, still the only company that can do that?
[01:48.28]I don't know.
[01:48.76]I can't believe we're doing this again.
[01:52.96]Why are we here?
[01:55.11]We're getting, like, fucking flashbacks.
[02:09.62]But yeah.
[02:14.56]It's like when I went to see John Wick.
[02:16.22]It was a good movie.
[02:17.54]And then my friend wanted to see it.
[02:19.42]Okay.
[02:20.34]Watch it a second time.
[02:21.72]Now my uncle wants to see it.
[02:23.92]Oh, why didn't you go with us the first time?
[02:25.40]No?
[02:25.62]We're going to go see it a third time.
[02:27.14]It's just watching a movie with friends more than once.
[02:30.97]I already know what happens to this guy.
[02:33.84]He ends up shooting the old guy in the end.
[02:35.30]Oh, wait.
[02:35.72]Oh, fuck.
[02:36.56]People that, like, weren't here.
[02:40.09]Thank you, elike18, for the five bucks.
[02:42.19]I cannot do six seconds of facecam because the facecam is not plugged.
[02:46.34]Selfless!
[02:46.86]Selfless.
[02:47.94]Selfless.
[02:48.28]I was selfish last time.
[02:51.11]Wait, selfless or selfish?
[02:53.03]I was shellfish last time.
[02:56.89]I'm selfless this time.
[03:01.41]The music is so loud that you can't hear anything anyone's saying.
[03:08.16]It's okay.
[03:08.56]I'm going to have to watch it on mute.
[03:10.62]30 seconds behind you to participate.
[03:14.38]I only read subtitles.
[03:15.94]This guy will be good.
[03:16.76]We're going to help this guy.
[03:22.00]Yep, I helped him.
[03:27.51]I think I lost connection to chat, but that's okay.
[03:30.61]Let's see.
[03:36.73]So what happens if you don't make a decision?
[03:39.32]I have no idea actually.
[03:40.28]I've never even tried that.
[03:44.20]Wait for like a really important seeming moment.
[03:48.46]Wait, what did I do last time here?
[03:49.52]Apparently there's like seven different endings and there's like dozens of chapters I didn't even see.
[03:57.20]Why does my stream say more battles ultimate epic battle simulator?
[04:03.31]What?
[04:06.67]It does not say that.
[04:07.71]It says going for good endings.
[04:10.65]Why does mine say that?
[04:14.31]There's no music.
[04:14.83]That means I can turn the volume back up.
[04:17.52]There we go.
[04:20.75]Wait, didn't he have a red shirt on before?
[04:35.16]I'm not even kidding, guys.
[04:35.94]He didn't have a fucking red shirt on before.
[04:37.38]That means he's gonna die.
[04:39.80]This is new.
[04:40.97]They did this more than once.
[04:41.65]That guy's gonna die, right?
[04:42.71]This guy?
[04:43.09]They've all got red shirts.
[04:45.25]No, don't spoil it for everybody.
[04:48.50]The most meaningful relationship I've ever had in my life.
[04:51.42]Who wears a red vest anyway?
[04:53.04]I don't know.
[04:56.58]Unless you're a valet.
[04:57.70]Is he a valet?
[04:58.56]Yeah.
[04:59.90]He didn't have a red shirt before.
[05:01.64]Look.
[05:03.42]He did?
[05:03.88]No, he did not.
[05:06.16]He had like a fucking green shirt on.
[05:14.22]I can't fucking believe we're doing this again.
[05:18.47]Hey, you did this.
[05:21.33]Why is this so low?
[05:26.86]I can't believe we're doing it again.
[05:28.16]I'm just getting such deja vu from yesterday.
[05:33.74]You can leave the keys with me, sir.
[05:34.98]I'll park the car for you.
[05:36.08]I'm not the driver, son.
[05:38.62]Okay, so this time I'm going to talk to this girl.
[05:40.62]No problem.
[05:43.04]No tip.
[05:45.14]Fuck.
[05:46.40]Thank you.
[05:47.29]This is technically a game.
[05:55.59]We're gonna take the money.
[05:57.96]So what you have to do now is figure out exactly how much of it was the same.
[06:08.78]I know, right?
[06:09.86]Well, it was all exactly the same up until this point.
[06:12.63]Helping the guy from the train means absolutely fucking nothing, apparently.
[06:16.88]Maybe he comes back later.
[06:18.22]I would laugh my ass off if he comes back, because there's very specific points where he might come back, and that's really funny.
[06:24.46]Should I push her for the... Well, we can get... We know we can get 300.
[06:26.71]We just have to go.
[06:29.43]No, don't think so.
[06:30.99]Keep walking, mate.
[06:33.29]So what's better, this game or the last Telltale game you played?
[06:35.85]This.
[06:36.75]The last Telltale game.
[06:48.97]Yeah, he does have a nice car.
[06:52.55]Give me 200.
[06:54.49]I'm reading nuclear physics.
[06:57.15]I made that joke last time.
[06:58.21]We're going to do that again.
[06:58.95]I'm a chemical engineer.
[07:00.83]Can I help you with something?
[07:05.37]12.5 million?
[07:05.91]No, this time we're not going there.
[07:07.11]She's going to get them instantly.
[07:08.85]I didn't see it last time.
[07:10.06]It's new to me.
[07:28.94]I'm just gonna do the whole stream I did on Tuesday.
[07:31.38]And, like, some of you guys weren't here on Tuesday, you're gonna, like, I'm gonna get some laughs.
[07:34.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, why?
[07:37.85]I wanna know why you need the car.
[07:39.47]We don't need to worry about that.
[07:41.27]Fine.
[07:41.43]I won't.
[07:41.99]Dude, you talk about, like, a double-dip stream.
[07:45.75]Like, I'm just doing the same stream.
[07:48.69]Hey, guess what?
[07:49.19]We're streaming tomorrow, people.
[07:50.56]That's right.
[07:51.76]We're getting another ending in Late Shift.
[07:55.66]100 going for 100% completion.
[07:59.18]Tuesday, restream.
[08:00.58]200.
[08:00.64]Can't refund this game anymore.
[08:04.13]I can get 200.
[08:04.57]Deal.
[08:04.81]I know it.
[08:09.61]Okay, here we go.
[08:10.23]Here she goes.
[08:23.43]So remember, everybody has a gun in this game, so don't get in anybody's car.
[08:29.90]This is new content.
[08:33.61]What?
[08:34.83]Check the TV.
[08:36.11]I didn't do that last time.
[08:39.78]So what did you just make a deal for?
[08:40.80]To let her take the Maserati.
[08:44.10]Okay, so you just traded a car worth how much money?
[08:47.42]For like $200?
[08:48.38]Yeah.
[08:50.48]Best deal she's ever made in her whole life.
[08:53.47]Alright, like clearly there was a guy there.
[08:54.85]Let's go check.
[08:55.43]She's still here.
[08:58.89]She's still here.
[08:59.33]Should I like listen to this guy this time?
[09:10.47]All clear to be.
[09:16.72]Okay, yep, he goes.
[09:17.56]We're gonna be complete.
[09:22.98]We're gonna comply completely.
[09:29.59]Just doing the same thing.
[09:33.69]I better not get the fucking bad ending.
[09:36.29]I'm dropping it.
[09:38.46]So do we have a gun counter?
[09:39.92]In the mod, do you have a gun counter?
[09:42.45]I think so.
[09:43.67]There's like nine guns in this movie, and it's different people holding them.
[09:48.71]No, it's probably like the same prop, though.
[09:51.07]Does it look like I can drive?
[09:54.42]Run?
[09:54.62]No, I ran last time.
[09:57.52]You want me to drive you out of here?
[09:58.88]That's exactly what you're gonna do.
[10:05.98]It's really stupid that I'm doing this again.
[10:07.98]Well, it's either this or I was going to turn the stream off 15 minutes ago.
[10:12.84]So, I'm doing this to, like, just because I feel like it.
[10:18.69]So, it's either we're doing late shift or I was going to turn off the stream.
[10:34.07]I did this last time.
[10:44.40]Okay, let me do it.
[10:45.80]Let me turn around and run again.
[10:46.90]It's the same stream.
[10:50.65]It's the same stream.
[10:56.11]Nothing has changed.
[10:58.71]Alright, this is new.
[10:59.39]This is new content.
[11:05.86]Okay.
[11:08.46]Last time we got in another guy's car.
[11:14.95]There's no difference so far.
[11:17.33]Are we sure this movie isn't just a big BMW advertisement?
[11:20.27]It might be.
[11:23.13]Because they actually have movies.
[11:24.61]I don't know if you knew that.
[11:27.01]Really?
[11:27.69]Like these bigger car companies, they hire directors.
[11:30.17]Like real movie directors.
[11:32.49]To make movies for their car.
[11:34.47]I hope I can run...
[11:37.49]No.
[11:37.79]90% chance that I can run.
[11:40.35]Okay.
[11:57.24]Are you serious?
[11:58.44]What the fuck was that?
[12:00.82]What was that attempt?
[12:02.86]What was that attempt?
[12:04.36]That was so lame.
[12:05.74]He was, like, just barely trying to... Oh, my, come on.
[12:11.63]Where's my decision?
[12:16.91]I just, like, snaked myself up there.
[12:20.01]Okay.
[12:26.18]Dex check failed Dex Dex check failed That was what we just said that I was fucking hysterical idea of a slick operation Dripping DNA over the place I've got the car tonight.
[12:44.59]It's outside.
[12:45.73]Uh Where's the other guy Jesus Christ?
[12:49.87]Who the hell's gonna drive is you're clearly not I'll be alright fucking idiot.
[12:53.67]Oh
[12:55.30]Okay.
[12:56.32]It has to be four people.
[12:57.34]There is no way you can manage the auction assistant and everyone downstairs.
[13:01.06]He was right.
[13:01.44]He didn't get shot.
[13:02.04]That's right.
[13:02.74]Do you want to tell Mr. Wu that we missed the one chance to get our hands on his fucking rice ball?
[13:07.00]Because I don't.
[13:07.94]We have one window of opportunity and we're going to use it.
[13:10.96]Fine.
[13:12.42]How?
[13:14.34]Leave him to bleed.
[13:17.19]Next time I almost got syringed and it didn't matter.
[13:19.69]Call Danny if he doesn't pick up.
[13:20.85]Try and get hold of that Irish Pete.
[13:24.52]The romantic interest, we're gonna see what happens.
[13:27.19]Hopefully I don't have to like cut the stream.
[13:31.49]That's the one part that I saw.
[13:34.15]Yep, he's gonna pick the one that makes it so he has to turn off the stream.
[13:37.97]Uh oh.
[13:52.91]Didn't oh, yeah, they're right that this is like that.
[13:55.77]This is the yeah, I get syringed No, he has to dry it I'm doing math again Stick a fucking syringe at me
[14:22.66]Oh my god.
[14:25.20]Maths.
[14:25.96]Here comes more percentages.
[14:29.24]Dude, how do I get just stuck?
[14:30.76]That'd be so funny.
[14:32.00]I wonder if there's a way to make it so they all don't die in the car accident.
[14:48.10]Spoiler Etalyx.
[14:49.60]They all die in a car accident in five seconds.
[14:54.10]You know, what well-developed characters these guys are.
[14:56.64]You really feel attached to them before they go.
[14:59.16]This is what's going to happen.
[15:05.93]Spoilers.
[15:06.49]What do you mean spoilers?
[15:08.61]We just did this fucking two days ago.
[15:10.51]Okay, we need to get moving.
[15:13.61]We need to be at the auction house before nine.
[15:17.64]Alright, how do I... I'm gonna try to make it so nobody dies here.
[15:20.66]Because last time everyone... I'm gonna try.
[15:22.52]So here we go.
[15:25.20]This guy turns around and starts talking to us in the backseat and drives and kills us all.
[15:30.59]Let's see if that's a way... Let's see if I can change that.
[15:35.05]I'm gonna stay calm.
[15:38.15]Wait, that doesn't happen right now, right?
[15:53.14]Don't sound the alarm.
[15:54.04]Yeah, like that did a lot of dumb shit.
[15:59.61]It's not yet idiot.
[16:00.83]It's after the heist.
[16:02.21]What?
[16:04.57]Sorry I didn't remember this shitty movie we watched two days ago.
[16:07.21]I think you need to tell me what we're doing here.
[16:09.39]Nerve going already?
[16:10.73]Just like to be prepared, that's all.
[16:12.76]A very powerful Chinese clan called the Choiza are here tonight to reacquire a porcelain ball that has been in the possession of their family for over a thousand years.
[16:21.30]Reacquire?
[16:22.24]What went wrong?
[16:26.55]Shitty.
[16:30.29]This part looks like they saw that one scene in Mission Impossible 3.
[16:32.79]Where they drive all the cars up to that roundabout with the doors winged open.
[16:37.90]They're like, yeah, let's make that.
[16:43.40]Alright, now we actually have decisions to make here.
[16:48.52]This is where it starts.
[16:51.25]This is what the music empowers everything else to.
[16:53.99]You can't even hear it.
[16:54.77]We're stealing from people who are prepared to spend millions on a piece of pottery when there are far more worthy causes in the world.
[17:01.20]What on your worthy cause are you?
[17:03.30]Tonight, I am.
[17:05.64]Sure.
[17:06.98]Yeah.
[17:08.36]Yeah, I guess you could see it that way.
[17:10.34]You know, maybe you've got a point about relieving some people... Alright, right here it says... Oh, she liked that!
[17:14.15]It's like a telltale thing.
[17:18.39]Okay.
[17:18.59]Okay.
[17:22.78]Welcome to Hainsworth.
[17:24.22]The second part of the auction has just begun.
[17:26.11]So, this time, I'm not going to... I'm going to tell her to stop.
[17:29.53]Thank you.
[17:36.07]910 to my left.
[17:36.73]Thank you, sir.
[17:37.29]910.
[17:37.69]Everyone has seen all those things.
[17:41.62]920.
[17:41.78]Thank you.
[17:42.50]I see you.
[17:43.16]So, Etalyx, like, during this whole thing, I was, like, making all kinds of jokes.
[17:46.40]I was making all kinds of, like, quips.
[17:47.82]Mm-hmm.
[17:49.40]Second time around, it doesn't quite... No, second time around, we're just trying to see what happens.
[17:54.57]Oh, hello!
[17:55.15]I did that too, remember?
[17:56.37]Fair warning.
[17:57.89]I'm selling $9.50 once, $9.50 twice.
[18:03.54]The best thing about me not being able to hear is that the subtitles are way off.
[18:07.34]Are they?
[18:08.52]Are they?
[18:08.72]They're kind of off, yeah.
[18:11.08]I wouldn't spend it on a fucking sideboard.
[18:18.49]Oh, fuck, I missed it!
[18:19.41]I forgot, I was like, oh, did you?
[18:20.85]Oh, I missed it.
[18:21.29]Remember that gram?
[18:22.99]What a classic gram.
[18:23.97]247.
[18:23.99]342?
[18:24.15]I swear to God, if they say something's 342, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[18:27.20]It's the old guy.
[18:45.06]I like how that number has risen to significance for some reason.
[18:50.98]I don't know why.
[18:52.30]I don't know.
[18:52.58]So I'm going to stop her this time.
[19:05.35]Because last time I just let her do whatever the hell she wanted.
[19:07.71]This time I'm going to be like, excuse me, don't.
[19:09.29]That guy reminds me of the Kingsman.
[19:12.38]Remember the guy from Kingsman?
[19:13.80]Wasn't that that movie, that good movie that you like?
[19:16.92]Kingsman, right?
[19:17.24]Oh yeah, Kingsman's a great movie.
[19:18.64]That guy reminds me of the guy from Kingsman.
[19:20.28]Kingsman 2 comes out this year.
[19:22.38]That's right.
[19:34.79]And so we should begin the selling.
[19:38.18]Thank you, Katie.
[19:38.86]Thank you, Sebastian.
[19:40.70]Okay, well, we're going to do this because, I mean, why not, right?
[19:46.22]Here's your opportunity.
[19:47.66]Here's your, like, one joke for the stream that's not going to be funny.
[19:51.07]I would like to start the bidding, please, at two million pounds.
[19:57.78]Thank you, madam.
[19:58.36]Two million and a half to my left.
[20:00.30]Three, I'm looking for.
[20:01.26]Do I hear three?
[20:02.06]Oh, yes, you're on the back there.
[20:03.54]Three back there.
[20:04.44]Do I hear four?
[20:06.10]Four?
[20:07.60]Four to the lady.
[20:08.32]Thank you, madam.
[20:09.72]What the fuck are you doing?
[20:10.88]That wasn't him.
[20:13.19]We get 20% of the sale price.
[20:15.83]He's shocked.
[20:16.97]Do I hear six?
[20:18.31]Six, I'm looking for.
[20:19.91]Six to my right.
[20:21.17]How powerful did you say these trikes are?
[20:23.93]Do I hear seven now?
[20:26.11]Seven I have to the lady.
[20:28.38]May I stop bidding?
[20:29.78]It's not him.
[20:33.82]It's not him even talking.
[20:36.35]I don't know who's talking.
[20:40.03]I don't know who's speaking, so it's hard to even know.
[20:41.97]Because I'm just reading.
[20:43.11]Alright.
[20:48.11]Intervene.
[20:50.14]Intervene?
[20:50.96]Yeah.
[20:52.44]What, like take over?
[20:53.92]Like I stop her from bidding.
[20:54.96]Oh.
[20:58.03]She's gonna do it anyways.
[20:59.69]There you go with the math.
[21:00.53]So he buys it.
[21:01.23]Okay.
[21:01.37]So they get it.
[21:02.19]So how do we get it?
[21:02.79]That was the big decision that we didn't make.
[21:32.62]Alright.
[21:33.72]Let's just fucking turn this shit up, man.
[21:34.99]What the hell?
[21:35.65]I can't hear anything.
[21:36.67]Alright, where to?
[21:37.27]The basement.
[21:37.77]Jeffrey's going to call the lift from downstairs.
[21:39.79]Okay, and then?
[21:40.35]Then you're going to take out the security guard.
[21:56.18]Yep.
[21:56.62]The bi-annual Chinese art evening.
[22:00.26]Dude, last time I was such a dope.
[22:02.20]I didn't listen to anybody.
[22:03.52]I was fucking stuff up.
[22:05.49]This time I'm going to be a professional.
[22:06.87]You going to roleplay?
[22:09.63]Yep.
[22:10.17]Do as I'm told.
[22:13.05]She's already touching your shoulder this early into the night.
[22:15.83]She just met you.
[22:16.73]She's already way into you.
[22:18.09]Same stream?
[22:18.73]Oh, I know.
[22:19.55]We're going to be a James Bond tonight.
[22:27.87]Jeremy, you always stole the ball.
[22:28.99]The big heist isn't just win the auction.
[22:31.17]Why are we doing this right now?
[22:33.81]Why the fuck am I doing this?
[22:37.17]Okay, this time.
[22:37.60]I remember this guy gets syringed.
[22:40.38]Last time I just stood up.
[22:41.82]Just say you got lost looking for the box.
[22:59.56]Simon, freeze the guard's image.
[23:01.96]He's not going to believe that.
[23:03.96]I'll handle that.
[23:09.05]36% chance of sex.
[23:13.09]It's on a logarithmic scale.
[23:15.21]I might not get another chance.
[23:16.41]Alright, play along.
[23:19.81]We're going to watch this guy get syringed.
[23:22.35]Okay, Matt, go.
[23:27.05]Here we go.
[23:28.08]Is this guy going to get the same fate?
[23:29.94]What a plain looking sandwich.
[23:31.00]Of course he did.
[23:31.52]He just gets syringed again.
[23:32.40]Here comes the bus boy.
[23:33.91]I remember this too.
[23:34.57]Wait, what?
[23:35.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[23:36.59]What?
[23:56.37]Grab the- I'm gonna do it.
[24:22.62]That guy's face was fucking perfect.
[24:34.86]Alright, we got it.
[24:39.86]Stop resisting arrest.
[24:41.82]We're not like police officers.
[24:47.74]That guy was making the face that you make when you're having a really nice, relaxing, long pee.
[24:54.89]After waking up.
[24:55.89]Okay, both codes simultaneously.
[24:58.21]This better not be 3.2.
[24:59.59]I thought it was gonna be 3.2.
[25:01.27]There's no way. 3.2.
[25:17.35]Last time I did this, I fucked this up on purpose.
[25:19.29]342, 342, 342.
[25:20.01]Alright, no alarm.
[25:20.69]So we're good.
[25:21.53]No, everybody doesn't die.
[25:38.04]These guys are all still, everyone, so this is going good so far, and everyone's still alive.
[25:42.70]Was everyone still alive at this point last time?
[25:45.76]Up here, everybody dies.
[25:51.25]We were all in the same car, and we did like a GTA over the edge.
[25:58.89]Don't even tell me.
[26:01.37]That it doesn't matter.
[26:02.09]And we're still gonna drive off the edge.
[26:05.09]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if that happens.
[26:06.73]He put the seatbelt on.
[26:22.56]We're going up with the medium.
[26:24.44]I can already tell.
[26:25.04]I'm like getting ready.
[26:26.22]Dude, I'm getting ready to laugh.
[26:27.22]I don't even... Right, yeah.
[26:34.01]I'm gonna laugh so hard if we go over the edge.
[26:36.37]And I'm gonna laugh so hard 30 seconds later.
[26:45.64]The high five was gonna crash the car.
[26:50.92]No, I don't think, I don't think they died.
[26:57.87]Right?
[26:58.13]I mean, we're all still okay.
[27:02.25]We made it.
[27:04.31]Everybody lives.
[27:04.85]Okay.
[27:13.15]Here we go.
[27:13.87]We're all getting in the van.
[27:20.53]Okay, this is where we all get in the van.
[27:24.93]Why do we change to the van?
[27:26.37]I don't know.
[27:27.87]Okay.
[27:28.80]Prevent car crash.
[27:31.00]Extremely important.
[27:34.23]Do not let them crash.
[27:37.63]It's like a time travel movie.
[27:38.88]I have to go back and prevent the crash.
[27:40.78]You just gotta keep starting over until you do it.
[27:48.78]This thing's Groundhog Day.
[27:50.92]I have to keep doing it until I get it right.
[27:53.71]Until you pick the right combination of decisioning.
[27:57.83]To prevent everyone's death.
[28:00.73]Okay, yeah, I'm gonna keep quiet.
[28:03.56]Yeah, I'm not gonna like speak up, just like we're gonna calm down.
[28:07.63]No, wait, no!
[28:08.05]Oh no.
[28:30.85]Give high fives into the car.
[28:33.51]I kept quiet last time?
[28:34.71]No, I didn't.
[28:35.17]Wait, exit the game.
[28:36.35]I think you did keep quiet last time.
[28:37.97]Exit game.
[28:39.01]It didn't have a chance to... It didn't have a chance.
[28:42.97]It didn't save it.
[28:44.55]Nice!
[28:44.81]It didn't have a chance.
[28:46.91]We're good.
[28:49.31]It didn't auto-save it.
[28:50.07]We're good.
[28:52.63]We're gonna... This time I'm gonna refuse the high five.
[29:02.11]I did not expect this to go that smoothly.
[29:05.57]Time travel, we have to go back.
[29:10.62]We have to go back.
[29:15.46]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[29:18.46]We have to keep going back.
[29:20.60]This is our punishment.
[29:21.48]This is our hell.
[29:22.10]We have to go back and prevent the crash.
[29:27.88]There's no way to save this.
[29:31.69]Maybe the only reason they look back at you is because you're not talking and they want to know why you're not talking.
[29:42.31]The game crashed.
[29:45.93]Oh no.
[29:47.05]I couldn't prevent the crash!
[29:48.13]The game crashed!
[29:52.73]If you don't save them fast enough... That's unbelievable!
[29:56.35]Everyone is doomed.
[29:57.09]The fucking game crashed!
[29:59.51]I couldn't save them!
[30:00.49]I couldn't save it!
[30:04.41]Hey, just chalk another one up to the technical difficulty string.
[30:08.13]Oh shit!
[30:08.67]I'm so sorry!
[30:16.97]I'm so sorry.
[30:18.23]Resume.
[30:20.85]Okay, we have to prevent the crash.
[30:25.76]Whether that be technical, physical, or metaphorical, we have to prevent the crash.
[30:38.02]Metallics, that is fucking perfect.
[30:40.90]We can't see!
[30:42.06]What?!
[30:42.28]Yeah, it's a black screen.
[30:43.73]Oh, there we go, I got it.
[30:46.07]Stream crashed.
[30:48.99]Okay, no high five.
[30:55.77]I'm such a giggle monster right now.
[30:58.15]I can't even fucking talk.
[31:02.16]This game should not ever crash.
[31:03.62]The game fucking crashes.
[31:04.84]Give me a break.
[31:05.54]It's just a movie.
[31:08.92]It's FMV, which reminds me.
[31:11.28]I saw FMV you should play.
[31:13.84]I got at least a few FMVs I'm going to be playing for sure.
[31:16.52]Okay, I kept quiet this time.
[31:20.75]See what I mean?
[31:23.37]This time I'm going to speak up.
[31:31.60]If you don't high-five, the game crashes.
[31:35.91]Alright, here we go.
[31:37.55]Prevent the crash.
[31:41.77]The only thing I can do is speak up.
[31:43.55]Dude, I find it so funny that they kind of just were like, you know what, we gotta get rid of like six characters.
[31:53.90]Let's just have them drive off a cliff.
[31:57.53]They didn't want to write that much dialog.
[31:59.15]Okay, here we go.
[32:00.77]So my first choice was what?
[32:02.66]Nothing here.
[32:05.04]Nothing there.
[32:06.06]Ladies and gentlemen, we are back in society.
[32:08.86]We're back.
[32:09.76]Yep.
[32:11.82]Here we go.
[32:12.14]Look at my guys.
[32:12.82]My guy's pissed off.
[32:13.94]He's like, ah, fuck, I gotta prevent this crash.
[32:16.18]I'm so sick of this at this point.
[32:17.82]Just wait.
[32:18.64]This thing stays in the bag until we get to Wu's place and he turns it into money.
[32:21.39]Too fucking right.
[32:22.33]Okay.
[32:23.55]Speak up Speak up I assume you failed again
[32:55.31]You can't... You can't prevent... There's no way to prevent the crash.
[33:02.98]Everyone just dies and nothing happens.
[33:04.92]Now that I've seen this three times, can I just say, alright, why is their first instinct to rip it left?
[33:14.73]Yeah, your first instinct is to rip the car left.
[33:18.23]Alright, I gotta go back and save somebody, right?
[33:25.87]No, you have to high five and speak up.
[33:28.24]Alright, last time I had a chance to pull a guy out.
[33:33.80]This guy.
[33:34.30]Let's save this guy.
[33:41.88]Mission failed.
[33:42.54]Alright, this is where I didn't go.
[33:47.75]I didn't save this guy.
[33:51.33]Here we go.
[33:56.26]Got the bag.
[33:59.74]Save him.
[34:03.60]Yep.
[34:04.90]What about the others?
[34:05.78]Didn't I have a chance to turn around and save him?
[34:16.57]Oh, it's her.
[34:17.11]I can take her with me.
[34:30.22]Yep, this is my opportunity.
[34:32.71]I didn't get it right.
[34:42.63]We're going to the police.
[34:46.99]Yeah, last time I said Mr. Will.
[34:49.39]We're going to the police.
[34:50.67]We're going to get the good ending.
[34:53.35]The good guy ending.
[34:54.43]With the good guy.
[34:57.48]Every great Telltale game has one place where they diverge, and you go to two separate areas, and then they all return back to the same one at the end.
[35:07.90]I'm going to the police.
[35:09.90]I'm going to the police.
[35:13.20]Here they come.
[35:13.74]I'm going to be the good guy.
[35:14.52]Good ending.
[35:17.33]Good ending.
[35:18.25]I get to go to the police.
[35:19.13]And they're going to tell them all what happened.
[35:27.20]And it's gonna be, it's gonna be, you did the right thing.
[35:29.66]Good guy ending.
[35:31.87]Right?
[35:35.55]Police are gonna point a gun at you.
[35:36.93]You're walking towards people you know guaranteed have guns.
[35:39.63]Alright, this is brand new content, guys.
[35:41.93]Here we go.
[35:45.06]This is all brand new shit.
[35:50.80]Not yet.
[35:53.58]You alleged someone forced you to steal this.
[35:56.54]Yeah.
[35:57.72]They threatened to drug me.
[35:59.48]Threatened to drug you?
[36:01.46]Convenient.
[36:02.64]I'm telling you the truth.
[36:03.98]This guy's going to pull a gun and be like working for Mr. Wu.
[36:06.48]Like you said.
[36:07.22]Guaranteed.
[36:08.60]He's got the cops in his pocket.
[36:10.08]Guaranteed.
[36:10.40]This robbery occurred over two hours ago.
[36:14.06]Took you a while to locate your conscience, didn't it?
[36:17.09]It's been a complicated night.
[36:19.37]So it seems.
[36:21.21]Exploding vans.
[36:22.77]Chinese Chinaman.
[36:26.48]You know what I think?
[36:28.66]I think you're up to your balls in this.
[36:31.58]But you got scared.
[36:32.64]They were driving for two hours?
[36:34.24]I'm telling you the truth.
[36:38.06]Anyone to back you up?
[36:41.36]Yeah, throw her under the bus.
[36:42.08]There was a girl.
[36:44.44]There was a girl.
[36:44.84]Do you surprise me?
[36:46.26]Throw her under the bus.
[36:48.24]She won't come with me.
[36:49.86]Sounds like the brains of the operation.
[36:53.09]I'm trying to do the right thing here.
[36:55.05]Yeah, why don't you investigate this Mr. Woo?
[36:57.05]Because we work for Mr. Woo.
[36:58.57]Ha ha!
[37:00.01]Gun comes out.
[37:01.05]Watch.
[37:02.31]See?
[37:03.25]Tony Woo is sitting in the room right next to us.
[37:05.13]Told you.
[37:06.05]And he's very convincingly denied any involvement in your little enterprise.
[37:10.66]In fact, when we told him what you stole, he nearly stopped breathing.
[37:17.58]Any thoughts?
[37:19.97]I told you.
[37:21.32]I told you.
[37:22.92]I told you.
[37:25.28]If there's a run option from the police right now, I'm going to fucking laugh.
[37:29.90]Look at this.
[37:30.98]Look at this.
[37:32.48]Look at this.
[37:33.34]And he knows fine well not to fuck with them.
[37:35.59]Look at... I fucking said it.
[37:37.21]I think you didn't realize that until after you stole the bowl.
[37:42.57]And now you're sitting here shitting yourself looking for a way out.
[37:53.56]I want you to talk to somebody.
[37:55.72]Oh, no.
[38:01.68]Who the fuck is this?
[38:02.54]Do you recognize this woman?
[38:04.52]What the fuck is this?
[38:11.19]What do I have here?
[38:12.87]Who the fuck is this?
[38:13.93]Answer her.
[38:14.43]Am I supposed to recognize this person?
[38:16.47]It's the Chinese ball we stole from the auction house tonight.
[38:19.11]No, it's not.
[38:21.62]Even though it fools the eye, I must admit.
[38:24.55]This person did not appear in the story.
[38:25.75]But why rely on an effect called thermoluminescence?
[38:28.81]It's used to determine when the porcelain was fired.
[38:33.01]The bowl was created during the late Ming Dynasty.
[38:35.07]If I could run right now, it would be so funny.
[38:36.43]3258, 342... Oh, it was close! 371.
[38:44.59]Guess that's about right.
[38:46.11]It was so close.
[38:48.43]It was so close.
[38:50.05]371.
[38:50.61]This thing here is less than five years old.
[38:55.35]So where is the original?
[38:59.49]Hey, where is it?
[39:01.27]Fuck.
[39:01.75]The police are in on it.
[39:02.71]Yes, I dare say.
[39:08.36]Start talking.
[39:13.02]To a solicitor, no one else.
[39:18.24]Where's my lawyer?
[39:20.38]Can I get a lawyer on the phone?
[39:21.26]Appreciate you coming down, Ms.
[39:22.48]Tran.
[39:23.48]We'll keep you informed.
[39:29.95]Matthew Thompson.
[39:31.71]That's my name.
[39:32.23]I am arresting you on suspicion of armed robbery.
[39:35.15]What?
[39:38.08]You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something you later lie on in court.
[39:45.97]Anything you do say may be given an answer.
[39:47.89]I'm going to get syringed.
[39:49.05]For the rest of the movie, are you just going to spend time in a jail cell?
[39:52.89]I don't know.
[39:53.39]Are they just going to throw you in jail for the next 45 minutes?
[39:59.01]If this fucking... If this crashes, I swear to God, if this motherfucking van crashes...
[40:07.69]CID at Knightsbridge.
[40:08.97]Don't do it.
[40:09.43]They want you to talk them through the robbery.
[40:10.97]Don't do it.
[40:13.07]If you want my advice, I'd help them do it.
[40:15.89]He's looking.
[40:16.27]He's turning around looking at me.
[40:17.49]Driving.
[40:17.91]Plus points on your record.
[40:19.43]It's going to happen.
[40:22.11]Get a year or two off your sentence.
[40:23.35]It's going to happen, guys.
[40:24.09]I swear to God.
[40:24.51]I can't believe it's come to this.
[40:27.74]Where did I go wrong?
[40:29.26]Where did I make the wrong choice?
[40:30.34]It's going to happen.
[40:34.02]Clive, we see this.
[40:43.45]What the fuck?
[40:45.37]Is it game over?
[40:46.49]No.
[40:47.75]These are the guys that killed me last time.
[40:54.45]These guys like shot the shit out of me last time.
[40:59.85]What did they even do?
[41:00.79]Alright, this is new content.
[41:04.61]This is new content.
[41:10.28]Ah!
[41:12.46]Okay.
[41:17.77]Why was I in a dog catcher van?
[41:28.42]This is new.
[41:29.88]I hope they don't- Are they gonna kill the fuck out of me, Arthur?
[41:34.06]Where is it?
[41:38.50]No, that's the scary guy that looked at me at the auction.
[41:40.57]Oh, I'm gonna get, like, tortured in this room.
[41:46.47]Is that Mr. Wu?
[41:46.85]We didn't get to see him last time.
[41:49.99]You can tell he's, like, the main bad guy because he's in a fucking bathrobe.
[42:09.06]I told you.
[42:10.14]I told you.
[42:12.42]Yep, the main guy is like the guy in the bathrobe.
[42:22.40]Oh, God.
[42:22.60]Oh, ow!
[42:24.15]Ooh!
[42:37.96]Oh, you made me bite my tongue!
[42:40.10]Where is the ball you took from the auction?
[42:43.14]Not the copy you brought to the police.
[42:45.48]I'm not gonna be able to leap yet.
[42:46.82]The original ball that you stole.
[42:48.83]Where?
[42:49.73]You've got the wrong guy.
[42:54.15]Oh, here he comes.
[42:56.17]Here comes, like, the tooth extractor.
[42:58.75]What the fuck is that?
[43:01.29]We know where the ball is.
[43:02.41]Oh, man.
[43:03.41]You and your lady friend.
[43:05.32]Next door.
[43:07.91]I can't wait till I get my teeth extracted.
[43:15.34]Yeah.
[43:15.46]Hold him down.
[43:15.84]Let's see his hand.
[43:17.88]Put it in the fist crusher.
[43:33.17]Mathematics.
[43:33.69]I know that.
[43:34.83]I know that.
[43:35.15]I won't be able to drive a car after this.
[43:36.25]Give me a chance to talk!
[44:00.70]Oh, I'm telling the truth immediately.
[44:03.87]Yeah, just tell them everything.
[44:05.33]Yeah, just... I'm throwing her under the bus.
[44:08.73]This is the good ending stream.
[44:11.17]Choose punishment.
[44:26.95]Choose punishment.
[44:28.48]Oh god, Etalyx.
[44:29.44]Etalyx.
[44:30.86]What?
[44:31.12]The long one or the short one?
[44:31.92]The long one or the short one?
[44:33.00]Long one.
[44:33.54]Long one, yep.
[44:34.00]The long one.
[44:34.88]Yep.
[44:35.38]Good idea.
[44:35.82]It's definitely like a little tiny penis thing in there.
[44:37.98]It's gonna be a little one.
[44:41.20]Watch this.
[44:41.75]He's gonna open that.
[44:42.31]It's gonna be nothing.
[44:44.35]It's gonna be like a little... Ah, it's actually huge.
[44:48.13]It's actually huge.
[44:50.97]Death comes slowly over a long, long time.
[45:00.77]Okay, the other one's probably poisoned.
[45:08.85]Yeah.
[45:10.57]What is she gonna say?
[45:11.31]Wait, what?
[45:12.92]I don't understand.
[45:16.74]What does she have to do?
[45:18.22]I'm saving myself.
[45:20.98]This is the good guy stream.
[45:22.46]We're getting the good ending here.
[45:24.60]I wish.
[45:31.29]Where is it?
[45:33.45]I can't tell you.
[45:34.82]I have to go get it for you.
[45:37.66]She's coming.
[45:38.42]How dare you.
[45:40.80]This is the good guy ending.
[45:43.68]I need to be the good guy and tell the truth.
[45:47.91]Okay, yep.
[45:48.51]He liked that.
[45:49.21]You can tell.
[45:57.95]You bring us the bowl.
[45:59.81]And she'll be punished.
[46:00.75]Good doesn't usually involve sacrificing main characters.
[46:05.04]Oh god, she has to go- Oh god, what have I done?
[46:10.72]Hey, remember, she's the one that lied and she's gonna get stabbed.
[46:14.08]This is supposed to be the good ending.
[46:17.42]This is supposed to be the good guy- I gotta be a good guy!
[46:19.08]You know, it should be her.
[46:21.99]She should get it.
[46:23.24]Keep me instead.
[46:24.28]It's decided.
[46:25.70]Oh, God.
[46:26.54]You bring us the ball.
[46:28.16]If you fail... No, this is supposed to be the good ending.
[46:31.36]You should do this.
[46:32.92]Okay, good, good.
[46:33.58]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[46:38.95]Just can't fail the mission, that's all.
[46:42.81]He just shoots me.
[46:43.61]That would have been so funny.
[46:47.68]Sorry, I uh, sorry I told them.
[46:49.83]Told them you fucked up every- I gotta go.
[46:51.35]It's the old guy.
[46:51.87]He's the one who fucked us.
[46:54.13]He fucked us all.
[46:56.15]How do you know that?
[46:58.65]Because I'm the one who forged the copy for him.
[47:01.56]What a reveal.
[47:03.08]Fuck me.
[47:03.94]Enough.
[47:05.40]Time to go.
[47:07.28]I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
[47:09.34]I'm sorry.
[47:10.64]Where's the original?
[47:13.08]I don't know.
[47:14.57]The guy behind you has got really good trigger discipline.
[47:17.02]Yeah, he does.
[47:22.06]That was very, very lame.
[47:24.86]I, like, fell off a little.
[47:26.72]Alright.
[47:30.97]You guys, I hope you guys are ready for this.
[47:32.37]The Etalyx was just really loud.
[47:36.81]I even turned him down.
[47:37.89]What happened?
[47:38.83]Okay.
[47:42.83]Is this Mystery Science Theater time?
[47:47.85]No.
[47:49.77]No, this is like, giggle incoherently at random things.
[47:54.07]I already did the MST3K thing last stream.
[47:57.71]Like, I already made all those jokes.
[48:04.20]So do you like this path better or the other one?
[48:07.36]Uh, the other one was better.
[48:11.40]What about the drunk guys that I fought for no reason?
[48:14.42]Actually, that one was better.
[48:15.48]Because I got to do that.
[48:18.57]No, it's going to happen again.
[48:21.35]Should I fight these guys?
[48:22.29]Or what?
[48:22.55]I don't even know what I'm walking away from.
[48:27.35]The drunk guys get in a fight.
[48:34.47]Should I beat these guys up again?
[48:44.80]It's okay.
[48:45.50]Sorry, he's just a little drunk.
[48:48.30]He's going to be like an older brother.
[48:49.42]Yep, see?
[48:49.64]Yeah, we're just having a little laugh.
[48:50.60]That's fine.
[48:50.94]Don't touch my face.
[49:12.87]I still don't understand what the difference is there.
[49:18.35]Did they just film that because they had extra time to put an extra scene in?
[49:24.29]Why are the police playing that music?
[49:26.11]Why were the police blasting that music?
[49:28.39]Who the fuck are these people?
[49:42.88]Why do I have all these people in my phone?
[49:46.48]Am I texting this guy?
[49:50.83]Who the fuck am I calling right now?
[49:52.31]I feel like I'm watching Memento right now.
[50:00.63]Dude, the choice.
[50:05.37]I'm really sorry to call this late.
[50:07.89]Is Sebastian at home?
[50:09.47]Who's speaking, please?
[50:11.17]It's, um, it's Dan from work.
[50:13.03]You always say Dan from work.
[50:14.43]I heard he was in an accident.
[50:16.69]Is he alive?
[50:17.81]Is he at home?
[50:18.47]No, no, he's not well.
[50:20.12]He's been taken to the hospital.
[50:21.48]He has a serious concussion.
[50:23.48]Wait, is this the bellboy?
[50:24.50]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[50:25.78]Or is this the... Where did they take him?
[50:27.18]This is the bellboy.
[50:27.76]They took him to St.
[50:28.86]Thomas's, but they won't let me visit until the morning.
[50:32.14]St.
[50:32.32]Thomas's, thank you.
[50:35.69]Okay.
[50:44.78]So that's the bellboy.
[50:46.74]Okay.
[50:47.16]So what we're going to do is we're going to hold a pillow over the bag boy's face, right?
[50:57.25]So I'm in the hospital now.
[50:58.31]Yeah, I've gone in a completely different direction.

[51:38.92]No, she owes me a favor.
[51:39.70]Good.
[51:40.34]What brings you here?
[51:42.76]I'm here to see someone.
[51:44.44]Can you tell me what room Sebastian the Clark's in, please?
[51:47.34]What room is he in?
[51:52.46]Is he here?
[51:55.49]I'm sorry.
[51:56.01]I can't help you.
[51:57.05]No, you owe me a favor.
[51:57.97]That's not how this works.
[51:58.85]It's just a room number.
[52:00.25]What?
[52:00.83]Like it was just a key.
[52:02.09]Oh, come on.
[52:02.95]I'll give her the $200 back.
[52:06.64]You want the $200 back?
[52:10.20]Look, this isn't about some entry ticket to some party, yeah?
[52:14.18]This is way bigger.
[52:16.04]What's so important that you need to see him now?
[52:21.60]Like?
[52:22.24]He's my cousin.
[52:23.08]Cousin.
[52:23.94]He's French.

[52:34.19]Fine.
[52:35.47]Good night.
[52:43.37]What?
[52:44.87]Wait, wait, I just walked over to the other receptionist.
[52:49.70]How is she, the girl sitting right there, not saying to not do that?
[53:02.62]There was an opportunity, there was like three opportunities, but she couldn't hear our conversation?
[53:09.69]Okay.
[53:11.21]The camera, she wasn't in frame, so therefore she can't hear what's going on.
[53:17.37]That's how movies work.
[53:20.80]Okay.
[53:22.22]What room is he in?
[53:23.02]I don't know.
[53:23.30]Do I have to start knocking on doors?
[53:27.70]No, this is a Hitman game.
[53:29.22]I would throw a rock over into the other room where she was so she gets distracted.
[53:35.36]That's not the guy.
[53:39.28]This is not the guy that I, like, strangled, is it?
[53:46.12]One of these guys... This is the guy that got syringed, right?
[53:50.46]What did I just do?
[53:51.16]Did I just, like, put... Oh.
[53:58.42]D-Baba.
[54:09.64]Uh... Okay.
[54:14.88]There he is.
[54:15.26]703.
[54:21.07]703.
[54:21.19]Let me, like, fold this guy up in the bed.
[54:25.39]Oh, God.
[54:25.81]This is gonna be fucking stupid.
[54:28.67]I have to, like, fucking fold this guy up and, like, do, like, a Muppets take Manhattan on him.
[54:36.41]I gotta Muppets take Manhattan this guy.
[54:44.99]This poor guy.
[54:45.69]I swear to the bits.
[55:11.82]Followed him up in the bed.
[55:19.01]Tell me about your deal with Samuel Parr.
[55:21.27]I know you replaced the Paulston Raspo with a forgery.
[55:24.47]That's a lie.
[55:30.81]Where's the rice bowl?
[55:32.79]It's stolen.
[55:33.49]Look at me.
[55:33.97]I was beaten up.
[55:36.67]Oh, God.
[55:39.37]Where is it?
[55:40.51]Where'd you put the original?
[55:41.51]Oh, God.
[55:42.17]I didn't put it anywhere.
[55:43.81]I know you switched it, Sebastian.
[55:49.99]Where is it?
[55:50.31]Fold him up.
[55:51.31]Fold him up in the bed.
[55:52.15]I didn't take it.
[55:54.75]This is a definite line.
[55:57.34]Oh, God!
[55:58.36]What a straggler!
[56:00.55]We're going for the good ending.
[56:02.21]We're going for the good ending.
[56:04.59]I need to know this information.
[56:05.63]We gotta go for the good ending.
[56:08.01]Told you.
[56:10.41]Where?
[56:15.07]I swapped it.
[56:17.47]In the elevator, I swapped the original with the forgery, and I hid it.
[56:22.28]The cabinet.
[56:23.83]Got what I needed.
[56:24.42]Peaceful.
[56:24.90]I am being a good guy.
[56:25.60]This is a bad guy.
[56:26.38]This is a bad guy.
[56:27.22]This is a fucking bad guy, guys.
[56:29.52]Just because he's in the hospital doesn't mean he's like a bad guy.
[56:33.48]He's not a bad guy.
[56:51.27]That's his heart rate not gone up.
[56:54.43]Yeah, his heart rate is exactly the same.
[56:55.83]He's calm as a cucumber.
[56:57.93]His heart rate.
[56:58.33]Auction house.
[56:58.99]We went to Parasauce last time and I died.
[57:00.99]Oh, pain killers.
[57:02.73]Thank Christ.
[57:20.55]What the fuck am I doing?
[57:22.39]Why am I taking drugs?
[57:23.77]Okay, now, where's my fold him up?
[57:30.32]Where's my press the button so it goes... Can't trust that.
[57:34.70]I can't trust this.
[57:35.40]This guy's gotta go.
[57:36.10]Get well soon.
[57:36.66]What did you say?
[57:54.73]Alright.
[57:56.31]Going to the auction house.
[58:06.43]What a nice guy.
[58:07.33]Alright.
[58:08.37]We're at the end, guys.
[58:09.78]We're about to get to the good ending here.
[58:26.04]It's a question of whether or not... What is the good ending?
[58:28.82]I don't know.
[58:29.76]I mean, like, what would you think it would be?
[58:32.28]You know what?
[58:32.90]I have no idea what the good ending would be.
[58:35.69]I don't know.
[58:36.77]What is the good ending?
[58:39.29]You, like, get the real ball back and...
[58:42.88]Probably like, you find the bowl, you give it up, but you save yourself and the girl.
[58:48.76]Yeah, but I don't have any motive here.
[58:50.41]I was kidnapped to do this.
[58:52.49]The girl is not even in this movie anymore.
[58:54.55]No, the girl's not in the movie anymore.
[58:56.03]Sneak to the elevator.
[59:07.72]This is like Hitman.
[59:08.38]They're not going to pay attention.
[59:09.20]I'm like dressed in the right clothing, right?
[59:11.84]Yep.
[59:12.34]She didn't even notice.
[59:15.76]Just like Hitman.
[59:16.80]You just got to walk by people.
[59:19.98]See, she had like a little yellow indicator over her head for a second and then like right when I got in the elevator it went down.
[59:24.50]Let's swipe the card.
[59:31.00]They canceled the card.
[59:35.27]We're going up.
[59:44.41]Interesting.
[59:46.63]Didn't he tell the police?
[59:47.61]Yeah, he did.
[59:48.91]Can you just take the stairs?
[59:50.77]I don't know, but what am I doing?
[59:52.19]I look so guilty.
[59:53.97]I'm just staring at everybody.
[59:54.93]Okay.
[60:03.45]We're in somebody's office.
[60:10.52]Computer.
[60:10.86]It's going to have some detail.

[61:12.76]How the hell am I gonna find van 7 from out here?
[61:15.48]They can tell you don't work there because you're the only one that doesn't have a name tag on.
[61:19.27]I know, but I just like walked out of the place.
[61:23.11]What?
[61:26.27]Wasn't I- Oh, there's one of the crash vans.
[61:41.74]What am I doing?
[61:42.54]I'm getting in this car?
[61:46.22]Okay, it was that easy.
[61:48.39]You're just going to sprint into somebody's backseat.
[61:56.59]Wait a minute, what if it's in here?
[62:02.32]Oh my god, it's going to be in here.
[62:03.60]I hope it's in here.
[62:04.50]And I'm just going to FBI roll out of here.
[62:11.57]It's definitely in one of these boxes.
[62:14.07]And then I get the good ending, I win.
[62:16.94]Open up, like, the 17th century, like, jewel box and find it.
[62:20.26]It's in there.
[62:24.44]Yep.
[62:25.92]Ladies and gentlemen, there it is.
[62:27.98]The real rice bowl.
[62:32.34]There it is.
[62:32.96]Secret compartment.
[62:33.70]Remember?
[62:34.76]Got it.
[62:37.86]Got it.

[62:44.68]Yeah, you could.
[62:49.96]Still got the bubble wrap and everything.
[62:51.38]Mei Ling?
[62:51.66]Mei Ling?

[62:53.83]I never met you before tonight.
[62:55.93]I got what I needed.
[62:56.53]I don't need to have her complicate this.
[63:01.11]Just fucking button her.

[63:08.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:09.01]That wasn't just her calling me.
[63:11.03]Wasn't she, like, kidnapped?
[63:12.83]Yeah, she was kidnapped.
[63:15.21]You finding the thing affects whether she lives or dies.
[63:18.38]Hold on a second.
[63:19.14]What the fuck is this?
[63:19.84]To be honest, I think this is more interesting.
[63:22.20]Should I call her?
[63:23.14]Should I call her?
[63:23.60]Should I call her?
[63:24.46]Cut and run.
[63:26.08]Fuck it.
[63:27.04]This thing's worth ten million.
[63:28.92]I'll go back there.
[63:29.62]I'm gonna get killed.
[63:31.15]And I don't owe anything to anyone, right?
[63:34.04]Get... I'm going home.
[63:36.42]I'm going home.
[63:38.05]I'm going home.
[63:38.57]No dude, I'm cutting and running.
[63:40.31]I'm going home.
[63:42.45]No they're not.
[63:43.27]I'm fine.
[63:43.65]No they're not.
[63:44.17]That's not gonna happen.
[63:46.53]Everything's gonna be fine.
[64:04.25]I forgot that she was... You're gonna get bad ending too now.
[64:06.63]No, I'm not gonna get bad ending too.
[64:07.95]I'm fine.
[64:08.85]Nobody knew where I lived.
[64:10.03]I have a $10 million piece of jewelry.
[64:12.67]I got a $10 million rice bowl.
[64:15.67]I got a good ending.
[64:16.37]See, I'm at my house.
[64:18.25]I made it to the house.
[64:20.44]Everything's good.
[64:21.10]You ran out of the van.
[64:22.36]Someone saw you get out of the van and you casually walked home from that point on.
[64:27.02]Dude, I think I did it.
[64:28.56]I'm pretty sure I beat the game.
[64:33.18]I'm just like, I got, I think I got the good ending.
[64:36.96]Like I got what I needed.
[64:38.82]I got away from the kidnappers.
[64:41.42]I got the $10 million thing.
[64:44.45]And now I'm just back at my house and I can just fucking play iPad games.
[64:47.33]We got it.
[65:01.60]Let's just, let's just, let's just hold on a minute.
[65:04.45]Let's just, uh... Did you quit in time?
[65:09.03]Hold on a minute.
[65:10.21]We just have to, uh, we gotta rethink a few options here.
[65:21.17]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[65:24.83]Now I'm gonna answer the phone.
[65:27.41]Answer the phone call.
[65:28.67]Make sure we get that correct.
[65:35.94]Honestly, I think that should have been a good ending instead of getting arrested.
[65:39.08]Getting arrested and seeing like you're dead?
[65:40.44]I get tired of choose-your-own-adventure games where the actual white knight hero option is the only good one.
[65:47.27]Yeah.
[65:49.17]This is so far back.
[65:51.61]No, it's not.
[65:54.07]Wait, how far back is this?
[65:58.27]Oh, shit!
[65:59.99]This is really far back.
[66:03.91]Or at least I know where to go.
[66:06.07]We're just going down.
[66:08.27]We'll talk to the receptionist first.
[66:10.55]Mr. Quinn is in room 13.
[66:13.05]Mr. Quinn is in 13.
[66:13.51]Sorry, sir.
[66:18.00]I'll be with you in a moment.
[66:19.40]No rush.
[66:19.80]Okay.
[66:25.48]Long flight.
[66:26.74]How can I help you?
[66:30.02]I'm here to pick up an item.
[66:31.55]What lot was it?
[66:32.53]It was an item bought last night by Mr. Samuel Parr.
[66:37.24]Okay.
[66:40.32]No.
[66:41.46]No, it's not... That's okay.
[66:42.32]Just pretend you didn't see me.
[66:43.16]I'm going to sneak by you.
[66:44.76]Yes, I have documentation.
[66:45.76]You're telling me you don't?
[66:46.94]I don't seem to.
[66:48.62]Oh, God.
[66:49.10]I could get the documentation halfway across the world to me, but I couldn't get them downstairs to you.
[66:54.04]For goodness sake.
[66:55.10]Pull up the fake... Let me take another look.
[66:56.32]Yeah, go.
[66:58.48]No, I had my chance to go.
[67:03.63]Here we are.
[67:04.49]I do apologize.
[67:06.69]Oh, it's scheduled for dispatch, not collection.
[67:10.15]Oh, fucking hell.
[67:12.63]Perhaps you should talk to Mr. Quinn about it.
[67:15.07]Yes, I would very much like to speak to Mr. Quinn about this.
[67:18.48]First floor?
[67:19.26]Second.
[67:19.98]Second floor, room 13.
[67:21.24]Okay.
[67:22.66]Yeah.
[67:24.22]That's fine.
[67:24.64]We're just going to go down.
[67:29.64]I already know what to do.
[67:30.40]I go down.
[67:36.79]Go to the ground level.
[67:38.89]And get in the back of the car.
[67:41.77]I can't go this way.
[67:43.03]The keycard don't work.
[67:46.15]Uh... No, not going up.
[67:48.09]Just have her swipe her card and go down.
[67:51.33]Why wouldn't I just say I'm going down?
[67:52.54]Can you, like, help me?
[67:53.46]No, I gotta do this shit again.
[67:59.86]Well... Okay.
[68:04.94]I gotta browse Reddit first.
[68:10.48]Is my memory this bad?
[68:11.50]No, I just, like, I wanted... I wanted to skip all this shit and just go down.
[68:16.86]I had to... After this, I go down into the elevator.
[68:19.22]I just want to go down.
[68:21.02]What the hell do you think you're doing?
[68:26.58]Your colleague let me in.

[68:33.46]Wait here.
[68:35.68]Wait here.
[68:37.38]Your character doesn't know.
[68:40.99]I can just do this, nothing happens, and just go down.

[69:20.24]I don't want to go to the garage.
[69:24.10]Who knows?
[69:24.66]Somebody might put a gun on me.
[69:25.74]I'm going to do what I know happens.

[78:12.64]Hey, thank you Diabeetles for your $15.
[78:14.94]This is like watching a movie with your friend who talks the whole time and gets mad when he doesn't understand what's going on.
[78:20.01]To be fair, we've watched the same movie like four times now.
[78:25.95]And why did that not show up in CLR browser?
[78:28.53]Don't ask me why.
[78:30.15]Answer in the van?
[78:31.27]How the hell am I gonna find van 7 from out here?
[78:36.74]Wait, I'm gonna get armed policed every time because I went to the police in the beginning.
[78:43.73]What it's actually like is when you're watching a movie with your friend, and your friend gets up to go to the bathroom and doesn't tell you to pause the movie, so you just let it keep going.
[78:52.48]Then when he gets back, he asks you what happened.
[78:54.44]And then you rewind the movie, you watch it again, but every time you get to the same place, he has to pee again.
[79:03.98]Wait, don't answer in van.
[79:06.94]You'll be forced to die.
[79:09.48]What?
[79:10.44]I'm not going to answer in the van, because he'll hear me and he'll fuck it up.
[79:20.26]Don't forget to high-five.
[79:24.74]We're gonna get it this time.
[79:25.56]I can't wait for this guy to tell me I'm a fucking asshole again, that's gonna be great.
[79:37.67]I go to pars and I get the confession, right?
[79:39.85]I gotta get him recorded saying like, I did it, it was me all along, right?

[80:56.51]I didn't kill you.
[80:57.47]The last time I came, I went to go try to, like, rescue her with the bowl.
[81:00.45]And it was over.
[81:03.11]She says, we have to prove it.
[81:04.23]And I'm like, okay, so let's go prove it.

[82:41.38]What the hell are you talking about?
[82:42.74]Pee-wee Herman, that's right.
[82:43.64]What I was taking from Hainsworth tonight was a real one.
[82:46.51]Audrey never left that compartment.
[82:48.67]Where is it?
[82:49.87]Okay.
[82:51.13]The gun is in the safe.
[82:53.29]Where is it?
[82:57.20]Time travelers.
[82:58.62]Don't let him go to the safe.
[82:59.78]The gun is in the safe.
[83:00.74]Yep.
[83:01.34]I know the gun's in the safe.
[83:02.46]Keep him out of the safe.
[83:08.40]What?
[83:11.12]Don't give it to him.
[83:14.12]Why would I give it to him?
[83:15.01]Like, toss the ball to him?
[83:16.13]Are you fucking serious?
[83:18.37]No.
[83:19.09]Take a look.

[83:31.65]What the fuck is... What?
[83:32.36]How did you find out?
[83:34.40]I think Mayling can recognize her own work when she sees it.
[83:37.16]You paid her to do it.
[83:39.22]So she won't mind me destroying it.

[90:43.59]This is just adding extra scenes.
[90:46.11]That's all this did.
[90:46.88]You just gotta be patient.
[90:48.82]Etalyx just added two extra scenes.
[90:51.10]We're seeing extra new content, okay?
[90:54.47]New concept.
[90:55.31]It's just taking us longer to get to where we want to go.
[90:59.41]Okay.
[90:59.81]Alright.
[91:02.99]Am I answering the phone in the van?
[91:07.07]We're not there yet.
[91:08.09]We're going to be there very soon.
[91:12.84]Do I answer the phone in the van?
[91:15.80]Hang on.
[91:16.74]What do you mean, hang on?
[91:17.94]I got to figure it out.
[91:20.74]I don't have all the answers.
[91:22.38]I'm learning as we go.
[91:26.28]If I answer the phone.
[91:28.52]I think you answered the phone.
[91:29.88]Answer the phone.
[91:30.32]You want me to answer the phone?
[91:31.80]I believe you answered the phone.
[91:33.01]Oh, God.
[91:33.51]Everyone in chat is freaking out about this.
[91:34.87]They're saying no.
[91:37.93]Hey, this is my run.
[91:38.99]Oh, God.
[91:39.43]No, but I'm not doing this again.
[91:40.65]Whatever happens, it's over.
[91:44.65]I'm not doing a fifth time travel.
[91:46.94]Answer the phone.
[91:47.94]Answer the phone.
[91:48.98]Answer the phone.
[91:50.98]Are you sure about this?
[91:52.23]Yeah.
[91:53.43]Metallics is cheating.
[91:54.33]Well, we've done this five times, Chad.
[91:56.87]It's not cheating at this point.
[91:58.29]Okay, I'm gonna answer the phone.
[92:00.19]This better not be the police answering.
[92:03.07]I believe it's just the same conversation you would have later.
[92:06.71]Wait.
[92:08.39]I don't have much time.
[92:10.69]Have you got the ball?
[92:11.27]Yeah.
[92:11.37]I've got it in my hands.
[92:11.87]Don't breathe.
[92:14.81]Oh, it is the same thing.
[92:16.73]It's just skipped.
[92:18.23]It's just you do it sooner.
[92:19.49]See, we're doing less content.
[92:22.03]And you are gonna go back to pars.
[92:23.45]Okay.
[92:24.35]So it's just, it just deletes one scene.
[92:28.08]Fuck.
[92:29.04]Oh my god.
[92:29.84]That's so funny that it just... You've been avoiding it for this long.
[92:36.04]Mm-hmm.
[92:37.10]Go to pars.
[92:39.06]Go to pars.
[92:39.50]That's so funny.
[92:40.46]It literally just removes the next scene, and that's it.
[92:43.44]Same conversation.
[92:46.91]I can't leave her to die.
[92:48.41]How could I live with that?
[92:49.17]Alright.
[92:50.15]I just need some kind of plan.
[92:52.50]Everybody was freaking out.
[92:53.50]I thought it was gonna be bad because I was gonna answer it and this guy was gonna hear me.
[92:55.92]Alright, so I get the pars.
[93:00.01]I'll tell you when I'm there.
[93:02.35]We're going for the good ending.
[93:05.48]Okay, Etalyx, you've read the spoilers.
[93:07.58]Do I get to hit this guy with a golf club?
[93:09.00]Not yet.
[93:09.22]I'm kind of learning as you learned, actually.
[93:11.52]No, not you, mate.
[93:13.26]I don't have all the answers yet.
[93:16.10]I don't know what's going to happen.
[93:17.98]I hope I still get to hurt this guy with a golf club.
[93:20.06]I don't want to shoot him.
[93:20.81]Maybe I do.
[93:21.79]No.
[93:26.55]Okay, here we go.
[93:28.75]Why was this different?
[93:34.55]Good morning.
[93:34.97]I have an appointment with Samuel Parr.
[93:37.24]Mr. Parr does not receive guests before 10 o'clock.
[93:39.36]Okay, well, this is... I don't want to see me.
[93:40.66]I don't want to see me right now.
[93:43.32]Wait here.
[93:46.84]Wait, you can't... What?
[93:48.64]Mr. Parr!
[93:49.82]Thank you, hello.
[93:51.03]Okay.
[93:51.91]I'll deal with this.
[93:52.97]Alright, alright.
[93:53.69]Here he comes.
[93:54.09]Alright, this is just... We're back where we were.
[94:00.41]Who are you?
[94:06.38]I'm here to tell you that unfortunately Mr. Leclerc failed to carry out his task.
[94:10.10]What the hell are you talking about?
[94:11.64]The bottle that was taken from Hainsworth tonight was a real one.
[94:17.62]Where is it?
[94:18.40]Alright, you gotta place it on the table again.
[94:22.71]I'm sorry, chat.
[94:23.57]Place it on the table?
[94:24.55]Yep, you gotta put it on the table.
[94:26.61]You want me to place this on the table?
[94:27.85]Are you fucking shitting me?
[94:29.17]Vitalik, are you sure about this?
[94:34.67]Place it on the table.
[94:36.19]I'm just doing what I- Place it on the table!
[94:38.91]I did it.
[94:41.83]I hope you're right.
[94:44.77]You- Did you know?
[94:45.71]You didn't just fuck this up again, did you?
[94:47.78]I don't think so.
[94:48.76]What do I do next?
[94:49.46]There's no other option!
[94:52.78]Hold on.
[94:53.48]You just place it on the table.
[94:54.48]I'm about to figure out what you do next.
[94:56.32]This is the coffee.
[94:59.21]If this ends up being the same thing we've already seen, I'm going to be mad.
[95:01.91]Oh, Etalyx, please don't tell her you fucked this up.
[95:03.99]You have to let him drop it.
[95:04.85]He has to drop it.
[95:06.71]You have to let him drop it.
[95:07.91]Yeah.
[95:08.09]So just let him drop it.
[95:28.31]Ooh, okay.
[95:30.59]That would be unwise, wouldn't it?
[95:32.33]Okay.
[95:32.77]Not with the joys on the rampage.
[95:35.19]We're in uncharted territory now.
[95:37.02]Now where is my original?
[95:39.36]Where's the original?
[95:41.16]What does she want?
[95:41.84]What did I?
[95:45.72]Oscar.
[95:47.92]God.
[95:51.94]Here we go.
[95:52.52]Come on.
[95:52.76]Mr. Parr.
[95:54.54]Clever little girl, aren't you?
[95:55.73]Got it.
[95:56.45]Not just a pretty face.
[95:59.18]How much?
[96:04.33]4.5 million?
[96:06.47]I'd consider keeping the copy for that.
[96:10.29]You fucking little bitch.
[96:11.41]What car crash?
[96:12.09]The one from the bridge.
[96:12.77]He ran you off the road.
[96:13.85]When did they reveal that?
[96:15.49]Just now.
[96:29.92]Okay, here we go.
[96:32.64]It's done.
[96:33.56]It's done.
[96:33.90]It's done.
[96:34.76]Now get me my original.
[96:36.94]Okay.
[96:37.74]My friend is going to fetch it for you right now.
[96:39.70]Oh, God.
[96:40.00]Here we go.
[96:41.08]What the hell?
[96:42.30]Mikey knows.
[96:43.17]Are you outside the house?
[96:44.63]Don't let him in the safe.
[96:46.37]Right?
[96:51.61]Oh, shit.
[96:54.09]Oh, I just got tricked.
[96:57.23]Oh, boy.
[96:58.36]I'm in for it now.
[96:59.40]Good ending.
[96:59.84]We got the true ending.
[97:00.62]I think we're getting the good ending.
[97:05.42]We are getting a good end.
[97:07.50]Nice job, guys.
[97:09.12]We did it.
[97:26.07]Congratulations.
[97:26.93]Yeah, I may have looked up how to get the good in, but we've tried every other option, so was there really any other choices?
[97:33.62]Money and we're alive.
[97:35.00]That's true.
[97:36.96]Cool.
[97:38.62]Nice.
[97:38.86]Here we go.
[97:40.88]We did it.
[97:51.56]That was such an unsatisfying true ending.
[97:54.28]Like, that's it?
[97:55.36]That's it.
[97:56.74]That's it.
[97:57.80]Okay, good.
[98:01.44]Hold on, I... Make sure you stick around for the after credits scene.
[98:07.55]Fuck!
[98:08.49]Just kidding, there's not one.
[98:10.21]I was trying to, like, go back.
[98:12.19]There's not one.
[98:14.43]There's two more endings to unlock?
[98:16.07]I don't know what the fuck they even are.
[98:20.96]well there it is there it is now you've like beaten you got five out of seven yeah five out of seven endings can you imagine actually playing through the whole thing seven times though no instead of just going back to the last checkpoint to get the other ending that really is only like two and a half other ways to go so you only make decisions at the final location yeah so it's it's like
[98:45.42]And you choose which of the two side stories you want to pursue.
[98:48.08]Yeah.
[98:48.76]If you want to see Mr. Wu or the police, which Mr. Wu is way more interesting.
[98:52.76]Both of those side stories are 100% meaningless.
[98:56.33]Yeah.
[98:57.13]All they do is, like, slightly change the way that, like, people say things to you.
[99:01.19]But, I mean, that, you know, look, look.
[99:04.23]First experiences are everything.
[99:06.49]That's true, but, like, but, like, look.
[99:08.07]The first experience.
[99:08.91]This game was fucking 10 bucks.
[99:10.92]Yeah.
[99:11.84]It's not like this was, like, a $40 game or, like, a $30 game.
[99:16.20]This shit was $10.
[99:16.64]And you know what?
[99:18.88]I... I got just over two and a half hours of content.
[99:22.36]Like, of, like, usable... Like, oh, like, content, right?
[99:28.02]Like, there was, like, enough content in this game to justify, like, $10.
[99:32.86]It was worth it.
[99:33.70]It was fun.
[99:34.14]It was funny.
[99:36.36]If there wasn't, like, $10 worth of content, maybe not.
[99:41.10]So there you go.
[99:43.15]Late shift.
[99:45.01]Oh, my God.
[99:45.63]What a disaster.
[99:47.71]At least I'm glad we closed it out with this.
[99:50.73]But... Anywho.
[99:54.01]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[99:54.85]I was not anticipating trying to be a completionist on late shift tonight.
[100:00.25]But... Redeemed, I think.
[100:02.65]It was a fun stream halfway through there.
[100:07.07]Sorry, Etalyx, for you having to have you deal with all that shit in the first hour of the stream.
[100:13.25]That's okay.
[100:13.81]I'm just really glad that I didn't turn mine on.
[100:18.58]Really, I know.
[100:19.18]Jeez.
[100:20.38]Say goodbye to Etalyx, everybody.
[100:22.14]Thanks for sticking around.
[100:22.76]Good night, everyone.
[100:23.58]Always a pleasure.
[100:24.98]Yeah, it's been fun.
[100:26.36]Make sure you follow Etalyx.
[100:27.64]He's a streamer, too.
[100:29.92]Symbiotic, vicarious relationship that we have.
[100:34.46]And right at the end here, Dedo.
[100:35.95]Yeah, Dedo just gave $10.
[100:36.91]You're not my chat, but I like you anyway.
[100:41.79]Dedo just gave $10 and just cheered $1,000.
[100:44.09]So thank you for the $10.
[100:46.83]Thank you.
[100:48.56]And with that, guys, that's going to wrap it up here.
[100:50.40]Have a good night.
[100:50.78]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[100:53.94]And we will make something happen.
[100:55.58]So good night.
[100:56.32]Good luck.
[100:56.78]Goodbye.
[100:57.90]Have a good rest of your night.
[100:58.80]Bye-bye.
