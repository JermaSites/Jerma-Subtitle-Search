[05:34.05]This is a character creator.
[05:36.07]Keldor male.
[05:40.47]Maybe.
[05:41.55]Rodian male.
[05:45.46]Zabrak human.
[05:48.20]Should I just be a human?
[05:49.18]I feel like if you can't play a human, because that's just like making a human in World of Warcraft.
[06:01.66]Like, oh, I'm on my, like, eighth character.
[06:03.63]I guess it's gonna be another human.
[06:05.57]No, you don't want to make a human.
[06:08.51]Although, like, maybe I kind of do.
[06:16.58]I think I want to make a human.
[06:18.68]That's so boring, but whatever.
[06:20.20]Don't fucking do it.
[06:22.97]Oh my god.
[06:24.07]But, I don't know.
[06:31.44]Alright, I changed my mind.
[06:33.36]I think I want to be this guy.
[06:35.08]No, wait.
[06:37.40]This one.
[06:39.24]No, no, no, no.
[06:39.92]This one.
[06:42.79]Just be Greedo.
[06:45.81]I don't want to be Greedo.
[06:49.25]Okay, I think this one.
[06:51.79]Alright, so that's the head.
[06:52.79]Torso.
[06:56.47]Hmm.
[06:56.67]Hmm.
[07:02.65]I don't want to make any more World of Warcraft references, but this is all like starter gear.
[07:07.74]This is like level one tabard.
[07:09.44]I'd be level one tabard non-human Rodian male.
[07:19.31]I made my own guild.
[07:20.35]I haven't even gotten the 10 signatures yet, and I tried to make my own tabard.
[07:25.37]Tabard.
[07:25.89]Whatever.
[07:26.21]I'm going to make WoW jokes today, I guess.
[07:28.78]Relax.
[07:32.11]Relax, relax.
[07:33.27]Oh wow, you made a World of Warcraft joke again.
[07:39.11]It's just in the top of the mind.
[07:40.19]I don't know why.
[07:43.73]What color do I want?
[07:44.77]I like the gray.
[07:48.47]Yeah.
[07:49.43]Alright, looks good.
[07:53.88]That looks good too.
[07:59.34]What do you think?
[08:00.42]This?
[08:00.54]I like those boots.
[08:01.89]This is a good setup.
[08:02.49]Alright, yeah.
[08:05.79]This is fine.
[08:08.97]Oh, shit.
[08:09.73]Okay, hold on.
[08:10.35]This is incredibly important.
[08:14.80]What?
[08:20.42]There's only one lightsaber?
[08:25.28]Oh, man.
[08:26.02]Hold on.
[08:29.61]Which one of these do I want?
[08:30.85]Alright, I kind of want the kazoo.
[08:36.58]Yeah, this thing you go and you can put it in your mouth and be like... It's a blunt.
[08:46.96]No.
[08:50.43]Just don't hold it the wrong way.
[08:53.62]You press the wrong button.
[08:54.52]You don't press, like, the kazoo button.
[08:57.38]It just goes right through the back of your head.
[08:59.82]Um... What do I... I don't want to be, like, the Luke Skywalker look.
[09:03.94]I'm not going to do this.
[09:06.94]Maybe I am.
[09:09.78]Orange is kind of cool.
[09:11.04]Although, I would probably have, like... It would probably be yellow.
[09:14.30]Or white.
[09:16.60]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:17.40]Of course it wouldn't.
[09:19.74]I would have the dark saber.
[09:22.59]It's only one.
[09:25.41]And it's mine.
[09:26.27]I would use it.
[09:27.26]That would be my blade.
[09:28.90]I think I'm going to... Purple's cool.
[09:48.93]While you were out partying, I studied.
[09:52.18]what alright no okay well how about we do the one that's on the shelf at every like target this one I like it I think I might want yellow too if I alright medium combat style medium I can't I can't change that alright I cannot change the combat style I just have a medium saber

[10:42.95]You can't DM CA this stream because it's in a video game, not a real fucking movie.
[10:53.09]You can't.
[10:54.41]I've read all kinds of threads about how this works and this is allowed.
[11:01.70]Uh, is it?
[11:08.39]Ten years after the Battle of Endor, the Imperial remnant continues to be driven back by the New Republic, forcing the Imperials to adopt increasingly desperate tactics in the ongoing struggle.
[11:20.52]Meanwhile, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker moves to restore the Jedi to their formal place as peacekeepers of the galaxy at his Jedi Academy on Yavin 4.
[11:36.04]face jaden core a promising student from crusade is en route to the academy after achieving the impossible creating a lightsaber without any formal jedi training so he's a fraud and he's being brought to the capital for justice and prosecution
[12:05.12]Croissant?
[12:05.64]I don't know.
[12:06.10]I couldn't read it.
[12:14.42]Is that me?
[12:15.34]Is that Mark Hamill?
[12:16.70]It's Mark Hamill.
[12:18.72]It has to be.
[12:22.86]Wait, why is this like Harry Potter?
[12:26.90]Does this happen?
[12:28.06]Aren't you excited?
[12:29.24]We're going to be Jedi!
[12:30.82]Learning the ways of the Force, building a lightsaber?
[12:34.12]Of course, you already have one.
[12:36.22]I'm going to get one of those stupid training sabers and then- I wouldn't worry about that.
[12:39.70]Wait, what?
[12:40.02]I talk?
[12:40.88]I can't help it.
[12:42.26]I want to make a good impression.
[12:43.16]I'm not the silent protagonist?
[12:44.05]You seem really nervous.
[12:45.81]Aren't you?
[12:46.71]I mean, well, why would you be?
[12:48.85]You already have a lightsaber, so you're probably way ahead of me.
[12:52.59]I'm Rosh, by the way.
[12:55.05]I'm not supposed to have- I'm not supposed to have this?
[12:57.07]Why do I have this?

[12:58.71]Wait, what?
[12:59.73]That's the noise you make when you have a wedgie, not the fucking- plane is going down.

[14:22.81]Alright, let's go.
[14:28.33]I bet you wish you had one of these.
[14:29.91]I don't know how to use this though.
[14:37.27]Okay, let's go.
[14:42.09]Shouldn't I put the thing down?
[14:45.89]Maybe you can use your lightsaber to cut those trees down and make a bridge.
[14:49.07]Oh, maybe I could.
[14:49.65]Yeah, that'd be cool.
[14:53.02]Come on over here.
[14:55.88]Thanks, Jaden.

[15:09.47]I didn't know I could kill him.
[15:10.23]Do I have a blast?
[15:10.75]Maybe I shouldn't do anything.
[15:13.21]Put this thing away.
[15:14.61]Just flailing around.
[15:15.61]Like a kid on Christmas morning that just opened it up.
[15:46.04]Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[15:49.48]This way.
[15:51.70]Follow me.
[15:52.54]To the temple.
[15:56.94]Kill him again.
[15:57.64]I'm not going to kill him again.
[16:01.81]I can't.
[16:04.57]What's in there?
[16:05.23]Oh.
[16:07.05]Checkpoint.
[16:10.24]What's wrong with me?
[16:12.10]What's wrong with me?
[16:15.19]Yeah, I would stay the fuck away from this guy.
[16:18.35]Like stay at least like five car lengths away from me, man.
[16:21.71]I'm not going near this guy.
[16:22.75]What?
[16:35.13]Why can't I hit him?
[16:37.42]Pretty cool trick, huh?
[16:39.04]I learned that at the, didn't go to the academy yet.
[16:41.12]We haven't even stepped in there.
[16:43.33]Haven't done one class.
[16:45.79]I watched a few YouTube videos.
[16:47.65]What do you think?
[16:52.96]Self-taught Jedi from YouTube tutorials.
[16:56.54]Hey, dick.
[17:19.46]Why can you die from that?
[17:22.08]I'm such a shitty cadet.
[17:26.30]I don't know why I did that.
[17:35.21]Alright, just let him do the work.
[17:40.43]Oh, well, this is what happens, man.
[17:41.79]We're two cadets.
[17:42.53]We have no idea what we're doing.
[17:43.73]I just eBayed this lightsaber.
[17:49.59]I don't know what the hell I'm doing with it.
[17:52.54]Kill.
[17:52.96]Shoot it.
[17:56.44]You didn't have a chance.
[18:00.37]Like, I'm not cool.
[18:01.51]I'm not with it.
[18:02.45]I'm just a guy that bought this somehow.
[18:04.61]I, I, I, like, this was a fucking, like, $45,000 on eBay.
[18:09.22]And I thought it was fake, but I was like, you know what?
[18:10.60]I'm gonna go for it.
[18:11.18]And what if it's real?
[18:11.94]Well, at least it turned out it was real.
[18:14.10]What's that?
[18:27.02]It's just a murderer on the loose.
[18:29.68]Hey, maybe you can use your saber to make another bridge.
[18:32.82]Hey.
[18:35.32]What?
[18:35.56]Did he not make it?
[18:37.04]He didn't make the jump?
[18:39.98]I am so disappointed that he didn't make the jump.
[18:43.48]How did you not make the jump?
[18:44.86]What?
[18:45.08]Watch out.
[18:53.35]He jumped into the wall.
[18:54.37]How did you die?
[18:55.29]I don't understand.
[19:02.23]Jeremy, use quicksave.
[19:03.47]What button is it?
[19:08.35]Alright, don't kill him.
[19:09.25]Shoot him!
[19:15.86]Nice teamwork, man.
[19:19.74]Alright, make the jump.
[19:22.40]Um, did he die from fall damage?
[19:26.22]Oh my god.
[19:26.82]I'm so mad that I missed that.
[19:28.78]He must have died from fall damage.
[19:31.80]Let's go.
[19:32.18]I feel like I need to keep an eye on you in case you do something stupid.
[19:42.72]Alright, move.
[19:47.94]Alright, go in, wait till he's done.
[19:59.87]Holy shit, we suck.

[20:17.54]I finally sheathed the lightsaber.
[20:30.30]Alright, I'll check it out.

[30:29.35]This course will familiarize you with your core Force abilities.
[30:33.41]These are powers that every Force user has.
[30:36.53]As you progress in your training, you will learn new abilities.
[30:40.26]Both the light and dark sides will be open to you.
[30:43.74]Remember, abilities are not inherently good or evil.
[30:48.06]It's how you use them.
[30:50.08]Every Jedi is naturally stronger in different areas of the Force, and it will be up to you to decide what to focus on.
[30:57.20]Yep, dark side.
[30:58.06]I'm going to go fold.
[30:58.60]I want to shoot electricity at my hands.

[39:47.91]Matt?
[39:48.03]Do you know what's called a Matt?
[39:49.17]He just forgot his first name.
[39:50.55]Oh, sorry about that, Matt.

[41:42.37]The city of Coronet on Corellia has had numerous reports of activity by the disciples of Ragnos.
[41:48.23]However, it's not clear if it's really the Sith cult or if the locals are just being paranoid about after hearing about it on the Holonet.
[41:56.92]Go to Coronet and determine the truth.
[41:59.12]I still have a few contacts in Coronet.
[42:03.52]We'll hit a few of the local cantinas and see what crops up.

[59:09.64]No, you can't.
[59:11.14]So give me the fucking code to get to the main base.
[59:17.27]And I'll think about letting you out.
[59:20.49]Because you're not locked in here with me.
[59:22.87]I'm locked in here with you.
[59:26.76]No, no.

[60:47.61]I've cleared the room.
[60:48.59]I'm ready.
[60:51.62]Now I'm going to get rid of this shit and I'm going to throw a grenade in there.
[60:55.87]That's that one.

[61:27.49]Holy shit, this is what they were defending.
[61:30.75]Yeah, there's like the hops and the vats and stuff.
[61:32.99]This is like a beer factory.

[67:05.79]That wasn't even the Jedi.
[67:07.29]Oh, shit.

[68:53.29]It's right click, isn't it?
[68:58.19]You guys said right click.
[68:59.37]Is it proximity?
[69:04.62]Are you throwing on purpose?
[69:05.62]No, I thought it was detonations.
[69:09.70]The lightning zapped the bomb.
[69:10.96]I didn't do anything.
[69:12.22]I didn't press anything.
[69:13.63]The lightning hit it.
[69:15.35]Wait.

[79:38.55]Get me back into this.
[79:41.82]Come on!
[79:42.50]A lightning strike will probably fix it.
[79:47.86]Need to restart the game?
[79:48.82]Okay.
[80:04.36]Alright, I'm gonna restart.
[80:10.42]Restart the game?

[81:19.30]Maybe just air shot him.
[81:36.29]Can't dodge everything, man.
[81:38.39]Okay, now... Let's go up and hold fire.
[81:44.43]Does that work?
[81:45.41]Just get over here.
[82:03.76]Get over here.
[82:12.71]Watch out.
[82:13.01]This guy's got blasters right there.
[82:14.25]I got it.
[82:14.55]Did I win?
[82:16.73]Oh, okay.
[82:18.87]It's slow mode.
[82:19.38]That was weird.
[82:26.28]Come the fuck on, dude.
[82:38.31]Oh my god.
[82:43.58]oh my god oh my god
[83:14.67]How do you fucking miss?
[83:16.89]My god, worst Jedi ever.
[83:29.60]Get the fuck out of here.
[83:30.72]Alright, my goodness, can I get to the end?
[83:35.29]I made it.
[83:35.97]Thank god.
[83:38.45]I did it.
[83:41.18]Rage.
[83:41.48]Hit force heal, I'm fucking begging you.
[83:43.04]Alright, I will.
[83:44.16]I will.
[84:11.77]Darth Vader.
[84:14.15]It's definitely Darth Vader.
[84:18.03]How about mercenary activity?
[84:20.91]A number of reports that the disciples of Ragnos have been trying to hire mercenaries and smugglers to haul some cargo.
[84:35.11]If we can contact one of these mercenary groups, we can find out the cult's base of operations.
[84:40.75]One of the smuggling rings that we know about is based in Mos Eisley.
[84:44.19]Go there and see what you can find out.
[84:45.63]This one sounds like it could be nasty, so I'll be going with you.
[84:49.19]You'll find some of the galaxy's worst lowlifes on Tatooine.
[84:53.69]Uh, my parents are from Tatooine.
[84:56.09]And I've spent like 15-20 years there, growing up.
[85:01.37]Uh, thanks though.
[85:04.61]Alright, what do we got?
[85:05.17]Uh, Force Heal.
[85:11.23]Jedi have the ability to heal themselves after injury.
[85:15.13]Thank God.
[85:15.85]Okay.
[85:16.55]Jedi heal.
[85:17.41]What about weapons?
[85:23.01]I want to pick a different lightsaber.
[85:28.30]I'll try the electromagnetic blaster and I'll just take the regular blaster.
[85:32.38]Level 3 lightning is amazing though.
[85:37.26]Most force powers are totally useless until level 3.
[85:39.48]Oh.
[85:42.69]Alright.
[85:42.97]Dismember.
[85:46.52]Alright, I'm gonna do the... After this cutscene.

[85:50.70]Relax.
[85:50.96]Do we know them?
[85:52.34]Kyle does.
[86:13.64]I've got a bad feeling about this.
[86:16.46]Listen, stay here and guard the entrance to the docking bay.
[86:19.78]If anyone tries to enter or leave, detain them.
[86:22.77]I'll head over to the crate canteen and ask around.
[86:24.95]Don't let anybody leave.
[86:25.83]Don't let anybody get in.
[86:31.96]I won't let you down.
[86:33.58]Nobody leaves.
[86:34.30]Nobody gets in.
[86:49.87]Oh, hi.
[86:50.41]I need to kill you.
[86:52.49]Don't let anybody out.

[86:57.19]He has to die.
[86:57.93]I'm abandoning my post.
[86:58.49]I'm not supposed to be doing this.

[92:15.25]That doesn't matter.
[92:15.83]That is stupid.
[92:22.23]You need mods for it.
[92:23.31]Alright, yeah.
[92:23.97]You guys don't have any idea what's going on.
[92:33.89]Chat has no idea what's going on.
[92:46.22]You have to go to the config files.
[92:47.72]Yeah.
[92:47.96]Well, I'm not going to do that.
[92:49.32]I'm going to play the game.
[92:51.52]I'm not going to turn the game off, do the config, test it.
[92:54.11]Did it work?
[92:54.67]It didn't work.
[92:55.23]I have to go back into the yard.
[92:56.25]So it didn't work.
[92:56.93]Whoopsie daisy.
[92:57.49]You got to go back and do this and then fucking do that.
[93:07.71]You have to defrag the hard drive.
[93:11.51]So much false shit.
[93:16.59]How do I get out of here?
[93:21.47]Where do we go?
[93:22.03]Turn on the sex scenes.
[93:42.30]Where are we supposed to even go?
[93:43.62]I wasn't paying attention.
[93:44.38]I was too busy trying to turn on big head mode.
[93:48.17]They're in go-karts and their heads fly off when you hit them once.
[93:52.73]Watch out, Chewie.
[94:11.08]I'll do my best Han Solo Chewie for you guys.
[94:13.69]I'll do it as much as I can.
[94:14.71]I'm going to try really hard.
[94:22.25]There needs to be a scenario where I say it though.
[94:27.36]I don't know why I thought for one second I thought that was him talking.
[94:49.18]Chewie.
[94:50.56]That was bad.
[94:51.08]It was supposed to be... Didn't expect him to shoot yet.
[94:57.32]We need more cover.
[94:58.18]Let's get back to our ship.
[95:02.74]Chewie, Chewie, Chewie, Chewie.
[95:03.60]Don't go out there.
[95:04.44]Chewie, that's a bad idea.
[95:06.90]I'm going to snipe this person from like 100 miles away.
[95:10.28]Whoops.
[95:12.32]Whoops.
[95:13.08]I don't have it anymore.
[95:14.10]Where's it?
[95:15.49]Oh, come on.
[95:23.28]Who is it?
[95:29.26]Nice.
[95:29.58]Took his leg off.
[95:30.74]Look at that dismemberment.
[96:21.77]Joey!
[96:23.01]Torture him!
[96:30.51]What are you doing?
[96:33.00]Get him, Chewie!
[96:43.26]What happened?
[96:50.56]Oh my god.
[96:53.18]Conserve your health, please.
[96:55.65]Oh, shit.
[96:58.39]Chewie, that was a weird way to... What?
[97:00.85]Why did Chewie just go like... That's not how Chewie talks.
[97:04.75]What's Force Heal?
[97:12.05]Okay, controls.
[97:16.63]Drink Rage.
[97:17.85]Okay, Force Heal.
[97:19.47]Oh my god, that's so useful.
[97:30.61]I'm just gonna do it again.
[97:31.74]Like I don't care.
[97:37.68]Razor Death Adder Mouse 5.
[97:39.98]Yeah, don't buy this thing.
[97:44.14]Did you... What the hell happened?
[97:58.07]Watch out, Joey!
[97:59.71]What happened to the grenade?
[98:09.48]Okay, I'm sorry.
[98:14.22]Two voice Andy.
[98:15.70]Joey!
[98:16.82]Joey!
[98:17.66]Joey!
[98:19.08]Nice backflip.
[98:34.70]What do we do?
[98:36.34]Joey, what are we supposed to do?
[98:38.74]New offer.
[98:40.42]What do you got?
[98:40.88]Let me see it.
[98:46.63]Limited time offer.
[98:48.27]$4 off the debt.
[98:49.26]If you go and do all this shit in the autoexe folder.
[98:52.00]No.
[98:52.16]Honestly, I don't even care if that was like fucking a billion.
[98:55.72]I wouldn't do it.
[98:56.08]I don't even care.
[99:06.31]$4 million off the debt.
[99:07.69]No, that's not enough.
[99:09.81]He hates us.
[99:12.25]Alright, force press the buttons.
[99:21.54]Is there nothing actually in here?
[99:51.72]the middle of that I just saw somebody right good that's an evil droid it was walking around and it was it had a gun all the way deep into his head and it was going to come out and just go I don't know because I had the intel I know the exact model number and the exact serial code
[100:24.19]What?
[100:24.97]Why am I looking at cameras?
[100:25.93]Where the hell are we supposed to go?
[100:42.92]We have to go like up there?
[100:54.38]Put on the droid zoom.
[100:55.88]Just jump up here?
[100:56.60]I don't think Chewie can do this.
[101:00.38]Chewie's not a Jedi.
[101:03.86]It's kind of annoying that they didn't, um... They should have eventually.
[101:06.75]I don't know why they didn't give Chewie a lightsaber eventually.
[101:08.55]Or like a lightsaber gun.
[101:11.61]Like he shoots out, like, beams.
[101:13.11]Like lightsaber beams with, like, the crystals.
[101:15.85]He deserved it.
[101:16.35]These computers?
[101:22.59]I don't... What am I supposed to do?
[101:33.73]They invented a real lightsaber, by the way.
[101:35.55]Alright, well, I'm sure it works.
[101:42.87]Definitely doesn't.
[101:45.34]Alright, where the hell am I going here?
[101:53.36]Wrong way?
[101:54.08]Fuck.
[101:55.52]Why can't I just like say go and you go?
[101:59.14]It does.
[102:02.22]Yeah, I'm sure it does.
[102:03.60]I'm sure it works behind a bunch of, like, military glass.
[102:07.56]And a high-powered robot holds it and slashes through something.
[102:19.07]Dude, you suck at games.
[102:20.69]I didn't tell you.
[102:22.57]Look, I'm trying to find a way.
[102:28.19]It's portable.
[102:34.86]There it is.
[102:35.28]Found it.
[102:35.58]Did I?
[102:48.61]Got lucky.
[103:02.50]Do it.
[103:04.60]Look out Chewie!
[103:05.34]There's a guy behind that corner!
[103:06.64]There's quite a few of them actually.
[103:11.18]Why don't we just let them do this?
[103:18.79]Can you hold him Chewie?
[103:19.65]I don't know if that's a yes or a no.
[103:30.66]That sounded like a no.
[103:31.96]That sounded like a no.
[103:33.06]That was like a... I don't know.
[103:34.78]Okay, you're gone.
[103:35.49]Ah, Chewie in the next Rumble.
[103:49.90]Guaranteed.
[104:02.64]Use the gun for a little bit.
[104:08.40]Guns are fun in this game.
[104:09.50]Pretty cool.
[104:11.38]I don't hate them.
[104:18.69]You get to hear that cool Star Wars crunch.
[104:20.37]Alright, what do we got?
[104:33.99]I have to shoot him.
[104:39.21]Doesn't work.
[104:42.12]Of course it does.
[104:42.78]What's that?
[104:50.76]I heard something.
[104:57.81]Alright.
[105:00.47]Keep going.
[105:07.53]It's a guy that throws grenades cool How do you not do that to yourself so this is just a guy okay, he's fucking crazy get out get out of the room Get out of the room He's crazy
[105:38.41]He's not that stupid, is he?
[105:44.15]What?
[106:01.71]Heal.
[106:02.25]Thank you for the reminder.
[106:08.56]Wait.
[106:09.96]Enemy.
[106:14.21]What?
[106:15.51]Oh, I... Watch out, C-3PO.
[106:22.57]Get out of the way.
[106:30.25]R2, get out of the way, R2.
[106:31.19]Sorry, R2.
[106:41.27]Is it 3-3?
[106:41.69]I'm gonna leave him alone.
[107:07.73]But I'm going to shock him once just to... I'm going to give him supercharged powers.
[107:13.37]Now he's ultimately charged.
[107:16.07]That worked.
[107:16.47]That's the difference on droids.
[107:17.52]It gives them battery power, guys.
[107:30.92]You just ruined Star Wars.
[107:35.16]Are you sure?
[107:35.48]Are you sure I did?
[107:39.19]And it wasn't that mouse that just wears pants.
[107:45.41]Like just wears red shorts and that's it.
[107:47.03]Are you sure?
[107:57.82]Elevator?
[108:03.08]Yes, we sure are.
[108:09.01]Okay, that's it for the falcon now for the raven's claw I just heard I heard raven claw.
[108:15.66]I have one headphone in somebody tell me what happened Oh shit Let's see what you've got
[108:48.58]Squish him in the elevator.
[108:49.30]Squish him in the elevator.
[108:49.88]Get in the elevator with him.
[108:50.54]Got it.
[109:05.36]Got it.
[109:14.63]Got it.
[109:16.93]That's a side slasher.
[109:22.39]Alright, now what?
[109:22.97]In here.
[109:26.87]Two more, right?
[109:29.56]Chewbacca, get over here.
[109:49.09]Is he coming to me?
[109:55.97]Give me another fight right here.
[109:58.88]No?
[110:02.22]Oh, no.
[110:02.66]Down.
[110:02.92]Okay.
[110:06.68]Did I heal?
[110:19.75]Yeah.
[110:20.45]I knew you... I had to find him.
[110:35.59]We just go out?
[110:46.50]Alright, where's Han Solo?
[110:50.11]Han!
[110:53.11]Han, get this thing started!
[110:55.35]We gotta move, Han!
[111:06.73]Put this thing into hyperdrive.
[111:09.51]We got to get out of here, Han.
[111:14.06]Fight speed ahead.
[111:31.81]Yup.
[111:32.01]There he is.
[111:35.51]No, that's not.
[111:35.93]That's Kyle.
[111:41.05]Oh, did I miss something?
[111:43.05]What the fuck?
[111:43.77]There was so much room to not have to do that.
[111:45.53]You could have just walked around him.
[111:49.67]Good to see you too, Chewie.
[111:51.59]Guess these mercs didn't want us here.
[111:54.17]He's snapping my neck?
[111:56.63]What's going on?
[111:57.91]Oh, that's high praise coming from a Wookiee.
[112:00.85]I thought he was just going to spin and snap my neck.
[112:04.67]Someone in this cult must have a lot of credits.
[112:07.69]Or worse, it's backed by the Remnant.
[112:10.37]Listen, we gotta get back to Luke and tell him what's going on.
[112:13.04]Can you tell Leia about the cult?
[112:18.96]If he hadn't shown up when he did, I'd have been in a whole lot of trouble.
[112:23.20]Yeah, well, the way Chewie tells it, you held your own.
[112:26.47]Nice work.
[112:27.40]Thanks Chewie.
[112:28.30]I got praise from Chewie.
[112:29.26]Leg attacks.
[112:29.72]I only jumped 14 times this entire level.
[112:31.11]I used lightning more than I jumped.
[112:49.29]I have some troubling news.
[112:50.97]While Kyle and I attended to the crashed shuttle, someone broke into my quarters and sliced into my records.
[112:56.81]R2 is trying to figure out what they may be looking for.
[113:00.99]Isn't it R number two?
[113:02.99]R2?
[113:06.00]R2.
[113:09.26]So, how's your training going?
[113:11.84]I've been sent on a few errands, nothing exciting.
[113:14.28]Same here.
[113:15.08]I guess that's just how the training works.
[113:16.94]I thought it was just me.
[113:19.70]Oh, evil?
[113:19.86]Evil?
[113:20.00]Hmm.
[113:42.57]What do you think, Jaden?
[113:43.85]Well, I'm ready to get back out there.
[113:46.02]I learned electricity faster than you did.
[113:48.78]So if you want to be the evil one, you got to get in line.
[113:51.54]No, not at all.
[113:53.36]Well, I'm ready.
[113:54.02]Let's go.
[113:54.38]Alright, we got droid recovery, emergency assistance, merchant rescue.
[114:06.12]Merchant rescue.
[114:06.90]We'll do this one.
[114:09.38]The Academy has received a distress call from a merchant ship that crashed on the planet Lengiel.
[114:15.86]It was pulled out of hyperspace when they crossed paths with an interdictor cruiser.
[114:22.95]The Imperial is apparently not wanting their presence known, fired on the merchant ship.
[114:27.67]The merchants managed to make it to the planet's surface and call for help.
[114:31.15]As far as we know, the planet is uninhabited.
[114:35.56]This should be an easy assignment.
[114:37.34]I think you can handle it while Kyle is away with Rosh.
[114:40.46]Take a shuttle, land at the coordinates of the distress beacon, and pick up any survivors.
[114:44.64]Sure thing.
[114:46.13]Alright.
[114:47.57]We got lightsaber.
[114:48.43]Oh, hold on.
[114:48.83]I gotta look at these.
[114:51.71]Jedi can absorb dark force power.
[114:53.25]Force push and force pull directed at them.
[114:54.87]Okay.
[114:55.99]Better heal.
[114:57.77]Mind trap.
[114:58.19]Allows Jedi to confuse or misdirect attention.
[115:05.36]This is just like a defense.
[115:09.80]Force jump.
[115:11.28]Allows Jedi to make a tremendous vertical leap.
[115:14.13]Okay.
[115:15.67]Jedi can jump three times their normal height.
[115:19.33]Pull certain levels and objects in targeting.
[115:20.95]Can also pull an enemy.
[115:22.19]So this just makes it stronger.
[115:26.41]Use it to get out of a force grip or drain.
[115:30.31]Jedi can sense people in invisible markers at short range.
[115:32.87]Okay.
[115:35.51]33% faster than normal speed.
[115:40.23]Lightsaber defense.
[115:42.58]Can deflect projectiles and melee attacks in a small arc directly in front of them.
[115:45.92]Who cares?
[115:46.28]Has to break saber locks and parries against other Jedis.
[115:50.70]Who cares?
[115:51.08]I'll just go right for the throat.
[115:53.36]And a lightsaber flies straight from the player.
[115:55.65]Okay.
[115:59.93]Force drain.
[116:01.03]Extra lightning.
[116:05.77]I think I'm... Jedi can maintain the force lightning for a sustained forward attack.
[116:12.39]Yeah.
[116:19.17]I want the sniper rifle.
[116:20.75]And this thing is pretty cool.
[116:22.98]And I'll take the detonators.
[116:24.46]Here we go.
[116:30.88]Remember, this is the best mission in the whole game.
[116:32.50]Okay, well, I'll take your word for it.
[116:45.85]Again, we get shot down again.
[116:47.05]Anything's easy just to ride a bike to these places.
[116:51.53]Nice work, Jaden.
[116:55.17]Some rescue mission.
[116:56.83]Just land on the planet away from everything and ride a bike.

[117:28.74]They introduced that guy last scene just to get him killed by a worm.
[117:32.44]Okay.
[117:32.56]Does that guy have a name?
[117:35.56]I'm not going down there.
[117:46.33]I can wait this out.

[124:26.79]Where's the last one?
[124:32.43]Oh, shit.
[124:32.73]It's so far away.
[124:45.26]Jedi speed.
[124:46.98]That's the key is to use the Jedi speed.
[124:48.36]I haven't been using it.
[124:51.24]I can just run with Jedi speed on.
[125:04.39]Don't get cocky.
[125:07.37]What's that?
[125:10.49]Shit.
[125:10.79]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

[125:56.74]Oh.
[125:57.68]Rick.
[125:58.00]Oh.

[126:08.35]Yeah, this part sucks.
[126:13.86]Oh, fuck.

[126:23.16]Hurry!
[126:30.07]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[126:32.69]Oh, shit!
[126:34.49]Oh, did I save it?
[126:36.63]No!
[126:37.21]Idiot!
[126:37.75]You idiot!
[126:38.45]Why would you not?
[126:54.62]What an idiot.
[126:55.26]I have- why- why- I- Save it.
[126:57.45]Quick save.
[126:57.81]It's one button press.
[127:00.07]Got to get over there.
[127:09.33]Hold on.
[127:14.11]Use force kin.
[127:15.39]There you go.
[127:16.76]Are you happy?
[127:17.26]Is everybody here happy now?
[127:19.20]I don't want to be in the ground.
[127:35.69]I don't want to be in the ground.
[127:36.39]I want to be in the ground.
[127:39.24]There we go.
[127:39.64]Okay, I'm alright.
[127:43.16]No deal?
[127:43.50]I don't even care about the deal.
[127:44.26]I just want people to stop writing it.
[127:45.34]No.
[127:58.23]No, don't.
[128:02.27]Holy shit, how did I not get eaten?
[128:21.41]I got it.
[128:23.33]Done.
[128:25.63]That should do it.
[128:26.15]I had to get off this crazy rock.
[128:29.58]Get off this crazy rock.
[128:31.34]That's too bad about the merchants.
[128:33.04]That was it?
[128:33.56]Sounds like those sand burrowers must have gotten them all.
[128:35.86]Holy shit.
[128:36.46]Nasty critters.
[128:38.34]Glad you got back safe and sound.
[128:40.75]We'll let Coruscant know to mark the planet as hazardous.
[128:45.57]this is getting more serious we have been receiving reports of a sith cult called the disciples of ragnos appearing all over the galaxy okay emergency assistance or droid recovery
[129:08.07]Droid recovery.
[129:09.79]A moisture farmer on Tatooine recently overheard a group of smugglers talking about a Sith cult in a local bar and had his R5 droid record the conversation.
[129:18.90]Unfortunately, he became afraid and sold the droid to some Jawas before leaving Tatooine.
[129:24.99]We need to get a hold of that droid before the Jawas wipe its memory.
[129:28.43]Locate the Jawas, purchase the droid, and return to the Academy.
[129:34.23]Oh.
[129:35.27]Alright.
[129:36.39]Lightning 3.
[129:44.12]Jedi emanates a sustained fan of electricity in a large forward arc, damaging anything in front of them.
[129:48.92]Sounds good to me.
[129:57.08]I want it.
[130:01.56]Uh, this is a droid level, so we're gonna have to go with droid-specific items.
[130:05.59]Okay.
[130:10.75]Blue milk?
[130:12.33]Jawa's.
[130:13.40]Never around when you need them.
[130:16.98]Tracks.
[130:18.24]Maybe they've already come and gone.
[130:21.91]Moisture farmers?
[130:22.69]Are they?
[130:23.05]Every time I've seen a Jawa in Star Wars, aren't they just taking apart robots and attacking people?
[130:27.35]You're a fake fan.
[130:27.99]Am I?
[130:28.25]Am I?
[130:52.64]Oh, we gotta fight.
[130:54.52]We gotta fight.
[130:56.94]We gotta fight.
[130:58.72]Jawas versus... Dude, shoot him.
[131:16.47]Okay.
[131:16.69]I didn't mean to do that.
[131:25.58]Oh, he just saw that.
[131:28.35]Don't tell anybody about that.
[131:29.59]Do it.
[131:49.60]Oh, now I understand what they mean when you just have so much power.
[131:52.26]You just can't help it.
[131:53.26]You have unlimited power.
[132:02.10]The dark side is just too strong.
[132:03.54]I should have electricity in my hands.
[132:04.88]People could fly in.
[132:08.94]Holy shit.
[132:16.54]This feels very, very good.
[132:18.86]That, I'm... Oh my god, dude.
[132:27.50]Sniper!
[132:34.02]Oh my fucking... It doesn't work that way.
[132:41.66]I just look angry.
[132:44.60]What the fuck is happening?
[132:46.37]Oh, there's people.
[132:47.35]I was like, why am I getting hit when I fire the gun?
[133:01.20]Alright, Jedi mind heal.
[133:08.27]Whoa, that's a perfect room to just go in there and just go...
[133:36.77]That move is unbelievable.
[133:38.33]This move is incredible.
[133:40.19]I'm unstoppable.
[133:42.07]No one has any chance to beat me.
[133:44.07]No one.
[133:47.98]Even the Emperor.
[133:49.38]He can't do this shit.
[133:51.70]They should be concerned about me now because I have actually unlimited power with my lightning.
[133:56.62]I went all into the lightning.
[133:59.04]I didn't even train a lightsaber move.
[134:03.55]I went right for that book in Harry Potter right in the back of that room.
[134:07.92]I just opened it up.
[134:08.48]I didn't care about a wand.
[134:09.58]I don't even have a wand yet.
[134:11.00]I don't give a shit.
[134:14.39]Oh, the wand chooses the witch.
[134:15.83]I don't care.
[134:16.69]I don't fucking even want a wand.
[134:18.07]Don't even give me one.
[134:20.85]Just give me that book in the back that has all the magic fucked up shit in it.
[134:40.32]He's mad with power.
[134:47.41]They'd have to make a new house for me.
[134:49.15]I'd be so strong.
[134:49.83]You know what I mean?
[134:50.79]Oh, you're Gryffindor.
[134:52.33]Ravenclaw.
[134:53.25]Slytherin.
[134:55.70]Jeremy.
[134:58.00]I sit alone at lunch.
[135:19.09]Oh my god, you are slaughtering them.
[135:26.45]I am just... Look.
[135:32.24]Look.
[135:34.08]I'm unbeatable.
[135:35.72]And I'm going to try to... I'm going to save the galaxy.
[135:41.76]I just... You find me somebody.
[135:43.12]You find me the bad guy and just point me at him.
[135:51.89]You are the bad guy.
[135:53.69]To me.
[135:55.51]You find me the bad guy.
[135:56.91]Go ahead.
[135:57.97]Point to him.
[135:58.69]And you say, uh, Jeremy, you should, uh, that's the bad guy.
[136:02.08]Well, I have to examine that first.
[136:04.80]And go over what you mean.
[136:05.86]What did they do?
[136:06.40]They, uh, they are trying to rule the galaxy.
[136:09.78]They're trying to take over the world and use a Death Star.
[136:12.08]Okay.
[136:12.86]Alright.
[136:13.24]Okay.
[136:14.36]How big is the Death Star?
[136:16.40]It's as big as an entire planet.
[136:19.46]Alright.
[136:20.02]I can handle that.
[136:26.70]This is not the droid we're looking for.
[136:28.33]Well, I'm not looking for him.
[136:41.85]Well, now someone's going to be looking for that droid.
[136:44.07]The guy who owns this house is going to come out and be like, where the fuck happened to G3PO?
[137:01.15]Where?
[137:08.62]Oh.
[137:09.12]Yeah.
[137:09.44]Okay.
[137:11.42]In the face.
[137:11.94]Immediately dead.
[137:12.56]In an instant.
[137:13.36]Instant one headshot.
[137:26.41]All you have to do...
[137:28.49]I would just have to come in here and hold my hands up.
[137:30.63]Like, out.
[137:31.43]Forward.
[137:33.23]I wouldn't have to do any electricity.
[137:35.92]I wouldn't have to even hurt anybody.
[137:40.28]And people would just be like, okay, get out of his way.
[137:42.58]Get the fuck out of this guy's way.
[137:43.74]We know what he does.
[137:44.36]We know who he is.
[137:46.55]That's Jeremy from House Jeremy.
[137:50.47]Everybody, just everybody leave.
[137:58.70]Just leave.
[137:59.18]Everyone leave.
[138:00.80]What does he want?
[138:01.30]It's great.
[138:06.51]See?
[138:06.63]I chose the side of good.
[138:07.41]I chose the side of good.
[138:19.87]I keep hearing somewhere in my ear, deeply, like into my brain somewhere.
[138:24.73]I just keep hearing, do it.
[138:26.59]I don't know who it is.
[138:27.13]I don't know what they're talking about.
[138:28.47]I don't know what they want me to do.
[138:30.65]But they're in my head.
[138:32.71]Okay, maybe just a little.
[138:41.11]Is that what you wanted me to do?
[138:45.26]Do that?
[138:45.66]Do this?
[138:54.69]Gentlemen?
[138:55.79]Good to see you, gentlemen.
[138:58.69]Good.
[138:59.21]No, not that one.
[139:02.95]He's turning to the dark side.
[139:05.15]No, I'm not.
[139:05.69]I can control it.
[139:11.32]Really wish I had more control to launch them up over the... Okay, now you... That's all.
[139:19.68]Just get behind him.
[139:22.26]Just distract him.
[139:24.78]Just distract him long enough for somebody to come and just butt him in the head with a rifle.
[139:29.82]Most powerful being in the universe still has like a soft head.
[139:36.01]So, you know, I guess that's true.
[139:43.84]How do I get up there?
[140:16.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[140:17.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[140:17.74]Come back.
[140:20.14]Oh, man.
[140:20.56]When I get up there, I'm electrocuting whoever's up there.
[140:22.44]I don't even care.
[140:25.98]Oh.
[140:39.80]Let's go.
[140:52.22]What happened?
[140:54.08]What happened?
[140:56.00]Oh no, he's here.
[141:04.94]I feel like they're all running around going, oh no, it's, it's Lu Bu.
[141:09.91]Lu Bu is here.
[141:10.91]Oh shit.
[141:34.87]He didn't see that?
[141:39.24]He doesn't know.
[141:39.88]Okay.
[141:40.58]Apparently not.
[141:46.90]Oh, man.
[141:48.38]Okay.
[141:49.10]Party's over.
[141:50.00]Party's over.
[141:51.05]Party's over.
[141:54.83]I don't know how to do that.
[141:59.05]I don't know how to use a lightsaber.
[142:09.10]What am I doing?
[142:12.22]Alright, let me heal.
[142:16.58]I'm going to get the full health.
[142:27.78]I probably should do heal too, right?
[142:34.09]That just will make it much quicker.
[142:37.40]Alright, that's good.
[142:37.98]Good enough, good enough.
[142:38.62]That's good, good, good, good, good.
[142:39.56]Okay.
[142:47.43]Can I put the lightsaber just away?
[142:48.99]Is there a sheath?
[142:51.19]I don't even want to use it.
[142:52.46]Phew.
[142:58.30]Let's press 1.
[143:10.27]The lightsaber just kind of gets in the way.
[143:16.57]Okay, out of here.
[143:17.03]Alright, what's this open?
[143:18.55]Think fast.
[143:32.37]Think fast!
[143:35.22]How do I get down there?
[143:47.52]How do I get down there?
[143:49.56]How do I do that?
[143:50.14]Oh my goodness.
[143:52.75]What should I do?
[143:59.27]What do I do?
[143:59.71]I don't know.
[144:00.25]Speed.
[144:17.20]Speed.
[144:20.44]Oh.
[144:22.94]Oh, you guys alright?
[144:23.58]Do I need to save them?
[144:37.63]Alright, let's go.
[144:41.30]Oh.
[144:52.56]I did it.
[144:52.86]I saved you.
[144:55.80]You are free to go.
[144:58.64]Look.
[145:01.80]Look, you can move.
[145:06.02]I want you to... I ain't saying it again.
[145:07.50]Hands come up.
[145:08.36]Both hands come out forward.
[145:09.26]I ain't saying it again.
[145:10.00]Let's go.
[145:10.88]I'm trying to rescue mission here.
[145:39.42]Instantly dead?
[145:40.32]Okay, that's... Whatever.
[145:47.51]No lightsaber.
[145:48.15]What are you doing?
[145:49.45]Wasting energy.
[145:50.11]Uh, is it on timer?
[145:52.59]I think I've... Oh my god, he shot me right in the head.
[145:57.31]Just...
[146:02.49]Hey, Jerma, here's a can of whoop-ass.
[146:07.11]Really?
[146:07.37]Can of whoop-ass.
[146:14.95]What are you, stone cold?
[146:23.45]Actually, Jerma, lightsabers recycle power.
[146:27.47]I'm good.
[146:28.76]And that hurt a lot, but I'm good.
[146:34.02]Alright, what's this link spam?
[146:35.56]What are you guys doing?
[146:36.42]What's going on here?
[146:38.56]Jerma95 debt relief album cover art.
[146:41.27]Jerma has made song after song throughout his YouTube and streaming career, whether it be the Rat Birthday mixtape, the Giant Enemy Spider, or the Banana Bros anthem.
[146:50.28]He's made musical masterpieces, but none of these
[146:54.20]Uh, musical masterpieces have been collected in an album.
[146:58.25]Hopefully, after this deal, that can change.
[147:00.21]Here below, you can see the price negotiations.
[147:02.31]We hope you accept, Mr. Elbertson.
[147:03.99]Okay.
[147:04.29]$100 million for covers of a song, $200 million for extended versions of the songs, $300 million for completely new songs, and $1 billion for an official Raid song.
[147:14.62]Okay.
[147:16.16]Well.
[147:19.37]Beatboxes are acceptable.
[147:22.04]Let me think about this and take the first break of the evening.
[147:23.85]I'll be right back.
[150:21.96]Hello.
[150:26.26]And we're back.
[150:29.22]Um... Maybe we'll vote on this, maybe.
[150:34.32]Eventually.
[150:34.77]Uh, I'm interested in the deal.
[150:38.99]But I'm not, uh... I'm not saying yes to it yet.
[150:46.41]Hold on, I'm currently being, like... I'm currently being, like, burnt.
[150:49.15]Let's come back.
[150:54.14]Catboy, yep.
[150:56.86]Put on the ears.
[150:58.06]Look at all this Catboy.
[151:02.74]Catboy, Catboy, Catboy this, Catboy that, Catboy this.
[151:09.25]Catboy!
[151:17.55]What did that do?
[151:18.41]Oh, I turned it off.
[151:19.17]You can go.
[151:20.53]Go, go, go.
[151:21.07]You're good.
[151:21.99]Go through.
[151:23.58]Go through, hands up.
[151:24.84]I'm not gonna... Alright.
[151:32.46]I just hit him with like the peripheral.
[151:33.90]Whatever.
[151:36.18]Don't go that way.
[151:37.38]That's where fire is.
[151:47.57]Um, what did I just do?
[151:48.43]Oh, okay.
[151:50.05]Elevator?
[151:53.54]Where's Sluggerba?
[151:54.46]Where's Sluggerba?
[151:59.19]Oh, shit.
[152:03.65]Somebody was still alive.
[152:09.61]Is there a Lightning 4?
[152:10.25]Can you do Lightning 4?
[152:24.22]I just killed like 10 people.
[152:25.28]I don't know who's over there.
[152:27.62]Just guessed.
[152:40.25]Alright, got him.
[152:43.25]Lightning 10 is a nuke.
[152:45.84]Is it?
[152:50.10]You're okay.
[152:51.28]You must be the droid we were sent for.
[152:53.40]But it doesn't look like there's any Jawas left to negotiate with.
[152:57.18]Well, I guess you better just follow me.
[152:59.89]Follow me?
[153:01.13]Alright, let's go.
[153:11.27]Don't go out there.
[153:12.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[153:13.47]It's not safe.
[153:16.26]It's not safe.
[153:16.78]It's not safe out there.
[153:19.96]Now it is.
[153:21.63]Alright, let's go.
[153:29.32]Do I even need to be at the academy anymore?
[153:30.82]This guy with training is not... This is terrifying.
[153:44.87]Wait, what?
[153:45.49]82 people killed?
[153:46.41]Wait, what do you mean, next mission?
[154:20.70]next mission I couldn't even go back to the academy I only got one more officials from the planet bakura have requested our assistance an unknown party is taking control of a power station up in the mountains they sent a team to investigate but they haven't reported in
[154:46.85]Oh, you can skip one mission per set of five.
[154:48.23]Oh.
[154:48.31]Should I even do this then?
[155:22.51]Yes.
[155:22.87]Okay.
[155:24.53]Alright, so I have lightning.
[155:25.97]Now I can do force choke.
[155:29.73]Force grip.
[155:31.73]Grain.
[155:35.44]Lightning.
[155:36.06]I can't do any more points into lightning.
[155:39.32]Force grip.
[155:39.96]I think the weapons don't really matter.
[156:03.43]OK.
[156:04.57]Mission 5.
[156:04.91]Oh.
[156:05.33]How long is this game?
[156:06.41]I'm just bored.
[156:07.43]It's pretty long.
[156:08.59]It's 50 hours.
[156:08.83]What the hell are you talking about?
[156:10.87]Hold on.
[156:28.64]Okay, force powers.
[156:30.00]We got heal, lightning, grip.
[156:33.02]That was three.
[156:40.24]Like 10 hours?
[156:40.88]Oh, okay.
[156:56.51]So Kyle's in trouble then.
[157:07.69]Where is this guy?
[157:10.84]Man.
[157:13.44]This is where I get into a little bit of trouble because I get bored, right?
[157:16.98]I go into the side room and there's like a bunch of potions in there and I pick one up and I drop it.
[157:25.81]Stuck in here.
[157:39.14]The charges are set, sir.
[157:43.64]Good.
[157:44.20]The Republic is getting complacent.
[157:46.20]They underestimated us.
[157:48.00]This will remind them what happens to traitors.
[157:52.71]Hmm.
[157:55.91]So, I can stop them?
[157:57.59]They're going to blow the whole installation.
[157:59.47]I have to stop that countdown.
[158:01.73]Oh.
[158:05.54]Alright, we gotta stop the count-
[158:12.25]I'm under arrest?
[158:14.29]Oh, hi guys.
[158:26.79]I was just testing my new move out.
[158:35.68]And it sucks.
[158:40.52]Hmm.
[158:47.10]I don't have to do anything, man.
[158:48.26]I'm unbeatable.
[158:50.82]No one can stop me, even if there's a boss.
[158:54.05]Who the fuck were you guys?
[158:57.19]Did you guys spawn in?
[159:06.06]Press all the buttons.
[159:06.86]Just press every button on the machine.
[159:08.34]Who cares?
[159:15.56]Uh-oh.
[159:17.76]Hold on.
[159:18.28]I gotta take care of this.
[159:21.17]The one thing that can stop me is environmental death.
[159:23.61]We're good.
[159:44.38]Nice.
[159:45.22]Got it.
[159:47.50]Watch out for the gas.
[159:58.36]Easy way to deal with this.
[159:59.94]Oops.
[160:03.22]How did I jump over that?
[160:04.20]What?
[160:06.52]I got the security key.
[160:07.88]Nice.
[160:08.18]Okay.
[160:12.18]I'm too powerful.
[160:18.12]I became way too powerful, way too quickly.
[160:20.94]Oh, it's the bomb.
[160:29.17]Okay, wait, wait.
[160:29.61]Easy, easy.
[160:30.05]Bomb.
[160:30.27]What's the difficulty of?
[160:33.91]I don't think that's going to do anything.
[160:36.25]Four more to go.
[160:47.46]Now you need an apprentice.
[160:51.50]I don't think that works.
[160:53.56]I can't have an apprentice.
[160:54.52]I can't teach somebody how to do this.
[160:57.06]I'm the only one that can.
[161:07.07]Should I go back up?
[161:12.37]Okay.
[161:13.68]Well, I'm just going back up.
[161:19.26]What did I come down here for?
[161:20.12]Jump in the pit for a funny laugh.
[161:23.00]OK, that would be really funny, actually.
[161:24.50]God damn it, man.
[161:41.78]Bring it.
[161:42.24]Let's go bring it down.
[161:54.60]I just want me to cry.

[162:47.20]Right.
[162:47.46]Well, I... Oh.
[162:58.13]Why is it all the way down here?
[163:02.67]That's a hard... That's a terrible place for that.

[164:02.98]I guess I'll use it for a minute or two.
[164:09.45]What's another cool move to get?
[164:12.43]Be careful.
[164:13.03]Don't be an idiot.
[164:14.19]I don't want to accidentally blow this up.
[164:15.73]So we're going to go from here and go that way.
[164:18.43]See, I'm careful.
[164:20.62]Look at how careful I was being.
[164:22.25]Three more.
[164:23.99]Three more.
[164:24.59]This level sucks.
[164:25.33]To be honest with you.
[164:29.95]Is this why you guys told me to do this?
[164:39.42]Everybody's like, do this one, do this one, next, next.
[164:41.38]Because you know this one was bad.
[164:53.51]Where's this taking me?
[165:00.81]You're gonna get lost?
[165:01.61]Oh, I found a secret.
[165:03.67]What does that mean?
[165:08.64]Oh, I have the Jedi mind look.
[165:11.72]I'll find it eventually.
[165:19.34]I'm going to stop flirting.
[165:20.16]I almost just got crushed.
[165:22.34]Sorry.
[165:22.96]Stop flirting with chat and play the game.

[165:25.52]I am.
[165:25.78]Alright.
[165:29.85]This one back here.
[165:30.39]This is the one I already got.
[165:38.73]Where's the next one?
[165:41.19]We're going to go, I guess, over here.
[165:51.56]I don't even know who... didn't even know you were there.
[165:55.47]You weren't even on my radar.
[165:56.59]I don't think I can do this one.
[166:02.85]Can't go from here.
[166:05.33]Shit.
[166:05.69]Okay, well, whatever.
[166:14.64]Coward, coward, coward, coward.
[166:18.89]Force the wall run.
[166:19.91]Can I get in here with it?
[166:22.65]I need a key card or something.
[166:25.59]Well, this is dumb.
[166:30.32]Can you fart for us?
[166:31.30]No.
[166:33.30]Thanks.
[166:36.16]Is that one up there done or does that one need to be done?
[166:41.74]I need to do that one.
[166:43.58]I think I can make this.
[167:06.21]Elevator and then go up and disarm it.
[167:10.61]Fart now.
[167:11.19]Fart now.

[167:23.27]Two more.
[167:24.04]Where are they?
[167:27.46]Is that one done?
[167:28.62]I can't tell.
[167:29.30]Let's get the sniper rifle out.
[167:30.30]That one's done.
[167:32.88]This one's done.
[167:36.40]That one's done.
[167:37.08]Alright.
[167:37.50]All three over here are done.
[167:40.01]Now we go this way.
[167:40.99]Back over here.

[167:43.65]Where are the other ones?
[167:44.81]I only see... Holy fuck.
[167:46.43]I thought I fell off.
[167:52.05]Do a force fart.
[167:55.73]I don't think I want to do that.
[167:56.77]A force fart is just shit your pants on... I'm not... No.
[168:00.21]You don't force.
[168:00.99]That's what happens.
[168:13.06]That's a force fart.
[168:13.96]And I'm not doing that.
[168:30.77]Worst noise.
[168:31.93]No, it wasn't.
[168:32.57]It was fine.
[168:57.46]Force puke.
[169:00.28]Force puke in mother's bed.
[169:01.56]Oh my god.
[169:04.30]Alright, so how can I get in here?
[169:06.65]This level sucks.
[169:12.65]This level sucks.
[169:14.27]Level sucks.
[169:21.31]This level sucks.
[169:25.89]This level sucks.
[169:27.83]I didn't do this one.
[169:28.83]Oh, I did.
[169:34.90]Where are the other ones?
[169:38.58]What the fuck?
[169:44.16]Um.
[169:48.33]We're in a circle.
[169:49.13]Yeah, well, where am I supposed to go?
[169:54.96]Was the command to just complete a level?
[169:58.42]This one's... I don't like this one.
[169:59.58]I don't want to do this one.
[170:02.79]Force just fall off.
[170:11.45]Soft lock.
[170:14.08]You're almost done?
[170:15.48]Yeah, but I can't... How am I supposed to get at?
[170:17.08]I don't know where to go.
[170:17.74]Can I get in there?
[170:32.45]Hook up the guide.
[170:33.15]Go back through the door.
[170:34.53]Alright, I'm through the door.
[170:37.53]And then I can go down this way or I can go back through here.
[170:43.20]Back through... Force pretending.
[170:54.18]No, this brings me... Force pretending.
[171:00.01]Okay.
[171:05.77]Forcing a joke.
[171:06.75]Forced joke.
[171:21.04]Save it here.
[171:21.70]Now I can go this way.
[171:22.80]Or down.
[171:24.00]I'm going to try it this way.
[171:28.33]Down.
[171:34.88]Okay.
[171:35.36]Of course, look.
[171:38.98]One up there I got.
[171:39.64]There's one over here.
[171:40.30]Which I didn't get.
[171:41.70]I remember this part.
[171:55.69]Can't get in this door.
[171:56.53]I got that one.
[172:11.48]Kirby air ride waiting room.
[172:18.76]I'm not playing that game.
[172:24.56]Here.
[172:34.49]Here.
[172:39.79]And.
[172:46.17]In here?
[172:46.57]What is this thing?
[172:49.98]Key on corpse.
[172:55.12]Key?
[172:55.52]Where is it?
[172:56.36]This guy?
[173:05.61]Give me a fucking break.
[173:06.75]Don't blow it up.
[173:09.80]I was trying to shoot him.
[173:15.36]Okay, that opens.
[173:17.62]Where's that door?
[173:18.48]It's over here somewhere.
[173:19.54]I saw it.
[173:20.08]I ran by it.
[173:20.82]Where is it?
[173:23.33]Where's that door?
[173:24.25]It's a red door.
[173:27.41]I can't.
[173:27.91]I couldn't.
[173:28.17]There it is.
[173:43.17]Goodbye.
[173:44.93]You just got electrocuted.
[173:54.62]Oh, no.
[173:55.26]I'm too good at the game now.
[173:56.96]And even with a high difficulty, it wouldn't even change anything.
[174:05.23]I can't wait to fight a boss and just kill the boss instantly off a cliff.
[174:24.02]Got him.
[174:29.80]Bomb right there.
[174:38.79]Now that was fucking cool.
[174:40.39]Alright.
[174:40.75]That was really cool.
[174:46.74]One more.
[174:48.36]Where is the last one?
[174:56.87]One final one remains and then I can get the heck out of here.
[175:15.17]Please.
[175:25.33]Alright.
[175:27.03]No.
[175:31.72]I'm going to cross this way.
[175:33.10]Don't go down.
[175:33.60]Go across.
[175:39.80]There it is.
[175:40.20]There it is.
[175:42.45]I win.
[175:43.89]I win.
[175:44.31]I win.
[175:44.95]Where's the ship?
[176:04.16]Did these guys even do anything?
[176:15.46]Where's the ship?
[176:16.90]Okay, I think it's this way.
[176:18.14]I feel like I'm hacking.
[176:23.36]I put in cheat codes to make the game impossible to lose.
[176:31.76]You ba- You bad?
[176:35.80]Oh, you're good.
[176:57.28]I didn't kill the droid.
[176:58.89]It just went...
[177:08.11]It was one little blaster.
[177:09.49]He's going to be fine.
[177:13.83]Where the hell did I just go?
[177:16.90]Oh, come on.
[177:18.16]No, get.
[177:21.78]Level sucks.
[177:22.66]Level sucks.
[177:23.58]Level sucks.
[177:24.44]Level sucks.
[177:44.66]Now, where the hell do I go?
[177:46.06]Back this way, right?
[177:58.48]Move.
[178:00.44]Move.
[178:02.32]Move.
[178:04.65]Up.
[178:10.41]Down.
[178:13.90]Goodbye!
[178:27.89]There's my ship!
[178:35.22]Force change your difficulty.
[178:41.17]stronger than the emperor by far he couldn't do this sorry I never made it to bakura you seem to handle yourself okay though
[179:04.43]something's come up we need you back at the academy alright let's go look jaden I know better than almost anyone here that the dark side is tempting especially in the middle of a fight wait you better watch it okay wait wait wait he's being he's getting concerned jaden I was looking at how many people you've killed
[179:27.24]It's over 50 per mission.
[179:30.45]Maybe.
[179:31.33]Maybe put a couple points in to jump.
[179:35.03]Maybe to heal.
[179:40.17]I've called you all here to relay some disturbing news.
[179:43.31]Someone sliced into my personal records and accessed some highly sensitive data about places where I felt a strong connection to the Force.
[179:50.62]Places like Cloud City, Hoth, and Bish.
[179:54.00]What could they get from that besides a tour?
[179:56.29]Something nasty.
[179:57.55]I believe that the scepter Jaden saw was somehow used to drain the residual Force power from the Masasi Temple.
[180:03.73]Drain the Force?
[180:05.27]How can anyone do that?
[180:06.97]I'm not sure.
[180:08.38]But I've learned from the Jedi Holocron that devices were created in the past that could absorb and store force energy.
[180:14.96]Those people Jaden saw may have discovered some way to harvest force power with that scepter.
[180:20.21]Which could be dangerous indeed.
[180:24.57]So what are we gonna do?
[180:25.95]We'll have to investigate any locations from our records.
[180:28.87]That includes all of you students.
[180:30.41]This guy.
[180:32.20]Mad eyes.
[180:33.22]Pissed off eyes.
[180:37.47]Finally, some real action.
[180:39.24]Why would they be stealing Force power?
[180:41.46]I don't know.
[180:42.66]You worry too much, Jaden.
[180:44.12]I bet that these cult guys can't take on a Jedi.
[180:46.91]Well, we're not Jedi yet.
[180:48.63]We're just students.
[180:50.99]You may be just students.
[180:53.03]We're junior heroes.
[180:55.15]So don't rush it.
[180:56.31]Jaden, I'm sending you to Hoth, where I had a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[181:01.19]I imagine there was a pretty strong aura there.
[181:03.65]Rosh, I'm sending you to the remains of the planet Biss.
[181:06.72]It's very remote, so I doubt the cult has been there.
[181:09.68]Don't stay too long.
[181:11.06]The Imperial Remnant may still be operating in the area.
[181:14.08]No problem.
[181:15.14]That's everyone then.
[181:15.94]May the force be with all of you.
[181:19.74]And also with you.
[181:22.22]Call me if you need any help.
[181:32.04]Let's go.
[181:35.06]Investigate the site of Luke's vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[181:39.84]Ah.
[181:39.94]Of course I never heard that is.
[181:42.70]It's me.
[181:43.54]That's not how he talks, but whatever.
[182:01.26]Alright.
[182:04.16]I got my electrical amplification device.
[182:09.14]Or a giant calculator.
[182:12.03]Not sure which one it is.
[182:13.11]Or the fart part of a cash register.
[182:20.89]Am I giving this the finger?
[182:24.56]Whatever it is.
[182:25.00]Is Master Skywalker wrong about this place?
[182:35.69]What is that?
[182:36.13]Come here.
[182:36.40]Come here.
[182:36.68]I want to get on one of you.
[182:43.10]Come here.
[182:43.52]Get over here.
[182:44.12]Get over here.
[183:05.22]I'm just gonna follow the beacons.
[183:06.14]Oh my god!
[183:08.80]Wait, what about my friend?
[183:10.97]I can't just leave him hanging.
[183:20.37]I can.
[183:43.70]You wanna go?
[183:46.20]I don't think you know who you're fucking with here.
[183:48.98]Do it!
[183:57.65]Is he dead?
[184:12.93]Now you're a little scared.
[184:13.99]I am the most impossible to destroy being in the universe.
[184:20.78]You want to taunt?
[184:21.86]Goodbye.
[184:25.82]He survived.
[184:26.38]He's the chosen one.
[184:28.32]That's me.
[184:28.74]I just have to use it for a little bit because it's kind of like a car.
[184:40.86]Like, you gotta use your car's battery for it to work.
[184:42.88]Otherwise, if you don't use it, it could just fucking not turn on.
[184:45.18]So... Just gotta use it for a little bit.
[184:50.45]We're going the right way.
[184:55.81]Okay.
[185:10.60]I think that guy's whole body came off.
[185:14.56]Come here, I want to get on you.
[185:22.57]Somebody there?
[185:24.49]Someone there?
[185:25.23]Oh shit, an AT-ST.
[185:30.09]This is the ultimate test of the ultimate power.
[185:43.17]oh shit that's a bad place to save stay back stay back stay back stay back
[186:12.30]Hey, that's supposed to be over here.
[186:30.20]Horse hide, whatever.
[186:43.67]Lightsaber.
[186:45.39]Lightsaber.
[186:46.95]It's my friend.
[186:48.75]I'm coming.
[186:51.87]I can't open it from this side.
[186:58.64]Stuck in here?
[187:13.90]Let's go.
[187:17.64]No one is safe.
[187:19.26]No one.
[187:21.06]Not when I show up.
[187:24.33]No one is safe.
[187:30.73]What did that do?
[187:43.00]Secret.
[187:43.57]Ooh, a secret area.
[187:44.31]Cool.
[187:45.27]Grenades.
[187:47.39]Um, food, health.
[187:57.38]What did that button press do?
[188:05.13]I, I'm not, I don't know.
[188:05.97]I'm not sure.
[188:11.84]You just summoned Boba Fett.
[188:15.74]You did?
[188:16.02]Oh no, how do I fight him?
[188:20.43]How am I ever going to beat him?
[188:24.39]What door did I just open?
[188:29.82]Um, down?
[188:50.29]How will I ever beat Boba Fett?
[188:52.67]He's going to show up and he's going to have a rocket launcher.
[188:58.01]It's going to be impossible.
[188:59.20]Top three every race.
[189:25.45]What just happened?
[189:34.45]Massacre.
[189:35.42]The little toaster bot.
[189:36.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[189:37.24]I have to kill the toaster.
[189:41.72]Alright, you get to live.
[189:43.30]You get to live.
[189:44.24]You took, you get to live.
[189:45.76]You took, alright, now, now, yeah.
[189:47.42]What the fuck do you think you were gonna do?
[190:02.81]Boss is not going to have any time to even do his monolog.
[190:07.91]Right now, the boss has seized the cameras here.
[190:11.09]And he's just like, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[190:13.67]Shuffling papers.
[190:14.99]It's like my fucking speech.
[190:16.35]Hold on.
[190:16.71]I wasn't ready for this.
[190:18.99]How dare you enter my domain without asking and without express permission.
[190:22.74]And my... No, that's wrong.
[190:24.38]He's going to know.
[190:25.24]I'm scared.
[190:27.65]I didn't have time to memorize my lines.
[190:31.60]Oh, cool.
[190:34.60]Oh, nice.
[190:34.98]I don't even need to use it.
[190:50.50]Who needs the super cannon?
[190:54.80]I cannot be stopped.
[191:08.59]Follow the beacons.
[191:10.97]I mean, this guy's just running through.
[191:14.98]This is fucking terrifying.
[191:23.87]Beacon.
[191:25.29]Follow the beacons.
[191:32.73]I'm just playing Battlefront 2 and I get to randomly get to be one of the heroes.
[191:49.77]I'm having lots of fun.
[191:55.83]How did they get in?
[191:58.66]I don't know, man.
[192:00.61]Maybe there's a secret entrance somewhere.
[192:02.09]I'll use my force look.
[192:03.99]I don't see anything.
[192:27.88]You guys see something?
[192:30.61]I don't see anything.
[192:43.60]Maybe around the back?
[192:46.36]What do you guys think?
[192:48.64]In the comments of this video, you tell me what you think I should look.
[192:55.36]I'm thinking maybe up top.
[192:56.76]What do you think?
[193:08.30]I don't know what to do.
[193:18.62]We get 5k likes.
[193:24.59]They literally told you to get in the AT-AT.
[193:26.55]They did?
[193:31.40]I'm sorry, I was too busy killing everything and having no contest.
[193:53.52]Where's the AT-AT?
[194:03.72]Get in there.
[194:05.00]What do you think?
[194:05.46]I'm trying to find one.
[194:08.28]There it is.
[194:11.26]Get in this?
[194:13.12]I can't get in it.
[194:27.19]It's shooting at you?
[194:35.89]Hey!
[194:46.72]Getting sniped.
[194:47.68]Yeah, whatever.
[194:48.40]Alright, I'm safe right here.
[194:57.07]Relax.
[194:59.23]Recharge.
[195:00.77]Heal.
[195:04.93]Recharge.
[195:06.09]Heal.
[195:09.13]500 million off the debt if you stop using the lightning.
[195:13.15]You may as well tell me to stop playing the game.
[195:30.16]Something exploded behind us.
[195:31.24]I have no idea what it was.
[195:32.04]Alright.
[195:32.34]I got to get in here.
[195:33.84]Do I get in?
[195:37.02]oh shit alright alright alright I made it I made it I made it I made it get in when I get in there you're gonna get electrocuted dude
[196:10.14]Why can I not just get in here?
[196:11.00]Shoot...
[196:43.06]I tried, I tried, I tried to do it like five times.
[196:45.96]I had to do it in first person apparently.
[196:52.70]Alright, now what?
[197:11.93]What happened?
[197:18.71]What's the difficulty of?
[197:19.43]I like watching winners, not losers.
[197:23.61]It's on normal difficulty just because I picked the really strong dark side move.
[197:31.72]I can't play the dark side character?
[197:33.82]It's the most powerful in the universe, but you are a bad guy.
[197:47.19]This is a lesson to all of you.
[197:49.57]Alright, what's the new objective?
[198:11.63]That's kind of fun.
[198:18.55]Or the head.
[198:27.63]They were just heating up by the space heater.
[198:31.44]I kind of feel bad about that one.
[198:33.28]But, I mean, this is the empire.
[198:35.88]This is the evil empire.
[198:39.12]What?
[198:39.50]So the evil empire can't be destroyed by another evil empire?
[198:42.58]What are you trying to say?
[198:48.12]Look, I might be evil, but they're evil too.
[198:50.68]It's evil versus evil right now.
[198:53.08]Nobody would rather win.
[198:55.64]It's just bad guy versus bad guy.
[198:57.71]There is no good guy right now.
[199:05.73]Press M. Discover what the Imperials are doing in Echo Base.
[199:30.46]I'm not going to do it.
[199:31.46]Don't worry.
[199:32.04]I don't even need a health pack.
[199:39.97]I have free health.
[199:40.69]Hi, guys.
[199:55.99]Oh, you lived.
[199:57.11]Look at you.
[199:57.61]You lived.
[200:00.53]Not for long.
[200:04.29]What's next?
[200:05.77]How you doing?
[200:06.19]Research?
[200:07.58]Cool.
[200:13.12]I'm not... You get to live because you remind me of an old Pepsi bottle.
[200:16.74]You're an old, like, crystal Pepsi.
[200:17.97]You get to live.
[200:21.17]Or do you?
[200:21.47]Because crystal Pepsi was fucking gross.
[200:45.08]Pure evil.
[200:49.12]Unlimited power!
[200:56.05]Unlimited power, but still can't figure out how to fucking leave a base.
[201:00.93]Sense of direction, awful.
[201:02.05]Don't matter.
[201:03.57]IQ, horrible.
[201:04.95]Doesn't matter.
[201:10.04]None of that matters.
[201:11.86]All that matters is power.
[201:15.24]Power!
[201:19.78]But he's an idiot.
[201:21.60]You think that matters?
[201:22.80]Look what's happening.
[201:24.11]What matters right now?
[201:26.07]Power.
[201:33.35]Total power.
[201:34.11]And then we hide.
[201:42.04]We hide because I don't have any power left.
[201:55.75]It's starting to affect me a little.
[201:58.51]I think too much electricity is starting to affect me.
[202:00.33]My hair is standing on end.
[202:02.83]This guy would be running through the halls with this huge static electricity here.
[202:08.05]Burnt like ears.
[202:09.11]His clothes, he'd have like burnt singed ends of all of his t-shirts and shit.
[202:24.26]Yeah, like Marv in Home Alone.
[202:27.52]Just imagine Marv in Home Alone running around with a cloak on.
[202:39.41]Oh, too many computers in here.
[202:40.75]I can't do this.
[202:45.01]Command center to Allura.
[202:46.35]Allura here.
[202:47.60]We've just finished downloading the data.
[202:49.98]The rebels must have erased everything during the evacuation.
[202:52.96]Fortunately, the computer kept logging their flight information.
[202:56.59]And?
[202:57.25]And we found Rogue Leader's flight trajectory when he left Hoth.
[203:00.53]From it, we've been able to determine that Skywalker went to Dagobah.
[203:03.77]Dagobah.
[203:05.41]That sneaky little Jedi.
[203:31.29]What?
[203:34.37]I didn't even save the game.
[203:35.63]I didn't think I was ever going to need to.
[203:39.79]He just cut me in half.
[203:44.51]I was on low battery.
[203:48.47]Crazed electrocutor.
[203:58.05]Oh shit.
[204:00.72]Made the same mistake.
[204:01.82]I went the wrong way.
[204:02.74]How?
[204:03.26]No, I didn't.
[204:06.76]Get back down here.
[204:10.00]Choke him.
[204:11.73]Get over here.
[204:13.45]I can't be like that was embarrassing.
[204:27.71]Crystal Pepsi?
[204:28.17]That's the LML.
[204:28.66]Stop.
[204:28.82]Save.
[205:04.75]Stop.
[205:06.17]Stop.
[205:07.57]Stop.
[205:10.63]Stop.
[205:14.81]You can't fight me.
[205:16.27]You can't stop me.
[205:17.43]You can't stop the Jedi's.
[205:21.76]I'm not even a Jedi.
[205:28.50]Here we go.
[205:35.64]Wait, I... Bad entrance.
[205:52.85]You know, I wish there was just a punch.
[205:56.29]Okay, here we go.
[206:02.82]Oh my god!
[206:08.46]Is he trying to like block them and just leap?
[206:40.20]How did he do that?
[206:43.16]Don't even matter.
[206:45.88]I'm killing this guy in one hit.
[206:48.54]One earbud Andy.
[206:49.50]Don't matter.
[206:50.24]Unlimited power.
[206:51.90]Go ahead.
[206:52.80]One, two, three.
[207:03.16]I gotta get out of here.
[207:05.56]He's coming.
[207:06.00]He's coming.
[207:06.40]He's coming.
[207:07.14]He's coming.
[207:07.50]Man, you got to get out of the way.
[207:08.40]He's way more powerful than me.
[207:09.48]And if he's way more powerful than me, then we both got to fucking run, man.
[207:15.30]Come get me, Jedi.
[207:31.75]I thought Jedi were powerful.
[207:34.91]We are!
[207:49.93]I thought Jedi were powerful.
[207:51.99]Fuck, are you this- This isn't good.
[207:57.78]I better find this Allura.
[208:01.14]I dunked on.
[208:02.70]I win.
[208:21.51]Get out of the way, fucking abominable snowman.
[208:25.25]Uh-oh, it's the apprentice.
[208:44.83]Not lightning wielding.
[208:46.31]I don't even use that thing.
[208:47.69]I'm also 30.
[208:48.01]Alright, you want to go, motherfucker?
[208:49.35]Ooh, nice job.
[208:49.93]You're dealing with a lightning user.
[208:51.91]Ow!
[209:21.16]Eat that power.
[209:27.66]Oh, shit.
[209:28.00]You do an evil laugh?
[209:28.86]Yeah, I'm kind of evil too.
[209:29.94]I'll pull it.
[209:35.81]I'm the fucking evil one.
[209:36.69]You're not evil.
[209:38.39]I don't want that.
[209:39.69]What if you have any hand?
[209:40.37]I don't want it.
[209:41.47]No, stop giving it to me.
[209:42.65]I don't want it.
[209:43.11]I don't want what you have.
[209:45.91]What do you... I... I don't... What do you want?
[209:50.43]Hey!
[209:52.20]Let's talk.
[209:53.28]You and I should probably... I'm evil too.
[209:56.78]Alright, I'm the fucking evil one in this story.
[209:59.32]Look at all the lightsaber shit all over me.
[210:04.30]No.
[210:12.24]No, you're weak.
[210:13.46]You piece of shit.
[210:16.77]What do you want anyways?
[210:17.55]What do you want with the Empire?
[210:24.74]How about this?
[210:25.83]You're strong.
[210:26.41]I'm strong.
[210:26.99]I know I'm way stronger than you.
[210:30.09]You play dice and see who can win this.
[210:32.01]Maybe we should just team up or something.
[210:43.17]Yeah.
[210:45.96]And I've won every fight I've ever fought.
[210:48.58]How about you?
[210:49.78]How many fights have you won?
[210:52.32]You are weak.
[210:57.30]That's how you win every fight.
[210:59.42]I'm going to get in the dumpster.
[211:01.40]You are a coward.
[211:02.46]Will you come in the dumpster with me?
[211:07.50]Get in here.
[211:09.12]This is where we're going to have our meeting.
[211:12.41]Get in the meeting.
[211:13.03]I want to... Get in here.
[211:19.77]Get in the dumpster.
[211:20.69]We're having a dumpster evil dumpster meeting.
[211:22.47]Please.
[211:22.73]Please.
[211:24.33]Humor me.
[211:25.61]Thank you.
[211:27.13]Okay.
[211:28.21]So.
[211:29.09]First thing.
[211:32.00]Well now.
[211:33.02]Biggest fucking debate in the book.
[211:34.20]Now you're stuck in there.
[211:35.94]Now you gotta listen to me.
[211:44.49]Get it.
[211:50.23]Ooh.
[211:50.41]Extra bounce on that one.
[212:08.03]Oh shit, it's a wall!
[212:14.57]What happened?
[212:19.88]Oh no!
[212:28.16]Everybody just relax.
[212:29.70]I'm pretending to be dead.
[212:32.75]This wasn't going anywhere.
[212:33.77]Just everybody relax.
[212:35.37]When she leaves, I'm going to get up and we can just go to the fridge and get a snack and shit.
[212:38.83]Shh.
[212:43.41]Should I hold my breath?
[212:45.87]I think she'll be able to see my chest moving.
[212:55.68]I have to cough so bad.
[212:56.76]I'm going to sneeze.
[213:00.71]Where is this?
[213:01.48]Is this a bad save?
[213:02.26]Wait, where the fuck is this?
[213:08.66]Where is this?
[213:09.20]Way to go.
[213:31.01]Way to go, Darth Ron.
[213:35.26]Holy shit, this is a horrible save.
[213:36.72]Why do I have it so far back here?
[213:52.00]Load checkpoint.
[213:54.20]He's swinging at me!
[214:07.10]That was stupid.
[214:08.36]That was really dumb.
[214:09.12]I sneeze.
[214:15.80]I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[214:17.20]Remember this part?
[214:19.18]Look out!
[214:21.61]Wait.
[214:22.11]Oh, I didn't mean to... Um... Am I... What the hell just happened?
[214:37.61]Can you... Can I get you to follow me down here?
[214:41.31]What if I bring a giant, like, abominable snowman friend?
[214:54.71]Oh, my... Oh, my God, you made it in.
[214:57.89]Oh, my God, you made it in.
[215:00.14]Oh, my God, you made it in.
[215:09.67]You don't fit.
[215:10.35]Okay.
[215:12.49]What if I put a grenade behind him?
[215:24.16]Whatever.
[215:24.46]Here we go.
[215:27.34]Yep.
[215:27.54]Yep.
[215:27.74]Yep.
[215:27.94]Yep.
[215:28.14]Yep.
[215:28.34]Yep.
[215:28.52]Yep.
[215:28.80]I know.
[215:29.08]I know.
[215:37.71]I don't know how to use one of these things.
[215:43.02]Ice block.
[216:05.44]I have an idea.
[216:06.82]This is just crazy enough to work.
[216:07.82]I'm gonna get her shit stuck in a wall.
[216:10.42]And I'm gonna unload a machine gun into her face.
[216:12.12]So throw that at me.
[216:15.62]Get it stuck in a wall.
[216:18.70]Do I actually kill her?
[216:34.23]It's gotta be the dumpster.
[216:56.95]We'll meet again.
[216:58.62]Welp.
[217:02.50]Two eight-year-olds.
[217:06.08]I can't wait.
[217:09.94]So they know about Dagobah.
[217:11.93]Master Yoda hid there, knowing his presence would be masked by the planet's strong dark side aura.
[217:17.49]If they find it,
[217:23.61]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[217:25.09]Push him in the back as hard as I can out the window.
[217:26.39]Link, Link, Link.
[217:46.13]I sense he's still alive.
[217:47.71]I'm going to Biss to look for him.
[217:49.69]I know some people want to put me into some of the outlying Imperial outposts.
[217:53.99]I'll see what I can find out.
[217:55.45]Very well.
[217:57.29]What about me?
[217:58.38]I want to help.
[217:59.40]Rosh is my friend.
[218:00.80]You can help by staying here and completing your training.
[218:04.06]Kyle's right.
[218:05.04]There are still missions for you to undertake.
[218:07.16]And we can't neglect the training of one of our most promising students.
[218:11.23]Promising?
[218:12.29]Yes.
[218:13.13]Due to your heroics on Hoth, we are promoting you to apprentice.
[218:16.55]Ooh.
[218:18.69]Thank you, Master Skywalker.
[218:20.63]Master, uh, Kyle.
[218:26.07]New style, fast style.
[218:30.35]Ooh, it's a short and quick style.
[218:33.38]Master Skywalker and Master Katarn have left the academy.
[218:36.70]I have been instructed to provide you with a set of possible missions.
[218:41.96]Rescue, meet contact, covert operation, capture the crime lord, or investigate.
[218:47.95]Let me take a look at this link.
[218:53.37]No more reload, Randy.
[218:54.57]Time for Sith Andy.
[218:55.89]A truly powerful Sith Lord never dies.
[218:57.76]To prove your power, 10 million will be added to the debt each time you reload a quicksave.
[219:04.48]What do I get?
[219:14.56]I get nothing.
[219:20.67]No more reload Randy.
[219:21.87]Time for Sith Andy.
[219:25.23]Never dies.
[219:28.91]No deal.
[219:29.47]This is just bad for me.
[219:32.87]That fucking Harry Potter outfit with the lightsaber.
[219:42.38]Like, what the fuck?
[219:46.97]School recess.
[219:49.47]All mushed into one guy in front of the green screen.
[219:54.78]No deal.
[219:58.06]Which one of these is fun?
[220:04.30]From those of you that have played this, which is a good one?
[220:07.76]After the crime lord?
[220:10.35]Covert operation.
[220:14.85]I will do crime lord first.
[220:17.54]We've received anonymous information that a large number of assassin droids have flooded the black market recently.
[220:22.62]These droids have been banned for a number of years and no public companies produce them.
[220:28.00]Lenic Racto, a small-time crime lord on Crusant, is suspected to be manufacturing these droids.
[220:33.70]Capture Racto so that maybe we can interrogate him.
[220:36.29]Hey, Jaden, you should be able to handle this no problem.
[220:39.43]Small-time thugs like Racto are usually very intimidated by the sight of a lightsaber.
[220:50.72]Force choke.
[220:51.20]Did you get heal?
[221:12.43]Did you think you could just barge in here and take me into custody Jedi?
[221:21.41]That's going to cost him a lot of money to fix.
[221:22.93]I feel like there's another way.
[221:25.61]You could have just like hid behind a dresser or something.
[221:46.05]He just hears that while closing the door.
[221:47.59]He's just like, what just happened out there?
[221:51.67]Alright, so just get in the X-Wing, fly, park on the roof of this building.
[221:56.79]I have an X-Wing.
[221:59.10]This should not be a problem for me.
[222:01.36]Just fly and land somewhere else.
[222:13.43]I don't want to even...
[222:22.19]Don't- I didn't agree to that.
[222:23.57]I didn't agree to that.
[222:26.41]You did not- I did not agree to that.
[222:27.83]Where am I supposed to go?
[222:31.66]Too bad.
[222:34.68]No, that's not fair.
[222:38.68]Gain access to the office building.
[222:40.26]Alright, well what the hell am I supposed to do?
[222:53.76]Alright, make the jump in three, two, one jump.
[223:30.38]I have a question for all you Star Wars uh fanatics is lightning is the is lightning just absolute dark side if you learn how to shoot lightning out of your hands you're bad no so when who cares good guys can do it too so why don't good guys do it all the time
[224:04.19]Because it's evil.
[224:07.47]Kit Fisto used a lot of forest lightning.
[224:09.43]Yeah, so what's the problem then?
[224:18.86]It's emotion.
[224:21.82]For me.
[224:26.60]For me, that's right.
[224:31.00]They were just announcing that they were the target practice.
[224:44.07]Oh, can I get a new lightsaber style?
[224:45.59]Yeah, this is it.
[224:50.37]I'm using it right now.
[225:00.52]What are some of the dark side moves?
[225:03.09]What actually quantifies the dark side?
[225:05.95]You've got the lightning, you've got the choke you.
[225:10.65]Choking and lightning.
[225:15.23]Force gaslighting.
[225:18.23]Holy shit, good aim.
[225:23.57]Force drain.
[225:36.16]Where the fuck did you come from?
[225:53.05]Force push.
[225:54.99]No, that's a good guy move.
[225:56.89]I see Anakin does that all the time.
[225:59.77]Obi-Wan does that all the time.
[226:17.61]Real drain.
[226:21.61]Oh, you still alive?
[226:28.65]You know, just.
[226:32.78]Just kill that fucking guy, seriously.
[226:36.10]Alright, from here, there's this guy right here.

[226:53.97]Alright, dead.
[227:06.88]And from here we go.
[227:07.96]I have no idea over there.
[227:14.78]Watch out for the wrist rockets.
[227:17.36]Hey.
[227:19.52]Alright, sometimes you gotta pull like a gun and not just be a coward lightning.
[227:31.61]And then sometimes you put the lightning back in.
[227:36.96]Watch out for wrist rockets.
[227:38.02]Watch out for wrist rockets.
[227:38.82]I don't know why.
[227:48.90]Super battle droid.
[227:49.78]Knock him down.
[227:50.47]That guy went further than anybody ever went.
[228:11.04]Watch those wrist re... Wait, is that like a Mandalorian thing?

[229:18.25]That's so annoying.
[229:21.31]What the hell?
[229:22.89]How is it possible?
[229:24.15]Don't even fight anybody.
[229:25.13]Just get me back to where I was.
[229:28.04]Alright, I'll kill these guys.
[229:40.56]Ooh, that hurt.

[230:27.03]Fuck.
[230:28.21]You guys know what that's like, doing laundry.
[230:30.43]Laundry day.
[230:31.21]It's like six hours.
[230:45.97]Alright, we're almost at the office building.
[230:49.41]Jump!
[230:49.69]Can I fly this?
[230:52.15]This looks flyable, doesn't it?
[230:54.13]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[230:55.43]It looks very, it looks flyable.
[231:13.75]Remember, there's laundry every six months.
[231:16.65]No?
[231:19.05]I'm just saying, when you have a lot of load to do, it takes a while.
[231:24.93]It's not something that just happens in like two minutes.
[231:26.76]I didn't hit these two?
[231:38.26]Jedi Master...
[231:44.33]Jedi.
[231:48.15]How big is... No!

[232:03.59]Alright, keep going.
[232:20.42]Now from here, we go this way.
[232:24.49]Save, save, save.
[232:27.69]He's upset that his move doesn't instantly beat the game for him.
[232:38.07]Not instantly, but speedily.
[232:41.03]I made it.
[232:41.49]Okay, let's go.
[232:42.11]Where is he?
[232:48.34]I don't know who said that, but... Is it you?
[232:51.92]Is that a Jedi?
[232:53.99]Hey!

[234:00.61]Did I seriously get over it?
[234:01.93]How?
[234:02.41]Did you kill me in one swing?
[234:03.49]Are you kidding me?
[234:25.42]Come on.
[234:36.85]You see?
[234:37.11]Here we go.
[234:41.49]I need full health going in here.
[234:52.04]Or at least close to it.
[234:55.56]Full health and full Jedi meter.
[235:01.14]Seriously shooting at me?
[235:10.78]I did not drop the difficulty.
[235:15.33]Waiting for the Jedi meter to charge.
[235:16.89]Here we go.
[235:17.29]No more messing around.
[235:28.71]Yeah.
[235:29.41]Yeah!
[235:30.57]All it took was one.
[235:33.31]What?
[235:38.87]He did- I did not change the difficulty.
[235:40.69]It's the same one it was.
[235:48.46]Show the difficulty.
[235:49.40]I will!
[235:53.31]Look.
[235:54.51]Setup.
[235:58.07]Video.
[235:59.51]Options.
[235:59.95]I don't even know where to show that.
[236:03.12]I can't even show that.
[236:03.92]It's not on easy.
[236:09.72]It's not on easy.
[236:10.90]It's not on easy.
[236:12.02]I swear to God.
[236:13.54]I promise.
[236:23.26]I didn't.
[236:23.68]It's not on easy.
[236:24.28]I promise.
[236:26.04]Next person to accuse me of this is going to get timed out for like, fuck, 10 seconds.
[236:29.95]No.
[236:53.29]It's in his cube.
[236:58.73]And then somebody's shooting at me from outside.
[237:00.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[237:08.04]Get away from me.
[237:08.60]There's one.
[237:13.92]Three diamonds?
[237:14.56]I'll take them.
[237:31.25]Two down!
[237:32.50]Did someone just call me Jerma Andy?
[237:39.48]Did I read that wrong?
[237:50.72]Now, let's talk about these assassin droids.
[237:58.70]Ill.
[237:58.78]What would I do in this scenario?
[238:00.40]I would throw him out the window.
[238:17.26]Nice.
[238:17.62]Uh-oh.
[238:17.98]Alright, covert operation time.
[238:20.00]Sneak around.
[238:20.54]There's something going on on this planet.
[238:23.40]Alright.
[238:23.76]Force Grip 3.
[238:50.17]Sounds pretty good to me.
[239:00.11]So I can hold them and smash them into stuff?
[239:11.94]Show the difficulty.
[239:12.88]I will after this mission.
[239:16.17]Oh this sucks.
[239:16.79]This mission sucks.
[239:17.47]I already know.
[239:18.47]I don't want to play this one.
[239:49.90]How do I get in?
[239:58.63]Wait what?
[240:04.03]Is he shooting at him?
[240:07.89]Wait, I don't understand.
[240:21.56]Get over here.
[240:25.39]Oh my god.
[240:25.81]I can slam their heads into stuff.
[240:27.39]Hold on.
[240:34.29]One sec.
[240:39.34]I promise it's not on easy.
[240:40.64]I think he... Did he... He shot his friend.
[240:48.07]I didn't.
[240:59.78]This guy, what is he doing?
[241:08.44]Did I get him?
[241:33.26]Monster.
[241:33.88]Oh, come on.
[241:36.52]They stole this from Gmod.
[241:37.92]I know.
[242:05.64]Oh, I know.
[242:06.00]I can do this.
[242:07.66]Oh, cool.
[242:07.92]I think it broke his neck.
[242:25.10]Back up or does it go down?
[242:36.45]Wait, do I have to throw these guys?
[242:38.19]Come here!
[242:53.49]Get in here.
[242:56.93]Okay, so you're gonna... No, no, no, no, no, I...
[243:11.63]He's still alive!
[243:12.39]Holy shit!
[243:13.09]Huh?
[243:58.23]I don't think I got off.
[244:08.45]Okay, you got it.
[244:12.49]You can go into the hangar.
[244:15.57]Oh, difficulty now.
[244:16.35]I can't show the difficulty.
[244:17.91]I have to start a new game to show the difficulty.
[244:21.31]You can't change the difficulty.

[283:43.46]I just fell off.
[283:50.22]Down there?
[283:54.82]Where is it?
[284:03.84]Over there.
[284:06.84]Pretending?
[284:07.26]No, I haven't paid a... Guys, I have not paid a single attention to anything that has happened in this entire level because I hate it.
[284:15.42]I hate this level.
[284:16.24]So I've just been going through the motions to just kill things and walk around in circles till somebody says stop.
[284:22.03]Like one of you guys says just... Oh, they're left.
[284:23.79]I go, okay.
[284:41.06]Good for us.
[284:44.50]Hmm.
[285:13.00]What's a good one?
[285:16.64]Probably gonna do one more.
[285:18.63]What's the best one on this list?
[285:28.39]Cult investigation or meet contact.
[285:31.98]Cult, cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.
[285:35.40]People saying this one's good.
[285:36.26]This is a driving level?
[285:41.14]Done.
[285:43.59]Holy shit, it is.
[286:01.89]It's a full letter grade.
[286:14.44]Why did I just do that weird skip?
[286:17.17]That was really bizarre.
[286:29.63]Um, wait, why?
[286:31.51]What's happening?
[286:33.15]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[286:40.57]There were no instructions.
[286:42.57]There was not a single instruction.
[286:46.36]I shook this guy's hand.
[286:47.30]I did like a little frolic onto the motorcycle and... Okay, I'm just... This is really hard to control with a mouse and keyboard.
[287:12.50]Okay, I think we're good.
[287:21.10]Meet at the- meet the contact at his outpost.
[287:25.35]Where's this guy's- where's his outpost?
[287:41.43]Wrong way.
[287:42.29]Use your lightsaber?
[287:51.48]Why am I still alive?
[287:54.13]I'm still alive.
[288:19.98]The Long Drive all over again.
[288:28.20]What?
[288:37.75]Just die.
[288:38.49]Just die.
[288:38.87]Die.
[288:39.25]Die.
[288:56.48]Okay, so where do I go?
[289:02.87]This way?
[289:05.99]You guys stood still.
[289:28.89]It's literally a race track.
[289:34.49]Okay, but... Didn't it say I was going the wrong way when I went this way?
[289:38.13]Yeah, so what the fuck do I do here?
[289:39.21]Do I have to jump through?
[289:39.89]What?
[289:46.88]What?
[289:58.24]Oh my god.
[289:59.68]Oh my god, what happened?
[290:03.00]Jump through it?
[290:03.92]I don't know what you mean.
[290:07.89]How do I jump with this?
[290:13.65]Oh, you mean like actually jump just me?
[290:27.68]What the hell?
[290:28.26]That's not fun.
[290:28.84]Is that Luke?
[290:38.87]Yeah, I ran into some trouble.
[290:39.97]I really fucked up a few times.
[291:05.46]OK, so so far so good.
[291:09.74]I want the purple one.
[291:16.65]Give me give me any of them.
[291:26.12]Can't get on it.
[291:26.96]Get on the bike, dude.
[291:28.30]Get on the bike.
[291:29.84]Get... I hit the gas.
[291:45.61]I pressed the gas way too hard.
[291:48.39]If you go in a go-kart, and you press down on the gas pedal way too hard, and you go fucking flying...
[292:06.54]Mage with flash.
[292:13.69]I just did something.
[292:14.65]What did I just do?
[292:16.95]Oh.
[292:48.85]Get me out of here.
[292:51.59]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[292:52.91]Give me the bike back.
[292:53.55]Give me that bike.
[293:32.12]Jump off.
[293:42.58]Oh, shit.
[293:43.04]Go, go, go, go, go.
[293:47.45]Alright.
[294:01.78]I didn't even... Hey, he's coming kind of right for me.
[294:05.08]He's kind of... What's happening?
[294:24.79]What is he doing?
[294:36.33]This dude, what's going on?
[294:47.22]He's like, alright, man.
[294:48.36]Alright, you win.
[294:52.12]Did he put a grenade down?
[294:53.31]I don't even know.
[294:54.09]No, get...
[295:07.14]I'm gonna pass out.
[295:07.88]I have to hold on.
[295:10.86]Hold on.
[295:11.18]I'm gonna like pass out if I don't fucking stop.
[295:19.45]The guy behind me.
[295:21.49]He went very far by the way.
[295:24.89]This is so hard to control with the mouse.
[295:38.91]Okay, so should I go over there?
[295:45.67]Spam D on your keyboard.
[295:48.37]I'm not gonna do that.
[295:56.13]Where are the enemies?
[295:58.52]Oh, here they come.
[296:00.20]Stop!
[296:00.52]Okay.
[296:03.64]It's a tiny hole to go in.
[296:07.80]Thank goodness.
[296:15.05]Cool.
[296:15.21]Alright.
[296:15.75]Keep going.
[296:17.75]I don't know what is doing, but it was just dragging me around like crazy.
[296:24.54]I do not feel very much in control right now at all.
[296:40.87]What is going on?
[296:45.31]What is going on?
[296:46.27]Wait, did I just do this?
[296:57.41]Um... I had no control of what was just going on at all.
[297:17.51]Get away from me.
[297:21.77]What am I- Why am I watching?
[297:23.55]What?
[297:25.65]Why did I need to see that?
[297:35.20]I'm in the- I can't move.
[297:39.47]Get the fuck off the wall.
[297:45.65]Why are they all doing this?
[297:48.43]Turn.
[297:48.97]Up this way?
[297:57.03]Oh my fucking god.
[297:58.59]Where?
[297:58.85]Get off.
[298:00.64]Get off.
[298:01.34]Get off.
[298:01.56]Get off.
[298:01.80]Get off.
[298:02.00]Get off.
[298:02.22]Get off.
[298:13.61]I can't control the motorcycle.
[298:14.79]It just flies the fuck out of the way.
[298:16.73]I can't do anything.
[298:18.87]Do I even get on it?
[298:26.38]Stop boosting.
[298:27.06]I didn't even boost.
[298:28.86]It just threw me up there.
[298:29.92]I boosted there because I had to.
[298:38.42]Wait, why...
[298:40.66]You turn with the mouse?
[298:41.54]Yeah, it's like dog shit.
[298:59.19]It's so hard.
[299:01.09]It's so hard.
[299:02.11]It's so annoying to control.
[299:07.45]I can't.
[299:08.15]I... My fucking god, I just fell out of the sky.
[299:12.21]Like, I fell out of the goddamn sky.
[299:14.29]I think I have- I don't have to nosebleed?
[299:16.93]No.
[299:25.76]Did I just go in this building?
[299:27.76]I don't even know what way is the right way anymore.
[299:30.10]What's the correct way?
[299:32.00]Just in the building.
[299:37.71]Okay, five people just died.
[299:51.87]Did I do it?
[300:20.29]Don't strafe.
[300:25.05]I'm not doing that.
[300:26.87]I'm telling you right now, I'm not doing that.
[300:34.40]Okay, I made it.
[300:36.38]By going... Escape from the mercenaries and make your way to the far city gate.
[300:55.79]Save it.
[301:04.53]I think I'm getting close, I think.
[301:05.81]I have no idea what just happened.
[301:15.56]Is this it?
[301:19.35]Why do I feel like I used turbo to jump the chasm?
[301:27.94]It didn't make it.
[301:28.92]Now... This way.
[301:58.03]Got him.
[302:02.03]Give me your fucking bike right now.
[302:48.24]oh my fucking god dude why give me one of your bikes right now before I freak out they just squished me they squished my heads together like two
[303:10.17]Get!
[303:13.65]Leave me alone!
[303:20.23]Give me that bike.
[303:21.21]His bike is in better condition than mine.
[303:22.51]It just fucking exploded.
[303:31.38]There's the gate!
[303:32.82]I made it to the gate!
[303:44.99]Thank God.
[303:45.49]Oh, thank goodness.
[303:46.28]I don't care about that.
[303:47.92]Just tell me what to do.
[303:49.02]What time is it?
[303:49.78]I'll do one more.
[303:50.32]I'll be the boss.
[303:52.20]We'll do the next two missions.
[303:53.38]Hmm.
[304:15.53]Don't engage members of the cult.
[304:16.67]Every time I don't engage.
[304:17.57]Don't engage them.
[304:18.87]Ahem.
[304:43.56]Drop your laser sword, Jedi, and maybe we'll spare your life.
[304:50.93]Or perhaps you'd like to take your chances.
[304:54.79]Okay.
[305:00.16]Well, they can't take my lightning powers away from me.
[305:01.94]So, my Jedi friend, what do you think of our accommodations?
[305:08.29]Well, why don't you come down here and find out?
[305:10.41]Ah, feisty.
[305:13.21]Well, I got caught so I could get inside without a problem.
[305:15.59]Okay, I get it.
[305:16.05]I have a proposition for you.
[305:18.01]You see, it can get dreadfully dull around here, so I'm up for a bit of sport.
[305:24.99]I'm going to let you out.
[305:27.17]If you can make it back to your ship, you're free to leave.
[305:31.57]But if I catch you, I'll have to shoot you.
[305:36.73]That guy a Jedi?
[306:07.17]Okay.
[306:07.31]Let me out.
[306:11.81]He's going to let me out.
[306:12.49]Okay.
[306:15.37]Are there other people in the cells?
[306:16.65]Can I let them out too?
[306:24.06]He gave me a weapon too.
[306:24.96]I don't even need it.
[306:26.36]I got out.
[306:36.88]I don't have a lightsaber.
[306:40.10]The guy didn't even have a chance to load his gun.
[307:08.16]Oh, third person.
[307:11.74]Helpful.
[307:16.55]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[307:18.41]That guy just got hit by his... That was awesome.
[307:20.41]I loved it.
[307:21.65]Absolutely loved it.
[307:22.67]This thing shoots fast.
[307:39.72]Which door?
[307:40.16]How about this one?
[307:43.14]That's the one.
[307:55.77]P!
[308:01.37]Open the doors for all the cells.
[308:03.05]Let all the prisoners out and let them come out.
[308:08.28]I need to pee.
[308:10.62]I can't pause.
[308:16.33]Trying to do the next mission or two.
[308:32.46]Fire hose.
[308:43.00]Alright, let's go.
[308:50.69]I'm crying.
[308:53.21]Please give us a pause.
[308:55.61]We'll pause after this.
[308:58.22]Oh, shit.
[308:58.46]Hold on.
[309:00.82]Pause.
[309:01.28]Alright.
[309:01.56]Alright.
[309:01.78]Alright.
[309:02.00]Alright.
[309:02.40]You want to take a break?
[309:02.94]Alright.
[309:04.96]Break time.
[309:06.20]Last break.
[309:06.82]We'll do this mission and the one after, and then I'm going to call him tonight.
[309:09.83]Be right back.
[310:24.25]Thank you.
[311:12.97]Alright, I'm back.
[311:35.83]Get back to it.
[311:44.89]And I was just going in this door.
[311:46.45]Okay, thank God I fat fingered right in the exact same spot I just was.
[311:52.72]Where should I go?
[312:07.18]Go!
[312:14.05]Where did this guy come from?
[312:32.20]What?
[312:34.04]Jerry voice?
[312:35.20]Jerry!
[312:36.52]Ah, Jerry!
[312:38.15]It actually kind of is.
[312:39.01]That's stupid.
[312:48.02]Jerry!
[312:48.44]Oh, Jerry!
[313:10.47]Where am I going?
[313:11.23]Every door is the same door.
[313:27.34]Gain access to the docking bay.
[313:31.82]What?
[313:44.24]Too many fucking doors opening.
[313:48.00]Use the force.
[313:49.16]Yes.
[313:51.79]I will.
[313:52.99]I promise I'll use the force.
[313:58.39]Like a shotgun.
[314:03.97]This way.
[314:04.41]Um.
[314:06.62]Man, I wish I had a map.
[314:14.09]Is this it?
[314:26.06]Is this it?
[314:36.83]Is it?
[314:38.57]No, this is the very beginning!
[314:42.58]Oh, God damn it.
[314:43.84]This is the beginning of the game.
[314:58.34]But all these hallways, there's like 50 doors in here.
[315:09.81]There's too many doors.
[315:14.16]Too many doors.
[315:14.76]Too many elevators.
[315:21.82]They got too many elevators, too many doors, and too many rooms that lead to nowhere.
[315:25.76]A door intended to go to another door.
[315:28.04]I don't even know what this is. ...
[315:44.96]What does that do?
[315:48.92]I had to do that?
[315:49.78]Oh boy.
[316:17.85]I just took down an AT-ST by myself.
[316:20.11]And a guy's gonna come out of the... The guy's gonna come out of the roof.
[316:22.67]And I'm gonna headshot him.
[316:31.14]He's dead.
[316:32.40]Well... Oh well.
[316:41.48]Where'd he go now?
[316:46.08]Um...
[316:50.13]Can I get that one?
[316:54.79]Are we...
[317:19.33]singed my eyebrows.
[317:20.35]Wait.
[317:20.99]This door is opened elsewhere.
[317:22.34]Shit.
[317:23.08]Hold on.
[317:23.34]Did I just kill the guy through the wall and now he has to open the door?
[317:26.08]Uh-oh.
[317:29.98]Wait.
[317:31.80]Oh, okay.
[317:36.77]Open up that one.
[317:39.53]No, I'm not soft locked.
[317:40.81]Okay.
[317:49.90]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[317:52.06]Door to get to a door.
[317:53.32]Yep.
[317:58.60]Uh-huh.
[318:04.51]Oh, no.
[318:07.75]Oh, there he is.
[318:08.11]This Doom guy.
[318:10.10]15, 20 years later.
[318:41.22]Remember, get in the fucking AT-ST.
[318:43.97]I can't- You can't get in an AT-ST.
[318:53.01]Yes, you can.
[318:53.63]Yes, you can.
[318:54.21]Yes, you can.
[318:54.86]Yes, you can.
[318:55.48]Yes, you can.
[318:56.12]Yes, you can.
[318:56.94]That's too late.
[318:59.10]I don't need an AT-ST.
[319:00.10]I have me.
[319:00.54]And I have powerful, powerful- I'm gonna sneeze.
[319:03.86]Yes!
[319:11.30]I couldn't mute.
[319:12.18]I tried so hard.
[319:15.80]I fucking... I couldn't do it.
[319:20.96]I'm so sorry.
[319:23.40]I can't.
[319:24.46]I lied.

[319:26.38]I lied.
[319:26.84]I'm a liar.
[319:27.76]I'm lying.
[319:28.36]I lied.
[319:28.80]I tried to capture it and I got it.
[319:40.65]It sounds like a dog sneeze.
[319:43.41]It's a dog sneeze.
[319:50.21]It sounds like a dog sneeze.
[319:54.32]Where is this saved?

[321:47.86]This looks like a boss fight.
[322:16.42]It is.
[322:23.93]Well played.

[324:01.29]Whoa!
[324:17.66]I'm gonna fall off.
[324:26.67]What the fuck?
[324:27.39]The whole screen shakes.
[324:53.25]ah whoa easy easy don't kill me
[325:11.15]I just stepped on his head.
[325:12.41]Why did that work more effectively than force lightning?
[325:22.52]Oh my fucking god.
[325:25.98]Shoot him.
[325:26.38]I...
[325:49.17]Nice, Rod.
[325:53.63]Oh no, I did it again.
[325:54.73]I did it again.
[325:58.59]No, no, no, it doesn't count.
[325:59.73]It doesn't count.
[326:00.59]It doesn't count.
[326:01.99]It doesn't count.
[326:03.00]It doesn't count.
[326:03.52]I had to do the... What?
[326:05.06]Seems I underestimated you.
[326:09.08]That doesn't include the sneeze and the- Got him.
[326:20.20]Too bad Rax didn't have any useful info.
[326:22.59]I'm proud of how you handled yourself, Jaden.
[326:24.77]Well done.
[326:26.27]Luke's coming up with a plan for tracking down the disciples of Ragnos, but it may take some time.
[326:31.73]If you want, you can take one more mission.
[326:33.89]Otherwise, meet us in the audience chamber.
[326:36.27]Kyle and I have sensed great anger in you, Jaden.
[326:38.75]You must learn to control it, or it could lead you to the dark side.
[326:44.11]You sense anger in me?
[326:44.99]Better be careful.
[326:49.71]The disciples of Ragnos are getting bold.
[326:52.01]They've managed to siphon Force energy from every site that was mentioned in my journal.
[326:56.43]We still don't know what it is they're planning to do with the energy, though.
[327:02.36]It's imperative that we track down the leader of this cult.
[327:06.17]But how?
[327:07.13]If they've already hit every place in your journal?
[327:09.96]There are several places I didn't mention by name that they've discovered, like Dagobah.
[327:14.36]My fear is that they may use clues in my journals to discover other places.
[327:18.90]We need to beat them to these locations.
[327:21.19]Considering how we... lost a student last time...
[327:24.87]We must be very cautious.
[327:27.03]Everyone will travel in pairs.
[327:28.87]Kyle, Jaden, you'll be going to Vajoon.
[327:31.57]Vajoon?
[327:32.63]Isn't that just a big dead rock?
[327:34.46]It also happens to be the location of one of my father's strongholds.
[327:37.92]You don't add a billion to the debt because I said nice.
[327:41.30]Rick?
[327:42.14]This ought to be interesting.
[327:45.40]I'd heard rumors that Luke had been to Vajoon, but he never really talked about it.
[327:50.58]But June is dangerous.
[327:52.14]The dark side is strong there.
[327:53.78]Oppressive.
[327:55.08]Be extremely careful.
[327:56.74]Sure, Luke.
[327:57.72]Don't worry.
[328:02.76]Alright.
[328:04.32]Time to be careful.
[328:05.14]Heavy forces.
[328:14.00]What?
[328:24.87]Is Darth Vader in this game?
[328:25.75]Is Darth Vader in this game?
[328:29.29]Is Darth Vader in this game?
[328:30.97]Testing my compressor.
[328:31.84]It's acid rain?
[328:32.34]Am I saying ooh?
[328:54.79]Nice dude nice.
[328:55.33]What's his name Kyle?
[328:57.57]Nice Kyle
[329:23.66]God.
[329:24.78]Oh, God.
[329:25.57]Ah-ha-ee-ooh.
[329:25.83]Is he doing that?
[329:26.45]Ooh.
[329:26.57]Ooh.
[329:26.65]Ooh.
[329:26.81]Ooh.
[329:27.27]Ah.
[329:55.89]Ah!
[329:56.31]E!
[329:56.87]Ooh!
[329:57.19]What the fuck?
[329:58.49]Oh my god, it's ruined.
[329:59.69]Coming back.
[330:33.74]Let's go.
[330:34.08]You can't just run in.
[330:59.08]You cannot just run in.
[331:04.49]This level sucks.
[331:30.46]Do something!
[331:33.14]There it is!
[331:34.42]Save it!
[331:36.10]Go!
[332:15.92]None of them are yours.
[332:20.03]They're all mine.
[332:23.07]None of us are free.
[332:25.07]We are men of the night, SWAT.
[332:33.72]I need help down here.
[332:34.46]There's a Jedi.
[332:48.31]Nice job.
[332:51.19]You did it.
[332:54.69]Excellent work.
[332:59.17]If he can get away, nope.
[333:00.39]Nobody left alive.
[333:04.35]I don't know who you guys are.
[333:06.49]No one left alive.
[333:09.31]The true way of the Sith.
[333:18.53]Very well.
[333:36.86]Obtained golden arms.
[333:40.62]You're joking, right?
[333:41.99]Okay.
[333:45.65]Uh, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[333:50.73]Kill, kill.
[333:55.29]Nice.
[334:01.07]Checkpoint.
[334:04.19]Oh, I thought I could hit with a door.
[334:13.00]Wait.
[334:16.42]Can't wait until Darth Vader shows up.
[334:19.38]Shield recharge machine.
[334:20.98]Oh my God.
[334:22.18]I got it.
[334:23.06]I'm right here.
[334:36.55]Where they at?
[334:40.01]Two Jedi's walking in.
[334:43.33]This lightsaber is weird.
[334:45.81]It's like thin and blue.
[334:47.51]It's not like a regular lightsaber.
[334:52.33]There's a point in the end.
[334:54.32]Oh shit, look out!
[335:10.75]You going this way?
[335:11.45]Nope.
[335:11.69]Stopping in front of the width of his saber.
[335:21.37]Alright.
[335:24.63]Oh.
[335:41.04]Shield booster.
[335:43.22]Oh, boy.
[335:43.78]Watch out.

[339:37.68]You're dealing with a real Sith Lord, but I'm a good guy.
[339:47.33]Oh, fuck.

[340:11.48]Nice job, man.

[340:31.67]Sliced him.
[340:35.87]Nice one, James!
[340:47.22]I missed two times.
[340:47.90]That means you get to live.
[340:53.82]Let's see who's behind it all.
[341:00.90]That's the wizard behind the fucking Wizard of Oz.
[341:05.68]He just scared me.
[341:08.62]Don't ever come up behind a Jedi when he's in the middle of a fight.
[341:16.79]Okay, the turbo laser should be on the other side of this door.
[341:22.17]Up.
[341:22.23]Did you change clothes?
[341:24.26]Alright.
[341:51.47]Okay, alright.
[341:53.49]Guess who can do that too?
[341:55.24]I can do that too!

[342:02.04]Yeah, I'm a Sith too, motherfucker.
[342:03.57]You wanna see who's stronger?
[342:04.49]Who can choke each other's fucking neck harder?
[342:07.29]Put the lightsabers down.
[342:09.03]Let's do it our way.
[342:22.10]God, give me your best.

[343:59.02]It's good to get out of that rain.
[344:00.40]Now we need to get up into the castle.
[344:02.90]There's a turbo lift over there.
[344:04.70]Oh, turbo.
[344:05.16]I didn't think of a turbo.
[344:07.02]There's a turbo blaster.
[344:08.00]There's a turbo lift.
[344:08.94]There's a turbo.
[344:10.77]Turbo graphics.
[344:11.61]We got... What do we got, Obi-Wan?
[344:12.37]Turbo.
[344:12.57]Turbo.
[344:36.72]Of course, it has to be a garbage pit, doesn't it?
[344:40.30]Well, let's go.
[344:41.22]No one ever said being a Jedi was glamorous.
[344:43.86]Actually, a lot of people did.
[344:44.60]It's like a dream of every child.
[344:47.84]It's the thing that everybody wants to do.
[344:51.08]It's like being a superhero.
[344:53.32]Everyone loves it.
[344:58.36]In fact, it's one of the most glamorous jobs I think in the galaxy.
[345:05.22]Everybody knows you, everybody respects you, everybody like loves you.
[345:07.62]What are you talking about?
[345:14.36]How'd you do that?
[345:33.42]What are you guys doing out in the trash?
[345:36.18]Did I do it?
[345:48.01]Is it activating?
[345:52.70]Why is there a huge trash base?
[346:14.35]Holy shit, they all freaked out.
[346:16.85]They freaked out when I put the grenades.
[346:28.13]It puts him into a panic.
[346:31.27]He's in the vent.
[346:36.07]He's looking up.
[346:36.71]He doesn't care about this guy.
[346:37.86]He just cares about the guy in the vent.
[346:42.10]He's trying to get up there.
[346:48.05]Hmm.
[346:48.29]I can get up there.
[346:48.97]Maybe.
[346:49.11]Maybe.
[346:49.51]I think I can do it.
[346:53.03]Can you?
[346:53.45]Maybe he can.
[346:57.13]Come on.
[346:57.59]Do it.
[347:01.00]Oh.
[347:02.52]He has changed his target.
[347:13.82]Oh, I shot him!
[347:17.28]Oh, what is this guy doing up there?
[347:18.96]We gotta... Alright, we gotta kill this guy.
[347:20.64]Grenade?
[347:22.78]Alright, I'm gonna throw... Alright, he's gonna freak the fuck out in here.
[347:25.60]I don't have any more grenades.
[347:29.08]Hold on.
[347:35.60]I wish I had grenades.
[347:39.99]He's literally just spawn camping in here.
[347:42.62]Like you're just camping.
[347:48.20]You think you can take me?
[347:49.76]Just leave him up here.
[347:55.76]Got him.
[348:07.24]Nice job, uh, Obi-Wan Kyle.
[348:11.02]Kyle Obi.
[348:15.90]You get up this?
[348:34.61]Um, is that wrong?
[348:40.50]Oh shit.
[348:41.16]Where'd he go?
[348:49.79]I went in a circle.
[348:50.57]Yeah, but... What's the correct way to go though?
[349:00.22]Alright, where'd we go?
[349:18.03]Switch?
[349:20.01]I think this door would open.
[349:27.34]Go up?
[349:29.84]I did go up, right?
[349:41.96]I just did this, didn't I?
[349:45.38]I just did this.
[349:53.62]I just did this, so no.
[349:58.67]Then do it again.
[349:59.67]OK.
[350:13.25]I. I guess that that made no sense.
[350:19.90]John Cena is killed thanks to the 20 community subs, John.

[351:03.60]Turn the pow- Find a way to turn off the power.

[352:39.43]Why can I not take my lightsaber out?
[352:44.65]The battery's dead.
[352:47.00]Oh my god.

[358:14.89]Did you hear the splat?
[358:16.57]That was a cartoon splat.

[358:25.54]Huh.
[358:41.21]Imperials!
[358:51.68]Oh no, a fight chamber.
[359:01.25]The mouse is coming for you.
[359:04.08]I'm playing a video game.
[359:05.22]I'm not streaming the movie.
[359:07.80]It's okay.
[359:08.37]It's allowed.
[359:17.91]Now what?
[359:22.93]Why do people like this dumb Star Wars shit?
[359:26.16]Are you new here?
[359:27.56]Yes.
[359:28.48]You were a wise choice.
[359:33.27]Two on one.
[359:34.27]Wait, I'm the boss.
[359:47.29]You idiot.
[359:50.69]Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[359:53.13]Oh, he almost just killed him.
[359:59.56]Now this is one person controlling two people at the same time with a controller and the keyboard.
[360:05.16]Doing pretty well considering.
[360:21.49]Lots of Sith Lords.
[360:33.24]Oh, that's another thing I have to ask.
[360:35.02]Do we have a Jedi Academy?
[360:36.32]Is this... I'm seeing a lot of red lightsabers.
[360:41.39]Do they have like a Sith Lord Academy?
[360:42.89]Because there's a lot of these little Sith henchmen.
[360:50.21]Do they?
[360:59.95]Oh shit.
[361:00.71]Okay, that was pretty nice.
[361:03.71]You're not supposed to ask that question.
[361:22.98]Well, I just did.
[361:25.91]Yellow means you're a sentinel.
[361:28.34]Cool.
[361:35.49]Let's see how good you are.
[361:38.45]Let go.
[361:45.78]Powering up.
[361:46.24]Are you serious?
[361:48.82]You dishonorable.
[361:50.72]Completely out of the fucking goddamn question that you would do something like that.
[361:54.72]Unbelievable.
[361:55.86]Demote this guy.
[361:56.78]Get rid of him.
[361:57.26]You're going to shoot a guy in the back in the middle of a 1v1 lightsaber Sith versus Jedi battle.
[362:03.30]Are you proud of yourself?
[362:06.95]No honor at all.
[362:09.07]Oh yeah, you are.
[362:10.03]Yes, nodding.
[362:10.99]Very good.
[362:11.75]Very good.
[362:12.47]I'm going to torture this motherfucker when I get over there.
[362:30.09]Karen.
[362:31.79]Oh, yes, you are nodding.
[362:32.87]Yeah, go ahead and film me.
[362:35.64]Well, I'm filming you too.
[362:39.78]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[362:41.10]Oh my God, like only.
[362:45.72]Stop that.
[362:51.29]I'm using the powers of light.
[363:05.33]I will use the powers of light to destroy you.
[363:21.95]It's creeper blocks, be careful.
[363:55.70]Oh shit.
[363:59.28]Let me go!
[364:00.18]Let me go!
[364:32.47]Shock him.
[364:32.97]Shock him.
[364:33.37]Shock him.
[364:33.77]Shock him.
[364:34.19]Shock him.
[364:36.85]Give that back.
[364:45.54]Through the wall.
[364:46.18]You can do that through the wall.
[364:46.98]No, you can't.
[364:47.72]Lie.
[364:53.51]There it is.
[364:54.01]Got it.
[364:54.57]1v1 duel.
[364:54.93]You're dead.
[364:59.74]Give him the jock jock shock jocking.
[365:01.44]Oh shit, there's another... Bye.
[365:02.86]Where's that Sith Jedi?
[365:06.19]Where'd he go?
[365:49.29]Big mistake letting go of your blade like that.
[365:51.67]What an idiot.
[365:53.56]Completely opening yourself up to an attack.
[366:04.30]Why is chat rioting?
[366:05.00]What do you mean?
[366:10.68]No, I'm leaving.
[366:19.01]Yeah, you come get me.
[366:34.51]Oh shit, this is a bad idea.
[366:42.78]Where is my friend?
[366:44.40]I have to fight three of these guys at the same time?
[366:46.80]This is unfair.
[366:49.14]Really unfair.
[366:49.86]Oh, I can hide over here.
[367:10.07]They have trouble in tight spaces.
[367:11.45]Oh my god.
[367:17.64]I don't even know what's happening.
[367:23.10]They're not powerful?
[367:23.98]You don't think I'm fighting four of you guys at the same time?
[367:26.80]And a choker guy.
[367:30.08]And a flying mech suit.
[367:34.01]I think I'm pretty powerful.
[367:35.61]I think I'm very powerful actually.
[367:50.68]Oh my god, die.
[368:01.89]Holy shit, he's got lightning too.
[368:03.57]Nice.
[368:04.67]Mine's blue.
[368:05.25]That means mine's good.
[368:10.82]Hold on, hold on.
[368:11.76]Wait, get out of here.
[368:12.72]I'm busy right now.
[368:33.60]Okay.
[368:41.81]Jesus.
[368:42.31]Alright.
[368:42.79]So what did he say?
[368:43.53]You're going to catch up to me soon?
[368:44.59]Doing what?
[369:02.07]Where is he?
[369:05.27]He's gonna just come in on a giant fucking ship, isn't he?
[369:24.09]This level is way too long, by the way.
[369:27.93]It's like extended level.
[369:36.83]What does he want me to do?
[369:40.30]Back up there?
[369:40.82]Go up?
[369:58.22]What?
[370:02.04]Oh, that blends in with the... That blends in.
[370:04.10]That blends in.
[370:09.40]I don't even care about that guy.
[370:11.79]I don't even want to fight him.
[370:12.91]I don't care.
[370:20.61]Alright, this is the big climax right here.
[370:22.45]This is it.
[370:48.00]What's wrong with my game?
[370:48.76]What's wrong with the game?
[370:51.94]What's wrong with my game?
[370:52.72]I just got stretched.
[371:05.64]I got drugged by the droid.
[371:07.04]Oh, okay.
[371:17.29]Yep.
[371:27.45]Oh, I hate that.
[371:28.69]I hate it.
[371:29.10]I hate it.
[371:29.42]I hate it.
[371:29.70]I hate it.
[371:29.96]I hate it.
[371:30.24]I hate it.
[371:30.48]I hate it.
[371:30.72]I hate it.
[371:37.54]I'm hungry.
[371:40.89]That run.
[371:42.55]Oh, damn it.
[371:43.43]That fucking run freaked me out, man.
[371:53.26]What the chip?
[371:57.98]Time for a Whopper?
[371:58.84]No, thank you.
[372:01.60]Rather... Never mind.
[372:03.15]It's like... This thing... I hate this stupid fucking shield.
[372:08.65]Ah!
[372:30.91]Eat lead.
[372:35.28]Oh.
[372:37.42]Wait, what?
[372:38.16]They have lightsabers now?
[372:39.70]Since when do they have lightsabers?
[372:44.09]Oh, they did once.
[372:59.23]They fly now?
[373:00.25]What's that from?
[373:09.34]You know, they keep playing the Darth Vader song, but he's not in the game.
[373:24.36]An intruder.
[373:30.19]Bye.
[373:32.27]I don't want to do that right now.
[373:43.37]Oh, it's a double wielding lightsaber foe.
[374:00.10]Oh, I thought I was gonna get right in the middle.
[374:06.27]What the fuck is this?
[374:07.17]Is he gonna be screaming?
[374:13.83]Okay, run.
[374:16.56]There's a lot of trash.
[374:17.58]Holy shit, you have tons of trash.
[374:30.48]Yeah, try to block all those.
[374:39.21]Ooh, what a one-liner.
[374:46.39]Here comes Darth Vader.
[375:01.33]It's pretty like Doom.
[375:02.31]May the force be with you.
[375:12.90]What?
[375:13.74]Oh, what?
[375:33.56]Did they, like, phone a friend or something?
[375:35.18]How did you... Oh, come down here.
[375:38.94]Was he supposed to be here the whole time?
[375:40.82]Was he supposed to be here the entire time?
[375:52.37]Dumb one didn't like Vader much.
[375:56.18]Wait.
[376:00.40]Is that Kyle?
[376:02.18]That's not Kyle.
[376:08.90]He just felled off.
[376:12.86]What did you do?
[376:13.68]How did he fall?
[376:23.19]How did he fall?
[376:26.81]I can't.
[376:33.78]He slipped on something.
[376:35.12]I mean, it just... How?
[376:44.21]I win.
[376:44.71]Did you just hear?
[377:07.09]I sense you, Jedi.
[377:24.53]Alright, I'm going to shoot a fake one.
[377:38.65]Here's the real one.
[377:53.46]Oh, wow.
[377:59.04]God damn it.
[377:59.67]I'm sticking on the wall.
[378:01.59]This is a fucking mistake.
[378:10.17]Alright, now why don't you come over here and get me, you fucking punk?
[378:16.04]Oh, look at this.
[378:16.96]Come and get me.
[378:29.59]Stronger?
[378:31.34]No.
[378:33.12]Smarter?
[378:33.44]Maybe.
[378:33.72]Pretty good.
[378:45.12]Never take your blade down.
[378:47.42]People always do that and it's the stupidest idea.
[378:49.58]You just look silly.
[378:51.58]How many times are they going to do that?
[379:20.80]DMCA sounds.
[379:22.08]Ooh, this one has the Darth Maul.
[379:33.49]Ooh.
[379:48.81]Garth Malding.
[379:53.71]What?
[379:53.89]Did I win?
[379:54.29]Okay, I got him.
[380:15.02]Oh shit, this is like the Chancellor.
[380:17.03]The Emperor.
[380:26.47]I sense your presence, Jaden.
[380:28.59]Yeah, of course he was bad.
[380:29.75]Rosh, what are you doing here?
[380:31.79]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Underground.
[380:33.19]Samples of Ragnos brought me.
[380:35.53]At first, I thought they were going to kill me.
[380:38.29]But I was wrong about them.
[380:39.54]Do you realize how much power there is in the dark side?
[380:44.24]Kyle was holding us back, Jaden.
[380:46.64]You should feel the power.
[380:48.80]It's beyond anything you've ever imagined.
[380:52.05]Rosh, what are you saying?
[380:54.09]You're a Jedi.
[380:57.28]Yeah, I think I know what it's like.
[381:02.72]I'm also Darkseid.
[381:04.24]Red.
[381:04.76]Oh no, it's red.
[381:05.70]Oh no, it's red.
[381:33.94]Wait, what happened to the first guy?
[381:43.36]They had their back facing me.
[381:50.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[382:11.38]show you
[382:35.21]He's just up there He's gonna fall he's gonna fall he's gonna Fall Guys.
[382:40.77]He's gonna fall we're gonna all laugh at it.
[382:43.00]He's gonna fall Get down from there come on
[382:53.05]Fall already.
[382:59.75]He ain't gonna fall.
[383:00.59]Fall already.
[383:01.55]Will you just fall down already?
[383:13.22]I knew it was coming.
[383:13.98]It was still funny.
[383:20.32]What did he hit his head on?
[383:24.64]He even laid out for that.
[383:26.32]He didn't even lay out that far.
[383:28.14]At least try to land on your knees and roll, man.
[383:32.32]You just went completely belly flop on your stomach.
[383:36.39]At least give yourself the opportunity to not, like, cave in your chest.
[383:45.81]Why is he blue?
[383:48.55]I can't.
[383:50.39]Ugh.
[383:59.93]It's a hologram.
[384:07.44]Take this.
[384:13.50]Oh, he's green now.
[384:14.16]That means I have force power.
[384:34.21]Shit.
[384:35.87]Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.
[384:38.83]Get away.
[384:39.29]Get the fuck away from me.
[384:40.21]Get away, mom.
[384:44.93]Oh.
[384:50.11]Oh my fucking God.
[384:50.99]Don't let him kill you.
[384:51.79]He's shitty.
[384:53.03]He's horrible.
[384:53.57]He's like the little pretend antagonist.
[384:57.75]You are weak.
[385:01.90]Alright.
[385:07.17]Ow ow ow ow.
[385:28.74]Fuck, I was trying to be dishonorable.
[386:11.73]This guy's fucking running.
[386:14.65]These guys don't even have any... Where's Rash?
[386:45.08]I'm going to wait till it's 100 and then do it.
[386:52.64]Diaper rash.
[386:55.50]Alright, back up, back up, back up.
[387:02.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[387:13.63]And big head tennis.
[387:16.47]That's what you're looking for.
[387:18.77]You're looking for big head tennis.
[387:29.24]I don't know where it was.
[387:36.42]Here it is.
[387:41.23]Kyle, I... Oh.
[387:45.75]Did you really think I would give up my new apprentice so easily?
[387:49.69]You standing there the whole time?
[387:50.71]You should have killed me when you had the chance, Katarn.
[387:53.96]Your pathetic Jedi mercy is a weakness that shall cost you your life.
[387:59.30]And the life of your academy's students.
[388:03.82]But not you, my dear Rosh.
[388:07.49]Come.
[388:08.51]Yes, Tavion.
[388:10.03]Rosh, no!
[388:13.92]I know.
[388:14.86]I'm incredibly strong in the dark side.
[388:16.51]I got much better lightning hands than anybody in this room.
[388:18.71]Please.
[388:36.56]It's quite the drop.
[388:37.24]It's quite the fumble.
[389:07.11]I don't even know what just happened.
[389:20.26]We looked everywhere after getting free, but Tavion had already taken Rosh and fled.
[389:25.08]So now we know who was leading this cult, but that doesn't explain why there are so many dark force users.
[389:31.29]A lot wrong with what just happened there, I think.
[389:33.81]As for the cultists, Jaden has a theory.
[389:36.49]If the scepter can store the force, maybe it can release it too.
[389:40.89]Tavion could be using it to empower her followers.
[389:44.10]Corrupting disciples with the dark side of the force...
[389:47.50]That would explain a lot.
[389:49.38]Did you get a good look at the scepter?
[389:50.94]Yeah, I bet it belonged to Ragnos.
[389:53.76]We need to figure out what Tavion plans on doing with it if we're going to stop her.
[389:58.07]Agreed.
[389:59.54]You are going to need to build a new lightsaber to replace the one you lost.
[390:03.04]While you try to figure out what Tavion's next move is, I'd like you to take a more active role at the Academy.
[390:09.13]Sir?
[390:09.89]Jaden, you handled yourself exceptionally well on Vajoon.
[390:13.63]To confront three dark Jedi and defeat them took bravery and skill.
[390:17.97]For your efforts, I feel you are ready to join our ranks as a Jedi Knight.
[390:22.31]Oh me?
[390:22.91]Oh me?
[390:23.43]Yes, Master Skywalker.
[390:25.53]Thank you both.
[390:29.90]When do I get fired?
[390:31.12]I'll try.
[390:31.34]Oh, yep.
[390:32.10]Dual sabers.
[390:32.68]Two-handed saber.
[390:33.40]Oh, what would I have?
[390:35.10]I would have one...
[391:03.13]Big orange dual saber.
[391:14.98]Or... The Jerma985 build.
[391:22.77]Why can't I have three?
[391:42.79]the joker what do you mean the joker oh that's that yeah it kind of is isn't it it is the joker
[392:02.97]I'm going big orange.
[392:08.86]That one.
[392:17.40]Now that you're a Jedi Knight, Luke and I have decided to give you some more challenging missions.
[392:22.45]You still need to be careful though.
[392:24.05]Trouble can crop up anywhere.
[392:28.16]Okay, I'm done, but I just want to see what it looks like.
[392:30.68]These are all at level 3 already.
[392:31.90]Uh, Force Drain.
[392:32.76]Drain Life Essence.

[395:10.53]OK, let's see what happens.

[396:10.54]But how much more time do I really have in this game?
[396:16.61]What's the... Anybody know how much time is left?
[396:21.27]Like two or three hours.
[396:22.05]Is it just this or is there another section after this?
