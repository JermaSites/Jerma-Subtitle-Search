[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.05]I think it should be going here.
[00:02.17]I think so.
[00:06.07]Am I understanding you?
[00:06.97]I want to make sure I streamed it because... And for obvious purposes, I want to make sure that when people see this, they'll know that I decided to get a professional to come and do this.
[00:19.96]It might take a second or two before it goes completely live, but it's okay.
[00:24.42]Okay.
[00:25.66]I'm going to tweet that.
[00:27.56]So let me just tweet it first.
[00:28.59]Okay.
[00:31.53]Hey, just give me one second, guys.
[00:34.14]I'm trying to get this just going.
[00:39.26]This is Dr. Schmoygan, by the way.
[00:42.10]How do you do?
[00:42.66]I'm saying that right.
[00:44.82]Is it Schmoygan?
[00:46.61]It's actually Schmoygan.
[00:48.29]Schmoygan.
[00:48.83]Schmoygan.
[00:49.93]With a K?
[00:51.61]With an X. Oh, then, okay.
[00:54.09]Schmoygan.
[00:54.33]I got it.
[00:56.53]Just wanted to make sure I knew that, because... And I'm Jeremy, by the way.
[01:00.52]Hi, how are you?
[01:02.76]Sure.
[01:04.34]Polygraph.
[01:08.02]Now.
[01:09.84]So, these are questions that you guys decided to ask.
[01:14.07]I told you I was going to hook myself up to a machine.
[01:16.75]Here it is.
[01:17.87]You thought this was bullshit.
[01:20.09]It's not.
[01:22.43]So, I'm going to do it, and I'm ready.
[01:24.67]After I tweet that.
[01:29.52]I'm tweeting that the stream is live, essentially.
[01:32.85]Yeah.
[01:34.83]Should have planned it before.
[01:35.79]Should have done it before.
[01:38.25]But I didn't.
[01:40.63]So I got a question for you, Doc.
[01:42.01]Mm-hmm.
[01:44.40]If there was a way, like, for instance, I haven't eaten in two days.
[01:48.10]Okay.
[01:48.36]I've been trying to prepare for this.
[01:49.90]Uh-huh.
[01:50.40]I haven't eaten in two days, and I've been drinking just cranberry juice.
[01:53.52]Would you consider that to be a good way to potentially beat a polygraph?
[01:57.51]I'm not really sure that's the best way to go about it.
[02:02.38]Okay.
[02:03.02]I have a little trick up my sleeve if you'd like to embark on that.
[02:09.42]Whatever you would like to do to make it so I can give you the best possible answers, then I'm ready.
[02:13.70]Okay, well.
[02:16.26]Right behind me, right here, sort of a medicinal way of going about things.
[02:23.08]I'd like you to take this.
[02:24.16]Is it a supplement or some kind of nutrient?
[02:27.69]Yeah, something like that.
[02:30.15]That's a bottle of Jim Beam.
[02:33.53]Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[02:35.65]It should loosen you up a bit.
[02:38.03]Don't worry, it's a professional way of going about things.
[02:41.72]Did you drink out of this already?
[02:43.10]I may have.
[02:44.66]Some of it's missing.
[02:45.76]A little.
[02:47.00]Sorry, but, you know, I had a little time, you know, before I came here.
[02:51.84]Okay.
[02:52.50]Yeah?
[02:53.10]Yeah.
[02:53.46]So how do you want me just to drink?
[02:56.75]The whole bottle.
[02:57.51]I'm going to drink this whole bottle of Jim Bean.
[02:59.93]I would appreciate that because I think you really need to be loosened up.
[03:03.17]I can't drink a whole bottle of Jim Bean?
[03:04.81]I sort of insist.
[03:06.25]It's a professional thing.
[03:08.40]Alright, well, if this is professional, we've got a professional here that I have to have.
[03:11.36]Yeah, that's right.
[03:11.88]And that's the way this works.
[03:13.20]You understand that, don't you?
[03:14.62]Okay.
[03:15.18]Alright.
[03:15.78]Yeah, I mean, this is how it works, I guess.
[03:18.04]Down it.
[03:19.98]Can I even put it in my bottle?
[03:23.38]Sure.
[03:24.20]Go right ahead.
[03:25.56]Oh, that is Jim Bean, alright.
[03:30.79]Okay, well, I don't know if I can do that, Doug.
[03:33.49]I can do maybe one here, and then we'll set up, and then I'll do the rest.
[03:36.95]Alright.
[03:37.44]I don't know if I'm prepared for this.
[03:39.00]Alright.
[03:44.02]Tastes good, right?
[03:45.16]Yeah.
[03:46.81]Did you make this?
[03:48.47]Are you Jim Bean?
[03:49.39]That's a good jump to start.
[03:53.07]So what do I do?
[03:53.67]How do I do this?
[03:54.39]Alright.
[03:54.81]You got to put those straps on.
[03:56.44]One for the forefinger.
[03:58.25]Because this goes on the finger.
[03:59.17]Yep.
[03:59.51]You got it.
[04:00.09]You got it.
[04:00.63]Just check it out.
[04:02.29]You know, you're a smart guy.
[04:03.94]So how much is one of these?
[04:06.68]One of those is about $3,000.
[04:08.14]$3,000.
[04:08.40]So don't break it.
[04:11.74]Yeah.
[04:12.24]Please.
[04:14.22]It's probably not a good idea to break it.
[04:16.62]Yep.
[04:16.98]It's just a little tangled here.
[04:18.22]It's a wire.
[04:19.06]You twist, untwist the wire.
[04:20.71]It's pretty simple.
[04:22.53]Yeah.
[04:22.87]I mean, I know it's easy.
[04:23.95]Okay.
[04:24.21]So then this goes.
[04:25.29]Yep.
[04:26.57]That's right.
[04:28.07]Right there.
[04:28.87]You got it.
[04:29.95]Okay.
[04:30.45]Alright.
[04:31.35]The waist strap.
[04:32.35]It has to go in like this?
[04:33.85]That's it.
[04:34.41]Okay.
[04:36.87]Make sure it's tight.
[04:38.40]So under the abdomen or where does it go?
[04:40.50]Like come in here?
[04:41.24]Yeah.
[04:41.74]That's it.
[04:42.22]Like that.
[04:42.74]So what is this for?
[04:44.06]That is going to test your breathing.
[04:47.20]Okay.
[04:47.78]It's going to let people know when you're breathing heavily or not.
[04:54.92]And when you're breathing heavily, okay, we know you might be not telling the truth.
[05:01.03]Yeah, but, like, how is this supposed to even know what I'm doing?
[05:04.85]It just measures.
[05:06.87]It just gauges your body, you know, what's going on.
[05:08.74]Is that tight enough here?
[05:09.48]Is that good, you think?
[05:10.94]I believe so.
[05:11.80]Okay.
[05:12.14]It looks good.
[05:13.10]Yeah.
[05:13.30]So then what's the next step here?
[05:14.54]Okay, the finger.
[05:16.20]Yep.
[05:16.66]Does it matter?
[05:17.54]Right hand?
[05:17.88]Is it right hand right here?
[05:19.02]I believe right there.
[05:20.06]Okay.
[05:20.48]Yep.
[05:21.01]Yep.
[05:21.59]That would be good.
[05:22.59]And then these, what are these for?
[05:23.85]On the index.
[05:25.01]These go on my head?
[05:25.83]Oh, no.
[05:26.17]Right on the head?
[05:26.83]You know what I'm saying?
[05:29.69]Hey, you've been drinking too much of that stuff already.
[05:32.03]What?
[05:33.67]I had like one sip.
[05:35.12]Yeah, well, you're going to have to get through the whole thing.
[05:37.20]This is on all the fingers?
[05:38.52]Yeah, forefinger.
[05:40.24]Like this, I guess.
[05:41.46]Wrap it around.
[05:43.08]Oh, OK.
[05:43.44]I see.
[05:43.82]I see.
[05:45.04]That's it.
[05:48.04]Does it matter how tight this is?
[05:51.24]Just tight enough.
[05:52.66]Just tight enough.
[05:54.54]On the index figure?
[05:55.74]Yeah, that's it.
[05:57.68]So what does this measure?
[05:59.16]That is also, we have different parts of it that we have different leads here and some of it measures your sweat, some of it measures your blood.
[06:08.69]Okay.
[06:09.31]Yep.
[06:10.33]So I'm all hooked up, right?
[06:12.35]So this is sweat, this is blood.
[06:14.13]Yep.
[06:14.77]Yep.
[06:15.43]That's it.
[06:16.37]Breathing.
[06:17.19]Yeah.
[06:17.49]Anything about the brain?
[06:18.29]Don't eat my brain.
[06:20.09]No, we're not exactly.
[06:21.35]We're not going to turn you into Frankenstein.
[06:23.16]I'm sorry.
[06:25.90]Frankenstein, actually.
[06:26.93]Frankenstein.
[06:27.51]Frankenstein.
[06:28.71]Yeah, again with the correct pronunciations.
[06:32.49]So now, do I have to rest this over here?
[06:35.51]I don't want to break you $3,500.
[06:36.87]Probably a good idea.
[06:39.06]No, you don't want to do that.
[06:41.16]I'm ready to answer these questions that you've decided, and I'm going to give you truthful answers.
[06:47.84]Alright.
[06:48.86]Now, are you really ready?
[06:50.26]I'm ready.
[06:51.12]Really ready.
[06:52.07]Okay.
[06:52.95]Alright.
[06:53.33]Then I believe we should begin.
[06:55.17]Okay.
[06:55.83]Thank you, Dr. Schmoikson.
[06:57.65]Certainly.
[06:58.15]Let's go get it started here.
[07:06.08]Okay.
[07:07.82]Now, can I see what you're doing?
[07:09.08]Sure.
[07:09.34]I'm just curious.
[07:10.68]Yep.
[07:12.10]Cool.
[07:14.24]That's kind of cool.
[07:15.18]There we go.
[07:15.78]Okay.
[07:16.82]Alright.
[07:17.30]So what do I need to do?
[07:21.21]Alright.
[07:21.67]Well, we're just going to click on this again.
[07:25.03]We're going to get started here.
[07:26.49]Okay.
[07:27.77]Okay.
[07:28.57]Alright.
[07:29.19]And we're going to have a few questions for you sort of to start out.
[07:35.92]Okay.
[07:36.50]It's all yes or no.
[07:37.46]Okay.
[07:38.22]The entire exam is yes or no.
[07:40.60]Okay.
[07:41.00]We give you a few practice questions in the beginning just to check up on you.
[07:45.89]Just to check up on what?
[07:48.74]We're going to check to make sure we know that you can tell the truth in the first place.
[07:55.87]I can tell the truth just fine, but I'll humor you.
[07:59.16]Alright.
[07:59.80]This is for what, a baseline?
[08:01.52]Baseline is exactly the right word.
[08:03.96]So can you see me breathing?
[08:08.03]That is part of the polygraph, yes.
[08:10.14]Okay.
[08:11.02]It will let you know.
[08:13.00]I feel like this is going to enter my mind.
[08:15.12]Okay.
[08:15.90]Now, I just want to make sure that we're real clear.
[08:20.77]It's important to answer each question truthfully.
[08:23.81]Okay.
[08:24.59]Alright?
[08:25.77]Okay.
[08:26.09]Should I close my eyes?
[08:28.17]No, I wouldn't think that would be a good idea.
[08:30.61]Okay.
[08:31.07]We want to keep an eye on you.
[08:34.65]Alright, and yes or no answers again.
[08:37.32]You got it.
[08:37.64]Okay.
[08:39.34]Have you ever lied, sir, to a loved one?
[08:45.62]Yes.
[08:46.76]Okay.
[08:54.02]You okay?
[08:54.78]Yeah, I'm alright.
[08:55.96]Alright.
[08:56.34]I think you need more of that bottle going there.
[08:58.61]Yeah, I did the whole thing, right?
[09:00.25]Yeah.
[09:01.11]God damn it.
[09:02.47]Well, never mind.
[09:03.43]I guess you can't get at it.
[09:05.71]I can't.
[09:06.53]Maybe at the halfway point.
[09:07.87]Mm-hmm.
[09:08.95]Okay.
[09:09.53]Okay.
[09:11.50]Alright.
[09:11.96]We're just checking up on you here.
[09:13.86]It's running.
[09:14.58]It's rolling.
[09:15.36]I'm taking a look.
[09:17.62]Alright.
[09:20.60]I'm detecting some poor body language there.
[09:26.63]I don't know about you.
[09:27.65]I didn't even move.
[09:28.92]Ah, come on.
[09:29.56]I didn't do anything.
[09:30.40]I was sitting like this the whole time.
[09:31.62]What is this guy?
[09:32.20]I've been sitting straight like this.
[09:35.70]Come on.
[09:36.14]Body language?
[09:36.64]Body language.
[09:37.90]Yeah, we know him.
[09:38.98]That's bullshit.
[09:39.98]Yeah, this can tell you everything.
[09:41.34]This guy's shifty, I'll tell you.
[09:43.92]You can tell right away.
[09:44.98]Alright, alright.
[09:46.00]I'll try again.
[09:46.52]Here you go.
[09:47.14]Ready?
[09:47.60]I'm ready.
[09:48.04]Alright, ready?
[09:48.96]Okay.
[09:49.92]Have you ever been dishonest?
[09:54.31]Yes.
[09:55.94]Pretty much only one answer to that question.
[09:58.78]Who hasn't been dishonest?
[10:00.00]Everybody's been dishonest.
[10:01.09]Okay.
[10:01.41]Well, you passed that one.
[10:02.47]I'll just tell you.
[10:03.37]Okay.
[10:03.59]I passed that one.
[10:04.71]Good.
[10:04.87]You passed that one.
[10:05.79]How could you not be dishonest?
[10:06.91]How could you not be dishonest?
[10:08.39]That's true.
[10:08.95]I've been dishonest to my dog.
[10:10.84]And he doesn't even know.
[10:12.24]There you go.
[10:13.06]Really?
[10:13.62]Well, he doesn't know.
[10:14.32]How is he supposed to know?
[10:14.94]He's a dog.
[10:17.87]I just, yeah, a little concerned, but I'm, you know, well, I'm sorry, but you know, you have to, the equipment's the equipment.
[10:29.05]I can't do anything.
[10:29.83]It's supposed to be like buzzing.
[10:31.02]Alright.
[10:31.30]Alright.
[10:31.66]Wait a minute.
[10:32.12]I got another, I got another question.
[10:33.64]You ready?
[10:33.98]Yeah.
[10:34.26]You're really ready.
[10:35.20]I'm ready.
[10:35.50]Alright.
[10:36.52]Have you ever felt angry?
[10:42.68]I don't see that as angry.
[10:43.78]Yes, I have.
[10:45.14]I absolutely felt angry.
[10:46.96]Alright.
[10:47.32]I'm not quite seeing that as angry, but I'm going to say yes.
[10:50.70]And I think... I'm already shit-faced.
[10:55.34]That's pretty... We got you going.
[10:58.88]Okay.
[10:59.26]Yes, I've been angry.
[11:00.48]Yep.
[11:01.28]This is how we like all of our patients here.
[11:05.36]All of our test subjects.
[11:07.68]It's pretty much a professional way to go about it.
[11:13.86]That's more like hyperventilating than breathing, Jeremy.
[11:18.18]What's my beats per minute?
[11:21.54]What's my beats by Dre per minute?
[11:23.96]Alright, it looks like it's about 16, something like that.
[11:28.06]16.
[11:28.48]Yep.
[11:28.92]Sounds pretty good.
[11:32.38]Alright, here you go.
[11:33.16]You ready?
[11:33.52]Alright, here we go.
[11:36.04]Have you ever betrayed someone who trusted you?
[11:43.46]No.
[11:45.19]Okay.
[11:46.13]No.
[11:46.99]Let's check it out.
[11:52.13]Alright.
[11:52.93]It's going about analyzing.
[11:54.47]I don't know about that answer myself, but you know.
[11:57.73]I never betrayed anybody that I love.
[11:59.25]I mean, I betrayed plenty of people that I don't love.
[12:03.10]Okay.
[12:03.88]Okay.
[12:04.88]I guess that's an acceptable.
[12:06.06]You're getting like an NSA profile of me right now before you ask the questions.
[12:09.70]Yeah.
[12:10.02]Well, we have to know.
[12:11.28]We have to know.
[12:12.57]We want to know everything, don't we?
[12:15.32]Yeah, that's kind of hard to do.
[12:21.42]Alright.
[12:23.14]While you're trying to do that, I want to try to confuse you.
[12:26.16]So I'm going to ask you another question.
[12:28.12]Sure.
[12:28.38]While you're trying to do all that and see if you can do it all at the same time.
[12:31.78]Sure.
[12:32.06]Have you ever done anything for which you are now ashamed?
[12:37.83]Yes.
[12:40.09]Yes, I have.
[12:40.91]Alright.
[12:42.17]These are such easy questions.
[12:43.35]Bring on the good ones, Doc.
[12:45.27]Well, like I said, they have to have test questions first.
[12:49.31]Okay, analyzing that a bit.
[12:51.69]I think that stuff is starting to work.
[12:54.09]You picked the worst whiskey possible.
[12:56.33]Well, you know.
[12:57.57]Jim Beam.
[12:59.53]You didn't even give me Johnny Walker.
[13:01.33]Hey, Johnny was out of town.
[13:02.97]What can I say?
[13:04.65]Alright.
[13:05.11]Alright.
[13:06.48]Alright.
[13:07.22]Now, are you good and ready now?
[13:08.82]I'm ready.
[13:09.60]Because I can, you know, just really, really ready.
[13:13.94]Okay.
[13:14.28]I feel like I'm sweating anyways.
[13:17.56]Alright.
[13:18.64]Calculating our baselines now, Jeremy.
[13:21.76]Okay.
[13:23.24]So, now we come to the actual questions.
[13:26.26]Those are only the test ones.
[13:28.03]So, these are the questions that we get the baseline just to make sure.
[13:30.43]Yeah, we got the baseline.
[13:31.69]Yeah, we got it.
[13:32.41]Do you eat asps?
[13:39.89]No.
[13:41.77]Alright.
[13:42.58]We'll enter that.
[13:44.60]Here we go.
[13:45.08]Alright.
[13:47.26]We're analyzing that a bit.
[13:48.88]I don't know if that question made you a little bit uncomfortable, but we're just going to continue.
[13:55.20]Okay.
[13:55.66]Yeah, I only have, I don't have all that much time here today.
[13:59.88]I know.
[14:01.04]So, you know, we're just doing the best we can.
[14:04.11]We're going to have to move right on to the next question.
[14:06.95]Okay.
[14:08.02]Alright, okay.
[14:09.06]And the results will be afterwards.
[14:10.32]And the results come afterwards, that's right.

[14:35.10]Alright.
[14:35.98]So, well, I don't know.
[14:38.74]I mean, obviously that was, some of these questions weren't exactly yes or no questions.

[14:54.46]So what can I do?
[14:55.54]What can I say?
[14:56.28]Right.
[14:56.92]Alright?
[14:57.71]Your hands are tied.
[14:59.51]No, it's actually your hands that are tied.
[15:01.77]Anyway, what's your favorite kind of music, Jeremy?
[15:05.43]Oh, yes.
[15:09.95]I would say alternative rock.
[15:13.40]That's not true.

[15:50.60]Yes.
[15:50.74]Okay.
[15:51.24]Alright.
[15:52.52]I do believe.

[16:12.93]No.
[16:13.13]The answer is no.
[16:14.35]That's a real certificate.
[16:16.47]I won that in the Blockbuster Video Game Championships.
[16:18.51]The answer is no.

[16:28.88]Alright.
[16:29.62]I already put it in that answer.
[16:31.52]So... Because it's true.
[16:32.94]Okay.
[16:33.70]I won Donkey Kong Country and I collected all the bananas.
[16:37.74]At least like 200 bananas.
[16:39.42]200 bananas?
[16:40.20]Yeah.
[16:41.10]You would have freaked out if you saw that.
[16:42.24]It was amazing.
[16:43.34]Okay.
[16:43.92]I got all the bananas.
[16:44.80]I beat people that were like 15 years older than me.
[16:47.66]Do you really count the bananas though?
[16:51.70]No.
[16:52.24]See?
[16:53.10]We caught him in another... Alright.

[17:19.00]Alright, I'm going to go process that question a bit.
[17:24.56]Okay, still looking at the, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:28.34]Body language is telling me you're feeling a little uncomfortable.
[17:32.02]I don't know.
[17:32.78]A little bit.
[17:34.36]Yeah, a little bit.
[17:35.46]Okay.
[17:36.72]Yeah, but that medicine seems to be working out for you, though.

[18:55.10]Next question.
[18:56.04]I like this one.
[18:59.40]Does baldness run in your family or did you just get unlucky with your genes?
[19:08.78]Yes.
[19:10.08]Yes.
[19:10.82]Okay.
[19:11.54]Yes.
[19:12.06]Well, I'm going to guess that's an honest answer.
[19:14.72]Okay.
[19:15.10]Okay.
[19:15.96]How far does it run?
[19:17.16]Okay.
[19:17.74]All the way back to my grandmother's grandmother.
[19:20.06]Grandmother's grandmother.
[19:21.30]Grandmother's grandfather, actually.
[19:22.48]Sorry about that.
[19:22.82]Grandmother's grandfather.
[19:23.72]Don't tell me lies here.
[19:25.14]I would hope that it was the grandfather.
[19:26.84]Yeah, grandma.
[19:28.31]Oh, my grandmother's bald.
[19:30.19]All the way back to Tilly.
[19:32.53]Yeah.
[19:33.47]Grandma Tilly.
[19:34.49]Grandma Tilly.
[19:35.31]1721.
[19:35.45]Uh-huh.
[19:36.81]Full head of bald hair.
[19:38.71]Yeah.

[19:43.25]Wherever she was from.
[19:44.23]Okay.

[19:50.85]Yes.
[19:55.81]Alright.
[19:57.67]Okay.
[19:58.49]Whatever.
[19:58.91]We're going to put that in as yes.
[20:00.83]Okay.
[20:03.89]And we'll see.
[20:05.05]More than once.
[20:06.03]I'm checking.
[20:06.63]Oh, more than once.
[20:07.69]Okay.
[20:09.57]Alright.
[20:10.28]I hope this guy's telling the truth.
[20:12.98]I don't know.
[20:15.16]Anyway, okay, we're going to find out.
[20:17.95]Look, sometimes you've always just can't hold it.
[20:19.83]And, you know, I've got litus.
[20:22.77]I've had it since I was 20.
[20:24.93]Alright.
[20:26.25]Well, like they said, the truth will come out in the end.
[20:28.53]Yes, it will.
[20:29.66]Okay.
[20:30.92]Alright.
[20:32.22]Now, we're analyzing this a bit.
[20:34.30]Next question.
[20:35.32]Do you hate your viewers?
[20:40.30]No.
[20:40.85]No?
[20:42.28]No.
[20:42.62]Final answer?
[20:43.56]Final answer, no.
[20:44.14]Final answer, no.
[20:45.62]Okay.

[20:59.25]No, I don't.
[21:00.55]Alright.
[21:01.39]No, I don't.
[21:02.39]Okay.
[21:03.49]I think we established that.
[21:04.89]A little more Jim Beam.
[21:05.91]Yeah, you need more of that.
[21:07.77]Yeah.
[21:08.75]Alright.
[21:10.95]Okay, let's see now.
[21:13.37]Does my hair look alright, Doc?
[21:14.35]It needs to be moved a little bit.
[21:17.99]I think it will stay on your head.
[21:19.39]That's probably the best place for it.
[21:21.45]Alright.
[21:22.35]So, Jeremy.
[21:25.13]Yes.
[21:25.77]You ready?
[21:26.23]That wasn't an answer to a question.
[21:27.11]That was responding.
[21:29.55]You're allowed to respond.
[21:31.31]Okay.
[21:31.79]Do you secretly dab off stream?
[21:39.38]No.
[21:40.94]Absolutely not.
[21:41.64]No.
[21:41.86]No.
[21:42.16]No.
[21:43.35]No.
[21:43.55]No.
[21:46.01]Alright, we'll put it in.
[21:46.93]Okay.
[21:48.67]What kind of fucking question is this?
[21:50.91]I don't know what kind of question it is, but it's the question that somebody asked.
[21:54.71]No, I don't dab off stream.
[21:55.73]I haven't dabbed in my life.
[21:56.44]I'm just trying to be a professional here.
[21:57.50]Have you ever dabbed in your life?
[21:58.72]I, you know, what can I say?
[22:00.14]I have to tell the truth.
[22:01.78]I'm not the one who's taking the test.
[22:03.44]Should I put this on you and ask you if you've ever dabbed?
[22:05.54]I, you're not going to get me to do it.
[22:08.06]I'm sorry.
[22:08.90]Good man.
[22:09.79]Alright.
[22:11.39]I'm sorry.
[22:12.11]I've got a job to do.
[22:13.71]That's a great answer.
[22:15.10]I've got a job to do.
[22:16.54]That's where I was six months ago.
[22:17.88]And that's what we're doing.
[22:19.02]What?
[22:19.32]That's where I was six months ago and I got convinced to do it once.
[22:23.00]I'm not sure what you mean, but that's okay.
[22:24.81]That's alright.
[22:25.41]Alright.
[22:26.71]Next question, Jeremy.
[22:27.93]Do you think that 80% of these questions are meme questions?
[22:33.90]Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.
[22:35.40]You didn't let me finish the answer.
[22:37.98]What was it?
[22:38.52]You didn't let me finish the question.
[22:39.91]What's the rest of it?
[22:40.51]Alright.
[22:42.19]You going to let me finish the question?
[22:43.23]Yeah, finish it.
[22:44.15]Alright.
[22:44.95]Look, I've got a job to do.
[22:46.01]I'm going to finish the question, right?

[23:01.18]Yes.
[23:02.46]Press yes as fast as you can.
[23:04.66]I'm pressing.
[23:05.23]The fastest you can press the answer yes.
[23:07.25]Alright.

[23:08.49]I'm pressing, okay?
[23:10.61]Alright.
[23:11.83]Okay, well, I can tell that that one made you a little nervous.
[23:15.91]That question made you a little nervous.
[23:17.99]It might have.
[23:19.23]No, no, no, wait.
[23:19.85]I'm fine.
[23:22.53]That's a good idea.
[23:23.38]A little breath, another bit of a little drink.
[23:26.84]That should help you out, okay?
[23:28.88]Doc, you're getting me drunk here.
[23:30.16]Hey, it's more fun.
[23:35.38]How about $35,000?
[23:37.81]Alright, are you ready?

[23:39.71]Really ready?
[23:40.45]I'm ready.
[23:40.77]Okay.
[23:42.74]You're loosening up here a bit, I can tell.
[23:44.76]Just a little bit.
[23:45.44]Alright.
[23:45.74]What is your favorite trait of your community?
[23:51.23]Interesting question.
[23:52.33]Interesting question.
[23:53.15]Interesting.
[23:55.37]Yes.
[23:58.09]I'm not sure that's the answer that they were looking for.
[24:01.43]I think the most interesting trait of my community is their sense of humor.
[24:09.28]Sense of humor.
[24:10.04]Sense of humor.
[24:10.68]Sense of humor.
[24:11.38]And sense of belonging.

[25:48.73]Okay.
[25:49.53]Now, Jeremy, are you currently being held hostage?
[25:54.96]Or maybe he feels like it.

[27:19.92]Doctor, is that pee in your pants?
[27:22.64]No, it's just sweat.
[27:27.30]Okay.

[27:52.00]I'm getting a little impatient here.
[27:53.38]Yes, I have.
[27:54.28]Alright.
[27:55.04]As long as you answer the question.
[27:56.84]Yes.

[27:59.39]Keep up with it.
[28:00.57]Keep going.
[28:01.19]We're going to keep this thing rolling, okay?
[28:05.16]We're going to keep an eye on this, too, though.
[28:07.38]Hmm.
[28:08.96]Yeah, it's probably because you're a little short of breath now.
[28:14.48]Deep breathing is probably a good idea.
[28:16.30]That's a good one.
[28:17.68]That was a good one.
[28:18.42]That was good.
[28:19.38]Alright.

[42:19.37]I'm still not totally sure.
[42:21.09]Let's see what this shit says.
[42:23.97]I'm that all over the place?
[42:25.73]Am I going that fucking crazy?
[42:29.57]Maybe you are going crazy.
[42:31.81]Maybe that's what's happening here.
[42:34.14]Jeremy, is Elbertson truly your family name?
[42:46.83]Yes.
[42:47.09]Okay.
[42:51.75]Alright.
[42:53.28]So, rolling once again.
[42:57.38]Still feeling okay there, Jeremy?
[42:59.98]Yes.
[43:00.52]Okay.
[43:01.58]Remember to breathe.
[43:03.36]We should all breathe.
[43:08.60]Don't pop the belt off, though.
[43:10.10]That's all I can say.
[43:11.10]I don't wear belts.
[43:12.80]Boy, you got some peaks here, sir.
[43:16.10]My goodness.
[43:16.70]I don't know what's going on with that.
[43:19.47]What?
[43:19.97]That's rather unusual.
[43:21.65]What do you mean?
[43:22.27]Well, it's just sort of all over the place.
[43:26.55]Big highs, big lows.
[43:28.87]Well, it's open to interpretation a bit.
[43:31.35]Okay.
[43:32.71]Have you been flossing your teeth, sir?
[43:39.92]No.
[43:40.72]No.
[43:42.98]Well, at least that's probably an honest answer.
[43:47.01]You asked the questions.
[43:48.53]He's giving you the answers.
[43:50.71]That's all I can say.
[43:53.89]I know.
[43:54.73]Dental questions.
[43:55.47]I want to see this.
[43:56.89]Oh, shit.
[43:57.53]I'm sorry.
[43:58.20]Yes, please don't break everything.
[43:59.90]You can see, right?
[44:03.20]You can see?
[44:03.68]I'm going to turn this up.
[44:06.52]I can see that the sun's going down.
[44:08.14]Hold on.
[44:10.76]Okay.
[44:11.68]Brighten it up a bit.
[44:12.96]Brighten this.
[44:14.09]Alright.
[44:20.44]Wait.
[44:21.86]Okay.
[44:22.42]Oh, that's way too bright.
[44:23.62]That's bright.
[44:24.20]I'm extremely sorry about that.
[44:26.50]Let's drop that a little.
[44:29.78]Don't put this in your exam.
[44:30.78]Alright.
[44:32.82]I got some good ones for you.
[44:34.32]Hold on.
[44:43.51]Here we go.
[44:49.70]Sounds going down.
[44:50.40]Just relax.
[44:50.62]Just a short technical break.
[44:51.98]OK.
[44:53.46]Alright, Jeremy, I think this is probably one of the most important questions that you asked tonight.
[44:59.86]Have you been drinking your own brain fluid?
[45:06.02]No.
[45:06.90]No.
[45:08.53]OK.
[45:11.07]I don't know.
[45:11.61]It would have explained something.
[45:14.67]Yeah.
[45:16.67]I can't even.
[45:17.63]Where's the chat here?
[45:19.67]Do you have a chat on there?
[45:20.87]No.
[45:21.79]Hold on.
[45:22.61]I'm fucking a little irritated.
[45:24.01]It's not here.
[45:25.19]Okay, check it out.
[45:27.07]Yep.
[45:34.90]Don't look at this.
[45:35.48]Okay, that's better.
[45:36.04]Okay.
[45:36.16]Cool.
[45:43.80]Are we good?
[45:45.02]Remember I'm being paid by the hour here, Jeremy.
[45:47.80]Alright.
[45:50.88]67 trillion dollars.
[45:51.97]On the table, that's it.
[45:53.09]Okay, you ready?
[45:53.97]I'm ready.
[45:54.65]Are you tired of peel, peel, peeling potatoes?
[46:05.53]Yeah.
[46:06.69]Yes.
[46:07.27]Yes.
[46:07.87]Okay.
[46:08.51]Tired of the po and the tay and the toe.
[46:15.97]Alright.
[46:16.76]Oh, boy.
[46:20.54]It's abstract art, basically, is what we're creating with these peaks and valleys, Jeremy.
[46:26.78]Mm-hmm.
[46:28.63]Hmm.
[46:32.75]Alright.
[46:33.03]Fucking machine.
[46:34.79]Alright.
[46:36.45]We're going to come up with the next question in a minute.
[46:38.55]You want to check your connections for me?
[46:40.55]Yeah, I'm linked up pretty good here.
[46:42.81]Alright.
[46:44.61]Jeremy, is Otto a giant rat in disguise?
[46:51.05]No, he's a dog.
[46:52.15]No.
[46:53.75]Dog.
[46:54.27]What a terrible question.
[46:58.49]No.
[46:58.97]I would kind of comply with that.
[47:00.92]He's a dog.
[47:01.50]He's a fucking dog.
[47:02.24]He's a dog.
[47:03.18]Are you guys for real?
[47:04.36]He's got a tail.
[47:05.82]He's got feet, you know, nose, ears.
[47:09.78]Dog.
[47:13.82]Alright.
[47:14.20]No.
[47:14.78]No?
[47:16.56]That was a no.
[47:19.07]And my goodness.
[47:22.45]Yeah, I think you're going to find this interesting.
[47:26.03]Maybe not what you expect exactly.
[47:29.78]As far as the results go, bud, here's the next question.
[47:32.86]You ready?
[47:33.50]I'm ready.
[47:34.14]Okay, dude.
[47:35.68]Who is your favorite comedian?
[47:40.79]There's too many.
[47:42.45]George Carlin, Bill Burr, Jim Carrey.
[47:45.85]Yes.
[47:46.91]Okay.
[47:47.45]We'll do a yes.
[47:48.21]George Carlin, Bill Burr, Jim Carrey.
[47:50.29]Okay.
[47:52.47]Yeah, you've got those lined up.
[47:56.88]Alright.
[48:00.60]Yes.
[48:01.72]Yeah, yes answer.
[48:03.38]Good answer.
[48:04.36]A yes.
[48:06.10]Alright.
[48:08.66]So you got sign language there, Jeremy?
[48:12.13]I'm just making sure that my apparatuses are completely being taken into consideration.
[48:16.63]I believe it's apparati, by the way.
[48:19.29]Fuck.
[48:20.25]Yeah.
[48:21.41]I think that was a good answer.
[48:22.91]Alright, you ready?
[48:23.67]Did you ever actually have...
[48:26.59]A sponsorship at one point.
[48:29.57]No.
[48:30.56]Not at all.
[48:31.40]Not at all.
[48:31.74]No.
[48:32.00]Not at all.
[48:32.96]Not at all.
[48:34.60]Not at all.
[48:35.72]Okay.
[48:37.04]Hmm.
[48:38.22]No.
[48:38.92]Hmm.
[48:41.12]Yeah, looking at those lines.
[48:44.79]A few gaps there.
[48:46.33]I guess there might be gaps in your thought process.
[48:49.91]Something of the sort.
[48:50.81]I've never had a thought process.
[48:53.44]Never had a sponsorship.
[48:54.44]Okay.
[48:54.94]And the whole time I've had a YouTube channel or a Twitch stream.
[48:57.20]No.
[48:57.64]Okay.
[48:58.56]Well, thought process thing, like I said, I am getting more confident that you're telling the truth all the time.
[49:05.15]Alright.
[49:06.17]Jeremy, did you cancel the Glue Man animated series?
[49:12.75]Yes.
[49:13.39]You did.
[49:14.81]You did.
[49:15.55]Yes, I did.
[49:16.27]The world did want to know.
[49:18.89]And now they know.
[49:20.67]Yes.
[49:22.67]All righty then.
[49:24.69]All righty.
[49:25.93]I'm sensing something different here.
[49:28.12]A little bit of calm on your point.
[49:32.62]I'm wondering what... Just making sure I'm completely transparent.
[49:38.46]Yeah.
[49:38.98]Yes, I did.
[49:40.18]It's not happening.
[49:42.59]Yeah.
[49:44.08]Yep.
[49:46.24]I guess that made you feel a little bit more relaxed.
[49:48.82]We've got him in the right kind of mood now.
[49:50.62]Okay, now you've got to answer your hard questions.
[49:53.60]Alright, here you go.
[49:54.32]You ready?
[49:55.25]Do you want us to give you money?
[50:03.65]No.
[50:04.37]No.
[50:05.72]Alright.
[50:10.93]Okay.
[50:11.41]Hey, they wanted to know you answered the question.
[50:16.61]Alright.
[50:18.77]Why are you laughing?
[50:23.93]Why is that funny?
[50:26.17]Never mind.
[50:26.55]No, you're doing fine.
[50:27.39]Okay, good.
[50:27.75]You're doing fine.
[50:29.05]That's all I can say.
[50:30.81]Is my fly gone?
[50:31.97]They'll find out.
[50:33.65]No.
[50:35.04]They'll laugh.
[50:37.68]Remember, people are going to be looking at the answers to these.
[50:40.94]They're going to be looking at the graph.
[50:43.28]Are you ready?
[50:43.84]I'm ready.
[50:44.52]How do you sleep at night, Jeremy?
[50:51.43]Not good.
[50:52.25]No.
[50:52.87]Not well.
[50:53.41]No.
[50:54.99]Very badly.
[50:55.87]I don't get very good sleep or sleep.
[50:58.81]Alright.
[50:59.49]I guess I put a no into that.
[51:01.08]No.
[51:01.74]Not good sleep.
[51:02.54]Alright.
[51:02.84]No.
[51:03.56]Not good sleep.
[51:04.30]No.
[51:05.48]Not for sleeping.
[51:06.89]Sleeping erratically.
[51:07.85]Yeah, I think that's made him a little nervous again.
[51:11.39]Alright, here we go.
[51:13.35]We got the peaks and valleys running there again.
[51:18.07]Finding more about you, about...
[51:20.52]out about you all the time.
[51:21.94]What do you know?
[51:22.82]Yeah.
[51:23.55]You don't know shit.
[51:24.43]I know what I'm doing.
[51:25.55]The machine is calculating my answers.
[51:27.61]You're not.
[51:28.23]Yes, it is.
[51:29.23]That's right.
[51:30.55]But I know how to interpret the damn thing.
[51:32.17]I'm hooked up to a machine.
[51:33.09]The machine will tell all.
[51:34.23]Don't listen to this guy.
[51:35.45]Not yet.
[51:36.25]What you're hooked up to is a little bit of Jim Beam there.
[51:39.65]So, alright, Jeremy.
[51:42.51]Yeah.
[51:47.03]The machine is to tell.
[51:48.25]Okay, machine, as you were saying.
[51:50.95]The machine now has detected some irregularities.
[51:56.09]Did I smash it too much?
[51:57.73]Did I bump it too many times?
[52:00.53]I think that you perhaps... What did I do?
[52:03.20]Did I break it?
[52:04.20]No.
[52:06.08]Would you like to explain... You're getting into another question.
[52:09.36]Sit down, please.
[52:10.10]There's more fucking questions.
[52:11.60]Would you like to explain any of your answers?
[52:17.63]No.
[52:18.33]No?
[52:18.53]Okay.
[52:20.23]Okay.
[52:22.31]And now, sir, you will know that your exam is now complete.
[52:28.11]It's complete?
[52:28.81]It is complete.
[52:29.79]So now we get to see the answers, right?
[52:32.43]Yeah, you get to see the results.
[52:35.17]Can I get this shit off my hands?
[52:36.65]You can.
[52:40.05]Most transparent goddamn streamer on Twitch.
[52:43.65]The most transparent streamer.
[52:45.11]Here we go.
[52:50.60]Did you put it in a bag or what am I gonna do with this?
[52:54.10]Uh, no, just leave them on the table.
[52:55.98]I'll take care of them.
[52:57.42]Need some help?
[53:01.30]Pull this underwear off me.
[53:02.40]I didn't think this was an escape artist, Joey.
[53:06.01]I can't get it off.
[53:08.79]Just pull down your underwear on Twitch and get banned for life.
[53:11.73]My ass is too big.
[53:12.67]I gotta go a little more.
[53:15.69]It sounds like you're feeding a few more questions.
[53:17.97]Alright.
[53:18.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[53:20.93]Let me see this.
[53:22.39]Go right ahead.
[53:23.41]So this is all done?
[53:25.02]The exam is done?
[53:25.66]It is, sir.
[53:27.84]Okay.
[53:28.40]You slider.
[53:29.12]Hold on.
[53:29.40]I've got to make sure you can see this shit.
[53:31.90]Fucking find out the truth once and for all.
[53:42.20]It's up.
[53:44.59]So we're going to find out what the truth is.
[53:52.41]Is that me?
[53:54.03]That's me?
[53:55.67]Yeah, that's you, alright.
[53:56.95]This is me.
[53:57.69]This is you.
[53:59.27]Why am I all over the place?
[54:01.15]What did I tell you?
[54:02.39]Back to the beginning.
[54:04.81]Okay, so have you ever lied to a loved one is what this says.
[54:08.79]It says yes.
[54:09.89]These are the baseline questions.
[54:11.62]This is to get the baseline.
[54:12.58]Okay.
[54:12.94]You got it.
[54:14.51]Yeah.
[54:15.11]So I just go forward from here?
[54:16.41]Uh-huh.
[54:16.97]Okay.
[54:19.01]Okay.
[54:19.81]Do you eat ass?
[54:21.45]The answer was no.
[54:23.93]That was truthful.
[54:25.49]Can you see?
[54:26.29]Truthful up there?
[54:26.95]Truthful.
[54:27.89]You see that?
[54:29.19]It says truthful.
[54:31.14]The answer was no.
[54:32.40]I do not eat ass.
[54:34.36]Give me a fucking break.
[54:35.80]Truthful.
[54:39.14]I do not eat ass.
[54:43.06]What about the next one?
[54:44.26]There you go.
[54:44.96]Truthful.
[54:45.78]How old are you?
[54:46.64]I said 32.
[54:47.40]You see that?
[54:50.55]Truthful.
[54:52.27]32.
[54:56.13]Got that one.
[54:58.47]Keep going.
[54:59.07]What's your favorite food?
[55:00.35]You didn't ask that.
[55:02.93]I said the gorillas' favorite music.
[55:06.12]Truthful.
[55:07.92]You can see that, right?
[55:10.20]Truthful.
[55:11.42]That's my favorite music.
[55:14.33]Keep going.
[55:17.21]What else we got?
[55:19.84]Is that gamer certificate fake?
[55:21.60]The answer was no.
[55:23.82]Truthful.
[55:26.52]This is a real polygraph test, guys.
[55:28.48]You think I'm fucking around?
[55:30.40]That's a real gamer certificate.
[55:33.26]Truthful.
[55:36.81]Get fucked.
[55:39.53]What else we got?
[55:43.91]When are we getting the next Jerma Rumble?
[55:45.51]I said 2019.
[55:45.83]That's a truthful.
[55:51.11]You don't think I know how to beat these goddamn things?
[55:54.51]Oh, whoops.
[55:54.85]Hold on.
[55:57.09]Yes, truthful.
[55:59.79]I'm just going to keep it there so you can see.
[56:03.35]2019.
[56:05.61]Do you know the current location of Dick Dastardly Richard?
[56:08.60]The answer was no.
[56:11.06]And that's undetermined.
[56:13.49]We have to get the professional's mindset.
[56:16.30]What do you think?
[56:18.48]If you take a look at this chart, undetermined.
[56:21.22]Yeah, that's exactly how I'd read that.
[56:23.84]Right.
[56:24.22]Exactly.
[56:25.70]Do I know or do I don't know?
[56:27.26]Well, you wouldn't know because it's undetermined.
[56:32.95]Undetermined.
[56:33.65]You see that shit?
[56:35.27]Look at that.
[56:36.85]Undetermined.
[56:40.36]Yeah, this guy got me drunk.
[56:42.34]Okay.
[56:42.46]Okay.
[56:43.58]Here we go.
[56:46.19]Undetermined.
[56:48.67]Here we go.
[56:49.07]Does baldness run in your family or did you just get unlucky?
[56:52.17]The answer is I said yes.
[56:55.15]That's truthful.
[56:56.75]You see that?
[56:58.41]It does run in my family.
[57:00.83]My father's bald.
[57:02.05]My father's father's bald.
[57:04.37]How would you not know that?
[57:05.35]Yes, of course it runs in my family.
[57:06.85]This is a fucking real test.
[57:14.83]Okay.
[57:16.17]Have you shit your pants over the age of 20?
[57:18.93]The answer I said was yes, and that was a lie, apparently.
[57:24.14]I absolutely have.
[57:25.46]I've shit my pants over the age of 20.
[57:27.50]Don't believe this.
[57:29.92]I'm not trying to just be funny for the camera.
[57:33.72]Wait, Doc, can you take a look at this?
[57:36.34]Well, there's a certain percentage of accuracy in these tests, so that could explain...
[57:44.20]So I haven't shit my pants over 20?
[57:45.68]That says it's a lie.
[57:51.80]Have I?
[57:52.25]I don't think I have.
[57:53.45]Maybe I have.
[57:54.29]Yes, I have.
[57:54.91]I definitely have.
[57:56.43]I've made YouTube videos about this.
[57:58.45]Okay.
[57:59.57]Okay.
[58:00.09]It says it's a lie.
[58:00.97]God damn it.
[58:02.29]How the fuck would it know that?
[58:06.06]Alright.
[58:06.52]It's a lie.
[58:08.98]Do you hate your viewers?
[58:10.66]The answer I said was no.
[58:13.67]Truthful.
[58:15.19]I do not hate my viewers.
[58:16.87]Why would I?
[58:18.77]Yeah, I may have lied about shitting my pants, but I don't hate my viewers.
[58:21.77]Why would I hate my viewers?
[58:23.37]You guys are the reason why I can do this shit.
[58:28.16]Truthful.
[58:28.76]I do not hate my viewers.
[58:33.46]Have you ever shit your pants over 20?
[58:35.64]Do you hate your viewers?
[58:36.42]No.
[58:36.56]Okay, here we go.
[58:41.12]Do you secretly dab off stream?
[58:43.20]The answer is no.
[58:45.16]That was a lie.
[58:46.76]I have never fucking dabbed off stream.
[58:48.96]I have never dabbed off stream.
[58:51.60]Ever.
[58:52.32]I've never dabbed off stream.
[58:54.44]Doc.
[58:55.56]Doc, I've never dabbed off stream.
[58:57.40]Got it.
[58:58.49]So you've never dabbed off stream.
[58:59.69]But that's a lie.
[59:00.33]I said it was a lie.
[59:03.84]Okay.
[59:04.34]You know what?
[59:04.70]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:06.54]Hold on a second.
[59:07.56]God damn it.
[59:09.00]Fuck.
[59:09.93]I, you know, I may have, I may have dabbed after maybe once.
[59:13.01]Alright.
[59:15.91]God fucking give it.
[59:17.27]Explain it, I guess.
[59:19.51]You gotta be kidding me.
[59:22.09]You know, I may have done it as a joke to Etalyx one time as like a dumb joke.
[59:29.24]Now that pisses me off.
[59:30.44]That really does.
[59:32.47]Do you know what a dab is, Doc?
[59:34.29]I do not.
[59:34.95]It's a stupid... You go like this and you put your head down.
[59:38.63]It's stupid.
[59:39.36]It's like all the kids do it these days.
[59:41.66]I've never done it.
[59:42.38]And apparently I have.
[59:43.82]Alright.
[59:45.78]Now you know.
[59:46.94]Alright, let me like move this down.
[59:49.34]I screwed this up.
[59:50.10]I freaked out and punched this thing.
[59:53.33]I've never dabbed off stream.
[59:54.63]Of course I haven't.
[59:55.61]But that was a lie.
[59:56.33]Apparently I have.
[59:59.05]Okay.
[60:01.57]Next one.
[60:04.94]Do you think 80% of these are meme questions and are they dumb?
[60:09.12]I said yes.
[60:11.98]That was a lie.
[60:14.69]I did not actually believe that these were meme questions.
[60:18.25]I thought they were real questions, you know, and I tried to lie about it.
[60:22.41]It's a lie.
[60:24.49]You caught me, Doc.
[60:25.68]I guess so.
[60:27.74]It's that goddamn Jim Bean.
[60:29.12]Apparently it worked.
[60:32.62]Alright, keep going.
[60:35.29]This is such bullshit.
[60:38.97]What is your favorite trait of the community?
[60:40.93]I said sense of humor.
[60:42.45]That was a lie.
[60:47.38]But was it though?
[60:48.86]Was it actually a lie?
[60:52.94]What else did I say?
[60:53.68]Give me a break.
[60:57.02]I think you guys are funny.
[60:58.16]I really do.
[60:59.30]I do believe you guys are funny.
[61:03.65]No, you guys are funny.
[61:05.59]Give me a break.
[61:12.82]This is horse shit.
[61:16.72]I think you guys are funny, I really do.
[61:19.82]God damn it.
[61:23.16]$35,000 machine.
[61:24.48]That was a lie, apparently.
[61:25.38]Apparently I don't think that.
[61:32.15]Alright, almost halfway there.
[61:37.13]Keep going.
[61:38.85]Do I actually think my jokes are funny?
[61:41.61]Right?
[61:41.83]That was the question.
[61:43.99]I said yes.
[61:45.69]Truthful.
[61:47.61]I think I'm funny.
[61:48.35]Do you think I'm funny?
[61:49.67]I have to agree.
[61:51.81]Truthful.
[61:52.33]I really think that the shit I do is funny.
[61:54.85]Do you think this is funny?
[61:55.83]Because I do.
[62:01.35]Alright, yes, truthful.
[62:06.03]Are you currently being held hostage?
[62:09.05]I said no, and that was a lie.
[62:15.77]How is that a lie?
[62:16.93]Possibly by the machine.
[62:19.87]That's true.
[62:22.33]I'm being held hostage by the machine.
[62:23.75]There you go.
[62:24.57]Not this guy.
[62:26.23]I'm apparently being held hostage.
[62:28.19]There you go.
[62:29.33]How would you even get that from this?
[62:30.87]My breathing and... This thing is fucking crazy.
[62:34.73]It works, though.
[62:37.17]Are you embarrassed that you peed your pants today?
[62:40.51]I said yes.
[62:45.96]That was truthful.
[62:47.62]I did pee my pants today.
[62:49.50]Only a little bit, though.
[62:50.82]Only enough to be embarrassed by it.
[62:56.14]Not a whole underwear full of pee.
[62:58.60]But enough to be embarrassed.
[63:00.52]I didn't shake enough and it peed into my underwear.
[63:03.28]That was the truth.
[63:08.44]God damn it.
[63:09.08]I can't believe this is real.
[63:12.64]Have you actually looked up how to get taller?
[63:15.04]I said yes.
[63:17.22]But that was undetermined.
[63:19.42]As you can see.
[63:21.20]Undetermined.
[63:24.19]With undetermined, we have to consult the doctor.
[63:27.73]So have I actually looked up how to get taller?
[63:30.43]Well, it could have registered your feelings about it rather than whether you actually looked it up.
[63:38.98]So in my head, the answer is yes.
[63:41.74]Right.
[63:42.72]In your head.
[63:44.62]God's Grace, yes.
[63:45.54]Give me a break.
[63:46.22]Now we know.
[63:47.28]Now you know.
[63:50.36]Alright.
[63:50.85]Keep going.
[63:54.86]This is bullshit.
[63:55.82]This is bullshit.
[63:56.46]I don't even want to read this.
[63:59.10]Do you sit at a booster seat for every stream?
[64:01.48]I said no.
[64:05.01]That was a lie.
[64:07.09]I don't sit in a fucking booster seat.
[64:10.93]That's a... But I... I don't.
[64:12.75]I actually don't do that.
[64:17.37]Oh, God.
[64:17.99]The chat.
[64:18.47]I gotta... Hold on a second.
[64:21.41]I don't sit in a booster seat for... I'm sitting right here.
[64:25.13]Fucking goddammit.
[64:28.94]I don't sit in a booster seat.
[64:33.66]I don't sit... Fuck, believe what you want.
[64:39.89]Apparently I do.
[64:44.15]Fuck me.
[64:47.62]Have you purchased a clown car yet?
[64:49.30]I said no.
[64:50.04]That answer is undetermined.
[64:53.40]And with undetermined, we've got to get the doctor involved.
[64:55.98]Have I purchased a clown car?
[64:57.20]Are you thinking about it?
[64:58.91]I am.
[64:59.45]You know, you're right.
[64:59.99]I am thinking about it.
[65:01.71]There you go.
[65:02.21]It's up here.
[65:02.83]It's not currently down on paper.
[65:05.67]Maybe.
[65:06.35]You know, it's actually kind of crazy that all the undetermineds are like...
[65:13.61]In your head.
[65:14.17]Up here.
[65:14.89]They're in there.
[65:15.87]They're in there somewhere.
[65:16.93]That's insane.
[65:18.49]Yep.
[65:19.10]It's scary in there.
[65:22.08]Okay.
[65:23.30]Undetermined.
[65:23.88]What did you do with the real Jerma985?
[65:26.04]I said yes, but again, that's undetermined.
[65:33.26]There are quite a few of us.
[65:36.68]There has been at least three of us, so...
[65:38.97]Who knows who the fuck I really am for real?
[65:41.89]What do you think?
[65:42.42]Do I know where the real me is?
[65:43.56]Up here somewhere?
[65:47.60]Up there somewhere?
[65:49.54]Well, do any of us really know?
[65:53.06]That's a very good answer.
[65:55.58]Do any of us know who the real us is?
[65:57.50]There you go.
[65:59.16]Do you?
[66:00.66]Do you?
[66:02.40]A machine cannot determine that.
[66:04.67]A machine can't determine that?
[66:06.03]Are you guys serious?
[66:06.97]Give me a break.
[66:10.60]Do you hate chat memes?
[66:12.28]I said yes.
[66:16.83]Undetermined.
[66:17.29]What do you think?
[66:21.31]Judging by this ratio, what do you think?
[66:23.51]Do I hate the chat memes?
[66:26.70]Um...
[66:27.80]I wouldn't really determine that to be a real definite answer yes.
[66:35.53]I think that... I might hate some of them.
[66:39.35]Some of them?
[66:39.73]There you go.
[66:41.53]That's true.
[66:42.23]I hate some of them.
[66:43.41]I despise some of those memes, but I think some of them are actually kind of funny.
[66:47.75]Makes sense.
[66:50.71]Alright.
[66:51.29]Do you want kids?
[66:52.73]Again, this is undetermined.
[66:54.96]And that's funny because that's actually true.
[66:58.30]I don't really know if I want kids.
[67:01.98]Exactly.
[67:03.56]Yeah.
[67:05.16]That's so funny.
[67:08.82]Have you played Doki Doki Literature Club Offstream?
[67:12.65]I said no.
[67:14.73]That was truthful.
[67:16.33]I did not play that dumb fucking game.
[67:18.21]I'm not going to call it a dumb game.
[67:19.99]See?
[67:21.75]The question you want, that's truthful.
[67:23.45]I said no.
[67:25.89]You see that?
[67:27.71]This is a machine.
[67:28.31]This is a $65 trillion machine.
[67:30.37]It can't lie.
[67:32.83]I have not.
[67:35.69]Okay, here we go.
[67:38.28]Have you lied answering any of these questions?
[67:40.56]I said yes.
[67:42.38]Guess what?
[67:44.18]That was a lie.
[67:45.04]I answered all of them truthfully.
[67:47.66]I was just testing the fucking machine.
[67:49.52]That was a lie.
[67:52.52]I answered all the questions truthfully.
[67:54.48]All of them.
[67:56.59]Isn't that something?
[67:57.67]And it caught you right in the middle of a lie.
[68:03.49]Told you I'm the most goddamn transparent streamer there is.
[68:05.68]Alright, moving on.
[68:12.08]Is your next project on the main channel going to be Rat Movie 3?
[68:16.20]I said no.
[68:21.41]That was a lie.
[68:24.25]It is.
[68:28.62]These goddamn machines and their AI patterns.
[68:33.72]Yeah.
[68:35.38]It's true.
[68:36.92]It probably is.
[68:38.64]That's probably what it will be.
[68:41.20]The rats are saved.
[68:46.82]This is weird.
[68:47.38]This actually is pretty weird.
[68:50.58]Okay.
[68:52.44]Do you have a backup plan, job, aside from streaming?
[68:54.99]I said yes.
[68:56.03]Cryptocurrency.
[68:56.99]Oh yeah, trading.
[69:00.81]That was a lie.
[69:02.30]I got no fucking backup plan.
[69:05.54]Why is this so accurate?
[69:08.08]Why is this so accurate?
[69:10.30]Well, not completely.
[69:12.16]The tests are actually not 100%, but it can give you a really good picture of what you might not know.
[69:20.77]I got no fucking backup plan.
[69:22.17]Are you guys serious?
[69:23.55]It's just this.
[69:27.64]Uh, was that really a picture of your asshole in the Firewatch YouTube video?
[69:32.54]I said no.
[69:36.44]That was a lie, apparently.
[69:39.84]That's not even possible.
[69:42.29]That was not a picture of my asshole in that video.
[69:44.39]It wasn't.
[69:46.71]Oh my god.
[69:48.81]It was a picture.
[69:49.31]I took a picture.
[69:50.03]Look.
[69:51.73]I took a picture of bread and I put it in the video.
[69:54.17]It wasn't... Bread.
[69:55.81]Okay.
[69:56.03]I got a picture of bread from Google and I put it in the video and it was funny.
[69:59.64]Okay.
[70:00.30]I believe you, baby.
[70:02.24]Bread.
[70:03.10]That was not my asshole.
[70:06.18]Oh, my God.
[70:08.44]Alright.
[70:09.22]Are you a furry?
[70:10.06]I said no.
[70:10.77]That is truthful.
[70:12.35]Take a look at that.
[70:13.25]Not a furry.
[70:18.00]Machine doesn't lie.
[70:20.06]Not a furry.
[70:20.44]In case you guys really wanted to know.
[70:25.92]And following up, does your mom know that you are a furry?
[70:28.90]I said no.
[70:29.60]That was apparently a lie.
[70:36.22]Well, listen.
[70:36.92]Alright, listen.
[70:38.64]Why would... Alright, you got to chime in here.
[70:41.66]Why would my mother know that I'm a furry?
[70:46.85]Well, how would she know that?
[70:48.22]First of all, I don't know your mother.
[70:50.40]Right.
[70:50.82]Okay.
[70:51.56]So we got to start there.
[70:53.24]But to be honest with you, it's a kind of a backwards twist there because you gave, if you gave the right answer to the question and then you answered a question that had to be a lie, then that's a bit of a twist, isn't it?
[71:08.63]Right.
[71:09.01]And very confusing.
[71:10.07]It probably confused you.
[71:12.85]So my mother, yes, that's true.
[71:15.09]That's a lie that my mother doesn't know I'm a furry, but I'm not a furry, so how could I even answer that question?
[71:20.35]Take that as you will.
[71:21.15]I'm not a furry.
[71:22.99]I answered that already.
[71:23.81]That was the last question.
[71:25.21]My mother doesn't know, but how am I supposed to even answer that without going down weird paths here?
[71:32.15]Okay, is the polygraph operator cute?
[71:34.66]I said yes.
[71:35.60]Oh no.
[71:49.87]You know, he's fucking cute, alright?
[71:52.49]He's a handsome man.
[71:54.85]It says it's a lie, but don't... I don't think I'm going to touch this.
[72:11.74]You're a handsome man.
[72:13.02]Thank you.
[72:13.58]You are.
[72:14.94]You are definitely a handsome man.
[72:16.86]Machine is not 100%.
[72:17.46]What can I say?
[72:17.90]Yeah.
[72:20.44]Am I afraid of my projects on the main channel or big projects letting my audience down?
[72:25.84]I said no.
[72:28.61]That was for real.
[72:30.43]I am not worried about letting you guys down.
[72:32.33]What do you think?
[72:34.79]I don't think I know I got the best shit on twitch.tv.
[72:43.06]I'm ready.
[72:43.62]I'm good.
[72:44.18]Don't worry.
[72:45.22]I'm not concerned about it.
[72:49.18]What is really delaying you making you a late streamer?
[72:52.12]I said I sleep too much.
[72:57.63]That was a lie.
[72:59.71]And it was.
[73:01.99]I'm just not prepared a lot of the times.
[73:03.67]You know what I mean?
[73:07.83]That was a lie.
[73:08.58]You caught me in a lie.
[73:10.32]It's not sleeping.
[73:11.30]It's not because I slept too long.
[73:15.52]I'm just not ready half the time.
[73:16.72]Really.
[73:17.16]Really.
[73:18.87]That's the case.
[73:23.15]Is... God damn it.
[73:26.46]Is Elbertson truly your family name?
[73:29.40]I said yes.
[73:29.88]Lie.
[73:34.09]Lie.
[73:47.31]would that even know that seriously I try whatever it doesn't matter it doesn't fucking matter I don't care who cares who cares next question bullshit have you been flossing your teeth I said no and yes I fucking floss that was a lie I floss my teeth every day up in here into here you gotta floss that was a lie I do floss good machine test
[74:17.82]This thing is actually very accurate, as strange as that is.
[74:20.92]Thank you for letting us use it.
[74:22.46]Certainly.
[74:24.18]Next is a... Have you been drinking your brain fluid?
[74:28.59]I said no, that's a lie.
[74:30.11]But I don't even know what that... What does that question even mean?
[74:33.33]Have I been drinking my brain fluid?
[74:37.01]I made one joke six months ago.
[74:39.80]How can I not... I don't even know what you... What are you even talking about here?
[74:43.84]What does that even mean?
[74:44.34]I don't even know what that means.
[74:47.80]So apparently I am drinking my brain fluid from time to time.
[74:52.28]You know what?
[74:53.14]That might be true.
[74:55.42]Okay.
[74:55.54]Well, because I drink like a supplemental tea every day.
[74:59.10]I drink like a good tea every day.
[75:00.60]Maybe my brain, I'm replacing that with that.
[75:07.35]I said, am I tired of peel, peel, peeling potatoes?
[75:10.39]I said, yes.
[75:11.07]This is a non-question.
[75:16.22]That was a lie.
[75:17.14]I'm not tired of it.
[75:20.03]How are you even supposed to answer that question?
[75:23.05]That makes no sense.
[75:24.95]Are you tired of peel, peel, peeling potatoes?
[75:27.07]What a terrible question.
[75:28.43]I'm glad I lied on it.
[75:32.69]Alright, is Otto a giant rat in disguise?
[75:34.63]I said no, that was a lie, but he's a dog.
[75:38.91]He's a dog.
[75:39.67]He's just a dog.
[75:40.63]He's not a...
[75:42.94]Why would my body lie about that?
[75:45.36]That makes no sense.
[75:48.80]Does that make no sense?
[75:49.88]It might be sort of an insignificant question to you.
[75:53.50]Right.
[75:56.97]Why would that even... Almost at the end.
[76:01.87]Who is your favorite comedian?
[76:03.15]I said Bill Burr.
[76:04.75]You know, this is undetermined.
[76:08.50]I actually don't.
[76:09.58]I mean, that was a kind of quick question.
[76:11.06]I don't know.
[76:12.27]Bill Burr?
[76:16.27]Jim Carrey?
[76:18.63]I had a couple of answers here, so I can see how that would be undetermined.
[76:22.65]So that would make some sense, right?
[76:24.31]Like, my brain can't come to a conclusion.
[76:26.95]Right.
[76:31.00]This is bullshit.
[76:32.96]No, it's not.
[76:33.66]Is it?
[76:35.81]Did you ever actually have a sponsorship at one point?
[76:38.02]I said no.
[76:39.52]That's a lie.
[76:40.24]But I didn't have a spon- What?
[76:43.56]What if I had a sponsorship?
[76:46.94]Alright.
[76:48.34]Okay.
[76:48.94]You know what?
[76:51.67]I gotta complain here.
[76:53.21]Right?
[76:53.35]You gotta complain if you get caught.
[76:55.11]There you go.
[76:58.57]I played Fairway Solitaire one time.
[77:01.27]And I told everybody to go get it.
[77:02.78]And that was a sponsored video.
[77:03.72]That was the only one I ever done.
[77:04.52]That was like six years ago.
[77:10.83]you got me one time whatever that's I've never had a sponsor whatever did you cancel the glue man animated series I said yes that's a lie but was it though I mean like I did but it's not it's not actively in development right now so what happens if you if your brain lies but your mouth doesn't what does that mean
[77:38.38]Does it mean like I'm scared of what people would have to say?
[77:41.74]Yeah.
[77:42.56]That could be the determination on it.
[77:45.46]Sure.
[77:46.98]Yeah.
[77:48.62]It's funny how actually accurate this actually is.
[77:51.31]It's funny.
[77:53.83]Technology.
[77:54.93]Yeah.
[77:55.99]Okay.
[77:56.31]Do you want us to give you money?
[77:57.55]I said no.
[78:02.37]Undetermined.
[78:06.10]I don't want you to give me money, but...
[78:09.03]Look, that's undetermined, which, you know, people can give money with bits and subscriptions, but what is undetermined means that I don't necessarily want it, but I'll take it.
[78:20.65]It would have been kind of difficult to say no on that one completely.
[78:26.13]Right.
[78:26.47]Undetermined.
[78:27.42]That's pretty accurate.
[78:28.60]Yeah.
[78:29.50]Look at that.
[78:29.96]Okay.
[78:32.80]A couple more questions and that's it.
[78:38.48]How do you sleep at night?
[78:39.44]And I said no, which is I don't sleep very well.
[78:45.14]That was a lie.
[78:49.09]But I don't sleep that well.
[78:50.93]I sleep a lot.
[78:52.75]I sleep too much.
[78:55.49]Do I sleep too much?
[78:56.13]What do you think?
[78:57.35]Is it too much or too little?
[78:58.53]We should perhaps have put in a yes on that.
[79:01.47]Because you were answering a question.
[79:04.70]you were answering the question that you don't sleep well at night, but would be affirmative about your answer, then we probably should put in a yes on that.
[79:15.18]Right.
[79:15.62]So that would explain.
[79:16.52]So what happened here?
[79:17.14]Look at this.
[79:18.32]Did I like turn off right here?
[79:21.02]What happened here?
[79:22.98]Yeah, well, I guess you could say it's just a bunch of high peaks, so.
[79:27.09]Right.
[79:27.73]Yeah, it's, yeah.
[79:31.09]That may be why the machine is interpreting that as a lie as well.
[79:34.93]Okay.
[79:37.09]And then the last one, that was it.
[79:41.22]That's the last one.
[79:44.34]That's all the questions answered.
[79:46.00]All your questions have been successfully answered.
[79:52.57]You guys want to like just go completely just free ball it?
[79:57.87]What do you think?
[80:00.49]Random chat questions while we're on just experience mode?

[80:16.80]And you can determine if they're lies or not, okay?
[80:22.53]I'm sorry?
[80:23.39]Say that again?
[80:23.99]So what we're going to do on like just freelance mode?
[80:26.82]Oh, okay.
[80:27.58]And you can determine if it was a lie or not.

[80:37.18]Alright, here we go.
[80:38.78]Open interrogation.

[80:46.79]And I'm going to open the chat on my phone and we're going to read random questions.
[80:50.35]And you can, by your own admission, determine if they're truthful or not.
[80:53.45]Okay.
[80:53.65]Let me open up the chat.
[81:06.49]This is your last opportunity to ask questions.
[81:08.73]Okay, let's connect it again.
[81:18.06]Connecting up here, yep.
[81:24.32]Get that situated.
[81:25.54]Alright.
[81:27.52]It's a waste.
[81:32.12]I'm going back in.
[81:38.41]We've been going for an hour and 20 minutes.
[81:40.65]Jesus.
[81:42.17]Short session.
[81:44.95]Get me back in here.
[81:51.71]So I'm going to pick out random questions.
[81:53.02]Lightning round.
[81:55.79]And it's up to him to determine if it's true or not.
[81:58.97]At his discretion.
[82:00.45]I'm ready.
[82:01.61]Ready.
[82:02.55]Let me just get this one on my finger here.
[82:08.57]And on the index, right?
[82:10.27]Yeah.

[82:16.62]Okay.
[82:23.58]Alright.
[82:26.21]Let's see.
[82:27.91]So the question here.
[82:29.01]Wait, why am I opening a TF2 video?
[82:31.97]Why did that happen?
[82:33.57]Here we go.
[82:36.63]Alright.
[82:37.67]You can hit the resume button, I guess.
[82:39.97]Are you ready?
[82:40.81]Got that going.
[82:43.11]Okay.
[82:46.13]I'm ready.
[82:48.87]Random questions from the chat room.
[82:52.60]What do you got?
[82:59.17]Apparently I can't see them on here, so I'm going to move.
[83:01.05]I'm going to scooch closer.
[83:05.79]You're going to get a bad reading here.
[83:08.80]Okay.
[83:09.46]Alright.
[83:11.32]I'm ready.
[83:14.44]What is my biggest fear?
[83:15.90]You ready?
[83:21.94]Drowning.
[83:27.84]Let's see.
[83:30.80]Give me a minute here.
[83:31.72]I want to... Drowning.
[83:37.53]Drowning?
[83:40.95]Well, it certainly brings up a lot for you, so I would say yes.
[83:49.40]It's true.
[83:50.38]I'm terrified of drowning, especially in somebody's pool.
[83:53.36]Yeah.
[83:57.96]Did you really die in Jerma Rumble?
[83:59.98]No, I'm right here.
[84:01.56]I'm alive right now.
[84:04.02]Yeah.
[84:04.48]Do you even need me to ask that question?
[84:06.78]We're here already.
[84:07.52]What have we got?
[84:11.25]Anymore?
[84:15.63]Liar!
[84:16.05]What do you mean, liar?
[84:19.71]Am I afraid of death?
[84:21.53]Yes.
[84:24.63]Yeah.
[84:25.78]Yep, that machine agrees.
[84:28.52]Everyone's afraid of death.
[84:29.52]Who's not afraid of dying?
[84:33.98]Are you actually from Boston or is your entire life a ruse?
[84:37.93]I was born in Boston and grew up in the Boston area.
[84:43.19]Hang on.
[84:45.89]Just a second on that one.
[84:49.13]Yes.
[84:49.93]Thank you.
[84:51.39]Thank you.
[84:52.25]Real time.
[84:53.31]Real time answers here.
[84:56.22]Is JermaCraft ever going to return?
[84:58.54]No.
[85:02.22]Correct.
[85:03.32]Thank you.
[85:04.18]Thank you.
[85:05.74]It will never return.
[85:10.53]Do you miss Star?
[85:13.03]I miss all my friends.
[85:13.99]Yes.
[85:14.19]Of course I do.
[85:19.13]Yep.
[85:21.55]Look at that.
[85:22.53]It's real.
[85:24.36]Am I wearing a wig?
[85:25.86]No.
[85:28.90]Yeah, this is where the machine works correctly because it definitely agrees with the no on that.
[85:36.18]I don't have a fucking wig on.
[85:38.38]I can't pull this.
[85:40.12]You guys, seriously.
[85:41.01]Alright, last one.
[85:44.33]Two more.
[85:50.53]Am I good at basketball?
[85:52.07]No.
[85:52.59]I'm terrible at basketball.
[85:54.10]Not even close.
[85:56.06]Hang on.
[86:01.99]Truthful answer.
[86:03.13]Thank you.
[86:04.43]Not very good at basketball.
[86:08.05]Is the stream pre-recorded?
[86:10.27]No.
[86:11.33]This is happening right now.
[86:14.44]Correct.
[86:16.08]See?
[86:16.32]You think I'm going to pre-record this stream?
[86:20.36]No way.
[86:21.02]Not in a million years.
[86:24.07]Do I drink toilet water?
[86:25.55]No.
[86:31.10]Correct, but it did make you a little nervous.
[86:36.56]I've never drank toilet water.
[86:39.16]It's just a weird question.
[86:40.36]It's a strange question to have to answer.
[86:44.50]Do I like Aquaman?
[86:46.49]No, I don't.
[86:49.91]Hang on.
[86:55.64]Uh, yeah.
[86:56.54]That was truthful.
[86:57.28]He sucks.
[86:58.30]He's the worst Marvel hero.
[87:00.21]What is it, DC?
[87:01.29]Yeah.
[87:01.73]Aquaman's DC?
[87:02.75]I believe so.
[87:04.37]Oh, I'm wearing the Aquaman shirt.
[87:07.13]This character sucks.
[87:07.99]Who cares?
[87:10.99]Uh, have I ever taken an IQ test?
[87:12.66]Yes, and it's up.
[87:13.40]Okay.
[87:14.28]My IQ was 124.
[87:14.92]Hang on.
[87:15.12]Right again.
[87:15.58]See?
[87:15.82]See?
[87:25.16]See?
[87:27.00]And I am the smartest person that I know.
[87:32.58]I think you might have gone off the charts on that one a little.
[87:35.88]That might have been a little bit of a lie.
[87:38.46]Okay.
[87:40.30]I know a lot of smart people.
[87:41.52]I know a lot of smart people.
[87:43.24]So it makes sense.
[87:44.10]Of course it does.
[87:45.38]124 IQ though.
[87:46.34]Fucking proven.
[87:47.07]Hooked up to a goddamn machine.
[87:56.90]Do I play Fortnite off stream?
[87:58.74]Absolutely not.
[88:00.70]No.
[88:03.06]Alright, you got it.
[88:04.00]Yep.
[88:04.44]See, you guys, you can't lie.
[88:06.42]This isn't canon.
[88:12.98]Yes, it is.
[88:13.90]I'm hooked up to a machine.
[88:14.94]It has to be canon.
[88:22.47]Is God real?
[88:25.69]I can't even answer that question.
[88:26.87]I don't know.
[88:30.39]Yep.
[88:31.69]Yep.
[88:32.07]Indetermined.
[88:32.87]Indetermined, see?
[88:33.50]I don't know.
[88:34.08]How am I supposed to know that?
[88:36.80]And, let's see.
[88:38.02]Somebody said, I gotta make sure I'm ready for this.
[88:43.48]Do you wish you were actually taller?
[88:48.37]No.
[88:54.35]Hold on.
[88:58.94]I would say that was a truthful answer.
[89:04.19]What did you say?
[89:04.71]Say it again.
[89:06.11]Truthful answer.
[89:08.17]Fucking tall enough.
[89:14.07]And have I ever murdered anybody?
[89:16.35]No.
[89:20.46]Kind of all over the place, but I think that comes out as a truthful answer.
[89:25.08]Good.
[89:26.82]Alright, last one.
[89:27.56]That's a lie.
[89:40.44]I'm not going to answer how big something is, okay?
[89:50.91]I didn't kill anybody.
[89:54.03]Do I have any tattoos?
[89:55.33]No.
[89:59.76]You're telling the truth.
[90:00.92]See, I don't have any fucking tattoos.
[90:06.46]Alright, I'm not gonna, everyone keeps asking about it.
[90:08.86]I'm not gonna answer that question.
[90:09.94]It's very lewd and disrespectful.
[90:13.30]12 inches.
[90:16.90]Hang on.
[90:22.76]Yeah, I think it's truthful.
[90:26.51]See?
[90:26.85]I don't even need any more questions.
[90:29.64]That's it.
[90:30.44]Do you understand?
[90:32.34]Do you understand I don't need any more questions after that one?
[90:37.99]Get this thing off me.
[90:41.39]Oh, boy, that's expensive.
[90:44.39]That's a truthful answer.
[90:45.83]You got what you wanted.
[90:46.97]That's what you came for.
[90:50.50]But anyways.
[90:52.71]I can't see any money that anybody gave, but I do want to thank Dr. Schweickson.
[90:58.79]Yes.
[90:58.97]That was very fun.
[91:01.09]Hopefully you guys got some answers to your questions that you had, and see you guys tomorrow or the next day.
[91:09.09]This is what you guys decided to ask.
[91:11.67]I didn't decide.
[91:13.42]I just brought a goddamn doctor in here.
[91:17.56]Good night.
[91:18.34]Massive streamer.
[91:22.98]You can't lie when you hooked it to a fucking machine.
[91:25.43]And this is an accredited doctor.
[91:27.65]This is a doctor.
[91:29.83]You understand?
[91:32.63]He's got his medical license.
[91:33.71]He's got his accredited polygraph license.
[91:42.19]See you later.
[91:43.81]Thank you again to Dr. Spikeson.
[91:45.75]Okay.
[91:46.33]He was a perfect, perfect, perfect fun man.
[91:48.63]For sure.
[91:49.89]And yes, it said I lied, but I didn't.
[91:53.57]a reverse lied about how he was a very handsome man.
[91:57.11]Understand?
[91:59.61]See you later guys.
[92:00.85]Good night.
[92:01.29]It's fucking bullshit.
[92:08.14]This whole thing, like the whole thing about dabbing on stream.
[92:10.96]Yeah.
[92:13.24]Yeah.
[92:13.48]We're going to get that thing checked out.
[92:14.66]Like that thing's fucking bullshit.
[92:16.40]Yeah?
[92:17.02]Yeah, like, oh, I'm dabbing on stream.
[92:18.80]No, I've never dabbed on stream in my whole life.
[92:21.26]Except one time, some fucking idiot was here, and he stayed, like, a couple nights.
[92:26.10]And he was like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna dab on stream.
[92:28.00]He was a good shit-faced.
[92:28.78]He was fucking stupid.
[92:29.50]Get the thing checked.
[92:30.58]Was it $4,000?
[92:31.26]I don't know.
[92:33.66]Yeah, it's fucking worthless.
[92:34.94]The thing sucks.
[92:39.56]Oh, shit.
[92:43.32]Hmm.
