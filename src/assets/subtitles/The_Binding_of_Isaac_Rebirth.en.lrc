[00:16.44]Oh no, I can't see my chat.
[00:18.27]Ah, there we go.
[01:27.77]Good morning, everybody
[01:49.69]I'm going to play some Isaac in a little bit, in a few minutes.
[01:52.24]A minute or two.
[02:28.90]What's going on with my chat?
[02:30.00]What's happening to it?
[02:37.04]There we go.
[02:37.32]Alright, let's just get into this.
[02:47.69]Good morning.
[02:57.31]There we go.
[02:59.25]Okay, so, uh, good morning, everybody.
[03:01.27]Hi, how are you?
[03:02.11]Welcome to, uh, another stream.
[03:12.78]Look at that win streak.
[03:14.94]Negative 11.
[03:15.54]Wow.
[03:16.36]Yeah, I haven't played in a long time.
[03:22.08]I think I know, well, that's not true.
[03:25.63]I played like yesterday, just walking around and dying.
[03:32.36]But I have played this game quite a lot.
[03:35.67]And obviously there's the new big gigantic update.
[03:40.23]It's going to be here in like a month and a half or so.
[03:42.03]And it's piqued my interest again.
[03:46.70]Mr. McMillan and all of his great additions.
[03:51.68]So, I don't know.
[03:52.36]I guess I'll just... I'm just going to do Isaac, I guess.
[03:56.44]Seems like the safest bet on hard.
[04:01.80]Curse of Darkness, right off the bat.
[04:03.80]We do have an item room.
[04:05.71]And it's the Shattered Fackin' Mirror, dude.
[04:09.89]Boomerang Tears, that's cool.
[04:13.09]Hey, can you believe it?
[04:14.13]How many of you guys can believe that this is the second stream in a row?
[04:21.57]I haven't done, I have not done two streams in a row, two days in a row, in probably two years.
[04:29.68]I really think that's true.
[04:31.86]If anybody can have the research to figure that out, I really don't think I've done this in at least two and a half years.
[04:40.75]One thing I'm realizing right now though, I do need to get my monitor over on my left.
[04:46.83]Because that's much easier.
[04:47.94]Because right now I'm looking to my right to see chat.
[04:52.64]It's not the most ideal.
[04:53.70]My eyes are bad.
[04:55.28]I need like a... I need a screen to my left here.
[04:58.64]That would make things much easier.
[05:07.09]Isaac?
[05:09.29]Alright, let's see if I remember everything about this game.
[05:11.73]I know you can use bombs.
[05:16.39]That's about all I do remember.
[05:19.64]I'm just kidding.
[05:20.46]I know plenty about this game.
[05:24.76]Could do without the darkness, though.
[05:26.02]Okay.
[05:40.41]Secret room, secret room.
[05:43.25]There's a lot of places where the secret room could be.
[05:44.91]Yeah, my eyes have always been bad.
[05:51.95]I actually got prescribed glasses.
[05:53.53]Alright, we're going to do it.
[05:55.05]It was worth it.
[05:56.69]Oh yeah, that was worth it.
[05:59.53]Give me all those gold coins.
[06:02.97]Yeah, I got prescribed glasses in the 6th grade.
[06:07.58]And, like, not just like, oh, you might need these glasses.
[06:12.19]No, no, no.
[06:12.57]I, like, I need glasses.
[06:15.55]And after the sixth grade, I think I wore them, like, three times.
[06:20.53]And then they made me want to throw up, so I couldn't wear them anymore.
[06:23.63]And I can't wear contacts.
[06:25.29]Because when I wear contacts, I have extremely sensitive eyeballs.
[06:28.47]And, like, I'm one of those people that when it's a windy out, when it's even just a little bit windy, tears are streaming down my face.
[06:37.39]That's the type of eye sensitivity I have.
[06:40.27]I'm really sensitive to light with my eyes, too.
[06:42.15]I don't know if anybody in here is a doctor.
[06:45.37]What does that mean?
[06:48.54]You get, like, extremely sens- Oh, jeez.
[06:52.60]I hate super quick weapon.
[06:53.92]And I can't even get the hearts.
[06:56.60]I can't get any of these hearts, huh?
[07:01.18]Shit.
[07:05.40]It's always really embarrassing, too, if it's even slightly windy out and I'm out somewhere and I'm doing something.
[07:10.69]It looks like something really bad happened and people are like, Oh my god, what happened?
[07:15.11]Oh, look at this.
[07:15.66]Oh, he's crying.
[07:16.54]Something must be bothering him.
[07:18.52]It's like, no, my eyes just suck.
[07:24.08]I'm actually kind of happy right now.
[07:25.61]It's just my eyes are assholes.
[07:30.27]Safety cap.
[07:31.39]See, here's the problem if I play this game again for an extended period of time.
[07:36.14]I forget what all these trinkets do.
[07:39.82]I need Boo.
[07:42.22]Every time, back in the day when I played Isaac all the time, Boo was my Wikipedia.
[07:48.74]I'd be like, Boo, I picked up the safety cap, what's it do?
[07:51.32]And he'd be like, well, I'll tell ya.
[07:54.02]Safety cap gives you 5% more damage.
[07:57.04]And I'd be like, Boo, please just keep talking.
[08:00.43]Because I love hearing you talk.
[08:04.71]Secret room.
[08:04.95]We're going to go for it.
[08:05.87]I bet it's right here.
[08:10.90]Hey.
[08:11.08]At least I got the bomb back.
[08:17.38]So it's more pills.
[08:18.20]Okay, cool.
[08:19.25]You guys can be my Wikipedia.
[08:24.15]Hey, look at that.
[08:24.79]Balls of steel.
[08:25.31]I wish I could see.
[08:32.28]Ah, Boo is not dead.
[08:33.16]Boo is very much alive.
[08:37.27]Super secret room.
[08:38.25]I don't think I have enough... No, whatever.
[08:40.83]Actually, are there hearts?
[08:41.93]I can't get them.
[08:42.45]Well, actually, now I can.
[08:44.03]I can now.
[08:44.83]I think it might be worth it.
[08:46.53]Because I'm bad.
[08:52.84]Actually, I talk to Boo very, very, very frequently.
[08:55.98]I talk to Boo, like, every day.
[08:58.54]Ah, shit.
[08:58.90]I thought there were rocks in here at this moment.
[09:13.34]No, it's not worth doing that again.
[09:16.92]You know what?
[09:17.38]Maybe I should just get one of those things like the chats on the screen and I can actually read it.
[09:23.48]Gurglings!
[09:27.54]These guys are kind of a pain in the ass.
[09:32.65]I like mom's mirror, but it kind of scares me a little bit, because I keep, for some reason, thinking... I'm not mother, but that it shatters mirror, whatever it is.
[09:39.21]I think... I keep thinking those are enemy missiles coming at me.
[09:45.86]I'm trying to, like, dodge my own missiles.
[09:53.18]Come on, go away, red stuff.
[10:00.42]Will one of you go away?
[10:01.35]What the hell?
[10:03.77]I have not been able to get rid of one of them yet.
[10:05.93]Holy crap.
[10:07.11]Bully.
[10:07.62]I need damage.
[10:14.06]Bad.
[10:18.76]There we go.
[10:23.03]Good enough.
[10:24.39]Let's continue.
[10:30.29]How are you?
[10:31.07]Explain your life to us.
[10:35.59]Well, not much.
[10:38.12]Not much to talk about.
[10:42.42]I woke up this morning.
[10:44.44]Took auto.
[10:44.96]I didn't even see that guy.
[10:48.40]I have no idea what my health is either.
[10:49.71]That's not good.
[10:51.69]Took auto for a walk.
[10:54.07]Met some of my neighbors.
[10:56.65]Seemed like pretty nice people.
[10:59.34]Went to Dunkin' Donuts, got a coffee.
[11:02.22]Came back, sat down, and turned this on.
[11:05.04]That's pretty much my life right now.
[11:06.96]That's like what I did today.
[11:07.80]I thought these guys still have a couple of frames when they go down.
[11:14.08]Yeah, they do.
[11:27.95]Get away from me.
[11:30.98]Chocolate pudding.
[11:33.00]Get away from me, you delicious chocolate pudding.
[11:35.36]That's gross.
[11:46.17]Who was the guy in the overflowing backpack video?
[11:50.05]Oh, that's a buddy of mine.
[11:54.62]Kind of like a friend of a friend, sort of.
[12:00.13]I shouldn't have picked that up.
[12:01.64]I actually didn't even really see it.
[12:03.52]I ended up seeing it the last second.
[12:05.00]I have keys, right?
[12:06.12]Yeah, three.
[12:09.88]Fear shot.
[12:12.02]I have all these interesting things.
[12:14.45]I just don't know.
[12:32.34]How's the new house?
[12:32.90]It's great.
[12:34.62]It's great.
[12:35.60]Of all, like, the pain and suffering that I had to go through to actually get into this place and live here, like, I'm actually, like, living here now.
[12:45.07]It was worth it.
[12:46.35]It didn't seem like it as things were going along there, but it's worth it, man.
[12:53.45]Your own space, your own place.
[12:57.67]I mean, I lived on my own before.
[13:00.62]But not like this.
[13:06.72]Are you going to make videos of Overwatch?
[13:20.54]I mean, I... That's... That's like a... Yeah.
[13:24.64]I mean, if it's good.
[13:26.30]Which it is.
[13:26.76]At least from what I've played.
[13:32.57]And it has the legendary Jeff Kaplan designing it.
[13:37.05]It'll be alright.
[13:38.73]It'll be good.
[13:44.84]I'm actually glad he's just stuck doing this.
[13:47.40]Because he's just not a threat at all.
[13:51.07]Dog food.
[13:56.34]Oh, come on.
[13:59.00]That's not cool.
[14:00.66]I forget this guy's patterns.
[14:01.72]Doesn't he do a quadruple quadrilaser?
[14:06.82]He does.
[14:09.40]At some point.
[14:16.09]Come on, do it.
[14:21.43]What?
[14:21.63]I dodged that.
[14:24.97]At least I get the... Oh, boy.
[14:27.16]This thing is incredible.
[14:37.67]Yeah, I've only played Overwatch two times.
[14:41.93]Once at Blizzard and then once at...
[14:45.96]Pax?
[14:46.20]What was the... It was Pax, right?
[14:47.62]Pax East?
[14:48.20]My brain... Guys, I don't even remember.
[14:51.72]I've played it two times in two separate places.
[14:54.84]I think.
[14:55.56]Yes.
[14:55.90]No, I have.
[15:03.54]The two different times I've played it has been... I don't think it's worth... You know what?
[15:10.77]Screw it.
[15:11.29]Let's get it.
[15:12.77]Might be something really good.
[15:15.00]Nope.
[15:17.79]In fact, I don't even know how much health I have.
[15:19.61]I need to be really careful here, because I could end up just taking one hit and die.
[15:22.49]I do not want that to happen, so... Oh, boy.
[15:42.12]Doesn't this do something interesting?
[15:51.96]Are you still doing voice acting work?
[15:53.98]Yeah.
[15:55.24]I actually just completed a major character in a game coming up.
[16:02.69]So, that was really fun.
[16:07.21]It's the first time I've been, like, cast as a, like, more major character in a game.
[16:13.43]I was a major character in, like, an iPad game, but this is, like, a Steam release game.
[16:18.46]The developers are, like, known and they make good stuff.
[16:24.02]Just stores red hearts.
[16:27.44]I think I'm going to be the scrub and buy a heart because I just digest.
[16:33.20]I'm scared.
[16:33.68]I just don't know.
[16:34.54]I don't know how many hearts I have right now.
[16:43.92]Ooh.
[16:44.98]Is that it?
[16:46.12]Is this tinted?
[16:46.56]Do I have any bombs?
[16:49.92]Is there any bombs in the shop?
[16:51.07]Yeah, there are.
[16:58.37]I can never tell.
[17:01.76]It's got the X on it, right?
[17:02.70]Doesn't that mean it?
[17:04.12]My eyes.
[17:05.30]I think that, yeah, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:07.00]That's tinted rock.
[17:08.08]If I've ever seen one in my life.
[17:12.59]range up and damage up that was worth it that was absolutely worth it when are you gonna get a girlfriend hey don't rush me don't rush me I don't have any uh no bombs to check for any secret
[17:40.27]Am I Australian?
[17:42.31]I mean, don't think so.
[17:47.36]I probably would talk a little bit differently if I was.
[17:55.46]Watch out for the turkey.
[17:58.46]Always gotta be careful of the turkeys, especially if they catch on fire.
[18:03.81]So now, remember what I said before?
[18:05.59]How my bullets or my missiles are kind of like... I can't determine when they're not mine or not.
[18:12.09]It's even harder now because they're red.
[18:14.39]So that's going to be a nightmare.
[18:18.29]Make a prediction right now.
[18:19.25]This is what's going to get me killed.
[18:20.39]Because I'm going to think this is shooting at me.
[18:22.09]And I'm going to run into something else.
[18:23.83]Guarantee it.
[18:36.71]Have I ever dated somebody that was super fucking weird?
[18:40.81]Uh, no, but the people that have dated me have dated somebody that's super fucking weird, so... Maybe you could ask them that question.
[18:52.58]Because they've dated me.
[18:53.82]I'm pretty fucking weird.
[18:59.45]So, no.
[19:00.62]You know, my goal here, my goal in life is to find a girl that's equally as fucking weird as I am.
[19:08.36]And we can just both be weirdos.
[19:11.28]And that's it.
[19:12.26]Happily ever after.
[19:13.02]Rapunzel.
[19:15.28]She has the hair and a guy climbs up it.
[19:18.06]Isn't that what happens?
[19:18.94]Something like that.
[19:30.15]personal and you don't have to answer but do you still struggle with finding happiness every day I think that's a struggle that all of us can attribute to I aim to make I can't get this I aim to make myself happy every day but sometimes you just can't and that's something you just have to remember is sometimes you just fucking can't and it's alright you don't gotta be like super smiley man every day
[20:02.54]Everybody's got problems.
[20:04.04]Everybody's got stuff that they deal with.
[20:07.74]Just remember that you're not alone.
[20:17.24]I mean, don't take that as... I'm depressed or anything like that.
[20:21.55]It's just... Everybody struggles with that kind of thing.
[20:24.91]It's just life.
[20:32.56]Magicians.
[20:34.22]That stupid little fly has blocked so many of those shots.
[20:46.13]Probably should be utilizing.
[20:47.01]I'm scared to use it because it takes so long to recharge.
[20:49.39]Usually I use it for bosses.
[20:53.07]I'm going to use it here.
[20:55.18]That was a not cool room, so.
[21:00.81]I would have packed a lunch if I knew that you would take me on a field trip.
[21:07.31]No, that wasn't meant to be like a play sad music, like field trip.
[21:17.99]I like that one.
[21:18.79]I like that.
[21:19.61]I'm going to use that.
[21:23.13]I will attribute it.
[21:24.13]I will credit you.
[21:26.40]I will say that to somebody, and then I will say your username with a copyright next to it.
[21:42.83]Have I played through the new Metal Gear yet?
[21:45.29]No.
[21:48.71]I still don't understand the whole story, but you don't really have to.
[21:56.65]I want to do this thing where I played through every single Metal Gear again.
[22:01.09]Because I played the first two all the way through.
[22:06.27]And I just forgot everything.
[22:10.37]And when I started making that video and playing through things, like Metal Gear Solid 4, on my PS3, I played through pretty much all those games.
[22:23.43]But, like, half-assed because I was trying to record cutscenes.
[22:30.93]At least for Metal Gear Solid 4 and 3 and, uh... Oh, shit.
[22:37.28]Oh, shit.
[22:37.96]Don't kill me.
[22:40.50]Like, Metal Gear Solid 4, in particular, I never really got a chance to ever even see it.
[22:44.51]And I was just blasting through that game as fast as I could to get to the cutscenes so I could record them.
[22:51.62]That was my only intention, was to get the cutscenes.
[22:57.66]Hey, that means I can use the Krampus.
[23:08.63]The Legacy Collection is such a good deal, though.
[23:10.69]If you don't have... If you want to play Metal Gear and you don't know where to start, you can get Metal Gear for PC.
[23:18.66]You can get it.
[23:19.08]You have to buy it from Amazon or something, but you can get it.
[23:27.10]The Legacy Collection, though.
[23:30.27]is every single Metal Gear game.
[23:33.65]Like, ever.
[23:35.49]Besides... No, I think it is every single Metal Gear game.
[23:41.96]It was like 40 bucks for PS3.
[23:45.10]It was the two NES games.
[23:47.22]Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, 3.
[23:48.48]Oh shit, this room sucks.
[23:54.01]Metal Gear Solid 4, Peace Walker.
[23:57.18]They're all the HD collections, like, it's... Alright, I'm just getting hit by shit I shouldn't be getting hit by.
[24:06.57]Highly recommend it.
[24:08.15]The Legacy Collection, if you have a PS3 and you want to play through all of them.
[24:21.96]Damn it, this is not looking good.
[24:25.45]I'm getting hit by the easy stuff.
[24:27.13]Remember, that's the most important thing you need to remember.
[24:30.63]I get hit by the... Oh, this is... This is good, too.
[24:35.22]Oh, I can't die here.
[24:36.28]That means I can hide behind rocks and just do this.
[24:43.54]Thank God.
[24:44.02]I actually really wanted badly to play through the NES games.
[24:52.37]Because those are old and...
[24:55.95]They have a lot of the story in them too, don't they?
[25:00.08]But the NES footage that I capped was literally just me walking around punching people.
[25:06.34]That's it.
[25:12.85]Bad trip.
[25:18.17]Shit.
[25:22.38]Oh, damn it.
[25:23.48]Damn it.
[25:23.90]Damn it.
[25:24.32]Damn it.
[25:24.72]Damn it.
[25:25.08]Damn it.
[25:25.64]Well, that was inevitable.
[25:28.98]I don't know.
[25:29.76]I used it.
[25:30.55]I shouldn't have used that.
[25:33.71]Alright.
[25:34.11]Well, we got the warm-up round over.
[25:36.47]Now it's time to play the game.
[25:38.45]Okay.
[25:38.97]Well, never mind.
[25:43.15]Alright.
[25:43.69]So, let's just go ahead and exit the game for a second here and let's just start that over.
[26:02.71]probably for the first time coming back to this game in like a very long time I probably shouldn't be playing on hard but you always have to play on hard that's the rule that's the rule
[26:23.45]Oh my god.
[26:24.61]Yeah, I forgot.
[26:25.77]Yep.
[26:26.59]Bad trip becomes full health.
[26:31.13]Shit.
[26:31.91]I could have salvaged that really easily then.
[26:33.61]I just totally forgot.
[26:37.95]That's why that was the warm-up round.
[26:39.29]Because I have to remember how to play this game.
[26:42.64]And I have to remember all the items.
[26:46.08]Yeah, I'm just building up the negative streak.
[26:48.00]The goal is to get the negative streak to negative 40.
[26:56.43]This is good.
[26:57.68]That's a good one to have.
[27:07.52]No, turkeys.
[27:08.18]Don't let the turkeys touch the fire.
[27:09.35]Because then they turn into Thanksgiving turkeys.
[27:13.33]And as you'll see, they'll start to freak out.
[27:16.17]We're good.
[27:20.23]Alright, let me... Let me move a couple things.
[27:22.36]Let me just get more situated here so I can get a little more... Let me get a little more comfortable.
[27:28.00]There we go.
[27:32.96]Who's my favorite YouTuber?
[27:34.22]Uh, Dunkey.
[27:36.95]videogamedunkey.
[27:40.03]He's fucking hysterical.
[27:43.55]Without a doubt, the probably consistently best YouTuber I've ever watched.
[27:50.18]On a consistent basis.
[28:09.47]Isn't there a... Yeah.
[28:12.29]There it is.
[28:14.95]There were spiders in that room.
[28:29.01]Where is it?
[28:29.33]I don't know.
[28:37.45]It's either to the right or it's...
[28:40.00]What do you guys think?
[28:41.86]Down there in that little divot to the left or over here right on the right?
[28:47.70]I'm going to say down to the left.
[28:56.69]Although I'm probably wrong.
[28:59.27]Can I even get in this?
[29:00.19]I don't even know if this is going to hit.
[29:04.19]Will this even hit?
[29:05.95]If I put it right there?
[29:07.82]I don't know if it will.
[29:19.57]I went the opposite of what I thought.
[29:21.49]Oh, yeah.
[29:23.37]Perfect.
[29:24.99]Golden shit.
[29:26.41]I'll take it all.
[29:35.54]Well, I can use the curse from now.
[29:37.48]No, I have a spirit heart.
[29:40.96]Scratch that.
[29:49.49]I don't watch very many YouTube channels, though.
[29:53.03]I try to... I catch things when I can.
[29:54.31]Because typically I'm trying to, you know, make my own videos.
[30:00.57]And one of the... Here's, like, one of the things about watching other YouTube channels, right?
[30:05.67]If there's a game that comes out, let's say, for instance, like, Metal Gear Solid V, right?
[30:10.25]If I want to make a Metal Gear Solid V video, and I want to, like, say the things that I, you know, do it blind and just play it and, like, have fun and have, like, genuine reactions to things...
[30:20.52]If I, like, watch a YouTuber play Metal Gear Solid V, and I see, like, a quote, like, a joke, I'm gonna be very aware of that, and it's gonna be like, well, no, I'm not gonna be totally... That's gonna be... Oh, no, here comes, like... Here comes the big bat that's wicked funny, that everybody thinks is funny, that I already saw.
[30:42.41]That's why I don't really like to watch a whole lot of YouTube game videos.
[30:51.68]We're gonna go.
[30:52.38]I don't want to lose the spirit heart.
[31:02.61]But besides Donkey, I don't really watch a whole lot of YouTube channels.
[31:06.87]Sometimes I will.
[31:11.34]I'll watch TotalBiscuit if he has a video of something that this room sucks.
[31:18.77]Something trending or something like that.
[31:20.35]I'll take a look at it.
[31:21.33]I'll watch it.
[31:23.37]But I don't really spend a whole lot of time on YouTube watching.
[31:38.92]This is the one, guys.
[31:40.86]This just turned into the one.
[31:42.26]Because I just got quad shot.
[31:43.36]If I die with quad shot...
[31:46.14]Then you can take my video game license away from me.
[31:50.94]My gamer license needs to be revoked.
[31:53.34]If I don't at least get to like mom's foot.
[31:56.24]With quad shot.
[32:02.27]Oh, don't spawn these spiders.
[32:10.47]Hmm.
[32:20.64]I'm not going to go in there just yet.
[32:25.24]Your gaming license is a junior license already.
[32:27.84]I got my learner's permit.
[32:30.06]404. 404.
[32:51.15]I can test for it over there, can't I?
[32:58.44]Apparently not.
[33:04.32]This is a terrible idea.
[33:05.20]No, I'm just gonna go.
[33:07.38]This is the... I will end up hurting myself a million times in this room.
[33:10.70]I can already guarantee that.
[33:12.14]What could I possibly be missing down there?
[33:15.13]You know, we'll do this.
[33:15.73]I'm gonna go this way.
[33:19.95]Nothing in this room.
[33:22.99]I knew it.
[33:23.55]I knew it.
[33:23.91]You see?
[33:24.89]No.
[33:25.45]No.
[33:25.83]Let's kill the boss.
[33:26.41]Let's go.
[33:28.50]I'm not going to lose quad shot because the treadmill of death room is right there.
[33:37.01]It's the haunt.
[33:37.71]So this is not going to be that bad.
[33:53.80]Go get him.
[33:54.70]Go get him.
[34:06.36]Oh, yeah.
[34:07.52]Speed and damage up.
[34:08.98]And there's a double room.
[34:11.98]Oh.
[34:13.70]Can I take it all and die?
[34:17.66]Which one of these two?
[34:20.08]It's got to be the little buddy in the middle, right?
[34:22.26]He's just unbelievable.
[34:27.95]I don't know.
[34:32.37]It's gotta be the baby, right?
[34:36.59]These are all very, very good.
[34:40.48]I could do both.
[34:42.14]And have to be extremely careful.
[34:43.94]I'm doing it.
[34:50.92]Fuck it.
[34:55.67]That was a very bad idea.
[34:58.03]Remember what I told you about my gamer license?
[35:00.17]How you need to revoke it?
[35:02.11]Revoke it right now.
[35:03.78]Revoke it because of what I just did.
[35:13.52]Hold on a second.
[35:16.80]Hold on.
[35:17.66]Hold on.
[35:18.26]Star is like trying to get in touch with me.
[35:20.45]Trying to get in contact with me.
[35:26.24]Hold on, I'm getting like bombarded by messages right now.
[35:46.91]Hold on a second.
[35:48.63]Hey, you're on stream.
[35:49.59]You're on stream!
[35:50.98]You're playing The Vining of Isaac, so I'm really compelled to backseat you.
[35:55.04]Don't backseat me.
[35:55.71]The thing you didn't pick up would have given you, like, six black hearts.
[35:58.89]You fucking moron.
[36:00.47]No, but I wanted to do... Quit what you're doing.
[36:02.49]I wanted to do the one that's not the easiest thing.
[36:06.51]I need to turn you down.
[36:09.99]Get turned down.
[36:11.57]I was pretty loud.
[36:14.52]But people really understood my point.
[36:16.42]That's what the whole stream was feeling.
[36:18.63]Hey, when was the last time you played Binding of Isaac?
[36:23.45]Last time I played Binding of Isaac was like a launch.
[36:26.09]I'm relearning the items and stuff.
[36:28.59]That's why I'm here to backseat you.
[36:32.14]Get out of the car.
[36:34.30]I'm pulling over.
[36:35.60]I want to ride shotgun.
[36:38.92]Take me to the micro center.
[36:41.28]Okay.
[36:43.70]I'm definitely going to lose, by the way.
[36:47.46]Definitely going to lose.
[36:52.07]So, hey, how does it feel that usually I'm on your stream, but now you're on my stream?
[36:58.06]Welcome to my world.
[37:00.72]I'm still a little loud, I think.
[37:02.34]Are you?
[37:03.52]Yeah.
[37:07.64]For some reason, I'm just outrageously loud.
[37:10.04]Why are you that loud?
[37:11.54]I don't know.
[37:15.00]Talk now?
[37:16.67]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[37:20.85]No, that was a good talking.
[37:22.31]That was my own.
[37:24.61]Oh, what was it?
[37:27.35]Are you ashamed?
[37:29.73]What was it?
[37:30.39]I don't know.
[37:32.86]Oh, are you... Do you feel blame?
[37:37.22]Are you mad?
[37:38.26]Yeah, that's a very odd video.
[37:47.17]Glad I used the key to get the Magicka.
[37:48.43]Oh, but I mean, I'm in your stream, but I can't stay for long.
[37:51.82]That's okay.
[37:52.92]See, I... That's fine.
[37:55.24]You can stay as little or as long as you want.
[37:58.84]And I'm not going to berate you for it.
[38:07.07]Oh, look like it's that time.
[38:08.27]Look like I have to go now.
[38:09.73]Are you really going, like, right now?
[38:11.31]Shit.
[38:12.33]What is it?
[38:13.09]What is it?
[38:13.39]I don't know.
[38:13.69]It's a question mark.
[38:14.27]It could be the Riddler.
[38:15.51]I don't know.
[38:15.87]It could be the Riddler.
[38:18.89]You don't have an uptime command.
[38:21.11]I don't even have like a nightbot right now.
[38:23.74]I know.
[38:24.04]How long have you been streaming?
[38:25.42]I just turned it on like 20 minutes ago.
[38:27.72]I caught it!
[38:28.50]Yes!
[38:29.88]I woke up early this morning.
[38:31.76]I got out of bed and I had to pee really bad and our toilet's broken.
[38:36.03]Your toilet's broken.
[38:39.28]How did that happen?
[38:40.44]It's like the part that you turn that flushes it.
[38:44.60]Like the handle.
[38:45.65]Yeah.
[38:48.85]It's like it's not connected to the toilet anymore.
[38:53.77]You can pull it out and it's attached to the cord that pulls the thing and still does the action.
[38:58.85]That's really, really interesting.
[38:59.99]What does the Bible attract to?
[39:03.20]Bible track the Bible track and field the missing page or Bible tract this one's just faith up But is it worth it to get the missing page doesn't doesn't don't you turn into?
[39:13.94]Isn't it could the curse or something missing page is the Necronomicon effect 5% chance when you get hit right right and right The Bible tract is just straight up faith up faith up.
[39:26.01]Yeah Okay, are you still loud?
[39:31.57]Probably not
[39:33.31]I turned you down a lot.
[39:39.46]I turned you down mucho.
[39:45.22]Slash uptime really works, I didn't know.
[39:49.79]It does?
[39:50.73]If you have BetterTwitch.TV.
[39:52.75]Oh, BetterTwitch.TV.
[39:59.25]Yeah, did he just give me a spider?
[40:04.08]I thought Doc Bomb gave you... He just shed out a spider, didn't he?
[40:09.58]That's interesting.
[40:12.90]Alright, I need to go back and look at some stuff.
[40:22.17]Oh, that right there.
[40:23.13]That's what I want.
[40:24.29]The green lawnmower?
[40:26.33]That's the one right there.
[40:28.89]Oh my god, he was in my dream.
[40:31.55]Why do you have these dreams?
[40:33.16]What was your dream?
[40:33.94]Did you have a dream about me?
[40:35.37]Like I was spying on you or something and you didn't like me?
[40:37.93]What was it?
[40:39.18]What?
[40:39.62]No, I don't.
[40:40.42]I've had some weird ones lately.
[40:41.98]I don't remember what last night's one was, but I was, like, walking home down the street, and on my right on the phone is Chef Gordon Ramsay talking on his cell phone.
[40:50.63]And I was like, that's fucking Gordon Ramsay.
[40:54.39]And I walked by it, and I have that, like, I know that's him, but, like, I don't want to bother him, so I'm not even going to, like, look at him too much, but, like, I just walked by him.
[41:04.03]That's him right there.
[41:05.75]That's all I remember from the drink.
[41:08.93]Gordon Ramsay.
[41:17.73]Well, if there's ever a dream to have, it's the guy on a cell phone dream.
[41:23.68]That's a great one.
[41:28.00]All stats up, then shuffled.
[41:29.76]Shit.
[41:34.93]I'm too far behind the backseat.
[41:37.99]I think it's still... I'm okay still.
[41:39.97]I don't think you are.
[41:41.21]I'm alright.
[41:41.69]I'm fine.
[41:42.03]I'm fine.
[41:47.44]Oh, well, you had Curse of the Blind anyway.
[41:50.52]That's rough, dude.
[41:51.36]You just got... Dude, that's rough, dude.
[41:54.12]Arcade.
[41:57.48]Hey, do you see how many coins I have here?
[42:00.20]Nine.
[42:07.33]Give me the dollar bill.
[42:11.05]Give me the dollar bill so I can donate $100.
[42:13.05]Shit!
[42:16.51]Shit, shit, shit.
[42:18.53]That was close.
[42:20.05]That was real close.
[42:30.45]Actually, I can do this room, can't I?
[42:33.53]You can do anything you want.
[42:34.66]No, I don't want to do that.
[42:35.84]I'll die in that room.
[42:37.66]You don't have to if you don't want to.
[42:40.60]Evil up or faith?
[42:41.56]Do I... No, I want more faith.
[42:45.06]I can't really do any devil rooms anyways if I get evil up.
[42:52.57]You're not even good at the arcade machine.
[42:54.31]No, I'm really bad at rolling dice into a machine.
[43:04.40]Yes, that's what I wanted.
[43:07.82]That is what I wanted.
[43:11.23]Get him.
[43:11.65]That was almost really, really not good because he was a champion.
[43:18.15]See you later.
[43:22.18]Okay.
[43:23.00]Oh, shit.
[43:23.42]Envy.
[43:31.30]Isn't there a Super Envy?
[43:33.54]Or like a Mega Envy or something?
[43:35.04]There's a Super Everybody.
[43:36.66]I don't have an Activator item, so I might as well just take this.
[43:52.33]Isn't it like my job now to come up with... Yeah, so now it's your job to come up with interesting topics.
[44:01.05]um yeah um so what kind of like pizza are we going to talk about from you I don't know last night I I made some some castillas they were good should I get the strawberry ice cream
[44:24.25]Strawberry ice cream.
[44:25.31]Yeah, should I get the strawberry ice cream?
[44:27.11]Strawberry ice cream is disgusting.
[44:28.92]No, the strawberry ice cream that's not on the cone.
[44:32.18]It's just kind of... It fell on the ground.
[44:33.72]Like, I dropped my strawberry ice cream.
[44:36.16]Plop.
[44:37.54]Like, you bought Napoleon ice cream and one third of that is never going to be eaten by anybody.
[44:42.37]What?
[44:42.55]What?
[44:46.14]You don't like strawberry ice cream?
[44:47.67]Why?
[44:47.95]Me and the other 90% of people.
[44:50.69]What?
[44:50.95]No, that's not right.
[44:52.41]That's not true.
[44:53.33]All the people in the chat right now are going to tell you that a large amount of them are going to enjoy strawberry ice cream.
[44:59.32]No, because all the people that like strawberry ice cream are going to speak up, but the other 90% are just like...
[45:05.13]like come on guys strawberry ice cream is fine as long as you don't look I don't like the strawberry ice cream with like the chunks in it if ice cream has the chunky strawberry bits and it ends up there was a place in New Jersey oh I think it was actually rita's rita's italian ice they put like chunks of fruit in their italian ice it was really good
[45:26.66]I don't even, like, like pineapple, and I think there was, like, a pineapple flavor.
[45:30.20]That was the shit.
[45:31.64]You see, I think a lot of people now are gonna flip-flop on you and be like, well, that's gross, because, like, chunks of fruit and ice cream is gross.
[45:40.09]I would agree with you 100% of the time, except for my good girl, Rita.
[45:46.93]Oh, boy.
[45:49.21]Someone in here is gonna know that, and then they're gonna support strawberry ice cream and that.
[45:54.02]And then I'm gonna be torn.
[45:56.65]Someone says Rita's is fantastic.
[45:58.58]This works with quad shot?
[45:59.90]Oh, man.
[46:00.40]I need tears up so bad.
[46:02.36]Please give me tears up.
[46:04.60]This is going to be outrageous if I get tears up.
[46:07.48]You're not beating this game.
[46:11.43]I have so little faith in you.
[46:13.13]Why?
[46:13.41]It's full health.
[46:19.81]You just don't think I'm going to beat this?
[46:24.73]Why?
[46:25.59]This build is fucking awesome.
[46:28.17]Alright, whatever you say.
[46:33.15]I'm accounting for the Jerma factor.
[46:35.23]So, you don't even know what the Jerma factor entails.
[46:38.07]You, like, made that up, and you don't even know what it means.
[46:40.29]You know what it means?
[46:42.31]It means guaranteed victory.
[46:46.41]I never did know what it meant.
[46:49.07]You see what's happening right now?
[46:51.23]I like, come on.
[46:53.17]Let's shoot the roller coaster.
[46:53.97]I don't want to lose to the fucking roller coaster.
[46:57.75]He has the Bible track.
[46:59.39]He does have the Bible track too.
[47:03.06]Look at this.
[47:03.62]All I got to do is this and just avoid them.
[47:06.38]You think I'm going to lose this?
[47:07.70]You think I'm not going to win?
[47:08.70]Okay, what do you mean by lose?
[47:12.22]By lose, I mean something is going to kill you.
[47:18.50]Aren't we all going to die at some point?
[47:21.63]Some sooner than others.
[47:24.91]Yeah.
[47:26.07]Everybody dies, but especially you.
[47:29.39]Jesus.
[47:30.03]And I just got the rock.
[47:31.39]No, it's the lump of coal.
[47:34.08]Oh my god, dude.
[47:38.10]This is gonna be fucking awesome.
[47:42.04]How dare you have no faith in me when I have the lump of coal in orbit.
[47:50.39]I just think I kind of want to roll here.
[47:53.97]Uh, go, um... No, where's the... The secret room could be... There's a lot of places where that could be.
[48:00.01]Yeah, go to the dark room.
[48:01.47]Your build's really looking strong.
[48:07.40]Go to the dark room?
[48:11.20]Yeah.
[48:11.32]Oh, I just want to see.
[48:13.38]Uh, I'm going to buy one of these.
[48:14.80]Because it's on sale.
[48:16.38]And I can't help myself.
[48:17.54]I have to buy everything on sale.
[48:26.31]You know, there's like one or two people that like really, really, really hate me because of how I played Binding of Isaac.
[48:32.34]That have like held a grudge for probably months.
[48:34.66]I see like, it has to be the same guy.
[48:36.88]I don't know, but I see this comment every now and again, every once in a while.
[48:42.00]That like, wow, Star's like so fucking full of himself.
[48:44.58]And whenever he played Binding of Isaac, he would play as Zazel.
[48:48.96]Like, someone was really mad that I played a lot of Azazel.
[48:51.70]And it's lasted months.
[48:54.00]It used to irritate me when you would only play Azazel and you would just quit if there was not a curse room.
[49:04.39]You would quit the game.
[49:06.77]You would exit the game if there wasn't a curse room in the first room.
[49:10.99]So, I can understand that, guys.
[49:13.48]Upset.
[49:13.76]I just wanted to go fast, dude.
[49:18.81]And it wasn't like the first week the game came out.
[49:20.99]Life isn't about ta- Life isn't about- Look.
[49:24.19]The road to life is always under construction.
[49:27.80]I said that wrong.
[49:31.84]How does that saying go?
[49:32.64]You don't have to do- You don't have to go- It's not about going fast.
[49:36.54]It's about like, the road to life is always under construction.
[49:39.46]You go slow in the work zones.
[49:43.10]Otherwise you hit construction with things, I guess.
[49:49.84]Ever since you came in here, I started playing poorly.
[49:51.96]You're like a bad muse.
[49:53.24]Alright.
[49:59.94]Guess it's time to go.
[50:03.32]What's your plan today?
[50:04.80]Oh, shit.
[50:05.24]This is not good.
[50:07.02]Oh, dear.
[50:07.58]Bad room.
[50:08.20]Very bad.
[50:12.89]Made it out alive.
[50:20.44]I just don't understand why you're not playing Rampage Knights.
[50:25.03]I thought I flooded up Isaac.
[50:34.77]Holy crap.
[50:37.71]These guys are so protected by these flying faces.
[50:51.90]Yikes.
[50:55.50]What does the moon do?
[51:11.30]What?
[51:14.18]What does the moon do?
[51:15.80]I'm with Almop.
[51:17.02]What does the moon do?
[51:20.56]The moon?
[51:21.04]Yeah.
[51:22.70]Takes you to the secret room.
[51:28.35]I spaced out, like, forgot you're playing Isaac, and I'm just like, it fucking, like, changes the tides.
[51:33.55]It orbits the Earth.
[51:35.61]Like, what do you want?
[51:36.89]Did you just, like, forget where you were?
[51:38.29]Yeah, I don't know.
[51:39.71]What does the moon do?
[51:43.31]You think I was just asking you what the moon does?
[51:46.22]Yeah, like, I don't... How is the moon going to help you right now?
[51:48.68]I don't understand.
[51:51.20]What does the moon do?
[51:54.06]Go get it.
[51:54.72]Go get that heart.
[51:55.90]Not much.
[51:56.92]Go get that heart.
[51:58.33]You bastard.
[52:01.65]Now go get it.
[52:05.63]Go get it.
[52:05.95]Yeah, good job.
[52:10.93]Red patch.
[52:14.98]I kind of like the faith, though.
[52:16.54]Red Patch is, um... It's Samson, right?
[52:21.48]When you take damage, it makes you do more damage, right?
[52:25.90]Something pointless like that.
[52:31.11]Okay, well... Well... Let's go to the secret room.
[52:40.11]No.
[52:41.37]Don't.
[52:41.63]Box.
[52:42.17]What's in the box?
[52:44.29]Bombs.
[52:46.64]Excellent.
[52:47.24]There's not much else for me to do.
[52:56.20]I probably shouldn't be unnecessarily injuring myself if I run into something I don't like.
[53:09.53]Child's heart.
[53:10.47]What does the child's heart do?
[53:13.63]It brightens your day.
[53:15.79]Oh, don't pick up
[53:17.58]Isn't that that?
[53:19.06]No.
[53:20.53]That's the tick, the one you can't take off, right?
[53:22.45]Oh, no, that's the one where the child's... Oh, shit.
[53:24.79]Oh, no, I thought you were... That was Isaac's heart.
[53:26.43]I gotta stand right over here and have him hit himself.
[53:29.15]I was thinking about Isaac's.
[53:30.93]Shit, I don't have any keys.
[53:39.30]I dare you to get a key.
[53:40.62]Fuck.
[53:43.32]Damn it!
[53:45.30]I need a key.
[53:45.96]I need to open this.
[53:46.56]I need a key.
[53:47.38]Give me a key.
[53:48.80]You didn't give me a key, did you?
[53:52.24]It's okay.
[53:54.70]I lost one of the house keys too, man.
[53:56.98]You've already lost a house key?
[53:58.42]I think they're in one of the pockets somewhere.
[54:02.58]You've only been there for like a day or two.
[54:05.18]I don't know.
[54:05.62]I'm going to blame Ashley.
[54:08.29]She lost it.
[54:10.73]This dog just keeps shitting in my room.
[54:14.31]It's too bad that that wasn't a key in there.
[54:17.01]I need to find a key.
[54:17.68]I have to get in that item room.
[54:20.40]There's two secret rooms then, right?
[54:22.64]No.
[54:23.88]Well, the super secret, but... No, I do not have the lost, and I probably never will get the lost.
[54:34.77]I wouldn't recommend it.
[54:38.15]It's the one-hit-and-you-die thing, right?
[54:40.37]Yeah.
[54:44.09]Come on, give me a key.
[54:47.19]I need a key.
[54:49.77]I need a key.
[54:51.15]What's that from?
[54:54.38]Come on.
[54:55.38]Thank you.
[54:59.20]Is that like the barbarian?
[55:00.44]I need a key.
[55:02.28]Oh, you know why the assassin's so good?
[55:04.04]The assassin never needs keys.
[55:05.63]I need a key.
[55:08.51]Follow me.
[55:09.57]Follow me.
[55:10.21]Follow me.
[55:11.15]Time to die.
[55:12.45]I need a key.
[55:16.85]I don't know why, like when you say that, it sounds like the bitrate of your mic has changed.
[55:21.85]Really?
[55:23.92]This sounds... different.
[55:28.66]You really know how to like become a 90s game.
[55:31.30]Oh, the Hierophant.
[55:33.70]Oh no, Lust.
[55:43.21]Thank you, Lust, but unfortunately, I don't need pills.
[55:47.58]I need a key.
[55:50.51]Fuck.
[55:56.33]That impression is like so bad it's perfect.
[56:00.63]What are you talking about?
[56:01.53]That's exactly how he says it.
[56:03.57]It is.
[56:04.43]I need a key.
[56:07.09]Please.
[56:07.47]It's like you're not even saying it.
[56:09.25]It's like you're pressing a soundboard.
[56:12.58]You had like a D2 soundboard ready for me to guess it.
[56:15.92]Shit, how do I get a key?
[56:22.31]What's the secret to get a key?
[56:26.07]I've already been in the secret room.
[56:27.39]It's poor planning.
[56:30.41]I'm just going to open up everything.
[56:36.42]Wheel of Fortune, give me a key.
[56:39.04]Give me a key.
[56:41.68]Give me a key.
[56:43.68]Give me a key!
[56:45.60]Give me a key!
[56:47.58]Give me a key!
[56:49.41]Give me a key!
[56:51.17]Give me a key!
[56:55.27]Shit, this sucks.
[56:58.07]I'm not gonna get a key.
[57:01.65]I know, that's how the barbarians did it.
[57:04.29]I need a key!
[57:06.52]You fucker!
[57:07.62]Key!
[57:17.98]Hey, hey, didn't we have a bet recently?
[57:20.30]You said you were going to play Diablo II again.
[57:22.06]Like you just felt like playing Diablo II again.
[57:23.84]And I said there is an absolutely like a 3% chance you're getting to hell.
[57:28.97]How far did you get?
[57:31.15]You'd like to know.
[57:33.01]I would because I don't think you beat normal.
[57:35.95]I beat normal.
[57:38.69]And then I put it like a 30% chance you beat nightmare.
[57:41.55]And you were so confident.
[57:44.90]Yeah, well, you saw how that turned out for you.
[57:47.51]You won that one.
[57:49.31]Rocks.
[57:49.71]Looking for, like, tinted rocks.
[57:53.57]There's gotta be, like, a key hidden in one of these rocks.
[57:56.07]Come on.
[57:59.00]Any other ones?
[58:01.08]Did I miss any other rocks?
[58:02.38]Sometimes.
[58:02.68]Can you blow up the skulls and sometimes they have stuff in them?
[58:04.38]Uh, usually.
[58:06.12]Oh my god.
[58:06.68]It's a card against humanity.
[58:10.65]Doesn't that fill an entire room with poo?
[58:13.50]I believe so.
[58:15.08]And what's the chance that I get a key from shit?
[58:18.49]Zero.
[58:18.93]Fuck.
[58:20.69]Well, we're gonna keep it.
[58:22.07]Isn't it?
[58:25.63]Am I seriously gonna go around and blow up as many of these things as I can and try to get... Okay, good.
[58:29.39]Maybe this guy will drop a key.
[58:33.68]I think you just move on.
[58:34.68]Yeah.
[58:36.42]Quadrum?
[58:38.30]Quadrum?
[58:42.74]I'm going to go to the big room and fill it up.
[58:47.98]You're going to get like 99 coins.
[58:55.28]Look at how easily I can clear this.
[58:59.30]You want to talk about clearing a room?
[59:00.70]I feel like I'm popping bubble wrap.
[59:09.29]You're not.
[59:11.20]I said it feels like I am.
[59:12.12]Did I say I am?
[59:12.86]You're not.
[59:13.54]Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[59:22.08]This actually just might have sealed the deal that I'm going to be able to get through this.
[59:26.65]I wish I had done this before.
[59:28.03]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[59:32.61]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[59:35.09]Oh, this just got way better.
[59:38.45]Oh, the stone poop?
[59:41.87]Yes.
[59:42.33]You're going to get like 99 coins.
[59:45.31]Give me the money.
[59:50.09]Nice.
[59:53.78]Nice.
[59:55.26]I can't even get any more hearts.
[59:56.58]I'm totally full.
[59:59.20]I'm super full.
[60:01.62]I can't eat another bite.
[60:03.02]I can't.
[60:05.61]So I'm going to get the faith up again, just because I don't really have a need for really anything anymore.
[60:10.65]Wasn't there an arcade?
[60:13.06]Was that in the other level?
[60:15.98]Please go play all the coins in the arcade.
[60:19.90]Where is the arcade?
[60:21.86]I think I already went by it.
[60:24.00]I think I did it already.
[60:24.74]I believe the arcade has been passed.
[60:32.00]Alright, let's go.
[60:32.70]Whatever, we're just going to go...
[60:35.51]Where?
[60:37.17]Micro center?
[60:38.09]No.
[60:39.19]It doesn't matter how many times this guy hits me.
[60:41.07]I don't care.
[60:46.24]Because I can just walk right out the door and get one of those spirit hearts.
[60:52.48]Like that.
[60:58.06]Just like Cap.
[60:58.98]I can possibly... You know, I don't want to waste all these bombs.
[61:02.42]We'll try one more time on this group of skulls.
[61:05.35]Lower left.
[61:08.05]Come on.
[61:08.47]It's the moon.
[61:11.07]No.
[61:12.23]The moon is... Shit.
[61:16.97]Last one.
[61:17.93]This is the last skull.
[61:19.35]I'm gonna go with two bombs.
[61:21.49]Fuck my face.
[61:23.26]Shit.
[61:24.96]Shit.
[61:28.44]What's the one that takes you to the item room?
[61:29.75]Isn't there a card?
[61:33.41]There's a card that actually does it, right?
[61:34.75]The stars.
[61:35.65]Yeah.
[61:37.53]Whatever.
[61:38.21]Let's just go.
[61:38.77]Just wasting time now.
[61:48.10]Yeah, a little bit.
[61:48.76]Well, I don't even have to go even in that area.
[61:51.66]I had to get to work, but you know.
[61:55.33]I have to watch Jerma instead.
[61:57.53]Good job.
[61:57.95]Like, lost my job.
[62:00.74]Lost a job.
[62:09.90]Buying a key.
[62:11.04]I'll buy one if I can find one.
[62:20.49]Maybe you can get the... Swipe the... Yeah, if I get the card, that turns keys into bombs.
[62:26.07]Or vice versa.
[62:27.33]That would be helpful.
[62:32.99]What the hell?
[62:37.29]I still can't believe you don't have any faith in him.
[62:38.87]Key!
[62:39.61]Yes!
[62:40.21]Alright, I gotta go back up.
[62:40.97]No, now you're gonna win.
[62:42.27]Now I'm gonna climb back up.
[62:46.25]Shit, I hate these things.
[62:47.81]We'll do that later.
[62:54.10]More keys.
[62:54.90]See, I started talking about it, and all of a sudden, he gave me one.
[62:57.63]Thanks, Ed.
[63:04.83]Alright.
[63:06.47]Why is there never anything good in here?
[63:14.30]The plug doesn't really do anything interesting, does it?
[63:16.28]The what?
[63:18.50]The plug.
[63:19.66]The item, it's like a... It's a plug.
[63:21.72]It's a grey, like, white plug.
[63:24.45]Ah, that thing doesn't do anything at all.
[63:30.41]No, let's just do this.
[63:32.11]Secret room.
[63:34.05]Coins, wonderful coins.
[63:35.19]Wait, are you playing as Isaac right now?
[63:43.05]Yes.
[63:44.27]Where the fuck are your dice?
[63:45.07]Um... I don't think I have the dice.
[63:51.79]Really?
[63:52.57]I have, like, you're talking about the D100 or whatever it is?
[63:56.35]The D6 that you start the game with.
[63:58.77]No, I don't have that.
[64:01.79]You haven't beaten the game yet.
[64:04.96]I've beaten Mega Satan, like, three times.
[64:09.24]Not with Isaac.
[64:10.48]I don't, like, I never play the game with Isaac.
[64:13.64]I, like, really?
[64:14.72]Isaac is my probably least played character in this entire game.
[64:18.14]Well, he's the front man.
[64:19.12]Isaac, I'm the front man.
[64:21.98]I've done most of my playtime with, like, Kayn, uh, what's the guy, Lucas?
[64:28.86]Not Lucas, um... LucasArts?
[64:32.81]Oh, I just farted you.
[64:36.91]I think you're right, it's Lucas.
[64:41.39]Blue Baby's too hard to play.
[64:42.43]It's just too hard for me.
[64:44.61]I come with gifts and squares!
[64:48.21]I got some squares, dude.
[64:53.82]Give me some more keys.
[64:55.42]And more garbage.
[64:57.34]Jerma streaming.
[64:58.64]Yes?
[64:59.90]Oh, sorry.
[65:00.52]I don't have to be sorry.
[65:03.62]No, she's like on the ground doing the prayer like, I'm sorry.
[65:10.77]Okay, is this like really odd that I haven't gotten really anything from this?
[65:13.83]I've spent like $45.
[65:14.29]And did still nothing.
[65:18.85]These things shit out items like candy.
[65:21.46]Why is it doing this?
[65:23.36]Terribly?
[65:23.84]Yeah, I've gotten like three things.
[65:27.18]And like, you know what?
[65:28.98]Screw that.
[65:29.40]I don't even know what that is.
[65:33.20]Broken magnet?
[65:41.08]I can get rid of these coins.
[65:43.14]I don't really care.
[65:43.72]I'm about to go fight mom anyways in a second.
[65:48.04]No, mom!
[65:49.32]Crystal ball.
[65:50.44]I see my future.
[65:53.84]That's a long cooldown.
[65:54.92]What does it do?
[65:56.82]It reveals the map.
[65:59.35]That's super.
[66:00.49]It gives you a random card, I think.
[66:02.15]Does it really?
[66:02.59]Let's look at it.
[66:06.74]Oh, that's really, really incredibly, incredibly helpful, especially in the next couple of rounds.
[66:11.40]What does the dumb magnet do?
[66:16.58]I'm pretty sure it like half pulls coins at you and you don't want it.
[66:19.79]Yeah, I don't want it.
[66:25.23]Well, let's just go to the item room and let's get the hell out of here.
[66:30.22]No, stick around.
[66:31.56]Do some more gambling.
[66:32.72]Did I just get hurt?
[66:36.29]What hurt me?
[66:36.97]twitch.tv, the number one place to go for gambling.
[66:47.52]Alright, something good.
[66:49.22]Oh, I got a lot of buddies flying around now.
[66:55.08]Let's just go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[66:58.60]Wow.
[66:59.08]Oh!
[67:03.09]I did not expect that.
[67:04.73]I will say.
[67:06.05]I did not expect that.
[67:10.60]Here we go.
[67:10.94]Let's do it.
[67:12.42]See ya.
[67:24.45]And I got the Polaroid.
[67:25.61]So, you know.
[67:28.69]Moving on.
[67:29.47]Moving on forward.
[67:33.79]How depressing.
[67:35.97]And I have this thing too.
[67:36.81]Curse of Darkness?
[67:37.39]That's not cool.
[67:43.70]We'll still be able to reveal the entire map in a minute.
[67:52.28]Hey!
[67:52.82]Okay, where are we going?
[67:53.96]We're going down.
[67:54.66]Actually, no.
[67:56.08]I wanna go to Disney World.
[68:00.34]Yeah, I don't care about the secret room.
[68:01.80]No.
[68:02.90]We're going for completion right now.
[68:04.62]Because my build is pretty great.
[68:07.60]So, we're just going for completion.
[68:10.29]There's one more tongue asshole over there.
[68:13.35]There he is.
[68:15.33]Didn't even need to go in this room.
[68:17.53]But, whatever.
[68:21.63]You ever been to Disney World?
[68:23.55]One time.
[68:24.67]Was it magical?
[68:26.04]It was great.
[68:26.38]Were you four years old?
[68:27.34]I think I was eight.
[68:30.53]I had a great time.
[68:35.30]I thoroughly enjoyed it.
[68:38.94]Would you recommend me to go?
[68:40.08]I don't know.
[68:46.22]I really fucking want to make out with Elsa.
[68:54.03]Will I get my chance?
[69:03.82]Let's go.
[69:04.38]Let's go.
[69:06.56]We're going for Satan.
[69:11.41]This one should be fairly simple because I have Orbit.
[69:13.77]Yeah, that was... That was pretty easy.
[69:21.26]Hey, look at that.
[69:23.04]HP up and a Devil Room.
[69:25.52]Why am I getting Devil Room?
[69:27.32]Oh, dude, I can do...
[69:31.27]Anything that we want to do.
[69:33.33]Could I just get the shovel and just dig down and skip the next area?
[69:37.90]That will take you down to the darkies.
[69:42.14]What's the next area?
[69:45.55]I'm not paying any attention.
[69:47.55]Shale, whatever it is.
[69:50.09]I don't know.
[69:50.39]I kind of think that's cheating.
[69:51.98]Have you beaten the Darkroom?
[69:53.60]That's a new question.
[69:55.38]What Darkroom?
[69:57.08]The Darkroom.
[69:58.54]Is that when you... The two keys?
[70:02.52]I don't even know what that means.
[70:06.88]I've beaten everything.
[70:08.10]I've killed Mega Satan.
[70:09.56]Doesn't that mean I've done everything?
[70:11.22]No.
[70:12.06]I've beaten Isaac.
[70:13.42]Have you done the Darkroom?
[70:16.84]I don't think so.
[70:18.22]Well, then, yeah, go down to the... The hell place and kill Satan and then do the dark room.
[70:28.81]Good... God!
[70:30.39]No, look, I'm just going.
[70:31.27]We're doing it the old-fashioned way.
[70:32.75]I'm not doing any, like, skips and cheats and... We're doing it the old-fashioned way.
[70:38.29]Well, did you pick up... The, uh... At the foot... The... The photograph.
[70:45.84]I have the puller right here.
[70:46.50]What's it called?
[70:47.44]You have...
[70:49.94]Did the negative even spawn for you?
[70:51.50]No, I had the Polaroid, not the negative.
[70:54.42]But did the negative spawn?
[70:56.54]No.
[70:58.66]Why can't I... Oh.
[71:02.67]Mysterious candy.
[71:03.57]No, I don't want that.
[71:05.69]You're, like, not my friend anymore.
[71:14.50]Mm-hmm.
[71:15.12]There's another arcade.
[71:16.84]Might as well spend my remaining coins.
[71:19.53]Alright, we haven't had any luck with the... I'm gonna try this guy.
[71:33.21]Come on.
[71:33.69]Give me that.
[71:35.90]Shit.
[71:41.34]What is with this bad luck?
[71:46.08]Finally.
[71:56.99]Destroy everything.
[72:01.67]Destroy it all.
[72:07.34]Let's just go.
[72:07.84]Let's just go.
[72:10.56]Whoa!
[72:11.80]That just freaked me out.
[72:13.90]I thought for a second I had a different shot.
[72:21.10]Damn it.
[72:21.81]Went the wrong way.
[72:23.71]Damn it!
[72:28.73]Getting sloppy at the end there.
[72:35.41]No, it's up here.
[72:42.08]Pretty sloppy, dude.
[72:47.80]The tower just spawns a million bombs, right?
[72:49.70]You gotta be careful using it.
[72:52.40]Yep.
[72:54.68]Yep.
[72:56.84]Yep.
[72:59.33]I don't think it's worth me going up here to do another room.
[73:03.31]No, it's not worth it.
[73:04.23]No, you gotta do the rift.
[73:06.09]Chest within a chest.
[73:09.75]Yeah, let's just... Gotta do the rift.
[73:20.17]I need a key.
[73:24.26]I don't anymore.
[73:26.24]I didn't even see that.
[73:27.24]That blended in so much with the ground.
[73:33.06]It shouldn't have gone that way.
[73:46.03]Alright.
[73:47.41]Get up!
[74:01.39]Alright.
[74:03.60]I have the Polaroid, so that means I should go to heaven, right?
[74:07.84]Yeah.
[74:09.20]Let's go!
[74:12.68]Go to heaven, Jerma.
[74:13.60]It's a cathedral.
[74:18.66]Look at that.
[74:19.40]We get to skip it all.
[74:23.82]The Hermit.
[74:28.06]Hermit is...
[74:33.31]It takes you to your shop.
[74:39.46]There's no shop, so it just kind of randomly zoinks you.
[74:43.72]It zoinks you?
[74:45.02]Yeah, it zoinks you, man.
[74:45.94]I don't want to get zoinked.
[74:47.98]Wheel of Fortune.
[74:48.66]I don't want to get zoinked.
[75:03.70]I'm really looking forward to the Greed mode in the DLC coming up.
[75:09.08]That seems like it's going to be a ton of fun.
[75:12.23]I'm really interested in transforming into Lord Gabin, the Gabin item set.
[75:20.09]Is that real?
[75:22.39]I would hope not.
[75:24.47]I thought you were being serious.
[75:30.24]Greed doesn't really do anything for me at the moment.
[75:45.15]The plague.
[75:52.42]Ooh.
[75:55.36]I have the vision.
[75:56.38]Ansoos.
[75:57.10]Doesn't that just show you everything?
[75:59.08]There's secrets or something.
[76:01.30]What does?
[76:02.30]Ansoos.
[76:03.80]The rocks.
[76:04.58]The purple crystals.
[76:07.18]Vision.
[76:10.52]That's...
[76:14.09]Not like it really matters at all at this point.
[76:16.61]That's the one that turns you into Lord Gabig.
[76:21.77]God.
[76:25.39]Alright.
[76:37.04]Umbilical cords down there.
[76:38.78]Coin.
[76:39.90]Pills.
[76:40.18]We're just going to do it.
[76:47.21]Is this the thing that makes it so you are protected?
[76:49.39]Paralysis.
[76:56.91]Is this the thing that... Is this the thing that... There's so many items and I just don't remember what any of them do.
[77:05.04]So, whatever.
[77:07.38]Actually, I forgot what that one does, too.
[77:09.86]All the trinkets.
[77:10.58]Literally all the trinkets.
[77:11.36]I don't know what any of them do, really.
[77:12.72]Except for a handful of them.
[77:13.92]I always forget.
[77:16.10]You have to know what cancer does, and the curved horn, and then who cares.
[77:23.66]Hopefully there's some good trinkets in the expansion.
[77:43.21]Whoa!
[77:44.57]Why would you just type horny star?
[77:48.64]Is horny, like, what?
[77:52.06]Oh my god, why are these things still alive?
[77:53.86]It just gave me such a pain in the ass.
[77:56.78]Well, here we go.
[77:58.65]Here we go, win or lose.
[78:00.67]Win or lose, win or lose, whatever.
[78:02.13]It's gonna be actually hard for me to see what I'm doing here because of all the stuff that's in my way.
[78:12.34]Like me.
[78:18.54]I just mentioned porn, did I?
[78:24.49]Did I?
[78:27.57]No?
[78:29.05]Shit, that doesn't work.
[78:31.67]Unless it was my sexual attraction for Lord Gavin.
[78:35.73]Shit.
[78:55.08]Yeah!
[78:55.98]Yeah!
[79:00.88]Okay, so this is the chest.
[79:02.14]Did you just really lose all your soul hearts?
[79:06.16]It was pretty much from the other room.
[79:10.37]I don't have the key, though.
[79:11.67]And you got hit.
[79:13.17]You're fucking trashed here.
[79:15.01]I'm not watching this anymore.
[79:17.23]Open everything.
[79:17.63]I'm not watching this anymore!
[79:18.95]I hit my phone.
[79:26.21]I just picked up so many things.
[79:28.41]Jump.
[79:28.75]Alright, we're going to do this and then we're going to jump.
[79:39.62]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[79:41.72]We'll find out, right?
[79:46.30]This is where we lose.
[79:47.16]It's okay.
[79:49.95]I beat the cathedral.
[79:50.75]Thank you.
[80:02.45]Yeah, you're dead.
[80:03.19]They're blocking so many of my shots.
[80:05.63]My pessimism was right.
[80:07.80]I beat the game.
[80:08.36]No, you didn't.
[80:10.44]I completed it.
[80:11.40]I beat... I'm dead.
[80:14.00]See, I started, like, talking to you, and I just lost.
[80:16.56]Oh, that's why you lost.
[80:18.70]You didn't lose because you lost, like, seven soul hearts in Cathedral.
[80:22.19]Hey, maybe if you, like, weren't fucking in here annoying me, I would have, like, not fucked up.
[80:27.13]I came in here to give you $20,000, and this is, like, you're not getting it now.
[80:34.83]Well, that was alright.
[80:36.93]I got to the chest.
[80:38.27]That's good enough.
[80:39.85]On hard.
[80:40.29]That was on hard, by the way.
[80:42.67]Oh, wow.
[80:43.69]That wasn't on normal.
[80:45.67]That's why you couldn't find a key.
[80:46.85]Because you played on let's not have fun mode.
[80:50.77]Actually, I want to play as a different character.
[80:54.67]What, did you not know that was hard mode?
[80:58.44]Do I get a little bit more respect from you now because that was hard?
[81:02.27]No.
[81:02.55]Of course not.
[81:03.91]No you don't.
[81:07.35]Hard mode just like makes you not get keys.
[81:09.99]That's like it.
[81:10.49]Oh, it spawns more champions.
[81:13.18]Oh, this is so hard.
[81:14.40]Alright guys, let's do the star stat.
[81:15.98]Let's do the star stats.
[81:19.18]Okay, ready?
[81:19.60]Here we go.
[81:25.00]No, no.
[81:25.82]The curse rub in the first rub.
[81:27.92]Get it.
[81:30.09]Okay.
[81:32.01]Give me.
[81:34.43]No, reset.
[81:36.49]Hold on.
[81:36.83]Okay, let's go again.
[81:43.44]You're just making yourself look bad.
[81:44.86]Like, only fucking shitty players use that laser.
[81:49.12]Fucking, like, looking really bad right now.
[81:51.85]He does so much damage.
[81:52.99]That's ridiculous.
[81:53.39]That's ridiculous.
[82:11.53]HP up, and you feel protected.
[82:13.73]Well, now I kind of have to play.
[82:16.29]As Azazel.
[82:18.15]Now he's fucking shitty.
[82:19.13]He's like, oh, look at the starship.
[82:20.45]I'm gonna play the one.
[82:23.10]I feel insulted right now.
[82:28.62]Didn't hit anybody.
[82:48.41]Yeah!
[82:54.54]All stats upped and shuffled, hooray.
[83:01.14]I hope you lose this run.
[83:08.01]I hope I lose this run.
[83:09.15]I don't think you can, but I hope you do.
[83:24.88]I'm pronouncing it.
[83:26.02]Is it Azazel?
[83:28.04]How do you pronounce it?
[83:29.82]What's the actual pronunciation?
[83:35.06]Two of hearts.
[83:38.90]Whatever.
[83:39.18]I'm just going to use this first.
[83:41.60]That just brought me right back here.
[83:48.46]Left down, up right.
[83:49.44]Left down, up right.
[83:50.30]L1, L2, R1, R2.
[83:53.24]I'm gonna get all of Guppy.
[83:54.36]Another spirit heart.
[84:09.67]Fantastic.
[84:13.83]What?
[84:14.53]Was that a burp?
[84:21.69]No?
[84:23.11]Alright, yeah, it was.
[84:24.13]See what, you get a problem?
[84:28.05]Is there an issue with my burps?
[84:30.17]I didn't even burp, I went like... Damage up.
[84:45.98]Let's just get rid of the boss.
[84:49.10]Uh-oh, it's Pinhead.
[84:58.69]Dude, who doesn't have the GTA weapon cheat memorized?
[85:01.23]I don't.
[85:04.84]I wish I could see these spiders.
[85:13.40]He accepts your offering.
[85:20.51]Item room is still over there.
[85:40.68]So, how's everybody's day?
[85:41.94]Oh, my day is going great!
[85:45.16]I was talking to the chat.
[85:45.98]I want to know how the chat's going.
[85:48.49]You weren't talking to me.
[85:55.97]I think I've done everything with him.
[85:59.31]I'm pretty sure.
[86:01.01]And there's toxic blood.
[86:05.15]There's one thing I haven't done with him.
[86:07.78]What is it?
[86:09.24]You can look in the character selection.
[86:11.50]Yeah, I'm just trying to think.
[86:14.36]You'll never remember.
[86:16.78]You can't remember what shoes you wore yesterday.
[86:21.50]I kind of can because I have one pair of sneakers I'm wearing right now.
[86:24.90]Did you wear them?
[86:26.02]Yes, I did.
[86:29.02]Sure about that?
[86:41.02]You should have some breakfast.
[86:43.68]I haven't gotten out of bed yet.
[86:47.70]Hey.
[86:48.90]It's still pretty early.
[86:49.66]What time is it right now?
[86:51.55]Time to get out of bed.
[86:53.33]Is it Eastern?
[86:53.83]What time is it Eastern?
[86:55.73]It is Easter, yes.
[86:57.83]Hey, is it Easter?
[86:58.85]Is it Easter yet?
[87:00.16]Is it Easter?
[87:01.22]It's pretty early for Easter.
[87:09.66]Double.
[87:11.78]It should give you an achievement when you get a double kill.
[87:16.63]Wow, look at that double.
[87:20.23]That really encouraged some double.
[87:21.88]Alright, so are you gonna contribute, like, anything to this stream?
[87:29.54]Well, every topic I've brought up, you, like, go, uh, yeah.
[87:33.61]And then you, like, play the game.
[87:36.63]You, like, don't want to talk to me about anything.
[87:39.41]You just want to, like, play your, like, little child game.
[87:43.25]Like, where you play as, like, a little boy.
[87:45.01]Oh, look at that, right off the bat.
[87:48.44]Doc bomb.
[87:49.80]See, this is what happens!
[87:51.06]We start talking about something, then you pick up an item, and then we're done.
[87:55.24]Then you're gonna complain to me?
[87:56.63]Fuck you, dude.
[87:57.67]Hey, dude, do you see what I got?
[87:59.51]Woohoo!
[88:02.57]Actually gonna be a pain to find the item room.
[88:04.07]So Star, how was your day today?
[88:08.83]Woohoo!
[88:09.20]Oh, woohoo!
[88:12.76]I'm not even kidding right now.
[88:16.34]My finger...
[88:18.58]was pushing down on right bumper.
[88:24.23]It was less than centimeters away from this run being over.
[88:30.92]Like, I could feel the pressure.
[88:32.14]I almost just did that.
[88:32.64]Very close.
[88:32.96]Fuck.
[88:45.72]Dude.
[88:46.74]No balls?
[88:47.93]With this guy, no balls?
[88:50.35]You don't think I'll do it?
[88:51.95]Anyone see this guy over here with no balls?
[88:54.81]You don't think I'm gonna do it?
[88:55.47]I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[88:58.01]What would you do if I did that right now?
[89:00.99]What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[89:02.33]I don't know.
[89:03.97]What would you... What would happen if this was gonna happen right now?
[89:11.31]Oh.
[89:15.50]Still need the item room.
[89:23.50]Where's it going?
[89:26.94]Where's it going?
[89:27.34]Where's it going?
[89:33.20]And... Invincibility at a cost.
[89:40.76]Now, this is where you can get the keys, right?
[89:44.03]If you do the bomb on the statue.
[89:49.23]Let's try it.
[89:50.97]I'll go for it.
[89:55.49]I actually forget their patterns.
[89:56.77]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[90:07.35]Oh, Bob's brain is not something I actually wanted to pick up right there.
[90:12.91]I really don't like Bob's brain.
[90:17.13]Yeah, he wants Bob to stay stupid.
[90:19.87]Stay blind.
[90:20.77]No, I want Bob to stay smart.
[90:22.59]Keep his brain in his head.
[90:28.05]I've watched you pick it up, too, like, after the fact now.
[90:31.85]It looks like you really wanted it.
[90:33.63]You took a second, looked at it, and then were like, yeah.
[90:36.33]Yeah, but I don't know.
[90:37.31]I kind of thought it was, like,
[90:40.09]Something else for a second.
[90:43.11]The thing with Bob's brain is you have to use it before you do anything else.
[90:45.93]You just have to plan what you're going to do with it first.
[90:56.10]Item, item, item.
[90:57.10]Where's the item room?
[91:06.94]Okay.
[91:10.96]Bob's Burgers.
[91:13.38]I don't watch that show.
[91:14.50]Is it good?
[91:16.28]I've heard nothing good about it.
[91:18.30]You've heard nothing good about it?
[91:20.00]No, nothing.
[91:21.08]I don't know.
[91:21.54]I don't want to go in that curse room.
[91:35.15]What?
[91:37.35]Gosh darn.
[91:40.77]Item room.
[91:43.59]Super sloth.
[91:47.31]Bob's brain, get out of here.
[91:49.14]Please.
[91:50.22]Bob's brain, please.
[91:53.90]Come on, Bobby.
[91:55.98]Consume my enemy.
[91:58.48]Come on, Bobby.
[92:02.89]Doesn't really help me, but I'll take it.
[92:15.30]Alright.
[92:16.42]Where have I not gone?
[92:19.03]Where have I not been?
[92:21.13]School?
[92:24.39]No, I did get the item.
[92:25.87]Okay.
[92:26.97]Confusing myself there for a moment.
[92:36.13]There it is.
[92:36.59]Okay, that's what I was looking for.
[92:43.34]What's the maximum of my coins that gives you stuff from the donation box?
[92:50.24]Like, 999.
[92:52.29]Does it actually have to get you an item from that?
[92:55.11]Yeah, with stopwatch.
[92:57.01]Jeez.
[92:59.11]Oh, jeez.
[93:04.05]It's already in here.
[93:08.04]Okay, let's go.
[93:16.26]You pressed any right trigger?
[93:19.78]Can I press my right trigger?
[93:25.14]No.
[93:27.26]Hey, look, I got Bob's head.
[93:33.61]Can I put Bob's brain back in his head?
[93:37.99]Good joke.
[93:38.29]Didn't work.
[93:42.15]What did you say?
[93:42.69]Good joke?
[93:46.84]Actually, I might even want Bob's brain and Bob's head.
[93:56.28]I feel like they could do a lot of damage together, just at the same time, throw it at somebody.
[94:06.73]Bob transformation.
[94:10.36]Dude, there might actually end up being, like, a Bob strange for me.
[94:13.18]That'd be pretty funny.
[94:14.84]Speaking of Bob, it just hurt me.
[94:16.56]So that's good.
[94:19.76]Ooh.
[94:22.06]Ooh.
[94:24.10]I... Mmm.
[94:28.40]Well... You are the most reliable, I would say.
[94:33.30]I am a very reliable friend.
[94:36.32]Talking about this guy.
[94:38.00]Come on.
[94:54.12]Not so reliable after all, is he?
[95:06.57]Is he gonna give me a key?
[95:07.43]Come on!
[95:07.87]That's like 11 coins, man.
[95:09.89]Yeah.
[95:11.98]Is it gonna kill him?
[95:12.58]No, it's gonna kill him!
[95:13.62]Thank god.
[95:23.65]Dude, seriously, give me an item.
[95:29.59]You son of a bitch.
[95:32.17]Alright, this is invincibility.
[95:33.95]Does that mean I can just keep hitting this over and over again?
[95:39.27]I believe that's what it means.
[95:40.19]Let's see.
[95:40.97]Let's confirm with chat.
[95:43.39]Confirm with chat.
[95:48.12]Jerma looks like my mom's husband.
[95:54.59]Don't complain.
[95:55.11]He literally gave you the world.
[95:56.99]He did.
[95:58.41]He did give me the world.
[95:59.23]You're right.
[96:00.11]That was very, very nice of him.
[96:06.10]Now, let's do it.
[96:09.94]What?
[96:15.38]Is there some kind of indicator?
[96:17.02]Do I have to hold the button down?
[96:18.33]I don't think I've ever had this item before.
[96:20.31]I figured how it works.
[96:21.87]It's a weird item.
[96:23.03]It looked like I just took damage.
[96:28.50]Also, for future reference, Yanub.
[96:32.67]If you stand next to the heart guy, you can give him two hearts while you're invincible.
[96:37.15]Just talk over me.
[96:37.97]I'm trying to help.
[96:42.71]It's very precise.
[96:43.93]Oh, jeez.
[96:44.57]Okay, well, forget that.
[96:53.46]I've never used the item before, so I don't want to just kill myself somehow.
[97:00.49]Well, you gave me bombs.
[97:13.92]Okay, but it hurts you.
[97:15.96]I think I understand now.
[97:19.14]I've literally never seen this item once.
[97:20.92]This is the first time.
[97:23.07]I've heard.
[97:23.39]Hmm.
[97:29.41]I wish I could see how many hearts I had right now.
[97:36.00]You're just all fucking blown up.
[97:44.05]Oh boy!
[97:44.85]So did you guys just see that I just took that actual heart?
[97:49.70]You know what that means, right?
[97:57.08]That means I should not have even been using this item if I didn't understand what it did.
[98:04.58]I hope you die.
[98:09.66]Wiggle worm.
[98:10.10]I can't.
[98:10.70]I don't have any.
[98:11.38]Oh, it actually does work.
[98:12.83]That's funny.
[98:18.05]Good thing I used all my keys.
[98:21.59]hoping and just seriously hoping that that guy was going to give me a sick item.
[98:26.48]Didn't really think that one through either.
[98:27.68]I think there's a key.
[98:48.72]It's up there.
[99:06.90]Fork.
[99:09.10]Did I miss something up here?
[99:10.02]I thought there was a key.
[99:12.44]Wrong button.
[99:34.34]An Ankh!
[99:39.06]Well... I guess I can... I don't know.
[99:48.85]Where's the secret?
[99:51.23]Right here.
[99:54.09]Yep.
[99:55.67]Hooray.
[100:11.29]Are you still in here?
[100:12.65]No.
[100:13.55]What are you doing?
[100:15.48]No.
[100:18.10]Bob's brain, please do not kill me.
[100:27.69]No.
[100:30.43]Can you open up that chest that's down there?
[100:31.93]No.
[100:37.95]I'm not going to use it on that chest.
[100:39.01]I might need it much later.
[100:41.93]No.
[100:45.49]I'm going to keep Bob.
[100:47.59]Yes.
[100:52.04]No.
[101:01.94]Turned into Blue Baby.
[101:05.60]No, what's gonna really smash this one into the ground is Bob's brain is gonna kill me.
[101:12.23]That is a guarantee.
[101:13.17]Let me see if I got my keys back.
[101:26.63]You know what would screw me up the most?
[101:30.33]When it shuffled my stats the second or third room.
[101:35.65]My speed is much slower.
[101:37.37]That's really messing me up.
[101:39.61]No.
[101:52.70]I need this guy to pick up some hearts.
[101:58.14]Yes.
[102:00.76]Great.
[102:02.77]No.
[102:03.19]Yes.
[102:08.21]I'm very glad I'm getting the caveman responses from you.
[102:13.74]No.
[102:14.54]There's a heart up there.
[102:21.28]Yes.
[102:34.38]No.
[102:35.58]Oh, it's actually in the secret room.
[102:38.12]Well, let's go back in there.
[102:40.66]Get it!
[102:40.92]Oh, I thought he had enough.
[102:46.44]Oh well, let's go.
[102:48.20]No.
[102:57.04]That'd be pretty funny if you could turn into Bob.
[103:00.12]No.
[103:08.18]Gertie!
[103:21.50]Bob, don't do it.
[103:33.10]Evil up.
[103:34.04]Sure.
[103:42.10]See ya.
[103:42.52]Alright, well, I guess that's a good any time.
[103:47.14]Yeah.
[103:49.32]Krampus is just... The head is just so, so, so good.
[103:56.14]Yeah, Bob was Bob MVP.
[103:57.26]You're right.
[103:57.84]Bob was the MVP that time.
[104:19.52]Curse of the unknown again, come on.
[104:21.26]Still don't have any idea how much health I have.
[104:24.50]Did he just spawn?
[104:25.30]I'm kind of confused, what just even hit me?
[104:30.25]Wish I knew how much health I had.
[104:32.03]Wish I could see.
[104:41.17]Oh boy, this is not gonna be good.
[104:44.19]Move so slow!
[104:56.08]What the fuck?
[104:57.26]What did I do?
[104:59.14]Did I just drop a bomb?
[105:02.25]No.
[105:05.35]I think I just dropped a bomb somehow.
[105:08.61]What the fuck did I press?
[105:17.05]It's not bound to something else, is it?
[105:18.47]Hopefully not.
[105:19.50]No.
[105:36.03]Oh my goodness.
[105:36.75]This is not going to be good.
[105:38.35]It's over.
[105:40.11]It's definitely over.
[105:48.33]Oh my god.
[105:48.71]I thought that was one of my... I seriously thought that was a familiar of mine somehow.
[105:54.52]He was getting blocked.
[105:55.66]He was part of my crew.
[106:12.12]Jeez.
[106:22.83]Keep going.
[106:32.17]I got the fly, that's good.
[106:39.43]Get them both.
[106:46.93]Down.
[106:47.57]We go down.
[106:48.15]No.
[106:49.83]Alright, so does anyone think that Star has said a word besides yes or no in the last 30 minutes?
[106:58.15]What do you want from me?
[107:01.71]Every time I say something, you just go, no.
[107:04.62]What do you want?
[107:05.52]No.
[107:06.60]I've said yes.
[107:09.92]Next time you're over here, I'm going to make my dog fucking bite you.
[107:14.14]He actually did last time.
[107:16.51]I didn't want to say anything.
[107:17.41]I have like this really like three inch deep like bite on my leg.
[107:35.93]Two, is it?
[107:36.41]I don't want the magician.
[107:37.75]I don't want the magician.
[107:48.36]Fire.
[107:50.94]Lightning.
[107:57.62]That's gonna be cool.
[107:59.14]Freeze effect.
[107:59.86]Let's go up.
[108:06.56]Up, up, up, up, up, up.
[108:17.28]Shit.
[108:30.20]Well, I don't... Wiggle Worm is really not doing anything.
[108:34.70]It's just kind of making funny little faces flying around.
[108:38.98]Otto, what's the matter?
[108:40.60]I think he wants to go out.
[108:42.06]Otto?
[108:42.90]Always wants to go out.
[108:45.50]Well, he wants to go out like every... Oh, Bob's brain, you fucking... Motherfuck.
[108:53.25]Bob's brain.
[108:55.63]Did it again.
[108:58.05]My dog's like freaking out over here.
[109:01.65]Wait a minute.
[109:02.45]We'll go in a minute.
[109:05.42]That was very necessary.
[109:06.36]I just got that.
[109:07.20]Very good.
[109:15.82]Bob's brain.
[109:17.18]Bob, just get him.
[109:21.91]Well, there's the secret room.
[109:23.01]Cool.
[109:25.09]See, even I don't know the secret room.
[109:28.36]What do you want?
[109:49.13]I can get the other piece of the key, but I don't even know if I'm gonna... Can I kill this guy?
[109:54.80]Can I actually do this?
[109:55.70]I don't even know how much health I have.
[109:56.88]And I don't really remember their patterns.
[109:59.12]So it's probably extremely dangerous for a run that's probably not gonna go further than the Cathedral anyways.
[110:02.80]Do it.
[110:03.20]Do it.
[110:03.68]Do it.
[110:04.18]Do it.
[110:04.42]I don't know what you're doing, but do it.
[110:06.34]I did it.
[110:07.44]I did it, and I'm gonna lose.
[110:10.96]Zazel's real hard.
[110:14.33]I just don't even see.
[110:15.99]I just see what I'm talking about.
[110:16.89]I don't even know what he does.
[110:18.43]I don't see.
[110:19.17]I don't see.
[110:24.98]Okay.
[110:26.60]I'll have the key.
[110:34.30]I'll take a million bombs.
[110:39.18]Let's go in the other room.
[110:42.82]Greed!
[110:47.52]That's a lot of money.
[110:51.47]I'm gonna get so many bombs.
[110:56.25]Alright, I might... Auto!
[110:58.95]Auto, you made me just get hit by a bomb.
[111:02.14]No.
[111:02.84]Auto!
[111:05.14]I thought I was totally safe in here.
[111:07.12]And I turn around, I'm like, oh, Auto.
[111:09.28]And I turn back, there's a giant troll bomb on me.
[111:15.81]I was gonna say, I might have to, uh, take a small break here in the next minute or two.
[111:22.28]No.
[111:22.64]I need to let him out.
[111:27.08]I need to go.
[111:28.28]I gotta eat or something.
[111:30.53]I'm gonna have, like, breakfast.
[111:31.93]I'm sorry.
[111:33.41]Alright, get out of here.
[111:34.83]Fucking caveman's gone.
[111:37.67]Can we get rid of this guy that said the same word for the last, like, 40 minutes?
[111:43.54]Alright, yeah, I gotta, uh, I gotta take him outside.
[111:46.92]So, I, uh, I will be back in five minutes.
[111:53.46]Go get yourself a snack.
[111:55.45]Go, see?
[111:56.69]He's like, hey!
[111:58.45]I'll be back.
[111:59.27]See you guys in a few minutes.
[112:03.49]Come on, dog, let's go.
[119:37.60]Hello.
[119:42.26]Hello.
[119:42.82]Alright, so where were we?
[119:46.53]What happened here?
[119:47.07]I already got rid of the boss, right?
[119:53.17]Oh, I lost my chat.
[119:55.99]I lost my chat.
[120:01.57]There it is.
[120:11.26]auto come here auto auto come here alright it was in here I got the key piece in there I did everything in here yeah pretty much let's just go will I be regularly streaming yes
[120:43.62]Give me my keys back.
[120:45.01]Very good.
[120:46.31]Yeah, I plan on doing it like... I don't think it's going to happen.
[120:49.19]I have two lives.
[120:51.37]This is the first area where I haven't had Curse of the Unknown, isn't it?
[120:56.07]Besides the very beginning of the game.
[121:00.26]The health-wise, at least.
[121:03.18]Well, that unlocks everything.
[121:05.84]I can't even tell where the hell I'm going.
[121:11.32]I mean, it's not going to be every single day.
[121:15.72]But it will be at least... I'd say probably at least three or four times a week.
[121:21.85]What I want to try to do.
[121:29.72]Broken remote.
[121:30.64]I kind of like the bombs.
[121:31.38]That means I can spam them.
[121:39.50]Get down to 25.
[121:41.68]24.
[121:41.70]23.
[121:41.72]22.
[121:43.14]We'll get down to 20.
[121:47.26]Okay.
[121:51.79]Goodbye.
[121:55.79]I can see forever.
[122:05.74]I wish I could actually even know where I was going.
[122:09.20]I've helped immensely.
[122:22.51]I got faster somehow too.
[122:23.53]Oh shit.
[122:24.13]I was going to say I got faster somehow.
[122:35.01]A lot of them in this room.
[122:36.29]Usually there's more than like two.
[122:49.79]Listen to the advice of the... yeah.
[122:52.34]The fortune teller.
[123:00.51]Little fucking spider.
[123:10.75]Jeez, man.
[123:12.06]We all opened up at once.
[123:19.32]Everything opens.
[123:20.76]Don't have to worry about that.
[123:25.18]Well, I can use this now.
[123:30.83]That doesn't matter because I can't see anything anyways.
[123:34.57]What was this up here?
[123:35.49]Death.
[123:37.25]Let's just do it and see where we end up.
[123:41.67]All the way at the beginning.
[123:47.05]That brings you to the beginning, doesn't it?
[123:48.43]Something like that.
[123:52.47]Well, we're going to walk around with the death card for now.
[123:56.84]Because I can use it to clear a room, pretty much.
[124:07.42]Infinite keys.
[124:09.06]I love it.
[124:12.17]Suicide King is going to ruin the run.
[124:13.43]Probably.
[124:13.95]Although I still think it's going to be Bob.
[124:21.00]Secret room opened up because of the... I see everything.
[124:23.40]What the hell is it?
[124:28.14]Am I crazy?
[124:31.30]Yeah, there it is.
[124:40.63]Jesus man, for super greed, he dropped like five coins.
[124:47.05]That's not even super greed.
[124:50.06]That's like I'm broke.
[124:55.60]You'd think super greed would have like five grand.
[125:02.95]Fairly certain this is the item that like disconnects you.
[125:06.97]Right?
[125:09.63]No, I want to keep Krampus's head.
[125:11.95]It's too valuable.
[125:28.98]Now I'm moving around like I should be.
[125:30.68]I was a slug before.
[125:52.43]The shears?
[125:52.90]The shears, yeah, but... I just like... Krampus' head is just so good in every way.
[126:05.28]It's just so, so, so good.
[126:08.48]Krampus' card is just oh shit.
[126:10.92]Krampus' card.
[126:11.59]Krampus' head is just a gigantic oh shit button.
[126:14.81]You are guaranteed to be okay.
[126:19.53]You get in a bad situation, you're gonna get out of that situation if you have Krampus' head immediately.
[126:28.21]No, it's one little shit in the middle.
[126:29.43]Fucking Bob.
[126:34.07]It's always gonna be Bob.
[126:39.68]That's good.
[126:46.16]Giant spiders and flies.
[126:47.98]Let's do it.
[126:58.74]I want gigantic monsters.
[127:07.54]Well, this is going to be great for you.
[127:10.36]Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[127:16.30]Slow down.
[127:17.08]He's taking up too many.
[127:17.86]Oh, he's just going to suck them all up, isn't he?
[127:25.02]Where are these coming from?
[127:30.04]He is shitting his own hearts out and eating them.
[127:35.52]How many times are you going to do this, man?
[127:38.89]Not one spirit heart?
[127:39.97]Really?
[127:40.93]Really?
[127:41.93]Really?
[127:43.37]No.
[127:44.67]That just happened.
[127:54.40]No, nothing else in there I want.
[128:07.81]Oh, that room can only spawn red hearts.
[128:09.51]Alright, I'm getting lost.
[128:23.96]It's down, isn't it?
[128:29.46]Okay, now ship me out a good one.
[128:33.50]Thank you.
[128:46.98]Bob, please do not mess this up.
[128:49.60]I appreciate it.
[128:59.22]Ah, okay.
[129:00.32]So I figured out what I'm going to be using.
[129:05.98]That's one room recharge.
[129:07.52]It's pretty much just Krampus' head.
[129:09.12]But in small spaces.
[129:12.82]I think I'm going to hold on to that.
[129:17.23]That's a tough one.
[129:17.81]Because this is like a whole room and this is everything around me.
[129:20.91]I prefer bosses too.
[129:21.83]This will melt bosses.
[129:23.25]I'm going to hold on to it.
[129:43.55]Oh, yeah.
[129:45.43]Oh, yeah.
[129:49.93]We don't even need to worry about that anymore.
[129:51.82]What do you got for me?
[129:54.82]Nothing?
[130:02.32]Still have this bomb thing.
[130:09.22]Alright, things are looking up.
[130:10.82]Things are definitely looking up.
[130:15.68]Did I miss anything in here?
[130:22.52]I don't think I have anything I can get here.
[130:25.90]If there is, whatever.
[130:26.70]See ya.
[130:30.46]Goodbye.
[130:32.77]Goodbye.
[130:37.13]Bye.
[130:38.73]I'll take that.
[130:39.39]I already have the key, so this is me.
[130:43.49]No, I don't want to put a bomb here.
[130:46.84]Unless it's some super extra, extra secret thing that I don't know about.
[130:50.00]There's nothing else that you need here besides the key.
[130:53.34]I don't think.
[130:55.40]Let me take a sip of my iced coffee and we'll discuss it.
[131:05.11]Ah.
[131:08.44]I guess technically, whatever.
[131:09.38]Can kind of just instantly kill whatever it is.
[131:14.80]I'll just do the Tammy head.
[131:19.36]So I win.
[131:21.34]But if we're curious or not, I win.
[131:23.55]I'm going to win the game.
[131:26.71]So, fear not.
[131:29.13]I don't even have to use any other items.
[131:38.55]The one thing that's going to mess this up at this point is Bob.
[131:41.75]So, remember what I said in the very beginning.
[131:47.04]Bob is the only thing that can screw this up at this point.
[131:54.72]Two lives.
[131:56.97]I should at least get to the cathedral again.
[132:06.78]Oh my goodness, what the hell was I thinking?
[132:08.12]I was so... Look, right there, I was so scared of Bob that I, like, turned around so I wouldn't shoot it.
[132:12.90]And I ended up running into the guy.
[132:18.90]But, like, Bob can't go through rocks, so... Stop worrying about Bob.
[132:32.27]I think I'll be alright.
[132:33.15]Dark Bomb is gonna be feeding me this whole time, too.
[132:46.72]Pick it up.
[132:51.74]Oh, forget about that room.
[132:54.22]Ooh, get that.
[132:54.82]Nice.
[132:59.30]Giant spider.
[133:06.37]Don't touch that, right?
[133:08.27]From what I remember.
[133:10.27]Isn't that the thing that makes it so it's like the monkey paw, right?
[133:12.97]Whatever it is.
[133:14.71]I'm scared of it.
[133:38.56]Whoa!
[133:39.70]Those things just insta-attacked.
[133:49.05]Get away from me!
[134:00.03]I don't need, if that's red chests, I don't need that.
[134:04.06]I'm in a really, really, really, really good position.
[134:07.31]Don't want to screw it up now by doing something else.
[134:09.55]Like opening up a red chest and dying or something.
[134:11.53]Let's go.
[134:22.64]Kind of wasteful, but I really got just scared.
[134:25.36]And this boss is extremely easy, so I'm okay with it.
[134:31.78]Apparently one of those hit me.
[134:41.02]Damage and range up.
[134:42.06]Nice.
[134:44.71]Two of diamonds?
[134:46.41]Sure, I'll take more.
[134:47.17]Oh, it's the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[134:54.34]No.
[134:54.50]Actually, I might as well just use it to see what it does.
[134:57.48]Oh!
[135:02.20]Did you see what that did?
[135:03.58]Alright, we're gonna do this too.
[135:05.91]For fun.
[135:09.63]Yeah, I haven't really gotten any of the good angel room items.
[135:31.10]Bob almost did it again.
[135:44.14]Hmm, making strides.
[135:49.66]I have the mask, too.
[135:51.84]Keep forgetting that.
[136:00.05]So many items.
[136:07.60]Setting a record two days in a row.
[136:08.84]Yeah, this is unheard of.
[136:19.26]the arcade.
[136:20.70]I can just dump all my... You know, I actually really hope it's... I get something.
[136:26.60]I hope I get the fly out of this.
[136:28.38]The fly head thing.
[136:29.26]Oh, shit!
[136:29.96]Bob!
[136:30.80]Bob!
[136:31.42]Bob!
[136:31.96]I know you're, like, addicted to gambling and you freaked out and you ran right at the machine, but calm down.
[136:42.12]That was bad.
[136:43.08]I can't get rid of that.
[136:45.24]I have to wait till it flies over here.
[137:00.50]But the big... I don't even know.
[137:04.68]This might even be a waste of time.
[137:06.80]Good.
[137:07.02]More coins.
[137:08.46]And more bombs.
[137:12.04]I'm going to max out on everything.
[137:15.56]That's good.
[137:16.08]I need that.
[137:17.58]Of course, I don't get it.
[137:20.76]It actually might be worth trying to get hearts here.
[137:28.29]So, hope you guys get comfortable.
[137:30.62]We're gonna be here for a little while.
[137:34.52]We only have 70 more times to do this.
[137:38.15]Fucking... Stupid fucking item.
[137:57.13]Great.
[137:58.11]Luck done.
[138:03.65]So we accomplished nothing there and I lost a heart.
[138:06.06]I'm glad.
[138:10.90]I'm glad it worked out so well.
[138:12.26]That was fantastic.
[138:21.36]Please get that.
[138:24.89]This is good.
[138:28.11]I don't know what this does.
[138:30.05]I don't know.
[138:30.53]I'm not... I'll look over at chat in a second.
[138:34.69]I'll figure that out.
[138:35.87]But I don't want to step on that.
[138:40.29]What are these pills?
[138:41.35]Health up.
[138:42.83]Absolutely.
[138:44.43]And...
[139:01.06]Oh my god, that item is... I'm looking over and laughing at what Star said.
[139:06.61]And then Bob hits me again.
[139:25.39]It's the worst, too, because having Bob's head with brimstone, a short brimstone, you have to get close.
[139:33.25]It's just a terrible, terrible combination.
[139:36.32]One I would not recommend.
[139:37.38]Let's just go.
[139:54.17]Let's go.
[140:00.64]This should be fairly straightforward.
[140:14.79]Just watch out for Bob.
[140:17.05]He's gonna spawn any second.
[140:19.03]There he is.
[140:19.49]Go ahead, Bob.
[140:22.87]Go do your thing.
[140:23.67]Oh, my God.
[140:26.23]See, I'm, like, playing around Bob.
[140:35.21]Robert.
[140:46.62]Uh, paperclip.
[140:48.46]Well, whatever it is.
[140:49.16]Whoa!
[140:52.26]One of these rooms.
[141:11.36]Continue!
[141:26.38]Knew that was gonna happen.
[141:43.68]By... Sure, I'll take it.
[141:53.88]No, I didn't expect that to happen.
[141:58.88]Alright, I'm doing Fall Bob.
[142:00.59]I have to, right?
[142:06.77]Drop a spider on me.
[142:09.01]Drop spiders on me.
[142:15.61]Where's the secret?
[142:20.38]The void.
[142:20.84]That's cool.
[142:36.79]Woohoo!
[142:43.85]Another spider!
[142:47.25]Don't want that.
[142:56.80]Bob's back.
[143:00.46]Bob might actually be pretty not terrible.
[143:02.99]Shit.
[143:04.37]Alright, no more talking.
[143:15.60]Alright.
[143:17.14]Let's keep going.
[143:20.15]Into the chest.
[143:22.21]I have everything I need.
[143:24.41]It opens.
[143:31.91]The prey.
[143:37.99]Now I wonder... I wonder... If it's worth...
[143:47.06]Reasonable Eternity.
[143:47.84]Might as well just do it, right?
[143:52.47]Unicorn Horn.
[143:53.31]I mean, here's what I feel, right?
[144:02.47]I can only do Tammy's Head one time in here.
[144:09.46]And the Unicorn Horn might save my life.
[144:11.44]You know what I mean?
[144:20.35]Whatever.
[144:21.07]Let's go.
[144:25.59]Let's go, Mega Satan.
[144:26.55]You think I'm scared?
[144:30.92]Instaloos.
[144:46.23]Get him, Bob.
[144:49.18]Oh shit!
[144:51.61]Forgot about this part.
[144:59.67]Die!
[145:24.95]Gotta be quiet here.
[145:40.85]I can fly.
[145:42.21]But it's okay.
[145:42.81]It's good to prepare.
[145:43.87]For practice sake.
[146:14.74]Get away from me.
[146:58.08]Fuck you, Satan.
[147:28.02]We know about that.
[147:29.51]We know about that, Satan.
[147:30.81]We know about that.
[147:31.49]Let's go!
[147:41.27]Fuck you!
[147:46.62]Ugh!
[147:53.28]Bob!
[147:54.10]Bob, don't kill me!
[148:11.14]Stop doing this.
[148:18.14]See you later.
[148:21.08]Get out of town.
[148:22.80]Get away from me.
[148:25.40]I win.
[148:33.07]Mega Satan, you're dead.
[148:42.20]Yeah, the mask really did, like, save me so many times.
[148:55.27]Well, I feel like...
[148:59.49]Wow, I totally didn't believe in you at all.
[149:02.17]Do you see what happened when I stopped talking?
[149:05.75]When I silenced out and I just played the game?
[149:13.44]Yeah, the mask was totally, like, fantastic right there.
[149:16.30]If I didn't have the mask, I would have lost.
[149:20.20]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[149:24.24]I'll do it again.
[149:24.80]I'll do...
[149:32.19]I'll do one of these.
[149:33.95]Which one of these haven't I done?
[149:37.61]I'll try one of these.
[149:38.33]Waka Waka.
[149:46.38]Oh, it's this one.
[149:47.46]It's the one where you have the... Oh, boy.
[149:51.08]This is so dumb.
[149:55.56]It's magnetized tears.
[150:00.56]How far do you have to get in this one?
[150:03.58]Do you just have to get to the foot?
[150:06.38]Or is it further?
[150:19.71]Tears up here would be amazing.
[150:21.11]Except I don't like how they're flying all over the place.
[150:30.42]He just went across both sides of the room.
[150:32.64]That was awesome.
[150:44.31]Oh boy, I'm stuck in this corner.
[150:52.37]Is there a boss beyond Mega Satan?
[150:55.38]Um... I thought... Mega Satan's like the final boss, right?
[151:03.46]And then isn't there like an optional super boss or something?
[151:06.18]He is like the super boss, right?
[151:17.36]I'll try and get something in here.
[151:20.12]Might have been worth it.
[151:25.14]Well, that was actually good because it teleported me out and into the... Of course, it has to be troll bombs.
[151:32.44]I'm back to full health, so that's a good thing.
[151:43.05]Dingle.
[151:43.51]This is not going to be good.
[151:44.29]He's going to fly all over the place.
[151:47.77]I gotta be patient with this one.
[152:02.26]Shit.
[152:06.80]Waka waka.
[152:14.20]Oh boy, what am I doing?
[152:14.90]I'm looking at chat.
[152:15.50]That wasn't good.
[152:17.01]That wasn't good.
[152:20.12]I need damage or something.
[152:21.10]These are doing no damage.
[152:22.30]Maybe I'm just so used to how much damage I was doing as Azazel.
[152:30.31]Last time.
[152:30.79]Oh boy.
[152:34.79]This is actually much harder than I thought it was going to be because I'm focused almost 100% on where the balls are and not on anything else.
[152:43.34]Oh boy.
[152:45.26]Well, let's try it again.
[152:47.60]Now that I understand what I shouldn't be doing, this should be not as hard.
[152:52.42]You know what?
[152:52.70]What am I doing?
[152:53.90]I can just do this.
[152:54.56]You can just actually shoot them.
[153:00.08]What the hell was I doing?
[153:02.98]I'm trying to play the game like Pac-Man style.
[153:05.46]You can just use it as a regular tier.
[153:19.11]See, now for stuff like this, yeah.
[153:20.75]There's a heart here.
[153:29.77]I'll get the curse.
[153:42.50]Duppy's tail.
[153:44.08]Sure, I'll take it.
[153:46.58]Maybe I can turn into Guppy during this and not have to worry about anything anymore.
[153:54.61]I probably should just go up.
[153:58.13]Just in case there's something.
[154:02.35]One time.
[154:03.90]One more time.
[154:05.90]Nope.
[154:09.82]Too bad.
[154:17.20]Don't want to miss any rocks, tinted rocks or anything.
[154:19.90]Got to be very aware of those.
[154:31.24]Well, that was a bust.
[154:31.92]There's like nothing in here.
[154:53.11]Of course it has to be another guy that moves around real fast.
[155:00.20]First Dingle, now these guys.
[155:01.56]Shit.
[155:17.61]It sucks because I'm making them faster.
[155:29.00]They're like lightning.
[155:36.79]I don't know.
[155:37.17]I don't think I can do this one.
[155:38.67]This one hurts my head too much.
[155:44.73]Jeez.
[155:46.81]Yeah, I don't know about that, man.
[155:49.81]I'll give it one more try.
[155:51.44]Hopefully I don't get the enemies that fly across the screen.
[155:54.56]Let's go to Tinted Rock.
[156:01.29]Great.
[156:17.00]No, I'm looking at chat again.
[156:20.64]You can always tell I'm looking at chat, because I'll get hit by something that, if you're standing still, you should never ever get hit by it.
[156:28.85]Like, I'll walk into fires and stuff because I'm like, let's look over here.
[156:34.23]That's why I gotta get that thing that's embedded in the game.
[156:36.97]Kind of.
[156:37.43]Like, on the screen.
[156:39.29]That'd make my life so much easier.
[156:40.76]Oh, boy.
[157:00.81]Don't you have, like, something to do, Star?
[157:04.37]I thought you were, like, making a video.
[157:08.35]For the first time in, like, three months.
[157:10.79]How's that going?
[157:13.75]You prick.
[157:20.94]Oh my god!
[157:21.88]Look at this, watch this, ready?
[157:23.88]I don't even give a shit.
[157:24.62]I don't even care if I lose, this is gonna be fun.
[157:30.04]He's just gonna rip around the map.
[157:40.73]Fly around.
[157:41.37]Fly all over the place, I don't care.
[157:54.93]That was crazy.
[158:08.22]uh secret room secret oh my god what secrets are in here pills give me them oh puberty
[158:39.21]You're at the last level in the swindle.
[158:41.79]How hard is it at the very end?
[158:43.98]It's so... It's frustrating.
[158:47.16]I want to help.
[158:47.60]How big are the areas at the end of that game?
[158:49.78]Do they get bigger?
[158:50.86]Or are they still kind of in the same... spectrum of largeness?
[159:11.17]Come on, I need, give me more coins!
[159:14.88]Give me more, give me more poop coins, please!
[159:22.40]So whatever happens on this run, I think, I think I'm going to be done streaming for the day.
[159:28.30]Because I want to make a video.
[159:30.23]I have a video I need to make.
[159:40.20]Come on.
[159:41.08]Follow the trail.
[159:51.79]Follow your nose.
[160:01.97]No keys.
[160:04.52]Dang it.
[160:23.23]There's a key.
[160:24.77]I should probably use it.
[160:32.55]Two coins in a golden chest.
[160:38.05]That's bull.
[160:39.57]That's bull crap.
[160:45.51]How long does it take to make a video?
[160:46.55]It depends.
[160:48.85]Sometimes like a couple hours, sometimes like nine days.
[160:54.67]Depends on what I want to do.
[160:55.55]If it's going to be just like a general video, or if I want to do like a... This is a scarier room.
[161:09.15]Follow the trail, just follow it.
[161:10.84]Follow it, follow it, follow it.
[161:19.42]Can I like glitch this through?
[161:20.34]No.
[161:31.77]Wasn't there a tinted rock somewhere?
[161:33.85]Really?
[161:35.59]It's not where the secret room is?
[161:43.35]Yeah, but I mean, different videos have different... Sometimes I'll make a video, and I'll sit on it for so long.
[161:52.75]Like an extra four days and be like, no, I want to do this.
[161:56.17]I don't like that.
[161:57.27]I want to do this.
[162:02.61]Sometimes videos just get canned entirely.
[162:04.67]I just didn't like them.
[162:07.49]I'm sitting on a video right now that's been done.
[162:09.95]It's done.
[162:11.40]It's rendered and it's ready to upload.
[162:13.00]And I haven't uploaded it.
[162:14.40]And it's been there for like two weeks.
[162:15.76]Because I just don't... I'm not a fan.
[162:18.72]You know what I mean?
[162:22.58]Great.
[162:23.12]Tears down.
[162:23.96]Tears down with this is not something I want.
[162:26.45]It must be up here.
[162:38.86]Okay, well, that's the two obvious places.
[162:42.58]And I don't want to waste another bomb.
[162:48.61]Tinted rock.
[163:01.16]Come on up here.
[163:02.00]Come on up here.
[163:11.78]My magnum opus?
[163:12.76]No.
[163:13.14]This video is not my magnum opus.
[163:21.42]But it's been done for a while.
[163:22.44]And I just was like, I don't like it.
[163:25.90]I don't want to put it up.
[163:35.82]Depending on what's in this devil room.
[163:40.80]Well...
[163:42.72]Ooh, wait a second.
[163:46.00]Did I?
[163:50.50]Do I have guppies?
[163:51.48]No, that was the last one.
[163:52.64]Damn it.
[163:52.96]200, 280p.
[164:19.98]I'm just reading chat.
[164:22.55]I'm figuring out which to respond to.
[164:30.69]The hairball is kind of... Yeah.
[164:33.71]At least I can actually go like this and hit things.
[164:42.22]So... It's too bad because I picked up Guppy's tail.
[164:49.20]I don't think I want the gimp thing.
[164:53.24]It's too much health to give up.
[164:56.34]There's pee party.
[165:01.52]Oh, fine.
[165:02.76]Fine.
[165:04.26]I'll get it.
[165:07.94]I'll take it all.
[165:18.19]Caves extra large.
[165:25.63]I am desperate for damage.
[165:27.11]I'm not going to be able to kill any bosses like this.
[165:32.62]In fact, I'm not even sure if I'm going to be able to hurt the next boss.
[165:35.10]I don't even know why I'm moving.
[165:54.97]Oh, come on.
[165:57.00]How did I get hit by that?
[165:58.06]I like watched that happen in slow motion.
[166:01.94]It's like my brain's frame rate went down to like six.
[166:13.90]What's, what's, what's, I'm a reptile?
[166:16.91]Everyone's like, you're, oh, I dream of the reptilian.
[166:19.01]What does that even mean?
[166:21.47]I've seen that like a few times now.
[166:25.16]Am I like a Skyrim character?
[167:03.80]Die.
[167:14.98]Let's go.
[167:20.25]Boy, this is not going to end well.
[167:23.61]Yeah, I just need to hit him with the... I'm just going to do that.
[167:38.10]Do it.
[167:38.60]Oh, boy.
[167:39.08]No, it's over.
[167:39.54]There's no way.
[167:42.78]Yeah.
[167:43.80]No, there's nothing I can do about that one.
[167:47.36]Is there any health on the ground?
[167:49.58]There's two bosses here.
[167:50.58]Actually, I need to go look.
[167:53.24]I need to find health.
[168:05.91]Slingshot it.
[168:13.46]This thing's at max now, right?
[168:15.04]I think so.
[168:22.26]Oh, this is an opportunity for health.
[168:24.94]Let's hope there's health in here.
[168:27.37]Nope.
[168:27.81]Two coins again.
[168:28.89]Two coins again!
[168:38.29]Just two coins.
[168:52.47]Just gonna stand all the way back here.
[168:57.14]Gonna un-launch the barrage.
[168:58.50]I missed most of those.
[169:07.94]This is real bad.
[169:12.75]Make a circle!
[169:14.09]Make a giant circle!
[169:15.63]That's all that matters.
[169:26.58]Alright.
[169:37.46]Wow.
[169:38.62]Okay.
[169:39.58]Half a heart.
[169:47.37]Game over.
[169:49.23]This is game over.
[169:49.81]I'm gonna get stuck in there.
[169:50.81]No, I'm not.
[169:51.21]Holy crap.
[169:52.23]That was close.
[170:16.12]Hit him!
[170:16.78]Hit him with the thing!
[170:17.45]Come on, just get right behind me.
[170:30.75]He's stuck on a rock.
[170:40.37]Hearts.
[170:41.39]Yes.
[170:42.53]Oh, thank goodness.
[170:43.61]Okay, let's go.
[170:44.37]Let's try this again.
[170:46.23]Another attempt.
[170:52.94]Net failure.
[170:59.48]Just going all of rock.
[171:01.90]And nothing else.
[171:26.41]Shit he's getting he's just I can't hit him with it because it's just too flying around and flopping around Let's just go whatever When they get small like that it's very hard to hit them because the circumference of this thing Will you stop?
[171:51.13]Stop flying and do another animation.
[171:52.97]Do anything else.
[172:07.41]Jeez.
[172:13.99]Oh, God.
[172:16.89]Oh, boy.
[172:17.51]That's hard.
[172:18.77]That was not going to happen.
[172:28.01]What are some of the other challenges that I haven't done?
[172:31.97]Solar system.
[172:41.25]Where's the family man?
[172:47.39]Oh, it's only familiars.
[172:52.12]You can't do anything?
[172:52.82]That's funny.
[173:00.73]We're gonna lose.
[173:02.32]This is the last one.
[173:03.32]Gonna mess around.
[173:12.42]I think with this one you have to get all the way, don't you?
[173:14.58]Seems like I can actually hit things.
[173:42.73]Just go.
[173:47.31]In case I need to run, I'll open the door with the key.
[173:59.82]You have to go to Isaac with the family man?
[174:01.87]Oh.
[174:02.59]My.
[174:03.31]God.
[174:07.15]So how is this possible?
[174:08.17]How do you do this?
[174:09.61]You just have to get a ton of... I don't even know.
[174:13.34]What would you even get to make this doable?
[174:46.77]99 bombs?
[174:48.16]I could see that.
[174:51.28]Just spam rooms with bombs.
[174:53.30]Or get one of the blast damage things, or get the tear bomb thing.
[174:57.42]I could see how that would work.
[175:01.40]Yeah, this is by no means a serious run.
[175:03.70]I'm not trying to win.
[175:04.68]I just wanted to see what it actually was.
[175:09.58]Come to think of it, probably none of these have been serious.
[175:15.33]Wow!
[175:20.52]What's left?
[175:20.90]These guys are stuck over here?
[175:22.60]Yeah, they are.
[175:24.76]Open up.
[175:33.01]I don't care about that room.
[175:42.05]Piggy bank.
[175:47.61]Can't pass up free rooms.
[176:02.05]Alright, let's just get the boss.
[176:08.37]I want that stuff down there.
[176:09.27]It's important.
[176:10.50]Have to get it.
[176:23.81]Don't kill me.
[176:31.89]Oh, okay.
[176:39.78]This actually would be pretty fun.
[176:41.04]If you could get the right things and make this crazy.
[176:50.21]Although... Getting to Isaac seems like it'd be pretty impossible.
[177:00.02]Hey Krampus.
[177:01.66]Fuck you, I can just leave.
[177:06.61]I'm trying to find reasons to just stop playing this, but I mean... I'm kind of like... Whatever, let's just go.
[177:15.14]Let's just go till I die.
[177:16.98]I'm very much planning on dying, so... I'm not going for secrets, I'm not going for items items, we're just going as fast as we can to the bosses and see what happens.
[177:34.40]pretty hilarious if I actually got all the way through this and beat the whole thing just playing like a dirt bag and not even trying just being an idiot just getting the default items and not even caring and like walking into spiders and their webs and the two times two separate occasions you know
[178:17.35]I just keep getting hearts.
[178:19.58]I want to lose.
[178:23.06]Something keeps pulling me back in.
[178:24.34]It's fate.
[178:46.18]No, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[178:51.44]Hit the one bomb.
[178:53.50]You hit everything but the bomb.
[178:55.62]Well, there's that.
[178:56.58]I can go in the secret room.
[178:57.30]That's cool.
[178:59.95]Look at all these hearts.
[179:00.63]Look at all these hearts.
[179:01.39]Oh, wow.
[179:10.90]I beat you, peep.
[179:20.54]Would you accidentally beat this?
[179:24.59]That's what I'm saying, man.
[179:26.69]It's possible.
[179:29.05]It's possible that I will accidentally beat one of the hardest challenges in the game.
[179:35.69]I would say that it's up there around probably like... I'd say it's about a 1% chance that that'll happen.
[179:42.88]Maybe less.
[179:52.05]I don't even need to fight these guys.
[179:53.25]Bye.
[179:58.77]I guess if you have the key, you can kind of just open doors and walk out, right?
[180:03.65]Is that part of the strategy for this?
[180:04.71]You're just like, I'm just going to skip this room.
[180:13.21]On purpose.
[180:14.12]I did that on purpose.
[180:15.96]So we can just get out of that
[180:30.20]I like the fly baby.
[180:31.96]Shoots out the flies.
[180:33.53]Actually works pretty well in a lot of cases.
[180:36.59]Many cases.
[180:46.96]Come on, everybody get up there.
[180:51.24]I don't want this guy bouncing around.
[180:57.62]I actually thought that was one of the bullets coming from her face.
[181:08.89]Now, can I get another one of these?
[181:10.31]Like, will I get another one dropped?
[181:12.61]So I can have, like, two brothers or two sisters or whatever.
[181:19.15]Take a look, guys.
[181:21.32]Bob's brain.
[181:23.42]And it's huge.
[181:25.84]It's gigantic Bob's brain.
[181:29.77]This is a win.
[181:32.30]The world is trying to tell me something.
[181:33.84]It says, hey, you don't like Bob's brain?
[181:37.46]You thought Bob's brain sucked?
[181:38.98]Well, now it's going to win you the whole game.
[181:47.77]We'll see how this goes.
[182:03.23]open don't care about anything else all I care about is giant Bob's brain I'll take that let's go
[182:32.55]These guys jump, don't they?
[182:34.71]Do they have an opportunity to jump?
[182:35.91]Let's go, Bob.
[182:43.74]Shit.
[182:44.24]I was trying.
[182:44.70]I didn't think he was going to do that.
[182:52.40]This is going to be exceptionally difficult to even hit him.
[182:55.20]Could just do that.
[183:08.95]Let's go.
[183:14.25]I'm actually really glad I had Krampus Head.
[183:15.67]I didn't want to use it, but sometimes you just have to.
[183:33.50]Super Bob.
[183:35.68]Is Bob's brain explosions, like the explosion, bomb, blast damage items?
[183:41.35]Does it affect Bob?
[183:41.93]Because if it does, then that would be pretty cool to get that.
[183:57.81]It is really easy to forget about Krampus's head.
[184:03.38]Takes so long to recharge, you just forget you have it.
[184:09.36]These three things came out of the skulls or something?
[184:11.76]What the hell?
[184:12.34]This is so awkward.
[184:15.12]Can't go anywhere.
[184:15.82]Oh god, fuck what just happened in this room.
[184:20.61]Seriously.
[184:22.51]Oh dear.
[184:23.27]That was really annoying.
[184:46.99]Get out of my way.
[184:48.09]Get out of my way.
[184:56.90]Speed down.
[184:58.48]That's one of the worst things.
[185:00.52]I hate getting speed down.
[185:02.08]I hate it.
[185:04.06]It makes me so mad.
[185:12.41]Whatever.
[185:28.00]They look gish.
[185:36.18]Do I do it?
[185:36.82]No, I don't do it.
[185:37.86]I don't do it.
[185:40.53]I do not do it.
[185:41.67]I just need to get to Isaac.
[186:01.75]Boo.
[186:03.87]Boo.
[186:04.15]You didn't do the unnecessary thing.
[186:06.31]Boo.
[186:15.68]Little Gish is going to be good too.
[186:17.56]I'm not... This was just me joking around at first, but I think there's a very small chance.
[186:23.53]That 1% turned into like 6% now.
[186:32.31]of me actually being able to do this.
[186:36.91]I don't want to go that way if I don't have to.
[186:56.14]That might be worth taking now.
[187:14.62]Because that's going to... Yeah.
[187:20.32]I think I want it.
[187:23.82]I think I want it.
[187:29.28]Yeah.
[187:29.94]I'm going to take it.
[187:30.58]Because there's no chest anyways.
[187:47.01]These are my absolutely least favorite rooms in the whole game.
[187:51.23]Stuff like that.
[187:52.21]I hate that.
[187:56.59]Why am I Francis from Left 4 Dead today?
[187:59.14]I don't like that.
[188:00.02]I hate that.
[188:01.72]I'm not a fan.
[188:02.56]I don't like elevators.
[188:03.96]I don't like trains.
[188:05.18]I hate that.
[188:06.12]That's been me the last 25 minutes.
[188:21.12]Open your face.
[188:21.74]OK.
[188:34.62]Worth it.
[188:54.86]At least I can slow them.
[188:56.74]That is a good thing.
[189:05.21]Come on, all of you fat motherfuckers!
[189:10.89]Gotcha, you fat fuck!
[189:26.62]I don't like stairs.
[189:28.26]I hate you.
[189:29.58]And now I'm just turning into a beer.
[189:32.76]I wish they'd put a beer in a game.
[189:34.32]Like a real game.
[189:35.40]Like he gets his own GTA.
[189:37.06]I hope GTA 6 is a beer character.
[189:39.66]Is the main character.
[189:47.32]My head just tilted.
[189:49.56]I got so angry at that.
[189:50.92]I was so irritated at what just happened.
[189:52.68]My head just went sideways.
[189:59.93]Not these things shoot, they do.
[190:03.72]You can get spirit hearts from me still.
[190:07.96]Give me spirit hearts.
[190:09.60]Give them to me.
[190:12.27]Give me a spirit heart.
[190:13.91]Give me one!
[190:16.95]Ah, you...
[190:32.31]So many... I just ran into him.
[190:34.99]It's alright.
[190:35.73]We replenished all of our health.
[190:37.05]Because I blew up this rock that was over here.
[190:41.40]And then some.
[190:44.76]Getting some luck here.
[190:47.78]That's why you take Krampus' head.
[190:49.56]That is why you have Krampus' head.
[190:50.92]For exact situations like that.
[190:52.48]That is the... Oh, fuck.
[190:54.30]See?
[190:55.01]Again.
[190:56.91]That was the... Oh, shit.
[190:59.19]I'm going to take like nine points of damage in here.
[191:06.39]Okay, so here's the plan.
[191:07.87]No, that's a bad plan.
[191:09.29]That's a very bad plan.
[191:10.81]We're just gonna go.
[191:14.87]Yeah, we're just gonna go.
[191:20.53]Be careful in here.
[191:21.49]Don't do anything stupid.
[191:24.07]Just wait till you get Bob.
[191:32.25]Bob will take care of everything, like he always does.
[191:49.49]Shit.
[191:50.25]I didn't see the shadow.
[191:51.03]There's too many people standing in a circle.
[192:01.26]Damn it.
[192:01.78]I think I can get rid of this thing reliably.
[192:08.68]One last Bob.
[192:13.39]See you later.
[192:18.99]This is boss rush, right?
[192:22.23]Isn't that what this is?
[192:24.75]But it's not complete boss rush.
[192:26.91]It's you have to get to Isaac.
[192:44.28]Or can you complete it like that, too?
[192:50.41]Don't do it?
[192:51.81]Yeah, that's not a good idea.
[192:53.97]Let's just go.
[193:00.13]It would definitely kill me.
[193:01.71]There's no reason to do that.
[193:03.31]Especially if I'm... I haven't lost yet, so... What is that?
[193:20.92]The slow is very good too.
[193:22.34]It's really helping a lot.
[193:24.72]A large amount.
[193:35.09]This run really might be a question of... Bob Gibbeth.
[193:39.27]Bob taketh away.
[193:40.53]I almost said Bob Gibbous.
[193:59.75]I hate these enemies.
[194:00.95]With a passion.
[194:02.22]These are the worst.
[194:02.86]At least one of them is dead, right?
[194:15.45]No, I hit the door.
[194:17.47]Hit the door.
[194:18.83]Great.
[194:36.67]Hey, I got you Gibbous.
[194:37.77]I got you Gibbous right here.
[194:41.53]I knew it was gonna happen.
[194:44.37]Bob Gibbous.
[194:45.76]Bob taketh away.
[194:48.54]Should I do this?
[194:52.32]What's the one that re-rolls every item you have?
[194:55.06]Is that the one?
[195:01.96]What does the four do?
[195:03.08]So many things in this game.
[195:04.18]So many items in this game.
[195:05.04]So many different variables.
[195:09.99]I just saw a FUCK NO.
[195:12.25]Do it!
[195:25.62]Do it!
[195:26.46]Does this one do anything?
[195:34.45]It's not gonna help at all?
[195:35.59]Oh, well.
[195:42.95]Okay.
[195:44.47]We'll do the conservative play.
[195:46.97]And we just won't do it.
[195:49.51]Really hoping for Guppy.
[195:50.85]But, you know.
[196:04.20]Ah!
[196:04.92]Knew it was going to happen.
[196:05.62]Trying to hit him with Bob.
[196:12.76]Ah, God, this is tanking.
[196:16.39]Abandon ship, guys.
[196:21.05]Here comes the... Actually, hold on.
[196:23.71]Yeah, whatever.
[196:24.59]Don't care.
[196:30.08]How?
[196:31.34]Of all the things that I get hit by, I get hit by the things that are just like the stand... I just get hit by stuff.
[196:40.40]I don't know how to dodge moves.
[196:44.82]Is there a bullet coming at me?
[196:47.67]I don't know how to dodge that.
[196:50.17]Somebody teach me.
[196:51.31]Oh, you step one centimeter to your left.
[196:56.31]Good to know!
[197:00.33]Alright, calm down.
[197:01.95]Calm down.
[197:02.68]There's no reason to get upset about this.
[197:07.34]I'm getting upset because I've taken way too many points of damage, but the more angry you get, the more irritated you are, the worse you're going to do.
[197:16.27]That's a staple of every single video game ever made.
[197:19.83]There is a heart over there, though.
[197:22.21]I don't even want to deal with that.
[197:23.95]I don't even want to even think to deal with that.
[197:26.15]And I got a bad trip.
[197:35.25]I'm going to flip out.
[197:38.17]Blend it in with the ground.
[197:39.87]The red stuff on the ground.
[197:42.29]Well, now we need a prayer.
[197:46.26]We need a prayer.
[197:47.08]We need to throw a Hail Mary.
[197:53.27]Get the health down here and then it's time to bomb a pass down to the end zone.
[198:05.29]I'm not sure what that's gonna be.
[198:07.93]All I know is that... It's time to throw an end zone pass.
[198:17.16]Pass is going to the end zone!
[198:21.88]What'd that even do?
[198:27.99]Oh.
[198:29.23]Okay.
[198:45.43]Give me the secret.
[198:46.23]I'm going to stay over here.
[198:58.98]No, I can't even go that way.
[199:00.48]I guess I can, but no, I can't.
[199:03.24]What?
[199:09.81]I need that Krampus charge.
[199:17.67]These pills speed down, of course.
[199:25.00]Open this.
[199:27.18]Ah, there's nothing in there.
[199:32.01]There's one other section over here.
[199:35.17]And if I die, I die.
[199:36.15]But I do need to try to get a charge on Grandpa's head.
[199:41.77]Not enough rooms.
[199:43.19]Where is the secret?
[199:48.17]Up here?
[199:49.27]Down over this way?
[199:51.45]I can't even go down here.
[199:55.06]Jerma is a wiener.
[199:56.36]Hey!
[199:56.58]I'm not a wiener.
[199:58.24]Don't call me a wiener.
[200:13.78]We'll get a Bob.
[200:22.11]Trying to, yeah.
[200:23.01]The rocks in the womb are different, right?
[200:27.05]They're not tinted.
[200:27.85]They have like a little scratch on them or something.
[200:31.50]Like I'm desperate.
[200:32.46]I'm willing to look around in every room.
[200:35.80]I know there's some slight difference.
[200:37.66]They're much harder to detect down here, right?
[200:44.53]It's like an X on them.
[200:50.56]Because there is no chance I'm going to beat this.
[200:54.64]Without some type of, like, Hailberry.
[200:56.12]Now they have an X. Well, let's do some rock examining, in case I missed one.
[201:08.37]I don't see an X on any of these.
[201:16.96]No, I don't think there's any.
[201:19.94]Nope, it was just poo.
[201:26.71]I can't like farm these, right?
[201:28.07]Nothing pops out of these.
[201:29.25]Oh well.
[201:33.66]Well.
[201:40.30]The far right room you thought you saw one, really?
[201:44.45]We'll check that and then we're just going to go and whatever.
[201:46.87]We're going to lose, probably.
[201:50.00]But you know what?
[201:50.52]Losing is part of life.
[201:51.88]You lose so you can learn and get better to live another day.
[201:58.44]Okay.
[201:59.80]Somebody said that they thought they saw one down here.
[202:02.20]Well, who gives a shit?
[202:03.24]Let's blow it all up.
[202:04.03]Okay.
[202:09.63]What about these ones?
[202:10.37]Blow these up, too.
[202:11.09]No, let's just blow this whole place up.
[202:18.16]Maybe I'll just go over this way.
[202:23.13]Alright, well, I'm done stalling.
[202:24.77]It's time to go.
[202:28.23]Yeah, I remember when I did say I didn't care about this run.
[202:30.01]You're right.
[202:38.71]Okay, none of these.
[202:41.99]Alright.
[202:42.68]Cross your fingers.
[202:43.22]Let's go.
[202:50.84]The cage.
[203:06.09]Speed it down, Pills.
[203:07.23]Let's do it.
[203:10.32]That's exactly what I was trying to do there.
[203:13.94]Because now I can move a little bit slower and a little bit more dedicated and a little bit more controlled with that speed down.
[203:22.94]You see, you all thought that was a mistake.
[203:27.84]See how much more controlled and total control of my body I am right now?
[203:56.26]Oh well.
[204:00.49]Oh well, who cares.
[204:05.79]It was fun.
[204:09.25]So this next run, this next one, I'm going to do with my eyes closed.
[204:15.29]Okay.
[204:15.53]Let me try to do this with... Put this on normal.
[204:28.63]Yeah, it was just eyes closed.
[204:30.69]Random.
[204:34.73]I'm not even going to look.
[204:41.04]Webcam so we can verify.
[204:43.20]I'm going to put my eye up.
[204:44.64]My eyes are going to be closed.
[204:50.08]Hold on.
[204:50.52]Hold on a second.
[204:51.12]We'll do this.
[204:59.80]Why would he take the speed down, Phil?
[205:01.45]I don't know, because that was funny.
[205:06.91]Why would he do that?
[205:08.09]I don't even know if I can set my webcam up.
[205:13.87]No, that's just not happening.
[205:16.31]Well, you know what?
[205:18.03]It's over.
[205:20.63]It's over.
[205:25.25]Fine.
[205:25.45]You want to see my face?
[205:26.57]You want to see the face cam reveal?
[205:28.05]Face reveal?
[205:28.77]Is that what you guys want?
[205:30.27]Alright.
[205:31.83]Give me a second.
[205:37.19]Just give me one second.
[205:38.05]Give me one second for the face reveal.
[205:40.70]For the first time ever.
[205:41.76]You want to see my face for the first fucking time?
[205:51.74]Give me a minute.
[205:56.43]I'll be back in two seconds.
