[ve:60.16.100]

[01:11.00]Hey there.
[01:19.00]Oh, you wanted me to say something else.
[01:20.90]Sorry.
[01:21.79]Hi, guys.
[01:22.67]Welcome to Friday.
[01:24.77]If you didn't get a welcome to Friday already, I'm here to do that for you.
[01:28.03]Let me just make a tweet.
[01:31.37]I'll be here in a second.
[01:31.99]We're going to play more Octogeddon.
[01:34.67]Probably finishing the game tonight.
[01:36.74]Unless there's some more content there to play.
[01:40.02]We'll see.
[01:41.30]See you guys in like two minutes.
[01:43.14]We are effing early.
[01:46.04]So give me like a minute or two.
[01:49.25]You know what I'm going to start saying now?
[01:51.57]Ciao.
[01:52.87]Yep.
[01:54.69]I'm going to say ciao when I say bye or I'll be right back.
[01:57.77]Ciao.
[01:57.97]See you in a minute.
[02:50.35]Hey, ciao guys.
[02:51.23]How are you?
[02:54.60]Let's get started.
[02:57.14]Again, more octagon.
[02:59.16]I don't think there's very much left in the game.
[03:01.50]I think there's probably... Well, it depends on how badly I play.
[03:07.16]I could lose catastrophically over and over again as the stream goes on.
[03:13.19]But realistically, there's probably only maybe a couple hours left in this game.
[03:18.59]I would maybe think to myself out loud.
[03:23.26]Might be a little more.
[03:23.84]Maybe there's a couple of challenges I would want to try.
[03:26.12]We're just going to get through the content of this game.
[03:30.88]Because I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[03:32.64]I think it's very good.
[03:34.43]So I'm going to give my... We'll pass final judgment on the game in like a couple hours.
[03:41.87]If this game gets finished way too early, let's say the stream's only like an hour long, uh, we'll just go back to Alpha Protocol.
[03:50.27]So, that's the plan.
[03:51.73]If, if, we're gonna do logic here.
[03:54.25]Ready for some logic statements?
[03:56.13]Okay.
[03:57.15]If Octogeddon, less than one hour, therefore, Alpha Protocol.
[04:04.80]If Octogeddon, more than three hours, therefore, stream ends.
[04:13.60]Those of you guys that do... Come on, that... Who's taking logic here?
[04:23.27]Look, he's not going to say anything bad about the game.
[04:28.85]What do you mean, say something bad about the game?
[04:30.77]I already did.
[04:36.15]You didn't hear... You must not have been here when I talked all this shit.
[04:38.80]Alright, let's get it over here.
[04:43.09]No more horsing around, as my father used to say.
[04:48.19]Hey, quit horsing around.
[04:50.73]That's an old school way to tell somebody to stop.
[04:54.10]Hey, there it is.
[04:57.20]So you know what?
[04:58.16]You kids better stop horsing around in this chat, or I'm going to be very upset about it.
[05:06.02]There's a banned planet on that solar system.
[05:12.92]If you have no idea what's going on, let me be the one to invite you to this wonderful, wonderful experience we have here.
[05:23.05]This is Octogeddon.
[05:24.69]I'm not going to buy anything except one extra tentacle.
[05:29.01]Two, no, one.
[05:31.16]Because I'm very confident in my gamer skill that I'll be able to get through at least this first part.
[05:38.79]So this is a rogue-like, rogue-lite.
[05:44.52]Do I still hate PopCap?
[05:46.94]Oh, this isn't, this is not PopCap.
[05:49.94]This is George Fan.
[05:52.88]Who is OG PopCap.
[06:00.01]He's a rogue-like PopCap.
[06:04.03]Actually, this kind of sucks.
[06:06.39]Yes, we are pretty, we are pretty early right now.
[06:11.26]Do I currently hate PopCap?
[06:13.58]Yes, I do.
[06:17.28]Oh, goddammit.
[06:18.00]I'm supposed to not take any damage and show you guys how good I am.
[06:20.69]To start the rogue-like without getting one point of damage hit on me.
[06:28.85]Looks like Rampage.
[06:29.78]It's kind of like Rampage, but Rampage that decided to do a line of crack.
[06:36.34]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[06:38.86]I probably should have put an upgrade on.
[06:41.48]Look at how good I am.
[06:43.41]Not against these enemies.
[06:47.65]Like I'm so useless against these fucking fish right now.
[06:58.25]Roll right.
[06:59.59]I can't roll right until the building's down.
[07:01.13]I kind of fucked myself in the face because I don't have anything to take care of those stupid piranhas.
[07:12.41]Don't worry.
[07:12.91]Once I get an attachment here, we're going to get all the health back.
[07:15.65]Don't worry.
[07:16.09]Everything's going to be fine.
[07:24.09]Come on.
[07:25.33]Come on.
[07:25.59]I got a warm-up.
[07:26.31]This is the warm-up round.
[07:27.43]I'm gonna lose instantly I'm so I'm in so much trouble.
[07:33.35]I have two of these coming You see how much trouble I'm in right now I Better not die at world one.
[07:44.29]I hope not But I didn't get any if this is gonna hit me.
[07:48.23]It's gonna kill me.
[07:49.97]I Didn't buy any attachments
[07:53.65]I'm gonna die in World 1 because I can't do any damage.
[07:58.73]Well, here's your warm-up.
[08:02.33]Let this be a lesson to you all.
[08:05.07]Never, ever have no attachment.
[08:08.37]Because I'm just gonna restart the whole thing.
[08:11.16]Just restart.
[08:13.00]I'm just gonna kill myself over and over again.
[08:18.36]I can't.
[08:18.70]I have to.
[08:19.60]I have to just lose.
[08:26.43]I put out an extra tentacle and no attachment!
[08:30.06]Just fucking hit me!
[08:30.96]Kill me three more times!
[08:32.78]This is a disaster.
[08:42.09]Go on, kill me.
[08:43.71]Kill me so we can start over.
[08:46.75]No, I didn't want the extra health.
[08:48.15]Just die already.
[08:53.29]Pause button, pause.
[08:54.09]I thought it was gonna be like an escape route for me.
[09:02.79]No, I'm going to die two more times.
[09:06.13]This is the first time I have ever attempted.
[09:08.13]If you were here last stream, we didn't do this.
[09:12.58]I literally just fucked myself for no reason.
[09:20.79]It's alright.
[09:21.71]The stream... We just got to be 7 o'clock.
[09:27.09]It's 7 o'clock right now.
[09:28.81]The stream just started.
[09:34.11]I didn't get this far last stream.
[09:37.65]No, I didn't want to get that!
[09:38.73]Does it use a new game?
[09:42.79]Oh, I don't want to do a new game.
[09:43.89]I have, like, six hours of playtime on this one.
[09:48.21]It's just a question of losing immediately.
[09:57.57]Yeah, I know.
[09:58.75]Watch me die another time.
[09:59.79]I don't think I can exit and be done.
[10:14.54]This is not a joke game!
[10:17.08]Hit the menu button.
[10:21.02]Okay, well... Now, see, new game, right?
[10:24.92]See, continue game.
[10:26.52]I can't do new game.
[10:28.14]If I do new game, I think I might erase my save file.
[10:36.96]Yeah, I think I just have to die here.
[10:40.27]I'm fairly certain if I press that button that I might start a brand new game.
[10:48.41]So, we do have to just run this stuff.
[11:02.29]Cool math games.
[11:04.15]No, no, I'm not giving you a good first impression of this game.
[11:06.87]This game is fucking awesome.
[11:09.73]If you didn't see the stream last night, just hold on a second.
[11:15.04]This is not an indicator of the game.
[11:16.52]This is the indicator of me fucking up.
[11:18.16]I don't have any shells to spend.
[11:21.14]Here we go.
[11:21.80]Let's go.
[11:22.18]Alright, hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[11:31.37]We are literally at the last, like, hour and a half of this game.
[11:35.39]Here we go.
[11:35.73]We got a cobra right off the bat.
[11:36.83]Perfect.
[11:38.73]So let me explain to you guys what's actually going on here.
[11:41.87]So I didn't put any attachments on, and that's why it was a joke.
[11:46.85]So this game is by the guy that made Plants vs. Zombies.
[11:51.76]Right?
[11:52.44]Why am I late?
[11:55.08]We're gonna do Penguin, and we're gonna do Snake and Penguin.
[11:57.46]So the guy that made Plants vs. Zombies made this game.
[12:02.58]Not PopCap, by the way.
[12:05.98]And it's a game where you destroy the entire world as an octopus.
[12:08.74]It's a roguelike, so you're supposed to lose and die and spend these things called shells to upgrade your character permanently to keep going through the levels and eventually destroy the whole world.
[12:17.91]And that dog in the background, by the way, little pro tip, a little dev secret, that dog is eating shit logs.
[12:23.69]If you didn't know, that's an interesting little tidbit there of info.
[12:27.89]See, now I can actually play the game.
[12:29.55]And we get stealthed enemies.
[12:32.07]This is great!
[12:33.27]This is great!
[12:35.27]Oh, this is not good.
[12:37.19]What time is it?
[12:38.27]7.06?
[12:38.39]Alright, let's see when the real stream starts.
[12:43.55]These things called shells.
[12:53.05]You spend money to upgrade your guy over the course of a life or two.
[12:58.02]Get three lives.
[12:58.72]You can buy new lives if you want.
[13:03.26]But, you end up getting kind of insane.
[13:05.00]You get a bunch of tentacles, a bunch of crazy shit happens, and the game is fantastic.
[13:09.56]So, don't let that first five seconds be an indicator of if you should play this game.
[13:13.48]And no, by the way, this is not a sponsored fucking stream.
[13:16.85]We had to reiterate that like a hundred times yesterday.
[13:19.07]I'm gonna give him one.
[13:27.84]There we go.
[13:32.52]His bosses... have got to save for the Black Mamba.
[13:37.69]From here on out, I probably am.
[13:39.59]I don't think I'm going to... Although I do need to do this, because I'm going to get collapsed down here.
[13:45.49]Oh, I'm going to get collapsed down.
[13:51.25]These things are going to die right now.
[13:52.29]Go, go, go, go, go.
[13:52.99]Come on.
[14:02.34]Stream is sponsored.
[14:03.54]Guys, give me a break.
[14:16.17]Alright, here comes a huge wave.
[14:17.15]I think I'm really getting screwed here with these guys.
[14:25.08]Oh, that's not good.
[14:25.84]This is bad.
[14:26.30]Okay, I gotta make this count.
[14:27.68]Oh my lord, this is not good.
[14:28.74]I'm gonna get hit here.
[14:33.66]Yeah, I mean, I'm just gonna... I had to do that.
[14:37.47]Way too many enemies.
[14:39.73]Too many to deal with!
[14:40.77]There we go.
[14:45.80]Let's get through New York one at least.
[14:51.58]Take out these dudes.
[14:52.58]Do not come and collapse on me.
[14:54.30]Not right now.
[14:55.49]I need an angler.
[14:57.25]If you don't know, Angler is one of the attachments you can put on.
[15:00.18]It makes it so you can see shit.
[15:01.92]If they're cloaked, you can see right through them.
[15:05.34]I'm consuming plenty of liquids.
[15:11.93]Once this comes down, the level's over.
[15:13.59]And you get your permanent upgradeable stuff.
[15:16.35]You get shells for destroying these buildings.
[15:19.38]And complete levels.
[15:20.28]See?
[15:24.67]We're up to 20 shells last night.
[15:26.43]I think I capped out like 700 and then you buy stuff to permanently upgrade your character Here we go.
[15:34.66]I Think what I'm gonna do is I'd like to save but I also need a little bit more damage.
[15:38.50]I think I'm like kind of Well, it's cheap maybe I should just do it no B is homing missiles
[15:54.24]Alright, I think I'm gonna put in the title of this stream, this is not a fucking sponsored stream.
[16:01.86]I'm gonna like put it on the screen.
[16:04.72]Like, do I have to put on the screen, holy shit guys, this is not sponsored in bold letters?
[16:10.34]Do I have to do that?
[16:12.36]Don't make me do that shit.
[16:16.13]I'm gonna like have to do that.
[16:26.53]Yeah, because at that point, then it is.
[16:29.05]Oh, my God.
[16:31.33]Can't I just play a fucking video game and enjoy it?
[16:34.17]Am I not allowed to do that anymore?
[16:37.33]What happened?
[16:37.89]Last night, everybody was so on board with this.
[16:40.13]And now, all of a sudden, one day later, this is like a joke mobile sellout game?
[16:44.64]What happened in 24 hours?
[16:48.64]What the fuck happened?
[16:55.42]I don't remember this yesterday.
[16:56.51]This didn't happen yesterday.
[17:11.11]This is confusing me.
[17:14.90]Everyone got their brain wiped.
[17:18.16]Let's go with... Let's get another tentacle.
[17:24.36]and a bee now I'm gonna save the mouse is off center yeah I know oh I know trust me yelling at chat is against terms of service oh didn't they do like a bunch of terms of service stuff I didn't even read it
[17:54.13]Should I read that?
[17:55.03]Is there anything I need to know about the Terms of Service?
[17:57.83]Alright, we got a chest spawning here.
[18:16.36]I mean, you may need to read it.
[18:18.30]Ah, just getting by, who cares?
[18:20.96]Give me the money, give me the money!
[18:33.14]It's pronounced T-O-S.
[18:33.98]No, it's the Terms of Service.
[18:39.52]They made a whole South Park episode on Terms of Service.
[18:42.40]Nobody reads it.
[18:48.34]I think I'm going to be just fine.
[18:49.42]The range on the weapons are not good.
[18:58.38]Well, some of them are.
[19:00.76]So this cobra, for instance, it only shoots a certain distance, whereas the bee, as you see, shoots very far.
[19:05.36]It's also homing.
[19:07.08]So that helps, too.
[19:09.30]You don't know.
[19:15.57]Let's just get through New York without any deaths.
[19:20.39]That would be sweet as candy.
[19:22.87]You know what I'm saying?
[19:26.11]That would be sweet as candy.
[19:38.19]Why do I never- Oh, uh, no, we're not gonna talk about that yet.
[19:46.39]There's something I want to talk about.
[19:47.41]We'll talk about that on Tuesday.
[19:50.07]For Light Gun Extravaganza.
[19:54.23]While Jeremy tries to find an old CRTV- CRT TV that will work.
[19:59.81]Because you can't play these old PlayStation 1 games with Light Gun unless you got an old-ass fuckin' TV that's a dope tube TV.
[20:07.75]Don't worry, I'm gonna get it figured out.
[20:09.87]I got it situated.
[20:10.61]I got a lot of equipment.
[20:12.33]I got all kinds of equipment.
[20:14.75]We're gonna lock it down.
[20:25.41]Shit.
[20:27.10]I'll send you mine.
[20:27.88]What's my address?
[20:29.08]My address is 4441 Bugleberry Drive.
[20:37.54]And that is in, uh, that is in, uh, Swiss-Conson.
[20:42.23]Swiss-Conson, Rhode Island.
[20:50.37]Uh, yeah, that's... Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get that last little french fry.
[21:01.06]Good!
[21:04.01]See, this game's fucking fun.
[21:05.25]It's a fun game and you should all respect my opinions.
[21:08.54]Respect my opinions.
[21:14.28]I deserve to be respected.
[21:24.30]No, we're not gonna do this again.
[21:25.84]The fries queue up.
[21:26.96]I know that McDonald's french fries, they put a bunch of fucking fry poison in a rat.
[21:31.96]And he got like more hair.
[21:34.64]Everybody was yelling at me yesterday about, do we have like, hold on, I got, alright, calm down, Jeremy.
[21:40.23]Do we, does Chad have like a mind wipe device?
[21:49.47]Alright, let me, can I ask you guys, were any of you here yesterday?
[21:53.02]Any of you?
[21:54.42]I mean like one person.
[22:03.78]Yes.
[22:04.32]No.
[22:04.90]No.
[22:05.26]Yes.
[22:05.74]No.
[22:11.26]Oh, you guys have to back me up.
[22:14.52]Nobody was here.
[22:15.78]I feel like I'm having deja vu.
[22:22.02]What?
[22:22.34]Why is... I'm having deja... Wait, we gotta snuffle up against... No, no, no.
[22:25.04]I don't want that.
[22:27.59]I need some melee damage here.
[22:34.48]You streamed yesterday?
[22:35.66]You guys are freaking me out.
[22:48.01]Called Jerma out on his view bots.
[22:50.47]I don't even know what that... Fucking view bots.
[22:59.15]God.
[22:59.81]Thank God they killed that.
[23:04.49]Or did they?
[23:05.38]Who knows?
[23:09.92]Can we go over this for a second?
[23:11.84]I never understood that, by the way.
[23:13.60]It's like view bots, right?
[23:15.74]So if somebody was streaming to like 500 fake people, don't you know that you're not talking to anybody?
[23:23.61]Think about that.
[23:25.01]Like, if I just had a stream going and I was doing this just to nobody.
[23:29.29]I was just sitting here in my house just talking to nothing.
[23:34.45]Just to 500 separate IP addresses.
[23:41.71]I feel like that's, like, wasted time.
[23:47.41]You're not doing that enough.
[23:51.65]What did you... What the fuck, man?
[23:55.63]No, I don't... Why would I ever do that?
[24:02.56]Fucking view bots.
[24:04.82]I'm like offended that those even exist in the first place.
[24:08.22]You should be offended by them.
[24:12.88]Oh god, it's gonna be a long one tonight.
[24:30.66]What's my favorite color?
[24:31.74]I don't know.
[24:32.84]Green?
[24:37.87]The angler looking like not winning that big of a deal to not have it.
[24:45.95]Can I explain this game a little bit here for people that have no idea what's going on and everyone that came in and just started screaming at me?
[24:54.42]Look, you don't have to be so loud.
[24:55.96]You're yelling at me, right?
[24:58.74]Let's talk about what this game is, for real, now that enough people have trickled in here.
[25:06.33]Did you like Plants vs. Zombies?
[25:08.21]Did you?
[25:09.13]It's a yes or no question.
[25:10.99]That's it.
[25:11.75]Just answer the question.
[25:13.53]Answer the goddamn question!
[25:19.20]Huh?
[25:20.76]Alright, for everybody that says yes...
[25:23.36]This is made by the same guy that made Plants vs. Zombies.
[25:27.74]Will you stop yelling at me?
[25:33.20]You're screaming at me.
[25:34.76]I don't like to be screamed at.
[25:35.91]Move in here.
[25:51.83]You can't stop yelling, it's on autopilot.
[26:03.86]Why do I keep bringing that up?
[26:07.46]I don't know, because a shitload of people came into the stream and think this is some random cereal box game.
[26:31.26]No, I gotta move, I gotta move.
[26:36.57]Don't wanna get hit by these guys.
[26:37.81]No thank you.
[26:39.85]No thanks.
[26:46.19]This is the sequel to Arms.
[26:53.91]He'll go down now.
[27:00.12]What is this yippity-nippity game?
[27:04.86]Die!
[27:05.42]Okay.
[27:16.33]See, this is why I feel like I have a virtual reality headset where I'm watching my stream from yesterday that I never did, apparently.
[27:27.98]The general sentiment yesterday was this was a great game.
[27:31.28]And now all of a sudden, like, we put on our cereal box Virtual Boy headset and rewind, and now all of a sudden nobody likes this game?
[27:36.75]What happened?
[27:37.75]What is going on here?
[27:51.22]Why are we rewriting history right now?
[28:07.74]Did you see this funny character?
[28:09.68]Look at this funny character.
[28:10.68]This is not a good game because it's not a popular game.
[28:23.59]This game is fun.
[28:24.71]I like this game, okay?
[28:27.07]So let me tell you something.
[28:29.52]We are living in a dictatorship here.
[28:33.55]I get to choose what game I play.
[28:35.77]I get to decide what's on this stream.
[28:37.67]And I get to give your fate.
[28:42.65]No, no, don't click that box.
[28:44.23]Don't click the X. Wait a minute.
[28:45.79]No, I promise I'll play Overwatch.
[28:47.87]I'll play PUBG.
[28:49.17]Just don't leave.
[28:50.15]I'll play PUBG in like an hour.
[28:52.79]Just don't click that box.
[28:57.30]I swear to God, I'll open up a Hearthstone card pack!
[29:00.02]I promise!
[29:04.05]Shit, I got Ragnaros!
[29:05.45]I got Ragnaros and that card back for the tenth time!
[29:09.01]Oh shit, don't get hit.
[29:27.65]Streamer kicks everybody and streams to no one.
[29:33.75]Holy shit, guys.
[29:35.15]I think I might have gotten another... Hold on, I gotta pay attention.
[29:46.18]Alright, now I can make the dumb reference.
[29:54.87]Great opening streams.
[29:57.05]God damn it.
[29:58.06]I don't even know what to say.
[30:02.64]Alright, let's get two Cobras.
[30:10.34]I want to put this... We'll put it in between the bee.
[30:16.87]And get us another Cobra.
[30:17.97]I want more damage.
[30:18.85]I need more DPS.
[30:21.17]I could use an Angler, but who cares?
[30:22.69]We might not even get it.
[30:30.94]So if you're curious what the hell these are, what's going on here, I feel like everybody here was not here yesterday.
[30:36.96]So let's go over something so people understand what the fuck is happening.
[30:40.37]So as I've been playing through the game, we're near the end of the game.
[30:44.45]We almost beat the game last night.
[30:46.35]So every time I completed a new world, or I did some kind of achievement, I unlocked another arm.
[30:53.17]DNA.
[30:54.74]that lets me put this onto anywhere I want.
[30:58.14]You cannot remove them, you cannot sell them, you can only replace them.
[31:00.84]They all do different things.
[31:02.38]There's dozens and dozens and dozens of them in the game.
[31:05.25]And you kind of roll which one you're gonna be able to put on.
[31:10.97]He's gonna explain it again like he was paid for it.
[31:18.21]I'm gonna have a fucking mental breakdown on stream tonight.
[31:28.05]You want to open up Van Cleef?
[31:30.43]You want to open up Van Cleef?
[31:31.63]I'll do it.
[31:31.97]I will go open Hearthstone card packs until I get Edward Van Cleef.
[31:37.92]Is that what you want to watch?
[31:39.62]I'll do it.
[31:42.30]And then I will delete my Blizzard account.
[31:56.08]That's gonna actually be like a lot of money.
[32:00.94]Shit.
[32:03.94]That's like, that's potentially like thousands of dollars to do that.
[32:14.55]Streamers paid to have mental breakdown on stream.
[32:20.57]Imagine if I sat there for like 10 grand and I didn't get Edward Van Cleef.
[32:25.80]I would just quit streaming.
[32:28.53]You would see the end of the channel at that point.
[32:40.60]God damn it, I didn't even see him.
[32:51.98]Alright, as a King Cobra, that's a little bit rarer.
[32:55.86]Hey, it's a rare thing to get.
[32:57.56]That's a rare card.
[33:01.62]Save the money.
[33:07.88]Explain the DNA again.
[33:12.22]Fuck it.
[33:13.64]Fuck it.
[33:14.90]Fuck it.
[33:20.34]Ay, ay, ay.
[33:29.70]I'm gonna beat this game on stream.
[33:32.67]It's gonna happen.
[33:33.95]Whether you like it or not.
[33:35.03]I don't even know what hit me.
[33:36.33]I'm, like, so... I'm so, like, upset at this moment.
[33:39.45]That, like, I don't even... I gotta, like, get back into playing, like, one of my favorite games.
[33:49.40]Nobody's gonna stop me.
[34:14.01]Watch out for the exploding people.
[34:20.57]Alright, we're good.
[34:24.19]I have to pay attention to this because I don't want to die here.
[34:29.87]I'm getting attacked at all angles.
[34:40.76]Both physically and metaphorically.
[34:54.83]Alright, that's good.
[34:56.43]I actually will replace this.
[34:57.43]This is just an upgraded version of the DNA.
[34:59.15]I'm gonna save the rest of the money.
[35:03.41]Wait, hold on.
[35:04.92]We haven't used this yet.
[35:08.12]I kind of want to use this here.
[35:11.14]Let's replace the penguin.
[35:13.98]This is like a shotgun, I guess.
[35:15.70]We have not seen it yet.
[35:19.18]Only elephants.
[35:20.38]I don't want to do... All the elephant does is pushes things away.
[35:27.25]There is no saving the game.
[35:29.21]And the game saves automatically.
[35:31.63]Over the course of the next, you know... Every time you complete... Every time you die, you go back and upgrade and, you know, etc, etc.
[35:41.76]This thing's actually really good.
[35:42.68]If I had more of these... Alright, remind me if I see a porcupine to just do, like, porcupines all over me.
[36:02.13]Hold on, now wait, now you guys are doing like the raffle joke?
[36:07.83]Who gave my chat catnip over the last 12 hours?
[36:12.86]I wanna know who they were.
[36:14.66]You don't ever give chat catnip.
[36:16.68]They lose their fucking minds.
[36:26.61]Why is this happening?
[36:39.36]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[36:41.02]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[36:45.64]Alright, now we're in emote only mode.
[36:52.97]Is this because I said this shit about Legend of Zelda?
[36:55.27]Is this why I'm being treated like this?
[36:57.75]Is it because I said Zelda sucks?
[36:59.45]Is this why?
[37:00.11]Is this your way of saying thank you to me?
[37:05.31]Is this your way of causing your revenge?
[37:11.32]Oh shit, now the people that weren't here yesterday won't know that that's a joke too.
[37:15.20]God damn it.
[37:18.18]But can I just please play my fun game that I really like?
[37:21.27]And I won't talk about how Ocarina of Time was the only good one, and all the other ones were shitty, cheap imitations of it.
[37:28.79]No, that's a joke too, but you probably don't know that.
[37:30.69]But just listen.
[37:32.55]Just keep it in emote only mode, don't let them out yet.
[37:34.93]Because they're going to be really mad about that.
[37:47.11]Oh, I got a frog.
[37:47.73]No, save the money.
[37:50.91]What?
[37:51.07]You were supposed to let him out!
[37:52.31]You were supposed to keep him there!
[38:08.44]Save the money.
[38:14.30]It's to avenge the idiot scientists.
[38:19.70]Who's having a good time tonight?
[38:25.14]Hurley in Australia.
[38:26.24]That was a bad accent.
[38:28.64]Look, I can't even do my accents tonight.
[38:31.06]You guys have cut me off.
[38:32.52]You guys have like got me off tonight.
[38:36.69]With your incredibly, incredibly disrespectful behavior.
[38:43.27]It's totally disrespectful and against everything I stand for.
[38:50.58]Wait a minute.
[38:51.08]Oh, excuse me.
[38:52.18]Excuse me!
[38:53.98]Did you guys see the new Terms of Service?
[38:55.68]Fucking god damn it.
[38:57.92]I got hit by something so dumb.
[39:02.02]I think in that new Terms of Service, it says, hey, what the fuck, dude?
[39:06.61]Somewhere in there, it says that.
[39:13.63]Revel against this tyrant.
[39:20.58]I really don't want to lose any unnecessary lives, because the last level, the last, like, five levels are, like, so difficult.
[39:25.78]I can't just be fucking around here.
[39:37.37]I do like Shotgun Porcupine, though.
[39:38.75]He's really good.
[39:42.09]I recommend the Shotgun Porcupine in your playthrough.
[39:55.85]Keep letting the cat in and out.
[39:58.09]What happened?
[40:02.49]I let your cat out?
[40:04.87]I missed that.
[40:11.24]Wow!
[40:11.98]No!
[40:12.58]Shit!
[40:12.88]I'm gonna lose here.
[40:15.48]No, I'm not.
[40:18.46]Too many of those dumb androids.
[40:32.27]Please break this before I lose.
[40:33.56]Thank you.
[40:38.62]Thank you.
[40:40.14]More shells.
[40:51.03]I love how everybody has such a good time in this chat.
[40:56.91]Regardless of the situation, everybody has such a great time.
[41:00.66]It makes me happy.
[41:07.72]Supposed to be saving money, but it's kind of dire.
[41:14.48]Uh, no chicken.
[41:15.59]The chicken shoots like an explosive egg.
[41:18.17]But, this'll do us well for a little while.
[41:21.01]There's another porcupine, though, I'm gonna put it on.
[41:22.79]I'm gonna replace one of the, probably the bee.
[41:30.61]We will change.
[41:33.39]Does a lot of damage, too.
[41:34.47]Well, it's $1,300, so it better be good.
[41:37.21]There we go.
[41:50.71]Watch the left side.
[41:57.98]Perfect.
[41:59.02]Perfect execution.
[42:01.26]Perfect execution on that fucking wanker.
[42:12.79]Somebody gifted you a subscription.
[42:14.22]Well, thank that person.
[42:15.40]Nice.
[42:17.06]I have not got to try the Black Bomba yet.
[42:20.70]Every time I say I want to save, I end up needing to use it because I'm going to lose.
[42:33.04]My cursor is over Sydney, too.
[42:34.80]Yeah, that was an issue we were having last time, too.
[42:38.74]I gotta move.
[42:39.28]This is not good.
[42:41.88]That guy up there needs to die.
[42:45.24]Always that stupid drone thing that comes in and kills me.
[42:49.19]Of all things.
[42:52.99]Of all things.
[42:57.79]There we go.
[42:59.99]Fairly clean.
[43:01.79]Wait!
[43:08.03]Say that now and I'm about to get fucking overwhelmed.
[43:09.77]That's fine.
[43:10.45]We're good.
[43:12.67]It's only harder from here on out.
[43:15.37]No hand holding.
[43:24.10]Hey kid, wanna buy some illegal memes?
[43:28.98]You don't think that there's a governmental crackdown force on illegal memes?
[43:33.40]That I pay tons of money to make sure it stays there?
[43:40.18]I have a crackdown governmental crackdown force ready to come after you you'll always know it's different I've paid I have about 600 vehicles that are all obviously stationed in subcontracted under local departments but you can always tell because the car it's not it's a separate police car
[44:09.49]Like, I don't care if you... You could be smoking crack in your car, and they don't give a shit.
[44:14.91]If you're saying an illegal meme, though, you're gonna get pulled over.
[44:17.77]They'll pull you over, they'll check your phone, they'll check your browser history to see the things you've been saying in chat rooms and stuff.
[44:24.81]You could have, like, a pound of crack in your trunk.
[44:27.63]Or, literally, you could be smoking crack in front of the meme officer, and it's not his jurisdiction.
[44:36.95]I'm gonna save, though.
[44:40.06]I don't think any of these will do anything for me now.
[44:42.54]I could do a second super lobster, but no, this is fine.
[44:58.25]Streamer encourages smoking crack in front of police officers.
[45:02.09]No, I did not.
[45:03.37]I just said that's not the jurisdiction of the meme police.
[45:09.07]Did you ever see that in every TV show and movie that has the guy that does something really wrong or bad or he stole a bunch of money and he goes to the Mexican border and he steps over the line and the police officer is on the other line in the United States and they're like, I respect you, man.
[45:27.38]Can't do anything to you, but good luck.
[45:29.86]And that's what happens.
[45:30.88]Okay, hold on, I gotta pay attention.
[45:36.44]There's no jurisdictions.
[45:46.36]That happens in, like, Fast and the Furious 3!
[45:49.92]There's one guy standing at the border, and one guy standing at the United States border, and they're talking across the border to each other, like, five feet away.
[45:56.51]And they have a respectful goodbye, because the, uh, the rock can't do anything.
[46:02.35]No, wait, what movie am I thinking of?
[46:05.73]No, that was, that was, like, Fast and the Furious 7.
[46:08.77]What movie was that?
[46:10.24]What Fast and the Furious did they do the Mexican border thing that they do in every movie?
[46:19.23]Does that happen in Breaking Bad?
[46:22.21]I don't know, what movie does that happen in?
[46:28.03]Oh shit, oh shit, OH SHIT!
[46:29.37]Okay, I have to shut up here.
[46:32.29]Alright, no more Breaking Bad jokes.
[46:35.10]I don't wanna lose.
[46:43.00]Straight up, that's fine.
[46:44.12]The porcupine is so good here though.
[46:46.12]For real.
[46:50.09]Has just infinite range.
[46:55.23]He's gonna go straight up and straight down.
[46:57.00]Yep, he is.
[46:57.88]Now where are you going?
[47:03.82]Woo!
[47:07.28]Oh, fuck.
[47:08.00]Okay, I'm fine.
[47:09.81]What did the little kangaroos come out?
[47:15.48]I don't like where you're going with this.
[47:16.46]I don't like where you're going with that one.
[47:17.50]Why is that one going over here?
[47:19.08]Oh my lord in heaven, I'm gonna lose.
[47:21.01]Holy fuck.
[47:24.85]That was so close.
[47:25.83]That was too close.
[47:35.19]Oh!
[47:35.69]I'm fine.
[47:40.84]Oh my god, my mom!
[47:43.86]C'mon!
[47:47.01]I don't know why I always say mom or anything.
[47:48.79]It's just a knee-jerk reaction, guys.
[47:50.71]I mean, this is technically a mom, right?
[48:08.27]And here comes the death in three, four, five, four...
[48:13.74]Three.
[48:14.98]Two.
[48:16.20]Three.
[48:17.22]Four.
[48:18.18]Five.
[48:19.32]Four.
[48:20.40]Three.
[48:21.54]Two.
[48:22.75]One.
[48:24.33]Two.
[48:25.41]One.
[48:26.79]Destruction!
[48:33.95]That wasn't a count- No, I was counting down, not counting up.
[48:39.42]Don't fuck this up.
[48:40.54]I could really mess this up right now.
[48:44.14]I need to pay attention, the most I've ever paid attention to ever in a video game, right now.
[48:50.53]I just, I thought I just got hit, and I just got so scared.
[49:02.88]We'll get an emote only mode again.
[49:04.58]Why are you guys misbehaving so much tonight?
[49:10.46]What's with the misbehavior?
[49:17.05]Counting down is illegal.
[49:18.05]No, it's not.
[49:18.83]Counting up.
[49:19.51]Ah, wait.
[49:19.99]No.
[49:20.23]Wait a minute.
[49:20.77]No, no, no.
[49:21.13]Counting is illegal.
[49:24.17]But don't you know?
[49:24.67]If... What movie is that from?
[49:29.85]Where the guy's... The actor is playing a character.
[49:33.21]He's playing the president and he's like... No, no, no.
[49:36.12]It's... Richard Nixon.
[49:38.90]If the president does something, it's not illegal.
[49:41.22]That's when Frost V. Nixon won the Academy Award for greatest movie of all time.
[49:46.76]See?
[49:48.18]I know my movies.
[49:48.90]Yeah, like Nixon was standing in the border of Mexico and he just like had a bunch of drugs and shit and he drove across the border and like the rock confronts him and he's like, that was illegal!
[49:58.69]And Richard Nixon then goes, if the president does something, it's not illegal.
[50:02.73]And then the rock like nods and they turn around and go separate ways and then Richard Nixon lives all the rest of his life in Mexico.
[50:09.98]He's like a drug lord.
[50:30.22]Oh, wait, hold on.
[50:31.08]Didn't Twitch add, like, pineapple pizza?
[50:34.26]Let's see the pizza emotes.
[50:35.35]Why not?
[50:35.77]You only have, like, another six hours to use them.
[50:41.83]By the way, we keep on getting screwed here.
[50:43.61]I want better stuff.
[50:45.19]Yeah, there's, like, pepperoni pizza and, like, pineapple pizza.
[50:49.37]Let's go.
[50:49.79]Cool.
[50:51.17]Best pizza.
[50:53.96]By the way, can we, like, can we just address this for a second here?
[50:58.27]That's very, very, very... That's a very subjective opinion to say that that's the best pizza.
[51:05.19]Maybe that's like that person's best pizza, but is that actually the best pizza?
[51:09.51]There's so many different pizza types.
[51:11.79]But how can you say that that's the best pizza?
[51:17.07]Because it isn't, at all.
[51:18.03]I mean, like pineapple on pizza is like, wow, you should go to jail if you put it on.
[51:25.08]Like straight up prison, they should arrest you.
[51:28.37]if you decide to do that.
[51:34.95]You need to go straight to jail.
[51:39.23]By the way, I am fucked here because I don't have an angler.
[51:43.17]Is there an angler?
[51:43.89]Thank you for the angler.
[51:45.57]Appreciate it.
[51:47.33]Let's replace the bee.
[51:50.33]But there's a porcupine too.
[51:51.59]Okay, hold on.
[51:52.89]New strategy.
[51:55.15]We're gonna replace B. And I'm gonna do a double porcupine.
[52:00.69]Sounds good to me.
[52:05.23]There we go.
[52:10.08]Uh, no, to be completely honest with you... Pineapple pizza?
[52:15.98]Whatever.
[52:16.28]I don't understand why people, like, have... You know, are so, like, insane over it.
[52:23.54]It's okay.
[52:24.18]It's good.
[52:26.95]I would rather... You know, I'm more of a... Hold on, I have to pay attention.
[52:37.17]I would say I'm more of a pepperoni guy.
[52:41.49]Depending on the scenario.
[52:54.70]But, like, just eat whatever pizza you want.
[52:56.95]Don't tell anybody that your pizza is the better pizza.
[53:01.27]Because that... You can't just say that.
[53:04.73]Pepperoni pizza is god pizza.
[53:13.06]It is.
[53:14.14]But that's my... Like, I think that...
[53:22.96]This is a pretty good combo so far.
[53:27.34]My pizza is the better pizza.
[53:33.30]These things have such huge range.
[53:34.58]It's a crime to not have these.
[53:40.22]Oh, come on.
[53:41.08]Really?
[53:43.05]What a crime.
[53:45.09]Come on!
[53:45.77]What the fuck hit it?
[53:47.49]What the fuck?
[53:51.57]Why did I just turn into, uh... What was that, like, 1998 meme with the little kid that's like, Shut your fuck up!
[54:02.16]You asshole!
[54:03.58]Who remembers that?
[54:04.28]Here we go, King Cobra.
[54:05.56]Replace!
[54:10.74]That's a YouTube voice?
[54:16.21]I want the...
[54:17.85]Big, uh... What's it called?
[54:19.87]Big Mama?
[54:21.13]Big Mamba?
[54:29.64]That's an ancient meme.
[54:32.66]Alright, so as you can see, the King Cobra shoots very, very fast.
[54:43.03]Which we are going to pay attention to him and him only.
[54:47.10]and let the other guys do the work.
[55:02.96]No, don't!
[55:04.88]Okay, that was close.
[55:15.68]I'm fine.
[55:16.38]Everything's fine.
[55:17.10]Don't worry.
[55:18.60]We've got it under control.
[55:21.43]I've got my... I've got my Mamba here.
[55:27.38]I got my monstrous Mamba.
[55:41.11]See how effective this is.
[55:42.95]And why it's absolutely necessary to not get hit in the head by that.
[55:46.55]Because those bullets you have to dodge, you have to go under your chin.
[55:49.97]Or you... Under the chin.
[55:53.28]There we go.
[55:54.54]Here comes our huge wave.
[55:56.86]The monstrous Mamba.
[56:01.28]We got monstrous Mamba.
[56:02.50]Big Mamba.
[56:04.10]Huge Mamba.
[56:10.51]Oh, shit.
[56:11.71]Getting hairy.
[56:15.91]Get rid of him, please.
[56:17.59]Ow!
[56:21.65]We're good.
[56:29.27]Wait, somebody raided the channel?
[56:30.63]What happened?
[56:34.59]Wait, this just said if this raid is offensive.
[56:36.93]Like, what do you mean this raid is offensive?
[56:42.88]Oh, thank you, Amadeus.
[56:45.34]Amadeus Fink, for your raid.
[56:48.11]Hi.
[56:49.71]I think this popped up on my Twitch.
[56:50.95]It was like, hey, if you're offended by this raid... This raid offended me.
[56:57.71]I'm upset by this raid.
[57:03.33]20 people that already left.
[57:04.41]Oh, we got some coral.
[57:08.86]This is blocking two hits.
[57:10.40]I think I want that.
[57:12.90]And I can get a sea otter.
[57:15.10]Good.
[57:18.48]I'm gonna buy a tentacle next.
[57:29.41]So now if I press both left and right mouse button, I'm able to do some pretty cool shit.
[57:36.99]This urchin will shoot in every single direction, but that's not gonna stop that.
[57:44.71]I really do need another tentacle.
[57:46.65]It's gonna cause problems.
[57:47.67]I need another one!
[57:57.84]Jesus.
[57:58.52]Okay, that was kind of annoying.
[58:00.96]We're good.
[58:07.90]Ayayay, just do it.
[58:09.31]I need to do it now.
[58:15.80]Well, she's great.
[58:20.58]Here comes a large enemy.
[58:21.64]This is the mini-boss of this area.
[58:23.18]It's kind of miraculous that I didn't get hit there.
[58:33.63]Easy.
[58:37.21]Easy.
[58:37.93]She's shooting more of them.
[58:38.95]I think the game is making itself harder every time I play it.
[58:43.07]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[58:48.99]This is one of those games.
[58:51.81]Where you have to die over and over again.
[58:58.60]Have to go under the chin.
[59:01.50]The only safe zone.
[59:04.42]Anywhere else.
[59:06.18]And you're fucked.
[59:11.30]What just... Ah!
[59:13.42]I was looking... Why was I paying attention to this guy over here on the right?
[59:16.55]Why?
[59:18.24]I didn't need to see him off.
[59:19.68]He was already gone.
[59:20.50]Why was I staring at him?
[59:21.72]I was just locked into staring at him What is what am I staring at?
[59:26.34]Stop staring at it.
[59:28.52]Oh my god, don't stare at anything Oh fuck fuck Alright, I gotta get her to you now
[59:49.36]Here comes another one.
[59:50.38]Pay attention.
[59:51.04]Oh, shit.
[60:00.71]Jesus!
[60:02.27]Please, Claw.
[60:03.03]I can't move.
[60:03.65]Thank you, Claw.
[60:09.61]Okay, I'm fine.
[60:10.29]Jesus.
[60:10.45]I hate this thing.
[60:13.86]Blind fish chicken.
[60:17.68]Is there any way for me to fix the screen?
[60:19.18]There is no way for me to fix the mouse, unfortunately.
[60:22.24]But all you need to know is left and right mouse button are the only things you press.
[60:26.76]If I hold down left mouse button, I spin to the left.
[60:28.96]If I hold down right mouse button, I spin to the right.
[60:31.44]The mouse doesn't actually do anything.
[60:32.64]It's just on the screen.
[60:38.02]Let's get another tentacle and... I want to put this in between these two.
[60:45.27]And just for the sake of having something there that's not useless, let's just put a crab claw on it.
[60:58.99]What do the DNA do?
[60:59.91]It's essentially unlocking new abilities for your character.
[61:04.71]Did somebody just say that just to make me do the thing again?
[61:12.37]How much do I love this game?
[61:13.39]I really like this game.
[61:15.15]I really do.
[61:15.77]I hope you're understanding why.
[61:20.95]I like that.
[61:30.46]Porcupines on either side helps out.
[61:32.14]It doesn't matter what side I'm on.
[61:33.70]I'm gonna hit something.
[61:37.66]Love is an illusion.
[61:41.11]What is this, the Matrix?
[61:47.73]Not good.
[61:52.34]Had to do that.
[61:53.62]She'll recharge in time, don't worry.
[62:00.21]Die.
[62:00.99]Die!
[62:04.67]Clamp him.
[62:05.05]Let's go.
[62:09.53]Just in time to run right into more of this shit.
[62:18.37]Hey.
[62:23.61]Everything's fine.
[62:26.72]Oh!
[62:27.36]Wow, why did I let it get that far?
[62:29.54]Why did I let that happen?
[62:31.52]I've watched that in slow motion happen to me.
[62:48.80]Flask.
[62:49.42]Got it.
[62:51.78]Guy on the right.
[62:52.60]Don't let... No, he's got... My other right.
[62:59.01]Do it again.
[62:59.89]Come on, save me here.
[63:03.41]Good save.
[63:05.63]That's well worth the money.
[63:06.97]That's well worth the investment, for sure.
[63:08.77]Even if I get a... If a Black Mamba ends up showing up and I don't get it, it doesn't matter.
[63:13.38]The Urchin has saved me from at least four or five points of damage.
[63:17.81]And that is an absolute guarantee.
[63:27.73]Okay, hold it here.
[63:29.01]Now it gives a huge wave right after a huge wave.
[63:33.36]That's not... Oh, this is bad.
[63:35.04]Alright, hold on.
[63:35.76]Quiet.
[63:36.44]Quiet, Jeremy.
[63:38.62]I don't even know.
[63:39.30]I think it was the tank.
[63:40.22]Of course it was.
[63:41.72]Tank's gotta go.
[63:42.44]Now.
[63:43.08]Now!
[63:59.08]God damn it, I can't move over there.
[64:03.16]No, go.
[64:03.82]Please.
[64:11.54]Alright, just snake across.
[64:14.65]You'll be good.
[64:19.75]I'm feeling a game completion here.
[64:22.57]There's two more levels to do.
[64:24.75]I think we're going to do it.
[64:28.63]Bingo.
[64:50.22]Somebody's looking for me to get real upset.
[64:54.78]How does DNA work?
[64:57.26]I'm not even gonna tell you.
[65:05.38]Fucking god damn it.
[65:07.28]I can't win.
[65:08.74]I can't win in this situation.
[65:11.48]The only play is not to play at all.
[65:14.68]I'm not talking about the game.
[65:16.96]You know they say the best offense is a good defense?
[65:19.33]No, it ain't.
[65:21.45]The best offense is pure offense.
[65:36.33]You know, I really think the best offense is a good defense.
[65:38.67]Oh, really?
[65:40.90]So, when, like... When I... So, if you have, like, a really nice, like... Okay, I need to... I just ran into that for no reason.
[65:51.60]I was gonna make a joke about, like, if I... If somebody burnt my house down, like, it doesn't matter how defensive I'm playing in my house.
[65:58.23]My house is on fire, and it just murders me.
[66:06.71]The best offense is you just get a hammer and sprint.
[66:10.47]That's pretty good offense.
[66:13.23]You don't play defense, just grab a hammer and sprint!
[66:21.67]Your house murders you, yes.
[66:23.05]I need to get that to explode.
[66:32.61]And make a chain reaction.
[66:33.81]Perfect.
[66:40.02]Oh, you can do both, right?
[66:41.40]You're gonna have, like, a sword and a shield.
[66:45.22]Make sure that shield has an enchantment on it.
[66:46.60]Otherwise it's gonna be useless.
[66:59.72]Don't zap me, thank you.
[67:11.91]What does this competition have to do with anything?
[67:18.64]Bad move.
[67:19.36]Okay, I'm fine.
[67:21.02]We're good!
[67:23.89]Take a plank.
[67:25.41]Awesome!
[67:31.27]Don't get hit by the nuke.
[67:39.84]Fire bad.
[67:43.55]I'm gonna use this here.
[67:44.23]I feel like it's quite necessary.
[67:50.15]Oh no.
[67:51.17]Nuke.
[67:59.18]As long as I have two or three lives going into the last stage, I think I'm gonna be alright.
[68:03.16]Nuclear wave.
[68:10.67]Not gonna matter if the building goes down.
[68:19.03]Seems socially irresponsible to roll nukes down the street.
[68:23.98]I mean, kind of.
[68:27.06]Hmm.
[68:29.62]Okay, do I... save, or do I buy another King Cobra and replace the claw?
[68:43.27]You guys are dicks.
[68:50.72]No, I want to do... I want some more direct damage.
[69:02.33]Every time.
[69:03.47]No.
[69:03.91]No.
[69:04.35]No!
[69:05.91]No!
[69:13.79]Is this the boss stage?
[69:21.33]Well, it's more useful than the claw.
[69:23.84]At least the baby claw.
[69:25.84]I think there's actually a third tier claw.
[69:29.50]But I don't have it.
[69:34.46]Nah, I wasn't... Should've just used it.
[69:37.56]I wasn't looking over on the right side of the screen.
[69:39.14]Just use it.
[69:39.66]Use it now.
[69:42.15]It's just getting too dangerous.
[69:43.25]I have to pee already.
[69:51.03]It's only been like an hour.
[69:53.09]Am I really gonna pee my pants on stream?
[69:57.04]What's the updated Terms of Service say if you like pee your pants?
[70:01.72]Can I pee my pants on stream?
[70:03.28]What if it's involuntary?
[70:05.60]Am I still getting in trouble?
[70:15.73]Oh my god, there's so many nukes here.
[70:16.82]I just need one to blow up.
[70:19.20]There we go.
[70:19.88]Take it all with you.
[70:20.46]Alright, last one.
[70:24.26]Alright, good.
[70:28.42]Here comes the Stompatron.
[70:29.34]This would be really easy with the porcupines.
[70:31.37]At least I say that now, but don't get cocky.
[70:35.43]Don't be a cocky little freak.
[70:38.75]I'm gonna wait to the next cycle.
[70:43.31]If you pee your pants, that's fine.
[70:45.25]Alright, I'm like... Alright, we're going in on this next one.
[70:54.28]Arms up!
[70:56.84]Alright.
[70:59.98]I guess it's better to have the claw in there.
[71:02.98]But, we'll take what we can get.
[71:06.58]Had a chance.
[71:13.77]There was a shot.
[71:14.63]I didn't take it.
[71:15.33]I'm not going in there either because I'm not taking any unnecessary damage.
[71:23.49]I really have to pee really bad.
[71:27.40]This sucks.
[71:28.34]I hate this feeling.
[71:35.58]Got it.
[71:35.80]That's what I wanted.
[71:36.68]That last little claw hit.
[71:38.73]He's going to go to phase two.
[71:39.61]Phase two.
[71:40.01]This guy's pretty easy.
[71:46.75]There we go, perfect alignment.
[71:50.39]Keep pinching his eyeball.
[71:59.59]It's my fault I drank a large soda.
[72:01.45]No, I drank a large coffee.
[72:05.35]Couldn't go in.
[72:06.37]Couldn't pull the trigger there.
[72:07.39]I'm sorry, guys.
[72:08.13]Don't call me a bad gamer.
[72:09.35]If you do, you know what happens.
[72:13.99]If you say that I'm bad at the game, you know what happens to you.
[72:18.66]Perfect placement.
[72:26.64]Wow, that thing's amazing.
[72:34.01]Lift it up.
[72:34.73]Let me get under there.
[72:35.49]Let me get under there!
[72:41.38]Wow!
[72:43.16]Wow!
[72:44.26]I'm gonna have to take... Whoa!
[72:47.56]Whoa!
[72:48.72]Oh, he's freaking out!
[72:50.36]He's freaking out right now.
[72:51.44]It has to end now.
[72:53.41]He's freaking out.
[72:54.45]I panicked.
[72:54.97]I have no control.
[72:55.87]I don't know what's happening.
[72:58.63]I'm fine.
[73:03.99]It's because I have to pee so bad!
[73:10.83]No, no bad movements here.
[73:12.61]I'm using it just because I know I'm an idiot.
[73:14.25]No, fuck it up.
[73:19.61]They give you this opportunity to lose right after the boss.
[73:21.89]It sucks.
[73:23.84]Here we go.
[73:25.82]Alright, it's pee time.
[73:30.77]Oh no, it's not pee time yet.
[73:31.71]I have to do this.
[73:32.27]I have to do the shell bonus game.
[73:35.37]It'll be pee time in a minute.
[73:43.90]I shouldn't have drank a large coffee.
[73:46.96]Was I thinking?
[73:50.27]Why did I drink a large coffee at like 7 o'clock?
[73:53.79]What do you think is gonna happen?
[73:56.43]Alright, let me ask you guys something.
[73:57.76]What are the top two things that happen to the human body when you drink a large coffee at night?
[74:06.68]The only two things that are gonna happen is... What is it?
[74:16.29]A huge amount of piss, and you're not gonna go to sleep.
[74:21.61]I need to, like, get back into tea.
[74:22.85]I used to be a real big tea guy.
[74:25.46]I drank a tea last night, but it wasn't satisfying enough to me.
[74:29.84]Get that out of here.
[74:38.73]328.
[74:38.77]Well, I'm gonna get hit.
[74:54.74]I'm gonna hit.
[74:55.20]I'm gonna hit.
[74:55.64]It's alright.
[74:57.92]Can't win them all.
[74:59.50]You know what I'm saying?
[75:00.04]Can't win them all.
[75:06.10]Come on.
[75:11.39]Oh, don't fuck it up now, man.
[75:16.55]Nobody say anything.
[75:18.05]Don't say a goddamn word.
[75:19.53]Thank God.
[75:25.80]I'll be right back.
[75:27.55]Give me a fucking minute.
[75:28.79]Give me a second.
[76:44.58]Wait, what?
[77:56.60]I don't want any liars in my chat, so I want to hear the truth.
[78:00.84]I don't want anybody to tell me any tall tales, any stories, any fibs.
[78:05.39]Tell me this happens to you, because I know it does.
[78:07.85]I know it does.
[78:09.23]I don't even need to ask the question.
[78:11.99]Because I already know.
[78:15.86]Why would I ask the question when I already know?
[78:24.71]Alright, so when you guys go to the bathroom, you really have to go.
[78:27.99]Why am I asking a question I don't even know the answer?
[78:31.50]So when you have to pee really badly, sometimes this happens.
[78:36.96]It's good luck trying to ever tell me that this doesn't.
[78:40.40]You get there, you go to do your business and you just piss directly into the back of like the toilet, left of the toilet into the wall for like a half a second.
[78:51.23]And then you eventually, you know, you correct and everything's fine.
[78:54.14]But that seemed to happen to me, like maybe like 1 out of 10.
[78:59.74]I'd say like maybe 1 out of 20.
[79:01.82]That would happen to me.
[79:03.32]Yeah, it does.
[79:04.96]Don't, don't, I don't want any pretenders.
[79:11.51]It happens all, yes it does.
[79:12.77]Give me a break.
[79:14.25]You go like, you pee and you pee like into the left, top left portion of the toilet seat.
[79:28.35]Just sit down.
[79:29.19]I'm not gonna sit down.
[79:30.63]Hey, you know that like there's a lot of science that says like that's not a terrible idea?
[79:38.60]You want to get into that?
[79:40.56]I'm ready.
[79:53.62]It's always top- No, it's always top left behind the left of the toilet.
[79:58.29]And sometimes, you go like, ah, shit.
[80:01.94]Eh, whatever.
[80:04.02]And you just don't even clean it up.
[80:17.21]Um, look, alright, I gotta calm down.
[80:20.25]Because I'm gonna make, I need to do this now because I'm having a little joke.
[80:28.48]I'm having a little joke right now.
[80:29.64]It's causing me a problem.
[80:30.68]These enemies are hard.
[80:39.39]God damn it.
[80:39.93]I knew it was hard.
[80:41.19]Alright.
[80:41.43]We got a second go here.
[80:44.23]We could do three.
[80:45.23]Is this stupid?
[80:49.45]It's too late.
[80:49.93]I already did it.
[80:50.38]I did it already.
[80:51.14]I was probably done, but I did it.
[81:01.17]Turns out it might not have been stupid.
[81:03.97]Turns out it was actually very great.
[81:05.99]What a good idea that was.
[81:08.59]I need a frog though.
[81:12.32]No, are you guys serious?
[81:13.28]I'm just kidding around.
[81:14.20]You think I actually do that shit?
[81:27.08]What?
[81:27.30]It didn't hit it?
[81:28.00]What?
[81:28.86]Oh, fuck.
[81:32.47]God damn it.
[81:39.62]I gotta pay attention to get him.
[81:41.04]The big guys are gonna be a problem here.
[81:42.82]This is bad.
[81:47.23]Those big guys, I need the frog for those dudes.
[82:00.11]Goddammit, die!
[82:02.72]I made this harder.
[82:04.44]I made it a little harder for me.
[82:06.40]Too many little guys.
[82:13.92]I've recovered a little bit here.
[82:19.76]Everything I say in truth is legally binding.
[82:23.78]Well, that's not true.
[82:24.76]Have you ever seen an infomercial on TV?
[82:27.91]Is all that bullshit legally binding?
[82:31.97]Uh, no.
[82:32.19]Remember that guy that used to sell the books on the infomercials that said it was going to cure all your diseases?
[82:40.66]Did that guy have to fucking legally bind a contract?
[82:47.36]Oh, don't show me this.
[82:54.44]We could do all porcupine and a frog.
[83:07.54]It's already done, so even if it was wrong, it doesn't matter.
[83:09.94]I'm just turning into a hairy chest.
[83:22.17]Frog is for the big guys.
[83:24.43]Everything else is just prey.
[83:26.49]Prey you don't get hit by any... Oh, it's already ruined.
[83:33.64]As long as I focus on one of them.
[83:36.40]Oh my god, he went through the cracks.
[83:40.78]I need to, okay, focus on one of these porcupines and aim with that one.
[83:46.30]Oh man, oh man, what a disaster.
[83:53.68]Freight.
[84:04.36]Actually, this is really bad for this level.
[84:06.90]This will actually be okay in a little bit.
[84:09.40]But for right now, this is not good.
[84:17.98]Spin him around.
[84:18.62]Then I gotta grab this other one.
[84:26.56]Grab it.
[84:27.72]Grab it.
[84:32.40]I think that was a pretty large wave.
[84:40.20]Don't let him just sneak up on you.
[84:41.48]If he gets between the cracks, that's where they have the big issue.
[84:45.80]Fuck, a huge wave.
[84:46.82]This sucks.
[84:47.38]Not good.
[84:48.52]I can do it.
[84:48.94]Just have to focus on one.
[85:00.19]Grab it, come on!
[85:06.33]Got it.
[85:06.89]Yes!
[85:14.35]That was hairy.
[85:20.39]I finally get to see one, but I can't get it because I don't have any money.
[85:25.37]I could get a scallop, which is three hits.
[85:39.20]I'm doing it.
[85:41.87]At this point I need to survive, I just don't have enough money for a Black Mamba.
[85:47.87]We're gonna have to stick with this for now.
[85:57.17]I've beaten the game and I still never bought a Mamba, really?
[86:03.04]I feel like some of these super, super rare items are designed to be there just for you to only build a character around getting one or two of them in the whole run.
[86:19.07]The stealth enemies are really the things that screw me up.
[86:24.60]That's the kind of shit that shouldn't be happening.
[86:28.84]It's the stealth.
[86:29.92]It's having to aim and hit every stealth enemy.
[86:33.47]Oh my fucking god.
[86:41.40]Good thing I bought the dumb hat.
[86:43.40]He's gonna give me a double wave too.
[86:45.06]I'm so happy about this.
[86:48.93]Look at all this shit.
[86:49.61]There's too many.
[86:55.87]I'll be lucky to get out of this one alive.
[87:02.42]This boss, on the other hand, is actually going to be good with the porcupines.
[87:12.05]He just shoots out those stupid idiot guys, the little dudes.
[87:15.50]As long as I'm just facing any direction, he'll get hit.
[87:21.30]So, I'm not concerned about this.
[87:30.91]This guy shoots out stealth enemies, though.
[87:32.97]Which can be a pain in the ass.
[87:35.20]This guy turns into the chainsaw, right?
[87:43.26]Did these guys shoot fast enough for me not to get hit over and over again by that?
[87:49.17]We'll find out.
[87:52.83]We shall see.
[88:01.74]Here comes phase two.
[88:06.40]Stealth guys.
[88:12.50]Keep shooting them out.
[88:13.20]You're getting too close, man.
[88:15.34]Get out of here.
[88:27.48]I'm glad that he doesn't do this again when he gets to phase three.
[88:33.15]That would be such a shit show.
[88:38.73]My aim has to be true, if I have any hope of not getting hit by the chainsaw.
[88:42.70]Well, you know, you take it, and if you can get it, good.
[88:49.66]Here it comes.
[89:03.97]phase three don't let him touch you he's getting closer he's getting closer I'm gonna try to end it on the uh next run he comes through here alright when he comes back I'm gonna use the lady urchin use it
[89:35.94]Is that enough to kill him?
[89:40.11]Not enough.
[89:44.39]Yes it is.
[89:47.39]Usability?
[89:47.97]I was waiting for it to come down.
[89:55.28]Save up shells to buy cool stuff.
[89:58.98]Like that.
[90:00.66]That I can't afford.
[90:01.82]And that's two rolls in a row when we get to see it.
[90:15.21]Mobile game serial streamer.
[90:18.99]Yeah, you just, you give it a try yourself.
[90:24.70]I give birth on stream.
[90:27.85]We're gonna have to get rid of this meme build though.
[90:30.92]Soon.
[90:31.40]And we just keep getting stealthed.
[90:32.98]I don't want... I wish I didn't have the stealth.
[90:35.04]I don't want the Angler.
[90:36.08]He's just a support slot.
[90:39.12]Not doing any damage.
[90:41.27]It's making me very, very fucking upset.
[90:54.84]Jump with the gun.
[90:56.64]And here comes stealth enemies.
[90:59.56]Don't be fooled.
[91:03.12]Don't be fooled by their stealth.
[91:05.32]Get out.
[91:08.23]Alright, this is Paris.
[91:09.15]This is the last stage before the White House, which I have not beaten.
[91:15.51]Let's hope we get there.
[91:16.43]I'm going to use every ounce of ability I have to make sure we can at least see the White House.
[91:27.52]tongue.
[91:29.80]Ribbit, ribbit.
[91:36.67]You gotta have a frog just to take care of the big guys.
[91:39.45]Makes taking care of the huge enemies so much easier.
[91:42.85]Like this guy, for instance.
[91:43.80]He's so difficult.
[91:45.00]What's that?
[91:46.02]He's gone.
[91:53.22]Get it!
[91:56.34]Get it!
[91:58.76]Don't touch that.
[92:03.05]Get it!
[92:03.87]Those little guys, the stupid little stealth guys.
[92:07.71]Just cause so many problemos.
[92:10.71]And what happened there?
[92:12.29]What was that?
[92:14.01]Gosh darn it.
[92:23.91]Don't get catatonic here.
[92:25.49]I think I dragged a frog.
[92:34.03]With the frog, I dragged down one of those sharks so they can hit me.
[92:37.97]Oh well.
[92:50.09]Big dude, big dude, grab him, please.
[92:51.63]Tongue!
[92:52.21]Tongue!
[92:53.07]Thank you.
[92:56.30]That was good.
[92:57.02]That guy shoots missiles in the air and it's not fun.
[93:06.18]I'm gonna use this now, just because.
[93:08.18]Might as well to get the shell building down quickly.
[93:17.47]Perfect.
[93:17.91]Good.
[93:21.82]Look out for the big tank.
[93:23.70]I got my ice peel.
[93:31.71]Could get a starfish, but I don't want to spend the money.
[93:36.91]At this point, I want to try to hold on to money and try to get a black mamba.
[93:40.48]I'm going to try.
[93:41.26]I can't guarantee I'm going to be able to do it.
[93:43.68]We're almost there.
[93:52.75]We all want to see it.
[93:53.57]We want to see how cool it is.
[93:54.51]I also need to unlock more DNA.
[93:58.77]By the way, have I told you how that works?
[94:02.59]It's a really, really interesting concept.
[94:06.89]That's a trot!
[94:08.29]I hate those enemies.
[94:09.95]I hate those things.
[94:12.23]They just sneak in underneath.
[94:14.09]Even after you blow up their body, they swirl around and they get underneath you.
[94:26.96]Oh my fucking god.
[94:32.31]Just use it.
[94:35.17]There's too many random little tiny opportunities to avoid the porcupine fire.
[94:41.31]And I'm doing a huge, huge problem here.
[94:43.55]I'm splitting them up.
[94:44.42]I'm splitting those up into like four sections with the porcupine.
[94:47.74]Because it's hitting them in the body three different places.
[94:52.20]It is not the thing to use against those guys.
[94:59.91]Oh no.
[95:00.77]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[95:02.05]Here they come.
[95:10.32]Away.
[95:16.09]Keep them away from me.
[95:25.76]Don't let him in.
[95:26.60]See?
[95:29.12]What the fuck?
[95:34.43]The tongue just didn't come out in time.
[95:38.33]I have a really bad roll here for enemies.
[95:41.47]I do.
[95:43.27]A bunch of stealth.
[95:47.29]Let me get a goddamn reroll.
[95:50.60]I'm in trouble.
[95:51.88]I need to focus.
[95:53.50]Big time.
[95:58.58]Oh my god.
[96:00.82]Oh.
[96:01.70]My.
[96:02.38]God.
[96:21.57]Fucking stealth, man.
[96:23.49]If I could just get rid of the angler and not have to deal with that shit.
[96:34.34]Let's go.
[96:34.90]I'm getting there.
[96:35.46]Hurry up.
[96:41.29]So, that's... See what I'm talking about?
[96:44.35]Why did I put four porcupines on?
[96:46.05]Whose idea was this?
[96:48.23]And why did I encourage it?
[96:49.57]It was my idea.
[97:01.62]Was it?
[97:01.98]It was my idea?
[97:05.03]Oh, you stupid thing.
[97:09.45]Not one of my better ideas.
[97:11.73]I'm using it.
[97:12.25]I can't go anywhere.
[97:14.07]Four fucking porcupines.
[97:15.25]Fucking idiot.
[97:18.29]That didn't help me.
[97:20.83]Can that projectile please get out of my way?
[97:24.08]Oh my god, it didn't happen.
[97:25.84]Like, where am I supposed to go right here?
[97:29.18]Oh my god, it's just over.
[97:31.24]This was a bad move.
[97:32.58]This was a very bad decision.
[97:35.74]I need to just try to get to the end as quick as I can.
[97:38.20]And hopefully have enough money to put something else here besides boardplay.
[97:42.05]This is so much money too.
[97:43.13]This is like $6,000.
[97:43.67]What a $6,000 awful joke.
[97:54.72]Get out of the way.
[97:56.18]Another huge wave.
[97:56.94]I have to get rid of these stupid sharks before I do anything stupid.
[98:00.67]Stupid, stupid, everything's stupid.
[98:01.97]Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[98:03.35]Stupid.
[98:04.37]I'm gonna use the word stupid.
[98:11.65]Keep moving this way.
[98:12.57]I actually was in a- not a bad position for that.
[98:18.56]Everything's so stupid.
[98:28.08]No, no.
[98:28.80]Not more of you.
[98:32.34]Get away.
[98:32.82]Alright, I made it.
[98:35.87]I made it with at least full health.
[98:37.01]That's a good thing I had three damage taker.
[98:42.97]Stupid.
[98:43.27]Everything is stupid.
[98:44.13]The whole world is stupid.
[98:49.71]We're getting close though.
[98:50.37]That's a good thing.
[98:53.73]I have 5700 bucks.
[98:58.47]Speaking of stupid things, I'm replacing one of these porcupines with a heavy lobster.
[99:06.17]I'm going to.
[99:07.17]That's just the way it is.
[99:14.07]Here we are.
[99:17.65]Now I'm not just totally cashed in to the idea of only using porcupines.
[99:28.89]It really is unbelievable how much I've fucked myself.
[99:31.85]Those guys split into sections and I have an enemy that shoots all their sections.
[99:36.71]What the fuck?
[99:38.75]You see what I mean?
[100:01.68]Get out of the way!
[100:03.92]When does he move?
[100:15.91]I have to focus on shooting those first.
[100:18.61]Regardless of anything else that's on the screen.
[100:21.11]Those guys gotta go.
[100:22.89]Immediately.
[100:28.35]I'm calling myself.
[100:29.37]What do I mean I'm calling myself?
[100:36.52]That's fine.
[100:37.02]Good.
[100:41.77]Crab Claw is specifically here to destroy buildings with his massive damage up close.
[100:50.13]I'm gonna move over here.
[100:54.19]Too many units to decloak.
[101:02.28]There we go.
[101:05.53]This guy was really not that bad.
[101:10.09]It sounds like it'll be kind of hard to hit him.
[101:14.15]Because I can only reach with the porcupine.
[101:16.15]We're just going to stand right here.
[101:19.57]Don't even move.
[101:21.51]Not even worth it.
[101:24.11]We're only going to move to get a better position to shoot him right in the head.
[101:31.05]Not bad.
[101:31.67]Not bad damage.
[101:33.40]I've seen better.
[101:41.31]What does this boss do?
[101:42.59]Nothing until the second phase.
[101:45.17]He just freaks you out a little bit.
[101:46.97]Until he turns into an angry man.
[101:50.15]Which should be happening any second here.
[101:54.72]There it is.
[101:56.18]Now I gotta be careful.
[102:00.96]He shoots out all this electricity.
[102:03.82]And it'll get you.
[102:04.54]It'll zap you.
[102:14.40]I want to crab claw him.
[102:16.99]Not going to happen though.
[102:19.35]Yes it is.
[102:20.37]Ah!
[102:20.85]Nope.
[102:28.27]It's just, I'm going to use it just so I can have it.
[102:29.63]Here comes his face.
[102:34.56]Lean in.
[102:35.70]Is it far enough?
[102:36.28]It's not close enough.
[102:38.60]Oh well.
[102:39.60]At least do this much damage.
[102:45.37]This guy probably is the easiest boss.
[102:47.61]Phase 3 gets a little harder, but not really.
[102:53.47]Man, you gonna be in range of me to do this now?
[102:57.46]Yes.
[102:58.48]Perfect.
[102:59.00]One more.
[102:59.68]One more.
[103:08.39]What does he even do in Phase 3?
[103:09.37]I forget.
[103:12.15]Oh, he got the giant French bread.
[103:13.41]I forgot.
[103:13.81]Yeah, I gotta be careful.
[103:21.45]What do these do?
[103:21.89]If I touch these, I get stunned.
[103:25.79]Which, as you can imagine, is not something you want to be standing still in this game.
[103:28.87]You don't want to be doing that.
[103:29.75]I can grab these with the frog.
[103:31.19]Didn't even know that.
[103:31.81]That's pretty cool.
[103:40.82]Move in.
[103:47.12]Oh, I can't really.
[103:48.46]I'm just going to use this.
[103:52.15]Bring the head over here.
[103:52.77]Come on.
[103:53.27]Let me get a couple of hits.
[103:59.29]Good.
[104:00.21]Good.
[104:02.80]Down he goes.
[104:03.34]We're going to get to go to the White House.
[104:06.76]And get way more cool stuff.
[104:11.44]Don't hit me with that.
[104:18.51]Mimes are cool.
[104:21.43]Can you even be a mime anymore?
[104:22.95]Does it even exist?
[104:23.65]Is that an actual... Is it still an occupation?
[104:31.23]He's gonna go right into it.
[104:32.15]No, he's not.
[104:32.81]Oh, well.
[104:42.38]No, it's illegal.
[104:44.50]Being a mime is illegal?
[104:46.96]What?
[104:49.73]Why is being a mime illegal?
[104:51.01]Kill him before he does it.
[104:51.77]Kill him before he does it!
[104:52.53]Kill him before he does it!
[104:58.07]Gotcha.
[105:00.86]Not enough for a Mamba.
[105:05.02]Maybe they will be after this.
[105:14.73]I could never be in mine.
[105:16.39]You can't talk, right?
[105:18.57]God, that would be impossible.
[105:21.77]I can barely stop talking for 10 seconds, let alone a whole day on the street.
[105:27.25]Because what if somebody's an asshole?
[105:28.37]Somebody's typically, usually somebody's an asshole, right?
[105:31.45]They'll come up to you, they'll like take a picture of your selfie, like give you the finger.
[105:34.96]I'd be like, fuck you.
[105:36.84]You know what I mean?
[105:38.38]You'd be like, hey, buddy, fuck yourself.
[105:41.72]And then you're not a mime anymore, you're just a guy with a funny costume on and makeup on his face.
[105:50.82]I could never be a British Bobby either.
[105:52.90]You know, the guys that stand outside of Palace.
[105:57.35]And everyone tries to go up and make them laugh.
[105:59.59]What are they called?
[106:00.01]The Great British Bobbies.
[106:03.73]And they wear the big cigars on their heads.
[106:07.15]I couldn't be one of those guys.
[106:16.89]Being on the statues would be even worse.
[106:18.63]Oh, they're called... What are they called?
[106:25.40]Bobby's... Yeah, but you guys know what I'm talking about.
[106:30.04]The Queen's Guard.
[106:39.47]Wait, you guys never heard of the Great British Bobby?
[106:54.20]They're called beef eaters?
[106:57.42]What an awkward situation if you were a vegetarian.
[107:00.88]Hey, you're a vegetarian?
[107:06.34]You're a vegan?
[107:07.22]Yes, I am.
[107:08.06]But you're also a beef eater.
[107:09.52]Yes.
[107:09.78]So what is it, man?
[107:15.92]What is it?
[107:16.28]Which one are you?
[107:27.35]And then his face would turn bright red.
[107:29.17]Oh shit, I don't want to lose.
[107:36.04]I need these shells!
[107:38.38]Can you lose the bonus game?
[107:39.78]I'm about to find out.
[107:59.98]Okay, we're fine.
[108:04.53]Dang it, Bobby.
[108:09.43]Alright, now it's time... We don't have any... Black Mambas.
[108:14.23]I can buy an extra life, but no.
[108:15.84]I don't need it yet.
[108:18.16]Here comes the point of the game we were at last time.
[108:20.86]Destroy the White House.
[108:23.88]This is where the game... This is where it gets real.
[108:25.90]Because this shit was fucking hard last time.
[108:30.52]I need to actually be quiet and concentrate on this one.
[108:32.96]Okay, this is where they stop fucking around.
[108:48.52]I really could use that Mamba, though.
[108:51.12]Replace the Angler.
[108:59.05]At least we'll make a bunch of money here.
[109:06.70]Save the superpower.
[109:07.76]I only have one superpower, though.
[109:10.68]It's kind of sucky.
[109:13.04]It looks like I can get rid of the angler.
[109:16.18]I'm going to preemptively use this just to be safe.
[109:20.34]And I didn't even... I'm very upset about that.
[109:24.56]Actually, very, very upset about that one.
[109:33.32]Fucking porcupines There's no reason to do this and like I was looking for an attempt to try to beat the game and I made it I made the attempt a joke And look at the time it seemed like a fun idea right it still is I'll use it as an excuse
[110:05.44]There's just they just don't shoot fast enough and there's too much room for error for them to spread The spread is so large.
[110:12.20]You know, you only need one of these things I need the money money Now give me a black mamba and let me beat the game Come on, please
[110:43.01]I need to get rid of you quickly, not this slow.
[110:49.07]We're good.
[110:50.81]Everything's fine.
[110:53.87]Not anymore.
[110:54.28]Alright.
[111:05.50]Here comes the huge wave.
[111:07.98]Prepare yourself.
[111:16.58]Any minute now, it's going to say, dun dun, huge wave.
[111:20.16]And I'm going to get really nervous.
[111:30.51]Here it comes.
[111:35.41]Out of the way.
[111:40.82]Get rid of this angler ASAP.
[111:47.79]Come on, get rid of him before the wave comes.
[111:50.54]Thank you.
[111:52.04]Alright, time to... Should I activate it now?
[111:53.74]What do you think?
[111:54.18]Yep.
[111:56.98]Still got him.
[111:57.62]Doesn't fucking matter.
[112:01.53]I can't move.
[112:03.35]I couldn't move.
[112:04.75]These stupid balls!
[112:08.39]I'm dead.
[112:08.89]Yep.
[112:09.21]Oh, fuck.
[112:14.28]That was an impossible encounter.
[112:16.22]I couldn't do anything.
[112:17.10]It's the stupid little laser ball that you can't dodge.
[112:20.85]Fuck.
[112:22.77]What do I do here?
[112:32.37]I could do 9, 8, 7.
[112:33.49]I could do extra life on a cobra.
[112:37.85]No black mamba.
[112:40.17]Shit.
[112:40.37]Shit.
[112:47.58]That's what we're gonna do.
[112:48.26]I think I'm actually gonna... I think chicken might actually be okay here.
[112:57.88]To get rid of one of these.
[112:59.48]Or maybe even a little cobra.
[113:00.80]I'm gonna keep this.
[113:10.83]No claw?
[113:11.63]No, but the claw... If people get in close enough, it helps.
[113:18.46]The Cobra is so important though.
[113:19.80]I can get rid of so many of those little enemies by aiming just the Cobra.
[113:22.90]Alright, here we go.
[113:25.90]This is going to be the one.
[113:26.82]We're going to get to the next level at least.
[113:29.74]Or maybe not.
[113:30.12]Maybe I'll just lose.
[113:30.71]I wonder what does more damage.
[113:38.09]Aiming the Cobra or trying to get all three shots with the Porcupine.
[113:41.31]We'll find out.
[113:55.90]Preemptive.
[113:56.36]I ain't taking any fucking... I... I... What happened there?
[114:01.40]I'm like saying I'm not taking any unnecessary damage and I just got hit.
[114:04.47]As I was saying it.
[114:07.37]Fuck.
[114:08.43]I don't even know... Oh my... Jesus.
[114:13.19]Pay attention.
[114:14.81]Pay attention.
[114:16.83]Jesus Christ.
[114:20.02]I'm being... I'm shutting the fuck up now.
[114:35.86]Bad Still alive Pass please
[115:19.39]Here it comes.
[115:21.11]Don't fuck around.
[115:23.93]Just do it.
[115:25.67]Just like that Nike commercial.
[115:45.47]I need to get to the next level at least, so I can unlock more DNA.
[115:49.83]Very necessary.
[115:50.57]Okay.
[116:03.39]Good.
[116:04.37]Easy.
[116:14.74]Keep it up.
[116:15.94]No talking.
[116:17.28]No talking.
[116:28.83]God, I can be so forgetful.
[116:30.38]I can be so forgetful sometimes.
[116:46.14]I need that thing recharged right now.
[117:04.94]Christ!
[117:10.52]Made it.
[117:12.90]Come on, break it!
[117:13.58]Nice, good.
[117:19.82]Good enough.
[117:29.05]I don't have, this is not, none of this is good.
[117:34.33]Can you hit the big fish with the frog?
[117:36.05]No, you can't, unfortunately.
[117:37.09]You can't grab the big guy.
[117:42.30]None of these are worth replacing.
[117:43.42]I'm just gonna save.
[117:50.33]If I can at least get out of the water here before losing, I'd be happy.
[117:55.47]But that's not- we're gonna use the mindset that I'm gonna win, even though my build is terrible.
[118:00.37]And now I need stealth.
[118:02.25]Oh boy, well, say goodbye to this one!
[118:05.68]This one ain't happening.
[118:06.52]It's gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle to do this one.
[118:20.47]That strategy works.
[118:26.80]I'm going to have to pull that off every time.
[118:41.78]Focus on that again.
[118:42.41]Don't want to accidentally grab one of the little ones.
[118:45.01]Going to grab this guy right here.
[118:46.27]Big guy right here.
[118:47.53]Come on.
[118:48.33]Don't turn yet.
[118:49.69]Got it.
[119:03.77]That's how you get it done.
[119:15.08]No damage at all.
[119:17.62]I'll take that.
[119:18.12]Just gotta do that again.
[119:19.88]I can do it like two more times.
[119:38.66]Who needs the Angler?
[119:40.18]Huh?
[119:41.69]Not this guy!
[119:43.55]Duh, it's gonna get hairy here though.
[120:02.06]Bullets are everywhere.
[120:03.72]Just be mindful of where they are.
[120:11.69]Break it down.
[120:12.25]I have to get rid of this before the next wave gets in here.
[120:14.05]Come on.
[120:16.07]Land the shots.
[120:19.47]Got it.
[120:23.48]Here we go again.
[120:25.48]This guy's going to be first.
[120:32.94]Who's going to be next?
[120:33.50]This guy right up top.
[120:54.14]This is a lot of them though.
[120:55.50]There are a lot of them.
[120:56.80]And I currently am holding one.
[120:58.02]Which one's coming in first?
[120:58.70]Bottom right.
[121:00.07]Bingo.
[121:00.37]This dude here.
[121:01.29]Nope.
[121:01.55]Top right.
[121:01.99]Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking.
[121:05.49]This is where it falls apart.
[121:06.59]We're good.
[121:11.83]Oh no.
[121:12.19]I gotta get rid of this.
[121:13.05]That's what's screwing the whole thing up.
[121:15.55]That's messing the whole thing up.
[121:16.55]Calm down.
[121:17.05]Easy.
[121:17.39]Shh.
[121:25.07]Oh no!
[121:25.53]Don't grab that guy!
[121:28.73]Right here!
[121:29.11]Bingo!
[121:34.91]Almost there.
[121:46.98]No angler either.
[121:47.70]I'm gonna have to do that shit again.
[121:54.81]That sucks.
[122:00.44]I'm not entirely sure.
[122:01.62]Penguin actually might not be terrible here to replace the claw.
[122:08.70]I might put the penguin on just to have a little bit more... Get a turtle.
[122:14.98]I guess I could do the turtle with the claw.
[122:21.17]The claw is getting out of here in either the penguin or the turtle.
[122:32.29]I think I got one more in me.
[122:37.89]I think we're gonna hold on to the money.
[122:48.25]Damn it.
[122:55.88]I'm gonna hold it.
[123:01.15]That's gonna do what I just did again, but who knows we might not get a bunch of stealth enemies this time Of course we are Just gonna do it again Kill it kill it
[123:29.73]As long as I get rid of this thing before the next wave shows up, then I'm going to be fine.
[123:34.06]But it has to go as soon as possible.
[123:37.64]It means I have to land 90% of these shots, which is kind of hard to do that.
[123:44.72]I've got to help up.
[123:47.30]Alright, which one's coming in first?
[123:49.67]Top left?
[123:50.67]Or top right?
[123:51.45]Which one?
[123:52.27]This one.
[123:58.36]Oh no, a jellyfish.
[123:59.52]Oh no.
[124:01.22]That's bad.
[124:02.20]I can't do anything about this.
[124:04.72]I don't have the push.
[124:06.30]I can't do anything.
[124:06.82]I'm going to have to get hit.
[124:07.64]I'm going to get hit every time.
[124:11.17]That sucks.
[124:11.77]I don't have a Snuffleupagus.
[124:13.77]God damn it.
[124:14.65]I'm so screwed.
[124:18.21]Can I somehow manage to get through this level?
[124:22.03]I don't think so.
[124:22.55]I don't think it's possible without an elephant.
[124:25.63]It's impossible.
[124:27.11]Oh well.
[124:28.76]Oh well.
[124:29.14]I just freaked out.
[124:39.69]Wait, those can be dodged.
[124:41.17]They've never gotten close enough for me to even know that's possible.
[124:43.67]So, okay.
[124:44.21]I'm gonna try.
[124:47.37]No, I'm too fucked up right now.
[124:48.59]We have to start over.
[124:50.29]Yeah, just start it over.
[124:52.41]Just start it over and let me like get... Let me please get like a better build here.
[125:00.55]Alright, we got an angler situation.
[125:04.79]What if I were to replace a porcupine?
[125:27.11]Mmm, I think I don't have very much damage at that point though That's it that's a scary thing to try By a tentacle, yeah, I could do a tentacle too But what could I afford after that I guess anything yeah, let's do it Put it here
[125:55.65]And then what am I doing here?
[125:56.97]Angler?
[126:00.65]The porcupines are fucking horrible.
[126:05.15]Remember, there are loads of tiers and stuff that I haven't gotten with shells.
[126:07.72]Oh, yeah, I know.
[126:09.16]I'm not expecting to beat it right here.
[126:11.30]Because I only have, like, tier 3 stuff, and I need, like, tier 4.
[126:17.38]I'm going to assume that I'm up against a wall right now, technically.
[126:24.04]Is it angler or elephant?
[126:26.02]I don't know.
[126:27.84]Probably angler.
[126:29.98]Somebody's just like, B!
[126:32.60]I'm gonna do angler just because I won't have to freak out every time.
[126:45.25]I could replace the frog or a porcupine.
[126:47.35]I could do both, but then I lose damage.
[127:03.71]It's been done.
[127:04.17]Let's hope it was the right call.
[127:09.11]I wonder if I should put a bee instead of a porcupine.
[127:11.93]It's done.
[127:17.38]I'm ready.
[127:35.38]Alright, I already feel a little less panicked.
[127:41.01]The panic is not set in now.
[127:48.80]I think we'll get through this.
[127:54.36]You know what?
[127:55.04]Turtle shell, turns out, might be a good call.
[127:57.83]Really.
[127:58.11]Go away.
[128:02.66]Just blocking those is so key because you're just so hamstringed by having to dodge these.
[128:11.16]I still think I'm gonna be alright.
[128:12.48]We'll at least get to the land.
[128:15.00]Got a lot of upgrades to do anyways.
[128:28.83]Easy.
[128:38.90]I got a little bit of confidence now.
[128:46.35]Where's it going?
[128:48.49]What?
[128:52.15]Yikes.
[128:55.29]Oh, yikes, Jeremy.
[128:56.17]Yikes!
[128:56.65]Yikes!
[128:59.38]Just wasn't paying attention to those.
[129:11.37]Come on, ding-dong him.
[129:14.98]We're there.
[129:15.32]Huge wave and we're done.
[129:16.56]I only get hit one time.
[129:17.28]That's fine.
[129:19.54]What is this?
[129:20.78]Oh, no.
[129:21.24]It's a fucking... It's a new enemy.
[129:22.68]Oh, no.
[129:23.10]What does he do?
[129:24.16]Oh, I don't want this.
[129:26.37]Hard shell.
[129:28.03]Okay, open up.
[129:28.61]It's just like Mega Man.
[129:30.53]I can grab him.
[129:32.05]Frog OP at this boss.
[129:35.25]Good thing I have the frog.
[129:39.50]potentially makes this encounter incredibly simple.
[129:49.22]Although he has a second phase, whatever it is.
[129:50.70]What are you doing?
[129:57.05]What?
[129:57.55]What is this?
[130:03.69]I think I know what I'm... I'm gonna assume that the play here is we probably have to run him into one.
[130:09.25]Yep.
[130:11.79]I was correct.
[130:15.39]Just gonna do it again.
[130:16.11]Got it.
[130:24.60]Not so bad.
[130:25.26]I freaked out for no reason.
[130:26.20]He seems pretty self-explanatory.
[130:29.77]Shoot him up.
[130:30.21]Come on.
[130:33.11]Let's see it.
[130:37.23]Walk right into that.
[130:40.41]Don't do that to me though.
[130:41.83]Get hit again.
[130:42.31]I just got money for doing that.
[130:46.43]Phase 3 incoming, whatever it is.
[130:49.97]No?
[130:51.55]I guess not yet.
[130:52.09]1 trillion IQ.
[131:00.79]Yeah, this guy's a chump.
[131:04.05]Chump alert.
[131:08.07]Oh no.
[131:09.95]Why did I have to say chump alert?
[131:18.66]Got it.
[131:18.88]No, I'm sorry.
[131:24.26]He's still a chump.
[131:25.32]Still chump alert.
[131:25.98]I'm gonna use the ladybug next time.
[131:30.48]When he gets shocked again.
[131:37.14]Come on.
[131:41.53]Run into it.
[131:42.31]Please.
[131:42.73]Alright, now get over there.
[131:47.27]Get over there.
[131:48.27]Why?
[131:48.69]Get over there and shoot him.
[131:51.66]Oh my fucking god.
[131:52.92]Shoot him.
[131:57.34]Got it.
[132:03.22]How hard did I fail biology?
[132:04.54]Pretty terribly, actually.
[132:07.46]I got straight Fs.
[132:10.75]May have unlocked a new DNA.
[132:13.03]No?
[132:18.29]I like this setup.
[132:19.21]Although, wait a minute.
[132:19.87]We're going to land now, aren't we?
[132:22.40]Alright.
[132:22.90]I'm going to assume Lobster replaces Snuffleupagus, right?
[132:31.62]I'm not putting another Porcupine on.
[132:37.37]This doesn't need to be here, though, right?
[132:42.49]Claw should replace... It's not Belophagus.
[132:49.88]No, wait, but the claw's for the buildings.
[132:54.48]Replace the bee.
[132:57.06]Replace the bee with a... I don't want to replace the bee.
[133:00.78]The elephant doesn't do anything.
[133:02.08]Are there land jellyfishes?
[133:05.71]We have never gotten this far.
[133:06.73]I don't know.
[133:07.31]Are jellyfishes on the land?
[133:11.48]It's probably going to be stealth.
[133:14.14]The bee is bad.
[133:21.38]This is the first time we've ever seen this.
[133:23.73]So let's just see what we have to deal with.
[133:27.99]Here we are.
[133:28.51]Washington, D.C.
[133:29.09]Because there really might be land...
[133:58.87]That guy is strong.
[134:01.15]You know how hard it is to do that to a laminated card?
[134:05.36]He killed that guy.
[134:07.24]Holy shit, he's murdering that guy.
[134:08.70]He's like crushing that guy into a thousand pieces.
[134:12.62]Oh, no.
[134:14.42]New enemies.
[134:16.97]Oh, Jesus.
[134:17.53]Okay, this is where the game begins.
[134:19.09]They're very close.
[134:29.96]Oh, God.
[134:35.70]Just get me to some new... Give me some more money.
[134:37.48]Give me some more shells.
[134:40.41]This might be a wash, boys.
[134:42.61]And girls.
[134:48.71]Grab.
[134:50.24]I'm gonna swing you around.
[134:51.96]Whoa!
[134:52.14]Fuck!
[135:02.55]So it does turn out that the elephant is a 100% useless thing to have here.
[135:11.57]I just didn't know if there was another enemy type that you needed to push back.
[135:15.37]Because it was very possible, right?
[135:26.21]I think we're going to be fine.
[135:27.79]We'll make it to the next level, I think.
[135:29.37]I say that as I'm getting collapsed on.
[135:40.27]Grab him, please.
[135:41.01]Tongue far.
[135:47.82]Out of the line of sight there.
[135:49.46]Good.
[135:52.52]Ah, fuck.
[135:53.14]Don't.
[135:53.50]God.
[135:54.98]I should have gotten hit there.
[135:55.92]I should not have taken that damage.
[136:02.61]What's with all the bee hate?
[136:03.61]I love the bees.
[136:04.97]The bees actually do a lot of work.
[136:18.39]easy now no careless mistakes not right now yeah sweet queen bee is god tier I don't even I don't I don't even have the second tier of the bee do I
[136:48.65]So, there's that.
[136:49.43]I feel like I'm missing a lot of... Oh, shit.
[136:55.36]Fuck.
[136:55.72]I kind of got myself rolled into a corner there.
[136:58.66]There's nothing I can do.
[136:59.28]Maybe I could have tilted up a little bit, but... All my damage is too spread out.
[137:11.77]I gotta move, man.
[137:12.69]I gotta move.
[137:13.39]Alright, we're good.
[137:19.32]I have a charge here.
[137:20.40]I'm going to use it.
[137:22.36]Not right this second.
[137:25.41]There's no reason to.
[137:26.15]That was the wave I just took.
[137:27.11]Now I'm going to... Oh, yeah.
[137:28.19]Now I'm going to do that.
[137:28.87]Jesus Christ.
[137:40.40]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[137:41.24]I have to get rid of him before a wave comes.
[137:42.52]Please.
[137:43.28]Goodbye.
[138:03.72]Flawless.
[138:11.66]God damn it.
[138:12.82]I waited too long.
[138:15.52]No!
[138:17.85]Go, go, go, go, go.
[138:20.39]Ah, that sucks.
[138:23.55]Here's the end.
[138:24.23]Alright.
[138:24.53]Just use everything I got.
[138:25.97]Take the building down.
[138:26.67]Hurry up.
[138:36.77]So, turns out, I need to do some rethinking here.
[138:43.59]This is fucking wonderful.
[138:50.39]A tier one snake.
[138:52.55]Chicken, penguin, elephant, and a frog.
[138:54.68]It's chicken.
[139:01.76]It has to be.
[139:05.99]I think this is going to be the end.
[139:08.23]I got the worst possible roll I could have gotten.
[139:13.42]It might be chicken.
[139:14.74]Chicken replaces elephant.
[139:18.82]And then maybe the penguin will replace something here.
[139:28.75]Two frogs.
[139:31.55]I could do two frogs, but there's been a lot of tiny enemies.
[139:36.27]There hasn't been a lot of large, large enemies to deal with.
[139:42.20]I feel like having the chicken and these exploding eggs will take care of a lot of the small enemies.
[139:45.24]I'm going to go with my gut.
[139:51.51]Replace... I could do frog for B. Or I could do frog penguin for B.
[140:11.28]That's what we're gonna do.
[140:13.30]Good luck.
[140:16.02]We're at the second to last level.
[140:17.86]I'm probably gonna lose here, and then that gives us an opportunity to level up.
[140:23.07]But those eggs are... Okay, now we have gigantic stuff.
[140:26.53]Alright, great.
[140:27.19]Well, good thing I have the frog still.
[140:31.64]Imagine if I had gotten rid of the frog.
[140:42.36]I'm gonna use this every opportunity I have.
[140:52.81]Alright, let's grab that.
[140:58.24]Oh, dear god in heaven.
[141:01.74]I'm fucked.
[141:04.16]Somehow made it out of that one.
[141:13.02]alright come on chicken show your usefulness the chicken sucks it was a mistake oh frog what hit me something behind me alright keep going
[141:43.19]Should've done the double frog.
[141:44.11]You know, coulda, woulda, shoulda.
[141:49.29]I'm in so much trouble.
[141:50.59]I'm way too fucking spread out.
[141:52.01]I have too many animals.
[141:53.56]It's alright.
[141:54.20]We were inevitably gonna lose anyways.
[141:57.00]I have no tier 4.
[141:58.32]I have no actual upgrade.
[142:02.10]Do it again.
[142:05.86]I need some actual tier 4 items.
[142:12.25]I need to get a good roll.
[142:12.97]I need to save money.
[142:13.67]I need to do it correct.
[142:14.55]I need to upgrade.
[142:15.33]Too many animals.
[142:17.75]Alright, with any luck I might actually get to this next level.
[142:22.71]Maybe.
[142:23.47]Defends.
[142:23.87]I need a lot of luck though.
[142:39.12]Just roll forward.
[142:40.08]I should be doing that every time.
[142:45.15]I'm getting zapped.
[142:45.96]Double wave.
[142:46.68]Thank you.
[142:47.14]That's great.
[142:47.72]Now we lose.
[142:52.70]Shit.
[142:53.58]Shit.
[142:54.42]Shit.
[142:55.16]Shit.
[142:55.46]It's over.
[143:05.43]Well, we desperately need this.
[143:11.46]Because this will tell us what's on the next level.
[143:16.17]I get another heart here.
[143:17.32]I still have plenty of upgrades.
[143:20.32]Queen bee.
[143:23.12]Conch pelican goldfish.
[143:25.76]Gives you gold.
[143:28.48]Start with $50 extra slot.
[143:31.55]Queen bee.
[143:32.71]Queen bee.
[143:38.23]Rooster.
[143:38.67]Here we go.
[143:38.97]Here's like the upgrade to the eggs.
[143:42.61]Could start with four tentacles.
[143:43.83]That's actually a pretty big deal.
[143:49.52]Goldfish is amazing early game, I can imagine.
[143:53.86]Clonch is four hits being blocked.
[143:58.39]I feel like I don't know what I want here.
[143:59.85]I think retaliation is just so cheap, just take it.
[144:03.19]Bigger retaliation, okay.
[144:04.47]I'll do the goldfish.
[144:11.68]No more goldfish here.
[144:15.56]Start with 50 bucks, extra lab slot.
[144:18.02]Retaliation again.
[144:23.47]Or Rooster DNA, that might be good.
[144:28.37]Let's take that.
[144:34.72]Bigger retaliation.
[144:37.98]Alright, I did bigger retaliation, and now I get another heart too.
[144:42.64]So... Pelican or Conch.
[144:46.78]Or start with 50 bucks.
[144:50.71]Because now we'll get two more hearts than we had before.
[145:01.14]Extra lab?
[145:01.78]I don't have any.
[145:02.46]I only have 125.
[145:04.32]Pelican?
[145:06.08]Frog is better than the pelican.
[145:11.57]Um... I don't even know what it does.
[145:15.45]Well, let's try it.
[145:17.09]That gives us another heart slot!
[145:22.69]Unlock limb number nine.
[145:24.37]There's like more shit to buy and more hearts to get.
[145:27.47]This is why this game is just an addicting fucking mess.
[145:33.25]Okay.
[145:36.43]So we're going to get to see that every single level.
[145:41.95]I got two extra hearts.
[145:43.45]Let's skip ahead a little bit here.
[145:49.29]Here's a pelican right now.
[145:52.63]Should I put the pelican on?
[145:53.73]No, but this is like the first level.
[145:56.59]Enemies on the next level.
[145:57.45]Here we go.
[145:58.65]Invisible planes, missile tanks, and armored plane.
[146:05.20]Are we just gonna put the pill- It's $900!
[146:09.77]What did it- Oh, we're gonna lose.
[146:11.71]Maybe not.
[146:12.25]Let's see.
[146:15.29]It depends on how long it takes to recharge him eating something.
[146:21.66]Well, this could be the end.
[146:24.30]Does he do anything else?
[146:26.08]No.
[146:27.88]And they're invisible.
[146:28.74]Let's hope we can- Alright, let's try it.
[146:31.13]Eat this guy.
[146:37.50]What are they doing?
[146:39.82]What?
[146:41.22]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[146:42.56]Does he not kill them?
[146:47.80]That has to be incorrect, right?
[146:53.31]Maybe I have to smash his mouth into the ground?
[146:59.33]Swallow it.
[147:03.21]He just spits... Okay, no, no, no, they go away.
[147:05.55]He can eat multiple things at the same time, too.
[147:14.46]Can I spit him into things?
[147:16.49]That might be useful.
[147:17.87]Let's see.
[147:24.92]Yes.
[147:28.02]This is like some extreme utility here.
[147:31.52]I'm not so sure about this one.
[147:40.92]Should have shot him with the chest.
[147:42.20]Yeah, I know.
[147:42.76]You're right.
[147:43.16]That didn't even destroy it.
[147:51.02]God damn it.
[147:55.68]Well, this might be a redo.
[147:57.67]This is a redo situation, I think.
[148:04.79]The damage seems to be fun.
[148:06.63]I guess you could do frogs and pelicans and it would be interesting.
[148:14.10]He's essentially a frog that can deal with more than one thing at the same time.
[148:19.42]But, like, right now, not a good early game.
[148:25.60]It's good to try it now instead of later.
[148:26.97]That's true.
[148:28.53]It's good to know this now rather than, like, at the second to last level in the game.
[148:33.95]What's the pelican do?
[148:40.49]Oh, let's get some shells.
[148:41.94]Let's not make this a complete waste of time.
[148:44.90]Let's try to get another upgrade or something.
[148:49.61]Does it go through the building?
[148:51.49]Alright, that's actually pretty good.
[148:54.75]That's pretty good.
[148:56.77]How many things can he eat?
[148:59.97]Seems like it's a cone in front of you.
[149:08.33]I could see this being really, really useful as just a straight up utility.
[149:14.30]Not so sure about here though.
[149:21.06]Oh, whatever.
[149:24.37]Cloverfield Paradox is a mess.
[149:27.05]Doesn't that movie suck?
[149:31.53]Can we salvage this at all?
[149:38.21]Damn it.
[149:40.65]This sucks.
[149:44.01]Invisible planes.
[149:45.21]Oh, this is awful.
[149:46.13]That's too bad.
[150:00.37]Can't do the queen bee.
[150:02.37]I would do the angler right now, but...
[150:05.13]Kind of just still in test mode.
[150:10.89]So what I guess what I could do is I could freeze all these things and like group them up together and then eat them.
[150:15.85]But that required, I'm gonna get hit by this.
[150:18.79]Cool.
[150:23.21]Two birds, one dick.
[150:28.61]Yes, I guess.
[150:32.93]Why are you shooting it over there, buddy?
[150:35.58]Come on, buddy.
[150:42.60]Look, this might be a salvageable run.
[150:49.30]It's not like it's a total waste.
[150:57.71]Aiming that is a little difficult, but it's alright.
[151:15.33]Uh-huh.
[151:18.61]Shoot it.
[151:19.17]Oh, it crossed everybody.
[151:24.26]Slow and steady loses the race.
[151:36.35]Yeah, Pella... I would rather have the frog.
[151:38.41]I just would.
[151:45.26]I mean, I can imagine a situation where this would be very, very useful.
[151:50.68]The boss is going to be agony.
[151:53.86]Not if I can unlock an actual weapon here.
[152:00.75]I'm in trouble, though.
[152:03.59]Yes, I am.
[152:04.07]Maybe not.
[152:08.95]Shoot it.
[152:10.29]Shoot him, please.
[152:11.38]Throw it up!
[152:12.62]Was there a reason why that took extra long to do that?
[152:17.92]Hold on a minute.
[152:19.46]I need to test something here.
[152:21.50]Can I hold onto it if it's crushing his mouth?
[152:24.91]Come here.
[152:26.23]Right?
[152:27.83]Does he shoot it anyways?
[152:28.59]Alright, you can hold it.
[152:32.29]I see.
[152:32.73]Okay, you can actually hold onto that shit.
[152:34.55]You don't have to do it.
[152:35.11]You can just keep it in his mouth.
[152:36.63]And he won't fire it.
[152:41.11]That changes it a little bit.
[152:50.83]Interesting.
[152:57.16]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[152:58.12]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[153:02.32]Well, oh well.
[153:07.25]Uh, I feel like maybe.
[153:10.06]Unless I get something.
[153:11.48]Because this was $900.
[153:12.84]That's such a massive waste of money early game.
[153:18.98]It might not be the worst idea just to die and let it restart.
[153:21.38]I'm gonna get hit by the nukes.
[153:32.24]Shoot it!
[153:38.10]Can you eat a nuke?
[153:38.98]Maybe.
[153:42.06]We'll try it.
[153:45.63]We'll never know.
[153:51.63]Manually restart via the menu.
[153:53.55]Well, here's the reason why that probably won't work.
[153:57.64]Because you can exit to the main menu, but you can only continue.
[154:01.24]You can press new game, but I'm afraid to do that.
[154:04.53]Because if I press new game, it might restart the whole thing from the very beginning, right?
[154:10.72]I'm not sure if that's how it works.
[154:12.06]It might.
[154:12.70]Maybe not.
[154:18.28]This is all garbage, too.
[154:23.98]This is a terrible scenario.
[154:25.93]I think I'm going to have to do the claw.
[154:30.67]New game won't ruin your save.
[154:38.05]Let's see what happens.
[154:41.99]New game, new game, new game.
[154:43.97]I'm like scared to do this.
[154:47.12]Main menu.
[154:49.92]All progress since you started won't be saved.
[154:52.00]Okay, like new game.
[154:56.38]I'm not sure I trust this.
[155:07.11]Don't do it.
[155:12.50]I'm not.
[155:12.92]I can't.
[155:13.38]No.
[155:13.92]Alright, I'm getting a lot of don't do it's.
[155:17.32]Let's just murder ourselves.
[155:24.30]Everyone's freaking out right now.
[155:28.99]It's way too sketchy.
[155:36.12]Uh, what do you think?
[155:37.08]Should I just... that's... yeah, not... just... end it.
[155:41.60]$900 is way too much money to lose in the very beginning of this game.
[155:48.01]Check if there's a delete thing in the options.
[155:49.37]That's also a good point.
[155:53.53]There'd probably be a warning if you reset it.
[155:55.15]Yeah, uh, but that's a risky click.
[155:58.03]It is.
[156:04.59]The developer is not an idiot.
[156:10.18]I'm scared, man.
[156:15.74]Let's see.
[156:16.12]In the options, does anything exist to like... Reset all progress.
[156:20.82]Okay.
[156:24.86]I don't like this.
[156:42.15]It'll be fine.
[156:42.75]It'll be fine.
[156:54.45]It's fine.
[157:00.50]Don't, Jeremiah.
[157:01.16]Everyone's... Alright, so there is a, like, reset progress button.
[157:05.76]Right?
[157:14.34]Okay, we're good.
[157:16.20]I just saw this screen and I was like, wait, everything's gone.
[157:19.46]We're fine.
[157:19.92]Everything's fine.
[157:20.66]Okay, we're good.
[157:23.78]It started at this screen and I had a little bit of a panic attack.
[157:28.67]Saw his enemies while spinning firefly reveals and hits cloaked.
[157:32.01]That's awesome.
[157:36.91]So all is right with the world.
[157:43.49]This time, we're going to give this one a real, true attempt.
[157:50.19]And look at that.
[157:51.27]Right off the bat, we got a goldfish.
[157:53.37]Does this thing do any damage?
[157:57.20]What does this do?
[157:57.78]Gives you gold.
[158:00.00]And a bee?
[158:02.28]Chicken?
[158:04.80]No, I'm not doing a pelican again.
[158:09.18]I feel like B is safer than chicken.
[158:11.64]No, chicken's probably better.
[158:12.66]I have to pee again.
[158:13.52]What is wrong with me?
[158:17.97]I could get both.
[158:19.53]But I don't want to... I need money.
[158:21.77]I've been spending too much money.
[158:22.97]250, 150, eventually I'm going to want a queen bee.
[158:37.61]What have we got for enemies?
[158:38.43]We have stealth.
[158:39.35]Stealth, nukes, and armored planes.
[158:44.13]So... B... Mmm... This is bad.
[158:47.81]I don't know.
[158:49.46]Hold on, let me just... I'm gonna pee my pants.
[158:51.08]Why am I... Just give me a minute.
[158:53.40]Be right back.
[158:54.36]Time to pee.
[161:04.86]Okay.
[161:07.23]I'm ready.
[161:08.89]This time I was trying to do a... You know when you do a staring contest with somebody?
[161:13.17]It's like, one, two, three, go!
[161:14.33]And whoever blinks first loses.
[161:16.81]I just tried to do the equivalent of a staring contest.
[161:19.43]Thought I could do it, but I guess I'm just not strong enough.
[161:22.59]I turned on the faucet, and I was seeing if I could beat the faucet with peeing and the amount of liquid that was coming out.
[161:28.06]He's a tough opponent.
[161:29.64]I'm not sure.
[161:30.64]I'll try it again maybe later.
[161:32.80]But that's a tough cookie.
[161:38.07]Alright, have we decided what I'm gonna do here?
[161:53.52]Did I wash my hands before coming down here?
[161:55.60]No.
[161:56.75]I peed all of my hands and I like smeared it.
[162:01.09]All of the walls and my handle and I like make sure to get as much pee on the handle as I could.
[162:06.45]I'm gonna go with B.
[162:09.47]And that's final.
[162:10.69]And one other tentacle.
[162:12.05]And that's final.
[162:13.35]Because we're saving money.
[162:28.72]Not like this.
[162:29.56]I'm just messing around.
[162:31.12]What does this thing do?
[162:34.36]It just spits out a hundred dollars.
[162:37.20]How often does that happen?
[162:42.08]That thing is incredible.
[162:44.30]What if you have the two of these?
[162:47.70]Okay, no, it's not $100 every time.
[162:51.58]That's still pretty awesome.
[162:53.89]I'm going to get my entire income back.
[162:57.57]I need to play this safe, though, and not be a moron.
[163:01.21]Which is, you know, kind of hard to do for me.
[163:05.15]Have the nuke go off.
[163:06.31]Get out of the way.
[163:07.23]Do it again to this one.
[163:12.05]Block work.
[163:12.77]Good.
[163:16.21]Could I just farm it by not hitting anything?
[163:18.31]I think I get, eventually the waves get more intense, I think, to make it so you don't just dick around and farm money.
[163:27.41]You get like a nuclear wave, right?
[163:28.83]Doesn't that happen?
[163:40.37]That thing is too good.
[163:43.98]I'll put another one on.
[163:44.78]I need to activate this before it gets close enough to cause a massive problem for me.
[163:51.30]It's okay.
[163:54.29]We activated ourselves with our body and blew up the whole place, so that's fine.
[164:01.69]It's alright.
[164:02.09]That health can come back.
[164:13.47]I want you not to be stealthed, because you will hit me in the face.
[164:20.75]Three hits on a bee?
[164:22.10]That's three hits with a bee.
[164:25.00]I'm going to move out of the way, though.
[164:26.70]So they have to come a little bit longer to get me.
[164:36.70]Nukes, too.
[164:39.12]Actually, it doesn't matter.
[164:39.76]Once the building goes down, the level ends.
[164:42.72]And I've made a lot of money.
[164:46.49]So it turns out this thing is the best.
[164:49.55]Very much excited about this.
[164:52.05]That's a sad face, though.
[164:54.95]Doesn't seem to be enjoying itself.
[165:04.62]And down... Down she goes!
[165:14.76]How can we buy?
[165:15.32]Hmm.
[165:25.42]Get this fucking, get this shit out of here.
[165:29.62]Frog is probably a good idea.
[165:32.84]Frog and an extra life maybe.
[165:36.83]I'm gonna say frog, extra life.
[165:43.88]Or Tentacle Frog.
[165:45.20]But I don't think I have enough for Tentacle Frog.
[165:52.15]Two bees?
[165:53.11]Bee and frog?
[165:54.17]I mean, I could do that.
[165:56.17]Yeah, let's do that.
[166:03.94]This is fine.
[166:04.86]This is the little guys.
[166:10.01]Extra life is not super important right now.
[166:12.41]But now at least I have the damage to back my... Back my mouth up, you know what I mean?
[166:22.82]And we'll get this.
[166:25.60]Like nothing ever happened.
[166:32.71]Thank god for that.
[166:39.58]Although, a little slow.
[166:42.92]Just a little on the slow side.
[166:44.60]I have to be really prepared for when these guys come in.
[166:54.47]Oh, god damn it.
[167:00.53]Yeah, DPS is a little more to be desired right now.
[167:02.39]I need the frog to really come into play and knock out some of these little guys.
[167:10.51]For instance.
[167:15.39]Oh, that would have been bad if I grabbed him with the tongue.
[167:22.01]We're good.
[167:22.49]I just heard a... Something just got spawned?
[167:23.74]Yeah.
[167:25.52]Can I tongue the chest?
[167:26.46]No.
[167:36.02]Break it, please.
[167:39.19]Thank you.
[167:47.65]Use the frog for building DPS?
[167:49.85]Yeah, absolutely.
[167:51.51]This is kind of an awkward spot, though.
[167:55.82]I almost just blew myself up.
[167:56.82]That would be bad.
[168:00.96]What?
[168:01.14]Can I tongue the chest?
[168:02.54]Yeah, can I put my tongue in the chest?
[168:04.70]Help me?
[168:10.26]Too close.
[168:12.54]Too close for comfort.
[168:17.24]Watch out, Black Mamba's gonna spawn.
[168:18.42]Alright, I need a big thing to grab onto to slam into everybody.
[168:30.06]Okay, I'm in trouble here.
[168:36.50]Shoot it!
[168:37.18]Oh, what are you doing?
[168:38.10]Why are you not shooting?
[168:39.50]What the fuck was that?
[168:45.67]That's bad.
[168:46.96]This is bad My DPS is just way too low, but didn't really have a choice I had absolutely no choice
[169:15.21]Let's see if we can't make this a better... Oh, finally.
[169:18.03]Thank you.
[169:20.95]Get rid of one of the bees.
[169:23.25]Or the cobra.
[169:23.93]Two?
[169:24.15]Should I... I did... It's too late.
[169:30.37]I already did it.
[169:31.15]That was a stupid idea, and I got really greedy, but I did it anyways.
[169:42.00]That's worse than it was before, but it's okay.
[169:44.39]This thing's alright.
[169:45.59]I see land shots.
[169:49.53]We just got two back-to-back hearts.
[169:55.25]I actually prefer this over the bee.
[169:57.08]I'll take one of these over two bees any day.
[170:00.40]And that's not me messing around.
[170:01.80]Because I can actually aim these.
[170:17.12]Make it happen, get it, make it happen!
[170:18.46]I think we're good.
[170:29.14]Can I get some money now?
[170:37.11]I can only do one thing of damage here.
[170:39.29]I don't need to have no pluses, no.
[170:42.83]I actually am at the mercy of where he moves.
[170:45.55]Because these fish don't do anything.
[170:49.90]This is not good.
[170:51.22]I have one damage dealer and a frog.
[170:54.08]Alright, get me right in his eye.
[170:55.68]Okay.
[170:55.90]This is going to take a while, but... How come these things aren't printing money for me?
[171:03.40]Where's my money?
[171:05.72]Don't look at me with that sad face.
[171:07.26]Print shit out some money.
[171:17.37]Why are they not giving me any money?
[171:21.75]This doesn't seem right.
[171:22.53]Is it because it's a boss?
[171:29.61]I can grab a plane, I think, here, coming up.
[171:36.29]Which I can then slam into the butcher's head, which... Sweet.
[171:49.72]The money well has certainly dried up.
[171:51.54]Maybe they don't do it during bosses, which makes my purchase kind of useless, but whatever.
[172:07.00]Be careful not to get too close to this dude, man.
[172:09.22]Don't want to get hit by the meat tenderizer.
[172:17.86]Phase three, hit him with planes.
[172:23.30]Actually, I need to use this for other purposes.
[172:34.25]Grab it.
[172:36.75]Fucking hell, come on.
[172:37.75]Really?
[172:39.69]Bounced off the top.
[172:40.96]Now I'm not in range anymore.
[172:44.50]Come on, grab him.
[172:51.29]Here, easy!
[172:53.50]Easy!
[172:56.58]Whatever.
[172:59.02]Easy!
[173:00.34]That's not coming down, right?
[173:03.70]That's not coming down, right?
[173:10.52]Um, no, I'm disappointed by the two goldfish.
[173:12.41]I'm not happy about that.
[173:17.59]I'm very sad about that latest development.
[173:30.22]Because I want my money back on those things.
[173:39.66]Not as happy as he spits out 100.
[173:40.96]Yeah, where was that the whole time?
[173:50.13]Just took unnecessary fucking damage here.
[173:52.09]Because that's slow as shit.
[173:54.71]Two useless fucking goldfish.
[173:56.55]I got $100 in an entire level.
[174:00.12]Well, give me a break.
[174:14.93]Sorry.
[174:16.01]I got a little swimmy-timmy here to make sure I get some gold jewels.
[174:24.54]That's just fun to do.
[174:26.18]That's just fun to do.
[174:27.06]That's why I'm doing it.
[174:29.33]It actually freezes the shells too, that's cool.
[174:40.41]Good.
[174:43.97]I like this music.
[174:47.81]That hit me?
[174:48.25]Really?
[174:49.78]I'm surprised by that.
[174:51.74]Not much surprises me anymore.
[174:57.28]Can we revive Krunk?
[175:00.29]I have nothing to do with Kronk.
[175:06.09]We already talked about this.
[175:07.13]Emperor's New Groove has nothing to do with my YouTube and Twitch channels.
[175:16.86]Well, that turned out to be a bad idea.
[175:18.68]Because now I froze those in place.
[175:24.56]Oh, I don't care.
[175:26.84]We're going for a 100% shell collection raid here.
[175:36.12]Damn it.
[175:37.79]Hmm.
[175:38.73]We're going for a 90% shell collection right here.
[175:40.89]90%.
[175:40.91]Oh, sorry.
[175:41.43]Ugh.
[176:05.78]One hundo.
[176:10.16]Hmm.
[176:14.98]This is all bad, too.
[176:15.90]Gotta get the eel.
[176:19.17]Uh... Shit.
[176:28.97]No, no pelican.
[176:31.83]No pelican.
[176:39.27]Tentacle and... the eel.
[176:48.93]Ayayay, it's alright.
[176:58.65]Save the queen bee?
[176:59.85]Yeah, but I need to be able to hurt things.
[177:03.19]There's too many, uh, this game, I like this game.
[177:05.89]You know why?
[177:06.39]Because there's so many mistakes to make.
[177:08.78]Look at it!
[177:09.14]They're already giving me more money than before.
[177:10.62]They're spitting out, it just can't be on a boss level.
[177:20.10]That's good to know, actually.
[177:21.04]It's alright, I got the frog, I'll be alright.
[177:31.53]Please.
[177:33.90]Thank you.
[177:37.00]It's based off of enemies killed.
[177:38.82]That's interesting.
[177:39.58]I'm going for it.
[177:50.67]You know, that would have worked fucking great.
[177:54.59]It still worked out.
[178:00.82]Here comes the return on investment.
[178:02.28]That's what I'm talking about.
[178:13.47]Ooh, that was slick!
[178:14.41]Give me more enemies.
[178:19.98]So I can fucking slick wreck them.
[178:44.43]beautiful uh I want to get hits on this I just smash that and get it all 1100 I am so addicted I think I'm just gonna no no cobra two cobras maybe or should I just hold it
[179:11.82]I think holding might be a bad idea here.
[179:13.70]I need more damage.
[179:14.51]I have to have more consistent damage.
[179:20.91]All I really have is the snake.
[179:23.11]A tier 2 cobra.
[179:30.65]One black mamba and seven goldfish.
[179:33.26]I wish.
[179:35.34]Crab claw won't be bad, but... Hmm...
[179:48.08]Stealthed enemies in these guys.
[179:50.02]Okay.
[179:50.52]Here's the thing though.
[179:52.00]There's a lot of little guys on this next round.
[179:59.34]Fuck it.
[179:59.80]Save money.
[180:04.60]Let's get a land shots.
[180:06.29]I do have the parallelization though.
[180:10.29]Just land shots and make it be alright.
[180:12.49]You just have to be good at the game.
[180:18.17]Frog to the big tanks.
[180:22.54]And I can bring everybody out of stealth if I electrocute them.
[180:29.86]Oh my god, that... Why?
[180:31.33]I was shifting back and forth.
[180:33.25]I was going like this and it must have accidentally triggered the fact that it was left-click and right-click at the same time!
[180:49.28]See, I was doing this and it must have triggered left... Whatever.
[180:52.42]You know what I said.
[181:07.26]He didn't take his tongue out!
[181:08.50]It's quiet.
[181:14.86]I have to, come on, just like, think of it like you're playing a first person shooter video game.
[181:30.49]Alright, don't worry.
[181:35.78]I have a electrocution device.
[181:38.22]I'm not afraid to use it.
[181:48.19]Watch this, ready?
[181:49.07]One, two, action!
[181:53.59]Only one hard, one hard lift.
[182:05.47]I just did that so much that I just burnt my hands.
[182:08.81]I got too excited very quickly there.
[182:12.67]Queen bee.
[182:14.65]I just, I burnt my hands.
[182:17.98]Alright, this is Megapede coming up here.
[182:20.46]Lots of little guys.
[182:24.54]Let's see what Queen Bee does.
[182:26.07]I'm excited.
[182:27.31]That's what you get for having patience and saving your money.
[182:40.20]It shoots two.
[182:40.96]That's awesome.
[182:42.74]That's so much better.
[182:53.55]It's just having two bees as one bee.
[183:02.29]Especially for the little guys that float around.
[183:05.88]That's pretty good.
[183:12.46]I keep freaking out.
[183:13.06]I keep thinking the tadpole is an enemy.
[183:15.32]And I don't like it.
[183:19.78]I wish I could put those in the background or something.
[183:29.07]Large enemies approaching.
[183:30.05]This would be pretty easy with the bee.
[183:34.21]Even if it breaks off into sections, it should be perfectly fine.
[183:37.35]I actually might not have any problems at all.
[183:44.56]If I don't hit the middle section, then I'll be fine.
[183:53.19]Watch out.
[183:53.61]The toad is still holding on to the thing.
[183:58.00]I wanna, like, get rid of that shit.
[184:00.84]I'm kinda getting wrapped up here.
[184:03.78]This might not be good.
[184:05.12]Should I not do this one section at a time?
[184:06.94]I don't think I've ever done it before.
[184:08.98]Just doing it head at a time.
[184:13.62]Could eat the heads, right?
[184:14.74]Yeah, I can.
[184:25.48]Head works.
[184:26.50]Frog works pretty good too.
[184:32.61]Frog head, come on.
[184:34.69]You stupid asshole.
[184:39.97]Jesus Christ all fucking mighty in heaven hallowed be thy name.
[184:43.05]Thy kingdom fucking come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
[184:45.83]And give us this day this daily bread.
[184:47.05]And don't trespass into anybody's quarters.
[184:48.91]And don't fucking break into their house and steal their PlayStation 3.
[185:03.13]That's three goldfishes.
[185:16.81]What do I replace?
[185:24.53]Goddamn all the repressed anger.
[185:27.57]Somebody broke into my house a long time ago.
[185:32.38]I wonder if I should just do three goldfish and... No, that was $800.
[185:37.14]I could do cobra instead of a goldfish, but I could also do goldfish instead of frog.
[185:54.37]And end up with lots of money.
[186:01.39]I don't know what to do here.
[186:02.85]There's a lot of bad decisions I can make.
[186:13.17]Goldfish instead of snake.
[186:14.23]What's coming up next?
[186:19.70]I don't even know what the fuck this is.
[186:22.54]Got bullets coming up.
[186:24.48]Invisible planes.
[186:31.63]I'm just gonna hold on.
[186:37.38]Try to hold on to some money.
[186:40.74]I should be alright here, as long as I can aim.
[186:42.84]Which, who knows if that's gonna be a possibility or not, right?
[186:50.39]Those are quick.
[186:51.07]Okay.
[186:51.95]I might be in a... I just saved myself a hit there.
[186:58.45]Hmm... This is not good.
[187:03.71]A lot of fast planes in this level.
[187:12.56]Come on, get over here.
[187:22.68]Queen Bee works pretty well for those guys flying around, but not the fast ones.
[187:28.00]No, I'm just so far.
[187:29.22]Okay, I'm getting rid of the goldfish gone.
[187:33.48]We got our queen bee early game.
[187:35.30]I'm not throwing this whole game in the trash because I have two people that do damage.
[187:47.55]Just come to me.
[187:53.24]I don't want to make a garbage can run if I don't have to.
[188:05.31]Frog is useless here.
[188:06.41]Alright.
[188:16.29]Go on.
[188:19.68]We really do need the Black Mamba.
[188:23.90]Once you get Black Mamba, I bet you it's just a rapid-fire machine gun.
[188:28.82]I bet you it's just total, utter destruction.
[188:32.60]That's right, utter destruction.
[188:37.86]Just hang out here for a sec.
[188:43.26]God damn it.
[188:45.58]You know, it hurts that the goldfish are in the worst possible place, too.
[188:51.96]Because there's never a scenario where I need to have damage there.
[188:59.45]They need to be either together or not there at all.
[189:09.28]Just otter destruction.
[189:14.32]What do we got?
[189:24.73]Yeah.
[189:26.31]That's what we want to do.
[189:36.93]Keep the frog.
[189:40.61]Let's get the snail, maybe.
[189:42.05]Yeah, let's just get it, just to have it.
[189:46.31]Two queen bees.
[189:49.91]Wrong place?
[189:50.43]No, I want them there.
[189:51.17]Because I want them just to be firing at the same time into the air.
[189:56.13]I want four bullets to go in the air at the same time.
[190:00.02]I think this might be an opportunity to replace goldfish here as well.
[190:03.92]With... Crab claw.
[190:10.39]Maybe, you know, I might be able to get through one more level with the extra money.
[190:14.77]And then at the boss, we're going to get rid of Goldfish.
[190:18.91]But I could, this could be very bad.
[190:21.09]I might have just ruined everything.
[190:22.87]But I think if I just, as long as I keep them up in the air, that I will have plenty of time to get out.
[190:34.82]I didn't even see him.
[190:35.80]I didn't even... God, he's cloaked.
[190:37.48]He was cloaked and I didn't... Of course he is.
[190:39.42]He's a cloaked enemy.
[190:40.26]I didn't even see him on the screen.
[190:41.42]God, I wish I could speak another language.
[190:45.50]Because there would be so many opportunities for me to just be mad in another language.
[190:50.60]I don't want to learn another language for any other reason than to just start speaking it when I'm angry.
[190:59.91]I needed to use that.
[191:05.62]Some people want to learn for, oh, well, you know, I kind of want to, like, learn everything I can about the world.
[191:11.28]Not really.
[191:11.70]This thing, we need to get out of here.
[191:16.04]You're really just fucking this up for me, you stupid globe.
[191:24.29]Come on!
[191:26.75]You're making me get spawned on.
[191:40.73]They'll get taken care of.
[191:45.97]And also, you get to, like, talk shit about people when they're in front of you.
[191:55.24]You know, it's like, if you can speak another language and you really want to, like, just talk about somebody, like, right in front of them, you can.
[192:01.08]They have no idea what the hell you're saying.
[192:06.32]And... That's how we're gonna deal with that.
[192:16.17]Take it down.
[192:24.83]Stealth planes here.
[192:26.30]Don't get cocky.
[192:41.52]What if I actually understand and confront you about it?
[192:45.07]Well, that's a risk I'm willing to take.
[192:50.72]Is it time for goldfish?
[192:51.60]Yeah, goldfish is getting out of here because we don't.
[192:54.22]We're at a boss.
[192:56.18]So we've made a lot of money.
[192:59.00]I think I want to do double cobras on this side and... No, I don't want to do more bees.
[193:05.13]We already did the bee thing.
[193:06.47]Or a tentacle.
[193:11.15]It's either gonna be save, tentacle, or a cobra instead of the goldfish.
[193:19.29]Probably should put this here though.
[193:23.30]Split these guys up a little bit.
[193:31.05]That's what I'm doing.
[193:33.69]And the kangaroo.
[193:42.03]Don't space the bees.
[193:42.84]Well, I want to space the bees because I saw like two or three opportunities there where they need to be shooting in different directions.
[193:53.99]I'm going to use it right now just because that was an opportunity that I was in a lot of trouble.
[194:06.16]That's better.
[194:14.28]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!
[194:17.46]Somebody get him!
[194:20.41]Watch out for that thing!
[194:21.61]Watch it!
[194:23.57]I couldn't go anywhere.
[194:24.43]I was bound to just get hit by that fucking thing.
[194:26.13]The stealth... I desperately, desperately, desperately, desperately want to unlock the stealth that shoots.
[194:34.04]The stealth identifier that shoots the weapon.
[194:37.54]Those are a pain in my asshole.
[194:39.60]Big time.
[194:47.44]Alright, now we just go like this.
[195:09.07]What's the fish?
[195:09.89]The fish just generates money.
[195:11.83]Depending on how many enemies you kill.
[195:13.64]Actually, I want to be shooting from this side.
[195:17.39]If I can make it.
[195:18.29]Yeah.
[195:19.41]Yeah, I know.
[195:25.00]Just be easy.
[195:25.96]You want to split the bees now?
[195:36.71]Yes.
[195:37.83]It's not a big deal.
[195:40.01]But this is.
[195:40.57]You have to jump.
[195:44.19]For the boss, yeah, but for an actual general fight, I had to split them.
[195:49.91]They weren't working out so well together, because I was rolling on top of them every time.
[195:59.30]Okay, we've got to split bee soup.
[196:00.50]It's fine.
[196:06.23]Well, I was so convinced that that stupid little kangaroo was going to hit me that I just gave up.
[196:14.06]And you know what?
[196:14.54]He is.
[196:15.04]And why am I not grabbing him?
[196:16.94]Why am I not grabbing that guy?
[196:18.62]Have I lost my fucking mind?
[196:41.14]Alright.
[196:41.60]Kill it.
[196:59.47]I will beat you with your own child.
[197:01.28]That's actually pretty morbid.
[197:02.68]Now that I think about it.
[197:09.74]Here we go.
[197:10.64]Bonus!
[197:11.04]No, already got hit.
[197:20.20]Shit!
[197:23.68]I would've got hit twice, wouldn't I, right there?
[197:28.19]Interesting spread to start this.
[197:35.19]No 100% here.
[197:35.69]Dang it.
[197:55.51]Here come the rockets.
[197:57.75]Let's just use this now.
[197:59.17]Because we have a charge.
[198:00.52]I'm missing a lot, actually.
[198:03.44]I haven't really been in the best placement to do it, though.
[198:10.80]What are the shells for?
[198:13.64]The shells are for the permanent upgrades in the game.
[198:16.97]So, when you die, inevitably, however far you get,
[198:20.87]You go back to the very beginning and you get shells to spend on upgrades.
[198:25.19]Hey, what's DNA?
[198:28.53]Damn it.
[198:34.25]Are we underground again?
[198:35.36]I feel like this should be going.
[198:39.78]I don't know.
[198:40.16]I feel like it's Lobsterclaw for the snake.
[198:51.80]no king cobra though either lobster is switching with the fish or lobster for the snake it's more stealth in these stupid things burn the goldfish I think I want to keep the goldfish like for as long as I can
[199:21.51]Yeah, I'll replace the snake.
[199:25.67]Because then, this is a good building killer.
[199:28.99]Eventually, when I get out there.
[199:35.92]You don't need the claw?
[199:36.80]Well, I mean, the default snake wasn't really doing anything for me anyways.
[199:49.40]God damn it, man.
[199:51.50]Ugh.
[199:54.65]I'm... Whatever.
[199:56.21]Fucking stealth.
[200:01.39]You know, like, alright.
[200:03.01]Those of you that are gonna buy this game, as soon as you possibly can, get the upgrade that lets you see through stealth and shoot.
[200:10.97]Do it as soon as you can.
[200:12.85]Because, like, 20-20 hindsight, I wish I had that right now on every single character.
[200:18.27]Bad.
[200:23.80]That's turning out to look like it's one of the things that I have to have.
[200:27.29]Because it fucks me every time.
[200:34.87]Pro tip!
[200:35.47]Make sure you download these pro tips!
[200:47.26]Sponsored upgrade.
[200:48.84]Alright, I gotta do this right.
[200:50.38]I have a charge.
[200:51.94]Let's make sure I do it correctly.
[200:58.36]and pro tip always wait what are you saying what gross what are we what are we replacing here um
[201:26.04]Queen B in front of the claw and just aim it in the air instead of the goldfish to have it in every direction.
[201:33.24]We could just, but then if they're on the other side, that's total pain.
[201:52.94]This is the safe play.
[201:56.17]We're gonna go with the safe one.
[201:57.57]Because then it's every direction, I don't have to worry about it.
[202:02.46]That's what we're gonna do for now.
[202:03.44]What do we got?
[202:06.10]That's fine.
[202:07.32]These will be blown up by the bees.
[202:17.97]Yeah.
[202:18.35]Got rid of the goldfish.
[202:19.61]Served me well, apparently, because... allowed me to upgrade everything.
[202:33.17]So, very nice job.
[202:36.93]Thank you, Goldfish.
[202:40.71]You did Daddy proud.
[202:48.35]Looks like it may have been the right call.
[202:50.17]Especially in the water levels, at least.
[202:52.77]At the very least, right?
[202:57.30]Somebody get that guy, please.
[202:58.68]Thank God.
[203:02.19]Spinning Wheel of Death.
[203:06.15]I think we're gonna use it here, maybe?
[203:14.29]Stay on top of it.
[203:24.90]Damn it.
[203:25.74]That was close.
[203:29.22]Oh boy.
[203:29.74]Alright, calm down.
[203:33.84]What have we got?
[203:49.29]Yes!
[203:53.31]Happy!
[204:02.57]Angler for, um... Claw.
[204:06.57]But we're on land now, though.
[204:08.24]Yeah, no, I have to.
[204:12.54]I'm placing the claw with an angler.
[204:19.54]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[204:20.16]What do we got next?
[204:21.04]Yeah, we have stealth coming up here.
[204:26.00]Save the rest of the money.
[204:35.09]Still in the ocean?
[204:35.79]Yeah, so I don't need the claw right now.
[204:39.39]It's been way more important to make sure these can be targeted.
[204:44.10]Saves me a huge headache.
[204:45.24]I'm going to aim at them right when they come in front of my face.
[204:53.18]I already am happy about this.
[205:13.28]Track him.
[205:14.06]Get that chest, man!
[205:19.78]And we're done.
[205:21.30]Just like that.
[205:23.52]All bees and angler actually might be pretty great.
[205:27.24]At least for the water levels.
[205:29.06]Can't say the same thing for anything else.
[205:38.33]But bees are certainly, certainly effective in the water levels.
[205:46.75]I almost just fucking got hit there.
[205:49.61]That would have not been making me happy.
[205:58.52]Why's my monitor blinking?
[206:01.98]Hey, stop that.
[206:04.20]Okay, that was weird.
[206:06.18]Honest to fucking god.
[206:08.44]You piece of shit monitor.
[206:12.32]Dumb fucking monitor.
[206:14.33]You garbage bin Walmart brand fucking monitor.
[206:17.63]And that's not even what it is.
[206:30.37]Pain in the ass.
[206:30.97]Why?
[206:31.26]I think, is this extra life or should I just keep holding on?
[206:40.60]It's going up every time.
[206:44.08]Coral.
[206:47.47]Coral and save.
[206:49.25]What's coming up next?
[206:50.13]No stealth.
[206:51.79]No stealth.
[206:53.45]This is no stealth here.
[206:56.25]We might have to do with another bee.
[206:58.98]Or a penguin.
[206:59.60]We're going to do bee.
[207:09.79]We're going to do bee.
[207:12.50]Save it?
[207:13.14]Oh, that's... Yeah, but I might need it.
[207:15.46]Oh, don't get... That's already not moved.
[207:22.84]Keep the Angler.
[207:24.86]You know, that... You're right.
[207:26.08]You're right.
[207:26.72]When you're right, you're right.
[207:27.34]You guys are right.
[207:36.02]I'm willing to admit when somebody's right.
[207:38.13]And you guys are right.
[207:47.98]Grab him, smash.
[207:55.08]I'm so glad there's no stealth.
[207:56.40]It makes it so much easier.
[208:02.79]Let's grab you with the tongue.
[208:09.71]Come on.
[208:11.37]Don't be shy.
[208:16.88]I feel a little more confident on this run than I did the last one.
[208:19.94]And that's including the amount of lives I have.
[208:23.54]Even though I never bought an extra life, but I think it's fine.
[208:38.61]Nuke's coming in.
[208:40.97]Don't even need to aim.
[208:42.27]Don't even need to pay attention to where they are.
[208:45.10]That's my favorite kind of gameplay.
[208:47.04]When the game plays itself.
[208:48.06]Grab you.
[208:57.15]Ooh, maximum range.
[208:58.27]That feels good.
[208:59.19]Oddly satisfying.
[209:00.07]Oddly satisfying!
[209:07.19]Might be time to utilize my electrostatic.
[209:23.52]Might as well.
[209:25.55]We're at the very end.
[209:37.54]Last guy.
[209:38.26]Take it down.
[209:48.20]Come on, man.
[209:49.28]Get rid of it.
[209:54.41]Not making this easy on me, please.
[209:55.63]I don't want to take a hit of damage here.
[209:57.31]Thank you.
[210:04.12]What does the Angler do?
[210:05.58]Whatever the Angler is looking at cannot be stealthed.
[210:12.94]I'm going to go for the extra life here.
[210:16.60]I feel like this is an opportunity to get it, because this is all trash.
[210:19.46]Except the starfish is good, but I have... I'm doing the extra life.
[210:24.78]Everyone's telling me to save, but this is one of the last opportunities I'm going to be able to buy an extra life.
[210:28.25]The mamba... We got like seven... We got to get seven, eight thousand dollars for a mamba.
[210:45.27]starfish and eel will stack yeah I know they stack but I did it I got it alright what's coming up no stealth these are both garbage though it's alright let's go okay I'm addicted to spending money I'm sorry
[211:16.59]I can't help it.
[211:20.87]Listen to the one guy in chat saying to get the starfish.
[211:29.58]You know, you might be right.
[211:30.92]One guy probably said that.
[211:33.46]That guy's probably real happy that I bought the thing he said to buy.
[211:36.47]Right?
[211:36.71]He's probably like, oh, nice.
[211:37.63]He got the starfish.
[211:38.41]I said that.
[211:41.33]Look, I have double whammy.
[211:43.03]Everything's going to be fine.
[211:44.57]I got the Darth Vader ship.
[211:46.61]And smash it into the building.
[211:58.25]One guy said... It wasn't one guy, come on.
[212:01.53]It was like four of you, at least.
[212:04.47]How many people were here?
[212:06.23]Like 2300 people?
[212:07.07]Like four of you said to get the starfish.
[212:09.48]What percentage is that?
[212:11.34]Like 0.2%?
[212:11.56]That's pretty large.
[212:19.48]It was one guy.
[212:20.67]Yeah, but what about the people in the chat that aren't talking?
[212:25.15]They might have wanted it.
[212:27.39]Speaking of which, I'm using it now.
[212:29.29]Because those things are going to be a pain in my ass.
[212:33.29]See?
[212:33.73]Look, I just used it.
[212:34.57]How cool was that?
[212:35.45]It did both special moves at the same time.
[212:45.61]That makes me so happy that it was one person.
[212:53.26]Those little shits.
[212:57.18]The starfish hits five enemies.
[212:59.42]I believe he kills five enemies.
[213:01.38]He goes one, two, three, four, five.
[213:04.94]They'll be recharged by the time I get to the huge wave.
[213:12.28]And we'll be golden.
[213:14.61]Huge wave, recharged.
[213:20.97]Just need to get the right opportunity to use it.
[213:23.35]Back it up.
[213:25.43]And it looks like that opportunity is... Now.
[213:31.90]Excuse me.
[213:34.78]It's been real.
[213:42.70]Frog this guy, man.
[213:43.34]What are you thinking?
[213:51.23]Watch the back.
[213:51.93]Make sure nobody collapses.
[213:53.45]I've been really into that word, huh?
[213:54.81]He's going to collapse on me.
[213:56.11]I'll do a collapsed on here.
[213:57.63]Am I learning new vocabulary today?
[214:04.72]I cannot move the mouse off the screen.
[214:07.04]It's not possible.
[214:09.34]It's just part of the game.
[214:12.40]We are just saving money.
[214:13.82]There's nothing I want to buy here.
[214:16.45]No stealth, but I mean... Look, this has been the third time in a row with no stealth.
[214:23.03]But who cares?
[214:23.63]It's an educational stream.
[214:31.05]Disable mouse capture.
[214:33.69]But then I can't see what I'm clicking on.
[214:36.73]Hold on.
[214:48.81]It's in OBS somewhere.
[214:49.65]Where the hell is it?
[214:57.54]Settings.
[214:58.92]Watch me accidentally turn off the stream.
[215:02.14]Oh, is it video?
[215:03.84]I don't even know.
[215:04.36]I've never turned it off before, so where the hell is it even?
[215:12.16]Just change it to the huge size.
[215:14.66]One guy said it.
[215:17.42]That's how this works, guys.
[215:20.20]One person tells me to do something, and I do it.
[215:31.73]I don't even know where this is.
[215:36.13]Scene settings.
[215:39.62]Alright, general.
[215:41.04]This is gonna restart OBS.
[215:47.02]Output video advanced Okay, hold on I Don't know where it is, I think I can't find it anywhere I
[216:15.53]It's in the capture source.
[216:16.65]I mean, I'm doing game capture right now.
[216:25.97]Limit capture frame rate.
[216:27.57]I don't see it anywhere.
[216:28.29]Whoops.
[216:32.83]Oh God, what did I do?
[216:33.81]I just like fucking broke it.
[216:41.10]You can't even like see it now.
[216:45.28]one guy says the cursor and I like up the whole stream I got it I got it I got it there it is there you go for that one guy right oh no we're good
[217:14.60]Hey, ah, ah, what do you think?
[217:17.45]And?
[217:17.63]Huh?
[217:21.33]Take a look at this.
[217:30.82]I figured it out.
[217:40.30]I love how someone just wrote, dude, I can't see the bad joke.
[217:44.06]That wasn't a joke.
[217:44.66]I was actually, I actually turned it off.
[217:46.52]It's off.
[217:46.92]It's not on the screen anymore.
[217:47.97]What do you mean bad joke?
[217:50.61]Me turning a feature off of OBS is not a joke.
[217:52.75]It's me turning a feature off to make sure that I have the best stream environment for my viewers.
[217:56.39]You know, the one viewer that said to do that.
[218:00.91]I care about that guy.
[218:02.33]See, some streamers might not care about the individual.
[218:05.55]Just a bunch of numbers to a lot of people, right?
[218:07.91]Not me.
[218:09.33]You ask me to get the starfish, one guy?
[218:10.91]I'm gonna get the starfish.
[218:12.13]You say, ah, that is bothering me, that cursor on the... One guy?
[218:17.28]I'm a man of the people, of the man, the solo.
[218:22.08]I'm gonna take care of you.
[218:37.39]Just to please one guy.
[218:38.69]Yeah, but hey, here's the thing.
[218:39.77]There's something that you're not understanding.
[218:42.22]What if one day you might be that one guy, right?
[218:46.08]One day, you might be hanging out in this stream, and you might have a suggestion.
[218:50.02]You might say something.
[218:50.86]You might be the one guy in chat that's saying it.
[218:52.98]You're gonna be that guy one day, and I'm gonna listen to you.
[218:58.41]Right?
[219:09.21]I'm going to use... What's the play here?
[219:12.91]Can I just shoot underneath and just not take any damage?
[219:17.07]I wonder.
[219:17.36]I'm going to try my fucked up philosophy.
[219:22.30]It works.
[219:23.60]Not that well.
[219:24.62]Yeah, it works.
[219:31.59]Let's just get under there.
[219:39.53]Can I get?
[219:40.03]Yeah, I can get two.
[219:40.93]Yeah, I can.
[219:43.46]Don't get greedy.
[219:44.10]I only have three hearts, so don't make this harder than it needs to be.
[219:51.72]Don't go in there.
[219:53.98]Utilize your homing technology.
[219:57.98]And then slide.
[219:59.08]You know what I mean?
[219:59.70]Slide into those DMs.
[220:00.64]You know what I mean?
[220:01.80]Slide into those DMs.
[220:04.96]Hey, what's up?
[220:06.52]How you doing?
[220:09.10]Oh, shit.
[220:09.72]Oh, shit.
[220:10.06]Abort.
[220:10.52]Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort.
[220:22.48]And... Junkie!
[220:29.53]He's actually not hitting him.
[220:34.64]bad meme I'm just I'm not actually making that reference I'm just saying it I'm just making the reference to not make the reference understand I'm not making that reference I'm making the reference that I'm not making that reference because I don't like that reference so ironic such an ironic guy I'm doing it for like just the sheer irony you know
[221:05.64]Okay, Jerma, calm down.
[221:11.88]Can we use that as an excuse when we make bad jokes?
[221:17.06]Look, I made one guy laugh with that one.
[221:24.45]That's funny.
[221:31.90]Get out.
[221:40.29]I was just staring at the chat.
[221:41.75]I wasn't even looking at the game, and I somehow miraculously did not get hit by any missiles.
[221:47.39]I was just waiting patiently for my opportunity to go in.
[221:53.41]Get big frog, come on.
[221:54.41]This is my opportunity to do some damage with this.
[221:55.91]I'm in trouble.
[222:02.63]Yep, I'm in deep shit.
[222:03.59]Get out.
[222:05.05]Ah, you idiot.
[222:06.25]It's alright.
[222:06.69]I got too focused on the greedy frog.
[222:13.40]We'll die in this next go about here.
[222:23.09]Come on, really?
[222:23.83]Come on, right there.
[222:29.98]Right in the head.
[222:35.12]I'm not getting any great... You have to put it right in front of it every time.
[222:38.93]And you have to shoot every time right there.
[222:46.48]Annoying.
[222:48.94]Lift up your leg.
[222:49.60]Come on.
[222:53.72]Give me an opportunity to get in there.
[222:58.99]Oh, come on.
[222:59.89]What is with this?
[223:07.87]Just die.
[223:10.43]How long is this streak?
[223:13.97]Yeah, that's a good point.
[223:15.53]I didn't even think about that.
[223:20.63]Whack whack.
[223:22.68]This is the run.
[223:23.58]We're going to get to the end.
[223:24.58]We're going to get to the last boss of Insane Aquarium, Octopus Edition.
[223:32.66]Octopus.
[223:35.16]I can't say the word.
[223:36.24]Octopus.
[223:37.16]Octopus.
[223:45.33]The only thing that can sustain me is canned bread.
[223:50.93]What the hell is canned bread?
[223:52.21]They put bread in cans?
[223:57.08]What does it taste like?
[224:02.88]What about the light gun games?
[224:03.86]That's happening on Tuesday.
[224:06.62]I... I guess didn't realize to play PlayStation 1 with a light gun and actually have it work
[224:15.85]I need a CRT TV.
[224:18.09]I need like an old tube TV to get it to work.
[224:21.33]So there's a lot of weird technical troubleshooting I have to do with that.
[224:24.12]I have to get a TV that's big enough for me to even aim a gun at it and shoot it.
[224:30.52]Let alone capturing that like I did the SEGA CD.
[224:33.16]That's going to be kind of more than I thought it was going to be.
[224:36.83]But that's all good.
[224:37.51]Don't worry.
[224:38.03]You'll see it.
[224:43.90]CRT in 2018.
[224:45.00]Ah, yeah It's gonna be a huge heavy Mess it's gonna be so hard to get into this room If I wanted CRT TV, that's like bigger than 30 inches like you understand how hard that's gonna be to get in here That's gonna be like 400 pounds
[225:14.89]What am I gonna do?
[225:15.63]You know?
[225:17.63]I bought all this shit.
[225:18.65]Alright, I'm gonna ease up here.
[225:35.93]Come on, man.
[225:36.49]Don't do this.
[225:41.97]Wow, that was new.
[225:49.59]Here's 36.
[225:51.71]What do you got?
[225:53.07]Hmm.
[225:55.33]Well, we can replace... We'll replace this, because that's just... I need it.
[226:02.94]Here comes some stealth.
[226:04.20]Bees are unbelievable underwater, so we have nothing to worry about here.
[226:10.84]There are stealth enemies, though.
[226:15.08]CRTs are heavy as shit.
[226:16.28]Yeah, that's a problem.
[226:19.44]And I need to somehow set it up where you guys can see what I'm doing.
[226:22.53]Because here's the problem with old light gun games.
[226:26.59]I don't know if any of you guys remember ever playing them.
[226:29.41]Maybe some of you guys are too young.
[226:31.65]Look at that, baby.
[226:32.85]I'll take the fucking 200 shells.
[226:37.10]But the issue is... When you shoot a light gun...
[226:42.49]the screen flashes white.
[226:45.15]Like a picture was just taken.
[226:46.91]Every time.
[226:48.53]So I need to figure out a way.
[226:49.56]I think I'm going to end up just capturing me playing the game with a webcam.
[226:55.46]Because that's going to be painful for a lot of people.
[227:00.43]So I'm thinking of a situation where I can set that up so it's not going to give people a brain aneurysm watching the stream.
[227:13.76]So my theory is if it's being capped through a webcam, but the audio, the audio is going to be clean audio, because I'm going to pull it through OBS with a capture device, right?
[227:26.01]The theory is you'll get clean audio and a good picture, and we'll just kind of hang out, IRL stream, light gun.
[227:32.75]You know what's funny?
[227:33.73]Every time I do an IRL stream, I break something.
[227:35.41]So maybe I'll smash the TV, right?
[227:39.24]Maybe I'll get, like, angry and, like, throw the light gun into the CRT TV and, like, it'll explode.
[227:43.82]You never know what you're gonna get out of a fucking Jerma stream, am I right, guys?
[227:49.20]I really shouldn't have just said that.
[227:54.13]Run the feed through a low-pass filter, the goofy setup.
[227:56.53]Yeah, that's another thing, too.
[227:57.49]I could, like, mess with the settings.
[228:07.05]Ugh.
[228:12.73]What is it?
[228:13.58]What do you think?
[228:15.82]Got more stealth.
[228:16.76]Should I replace the frog with a queen bee?
[228:21.08]I'm tempted to do it.
[228:26.47]No, I'm not going to smash the TV, guys.
[228:29.03]I promise.
[228:30.75]Extra life or another bee instead of... I think this actually would have a pretty clean setup here.
[228:35.64]I'm not going to ruin a good run.
[228:38.08]I'm buying that.
[228:40.08]This is a great setup, I'm not going to fuck it up.
[228:44.46]We're too far at this point.
[228:53.63]This is going so exceptionally well here, especially underwater, why would I give myself a chance to ruin it?
[228:59.85]Got the frogs, pretty clean bees, got an angler, and a rapid fire fish.
[229:05.97]This is like one of those... Okay, I just got all the Guppy's tails.
[229:11.31]What do you need?
[229:12.99]I got Guppy's eyeball, Guppy's cat litter, and Guppy's brain, right?
[229:20.04]And now I turn into Guppy and I'm unstoppable.
[229:21.86]We're just cleaning through this.
[229:33.12]I might want to use the ability here.
[229:37.24]Yes.
[229:40.24]Look at that.
[229:40.62]Holy shit.
[229:41.46]That's a lot of shells.
[229:43.42]I have so many now.
[229:44.88]Now I can't wait to go upgrade.
[229:45.94]I'm just going to suicide now and just upgrade.
[229:50.14]Who cares about this front?
[229:50.90]I have 750 shells.
[229:55.66]I'm just kidding.
[229:57.12]That was a joke.
[230:01.09]Nice.
[230:01.87]I'm happy about that.
[230:06.16]I still haven't died one time, and I still have half hearts.
[230:08.36]And I still have a brain cap that has one or two hits on it still.
[230:19.44]Alright, looking good.
[230:22.68]Grab this dude.
[230:26.14]Perfect.
[230:27.46]Alright.
[230:31.10]And I get the brain cap back when I respawn.
[230:33.60]That's true.
[230:34.00]That's a good way to put it.
[230:48.54]Is it worth replacing?
[230:49.86]I don't think it is.
[230:57.28]Rooster over the cobra.
[230:58.34]I'm not sure.
[230:58.86]This is a lot more accurate.
[231:01.34]It helps.
[231:01.99]Maybe.
[231:04.77]No.
[231:05.29]Yeah.
[231:06.93]Let me just... No.
[231:08.31]Yeah.
[231:09.49]There's too much stealth here to remove him.
[231:14.19]I could just get another tentacle too.
[231:15.51]Yeah, I'm gonna save.
[231:16.63]Not worth it.
[231:22.75]This is going way too well.
[231:25.07]Far too many good things have been happening in these last few levels, so I don't want to fuck it up now.
[231:35.36]Like, even if I had the rooster, who cares?
[231:36.98]This is a perfect setup.
[231:47.47]Okay, I kind of wasn't just paying... I lost track.
[231:51.81]I was going for the chest.
[231:53.07]Good thing I have these special moves.
[231:54.99]That's why they're here.
[232:07.74]Crush.
[232:09.38]That was a quick level.
[232:14.34]Alright, this is the chainsaw guy.
[232:17.38]He should be very easy considering I have the bees.
[232:23.99]He's already moving over through phase one.
[232:26.15]Okay, this is awkward.
[232:34.73]We're good.
[232:39.74]Just continuously aim the beam at him and the bees will do the rest.
[232:45.66]This boss becomes a cakewalk.
[232:50.13]If you have the queen bee and the angler.
[232:52.45]I can say that now, but watch me get hit by this.
[232:57.01]Here we go.
[233:00.47]Let him do the work for you.
[233:01.65]Although they're not shooting fast enough, this could be bad.
[233:07.93]I'm just going to use it just to knock him out for a minute.
[233:12.44]No, I'm fine.
[233:14.08]Here we go.
[233:17.55]38k.
[233:18.39]More than that.
[233:18.77]Like, 4,000?
[233:19.27]Yeah.
[233:29.30]Save.
[233:32.58]No stealth coming up, but... I'm not sure it's worth getting rid of it.
[233:37.03]Maybe for the... I'm gonna hate myself later if I get rid of him.
[233:41.21]I have to keep him.
[233:42.71]So, we're gonna stick with this.
[233:45.41]Saved.
[233:52.22]The mime is going to be exceptionally easy.
[233:56.66]I'm not worried about that at all in this slice.
[234:03.15]Come on, suck it.
[234:09.45]Use it to have access to it.
[234:10.87]Use the damn thing.
[234:16.65]Come on.
[234:20.15]Yeah, only issue is with enemies on the ground.
[234:23.32]The B is kind of shitty for enemies that are not flying around.
[234:30.64]That's why we're gonna frog every single one of them.
[234:41.26]Welcome to Paris.
[234:49.54]Stick right here.
[234:57.61]Seemed like an opportune time to use it.
[235:07.95]I've been spamming canned bread bullshit for like a half an hour.
[235:10.72]Wait, you got... Why do I always look over at the most inopportune times?
[235:21.36]Give me the gap.
[235:23.54]Roll through.
[235:24.38]No!
[235:24.80]Why did you close the gap?
[235:31.97]Sneak.
[235:37.19]No, don't be greedy.
[235:41.64]See?
[235:42.78]I wasn't greedy.
[235:43.52]Oh, come on.
[235:52.94]Get him.
[235:54.78]Huge wave.
[235:56.14]Just get me to the spot.
[235:57.54]Come on.
[235:58.46]Come on.
[236:05.93]Spot achieved.
[236:08.49]Now lay it on me.
[236:11.86]Come on.
[236:12.20]Lay it on me.
[236:12.62]Lay an egg in my mouth.
[236:18.56]Come on.
[236:22.79]Don't die.
[236:23.97]Done.
[236:25.11]Tentacle or...
[236:49.54]Where would he go?
[236:50.80]Tentacle or save?
[236:52.10]Should I just not buy anything?
[236:59.83]I mean, I could do tentacle goldfish.
[237:02.47]Or I could just... What's coming up?
[237:05.65]Tons of little planes.
[237:07.66]Speedy planes.
[237:13.36]Alright, I can't.
[237:14.54]I didn't do it.
[237:14.94]We're fine.
[237:15.38]No money.
[237:16.18]No money.
[237:19.96]You give me an opportunity to get a Black Mamba, and I'm gonna try to get it.
[237:29.60]Like, that would make the most sense.
[237:34.83]Nothing necessarily has to get replaced.
[237:39.59]This is such a building killer, too.
[237:40.87]I love it.
[237:44.07]All three of those can hit.
[237:50.87]Don't get cocky.
[237:52.61]You tend to do that.
[237:55.67]Just be confident.
[237:57.81]Don't cause yourself a problem.
[238:03.57]Perfect.
[238:06.51]We are gonna get to the White House.
[238:08.09]We're gonna get to the last stage with full lives and a great build.
[238:18.27]You heard it here first.
[238:24.20]I gotta get rid of that tank, he's gonna make everything terrible.
[238:28.58]Got it!
[238:36.03]Got the chest too, and one click!
[238:42.47]So, who was in the chat that said the queen bee was one of the better items in the game?
[238:46.49]You were, you were correct.
[238:49.67]Ah, damn it.
[238:50.95]Just barely missed that, it's okay.
[238:56.68]look again again I look over and what do I see somebody saying something about canned bread I'm gonna get hit here nope not quite that's close
[239:28.31]You know what I'm saying?
[239:31.47]Like, what... What do I do about that?
[239:36.78]There it goes.
[239:39.00]Instantly dead.
[239:41.60]6600.
[239:45.82]So close.
[239:50.63]Save.
[239:53.23]Oh, yeah.
[239:53.75]And the K. I'm going to save this here.
[239:56.81]Not spending it.
[240:02.05]Time for the mime.
[240:07.09]How am I still playing this game?
[240:08.07]Because it's very fun.
[240:11.01]And I would like to complete it.
[240:12.81]I would like to beat this game in front of you all.
[240:18.07]Well, we got it right off the bat here.
[240:19.47]I needed to use that because that was not a good situation.
[240:37.00]If there's the mine, this time I'm not going to just walk over there.
[240:40.76]Because every time I walk over here, he hurts me.
[240:45.88]Oh no.
[240:46.76]Bad.
[240:49.63]Alright, just barely missed it.
[240:53.91]Is he gone?
[240:57.99]See what I'm talking about?
[240:58.97]Get out of the way, man.
[241:04.90]Tongue!
[241:09.41]Perfect.
[241:14.11]Tongue ain't gonna work there.
[241:20.08]Did he hurt your feelings?
[241:21.08]Who hurt my feelings?
[241:22.20]Nobody hurt my feelings.
[241:28.03]And... Time for the boss.
[241:36.39]As long as I don't just die here.
[241:39.83]Get it.
[241:40.03]Get it.
[241:42.81]Saved by the frog.
[241:47.97]This guy will be very, very, very... 8,000.
[241:50.23]Alright.
[241:50.89]Everybody pray for a Black Mamba roll.
[241:53.08]Because this is the only opportunity we're going to get to get it.
[241:55.98]Because I need to start to actually deck out the character for later on.
[241:58.20]Let's see how hard this guy's going to be.
[242:14.92]let's try to go like bang bang bang bang trying to time it so okay so this guy goes first so here we go one no didn't do it right this is so easy with with this build it's not even a show not even a show of contextual
[242:43.92]I was gonna say something there, but I'm too busy concentrating on shooting and standing still.
[242:48.18]By the way, what's going on over here on the left?
[242:53.95]Don't lock me in here because of this nonsense.
[242:58.49]I was gonna say something, but my brain got locked because I had to pay attention.
[243:03.13]So I just started saying vocabulary words.
[243:08.01]You know, the usual.
[243:20.06]This is the end.
[243:20.60]Let's hope we get a Black Mamba.
[243:25.35]I want to see what it is before the game is over.
[243:26.97]I want to see what it does.
[243:27.89]And how good it is.
[243:35.13]What an imbecile.
[243:37.37]I got too greedy.
[243:45.87]That's it.
[243:46.65]Goodbye.
[243:54.01]8,700.
[243:54.79]That's enough for a Black Mamba.
[244:04.98]Okay, buy Eiffel Tower.
[244:08.20]Alright, let's get a Black Mamba roll.
[244:14.92]Because I need to start to spend money, because I have to.
[244:17.18]We're at the last stage.
[244:18.36]I need another tentacle and another enemy.
[244:19.84]I need something else to kill things.
[244:23.79]Come on.
[244:27.81]Here we go.
[244:30.73]No, never mind.
[244:31.39]Sorry.
[244:31.85]Wait.
[244:32.51]Keep those prayers going until I do the minigame.
[244:39.31]Just hold your breath.
[244:40.09]Alright, I'm going to hold my breath until we get there.
[244:44.27]Why did I just... Alright, hold on.
[244:45.71]I'll hold my breath.
[244:46.31]Let's see.
[244:46.53]Ready?
[244:47.47]I'm actually going to do it.
[244:48.31]Let's see how long I can do this for.
[244:50.09]No, hold on.
[245:41.55]What happened?
[245:43.51]Did I do it?
[245:47.06]Why is my head bleeding?
[245:48.04]I don't want to miss any shells.
[246:00.15]shells look I have my breath like 35 seconds that's pretty good for an adult somebody look it up look up what's the what's the amount of time that an adult can hold their breath alright now exhale don't do I didn't don't don't hold your breath it's bad for you it can give you give you all kinds of medical problems don't do it I think don't try this at home I died does that count as a life
[246:34.00]That doesn't count as a life, right?
[246:35.66]Okay.
[246:37.31]No black mamba.
[246:46.77]What do I do here?
[246:48.53]Do I just hold again?
[246:52.22]Buying a tentacle will make it so I can't put a black mamba on.
[246:57.30]Turtle would be, uh... What do we got?
[246:59.48]No stealth.
[247:00.76]Oh, man!
[247:03.26]I think a turtle shell has to come on here.
[247:05.12]Because we have no stealth, but we have a dickload of these fucking things and the bullets.
[247:12.69]I have to replace the, uh... I have to replace the angler for this.
[247:24.28]Dodge him?
[247:24.92]Ah, but... I know you can dodge the jellyfish, but if I can... Because there's going to be bullets flying all over the place too, so I'm going to have to dodge twice as many things.
[247:34.26]Pelican might be good here.
[247:35.28]Can the pelican eat jellyfish?
[247:37.58]I don't know.
[247:40.01]I can add a tentacle and put on a pelican or a turtle, but if I do that, then if we get a black mamba roll, we can't buy it.
[247:50.33]So if I... The safe play is to add a tentacle and get a turtle.
[248:00.80]That's the safe play.
[248:06.86]I mean, we are so close in the game.
[248:14.13]Is it worth waiting for?
[248:16.83]I'm not gonna be able to... I'm gonna have to just dodge Jellyfish.
[248:21.81]And he's gonna hold it.
[248:22.46]Here we go.
[248:24.56]Four lives.
[248:26.78]Just gotta play with an ounce of integrity.
[248:32.77]Dodge the jellyfish, dodge the bullets.
[248:34.35]I'm going to only focus on dodging bullets and jellyfish.
[248:37.05]That's it.
[248:37.69]Nothing else.
[248:38.21]We have two of them to deal with now.
[248:39.63]And jellyfish, probably.
[248:44.41]No, just jellyfish.
[248:45.09]Okay, we're good.
[248:46.12]That was the right call.
[248:53.68]Worst comes to worst, we get a lot of shells for the next tier of upgrades.
[248:57.22]I have a ton of shells.
[249:06.25]The chest will be hit by the bees anyways.
[249:08.41]Don't even focus on it.
[249:09.71]I have to.
[249:11.89]I need money.
[249:12.31]Give me money.
[249:12.83]Okay, I'm going.
[249:14.11]Jellyfish, incoming.
[249:19.98]Which way is he going?
[249:21.56]Just this way.
[249:23.56]They are so slow.
[249:25.16]They're slower than the bullets.
[249:26.68]God damn it.
[249:35.39]Jellyfish incoming.
[249:43.61]Get out of here.
[249:44.39]Gah.
[249:47.08]Oh, this is a pain in the ass.
[249:49.62]They're so slow.
[249:55.64]Alright.
[249:56.38]So yes, you can dodge the jellyfish, but holy shit, I can't turn my character.
[250:01.61]That's bad.
[250:04.38]Where is... There's two coming in at the same time.
[250:07.30]Um... Okay.
[250:08.93]We're good.
[250:09.53]We're fine.
[250:10.53]Just stay right in the corner.
[250:20.11]Good thing I have these bees, man.
[250:23.11]Bees are saving the whole run.
[250:31.47]I'm saving the... big bomb here.
[250:37.10]But when I get a huge wave, which is coming up probably right now.
[250:43.52]Alright.
[250:44.56]Here it comes, alright?
[250:47.58]Three of these guys.
[250:48.36]Fuck me.
[250:51.90]No jellyfish though, so I get plenty of opportunity.
[250:56.92]All I'm focusing on right now is the king cobra shooting the little green guys.
[251:01.64]The beast can take care of everything else.
[251:10.53]Got it.
[251:10.77]Here comes a huge wave.
[251:12.01]Alright.
[251:12.95]Let's clasp the hands a little bit.
[251:14.49]Shake off the sweat.
[251:15.95]Get the clammyness away.
[251:16.95]Let's make this clean with no damage.
[251:20.03]I just got... What did I just get?
[251:22.72]Tons... Alright, tons of jellyfish.
[251:25.24]I'm gonna have to reactivate my thing.
[251:29.28]Like, right... Like, right now.
[251:36.08]Um... Hit it.
[251:38.43]Get that thing.
[251:39.73]Aww...
[251:41.45]Alright, Black Mamba.
[251:43.81]Let's see it.
[251:46.69]Black Mamba.
[251:48.65]Yes!
[251:51.27]Alright, so.
[251:53.58]I think I wanna get an extra life here.
[251:57.18]So this is gonna replace just this one and we're gonna have a machine gun.
[252:04.46]What's coming up next?
[252:06.32]More of the same.
[252:09.88]So, now we replace Black Mamba with King Cobra.
[252:15.99]Bang.
[252:17.43]Now, we're good.
[252:20.37]I feel like this is going to be an easy going now.
[252:24.79]Replace the Angler?
[252:25.61]No, no, no.
[252:27.81]Dude, if it gets to a position with the Angler... Once we get up here, if there's Stealth, the Stealth is so hard to deal with in these later levels.
[252:38.53]No, I'm going to keep the... This has been working well.
[252:40.95]I'm going to keep the frog.
[252:41.82]Remember that... Jesus.
[252:45.44]The frog is for later.
[252:46.48]We're going to need him later.
[252:47.84]We're going to need the angler.
[252:48.78]I can just feel it.
[252:49.94]I can feel it in my bones.
[252:56.04]Absolute destruction.
[252:56.88]Look at this.
[252:57.26]This thing is like already dead.
[253:01.86]That was worth the $8,000.
[253:05.51]I don't like this position I'm in here though.
[253:07.65]Stupid jellyfish.
[253:12.48]Okay, here we go.
[253:14.26]Bingo.
[253:18.10]Dead.
[253:19.78]This thing is awesome.
[253:20.98]Alright, it was worth it.
[253:22.44]I will admit it.
[253:23.54]This is worth doing.
[253:28.29]No jellyfish incoming.
[253:29.29]Imagine having more than one of these.
[253:36.97]Now, my only concern is when I get to the last boss, I don't know his mechanics.
[253:43.61]So I might just instantly lose, like twice.
[253:46.35]But that's alright, because I have four lives.
[253:50.18]Because we're pretty much clean here.
[253:51.76]This is going to be a huge building destroyer.
[253:55.00]I'm into it.
[254:00.88]We got jellyfish incoming.
[254:05.89]Alright, easy.
[254:08.32]Stupid the frog tongue has been just sticking out the whole time No, I'm not fucking around Not at this stage Although I could have used it here Get these jellyfish off the screen Get off my screen Get off Get off, okay
[254:38.85]It's alright.
[254:39.95]We can take a hit.
[254:43.83]We only took one... I gained three or four health points.
[254:50.86]Now we can just focus on taking care of ourselves.
[254:58.20]Alright, here comes the big bug.
[255:00.28]He'll be fine against... I got the frog.
[255:02.70]Frog is great here.
[255:06.83]I'm going to save because I'm going to get another Tentacle.
[255:11.95]V. Place a Mamba with the Goldfish.
[255:20.70]You know what?
[255:20.98]That's a good idea.
[255:22.28]I'm going to do it.
[255:23.42]Don't even kid around.
[255:27.90]No.
[255:29.28]This is very, very much a solid team here, especially for what's coming up.
[255:35.50]Saving it.
[255:37.92]We're almost out of the water, so then we can probably... We may be able to take some focus off of the bees.
[255:41.84]Because they're very much essential here.
[255:46.00]That's pretty much it, though.
[255:51.34]As much as I would love to say that I don't need the Angler, I'm terrified to take it on.
[256:00.91]For good reason, I would say.
[256:04.64]What am I... How am I going to do this?
[256:06.36]What do I do about this?
[256:07.58]What am I... I had to use that.
[256:10.51]Turns out... Alright, everything's fine.
[256:12.39]Nothing came of that.
[256:13.19]I had to use that.
[256:15.55]Everything's good.
[256:23.59]Alright, we're fine.
[256:27.03]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[256:28.93]Too many and I can't aim.
[256:33.53]Ooh, they weren't- they're not slowing down on these jellyfish.
[256:36.86]This is bad.
[256:41.64]I need to recharge.
[256:47.10]Yeah, now I'm gonna get hit!
[256:58.49]Don't worry, it's like it never happened, I got the free health point.
[257:04.60]Huge wave.
[257:06.97]No, I'm sorry.
[257:07.35]It's the boss.
[257:07.83]It's the boss.
[257:11.39]This is all frog.
[257:15.99]Frog does all the work here.
[257:23.58]Bees are still firing too, so that's good.
[257:32.22]Black mom, but never mind.
[257:34.46]Black mom is way better.
[257:38.99]Although, how am I going to get him to run into his own shit?
[257:42.95]Just realizing this now.
[257:44.41]He's going to be everywhere.
[257:54.38]Right?
[257:54.58]No, that's still bad for me, though.
[258:00.97]Just gonna have to play it safe.
[258:02.45]Just let him do his thing.
[258:03.37]Here come the bugs.
[258:13.25]And bullets, too, right?
[258:16.82]Get hit!
[258:17.64]Aww, what's that hitbox?
[258:18.86]Come on.
[258:30.34]Oh, he got double-stuck.
[258:32.16]Oh, look at this.
[258:33.90]Fucking double-stuck Oreos.
[258:37.74]Oh, that was great.
[258:45.84]Run into that, please.
[258:47.12]Just gonna hit one more time.
[258:54.87]Stop causing me some stress.
[258:59.88]Here we go.
[259:06.64]That's it.
[259:07.08]I thought my game crashed or something.
[259:08.70]I looked over at Chad and I got scared.
[259:10.70]That was a lot of shells.
[259:17.62]Well, here we have another crossroad.
[259:23.07]Do we scallop?
[259:26.01]Or do we tentacle and...
[259:29.08]No, we scallop her.
[259:31.26]Yeah.
[259:31.92]Definitely.
[259:36.15]Yeah.
[259:37.93]I got plenty of money still.
[259:39.39]None of these are appealing at all.
[259:41.15]I wouldn't even want to buy them.
[259:46.47]Big guys.
[259:46.99]Got the frog.
[259:47.47]We're good.
[259:48.10]Let's go.
[259:54.12]I have confidence in this run.
[259:56.12]Oh!
[260:00.62]Game crashed.
[260:03.04]Graphics texture unable to create image of size 590 by... No, it's going to be saved right there.
[260:16.45]No, it'll be fine.
[260:18.51]It saves the game every level.
[260:20.17]I'll just have to continue from there.
[260:23.79]Right.
[260:25.80]Right.
[260:27.26]Right.
[260:32.40]What's going on?
[260:33.00]I think my computer is breaking right now.
[260:41.32]Alright.
[260:41.92]Can you please open Steam?
[260:47.34]I physically can't even click on anything in Steam.
[260:50.42]My whole computer is fucked up.
[260:56.32]Octogeddon.
[260:57.24]Can I just run it?
[260:57.94]I have to go into and run up from the performance.
[261:00.07]It's...
[261:03.25]I have to run it from its EXE.
[261:06.28]Chubby's thread, thanks for the $50.
[261:08.16]Not like this.
[261:08.76]Thank you so much, dude.
[261:10.32]I'm gonna get to the bits when this stream ends, but I don't have control of my computer right now.
[261:16.18]I have to run the game from its EXE.
[261:21.38]Okay.
[261:25.78]I really hope we're still there, because that was a really good run.
[261:30.20]Here we go.
[261:31.30]You should see it, right?
[261:34.53]But thank you so much, Chubby's Thread.
[261:38.22]That's incredibly generous of you.
[261:45.48]Okay.
[261:46.02]Wow.
[261:46.48]Thank God.
[261:49.90]That was almost a total disaster.
[261:54.45]Check my PC.
[261:59.91]Let's hope it doesn't keep happening.
[262:01.53]Otherwise, that's going to be sad.
[262:03.70]Yeah, we're right here.
[262:04.56]Alright.
[262:05.06]Load the game, and we're good.
[262:06.16]Right?
[262:06.40]Don't crash.
[262:08.54]Thank God.
[262:11.62]That was... We got way too far for me to have to deal with that.
[262:20.83]Again, we're going to just pretty much only focus on using Black Mamba here to aim an arrow, because there's tons of little planes in this one.
[262:27.93]And when a big plane shows up...
[262:30.44]We take the frog.
[262:31.10]It's a foolproof strategy.
[262:40.83]Perfect.
[262:43.07]Piece of cake.
[262:43.59]This is the one.
[262:44.79]This is the run.
[262:45.43]I'm telling you.
[262:50.79]Frog.
[262:51.98]Thank you.
[263:00.15]Bees will just do work on the side.
[263:01.69]At least we'll get to see the last boss.
[263:11.75]I can't guarantee I'll beat it first time.
[263:14.54]But at least you'll get to see it.
[263:21.48]Quadruple this.
[263:23.74]Such a great building killer.
[263:25.31]Oh!
[263:30.56]Get cocky.
[263:32.02]Take care of this guy while he's here.
[263:33.30]Smash.
[263:33.82]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[263:35.00]Easy.
[263:35.16]There you go.
[263:39.96]Not gonna get... I just want to get out of that position because that's a bad... Look at all the stuff that's over here.
[263:44.94]Nope.
[263:45.90]I ain't dealing with that.
[263:46.68]Come on.
[263:49.35]Lucky.
[263:59.39]Perfect.
[264:01.44]I'm feeling a V. In my bones.
[264:08.48]Hit that plane.
[264:09.96]And you didn't hit the plane with any of your shots?
[264:13.79]You're trying to cause me... You're trying to give me diarrhea?
[264:21.45]Yeah, feeling a victory.
[264:22.15]A V. Don't accidentally use that
[264:35.12]Almost at the end, and we have two more levels to go.
[264:40.59]Why not?
[264:42.37]Seems like a pretty solid opportunity.
[264:48.43]Yeah, we're going until I beat the game.
[264:50.39]That's just the way it is.
[264:52.87]So however long that takes me, it might be another 30 minutes, might be another hour or two.
[264:56.15]I might have to start over again.
[264:57.65]We're going to go until I beat at least the storyline of the game.
[265:01.20]I want to see the end.
[265:05.69]Going against my strategy here.
[265:09.23]It's foolproof.
[265:16.62]Can I break the building before they get here?
[265:18.73]I can't.
[265:29.55]Uh, did I say I was gonna play Alpha Protocol?
[265:31.71]I did.
[265:32.91]But... Alpha Protocol... That was only if this game took me, like, another hour or two.
[265:39.74]So I was potentially under the impression that we only had, like, an hour or two left in the game, but it looks like we had a lot more.
[265:45.72]So... Because we're getting on to about four and a half hours now, I'm assuming that we'll be done with the game in about five and a half hours?
[265:53.02]Not from now, but... You know.
[265:55.86]Alright, what's the play here?
[265:58.89]Hmm.
[266:01.73]This is the second to last level.
[266:03.91]Angler might be... I might be able to get the Angler out of here.
[266:09.79]We can do Queen Bee instead of the Angler, I think.
[266:14.48]I think that's the play.
[266:17.66]Even if it was wrong.
[266:20.86]Too late.
[266:22.30]But there's no stealth, and the last level is coming up.
[266:25.58]So...
[266:30.55]We have one more opportunity here.
[266:35.86]Watch the last boss be a stealth boss.
[266:39.22]Well, I'm gonna have to play real well then.
[266:43.38]I almost have a whole hand of bees.
[266:52.00]No stealth here.
[266:53.42]Only maybe on the final level, but that's okay.
[266:55.94]I don't think they would make a boss be a boss that you have to have stealth with, because it is technically support.
[267:08.60]And... Frog?
[267:16.97]Oh, what are you thinking?
[267:17.89]You jumped the gun on that one.
[267:21.75]You really blew it.
[267:23.77]You're gonna be blowing it.
[267:26.08]Slow down.
[267:26.76]You're this far in.
[267:27.62]There's no reason to take it this fast.
[267:41.53]Shit.
[267:41.93]Sorry.
[267:54.52]Who am I talking to?
[268:01.30]Um, you guys?
[268:02.39]I mean, I'm currently broadcasting to Twitch right now, am I?
[268:10.61]Who are you talking to, man?
[268:13.28]Nah, just the people in the walls.
[268:21.58]Otherwise, I would be very strange if I just was sitting here doing that.
[268:27.08]This is a freeze opportunity.
[268:28.62]Yeah.
[268:38.37]Rush.
[268:39.09]That feels good.
[268:41.76]Jerma, we're talking to you.
[268:43.04]You're talking to yourself.
[268:45.52]That's not... No, that doesn't make no sense.
[268:49.10]See, you guys are responding to me and each other in a chatroom.
[268:55.94]I'm talking through and I'm just letting myself get hit.
[269:00.18]I'm... You know, it's gonna let it die because you guys know what I'm trying to say and I need to focus on this final level.
[269:16.76]More than halfway there.
[269:27.49]Suplex it across.
[269:33.70]And do I need to use it?
[269:35.48]I'm only going to use it in a case of an emergency.
[269:36.98]No.
[269:37.76]We're not quite at emergency levels right now.
[269:45.08]Take it down.
[269:49.44]You don't realize that we're just in your mind?
[269:51.08]We're just inside of your brain?
[269:56.28]Where am I?
[269:57.00]Like in the hospital right now?
[269:58.10]Connected to a machine?
[270:02.22]Whatever.
[270:06.41]Would you guys really even care if you were in the Matrix?
[270:09.79]I'm not sure I would.
[270:12.47]You know, like, you need to take the blue pill or take the red pill and life sucks.
[270:17.72]I don't know, man.
[270:23.48]Remember, Jeremy.
[270:24.88]The second you swallow this pill... EVERYTHING IS AWFUL.
[270:29.76]I'm gonna eat the blue jelly bean, probably.
[270:35.27]And be like, you know what, I'm just gonna go back to bed.
[270:43.93]Trouble.
[270:44.85]Trouble.
[270:47.62]Not enough trouble.
[270:52.52]Yeah, but you get to have cool kung fu skills.
[270:54.52]That's right.
[270:55.23]You're right.
[270:57.33]This is our last chance to do something.
[270:59.97]So we might as well spend the money and get something.
[271:02.49]What do we got?
[271:03.47]No stealth.
[271:05.63]Just a lot of enemies.
[271:06.47]So we're going to add a tentacle, which will give us an opportunity for either... Not enough for a rooster.
[271:14.38]Where do I put this is the question, though.
[271:17.78]Right here?
[271:19.10]Here?
[271:19.54]I think it's going to be right here.
[271:21.72]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[271:24.63]And then, I'm gonna say, we need, I'm gonna, Lobster?
[271:27.63]Just in case, just in case there has to be an opportunity to use it.
[271:32.13]Right?
[271:33.59]I might have to use this.
[271:36.81]We have Symmetrical Bees, we got a Mamba Head, melee, high melee damage, and a Frog.
[271:45.63]I'm ready for the final level.
[271:52.02]Looks pretty good.
[271:53.06]Four lives, four attempts at the final boss, whatever it is.
[271:58.22]Or maybe this is not the final boss.
[271:59.58]Maybe there's another thing after this.
[272:05.58]Let's see what it is.
[272:07.35]I'm excited.
[272:09.59]Don't get too excited and miss your frog.
[272:22.75]Are we going- No, we're not going to- For a second I was like, oh, I wonder who we're gonna save.
[272:27.85]We're not going to save anybody.
[272:28.93]We're going to destroy the White House.
[272:30.83]That's the point of this game.
[272:31.73]Because you're the giant mega octopus.
[272:38.21]Well, I just fucked myself.
[272:42.34]Nothing bad came of it, though.
[272:43.48]So, that's okay.
[272:48.64]Back it up.
[272:49.04]I'm not- Don't get hit by that shit.
[272:51.78]No thanks.
[273:00.85]What's it gonna be?
[273:02.77]After this building is, I'm assuming, the boss.
[273:10.62]Aw, I'm not gonna panic.
[273:12.24]Use any of that shit.
[273:13.40]Come on, kill it.
[273:19.66]I got all day.
[273:25.23]Lucky.
[273:25.61]Alright, let's use it now.
[273:31.02]See, I don't see where the pelican is useful there.
[273:34.20]Imagine if I didn't have the frog and I had the pelican.
[273:36.06]I would have to get to a point where I could go into the mouth and... Frog is just a better pelican.
[273:42.31]Alright, time to pay attention.
[273:54.20]It's alright.
[273:55.52]It was inevitable.
[274:02.80]They'll get plenty of health.
[274:10.18]Aye, aye, aye.
[274:10.60]It's alright.
[274:11.66]It's alright.
[274:12.76]They're throwing everything they got at me.
[274:14.86]God, I implore them to send me a challenge.
[274:20.25]Here we go.
[274:22.77]Is it Uncle Sam?
[274:23.97]I want you to join the fight against Octogeddon.
[274:26.05]I think it's Uncle Sam.
[274:27.75]Or it's an apple pie.
[274:29.11]What is it?
[274:32.54]Final boss.
[274:34.34]There he is.
[274:43.36]It's gonna be... It's gonna be a giant eagle.
[274:46.02]No, it's actually the White House.
[274:47.28]The White House... Yeah, it is a giant eagle.
[274:53.55]Warning.
[274:54.89]Mech Force One.
[274:58.91]Where's his weak points?
[275:00.05]He shoots...
[275:01.99]Okay, those are exploding nuclear bombs.
[275:07.98]I guess he can target multiple.
[275:09.64]We got a Liberty Bell on him.
[275:12.24]What does that do?
[275:13.08]Woo!
[275:14.58]Okay, he has a lot of health.
[275:21.91]Back it up here.
[275:26.71]See, the melee did end up working out.
[275:29.47]I'm assuming you can break portions of his body off.
[275:32.05]Watch out for the bell.
[275:40.43]Not an opportunity.
[275:45.05]It really is Senator Mega Man.
[275:49.35]I can't believe it.
[275:50.11]I'm just seeing this now.
[275:51.66]This is Senator Mega Man.
[275:58.69]Wow.
[275:59.27]Well, there's nowhere I could dodge there.
[276:05.18]Wow, hey!
[276:06.06]Jeremy, here's an idea!
[276:07.36]Don't fuck it up!
[276:15.70]I'm gonna have to let the bees do this.
[276:19.87]What am I- Dad!
[276:22.73]Wow!
[276:25.41]Oh man, fuck!
[276:27.89]I didn't tell you I was gonna do this first try.
[276:32.59]Oh my god, this is outrageous.
[276:37.96]I think you just have to stand underneath.
[276:39.64]Yeah, that's a good play.
[276:44.30]Watch out for the bell when he does the bell.
[276:48.12]Like right now.
[276:50.80]Alright.
[276:51.60]For next time, I'll remember that.
[276:52.88]Just sit under his leg right here.
[277:09.07]What the fuck is that?
[277:10.61]Oh.
[277:39.96]No, oh I finally knew from Okay, I'll get it next time I'll be more prepared next time I
[277:55.39]Yeah, I got hit like six times in a row.
[278:00.01]Nothing I can do.
[278:00.65]Let's just keep it.
[278:01.21]I got my shell now.
[278:02.34]I'm not going to get hit.
[278:03.86]Let's do it.
[278:04.26]Do you know what?
[278:06.76]Hmm.
[278:09.42]Halfway.
[278:10.32]I wouldn't have gotten a hit.
[278:11.18]That's alright.
[278:11.66]We've got plenty of lives.
[278:14.41]Time to get rid of the frog.
[278:19.63]Another bee, maybe, because the frog isn't doing anything here.
[278:37.42]beef of the claw I need the frog for like the yeah that's true it's done alright here we go I know his I know some of his patterns until halfway
[279:03.52]Just play it smart.
[279:04.26]Don't take any unnecessary damage, even though I probably will take one hit.
[279:24.08]Mm-hmm.
[279:29.34]no unnecessary damage I have so much health look at all that look at look at all that money I wonder what's better three queen bees or the black mom by attacking the building so we'll find out
[280:01.82]clean nice and clean nice and no that's not clean dirty dirty dirty I'm gonna get I'm gonna just concentrate and I'll make it happen we'll go we'll get senator megaman this time
[280:30.80]Thankfully, every one of these waves has been fairly forgiving to me.
[280:42.46]Ooh, don't.
[280:43.28]Easy, man.
[280:44.30]Don't do anything stupid here.
[280:48.27]Easy.
[280:48.37]Come on, don't do anything dumb.
[280:53.99]Alright.
[280:55.19]One more building.
[280:57.99]Or maybe not.
[281:00.17]I'm ready.
[281:01.35]Okay.
[281:04.35]Wipe the sweat off the palms.
[281:06.91]Stay underneath him.
[281:07.70]Watch out for the liberty bell.
[281:08.78]Watch out for his cannon hand.
[281:10.94]Shoot him right in the chest.
[281:14.28]I have plenty of health.
[281:17.34]When he started shooting the double nukes, I panicked.
[281:26.30]Right off the bat.
[281:28.65]Here we go.
[281:38.60]Mm-hmm force him to yeah, this is I shouldn't take any hits at all here really like at all Until he starts doing two or three of them I should be golden You jinxed yourself you fucking dummy, it's alright
[282:14.09]Mm-hmm.
[282:14.97]Back to it.
[282:16.61]Here comes a bomb.
[282:20.97]Bell.
[282:24.98]Shit in my face.
[282:27.54]Panic.
[282:38.36]Good.
[282:39.42]Good timing here.
[282:44.86]Here comes the bell.
[282:45.70]Back it up!
[282:47.60]Bell doesn't come out that far.
[282:48.56]I'm overestimating how far that bell comes out.
[282:53.50]By an extreme degree.
[282:58.51]Okay.
[283:10.55]Phase two.
[283:32.79]Bell coming up.
[283:33.91]Any second now.
[283:34.47]There it is.
[283:38.31]Double fire.
[283:38.91]I want to break his hand.
[283:56.85]The hand's coming.
[283:57.47]Hand off.
[283:58.07]Good.
[284:00.22]Now we just have to worry about what's left.
[284:01.62]We have the missiles, Liberty Bell, he's done.
[284:04.08]The hardest thing to worry about is those stupid nukes.
[284:07.33]So, see you later, man.
[284:09.31]Nice knowing you.
[284:10.55]Although this is probably phase one.
[284:17.42]Don't be surprised if he turns into, like, a White House tube.
[284:29.81]Time for his body to break off?
[284:30.89]Or should I try to... Maybe I should try to get rid of the pieces first.
[284:35.30]Play it smart.
[284:44.28]Alright, there you go.
[284:45.10]Yep.
[284:46.32]Oh man, oh man.
[284:47.16]Okay.
[284:47.64]We got some different shit going on here.
[284:51.03]What does this thing do?
[284:53.21]What do you do?
[284:54.19]Bees, baby.
[284:55.37]That's why we have them.
[285:02.95]The whole point of the bees is to make it so I don't have to aim.
[285:14.18]Oh, get out of there.
[285:15.80]Plane's coming in.
[285:29.79]Back up.
[285:39.24]I need to go destroy his... Okay, calm down.
[285:44.44]What just hit me in the head?
[285:46.10]What happened?
[285:47.44]I just got hit in the head with a rock.
[285:50.96]Oh, he's shooting rocks out.
[285:52.18]Alright, calm down.
[285:53.24]Alright, Liberty Bell gone.
[286:09.45]Like it wasn't even mattering anyways.
[286:12.93]White House dead.
[286:15.73]Okay.
[286:16.09]Now I just... That's it?
[286:18.09]Just worry about the missiles.
[286:19.01]His body, that's good to go.
[286:20.15]And he's done.
[286:22.37]Thank you for playing.
[286:24.51]Don't say that yet.
[286:27.58]That could be very bad.
[286:36.66]Yeah.
[286:36.88]See you later.
[286:38.26]GG.
[286:40.27]Good game.
[286:40.97]Explode.
[286:46.55]There it is.
[286:48.15]Now he's gonna turn into the mother brain, right?
[286:49.73]Nope.
[286:56.15]The world is destroyed.
[286:57.27]Nothing else to do.
[287:02.74]What'd I unlock?
[287:17.15]Who's in there?
[287:19.61]What?
[287:21.65]What is going on?
[287:25.38]We're playing, like, Octopus VR?
[287:37.03]Oh, it's just the ending credits.
[287:38.27]Okay.
[287:40.61]Hey, good job, George fan!
[287:43.01]This game was really fun.
[287:46.07]Oh, shit.
[287:54.83]Got it.
[287:55.97]This is the real final level.
[287:57.03]You have to destroy the Monopoly building.
[287:59.45]Can you do two at a time?
[288:05.50]Yeah, let's do two at a time.
[288:12.88]What is this song?
[288:18.62]Is this where we end up going and we go to kill God?
[288:29.30]Always the Monopoly building, yeah.
[288:36.52]Oh, yes good.
[288:40.81]End credits.
[288:41.55]There's a lot of people that are doing the end credits.
[288:49.94]That was like seven, that was like eight people that are doing voices here.
[289:01.87]Special thanks, Mom and Dad.
[289:03.91]Gotta thank Mom and Dad.
[289:10.31]No thanks to the octopus sushi chef.
[289:16.69]There it is.
[289:20.41]I thought I could hit him.
[289:22.33]Oh, Lord.
[289:24.38]Normal mode, hard mode.
[289:27.22]Medals.
[289:30.38]Oh, no.
[289:31.22]No, they...
[289:34.28]Get to weigh 50 in Endless Ocean.
[289:40.80]What is Endless Ocean?
[289:41.86]Alright, we have a lot of things to buy.
[289:44.92]Let's just check this out.
[289:48.63]Other lab slot.
[289:52.35]Dragon DNA.
[289:54.61]Yuck.
[289:56.99]Firefly.
[289:57.69]Yuck.
[289:59.13]That's the thing that shoots when you... Four more things.
[290:04.09]another health point.
[290:05.13]Start with four tentacles.
[290:14.36]Conch.
[290:14.72]And that's all I can buy.
[290:21.12]Let's just check it out.
[290:21.84]Let's check this other stuff out.
[290:23.36]So this is Endless Ocean.
[290:28.91]Interesting.
[290:31.31]Do what?
[290:31.57]Do you just...
[290:32.78]continuously unlock items?
[290:38.76]Let's play this out a little.
[290:45.79]There's probably going to be stations where you stop.
[290:55.41]Just got to trail them.
[290:56.51]Alright.
[290:57.61]Play three.
[291:02.36]I can't get that.
[291:02.98]It's too far away.
[291:17.46]Jerma streams Octogeddon forever.
[291:19.90]No, just tonight.
[291:21.20]Oh, new enemies.
[291:24.78]Only two hits.
[291:35.79]Do I... Do I ever get an item?
[291:40.36]Oh, man.
[291:41.06]That was tricky.
[291:41.98]That was tricky.
[291:43.06]There was only a couple pixels there where that was going to work.
[291:48.86]I have to get to wave 50.
[291:49.58]Did you see that?
[291:58.03]Shit.
[292:02.31]Oh.
[292:04.20]Wave sucks.
[292:05.00]God.
[292:09.30]No, it's too hard.
[292:11.01]It's gonna be too hard.
[292:12.17]Okay.
[292:20.19]Let me just get at least a 10.
[292:21.85]Maybe I'll unlock an item.
[292:27.57]This is more like a puzzle than anything else.
[292:29.84]Yeah, it kind of is.
[292:31.24]You have to decide what time you need to turn your arms around.
[292:34.76]I'm going to assume every 10 waves you probably get an item, though.
[292:38.34]Otherwise, it would be a little... hard to do.
[292:45.49]So, um... What's the story there?
[292:49.09]What's the story with that one?
[292:51.25]Didn't seem to be able to kill them.
[293:00.16]Oh.
[293:02.14]I get it.
[293:04.04]I get it.
[293:12.13]Pause button?
[293:12.80]Let's try, let's do a Cobra.
[293:21.46]Pause button.
[293:23.30]Uh, nope.
[293:24.66]You just, it's just highest wave ever.
[293:27.37]You just keep losing and keep, yep.
[293:31.65]Oh no, don't make me sit here and play this.
[293:33.71]Oh, I gotta play this.
[293:34.57]I gotta get to wave 50.
[293:36.99]Pause.
[293:38.49]What are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
[293:42.46]Why am I getting baited right now?
[293:44.96]You just gotta die.
[293:46.64]It's just a continuous carrot on a stick.
[293:52.32]Alright, well, I... This is... I'm not... I gotta... It's alright.
[294:00.53]I've kind of... I'm freaking out a little bit here.
[294:04.97]Wave 50 or else.
[294:07.55]I want to get to at least wave 10.
[294:15.43]That's not going to happen right now.
[294:18.61]Top right pause button.
[294:20.11]What do you want from me?
[294:21.55]What do you want from me?
[294:22.49]I don't know what you guys want from me.
[294:28.28]What do you want from me?
[294:29.86]I just clicked it.
[294:30.62]I did it.
[294:31.06]I said you baited again.
[294:38.10]No, I... I'm not getting baited.
[294:42.31]Because you didn't pause.
[294:45.90]Oh, my God.
[294:47.84]I want to get to at least a wave where you respect me as a streamer.
[294:52.42]And that's wave 100.
[294:55.32]I'm still here, man.
[294:56.80]We've been going for about five hours.
[294:58.03]I would like to... Because I'm probably not going to play this game again on stream.
[295:01.91]Might as well just get my fill, right?
[295:05.37]It took me what?
[295:06.87]About 10 hours to beat the main game?
[295:10.67]Apparently, this is a hard mode too?
[295:12.91]What does the hard mode do?
[295:17.92]That's something I don't know.
[295:18.72]I'm dead.
[295:21.86]Sorry.
[295:22.12]I'm just going to have to keep upgrading.
[295:25.18]Okay, here we go.
[295:26.02]Bingo.
[295:27.78]Lobster claws.
[295:28.55]I like lobster claw.
[295:31.81]Let's do that.
[295:33.35]And... That chicken.
[295:39.17]Wave 10.
[295:46.27]Dude, there's a pause button.
[295:47.52]What are you, stupid?
[295:49.42]Are you a dumb guy?
[295:55.72]Firefly does no... I mean, yeah.
[295:57.80]I could have done the Firefly.
[296:00.00]It's too much money.
[296:00.56]600.
[296:00.96]Nuclear wave.
[296:14.43]So it seems like the hard mode, I wonder, it's probably a ton more enemies, probably less money.
[296:23.04]So this game is not joking around.
[296:27.86]So there is lots of content in the game.
[296:34.77]So remember, keep in mind, this game is $12.
[296:42.98]I would say that's a pretty good deal.
[296:45.50]I'm not going to press pause again.
[296:52.20]Got it.
[297:04.09]Three, four, five, six.
[297:06.07]Boom.
[297:15.32]Need to be able to shoot you.
[297:16.30]I actually already am and I got the eggs for you guys Take a look at that Don't press pause I'm not gonna press pause You guys have lost your minds
[297:42.78]Crab Claw.
[297:44.20]Only viable solution.
[297:48.94]Okay, I can give my judgment.
[297:50.30]Would you like to hear the judgment?
[297:53.78]Here we go.
[297:55.14]Here comes the review.
[298:00.67]I don't know about this one, man.
[298:03.55]Here comes the review of the game.
[298:08.57]It's great.
[298:08.89]You should get it.
[298:09.31]That's it.
[298:25.10]What is that thing?
[298:25.80]What?
[298:25.98]That's a new enemy!
[298:27.22]What the f- What's with, like, the popsicle enemy that just goes really fast and you can't kill it?
[298:30.52]I'm gonna have to redo my judgment.
[298:39.95]Four letter grades, done.
[298:43.65]Look, that's a full four letter grades.
[298:46.31]Done.
[298:49.75]What the fuck?
[298:52.39]Wow.
[298:54.54]Didn't think I was gonna have to change my letter grade on this.
[299:05.66]And what you guys don't know is that the original letter grade... Oh, that's good.
[299:09.90]This thing's cool.
[299:11.34]The actual original letter grade was a... What's it called?
[299:15.84]S+.
[299:16.35]No, an S++.
[299:17.29]So that needs to be an S+, S, A, A-.
[299:29.33]Yet I can't stop playing it.
[299:37.85]No, I'm gonna say it one more time.
[299:40.01]I would rather shit in my own mouth than have a sponsored stream.
[299:45.71]So, no.
[299:46.17]I would rather actually shit in my own mouth than have a stream that is a sponsored video game.
[299:50.39]Please play my game stream.
[299:51.83]Like, pay me.
[300:07.47]Clip it when he gets a sponsor at some point.
[300:13.16]Guys, I've been streaming... I've been doing YouTube for like... I was on YouTube for like seven years.
[300:19.58]And I've been streaming for like two years straight.
[300:23.13]You think I wouldn't have had a sponsor by now?
[300:26.01]No, because I would have shit in my own mouth.
[300:30.41]You guys all know that.
[300:42.22]Alright, I need to stop saying that.
[300:46.34]I'm probably like really grossing people out.
[300:48.87]I'm being like a sicko right now.
[300:51.07]I apologize for my disgusting behavior.
[300:54.47]But we're gonna get to wave time.
[301:03.33]This thing's amazing.
[301:06.68]Has anyone ever approached me for a sponsored video or stream?
[301:08.98]Oh yeah, all the time.
[301:10.50]Happens a lot.
[301:12.56]Probably not as frequently because I never do them, so I think they get sick of trying to ask me to do them.
[301:19.64]Like, I've declined to do so many dumb things that just make no fucking sense for me to stream them.
[301:26.54]One time I got offered to do an actual MOBA.
[301:31.30]Like a shitty MOBA that nobody plays.
[301:34.00]Can you imagine if I fucking shilled you guys a MOBA?
[301:38.23]Not even like League of Legends, not even like Dota.
[301:40.43]We're talking like some random ass fucking MOBA that no one plays.
[301:44.01]I would hope you would insult me for doing that.
[301:56.32]No, we're not even talking about... I don't think this game even exists anymore.
[302:09.71]What game?
[302:10.81]No.
[302:11.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[302:12.47]That's as much as you're going to get from me.
[302:15.27]No way.
[302:21.69]You think I want to go down that can of worms?
[302:25.31]I ain't going down that rabbit hole.
[302:34.82]No, in fact, I probably would be like going against some NDA or something.
[302:40.96]No, I'm not doing that.
[302:42.67]I got to protect myself.
[302:46.69]Just know.
[302:49.47]And I've never been to sign a contract, play a sponsored video.
[302:55.22]Because what... Look, this is going to... I'm going to... I don't know what kind of opinion is this.
[302:59.54]I'm not even sure.
[303:00.72]I'm not sure if this is a popular or unpopular opinion.
[303:02.76]But it's my opinion.
[303:03.84]So everybody gets to have one, right?
[303:07.70]Like, at what point does... Let's say you had never had any intention to play a game and somebody pays you money to play it.
[303:18.98]Like, what even are you doing at this point?
[303:21.15]You know what I'm saying?
[303:24.67]Like, what is your goal to stream?
[303:28.05]Are you trying to, like, have fun?
[303:29.21]Or are you... Block it.
[303:31.67]Or are you just trying to make as much money as possible?
[303:37.18]Ow, I just turned into that.
[303:39.74]Like to make money, but is that like the goal to be like a broadcaster or a YouTuber?
[303:44.61]Is it just you just want to make money?
[303:47.19]Is that the goal?
[303:49.95]Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think that should be the goal.
[303:53.01]That should be a symptom.
[303:57.04]Some people need to do it.
[303:59.08]Dollar bills.
[303:59.56]I hope I can get the shark.
[304:07.92]Snapping Turtle.
[304:11.92]Horseshoe Crab, five hits.
[304:20.99]But so like, if I get paid to tell you to play a game, that's not even my opinion.
[304:25.65]I'm just like essentially like a computer screen that's showing a video game.
[304:28.83]And I didn't, what even happened here?
[304:30.41]Oh, I lost all my lives.
[304:39.56]Not everybody comes from a wealthy family.
[304:41.62]I don't come from a wealthy family.
[304:44.76]What are you talking about?
[304:45.66]Actually, I want to go back.
[304:56.31]I want to check out hard mode.
[305:00.41]Yeah, sure.
[305:01.31]A lot of sponsorships make sense and a lot of, you know, paid content makes sense.
[305:07.15]But, I don't know.
[305:09.11]I feel like we're straying far from the light here.
[305:12.37]Where a lot of people just are like, ah, I don't care.
[305:14.21]I just do this to make as much money as fucking possible.
[305:16.78]Like, okay.
[305:23.88]And no one will ever say that.
[305:24.90]Of course they won't.
[305:28.62]Alright, this is why it's hard mode.
[305:31.51]New enemies.
[305:34.64]wealthy snob flaunts cash on stream yeah but I I mean I get I understand it I get the point but
[306:04.30]But if you're if you're gonna tell somebody to do something that you yourself would never had any intention of ever doing Doesn't and are you just you just kind of like a liar?
[306:12.35]Doesn't that like what the definition of that word is?
[306:16.11]You're just like pretending to do something or say something because somebody told you do That's a lie
[306:31.16]What do you mean?
[306:32.08]How is that not the definition of dishonesty?
[306:38.50]Not telling somebody to do something that you don't do.
[306:42.24]You know, I really, really just love, you know, like Johnson's Dish Show.
[306:47.49]Oh, it's great.
[306:48.35]It's actually pretty cool.
[306:49.57]I really like it.
[306:50.99]I've never used it before once in my life.
[306:53.13]I'm just telling you to do this because like I was told to.
[307:02.82]You understand?
[307:17.51]That would be dishonest if you did not bring up the fact that you were sponsored.
[307:21.47]I guess.
[307:25.71]That's hypocrisy, not dishonesty.
[307:28.85]But if I tell you that I like this product, but I don't, isn't that just me telling you something that's not true?
[307:40.10]Isn't that what that is?
[307:41.18]Isn't that just dishonesty?
[307:46.66]That's literally every retail job?
[307:50.60]Just wait till I'm a senator, okay?
[307:59.52]It's called acting.
[308:10.21]You'll get my vote.
[308:14.06]Alright, let me... So this is just extra hard.
[308:21.10]Let me go back here.
[308:21.90]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[308:22.70]I want to see something else.
[308:25.30]Let's take a look at the main menu.
[308:26.12]Alright, we got off track there, but look, I don't have a problem with sponsorships.
[308:30.53]And, you know, obviously, unless it makes sense.
[308:33.01]But just gross monetary incentive.
[308:38.95]I kind of have, it's like a pet peeve that I have against.
[308:44.05]I could go off on a lot of different things about this.
[308:48.05]But it's just one of the things that I, just gross, like, greed just annoys the fuck out of me.
[308:56.69]We've talked about it before, though.
[308:57.67]We actually have.
[308:58.17]And no, it's not... Dude, I love money.
[309:04.80]I love money.
[309:07.42]You can buy things with money.
[309:08.86]It's awesome.
[309:10.82]You could go to the store.
[309:11.66]You could buy anything you want with money.
[309:13.82]It's great.
[309:14.40]It's awesome stuff.
[309:15.82]Makes the world go round.
[309:21.36]No, here comes the sellout.
[309:22.79]Now I'm greedy.
[309:23.73]Oh, goddammit.
[309:24.49]Come on.
[309:26.06]See these two files here?
[309:27.56]I got shit on each and every one of you.
[309:29.68]Let's see what's on you.
[309:31.70]Mr. Dragon Breath.
[309:33.98]75.
[309:35.45]Oh, look at that.
[309:37.15]He's a dense.
[309:38.23]He's dense.
[309:38.85]I just want to see what I'm missing.
[309:45.17]I'm missing one, two, three items.
[309:50.34]Damage per attack.
[309:51.10]What's the highest damage thing in the whole game?
[309:57.33]Uh, this is 8.
[309:59.67]1, 3, what's the claw do?
[310:01.89]8.
[310:04.45]Okay, so damage per attack, 8.
[310:06.39]Damage per attack, 8.
[310:07.31]And pushback.
[310:08.95]This is $10,000.
[310:09.65]So why would you ever spend $10,000 if you could just spend $500 on the claw?
[310:19.78]This is gonna drive me crazy that I don't have these.
[310:25.34]Damage rating, max.
[310:28.19]So the 9,000 versus 10,000.
[310:30.91]This one's more damage and does more... I don't know, I guess.
[310:37.84]Rate of fire?
[310:41.58]Interesting.
[310:43.88]What about here?
[310:44.70]Have I seen every enemy?
[310:48.16]Yes.
[310:49.12]I've seen every single enemy in the game.
[310:51.00]That's cool.
[310:58.65]No, Dragon Breath.
[310:59.33]I was just kidding.
[311:00.17]It was a joke.
[311:01.23]You're great.
[311:03.11]That's going to wrap it up.
[311:04.53]We've been going for over five hours now.
[311:05.69]We're going to read the bits.
[311:06.93]Probably take us to five and a half hours.
[311:14.20]The shit we were just talking about.
[311:15.90]Very subjectively.
[311:16.76]Imagine pulling yourself out and looking down.
[311:19.28]I don't look down on somebody because they had a sponsorship.
[311:23.98]That's not what I meant.
[311:29.90]King of backtracking.
[311:32.16]Now, let me tell you something.
[311:33.84]Let's go back and let's talk about, I don't really, you know, it's not a big deal if you have a sponsorship and, you know, have a fucking shitty mobile MOBA that no one plays and you pretend to like.
[311:44.30]It's not a big deal, Jeremy.
[311:45.58]Like, you almost did that.
[311:47.82]Just kidding.
[311:49.34]It's all in good fun.
[311:52.12]But, that's gonna be it.
[311:53.40]So, if you were just here to watch Octogeddon, final thoughts, it is $12 right now.
[311:59.51]That is a very good price for what you get.
[312:00.95]I would assume if you do all the endless stuff and the hard mode, you're talking about potentially like 20 plus hours of content for $12.
[312:09.76]Support, George fan.
[312:12.04]That game was fun.
[312:13.46]I think we can all not deny that.
[312:16.54]If you liked what you saw, there you go.
[312:20.90]Because I thought that was very fun.
[312:25.00]But anyways, let us...
[312:29.18]Head to the outro.
[312:29.80]By the way, Tuesday is going to be probably Lightgun.
[312:33.18]It's going to be absolute nonsense.
[312:37.74]I'll probably just start drinking on stream and we'll play Lightgun on camera IRL.
[312:43.22]That's the best way I can see to do it.
[312:51.48]It's just taking me a little bit longer to set it up.
[312:53.94]Why is there no music?
[312:56.52]What the heck?
[312:59.56]Stream is lagging?
[313:00.20]Well, what a perfect time for me to be over because I'm done with the stream.
[313:06.88]Ends with support George fan.
[313:08.49]Definitely sponsored.
[313:11.31]Like, you want to see my tax returns?
[313:13.73]Alright, remind me.
[313:15.93]In 2019, we'll take a look at my tax returns and we'll see how much money I get paid for this.
[313:22.21]It's a zero.
[313:22.75]I don't get paid any money to play this.
[313:26.44]You want to see my fucking tax?
[313:27.36]You want my social security number?
[313:29.29]Okay, you guys can do your own research.
[313:30.43]I'll give you my social, I'll give you my tax ID number, my address, my telephone number, just to make sure you guys can get the most data you can.
[313:45.96]Senator Mega Man, you need to release those tax returns.
[313:55.23]Taxes.
[313:56.51]Tax season's here, isn't it?
[313:57.61]Yeah.
[313:57.81]I gotta be ready.
[314:00.81]Anyways, thank you.
[314:02.05]Let's start here back a little while ago.
[314:06.59]Thank you, Marshall Magali or Marvash Magali for the $1.
[314:10.13]Literally just finished watching your live stream from yesterday.
[314:13.11]It's like you're making a 12-hour stream.
[314:14.61]I love it.
[314:15.15]Ciao from Italy.
[314:16.71]Hey, ciao.
[314:18.82]Thanks, dude.
[314:20.44]Djack, thanks for the $1.
[314:23.68]Your yearbook picture got reposted to the subreddit again and it reminded me what a handsome man you are.
[314:29.71]Oh, like the high school yearbook?
[314:33.85]Yeah, I... Yeah, I guess.
[314:40.28]Young man in that one.
[314:43.38]But thank you.
[314:45.22]Comcast Customer Care, thanks for the $1.
[314:47.12]That dev must have paid you a ton of money to get two sponsored streams.
[314:50.17]Impressive.
[314:56.67]No, I already told you.
[314:58.01]Look, let's clear the air here.
[315:00.87]No, we already did.
[315:01.71]Why do I have to do this again?
[315:04.73]We talked about Octogeddon three weeks ago.
[315:08.68]Guy that made Octogeddon was like, hey, cool.
[315:12.90]You want to stream it?
[315:13.54]I'm like, I was gonna anyways.
[315:15.04]Fuck yeah.
[315:19.68]One guy, that one guy gets his question answered.
[315:24.62]So if you want the full disclosure, sure.
[315:28.16]I talked to George.
[315:34.16]Over like a two response DM.
[315:41.80]And he gave me like 5,000 codes.
[315:45.33]I got 5,000 codes for this game.
[315:46.81]And I'm going to hold on to them.
[315:47.87]Okay.
[315:51.88]Over two dinners, a lunch, a trip.
[315:55.53]Slide into those DMs.
[315:58.51]You want transcripts?
[316:05.61]Reselling.
[316:06.49]Oh, God, no.
[316:12.57]Here's the long and short of it, though.
[316:14.11]I do have to be careful because I talk a lot of just nonsense on my streams.
[316:18.72]And obviously everybody knows that like half the shit I'm saying is just not true.
[316:22.10]But for some people, they might not think it's real.
[316:25.18]And somebody might be very upset at me.
[316:26.56]And we talk about this sometimes.
[316:27.96]But, you know, what can you do?
[316:37.28]Sponsored by G2A.
[316:41.96]Maybe.
[316:43.62]Yeah, maybe.
[316:44.70]No.
[316:46.96]Thank you to...
[316:51.51]iNunPorter for the two bucks.
[316:53.57]GG, thanks.
[316:56.26]SuperSeal, thanks for the 50 cents.
[316:57.54]The amount of people that hate this game in chat makes me sad.
[316:59.68]No, people were just trying to get under my skin earlier.
[317:03.16]And it worked.
[317:04.91]There was some skin crawling that got under there.
[317:07.57]I had to get the bugs out of my skin.
[317:10.59]But...
[317:11.84]Yeah.
[317:13.32]It worked.
[317:14.73]We mess around a lot here, as you know.
[317:16.97]The Shredder.
[317:17.59]Thank you, The Shredder Genetics, for the $1.15.
[317:19.39]I would like to order a $1.15 joke for my birthday, please.
[317:23.37]On a more serious note, I've been watching you for years.
[317:25.18]Keep what you're doing.
[317:26.66]Thanks, dude.
[317:29.44]Happy birthday.
[317:29.96]$1.15 joke.
[317:32.74]I'm not sure...
[317:42.16]I'm not sure.
[317:42.88]I got $1.15.
[317:43.98]Let me think.
[317:45.62]That's as much money as it costs for like a bar, like a candy bar or like a pen.
[317:51.27]Got any like pen jokes?
[317:55.07]I got... There it is.
[317:59.93]Thank you, Niall Orion for the $1.
[318:01.87]Was watching your last VOD.
[318:07.59]And you're still playing this.
[318:08.45]Cheer, yes.
[318:09.67]I'm finished.
[318:10.45]The game is good.
[318:11.33]Game is done.
[318:15.23]Niall Orion again for the $1.
[318:16.51]This game is like Rampage.
[318:19.23]But fantastic.
[318:20.49]That's right.
[318:23.21]Thank you, Mazons, for the $1.
[318:25.40]Use this to buy a Hearthstone pack or I'll refund it.
[318:29.12]A Hearthstone pack is more than a dollar.
[318:35.64]You have to buy like seven, right?
[318:37.94]You can't buy one Hearthstone pack.
[318:39.92]Isn't it like $1.99? $1.99?
[318:50.70]Here, take this dollar for your Edward Elric card, or whatever.
[318:53.32]Thank you, Snoozencopter.
[318:54.54]Edward Elric?
[318:57.86]What are you on about?
[318:58.56]That is a nice, that is a good show, but thank you.
[319:03.92]In other words, thank you.
[319:05.85]PeeblesW, thanks for the one dollar.
[319:07.19]It's all breaking down because you damaged the delicate meme ecosystem, Jeremy.
[319:10.89]Yes.
[319:12.65]Pin, thanks for the one dollar.
[319:13.85]It's to avenge the idiot scientists.
[319:17.83]Yep.
[319:19.14]Maisons, thanks for the 50 cents.
[319:20.84]Slash me, you have been sued by Nintendo TM for slander.
[319:25.20]Did I make a, did I say something bad against Nutella today?
[319:30.30]Did I make a Nutella joke?
[319:31.74]Maybe.
[319:32.86]Thank you, Maisons.
[319:34.68]Nuclear Chamber, thanks for the $1.
[319:36.08]Do you remember me?
[319:39.34]Jeremiah, Jeremiah, Jeremiah.
[319:43.85]He, he.
[319:45.57]You said that a lot.
[319:47.29]I always remember it.
[319:49.27]Nile Orion, again, thanks for the $1.
[319:50.71]I'm still laughing at the PogChamp joke from the True Crime stream.
[319:53.79]It was too perfect.
[319:56.40]Yeah, that just was PogChamp.
[319:59.38]It still shocks me when I see the clip, if somebody ever, like, looks at it.
[320:02.38]It's crazy.
[320:05.30]Graham Fandango, thanks for the $1.
[320:06.40]One.
[320:07.94]Thank you.
[320:09.62]Ewert, twart, Ewert, twart, thanks for the $10.
[320:11.66]Germany in real life, if you're a very bad man, jurisdiction will not stop the police unless the two countries are hostile to each other.
[320:20.96]Interesting.
[320:22.82]Well, then how come The Rock did that?
[320:25.88]In that movie?
[320:26.46]Because remember, you guys told me earlier that all things on TV are real.
[320:31.25]We had that argument about two hours, three hours ago.
[320:35.51]Thanks a lot, dude.
[320:36.03]Appreciate it.
[320:38.71]Dramos39, thanks for the $1.
[320:40.71]Best pizza, best pizza, best pizza.
[320:43.54]Pineapple on pizza, which is going away tomorrow, so get it out while you can.
[320:47.50]Thanks a lot, Dramos.
[320:51.27]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[320:52.94]Reminder that I love and appreciate everything that you do, Jeremy.
[320:56.36]I hope you've had a great day.
[320:58.86]I did have a good day.
[320:59.76]Hopefully you guys did too.
[321:01.92]Hopefully everybody is going to have a good weekend as well.
[321:06.12]Thank you, Grizzly.
[321:06.64]Wish you the best.
[321:09.15]Waf13Wolf, thank you for the $15.
[321:12.87]How much to bring back a certain meme?
[321:15.13]Me and my friends have had feasts in honor of this meme.
[321:20.72]How much money to bring back a meme?
[321:24.06]Well, a lot of television shows and movies have been based around the fact that you can't bring something back to life.
[321:29.85]There are severe consequences for bringing the dead back and raising the dead.
[321:33.35]There's an entire genre of thrillers and movies, zombies, vampires.
[321:38.85]You just can't.
[321:42.75]I can't do that, but thank you.
[321:46.55]Thank you, WAF, for the 15 bucks.
[321:51.60]Thank you also to Tell.
[321:53.32]Tell for the 95 cents.
[322:00.06]Why do you want me to... No.
[322:01.10]I'm not going to call you.
[322:03.85]Why?
[322:04.29]For what?
[322:04.63]You want me to call you?
[322:07.83]I'm going to call you.
[322:15.29]God, I fucking hate this new technology and the new world.
[322:20.11]Everybody has like a fucking 655 digit number now.
[322:23.07]It's ringing.
[322:31.21]Yeah, but you guys don't understand.
[322:33.33]We're like 400 years in the future and there's fucking 600 billion people now.
[322:38.17]What's going to happen?
[322:42.05]Alto train.
[322:44.66]Thank you for the $1.
[322:45.50]Hey, Jerma, I took my first genetics course today and I was really confused.
[322:48.42]What does DNA do?
[322:51.32]Heh.
[322:55.54]Look it up.
[322:57.88]Just go to Google.
[323:02.16]But, oh yeah, okay, so, wait, wait, wait, let me backtrack here.
[323:05.96]If... What happens when we run out of phone numbers?
[323:10.84]Eventually we will, right?
[323:11.80]If we keep going at the rate of... Like, let's just say the planet in like 2,000 years has, you know, 65 trillion people on it.
[323:21.45]Cell phone numbers?
[323:22.59]What's gonna happen there?
[323:23.29]You're gonna run out of phone numbers.
[323:27.43]You're gonna have to share a cell phone with somebody.
[323:35.17]There's gonna be 20 people on the same cell phone.
[323:39.40]You're going to get every book.
[323:40.26]Hey, I see a foresee a future where your phone rings and 40 people pick up the phone at the same time.
[323:47.01]Like your phone rings and it's like, hello, hello, hello.
[323:50.41]And somebody on the other line is just like, yeah, I'm looking for, I'm looking for Danny, Danny.
[323:55.71]And then like two, like, well, what the fuck?
[323:57.10]Fuck you.
[323:57.54]Like I hang up, like my name's not Danny.
[323:59.36]And finally like four Danny's are there.
[324:00.78]And which one, which Danny are you looking for?
[324:04.14]Danny Anderson?
[324:05.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[324:07.77]Danny, uh, Danny Smith.
[324:09.07]Oh, hey, yeah, that's me.
[324:10.35]Everybody hang up.
[324:13.31]That's the world we're gonna live in.
[324:22.10]What?
[324:22.96]Oh, the codes are... Wait, what?
[324:24.36]People will die so new phone numbers will be freed.
[324:32.46]No, we're going to have 65,000 trillion people on the Earth.
[324:41.57]Peak child idiot.
[324:44.13]Bad joke.
[324:47.05]Does that mean I've peaked as a child?
[324:48.97]Does that mean I've peaked as an idiot?
[324:52.07]I don't know.
[324:53.29]Which one of those two things?
[324:55.92]If I've peaked, that's pretty good.
[324:57.50]I'm in the middle.
[324:57.96]I'm peaking right now.
[324:59.22]That's pretty cool.
[324:59.96]I like that.
[325:06.15]I haven't fucking peeked.
[325:12.41]It's both.
[325:13.39]Eh, whatever.
[325:14.85]I could see it.
[325:15.79]You know what?
[325:17.00]I could see it.
[325:20.92]So, thank you, Altatrain, for the 25 cents.
[325:22.56]Sorry for making that DNA joke.
[325:23.78]I love you, stream daddy.
[325:26.34]Well, I said it.
[325:28.56]Uh...
[325:30.10]Thank you to I... I'm a not for the $1.
[325:32.84]Hey Jeremiah, I took my first pee today and I was really confused.
[325:36.46]What does drinking a large coffee at night do?
[325:40.89]Makes you like this.
[325:43.25]Thank you Action Sloth for the $5.
[325:44.91]The correct plural is octopods.
[325:48.19]It's a Latinized Greek word deriving from octopus.
[325:54.17]Yeah, I know it's not octopi.
[325:57.29]It's actually, isn't it octopuses?
[326:00.34]That's the actually correct word, isn't it?
[326:01.96]The correct one?
[326:04.60]Maybe.
[326:04.82]Einun Potter, thanks for the two bucks.
[326:07.86]They just say cheer.
[326:08.74]Thank you.
[326:13.01]Tell, thank you, tell, again for the 25 cents.
[326:17.41]If you're a cell, do you eat at restaurants?
[326:24.65]No.
[326:24.85]No.
[326:27.14]But you're trying to get me to say like a bad word.
[326:30.88]I'm not like saying, I don't know.
[326:32.90]I don't know if I'm going to say a bad word here.
[326:34.76]It's octopuses.
[326:37.81]Octopusippy.
[326:41.53]No, that's the name of a... A octopod challenge.
[326:47.04]Yes.
[326:50.95]Thank you to RiptillionGod for the $1.10.
[326:52.71]This game reminds me of the stuff I played in middle school on Addicting Games or Miniclip, which should remind you that those were very fun and they were great.
[327:01.38]Uh, Swiggity, thanks for the $1.
[327:02.84]This is the very last day of being in my 20s, so I've decided to watch and enjoy your stream before I go into my third decade.
[327:09.42]Welcome, Swiggity.
[327:10.76]Swiggity, Swanky.
[327:15.03]Being post-30 is, uh, it's a journey.
[327:19.53]You'll start to notice things about yourself that you didn't know before.
[327:22.44]Your body will start changing.
[327:23.88]You'll start noticing these things that you might not be happy with.
[327:27.20]That are going to confuse you.
[327:30.70]You know?
[327:31.38]Your body's going to go through some changes.
[327:32.72]You'll start losing your hair.
[327:36.94]You're going to have to pee like nine times a day.
[327:45.69]Still got five years to go.
[327:46.87]Good for you.
[327:47.99]Stay young.
[327:50.29]but um happy birthday because that's what that means right so you're turning 30 tomorrow right well congratulations welcome to the club thanks a lot to snoozing copter for the one dollar I know I sent a bit message earlier but I forgot what I wrote can you tell me what the message was thank you okay sure snoozing copter it was
[328:13.07]Uh... It was a dollar five hours ago.
[328:16.47]Here, take this dollar for your Edward Elricard or whatever.
[328:20.19]There it is.
[328:21.55]Thanks, dude.
[328:25.53]Um... Thanks to... Getting near the end here.
[328:33.34]Sticks!
[328:33.74]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the one dollar.
[328:35.76]So when's the next Jackbox stream?
[328:37.38]They've been a new one, right?
[328:39.67]There's actually a new Jackbox pack that might not be terrible to play it.
[328:44.23]If we get like a couple people to play it, who knows?
[328:47.84]Try to do the chat thing where like a bunch of people play on the chat.
[328:52.32]Maybe.
[328:53.70]They've made like 20 new ones.
[328:55.47]They made like a compilation.
[328:56.47]I mean like a new compilation.
[328:59.92]It's like a few months ago, right?
[329:02.05]But thanks, dude.
[329:02.55]It's potentially on the cards.
[329:03.91]Thank you, Reaper500, for the $1.
[329:05.97]Stream yourself at Dave & Buster's to prove you can beat Time Crisis in one go for the Light Gun stream.
[329:12.28]I actually would probably do something like that, but I don't think I would be allowed to film in there.
[329:18.00]I would probably start broadcasting, and they'd be like, what are you doing with that?
[329:22.35]Be like, oh, I'm streaming.
[329:23.69]Are you?
[329:24.25]No, you're not.
[329:25.13]And the guy would put his hand over the, you know, they always put, they always put their hand over the fucking top and like grab, like block the camera.
[329:31.27]And then I have to go, yo, yo, yo, dude, what the fuck?
[329:33.31]Don't touch my fucking camera.
[329:34.71]Don't touch my shit, man.
[329:36.43]That's how it always plays out.
[329:37.99]And then there's like a little like scuffle and then I have to leave and then the stream turns off.
[329:44.28]I don't think I want to do that.
[329:48.32]Uh, Mr. Pleasant Gaming, thanks for the $5.00.
[329:52.50]Dermot, been a fan for five years now.
[329:53.80]Just could afford some bits.
[329:55.42]Love your work.
[329:56.04]Thanks for all the laughs.
[329:57.10]Thank you, Mr. Pleasant Gaming, for the $5.
[330:01.29]Appreciate it.
[330:03.45]Thank you for sticking around for that long.
[330:08.25]Hope you stick around for the future.
[330:09.35]We got a lot of stuff planned.
[330:12.75]Carve.
[330:13.17]Thank you, Carve.
[330:13.67]Roll for the $1.
[330:14.09]Dermot, I realized why you're playing this one-handed game.
[330:17.67]You're using your free hand to use your phone and check the price of Ethereum.
[330:23.91]Thank you for the reminder.
[330:26.61]Let's see.
[330:27.59]How are we doing?
[330:30.99]We're okay.
[330:33.70]We're okay.
[330:36.76]Thanks for the reminder.

[330:44.26]Thanks for the bits here.
[330:46.85]Uh, hey Jerm, just got out of the hospital.
[330:48.83]Had a dumb kidney stone.
[330:50.31]Jesus.
[330:51.53]Amazing to relax and watch the stream.
[330:52.97]Thanks for always being there and being the best, most genuine streamer.
[330:57.75]Thank you, EmoTheEdgehog.
[331:02.49]Hopefully you recover quickly from that.
[331:04.13]That sucks.
[331:06.37]I've never had a kidney stone, but all I've heard is terrible, terrible things about it.
[331:11.79]So, take our strength.
[331:14.89]Because that must not be fun.
[331:16.79]Hope you get well soon.
[331:19.49]The Dab.
[331:20.15]Thank you, The Dab, for the $2.50.
[331:21.67]Jeremiah, I have to thank you for introducing me to this game.
[331:24.51]I was originally going to skip it until I saw your stream.
[331:26.81]I noticed how bad you were, which convinced me to buy it and try the game for myself.
[331:31.32]No hate.
[331:31.84]I love you, man.
[331:33.64]I beat it!
[331:34.18]Come on, I beat the game in two days.
[331:35.86]I beat the game in, like, less than ten hours.
[331:40.62]Come on.
[331:43.14]What?
[331:44.40]Did I?
[331:45.24]Come on.
[331:45.84]What the heck?
[331:48.52]I thought I did alright.
[331:49.52]I did okay for my first time playing through the levels.
[331:58.30]Thank you, though.
[332:00.26]For your $5.
[332:04.25]Very much appreciated.
[332:06.43]Except it was $2.50.
[332:08.15]Sorry, I got it wrong.
[332:11.93]Needed on hard mode to prove him wrong.
[332:15.76]No.
[332:16.50]I'm going to bed.
[332:18.88]Uh, thank you though, The Dab, appreciate it.
[332:21.00]Hope you enjoy the game for real, the game's fucking fun.

[335:26.35]Lolladoria, to end it here, thanks for the $5.

[336:25.81]Right?
[336:29.93]Should be fine.
